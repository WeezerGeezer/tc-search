01:07;01:08;"So I argue, you yell, but you take me back."
01:08;01:09;"Who cares when it feels like crack?"
01:09;01:10;"Well you know that you always do it right."
01:10;01:11;"Rip your pride, just take it on back boy, take it on back boy."
01:11;01:12;"You know you can't take it back, you know you can't take it back."
01:12;01:13;"You can't take it back, you know you can't take it back."
01:15;01:43;"You can't take it back, you know you can't take it back."
01:43;02:12;"You can't take it back, you know you can't take it back."
02:12;02:41;"You can't take it back, you know you can't take it back."

03:59;04:28;"You can't take it back, you know you can't take it back."
04:28;04:56;"You can't take it back, you know you can't take it back."
04:56;05:25;"You can't take it back, you know you can't take it back."
05:25;05:28;"saying this is multicultural."
05:28;05:29;"It's all about the experience."
05:29;05:30;"- I appreciate that."
05:30;05:31;"- Have we started?"
05:31;05:32;"- Yeah, we have started."
05:32;05:33;"This is a show."
05:33;05:35;"This is a holiday edition."
05:35;05:36;"- It's not a Hanukkah show."
05:36;05:37;"- It's not a Hanukkah show."
05:37;05:38;"Although one of the things I want to get into,"
05:38;05:40;"and I'm going to need some help."
05:40;05:42;"And I think Ezra, you might just be the man"
05:42;05:45;"for this job is, I looked it up briefly."
05:45;05:47;"The first day of Hanukkah is going to be Christmas Eve."
05:47;05:48;"- Right."
05:48;05:52;"- This coinciding of Hanukkah and Christmas happens"
05:52;05:54;"roughly four times in a century."
05:54;05:55;"- Whoa."
05:55;05:56;"- Yeah, I don't really remember it."
05:56;05:59;"I remember Hanukkah coinciding with Thanksgiving"
05:59;06:00;"in the past."
06:00;06:01;"- Right, yeah, it can go."
06:01;06:03;"- It's all over the place."
06:03;06:05;"- That's the problem of the calendar we're on"
06:05;06:08;"being non-lunar."
06:08;06:08;"- Right."
06:08;06:10;"- Cool, guys."
06:10;06:11;"- But this is not a Hanukkah show."
06:11;06:12;"- Jonah's like, ""Oh, hell no."""
06:12;06:12;"- I'm bored as."
06:12;06:13;"- This is."
06:13;06:14;"- Whatever."
06:14;06:15;"- We're opening this up."
06:15;06:17;"- No, I was actually just trying to use fancy words"
06:17;06:17;"for the moon."
06:17;06:18;"I'm out."
06:18;06:23;"- This is not an ethnocentric, one culture kind of show."
06:23;06:24;"We're talking about Hanukkah."
06:24;06:25;"- We're all inclusive here."
06:25;06:26;"- Christmas."
06:26;06:29;"Those might be the only holidays at exactly the same time."
06:29;06:30;"- Who sets the date for Kwanzaa?"
06:30;06:31;"- That's a good question."
06:31;06:34;"I don't know where Kwanzaa falls."
06:34;06:36;"I know Ramadan also varies year to year."
06:36;06:38;"- Kwanzaa, December 26th."
06:38;06:41;"Isn't Boxing Day December 26th?"
06:41;06:43;"Is Boxing Day always the day after Christmas"
06:43;06:44;"or two days after Christmas?"
06:44;06:45;"- I'm not sure."
06:45;06:46;"And then you guys, the."
06:46;06:47;"- The best part is."
06:47;06:48;"- Three kings day."
06:48;06:49;"- None of it matters."
06:49;06:50;"- Yeah, 'cause let's keep it real."
06:50;06:51;"- Well, what do you mean?"
06:51;06:52;"It matters a lot to me."
06:52;06:53;"That's gonna determine."
06:53;06:54;"- It matters to some people,"
06:54;06:58;"but this is America and the only God is money."
06:58;06:59;"Let's keep it real."
06:59;07:01;"That's what we celebrate."
07:01;07:02;"That's what the Christians, the Jews,"
07:02;07:05;"everybody celebrates that because."
07:05;07:06;"- Paper."
07:06;07:08;"- It's paper, it's money, it's presents."
07:08;07:10;"- That's why we got Trump as a president, yo."
07:10;07:11;"- That's right, yeah."
07:11;07:13;"- That's why gold is the new green."
07:13;07:15;"- And orange is the new skin."
07:15;07:22;"I don't think Hanukkah is very well represented culturally."
07:22;07:24;"Like I don't ever hear about Hanukkah"
07:24;07:27;"other than like family."
07:27;07:29;"I never see it on TV."
07:29;07:31;"- Well, 'cause it's a minor holiday."
07:31;07:34;"- Yo, you think you guys know better?"
07:34;07:36;"(laughing)"
07:36;07:37;"- It's a minor work of the holiday."
07:37;07:40;"- Well, it's not like a high holy day."
07:40;07:42;"I mean, there's no, I don't, I'm not."
07:42;07:43;"- It's a minor holiday."
07:43;07:46;"If it was a Jay-Z album, it'd be ""Kingdom Come."""
07:46;07:48;"That's what Hanukkah is."
07:48;07:49;"- Shots fired."
07:49;07:50;"- Jay-Z would agree with that."
07:50;07:52;"- Is Jay-Z Jewish?"
07:52;07:54;"- No, but Jay Brown apparently is."
07:54;07:55;"- Jew or not?"
07:55;07:57;"(laughing)"
07:57;08:00;"- My understanding is that Hanukkah,"
08:00;08:01;"the really important Jewish holidays"
08:01;08:04;"are like Yom Kippur, Day of Atonement."
08:04;08:05;"- That's a serious one."
08:05;08:07;"- That's high holy days."
08:07;08:09;"- You call everybody, you apologize, it's serious."
08:09;08:12;"Rosh Hashanah, it's the new year, you know?"
08:12;08:15;"And my understanding is that Hanukkah is a minor holiday."
08:15;08:17;"It's really more just like a story."
08:17;08:21;"We just remember a story about a group of religious zealots"
08:21;08:22;"called the Maccabees."
08:22;08:25;"And my understanding was that the Jews show up in America"
08:25;08:26;"and come Christmas time,"
08:26;08:28;"they don't really wanna celebrate Christmas."
08:28;08:31;"Feels funny 'cause they're not Christian."
08:31;08:33;"So they say, ""Well, what holidays do we have"
08:33;08:35;"""that roughly fall around Christmas?"""
08:35;08:38;"And then you got Hanukkah and suddenly it grows in stature."
08:38;08:40;"It becomes a Jewish Christmas."
08:40;08:44;"- But it never really takes off the way we all had hoped."
08:44;08:46;"- Exactly, it does, it's,"
08:46;08:49;"Christmas is a genuinely important holiday"
08:49;08:50;"for the Christians."
08:50;08:50;"- Right."
08:50;08:52;"- So Hanukkah, you could take or leave."
08:52;08:53;"That's my understanding."
08:53;08:55;"- That's what's so-- - No, that's not bad, but--"
08:55;08:56;"- Isn't it representative of Judaism"
08:56;08:59;"that the biggest holiday is the one about atoning"
08:59;09:01;"and how you (beep) up all year?"
09:01;09:06;"It's like a serious, sad holiday, not really like a--"
09:06;09:08;"- Yeah, but I give props to that."
09:08;09:09;"- It's heavy."
09:09;09:11;"- It's heavy and it should, you know,"
09:11;09:14;"it's kind of like doing a 12-step program"
09:14;09:16;"and going to your therapist all in one."
09:16;09:19;"- Right, and you get that big meal at the end."
09:19;09:20;"- And dieting. - Yeah."
09:20;09:21;"- So I'm--"
09:21;09:22;"- Yeah, that's true."
09:22;09:23;"- I don't know what to make of Hanukkah."
09:23;09:25;"I don't think it was a traditional thing"
09:25;09:28;"that you give somebody a present every night of Hanukkah."
09:28;09:29;"- Right, well-- - Hence the America world."
09:29;09:30;"- I know, but I was gonna say,"
09:30;09:31;"but I feel like growing up in New York,"
09:31;09:33;"I think you're right in that it was like this thing"
09:33;09:38;"in terms of modern New York City Jew action."
09:38;09:40;"Actually, there's a couple points I want to get to."
09:40;09:42;"One, the Hanukkah bush came into existence."
09:42;09:44;"Now, I don't think I ever saw a Hanukkah bush."
09:44;09:45;"- Is that real?"
09:45;09:47;"- But people would always talk about the Hanukkah bush."
09:47;09:49;"- Are people gonna listen to the three of us"
09:49;09:50;"talking about Hanukkah?"
09:50;09:52;"I feel like no one is gonna give a (beep) about this."
09:52;09:55;"- This is way too ethnocentric."
09:55;09:56;"We gotta get out of this."
09:56;09:57;"- I was driving here today like,"
09:57;10:00;"man, I'm gonna be in a room with Mike D and Ezra."
10:00;10:01;"That's dope."
10:01;10:05;"And then this is not what I expected to talk about."
10:05;10:07;"I was expecting to talk about other--"

18:33;18:34;"- Yeah."
18:34;18:35;"- Wait, wait, wait."
18:35;18:36;"Hillary lost because of Hanukkah?"
18:36;18:37;"- I don't know why I co-signed that"
18:37;18:39;"without knowing what you were talking about."
18:39;18:42;"(laughing)"
18:42;18:43;"- Ezra, where are you going with this?"
18:43;18:45;"Why did Hillary lost?"
18:45;18:46;"'Cause how is that?"
18:46;18:47;"- 'Cause too many Jews get on the radio"
18:47;18:50;"just talking about Hanukkah all the time."
18:50;18:54;"It's disrespectful to our American brothers and sisters"
18:54;18:55;"who don't care about it."
18:55;18:56;"I just got one--"
18:56;18:57;"- Now Bernie's on the hill, I'm like,"
18:57;18:59;"""Change the subject, they don't like that stuff."""
18:59;19:01;"- I don't think Bernie--"
19:01;19:03;"- Guys, switch it up."
19:03;19:04;"- I don't think Bernie likes the candles."
19:04;19:06;"- It doesn't play on a mass scale."
19:06;19:08;"- I just got one question for you guys."
19:08;19:10;"I was just thinking about this."
19:10;19:11;"'Cause you know every year there's this war"
19:11;19:14;"on Christmas stuff and Donald Trump's been making a point"
19:14;19:16;"of saying, ""Merry Christmas."""
19:16;19:18;"And people are like, ""Finally, a president"
19:18;19:22;"""with some cojones who can not do this happy holiday stuff."""
19:22;19:24;"Growing up, I don't know if you guys celebrated Christmas,"
19:24;19:26;"like my family didn't celebrate Christmas."
19:26;19:29;"Did you care when people would say Merry Christmas to you?"
19:29;19:31;"Were you like, ""How about happy holidays next time?"""
19:31;19:32;"How do you feel about that?"
19:32;19:33;"- I don't give a--"
19:33;19:34;"- If somebody rolls up to you and says,"
19:34;19:37;"""Happy Christmas, Merry Christmas,"" you're cool with it?"
19:37;19:38;"- I'm all good with it."
19:38;19:39;"- Yeah, me too."
19:39;19:40;"- And I grew up, I mean I feel like I grew up"
19:40;19:41;"on the upper west side of New York."
19:41;19:43;"As long as they weren't chasing me down the block."
19:43;19:45;"Like I'll take happy Christmas, happy Hanukkah,"
19:45;19:48;"happy holidays, equal opportunity."
19:48;19:51;"- Yeah, 'cause I don't think anyone means anything by it."
19:51;19:52;"Like they're not being disrespectful."
19:52;19:53;"I don't, they're not like--"
19:53;19:55;"- Whatever y'all do, I'm good with it."
19:55;19:58;"- I say happy holidays to people during this time of year."
19:58;20:00;"I'm with that, I'm a happy holiday person."
20:00;20:01;"- Happy holidays is just--"
20:01;20:05;"- That's probably why I'm not elected president right now."
20:05;20:07;"- Right, you gotta say this."
20:07;20:08;"- If you wanna be president, you have to say Merry Christmas."
20:08;20:09;"- Were you interested?"
20:09;20:12;"- I'm not Kanye, you just need pictures of me and Trump."
20:12;20:13;"- Oh man, we'll see."
20:13;20:14;"- Okay."
20:14;20:14;"- Mod on."
20:14;20:16;"- This is my last Hanukkah train of thought,"
20:16;20:18;"and then we'll abandon it, okay?"
20:18;20:20;"We're gonna pull the cord, but before we pull the cord,"
20:20;20:23;"everyone's shaking his head."
20:23;20:25;"I tried getting you out of this."
20:25;20:26;"I tried getting you out of this,"
20:26;20:28;"and you still will not leave it alone."
20:28;20:29;"- All right."
20:29;20:32;"- I felt like there was a funny thing that would happen"
20:32;20:35;"with Jews in New York where, okay, it's Christmas,"
20:35;20:38;"everything's closed, so you'd go eat"
20:38;20:39;"at the Chinese restaurant."
20:39;20:41;"- Right, classic, good, move, MC, move."
20:41;20:41;"- Right, right."
20:41;20:43;"- Now, probably some people are gonna be like,"
20:43;20:45;"oh, see, how disrespectful Mike Diaz."
20:45;20:46;"- No, but that's like--"
20:46;20:48;"- Dissing a Chinese restaurant like that."
20:48;20:48;"- That's a trope."
20:48;20:49;"- Wait, are you dissing it?"
20:49;20:51;"- No, I'm not, I'm just saying it was actually,"
20:51;20:53;"it was great, thank God, there was like the one thing open,"
20:53;20:54;"and there was like this tradition,"
20:54;20:57;"that actually I think was a cool, modern day"
20:57;20:59;"New York City Jewish tradition"
20:59;21:00;"of going to the Chinese restaurant"
21:00;21:02;"with the whole big families on Christmas day,"
21:02;21:05;"and then, I don't know if they're related,"
21:05;21:07;"but my family, we would go every Sunday"
21:07;21:11;"to the Chun Sha Fu on 90th Street and Broadway,"
21:11;21:13;"and that was like our Sunday dinner."
21:13;21:15;"It would be early, 'cause we were little kids,"
21:15;21:16;"it would be like, whatever, six o'clock,"
21:16;21:18;"and they had the big Lazy Susan--"
21:18;21:19;"- Yeah, that's so fun. - On the table,"
21:19;21:21;"and it was awesome, you had mushu pork,"
21:21;21:26;"and sesame noodles, and egg rolls, and whatever,"
21:26;21:29;"all up in the middle on the Lazy Susan,"
21:29;21:32;"twirling it around as one's want to do."
21:32;21:33;"- Right."
21:33;21:35;"- And it was a very special time,"
21:35;21:38;"it was Sunday night, the tradition,"
21:38;21:41;"in terms of like a holiday, it's like a tradition."
21:41;21:42;"- See, I think that's great,"
21:42;21:44;"that's more of the that I'm interested in,"
21:44;21:47;"than like the, I'd be more curious to hear"
21:47;21:50;"your guys' personal experiences with Hanukkah,"
21:50;21:53;"than like the cultural understanding,"
21:53;21:54;"and stuff like that, you know what I mean?"
21:54;21:56;"Like that's what's interesting about holidays,"
21:56;22:00;"that we're Americanized Jews who celebrate Hanukkah,"
22:00;22:03;"like we're like generations away from how it started, right?"
22:03;22:05;"So what is the manifestation"
22:05;22:07;"of like how you personally experienced it?"
22:07;22:10;"That's interesting to me, you know what I mean?"
22:10;22:11;"Like that sounds awesome,"
22:11;22:13;"that you guys went every year on Christmas--"
22:13;22:15;"- Right, on Christmas, yeah,"
22:15;22:18;"you got Chunchafu down the street."
22:18;22:19;"- That sounds great."
22:19;22:21;"- Eventually we had like a summer house in Long Island,"
22:21;22:24;"and we'd be out there on Christmas day,"
22:24;22:27;"and we didn't have a Chinese restaurant down the street."
22:27;22:31;"So then we fully sold out, we embraced it,"
22:31;22:32;"we had the Christmas tree."
22:32;22:33;"- Really? - Oh, you had a Christmas tree?"
22:33;22:35;"- Never had a Christmas tree in my life."
22:35;22:36;"- We went full Christmas."
22:36;22:39;"- I love Christmas, I just never had a Christmas tree."
22:39;22:40;"- But then my parents shut that down,"
22:40;22:42;"'cause there was one year we were like,"
22:42;22:43;"my brothers and I woke them up,"
22:43;22:45;"we like literally woke up,"
22:45;22:47;"and we were so excited to run,"
22:47;22:49;"like the whole idea that there was gonna be Christmas,"
22:49;22:51;"and that we were gonna get Christmas presents,"
22:51;22:52;"was so exciting to us,"
22:52;22:54;"that we woke up at like five in the morning."
22:54;22:56;"And my parents were like, nah."
22:56;22:57;"- Yeah."
22:57;22:59;"- It's not worth it, you gots to chill."
22:59;23:02;"You gots to chill on this Christmas stuff."
23:02;23:04;"- Yeah, I could not imagine a world"
23:04;23:05;"where in my house growing up,"
23:05;23:06;"there was like a Christmas tree,"
23:06;23:08;"and like me and my siblings ran downstairs"
23:08;23:11;"in matching pajamas, tearing open Christmas presents."
23:11;23:12;"- I don't know, we didn't have--"
23:12;23:13;"- It sounds so fun."
23:13;23:14;"- We didn't have matching pajamas,"
23:14;23:17;"but we ran through the house at five in the morning,"
23:17;23:19;"in darkness, and started ripping open presents."
23:19;23:21;"- That sounds really fun."
23:21;23:23;"- That was really fun."
23:23;23:24;"And then my parents immediately shut it down."

31:23;31:25;"with Mike D and Ezra Koenig."
31:25;31:27;"- Can I ask you a question?"
31:27;31:28;"- I'm taking questions now."
31:28;31:29;"- Turn to the tables."
31:29;31:31;"- We're at the point in the holiday special"
31:31;31:32;"where we are now taking questions."
31:32;31:35;"- Did you ever feel, because you were a famous person"
31:35;31:38;"who was Jewish, in hip hop, right?"
31:38;31:42;"Which is like a pretty non-Jewish, like, performer ratio,"
31:42;31:43;"especially at the time."
31:43;31:45;"Did you ever feel like you had to rep being Jewish"
31:45;31:46;"or Hanukkah?"
31:46;31:48;"- No, it's actually the opposite."
31:48;31:52;"I think for Adam and I, we always felt very uncomfortable"
31:52;31:53;"and freaked out with the thing of like,"
31:53;31:56;"as soon as we first had any success from any of our records,"
31:56;31:58;"not like Hold It Now, but I guess like really"
31:58;32:00;"from Licensed to Ill onwards, it was like,"
32:00;32:02;"reviews of our records would be like,"
32:02;32:04;"""Three Jews from New York."""
32:04;32:08;"And we never, we didn't really identify ourselves as that."
32:08;32:10;"We identified ourselves as like,"
32:10;32:11;"""Yeah, we're these kids from New York."""
32:11;32:14;"But we didn't, because we were brought up as like,"
32:14;32:17;"observant Jews and like, go into Temple,"
32:17;32:20;"that wasn't what we, how we saw ourselves."
32:20;32:21;"- So was it the opposite?"
32:21;32:22;"Like distancing yourself or?"
32:22;32:24;"- It wasn't even like distancing, it was just,"
32:24;32:29;"it was this weird, what's the right way to say it?"
32:29;32:31;"It was this feeling of like, we felt like we were being"
32:31;32:33;"very tightly associated with something."
32:33;32:35;"I think we almost felt Jewish guilt."
32:35;32:37;"(laughing)"
32:37;32:38;"- About being associated with Jews?"
32:38;32:39;"- About being associated with something"
32:39;32:41;"that we actually didn't put the time"
32:41;32:42;"or have the passion for."
32:42;32:44;"We didn't put the time in or have the passion for."
32:44;32:46;"- Like unearned association."
32:46;32:48;"- Right, right, we didn't want to be fronting like,"
32:48;32:50;"""Okay, we're these--"""
32:50;32:51;"- Religious Jews."
32:51;32:54;"- ""Temple-going kids who went to like, Yeshiva,"""
32:54;32:58;"when, you know, whatever, went to not so academically"
32:58;33:02;"demanding, rigorous, very non-secular schools."
33:02;33:03;"- That's interesting."
33:03;33:05;"- Right, at schools in New York, right, so."
33:05;33:07;"- Yeah, I found that interesting, 'cause to me,"
33:07;33:09;"it was cool that you guys were Jewish."
33:09;33:11;"- But is that because you were Jewish,"
33:11;33:13;"or is it because you read?"
33:13;33:14;"- No, 'cause I'm Jewish."
33:14;33:18;"To me, being like a huge hip-hop fanatic my whole life,"
33:18;33:20;"right, and being, you know, no disrespect,"
33:20;33:22;"I'm younger, so rightly so."
33:22;33:24;"- That's just, facts is facts."
33:24;33:25;"- Just the way the Roman calendar works."
33:25;33:26;"- Facts is facts."
33:26;33:28;"- If you go by Roman calendar, I am younger, technically."
33:28;33:30;"But like, when you guys came out,"
33:30;33:33;"it was like a big deal to me, being a hip-hop fan"
33:33;33:35;"and being a young Jewish kid, that you guys were Jewish."
33:35;33:37;"That was like a big deal to me, you know?"
33:37;33:39;"So that's why it's interesting to be talking about"
33:39;33:40;"Hanukkah and all this with you,"
33:40;33:43;"because I don't think Jews are like technically"
33:43;33:46;"always associated with being like cool also."
33:46;33:49;"That might sound like blanket and disrespectful,"
33:49;33:51;"but like, it was cool that you guys were cool,"
33:51;33:53;"and that you were like Jews."
33:53;33:54;"- Okay, well I think this is--"
33:54;33:55;"- Does that sound weird?"
33:55;33:56;"- No, no, no."
33:56;33:57;"- Of Jewish descent."
33:58;34:00;"Yeah, like I wasn't like picturing you guys"
34:00;34:02;"with like peyas and yarmulkes and like dancing around."
34:02;34:05;"But I was just like, okay, I'm like a young Jewish kid,"
34:05;34:08;"but I wanted to be like a rapper or a performer"
34:08;34:10;"and be cool, that's a possibility,"
34:10;34:13;"'cause I hadn't really like had that many models for that."
34:13;34:14;"You know what I mean?"
34:14;34:17;"- So you're saying that we blazed a trail for you, Jonah."
34:17;34:18;"We opened, we knocked down doors."
34:18;34:19;"- I don't think I fulfilled it,"
34:19;34:21;"but you made me think it was possible."
34:21;34:22;"So like, you know what I mean?"
34:22;34:24;"I think that was a cool thing."
34:24;34:25;"- I feel the same way."
34:25;34:27;"I mean, you guys definitely represented"
34:27;34:29;"a type of person of Jewish descent"
34:29;34:31;"who was legitimately cool."
34:31;34:32;"- Pajda."
34:35;34:36;"- Yeah."
34:36;34:37;"- But I think--"
34:37;34:39;"- Is this like an actual term, Pajda?"
34:39;34:40;"- No."
34:40;34:41;"- We just explained it."
34:41;34:42;"- I think we should--"
34:42;34:43;"- Pajd."
34:45;34:47;"But I think it's also a dangerous game,"
34:47;34:49;"and I bet you feel the same way."
34:49;34:51;"It's a type of thing we talked about before."
34:51;34:53;"It's like when you come from a small community,"
34:53;34:55;"any kind of group, it does feel really good"
34:55;34:57;"when you actually see somebody that you respect,"
34:57;34:59;"who inspires you, who's cool."
34:59;35:03;"But the flip side of it, then, is it also hurts"
35:03;35:05;"when you got some big Jewish scumbag in the news."
35:05;35:06;"- Yeah."
35:06;35:08;"- And it's like, that's the game of--"
35:08;35:10;"that's what's tough about when you identify with a group."
35:10;35:12;"- But you take the positive,"
35:12;35:15;"and you just, like, disregard the negative, right?"
35:15;35:17;"- You can disregard it up to a point."
35:17;35:18;"- You look for yourself."
35:18;35:20;"When you're a kid, especially,"
35:20;35:24;"you look for yourself as someone to be inspired by, right?"
35:24;35:25;"Or I did."
35:25;35:29;"It was cool to be, like, young and see someone that was like--"
35:29;35:31;"the dudes I knew who were Jewish were like my dad."
35:31;35:35;"Like, to see that, like, one of my favorite rap groups,"
35:35;35:36;"the dudes were like--"
35:36;35:38;"I'm just saying that it wasn't like I was--"
35:38;35:39;"the whole thing was about that."
35:39;35:41;"It just was a cool little ember for me"
35:41;35:44;"that I thought was cool, you know what I mean?"
35:44;35:46;"That might sound weird, but it's truthful to me, you know?"
35:46;35:47;"- No, I hear that."
35:47;35:50;"You do identify with people who come from a similar world"
35:50;35:52;"or ethnicity or background from you,"
35:52;35:53;"and it's just interesting."
35:53;35:55;"You learn valuable lessons, good and bad,"
35:55;35:56;"because you see somebody--"
35:56;35:59;"you know, just like the same way if you found out"
35:59;36:03;"that, like, Donald Trump, like, it's--"
36:03;36:04;"- Not a Jew."
36:04;36:06;"- Well..."
36:06;36:07;"No, of course not."
36:07;36:09;"Well, his daughter is."
36:09;36:10;"- Oh, yeah, that's true."
36:10;36:11;"- Oh, that's true."
36:11;36:13;"- Hey, we gotta talk about this, to be fair."
36:13;36:17;"- Yeah, yeah, speaking of Jews I don't respect."
36:17;36:18;"- Yeah."
36:18;36:19;"- That'll satisfy--"
36:19;36:22;"but I'm saying, like, the fact that--"
36:22;36:24;"knowing that Bernie was from Brooklyn,"
36:24;36:25;"as somebody who's born in New York,"
36:25;36:26;"lived in New York for a long time,"
36:26;36:27;"I felt like that was great,"
36:27;36:28;"seeing this guy with, like, an accent"
36:28;36:31;"that reminded me of, like, older people in my family"
36:31;36:33;"or something, I felt proud of that."
36:33;36:34;"- Yeah, I agree."
36:34;36:36;"- You know, pride is a sin, but, you know,"
36:36;36:37;"I felt proud of that."
36:37;36:39;"And then the flip side, Donald Trump also has"
36:39;36:42;"a kind of New York accent, and he's from Queens,"
36:42;36:44;"and it's like, this bad guy who's gonna be"
36:44;36:47;"controlling the country is, you know,"
36:47;36:49;"was born, you know, ten miles away from you"
36:49;36:51;"or something, like..."
36:51;36:54;"It's--you know, you have to think about these things."
36:54;36:55;"- No, I agree."
36:55;36:59;"Listen, I've ridden in an elevator with Donald Trump"
36:59;37:00;"more than once."
37:00;37:01;"- Really? At Trump Tower?"
37:01;37:02;"- No, at--going to see--"
37:02;37:04;"- Last week when you were going to your meeting?"
37:04;37:06;"- When I was trailing behind Kanye."
37:06;37:10;"I wasn't in the photo, but going to see New York Knicks"
37:10;37:12;"at Madison Square Garden."
37:12;37:14;"And, like, you know, Trump would like to go."
37:14;37:15;"I liked going."
37:15;37:18;"- Ah, so you and Trump like the same things."
37:18;37:19;"For joy."
37:19;37:20;"- Every time you get down--"
37:20;37:22;"- So you guys were born in the same town."
37:22;37:23;"You like the same things."
37:23;37:24;"- Interesting."
37:24;37:26;"- You both are related to religious Jews."
37:26;37:27;"- Yeah."
37:27;37:28;"- Interesting. Very interesting."
37:28;37:30;"- Well, I don't--yeah, okay, when you get down to it."
37:30;37:33;"But I like your Bernie to get myself out of this sh--."
37:33;37:34;"- Yeah."
37:34;37:36;"- I like the Bernie analogy, 'cause I did always feel like--"
37:36;37:40;"I felt like Bernie was, like, kind of like this funny,"
37:40;37:42;"familiar, intellectual Jewish uncle"
37:42;37:44;"that I would see at, like, Passover."

44:22;44:25;"- We're gonna do a blind vodka tasting here."
44:25;44:26;"- Oh, really?"
44:26;44:27;"- Snap."
44:27;44:28;"- Yeah, wait, what do I have?"
44:28;44:30;"- Why, like Pepsi challenge?"
44:30;44:32;"- Think of it as if you were going"
44:32;44:34;"to an esteemed wine tasting, right?"
44:34;44:35;"You're just gonna taste blind."
44:35;44:37;"You're not gonna know where the vodka is from."
44:37;44:39;"- Is it from a famous Jewish deli out here?"
44:39;44:41;"- There's, but before we get into the domain."
44:41;44:42;"- Okay."
44:42;44:44;"- Wait, we again, this is being too ethnocentric."
44:44;44:46;"There's a lot of people listening."
44:46;44:48;"- Potato, who can't relate to a potato pancake?"
44:48;44:49;"- But I'm saying, we had to explain,"
44:49;44:50;"they don't even know what vodka is."
44:50;44:52;"- Yeah, you're no worse than Madoff right now."
44:52;44:53;"- Yeah."
44:53;44:55;"- You're no better, no better."
44:55;44:57;"- We gotta project our people in a positive--"
44:57;44:58;"- Stop going to Knicks games with Trump"

45:01;45:05;"- Mike Deed just, obviously it's an elitist food."
45:05;45:06;"I mean--"
45:06;45:07;"- Not even trying to explain."
45:07;45:08;"- I mean, I think if we get down to it,"
45:08;45:09;"I don't know what the history of vodka is."
45:09;45:11;"It's potato pancake, number one."
45:11;45:14;"I don't know what makes a vodka so different than--"
45:14;45:16;"- Oh man, these are real good."
45:16;45:18;"- What makes a potato pancake, like a vodka,"
45:18;45:19;"so different than home fries?"
45:19;45:21;"- It's shaped like a perfect circle."
45:21;45:23;"- It's a potato croquette."
45:23;45:26;"- No, 'cause croquette, I feel like is round."
45:26;45:27;"- Croquetas."
45:27;45:28;"- A vodka is round but flat."
45:28;45:30;"- Well, you're not gonna try any of this?"
45:30;45:31;"- No, I'm in."
45:31;45:32;"I don't know, you know, I'm really,"
45:32;45:35;"although guys, this is gonna be very Jewish of me."
45:35;45:36;"I recently got gluten free."
45:36;45:37;"Or maybe it's very LA of me."
45:37;45:38;"- That's LA."
45:38;45:39;"- That's LA, man."
45:39;45:40;"- I recently--"
45:40;45:42;"- Damn, Hollywood Mike Deed."
45:42;45:45;"- I take back that childhood inspiration thing, man."
45:45;45:47;"- I'm just saying right now, I'm outing myself."
45:47;45:48;"- If I knew who you were now."
45:48;45:49;"- I'm outing myself."
45:49;45:50;"- Gluten free is not a Jewish thing."
45:50;45:51;"- I'm two weeks deep in the gluten."
45:51;45:52;"- Can I try one of these?"
45:52;45:54;"- Yeah, no, this is, wait, so yeah, so try."
45:54;45:57;"The first mission here is, I'm just curious,"
45:57;46:00;"one to 10, establish a point rating to each Laika."
46:00;46:01;"So don't cross pollinate."
46:01;46:03;"- I didn't know these mother (beep)"
46:03;46:04;"were gonna be served ice cold, by the way."
46:04;46:05;"- They're plated in front of the--"
46:05;46:08;"- These mother (beep) feel like popsicles."
46:08;46:09;"Laika popsicles."
46:09;46:11;"- These are room temperature."
46:11;46:13;"Wait, so we're not supposed to dip these?"
46:13;46:14;"- They're supposed to be warm."
46:14;46:15;"- They're supposed to be warm, all right."
46:15;46:16;"I'm coming around, I'm moving around."
46:16;46:18;"But now, hold on, that's plate A,"
46:18;46:20;"which is in front of Jonah."
46:20;46:22;"- But we can still dip it in the applesauce?"
46:22;46:23;"- Yeah, yeah."
46:23;46:24;"- Okay, yeah, I love the applesauce."
46:24;46:25;"- And whatever Laika, and then again,"
46:25;46:28;"to clarify what Laikas are to people,"
46:28;46:30;"'cause I feel very bad and elitist,"
46:30;46:31;"and I'm not gonna sleep for--"
46:31;46:32;"- They're like Jew hash browns."
46:32;46:34;"- Jew hash browns, and they're like Jewish hash browns,"
46:34;46:36;"but then typically you dip them,"
46:36;46:38;"and I don't know where the tradition comes from,"
46:38;46:40;"but you dip it in applesauce,"
46:40;46:42;"or you also have sour cream, right?"
46:42;46:43;"- Mm-hmm."
46:43;46:45;"- But now, do some people double dip"
46:45;46:47;"and go applesauce and sour cream?"
46:47;46:48;"- Yeah, probably."
46:48;46:49;"- Yeah, yeah."
46:49;46:50;"- This one's a little chewy."
46:50;46:51;"(laughing)"
46:51;46:52;"This one's chewy."
46:52;46:53;"- Not loving it."
46:53;46:54;"- I'll give this like--"
46:54;46:56;"- Can I tell you one of my favorite lines?"
46:56;46:58;"Because you repped Fatburger in a rap song,"
46:58;47:00;"and that's just like amazing to me,"
47:00;47:01;"'cause I grew up going to Fatburger."
47:01;47:02;"- Well, that was a huge deal."
47:02;47:03;"That was a huge deal to us."
47:03;47:04;"Like the first time we came to LA,"
47:04;47:06;"we went to Fatburger, it was mind-blowing."
47:06;47:09;"Because we didn't have a fast food burger"
47:09;47:10;"that was on that level."
47:10;47:11;"- On that level, yeah."
47:11;47:12;"- In New York."
47:12;47:13;"- Yeah, 'cause that's an interesting--"
47:13;47:15;"- I go to White Castle 'cause it's the best."
47:15;47:17;"- Right, Fatburger when I'm way out west."
47:17;47:18;"- Yeah, big deal to me."
47:18;47:19;"That was a big deal."
47:19;47:20;"- Yeah, 'cause back then,"
47:20;47:22;"Fatburger, it was our spot."
47:22;47:23;"- 'Cause then--"
47:23;47:24;"- An apple pen."
47:24;47:26;"- So in New York, you had McDonald's,"
47:26;47:28;"White Castle, Burger King, whatever."
47:28;47:30;"- Like real fast, like fast food, fast food, right?"
47:30;47:32;"- Yeah, really fast, with the little thin burger."
47:32;47:34;"But then Fatburger really was like a--"
47:34;47:35;"- But it's not fast food, though."
47:35;47:36;"- Like a legit burger."
47:36;47:38;"It was like a, you know, like it was a thin--"
47:38;47:39;"- Right, but nowadays,"
47:39;47:40;"when people come from New York to LA,"
47:40;47:41;"the first place they go is In-N-Out."
47:41;47:42;"- Which is whack."
47:42;47:43;"- Right."
47:43;47:44;"- They shouldn't do that."
47:44;47:45;"- Really?"
47:45;47:46;"- That's sus as--"
47:46;47:47;"- Really?"
47:47;47:48;"- Dude, Apple Pen's the best burger,"
47:48;47:49;"and Fatburger's better than In-N-Out."
47:49;47:50;"In-N-Out sucks, and their fries suck."
47:50;47:51;"In-N-Out."
47:51;47:52;"And they don't celebrate Hanukkah."
47:52;47:53;"- What?"
47:53;47:54;"(laughing)"
47:54;47:57;"- I didn't see one Hanukkah decoration in In-N-Out."
47:57;47:59;"- And Bernie Madoff was their single biggest investor."
47:59;48:01;"- In-N-Out says happy holidays."
48:01;48:03;"- And they serve truffle fries there now."
48:03;48:05;"- Wait, so where is this one from?"
48:05;48:06;"- Wait, I gotta, wait, no, we're not gonna,"
48:06;48:09;"we're gonna wait, we gotta go to Vodka B,"
48:09;48:11;"but I'm coming over to taste Vodka A first."
48:11;48:13;"- I'm already on Vodka B, but there's only one,"
48:13;48:14;"it's not like a chain or anything."
48:14;48:15;"- Is there something we're supposed to do"
48:15;48:17;"to cleanse our palates between vodka bites?"
48:17;48:19;"- I don't know, a shot of vodka?"
48:19;48:20;"That is, that's a thing."
48:20;48:21;"- No, that's true, that is a tradition."
48:21;48:22;"- People drink--"
48:22;48:23;"- That's like a thing with Russia."
48:23;48:24;"- That's Russian."
48:24;48:26;"- Russian, well, yeah, all Eastern Europeans."
48:26;48:28;"- Johnny, we need some vodka in here."
48:28;48:29;"(laughing)"
48:29;48:30;"- Oh no."
48:30;48:32;"- I can't tell, I think Vodka 2 might be better."
48:32;48:33;"- Vodka 2's better."
48:33;48:35;"- It's crispier, like Ezra's mom used to make."
48:35;48:36;"- That's right."
48:36;48:37;"- Just like mama used to make."
48:37;48:38;"- That's right."
48:38;48:41;"- I feel like Vodka number 2 is devoid of potato taste."
48:41;48:44;"I don't like, I want it to taste like a potato."
48:44;48:46;"- Mm, very disrespectful."
48:46;48:47;"- That's very disrespectful."
48:47;48:48;"- We're all about respect,"
48:48;48:50;"we were having a respect conversation before."
48:50;48:51;"- Yeah, we care about respect."
48:51;48:54;"- Potato was unearthed for me."
48:54;48:56;"- Can I drop a truth bomb right now?"
48:56;48:57;"- Yeah, man."
48:57;48:59;"- I'm all about the theories and challenging truth."
48:59;49:01;"You know where potatoes come from?"
49:01;49:02;"- Not Ireland?"
49:02;49:04;"- No, they come from South America."
49:04;49:06;"So nobody in Europe had ever had,"
49:06;49:08;"nobody in the old world had ever had a potato"
49:08;49:12;"until, let's say, bare minimum, you know, 1490-something."
49:12;49:14;"- So you're blaming the latkes, Columbus?"
49:14;49:15;"- Well, kind of."
49:15;49:17;"I mean, well, I'm not mad at latkes,"
49:17;49:19;"I'm just saying it's interesting that that means"
49:19;49:21;"if our ancestors in Eastern Europe,"
49:21;49:23;"they could have started making latkes"
49:23;49:25;"no earlier than the 16th century."
49:25;49:28;"So that means the original Hebrews living in the Middle East,"
49:28;49:30;"not only would they have never had latkes,"
49:30;49:32;"they never would have had potatoes."
49:32;49:33;"So this is a relatively recent--"
49:33;49:35;"- So you're saying the whole latke thing is a fallacy."
49:35;49:36;"- Well, I'm saying--"
49:36;49:38;"- If Jewish people have been around for--"
49:38;49:39;"- It's a mockery of a shun."
49:39;49:41;"- What year is it in the Jewish calendar?"
49:41;49:44;"It's '50s, it's like '57-something?"
49:44;49:46;"I'm just saying, Jewish people have been around"
49:46;49:49;"for almost 6,000 years, but they've been eating latkes--"
49:49;49:51;"- For a small fraction of that."
49:51;49:53;"- For no more than, for about a tenth of that time."
49:53;49:56;"So Jewish people, are you telling me that the latke"
49:56;49:58;"is the food that represents you?"
49:58;49:59;"- Well-- - Jonah, how do you feel?"
49:59;50:01;"How do you feel, fam, right now?"
50:01;50:05;"- I feel disrespected by Ezra."
50:05;50:10;"I feel disrespected by the assumption,"
50:10;50:15;"and even to presuppose that a latke was not enjoyed"
50:15;50:19;"by my great, great, great, great, great, great, great ancestors."
50:19;50:21;"- I'm sorry, the truth. - Because all I know is--"
50:21;50:22;"- Oh, sweet, so?"
50:22;50:27;"- In the Jewish calendar, it's the year 5,777."
50:27;50:29;"- All right, but when, I want to establish"
50:29;50:31;"when the potato crossed over."
50:31;50:34;"- The latke was invented in 1992 by Suge Knight."
50:34;50:36;"- Now we're talking."
50:36;50:39;"- By Suge Knight and D.O.C."
50:39;50:41;"- All right, I'm going into latke number three."
50:41;50:43;"I'm gonna tell right now-- - Latke number three sucks."
50:43;50:45;"- Just ripping off a bite of it. - Really?"
50:45;50:47;"- It's greasy as fuck. - It just sucks."
50:47;50:49;"I think two's the winner. Ezra, what you think, man?"
50:49;50:51;"- I'm with you, number two. - Mike?"
50:51;50:54;"- I don't--number three's-- - Number three's trash."
50:54;50:56;"- That ain't right. I put that in there."
50:56;50:58;"That ain't right, Kyron. Greasy."
50:58;51:00;"- It just sucks. - I like--"
51:00;51:02;"- It's like a dog with wet hair."
51:02;51:04;"- Yeah. - You don't want that."
51:04;51:07;"- Deep down, I've always seen latkes primarily as a--"
51:07;51:09;"- Crispy. - And as an applesauce"

58:15;58:16;"- In drops."
58:16;58:18;"- In 1536, it's a big drop."
58:18;58:20;"So probably at first it's in Spain,"
58:20;58:21;"but there were many trade--"
58:21;58:22;"- Apple exclusive."
58:22;58:24;"- It was an apple exclusive."
58:24;58:25;"There was a window period about two weeks"
58:25;58:26;"where they only had--"
58:26;58:28;"- Saint Lowe did one of those two hour interviews"
58:28;58:30;"where he kisses the potato's ass for two hours."
58:30;58:33;"- He's like, now, so when you first arrived,"
58:33;58:37;"you first arrived in Spain, okay?"
58:37;58:39;"And you're looking at these Spanish people,"
58:39;58:40;"and what were you thinking?"
58:40;58:42;"They were like, you were like the new Kanye of Spain."
58:42;58:43;"- That's right."
58:43;58:46;"So let's say that they start trading potatoes,"
58:46;58:49;"maybe potatoes make it to Eastern Europe,"
58:49;58:52;"you know, Poland, Russia, wherever, 10, 20 years later."
58:52;58:54;"So then it's, you know, 1550,"
58:54;58:56;"and then somebody has to think to start frying them up,"
58:56;58:58;"and then somebody has to start thinking"
58:58;59:00;"to frying them up at Hanukkah."
59:00;59:01;"I'm just saying that eating latkes"
59:01;59:04;"is probably a 400 year tradition."
59:04;59:05;"So that's still a tradition."
59:05;59:07;"- That's still old, I mean, listen."
59:07;59:10;"I mean, in terms of the history of this country,"
59:10;59:11;"that's old as--"
59:11;59:13;"- It's very old, but that also means that"
59:13;59:16;"in a mere 400 years, Mike D's Hanukkah special"
59:16;59:19;"could be part of the Jewish tradition."
59:19;59:20;"I'm just saying, they're not ancient."
59:20;59:23;"- I feel like the latke is like what Ezra"
59:23;59:24;"was talking about, the delivery device."
59:24;59:26;"Like you had the latke sandwiches,"
59:26;59:28;"you really gotta look at it as a device"
59:28;59:30;"of bringing in other food into the game."
59:30;59:31;"- Changing things up."
59:31;59:33;"- Where people used to have, maybe use bread,"
59:33;59:35;"and you have the latke, that would be like in LA."
59:35;59:38;"- Well, back in the day, bread had less gluten in it."
59:38;59:39;"- Yeah."
59:39;59:40;"Wait, what?"
59:40;59:41;"Hold on, hold on."
59:41;59:43;"I didn't mean to drop so many truth bombs."
59:43;59:44;"- Yeah, man."
59:44;59:46;"- Give me a bomb."
59:46;59:49;"(high-pitched squealing)"
59:49;59:51;"Back in the day, bread had less gluten in it."
59:51;59:52;"- Why has that changed?"
59:52;59:56;"- Because of industrial farming."
59:56;59:57;"Monsanto."
59:57;59:59;"- Okay, so post-World War II."
59:59;01:00:04;"- The CIA, Illuminati, they started, man,"
01:00:04;01:00:05;"okay, take this with a grain of salt,"
01:00:05;01:00:07;"but it used to be there were many types of wheats"
01:00:07;01:00:08;"all over the world."
01:00:08;01:00:10;"You live here, you eat this type of wheat,"
01:00:10;01:00:12;"you live there, you eat one type of wheat."
01:00:12;01:00:14;"As with bananas and a lot of other things"
01:00:14;01:00:17;"that are controlled by gigantic, disgusting conglomerations,"
01:00:17;01:00:20;"they start making just one type of wheat."
01:00:20;01:00:23;"There's no diversity in wheat anymore."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"So we keep getting this, as they bred the wheat,"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"we got this very high-gluten concept."
01:00:27;01:00:30;"That's why when you go to your Whole Foods,"
01:00:30;01:00:34;"to your Erawans, to your local organic market,"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"you're gonna see a lot of ancient grains,"
01:00:36;01:00:39;"because people are trying to get back to the old grains"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"that were healthier, had less gluten."
01:00:41;01:00:46;"So here we are, we're eating potatoes,"
01:00:46;01:00:47;"we're eating corporate wheat,"
01:00:47;01:00:53;"and meanwhile, the ancient grains are sitting empty."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"We got thieves in the temple."
01:00:54;01:00:57;"- It smells like lock in this so hard."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"- I think it's, I'm telling you,"
01:00:58;01:00:59;"I think it's the greasy one,"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"the greasy one that's really stinking stuff up."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"All right, so let's wait, first real quick,"
01:01:03;01:01:04;"what's the winner?"
01:01:04;01:01:05;"We know we have the clear loser."
01:01:05;01:01:08;"Lock in number three sucked, straight up."
01:01:08;01:01:09;"- Trash."
01:01:09;01:01:10;"- I mean, that ain't right."
01:01:10;01:01:13;"Ezra, your mouth's full of lock in right now,"
01:01:13;01:01:13;"but I think we all agree,"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"we're lock in three is trash."
01:01:15;01:01:15;"- I didn't like one either."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"I thought one and three were both bad."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"- Better than three."
01:01:18;01:01:19;"- I thought two."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"- Yeah, I would take, one I could eat."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"Three was inedible."
01:01:21;01:01:24;"- Yeah, one at least wasn't just straight up--"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"- It's like a time."
01:01:25;01:01:25;"- Like three was--"
01:01:25;01:01:29;"- If I was starving, I could flip you off with number one."
01:01:29;01:01:31;"- One is not bad, two is just good."
01:01:31;01:01:34;"- Three was an F, one was a C minus."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"- I say C plus."
01:01:35;01:01:35;"- All right, C plus."
01:01:35;01:01:36;"- Yeah, I'll C plus, I agree."
01:01:36;01:01:37;"- I mean, you guys don't have to agree with me,"
01:01:37;01:01:38;"that's just my opinion."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"- I mean, to be honest, but look,"
01:01:40;01:01:41;"number two is still,"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"nothing ever got better than a B minus for me."
01:01:43;01:01:44;"- I think two is pretty good."
01:01:44;01:01:45;"- Two is good."
01:01:45;01:01:47;"- They just had to sat out for a cold."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"- You're giving it a B plus?"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"- I don't know why you guys popped these in the freezer"
01:01:50;01:01:51;"before you brought them out here."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"That seemed unnecessary."
01:01:53;01:01:54;"- Yeah."
01:01:54;01:01:55;"- You should have shoved a stick in them"
01:01:55;01:01:56;"and made some moccasins."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"- They needed to be hot and crispy."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"My culinary staff was not--"
01:01:59;01:02:01;"- Yeah, they gotta be fresh off your grandma's pan."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"- My crack staff was not cracked today."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"I don't know what, they are on crack."
01:02:05;01:02:06;"I don't know what happened."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"- Yeah."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"- All right, so we have a clear winner, number two."
01:02:09;01:02:12;"Colin, where is number two from?"
01:02:12;01:02:12;"- I just saw it."
01:02:12;01:02:14;"- Don't, do not even tell me."
01:02:14;01:02:14;"- Not number two."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"- These are Trader Joe's."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"- Wow."
01:02:17;01:02:20;"- No, it said no both from Trader Joe's."
01:02:20;01:02:23;"So our winner in the Lodka shootout is from Trader Joe's."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"- But I can defend why,"
01:02:25;01:02:26;"because they were probably frozen from Trader Joe's"
01:02:26;01:02:27;"and you had to cook them,"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"which means they were freshly cooked,"
01:02:29;01:02:32;"which unravels all of the theory of where these are,"
01:02:32;01:02:33;"the others were takeout."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"- The other ones were takeout?"
01:02:34;01:02:35;"- Meaning that these ones were cooked,"
01:02:35;01:02:38;"that's why they're from the pan sooner than the other one."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"- Uh oh, recount."
01:02:40;01:02:41;"- Damn."
01:02:41;01:02:42;"(laughing)"
01:02:42;01:02:42;"- Putin."
01:02:42;01:02:45;"(laughing)"
01:02:45;01:02:46;"- You got a Putin drop?"
01:02:46;01:02:47;"- Message."
01:02:47;01:02:50;"- So yeah, we are Putin right now."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"- Damn, I just a beautiful minded the fuck out"
01:02:52;01:02:54;"of this whole Lodka contest."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"I was like drawing,"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"I was drawing on that glass over there on that window,"
01:02:57;01:02:58;"just drawing formulas."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"- So for curiosity's sake,"
01:03:00;01:03:03;"and we now have established we have a non-scientific poll,"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"but I wanna know number three."
01:03:04;01:03:07;"- Okay, so number three from the most hated was from?"
01:03:07;01:03:08;"- Was from Jones."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"- Jones on third?"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"- Oh man, how you gonna eat Lodka from there?"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"- They probably have a truffle Lodka,"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"or a truffle something."
01:03:15;01:03:16;"- Jones probably Jewish."
01:03:16;01:03:18;"- Jones ain't Jewish."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"- Really?"
01:03:19;01:03:20;"(laughing)"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"- I don't know, I just think it's funny for me"
01:03:22;01:03:25;"to have beef with Jones for no reason."
01:03:25;01:03:26;"- Jones."
01:03:26;01:03:27;"- How could you?"
01:03:27;01:03:28;"- Aw man, Jones."
01:03:28;01:03:28;"- All right, so we decided that--"
01:03:28;01:03:29;"- Well the Jones were probably sitting"
01:03:29;01:03:31;"in the display case for 36 hours."
01:03:31;01:03:35;"- No, Jones is Mike Jones, it's Mike Jones."
01:03:35;01:03:36;"- Oh, it's not a first name?"
01:03:36;01:03:37;"- No."
01:03:37;01:03:38;"- Oh, it's Mike Jones."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"Okay, they're all forgiven."
01:03:39;01:03:42;"- 8-0-0-4, that's the phone number for Jones on third."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"- Was from Cantor's."
01:03:44;01:03:45;"- That makes sense to me,"
01:03:45;01:03:46;"'cause the one that's like, all right."
01:03:46;01:03:47;"- Yeah."
01:03:47;01:03:48;"- Okay, I wouldn't think that I would get--"
01:03:48;01:03:49;"- Cantor's is just all right."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"- An exceptional Lodka at Cantor's."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"The whole thing with Cantor's"
01:03:52;01:03:55;"is that it's a brand name Jewish deli."
01:03:55;01:03:57;"Like the first time I came to LA,"
01:03:57;01:03:58;"like the first Jewish deli we went to,"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"I think it's also 'cause it was open late at night."
01:04:00;01:04:01;"- Yeah."
01:04:01;01:04:02;"- And like Guns N' Roses back home out there."
01:04:02;01:04:02;"- Cantor's out there."
01:04:02;01:04:04;"- It's like, Cantor's is where you hang out,"
01:04:04;01:04:04;"it's not 'cause the food is good."
01:04:04;01:04:05;"- No, actually, I was there the first,"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"I don't know if it was the first time we went there,"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"so we, like, first, very first time we went to LA,"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"same trip we went to Fatburger."
01:04:11;01:04:13;"We go to Cantor's 'cause it's, you know, it's open late"
01:04:13;01:04:16;"and we're from New York, we know what deli food is, so."
01:04:16;01:04:17;"- They don't have keys to Cantor's."
01:04:17;01:04:18;"- Whoa, really?"
01:04:18;01:04:19;"- 'Cause it's never closed."
01:04:19;01:04:22;"There's never, it's never closed, there's no key."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"- Wow."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"- Or like a crazy dude told me that at Cantor's,"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"that might be some bull."
01:04:27;01:04:29;"- This was not our very first trip to,"
01:04:29;01:04:30;"no, it might have been, 'cause I think we were opening"
01:04:30;01:04:33;"for Madonna on the Like A Virgin tour."
01:04:33;01:04:34;"- Wow."
01:04:34;01:04:35;"- And we were standing in front of the pastry counter,"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"Cantor's, you know, like in the front there,"
01:04:37;01:04:40;"and who's there just talking indiscriminately"
01:04:40;01:04:41;"to people about Rodney Dangerfield."
01:04:41;01:04:42;"- Oh, wow."
01:04:42;01:04:43;"- That's amazing."
01:04:43;01:04:45;"- We, having grown up on Caddyshack."
01:04:45;01:04:46;"- Back to school."
01:04:46;01:04:46;"- Huge thing."
01:04:46;01:04:47;"- Days ahead."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"- And if you get down to it, guys,"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"I think the reality is--"
01:04:50;01:04:51;"- Easy money."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"- In terms of white rappers on record,"
01:04:53;01:04:56;"the only white rappers that had big records before us"
01:04:56;01:04:58;"were Rodney Dangerfield and Mel Brooks."
01:04:58;01:04:59;"- Oh, rapping Rodney."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"- Rapping Rodney."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"- Yeah, so I'm just saying, that's real."

01:09:32;01:09:34;"- You're tuned into the Chris Mica Show"

01:09:36;01:09:37;"- This is a holiday edition,"
01:09:37;01:09:40;"but I think 'cause it is year end too,"
01:09:40;01:09:43;"it's important, I wanted to do a round table,"
01:09:43;01:09:46;"just year end, quick reflection."
01:09:46;01:09:48;"I don't want too much thought to go into this."
01:09:48;01:09:50;"Favorite songs of the year."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"- I know mine, I think."
01:09:51;01:09:53;"- Wait, one song or?"
01:09:53;01:09:55;"- Oh no, I think we go one for one."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"Let's say five each, but we're gonna take turns."
01:09:57;01:09:58;"Like don't say all five."
01:09:58;01:09:59;"- Ooh, five."
01:09:59;01:10:02;"- Five each, that's a lot."
01:10:02;01:10:03;"- Five each."
01:10:03;01:10:06;"(laughing)"
01:10:06;01:10:07;"- Stop being greedy, Troye."
01:10:07;01:10:08;"- I got two cuts for you, that's it."
01:10:08;01:10:09;"Two cuts."
01:10:09;01:10:10;"- I got two cuts."
01:10:10;01:10:11;"- Two cuts."
01:10:11;01:10:13;"- All right, anywhere between two and five."
01:10:13;01:10:14;"- Five each, okay."
01:10:14;01:10:15;"Two cuts."
01:10:15;01:10:17;"- Two cuts, you got five cuts, that's okay."
01:10:17;01:10:20;"- You know, I do feel in this kind of crazy"
01:10:20;01:10:21;"hall of mirrors reality,"
01:10:21;01:10:24;"sometimes it's hard to remember what came out which year."
01:10:24;01:10:25;"Okay, I can think about,"
01:10:25;01:10:26;"I've been seeing some of the year end lists,"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"so I can think of all the albums"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"that I've been seeing up there."
01:10:30;01:10:32;"A lot of good albums."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"- A lot of superstars on that stage."
01:10:34;01:10:36;"A lot of big names in the game, you know what I'm saying?"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"- I mean, now, I can't,"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"it seems weird to pick a Kanye song"
01:10:40;01:10:41;"after that conversation."

01:10:42;01:10:43;"if there were albums,"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"I'd have to put Pablo as one of my top five."
01:10:45;01:10:46;"I think it would be,"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"well, definitely I think it would be a top 10 album."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"I think it would be a top five album pretty good."
01:10:50;01:10:51;"- Definitely."
01:10:51;01:10:55;"- Even as disconcerted as I was with the recent news."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"- Yeah, but like, I talk about this all the time."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"Why does it matter what someone's doing"
01:10:59;01:10:59;"in their personal life?"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"It has no bearing on their art."
01:11:01;01:11:02;"Separate, like--"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"- I guess, but--"
01:11:04;01:11:05;"- Well, you could make the case,"
01:11:05;01:11:06;"and I'm not saying--"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"- You can vote for whoever as person of the year,"

01:14:02;01:14:05;"and an agitator, we need both in our world."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"We need people who are making great art."
01:14:07;01:14:08;"We need people that are agitating"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"that are like getting the discussion going"
01:14:10;01:14:15;"and he does both and has done both so reliably for so long."
01:14:15;01:14:16;"- I think a lot of people feel like"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"he may be setting a new level now."
01:14:18;01:14:20;"(laughing)"
01:14:20;01:14:23;"- I just don't think one affects the other."
01:14:23;01:14:26;"- I kind of agree with your point,"
01:14:26;01:14:28;"but in this case, like it actually changed"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"my feeling somehow about Kanye."
01:14:30;01:14:31;"It was hard for me."
01:14:31;01:14:32;"I still don't know how I feel."
01:14:32;01:14:34;"It's kind of like when I saw Henry Rollins"
01:14:34;01:14:38;"on the Calvin Klein billboard by Lafayette and Houston."
01:14:38;01:14:40;"'Cause I grew up like a punk rock kid"
01:14:40;01:14:41;"and I loved Black Flag."
01:14:41;01:14:43;"- Right, I just saw that."
01:14:43;01:14:45;"- And so Henry Rollins were like holier than thou"
01:14:45;01:14:47;"and then to see him as a,"
01:14:47;01:14:48;"and that's like he's a grown man."
01:14:48;01:14:49;"It's his choice."
01:14:49;01:14:51;"He wants to be that, that."
01:14:51;01:14:53;"I'm, intellectually I'm fine with it,"
01:14:53;01:14:56;"but somehow in my gut it felt really weird."
01:14:56;01:14:58;"- Right, I think Kanye is a different thing"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"because it seems like, I can't even speculate."
01:15:00;01:15:04;"I'm just saying it seems like more medical,"
01:15:04;01:15:07;"I would say medical issues than choices."
01:15:07;01:15:09;"- My biggest takeaway is just that I felt like,"
01:15:09;01:15:12;"okay, it was one thing, I felt like we were"
01:15:12;01:15:15;"at this like Mike Judge point of where"
01:15:15;01:15:17;"America had become idiocracy,"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"but now we've gone beyond that where it's like"
01:15:19;01:15:22;"Matt and Trey Parker really are writing the script."
01:15:22;01:15:23;"It's really now South Park"
01:15:23;01:15:27;"because it's Kanye going from,"
01:15:27;01:15:30;"he was just recently committed to a mental,"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"he's on a forced psychiatric hold"
01:15:32;01:15:37;"and then he's visiting the president of the United States."
01:15:37;01:15:39;"This is a South Park episode, people."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"- Yeah, I mean, we have no idea what's going on."
01:15:41;01:15:42;"- Yeah, we don't, we can't speculate"
01:15:42;01:15:45;"on someone's personal life, but the point being is like,"
01:15:45;01:15:47;"did he even meet Trump?"
01:15:47;01:15:47;"We don't know."
01:15:47;01:15:50;"Have potatoes ever even existed at all?"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"- So you're saying it just existed on the Twitter?"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"- Or are latkes made of Skittles?"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"- All right, well, we are talking about top favorites"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"of the year."
01:15:58;01:15:59;"- ""Same Drugs"" by Chance."
01:15:59;01:16:01;"- I'm gonna air high five you,"
01:16:01;01:16:04;"'cause I was gonna pick ""Same Drugs"" by Chance the Rapper."
01:16:04;01:16:05;"- Really? - Really?"
01:16:05;01:16:06;"- That's cool that that was both the same song"
01:16:06;01:16:07;"'cause it's not like one of the--"
01:16:07;01:16:08;"- Well, 'cause there's other songs,"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"like the one with Lil Wayne on his album."
01:16:10;01:16:11;"- Yeah, and ""Smoke Breaks a Great Song."""
01:16:11;01:16:13;"- But for me, ""Same Drugs""-- - No problem."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"- ""Same Drugs"" is emotional to me."
01:16:14;01:16:16;"- No comment on my, I think it's emotional."
01:16:16;01:16:18;"I related to it and I don't feel like I,"
01:16:18;01:16:19;"I don't know, in terms of like,"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"it's a great relationship song."

01:18:36;01:18:37;"- That's interesting."
01:18:37;01:18:40;"I had a different interpretation of that song, in a way,"
01:18:40;01:18:43;"where it seems like where someone is,"
01:18:43;01:18:45;"like you grow up around getting drunk,"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"getting up, whatever,"
01:18:47;01:18:52;"and then someone gets really, really deep into drugs."

01:18:56;01:18:57;"You know what I mean?"
01:18:57;01:18:59;"I guess that's what I connected to."
01:18:59;01:19:00;"- Maybe it's a double entendre."
01:19:00;01:19:02;"- That's true, it could be both."
01:19:02;01:19:03;"- And I've lived through that too,"
01:19:03;01:19:06;"but I guess I really related it to just,"
01:19:06;01:19:07;"it's like-- - Where it's not just like"

01:20:15;01:20:17;"or was it 2015, ""Lil Yachty, Minnesota""?"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"- Oh yeah, I like that song a lot."
01:20:19;01:20:20;"- You turned me on to that song."
01:20:20;01:20:20;"- That's a great song."
01:20:20;01:20:22;"- So I don't know if I should credit you,"
01:20:22;01:20:23;"but I think that was 2016."
01:20:23;01:20:24;"- It might've been last year, I don't know."
01:20:24;01:20:26;"- Was it 2015 or 2016?"
01:20:26;01:20:27;"- It definitely, it's relevant to,"
01:20:27;01:20:28;"it was like people listened to it this year."
01:20:28;01:20:29;"- But I just feel like, I love,"

01:22:35;01:22:37;"I mean, I listened to a lot of music."
01:22:37;01:22:39;"You know, I think I've been working on an album this year,"
01:22:39;01:22:43;"so I started hearing things in different ways."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"I'm so focused on the music that I'm making,"
01:22:45;01:22:47;"that, I mean, I hear it and I respect it"

01:22:53;01:22:55;"it's just what's happening."

01:46:20;01:46:22;"in Watch the Throne."
01:46:22;01:46:23;"- Oh, it's just the song cuts out."
01:46:23;01:46:25;"- It just cuts out in the middle, it's just like,"
01:46:25;01:46:27;"mostly it's gonna be raw stuff."
01:46:27;01:46:29;"And then the beat drops back in."
01:46:29;01:46:30;"- Let the conversation begin."
01:46:30;01:46:32;"(laughing)"
01:46:32;01:46:35;"- The conversation, yeah."
01:46:35;01:46:37;"But why is it there's something with the voice,"
01:46:37;01:46:39;"it's the creepiest thing in the entire world."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"- Let the conversation--"
01:46:40;01:46:42;"- But he's not like super villain."
01:46:42;01:46:43;"- I really like that."
01:46:43;01:46:46;"(laughing)"
01:46:46;01:46:48;"- Mostly it's gonna be raw stuff."
01:46:48;01:46:50;"(laughing)"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"- It's like, Garth, what's up, homie?"
01:46:52;01:46:53;"- What are you doing?"
01:46:53;01:46:55;"- Garth's been getting in a lot of red tube."
01:46:55;01:46:57;"(laughing)"
01:46:57;01:46:58;"- Oh, man."
01:46:58;01:47:01;"Yeah, he like--"
01:47:01;01:47:02;"- Alone in his hotel room."
01:47:02;01:47:03;"- Slick stuff, for sure."
01:47:03;01:47:06;"(laughing)"
01:47:06;01:47:10;"- I got another of Garth Brooks' Gunna for me."
01:47:10;01:47:11;"That was not good."
01:47:11;01:47:13;"- Yo, man, tell him to bring it."
01:47:13;01:47:15;"- Shout out Garth, he's a legend, we love your music, man."
01:47:15;01:47:17;"- Yo, that's, no disrespect."
01:47:17;01:47:20;"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
01:47:20;01:47:23;"I said that's the most fire track this year, dude."
01:47:23;01:47:26;"- That's true, he did finish his whole episode out."
01:47:26;01:47:26;"- Thank you, Garth."
01:47:26;01:47:28;"- Holiday edition, all right."
01:47:28;01:47:30;"Christmas, Hanukkah, whatever."
01:47:30;01:47:31;"- Slick stuff."
01:47:31;01:47:32;"- Garth Brooks comes out on top, people."
01:47:32;01:47:34;"I mean, number one."
01:47:34;01:47:34;"- That's right."
01:47:34;01:47:35;"- Right there."
01:47:35;01:47:36;"- As always."
01:47:36;01:47:38;"- And with something, number one in 2016"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"was something that he probably didn't even release this year."
01:47:40;01:47:41;"- He really liked that."
01:47:41;01:47:43;"(laughing)"
01:47:44;01:47:47;"- Yo, Mike D, thank you for supporting Trump"
01:47:47;01:47:49;"always in your music since back in the day."
01:47:49;01:47:51;"I'm out since 1989."
01:47:51;01:47:53;"- All right, just to clarify."
01:47:53;01:47:55;"- Listen to Johnny Ryan, you can hear Mike D"
01:47:55;01:47:57;"support Trump early days, peace."
01:47:57;01:47:59;"- Paul's Boutique in the iTunes store, check it out."
01:47:59;01:48:03;"- Am I allowed to give you a compliment?"
01:48:03;01:48:05;"(laughing)"
01:48:05;01:48:10;"- After dragging me through the mud"
01:48:10;01:48:12;"as a supposed Trump supporter."
01:48:12;01:48:15;"- I was all a bit, and I love Paul's Boutique."
01:48:15;01:48:17;"- Classic, amazing album."
01:48:17;01:48:19;"- My second favorite Beastie Boys album."
01:48:19;01:48:20;"- Second favorite."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"- Can you guess my first?"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"- I mean, the obvious would be Licensed Ill,"
01:48:23;01:48:25;"but I'm gonna say no because A,"
01:48:25;01:48:26;"you would have been too young,"
01:48:26;01:48:27;"and B, that would be too obvious."
01:48:27;01:48:30;"- What video did Spike send you of me rapping?"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"- Oh wait, so What You Want, right?"
01:48:32;01:48:33;"No."
01:48:33;01:48:37;"- Professor Booty, off the album, Check Your Head."
01:48:37;01:48:38;"- Well, I was gonna say Check Your Head"
01:48:38;01:48:40;"was gonna be where I was gonna go."
01:48:40;01:48:41;"But that's the thing, I was gonna say"
01:48:41;01:48:44;"but that's also 'cause of the time of when"
01:48:44;01:48:47;"you were rapping, when you were skating,"
01:48:47;01:48:49;"it's like what it meant to you in time."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"- 1000%."
01:48:50;01:48:53;"- I might be more of a ill communication guy."
01:48:53;01:48:55;"- Okay."
01:48:55;01:48:56;"- I'm more of a Garth--"
01:48:56;01:48:59;"- But again, maybe, I feel like Princeton Record Exchange,"
01:48:59;01:49:01;"that could have been a time and place thing."
01:49:01;01:49:02;"- It looks like you're a little older."
01:49:02;01:49:06;"And also, to tie it all back, Q-Tip's on that album."
01:49:06;01:49:07;"- Yeah, true."
01:49:07;01:49:08;"- That's true."
01:49:08;01:49:10;"- Which Garth Brooks--"
01:49:10;01:49:11;"- And Donald Trump."
01:49:11;01:49:13;"- Which Beastie song would you have Garth Brooks feature"
01:49:13;01:49:15;"and which Vampire Weekend song"
01:49:15;01:49:16;"would you have Garth Brooks feature?"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"- Garth Brooks from the Facebook post?"
01:49:18;01:49:20;"- Yeah, just spoken word."
01:49:20;01:49:21;"- Okay, spoken word."
01:49:21;01:49:22;"- Break."
01:49:22;01:49:23;"- I feel like that would be good."
01:49:23;01:49:25;"I mean, it's so right for sampling."
01:49:25;01:49:26;"There's so many--"
01:49:26;01:49:27;"- Any song."
01:49:27;01:49:28;"- Yeah."
01:49:28;01:49:29;"- Please, any hip hop people."
01:49:29;01:49:31;"- The raw stuff, there's so much good."
01:49:31;01:49:32;"- I'm gonna put it on a song in the future."
01:49:32;01:49:34;"- Oh, dude, Ezra's making a record."
01:49:34;01:49:36;"He should put it in the middle, just go--"
01:49:36;01:49:38;"- I'm gonna personally be disappointed in you."
01:49:38;01:49:40;"- Why don't, in the middle of a song, just go,"
01:49:40;01:49:43;"no, you just go, but mostly it's gonna be raw stuff."
01:49:43;01:49:46;"- And then, and then, beat kicks in,"
01:49:46;01:49:48;"Grammy's, popping bottles."
01:49:48;01:49:49;"- And that's when your cover of Black Beatles"
01:49:49;01:49:51;"is gonna come on."
01:49:51;01:49:52;"- Black Beatles in the city."
01:49:52;01:49:56;"- All right, y'all, thank you so much."
01:49:56;01:49:58;"2016, it's a wrap."
01:49:58;01:50:01;"Special holiday edition, it's a wrap."
01:50:01;01:50:04;"I wanna thank Ezra Koetig."
01:50:04;01:50:06;"I wanna thank Jonah Hill joining us here."
01:50:06;01:50:08;"Special holiday special, we out."
01:50:08;01:50:09;"- Beats one."
01:50:09;01:50:10;"- Worldwide."
