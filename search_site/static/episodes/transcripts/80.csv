00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis, back again. Today Jake and I are joined in the studio by two very"
00:06;00:11;"special guests. Hannah Fidel, director of The Long Dumb Road, and Jason Manzoukas,"
00:11;00:16;"star of The Long Dumb Road. We'll also listen to the greatest hits of 1985 and"
00:16;00:24;"2018. Plus, talk about the Acebo. What is the Acebo? You already know. Figure it out."
00:24;00:37;"And if you don't know, you'll find out real soon. Because this is Time Crisis with Ezra King. Beats 1.1."
00:38;00:44;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:44;00:51;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the bus had to go"
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:10;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:16;01:20;"Leave it on me babe"
01:20;01:29;"Alright, Time Crisis back again. What's up Jake? Hey. This time it's not just the two of us. When was the last time we had, I guess we have in-studio guests fairly
frequently?"
01:29;01:37;"Kazzy David. Okay, yeah, that was a month or two ago. Yeah, not very frequently. A lot of Collins. A lot of Collins."
01:37;01:45;"But today we actually have some human beings in the studio because this is a special episode about The Long Dumb Road and we're here with director Hannah Fidel."
01:45;01:53;"Fidel. Fidel. Okay. Hannah Fidel. Jake just learned this like six months ago. I really thought- Not true."
01:53;02:07;"Hannah Fidel. Wait, say it again. Fidel. So it's not Fidel. No, that's it. It's Fidel? Yeah. Not Fidel? It should be spelled F-I-E-D-E-L-L."
02:07;02:19;"Hannah Fidel. Jake Longstreath. Jonathan. It's not Jonathan. Wait, wait, your birth name is just John? Yeah. It's not Jonathan? No. What? J-O-H-N."
02:19;02:27;"J-O-H-N is a different name than Jonathan? Yeah, I think so. Because you don't spell Jonathan with an H. Okay. This is good stuff."
02:27;02:35;"Really off to the races and rounding it out is the star of The Long Dumb Road, Jason Manzoukas. By the way, nailed it. How was that? Flawless."
02:35;02:43;"Absolutely flawless. That was impressive, actually. Now, growing up, Jason, did people get your name wrong a lot or is it actually easier?"
02:43;02:57;"All the time. Anytime growing up, anytime anybody read my name, it was always, ""Man, Koukousis, Mansa. There's just too many concurrent consonants in the name to
effortlessly get it."""
02:57;03:05;"I've had the experience, and my first name is less complicated than your last name, Jason, but now I think kind of most people know it. It's become a more popular baby
name."
03:05;03:14;"I also have memories of growing up and being in some situations where somebody would look at my name, E-Z-R-A, and I don't even think this is on any kind of cultural sh*t."
03:14;03:25;"I think it's just people who don't feel confident in their spelling or their reading abilities, and as soon as they would see that, even just with four letters, they
would go, ""Oh my God. I'm not going to get this one."""
03:25;03:31;"What? Easy rock. It's a thing. A lot of people would often read it as Urza. Yeah, I could see that."
03:31;03:44;"I can almost imagine that as simple as it seems, E-Z-R-A, I literally can only think of one way to pronounce it, Ezra, but I think some people, maybe their eyes go
straight to the Z-R, and they're just already like, ""Okay, I'm out."""
03:44;03:49;"Those don't go together. I'm out. So looking at your last name. T-Z. Yeah, it's the T-Z right in the middle."
03:49;03:53;"The T-Z is a real problem for people. It really hangs people up."
03:53;04:01;"Because maybe they're starting to sound it out, like, kind of grade school style, and they're just like, ""Jason Mant, Mantzuacus."""
04:01;04:05;"Yeah, exactly. Oh, then you got the O-U. Yeah, but you got a lot of Mantzuacus."
04:05;04:18;"Yeah, there's a lot of that. There's a lot of exactly what you just did, watching people try to work it out, and then there was a lot of people who'd be like, ""Jason Mant,
Jason M? Is Jason M here?"""
04:18;04:24;"So, Long Dumb Road. We talked about it once or twice on the show. It's come up. I think TC heads know that it's coming."
04:24;04:30;"Yeah. So this is the movie that Hannah directed Jason Starz in. Did you do anything on it, Jay? You do a little music?"
04:30;04:36;"Yeah, some rough score stuff. Dick pics, aka Richard Pictures, much to the consternation of Mantzuacus."
04:36;04:40;"I have real thoughts on this. Wait, wait, wait. We can get into it in a second. Real thoughts on this."
04:40;04:46;"We made up some rough score ideas, which ended up getting used. By the way, it's out November 9th."
04:46;04:49;"Why do you keep saying rough scoring? You're just being humble?"
04:49;04:53;"Yeah, he's being humble. The songs that he recorded, we used."
04:53;04:55;"So you did some scoring for the film?"
04:55;04:58;"To be fair, those songs are rough."
04:58;04:59;"Okay."
04:59;05:00;"Yeah, it's rough stuff, folks."
05:00;05:02;"It's a bit of a rough listen."
05:02;05:07;"Yeah, just when you keep saying rough, it keeps implying that then we handed it to the composer, who took some of the themes."
05:07;05:09;"That also happened."
05:09;05:10;"Okay."
05:10;05:14;"Being a little modest, they were also designed to be demos."
05:14;05:17;"And then sometimes the demo is better than the album."
05:17;05:18;"You guys did it as temp score."
05:18;05:19;"Right."
05:19;05:22;"And then we realized it was really good."
05:22;05:23;"That's cool."
05:23;05:24;"Real peak behind the scenes here."
05:24;05:25;"Keep something vibing."
05:54;05:58;"So you guys just premiered the movie at South by Southwest?"
05:58;06:01;"No, we premiered it at Sundance."
06:01;06:03;"But you were in Austin."
06:03;06:04;"In Austin, yes."
06:04;06:06;"At the Austin Film Festival."
06:06;06:08;"Is it even South by Southwest time of year?"
06:08;06:09;"It is not."
06:09;06:10;"Oh yeah, that's like in March."
06:10;06:11;"Come on, man. You know that."
06:11;06:12;"Correct."
06:12;06:16;"I saw that you guys were doing movie stuff in Austin, and I made an assumption."
06:16;06:18;"I think that's totally appropriate."
06:18;06:21;"And in Austin, did you guys go to Pluckers?"
06:21;06:22;"No."
06:22;06:23;"I didn't."
06:23;06:24;"Oh, I didn't."
06:24;06:25;"Did you guys?"
06:25;06:26;"We did not."
06:26;06:27;"No."
06:27;06:28;"What's Pluckers?"
06:28;06:29;"Pluckers?"
06:29;06:32;"It's either a food establishment or like a bluegrass club."
06:32;06:34;"It's food establishment."
06:34;06:36;"What do you think the vibe of Pluckers is?"
06:36;06:37;"It's based in Austin."
06:37;06:40;"I'm going to say it's like a--I'm going to guess a chicken joint of some sort."
06:40;06:42;"There's so many types of chicken, though."
06:42;06:46;"Oh, probably just a clean grilled chicken breast."
06:46;06:47;"[laughs]"
06:47;06:52;"Like something very lightly seasoned with like a little bit of olive oil and some thyme."
06:52;06:53;"I'm guessing."
06:53;06:56;"Like something that's three Weight Watchers points."
06:56;07:00;"Well, Austin should clarify that Pluckers is a chain of about 30 restaurants in Texas."
07:00;07:02;"Okay, then I'm doubling down."
07:02;07:09;"It's just lightly--and maybe there's just like a little bit of an arugula salad on the side."
07:09;07:10;"That's my guess."
07:10;07:13;"Are you ready to get plucked at Pluckers?"
07:13;07:19;"I'll have one lightly salted chicken breast with some thyme, some oregano,"
07:19;07:22;"something that is very locale."
07:22;07:26;"This is actually a pretty good idea because when you talk about chicken restaurants,"
07:26;07:31;"you're thinking of barbecue chicken, fried chicken, or what Pluckers actually is, wangs, buffalo wangs."
07:31;07:33;"Chicken [bleep]"
07:33;07:34;"Yeah, exactly."
07:34;07:35;"Oh."
07:35;07:36;"You also go watch the game there."
07:36;07:37;"Oh, cool."
07:37;07:38;"So it's a game spot?"
07:38;07:39;"Yeah, you watch the game."
07:39;07:40;"Is it a game spot?"
07:40;07:42;"Is it inside of a game spot where they sell video games?"
07:42;07:45;"It might occasionally be next to one in a strip mall."
07:45;07:46;"Oh, Pluckers is a strip mall?"
07:46;07:49;"Wait a minute, is Pluckers a local Austin only?"
07:49;07:53;"Are you asking did we go to the Pluckers in Austin, but if we had been in Cincinnati,"
07:53;07:55;"would you have also said, ""Hey, did you go to Pluckers?"""
07:55;07:56;"Houston, San Antonio."
07:56;07:58;"Pluckers is an Austin-based--"
07:58;07:59;"Texas."
07:59;08:01;"Texas/Oklahoma."
08:01;08:02;"I think Louisiana."
08:02;08:07;"And Louisiana buffalo wangs chain, and I believe in Austin there's probably a few."
08:07;08:08;"Got it."
08:08;08:11;"I thought I saw on Instagram that you guys went to Pluckers or something."
08:11;08:12;"Are you just shouting out Pluckers?"
08:12;08:17;"I listened to the episode where you talk to the dude who does all the social media."
08:17;08:18;"The social media guy, yeah."
08:18;08:22;"You have a relationship with the Pluckers social media guy?"
08:22;08:23;"Yes, he was our--"
08:23;08:25;"We were on the phone with him for 40 minutes."
08:25;08:26;"He was our guest on the last show."
08:26;08:28;"I have to say one of your best guests."
08:28;08:29;"He was interesting."
08:29;08:34;"He was real mask off with us because we always talk about corporate food Twitter and how"
08:34;08:38;"much it offends us, but he got on here and he was like, ""Listen, I'm creating buffalo"
08:38;08:42;"wang memes, I'm picking fights with buffalo wild wings on Twitter."
08:42;08:44;"I used to be a journalist."
08:44;08:46;"Now I run social media for Pluckers."""
08:46;08:48;"And this is the world we-- what did he keep saying?"
08:48;08:50;"It's a dumb time to be alive."
08:50;08:51;"It's a dumb time to be alive."
08:51;08:52;"Wow."
08:52;08:53;"Which is a good time with the film."
08:53;08:54;"Wow."
08:54;08:55;"It's a dumb time to be alive."
08:55;08:57;"He is the social media coordinator for Pluckers."
08:57;08:58;"Yeah."
08:58;08:59;"Former journalist."
08:59;09:02;"That right there is heartbreak for journalists everywhere."
09:02;09:03;"Yeah."
09:03;09:04;"No, but he even said something--"
09:04;09:05;"That sums it up."
09:05;09:06;"He even said something on the last episode."
09:06;09:08;"It was really raw the way he put it."
09:08;09:13;"He said something like, ""I mean, you could spend weeks researching an article about racism"
09:13;09:15;"at UT, nobody's going to read it."""
09:15;09:19;"Or you can make a crying Jordan buffalo wang, get a thousand retweets."
09:19;09:20;"He said something like that."
09:20;09:21;"Yeah."
09:21;09:22;"Yeah, so he was real mask off."
09:22;09:24;"He was letting us behind the scenes and we appreciate that."
09:24;09:26;"Traditionally, is he a mask on kind of guy though?"
09:26;09:27;"Well, I guess--"
09:27;09:29;"Is he in Slipknot?"
09:29;09:31;"That's my question."
09:31;09:32;"Second career."
09:32;09:39;"He's like, ""I was a rhythm guitarist in Slipknot, journalist, and now I run social media for Pluckers."""
09:39;09:42;"I could imagine myself following that career trajectory myself."
09:42;09:43;"Yeah."
09:43;09:49;"I would love it if you were revealed to have been one of the members of Slipknot this whole time, just under a mask."
09:49;09:50;"That's actually a good--"
09:50;09:51;"Wow."
09:51;09:56;"When the next Vampire Weekend album comes out and people are asking what I've been doing for five and a half years,"
09:56;09:57;"I say, ""I've been out there playing music."""
09:57;09:58;"Yeah, exactly."
09:58;09:59;"Been touring with my band."
09:59;10:00;"Yeah."
10:00;10:02;"Oh, wait, but Vampire Weekend hasn't been on tour."
10:02;10:05;"Oh, I'm in my primary band, Slipknot."
10:05;10:07;"Oh, you're in-- Oh, wow."
10:07;10:08;"Oh, yeah, Vampire Weekend's a side project."
10:08;10:09;"Yeah."
10:10;10:12;"I heard Ezra plays in Slipknot."
10:12;10:14;"No, I think it's Gwar."
10:14;10:18;"I think he might be one of those big giants in Gwar."
10:18;10:19;"Mask on."
10:38;10:39;"Give it to three."
11:08;11:10;"And the movie's about to be out nationwide?"
11:10;11:11;"Yeah."
11:11;11:12;"November what?"
11:12;11:13;"16th?"
11:13;11:15;"November 9th in New York."
11:15;11:16;"November 9th."
11:16;11:17;"Yeah."
11:17;11:19;"And then November 16th everywhere else."
11:19;11:24;"So if you are in New York on November 9th, go to the goddamn theater and see this goddamn movie."
11:24;11:25;"That's right."
11:25;11:27;"Or I swear to God, I will punch you in the face."
11:27;11:29;"You heard it here first, folks."
11:29;11:30;"Yep."
11:30;11:31;"Kaboom."
11:31;11:33;"Do you guys want to explain-- Because we've referenced the movie--"
11:33;11:34;"I'd love to perform a scene from it."
11:34;11:35;"But we've never--"
11:35;11:36;"[laughter]"
11:36;11:40;"How come-- You know what's hilarious?"
11:40;11:45;"It's like when you're in a band, almost everything you get asked to do is like come to the radio station--"
11:45;11:46;"Yeah, play a song."
11:46;11:47;"--and do a version of the song."
11:47;11:49;"How come they don't ask actors to perform--"
11:49;11:52;"By the way, I would love to perform a scene from the movie."
11:52;11:57;"So before you explain what the movie's about live, here's Jason."
11:57;11:58;"Give us a taste of the movie."
11:58;12:00;"We're not going to go to a clip."
12:00;12:01;"We've got somebody, an actor live in the studio."
12:01;12:02;"Okay."
12:02;12:03;"Okay, here we go."
12:03;12:08;"I'm going to pretend, if you will, that I'm in a car, a minivan with Tony Revolori."
12:08;12:10;"Hey, man, you party?"
12:10;12:12;"Uh, yeah."
12:12;12:14;"Oh, funny, yeah."
12:14;12:16;"Yeah, I know, me too."
12:16;12:18;"Oh, yeah, you want to help me spark this up?"
12:18;12:20;"Uh-huh."
12:20;12:21;"Yeah."
12:21;12:22;"Oh, sure, I want to hear about it."
12:22;12:23;"Go ahead."
12:23;12:24;"Long story?"
12:24;12:25;"I don't mind."
12:25;12:26;"I have time."
12:26;12:27;"Yeah, start it up."
12:27;12:28;"Mm-hmm."
12:28;12:29;"Yep."
12:29;12:30;"Sure."
12:30;12:33;"Uh, I think it's short for Catherine."
12:33;12:34;"Uh-huh."
12:35;12:39;"You mind if I put something-- oh, yep."
12:39;12:40;"Okay."
12:40;12:42;"Yeah, no, take it."
12:42;12:43;"No, it's your mom."
12:43;12:44;"You should take it."
12:44;12:45;"Uh-huh."
12:45;12:46;"Uh, okay."
12:46;12:47;"Huh?"
12:47;12:48;"Oh, yeah, no."
12:48;12:50;"Yeah, I know, I wasn't listening."
12:50;12:53;"Yeah, sounds like your mom's a real trip."
12:53;12:54;"Uh-huh."
12:54;12:55;"Cool."
12:55;12:56;"Crying?"
12:56;12:57;"Why?"
12:57;12:58;"Oh, 'cause-- oh, 'cause you're her only child."
12:58;12:59;"So, oh, she's upset, I guess."
12:59;13:00;"Wow, okay."
13:00;13:01;"Yeah."
13:01;13:02;"You want to put some music on?"
13:02;13:03;"Yeah."
13:03;13:04;"Great, let's do it."
13:04;13:05;"What do you think?"
13:05;13:06;"Uh, Aerosmith?"
13:06;13:07;"Oh, no."
13:07;13:08;"Probably, uh, Slipknot?"
13:08;13:11;"Yeah, we should probably play some Slipknot."
13:11;13:13;"That's a little bit of ""Long Dumb Road"" right there."
13:13;13:14;"Very nice."
13:14;13:16;"I mean, like, that is almost word for word."
13:16;13:19;"I mean, obviously, it makes a lot more sense when Tony--"
13:19;13:20;"when you get Tony's lines."
13:20;13:22;"That's one of the scenes I have the least lines in."
13:22;13:23;"Mm-hmm."
13:23;13:24;"That's a very heavy Tony scene."
13:24;13:26;"Uh, but it's such a good scene,"
13:26;13:28;"I wanted people to get a taste of it."
13:28;13:29;"Yeah."
13:29;13:30;"Even if it's not the taste, I guess--"
13:30;13:32;"You know, you could have chose one where you got to show off."
13:32;13:33;"Sure."
13:33;13:34;"But you let the other actor shine."
13:34;13:35;"Yes."
13:35;13:36;"So generous."
13:36;13:37;"It's very generous."
13:37;13:38;"That's exactly it, 'cause I'm gonna be honest with you."
13:38;13:42;"Tony Revolori, uh, he's the bellhop from Grand Budapest Hotel."
13:42;13:45;"He's Flash Thompson in, uh, the ""Spider-Man"" homecoming movie."
13:45;13:48;"He's a fantastic actor, and I really wanted the audience--"
13:48;13:49;"I'm here."
13:49;13:50;"You're getting to hear me."
13:50;13:53;"I wanted them to get a sense of what he's bringing to the picture."
13:53;13:54;"That's true."
13:54;13:55;"I call movies pictures."
13:55;13:56;"Don't worry about it."
13:56;13:57;"[laughs]"
13:57;13:58;"Love it."
13:58;14:00;"Okay, now, Jason--"
14:00;14:01;"Ezra."
14:01;14:02;"You seem to be--"
14:02;14:03;"Or Urza."
14:03;14:05;"You seem to be reacting very negatively."
14:05;14:07;"If I'm reading between the lines correctly,"
14:07;14:09;"when Jake was talking about doing music for the movie,"
14:09;14:12;"and you referred to how Dick Picks, his Grateful Dead cover man--"
14:12;14:13;"Oh, yes."
14:13;14:14;"--is now known as Richard Pictures--"
14:14;14:15;"I don't like it."
14:15;14:16;"--for at least a couple years."
14:16;14:17;"I don't like it."
14:17;14:18;"You don't like the name change."
14:18;14:22;"If I'm not mistaken, that is a term that exists"
14:22;14:24;"within the Grateful Dead community"
14:24;14:29;"that has nothing to do with salacious pictures of one's genitalia, correct?"
14:29;14:30;"Dick's Picks."
14:32;14:34;"The genius of the name was the pun."
14:34;14:35;"Correct."
14:35;14:39;"So to me, that is in and of itself a great name for a band"
14:39;14:43;"because you're playing on two different things, which is great."
14:43;14:45;"It's specific to the Dead community,"
14:45;14:50;"but also a little bit of a ribald joke, which I don't mind."
14:50;14:53;"So because we know how we got there, you're okay with it?"
14:53;14:56;"I'm 100%-- I'm not only okay with it, I think it's really good."
14:56;14:58;"To call it Richard's Pictures--"
14:58;14:59;"Richard Pictures."
14:59;15:06;"Richard Pictures adds obfuscation that eliminates at least one of the jokes."
15:06;15:08;"Jason, I'm in full agreement with you."
15:08;15:09;"Yeah, thank you."
15:09;15:12;"But the name hit some roadblocks publicly."
15:12;15:13;"Got it."
15:13;15:15;"We played some school fundraisers, and that makes sense."
15:15;15:19;"You've got to change the name for a school fundraiser."
15:19;15:21;"Well, how old-- like, what school?"
15:21;15:22;"Grade school."
15:22;15:24;"Grade school, okay, I understand that."
15:24;15:26;"Maybe don't call a band Dick Picks."
15:26;15:28;"And then we played some shows with Vampire Weekend."
15:28;15:30;"I just want to finish the thought real fast."
15:30;15:33;"Would you have had us open for you if we were called Dick Picks?"
15:33;15:34;"Oh, wow."
15:34;15:36;"I'm really glad I didn't have to make that decision, actually."
15:36;15:37;"Yeah, who knows?"
15:37;15:39;"Maybe we got some blowback."
15:39;15:41;"After Trump got elected, we got some blowback from--"
15:41;15:42;"Wait a minute."
15:42;15:43;"What are you saying right now?"
15:43;15:44;"I'm literally saying--"
15:44;15:48;"You're saying Trump got elected?"
15:48;15:52;"I, to be fair, have not been reading the news."
15:52;15:55;"President Hillary Clinton."
15:55;15:59;"Okay, yes, after Trump got elected, we got some blowback."
15:59;16:01;"Everyone kind of lost their mind."
16:01;16:04;"We got some blowback from some peers and friends."
16:04;16:07;"That you considered to be valid?"
16:07;16:08;"I struggled with it."
16:08;16:11;"And then I was just like, you know what, I'm not going to--"
16:11;16:12;"am I going to die on this hill?"
16:12;16:15;"But are we going to, like, kowtow to people who are, like,"
16:15;16:20;"going to say, like, I don't like the clever pun you've made"
16:20;16:23;"on the Grateful Dead Dick's Picks thing?"
16:23;16:24;"I don't know."
16:24;16:25;"It's a tough one, man."
16:25;16:28;"A cover band's name certainly could go too far."
16:28;16:29;"I guess."
16:29;16:31;"Can't think of any off the top of my head."
16:31;16:34;"It's honestly something I've struggled with these last few years."
16:34;16:37;"Okay, but Seinfeld, you'll know the answer to this."
16:37;16:38;"Can you get on the mic for a second?"
16:38;16:44;"Wasn't there a viral tweet where somebody wrote ""you"" using the ""you"""
16:44;16:46;"and then ""me"" in intellectual format?"
16:46;16:51;"For people who don't know, it's a Twitter format where you say"
16:51;16:53;"this is the simple thing that you would say,"
16:53;16:57;"and then you write ""me,"" an intellectual colon,"
16:57;17:00;"and then you say the more elevated thing that ""me,"" the intellectual, would say."
17:00;17:04;"So somebody wrote ""you, Dick Picks, me,"" in intellectual Richard Pictures."
17:04;17:06;"This is a big viral tweet."
17:06;17:07;"That's right."
17:07;17:08;"I mean, this thing was massive."
17:08;17:09;"I saw that too."
17:09;17:10;"How many retweets?"
17:10;17:11;"100,000."
17:11;17:12;"Wow."
17:12;17:15;"If I don't ask him to do a number crunch, he'll just pull some--"
17:15;17:17;"that's why I always got to ask him to do a number crunch."
17:17;17:18;"He just pulled that one out of his ass."
17:18;17:19;"38,000 retweets."
17:19;17:20;"That's major."
17:20;17:23;"175,461 likes."
17:23;17:25;"Okay, so anyway, my question is,"
17:25;17:32;"did Dick Picks the band invent the phrase ""Richard Pictures""?"
17:32;17:33;"As far as I know."
17:33;17:36;"Did this person come up with it independently?"
17:36;17:38;"I'm sure there's parallel thinking."
17:38;17:39;"You can get there."
17:39;17:40;"Yeah."
17:40;17:41;"Perhaps."
17:41;17:45;"Had you guys ever heard somebody refer to Dick Picks as Richard Pictures before?"
17:45;17:48;"No, we were playing an elementary school fundraiser in Silver Lake,"
17:48;17:51;"and we were like, ""We're not going to roll in as Dick Picks."""
17:51;17:55;"But you were interestingly hired as Dick Picks."
17:55;17:57;"True."
17:57;17:58;"A friend of ours was on--"
17:58;17:59;"So you know what?"
17:59;18:01;"At that point, this is on them."
18:01;18:04;"They hired a band called Dick Picks to play at an elementary school."
18:04;18:05;"Here's the thing."
18:05;18:13;"I mean, I would understand if you guys were projecting Dick Picks on a screen during your show."
18:13;18:15;"I would be like, ""That might be too much."""
18:15;18:18;"That might be like leaning in on the crass--"
18:18;18:20;"Right, like punk rock."
18:20;18:22;"Yeah, like the kind of--"
18:22;18:24;"And also, that wouldn't have a lot to do with the ethos of the Grateful Dead."
18:24;18:25;"Exactly."
18:25;18:26;"Whose music you're--"
18:26;18:28;"But being that you're not, I don't know."
18:28;18:33;"I'm also like, ""You know what? Come on. The band is Dick Picks. What is this?"""
18:33;18:34;"They'll always be Dick Picks to you."
18:34;18:36;"Always, until the day I die."
18:36;18:40;"Within the band, we refer to ourselves as Picks or Dick Picks."
18:40;18:41;"Oh, we got a Dick Picks show coming up."
18:41;18:43;"We don't call ourselves Richard Pictures."
18:43;18:45;"Well, Hannah, you want to weigh in on this?"
18:45;18:47;"Because when did you and Jake get married?"
18:47;18:48;"A year ago."
18:48;18:51;"So when you guys got married, was the band called Dick Picks or Richard Pictures?"
18:51;18:52;"Dick Picks."
18:52;18:53;"No, Pictures."
18:53;18:54;"Oh, yeah."
18:54;18:55;"I guess-- Was it?"
18:55;18:56;"Well, here's the thing."
18:56;18:57;"In our household--"
18:57;18:59;"Okay, but you were dating when the band was called Dick Picks."
18:59;19:00;"Yes."
19:00;19:04;"So you've been with Jake as a member of Dick Picks, as a member of Richard Pictures."
19:04;19:05;"You've kind of seen it all."
19:05;19:06;"I've seen it all."
19:06;19:09;"But in our house, it is still Dick Picks."
19:09;19:12;"Did you have any kind of point of view about the name change?"
19:12;19:15;"I thought in this instance it was really silly."
19:15;19:16;"To change the name?"
19:16;19:19;"Yeah. I thought it was unnecessary."
19:19;19:22;"And I want to go on record and say, if you're playing in elementary school, of course,"
19:22;19:26;"I don't mind obfuscating a potentially insane name like that."
19:26;19:28;"But what about opening for Vampire Weekend?"
19:28;19:30;"That I have no problem with."
19:30;19:33;"That band should be able to handle it because they are--"
19:33;19:36;"I mean, at least one of the members of that band is in Slipknot."
19:36;19:37;"Keep that in mind."
19:37;19:39;"I'm not sure we would have got the gig."
19:39;19:40;"This is crazy, man."
19:40;19:41;"I never even thought about this."
19:41;19:44;"That would have been real tough for me, I wonder."
19:44;19:46;"Because you couldn't come out afterwards and be like, ""Come on, guys."
19:46;19:47;"Keep it going for Dick Picks."""
19:47;19:49;"Well, why can't you guys have two names?"
19:49;19:50;"We basically do."
19:50;19:51;"Right."
19:51;19:54;"Dick Picks colon Richard's Pictures?"
19:54;19:55;"If I--"
19:55;19:56;"[laughter]"
19:56;19:57;"They're both good names."
19:57;19:58;"I'm not worried about a colon."
19:58;20:05;"When I post on Instagram about our shows, I just say, ""We are playing a show November 4th."""
20:05;20:06;"That's not helping you, though."
20:06;20:07;"And then I say--"
20:07;20:09;"That's not helping you to be like ""we,"" to be a ""we."""
20:09;20:11;"And then I say, ""#DickPicksBand."""
20:11;20:12;"Interesting."
20:12;20:13;"Is it--"
20:13;20:15;"All of this is about a Grateful Dead cover band."
20:15;20:16;"Here's what I'm going to-- spell it."
20:16;20:18;"How do you spell it?"
20:18;20:22;"D-I-C-K space P-I-C-S."
20:22;20:24;"Change the spelling to D-I-C."
20:24;20:25;"Ugh, no."
20:25;20:26;"D-I-C-D-I-C."
20:26;20:28;"Like Bic."
20:28;20:29;"Dick Pick."
20:29;20:30;"D-I-C-P-I-C."
20:30;20:31;"I don't like it."
20:31;20:32;"No?"
20:32;20:33;"You think that's worse?"
20:33;20:34;"Yeah."
20:34;20:38;"But also Dick Latvala, who was the curator for Dick Picks, spelled it D-I-C-K."
20:38;20:39;"Sure."
20:39;20:40;"So we need to have that resonance."
20:40;20:41;"What if you--"
20:41;20:44;"But you're currently calling it Richard's Pictures."
20:44;20:45;"Richard Pictures, sir."
20:45;20:46;"Apologies, apologies."
20:46;20:50;"What if you split the difference and called it Dickard Pictures?"
20:50;20:51;"Hmm."
20:51;20:54;"How about Deckard's Pictures and it's a Blade Runner band?"
20:54;20:55;"That could be cool."
20:55;20:58;"Instead of Grateful Dead, it's all Tangerine Dream."
20:58;21:01;"By the way, I'm into this band."
21:01;21:03;"Well, yeah, I mean, not that outlandish."
21:04;21:07;"[theme music]"
21:48;21:49;"You haven't answered the question."
21:49;21:51;"Would I still have had the band?"
21:51;21:58;"Dick Picks. Vampire Weekend returns with their first shows in five years, or whatever it is, three years."
21:58;22:03;"Two intimate shows in Ojai. Opening for the band Dick Picks."
22:03;22:10;"I still would have had you open. I mean, but the truth is I never thought twice about it because I was very familiar with the reference."
22:10;22:16;"So if you hadn't told me that some people were uncomfortable with the name, I may have just assumed you guys are Grateful Dead band."
22:16;22:28;"Most people you play to are Grateful Dead fans, for whom the phrase Dick Picks in this context would immediately conjure up Dick's Picks before it conjured up images of
unwanted s***."
22:28;22:33;"You know what? If you had to change the name to something just like bad, Richard Pictures is a great name too."
22:33;22:41;"If you had come to me and said, ""I have a band called Richard Pictures,"" I'd be like, ""Okay, it's not as good as Dick Picks, but it's certainly a fine name for a band."""
22:41;22:42;"That's a pretty good name."
22:42;22:45;"And you wouldn't also make the connection that it's a Grateful Dead cover band."
22:45;22:47;"It wouldn't at all occur to me."
22:47;22:49;"No. Dick Picks, you're like, ""Okay, Dick Picks."""
22:49;22:56;"Some portion of the population who knows the dead, that is going to be the first connection they make."
22:56;23:00;"And then some people are going to be like, you know, ""Picture in the s***."""
23:00;23:04;"We just got booked for next April to Ventura County Fairgrounds."
23:04;23:05;"Really?"
23:05;23:08;"There's a three-day Grateful Dead cover band pop festival."
23:08;23:09;"What? This is amazing."
23:09;23:11;"We got a hot slot."
23:11;23:14;"Hot slot? By the way, can't use that for a band name."
23:14;23:18;"Under your guys' logic, you couldn't use the name."
23:18;23:21;"You shouldn't be using the words ""hot slot."""
23:21;23:22;"Yeah."
23:22;23:23;"Right? Can't say it."
23:23;23:24;"It's a hot s*** cover band."
23:24;23:26;"Can't say ""hot slot."""
23:26;23:28;"Next up, hot slot."
23:28;23:31;"We got a prime slot. Slot's just a terrible word."
23:31;23:34;"We got a prime billing."
23:34;23:35;"Check this."
23:35;23:36;"Yeah."
23:36;23:42;"The opening afternoon of the festival, Friday afternoon at 3 p.m., hour-long set."
23:42;23:43;"Boom."
23:43;23:45;"So you're kicking things off."
23:45;23:51;"We're just like, ""The vendors are setting up folding tables in those weird pop-up tents."""
23:51;23:54;"And we're just like, going into Jack Straw."
24:00;24:07;"We can share the women, we can share the wine."
24:07;24:19;"We can share what we got of yours 'cause we don't share all of mine."
24:19;24:26;"Keep on rolling, just a mile to go."
24:26;24:38;"Keep on rolling, my old buddy, you're moving much too slow."
24:38;24:44;"I just jumped the watchman right outside the fence."
24:44;24:50;"Took his dream small box and changed, made that heaven seem."
24:50;24:56;"Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, it burns my eyes to see."
24:56;25:04;"Cut down a man in Corvallis, Shannon, bodies will be free."
25:04;25:10;"Do you think at a Grateful Dead cover band festival, it's good vibes, as one would hope?"
25:10;25:14;"Or do you think you get a few people eyeing each other, just being like, ""Jerry wouldn't have done that."""
25:14;25:17;"Oh, I'm sure. There's gotta be fights."
25:17;25:22;"I went and saw Phil Lesch and Friends last week."
25:22;25:23;"Yikes."
25:23;25:27;"As part of the Outlaw Music Festival. It was a straight up yikes."
25:27;25:32;"Although, I will say, Sturgill Simpson was fantastic, as was Willie Nelson."
25:32;25:35;"But Phil Lesch and Friends, very disappointing."
25:35;25:42;"But you could tell there was a sense of anger amongst my friends who were the dead fans"
25:42;25:48;"about what the two guys that were singing, one guy singing the Bob songs, one guy singing the Jerry songs,"
25:48;25:51;"blah, blah, blah, and they were already getting into it."
25:51;25:56;"I was like, ""This must just be, I can't even imagine it, an entire festival."""
25:56;26:04;"I would love nothing more than if this Grateful Dead tribute band festival ended in an absolute riot."
26:04;26:05;"Like a full melee."
26:05;26:09;"This is the ugly truth, is that most hippies are not chill."
26:09;26:15;"Yeah. And the name of the subtitle, Ezra looked it up, the subtitle of the festival is Altamont 2?"
26:15;26:18;"That seems like it's asking for trouble."
26:18;26:19;"Bad vibes, man."
26:19;26:20;"Not good."
26:20;26:21;"I was actually like--"
26:21;26:24;"Oh yeah, Jerry's cameo in Altamont is amazing."
26:24;26:26;"Or in Gimme Shelter."
26:26;26:27;"Oh yeah."
26:27;26:29;"He's like, ""Oh, that's a bummer, man."""
26:29;26:31;"He's got one line in the whole talk."
26:31;26:36;"I heard he had more lines, but he got cut out a lot because his readings were not very good."
26:36;26:40;"I was watching some recent Phish videos."
26:40;26:42;"I was kind of curious, watching some Phish live."
26:42;26:43;"As you do."
26:43;26:46;"As one does, late night, getting ready for bed."
26:46;26:47;"Are you a Phish fan?"
26:47;26:51;"Growing up, I was never a Phish fan, but as I've gotten older, I've become more interested in Phish."
26:51;26:58;"And I was struck by, you know, like Phish is the epitome of just like really good musicians just having fun."
26:58;27:06;"And the fans are open-minded and they do kind of like--they'll do like little musical jokes, jump on trampolines,"
27:06;27:10;"historically do goofy covers, have fun."
27:10;27:12;"The drummer plays a vacuum cleaner."
27:12;27:13;"Yeah, they'll do stuff like that."
27:13;27:19;"And, you know, it's like hating on Phish is just kind of absurd because, you know, they're just having fun."
27:19;27:20;"Right."
27:20;27:26;"And then there's like a handful of commenters were irate at how Trey's tone had changed on this tour."
27:26;27:30;"They were just like, ""Trey's tone f---ing sucks. I mean, I'm a huge Phish fan."""
27:30;27:34;"And a few people were like, ""Yo, chill."" But it's like they were so angry about Trey's tone."
27:34;27:36;"I was like, ""Damn, even in the Phishhead community?"""
27:36;27:39;"Emotionally invested in that aesthetic, man."
27:39;27:41;"This is like Dylan going electric."
27:41;27:42;"Yeah."
27:42;27:43;"Trey's tone--"
27:43;27:44;"Trey's tone slightly changed."
27:44;27:47;"Like, oh, man, bouncing around the room never sounded the same."
27:47;27:49;"He boosted some mids, and I was done."

29:07;29:10;"So speaking of Dylan, we got a lot to talk about."
29:10;29:16;"On my Instagram account, I've been sharing some interest in a certain type of font family."
29:16;29:18;"Probably some TC heads have seen this."
29:18;29:20;"Is that what you call your fans? TC heads?"
29:20;29:21;"The fans of Time Crisis."
29:21;29:27;"Are you getting any kind of conflicting fan base with the character TC from Magnum P.I.?"
29:27;29:28;"Not familiar."
29:28;29:32;"'Cause I'm a member, I'm a TC head. I am a TC head."
29:32;29:33;"Of the original TC heads."
29:33;29:39;"I am a TC head, meaning TC, the helicopter pilot character from the Magnum P.I. series and the reboot."
29:39;29:43;"The drummer of Vampire Weekend is named CT, Chris Thompson."
29:43;29:50;"And we once had a bus driver who CT kind of had a good rapport with."
29:50;29:55;"And they would chat about, you know, the drive and maybe they'd talk about sports or something."
29:55;29:56;"That's a good rapport?"
29:56;29:57;"They had a pretty good rapport."
29:57;30:01;"That's, in your mind, a good rapport is talking about the drive or sports?"
30:01;30:05;"Well, I don't talk about sports or drive, so I feel alienated from it."
30:05;30:11;"But I just remember Chris telling us that at some point, like, they'd been building this bond for weeks or something."
30:11;30:14;"And maybe-- I'm probably amping this up too much."
30:14;30:19;"But then at the end of the tour or something, like, Chris was like, ""You know, it's been really great getting to know you, Gary,"" or whatever."
30:19;30:21;"And then he said like, ""All right, you too, TC."""
30:21;30:23;"[laughter]"
30:23;30:28;"""Yeah, all right. Yeah, you too, TC. Have a good one, man."""
30:28;30:29;"I've had that experience, too."
30:29;30:33;"I once had a very long conversation with someone like I vaguely knew."
30:33;30:38;"And then at the end of the-- and, you know, like really just talking about life and [bleep] and they called me Elijah."
30:38;30:40;"But I was like with it."
30:40;30:42;"I never get mad about that."
30:42;30:46;"Yeah, I feel like if somebody-- people are allowed to make that mistake."
30:46;30:52;"If somebody treats you with respect and then they confidently say the wrong name, who cares?"
30:52;30:53;"Yeah."
30:53;30:57;"Except for the fact that you've been disrespected because your name is all you have."
30:57;31:01;"It represents-- it literally is all you are is your name."
31:01;31:09;"So for them to specifically call you a different name is to literally rob you of your identity."
31:09;31:15;"And it's a power move that basically shames you, that erases you from the equation."
31:15;31:17;"So like, yeah, I get it."
31:17;31:25;"But no matter how kind and sweet they've been, they are really just removing the individuality of who you are."
31:25;31:31;"I have a really positive heart-to-heart with like a 90-year-old person and they get the name wrong."
31:31;31:32;"I'm like, hey, don't sweat it."
31:32;31:34;"And then I walk away and then I like pause."
31:34;31:35;"That pops in my head and I just walk back."
31:35;31:38;"But at the same time, my name is me."
31:38;31:39;"You just erased me."
31:39;31:40;"Yeah."
31:40;31:41;"Honestly, [bleep] you."
31:41;31:42;"Because you know what?"
31:42;31:46;"Later that 90-year-old is like, I had a nice chat with that Elijah boy."
31:46;31:48;"Who's Elijah?"
31:48;31:50;"Ah, the boy who was here earlier."
31:50;31:52;"I was talking to him, Elijah."
31:52;31:53;"I don't know who that is."
31:53;31:55;"But now it doesn't register."
31:55;31:58;"There is no way to even trace down who you are."
31:58;31:59;"It's kind of like when--"
31:59;32:00;"You don't exist."
32:00;32:03;"At that point, Ezra, you don't exist."
32:03;32:05;"It's kind of like when Dick Picks became Richard Pictures."
32:05;32:06;"It is."
32:06;32:08;"It's the same thing."
32:08;32:09;"A history."
32:09;32:10;"I don't like that at all."
32:10;32:11;"A band vanished."
32:11;32:13;"You better guess who's in Richard's pictures."
32:13;32:14;"Elijah."
32:14;32:15;"You know what I'm saying?"
32:15;32:16;"Richard Pictures."
32:17;32:18;"[laughter]"
32:18;32:19;"Okay, but anyway."
32:19;32:20;"Oh, Joker Man."
32:20;32:21;"We're talking about fonts."
32:21;32:23;"Without going into it, I love fonts."
32:23;32:26;"They started in the late '80s, moved into the '90s."
32:26;32:29;"These kind of fun post--"
32:29;32:30;"What would you call them?"
32:30;32:31;"Neo-hippie type fonts."
32:31;32:34;"A lot of handwritten ones."
32:34;32:37;"The Cure was kind of pioneers of it."
32:37;32:40;"And then once you get to the '90s, you see all these wacky, fun fonts."
32:40;32:41;"I've seen it--"
32:41;32:48;"As I started talking about it a lot, some people have told me that some people call this family of fonts Global Coffeehouse."
32:48;32:49;"Oh, sure."
32:49;32:51;"Which is right on."
32:51;32:52;"That's a great way to put it."
32:52;32:59;"And the most basic version of all these fonts, the one that you could actually maybe have on the family computer, is called Joker Man."
32:59;33:02;"And Joker Man, you see it pop up."
33:02;33:06;"I recently saw a barbershop in Hollywood that used Joker Man font."
33:06;33:10;"And it's a font that has a lot of energy, a playfulness."
33:10;33:14;"You could say maybe a touch of hippiness about it, but it's fun."
33:14;33:21;"Anyway, so Joker Man is perhaps like one of the pillars of this font family, this font community."
33:21;33:24;"And I was posting about the font Joker Man."
33:24;33:31;"Then a friend of mine I actually know through CT, Nick Mancia, hit me up saying, ""Yeah, and how about that Bob Dylan song, Joker Man?"""
33:31;33:32;"And I vaguely knew that song."
33:32;33:34;"I hadn't thought about it in a long time."
33:34;33:37;"Then I returned and I started listening to this Bob Dylan song, Joker Man."
33:37;33:40;"And I realized, I love this song."
33:40;33:42;"This is a great Bob Dylan song."
33:42;33:46;"And it's from '80s Dylan, which is not considered one of Bob's greatest periods."
33:46;33:49;"But I think the real Bob Dylan has considered this one of his best songs."
33:49;33:52;"His voice was starting to sound a little different in the '80s."
33:52;33:56;"But I got so into this song, I even started to think, ""You know what?"
33:56;33:59;"Maybe one day Vampire Weekend will get a cover of this going."""
33:59;34:00;"That'd be sick."
34:00;34:01;"It'd be tight."
34:01;34:05;"So anyway, this is also a very early warning shot to the Vampire Weekend fan community."
34:05;34:07;"Lightly familiarize yourself with Joker Man."
34:07;34:08;"What are they called?"
34:08;34:10;"So if we bust it out."
34:10;34:14;"It's funny. The Time Crisis community are called TC Heads."
34:14;34:17;"Vampire Weekend has never had a good name for our fans."
34:17;34:18;"Really?"
34:18;34:19;"Yeah."
34:19;34:20;"Like the Weekenders?"
34:20;34:21;"It's too much of a mouthful."
34:21;34:23;"I don't think it goes down easy."
34:23;34:24;"How about this?"
34:24;34:29;"Let's do a contest where somebody in the audience gets to name the fans of Vampire Weekend."
34:29;34:32;"And we'll just let them have that for real for the rest of time."
34:32;34:33;"Let's try it."
34:33;34:35;"I have a feeling we've put this out there before."
34:35;34:37;"It just never anything-- nothing clicks."
34:37;34:38;"But yeah, please."
34:38;34:39;"If anybody has any ideas, let us know."
34:39;34:42;"But anyway, also just generally saying to Vampire Weekend fans,"
34:42;34:45;"maybe next year VW bust this out and you'll be like, ""Oh yeah, I know that song."""
34:45;34:47;"Anyway, this is the song Joker Man."
34:47;34:54;"Sly and Robbie, famous reggae rhythm section playing on this."
34:54;34:58;"Mark Knopfler, some real tasteful guitar licks coming in and out."
34:58;34:59;"He also produced it."
35:08;35:09;"That knob flick."
35:09;35:12;"[MUSIC - SLY AND ROBBIE, ""JOKER MAN""]"
35:23;35:48;"A lot of great lyrics in this song."
35:48;35:50;"Demanding bass playing, too."
35:50;35:51;"Yeah, I remember that."
35:51;35:54;"[MUSIC - SLY AND ROBBIE, ""JOKER MAN""]"
36:31;36:34;"It's a great song, but it made me think a little bit about--"
36:34;36:38;"'80s Dylan was the time when his voice started to put people off, I think."
36:38;36:40;"Maybe it started in the '70s."
36:40;36:43;"He's really, like, leaning into some of the Dylanisms."
36:43;36:44;"Right."
36:44;36:46;"I mean, he's still got his range at this point."
36:46;36:51;"Yeah, it's not really until, I feel like, the '90s that he really starts to lose--"
36:51;36:55;"it starts to get narrower and more ragged."
36:55;36:57;"He can't articulate melodies, really."
36:57;37:03;"In this moment, I think his voice was becoming a little more idiosyncratic."
37:03;37:06;"Was it? Or just maybe the Dylan fan sort of soured on it?"
37:06;37:07;"What year is this?"
37:07;37:10;"This is '83, '84."
37:10;37:12;"Is this religious Dylan?"
37:12;37:13;"This is right after that period."
37:13;37:14;"Right after?"
37:14;37:16;"This is when he stopped being Christian."
37:16;37:20;"Well, anyway, it's a great song, and because I was watching the video a bunch,"
37:20;37:24;"YouTube suggested I also check out a video of Bob Dylan at We Are The World."
37:24;37:27;"And this is cool. I'd never seen this before."
37:27;37:34;"Bob Dylan is one of the people singing on the famous charity song We Are The World."
37:34;37:36;"♪ We are the world, we are the children ♪"
37:36;37:39;"So he sings in the choir with all the other stars."
37:39;37:40;"Sure."
37:40;37:43;"Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Cyndi Lauper, all the big stars of the '80s."
37:43;37:47;"He's kind of one of the only '60s dudes in the mix."
37:47;37:52;"And I guess at a certain point he had to record his part."
37:52;37:55;"And he's a little bit the odd man out, and so there's this footage on YouTube."
37:55;37:59;"It's nine minutes of him just, like, trying to get his part down."
37:59;38:02;"Stevie Wonders in the background helping him out playing piano."
38:02;38:03;"That's where he's going in on it."
38:03;38:04;"Stevie."
38:05;38:07;"Can you play it one time?"
38:07;38:08;"Come on, man."
38:08;38:10;"So he's working on it with--"
38:10;38:12;"Stevie's helping him out."
38:12;38:13;"Diana Ross is leaving the room."
38:13;38:18;"Giving him some space to get it right."
38:18;38:20;"He's kind of showing it to him."
38:20;38:22;"He gets back on the mic."
38:22;38:24;"Again, doesn't seem that--seems a little uncomfortable."
38:24;38:27;"♪ We're saving our own lives ♪"
38:27;38:30;"♪ It's true, we make a better day ♪"
38:30;38:31;"♪ Just you and me ♪"
38:31;38:35;"Although he's in tune."
38:35;38:37;"What's that?"
38:37;38:38;"Just stay right in the mic like that, Bobby."
38:38;38:39;"That's beautiful."
38:39;38:42;"And you know what's nice, man, is you sing along with the chorus like that, too."
38:42;38:44;"Quincy being very supportive."
38:44;38:45;"It's so funny."
38:45;38:48;"His speaking voice is almost like he's in character, too."
38:48;38:49;"Okay."
38:49;38:50;"That's beautiful."
38:50;38:53;"Because that's the only time we use the low octave."
38:53;38:54;"All right, man."
38:54;38:55;"It's time to--"
38:55;38:56;"He looks so deeply uncomfortable."
38:56;38:58;"It's fascinating that Dylan, yeah, like, he's in key."
38:58;38:59;"It's not that he can't sing."
38:59;39:04;"He's really--watching the video is interesting because he's like--"
39:04;39:06;"he's posturing in a funny way."
39:06;39:10;"He's got, like, this very funny physicality that, like, belies how uncomfortable he is."
39:10;39:11;"Right."
39:11;39:15;"The thumb has not left his pocket, weirdly."
39:21;39:24;"And as always, he always nails it when they're kind of rehearsing."
39:24;39:26;"And then they're like, ""Let's roll tape."""
39:26;39:28;"And it just never sounds quite as good."
39:28;39:30;"We've all had that experience."
39:30;39:34;"Also, I feel like this type of situation has a lot--like, the person who has to do something is uncomfortable."
39:34;39:37;"And they're just like, ""Is that sort of it?"""
39:37;39:39;"And everybody's like, ""Oh, yeah!"""
39:39;39:41;"""You're f---ing killing it."""
39:41;39:44;"I wonder if they asked Neil Young to do this."
39:44;39:47;"I'm sure they did, but I'm sure, like, everything he said, ""No."""
39:47;39:50;"I feel like Neil Young is the--"
39:50;39:51;"Surprisingly--"
39:51;39:53;"--Murray of rock."
39:53;39:54;"Well, Dylan, too, is."
39:54;39:55;"I mean, surprising he did it."
39:55;39:58;"You've heard the David Lee Roth tapes, right?"
39:58;39:59;"I don't think I have."
39:59;40:02;"On this show, we've never gotten deep on, like, the recordings of people."
40:02;40:04;"What's the David Lee Roth one?"
40:04;40:06;"David Lee Roth, ""Running with the Devil."""
40:06;40:07;"Just, like, isolated vocal?"
40:07;40:08;"Oh, yeah."
40:08;40:09;"Oh, my God."
40:09;40:10;"I love this stuff."
40:10;40:12;"This is actually from the record?"
40:12;40:14;"I think-- I believe this is it."
40:14;40:16;"Oh!"
40:16;40:20;"Oh, yes!"
40:20;40:24;"Yeah, yeah!"
40:24;40:26;"Ha, yeah!"
40:26;40:28;"[laughter]"
40:28;40:33;"I live my life like there's no tomorrow."
40:33;40:35;"And all I've got--"
40:35;40:36;"Good vibrato."
40:36;40:38;"--I had to steal."
40:38;40:43;"Least I don't need Tobago Burrow."
40:43;40:44;"Burrow!"
40:44;40:49;"Yes, I'm living at a base that kills."
40:49;40:51;"Oh, yeah!"
40:51;40:52;"[laughter]"
40:52;40:57;"[screeching]"
40:57;41:00;"[laughter]"
41:00;41:02;"It's all the incidental noises."
41:02;41:03;"Yeah, right."
41:03;41:04;"He has a good voice."
41:04;41:05;"He's like--"
41:05;41:06;"Oh, yeah."
41:06;41:07;"How does he do that?"
41:07;41:08;"[screeching]"
41:08;41:09;"But it's like--"
41:09;41:10;"[screeching]"
41:10;41:12;"He's almost getting into some weird, like, throat-singing territory, like hitting two--"
41:12;41:14;"Like a two-tone throat singer?"
41:14;41:15;"He's getting two tones?"
41:15;41:16;"Yeah, exactly."
41:16;41:17;"He's getting pretty two-tone."
41:17;41:21;"I remember stumbling across the Chris Cornell vocals from, like, Bad Motor Finger era Soundgarden."
41:21;41:22;"Yeah."
41:22;41:23;"Singing is so brutal."
41:23;41:24;"Insanity."
41:24;41:26;"Shout-out to anybody who, like, goes for it."
41:26;41:30;"Well, I've got a feeling so down"
41:30;41:34;"I've got a feeling so down"
41:34;41:38;"I kept the movie rolling"
41:38;41:43;"But the story's getting old now"
41:43;41:45;"Oh, yeah"
41:45;41:52;"I just looked in the mirror"
41:52;41:56;"And things aren't looking so good"
41:56;42:00;"I'm looking California"
42:01;42:05;"And feeling Minnesota"
42:05;42:08;"Oh, yeah"
42:08;42:19;"Who gets mystified?"
42:19;42:25;"Who gets mystified?"
42:26;42:31;"Show me the power of child I'd like to save"
42:31;42:35;"But I'm down on my knees today"
42:35;42:39;"Yeah, it gives me the butterflies"
42:39;42:41;"Gives me a way"
42:41;42:45;"To climb up on my feet again"
42:45;42:47;"Hey, I'm feeling"
42:47;42:53;"Oh, I'm feeling all-time, all-time, all-time, all-time"
42:53;42:54;"Yeah"
42:54;42:57;"Another thing we should say about Joker Man, the font,"
42:57;43:01;"is that it's on the back of these new 8-minute Cape Cod long sleeves."
43:01;43:04;"We just got a shipment of how many?"
43:04;43:06;"We got 50 long sleeves."
43:06;43:10;"I mean, to be fair, a lot of the Time Crisis fat cats are gonna skim off the top."
43:10;43:12;"The TCFCs?"
43:12;43:14;"The TCFCs."
43:14;43:20;"The TCFCs, you know, the friends and family of the inner circle of Time Crisis, the elites."
43:20;43:21;"Skimming 20% right off the top."
43:21;43:23;"We're gonna be skimming off these."
43:23;43:26;"But Seinfeld took the classic 8-minute Cape Cod shirt"
43:26;43:28;"and put it on a black long sleeve."
43:28;43:32;"'Cause we've done white shirts, we've done tie-dye,"
43:32;43:36;"but we've never done just a very simple, tasteful black long sleeve."
43:36;43:38;"It says ""8-minute Cape Cod,"" and on the back,"
43:38;43:42;"it says one of Jake's classic quotes, ""This show rules."""
43:42;43:46;"And Seinfeld, when you first sent me it, I thought it looked great."
43:46;43:47;"I had one note."
43:47;43:49;"On the back, you put that s*** in Joker Man."
43:49;43:52;"Because Joker Man's a really hot font right now."
43:52;43:54;"Everybody's talking about it."
43:54;43:56;"And I just knew that the fans were gonna love it."
43:56;43:59;"You got Futura on the front, Joker Man in the back."
43:59;44:00;"Why not Joker Man on the front?"
44:00;44:02;"Maybe next time--we'll see how these ones do."
44:02;44:04;"Next time we can switch it up."
44:04;44:07;"Futura bold on the back, Joker Man on the front."
44:07;44:09;"I'd like a one-off all Joker Man."
44:09;44:11;"All Joker Man?"
44:11;44:16;"I want a shirt that just says, ""In Joker Man, all Joker Man."""
44:16;44:18;"All Joker Man?"
44:18;44:19;"I actually had this thought--"
44:19;44:20;"And then on the back--"
44:20;44:21;"That's sick."
44:21;44:23;"And on the back, TCFC."
44:23;44:24;"That's tight."
44:24;44:30;"You know, it's funny you say that because I guess Time Crisis has also proven to be a very good dry run for Vampire Weekend."
44:30;44:35;"It's a place where we can speak freely, come up with ideas such as 8-Minute Cape Cod, you know?"
44:35;44:37;"Which then we can implement later."
44:37;44:40;"This is kind of, in some ways, Vampire Weekend R&D."
44:40;44:41;"A laboratory."
44:41;44:42;"It's a laboratory."
44:42;44:45;"This is the test kitchen for Vampire Weekend."
44:45;44:50;"Wait, who is a--isn't there like a Chipotle test kitchen in New York?"
44:50;44:52;"Everybody has--oh, oh, I don't know about in New York."
44:52;44:54;"I went to the Panda Express one in Pasadena."
44:54;44:55;"And you're alive?"
44:55;44:56;"Oh, yeah."
44:56;44:59;"Wait, and what happens at the Panda Express test kitchen?"
44:59;45:00;"It's the same thing that happens--"
45:00;45:01;"It's organic chicken?"
45:01;45:02;"No."
45:03;45:04;"It's basically the same."
45:04;45:05;"It's just like Plucker's."
45:05;45:10;"It's a lovely breast of chicken, lovingly, tenderly grilled."
45:10;45:12;"Does Plucker's have a test kitchen?"
45:12;45:14;"I guarantee Plucker's has a test kitchen."
45:14;45:18;"If you work at the Plucker's test kitchen, get in touch with us."
45:18;45:20;"Okay, wait, by the way, rewind."
45:20;45:22;"[rewind sound]"
45:22;45:24;"What is a test kitchen?"
45:24;45:28;"Because I assume that a test kitchen used to be like you could imagine some big food corporation"
45:28;45:31;"would have a test kitchen where they literally are testing their food products."
45:31;45:36;"But then it did become this thing where a lot of these chain restaurants have test kitchens"
45:36;45:40;"that are really just a slightly more upscale version of the spot."
45:40;45:42;"Oh, wait, is that a real thing?"
45:42;45:45;"Yeah, the Panda Express test kitchen, it's not like you got ushered into--"
45:45;45:46;"Like an industrial park?"
45:46;45:49;"Yeah, you weren't on like the 20th floor of Panda Express headquarters."
45:49;45:52;"No, no, no, it was in sort of like--"
45:52;45:53;"PEHQ."
45:53;45:55;"An upscale strip mall."
45:55;45:56;"It's just a Panda Express."
45:56;45:57;"Ooh, upscale."
45:57;45:59;"You had me at upscale strip mall."
45:59;46:01;"There's a Nordstrom rack."
46:01;46:06;"Was there anything about the ambiance of this Panda Express test kitchen that was a cut above?"
46:06;46:11;"Yeah, it was a few years ago, but I remember thinking, ""This is awesome."""
46:11;46:12;"Yeah."
46:12;46:14;"[laughter]"
46:14;46:16;"That's what you remember thinking?"
46:16;46:17;"Yeah."
46:17;46:18;"""This is awesome."""
46:18;46:20;"I think I actually-- maybe I shouldn't admit this, but I went twice."
46:20;46:21;"Oh, wow."
46:21;46:22;"Yeah."
46:22;46:23;"Wait, so you really liked it?"
46:23;46:24;"Solo?"
46:24;46:25;"No, no, no."
46:25;46:28;"Someone, a producer asked if I wanted to have a meeting there."
46:28;46:29;"Really?"
46:29;46:33;"The answer is no, because that person's a murderer, not a producer."
46:33;46:34;"[laughter]"
46:34;46:37;"Nobody has a meeting at a Panda Express test kitchen."
46:37;46:39;"What were you the producer for?"
46:39;46:41;"I don't understand, because when you look up--"
46:41;46:42;"Porno?"
46:42;46:43;"When you look up fast food--"
46:43;46:44;"A porno producer?"
46:44;46:45;"A porno."
46:45;46:47;"It was an Oscar-nominated producer."
46:47;46:48;"Okay."
46:48;46:49;"Oh, God."
46:49;46:51;"Maybe that's their way of showing you, ""I'm down to earth, but not that down to earth."""
46:51;46:52;"Exactly, yeah."
46:52;46:56;"I'd love to take you to the Panda Express test kitchen."
46:56;47:00;"But there's no part of the Panda Express test kitchen where you kind of see through a window"
47:00;47:01;"and you see people in lab coats."
47:01;47:02;"No, no, no."
47:02;47:04;"Wait, how did we start talking about test kitchens?"
47:04;47:05;"I have a question for you."
47:05;47:06;"Yeah."
47:06;47:09;"Have you ever been on the website, defonts.com?"
47:09;47:10;"Defonts?"
47:10;47:11;"Yeah."
47:11;47:12;"I don't think so."
47:12;47:13;"You've never been on Define Fonts?"
47:13;47:14;"Yeah."
47:14;47:15;"I have spent hours on that."
47:15;47:16;"I've seen other people on it."
47:16;47:17;"Do you think they--"
47:17;47:18;"I'm really busy."
47:18;47:25;"I wonder if they have a hashtag that you can search for global coffee house fonts, because"
47:25;47:28;"I'd love to find some more behind-- Oh, you know what?"
47:28;47:29;"Now I remembered."
47:29;47:30;"This is great radio."
47:30;47:33;"We were saying that Time Crisis is a bit of a test kitchen."
47:33;47:34;"It's kind of a Panda--"
47:34;47:36;"Yes, Vampire Weekend's test kitchen."
47:36;47:38;"It's a bit of a Panda Express test kitchen."
47:38;47:43;"I did have this idea that some ideas maybe are too outlandish for the larger Vampire"
47:43;47:48;"Weekend fan community, but the TC heads, which is not exclusively Vampire Weekend fans, I"
47:48;47:49;"think we've joked about this before."
47:49;47:54;"Is there anybody who just hates Vampire Weekend, who's like, ""Love Time Crisis, though."""
47:54;47:55;"I bet there is."
47:55;47:56;"There's probably a few people."
47:56;47:57;"Write in."
47:57;47:58;"Yeah, let us know."
47:58;47:59;"Would love to know."
47:59;48:02;"Hashtag love that TC, hashtag hate that VM."
48:02;48:03;"Hate that V-Dubs."
48:03;48:04;"V-Dubs, rather."
48:04;48:10;"But I was saying, I did have this idea a while ago of Vampire Weekend maybe could just do"
48:10;48:14;"some font shirts, and it would be the Vampire Weekend Joker Man shirt."
48:14;48:19;"It would say Vampire Weekend Joker Man, and then maybe on the back say Joker Man shirt,"
48:19;48:22;"or have the whole alphabet on the sleeves or something."
48:22;48:24;"You know, really lean into it."
48:24;48:28;"At first, I was trying to think which fonts would be fun to do, and then I realized Papyrus"
48:28;48:30;"is kind of played out to joke about."
48:30;48:32;"SNL did a sketch about Papyrus already."
48:32;48:34;"And of course, Comic Sans is beyond dead."
48:34;48:35;"Zapf Dingbats."
48:35;48:39;"It's a Zapf Dingbat shirt."
48:39;48:43;"It's all Zapf Dingbats on the front and the sleeves, and then in the back in Joker Man,"
48:43;48:47;"it's like a full essay that explains the front part says Vampire Weekend."
48:47;48:48;"I would also love-"
48:48;48:49;"Zapf Dingbats."
48:49;48:54;"Yeah, I would also love it if it just on the back said Zapf Dingbats in Joker Man font."
48:54;48:58;"Joker Man dance to the light of the moon."
48:58;49:01;"But I've also been thinking about Joker Man is a fascinating font."
49:01;49:02;"It's a fascinating song."
49:02;49:06;"And then I was also thinking about something, because as I really poured over the lyrics"
49:06;49:09;"to Bob Dylan's Joker Man, which I recommend everybody spend some time with."
49:09;49:11;"It's a very strong song."
49:11;49:13;"He keeps talking about this person, Joker Man."
49:13;49:17;"It's almost like, as in a lot of Bob Dylan songs, he's like pulling from ancient history,"
49:17;49:20;"Americana, his own mythology."
49:20;49:22;"And you're like, who is Joker Man?"
49:22;49:23;"Is he talking to himself?"
49:23;49:25;"I saw some people in the comments saying, ""We're all Joker Man."""
49:25;49:28;"And then I kept thinking, like, yeah, who's the Joker Man?"
49:28;49:29;"Is it like the Joker?"
49:29;49:32;"Is it the Joker in the deck of cards?"
49:32;49:36;"And then I realized, if you just want to call somebody a joker, you'd say joker, right?"
49:36;49:37;"There's probably a lot of songs."
49:37;49:40;"There's the Joker by an enemy of the show, Steve Miller."
49:40;49:42;"I didn't know you guys had enemies."
49:42;49:43;"Oh, yeah, we hate Steve Miller."
49:43;49:44;"Oh, I get it."
49:44;49:47;"He talked about Jerry Garcia after Jerry had passed."
49:47;49:48;"Oh, interesting."
49:48;49:52;"And while Jerry was alive, he had no problem opening up for the Grateful Dead and even"
49:52;49:54;"sitting in with them on occasion."
49:54;49:55;"Back in '92."
49:55;49:58;"And then he also ignored our pleas on social media."
49:58;50:00;"We wanted him to come clear his name."
50:00;50:01;"Yeah."
50:01;50:05;"That's surprising because he was so cool about his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction."
50:05;50:06;"Wait, Steve Miller?"
50:06;50:07;"Right?"
50:07;50:10;"Wasn't he like a total asshole about it a couple years ago?"
50:10;50:11;"Oh, really?"
50:11;50:12;"That does ring a bell."
50:12;50:14;"He was like really pissed off and was basically like, ""Fuck you guys."""
50:14;50:15;"Oh, yeah."
50:15;50:17;"Let's put a pin in that one."
50:17;50:18;"Let's return to that."
50:18;50:19;"We'll return to Steve Miller shortly."
50:19;50:22;"So I was thinking, what does this mean, Joker Man?"
50:22;50:28;"And then I had a thought that Joker Man is kind of like Joker plus Batman."
50:28;50:33;"Joker Man is kind of a yin yang that has the hero and the villain combined."
50:33;50:34;"Joker Man."
50:34;50:38;"And actually, in the music video for Bob Dylan's Joker Man, there's even an image of the Joker,"
50:38;50:39;"the DC character."
50:39;50:41;"So I started to think more."
50:41;50:44;"Joker Man is a hybrid of Joker and Batman."
50:44;50:45;"Whoa."
50:45;50:47;"The good and the evil."
50:47;50:49;"And the good that's in the evil and the evil that's in the good."
50:49;50:50;"You know what I'm saying?"
50:50;50:51;"Joker Man."
50:51;50:52;"That's humanity."
50:52;50:53;"Combo."
50:53;50:54;"That's deep."

52:07;52:08;"What if I do it from memory?"
52:08;52:09;"It doesn't matter."
52:09;52:10;"The song doesn't exist."
52:10;52:11;"It doesn't exist, basically,"
52:11;52:12;"'cause you've chosen the font."
52:12;52:14;"I wake up tomorrow with an eerie feeling."
52:14;52:15;"I don't know what it is,"
52:15;52:16;"but something is different in the love."
52:16;52:17;"You love the font on your shirt."
52:17;52:18;"Right."
52:18;52:19;"It's called ""Joker Man."""
52:19;52:21;"It's a song by the Capitalist Society."

52:23;52:25;"It's just a question I've been wondering lately."
52:25;52:27;"(laughing)"
52:27;52:30;"Oh, God, that would be a good take."
52:30;52:32;"You know, these days, everybody's kind of arguing"
52:32;52:35;"about socialism versus capitalism,"
52:35;52:39;"and generally speaking, the debate is which is better."
52:39;52:41;"People say, ""Well, socialism's gonna turn"

54:31;54:33;"My criteria is which one is going to result"
54:33;54:36;"in more cold, hard cash for me and my organization."
54:36;54:37;"Sure."
54:37;54:38;"Because I'm running a small business here."
54:38;54:39;"Because VW, Inc."
54:39;54:42;"Also, potential name for the fans, Vwinks."

56:36;56:37;"tens of millions of records."
56:37;56:39;"This could result in tens of millions of fans"
56:39;56:40;"for Vampire Weekend."
56:40;56:43;"Next thing you know, we can't even fit in stadiums"
56:43;56:45;"because we have tens of millions of new fans."
56:45;56:46;"Everybody's talking."
56:46;56:47;"I think you're missing a real obvious thing here."
56:47;56:48;"What's that?"
56:48;56:49;"From this very show."
56:49;56:51;"You are obsessed with covering ""Joker Man."""
56:51;56:56;"The move, unequivocally, is to cover ""We Are the World."""
56:56;56:58;"Oh."
56:58;57:02;"Now, Vampire Weekend starts playing ""We Are the World"""
57:02;57:06;"live on Lollapalooza 1998,"
57:06;57:10;"following iced tea and body cut."
57:10;57:13;"And you guys are just straight up playing ""We Are the World""?"
57:13;57:18;"By the way, you aping every vocal cadence and style?"
57:18;57:20;"I mean, like that, you want to make money, Ezra?"
57:20;57:22;"You want to make money?"
57:22;57:27;"Do ""We Are the World"" but for profit."
57:27;57:28;"That's a pretty good idea."
57:28;57:30;"For profit, ""We Are the World,"" because guess what?"
57:30;57:34;"That song is too synonymous with charity."
57:34;57:35;"That's right."
57:35;57:36;"That's a pretty good idea."
57:36;57:37;"And I also like the idea of doing all the different voices"
57:38;57:41;"because impressionists, they can do a show in Vegas"
57:41;57:42;"like a Frank Caliendo."
57:42;57:43;"These guys rake it in."
57:43;57:45;"Do you think of yourself more as a musician"
57:45;57:46;"or an impressionist?"
57:46;57:49;"True question."
57:49;57:51;"Because I have it on good authority"
57:51;57:54;"that you were simultaneously offered a record contract"
57:54;57:56;"and a spot on ""SNL."""
57:56;57:57;"But just as the impressions guy."
57:57;57:58;"Just as an impressions guy."
57:58;58:00;"Lauren said you're deeply unfunny,"
58:00;58:02;"but your impressions are pretty good."
58:02;58:03;"Are flawless."
58:03;58:04;"Your Cyndi Lauper is amazing."
58:04;58:05;"Your Hall & Oates is legendary."
58:05;58:07;"I bet there have been some people--"
58:07;58:09;"I don't want to get into the ""SNL"" stuff."
58:09;58:11;"It sounds like a very tense work environment."
58:11;58:13;"But I wonder if there have been ""SNL""--"
58:13;58:16;"because everybody always talks about that in ""SNL."""
58:16;58:17;"It's very competitive."
58:17;58:18;"It's cutthroat."
58:18;58:20;"And I mean, to be fair, ""SNL"" is an American show,"
58:20;58:22;"and we live in a capitalist society."
58:22;58:22;"So--"
58:22;58:23;"Do we?"
58:23;58:24;"Do we, though?"
58:24;58:25;"Do we, though?"
58:25;58:27;"So if everybody is pretty good at something,"
58:27;58:29;"there might be some respect to be like, hey, guys,"
58:29;58:33;"thousands and thousands of comedians and improvers."
58:33;58:35;"And we all made it to ""SNL."""
58:35;58:36;"Like, let's stick together."
58:36;58:37;"We're buddies."
58:37;58:38;"That's not how it works."
58:38;58:41;"People get-- behind the scenes, it can get kind of competitive."
58:41;58:44;"And I wonder if there's been situations in ""SNL"""
58:44;58:47;"where somebody's just like, bro, you're not even funny."
58:47;58:48;"You're just an impressionist."
58:48;58:50;"I'm certain that has happened."
58:50;58:51;"Actually--"
58:51;58:52;"I mean, it's interesting."
58:52;58:53;"I'm certainly certain that has happened."
58:53;58:55;"I mean, look who I'm talking to."
58:55;58:58;"Jason, you're a major dude in the comedy community."
58:58;59:00;"Is there a thing that comedians and impressionists"
59:00;59:01;"don't really respect you?"
59:01;59:02;"There is like--"
59:02;59:04;"I don't know about respect, but there"
59:04;59:08;"is definitely like a perceived hierarchy in which like"
59:08;59:13;"comedians will dismiss impressionists or prop"
59:13;59:15;"comedians or people that are doing what"
59:15;59:17;"are perceived of as gimmicks."
59:17;59:18;"You know, like--"
59:18;59:19;"and I don't necessarily believe this."
59:19;59:21;"I think this is a little bit more in the stand-up world"
59:21;59:24;"because they all kind of exist in that same world together."
59:24;59:26;"But I think like people like the, I guess,"
59:26;59:31;"Carrot Top or people who are doing like funny songs"
59:31;59:33;"or things that are considered to be gimmicks"
59:33;59:37;"are somehow, I feel like, in the stand-up world kind of dismissed."
59:38;59:39;"(SINGING) Time's a hard--"
59:39;59:42;"you're afraid to pay the fee."
59:42;59:50;"So you find yourself somebody who can do the job for free."
59:50;59:57;"When you need a bit of loving 'cause your man is out of town,"
59:57;01:00:00;"that's the time you get me running."
01:00:00;01:00:03;"And you know I'll be around."
01:00:03;01:00:10;"I'm a fool to do your dirty work."
01:00:10;01:00:13;"Oh, yeah."
01:00:13;01:00:19;"I don't want to do your dirty work no more."
01:00:19;01:00:23;"I'm a fool to do your dirty work."
01:00:23;01:00:24;"Oh, yeah."
01:00:29;01:00:34;"Light the candle, put the lock upon the door."
01:00:34;01:00:42;"You have sent a maid home early like a thousand times before."
01:00:42;01:00:49;"Like the castle in his corner in a medieval game,"
01:00:49;01:00:52;"I foresee terrible trouble."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"And I stay here just the same."
01:00:58;01:01:02;"I'm a fool to do your dirty work."
01:01:02;01:01:05;"Oh, yeah."
01:01:05;01:01:11;"I don't want to do your dirty work no more."
01:01:11;01:01:15;"I'm a fool to do your dirty work."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"Oh, yeah."
01:01:17;01:01:22;"You're listening to ""Time Crisis"" on Beats 1."
01:01:22;01:01:25;"It's not right, man, because impressionists--"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"I would put them above comedians,"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"because an impressionist is more like a scientist."
01:01:29;01:01:31;"They're having to study all sorts of--"
01:01:31;01:01:34;"And that's who we want doing our comedy, scientists."
01:01:34;01:01:38;"But I'm just saying, maybe they're not comedians."
01:01:38;01:01:39;"But what they're doing--"
01:01:39;01:01:40;"Right, they're scientists."
01:01:40;01:01:42;"They're studying vocal cords."
01:01:42;01:01:45;"They're doing original research to figure out"
01:01:45;01:01:48;"ways in which they can manipulate their own voice"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"to sound like somebody else."
01:01:50;01:01:56;"But would you say that a very good ""Vampire Weekend"""
01:01:56;01:01:59;"cover band that has done a very good job"
01:01:59;01:02:04;"of figuring out scientifically how to ape your sound,"
01:02:04;01:02:10;"your tone, everything, is that as valid as what you do?"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"If they really were like Frank Caliendo level good--"
01:02:12;01:02:13;"Wait, Frank Caliendo--"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"Have you seen Frank Caliendo cover your songs?"
01:02:15;01:02:16;"Frank Caliendo is an impressionist, right?"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"Yes, he is."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"I just want to make sure I'm not talking about--"
01:02:19;01:02:20;"No, you're right. He is."
01:02:20;01:02:21;"--like a football coach from the '60s,"
01:02:21;01:02:24;"and I'll just keep saying, like, Frank Caliendo."
01:02:24;01:02:25;"I would respect-- in fact, you know what?"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"I was thinking about recently--"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"I didn't read the review, but I heard that Pitchfork"
01:02:29;01:02:32;"gave Greta Van Fleet a terrible review."
01:02:32;01:02:33;"1.6."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"Very bad review."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"You guys are already familiar with this."
01:02:35;01:02:36;"Yes."
01:02:36;01:02:37;"And I didn't read it, but I've heard them,"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"and I was like, it's crazy how much"
01:02:39;01:02:40;"they sound like Led Zeppelin."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"But then I started to think outside the box a little bit."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"OK."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"And I was like, oh, I hate to see, like, a young band"
01:02:45;01:02:46;"get beat up on."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"Yeah, they're so young."
01:02:47;01:02:48;"Yeah, it's like--"
01:02:48;01:02:49;"They're like 19."
01:02:49;01:02:50;"--just like, don't review it. Come on."
01:02:50;01:02:54;"But I also had this thought that I was like, in 2018,"
01:02:54;01:02:55;"if-- I haven't listened to the album."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"If, in fact, they really just made a full-on fake Led"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"Zeppelin album--"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"look, 10 years ago, that would've been an eye roll."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"20 years ago, it would've been like,"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"eyes roll out of your head."
01:03:04;01:03:07;"In 2018, is it almost, like, fascinating?"
01:03:07;01:03:08;"Kind of funny."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"Kind of tight."
01:03:09;01:03:12;"It's like a Borges story."
01:03:12;01:03:13;"It's just like, why?"
01:03:13;01:03:16;"Did you just compare Greta Van Fleet to Borges?"
01:03:16;01:03:18;"That's, like, kind of amazing."
01:03:18;01:03:21;"As someone who's read 2 and 1/2 Borges stories,"
01:03:21;01:03:22;"I am an English major."
01:03:22;01:03:23;"Labyrinth."
01:03:23;01:03:24;"Every story in Labyrinth."
01:03:25;01:03:28;"I am aware that Borges was fascinated by meaning"
01:03:28;01:03:33;"and replication and labyrinthine concepts of whatever."
01:03:33;01:03:36;"And the writer who writes the story of the story--"
01:03:36;01:03:37;"you know, whatever."
01:03:37;01:03:41;"Anyway, I think there's something quite Borgesian"
01:03:41;01:03:42;"about Greta Van Fleet."
01:03:42;01:03:43;"Oh, you got it."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"You know what?"
01:03:44;01:03:45;"Wait, what am I even referencing?"
01:03:45;01:03:48;"Pitchfork, transcribe Ezra's review."
01:03:48;01:03:49;"Update the review."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"I send Pitchfork an email."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"Hey, guys."
01:03:52;01:03:53;"I'd like to throw my hat in the ring."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"I know that generally you review albums once."
01:03:56;01:04:00;"However, given the Borgesian nature of Greta Van Fleet,"
01:04:00;01:04:04;"I think it is apropos to have two reviews."
01:04:04;01:04:07;"And I would love it if your number was only slightly"
01:04:07;01:04:07;"higher."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"[laughter]"
01:04:09;01:04:13;"If your number-- if your rating was, like, 3.7."
01:04:13;01:04:16;"I gave them a 1.9."
01:04:16;01:04:19;"What the original reviewer failed--"
01:04:19;01:04:20;"To understand--"
01:04:20;01:04:21;"--failed to understand--"
01:04:21;01:04:24;"--is that Greta Van Fleet exists in a capitalist society."
01:04:24;01:04:27;"[music - ""the biggest fan""]"
01:04:27;01:04:35;"(SINGING) Why are you so pretty?"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"I love you, children."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"I'm your biggest fan."
01:04:39;01:04:42;"I saw your picture and I took it."
01:04:42;01:04:44;"I'm the funniest in the land."
01:04:44;01:04:48;"Camera, lights, and action."
01:04:48;01:04:53;"And why'd you know so well?"
01:04:53;01:05:01;"You're in and out of fashion in Hollywood and Vail."
01:05:01;01:05:13;"By the curtain walls, walk the hallowed halls."
01:05:13;01:05:20;"Baby, watch the belly go."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"Now you're not alone."
01:05:22;01:05:25;"Yeah."
01:05:25;01:05:28;"Clearly, this is a very poorly thought out idea."
01:05:28;01:05:29;"And without having read the actual review,"
01:05:29;01:05:31;"I can't say much."
01:05:31;01:05:34;"But I did stop and think for a second that there is, like--"
01:05:34;01:05:37;"in other eras when Led Zeppelin was, like, this beloved band"
01:05:37;01:05:39;"and there were so many rock bands who"
01:05:39;01:05:41;"were kind of indebted to them, if somebody came out"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"sounding just like them and trying to copy Robert Plant,"
01:05:44;01:05:45;"you'd be like, oh my god."
01:05:45;01:05:48;"And also, Led Zeppelin broke up."
01:05:48;01:05:48;"Did they?"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"Wait, when?"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"Is Bonham playing with someone else?"
01:05:52;01:05:55;"[laughter]"
01:05:55;01:05:56;"Got some bad news for you, son."
01:05:56;01:05:58;"Oh, boy."
01:05:58;01:06:00;"I guess if you just have that Joker man mentality that,"
01:06:00;01:06:01;"in the good, there's some bad."
01:06:01;01:06:03;"In the bad, there's some good."
01:06:03;01:06:06;"And that there's not just the Joker and Batman."
01:06:06;01:06:07;"We're all Joker men."
01:06:07;01:06:09;"I think the gist of the review, if I'm remembering,"
01:06:09;01:06:12;"was that it was almost like an algorithm."
01:06:12;01:06:15;"It was a very theoretical sort of takedown."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"It was sort of like as if an algorithm had"
01:06:17;01:06:20;"written Led Zeppelin songs."
01:06:20;01:06:22;"Had, like, piecemealed it."
01:06:22;01:06:25;"Like, the shuffle from this song and the guitar feel"
01:06:25;01:06:28;"of this song, Robert Plant's approach in this song,"
01:06:28;01:06:31;"and just sort of collaged them together."
01:06:31;01:06:31;"But that's tight."
01:06:31;01:06:33;"We live in algorithmic times."
01:06:33;01:06:35;"Do we, though?"
01:06:35;01:06:35;"Answer it."
01:06:35;01:06:36;"Do we, though?"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"The theme of 2018 is algorithmism."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"I guess if they were, like, kind of, like,"
01:06:41;01:06:44;"winking more and making it more explicit that they were"
01:06:44;01:06:47;"self-aware, that they were a Zeppelin knockoff band,"
01:06:47;01:06:49;"the reviewer would have liked it more."
01:06:49;01:06:49;"If I--"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"It was, like, more like a ween vibe."
01:06:51;01:06:52;"No, I get it."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"I get it."
01:06:53;01:06:54;"Maybe if I was a reviewer, I'd feel differently."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"But--"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"If I gave you $5,000--"
01:06:57;01:06:58;"Yeah."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"--would you name the next Vampire Weekend"
01:07:00;01:07:04;"record, ""Algo Rhythm""?"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"Oh, and, like, spell, like, rhythm, like, with a Y?"
01:07:06;01:07:07;"Rhythm with a Y."
01:07:07;01:07:08;"That's sick."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"Rhythm."
01:07:10;01:07:10;"No."
01:07:10;01:07:11;"$5,000."
01:07:11;01:07:12;"$10,000."
01:07:12;01:07:13;"No, but I would--"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"I'll give you $10,000."
01:07:15;01:07:15;"Cash."
01:07:15;01:07:16;"Cash."
01:07:16;01:07:16;"Yeah."
01:07:16;01:07:19;"To name the next Vampire Weekend record,"
01:07:19;01:07:22;"""Algo-Rhythm."""
01:07:22;01:07:24;"And it's in Joker Man font."
01:07:24;01:07:25;"Wow."
01:07:25;01:07:26;"$12,000."
01:07:26;01:07:29;"That's going to garner a 1.8 on Pitchfork."
01:07:29;01:07:31;"Doesn't matter what the record sounds like."
01:07:31;01:07:32;"Joker Man."
01:07:32;01:07:35;"[laughter]"
01:07:35;01:07:36;"How quickly the sun--"
01:07:36;01:07:39;"A record title that began as a bit on a radio show."
01:07:39;01:07:41;"I'll tell you one thing, though."
01:07:41;01:07:44;"If Greta Van Fleet steals my idea to cover Joker Man,"
01:07:44;01:07:45;"I'm never sticking up for them again."
01:07:45;01:07:48;"Do you have a cover song that's in your rotation?"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"Well, I've been thinking about it a lot as I--"
