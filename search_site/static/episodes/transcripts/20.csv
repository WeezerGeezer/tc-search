00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis, back in Los Angeles."
00:06;00:10;"I'm rejoined by my LA co-host Jake Longstreth."
00:10;00:12;"He's going to be talking to us about the history of the NRA."
00:12;00:18;"We'll also be jumping on the phone with Grizzly Bears' Ed Droste to talk about Life After"
00:18;00:19;"Bernie."
00:19;00:28;"This, plus Smash Mouth, and the hits of 1968 and today."
00:28;00:35;"Welcome back to Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:59;01:09;"[applause]"
01:23;01:43;"[applause]"
03:03;03:13;"[applause]"
03:13;03:14;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
03:14;03:17;"That was the Tom Robinson band with Glad to Be Gay."
03:17;03:19;"You ever heard of Tom Robinson, Jake?"
03:19;03:20;"No."
03:20;03:25;"My dad had that record when I was growing up and Tom Robinson was kind of associated"
03:25;03:31;"with like pub rock or like punk era British music, but he was way ahead of the curve as"
03:31;03:36;"far as being an openly gay singer in a rock band in the UK and that was like a fairly"
03:36;03:41;"explicit political song that he wrote, definitely with a satirical edge, but called Glad to"
03:41;03:45;"Be Gay, which in the late 70s, I don't know how mainstream he was."
03:45;03:50;"He was definitely like a respected songwriter in the UK, but yeah, to write a song called"
03:50;03:51;"Glad to Be Gay."
03:51;03:55;"Obviously, there was like similar sentiments happening in other types of music, but especially"
03:55;03:58;"in music related to like punk rock."
03:58;04:04;"I was thinking about that song in the aftermath of the Orlando tragedy, thinking about this"
04:04;04:08;"songwriter who I always admired, Tom Robinson, and the fact that he was really ahead of his"
04:08;04:11;"time in the late 70s to sing if you're glad to be gay."
04:11;04:15;"It's crazy to recognize that that sentiment, a simple sentiment, you should be glad to"
04:15;04:22;"be yourself and specifically glad to be gay is still controversial or scary in many places,"
04:22;04:23;"including in this country."
04:23;04:29;"So on this episode, I was thinking maybe we would try to keep it real mellow, but I think"
04:29;04:31;"we have to keep it a little bit political."
04:31;04:35;"So later in the show, Jake, you've been doing such great reporting about Doritos and Fritos."
04:35;04:36;"PepsiCo."
04:36;04:37;"And PepsiCo."
04:37;04:41;"We thought that maybe you were ready to step it up and talk about the NRA."
04:41;04:42;"History of."
04:42;04:43;"Just the history of the NRA."
04:43;04:47;"It's not that different than the history of Doritos, so we'll get into that later."
04:47;04:48;"Well."
04:48;04:50;"Well, we'll find out."
04:50;04:51;"No spoilers."
04:51;04:55;"But in terms of other things going on, it's the end of the road for Bernie."
04:55;05:00;"I thought we might get my old friend, Ed Droste of the band Grizzly Bear on the phone."
05:00;05:04;"Ed's been out there campaigning for Bernie too, and I know he felt very strongly about it."
05:04;05:08;"Towards the end, you know, with all these horrible things happening in the world, I've been a"
05:08;05:09;"little bit checked out."
05:09;05:13;"It's kind of like, look, if Bernie comes through at the end, it'd be amazing."
05:13;05:17;"But at the same time, stopping Donald Trump is important and I'm not going to get on some"
05:17;05:18;"crazy like."
05:18;05:21;"Well, you know, Trump and Hillary are the same."
05:21;05:22;"That's insane to me."
05:22;05:24;"But I saw Ed was kind of like very passionate to the end."
05:24;05:28;"I had to like stop looking at social media a little bit and Ed was kind of getting some"
05:28;05:31;"flame wars on Instagram and I admire the passion."
05:31;05:34;"I just wanted to check in with him and see how he's doing."
05:34;05:37;"See if he's on board with Hillary or just all of the above."
05:37;05:38;"Yeah."
05:38;05:39;"All of the above."
05:39;05:40;"So let's give Ed a call."
05:40;05:44;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
05:44;05:48;"Hello."
05:48;05:50;"Hey, what's up, Ed?"
05:50;05:54;"You're on Time Crisis here with me and Jake Longstreth."
05:54;05:55;"Hey, guys."
05:55;05:56;"So you're in upstate New York?"
05:56;06:03;"Yes, I'm in Kingston, New York right now at a Comfort Inn by myself because I misplanned"
06:03;06:07;"my recording trip out east with the band and I have a night to kill."
06:07;06:11;"So I'm just chilling in a Comfort Inn."
06:11;06:13;"And you were working in the studio today?"
06:13;06:17;"Well, today was the pack up, but we've been there for the past two weeks and way more"
06:17;06:21;"progress than we ever thought would have happened happened, which is amazing because it's been"
06:21;06:23;"a long time for us."
06:23;06:29;"And we're super excited about having jumped into the new album process, which has been"
06:29;06:30;"a long time coming."
06:30;06:31;"But yeah, it was great."
06:31;06:34;"And we're going to come back up here again pretty soon and wrap things up."
06:34;06:35;"Great."
06:35;06:39;"So we were just talking a little bit about how it's the end of the road for Bernie."
06:39;06:40;"I hate to hear that."
06:41;06:42;"I know."
06:42;06:43;"It's realistic."
06:44;06:45;"I don't like to hear it."
06:45;06:51;"Well, there's so many dark things happening in the world now, but specifically, we wanted"
06:51;06:55;"to talk with you about Bernie because we both were out there supporting him."
06:55;07:00;"I was a little checked out towards the end, maybe because I was getting exhausted seeing"
07:00;07:04;"all the opinions one way or another, but you were kind of in it to the bitter end."
07:04;07:08;"Well, I joined in a little bit later than you because I was not able."
07:08;07:13;"I think I probably learned more about him slightly later than you did, but also I wasn't"
07:13;07:18;"able to get the band to perform and then I wasn't able to devote time being a surrogate"
07:18;07:20;"until April."
07:20;07:26;"So that's when I started actively being involved other than posting an Instagram post or something"
07:26;07:27;"like that."
07:27;07:31;"So at the end, it seemed like you were getting some flame wars on Instagram with Hillary"
07:31;07:32;"supporters."
07:32;07:33;"What was going on?"
07:33;07:37;"There was no one person that I got into a war with at all."
07:37;07:42;"I just was really annoyed with the way that things played out at the end."
07:42;07:47;"And I feel like, to be honest, this entire election has been extremely enlightening to"
07:47;07:49;"me about the process."
07:49;07:55;"And I have to say, I do feel sort of disillusioned by it all, but I definitely feel more energized"
07:55;08:04;"than usual to hopefully fix the insane amount of problems that I both witnessed and read"
08:04;08:05;"about."
08:05;08:06;"Right."
08:06;08:10;"And I feel like when I was complaining about the New York primary voter registration, it"
08:10;08:15;"was amazing to me that so many people, it kind of seemed like they agreed, but they"
08:15;08:16;"were still kind of like, but who cares?"
08:16;08:17;"It's a private institution."
08:17;08:20;"Like, oh, you care about this right now?"
08:20;08:22;"And it's like, yeah, because it's true."
08:22;08:25;"I don't think about it that much before the election."
08:25;08:30;"But as a citizen, it's like, these are things that are bigger than, way bigger than Bernie."
08:30;08:33;"So if we truly care about changing the process, it has to happen."
08:33;08:38;"And in the meantime, of course, naturally people are going to be looking to the general"
08:38;08:39;"election."
08:39;08:41;"And this one's shaping up to be especially brutal."
08:41;08:42;"So how do you feel about that, Ed?"
08:42;08:45;"Like, I know that you're very critical of Hillary."
08:45;08:48;"What you've said about her, I think, has always been certainly within reason."
08:48;08:51;"You going to be able to pull the trigger for HRC?"
08:51;08:56;"It's a tough trigger to pull, but yeah, I don't advocate not voting."
08:56;08:59;"I think it's important, even if you're not excited about the candidates."
08:59;09:02;"And to be honest, to backtrack a little bit."
09:02;09:09;"I would just like to give credit to the Sanders campaign for energizing me in a way that I've"
09:09;09:16;"never been energized to educate myself on insane intricacies and details of politics,"
09:16;09:18;"first of all, within this country."
09:18;09:24;"And also to realize how important down-ballot elections are and midterms and all those things."
09:24;09:28;"Because I was sort of a run-of-the-mill, just voting for the Dem."
09:28;09:30;"And like, we'll see how the primaries turn out."
09:30;09:36;"Like, not really that stressed about it until there was such a stark difference between Hillary and Bernie."
09:36;09:39;"And I guess it was just suddenly-- it's sort of like someone being like,"
09:39;09:43;"""You're going to be a platinum number one artist."""
09:43;09:46;"And you're like, ""What? I never thought that was possible."
09:46;09:48;"I make really melancholic, sleepy music."""
09:48;09:51;"And they're like, ""No, it is possible."""
09:51;09:53;"I mean, it's a horrible analogy, but it's sort of like--"
09:53;09:54;"You mean, you're sort of--"
09:54;09:56;"The analogy is that Bernie's like--"
09:56;09:59;"He came out of nowhere and suddenly was like this sort of like candy that was like,"
09:59;10:02;"""Wait, I didn't think we were allowed to have that."""
10:02;10:05;"It didn't even seem within the realm of possibility."
10:05;10:08;"Right, like how could a socialist truly become president?"
10:08;10:10;"A democratic socialist, Ezra. Come on."
10:10;10:11;"Right, right, right."
10:11;10:13;"Let's remember what we're talking about here."
10:13;10:16;"And that's another thing, is that he did incredibly well."
10:16;10:17;"It's amazing."
10:17;10:21;"People really didn't believe that that dude could really go that far."
10:21;10:27;"I mean, he inspired me in a way that was like next level, for sure."
10:27;10:28;"Like, it was emotional."
10:28;10:30;"The question is looking forward, though,"
10:30;10:33;"because the problem with politics--you see it on all sides."
10:33;10:36;"People really identify with politicians on a human level,"
10:36;10:38;"which can be problematic, but it's not weird."
10:38;10:39;"No."
10:39;10:41;"Some people really identify with Hillary."
10:41;10:42;"She's meaningful to them."
10:42;10:45;"They recognize themselves in her or people in their lives in her."
10:45;10:47;"And the same thing is true with Bernie."
10:47;10:50;"So the question is, ultimately, though, these are just two human beings."
10:50;10:53;"So if what we liked about Bernie were his policies,"
10:53;10:57;"then presumably the next step is to support the candidate"
10:57;11:00;"who would be the closest to Bernie's policies,"
11:00;11:03;"which between Trump and Hillary is obviously Hillary."
11:03;11:08;"Yes, and first let me say that I guess the way to look forward post-Bernie"
11:08;11:13;"is that I really hope that he's able to continue to use his leverage"
11:13;11:18;"of new voters and excitement and the movement that he's created"
11:18;11:22;"and the people around him have created to push Hillary left,"
11:22;11:24;"and I hope that she, in this age of the Internet,"
11:24;11:28;"is held accountable to a lot of the things that she suddenly swayed left to."
11:28;11:30;"So in that sense, cool."
11:30;11:34;"I feel a lot better voting for her than I would have 10 months ago."
11:34;11:38;"Whether you like Bernie or Hillary, I think we can all agree"
11:38;11:40;"that the two-party system is trash."
11:40;11:41;"It's trash."
11:41;11:43;"And anybody who loves the two-party system"
11:43;11:47;"and who loves the Democratic Party is ultimately trash"
11:47;11:48;"because the Democrats--"
11:48;11:50;"That's a bold statement, but I'll back you up."
11:50;11:53;"No, because I'm saying I like Hillary more than I like the Democratic Party."
11:53;11:55;"Hillary's just a person. She's a human being."
11:55;11:59;"She has pros and cons. She has strengths and weaknesses."
11:59;12:00;"Here's the thing."
12:00;12:04;"We've got to make it through this sure to be traumatic general election."
12:04;12:05;"See what happens after that."
12:05;12:06;"Yeah."
12:06;12:09;"Well, Ed, we're looking forward to hearing more Grizzly Bear music."
12:09;12:11;"Thanks for calling in, and keep your head up."
12:11;12:12;"I'm going to keep it up. Thank you."
12:12;12:14;"All right. See you soon, man. Bye."

18:14;18:20;"Hold me, hold me."

18:26;18:27;"Make it last."
18:27;18:45;"Oh, oh, oh, oh."
18:45;18:56;"Out of all the ways, momentary phase."
18:56;19:03;"Just like a stormy, I told you I would stay."
19:08;19:20;"Every time you try, quarter, half a mile."
19:20;19:28;"Just like a stormy, I told you I would stay."
19:28;19:31;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
19:31;19:51;"Would you hold me?"
19:51;20:04;"Maybe sometime, maybe sometime, take it far."
20:04;20:14;"Would you hold me?"
20:14;20:27;"Maybe sometime, make it easy, take it far."
20:33;20:41;"Would you hold me sometime?"
20:41;20:51;"Maybe sometime."
20:51;20:54;"Oh, oh, oh, oh."
20:54;21:06;"Oh, oh, oh, oh."
21:21;21:23;"That was Grizzly Bear with two weeks."
21:23;21:28;"Thanks again to Ed Droste for calling in and talking about Bernie."
21:28;21:32;"So you know, Jake, as we were saying, these are really heavy times, brutal times."
21:32;21:39;"And before we get into your NRA research, I wanted to talk about something a little lighter."
21:39;21:40;"Okay."
21:40;21:42;"I want to talk a little bit about Smash Mouth."
21:42;21:43;"You remember Smash Mouth?"
21:43;21:46;"Kind of. Late 90s? Early 2s?"
21:46;21:48;"Yeah, yeah, that was their heyday."
21:48;21:52;"Wait, was that the one that was like, ""Somebody!"" That one?"
21:52;21:53;"""Somebody"" what?"
21:53;21:54;"""Someone once told me."""
21:54;21:56;"""Somebody."" Yeah, yeah."
21:56;21:57;"""Somebody."""
21:57;22:06;"No, no, it's more like, ""Somebody, somebody, somebody once told me the word."""
22:06;22:08;"Anyway, I always like Smash Mouth."
22:08;22:09;"Before that, they had a bit—"
22:09;22:10;"I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed."
22:10;22:15;"I'm not the sharpest tool. Before that, they had another hit called, ""Might as well be walking on the sun."""
22:15;22:16;"Oh, yeah."
22:16;22:19;"A little like, late 90s lounge music."
22:19;22:22;"Always gave me kind of a Bossstones vibe. Mighty Mighty."
22:22;22:24;"Yeah, I mean, Mighty Mighty, Bossstones, or Ska."
22:24;22:28;"But yeah, these are like the SoCal dudes. Not a million miles away."
22:28;22:34;"But I saw this Gawker article called, ""Smash Mouth's Desperate Endless Twitter Battle."""
22:34;22:42;"I don't like the title because the word ""desperate"" is already making you think something negative about Smash Mouth and what they do on Twitter."
22:42;22:52;"But I guess basically the article's about whoever runs the Smash Mouth Twitter account is like tweeting at people who say what they consider to be derogatory things
about Smash Mouth."
22:52;22:57;"It seems like most of them are about the fact that the song ""All Star,"" the one we were just singing,"
22:57;23:00;"""Somebody, somebody,"""
23:00;23:03;"was used in ""Shrek."""
23:03;23:04;"Okay."
23:04;23:09;"So you can imagine that for some kids, they associate that song with that movie."
23:09;23:10;"Sure."
23:10;23:11;"It happens."
23:11;23:15;"So like, for instance, somebody tweeted about ""All Star,"""
23:15;23:19;"""I want someone to tell me that the first thing they think of when they hear this song is NOT Shrek."""
23:19;23:22;"And then the crying, laughing emoji."
23:22;23:24;"And then Smash Mouth tweeted back at them,"
23:24;23:30;"""Well, we don't think that, since the song was already on its way to number one in every country in the world before the film was even finished."""
23:30;23:38;"I guess basically they don't like that people, that the association with Shrek has overshadowed the fact that that song was a hit in its own right."
23:38;23:46;"So they sold the song to the movie, but then they're resentful of people that remember the song from the movie."
23:46;23:49;"Well, but I guess people are also just trying to clown on them."
23:49;23:51;"So like, somebody tweeted them,"
23:51;23:53;"""Well, it's funny, it's Shrek. They should be clowned on."""
23:53;23:55;"Well, hold on. I don't know about that."
23:55;23:58;"Like, somebody tweeted, ""Your best known song is 'Because of Shrek.'"""
23:58;24:02;"And they wrote back, ""Oh, we didn't have a number one before Shrek was even thought of? Come on, Sammy."""
24:02;24:04;"The person who tweeted its name was Sam."
24:04;24:07;"And then somebody, ""Now I feel like people are just like, messing with them."""
24:07;24:12;"Like, somebody tweeted, ""How does it feel that your entire music career can be attributed to Shrek?"""
24:12;24:18;"And they wrote, ""News to us. We already had a number one hit with 'Walking on the Sun' and 'All Star' was already top ten before Shrek was released."""
24:18;24:21;"So that, you can understand why that one maybe got their goat."
24:21;24:22;"Sure."
24:22;24:25;"Somebody saying, ""How does it feel that your entire..."" 'Cause it's just not true. It's simply untrue."
24:25;24:26;"It's not true."
24:26;24:28;"They had a big hit on their first album, 'Walking on the Sun.'"
24:28;24:31;"[sings]"
24:31;24:34;"And then 'All Star' was like, a hit. It wasn't a hit because of Shrek."
24:34;24:36;"It was terrible, but it was a hit."
24:36;24:39;"I actually reached out to Steve from Smash Mouth."
24:39;24:43;"I had my manager reach out to his manager, see if we could get him on the show."
24:43;24:45;"Because, you know, I'm a guy in a band."
24:45;24:46;"Yeah."
24:46;24:50;"Well, I don't know if it's him who's tweeting this, but I relate to that."
24:50;24:51;"Sure."
24:51;24:56;"We've had songs and movies... There's a lot of people who know 'Vampire Weekend' because A-Punk is in 'Step Brothers.'"
24:56;24:58;"[plays 'Vampire Weekend' by A-Punk]"
24:58;25:02;"And I'll admit, we lucked out with that one. That was a big debate in the band."
25:02;25:04;"That's a cooler movie than Shrek."
25:04;25:05;"I mean, is it?"
25:05;25:09;"I'm a 39-year-old dude, so I haven't seen Shrek."
25:09;25:10;"Yeah, maybe one day..."
25:10;25:11;"I'm not interested in Shrek."
25:11;25:12;"Maybe one day you'll have kids."
25:12;25:13;"True."
25:13;25:15;"Are you going to let your 7-year-old watch 'Step Brothers?'"
25:15;25:16;"Maybe."
25:16;25:17;"[laughs]"
25:17;25:18;"No, I'm just kidding."
25:18;25:20;"People liked Shrek when it came out."
25:20;25:23;"I get it. I mean, people hate on your band. People hate on Smash Mouth."
25:23;25:26;"I can see you guys have something to talk about."
25:26;25:27;"You know..."
25:27;25:31;"Kind of mainstream-y bands that had songs and movies. People clown on you on that."
25:31;25:38;"And also, just like Smash Mouth, 'Vampire Weekend' has a sense of devil-may-care, fun summertime attitude."
25:38;25:40;"At least on our first album."
25:40;25:45;"You know what? Speaking of Smash Mouth, I want to return to Shrek in a moment, but this made me think of a story."
25:45;25:52;"That one time I was at a party, and a guy from a band from a similar era, a guy from Sugar Ray."
25:52;25:54;"And they were similar. They were like a SoCal band."
25:54;25:58;"And I always liked Sugar Ray. Like, honestly, they have a few great songs."
25:58;26:03;"And he came up to me at a party, and he's like, ""Oh, hey man, I just want to say I really like your band."""
26:03;26:04;"And I was like, ""Oh, thanks."""
26:04;26:05;"Is this the singer Mark?"
26:05;26:07;"Yeah, it's Mark. Mark came over and said he liked the band."
26:07;26:09;"And I was like, ""Oh, man."" And I was actually really psyched."
26:09;26:11;"I was like, ""Oh, that's really nice."""
26:11;26:17;"But then he said this self-deprecating thing along the lines of, ""Oh, but yeah, you're not trying to hear that from the dude from Sugar Ray."""
26:17;26:19;"Something about, ""Oh, but you probably don't like Sugar Ray."""
26:19;26:21;"And I was like, ""No, dude, I always liked Sugar Ray."""
26:21;26:22;"That's kind of touching."
26:22;26:27;"I mean, maybe I might say something like that to a certain artist that I expected might not like 'Vampire Weekend' or something."
26:27;26:36;"But I was thinking, these dudes from that late '90s era, they had the fortune and the misfortune of being at literally the height of the record industry."
26:36;26:38;"I think '99 was the height of the industry."
26:38;26:44;"So these guys who were probably dudes who grew up listening to punk rock and hip-hop."
26:44;26:45;"Sublime."
26:45;26:48;"Yeah, even before Sublime. They probably could have been Sublime."
26:48;26:54;"And then they come out at this moment where there's so much money, and they're on TRL and MTV."
26:54;26:58;"And maybe people didn't really give them a chance or something."
26:58;27:03;"I'll be honest. I was more into Sugar Ray than I was into Smash Mouth."
27:03;27:04;"I fully agreed on that."
27:04;27:05;"They have some great songs."
27:05;27:23;"I could see them being self-conscious of, ""Look, we made a ton of money. Deep down, we know we're not the greatest band on earth."""
27:23;27:25;"Our timing was great."
27:25;27:30;"But also, these days, people like elitists are more into pop music."
27:30;27:36;"Back then, if you were a band that went pop from a critical elitist perspective, you're dead."
27:36;27:41;"I was telling this story to somebody who used to work with Franz Ferdinand."
27:41;27:47;"And they told a similar story about the singer from 'Popper Roach' at a radio show coming over to Franz Ferdinand and being like,"
27:47;27:49;"""Oh, hey guys, I just want to say I love your record."""
27:49;27:51;"They're from Scotland. They have no idea who he is."
27:51;27:53;"And they were like, ""Oh, cool. What are you doing here?"""
27:53;27:55;"And he was like, ""Oh, my band's playing too."""
27:55;27:56;"And they were like, ""Oh, what's your band?"""
27:56;28:01;"And he kind of sheepishly was like, ""Oh, we're called 'Popper Roach.' I don't know. We're on the dole."""
28:01;28:02;"And they were like, ""Oh, cool."""
28:02;28:04;"And it was a similar thing."
28:04;28:09;"I felt like a lot of guys and bands from that era really had it raw."
28:09;28:14;"Because I feel like the dudes from 'Popper Roach' or some of the lesser dudes in Limp Bizkit,"
28:14;28:20;"you're just doing your thing and then you're getting blasted out to the country in such a huge way"
28:20;28:28;"that you probably share a lot of influences with the hipster people, the me's of the world."
28:28;28:30;"But then you have this, I don't know."
28:30;28:33;"Yeah, I mean, you're into Velvet Underground or punk rock or whatever,"
28:33;28:36;"and then all of a sudden you meet this guy named Fred Durst."
28:36;28:40;"You guys start a band. You're playing bass in Limp Bizkit."
28:40;28:43;"Deep down in your soul, you're like, ""I was playing in a band."""
28:43;28:45;"The gig kind of escalated quickly."
28:45;28:47;"Turns out Fred's a total douchebag."
28:47;28:52;"I wasn't going to take it there. I bet Fred Durst is kind of cool."
28:52;28:53;"He doesn't seem that dope."
28:53;28:56;"I think everybody should be assumed cool until proven otherwise."
28:56;29:09;"As your band escalates, it's almost like politics, and then it gets polarized."
29:33;29:39;"People who are incredibly loved and successful but are so traumatized by the haters."
29:39;29:41;"Because that's true of all these guys."
29:41;29:44;"A lot of people think they can clown on Smash Mouth or whatever."
29:44;29:47;"I don't know. I'll have to look through more of it."
29:47;29:50;"They can clown on these people because they had a huge hit, like they're untouchable,"
29:50;29:52;"but then these people are actually very sensitive about it."
29:52;29:54;"I mean, classic, classic story."
29:54;29:58;"But it's funny because maybe in 20 years people will be looking back and be like,"
29:58;30:01;"""Yo, Smash Mouth and Sugar Ray, that was cool."""
30:01;30:04;"But they hate all that hipster stuff that came after them."
30:04;30:05;"Pavement sucks."
30:05;30:06;"Yeah, pavement sucks."
30:06;30:07;"It's possible."
30:08;30:12;"But you know what's funny is, you know who the original dude who went pop"
30:12;30:13;"and got traumatized by the haters is?"
30:13;30:14;"Yep, I do."
30:14;30:15;"Who?"
30:15;30:16;"Phil Collins."
30:16;30:17;"Oh, yeah. We're on the same wavelength, man."
30:17;30:23;"So Phil Collins, he played in Genesis, like super heady prog rock."
30:23;30:25;"Joined in '72."
30:25;30:29;"He's playing drums. You've got Peter Gabriel putting on face paint, lead singer."
30:29;30:33;"And even then, Phil Collins plays drums on some of the early Brian Eno stuff."
30:33;30:34;"He was in the mix."
30:34;30:35;"Bowie and stuff."
30:35;30:37;"Yeah, Bowie. He was like a step away from Bowie."
30:37;30:38;"I'm sure he knew Bowie."
30:38;30:39;"Oh, sure."
30:39;30:43;"And then in the '80s he becomes a pop star."
30:43;30:47;"But first of all, his first hit single is ""In the Air Tonight,"""
30:47;30:51;"which in the '80s people almost tried to treat it like a joke."
30:51;30:53;"He did his kind of schmaltzy stuff."
30:53;30:56;"But even now a lot of people go back and listen to that '80s Phil Collins stuff"
30:56;30:58;"and be like, ""Yo, it's just good pop music. Great voice."""
30:58;31:00;"Very well written."
31:00;31:04;"And then you read some of these later articles where people are interviewing him."
31:04;31:06;"There's a Rolling Stone one a few years back."
31:06;31:09;"And this is a guy who's one of the biggest artists in the world."
31:09;31:10;"And they're interviewing him."
31:10;31:12;"They're kind of like, ""So, man, what have you been doing?"""
31:12;31:14;"He lives in Switzerland now."
31:14;31:17;"And he's like, ""I don't know. Sometimes I make music."
31:17;31:19;"I bet no one really wants to hear it."""
31:19;31:21;"And it's like, ""What are you talking about, man? You're huge."""
31:21;31:25;"And he was like, ""No, I know I'm a joke. I know people just hate me."""
31:25;31:26;"And this is like Phil Collins."
31:26;31:27;"It's so heavy."
31:27;31:28;"It's so sad."
31:28;31:31;"And it's also sad because there's a guy who was cool."
31:31;31:33;"Then he got huge."
31:33;31:40;"Then he was kind of like a punchline for a certain brand of kind of snarky music critic or music fan."
31:40;31:43;"Now we listen back to his music like it's classic."
31:43;31:44;"A lot of that music is great."
31:44;31:48;"In fact, the guys in Chromio--because they always loved Phil Collins."
31:48;31:50;"They're not really from the indie rock world."
31:50;31:53;"They're kind of more from this hip-hop, funky world."
31:53;31:55;"And they had this story about the first time they went to the U.K."
31:55;31:57;"and an enemy journalist was like, ""Who are some of your biggest influences?"""
31:57;31:59;"And they were like, ""Phil Collins."""
31:59;32:03;"Let's say this is like 2003, and the guy was just like, ""Come on."""
32:03;32:04;"That guy just thought it was a joke."
32:04;32:09;"These days, if a kid said they were influenced by Phil Collins, they'd be like, ""Yes, it was everybody."""
32:09;32:10;"But then it was still like a joke."
32:10;32:13;"You know, he has an autobiography coming out this fall."
32:13;32:14;"Collins does?"
32:14;32:15;"Yeah."
32:15;32:16;"Oh, that's going to be great."
32:16;32:17;"I'm really looking forward to that."
32:17;32:22;"This summer, Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel are sharing the bill at Hollywood Bowl."
32:22;32:23;"Maybe they'll play together."
32:23;32:24;"Maybe they'll do a song together."
32:24;32:26;"Who's going to open for who?"
32:26;32:27;"That's a tough one."
32:27;32:28;"You're probably going to flip a coin."
32:28;32:30;"Can you imagine them hogging it out?"
32:30;32:31;"No, I bet."
32:31;32:35;"Peter Gabriel left Genesis in 1975, which is so early."
32:35;32:40;"And then imagine their relationship in the mid-'80s, when Phil was at the height of his pop stardom."
32:40;32:42;"And actually, so was Peter Gabriel."
32:42;32:45;"They were both huge stars, but Peter Gabriel was--"
32:45;32:49;"Peter Gabriel was probably getting Rolling Stone, Album of the Year."
32:49;32:51;"He had ""In Your Eyes,"" but he was still like,"
32:51;32:55;"""In your eyes, the light, the heat."""
32:55;33:00;"So you could imagine that back then, Phil Collins was like, ""Oh, Peter Gabriel."
33:00;33:01;"Oh, you think you're cooler than that?"""
33:01;33:02;"He was the cool kid."
33:02;33:03;"Yeah, Peter Gabriel."
33:03;33:06;"And now it's like they're just two older--"
33:06;33:07;"Pushing 70."
33:07;33:09;"--bald British men."
33:09;33:10;"You know what else that kind of makes me think of?"
33:10;33:14;"We're really jumping around today, but did you read Keith Richards' book?"
33:14;33:15;"Parts of it."
33:15;33:17;"So it's a very long book."
33:17;33:18;"Yeah."
33:18;33:19;"I'm amazed that I read the whole thing."
33:19;33:21;"There's a part where he talks about--"
33:21;33:25;"So you know, in the '60s, for a lot of people, you defined yourself by"
33:25;33:27;"if you liked the Stones or the Beatles."
33:27;33:28;"Sure."
33:28;33:31;"For a certain type of probably young American kid."
33:31;33:32;"Yeah."
33:32;33:34;"Some people thought the Beatles were safe, and if you were a badass,"
33:34;33:35;"you liked the Stones."
33:35;33:38;"And they had a friendly rivalry or something."
33:38;33:42;"There's a part where he's talking about being in the Caribbean,"
33:42;33:45;"like he's in Jamaica or something, and he rented some massive villa."
33:45;33:49;"And then he's like, ""And then I realized that the guy next door"
33:49;33:52;"renting the villa next to me was Paul McCartney."""
33:52;33:54;"And I just went over and I said, ""What's up, man?"""
33:54;33:57;"And these are guys who probably were fairly rival,"
33:57;34:00;"envious of each other back in the day."
34:00;34:02;"And he's like, ""And we just ended up hanging out every day."
34:02;34:04;"We'd just take long walks and reminisce about back in the day."""
34:04;34:06;"Is this in the '70s or the '80s?"
34:06;34:08;"No, this is in 2003."
34:08;34:09;"Wow."
34:09;34:11;"Because you just picture these dudes who maybe at some point"
34:11;34:13;"represented polar opposites."
34:13;34:14;"Sure."
34:14;34:16;"And so we look at them, we're like, ""What are you talking about?"
34:16;34:17;"Polar opposite the Beatles?"""
34:17;34:19;"It's like dad music."
34:19;34:20;"It's like ham and eggs."
34:20;34:22;"Yeah, they go together."
34:22;34:26;"So I'm just picturing Keith and Paul McCartney just taking long walks"
34:26;34:28;"on the beach and just being like--"
34:28;34:30;"And especially when you consider at that age,"
34:30;34:32;"it's like how many of their friends are dead."
34:32;34:33;"Yeah."
34:33;34:36;"Even the main dudes, John Lennon, George Harrison,"
34:36;34:38;"and these two dudes are left."
34:38;34:41;"I'm sure at that age, hopefully the similarities bond you together more."
34:41;34:42;"Yeah."
34:42;34:45;"I just take a picture with these dudes who've had problems in our era,"
34:45;34:47;"like Drake and Meek Mill."
34:47;34:50;"Just flash forward 50 years, Drake and Meek Mill,"
34:50;34:52;"like Nicki Minaj married somebody--"
34:52;34:56;"I'm not trying to cast doubt on the strength of their relationship."
34:56;34:57;"How dare you?"
34:57;34:59;"Let's imagine this, like Nicki Minaj isn't even in the picture anymore,"
34:59;35:02;"and it's like they just see their rooms are next to each other in Vegas,"
35:02;35:05;"and it's just kind of like, ""What's up, man?"""
35:05;35:07;"And it's like, ""Hey, man, you want to go hit the buffet?"""
35:07;35:09;"Yeah, man, time does that."
35:09;35:10;"Yeah."
35:10;35:12;"I think about the kind of awkward moment in the conversation"
35:12;35:15;"between Paul and Keith, and the conversation kind of peters out,"
35:15;35:19;"and then one of them's just like, ""Yeah, I don't know, anyway."""
35:19;35:22;"Just like trying to--what else?"
35:22;35:25;"""You want to get a drink? You want to come inside, man?"""
35:25;35:29;"""Hey, I'm beat, man. I'm going to turn in."""
35:29;35:34;"Keith is like, ""Yeah, I have to go FaceTime my daughter."""
35:34;35:36;"""Go FaceTime my great-grandchild."""
35:36;35:38;"Or just like the two of them sitting at a table together,"
35:38;35:40;"texting."
35:40;35:42;"Right."
35:42;35:44;"Oh, God."
35:44;35:47;"Well, on that note, who do you like better, the Beatles or the Stones?"
35:47;35:48;"You know what's funny, man?"
35:48;35:50;"I mean, when I was a kid, it was all about the Beatles."
35:50;35:51;"Right."
35:51;35:52;"And now I'm like late 30s."
35:52;35:54;"I listen to the Stones more."
35:54;35:56;"Yeah? What's your favorite Stones song?"
35:56;35:58;"Probably ""Tumbling Dice."""
35:58;35:59;"""Tumbling Dice."""
35:59;36:00;"I say ""die."""
36:00;36:04;"I think people say ""dice,"" ""dice,"" or ""die."""
36:04;36:07;"Well, the song is--it's called ""Tumbling Dice."""
36:07;36:09;"Yeah, but people say ""Tumbling Die."""
36:09;36:11;"Because--is that how he sings it?"
36:11;36:12;"Maybe. I think so."
36:12;36:14;"You got to roll me."
36:14;36:18;"Call me the Tumbling Dice."
36:18;36:19;"I don't know."
36:19;36:20;"""Die."""
36:20;36:21;"Because ""die"" is plural?"
36:21;36:22;"""Die"" is plural."
36:22;36:26;"Well, I guess it would be weird for one man to describe himself as plural."
36:26;36:27;"I love that song."
36:27;36:29;"Anyway, the early '70s Stones stuff is--"
36:29;36:30;"It's a great song."
36:30;36:31;"That's where I'm at."

48:06;48:12;"Music's so hot, it'll melt your face off."
48:12;48:15;"- This is Jake's NRA segment."
48:15;48:17;"So NRA describes itself as America's"
48:17;48:19;"longest running civil rights organization."
48:19;48:20;"- Yeah."
48:20;48:21;"- Most people that I roll with don't describe"
48:21;48:23;"the NRA as a civil rights organization,"
48:23;48:24;"but interesting. - No, I know."
48:24;48:26;"- All right, so what'd you learn about the NRA?"
48:26;48:28;"Because that is something that, unfortunately,"
48:28;48:32;"a lot of us who kind of just follow the news,"
48:32;48:34;"another mass shooting, we feel awful."
48:34;48:35;"- Right."
48:35;48:37;"- This debate flares up."
48:37;48:38;"It happens over and over again."
48:38;48:40;"The NRA comes, NRA goes, but it's like,"
48:40;48:41;"yeah, weirdly I don't know that much"
48:41;48:43;"about the NRA's history."
48:43;48:44;"- Right."
48:44;48:46;"So yeah, like I said, they are self-proclaimed"
48:46;48:49;"the longest standing civil rights organization"
48:49;48:50;"in the US."
48:50;48:53;"They were founded in 1871 in New York"
48:53;48:56;"by a bunch of Civil War veterans."
48:56;48:57;"- Union, Union vets."
48:57;49:00;"- Yeah, and they were dismayed by the terrible"
49:00;49:04;"marksmanship of the Union soldiers during the war."
49:04;49:07;"And one of the founders of the NRA,"
49:07;49:08;"there's a quote, he's like,"
49:08;49:10;"out of 10 soldiers, only one knew how to use"
49:10;49:13;"the sight on his rifle, and only one could hit"
49:13;49:14;"the broadside of a barn."
49:14;49:16;"So these dudes are like, let's start an advocacy"
49:16;49:20;"group for competency with weapons and marksmanship."
49:20;49:22;"So their first lobbying effort is to get"
49:22;49:24;"25 grand from the New York State Legislature"
49:24;49:27;"to build a range to learn how to shoot."
49:27;49:29;"And then that's what the vibe is for a long time."
49:29;49:33;"And then the first major federal firearms laws"
49:33;49:37;"are passed in the 20th century in 1934."
49:37;49:39;"And the NRA is like fully on board."
49:39;49:42;"And it's coming out of all the gangster stuff"
49:42;49:44;"that was happening in the Prohibition era,"
49:44;49:46;"like Al Capone."
49:46;49:50;"And so there's the National Firearms Act of 1934."
49:50;49:52;"And basically weapons are divided into two categories,"
49:52;49:53;"Title I, Title II."
49:53;49:56;"Title I is like hunting rifles and shotguns."
49:56;49:58;"Title II is like sawed-off shotguns,"
49:58;50:00;"machine guns, silencers, things like that."
50:00;50:03;"- Weapons of war, weapons designed to kill lots of people."
50:03;50:07;"- Right, they're not banned, but they're heavily regulated,"
50:07;50:09;"and they're under the jurisdiction of the ATF,"
50:09;50:12;"the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms."
50:12;50:14;"They put a $200 tax on the guns,"
50:14;50:17;"which in that day was equivalent to $3,500."
50:17;50:20;"So it was like prohibitively expensive to buy a gun."
50:20;50:22;"That sort of chilled stuff out for a while."
50:22;50:26;"The next major chapter in gun control was 1968,"
50:26;50:29;"which is a classic year on this show."
50:29;50:32;"- Oh, 1968, watershed year in American history."
50:32;50:35;"- Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Gun Control Act,"
50:35;50:39;"which came in the wake of the assassination of John F. Kennedy,"
50:39;50:42;"and then Malcolm X, and then Martin Luther King,"
50:42;50:44;"and then Robert Kennedy."
50:44;50:48;"The gun that was used to kill JFK was purchased by mail order"
50:48;50:52;"from an NRA magazine called American Rifleman."
50:52;50:54;"And so at that point--"
50:54;50:56;"- That's not a good look for the NRA."
50:56;50:57;"- No, that's rough."
50:57;50:59;"So the president of the NRA at that time was like,"
50:59;51:01;"""We do not think any sane American can object to placing"
51:01;51:03;"""into this bill the instrument which killed"
51:03;51:05;"""the president of the United States."""
51:05;51:08;"So he's on board with like, ""We gotta ban mail-order guns,"
51:08;51:11;"""and we have to prohibit felons and people found"
51:11;51:13;"""mentally incompetent from buying guns."""
51:13;51:15;"- So in other words, he's basically like,"
51:15;51:17;"""Yes, it should be harder to get a gun."
51:17;51:19;"""Clearly it is too easy."
51:19;51:21;"""Somebody ordered a gun and killed the president."
51:21;51:23;"""It is too easy to get a gun."""
51:23;51:25;"This is the head of the NRA in 1968."
51:25;51:26;"- Yeah, that passes."
51:26;51:29;"But there is a seed within the NRA that starts to emerge"
51:29;51:33;"that's very upset by the Gun Control Act of 1968."
51:33;51:37;"So in the 1970s, the tone that we know the NRA"
51:37;51:39;"kind of has today is established."
51:39;51:40;"It's firmly established."
51:40;51:44;"The NRA is really split about the Gun Control Act of '68."
51:44;51:46;"The leadership is like all on board,"
51:46;51:48;"but there's a lot of dissidence within the organization"
51:48;51:49;"that hate it."
51:49;51:51;"A lot of the organization's leaders think they should"
51:51;51:53;"just continue to have the organization promote"
51:53;51:54;"marksmanship and hunting."
51:54;51:56;"They want to move the headquarters to Colorado"
51:56;51:58;"and set up like a big hunting range."
51:58;52:00;"And there's this other group that's like,"
52:00;52:02;"""No, we want to set up shop in D.C."
52:02;52:04;"""and advocate against gun control."""
52:04;52:05;"- Right."
52:05;52:09;"- So in the 1970s, there's a bill going through the Congress"
52:09;52:12;"that's going to ban guns called Saturday Night Specials,"
52:12;52:14;"which are like cheap, inexpensive handguns."
52:14;52:15;"- Small guns."
52:15;52:18;"- Yeah, sort of like your classic 1970s stick-up man,"
52:18;52:19;"like out of Dirty Harry or something."
52:19;52:20;"- Right."
52:20;52:21;"- Like just a crappy pistol."
52:21;52:22;"- Yeah."
52:22;52:24;"- Now, the bill is criticized for having kind of racist"
52:24;52:27;"overtones because it was a gun very prevalent"
52:27;52:29;"in the inner city, which was predominantly black."
52:29;52:30;"- Right."
52:30;52:31;"- But it's a very popular bill."
52:31;52:34;"- Yeah, and it's a very popular bill."
52:34;52:35;"- And it's a very popular bill."
52:52;52:59;"- He was actually, in 1931, convicted of murdering a 15-year-old Mexican-American kid by shooting"
52:59;53:01;"him in the chest with a shotgun."
53:01;53:05;"But the conviction was overturned shortly thereafter by the Texas Court of Appeals, and"
53:05;53:08;"the judge wasn't up and up with the jury."
53:08;53:15;"The 1977 NRA convention in Cincinnati, Harlan Carter is able to oust Maxwell Rich, who was"
53:15;53:18;"the kind-vibed Mormon."
53:18;53:22;"And he comes out hard, and he's just like, ""We can win it on a simple concept."
53:22;53:24;"No compromise, no gun legislation."""
53:24;53:29;"And he famously is quoted as saying, ""The use of guns by violent criminals and the mentally"
53:29;53:34;"ill is the price we pay for freedom,"" which is like a classic, a classic..."
53:34;53:35;"- Rewind."
53:35;53:38;"Let me hear that again."
53:38;53:43;"- The use of guns by violent criminals and the mentally ill is the price we pay for freedom."
53:43;53:45;"- It's basically like the extremists took over."
53:45;53:46;"- In the mid-'70s, yeah."
53:46;53:48;"And so right around then is when the lobbying..."
53:48;53:51;"They weren't even a lobbying organization until then."
53:51;53:53;"So this dude, Harlan Carter, changes the tone."
53:53;53:54;"- A murderer."
53:54;53:58;"- With his insurrection, the lobbying arm is established."
53:58;54:02;"1980, Reagan is the first presidential candidate to get an endorsement by the NRA."
54:02;54:05;"Until 1980, they were just not even involved."
54:05;54:09;"Two months after he's inaugurated, he's shot by John Hinckley in that shooting."
54:09;54:10;"And then Harlan Carter weighs in."
54:10;54:11;"There's a quote here."
54:11;54:15;"He's like, ""You know, sadly, why President Reagan isn't here, but you heard President"
54:15;54:19;"Reagan himself advocate no restriction on those who commit no crimes."
54:19;54:24;"He rejected the maudlin enticements of the press to say something in favor of gun control"
54:24;54:25;"while he lay wounded."""
54:25;54:26;"So he's just like, ""Reagan's a tough guy."
54:26;54:31;"Even though he got shot, he's not gonna stoop to the level of the press and maybe talk about"
54:31;54:32;"gun control."""
54:32;54:35;"In the '80s, the NRA is fully mainstream."
54:35;54:37;"The membership more than triples."
54:37;54:39;"Their fundraising goes through the roof."
54:39;54:42;"And sort of the vibe that we know today is firmly entrenched."
54:42;54:46;"And from there on out, it's sort of like a seesaw battle of progressive politicians trying"
54:46;54:48;"to pass some gun control legislation."
54:48;54:53;"And then the NRA filing lawsuits in various states that they might be receptive to."
54:53;54:59;"And sort of trying to squash those new laws by having the courts sort of go one way or"
54:59;55:00;"the other."
55:00;55:03;"A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm."
55:03;55:09;"A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm."
55:09;55:13;"He changed his clothes and shined his boots and combed his dark hair down."
55:13;55:18;"And his mother cried as he walked out."
55:18;55:20;"Don't take your guns to town, son."
55:20;55:24;"Leave your guns at home, Bill."
55:24;55:26;"Don't take your guns to town."
55:26;55:28;"Reading about this stuff, it just like mushrooms out."
55:28;55:32;"There's just like so many laws that sort of almost happen."
55:32;55:38;"In the wake of yet another horrendous mass shooting, you see people throwing out statistics."
55:38;55:41;"I haven't independently verified these, but you know, like a huge percentage of Americans,"
55:41;55:45;"a vast majority, want stricter controls on guns."
55:45;55:50;"So you would imagine there's probably a lot of NRA members who maybe gun ownership is"
55:50;55:53;"important to them, but wouldn't probably don't have an AR-15 at home."
55:53;55:54;"Yeah, absolutely."
55:54;55:58;"I mean, like the moderate voices are going to be quiet."
55:58;55:59;"It gets hard to talk about."
55:59;56:05;"It'd be one thing if the discourse was like, hey, should like a suburban parent have a"
56:05;56:08;"little handgun in a lockbox in their closet?"
56:08;56:10;"Like it'd be one thing if that's what the debate was."
56:10;56:13;"But like the debate is literally about weapons of war."
56:13;56:15;"Easy, semi-automatic weapons."
56:15;56:16;"Yeah."
56:16;56:17;"All right."
56:17;56:22;"Well, Jake, the way forward in terms of sensible gun control in this country is complicated,"
56:22;56:27;"but at the very least, we appreciate you digging in the crates and giving us some context on"
56:27;56:28;"the history of the NRA."
56:28;56:29;"So thank you for that."
56:29;56:32;"Let's listen to some music to kind of cleanse our palates."
56:32;56:37;"What's like the opposite of a brutal song about gun violence?"
56:37;56:39;"You are the sunshine of my life."
56:39;56:40;"What song is that?"
56:40;56:43;"You are the sunshine of my life."
56:43;56:44;"By who?"
56:44;56:45;"Stevie Wonder."
56:45;56:46;"Life, not love."
56:46;56:47;"Sorry."
56:47;56:48;"Oh, Sunshine of My Life."
56:48;56:49;"Okay."
56:49;56:50;"That's a good idea."
56:50;56:51;"Here is Stevie Wonder with You're the Sunshine of My Life."
56:51;56:52;"You are the sunshine of my life."
56:52;56:53;"That's why I'll always be around."
56:53;56:54;"You are the anvil of my life."
57:05;57:29;"You are the anvil of my life."
57:29;57:50;"You are the anvil of my life."
57:50;58:19;"You are the anvil of my life."
58:19;58:20;"You are the anvil of my life."
59:20;59:24;"Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis"
59:53;01:00:01;"My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine."
01:00:01;01:00:08;"Everybody loves the sunshine."
01:00:08;01:00:13;"Sunshine."
01:00:13;01:00:20;"Everybody loves the sunshine."
01:00:20;01:00:24;"Sunshine."
01:00:24;01:00:28;"Folks get down in the sunshine."
01:00:28;01:00:32;"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"Sunshine."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"Yeah."
01:00:36;01:00:49;"Folks get brown in the sunshine."
01:00:49;01:01:11;"Just bees and things and flowers."
01:01:11;01:01:28;"My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine."
01:01:28;01:01:35;"Everybody loves the sunshine."
01:01:35;01:01:40;"Sunshine."
01:01:40;01:01:47;"Everybody loves the sunshine."
01:01:47;01:01:51;"Sunshine."
01:01:51;01:01:59;"Folks get down in the sunshine."
01:01:59;01:02:03;"Sunshine."
01:02:03;01:02:23;"Folks get proud in the sunshine."
01:02:23;01:02:35;"Feel what I feel when I feel what I feel when I'm feeling in the sunshine."
01:02:47;01:02:59;"Do what I do when I do what I do when I'm doing in the sunshine."
01:02:59;01:03:07;"Do what I do when I do what I do when I'm doing in the sunshine."
01:03:07;01:03:31;"Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy."
01:03:31;01:03:44;"Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry."
01:03:44;01:03:58;"Sunshine on the water looks so lovely."
01:03:58;01:04:12;"Sunshine almost always makes me high."
01:04:12;01:04:25;"If I had a day that I could give you,"
01:04:25;01:04:38;"I'd give to you a day just like today."
01:04:38;01:04:52;"If I had a song that I could sing for you,"
01:04:52;01:05:04;"I'd sing a song to make you feel this way."
01:05:04;01:05:17;"Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy."
01:05:17;01:05:30;"Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry."
01:05:30;01:05:43;"Sunshine on the water looks so lovely."
01:05:43;01:05:57;"Sunshine almost always makes me high."
01:05:57;01:06:11;"If I had a tale that I could tell you,"
01:06:11;01:06:24;"I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile."
01:06:24;01:06:37;"If I had a wish that I could wish for you,"
01:06:37;01:06:49;"I'd make a wish for sunshine all the while."
01:06:49;01:07:02;"Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy."
01:07:02;01:07:16;"Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry."
01:07:16;01:07:29;"Sunshine on the water looks so lovely."
01:07:29;01:07:42;"Sunshine almost always makes me high."
01:07:42;01:07:55;"Sunshine almost all the time makes me high."
01:07:55;01:08:12;"Sunshine almost always."
01:08:12;01:08:14;"So that was a grip of songs,"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"all with a kind of positive theme,"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"something on a lighter note."
01:08:18;01:08:22;"In dark times, it's important to have some positive music."
01:08:22;01:08:26;"So we're going to do, only when we really have our together,"
01:08:26;01:08:29;"do we do the double top five."
01:08:29;01:08:30;"I love it."
01:08:30;01:08:37;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:08:37;01:08:38;"So people know that every show,"
01:08:38;01:08:41;"we always do at least the top five songs on iTunes."
01:08:41;01:08:42;"Yeah."
01:08:42;01:08:43;"But the double top five,"
01:08:43;01:08:45;"these are good for shows when it's just you and me."
01:08:45;01:08:50;"Just two dudes, two brews, it's going head to head."
01:08:50;01:08:54;"And this is where we compare the top five songs of today"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"with the top five songs of another year."
01:08:56;01:08:58;"And this week we picked 1968."
01:08:58;01:09:02;"So we're going to compare and contrast 2016 with 1968."
01:09:02;01:09:05;"So 1968 for our younger listeners"
01:09:05;01:09:08;"or our listeners who don't care about history,"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"why was that such an important year in American history?"
01:09:10;01:09:15;"We talked a little bit about the Gun Control Act of 1968."
01:09:15;01:09:16;"What else was happening in '68?"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"I guess, was '68 the summer of love or was that '67?"
01:09:18;01:09:19;"'67."
01:09:19;01:09:21;"'68 was the year after the summer of love."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"I mean, '68's coming up a lot this year"
01:09:23;01:09:25;"because of how crazy the elections are"
01:09:25;01:09:28;"and people are anticipating demonstrations and whatnot"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"at these conventions upcoming this summer."
01:09:30;01:09:31;"Right."
01:09:31;01:09:32;"Things got really crazy."
01:09:32;01:09:33;"The cops started beating people"
01:09:33;01:09:35;"outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago."
01:09:35;01:09:36;"Right."
01:09:36;01:09:38;"It's sort of looked at as just generally"
01:09:38;01:09:41;"a very tumultuous year in the history of America."
01:09:41;01:09:42;"Yeah."
01:09:42;01:09:43;"Martin Luther King was killed."
01:09:43;01:09:44;"Robert Kennedy was killed."
01:09:44;01:09:46;"There were riots nationwide"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"following the assassination of Martin Luther King."
01:09:48;01:09:50;"Richard Nixon was elected."
01:09:50;01:09:52;"The Vietnam War was at its height."
01:09:52;01:09:54;"I feel like it's a year that's sort of in the ether."
01:09:54;01:09:55;"Right."
01:09:55;01:09:56;"Another tumultuous year."
01:09:56;01:09:58;"We did this a few weeks ago."
01:09:58;01:10:01;"It was really funny because all the songs on the top five in '68"
01:10:01;01:10:03;"were like the most lame."
01:10:03;01:10:04;"Bubble gum."
01:10:04;01:10:05;"Just totally."
01:10:05;01:10:06;"Well, let's see what we got."
01:10:06;01:10:11;"So we're going to start with the number five song of 1968"
01:10:11;01:10:14;"and this was MacArthur Park by Richard Harris."
01:10:14;01:10:16;"[playing ""MacArthur Park""]"
01:10:16;01:10:19;"This week of June of 1968."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"This is a good song."
01:10:20;01:10:21;"It's a weird song."
01:10:21;01:10:23;"I know this one."
01:10:23;01:10:25;"Someone left the cake out in the rain."
01:10:25;01:10:28;"Oh, really?"
01:10:28;01:10:31;"Just picture this, just like dark time in America."
01:10:31;01:10:33;"This is on the radio."
01:10:33;01:10:37;"Spring was never waiting for us, girl"
01:10:37;01:10:45;"It ran one step ahead as we followed in the dance"
01:10:45;01:10:50;"It's like--"
01:10:50;01:10:56;"Between the parted pages and the prayer still robs our fevered eyes"
01:10:56;01:10:57;"It's eerie."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"It's a spooky song."
01:10:58;01:11:01;"It's like a real Beatles-y chord progression but--"
01:11:01;01:11:03;"With a little bit of like game show--"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"Yeah."
01:11:05;01:11:06;"L.A. orchestration."
01:11:06;01:11:07;"Yeah."
01:11:07;01:11:10;"MacArthur Park is melting through the dark"
01:11:10;01:11:14;"All the sweet green icing flowing down"
01:11:14;01:11:15;"Sweet green icing."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"Way overproduced."
01:11:17;01:11:22;"I don't think that I can take it"
01:11:22;01:11:25;"'Cause it took so long to bake it"
01:11:25;01:11:28;"I never had that recipe at the end"
01:11:28;01:11:31;"What is this about?"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"It's about--"
01:11:32;01:11:33;"He's baking a cake?"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"I remember my parents would talk about this as like--"
01:11:35;01:11:36;"Really?"
01:11:36;01:11:39;"As like this super weird song that they like kind of hated."
01:11:39;01:11:41;"The chorus goes--"
01:11:41;01:11:44;"It's something about the green icing and then it goes--"
01:11:44;01:11:47;"Someone left the cake out in the rain"
01:11:47;01:11:48;"And he goes--"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"And I don't think I can take it"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"'Cause it took so long to bake it"
01:11:52;01:11:55;"And I'll never have the recipe again"
01:11:55;01:11:57;"It's a weird song."
01:11:57;01:11:58;"Are we supposed to be fired up by that?"
01:11:58;01:11:59;"I don't know."
01:11:59;01:12:00;"Someone left a cake out in the rain."
01:12:00;01:12:01;"We could look at--"
01:12:01;01:12:05;"Maybe the cake is a metaphor for a relationship or for America."
01:12:05;01:12:07;"Could be, man."
01:12:07;01:12:08;"Someone left the--"
01:12:08;01:12:09;"You know, it's funny."
01:12:09;01:12:10;"Could be."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"I'm on the radio right now called ""Cake by the Ocean."""
01:12:12;01:12:13;"What's that?"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"Actually, somebody told me that--"
01:12:15;01:12:17;"Somebody that I know in the songwriting community told me"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"that it's about eating it by the ocean."
01:12:19;01:12:20;"Eating cake?"
01:12:20;01:12:22;"Yeah."
01:12:22;01:12:24;"That's what the songwriter claims."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"I don't think that I can take it"
01:12:26;01:12:29;"'Cause it took so long to bake it"
01:12:29;01:12:34;"And I'll never have the recipe again"
01:12:34;01:12:47;"It's a weird song."
01:12:47;01:12:49;"That was a spooky song, but kind of, yeah, weird."
01:12:49;01:12:52;"Like, I don't know, the tone of that song is so weird."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"So what's the counterpart right now?"
01:12:54;01:12:55;"It's the Chainsmokers."
01:12:55;01:12:58;"2016 is the Chainsmokers with ""Don't Let Me Down,"""
01:12:58;01:13:03;"featuring Dea."
01:13:03;01:13:04;"It's a Dylan Colley vibe."
01:13:04;01:13:08;"The Chainsmokers, they're kind of like EDM producers, DJs."
01:13:08;01:13:09;"Uh-huh."

01:13:22;01:13:25;"It's got that early XX guitar."

01:13:46;01:13:49;"Yeah, like, it's gonna come up, wait."

01:14:07;01:14:11;"Uh, there were breaks."

01:14:21;01:14:24;"The drop is like then the next part's usually half time."

01:14:25;01:14:28;"The drop as people refer to it now"
01:14:28;01:14:32;"probably was within the past ten years like dubstep kind of--"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"I mean, there's been builds and--"
01:14:34;01:14:35;"Yeah, crescendos."
01:14:35;01:14:39;"And riffs and breakdowns in especially dance music forever."
01:14:39;01:14:42;"But like the real drop is--"
01:14:42;01:14:45;"And you know within like the second measure"
01:14:45;01:14:46;"of like, oh, there's a drop coming."
01:14:46;01:14:51;"And usually lately the drop is like it contrasts the previous part."

01:35:53;01:35:55;"Are you gonna go see Finding Dory?"
01:35:55;01:35:56;"What's that? No."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"It's the sequel to Finding Nemo?"
01:35:58;01:35:59;"No."
01:35:59;01:36:00;"Are you?"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"Well, I never actually saw Finding Nemo."

01:36:30;01:36:32;"You've had a few."
01:36:32;01:36:34;"Yeah, why not?"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"It's fun. It's like a little funky,"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"a little Motown."
01:36:38;01:36:40;"So, that was the top five songs"
01:36:40;01:36:43;"of 2016 and 1968."
01:36:43;01:36:45;"Who's winning?"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"I think on average, 2016 was better."
01:36:47;01:36:48;"Nah, I'm gonna go '68."
01:36:48;01:36:51;"I'm gonna go ""Yummy in My Tummy."""

01:36:52;01:36:53;"Mrs. Robinson."

01:36:56;01:36:58;"I'm going '68."
01:36:58;01:37:00;"Yeah, this is not the strongest top five."
01:37:00;01:37:01;"2016 sucked this year."
01:37:01;01:37:03;"It didn't suck."
01:37:03;01:37:05;"I don't think it sucked."
01:37:05;01:37:07;"It bit, man."
01:37:07;01:37:09;"You think it bit?"
01:37:09;01:37:12;"Damn, strong words coming from Drake."
01:37:12;01:37:13;"I mean, ""Can't Stop the Feeling""--"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"Wait, what was the highlight from 2016? Come on."
01:37:15;01:37:16;"I guess the Drake song."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:37:17;01:37:19;"I kind of like the Chainsmokers song."
01:37:19;01:37:20;"I like that it's got that--"

01:37:33;01:37:36;"It's product to put in a slot that needs something in it."
01:37:36;01:37:38;"Well, I love to see market efficiency,"
01:37:38;01:37:41;"so I don't want to see product slots empty."
01:37:41;01:37:44;"All right, that wraps up the five by five,"
01:37:44;01:37:47;"the top ten, the top five by--"

01:44:39;01:44:45;"#"
01:44:45;01:44:47;"Welcome back to Time Crisis."
01:44:47;01:44:49;"Okay, I think we did our thing, man."
01:44:49;01:44:50;"Wait, so you've done four screens?"
01:44:50;01:44:51;"What?"
01:44:51;01:44:52;"You've done four screens?"
01:44:52;01:44:53;"Am I a four screener?"
01:44:53;01:44:54;"Yeah, have you done it?"
01:44:54;01:44:55;"Oh, absolutely."
01:44:55;01:44:58;"No, not double laptop, although I do own two laptops,"
01:44:58;01:44:59;"if you're interested."
01:44:59;01:45:02;"If anybody at home thought that I was the kind of guy"
01:45:02;01:45:03;"who only has one laptop..."
01:45:03;01:45:05;"You're doing double."
01:45:05;01:45:07;"I could do five screens."
01:45:07;01:45:09;"But seriously, what's your max?"
01:45:09;01:45:10;"Let's be serious here."
01:45:10;01:45:13;"Seriously, I've definitely done four screens"
01:45:13;01:45:15;"because I have the TV on."
01:45:15;01:45:18;"Obviously something I'm not super invested in."
01:45:18;01:45:20;"CNN on mute."
01:45:20;01:45:22;"Yeah, CNN and some garbage like that."
01:45:22;01:45:24;"And then I got the laptop,"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"I got the phone mostly for texting."
01:45:26;01:45:28;"And I know there's, like, you know some people"
01:45:28;01:45:30;"text on their laptop all the time now?"
01:45:30;01:45:31;"I'll do that."
01:45:31;01:45:32;"Really, you do that?"
01:45:32;01:45:33;"I like it."
01:45:33;01:45:34;"Oh, that's funny."
01:45:34;01:45:35;"I wouldn't take you for that."
01:45:35;01:45:36;"Well, see, it turns a three-screen situation"
01:45:36;01:45:37;"into a two-screen."
01:45:37;01:45:38;"I'm very traditional."
01:45:38;01:45:39;"I only text on my phone."
01:45:39;01:45:41;"Okay, now here's when I do four screens."
01:45:41;01:45:43;"You got something lightweight on the TV."
01:45:43;01:45:44;"You got the phone."
01:45:44;01:45:45;"You're texting."
01:45:45;01:45:46;"Yep."
01:45:46;01:45:47;"Or WhatsApping."
01:45:47;01:45:49;"No, I just text."
01:45:49;01:45:51;"I'm texting on the phone."
01:45:51;01:45:52;"Then on the computer,"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"maybe I'm, like, got my email open,"
01:45:54;01:45:55;"like, full screen,"
01:45:55;01:45:58;"or maybe I'm on Twitter or something."
01:45:58;01:46:00;"And then maybe finally on the iPad,"
01:46:00;01:46:02;"I read books on my iPad."
01:46:02;01:46:04;"So maybe I might have a book open"
01:46:04;01:46:05;"to cross-reference."
01:46:05;01:46:06;"Really?"
01:46:06;01:46:07;"Or I might just have, like,"
01:46:07;01:46:08;"yet another thing on the iPad."
01:46:08;01:46:09;"Here's one."
01:46:09;01:46:11;"If, let's say, the CNN was on mute,"
01:46:11;01:46:14;"maybe I'd be playing music off the iPad."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"Okay."
01:46:15;01:46:17;"And then, you know, occasionally checking in."
01:46:17;01:46:19;"So you're playing the troll soundtrack on the iPad."
01:46:19;01:46:20;"Troll soundtrack on the iPad."
01:46:20;01:46:21;"CNN on mute."
01:46:21;01:46:24;"CNN on mute on the boob tube."
01:46:24;01:46:25;"Texting with your mom."
01:46:25;01:46:27;"Texting with my mom."
01:46:27;01:46:31;"And then tweeting at my mom on the laptop."
01:46:31;01:46:33;"Tweeting at Smash Mouth."
01:46:35;01:46:37;"Wait, there was something that came up in the top five"
01:46:37;01:46:38;"that I want to say before we wrapped up."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"Oh, yeah, Shania Twain came up briefly"
01:46:39;01:46:42;"because we were talking about Mutt Lang."
01:46:42;01:46:43;"This is a fun fact for people at home."
01:46:43;01:46:45;"This is something I think about a lot."
01:46:45;01:46:47;"So we mentioned earlier in the show"
01:46:47;01:46:49;"that Phil Collins is a resident of Switzerland."
01:46:49;01:46:50;"Yeah."
01:46:50;01:46:51;"I haven't heard anybody on Blast."
01:46:51;01:46:53;"I think the primary reason"
01:46:53;01:46:55;"that a lot of wealthy people live in Switzerland"
01:46:55;01:46:58;"is just because of the natural majesty"
01:46:58;01:47:01;"of the Alps and the lakes."
01:47:01;01:47:04;"The fact that you can kind of get out of paying taxes there"
01:47:04;01:47:06;"I think is pretty low on the priority list of people."
01:47:06;01:47:07;"I think people move to Switzerland"
01:47:07;01:47:10;"because of the natural beauty,"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"the very high-quality chocolate,"
01:47:12;01:47:15;"the booming pharmaceutical industry,"
01:47:15;01:47:17;"and then the fact that you don't have to pay tax, whatever."
01:47:17;01:47:19;"I'm just saying a lot of international wealth"
01:47:19;01:47:21;"resides in Switzerland."
01:47:21;01:47:22;"There's no income tax there?"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"I don't know if there's no income tax,"
01:47:24;01:47:27;"but there's little to no income tax."
01:47:27;01:47:28;"I wonder why that--"
01:47:28;01:47:29;"If you establish residency,"
01:47:29;01:47:31;"if you're a resident of especially a place"
01:47:31;01:47:33;"with fairly high taxes like the U.K.,"
01:47:33;01:47:35;"if you establish residency in Switzerland,"
01:47:35;01:47:37;"you're absolutely paying less in taxes."
01:47:37;01:47:39;"That's not what this is about."
01:47:39;01:47:42;"My point is that Phil Collins lives in Switzerland"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"in a small town on Lake Geneva,"
01:47:44;01:47:47;"as do Mutt Lang and Shania Twain."
01:47:47;01:47:49;"Does Clooney have a place-- No, he's in Italy."
01:47:49;01:47:51;"He's got the Lake Como crib."
01:47:51;01:47:53;"It was always interesting to me when I realized,"
01:47:53;01:47:54;"""Wow, these people live--"
01:47:54;01:47:55;"I wonder if they ever see each other."""
01:47:55;01:47:59;"They live probably within 20 miles of each other in Switzerland."
01:47:59;01:48:04;"And Shania and Mutt Lang, from what I've read,"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"they split up, but they have children together."
01:48:06;01:48:08;"So they decided, ""You know what?"
01:48:08;01:48:10;"""We're going to make this easy on our kid."
01:48:10;01:48:12;"""We have the money to do it."
01:48:12;01:48:14;"""We're going to create a situation"
01:48:14;01:48:16;"""in which the kid can go back and forth between--"
01:48:16;01:48:18;"""I don't know if it's wings of the house or houses next door."""
01:48:18;01:48:21;"They built something to make life easy on their kid,"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"which seems very reasonable."
01:48:23;01:48:27;"Once I was talking to somebody who was in a band"
01:48:27;01:48:29;"that recorded with Mutt Lang,"
01:48:29;01:48:31;"and I was like, ""Oh, so you record at the Switzerland crib?"""
01:48:31;01:48:33;"And he was like, ""Oh, yeah."""
01:48:33;01:48:34;"I was like, ""You ever see Shania?"""
01:48:34;01:48:35;"He's like, ""No, not once."""
01:48:35;01:48:37;"She's fully in this other--"
01:48:37;01:48:41;"It's kind of like Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera did their thing."
01:48:41;01:48:43;"And I always thought about that,"
01:48:43;01:48:46;"how these international superstars like Phil Collins and Shania"
01:48:46;01:48:50;"posted up in weird, beautiful but weird,"
01:48:50;01:48:53;"kind of like vibeless Switzerland."
01:48:53;01:48:55;"And especially Shania."
01:48:55;01:48:56;"Yeah, it's really weird."
01:48:56;01:48:59;"As far as I understand, she's a full-time resident of Switzerland."
01:48:59;01:49:03;"She also owns a massive sheep ranch in New Zealand."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"But she's a country star. It's so American."
01:49:05;01:49:07;"Well, she's Canadian."
01:49:07;01:49:08;"Oh, wow. Well, you know what I'm saying."
01:49:08;01:49:10;"Right, right. But I also kind of wonder,"
01:49:10;01:49:12;"does she have a home in Canada?"
01:49:12;01:49:14;"I recognize that this is none of my business."
01:49:14;01:49:15;"So obviously, Shania, if you're listening,"
01:49:15;01:49:19;"I'm not pressuring you to divulge info about your residencies."
01:49:19;01:49:20;"It's just interesting to me."
01:49:20;01:49:23;"Just like when you meet somebody from a place"
01:49:23;01:49:26;"that has nothing to do with their life anymore."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"I was picturing this person--"
01:49:28;01:49:31;"from what I understand, she had a real hardscrabble upbringing,"
01:49:31;01:49:35;"really lived country life when she was growing up in Canada."
01:49:35;01:49:39;"And now she just lives in a big-ass house in Switzerland."
01:49:39;01:49:41;"I mean, life's crazy like that, man."
01:49:41;01:49:44;"# Going out tonight, I'm feeling all right"
01:49:44;01:49:48;"# Gonna let it all hang out"
01:49:48;01:49:52;"# Wanna make some noise, really raise my voice"
01:49:52;01:49:56;"# Yeah, I wanna scream and shout"
01:49:56;01:50:03;"# No inhibitions, make no conditions"
01:50:03;01:50:07;"# Get a little out of line"
01:50:07;01:50:11;"# I ain't gonna apolitically correct"
01:50:11;01:50:15;"# I only wanna have a good time"
01:50:15;01:50:19;"# The best thing about being a woman"
01:50:19;01:50:23;"# Is the variety, to have a little fun, yeah"
01:50:23;01:50:27;"# Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy"
01:50:27;01:50:29;"# Forget I'm a lady"
01:50:29;01:50:31;"# Men's shirts, short skirts"
01:50:31;01:50:35;"# Oh, oh, oh, really go wild, yeah"
01:50:35;01:50:37;"# Doin' it in style"
01:50:37;01:50:41;"# Oh, oh, oh, get in the action"
01:50:41;01:50:43;"# Feel the attraction"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"# I'm callin' my head, do what I dare"
01:50:45;01:50:48;"# Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be free, yeah"
01:50:48;01:50:52;"# Feel the way I feel"
01:50:52;01:50:55;"# Man, I feel like a woman"
01:51:02;01:51:05;"# The girls need a break tonight"
01:51:05;01:51:10;"# We're gonna take a chance to get out of town"
01:51:10;01:51:14;"# We don't need romance, we only wanna dance"
01:51:14;01:51:18;"# We're gonna let our hair hang down"
01:51:18;01:51:22;"# The best thing about being a woman"
01:51:22;01:51:26;"# Is the variety, to have a little fun, yeah"
01:51:26;01:51:30;"# Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy"
01:51:30;01:51:32;"# Forget I'm a lady"
01:51:32;01:51:34;"# Men's shirts, short skirts"
01:51:34;01:51:37;"# Oh, oh, oh, really go wild, yeah"
01:51:37;01:51:40;"# Doin' it in style"
01:51:40;01:51:43;"# Oh, oh, oh, get in the action"

01:51:51;01:51:54;"# Feel the way I feel"
01:51:54;01:51:57;"# Man, I feel like a woman"
01:51:57;01:52:01;"# Eat, go down in the DM time crisis"
01:52:01;01:52:05;"# With Ezra Koenig on Beats 1"
01:52:05;01:52:08;"Not to get, like, too dark again,"
01:52:08;01:52:11;"but I've always been interested, when you go on Wikipedia"
01:52:11;01:52:13;"and you're looking at people from the past"
01:52:13;01:52:16;"and see the really gnarly born and die combos."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"Wait, what do you mean?"
01:52:18;01:52:21;"Some of the dramatic is people who lived through some crazy,"
01:52:21;01:52:24;"tumultuous event, and you see all these people who got out."
01:52:24;01:52:27;"For instance, if you look at all the musicians and artists"
01:52:27;01:52:30;"and scientists who, like, fled the Nazi regime."
01:52:30;01:52:33;"So you look at all these people, and you'll be like,"
01:52:33;01:52:36;"""Oh, this dude,"" some, like, whatever scientist guy,"
01:52:36;01:52:39;"it's like, ""Born in, like, Stuttgart, Germany, 1905."
01:52:39;01:52:42;"""Died in La Jolla, California, like, 1965."""
01:52:42;01:52:44;"There's a lot of those combos."
01:52:44;01:52:47;"Like, Stefan Zweig, the famous writer"
01:52:47;01:52:51;"who kind of inspired, like, the Grand Budapest Hotel."
01:52:51;01:52:53;"He was a dude from Vienna."
01:52:53;01:52:56;"He ended up killing himself in, like, deep Brazil."
01:52:56;01:52:58;"Like, that's just, like, where he ended up."
01:52:58;01:53:01;"Yeah. There was a lot of those German avant-garde composers"
01:53:01;01:53:03;"ended up in LA. Yeah, yeah."
01:53:03;01:53:06;"But it's so concise on Wikipedia."
01:53:06;01:53:08;"""Died, 1965, La Jolla."""
01:53:08;01:53:11;"I always think about that a lot, like, where I'll die."
01:53:11;01:53:14;"Like, whenever I'm in a situation where I think I might die..."
01:53:14;01:53:17;"Born, 1984."
01:53:17;01:53:19;"New York, New York."
01:53:21;01:53:23;"I always used to tease my sister"
01:53:23;01:53:26;"because I was born in New York and she was born in New Jersey."
01:53:26;01:53:29;"So even though we both grew up in New Jersey,"
01:53:29;01:53:32;"I would always have that biographical edge."
01:53:32;01:53:34;"So, you know, sometimes, like, when I'm in LA"
01:53:34;01:53:36;"and I think I'm about to die, I'm like..."
01:53:36;01:53:38;"That's not a good one."
01:53:38;01:53:40;"I don't like that. Born, 1984."
01:53:40;01:53:42;"New York, New York."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"Died, Los Angeles, California, 2016."
01:53:44;01:53:46;"Yeah. What would be, like, a cool place?"
01:53:46;01:53:48;"I feel like the born... Like Mars."
01:53:48;01:53:50;"Or, like..."
01:53:50;01:53:52;"Atlantic Ocean, body never found."
01:53:52;01:53:54;"Yeah, that's what I was thinking."
01:53:54;01:53:56;"That's, like, harsh. That's plane crash."
01:53:56;01:53:58;"Oh, I've... God."
01:53:58;01:54:00;"I was thinking, like, boat capsize."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"I was thinking, like, Bermuda Triangle."
01:54:02;01:54:04;"Although I kind of feel like also, like,"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"the New York, New York birth"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"is, like, a strong biographical look."
01:54:08;01:54:10;"Strong start."
01:54:10;01:54:12;"So the strong start is, like, sometimes"
01:54:12;01:54:15;"when I've, like, thought I was gonna die in, like, a small town."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"And I was just kind of like, you know,"
01:54:17;01:54:19;"born New York, New York, 1984."
01:54:19;01:54:21;"Died, 2025, Amarillo, Texas."
01:54:21;01:54:23;"I'm like, that's interesting."
01:54:23;01:54:25;"That's strong."
01:54:25;01:54:27;"That gets the mind working."
01:54:27;01:54:29;"Have you had that happen where you're, like,"
01:54:29;01:54:31;"in a small town, you're like, I might die here."
01:54:31;01:54:33;"Things get hairy on the road, man."
01:54:33;01:54:35;"No, the main times that I've ever, like,"
01:54:35;01:54:37;"like, really thought I was gonna die..."
01:54:37;01:54:39;"Well, you know, your mind can run wild."
01:54:39;01:54:41;"Yeah, sure."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"Sometimes, like, you're by yourself somewhere"
01:54:43;01:54:45;"and there's a person following me."
01:54:45;01:54:47;"Or, like, you're in a place where somebody gets violent."
01:54:47;01:54:49;"Like, you're in a bar. There are, like, some nut walks."
01:54:49;01:54:51;"And, you know, like, these are traumatic times we live in."
01:54:51;01:54:53;"So, like, unfortunately, these things come up a lot."
01:54:53;01:54:55;"The main times when, like, I wonder if I'm gonna die"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"is, like, on a plane. Like, classic."
01:54:57;01:54:59;"Classic."
01:54:59;01:55:01;"Where were you born?"
01:55:01;01:55:03;"Sharon, Connecticut. So that's not a good look."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"My parents were living in upstate New York,"
01:55:05;01:55:07;"but the closest hospital was across state lines."
01:55:07;01:55:09;"Sharon, Connecticut."
01:55:09;01:55:11;"I noticed that on Wikipedia now"
01:55:11;01:55:13;"increasingly will put ""origin."""
01:55:13;01:55:15;"Like, if somebody's born somewhere, but they really, like,"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"came up or identified with another place."
01:55:17;01:55:19;"First of all, I don't have a Wikipedia page."
01:55:19;01:55:21;"Yeah. Oh, really?"
01:55:21;01:55:23;"No, I don't. Oh, we gotta get on that."
01:55:23;01:55:25;"But let's say in the future I have a Wikipedia page."
01:55:25;01:55:27;"Yeah."
01:55:27;01:55:29;"The ""born in this location and died in this location"""
01:55:29;01:55:31;"sort of dichotomy is, like, real low"
01:55:31;01:55:33;"on my priority list."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"So what's more important? What happens in between?"
01:55:35;01:55:37;"I would say so."
01:55:37;01:55:39;"Life's what happens in between"
01:55:39;01:55:41;"where you're born and where you die, man."
01:55:41;01:55:43;"Deep."
01:55:43;01:55:45;"If anybody's listening at home, and you're a fan of"
01:55:45;01:55:47;"""Time Crisis,"" and you're specifically a fan of Jake,"
01:55:47;01:55:49;"make this guy a Wikipedia page."
01:55:49;01:55:51;"I think Jake's accomplished more than enough in his life"
01:55:51;01:55:53;"to have a Wikipedia page."
01:55:53;01:55:55;"That'd be interesting to see, 'cause I'm sure it'd be mostly wrong."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"Well, just go for it."
01:55:57;01:55:59;"Somebody start Jake a Wikipedia--"
01:55:59;01:56:01;"I see some-- sometimes I see"
01:56:01;01:56:03;"the most random Wikipedia pages, man."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"There's, like, a 5% of the audience of this show"
01:56:05;01:56:07;"is a big Jake fan. I've noticed that on Twitter."
01:56:07;01:56:09;"- Oh, about 5%? - People will, like,"
01:56:09;01:56:11;"I'm just making that number up, but people will, like,"
01:56:11;01:56:13;"deep dive and find me."
01:56:13;01:56:15;"Well, that's something. So somebody"
01:56:15;01:56:17;"please start Jake a Wikipedia page."
01:56:17;01:56:19;"Well, we've covered a lot of ground."
01:56:19;01:56:21;"This is, uh, you know,"
01:56:21;01:56:23;"a very dark, weird time"
01:56:23;01:56:25;"for all of us, but, you know,"
01:56:25;01:56:27;"we got to address some serious stuff, some lighter stuff."
01:56:27;01:56:29;"That's what ""Time Crisis"" is all about."
01:56:29;01:56:31;"Thank you so much to Ed Droste"
01:56:31;01:56:33;"for calling in. Excited to hear"
01:56:33;01:56:35;"that grizzly bear that he's working on."
01:56:35;01:56:37;"I wish him the best"
01:56:37;01:56:39;"as we move into"
01:56:39;01:56:41;"a post-primary season."
01:56:41;01:56:43;"Uh, Jake, thanks so much for, uh,"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"your work on the history of the NRA."
01:56:45;01:56:47;"- Yeah, man. - That was educational"
01:56:47;01:56:49;"for everybody, whatever your position"
01:56:49;01:56:51;"on guns might be."
01:56:51;01:56:53;"And thanks to everybody listening."
01:56:53;01:56:55;"Take care of each other. We'll see you in a couple weeks."
01:56:55;01:56:59;"- ""Time Crisis"" with Ezra King."
01:56:59;01:57:01;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
