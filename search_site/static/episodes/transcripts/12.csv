00:11;00:18;"year away from us. Today we'll look back on that year. I'm joined by painter and poet"
00:18;00:23;"Jake Longstreth, the youngest of the Heim girls, Alana ""Baby"" Heim. My sister Emma stops"
00:23;00:38;"by to discuss some family matters, plus my favorite comedian and poet Gerard Carmichael returns to the stage. This is Time Crisis with Andrew K. Nick. B-B-B-B-Beasts
1."
00:38;00:51;"They passed me by, all of those great romances. The war of love, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:51;01:10;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy. And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go. Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:10;01:34;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying. Leave a lonely man, staring at the ceiling. Wishing she was somewhere else instead."
01:34;01:51;"One of us is lonely, one of us is lonely, waiting for a call. Sorry for ourselves, we used to be this small."
01:51;02:10;"Some mother's son lies in the field. Someone has killed some mother's son today. Head burned up by some soldier's gun."
02:10;02:28;"While all the mothers stand and wait. Some mother's son ain't coming home today. Some mother's son ain't got no grave."
02:28;02:46;"Two soldiers fighting in a trench. One soldier glances up to see the sun. And dreams of games he played when he was young."
02:46;03:06;"And then his friend calls out his name. It stops his dreams and as he turns his head. A second later he is dead."
03:06;03:24;"Some mother's son lies in the field. Black hole they put his picture in the frame. But all dead soldiers look the same."
03:24;03:44;"While all the parents stand and wait. To meet their children coming home from school. Some mother's son is lying there."
03:44;04:08;"Somewhere someone is crying. Someone is trying to be so brave. But still the world keeps turning. No more children are going away."
04:08;04:26;"Some mother's son lies in the field. But in his mother's eyes he looks the same. As on the day he went away."
04:26;04:48;"They put his picture on the wall. And when the flowers in the picture frame. Some mother's memory remains."
04:58;05:06;"That was the kinks with some mother's son. A song about the senseless violence of war. Very sad. That song has always moved me a lot."
05:06;05:09;"I think dad played that song for me for the first time when I was a kid."
05:09;05:12;"Oh, I don't think I got to hear it."
05:12;05:19;"I guess that was just a father-son bonding moment. That voice you're hearing is my sister Emma. Welcome to Time Crisis."
05:19;05:20;"Thank you for having me."
05:20;05:23;"As always, we got Jake Longstreth in the building. How are you, Jake?"
05:23;05:32;"Good, man. So did your dad play the full album or was it the specific song? Was he like, Ezra, check out this song. This is about war and death."
05:32;05:38;"Well, okay, I have a few memories about it. I don't know if he played the whole album. But I always had this idea. Maybe one day I'll do a whole episode about it."
05:38;05:42;"Do you remember when mom and dad made the family therapy mixtape?"
05:42;05:43;"No."
05:43;05:49;"Okay, so for context for the listeners, my mom is a family therapist."
05:49;05:57;"And our dad is a set dresser on movies, making sure everything looks right on the films. Also a big music buff."
05:57;06:12;"And so sometime in the 90s, mom had to go to like a family therapy conference. And somehow this idea got cooked up that she should make a mixtape of pop songs about the
family experience."
06:12;06:19;"And dad like helped her with it a lot. It's like a good memory of like mom and dad collaborating on something. You were probably very little."
06:19;06:20;"That sounds awesome."
06:20;06:23;"Nine or 10. So mom and dad made an album or not an album."
06:23;06:25;"But they un-er-cassette."
06:25;06:34;"Yeah, it was like they were like recording off records. And I vividly remember this song, Some Mother's Son, being on it about like the pain of losing a child."
06:34;06:39;"Other songs I remember on it, some of which we played on Time Crisis are D-I-V-O-R-C-E."
06:39;06:40;"Oh, yeah."
06:40;06:43;"The Ramone song, We're a Happy Family. You remember the chorus?"
06:43;06:47;"We're a happy family, we're a happy family, we're a happy family, me, mom and daddy."
06:47;06:54;"Those are the only ones I remember. Next time I'm in New Jersey, I'll look for it. But anyway, that's how I came to know that song."
06:54;07:06;"Do you know that song, Six White Horses? I know the version by Waylon Jennings. Another great like father lamenting his son song. His son goes off to war."
07:06;07:07;"And dies?"
07:07;07:11;"Well, no, he's like, he doesn't know. He's just like, the son's out there at war."
07:11;07:12;"And just waiting to find out?"
07:12;07:16;"And he's just like, this war can go to hell. I want my son back. It's a beautiful song."
07:16;07:18;"Well, let's listen to it. What's it called?"
07:18;07:21;"Six White Horses by Waylon Jennings."
07:21;07:40;"Come here and look through the window, Marie. Open up the shutters and tell me what you see."
07:40;07:57;"Was that his knock that I heard at the door? Or is it six white horses coming down the road?"
07:57;08:09;"Come here and touch me and say that it's all right. You know that to my eyes, the days are as the nights."
08:09;08:23;"Read again the letter that tells me where he's gone. To hell with the fighting, I want my son home."
08:23;08:35;"I taught him to fish and I taught him to be strong. Taught him that killing any man was wrong."
08:35;08:55;"But tomorrow in battle I'd run to where he stood. If the help of a blind man would do any good."
08:55;09:07;"Last night I went to his room for a while. I touched all the things that he used as a child."
09:07;09:22;"I rocked the cradles where he used to lay. I found his ten soldiers and threw them away."
09:22;09:33;"Come here and look through the window, Marie. Open up the shutters and tell me what you see."
09:33;09:53;"Was that his knock that I heard at the door? Or is it six white horses coming up the road?"
09:53;10:03;"That was Waylon Jennings with Six White Horses. That's Jake's pick for depressing songs about war and the loss of children."
10:03;10:11;"Fathers and sons. Oh God, that stuff really gets me. I remember when I was in college, freshman year at Columbia, you got to read the Iliad."
10:11;10:20;"And there's a whole section in it about Achilles. Achilles' mother gets one of the gods to make him a shield."
10:20;10:26;"I remember the professor, who was this really cool old British guy, he was a classicist."
10:26;10:31;"So he studied Greek and stuff. I remember he really got emotional talking about it."
10:31;10:39;"I still don't know if he was so moved by it or if he had some experience with this, having a child who served in the military or something."
10:39;10:44;"But he's just describing the mother giving this special shield to protect her son Achilles."
10:44;10:48;"She couldn't protect him. Well, yeah, because as everybody knows, Achilles died."
10:48;10:52;"Yeah, they got him in the hill. Achilles' last stand. Achilles' last stand, Led Zeppelin."
10:52;10:55;"Wait, so he was emotional in class? Yeah, I remember he started crying."
10:55;11:03;"He was describing, maybe it was like the beauty of Homer's verse. Teaching it for the 80th time, still moved."
11:03;11:09;"That's very impressive. You've got to give it up, because I was a teacher for one year, and I was pretty burned out by the end of that year,"
11:09;11:14;"let alone to be like old British guys teaching the Iliad to the 80th bunch of knuckleheads."
11:14;11:19;"And you can still find something powerful in it. Wow. I want to be like that."
11:19;11:24;"You got to get a PhD in the classics. Step one. Yeah."
11:24;11:30;"No, I mean, good for him. Honestly, because sometimes you're in class and people are teaching you this old garbage,"
11:30;11:33;"and you're like, ""You don't want to teach me this."" Yeah."
11:33;11:37;"You know when you have a teacher who's teaching you Shakespeare, and you can tell they're not even that into it?"
11:37;11:39;"Or they don't even get it. Right, right."
11:39;11:47;"And you're just like in class having these brutal discussions about nobody understands the weird words and the old English,"
11:47;11:50;"and you're just trying to discuss it, and it's so painful."
11:50;11:58;"I remember I had a high school history teacher freshman year named Mr. Elges, and it was his last year teaching."
11:58;12:01;"He was probably in his 60s, and this was world history."
12:01;12:03;"And he was an amazing teacher."
12:03;12:11;"And somehow 40 years in was able to inspire our imaginations with talking about ancient Rome, ancient Egypt."
12:11;12:17;"He had this childlike wonder, just talking about the pyramids,"
12:17;12:20;"and just getting us so pumped up about thinking about people trying to build the pyramids."
12:20;12:23;"I'm like, ""How did they do it?"" Right."
12:23;12:25;"He was amazing. It's rare."
12:25;12:30;"And then my American history teacher was just reading out of the textbook and had no vibe."
12:30;12:33;"Cool story. No, no, no. I mean, it's important."
12:33;12:35;"Are there any songs about teachers?"
12:35;12:38;"There's got to be. Hot Teacher. Hot for Teacher."
12:38;12:40;"Terrible. I don't want to listen to Hot for Teacher."
12:40;12:41;"No, I don't want to either."
12:41;12:44;"Okay, let's listen to ""Teach Me How to Dougie."""
12:44;12:48;"On a serious note, this is going out to all the teachers out there in America."
12:48;12:51;"You're doing God's work, educating the next generation."
12:51;12:55;"Those of you who can find it in your heart to be passionate about the subject matter,"
12:55;12:58;"well, you're very special. So here's ""Teach Me How to Dougie."""
13:07;13:09;"You know why?"
13:09;13:11;"Cuz all the girls love me"

16:21;16:24;"I'm makin' me click, what's up, boy?"
16:24;16:27;"That was Cali Swag District with Teach Me How to Dougie."
16:27;16:29;"That one is going out to all the teachers out there."
16:29;16:32;"And you know what? Let's throw in the students, why not?"
16:32;16:34;"All the teachers and all the students."
16:34;16:38;"So this is the last regular Time Crisis of 2015."
16:38;16:40;"We are gonna do a Christmas special."
16:40;16:42;"Jake, I hope you can come through, do the Christmas special with me."
16:42;16:44;"Tell me about it. What's-- I mean, is there a plan?"
16:44;16:47;"I like the idea, just two bros playing Christmas music,"
16:47;16:49;"making a couple phone calls. That's my concept."
16:49;16:50;"Great."
16:50;16:52;"We'll discuss it more today."
16:52;16:54;"Off mic."
16:54;16:57;"So we got a Christmas special coming up, but this is the last regular show."
16:57;17:00;"So I think it's a good time to look back at 2015."
17:00;17:04;"Emma, I asked you before the show to pick your top three songs of 2015."
17:04;17:07;"You wanna lay 'em on us? What's number one for you?"
17:07;17:10;"I think number one is ""4 or 5 Seconds."""
17:10;17:12;"""4 or 5 Seconds"" by Rihanna."
17:12;17:14;"Rihanna, Kanye, Paul McCartney."
17:14;17:18;"You know who wrote the bridge of ""4 or 5 Seconds""?"
17:18;17:20;"I do. Dave."
17:20;17:22;"That's right, Dave Longstreth, who is the brother of Jake."
17:22;17:23;"Amazing."
17:23;17:26;"Amazing. So this song-- I don't know who else is credited as a songwriter on it,"
17:26;17:30;"but this song is not just a collaboration between Rihanna, Kanye, and Sir Paul,"
17:30;17:32;"but also Dave Longstreth."
17:32;17:34;"So let's-- you know what? Everybody knows this song,"
17:34;17:38;"so let's just skip ahead and listen to the bridge."
17:38;17:42;"This is the bridge of ""4 or 5 Seconds"" going out to my man, Dave."
17:42;17:46;"And I know that I'm through tonight"
17:46;17:51;"Thinking how could I be so selfish"
17:51;17:55;"But you called 'bout a thousand times"
17:55;18:01;"Wondering where I've been"
18:01;18:04;"Now I know that you're home tonight"
18:04;18:10;"Thinking how could I be so reckless"
18:10;18:14;"But I just can't apologize"
18:14;18:20;"I hope you can understand"
18:20;18:22;"Can you hear that Dirty Projectors vibe in it?"
18:22;18:23;"Mm-hmm."
18:23;18:25;"And I-- actually, I don't know if I can do a good impression of Dave."
18:25;18:26;"Yeah."
18:26;18:28;"And I know that you're home tonight"
18:28;18:32;"Thinking how could I be so selfish"
18:32;18:34;"But I just can't apologize"
18:34;18:37;"Wondering where I've been"
18:37;18:38;"Was that good?"
18:38;18:39;"Yeah, that was great."
18:39;18:40;"Oh, thank you."
18:40;18:43;"And also that vocal chord that they hit there is so Projectors."
18:43;18:45;"Yeah, you can picture Dave, Amber."
18:45;18:46;"Yeah."
18:46;18:47;"[laughter]"
18:47;18:49;"Congratulations to Dave."
18:49;18:50;"Yeah, good job, Dave."
18:50;18:52;"For kind of sneaking into Emma's top three."
18:52;18:53;"What else you got?"
18:53;18:57;"Well, number two, probably not the most creative choice,"
18:57;18:59;"but ""Hotline Bling"" by Drake."
18:59;19:00;"Tight."
19:00;19:03;"You used to call me on my cell phone"
19:03;19:04;"That was beautiful."
19:04;19:05;"I don't think we even need to play it."
19:05;19:08;"Late night when you need my love"
19:08;19:10;"[laughter]"
19:10;19:14;"I'll also say for these three songs, I also really like the music videos."
19:14;19:16;"Oh, okay."
19:16;19:17;"It's a total experience."
19:17;19:18;"Okay, I like that."
19:18;19:23;"Yeah, that one has that real kind of minimal James Turrell inspired light vibe."
19:23;19:26;"Some people think that ""Hotline Bling"" is sexist."
19:26;19:28;"I can't really speak to that because I've never heard it."
19:28;19:29;"[laughter]"
19:29;19:30;"Ever?"
19:30;19:32;"How is it? I don't even know what that song's about."
19:32;19:36;"There are some lines where he's maybe a little slut-shaming going on."
19:36;19:40;"The line that I think people have a problem with is he says,"
19:40;19:42;"""You started wearing less and going out more."""
19:42;19:46;"Yeah, that's one that people are upset by."
19:46;19:48;"Getting nasty for someone else."
19:48;19:51;"Because the implication in the song is kind of like there's something wrong with that."
19:51;19:58;"Yeah, he needs to accept that she's seeing other people, she's autonomous now, and he can't."
19:58;20:01;"What, you think all his ex-girlfriends are going to become nuns?"
20:01;20:04;"I think a lot of men don't wish that."
20:04;20:06;"Wait, so they're not even together at this point?"
20:06;20:11;"No, she used to call him on his cell phone past ten."
20:11;20:13;"Oh, yep. Copied that."
20:13;20:14;"Yeah."
20:14;20:16;"All right, well, what's number three?"
20:16;20:19;"Number three is ""Sorry"" by Justin Bieber."
20:19;20:23;"Although, I will say, I just loved Justin Bieber this year."
20:23;20:25;"So it's hard to even--"
20:25;20:26;"A lot of people are saying that."
20:26;20:28;"Yeah. Unexpectedly."
20:28;20:33;"I'm not anti-pop music at all, but I just was very into him this year."
20:33;20:35;"But why didn't you expect that you would like Justin Bieber?"
20:35;20:37;"Why did you have such a negative impression?"
20:37;20:40;"Just because he drunk drove a Lamborghini in Miami?"
20:40;20:41;"Is that why?"
20:41;20:46;"Well, you know, he doesn't have the greatest rep, but did you guys ever watch ""Never Say Never,"" his documentary?"
20:46;20:47;"Yeah, I watched it."
20:47;20:49;"That did make me have a lot of respect for him."
20:49;20:51;"Yeah, because now you know a little bit about where he comes from."
20:51;20:56;"Where he comes from, how hard he works, how multi-talented he is."
20:56;20:58;"You know what I really related to in that video?"
20:58;20:59;"What?"
20:59;21:02;"The anxiety of being a vocalist on the road."
21:02;21:05;"Because he was a really young kid in this."
21:05;21:06;"He just wants to have fun."
21:06;21:10;"He just wants to play Nintendo Wii, Xbox, PS4 with his friends."
21:10;21:15;"And he's constantly worrying about losing his voice."
21:15;21:19;"And he has these vocal coaches being like, ""Justin, you can't say a word today."""
21:19;21:23;"And he's like a little kid basically playing to full arenas."
21:23;21:24;"So that's a rough one."
21:24;21:26;"But here's a little bit of ""Sorry"" by Justin."
21:26;21:29;"[MUSIC - JUSTIN, ""SORRY""]"
23:36;23:39;"[MUSIC - TIME CRISIS]"
23:42;23:44;"That was Justin Bieber with ""Sorry."""
23:44;23:48;"That was Emma's pick for one of the top songs of 2015."
23:48;23:52;"We've just been joined in the studio by Alana ""Baby"" Heim."
23:52;23:53;"What's up?"
23:53;23:55;"I feel like I'm cheating on my own show."
23:55;23:58;"Right, because you have your own show called Heim Time."
23:58;23:59;"Yes."
23:59;24:01;"And that's you and who else?"
24:01;24:04;"Me and these two weirdos that join me every day."
24:04;24:06;"That's really nice of you giving back to the community,"
24:06;24:08;"letting two randos in."
24:08;24:09;"No, it's me and my sisters."
24:09;24:12;"People know who you are, especially people, I think,"
24:12;24:13;"who know who I am know who you are."
24:13;24:15;"So you don't have to get into too much."
24:15;24:21;"One thing I do want to say is I saw Heim play to five people--"
24:21;24:22;"Oh, yeah, you did."
24:22;24:23;"--in New York."
24:23;24:24;"I'm a day one fan, almost."
24:24;24:26;"No, but you saw us play at some weird--"
24:26;24:27;"like, at the Standard."
24:27;24:29;"Remember when you came to-- that was the really first time"
24:29;24:30;"when you saw us at the Standard--"
24:30;24:31;"Oh, yeah, in LA."
24:31;24:32;"--in LA."
24:32;24:33;"Right."
24:33;24:34;"And we were wearing, like--"
24:34;24:37;"it was for some, like, fashion thing."
24:37;24:39;"I don't really remember what it was."
24:39;24:41;"But I remember we were in, like, full face paint."
24:41;24:44;"This was, like, five or six years ago or something."
24:44;24:45;"It was a long-ass time ago."
24:45;24:46;"Right, and I was like--"
24:46;24:47;"And I was like--"
24:47;24:49;"And I told a lot of people, ""These girls can be the next KISS."
24:49;24:50;"They keep rocking that face paint."""
24:50;24:53;"Well, I remember you came-- I forget who you came with,"
24:53;24:54;"but they told us that you were coming,"
24:54;24:56;"and we hadn't really even met yet, so I was like,"
24:56;24:58;"""Oh, my God, Ezra from Vampire Weekend's coming?"""
24:58;25:01;"And then I realized there were, like, five people there,"
25:01;25:03;"and I was like, ""He's going to think we're so lame."""
25:03;25:04;"And I think you definitely did."
25:04;25:07;"You left-- because we were, like, in full face paint,"
25:07;25:09;"wearing, like, these, like, weird designs"
25:09;25:11;"that we got, like, talked into wearing."
25:11;25:14;"It was just, like, not a good time, and I was so embarrassed."
25:14;25:15;"But then we became biffles."
25:15;25:16;"That's right."
25:16;25:17;"At some point."
25:17;25:19;"Actually, I know the point where we became biffles."
25:19;25:20;"Yeah, what was that?"
25:20;25:22;"Rebecca Black."
25:22;25:24;"Oh, when Rebecca Black Friday came out."
25:24;25:25;"Yeah."
25:25;25:27;"We were having dinner, and you were like,"
25:27;25:28;"""I gotta go. I gotta go somewhere."""
25:28;25:32;"And I was like, ""I brought up Rebecca Black for some reason,"
25:32;25:33;"like, Friday?"""
25:33;25:36;"And you were like, ""Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
25:36;25:37;"Hold the phone."""
25:37;25:39;"And then we talked about Rebecca Black for, like--"
25:39;25:42;"We, like, got really deep into Friday,"
25:42;25:45;"like, all the favorite parts that we had of the song."
25:45;25:47;"I mean, I remember when Friday hit."
25:47;25:52;"I mean, you know, that was kind of like when people talk about"
25:52;25:53;"the Beatles on Ed Sullivan."
25:53;25:56;"You know, that's more for, like, our parents' generation,"
25:56;25:58;"the Beatles on Ed Sullivan, or maybe for, like,"
25:58;26:01;"Grandma and Grandpa when jazz first came out."
26:01;26:03;"I think that's kind of for our generation,"
26:03;26:05;"how it felt when Friday, Rebecca--"
26:05;26:06;"I remember there was a buzz in the air."
26:06;26:07;"Yeah."
26:07;26:08;"That was a crazy time."
26:08;26:09;"I think that was also the same--"
26:09;26:11;"that was also around the same time there was that crazy"
26:11;26:12;"hurricane in New York."
26:12;26:13;"It was a weird time."
26:13;26:14;"I'm really glad you reminded me of that."
26:14;26:16;"In fact, I think our listeners would--"
26:16;26:18;"even though we were trying to talk about 2015,"
26:18;26:19;"let's take a trip back a few years--"
26:19;26:20;"Yeah, take a trip back."

28:24;28:27;"one of the most important songs of the Internet era."
28:27;28:30;"And Alana just reminded me that was a song very important"
28:30;28:32;"in the story of how we became Biffles."
28:32;28:34;"I'm not familiar with that term."
28:34;28:36;"A Biffle is a best friend for life."
28:36;28:39;"That's how I know it. Do you know, like, a different--"
28:39;28:42;"I think that's the definition, best friend for life, Biffle."
28:42;28:44;"Very presumptuous. B-F-F-L."
28:44;28:47;"Yeah, Biffle. You're, like, looking at me like I'm spelling something wrong."
28:47;28:49;"Like, I feel like you're trying to--"
28:49;28:51;"That's what I think it is. Yeah, best friend for life."
28:51;28:53;"Why are you throwing me like, ""Suck that""?"
28:53;28:55;"No, no, no, I was just thinking about it."
28:55;28:57;"Don't throw your Biffle under the bus."
28:57;28:59;"Do you have a lot of Biffles? I don't have many Biffles."
28:59;29:03;"I think I can count my Biffles on, like, one-and-a-half hands."
29:03;29:05;"Well, you know what they say."
29:05;29:08;"Count no one a Biffle until you're dead."
29:08;29:12;"Is that-- Is that what they say?"
29:12;29:16;"No, I think the real phrase, which sounds like probably is from the Iliad or something,"
29:16;29:19;"is ""Count no man happy until he's dead."""
29:19;29:22;"'Cause basically, we're just basically saying, ""Oh, you're happy. Oh, see, I'm happy."""
29:22;29:27;"Are you happy? 'Cause you could get real sad for the next 40 years."
29:27;29:31;"I think people are just saying, you know, ""Nothing is for sure until you're dead."""
29:31;29:36;"So if someone's your best friend for life, okay, the only way you conclusively say that they're a Biffle"
29:36;29:39;"is that you're still best friends with them as you die."
29:39;29:42;"So we'll revisit your friendship on your deathbeds."
29:42;29:43;"Yes, next year."
29:43;29:45;"I hope you'll visit me at my deathbed."
29:45;29:46;"Oh, my God, of course."
29:46;29:50;"Next year? Oh, my God, knock on wood."
29:50;29:52;"I still gotta put out album two."
29:52;29:54;"Oh, that's right."
29:54;29:57;"I got three albums in stores now, so, you know, I'm not sweating it too much."
29:57;30:00;"Okay, calm down over there. Calm down."
30:00;30:04;"Alana, when I texted you this morning asking you to come on the show,"
30:04;30:07;"I asked you if you would pick your top three songs of 2015,"
30:07;30:10;"and everybody at home is dying to know."
30:10;30:11;"I mean--"
30:11;30:12;"Your year-end list."
30:12;30:14;"I hate year-end lists."
30:14;30:16;"I tried to make it easy. I just said three songs."
30:16;30:19;"I know, three songs. The thing is, it's like, ""Ugh, I hate that."""
30:19;30:21;"It's like there were so many songs."
30:21;30:26;"Wait, but what do you hate? Just making somebody's day by putting their song on your list?"
30:26;30:33;"No, no. No, I'm all about making people's day and putting songs on Apple Music, Beats 1, what up?"
30:33;30:36;"But it's just so hard to narrow it down to three."
30:36;30:38;"So, like, I kind of-- I think my--"
30:38;30:40;"How many songs came out this year? Twenty?"
30:40;30:45;"Oh, my God. Are you for real? The Fader just put out 107 songs."
30:45;30:46;"But was that all-time or was that this year?"
30:46;30:47;"This year."
30:47;30:49;"Really? That many this year?"
30:49;30:54;"I gasped. Just so you guys know, when I saw it on my Twitter feed, I gasped."
30:54;30:58;"But Fader's trying to put out maybe just 107 songs they listened to this year from all of history?"
30:58;31:03;"The line was ""Top 107 songs of 2015."""
31:03;31:06;"I don't even know that that many songs came out this year."
31:06;31:10;"I mean, I can think of Justin Bieber, sorry, Adele dropped one or two."
31:10;31:11;"Yeah."
31:11;31:13;"After that, I'm drawing a blank."
31:13;31:18;"Wait, are you thinking, like, the top songs, like, the songs that made the most money?"
31:18;31:24;"So, like, when I think of my favorite songs of 2015, I just think of the songs that were on repeat for 2015."
31:24;31:31;"Not like-- Because the thing is, I can go, like, ""Okay, 'Hello,' 'Sorry,' 'Lean On,'"" and those were probably the top songs."
31:31;31:34;"There you have it. Those are Alana's top three songs."
31:34;31:37;"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Even though those are amazing songs. I love all those songs."
31:37;31:40;"No, no, obviously, I want you to choose your top three songs."
31:40;31:47;"That'd be pretty funny if I was like, ""Hey, Alana, can you, like, call your accountant and just come in and tell us the top three moneymakers?"""
31:47;31:49;"I'm just saying that--"
31:49;31:51;"This is Alana Haim with Hip Hop Cash Kings."
31:51;31:57;"Coming in at number one is Drake at $57 million in 2015."
31:57;31:59;"Number two, no stranger to the list, is Jay-Z."
31:59;32:01;"Everybody calm down. Stop yelling at me."
32:01;32:04;"I'm easing into time crisis, okay?"
32:04;32:09;"I'm used to having two sisters, like, back me up on all my endeavors."
32:09;32:12;"Today you got one sister and she's not even your sister."
32:12;32:13;"Hell yeah. Hey, what's up?"
32:13;32:14;"I'm f***ing with it."
32:14;32:15;"Okay, what are your--"
32:15;32:17;"Okay, sorry. Down to brass tacks."
32:17;32:22;"So my first one, this record came out this year, Artangelz Grimes."
32:22;32:25;"Such an awesome record. I'm, like, one of her biggest fans ever."
32:25;32:27;"And what's your favorite song off Artangelz?"
32:27;32:29;"I mean, all of them are amazing."
32:29;32:34;"I've got many, many favorites on this record, but I think Venus Fly is my favorite"
32:34;32:39;"because I hope, like, in the future, if, like, you can walk into a room"
32:39;32:45;"and think of a song and it plays, I hope this song plays every time I walk into a room."
32:45;32:47;"Because it gives me confidence."
32:47;32:49;"Every superhero needs her theme music."
32:49;32:51;"It just bangs so f***ing hard."

32:58;33:16;"[♪♪♪]"
33:17;33:20;"[♪♪♪]"
33:20;33:45;"Grimes, Venus Fly featuring Janelle Monae."
33:45;33:48;"So you pick one Grimes song. What's your next song?"
33:48;33:55;"My next song is Kanye, because obviously Kanye rules my life."
33:55;33:59;"I love Kanye. I've been the biggest Kanye fan since his first record."
33:59;34:02;"I think he-- I always say this. I mean, I think he's, like, the future."
34:02;34:04;"Everything that he puts out is, like, future."
34:04;34:06;"You never know what he's going to put out next,"
34:06;34:08;"and every time it's, like, the biggest surprise."
34:08;34:11;"And ""All Day"" is definitely-- I mean, we put this on--"
34:11;34:15;"when we went on tour this past year, this was, like, our warm-up song to get us pumped up."
34:15;34:17;"- And how long-- - I love this song."
34:17;34:19;"All the lyrics to this song are amazing."
34:19;34:22;"He drops ""The Mall."" I love ""The Mall."""

35:27;35:30;"So it really spoke to my soul, that one."
35:30;35:31;"I might spend all day at the mall,"
35:31;35:33;"maybe on Black Friday or something,"
35:33;35:35;"trying to get stocking stuffers for my loved ones."

35:52;35:54;"I never saw anything get too wild,"
35:54;35:55;"but it was crowded."
35:55;35:57;"Obviously, you've never been to Forever 21"
35:57;35:59;"on Black Friday."
35:59;36:01;"No, that's a ladies' store."
36:01;36:02;"Obviously."
36:02;36:03;"No, there's men's there."
36:03;36:05;"No, like, when I was younger, like, Forever 21."
36:05;36:06;"I'm just kidding."
36:06;36:07;"Of course, I go to Forever 21."

36:10;36:12;"there's no such thing as men's or women's clothes."
36:12;36:13;"Wait, hold on."
36:13;36:14;"Okay, sorry."
36:14;36:17;"I wanted to make--drop some music stuff."
36:17;36:18;"Do you guys know--"
36:18;36:20;"so ""All Day,"" we know, starts with this"
36:20;36:22;"very Kanye-sounding melody."
36:22;36:30;"[imitates Kanye's ""All Day"" melody]"
36:30;36:31;"All day."
36:31;36:33;"And we know that Paul McCartney's featured on the song, right?"
36:33;36:34;"Yeah."
36:34;36:35;"Because he comes in at the end,"
36:35;36:36;"kind of whistling and singing."
36:36;36:39;"But did you know that that melody, in the beginning,"
36:39;36:43;"Paul McCartney wrote it, like, in the '70s or something?"
36:43;36:44;"What?"
36:44;36:46;"So he was on a talk show--I want a playlist--"
36:46;36:48;"he was on a talk show in the U.K. in the '80s,"
36:48;36:50;"and he was talking about how he writes songs."
36:50;36:53;"I noticed you just had two fingers here."
36:53;36:54;"You get that?"
36:54;36:56;"This is him on an '80s talk show."
36:56;36:58;"And so I thought, well, I'll try and see, you know,"
36:58;36:59;"what the chord is."
36:59;37:01;"Kind of explaining his songwriting process."
37:01;37:03;"Ooh, that's nice, you know."
37:03;37:06;"So then I tried to--I used that as the inspiration"
37:06;37:10;"and tried to write a song that only had--used two fingers."
37:10;37:12;"So I'll play you a bit of that."
37:12;37:15;"Note carefully--two fingers all the time."
37:15;37:17;"My hand never leaves my wrist."
37:17;37:19;"[laughter]"
37:19;37:32;"[playing ""Sweet Child O' Mine""]"
37:32;37:34;"What?"
37:34;37:39;"[playing ""Sweet Child O' Mine""]"
37:39;37:41;"That's Paul McCartney's kind of jazzy version."
37:41;37:42;"What?"
37:42;37:44;"I know, so he wrote that, like, 30 years ago,"
37:44;37:46;"and I imagine he walked in the studio, and Kanye was like,"
37:46;37:48;"""You got any leftovers from back in the day?"""
37:48;37:51;"And he's like, ""Well, I wrote this one thing with two fingers,"
37:51;37:52;"and whoo-hoo!"""
37:52;37:54;"And then Kanye's like, ""Oh, that's kind of good."
37:54;37:56;"What if I sang it like this?"""
37:56;38:01;"[playing ""Sweet Child O' Mine""]"
38:01;38:02;"All day."
38:02;38:04;"You can't not say ""all day"" after that."
38:04;38:05;"It's so good."
38:05;38:07;"It's me, Paul."
38:07;38:09;"That wasn't very good."
38:09;38:11;"That's a really awful Beatles impression."
38:11;38:13;"Oh, McCartney."
38:13;38:14;"No, no, no, that was totally--"
38:14;38:17;"No, I don't even get into regional British accents."
38:17;38:19;"What's your final pick for 2015?"
38:19;38:21;"Well, this pick, it was not big,"
38:21;38:23;"and I think it should have been big,"
38:23;38:26;"because I actually got my heart broken in 2015."
38:26;38:28;"It was a very sad heartbreak,"
38:28;38:30;"and one song got me through."
38:30;38:31;"Oh, yeah?"
38:31;38:32;"Yeah, one song got me through."
38:32;38:34;"And I was actually lucky enough to hear this song"
38:34;38:36;"before it came out,"
38:36;38:38;"because our good friend Ariel Reksha"
38:38;38:40;"had produced the record for--"
38:40;38:42;"Oh, what are you talking about, Adele?"
38:42;38:43;"No, not for Adele."
38:43;38:46;"Do you think Adele would let anyone have their song?"
38:46;38:49;"I would be dead if I heard any Adele tracks"
38:49;38:50;"before it came out."
38:50;38:51;"Oh, I'm sorry, when you said heartbreak,"
38:51;38:52;"of course I thought of Adele."
38:52;38:54;"No, of course, I mean, Adele, of course,"
38:54;38:55;"gets you through heartbreak."
38:55;38:57;"What else did Ariel produce this year?"
38:57;38:58;"Brandon Flowers!"
38:58;39:00;"Oh, Brandos."
39:00;39:02;"One of my favorites, Between Me and You."
39:02;39:05;"This song got me through my heartbreak of 2015."
39:05;39:08;"Brandon Flowers, Between Me and You."
39:08;39:12;"Yes, it's on the new record, The Desired Effect."
39:12;39:14;"Produced by our mutual friend, Ariel."
39:14;39:16;"Ariel, disrespect, Shed."
39:16;39:18;"Disrespect, Shed."
39:18;39:19;"Let's check it out."
39:20;39:24;"Between me and you"
39:24;39:28;"I've been thinking about"
39:28;39:31;"The future and"
39:31;39:36;"Between me and you"
39:36;39:40;"I think I'm losing it now"
39:40;39:48;"Between me and you"
39:48;39:51;"I've been worried about"
39:51;39:54;"The future and"
39:54;40:00;"Between me and you"
40:00;40:03;"I think I'm losing it now"
40:03;40:11;"And all my life"
40:11;40:14;"I've been told"
40:14;40:17;"Follow your dreams"
40:17;40:20;"But the trail went cold"
40:20;40:23;"And the heart don't lie"
40:23;40:26;"And that's a good luck charm"
40:26;40:29;"But I'm watching it tear out"
40:29;40:31;"Of my arms"
40:31;40:35;"There's a power in letting go"
40:35;40:36;"Yeah."
40:36;40:41;"I guess I didn't wanna let you know"
40:41;40:43;"That's hot as f---"
40:43;40:44;"Wait, what did you say?"
40:44;40:46;"There's a power in letting go."
40:46;40:47;"Yeah."
40:47;40:48;"I guess I didn't wanna let you know."
40:48;40:49;"Yes."
40:49;40:51;"And then it goes in, I mean, it's more,"
40:51;40:52;"there's a power in letting go."
40:52;40:55;"I thought that that was a very profound lyric for me."
40:55;40:58;"I would probably get that tattooed if I could get tattoos."
40:58;41:01;"It's the opposite of the power of love, Huey Lewis."
41:01;41:02;"Yeah."
41:02;41:03;"The power of letting go."
41:03;41:05;"Well, first of all, I wanna say it's brave to pick"
41:05;41:07;"an emotional song."
41:07;41:08;"Yeah."
41:08;41:10;"Because I think we probably all had this experience,"
41:10;41:12;"you know, we're all sensitive people,"
41:12;41:13;"as Marvin Gaye said,"
41:13;41:17;"and sometimes we'll spend a late night with a quiet record,"
41:17;41:19;"really kind of get into the lyrics,"
41:19;41:21;"really like spend some time with it,"
41:21;41:23;"and then in the cold light of day,"
41:23;41:26;"you're like, wow, I feel so like connected to that"
41:26;41:27;"like beautiful, quiet song,"
41:27;41:29;"that song about heartbreak,"
41:29;41:31;"and then maybe you're talking music with your friends,"
41:31;41:33;"and you're like, hey, you wanna know what's a great song?"
41:33;41:35;"It's this one that I cried to last night,"
41:35;41:37;"and then you play it, and you just like,"
41:37;41:40;"it's horrible watching other people listen to it,"
41:40;41:42;"like everybody's talking, everybody--"
41:42;41:44;"Yes, that's how I just felt."
41:44;41:46;"That's how I just felt."
41:46;41:48;"This song means so much to me."
41:48;41:50;"I know, it's very hard to communicate"
41:50;41:52;"like the really beautiful kind of,"
41:52;41:54;"I guess that's like borderline if you'd call it a ballad,"
41:54;41:55;"but you know what I mean?"
41:55;41:57;"Yeah, like playing these songs that like really moved you"
41:57;41:59;"when you're by yourself, like headphone songs."
41:59;42:02;"I mean, it's definitely a, like I live in LA,"
42:02;42:04;"so it's like a lot of like late night driving."
42:04;42:06;"But by yourself."
42:06;42:09;"Yeah, by myself, like hitting the steering wheel,"
42:09;42:10;"like screaming."
42:10;42:12;"There's a power in letting go."
42:12;42:15;"I know, but like when Taylor Swift hands you the aux cord,"
42:15;42:16;"you're not gonna play that song."
42:16;42:18;"I would play that song for sure."
42:18;42:20;"Maybe it was just the two of you."
42:20;42:22;"No, I think, the thing is, I think it's such a pretty song."
42:22;42:24;"You get to vibes with friends,"
42:24;42:27;"it's not all Venus Fly all the time, believe me."
42:27;42:28;"No, no, I know, I know, but like--"
42:28;42:30;"You could go, like get with your friends and be like,"
42:30;42:32;"let's just vibe out for a second."
42:32;42:33;"There's a power in letting go."
42:34;42:36;"I just feel like in the car, it's so noisy."
42:36;42:38;"Well, it depends, like at what point of your night,"
42:38;42:41;"like I probably wouldn't play this at the beginning of the night."
42:41;42:42;"I wouldn't start off my night with like,"
42:42;42:44;"all right, let's play between me and you."
42:44;42:45;"Like, let's just get into the zone."
42:45;42:47;"I'd probably go with Venus Fly,"
42:47;42:50;"'cause it's like, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow."
42:50;42:51;"And then all day."
42:51;42:53;"And then at the end of the night, when it's like,"
42:53;42:55;"let's calm down for a second."
42:55;42:57;"Let's just remember that we're all friends"
42:57;42:59;"and how lucky we are."
42:59;43:01;"I'll put on Between Me and You."
43:01;43:03;"All right, as long as everybody's ready to listen."
43:03;43:05;"'Cause if people are talking,"
43:05;43:07;"'cause you can talk during the party song,"
43:07;43:08;"and it's okay."
43:08;43:09;"Yes, yeah, of course."
43:09;43:11;"You can't talk during Between Me and You."
43:11;43:13;"No, 'cause it's so beautiful."
43:13;43:14;"Well done, Brandon Flowers,"
43:14;43:16;"and well done, Arielle Disrespectshed."
43:16;43:18;"Shout out, love you guys."
43:18;43:20;"I forgot this album came out in 2015."
43:20;43:21;"I thought it was more like 2014."
43:21;43:23;"No, it was a really good album."
43:23;43:26;"It's one of my faves from 2015."
43:26;43:27;"Yeah, he did a good job."
43:27;43:28;"Yeah."
43:28;43:29;"You know, I didn't really pick"
43:29;43:31;"any of my favorite songs for 2015,"
43:31;43:34;"'cause usually on Time Crisis, I play older music."
43:34;43:36;"I feel your pain."
43:36;43:39;"I can't believe you asked all of us to choose,"
43:39;43:41;"and you didn't even take the time to think about it."
43:41;43:43;"I mean, if I really had to pick my top three,"
43:43;43:44;"I would probably call my account"
43:44;43:46;"and ask which top three made the most money."
43:46;43:48;"Oh, you know what song definitely made a lot of money?"
43:48;43:49;"What?"
43:49;43:50;"Is Major Lazer Lean On."
43:50;43:51;"Oh, yeah."
43:51;43:54;"I think, wasn't that like the most downloaded song of this?"
43:54;43:55;"Maybe not anymore, 'cause of Adele."
43:55;43:57;"It was the most streamed on Spotify."
43:57;43:59;"And it was one of the most successful"
43:59;44:01;"independently released singles of all time."
44:01;44:02;"And here's what I'll say."
44:02;44:04;"You know, a lot of people with a lot of money"
44:04;44:06;"are very bad people."
44:06;44:08;"Having money doesn't make you good."
44:08;44:09;"It often makes you bad."
44:09;44:13;"But in this one instance, I will say that I'm happy"
44:13;44:17;"that an independently released single was very successful."
44:17;44:18;"Hear, hear."
44:18;44:19;"That's something to root for."
44:19;44:20;"It is."
44:20;44:21;"And I like that song."
44:21;44:22;"I'm all about that."
44:22;44:24;"So let's listen to 12 seconds"

49:17;49:18;"Nothing 2D."
49:18;49:21;"His point was a lot of these fitness guys"
49:21;49:24;"are obsessed with the fact that it's not exactly"
49:24;49:27;"from some kind of hippy-dippy moral point of view,"
49:27;49:29;"like, hey, man, live in the moment."
49:29;49:32;"It's more like the blue light emanating from your screen"
49:32;49:35;"is messing with the chemicals in your brain"
49:35;49:37;"and causing you to have higher estrogen than you need"
49:37;49:38;"and blah, blah, blah."
49:38;49:41;"It makes it harder to lose that belly fat."
49:41;49:43;"Put down the phone."
49:43;49:45;"Maybe there is kind of like a--"
49:45;49:47;"Who is your trainer that talks that way?"
49:47;49:49;"Okay, first of all, this is my friend's trainer."
49:49;49:50;"Oh, your friend's trainer, okay."
49:50;49:52;"Is it really your friend's trainer,"
49:52;49:54;"or are you afraid to say it's your trainer?"
49:54;49:56;"No, no, I promise this--"
49:56;49:57;"I don't have, like, an official--"
49:57;49:59;"I used to kind of have a trainer in New York."
49:59;50:00;"This is funny."
50:00;50:04;"The last episode, we talked a lot about men's fitness as well."
50:04;50:07;"I used to, like, sometimes go work out with a dude at my gym,"
50:07;50:08;"but it was pretty casual."
50:08;50:10;"I swear, the guy I'm talking about is not my--"
50:10;50:12;"This guy's, like, this big--"
50:12;50:14;"He's the guy who got Chris Pratt on fat."
50:14;50:17;"This guy's been referenced a few times on your show."
50:17;50:18;"Many times."
50:18;50:20;"You should get some free, like, sessions."
50:20;50:22;"You're getting a lot of publicity."
50:22;50:24;"Well, I haven't said his name yet."
50:24;50:25;"I haven't said his name yet."
50:25;50:27;"Well, we're talking about you."
50:27;50:28;"But you know what?"
50:28;50:30;"I've seen a lot of people say, and I think it's a good thing,"
50:30;50:32;"you know, you got to have the body that you want."
50:32;50:34;"Like, Chris Pratt got jacked, and that's great,"
50:34;50:37;"but that doesn't mean people didn't love him"
50:37;50:39;"and find him attractive and a worthwhile person"
50:39;50:40;"when he was chubbier."
50:40;50:42;"I actually found him more attractive chubbier."
50:42;50:44;"That was my vibe."
50:44;50:45;"So, you know, there you go."
50:45;50:46;"He's more cuddly."
50:46;50:50;"That said, if he's happier having, like, a kind of, like, 12-pack or whatever,"
50:50;50:52;"then that's all that matters is that he's happier with it."
50:52;50:53;"But me, I don't know."
50:53;50:54;"I like him both ways."
50:54;50:55;"Yeah."
50:55;50:57;"So, back to the L.A. music."
50:57;51:01;"Okay, let's do another song by a band that's been around"
51:01;51:03;"for a really long time called Little Wings."
51:03;51:06;"Oh, yes, my buddy Kyle Field, an incredible songwriter."
51:06;51:11;"He released an album this year on Woodzist called ""Explains."""
51:11;51:14;"And let's listen to the song called ""Light Brang."""
51:24;51:28;"Looking at that light, brang, world title and light"
51:28;51:33;"Breathless, fast, thunderclap, I know it's kind of frightening"
51:33;51:37;"Looking at that light, brang, run with it like a marathon"
51:37;51:41;"Sleepy, hollow, headless, and our neighbor calls me Ichabod"
51:41;51:46;"Show up on the roof at night, slide right down the chimney"
51:46;51:50;"Stuff the stockings, eat the cookies, know I'm never stingy"
51:50;51:55;"Awareness that is heightened, muscles that are tight"
51:55;51:59;"Crimson Jersey bear, Brian, now the corner's crying"
52:14;52:17;"Free stride, she wants my free stride"
52:17;52:19;"Brian's a right day bike"
52:19;52:21;"I like it. This is kind of a rap song, huh?"
52:21;52:26;"Sounds like butter. Like, it's like buttery. It's like feeling good."
52:26;52:28;"His songs have gotten super dense."
52:28;52:31;"There was an Ichabod Crane reference in there. I appreciated it."
52:31;52:33;"There's a lot of, I mean, if you get deep on Kyle's lyrics,"
52:33;52:37;"he has a way of really combining some amazing imagery."
52:37;52:41;"There's a lyric in the song that's ""De Chanel up in that pantine,"
52:41;52:43;"water inside that canteen."""
52:43;52:44;"[laughter]"
52:44;52:47;"Because Zooey De Chanel did like a pantine out or something?"
52:47;52:50;"Yeah, it's hilarious, but like, putting that in a song, it's like what?"
52:50;52:51;"""In that pantine."""
52:51;52:53;"And so he lives out in Malibu?"
52:53;52:54;"Yeah."
52:54;52:57;"Yeah, I've only met him briefly, but I've always heard a lot about him from you."
52:57;53:02;"He surfs a lot, very prolific songwriter."
53:02;53:03;"Yeah, he's released a ton of albums."
53:03;53:04;"And you've played guitar with him, right?"
53:04;53:09;"Yeah, I have. I've played in his live band a few times."
53:09;53:12;"But I mean, yeah, this is his, you know, it's fun to, he has like,"
53:12;53:14;"he'll put together like pickup bands."
53:14;53:18;"Right. He sounds like a pretty mellow guy."
53:18;53:22;"Yeah. Mellow can be boring though. It's not."
53:22;53:26;"Oh, right. No, no. I meant like, I'm picturing this guy living in Malibu,"
53:26;53:30;"like writing songs, surfing. Yeah, I don't mean boring at all."
53:30;53:31;"I mean like, uh."
53:31;53:33;"Jimmy Buffett."
53:33;53:34;"Not Buffett."
53:35;53:37;"Just chill on the beach."
53:37;53:39;"The deep dude. Deep dude."
53:39;53:42;"That was Little Wings with Light Brain. What else you got?"
53:42;53:49;"LA Takedown released a new record a few weeks ago on Ribbon Music."
53:49;53:51;"And it's a 40 minute track."
53:51;53:52;"Okay."
53:52;53:53;"And I sent you."
53:53;53:54;"Oh yeah, I heard about this."
53:54;53:57;"Yeah, it's the concept of the band for this record is sort of like"
53:57;54:00;"a Michael Mann soundtrack from 1982."
54:00;54:03;"So it's a lot of, but the band is amazing live."
54:03;54:04;"It's like a seven piece."
54:04;54:08;"And they, they bring it. It's really good live."
54:08;54:09;"Instrumental rock."
54:09;54:10;"Okay."
54:10;54:12;"It's a 40 minute song, but we'll play a couple minutes of it."
54:12;54:13;"Let's just get a taste of it."
54:13;54:14;"Yeah."
54:14;54:15;"So you want to play a little bit of part three?"
54:15;54:16;"Yeah."
54:16;54:18;"All right. Here's LA Takedown with part three of what's,"
54:18;54:20;"and the whole song is called LA Takedown?"
54:20;54:22;"I believe the record's called LA Takedown."
54:22;54:24;"I love when bands have a song."
54:24;54:25;"This is our first record."
54:25;54:26;"With the name of the band."
54:26;54:27;"And it's one song."
54:27;54:28;"Yeah. And it's one song."
54:28;54:31;"We got to make a Vampire Weekend song."
54:31;54:38;"This one starts off kind of chill and then the guitars drop in like a minute in."
54:38;54:44;"And so the whole, the whole piece kind of swells, you know, kind of ebbs and flows."
54:44;54:47;"So we're kind of catching like a chill part here."
54:47;54:52;"What kind of images do you see in your mind's eye when we play this?"
54:52;54:54;"Like a smoggy sunset. I mean, they really."
54:54;54:59;"You see like downtown LA, like a shiny office building?"
54:59;55:07;"Maybe. I'm thinking more of like just bumper to bumper traffic at dusk."
55:07;55:14;"That's cool."
55:14;55:18;"This guy Aaron Olson, this is his kind of project."
55:18;55:23;"And he was telling me that like that concept of a 1982 Michael Mann soundtrack,"
55:23;55:26;"like when he said that, I was like, oh, that's so specific."
55:26;55:32;"So when I think of Michael Mann, I think of his more, I think of like heat in the 90s,"
55:32;55:34;"in the 2000s collateral."
55:34;55:35;"Right."
55:35;55:37;"One of my favorite TC films, that's Tom Cruise."
55:37;55:39;"And great LA movies."
55:39;55:41;"Miami Vice."
55:41;55:43;"What are his 80s movies?"
55:43;55:45;"Thief."
55:45;55:52;"There's a film called Thief with James Caan from '82, '83,"
55:52;55:54;"which I think was a big inspiration for this record."
55:54;55:58;"Although I'm sort of extending my knowledge a little bit."
55:58;56:23;"I'm sort of writing the caps there a little bit."
56:23;56:26;"How would you describe this guitar tone?"
56:26;56:31;"Fuzz."
56:31;56:35;"Is it like digital fuzz?"
56:35;56:37;"I would just take it for what it is."
56:37;56:39;"I think that was a really good -- that's fuzz."
56:39;56:42;"I feel that."
56:42;56:45;"Probably a classic fuzz pedal, but yeah, they're recording on Pro Tools."
56:45;56:46;"There's different kinds of fuzz."
56:46;56:49;"Don't fuzz shame me, Alana."
56:49;56:52;"There's like 60s dirty, like --"
56:52;56:55;"No, this isn't like -- yeah, this isn't like garage rock fuzz."
56:55;57:00;"This is -- I mean, this is like a fuzz pedal from the '80s."
57:00;57:01;"I don't know."
57:01;57:02;"I have no idea, dude."
57:02;57:05;"I think we should do future episodes where we just like --"
57:05;57:06;"Speculate on the pedals?"
57:06;57:10;"Just live narrate very long instrumental music."
57:10;57:13;"Some ELO instrumentals."
57:13;57:15;"Let me text Aaron and ask about the pedal rig."
57:15;57:16;"Yeah, you should."
57:16;57:17;"Great radio."
57:17;57:18;"Can we get Aaron on the phone?"
57:18;57:19;"Probably."
57:19;57:22;"Hey, man, what you working with?"
57:22;57:23;"You know what's cool about this?"
57:23;57:28;"It's like Tame Impala, but for like -- with '80s -- it's like an L.A. Tame Impala."
57:28;57:29;"I could see that."
57:29;57:30;"That's a good record."
57:30;57:32;"That was a really good 2015 record."
57:32;57:34;"Remember we saw them live together?"
57:34;57:35;"We did."
57:35;57:37;"At Terminal 5 in New York."
57:37;57:38;"Yes."
57:38;57:39;"Oh, yeah, we did."
57:39;57:40;"I forgot about that."
57:40;57:41;"Yeah, we did."
57:41;57:43;"There was an epic journey to that concert."
57:43;57:44;"We got a lot of steps in that day."
57:44;57:45;"Oh, right, right."
57:45;57:46;"Yeah, I remember that."
57:46;57:48;"That was definitely one of my top shows of 2015."
57:48;57:49;"Yeah."
57:49;57:51;"I haven't seen very many shows in 2015, though."
57:51;57:52;"You know what, Jake?"
57:52;57:57;"I got to say, you put together a killer set of L.A. music."
57:57;58:00;"I literally liked every song you played, and that's why --"
58:00;58:01;"That's a rarity."
58:01;58:06;"-- I will definitely not let you play -- no, okay."
58:06;58:09;"Nicholas Krugovich, one more L.A. song."
58:09;58:12;"Yeah, well, it's called ""PCH on Oscar Night."""
58:12;58:14;"""Driving on PCH on Oscar Night."""
58:14;58:15;"Whoa, very L.A."
58:15;58:16;"Okay."
58:16;58:17;"It's a good one."
58:17;58:19;"""Driving on PCH on Oscar Night."""
58:19;58:20;"It's a good one."
58:20;58:21;"All right, let's check it out."
59:57;01:00:03;"I like it."
01:00:03;01:00:05;"Nicholas Krugovich."
01:00:05;01:00:09;"That is K-R-G-O-V-I-C-H, Nicholas Krugovich."
01:00:09;01:00:13;"Part-time L.A. guy, part-time Vancouver, Canada."
01:00:13;01:00:15;"Oh, that's Vancouver, I see."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"A big ""Time Crisis"" fan."
01:00:17;01:00:18;"Krugovich?"
01:00:18;01:00:19;"Oh, yeah."
01:00:19;01:00:20;"Oh, amazing."
01:00:20;01:00:22;"Well, he's got a lot of fans in this room after --"
01:00:22;01:00:24;"I think most of us are hearing that for the first time."
01:00:24;01:00:25;"You should put together --"
01:00:25;01:00:29;"I want to see, like, a Nuggets-type compilation put together by Jake."
01:00:29;01:00:30;"I'd love to."
01:00:30;01:00:31;"For L.A. 2015 music."
01:00:31;01:00:32;"Love to."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"At the very least, a playlist."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"I think this is a good start here."
01:00:36;01:00:37;"Very vibey."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"""Along the PCH on Oscar Night."""
01:00:39;01:00:45;"Out here in Los Angeles, the mood really shifts during awards season."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"Truth."
01:00:46;01:00:49;"You really can't escape that energy in the air."
01:00:49;01:00:57;"You know, one funny thing, I won't say who, but a friend who moved here from New York,"
01:00:57;01:01:00;"who is a very big L.A. proponent, once said --"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"and he's always kind of saying how L.A. --"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"he's so glad he moved out of New York, he loves L.A."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"And he's always super positive, and one time he was like,"

01:01:15;01:01:19;"And he was like, ""You know, man, I love L.A., but the one time I've had Buyers Remorse --"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"awards season."""
01:01:21;01:01:24;"And I was like, ""What are you talking about?"""
01:01:24;01:01:28;"This person, he bought a house or whatever, I think he kind of felt like,"
01:01:28;01:01:37;"""Look, when you're out in New York, Boston, Chicago, Asheville, North Carolina, wherever."""
01:01:37;01:01:39;"All the big places."
01:01:39;01:01:40;"All the big places."
01:01:40;01:01:41;"I love Asheville."
01:01:41;01:01:45;"When you watch the Oscars, it's like this goofy, distant dream world."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"Okay."
01:01:46;01:01:48;"Or especially the Golden Globes."
01:01:48;01:01:55;"But if you're in L.A. and you're showbiz or showbiz adjacent, as all of us are,"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"and somebody invites you over to watch the Golden Globes,"
01:01:57;01:02:04;"it's not like throw popcorn at the screen with your kooky aunt."
01:02:04;01:02:09;"People might be like, ""Hey, don't make fun of Big Bang Theory"

01:02:17;01:02:21;"Mine are just filled with Chinese food and loving times."
01:02:21;01:02:24;"Exclusively relatives of Big Bang Theory employees."
01:02:24;01:02:31;"Okay, full disclosure, the last Golden Globes party I went to was Johnny Galecki's nephew."
01:02:31;01:02:35;"And I tried to poke a little bit of fun at Big Bang Theory."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"I thought it's the biggest show on TV."
01:02:37;01:02:40;"I should be able to say a little something goofy, and he said,"

01:02:54;01:02:56;"If we haven't, then I really want to play there."
01:02:56;01:02:59;"It's a very cool town. It's one of my top towns of 2015."

01:03:00;01:03:01;"With Dirty Projectors?"
01:03:01;01:03:02;"Yeah, 2005."
01:03:02;01:03:03;"We played a house."
01:03:03;01:03:04;"We played a house show."
01:03:04;01:03:05;"Oh, yeah."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"I've been there with Dirty Projectors and Vampire Weekend."
01:03:07;01:03:08;"That's tight."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"That's a great town. It's a college town."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"Yeah."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"It's a very hippie-ish town."
01:03:13;01:03:14;"A lot of New Age."
01:03:14;01:03:18;"Definitely, there's a radical bookstore in town."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"A lot of Thai food."

01:03:21;01:03:23;"A lot of student Thai food."
01:03:23;01:03:24;"Yeah."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"What does that mean?"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"I think it means the type of Thai restaurant where you go,"
01:03:27;01:03:32;"and your waiter is a 6'2"", 220 white dude with a headband."
01:03:32;01:03:33;"Sure, sure."
01:03:33;01:03:37;"That's what I'm picturing, when I picture an Asheville Thai restaurant."
01:03:37;01:03:40;"So vivid. Such a vivid picture."
01:03:40;01:03:42;"Second-string quarterback."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"Also working at the Thai restaurant."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"Excuse me, sir."

01:03:49;01:03:53;"Uh, you know, man, honestly, I'm not sure."

01:03:54;01:03:56;"[laughter]"
01:03:56;01:04:01;"You know, I'll go ask in the kitchen, man, but if you're really allergic,"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"I wouldn't hit it."
01:04:03;01:04:06;"[laughter]"
01:04:06;01:04:09;"Uh, I love--dora memories."
01:05:21;01:05:35;"Back to awards. Let's talk about what really matters."
01:05:35;01:05:36;"Awards."
01:05:36;01:05:38;"You got an award."
01:05:38;01:05:40;"I'm a professional musician, yes."
01:05:40;01:05:42;"And, uh, yeah."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"Me and those guys won a Grammy last year, so I'm--"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"Well-deserved. A well-deserved Grammy."
01:05:46;01:05:48;"Wait, who--sorry, what did you win a Grammy for?"
01:05:48;01:05:53;"Vampire Weekend won Best Alternative Album at the 2014 Grammys."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"And it was very well-deserved."
01:05:55;01:05:57;"Very cool, man."
01:05:57;01:05:59;"[laughter]"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"Not everybody understands. This is like--"
01:06:01;01:06:07;"The Grammys have so many categories that the vast majority are not televised."
01:06:07;01:06:11;"So before the televised Grammys, you kind of go sit in this--"
01:06:11;01:06:15;"in kind of like what feels a little bit like the JV room."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"Oh, no."
01:06:16;01:06:19;"I'm not dissing it. I mean, like, look, whatever."
01:06:19;01:06:23;"But it's basically like--you know, at the Grammys, it's like you're in the Staples Center."
01:06:23;01:06:26;"You know? And it's like this big production."
01:06:26;01:06:29;"But before that, during the day, there's a smaller auditorium."
01:06:29;01:06:31;"People kind of are walking in and out."
01:06:31;01:06:33;"People are, like, talking a little bit."
01:06:33;01:06:37;"So I kind of remember--this is my vivid Grammy memory--"
01:06:37;01:06:41;"is that I'm there with Rostam, Chris and Chris, Ariel,"
01:06:41;01:06:44;"who co-produced the album with Rostam, and we're all hanging out"
01:06:44;01:06:48;"and kind of just waiting for our category, which was literally the last category."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"It was. I watched the whole thing."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"Of the pre-televised thing."
01:06:51;01:06:56;"And so I remember you're kind of nervous and kind of also like, you know, what's going on?"
01:06:56;01:07:02;"And right before Best Alternative Album was all the Rap Awards."
01:07:02;01:07:03;"Yeah."
01:07:03;01:07:07;"So I'm sitting in the crowd kind of feeling nervous."
01:07:07;01:07:10;"Like, there's also this weird energy because people are walking in and out of the auditorium."
01:07:10;01:07:15;"You know, it feels a little bit like you're at some, like, auction or something."
01:07:15;01:07:20;"And I believe it was Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jim."
01:07:20;01:07:21;"I can't remember."
01:07:21;01:07:22;"I remember Cindy Lauper was the host."
01:07:22;01:07:23;"Oh, Cindy Lauper was the host."
01:07:23;01:07:25;"But anyway, they're presenting all the Rap Awards,"
01:07:25;01:07:29;"and Macklemore and Ryan Lewis had a clean sweep that year,"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"but they weren't even in the room."
01:07:31;01:07:36;"So basically, every time they gave a Rap Award, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis won,"
01:07:36;01:07:40;"and then they'd say, ""All right, well, you know, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis can't be here right now"
01:07:40;01:07:44;"because, you know, they're next door at the big show getting ready."""
01:07:44;01:07:47;"So basically, it's like all these awards go to Macklemore,"
01:07:47;01:07:51;"and he's not even there to accept them because he's at the big show getting ready."
01:07:51;01:07:55;"And then they're like, ""Okay, now""--so like literally three or four in a row,"
01:07:55;01:07:58;"they're too busy to even come to this part of the Grammys, and like,"
01:07:58;01:08:00;"""And now Best Alternative Album, Vampire Weekend."""
01:08:00;01:08:03;"It's kind of like, ""I'm really going to get up there and give, like, a speech."""
01:08:03;01:08:05;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:08:05;01:08:08;"I think--yeah, I think you handled it amazingly."
01:08:08;01:08:15;"No, I mean, we all walked up, and they handed it to me, and I said, ""Thank you."""
01:08:15;01:08:16;"Yeah."
01:08:16;01:08:17;"I'm just saying, like--"
01:08:17;01:08:18;"I think that was the best way to do it."
01:08:18;01:08:20;"You guys looked so rad up there."
01:08:20;01:08:21;"Yeah, there's some good pictures."
01:08:21;01:08:25;"I always send Ariel this picture of me, like, hoisting the Grammy in front of his face."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"I've seen it. I've seen it."
01:08:27;01:08:28;"But you know what I mean?"
01:08:28;01:08:33;"Like, if after--Macklemore's a no-show for three Rap Awards in a row."
01:08:33;01:08:34;"Imagine if I got up there--"
01:08:34;01:08:35;"Giving him passion."
01:08:35;01:08:38;"And I was just like, ""Wow."""
01:08:38;01:08:40;"[laughter]"
01:08:40;01:08:41;"Taking the thin."
01:08:41;01:08:43;"""What can I say?"""
01:08:43;01:08:49;"No, whatever. It was exciting, and it was really--it's nice that whoever voted for that category voted for us."
01:08:49;01:08:50;"It was very well-deserved."
01:08:50;01:08:53;"And of course, yeah, we were proud of the work."
01:08:53;01:08:56;"But anyway, that's my Grammy story."
01:11:58;01:12:02;"Love. I don't get enough of it."
01:12:02;01:12:07;"This week, in lieu of doing the normal iTunes Top 5, we're going to do a special Grammy edition."
01:12:07;01:12:12;"Because this is the beginning of awards season, which is a very sacred time here in LA."
01:12:12;01:12:17;"Basically, awards season starts when the Grammy nominations come out, and then you have the Oscar nominations."
01:12:17;01:12:20;"And then you have Christmas, which is part of awards season."
01:12:20;01:12:21;"It really is."
01:12:21;01:12:24;"And then you have New Years, and then you actually have the awards shows."
01:12:24;01:12:25;"Wow."
01:12:25;01:12:28;"So basically, all in all, the whole thing takes 11 months."
01:12:28;01:12:30;"Well, the Golden Globes are somewhere in there."
01:12:30;01:12:31;"Oh yeah, then you have the GGs."
01:12:31;01:12:32;"The GGs."
01:12:32;01:12:33;"January, right?"
01:12:33;01:12:34;"Yeah."
01:12:34;01:12:36;"Real war's head over here."
01:12:36;01:12:37;"Weighing in."
01:12:37;01:12:38;"[laughter]"
01:12:38;01:12:44;"So anyway, because this is a music show, we're not going to concern ourselves with the Golden Globes, or the Emmys, or the Oscars."
01:12:44;01:12:45;"We're going to talk about the Grammys."
01:12:45;01:12:54;"So rather than do our normal Top 5, we're going to do the Top 5 songs of the year, as nominated by the Grammys."
01:13:00;01:13:04;"Are you guys ready for the Top 5 songs of the year?"
01:13:04;01:13:05;"Yes."
01:13:06;01:13:07;"From the Grammys."
01:13:07;01:13:08;"Yes."
01:13:09;01:13:10;"Okay."
01:13:10;01:13:11;"Well, first of all, we've got to clarify something."
01:13:11;01:13:16;"We're choosing to go through the Top 5 songs of the year, the nominees for that category in the Grammys."
01:13:16;01:13:20;"There's also a category called Record of the Year, which is very confusing."
01:13:20;01:13:22;"Yeah, I've never known the difference."
01:13:22;01:13:23;"What is the difference?"
01:13:23;01:13:25;"All right, I'm about to break it down for you guys."
01:13:25;01:13:26;"All right."
01:13:26;01:13:30;"I'm a music industry professional, and I looked it up last night when I was talking about this with somebody."
01:13:30;01:13:33;"Song of the Year goes to the songwriters."
01:13:33;01:13:36;"Oh!"
01:13:36;01:13:43;"Because Song of the Year is like the people who wrote the notes, wrote the words, wrote the melodies."
01:13:43;01:13:46;"So Song of the Year literally means like the song itself."
01:13:46;01:13:51;"Because imagine back in the day--I mean, even today, you could be a great singer, but maybe you didn't write the song."
01:13:51;01:13:55;"So Song of the Year, I guess it goes to the artists too, but it's about the songwriters."
01:13:55;01:13:59;"And Record of the Year is about the record, the recording."
01:13:59;01:14:00;"Like the single."
01:14:01;01:14:05;"But we're doing Song of the Year out of respect to the craft of songwriting."
01:14:05;01:14:06;"That's tight."
01:14:06;01:14:16;"So the first nominee for Grammys 2014 Song of the Year is by a rapper called Kendrick Lamar, and the song is ""All Right."""
01:14:34;01:14:50;"[rapping]"
01:14:50;01:15:16;"[rapping]"
01:15:16;01:15:45;"[rapping]"
01:15:45;01:16:00;"[rapping]"
01:16:00;01:16:20;"[rapping]"
01:17:00;01:17:27;"[rapping]"
01:17:27;01:17:29;"That's Kendrick Lamar with ""All Right."""
01:17:29;01:17:30;"What else do I want to point out?"
01:17:30;01:17:31;"That's one of the videos of the year."
01:17:31;01:17:32;"Love that video."
01:17:32;01:17:34;"That might be my favorite video of the year."
01:17:34;01:17:36;"It's beautiful, black and white."
01:17:36;01:17:39;"So because we're doing Song of the Year, we're talking about the songwriters."
01:17:39;01:17:44;"Let's actually look on the internet who are credited as songwriters on ""All Right."""
01:17:44;01:17:45;"Kendrick Duckworth."
01:17:45;01:17:46;"Is that Kendrick's real name?"
01:17:46;01:17:47;"Is that--really?"
01:17:47;01:17:48;"Kendrick Duckworth."
01:17:48;01:17:50;"That's such an amazing last name."
01:17:50;01:17:53;"So Kendrick Duckworth, a.k.a. Kendrick Lamar."
01:17:53;01:17:55;"Mark Anthony Spears."
01:17:55;01:17:56;"Does that name ring a bell?"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"Not to me, but maybe."
01:17:58;01:17:59;"I'm listening to Mark Anthony."
01:17:59;01:18:02;"It's like Mark Anthony and Britney Spears had a baby."
01:18:02;01:18:03;"Yeah."
01:18:03;01:18:05;"Britney Spears' cousin."
01:18:05;01:18:07;"Whoever he is, he's contributed to an amazing song."
01:18:07;01:18:08;"And Pharrell Williams."
01:18:08;01:18:11;"Not everybody--like, Alana, you were just pointing out that Pharrell is on this song."
01:18:11;01:18:13;"Yes."
01:18:13;01:18:15;"This song is so hot."
01:18:15;01:18:18;"Yeah, so Obama's Song of the Year was not ""All Right,"""
01:18:18;01:18:21;"but Kendrick's song ""How Much a Dollar Costs"" from the same album."
01:18:21;01:18:23;"So we can presume he probably likes ""All Right"" too."
01:18:23;01:18:25;"I'm going to miss Obama."
01:18:25;01:18:26;"I know."
01:18:26;01:18:27;"Wow, where's he going?"
01:18:27;01:18:29;"A year from now."
01:18:29;01:18:30;"He can't run again?"
01:18:30;01:18:33;"Yeah, why did you take such a long pause?"
01:18:33;01:18:35;"Did you not know that he can't run again?"
01:18:35;01:18:40;"Look, last time I was in social studies was about 25 years ago, Alana."
01:18:40;01:18:45;"Yeah, Mike Bloomberg was going to New York for like 20 years."
01:18:45;01:18:47;"Presidential terms."
01:18:47;01:18:51;"Yeah, that's going to be an exciting race, I hope."
01:18:51;01:18:53;"We'll never have a president again that likes rap."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"Oh."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"I don't know about that."
01:18:55;01:18:57;"Give it another 20 years, 30 years."
01:18:57;01:19:01;"I guess that's a good point because of the frontrunners,"
01:19:01;01:19:06;"we have a very bad man, Donald Trump, not a rap fan."
01:19:06;01:19:08;"He probably likes some rap songs."
01:19:08;01:19:09;"No."
01:19:09;01:19:11;"Don't say anything good about him."
01:19:11;01:19:12;"Okay, it's true."
01:19:12;01:19:15;"Ted Cruz, definitely not a rap fan."
01:19:15;01:19:16;"No."
01:19:16;01:19:18;"Rubio might."
01:19:18;01:19:21;"Marco's pretty cool."
01:19:21;01:19:23;"He can get down."
01:19:23;01:19:26;"Rubio might be -- just because he's like a younger dude,"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"I bet if you were like, ""What's your favorite rap song?"""
01:19:28;01:19:32;"He'd probably be like, ""Will Smith, Miami."""
01:19:32;01:19:34;"He's not going to drop Kendrick."
01:19:34;01:19:35;"No, no, of course not."
01:19:35;01:19:36;"That's awesome."
01:19:36;01:19:37;"No, none of the Republicans would."
01:19:37;01:19:40;"But as far as the Democrats go, Hillary,"
01:19:40;01:19:43;"if they asked what your favorite rap song is,"
01:19:43;01:19:45;"she would definitely ask one of the interns."
01:19:45;01:19:48;"I think she would say Kendrick for sure."
01:19:48;01:19:51;"Well, actually, there's a young man out of Compton named Kendrick Lamar,"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"and he's speaking truth to power."
01:19:53;01:19:57;"And, frankly, I don't agree with everything that he says,"
01:19:57;01:20:00;"but I have it on my playlist."
01:20:00;01:20:04;"I'm picturing Hillary on a campaign stop in Compton"
01:20:04;01:20:09;"with like a brand-new ball cap, flat brim, NWA."
01:20:09;01:20:11;"We've got to wrap up with Bernie."
01:20:11;01:20:15;"That's what's cool about Bernie is that he probably doesn't know any music."
01:20:15;01:20:17;"Oh, okay, all right, yeah."
01:20:17;01:20:22;"Our producer Colin just pointed out that Bernie did an interview with Killer Mike"
01:20:22;01:20:23;"from Run the Jewels."
01:20:23;01:20:25;"Did Bernie know Killer Mike's music?"
01:20:25;01:20:26;"Who knows?"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"But whatever, he sat down with him."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"Killer Mike's a very smart political guy, so whatever."
01:20:30;01:20:31;"That's cool."
01:20:31;01:20:33;"And Bernie wouldn't feign that he knew."
01:20:33;01:20:34;"Right."
01:20:34;01:20:35;"That's the thing about Bernie."
01:20:35;01:20:37;"He's like, ""You're a respected musician in your field."
01:20:37;01:20:40;"I don't know your music,"" but it wouldn't matter."
01:20:40;01:20:41;"Yeah, yeah."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"They tell me that you are--"
01:20:43;01:20:44;"[laughter]"
01:20:44;01:20:48;"They tell me that you're a respected musician."
01:20:48;01:20:51;"Let's talk about what really matters."
01:20:51;01:20:54;"The working people in this country."
01:20:54;01:20:58;"And yeah, he definitely wouldn't be hitting the nae nae."
01:20:58;01:21:01;"Have you heard the Bernie Sanders record?"
01:21:01;01:21:02;"No, what's that?"
01:21:02;01:21:03;"What?"
01:21:03;01:21:04;"Yeah, he made a record in the '80s."
01:21:04;01:21:05;"No, he didn't."
01:21:05;01:21:06;"Time out."
01:21:06;01:21:08;"We're going to take a quick time out from Grammy Song of the Year."
01:21:08;01:21:10;"Bernie Sanders made a record in the '80s?"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"That's speaking or music?"
01:21:12;01:21:13;"Yes."
01:21:13;01:21:14;"On Apple Music?"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"He does a version of ""This Land is Your Land."""
01:21:16;01:21:17;"Wow."
01:21:17;01:21:19;"He's like, ""This land is your land."
01:21:19;01:21:21;"This land is my land."""
01:21:21;01:21:26;"But picture a Burlington, Vermont recording studio in 1987."
01:21:26;01:21:28;"Wait, is this a live video?"
01:21:28;01:21:29;"Oh."
01:21:29;01:21:30;"No, no, no."
01:21:30;01:21:31;"It's an album."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"Yeah."
01:21:32;01:21:33;"Here we go."
01:21:33;01:21:35;"Wait, it's a reggae version?"
01:21:35;01:21:37;"Is this this land?"
01:21:37;01:21:38;"Yeah."
01:21:39;01:21:41;"Bernie Sanders made a reggae-- it's a whole album of reggae?"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"I went walking--"
01:21:43;01:21:44;"No."
01:21:44;01:21:46;"That ribbon of highway."
01:21:46;01:21:48;"I saw above me--"
01:21:48;01:21:49;"So dope."
01:21:49;01:21:50;"That endless skyline."
01:21:50;01:21:52;"This is produced so well."
01:21:52;01:21:55;"I saw below me that golden valley."
01:21:55;01:21:56;"Is it all--"
01:21:56;01:21:59;"I don't know if I can play any more of this because I feel like it's going to hurt his chances."
01:21:59;01:22:00;"No, man, it's awesome."
01:22:00;01:22:02;"OK, we can listen to a little more."
01:22:02;01:22:03;"But is it all speaksing?"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"I know, I haven't heard the whole album."
01:22:05;01:22:08;"This land is your land."
01:22:08;01:22:12;"OK, he had the good sense to get some real singers on the chorus."
01:22:12;01:22:15;"From California to the New York High."
01:22:15;01:22:18;"Oh, yeah, I remember Deez N Marrow did a funny thing about it."
01:22:18;01:22:19;"Are you serious?"
01:22:19;01:22:20;"Wow."
01:22:20;01:22:23;"To the Gulf Stream water."
01:22:23;01:22:26;"Bernie Sanders made a reggae album in the '80s."
01:22:26;01:22:27;"Wow, how did I not know that?"
01:22:27;01:22:30;"You want to know what the top YouTube comment is?"
01:22:30;01:22:31;"What?"
01:22:31;01:22:34;"This is from Levittown Pal Special one month ago."
01:22:34;01:22:36;"""Well, this ruined the song for me."
01:22:36;01:22:40;"Now all I think of when I hear this song is a frail, incompetent socialist"
01:22:40;01:22:44;"surrounded by white, upper-middle-class millennials."""
01:22:44;01:22:46;"Classic YouTube comment."
01:22:46;01:22:49;"Oh, my God."
01:22:49;01:22:52;"As I went walking."
01:22:52;01:22:56;"You know, that's the problem with this era is like, it's cool that Obama's cool."
01:22:56;01:22:57;"Yeah."
01:22:57;01:23:01;"But, you know, he has supported some not-so-great things."
01:23:01;01:23:02;"Absolutely."
01:23:02;01:23:04;"He's far from a perfect president."
01:23:04;01:23:06;"But it's kind of sad."
01:23:06;01:23:13;"Like, you want a dude who's just like such a socialist dork that he's making--"
01:23:13;01:23:16;"like, he has--making like no swag reggae."
01:23:16;01:23:17;"Yep."
01:23:17;01:23:20;"Like, so tone-deaf to the aesthetics of it."
01:23:20;01:23:21;"Right."
01:23:21;01:23:23;"But, like, that's the guy that you believe, like, maybe has some integrity."
01:23:23;01:23:24;"Maybe."
01:23:24;01:23:30;"And just think about, like, summer of '87, a recording studio, like, 50 bucks an hour."
01:23:30;01:23:31;"I don't know what, you know."
01:23:31;01:23:34;"Like, there's some other band, and they're making their demo tape, and Bernie comes in."
01:23:34;01:23:36;"He's like, ""Let's do this, like, kind of reggae."""
01:23:36;01:23:38;"Put this on wax."
01:23:38;01:23:40;"Rig-A-Tinged Pete Seeger songs."
01:23:40;01:23:41;"Oh, I love that it's 1987."
01:23:41;01:23:45;"Imagine if in Straight Outta Compton, they just randomly cut to Burlington, Vermont."
01:23:45;01:23:48;"It's like 1987, like, NWA is killing it."
01:23:48;01:23:50;"And then they're just like, ""Meanwhile, in Burlington, Vermont."""
01:23:50;01:23:54;"And then they just cut to, like, 10 seconds of Bernie, ""As I went walking."""
01:23:54;01:23:56;"That's the film I would make."
01:23:56;01:23:57;"Wow."
01:23:57;01:23:59;"I really appreciate going down this political rabbit hole."
01:23:59;01:24:01;"But it's time to get back into what really matters."
01:24:01;01:24:02;"Awards."
01:24:02;01:24:04;"The Grammys."
01:24:04;01:24:06;"Is the Grammys and awards."
01:24:06;01:24:07;"Really matters."
01:24:07;01:24:14;"So the next song that's nominated for Song of the Year is a song that we've played on this show."
01:24:14;01:24:15;"Not in a while."
01:24:15;01:24:17;"This was in the top five a lot in the summer."
01:24:17;01:24:18;"""Bite Song""?"
01:24:18;01:24:19;"No."
01:24:19;01:24:21;"It's also by a female artist."
01:24:21;01:24:23;"Hmm."
01:24:23;01:24:25;"Adele?"
01:24:25;01:24:26;"No."
01:24:26;01:24:27;"Not eligible."
01:24:27;01:24:28;"Okay, you know what?"
01:24:28;01:24:29;"This is dumb."
01:24:29;01:24:31;"[laughter]"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"Jake, keep guessing."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"Four hours later."
01:24:35;01:24:37;"All right, Jake."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"I'm going to play the music, and then you're going to guess."
01:24:39;01:24:43;"And if you can guess it within five seconds..."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"Oh, that's easy."
01:24:45;01:24:46;"You get the last beer."
01:24:46;01:24:47;"[laughter]"
01:24:52;01:24:53;"For real?"
01:24:53;01:24:54;"Come on."
01:24:54;01:24:55;"Whoa."
01:24:55;01:24:56;"T-Swift."
01:24:56;01:24:57;"Okay."
01:24:57;01:24:58;"What?"
01:24:58;01:24:59;"This is my front runner."
01:24:59;01:25:00;"Didn't know it."
01:25:00;01:25:01;"Wait, you know this song."
01:25:01;01:25:02;"Is this?"
01:25:02;01:25:03;"Oh my God."
01:25:03;01:25:04;"This is your song."
01:25:04;01:25:05;"This is ""Starbucks Lovers."""
01:25:05;01:25:06;"Yeah."
01:25:06;01:25:08;"Jake only remembers this song when you bring up the Starbucks lotto."
01:25:08;01:25:10;"Here we go to the Quiznos."
01:25:10;01:25:12;"Here we go to the Applebee's."
01:25:24;01:25:25;"Okay, we all know this song."
01:25:25;01:25:26;"Taylor Swift, ""Flying to Space."""
01:25:26;01:25:27;"Love this song."
01:25:27;01:25:29;"Also, we should point out today is her birthday."
01:25:29;01:25:30;"Yay, happy birthday, Taylor."
01:25:30;01:25:31;"I love you."
01:25:31;01:25:33;"Happy birthday to Taylor Swift."
01:25:33;01:25:38;"An amazing touring musician that I was lucky enough to go on tour with."
01:25:38;01:25:42;"Oh, yeah, so your 2015 had a lot to do with this person because you went on tour together."
01:25:42;01:25:46;"Yes, I did go on tour with Taylor Swift, and it was awesome."
01:25:46;01:25:49;"So you've seen her rock a crowd of 80,000 with this song."
01:25:49;01:25:53;"Yes, and people go [bleep] nuts to this song."
01:25:53;01:25:58;"This is a definite bring the house down, uh-oh, it's blank space,"
01:25:58;01:26:01;"maybe this stadium is going to collapse, we don't know."
01:26:01;01:26:02;"Well, hold on."
01:26:02;01:26:03;"Wow."
01:26:03;01:26:06;"We're talking about Song of the Year, so we're not just going to shout out Taylor."
01:26:06;01:26:10;"We also have to shout out her co-writers on this song."
01:26:10;01:26:11;"Yes."
01:26:11;01:26:16;"So besides Taylor Swift, also nominated for Song of the Year is Max Martin, legendary Swedish man."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"Yes."
01:26:17;01:26:20;"I think he's produced more number one hits than the Beatles or something."
01:26:20;01:26:23;"Yeah, I mean, I just love that he started with Ace of Base."
01:26:23;01:26:25;"Great, great group."
01:26:25;01:26:29;"And then also working on this song with somebody called Shellback."
01:26:29;01:26:30;"Yes."
01:26:30;01:26:31;"Do you know anything about Shellback?"
01:26:31;01:26:34;"I don't think I know anything about Shellback, but I feel like I should."
01:26:34;01:26:38;"Well, anyway, Max Martin, Shellback, and Taylor Swift, you guys wrote a hell of a song,"
01:26:38;01:26:40;"and guess what, you're nominated for a Grammy."
01:26:40;01:26:41;"Yes, you got the Grammys."
01:26:41;01:26:42;"So good luck."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"I thought that came out late 2014."
01:26:44;01:26:45;"No."
01:26:45;01:26:46;"I think it did."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"This single did."
01:26:47;01:26:48;"I remember hearing it at Christmas."
01:26:48;01:26:49;"Oh, maybe it did."
01:26:49;01:26:50;"It did come out late 2014."
01:26:50;01:26:53;"I'm glad you asked that, Jake, because it's really important that American voters understand"
01:26:53;01:26:54;"how the Grammys work."
01:26:54;01:26:58;"The eligibility period is not the calendar year."
01:26:58;01:26:59;"Oh, it's like a fiscal year."
01:26:59;01:27:00;"It's like the fiscal year."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"It's like the school year or something."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"September is the cutoff?"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"September, the end of September."
01:27:04;01:27:05;"Yes, something like that."
01:27:05;01:27:06;"Gotcha."
01:27:06;01:27:07;"Is the cutoff."
01:27:07;01:27:09;"They really should be teaching this in social studies class."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"I mean."
01:27:10;01:27:13;"The next song nominated for Song of the Year is by an artist."
01:27:13;01:27:14;"It's a song I never heard of."
01:27:14;01:27:17;"It's called Girl Crush, and it's by Little Big Town."
01:27:17;01:27:18;"Do any of you guys know Little Big Town?"
01:27:18;01:27:19;"That's a country."
01:27:19;01:27:20;"Yeah, country vibes."
01:27:20;01:27:23;"I already know this is going to be country, because I feel like the Grammys, they always"
01:27:23;01:27:30;"have to have a country song, because we can't forget that 50% of the United States is country."
01:27:30;01:27:32;"Country genre is such a massive genre."
01:27:32;01:27:33;"It's true."
01:27:33;01:27:36;"A lot of the coastal elites still don't know about it."
01:27:36;01:27:37;"Really?"
01:27:37;01:27:38;"Yep."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"Okay."
01:27:39;01:27:41;"A lot of those Washington liberals don't."
01:27:41;01:27:43;"Bernie Sanders definitely doesn't."
01:27:43;01:27:44;"I love country music."
01:27:44;01:27:45;"No, no, I love it too."
01:27:45;01:27:47;"I don't happen to know these people."
01:27:47;01:27:49;"Here's Little Big Town with Girl Crush."
01:27:50;01:27:58;"That smile and that midnight laugh she's giving you now."
01:27:58;01:28:06;"I want to taste her lips, yeah, 'cause they taste like you."
01:28:06;01:28:15;"I want to drown myself in a bottle of her perfume."
01:28:15;01:28:19;"I want her long, blonde hair."
01:28:19;01:28:23;"I want her magic touch."
01:28:23;01:28:31;"Yeah, 'cause maybe then you'd want me just as much."
01:28:31;01:28:34;"I got a girl crush."
01:28:34;01:28:43;"I got a girl crush."
01:28:43;01:28:47;"I got a girl crush."
01:28:47;01:28:48;"I got a girl crush."
01:28:48;01:28:49;"Hate to admit it, but okay."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"I want to taste her lips, yeah, 'cause they taste like you."
01:28:51;01:28:53;"Oh, wait, what does that mean?"
01:28:53;01:28:54;"There's so many levels to this."
01:28:54;01:28:55;"Oh, wait."
01:28:55;01:28:56;"Okay, okay."
01:28:56;01:29:00;"So she is jealous of the man that she's dating."
01:29:00;01:29:03;"The man's new girlfriend, 'cause she wants to be his girlfriend."
01:29:03;01:29:04;"She wants to be in that place."
01:29:04;01:29:06;"Don't you hate it when you have to figure out lyrics?"
01:29:06;01:29:11;"I mean, we figured it out in like three lines."
01:29:11;01:29:13;"That's pretty good."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"I figured it out in like three lines."
01:29:15;01:29:16;"Okay, so--"
01:29:16;01:29:18;"It's still too early for a gay-themed country song."
01:29:18;01:29:19;"Well, hold on a second, guys."
01:29:19;01:29:22;"You bunch of heteronormative jerks."
01:29:22;01:29:25;"What if she has a girl crush?"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"Well, I guess when you use the phrase ""girl crush""--"
01:29:27;01:29:28;"See, I think that's the thing."
01:29:28;01:29:31;"That's a very heteronormative phrase."
01:29:31;01:29:32;"Right, right, because--"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"It implies everyone's straight."
01:29:34;01:29:37;"Yeah, it's saying that I'm straight, so--"
01:29:37;01:29:40;"Yeah, when you say ""girl crush,"" it implies that a regular crush,"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"'cause it's not like these people call--"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"I don't know why I said ""these people."""
01:29:44;01:29:47;"I'm also a heterosexual person, but--"
01:29:47;01:29:50;"If you said ""regular crush,"" you'd be talking about a guy."
01:29:50;01:29:51;"If you're a woman."
01:29:51;01:29:52;"For instance, you don't say ""I have a boy crush"""
01:29:52;01:29:56;"when you have a romantic crush and you're a heterosexual female."
01:29:56;01:29:59;"That is very desperate."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"We could do a whole episode talking about this song."
01:30:01;01:30:05;"I mean, there's a song that I like by Momis called ""The Haircut of--"""
01:30:05;01:30:07;"or what's it called? ""The Hairstyle of the Devil"" or something,"
01:30:07;01:30:13;"but it has a line, ""The inexplicable charisma of the rival."""
01:30:13;01:30:15;"'Cause you know, a lot of people talk about,"
01:30:15;01:30:18;"with your so-called rivals, your haters,"
01:30:18;01:30:21;"that you're actually obsessed with them, in a way."
01:30:21;01:30:22;"Yes."
01:30:22;01:30:24;"So rather than saying, ""Oh, I don't like this girl"
01:30:24;01:30:26;"""because she's my ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend,"""
01:30:26;01:30:30;"it's weirdly like saying, ""I want to make out with her"
01:30:30;01:30:34;"""as a way of reclaiming you."""
01:30:34;01:30:38;"Well, if this song does win the Grammy for Song of the Year,"
01:30:38;01:30:40;"I will say it's the most complicated."
01:30:40;01:30:41;"Definitely."
01:30:41;01:30:42;"Not really."
01:30:42;01:30:44;"♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ♪"
01:30:44;01:30:48;"♪ And you can tell everybody this is your song ♪"
01:30:48;01:30:50;"Back to the Grammys."
01:30:50;01:30:52;"Well, who gets credit for that song?"
01:30:52;01:30:54;"Okay, so that one's credited to Hillary Lindsay,"
01:30:54;01:30:56;"Lori McKenna, and Liz Rose."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"Okay, so one thing we can say about that song,"
01:30:58;01:31:01;"it's the only nominee that's all female songwriters."
01:31:01;01:31:03;"Although there I go again, assuming that these three people"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"with traditionally female names are female."
01:31:05;01:31:06;"God, I was about to say that."
01:31:06;01:31:07;"I'm glad you caught yourself."
01:31:07;01:31:09;"Yeah, that was stupid of me."
01:31:09;01:31:13;"The number four nominee for Song of the Year--"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"Oh, we haven't heard this one in a minute."

01:31:19;01:31:22;"Oh, this song is so sad."

01:32:36;01:32:37;"I don't know if I'm saying that correctly."

01:32:39;01:32:40;"Yeah."
01:32:40;01:32:43;"Okay, so four men wrote this song together."
01:32:43;01:32:46;"It'd be kind of cool to see a song from a soundtrack win Song of the Year."
01:32:46;01:32:47;"Why?"
01:32:47;01:32:48;"Yeah, why?"
01:32:48;01:32:49;"Has that never happened before?"
01:32:49;01:32:50;"Seems lame."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"Seems lame."
01:32:52;01:32:55;"Well, okay, unlike you guys,"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"who are kind of one media types,"
01:32:57;01:32:58;"who are just like all about music,"
01:32:58;01:33:01;"I actually am very interested in the intersection"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"of various forms of media."
01:33:03;01:33:07;"So when a pop song becomes a hit off the soundtrack of a film,"
01:33:07;01:33:11;"to me that's very interesting from a media studies angle."
01:33:11;01:33:12;"Okay."
01:33:12;01:33:13;"And I think it's powerful."
01:33:13;01:33:16;"I didn't even know it was from a soundtrack."
01:33:16;01:33:17;"Really?"
01:33:17;01:33:18;"Yeah, I just heard it on the radio."
01:33:18;01:33:19;"And did you like it?"
01:33:19;01:33:20;"Did you tear up?"
01:33:20;01:33:23;"Do you think that was during the credits of Fast 7?"
01:33:23;01:33:24;"I didn't see."
01:33:25;01:33:26;"I think it's called--"
01:33:26;01:33:28;"Fast and Furious?"
01:33:28;01:33:31;"People call it Fast, like for shorthand."
01:33:31;01:33:32;"Well, you know, there's many--"
01:33:32;01:33:35;"Among the cast and crew, they just call it Fast."
01:33:35;01:33:37;"You know what's interesting is like that series,"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"it's not Fast and Furious 1, Fast and Furious 2."
01:33:39;01:33:41;"It's like Fast and Furious, then one was called Fast,"
01:33:41;01:33:42;"and the other one was called and Furious,"
01:33:42;01:33:44;"and then one was called Tokyo Drift,"
01:33:44;01:33:46;"and then one was called even more Furious,"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"and then like they all have slightly different names."
01:33:48;01:33:51;"Tokyo Drift has kind of stayed in the lexicon"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"because people are always talking about,"
01:33:53;01:33:55;"""I Tokyo Drifted into this, I Tokyo Drifted into that."""
01:33:55;01:33:56;"Right."
01:33:56;01:33:59;"Because Tokyo Drift is actually a move you can do with your car."
01:33:59;01:34:00;"Oh, what is it?"
01:34:00;01:34:02;"It's like--actually, I don't know."
01:34:02;01:34:04;"I believe it's when you're driving,"
01:34:04;01:34:06;"and then you throw it in neutral,"
01:34:06;01:34:09;"and then the car moves sideways."
01:34:09;01:34:10;"Okay, I'll try it on the way home."
01:34:10;01:34:12;"Can you Tokyo Drift in a Prius?"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"Um..."
01:34:14;01:34:15;"That's what I have."
01:34:15;01:34:17;"I don't know if you can do that in a Prius."
01:34:17;01:34:19;"I feel like there's definitely a YouTube video"
01:34:19;01:34:22;"that is like Tokyo Drift Prius."
01:34:22;01:34:24;"All right, time out."
01:34:24;01:34:27;"Can you Tokyo Drift in a Prius?"
01:34:27;01:34:28;"Let's see."
01:34:28;01:34:30;"I'm typing this into a web browser."
01:34:30;01:34:32;"Oh, Tokyo--wait."
01:34:32;01:34:34;"Prius drifting, lol."
01:34:34;01:34:37;"Okay, this has 10,000 views."
01:34:37;01:34:39;"That is a Prius. Okay."
01:34:39;01:34:41;"Well, I hope this video doesn't end with both of them dying."
01:34:41;01:34:42;"Oh, my God."
01:34:42;01:34:45;"It says ""lol"" at the end of this thing, so..."
01:34:45;01:34:51;"To the people at home who can't hear--"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"who can't see what we're watching,"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"it's a YouTube video."
01:34:55;01:34:57;"It's a young woman."
01:34:57;01:34:58;"Oh, my God, it's kind of scary."
01:34:58;01:35:00;"Oh, he did it!"
01:35:00;01:35:03;"So it's in a dark parking lot."
01:35:03;01:35:05;"It's a little icy."
01:35:05;01:35:08;"And this girl is watching her brother Tokyo Drift..."
01:35:08;01:35:09;"In a Prius."
01:35:10;01:35:11;"Wow, proven."
01:35:11;01:35:12;"Tokyo Drift in a Prius."
01:35:12;01:35:13;"I want to say something, though,"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"before we move on to the next song."
01:35:15;01:35:16;"Don't try that. Don't do that."
01:35:16;01:35:17;"Yeah, don't try that at home."
01:35:17;01:35:20;"Tokyo Drifting is very dangerous."
01:35:20;01:35:22;"You can see that in the movie, Tokyo Drift."
01:35:22;01:35:25;"Do you remember when everybody kept ghost riding the whips and dying?"
01:35:25;01:35:26;"Really?"
01:35:26;01:35:29;"Well, I think because of..."
01:35:29;01:35:30;"Well, I mean, it is very unsafe."
01:35:30;01:35:32;"Well, because of that song, ""Ghost Ride the Whip,"""
01:35:32;01:35:34;"you got more and more knuckleheads trying to ghost--"
01:35:34;01:35:38;"I remember specifically watching a video of a guy ghost riding a pickup truck."
01:35:38;01:35:40;"I ghost-rided a whip once."
01:35:40;01:35:41;"How?"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"I think it was right when that song came out,"
01:35:43;01:35:46;"and me and Esty did it on our residential street."
01:35:46;01:35:48;"Wait, you just got out?"
01:35:48;01:35:50;"Yeah, we just got out and, like, danced."
01:35:50;01:35:52;"But it was also, like, Jewish and erotic,"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"so we got, like, really nervous about it,"
01:35:54;01:35:56;"and I think we, like, lasted three seconds."
01:35:56;01:35:59;"And then we're like, ""Never mind, let's never do that again."""
01:35:59;01:36:02;"People forget that cars are very heavy."
01:36:02;01:36:04;"No, they're very dangerous. I hate cars."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"Living in L.A., it's a very controversial thing to say,"
01:36:06;01:36:07;"but I hate cars."
01:36:07;01:36:08;"They make me angry."
01:36:08;01:36:11;"They're movable death traps."
01:36:11;01:36:13;"Hey, better to have an extreme point of view like that"
01:36:13;01:36:16;"than to pretend that a car is your friend."
01:36:16;01:36:17;"Yeah, no, I hate cars."
01:36:17;01:36:18;"I hate cars."
01:36:18;01:36:19;"I hate driving my--"
01:36:19;01:36:22;"I drove here, and I was so frustrated from the traffic,"
01:36:22;01:36:25;"and especially in traffic, how people drive in traffic."
01:36:25;01:36:27;"It's, like, it's nuts."
01:36:27;01:36:29;"I could go on for years about how much I hate cars."
01:36:29;01:36:31;"Oh, God, I'm thinking about all these, like, awful stories"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"I know about people accidentally killing themselves"
01:36:33;01:36:34;"with their own car."
01:36:34;01:36:35;"Oh, God, let's not get into it."
01:36:35;01:36:36;"Like, you forget to put it--"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"Everybody, drive safe in 2016."
01:36:38;01:36:41;"Especially since it's the holiday season."
01:36:41;01:36:42;"Oh, yeah, just stay home."
01:36:42;01:36:43;"Don't drink and drive."
01:36:43;01:36:44;"Walk."

01:41:51;01:41:52;"You're comparing it to Smokey Robinson."
01:41:52;01:41:55;"That should give you some historical perspective"
01:41:55;01:41:58;"and be able to appropriately judge Ed Sheeran"
01:41:58;01:42:00;"for the mediocre talent that he is."
01:42:00;01:42:01;"All right, Jake, you know what?"
01:42:01;01:42:03;"You're saying a lot of controversial, nasty things,"
01:42:03;01:42:06;"but we'll give you a pass, 'cause you don't mean it."
01:42:06;01:42:08;"You're just thinking out loud."
01:42:08;01:42:11;"Oh!"
01:42:11;01:42:16;"Babylon the Great has fallen."
01:42:16;01:42:17;"So, Emma, you have to leave."
01:42:17;01:42:21;"We got Gerard Carmichael coming up real soon to replace you."
01:42:21;01:42:23;"Maybe you guys can high-five in the hallway."
01:42:23;01:42:24;"Hopefully."
01:42:24;01:42:25;"But just real quick, everybody,"
01:42:25;01:42:29;"I want you to pick what you hope wins Song of the Year."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"Emma?"
01:42:30;01:42:32;"I think I got to go Taylor Swift."
01:42:32;01:42:33;"Taylor Swift, ""Blank Space."""
01:42:33;01:42:34;"Yeah."
01:42:34;01:42:36;"Okay, Baby Haim?"
01:42:36;01:42:38;"I got to go with ""Blank Space,"" yo."
01:42:38;01:42:39;"Taylor Swift."
01:42:39;01:42:40;"She's my girl."
01:42:40;01:42:41;"Two votes for Taylor Swift."
01:42:41;01:42:42;"Jake?"
01:42:42;01:42:43;"Kendrick."
01:42:43;01:42:44;"Kendrick Lamar, all right."
01:42:44;01:42:45;"Yeah."
01:42:45;01:42:46;"How about you, Ezra?"
01:42:46;01:42:47;"I'm going to go Ed Sheeran thinking out loud,"
01:42:47;01:42:49;"because I just can't wait."
01:42:49;01:42:52;"I can't wait to see the look on your face, Jake,"
01:42:52;01:42:56;"when we're at a high-end Grammys viewing party"
01:42:56;01:42:59;"in the Hollywood Hills, sipping on martinis."
01:42:59;01:43:00;"Sounds great."
01:43:00;01:43:04;"And Ed Sheeran hoists up that golden gramophone,"
01:43:04;01:43:07;"looks straight into the camera, and says,"
01:43:07;01:43:08;"""Go to hell, Jake."""
01:43:08;01:43:09;"Yeah."
01:43:09;01:43:10;"""I'm not mediocre."""
01:43:10;01:43:14;"He says, ""For the industry, by the industry."""
01:43:14;01:43:15;"Whoa."
01:43:15;01:43:16;"That's what he says."
01:43:16;01:43:17;"Damn."
01:43:17;01:43:18;"Bye-bye."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"Damn."
01:43:19;01:43:20;"All right, well, see you later, Emma."
01:43:20;01:43:21;"Bye, guys."
01:43:21;01:43:24;"In the meantime, here's some more Ed Sheeran with--"
01:43:24;01:43:25;"Thinking out loud."
01:43:25;01:43:26;"What's a song you like?"
01:43:26;01:43:27;"I like ""Don't."""
01:43:27;01:43:28;"Here's a little more Ed Sheeran."
01:43:28;01:43:31;"Here's the first 30 seconds of Ed Sheeran's ""Don't."""
01:43:31;01:43:33;"[MUSIC - ED SHEERAN, ""DON'T""]"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"(SINGING) La, la, la, la."
01:43:35;01:43:38;"I met this girl late last year."
01:43:38;01:43:40;"She said, don't you worry if I disappear."
01:43:40;01:43:43;"I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait."
01:43:45;01:43:48;"But then I jumped right in a week later returned."
01:43:48;01:43:50;"I reckon she was only looking for her lover to burn."
01:43:50;01:43:53;"But I gave her my time for two or three nights."
01:43:53;01:43:55;"Then I put it on pause until the moment was right."
01:43:55;01:44:00;"I went away four months until our paths crossed again."
01:44:00;01:44:03;"She told me I was never looking for a friend."
01:44:03;01:44:05;"Maybe you could swing by my room around 10."
01:44:05;01:44:07;"Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin."
01:44:07;01:44:10;"We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM."
01:44:10;01:44:12;"Baby, if you wanted me, then you should have just said,"
01:44:12;01:44:13;"she's singing."
01:44:13;01:44:14;"La, la, la, la."
01:44:14;01:44:17;"Don't let go of my love."
01:44:17;01:44:22;"That heart is so cold all over my arm."
01:44:22;01:44:23;"I don't want to know."
01:44:23;01:44:36;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:44:36;01:44:40;"Now, if there's a smile on that face,"
01:44:40;01:44:44;"it's only they're trying to fool the public."
01:44:44;01:44:49;"But when it comes down to fooling you, now, honey,"
01:44:49;01:44:52;"that's quite a different subject."
01:44:52;01:44:56;"You don't let go of my glad expression."
01:44:56;01:44:59;"You've used the wrong impression."
01:44:59;01:45:00;"Really, I'm sad."
01:45:00;01:45:02;"Sad, sad, sad, sad."
01:45:02;01:45:03;"Well, I'm sad."
01:45:03;01:45:04;"I'm sad."
01:45:04;01:45:05;"I'm hurt."
01:45:07;01:45:08;"I'm hurt so bad."
01:45:09;01:45:11;"Like a clown, I pretend to be glad."
01:45:11;01:45:14;"Sad, sad, sad, sad."
01:45:14;01:45:18;"Now, there's some sad things known to men."
01:45:18;01:45:24;"But ain't you glad to see all the tears of a clown"
01:45:24;01:45:27;"when there's no one around?"
01:45:27;01:45:36;"Oh, yeah, baby."
01:45:36;01:45:40;"Now, if I appear to be carefree,"
01:45:40;01:45:44;"it's only to camouflage my sadness."
01:45:44;01:45:49;"In order to shield my pride, I've tried to cover this hurt"
01:45:49;01:45:52;"with a show of gladness."
01:45:52;01:45:55;"You were no love to my show of adventure."
01:45:55;01:46:00;"But I've been happy since you decided to go."
01:46:00;01:46:02;"Why did you go?"
01:46:02;01:46:04;"Oh, I need you so."
01:46:04;01:46:06;"I need you so."
01:46:06;01:46:08;"I heard that I want you to know."
01:46:08;01:46:11;"But for others, I'm not on the show."
01:46:11;01:46:14;"It's just a show."
01:46:14;01:46:17;"Oh, there's some sad things known to men."
01:46:17;01:46:24;"But ain't no one sad to hear the tears of a clown"
01:46:24;01:46:27;"when there's no one around?"
01:46:27;01:46:30;"Oh, yeah."
01:46:30;01:46:37;"Just like Pagliacci did, I try to keep my sadness in."
01:46:37;01:46:41;"But I'm smiling in the club when I'm in crisis."
01:46:41;01:46:47;"In my lonely room, I cry to you for the blues"
01:46:47;01:46:51;"when there's no one around."
01:46:51;01:46:55;"Oh, yeah, baby."
01:46:55;01:46:59;"Now, if someone's calling my name,"
01:46:59;01:47:03;"baby, don't let my care express you."
01:47:03;01:47:07;"I can't lose my aggression."
01:47:07;01:47:10;"Don't let this all outweigh."
01:47:10;01:47:14;"Please make me feel like I'm OK."
01:47:14;01:47:16;"Give me a chance."
01:47:16;01:47:19;"That was Smokey Robinson with ""Tears of a Clown."""
01:47:19;01:47:22;"We've been playing a lot of Smokey and Ed Sheeran"
01:47:22;01:47:23;"on this episode."
01:47:23;01:47:26;"Right now, though, my sister is gone."
01:47:26;01:47:29;"And she has been replaced by my favorite comedian"
01:47:29;01:47:31;"and actor, Dry Carmichael."
01:47:31;01:47:32;"Welcome back to the show."
01:47:32;01:47:34;"You didn't tell me I was replacing family."
01:47:34;01:47:35;"That's true."
01:47:35;01:47:36;"I didn't realize that."
01:47:36;01:47:37;"If you guys passed in the hallway,"
01:47:37;01:47:39;"I didn't realize I was replacing family."
01:47:39;01:47:40;"That's just how it worked out."
01:47:40;01:47:41;"Oh, my God."
01:47:41;01:47:42;"She had to leave."
01:47:42;01:47:43;"She had a dinner."
01:47:43;01:47:44;"Oh, man."
01:47:44;01:47:47;"I mean, I feel like Randy Jackson right now."
01:47:47;01:47:49;"Well, we appreciate having you back."
01:47:49;01:47:51;"Jerrod, last time you were on the show"
01:47:51;01:47:52;"was a couple months ago."
01:47:52;01:47:54;"Yeah, this is fun."
01:47:54;01:47:56;"No, we really appreciate you coming through"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"just to help us close out the show."
01:47:58;01:47:59;"Thanks for having me."
01:47:59;01:48:01;"We've been talking a lot about 2015."
01:48:01;01:48:02;"How was your 2015?"
01:48:02;01:48:03;"It was solid."
01:48:03;01:48:05;"It was a solid 2015."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"I like 2015."
01:48:07;01:48:10;"I'm trying to think about, like,"
01:48:10;01:48:13;"the most eventful things that, you know--"
01:48:13;01:48:14;"I mean, your show."
01:48:14;01:48:15;"Yeah, I started--"
01:48:15;01:48:16;"It started airing."
01:48:16;01:48:18;"Yeah, I started working on my show,"
01:48:18;01:48:21;"and so that was actually most of my 2015."
01:48:21;01:48:23;"It's also--thinking back on it,"
01:48:23;01:48:27;"I realized just how little of a social life I have."
01:48:27;01:48:28;"Really?"
01:48:28;01:48:29;"Yeah, when I just think--I'm thinking back,"
01:48:29;01:48:30;"I'm like, ""Yeah, 'cause 2015, we--"
01:48:30;01:48:31;"Yeah, it kind of worked."
01:48:31;01:48:34;"It was, like, mostly worked."
01:48:34;01:48:36;"Saw a few movies."
01:48:36;01:48:37;"Wait, so what are you doing now?"
01:48:37;01:48:39;"Is the TV show on hiatus?"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"Right, now we're in the thick of it."
01:48:41;01:48:43;"We actually start production in January,"
01:48:43;01:48:45;"so we're in the middle of, like, the writers' room."
01:48:45;01:48:46;"Oh, wow."
01:48:46;01:48:47;"Yeah, piecing together episodes."
01:48:47;01:48:48;"What did you think--I don't know if you guys"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"watched The Wiz live on NBC a couple weeks ago."
01:48:50;01:48:52;"Yeah, David Alan Grier."
01:48:52;01:48:53;"So I was thinking about that,"
01:48:53;01:48:54;"because David Alan Grier,"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"who was my favorite part of The Wiz,"
01:48:56;01:48:57;"played the lion."
01:48:57;01:48:58;"Did you see it?"
01:48:58;01:48:59;"Did you see your TV father?"
01:48:59;01:49:00;"Oh, I saw him."
01:49:00;01:49:02;"Dressed up like that with his lion dreads?"
01:49:02;01:49:04;"Lion dreads--he crushed it, by the way."
01:49:04;01:49:06;"There was this, like, New York Times article."
01:49:06;01:49:09;"There was, like, a love letter to David,"
01:49:09;01:49:10;"and rightfully so."
01:49:10;01:49:13;"He was, like--he had, like, tears in his eyes at one point."
01:49:13;01:49:16;"I was like, ""I never cared about the lion."""
01:49:16;01:49:19;"It was--the lion was always my least favorite"
01:49:19;01:49:22;"in every incarnation of it."
01:49:22;01:49:24;"Like, the Wizard of Oz, The Wiz--"
01:49:24;01:49:27;"like, always my least favorite."
01:49:27;01:49:29;"Because you can't stand cowards?"
01:49:29;01:49:31;"Yeah, exactly."
01:49:31;01:49:33;"Who likes cowards?"
01:49:33;01:49:34;"Don't you feel bad for him?"
01:49:34;01:49:35;"No!"
01:49:35;01:49:36;"He's a lion."
01:49:36;01:49:37;"You got claws and teeth."
01:49:37;01:49:38;"Like, here's the thing."
01:49:38;01:49:39;"If we're really--"
01:49:39;01:49:41;"in true jungle sense,"
01:49:41;01:49:43;"like, that lion should have been, like,"
01:49:43;01:49:45;"murdered years ago."
01:49:45;01:49:47;"He should have never made it to Oz."
01:49:47;01:49:48;"You know what I mean?"
01:49:48;01:49:49;"Like, just like--"
01:49:49;01:49:51;"you're a frightened lion?"
01:49:51;01:49:52;"Well, good luck in the jungle."
01:49:52;01:49:53;"You know what I mean?"
01:49:53;01:49:55;"But--so I've always hated the lion."
01:49:55;01:49:56;"Always despised it."
01:49:56;01:50:00;"And David--it took the brilliance of David Allen Greer"
01:50:00;01:50:02;"to make me care about the lion."
01:50:02;01:50:04;"He really was the standout."
01:50:04;01:50:07;"And also, like, good dancer."
01:50:07;01:50:09;"Solid dancer."
01:50:09;01:50:11;"So, Jerrod, what is your song of 2015?"
01:50:11;01:50:13;"Tried to give this a lot of thought."
01:50:13;01:50:15;"Yeah, yeah, I know I texted you kind of last minute."
01:50:15;01:50:16;"Yeah, I really did."
01:50:16;01:50:19;"And I was telling you, like, I don't--"
01:50:19;01:50:22;"I discover songs, like, late or randomly."
01:50:22;01:50:26;"We live in a giant best-of mixtape."
01:50:26;01:50:28;"That's what society is right now."
01:50:28;01:50:33;"Like, it's literally all of the times at one time right now."
01:50:33;01:50:35;"Like, it's just like--I got a friend that dresses like"
01:50:35;01:50:38;"it's the '60s and other friends that listen to records"
01:50:38;01:50:40;"and other friends that--a friend that has a flat top"
01:50:40;01:50:42;"and is just like, ""Where are--"""
01:50:42;01:50:45;"If you--if someone time-traveled from, like, any period"
01:50:45;01:50:47;"to right now, depending on the neighborhood,"
01:50:47;01:50:49;"you wouldn't know what year it is."
01:50:49;01:50:50;"All that--"
01:50:50;01:50:51;"Right."
01:50:51;01:50:54;"Saying that, I mean, I think Kendrick's--"
01:50:54;01:50:56;"Kendrick Lamar was perfect."
01:50:56;01:50:59;"I think ""The Pimple Butterfly"" was, like, fantastic."
01:50:59;01:51:03;"And my favorite--probably my favorite song that most played"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"is--it's not even a song technically."
01:51:05;01:51:09;"It's the interlude, like, for sale off that album,"
01:51:09;01:51:12;"I think is just great."

01:54:45;01:54:48;"- At the beginning that voice was like, what's wrong?"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"I thought you was keeping it gangsta."
01:54:50;01:54:52;"It's my favorite thing in the world."
01:54:52;01:54:55;"I actually say this to myself in the bathroom mirror a lot."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"- What's the situation in the bathroom"
01:54:57;01:54:58;"in which you say that to yourself?"
01:54:58;01:54:59;"- Yeah."
01:54:59;01:55:03;"- Anytime you are slightly bitten by success."
01:55:03;01:55:06;"Like meaning like when the byproduct"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"just becomes any source of frustration."
01:55:08;01:55:10;"Like, you know, like you, you, you know, you go out"
01:55:10;01:55:13;"and you want people to watch and, you know,"
01:55:13;01:55:15;"be invested in you, but then sometimes"
01:55:15;01:55:16;"they show you the worst part of you"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"and you got to deal with that, but it comes with it."
01:55:18;01:55:21;"And so just in my bathroom mirror, like when I'm dealing,"
01:55:21;01:55:25;"after some conference call that I'm angered by"
01:55:25;01:55:28;"or a family member that starts treating you differently"
01:55:28;01:55:31;"because of something, you're just like, what's wrong?"
01:55:31;01:55:32;"I thought you was kidding."
01:55:32;01:55:34;"I thought this is what you wanted."
01:55:34;01:55:36;"- So for you, when, when you have a moment,"
01:55:36;01:55:39;"need a moment of soul searching, dealing with something,"
01:55:39;01:55:43;"the place in your house you go to is, is the bathroom mirror."
01:55:43;01:55:45;"You don't, you don't flop face down on the bed."
01:55:45;01:55:46;"- No, no, no."
01:55:46;01:55:47;"You got to stare at yourself."
01:55:47;01:55:48;"You got to deal with your problems face on."
01:55:48;01:55:49;"- You're, you're a stronger man than I."
01:55:49;01:55:50;"- Face on, man."
01:55:50;01:55:51;"- I hate looking in the mirror."
01:55:51;01:55:52;"- Really?"
01:55:52;01:55:53;"- I like to flop down on the bed."
01:55:53;01:55:55;"- Well, it's all about, you know, it's, it's all about,"
01:55:55;01:55:57;"you know, eye, make eye contact with yourself."
01:55:57;01:55:58;"Deal with it."
01:55:58;01:55:59;"What are you doing?"
01:55:59;01:56:01;"Like, what are you doing out there?"
01:56:01;01:56:02;"- I like that."
01:56:02;01:56:05;"Um, well, one last music fact before we wrap it up."
01:56:05;01:56:09;"Um, I was watching a CINAHL this weekend and I was like,"
01:56:09;01:56:12;"I want to read more about Leon Bridges because he was,"
01:56:12;01:56:13;"he was a musical guest."
01:56:13;01:56:14;"- He was on, I didn't see, yeah."
01:56:14;01:56:16;"- And I looked and I was like, and I looked him up"
01:56:16;01:56:19;"and, um, his, uh, birth name is Todd Bridges."
01:56:19;01:56:20;"- Really?"
01:56:20;01:56:21;"- And I was like, oh."
01:56:21;01:56:24;"- And, and he decided to become an artist."
01:56:24;01:56:25;"He was like, can't do that."
01:56:25;01:56:26;"- Don't want to be Todd Bridges."
01:56:26;01:56:27;"- Can't, can't."
01:56:27;01:56:29;"- I like the name Todd."
01:56:29;01:56:30;"- Yeah."
01:56:30;01:56:31;"- No, no, but there already is a Todd Bridges"
01:56:31;01:56:32;"and he's very famous."
01:56:32;01:56:33;"- Oh, I didn't even know that."
01:56:33;01:56:35;"- Oh yeah, he was on Different Strokes."
01:56:35;01:56:36;"- Yeah."
01:56:36;01:56:37;"- Oh, that was before my time."
01:56:37;01:56:38;"- Willis."
01:56:38;01:56:39;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:56:39;01:56:40;"- Willis on Different Strokes, yeah."
01:56:40;01:56:43;"- This was the last regular season Time Crisis of 2015."
01:56:43;01:56:45;"We got a Christmas special coming up."
01:56:45;01:56:46;"- Oh."
01:56:46;01:56:48;"- I think that's just going to be me and Jake"
01:56:48;01:56:51;"cracking some brews, playing some Christmas tunes,"
01:56:51;01:56:53;"maybe make a couple phone calls."
01:56:53;01:56:54;"If you're not busy on Christmas Day,"
01:56:54;01:56:56;"you can tune into a very special Time Crisis."
01:56:56;01:56:59;"Anyway, I want to thank everybody who listened to 2015."
01:56:59;01:57:02;"I want to give a shout out to the artist named..."
01:57:02;01:57:04;"- Dan Howden."
01:57:04;01:57:08;"- Dan Howden, who made an amazing Time Crisis print"
01:57:08;01:57:10;"that Jake brought in and had framed,"
01:57:10;01:57:11;"so shout out to you."
01:57:11;01:57:13;"We'll have a photo up on Connect."
01:57:13;01:57:16;"I want to thank all my guests, my sister Emma, who's gone."
01:57:16;01:57:19;"Jake Longstreth, as always."
01:57:19;01:57:21;"Alana Haim, first time on the show."
01:57:21;01:57:23;"I've been trying to get you on this show for a long time."
01:57:23;01:57:25;"- I know, I'm too busy in this dude."
01:57:25;01:57:26;"- I've been trying to get you on this show"
01:57:26;01:57:28;"for such a long time."
01:57:28;01:57:29;"- I didn't believe that."
01:57:29;01:57:30;"- I was too busy, and finally I picked up the phone."
01:57:30;01:57:33;"I called Zane Lowe, I said, ""Give this girl a show."""
01:57:33;01:57:34;"- Thank you."
01:57:34;01:57:36;"- Because maybe that'll help me get her on my show."
01:57:36;01:57:38;"- It's all because of you that Haim Time exists."
01:57:38;01:57:40;"- And I also picked up the phone,"
01:57:40;01:57:42;"and I called Columbia Records, and I said,"
01:57:42;01:57:44;"""Let these girls make a second album."""
01:57:44;01:57:46;"- Yep. - Come on."
01:57:46;01:57:48;"- Haim basically falls in your hands."
01:57:48;01:57:50;"- Was all this done on a Sunday?"
01:57:50;01:57:52;"- Yeah, this was actually all done 10 minutes ago."
01:57:52;01:57:53;"- It was all done on a Sunday."
01:57:53;01:57:56;"I'm just, you know, I just feel a sense of..."
01:57:56;01:57:59;"I'm like the original Haim fan club president."
01:57:59;01:58:00;"- Well, I hope I did okay on your show."
01:58:00;01:58:01;"- No, no, you were amazing."
01:58:01;01:58:02;"We truly appreciate having you here."
01:58:02;01:58:03;"- Thank you, Bethel."
01:58:03;01:58:05;"- And then, of course, Gerard coming in,"
01:58:05;01:58:06;"bottom of the ninth."
01:58:06;01:58:08;"- Yes."
01:58:08;01:58:09;"- They don't call me the Derek Jeter"
01:58:09;01:58:12;"of this show for no reason."
01:58:12;01:58:13;"- Wonderful having you back."
01:58:13;01:58:14;"Now that you've been on two shows..."
01:58:14;01:58:15;"- Yes."
01:58:15;01:58:18;"- You're officially in the ""Time Crisis"""

01:58:20;01:58:22;"Which I think doesn't include that many people."
01:58:22;01:58:24;"- But it does come with a taco."
01:58:24;01:58:26;"- It comes with a taco. - Yeah."
01:58:26;01:58:27;"- Taco Tuesday. - Taco Tuesday."

01:58:33;01:58:35;"- Yes."
