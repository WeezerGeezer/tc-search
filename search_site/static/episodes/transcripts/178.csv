00:37;00:39;"Oh"
00:45;00:49;"But everything seems so"
01:13;01:16;"Time crisis back again"
01:16;01:21;"We're in the dog days of summer. I don't know when this is airing for all I know"
01:21;01:27;"This is the Halloween episode, but we're banking the Epps. We're taking our summer vacations"
01:27;01:30;"We're working all over the world. We're traveling"
01:30;01:35;"I just got back from Cleveland did not get to go to the the rock hall bummer"
01:35;01:40;"Although it did seem like from the text thread that you were choosing not to attend"
01:40;01:45;"Yeah, I specifically chose not to attend you were in the vicinity. I was in walking distance"
01:45;01:52;"I was kicking in the text. I'm very close and I'm not gonna go. Here's why I was a bit jet-lagged"
01:52;01:54;"been zipping all over the place and"
01:54;01:59;"Would you say weak? Yeah weak weak excuse"
01:59;02:02;"Hold on it gets better"
02:02;02:06;"Not only was I jet-lagged and I had this show in Cleveland that night"
02:06;02:12;"We're actually just outside of Cleveland in the greater Cleveland area. It was Sunday. And so, you know, I was like"
02:12;02:17;"Waking up late, you know, I'm thinking about the show if it had been a weekday"
02:17;02:23;"I totally would have rolled over but I like Google Rock and Roll Hall of Fame says, you know on Google"
02:23;02:25;"It says like this time of day. It's"
02:25;02:30;"Very busy and I was like, you know what? I'd love to go pay tribute to"
02:31;02:36;"Rock and roll crates. I would love to see Rod Stewart's scarf and all that cool stuff"
02:36;02:39;"But there's some I just pictured it being like slammed on a Sunday"
02:39;02:46;"Just being like kind of like tired and out of it and just being alone at the rock hall on a Sunday"
02:46;02:53;"Just like families and I don't know that sounded that sounded unappealing. Maybe someone spotting you there"
02:53;02:59;"Right, which should also be pretty funny. Hey, aren't you playing tonight? Yep. Are you here by yourself?"
03:01;03:08;"That's right every time I'm in Cleveland I walk over here and I I leave a little note for myself in 20 years I"
03:08;03:12;"Hide a little note for myself in 20 years"
03:12;03:18;"Says, uh, welcome to the hall bro. That's like my Matthew McConaughey speech. It wasn't the day"
03:18;03:22;"Hopefully next time I'm in Cleveland, it'll be like a Tuesday. I'll be on a normal schedule"
03:22;03:28;"I'll roll over there like 11 a.m. On a Tuesday. Where is the open? That sounds like the perfect day"
03:28;03:34;"I bet the concessions at the rock hall are pretty tight. Just picturing that museum restaurant. Ooh"
03:34;03:40;"Actually, I think cuz you know up you go to like an art museum the art museum restaurant"
03:40;03:43;"It's like kind of highbrow, you know"
03:43;03:49;"It's like you're not gonna get like a cheeseburger at like the Metropolitan Museum of Art cafeteria"
03:49;03:51;"It's gonna be like, you know"
03:51;03:57;"Like a tuna salad or like a nice like a classy kind of salad or and even if it's not good"
03:57;04:03;"They're still going to try to present it as elevated almost like an airport restaurant"
04:03;04:05;"Where there's like, you know"
04:05;04:10;"There's an airport restaurant that's kind of come fill your belly at the at the feed station and then you go to some place"
04:10;04:16;"That's branded as like a nicer place and it's basically all the same food. Yeah, so I'm just picturing Rock Hall"
04:16;04:19;"you get like double cheeseburger and like"
04:20;04:26;"16 ounce Budweiser. I mean there really should be like a yard house on site"
04:26;04:29;"Absolutely. That's part of the rock all"
04:29;04:35;"Great food classic rock according to their website to Rock Hall. I mean, come on"
04:35;04:40;"According to the website Rock Hall. I'm looking at I'm trying to find the menu, but this is funny"
04:40;04:48;"Rock Hall members receive 10% discount in the cafe like being a member like if you"
04:48;04:52;"Just happen to live in Cleveland and like well, there's a great resource here in the city"
04:52;04:59;"I wonder does the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame have like a library the scholars go like post up there. I doubt it"
04:59;05:03;"I'm thinking about a little bit just because I've been and we're gonna talk about Bob Dylan later"
05:03;05:10;"But ever since I I went to the Bob Dylan show that Jake helped me score a ticket to even though Jake was not in attendance"
05:10;05:15;"I was not able to attend which was a bummer. But whatever moving on I rolled with the other longstreth"
05:16;05:18;"There's one longstreth is in attendance Dave"
05:18;05:25;"But I've just been like thinking about Bob a lot listening to deeper Bob stuff reading about Bob and I've seen a lot of references"
05:25;05:31;"In recent writing about him in the past five years or something to the fact that he like sold his archive"
05:31;05:34;"to a"
05:34;05:40;"University or a library or something in Tulsa, Oklahoma, right Bob has no specific connection at Tulsa"
05:40;05:43;"Obviously, he's from Minnesota and he's lived in New York and Malibu"
05:43;05:49;"but I think it's like a local Tulsa businessman is maybe like a huge Dylan head and"
05:49;05:54;"He wanted the honor of having the official Dylan archive in"
05:54;05:59;"Tulsa and I guess like really hardcore Dylan fans will roll to Tulsa"
05:59;06:04;"Just to kind of see it and I apparently there's some good stuff in there. There's like never-before-seen footage"
06:04;06:10;"early versions of lyrics and all sorts of writings and scraps and stuff, but I guess um"
06:11;06:19;"You know like hardcore Dylan scholars will go to Tulsa for like two three weeks just to like go through all this stuff like by hand"
06:19;06:22;"So surely if you know, obviously Bob Dylan"
06:22;06:29;"Maybe is like uniquely this kind of literary figure that people love to write about and pour over his lyrics"
06:29;06:36;"But if that's happening at the Bob Dylan archive in Tulsa, I'd imagine that there's some equivalent at the Rock Hall"
06:36;06:41;"Like maybe there's like some British music journalist who like lives in Newcastle"
06:41;06:48;"Who's just like all right going to Cleveland for three weeks. I'll be digging in the archives of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"
06:48;06:55;"I'll be eating at the cafeteria three meals a day, you know, just like posting up because I guess that's what scholars do at"
06:55;07:01;"Universities and stuff, right? I'm gonna get a membership to the Rock Hall so I can get that 10% off in the cafeteria"
07:01;07:04;"Let me tell you it's gonna more than pay for itself"
07:04;07:10;"Let me tell you absolutely the Yelp reviews of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame cafe"
07:10;07:15;"Not positive this one actually from Alex S and Needham Heights"
07:15;07:21;"Massachusetts does or need my it's Maine. Sorry does actually sound like Jake wrote it"
07:21;07:26;"It says one star, please do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else literally anywhere else"
07:26;07:32;"It's a typical reheat situation a flavorless craft crap at a hefty price. I like a typical"
07:32;07:39;"The cheese steaks from Markel and Whittier, California the cheese steaks"
07:39;07:43;"I would even I ordered were awful took a few bites and threw them in the garbage"
07:43;07:45;"Wow for the prices"
07:45;07:53;"I wonder I don't even cook cooking on site if they're just like getting like precooked and prepared hamburgers and cheese steaks"
07:54;07:59;"Delivered like in packaging and then just pop it in a microwave. That's like a weird weird high school cafeteria"
07:59;08:07;"Situation where yeah, everything's like frozen or you just heat it up for safety concerns. We're not licensed to actually"
08:07;08:10;"operate a grill or an open flame"
08:10;08:17;"well, you know what it is because the it's like all of all of the ephemera in history that's in that building is so"
08:17;08:22;"Priceless right the 38 special archives are so priceless"
08:23;08:26;"That they can't risk having an open flame in the building"
08:26;08:28;"See"
08:28;08:30;"You"
08:30;08:32;"Love"
08:33;08:35;"Oh"
08:35;08:37;"You"
08:38;08:40;"Me"
08:40;08:42;"Oh"
09:11;09:14;"A lot of those Yelp reviewers have an axe to grind though"
09:14;09:18;"And so, you know, I would say look at this objectively"
09:18;09:21;"Cleveland's renowned chefs Rocco Whalen"
09:21;09:28;"Fabio Salerno and Jonathan Sawyer all put their heart and soul into the menu and they all have thriving prize-winning"
09:28;09:34;"Restaurants in Cleveland to beyond I look at these men's faces and I see heart and soul here"
09:34;09:39;"And so I would say don't put too much stock into those Yelp Yelp reviews. I see quality in this menu"
09:39;09:45;"But it's so funny how because you always see this with airlines to that the way in which"
09:45;09:48;"Food has become branded you go to some place"
09:48;09:55;"You're on a plane or something and there's some reference to some like high-end chef who has like a five-star restaurant somewhere"
09:55;10:01;"But if they always use really vague language because like of course the chef didn't literally prepare it there"
10:01;10:06;"They're not on the plane and maybe they didn't even like train anybody to make it"
10:06;10:10;"they probably just like sent some vague instructions of"
10:10;10:15;"Like have they even tasted it because I've noticed this phrase popping up here and there chef inspired"
10:15;10:21;"It's like some real like weasel words some real 1984. Yeah, I feel like you'll see like a"
10:21;10:26;"Wolfgang Puck restaurant at the airport. Oh, definitely. Yeah, and it's like the airport"
10:26;10:33;"That's just like some Trump stuff you license your name. You know what actually that reminds me. Yeah one and chef inspired. It's just like"
10:35;10:37;"Chef inspired"
10:37;10:42;"Like presumably all food is chef inspired and that like a chef probably originated"
10:42;10:47;"But what does that mean chef inspired but that reminds me too because I was talking with um, Bayo"
10:47;10:51;"when we were in Cleveland because he caught a"
10:51;10:57;"Mark Wahlberg Chevy license plate in the wild Oh tight"
10:57;11:04;"Have we ever talked about this that mark that there's a series of Chevy dealerships in Ohio that are Mark Wahlberg dealerships"
11:05;11:08;"He's the name on the dealership. Why Ohio?"
11:08;11:13;"It's a great question and it's I feel like there's the type of thing like every time I'm in Ohio"
11:13;11:19;"I'm reminded of it and then I research it and then I forget again and then I get back there and I"
11:19;11:25;"See Mark Wahlberg and like yeah, why Ohio? He's like, I mean, obviously he probably lives in the Hollywood Hills now"
11:25;11:32;"But I lives in Bel Air famously. He's from Boston. Of course, maybe there was an opening in the market"
11:32;11:35;"maybe there was like a big dealership a guy that owned like a"
11:35;11:41;"Some guy owned like nine Chevy dealerships in Ohio that was either going out of business"
11:41;11:47;"Retiring didn't feel comfortable leaving it to his like idiot son and was like, you know what? I'm just gonna sell everything"
11:47;11:52;"Well, let's put it out there. This is like a unique opportunity. That's a good guess"
11:52;11:58;"You're partially right because I looked it up and basically well, first of all, I guess Mark Wahlberg. He's like crazy about business"
11:58;12:06;"He's got Wahlburgers with his brothers and not only do they have Wahlburgers everywhere. They even have a TV show about it"
12:06;12:08;"I think he's got a clothing line"
12:08;12:14;"Obviously, he's got the movies and stuff. He's a big investor in this like Catholic app"
12:14;12:20;"Or something. He's a true businessman. We have to watch father stew. What's that?"
12:20;12:23;"That is new movie father still is like a new Catholic movie"
12:23;12:31;"He made this year where he plays like a badass Catholic priests. Really? Anyway, I'm tangenting. Okay, so but just"
12:31;12:33;"looked it up and"
12:33;12:38;"Basically, he met a Midwestern like local billionaire type dude"
12:38;12:44;"You know like a guy who I think maybe from Michigan a Midwestern businessman from Detroit"
12:44;12:50;"Oh Detroit based businessman who is investing his money in some Wahlburgers"
12:50;12:56;"So he's out there trying to get Wahlburgers off the ground and he meets this guy Jay Feldman. Oh, his name is Jay Feldman"
12:56;12:58;"Yeah, you know"
12:58;13:04;"Not personally just like his reputation precedes him. So I guess part of how Jay Feldman made his"
13:04;13:09;"Billions is by owning car dealerships, although I imagine the Jay Feldman"
13:09;13:16;"Empires, you know, you got burger restaurants who knows I mean this guy is a true businessman"
13:16;13:20;"So I guess he met mark they hit it off. He's a proud"
13:20;13:26;"Investor in Wahlburgers and then they're just talking about their passion for making money and at some point"
13:26;13:32;"Lightbulb goes off for Jay and he's like well mark you're this famous guy. Why don't we do some car dealerships together?"
13:32;13:37;"And from what I've read it's unclear if there if it's anything beyond him saying to mark"
13:37;13:43;"Listen, you throw your name on this do a little bit of promo. I'll give you a cut of the profits"
13:43;13:50;"It might be as simple as that, but it definitely made me think a bit about how often is Mark Wahlberg going to Ohio?"
13:50;13:52;"He got national press about this"
13:52;13:53;"I think you know"
13:53;13:57;"He's probably going on Jimmy Fallon and and he made sure like that was one of the things he gets"
13:57;14:01;"Yes, so Mark was this is about you gotta get some Chevy dealerships in Ohio"
14:01;14:05;"I'm cars now and Mark's like no actually yeah"
14:05;14:11;"No, I got I got a few shout out to Columbus come through if you need a Chevy and I guess it's as simple as that"
14:11;14:15;"But I'm willing to believe that he and Jay Feldman have a real friendship"
14:15;14:19;"And but it kind of sounds like he just basically said alright use my name"
14:19;14:23;"Give me some money use my name and then you have this kind of like nonsensical thing"
14:23;14:30;"Mark Wahlberg Chevy like normally when you drive past a dealership you see the name you think alright well that that guy"
14:30;14:37;"Whatever his name is is probably sitting in an office in this building that I'm driving past or if he's not"
14:37;14:39;"He'll be there later this afternoon"
14:39;14:45;"And he probably occasionally sells a car on the floor, and he's the boss you know at least you're like"
14:45;14:46;"That's why the name is on there"
14:46;14:46;"Yeah"
14:46;14:51;"But this is like this like a Hollywood celebrity throwing their name on it like they have to have a photo"
14:51;14:57;"I gotta find this they must have a photo of a one of your driving through Columbus, and you saw Mark Wahlberg's"
14:57;15:06;"Toyota dealership you just assume that there's just another Martin you couldn't possibly assume that it's daddy's home"
15:07;15:10;"Mark Wahlberg, it's Dirk Diggler himself"
15:10;15:17;"You think it's just a local, Ohio dude named Mark Wahlberg especially because that name is like very plausibly"
15:17;15:24;"There's probably a Mark Wahlberg in every shirt. Yeah, there's got to be more than one so yeah, it's not the Benicio del Toro"
15:24;15:27;"Chevy dealership in"
15:27;15:30;"Columbus, Ohio"
15:30;15:34;"Flat 41 with my strap by the door"
15:34;15:38;"We was going to the country for what we came for"
15:38;15:42;"I'm sure you smell the trees in the air"
15:42;15:47;"The best of all the cruises just a joy to get there"
15:47;15:56;"I was approaching Silverton down by the cotton chair"
15:56;16:00;"There was all my work but John the black man"
16:00;16:04;"Yes if I was there, why then if I need a desk"
16:04;16:09;"I said no thanks anyhow I don't drive too fast"
16:09;16:17;"Hallelujah, Hallelujah"
16:17;16:21;"Ride my Chevrolet"
16:21;16:25;"Hallelujah, Hallelujah"
16:25;16:29;"Ride my Chevrolet"
16:29;16:33;"You know the Wahlberg called the connection he has with Feldman a brotherly bond"
16:33;16:40;"They're the same age both married with children Feldman has two kids Wahlberg has four at least the time writing Detroit Free Pass"
16:40;16:46;"They possess a compulsive motivation to succeed and despite their distance Feldman"
16:46;16:51;"We write Feldman in Oakland County, Michigan Wahlberg in Beverly Hills"
16:51;16:55;"The two visit each other several times a year travel together and communicate almost daily"
16:55;17:00;"I've totally by that that their boys and their friends and they vacation together"
17:00;17:06;"I want how often are they traveling to Ohio together is what I'd like to know is Mark visiting all the dealerships"
17:06;17:11;"Is he looking at the books a quarterly walkthrough? How and how involved in the business is he?"
17:11;17:17;"There's no way he's doing quarterly maybe once a year maybe once every other year"
17:17;17:24;"He probably zooms in you can do a lot remotely these days. It's just sort of funny to think how often is he making it to Columbus?"
17:24;17:32;"I mean, maybe he lives for it. Maybe he loves you just gets on the PJ stops by if anybody works at a Mark Wahlberg dealership"
17:32;17:38;"Love to hear from you. I wonder yeah, maybe he get he gets on zoom once a month and does like kind of a punt"
17:38;17:45;"He tells a funny story about Hollywood and then does like a pump-up now get out there and sell some cars this story of"
17:45;17:50;"How their friendship formed from the Feldman Auto website is pretty good"
17:50;17:57;"Jay Feldman and Mark Wahlberg met to discuss the idea of Feldman teaming up with Wahlberg to bring a Wahlberg Wahl burgers to Michigan"
17:57;18:03;"But this lunch was only the second time Feldman and Wahlberg had ever met their first encounter"
18:03;18:11;"Just a few weeks prior was a brief handshake when Wahlberg was in Detroit filming Transformers little did either of them know"
18:11;18:19;"That that handshake would lead to a multi-million dollar Empire together that includes several restaurants and a car dealership"
18:19;18:25;"Along the way. They've also developed a deep friendship. And here's a quote from Mark about Jay"
18:25;18:32;"Jay's experience in the car business attracted me even though we got into restaurants first, but I've always been a big car guy"
18:32;18:37;"And he's very reputable. He's just a good guy a great family man, and we hit it off right away"
18:37;18:42;"Can you believe it just from a brief handshake? Wow, they were vibing"
18:42;18:43;"That's a great inspiration"
18:43;18:49;"if there's anybody out there who's maybe shooting a movie in a town that you're not from and there's a"
18:49;18:54;"Prominent local businessman and you're a little bit nervous. Should I go shoot my shot and shake this guy's hand?"
18:54;19:02;"I think we just answered your question go for it. There's literally a classic best show call called Gene Simmons Toyota"
19:02;19:12;"Oh, right. I've sent it to you guys. It's like from 20 years ago Wow, and it's basically Gene is open to Toyota dealership in Newbridge, New Jersey"
19:12;19:19;"Tom calls the dealership and talks to Chet one of the floor managers who's in business with Gene"
19:19;19:24;"And they just really get into the brass tacks of a dealership ahead of their time as always"
19:24;19:30;"Gene Simmons Toyota and now we got Mark Wahlberg Chevy. It all makes sense"
19:30;19:36;"Shout out to everybody who came to that festival in Cleveland whenever that was whenever this is airing"
19:36;19:42;"That was a lot of fun. Great crowd. Sorry. I just wanted to interject one last thing about the Rock Hall"
19:42;19:51;"There was a funny story that was sent to me yesterday by my buddy Michael Azarad that one of the quote curators of the Rock Hall has just been indicted"
19:51;19:58;"For possessing stolen lyrics and memorabilia from Don Henley and trying to sell them"
19:58;20:04;"Right. Yeah, I heard about this. Illicitly on the black rock market"
20:04;20:09;"I think it's three guys got from the three Rock Hall guys got sucked into this"
20:09;20:13;"They've been kicked off the board. I just like the term curator"
20:13;20:20;"Again, it's a very like fancy museum word and I love being a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame curator"
20:20;20:26;"It's just like it gave me a real sad feeling about the Rock because we've been talking about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"
20:26;20:33;"On and off now for a bunch of episodes and here we are reading Yelp reviews of their terrible sounding restaurant"
20:33;20:42;"And I just think about the curator possessing the it was the handwritten Don Henley lyrics to Hotel California"
20:42;20:47;"Which really would be a major major rock ephemera really top shelf stuff"
20:47;20:53;"How much could that possibly be worth? Well, they said in the article like a million which I totally buy"
20:53;21:00;"Yeah, of course. Yeah some billionaire somewhere maybe Jay Feldman ready to drop a cool million on"
21:00;21:07;"One of the greatest songs of all time handwritten. Sure. Who knows you find the right person you could sell that for five million"
21:07;21:12;"It really did you need a mo you had to find a motivated buyer who knows be a million easy"
21:12;21:15;"On a dark desert highway"
21:15;21:18;"Cool wind in my hair"
21:18;21:22;"Warm smell of polydust"
21:22;21:25;"Rising up through the air"
21:25;21:28;"Up ahead in the distance"
21:28;21:31;"I saw a shimmering light"
21:31;21:35;"My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim"
21:35;21:38;"I had to stop for the night"
21:38;21:41;"There she stood in the doorway"
21:41;21:45;"I heard the mission bell"
21:45;21:51;"I was thinking to myself this could be heaven and this could be hell"
21:51;21:54;"Then she lit up a candle"
21:54;21:57;"And she showed me the way"
21:57;22:01;"There were voices down the corridor"
22:01;22:04;"I thought I heard them say"
22:04;22:10;"Welcome to the Hotel California"
22:10;22:13;"Such a lovely place"
22:13;22:17;"Such a lovely face"
22:17;22:23;"Plenty of room at the Hotel California"
22:23;22:26;"Any time of year"
22:26;22:28;"You can find it here"
22:28;22:35;"I would love to know more about this guy or this group of guys who are trying to sell this because I mean"
22:35;22:39;"Yeah, how often does that happen? Does that happen in all types of museums?"
22:39;22:43;"Jake you got a you're part of the fine art world. Have you ever heard of like, you know"
22:43;22:49;"Somebody like the Philadelphia Museum of Art like a curator in the kind of legit high art space"
22:49;22:52;"Getting in trouble for trying to make an extra buck?"
22:52;22:54;"Definitely happens. There's like shady gallerists, right?"
22:54;22:59;"Yeah, there's definitely shady gallerists who knowingly are selling counterfeits"
22:59;23:06;"I don't know about like the curator. I don't like the museums aren't really buying and or like they're buying work"
23:06;23:11;"But they're not really selling it. So but yes, they're definitely like shady art dealers"
23:11;23:15;"There was a really notorious case a few years ago"
23:15;23:20;"I think it's called like the Nadler Gallery and it's been around since like the 19th century in New York"
23:20;23:31;"Well, it's been a little fuzzy out of anyone. So one of the dealers who worked there was sell knowingly selling counterfeit counterfeit of like mid-century ABEX stuff"
23:31;23:39;"Well, which would be pretty easy to fake. Yeah, like a Rothko or something. Yeah, mother. Well something I forget the details"
23:39;23:44;"Anyway, yeah, they went to jail. I can picture in you know, 30 years the Vanity Fair article"
23:44;23:53;"It's talking about like Jay Feldman jr. Famous Michigan based multi-billionaire in the living room of his palatial mansion"
23:53;23:59;"Hangs a 10 by 10 Jake Longstreth painting of a Wendy's"
23:59;24:04;"It's a major conversation piece for him and one of the the prides of his collection"
24:04;24:06;"There's only one problem"
24:06;24:08;"Jake Longstreth never painted Wendy's"
24:08;24:16;"It is based off a photograph that Longstreth had posted on Instagram in 2029"
24:16;24:24;"Yeah, it was he had an art professor over for dinner once who was going on and on about the guy said, um, excuse me"
24:24;24:29;"I hate to be an ungracious guest but a long stress never painted Wendy's"
24:29;24:35;"Sure he did Taco Bell Mickey D's Wendy's jerk right about the first two not Wendy's"
24:35;24:40;"Yeah, I guess this kind of stuff happens all the time. But yeah, there's something particularly sad about at the rock and roll Hall of Fame because it's like"
24:40;24:46;"Outside the fine art world, which is so kind of like upper crust and pretentious"
24:46;24:51;"There's something about working at the rock and roll Hall of Fame. That's like we're gonna like the baseball Hall of Fame"
24:51;24:58;"It's just like yeah, just like a dream job pop your type of person. Yeah, it's just like a dream job for like just like a regular"
24:58;25:08;"Passionate person. I'm not saying that these guys weren't passionate, but it's just like damn as a real at Coen Brothers movie kind of feel to it"
25:08;25:17;"Yeah curator at the rock trying to pawn off these Don Henley handwritten lyrics. It's just I mean look maybe there's more to the story"
25:17;25:22;"Well, apparently they had been stolen in the 70s and they've been missing for like 40 years and again"
25:22;25:26;"I don't know how you often like determine the authenticity of this stuff"
25:26;25:29;"Well, this has always been a big question when you hear these stories about"
25:29;25:35;"Extremely rich people who are kind of illegally buying stuff like there was a guy"
25:35;25:45;"You know some New York finance billionaire and it turned out that he was illegally buying all sorts of like Middle Eastern antiquities"
25:45;25:48;"Wow, there was just always something that I would seem so weird to me"
25:48;25:52;"I guess when you people have way too much money that they need to find weird hobbies"
25:52;26:02;"But I was just picturing this guy just covertly gathering these things and then just like having them in a weird room in a weird warehouse somewhere"
26:02;26:07;"And he got in trouble and I think he's not allowed to I think he got off pretty easy"
26:07;26:11;"I think he had to pay some money and the judge said you can never buy antiquities again. He was like, all right"
26:11;26:16;"All right. I learned my lesson. We're just picturing these I guess it really is just bragging rights"
26:16;26:24;"Maybe it really is as simple as if you have billions and billions of dollars the idea that you could quietly"
26:24;26:29;"And maybe even you enjoy the covert aspect of it obtain. Oh for sure and"
26:29;26:34;"3,000 year old statue Don Henley's written lyrics for Hotel California"
26:34;26:39;"Maybe that alone just gives you a thrill and then sometimes you're having a you know"
26:39;26:44;"Dinner party and just like invite Warren Buffett you want like you want to see something cool like the Eagles?"
26:44;26:50;"Yeah, they're all right. You know the song Hotel California. Sure. Sure. Whoa, how'd you get that?"
26:50;26:56;"I can't tell you and don't tell anybody that I have this. All right, you signed an NDA to come to this dinner party"
26:56;27:04;"So I will sue you. Oh man, so these are just missing they found them. Yeah, maybe I wonder what the story is"
27:04;27:09;"So maybe it's not as dark as just like these dudes like taking stuff off the wall"
27:09;27:15;"Maybe they just found it and they realized they realized that had been missing for 40 years and they said oh shit"
27:15;27:21;"I guess we should probably announce that we found this and do a whole exhibition about it. Somebody said well, hold on"
27:21;27:25;"Everybody thinks it's gone. Maybe we should just find somebody to buy it"
27:25;27:29;"And there was a quote from Henley Henley was psyched that they had been recovered"
27:29;27:36;"Some like a journalist like jacked his like, you know spiral ring notebook in like 1975 or whatever"
27:36;27:41;"With the lyrics in it and they've been missing for like 40 something years"
27:41;27:50;"And Henley was like really, you know, just from this little like quote from his publicist seemed really psyched that had been recovered"
27:50;27:56;"So is it gonna go back to Henley? I think so. Wow. Henley's gonna immediately turn around and sell it"
27:56;28:06;"For 10 million dollars. I feel like wasn't there like a big Eminem had a laptop stolen or Kanye"
28:06;28:10;"There's some rapper who like major rapper had a laptop stolen famously"
28:10;28:17;"I wonder if that'll ever turn up and then somebody will have to like go through it and we'll find all sorts of like unreleased material one day"
28:17;28:23;"It's even funnier to think that whoever stole that laptop like didn't realize that it was Kanye's"
28:23;28:29;"Right. They just immediately wiped it and just sold it for 50 bucks. Yeah, wasn't it his cousin?"
28:29;28:36;"Yes. Oh his cousin stole it? Yeah, his cousin stole it and tried to yeah, that's not very cousinly"
28:36;28:44;"Not at all. By the way, these guys that stole the lyrics tried to sell it to Henley"
28:44;28:49;"Oh, that's that's super Coen brothers. That's just like bonehead"
28:49;28:56;"Prosecutors say that between 2012 and 2017 the defendants tried to get Henley to buy back the stolen manuscripts"
28:56;29:00;"While at the same time seeking to peddle them to other buyers like Christie's and Sotheby's"
29:00;29:04;"But like what were like the channels like how did they reach out to Don Henley?"
29:04;29:08;"They like reached out to Henley's lawyer and they were just like hey slid in his DMs"
29:08;29:14;"Now if it was a Coen brothers movie, it'd be like they'd like fly to LA go to his house like ring the doorbell"
29:14;29:19;"Then they're like sitting there with him like thinking that they have leverage and then just out of nowhere"
29:19;29:26;"Henley just like punches him in the face like Jesus Christ. It's like give me the lyrics"
29:26;29:33;"Henley of all people if you know anything about Henley, he's famously litigious, angry"
29:33;29:41;"No nonsense. No nonsense. He scared Frank Ocean so much about his song that was kind of written over Hotel California"
29:41;29:46;"That even when he'd play it live the band wouldn't do like the Hotel California changes"
29:46;29:50;"I'm sure he probably threatened him with some like vicious lawsuit"
29:50;29:53;"But Don you're gonna get those live royalties dude"
29:53;29:56;"Shut it down. Shut it down"
29:56;30:05;"Yeah, so Don like of all people the idea that the famously cantankerous Don Henley would get some weird email"
30:05;30:11;"Mr. Henley we have your notebook wire 1 million dollars in aetherium"
30:11;30:16;"Burn after reading slash Lebowski"
30:16;30:18;"Yeah totally"
30:18;30:19;"No Henley"
30:19;30:25;"He gets there they have the moment and yeah he just beats the shit out of them"
30:25;30:30;"He takes the notebook and kicks them out and now they have to like break back in"
30:30;30:33;"You know cause they owe money to someone else"
30:33;30:35;"They have to steal it back from Henley"
30:35;30:41;"Henley would probably fly to Cleveland just to slap that guy in the face"
30:41;30:46;"Picture just Don Henley just like going through security and the security guards are like"
30:46;30:50;"Uh Mr. Henley I'm sorry but you do need to buy a ticket just like alarms are going off"
30:50;30:52;"He's like shut the f*** up"
30:52;30:56;"Bust into the dudes office just like backhand slapping him in the face"
30:56;30:59;"Give me the f*** notebook"
30:59;31:04;"In the movie version it's Liam Neeson playing Don Henley"
31:04;31:07;"It's like a weird combination of their personas"
31:07;31:12;"I love that Don Henley has one crazy week in Cleveland"
31:12;31:15;"Man I haven't been in this town in years"
31:15;31:20;"Yeah he like rolls back to some like dive bar he hit in 75"
31:20;31:28;"Checks in on some old Ohio friends and then just like sadistically stalks the men who stole his notebook"
31:28;31:34;"Just one by one destroying their lives"
31:35;31:39;"Woke up with a heavy head and I thought about leaving town"
31:39;31:44;"I could have died if I wanted to, slipped over the edge and drowned"
31:44;31:51;"But oh no baby, I won't give up that easy mode"
31:51;31:57;"Too many time traps in the sands of time"
31:57;32:01;"Too many love affairs that stop on a dime"
32:01;32:09;"Well oh baby, I think it's time to make some change now"
32:09;32:13;"Yeah I'm gonna carry it out"
32:13;32:15;"I'm gonna crash it out"
32:15;32:17;"I'm gonna round it up"
32:17;32:20;"I'm gonna shake it up"
32:20;32:22;"All day"
32:22;32:26;"I will not love die"
32:26;32:30;"Well I guess there's some job openings at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"
32:30;32:35;"I'm sure we have some Ohio based TC listeners who fricking love rock and roll"
32:35;32:37;"Shoot your shot"
32:37;32:38;"Get that curator job"
32:38;32:40;"Or if you're willing to move"
32:40;32:43;"That'd be cool if you were like a real rock head but you were like"
32:43;32:47;"I was the chief curator at the Philadelphia Museum of Art for the last 20 years and you're like"
32:47;32:51;"Eh, let's look at this I'm looking to mix it up maybe move back home to Ohio"
32:51;32:53;"Absolutely"
32:53;32:58;"Just applying to the chief curator position at the Rock Hall"
32:58;33:01;"Yeah I wonder how often that job like turns over"
33:01;33:02;"Not often"
33:02;33:08;"If you're a rock and roll fan with a particular penchant for physical memorabilia"
33:08;33:13;"There's only a handful of jobs like high status jobs in the world for you"
33:13;33:15;"You gotta live in Cleveland or Tulsa"
33:15;33:19;"Isn't there something in Seattle? The Experience Music Project?"
33:19;33:20;"Sounds familiar"
33:20;33:23;"We're talking like 25 jobs in the world tops"
33:23;33:27;"I mean of course you could be like a you know like an independent dealer"
33:27;33:33;"But in terms of you know if you want that kind of status of being part of a well known institution"
33:33;33:36;"Where you can host scholars and musicians"
33:36;33:38;"There's about 25 jobs in the world"
33:38;33:42;"Probably of which 4 are like at the top"
33:42;33:46;"And one of them would be chief curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"
33:46;33:49;"And there just might be a job opening so"
33:49;33:52;"The pay is $28,000 a year"
33:52;33:54;"Yeah imagine you found out like the pay was such dog s***"
33:54;33:57;"You're just like oh man let him sell"
33:57;33:58;"Yeah"
33:58;34:03;"Well if honestly if this story had broken the week before I was in Cleveland"
34:03;34:07;"I think I would have head over there just to do a scene report"
34:07;34:09;"Yeah I bet"
34:09;34:11;"Times are tough over at the Hall"
34:11;34:17;"I would have done just used my phone to record some like live interviews"
34:17;34:19;"Just man on the street interviews just going up to people in the Hall"
34:19;34:22;"Just be like hey you hear about this Hotel California thing?"
34:22;34:23;"No"
34:23;34:24;"Oh man"
34:24;34:28;"The front office of the Rock Hall is really going nuts"
34:28;34:29;"In turmoil"
34:29;34:32;"Yeah I feel like there's so few things that are"
34:32;34:36;"It's I mean I guess that's the billionaires dilemma"
34:36;34:40;"Is that you just gotta keep upping the stakes for like less reward"
34:40;34:43;"And there's something about that to spend more and more money"
34:43;34:44;"Just to elicit"
34:44;34:47;"Like at best you're gonna have somebody go no s*** wow"
34:47;34:49;"Alright"
34:49;34:52;"Like spending so much money"
34:52;34:54;"And I guess maybe I'm being uncharitable"
34:54;34:57;"Because there maybe are some people who would like"
34:57;35:00;"Gollum style like hold their precious in their hands"
35:00;35:02;"And like feel something"
35:02;35:06;"I could see this is maybe sounds darker than it really is"
35:06;35:10;"But I could see like owning some kind of like famous skull"
35:10;35:12;"As something just like so insane"
35:12;35:14;"I think I told you guys this story about"
35:14;35:17;"Being at some sort of like weird secret society"
35:17;35:19;"At college once and some thing"
35:19;35:22;"Handed a semi famous person's skull over"
35:22;35:23;"At least they said it was"
35:23;35:25;"And just like holding it like damn that's weird"
35:25;35:29;"This is like Conor Roy and Napoleon's penis"
35:29;35:31;"Wasn't that one of the storylines in succession?"
35:31;35:32;"Was he trying to buy it?"
35:32;35:33;"I believe so"
35:33;35:36;"It also could have just been some bulls*** too"
35:36;35:38;"Might have just been Joe Schmoe's skull"
35:38;35:39;"And they just"
35:39;35:40;"Actually that's a pretty good thing"
35:40;35:42;"That's a cheap way to get that little kick"
35:42;35:45;"Is you just buy Joe Schmoe's skull"
35:45;35:47;"There's that store I don't know if they sell human skulls"
35:47;35:50;"There's that store in New York that always sells bones"
35:50;35:52;"In the village"
35:52;35:55;"And yeah that'd be something to just like"
35:55;35:57;"Have people over for drinks and some point"
35:57;35:58;"Everybody's getting a little tipsy"
35:58;35:59;"Be like you guys want to see something cool?"
35:59;36:00;"Open it"
36:00;36:02;"This is a real human skull"
36:02;36:03;"Everybody's holding it"
36:03;36:05;"Cause even there is something about holding a human skull"
36:05;36:07;"That's pretty wild"
36:07;36:09;"Cause you just have never done it before"
36:09;36:11;"You know you feel it's like Macbeth"
36:11;36:13;"And it really is this like whoa"
36:13;36:15;"This is the same thing in my head"
36:15;36:18;"Different than holding Don Henley's notebook"
36:18;36:21;"There's something primal, archetypal about it"
36:21;36:23;"You're holding like death in your hand"
36:23;36:26;"Or you're holding like the eternal human form"
36:26;36:27;"I don't know"
36:27;36:28;"I haven't thought it through enough"
36:28;36:30;"But there's something just like intense about it"
36:30;36:32;"And then if on top of that like"
36:32;36:33;"You just said to somebody like"
36:33;36:37;"I don't even know who people I know would be like impressed by"
36:37;36:39;"This is Jerry Garcia's skull"
36:39;36:41;"Yeah I guess so"
36:41;36:42;"Also like the Grateful Dead"
36:42;36:46;"There's so many weirdo like old ass billionaire deadheads"
36:46;36:50;"And there's such like an insane psychotic like"
36:50;36:54;"Obsession with ephemera and memorabilia with the dead"
36:54;36:55;"And also like the skull"
36:55;36:57;"Jerry Garcia's skull would be the full"
36:57;36:59;"That would be the apex"
36:59;37:01;"And the dead famously use skulls as part of their imagery"
37:01;37:03;"So there could be"
37:03;37:05;"See I think that's where it gets really interesting"
37:05;37:08;"That's where we're talking about tens of millions of dollars"
37:08;37:11;"And truly insane weird sh*t"
37:11;37:15;"I think there probably is some crazy billionaire deadhead"
37:15;37:20;"Who already has Jerry, Pigpen, Brent's skulls"
37:20;37:22;"Well I was gonna say"
37:22;37:24;"This one guy is like yeah has Jerry's skull"
37:24;37:26;"And then his buddy"
37:26;37:28;"The Jerry's skull was a little too rich for his blood"
37:28;37:30;"So he has Keith Godchild's skull"
37:30;37:34;"Oh god"
37:34;37:36;"He got that for 750 grand"
37:39;37:41;"The rest of the guys have pre-negotiated"
37:41;37:43;"You had various other billionaires"
37:43;37:45;"Oh man"
37:47;37:49;"Pre-negotiated"
37:49;37:53;"You know what like okay when I die"
37:53;37:55;"Like that's fine you can like dismember me"
37:55;37:57;"Chop my head off"
37:57;38:00;"And you can keep my skull"
38:00;38:02;"But you have to be sold"
38:02;38:04;"At auction"
38:04;38:06;"Yeah well no like the proceeds have to go to charity"
38:07;38:09;"Yeah like on the back of your driver's license"
38:09;38:11;"It says if I die"
38:11;38:13;"I'm willing to donate my eyes"
38:13;38:15;"My liver, my lungs"
38:15;38:17;"There's also like a little part that says"
38:17;38:19;"However my skull"
38:19;38:21;"Has been pre-negotiated"
38:21;38:23;"To go to Mark Cuban"
38:23;38:25;"At a agreed upon price"
38:25;38:27;"Of 2.5 million dollars"
38:27;38:29;"Make sure that gets to Mark Cuban"
38:29;38:31;"Tops go high and hells descend"
38:31;38:33;"When bodies with no surprise"
38:33;38:35;"Turn the bloodstains down like devil's brains"
38:35;38:37;"You don't care tonight"
38:37;38:41;"I want your skull"
38:41;38:46;"I need your skull"
38:46;38:50;"I want your skull"
38:50;38:54;"I need your skull"
38:54;38:57;"I wonder if this exists"
38:57;39:00;"I mean obviously in many cases"
39:00;39:02;"Ugh this is getting pretty dark"
39:02;39:04;"But like you know grave robbing is 100% a thing"
39:04;39:07;"Because you can imagine a lot of families"
39:07;39:09;"Oh god this is so dark"
39:09;39:11;"Just imagine that like someone died"
39:11;39:13;"And the family's grieving"
39:13;39:15;"And they're having to go through all the horrible things"
39:15;39:18;"Dealing with the burial"
39:18;39:20;"And it's so sad"
39:20;39:22;"And everybody's in shock"
39:22;39:24;"And then just like some weird dude in a suit rolls up"
39:24;39:26;"And is just like"
39:26;39:28;"I'm so sorry for your loss"

40:05;40:08;"Scientists found more than 450 human skulls"
40:08;40:10;"For sale on eBay"
40:10;40:12;"Now these are mainly for"
40:12;40:13;"What's the legality of that?"

40:25;40:26;"They deduced"
40:26;40:29;"Oh so eBay's now banned this"
40:29;40:31;"But this was for"
40:31;40:35;"Mainly for forensic and archaeological purposes"

40:50;40:51;"It's like 1am"
40:51;40:53;"And there are two ways this could go"
40:53;40:54;"I feel like one is like"
40:54;40:56;"Jay Feldman makes the offer"
40:56;40:59;"Or B) Mark has just had one of the best nights of his life"
40:59;41:01;"And he's just like you know what"

51:46;51:48;"for Sizzler, I was like, yep, I'll watch this"
51:48;51:50;"Clearly it exceeded your expectations"
51:50;51:52;"Oh my god"
51:52;51:54;"It's quite the commercial"
51:54;51:56;"It's an advertisement, it's a little unclear what it is"
51:56;51:58;"Although, I haven't really"
51:58;52:00;"Okay, looks like Matt did some research"
52:00;52:02;"Yeah, we found out a bit"
52:02;52:04;"Yeah, because it's so long"
52:04;52:06;"And there's something about the tone of it"
52:06;52:08;"where it's not just selling you on"
52:08;52:10;"like, come down to Sizzler, you'll have a good time"
52:10;52:12;"It's selling you on the whole concept of Sizzler"
52:12;52:14;"It turns out it was used at their annual meeting"
52:14;52:16;"Probably playing it for potential"
52:16;52:18;"franchisees"
52:18;52:20;"Really trying to be like, guys"
52:20;52:22;"Right, get in on Sizzler"
52:22;52:24;"Invest in Sizzler. Should we just like, listen to it?"
52:24;52:26;"Yeah"
52:26;52:28;"You can kind of describe it"
52:32;52:34;"Amazing"
52:34;52:36;"All across"
52:36;52:38;"America"
52:38;52:40;"The song of freedom rings"
52:40;52:42;"The song"
52:42;52:44;"is growing stronger"
52:44;52:46;"every day"
52:46;52:48;"Can you imagine what images of America"
52:48;52:50;"tells us when we listen"
52:50;52:52;"to the message"
52:52;52:54;"that it sings"
52:54;52:56;"Let us lift our voices"
52:56;52:58;"We can make the choices"
52:58;53:00;"We will make the most of all the best"
53:00;53:02;"that freedom brings"
53:02;53:04;"Sizzler is the one"
53:04;53:06;"who brings us choices"
53:06;53:08;"Reaching out across"
53:08;53:10;"the USA"
53:10;53:12;"Reaching out across"
53:12;53:14;"the USA"
53:14;53:16;"Reaching out across"
53:16;53:18;"the USA"
53:18;53:20;"USA"
53:22;53:24;"Each and every day"
53:24;53:26;"Ooh, yeah"
53:26;53:28;"Get a little freedom"
53:28;53:30;"in your"
53:30;53:32;"This is a good song"
53:32;53:34;"It almost reminds me of like"
53:34;53:36;"80s Peter Cetera"
53:36;53:38;"Oh yeah, totally"
53:38;53:40;"Maybe David Foster worked on this"
53:40;53:42;"All over America, a quiet revolution"
53:42;53:44;"has been taking place"
53:44;53:46;"Oh?"
53:46;53:48;"Both parents are working"
53:48;53:50;"and raising families"
53:50;53:52;"Life seems to be moving faster"
53:52;53:54;"than ever"
53:54;53:56;"And Americans have rediscovered"
53:56;53:58;"or redefining what's really important"
53:58;54:00;"in their lives"
54:00;54:02;"They want quality"
54:02;54:04;"in their personal life, in their business life"
54:04;54:06;"in the goods they purchase"
54:06;54:08;"and in the food they eat"
54:08;54:10;"They want good, basic home cooking"
54:10;54:12;"quality food"
54:12;54:14;"and they want choices, variety"
54:14;54:16;"all at a reasonable price"
54:16;54:18;"Americans want value"
54:18;54:20;"Sizzler brings the choices"
54:22;54:24;"that you've been looking for"
54:24;54:26;"and giving you"
54:26;54:28;"the right to choose"
54:28;54:30;"we're offering much more"
54:30;54:32;"the right to choose"
54:32;54:34;"by holding to traditions"
54:34;54:36;"yet changing"
54:36;54:38;"with the times"
54:38;54:40;"choices and selections"
54:44;54:46;"choices that can add"
54:46;54:48;"a little freedom"
54:48;54:50;"in your life"
54:50;54:52;"freedom"
54:52;54:54;"Sizzler is the choice"
54:54;54:56;"of America"
54:56;54:58;"Sizzler gives you choices"
54:58;55:00;"every day"
55:00;55:02;"that's the Sizzler way"
55:02;55:04;"get a little freedom"
55:04;55:06;"freedom"
55:14;55:16;"that part is so Peter Santera"
55:16;55:18;"yeah"
55:18;55:20;"wholesome"
55:20;55:22;"American cooking"
55:22;55:24;"fresh fish, a variety of salads"
55:24;55:26;"wonderful hot appetizers"
55:26;55:28;"tantalizing combination platters"
55:28;55:30;"all backed with a new kind"
55:30;55:32;"of courteous, friendly service"
55:32;55:34;"Sizzler"
55:34;55:36;"introduces a new kind of dining"
55:36;55:38;"with two completely different"
55:38;55:40;"dining experiences in one restaurant"
55:40;55:42;"the grill"
55:42;55:44;"with a variety of distinctive platters"
55:44;55:46;"and the buffet"
55:46;55:48;"court, a whole experience"
55:48;55:50;"on its own, where you create"
55:50;55:52;"delicious combinations just"
55:52;55:54;"the way you want"
55:54;55:56;"it's a restaurant within a restaurant"
55:56;55:58;"with all the value, quality"
55:58;56:00;"and freedom of choice Americans want"
56:00;56:02;"it's unique"
56:02;56:04;"it's bold, it's ahead"
56:04;56:06;"of the competition"
56:06;56:08;"Sizzler for the 90's"
56:08;56:10;"exactly what America"
56:10;56:12;"Sizzler for the 90's"
56:12;56:14;"Sizzler is the choice"
56:14;56:16;"of America"
56:16;56:18;"that's the climax of the ad copy"
56:18;56:20;"Sizzler for the 90's"
56:20;56:22;"every day"
56:22;56:24;"that's the Sizzler way"
56:26;56:28;"get a little freedom"
56:28;56:30;"freedom"
56:34;56:36;"Sizzler"
56:36;56:38;"freedom"
56:38;56:40;"is yours"
56:40;56:42;"Sizzler"
56:42;56:44;"freedom"
56:48;56:50;"honestly, could David Foster"
56:50;56:52;"write that?"
56:52;56:54;"Sizzler"
56:54;56:56;"and that's real"
56:56;56:58;"the whisper at the end"
56:58;57:00;"I know, that probably sounds like one of us did that"
57:00;57:02;"but out of nowhere it goes, Sizzler"
57:02;57:04;"really spooky"
57:04;57:06;"it's like a horror movie called The Sizzler"
57:06;57:08;"Sizzler"
57:08;57:10;"it's so"
57:10;57:12;"I can't believe it's real"
57:12;57:14;"and you honestly don't have to see the images"
57:14;57:16;"even just hearing it"
57:16;57:18;"I had the same crazy mix of emotions"
57:18;57:20;"it's a genuinely moving song"
57:20;57:22;"it's sophisticated writing"
57:22;57:24;"truly after the first chorus"
57:24;57:26;"I was like, I want to hear that again"
57:26;57:28;"Sizzler is the choice"
57:28;57:30;"of America"
57:30;57:32;"America"
57:32;57:34;"how long is that song? Was it five minutes?"
57:34;57:36;"pushing it"
57:36;57:38;"it's like a full song"
57:38;57:40;"and I know we talk so much on the show about things being"
57:40;57:42;"kind of dystopian or buff"
57:42;57:44;"but this just really takes the cake"
57:44;57:46;"I wonder if whoever they hired"
57:46;57:48;"to make this maybe had"
57:48;57:50;"come from politics"
57:50;57:52;"because this totally seems like a Reagan ad"
57:52;57:54;"it's a relic from the end of the Cold War"
57:54;57:56;"I mean you don't think of"
57:56;57:58;"the 90s as like"
57:58;58:00;"you think of the 90s as not the Cold War"
58:00;58:02;"the Cold War ended in '89"
58:02;58:04;"and '91"
58:04;58:06;"when the USSR dissolved"
58:06;58:08;"but it felt like it's from like, yeah, 1981"
58:08;58:10;"well Lee Greenwood's"
58:10;58:12;"God Bless the USA"
58:12;58:14;"which this song sounds a lot like"
58:14;58:16;"to me came out in '84"
58:16;58:18;"when I guess we should add"
58:18;58:20;"some context here, we have a quote"
58:20;58:22;"from a Washington Post article from"
58:22;58:24;"2015. There was an article"
58:24;58:26;"on this? Yeah, I don't know exactly what the article"
58:26;58:28;"was about but a senior director at industry research"
58:28;58:30;"firm Technomic"
58:30;58:32;"Marcy Chapman said, ""Sizzler"
58:32;58:34;"had kind of come and gone and was trying"
58:34;58:36;"to rebound and gain relevance"
58:36;58:38;"because Sizzler was actually found in 1958"
58:38;58:40;"as the Sizzler Family"
58:40;58:42;"Steakhouse by Dell and Helen Johnson"
58:42;58:44;"in Culver City, California."" Ayo!"
58:44;58:46;"I feel like Sizzler really hit its peak"
58:46;58:48;"in like the 70s and 80s"
58:50;58:52;"this was kind of like their bid"
58:52;58:54;"to find an angle"
58:54;58:56;"for why"
58:56;58:58;"even though times were changing"
58:58;59:00;"Sizzler was that perfect mix"
59:00;59:02;"of tradition"
59:02;59:04;"and new ideas"
59:04;59:06;"and you know, clearly"
59:06;59:08;"they must have sat down with some research"
59:08;59:10;"firm who said, ""You don't feel like the next"
59:10;59:12;"decade, you feel like the last decade"
59:12;59:14;"at best."" Sizzler is"
59:14;59:16;"kind of stale, the modern"
59:16;59:18;"family, they're not excited"
59:18;59:20;"to go out and have this communal"
59:20;59:22;"experience at the buffet,"
59:22;59:24;"the social ties are breaking"
59:24;59:26;"down, America's descending into"
59:26;59:28;"chaos, like Sizzler seems"
59:28;59:30;"quaint. You know, the 90s, chaos."
59:30;59:32;"This is the 90s."
59:32;59:34;"It's gonna be chaotic. The 90s"
59:34;59:36;"were chaotic in a way."
59:36;59:38;"I mean, at least like... I think they're the most placid"
59:38;59:40;"decade of this"
59:40;59:42;"country's history probably, but"
59:42;59:44;"they didn't know that in '91."
59:44;59:46;"I also just think that like in '91, you're getting"
59:46;59:48;"the rise of chilies and apple bees"
59:48;59:50;"which is sort of like, ""Look, you're a family"
59:50;59:52;"you want to go out to dinner, you don't want to go to"
59:52;59:54;"a steakhouse. Limited options."""
59:54;59:56;"And that's why Sizzler's freaking out about"
59:56;59:58;"the ""freedom"" that you get"
59:58;01:00:00;"if you go to"
01:00:00;01:00:02;"Sizzler. I think most suburban"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"families were like, ""Let's go to Applebee's and get"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"mom can get her fajitas."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"If dad wants a steak, he can get it."
01:00:08;01:00:10;"And the kids can get nachos."""
01:00:10;01:00:12;"And Sizzler, yeah, it seemed like it was"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"like, you picture like a pathetic"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"salad bar and like kind of a mediocre"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"steak. And maybe a baked potato."
01:00:18;01:00:20;"And they were, yes,"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"and baked potatoes. So they were"
01:00:22;01:00:24;"adding table service"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"so that it would feel"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"like you had this choice"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"between hitting the buffet or just"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"sitting down and having like the"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"chilies and screams. I think they were adding the buffet."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"I think they were adding the buffet. I think the table service"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"was kind of weird. Originally, but I think they had already added the buffet"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"in the '80s. So I feel like at the peak"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"of Sizzler, it was a buffet."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"Never been. I think I went to"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"a Sizzler with my grandma probably around"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"'91. I mean, there's still around, I think."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"Yeah, there's somewhere."
01:00:50;01:00:52;"I mean, you know, of course"
01:00:52;01:00:54;"at this point, it's owned by a private equity"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"firm. In 2005, it was sold to"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"Pacific Equity Partners, an"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"Australian-based investment firm."
01:01:00;01:01:02;"In 2020, Sizzler"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to"
01:01:04;01:01:06;"COVID-19, hurting sales."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"There's 107 locations."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"There's a lot."
01:01:12;01:01:14;"Mama said he's outside, fuckin' where yours at?"
01:01:14;01:01:17;"Top down on the good day, Decatur out on Woodway"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"Got casting and shit I stay, what the hood say?"
01:01:19;01:01:22;"thinking they wanna rob me now, they wanna stop me now"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"Dwarf, didn't holla last year, feel sorry now"
01:01:24;01:01:27;"Practice jump shots, Reggie mill, Robert Ari now"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"The n***a that you wit, play like Atari now"
01:01:29;01:01:32;"Lyrically unorthodox, I flow continuous"
01:01:32;01:01:35;"Never on a straight path, I'm known to bend and twist"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"Put it down from the suburbs to the tenement"
01:01:37;01:01:40;"You bettin' against me, but wanna wonder where your money went?"
01:01:40;01:01:42;"I get the cash, take a look and thought like trash"
01:01:42;01:01:45;"Don't a stack of mean stats, they used to call me pure math"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"Back in the days, all I did was stay paper"
01:01:47;01:01:50;"As they say in the South, ""Gimme some DM"""
01:01:50;01:01:52;"Excuse me, mister, do she got a sister?"
01:01:52;01:01:55;"Blue he not to kiss her, true she do, got a blister"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"Not a movie plot, twist like a Twizzler"
01:01:57;01:02:00;"If I needed my meat burnt, I'd go to Sizzler"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"Getting paid like a biker with the best crank"
01:02:02;01:02:05;"Sprayed like a high-ranked sniper in the West Bank"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"Type to just blank and don't show much pity"
01:02:07;01:02:10;"When I'm in the city, I always keep a Dutch with me"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"Touch a dish, 'til she ask me where the trees at"
01:02:12;01:02:15;"Her tummy don't squeeze that, rats wanna tease a cat"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"Let the dog beg, wait up, who talkin'?"
01:02:17;01:02:20;"Doom with the hog legs, straight up, New Yorkin'"
01:02:20;01:02:23;"Maybe Sizzler wasn't particularly changing much about the restaurant"
01:02:23;01:02:26;"They were making this kind of last-ditch effort to"
01:02:26;01:02:29;"Brand themselves as the future"
01:02:29;01:02:32;"Maybe people were finding buffets passé"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"I'm not sure why"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"Maybe it just seemed classier just to"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"Not have a buffet to sit down"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"And Sizzler had to say like, ""No, no, no"
01:02:40;01:02:44;"The buffet is about choice, it's about freedom"""
01:02:44;01:02:46;"Or at least clearly some market researcher said"
01:02:46;01:02:48;"""That's how you save this"""
01:02:48;01:02:51;"It's not a buffet like you're in high school or at a nursing home"
01:02:51;01:02:53;"No, no, no, this is about freedom"
01:02:53;01:02:56;"And truly, the part that sticks out the most to me"
01:02:56;01:03:01;"And why this Sizzler in-house promotional video"
01:03:01;01:03:06;"Has such kind of like, 1984 slavery is freedom type energy"
01:03:06;01:03:09;"Is this thing about like, times are changing"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"You've got more parents in more households"
01:03:11;01:03:12;"You've got both parents going to work"
01:03:12;01:03:16;"I love that, they get like, social analysis"
01:03:16;01:03:18;"Which I'm sure at the time was a topic"
01:03:18;01:03:20;"If you were probably sitting in that room"
01:03:20;01:03:21;"You're probably like, ""Oh yeah"
01:03:21;01:03:24;"Yep, both parents in my household work"
01:03:24;01:03:25;"Less stay-at-home parents"""
01:03:25;01:03:28;"But there's just something about that where you're"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"Just kind of like, talking about that"
01:03:30;01:03:33;"As if it's just like, this inevitable thing"
01:03:33;01:03:35;"Where yeah, more people have to go to work"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"Can't spend as much time with the kids"
01:03:37;01:03:40;"People don't trust each other as much as they used to"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"A lot of kids sitting around, not being with their parents"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"But you know what?"
01:03:44;01:03:45;"You can come to Sizzler"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"They're basically trying to say"
01:03:47;01:03:49;"Even positive aspects of tradition"
01:03:49;01:03:52;"Like a family sitting down at dinner together like"
01:03:52;01:03:53;"You can't make that happen"
01:03:53;01:03:55;"What are you living in the 50s?"
01:03:55;01:03:57;"It's over, economic necessity"
01:03:57;01:03:59;"Is forcing everybody at the house"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"Nobody has time to prepare a dinner"
01:04:01;01:04:02;"At best"
01:04:02;01:04:05;"Mom can't put a pot roast in the oven at 3 in the afternoon"
01:04:05;01:04:06;"She's working"
01:04:06;01:04:09;"No, at best they can pick you up from the babysitter's house"
01:04:09;01:04:12;"And take you to Sizzler for a tight 45"
01:04:12;01:04:16;"And there, the meager choices that you have"
01:04:16;01:04:19;"Will give you the sense of freedom"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"It's just such a sad way"
01:04:21;01:04:22;"I mean, it might be real"
01:04:22;01:04:24;"But it's just such like, a sad marketing pitch"
01:04:24;01:04:29;"In the video, the word ""choice"" is said 12 times"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"And ""freedom"" is said 6 times"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"But that was an illusion"
01:04:33;01:04:35;"But that was an illusion"
01:04:35;01:04:39;"Freedom, choice, freedom, choice"
01:04:39;01:04:42;"If you're on the side of Sizzler, you're on the side of freedom"
01:04:42;01:04:43;"Simple as that"
01:04:43;01:04:47;"I would love to see the like, Todd Haynes movie"
01:04:47;01:04:51;"About the making of this infomercial"
01:04:51;01:04:55;"Yeah, truly, from the pitch all the way to the annual meeting"
01:04:55;01:04:57;"I mean, I'm also so curious"
01:04:57;01:05:02;"Was there somewhere, there was like a cold-hearted investor"
01:05:02;01:05:05;"Who was like, ""I don't know about Sizzler anymore"""
01:05:05;01:05:06;"""That feels 80s"""
01:05:06;01:05:07;"""It's 91"""
01:05:07;01:05:10;"""I'm betting big on Taco Bell, Subway"""
01:05:10;01:05:12;"""That feels fresh"""
01:05:12;01:05:13;"""Chilis"""
01:05:13;01:05:15;"And then they sat down and heard this song"
01:05:15;01:05:18;"And watched this video"
01:05:18;01:05:20;"And like, a tear rolled down their cheek"
01:05:20;01:05:21;"And they said, ""F*** it"""
01:05:21;01:05:23;"""I'm all in on Sizzler again"""
01:05:23;01:05:26;"And then 5 years later, Sizzler declared bankruptcy"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"I mean, they blew it"
01:05:27;01:05:28;"I mean, 90s?"
01:05:28;01:05:33;"I just feel like the casual dining industry was just like, exploding"
01:05:33;01:05:34;"Yeah, it's true"
01:05:34;01:05:38;"What is it about Sizzler that didn't work in the 90s?"
01:05:38;01:05:41;"I don't think steakhouses were cool in the 90s"
01:05:41;01:05:44;"I think it's this buffet"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"Because, you know, you can only..."
01:05:46;01:05:47;"Like, this is interesting"
01:05:47;01:05:50;"It says, ""In the 80s, Sizzler transformed their salad bar"""
01:05:50;01:05:52;"""Into a full buffet known as the buffet court"""
01:05:52;01:05:58;"""Customers, you know, basically urging customers to use the buffet as the full meal"""
01:05:58;01:06:00;"""Instead of just an add-on entree"""
01:06:00;01:06:05;"So you're basically trying to create a real paradigm shift"
01:06:05;01:06:06;"Like a cafeteria"
01:06:06;01:06:07;"Yeah, you really try..."
01:06:07;01:06:11;"You want to change the way people think about the buffet"
01:06:11;01:06:12;"That's a tall order, right?"
01:06:12;01:06:15;"Plus, dude, if you're eating steak"
01:06:15;01:06:17;"You want a waiter to come up to you"
01:06:17;01:06:20;"Ask you how the steak is going to be cooked"
01:06:20;01:06:22;"You want to get a beer, a glass of wine"
01:06:22;01:06:24;"You don't want to eat steak at a buffet"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"But I thought they had other food"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"I thought you would hit the Sizzler buffet court"
01:06:28;01:06:30;"You get yourself some salad"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"Some macaroni cheese"
01:06:32;01:06:33;"Some fried chicken"
01:06:33;01:06:35;"Maybe like a sandwich or something"
01:06:35;01:06:36;"You pile it high"
01:06:36;01:06:37;"Eat all that stuff"
01:06:37;01:06:38;"A little bit of steak"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"Maybe a pork chop"
01:06:40;01:06:40;"All this stuff"
01:06:40;01:06:44;"Then you come back and you're making yourself two, three big bowls of ice cream"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"Putting all the toppings on"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"I thought that's what Sizzler was all about"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"9,000 calories"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"Pizza Hut used to have a buffet option"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"Did they eventually get rid of that?"
01:06:54;01:06:54;"Yes"
01:06:54;01:06:55;"They got rid of it?"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"Well, I think they called it the salad"
01:06:57;01:06:58;"I just remember going..."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"I've been trying to find it"
01:07:00;01:07:03;"Because I remember it more of as a salad bar"
01:07:03;01:07:04;"But I think it had pizza"
01:07:04;01:07:05;"I think it had pizza too"
01:07:05;01:07:06;"I think you could..."
01:07:06;01:07:07;"It had pizza too"
01:07:07;01:07:08;"And there's still..."
01:07:08;01:07:09;"My impression is that there's still"
01:07:09;01:07:12;"Kind of like mom and pop Chinese buffets"
01:07:12;01:07:15;"All across this great nation"
01:07:15;01:07:16;"Yeah, I can see that more"
01:07:16;01:07:17;"For sure"
01:07:17;01:07:18;"I think there's still..."
01:07:19;01:07:23;"I know of Indian restaurants that still have the buffet lunch"
01:07:23;01:07:23;"Yeah"
01:07:23;01:07:23;"Mmm"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"Sizzler is..."
01:07:25;01:07:25;"It's funny when..."
01:07:25;01:07:29;"You know, I was in Las Vegas for that Morrissey show last week"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"And my brother was like..."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"Because I really have never been to Vegas"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"And my brother was like, ""Are you gonna hit up the buffet?"""
01:07:34;01:07:36;"Which also seems like a very..."
01:07:36;01:07:38;"Oh yeah, there's some really famous..."
01:07:38;01:07:38;"Weird..."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"In an era of COVID"
01:07:39;01:07:40;"Casino buffets"
01:07:40;01:07:41;"COVID"
01:07:41;01:07:42;"Seems odd"
01:07:42;01:07:46;"But he was like, ""No, no, the buffets in Vegas, they're different"""
01:07:46;01:07:48;"Like they're like really good"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"You know, like the King Crab Legs"
01:07:50;01:07:51;"They always have the King Crab Legs"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"Flown in every day from Alaska"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"Jesus Christ"
01:07:55;01:07:57;"So did you hit the buffet?"
01:07:57;01:07:58;"No, so I ended up not..."
01:07:58;01:08:00;"We ended up not doing the buffet"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"We were close"
01:08:02;01:08:06;"And then another option presented itself"
01:08:06;01:08:07;"But I think that..."
01:08:07;01:08:10;"Next time Morrissey does a residency and I go back"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"I will probably hit up the buffet"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"You gotta get the Alaskan King Crab Legs"
01:08:14;01:08:17;"Yeah, I mean that feels like the most buffet thing"
01:08:17;01:08:17;"But it is"
01:08:17;01:08:18;"It's like..."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"That's a staple"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"It's a Vegas staple"
01:08:21;01:08:23;"So I know that that's still a big deal"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"It's definitely a Vegas staple"

01:09:16;01:09:24;"there was some sense that the type of America as people once knew it was over, the family"
01:09:24;01:09:30;"structure was over, it was passe, and maybe a buffet just seemed too communal to people,"
01:09:30;01:09:35;"and it was just starting to represent something that people didn't vibe with anymore. I mean,"
01:09:35;01:09:40;"I know it sounds like such a small thing, but the difference between, you know, sitting down"
01:09:40;01:09:46;"at TGI Fridays with your crew at your table, eating, drinking, and leaving versus having to"

01:10:05;01:10:10;"live, and maybe buffets are just like too close for comfort. It's an America that maybe never even"
01:10:10;01:10:14;"existed, but if it ever did, it's certainly dead by '91. And Sizzler makes us last ditch effort to"
01:10:14;01:10:19;"go, ""No, no, no, the buffet, that's freedom of choice."" It's like nobody wants that, man. People"
01:10:19;01:10:24;"want to be in their own booth, in their own bubble. You want your personalized consumer experience."
01:10:24;01:10:30;"You want the experience to reflect your preferences. And the mistake of Sizzler was selling"
01:10:30;01:10:35;"it as that. And everyone just sees through the ruse. There should have been a mobile buffet"
01:10:35;01:10:42;"where kind of like a big, the waiter brings the buffet over to your pod, they remove the cover,"
01:10:42;01:10:47;"and you start grabbing all the mac and cheese and the different salads that you want,"
01:10:47;01:10:50;"but you get to stay in your booth. The Chinese have it figured out. It's called dim sum."
01:10:50;01:10:56;"That's basically a- Dim sum is the choice of America."
01:10:58;01:11:03;"I don't understand the economics of dim sum, but yeah, dim sum feels like a buffet at your"
01:11:03;01:11:08;"own table. I mean, this is the Chinese century. Yeah, I dig that."
01:11:08;01:11:11;"Okay, well, let's- I dig a sushi train."
01:11:11;01:11:11;"Yep."
01:11:11;01:11:13;"Which is like a buffet. It's a moving buffet."
01:11:13;01:11:19;"I bet an American dim sum restaurant where you bring over a little thing of potato salad,"
01:11:19;01:11:22;"small fried chicken, just keep bringing it over to the table."
01:11:22;01:11:25;"Just like room temperature fried chicken."
01:11:25;01:11:26;"No."
01:11:28;01:11:31;"Like it was fried like three hours ago. It's been on the cart."
01:11:31;01:11:36;"In 2011, Sizzler launched a food truck to revive the brand."
01:11:36;01:11:39;"That's so deep. That's so pathetic."
01:11:39;01:11:42;"Who are they serving on the food? Sizzler food truck."
01:11:42;01:11:46;"Dude, look, Sizzler's got a food truck on Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg."
01:11:46;01:11:50;"Right next to the endless summer taco truck."
01:11:50;01:11:57;"Sizzler is the choice of America. I mean, you could even make the case that if the buffet was"
01:11:57;01:12:03;"where you had to stand shoulder to shoulder with your fellow American, and that then people wanted"
01:12:03;01:12:10;"to retreat to their booths, and now people want a contactless delivery to their own home."
01:12:10;01:12:13;"I don't want to see the driver. I don't want to talk to a human."
01:12:13;01:12:17;"Leave it on the ground. Get the f*** out of here."
01:12:17;01:12:21;"Yeah, just leave it on the pavement outside my door."
01:12:21;01:12:25;"And I'm not saying that there aren't real reasons for this."
01:12:26;01:12:31;"Look at the political turmoil. Of course, look at people's rights being stripped away."
01:12:31;01:12:36;"Of course, these are tense times. No doubt about it. This is serious stuff. But like,"
01:12:36;01:12:41;"it is interesting to imagine that there's someone somewhere who was like a kid in the 80s,"
01:12:41;01:12:47;"was hitting their local Sizzler and spending time with their whole family."
01:12:47;01:12:50;"Now they're getting contactless delivery."
01:12:50;01:12:50;"Yeah."
01:12:50;01:12:55;"This is almost like, this seems like a joke to me. So when they launched the food truck,"
01:12:55;01:12:59;"the CEO at the time, Cary Cramp, had this to say."
01:12:59;01:13:00;"Cary Cramp?"
01:13:00;01:13:01;"This is Cary Cramp."
01:13:01;01:13:02;"That's Gary or Cary?"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"Cary. Cary Cramp."
01:13:04;01:13:10;"Great name. It's like some SNL s***. And here's our next guest on Weekend Update is Cary Cramp,"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"CEO of Sizzler."
01:13:12;01:13:17;"And this is full SNL. So this is a quote from Cary Cramp,"
01:13:17;01:13:22;"CEO of Sizzler at the launch of the food truck. And this actually makes me pretty sad."
01:13:23;01:13:27;"""It's a fun way to introduce people to Sizzler."" He says. Oh, it's a he."
01:13:27;01:13:30;"""If they think we're cool enough to do great food on a food truck,"
01:13:30;01:13:33;"they may think we're cool enough to check out our restaurants."""
01:13:33;01:13:35;"Cool enough."

01:14:05;01:14:09;"And it runs on Apple iPads."
01:14:09;01:14:12;"OK, you know what? We're hitting a Sizzler."
01:14:12;01:14:14;"Dude, there's one in Atwater."
01:14:14;01:14:18;"All right, let's hit it. Let's go next week. Crisis crew."
01:14:18;01:14:22;"OK, guys, guess how many followers the official Sizzler account?"
01:14:22;01:14:23;"Has on Twitter."
01:14:23;01:14:26;"11,000."
01:14:26;01:14:29;"I want to say 25,000."

01:14:31;01:14:32;"Just to make me feel better."
01:14:32;01:14:34;"No, it's 5,300."
01:14:34;01:14:41;"Oh, I got the not followed by anyone you're following text as well."
01:14:41;01:14:43;"Born 1958."
01:14:43;01:14:45;"You just find out followed by Hannah Fidel."
01:14:45;01:14:46;"Yeah, that'd be tight."
01:14:46;01:14:50;"I'm looking at one of their tweets."
01:14:50;01:14:53;"Their Mother's Day tweet from 2020."
01:14:53;01:14:56;"You can't take mom down to Malibu this Mother's Day,"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"but you can still deliver Malibu to her."
01:14:58;01:15:00;"Oh, because this is COVID era."
01:15:00;01:15:04;"Hit up your local Sizzler on DoorDash, UberEats, GrubHub, or Postmates"
01:15:04;01:15:07;"and send mom some yummy Malibu chicken made with love."
01:15:07;01:15:10;"Don't forget to include all her favorite sides."
01:15:10;01:15:12;"What is Malibu chicken?"
01:15:12;01:15:16;"Dude, Sizzler's Twitter account was going off in March 2020."
01:15:16;01:15:18;"They were just like curbside fools."
01:15:19;01:15:20;"Are you open?"
01:15:20;01:15:21;"Very active."
01:15:21;01:15:22;"We get that question a lot lately."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"The short answer is it's complicated."
01:15:24;01:15:27;"I guess at Sizzler you can get lobster tail."
01:15:27;01:15:28;"You get all sorts of fun stuff."
01:15:28;01:15:31;"I'm looking at a surf and turf plate."
01:15:31;01:15:34;"It's steak, lobster tail, and a baked potato."
01:15:34;01:15:36;"Semi loaded."
01:15:36;01:15:38;"All right, we're hitting Sizzler."
01:15:38;01:15:39;"I'm way down, dude."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"We're going to swing by the Bone Room."

01:15:49;01:15:50;"It's going to rule."
01:15:50;01:15:54;"All right, is it time for the top five?"
01:15:54;01:16:01;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:16:01;01:16:06;"This week we'll be counting down the top five Billboard hits of 2009"
01:16:06;01:16:09;"and comparing them with the top five songs on the Apple Music Store today."
01:16:09;01:16:10;"Why 2009?"
01:16:10;01:16:12;"Who knows why?"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"Someone wanted to."
01:16:14;01:16:15;"Simple as that."
01:16:16;01:16:17;"Seinfeld wanted to."
01:16:17;01:16:19;"Seinfeld, why'd you want to do 2009?"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"You're muted, pal."
01:16:21;01:16:21;"I can't hear you."
01:16:21;01:16:22;"You're muted."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"You're muted, bro."
01:16:24;01:16:25;"What's happening?"
01:16:25;01:16:26;"Oh, no."
01:16:26;01:16:41;"Seinfeld's having some technical difficulties."
01:16:41;01:16:45;"We may never find out why he picked 2009."
01:16:45;01:16:46;"Well, we're doing 2009."
01:16:46;01:16:48;"What T-shirt are you wearing?"
01:16:48;01:16:53;"Team Inside Tracks, 1994 Ventura, 30K, 5K."
01:16:53;01:16:55;"It's like a thrift store shirt."
01:16:55;01:16:59;"Yeah, I got this from Kyle Field when I was playing Little Wings."
01:16:59;01:17:05;"Every member in Little Wings would wear a teal T-shirt and brown dickies."
01:17:05;01:17:13;"That was the Little Wings look for those few years, circa like 2015, 16, 17."
01:17:13;01:17:15;"Teal and brown?"
01:17:15;01:17:15;"Yeah, teal and brown."
01:17:15;01:17:19;"And so Kyle provided teal T-shirts to everyone."
01:17:19;01:17:22;"So he found this in a Ventura County thrift store, I'm sure."
01:17:22;01:17:23;"Very nice."
01:17:23;01:17:24;"It's a good-ass shirt."
01:17:24;01:17:25;"Yeah."
01:17:25;01:17:27;"Is it working now?"
01:17:27;01:17:28;"Can you hear me?"
01:17:28;01:17:28;"Oh, yeah, we can hear you."
01:17:28;01:17:32;"Seinfeld, we were scared we weren't going to find out why you chose 2009."
01:17:32;01:17:35;"I wish there was a more..."
01:17:35;01:17:37;"Oh."
01:17:37;01:17:38;"Oh, dear."
01:17:38;01:17:43;"The universe does not want me to say, and maybe I should keep it that way."
01:17:43;01:17:44;"It's a secret."
01:17:44;01:17:46;"It was the year I graduated from high school."
01:17:46;01:17:47;"'09?"
01:17:47;01:17:47;"No, no."
01:17:47;01:17:53;"No, everybody knows that's..."
01:17:53;01:17:55;"How old are you, bro?"
01:17:55;01:18:00;"Seinfeld is actually the same age as Jerry Seinfeld, which I think is '68?"
01:18:00;01:18:03;"Yeah, I'm '68, guys."
01:18:03;01:18:04;"No, I don't know."
01:18:04;01:18:05;"There was an arbitrary..."
01:18:05;01:18:07;"It just felt like a year that we'd never done before."
01:18:07;01:18:10;"I threw it out there."
01:18:10;01:18:11;"No, it's a great call."
01:18:11;01:18:12;"Thank you."
01:18:12;01:18:17;"I mean, 2009 is a time I remember pretty well, just because it's like,"
01:18:17;01:18:21;"pretty easy for me to remember stuff based on Vampire Weekend records."
01:18:21;01:18:25;"So that'd be the year after the first one and the year before the second one."
01:18:25;01:18:31;"So I can more or less, I remember what I was doing, where I was, what was going on."
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Recording Contra."
01:18:32;01:18:35;"Right. Would have been in the studio recording Contra at this time."
01:18:35;01:18:36;"Very stressed out."
01:18:36;01:18:39;"July of '09."
01:18:39;01:18:40;"Yeah, July of '09."
01:18:40;01:18:47;"Kind of remember, I think that summer we went and opened for Blur in Hyde Park."
01:18:47;01:18:48;"Wow."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"At the time, it was like a big deal."
01:18:50;01:18:53;"Blur, the original line of Blur playing together for the first time."
01:18:53;01:18:59;"I guess at that time, maybe not that long, maybe eight years, but still, you know,"
01:18:59;01:19:01;"it felt like Blur's back."
01:19:01;01:19:06;"And so we felt very honored to get the opening slot for one of those shows."
01:19:06;01:19:09;"And I think that probably was like July."
01:19:09;01:19:13;"So I kind of remember going there and just being like, and it was fun."
01:19:13;01:19:15;"It was cool meeting them."
01:19:15;01:19:19;"But I just kind of remember being so stressed about like finishing the album."
01:19:19;01:19:23;"Like, oh God, now we got to go to England and we got to finish the record."
01:19:23;01:19:25;"And was just a one-off show in England."
01:19:25;01:19:26;"Yeah."
01:19:26;01:19:29;"But you know, next thing you know, that's like four days of your life."
01:19:29;01:19:32;"And when you're like, don't know how to manage stress yet."
01:19:32;01:19:35;"I mean, do you remember what the deadline was for Contra?"
01:19:35;01:19:41;"I remember at first I had a feeling, like a totally arbitrary, but again, what did I"
01:19:41;01:19:42;"know at the time?"
01:19:42;01:19:49;"I had a feeling like it was so important to come strong and quickly after our first album,"
01:19:49;01:19:53;"probably because I was like a little bit traumatized by people being like, oh,"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"this band's like a flash in the pan."
01:19:55;01:20:00;"This is just some new internet indie bullsh*t or whatever."
01:20:00;01:20:03;"I think I had this feeling like we really need to follow it up quickly."
01:20:03;01:20:08;"So I remember thinking if we work hard, we could get it out in 2009."
01:20:08;01:20:16;"And now maybe I'm a more evolved human being and I've embraced geologic time, deep time."
01:20:16;01:20:22;"And the idea of putting out records a year apart just seems absurd, not only absurd,"
01:20:22;01:20:25;"but probably like a bad idea."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"Not even like helpful."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"But back then, I don't know, it seemed like a good idea."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"And I guess occasionally that would happen."
01:20:30;01:20:34;"And I kind of felt like, oh, yeah, because I felt good about the material."
01:20:34;01:20:38;"So I felt like, oh, if we can finish this, get it out in '09, then we're really off to"
01:20:38;01:20:38;"the races."
01:20:38;01:20:41;"But again, looking back, it's a kind of an arbitrary thing."
01:20:41;01:20:41;"- I can see it."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"For sure."
01:20:43;01:20:48;"I remember feeling like we'd failed a little bit, that we couldn't get it out in '09."
01:20:48;01:20:53;"But I think what really happened is maybe we handed it in in August or something."
01:20:53;01:20:58;"And the label was like, hey, guys, take a few more weeks to really get the mixes right."
01:20:59;01:21:02;"And it's totally fine to put out in January 2010."
01:21:02;01:21:06;"And then I have this memory of kind of realizing like, oh, yeah, who cares?"
01:21:06;01:21:12;"And now when I think about it, putting out two records two years apart exactly is kind"
01:21:12;01:21:13;"of insane."
01:21:13;01:21:19;"Because if you go tour a record for like a full year, like totally wiped out and busy,"
01:21:19;01:21:23;"and then that leaves you like eight or nine months to make the next one with basically"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"no time off, very unappealing."
01:21:25;01:21:27;"But anyway, that's how I felt at the time."
01:21:27;01:21:30;"So the label didn't give us a deadline, but I had this arbitrary one in my head."
01:21:30;01:21:32;"Try to squeeze it out in '09."
01:21:32;01:21:35;"- You're trying to do it like you're some band in the '60s."
01:21:35;01:21:36;"- Yeah, basically."
01:21:36;01:21:38;"Self-titled January '08."
01:21:38;01:21:41;"Contra came out later that year in September."
01:21:41;01:21:42;"- Yeah."
01:21:42;01:21:44;"- That's like that real '60s [bleep]"
01:21:44;01:21:48;"- They recorded it in eight different cities."
01:21:48;01:21:50;"- Yeah."
01:21:50;01:21:52;"- And they would record tracks on their days off."
01:21:52;01:21:55;"- Anyway, Jake, what were you up to in 2009?"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"- Living in Oakland, California."
01:21:57;01:22:02;"I believe was doing grocery delivery."
01:22:02;01:22:03;"- Oh, still in '09?"
01:22:03;01:22:06;"- Yeah, I was 32 at the time."
01:22:06;01:22:12;"Painting a lot, part-time grocery delivery job, making a little money selling paintings."
01:22:12;01:22:17;"Not, pretty quiet period of my life."
01:22:17;01:22:19;"- Were you playing much music at the time?"
01:22:19;01:22:20;"- Not at all."
01:22:20;01:22:22;"I don't think I picked up a guitar in 2009."
01:22:22;01:22:22;"- Whoa."
01:22:22;01:22:27;"- I had my guitar, but it was just under the bed for years."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"I didn't touch it."
01:22:28;01:22:28;"Whoa."
01:22:28;01:22:32;"I didn't really start playing music again until I moved to LA in 2012."
01:22:32;01:22:33;"- And then the spirit moved you."
01:22:33;01:22:35;"- Spirit moved me, man."
01:22:35;01:22:38;"I was like, I'm walking in the shadows of giants."
01:22:38;01:22:39;"- That's right."
01:22:39;01:22:39;"- You know."
01:22:39;01:22:41;"- You're a SoCal guy at the end of the day."
01:22:41;01:22:43;"- Oh, absolutely."
01:22:43;01:22:44;"- All right, well, let's get into these."
01:22:44;01:22:51;"The number five song in '09, this moment in '09, Lady Gaga with ""Love Game."""

01:24:51;01:24:53;"- It's funny, it's like, this is..."
01:24:53;01:24:58;"Yeah, early Gaga, I guess there was a lot of music like this."
01:24:58;01:25:00;"I guess it's kind of what people now refer to"
01:25:00;01:25:04;"as the indie sleaze era, kind of like electro clash."
01:25:04;01:25:07;"And obviously, but it's the pop music"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"is the real indie sleaze, pop sleaze."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"There's a lot of like, just like kind of horny,"
01:25:11;01:25:15;"throwback, simple dance songs."
01:25:16;01:25:19;"I mean, this is before I think Gaga totally shown the world"
01:25:19;01:25:23;"her like provocative art side."
01:25:23;01:25:26;"This is way before art, the art ball."
01:25:26;01:25:28;"- What was her look this era though?"
01:25:28;01:25:28;"Was it..."
01:25:28;01:25:31;"- She was kind of like a, I mean, it was a little bit"
01:25:31;01:25:36;"like a slightly edgy nightclub person, like shiny."
01:25:36;01:25:39;"And I feel like the videos were always in like nightclubs."
01:25:39;01:25:41;"And this is almost her doing like a slightly more tasteful"
01:25:41;01:25:45;"version of like LMFAO and Black Eyed Peas."
01:25:45;01:25:47;"You know, and I think maybe the album after this,"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"or maybe later in this campaign,"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"she started making the really weird videos."
01:25:51;01:25:54;"And that's when I remember people talking about her and saying,"
01:25:54;01:25:57;"no, no, you're missing context for Lady Gaga."
01:25:57;01:25:59;"You have to see the videos."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"She's like a David Bowie or she's like playing"
01:26:01;01:26:02;"with the pop medium."
01:26:02;01:26:05;"And then it started to make more sense."
01:26:05;01:26:06;"- I remember hearing that and being like,"
01:26:06;01:26:08;"well, the music sucks though."
01:26:08;01:26:10;"So it's like, I don't care what the videos look like"
01:26:10;01:26:12;"because I don't care about music videos."
01:26:12;01:26:15;"And people are talking about David Bowie."
01:26:15;01:26:17;"I'm just like, get the hell out of here."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"- You were a classic rockist."
01:26:19;01:26:20;"- Oh my God, yeah."
01:26:20;01:26:24;"I was like, get the hell out of here."
01:26:24;01:26:25;"- Well, I guess."
01:26:25;01:26:27;"- Insane, insane."
01:26:27;01:26:28;"People are insane."
01:26:28;01:26:30;"- History proved them right, Jake."
01:26:30;01:26:32;"- I think history proved me right."
01:26:32;01:26:34;"Who's bumping early Gaga?"
01:26:34;01:26:38;"No, who's listening to Love Stick or what?"
01:26:38;01:26:39;"Love Game?"
01:26:39;01:26:42;"- I think a lot of people."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"- Oh yeah, I was on the disco stick from day one."
01:26:44;01:26:46;"- Okay, my bad."
01:26:46;01:26:49;"- You could definitely make a case for Lady Gaga saying that,"
01:26:49;01:26:52;"you know, this is like her, I wanna hold your hand."
01:26:52;01:26:56;"It's early, it's lowest common denominator."
01:26:56;01:26:58;"It's just like working within this idiom."
01:26:58;01:27:01;"And then over the course of her career, she did this well."
01:27:01;01:27:06;"But she went on to add, get weirder and wilder"
01:27:06;01:27:07;"and more provocative."
01:27:07;01:27:09;"- I think she's a great actor."
01:27:09;01:27:12;"And yeah, has fun with like putting on different clothes"
01:27:12;01:27:15;"and makeup and stuff, depending on the album cycle."
01:27:15;01:27:17;"But I don't think she has the catalog."
01:27:17;01:27:19;"- A lot of people would disagree with you there, Jake."
01:27:19;01:27:22;"- Lady Gaga essentials on Apple Music, hard pass."
01:27:22;01:27:25;"(laughing)"
01:27:25;01:27:26;"You wanna get--"
01:27:26;01:27:28;"- All right, you're just, you're not the target."
01:27:28;01:27:32;"- You wanna throw in Madonna, Apple Music essentials, I'm in."
01:27:32;01:27:33;"- No, but you know--"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"- I'll go Madonna deep cuts on Apple Music."
01:27:35;01:27:36;"- Interesting."
01:27:36;01:27:40;"No, I will, I definitely like Lady Gaga a lot more than you do."
01:27:40;01:27:43;"But I kind of feel like the moment, her kind of like"
01:27:43;01:27:47;"rubber soul revolver era, where like the early simple stuff"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"just kind of connected with something deeper,"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"it was bad romance."
01:27:51;01:27:54;"And you know, this is where the years between,"
01:27:54;01:27:56;"our slight generational difference, Jake, I think comes out."
01:27:56;01:27:57;"- Oh yeah."
01:27:57;01:27:59;"- 'Cause I kind of remember being like,"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"I was like intrigued by Lady Gaga from the jump."
01:28:01;01:28:03;"And I was, I wanna take a ride on your disco stick."
01:28:03;01:28:05;"It is funny."
01:28:05;01:28:07;"You can look at the song and see she's already got this blend"
01:28:07;01:28:11;"of kind of provocation, humor, an ear for a pop hook."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"But to me, there's something about bad romance"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"that was like when it all came together,"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"'cause it was like pure pop,"
01:28:17;01:28:20;"but also kind of like artsy and weird."
01:28:20;01:28:23;"And just her like saying her name"
01:28:23;01:28:24;"within the nonsense of it was,"
01:28:24;01:28:26;"♪ Ra ra oo mama ♪"
01:28:26;01:28:29;"♪ Gaga oo la la ♪"
01:28:29;01:28:30;"There was something about that moment"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"where I was just like, oh, okay."
01:28:32;01:28:33;"That's when I started to understand"
01:28:33;01:28:36;"like this was a major force."
01:28:36;01:28:37;"- That's where it clicked for you."
01:28:37;01:28:40;"- And there's something about like bad romance,"
01:28:40;01:28:42;"like the way she used language where it's like,"
01:28:42;01:28:43;"even calling it bad romance,"
01:28:43;01:28:48;"that almost sounds like something that if somebody,"
01:28:48;01:28:50;"you know, if somebody was like,"
01:28:50;01:28:52;"oh man, have you ever heard this like new wave,"
01:28:52;01:28:55;"this German new wave hit from 1984?"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"Like, no, what's it called?"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"It's called bad romance."
01:28:59;01:29:01;"And even the fact like, she's savvy."
01:29:01;01:29:04;"She like understood that calling it bad romance,"
01:29:04;01:29:05;"but she's from New York,"
01:29:05;01:29:06;"but it sounds like a German."
01:29:06;01:29:09;"♪ Ra ra oo mama ♪"
01:29:09;01:29:11;"♪ Want your bad romance ♪"
01:29:11;01:29:11;"It's like Falco."
01:29:11;01:29:14;"That really sounds like a German person."
01:29:14;01:29:16;"I want your bad romance."
01:29:16;01:29:19;"And yet it's so evocative and kind of dope."
01:29:19;01:29:20;"Anyway, that's the moment where I started."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"And I remember, what happened?"
01:29:22;01:29:24;"The video is like weird bondagey,"
01:29:24;01:29:28;"like Berlin global nightlife."
01:29:28;01:29:30;"But yeah, love game,"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"I don't think fully communicated that yet."
01:29:32;01:29:33;"But I think many great artists,"
01:29:33;01:29:36;"the early stuff, shows an ear for pop."
01:29:36;01:29:38;"- This is her lucky star."
01:29:38;01:29:41;"- And bad romance was maybe her like,"
01:29:41;01:29:44;"I don't know, like a prayer."
01:29:44;01:29:46;"- Yeah."
01:29:46;01:29:47;"- I don't know."
01:29:47;01:29:49;"- Untested Interscope records"
01:29:49;01:29:52;"is not going to let her come out the gate with bad romance."
01:29:52;01:29:54;"You gotta tee it up."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"- She built up to it quickly."
01:29:56;01:29:58;"I really think the Beatles analogy works here"
01:29:58;01:29:58;"where it's kind of like,"
01:29:58;01:30:01;"yeah, you're writing these great, fun hits."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"The kids are loving, she loves you."
01:30:03;01:30:04;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"All that stuff, it's fun."
01:30:06;01:30:08;"And then like in short order,"
01:30:08;01:30:14;"you drop Yesterday, Norwegian Wood, Tomorrow Never Knows."
01:30:14;01:30:16;"- I love this thesis paper you're drafting."
01:30:16;01:30:18;"- I need to work on it some more"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"'cause I haven't heard a lot of the early Gaga stuff in a while."
01:30:20;01:30:22;"I would argue the reason I haven't heard in a while"
01:30:22;01:30:24;"is because she has big catalog."
01:30:24;01:30:26;"The new stuff kind of pushed it down."
01:30:26;01:30:29;"Okay, the number five song in our era,"
01:30:29;01:30:30;"Harry Styles, As It Was."
01:30:30;01:30:33;"- Come on Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you."
01:30:38;01:30:39;"- You hear this song everywhere these days."
01:30:39;01:30:40;"- All right."
01:30:40;01:30:42;"- Let's get back to 2009."
01:30:42;01:30:44;"I don't think we wanna spend too much time on that."
01:30:44;01:30:45;"- I feel like we've heard this one a lot."
01:30:45;01:30:46;"- Yeah, we've heard this one a lot."
01:30:46;01:30:48;"Have you been hearing it around, Jake?"
01:30:48;01:30:48;"Has it grown on you?"
01:30:48;01:30:50;"- Yeah, I've heard it around."
01:30:50;01:30:51;"Yeah, it's cool."
01:30:51;01:30:55;"I mean, I find him very underwhelming, Harry Styles."
01:30:55;01:30:57;"There hasn't been one song where I'm just like,"
01:30:57;01:30:59;"damn, that's a hell of a song."
01:30:59;01:31:02;"I guess in a weird way that kind of proves that Jake"
01:31:02;01:31:05;"is neither a poptimist nor a rockist"
01:31:05;01:31:09;"because there's definitely probably someone out there"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"who'd be like, in '09 heard the early Gaga"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"and was like, this sucks."
01:31:13;01:31:15;"And then when Harry Styles came out,"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"would have been like, now this is what I'm talking about."
01:31:17;01:31:22;"This is pop music made by a dude who has an eye to the past,"
01:31:22;01:31:24;"appreciates the history of rock music,"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"but Jake's thumbs down on both."
01:31:26;01:31:28;"So in a way that I think that shows"
01:31:28;01:31:31;"that Jake is above genre allegiance."
01:31:31;01:31:33;"- I'm trying to play with an even hand here."
01:31:33;01:31:34;"- Because when Harry Styles first came out,"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"there definitely was a bit of,"
01:31:36;01:31:38;"I remember being at some event"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"where I think Cameron Crowe interviewed him."
01:31:40;01:31:42;"And there was this thing where it's kind of like,"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"for a certain type of like older rock fan,"
01:31:44;01:31:45;"it was kind of like, well, Harry Styles,"
01:31:45;01:31:48;"here's a pop star who likes rock music"
01:31:48;01:31:50;"and he shows that you can make pop music,"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"but have it be analog and whatever."
01:31:52;01:31:56;"And truthfully, this huge song as it was,"
01:31:56;01:31:56;"kind of is that."
01:31:56;01:31:58;"It is like an indie rock song,"
01:31:58;01:32:01;"like real drum sounds and a little new wave,"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"but there is a type of person somewhere"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"who heard that song and said,"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"now this is pop music I can get behind."
01:32:07;01:32:09;"That person is not Jake though,"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"because Jake's a real one."
01:32:11;01:32:12;"- I'm pretty out."
01:32:12;01:32:15;"- The number four song in '09,"
01:32:15;01:32:18;"Keri Hilson featuring Kanye West and Ne-Yo"
01:32:18;01:32:19;"with ""Knock You Down""."
01:32:19;01:32:20;"- Not again."
01:32:20;01:32:22;"- Love this song."

01:34:10;01:34:14;"Like I said, early VW days, going to England a lot,"
01:34:14;01:34:18;"touring there, working with our UK-based label, XL,"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"and like really experiencing like Radio 1"
01:34:21;01:34:23;"for the first time in my life,"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"like driving around in cars in the UK"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"and hearing Radio 1."
01:34:27;01:34:30;"And this era, and I think this is kind of true,"
01:34:30;01:34:34;"was also like the UK-ification of global pop."
01:34:34;01:34:37;"There was like types of songs and sounds"
01:34:37;01:34:40;"that would have been like big hits in the UK"
01:34:40;01:34:41;"but not the US."
01:34:41;01:34:43;"There's something changing about it."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"This reminds me of like the early days of that."
01:34:45;01:34:46;"- Huh."
01:34:46;01:34:48;"- There was something about pop music"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"that started to feel more UK."
01:34:50;01:34:51;"Which I know is a weird thing to say."
01:34:51;01:34:53;"All these artists on this song are American,"
01:34:53;01:34:56;"but there was like, maybe because in the UK,"
01:34:56;01:34:59;"dance music was always permanently a part of pop"
01:34:59;01:35:03;"because they have this kind of like rave dance culture."

01:35:58;01:36:00;"- Yeah, maybe a little bit."
01:36:00;01:36:02;"That came out in 2010."
01:36:02;01:36:04;"- I hear a little bit of this song in that record."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"- Yeah, I guess it was in there."
01:36:06;01:36:08;"- Just a very small thing about Carrie Hilson"
01:36:08;01:36:10;"'cause I was a big fan of hers"
01:36:10;01:36:13;"is that she was a very popular,"
01:36:13;01:36:16;"like The Dream, she's a really big songwriter"
01:36:16;01:36:19;"and she didn't do very much original material."
01:36:19;01:36:20;"So this is one,"
01:36:20;01:36:23;"so she wrote a lot for Britney Spears and Omarion."
01:36:23;01:36:24;"- Oh, I didn't know that."
01:36:24;01:36:27;"- So that was her, like The Dream."
01:36:27;01:36:30;"So this is like, I think she has one album."
01:36:30;01:36:33;"She doesn't have a lot of original material,"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"but is a great songwriter."
01:36:35;01:36:36;"- She never really was a singer."
01:36:36;01:36:39;"- This song came out almost 20 years exactly"
01:36:39;01:36:42;"to the month after Red Hot Chili Peppers'"
01:36:42;01:36:44;"""Knock Me Down"" off of Mother's Milk."
01:36:44;01:36:46;"- Oh yeah, that was 1989."
01:36:46;01:36:49;"Sometimes the universe works in mysterious ways like that."
01:36:49;01:36:52;"The 20 year cycle from ""Knock Me Down"" to ""Knock You Down."""
01:36:52;01:36:55;"- That is a hell of a historical tidbit, Seinfeld."
01:36:55;01:36:59;"- Should we just stick with 2009?"
01:36:59;01:37:02;"I don't think we need to get to 2022 right now."
01:37:02;01:37:03;"- Yeah."
01:37:03;01:37:07;"- All right, the number three song this week in 2009"
01:37:08;01:37:10;"was Drake with ""Best I Ever Had."""
01:37:10;01:37:11;"Now Seinfeld."
01:37:11;01:37:13;"- He had hits then?"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"- I mean, this was his first hit, right?"
01:37:15;01:37:16;"- This is it, yep."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"- This is it."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"- Wow."
01:37:18;01:37:20;"- Yeah, '09, Drake."
01:37:20;01:37:22;"- You know who directed the music video?"
01:37:22;01:37:23;"- Who?"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"- Kanye West."
01:37:25;01:37:26;"- Really?"

01:38:03;01:38:03;"- Uh-huh."
01:38:03;01:38:06;"- There's not a lot of context for Drake yet."
01:38:06;01:38:09;"- Wait, Matt, can we listen to what the song samples?"
01:38:09;01:38:12;"""Falling in Love"" by Hamilton, Joe Frank, and Reynolds."

01:38:36;01:38:41;"- Yeah, I think they used that piano."
01:38:41;01:38:42;"- Uh-huh."
01:38:42;01:38:44;"- All right, we get the idea."
01:38:44;01:38:48;"Oh yeah, and there's that (imitates piano)"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"Jake, did you ever like spend serious time"
01:38:50;01:38:53;"with Drake's music over the past 15 years?"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"- No, never."
01:38:55;01:38:56;"Never listened to a Drake record."
01:38:56;01:39:00;"Only really have heard his music on this show."
01:39:00;01:39:01;"- Really?"
01:39:01;01:39:04;"- I mean, I'm sure I've heard it in like Ubers"
01:39:04;01:39:08;"or like at the like, you know, grocery store or whatever."
01:39:08;01:39:09;"At the corner store."

01:39:30;01:39:32;"- I'll count it."

01:39:34;01:39:36;"(laughs)"
01:39:36;01:39:36;"Best I ever had."
01:39:36;01:39:39;"- Nick, no, no, no, that does not count."

01:39:48;01:39:49;"- I just looked."
01:39:49;01:39:49;"- Okay, one more."
01:39:49;01:39:52;"I thought when I said three, it might be too easy."

01:39:59;01:40:01;"- Oh, it's ""Hotline,"" okay."
01:40:01;01:40:03;"I thought it was ""Highline,"" like the highline in New York."
01:40:03;01:40:04;"That's where the song takes place."

01:42:05;01:42:06;"you need to know about this song"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"is that it's called ""Worst Behavior"""
01:42:08;01:42:11;"and he spelled behavior the Canadian English way."
01:42:11;01:42:12;"- Oh, nice."
01:42:12;01:42:15;"- Where it ends in I-O-U-R."
01:42:15;01:42:16;"So there's something about this though,"
01:42:16;01:42:17;"which is also peak Drake,"
01:42:17;01:42:19;"where he purposefully spelled it in this way"
01:42:19;01:42:22;"that he knew would kind of like provoke Americans."
01:42:22;01:42:26;"And then also this was him being like hard."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"'Cause I feel like Drake came out,"
01:42:27;01:42:29;"he was doing like you the (beep) best,"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"like kind of like, almost like novelty,"
01:42:31;01:42:33;"sweet, romantic stuff."
01:42:33;01:42:35;"And then he would drop hard songs every now and then,"
01:42:35;01:42:37;"and then people would be really mean to him."
01:42:37;01:42:39;"And then he almost like,"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"through like sheer force of will,"
01:42:41;01:42:43;"was like, I'm gonna make hard songs"
01:42:43;01:42:45;"that are actually like hard enough that like,"
01:42:45;01:42:48;"and I get big enough that I weirdly transcend the haters."
01:42:48;01:42:50;"And I feel like this was the era"
01:42:50;01:42:52;"where people did kind of like,"
01:42:52;01:42:54;"I mean, he definitely sounds angry."
01:42:55;01:42:57;"Also just Drake, his entire career,"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"figuring out a million different ways"
01:42:59;01:43:02;"to kind of tackle the hip hop cliche"
01:43:02;01:43:03;"of basically being like,"
01:43:03;01:43:05;"""(beep) the haters, I'm rich."""
01:43:05;01:43:06;"You know, you would think at some point,"

01:43:09;01:43:10;"that's been done."
01:43:10;01:43:13;"And maybe you wanna listen to a more abstract rapper"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"or somebody who talks about anything else."
01:43:15;01:43:18;"Yet that Drake and his team specializes"
01:43:18;01:43:21;"in just figuring out ways to say it."
01:43:21;01:43:23;"""Mother(beep) never loved us."""
01:43:23;01:43:24;"So angry."

01:43:43;01:43:44;"I really respect that."
01:43:44;01:43:45;"Yeah."
01:43:45;01:43:47;"'Cause even look at like a Kanye,"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"who is a very different type of artist,"
01:43:49;01:43:52;"but a peer and somebody from the same era,"
01:43:52;01:43:53;"a bit older, but you know, still."
01:43:54;01:43:57;"They were two of the biggest rappers at the same time."
01:43:57;01:44:00;"And, you know, Kanye figures out a lot of ways to say that."
01:44:00;01:44:03;"But, you know, he's also, he's concerned with spirituality."
01:44:03;01:44:06;"He's concerned with like the intricacies of business,"
01:44:06;01:44:09;"American culture."
01:44:09;01:44:09;"Yeah."
01:44:09;01:44:12;"Whereas Drake is just like slicing that onion"
01:44:12;01:44:14;"thinner than you ever thought possible."
01:44:14;01:44:15;"Yet another way to say it."
01:44:15;01:44:17;"It's just like, yeah, it's like, he's like,"
01:44:17;01:44:19;"there's like Sergio Leone or something."
01:44:19;01:44:21;"I'm gonna make another Western."
01:44:21;01:44:22;"Yeah."
01:44:22;01:44:23;"I work in genre."
01:44:23;01:44:25;"And Drake's mixed it up a little bit with the beats,"
01:44:25;01:44:30;"but he's just, it's always that thin Drakey slice of humanity."
01:44:30;01:44:34;"Anyway, that song was produced by DJ Dahe, who I love."
01:44:34;01:44:39;"We worked together a bit on Father of the Bride."
01:44:39;01:44:39;"And..."
01:44:39;01:44:40;"Oh, really?"
01:44:40;01:44:42;"Yeah. We actually, yeah, we've got a bunch of cool demos."
01:44:42;01:44:44;"We started talking about getting back."
01:44:44;01:44:45;"What did he do on Father?"
01:44:45;01:44:48;"We made some cool songs that actually haven't seen the light of day,"
01:44:48;01:44:52;"but he, Big Blue, we made the original beat together."
01:44:53;01:44:56;"That song went on a whole journey, but we made that original beat together."
01:44:56;01:44:58;"Oh, we also worked on the song My Mistake."
01:44:58;01:45:00;"He had some really cool to that song."
01:45:00;01:45:06;"I noticed his name on Sunflower was where I, where his credit popped up for me."
01:45:06;01:45:08;"Oh, do you work on Sunflower too?"
01:45:08;01:45:08;"I think so."
01:45:08;01:45:13;"Well, he worked on a bunch of songs on Father, but yeah, he's very versatile."
01:45:13;01:45:18;"Like he became known for hip hop, but he's like the type of dude, he knows all music."
01:45:18;01:45:24;"He's also pretty well known for having been on, I think the last three Kendrick albums."
01:45:24;01:45:27;"And he's been releasing some like solo music too."
01:45:27;01:45:28;"Shout out to DJ Dahe."
01:45:28;01:45:30;"Yeah, Drake."
01:45:30;01:45:32;"I mean, it's funny."
01:45:32;01:45:37;"Going back to '09 and just immediately hearing an early Lady Gaga song, an early Drake song."
01:45:37;01:45:39;"Clearly '09 was the start of something."
01:45:39;01:45:40;"Yeah."
01:45:40;01:45:44;"For better or for worse, two of the biggest artists of the last, how far are we out now?"
01:45:44;01:45:45;"13 years."
01:45:45;01:45:46;"Crazy."
01:45:46;01:45:50;"Okay, the number two song back in '09."
01:45:50;01:45:51;"Okay."

01:47:34;01:47:35;"Good question, man."
01:47:35;01:47:39;"It was probably a mix of some new indie stuff, but probably still a lot of..."
01:47:39;01:47:42;"Indie or Nickelback kind of stuff."
01:47:42;01:47:48;"In 2009, they might have occasionally played an MGMT song, but yeah, they might have still"
01:47:48;01:47:51;"been playing Nickelback or kind of post-grunge."
01:47:51;01:47:55;"Or some of that stuff we were listening to last episode from..."
01:47:55;01:47:57;"Oh yeah, modern rock."
01:47:57;01:48:00;"Yeah, like ""Hooba Stank"" and ""Puddle of Blood."""

01:48:01;01:48:03;"♪ Yup, yup ♪"

01:48:17;01:48:19;"Yeah, it's more this kind of slightly '80s..."
01:48:20;01:48:23;"Yeah, I never understood why this band was so big."
01:48:23;01:48:25;"I'll take Gaga over this any day of the week."
01:48:25;01:48:27;"Ooh."
01:48:27;01:48:29;"I mean, this band really scrapes the bottom of the barrel."
01:48:29;01:48:32;"This is rough stuff."
01:48:32;01:48:34;"I'm not trying to be a contrarian."
01:48:34;01:48:36;"I don't agree, Jake."
01:48:36;01:48:41;"I mean, I've also met people who really grew up with the P's."
01:48:41;01:48:43;"The P's?"
01:48:43;01:48:45;"I've been in situations where..."
01:48:45;01:48:47;"Hey man, I grew up with the P's, dude."
01:48:47;01:48:53;"I've done like a video watchdown of like Black Eyed Peas stuff with like a mix of people."
01:48:53;01:48:57;"Like some people who are like young when this came out, some people were older."
01:48:57;01:48:58;"P-heads."
01:48:58;01:48:59;"They're called P-bodies."
01:48:59;01:49:04;"I think I told you guys that because I read one of their memoirs."
01:49:04;01:49:09;"Some of the videos from this era, there is like a charm to it."
01:49:09;01:49:10;"And they..."
01:49:10;01:49:12;"I don't think ""Boom Boom Pow"" is one of the best,"
01:49:12;01:49:15;"but they had other kind of fun songs in this era."
01:49:15;01:49:17;"What's the one where they go, ""Switch up""?"
01:49:17;01:49:19;"""Switch up."""
01:49:19;01:49:21;"Oh, what?"
01:49:21;01:49:22;"The ""Dirty Bit""?"
01:49:22;01:49:22;"I had the time of my life."
01:49:22;01:49:23;"Oh yeah, ""Dirty Bit""."
01:49:23;01:49:24;"Oh yeah, maybe."
01:49:24;01:49:26;"There's something like so..."
01:49:26;01:49:32;"I can't put my finger on it, but there's something about Black Eyed Peas, Drake, and Lady Gaga."
01:49:32;01:49:37;"They all had like a deep confidence in themselves."
01:49:37;01:49:40;"And I know that probably sounds a little bit vague."
01:49:40;01:49:45;"What era do people with top five hits not have confidence?"
01:49:45;01:49:45;"Fair point."
01:49:45;01:49:47;"Only 90s."
01:49:47;01:49:50;"And yet there's something about these artists that are just like so..."
01:49:50;01:49:52;"I don't know."
01:49:52;01:49:57;"I don't like getting into generational stuff because I don't buy most of it."
01:49:57;01:49:59;"But there's just like a deep confidence."
01:49:59;01:50:02;"It's like they knew they were at the top of their game."
01:50:02;01:50:03;"They were owning culture."
01:50:03;01:50:09;"They were making a kind of like simple pop music with like a deep, deep confidence."
01:50:09;01:50:09;"I don't know."
01:50:09;01:50:11;"It's very evocative to me."
01:50:11;01:50:13;"They're like, ""We're making garbage music,"
01:50:13;01:50:17;"but we're very successful and having huge hits with it."""
01:50:17;01:50:21;"It was like a bit of a Gold Rush vibe, I guess."
01:50:21;01:50:23;"I don't know what the number one song is going to be,"
01:50:23;01:50:27;"but I want to say that we haven't heard a one hit wonder, really."
01:50:27;01:50:32;"I mean, like I said, maybe Carrie Hilson, but that has Kanye and Neo on it."
01:50:32;01:50:33;"I mean, to go this far back and have..."
01:50:33;01:50:35;"What happened to the Black Eyed Peas?"
01:50:35;01:50:36;"Are they still around?"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"Oh yeah, and they still have huge hits."
01:50:38;01:50:41;"My vague impression last time I went down..."
01:50:42;01:50:45;"I went down the Black Eyed Peas rabbit hole with..."
01:50:45;01:50:49;"The last time I went down the pea hole with a group of pea bodies."
01:50:49;01:50:55;"I should also point out, Jake, that in the early days of this show,"
01:50:55;01:50:57;"we used to spend a lot of time in Will.i.am studio."
01:50:57;01:50:59;"Remember, we used to record TC."
01:50:59;01:51:01;"Will.i.am owned that studio."
01:51:01;01:51:02;"In Hollywood somewhere."
01:51:02;01:51:03;"Really?"
01:51:03;01:51:04;"I didn't realize that."
01:51:04;01:51:05;"Yeah, he owned that Hollywood studio."
01:51:05;01:51:07;"Well, Mr. I.am, I'm sorry."
01:51:07;01:51:08;"I ran into him once."
01:51:08;01:51:09;"I'm a straight shooter."
01:51:09;01:51:10;"I saw him there once."
01:51:10;01:51:11;"You ran into him?"
01:51:11;01:51:12;"Yeah, did you say what's up?"
01:51:12;01:51:12;"Once."
01:51:12;01:51:14;"He was sort of on a mission."
01:51:14;01:51:20;"But yeah, he was wearing like futuristic sunglasses and the whole Will.i.am get up."
01:51:20;01:51:23;"And remember that studio had all these like trapezoids and stuff?"
01:51:23;01:51:24;"Like it was kind of like Will.i.am."
01:51:24;01:51:27;"It was made for Will.i.am specifically."
01:51:27;01:51:30;"You ran up to him, you're like, ""Mr. I.am, I just want to introduce myself."
01:51:30;01:51:31;"I'm Seinfeld 2000."""
01:51:31;01:51:34;"He just looked at you like, ""2000?"
01:51:34;01:51:35;"I want to meet Seinfeld 3000."""
01:51:35;01:51:37;"Pushed past you."
01:51:37;01:51:39;"You're like, ""Oh no, but it's kind of an ironic thing."
01:51:39;01:51:40;"Oh."""
01:51:41;01:51:43;"""I'm not interested in the 2000."
01:51:43;01:51:45;"I'm not interested in the past."
01:51:45;01:51:48;"I'm not interested in the past, Seinfeld 2000."""
01:51:48;01:51:51;"He actually called me Seinfeld 2000 and late."
01:51:51;01:51:54;"Seinfeld 2000 and late."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"Which was a diss."
01:51:55;01:51:59;"Black Eyed Peas, my vague memory is that they kind of like peaked."
01:51:59;01:52:00;"They crushed it so hard."
01:52:00;01:52:05;"Just like nonstop hits, touring the world, true global superstars."
01:52:05;01:52:10;"At some point, maybe Fergie left and it was like kind of like the end of an era."
01:52:11;01:52:16;"Maybe Will.i.am was producing other things and probably, I imagine."
01:52:16;01:52:19;"I think he's a big, big businessman."
01:52:19;01:52:20;"Oh, definitely."
01:52:20;01:52:20;"I want to say."
01:52:20;01:52:21;"He probably invented NFTs."
01:52:21;01:52:23;"Maybe very into crypto."
01:52:23;01:52:26;"Yeah, I was going to say very crypto."
01:52:26;01:52:29;"So I think at some point they kind of went on a hiatus or something."
01:52:29;01:52:35;"I think at some point in the past five years, they came back with a bit of a back to basics record."
01:52:35;01:52:40;"Because when they started, they were considered kind of like conscious hip hop."
01:52:40;01:52:45;"Their early music was not pop at all, really."
01:52:45;01:52:48;"And there's even out there, there's some random P-bodies who are just like,"
01:52:48;01:52:53;"""Oh man, after the first album, I was so let down by the direction they went in."""
01:52:53;01:52:57;"But then I think they finally went back and did kind of almost like a political"
01:52:57;01:53:02;"rap album, which I don't think made much impact."
01:53:02;01:53:05;"Maybe because at that point, people only wanted one thing from the Peas."
01:53:05;01:53:09;"And then after that, they just started, they went back to just dropping massive hits."
01:53:09;01:53:13;"And they did like, you know, and teaming up with like reggaeton superstars."
01:53:13;01:53:17;"They did a song that just straight up is like a kind of a remix of,"
01:53:17;01:53:19;"""This is the rhythm of the night."""
01:53:19;01:53:20;"Except they like chop it up."
01:53:20;01:53:22;"""This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm."""
01:53:22;01:53:24;"Oh, I've heard that."
01:53:24;01:53:25;"Yeah, that's them."
01:53:25;01:53:29;"So that's like another giant hit, you know, 20 years into their career."
01:53:29;01:53:31;"And maybe my least favorite band."
01:53:31;01:53:34;"Well, Jake, I got some bad news for you."
01:53:34;01:53:38;"Because the number one song this week in 2009 was also the Black Eyed Peas."
01:53:38;01:53:41;"With maybe their biggest song of all time."
01:53:41;01:53:41;"Oh my God."
01:53:41;01:53:42;"You remember this one?"
01:53:42;01:53:43;"I got a feeling."
01:53:43;01:53:47;"I don't know."
01:53:47;01:53:50;"Yeah, this is them with David Guetta."
01:53:50;01:53:51;"Oh man."
01:53:51;01:53:56;"When I hear that rhythm of the night thing, I just like, I'm always like, ""Why?"""
01:53:56;01:53:58;"So I'm driving."
01:53:58;01:53:59;"God."
01:53:59;01:54:02;"This weekend, I'm driving a bunch of kids around, a bunch of 10 year olds."
01:54:02;01:54:05;"And they asked me to put this song on."
01:54:05;01:54:06;"Really?"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"They said, ""Hey, can you throw on Black Eyed Peas?"
01:54:08;01:54:09;"I got a feeling."""
01:54:09;01:54:12;"I mean, the fact this is still in the ether."
01:54:12;01:54:13;"Well, you know what?"
01:54:13;01:54:18;"For them, this is like, ""Don't Stop Believing"" by Journey is to millennials."
01:54:18;01:54:25;"It's like this kind of cheesy, but epic song that came out a few years before you were born."
01:54:25;01:54:27;"And probably..."
01:54:27;01:54:33;"I could also see it being used in every animated kids movie trailer forever."
01:54:33;01:54:34;"Oh, oh, totally."
01:54:35;01:54:36;"Yeah, you could picture..."
01:54:36;01:54:45;"Wreck-It Ralph, Shrek, Nemo, all dancing to this, having a big old party."
01:54:48;01:54:56;"That tonight's gonna be a good night."
01:54:56;01:55:10;"That tonight's gonna be a good night."
01:55:19;01:55:21;"Yeah, I hate this music."
01:55:21;01:55:33;"I rarely viscerally am repulsed as hard as I am by the Black Eyed Peas."
01:55:39;01:55:40;"The genius of this song is I feel like"
01:55:40;01:55:46;"nobody had a song dedicated to before going out."
01:55:46;01:55:51;"Yeah, I feel like the 2000s is when people started using the word ""pre-game"" a lot."
01:55:51;01:55:55;"Like, ""What do you play when you're getting ready to go out?"""
01:55:55;01:55:58;"Jake, when you were in college, did people talk about pre-gaming?"
01:55:58;01:55:59;"I wasn't going to like..."
01:55:59;01:56:00;"Well, actually, that's not true."
01:56:00;01:56:04;"I went to some keggers back in my day."
01:56:04;01:56:07;"You would have been like, ""I don't talk about pre-gaming at..."""
01:56:07;01:56:10;"You don't have to be like big man on campus to pre-game."
01:56:10;01:56:11;"Yeah, no, I don't..."
01:56:11;01:56:15;"You never talked about pre-gaming before going to like a fish show or a dead show?"
01:56:15;01:56:20;"A hundred percent that term was used when I was in high school before going out."
01:56:20;01:56:23;"I mean, definitely when I was in college, people were talking about pre-gaming."
01:56:23;01:56:25;"I mean, you probably pre-gamed a lot. You just didn't..."
01:56:25;01:56:28;"Yeah, it wasn't a word."
01:56:28;01:56:29;"When I was like in college..."
01:56:29;01:56:32;"Yeah, you're probably like, ""All right, stop by my room."
01:56:32;01:56:36;"We'll crush a brew, listen to some music, then we'll head over to the party."""
01:56:36;01:56:40;"Yeah, it would have been more succinct to say pre-game, but yeah, it wasn't in the lexicon."
01:56:40;01:56:44;"I feel like that entered my lexicon when I was in my 30s."
01:56:44;01:56:48;"Yeah, probably around this era. Probably in the ""I got a feeling"" era."
01:56:48;01:56:49;"I forgot they dropped a mazel tov."
01:56:49;01:56:53;"Oh, yeah, and then he goes, ""L'chaim!"""
01:56:53;01:56:57;"Will.i.am has a Saturn dealership in La Jolla."
01:56:57;01:56:59;"Okay, yeah."
01:56:59;01:57:00;"Wait, he actually does?"
01:57:00;01:57:01;"No, I'm kidding."
01:57:01;01:57:03;"He's a hell of a businessman."
01:57:04;01:57:17;"I always thought it was great that Will.i.am, his name is also a website."
01:57:17;01:57:24;"Like, will.i.am is his website, so whenever it was typed in news articles, if you clicked on it,"
01:57:24;01:57:28;"it would like... HTML would automatically link to his site."
01:57:28;01:57:28;"I mean, that's hilarious."
01:57:28;01:57:30;"I mean, he's a genius."
01:57:30;01:57:32;"Yeah, I'm looking at his website right now."
01:57:33;01:57:37;"He's selling some very expensive clothing."
01:57:37;01:57:42;"He's got some Letterman jackets for $2,484."
01:57:42;01:57:43;"They're all sold out."
01:57:43;01:57:43;"Damn."
01:57:43;01:57:45;"He did a collab with Mercedes."
01:57:45;01:57:47;"He made his own AMG."
01:57:47;01:57:50;"Oh, Will.i.am G."
01:57:50;01:57:52;"Yeah, Will.i.am G."
01:57:52;01:57:53;"I'm gonna get one of those."
01:57:53;01:57:54;"You know what's crazy?"
01:57:54;01:58:01;"I looked at the top five from 2022, and guess who has the number one song this week in 2022?"
01:58:02;01:58:03;"Drake."
01:58:03;01:58:03;"Drake."
01:58:03;01:58:05;"Right, because he dropped an album recently."
01:58:05;01:58:08;"So I'm just curious, you're a Canadian hip hop fan."
01:58:08;01:58:10;"Did you listen to the new Drake record?"
01:58:10;01:58:13;"Yeah, I checked it out."
01:58:13;01:58:14;"What's the scene report?"
01:58:14;01:58:16;"I mean, you're putting me on the spot here."
01:58:16;01:58:18;"I'm not really like... I mean, techno."
01:58:18;01:58:20;"Like, it's a house music album."
01:58:20;01:58:21;"Okay."
01:58:21;01:58:22;"It's not really..."
01:58:22;01:58:23;"I mean, yeah, Drake does mix it up."
01:58:23;01:58:26;"He mixes it up in his own way."
01:58:26;01:58:28;"Yeah, this is... I mean, it's a departure."
01:58:29;01:58:31;"I mean, it seems like it's very in the zeitgeist."
01:58:31;01:58:35;"Like, the new Beyonce is also kind of on the same wave."
01:58:35;01:58:40;"Like, I've seen a lot of talk about how dance music sort of corresponds with, like,"
01:58:40;01:58:43;"the recession era sounds."
01:58:43;01:58:46;"So it seems like he's in the zeitgeist again."
01:58:46;01:58:46;"But it's not..."
01:58:46;01:58:46;"Is that true?"
01:58:46;01:58:49;"That people want to dance more when there's a..."
01:58:49;01:58:55;"Yeah, there's some correlations between house music and, like, economic disparity."
01:58:55;01:58:58;"At this point, it feels like everything's been so done."
01:58:58;01:59:02;"It almost seems like it's like stockbrokers studying trends."
01:59:02;01:59:06;"I mean, yeah, if somebody wanted to say, like, well, house music came out of Chicago and,"
01:59:06;01:59:12;"you know, marginalized queer people of color making music just for themselves."
01:59:12;01:59:13;"Like, I get that."
01:59:13;01:59:16;"But is there really, like, a correlation between, like..."
01:59:16;01:59:20;"Well, I guess, was dance music big during the '09 crash?"
01:59:20;01:59:23;"I guess Black Eyed Peas, I got a feeling."
01:59:23;01:59:24;"Yeah, Gaga."
01:59:24;01:59:27;"I mean, I think we're kind of hearing the pop version of it."
01:59:27;01:59:29;"But I'll leave you with one last thought."
01:59:29;01:59:35;"You keep seeing people because of, like, Joe Biden and Trump and all and Nancy Pelosi and"
01:59:35;01:59:37;"Mitch McConnell, these people are all, like, old."
01:59:37;01:59:41;"You see more and more use of the word gerontocracy."
01:59:41;01:59:42;"Great word."
01:59:42;01:59:44;"A state society, a group governed by old people."
01:59:44;01:59:49;"And clearly, both the Democrats and the Republicans are a type of gerontocracy."
01:59:49;01:59:51;"Or look at the Supreme Court."
01:59:51;01:59:56;"Obviously, you have some of the deciding votes and the decisions affecting millions of people's"
01:59:56;01:59:59;"lives and their rights being cast by pretty old people."
01:59:59;02:00:03;"Not exclusively, but, you know, I mean, that's the nature of the Supreme Court, I guess,"
02:00:03;02:00:04;"with the lifetime appointments."
02:00:04;02:00:09;"It is interesting that hip hop, which has always been one of the most youthful genres,"
02:00:09;02:00:14;"Drake holding onto power so firmly, is he turning hip hop into a gerontocracy?"
02:00:14;02:00:16;"Nick, you have an opinion on that."
02:00:16;02:00:19;"Is Drake turning hip hop into a gerontocracy?"
02:00:19;02:00:26;"I don't think so, mainly because most of the people, like 21 Savage being the number one"
02:00:26;02:00:30;"song of that record is the one with 21 Savage, right?"
02:00:30;02:00:32;"I mean, I feel like he's still..."
02:00:32;02:00:34;"How old is 21 Savage?"
02:00:34;02:00:35;"Good question, but..."
02:00:35;02:00:37;"Oh, he's 29."
02:00:37;02:00:37;"Okay."
02:00:37;02:00:39;"Yeah, he's younger than Drake."
02:00:39;02:00:41;"Is Drake 40?"
02:00:41;02:00:45;"No, Drake's probably mid-30s."
02:00:45;02:00:47;"So he was young when..."
02:00:47;02:00:48;"Okay."
02:00:48;02:00:54;"The bigger thing is, I think that I would say that this album, when you talked about"
02:00:55;02:01:01;"him just slicing that onion thinner and thinner, it's like he's using some different beats,"
02:01:01;02:01:02;"but he really..."
02:01:02;02:01:08;"If anything, this is so interesting because it is like he's entering his Sinatra years,"
02:01:08;02:01:13;"as a friend said to me, where he's just going in the studio, laying something down,"
02:01:13;02:01:15;"doesn't feel like he's spending too much time on it."
02:01:15;02:01:16;"Sounds like a classic."
02:01:16;02:01:17;"You could see him doing..."
02:01:17;02:01:20;"I could really see Drake doing a residency in Vegas."
02:01:20;02:01:22;"Oh, totally."
02:01:22;02:01:23;"Yeah, it'd be huge."
02:01:23;02:01:25;"It'd be easy."
02:01:25;02:01:29;"And yeah, so in that way, it does feel like he's..."
02:01:29;02:01:34;"It's a gerontocracy, but I do feel like he's sort of alone here."
02:01:34;02:01:39;"But it's really amazing how he's like too big to fail, because I'm not even judging"
02:01:39;02:01:39;"the music."
02:01:39;02:01:40;"I haven't heard the..."
02:01:40;02:01:43;"I actually haven't heard the last two records."
02:01:43;02:01:44;"And knowing him..."
02:01:44;02:01:45;"This one's definitely better."
02:01:45;02:01:48;"Knowing him, I'm sure there's interesting stuff on both of them."
02:01:48;02:01:50;"It's just kind of amazing that it's like..."
02:01:50;02:01:54;"I guess what I'm picking up on is this thing that like, similar to some of these older"
02:01:54;02:02:01;"politicians, that there's always people waiting for Trump to flop and Joe Biden to flop and"
02:02:01;02:02:06;"youthful energy to come in and get rid of these old people and forward-thinking ideas."
02:02:06;02:02:08;"And yet, they just never seem to flop."
02:02:08;02:02:09;"I don't know."
02:02:09;02:02:13;"Think about in the Obama years, if you said that like the next two presidents were going"
02:02:13;02:02:16;"to be Trump and then Biden, you'd just be like..."
02:02:16;02:02:19;"Well, you'd say what for quite a variety of reasons."
02:02:19;02:02:24;"But especially with like, again, politics aside, just like the kind of youthful president,"
02:02:24;02:02:28;"this new era, boom boom pow, I got a feeling on the radio."
02:02:28;02:02:32;"New artists like Gaga and Drake, it felt like, you know..."
02:02:32;02:02:33;"But I guess that's what happens."
02:02:33;02:02:35;"Everybody's young and then everybody's old."
02:02:35;02:02:36;"And sometimes the old..."
02:02:36;02:02:38;"The old hold on to power."
02:02:38;02:02:43;"I guess I would have thought that by now, Drake maybe would just be like, not as culturally"
02:02:43;02:02:44;"dominant."
02:02:44;02:02:48;"Just like if you told me like Joe Biden, like if you told me back in the day, ""Well, you"
02:02:48;02:02:52;"know, Trump is still going to be all on TV in 2022."""
02:02:52;02:02:52;"I'd say, ""Yeah, right."
02:02:52;02:02:53;"That makes sense."""
02:02:53;02:02:56;"""Oh, and Joe Biden, he's still going to be a senator."""
02:02:56;02:02:56;"Yeah, right."
02:02:56;02:02:58;"But you know what I mean?"
02:02:58;02:03:02;"Something about the holding the top, top spot seems meaningful."
02:03:02;02:03:04;"Anyway, we'll figure that out next time."
02:03:04;02:03:06;"You're saying Drake is like Joe Biden, sort of?"
02:03:06;02:03:07;"A little bit."
02:03:07;02:03:11;"I can cosign that."
02:03:11;02:03:15;"All right."
02:03:15;02:03:16;"Another TC in the can."
02:03:16;02:03:20;"Thank you to Skulls Unlimited and The Bone Room for sponsoring this episode."
02:03:20;02:03:21;"We'll see you next time."
