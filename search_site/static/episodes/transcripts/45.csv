00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:03;00:06;"I'm rejoined by my good friend Jake,"
00:06;00:09;"who's been on a wedding tour across America."
00:09;00:14;"We'll be talking about the last stand of Belgium's Wendy's,"
00:14;00:16;"and not the Wendy's you think."
00:16;00:19;"We'll also be joined by Kazzy David"
00:19;00:22;"to discuss clubbing,"
00:22;00:24;"Niall Horan,"
00:24;00:26;"and Seinfeld trivia."
00:26;00:29;"All this on a very special..."
00:29;00:33;"Time Crisis, with Ezra King."
00:33;00:35;"B-B-B-Beast..."
00:35;00:37;"One."
00:37;00:40;"# They passed me by"
00:40;00:43;"# All of those great romances"
00:43;00:47;"# They were a wealth of a belief"
00:47;00:50;"# All my rightful chances"
00:50;00:53;"# My picture clear"
00:53;00:58;"# Everything seemed so easy"
00:58;01:02;"# And so I dealt to the blow"
01:02;01:05;"# One of us had to go"
01:05;01:07;"# Now it's different"
01:07;01:10;"# I want you to know"
01:10;01:13;"# One of us is crying"
01:13;01:16;"# One of us is lying"
01:16;01:20;"# Leave a lonely way... #"
01:20;01:24;"Time Crisis, Los Angeles, California."
01:24;01:26;"What's up, Jake?"
01:26;01:28;"It's June 2017."
01:28;01:30;"That's right. Deep in 2017 now."
01:30;01:32;"- Jeez. - Almost halfway done."
01:32;01:34;"I know it's a cliche, but the year is flying by."
01:34;01:36;"It's good to see you, Jake."
01:36;01:38;"You've been on the road a lot lately, man."
01:38;01:40;"I feel like you're on a wedding tour."
01:40;01:41;"It's true."
01:41;01:44;"I'm getting texts from you, seeing Instagrams,"
01:44;01:46;"where I'm just trying to figure out where you are."
01:46;01:49;"You know when you see a picture of some random bus,"
01:49;01:51;"and you're just like, ""Where is that?"""
01:51;01:53;"I know that's not an LA bus, not a New York bus."
01:53;01:55;"Or just a weird pizza hut,"
01:55;01:58;"and then the location on my gram just says, like,"
01:58;02:00;"Pineville, Minnesota."
02:00;02:04;"Like a weird CVS in suburban Minneapolis."
02:04;02:06;"So what's going on? I guess it's springtime."
02:06;02:09;"- It's wedding season. - I've been to two weddings"
02:09;02:12;"far from LA in the last three weeks."
02:12;02:15;"But the good news is I'm done for the summer. That's it."
02:15;02:17;"- Oh, really? You banged it out? - Yeah, banged it out."
02:17;02:21;"Yeah, 'cause some people got, like, seven, eight weddings a season."
02:21;02:23;"- That's insane. That's crazy. - So both of these people"
02:23;02:25;"- were your girlfriend's friends? - Yeah."
02:25;02:27;"Last weekend was DC, and then two weekends before that,"
02:27;02:30;"Memorial Day weekend, was Minneapolis."
02:30;02:32;"You came in today wearing a T-shirt,"
02:32;02:34;"which I believe is from the same Minnesota trip"
02:34;02:36;"that you were just waiting for."
02:36;02:38;"It says ""Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar."""
02:38;02:41;"It looks kind of like an early '70s logo."
02:41;02:45;"There's an anthropomorphized female cookie,"
02:45;02:48;"or at least-- we don't know if the cookie's female,"
02:48;02:50;"- but this cookie-- - No, definitely a female cookie."
02:50;02:52;"Well, it's probably what they wanted to imply."
02:52;02:54;"The cookie has kind of, like, lipstick on and high heels,"
02:54;02:56;"- but, you know-- - Eyelashes."
02:56;02:58;"They're going for, like, a Minnie Mouse look on this cookie."
02:58;03:01;"What is Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar?"
03:01;03:04;"Okay, well, this is something I learned about on my trip to Minnesota."
03:04;03:09;"The Minnesota State Fair occurs the final two weeks of August of every year,"
03:09;03:12;"and it's the second largest state fair in the country,"
03:12;03:14;"so it's a big deal."
03:14;03:17;"Like, a family friend of Hannah's"
03:17;03:21;"runs this business called Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar,"
03:21;03:26;"and so at the fairgrounds, there's a giant cookie stand"
03:26;03:28;"that sells cookies in buckets."
03:28;03:33;"So, like, you buy, like, four dozen chocolate chip cookies in a bucket"
03:33;03:36;"- for, like, $17 or something. - So you can't buy a single cookie?"
03:36;03:38;"- I think you can, but here's the thing. - Yeah."
03:38;03:41;"It's a very popular item at the fair,"
03:41;03:43;"and people wait in line for hours."
03:43;03:49;"And I saw aerial photographs of zombie hordes"
03:49;03:51;"trying to get to the cookie stand."
03:51;03:54;"People wait in line at the Minnesota State Fair to get--"
03:54;03:58;"Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar chocolate chip cookies. That's all they sell."
03:58;04:01;"Because Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar, there's no brick-and-mortar retail establishment?"
04:01;04:04;"Nope. They sell this cookie-- Okay, they sell these cookies"
04:04;04:10;"only 12 days a year at the Minnesota State Fair,"
04:10;04:14;"and this operation is so successful and legendary within the state of Minnesota"
04:14;04:16;"that that's their yearly income."
04:16;04:17;"- That's so crazy. - Yeah."
04:17;04:22;"They make a good living every year selling cookies 12 days a year."
04:22;04:27;"Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar only exists at the Minnesota State Fair"
04:27;04:29;"once a year for 12 days."
04:29;04:31;"- They're covering their yearly income. - Yep."
04:31;04:34;"Colin just showed me an article on his phone,"
04:34;04:36;"and I didn't want to speculate on their income"
04:36;04:38;"because I knew the business did well."
04:38;04:41;"But this article the Hebrews brought up said that they make $3 million annually"
04:41;04:46;"selling cookies. Now, I know that they have 600 employees working the fair."
04:46;04:49;"- I don't know what their overhead is. - But that's for 12 days."
04:49;04:54;"- That's insane. - They're probably paying college students $7.50 an hour."
04:54;04:58;"So I know people that-- Oh, this dude Sean that I met,"
04:58;05:00;"his girlfriend--"
05:00;05:02;"- Had worked at the fair? - No, no, no."
05:02;05:04;"His girlfriend's mom is Martha."
05:04;05:05;"- Is Sweet Martha-- - Sorry to cut to the chase."
05:05;05:08;"- Wait, so did you meet Sweet Martha? - Oh, yeah. I went out-- Okay."
05:08;05:11;"Okay. Full disclosure. I went out to their lake house."
05:11;05:13;"- You went to Sweet Martha's lake house? - Yes, I did."
05:13;05:15;"That's where I met her and her husband."
05:15;05:18;"- I mean, it must have been a sick lake house. - Yeah, it was amazing."
05:18;05:20;"- Yeah. - And then we just rolled in blind."
05:20;05:23;"I didn't know anything. I didn't know anyone there."
05:23;05:26;"- Just eating caviar for breakfast. - Yeah, exactly."
05:26;05:30;"Slowly this story emerges about Sweet Martha's and the cookies."
05:30;05:33;"And I'm like, ""Okay, they have a cookie franchise."
05:33;05:37;"I'm sure they have outlets, locations, and various strip malls"
05:37;05:40;"around the greater Twin Cities."""
05:40;05:43;"Not the case. 12 days a year."
05:43;05:46;"- And so-- And actually-- Okay. - Dad's like,"
05:46;05:49;"""Jake, have you ever seen $3 million in cash?"""
05:49;05:51;"Like, ""No, sir."" Like, come down to the basement."
05:51;05:54;"- Yeah, seriously. - This is still from 2012."
05:54;05:57;"I haven't even had time to deposit this."
05:57;05:59;"Okay, well, check this out, dude."
05:59;06:03;"So there's the 12 days a year, but if there's a big event"
06:03;06:07;"at the Minnesota State Fairgrounds, they will open up for a day."
06:07;06:11;"Now, the Saturday that we were there for the wedding,"
06:11;06:15;"during the day, there was a hip-hop festival curated by this guy, Atmosphere,"
06:15;06:18;"who's like a local Minnesota rapper."
06:18;06:20;"And he had put together a big hip-hop festival,"
06:20;06:23;"and so Sweet Martha's was open for the afternoon."
06:23;06:27;"So we went over to the fairgrounds and got a tour of the full facilities."
06:27;06:30;"- Is it a permanent structure? - Oh, yeah."
06:30;06:32;"- Major, major infrastructure. - You know what?"
06:32;06:35;"- Major investment went into this. - It's like the Venice Biennale."
06:35;06:37;"- Kind of. - 'Cause there they have, like,"
06:37;06:39;"- every country has their pavilion. - Sure."
06:39;06:42;"Which, you know, it's really every two years."
06:42;06:45;"So for the vast majority of the time, they build these big permanent structures"
06:45;06:47;"that I'm sure they do other stuff in between,"
06:47;06:50;"but really, it's there for every two years."
06:50;06:52;"- Yeah. - And this is every one year."
06:52;06:54;"So did you see a lot of, like, Atmosphere fans"
06:54;06:57;"schlepping around a giant bucket of cookies?"
06:57;06:59;"- Yep. - Just, like, in the crowd,"
06:59;07:03;"- everybody was holding it? - Yeah, everyone was hitting Sweet Martha's."
07:03;07:07;"According to Google, there's only 90 calories in a Sweet Martha's cookie."
07:07;07:10;"- Well, they're small. They're small. - Okay."
07:10;07:12;"- And did you-- So you ate one? - Oh, yeah."
07:12;07:15;"- Probably ate, like, six. - I mean, when in Rome."
07:15;07:18;"I wanted to make a song about where I'm from, you know?"
07:18;07:21;"Big up my hometown, my territory, my state"
07:21;07:24;"But I couldn't figure out much to brag about"
07:24;07:27;"Well, Prince lives here, we got 10,000 legs"
07:27;07:29;"But wait, the women are beautiful, to me they are"
07:29;07:32;"And we're not infested with pretentious movie stars"
07:32;07:35;"And it hit me, hit me, Minnesota is dope"
07:35;07:38;"If only simply, for not what we have, but what we don't"
07:38;07:41;"It's all there, it ain't out there, it's in there"
07:41;07:44;"It's in the mirror, behind the breast, under the hair"
07:44;07:47;"Follow the dream, doesn't mean leave the love"
07:47;07:50;"Roam if you must, but come home when you've seen enough"
07:50;07:53;"I love New York and Cali, but I ain't moved"
07:53;07:56;"Too overpopulated, saturated with humans"
07:56;07:58;"And I'm not big on rappers, actors, or models"
07:58;08:01;"If I had to dip, I'd probably skip to Chicago"
08:01;08:04;"None of this is to diss no one, nowhere"
08:04;08:07;"Like damn, I'm from Minnesota, land of the cold air"
08:07;08:10;"Too many mosquitoes and a fair share of egos"
08:10;08:13;"But like my man Sabi says, that's where my money stands"
08:13;08:15;"So if the people laugh and giggle when you tell 'em where you live"
08:15;08:18;"Say, say"
08:18;08:21;"And if you know this is where you wanna raise your kids"
08:21;08:24;"Say, say"
08:24;08:27;"If you're from the Midwest and it doesn't matter where"
08:27;08:30;"Say, say"
08:30;08:33;"If you can drink tap water and breathe the air"
08:33;08:36;"Say, say"
08:36;08:38;"Got trees and vegetation in the city I stay"
08:38;08:42;"The rent's in the mail, and I can't always find a parking space"
08:42;08:44;"The women outnumber the men two to one"
08:44;08:47;"Got parks and zoos and things to do with my son"
08:47;08:50;"The nightlife ain't all that, but that's okay"
08:50;08:53;"I don't need to be distracted by the devil every day"
08:53;08:55;"And the jobs ain't really too hard to find"
08:55;08:59;"In fact, you could have mine if you knew how to rhyme"
08:59;09:01;"This is for everyone around the planet"
09:01;09:04;"That wishes they were from somewhere other than where they're standing"
09:04;09:07;"Don't take it for granted, instead, take a look around"
09:07;09:10;"Quit complaining and build something on that ground"
09:10;09:12;"Plant something on that ground, dance and sleep on that ground"
09:12;09:15;"Get on your hands and knees and watch the ants walk around the ground"
09:15;09:18;"Make a family, make magic, make a mess"
09:18;09:21;"Take the stress, fuel your motivation, and build your nest"
09:21;09:24;"It sucks that you think where I'm from is whack"
09:24;09:27;"But as long as that's enough to keep your ass from coming back"
09:27;09:29;"And with a smile and a hint of sarcasm, he said"
09:29;09:32;"I beg your pardon, but this is my secret garden"
09:32;09:33;"Alright"
09:33;09:41;"(Middle of the land of ice and snow)"
09:41;09:43;"(Middle of the land of ice and snow)"
09:43;09:47;"So if the people laugh and giggle when you tell 'em where you live, say"
09:47;09:49;"Say"
09:49;09:53;"If you know this is where you wanna raise your kids, say"
09:53;09:55;"Say"
09:55;09:59;"If you're from the Midwest and it doesn't matter where, say"
09:59;10:01;"Say"
10:01;10:05;"If you can drink tap water and breathe the air, say"
10:05;10:07;"Say"
10:07;10:11;"If the playground is clear of stems and syringes, say"
10:11;10:12;"Say"
10:12;10:16;"If there's only one store in your town that sells 12 inches, say"
10:16;10:18;"Say"
10:18;10:22;"If no one in your crew walks around with a gun, say"
10:22;10:24;"Say"
10:24;10:28;"And if you ain't gonna leave 'cause this is where you're from, say"
10:28;10:30;"Say"
10:30;10:33;"St. Cloud, Minnesota"
10:33;10:36;"Mankato, Minnesota"
10:36;10:39;"Duluth, Minnesota"
10:39;10:42;"Kansas City"
10:42;10:45;"St. Louis, Missouri"
10:45;10:48;"Columbia, Missouri"

11:08;11:11;"Sioux Falls, South Dakota"
11:11;11:13;"Ann Arbor, Michigan"
11:13;11:16;"Indianapolis, say"
11:16;11:20;"You know, I've always hated Otis Spunkmeyer. It's just one of those brands that rub me the wrong way."
11:20;11:25;"I think I've talked about this on the show. If I haven't, I'm glad we're talking about it now."
11:25;11:30;"I just remember being a kid, and at my school, they had grandma's cookies."
11:30;11:32;"Grandma's sucks too."
11:32;11:37;"Yeah, those suck too. But then they would have these greasy, hot Otis Spunkmeyer cookies."
11:37;11:41;"I always just felt like I don't like the name Otis Spunkmeyer. I think that that's..."
11:41;11:43;"That's a terrible name."
11:43;11:47;"And I'm not even saying because of that. I just don't like it."
11:47;11:50;"And I don't like how greasy they are."
11:50;11:54;"I don't know. There's something about having your full name, first and last name, on the cookie."
11:54;11:57;"I'm down with Sweet Martha's, but it should be Grandpa Spunkmeyer."
11:57;11:59;"Otis Spunkmeyer, it's arrogant."
11:59;12:02;"So I've always disliked Otis Spunkmeyer, but I just want to say that"
12:02;12:07;"Mr. Spunkmeyer, you spend all year trying to get into schools"
12:07;12:10;"and selling these gross cookies at the mall."
12:10;12:12;"I just want to say Sweet Martha's mops the floor with you."
12:12;12:16;"Sweet Martha's cleaning up three million in twelve days."
12:16;12:23;"In November 2006, the company was sold to IAWS Group for 561 million."
12:23;12:25;"That's how much Otis Spunkmeyer went for?"
12:25;12:30;"IAWS already owned Cuisine de France and La Brea Bakery"
12:30;12:35;"and merged with High Stand to form Azerta in 2008."
12:35;12:40;"Yeah, so you really want your cookie coming from an international conglomerate"
12:40;12:43;"that sounds like a cholesterol medication?"
12:43;12:45;"Yeah, like a pharmaceutical... Yeah, exactly."
12:45;12:46;"Azerta."
12:46;12:48;"Ask your doctor."
12:48;12:50;"Okay, well first of all, Azerta."
12:50;12:53;"561 million for Otis Spunkmeyer, you got ripped off."
12:53;12:55;"Yeah, you overpaid, dude. You overpaid like crazy."
12:55;12:57;"That's a Kushner move."
12:57;12:59;"Yeah."
12:59;13:01;"Jared Kushner definitely brokered that deal."
13:01;13:02;"That's like a half a billion."
13:02;13:06;"And I also want to say, Mr. Spunkmeyer, yeah, you got a big fat check,"
13:06;13:11;"but you know what? I'd rather be like some kind vibe Sweet Martha's thing."
13:11;13:16;"Just every 12 days, you rake in that check, and then the rest of the day you chill."
13:16;13:20;"Because it's like, would you really want to be a billionaire if it meant that every day"
13:20;13:23;"you're taking advantage of people?"
13:23;13:25;"You're waking up stressed out?"
13:25;13:29;"You know, forget-- like Sweet Martha's, that's the sweet spot of commerce."
13:29;13:35;"You made something, it's local, it's regional, people like it, you're getting paid great."
13:35;13:36;"You're a local legend."
13:36;13:38;"You don't need to franchise that out."
13:38;13:39;"No."
13:39;13:44;"If Sweet Martha and the gang spend the past 30 years building the brand,"
13:44;13:46;"they're like, we're opening one in Madison, Wisconsin."
13:46;13:48;"We're finally going to Chicago."
13:48;13:50;"She's down there all stressed out with the architect."
13:50;13:53;"Just like, oh my god, the Chicago and blah blah."
13:53;13:55;"Little by little, it's growing and growing."
13:55;13:58;"Then they get a chance to sell, and then they have to bring in all these finance dudes."
13:58;14:04;"And then finally, after 30 years of stressful stuff, getting in fights with Otis Spunkmeyer."
14:04;14:06;"What's the other one at the mall?"
14:06;14:07;"Mrs. Fields."
14:07;14:10;"You get in fights with Mrs. Fields, blah blah blah."
14:10;14:15;"And then finally, it's like you're 70, and you get that check for $561 million."
14:15;14:16;"And you're just like, cool."
14:16;14:18;"I could have been kicking it at the Lake House."
14:18;14:19;"Right."
14:19;14:20;"Great."
14:20;14:21;"Yeah, your kids are pissed off at you."
14:21;14:23;"Right."
14:23;14:27;"You know, the people that were OG Sweet Martha's fans are inundated."
14:27;14:29;"The stress of--"
14:29;14:32;"The quality of the product went down so far when they sold."
14:32;14:34;"The insane stress of when you first open--"
14:34;14:39;"When you're trying to open the one in Italy, and the local bakers revolted."
14:39;14:40;"Right, right."

17:07;17:09;"- So Jake, we got a hell of a show today."
17:09;17:10;"- Sweet."
17:10;17:13;"- Seinfeld 2000 helped us get a great guest."
17:13;17:15;"You wanna tell us about the guest, Seinfeld?"
17:15;17:18;"- Sure, her name is Kazzy David,"
17:18;17:20;"and she's the daughter of Larry David,"
17:20;17:23;"the creator of a TV show called ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"""
17:23;17:27;"the co-creator of another show called ""Seinfeld,"""
17:27;17:28;"which was a popular sitcom."
17:28;17:29;"- We're familiar."
17:29;17:32;"- Yeah, I know her kind of through Instagram."
17:32;17:33;"There was some direct messaging going on,"
17:33;17:35;"and then she seemed very on-brand"
17:35;17:37;"for this particular program,"
17:37;17:41;"and she's graciously agreed to join us."
17:41;17:42;"- You've been hooking us up"
17:42;17:45;"with a lot of great Seinfeld-adjacent content,"
17:45;17:46;"because the truth is,"
17:46;17:48;"nobody wants to hear us really talk about the show,"
17:48;17:51;"but you got us the composer of the Seinfeld theme."
17:51;17:51;"- That was great."
17:51;17:52;"- Yeah."
17:52;17:53;"- And now you have Kazzy David,"
17:53;17:55;"who not only is Larry David's daughter,"
17:55;17:58;"but she's also following in her father's footsteps now."
17:58;18:00;"- She has a web series called ""The 86th,"""
18:00;18:01;"and it's very funny."
18:01;18:04;"- It features her as Remy, a neurotic semi-narcissist"
18:04;18:06;"who, across several episodes ranging four to eight minutes,"
18:06;18:08;"tries to win her breakup."
18:08;18:09;"But social media and technology,"
18:09;18:10;"and again, her own neurosis,"
18:10;18:12;"keep thwarting every attempt."
18:12;18:14;"Very on-brand for ""Time Crisis."""
18:14;18:15;"So she's gonna be here soon."
18:15;18:18;"Jake, we got a real heartwarming show."
18:18;18:21;"A lot of ""Time Crisis"" is becoming kinda NPR."
18:21;18:24;"A real heartwarming story out of Belgium."
18:24;18:27;"- Oh, this actually ties in nicely with ""Sweet Martha's."""
18:27;18:28;"- So going back to ""Sweet Martha's,"""
18:28;18:29;"and we're talking about,"
18:29;18:33;"on ""Time Crisis,"" we don't necessarily have an ethos,"
18:33;18:37;"but more or less, we really turn a critical eye"
18:37;18:40;"on big corporate food."
18:40;18:41;"- Sure."
18:41;18:42;"- And we like small business."
18:42;18:44;"But we also have a critical eye on small business,"
18:44;18:47;"but similar to ""Sweet Martha's"" cookie jar,"
18:47;18:49;"which has built its own regional brand,"
18:49;18:52;"despite the disgusting harassment"
18:52;18:55;"of Otis Spunkmeyer and Mrs. Fields."
18:55;18:57;"- And the Grandma's Corporation."
18:57;18:59;"- We got a great email from Belgium."
18:59;19:01;"I wanna read it."
19:01;19:01;"""Hi, Jake."
19:01;19:02;"""My name is Celine."
19:02;19:04;"""I'm a Belgian TC fan."
19:04;19:06;"""I love the show and your paintings."""
19:06;19:07;"- Woo! - Nice."
19:07;19:09;"""I wanted to write you because I just read this article"
19:09;19:12;"""in the Belgian newspaper De Morgan"
19:12;19:15;"""about how Wendy's is prevented from expanding to Belgium"
19:15;19:18;"""and the Netherlands because one man is unwilling"
19:18;19:20;"""to change the name of his snack bar,"
19:20;19:22;"""which is also called Wendy's."
19:22;19:23;"""He named it after his daughter,"
19:23;19:26;"""just like the founder of the American Wendy's."""
19:26;19:27;"She sends a picture of him."
19:27;19:29;"He looks like kind of an average Joe."
19:29;19:33;"There's literally a stain on his shirt in the picture."
19:33;19:34;"He's got a little snack bar."
19:34;19:36;"Looks like they got sandwiches, fish and chips, fries."
19:36;19:39;"- It looks like it's in like an airport."
19:39;19:41;"- It's got kind of an airport vibe."
19:41;19:43;"So she says, ""This year, Dunkin' Donuts, Pizza Hut,"
19:43;19:45;"""Taco Bell, Five Guys and TGI Friday"
19:45;19:47;"""have all opened up branches in the Netherlands."
19:47;19:48;"""Obviously, Wendy's can't stay behind."""
19:48;19:51;"- Damn, all this year? - I know, brutal."
19:51;19:53;"""But apparently, they've been in a legal fight"
19:53;19:55;"""for almost 20 years now with a small town snack bar owner"
19:55;19:58;"""who owns the rights to the name Wendy's."
19:58;20:00;"""They might even be unable to expand to Europe at all"
20:00;20:03;"""because of the persistent snack bar owner."
20:03;20:06;"""In response, Wendy's hired the international law firm"
20:06;20:08;"""Hooghroekmanegger."
20:08;20:10;"""When confirmed with their lawyers,"
20:10;20:11;"""the snack bar owner said,"
20:11;20:13;"""'They look just like those CSI ladies."
20:13;20:14;"""'They look too perfect."
20:14;20:16;"""'Wendy's lost the lawsuit in February,"
20:16;20:18;"""'but they're appealing against it yet again.'"""
20:18;20:19;"This is a great email."
20:19;20:20;"Thank you so much, Celine."
20:20;20:24;"And it's nice to hear from a Belgian ""Time Crisis"" fan."
20:24;20:26;"""Time Crisis,"" we gotta take sides."
20:26;20:30;"I mean, Wendy's big corporation"
20:30;20:32;"versus the little Wendy's guy in Belgium?"
20:32;20:33;"Like, come on."
20:33;20:34;"- Yeah."
20:34;20:36;"I'm shocked that this is even an issue,"
20:36;20:39;"'cause he owns one snack bar."
20:39;20:41;"He doesn't own a chain of snack bars."
20:41;20:46;"Like, you could, like, I could open a sandwich place"
20:46;20:48;"on, like, Sunset and call it Wendy's."
20:48;20:49;"- No, I bet you couldn't."
20:49;20:49;"- I bet I could."
20:49;20:50;"- No, they wouldn't, no, man."
20:50;20:51;"- No, come on."
20:51;20:52;"- I'm surprised that you--"
20:52;20:56;"- If I call it Wendy's, okay,"
20:56;20:58;"his is Wendy's Fish and Chips."
20:58;21:00;"So what if mine was like Wendy's--"
21:00;21:02;"- Dude, these big corporations are psycho."
21:02;21:04;"- Sandwiches and wraps."
21:04;21:07;"- I bet we could open a cookie stand called Wendy's"
21:07;21:10;"on La Cienega, and Wendy's would sue us."
21:10;21:11;"They'd be like, ""We don't like,"
21:11;21:12;"""no, these companies are crazy."""
21:12;21:13;"- Really, 'cause Wendy's is like,"
21:13;21:16;"that's a name that's general enough"
21:16;21:17;"that other companies could use."
21:17;21:18;"Like, it's on McDonald's."
21:18;21:19;"- One would think."
21:19;21:21;"- And it's not, it's not even Arby's."
21:21;21:22;"- But even McDonald's."
21:22;21:26;"I bet if we opened a burger place called McDonald's"
21:26;21:26;"and we were like, ""You know what?"
21:26;21:28;"""It's just a great Scottish name,"""
21:28;21:29;"they would sue us like crazy."
21:29;21:30;"- Yeah, I believe that."
21:30;21:32;"- No, because corporations have this insane power"
21:32;21:34;"where they can, like, keep a name like that."
21:34;21:37;"So it's insane that, well, first of all,"
21:37;21:38;"I think it's cool."
21:38;21:42;"Like, why should Wendy's just get to go all over the world"
21:42;21:44;"and trample this guy's rights?"
21:44;21:45;"- Yeah, absolutely."
21:45;21:47;"- And they're coming with some big law firm."
21:47;21:49;"- I love that quote about the CSI ladies."
21:49;21:51;"- Yeah, and also, you know, there's country,"
21:51;21:54;"like Burger King in Australia is called Hungry Jacks."
21:54;21:55;"- Okay, so they do the--"
21:55;21:57;"- Copyright law is funny."
21:57;21:58;"- I hope this guy holds out."
21:58;22:00;"- Yeah, I mean, if we have anybody"
22:00;22:05;"in Belgium or Netherlands listening, please support."
22:05;22:06;"- Love to get him on the phone."
22:06;22:08;"- Yeah, yeah, oh, we should try to get him on."
22:08;22:09;"- That'd be great."
22:09;22:11;"- That'd be an interesting talk."
22:11;22:12;"- I also want to point out,"
22:12;22:15;"time crisis has always been harsh on Wendy's,"
22:15;22:18;"like the international corporation."
22:18;22:20;"They have that weird thing about how fresh they are."
22:20;22:21;"- Right."
22:21;22:23;"- Also, really, Wendy's, like,"
22:23;22:25;"how many locations do you think Wendy's has globally?"
22:25;22:26;"It's thousands."
22:26;22:27;"- Hold on."
22:27;22:29;"- You're gonna guess."
22:29;22:31;"- I'm gonna say, like, around 10,000."
22:31;22:35;"- That's, I was gonna say, like, 2,500."
22:35;22:36;"- No, no, way more than that."
22:36;22:37;"- Really?"
22:37;22:38;"- I mean, McDonald's is like 30,000 locations."
22:38;22:40;"- I know, but McDonald's is, like, insane."
22:40;22:42;"- But Wendy's is no joke, dude."
22:42;22:45;"- Can we get a number crunch on that?"
22:45;22:46;"- 6,100."
22:46;22:47;"- Okay."
22:47;22:48;"- Split the difference."
22:48;22:49;"- Split the difference."
22:49;22:49;"Okay, so I'm just saying,"
22:49;22:52;"you have 6,100 Wendy's in the world."
22:52;22:54;"You really need it in Netherlands and Belgium?"
22:54;22:57;"Just chill, take the L."
22:57;22:58;"In fact, I'm boycotting Wendy's"
22:58;23:00;"until they leave this man alone."
23:00;23:01;"- I like that."
23:01;23:03;"- Wendy's stay the hell out of the Flemish-speaking"
23:03;23:04;"part of the world."
23:04;23:07;"- There's already enough burgers there, as is."
23:07;23:08;"- Yeah, chill, Wendy's."
23:11;23:18;"- Time Crisis on Beat One."

24:53;24:55;"Where'd you grow up, LA?"
24:55;24:57;"- I grew up in Brentwood, yeah."
24:57;24:58;"- Oh, nice."
24:58;25:02;"- A very enclosed childhood."
25:02;25:03;"- What year were you born?"
25:03;25:04;"- 1994."
25:04;25:06;"- Ooh, Brentwood '94."
25:06;25:07;"- Hot."
25:07;25:08;"- What was going on then?"
25:08;25:09;"- What, OJ Simpson, right?"
25:09;25:10;"- Brentwood '94."
25:10;25:11;"- OJ Simpson."
25:11;25:12;"- When was OJ?"
25:12;25:13;"- '94, bro."
25:13;25:14;"- That was '94."
25:14;25:18;"- Were you born before or after the murder?"
25:18;25:20;"- I know so little about this murder."
25:20;25:23;"I have no idea when I was born around that time."
25:23;25:26;"- Wait, what month were you born?"
25:26;25:27;"- May."
25:27;25:27;"I don't know when it was."
25:27;25:28;"- Just before the murders."
25:28;25:29;"- Yeah, you guys can figure that out."
25:29;25:32;"- The murders were in June of '94."
25:32;25:33;"- So your parents are at home in Brentwood."
25:33;25:34;"- Yeah, they have a month."
25:34;25:35;"- With their baby daughter."
25:35;25:36;"- Month old."
25:36;25:39;"- Flip on the TV, their next door neighbor"
25:39;25:42;"is ripping down the freeway in a Ford Bronco."
25:42;25:46;"And an earthquake the same year?"
25:46;25:46;"Wow."
25:46;25:48;"- And the riots years before that."
25:48;25:49;"- Yeah."
25:49;25:52;"- So what, is there a lot of--"
25:52;25:54;"- Talking early, mid '90s LA history at this point."
25:54;25:55;"- It was a crazy time."
25:55;25:57;"- Is there a lot of fast food out in Brentwood?"
25:57;25:59;"Obviously that's an affluent community."
25:59;26:01;"There's a lot of fancy restaurants."
26:01;26:02;"You got the Country Mart."
26:02;26:04;"- Yeah, the Country Mart's the (beep)"
26:04;26:07;"- They're not gonna have a Wendy's at the Country Mart."
26:07;26:09;"But, so what do you have out there?"
26:09;26:10;"There's like a soup plantation, right?"
26:10;26:12;"- There's a soup plantation."
26:12;26:14;"I think there might be like a Baja Fresh."
26:14;26:16;"- Is there like a main drag in Brentwood?"
26:16;26:19;"- Yeah, there's San Vicente, there's Montana,"
26:19;26:21;"but then you're getting into Santa Monica."
26:21;26:23;"- I don't know this area at all."
26:23;26:25;"- But I don't eat fast food."
26:25;26:26;"I have never had."
26:26;26:27;"- Never? - No."
26:27;26:28;"- Never? - No."
26:28;26:29;"- So no fast food?"
26:29;26:30;"- None."
26:30;26:31;"- I'm intrigued."
26:31;26:32;"- Well, so what about, how old are you now?"
26:32;26:34;"- I'm 23, it took me."
26:34;26:36;"- Have you been to Del Taco?"
26:36;26:36;"- No."
26:36;26:37;"- Have you been to Taco Bell?"
26:37;26:38;"- Wow, you grew up in Southern California?"
26:38;26:39;"- No."
26:39;26:40;"- In-N-Out?"
26:40;26:43;"- I had In-N-Out maybe twice."
26:43;26:45;"- Wow, McDonald's?"
26:45;26:46;"- No."
26:46;26:47;"- Not once?"
26:47;26:47;"- You've never had McDonald's in your life?"
26:47;26:49;"- I had fries like one time."
26:49;26:50;"- And they were somebody else's fries?"
26:50;26:51;"- Yeah."
26:51;26:52;"- Wow."
26:52;26:55;"Because I also feel like I grew up in kind of a crunchy,"
26:55;26:59;"health food oriented household, but I wanted it more."
26:59;27:01;"- It makes me feel so sick."
27:01;27:03;"- That's fair, good for you."
27:03;27:05;"- And my parents just terrified me about it."
27:05;27:08;"They just scared me so badly that I never want it."
27:08;27:10;"Yeah, I'm so scared to eat anything that's bad."
27:10;27:13;"- So do you remember feeling the draw to McDonald's?"
27:13;27:16;"Like your friends were hitting McDonald's in high school,"
27:16;27:17;"and you were just like,"
27:17;27:19;"""My parents scared the (beep) out of me."""
27:19;27:20;"- I think there was like one thing"
27:20;27:21;"that I was really jealous of,"
27:21;27:24;"and I would just like be so upset that I didn't have it,"
27:24;27:26;"and it was the frosting with the sprinkles"
27:26;27:28;"that you dip, dips, dip."
27:28;27:30;"- Oh yeah, fun dip? - Oh, that's nasty."
27:30;27:31;"- Those were good."
27:31;27:32;"- Right, and that's like pure sugar."
27:32;27:35;"- That was like, ""Please mom, get me these sticks."""
27:35;27:36;"- But when you're like a senior in high school at lunch,"
27:36;27:38;"and kids have cars, and they're like,"
27:38;27:39;"""We're going to McDonald's."""
27:39;27:41;"And you'd be like, ""Guys, my parents are gonna kill me."
27:41;27:43;"""I'm just gonna get high in the parking lot."""
27:43;27:45;"- Yeah, that was pretty much."
27:45;27:46;"- Or you were just like, ""I'm not interested."""
27:46;27:48;"- I was kind of like, ""You guys are gross."
27:48;27:50;"""You shouldn't be going to McDonald's."""
27:50;27:51;"- Look at you, God."
27:51;27:53;"- I'm grossed out by you."
27:53;27:54;"- That's advanced."
27:54;27:56;"- I don't need McDonald's to have fun."
27:56;27:58;"And honestly, I feel bad for you guys."

30:16;30:18;"- Love your web series."
30:18;30:22;"I did notice one thing that prominently in one episode,"
30:22;30:23;"there's ice cream."
30:23;30:24;"- Yeah."
30:24;30:25;"- So you could just go get ice cream."
30:25;30:27;"- I like ice cream."
30:27;30:29;"Ice cream I'll do, but the ice cream we got"
30:29;30:32;"is like very organic, which embarrassingly enough,"
30:32;30:35;"it's like the healthiest ice cream you can eat."
30:35;30:36;"- Well, what's it called?"
30:36;30:37;"- Sweet Rose."
30:37;30:38;"- They use some special sugar or something?"
30:38;30:41;"- No, it's like, it's regular sugar and dairy,"
30:41;30:44;"but it's like all their ingredients"
30:44;30:45;"are from like the farmer's market."
30:45;30:46;"- Right, local."
30:46;30:49;"- I'm so LA and annoying, so."
30:49;30:50;"- No, that's fine."
30:50;30:52;"Well, one thing that I liked about it,"
30:52;30:54;"the kind of like thing that you point out in that episode,"
30:54;30:55;"and I've thought about this before,"
30:55;31:00;"in this episode, your character gets ice cream on a cone"
31:00;31:03;"and the two people she's with get it in a cup"
31:03;31:05;"and she's going through a tough time in her life"
31:05;31:06;"and she's saying like,"
31:06;31:07;"""You guys couldn't have just gotten a cone"
31:07;31:09;"in solidarity with me."""
31:09;31:10;"And I've thought about that a lot."
31:10;31:13;"It is funny, like when you go get ice cream with people,"
31:13;31:15;"'cause already in our culture,"
31:15;31:16;"we know that there's something shameful"
31:16;31:18;"about going to get ice cream."
31:18;31:19;"We know that we're doing something bad"
31:19;31:21;"when we go to get ice cream together."
31:21;31:22;"- Right."
31:22;31:23;"- And so it's a little bit--"
31:23;31:24;"- Bummer."
31:24;31:25;"- No, I'm just saying,"
31:25;31:28;"like we live in a very health conscious culture"
31:28;31:30;"where it's hard to just enjoy ice cream."
31:30;31:33;"Like we know we're being, that's how I feel."
31:33;31:35;"You know you're being bad, but it's kind of like,"
31:35;31:37;"so if you're going, the whole experience of ice cream"
31:37;31:39;"does involve getting a cone,"
31:39;31:41;"which you expertly pointed out."
31:41;31:43;"And it's funny if you like make a plan to get ice cream"
31:43;31:44;"and then you get the cone"
31:44;31:45;"and then somebody else just gets a cup."
31:45;31:46;"- Right."
31:46;31:48;"- It's a little bit like,"
31:48;31:49;"I thought we were gonna rob this bank together."
31:49;31:50;"- Right."
31:50;31:51;"- Yeah."
31:51;31:52;"- I think that's with so much stuff though,"
31:52;31:54;"'cause there's sometimes where you're out for dinner"
31:54;31:56;"with friends and you're like,"
31:56;31:58;"""Does anyone else wanna get a drink?"""
31:58;31:59;"And if they don't wanna get a drink,"
31:59;32:01;"you're like, ""Okay, thanks."
32:01;32:02;"I guess I won't get a drink."""
32:02;32:04;"But it's not their fault that you can't drink,"
32:04;32:06;"but it is at the same time."
32:06;32:07;"- Yeah, I just ignore that."
32:07;32:07;"I just get a drink."
32:07;32:09;"(both laughing)"
32:09;32:12;"- You know, it's also weird when people,"
32:12;32:15;"some people feel very strongly about"
32:15;32:17;"they don't wanna eat if the other person's not eating."
32:17;32:18;"- Right."
32:18;32:20;"That's a weird girl thing."
32:20;32:20;"Do you guys do that?"
32:20;32:21;"- Do you mean if the food comes before"
32:21;32:22;"the other food comes? - Some guys."
32:22;32:25;"- Or just like, ""I already had lunch, I'll sit with you."""
32:25;32:28;"- Yeah, because I feel like the whole thing is"
32:28;32:30;"we're just getting together to chop it up."
32:30;32:32;"We're just getting together to have a good time."
32:32;32:35;"Like, I don't know, so Jake, if you..."
32:35;32:36;"- Okay."
32:36;32:38;"- If you hit me up, if you were in my neighborhood,"
32:38;32:40;"and you said, ""Hey man, I'm in the hood."""
32:40;32:41;"- Starving."
32:41;32:42;"- Starving."
32:42;32:44;"Wanna crush a burrito with me."
32:44;32:47;"And I say, ""You know what, Jake?"
32:47;32:50;"I already cooked myself a nice organic stir fry at home,"
32:50;32:52;"but I'd love to come sit with you at the burrito place."""
32:52;32:54;"- Chipotle."
32:54;32:55;"- Yeah, Chipotle."
32:55;32:57;"Would you be like, ""Sweet, meet you there."""
32:57;33:00;"Or would you be like, ""Forget it."""
33:00;33:02;"- I'd probably be like, ""Forget it."""
33:02;33:03;"- Really?"
33:03;33:05;"- I'd wanna hang, but I wouldn't wanna like,"
33:05;33:09;"subject you to like, sitting at the Chipotle with me."
33:09;33:13;"I'm picturing the Chipotle on Beverly and La Brea."
33:13;33:14;"- Melrose and La Brea."
33:14;33:15;"- Okay, Mel, sorry."
33:15;33:17;"Melrose and La Brea, Chipotle."
33:17;33:19;"I'm like, ""Dude, I'm like 10 minutes out."
33:19;33:21;"Roll at me."
33:21;33:22;"Let's meet."
33:22;33:24;"I'm gonna sit down and eat a burrito in front of you."""
33:24;33:26;"- You don't want me to come to the Chipotle"
33:26;33:27;"'cause I already ate?"
33:27;33:28;"- It depends."
33:28;33:31;"Like, it's honestly like a really hard call."
33:33;33:36;"- I think it depends on like, what I'm dealing with."
33:36;33:38;"- I just wanna add one wrinkle to the equation."
33:38;33:40;"You're working that day."
33:40;33:42;"You're sweating it out on the job site all morning."
33:42;33:43;"- Okay."
33:43;33:45;"- You have 45 minutes for lunch."
33:45;33:46;"We haven't seen each other in a few weeks"
33:46;33:48;"'cause you've been at all these weddings."
33:48;33:50;"And then you hit me up."
33:50;33:53;"I got a tight 45 to leave the job site,"
33:53;33:54;"hit Chipotle and get back to the job site."
33:54;33:56;"- I love this job site."
33:56;33:59;"- Do you wanna link up?"
33:59;34:01;"And I say, ""Absolutely, man."
34:01;34:03;"I'd love to see you in Ketchup."""
34:03;34:07;"Although, I'll be honest, I did just go to Sweet Greens"
34:07;34:09;"and eat a kind of kale thing."
34:09;34:11;"- Kale Caesar."
34:11;34:14;"- Are you gonna literally just slam the door shut?"
34:14;34:16;"We're not gonna see each other otherwise."
34:16;34:17;"- I am."
34:17;34:18;"I'm gonna slam it."
34:18;34:19;"I'm gonna slam it."
34:19;34:20;"- Wow."
34:20;34:21;"- I know we're trying to get away from this,"
34:21;34:22;"but I actually thought of the example"
34:22;34:24;"that is better than yours."
34:24;34:25;"- Okay."
34:25;34:28;"- So you and your friend both have lunch together"
34:28;34:31;"and you get the same lunch, like the same amount of food."
34:31;34:33;"And then two hours later,"
34:33;34:36;"you're kind of in the mood for a snack."
34:36;34:38;"And you're like, ""I think we should get a snack."
34:38;34:39;"Don't you think?"""
34:39;34:42;"And they're like, ""No, I'm not really hungry."""
34:42;34:43;"- Ooh."
34:43;34:44;"- Okay."
34:44;34:46;"- Then you're like, ""That sucks."""
34:46;34:48;"- Because you guys are just spending all day together?"
34:48;34:51;"- Because you would feel like we had the same amount of food."
34:51;34:53;"Why am I hungry and you're not?"
34:53;34:54;"- Oh."
34:54;34:57;"So it's a full day hang."
34:57;34:59;"- Yeah, like why are we not both wanting a snack right now?"
34:59;35:02;"I mean, that's almost like a couple situation."
35:02;35:02;"- Maybe."
35:02;35:04;"- Like a couple, like, you know,"
35:04;35:05;"eat lunch with your girlfriend, it's the same thing."
35:05;35:06;"And then two hours later, you're just like."
35:06;35:09;"- Yeah, but in a couple, you know each other so well"
35:09;35:10;"that I don't know."
35:10;35:11;"- Okay, so there's less."
35:11;35:13;"- It's more of a competitive friend thing."
35:13;35:14;"- Right, right."
35:14;35:15;"- Yeah, in a couple, it's not gonna be."
35:15;35:16;"- Okay."
35:16;35:17;"- If you're with your girlfriend, you're like,"
35:17;35:18;"""I really could go for a Modelo."""
35:18;35:19;"She's gonna, ""Of course you can."""
35:19;35:20;"- Yeah, copy that."

37:17;37:22;"- So Kazzy, as we said earlier,"
37:22;37:25;"Seinfeld 2000 is what brought you to Time Crisis."
37:25;37:26;"So we have him on the mic."
37:26;37:27;"What's up, Seinfeld?"
37:27;37:28;"- Hey, what's up?"
37:28;37:34;"- So you guys met via Instagram DMs."
37:34;37:35;"- Yeah."
37:35;37:38;"The most millennial way to meet someone."
37:38;37:39;"- Extreme millennial."
37:39;37:40;"Slid into my DMs."
37:40;37:43;"- Which is probably why you thought I was 15, 14 years old."
37:43;37:44;"- Yeah, you were 16."
37:44;37:45;"- Seinfeld 2000 is a man."
37:45;37:47;"We won't say much beyond that."
37:47;37:48;"(laughing)"
37:48;37:49;"- He's a full grown man."
37:49;37:51;"- He's a full grown man."
37:51;37:51;"And tall."
37:51;37:53;"- Good looking too."
37:53;37:54;"- And handsome."
37:54;37:54;"- Oh, absolutely."
37:54;37:56;"- Okay, so this kind of begs the question,"
37:56;37:59;"obviously Seinfeld must have loomed large in your life"
37:59;38:01;"with your father being the co-creator."
38:01;38:03;"But is it a situation where people assume that,"
38:03;38:06;"wow, you must have grown up so in the mix with Seinfeld?"
38:06;38:08;"I guess by the time Seinfeld was off the air,"
38:08;38:09;"what, you four?"
38:09;38:11;"- Yeah, I was so young."
38:11;38:14;"I mean, there's like pictures of me as a baby"
38:14;38:15;"on the set and stuff,"
38:15;38:18;"but I don't remember anything because I was so little."
38:18;38:22;"But I didn't know the impact till I really went to college."
38:22;38:25;"- And people were like, whoa, that's your dad?"
38:25;38:27;"- Well, I went to basically like screenwriting school"
38:27;38:28;"for TV."
38:28;38:31;"So it was like in every class and I was like, whoa,"
38:31;38:32;"this is so weird."
38:32;38:34;"I guess I'm an idiot, but."
38:34;38:34;"- Wait, you did?"
38:34;38:36;"Wait, that's a thing when you're 18?"
38:36;38:37;"Could a?"
38:37;38:40;"- Well, Emerson has the major in screenwriting for TV."
38:40;38:41;"- Gotcha."
38:41;38:42;"- When it came up,"
38:42;38:44;"would kind of the whole class look at you kind of thing?"
38:44;38:46;"- I hoped most people didn't know about it,"
38:46;38:49;"but some people did and some people would look at me."
38:49;38:51;"But it was awkward."
38:51;38:53;"- I can imagine this situation would be."
38:53;38:54;"Is it awkward?"
38:54;38:56;"'Cause you know, Seinfeld 2000,"
38:56;38:58;"as a major Seinfeld enthusiast,"
38:58;39:00;"on the show many times,"
39:00;39:04;"another beloved 90s sitcom, ""Friends"" comes up"
39:04;39:05;"and I can see that."
39:05;39:06;"Yeah, exactly."
39:06;39:10;"- The way he, even just the word ""Friends"","
39:10;39:11;"he just bristles at it."
39:11;39:13;"He really dislikes it."
39:13;39:14;"He's agnostic on ""Frasier"","
39:14;39:16;"but ""Friends"" really bothers him."
39:16;39:18;"- That really makes me so happy though,"
39:18;39:19;"I have to tell you."
39:19;39:21;"Because there's a lot of people that don't even know"
39:21;39:23;"that it was a copy."
39:23;39:24;"- Yeah, I know."
39:24;39:26;"- There's people that aren't even aware of it."
39:26;39:27;"- Nah."
39:27;39:27;"- Wait, wait, wait."
39:27;39:28;"- It's really upsetting."
39:28;39:30;"- I think I might be one of these people."
39:30;39:32;"""Friends"" is a copy of ""Seinfeld""?"
39:32;39:34;"- How many shows were in a New York apartment"
39:34;39:35;"before ""Seinfeld""?"
39:35;39:36;"- I'll tell you."
39:36;39:38;"- Family, domestic situation."
39:38;39:38;"- ""Money Moaners""."
39:38;39:41;"- ""Friends"" wasn't the only one that copied it also."
39:41;39:42;"- Oh right, 'cause it wasn't a family show."
39:42;39:44;"- But there's so many factors to it."
39:44;39:48;"I mean, they could easily have just had Chandler and Joey"
39:48;39:51;"live a door down and it had to be like right across."
39:51;39:52;"Like that's the exact same."
39:52;39:54;"I mean, there's actual shots,"
39:54;39:57;"like cinematic shots that were taken."
39:57;40:00;"So it goes so far, but I'm like so passionate about it"
40:00;40:02;"because I can't really talk about it"
40:02;40:05;"'cause people are like, ""Okay, 'cause yeah."""
40:05;40:07;"- Right, but you feel like you looked at this,"
40:07;40:09;"you looked at the evidence dispassionately"
40:09;40:12;"and you realize that this is the case."
40:12;40:14;"- It couldn't be more obvious."
40:14;40:16;"- I feel like tonally, they're worlds apart."
40:16;40:18;"I mean, yes, they're both set in New York"
40:18;40:19;"with people in their apartments."
40:19;40:22;"First of all, the ""Friends"" people are in their 20s."
40:22;40:26;"The ""Seinfeld"" characters are in their late 20s, 30s."
40:26;40:27;"- See a massive difference."
40:27;40:28;"- No, no, no, no, no, no."
40:28;40:29;"Not to split hairs, not splitting hairs."
40:29;40:32;"Totally couldn't be farther apart."
40:32;40:33;"""Friends"" is sincere."
40:33;40:35;"- I mean, you're not gonna be able to write the same way."
40:35;40:37;"That would be impossible."
40:37;40:38;"But I mean, I think they were like,"
40:38;40:40;"""Oh, that show did really well."
40:40;40:42;"""Let's make the exact same plot,"
40:42;40:43;"""but we'll be writing it."""
40:43;40:45;"So it'll be, I mean, that's not,"
40:45;40:47;"I don't know if that's exactly what they thought,"
40:47;40:48;"but it's like- - Who created ""Friends""?"
40:48;40:52;"- Someone named Marty Kaufman and then two other people."
40:52;40:53;"Crane, I remember seeing in a credit."
40:53;40:55;"I love ""Friends,"" by the way."
40:55;40:55;"I watch ""Friends"" all the time."
40:55;40:56;"- Okay, you're not mad at it."
40:56;40:57;"Okay, that's important to point out."
40:57;41:00;"- I watch it all the time, but I know it copied."
41:00;41:02;"- Is there a Kazzy Kaufman?"
41:03;41:04;"Have you guys ever crossed paths?"
41:04;41:07;"(all laughing)"
41:07;41:09;"- No, that would be very funny."
41:09;41:11;"- So ""Seinfeld 2000,"""
41:11;41:14;"maybe some ""Time Crisis"" listeners"
41:14;41:16;"might primarily know you"
41:16;41:18;"as you're the person who runs ""Time Crisis 2000,"""
41:18;41:20;"the account, you have your Twitter account,"
41:20;41:21;"but more than ever,"
41:21;41:23;"you have this thriving Instagram account."
41:23;41:25;"- Yeah, it's booming, for sure."
41:25;41:28;"- And before you came on board"
41:28;41:32;"as one of a beloved member of the team,"
41:32;41:33;"back when you and I were kind of more,"
41:33;41:35;"I guess, what you'd call frenemies,"
41:35;41:38;"you were this wild Twitter account that I really liked."
41:38;41:39;"And we've had our ups and downs,"
41:39;41:41;"but we kind of ended up in a good place."
41:41;41:41;"And at this point,"
41:41;41:45;"not only do I consider our beef squashed,"
41:45;41:49;"I really, I feel defensive of you and ""Seinfeld 2000."""
41:49;41:52;"I've noticed because Instagram,"
41:52;41:55;"just one more way that the social media"
41:55;41:56;"can toy with our emotions,"
41:56;42:00;"they've gotten the explore column on Instagram,"
42:00;42:03;"whatever they did to the algorithm, it's bananas."
42:03;42:05;"I'm trying to pay attention to something."
42:05;42:07;"I'm like, ""Let me close this (beep)."""
42:07;42:09;"And then it's literally, I've got it open again,"
42:09;42:10;"and I have no memory of opening it again."
42:10;42:11;"You ever have that experience?"
42:11;42:14;"You close Instagram, and you're looking at it again?"
42:14;42:17;"And increasingly, I don't even look at my feed,"
42:17;42:18;"so I don't even look at what's happening"
42:18;42:19;"with my friends and loved ones."
42:19;42:21;"I'm just looking at this,"
42:21;42:22;"do I interact with accounts similar to this one?"
42:22;42:23;"So I'll show you this one."
42:23;42:25;"So anyway. - I never look at that."
42:25;42:26;"- Don't look, man. - Yeah."
42:26;42:27;"- It's gonna suck you in. - You'll never be able to stop."
42:27;42:28;"- Jeez, all right."
42:28;42:30;"- Because I follow ""Seinfeld 2000,"""
42:30;42:32;"I'm getting all these ""Seinfeld"" accounts,"
42:32;42:34;"and increasingly, I'm looking at some of them,"
42:34;42:36;"and I'm like, ""Is this 'Seinfeld 2000'?"""
42:36;42:38;"'Cause it's this whole booming industry,"
42:38;42:40;"and I feel like you're the OG."
42:40;42:41;"- Yes. - Is it fair to say"
42:41;42:43;"that you're the first person"
42:43;42:45;"who ever took an image from the news"
42:45;42:47;"and then did a slow zoom"
42:47;42:50;"and played the ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" music?"
42:50;42:52;"- Well, here's the thing about that."
42:52;42:53;"You know when you can have an idea,"
42:53;42:55;"and you think it's an independent idea,"
42:55;42:57;"and then concurrently, there's been another idea?"
42:57;42:59;"- Like Edison and Tesla. - Yes."
42:59;43:01;"- Exactly, or-- - ""Seinfeld"" is French."
43:01;43:02;"- To quote, right? - Maybe."
43:02;43:04;"- It's Ziggy."
43:04;43:05;"People have pointed out to me"
43:05;43:09;"that this apparently was a thing called the ""frolic effect"""
43:09;43:11;"that was a thing on YouTube."
43:11;43:13;"But as far as I'm concerned,"
43:13;43:14;"I kinda took it to another level."
43:14;43:18;"- If you thought of it yourself, you got the credit for it."
43:18;43:20;"- And I feel like he brought it to Twitter"
43:20;43:21;"and to Instagram. - True."
43:21;43:23;"- Like you did the first Chris Christie one"
43:23;43:25;"standing next to Trump, right? - Yes."
43:25;43:25;"- Yeah. - That's hilarious."
43:25;43:29;"- That was a pivotal moment in that meme."
43:29;43:30;"- ""Seinfeld 2000"" is so cool, by the way,"
43:30;43:33;"'cause it actually isn't just like repeating memes."
43:33;43:35;"Like it's original."
43:35;43:36;"It's an original concept."
43:36;43:39;"- And sometimes people think that these memes are repeated,"
43:39;43:40;"or, ""Oh, you took that from me?"""
43:40;43:42;"No, it's all stuff that I come up with."
43:42;43:43;"I try to be original."
43:43;43:45;"So thank you for recognizing that."
43:45;43:47;"- I have to ask what your guys' beef was about, though,"
43:47;43:49;"'cause that was like a quick mention."
43:49;43:50;"- Oh, yeah. - I'm so curious."
43:50;43:52;"- That's true, and sometimes ""Crisis"" listeners,"
43:52;43:55;"depending when they got on board, might not remember."
43:55;43:58;"And maybe you can chime in here."
43:58;44:02;"This guy, for years, has this deeply held belief"
44:02;44:04;"that ""Seinfeld"" could come back on TV."
44:04;44:06;"He started out guessing about what ""Seinfeld"""
44:06;44:08;"would be like if it was on TV,"
44:08;44:10;"and then eventually a corner was turned"
44:10;44:12;"where he wasn't just saying,"
44:12;44:15;"imagining a modern ""Seinfeld."""
44:15;44:17;"He truly started to believe that it might happen."
44:17;44:20;"And I just think there's no evidence to support that."
44:20;44:21;"And I would sometimes say to him,"
44:21;44:22;"""You know, this is a pipe dream."""
44:22;44:23;"And the way he would react,"
44:23;44:26;"it would be as if I told him"
44:26;44:27;"that Donald Trump wasn't president."
44:27;44:28;"- Right. - You know, he'd act like--"
44:28;44:29;"- Or it's like a 9/11 conspiracy."
44:29;44:32;"- Did we ever think that Donald Trump would be president?"
44:32;44:34;"No, and yet here we are."
44:34;44:35;"- That's a very good argument."
44:35;44:38;"- Okay, I picked a terrible example."
44:38;44:40;"Okay, but my point is that the way"
44:40;44:44;"that you would talk about it made me feel unheard."
44:44;44:46;"And the way that you jumped down my throat about it--"
44:46;44:47;"- That is so funny."
44:47;44:50;"- You jumped down my throat about it, and I just--"
44:50;44:52;"- Guys, guys, you know, we're cool now,"
44:52;44:53;"and that's really all that matters."

47:47;47:49;"- With Ezra Keenan."
47:49;47:50;"- Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
47:50;47:52;"- Peace one."
47:52;47:53;"- I have another question. - Yeah."
47:53;47:55;"- You kind of have an accent."
47:55;47:55;"- I have an accent?"
47:55;47:57;"- Yeah, where are you from?"
47:57;47:59;"- Okay, this is interesting because my whole life"
47:59;48:03;"people have said to me that I have an accent."
48:03;48:04;"So I was born in New York,"
48:04;48:07;"but I grew up in New Jersey, Northern New Jersey."
48:07;48:10;"So my entire life I've been in the Northern New Jersey,"
48:10;48:11;"New York. - That's not the accent."
48:11;48:13;"- Metro area. - I think that wasn't it."
48:13;48:15;"- I remember being in high school,"
48:15;48:18;"and I think I went on a trip with a band trip,"
48:18;48:23;"and we were with another regional New Jersey"
48:23;48:25;"high school band, and we were like in a hotel."
48:25;48:26;"And I remember-- - Band."
48:26;48:28;"- You have an accent."
48:28;48:29;"Band, band."
48:29;48:31;"- I think it's unique to Ezra."
48:31;48:33;"- It's cool, no, I really like it."
48:33;48:33;"I was just wondering if it's from somewhere."
48:33;48:35;"- I don't know, I've thought about it a lot."
48:35;48:37;"Like my parents, I think,"
48:37;48:40;"wait Jake, have you chatted with my parents before?"
48:40;48:41;"- I don't think so."
48:41;48:44;"- Like my dad's from the Bronx, my mom grew up in Jersey."
48:44;48:45;"My thing, my friends think of them"
48:45;48:48;"as having New York accents, kind of."
48:48;48:49;"But you don't hear this as a New York,"
48:49;48:51;"New Jersey accent. - My first thought"
48:51;48:54;"was that you might have been maybe a little Norwegian."
48:54;48:56;"- Whoa, wow, didn't see that coming."
48:56;48:57;"- Just a little. - Deep."
48:57;48:59;"- Like slightly."
48:59;49:00;"- Like not American."
49:00;49:04;"- No, I mean yes, but you have a little ting."
49:04;49:07;"- What's like the Brentwood accent?"
49:07;49:10;"- You know, I was talking about this with someone recently,"
49:10;49:13;"like where accents originate,"
49:13;49:15;"and everyone was just like, oh yeah,"
49:15;49:18;"like California's the only one without an accent."
49:18;49:21;"But that's just because other people have different accents."
49:21;49:22;"So I guess it is an accent."
49:22;49:24;"- I'm trying to imagine, if I just heard your voice,"
49:24;49:25;"didn't know anything about you,"
49:25;49:27;"would I think this is California?"
49:27;49:28;"You know what's funny about Jake?"
49:28;49:30;"Jake was born and raised in Connecticut,"
49:30;49:31;"John Mayer's home state."
49:31;49:36;"And I feel like Jake spent so much time on the West Coast,"
49:36;49:38;"'cause he went to college in Portland,"
49:38;49:40;"lived in SF for a while, LA,"
49:40;49:43;"that Jake, and Jake's whole vibe is so West Coast"
49:43;49:47;"that I feel like your cadence and your language is very,"
49:47;49:50;"maybe not LA, but certainly West Coast."
49:50;49:52;"But that might be more vocabulary."
49:52;49:53;"- Yeah, I don't know."
49:53;49:55;"- At your school, would people use the phrase"
49:55;49:56;"crush a burrito?"
49:56;49:58;"- No."
49:58;49:58;"- Gnarly?"
49:58;50:00;"Did they say buff?"
50:00;50:03;"- They said some gnarly, I guess."
50:03;50:03;"- Oh, gnarly, really?"
50:03;50:07;"- I feel like my lingo is just based on my group of friends."
50:07;50:08;"Groups of friends form their own"
50:08;50:11;"sort of like linguistic ecosystems."
50:11;50:12;"- True."
50:12;50:13;"- And I'm just sort of like, I don't know,"
50:13;50:15;"yeah, just like catch phrases or slang"
50:15;50:16;"just thrown around."
50:16;50:17;"- No, and definitely, you've rubbed off on me."
50:17;50:19;"I was doing an interview recently,"
50:19;50:21;"and I did describe something as gnarly."
50:21;50:24;"I was like, would I have said that a few years ago"
50:24;50:25;"when I was in--"
50:25;50:26;"- That warms my heart."
50:26;50:26;"- Yeah."
50:26;50:28;"Gnarly comes up."
50:28;50:30;"- It's a buff traffic sitch."
50:30;50:33;"- Yeah, are you familiar with the phrase buff traffic sitch?"
50:33;50:35;"- No, I've never heard buff before."
50:35;50:36;"- You don't know buff?"
50:36;50:37;"- No."
50:37;50:40;"- Buff is super, like, I'm not a surfer,"
50:40;50:42;"but I have a lot of friends that are surfers."
50:42;50:44;"- Yeah, you actually do sound like a surfer."
50:44;50:45;"- Really?"
50:45;50:47;"- So you've definitely gotten that from your friends."
50:47;50:48;"- I'm terrified."
50:48;50:49;"I went out a few times on the board,"
50:49;50:51;"and it was just, I couldn't deal with it."
50:51;50:53;"Like, kind of a buffy break today."
50:53;50:55;"- I like it, I really like it."
50:55;50:59;"- Buff just means like rough, scary, messed up."
50:59;51:00;"- So it could mean everything."
51:00;51:02;"- You can apply it to other situations besides the surf."
51:02;51:05;"It's just like, this traffic is buff right now."
51:05;51:08;"- The words that mean, that could mean anything,"
51:08;51:11;"it's just like, why are we even talking, you know?"
51:11;51:13;"- Could mean anything, well, but it means something."
51:13;51:14;"I mean."
51:14;51:15;"- No, that mean everything."
51:15;51:16;"- That mean everything."
51:16;51:17;"- Yeah."
51:17;51:18;"- I picked a brutal from you."
51:18;51:20;"I call everything brutal now."
51:20;51:21;"Just like."
51:21;51:22;"- So brutal, bro."
51:22;51:24;"- Yeah, when you don't have anything else to say,"
51:24;51:25;"and somebody's just like, oh my god,"
51:25;51:28;"of all things, like, brutal."
51:28;51:29;"I definitely say that a lot."
51:29;51:32;"And then also, you know, I got another friend"
51:32;51:33;"who rubs off on me a lot,"
51:33;51:34;"and he's kind of like,"
51:34;51:36;"comes from like, 90s hip hop background,"
51:36;51:38;"so I always call stuff ill."
51:38;51:39;"- Okay."
51:39;51:40;"- And I'm like, I wonder if I should pump"
51:40;51:41;"the brakes on that one."
51:41;51:45;"- Sick, I would say is a little less annoying than ill."
51:45;51:46;"- Like that's sick?"
51:46;51:47;"- Yeah."
51:47;51:48;"- I definitely say sick."
51:48;51:48;"- I say sick too."
51:48;51:49;"- You have some good ones, Ezra."
51:49;51:50;"You have chop it up."
51:50;51:51;"- Oh, chop it up."
51:51;51:52;"- What does that mean?"
51:52;51:53;"- Which I never use."
51:53;51:53;"- That just means to talk."
51:53;51:55;"- I like it, or hang out."
51:55;51:57;"- Yeah, like, or, yeah."
51:57;51:59;"- I don't think hang out is Ezra's."
51:59;51:59;"(laughing)"
51:59;52:01;"- Chop it up."
52:01;52:01;"- Chop, chop it up."
52:01;52:03;"- Oh, it means hang out, okay."
52:03;52:05;"- In Norway, we say hang out."
52:05;52:06;"- Yeah, yeah."
52:06;52:07;"- I know it sounds wacky."
52:07;52:10;"- It just means hanging out with your friends."
52:10;52:11;"(laughing)"
52:24;52:49;"- Okay, back to Seinfeld."
52:49;52:51;"We have Seinfeld 2000,"
52:51;52:53;"one of the premier Seinfeld accounts."
52:53;52:54;"And I just also want to say,"
52:54;52:56;"fuck all the other accounts who give this guy grief."
52:56;52:57;"- Right."
52:57;52:57;"- He's the OG."
52:57;52:58;"- Thank you."
52:58;52:59;"- OG."
52:59;53:00;"- We got Kazzy, who obviously has a family connection"
53:00;53:01;"to the program."
53:01;53:02;"And then we just got--"
53:02;53:03;"- But knows nothing."
53:03;53:04;"- That means nothing."
53:04;53:05;"And then we got me and Jake,"
53:05;53:08;"who are just two chill bros who are familiar with the show."
53:08;53:09;"- Fans of the show."
53:09;53:11;"- Fans of the show, having grown up in America."
53:11;53:12;"- Not heads."
53:12;53:12;"- In America."
53:12;53:13;"Yeah, I wouldn't say a head."
53:13;53:14;"- What does that mean?"
53:14;53:15;"Is that a crew?"
53:15;53:16;"- Oh, head?"
53:16;53:17;"- Yeah."
53:17;53:19;"- Like a massive fan."
53:19;53:19;"- Okay."
53:19;53:20;"- Like a dead head."
53:20;53:21;"- That's a good one."
53:21;53:22;"- Yeah, yeah."
53:22;53:23;"- I like Seinfeld, but I'm not a head."
53:23;53:24;"(laughing)"
53:24;53:25;"Like this--"
53:25;53:28;"- I've probably seen like 80% of the episodes."
53:28;53:29;"- You haven't seen all the episodes?"
53:29;53:30;"- I haven't seen--"
53:30;53:31;"- You know what?"
53:31;53:32;"I haven't either."
53:32;53:32;"- Never seen the finale."
53:32;53:33;"- Yeah."
53:33;53:34;"- Never seen the finale."
53:34;53:35;"- Oh, I watched that live."
53:35;53:36;"- Yeah, me too."
53:36;53:38;"- Well, look at you guys."
53:38;53:39;"- Maybe I am a head."
53:39;53:41;"Okay, so we got Nick Weidenfeld,"
53:41;53:42;"member of the TC crew, getting on the mic."
53:42;53:47;"He's going to run the Seinfeld game."
53:47;53:48;"How's this gonna work, Nick?"
53:48;53:52;"- All right, well, we have names for the teams."
53:52;53:53;"- Well, what are the teams?"
53:53;53:53;"Is it me and Jake versus--"
53:53;53:58;"- You and Jake versus Kazzy and Seinfeld 2000,"
53:58;54:00;"which on the surface,"
54:00;54:02;"that would seem like the winning team, right?"
54:02;54:05;"- Yeah, I'm very nervous about this"
54:05;54:07;"because I'm just not a trivia-minded person."
54:07;54:09;"My brain doesn't really work that way."
54:09;54:10;"- You're a head, dude."
54:10;54:12;"- I'm a head, but we'll see."
54:12;54:13;"We'll see what happens."
54:13;54:14;"- You'll be fine."
54:14;54:16;"I'm about to let down my entire family."
54:16;54:19;"- Seinfeld 2000 and Kazzy David,"
54:19;54:21;"you guys are the Yankees of this."
54:21;54:23;"Maybe you guys gotta be the Yankees."
54:23;54:24;"- The Yankees and the Mets, sure."
54:24;54:27;"- Yeah, I guess the Mets are like a scrappy underdog"
54:27;54:28;"compared to the Yankees."
54:28;54:29;"- I was gonna say like the Brewers."
54:29;54:31;"- Okay, we're the Brewers."
54:31;54:32;"- Twins."
54:32;54:33;"- The Yankees."
54:33;54:35;"We have the Yankees versus the Twins,"
54:35;54:38;"and the way the game's gonna be played is"
54:38;54:40;"each team's gonna get five questions."
54:40;54:42;"If you get it right, you're gonna hear this."
54:45;54:47;"If you get it wrong, you're gonna hear this."
54:47;54:50;"(toy horn)"
54:50;54:51;"- Love it."
54:51;54:54;"- If there's a tie at the end, there'll be a tiebreaker."
54:54;54:56;"And Leah, let's do a flip of the coin to see who goes first."
54:56;54:58;"Let's do a flip of the medallion."
54:58;55:00;"- The Twins will take the top of the cap."
55:00;55:03;"- It's the bottom of the cap."
55:03;55:04;"- It's the Yankees."
55:04;55:04;"- Yankees."
55:04;55:08;"So the first multiple choice question,"
55:08;55:14;"Yankees, what causes George's fiancee, Susan, to die?"
55:14;55:15;"- Oh my God."
55:15;55:17;"- Envelope, it was an envelope."
55:17;55:18;"- What a joke."
55:18;55:19;"(popping)"
55:19;55:20;"(laughing)"
55:20;55:22;"- I mean, we didn't even need the--"
55:22;55:24;"- Okay, that was a softball."
55:24;55:25;"Let's see what we get."
55:25;55:26;"- Twins."
55:26;55:27;"- Yeah."
55:27;55:29;"- What, in almost every episode,"
55:29;55:31;"is found on the shelf in Jerry's apartment?"
55:31;55:32;"- Cereal."
55:32;55:33;"(toy horn)"
55:33;55:34;"- Woo!"
55:34;55:36;"- All right, yeah, we don't need the multiple choice."
55:36;55:36;"- Wait, we got that wrong, or what?"
55:36;55:38;"- Wait, that was wrong."
55:38;55:39;"- Wait, oh, that was wrong?"
55:39;55:40;"(laughing)"
55:40;55:41;"- Can I take this one?"
55:41;55:42;"- Was that wrong?"
55:42;55:44;"- Wait, wait, that was wrong."
55:44;55:44;"(toy horn)"
55:44;55:45;"- Oh wow."
55:45;55:47;"- Do we get the question if they got it wrong?"
55:47;55:47;"- Bottled water?"
55:47;55:48;"- Oh."
55:48;55:49;"- What was it?"
55:49;55:50;"- Superman."
55:50;55:51;"- What?"
55:51;55:52;"(popping)"
55:52;55:53;"- All right, debatable, moving on."
55:53;55:54;"- Debatable."
55:54;55:56;"- Cereal was a great answer, it was a really good answer."
55:56;55:57;"- All right, thank you."
55:57;56:01;"- Yankees, what was, quote, ""Little Jerry""?"
56:01;56:03;"I know this one, do you know?"
56:03;56:04;"There's an animal?"
56:05;56:08;"It was, wasn't it a rooster?"
56:08;56:09;"(popping)"
56:09;56:11;"- That's right, Kramer's pet rooster."
56:11;56:12;"- Would you have known that?"
56:12;56:13;"- No."
56:13;56:16;"- What season is, do we know what season that is?"
56:16;56:19;"- I would have guessed like six?"
56:19;56:21;"- It seems like a, that's a late season."
56:21;56:23;"- Yeah, that's a late one."
56:23;56:24;"- That's like when Kramer has his head"
56:24;56:26;"on the turkey kind of situation."
56:26;56:27;"- Right, right, right."
56:27;56:29;"- All right, twins, back to you."
56:29;56:32;"- Okay, oh man, all right, we're gonna get our (beep)"
56:32;56:32;"together."
56:32;56:37;"- In the quote, ""Bubble Boy"", what game does George"
56:37;56:39;"and Bubble Boy fight about?"
56:39;56:41;"- Oh."
56:41;56:42;"- That's a good question."
56:44;56:44;"- Is it a board game?"
56:44;56:45;"- Probably a board game."
56:45;56:46;"- You mean multiple choice?"
56:46;56:47;"- Yeah."
56:47;56:50;"- You can ask for multiple choice from now on."
56:50;56:51;"- It's only a friend."
56:51;56:51;"- Yeah."
56:51;56:54;"- Okay, A, Monopoly."
56:54;56:55;"- That wasn't a move."
56:55;56:55;"- B, Uno."
56:55;56:58;"C, Trivial Pursuit."
56:58;57:00;"Or D, Go Fish."
57:00;57:03;"- They all seem possible."
57:03;57:04;"- Doesn't help."
57:04;57:04;"- Um."
57:04;57:09;"Trivial Pursuit?"
57:09;57:10;"- Oh yeah."
57:10;57:10;"- Nice, dude."
57:10;57:11;"- Wow."
57:11;57:15;"- I think we got in a fight about something trivial."
57:15;57:17;"That was my thinking on that one."
57:17;57:18;"- Well done."
57:18;57:19;"- Thank you."
57:19;57:21;"Back on the board."
57:21;57:24;"- Currently scored two to one, Yankees."
57:24;57:29;"So Yankees, what does Elaine buy a lot of for Mr. Pit"
57:29;57:33;"but doesn't get the right kind of?"
57:33;57:34;"- Mr. Pit."
57:34;57:35;"- Is it socks?"
57:35;57:38;"- Nice one."
57:38;57:39;"- It is socks."
57:39;57:40;"- Nice one, Kazzy."
57:40;57:42;"(laughing)"
57:42;57:44;"- All right, this is turning out about how one would expect."
57:44;57:45;"All right, you guys are doing well."
57:45;57:48;"- I thought these questions would be harder, to be honest."
57:48;57:49;"Anyway."
57:49;57:50;"- I didn't make up the questions."
57:50;57:50;"- That one was hard."
57:50;57:51;"I wouldn't have gotten that."
57:51;57:52;"- I wouldn't have."
57:52;57:54;"- Seinfeld 2000 is head, so."
57:54;57:55;"- Yeah."
57:55;57:59;"- I love how stressed Seinfeld was about these questions."
57:59;58:01;"- All right, twins."
58:01;58:07;"What kind of pasta does Kramer make a Jerry figurine from?"
58:07;58:08;"- Pusilli."
58:08;58:09;"- Pusilli?"
58:10;58:12;"- That is correct, it is Pusilli."
58:12;58:13;"- Clutch, dude."
58:13;58:16;"- All right, Yankees."
58:16;58:19;"What does Kramer have installed in his shower?"
58:19;58:24;"- Oh, that's a, is it a garbage disposal?"
58:24;58:24;"- It is."
58:24;58:26;"- Wow."
58:26;58:27;"- In his shower?"
58:27;58:28;"- It's a very funny episode."
58:28;58:31;"- It's an episode where he wants to eat in his shower."
58:31;58:32;"- Okay."
58:32;58:33;"- Is that the one where George Easton says--"
58:33;58:35;"- So he has a garbage disposal inside his shower"
58:35;58:36;"and I think--"
58:36;58:37;"- To save time, right?"
58:37;58:38;"- To save time."
58:38;58:40;"- You know what, actually, I haven't watched all of Seinfeld."
58:40;58:41;"Maybe I never."
58:41;58:44;"Next time we're doing Curb, 'cause I would shred it then."
58:44;58:45;"- Yeah, I would shred it that too."
58:45;58:46;"- I would shred it."
58:46;58:48;"- I haven't seen the last two seasons of Seinfeld."
58:48;58:50;"- Wow."
58:50;58:52;"- Maybe we'll, you know what, maybe that's what we'll do."
58:52;58:53;"- Well, there's not gonna be a bonus."
58:53;58:55;"- Oh, those are the weird seasons, though."
58:55;58:58;"The show kinda goes off the rails a little bit."
58:58;58:59;"- Out of familial pride, you were like,"
58:59;59:01;"""I don't need to watch these last two seasons."""
59:01;59:02;"- Yeah, I mean, he didn't watch them,"
59:02;59:03;"so I was like, ""Why would I watch them?"""
59:03;59:04;"- Not canon."
59:04;59:05;"- Wow."
59:05;59:06;"They don't count."
59:06;59:08;"- Not canon."
59:08;59:08;"- Twins."
59:08;59:12;"In one episode, what does Jerry say"
59:12;59:14;"his girlfriend's laugh sounds like?"
59:14;59:18;"- We're gonna need multiple tries for this."
59:18;59:20;"- I don't know this one."
59:20;59:22;"- A, Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer."
59:22;59:24;"B, Jake's Home Depot playlist."
59:24;59:28;"Z, a snorting pig."
59:28;59:29;"D, a monkey with a flu."
59:29;59:31;"- Wanna say Jake's Home Depot playlist,"
59:31;59:33;"but I feel like that's not it."
59:33;59:34;"Just the timeline doesn't work out on that one."
59:34;59:35;"- What was the first one?"
59:35;59:38;"- The first one is Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer."
59:38;59:39;"- I think that's it."
59:39;59:41;"- All right, let's go for it."
59:41;59:43;"- Ay!"
59:43;59:45;"- I don't even know what that means, though."
59:45;59:46;"- You know what, Elmer Fudd?"
59:46;59:48;"- What does the juicer do to the voice?"
59:48;59:51;"- I guess his buttocks would be shredded"
59:51;59:53;"into a bloody pulp by the juicer,"
59:53;59:55;"so it would be some kind of agonizing..."
59:55;59:58;"(laughing)"
59:58;59:59;"That's actually a really gnar image."
59:59;01:00:02;"You should have a word with your father about that."
01:00:02;01:00:05;"- I don't think that's appropriate for NBC must-see TV."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"I'm gonna write a letter."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"So this is game point for them."
01:00:09;01:00:10;"- This is game point."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"That is correct."
01:00:11;01:00:13;"All right, Yankees."
01:00:13;01:00:17;"What is one surefire way to open up Elaine's vault?"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"- I don't know."
01:00:19;01:00:20;"- I know it."
01:00:20;01:00:21;"- Oh, you know?"
01:00:21;01:00:21;"- That's all you."
01:00:21;01:00:22;"- All right."
01:00:22;01:00:24;"- It's alcohol, right?"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"It's the schnapps, the peach schnapps?"
01:00:26;01:00:27;"- That is right."
01:00:27;01:00:28;"- Okay."
01:00:28;01:00:31;"- Is vault a code word for her vagina?"
01:00:31;01:00:32;"- Yeah, the secrets that she keeps."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"(laughing)"
01:00:34;01:00:35;"- Or is it like her actual vault?"
01:00:35;01:00:36;"- No, no, no, it's the secrets that she keeps."
01:00:36;01:00:37;"- It's like her mental vault."
01:00:37;01:00:38;"- It's everything she knows."
01:00:38;01:00:38;"- Oh, no, okay."
01:00:38;01:00:41;"She says that, like, I don't tell secrets."
01:00:41;01:00:42;"- That's right."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"- It's a vault, but then the key to the vault is peach schnapps."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"- That's right."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"- The question was a little ambiguous."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"- Twins, we're gonna give you one more."
01:00:47;01:00:48;"If you get this, we're gonna go even,"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"and we'll tie and have a tiebreaker."
01:00:50;01:00:52;"What did Kramer call the fragrance"
01:00:52;01:00:54;"that Calvin Klein stole from him?"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"I'll give you multiple choice."
01:00:56;01:01:00;"The ocean, the breeze, the beach."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"The bread absconder."
01:01:03;01:01:08;"- Okay, the ocean, the breeze."
01:01:08;01:01:11;"I wanna say the ocean, man, I don't know."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"Do you have any idea, Jake?"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"- No."
01:01:13;01:01:15;"- I'm gonna go with the beach."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"Nice."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"(laughing)"
01:01:18;01:01:19;"Great Leonardo DiCaprio film."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"- Well done."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"- Okay."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"- All right, it's a tiebreaker."
01:01:22;01:01:25;"The closest team to this answer is going to win."
01:01:25;01:01:28;"What was the exact date of the first ever airing"
01:01:28;01:01:29;"of Seinfeld on TV?"
01:01:31;01:01:32;"- October."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"- October 3rd, '89."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"- I know it's '89."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"- I think it was October."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"- I think it was like June, right, though?"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"'Cause wasn't the show supposed to be like a summer?"
01:01:41;01:01:42;"- You should know 'cause you should be like"
01:01:42;01:01:43;"posting an Instagram on that."
01:01:43;01:01:44;"- You're ahead."
01:01:44;01:01:46;"- Right, right, yeah."
01:01:46;01:01:46;"- A real head would know."
01:01:46;01:01:49;"- I'm gonna really need an A now."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"I'm gonna need a final answer."
01:01:50;01:01:52;"- October 3rd, '89."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"- I'm with it."
01:01:54;01:01:55;"- We're locking you in."
01:01:55;01:01:55;"- Okay."
01:01:55;01:01:57;"- October 3rd, '89, all right."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"- Oh, the exact date."
01:01:58;01:02:03;"- I'm gonna say June 12th, '89."
01:02:03;01:02:07;"- The answer is July 5th, 1989."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"- Is it like the Price is Right"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"where you get the closest person?"
01:02:10;01:02:11;"- You win, you win."
01:02:11;01:02:12;"- You win."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"- Wow."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"- Okay, Seinfeld cred."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"- Just imagine that, man."
01:02:16;01:02:20;"July '89, George H.W. Bush is president."
01:02:20;01:02:22;"You just went to a barbecue."
01:02:22;01:02:25;"You got (beep) faced with your boys."
01:02:25;01:02:28;"You lie on the couch, hungover on July 5th."
01:02:28;01:02:31;"Turn it over to NBC."
01:02:31;01:02:34;"Catch a quirky new sitcom."
01:02:34;01:02:36;"(imitates music)"
01:02:36;01:02:41;"Immediately, you're taken by the rhythm of the bass line"
01:02:41;01:02:44;"and how the tempo matches Jerry's cadence."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"We had the composer of the Seinfeld theme song on once."
01:02:46;01:02:48;"- I actually heard about that."
01:02:48;01:02:49;"- And you're just like, what is this?"
01:02:49;01:02:50;"And then it opens."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"- You got a real wry sensibility."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"- And just two guys chopping it up in a diner."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"- This is a very self-conscious sitcom."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"- And you're like, you know what, man?"
01:02:58;01:03:01;"It's 1989, but I honestly feel like I'm witnessing"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"the beginning of the coming decade."
01:03:03;01:03:06;"(laughing)"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"All right, let's get into the top five."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"Kazzy, will you join us for the top five?"
01:03:10;01:03:11;"- Yes."
01:03:11;01:03:17;"- It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:03:17;01:03:20;"- Today on the top five, we're gonna be comparing"
01:03:20;01:03:24;"the top five iTunes songs right now in 2017"
01:03:24;01:03:27;"with the top five Billboard hits of 1989."
01:03:27;01:03:29;"- This week, '89."
01:03:29;01:03:31;"- This week in '89."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"Kazzy, does '89 mean much to you"
01:03:32;01:03:35;"outside of the launch of Seinfeld?"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"- No, I'm just curious, obviously these songs"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"are gonna be different."
01:03:38;01:03:42;"How are we supposed to compare songs that are so different?"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"- This is the backbone of this entire show."
01:03:44;01:03:47;"I mean, yeah, we listen to the number five song from 1989"
01:03:47;01:03:49;"and then we listen to the number five song from today."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"- And then you're like, yeah, they're different."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"- We compare, yeah, sometimes we're like, wow,"
01:03:53;01:03:54;"that one, the first one really sounded like it was from"
01:03:54;01:03:58;"1989, whereas the second had this more modern,"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"current 2017 feel."
01:04:00;01:04:01;"You know, that's one thing you might say."
01:04:01;01:04:02;"- Yeah, okay."
01:04:02;01:04:04;"(laughing)"
01:04:04;01:04:05;"- Sometimes there's weird parallels."
01:04:05;01:04:06;"- Sometimes there's weird parallels."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"- Lyrically or--"
01:04:08;01:04:09;"- Okay, I'm excited, yeah."
01:04:09;01:04:11;"- And then sometimes we just kind of imagine"
01:04:11;01:04:13;"what it was like, you know, similar to the guy"
01:04:13;01:04:15;"who was hungover after the Fourth of July"
01:04:15;01:04:18;"and happened to catch the first episode of Seinfeld."
01:04:18;01:04:18;"- Yeah."
01:04:18;01:04:20;"- And then we just imagine what was happening in 1989."
01:04:20;01:04:21;"So you were not alive."
01:04:21;01:04:22;"- I was not."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"- I was 12."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"- I was five."
01:04:25;01:04:26;"You know, this is gonna mean something different"
01:04:26;01:04:27;"to all of us."
01:04:27;01:04:28;"- This is a nice range here."
01:04:28;01:04:29;"- Yeah."
01:04:29;01:04:31;"So the number five song this week in 1989"
01:04:31;01:04:34;"is Naina Cherry, ""Buffalo Steps."""
01:04:34;01:04:35;"Good song."
01:04:35;01:04:36;"- Great song."

01:05:36;01:05:38;"- So her dad married like a Swedish model or something?"

01:06:05;01:06:07;"So when you hear like DJ scratching."
01:06:07;01:06:11;"- Yeah, that's definitely an 80s cliche."
01:06:11;01:06:12;"- Yeah."
01:06:12;01:06:15;"- Also lyrically, she's saying no money man."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"She's like, I'm not interested in a money man."
01:06:17;01:06:18;"- Right."
01:06:18;01:06:19;"- That's like some 60s stuff."
01:06:19;01:06:20;"- That's very popular."
01:06:20;01:06:25;"- But the way people rap, how much can it change?"
01:06:25;01:06:28;"Because you're just talking in a beat, you know?"
01:06:28;01:06:29;"- Oh, it can change quite a bit."
01:06:29;01:06:29;"- Oh, it's changed."
01:06:29;01:06:31;"Yeah, that was very stiff, I thought."
01:06:31;01:06:33;"- I just think like the flow changes."
01:06:33;01:06:34;"- Yeah."
01:06:34;01:06:35;"- Like, well, what's like a big rap song?"
01:06:35;01:06:36;"Do you listen to rap?"
01:06:36;01:06:37;"- Yeah."
01:06:37;01:06:39;"- What's like your favorite new rap song?"
01:06:39;01:06:41;"All My Friends Are Dead, that one?"
01:06:41;01:06:41;"- No."
01:06:41;01:06:44;"- Everybody loves that song."
01:06:44;01:06:45;"- She doesn't like being put on the spot."
01:06:45;01:06:47;"- Yeah, no, I'm sorry to put you on the spot."
01:06:47;01:06:48;"- I like the new future song,"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"but you can't understand what he's saying."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"So it's not a good example."
01:06:51;01:06:53;"- But like, Percocet, Molly Percocet."
01:06:53;01:06:54;"- Oh, that one."
01:06:54;01:06:56;"- That's like that rhythm feels very current."
01:06:56;01:06:57;"- Yeah."
01:06:57;01:07:01;"But he isn't like a good example of rapping"
01:07:01;01:07:03;"'cause it's such a different style, it feels like."
01:07:03;01:07:07;"But that girl, like that could have been Nicki Minaj."
01:07:07;01:07:09;"- Yeah, if that came out today, it would still be cool."
01:07:09;01:07:11;"1989 was not that long ago."
01:07:12;01:07:16;"- The number five song today is David Cuetta"
01:07:16;01:07:18;"featuring Justin Bieber."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"- The song sucks."
01:07:20;01:07:20;"- Oh!"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"- Well, I like you have an opinion though, it's nice."
01:07:22;01:07:24;"- I like that you have an, yeah."
01:07:24;01:07:25;"That's nice."
01:07:25;01:07:26;"- Is this the--"
01:07:26;01:07:27;"- This Too You?"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"- Desperado."
01:07:28;01:07:29;"- No, it's Too You."
01:07:29;01:07:30;"- Oh."
01:07:30;01:07:33;"- Wait, Desperado, you think, no, Despacito."
01:07:33;01:07:34;"Did you just think of The Eagles?"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"- Did you guys see the video of Justin Bieber"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"like not knowing the words to it?"
01:07:38;01:07:39;"- I've heard about this, we'll get into that in a little bit."
01:07:39;01:07:42;"- I don't know anything about that."
01:07:42;01:07:44;"God, Bieber's all over the top five recently."
01:07:44;01:07:46;"- Biggest singer in the world, man."
01:07:46;01:07:47;"- He's amazing."
01:07:47;01:07:49;"- So you like Justin, but you think this song sucks?"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"- Yeah, I just don't like this song."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"This song feels outdated."
01:07:53;01:07:56;"This song feels like it could have been 2014, '15."
01:07:56;01:07:57;"- What's wrong with that?"
01:07:57;01:07:58;"That was only two years ago."
01:07:58;01:08:00;"- It's just that we've heard this like drop"
01:08:00;01:08:03;"and it's just, it doesn't feel new or fun."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"Like, do you can't, what do you do to this song?"
01:08:05;01:08:07;"- You've been enjoying the more tropical Justin"
01:08:07;01:08:08;"and this feels like regressive?"
01:08:08;01:08:10;"- This just feels like not,"
01:08:10;01:08:13;"like what do you can't really dance to this song."
01:08:13;01:08:15;"You wouldn't really listen to this in the car."
01:08:15;01:08:16;"- This kind of has like a Jersey Shore vibe."
01:08:16;01:08:18;"This is like a fist pumper."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"- Yeah."
01:08:19;01:08:21;"- What's the drop?"
01:08:21;01:08:22;"- Also the lyrics are weird."
01:08:22;01:08:23;"- What are the lyrics?"
01:08:23;01:08:26;"- They're like our souls intertwine."
01:08:26;01:08:27;"- Oh, okay."
01:08:27;01:08:27;"- But shut up."
01:08:27;01:08:29;"- This sounds like the new Phoenix there."
01:08:29;01:08:30;"- The new Phoenix?"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"- That drop there."
01:08:31;01:08:33;"- It might be a little bit in common."
01:08:33;01:08:34;"Wait, so it sounds like you're a Justin fan."
01:08:34;01:08:35;"- I am a Justin fan, yeah."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"- Are you a head?"
01:08:37;01:08:39;"- Are you a Stan?"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"- Is Stan just like a little less than head?"
01:08:41;01:08:42;"- It's like beyond head."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"- I'm the one level less than head."
01:08:44;01:08:45;"- Have you seen him live?"
01:08:45;01:08:46;"- Yes."
01:08:46;01:08:47;"- How many times?"
01:08:47;01:08:48;"- Once."
01:08:48;01:08:49;"- Have you ever chopped it up with him?"
01:08:49;01:08:51;"- No, I have not."
01:08:51;01:08:52;"- You never, you got the picture backstage?"
01:08:52;01:08:53;"- No, no, no."
01:08:53;01:08:54;"- Near a waiting line?"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"- No, not about that."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"- Okay."
01:08:57;01:08:58;"Respect."
01:08:58;01:09:01;"The number four song this week in 1989,"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"Richard Marx,"
01:09:03;01:09:06;"satisfied from the album Repeat Offender."
01:09:06;01:09:08;"- Wait, wait, what's satisfied?"
01:09:08;01:09:09;"- I don't know."
01:09:09;01:09:12;"What does Richard Marx actually sound like?"
01:09:12;01:09:15;"- Oh, this is like up-tempo Marx."
01:09:15;01:09:17;"'Cause he's like the king of the power ballad."
01:09:17;01:09:19;"- This sounds super '89 to me."
01:09:19;01:09:22;"- Oh my God."
01:09:22;01:09:27;"- Brutal."
01:09:27;01:09:34;"- I've never heard up-tempo Marx."
01:09:37;01:09:46;"- This is terrible."
01:09:46;01:09:49;"- I'm kind of amped."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"- This would be..."
01:09:50;01:09:52;"- It's a good movie song."
01:09:52;01:09:53;"- Oh yeah."
01:09:53;01:09:53;"Montage scene?"
01:09:53;01:09:55;"- Yeah, an old movie."
01:09:55;01:09:56;"- I'm waiting for the hook here."
01:09:56;01:09:57;"- Yeah, this is like the try..."
01:09:57;01:09:58;"- I thought that was the hook."
01:09:58;01:09:59;"- This is like the verse."

01:10:03;01:10:06;"- Here we go."
01:10:06;01:10:23;"- This is crazy."
01:10:23;01:10:28;"- This is like Rod Stewart meets Brian Adams,"

01:18:58;01:18:59;"to bed sheet body territory."
01:18:59;01:19:00;"- Exactly."
01:19:00;01:19:04;"- I like that Harry at least went,"
01:19:04;01:19:07;"he didn't do a song about sex or bodies."
01:19:07;01:19:08;"- Yeah, same."
01:19:08;01:19:09;"- Not because there's anything wrong with that,"
01:19:09;01:19:10;"but it's just like enough for it."
01:19:10;01:19:13;"- It's always respectable for people"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"to not make music about that."
01:19:15;01:19:19;"- So Niall, his song is kind of about sex as I recall."
01:19:19;01:19:21;"This one's called ""Slow Hands."""
01:19:21;01:19:22;"And Niall has--"
01:19:22;01:19:22;"- ""Slow Hands?"""
01:19:22;01:19:23;"- Yeah."
01:19:23;01:19:24;"- Ugh."
01:19:24;01:19:25;"- Is this about Eric Clapton?"
01:19:25;01:19:27;"- Yeah, you know what?"
01:19:27;01:19:29;"""Slow Hands,"" it's like in a perfect world,"
01:19:29;01:19:31;"we'd hear about Niall Horan's song called ""Slow Hands."""
01:19:31;01:19:33;"We're like, maybe he's talking about"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"doing some like carpentry, some whittling."
01:19:35;01:19:37;"- Wait, is this a song,"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"the whole fantasy about me running a hardware store?"
01:19:39;01:19:39;"- Yes, because this is--"
01:19:39;01:19:41;"- Is Niall working for me?"
01:19:41;01:19:43;"- You know, he's like ""Boys"" with Don Henley now."
01:19:43;01:19:44;"He's very inspired by the Eagles."
01:19:44;01:19:45;"- Oh, yeah."
01:19:45;01:19:46;"- You Eagles fan?"
01:19:46;01:19:47;"- Yeah, I love the Eagles."
01:19:47;01:19:50;"- Okay, so now Horan, similar, like Harry's vibe is kind,"
01:19:50;01:19:54;"Zayn was like, I'm going kind of like R&B, modern pop sounds."
01:19:54;01:19:57;"Harry was like, I'm going for the tasteful '70s palette"
01:19:57;01:19:58;"of like David Bowie and stuff."
01:19:58;01:20:00;"And now it was like, I just want to sound like"
01:20:00;01:20:01;"early Don Henley solo."
01:20:01;01:20:03;"- Early '80s Henley."
01:20:03;01:20:03;"- Yeah."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"- Dirty laundry."
01:20:05;01:20:06;"- Is this top three?"
01:20:06;01:20:07;"- Yeah, this is number three."
01:20:07;01:20:08;"- Oh, good for him."
01:20:08;01:20:10;"- Back in the top five."
01:20:10;01:20:13;"- Yeah, yeah, this song is doing well."
01:20:13;01:20:14;"- Got legs."
01:20:14;01:20:16;"- Oh, I think I've heard this, I just didn't know it was him."

01:21:20;01:21:21;"- The tasteful palate of early '80s Don Henley."
01:21:21;01:21:23;"Wait, Jake, you know somebody emailed us a while ago"
01:21:23;01:21:24;"'cause we were talking about it?"
01:21:24;01:21:25;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:21:25;01:21:29;"- And they said that Don Henley calls Nalhorn son,"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"and Nalhorn calls Don Henley dad."
01:21:31;01:21:33;"- How often are they hanging out?"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"- It might be over the phone or via text."
01:21:35;01:21:36;"- Whoa."
01:21:36;01:21:40;"And I wonder what if Don's just like--"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"- Dad, have you heard my new single?"
01:21:42;01:21:43;"Yes, son."
01:21:43;01:21:47;"I love the tasteful palate that you're referencing."
01:21:47;01:21:49;"- I love that you're riffing on my material"
01:21:49;01:21:50;"from 35 years ago."
01:21:50;01:21:54;"I wonder if Don's like, I like what you're doing, Nal,"
01:21:54;01:21:58;"and I think your lyrics are gonna mature as you mature."
01:21:58;01:21:59;"- Don Henley's very supportive."
01:21:59;01:22:01;"He's like out there doing press for Nal,"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"being like, I love this kid."
01:22:03;01:22:05;"He's got what it takes."
01:22:05;01:22:07;"The thing I also like about Nal is that,"
01:22:07;01:22:08;"'cause you were saying that there's this kind of like"
01:22:08;01:22:11;"Zayn-Harry thing, Harry maybe is supposed to go solo first,"
01:22:11;01:22:12;"and then be like Zayn or Harry."
01:22:12;01:22:16;"And then Nal's like slow and steady, winning the race."
01:22:16;01:22:21;"- Yeah, but also there's the other kid, Louis Toml."
01:22:21;01:22:24;"- Yeah, Louis, he's got a tough road ahead."
01:22:24;01:22:26;"- Who's the young in this equation?"
01:22:26;01:22:30;"- There's not one."
01:22:30;01:22:31;"- Okay."
01:22:31;01:22:36;"- But Louis' song is like kind of like rocking too,"
01:22:36;01:22:39;"but he's like a really,"
01:22:39;01:22:41;"one of those really annoying faces, so."
01:22:41;01:22:42;"- Oh, you just don't like his face?"
01:22:42;01:22:43;"- Hate his face."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"- What also I like about in this crew,"
01:22:45;01:22:47;"it's like the two guys with the slowest start"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"also have babies."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"- Oh my God."
01:22:50;01:22:52;"Wait, no, that guy isn't solo yet."
01:22:52;01:22:53;"- That's Liam."
01:22:53;01:22:55;"He just dropped his first single, but he has a baby."
01:22:55;01:22:56;"- How's the single?"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"- It's not great."
01:22:58;01:23:00;"It's not in the top five, as we can see."
01:23:00;01:23:02;"But I also, I really like that all these other guys"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"are racing each other to release their singles."
01:23:04;01:23:08;"And whereas Liam had a baby with Cheryl Cole,"
01:23:08;01:23:11;"who used to be one of my favorite British pop stars."
01:23:11;01:23:12;"- Oh, (beep)"
01:23:12;01:23:13;"- I don't know who that is."
01:23:13;01:23:15;"- I don't know that, yeah, that's crazy."
01:23:15;01:23:16;"- Good for him."
01:23:16;01:23:17;"- That's great."
01:23:17;01:23:18;"- He linked up with a single mom,"
01:23:18;01:23:20;"10 years older than him, had a baby with her."
01:23:20;01:23:23;"These guys are out, you know, grinding in the studio."
01:23:23;01:23:25;"He's becoming a father."
01:23:25;01:23:26;"Good for him."
01:23:26;01:23:27;"- Pretty dope."
01:23:27;01:23:30;"- Out of everything produced by Solo One Direction,"
01:23:30;01:23:34;"Liam's baby is the best thing that came out of it."
01:23:34;01:23:37;"It's better than any Harry's Tasteful Palette."
01:23:37;01:23:39;"It's better than Slow Hounds."
01:23:39;01:23:42;"I just feel like if you were in a boy band with five guys"
01:23:42;01:23:43;"and you see these guys like in this arms race,"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"who's going to be solo first?"
01:23:45;01:23:46;"Wouldn't you want to be the guy who's like,"
01:23:46;01:23:48;"I'm going to have a baby with Cheryl Cole?"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"- And give it like 10 years."
01:23:50;01:23:51;"- Yeah."
01:23:51;01:23:54;"- Liam's going to drop like a cool singer songwriter record"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"in like seven years."
01:23:56;01:23:59;"He did drop one single already featuring Quavo."
01:23:59;01:24:03;"It wasn't what I was hoping for, but whatever."
01:24:03;01:24:05;"I like that he's taking his time."
01:24:05;01:24:06;"- Yeah."
01:24:06;01:24:08;"You think it's weird though, like,"
01:24:08;01:24:09;"what else are they going to do?"
01:24:09;01:24:10;"They're obviously going to go solo."
01:24:10;01:24:11;"There's nothing else for them to do,"
01:24:11;01:24:12;"but it's still annoying."
01:24:12;01:24:14;"Like, oh yeah, you're going to go solo."
01:24:14;01:24:18;"Like obviously, but it's why wouldn't they?"
01:24:18;01:24:18;"- Yeah, you know."
01:24:18;01:24:19;"- They just kind of have to, right?"
01:24:19;01:24:20;"- Yeah, what else are they going to do?"
01:24:20;01:24:21;"- No, but they're singers."
01:24:21;01:24:22;"- They don't have to."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"All these guys are worth,"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"well, I don't know what kind of deal they had."
01:24:26;01:24:28;"I'm guessing they all have at least like 30 mil."
01:24:28;01:24:29;"- Jeez."
01:24:29;01:24:30;"- Yeah, they definitely do."
01:24:30;01:24:32;"- That's a lot of money, Ezra."
01:24:32;01:24:33;"- I know, I know."
01:24:33;01:24:34;"Of course it's a lot."
01:24:34;01:24:35;"- That's a crazy amount of money."
01:24:35;01:24:35;"I'm actually surprised by that."
01:24:35;01:24:37;"- They're like the biggest band in the world for a while."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"Okay, let's say all these guys--"
01:24:38;01:24:41;"- I thought bands didn't make any money anymore."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"- They definitely made a lot of money."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"- These guys are going around the world"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"playing stadiums, massive."
01:24:47;01:24:50;"So let's say each of these guys has, I don't know, 20 mil."
01:24:50;01:24:53;"Oh, actually now Nick's showing us,"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"maybe they're worth 50 mil."
01:24:55;01:24:56;"- I'm just saying it'd be interesting"
01:24:56;01:24:57;"if one of those guys was like,"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"you know what, I got 50 mil."
01:24:59;01:25:02;"I'm gonna open up like a sandwich,"
01:25:02;01:25:03;"chain of sandwich stuff. - I can't think of anything"
01:25:03;01:25:04;"that they should do,"
01:25:04;01:25:05;"but I wanna think of something else"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"they would be good at."
01:25:07;01:25:09;"- Maybe you should invite one of them"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"to intern on your web series."
01:25:11;01:25:13;"- Yeah, they would have a really good time."
01:25:13;01:25:14;"- Maybe some of them can act."
01:25:14;01:25:16;"- I'm literally the intern on my web series."
01:25:16;01:25:18;"Like that's how low budget it is."
01:25:18;01:25:19;"- You're your own intern."
01:25:19;01:25:21;"- I'm going to pick up the equipment."
01:25:21;01:25:23;"- Dude, let's have Liam call in."
01:25:23;01:25:24;"- Let's see if we can get Liam."
01:25:24;01:25:25;"- I'm a baby."
01:25:25;01:25:27;"- Let's see if we can get a single member of one date."
01:25:27;01:25:30;"- Yeah, 'cause I bet one of them is a Vampire Weekend head."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"I bet one of them is."
01:25:32;01:25:34;"- That would be real bad if none of them are."
01:25:34;01:25:37;"- So listeners of Time Crisis,"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"if no one from One Direction ever calls in,"
01:25:39;01:25:39;"that means they all hate Vampire Weekend."
01:25:39;01:25:42;"- I'm trying to think of like any,"
01:25:42;01:25:45;"nah, I've never heard it through the grapevine."
01:25:45;01:25:48;"It wouldn't be hard to get in touch with some of these guys."
01:25:48;01:25:50;"We got plenty of connections to them."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"- I'd like to have the guy that does the Don Hen,"
01:25:52;01:25:53;"Niall call in."
01:25:53;01:25:54;"- Let's see if we can get Niall."
01:25:54;01:25:56;"- You guys can totally get Niall."
01:25:56;01:25:57;"- Talk Henley with him."
01:25:57;01:25:58;"- That's easy."
01:25:58;01:25:59;"- Let's talk Eagles with Niall."
01:25:59;01:26:00;"That'd be tight."
01:26:00;01:26:03;"- I think if we came to him respectfully"
01:26:03;01:26:06;"and we were like, ""Niall, no gotcha journalism."
01:26:06;01:26:07;"We just want to talk to you"
01:26:07;01:26:08;"about your love of early Don Henley."""
01:26:08;01:26:10;"- No, let's just talk Eagles."
01:26:10;01:26:11;"- Just talking Eagles."
01:26:11;01:26:12;"- I don't want to talk about you."
01:26:12;01:26:14;"I just want to talk about the Eagles."
01:26:14;01:26:15;"- Yeah."
01:26:15;01:26:18;"And maybe we ask him about the other guys."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"- No, I don't even know who they are."
01:26:19;01:26:20;"I could care less."
01:26:20;01:26:21;"- I think it's like in their contract"
01:26:21;01:26:24;"they don't talk about the other ones."
01:26:24;01:26:25;"- Oh really?"
01:26:25;01:26:25;"- I've never even heard One Direction."
01:26:25;01:26:26;"- I assume so."
01:26:26;01:26:27;"- That'd be smart."
01:26:27;01:26:31;"Okay, I like this idea."
01:26:31;01:26:33;"Let's get Niall on the phone talking Eagles."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"- I feel like Niall, Jake can't name"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"a single One Direction song."
01:26:36;01:26:38;"So it's so chill."
01:26:38;01:26:39;"- No, no, no, but you can't."
01:26:39;01:26:42;"See Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake."
01:26:42;01:26:43;"- You can't even mention One Direction."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"- Let's just talk Eagles."
01:26:45;01:26:46;"- But you gotta be respectful"
01:26:46;01:26:46;"'cause you gotta understand."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"- No, I am respectful."
01:26:47;01:26:49;"- No, no, no, these are young men"
01:26:49;01:26:54;"who they know that you're looking at them"
01:26:54;01:26:56;"and you're like these guys have got 50 mil each."
01:26:56;01:26:56;"- No, I'm not."
01:26:56;01:26:58;"- And you're like these guys are untouchable."
01:26:58;01:27:01;"But in their minds, they're a little insecure"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"about like do grown men respect their music?"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"- No, that's not the vibe I'm bringing, man."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"I don't think of them as untouchable."
01:27:07;01:27:10;"What I'm saying is I'm not a fan."
01:27:10;01:27:14;"And what I'm saying is that's what I'm saying."
01:27:14;01:27:16;"If I was like nervous and like thought these guys"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"were like amazing rock stars,"
01:27:18;01:27:20;"then it would be like an awkward, stilted interview."
01:27:20;01:27:25;"What I'm saying is man to man, let's just talk Eagles."
01:27:25;01:27:28;"- Okay, so just don't lead with the I'm not a fan part."
01:27:28;01:27:32;"- Maybe just don't air this conversation"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"and you'll have a good chance."
01:27:34;01:27:36;"- That's a good idea."
01:27:36;01:27:39;"I think you just guaranteed that it will be aired though."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"All right, let's go back to 1989."
01:27:40;01:27:42;"Okay, we all know this song."
01:27:42;01:27:45;"Bette Midler, this is from the Beaches soundtrack."
01:27:45;01:27:46;"You don't like B words."
01:27:46;01:27:48;"Are you cool with W words?"
01:27:48;01:27:48;"- Yeah, why?"
01:27:48;01:27:52;"- Like wind and wings?"
01:27:52;01:27:53;"- No, not anymore."
01:27:53;01:28:01;"- I don't know if I know this."
01:28:01;01:28:06;"♪ It must have been cold there in my shadow ♪"
01:28:06;01:28:07;"- Bette Midler."
01:28:07;01:28:07;"- Don't know it."
01:28:07;01:28:10;"- Born December 1st, 1945."
01:28:10;01:28:11;"- So unnecessary."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"- In Honolulu."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"- Interesting military family."
01:28:15;01:28:17;"- When Hawaii was still a territory."
01:28:17;01:28:18;"- Dude, right at World War."
01:28:18;01:28:19;"- Kazzy, did you know that Bette Midler"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"wasn't even born in the state?"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"- I did not."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"- She was born in territory."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"As a young girl in Hawaii,"
01:28:26;01:28:29;"Bette worked at a pineapple processing plant."
01:28:29;01:28:30;"- What?"
01:28:30;01:28:31;"- A what?"
01:28:31;01:28:32;"- This is blowing my mind."
01:28:32;01:28:32;"- A pineapple plant?"
01:28:32;01:28:34;"- Did you two seriously didn't know"
01:28:34;01:28:37;"that Bette Midler worked at a pineapple processing plant"
01:28:37;01:28:38;"as a young girl in Hawaii?"
01:28:38;01:28:38;"- No."
01:28:38;01:28:40;"- That's such a cute story."
01:28:40;01:28:42;"Like I wanna have worked at a pineapple plant."
01:28:42;01:28:44;"- That sounds brutal."
01:28:44;01:28:46;"That sounds like the worst job ever."
01:28:47;01:28:47;"- Depends what you're doing."
01:28:47;01:28:49;"- That's a cute job."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"- I'm picturing like a canning facility."
01:28:51;01:28:52;"- That's cute."
01:28:52;01:28:53;"- It's like a John Steinbeck novel."
01:28:53;01:28:56;"You're like working 14 hour shifts and canning."
01:28:56;01:28:58;"- Yeah, the canning aspect is kind of brutal."
01:28:58;01:29:01;"- Just like dull pineapple on the shelf."
01:29:01;01:29:02;"- All right guys, here comes the chorus."
01:29:02;01:29:03;"- What is this?"
01:29:03;01:29:07;"♪ Did you ever know that you're my hero ♪"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"- So her dad was like military straight up."
01:29:09;01:29:10;"- Who knows?"
01:29:10;01:29:13;"- What if people live in Honolulu?"
01:29:13;01:29:14;"- No, but she's born,"
01:29:14;01:29:16;"she was conceived during World War II in Hawaii."
01:29:16;01:29:20;"- That's good math."
01:29:20;01:29:21;"- That's like, thank you."
01:29:21;01:29:26;"But you know, that's like the Pacific Theater."
01:29:26;01:29:26;"- That's true."
01:29:26;01:29:30;"♪ You are the wind beneath my wings ♪"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"- You know, this is a beautiful song."
01:29:32;01:29:35;"The less than tasteful late 80s palette,"
01:29:35;01:29:38;"I don't love."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"- Yeah, it's rough."
01:29:39;01:29:40;"- You know what I would love to hear,"
01:29:40;01:29:41;"a wind beneath my wings,"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"with kind of the more tasteful 70s palette"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"of like a Harry Styles record."
01:29:45;01:29:46;"- Or Niall even."
01:29:46;01:29:47;"- Or even Niall."
01:29:47;01:29:50;"- Niall would do a lovely version of this."
01:29:50;01:29:53;"- So much reverb on everything."
01:29:53;01:29:55;"Oh, the drums."
01:29:55;01:29:57;"I wanna hear this dried out"
01:29:57;01:30:01;"with that kind of tasteful Niall Harry sound."
01:30:01;01:30:04;"The number two song, back to Bieber."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"This is a spoiler,"
01:30:06;01:30:09;"but Bieber's got three songs in the top five right now."
01:30:09;01:30:11;"He's kind of the king of music."
01:30:11;01:30:13;"This song is called ""I'm the One""."
01:30:13;01:30:14;"- TJ Khaled, but Justin is-"
01:30:14;01:30:15;"- I hate this song."
01:30:15;01:30:16;"- You hate this song?"
01:30:16;01:30:16;"- Yeah."
01:30:16;01:30:18;"- As a Bieber fan, you hate two of his current singles?"
01:30:18;01:30:19;"- Yeah, it sucks."
01:30:19;01:30:20;"- Wow."
01:30:20;01:30:21;"- What sucks about it?"
01:30:21;01:30:22;"- It's really annoying."
01:30:22;01:30:23;"- So he's peaked?"
01:30:23;01:30:26;"- No, I know he has more in him, obviously."
01:30:26;01:30:29;"It's like bedrock, but not as good."
01:30:29;01:30:29;"- Oh, bedrock, that was a good song."
01:30:29;01:30:31;"- Bedrock was so dope."
01:30:31;01:30:33;"And this is just the worst version of it."
01:30:33;01:30:35;"- Yeah, they're both kind of like happy rap songs."
01:30:35;01:30:36;"- Exactly."
01:30:41;01:30:44;"♪ We the best music ♪"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"- Nick loves it."
01:30:46;01:30:47;"- That's pretty catchy."
01:30:47;01:30:49;"- I don't mind it."
01:30:49;01:30:54;"- It's really good in the headphones."
01:30:54;01:30:56;"- Yeah, that synth bass is pretty good."
01:30:56;01:30:57;"- Yeah."
01:31:09;01:31:11;"- Justin Bieber writes his lyrics?"
01:31:11;01:31:12;"- No."
01:31:12;01:31:13;"- No."
01:31:13;01:31:15;"He should work with a different lyricist."
01:31:15;01:31:17;"- In fact, Justin Bieber's not even credited"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"as the songwriter on this."
01:31:19;01:31:20;"- That's so funny."
01:31:20;01:31:24;"- So Jake, this song is gonna be on DJ Khaled's"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"fourth coming album, you know what the album's called?"
01:31:26;01:31:27;"- No."
01:31:27;01:31:28;"- Grateful."
01:31:28;01:31:31;"- That's so classic, though."
01:31:31;01:31:33;"- Jake's a big Grateful Dead fan."
01:31:33;01:31:33;"- Huge."
01:31:33;01:31:36;"- Grateful Dead's just in the atmosphere right now."
01:31:36;01:31:36;"- Oh, wow."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"- That picture is so cute."
01:31:38;01:31:39;"- That's a great cover."
01:31:39;01:31:40;"- It's such a good cover."
01:31:40;01:31:42;"- You're a fan of his son?"
01:31:42;01:31:43;"- I didn't know it was his son,"
01:31:43;01:31:46;"and I saw that picture and I was like, that's so cute."
01:31:46;01:31:50;"But if you just imagine the placement of that happening,"
01:31:50;01:31:51;"trying to get that picture,"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"it's such a different experience."
01:31:53;01:31:54;"- No, that's a really good point."
01:31:54;01:31:55;"I'm sure you thought about this a lot,"
01:31:55;01:31:58;"'cause your show is a lot about social media and stuff."
01:31:58;01:32:00;"You see an image on Instagram,"
01:32:00;01:32:01;"and actually another one of the episodes"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"was kind of all about you trying to get somebody"
01:32:03;01:32:06;"to post a picture to make a point to your ex-boyfriend,"
01:32:06;01:32:09;"and it's funny, you could see a picture"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"and just take it at face value and be like, that's so cute."
01:32:11;01:32:15;"Look at this gorgeous little baby in a pool."
01:32:15;01:32:17;"And then if you take it one step deeper,"
01:32:17;01:32:21;"you're imagining parents of a three-month-old baby"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"placing him in a pool."
01:32:23;01:32:24;"- Please put your arms up."
01:32:24;01:32:26;"- Putting his arms down and being like,"
01:32:26;01:32:28;"hey, chill, chill, chill, hey, hey, hey."
01:32:28;01:32:29;"- With the photo lights."
01:32:29;01:32:31;"- Yeah, bright lights on the baby."
01:32:31;01:32:34;"- So when are the bubbles going in the jacuzzi?"
01:32:35;01:32:38;"- Also, okay, I know they had to get the picture,"
01:32:38;01:32:41;"and I've never been a parent,"
01:32:41;01:32:44;"but I feel like babies in pools"
01:32:44;01:32:47;"seems like a really stressful situation."
01:32:47;01:32:48;"I mean, it's really brutal."
01:32:48;01:32:50;"You hear these horrible stories."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"You know, even OJ's daughter in Brentwood,"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"he lost a child drowning in a pool."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"It's awful. - Really?"
01:32:55;01:32:56;"- Yeah, it's awful, it's awful."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"I'm not trying to bring down the whole vibe here."
01:32:58;01:32:59;"- No, man. - I'm just saying--"
01:32:59;01:33:00;"- My whole day is ruined, honestly."
01:33:00;01:33:02;"- It's super stressful, pools and kids."
01:33:04;01:33:05;"I understand, right, Nick, you're a parent, right?"
01:33:05;01:33:06;"That's stressful."
01:33:06;01:33:08;"- It makes me think of that Nirvana cover."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"- Yeah, you see, exactly."
01:33:10;01:33:14;"- And that kid is probably like 25 now, 26."
01:33:14;01:33:16;"- I feel like every year he pops up,"
01:33:16;01:33:17;"they're like, really? - That kid has gotten"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"so much publicity. - I know, it's like--"
01:33:19;01:33:20;"- I don't even know. - Yeah, just for that."
01:33:20;01:33:23;"- It's always like, it's the 19th anniversary of,"
01:33:23;01:33:24;"never mind. - It's the 20th."
01:33:24;01:33:26;"- Let's catch up with the kid."
01:33:26;01:33:28;"It's the 21st and a half anniversary."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"- It's really-- - Let's catch up with the kid."
01:33:30;01:33:32;"- We have different internet--"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"- I know, I've seen that so, I've been like,"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"I am so sick of this. - He recreates the picture"
01:33:36;01:33:38;"every year. - Does he really?"
01:33:38;01:33:41;"- Yeah. - Oh my God."
01:33:41;01:33:42;"- I don't know. - Okay."
01:33:42;01:33:44;"- I'm just saying, babies-- - I feel embarrassed"
01:33:44;01:33:46;"bringing it up. - Babies in pools"
01:33:46;01:33:49;"is stressful. - It's so stressful."
01:33:49;01:33:52;"And you just like, everyone knows at least one story."
01:33:52;01:33:52;"- Right. - Yeah, some horrible story."
01:33:52;01:33:56;"- But I'm wondering about DJ Khaled."
01:33:56;01:33:59;"I mean, you put a baby in a pool."
01:33:59;01:34:01;"- Of course it's safe, nothing was gonna happen."
01:34:01;01:34:02;"I'm not trying to put him on blast."
01:34:02;01:34:03;"- I'm not worried about the kid."
01:34:03;01:34:07;"What I'm saying is, how can you not think about Nirvana?"
01:34:07;01:34:08;"I mean, that's like-- - With the kid in the pool?"
01:34:08;01:34:10;"- One of the most iconic covers ever."
01:34:10;01:34:12;"- Oh, well that's because Nirvana's less culturally relevant"
01:34:12;01:34:15;"than DJ Khaled in 2017, Jake."
01:34:15;01:34:17;"Is that fair enough to say as a younger millennial?"
01:34:17;01:34:19;"- Well, I mean-- - No, I would just say"
01:34:19;01:34:22;"that he is above water in the art."
01:34:22;01:34:25;"So just because there's water in it,"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"similar to the Seinfeld friends."
01:34:27;01:34:30;"Your argument is-- - There's a lot in common"
01:34:30;01:34:31;"but they're very different shows."
01:34:31;01:34:33;"- Yes. - And maybe, Jake,"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"in your opinion, DJ Khaled's album cover"
01:34:35;01:34:35;"is the friends of the situation."
01:34:35;01:34:38;"- The baby looks so hood in this cover,"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"it's like nothing like it, almost."
01:34:40;01:34:41;"- It's a very different vibe."
01:34:41;01:34:42;"- Well, you're saying-- - Different atmosphere."
01:34:42;01:34:45;"- Different tonally. - Very tonally different."
01:34:45;01:34:47;"The number one song this week in 19--"
01:34:47;01:34:48;"- Damn it."
01:34:48;01:34:52;"- What, Jake, it's the changing of the guard, man."
01:34:52;01:34:55;"Kurt's gone, dude, 20 years."
01:34:55;01:34:57;"- Kurt's gone, Jerry's gone."
01:34:57;01:35:00;"- Jerry's gone, man, 2017."
01:35:00;01:35:02;"- Kurt and Jerry died in consecutive years,"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"that's a rough run."
01:35:04;01:35:06;"- And then Tupac and Biggie."
01:35:06;01:35:08;"They're all gone, man."
01:35:08;01:35:12;"All we got now is Niall and Justin, deal."
01:35:12;01:35:15;"Justin is Jerry, Niall's Kurt."
01:35:15;01:35:17;"It is what it is, man."
01:35:17;01:35:19;"- That's such a sad thought."
01:35:19;01:35:20;"- Okay, you know what, Jake?"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"Next time Niall Horan comes to town,"
01:35:22;01:35:25;"you and me are gonna take a tab of acid each"
01:35:25;01:35:27;"and just take it all in, man."
01:35:27;01:35:28;"It's gonna be fun."
01:35:28;01:35:29;"- In."
01:35:30;01:35:31;"- Hundred."
01:35:31;01:35:34;"- The number, what was it, Hundo P?"
01:35:34;01:35:34;"- Hundo P."
01:35:34;01:35:37;"- Hundo P, my man, Hundo P."
01:35:37;01:35:40;"The number one song this week in 1989."
01:35:40;01:35:41;"Do you know New Kids on the Block?"
01:35:41;01:35:42;"- Yeah."
01:35:42;01:35:44;"- Do you know New Kids on the Block?"
01:35:44;01:35:45;"- Yeah, of course."
01:35:45;01:35:48;"- Boy bands, there's always a boy band."
01:35:48;01:35:49;"- Will there always be boy bands, though?"
01:35:49;01:35:50;"- Write stuff, hang tough."
01:35:50;01:35:52;"- You know, that's a good question."
01:35:52;01:35:53;"By the time One Direction came out,"
01:35:53;01:35:54;"it almost seemed like--"
01:35:54;01:35:55;"- It was like weird."
01:35:55;01:35:56;"- It was like people were like,"
01:35:56;01:35:57;"we don't need boy bands anymore."
01:35:57;01:36:00;"We got Justin Bieber, we have--"
01:36:00;01:36:03;"- Well, I think the double of the Backstreet Boys"
01:36:03;01:36:06;"and NSYNC kinda killed it."
01:36:06;01:36:08;"- It was too much, yeah."
01:36:08;01:36:09;"- Too much at one time."
01:36:09;01:36:11;"- I don't know this song."
01:36:11;01:36:15;"- Again, a less than tasteful palette, I would say."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"- I love the use of palette."
01:36:17;01:36:20;"It's so hilarious. - That's a long-running thing."
01:36:20;01:36:23;"Would you consider this a tasteful palette?"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"- I don't even know what that means."
01:36:26;01:36:28;"- Well, the thing is, Jake loves the tasteful palette"
01:36:28;01:36:32;"of, say, 1970s rock, like The Eagles or something."
01:36:32;01:36:34;"- Warm tones."
01:36:34;01:36:36;"- Whereas Jake-- - I like it warm."
01:36:36;01:36:37;"- Organic. - Yeah."
01:36:37;01:36:38;"- It's very non-aggressive."
01:36:38;01:36:42;"- Whereas Jake finds the Chainsmokers palette to be--"
01:36:42;01:36:43;"- Brittle, acidic."
01:36:43;01:36:45;"- Not tasteful. - Dystopian."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"- Dystopian."
01:36:46;01:36:48;"- That's incredible."
01:36:48;01:36:53;"Their last, Chainsmokers' last song, ""Horrendous."""
01:36:53;01:36:56;"- ""Paris"" is the worst song I've ever heard in my life."
01:36:56;01:36:57;"- What's it called?"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"- ""Gone in Paris"" to get away from your parents."
01:36:59;01:37:00;"- Oh my God."
01:37:00;01:37:03;"- Okay, here's the question. - Keep that ""New Kids"" going."
01:37:03;01:37:05;"I wanna-- - Sorry, I--"
01:37:05;01:37:08;"- No, no, no, no, I wanna see where it goes."
01:37:08;01:37:10;"This is the most mild music."
01:37:10;01:37:11;"- And also, it's worth pointing out,"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"""New Kids on the Block"" was basically,"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"you know, Bobby Brown was a new edition,"
01:37:15;01:37:20;"which was a group of all black tweens,"
01:37:20;01:37:22;"and ""New Kids on the Block"" is all white tweens,"
01:37:22;01:37:25;"and I'm pretty sure they're both from Boston."
01:37:25;01:37:27;"- I thought ""New Edition"" was, really?"
01:37:27;01:37:28;"- No, no. - Okay, my bad."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"- Maybe you're thinking of Boyz II Men."
01:37:30;01:37:31;"""New Edition"" is also from Boston."
01:37:31;01:37:34;"And basically, ""New Kids on the Block"""
01:37:34;01:37:36;"was somebody looking at ""New Edition"""
01:37:36;01:37:39;"and saying, ""I'm gonna make a white version of that."""
01:37:39;01:37:40;"- Yikes."
01:37:40;01:37:41;"- And they did."
01:37:41;01:37:46;"We don't need to keep, this song is nothing."
01:37:46;01:37:49;"The ""New Kids"" had a couple gems, but not that one."
01:37:49;01:37:51;"- When did Mark Wahlberg last listen to that song?"
01:37:52;01:37:54;"- Well, Mark Wahlberg was not in it."
01:37:54;01:37:56;"His brother Donny. - I know, dude."
01:37:56;01:37:57;"I know."
01:37:57;01:38:00;"- I could imagine he had Donny over for a barbecue,"
01:38:00;01:38:03;"and he said to his wife, ""Put that 'New Kids' ballad"
01:38:03;01:38:05;"""on the Sonos."
01:38:05;01:38:07;"""I wanna bust Donny's balls."""
01:38:07;01:38:10;"- Summer 2009. (laughing)"
01:38:10;01:38:12;"- Yeah, July 4th, 2009."
01:38:12;01:38:16;"Donny was like-- - Everyone's sober."
01:38:16;01:38:17;"- Everyone's sober. (laughing)"
01:38:17;01:38:20;"- They're drinking. - They're drinking O'Doul's."
01:38:20;01:38:22;"- Donny's like, ""Hey, put on that new Kanye."
01:38:22;01:38:24;"""I like Kanye, you like Kanye, Mark?"
01:38:24;01:38:27;"""You still keeping up with rap?"""
01:38:27;01:38:28;"And he's like, ""Oh yeah."
01:38:28;01:38:30;"""One second, Donny, I'll put on some Kanye."""
01:38:30;01:38:33;"Then he says to his wife, ""But I'll be loving you forever"
01:38:33;01:38:35;"""on the Sonos, I wanna bust Donny's balls."""
01:38:35;01:38:39;"And then Donny's like, ""Wait, wait, what's this?"
01:38:39;01:38:42;"""Oh my God, still busting my balls, Mark,"
01:38:42;01:38:43;"""for all these years."""
01:38:43;01:38:47;"The number one song"
01:38:49;01:38:51;"in 2017."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"Increasingly, it seems that this song"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"is gonna define the summer."
01:38:55;01:38:57;"The first summer of Trump."
01:38:57;01:38:59;"I guess we could say there's some poetic justice"
01:38:59;01:39:01;"in that the first summer of Trump,"
01:39:01;01:39:04;"we have a mostly Spanish language song."
01:39:04;01:39:07;"That's cool."
01:39:07;01:39:08;"- Desperado? - That's awesome."
01:39:08;01:39:10;"- No, Despacito."
01:39:10;01:39:11;"And okay, so Kazzy, you were saying before,"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"Justin got in trouble."
01:39:13;01:39:14;"What's the story?"
01:39:14;01:39:16;"- He was like singing in a club."
01:39:16;01:39:19;"They gave him the mic to sing Despacito."
01:39:19;01:39:21;"And then he started to sing it."
01:39:21;01:39:23;"And then once it got to the Spanish verse,"
01:39:23;01:39:26;"he was like, ""La, la, la, la, la, la, la, burrito."""
01:39:26;01:39:28;"Like, it was so, it's so bad."
01:39:28;01:39:31;"Like, you watch it and you just can't stop laughing."
01:39:31;01:39:33;"It's like really bad."
01:39:33;01:39:34;"- And also, you know--"
01:39:34;01:39:36;"- So he just didn't remember the Spanish?"
01:39:36;01:39:36;"He like--"
01:39:36;01:39:38;"- No, he knows no Spanish."
01:39:38;01:39:39;"- He just never knew them."
01:39:39;01:39:41;"- But I thought he sang in Spanish in the song."
01:39:41;01:39:42;"- No, no, no, he sings in English."
01:39:42;01:39:44;"- No, he sings in Spanish."
01:39:44;01:39:47;"- So this was, I think also the fact that people,"
01:39:47;01:39:48;"yeah, people were like."
01:39:48;01:39:50;"(guitar music)"
01:39:50;01:39:51;"- Justin could have been--"
01:39:51;01:39:51;"- Great song."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"- You're in?"
01:39:53;01:39:54;"- Yeah, I'm in."
01:39:54;01:39:55;"- Okay, cool."
01:39:55;01:39:56;"- This is a good song."
01:39:56;01:39:58;"(guitar music)"
01:39:58;01:40:02;"- It's the king's English, man."
01:40:02;01:40:03;"- I think it switches."
01:40:03;01:40:06;"- I think he sings in Spanish, but he just learned it."
01:40:06;01:40:07;"He coached up."
01:40:07;01:40:10;"- He says one word in Spanish, the title of the song."
01:40:10;01:40:11;"- Okay."
01:40:11;01:40:12;"- That's not true."
01:40:12;01:40:14;"- Wait, what else does he say in Spanish?"
01:40:14;01:40:15;"- I think we need to listen."
01:40:15;01:40:18;"I remember him speaking Spanish in this."
01:40:18;01:40:21;"- So what's he supposed to do, though, in the club"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"when the Spanish part comes out?"
01:40:23;01:40:24;"- What he did."
01:40:24;01:40:26;"(guitar music)"
01:40:26;01:40:32;"- That's not Justin, though, obviously."
01:40:32;01:40:34;"As a professional musician, I can tell you guys,"
01:40:34;01:40:36;"that's not Justin singing anymore."
01:40:36;01:40:37;"I believe that's the response he--"
01:40:37;01:40:40;"- I think the chorus is more than that."
01:40:40;01:40:43;"The video's hilarious."
01:40:43;01:40:46;"(singing in Spanish)"
01:40:46;01:40:55;"- That's Justin."
01:40:55;01:40:56;"Oh, he's doubling the guy."
01:40:56;01:40:57;"Okay, you guys are right."
01:40:57;01:41:00;"The problem is that we wanna believe"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"that people from different countries can come together"
01:41:02;01:41:06;"to do hot remixes to become the songs of the summer,"
01:41:06;01:41:09;"and we wanna believe that there's mutual respect happening."
01:41:09;01:41:12;"I don't know, so just like making jokes"
01:41:12;01:41:15;"about, I guess he kept saying the phrase Dorito"
01:41:15;01:41:16;"when he was singing."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"- Yeah."
01:41:17;01:41:20;"- That's like some juvenile 22-year-old humor."
01:41:20;01:41:21;"- He wasn't joking."
01:41:21;01:41:23;"I think it was the only thing he could think of"
01:41:23;01:41:25;"that ended in O."
01:41:25;01:41:28;"- And as we know, Doritos are an American product,"
01:41:28;01:41:30;"so it's not even--"
01:41:30;01:41:32;"- Freed away."
01:41:32;01:41:34;"- Do you think this is the song of the summer, though?"
01:41:34;01:41:36;"- It seems like we have no choice."
01:41:36;01:41:37;"Is this your song of the summer?"
01:41:37;01:41:40;"- I thought ""Slide"" was gonna be the song of the summer."
01:41:40;01:41:41;"- What's that?"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"- Oh, Calvin Harris?"
01:41:42;01:41:43;"- ""Slide"" is pretty cool."
01:41:43;01:41:46;"- No, it's too cool to be the song of the summer."
01:41:46;01:41:46;"- Too cool?"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"- I like the other one with Ariana Grande, too."
01:41:48;01:41:49;"Is that what that's called?"
01:41:49;01:41:49;"- Which one?"
01:41:49;01:41:52;"- It's called ""Heat Wave"" or something."
01:41:52;01:41:54;"- Oh, I haven't heard that."
01:41:54;01:41:55;"- ""Despacito"" is the song of the summer."
01:41:55;01:41:57;"There's nothing that any of us can do about it."
01:41:57;01:41:59;"- It's been number one for a few weeks."
01:41:59;01:42:00;"- It's been number one."
01:42:00;01:42:00;"It's the song of the summer."
01:42:00;01:42:02;"- It's still early in the summer."
01:42:02;01:42:04;"- It's true."
01:42:04;01:42:05;"- It could change."
01:42:05;01:42:06;"- Get it done."
01:42:06;01:42:09;"- ""Lean On,"" was that not the song of the summer?"
01:42:09;01:42:10;"- It kinda was the song of the summer."
01:42:10;01:42:13;"- I guess it's different as a top one in your mind"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"what really the song of the summer is."
01:42:15;01:42:18;"- As I get older, the summer means nothing to me."
01:42:18;01:42:20;"Maybe just 'cause I've been in LA so much."
01:42:20;01:42:22;"It's like when people talk about it's June"
01:42:22;01:42:25;"and it's the beginning of summer."
01:42:25;01:42:27;"Who cares?"
01:42:27;01:42:29;"- I was back in DC last weekend."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"It felt like summer."
01:42:30;01:42:33;"- Just that humid East Coast?"
01:42:33;01:42:34;"- Oh, yeah."
01:42:34;01:42:37;"- So now that you're out of college,"
01:42:37;01:42:39;"does summer mean anything to you?"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"And you live in Los Angeles?"
01:42:41;01:42:44;"- This is my second summer since college."
01:42:44;01:42:47;"So I haven't really gotten there yet."
01:42:47;01:42:50;"Summer still is feeling like summer."
01:42:50;01:42:51;"- This is exciting."
01:42:51;01:42:53;"It's exciting that it's summer."
01:42:53;01:42:54;"- Yeah."
01:42:54;01:42:55;"- And when I was 23,"
01:42:55;01:42:57;"did I still get excited about the summer?"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"- I don't ever really get excited about anything,"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"but it's like, oh, summer."
01:43:01;01:43:03;"- But once or twice this summer,"
01:43:03;01:43:05;"you're gonna call up everybody,"
01:43:05;01:43:08;"jump in the car, go to Sweet Rose, blast ""Despacito."""
01:43:08;01:43:09;"- Totally."
01:43:09;01:43:09;"- That's gonna happen."
01:43:09;01:43:10;"- That's in my future, yes."
01:43:10;01:43:12;"- Do you go to clubs and dance?"
01:43:12;01:43:15;"- Like once a year,"
01:43:15;01:43:18;"and then I'm always like, I'm never doing that again."
01:43:18;01:43:20;"And then the next year I'll forget."
01:43:20;01:43:21;"- And do you hold things in your hand?"
01:43:21;01:43:22;"'Cause this is something we were talking about."
01:43:22;01:43:24;"- Yeah, I got, I'm like, will hold like-"
01:43:24;01:43:26;"- Double fists?"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"- That would be even more comfortable."
01:43:28;01:43:30;"I really try not to smoke."
01:43:30;01:43:33;"And when I'm like out, I just like, can't not do it."
01:43:33;01:43:36;"I feel so embarrassed even be out somewhere"
01:43:36;01:43:37;"that I have to be doing something."
01:43:37;01:43:38;"- Do you smoke cigarettes at the club?"
01:43:38;01:43:39;"- I really try not to."
01:43:39;01:43:42;"- You can't smoke in the club though, can you?"
01:43:42;01:43:42;"- No."
01:43:42;01:43:43;"- Maybe, I don't know, maybe you go underground."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"- I do sometimes, yeah."
01:43:45;01:43:47;"- Okay, so you're at the club, feeling uncomfortable"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"'cause you don't like to dance at the club."
01:43:49;01:43:49;"- Yeah."
01:43:49;01:43:50;"- So to make up for the discomfort,"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"you got a cigarette, lit cigarette in your mouth."
01:43:52;01:43:53;"- And a drink."
01:43:53;01:43:54;"- And a drink in each hand."
01:43:54;01:43:56;"- And I hate doing both those things."
01:43:56;01:43:59;"- And you're just kinda swaying, or you're doing moves?"
01:43:59;01:44:03;"- Yeah, I mean, sometimes I'll take a Xanax"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"if I have to go out."
01:44:04;01:44:05;"- Whoa."
01:44:05;01:44:07;"- Yeah, so I can just do it,"
01:44:07;01:44:11;"pretend to be someone else for a night."
01:44:11;01:44:13;"So I get sometimes comfortable enough"
01:44:13;01:44:17;"to dance like the other girls."
01:44:17;01:44:17;"- Right."
01:44:17;01:44:21;"- Yeah, but it's an embarrassing sight."
01:44:21;01:44:24;"If you walk in there sober, you're like, what is this?"
01:44:24;01:44:25;"What are we all doing?"
01:44:25;01:44:29;"- I feel like I need to definitely be lit, as they say."
01:44:29;01:44:30;"- Where are the clubs in LA?"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"- Like West Hollywood?"
01:44:33;01:44:35;"- Man, Nice Guy, Bootsy Bellows."
01:44:35;01:44:37;"- Are they on Sunset in West Hollywood?"
01:44:37;01:44:39;"- Bootsy Bellows is on Sunset, but it's like--"
01:44:39;01:44:42;"- Bootsy is so cracking, it's like--"
01:44:42;01:44:46;"- That's like a Models and Bottles club, club, billionaires."
01:44:46;01:44:50;"- Everyone has extensions, everyone's naked."
01:44:50;01:44:51;"Not actually naked, but--"
01:44:51;01:44:52;"- So, okay, okay, so--"
01:44:52;01:44:53;"- And that's also--"
01:44:53;01:44:54;"- Can I just roll in there?"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"Or is it the kinda thing that--"
01:44:56;01:44:59;"- You honestly, it's so hard to get in."
01:44:59;01:45:02;"I couldn't get in one time, the only time I went,"
01:45:02;01:45:03;"and it was so embarrassing,"
01:45:03;01:45:05;"and then everyone's just waiting outside,"
01:45:05;01:45:06;"'cause they all--"
01:45:06;01:45:07;"- Oh, because they're your friends in?"
01:45:07;01:45:08;"- Tried to go in, yeah."
01:45:08;01:45:10;"- Is it just based on a, is it like a TV show?"
01:45:10;01:45:12;"Is it like Sex and the City, where it's like,"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"there's a guy that's like judging you,"
01:45:14;01:45:15;"and then you can't get in?"
01:45:15;01:45:16;"- I think it's like, it's at the point"
01:45:16;01:45:19;"where you need a connection to someone"
01:45:19;01:45:21;"who has a table inside to get in the club."
01:45:21;01:45:22;"- I got two questions, did you consider"
01:45:22;01:45:23;"dropping your father's name?"
01:45:23;01:45:26;"And if you did, even if the guy was like,"
01:45:26;01:45:29;"just imagine like the guy at the door is a huge Curb fan,"
01:45:29;01:45:31;"and he's like, that's awesome, I love Curb,"
01:45:31;01:45:35;"I don't see the connection between coming to Bootsy Bellows."
01:45:35;01:45:36;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:45:36;01:45:38;"- Yeah, no, I would literally never do that."
01:45:38;01:45:41;"But one time my friend literally was like,"
01:45:41;01:45:44;"dropped it without asking, even though I don't know"
01:45:44;01:45:46;"why you would even ever do that."
01:45:46;01:45:49;"And they were like, I have no idea who the (beep) that is,"
01:45:49;01:45:50;"like, please."
01:45:50;01:45:51;"It was so, it was humiliating."
01:45:51;01:45:54;"- No, because the truth is, you can strike out"
01:45:54;01:45:57;"big league when you drop a name, because--"
01:45:57;01:45:59;"- You're really putting yourself out there."
01:45:59;01:46:00;"- You're really putting yourself out there."
01:46:00;01:46:01;"- It's awkward. - It is so awful."
01:46:01;01:46:03;"'Cause also you're making an assumption"
01:46:03;01:46:06;"about the other person, that even if you drop"
01:46:06;01:46:08;"like a sick name, like a great name"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"of a talented, amazing person--"
01:46:10;01:46:11;"- Dr. Dre."
01:46:11;01:46:14;"- Dr. Dre, you're also making the assumption--"
01:46:14;01:46:15;"- I'm rolling up in a polar fleece."
01:46:15;01:46:16;"- Yeah."
01:46:16;01:46:18;"- Because maybe that person is just like deeply--"
01:46:18;01:46:19;"- 40 year old white guy. - Ingalitarian."
01:46:19;01:46:21;"- But being, what you're saying is like,"
01:46:21;01:46:23;"you're saying like, it's the most--"
01:46:23;01:46:25;"- Honestly, I feel like this probably happened"
01:46:25;01:46:26;"on Curb Your Enthusiasm, it's also like,"
01:46:26;01:46:29;"you try to drop a name, 'cause maybe the person says,"
01:46:29;01:46:30;"I'm really sorry, we're full, and then you say,"
01:46:30;01:46:33;"well, blah, blah, blah, and then they might,"
01:46:33;01:46:34;"if it's very possible, they might be like,"
01:46:34;01:46:36;"that's great, but as I said, we're full."
01:46:36;01:46:37;"What are you trying to do here?"
01:46:37;01:46:39;"I mean, I don't know, what are you gonna say?"
01:46:39;01:46:40;"- I'm on Time Crisis."
01:46:40;01:46:41;"(static)"
01:46:41;01:46:46;"- You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
01:46:46;01:46:49;"- What's a cover at a club like that?"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"- What do you mean, the cover?"
01:46:51;01:46:52;"- Like the cover charge."
01:46:52;01:46:53;"- I think there is no cover."
01:46:53;01:46:53;"- Oh, no, no, no, there's no cover."
01:46:53;01:46:54;"- Probably not for women, right?"
01:46:54;01:46:55;"- Yeah, no."
01:46:55;01:46:57;"- Maybe for guys."
01:46:57;01:46:59;"- What about? (laughs)"
01:46:59;01:47:00;"- Well, because they make all their money"
01:47:00;01:47:01;"from bottle service, yeah."
01:47:01;01:47:03;"- What if you and I just tried to go to this club,"
01:47:03;01:47:04;"what's it called?"
01:47:04;01:47:05;"- Bootsy Bellows."
01:47:05;01:47:07;"- Okay, we tried to go there on a Saturday night,"
01:47:07;01:47:08;"just you and me."
01:47:08;01:47:10;"- Okay, and I'm not making any phone calls or anything?"
01:47:10;01:47:11;"- No, no, yeah, no phone calls."
01:47:11;01:47:12;"- Just showing off."
01:47:12;01:47:14;"- But we're dressed appropriately, we're like wearing"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"whatever, like a suit, whatever you're supposed to wear."
01:47:16;01:47:17;"- What time are you going?"
01:47:17;01:47:19;"- We're wearing going out shirts."
01:47:19;01:47:20;"- Yeah."
01:47:20;01:47:23;"I don't know, what's like 11.30 on a Saturday night?"
01:47:23;01:47:25;"- And we just get in line and wait,"
01:47:25;01:47:27;"we're gonna wait there all night, that's my gut."
01:47:27;01:47:28;"- Yeah."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"- Well, okay, okay."
01:47:29;01:47:30;"- We're not getting in."
01:47:30;01:47:32;"- What if the movie could make?"
01:47:32;01:47:35;"- The move we could make is, I would put out an APB,"
01:47:35;01:47:38;"I don't know, I'm honestly not sure."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"First I'd hit up my manager saying,"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"me and Jake really wanna go to Bootsy Bellows."
01:47:42;01:47:44;"- It's Jake's 41st birthday, he really wants to."
01:47:44;01:47:47;"- And he wants to go solo with me to Bootsy Bellows."
01:47:47;01:47:49;"I would hit up that, you know who I would hit up?"
01:47:49;01:47:51;"My trainer."
01:47:51;01:47:52;"- Oh, no way."
01:47:52;01:47:55;"- He's like a going out type guy, Fred."
01:47:55;01:47:56;"- He's into it."
01:47:56;01:48:00;"- I would text Fred like, Fred, two questions,"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"can you do 10.30 on Monday?"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"And also, can you get me in front of the Bootsy Bellows?"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"- That's a bit of a stretch."
01:48:06;01:48:11;"- People really, they'll say anything to get in."
01:48:11;01:48:12;"- For what?"
01:48:12;01:48:13;"- I've witnessed like crazy things."
01:48:13;01:48:15;"- So you've been once?"
01:48:15;01:48:16;"- To Bootsy?"
01:48:16;01:48:16;"- Yeah, Bootsy."
01:48:16;01:48:18;"- I know, I lied, I've been a few times."
01:48:18;01:48:19;"- I mean, you're calling it."
01:48:19;01:48:20;"- I've been like maybe three times."
01:48:20;01:48:22;"- You're calling it by just part of its name."
01:48:22;01:48:23;"- That's how you do it."
01:48:23;01:48:26;"- You're on a first name basis with Bootsy."
01:48:26;01:48:27;"- It's two Bs, it's a hard one."
01:48:27;01:48:29;"I have to stick with the one."
01:48:29;01:48:33;"No, people, yeah, I don't remember what I was saying."
01:48:33;01:48:35;"- People say the craziest things to get in."
01:48:35;01:48:37;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"And then there's like the times where like they're getting,"
01:48:39;01:48:42;"girls are getting kicked out and they can't speak"
01:48:42;01:48:43;"and they're still trying to get back in."
01:48:43;01:48:44;"- Oh, 'cause they're hammered?"
01:48:44;01:48:45;"Is that why they're getting kicked out?"
01:48:45;01:48:47;"- Please, everyone."
01:48:47;01:48:51;"- And when you go to these clubs,"
01:48:51;01:48:54;"they're super crowded, they're loud."
01:48:54;01:48:55;"- Yeah."
01:48:55;01:48:56;"- This is what's happening."
01:48:56;01:48:57;"So let's say we got in."
01:48:57;01:48:58;"- Are they playing the chain smokers?"
01:48:58;01:48:59;"- Yeah, let's just play this out."
01:48:59;01:49:02;"- They might, they might have a more tasteful DJ."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"But let's say we actually got in."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"It's me, you, and my trainer."
01:49:05;01:49:07;"- Can I come?"
01:49:07;01:49:08;"- Yeah."
01:49:08;01:49:08;"- Me, you, my trainer, and Kazzy."
01:49:08;01:49:09;"- Thank you."
01:49:09;01:49:10;"- It's the four of us rolling in."
01:49:10;01:49:12;"- She avoids dropping her father's name."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"- She avoids dropping her father's name."
01:49:14;01:49:17;"We get in, it was all about the trainer."
01:49:17;01:49:18;"He got us in."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"And then we're just in there."
01:49:20;01:49:23;"I'm like, you guys want a drink?"
01:49:23;01:49:24;"You're like, what man?"
01:49:24;01:49:26;"And I'm like, you want a drink?"
01:49:26;01:49:29;"And then you don't see me for 30 minutes."
01:49:29;01:49:31;"And then it's just like the three of you sit."
01:49:31;01:49:32;"Like literally, this is what happens."
01:49:32;01:49:34;"- Are we standing or are we trying to get a table?"
01:49:34;01:49:35;"- This is so accurate."
01:49:35;01:49:36;"- You're standing, kind of looking for a place."
01:49:36;01:49:39;"- Also like, good people are touching you."
01:49:39;01:49:41;"- Yeah, you're getting pushed by all these people."
01:49:41;01:49:42;"Like there's a lot of skin."
01:49:42;01:49:45;"People are just like, people are like treating you like dirt."
01:49:45;01:49:46;"- Are you dancing?"
01:49:46;01:49:47;"- Well, see here's the thing."
01:49:47;01:49:49;"- No, because you're not even in a place where you can dance"
01:49:49;01:49:52;"'cause we're in the entrance still"
01:49:52;01:49:53;"'cause it's so crowded."
01:49:53;01:49:54;"- Right."
01:49:54;01:49:56;"- We're on the perimeter of the thing."
01:49:56;01:49:57;"So I'm getting a drink."
01:49:57;01:49:59;"Like maybe my trainer's on the,"
01:49:59;01:50:01;"he's actually like having a good time."
01:50:01;01:50:03;"So then it's just you and Kazzy now."
01:50:03;01:50:03;"And then you're kind of like,"
01:50:03;01:50:05;"neither one of you are dancing that much."
01:50:05;01:50:07;"You're like, so yeah."
01:50:07;01:50:09;"You're trying to have a conversation like,"
01:50:09;01:50:11;"this is funny, what?"
01:50:11;01:50:11;"It's like crazy."
01:50:11;01:50:14;"- It's like, you can't talk, you can't dance"
01:50:14;01:50:15;"'cause it's like embarrassing."
01:50:15;01:50:16;"What are you gonna do?"
01:50:16;01:50:17;"- What are you dropping on those drinks?"
01:50:17;01:50:20;"You're getting drinks for you, me, Kazzy and the trainer."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"- It'll probably be $40."
01:50:22;01:50:23;"- Yeah, what do you want?"
01:50:23;01:50:24;"- That's it?"
01:50:24;01:50:24;"- No, it's gonna be more than 40."
01:50:24;01:50:26;"- Really? - What do you want?"
01:50:26;01:50:27;"- A vodka soda."
01:50:27;01:50:28;"- What do you want, Jake?"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"- Tequila on the rocks."
01:50:30;01:50:31;"- Okay."
01:50:31;01:50:32;"- Not Patron, like Well."
01:50:32;01:50:33;"- On Yeho?"
01:50:33;01:50:34;"- Well tequila. - Well tequila?"
01:50:34;01:50:35;"- Yeah. - All right."
01:50:35;01:50:37;"It's probably gonna be 13 each."
01:50:37;01:50:39;"- That's not terrible."
01:50:39;01:50:40;"- Maybe more, maybe like 15."
01:50:40;01:50:42;"- What's bottle service?"
01:50:42;01:50:42;"What is that?"
01:50:42;01:50:45;"- Bottle service is when you charge"
01:50:45;01:50:49;"for a bottle that would cost $40 at Costco,"
01:50:49;01:50:52;"you charge 12 to 1500."
01:50:52;01:50:53;"And occasionally--"
01:50:53;01:50:54;"- Solid markup."
01:50:54;01:50:55;"- So the way that clubs make money"
01:50:55;01:50:57;"is not from the schlubs like us,"
01:50:57;01:51:00;"pushing our way in to drop 100 bucks."
01:51:00;01:51:02;"It's by they give a table to somebody"
01:51:02;01:51:04;"who will bring out,"
01:51:04;01:51:06;"they bring out the champagne with sparklers on it,"
01:51:06;01:51:10;"and they might be like, order a fancy champagne."
01:51:10;01:51:12;"Maybe that, you know,"
01:51:12;01:51:13;"get the occasional person in Bootsy Bellows"
01:51:13;01:51:16;"who probably single-handedly drops $50,000."
01:51:16;01:51:17;"That probably happens every weekend."
01:51:17;01:51:19;"- Worth it. - A couple times."
01:51:19;01:51:20;"It's worth it."
01:51:20;01:51:20;"So we're just in there,"
01:51:20;01:51:22;"packed like sardines. - It's worth it."
01:51:22;01:51:22;"- I just like come,"
01:51:22;01:51:25;"we're just like awkwardly drinking these things,"
01:51:25;01:51:26;"kind of dancing,"
01:51:26;01:51:28;"but we don't even have room to dance."
01:51:28;01:51:30;"And then best case scenario,"
01:51:30;01:51:33;"we see Leonardo DiCaprio sitting on the top"
01:51:33;01:51:38;"of one of the benches in a booth."
01:51:38;01:51:39;"That's it, kind of."
01:51:39;01:51:40;"- Best case."
01:51:40;01:51:41;"- That's best case scenario."
01:51:41;01:51:42;"- No, he would never be there."
01:51:42;01:51:44;"It would be more like someone like,"
01:51:44;01:51:47;"I once saw Chase Crawford there."
01:51:47;01:51:50;"That's like the most famous person I've seen at a club."
01:51:50;01:51:51;"I like a Bootsy club."
01:51:51;01:51:53;"- Maybe Drake has been to Bootsy Bellows."
01:51:53;01:51:54;"I mean, that's like, yeah, maybe not everything."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"- Really?"
01:51:55;01:51:56;"- Yeah. - I guess I don't."
01:51:56;01:51:59;"I feel like Leo is like so past the club scene."
01:51:59;01:52:01;"Maybe he just hasn't been single in a while."
01:52:01;01:52:03;"- I've seen Leo at art openings."
01:52:03;01:52:04;"- Oh yeah? - Oh yeah."
01:52:04;01:52:06;"- That's more a scene. - So you already saw Leo."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"You already saw Leo."
01:52:07;01:52:08;"It's not gonna be fun."
01:52:08;01:52:11;"- 50 grand?"
01:52:11;01:52:15;"More than like a public school teacher's salary for a year."
01:52:15;01:52:18;"- Yeah, man. - On like champagne."
01:52:18;01:52:18;"- I've been trying to tell you, man."
01:52:18;01:52:19;"- And like nachos."
01:52:19;01:52:22;"- The millionaires and the billionaires"
01:52:22;01:52:24;"are out having fun at Bootsy Bellows"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"while the average American."
01:52:26;01:52:28;"- That's why the terrorists hate us."
01:52:28;01:52:30;"- Yeah, I mean, it's not a good look."
01:52:30;01:52:31;"- It's a terrible look."
01:52:31;01:52:33;"- And then like, so then we're in there for a while."
01:52:33;01:52:34;"- I just don't understand."
01:52:34;01:52:39;"Even if I had like $80 million in my checking account,"
01:52:39;01:52:42;"I still can't conceive of like dropping 50K."
01:52:42;01:52:43;"- But they don't even know how much"
01:52:43;01:52:46;"they're gonna be spending until after the bill comes"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"because they'll keep bringing bottles"
01:52:48;01:52:50;"of girls at their table are like drinking."
01:52:50;01:52:54;"If they drink more, there's like 20 people at the table."
01:52:54;01:52:55;"All the drinks will be gone."
01:52:55;01:52:57;"So then they'll keep bringing drinks."
01:52:57;01:52:59;"- They literally might have a friend cruising around"
01:52:59;01:53:02;"to get like all the hot girls to come sit at the table."
01:53:02;01:53:03;"- But then they end up paying more."
01:53:03;01:53:05;"- This must happen where some guy's not loaded."
01:53:05;01:53:06;"Some guy's fronting when he's loaded."
01:53:06;01:53:08;"- It happens all the time."
01:53:08;01:53:11;"- And then he's just like rolling with the momentum."
01:53:11;01:53:14;"And then the bill comes and it's like 34,000"
01:53:14;01:53:17;"and he's got like 60 bucks in his checking account."
01:53:17;01:53:19;"Like how does that play out?"
01:53:19;01:53:20;"- I don't know."
01:53:20;01:53:22;"Maybe they just like, they beat him up."
01:53:22;01:53:24;"- What?"
01:53:24;01:53:25;"Cool business plan."
01:53:25;01:53:27;"- You try to split it with like everyone"
01:53:27;01:53:28;"who's at the table."
01:53:28;01:53:30;"Everyone would be so confused."
01:53:30;01:53:32;"No one's ever had to split anything before."
01:53:32;01:53:36;"- Debit cards, just like 16 different debit cards"
01:53:36;01:53:38;"at like 2.15 in the morning."
01:53:38;01:53:41;"Everyone's putting like 1200 bucks on a debit card."
01:53:41;01:53:42;"- Oh God."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"Yeah, that's best case scenario."
01:53:44;01:53:46;"Then we're walking out of there at 2 AM."
01:53:47;01:53:48;"Ears ringing."
01:53:48;01:53:51;"- You hungry?"
01:53:51;01:53:54;"- Yeah, then we're going to Mel's."
01:53:54;01:53:58;"Just get a cheeseburger at Mel's."
01:53:58;01:53:59;"Yeah, I don't get it."
01:53:59;01:54:00;"- Crazy."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"- And it's not fun."
01:54:02;01:54:02;"- It's not fun."
01:54:02;01:54:06;"And I think even like, even people who love to dance,"
01:54:06;01:54:07;"that's not where they wanna go."
01:54:07;01:54:09;"That's not where you're gonna have a good time."
01:54:09;01:54:11;"We should start at a club night."
01:54:11;01:54:12;"I think it'd be a good way"
01:54:12;01:54:14;"to make some off the books money."
01:54:14;01:54:15;"I bet there's a lot of people in LA."
01:54:15;01:54:16;"- That's a really good idea."
01:54:16;01:54:17;"- Oh, like a time crisis club night?"
01:54:17;01:54:19;"- We should do a time crisis club night"
01:54:19;01:54:21;"for people who don't like the chain smokers"
01:54:21;01:54:24;"and wanna dance to the more tasteful palette of 70s rock."
01:54:24;01:54:25;"- What's our venue?"
01:54:25;01:54:26;"Like an all ages club?"
01:54:26;01:54:27;"- I'll find some place."
01:54:27;01:54:31;"And then we're doing a $20 Modelo's."
01:54:31;01:54:34;"- Still not chill."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"- And the night will be called $20 Modelo."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"It'll be like a thing."
01:54:37;01:54:39;"It'll be kind of fun."
01:54:39;01:54:40;"We even like slap a sticker on it"
01:54:40;01:54:41;"so you can do an Instagram"
01:54:41;01:54:43;"like a view of your $20 Modelo."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"- I think we do free beer, dude."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"- Free beer?"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"- I think we throw like a kegger."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"- So you're gonna have just guys in there."
01:54:49;01:54:50;"- This is it."
01:54:50;01:54:51;"Okay, you're right."
01:54:51;01:54:54;"- We really need to widen the attraction."
01:54:54;01:54:56;"- Okay, this is a good idea."
01:54:56;01:54:57;"I'm glad we had this brainstorming,"
01:54:57;01:55:00;"this brainstorm sesh."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"Time crisis club night."
01:55:01;01:55:02;"- I'm in."
01:55:02;01:55:05;"- We gotta do one club night"
01:55:05;01:55:09;"to get Jake's guitar out of the pawn shop"
01:55:09;01:55:13;"so that he can rip a solo on the Vampire Weekend album."
01:55:13;01:55:15;"That's the plot."
01:55:15;01:55:15;"- Love it."
01:55:15;01:55:18;"- Jake had to pawn his beloved Strat."
01:55:18;01:55:21;"We gotta throw one sick club night to get it unpawned."
