00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis, July 4th weekend, all-American edition."
00:06;00:11;"We're doing something very special for this holiday weekend version of Time Crisis."
00:11;00:15;"Jake and I are going to count down all 50 states."
00:15;00:20;"With the help of Billboard's list of the most important artists representing each state,"
00:20;00:26;"we will explore America through its music, its artistry, and its heritage."
00:26;00:30;"This is an all-American..."
00:30;00:33;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:33;00:38;"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Spoiler One."
00:38;00:44;"They pass me by, all of those great romances."
00:44;00:51;"They were our friends who were believing in my rightful chances."
00:51;00:58;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt to the floor when the bus had to go."
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:10;01:13;"Alright, Time Crisis. Welcome back, Jake."
01:13;01:14;"Hey."
01:14;01:15;"How you doing, man?"
01:15;01:16;"Good."
01:16;01:18;"So it's July 3rd. You know what that means."
01:18;01:20;"Fourth of July is tomorrow."
01:20;01:22;"You know what I know? A weird thing that I know."
01:22;01:23;"What's that?"
01:23;01:25;"Today is Tom Cruise's birthday."
01:25;01:29;"So Tom Cruise, who was in a movie called Born on the Fourth of July,"
01:29;01:31;"was born on the third of July."
01:31;01:32;"That is funny."
01:32;01:35;"Because my buddy Wes had a July 3rd birthday."
01:35;01:38;"And Tom Cruise also went to my high school in Glenridge, New Jersey."
01:38;01:40;"So it's endless."
01:40;01:43;"I was going to say, I thought there was a North Jersey connection there."
01:43;01:47;"But more importantly, besides Tom Cruise, it is the day before Fourth of July."
01:47;01:51;"This is a global radio station that we broadcast on."
01:51;01:55;"Got people listening in literally every country on earth."
01:55;01:56;"Really?"
01:56;01:58;"At least they have the potential to."
01:58;02:01;"A lot of them. A lot of them."
02:01;02:06;"So we're going to do a kind of America-centric show today."
02:06;02:08;"Because even though we've got listeners from all over the world,"
02:08;02:10;"July 4th is a major American holiday."
02:10;02:11;"Independence Day."
02:11;02:14;"Independence Day for people out there who don't know."
02:14;02:19;"Declaration of Independence was signed in Philadelphia July 4th, 1776."
02:19;02:24;"For anybody who doesn't know, America was colonized by the British"
02:24;02:27;"through a series of land deals."
02:27;02:29;"It was the young upstart."
02:29;02:30;"It was the young upstart."
02:30;02:33;"Look, there was a lot of horrible things happened,"
02:33;02:35;"some intra-European squabbling."
02:35;02:43;"But basically, 1776, the original 13 colonies were still belonging to King George."
02:43;02:44;"Yep."
02:44;02:45;"How am I doing here?"
02:45;02:49;"All right, King George of the UK and a bunch of Americans got together"
02:49;02:50;"and said, ""Enough of that."""
02:50;02:51;"Enough of this."
02:51;02:55;"So, you know, it's a good time to reflect on American history"
02:55;02:58;"and what it means to be American."
02:58;03:00;"And because this is a music show,"
03:00;03:03;"I thought we would spend the entire show going through"
03:03;03:05;"some of America's greatest artists."
03:05;03:07;"And, you know, there's a lot of different ways we could do that,"
03:07;03:10;"but the easiest way would probably be just to go through this list"
03:10;03:15;"that Billboard made, which is the 50 greatest artists from the 50 greatest states."
03:15;03:18;"The 50 greatest artists from the 50 states."
03:18;03:20;"So one artist per state."
03:20;03:21;"One artist per state."
03:21;03:24;"And I don't know Billboard's exact methodology,"
03:24;03:28;"but I assume it probably has something to do with sales."
03:28;03:30;"Given that it's Billboard."
03:30;03:31;"Given that it's Billboard."
03:31;03:33;"And I believe the way they did it, they went through every state"
03:33;03:37;"and they looked at the--I think, like, the artist had to be born in the state."
03:37;03:39;"Okay."
03:39;03:40;"That's my understanding."
03:40;03:41;"Okay."
03:41;03:46;"So, for instance, I imagine Michael Jackson would count for Indiana."
03:46;03:47;"Right."
03:47;03:49;"And not California."
03:49;03:50;"Right."
03:50;03:51;"Or whatever."
03:51;03:53;"That's probably pretty common for California."
03:53;03:55;"Artists are born elsewhere."
03:55;03:57;"You know, Tom Petty's born in Florida."
03:57;03:58;"Right."
03:58;04:00;"But makes his career in California."
04:00;04:03;"I definitely associate Tom Petty with L.A."
04:03;04:04;"Right."
04:04;04:07;"I mean, yeah, I'm trying to think if I know anyone's like that off the top of my head."
04:07;04:09;"People are, like, born somewhere weird."
04:09;04:11;"Or all the Eagles were born elsewhere."
04:11;04:12;"Right."
04:12;04:13;"You become more associated with something."
04:13;04:16;"You know, I was trying to think of an example of somebody born somewhere,"
04:16;04:19;"but then they become more associated with a different place."
04:19;04:21;"I mean, there's, like, a lot--New York, too."
04:21;04:22;"Sure."
04:22;04:23;"Like, Richard Hells from Ohio."
04:23;04:26;"But actually, this is only tangentially related."
04:26;04:28;"The first thing I thought of is one of my favorite facts"
04:28;04:32;"is that Robert De Niro's only a quarter Italian."
04:32;04:35;"It's definitely not the same thing, but you see--you know what I mean?"
04:35;04:36;"Yeah."
04:36;04:39;"He's three quarters other stuff, but because he got the Italian last name"
04:39;04:45;"as, like, a quarter, and because of his collaborations with Scorsese--"
04:45;04:48;"you know, he's so associated with Italian-American culture."
04:48;04:49;"Right."
04:49;04:50;"He's only ethnically a quarter Italian."
04:50;04:51;"I did not know that."
04:51;04:53;"Well, that's America for you."
04:53;04:56;"Yeah, that's a good example of the American melting pot."
04:56;04:57;"So you ready to get into this, man?"
04:57;04:58;"Yeah, let's do it."
04:58;05:00;"All right, we're going to go through it alphabetically."
05:00;05:01;"Great."
05:01;05:04;"So we're going to start with the great state of Alabama."
05:04;05:07;"Who do you think is the biggest artist from Alabama?"
05:07;05:10;"Well, I know Skinner is from Florida,"
05:10;05:13;"because I was thinking Sweet Home Alabama initially."
05:13;05:14;"Oh, Skinner's not from Alabama."
05:14;05:15;"No, they're from Florida."
05:15;05:16;"This is a weird one."
05:16;05:18;"This is a band I've heard about my whole life."
05:18;05:21;"It also shows how divided America is."
05:21;05:25;"I know that this is a massive, like, massive band,"
05:25;05:28;"but I don't really know any of their songs."
05:28;05:32;"It's like so--was a little not part of my culture growing up."
05:32;05:33;"Is it Alabama?"
05:33;05:34;"It's Alabama."
05:34;05:37;"So the biggest artist from Alabama is Alabama."
05:37;05:38;"As if its name isn't enough,"
05:38;05:43;"the band Alabama has banked 33 hot country song number ones."
05:43;05:45;"We're just going to play a song from each artist."
05:45;05:48;"This is Alabama's song called ""Tennessee River."""
05:48;05:51;"Presumably one of their big hits."
05:51;05:54;"I know they had a big--like a bunch of early '80s,"
05:54;05:55;"late '70s country hits."
05:55;05:58;"Yeah, this is from 1980."
05:58;06:00;"I like it so far."
06:00;06:05;"I was born across the river"
06:05;06:09;"In the mountains where I call home"
06:09;06:12;"Lord, time was good there"
06:12;06:19;"Don't know why I ever wrong"
06:19;06:25;"Oh, Tennessee River and the mountain bands"
06:25;06:29;"We get together anytime we can"
06:29;06:34;"Oh, Tennessee River and the mountain bands"
06:34;06:39;"We play together in mother nature's band"
06:39;06:49;"[saxophone solo]"
06:49;06:54;"Me and my warm hearts done made our plans"
06:54;06:59;"On the Tennessee River walking hand in hand"
06:59;07:04;"Gonna raise a family and Lord settle down"
07:04;07:09;"Where peace and love can still be found"
07:09;07:14;"Oh, Tennessee River and the mountain bands"
07:14;07:19;"We get together anytime we can"
07:19;07:24;"Oh, Tennessee River and the mountain bands"
07:24;07:29;"We play together in mother nature's band"
07:29;07:33;"Oh, Tennessee River"
07:33;07:38;"That was the biggest band from Alabama, Alabama,"
07:38;07:40;"with their song ""Tennessee River,"""
07:40;07:43;"from the album ""My Home's in Alabama."""
07:43;07:45;"Tripling down on Alabama."
07:45;07:46;"Tripling down."
07:46;07:48;"So congrats to Alabama."
07:48;07:50;"You're the first state in the alphabet."
07:50;07:53;"Okay, after Alabama comes Alaska."
07:53;07:54;"Jewel."
07:54;07:55;"Hey, good guess."
07:55;07:58;"Jewel is the biggest artist from Alaska."
07:58;07:59;"She was born in Utah."
07:59;08:02;"Okay, so maybe we're not going by birth."
08:02;08:03;"We're going with association."
08:03;08:06;"She was born in Utah, but her family soon moved"
08:06;08:07;"to Homer, Alaska,"
08:07;08:09;"in a home without indoor plumbing."
08:09;08:11;"I remember, like, when she came out in the '90s,"
08:11;08:14;"the big narrative was that she lived in her car."
08:14;08:15;"Up there?"
08:15;08:16;"I don't know, but you remember,"
08:16;08:17;"that was like a thing."
08:17;08:18;"It was like Jewel had been homeless."
08:18;08:21;"I wonder where she got her start, though, professionally."
08:21;08:23;"Probably just some Anchorage coffee houses."
08:23;08:24;"What?"
08:24;08:27;"And there's, like, some A&R guy from Aristas up there,"
08:27;08:32;"like, on a cruise, and he docks and goes in for the day."
08:32;08:34;"I think that's exactly what happened."
08:34;08:35;"And she's pretty good."
08:35;08:37;"Wow, this is really evocative for me."
08:37;08:38;"Very '70s."
08:38;08:40;"This is, like, mid-'90s here."
08:40;08:42;"This is '96."
08:42;08:43;"Jesus."
08:43;08:45;"Oh, here's a fun fact."
08:45;08:49;"Apparently the original lyrics to this were so brutal"
08:49;08:53;"that Atlantic Records had her re-record the song"
08:53;08:56;"for a more radio-friendly version."
08:56;08:58;"That's integrity for you."
08:58;09:01;"I wonder what the brutal ones were."
09:01;09:04;"♪ You were meant for me"
09:04;09:09;"♪ And I was meant for you"

09:43;09:50;"♪ Was so bad 'cause dreams last so long"
09:50;09:54;"♪ Hey, after you're gone"
09:54;09:56;"That was Jewel with ""You Were Meant For Me,"""
09:56;09:58;"biggest artist out of Alaska."
09:58;10:02;"Maybe biggest person out of Alaska until Sarah Palin."
10:02;10:03;"Interesting claim."
10:03;10:04;"Interesting."
10:04;10:06;"Alaska produces a lot of strong women."
10:06;10:07;"Yeah."
10:07;10:08;"Speaking of strong women,"
10:08;10:11;"who do you think is the biggest artist out of Arizona?"
10:11;10:12;"I don't know."
10:12;10:13;"It's a woman."
10:13;10:15;"She, like many people, moved to California"
10:15;10:16;"to kickstart her music career."
10:16;10:18;"She's very associated with California."
10:18;10:19;"Not Joanie."
10:20;10:21;"No, Joanie's Canadian."
10:21;10:23;"I'm not gonna talk about Canadian artists today."
10:23;10:25;"This is July 3rd."
10:25;10:26;"Give me a hint."
10:26;10:28;"I can't believe you don't know this, man."
10:28;10:31;"Strong female, born and raised in Arizona,"
10:31;10:34;"moved to California, the Bay Area,"
10:34;10:37;"meets a young knucklehead that she dates,"
10:37;10:38;"Okay, Stevie?"
10:38;10:39;"Stevie, yeah."
10:39;10:41;"I thought she was from the Bay Area."
10:41;10:42;"No, man."
10:42;10:44;"Stevie Nicks is from Arizona."
10:44;10:46;"That's not crucial to her bio."
10:46;10:47;"I don't know, man."
10:47;10:48;"Maybe it is."
10:48;10:50;"I thought it would be the Meat Puppets, maybe."
10:50;10:52;"The Meat Puppets."
10:52;10:54;"The Meat Puppets, man, Arizona."
10:54;10:56;"Biggest artist out of Arizona?"
10:56;10:57;"When I think of Arizona music,"
10:57;10:58;"I think of the Meat Puppets."
10:58;10:59;"Okay, well, now you should start--"
10:59;11:01;"People out there in Midewind are feeling me on that."
11:01;11:03;"I know it."
11:03;11:06;"They had, like, a mild hit in the mid-'90s"
11:06;11:10;"after Nirvana covered all their songs on Play."
11:10;11:13;"Yeah, well, I know, I'll do respect to the Meat Puppets."
11:13;11:14;"The Meat Puppets."
11:14;11:15;"They did their thing."
11:15;11:17;"We're gonna listen to ""Edge of Seventeen."""

14:56;15:00;"So, like, Barack Obama Sr. had eight children."
15:00;15:02;"There are some in Kenya, some in America."
15:02;15:04;"So actually, like, just reading about this,"
15:04;15:08;"like, after Barack Sr. and Obama's mom split up,"
15:08;15:12;"then he married a Jewish woman in Massachusetts"
15:12;15:14;"and had two more kids."
15:14;15:16;"So there are these, like, half-Jewish,"
15:16;15:18;"half-Kenyan Obama dudes,"
15:18;15:21;"but one of them died in a motorcycle accident."
15:21;15:23;"But so he has all these, like, half-siblings."
15:23;15:25;"Then he has this, like, sibling, George Obama,"
15:25;15:27;"who lives in Kenya, who's always, like,"
15:27;15:29;"talking shit about him."
15:29;15:31;"Really?"
15:31;15:33;"But he barely knew any of these people."
15:33;15:35;"Oh."
15:35;15:37;"But there's a lot of Obamas."
15:37;15:39;"That's trippy."
15:39;15:41;"Yeah."
15:41;15:43;"Who do you think's the biggest artist out of California?"
15:43;15:45;"Or who do you think Billboard chose"
15:45;15:47;"as the biggest artist out of California?"
15:47;15:49;"Is it somebody from Downey?"
15:49;15:51;"Torrance. Torrance? Yeah."
15:51;15:53;"I've never been to Torrance. What's it like?"
15:53;15:55;"I haven't really either."
15:55;15:57;"A mix of residential and commercial."
15:57;15:59;"[laughs]"
15:59;16:01;"Light industrial."
16:01;16:05;"What do you think the population is, about 150?"
16:05;16:07;"That's a pretty good guess."
16:07;16:09;"I'd say... What's your guess?"
16:09;16:12;"Eh, 200. 200?"
16:12;16:14;"You know who else is from Torrance"
16:14;16:17;"The Mark Wahlberg character in Boogie Nights,"
16:17;16:19;"Eddie Adams. Oh, really?"
16:19;16:21;"He takes the bus from Torrance up to Reseda."
16:21;16:23;"Wow. And then he becomes Dirk Dikler."
16:23;16:25;"Population of Torrance..."
16:25;16:27;"147."
16:27;16:29;"Oh, you were right on the money."
16:29;16:32;"I wonder what Torrance was like in the early '60s."
16:32;16:35;"Quiet, small,"
16:35;16:37;"citrus groves everywhere."
16:37;16:41;"# She's somehow closer now"
16:41;16:46;"# Softly smile, I know she must be kind"
16:46;16:53;"# When I look in her eyes"
16:53;16:57;"# She goes with me to a blossom world"
16:57;17:04;"# I'm picking up good vibrations"
17:04;17:07;"# She's giving me the excitations"
17:07;17:10;"# I'm popping off good vibrations"
17:10;17:13;"# Bop, bop, good vibrations"
17:13;17:17;"# Bop, bop, good vibrations"
17:17;17:20;"# Bop, bop, good vibrations"
17:26;17:29;"That was the Beach Boys with ""Good Vibrations""."
17:29;17:32;"The bunch of brothers out of Torrance, California."
17:32;17:35;"Shout-out to California, a major force in music."
17:35;17:38;"Yeah, I feel like we're almost shortchanging a lot of people."
17:38;17:41;"So many heavyweights came out of California."
17:41;17:42;"True."
17:42;17:44;"What's interesting about the Beach Boys,"
17:44;17:46;"they're born and bred California dudes"
17:46;17:50;"who exported California culture to the rest of the world."
17:50;17:54;"I guess maybe Jan and Dean did the same thing, but..."
17:54;17:56;"Later, Dr. Dre."
17:56;17:58;"And Dr. Dre, born and bred."
17:58;18:00;"Inglewood's not far from Torrance."
18:00;18:01;"Really?"
18:01;18:02;"Yeah."
18:02;18:04;"Yeah, I mean, when you think about it,"
18:04;18:07;"N.W.A. and Dr. Dre were kind of like the next Beach Boys."
18:07;18:08;"Yeah."
18:08;18:11;"'Cause all that '70s stuff, like Joni and Crosby, Stills & Nash,"
18:11;18:14;"those are all outsiders, half those people are Canadian."
18:14;18:16;"No disrespect to Canadians, but whatever,"
18:16;18:19;"there's carpetbaggers moving down in California."
18:19;18:22;"Born and bred, true Southern California people."
18:22;18:25;"Maybe also Brad from Sublime."
18:25;18:27;"OK, yeah, no, another iconic--"
18:27;18:29;"You know what I mean? Like true California culture."
18:29;18:30;"Absolutely."
18:30;18:34;"I would say Beach Boys, Eagles, Sublime,"
18:34;18:37;"and then N.W.A./Dr. Dre."
18:37;18:38;"Yeah, but Eagles aren't from California."
18:38;18:42;"No, I know, but in terms of exporting iconic California imagery and culture,"
18:42;18:43;"they're right there."
18:43;18:47;"Beach Boys, Eagles, Sublime, early '90s rap."
18:47;18:49;"And then now, like, the next wave."
18:49;18:51;"Kendrick, Vince Staples,"
18:51;18:54;"these are guys who are actually from Southern California."
18:54;18:57;"Colorado, a great state."
18:57;18:59;"You could smoke weed legally there."
18:59;19:02;"Now you can just walk down on Main Street in Aspen,"
19:02;19:06;"you could walk into a fancy weed boutique."
19:06;19:08;"You have to show your ID to show you're over 18."
19:08;19:11;"There's one called--I think it's Silver Ridge or Silver Peak."
19:11;19:12;"Shout out to them."
19:12;19:15;"And you walk in, and it's just like going into an Apple store,"
19:15;19:17;"except everything's weed."
19:17;19:20;"And the packaging for these weed alchoids"
19:20;19:22;"look like something you buy in CVS."
19:22;19:24;"Like glossy info."
19:24;19:25;"Edibles."
19:25;19:28;"Yeah, edibles, all sorts of stuff."
19:28;19:31;"Different chocolate, and then you can also just buy weed there."
19:31;19:33;"But that's what's good, that it's legal now,"
19:33;19:37;"'cause maybe now you can, like, know what you're getting a little more."
19:37;19:40;"# Colorado, Rocky Mountain High #"
19:40;19:41;"John Denver."
19:41;19:44;"Good guess, he's the Colorado artist."
19:44;19:47;"Although we were gonna play ""Take Me Home, Country Roads."""
19:47;19:49;"Oh yeah, this song is incredible."
19:49;19:51;"So John Denver's from Colorado."
19:51;19:53;"# Almost heaven #"
19:53;19:55;"Oh, it's a beautiful song."
19:55;19:57;"# West Virginia #"
19:57;19:59;"Have you ever heard that urban legend"
19:59;20:02;"that John Denver was a sniper in Vietnam?"
20:02;20:03;"No, is that true?"
20:03;20:04;"That's actually not true."
20:04;20:07;"But it was, like, such an incredible urban legend,"
20:07;20:11;"'cause writing the most vacuous, empty, optimistic music,"
20:11;20:14;"like some sort of therapy to work through his--"
20:14;20:15;"American sniper."
20:15;20:16;"Yeah."
20:16;20:20;"Just imagine, he's, like, out in the jungle in Vietnam,"
20:20;20:21;"smell the napalm,"
20:21;20:26;"and he's just, like, driving down, like, a North Vietnamese country road,"
20:26;20:28;"and he just starts thinking about, like, America."
20:28;20:29;"Right."
20:29;20:30;"He's like, ""What am I doing here?"""
20:30;20:32;"Wait, so he's--it's funny, so he's from Colorado,"
20:32;20:34;"but he's always thinking about West Virginia?"
20:34;20:35;"Yeah, that's true."
20:35;20:36;"What's up with that?"
20:36;20:39;"This song is the official state anthem of West Virginia."
20:39;20:42;"It probably just sang well, like, the syllables lined up."
20:42;20:45;"You think John Denver's ever drank moonshine?"
20:45;20:46;"Yeah."
20:46;20:47;"Yeah?"
20:47;20:48;"Yeah, I bet so."
20:48;20:49;"Have you drank moonshine?"
20:49;20:50;"No."
20:50;20:51;"Why would he have drank moonshine?"
20:51;20:53;"Eh, like, he's hanging out in some weird rural place"
20:53;20:56;"in, like, the '60s, early '70s."
20:56;20:57;"Sure."
20:57;21:02;"He's playing, like, a weird show in, like, 1969 somewhere."
21:02;21:03;"Possibly."
21:06;21:14;"♪ Take me home to the place I belong ♪"
21:14;21:20;"♪ West Virginia, my, my, my ♪"
21:20;21:27;"♪ Take me home, country roads ♪"
21:27;21:29;"That was John Denver with ""Take Me Home, Country Roads."""
21:29;21:30;"Great song."
21:30;21:34;"Colorado man with an odd fixation on West Virginia."
21:34;21:36;"Next state up is Connecticut."
21:36;21:37;"That's your home state, Jake."
21:37;21:38;"Hell yeah."
21:38;21:39;"So you must know off the top of your head"
21:39;21:41;"some of the great Connecticut musicians."
21:41;21:43;"Rivers Cuomo is from Connecticut."
21:43;21:44;"Rivers Cuomo Weezers."
21:44;21:47;"David Longstreth of Dirty Projectors is from--"
21:47;21:49;"Major Connecticut musician."
21:49;21:50;"Absolutely."
21:50;21:53;"I feel like Thurston Moore might have some CT roots."
21:53;21:54;"Oh, yeah, Moby."
21:54;21:55;"Oh, yeah."
21:55;21:56;"Moby is a real Connecticut dude."
21:56;21:59;"Avant-garde composer Charles Ives."
21:59;22:00;"Oh, right."
22:00;22:03;"Obviously, the CTHC scene was full on."
22:03;22:05;"Yeah, some hardcore bands."
22:05;22:06;"Not Billboard."
22:06;22:07;"Yeah, not Billboard stuff."
22:07;22:09;"You're missing the big one, though."
22:09;22:10;"I know it is."
22:10;22:11;"Mayer."
22:11;22:12;"Yep, Mayer."
22:12;22:13;"John Mayer."
22:13;22:15;"Couldn't be more appropriate, actually."
22:15;22:17;"Changed the face of the Connecticut music scene forever."
22:17;22:19;"He's from Fairfield, which is like Fairfield County,"
22:19;22:20;"southwest corner."
22:20;22:22;"So what does that make you think of?"
22:22;22:26;"It makes me think of, like, iBankers that work in New York,"
22:26;22:28;"you know, that live in, like, Stanford."
22:28;22:30;"It's like rich, bougie suburbs."
22:30;22:32;"Fairfield County, the southwest corner of Connecticut,"
22:32;22:36;"is the part of the state that establishes the reputation that carries on"
22:36;22:37;"in the popular imagination."
22:37;22:41;"Because that's, like, a very Tony, very waspy,"
22:41;22:43;"very wealthy part of the state."
22:43;22:47;"A lot of the state is sort of just, like, burned-out, old,"
22:47;22:51;"formerly prosperous industrial cities, like Waterbury."
22:51;22:53;"A lot of, like, random suburbs."
22:53;22:55;"Right, there's some rough parts of Connecticut."
22:55;22:58;"But I love that Mayer is the representative of Connecticut."
22:58;23:01;"It conforms to the, like, reputation of the state."
23:01;23:06;"Billboard says that they were torn between giving Connecticut to John Mayer"
23:06;23:07;"or Michael Bolton."
23:07;23:11;"[laughs]"
23:11;23:13;"Connecticut, very random place."
23:13;23:15;"Yeah, Bolton's from New Haven."
23:15;23:17;"Connecticut is truly random."
23:17;23:19;"Connecticut's a deeply random state."
23:19;23:20;"I wish they went with Bolton."
23:20;23:21;"Really?"
23:21;23:23;"What do you call somebody from Connecticut?"
23:23;23:24;"Good question."
23:24;23:26;"Like, from New York, you're a New Yorker."
23:26;23:28;"New Jersey, you're a New Jerseyan."
23:28;23:30;"I think you're just a person from Connecticut."
23:30;23:35;"So actually, it's a connecticotion, or a nutmegger."
23:35;23:37;"That rolls off the tongue."
23:37;23:38;"Connecticut's the nutmeg state?"
23:38;23:39;"I guess so."
23:39;23:41;"I thought it was the Constitution state."
23:41;23:42;"Oh, maybe it's both."
23:42;23:49;"♪ We keep on waiting, waiting, waiting on the world to change ♪"
23:49;23:51;"That was a bummer."
23:51;23:54;"Yeah, depress you as a connecticotion."
23:54;23:57;"Next up after Connecticut is another state that I would consider random,"
23:57;24:00;"but I grew up in New Jersey, people consider that random too,"
24:00;24:02;"although I would argue that it has gravitas."
24:02;24:03;"But another random state--"
24:03;24:04;"Big time."
24:04;24:08;"Maybe the most random state is, of course, Delaware."
24:08;24:10;"Yeah, I have no idea who's from Delaware."
24:10;24:11;"I've met great people from Delaware."
24:11;24:13;"I've played great shows in Delaware."
24:13;24:15;"There's no sales tax there."
24:15;24:18;"I believe a lot of credit card companies are headquartered in Delaware,"
24:18;24:21;"and they're very friendly to corporations."
24:21;24:25;"The biggest artist out of Delaware, George Thurgood and the Destroyers."
24:25;24:27;"Oh."
24:27;24:28;"He was born in Wilmington."
24:28;24:30;"Terrible."
24:30;24:31;"You're not a fan?"
24:31;24:32;"You're a rock dude."
24:32;24:34;"I thought you loved rock, man."

25:04;25:05;"Man."
25:05;25:08;"I remember just being in the car, listening to classic rock radio,"
25:08;25:10;"and it'd be like, Eagle, Steve Miller, Credence."
25:10;25:11;"I'd be like, yeah, this is good."
25:11;25:13;"Oh, Credence, that's another California band."
25:13;25:18;"But then Thurgood would come on, and I'd just be like, what is this?"
25:18;25:19;"Maybe you felt that way because--"
25:19;25:21;"Why is this guy famous?"
25:21;25:23;"What do you mean because he rocks?"

25:26;25:28;"Come on."
25:28;25:29;"This is catchy."
25:29;25:31;"Make your argument for Thurgood."

25:41;25:42;"All right."
25:42;25:46;"Apologies to Delaware and all the George Thurgood fans out there."
25:46;25:48;"A resident rock expert."
25:48;25:51;"Everyone in Delaware right now is just going ape."
25:51;25:54;"They're just getting ready for the barbecue tomorrow,"
25:54;25:58;"just chopping up some onions to put into the patties."
25:58;26:03;"Some prick on Apple Radio is just laying into George Thurgood."
26:03;26:05;"Not cool, man."
26:05;26:06;"All right."
26:06;26:07;"How about Florida?"
26:07;26:09;"Who do you think Billboard picked?"
26:09;26:11;"The definitive Florida artist."
26:11;26:13;"I mean, we mentioned Petty already."
26:13;26:15;"He's from Gainesville."
26:15;26:17;"I feel like Skinner is also from northern Florida."
26:17;26:19;"I think I understand this list better."
26:19;26:23;"Billboard was kind of just -- they were making some judgment calls about who they think represents the state."
26:23;26:25;"So I'll give you a hint."
26:25;26:31;"I think they probably felt like other states were represented well by like the kind of white southern rock."
26:31;26:34;"So I think with Florida, they went for somebody with a little Latin flavor."
26:34;26:36;"Fred Durst."
26:36;26:40;"Actually, I would have picked Biscuit for the ultimate Florida artist."
26:40;26:42;"Julio Iglesias?"
26:42;26:43;"No."
26:43;26:44;"Is he from Florida?"
26:44;26:48;"He was born in Havana, Cuba, but then she moved to Florida."
26:48;26:49;"Gloria Estefan?"
26:49;26:50;"Gloria Estefan."
26:50;26:51;"Okay."
26:51;26:53;"And she started her career, of course, in the Miami Sound Machine."
26:53;26:54;"Right."
26:54;26:55;"A definitive band."
26:55;26:57;"So you might remember this is a big hit."
26:57;26:59;"Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga."
26:59;27:01;"I know you can't control yourself any longer."
27:01;27:03;"Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga."
27:03;27:05;"I know you can't control yourself any longer."
27:07;27:08;"This sounds good."
27:08;27:10;"Yeah, it's pretty good."
27:10;27:13;"There was a big Latin music explosion in the mid-'80s in America."
27:13;27:15;"Really?"
27:15;27:16;"Oh, yeah, you think about like--"
27:16;27:23;"Obviously, America has a huge population of people from Latin America, Spanish speakers."
27:23;27:27;"For many people in this country, Latin music is an eternal thing."
27:27;27:31;"Like the biggest radio stations in most cities tend to be Spanish language."
27:31;27:39;"But there are these moments where there are clusters of kind of Latin songs on the charts."
27:39;27:41;"Like in the mid-'80s, there was like this."
27:41;27:42;"Lionel Richie."
27:43;27:44;"All night long."
27:44;27:46;"You know, even Buster Poindexter doing kind of a calypso."
27:46;27:50;"Let's say pan-Latin Caribbean doing a hot, hot, hot."
27:50;27:52;"Yeah, yeah."
27:52;27:54;"This is good."
27:54;27:55;"Yeah."
27:55;27:56;"What year is this?"
27:56;27:58;"'85."
27:58;28:00;"This is maybe the best song so far."
28:00;28:04;"Everybody, gather round now."
28:04;28:08;"Let your body feel the heat."
28:08;28:12;"Don't you worry if you can't dance."
28:12;28:16;"Let the music move your feet."
28:16;28:24;"Get the rhythms of the island and that sugarcane so sweet."
28:24;28:37;"If you want to do the conga, you've got to listen to the beat."
28:37;28:39;"Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga."
28:39;28:41;"Know you're looking for yourself, skinny and stronger."
28:41;28:43;"Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger."
28:43;28:45;"Don't you fight it 'til you try to do the conga beat."
28:45;28:53;"That was Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine with conga getting rave reviews over here at the Time Crisis July 4th Power Center."
28:53;28:55;"Who's from Georgia?"
28:55;28:56;"Florida Georgia Line."
28:56;29:01;"Hey, Jake's really been learning something in his work on Time Crisis."
29:01;29:02;"Allman Brothers."
29:02;29:04;"They didn't pick Allman Brothers."
29:04;29:06;"Okay, I mean, that's what I think of."
29:06;29:07;"I'm going to be here."
29:07;29:09;"Is it rock or what is it?"
29:09;29:13;"It's, I guess what would have been called back then R&B, but--"
29:13;29:15;"I was thinking maybe like outcast or something."
29:15;29:16;"Oh, that'd been a good choice."
29:16;29:18;"I mean, yeah, there's so much good music from Atlanta."
29:18;29:19;"Yeah."
29:19;29:21;"They chose an older artist, Ray Charles."
29:21;29:22;"Oh, okay."
29:22;29:23;"I mean, you can't mess with that."
29:23;29:24;"Yeah."
29:24;29:26;"Georgia on my mind is the state's official song."
29:26;29:29;"Great song."
29:29;29:36;"Georgia the whole day through."
29:36;29:38;"The whole day."
29:38;29:44;"Just an old sweet song."
29:44;29:47;"Keeps Georgia on my mind."
29:47;29:53;"Georgia on my mind."
29:53;30:03;"I said Georgia, Georgia,"
30:03;30:09;"the song of you."
30:09;30:19;"Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines."
30:19;30:22;"That was Ray Charles with Georgia on my mind."
30:22;30:24;"A Georgia native."
30:24;30:26;"Georgia's definitely one of the most powerful music states,"
30:26;30:27;"especially in 2016."
30:27;30:28;"Yeah."
30:28;30:31;"More music comes out of Atlanta than New York lately."
30:31;30:33;"Who are the heavy hitters coming out of Georgia right now?"
30:33;30:35;"I mean, mostly rap."
30:35;30:36;"Uh-huh."
30:36;30:42;"You know, from Outkast, Cee Lo, Migos,"
30:42;30:44;"many of the biggest producers."
30:44;30:45;"Right."
30:45;30:47;"Friend of the show, I Love Maconin."
30:47;30:50;"Who do you think's the biggest artist out of Hawaii?"
30:50;30:51;"I don't know."
30:51;30:52;"I have no idea."
30:52;30:53;"All right, I'll play the beginning, see if you know who it is."
30:53;30:56;"One, two, one, two, three."
31:01;31:02;"Who is it?"
31:02;31:03;"I don't know."
31:03;31:04;"Sounds cool, though."
31:04;31:05;"Yeah."
31:05;31:06;"Really?"
31:08;31:09;"Bruno Mars."
31:09;31:10;"Oh, okay."
31:10;31:11;"I didn't know he was from there."
31:11;31:13;"He was born in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu."
31:13;31:14;"Wait, what is this song from?"
31:14;31:15;"I don't know, like a few years ago."
31:15;31:16;"Huh."
31:16;31:17;"It's kind of like their police song."
31:17;31:18;"That's cool, yeah."
31:18;31:19;"Oh, yeah, good call."
31:19;31:21;"It kind of has that sting, raspiness."
31:21;31:22;"Yeah."
31:37;31:39;"Yeah, it's very police."
31:39;31:41;"Your sex takes me to paradise."
31:48;31:52;"Now it's getting more and more like house."
31:52;31:53;"Yeah, a little."
31:53;31:56;"It started off like sort of more natural."
31:56;31:58;"This is like some anthemic EDM rock."
31:58;32:00;"Yeah, this is where it kind of loses me."
32:18;32:20;"All right, Bruno Mars, biggest artist out of Hawaii."
32:20;32:21;"Okay."
32:21;32:23;"Idaho, that's a tough one."
32:23;32:24;"Built a spill."
32:24;32:26;"Built a spill in the indie community."
32:26;32:29;"He has a cherished Idaho band."
32:29;32:32;"But for the rest of the world, it's all about Paul Revere and the Raiders."
32:32;32:33;"What?"
32:33;32:34;"They're from Idaho?"
32:34;32:36;"They're from--they formed in Boise."
32:36;32:37;"What?"
32:37;32:40;"And they notched 21 Hot 100 hits between '61 and '73."
32:40;32:45;"Can you imagine like early '60s Boise garage band?"
32:45;32:47;"Boise, 1961."
32:47;32:51;"I think they like sent a tape to like a label in LA or something."
32:51;32:52;"Like how did they--"
32:52;32:54;"I don't know, maybe they moved out of Boise."
32:54;32:55;"Yeah, maybe they moved."
32:59;33:00;"I'm sad."
33:27;33:29;"Girl."
33:29;33:35;"That was Paul Revere and the Raiders, a Boise band, with their song ""Kicks."""
33:35;33:37;"They should have chose Built a Spill."
33:37;33:40;"No one knows that Paul Revere and the Raiders is from Idaho,"
33:40;33:44;"but people really associate Built a Spill with Idaho."
33:44;33:45;"I mean, that's a close one."
33:45;33:47;"That's like, come on."
33:47;33:49;"Built a Spill did their thing."
33:49;33:50;"How about Illinois?"
33:50;33:53;"Who do you think is the biggest artist out of Illinois?"
33:53;33:54;"Chicago?"
33:54;33:55;"Yeah."
33:55;33:56;"Okay."
33:56;33:57;"It's Chicago."
33:57;33:58;"All right."
33:58;33:59;"That was an interesting band."
33:59;34:00;"It was a great song."
34:00;34:01;"Pretty original."
34:01;34:04;"I mean, no one really sounded like Chicago."
34:04;34:06;"Nice mix of rock and jazz."
34:06;34:07;"Yeah."
34:07;34:08;"Funk."
34:08;34:11;"Do people in Chicago, like Chicago is like an important band to them?"
34:11;34:12;"I wonder about that."
34:12;34:15;"Like if you're like a real Chicago guy and you hear this song,"
34:15;34:16;"you're just like, oh, yeah."
34:16;34:19;"This is like New York state of mind for New Yorkers."
34:19;34:20;"Yeah."
34:20;34:23;"I mean, I feel like I know a lot of people from Chicago,"
34:23;34:25;"and the band Chicago never comes up."
34:43;34:45;"What park are they talking about?"
34:45;34:46;"Grant Park?"
34:46;34:47;"I don't know."
34:47;34:49;"You know, I've never been to Chicago."
34:49;34:50;"You've never been to the city of Chicago?"
34:50;34:51;"I've never been there."
34:51;34:52;"You're kidding."
34:52;34:53;"Is that weird?"
34:53;34:54;"Wait, never on tour?"
34:54;34:55;"You've never been to the city of Chicago?"
34:55;34:57;"I've never been to Chicago."
34:57;34:58;"Wow."
34:58;34:59;"It's really weird."
34:59;35:01;"I've been to Chicago probably 20 times."
35:01;35:02;"I believe it."
35:02;35:03;"Real Chicago guy."
35:03;35:05;"[Laughter]"
35:05;35:08;"Yeah, at first I didn't know what to make of Chicago"
35:08;35:10;"because I think coming from New York --"
35:10;35:11;"The band or the city?"
35:11;35:12;"The city."
35:12;35:14;"I was just kind of like, you know, like when you go from New York,"
35:14;35:16;"you go to L.A. It's so different."
35:16;35:18;"Chicago is like similar to New York in a lot of ways."
35:18;35:19;"Right."
35:19;35:21;"But then actually Chicago really is a great town,"
35:21;35:24;"especially if you get a tour from a real Chicagoan."
35:24;35:25;"I mean, I'd love to do it."
35:25;35:26;"It's great."
35:26;35:27;"Good people."
35:27;35:29;"Very cold in the winter."
35:29;35:30;"Yeah, I wouldn't want to go there."
35:30;35:31;"It's cool."
35:31;35:32;"You should come to Lollapalooza."
35:32;35:35;"Lollapalooza is one of actually the best American festivals."
35:35;35:39;"It's like right--you know that Grant Park was where Obama spoke when he won?"
35:39;35:40;"Right."
35:40;35:41;"Like right by on Lake Michigan?"
35:41;35:42;"Mm-hmm."
35:42;35:43;"That's where it is."
35:43;35:44;"It's like right in the center of the city."
35:44;35:45;"People come in, people come out."
35:45;35:46;"It's like very well organized."
35:46;35:49;"Shout out to Lollapalooza and to all the people of Illinois."
35:49;35:53;"I wonder, though, if rural Illinois people don't like Chicago,"
35:53;35:55;"if it's like a New York Manhattan thing."
35:55;35:56;"Right."
35:56;35:58;"Maybe they would have gone with Cheap Trick."
35:58;36:00;"Are they from rural Illinois?"
36:00;36:01;"Rockford, bro."
36:01;36:02;"Probably."
36:02;36:06;"Yeah, I bet if you're from southwestern Illinois,"
36:06;36:08;"maybe Chicago doesn't mean that much to you."
36:08;36:11;"You're into Cheap Trick, you're into Smashing Pumpkins,"
36:11;36:13;"Jesus Lizard."

36:27;36:28;"they probably should have chosen Mellencamp."
36:28;36:31;"Mellencamp is the iconic Indiana artist,"
36:31;36:36;"but there's a far superior artist who was born in Gary, Indiana."

43:41;43:42;"Oh, that'd be sick."
43:42;43:44;"Great song by Kansas."
43:44;43:46;"How about Kentucky?"
43:46;43:47;"Loretta Lynn?"
43:47;43:48;"Hey, good call."
43:48;43:49;"That's who they picked."
43:49;43:52;"Loretta Lynn, of course, she's from Butcher Holler."
43:52;43:56;"Although I always thought that hollers were in West Virginia."
43:56;43:57;"Regional."
43:57;43:59;"There's hollers all over that part of the country."
43:59;44:00;"Appalachian."
44:00;44:02;"Where people mine coal, there's hollers."
44:02;44:04;"In the coal mountains, there's hollers."
44:04;44:06;"For anybody who doesn't know, at home,"
44:06;44:08;"I'm going to awkwardly try to explain this"
44:08;44:09;"because I don't exactly know what it is."
44:09;44:10;"I don't either."
44:10;44:13;"My understanding is that a holler is like a little valley"
44:13;44:16;"in a kind of mountainous region,"
44:16;44:18;"and they're called hollers because you holler across."
44:18;44:19;"Oh, really?"
44:19;44:20;"Or something."
44:20;44:22;"So a holler is like a little village"
44:22;44:24;"maybe in the foothills of a mountain"
44:24;44:26;"in kind of coal-mining country."
44:26;44:27;"Wouldn't it be funny if in--"
44:27;44:29;"because in L.A., everything's called a canyon."
44:29;44:31;"Maybe it's just the same thing."
44:31;44:33;"Imagine if L.A. was part of West Virginia"
44:33;44:37;"and it'd be like Beechwood Holler, Laurel Holler,"
44:37;44:38;"Butcher Holler."
44:38;44:41;"So this is, of course, Loretta Lynn's iconic song,"
44:41;44:42;"""Coal Miner's Daughter."""

44:53;44:54;"Yeah, it's a biopic."
44:54;44:56;"It's Sissy Spacek playing Lauretta Lynn."
44:56;44:58;"Tommy Lee Jones plays her husband."
44:58;44:59;"Whoa."
44:59;45:00;"It's an incredible movie."
45:00;45:02;"I think she actually launched her career"
45:02;45:04;"in Washington state, though."
45:04;45:06;"Hmm, Washington, wow."

55:38;55:39;"I don't know."
55:39;55:41;"Probably Boston's close to New York, which is, like,"
55:41;55:42;"a music center."
55:42;55:43;"Lemonheads."
55:43;55:44;"Are from Boston?"
55:44;55:46;"Interesting."
55:46;55:48;"That was Aerosmith of ""Sweet Emotion."""

55:55;55:58;"Michigan, you know, you got Detroit, Rock City, Motown,"
55:58;55:59;"so many--"
55:59;56:01;"There's a lot going on in Michigan."
56:01;56:02;"When you break it down, Michigan--"
56:02;56:03;"Up there."
56:03;56:07;"Pound for pound, per capita, major music state."
56:07;56:10;"Yeah, I mean, first things first, kid rock, right?"
56:10;56:11;"First things first."
56:11;56:14;"I'd say first things first, Eminem, Motown."
56:14;56:15;"Kiss?"
56:15;56:16;"No, Kiss is from New York."
56:16;56:18;"Nugent."
56:18;56:19;"Obviously Bob Seger."
56:19;56:20;"That goofball."
56:20;56:21;"MC5."
56:21;56:23;"The dude from the Eagles, Glenn Frey."
56:23;56:25;"Iggy Pop, yeah, all of it."
56:25;56:27;"When you consider that Michigan's way smaller"
56:27;56:29;"than, like, New York or L.A., Michigan might be"
56:29;56:31;"one of the most powerful music states."
56:31;56:32;"Yeah, for sure."
56:32;56:34;"So there's one that we haven't even talked about"
56:34;56:35;"in the pop world."
56:35;56:36;"Really?"
56:36;56:37;"Like, contemporary?"
56:37;56:39;"She came out in the early '80s."
56:39;56:40;"She's still doing her thing."
56:40;56:41;"Oh, okay, Madonna."
56:41;56:42;"Madonna."
56:42;56:43;"All right."
56:43;56:45;"She was born in Bay City,"
56:45;56:48;"and she graduated from Rochester Adams High School,"
56:48;56:51;"and she even attended old U.M.I.S.H."
56:51;56:53;"before dropping out to move to New York City."
56:53;56:55;"What's your favorite Madonna song?"
56:55;56:56;"My favorite Madonna song?"
56:56;56:59;"It might be this one, ""Like a Prayer."""
56:59;57:00;"Yeah."
57:00;57:01;"What's your favorite Madonna song?"
57:01;57:03;"I would say ""Like a Prayer."""
57:03;57:04;"Yeah, it's great."
57:04;57:05;"Maybe ""Get Into the Groove."""
57:05;57:06;"It's a good one."
57:06;57:09;"Remember, Madonna was so controversial."
57:09;57:10;"Yeah."
57:10;57:11;"Early '90s."
57:11;57:13;"She had that sex book."
57:13;57:14;"Yeah, just for being naked."

57:21;57:22;"Oh, yeah."
57:22;57:23;"Maybe."
57:23;57:24;"I guess there is a lot to be--"
57:24;57:25;"People were fired up."
57:25;57:26;"She was just taking religious imagery"
57:26;57:27;"and just tweaking it hard."

01:18:23;01:18:26;"And you drive an hour or two over to this recording studio."
01:18:26;01:18:28;"Really? Like you don't even stop in El Paso?"
01:18:28;01:18:30;"I think he's way north of there."
01:18:30;01:18:31;"North of El Paso?"
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Yeah."
01:18:32;01:18:33;"Oh, okay."

01:18:42;01:18:45;"This is the only indie band on the list."
01:18:45;01:18:46;"The Shins, I mean, The Shins truly were,"

01:21:00;01:21:02;"This is from that album that's all 50s stuff."
01:21:02;01:21:05;"I love that he looked to Frankie Valli"
01:21:05;01:21:08;"as a source of inspiration in the mid-80s."
01:21:08;01:21:09;"That's so interesting."
01:21:09;01:21:12;"I mean, for him, it was like his childhood, probably."
01:21:12;01:21:12;"Yeah, man."
01:21:12;01:21:15;"I mean, I love Frankie Valli in the four seasons,"
01:21:15;01:21:16;"don't get me wrong."
01:21:16;01:21:18;"But you just wouldn't think of a prominent artist."
01:21:19;01:21:21;"Looking to mine that territory."
01:21:21;01:21:24;"That's that tri-state area swag."
01:21:24;01:21:26;"So this is a song Billy Joel wrote in the 80s"
01:21:26;01:21:29;"when he couldn't get over the fact"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"that he was married to Christie Brinkley."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"Right."
01:21:32;01:21:33;"And he wouldn't shut up about it."
01:21:33;01:21:35;"That backfired, yeah."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"If I was Christie Brinkley, I'd have been like,"
01:21:37;01:21:38;"I don't know what deep insecurity you have,"
01:21:38;01:21:41;"but like, I'm with you, married you,"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"you're a very successful singer-songwriter."
01:21:43;01:21:46;"I'm not like an uptown girl, I'm your wife."
01:21:46;01:21:47;"'Cause you know what?"
01:21:47;01:21:52;"If you treat your lady like she's an uptown girl,"
01:21:52;01:21:53;"and you can't get over it,"
01:21:53;01:21:56;"you're also like, I can't believe she got with a backstreet,"
01:21:56;01:21:57;"a backstreet guy like me."
01:21:57;01:22:00;"You're being condescending to yourself."
01:22:00;01:22:01;"You're being condescending to yourself."
01:22:01;01:22:02;"You're also being condescending to them,"
01:22:02;01:22:04;"because it's like, you're making this assumption"
01:22:04;01:22:07;"that they are somehow breaking a taboo in their own life."
01:22:07;01:22:08;"Yeah, like slumming it."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"Yeah, and maybe she doesn't care."
01:22:09;01:22:11;"And then you're probably really prone to jealousy."
01:22:11;01:22:14;"I wonder if he said really cheesy stuff to her in private."
01:22:14;01:22:15;"I'm sure."
01:22:16;01:22:18;"Oh, God."
01:22:18;01:22:19;"I can imagine--"
01:22:19;01:22:20;"Pillow talk?"
01:22:20;01:22:24;"Can you imagine Joel Brinkley pillow talk in like '85?"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"And just like, going to a party,"
01:22:26;01:22:28;"and like an uptown guy comes over,"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"and is like talking to her a little bit,"
01:22:30;01:22:33;"and like Billy's like over there with like Elton John."
01:22:33;01:22:34;"He's like, ""Excuse me, Elton."
01:22:34;01:22:35;"""What's going on?"""
01:22:35;01:22:36;"And Chrissy Brinkley's just like,"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"""Oh, you remember like Chad?"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"""He grew up uptown with me."""
01:22:40;01:22:42;"And Billy's like, ""I wanna go home now."""
01:22:42;01:22:44;"He's just hammered."
01:22:45;01:22:45;"Oh, God."
01:22:45;01:22:47;"Just like,"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"mean bursting his forehead."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"He's always an angry guy."
01:22:50;01:22:52;"His music always had so much anger."
01:22:52;01:22:54;"But seriously, if there are any guys out there,"
01:22:54;01:22:57;"any backstreet guys who are dating uptown girls,"
01:22:57;01:22:58;"just get over it."
01:22:58;01:23:01;"She's with you, like innocent 'til proven guilty, okay?"
01:23:01;01:23:04;"If she says or does something that makes you feel insecure"

01:34:18;01:34:19;"I think it was more just about getting out of town."

01:36:49;01:36:51;"I think that song was a hit"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"in the era that I was delivering pizza."
01:36:53;01:36:54;"- Oh yeah, I've heard of it."
01:36:54;01:36:56;"- And I was just like listening to a ton of radio."
01:36:56;01:36:58;"- Oh yeah, 2001."
01:36:58;01:36:59;"- Like, yeah, exactly."

01:37:07;01:37:08;"- Yeah."
01:37:08;01:37:09;"- Were you delivering pizza on 9/11?"
01:37:09;01:37:10;"- Oh yeah."
01:37:10;01:37:11;"- Really?"
01:37:11;01:37:11;"- Yeah."
01:37:11;01:37:12;"I worked the closing shift."
01:37:12;01:37:13;"- 9/11, 2001."
01:37:13;01:37:14;"- Yes."
01:37:14;01:37:16;"So the terrorist attack happens."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"- Yeah."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"- And then I called into the store"
01:37:18;01:37:19;"at like two or three that afternoon."
01:37:19;01:37:21;"I was like, ""Are we open?"""
01:37:21;01:37:22;"- Yeah."
01:37:22;01:37:23;"(laughing)"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"- And my manager, Dave Hemmer, was like,"
01:37:25;01:37:26;"""Yeah, bro, we're open."""
01:37:26;01:37:27;"- Get your butt in, Jake."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"- He's like, ""And we're slammed."""
01:37:29;01:37:30;"- Really?"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"- Oh yeah, and so that night we were slammed."
01:37:32;01:37:34;"And actually, this is a little crazy."
01:37:34;01:37:38;"I made the most I'd ever made delivering pizza that night."
01:37:38;01:37:41;"'Cause we were slammed, but also people had this like,"
01:37:41;01:37:44;"what ended up being a very fleeting call of duty"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"to overtip the pizza guy."
01:37:46;01:37:47;"- Whoa."
01:37:47;01:37:48;"That's crazy."
01:37:48;01:37:49;"- Yeah."
01:37:49;01:37:50;"- Everybody was a little freaked out,"
01:37:50;01:37:51;"didn't wanna go outside, so they ordered in pizza."
01:37:51;01:37:53;"- Everyone was at home watching."
01:37:53;01:37:54;"- Watching the news."
01:37:54;01:37:55;"- Yeah."
01:37:55;01:37:55;"- And then you come and they overtip you"
01:37:55;01:37:58;"as an act of goodwill towards their fellow American."
01:37:58;01:37:59;"- Yeah."
01:37:59;01:38:00;"- I guess there's nothing wrong with that."
01:38:00;01:38:01;"- No."
01:38:01;01:38:02;"- Yeah."
01:38:02;01:38:03;"- It was crazy to be working."
01:38:03;01:38:05;"- It's not like you directly profited off a tragedy."
01:38:05;01:38:08;"That's like a tangential bonus."
01:38:08;01:38:10;"- No, it was cool that it happened."
01:38:10;01:38:15;"And then like, September 13th, it's back to like,"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"you know, $1.75."
01:38:17;01:38:20;"- Ain't that America."

01:38:28;01:38:29;"No, no, they're from Virginia."
01:38:29;01:38:31;"- Dave Matthews is from South Africa."
01:38:31;01:38:32;"- Oh, whoa."

01:52:51;01:52:55;"Now we keep saying that we're okay"
01:52:55;01:52:58;"But I don't want to settle for good, not great"
01:52:58;01:53:01;"I miss the way that it felt back then"
01:53:01;01:53:05;"I want to feel that way again"
01:53:05;01:53:08;"It's been so long that you forget"
01:53:08;01:53:11;"The way I used to kiss your neck"
01:53:11;01:53:17;"Remind me, remind me"
01:53:17;01:53:18;"Oh, that's sweet."
01:53:18;01:53:20;"It's a song about a couple"
01:53:20;01:53:22;"that's trying to rekindle that early passion."
01:53:22;01:53:23;"Right."
01:53:23;01:53:25;"And she's saying, ""Remind me,"""
01:53:25;01:53:27;"what it used to be like in the early days."
01:53:27;01:53:29;"Yeah, broken in the early days."
01:53:29;01:53:31;"Great song."
01:53:31;01:53:32;"Wisconsin."
01:53:32;01:53:33;"Great song."
01:53:33;01:53:35;"Who's from Wisconsin?"
01:53:35;01:53:37;"Hootie?"
01:53:37;01:53:38;"No."
01:53:38;01:53:42;"There's some bands from Wisconsin."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"Yeah, I mean, I always liked Wisconsin."
01:53:44;01:53:45;"I always liked Madison, Wisconsin."
01:53:45;01:53:48;"I feel like there's some heavyweights"
01:53:48;01:53:49;"I'm forgetting here from Wisconsin."
01:53:49;01:53:51;"They picked Les Paul,"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"the inventor of the electric guitar."
01:53:53;01:53:54;"Okay."
01:53:54;01:53:56;"So he's like a jazz guitarist."
01:53:56;01:53:59;"You know who's from Wisconsin is Butch Big."
01:53:59;01:54:00;"Really?"
01:54:00;01:54:01;"Yeah."
01:54:01;01:54:02;"I'm sure there's some type of..."
01:54:02;01:54:04;"Someone in Wisconsin right now is just like..."
01:54:04;01:54:05;"You idiots."
01:54:05;01:54:06;"Yeah."
01:54:06;01:54:07;"How are you forgetting?"
01:54:07;01:54:08;"Blah, blah, blah."
01:54:08;01:54:10;"This is cool, this music."
01:54:10;01:54:12;"I don't know Les Paul's work, really."
01:54:12;01:54:13;"Invented the hard body electric guitar."
01:54:13;01:54:14;"Is this like 40s?"
01:54:14;01:54:15;"What is it?"
01:54:15;01:54:16;"I don't know when this recording is from,"
01:54:16;01:54:18;"but he was playing jazz guitar his whole life."
01:54:18;01:54:19;"We're at the last state."
01:54:19;01:54:21;"You know what the last state is?"
01:54:21;01:54:22;"Alabama's the first state."
01:54:22;01:54:23;"Wyoming?"
01:54:23;01:54:24;"Yeah, Wyoming."
01:54:24;01:54:26;"We made it from Alabama to Wyoming."
01:54:26;01:54:28;"Dick Cheney?"
01:54:28;01:54:31;"I guess Dick Cheney is from Wyoming."
01:54:31;01:54:32;"Yeah."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"Although, is he really from Wyoming?"
01:54:34;01:54:36;"Is he like born in Wyoming?"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"You know, it was like funny because George Bush is from Texas,"
01:54:38;01:54:41;"but his family's like old school New England establishment."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"Yeah."
01:54:42;01:54:43;"And I always felt like with Dick Cheney,"
01:54:43;01:54:44;"is he really like..."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"Yeah, probably not."
01:54:45;01:54:47;"Dick Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska."
01:54:47;01:54:48;"Oh."
01:54:48;01:54:50;"But then his family moved to Wyoming,"
01:54:50;01:54:51;"so he grew up in Wyoming."
01:54:51;01:54:53;"I think Wyoming is the least populous state."
01:54:53;01:54:55;"Yeah, Wyoming is in terms of people,"
01:54:55;01:54:56;"is a very small state."
01:54:56;01:55:00;"The bar band scene in like Cheyenne or Laramie."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"Right."
01:55:01;01:55:02;"Slim pickings."
01:55:02;01:55:07;"Numerically, the odds are against Wyoming for producing musicians of note."
01:55:07;01:55:08;"And someone in the country scene,"
01:55:08;01:55:12;"or someone that moved to California when they were like four."
01:55:12;01:55:15;"Well, Billboard picked Chris Ledue,"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"and his song is called ""This Cowboy's Hat."""
01:55:17;01:55:20;"So we could probably, using context clues,"
01:55:20;01:55:22;"assume that it's in the country music genre."
01:55:22;01:55:23;"Let's check it out."
01:55:23;01:55:28;"But also, you know, it's important to like check your biases."
01:55:28;01:55:30;"And just 'cause the guy's name is Chris Ledue,"
01:55:30;01:55:33;"and his song's called ""This Cowboy's Hat,"""
01:55:33;01:55:35;"it doesn't mean it's country."
01:55:35;01:55:37;"So let's listen with open ears."
01:55:37;01:55:38;"Okay."
01:55:38;01:55:39;"And see."

01:57:29;01:57:31;"Yeah, totally. The narrative."
01:57:31;01:57:33;"Really, yeah, like a reversal of a Bob Seger song."
01:57:33;01:57:36;"You know that Bob Seger song, ""Turn the Page""?"
01:57:36;01:57:37;"Yeah."

01:57:50;01:57:51;"Right."
01:57:51;01:57:53;"They're the ones out there murdering people."
01:57:53;01:57:58;"But we don't forget that there's times where maybe in a certain type of situation,"
01:57:58;01:58:02;"a cowboy might be painted into a corner, too, surrounded by bikers."
01:58:02;01:58:05;"Especially in the contemporary context."
01:58:05;01:58:08;"Right, he might have to stand up for himself and say,"

01:58:10;01:58:12;"You know when you're, like, in an airport or something,"
01:58:12;01:58:15;"and you see, like, the guy with, like, the cowboy hat and the boots?"
01:58:15;01:58:16;"Yeah."
01:58:16;01:58:17;"He's putting himself out there a little bit."
01:58:17;01:58:18;"Right."
01:58:18;01:58:20;"Well, then in some places, like Texas, it's not--"
01:58:20;01:58:22;"you're not putting yourself out there that much, bud."
01:58:22;01:58:24;"No, yeah, but if that guy gets off the plane--"
01:58:24;01:58:25;"Well, yeah, I'm sure, like--"
01:58:25;01:58:26;"--in, like, San Francisco--"

01:58:28;01:58:29;"Right."

01:59:14;01:59:15;"It's July 3rd, man."

01:59:19;01:59:23;"We're going to be grilling up burgers, hot dogs."
01:59:23;01:59:26;"I just want to pose one last question to you before we leave."
01:59:26;01:59:27;"Is a hot dog a sandwich?"
01:59:27;01:59:28;"No."
01:59:28;01:59:30;"No, why not?"
01:59:30;01:59:31;"It's meat on bread."
01:59:31;01:59:32;"What is it if it's not--"
01:59:32;01:59:35;"But you eat it vertically?"
01:59:35;01:59:36;"Laterally?"
01:59:36;01:59:38;"I don't know what the term would be."
01:59:38;01:59:41;"Sometimes you eat a sub like that."
01:59:41;01:59:42;"That's true."
01:59:42;01:59:43;"Okay, you make a good point."
01:59:43;01:59:45;"So what is it?"
01:59:45;01:59:46;"I mean, it's its own category."
01:59:46;01:59:48;"Okay, is a burger a sandwich?"
01:59:48;01:59:49;"Absolutely."
01:59:49;01:59:50;"A burger is a sandwich."
01:59:50;01:59:51;"Yeah."
01:59:51;01:59:52;"A hot dog is its own deal."
01:59:52;01:59:55;"All right, well, if anybody at home has a different opinion,"
01:59:55;01:59:57;"please tweet at us."
01:59:57;02:00:01;"We'd love to find out before the barbecue starts tomorrow."

02:00:27;02:00:31;"You're free to be American however you damn well please,"
02:00:31;02:00:33;"because that's what it means to be American."
