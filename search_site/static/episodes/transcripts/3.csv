05:59;06:03;"I can make your bed rock, girl"
06:03;06:06;"I can make your bed rock"
06:09;06:11;"That was Young Money with ""Bedrock."""
06:11;06:13;"I don't know why I wanted to listen to that song today."
06:13;06:15;"I was thinking about it a little bit this week."
06:15;06:17;"It was a great song."
06:17;06:21;"You know, there's like a parallel that can be drawn there."
06:21;06:24;"There's ""Eat the Booty,"" like ""Groceries Now,"""
06:24;06:26;"and ""Grocery Bag."""
06:26;06:29;"I mean, ""Grocery Bag"" is the most famous line from that song,"
06:29;06:31;"in my world, at least."
06:31;06:32;"No, I think in everybody's world."
06:32;06:34;"'Cause it was confusing."
06:34;06:35;"And it was also kind of the--"
06:35;06:38;"it was maybe at the inception of the--"
06:38;06:39;"Hashtag."
06:39;06:40;"Hashtag rap, yeah."
06:40;06:41;"No, that was a huge line."
06:41;06:43;"And I got a grocery bag."
06:43;06:44;"Grocery bag."
06:44;06:46;"I was like, ""Hey, grocery bagged."""
06:46;06:48;"This was an argument I had with some people,"
06:48;06:49;"'cause it was like, ""Oh, I--"""
06:49;06:51;"That might be a little better if it said ""grocery bagged."""
06:51;06:53;"Right, 'cause it's like, ""I bagged her. I got her."
06:53;06:55;"""Grocery bagged."""
06:55;06:56;"There's something weird about saying ""eat groceries."""
06:56;06:57;"I don't know why."
06:57;06:58;"Yeah."
06:58;07:02;"Groceries generally have to be prepared before they're eaten."
07:02;07:05;"And also, groceries could include like Ajax, Tide--"
07:05;07:06;"Toilet paper, yeah."
07:06;07:07;"Toilet paper."
07:07;07:09;"[laughing]"
07:09;07:10;"You like that?"
07:10;07:12;"Welcome to ""Time Crisis."""
07:12;07:16;"Today we're coming live from literally Hollywood, California."
07:16;07:18;"Some people don't realize that Hollywood is actually"
07:18;07:20;"a neighborhood in Los Angeles."
07:20;07:22;"Me and Despot both happen to be out here."
07:22;07:23;"Yeah."
07:23;07:24;"Sorry, Cousin Asher."
07:24;07:26;"Cousin Asher's out on the East Coast."
07:26;07:29;"Filling in for Asher, we got Jake Longstreth."
07:29;07:30;"'Sup?"
07:30;07:34;"Now, Jake, you're a longtime resident of L.A."
07:34;07:36;"Yeah, long-ish."
07:36;07:39;"You're somebody who's from Connecticut originally,"
07:39;07:42;"so I think you really identify with the West Coast."
07:42;07:43;"Absolutely."
07:43;07:46;"Can you give us a little history about where you've lived?"
07:46;07:47;"Sure."
07:47;07:50;"I mean, my entire adult life, except for 2 years,"
07:50;07:52;"I've been on the West Coast--"
07:52;07:56;"Portland, Oregon; San Francisco, Oakland, and L.A."
07:56;08:01;"So pretty much the bulk of the Bohemian West Coast enclaves."
08:01;08:02;"And you're a painter."
08:02;08:03;"Yeah."
08:03;08:05;"I first met Jake because his younger brother's"
08:05;08:07;"Dave Longstreth of Dirty Projectors,"
08:07;08:09;"and Jake and I actually went on tour together,"
08:09;08:10;"playing with the DPs."
08:10;08:12;"Dude, that was 10 years ago exactly."
08:12;08:13;"That's crazy."
08:13;08:14;"Summer '05."
08:15;08:16;"Double minivan assault."
08:16;08:20;"Rolling through America, playing art spaces,"
08:20;08:21;"homes, sleeping on floors."
08:21;08:23;"Yeah, Shreveport, Louisiana."
08:23;08:25;"Yeah, that was a big one, Shreveport, Louisiana."
08:25;08:26;"Well, thanks for joining us, Jake."
08:26;08:27;"Yeah, man."
08:27;08:29;"Jake knows a lot about rock music."
08:29;08:30;"I know a lot of our listeners at home"
08:30;08:32;"might not even know what that is,"
08:32;08:34;"but Jake's going to hip us to some of what's good"
08:34;08:36;"about rock music, and specifically a band"
08:36;08:38;"very much associated with the West Coast,"
08:38;08:39;"The Grateful Dead."
08:39;08:41;"We're going to get into that a little bit later."
08:41;08:43;"It's funny, because I was thinking about--"
08:43;08:45;"because you sent that text yesterday that was like,"
08:45;08:49;"pick a few songs and then make a case to the youth"
08:49;08:51;"why they're not trash."
08:51;08:53;"And I was like, well, first of all,"
08:53;08:56;"you have to like music with guitars."
08:56;08:58;"Well, anybody can be-- well, hold on."
08:58;08:59;"I think we've got to go into some music."
08:59;09:00;"I want to get into all this."
09:00;09:02;"In the meantime, since we're out in L.A.,"
09:02;09:04;"I figured we might as well listen to some"
09:04;09:06;"California music, so I've been thinking about this guy"
09:06;09:10;"a bit recently, because there's a movie that involves him"
09:10;09:11;"coming out very soon."

16:08;16:10;"We just looked up the Sugar Freeze from Pomona."
16:10;16:11;"That's where we were last week."
16:11;16:13;"- Yeah, we were in Pomona."
16:13;16:14;"- So what'd you think about that?"
16:14;16:16;"Well, first of all, for everybody who's listening,"
16:16;16:18;"Despai and I were both at Hard Fest."
16:18;16:21;"We performed our song with Makonnen for the first time."
16:21;16:24;"So what was your take on Hard Fest?"
16:24;16:28;"- Uh, I've never been to Hard Fest."
16:28;16:32;"I don't think I've ever been to an EDM festival."
16:32;16:33;"- What was Hard Fest?"
16:33;16:34;"- An EDM festival."
16:34;16:36;"- Okay."
16:36;16:38;"Jake, are you familiar with the phrase EDM?"
16:38;16:39;"- Yeah."
16:39;16:39;"- 'Cause Jake, as we said before,"
16:39;16:41;"is our resident rock guy."
16:41;16:41;"- Yeah."
16:41;16:43;"- Electronic dance music."
16:43;16:45;"- That's right."
16:45;16:46;"Electronic dance music."
16:46;16:47;"Hard is probably like the biggest"
16:47;16:50;"kind of brand name festival for EDM."
16:50;16:52;"This one, it's all over the place,"
16:52;16:54;"but this one specifically was out in Pomona"
16:54;16:55;"at the Fairplex."
16:55;16:56;"- Yeah."
16:56;16:58;"- And the headliner the night that we were there"
16:58;17:00;"was Jack U, which is Skrillex and Diplo."
17:00;17:01;"They brought Bieber out."
17:01;17:04;"So it's a pretty big festival, multiple stages."
17:04;17:05;"- They brought out the Biebs."
17:05;17:07;"- They brought out the Biebs."
17:07;17:08;"Did you watch that?"
17:08;17:10;"- No, I was watching Rat-A-Tat."
17:10;17:12;"- Rat-A-Tat was it? - Oh, they played?"
17:12;17:13;"- Yeah. - That's cool."
17:13;17:15;"- Yeah, Rat-A-Tat's about as rocky as you would get"
17:15;17:17;"at Hard Fest."
17:17;17:19;"And Makonnen was there."
17:19;17:20;"And so we came out, did the song."
17:20;17:22;"We did it, it was really hot."
17:22;17:23;"- It was okay."
17:23;17:24;"I think that song would be better performed"
17:24;17:26;"maybe next time at like a Makonnen show."
17:26;17:29;"- Yeah, I don't think anybody knew who we were"
17:29;17:31;"or what that song was or anything."
17:31;17:33;"- I think you had a lot of people on Molly."
17:33;17:34;"They wanted to hear--"
17:34;17:35;"- The song about Molly."
17:35;17:37;"- The song about Molly."
17:37;17:38;"(laughing)"
17:38;17:39;"But it was still fun."
17:39;17:40;"I don't know about that."
17:40;17:41;"- I felt weird though."
17:41;17:42;"I felt out of place kind of."
17:42;17:43;"I felt old. - You felt old?"
17:43;17:46;"- I got drunk though, and then I felt not old."
17:46;17:50;"And it was fun, I guess."
17:51;17:53;"I was offered a (beep) job at one point"
17:53;17:55;"and I turned it down."
17:55;17:56;"- Hey."
17:56;17:58;"- Yeah, which made me feel old, I guess."
17:58;17:59;"- Strong."
17:59;18:00;"- That made me feel old."
18:00;18:02;"- Everybody wants to have a good time at a festival."
18:02;18:02;"- Right."
18:02;18:05;"(laughing)"
18:05;18:07;"- Are people drinking at this?"
18:07;18:08;"- Yes."
18:08;18:09;"- It's all underage drinking?"
18:09;18:11;"- Yeah, but first and foremost,"
18:11;18:13;"the EDM festival's about MDMA."
18:13;18:16;"We don't endorse that necessarily."
18:16;18:18;"I mean, people gotta do what they're gonna do."
18:18;18:21;"- I'm not a big fan of that drug, that particular drug."
18:21;18:24;"It makes me feel sticky."
18:24;18:24;"- Sticky?"
18:24;18:25;"- Mm-hmm."
18:25;18:26;"- Like literally sticky?"
18:26;18:28;"Like your skin feels sticky?"
18:28;18:29;"- Like if you've been out all day"
18:29;18:31;"and it's hot out and you were sweating"
18:31;18:34;"and then you get home and the sweat dries on you"
18:34;18:37;"and you feel a little gross and you need a shower."
18:37;18:39;"That's what Molly makes me feel like."
18:39;18:41;"- One thing I find interesting about Molly"
18:41;18:42;"is it feels like in some ways,"
18:42;18:46;"that and lean feel like the last drugs."
18:46;18:48;"It seems like so much of youth culture"
18:48;18:50;"is about a new drug coming out"
18:50;18:51;"that everybody starts doing"
18:51;18:53;"and it kind of syncs up with the music."
18:53;18:55;"And of course you had that in the '60s"
18:55;18:56;"with like weed and psychedelics."
18:56;18:57;"Suddenly everybody has that."
18:57;18:59;"It goes very well with say,"
18:59;19:00;"Your Grateful Dead. - Ludes."
19:00;19:01;"You had Ludes."
19:01;19:04;"- You had, and then you had Ludes in the '70s"
19:04;19:06;"to help people listen to James Taylor or whatever."
19:06;19:09;"And then in the late '80s,"
19:09;19:12;"you have the birth of like true massive rave culture"
19:12;19:17;"in England with MDA, MDMA, Molly, whatever."
19:17;19:18;"- Ecstasy is what we were calling it."
19:18;19:20;"- Ecstasy is what they were calling it back then."
19:20;19:22;"And it kind of also syncs up with like Acid House"
19:22;19:24;"and trance music all comes together."
19:24;19:25;"And then maybe in the early '90s,"
19:25;19:26;"you have the birth of like lean"
19:26;19:30;"and the, you know, whatever, DJ Screw type stuff."
19:30;19:32;"But like, it almost feels like we're waiting"
19:32;19:34;"for a new drug to sync up with youth culture."
19:34;19:35;"Or maybe I just don't know because I'm getting older."
19:35;19:36;"- Nah, we know some."
19:36;19:37;"- What are some of the new ones?"
19:37;19:40;"- There's K2, which is the synthetic weed."
19:40;19:43;"But like it makes people turn into crazy zombies"
19:43;19:45;"and do all types of (beep) up shit."
19:45;19:46;"- That sounds horrible."
19:46;19:49;"- Yeah, and bath salts, that's new."
19:49;19:51;"- That's so dark that there's a new weed"
19:51;19:53;"that turns into a zombie."
19:53;19:54;"- Yeah, 'cause it's just--"
19:54;19:55;"- Weed is like, that's supposed to be"
19:55;19:59;"the most chill, kind drug."
19:59;20:00;"- Yeah, I mean--"
20:00;20:01;"- And it's so dark that we're at a point"
20:01;20:03;"where it's just sort of like, no, synthetic,"
20:03;20:04;"and it's harsh."
20:04;20:05;"- Isn't it kind of a good metaphor though,"
20:05;20:07;"that the dream of the '60s is dead?"
20:07;20:09;"- Yeah, pharmaceuticals now."
20:09;20:11;"- But these sound like very dangerous drugs."
20:11;20:14;"- They are, but that, I mean, that's what keeps happening"
20:14;20:16;"is that these giant companies take advantage"
20:16;20:19;"of the fact that illegal drugs are illegal."
20:19;20:21;"So it's like, let's make this horrible (beep)"
20:21;20:25;"that's completely chemical and will ruin everything."
24:43;24:59;"- What's this?"
24:59;25:01;"- You don't know this? - No."
25:01;25:03;"- Loggins and Messina, Danny's song?"

29:25;29:27;"I've been traveling this summer too, a little bit."
29:27;29:29;"- Where you been? - Playing some music."
29:29;29:32;"Just a, you know, up to the Bay Area, up to Portland."
29:32;29:33;"Nothing crazy."
29:33;29:34;"- Any camping?"
29:34;29:36;"- Yep, went to the Channel Islands."
29:36;29:37;"- Where's that?"
29:37;29:39;"- Channel Islands National Park."
29:39;29:40;"- Is that near here?"
29:40;29:41;"- Yeah, yeah. - It's off the coast of California?"
29:41;29:44;"- You drive out to Ventura, and then you get on a ferry,"
29:44;29:47;"and you take, it's like an hour out to these islands."
29:47;29:49;"On the way out, you see whales."
29:49;29:53;"And when we did it, we saw 14 humpback whales."
29:53;29:54;"- 14? - That's a lot."
29:54;29:56;"- And one blue whale, which apparently,"
29:56;30:00;"I didn't know this, is the largest animal to ever live."

30:07;30:08;"- Yeah, like-- - 'Cause they fill with gas"
30:08;30:10;"and they explode? - Yeah, that's sad."
30:10;30:11;"- It's disgusting."
30:12;30:17;"- Woe to them that are at ease in Zion."
30:17;30:19;"- Is that, what, is that me?"
30:19;30:21;"- That's the whales. - Was that like a shot at me?"

32:59;33:01;"- So, Jake, I'd like to talk a little bit"
33:01;33:03;"about your history as a music fan."
33:03;33:04;"You've been kind of a rock dude."
33:04;33:06;"- I guess. I don't know."
33:06;33:08;"I mean, yeah, that's kind of what--"
33:08;33:10;"I mean, I didn't-- I never thought about it."
33:10;33:12;"- Now, I think ""The Grateful Dead,"""
33:12;33:13;"and the reason that I wanted you"
33:13;33:15;"to specifically talk about them today"
33:15;33:17;"is because, A, I think a lot of kids out there"
33:17;33:20;"think they're trash without even knowing anything about them"
33:20;33:21;"and probably haven't even heard them."
33:21;33:23;"And I think also ""The Grateful Dead"""
33:23;33:27;"is a band that became so much bigger as a concept..."
33:27;33:28;"- Right."
33:28;33:30;"- That people instinctively recoil from it"
33:30;33:33;"because ""The Grateful Dead"" represents a type of person..."
33:33;33:35;"- Right. - Or maybe some-- an ideology."
33:35;33:38;"- Absolutely. I mean, I remember I came into ""The Dead"""
33:38;33:41;"pretty casually. My folks were into ""The Dead."""
33:41;33:44;"Not, like, heavy Deadheads. They just had a few records."
33:44;33:47;"And I grew up listening to them and really liked them."
33:47;33:49;"It was never, like, a huge Deadhead."
33:49;33:51;"- Yeah. - And then I remember, like,"
33:51;33:53;"hanging out in these, like,"
33:53;33:55;"snotty, uptight indie rock circles,"
33:55;33:58;"and people were just like, ""You like 'The Dead'?"""
33:58;34:00;"And I was like, ""Yeah, I mean, I like 'Pavement,'"
34:00;34:02;"I like 'The Dead,' it's all kind of, like,"
34:02;34:04;"this West Coast, lackadaisical rock."""
34:04;34:06;"- Right. - It's just good songwriting,"
34:06;34:09;"good guitar playing, and it was such a divisive band."
34:09;34:11;"It's a funny thing about ""The Dead"" too,"
34:11;34:13;"is, like, their musical legacy sucks."
34:13;34:16;"Like, fish sucks, widespread panic sucks,"
34:16;34:19;"leftover salmon sucks, like, all those jam bands, like..."
34:19;34:21;"- [laughs]"
34:21;34:23;"- And, like, and so I can see--"
34:23;34:25;"and, like, that scene seems kind of lame."
34:25;34:27;"Their virtuosity and their musicality"
34:27;34:29;"is much more organic in their own."
34:29;34:32;"It's not like Berklee School of Music guitar shredder dudes."
34:32;34:34;"- Right. - Which I feel like"
34:34;34:36;"a lot of the jam band dudes are."
34:36;34:39;"- Mm-hmm. - And ""The Dead"" were just, like,"
34:39;34:41;"this weird amalgam."
34:41;34:43;"Like, no one has ever played a guitar like Jerry Garcia"
34:43;34:45;"or bass like Phil Lesh."
34:45;34:47;"I know that sounds like a dork, but it's true."
34:47;34:49;"I mean, like, there's a real lyricism there."
34:49;34:52;"- Okay, Jake, so, you know, now that Apple's provided us"
34:52;34:54;"with this incredible platform, Beats 1,"
34:54;34:57;"we ask you to pick a few Grateful Dead songs"
34:57;34:59;"to try to educate the youth, because we know"
34:59;35:01;"the majority of kids out there think the Grateful Dead"
35:01;35:03;"are trash, reminds them of good-for-nothing people."
35:03;35:05;"- I don't know where you got that from."
35:05;35:07;"- ""Trash"" is a harsh word, dude."
35:07;35:10;"- That's what kids say now. It's not as bad as it sounds."
35:10;35:13;"- [laughs] But, like, I've never heard a young kid say,"
35:13;35:15;"""Yo, Grateful Dead are trash, man."""
35:15;35:17;"- That's because they say they're trash,"
35:17;35:19;"and then they don't speak of it again,"
35:19;35:21;"because they hate them so much."
35:21;35:23;"- [laughs]"
35:23;35:25;"- But they wear the T-shirts."
35:25;35:27;"- That's true. They do wear the T-shirts,"
35:27;35:30;"so perhaps there is some hope that you could convince the youth"
35:30;35:32;"that the Grateful Dead are not trash."
35:32;35:34;"So, Jake, we want to give you the opportunity"
35:34;35:36;"to go three rounds, pick three songs,"
35:36;35:38;"to really make a case for why the Grateful Dead"
35:38;35:40;"are not trash and maybe even good."
35:40;35:42;"So where do you want to start? - Pressure's on, dude."
35:42;35:46;"Um, I want to start with Scarlet Begonias from 1974."
35:46;35:50;"Um, when it starts, you may think it sounds like"
35:50;35:53;"the subsequent jam bands that are stealing from the dead."
35:53;35:55;"Keep in mind it's from '74."
35:55;35:58;"It's a solid 20 years before Phish really hit their peak."
35:58;36:02;"- Okay. - And Phish and all those other jam bands"
36:02;36:04;"never wrote a song this good."
36:04;36:07;"- Okay, strong words from Jake. Apologies to Phish."

38:12;38:14;"Alec, what do you think of the Grateful Dead?"

38:19;38:21;"I guess they are hippies."
38:21;38:25;"Right now they're at a house just outside of Woodstock."

38:31;38:33;"""I'm gonna like the Grateful Dead,"""

38:35;38:38;"And I tried, and I'm not sure if I did."

38:42;38:44;"I think the Grateful Dead get better and better."
38:44;38:46;"- I would agree with that sentiment."
38:46;38:48;"- Well, Jake, I don't know if Scarlet Begonias"
38:48;38:50;"really got the kids on your side."
38:50;38:52;"The phone lines are lighting up."
38:52;38:53;"A lot of kids saying, ""That's trash."
38:53;38:55;"We want to hear more new music."""
38:55;38:57;"But we want to hear at least a few songs."
38:57;38:59;"- The Dead--okay, here's the thing, man."
38:59;39:02;"I mean, in one sense, their iconography"

39:06;39:07;"- Mm-hmm."
39:07;39:09;"- But the actual content of their career"
39:09;39:11;"is somehow maybe antithetical to this, like,"
39:11;39:13;"Internet era where we're sort of like--"
39:13;39:14;"you're like, ""We don't have time"
39:14;39:17;"to listen to this four-minute song."""
39:17;39:18;"- It's true. We're too hyper today."
39:18;39:20;"- It's just like the rewards of their music"
39:20;39:22;"are maybe slower to reveal themselves."
39:22;39:23;"- Right."
39:23;39:25;"- But I think they're richer for it."
39:25;39:26;"- Yeah, it's like books."
39:26;39:28;"It's like nobody reads books anymore,"
39:28;39:31;"but a lot of people say that spending time"
39:31;39:33;"with even, like, something crazy"
39:33;39:34;"like a 500-page book"
39:34;39:37;"would actually be more rewarding..."
39:37;39:38;"- Absolutely."
39:38;39:41;"- Than reading maybe 500 different tweets."
39:41;39:43;"- Okay, Jake, what you got for us next"

43:46;43:48;"that ""Grateful Dead"" going on tour in '72,"
43:48;43:52;"that's not that different than Hardfest in Pomona 2015."
43:52;43:55;"- Right, the ""Grateful Dead"" fans,"
43:55;43:58;"it's like a very serious drug culture."
43:58;44:01;"The parking lots at those shows are"
44:01;44:03;"where you get the best drugs in the world,"
44:03;44:06;"like any type of, well, mostly psychedelics."
44:06;44:09;"Deadheads are like, at least in my experience,"
44:09;44:10;"very passionate people,"
44:10;44:14;"and they have these sort of intense feelings"

44:34;44:36;"- Yeah, you got bands, you got drug bands."

44:50;44:52;"- And just as an outside observer,"

44:58;44:59;"- Sex, also."

54:51;54:53;"- It's been a while. - Yeah."
54:53;54:55;"- Last time I saw you was in New York"
54:55;54:57;"for the rap party for your movie."
54:57;54:59;"- Yes, ""Coco."" - Can we talk about the movie"
54:59;55:01;"a little bit? - Sure."
55:01;55:05;"- So what is it? - Um, the movie is--"
55:05;55:08;"it's a film about a young girl named Coco,"
55:08;55:11;"and she's a student in college,"
55:11;55:14;"but she's also trying to figure out this rap career"
55:14;55:17;"with these guys that she goes to high school with."
55:17;55:21;"It's, you know, she comes from a bit of a middle-class family."
55:21;55:23;"The father's died, and the mom really wants her"
55:23;55:26;"to go back to school, but she's set on figuring out"
55:26;55:29;"this rap career and becoming this famous rapper"
55:29;55:31;"with these guys in this group."
55:31;55:33;"And the mom finally forces--"
55:33;55:35;"I don't want to give too much of it away,"
55:35;55:37;"but the mom finally forces her to go back to school,"
55:37;55:39;"and once she's enrolled in the school,"
55:39;55:41;"she gets into this poetry class thinking that, you know,"
55:41;55:43;"like, she's like, ""Oh, this is just something"
55:43;55:45;"I'm just gonna, you know, breeze through."""
55:45;55:47;"But she gets into the poetry class,"
55:47;55:49;"and she meets this teacher"
55:49;55:54;"who just kind of turns her, um, view of hip-hop"
55:54;55:58;"and just view of rapping and art all inside out."
55:58;56:00;"So the whole movie is basically--"
56:00;56:02;"- And who is the teacher? Who plays the teacher?"
56:02;56:04;"- I don't want to give too much of it away."
56:04;56:06;"- Oh, really? But isn't-- the cast is not public?"
56:06;56:08;"- The teacher's Jill Scott. - Okay."
56:08;56:10;"- So there's a lot of that in the movie of me and her,"
56:10;56:12;"like, you know, going back and forth,"
56:12;56:14;"and she's just teaching me a thing or two."
56:14;56:17;"And, um, yeah, so the whole premise of the movie"
56:17;56:19;"is just rap versus spoken word,"
56:19;56:22;"which is really interesting, because I was just kind of--"
56:22;56:25;"I don't know, not to be like, ""Oh, like, ooh, poetry."""
56:25;56:27;"You know, like, I don't like poetry,"
56:27;56:29;"but I guess I was just really unaware"
56:29;56:32;"of this huge spoken word scene."
56:32;56:34;"And, you know, that's really big"
56:34;56:37;"and really actually thriving, and I was really, you know,"
56:37;56:39;"surprised to actually enjoy a lot of it."
56:39;56:42;"So now--now I'm into spoken word."
56:42;56:45;"- And it's directed by RZA? - Directed by RZA."
56:45;56:47;"- Is he cool? - RZA's mad cool."
56:47;56:48;"- You know him before? - No."
56:48;56:50;"- You like Wu-Tang? - Yeah."
56:50;56:52;"- So, Azalea, so far today,"
56:52;56:54;"we've been spending a lot of time with Jake."
56:54;56:56;"I'd like to introduce you to Jake Longstreth."
56:56;56:57;"He's a painter."
56:57;57:00;"He's been teaching us a bit about ""Grateful Dead."""
57:00;57:02;"- Oh, cool. - Are you a ""Grateful Dead"" fan at all?"
57:02;57:04;"- Not really, no."
57:04;57:05;"- But you're kind of a rock fan."
57:05;57:06;"- Yeah."
57:06;57:08;"- What rock bands do you like?"
57:08;57:11;"- I like The Doors, and I like..."
57:11;57:12;"- Interesting."
57:12;57:14;"- We were talking some trash about The Doors earlier."
57:14;57:16;"- I like this band called Stories."
57:16;57:17;"- Who's that?"
57:17;57:19;"- They're kind of like a prog rock band."
57:19;57:21;"I like all kinds of rock, but I really like prog rock."
57:21;57:24;"I like kind of, like, Broadway-style rock."
57:24;57:25;"- Is it like ""Yes"" or...?"
57:25;57:27;"- It's like a Queen vibe."
57:27;57:29;"- Okay. - Hello, Queen. That's tight."
57:29;57:31;"- It's dope. Maybe--maybe you can listen to some of it later."
57:31;57:33;"- Let's listen to some of it from Stories."

01:08:03;01:08:05;"kind of gave me a look. Yeah,"
01:08:05;01:08:06;"I feel like I was being made"
01:08:06;01:08:07;"fun of on my own radio show"
01:08:07;01:08:08;"just for singing along."
01:08:08;01:08:09;">>> Okay, I'm sorry."
01:08:09;01:08:10;">>> Oh, thank you."
01:08:10;01:08:11;">>> I'm glad you guys made up."
01:08:11;01:08:12;">>> I'm glad we made up."
01:08:12;01:08:14;"Lenny Kravitz."
01:08:14;01:08:15;">>> I didn't even know about"
01:08:15;01:08:16;"that."
01:08:16;01:08:17;">>> You don't know about that?"
01:08:17;01:08:18;">>> No."
01:08:18;01:08:19;">>> Wait, do you know about it?"
01:08:19;01:08:20;"Basically Lenny Kravitz was"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"performing live and he was"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"wearing leather pants with"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"no underwear and he kind of"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"dipped down in a rock move"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"and they split."
01:08:30;01:08:32;">>> Oh, and a dick came out?"
01:08:32;01:08:35;">>> Yeah, and his dick was"
01:08:35;01:08:36;"fully visible."
01:08:36;01:08:37;">>> Where's the picture?"
01:08:37;01:08:38;">>> There it is. That's the"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"video. I think when something"
01:08:40;01:08:41;"like that happens, first of"
01:08:41;01:08:42;"all, we've got to say to"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"Lenny Kravitz, you're a"
01:08:43;01:08:44;"beautiful, handsome person"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"and we feel bad that"
01:08:46;01:08:47;"something that you didn't"
01:08:47;01:08:48;"expect to happen, happened,"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"but at the same time, you"
01:08:50;01:08:51;"keep on rocking and we'll"

01:12:42;01:12:45;"That was Lenny Kravitz with ""It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over."""
01:12:45;01:12:48;"A beautiful song from the late '80s."
01:12:48;01:12:51;"Azealia, are you a Lenny Kravitz fan?"
01:12:51;01:12:55;"I couldn't say that I'm exactly a Lenny Kravitz fan, you know?"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"I don't dislike Lenny Kravitz."
01:12:57;01:13:00;"I guess I don't know enough of his music to say that I'm a fan."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"But yeah, I don't have anything against Lenny Kravitz."
01:13:03;01:13:07;"Normally on this show, we do a little segment called..."
01:13:07;01:13:10;"This is ""View York News."""
01:13:11;01:13:13;"Where we talk about the news in New York."
01:13:13;01:13:16;"It's a little bit weird because we're all out here in Hollywood."
01:13:16;01:13:19;"Oh, so news in New York, did you hear about the Legionnaires' disease?"
01:13:19;01:13:20;"No."
01:13:20;01:13:22;"All the people in the Bronx that got Legionnaires?"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"Yeah, I heard like five or six people have Legionnaires' disease,"
01:13:24;01:13:25;"which I never heard of before."
01:13:25;01:13:28;"I read like 70 people got it and like five or six people died."
01:13:28;01:13:29;"Oh, really?"
01:13:29;01:13:30;"Yeah."
01:13:30;01:13:32;"So what's the story? Tell us about it."
01:13:32;01:13:35;"Legionnaires' disease is, I guess, it's a sort of..."
01:13:35;01:13:38;"I think the name Legionnaires' disease comes from..."
01:13:38;01:13:41;"Because when they first discovered this bacteria,"
01:13:41;01:13:46;"it's like a certain sort of bacteria that lives in cooling units,"
01:13:46;01:13:50;"like central air or air conditioners and stuff like that."
01:13:50;01:13:55;"And there was some Legion conference, some shit happened."
01:13:55;01:13:57;"And that's where they found it."
01:13:57;01:13:59;"So it got the name Legionnaires' disease."
01:13:59;01:14:03;"But it's like some sort of water-based bacteria."
01:14:03;01:14:07;"Right, so they said it's not contagious, but you get it from the water source."
01:14:07;01:14:10;"You can get it from the source, but it's not like, you know, people--"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"you can't pass it from person to person."
01:14:12;01:14:13;"That sucks."
01:14:13;01:14:16;"Well, we want to extend our sympathies at Time Crisis"
01:14:16;01:14:20;"to everybody out there suffering from any sort of bacterial infection"

01:20:35;01:20:39;"Despot, Azealia Banks and visual artist Jake Longstreth."
01:20:39;01:20:44;"We just heard the song ""Day-O"" as sung by Harry Belafonte. Beautiful song."
01:20:44;01:20:50;"Probably one of my favorite songs of all time. Although I didn't really know what it was about until my adult life."
01:20:50;01:20:52;"Have you guys ever really thought about the lyrics?"
01:20:52;01:20:53;"No, what's it about?"
01:20:53;01:20:57;"It's unclear to me if it's like working on like a banana plantation or what"
01:20:57;01:21:01;"But it's like about really working hard and like having to work and like it sucks"
01:21:01;01:21:04;"And you're asking the guy who tallies how many bananas you counted?"
01:21:04;01:21:05;"Oh"
01:21:05;01:21:06;"You're saying like please come tally"
01:21:06;01:21:08;"Come tally my bananas"
01:21:08;01:21:09;"Come tally my bananas, I wanna go"
01:21:09;01:21:12;"I guess I never really thought about it. It's like about like working like a brutal job"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"And just like being desperate to go home"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"Wait, so he's picking bananas all night?"
01:21:16;01:21:19;"Cause this daylight comes and he wants to go home"
01:21:19;01:21:20;"Yes, I guess so"
01:21:20;01:21:21;"You pick bananas at night?"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"Why would you pick bananas at night?"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"I mean I guess it's not as hot"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"We'll have to do some research on this and talk about it"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"Probably do it 24/7, harsh industry"
01:21:29;01:21:33;"They used to do all sorts of crazy stuff. They would go in there, topple governments"
01:21:33;01:21:38;"I once read an article that said there used to be thousands of varieties of bananas"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"Then there were bananas that tasted like strawberries"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"There were little bananas, there were big bananas"
01:21:42;01:21:49;"And that all this crazy modern agriculture and like psycho corporate stuff"
01:21:49;01:21:52;"They basically, we only get to taste one type of banana"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"They homogenize the banana"
01:21:54;01:21:57;"So since we got on Life 2015, we've been eating one type of banana our whole lives"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"They're basically blood bananas from what I understand"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"It's like corn or something"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"Yeah, it's horrible"
01:22:03;01:22:06;"So anyway, we just wanna say to all the big fruit companies"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"Making people's lives miserable"
01:22:08;01:22:09;"Cool out"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"I think it's time to get into a little bit of"
01:22:12;01:22:19;"It's time for the Top 5 on iTunes"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"Obviously I'm not very familiar with the drops"
01:22:21;01:22:24;"Because I said ""It's time"" and then the guy said ""It's time"""
01:22:24;01:22:28;"So I'm really not that smooth as a radio host yet"
01:22:28;01:22:31;"But anyway, Despo and I have done this for the past two"
01:22:31;01:22:34;"We kinda go through the Top 5 songs on iTunes"
01:22:34;01:22:36;"And just talk about them"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"So Azalea and Jake, would you like to join us"
01:22:38;01:22:41;"Through this journey through the pop cultural landscape?"
01:22:41;01:22:42;"Yeah"
01:22:42;01:22:45;"So we're gonna start with song number 5"
01:22:45;01:22:47;"Honestly, it's getting a little bit boring for me"
01:22:47;01:22:50;"But I know you guys might be excited to talk about it"
01:22:50;01:22:53;"The song number 5 on the iTunes chart right now"
01:22:53;01:22:56;"Is ""Cheerleader"" by Omi"
01:22:56;01:23:00;"And this is the Felix Yan remix"
01:23:00;01:23:02;"Is anybody familiar with this song?"
01:23:02;01:23:03;"No"
01:23:03;01:23:04;"Jake's never heard it?"
01:23:04;01:23:05;"Mm-mm"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"I like it"
01:23:06;01:23:09;"Sounds cool so far"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"This is one of the biggest songs of the summer"
01:23:11;01:23:15;"Where would I hear it? Like on the radio?"
01:23:15;01:23:17;"Yeah"
01:23:17;01:23:21;"You would hear it literally anywhere"
01:23:21;01:23:24;"Now ringing in Belgium?"
01:23:24;01:23:37;"Ready for the chorus?"
01:23:37;01:23:38;"Yeah"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"Not really"
01:23:40;01:23:45;"Everybody's dancing in the studio"
01:23:45;01:23:48;"When I need her"
01:23:48;01:23:52;"I think that I found myself a cheerleader"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"Kinda gives me like a Lionel Richie"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"All night long kind of vibe"
01:23:56;01:23:57;"I was cool with it"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"I mean, it didn't blow my mind"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"But I mean, it didn't bum me out"
01:24:01;01:24:03;"Sometimes I hear like the top songs"
01:24:03;01:24:04;"Right"
01:24:04;01:24:05;"And it's just like the most like"
01:24:05;01:24:08;"Depressing corporate drivel"
01:24:08;01:24:10;"But that was like, had a good vibe to it"
01:24:10;01:24:12;"Well, let's see how you feel about the rest of the Top 5"
01:24:12;01:24:14;"Get ready to be burned out"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"So number four"
01:24:16;01:24:18;"Last time we did it"
01:24:18;01:24:21;"I said that this was my favorite big hit of the summer"
01:24:21;01:24:22;"I don't even know how I feel anymore"
01:24:22;01:24:24;"It's like between the last time we played this song"
01:24:24;01:24:28;"And now I've heard this song like 2,000 times"
01:24:28;01:24:29;"And I'm honestly starting to lose sight"
01:24:29;01:24:30;"This is number four"
01:24:30;01:24:33;"It's The Weeknd with Can't Feel My Face"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"You know this song, Jake?"
01:24:35;01:24:36;"I don't know"
01:24:36;01:24:37;"Do you know who The Weeknd is?"
01:24:37;01:24:38;"Heard of it"
01:24:38;01:24:40;"Them, him, him?"
01:24:40;01:24:41;"I don't know"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"You know this song, Azealia?"
01:24:43;01:24:44;"I don't know this song"
01:24:44;01:24:45;"Where do you hear this stuff?"
01:24:45;01:24:46;"Really?"
01:24:46;01:24:47;"Yeah, I don't know this song"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"What do you mean everywhere?"
01:24:48;01:24:51;"Same place I saw the lady crab in the street"
01:24:51;01:24:53;"Somebody got their windows open on their car"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"You're gonna hear this song"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"I live in LA, man"
01:24:56;01:24:58;"I mean, I go into Trader Joe's"
01:24:58;01:24:59;"I don't hear this in the Trader Joe's"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"They might play this at Trader Joe's"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"Nah, man, Rod Stewart"
01:25:03;01:25:05;"This is kind of Rod Stewart"
01:25:05;01:25:06;"This is Rod Stewart"
01:25:06;01:25:09;"This is like the Do You Think I'm Sexy of 2015"
01:25:09;01:25:10;"Yeah"
01:25:10;01:25:11;"Alright, get ready for the chorus"
01:25:11;01:25:12;"We'll hear it in Trader Joe's in 30 years"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"Yes"
01:25:13;01:25:19;"I can't feel my face when I'm with you"
01:25:19;01:25:20;"This song sucks"
01:25:20;01:25:25;"Chorus is tight, come on"
01:25:25;01:25:28;"I can't feel my face when I'm with you"
01:25:28;01:25:30;"But I love you"
01:25:30;01:25:32;"You think this song is about cocaine?"
01:25:32;01:25:34;"What drug makes you most not feel your face?"
01:25:34;01:25:35;"Cocaine"
01:25:35;01:25:38;"Weed"
01:25:38;01:25:39;"If you go hard"
01:25:40;01:25:43;"That was number four, The Weeknd with I Can't Feel My Face"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"So, Azealia, you never heard that song before?"
01:25:44;01:25:46;"I never heard that song before"
01:25:46;01:25:47;"But you know who The Weeknd is"
01:25:47;01:25:48;"Of course"
01:25:48;01:25:49;"And you know that it's one person"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"Azealia, do you want to explain your take on who The Weeknd is"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"to somebody who has no idea, like Jake?"
01:25:53;01:25:56;"The Weeknd is an artist"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"Is he from Canada?"
01:25:58;01:25:59;"Yeah, Toronto"
01:25:59;01:26:00;"He's from Canada"
01:26:00;01:26:05;"He makes kind of like, you know, bedroom, dreamy, R&B kind of stuff"
01:26:05;01:26:06;"Kind of style"
01:26:06;01:26:08;"A little bit in the vein"
01:26:08;01:26:09;"Do you know who Drake is?"
01:26:09;01:26:10;"Yeah"
01:26:10;01:26:13;"He's like in the vein of a Drake or like"
01:26:13;01:26:17;"And this summer he's recently crossing over into pop stardom"
01:26:17;01:26:18;"Wait, Alec, I can't remember"
01:26:18;01:26:20;"Do you like this song?"
01:26:20;01:26:21;"No"
01:26:21;01:26:22;"I don't like this song either"
01:26:22;01:26:23;"Really?"
01:26:23;01:26:24;"Well, speaking of art"
01:26:24;01:26:27;"This is Time Crisis' favorite"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"This is number three on the charts"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"I'll admit, when I first heard this song"
01:26:31;01:26:32;"It wasn't exactly my cup of tea"
01:26:32;01:26:34;"But now that it's the third episode of Time Crisis"
01:26:34;01:26:35;"and we're hearing it for another time"
01:26:35;01:26:38;"I do have to say this is definitely one of my favorite songs of the summer"
01:26:38;01:26:41;"This is Rachel Platten with a big summer hit"
01:26:41;01:26:42;"Fight Song"
01:26:42;01:26:47;"Jake, you know this song?"
01:26:47;01:26:52;"No"
01:26:52;01:26:53;"They might play this in Trader Joe's"
01:26:53;01:26:54;"Azealia, do you know this song?"
01:26:54;01:26:56;"No"
01:26:56;01:26:57;"Trader Joe's is a little more like"
01:26:57;01:26:58;"I don't know this song"
01:26:58;01:26:59;"Crusty, classic rock"
01:26:59;01:27:01;"Trader Joe's, I don't like their food"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"Yeah, I agree"
01:27:03;01:27:04;"Like they're prepared"
01:27:04;01:27:05;"It's disgusting"
01:27:05;01:27:06;"You know, those little Indian dinners"
01:27:06;01:27:07;"I don't"
01:27:07;01:27:08;"It's fucking disgusting"
01:27:08;01:27:09;"It's good for like getting staples"
01:27:09;01:27:10;"Tortillas"
01:27:10;01:27:11;"Bananas"
01:27:11;01:27:12;"Yeah, but"
01:27:12;01:27:13;"They got no bananas"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"Decent, cheap wine"
01:27:15;01:27:16;"Yeah, exactly"
01:27:16;01:27:17;"Hold on guys, here's the chorus"
01:27:17;01:27:27;"You really do like this song, though"
01:27:27;01:27:28;"This is my favorite"
01:27:28;01:27:29;"I hate this"
01:27:29;01:27:30;"It's the worst shit in the world"
01:27:30;01:27:32;"It's so bad"
01:27:32;01:27:33;"What is she fighting for?"
01:27:33;01:27:34;"I don't believe"
01:27:34;01:27:35;"I don't know"
01:27:35;01:27:36;"She's fighting her dad, probably"
01:27:36;01:27:38;"Is this Christian?"
01:27:38;01:27:39;"Unclear"
01:27:39;01:27:40;"Alright"
01:27:40;01:27:43;"That was the number three song"
01:27:43;01:27:44;"In the iTunes chart"
01:27:44;01:27:46;"Rachel Platten, Fight Song"
01:27:46;01:27:47;"I would say"
01:27:47;01:27:48;"I'll be going on record and say"
01:27:48;01:27:49;"That's my song of the summer"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"And actually in a dance class"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"That I take out here in L.A."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"That was a song that we were working on"
01:27:55;01:27:56;"Last Tuesday"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"So kind of doing moves to it"
01:27:58;01:27:59;"Is this all"
01:27:59;01:28:00;"Wait, what?"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"Is this all a joke"
01:28:01;01:28:02;"Or is some of it true?"
01:28:02;01:28:03;"None of it's a joke"
01:28:03;01:28:04;"Jake, what"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"Jake, do you have any questions"
01:28:06;01:28:07;"About this song"
01:28:07;01:28:08;"And this artist?"
01:28:08;01:28:09;"Well, I just don't"
01:28:09;01:28:10;"I don't buy it for a second"
01:28:10;01:28:11;"Well, what don't you buy?"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"It just is the most"
01:28:13;01:28:14;"Middle of the road"
01:28:14;01:28:16;"Sort of American Idol"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"I just don't"
01:28:17;01:28:18;"I don't think she knows who she is"
01:28:18;01:28:19;"Exactly"
01:28:19;01:28:20;"What is she fighting for?"
01:28:20;01:28:21;"Oh, you guys don't know anything about this"
01:28:21;01:28:22;"It just sounds like the most"
01:28:22;01:28:24;"I'm not really a fan of like"
01:28:24;01:28:25;"Who is she?"
01:28:25;01:28:26;"The whiny white girl"
01:28:26;01:28:28;"You know, like the whining white girl"
01:28:28;01:28:29;"She's actually black"
01:28:29;01:28:30;"I think"
01:28:30;01:28:31;"She's black"
01:28:31;01:28:32;"I'm just kidding"
01:28:32;01:28:33;"No, no"
01:28:33;01:28:34;"Just like whining white girls"
01:28:34;01:28:35;"I feel like in the 90s"
01:28:35;01:28:36;"Like 2000s"
01:28:36;01:28:37;"Like we had some good"
01:28:37;01:28:38;"Like, okay"
01:28:38;01:28:39;"And I wouldn't even say that"
01:28:39;01:28:40;"Like Michelle Branch was whining"
01:28:40;01:28:41;"Like that's like"
01:28:41;01:28:42;"Like Michelle Branch"
01:28:42;01:28:43;"Alanis Morissette"
01:28:43;01:28:44;"That's like"
01:28:44;01:28:45;"Like, okay, as a black girl"
01:28:45;01:28:46;"Like when I listen to like"
01:28:46;01:28:47;"White girl music"
01:28:47;01:28:48;"Like white girl pop"
01:28:48;01:28:49;"White girl rock"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"I'm listening to like Michelle Branch"
01:28:50;01:28:51;"And like Alanis Morissette"
01:28:51;01:28:52;"Do you like Joni Mitchell?"
01:28:52;01:28:53;"Yeah, but"
01:28:53;01:28:54;"When I hear stuff like that"
01:28:54;01:28:55;"Like, you know, when it's just"
01:28:55;01:28:56;"Kind of like run of the mill"
01:28:56;01:28:57;"Just like, okay"
01:28:57;01:28:58;"Let's just get like a"
01:28:58;01:28:59;"I just don't understand"
01:28:59;01:29:00;"Why is she fighting for"
01:29:00;01:29:01;"I just don't understand"
01:29:01;01:29:02;"Why you guys are calling her whiny"
01:29:02;01:29:03;"She's saying"
01:29:03;01:29:04;"This is my fight song"
01:29:04;01:29:05;"Alan"
01:29:05;01:29:06;"This is a song about"
01:29:06;01:29:07;"Overcoming something"
01:29:07;01:29:08;"This is my fight song"
01:29:08;01:29:09;"I also like that"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"It's called fight song"
01:29:10;01:29:11;"And the name of the EP"
01:29:11;01:29:12;"Is fight song"
01:29:12;01:29:13;"I like"

01:29:16;01:29:17;"Comes in"
01:29:17;01:29:18;"Just the drums drop"
01:29:18;01:29:19;"And there's almost something"
01:29:19;01:29:20;"That reminds you of like"
01:29:20;01:29:21;"Like the war cry"
01:29:21;01:29:22;"Of like the brave heart"
01:29:22;01:29:23;"Like Scottish guys"
01:29:23;01:29:24;"Like getting ready to go to war"
01:29:24;01:29:25;"I love the idea of fighting"
01:29:25;01:29:26;"For something that you believe in"
01:29:26;01:29:27;"And then you're like"
01:29:27;01:29:28;"I'm just gonna fight"
01:29:28;01:29:29;"For something that I believe in"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"And then you're like"
01:29:30;01:29:31;"I'm just gonna fight"
01:29:31;01:29:32;"For something that I believe in"
01:29:32;01:29:33;"And frankly I think in 2015"
01:29:33;01:29:34;"Not a lot of people"
01:29:34;01:29:35;"Believe in anything"
01:29:35;01:29:36;"This is your show"
01:29:36;01:29:37;"And you're"
01:29:37;01:29:38;"Miss America"

01:29:40;01:29:41;"Who's pretending?"
01:29:41;01:29:42;"Look at Miss New Jersey"
01:29:42;01:29:43;"That's right"
01:29:43;01:29:44;"I'm Miss New Jersey"

01:29:45;01:29:46;"We need to have"
01:29:46;01:29:47;"Wasn't it Rachel Platten?"
01:29:47;01:29:48;"We need to have Rachel Platten"
01:29:48;01:29:49;"We need her on the show"
01:29:49;01:29:50;"Platten on the show"
01:29:50;01:29:51;"Now finally"
01:29:51;01:29:52;"Those are songs"
01:29:52;01:29:53;"We've been talking about"

01:30:13;01:30:14;"This is the Meek Mill"
01:30:14;01:30:15;"This is the sh*t"
01:30:15;01:30:16;"So who thinks"
01:30:16;01:30:17;"That for everybody at home"
01:30:17;01:30:18;"Who doesn't know what's going on"
01:30:18;01:30:19;"Who can explain this"
01:30:19;01:30:20;"Most succinctly?"
01:30:20;01:30:21;"I'm not gonna do it"
01:30:21;01:30:22;"Because I"
01:30:22;01:30:23;"You know I work in the rap world"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"And"
01:30:24;01:30:25;"Alright so"
01:30:25;01:30:26;"So Meek was having"
01:30:26;01:30:27;"A pretty good time"
