00:00;00:05;"Today is a very special Time Crisis. In this week's episode, Jake and I go deep on the"
00:05;00:14;"IHOP controversy. Or is it a success story? We also talk about new burger chain ideas,"
00:14;00:20;"as well as introduce a new Doritos Presents Sweet Chili Heat World Premiere. All this,"
00:20;00:29;"plus we're taking you to Ojai. This is Time Crisis with Ezra King. Beep beep beep beep"
00:29;00:30;"beep."
00:30;00:31;"Time Crisis."
00:31;00:32;"One."
00:32;00:33;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:33;00:34;"They were a threat, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:34;00:35;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:35;00:36;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the bus had to go."
00:36;00:37;"And I was left alone, with my head down."
00:37;00:38;"I was left alone, with my head down."
00:48;01:15;"I was left alone, with my head down."
01:15;01:17;"Time Crisis back again."
01:17;01:18;"I was left alone, with my head down."
01:35;01:59;"I was left alone, with my head down."
01:59;02:06;"I was left alone, with my head down."
02:06;02:11;"I was left alone, with my head down."
02:51;02:58;"I was left alone, with my head down."
05:11;05:15;"Brown bag, couple brews, walk two miles in."
05:15;05:20;"Gone are the days when the ox fall down"
05:20;05:25;"You take up the yoke and plow the fields around"
05:25;05:30;"Gone are the days when the lady said please"
05:30;05:39;"""Debtor Jack Charles, won't you come to me?"""
05:39;05:44;"Down I am, living in red granite deep"
05:44;05:50;"The bottom was dusty but the liquor was clean"
05:50;05:54;"Sound of the thunder, let the rain fall down"
05:54;06:04;"It looks like the old man's getting old"
06:04;06:09;"19 or 20 when he stepped to the bar"
06:09;06:14;"Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar"
06:14;06:19;"19, 30 when the wall came in"
06:19;06:28;"He paid his rent, sat on a red-eyed gin"
06:28;06:33;"Down I am, living in red granite deep"
06:33;06:38;"The bottom was dusty but the liquor was clean"
06:38;06:43;"Sound of the thunder, let the rain fall down"
06:43;06:53;"It looks like the old man's getting old"
06:53;06:55;"So this has been a big week."
06:55;06:57;"You know, when Time Crisis started,"
06:57;07:00;"and we were talking a lot about corporate food history,"
07:00;07:05;"things of that nature, it was seen as kind of like a niche topic."
07:05;07:08;"Whereas I think increasingly people are recognizing it as"
07:08;07:10;"a major component of modern life."
07:10;07:15;"And branding and advertising, and I mean specifically for corporate food."
07:15;07:19;"And this past week was maybe one of the biggest"
07:19;07:24;"stupid advertising things related to food in a long time."
07:24;07:25;"You know what I'm talking about?"
07:25;07:26;"I think I missed it."
07:26;07:27;"Oh, IHOP."
07:27;07:29;"Oh, that. Yeah. No, I..."
07:29;07:31;"Actually, Seinfeld, get on the mic."
07:31;07:33;"Hey, what's up?"
07:33;07:37;"I don't know why I associate the IHOP chain becoming IHOP with you."
07:37;07:39;"I feel like this is an idea you might come up with."
07:39;07:40;"I did tweet about it."
07:40;07:42;"Did you do a Time Crisis tweet or a Seinfeld tweet?"
07:42;07:44;"I did a Seinfeld tweet."
07:44;07:45;"What was it?"
07:45;07:48;"The tweet was, ""Seinfeld is now called Seinfelb."""
07:48;07:49;"Oh, nice."
07:49;07:50;"Yeah, thanks."
07:50;07:53;"So for people who don't know, IHOP is a restaurant."
07:53;07:55;"Big chain restaurant."
07:55;07:56;"Huge."
07:56;07:57;"Actually, I went to an IHOP recently."
07:57;07:58;"Where?"
07:58;08:01;"It's kind of like a long story, but I was rolling back into town."
08:01;08:04;"I got time."
08:04;08:06;"I was up in Ojai."
08:06;08:07;"Okay."
08:07;08:08;"Scouting things for the show."
08:08;08:09;"Sure."
08:09;08:11;"Making sure that the electricity was good."
08:11;08:12;"Doing a tech scout."
08:13;08:17;"And then I was getting a ride back from Ojai, but I had to go to Malibu."
08:17;08:22;"Just one of those Ojai-Malibu days, and the person giving me a ride had to go back into L.A."
08:22;08:25;"So I was like, ""All right, you don't have to drive me all the way over the mountains to Malibu."
08:25;08:28;"Maybe you drop me off in Agora Hills."""
08:28;08:30;"Great compromise."
08:30;08:33;"So they dropped me off, and they were like, ""Where do you want me to drop you off?"""
08:33;08:34;"And I was like, ""You know what?"
08:34;08:35;"I want an iced coffee."""
08:35;08:37;"And I see right here there's an IHOP."
08:37;08:38;"Drop me off at the IHOP."
08:38;08:42;"I'll go in, use the restroom with a clear conscience, because I know I'll buy something."
08:42;08:43;"Yep."
08:43;08:44;"And I'll get an iced coffee to go."
08:44;08:46;"Because, you know, I haven't been to IHOP in a while."
08:46;08:48;"I used to go a lot as a kid."
08:48;08:51;"I used to beg my dad to take me there for dinner."
08:51;08:52;"Really?"
08:52;08:53;"Yeah."
08:53;08:54;"There was one in your town?"
08:54;08:56;"There was one a town over."
08:56;08:57;"Beg my dad."
08:57;08:58;"So anyway, back to the story."
08:58;09:05;"I'm rolling down from the Tech Scout in Ojai, and I get dropped off at the Agora Hills IHOP,"
09:05;09:07;"where then I will subsequently get into an Uber."
09:07;09:08;"Right."
09:08;09:16;"So I go in there, and I order an iced coffee, and then they give me a kind of milky, sugary, slurpy kind of thing."
09:16;09:18;"This is not a cold brew."
09:18;09:20;"It's not a cold brew, but it's not -- but look, I'm not a snob."
09:20;09:21;"I actually don't like cold brew."
09:21;09:22;"Too strong."
09:22;09:23;"It's too sour."
09:23;09:24;"I feel you."
09:24;09:27;"People rolling in paying $7 for some sour bullsh*t."
09:27;09:29;"I'm a regular guy."
09:29;09:30;"I don't need no f*cking cold brew."
09:30;09:31;"Language, pal."
09:31;09:32;"Yeah."
09:32;09:34;"And then they brought it out, and I was like, ""Oh, I'm sorry."
09:34;09:36;"I want to just like a black iced coffee."""
09:36;09:39;"And they were like, ""Oh, this is what we call iced coffee."
09:39;09:40;"It's from the machine."""
09:40;09:41;"And I was like, ""Okay."
09:41;09:43;"Well, could I just get a black iced coffee?"""
09:43;09:45;"And they're just like, ""No, we don't do that."""
09:45;09:46;"It's premixed."
09:46;09:48;"And I was like, ""This is unbelievable."""
09:48;09:51;"At this point, iced coffee is not some fancy thing."
09:51;09:52;"No."
09:52;09:54;"There is a fancy version, as you said, called cold brew."
09:54;09:56;"I was like, ""That's just some wild sh*t."
09:56;09:58;"You can't get iced coffee at IHOP."""
09:58;09:59;"Maybe it was just this location."
09:59;10:00;"I don't know."
10:00;10:05;"And then were you like, ""Do you guys brew regular hot coffee?"""
10:05;10:06;"I didn't take it there."
10:06;10:07;"I had to get in the river."
10:07;10:10;"And then if you have some room temp that's been sitting on the crisper there for a second,"
10:10;10:11;"throw some ice cubes in it."
10:11;10:12;"I guess they could do that."
10:12;10:17;"I've had that experience in other countries where iced coffee means kind of like a more"
10:17;10:20;"like an ice cream meets coffee thing."
10:20;10:24;"I just think in America, we've kind of straightened out our shared definition of iced coffee."
10:24;10:26;"I was very surprised by that."
10:26;10:28;"Anyway, that was the last time I went to IHOP."
10:28;10:30;"But I've always had a soft spot for IHOP."
10:30;10:32;"I think I've only been once."
10:32;10:33;"Oh, really?"
10:33;10:34;"You've only been in your whole life?"
10:34;10:35;"In El Paso, Texas."
10:35;10:36;"Oh, with me?"
10:36;10:37;"Was I there?"
10:37;10:38;"Yeah."
10:38;10:39;"Oh, yeah."
10:39;10:41;"I remember that was cool because we were..."
10:41;10:43;"That was the first time I'd really seen a lot of the country."
10:43;10:45;"That was on tour with your brother in Dirty Projectors."
10:45;10:48;"That's when Jake and I first got to know each other."
10:48;10:49;"Yeah."
10:49;10:50;"Time Crisis Origins."
10:50;10:51;"Origin story."
10:51;10:53;"Time Crisis Origins."
10:53;10:56;"That's the movie."
10:56;11:00;"When they're making the Time Crisis movie, they have that scene in El Paso to IHOP."
11:00;11:04;"Who will stop wasting the lives of the brave?"
11:04;11:06;"Based on one lie."
11:06;11:10;"Who will stop wasting the forest and seas?"
11:10;11:13;"We know what will survive."
11:13;11:16;"Who will stop wasting the time?"
11:16;11:19;"Who will stop putting quarters upon our eyes?"
11:19;11:23;"Who will not place himself higher than we?"
11:23;11:26;"For a senator's prize."
11:26;11:32;"We wonder out, why are they kind of drunk and kind of high?"
11:32;11:35;"We know what for and why."
11:35;11:39;"That's us, that's us, that's us."
11:39;11:46;"'Cause the monster eats its young 'til they're gone, gone, gone."
11:46;11:52;"And the rules of it are hard, and that's the way it's done."
11:52;11:59;"Yeah, the monster eats its young 'til they're gone, gone, gone."
11:59;12:02;"'Til it's satisfied and done."
12:02;12:07;"It won't blow, blow, blow."
12:07;12:13;"Who could look up from the numbers and say, something ain't right?"
12:13;12:20;"Who could disrupt the abundance and pray, not for weight but for light?"
12:20;12:23;"How could we risk the empire?"
12:23;12:26;"As the apprentice descends into seasons of idle,"
12:26;12:30;"With an old white Lincoln encrypted in high,"
12:30;12:36;"Sputters down from the sky, red-eyed in July, weeping glyco."
12:36;12:43;"We shout out loud, megaphone, kind of sold but listening in."
12:43;12:46;"We browse our own episodes."
12:46;12:50;"That's us, that's us, that's us."
12:50;12:56;"'Cause the monster eats its young 'til they're gone, gone, gone."
12:56;13:03;"And the rules of it are hard, and that's the way it's done."
13:03;13:09;"And the monster eats its young 'til they're gone, gone, gone."
13:09;13:12;"'Til it's satisfied and done."
13:12;13:15;"It won't blow, blow, blow."
13:15;13:18;"That's us, that's us, that's us."
13:21;13:23;"That was the only time you've been to one?"
13:23;13:26;"I think so. And there's one like a block from my studio."
13:26;13:29;"There's one on Figueroa right next to the Home Depot."
13:29;13:31;"I drive by it every day. Never dipped in."
13:31;13:36;"If I had to guess how many times I've been IHOP in my life, I'm gonna put it at 34."
13:36;13:37;"That's a pretty strong showing."
13:37;13:40;"The last time I went and had a meal at IHOP was about a year ago."
13:40;13:42;"I went to the one in Hollywood."
13:42;13:43;"Solo?"
13:43;13:47;"I was meeting with somebody I work with, and I was kind of like--"
13:47;13:49;"you know, for kind of like a work lunch."
13:49;13:50;"Yeah."
13:50;13:51;"Or work breakfast."
13:51;13:53;"And they were just kind of like, ""Where's good to meet?"""
13:53;13:54;"And I was like, ""Where are you at?"""
13:54;13:55;"And they told me, and I was like, ""Thought about it."""
13:55;13:57;"And I was like, ""I've had that IHOP on Sunset."""
13:57;13:59;"Wow. So you marked it."
13:59;14:01;"You were like, ""I know there's an IHOP there."""
14:01;14:04;"Yeah, because I have a soft spot for IHOP, so I wanted to go to it."
14:04;14:08;"And I went, and I was like, you know, I'm kind of on an elite athlete diet."
14:08;14:11;"But I was like, you know, going to IHOP, maybe I'll--"
14:11;14:13;"got to have some pancakes."
14:13;14:17;"And this is my thought after not having had IHOP pancakes for probably 10 years."
14:17;14:19;"I said, ""You know what? This is a damn good pancake."""
14:19;14:21;"[explosion]"
14:21;14:23;"It's fluffy. It's enjoyable."
14:23;14:25;"I don't think the maple syrup is that good."
14:25;14:26;"I believe that."
14:26;14:29;"The maple syrup tasted a little chemical-y to me."
14:29;14:31;"I'm not saying there's chemicals in it, but it's just like--"
14:31;14:33;"this is a very good pancake."
14:33;14:37;"If it just had a slightly higher quality maple syrup, we'd be in business."
14:37;14:39;"Real maple syrup is pricey."
14:39;14:45;"And actually, the more I think about it, that IHOP had a coffee kiosk."
14:45;14:47;"There's no way that IHOP didn't have black ice coffee."
14:47;14:50;"So maybe this is just the Agoura Hills location, doesn't do ice coffee."
14:50;14:52;"I go to IHOP every weekend."
14:52;14:53;"Really?"
14:53;14:55;"Yeah, I have a 6-year-old son."
14:55;14:56;"Does he love it?"
14:56;14:58;"He begs to go."
14:58;14:59;"What does he get there? Pancakes?"
14:59;15:01;"Funny-faced pancakes."
15:01;15:05;"Is this a thing in American culture where pancakes are something that--"
15:05;15:10;"I know we've talked about this kind of insane thing how men don't really cook"
15:10;15:12;"except for manning the grill."
15:12;15:13;"Right."
15:13;15:15;"I know these things are changing, but that was an old stereotype."
15:15;15:19;"Is there also a bit of a thing that daddy makes pancakes?"
15:19;15:20;"Yeah, that's pretty classic."
15:20;15:22;"So Nick, why do you take your son to--"
15:22;15:24;"how come daddy doesn't make pancakes?"
15:24;15:26;"Do you not know how to make pancakes?"
15:26;15:27;"I can make pancakes."
15:27;15:28;"They're just not as good."
15:28;15:29;"And I'll do it."
15:29;15:32;"He really prefers the sort of--"
15:32;15:36;"I mean, it's almost like a divorced dad, though I'm not divorced."
15:36;15:39;"I feel like he's into the dad takes him out to eat,"
15:39;15:42;"mom can't stand IHOP so she doesn't go."
15:42;15:43;"You know what I mean?"
15:43;15:47;"Oh, so this is more of a daddy's little secret."
15:47;15:51;"Daddy can make pancakes, but it is daddy's little secret."
15:51;15:56;"Hey, what did my two guys get up to this morning for breakfast?"
15:56;15:58;"You just look at your son."
15:58;15:59;"Shh."
16:09;16:25;"is like coming down. I just had somebody tell me I was introspective to a fault. I'd be a loser if I can. But I will contend to be right now for us to keep our secret."
16:32;16:48;"You could tell me all your secrets. All you wanna do is run and hide. Just keep it inside. You could tell me all your secrets. All you wanna do is let it ride. Keep it inside."
16:48;17:07;"But if it does it seems and I keep having dreams about the two of us, then it's obvious you should stop treating me like I was just a child. Stop treating me like I was just as
wild as you."
17:07;17:23;"[Instrumental]"
17:23;17:40;"The snippet of your cradle is like coming down. I just had somebody tell me I was introspective to a fault. I'd be a loser if I can. But I will contend to be right now for us to
keep our secret."
17:40;17:47;"[Instrumental]"
17:47;18:08;"We could be a little closer. The mystery you're trying to preserve. Just get a little closer. We could get a little closer. Intimacy has the greatest charm. We would do
no harm to give a little way. Oh, please stop, hold and sway."
18:08;18:30;"Oh, you could even read me your poetry. If you could stop treating me like I was just a child. Stop treating me like I was just as wild as you. Stop treating me like I was just
a child."
18:30;18:43;"Child. Just a child. Just a child."
18:43;18:55;"So anyway, Jake, IHOP stands for International House of Pancakes. Yeah. And they really got people talking because they announced that they were changing their name
to IHOB."
18:55;19:08;"Yeah, that was big. That was big. And actually, I'm looking at a New York Times article that says IHOB promotes burgers by changing, in quotes, name to IHOB gets
reaction. A 21st century marketing success story."
19:08;19:20;"So this is already being hailed as a successful marketing. Well, didn't they do it that the B was a secret? It would be revealed later. Yeah, so they were like, we're
changing the name to IHOB. Can you guess what the B stands for?"
19:20;19:32;"I would have thought breakfast. That's what a lot of people thought. And then they announced that the B stands for burgers. That's so weak. And I guess at a few
locations, they changed the signs."
19:32;19:46;"There's so many burgers already. And we don't need more burgers. And they already had burgers, right? This wasn't a new thing. They just want people to be aware that
they have burgers. I would have assumed they did. I think maybe 24 hours."
19:46;19:57;"Maybe they have a new selection of burgers. They're rebranding their. So basically, this is always a big gambit just to get people to focus on their burgers. Oh, my God.
And guess what? Sales are through the roof."
19:57;20:13;"Actually, I don't know. They're calling this a success just because a lot of people talked about it. But are people coming in the door? I don't want to know. You just go to
the IHOB. A bunch of teens are like, dude, we should go eat a burger at IHOB. That'd be hilarious."
20:13;20:36;"But OK, so only one location on Sunset Boulevard. Oh, that one had undergone a design change in response to the new fake name. OK, so the product is not as regular
burgers. These are ultimate steak burgers. See, I didn't even know that. I'm a social media user. All I knew was that the B stood for burgers. I didn't know these are for
ultimate steak burgers."
20:36;20:50;"OK, IHOB has burgers. Who cares? Yeah. Ultimate steak burgers. You could just make it more interesting. This is the craziest part of this article about the marketing
success story. It's a two hour wait."
20:50;21:06;"Brad Haley, IHOB's chief marketing officer. I love that. The CMO of IHOB said that the idea had been proposed by the marketing firm Droga 5. That's one word, Droga. And
then the number five. This is the craziest part to me."
21:06;21:27;"Droga 5 had originally pitched a campaign based on the idea of pancakes, pancakes, pancakes, Mr. Haley said. So we said, that's great. We agree with that approach,
obviously. And we subsequently hired them. But we said there will come times when we want to promote something other than pancakes. They came back with the idea of
IHOB."
21:27;21:49;"So basically, holy cow. I guess I'll read some more. No pun intended. Mr. Haley said that the burgers were the most extensively tested new line of items that IHOB has
ever done. Tested. And that he expected them to be available for a long time. And while he spoke about the IHOB marketing campaign, which is set to wind down at the end of
the summer."
21:49;21:55;"Okay, so summer 2018 is the summer of IHOB. There is no song of the summer this year. Or the song of the summer is IHOB."
21:55;22:03;"Okay, we hit the IHOB, get the burgers, walk to the Dead Show. It's going to be a big, big night for us."
22:03;22:10;"Okay, we hit the Hollywood IHOB, walk seven miles to Dodger State and walk off those ultimate steak burgers."
22:10;22:12;"Hit that IHOB around 3.30 in the afternoon."
22:12;22:25;"Take down three to four. Wait, are we back on Modelo now? We got a comment on Instagram. I was on your Instagram saying something about how you stopped drinking Modelo.
And then somebody got in there, an American, who was just like, that's bulls***."
22:25;22:26;"Right, I saw that."
22:26;22:30;"This is a bunch of misinformation. Modelo treats their workers with fairness."
22:30;22:31;"Yeah."
22:31;22:33;"All right. Anyway."
22:33;22:34;"We're back on Modelo."
22:34;22:44;"So this is Mr. Haley, the CMO of IHOB, saying, ""Even though IHOB's campaign is going to wind down at the end of the summer, he was already looking forward to the days when
people would be nostalgic for it."""
22:44;22:47;"This person is insane."
22:47;22:52;"We'll certainly get back to promoting breakfast items. Mr. Haley, you're welcome to call in."
22:52;23:00;"We'll certainly get back to promoting breakfast items sometime after this, but I think IHOB will resurface at that point to harken back to this fun time people are
having right now."
23:00;23:02;"He's talking about IHOB like it's Pokemon Go."
23:02;23:03;"Yeah."
23:03;23:07;"Like this moment when everybody came to get... I don't know if people are feeling that way."
23:07;23:12;"But the part that really struck me was that they go to this hip New York advertising firm."
23:12;23:14;"Droga 5."
23:14;23:15;"So sinister."
23:15;23:22;"And Droga 5 pitches them a campaign based on the idea of pancakes, pancakes, pancakes."
23:22;23:23;"This is the funniest part."
23:23;23:27;"So we said, that's great. We agree with that approach, obviously. And we subsequently hired them."
23:27;23:29;"Yeah, that's genius, guys."
23:29;23:36;"You know what? They got to just reboot. We got to do a Mad Men that just like starts in 2003."
23:36;23:44;"It's just like so harsh. It sucks so bad. It has none of the glamor of the original Mad Men."
25:02;25:06;"So Brad Halley, we just got some info. He used to work at Hardee's."
25:06;25:09;"CKE, Carl Karcher Enterprises."
25:09;25:12;"Which is the company that owns Hardee's."
25:12;25:13;"Right. Carl's Jr."
25:13;25:18;"That makes this conversation even funnier. Brad Halley's sitting there with Droga 5."
25:18;25:21;"And Droga 5's like, you are now IHOP."
25:21;25:26;"IHOP? No, you mean IHOP. IHOP, International House of Burgers."
25:26;25:27;"Whoa."
25:27;25:31;"I'm actually getting chills right now. Did you know before this I worked at CKE?"
25:31;25:34;"No, I didn't know that. I have a background in burgers."
25:34;25:37;"[Laughter]"
25:37;25:40;"The hair on my arms is standing up right now."
25:40;25:44;"I've been wanting to do something with burgers ever since I jumped over to IHOP."
25:44;25:47;"I was in the burger trenches for 12 years."
25:47;25:52;"When I took the job at IHOP, I said to myself, Brad, your burger days are over, man."
25:52;25:56;"It's pancakes from here on out. This is going to be exciting."
25:56;26:00;"How did they get the New York Times just to say a marketing success story?"
26:00;26:03;"Why is it in the Times? That's a whole other conversation."
26:03;26:06;"I mean, all the news is fit to print. Paper of record."
26:06;26:10;"Isn't it funny that they just said, ""Gets reaction""?"
26:10;26:14;"It almost is like a click hole. News happens. People react."
26:14;26:19;"The actual headline is, ""IHOP promotes burgers by changing name to IHOP. Gets reaction."""
26:19;26:23;"And then underneath it says, ""A 21st century marketing success story."""
26:23;26:26;"Is that supposed to be ironic? They got a reaction?"
26:26;26:29;"Also, something's happening at the New York Times."
26:29;26:31;"The New York Times is getting little by little."
26:31;26:34;"You just see a touch more click hole throughout it."
26:34;26:37;"I guess the New York Times always had a bit of a fun story."
26:37;26:42;"Because also, look down here. I know that there's a concept that sometimes they tell you"
26:42;26:45;"when you're learning how to write essays of elegant variation."
26:45;26:50;"You know, where they're saying, to be a good writer, you don't repeat the same thing over and over again,"
26:50;26:53;"even though you might be talking about the same thing throughout an essay."

27:10;27:12;"I guess because it's a house."
27:12;27:13;"Yeah, but-"
27:13;27:15;"House means different things."
27:15;27:18;"Yeah. In this case, it means restaurant."

27:22;27:24;"Was this truly a success? Let's see some numbers."

40:25;40:27;"or build like a 70's style Taco Bell."
40:27;40:29;"Why don't they take it even further?"
40:29;40:32;"If you're a 5th tier burger place, yeah why not be like"
40:32;40:34;"we're not going to compete with the big boys."
40:34;40:37;"Let's make our whole thing that yeah we're like stuck in the 70's."
40:37;40:39;"Yeah."
40:39;40:40;"That'd be awesome."
40:40;40:41;"What do they have to lose?"
40:41;40:43;"And it's just like Bee Gees."
40:43;40:44;"Yeah."
40:44;40:46;"Just like the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack on at all times."
40:46;40:49;"Yeah just like pick like the ugliest uniform colors."
40:49;40:51;"Just like orange, brown."
40:51;40:52;"Yeah."
40:52;40:54;"We're stuck in the 70's."
40:54;40:56;"It wouldn't even cost that much."

43:45;43:47;"- You're listening to"
43:47;43:48;"(static buzzing)"
43:48;43:49;"- Time Crisis."
43:49;43:51;"- On Beat One."
43:51;43:52;"- Anyway."
43:52;43:52;"- Phoenix Idea."
43:52;43:54;"- So we saw another one of these conversations,"
43:54;43:59;"which I hate, where Wendy's talks some shit about IHOP."
43:59;44:01;"And then Moon Pie, for some reason,"
44:01;44:03;"Moon Pie's always on Wendy's (beep)."
44:03;44:04;"Like, Wendy's always talks some shit."
44:04;44:05;"- What's Moon Pie?"
44:05;44:08;"- You know, like those like, chocolate covered,"
44:08;44:08;"it's like a Southern--"
44:08;44:10;"- Oh, sure, okay."
44:10;44:13;"- But Wendy's said something about how,"
44:13;44:16;"okay, this is the whole conversation, now we have it up."
44:16;44:17;"- Corporations are people."
44:17;44:20;"- A guy said, ""So Wendy's, you just gonna let IHOP"
44:20;44:22;"""sell burgers on your block?"
44:22;44:23;"""I thought you were the OG."""
44:23;44:25;"So by the way, let's just also point out"
44:25;44:29;"that this guy's making a joke, which is funny, I guess,"
44:29;44:34;"that he's comparing IHOP and Wendy's to drug dealers."
44:34;44:35;"Fair comparison."
44:35;44:36;"- Fair enough."
44:36;44:37;"- I don't think it's a favorable comparison."
44:37;44:40;"So Wendy's chooses to respond to this,"
44:40;44:42;"and says, ""Not really afraid of the burgers"
44:42;44:45;"""from a place that decided pancakes were too hard."""
44:45;44:46;"- Wow."
44:47;44:48;"- Aggro."
44:48;44:50;"- 65,000 retweets."
44:50;44:54;"And then Moon Pie, Moon Pie's so (beep) lame."
44:54;44:56;"Then Moon Pie has to jump in the mix."
44:56;44:58;"- Fired up here today, dude."
44:58;44:59;"- Wendy's, this is so good."
44:59;45:01;"258 retweets."
45:01;45:03;"Really, Moon Pie?"
45:03;45:04;"You had to embarrass yourself?"
45:04;45:05;"- Brown nosing."
45:05;45:09;"- By brown nosing Wendy's for 258 retweets?"
45:09;45:11;"And then Wendy's writes back, crying, laughing emoji."
45:11;45:12;"""Thanks, Moon Pie."""
45:12;45:14;"And then Pop Tarts gets in the mix and says,"
45:14;45:15;"""Moon Pie."""
45:15;45:16;"- Oh no."
45:16;45:17;"- Yes."
45:17;45:19;"Moon Pie, I second that."
45:19;45:21;"And Wendy's great work."
45:21;45:22;"A plus, you've earned your pay."
45:22;45:24;"Can we all go home now?"
45:24;45:25;"And then Wendy says, ""This is our home now."
45:25;45:27;"""We live here forever."""
45:27;45:29;"And then Moon Pie said, ""Oh no."""
45:29;45:30;"I think I made this point last time."
45:30;45:32;"When I see stuff like this,"
45:32;45:33;"I used to see stuff like this"
45:33;45:35;"and it made me hate corporations."
45:35;45:36;"And then the more I thought about it,"
45:36;45:38;"it just makes me hate people."
45:38;45:42;"These idiotic, fake brand conversations"
45:42;45:43;"that they're having,"
45:43;45:45;"the reason why it's so easy for brands to do this"
45:45;45:49;"is because when people do this on social media,"
45:49;45:50;"they are becoming brands."
45:50;45:51;"So it's not even like the brands"
45:51;45:53;"are pretending to be people."
45:53;45:54;"- Right."
45:54;45:57;"- They're just doing this weird corporate branding"
45:57;45:58;"that people do, you know what I mean?"
45:58;45:59;"- To brand themselves."
45:59;46:01;"- Yeah, so it's one thing to be like,"
46:01;46:03;"""Wendy, stop pretending you have a personality."""
46:03;46:04;"Where you could say that,"
46:04;46:06;"whereas it's almost more like,"
46:06;46:09;"""Hey, Frank, stop pretending that you're Wendy's."""
46:09;46:10;"You know what I mean?"
46:10;46:11;"- Yeah."
46:11;46:13;"- In some way, this idiotic conversation makes more sense"
46:13;46:16;"for a bunch of corporate Twitter accounts."
46:16;46:17;"You know what I mean?"
46:17;46:21;"- Yeah, as opposed to just between friends on Twitter."
46:21;46:23;"- Jake, this is so good."
46:23;46:25;"Thanks, Ezra Seinfeld."
46:25;46:26;"I second that."
46:26;46:27;"Great work, A+."
46:27;46:31;"Also, let's go backwards."
46:31;46:32;"This entire dumb conversation"
46:32;46:35;"between Wendy's, Moon Pie, and Pop Tarts"
46:35;46:38;"was precipitated by Tony X's joke"
46:38;46:41;"about Wendy's being a rival drug dealer"
46:41;46:43;"that should go murder IHOP"
46:43;46:46;"for daring to sell product on their block."

49:20;49:23;"Whatever it can be made very cheap with high profit margin."
49:23;49:24;"- Gorilla glue."
49:24;49:25;"- Gorilla glue."
49:25;49:29;"And the entire ad campaign that we do is just social media."
49:29;49:31;"And whenever we see a conversation like this,"
49:31;49:33;"we get in the mix with all these brands say,"
49:33;49:35;"""Shut the up, you're just brands."
49:35;49:38;"""Follow me or you'd be the villain of this world."""
49:38;49:41;"Like next time Wendy's and Burger King get into a beef,"
49:41;49:42;"just get in there and just be like,"
49:42;49:43;"""Both you shut the up."
49:43;49:45;"""You're both losers."
49:45;49:46;"""Shut the up."""
49:46;49:47;"(laughs)"
49:47;49:48;"- The aggro."
49:48;49:51;"- So we should make a brand."
49:51;49:51;"- I think it has to be food."
49:51;49:53;"'Cause it's mostly food brands who get into this stuff."
49:53;49:54;"- Right, right, right."
49:54;49:56;"So we have to make like our own time crisis food brand."
49:56;49:58;"- Time crisis burgers."
49:58;49:59;"- Very straightforward."
49:59;50:00;"- And maybe our thing is that--"
50:00;50:01;"- TCB, dude."
50:01;50:03;"- Our whole thing is that,"
50:03;50:05;"you know like Wendy's does all that (beep) about,"
50:05;50:08;"they claim their burgers are fresh, but they're frozen."
50:08;50:09;"Our whole thing will be,"
50:09;50:10;"no actually maybe we hire a guy."
50:10;50:11;"- I like it."
50:11;50:13;"- We hire, okay."
50:13;50:13;"You with me?"
50:13;50:14;"We hire a guy."
50:14;50:15;"- Yeah, we hire a guy."
50:15;50:16;"- Which is like a good guy's name."
50:16;50:17;"- Frank."
50:17;50:18;"- Okay, Frank."
50:18;50:20;"- He's Frank, but it kind of stuck with me."
50:20;50:23;"- Okay, Frank Cavanaugh, Irish."
50:23;50:24;"A lot of Irish Americans."
50:24;50:26;"So Frank Cavanaugh,"
50:26;50:27;"it's called Frank Cavanaugh Burgers."
50:27;50:31;"And the whole thing is that Frank is the face of the company"
50:31;50:32;"and he does the social media."
50:32;50:33;"And our whole thing will be like,"
50:33;50:37;"a lot of these brands develop these fake personalities,"
50:37;50:40;"but behind closed doors, it's not fresh."
50:40;50:42;"It's a whole team of 23 year olds."
50:42;50:44;"Frank Cavanaugh does his own social media."
50:44;50:48;"We don't need a whole team of New York, Brooklyn hipsters"
50:48;50:50;"running our social media account."
50:50;50:54;"One man, one burger, one social media account."
50:54;50:55;"And be like, hey Wendy's,"
50:55;50:58;"you hide behind this drawing of a girl with red hair,"
50:58;51:01;"post a picture of your social media team."
51:01;51:02;"Cause ours is our banner."
51:02;51:03;"It's Frank Cavanaugh."
51:03;51:04;"Frank Cavanaugh Burger."
51:04;51:05;"You know what I mean?"
51:05;51:07;"They want to play this stupid game."
51:07;51:10;"This is the edgiest time crisis ever."
51:10;51:14;"I think our guy's kind of like the Punisher."
51:14;51:15;"- Frank Castle."
51:15;51:16;"- Frank Castle."
51:16;51:18;"- Punisher Burgers?"
51:18;51:18;"- I think maybe this..."
51:18;51:21;"(laughing)"
51:21;51:23;"- I feel like we need like a real brand name."
51:23;51:25;"Not just some dude's name."
51:25;51:27;"- Oh, well, I mean, this could be part of the MCU."
51:27;51:28;"- Great tie-in."
51:28;51:30;"- Okay."
51:30;51:32;"- But as people saw Punisher Burgers on Twitter,"
51:32;51:33;"they'd be like, what's that?"
51:33;51:34;"Like they would, you know."
51:34;51:36;"- Punisher Burgers."
51:36;51:37;"Who's the Punisher?"
51:37;51:37;"It's me."
51:37;51:39;"- Frank Castle."
51:39;51:42;"- We have to find a real guy named Frank Castle"
51:42;51:44;"who obviously we wouldn't make this happen,"
51:44;51:46;"but we do need to find a guy named Frank Castle"
51:46;51:47;"whose family was murdered."
51:47;51:52;"It's almost like a, what was that old Charles Bronson movie?"
51:52;51:53;"Death Wish."
51:53;51:53;"- Right."
51:53;51:56;"- One righteous person."
51:56;51:57;"Notice I said person."
51:57;51:58;"'Cause this is 2018."
51:58;52:00;"They gotta be a female Death Wish."
52:00;52:01;"Come on, Hollywood."
52:01;52:03;"Anyway, one person."
52:03;52:06;"- We kinda see women killing people on screen."
52:06;52:07;"- It's time."
52:07;52:12;"But I like the idea that all these corny-ass fast food brands"
52:12;52:14;"who pretend to have a voice"
52:14;52:18;"when really it's a room full of out of touch coastal elites"
52:18;52:24;"with degrees from Vassar brainstorming this horse (beep)"
52:24;52:26;"I like the idea that just like in Death Wish"
52:26;52:26;"or the Punisher."
52:26;52:28;"- I'm swearing on the Twitter account."
52:28;52:32;"- I like the idea that it's just one person."
52:32;52:34;"All they have is righteous indignation."
52:34;52:35;"- Punisher burgers, dude."
52:35;52:38;"- Punisher burgers say, ""Hey, Wendy's,"
52:38;52:39;"""you're named after a girl."
52:39;52:41;"""How come you got 40 people"
52:41;52:43;"""in your social media department?"
52:43;52:44;"""You wanna know who makes Punisher burgers?"
52:44;52:45;"""You wanna know who the Punisher is?"
52:45;52:47;"""It's me, Frank."
52:47;52:48;"""I'm one guy."

52:49;52:53;"Also, there's like a weird fixation on Vassar in this."
52:53;52:55;"And then we'll do some kind of activation"

59:53;59:55;"- And for the first six months,"
59:55;59:56;"actually, we could do this."
59:56;59:58;"We could just pretend this all happened."
59:58;59:59;"For this first six months, we're--"
59:59;01:00:00;"- Oh, we can just pretend."
01:00:00;01:00:02;"(laughing)"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"Like, this will ever come up again."

01:00:05;01:00:07;"(laughing)"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"- I was just saying that we were talking"
01:00:09;01:00:12;"at Dave's show the other night about how"
01:00:12;01:00:15;"time crisis is so weird because we do it every two weeks."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"It's just enough time to forget that it exists."
01:00:17;01:00:18;"- Yeah."
01:00:18;01:00:19;"Never remember what we talked about before."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"- We just come in here."
01:00:21;01:00:22;"We just say all this crazy shit we forget."
01:00:22;01:00:25;"And I was saying how when we announced the Ohi shows"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"and we said that we're doing two shows,"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"that a few people in the comments were like,"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"""Oh, is this the Twix shows?"""
01:00:30;01:00:32;"And I really had to rack my brain to remember what it--"
01:00:32;01:00:33;"- What?"
01:00:33;01:00:34;"- Yeah."
01:00:34;01:00:35;"- Wait, do you guys remember this?"
01:00:35;01:00:35;"- Yes."
01:00:35;01:00:37;"- Okay, so we did a joke on time crisis"
01:00:37;01:00:40;"that we were riffing on how Phish did 13 shows in a row"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"with no song repeats."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"And that's called the Baker's Dozen."
01:00:44;01:00:48;"And we said that Vampire Weekend could do two shows in a row"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"with no repeats and it would be the Twix."
01:00:50;01:00:52;"And we get Twix to pay for it."
01:00:52;01:00:53;"(laughing)"
01:00:53;01:00:53;"- Of course."
01:00:53;01:00:56;"- And whatever, it's left Twix and right Twix night."
01:00:56;01:00:57;"- Yeah."
01:00:57;01:00:57;"- Whatever you vote."
01:00:57;01:01:01;"And you know, you enter to win a sweatshirt"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"or something like that."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"- Vampire Weekend, Twix sweatshirt."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"- But anyway, at first people were talking about this"
01:01:06;01:01:09;"and I was like, Twix, what is that?"
01:01:09;01:01:10;"Like, I was like, that's funny."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"And I really just--"
01:01:12;01:01:12;"- Yeah, you didn't remember."
01:01:12;01:01:14;"- I could understand the idea."
01:01:14;01:01:14;"- I didn't remember either."
01:01:14;01:01:15;"- But I just don't remember talking about it."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"Anyway, that's what time crisis is like."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"But not Punisher Burgers."
01:01:18;01:01:21;"Punisher Burgers starts and it's real."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"And for the first six months, you come out swinging"
01:01:23;01:01:27;"very simple, elegant burgers and design."
01:01:27;01:01:30;"And we just come out and just immediately,"
01:01:30;01:01:32;"we're threatening Wendy's on Twitter."
01:01:32;01:01:34;"Every time they try to do one of their cutesy"
01:01:34;01:01:36;"little conversations, we just get in there"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"and just say-- - Shutting them down."
01:01:38;01:01:39;"- Guys, cut the crap."
01:01:39;01:01:42;"You're a room full of Vassar grads."
01:01:42;01:01:44;"And every single one of them,"
01:01:44;01:01:45;"we just see a room full of Vassar grads."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"- Yeah."
01:01:46;01:01:47;"- Cut the crap."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"And then--"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"- You wanna talk burgers, come down to our location."
01:01:50;01:01:50;"- Come down to our location."
01:01:50;01:01:52;"- On Eagle Rock Boulevard."
01:01:52;01:01:53;"- Exactly."
01:01:53;01:01:56;"And then six months in, it flops."
01:01:56;01:01:59;"And then those Vassar grads at Wendy's do something like,"
01:01:59;01:02:00;"they'll do some meme."
01:02:00;01:02:04;"- So we're planning from the get-go for the burger--"
01:02:04;01:02:06;"- Business to fail."
01:02:06;01:02:06;"- Yeah."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"- Okay, this is a long con."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"- This is a long con."
01:02:09;01:02:12;"And then Wendy's and Burger King and whoever--"
01:02:12;01:02:13;"- Just pile on."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"- They're just doing pile on."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"They're just doing memes about like,"
01:02:16;01:02:20;"oh man, yeah, another one of those key,"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"they would try to turn around on us,"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"another keyboard gangster who talked a lot"
01:02:24;01:02:25;"but just couldn't sell burgers."
01:02:25;01:02:26;"I guess that's that."
01:02:26;01:02:28;"I guess you'll be packing it up."
01:02:28;01:02:30;"Then just the next day, shut the (beep) up."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"And they'll be like, aren't you out of business?"
01:02:34;01:02:38;"Be like, yeah, we don't sell burgers anymore."

01:03:26;01:03:28;"So people are talking about this."

01:03:46;01:03:47;"- Right."
01:03:47;01:03:49;"- For like the Eagle Rock location."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"- And also just, yeah, 'cause then we actually,"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"we would say to Wendy's like, all right guys,"
01:03:53;01:03:56;"maybe I'm not as good as business at you, as you."
01:03:56;01:03:59;"I'm not owned by a, you know, a giant corporation."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"I don't have international capital flowing in."
01:04:02;01:04:05;"And our final location, the Eagle Rock location,"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"the original is now closed."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"And then they'll say what they're gonna say"
01:04:09;01:04:10;"and say like, all right, you won."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"And then a couple of days later, that's when we come back,"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"be like, but now I got nothing to lose."

01:17:03;01:17:05;"Maybe we gotta take people to Ojai with us."
01:17:05;01:17:07;"- Gonna hit the road."
01:17:07;01:17:09;"- So we're gonna have some on the ground coverage"
01:17:09;01:17:11;"of Father's Day weekend in Ojai"
01:17:11;01:17:14;"with some of our friends and fans and people like that."
01:17:14;01:17:16;"So not time for a top five today."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"- Okay, take a breather on the top five."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"- Take a breather on the top five."

01:17:24;01:17:28;"- I just wanna do another 20 on P Burgers."
01:17:28;01:17:31;"So you were saying about maybe Punisher Burgers"
01:17:31;01:17:34;"should also just tweet at regular people, at civilians."
01:17:34;01:17:35;"You know, it's cool."
01:17:35;01:17:38;"We could take a lot of the Punisher Burgers storylines"
01:17:38;01:17:39;"from the comics."
01:17:39;01:17:41;"(laughing)"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"That happens a lot with like these anti-heroes."
01:17:43;01:17:45;"At first, they're going against the system."
01:17:45;01:17:46;"And then holy, why is Punisher Burgers"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"being so mean to random people?"
01:17:48;01:17:52;"And Punisher Burgers, after we finally take down Wendy's"
01:17:52;01:17:54;"and like get them to deactivate their account,"
01:17:54;01:17:55;"that should be like a big storyline."
01:17:55;01:17:58;"That's our Infinity War is getting Wendy's to deactivate."
01:17:59;01:18:03;"That then, but then Punisher Burgers is like so unchained"
01:18:03;01:18:06;"that it just starts finding anything on social media"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"of people making burgers at home."

01:18:17;01:18:19;"Then it's like this angry ghost"
01:18:19;01:18:23;"that for years afterwards can never get over"
01:18:23;01:18:27;"the loss of the original four Punisher Burger locations."
01:18:27;01:18:27;"- Oh my God."
01:18:27;01:18:29;"- And just carries this anger with it"
01:18:29;01:18:32;"that anytime it sees anybody doing anything with a burger."
01:18:32;01:18:33;"- Any joy."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"- Any joy."
01:18:35;01:18:36;"You know what, Jason?"
01:18:36;01:18:40;"It's pricks like you, these self-satisfied,"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"daddy grilling some burgers type guys"
01:18:42;01:18:45;"who led to the loss of my beloved Punisher Burgers."
01:18:45;01:18:48;"- You're rubbing my loss in my face every day."
01:18:48;01:18:49;"- Right."
01:18:49;01:18:52;"Okay, that's enough Punisher Burgers."
01:18:52;01:18:54;"All right, dude, it's time to jump in the van"

01:25:39;01:25:42;"Well, I haven't been on the road in a long time."
01:25:42;01:25:44;"But, you know, I think at like a Kanye show,"
01:25:44;01:25:46;"long sleeves are going to run you about $120."
01:25:46;01:25:48;"Yeah, $120, $125."

01:25:51;01:25:53;"So what do you think? We're underselling you guys, or what's up?"
01:25:53;01:25:56;"-Should we pump it up to $30? -I think you guys should sell"
01:25:56;01:25:59;"outside of the purview of the venue."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"Oh, it's Shakedown Street, baby. We're doing it."
01:26:01;01:26:02;"Cool."
01:26:02;01:26:06;"And I know Seinfeld's bringing some 8-Minute Cape Cods, so..."
01:26:06;01:26:09;"-Great. -How much is it selling those for?"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"That's a good question."
01:26:11;01:26:13;"I don't know."
01:26:13;01:26:15;"But, yeah, definitely get out--"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"start a Shakedown Street out there."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"There might be a couple other shirts, too."
01:26:19;01:26:20;"We'll see."
01:26:20;01:26:23;"Our boys are just trying to undercut anything that you do."
01:26:23;01:26:25;"That's it. They're trying to--"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"-We got to move this merch. -Yeah."
01:26:27;01:26:31;"We're a cover band, so I feel like the merch should be..."
01:26:31;01:26:32;"-Illegitimate. -Honest."
01:26:32;01:26:34;"Yeah."
01:26:34;01:26:36;"Wait, how many shirts did you guys make?"
01:26:36;01:26:40;"We're selling about 100. We made 125. We'll give out 25."
01:26:40;01:26:43;"Over two days? Yeah, that's a reason-- 50 a night for 50 a day?"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"-Yeah. -That's reasonable."
01:26:45;01:26:47;"12 out of 1,200 people a day, right?"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"And if there's any-- I also wonder--"
01:26:49;01:26:51;"We heard some rumors of at least a couple people couldn't get tickets,"
01:26:51;01:26:54;"just going to post up in the park, enjoy the sweet sounds."
01:26:54;01:26:58;"So maybe they would be even more likely to grab a shirt on the way out."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"-Like I was there. -Right, exactly."
01:27:00;01:27:02;"[laughter]"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"All right, I got to go soundcheck."
01:27:04;01:27:06;"-Thanks, Ezra. -Good luck for having us."

01:27:14;01:27:15;"It's fine."
01:27:15;01:27:17;"It's going to be a scuffle out there."
01:27:17;01:27:19;"Look, don't stress, man."
01:27:19;01:27:22;"It's going to be a really great weekend."
01:27:22;01:27:24;"The shirts will get sold."
01:27:24;01:27:27;"Every person here is going to have one of these shirts on their back."
01:27:27;01:27:29;"All 1,200 people both days."
01:28:30;01:28:32;"How is this show different than a typical--"
01:28:32;01:28:34;"even just in the size, the audience?"
01:28:34;01:28:37;"There aren't seats, usually, at a Richard Pictures show?"
01:28:37;01:28:41;"I would also say that the audience generally knows the material at one of our shows."
01:28:41;01:28:45;"Tonight, I'm not so sure how many people are going to know any of these songs."
01:28:45;01:28:50;"There's basically no similarity between a Richard Pictures show and a Vampire Weekend show."
01:28:50;01:28:52;"This is a big gig for us."
01:28:52;01:28:53;"Yes."
01:28:53;01:28:55;"This is our biggest gig."
01:28:55;01:28:57;"Are there more nerves around a gig like this?"
01:28:57;01:28:58;"Yep, absolutely."
01:28:58;01:28:59;"Great question."
01:28:59;01:29:00;"Not ashamed to admit it."
01:29:00;01:29:01;"I'll be a little nervous."
01:29:01;01:29:04;"My dad saw King Crimson open up for the Eagles once."
01:29:04;01:29:05;"Wow."
01:29:05;01:29:06;"Yeah."
01:29:06;01:29:07;"In San Ho."
01:29:07;01:29:08;"Wow."
01:29:08;01:29:09;"What year?"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"I don't know, early Eagles."
01:29:10;01:29:11;"Really?"
01:29:11;01:29:12;"Yeah, I think it was Crimson's--"
01:29:12;01:29:14;"Oh, you know what? Eagles were opening."
01:29:14;01:29:15;"That makes more sense if it's early."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"Yeah, a quarter of the Crimson King tour."
01:29:17;01:29:18;"Wow."
01:29:18;01:29:19;"Eagles opener."
01:29:19;01:29:21;"Didn't like it."
01:29:21;01:29:22;"My dad didn't."
01:29:22;01:29:25;"I bet the King Crimson crowd was not in love with the Eagles."
01:29:25;01:29:26;"[laughter]"
01:29:26;01:29:27;"No, no, no."
01:29:27;01:29:29;"I bet that didn't go over too well."
01:29:29;01:29:30;"We don't know."
01:29:30;01:29:31;"We can't know."
01:29:31;01:29:33;"Okay, so the crew's going to head out and start hawking those wares."
01:29:33;01:29:35;"From the crew, we got to go."
01:29:35;01:29:36;"Thanks, Time Crisis."
01:29:36;01:29:37;"Thanks for having us."
01:29:37;01:29:39;"On behalf of Adam and Mikey and myself, Chris."
01:29:39;01:29:40;"Thank you, Chris."
01:29:40;01:29:42;"Thank you, Time, Chris."
01:29:50;01:29:53;"There's mosquitoes on the river."
01:29:53;01:29:58;"Fisher rising up like birds."
01:29:58;01:30:02;"It's been hot for seven weeks now."
01:30:02;01:30:04;"Too hot to even speak now."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"Did you hear what I just heard?"
01:30:06;01:30:13;"Say it might have been a bit of heat."
01:30:13;01:30:17;"Or it could have been the wind."
01:30:17;01:30:20;"But there seems to be a beat now."
01:30:20;01:30:22;"I can feel it in my feet now."
01:30:22;01:30:28;"Listen, here it comes again."
01:30:28;01:30:32;"There's a man down in the hallway."
01:30:32;01:30:37;"The house is in his hands."
01:30:37;01:30:41;"It's a rainbow full of sun."
01:30:41;01:30:45;"It's blinding, it's giving people smiles."
01:30:45;01:30:55;"Everybody's dancing."
01:30:55;01:30:56;"Come on, cheer."
01:30:57;01:31:04;"Come on, cheer."
01:31:04;01:31:08;"The sun went down in honey."
01:31:08;01:31:12;"And the moon came up in wine."
01:31:12;01:31:15;"You know the stars were spinning dizzy."
01:31:15;01:31:17;"Lord, the band kept us so busy."
01:31:17;01:31:30;"We forgot about the time."
01:31:30;01:31:34;"They're a band beyond description."
01:31:34;01:31:39;"Like Jehovah's favorite choir."
01:31:39;01:31:41;"People joining hand in hand."
01:31:41;01:31:44;"While the music plays the band."
01:31:44;01:31:48;"The band is setting us on fire."
01:31:48;01:31:52;"Crazy rooster crowing midnight."
01:31:52;01:31:57;"Balls of lightning roll along."
01:31:57;01:32:00;"Old men sing about their dreams."
01:32:00;01:32:02;"Women laugh and children scream."
01:32:02;01:32:07;"And the band keeps playing on."
01:32:07;01:32:09;"Keep on dancing."
01:32:09;01:32:11;"Keep on dancing through the daylight."
01:32:11;01:32:16;"Weeping souls."
01:32:16;01:32:20;"Look the band's all packed and gone."
01:32:20;01:32:23;"Wasn't there a choir here at all?"
01:32:23;01:32:33;"But they kept on dancing."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"Come on, cheer."
01:32:34;01:32:36;"Come on, cheer."
01:32:36;01:32:42;"Come on, clap your hands."
01:32:42;01:32:46;"Well, the cool breeze came on Tuesday."
01:32:46;01:32:51;"And the corn's a bumper crop."
01:32:51;01:32:53;"And the fields are full of dancing."
01:32:53;01:32:56;"Full of singing and romancing."
01:32:56;01:33:21;"The music never stops."
01:33:21;01:33:22;"So I'm Nick."
01:33:22;01:33:24;"I'm one of the producers on Time Crisis"
01:33:24;01:33:27;"that you often don't hear sometimes I'm referred to."
01:33:27;01:33:29;"But I'm on mic."
01:33:29;01:33:30;"Behind the scenes."
01:33:30;01:33:31;"I'm more behind the scenes."
01:33:31;01:33:32;"Yeah."
01:33:32;01:33:33;"Very uncomfortable."
01:33:33;01:33:34;"On mic now."
01:33:34;01:33:35;"Visibly nervous."
01:33:35;01:33:36;"Visibly nervous on mic."
01:33:36;01:33:38;"In front of the scenes."
01:33:38;01:33:40;"So we're now in the Vampire Weekend dressing room."
01:33:40;01:33:43;"You can hear Vampire Weekend sound checking in the back."
01:33:43;01:33:44;"I'm here with Jake."
01:33:44;01:33:45;"Hey."
01:33:45;01:33:48;"Hey, and guess who -- look who we found."
01:33:48;01:33:51;"We found Time Crisis, I would say,"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"one of the original members."
01:33:53;01:33:55;"OG Time Crisis."
01:33:55;01:33:57;"Despot and Makonnen."
01:33:57;01:33:58;"Yes."
01:33:58;01:33:59;"Hi."
01:33:59;01:34:00;"There he is."
01:34:00;01:34:02;"So what are you guys doing here?"
01:34:02;01:34:04;"We're going to rap."
01:34:04;01:34:05;"You're going to rap?"
01:34:05;01:34:06;"Yeah."
01:34:06;01:34:09;"Maybe -- what song -- what are you going to rap?"
01:34:09;01:34:12;"What's the song that you all appear on together?"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"It's called ""Down for So Long."""
01:34:14;01:34:15;"It's a Makonnen song."
01:34:15;01:34:18;"And it's a remix that features me and Ezra Koenig"
01:34:18;01:34:21;"of Vampire Weekend and Time Crisis."
01:34:21;01:34:23;"That's a real, like, Time Crisis --"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"it's almost like a Time Crisis deep cut."
01:34:25;01:34:26;"Yeah."
01:34:26;01:34:29;"So let's talk about Ojai for a second."
01:34:29;01:34:31;"When did you guys get in?"
01:34:31;01:34:32;"I got in last night."
01:34:32;01:34:33;"Me too."
01:34:33;01:34:34;"You guys ever been here before?"
01:34:34;01:34:35;"No."
01:34:35;01:34:36;"Where do you live?"
01:34:36;01:34:39;"Downtown Los Angeles, unfortunately."
01:34:39;01:34:41;"He doesn't like it there."
01:34:41;01:34:42;"Not at all."
01:34:42;01:34:44;"I want to move back to Manhattan."
01:34:44;01:34:46;"Would you consider moving to Ojai?"
01:34:46;01:34:49;"It depends."
01:34:49;01:34:51;"It's a pretty chill vibe, but, you know,"
01:34:51;01:34:54;"I would have to maybe have a farm and stuff"
01:34:54;01:34:56;"to find something to do."
01:34:56;01:34:57;"Big fire risk."
01:34:57;01:34:58;"I heard about that."
01:34:58;01:34:59;"You could lose your house."
01:34:59;01:35:03;"I was talking to a fireman that might go fight fires today."
01:35:03;01:35:04;"Yeah, it's risky."
01:35:04;01:35:06;"I don't know, buying property up here and then it just --"
01:35:06;01:35:09;"Wait, so you moved from Manhattan to downtown L.A.?"
01:35:09;01:35:12;"No, I moved from Manhattan to Portland, Oregon."
01:35:12;01:35:13;"Oh, they live there."
01:35:13;01:35:15;"And then from Portland, Oregon to downtown L.A."
01:35:15;01:35:19;"and back to Manhattan for April 2019."
01:35:19;01:35:21;"Oh, you're moving back in a year."
01:35:21;01:35:22;"Yeah."
01:35:22;01:35:24;"Why downtown L.A., though?"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"I moved here for work, or there for work."
01:35:26;01:35:27;"Okay."
01:35:27;01:35:30;"And I just came for work,"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"and I think I'm about finished with my work."
01:35:32;01:35:33;"Yeah."
01:35:33;01:35:37;"I've always been mystified by the choice to live downtown as well."
01:35:37;01:35:41;"It seems like antithetical to, like, an L.A. experience."
01:35:41;01:35:42;"Yeah, it truly is."
01:35:42;01:35:43;"You know?"
01:35:43;01:35:45;"It's different than West L.A. and Hollywood and all that."
01:35:45;01:35:47;"That's like a whole other world."
01:35:47;01:35:49;"It's more like--it feels like a city, you know?"
01:35:49;01:35:50;"You can walk around."
01:35:50;01:35:52;"I always thought that was cool."
01:35:52;01:35:56;"Yeah, it just feels like New York before everybody came."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"Right, it's like it's still kind of f---ed up, even."
01:35:58;01:36:02;"Yeah, it's still trash on the floor and, like, crackheads everywhere."
01:36:02;01:36:03;"Right, yeah, I like that."
01:36:03;01:36:04;"Instead of grimy New York s---."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"I like to take a walk and see crackheads."
01:36:06;01:36:07;"Yeah."
01:36:07;01:36:08;"They're supposed to be there."
01:36:08;01:36:09;"You could do that in Hollywood, too."
01:36:09;01:36:10;"True, that's true."
01:36:10;01:36:11;"Yeah, that's true."
01:36:11;01:36:13;"Especially East Hollywood."
01:36:13;01:36:16;"They're the only people walking is crackheads in Hollywood."
01:36:16;01:36:19;"Anyone else is--I mean, that's it."
01:36:19;01:36:20;"Or drive."
01:36:20;01:36:21;"If you're walking, you're a crackhead."
01:36:21;01:36:24;"Yesterday I was in Hollywood, and I had some tacos,"
01:36:24;01:36:29;"and then I had to go to a Verizon store, and I was like, ""I'll walk."""
01:36:29;01:36:33;"It's just under a mile away, and everyone looks at you like you're crazy."
01:36:33;01:36:34;"I love that."
01:36:34;01:36:36;"If you're taking a long walk, they look at you--"
01:36:36;01:36:37;"Which street did you walk down?"
01:36:37;01:36:38;"--and holding a pipe."
01:36:38;01:36:39;"What?"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"Which street did you walk down?"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"Santa Monica."
01:36:43;01:36:44;"Oh, man."
01:36:44;01:36:45;"Yeah."
01:36:45;01:36:48;"I've never walked a mile on Santa Monica before."
01:36:48;01:36:49;"Never done it."
01:36:49;01:36:50;"It was fine."
01:36:50;01:36:52;"But, yeah, I got a lot of looks."
01:36:52;01:36:54;"And, you know, you see people hop out their cars."
01:36:54;01:36:57;"There was a cigar shop."
01:36:57;01:37:01;"I stood outside of it for a minute because I was having a heavy text moment,"
01:37:01;01:37:02;"and I didn't want to walk."
01:37:02;01:37:05;"So I was kind of leaning on the wall of the cigar spot, texting,"
01:37:05;01:37:09;"and watching the type of people who hop out at the cigar spot."
01:37:09;01:37:14;"It was like older men who are kind of big and nice loafers."
01:37:14;01:37:15;"Huh."
01:37:15;01:37:16;"Normal, Hollywood."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"And they look at me crazy."
01:37:17;01:37:19;"And, you know, they say hi."
01:37:19;01:37:20;"They're walking into the cigar spot."
01:37:20;01:37:22;"They're like, ""Hey, how you doing?"""
01:37:22;01:37:25;"Because I'm standing outside the store, and that's weird here, I guess,"
01:37:25;01:37:26;"whereas in New York--"
01:37:26;01:37:27;"No loitering, sir."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"--everybody stands outside the store."
01:37:28;01:37:29;"That's what you do."
01:37:29;01:37:30;"Yeah."
01:37:30;01:37:31;"It's fun."
01:37:31;01:37:34;"So just to set the scene, so you flew all the way across the country."
01:37:34;01:37:35;"Yes."
01:37:35;01:37:36;"Just looking out the window."
01:37:36;01:37:38;"No, you don't look out the window, if I remember correctly, right?"
01:37:38;01:37:39;"No, yeah."
01:37:39;01:37:40;"Yeah, I don't look out."
01:37:40;01:37:41;"You just stand straight ahead."
01:37:41;01:37:42;"And you don't read or watch anything."
01:37:42;01:37:44;"I remember this from a previous episode."
01:37:44;01:37:47;"How could you not look out the window?"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"That's one of the favorite parts of flying."
01:37:49;01:37:52;"So you're just staring at the back of the seat in front of you."
01:37:52;01:37:53;"Yeah."
01:37:53;01:37:55;"This time I slept a decent amount."
01:37:55;01:37:56;"If I can't sleep, I will sleep."
01:37:56;01:38:00;"But that's the only thing, activity, that I'll partake in."
01:38:00;01:38:02;"Nintendo Switch is fun."
01:38:02;01:38:03;"I don't have that."
01:38:03;01:38:04;"I don't know, man."
01:38:04;01:38:07;"I love video games, but I don't know what happened to me."
01:38:07;01:38:08;"I got too old."
01:38:08;01:38:09;"iPhone."
01:38:09;01:38:11;"I have a couple games on there."
01:38:11;01:38:13;"I have Snake vs. Block."
01:38:13;01:38:14;"On the plane."
01:38:14;01:38:15;"Yeah."
01:38:15;01:38:19;"You know, a friend of mine gave me a free GoGo Air password."
01:38:19;01:38:21;"He has the unlimited."
01:38:21;01:38:24;"And he was like, ""Yeah, just use it, and you could be on the internet."""
01:38:24;01:38:25;"And I don't use it."
01:38:25;01:38:27;"I respect that, man."
01:38:27;01:38:28;"I respect that, too."
01:38:28;01:38:31;"That means you come from a time when you witnessed real life happening."
01:38:31;01:38:35;"And nowadays, there's not a lot of life happening, unless it's online."
01:38:35;01:38:36;"Yeah, it's true."
01:38:36;01:38:39;"I try to--it's a little like meditation."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"A plane ride is a meditation."
01:38:41;01:38:42;"Yeah."
01:38:42;01:38:45;"So you take that flight."
01:38:45;01:38:47;"Don't say a word, staring straight ahead."
01:38:47;01:38:48;"No back view."
01:38:48;01:38:51;"And you land, and the first thing you do is go to the Verizon store."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"Yeah, second thing."
01:38:53;01:38:54;"I had tacos."
01:38:54;01:38:57;"[indistinct chatter]"
01:38:57;01:38:58;"Okay, cool."
01:38:58;01:39:00;"So we're about to lose these guys to go sound check."
01:39:00;01:39:01;"That's five minutes."
01:39:01;01:39:02;"That's a lot of time."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"That's like 30 questions."
01:39:04;01:39:06;"We're going to rap over this Weezer song."
01:39:06;01:39:07;"That's wild."
01:39:07;01:39:09;"Are they covering Weezer?"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"They want us to rap over this--"
01:39:11;01:39:12;"Oh, you're going to rap over this part?"
01:39:12;01:39:15;"Apparently, it feels a little slow."
01:39:15;01:39:17;"It does feel a little slow."
01:39:17;01:39:20;"All right, you guys are going on."
01:39:20;01:39:21;"Well, five minutes."
01:39:21;01:39:23;"We're going to go rap over Weezer right now."
01:39:37;01:39:43;"Somebody's hiding, drowning my icebox."
01:39:43;01:39:49;"Somebody's cold one, is giving me chills."
01:39:49;01:39:55;"Guess I'll just close my eyes."
01:39:55;01:39:58;"Oh, yeah."
01:39:58;01:40:01;"All right."
01:40:01;01:40:08;"Feels good inside."
01:40:08;01:40:14;"Flip on the telly, wrestle within me."
01:40:14;01:40:20;"Something is bubbling behind my back."
01:40:20;01:40:25;"The bottle is ready to blow."
01:40:25;01:40:34;"Say it ain't so."
01:40:34;01:40:42;"Your joke is a heartbreaker."
01:40:42;01:40:47;"Say it ain't so."
01:40:47;01:40:53;"My love is a life taker."
01:41:05;01:41:08;"I can't confront you."
01:41:08;01:41:11;"I never could do."
01:41:11;01:41:17;"That which might hurt you, to try and be cool."
01:41:17;01:41:20;"And I say, this way."
01:41:20;01:41:26;"There's a water slide away from me that takes a fool of every day."
01:41:26;01:41:28;"So be cool."
01:41:33;01:41:37;"Say it ain't so."
01:41:37;01:41:46;"Your joke is a heartbreaker."
01:41:46;01:41:50;"Say it ain't so."
01:41:50;01:41:56;"My love is a life taker."
01:41:56;01:41:59;"Dear daddy, I'm right too."
01:41:59;01:42:02;"In spite of it's a silence."
01:42:02;01:42:05;"You cleaned up, found Jesus."
01:42:05;01:42:08;"Things are good, oh so I hear."
01:42:08;01:42:15;"This bottle of Stevens awakens ancient feelings."
01:42:15;01:42:24;"Like father, stepfather, the sun is coming in the front."
01:42:24;01:42:26;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:42:26;01:42:28;"Yeah, yeah."
01:42:50;01:42:54;"Say it ain't so."
01:42:54;01:43:02;"Your joke is a heartbreaker."
01:43:02;01:43:06;"Say it ain't so."
01:43:06;01:43:12;"My love is a life taker."
01:43:12;01:43:14;"All right, we're hanging backstage."
01:43:14;01:43:17;"Libby Ball, Jake Sound checking."
01:43:17;01:43:20;"But we got C.T. Bay on death spot, hanging."
01:43:20;01:43:21;"What's up, fellas?"
01:43:21;01:43:22;"What's up?"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"Jake's sounding good."
01:43:24;01:43:25;"Oh, yeah."
01:43:25;01:43:27;"Richard Pictures, hell of a band."
01:43:27;01:43:29;"It's a really good band name."
01:43:29;01:43:30;"Yeah, you like that name?"
01:43:30;01:43:31;"Yeah."
01:43:31;01:43:33;"Do we know where they fall in the hierarchy of dead?"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"L.A.-based Grateful Dead bands?"
01:43:35;01:43:36;"Yeah."
01:43:36;01:43:39;"Well, they're definitely not the top band,"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"and I don't say that as a quality thing."
01:43:41;01:43:42;"No, no."
01:43:42;01:43:44;"Just because they're just a little more casual about it."
01:43:44;01:43:47;"But there's a band, and I've heard them play a little bit,"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"and they're very good, called Grateful Shred."
01:43:49;01:43:50;"Have you heard of them?"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"I mean, not as good of a name."
01:43:52;01:43:53;"The name's not as good."
01:43:53;01:43:54;"Kind of a lazy name."
01:43:54;01:43:55;"Oh, okay."
01:43:55;01:43:56;"Shots fired."
01:43:56;01:43:57;"Whatever, man."
01:43:57;01:43:58;"Declaring war."
01:43:58;01:43:59;"Yeah."
01:43:59;01:44:00;"But anyway, that band's good,"
01:44:00;01:44:01;"and they're just, like, out there more."
01:44:01;01:44:04;"Whereas Richard Pictures, you never know when you're going to catch a show."
01:44:04;01:44:07;"They're doing it for the love of the game more than the--"
01:44:07;01:44:11;"Yeah, like, Grateful Shred could be the next Dark Star for all we know,"
01:44:11;01:44:13;"and good for them."
01:44:13;01:44:17;"But, like, Richard Pictures is more like three to five shows a year kind of band."
01:44:17;01:44:20;"KT and I, we were at their last show,"
01:44:20;01:44:23;"and then we're seeing this show and tomorrow's show,"
01:44:23;01:44:24;"so it's three shows in a row."
01:44:24;01:44:25;"Oh, wow."
01:44:25;01:44:26;"We're on tour with them."
01:44:26;01:44:27;"Yeah."
01:44:27;01:44:29;"Which would Richard Pictures fans be called?"
01:44:29;01:44:31;"We're selling groceries in the parking lot."
01:44:31;01:44:32;"No, pick heads."
01:44:32;01:44:33;"Pick heads."
01:44:33;01:44:34;"[laughter]"
01:44:34;01:44:35;"And for people who don't remember,"
01:44:35;01:44:37;"Richard Pictures used to be called Dick Picks,"
01:44:37;01:44:39;"which is a reference to Dick's Picks,"
01:44:39;01:44:42;"Grateful Dead compilations."
01:44:42;01:44:45;"The archivist, like, his choice of the best shows."
01:44:45;01:44:49;"Right, his name was Dick and he would pick the best recordings."
01:44:49;01:44:51;"But then--so it was a witty name to be called Dick Picks,"
01:44:51;01:44:53;"but then a lot of people were like, you know,"
01:44:53;01:44:56;"that's not a very cool name right now or ever."
01:44:56;01:44:59;"And they were like, all right, Grateful Dead's music."
01:44:59;01:45:03;"That's f---ed up, though, because sometimes Dick Picks are about, like, love."
01:45:03;01:45:05;"That's true, you know?"
01:45:05;01:45:06;"Dick Picks are not always--"
01:45:06;01:45:07;"Solicited Dick Picks."
01:45:07;01:45:10;"Solicited--right, yeah, Solicited Dick Picks, that's a good band name."
01:45:10;01:45:11;"Great band name."
01:45:11;01:45:12;"[laughter]"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"Richard Pictures is better than Solicited Dick Picks."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"Solicited Richard Pictures."
01:45:16;01:45:17;"Okay, that's true."
01:45:17;01:45:20;"But either way, their fans could still be called d---heads."
01:45:20;01:45:21;"Yeah, d---heads."
01:45:21;01:45:22;"[laughter]"
01:45:22;01:45:23;"Still works, yeah."
01:45:23;01:45:25;"Desmond, you told me that you're not a deadhead,"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"but your parents kind of were."
01:45:27;01:45:30;"They were--they f---ed it, yeah, a little bit."
01:45:30;01:45:31;"I wouldn't call them deadheads."
01:45:31;01:45:32;"They were hippies."
01:45:32;01:45:33;"Fans. Oh, they're just hippies."
01:45:33;01:45:36;"Fans. But they got a bunch of dead records."
01:45:36;01:45:40;"That's how--because I used to see, like, the logo on cars all the time and s---,"
01:45:40;01:45:41;"and I was like, that's cool."
01:45:41;01:45:44;"And then I saw the records, and I was like, I'll listen to these,"
01:45:44;01:45:46;"and I was like, what the f--- is this s---?"
01:45:46;01:45:48;"[laughter]"
01:45:48;01:45:52;"Fair enough. Maybe Richard Pictures will turn around for you."
01:45:52;01:45:55;"Maybe. I mean, I'm getting older. Maybe it's okay."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"Right, you're mellowing out a little bit."
01:45:57;01:46:00;"You were probably, like, you know, angry 14-year-old back then."
01:46:00;01:46:03;"Nah, but, like, there was also, like, Steely Dan records,"
01:46:03;01:46:05;"and I was like, these are cool. I'll f--- with this."
01:46:05;01:46:07;"Okay, fair enough."
01:46:07;01:46:09;"You're more into precision, then."
01:46:09;01:46:10;"Yeah, there you go. Exactly."
01:46:10;01:46:12;"I don't like all this noodling around."
01:46:12;01:46:15;"Right. That happens when you get older. You want to noodle more."
01:46:15;01:46:19;"I still wouldn't say I'm much of a noodler, though."
01:46:19;01:46:21;"I got a regimen. I follow it."
01:46:21;01:46:23;"You freestyle, though?"
01:46:23;01:46:25;"Yeah, I guess that's noodling."
01:46:25;01:46:26;"That's noodling a rap."
01:46:26;01:46:27;"That's the miracle of noodling."
01:46:27;01:46:28;"I don't do it too often."
01:46:28;01:46:32;"That's more like, you know, when you're a kid, you noodle with the freestyling."
01:46:32;01:46:33;"Okay, nice."
01:46:33;01:46:34;"True."
01:46:34;01:46:37;"So maybe it moves in the opposite direction when you're rapping."
01:46:37;01:46:41;"Well, thanks for coming out all the way from New York to these Ohi shows."
01:46:41;01:46:42;"Thanks for having me."
01:46:42;01:46:43;"It's been a real star-studded event."
01:46:43;01:46:46;"We had Despot and Makonnen,"
01:46:46;01:46:53;"and we performed ""Down for So Long"" remix for the second time ever."
01:46:53;01:46:54;"Yeah."
01:46:54;01:46:57;"The first time-- where was that? At Hardfest."
01:46:57;01:46:58;"Hardfest."
01:46:58;01:46:59;"What?"
01:46:59;01:47:00;"That was awkward."
01:47:00;01:47:01;"Whose set was that?"
01:47:01;01:47:02;"Makonnen's set."
01:47:02;01:47:03;"Makonnen had a set at Hardfest."
01:47:03;01:47:04;"Oh, whoa."
01:47:04;01:47:05;"And you brought us out."
01:47:05;01:47:06;"That didn't cross my radar. I didn't know that."
01:47:06;01:47:10;"I remember after that being like, ""Wow, nobody took a video of this."""
01:47:10;01:47:12;"It got no love."
01:47:12;01:47:13;"I forget--"
01:47:13;01:47:14;"It's probably for the best."
01:47:14;01:47:18;"At the moment, it was like Makonnen was super riding high off Tuesday,"
01:47:18;01:47:22;"and I think he brings us out for like a kind of EDM crowd."
01:47:22;01:47:24;"They loved it."
01:47:24;01:47:25;"And then they loved it."
01:47:25;01:47:27;"They loved it. They went crazy."
01:47:27;01:47:28;"They just absolutely loved it."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"Yeah."
01:47:29;01:47:31;"This is both your guys' first time in Ohi?"
01:47:31;01:47:32;"Yeah."
01:47:32;01:47:34;"We've been really blessed with some Misty Mountain weather."
01:47:34;01:47:36;"It's nice out."
01:47:36;01:47:38;"I like Ohi."
01:47:38;01:47:39;"I like that bike trail."
01:47:39;01:47:41;"Oh, yeah. It goes right behind the venue."
01:47:41;01:47:42;"It runs right behind the bowl."
01:47:42;01:47:44;"Yeah, I went running, and I kind of ran out of time."
01:47:44;01:47:45;"I want to go further on it tomorrow."
01:47:45;01:47:47;"You can run all the way to the beach on that."
01:47:47;01:47:48;"Really?"
01:47:48;01:47:49;"That might take a whole day."
01:47:49;01:47:52;"It's like 15 miles to Ventura, I think."
01:47:52;01:47:54;"All right. Good to know."
01:47:54;01:47:55;"It's a goal."
01:52:52;01:52:57;"Okay, well, thanks for listening to this week's Time Crisis."
01:52:57;01:53:00;"We went all the way from L.A. to Ojai."
01:53:00;01:53:05;"We discussed Punisher burgers, IHOP."
01:53:05;01:53:07;"Where'd you come down on IHOP?"
01:53:07;01:53:10;"I more or less thought it was dumb,"
01:53:10;01:53:15;"and I particularly was annoyed that the New York Times, fake news,"
01:53:15;01:53:17;"immediately wrote an article saying,"
01:53:17;01:53:21;"calling that campaign a 21st century marketing success story."
01:53:21;01:53:23;"And I was like, ""Hold your damn horses."""
01:53:23;01:53:24;"Yeah, give it some time."
01:53:24;01:53:25;"Yeah, seriously."
01:53:25;01:53:28;"They wrote this kind of glowing piece about how smart the campaign was,"
01:53:28;01:53:30;"and I was just like, ""Is it?"""
01:53:30;01:53:36;"I went alone for sushi for lunch on Tuesday,"
01:53:36;01:53:38;"and I didn't have any headphones,"
01:53:38;01:53:40;"and I was asking for the check."
01:53:40;01:53:41;"I just wanted to get out."
01:53:41;01:53:46;"You eat sushi with headphones on when you eat alone?"
01:53:46;01:53:47;"Yeah, of course."
01:53:47;01:53:49;"Do people do that? Is that normal?"
01:53:49;01:53:50;"Yeah, of course."
01:53:50;01:53:51;"That's the classic problem."
01:53:51;01:53:52;"I couldn't do that."
01:53:52;01:53:55;"Is that sushi specific, or is that any food?"
01:53:55;01:53:57;"I just don't think we're any--"
01:53:57;01:53:59;"I eat by myself a lot, but I don't--"
01:53:59;01:54:00;"Not with headphones on?"
01:54:00;01:54:02;"No, I just look out the window."
01:54:02;01:54:03;"All right, well, that's not the point."
01:54:03;01:54:08;"But so my point is that I was trapped in the restaurant,"
01:54:08;01:54:14;"and the guy next to me with his friends was reading all these terrible IHOP tweets,"
01:54:14;01:54:16;"and I had to hear so many of them."
01:54:16;01:54:18;"Terrible, like dumb jokes?"
01:54:18;01:54:21;"Yeah, people trying to get in on the meme and trying--"
01:54:21;01:54:22;"Do you remember any?"
01:54:22;01:54:24;"He was reading like 15 terrible tweets."
01:54:24;01:54:26;"Was this guy into it, or was he mad--"
01:54:26;01:54:27;"He loved it. No, no, he loved it."
01:54:27;01:54:30;"And I was just trying to get out of there. It was rough."
01:54:30;01:54:34;"So I think the New York Times is equating attention to success,"
01:54:34;01:54:36;"which is not necessarily true."
01:54:36;01:54:38;"Yeah, I mean, let's wait and see."
01:54:38;01:54:40;"You don't remember any of the tweets?"
01:54:40;01:54:41;"No."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"I was hoping that maybe one."
01:54:43;01:54:45;"I was trying to get out of there."
01:54:45;01:54:46;"They all [bleep] sucked."
01:54:46;01:54:50;"Also, the one thing that I don't like about it is that"
01:54:50;01:54:53;"if IHOP had actually changed their name to IHOP,"
01:54:53;01:54:59;"if they'd done it, that would have been so crazy, so bold, so beautiful."
01:54:59;01:55:03;"See, I passed on IHOP recently, and I was really hoping I'd see a crane"
01:55:03;01:55:05;"detaching the P."
01:55:05;01:55:07;"They did it to literally one in Hollywood."
01:55:07;01:55:10;"They could just add the extra little--"
01:55:10;01:55:14;"But I'm just saying, I think that's very symptomatic of our culture right now,"
01:55:14;01:55:19;"is that it's better to appear brave than to actually be brave."
01:55:19;01:55:21;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:55:21;01:55:22;"Well said."
01:55:22;01:55:23;"Thank you."
01:55:23;01:55:26;"And on that note, goodbye from Ojai."
01:55:26;01:55:31;"This was a multiple county time crisis."
01:55:31;01:55:33;"We'll see you in two weeks."
01:55:33;01:55:34;"Peace."
01:55:34;01:55:37;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:55:37;01:55:40;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beace."
01:55:40;01:55:42;"One."
