00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis"
00:02;00:06;"Number 200"
00:06;00:11;"After 398 hours of content"
00:11;00:16;"We're finally ready to take it all the way to 400"
00:16;00:19;"We'll take a walk down memory lane"
00:19;00:21;"And talk to some TC legends"
00:21;00:25;"All this, plus new music"
00:25;00:27;"From Oliver Anthony Music"
00:27;00:30;"This is Time Crisis"
00:30;00:32;"With Ezra Koenig"
00:37;00:39;"They passed me by"
00:39;00:42;"All of those great romances"
00:42;00:46;"You were a pelt from beneath"
00:46;00:49;"All my rightful chances"
00:49;00:52;"My picture clear"
00:52;00:57;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:57;01:00;"And so I dealt you the blow"
01:00;01:03;"When a bus had to go"
01:04;01:08;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:08;01:11;"One of us is crying"
01:11;01:14;"One of us is lying"
01:14;01:18;"He's a lonely man"
01:18;01:23;"Time Crisis, back again, episode 200"
01:23;01:26;"Alright lads, we did it"
01:26;01:30;"Can you believe that? 200 episodes, 400 hours of content"
01:30;01:32;"I can believe it"
01:32;01:34;"We've been doing this 8 years"
01:34;01:36;"8 years?"
01:36;01:38;"Well, yeah, 8 years"
01:38;01:39;"Good God"
01:39;01:40;"That's insane"
01:40;01:42;"Started in 2015, it's 2023"
01:42;01:46;"I mean, compared to a lot of shows, 200 episodes, that's nothing"
01:46;01:47;"That's true"
01:47;01:49;"But we're slow and steady"
01:49;01:51;"We gotta grind even harder"
01:51;01:54;"We've been grinding pretty hard the past 8 years"
01:54;01:56;"Coming up with 400 hours of content, but"
01:56;01:59;"What I'm hearing is that we need to grind even harder"
01:59;02:00;"Buckle down"
02:00;02:03;"Yeah, I guess it does feel like, when you put it that way, 8 years"
02:03;02:05;"I know, it's really messed up"
02:05;02:08;"That it's been 8 years"
02:08;02:09;"Crazy"
02:09;02:11;"One, that time would go by that fast"
02:11;02:12;"Yeah"
02:12;02:15;"And that two, we would still be doing this, like, dumb show"
02:15;02:16;"Yeah"
02:16;02:18;"The good part about it is"
02:18;02:20;"That the reason it doesn't feel like 8 years"
02:20;02:24;"Is because we do it at a leisurely pace"
02:24;02:26;"And the truth is"
02:26;02:28;"Whether mics or not"
02:28;02:30;"Apple music or not"
02:30;02:32;"This show is happening"
02:32;02:33;"This is just our life"
02:33;02:34;"It's true"
02:34;02:35;"We live this sh*t"
02:35;02:39;"We're not like some of these internet radio shows"
02:39;02:41;"And/or podcasts"
02:41;02:44;"People are just, you know, tilling the earth"
02:44;02:46;"Trying to create content"
02:46;02:48;"We would be having these exact same conversations"
02:48;02:50;"No matter what"
02:50;02:52;"We're gonna take some walks down memory lane"
02:52;02:55;"As I think we need to on episode 200"
02:55;02:56;"We've got some special guests"
02:56;02:59;"And we'll be looking over a bit of TC history"
02:59;03:01;"But before we get into that"
03:01;03:03;"I wrote myself a note on my phone"
03:03;03:05;"I wrote this a week ago"
03:05;03:07;"I wrote, ""Next TC"
03:07;03:10;"Duncan Pumpkin Spice Signature"""
03:10;03:14;"So I must have seen something that I thought would be good for Time Crisis"
03:14;03:17;"Can you guys get something up about that?"
03:17;03:19;"Okay, so I see there's a Duncan ad that says"
03:19;03:21;"""All in on pumpkin"""
03:21;03:23;"""A fresh way to pumpkin at Duncan"""
03:23;03:27;"""New pumpkin cream cold brew, pumpkin spice signature latte"""
03:27;03:30;"""And more fall into Duncan restaurants earlier than ever before"""
03:30;03:33;"And there's a press release on the Duncan website"
03:33;03:37;"It's dated August 11th, 2021"
03:37;03:39;"Okay, so we're really late on this"
03:39;03:42;"Maybe this is something that they do every summer now"
03:42;03:47;"""It may still be warm outside, but Duncan is turning up the pumpkin heat"""
03:47;03:50;"""Earlier than ever before with an incredible fall menu"""
03:50;03:54;"So I guess Duncan's been kind of playing catch up with Starbucks for a while"
03:54;03:57;"The thing that's been cracking me up about it is"
03:57;03:59;"There's something about"
03:59;04:02;"And of course, I love Duncan, I ride for Duncan"
04:02;04:05;"But obviously, when people think of a pumpkin spice latte"
04:05;04:07;"They think of Starbucks"
04:07;04:12;"Starbucks is why the PSL is a part of the public consciousness"
04:12;04:16;"And there's something that I kind of love about"
04:16;04:19;"Duncan having to name their pumpkin spice latte"
04:19;04:21;"And you can totally imagine somebody's like"
04:21;04:26;"""Well, we don't want to seem like we're just kind of playing catch up with Starbucks"""
04:26;04:30;"And somebody says like ""Let's make it seem like almost like we own this"""
04:30;04:33;"Someone's like ""Pumpkin spice signature latte"""
04:33;04:39;"It's like backwards engineering, as if this is Duncan's signature drink"
04:39;04:42;"They're working so hard to try to seem like"
04:42;04:45;"""Yeah, we've always been doing this, it's our signature latte"""
04:45;04:49;"What does that even mean? ""Pumpkin spice signature"""
04:49;04:52;"It's a little bit sad, but it's also kind of funny"
04:52;04:56;"If I wanted a pumpkin spice latte, I would go to Duncan over Starbucks"
04:56;04:57;"Oh, absolutely"
04:57;05:01;"I mean, the problem is that they're rolling this out way too early"
05:01;05:05;"It's late August, it's 98 degrees outside"
05:05;05:07;"In some parts of the country"
05:07;05:10;"I guess you could get... Can you get that as an iced pumpkin?"
05:10;05:12;"That sounds nasty"
05:12;05:14;"Oh yeah, there's plenty of iced pumpkins"
05:14;05:16;"Yeah, any of that sort of iced frap"
05:16;05:17;"And Starbucks is..."
05:17;05:22;"Corn syrup, coffee drinks, that's not my jam"
05:22;05:24;"I'm picturing it's like a cold November day"
05:24;05:28;"The leaves are down, it's 42 degrees"
05:28;05:29;"It's windy"
05:29;05:33;"Yeah, of course, that's when it's going to really be hitting"
05:33;05:36;"I saw the Halloween superstore the other day"
05:36;05:37;"Yeah"
05:37;05:38;"That's up and running"
05:38;05:43;"Oh yeah, and every year you see more and more of people getting mad about"
05:43;05:45;"Oh, there's a Christmas display in August already"
05:45;05:47;"Yeah, I get mad at it"
05:47;05:48;"So I'm looking at the..."
05:48;05:50;"I'm going straight Andy Rooney over here"
05:50;05:52;"You gotta let it go"
05:52;05:54;"I'm looking at the 2023"
05:54;05:55;"Let it go"
05:55;05:58;"Yeah, so what's different in 2023 than 2021?"
05:58;05:59;"Nothing"
05:59;06:03;"I would love to be the Dunkin' Donuts publicist who every year has to like"
06:03;06:10;"Really try and razzle dazzle them with my mid-August fall menu press release"
06:10;06:14;"Well the press release now is just more I think about their overall menu"
06:14;06:19;"So, it is cool that it's Boston, August 16th, 2023"
06:19;06:21;"Dateline"
06:21;06:22;"Dateline Boston"
06:22;06:23;"The wait is over"
06:23;06:25;"I mean to your point, the wait is over"
06:25;06:27;"I mean who's waiting through the summer?"
06:27;06:28;"The wait is over"
06:28;06:30;"So when does pumpkin season end?"
06:30;06:34;"The wait is over at the moment pumpkin spice enthusiasts have eagerly awaited"
06:34;06:36;"That they've eagerly awaited has arrived"
06:36;06:40;"Dunkin's pumpkin lineup is back"
06:40;06:47;"It's been 258 long days since pumpkin fans savored their last sweet taste of pumpkin Dunkin'"
06:47;06:50;"258 days, so let's do a little backward math on that"
06:50;06:52;"That's longer than I would have guessed"
06:52;07:00;"Yeah, I would have guessed they would have rolled that out till they switched over to St. Paddy's drinks in mid-March"
07:00;07:02;"Or maybe like a Valentine's Day thing"
07:02;07:05;"Some sort of like nasty like"
07:05;07:09;"Is that like the shamrock shake? Is there anything else?"
07:09;07:10;"Some minty"
07:10;07:15;"Yeah, 258 days ago was like December"
07:15;07:16;"What?"
07:16;07:18;"Okay, short-lived"
07:18;07:22;"Today guests can indulge in, so this is interesting wording or verbiage"
07:22;07:26;"The reintroduction of the pumpkin spice signature latte"
07:26;07:29;"Yeah, well it reintroduces itself every year"
07:29;07:33;"I feel like they should have called it like Dunk Pump or something"
07:33;07:35;"Really go for it"
07:35;07:37;"Dumpkin"
07:37;07:38;"Pumpkin?"
07:38;07:40;"Pump the pumpkin"
07:40;07:41;"The pumpkin dumper"
07:41;07:43;"Dunk the pump"
07:43;07:45;"Pump the dunk"
07:45;07:47;"Are you seeing that the goldfish"
07:47;07:48;"Yeah, pump and dump"
07:48;07:50;"Pump and dunk"
07:50;07:53;"The goldfish dunkin' pumpkin spice grams are back"
07:53;07:54;"What?"
07:54;07:57;"Two iconic brands are reuniting to bring it back, it's limited edition"
07:57;08:02;"It has flavor notes of pumpkin, donut glaze and warm spices"
08:02;08:04;"Cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg"
08:04;08:07;"And they're available online"
08:07;08:09;"Online only?"
08:09;08:11;"Oh no, in stores nationwide as well"
08:11;08:13;"Oh, wherever goldfish is sold"
08:13;08:14;"This is confusing"
08:14;08:17;"It seems like the only place it's not available is Dunkin'"
08:17;08:19;"I miss those"
08:19;08:20;"I haven't seen them"
08:20;08:24;"Heard the knock on the door"
08:24;08:29;"Couldn't catch my breath"
08:29;08:38;"Is it too late to call this off?"
08:38;08:44;"We could slip away"
08:44;08:47;"Or would that be better?"
08:47;08:52;"Me with nothing to say"
08:52;08:56;"And you in your autumn sweater"
08:56;09:00;"I mean also Starbucks announced that it's pumpkin season"
09:00;09:03;"It's just hilarious, Dunkin' has to pretend Starbucks doesn't exist"
09:03;09:08;"Like, America's been waiting for our pumpkin spice latte to come back"
09:08;09:11;"Does everybody have a pumpkin spice latte?"
09:11;09:12;"Like Wendy's?"
09:12;09:14;"Does Tim Hortons have a pumpkin spice latte?"
09:14;09:15;"Oh for sure"
09:15;09:16;"What do they call it?"
09:16;09:17;"Uh, they must"
09:17;09:21;"The Tim Hortons original, original signature"
09:21;09:24;"First result, pumpkin, pumpkin spice is back"
09:24;09:25;"At Tim Hortons?"
09:25;09:26;"At Tim Hortons"
09:26;09:27;"It's back for everybody"
09:27;09:31;"What about like McDonald's and Burger King, places like that, do they have a pumpkin spice latte?"
09:31;09:34;"Oh they got the pumpkin iced cappuccino, Tim Hortons"
09:34;09:37;"So they've merged their, one of their most famous products"
09:37;09:38;"Does who have it?"
09:38;09:39;"McDonald's"
09:39;09:42;"I don't think McDonald's does it"
09:42;09:44;"Just want to fact check on that"
09:44;09:48;"Burger King's pumpkin spice Oreo shake"
09:48;09:49;"Crazy"
09:49;09:50;"That's them jumping into the pumpkin"
09:50;09:52;"I bet that's pretty good"
09:52;09:54;"Everybody's got pumpkin fever"
09:54;09:56;"It is pretty dark to think that"
09:56;09:58;"Pumpkin season moves earlier and earlier"
09:58;10:00;"And everybody thinks like alright well it's cool"
10:00;10:05;"I'll just get an iced pumpkin beverage at any one of these cafes"
10:05;10:08;"But there's just something about like late August"
10:08;10:11;"Drinking an iced version of this flavor"
10:11;10:16;"That's supposed to be associated with a certain region and a certain temperature"
10:16;10:17;"You know what I mean?"
10:17;10:20;"It's kind of like, I'm sure we've talked about this before"
10:20;10:24;"There's a meme that, you know, it's been popping up for years"
10:24;10:26;"That's about Waluigi"
10:26;10:28;"You know about this right?"
10:28;10:33;"And just to summarize I think the basic idea is that"
10:33;10:37;"Luigi was created just to be a companion to Mario"
10:37;10:42;"You know, Luigi's just this kind of whatever version of Mario"
10:42;10:47;"So he's already the kind of less important brother of the Mario brothers"
10:47;10:52;"And then Waluigi is this like bizarro version of Luigi"
10:52;10:55;"So people always found it interesting philosophically that"
10:55;10:57;"Luigi's already a nothing man"
10:57;11:01;"And then Waluigi is like the bizarro version of a nothing man"
11:01;11:02;"He's like a double nothing man"
11:02;11:04;"He's an empty man"
11:04;11:05;"He's an empty man"
11:05;11:07;"And there is something about that, you know"
11:07;11:10;"It makes sense, it's like some Matrix, you know"
11:10;11:13;"Baudrillard kind of simulacrum, you know"
11:13;11:15;"We're in the desert of the real"
11:15;11:19;"Just layers on layers of simulacra"
11:19;11:22;"And there's definitely a touch of that when you think about"
11:22;11:27;"Trying to reduce this beautiful season fall"
11:27;11:32;"Into a slightly gross chemical flavor"
11:32;11:35;"Already we're in the desert of the real"
11:35;11:38;"You're getting so far from nature"
11:38;11:40;"But at least we get that"
11:40;11:45;"Alright, grandma and grandpa, they had to make their pumpkin spice lattes the old fashioned way"
11:45;11:47;"Had to carve out that pumpkin"
11:47;11:48;"Yeah"
11:48;11:49;"Bake it"
11:49;11:51;"Grandma lived in western Massachusetts"
11:51;11:52;"She'd bake the pumpkin"
11:52;11:55;"Milk the cows"
11:55;12:01;"Grandpa would have to go, you know, get a sack of coffee from the, you know, provision store"
12:01;12:02;"And then make it that way"
12:02;12:04;"Alright, we get it"
12:04;12:06;"You know, it's not the 19th century anymore"
12:06;12:09;"Now, you're a young urban professional living in Boston"
12:09;12:12;"You're gonna go to Dunkin'"
12:12;12:14;"Maybe Starbucks if you're really fancy"
12:14;12:19;"You're gonna get this kind of chemical fake version of the flavor of fall"
12:19;12:22;"But at least you're still in the same weather"
12:22;12:24;"You're still in the same part of the world"
12:24;12:28;"And it might be a fake version but the feeling is real"
12:28;12:30;"But already you're in Luigi territory"
12:30;12:32;"Once you're drinking a pumpkin spice latte"
12:32;12:35;"Once you're drinking an iced pumpkin spice latte"
12:35;12:39;"In the American Southwest in August"
12:39;12:41;"You've entered Waluigi territory"
12:41;12:45;"Just layers upon layers of simulation"
12:45;12:49;"The real has been utterly defeated"
12:49;12:51;"Adam Curtis is gonna sink his teeth into this"
12:51;12:52;"Oh, he's gonna love it"
12:52;12:54;"McDonald's is in the game though"
12:54;12:57;"You can get a pumpkin spice latte at McDonald's"
12:57;12:58;"Okay"
12:58;12:59;"Pumpkin flavored coffee"
12:59;13:01;"Can you get an iced pumpkin?"
13:01;13:03;"My suspicions were right then"
13:03;13:05;"But not at Burger King, it's not available yet"
13:05;13:07;"I'm an American man"
13:07;13:09;"It's a big revenue driver"
13:09;13:13;"I mean, it looks like 11% or something of like Starbucks sales increase"
13:13;13:14;"Crazy"
13:14;13:15;"You know"
13:15;13:17;"I mean, right now there's somebody"
13:17;13:19;"What's the temperature in Scottsdale right now?"
13:19;13:20;"Can I get a number crunch?"
13:20;13:22;"I'm gonna guess 110"
13:22;13:24;"That's like a classic Scottsdale temp"
13:24;13:25;"It's 110"
13:25;13:26;"Really? Well done"
13:26;13:27;"It's 110"
13:27;13:30;"There's a man in a drive-thru"
13:30;13:34;"In his air-conditioned Chrysler Pacifica"
13:34;13:35;"Yep"
13:35;13:38;"There's 14 cars in front of him in the drive-thru"
13:38;13:39;"Yep"
13:39;13:42;"It's gonna take about 25 minutes"
13:42;13:44;"To get this drink"
13:44;13:45;"And he's thinking about it"
13:45;13:51;"He's like, ""God, I hope they have that iced pumpkin spice latte available"""
13:51;13:54;"Pulls over to drink that iced pumpkin spice latte"
13:54;13:56;"110 degrees"
13:56;13:58;"Pumpkin spice latte is not supposed to be cold"
13:58;14:00;"I understand that they do it"
14:00;14:01;"But the idea is supposed to"
14:01;14:02;"Well, they have to do it"
14:02;14:03;"They have to do it because it's too hot"
14:03;14:04;"Of course"
14:04;14:07;"And as they want to colonize the summer"
14:07;14:13;"Then you get into this absurd Waluigi territory of drinking an iced pumpkin spice latte"
14:13;14:15;"You're just a dude"
14:15;14:17;"Would you say he was in a Pacifica?"
14:17;14:18;"Chrysler Pacifica"
14:18;14:19;"You're in a Chrysler Pacifica"
14:19;14:21;"It's 110 degrees outside"
14:21;14:24;"You're drinking it on your way to work"
14:24;14:27;"Maybe born and raised in Arizona"
14:27;14:29;"Dad moved there from work"
14:29;14:31;"Grandparents are from Boston"
14:31;14:34;"Great-grandparents are from Ireland"
14:34;14:36;"And here you are"
14:36;14:38;"We did it"
14:38;14:43;"Once divided"
14:43;14:48;"Nothing left to subtract"
14:48;14:53;"Some words when spoken"
14:53;14:58;"Can't be taken back"
14:58;15:03;"Walks on his own"
15:03;15:08;"With thoughts he can't help thinking"
15:08;15:13;"Futures above"
15:13;15:18;"But in the past he's slow and sick"
15:18;15:25;"Caught a bolt of lightning"
15:25;15:32;"Cursed the day he let it go"
15:33;15:40;"Nothing left"
15:40;15:45;"Nothing left"
15:45;15:49;"Isn't it something?"
15:49;15:53;"Nothing left"
15:53;15:55;"Speaking of Starbucks"
15:55;15:57;"We should probably give Winter a call"
15:57;16:01;"We have to do Winter and Death Spot"
16:01;16:02;"Alright, let's move on"
16:02;16:06;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
16:06;16:10;"Winter?"
16:10;16:12;"How are you guys doing?"
16:12;16:14;"We're good, we've been enjoying"
16:14;16:18;"We've just been discussing that pumpkin spice latte season is back again"
16:18;16:22;"And it seems like it crept up"
16:22;16:23;"And they pushed it earlier"
16:23;16:25;"I haven't actually looked at a calendar"
16:25;16:29;"But I've heard at least two people complain about how it seems to be creeping up"
16:29;16:31;"And marking the start of Fall"
16:31;16:34;"Even though I still think it's Summer"
16:34;16:37;"How often are you drinking a pumpkin spice latte?"
16:37;16:40;"I don't think I have ever had a pumpkin spice latte"
16:40;16:43;"Simply because I don't like pumpkin"
16:43;16:45;"I do have the occasional latte"
16:45;16:48;"Usually it'd be a special occasion"
16:48;16:52;"Maybe at a roastery or at some other coffee house"
16:52;16:54;"So, I guess it's funny"
16:54;16:57;"I've never asked you this question before"
16:57;16:59;"You're the ultimate king of Starbucking"
16:59;17:03;"You've been to more Starbucks than anybody on Earth"
17:03;17:07;"And yet, it's never been a goal of yours to explore the entire Starbucks menu"
17:07;17:10;"That's correct"
17:10;17:12;"The truth is"
17:12;17:15;"I really, really like filter coffee"
17:15;17:19;"And ever since I started trying out the independent cafes"
17:19;17:22;"I really, really like light roasted filter coffee"
17:22;17:26;"And that's just something that Starbucks is not going to offer"
17:26;17:31;"So, for me, they're about the design of the cafes"
17:31;17:34;"An interest in their business practices"
17:34;17:38;"And of course all the challenges and traveling that go with Starbucking"
17:38;17:41;"And speaking of traveling, we heard you're in the UK right now?"
17:41;17:43;"I am"
17:43;17:48;"I am at a hostel in central Birmingham, England"
17:48;17:51;"This is actually a pretty cool experience"
17:51;17:54;"My last few times through Birmingham have been by car"
17:54;18:00;"So, there's actually something to be said for just walking around"
18:00;18:03;"So, as soon as I checked in, I walked around"
18:03;18:06;"Found a nice little Indian restaurant"
18:06;18:08;"It's much less stressful"
18:08;18:14;"The driving in the past five days has been really, really stressful"
18:14;18:20;"I think that the roads have gotten narrower, if you can believe that"
18:20;18:22;"Or maybe I'm just getting old"
18:22;18:26;"There are definitely more speed cameras everywhere"
18:26;18:29;"So, this is an experience"
18:29;18:32;"And the thing about being in a rental car is"
18:32;18:35;"Those tickets don't go to you"
18:35;18:37;"They'll go to the agency"
18:37;18:40;"And I believe that they all tack on an administration fee to pay them"
18:40;18:42;"You can't speed in the UK"
18:42;18:44;"They'll get you, they got cameras everywhere"
18:44;18:48;"Mostly, I'm just feeling this glow of"
18:48;18:52;"Finally, after seven years"
18:52;18:55;"Returning overseas, returning to the UK"
18:55;18:57;"I truly love this country"
18:57;19:03;"In fact, the UK is the only place that gets an entire chapter in my book"
19:03;19:08;"This is my 11th or 12th time here"
19:08;19:11;"Part of that is obviously"
19:11;19:14;"Starbucks just has a lot of growth here"
19:14;19:17;"And for the past decade, of course"
19:17;19:19;"I've played a lot of Scrabble here, too"
19:19;19:23;"Since, you know, English, same language"
19:23;19:25;"There's a pretty active Scrabble scene"
19:25;19:28;"And is that why you're in Birmingham specifically?"
19:28;19:32;"No, no, the tournament was down in Milton Keynes"
19:32;19:35;"It was the British Match-Based Scrabble Championship"
19:35;19:37;"How did you do?"
19:37;19:41;"I came in ninth, which was much better than I expected"
19:41;19:45;"Given that my focus since the pandemic began has not been Scrabble"
19:45;19:51;"We've chatted before, I think I've mentioned that I shifted my focus over to fitness"
19:51;19:53;"To writing my book"
19:53;19:57;"And then, over the past, more recently"
19:57;20:00;"Just trying to catch up on all these Starbucks"
20:00;20:03;"You know, trying to put all my energy into this big global trip"
20:03;20:06;"So I've barely practiced, barely studied"
20:06;20:08;"But you're still top ten"
20:08;20:11;"I have some latent skills, so that feels kind of good"
20:11;20:16;"It's fair to say you're like the ninth best Scrabble player in the UK?"
20:16;20:18;"Not even close, no"
20:18;20:20;"I finished ninth in this competition"
20:20;20:23;"Even if I had won the competition"
20:23;20:27;"I would not have called myself the best player in the UK"
20:27;20:30;"Because, you know, like poker, there's that luck element"
20:30;20:32;"Titles will come out of the bag"
20:32;20:38;"I mean, at the World Championships in Las Vegas last month"
20:38;20:42;"The player who went on to win, he played in a warm-up event"
20:42;20:45;"Four games, and lost them all"
20:45;20:48;"So anything can happen in Scrabble"
20:48;20:52;"You just have to be good enough to take advantage of the opportunities presented to you"
20:52;20:54;"Are you ranked globally?"
20:54;20:56;"Yes, and I don't know what my ranking is"
20:56;20:58;"Are you like top thousand?"
20:58;21:00;"Oh, yeah, of course, yeah, no"
21:00;21:03;"I might be top hundred, not sure"
21:03;21:07;"How big was the competition? You finished ninth, how many people were in it?"
21:07;21:10;"In the top group, I think we had about 50"
21:10;21:14;"And maybe another 50 in group B"
21:14;21:16;"So maybe about 100"
21:16;21:21;"It's smaller than the World Championship in Las Vegas"
21:21;21:25;"Which had several hundred players across two divisions"
21:25;21:26;"Were you in that one?"
21:26;21:28;"Yes, I was in that one"
21:28;21:30;"I didn't do well in that one"
21:30;21:32;"Or the North American Championship"
21:32;21:34;"Or the alternate North American Championship"
21:34;21:37;"It was a pretty bad summer for Scrabble"
21:37;21:42;"So I'm glad that I finished my run with a top ten finish"
21:42;21:43;"Congratulations"
21:43;21:44;"Thank you, thank you"
21:44;21:47;"Because you're in England, you have to do English spellings?"
21:47;21:52;"Yes, that is one of the challenges with me in particular"
21:52;21:57;"In North America, most players play using the North American lexicon"
21:57;22:01;"Used only by the US, Canada, Israel"
22:01;22:03;"Maybe a couple of other countries"
22:03;22:06;"But the rest of the world uses the British lexicon"
22:06;22:09;"And I have to switch back and forth"
22:09;22:13;"So that's kind of like playing with one arm tied behind my back"
22:13;22:16;"But I think it's a good mental exercise"
22:16;22:17;"Well done"
22:17;22:41;"[Scat singing]"
22:41;22:45;"Meet me at the coffee shop"
22:45;22:49;"We can dance like it is wild"
22:49;22:53;"Another go in the parking lot"
22:53;22:56;"A sweet cheek on your hot spot"
22:56;22:58;"So how's the Starbucks been doing?"
22:58;23:01;"How many Starbucks are there in Birmingham?"
23:01;23:03;"In the greater Birmingham area"
23:03;23:09;"There are about nine or ten new ones"
23:09;23:14;"And existing company-owned stores were maybe half that"
23:14;23:17;"So not more than a couple of dozen"
23:17;23:20;"They actually call them equity stores over here"
23:20;23:22;"Which I just learned for this trip"
23:22;23:26;"I'm not counting, of course, as we discussed before, the licensed stores"
23:26;23:31;"Or something that they have in the UK and France but nowhere else"
23:31;23:33;"They actually have franchise stores here"
23:33;23:36;"But it's not individual franchising"
23:36;23:40;"So you as Rekainic could probably not get a franchise"
23:40;23:43;"Starbucks would want you to create your own company"
23:43;23:46;"And demonstrate that you have the ability to open up multiple stores"
23:46;23:50;"They're not interested in, you know, grandma and grandpa"
23:50;23:52;"Taking their life savings to open up a Starbucks"
23:52;23:56;"All right, so maybe I'll put together a consortium of UK businessmen"
23:56;23:59;"What's the minimum number of stores that you need to open?"
23:59;24:01;"Minimum buy-in?"
24:01;24:07;"I don't, but I have read an article that they are looking for franchise companies"
24:07;24:10;"That are willing to run multi-units"
24:10;24:13;"However, they have gotten away from that"
24:13;24:16;"When they started that in 2013-2014"
24:16;24:21;"The number of company-owned stores dropped dramatically"
24:21;24:24;"So I last came here in '15 and '16"
24:24;24:27;"And I was easily able to see all the new stores"
24:27;24:30;"Just because they were focusing on the franchising"
24:30;24:33;"Well, apparently, I'm told that they're concerned"
24:33;24:37;"About the quality and the dilution of the brand"
24:37;24:40;"And they have started reasserting themselves"
24:40;24:42;"So now in the last seven years"
24:42;24:47;"I have about 120-130 equity stores that have opened"
24:47;24:50;"And fewer franchise stores have opened"
24:50;24:52;"I always thought franchising was a bad idea"
24:52;24:57;"I think Starbucks really needs to control their image"
24:57;24:59;"I might have mentioned the story before"
24:59;25:03;"About how Walmart approached them a long time ago"
25:03;25:06;"And was turned down"
25:06;25:09;"Because of course, Starbucks doesn't want to dilute their brand"
25:09;25:12;"And that's why they have to be careful with this franchising"
25:12;25:15;"I'm glad that it hasn't expanded outside of the UK and France"
25:15;25:18;"But they have Starbucks in like Target?"
25:18;25:22;"I mean, we can agree that Target is a little more upmarket than Walmart, yes?"
25:22;25:23;"No"
25:23;25:24;"No? Okay"
25:24;25:27;"It's the same garbage, it's just slightly different branding"
25:27;25:31;"Target reads more, even though I understand there's been controversy"
25:31;25:33;"Of Target's politics"
25:33;25:37;"I think it still reads more like Blue State, somehow"
25:37;25:40;"On a personal note, I camp out at Walmart all the time"
25:40;25:42;"So I can't say too much bad about them"
25:42;25:46;"I go in more there in the morning and buy my groceries before moving on"
25:46;25:52;"But I personally feel sad when I'm in Walmart"
25:52;25:55;"And I don't feel sad when I'm in Target"
25:55;25:56;"I don't know why"
25:56;25:57;"I have the opposite feeling"
25:57;26:00;"I feel like Walmart is just a straight shooter"
26:00;26:03;"Target, they've got all this window dressing on there"
26:03;26:08;"Trying to dress it up like it's some sort of fancy-dancy big box store"
26:08;26:13;"It's the same flat screen TVs and underwear coming off the container ship from China"
26:13;26:15;"I think it's the color scheme"
26:15;26:16;"The red and white"
26:16;26:17;"Yes!"
26:17;26:19;"What's your favorite color?"
26:19;26:22;"I love the red and white color scheme"
26:22;26:25;"The Walmart colors suck and they depress me"
26:25;26:27;"The blue is, I mean, it's just sad"
26:27;26:31;"Well, Walmart's spirit, it's like red, white, and gray"
26:31;26:33;"Yeah, the gray is a bummer"
26:33;26:34;"It's like almost"
26:34;26:35;"Is there gray?"
26:35;26:38;"Sorry, I meant red, gray, and blue"
26:38;26:41;"I think they have some orange in their colors"
26:41;26:46;"It's like an article about how do you make your decision which you want to be, you know, loyal to"
26:46;26:50;"And deciding which store to give your loyalty to would depend on what you look for in a shopping experience"
26:50;26:55;"If you're more concerned with the culture of the stores you frequent, then you might prefer Target"
26:55;26:59;"But if you're purely concerned with getting the lowest possible prices on the widest selection of goods"
26:59;27:02;"Then Walmart is admittedly hard to beat"
27:02;27:03;"I think that's right"
27:03;27:09;"I think that there's something about whatever topical, superficial, you know, the color scheme, the branding"
27:09;27:13;"Wait, now, Nick, does Walmart have a price match guarantee?"
27:13;27:14;"No"
27:14;27:17;"They don't need to, those prices are so good"
27:17;27:19;"They're just dropping, they're constantly dropping"
27:19;27:24;"So, even though it depresses you, you hit Walmart because the prices are campy beat?"
27:24;27:25;"No, I don't care about the price"
27:25;27:29;"It's the fact that most of the Walmarts let you camp there"
27:29;27:33;"Although they have gotten away from that at the more urban stores"
27:33;27:38;"And when you say camp, you mean like sleep in the parking lot or tented up inside?"
27:38;27:41;"I think they might frown on a tent"
27:41;27:46;"But no, I mean, you know, if you go to the more rural areas off the beaten path"
27:46;27:54;"You can go into a Walmart and you can see all these campers and camper vans parked towards the back and big RVs"
27:54;27:56;"It's a common thing"
27:56;27:57;"They've had that policy forever"
27:57;28:02;"I mean, I guess they figured people will wake up in the morning and they'll buy what they need from Walmart"
28:02;28:11;"And it's only more recently that more and more stores, especially in the cities, have started prohibiting overnight camping"
28:11;28:17;"In some cases, it's a city ordinance, but in other cases, it's Walmart itself or the property"
28:17;28:23;"I think in part it has to do with the increase in the unhoused population throughout the US"
29:10;29:15;"Winston Winter, when you wake up in a Walmart parking lot and you go inside"
29:15;29:20;"Are you getting a coffee there or you're going to wait to go to Starbucks for your morning coffee?"
29:20;29:24;"I'm going to wait to go to either Starbucks or whatever independent cafe I'm going to"
29:24;29:29;"But no, no, I'll go inside and I'll buy pretty much standard things"
29:29;29:34;"Apple, banana, yogurt, possibly orange juice"
29:34;29:38;"Although most of the Walmarts don't have the juice that I like"
29:38;29:41;"When I run out of oatmeal, I'll buy the oatmeal"
29:41;29:42;"So that's breakfast"
29:42;29:44;"Yeah, yep, it's breakfast"
29:44;29:45;"Clean"
29:45;29:51;"That'll actually, that plus a Soylent or a Huel will tighten me over off until like 2, 3pm"
29:51;29:53;"And then are you beelining it to Starbucks?"
29:53;29:56;"Like, are you a kind of don't talk to me until I've had my coffee thing?"
29:56;29:59;"Are you like a zombie as you trudge through Walmart?"
29:59;30:01;"Actually, yeah, yeah"
30:01;30:03;"You know, I got to get in there"
30:03;30:06;"I got to at least splash some water on my face to try and wake up"
30:06;30:10;"Truth is, often I will have coffee in my car already"
30:10;30:14;"Because remember, I have to drink coffee from each store"
30:14;30:16;"But I don't have to drink it right away"
30:16;30:20;"So what I typically do is, towards the end of the day"
30:20;30:23;"I'll save the samples from 2 or 3 stores"
30:23;30:26;"Ah, so you got a day old coffee ready to go"
30:26;30:28;"This is like Jerry Sautz over here"
30:28;30:32;"Yeah, and then the first thing I do when I wake up is I'll just chug that"
30:32;30:34;"And that'll get me going"
30:34;30:40;"You know, it also helps sleeping if I'm not downing coffee at 6, 7, 8pm at night"
30:40;30:42;"Right, of course, you got to have a cut off"
30:42;30:45;"That raises an interesting question, and I hope you'll be honest"
30:45;30:50;"Have you ever hit a few Starbucks later in the day, grabbed the coffees"
30:50;30:53;"Rule of state, I don't have to drink them now, I'll drink them later"
30:53;30:56;"But then one thing leads to another the next day"
30:56;30:59;"Things get confused, you misplace one"
30:59;31:02;"And then you can't count that box on the list"
31:02;31:04;"Has that ever happened?"
31:04;31:09;"It has happened for a reason that I don't even know that I can say on this show"
31:09;31:12;"That's spicy"
31:12;31:17;"Uh, yeah, let's just say that I have to go back"
31:17;31:19;"If we're putting you at any kind of legal risk"
31:19;31:22;"No, it's not legal, I just don't want to gross out your listeners"
31:22;31:25;"But I did have to go back to that store later"
31:25;31:28;"Because the coffee was no longer drinkable"
31:28;31:33;"Okay, I can kind of imagine what might have happened"
31:33;31:35;"I think we could put two and two together"
31:35;31:37;"Yeah, life on the road, we get it"
31:37;31:39;"Okay, so that's how real you are"
31:39;31:42;"Wait, so Home Depot's cool with camping?"
31:42;31:46;"Yeah, Home Depot, I don't know that they have an explicit policy"
31:46;31:51;"But I have never been woken up in a Home Depot parking lot"
31:51;31:54;"And sometimes I get woken up by security at a Walmart"
31:54;31:57;"And they say, you can go over to the Home Depot, you'll be okay"
31:57;32:00;"I've never had a problem in Home Depot"
32:00;32:03;"How many calories is that Soylent meal?"
32:03;32:09;"The recommended two scoops should be about 400, same for Huwul"
32:09;32:12;"Throw in a banana, that's another 100 calories"
32:12;32:15;"That'll tide you over for quite a bit"
32:15;32:20;"I've actually had Huwul plus a banana"
32:20;32:23;"Pretty much before all of my 5K races"
32:23;32:29;"And I attribute that to some of the times I've been able to post"
32:29;32:31;"Wow, what are your 5K times?"
32:31;32:36;"Most recent one was 1927"
32:36;32:39;"Earlier this year in Houston on a flat course"
32:39;32:41;"That's cruising"
32:41;32:44;"Yeah, but it's going to get harder year after year"
32:44;32:47;"I don't know what you guys' fitness routine is"
32:47;32:51;"But all of us are getting older and every year gets a little harder, doesn't it?"
32:51;32:54;"Yeah, I mean I run, but I'm not doing 6.5 minute miles"
32:54;32:57;"Mile after mile like you are"
32:57;33:01;"Are you in the shape of your life right now, Winter, with your focus on fitness?"
33:01;33:04;"Generally speaking, over the past 3 years during the pandemic"
33:04;33:06;"Yeah, generally"
33:06;33:09;"Right now, I'm getting a little soft"
33:09;33:12;"Because I'm traveling and I'm obviously not running"
33:12;33:14;"I'm not hitting the gym every day"
33:14;33:17;"And pretty much all I'm going to do over the next 6 months"
33:17;33:18;"Is just a lot of walking"
33:18;33:22;"Once I get out of this phase where I'm in the rental car in the UK and Ireland"
33:22;33:25;"Most of the rest of the trip is just going to be a lot of walking"
33:25;33:30;"And that'll be good, but upper body, abs, none of that"
33:30;33:32;"Until next year"
33:32;33:36;"But that's the way my life goes"
33:36;33:39;"At certain times I focus on certain things"
33:39;33:41;"And for the next 6 months"
33:41;33:45;"The focus is on hitting as many of these starbucking milestones as I can"
33:45;33:47;"And trying to drum up some publicity"
33:47;33:50;"Trying to get an article or something to go viral"
33:50;33:52;"Well, I hope that happens for you"
33:52;33:56;"If there's any TC heads out in the UK or Ireland"
33:56;33:58;"Should be very excited to know that"
33:58;34:03;"The originator of starbucking is in your green and pleasant land"
34:03;34:05;"You definitely have fans out here"
34:05;34:08;"I've had several of them reach out to me already"
34:08;34:10;"Offering to buy me coffee"
34:10;34:13;"So, you've got your share of fans all over the world, I suspect"
34:13;34:15;"Oh, that's great, great to hear it"
34:15;34:19;"Well, thanks so much for calling in for our 200th episode, Winter"
34:19;34:22;"Hey, it's been great speaking to you"
34:22;34:24;"We always love checking in with you"
34:24;34:28;"And we're so glad to hear you're back on the road starbucking internationally"
34:28;34:32;"It was great talking to you and finally talking to you from overseas"
34:32;34:36;"So, the timing worked out marvelously"
34:36;34:38;"Yes, awesome"
34:38;34:41;"Alright, well, get some rest and we'll talk to you soon, man"
34:41;34:44;"Alright, take care, look forward to listening to the show, bye-bye"
34:44;34:45;"Bye"
34:45;34:48;"That was Winter's 9th appearance"
34:48;34:51;"Wow, major"
34:51;34:53;"It was on last summer"
34:53;34:56;"Home Depot does not have a policy"
34:56;34:58;"Against sleeping in their parking lot"
34:58;35:00;"Learn something new every day, I'm surprised by that"
35:00;35:05;"Have you guys ever, how many times have you slept in a car in your life?"
35:05;35:08;"Zero, I'm gonna say zero"
35:08;35:10;"I don't know if that's true"
35:10;35:14;"What about you, on tour, did you sleep in a vehicle?"
35:14;35:19;"Well, I've slept in a tour bus, but that doesn't count, that's got a bed in it"
35:19;35:21;"I think I have slept in a..."
35:21;35:24;"In like a passenger seat? I've never done that"
35:24;35:26;"I've done like back of the minivan"
35:26;35:29;"Just like throw the driver's seat back and just crash?"
35:29;35:33;"Nah, I haven't done that, but I've definitely done many, many times"
35:33;35:35;"Sleeping bag in the back of the van"
35:35;35:37;"In the back of the van, for sure"
35:37;35:39;"Falling asleep in a car?"
35:39;35:40;"Like on a road trip?"
35:40;35:42;"Yeah, we've all done that"
35:42;35:44;"Oh, like you're not driving?"
35:44;35:46;"Close your eyes?"
35:46;35:48;"Close my eyes for 30 minutes"
35:48;35:50;"Well, that's never happened to me"
35:50;35:52;"I just find it so..."
35:52;35:53;"I can't sleep in cars either"
35:53;35:55;"No, I find it so exciting"
35:55;35:56;"You just Eddie Drive?"
35:56;35:59;"Even as a small child, you wouldn't catch me with my eyes closed"
35:59;36:00;"Your head's out the window"
36:00;36:02;"I'm just taking it all in, 360"
36:02;36:04;"Just vibing"
36:04;36:06;"Maybe cranking some tunes"
36:06;36:09;"Looking out the window, looking for horses"
36:09;36:11;"Okay, focused on the surroundings"
36:11;36:13;"It's really weird that you would just fall asleep"
36:13;36:14;"It wasn't on purpose"
36:14;36:16;"You fall asleep in movies, too? Plays?"
36:16;36:18;"I have, not a play"
36:18;36:19;"Concert? No"
36:19;36:23;"Guys, I can't believe how good a transition this is"
36:23;36:25;"To calling Despot"
36:25;36:28;"Who does not do anything on an airplane, if you guys recall"
36:28;36:30;"I think about this all the time"
36:30;36:32;"He just stares straight ahead, right?"
36:32;36:34;"He doesn't even stare out the window"
36:34;36:36;"Doesn't he stare at the..."
36:36;36:37;"Back of the seat"
36:37;36:38;"We should call him"
36:38;36:40;"What a transition, David Putty style"
36:40;36:42;"There's a story about Ron DeSantis"
36:42;36:44;"That he was on a flight to..."
36:44;36:46;"Someone was across the aisle from him"
36:46;36:48;"And it was a flight to Israel"
36:48;36:50;"So it was like 12 hours or something"
36:50;36:52;"And apparently he just sat there the entire time"
36:52;36:53;"Despot style"
36:53;36:54;"Wow"
36:54;36:56;"No media"
36:56;36:58;"Just sat there, just thinking"
36:58;37:00;"Just looking at the back of the seat"
37:00;37:02;"I mean, that's a lot of bad things about him"
37:02;37:04;"But that's one plus"
37:04;37:07;"Yeah, I was like, oh my god, this is straight out of Despot's book"
37:07;37:09;"I gotta tell you, the Twitter community"
37:09;37:13;"Has really been captivated by that Despot trait"
37:13;37:15;"And it comes up a lot"
37:15;37:17;"And we should say that"
37:17;37:20;"You put out a little poll, kind of"
37:20;37:23;"Just asking, what are the Time Crisis Community's favorite"
37:23;37:25;"Subjects that we've ever covered"
37:25;37:27;"Because this is our 200th episode"
37:27;37:30;"And Despot's in-flight routine was one of them"
37:30;37:35;"It was first mentioned on episode 50, August 27th, 2017"
37:35;37:38;"So 150 episodes later"
37:38;37:40;"We can ask him about it"
37:40;37:41;"He's got legs"
37:41;37:43;"Alright, let's get Despot on the horn"
37:43;37:46;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks"
37:46;37:49;"Hand over hand over hand over fist"
37:49;37:52;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks"
37:52;37:55;"Huff and puff, you ain't blowing down"
37:55;37:59;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks"
37:59;38:02;"Hand over hand over hand over fist"
38:02;38:05;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks"
38:05;38:08;"Huff and puff, you ain't blowing down"
38:08;38:12;"Running on fumes, walking on coals"
38:12;38:15;"Pockets on road, game pulled out of control"
38:15;38:18;"Green means go, red means go"
38:18;38:21;"I'm colorblind, mother f***er, I don't know"
38:21;38:24;"Beat a beat in the block, I'm pleading and squeezing the juice out"
38:24;38:27;"Deezer screaming, ""Let's stop"" I'm fleaging the scene with the too loud"
38:27;38:30;"Money talk if you showing off, then that money talk too loud"
38:30;38:34;"Slap a gag order on a Vaught and cut Benjamin's tongue out"
38:34;38:37;"Let their presidents run now, won't be no more discussion"
38:37;38:39;"Go so hard in the paint, I'm f***ing and busting"
38:39;38:42;"N***a in the bucket and run amok on you"
38:42;38:45;"Facing bitches and cuss up in public, my come up ain't one to f***"
38:45;38:48;"Not for nothing, you nothing"
38:48;38:50;"Stopping slime, y'all a snot rocket"
38:50;38:53;"Got a lot of products stocked in the dockers, that's hot pockets"
38:53;38:57;"Fresh out the car wash, still got a dirty trunk"
38:57;39:00;"Out for that gold plaque, like some old dirty front"
39:00;39:03;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks"
39:03;39:06;"Hand over hand over hand over fist"
39:06;39:09;"This little piggy got a house made of bricks"
39:09;39:12;"Puff and pump, you ain't blowing down"
39:12;39:13;"Down"
39:14;39:17;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
39:17;39:20;"[Phone ringing]"
39:20;39:21;"Hello?"
39:21;39:24;"[Laughter]"
39:24;39:26;"Jesus, S-Bot, welcome back"
39:26;39:27;"[Laughter]"
39:27;39:29;"I'm driving a car"
39:29;39:31;"I'm on the BQE, you know"
39:31;39:33;"Oh, you're in your car?"
39:33;39:35;"Yeah, man"
39:35;39:36;"[Laughter]"
39:36;39:41;"Oh, you're just walking barefoot on the BQE on FaceTime"
39:41;39:43;"Okay, you're in your car, that's actually perfect"
39:43;39:46;"How many times in your life have you slept in a car?"
39:46;39:50;"Oh, uh, I don't know"
39:50;39:52;"Probably too many to count"
39:52;39:54;"You mean like, go to sleep"
39:54;39:58;"You don't mean like, somebody's driving the car and you fall asleep"
39:58;39:59;"That doesn't count"
39:59;40:03;"No, not just like you closed your eyes during a long drive"
40:03;40:05;"Like, you slept, you spent the night in a car"
40:05;40:09;"Yeah, I used to do that a lot when I was"
40:09;40:13;"You know, if I drank too much, you get in your car"
40:13;40:16;"And you have to make the decision"
40:16;40:21;"Whether you're gonna try to drive home or if it's not a good idea"
40:21;40:24;"If it's not a good idea, you go to sleep"
40:24;40:29;"And then you like, sometimes you wake up and like, the sun is out"
40:29;40:31;"And it's really hot in the car"
40:31;40:35;"And you think you're gonna feel good"
40:35;40:39;"And yeah, I don't know how many times"
40:39;40:42;"If I had to guess, 20-ish?"
40:42;40:44;"Wow"
40:44;40:45;"Yeah"
40:45;40:47;"Almost always because of drinking"
40:47;40:50;"Has it ever been because of like, you're on a road trip"
40:50;40:52;"And you pulled over into like, a Walmart parking lot"
40:52;40:54;"Just to spend the night, save some money"
40:54;40:56;"No, I've never done that"
40:56;40:58;"But that's how people get killed, right?"
40:58;40:59;"Isn't that like"
40:59;41:01;"I don't know, what do you mean?"
41:01;41:04;"I don't know, I feel like you always hear about like"
41:04;41:08;"Some guy pulled over and went to sleep in one of those little rest areas"
41:08;41:11;"And then people just walk up on the car and kill him"
41:11;41:13;"Because why not, I guess"
41:13;41:16;"But when you've slept in your car drunk"
41:16;41:19;"Because you're the person I know who drives around New York City the most"
41:19;41:23;"Which famously, is not a car town"
41:23;41:26;"No, and I'm blind right now"
41:26;41:28;"Right now I'm driving, blind"
41:28;41:30;"What do you mean?"
41:30;41:32;"You know, I just saw you here"
41:32;41:34;"I had that thing in my eyes"
41:34;41:36;"That my vision is f***ed"
41:36;41:38;"But I just drive anyway"
41:38;41:40;"What, like you need to get glasses now?"
41:40;41:42;"Possibly"
41:42;41:44;"I've had this thing since March"
41:44;41:46;"Do you want me to get into it?"
41:46;41:49;"It's not even fun, it's not even interesting really"
41:49;41:52;"Except, I don't know, is it? It's not"
41:52;41:53;"Maybe"
41:53;41:54;"We can move on"
41:54;41:55;"Yeah, we can move on"
41:55;41:56;"Yeah, okay"
41:56;41:59;"But I am interested, what's your visibility level?"
41:59;42:02;"I mean, I don't know right now, I'm driving"
42:02;42:04;"There's a bunch of cars"
42:04;42:06;"You know there are cars"
42:06;42:07;"Can you see colors?"
42:07;42:09;"Or is it kind of just shadows?"
42:09;42:11;"Shadows passing in front of you"
42:11;42:13;"I've been colorblind my whole life"
42:13;42:17;"And when I went to the eye doctor for this thing"
42:17;42:20;"He was like, you know you're severely colorblind"
42:20;42:22;"And I was like, yeah man"
42:22;42:24;"But you don't have to rub it in"
42:24;42:25;"Severely?"
42:25;42:28;"Yeah, because he was a new eye doctor"
42:28;42:30;"He's like the specialist who's supposed to"
42:30;42:32;"This s*** has been going on since March"
42:32;42:36;"So I don't know, the guy obviously didn't fix it"
42:36;42:38;"You're known as a pretty sharp dresser"
42:38;42:40;"Yeah"
42:40;42:43;"You have an amazing collection of vintage polo"
42:43;42:45;"And t-shirts"
42:45;42:47;"I heard that when you're colorblind"
42:47;42:49;"You need a lot of help picking out outfits"
42:49;42:53;"I've heard that too, but I think it's just like intuition"
42:53;42:55;"I'm like, these things must look okay together"
42:55;42:56;"I don't know"
42:56;42:58;"And I guess you probably naturally stay away from"
42:58;43:00;"The confusing zone"
43:00;43:02;"I have a lot of confusing zones"
43:02;43:03;"Like blue and purple"
43:03;43:06;"Sometimes like, you know, browns and reds"
43:06;43:08;"It can happen"
43:08;43:10;"I don't know, like I don't really know"
43:10;43:11;"Oh wait, that reminds me"
43:11;43:13;"There's something we found out hanging out"
43:13;43:15;"In New York recently"
43:15;43:17;"There's a certain word that me and Alex say the same way"
43:17;43:19;"But a lot of people don't say it the same way"
43:19;43:21;"I gotta ask everybody on the panel"
43:21;43:25;"You know the fruit that's also a color"
43:25;43:27;"Starts with an O?"
43:27;43:29;"Okay, Seinfeld, how do you guys say it?"
43:29;43:30;"Orange"
43:30;43:31;"Nick?"
43:31;43:32;"Orange"
43:32;43:33;"Jake?"
43:33;43:34;"Olive"
43:34;43:35;"Orange"
43:35;43:38;"Wait, okay, Jake's got a touch of"
43:38;43:40;"Orange, let me get an orange"
43:40;43:41;"Orange"
43:41;43:42;"What do you guys say?"
43:42;43:43;"Orange"
43:43;43:44;"I say it as two syllables"
43:44;43:45;"Orange"
43:45;43:46;"You're saying orange"
43:46;43:47;"Orange"
43:47;43:49;"Okay, but me and Alex"
43:49;43:52;"We found out at a dinner that we both"
43:52;43:53;"Orange?"
43:53;43:54;"That we both say orange"
43:54;43:55;"Orange"
43:55;43:57;"F***ing orange over here"
43:57;43:58;"Orange"
43:58;44:00;"Orange, New Jersey"
44:00;44:01;"Is there an orange New Jersey?"
44:01;44:02;"Yeah, there is an orange New Jersey"
44:02;44:05;"Because we were sitting with a bunch of people at a restaurant"
44:05;44:07;"And I ordered an orange wine"
44:07;44:08;"And then somebody said"
44:08;44:10;"That sounds crazy, what you said"
44:10;44:12;"I heard an orange"
44:12;44:14;"I'm not playing it up"
44:14;44:15;"I'm not playing it up"
44:15;44:16;"I ordered an orange wine"
44:16;44:17;"Okay, hold on, I'll say it more properly"
44:17;44:18;"It's kind of like how you say band"
44:18;44:20;"You say, how do you say band?"
44:20;44:21;"Band"
44:21;44:22;"Yeah, band"
44:22;44:24;"It's a long sound"
44:24;44:27;"So I was out with a band"
44:27;44:28;"And we all, everybody wanted"
44:28;44:30;"And we ordered a bottle of orange wine"
44:30;44:31;"Yeah, orange"
44:31;44:33;"Wait, okay, maybe I'm playing it up"
44:33;44:35;"But no, I definitely say orange"
44:35;44:36;"Okay"
44:36;44:39;"And would you like anything to drink tonight?"
44:39;44:41;"Yes, could I please have an orange wine?"
44:41;44:43;"There, that was me saying it normal"
44:43;44:44;"Anyway, so"
44:44;44:45;"That's trippy"
44:45;44:46;"Somebody else at the table was like"
44:46;44:48;"Wait, you say orange?"
44:48;44:49;"And then we had this conversation"
44:49;44:50;"We went around to the table"
44:50;44:53;"And Alex and I said it the same way"
44:53;44:54;"And then I was saying"
44:54;44:56;"Well, yeah, because I grew up in New Jersey"
44:56;44:58;"So I use that word a lot"
44:58;45:00;"I guess everybody uses that word a lot"
45:00;45:03;"But there's towns in New Jersey called the oranges"
45:03;45:07;"There's West Orange, East Orange, South Orange"
45:07;45:08;"There might even just be an orange"
45:08;45:09;"But there's the oranges"
45:09;45:10;"So then we were talking about it"
45:10;45:12;"And then actually the waitress later"
45:12;45:15;"She said, were you just talking about the oranges?"
45:15;45:16;"Yeah, how do you say it?"
45:16;45:17;"She said, well, I'm from New Jersey"
45:17;45:18;"And I said, oh, get out of here, me too"
45:18;45:20;"And she said, I say orange"
45:20;45:22;"And I said, yeah, that's how I say it, orange"
45:22;45:25;"And she said, my grandpa, he's from New Jersey"
45:25;45:27;"He's an old school New Jersey guy"
45:27;45:28;"And I said, how does he say it?"
45:28;45:31;"She said, he says orange, orange"
45:31;45:32;"His grandfather before him"
45:32;45:33;"West Orange"
45:33;45:37;"And then the more, even more confusing thing"
45:37;45:39;"Is there's two other people at the table"
45:39;45:40;"Who are from New York City"
45:40;45:42;"But they're from Manhattan"
45:42;45:44;"And they say orange"
45:44;45:46;"But I say orange because I'm from Queens maybe"
45:46;45:48;"Like maybe it's an outer borough thing"
45:48;45:51;"And I say orange because I'm from New Jersey"
45:51;45:53;"Which is an outer borough essentially"
45:53;45:54;"In a sense, yeah"
45:54;45:55;"Your dad's from Queens, right?"
45:55;45:56;"Well, my dad's from the Bronx"
45:56;45:57;"Your dad's from the Bronx"
45:57;46:00;"I think I asked him and my dad says orange"
46:00;46:01;"My dad's from the Bronx too"
46:01;46:03;"So that might be something"
46:03;46:05;"Oh, okay, so if your dad's from the Bronx"
46:05;46:07;"You say, you say orange"
46:07;46:08;"No, no, it really could be"
46:08;46:09;"And you would have learned through him"
46:09;46:12;"And he's talking about, oh, we got to run down to South Orange"
46:12;46:14;"Orange"
46:14;46:16;"Yeah, I'm sure when I was a little kid"
46:16;46:18;"My dad was like, this is the color orange"
46:18;46:20;"Orange"
46:20;46:21;"Alright"
46:22;46:27;"Orange is the color of my love"
46:27;46:34;"Fragile orange wind in the garden"
46:34;46:40;"Fragile means that I can hear her flesh"
46:40;46:47;"Crying little rivers in her forearm"
46:47;46:53;"Fragile is that I mourn her death"
46:53;46:58;"As our limbs are twisting in her bedroom"
46:58;47:03;"Lies, lies, lies"
47:03;47:08;"Lies in her eyes"
47:08;47:13;"Lies, lies, lies"
47:13;47:17;"Lies in her eyes"
47:17;47:19;"See, it's also funny because I"
47:19;47:24;"Nobody ever says that I have a New Jersey or New York accent"
47:24;47:27;"In fact, this has happened"
47:27;47:29;"I've probably said this on the show before"
47:29;47:33;"At least once a year for the past 30 years"
47:33;47:35;"No, let's say the past 20 years"
47:35;47:39;"Somebody says to me, where are you from?"
47:39;47:40;"And I say New Jersey and say"
47:40;47:42;"Oh, I thought you were going to say a different country"
47:42;47:44;"I swear"
47:44;47:46;"Dude, you have a touch of that"
47:46;47:50;"High society, can't place it accent"
47:50;47:52;"It's like vaguely English"
47:52;47:53;"It's a bit transatlantic"
47:53;47:55;"It's a bit like"
47:55;47:57;"What's that show with Cynthia Nixon?"
47:57;47:58;"That was on"
47:58;47:59;"Sex and the City"
47:59;48:00;"No, no, no"
48:00;48:01;"The other one, the golden"
48:01;48:04;"What was it? The gilded age"
48:04;48:08;"They all have that kind of turn of the century"
48:08;48:11;"I guess, but clearly I say this word in this way"
48:11;48:12;"It's happened before"
48:12;48:13;"There was an English"
48:13;48:18;"Last year, there was a younger English pop star"
48:18;48:20;"I referred to myself as American"
48:20;48:22;"She was like, no"
48:22;48:24;"What?"
48:24;48:25;"Are you serious right now?"
48:25;48:27;"What? No, no, you're joking"
48:27;48:28;"And I was like, what do you mean?"
48:28;48:30;"I was like, where do you think I was from?"
48:30;48:31;"And I was like, you think I was English?"
48:31;48:32;"She's like, no, of course not"
48:32;48:34;"But I just didn't think that"
48:34;48:36;"I guess sometimes it's people from other countries"
48:36;48:39;"And then this summer, I met a Brazilian person"
48:39;48:41;"And they were going on and on about"
48:41;48:43;"No, no, you don't sound American"
48:43;48:44;"But I do sound American"
48:44;48:46;"Well, whatever"
48:46;48:50;"I guess some people say I don't sound American"
48:50;48:52;"Sorry, my robot is talking"
48:52;48:53;"What was that?"
48:53;48:55;"That was a GPS"
48:55;48:56;"Have you had people who didn't"
48:56;48:59;"They couldn't place you or they thought you were"
48:59;49:00;"It was not a GPS"
49:00;49:04;"I don't drive around Manhattan with a GPS"
49:06;49:10;"Yes, Despot doesn't know his way around Manhattan, guys"
49:10;49:14;"It was a spy thing"
49:14;49:16;"It's a laser shifter"
49:16;49:19;"It tells me where the cops are"
49:19;49:23;"And it shifts their laser frequency"
49:23;49:24;"When they try to gun me"
49:24;49:26;"So that I can't get caught speeding"
49:26;49:28;"Oh yeah, I got one of those, too"
49:28;49:30;"Yeah, they're sick, they work"
49:30;49:33;"So Despot, when we took an informal poll"
49:33;49:35;"From the Time Crisis fan community"
49:35;49:37;"Did you know this is episode 200?"
49:37;49:39;"Of course"
49:39;49:43;"You've been counting them down"
49:43;49:46;"Yeah, it's a momentous occasion"
49:46;49:47;"It's very momentous"
49:47;49:49;"And we asked the community"
49:49;49:51;"For some of their all-time favorite subjects"
49:51;49:53;"And one that came up was"
49:53;49:55;"Despot's in-flight routine"
49:55;49:57;"Which was first mentioned on episode 50"
49:57;50:01;"August 27th, 2017"
50:01;50:04;"Have you taken any long-haul flights recently?"
50:04;50:06;"Since then, yeah"
50:06;50:08;"Recently?"
50:08;50:10;"Not really"
50:10;50:13;"The last time I even went anywhere"
50:13;50:16;"Was LA, and that was in February"
50:16;50:19;"And you've been staying true to this, more or less?"
50:19;50:22;"Yeah, I mean, that was..."
50:22;50:26;"Yeah, I go to sleep or I do nothing"
50:26;50:27;"You just stare"
50:27;50:30;"I don't like watching movies on the plane"
50:30;50:33;"And I don't want to put headphones on"
50:33;50:34;"I don't like that"
50:34;50:36;"I don't listen to music for some reason"
50:36;50:38;"I don't really know why"
50:38;50:41;"I do, you know, it's not even like"
50:41;50:43;"Because I bring my AirPods"
50:43;50:46;"And I'm like, maybe I'm going to want to listen to something"
50:46;50:47;"And I don't, I don't know"
50:47;50:49;"It's hard to listen to music on the plane"
50:49;50:51;"With all that whooshing noise"
50:51;50:52;"You have to crank it up"
50:52;50:53;"It kind of hurts your ears"
50:53;50:57;"Do you even see what the in-flight entertainment is?"
50:57;50:58;"No, I don't care"
50:58;51:00;"I never, no"
51:00;51:01;"Who cares?"
51:01;51:02;"What are you going to do?"
51:02;51:04;"I don't watch movies, that's ridiculous"
51:04;51:05;"You don't look at the flight path?"
51:05;51:08;"You don't see like, oh, I'm, you know, I'm over..."
51:08;51:10;"I have that on sometimes"
51:10;51:12;"And like, I'll look at it, you know"
51:12;51:13;"It's pretty good"
51:13;51:14;"Yeah"
51:14;51:16;"With all this driving you do"
51:16;51:20;"As you're guided around New York City by Sat Nav"
51:20;51:24;"Outside of listening to the navigation"
51:24;51:27;"Or recording an internet radio show"
51:27;51:30;"When you're just driving by yourself in New York"
51:30;51:32;"Sitting in traffic on the BQA"
51:32;51:34;"Are you listening to music then?"
51:34;51:35;"Yeah, definitely"
51:35;51:37;"And you know what I noticed?"
51:37;51:40;"I listen to like, I'll just put on"
51:40;51:43;"Let it Shuffle for me"
51:43;51:44;"But it's not that good"
51:44;51:48;"Like it f***ing, it doesn't really mix it up"
51:48;51:52;"I hate f***ing songs over and over again"
51:52;51:55;"If it keeps playing surf gang songs"
51:55;51:59;"I don't, I'm not, I got nothing against surf gang"
51:59;52:02;"It's not really, like, I'm not that into it"
52:02;52:03;"When people come in my car, they're like"
52:03;52:05;"Damn, you really like surf gang"
52:05;52:07;"And it's kind of embarrassing"
52:07;52:09;"Because I'm like, I don't"
52:09;52:12;"I love, hey, you know, shout out to surf gang"
52:12;52:14;"I like a lot of their music"
52:14;52:16;"But I don't know how that happened"
52:16;52:17;"And I, and"
52:17;52:19;"It just makes you seem like a super fan"
52:19;52:21;"Yeah, and I don't, I'm not"
52:21;52:23;"And someone guessed that maybe"
52:23;52:26;"I accidentally like, favorited one of their songs"
52:26;52:29;"That's another thing I don't do, ever in my life"
52:29;52:31;"I don't favorite anything"
52:31;52:33;"I don't favorite tweets"
52:33;52:35;"I don't favorite songs"
52:35;52:37;"Wait, you don't, you don't"
52:37;52:39;"Like a song just so it stays"
52:39;52:41;"And something you can return back to?"
52:41;52:43;"Nah, I just remember it if I like it"
52:43;52:45;"And I'll search for it"
52:45;52:46;"I'm the same way"
52:46;52:49;"But you, you smash the like on Instagram, don't you?"
52:49;52:52;"Yeah, that, I'm a big Instagram liker"
52:52;52:54;"Because that's all you can do, really"
52:54;52:55;"Right, so there you'll do it"
52:55;52:56;"But you don't, you don't favorite tweets"
52:56;52:58;"You don't favorite songs"
52:58;53:01;"I don't, you probably don't favorite texts"
53:01;53:03;"Mmm, no"
53:03;53:05;"I might do a ha-ha, but I don't know"
53:05;53:08;"You don't do the thumbs up with a heart?"
53:08;53:10;"I have, but not really"
53:10;53:14;"Thumbs up for me is gonna be like, passive aggressive"
53:14;53:19;"Yeah, thumbs up from you would feel pretty passive aggressive"
53:19;53:22;"It is also, it is, that is the funniest one"
53:22;53:23;"I'm sure people have said this many times"
53:23;53:25;"But you know, the heart, you loved it"
53:25;53:27;"And the thumbs up is, you liked it"
53:27;53:30;"And normally if you, if it just said"
53:30;53:32;"Somebody liked your text, you'd be like, oh that's cool"
53:32;53:33;"They liked it, there's something about"
53:33;53:36;"Then you see the, the thumbs up"
53:36;53:38;"Even the fact that there's this differentiation"
53:38;53:40;"Between the heart and the thumbs up"
53:40;53:43;"Suddenly, you know, throws this whole other thing"
53:43;53:44;"I'm a big thumbs up guy"
53:44;53:45;"I noticed that"
53:45;53:47;"I love it, I use it unironically"
53:47;53:50;"It's, 'cause heart, hearting is over the top"
53:50;53:51;"Right"
53:51;53:53;"I love it, I love that we're meeting"
53:53;53:56;"At 11.30 for lunch, I, no"
53:56;53:58;"Do you, do you ever use an exclamation point?"
53:58;53:59;"Thumbs up is like, copy that"
53:59;54:01;"Do you ever get a, like a surprising text"
54:01;54:03;"And use an exclamation point?"
54:03;54:06;"Yeah, I'll do the emphasis exclamation point, sure"
54:06;54:09;"I, I use that passive aggressively too"
54:09;54:12;"'Cause, you know, because"
54:12;54:15;"You know, sometimes someone will be like, oh okay"
54:15;54:17;"Like, you know, they'll say something"
54:17;54:18;"And you're just like, okay"
54:18;54:19;"And then they're like, oh"
54:19;54:21;"Well, you seem real excited"
54:21;54:23;"Then I add an exclamation point"
54:23;54:27;"Like, there you go, you f***ing idiot"
54:27;54:29;"Oh, you know what's, you know what's a tricky one"
54:29;54:30;"Is the question mark"
54:30;54:32;"I feel like that's, that's a minefield right there"
54:32;54:33;"Like, that question mark"
54:33;54:35;"Seinfeld questioned"
54:35;54:36;"Yeah, right?"
54:36;54:37;"Right"
54:37;54:38;"Well, yeah, you only use that"
54:38;54:39;"That's the aggressive part"
54:39;54:41;"You only use that to kinda like, annoy somebody"
54:41;54:42;"Yeah, it's very aggressive"
54:42;54:44;"I would only use that with somebody I was very close with"
54:44;54:47;"Like, like a friend that I was kinda f***ed with"
54:47;54:49;"That's kinda like, come on"
54:49;54:51;"Have you seen Ninja Turtles?"
54:51;54:52;"That kinda f***ing"
54:52;54:53;"What the f***"
54:53;54:55;"Or passive aggressive with like, you know, your wife"
54:55;54:56;"Just kinda like"
54:56;54:57;"What?"
54:57;55:00;"I get, I get mad when people"
55:00;55:02;"Are we having dinner tomorrow night?"
55:02;55:05;"Are we having dinner tomorrow night?"
55:05;55:07;"Are we having a barbecue with the neighbors tomorrow?"
55:07;55:09;"That f***ing pisses me off"
55:09;55:12;"Like, why the f*** do you just question mark me?"
55:12;55:14;"In a group chat also?"
55:14;55:16;"Like, oh, in front of everybody"
55:16;55:17;"F***"
55:17;55:19;"You know what's a nice touch?"
55:19;55:22;"Is reacting to your own text"
55:22;55:24;"Like, you type something you think is funny"
55:24;55:26;"And then you put a ""ha ha"" in your own one"
55:26;55:27;"You gotta deploy that"
55:27;55:31;"What's the point of like, if someone takes too long to like, laugh at it"
55:31;55:33;"Then you're like, ""Ah-ah"""
55:33;55:35;"Yeah"
55:35;55:36;"Pick myself up"
55:36;55:41;"And other than passive aggressive, I would say, usage of reacts"
55:41;55:44;"Yeah, are you throwing a question mark on your own one?"
55:44;55:46;"Just like, I'm triggered"
55:46;55:47;"I'm so friggin' random"
55:47;55:50;"Guys, I'm at Fatburger right now"
55:50;55:52;"Guys, I'm at Fat"
55:52;55:53;"Question mark?"
55:53;55:54;"But that's awesome"
55:54;55:57;"Like, you ask the question and they didn't respond"
55:57;56:00;"And you throw a question mark on it like, ""Yo"""
56:00;56:01;"That's true"
56:01;56:02;"Right, that's"
56:02;56:04;"I like putting it on a statement"
56:04;56:06;"That kinda feels"
56:06;56:08;"It's like a Tim Robinson delivery"
56:08;56:11;"Like, ""Uh, guys, I'm at Fatburger right now"""
56:12;56:16;"I can just see Tim Robinson's face like, ""Question mark over your own tip"""
56:16;56:20;"""Um, I guess I'm in Wisconsin?"""
56:20;56:26;"Well, thanks for checking in with us for the Big 200"
56:26;56:28;"Where you driving?"
56:28;56:31;"I'm going to a restaurant called Raff's"
56:31;56:32;"Oh, heard about it"
56:32;56:34;"It's called Raff's?"
56:34;56:37;"Raff's, R-A-F-F"
56:37;56:41;"It's a basketball themed bar, Raff's"
56:41;56:43;"Everything's black and white"
56:43;56:46;"Looks like a footlocker"
56:46;56:49;"Alright, well, enjoy dinner"
56:49;56:51;"We'll talk to you soon"
56:51;56:53;"Thanks for being part of the TC community"
56:53;56:56;"Congratulations on 200"
56:56;56:58;"Thank you very much"
56:58;56:59;"See you soon"
56:59;57:01;"Alright"
57:01;57:02;"Bye"
57:02;57:07;"First one of the evening"
57:07;57:24;"[Instrumental]"
57:24;57:27;"Oh yeah, have one on me"
57:27;57:32;"Of that sweet, sweet chili heat"
57:32;57:36;"Oh yeah, let's take it deep"
57:36;57:40;"With that sweet, sweet chili heat"
57:40;57:47;"Dead night in the Dina at the Old Town Pub"
57:47;57:55;"Two sets at a beer bar, we're drinking no slipper"
57:55;58:01;"But sometimes I gotta take a nip"
58:01;58:05;"Something with heat, something with kick"
58:06;58:12;"So fill that flask with tequila if you please"
58:12;58:18;"Oh yeah, have one on me"
58:18;58:22;"Of that sweet, sweet chili heat"
58:22;58:26;"Oh yeah, let's take it deep"
58:26;58:30;"There's plenty to share, there's more than I need"
58:30;58:34;"So let's take a closer look at the Time Crisis fan favorites"
58:35;58:37;"Seinfeld posted on Twitter"
58:37;58:40;"What are your favorite TC moments of all time?"
58:40;58:42;"Like outside of the top 5, go"
58:42;58:45;"The topics below got the most mentions"
58:45;58:46;"Number 1"
58:46;58:50;"Two fridge/freezer households, Lonnie's dad"
58:50;58:54;"Lonnie's dad was first discussed in episode 63"
58:54;58:57;"Wait, is that true? That's surprising"
58:57;58:58;"Seems late"
58:58;58:59;"It seems late, exactly"
58:59;59:04;"Like to me, the two fridge household/Lonnie's dad"
59:04;59:07;"That's very like foundational TC"
59:07;59:09;"I'm questioning those numbers"
59:09;59:11;"I mean that was 5 years ago"
59:11;59:13;"That is kind of foundational"
59:13;59:16;"Yeah, I guess 5 years ago is a pretty long time"
59:16;59:19;"How many TC's were there before"
59:19;59:22;"It's the canon that we know, you know this group"
59:22;59:23;"There was, how many episodes before?"
59:23;59:24;"Not that many"
59:24;59:28;"I think we kind of locked in within 10 episodes"
59:28;59:30;"Yeah, I was in within the first 10"
59:30;59:32;"I think you had done a couple in New York"
59:32;59:33;"And then you were out here"
59:33;59:34;"And then it was kind of off the races"
59:34;59:36;"And in the beginning was like a bit awkward"
59:36;59:39;"Just trying to do like more interview based"
59:39;59:41;"Jamie Foxx coming through"
59:41;59:43;"Having high profile guests on"
59:43;59:44;"Somebody posted a picture with you"
59:44;59:46;"And you and Jamie Foxx were in the same photo"
59:46;59:50;"And I felt like it was like a collision of like two different eras of TC"
59:50;59:52;"Like I didn't know that you guys actually met"
59:52;59:54;"And are like good friends"
59:54;59:55;"Oh yeah"
59:55;59:57;"Awesome text thread with me, Ezra and Jamie Foxx"
59:57;59:58;"You should see that"
59:58;01:00:00;"A lot of likes"
01:00:00;01:00:02;"A lot of weird exclamation"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"A lot of hearts, a lot of ha-ha's"
01:00:04;01:00:07;"We settled in relatively quickly"
01:00:07;01:00:11;"And I mean for a while there was the kind of East Coast, West Coast TC vibe"
01:00:11;01:00:12;"Sure"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"But then as I essentially started living out here"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"Yeah, we kind of locked in"
01:00:16;01:00:20;"And I think relatively quickly we hit our stride"
01:00:20;01:00:23;"But maybe we really, I mean I guess it makes sense"
01:00:23;01:00:26;"Maybe things take time"
01:00:26;01:00:30;"Like we really probably, it seems like there's a lot of classic stuff in 2018"
01:00:30;01:00:33;"Maybe 2018 is when we really, I'm looking through this"
01:00:33;01:00:36;"2018 we have Lonnie's Dad"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"Juice Island"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"Punisher Burgers"
01:00:40;01:00:43;"Goldfish and Hummus Super Bowl Challenge"
01:00:43;01:00:46;"The first reference to Jam Flow Man was late 2018"
01:00:46;01:00:50;"We got deeper into it in January 2019"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"The Lady Doritos Town Hall"
01:00:52;01:00:56;"Was February 25th, 2018"
01:00:56;01:01:01;"So the Lady Doritos Town Hall featured Chloe Wise, Rashida Jones, and Hannah Fidel"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"In episode 62"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"What was that all about?"
01:01:05;01:01:09;"It's cause Doritos had a female, they were gonna release like a female Dorito"
01:01:09;01:01:12;"That didn't leave dust on your fingertips"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"Oh"
01:01:13;01:01:14;"As I recall and then we"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"And was it in like a pink bag?"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"No that was part of, I think that was part of the Doritos Town Hall"
01:01:18;01:01:22;"Didn't Doritos get a lady CEO?"
01:01:22;01:01:23;"And that was part of it?"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"That sounds familiar, yeah"
01:01:25;01:01:30;"Frito-Lay's probably kicking themselves that they didn't hire Greta Gerwig to direct the Doritos movie"
01:01:30;01:01:32;"Not too late, or maybe"
01:01:32;01:01:33;"Yeah, okay"
01:01:33;01:01:36;"There was a report in Ad Age"
01:01:36;01:01:41;"That Doritos was working on a specific Doritos for female consumers"
01:01:41;01:01:45;"As their needs and preferences were evolving"
01:01:45;01:01:46;"And then they had to walk it back"
01:01:46;01:01:49;"Doritos had to deny that they were doing this"
01:01:49;01:01:50;"And I think that was"
01:01:50;01:01:53;"You know what, I think a lot of our classic stuff was from the top 5 too"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"Like the Ed Sheeran bed sheet stuff"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"That was before 2018, right?"
01:01:57;01:01:58;"Right"
01:01:58;01:02:01;"That was like 20, I don't know when that was"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"I'm gonna guess that's earlier"
01:02:03;01:02:04;"17, 16"
01:02:04;01:02:08;"Jake not knowing Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas is You"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"That took place"
01:02:10;01:02:11;"2018? Really?"
01:02:11;01:02:12;"In late 2018"
01:02:12;01:02:15;"See that doesn't, that doesn't track for me"
01:02:15;01:02:16;"I think that would have been earlier"
01:02:16;01:02:17;"Time flies"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"I mean it's still 5 years ago"
01:02:19;01:02:20;"I would have thought that would be year 1"
01:02:20;01:02:24;"Because I remember we did like a Christmas episode in 2015"
01:02:24;01:02:28;"The most recent thing on this list is Big League Chew"
01:02:28;01:02:30;"Todd Field in Big League Chew"
01:02:30;01:02:31;"That was pretty classic"
01:02:31;01:02:34;"That was only October 2022"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"Herm Yarl was December 2020"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"That feels like yesterday"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"The Lord Hathaway baseball player"
01:02:40;01:02:43;"I don't remember what that is at all"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"I've heard about that one because"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"You've heard about that one?"
01:02:47;01:02:51;"I've heard about that one because people seem to like it"
01:02:51;01:02:55;"Grape ice cream, of course I remember grape ice cream"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"You know what I don't remember at all?"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"Popcorn and raisins"
01:02:59;01:03:00;"What was it?"
01:03:00;01:03:03;"It was so big we made merch"
01:03:03;01:03:06;"I know, I was wearing this sweatshirt last weekend"
01:03:06;01:03:10;"We were camping with some other families"
01:03:10;01:03:13;"And one of the dads was like ""What's that sweatshirt? What's the deal?"""
01:03:13;01:03:18;"And I was like ""Well, it's like a very inside baseball joke"""
01:03:18;01:03:21;"I had to just kind of, just for, because he's a civilian"
01:03:21;01:03:24;"I had to shorthand it, I said ""For a podcast that I'm involved in"""
01:03:24;01:03:27;"I couldn't, I just didn't have it in me at that moment"
01:03:27;01:03:31;"To just do the whole history of the internet radio show"
01:03:31;01:03:37;"But also you didn't want to just say ""Internet radio show"" and move on?"
01:03:37;01:03:42;"I wanted to just move on, I didn't want to dwell on the sweatshirt"
01:03:42;01:03:46;"What if you said ""Oh, that sounds interesting, tell me more about it"""
01:03:46;01:03:49;"No, because the vibe I was giving off was"
01:03:49;01:03:52;"Because I didn't remember the origin of the joke, this is why I'm bringing it up"
01:03:52;01:03:57;"So I was sort of just like ""Can we just move on? I don't want to talk about this shirt"""
01:03:57;01:04:02;"Because I don't even know what the, I don't remember the origin story"
01:04:02;01:04:05;"So I was like ""It's an esoteric joke"""
01:04:05;01:04:07;"It's a deep cut, it's a deep cut"
01:04:07;01:04:10;"I mean, the truth is, I think it's just something"
01:04:10;01:04:15;"It was like a running gag that maybe only I thought was funny"
01:04:15;01:04:18;"What was the gag? Was it the worst snack ever?"
01:04:18;01:04:22;"I would sort of try to pitch this, right?"
01:04:22;01:04:24;"As a snack idea"
01:04:24;01:04:26;"And it came up a few times"
01:04:26;01:04:30;"I mean, it's a great sweatshirt"
01:04:30;01:04:31;"I appreciate that"
01:04:31;01:04:32;"A gorgeous sweatshirt"
01:04:32;01:04:33;"I wear it a lot"
01:04:33;01:04:35;"It's like a bottled after a vampire weekend"
01:04:35;01:04:36;"Oh right, it's the collegiate look"
01:04:36;01:04:37;"Right, yeah"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"You should have just said ""This is where I went to college"""
01:04:39;01:04:43;"That's where I got my degree"
01:04:43;01:04:48;"I do remember pitching it once to a friend of the show, Kazzy David"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"And she was disgusted"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"And I think that's where it peaked"
01:04:52;01:04:54;"Where she was like, she thought it was such a grotesque"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"I think it's my favorite piece of TC merch"
01:04:56;01:04:59;"I mean, the tie-dye 8-Minute Cape Cod is a classic"
01:04:59;01:05:00;"I wear that a lot too"
01:05:00;01:05:04;"Do you remember we donated the proceeds to Broke Vegans?"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"The popcorn and raisins proceeds?"
01:05:06;01:05:07;"Do you remember this?"
01:05:07;01:05:08;"There was an initiative"
01:05:08;01:05:09;"Vaguely"
01:05:09;01:05:10;"And I really did this"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"You found a few Broke Vegans?"
01:05:12;01:05:16;"There was something on Twitter where Broke Vegans had to state their case"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"And I think I wound up"
01:05:18;01:05:20;"I think I was in Japan at the time"
01:05:20;01:05:24;"And I divided up however couple hundred dollars we had profited"
01:05:24;01:05:27;"And then gave it to a few Broke Vegans"
01:05:27;01:05:30;"And then this quote-unquote made like $40"
01:05:30;01:05:32;"I have to interject here guys"
01:05:32;01:05:35;"Our audience might be confused"
01:05:35;01:05:38;"Because it turns out"
01:05:38;01:05:40;"That the popcorn and raisins bit"
01:05:40;01:05:43;"Actually was cut from the show"
01:05:43;01:05:44;"What?"
01:05:44;01:05:45;"Yeah"
01:05:45;01:05:47;"It's original mention didn't actually make the show"
01:05:47;01:05:48;"Because"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"I don't know if we're giving too much away here"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"But you know, we talk for a long time"
01:05:52;01:05:53;"And I think that it's"
01:05:53;01:05:56;"The reason it's presented in such a tight, incredible form"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"Because of our editors"
01:05:57;01:05:58;"Oh yeah"
01:05:58;01:05:59;"Wait a second"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"And so this joke"
01:06:01;01:06:03;"We thought maybe the rest of the world had shared with us"
01:06:03;01:06:04;"Was actually cut"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"So we must have brought it up again"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"Because people know what popcorn and raisins"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"Yes, but I don't know in what kind"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"So maybe people have been confused the whole time"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"They don't know the origin story"
01:06:14;01:06:16;"We don't know the origin story"
01:06:16;01:06:19;"This is a reference without a reference"
01:06:19;01:06:23;"Hold on, maybe Matt can you just chime in and explain this to us?"
01:06:23;01:06:24;"Yes"
01:06:24;01:06:25;"This is actually"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"This is one of my deepest time crisis shames"
01:06:27;01:06:28;"Oh my"
01:06:28;01:06:32;"I cut the popcorn and raisins bit"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"The original mention for time reasons"
01:06:34;01:06:38;"And Seinfeld continued to go on Twitter"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"And talk about it"
01:06:40;01:06:42;"So this whole time"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"I've watched you guys talk about popcorn and raisins"
01:06:44;01:06:47;"And there was never the initial mention"
01:06:47;01:06:48;"Wow"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"So it went from being something that was talked about on Twitter"
01:06:50;01:06:51;"Into casual comments"
01:06:51;01:06:52;"So you've selectively"
01:06:52;01:06:53;"Without people knowing"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"As a result of your selective editing"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"I've seemed completely insane"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"On the show"
01:06:59;01:07:02;"Talking about something we can't root back to anything"
01:07:02;01:07:03;"In reality"
01:07:03;01:07:04;"Oh that makes so much more sense now"
01:07:04;01:07:05;"Popcorn and raisins"
01:07:05;01:07:07;"Oh sh*t"
01:07:07;01:07:09;"I thought it made our Twitter seem more fun"
01:07:09;01:07:10;"Okay"
01:07:10;01:07:11;"Yeah like it was just"
01:07:11;01:07:12;"Yeah"
01:07:12;01:07:13;"Because you probably said"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"Do you guys think popcorn and raisins sounds like a great snack"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"So there's a little bit of context"
01:07:17;01:07:20;"Next time a normal person"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Asks you about your sweatshirt"
01:07:22;01:07:23;"Hey man"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"What's popcorn and raisins?"
01:07:25;01:07:26;"And say"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"Okay buddy I see where the confusion is"
01:07:28;01:07:29;"Famously"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"Imagine you're just talking to some random dad"
01:07:32;01:07:33;"Episode 62"
01:07:33;01:07:36;"Famously the episode 62 Seinfeld 2000"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"Initial reference was cut"
01:07:38;01:07:39;"By the producer"
01:07:39;01:07:40;"However on Twitter"
01:07:40;01:07:41;"He kept"
01:07:41;01:07:42;"He kept talking about it"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"And became an important part of the time crisis community"
01:07:44;01:07:46;"I hope that clears things up"
01:07:46;01:07:47;"The guy's like"
01:07:47;01:07:48;"Not at all"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"What are you talking about?"
01:07:50;01:07:52;"On a more serious note"
01:07:52;01:07:55;"Someone did tweet recently"
01:07:55;01:07:59;"Like what is the proper ratio of popcorn to raisins?"
01:07:59;01:08:00;"And I just said"
01:08:00;01:08:01;"I said 1 to 1"
01:08:01;01:08:02;"But I would be curious"
01:08:02;01:08:06;"Or are you guys picturing more popcorn"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"Yeah I'm thinking 70 to 30"
01:08:08;01:08:09;"70 to 3?"
01:08:09;01:08:10;"80 to 20"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"No you gotta go 50 50"
01:08:13;01:08:14;"Ugh"
01:08:14;01:08:15;"Ew"
01:08:15;01:08:16;"And I like the idea"
01:08:16;01:08:17;"And I think that's gross"
01:08:17;01:08:19;"It's okay"
01:08:19;01:08:20;"Well"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"I guess it's to each his own"
01:08:22;01:08:23;"Sure"
01:08:23;01:08:24;"I think"
01:08:24;01:08:28;"The Lord Hathaway baseball player was"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"On the sillier side of the TC spectrum"
01:08:30;01:08:32;"It was something about"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"I guess we were talking about baseball being boring"
01:08:34;01:08:35;"And we were saying"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"There should be more like characters"
01:08:37;01:08:39;"A la wrestling"
01:08:39;01:08:43;"And so we kind of created a character called Lord Hathaway"
01:08:43;01:08:44;"Who's kind of like"
01:08:44;01:08:45;"Uh"
01:08:45;01:08:47;"You know like the kind of guy that the crowd would boo"
01:08:47;01:08:48;"Uh huh"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"Like a rich fancy guy"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"Like he comes out and the working class crowd is like"
01:08:52;01:08:53;"Oh no"
01:08:53;01:08:54;"And Lord Hathaway is just like"
01:08:54;01:08:55;"Whatever"
01:08:55;01:08:57;"And I think he has his butler come out"
01:08:57;01:08:59;"And brush the plate"
01:08:59;01:09:00;"That's the thing that I remember"
01:09:00;01:09:01;"I kind of remember that"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"And everybody's like oh this f***ing guy"
01:09:03;01:09:04;"Yeah a heel"
01:09:04;01:09:05;"A heel of baseball"
01:09:05;01:09:06;"Yeah a heel"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"What else do we have on this list?"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"The worst margarita of Jake's life"
01:09:10;01:09:11;"I mean that had a long life"
01:09:11;01:09:14;"Became a Mountain Brew song"
01:09:14;01:09:15;"Um"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"The Larry David cameo"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"That's pretty legendary"
01:09:19;01:09:22;"Vin Diesel covering It Ain't Me by Kygo"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"2017"
01:09:24;01:09:25;"Getting a little deep"
01:09:25;01:09:26;"Early"
01:09:26;01:09:27;"Okay episode 38"
01:09:27;01:09:28;"That's pretty early"
01:09:28;01:09:29;"Yeah"
01:09:29;01:09:30;"Abscond with the bread"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"Yeah of course I remember that phrase"
01:09:33;01:09:34;"Alright"
01:09:34;01:09:35;"What was the one that I"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"On the text thread that sounded interesting"
01:09:37;01:09:38;"It was like really early"
01:09:38;01:09:39;"It was like episode 20"
01:09:39;01:09:40;"Hmm"
01:09:40;01:09:41;"Can I"
01:09:41;01:09:42;"I want to say briefly"
01:09:42;01:09:43;"I"
01:09:43;01:09:44;"As far as regrets go"
01:09:44;01:09:45;"The Larry David cameo"
01:09:45;01:09:46;"You know for years"
01:09:46;01:09:49;"I've been wondering what Seinfeld would be like today"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"And I think about this from time to time"
01:09:51;01:09:53;"Larry David unexpectedly joins the show"
01:09:53;01:09:55;"And I froze like a deer in headlights"
01:09:55;01:09:56;"I like"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"I was so stunned by his appearance"
01:09:58;01:10:00;"That I feel like I um"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"I could have shot my shot"
01:10:02;01:10:03;"And uh"
01:10:03;01:10:05;"And for some reason I just was paralyzed"
01:10:05;01:10:06;"By him"
01:10:06;01:10:07;"I was so surprised"
01:10:07;01:10:08;"You just couldn't believe it"
01:10:08;01:10:09;"I couldn't believe it"
01:10:09;01:10:10;"And I just froze up"
01:10:10;01:10:11;"And you"
01:10:11;01:10:12;"You had a very"
01:10:12;01:10:13;"You had a great interview with him"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"Um"
01:10:14;01:10:15;"Maybe it's for the best"
01:10:15;01:10:16;"Maybe that's"
01:10:16;01:10:17;"Maybe that's the way"
01:10:17;01:10:18;"Uh"
01:10:18;01:10:19;"It was supposed to go"
01:10:19;01:10:20;"But"
01:10:20;01:10:21;"He might have freaked out"
01:10:21;01:10:22;"He might have"
01:10:22;01:10:23;"Yeah well that's true"
01:10:23;01:10:24;"Well cause also he"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"He might have mistook you for"
01:10:26;01:10:27;"Modern Seinfeld"
01:10:27;01:10:28;"Or some other account"
01:10:28;01:10:29;"Like I could imagine"
01:10:29;01:10:30;"If you were like"
01:10:30;01:10:31;"If you were just like"
01:10:31;01:10:32;"Um"
01:10:32;01:10:33;"Larry I just wanted to ask"
01:10:33;01:10:34;"Um"
01:10:34;01:10:35;"What do you think um"
01:10:35;01:10:36;"Seinfeld would be like today"
01:10:36;01:10:37;"Do you think um"
01:10:37;01:10:38;"You know"
01:10:38;01:10:39;"Uh"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"Garge might have iPad"
01:10:41;01:10:42;"Or Cray"
01:10:42;01:10:43;"And he's just like"
01:10:43;01:10:44;"I can just picture him like"
01:10:44;01:10:45;"Rudy Giuliani style"
01:10:45;01:10:46;"Freak out like"
01:10:46;01:10:47;"Oh here we f***"
01:10:47;01:10:48;"Kazzy who are these"
01:10:48;01:10:49;"Is this f***"
01:10:49;01:10:50;"These are these f***"
01:10:50;01:10:51;"I've been hearing about"
01:10:51;01:10:52;"Oh my god"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"Enough you're sick"
01:10:53;01:10:54;"There's something wrong with you"
01:10:54;01:10:55;"Right"
01:10:55;01:10:56;"Enough"
01:10:56;01:10:57;"That"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"Right"
01:10:58;01:10:59;"That may have been what I wanted to avoid"
01:10:59;01:11:00;"Um"
01:11:00;01:11:01;"I found it"
01:11:01;01:11:02;"Uh 20"
01:11:02;01:11:03;"Episode 22"
01:11:03;01:11:04;"The Peter Cetera"
01:11:04;01:11:05;"Glory of love discussion"
01:11:05;01:11:06;"Which dovetailed into Nixon"
01:11:06;01:11:07;"And postmodernism"
01:11:07;01:11:08;"And then Jake replies"
01:11:08;01:11:09;"That sounds interesting"
01:11:09;01:11:10;"Right"
01:11:10;01:11:11;"It does"
01:11:11;01:11:12;"Zero memory of it"
01:11:12;01:11:13;"But"
01:11:13;01:11:14;"I also don't remember that"
01:11:14;01:11:17;"I mean everything kind of comes back to postmodernism"
01:11:17;01:11:18;"I mean"
01:11:18;01:11:19;"Talking about culture"
01:11:19;01:11:20;"Yeah"
01:11:20;01:11:21;"Your uh"
01:11:21;01:11:22;"Your riff on uh"
01:11:22;01:11:23;"The I uh"
01:11:23;01:11:24;"I P"
01:11:24;01:11:25;"I P S L"
01:11:26;01:11:27;"Yeah the I P S L riff"
01:11:27;01:11:28;"I mean it's"
01:11:28;01:11:29;"Yeah we're so far gone"
01:11:29;01:11:30;"It's sometimes"
01:11:30;01:11:31;"It's"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"It almost feels like silly to say it like"
01:11:32;01:11:33;"Yeah we know"
01:11:33;01:11:34;"We know we're in the desert of the real grandpa"
01:11:34;01:11:35;"Come on man"
01:11:35;01:11:36;"Why don't we get into the top five"
01:11:36;01:11:37;"And we got something kind of"
01:11:37;01:11:38;"Kind of interesting"
01:11:38;01:11:39;"I mean"
01:11:42;01:11:43;"We're in the top five"
01:11:43;01:11:44;"And we got something kind of exciting"
01:11:44;01:11:45;"For our big two hundredth episode"
01:11:45;01:11:49;"It's time for the top five"
01:11:49;01:11:53;"Five on iTunes"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"This week we're gonna be comparing"
01:11:55;01:11:58;"The top five songs"
01:11:58;01:11:59;"Right now"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"On Apple Music"
01:12:01;01:12:03;"Versus the top five Billboard"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"Hot 100 songs"
01:12:05;01:12:07;"Of the week that TC first aired"
01:12:07;01:12:10;"Which is July 12th, 2015"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"So just about eight years"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"A little bit over eight years"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"We'll be taking a ride back to the"
01:12:16;01:12:19;"Cultural milieu in which this show started"
01:12:19;01:12:22;"So we're gonna start with the top five song"
01:12:22;01:12:25;"The week that TC first aired"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"2015"
01:12:27;01:12:28;"Fetty Wap"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"With Trap Queen"
01:12:30;01:12:33;"Yeah this does feel like a pretty long time ago"
01:12:33;01:12:36;"It's pre-Trump era EDM"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"Right"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"2015"
01:12:40;01:12:41;"That was a real classic phrase"
01:12:41;01:12:42;"That got thrown around"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"2017 to 2020"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"Trump era EDM"
01:12:46;01:12:47;"Oh yeah"
01:12:47;01:13:03;"Did you do a top five the first episode?"
01:13:03;01:13:05;"Do you remember?"
01:13:05;01:13:07;"I don't remember"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"I remember you played a lot of Billy Joel"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"On the first episode"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"And that kind of got the internet going for about five minutes"
01:13:14;01:13:15;"Yeah"
01:13:15;01:13:16;"Like this guy"
01:13:16;01:13:19;"The guy from Vampire Weekends played Billy Joel"
01:13:19;01:13:21;"On this new Apple Music service"
01:13:21;01:13:22;"It took a while"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"I mean I'm sure when the show started"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"People were expecting"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"You know just like me playing some cool music"
01:13:28;01:13:29;"Uh huh"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"Hey guys"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"Actually this is a band that"
01:13:33;01:13:36;"You know doing some interesting things in Brooklyn right now"
01:13:36;01:13:39;"Uh they just released their first EP"
01:13:39;01:13:40;"It's getting a little bit of buzz"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"And I really like track two"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"So uh here it is"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"Yeah college DJ"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"Yeah"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"Ezra's back in his college DJ mode"
01:13:50;01:13:51;"No you're going"
01:13:51;01:13:53;"Playing songs off The Stranger"
01:13:53;01:13:54;"Yeah"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"And then you have me on"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"Maybe episode four or five"
01:13:58;01:13:59;"What am I bringing to the table?"
01:13:59;01:14:00;"The Eagles"
01:14:00;01:14:01;"The Eagles and The Dead"
01:14:01;01:14:02;"Oh and The Dead"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"When I remember when you first came on to discuss The Dead"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"I took a"
01:14:06;01:14:07;"I did kind of like a character"
01:14:07;01:14:08;"That was like combative"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"It was like kids don't care about the dead man"
01:14:10;01:14:11;"Make your case"
01:14:11;01:14:12;"Little did we know"
01:14:12;01:14:13;"Was that a character?"
01:14:13;01:14:15;"I think that was pre your conversion"
01:14:15;01:14:18;"Because I remember playing Scarlett Begonia's"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"And you were like"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"We listened to like the first two verses"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"Or verse chorus kind of thing"
01:14:24;01:14:25;"And you like cut it off"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"And I was like wait for the solo man"
01:14:27;01:14:29;"I have a vivid memory of that"
01:14:29;01:14:31;"Well it was like half and half"
01:14:31;01:14:33;"I hadn't been"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"I was already you know"
01:14:35;01:14:36;"Curious"
01:14:36;01:14:37;"Richard Pictures pilled"
01:14:37;01:14:38;"Oh that's right I guess so"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"And I was you know"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"And I just had my like soft spot"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"East coast soft spot"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"So I was halfway there"
01:14:46;01:14:47;"But one thing for sure"
01:14:47;01:14:49;"I didn't see or feel"
01:14:49;01:14:52;"The huge resurgence on the horizon"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"So my feeling was a little bit like"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"Yeah I like this but you know"
01:14:56;01:14:57;"Yeah that's what's"
01:14:57;01:14:58;"Other people don't really care"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"Funny about Richard Pictures"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"Was when we started it"
01:15:02;01:15:03;"It's funny to say this"
01:15:03;01:15:06;"In 2014 it really was a different context"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"It did seem kind of weird"
01:15:08;01:15:10;"And now it almost seems like played out"
01:15:10;01:15:12;"To have a Grateful Dead cover band"
01:15:12;01:15:13;"There's so many of them"
01:15:13;01:15:14;"And that's great"
01:15:14;01:15:15;"It's great for the"
01:15:15;01:15:16;"It's very fun for the scene"
01:15:16;01:15:17;"We played some shows this summer"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"And like the crowds were awesome"
01:15:19;01:15:21;"There was a lot of young people there"
01:15:21;01:15:22;"In a way that when we played shows"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"In like 2015 it was like"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"Old heads"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"And now it's like all kids"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"With like new merch"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"Oh, remember me boys"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"Remember me boys"
01:15:35;01:15:36;"That was Fetty Wap"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"One of my favorite rap songs"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"From the 2010s"
01:15:40;01:15:43;"Yeah when I first saw Richard Pictures play"
01:15:43;01:15:44;"When do you think that was?"
01:15:44;01:15:45;"2014?"
01:15:45;01:15:47;"2014 is when we started playing shows"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"I think I saw one of your first shows"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"I think you saw the first one"
01:15:51;01:15:53;"At that place Pear Space"
01:15:53;01:15:54;"Yeah it's funny"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"I remember having a feeling"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"That you know like Joe Walsh said"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"Life as it's coming at you"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"Feels like a bunch of chaotic"
01:16:02;01:16:05;"Chaos and meaningless chaos"
01:16:05;01:16:08;"But then as you look backwards"
01:16:08;01:16:11;"It's like a finely written novel man"
01:16:11;01:16:14;"A finely crafted novel"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"Because I can look back now"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"And I can like clockwork"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"I can look at these eras"
01:16:20;01:16:23;"Because 2014 to me"
01:16:23;01:16:27;"Was the end of my first experience"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"With indie"
01:16:29;01:16:30;"You know I always felt like"
01:16:30;01:16:31;"With Vampire Weekend"
01:16:31;01:16:32;"I can look back now and say"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"Yeah of course we were part of a bigger thing"
01:16:34;01:16:35;"But you know at the time"
01:16:35;01:16:36;"I always felt like well you know"
01:16:36;01:16:37;"We started up at like college"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"And Morningside Heights"
01:16:39;01:16:40;"I didn't feel very connected"
01:16:40;01:16:42;"To Brooklyn stuff"
01:16:42;01:16:43;"And the Brooklyn wave"
01:16:43;01:16:45;"And all those kind of bands"
01:16:45;01:16:46;"And I always felt like"
01:16:46;01:16:47;"Well it's a coincidence"
01:16:47;01:16:48;"I happen to know Dave"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"Your brother from Dirty Projectors"
01:16:50;01:16:51;"But the idea this is like a scene"
01:16:51;01:16:53;"I don't know who Animal Collective is"
01:16:53;01:16:54;"I always you know"
01:16:54;01:16:55;"Of course I can look back"
01:16:55;01:16:56;"And say it was a time and a place"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"But if I look at that whole era"
01:16:58;01:17:01;"To me that era felt really over"
01:17:01;01:17:02;"In 2014"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"Especially just for me"
01:17:04;01:17:07;"Because 2014 was the end of touring"
01:17:07;01:17:08;"Modern Vampires"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"And I had this kind of exhausted feeling"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"Of like wow"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"I just you know blinked"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"And all these years went by"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"Time waits for no one"
01:17:18;01:17:19;"Things had moved on"
01:17:19;01:17:22;"And so to have this feeling 2014"
01:17:22;01:17:23;"I don't know what I was doing in LA at the time"
01:17:23;01:17:25;"But probably just like"
01:17:25;01:17:26;"Hanging out"
01:17:26;01:17:27;"Thinking about what to do next"
01:17:27;01:17:29;"And then to see Richard Pictures"
01:17:29;01:17:30;"Right at that"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"At the end of something"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"And I remember thinking like"
01:17:34;01:17:35;"This is the best thing I've seen"
01:17:35;01:17:36;"In a long time"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"Finally a band that I like"
01:17:38;01:17:40;"Because I was feeling like"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"Who cares about indie bands anymore"
01:17:42;01:17:43;"Nobody cares anymore"
01:17:43;01:17:44;"It's played out whatever"
01:17:44;01:17:45;"And then I see"
01:17:45;01:17:47;"Finally see a guitar band"
01:17:47;01:17:48;"That I liked"
01:17:48;01:17:49;"And that got me kind of"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"Reinvigorated and excited"
01:17:51;01:17:52;"About guitar music again"
01:17:52;01:17:54;"The fact that it happened to be"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"My dear friend Jake"
01:17:56;01:17:57;"The American Painter"
01:17:57;01:17:59;"And Radio Personality's cover band"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"Just makes it that much better"
01:18:01;01:18:03;"But I remember feeling a little bit like"
01:18:03;01:18:04;"Something had ended"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"And then where I least expected it"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"I see something exciting again"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"And you know I've always said that"
01:18:10;01:18:11;"When I was doing like press for"
01:18:11;01:18:12;"Father of the Bride"
01:18:12;01:18:13;"And then it took us"
01:18:13;01:18:16;"Five years I guess to get that album out"
01:18:16;01:18:17;"You know working slow"
01:18:17;01:18:18;"And doing other stuff"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"But when I first saw you guys"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"It was no feeling of"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"Yeah you know what"
01:18:24;01:18:25;"It's cool because"
01:18:25;01:18:27;"I've been noticing these cool"
01:18:27;01:18:29;"Like Grateful Dead shirts popping up"
01:18:29;01:18:31;"There truly was none of that"
01:18:31;01:18:34;"The excitement was purely about the music"
01:18:34;01:18:35;"Who could have predicted that"
01:18:35;01:18:36;"Over the next"
01:18:36;01:18:37;"Yeah it's crazy"
01:18:37;01:18:38;"Eight years"
01:18:38;01:18:41;"Was Dead & Co. even a thing in 2014?"
01:18:41;01:18:43;"No I think that started in 2015"
01:18:43;01:18:44;"Wow"
01:18:44;01:18:45;"Because I remember when we started"
01:18:45;01:18:46;"Doing the show in 2015"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"That was the 50th anniversary"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"And that was famously"
01:18:50;01:18:51;"You were famously unimpressed"
01:18:51;01:18:53;"The first time you saw them"
01:18:53;01:18:55;"You said John Merrill lacked tone"
01:18:55;01:18:56;"Right"
01:18:56;01:18:57;"Was that 2015?"
01:18:57;01:18:59;"Yeah I went to the Hollywood Bowl show"
01:18:59;01:19:00;"That's when they formed"
01:19:00;01:19:01;"Was 2015?"
01:19:01;01:19:02;"Yeah"
01:19:02;01:19:03;"So what a difference a year makes"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"Yeah"
01:19:04;01:19:05;"Anyway"
01:19:05;01:19:06;"And so that got something moving"
01:19:06;01:19:07;"But even that still seemed a little bit"
01:19:07;01:19:09;"Like you know the heads were excited"
01:19:09;01:19:11;"But it still seemed a little fuddy-duddy"
01:19:11;01:19:12;"You know"
01:19:12;01:19:13;"Well initially it was like three shows"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"They were like we're playing like"
01:19:15;01:19:17;"In Shoreline Amphitheater"
01:19:17;01:19:19;"And in Chicago"
01:19:19;01:19:20;"And like Trey was gonna come out"
01:19:20;01:19:21;"Yeah"
01:19:21;01:19:22;"And like they did three shows"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"And it was like oh it's the 50th anniversary"
01:19:24;01:19:27;"It's the 30th anniversary of Jerry Garcia's death"
01:19:27;01:19:28;"You know like summer"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"August of 2015"
01:19:30;01:19:31;"Right"
01:19:31;01:19:32;"So it only became really a thing"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"Maybe 2016, 2017"
01:19:34;01:19:35;"Or I guess his 20th anniversary"
01:19:35;01:19:36;"I don't know"
01:19:36;01:19:37;"Anyway"
01:19:37;01:19:38;"Suffice to say"
01:19:38;01:19:41;"The Richard Pictures Live in LA 2014"
01:19:41;01:19:45;"Was truly you know a spark in the dark"
01:19:45;01:19:48;"Years before you would walk to like"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"You know a cool cafe"
01:19:50;01:19:51;"And see people wearing like"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"Online ceramics shirts and stuff"
01:19:53;01:19:54;"Online ceramics was selling stuff"
01:19:54;01:19:55;"At our early shows"
01:19:55;01:19:56;"Interesting"
01:19:56;01:19:57;"Yeah"
01:19:57;01:19:58;"I remember that guy Alex"
01:19:58;01:19:59;"That was one of the co-founders"
01:19:59;01:20:01;"He was at all our early shows"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"I have some early online ceramic shirts"
01:20:03;01:20:04;"Wow"
01:20:04;01:20:07;"They are grailed by some folks"
01:20:07;01:20:11;"They're sitting in the bottom of my t-shirt drawer"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"Always picking that"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"Popcorn and raisins over it"
01:20:15;01:20:16;"You might wanna sell those"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"But anyway"
01:20:18;01:20:21;"I'm glad that Richard Pictures is still going"
01:20:21;01:20:22;"You were there before it was cool"
01:20:22;01:20:23;"You're there when it's cool"
01:20:23;01:20:24;"You're still there"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"Even if it's less cool"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"Riding that wave"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"The number five song this week"
01:20:30;01:20:31;"On Apple Music"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"Zach Bryan"
01:20:33;01:20:34;"""Hey Driver"""
01:20:34;01:20:36;"Featuring the Warren Treaty"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"And now we have a Zach Bryan super fan"
01:20:38;01:20:39;"Here"
01:20:39;01:20:40;"It's true"
01:20:40;01:20:41;"It's Jake"
01:20:41;01:20:42;"Just kidding"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"It's Nick"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"I'm wearing the merch"
01:20:46;01:20:48;"I'm even wearing the merch"
01:20:48;01:20:54;"To a place they still put sugar in their iced tea"
01:20:54;01:20:57;"Where the women are fine and the love is gay"
01:20:57;01:20:58;"So this is unusual"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"First of all I'm surprised this is one of the ones that charted"
01:21:00;01:21:01;"Because this is"
01:21:01;01:21:03;"Definitely all of the songs from this album that came out"
01:21:03;01:21:04;"Friday"
01:21:04;01:21:05;"They're all charting"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"But this is not one of the singles"
01:21:07;01:21:10;"It's the Casey Musgrave song that's a big one"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"And then one of his other duets"
01:21:12;01:21:16;"With this other great young country singer, Ciara"
01:21:16;01:21:20;"Maybe soon you need to do a whole Zach Bryan episode"
01:21:20;01:21:23;"Because I have yet to go deep on him"
01:21:23;01:21:24;"Have you, Jake?"
01:21:24;01:21:25;"No I haven't"
01:21:25;01:21:26;"Do you know who he is?"
01:21:26;01:21:27;"Yeah"
01:21:27;01:21:28;"What do you know about him?"
01:21:28;01:21:29;"He's unavoidable"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"I mean I was just skimming the Stephen Hyden article this morning"
01:21:31;01:21:32;"I'd like to hear you"
01:21:32;01:21:33;"While I was drinking some coffee"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"I mean I know he did ""Eight Years in the Navy"""
01:21:35;01:21:37;"He's from Oklahoma"
01:21:37;01:21:40;"Started releasing music in 2021 on Twitter"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"Or Instagram"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"I've listened to some of it"
01:21:44;01:21:45;"I dig it"
01:21:45;01:21:47;"I just haven't gone deep"
01:21:47;01:21:49;"I was going to put a mix together"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"Maybe that's something we can"
01:21:51;01:21:53;"Yeah because you told me that you've been to a bunch of shows"
01:21:53;01:21:57;"And you said there's almost a Bruce Springsteen energy"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"And my feeling was"
01:21:59;01:22:02;"Okay, most of what I've heard from him is kind of like"
01:22:02;01:22:04;"Ballady?"
01:22:04;01:22:05;"Right"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"Or you know this song's got no drums"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"Does he have boogie woogie songs?"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"Yeah, and it rips"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"I mean he has big sounding big drum songs"
01:22:13;01:22:15;"I think the ones that you've heard"
01:22:15;01:22:17;"They definitely"
01:22:17;01:22:20;"Does a lot of his stuff have this kind of like"
01:22:20;01:22:22;"Indie feel?"
01:22:22;01:22:26;"Like he's country and I know people really connect with his songs"
01:22:26;01:22:28;"And I'm excited to get deeper into his songs"
01:22:28;01:22:31;"But the vibe of the music"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"Reminds me a lot of like"
01:22:33;01:22:34;"Lumineers"
01:22:34;01:22:35;"Even a little bit of Mumford"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"And the Lumineers are on this record"
01:22:37;01:22:39;"And they're just getting this like"
01:22:39;01:22:43;"The Heiden article was referencing"
01:22:43;01:22:46;"Dashboard Conventional and Bright Eyes"
01:22:46;01:22:47;"And I was like"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"Maybe I will steer clear of this one"
01:22:49;01:22:50;"No, look, someone"
01:22:50;01:22:52;"And I just saw a recent tweet"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"That some Instagram post's manager"
01:22:54;01:22:56;"Put up a tweet saying"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"Yeah this reminds me of Bright Eyes"
01:22:58;01:23:00;"I think it might only be emotional"
01:23:00;01:23:02;"Like on some emotional chord"
01:23:02;01:23:05;"Because this one is so much about breakups"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"And there's a lot of"
01:23:06;01:23:07;"I love the album cover"
01:23:07;01:23:08;"Oh it's a great album cover"
01:23:08;01:23:09;"Look at that jaw"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"Is that the end of the song?"
01:23:11;01:23:12;"No I stopped it"
01:23:12;01:23:13;"Oh"
01:23:13;01:23:14;"It sounds nice"
01:23:14;01:23:15;"We're not really listening"
01:23:15;01:23:16;"No it's pretty but"
01:23:16;01:23:17;"I just"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"And I could see getting deeper"
01:23:19;01:23:20;"Like a song like that"
01:23:20;01:23:22;"You gotta get into the lyrics"
01:23:22;01:23:23;"And that's how you're gonna judge"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"You know if you really connect with it"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"But does he have any just like"
01:23:27;01:23:28;"Like a pedal steal"
01:23:28;01:23:29;"Or like a really like"
01:23:29;01:23:30;"Bam bam bam"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"Like a nice country band"
01:23:32;01:23:33;"Like Cracker Jack"
01:23:33;01:23:34;"Yeah absolutely"
01:23:34;01:23:35;"Kenny Budget"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"He had a lot of pedal steal there"
01:23:37;01:23:38;"He's got a fiddler player up with him"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"I want a Kenny Butchery shuffle"
01:23:40;01:23:41;"Let me just think"
01:23:41;01:23:42;"Because you're right"
01:23:42;01:23:43;"Everything I heard is ballady"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"And I'm like"
01:23:44;01:23:45;"I'm not"
01:23:45;01:23:46;"That's not"
01:23:46;01:23:47;"I mean"
01:23:47;01:23:48;"That's tough for me"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"Try this motorcycle drive by"
01:23:50;01:23:52;"I wonder if this one is like"
01:23:52;01:23:53;"Upbeat enough for you"
01:23:53;01:23:55;"One two three four"
01:23:55;01:23:56;"One two"
01:23:57;01:24:00;"(guitar solo)"
01:24:00;01:24:13;"It's a motorcycle drive by"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"Baby drive it kind of"
01:24:15;01:24:18;"I think it's about time we headed home"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"Sounds like Ed Sheeran"
01:24:20;01:24:21;"That vocal delivery is super"
01:24:21;01:24:23;"Not the X-Men"
01:24:23;01:24:26;"Country boys don't die alone"
01:24:26;01:24:29;"(guitar solo)"
01:24:29;01:24:35;"As I told you I've never been to a show"
01:24:35;01:24:36;"We were talking about it"
01:24:36;01:24:38;"Obviously I think the Taylor Swift show"
01:24:38;01:24:40;"Probably has the same thing"
01:24:40;01:24:42;"But where every person knows every word"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"To every song"
01:24:44;01:24:45;"That's cool"
01:24:45;01:24:46;"And it's you know"
01:24:46;01:24:48;"He's playing at Crypto or T-Mobile Arena"
01:24:48;01:24:50;"17, 20,000 people"
01:24:50;01:24:51;"And I'm talking about"
01:24:51;01:24:52;"What an ascent"
01:24:52;01:24:53;"Pretty wild"
01:24:53;01:24:54;"Yeah"
01:24:54;01:24:55;"Yeah good for him"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"27 years old"
01:24:56;01:24:57;"And is it a"
01:24:57;01:24:58;"Okay so even with that song though"
01:24:58;01:24:59;"I can see"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"Maybe I'm getting like a fuller picture"
01:25:01;01:25:02;"That it's always"
01:25:02;01:25:04;"Like the chords are always kind of like"
01:25:04;01:25:05;"Emotional"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"Yeah that was D, A, B minor, G"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"(sings)"
01:25:09;01:25:10;"Yeah those are kind of like"
01:25:10;01:25:12;"Emo pop punk chords a bit"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"So okay and I can see how"
01:25:13;01:25:15;"You know he's clearly got"
01:25:15;01:25:16;"Away with words"
01:25:16;01:25:17;"People connect with him"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"There's not too much like"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"Bluesy shuffle type country"
01:25:21;01:25:22;"I mean no"
01:25:22;01:25:24;"I mean obviously this guy wears his heart on his sleeve"
01:25:24;01:25:25;"It's emotional music"
01:25:25;01:25:28;"Well you know that article I think was Stereo Gummets"
01:25:28;01:25:29;"Does he have fun songs?"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"Yeah he has fun songs"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"I guess it's because with the"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"(sings)"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"With the Springsteen comparison"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"You know to me the Springsteen thing is that"
01:25:39;01:25:40;"He gets emo"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"But then there's gotta be some like"
01:25:42;01:25:43;"Some like fun"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"Yeah"
01:25:44;01:25:45;"Oh yeah"
01:25:45;01:25:46;"Alright"
01:25:46;01:25:47;"You know"
01:25:47;01:25:48;"There are definitely fun songs"
01:25:48;01:25:49;"Yeah"
01:25:49;01:25:50;"But there's something"
01:25:50;01:25:51;"That maybe speaks to the"
01:25:51;01:25:52;"You know"
01:25:52;01:25:53;"Like the current emotional state"
01:25:53;01:25:54;"That there's a just"
01:25:54;01:25:55;"It's a"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"It's like a bloodletting"
01:25:56;01:25:57;"At these shows"
01:25:57;01:25:58;"It's just a lot of"
01:25:58;01:25:59;"Dudes"
01:25:59;01:26:00;"Very em"
01:26:00;01:26:01;"Crying"
01:26:01;01:26:02;"Yeah crying and screaming the song"
01:26:02;01:26:03;"So when I say"
01:26:03;01:26:06;"It's an incredible kind of experience"
01:26:06;01:26:08;"What is it that is"
01:26:08;01:26:09;"Is connecting so quickly"
01:26:09;01:26:10;"With huge audiences"
01:26:10;01:26:11;"Is it like there's a"
01:26:11;01:26:13;"Like it doesn't have that sort of"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"Phony Nashville like"
01:26:15;01:26:16;"No"
01:26:16;01:26:17;"Thing is that"
01:26:17;01:26:18;"That's definitely part of it"
01:26:18;01:26:19;"Right"
01:26:19;01:26:20;"I think that there's"
01:26:20;01:26:23;"A very specific kind of songwriting that"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"And storytelling that"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"There's a history of country music"
01:26:27;01:26:28;"You know"
01:26:28;01:26:29;"That does this but not"
01:26:29;01:26:30;"Current country music really"
01:26:30;01:26:32;"And there's"
01:26:32;01:26:35;"That Stereogum article that I was talking to you about"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"Where it's comparing him to Jackson Maine"
01:26:37;01:26:38;"You know"
01:26:38;01:26:39;"Oh right"
01:26:39;01:26:40;"There's not really another equivalent"
01:26:40;01:26:41;"Like it doesn't really"
01:26:41;01:26:42;"There's a handful of like"
01:26:42;01:26:43;"Maybe alt country people"
01:26:43;01:26:44;"Everything you're saying"
01:26:44;01:26:46;"It feels so much closer to like"
01:26:46;01:26:47;"The Bright Eyes world"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"Of connecting so deeply"
01:26:49;01:26:50;"With like an emotional"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"Singer songwriter"
01:26:52;01:26:53;"Heart on your sleeve"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"Getting like deep raw feelings"
01:26:55;01:26:56;"And there's a lot of guys that are revered"
01:26:56;01:26:58;"Like Jason Isbell for instance"
01:26:58;01:26:59;"That are revered in that world"
01:26:59;01:27:00;"Keep it closer"
01:27:00;01:27:01;"Yeah"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"Zach Bryan has ascended so far beyond that"
01:27:03;01:27:04;"In terms of popularity"
01:27:04;01:27:05;"I'm just sort of"
01:27:05;01:27:07;"I think that there's a certain amount of the song"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"And I really like Jason Isbell too"
01:27:09;01:27:10;"Sure"
01:27:10;01:27:11;"But you know there's"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"He's definitely connecting on like"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"A very like working class"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"Was in the Navy"
01:27:17;01:27:18;"And storytelling"
01:27:18;01:27:19;"I"
01:27:19;01:27:22;"And there's also an anthemic part"
01:27:22;01:27:24;"You know to the sound too"
01:27:24;01:27:26;"And maybe it's like slightly like less"
01:27:26;01:27:28;"It's really smart music I think"
01:27:28;01:27:29;"But it's maybe like less intellectual"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Than even like Jason Isbell or something"
01:27:31;01:27:32;"It's just"
01:27:32;01:27:33;"It's more immediately"
01:27:33;01:27:34;"Connective"
01:27:34;01:27:35;"And it is"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"The other thing that I found very interesting about"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"And I went to two shows in a row"
01:27:39;01:27:40;"I went to Vegas"
01:27:40;01:27:42;"And then to the LA show"
01:27:42;01:27:43;"God you're ahead man"
01:27:43;01:27:44;"I'm"
01:27:44;01:27:45;"I got"
01:27:45;01:27:46;"I do have like a fever"
01:27:46;01:27:47;"And this is another thing"
01:27:47;01:27:48;"Have you been this excited about an artist"
01:27:48;01:27:49;"In the last five years?"
01:27:49;01:27:50;"Outside of Kanye?"
01:27:50;01:27:51;"No"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"And maybe when Little Peep started"
01:27:53;01:27:54;"And when Tyler started"
01:27:54;01:27:55;"And I was like"
01:27:55;01:27:56;"He's already huge"
01:27:56;01:27:57;"And the thing is"
01:27:57;01:27:58;"He maybe hasn't had a song yet"
01:27:58;01:28:00;"That everybody knows"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"But what"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"I think what often happens with these"
01:28:03;01:28:04;"Types of characters"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"They hit a certain group of people"
01:28:06;01:28:07;"So hard immediately"
01:28:07;01:28:08;"Maybe Lana Del Rey is"
01:28:08;01:28:09;"Kind of like the same thing"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"And then just like eventually"
01:28:11;01:28:12;"It's so big"
01:28:12;01:28:13;"It resonates so hard with people"
01:28:13;01:28:16;"And some of it is just atmosphere and vibe"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"And then eventually"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"They make that"
01:28:19;01:28:20;"You know"
01:28:20;01:28:21;"Album of the year type album"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"That like the critics go nuts"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"Maybe this is his album"
01:28:25;01:28:26;"I actually don't know"
01:28:26;01:28:27;"But you know what I mean"
01:28:27;01:28:28;"It's like they start out"
01:28:28;01:28:29;"It's resonating with people"
01:28:29;01:28:30;"And some people are like"
01:28:30;01:28:31;"Oh it seems cool"
01:28:31;01:28:32;"But I haven't found my way in yet"
01:28:32;01:28:33;"They almost always"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"Produce that album eventually"
01:28:35;01:28:36;"Or that song"
01:28:36;01:28:37;"He did this thing"
01:28:37;01:28:38;"That maybe you can help me"
01:28:38;01:28:39;"Sort of understand a bit more"
01:28:39;01:28:40;"Because I've never heard of anyone"
01:28:40;01:28:42;"In the music business doing this"
01:28:42;01:28:43;"And he definitely"
01:28:43;01:28:44;"His sort of"
01:28:44;01:28:46;"His own PR statement"
01:28:46;01:28:47;"Was that he"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"There was no real roll out with this"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"But he's in the middle of touring"
01:28:50;01:28:52;"Another album"
01:28:52;01:28:54;"And he released this album"
01:28:54;01:28:56;"And he plays no songs"
01:28:56;01:28:58;"From this album at all"
01:28:58;01:28:59;"During the whole tour"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"So there was no real announcement"
01:29:01;01:29:02;"He was doing it"
01:29:02;01:29:03;"But he releases this huge album"
01:29:03;01:29:04;"In the middle of another tour"
01:29:04;01:29:06;"So he's also just very prolific"
01:29:06;01:29:07;"Yeah"
01:29:07;01:29:08;"He's got that in common"
01:29:08;01:29:09;"With our next artist"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"Taylor Swift"
01:29:10;01:29:11;"Number four"
01:29:11;01:29:13;"Another classic country artist"
01:29:13;01:29:21;"Off the 1989 album"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"2015"
01:29:23;01:29:27;"How often do you think"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar talk?"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"In person, not often, on text?"
01:29:31;01:29:34;"Daily"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"Do you think Kendrick Lamar"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"Sent her a congrats on the tour"
01:29:38;01:29:40;"Gift basket?"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"I don't know enough about Kendrick's style"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"I'm gonna guess no"
01:29:45;01:29:46;"But who knows"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"His gift giving style?"
01:29:48;01:29:49;"Yeah, like his personality"
01:29:49;01:29:50;"Is that something he would do?"
01:29:50;01:29:51;"I don't know"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"I'm sure he does it for some people"
01:29:53;01:29:55;"Oh, Kendrick Lamar"
01:29:55;01:29:56;"In May was at"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"Taylor Swift's star studded party"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"At Electric Lady Studios in New York"
01:30:00;01:30:03;"Does that do anything?"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"No, that's just like"
01:30:05;01:30:07;"Kind of industry stuff"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"I'm talking about an unsolicited"
01:30:09;01:30:12;"Gift or text from Kendrick to Taylor"
01:30:12;01:30:14;"Or vice versa"
01:30:14;01:30:16;"They're both at the top of their fields"
01:30:16;01:30:17;"So at a certain point"
01:30:17;01:30:19;"They have to just kind of"
01:30:19;01:30:20;"Yeah, recognize each other"
01:30:20;01:30:21;"Game recognize game"
01:30:21;01:30:22;"You know, it's the same"
01:30:22;01:30:23;"Like, you know"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"I'm sure that"
01:30:24;01:30:26;"You don't know exactly why"
01:30:26;01:30:27;"But I'm sure"
01:30:27;01:30:29;"You know, the CEO of Nike"
01:30:29;01:30:31;"Checks in with the CEO of Starbucks"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"At least once a year"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"You think?"
01:30:35;01:30:36;"Yeah"
01:30:36;01:30:38;"Or they run into each other in Aspen"
01:30:38;01:30:39;"Or something"
01:30:39;01:30:40;"It's just kind of like"
01:30:40;01:30:41;"How the hell are you?"
01:30:41;01:30:42;"Yeah, friend of the show"
01:30:42;01:30:43;"Gerard Carmichael"
01:30:43;01:30:45;"Was also at the studio"
01:30:45;01:30:46;"Oh, that's cool"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"The number four song this week"
01:30:48;01:30:50;"""Gonna F*** You Mean"""
01:30:50;01:30:52;"We heard this last week"
01:30:52;01:30:53;"Yeah, we heard this last week"
01:30:53;01:30:54;"Spooky"
01:30:54;01:30:56;"Spooky beat"
01:30:56;01:30:58;"Alright, we're not gonna have anything to say about this"
01:30:58;01:30:59;"Number three song"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"This week in 2015"
01:31:01;01:31:04;"Remember this one?"
01:31:04;01:31:07;"""Silento"""
01:31:07;01:31:08;"Maybe"
01:31:08;01:31:13;"This is a dance song"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"You can follow what he says"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"Oh yeah"
01:31:17;01:31:18;"Watch me nae nae"
01:31:18;01:31:20;"Remember famously"
01:31:20;01:31:23;"Hillary Clinton whipped a nae nae"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"Her way right out of the race"
01:31:25;01:31:29;"Wait, so that's from this song?"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"Well, he didn't"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"I don't think he invented the dance moves"
01:31:33;01:31:36;"But he certainly popularized them with this song"
01:31:36;01:31:38;"He also said ""Pokemon Go to the polls"""
01:31:38;01:31:39;"Do you remember that?"
01:31:39;01:31:40;"Oh yeah, legendary"
01:31:40;01:31:43;"I've heard that reference"
01:31:43;01:31:44;"I still say it"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"It's a cursed conversation"
01:31:46;01:31:49;"Yeah, nobody wants to hear about that"
01:31:49;01:31:51;"But for real"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"You should ""Pokemon Go to the polls"""
01:31:53;01:31:55;"Next time there's an election"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"Just do it"
01:31:57;01:31:58;"Come on guys"
01:31:58;01:31:59;"Jokes aside"

01:32:01;01:32:04;"We gotta keep moving"
01:32:04;01:32:05;"The number three song"
01:32:05;01:32:06;"I mean, again"
01:32:06;01:32:08;"Do we really have time to talk about this?"
01:32:08;01:32:09;"We might have to do an all"
01:32:09;01:32:10;"Let's do this"
01:32:10;01:32:11;"I haven't even heard this song"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"So the number three song"
01:32:13;01:32:14;"I don't wanna hear this f***ing damn song"
01:32:14;01:32:15;"He doesn't wanna do it"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"It's not that I don't wanna do it"
01:32:17;01:32:18;"Okay, we're just gonna"
01:32:18;01:32:19;"We're fine"
01:32:19;01:32:20;"Let's give this some real time"
01:32:20;01:32:22;"We'll give this some real time"
01:32:22;01:32:23;"Finally"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"The biggest hit of the last few weeks"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"We're finally ready to talk about it"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"Oliver Anthony"
01:32:29;01:32:32;"Although his artist name is Oliver Anthony Music Everywhere"
01:32:32;01:32:33;"I love that"
01:32:33;01:32:36;"Some like Myspace social media stuff"
01:32:36;01:32:38;"Just like the first artist"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"Who just kinda never even gets their own name"
01:32:40;01:32:43;"Just Oliver Anthony Productions"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"Oliver Anthony Music LLC"

01:33:09;01:33:11;"Working all day"
01:33:11;01:33:14;"So this song did go to number one on the Billboard, right?"
01:33:14;01:33:15;"Yeah"
01:33:15;01:33:16;"Hot 100"
01:33:16;01:33:19;"I believe he's the first artist ever to"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"Go to number one on the Billboard"
01:33:21;01:33:24;"Without having ever had released any other music before"
01:33:24;01:33:27;"What the world's gotten to"

01:33:31;01:33:32;"Wish I could just wake up"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"This is your first time hearing this, Jake?"
01:33:34;01:33:35;"In its entirety, yes"
01:33:35;01:33:36;"But it is"
01:33:36;01:33:38;"Oh, it is"
01:33:38;01:33:42;"Living in the new world"

01:33:46;01:33:49;"He's from Farmville, Virginia"
01:33:49;01:33:50;"Sounds made up"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"Maybe he is an industry plant"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"That's weird"
01:33:54;01:33:56;"What's your name, son?"

01:34:04;01:34:06;"Where are you from?"
01:34:06;01:34:08;"Farm- Farmville?"
01:34:08;01:34:12;"Wait, isn't Farmville a game people play on Facebook?"
01:34:12;01:34:13;"Wait, it is, right?"
01:34:13;01:34:14;"Yes"
01:34:14;01:34:15;"Like the Sims"
01:34:15;01:34:16;"It's literally called Farmville?"
01:34:16;01:34:17;"Hang on"
01:34:17;01:34:19;"I'm pretty sure"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"Yeah, Farmville"
01:34:21;01:34:23;"My name's Oliver Anthony Music, sir"
01:34:23;01:34:24;"I'm from Facebook, Tennessee"
01:34:24;01:34:26;"And I just really want to sing country music"
01:34:26;01:34:28;"Ain't got folks in the street"
01:34:28;01:34:30;"Ain't got nothing to eat"
01:34:30;01:34:33;"And the old beast, milk and welfare"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"Come on, people, it's South"
01:34:35;01:34:37;"It's South, man"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"Taxes ought not to pay"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"For your bags of five-drowned"
01:34:41;01:34:42;"Okay, this is the big line, Jake"
01:34:42;01:34:44;"Let's make sure that you hear this"
01:34:44;01:34:45;"I missed that"
01:34:45;01:34:47;"Look out for miners"
01:34:47;01:34:48;"And not just miners"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"On an island somewhere"
01:34:50;01:34:53;"Lord, we got folks in the street"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"Ain't got nothing to eat"
01:34:55;01:34:58;"And the old beast, milk and welfare"
01:34:58;01:34:59;"The old beast"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"God, if you're five foot three"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"And you're three hundred pounds"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"Taxes ought not to pay"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"For your bags of five-drowned"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"Young men are putting American idiots"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"In the last man"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"'Cause all this damn country does"
01:35:13;01:35:16;"Is keep on kicking them down"
01:35:16;01:35:18;"Lord, it's a damn shame"
01:35:18;01:35:21;"What the world's gotten to"
01:35:21;01:35:23;"For people like me"
01:35:23;01:35:24;"For people like you"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"Wish I could just wake up"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"And it not be true"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"But it is"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"It's a damn shame"
01:35:32;01:35:35;"Living in the new world"
01:35:35;01:35:38;"With the whole soul"
01:35:38;01:35:40;"With the whole soul"
01:35:40;01:35:42;"The rich man told the rich"
01:35:42;01:35:47;"To roll with the total control"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"Wanna know what you think"
01:35:49;01:35:51;"Wanna know what you do"
01:35:51;01:35:53;"And they don't think you know"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"But I know that you do"
01:35:55;01:35:58;"You think this is just recorded live to Pro Tools file?"
01:35:58;01:36:01;"There's a video that made it look like it's live"
01:36:01;01:36:02;"Who knows?"
01:36:02;01:36:03;"No over, it's just"
01:36:03;01:36:06;"Who knows? He could be punching in lines"
01:36:07;01:36:20;"[Guitar playing]"
01:36:20;01:36:23;"I've been selling my soul"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"Working all day"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"Overtime hours"
01:36:27;01:36:30;"For bullish pay"
01:36:30;01:36:34;"Yeah, it is interesting"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"I mean, it's like, like that last line"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"Definitely there's some themes with"
01:36:38;01:36:40;"Resident with like Bruce Springsteen or something"
01:36:40;01:36:41;"Overtime hours"
01:36:41;01:36:44;"It is interesting to think about if Bruce had had a"
01:36:44;01:36:47;"Different kind of political valence"
01:36:47;01:36:50;"And had some random lines in Born in the USA about like"
01:36:50;01:36:51;"Welfare"
01:36:51;01:36:52;"Right"
01:36:52;01:36:53;"It's kind of fascinating"
01:36:53;01:36:57;"It's no surprise that this guy is a country guy"
01:36:57;01:36:58;"Right"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"And he's southern because"
01:37:00;01:37:05;"What even genre would a white working class guy from the north"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"Even operate in"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"If he was going to be a Bruce Springsteen of today"
01:37:09;01:37:12;"Because if a guy came out and he was doing Bruce Springsteen style rock and roll"
01:37:12;01:37:13;"It would be too contrived"
01:37:13;01:37:14;"Yeah"
01:37:14;01:37:17;"And if he was doing kind of like tasteful indie rock"
01:37:17;01:37:20;"If there is like a working class guy down the shore in Jersey"
01:37:20;01:37:21;"And he came out sounding like Big Thief"
01:37:21;01:37:24;"It also just wouldn't quite work"
01:37:24;01:37:26;"And then if he did country"
01:37:26;01:37:27;"He could do country"
01:37:27;01:37:28;"That's what he would do"
01:37:28;01:37:29;"Yeah"
01:37:29;01:37:31;"And it helps if you're actually southern"
01:37:31;01:37:34;"Bruce would have been doing country trap today"
01:37:34;01:37:35;"Down the shore"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"Well yeah so what ultimately"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"Maybe it's good that we're talking about this song now"
01:37:39;01:37:42;"Because it is a pretty good song"
01:37:42;01:37:43;"And he's got a pretty good voice"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"Seems like a passionate guy"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"I've found like maybe the whole"
01:37:47;01:37:48;"The hubbub around it annoying"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"Just because it's so predictable"
01:37:50;01:37:53;"If I had to summarize what I've seen"
01:37:53;01:37:56;"About this song and the story of this song"
01:37:56;01:37:57;"Which I haven't gone super deep"
01:37:57;01:37:59;"But this is just my you know"
01:37:59;01:38:00;"The little bits and pieces I've gotten"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"Guy comes out with this angry song"
01:38:02;01:38:03;"What's wrong with the world today?"
01:38:03;01:38:07;"He says a few slightly edgy provocative things"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"Although talking about Epstein is not"
01:38:09;01:38:10;"Is basically mainstream"
01:38:10;01:38:11;"People have been joking about Epstein"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"Didn't kill himself for years"
01:38:13;01:38:16;"So having this idea about the miners on an island"
01:38:16;01:38:17;"Okay"
01:38:17;01:38:18;"And that's also pretty apolitical"
01:38:18;01:38:19;"Yeah it's pretty"
01:38:19;01:38:20;"Yeah exactly"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"It definitely feels like it's more"
01:38:22;01:38:24;"Whatever QAnon adjacent"
01:38:24;01:38:25;"Outside of the Epstein stuff"
01:38:25;01:38:26;"Well I'd bet yeah"
01:38:26;01:38:27;"But here's the thing"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"So he comes out you know"
01:38:29;01:38:30;"And then he's talking about"
01:38:30;01:38:32;"Being anti-welfare definitely"
01:38:32;01:38:35;"We would say is pretty classically right wing"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"Not anti-welfare"
01:38:37;01:38:39;"He's anti"
01:38:39;01:38:40;"Obese people on welfare"
01:38:40;01:38:41;"Well just yeah"
01:38:41;01:38:43;"Yeah and I guess he could probably frame it as"
01:38:43;01:38:44;"I'm not anti-welfare"
01:38:44;01:38:46;"I'm just saying that the government"
01:38:46;01:38:48;"Should give people healthy food"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"And not give fat people fudge rounds"
01:38:50;01:38:52;"So he posted a fudge round"
01:38:52;01:38:53;"Yeah"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"On his Instagram"
01:38:55;01:38:57;"On his MySpace"
01:38:57;01:38:58;"And wrote"
01:38:58;01:39:00;"Our government likes to throw money at problems"
01:39:00;01:39:02;"Without conceptualizing real solutions"
01:39:02;01:39:04;"That connect the individuals involved"
01:39:04;01:39:07;"The lyrics contrast that some are left without any"
01:39:07;01:39:10;"And others are left with the option of living on junk food"
01:39:10;01:39:12;"Meanwhile our farming industry has been"
01:39:12;01:39:13;"Corporatized and sold out"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"Food is entirely too expensive"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"Especially in a nation with abundant farmland"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"In politics it's all about keeping people"
01:39:19;01:39:21;"Who are dependent dependent"
01:39:22;01:39:23;"It's hard to you know"
01:39:23;01:39:24;"That's a"
01:39:24;01:39:26;"Yeah and he tries to say that that's"
01:39:26;01:39:28;"Well so then the right wing"
01:39:28;01:39:30;"Because that is the right wing talking point right"
01:39:30;01:39:32;"Well he has later said"
01:39:32;01:39:34;"And has said that under no circumstances"
01:39:34;01:39:35;"Is this a right wing talking point"
01:39:35;01:39:36;"I know but that's what"
01:39:36;01:39:38;"No no but he's"
01:39:38;01:39:40;"Specifically addressed when the GOP"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"Talked about it and basically said like"
01:39:42;01:39:44;"Don't you know don't talk about me that way"
01:39:44;01:39:45;"I mean"
01:39:45;01:39:46;"Richmond North of Richmond is about"
01:39:46;01:39:48;"Corporate owned DC politicians on both sides"
01:39:48;01:39:49;"Though Biden's most certainly a problem"
01:39:49;01:39:51;"The lyrics aren't exclusively knocking Biden"
01:39:51;01:39:53;"It's bigger and broader than that"
01:39:53;01:39:54;"It's knocking the system collectively"
01:39:54;01:39:56;"Including corporate owned conservative politicians"
01:39:56;01:39:58;"Who were on stage that night"
01:39:58;01:39:59;"I mean that's pretty direct"
01:39:59;01:40:01;"Yeah but I think maybe that's why I find"
01:40:01;01:40:04;"This whole thing somewhat uninteresting"
01:40:04;01:40:05;"Is it's kind of like"
01:40:05;01:40:08;"Guy writes a song that essentially is saying"
01:40:08;01:40:09;"Things are so messed up"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"I'm angry things are messed up"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"Then one side of the political spectrum is like"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"Yeah exactly you're on our side"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"And then the other side you know"
01:40:17;01:40:19;"So just like you had right wingers being like"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"This guy's writing a right wing anthem"
01:40:21;01:40:22;"Or he's talking about how hard it is to be like"
01:40:22;01:40:23;"A working class white guy"
01:40:23;01:40:24;"You saw that"
01:40:24;01:40:27;"And then instantaneously like clockwork"
01:40:27;01:40:28;"So boring"
01:40:28;01:40:29;"You have people being like"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"No this guy's like a fascist"
01:40:31;01:40:34;"And actually he liked some 9/11 conspiracy videos"
01:40:34;01:40:36;"And he's QAnon and whatever"
01:40:36;01:40:38;"So you have these equally simple takes"
01:40:38;01:40:41;"That he's either a right wing hero"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"Or he's a QAnon nut job"
01:40:43;01:40:44;"And then he comes out and goes like"
01:40:44;01:40:46;"No guys I'm neither one of those things"
01:40:46;01:40:47;"I'm just"
01:40:47;01:40:48;"And I don't want to be taken"
01:40:48;01:40:50;"I'm just saying it's all messed up"
01:40:50;01:40:52;"And then my feeling is kind of like"
01:40:52;01:40:54;"Yeah cool"
01:40:54;01:40:55;"Anyway"
01:40:55;01:40:56;"You know what I mean"
01:40:56;01:40:57;"You wrote a song"
01:40:57;01:40:58;"I'm not dissing him"
01:40:58;01:41:00;"Like he's talented"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"And good for him for resonating with so many people"
01:41:02;01:41:03;"I just feel like"
01:41:03;01:41:06;"The story of the song makes an even more interesting point"
01:41:06;01:41:07;"Than the song itself"
01:41:07;01:41:10;"And it'll be interesting to see where he goes from here"
01:41:10;01:41:12;"Cause you know"
01:41:12;01:41:14;"The house always wins I guess is what I'm saying"
01:41:14;01:41:17;"I do like an artist getting into very specific"
01:41:17;01:41:20;"Policy arguments online"
01:41:20;01:41:21;"Yeah"
01:41:21;01:41:22;"I almost wish he would go"
01:41:22;01:41:24;"Really deep into food production"
01:41:24;01:41:25;"I wish he would go further down that road"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"Because I think"
01:41:27;01:41:30;"If you're not gonna deal with politics per se"
01:41:30;01:41:31;"You don't want to deal with political parties"
01:41:31;01:41:33;"As he clearly doesn't want to"
01:41:33;01:41:36;"Then you might as well get deep into specific policy"
01:41:36;01:41:37;"So if he follows this one up"
01:41:37;01:41:39;"With a song specifically"
01:41:39;01:41:42;"About like food policy and welfare"
01:41:42;01:41:44;"And say like"
01:41:44;01:41:45;"If he wrote one"
01:41:45;01:41:46;"He's like"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"Now when I was talking about fudge rounds"
01:41:48;01:41:49;"I'm not against dessert"
01:41:49;01:41:51;"Because if your feelings are hurt"
01:41:51;01:41:52;"And you want to get some"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"And he started going really deep"
01:41:54;01:41:55;"And just being like"
01:41:55;01:41:56;"All I'm saying is"
01:41:56;01:41:57;"When you use your"
01:41:57;01:41:59;"If you're part of the SNAP program"
01:41:59;01:42:01;"Then you should only have access"
01:42:01;01:42:03;"To healthy types of dessert"
01:42:03;01:42:04;"And I don't mean just fruit"
01:42:04;01:42:06;"But maybe some ice cream too"
01:42:06;01:42:07;"Cane sugar"
01:42:07;01:42:08;"Yeah cane sugar"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"None of this GMO corn-raised corn syrup"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"All of this GMO crap"
01:42:12;01:42:14;"You should get a Mexican Coke"
01:42:14;01:42:15;"And a"
01:42:15;01:42:16;"Jenny"
01:42:16;01:42:18;"Van Leeuwen ice cream"
01:42:18;01:42:19;"If you started getting into that"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"Alright man"
01:42:21;01:42:22;"I feel you"
01:42:22;01:42:23;"Yeah I mean"
01:42:23;01:42:24;"Neil Young did that"
01:42:24;01:42:26;"The album about Monsanto"
01:42:26;01:42:27;"If he just took that"
01:42:27;01:42:28;"Even one step further"
01:42:28;01:42:31;"And just started getting hyper technical"
01:42:31;01:42:33;"Then you got my interest, Oliver"
01:42:33;01:42:35;"Do we want to listen to his previous single"
01:42:35;01:42:37;"I've Got to Get Sober?"
01:42:37;01:42:38;"Wow"
01:42:38;01:42:39;"Just to see"
01:42:39;01:42:40;"It charted at"
01:42:40;01:42:42;"It charted on number 35"
01:42:42;01:42:43;"Previous?"
01:42:43;01:42:44;"I thought this was his first song"
01:42:44;01:42:45;"His previous single"
01:42:45;01:42:46;"Microblastic"
01:42:46;01:42:48;"Because he clearly"
01:42:48;01:42:49;"He didn't really want to get too political"
01:42:49;01:42:50;"With this single"
01:42:50;01:42:51;"Maybe"
01:42:51;01:42:52;"I've Got to Get Sober"
01:42:52;01:42:53;"Was actually the follow up song"
01:42:53;01:42:54;"But he's like"
01:42:54;01:42:56;"Richmond, North of Richmond"
01:42:56;01:42:57;"Boy was I drunk"
01:42:57;01:42:58;"I'm just trying to be a mainstream guy"
01:42:58;01:43:00;"Not ruffle any feathers"
01:43:00;01:43:01;"I'm not right, I'm not left"
01:43:01;01:43:02;"I'm right down the middle"
01:43:02;01:43:03;"Come on"
01:43:03;01:43:05;"I've Got to Get Sober"
01:43:05;01:43:06;"I really got to get sober"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"I must reiterate that I was very drunk"
01:43:10;01:43:13;"Track 3, seed oils"
01:43:13;01:43:14;"I mean he's"
01:43:14;01:43:15;"On his Wikipedia"
01:43:15;01:43:16;"It's like he's got like"
01:43:16;01:43:18;"He's got like 20"
01:43:18;01:43:20;"20 songs that came out before"
01:43:20;01:43:21;"Let's listen to I Get Sober"
01:43:21;01:43:22;"I've Got to Get Sober"
01:43:22;01:43:23;"He's bigger than this song"
01:43:23;01:43:24;"It sounds like"
01:43:24;01:43:25;"George Jones song, right?"
01:43:25;01:43:27;"Here we go"
01:43:27;01:43:29;"I just want a neo-country guy"
01:43:29;01:43:31;"Who rocks a little bit"
01:43:31;01:43:33;"Yeah, these guys are all such sad sacks"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"Zach Bryan is not a sad sack"
01:43:35;01:43:36;"He seems like a little bit of a"
01:43:36;01:43:38;"Nothing wrong with that"
01:43:38;01:43:42;"And the way we've been living"
01:43:42;01:43:48;"Just a song that we write till we die"
01:43:48;01:43:53;"Now some people write songs on living just right"
01:43:53;01:43:55;"But I write my own just to get by"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"I wonder what his speaking voice sounds like"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"Cause this is like a big thing that he's doing"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"I go on to win"
01:44:01;01:44:04;"Start writing the hymn"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"That sounds so sweet"
01:44:06;01:44:08;"A real appellation"
01:44:08;01:44:10;"It's like a civil war"
01:44:10;01:44:11;"I like this"
01:44:11;01:44:12;"I love this"
01:44:12;01:44:15;"And the scent of the world that we're in"
01:44:15;01:44:16;"Knock me back"
01:44:16;01:44:18;"He says a hint, he says ""howers"""
01:44:18;01:44:20;"Did you catch that in the last one?"
01:44:20;01:44:21;"It said ""hours"""
01:44:21;01:44:23;"I gotta get sober"
01:44:23;01:44:25;"Is it crickets?"
01:44:25;01:44:27;"Yeah, he records all of that stuff"
01:44:27;01:44:29;"Alright, I like his vibe"
01:44:29;01:44:33;"I think we need to go deep into the heart of the south"
01:44:33;01:44:37;"And find a young angry guy who served in the military"
01:44:37;01:44:39;"And is working class"
01:44:39;01:44:41;"But also likes to rock"
01:44:41;01:44:43;"We need like a good pick up band"
01:44:43;01:44:45;"He has a rollicking pick up band"
01:44:45;01:44:47;"And his first single, which we're gonna co-write with him"
01:44:47;01:44:48;"Is called ""Cheer Up Boys"""
01:44:48;01:44:50;"We gotta get these BPMs up"
01:44:50;01:44:51;"Bam bam"
01:44:51;01:44:53;"I'm gonna make you a high BPM"
01:44:53;01:44:54;"Cheer up boys!"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"I can't, I can't, this is killing me"
01:44:56;01:44:58;"Can there be like a"
01:44:58;01:44:59;"He's not a bummer"
01:44:59;01:45:01;"Can there be like a washboard player, like a guy at a jug?"
01:45:01;01:45:03;"Like a drinking bae?"
01:45:03;01:45:05;"Like a jug band?"
01:45:05;01:45:07;"A jug band"
01:45:07;01:45:08;"Industry plant, jug band"
01:45:08;01:45:11;"I'm telling you, I want active bass playing"
01:45:11;01:45:18;"I want some like really fun, sort of tasteful pedal steel fills coming in there"
01:45:18;01:45:19;"Banjo?"
01:45:19;01:45:21;"A guy on a telecaster"
01:45:21;01:45:23;"Maybe a fiddle?"
01:45:23;01:45:25;"I don't think I need a banjo"
01:45:25;01:45:28;"And the song is, he walks into a bar"
01:45:28;01:45:31;"Where everybody's listening to like Sad Sack"
01:45:31;01:45:32;"It can get kind of fun and meta"
01:45:32;01:45:35;"Then he puts on the very record that he's singing"
01:45:35;01:45:37;"He tells the DJ to put on my new song"
01:45:37;01:45:38;"It's called ""Cheer Up Boys"""
01:45:38;01:45:40;"And he gets everybody in the bar dancing"
01:45:40;01:45:41;"And he basically says"
01:45:41;01:45:43;"Hey, you can't trust any of these fools"
01:45:43;01:45:45;"Richmond, North of, Richmond"
01:45:45;01:45:46;"But hey, what are you gonna do?"
01:45:46;01:45:47;"We're going to hell in a handbasket"
01:45:47;01:45:48;"Cheer up boys"
01:45:48;01:45:49;"Cheer up boys, one, two, three, let's go"
01:45:49;01:45:51;"Cheer up boys drinks on me"
01:45:51;01:45:53;"In parentheses"
01:45:53;01:45:54;"In parentheses, drinks on me"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"His voice says, but I got to get sober"
01:45:56;01:45:59;"And he's like, you can party one more night with me"
01:45:59;01:46:03;"His ""I got to get sober"" parentheses, tomorrow"
01:46:03;01:46:04;"Yeah, tomorrow, yeah"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"And my buddy said, I got to get sober"
01:46:06;01:46:07;"And I said, yes you do"
01:46:07;01:46:08;"First thing tomorrow"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"The number two song"
01:46:10;01:46:13;"The week that Time Crisis premiered in 2015"
01:46:13;01:46:16;"I have not thought about this song in just about eight years"
01:46:16;01:46:17;"Cheerleader"
01:46:17;01:46:20;"When I need motivation"
01:46:20;01:46:23;"My one solution is my queen"
01:46:23;01:46:25;"'Cause she stay strong"
01:46:25;01:46:27;"Yeah, yeah"
01:46:27;01:46:30;"She is always in my corner right there"
01:46:30;01:46:31;"I'm feeling this"
01:46:31;01:46:33;"This is what I'm talking about"
01:46:33;01:46:34;"Cheer up boys"
01:46:34;01:46:37;"But I'm empty when you're gonna be sick"
01:46:37;01:46:39;"Do you need me?"
01:46:39;01:46:41;"Do you think I'm pretend?"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"Do I make you feel like you do?"
01:46:43;01:46:46;"Wasn't it a remix of this song that was like the big one?"
01:46:46;01:46:52;"Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader"
01:46:52;01:46:55;"This must have been on some early episodes"
01:46:55;01:46:56;"Yes"
01:46:56;01:47:01;"Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader"
01:47:01;01:47:04;"This is the one that was really big"
01:47:04;01:47:14;"Yeah, this sounds more familiar"
01:47:19;01:47:22;"When I need motivation"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"My one solution is my queen"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"'Cause she stay strong"
01:47:26;01:47:27;"Yeah, yeah"
01:47:27;01:47:30;"She is always in my corner right there"
01:47:30;01:47:31;"When I wanna"
01:47:31;01:47:33;"All these other girls are tempting"
01:47:33;01:47:35;"But I'm empty when you're gone"
01:47:35;01:47:36;"And they say"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"Do you need me?"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"Do you think I'm pretend?"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"Do I make you feel like you do?"

01:47:45;01:47:48;"Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader"
01:47:48;01:47:49;"This is good"
01:47:49;01:47:50;"Come on, bro"
01:47:50;01:47:51;"I like it, it feels good"
01:47:51;01:47:53;"This is bad call"
01:47:53;01:47:54;"Listen"
01:47:54;01:47:56;"What do I know? I mean, this was a hit"
01:47:56;01:47:57;"Yeah"
01:47:57;01:47:59;"The first version was so much sweeter"
01:47:59;01:48:00;"Yeah"
01:48:00;01:48:03;"She walks like a model"
01:48:03;01:48:05;"She grants my wishes like a dream"
01:48:05;01:48:06;"I think this is way faster, too"
01:48:06;01:48:07;"Yes"
01:48:07;01:48:11;"I actually, I'd love to hear all of Ranthony music cover this"
01:48:11;01:48:13;"And I got the magic wand"
01:48:13;01:48:15;"All these other girls are tempting"
01:48:15;01:48:17;"But I'm empty when you're gone"
01:48:17;01:48:18;"And they say"
01:48:18;01:48:19;"Do you need me?"
01:48:19;01:48:20;"I love the pre-chorus"
01:48:20;01:48:21;"Do you think I'm pretty?"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"Do you think I'm pretty?"
01:48:23;01:48:25;"I don't know about you, Ranthony"
01:48:25;01:48:27;"I like this guy is so polite where they said like"
01:48:27;01:48:29;"The other girls said to him"
01:48:29;01:48:30;"Do you need me?"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"Do you think I'm pretty?"
01:48:32;01:48:34;"Do I make you feel like cheating?"
01:48:34;01:48:37;"I say no, not really 'cause"
01:48:37;01:48:40;"It's just a sweet guy"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"No, not really"
01:48:42;01:48:46;"And also, yeah, who are these weird"
01:48:46;01:48:47;"These women saying"
01:48:47;01:48:49;"Do you feel like cheating?"
01:48:49;01:48:50;"Hey, can I ask you a question?"
01:48:50;01:48:51;"Do you think I'm pretty?"
01:48:51;01:48:52;"And it's like, uh"
01:48:52;01:48:53;"Sure"
01:48:53;01:48:54;"Sure, you're"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"Yeah, you seem like an attractive woman"
01:48:56;01:48:57;"Now we're getting somewhere"
01:48:58;01:48:59;"I like"
01:48:59;01:49:02;"Just this really aggressive female pickup artist"
01:49:02;01:49:05;"Just, if I can ask you a second question"
01:49:05;01:49:08;"Do I make you feel like cheating?"
01:49:08;01:49:11;"This guy's just like drinking like an orange juice with a straw"
01:49:11;01:49:13;"No, not really"
01:49:13;01:49:18;"I'm picturing she has like a free samples table at the grocery store"
01:49:18;01:49:20;"And she's just hitting up random guys"
01:49:20;01:49:22;"Just handing out little cups of smoothies"
01:49:22;01:49:23;"Yeah"
01:49:23;01:49:26;"Let me ask you something"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"Do you feel like cheating?"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"Uh"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"Do you like the smoothie?"
01:49:32;01:49:33;"Yes"
01:49:33;01:49:34;"Do you think I'm pretty?"
01:49:35;01:49:38;"Um, I suppose so"
01:49:38;01:49:40;"Do I make you feel like cheating?"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"Um, no, not really"
01:49:42;01:49:49;"It's a green flag, ladies"
01:49:49;01:49:53;"Um, no, not really"
01:49:53;01:50:04;"Some poor guy at the Costco"
01:50:04;01:50:06;"Do I make you feel like cheating?"
01:50:06;01:50:14;"No, not really"
01:50:14;01:50:17;"It's like sort of still a soft note"
01:50:17;01:50:19;"I can work with that"
01:50:19;01:50:20;"Door's still open"
01:50:20;01:50:23;"Um, not really"
01:50:23;01:50:26;"I don't know why it sounds so like sweet and nerdy to me"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"It's like Pee Wee Herman or something"
01:50:28;01:50:31;"Um, not really"
01:50:31;01:50:37;"This guy wants to say yes"
01:50:37;01:50:39;"But my wife's over there shopping for"
01:50:39;01:50:42;"Right"
01:50:42;01:50:45;"Do you have a business card or something you can hand me?"
01:50:45;01:50:51;"Make it fast, make it fast"
01:50:51;01:50:53;"Do you have like a QR code I can scan or something?"
01:50:53;01:50:54;"My wife comes over, so"
01:50:54;01:50:55;"Are samples any good?"
01:50:55;01:50:58;"What is this?"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"What's going on here?"
01:51:00;01:51:06;"I just gave your husband a smoothie sample and some coupons"
01:51:06;01:51:07;"He gets back from the supermarket"
01:51:07;01:51:10;"His wife's like, how was it?"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"Funny story"
01:51:12;01:51:14;"The woman giving out smoothie samples"
01:51:14;01:51:18;"Very flirtatious with me"
01:51:18;01:51:20;"Um, okay"
01:51:20;01:51:21;"Don't worry"
01:51:21;01:51:22;"What do you mean?"
01:51:22;01:51:23;"What did she say to you?"
01:51:23;01:51:25;"She asked if I thought she was pretty"
01:51:25;01:51:26;"Okay"
01:51:26;01:51:27;"And what did you say?"
01:51:27;01:51:29;"I said maybe"
01:51:29;01:51:30;"Wanted to be nice"
01:51:30;01:51:32;"I wanted to try to be nice"
01:51:32;01:51:33;"Then what?"
01:51:33;01:51:36;"She asked if I felt like cheating"
01:51:36;01:51:38;"We're doing this for the eighth time"
01:51:38;01:51:41;"To make you feel like cheating"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"What did you say?"
01:51:43;01:51:48;"I said no, not really"
01:51:48;01:51:49;"That's a feel good song"
01:51:49;01:51:50;"Yep"
01:51:50;01:51:53;"Look, with all due respect to the sad sack"
01:51:53;01:51:55;"Oliver Anthony music"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"Yes, there's a lot of suffering in this world"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"And of course in America"
01:51:59;01:52:01;"Just like anywhere"
01:52:01;01:52:03;"I just hope that we all remember"
01:52:03;01:52:06;"That the universe put these two songs together"
01:52:06;01:52:07;"In our top five"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"That we remember just 'cause"
01:52:09;01:52:11;"You might wake up with a Rich Man North of Richmond"
01:52:11;01:52:14;"Kind of day on your mind"
01:52:14;01:52:16;"You walk out, you're going to work"
01:52:16;01:52:18;"Stressed about money, all sorts of problems"
01:52:18;01:52:21;"You look over at your obese neighbors"
01:52:21;01:52:22;"Chomping on their fudge rounds"
01:52:22;01:52:25;"And you say, man, can't you use that welfare to eat something healthy?"
01:52:25;01:52:26;"You can't believe it"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"You listen to these politicians talk"
01:52:28;01:52:31;"Just, you know, you could also have a cheerleader moment later in the day"
01:52:31;01:52:33;"You know, that's the power of love"
01:52:33;01:52:35;"As bad as things get"
01:52:35;01:52:38;"As hard as those Rich Man North of Richmond screw us"
01:52:38;01:52:41;"Especially the most vulnerable among us"
01:52:41;01:52:43;"If you got a good woman"
01:52:43;01:52:44;"It's all you need"
01:52:44;01:52:46;"Good person"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"Whatever you're into"
01:52:48;01:52:50;"Paint the town red, Doja Cat"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"This week"
01:52:52;01:52:54;"Oh, I like this song"
01:52:54;01:52:55;"Oh, it's Samples Walk on By?"
01:52:55;01:52:56;"Jake, have you heard this?"
01:52:56;01:52:57;"I've not heard this"
01:52:57;01:53:01;"Walk on by"
01:53:01;01:53:06;"Walk on by"
01:53:06;01:53:09;"Yeah, yeah"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"I said what I said"
01:53:11;01:53:14;"I'd rather be famous instead"
01:53:14;01:53:16;"I let all that get to my head"
01:53:16;01:53:18;"I don't care, I paint the town red"
01:53:18;01:53:21;"I said what I said"
01:53:21;01:53:23;"I'd rather be famous instead"
01:53:23;01:53:25;"I let all that get to my head"
01:53:25;01:53:28;"I don't care, I paint the town red"
01:53:28;01:53:30;"Mmm, she the devil"
01:53:30;01:53:31;"She a bad lil'"
01:53:31;01:53:32;"She a rebel"
01:53:32;01:53:35;"She put her foot to the pedal"
01:53:35;01:53:37;"It'll take a whole life for me to settle"
01:53:37;01:53:39;"Mmm, she the devil"
01:53:39;01:53:41;"She a bad lil'"
01:53:41;01:53:42;"She a rebel"
01:53:42;01:53:44;"She put her foot to the pedal"
01:53:44;01:53:46;"It'll take a whole life for me to settle"
01:53:46;01:53:49;"Yeah, said my happiness is all of your misery"
01:53:49;01:53:52;"I put the gold in my kidneys"
01:53:52;01:53:54;"This small jug don't come with no jealousy"
01:53:54;01:53:57;"My illness don't come with no remedy"
01:53:57;01:53:59;"I am so much fun without Hennessy"
01:53:59;01:54:02;"They just want my love and my energy"
01:54:02;01:54:05;"A two second preview of the song was shared by Doja Cat"
01:54:05;01:54:08;"I feel like this is like a new way, like"
01:54:08;01:54:11;"recently the trend to preview new songs is like to drop like"
01:54:11;01:54:13;"You get them hyped off a two second snip"
01:54:13;01:54:16;"Right, like an almost like indecipherable"
01:54:16;01:54:18;"That's what Oliver Anthony Music did"
01:54:18;01:54:19;"He sent"
01:54:19;01:54:20;"Fudge rounds!"
01:54:22;01:54:24;"Everyone's like, what is this?"
01:54:24;01:54:26;"I gotta know more"
01:54:26;01:54:28;"Full song dropping next Tuesday"
01:54:28;01:54:32;"John Cougar Mellencamp tried that in 1984 with the"
01:54:32;01:54:34;"Chilly Dog!"
01:54:34;01:54:36;"But it was before the internet so it didn't really"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"Chilly Dog, Chilly Dog!"
01:54:38;01:54:40;"Didn't work"
01:54:40;01:54:42;"Great song from Doja Cat"
01:54:42;01:54:47;"The number one song the week that Time Crisis premiered in 2015"
01:54:47;01:54:48;"This is a classic"
01:54:48;01:54:51;"I remember listening to this a lot back then"
01:54:51;01:54:54;"Mmm"
01:54:54;01:55:01;"This would go off as like a sad emo country song"
01:55:01;01:55:03;"It's been a long day"
01:55:03;01:55:07;"I'm actually not kidding that Oliver Anthony Music could smash this"
01:55:07;01:55:08;"That'd be crazy"
01:55:08;01:55:12;"And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again"
01:55:12;01:55:16;"We've come a long way"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"From where we began"
01:55:18;01:55:20;"When his obese neighbor dies"
01:55:20;01:55:23;"He starts to feel a little bit like"
01:55:23;01:55:26;"God, was I too hard on that guy?"
01:55:26;01:55:31;"My song went viral and my neighbor was just like"
01:55:31;01:55:33;"Come on man"
01:55:33;01:55:35;"You know I struggle with my weight"
01:55:35;01:55:37;"I don't only eat fudge rounds"
01:55:37;01:55:39;"And also you're allowed to"
01:55:39;01:55:41;"I know we love to hit the road and laugh"
01:55:41;01:55:43;"But something told me that it wouldn't last"
01:55:43;01:55:44;"Had to switch up"
01:55:44;01:55:46;"Look at things different, see the bigger picture"
01:55:46;01:55:49;"Those were the days, hard work forever pays"
01:55:49;01:55:52;"Now I see you in a better place"
01:55:52;01:55:54;"Uh"
01:55:54;01:55:56;"How can we not talk about family"
01:55:56;01:55:58;"My family's all that we got"
01:55:58;01:55:59;"You know when you say you could cover this"
01:55:59;01:56:01;"It's sort of like Luke Combs"
01:56:01;01:56:03;"We never talked about Fast Car"
01:56:03;01:56:05;"That never charted while we did this"
01:56:05;01:56:06;"No we never did it"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"Then there was the country cover of Chasin' Chapman"
01:56:08;01:56:10;"So it'd be cool, you know"
01:56:10;01:56:13;"Wait, is this from a different song?"
01:56:14;01:56:15;"No, this is original"
01:56:15;01:56:16;"This is the hook and then it's like"
01:56:16;01:56:17;"Okay"
01:56:17;01:56:20;"Charlie, this is the first Charlie Puth hit"
01:56:20;01:56:22;"Before he became a prominent solo artist"
01:56:22;01:56:23;"Do you remember the name of"
01:56:23;01:56:24;"Rest in peace Paul Walker"
01:56:24;01:56:27;"Yeah, do you remember the name of Charlie Puth's fans?"
01:56:27;01:56:29;"Puthinators?"
01:56:29;01:56:30;"Yes!"
01:56:30;01:56:31;"Really?"
01:56:31;01:56:32;"The Puthinators"
01:56:32;01:56:33;"Yeah, we talked about it"
01:56:33;01:56:34;"I remember, I learned that on this show"
01:56:34;01:56:36;"That was deep in the recesses of my mind"
01:56:36;01:56:37;"Good one, yeah"
01:56:37;01:56:38;"Held on to that one"
01:56:38;01:56:41;"I thought it was the Puth and Reconciliation Committee"
01:56:42;01:56:43;"Yes"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"That's what the fan base is called"
01:56:45;01:56:46;"The individual ones are Puthinators"
01:56:46;01:56:47;"But the whole fan base is called"
01:56:47;01:56:48;"They belong"
01:56:48;01:56:50;"It's called the Puth and Reconciliation Committee"
01:56:50;01:56:52;"Okay, one thing I noticed"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"About the top five Billboard hits"
01:56:54;01:56:56;"Versus what we've been listening to now"
01:56:56;01:56:58;"In an interesting way"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"2015 is way more pop"
01:57:00;01:57:02;"Like everything we heard there is slick"
01:57:02;01:57:04;"Bad Blood was one of Taylor Swift's"
01:57:04;01:57:06;"Slickest, poppiest songs"
01:57:06;01:57:08;"Since then she kind of went her own"
01:57:08;01:57:11;"Kind of emo, folky thing"
01:57:11;01:57:13;"You know, if you compare the Fetty Wap to the Gunna"
01:57:13;01:57:16;"Fetty Wap is even kind of slick and fun"
01:57:16;01:57:18;"The Gunna's way kind of like darker"
01:57:18;01:57:20;"Summertime sadness"
01:57:20;01:57:23;"Yeah, we have some summertime sadness going on"
01:57:23;01:57:24;"And then of course"
01:57:24;01:57:26;"Zach Bryan, Oliver Music"
01:57:26;01:57:27;"You know, like"
01:57:27;01:57:28;"All jokes aside"
01:57:28;01:57:30;"You know, deep emotion"
01:57:30;01:57:32;"I maintain that I think"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"It's a million dollar idea"
01:57:34;01:57:37;"To have a Cheer Up Boys country star"
01:57:37;01:57:38;"But you know, you need all of it"
01:57:38;01:57:40;"And yeah, even the Doja Cat is weird"
01:57:40;01:57:41;"Doja Cat is weirder"
01:57:41;01:57:45;"So 2015 feels more pop, more slick"
01:57:45;01:57:47;"And nothing illustrates that better"
01:57:47;01:57:49;"Than comparing See You Again"
01:57:49;01:57:50;"An emotional song"
01:57:50;01:57:53;"But a very slick, mainstream emotional song"
01:57:53;01:57:55;"Compare that to the number one thing on"
01:57:55;01:57:58;"Apple Music right now"
01:57:58;01:57:59;"Zach Bryan"
01:57:59;01:58:00;"And this is pretty"
01:58:00;01:58:01;"I think this is somewhat unusual for"
01:58:01;01:58:03;"Country to dominate"
01:58:03;01:58:05;"The Apple Music charts like this"
01:58:05;01:58:06;"Like I said last time"
01:58:06;01:58:08;"We've always seen iTunes"
01:58:08;01:58:09;"Be dominated by country"
01:58:09;01:58:12;"But iTunes is an older crowd"
01:58:12;01:58:13;"Still buys MP3s"
01:58:13;01:58:14;"So that's why sometimes you get"
01:58:14;01:58:16;"Like the kind of QAnon"
01:58:16;01:58:19;"Trump January 6th choir type thing"
01:58:19;01:58:21;"So this is the number one song right now"
01:58:21;01:58:23;"Zach Bryan featuring Casey Musgraves"
01:58:23;01:58:25;"I Remember Everything"
01:58:25;01:58:28;"When I hear that phrase"
01:58:28;01:58:29;"I guess the first thing I think of"
01:58:29;01:58:31;"Doesn't he say that in Hurt?"
01:58:31;01:58:34;"But I remember everything"
01:58:38;01:58:39;"I like this side of Zach Bryan"
01:58:39;01:58:42;"I just want to hear his crazy songs"
01:58:42;01:58:50;"Rotgut whiskey's gonna ease my mind"
01:58:50;01:58:52;"What's rotgut whiskey?"
01:58:52;01:58:54;"Whiskey that rots your gut"
01:58:54;01:58:55;"Nasty"
01:58:55;01:58:56;"Yeah just real cheap"
01:58:56;01:58:57;"Nasty whiskey"
01:58:57;01:58:58;"Low"
01:58:58;01:58:59;"Wild turkey"
01:58:59;01:59:00;"Yeah bottom shelf"
01:59:00;01:59:03;"That'd be a good name for a song"
01:59:03;01:59:04;"Bottom shelf"
01:59:04;01:59:06;"Or an album"
01:59:06;01:59:07;"Bottom shelf"
01:59:07;01:59:08;"That's for our country guy"
01:59:08;01:59:10;"Who sings Cheer Up Boys"
01:59:10;01:59:12;"His album's called Bottom Shelf"
01:59:12;01:59:13;"Drinks are on him"
01:59:13;01:59:15;"But he's buying bottom shelf"
01:59:15;01:59:16;"And it's like"
01:59:16;01:59:17;"Face is all messed up"
01:59:17;01:59:18;"But he's smiling"
01:59:18;01:59:20;"Like laying at the bottom of the floor"
01:59:20;01:59:22;"Next to all the cheap s***"
01:59:22;01:59:26;"I'd sing you my love songs"
01:59:26;01:59:28;"And you'd tell me about"
01:59:28;01:59:34;"How your mama ran off in Ponderang"
01:59:35;01:59:39;"I remember, I remember everything"
01:59:39;01:59:45;"A cold shoulder, a closing time"
01:59:45;01:59:48;"You begging me to stay 'til the sun rose"
01:59:48;01:59:51;"Strange words come on out"
01:59:51;01:59:54;"Of an old man's mouth when his mind's broke"
01:59:54;01:59:57;"Pictures in past the time"
01:59:57;02:00:00;"You only smile like that when you're drinking"
02:00:00;02:00:02;"I wish I didn't remember"
02:00:02;02:00:04;"We've done 400 minutes"
02:00:04;02:00:05;"Remember"
02:00:05;02:00:07;"24,000 minutes of content"
02:00:07;02:00:09;"Wait, oh no"
02:00:09;02:00:10;"Is that what it is?"
02:00:10;02:00:11;"24,000"
02:00:11;02:00:12;"Oh no, 200 times 60"
02:00:12;02:00:15;"Sorry, 200 times 120"
02:00:15;02:00:16;"400 times 60"
02:00:16;02:00:18;"We've logged 24,000 minutes"
02:00:18;02:00:21;"You know, let's say we got"
02:00:21;02:00:22;"Let's say we got"
02:00:22;02:00:23;"So for our heads out there"
02:00:23;02:00:25;"Let's say we got 15 people who listen"
02:00:25;02:00:30;"That means we've logged over 360,000 minutes listened"
02:00:30;02:00:31;"Yeah"
02:00:31;02:00:32;"I mean the truth is"
02:00:32;02:00:33;"Those numbers don't sound bad"
02:00:34;02:00:35;"And the truth is we probably"
02:00:35;02:00:37;"I think we have more than 15 people who listen"
02:00:37;02:00:40;"So we've had millions of minutes listened"
02:00:40;02:00:42;"Of this program"
02:00:42;02:00:44;"But I remember you singing in that '88 Ford"
02:00:44;02:00:49;"A cold shoulder, a closing time"
02:00:49;02:00:52;"You were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose"
02:00:52;02:00:55;"Strange words come on out"
02:00:55;02:00:57;"Of an old man's mouth when his mind's broke"
02:00:57;02:00:58;"Congrats to Zach Bryan"
02:00:58;02:00:59;"Taking over the charts"
02:00:59;02:01:01;"I guess congrats to country music in general"
02:01:02;02:01:04;"Raw, new school country"
02:01:04;02:01:06;"Zach Bryan and Oliver Anthony music"
02:01:06;02:01:09;"That's three-fifths of the charts"
02:01:09;02:01:11;"I've always said this"
02:01:11;02:01:13;"Been making this joke for a long time"
02:01:13;02:01:15;"Back in the 90s you'd find a type of person"
02:01:15;02:01:17;"Who'd say I like everything except country and rap"
02:01:17;02:01:19;"And now"
02:01:19;02:01:22;"You can't find anybody who likes anything besides country and rap"
02:01:22;02:01:24;"Think about that"
02:01:24;02:01:27;"Lots changed since the 1990s"
02:01:27;02:01:29;"I like country and rap, nothing else"
02:01:30;02:01:32;"See you for episode 201"
02:01:32;02:01:33;"In two weeks"
02:01:33;02:01:36;"Thank you to Death Spot and Winter for coming through"
02:01:36;02:01:38;"And commemorating this with us"
02:01:38;02:01:40;"And thanks to everybody who's been listening"
02:01:40;02:01:42;"To the show"
02:01:42;02:01:44;"All these years"
02:01:44;02:01:46;"We'll see you next time, peace"
02:01:46;02:01:50;"Beach-style dress on the dry line"
02:01:50;02:01:56;"Do I remind you of your daddy in my '88 Ford?"
02:01:59;02:02:01;"A Labrador hanging out the passenger door"
02:02:01;02:02:03;"Time Crisis"
02:02:03;02:02:05;"With Ezra Koenig"
02:02:05;02:02:07;"(burps)"
