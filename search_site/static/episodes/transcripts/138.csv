00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis back again. The final show of 2020 is here. We're joined by longtime"
00:08;00:13;"friends of the show, Winter the Starbucking God and Rashida Jones."
00:13;00:20;"We'll be talking music, Starbucks and everything that happened in this eventful year."
00:21;00:30;"Long pause. This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:15;01:20;"Time Crisis back again. What's up, Jake?"
01:20;01:21;"The usual."
01:21;01:25;"Yeah, just painting, crushing burritos."
01:25;01:28;"Actually, I haven't really been doing burritos."
01:28;01:30;"Are burritos played out?"
01:30;01:37;"I think 2020 is my lowest burrito intake of any year in the last, I want to say, 20 years."
01:37;01:40;"Is that because of the COVID-19 pandemic?"
01:40;01:47;"I think it is. For whatever reason. I will get to go food, like pizzas and stuff occasionally."
01:47;01:56;"But for some reason, the burrito, sort of taqueria world, it hasn't been in my regular rotation the way it usually is."
01:56;01:58;"Even breakfast burritos?"
01:58;02:01;"Okay, well, I will do a breakfast burrito occasionally."
02:01;02:04;"I got a question for you. How many times in your life have you made a burrito?"
02:04;02:05;"Many."
02:05;02:06;"At home?"
02:06;02:08;"Oh, yeah. Hundreds."
02:08;02:09;"Oh, hundreds?"
02:09;02:10;"Sure."
02:10;02:12;"You've made hundreds of burritos?"
02:12;02:13;"Yeah. What about you?"
02:13;02:16;"A true burrito, I think possibly zero."
02:16;02:20;"You've never made a burrito? This is shocking."
02:20;02:28;"Kicking this episode off with a bang. Have I made a burrito? I've made quesadillas."
02:28;02:29;"Sure."
02:29;02:35;"I've made tacos. And I've certainly made all sorts of dumbass wraps."
02:35;02:46;"I can think of many times in my life where I grabbed some kind of random tortilla out of the fridge and put a slice of turkey,"
02:46;02:55;"some buffalo sauce, some sprouts, and maybe some shredded parmesan. I've made s*** like that."
02:55;02:57;"That's called a turkey burrito."
02:57;03:00;"Is it really a burrito if you don't fold it like a burrito?"
03:00;03:03;"If I make a burrito, sometimes I'll make a pot of beans."
03:03;03:04;"Yeah."
03:04;03:11;"And then that's sitting in the fridge for a few days. And maybe there's a Whole Foods rotisserie chicken. Or not."
03:11;03:16;"And then the burrito is sort of like the big tortilla. You put some beans in there, maybe some shredded chicken,"
03:16;03:22;"grate a little cheddar on there, maybe throw in an avo if you have it. That's the burrito, man."
03:22;03:24;"Right. But then do you fold the bottom?"
03:24;03:27;"Oh, yeah. You kind of put the ingredients mostly in the middle."
03:27;03:33;"And then you kind of give yourself a bottom fold so you're not losing enough bottom end."
03:33;03:35;"And then do you wrap it in tinfoil?"
03:35;03:37;"That would be..."
03:37;03:41;"[Laughter]"
03:41;03:46;"That'd be like in a weird period of your life. Just like single, years deep."
03:46;03:50;"Maybe that's like a version of your life where... I feel like I remember a long time ago."
03:50;03:58;"Could we have been driving somewhere or just chatting? And I just remember you talking about saying you thought it might be your destiny to one day live in the deep
desert."
03:58;04:00;"Does that ring a bell?"
04:00;04:01;"Yeah, absolutely."
04:01;04:10;"We might have also just been shooting the s***. Like, would you rather live in middle of nowhere, Arizona, trailer in a desert, or Alaska?"
04:10;04:14;"And I think I went with the cold spot and you were like, ""I'd do the desert."""
04:14;04:21;"But anyway, now I'm just picturing you like a different version of your life. Just like solo, painting, 20 miles from the nearest convenience store."
04:21;04:26;"Like we're like breaking bad trailer in the desert and just entertaining yourself by making burritos."
04:26;04:31;"And then just like wrapping in tinfoil and just be like, ""One rotisserie chick burrito for Jake."""
04:31;04:35;"Then you go to the other side of the table, grab it like, ""Thank you."""
04:35;04:38;"Like a weird desert version of Castaway."
04:38;04:42;"Yeah. Desert burrito."
04:42;04:45;"But anyway, your burrito consumption has plummeted this year."
04:45;04:46;"Yeah."
04:46;04:49;"Have you been painting just as much, if not more, in these troubled times?"
04:49;04:51;"I've been putting in big hours."
04:51;04:52;"Okay."
04:52;04:53;"Which has been great."
04:53;05:00;"Yeah, and I actually noticed that in that article about you that I did an interview for Seinfeld."
05:00;05:02;"Oh, yeah. With Caitlin."
05:02;05:05;"Yeah, shout out to Caitlin. What was it? Where was it published?"
05:05;05:07;"Inside Hook."
05:07;05:14;"Okay, shout out to Inside Hook. The Inside Hook profile, Jake, a clock that you said you're putting in 40-hour work weeks."
05:14;05:15;"Yeah."
05:15;05:17;"Is that like Monday through Friday, eight hours a day?"
05:17;05:26;"It's Monday through Friday, usually around like 10.30 or 11 to about 6, which is maybe 35 hours or something."
05:26;05:30;"And then usually a Saturday or a Sunday, I'll go in there for five hours."
05:30;05:35;"Especially nowadays, there's nothing going on socially or anything."
05:35;05:36;"So it's just sort of like..."
05:36;05:37;"Right."
05:37;05:42;"But I mean, even before COVID, I was always doing about 40 hours, 30 to 40 hours a week."
05:42;05:44;"Yeah, it's a very reasonable schedule."
05:44;05:46;"What's your schedule like with the recording?"
05:46;05:48;"I mean, it's so all over the place."
05:48;05:52;"I think compared to painting, there's very..."
05:52;06:00;"It's very rare that there's like a long stretch, no pun intended, of needing to diligently put hours in."
06:00;06:02;"Certainly we could be there for an eight-hour day."
06:02;06:08;"And I think, you know, as time's gone on, just like staying late has gotten less and less appealing."
06:08;06:09;"Yeah."
06:09;06:14;"Now, maybe being a little older, obviously I like to come see the family."
06:14;06:21;"But also, when you come straight home from like working, you're like super tired, go straight to sleep."
06:21;06:24;"It's nice to have like a couple hour buffer at least."
06:24;06:25;"So yeah, I don't know."
06:25;06:29;"We rarely have like a 40-hour work week until the very end."
06:29;06:35;"And I think, especially now, I kind of realize like, we've always been kind of like fits and starts style."
06:35;06:37;"There's not always something to do."
07:03;07:07;"Well, this is the last time crisis of the year."
07:07;07:09;"Can you believe it? We made it to the end of 2020."
07:09;07:10;"Weird."
07:10;07:15;"Yeah, I mean, what were you even talking about in January 20?"
07:15;07:17;"Seinfeld, can I get a number crunch?"
07:17;07:21;"What were some of the big topics of January 2020, TC?"
07:21;07:27;"All right. Well, we started the year with Amy Brown from Wendy's Twitter."
07:27;07:30;"Whoa, that feels like years ago."
07:30;07:33;"We talked about the Super Bowl when that was the thing."
07:33;07:35;"Who played in the Super Bowl this year?"
07:35;07:36;"I don't know."
07:36;07:37;"Good question."
07:37;07:39;"The Patriots?"
07:39;07:40;"Yeah."
07:40;07:41;"Vikings."
07:41;07:44;"No, no, no, no. It was the 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs."
07:44;07:45;"Oh, right."
07:45;07:47;"And Kansas City won."
07:47;07:49;"That does feel like it was five years ago."
07:49;07:50;"Right."
07:50;07:54;"Oh, the first appearance of the phrase, what about vampire man?"
07:54;07:56;"That was this year?"
07:56;07:57;"February."
07:57;08:02;"That was after the Grammys. What about vampire man?"
08:02;08:05;"Wait, what about vampire man?"
08:05;08:10;"Ferrara versus Ferrara and Butterfinger were all big topics."
08:10;08:11;"Oh, wow."
08:11;08:12;"That was this year?"
08:12;08:15;"Okay. That feels more recent."
08:15;08:16;"That was Q1."
08:16;08:25;"Well, our last IRL TC, our guest was Megan and Pearl from NJGov Twitter handle."
08:25;08:26;"Okay."
08:26;08:27;"Do you remember that?"
08:27;08:28;"Sure."
08:28;08:30;"That was a long time ago."
08:30;08:35;"Ezra, did Father of the Bride remind me what happened at the Grammys this year?"
08:35;08:37;"Did it win best alternative?"
08:37;08:39;"It won best alternative."
08:39;08:40;"Okay."
08:40;08:41;"But it lost."
08:41;08:42;"That's big."
08:42;08:43;"Thank you."
08:43;08:44;"I appreciate the congratulations."
08:44;08:46;"And if I could pay that forward for a second,"
08:46;08:54;"I want to congratulate the Kansas City Chiefs on their big win."
08:54;08:58;"Yeah, lost the rock song category and lost AOTY."
08:58;09:02;"But it's to Billie Eilish. Shout out to her."
09:02;09:06;"It is funny to think we did play some shows in this calendar year."
09:06;09:13;"We went to Iowa with Bernie and we played probably what was the last big music festival in the United States,"
09:13;09:15;"Okeechobee in Florida."
09:15;09:20;"That was that one final trip, a very cold night in Florida."
09:20;09:25;"I do vividly remember just like saying goodbye to everybody, some of the crew dudes."
09:25;09:30;"I remember me and Bayo were both the most wary of if we were ever going to play a show again,"
09:30;09:32;"because our next shows were going to be in South America."
09:32;09:33;"So there's a lot of like..."
09:33;09:36;"You knew it was your last show of the year?"
09:36;09:39;"No, no, no. It was a real question mark."
09:39;09:42;"So it was still a moment where you had very differing opinions."
09:42;09:45;"So we played the show saying goodbye to everybody."
09:45;09:51;"And some people were like, ""See you in South America,"" because that was in like two or three weeks from then."
09:51;09:55;"And I just kind of remember some people being like, ""Well, we'll see, man."""
09:55;09:59;"And they're like, ""Oh, come on. This is not that serious."""
09:59;10:02;"But in fact, every single show was canceled."
10:02;10:05;"So we've been doing quarantine TC for..."
10:05;10:07;"Nine months."
10:07;10:10;"Nine months. Well, we made it work."
10:10;10:11;"Kind of sucks."
10:11;10:13;"I want to say not only did we make it work,"
10:13;10:16;"I think that we found a rhythm and it thrived."
10:16;10:18;"Obviously, I want to see you guys."
10:18;10:23;"But I do think that we've figured out something that has been special."
10:23;10:25;"I don't know if it's special, but..."
10:25;10:29;"I think we're making do."
10:29;10:33;"I think IRL is going to be great to get back to."
10:33;10:37;"You know, I can't speak to the audio quality, but I do think in terms of the content,"
10:37;10:39;"we still had some good material this year."
10:39;10:42;"Even just looking back on the last few months,"
10:42;10:47;"I don't think I've ever gotten more messages from a TC interview than from Bob Weir."
10:47;10:48;"That was a good interview."
10:48;10:50;"And then, other side of the coin,"
10:50;10:53;"we had Garfield Eats, very controversial."
10:53;10:55;"Nathan Cummon and Hot, but you know what?"
10:55;10:57;"I think those are both classic interviews."
10:57;11:00;"And I just think they're two dudes at different moments in their life,"
11:00;11:01;"bringing different energy."
11:01;11:07;"Controversial within the listening community and within the TC family."
11:07;11:11;"I'm not going to say more,"
11:11;11:16;"but some people in this community are very pro-Nathan Marzian,"
11:16;11:18;"some are very anti."
11:18;11:20;"Listen, family doesn't agree on everything."
11:20;11:24;"But I do think on the TC thread, Nick put it well,"
11:24;11:30;"where he said, ""It's like when Jerry used to invite the Hells Angels to come hang and party at the Dead shows."""
11:30;11:32;"Some people would be like, ""These guys aren't hippies."
11:32;11:36;"They're bringing this harsh energy, bothering everybody."""
11:36;11:40;"And Jerry's vibe was kind of like, ""Listen, it's okay if people don't understand,"
11:40;11:43;"but my worldview is very nonjudgmental."
11:43;11:47;"They deserve to be here just as much as the peace, love, and hippies."""
11:47;11:49;"Garfield Eats is our Hells Angels."
11:49;11:53;"I wonder if the Dead kept the Hells Angels around after Ultimate."
11:53;11:55;"That would be the ultimate test."
11:55;11:56;"Right."
11:56;11:59;"When an organization is really getting some bad press,"
11:59;12:03;"do you maintain your ""everyone is welcome"" policy?"
12:03;12:06;"But anyway, I am pro having Nathan back."
12:06;12:12;"We have heard through The Grapevine that he has a new venture called Scooby Eats,"
12:12;12:15;"which is based on the Scooby-Doo IP."
12:15;12:20;"And I am legitimately curious about it because I'll tell you what,"
12:20;12:23;"I'd love to get Nathan back in."
12:23;12:25;"We're talking about this way too much."
12:25;12:27;"People are just like, ""Jesus Christ."""
12:27;12:30;"Somebody missed that episode and they're just listening to this, like,"
12:30;12:33;"just kind of meta commentary."
12:33;12:37;"But first of all, I don't think anybody should judge somebody based on,"
12:37;12:40;"you know, one 20-minute interview because, you know,"
12:40;12:44;"if any of us had to do a 20-minute interview in one of the stickiest situations"
12:44;12:47;"of our life, we might be coming in hot."
12:47;12:50;"So I'm very curious about what's up with Scooby Eats?"
12:50;12:53;"How is it different from Garfield Eats?"
12:53;12:55;"How is the pizza shaped?"
12:55;12:57;"And what has Nathan learned?"
12:57;13:01;"Because truly, adversity makes somebody stronger."
13:01;13:05;"And it wouldn't surprise me given on all the [bleep] he had to deal with"
13:05;13:09;"launching Garfield Eats if Scooby Eats is much more successful"
13:09;13:11;"because you learn from failure."
13:11;13:14;"I bet there's a lot of things he wouldn't do the same after realizing"
13:14;13:17;"just how hot the streets are in the restaurant business."
13:17;13:23;"Let's give him six months to get on his feet and then revisit."
13:23;13:25;"Okay, fair."
13:25;13:27;"But you heard it here, folks."
13:27;13:31;"In May 2021, we are going to reach out to Nathan Marzi."
13:31;13:33;"No, no, no, no, no."
13:33;13:34;"Not a guaranteed reach out."
13:34;13:37;"I meant revisit within the TC boardroom."
13:37;13:38;"We'll take a vote."
13:38;13:41;"Okay, well, the board of directors will convene."
13:41;13:42;"Yeah."
13:42;13:44;"And we'll discuss this."
13:44;13:46;"It would be a maverick move to have him back,"
13:46;13:49;"and I can imagine some of the more conservative members of the board"
13:49;13:51;"getting, like, you know, cold feet about it."
13:51;13:52;"Yep."
13:52;13:55;"Bob Iger wanted to buy Marvel, and people said,"
13:55;13:58;"""What do you want that for, a bunch of comic book characters?"
13:58;14:00;"What does that have to do with Disney?"
14:00;14:02;"We already got Mickey Mouse."
14:02;14:04;"What do we need Thor for?"
14:04;14:06;"Who's going to spend money to see a Thor movie?"""
14:06;14:09;"And, you know, the rest is history."
14:09;14:10;"But, yeah, we'll see."
14:10;14:11;"But here's the thing, Jake."
14:11;14:14;"I'm not going to just recommend having him back on the show."
14:14;14:18;"I'm going to force a vote to buy a majority stake of Scooby Eats."
14:18;14:21;"Hopefully Tim Cook's available for that board meeting."
14:21;14:28;"Time Crisis has purchased a controlling stake in Scooby Eats."
14:28;14:32;"Wall Street analysts consider the deal to be wildly overvalued."
14:32;14:34;"The TC stock is plummeting."
14:34;14:39;"And I'm just like, ""Listen, guys, things are going to stabilize."
14:39;14:40;"Things are going to stabilize."
14:40;14:41;"Trust the process."""
14:44;14:47;"If you want my love you gotta run with me"
14:47;14:51;"D-E-F-M four five six baby"
14:51;14:54;"Moving on is how I get my kicks"
14:54;14:58;"G-H-I-N-789 baby"
14:58;15:02;"I'll feel better at the next state line"
15:02;15:05;"Dennis Hopper, an Easy Rider"
15:05;15:09;"Jack Nicholson, an Easy Rider"
15:09;15:12;"Peter Ponda, an Easy Rider"
15:12;15:14;"Tell me who to let in love"
15:14;15:16;"Well, we got a big show today."
15:16;15:20;"As discussed last week, when we had Kazzy David on,"
15:20;15:23;"we're having two more members of the TC family."
15:23;15:26;"First, Winter, the king of starbucking."
15:26;15:29;"And second, Rashida Jones."
15:29;15:31;"But before we get to our illustrious guests,"
15:31;15:33;"I guess we got to talk about this KFC thing."
15:33;15:37;"I'll admit, I've been hesitant to talk about it because"
15:37;15:41;"I've been having a bit of like a philosophical crisis."
15:41;15:42;"I don't know if we ever got to the bottom of this,"
15:42;15:45;"but I feel like in the years we've been doing this show,"
15:45;15:49;"we've learned a lot about advertising and marketing."
15:49;15:51;"We've watched the way that social media and Twitter"
15:51;15:54;"has kind of changed the game for brands."
15:54;15:57;"We try to examine what these brands are doing to us."
15:57;15:59;"We met the people, you know,"
15:59;16:01;"we talked about Amy Brown from Wendy's,"
16:01;16:04;"and we talked to our boy from Steakums, of course, Pluckers."
16:04;16:07;"We've met a lot of social media managers for brands."
16:07;16:10;"We've tried to like understand the people behind this stuff,"
16:10;16:12;"but we have reached this point"
16:12;16:16;"where truly the people working marketing"
16:16;16:19;"and brand management for these companies,"
16:19;16:20;"they're just like us."
16:20;16:22;"There's no daylight anymore."
16:22;16:26;"They just do (beep) to make people like us talk about it."
16:26;16:28;"I feel like we've reached the brand singularity."
16:28;16:30;"Do you know what I mean, Jake, at all?"
16:30;16:32;"Like there used to be like space where it's like,"
16:32;16:34;"you know, like me and you could be sitting on a couch,"
16:34;16:35;"Beavis and Butthead style,"
16:35;16:39;"watch some dumb ass at and like talk and think about"
16:39;16:41;"what are they trying to do to us here?"
16:41;16:42;"Who made this?"
16:42;16:43;"Joke about it."
16:43;16:47;"But now it's like, we're all in the same swamp."
16:47;16:48;"It's almost like there used to be,"
16:48;16:51;"brands used to do things just to get attention"
16:51;16:52;"and everybody would kind of roll their eyes"
16:52;16:55;"and be like, yeah, swing and a miss."
16:55;16:56;"You wanted us to talk about it?"
16:56;16:58;"Well, guess what?"
16:58;17:00;"We are talking about it in a negative way."
17:00;17:02;"We're making fun of it."
17:02;17:03;"You know what I mean?"
17:03;17:05;"There used to be that kind of like distance."
17:05;17:09;"Whereas now it's like brands do straight up funny (beep)"
17:09;17:11;"It's almost Trump-esque in a way."
17:11;17:13;"Where it's like part of Trump's rise to power"
17:13;17:16;"was like realizing that laughing at him"
17:16;17:19;"and mocking him only made him stronger."
17:19;17:21;"You just go out there, do his standup routines,"
17:21;17:23;"say (beep)"
17:23;17:26;"and there's literally nothing that anybody could say"
17:26;17:28;"about him that he couldn't absorb"
17:28;17:32;"just to become more famous and arguably more powerful."
17:32;17:35;"And truly the thing that actually failed him"
17:35;17:40;"was not satire, was not people being irate about him."
17:40;17:42;"It kind of like took a virus to take this dude down."
17:42;17:46;"The human solution was very difficult in his case."
17:46;17:50;"So anyway, that leads us to the big topic of conversation"
17:50;17:53;"that KFC and Lifetime released a movie,"
17:53;17:55;"a recipe for seduction."
17:55;17:58;"A 15 minute mini movie starring Mario Lopez"
17:58;18:01;"as a sexy Colonel Sanders."
18:01;18:03;"And there's just something about this one"
18:03;18:07;"that to me truly is like the singularity of that."
18:07;18:09;"- Yeah, it's too on the nose."
18:09;18:12;"A lot of people tagged us on Twitter and Instagram"
18:12;18:16;"about this thing and it's just like, it's too TC."
18:16;18:18;"- Can I tell you about something I just read?"
18:18;18:22;"It's an article about this KFC Lifetime movie"
18:22;18:24;"and sort of the history of sponsored content"
18:24;18:28;"in this kind of branded content for TV"
18:28;18:30;"and you know, that they're doing."
18:30;18:32;"And they said, obviously this is something"
18:32;18:33;"people have been going for for a while"
18:33;18:36;"and they had a moment, but in talking about"
18:36;18:39;"how other brands have been trying to crack"
18:39;18:42;"the branded content, they say some efforts,"
18:42;18:43;"this is from Variety,"
18:43;18:46;"some efforts have been decidedly more creative."
18:46;18:51;"Arby's in 2014 released a 13 hour commercial"
18:51;18:53;"talking about how it smoked brisket."
18:53;18:56;"The marathon spot played out only on a local"
18:56;18:59;"my network affiliate in Duluth, Minnesota."
18:59;19:02;"But word of the stunt was enough to lure 350,000"
19:02;19:05;"unique visitors to watch the video on a website"
19:05;19:08;"where the average visit lasted 38 minutes."
19:08;19:11;"- Wow, that's like some Warhol movie."
19:11;19:14;"- Yeah, I'm pretty into that."
19:14;19:17;"- Static shot for 13 hours of slow roasting beef."
19:17;19:19;"- Yeah, I guess also, you know,"
19:19;19:21;"Warhol has his detractors too."
19:21;19:23;"There's probably somebody who's just like,"
19:23;19:25;"I get what you're doing here,"
19:25;19:27;"but this is not real art, sir."
19:27;19:28;"- I guarantee it."
19:28;19:30;"- Well, I know somebody must've felt that way,"
19:30;19:31;"but they're just like, you know what?"
19:31;19:36;"Because you, I know it's like, ha ha, seems cool, whatever."
19:36;19:39;"You're making Campbell's soup ads, you know,"
19:39;19:41;"Prince selling them back to like"
19:41;19:42;"rich Madison Avenue executives"
19:42;19:45;"who probably worked on the Campbell's soup campaign."
19:45;19:46;"But you know what?"
19:46;19:48;"This ends in one place, Mr. Warhol."
19:48;19:51;"This ends in a 14 hour Arby's commercial"
19:51;19:53;"on a Duluth affiliate."
19:53;19:55;"Like, I wonder if there's anybody who saw"
19:55;19:57;"like the full circle coming."
19:57;20:01;"But that said, I do think in a more positive way,"
20:01;20:05;"part of the TC ethos, slash Pluckers ethos,"
20:05;20:07;"is it's a dumb time to be alive."
20:07;20:10;"You play the hand you're dealt, try to have fun,"
20:10;20:12;"do your best to make the world a better place."
20:12;20:14;"But like, you know, I could kind of relate"
20:14;20:18;"to whoever was working at the Arby's ad agency back then."
20:18;20:21;"I would be pretty psyched if I ended up in advertising."
20:21;20:24;"Maybe it's just like the job I happen to get."
20:24;20:25;"And I actually convinced Arby's"
20:25;20:28;"to make a 14 hour commercial."
20:28;20:29;"Like, I would be very proud of myself."
20:29;20:31;"That person should be proud."
20:31;20:34;"Within your job, you did something cool and weird."
20:34;20:37;"You did make the world a vibier place."
20:37;20:38;"- I mean, like we joke about the like,"
20:38;20:40;"master grads who go into advertising,"
20:40;20:44;"but like, to me that sounds like someone has like an MFA"
20:44;20:47;"and is into like very long form, like minimalist art."
20:47;20:50;"Yeah, like the Warhol film of like a static shot"
20:50;20:53;"of the Empire State Building for 12 hours."
20:53;20:55;"I mean, I don't even know what the art, the ad was."
20:55;20:58;"I'm just picturing like the slow roasting pork."
20:58;21:01;"It reminds me in college, my friend Jason,"
21:01;21:02;"I played in a band with,"
21:02;21:05;"he got into making like weird minimalist films."
21:05;21:08;"We like went to Taco Bell and he like filmed me"
21:08;21:13;"and Adam Forkner eating Taco Bell, just like static shot."
21:13;21:14;"And then-"
21:14;21:16;"- We had to track that down."
21:16;21:19;"- Yeah, no, but like, there was like Saturday night movies,"
21:19;21:22;"like in like the big auditorium at my college, you know?"
21:22;21:25;"And like, Jason was involved in the programming"
21:25;21:27;"of the movies, but he would play his weird video art"
21:27;21:30;"before the movie as like a trailer."
21:30;21:32;"And there was one time there was screening, like,"
21:32;21:34;"I don't know, like ""Die Hard"" or something."
21:34;21:37;"And then it was like, the first five minutes was just me"
21:37;21:40;"and Adam eating Taco Bell, but then over it,"
21:40;21:42;"but this is the sick part, this is the sick part."
21:42;21:46;"Over it, he just dubbed over Pearl Jam, Jeremy."
21:46;21:47;"(laughing)"
21:47;21:50;"And it's just like, ""At home, straw and boob juice."""
21:50;21:50;"(laughing)"
21:50;21:53;"And it's just like me and Adam eating like seven layer"
21:53;21:56;"burritos at like a Taco Bell in Portland."
21:56;21:59;"And it's just like, that's it, no camera movement."
21:59;22:00;"That was the whole video."
22:00;22:03;"- Was there like weird murmuring in the audience"
22:03;22:05;"or people like confused?"
22:05;22:06;"- People hated."
22:06;22:09;"- Okay, so it's like the premiere of Stravinsky's"
22:09;22:11;"""Rites of Spring."""
22:11;22:13;"- Oh yeah, people were- - Audience get agitated."
22:13;22:15;"(laughing)"
22:15;22:19;"The Taco Bell, the Taco Bell riots at Lewis and Clark College."
22:19;22:23;"- I just love how aggressively minimal and nonsensical"
22:23;22:25;"(laughing)"
22:25;22:27;"that sort of video art was."
22:27;22:28;"- Did you ever see the Andy Warhol"
22:28;22:31;"Burger King Super Bowl commercial"
22:31;22:34;"where Andy Warhol is just eating a Burger King burger?"
22:34;22:35;"- Oh, and like he's in it."
22:35;22:37;"- Yeah, it's- - Oh, no."
22:37;22:39;"- You know, I've seen references to that before."
22:39;22:40;"- Wow."
22:40;22:41;"- Yeah. - Wait, what year?"
22:41;22:44;"- It was taken from a 1982 film called"
22:44;22:47;"""66 Scenes from America,"" like an art house film"
22:47;22:49;"by this guy, Jorgen Leth."
22:49;22:52;"But it made me think like, Jake, how would you feel"
22:52;22:57;"if that Taco Bell video was like repurposed posthumously"
22:57;23:01;"for a real Taco Bell ad, you know, in 70 years or something?"
23:01;23:02;"- Or now."
23:02;23:03;"- Oh yeah, there you go."
23:03;23:05;"- Well, I don't wanna die right now, but-"
23:05;23:06;"(laughing)"
23:06;23:09;"- Or, all right, it doesn't have to be posthumously,"
23:09;23:10;"just that fact. - Yeah."
23:10;23:11;"I mean, yeah, I'm in touch with Jason."
23:11;23:13;"I bet he has those videos."
23:13;23:14;"- I wanna see it."
23:14;23:16;"I mean, track that down because if Taco Bell doesn't buy it,"
23:16;23:18;"maybe Vampire Weekend will."
23:18;23:20;"- You gotta get clearance from Pearl Jam."
23:20;23:21;"(laughing)"
23:21;23:23;"- Well, I think I'd reply-"
23:23;23:24;"(laughing)"
23:24;23:25;"- Put yourself-"
23:25;23:30;"- Wait, it's just like, it's just Vampire Weekend, Jeremy."
23:30;23:33;"And then people are like, wait, is this a cover?"
23:33;23:37;"And just be like, well, through the artistic process"
23:37;23:42;"of transferring this 1997 VHS, we did in fact remix it."
23:42;23:45;"This is Vampire Weekend's version of it."
23:45;23:47;"We did use the original recording from 10"
23:47;23:49;"as source material."
23:49;23:52;"However, this is Vampire Weekend's version."
23:52;23:54;"We get on the phone with Pearl Jam's lawyers."
23:54;23:56;"We're like, so we wanna present this"
23:56;23:58;"as Vampire Weekend's version."
23:58;24:01;"We're just like, so how do you wanna split the master?"
24:01;24:03;"And the lawyer's like, we'll take 100%."
24:03;24:05;"We're like, we're taking 50/50."
24:05;24:07;"I mean, this is the Vampire version."
24:07;24:12;"Any audiophile will be able to detect the difference."
24:12;24:14;"(laughing)"
24:14;24:19;"- Dude, that is the most up your own ass art school theory."
24:19;24:22;"There are very historically,"
24:22;24:25;"I can think of one historically prominent photographer"
24:25;24:27;"and her whole thing was like photographing,"
24:27;24:30;"re-photographing famous photographs."
24:30;24:31;"Like she would re-photograph"
24:31;24:34;"like a Dorothea Lange migrant mother photo"
24:34;24:37;"or re-photograph like a Walker Evans,"
24:37;24:39;"Depression era portrait of someone."
24:39;24:40;"And then that was her art."
24:40;24:42;"And it was like this whole thing about like,"
24:42;24:45;"what does authorship even mean, man?"
24:45;24:46;"Like that kind of stuff."
24:46;24:47;"- Right, right."
24:47;24:49;"I loved (laughing)"
24:49;24:54;"just Vampire Weekend releases a lo-fi version"
24:54;24:56;"of Pearl Jam's Jeremy."
24:56;24:57;"- I'm trying to think,"
24:57;24:59;"somebody must've done that."
24:59;25:00;"I mean, you've definitely heard (beep)"
25:00;25:03;"where people have gone beyond sampling"
25:03;25:06;"and straight up just like sang over an entire song."
25:06;25:08;"There's obviously, I guess you could call it"
25:08;25:10;"instances of extreme samplings."
25:10;25:14;"I definitely can't think of like a prominent artist"
25:14;25:16;"just like straight up being like"
25:16;25:17;"the patina. (laughing)"
25:17;25:19;"Would you like an artist statement?"
25:19;25:24;"Like the patina created by the VHS transferred to YouTube,"
25:24;25:28;"plus the 23 years of time is our authorship."
25:28;25:31;"(laughing)"
25:31;25:33;"We did not contact Pearl Jam"
25:33;25:34;"because of course as artists,"
25:34;25:38;"they will understand that this is our Jeremy."
25:38;25:40;"- Completely gaslighting Pearl Jam."
25:40;25:42;"- We released an official soundtrack"
25:42;25:45;"to Portland, Oregon, Taco Bell in 1997."
25:45;25:46;"- Yeah."
25:46;25:47;"- By Jason Anderson."
25:47;25:48;"- Yeah."
25:48;25:49;"- But okay, if we don't wanna go that poor hazy"
25:49;25:53;"and we could also just slap it on a new vampire song."
25:53;25:54;"Maybe I've got to write one"
25:54;25:58;"that has a kind of young Jake Taco Bell energy."
25:58;26:01;"- Yeah, think about this incredibly lo-fi,"
26:01;26:03;"just terrible VHS quality."
26:03;26:07;"Me like very thin and young and like pale"
26:07;26:10;"with a very young Adam Faulkner,"
26:10;26:13;"the two of us eating burritos at Taco Bell."
26:13;26:14;"Very teal vibe."
26:14;26:16;"- Oh, like the old Taco Bells."
26:16;26:17;"- Yeah."
26:17;26:18;"- The jazzy Taco Bells."
26:18;26:21;"- Right, teal with like highlights of salmon."
26:21;26:24;"(laughing)"
26:24;26:26;"- Teal Taco Bell."

27:22;27:24;"What Pearl Jam song do you think"
27:24;27:27;"Vampire Weekend could cover live?"
27:27;27:29;"Or like if someone was like gunned to head,"

27:47;27:50;"Their fourth album, ""No Code,"""
27:50;27:52;"which threw some fans for a loop."
27:52;27:54;"But actually had some strong songs."
27:54;27:56;"And there was my local radio station"
27:56;27:57;"played one of the singles a lot."
27:57;27:59;"That's called ""Who You Are."""
27:59;28:02;"It's like kind of like a droney Indian Pearl Jam song."

28:10;28:12;"- And you know, as a student of rock history,"
28:12;28:13;"I've definitely spent some time"
28:13;28:15;"digging into Pearl Jam set lists"
28:15;28:17;"'cause they switch up set lists a lot."
28:17;28:19;"So I'm always curious about bands who do that"
28:19;28:23;"because obviously that's become a real priority for Vampire."
28:23;28:25;"Just, you know, it takes some figuring out."
28:25;28:27;"Like how much do you keep the same every night?"
28:27;28:29;"How different, how much do you like spread out the albums?"
28:29;28:32;"And I've noticed that they don't play that song too often."
28:32;28:35;"So I feel like it wouldn't be quite as crazy as just like,"
28:35;28:39;"if we just bust it out like a live or Jeremy."
28:39;28:41;"First of all, I think I would sound terrible singing that."

30:28;30:29;"just like smash everything up."
30:29;30:33;"Just like, ""What the is wrong with you, man?"""
30:33;30:36;"- You're just like dunking your face in ice water."
30:36;30:37;"- In ice water, just like,"
30:37;30:41;"""You're stupid, you're, okay, all right."""
30:41;30:42;"It is hard to find a way in."
30:42;30:43;"I mean, here's the thing."
30:43;30:46;"I guess that's why Herm Yarl became a thing"
30:46;30:49;"is because Eddie Vedder's voice is so idiosyncratic."
30:49;30:52;"It's like in for a penny, in for a pound."
30:52;30:53;"- Yeah."
30:53;30:56;"- And we will talk more about Herm Yarl in the new year."
30:56;30:57;"We're gonna go deep on it."
30:57;30:59;"Maybe it'll come up again later."
30:59;31:01;"I guess we should get Winter on the horn."
31:01;31:04;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
31:04;31:06;"(phone ringing)"
31:06;31:10;"- Hello folks, how are you doing?"
31:10;31:12;"- Winter, welcome back, man."
31:12;31:14;"- It's good to see you, my friends."
31:14;31:16;"It's very good to see you."
31:16;31:20;"I am ready to interact and have contacts with you."
31:20;31:20;"(Winter laughing)"
31:20;31:21;"- Let's do it."
31:21;31:24;"- First things first, I gotta congratulate you folks."
31:24;31:26;"You've had a heck of a year."
31:26;31:29;"All of you, I mean, Ezra's recording again."
31:29;31:31;"Bio's got an album coming out."
31:31;31:32;"- That's right."
31:32;31:35;"- Jake's got a ton of buzz."
31:35;31:36;"I've seen at least two articles"
31:36;31:37;"and there's probably been more."
31:37;31:39;"I mean, he's rockstar level now."
31:39;31:41;"- Of the back of Mountain Bruce."
31:41;31:43;"- Yeah, Seinfeld's always popular."
31:43;31:47;"So, you know, I feel like, oh, and then Jake's wife."
31:47;31:49;"Oh, Jake's wife's got her show."
31:49;31:50;"I just watched the eighth episode."
31:50;31:51;"- Oh, that's right."
31:51;31:54;"- Rashida's got a movie, the TV show"
31:54;31:55;"and the podcast with Bill Gates."
31:55;31:56;"She's been busy."
31:56;31:57;"- That's right."
31:57;32:00;"- This is a real pep talk session for the TC family."
32:00;32:01;"I appreciate it."
32:01;32:02;"- All right, we appreciate that, Winter."
32:02;32:06;"I'm not just a guest, I'm a fan."
32:06;32:08;"- All right, we appreciate that."
32:08;32:10;"- Well, so Winter, also, you know,"
32:10;32:12;"let's talk about your year, man."
32:12;32:15;"I gotta say, we're all proud of you and the TC community"
32:15;32:17;"'cause we talk to you right when things are shutting down,"
32:17;32:19;"but judging by your Instagram"
32:19;32:21;"and everybody follows you on social media,"
32:21;32:25;"you haven't let this crazy, terrible year"
32:25;32:28;"slow you down in terms of Starbucksing."
32:28;32:31;"You've been out there almost like a normal year."
32:31;32:34;"- I know there's been a lot of elements of it."
32:34;32:37;"- More than a normal year."
32:37;32:38;"- Really?"
32:38;32:42;"- Because the pandemic broke the rules"
32:42;32:45;"when it came to programming."
32:45;32:47;"These defense companies that I've worked for"
32:47;32:51;"would typically never let a contractor work remotely,"
32:51;32:53;"but they had no choice."
32:53;32:58;"So for the first time in my 23-year career"
32:58;33:04;"as a IT contractor, I was able to hit the road"
33:04;33:07;"for a prolonged period of time and work a 40-hour week."
33:07;33:08;"- We've talked to you in the past"
33:08;33:11;"about how you use Wi-Fi and stuff."
33:11;33:13;"I know you spend a lot of time in Panera's,"
33:13;33:16;"but when you're actually working a 40-hour week"
33:16;33:18;"and you're on the road Starbucking,"
33:18;33:20;"did you ever hit like a hard wall"
33:20;33:24;"where like a lack of internet was like messing things up?"
33:24;33:26;"You got the Pentagon calling you just like,"
33:26;33:28;"""Winter, where the hell are you?"""
33:28;33:30;"You're just like, ""I'm at the Starbucks,"
33:30;33:32;"""I just need Wi-Fi."""
33:32;33:33;"- No, no, no."
33:33;33:36;"It was never a problem like that."
33:36;33:40;"Internet is ubiquitous throughout the United States."
33:40;33:44;"There was a few stretches where I was offline"
33:44;33:48;"for let's say three, four, five hours."
33:48;33:51;"And once I got to the next coffee shop"
33:51;33:55;"or Panera or wherever, I had some work stacked up"
33:55;33:56;"that I needed to hurry up and do,"
33:56;33:58;"but it generally hasn't been a problem."
33:58;34:03;"The worst thing was once Starbucks, well, two things."
34:03;34:08;"A lot of the newer Starbucks will have very slow internet"
34:08;34:10;"before Google or whatever company they're using now"
34:10;34:14;"comes by and wires them up for the fast internet."
34:14;34:18;"So in those cases, I needed to get my coffee,"
34:18;34:20;"check the store off my list,"
34:20;34:23;"then move on to a nearby store that was older"
34:23;34:25;"and had better Wi-Fi so I could actually work."
34:25;34:28;"Then right in the middle of November,"
34:28;34:31;"Starbucks shut down all their lobbies."
34:31;34:35;"They got ahead of this second wave or third wave of COVID"
34:35;34:37;"and didn't wanna take any chances."
34:37;34:39;"That's why you saw me at all these Paneras"
34:39;34:42;"because Panera has kept their lobbies open."
34:42;34:45;"Panera's Wi-Fi is not as good as Starbucks."
34:45;34:47;"And occasionally I'd run into one"
34:47;34:49;"where it was almost unusable."
34:49;34:52;"Like I would keep getting disconnected from my system at work"
34:52;34:56;"and I would have to pack it up and find another Panera."
34:56;34:59;"But mostly it's worked out fine."
34:59;35:00;"- That's amazing."
35:00;35:03;"And also it seems like you've made it"
35:03;35:06;"through the whole year crisscrossing this country,"
35:06;35:09;"not just this country, multiple countries,"
35:09;35:14;"doing your thing and seem to have stayed healthy, COVID free."
35:14;35:16;"Were there ever any scares,"
35:16;35:17;"like somebody got too close to you"
35:17;35:20;"or you were seeing so much of the country,"
35:20;35:23;"you're in a weird situation that didn't feel safe?"
35:23;35:24;"- Absolutely."
35:24;35:27;"There were quite a few cafes where I thought"
35:27;35:30;"either this state doesn't have adequate requirements"
35:30;35:33;"for distancing or this cafe"
35:33;35:35;"is just ignoring the requirements."
35:35;35:37;"But what I would generally try and do"
35:37;35:41;"is get a chunk of work done"
35:41;35:44;"and then move on to the next destination if possible."
35:44;35:46;"I wouldn't say though that I'm necessarily"
35:46;35:48;"got through the year COVID free."
35:48;35:50;"There's really no way for me to have it."
35:50;35:53;"I tried to get an antibody test done in Houston"
35:53;35:55;"because I was hanging out at a Starbucks"
35:55;35:57;"that just happened to be next to a clinic,"
35:57;35:59;"but they never sent me my antibody test results."
35:59;36:02;"And yeah, I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on the phone"
36:02;36:03;"trying to get those results"
36:03;36:06;"because ultimately it's not gonna change my behavior."
36:06;36:07;"I'm still gonna mask up."
36:07;36:09;"I'm still gonna social distance."
36:09;36:10;"I'm still not gonna take risks."
36:10;36:13;"I don't care if I get the antibodies or not."
36:13;36:14;"Right, makes sense."

36:49;36:51;"- Well, so one thing we definitely wanna talk to you about"
36:51;36:54;"is that you were down Mexico way."
36:54;36:58;"- Yeah, that was actually my only other country"
36:58;37:00;"because I haven't been able to get into Canada."
37:00;37:02;"- 'Cause Canada is a lot more hardcore"
37:02;37:04;"with their COVID protocol."
37:04;37:06;"- Absolutely, and that's actually one of the places"
37:06;37:09;"where I've already lost at least one store,"
37:09;37:12;"one out in Newfoundland in St. John's,"
37:12;37:13;"and I might lose some more"
37:13;37:17;"because they're saying possibly all the way up to 2021,"
37:17;37:19;"we won't be able to get in, I don't know."
37:19;37:21;"- What do you mean lose a store?"
37:21;37:24;"- Like it's gone, it's the one at the chapters"
37:24;37:27;"in St. John's on Newfoundland."
37:27;37:31;"It was actually a very old store that used to be licensed,"
37:31;37:33;"thus it did not count for me."
37:33;37:37;"But then in May of 2017,"
37:37;37:40;"Starbucks took over the remaining 11 Starbucks"
37:40;37:43;"that were still operated by chapters,"
37:43;37:47;"and so they all became eligible for my Starbucks project."
37:47;37:51;"But some of them were in remote locations like Newfoundland,"
37:51;37:52;"one of them is in Thunder Bay,"
37:52;37:54;"not sure if that one's gonna survive."
37:54;37:58;"Another one's in, oh, another one was in Victoria"
37:58;37:59;"on Vancouver Island."
37:59;38:02;"I visited that store literally a week"
38:02;38:06;"before they shut it down to move it to a new location."
38:06;38:08;"- So these are ones you had on your list,"
38:08;38:10;"and now who knows if you'll get to see them."
38:10;38:12;"- The St. John's one is gone."
38:12;38:13;"- Oh, it's gone. - They shut that."
38:13;38:16;"Yeah, that's gone, that's one that I'll never get to see."
38:16;38:18;"And the same thing happened down Mexico way"
38:18;38:21;"when I got down to Monterrey,"
38:21;38:24;"there were a number at least three, four, maybe five"
38:24;38:26;"that were closed permanently."
38:26;38:28;"There's a few, a couple of universities,"
38:28;38:32;"one in a business district that are temporarily closed"
38:32;38:35;"and might be open if and when I ever return."
38:35;38:38;"But for the most part, that was a highly successful trip."
38:38;38:42;"I got to almost, I think almost 60 stores."
38:42;38:44;"- Oh my God."
38:44;38:47;"- Yeah, only one of them I couldn't go into."
38:47;38:49;"- Well, so first of all, you just drove there?"
38:49;38:50;"You crossed the border in your car?"
38:50;38:52;"- No, you can't, you can't."
38:52;38:55;"This is the thing, the border is closed."
38:55;38:57;"- The US-Mexico border's closed."
38:57;38:59;"- The land border is closed,"
38:59;39:02;"but Mexico needs the tourist dollars."
39:02;39:07;"So they're still allowing US citizens to get in by air"
39:07;39:09;"without a quarantine requirement,"
39:09;39:11;"without proof of a negative COVID test."
39:11;39:12;"The only thing that they require"
39:12;39:17;"is you fill out a questionnaire with the usual questions."
39:17;39:18;"Have you had any symptoms?"
39:18;39:19;"Have you had a cough?"
39:19;39:21;"Have you been in contact with anybody with COVID?"
39:21;39:23;"It generates a QR code that you then present"
39:23;39:25;"when you get to the airport."
39:25;39:26;"But even that is lax."
39:26;39:30;"I was not asked for my QR code when I got to the airport."
39:30;39:33;"When I flew out, however, they asked me,"
39:33;39:34;"""Do you have this form?"""
39:34;39:35;"I pulled it out of my backpack,"
39:35;39:38;"but they didn't actually scan the QR code"
39:38;39:39;"and examine the questions."
39:39;39:41;"So, you know, it's like,"
39:41;39:44;"I suspect it's that way all over the world."
39:44;39:47;"Just depends on who you are and who's in charge,"
39:47;39:50;"how serious they enforce the COVID restrictions"
39:50;39:51;"that are on paper."
39:51;39:52;"- Right."
39:52;39:55;"Well, so normally when you're Starbucks-ing in the US,"
39:55;39:58;"you're driving in your car from place to place,"
39:58;40:00;"and you often sleep in your car,"
40:00;40:01;"save money on hotels."
40:01;40:03;"What do you do when you fly somewhere?"
40:03;40:04;"Like when you fly to Monterey?"
40:04;40:07;"- Well, typically I would stay in a hostel,"
40:07;40:10;"but another COVID precaution was"
40:10;40:11;"I didn't even look for hostels."
40:11;40:13;"I just went ahead and booked a hotel"
40:13;40:15;"because I didn't want to expose myself to more people."
40:15;40:19;"Typically I take public transportation."
40:19;40:22;"I consider it part of the challenge"
40:22;40:24;"to see how many stores I can get to"
40:24;40:27;"by bus, walking, train, et cetera."
40:27;40:29;"But again, because of COVID,"
40:29;40:32;"it was just safer to rent a car."
40:32;40:34;"- And it seemed like, were you heading some other places"
40:34;40:35;"when you were in Monterey?"
40:35;40:36;"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
40:36;40:40;"I think I got three or four different independent cafes."
40:40;40:42;"I mean, you're traveling all the way down"
40:42;40:43;"to this foreign country."
40:43;40:44;"You don't know when you're going to be back."
40:44;40:47;"You might as well get as much as possible."
40:47;40:48;"So yeah, I definitely wanted to see"
40:48;40:49;"what the coffee was like down there"
40:49;40:52;"and see if I could have any good experiences"
40:52;40:53;"with Mexican coffees."
40:53;40:58;"Traditionally, I have not enjoyed coffees from Mexico."
40:58;41:00;"This was no different."
41:00;41:01;"There were only a couple of cups"
41:01;41:03;"that I could say that I really enjoyed."
41:03;41:05;"Most of them were mediocre,"
41:05;41:07;"but that's just my preference."
41:07;41:11;"From Central America, I prefer with coffees from Colombia."
41:11;41:14;"Peru has some good coffees, also Nicaragua."
41:14;41:19;"- But the Starbucks coffee in Monterey, same as anywhere?"
41:19;41:21;"- Same as anywhere, although I would say"
41:21;41:26;"that it was more consistently better brewed"
41:27;41:29;"than a lot of the coffees I've had here"
41:29;41:31;"in the United States."
41:31;41:36;"But they don't always have coffee brewed."
41:36;41:38;"And in those cases, when I would ask"
41:38;41:39;"for the coffee of the day,"
41:39;41:44;"they would just give me an Americano without telling me."
41:44;41:46;"I think in the United States,"
41:46;41:48;"they would tell you that it's an Americano."
41:48;41:50;"They would offer to do a pour over,"
41:50;41:52;"or they would say, ""Can I pour you an Americano?"""
41:52;41:54;"In Mexico, they didn't just tell me."
41:54;41:55;"I could just taste it."
41:55;41:56;"You can taste the difference"
41:56;41:58;"between an Americano and brewed coffee."
41:58;42:00;"- Well, and that seems to be a confusion"
42:00;42:02;"in most places outside of the US,"
42:02;42:06;"where if you order a coffee, you might get an Americano"
42:06;42:09;"because the American brewed coffee experience"
42:09;42:11;"is kind of specific."
42:11;42:13;"- Yes, you are 100% correct."
42:13;42:16;"- Although you would think at Starbucks,"
42:16;42:18;"being a big American corporation,"
42:18;42:20;"it might be a little clearer."
42:20;42:24;"- Yeah, but still, if you go to India, for example,"
42:24;42:26;"when I went to Bangalore, when I went to Mumbai,"
42:26;42:29;"they don't even have the coffee brewing machines."
42:29;42:32;"If you actually want brewed coffee,"
42:32;42:34;"your only option is a French press,"
42:34;42:36;"or you can get an Americano."
42:36;42:39;"- No brewed coffee at Indian Starbucks."
42:39;42:40;"- No brewed coffee."
42:40;42:43;"- That honestly sounds like a superior experience"
42:43;42:45;"'cause the brewed coffee at Starbucks"
42:45;42:47;"is basically inedible."
42:47;42:50;"(all laughing)"
42:50;42:51;"- You're not wrong."
42:51;42:54;"- An Americano is also more expensive."
42:54;42:55;"- Yes, yes."
42:55;42:56;"- Than a brewed coffee."
42:56;42:59;"So I think they think, oh, of course he'd want that."
42:59;43:01;"I'm giving him a more expensive coffee."
43:01;43:02;"- But not in Mexico."
43:02;43:04;"They charged me the same thing."
43:04;43:07;"Oh, and it was, because of the exchange rate,"
43:07;43:08;"it was cheaper too."
43:08;43:10;"I was only paying about a buck 50."
43:10;43:13;"So I ended up spending a lot less on coffee"
43:13;43:14;"than I had budgeted."
43:14;43:18;"I actually have a Mexican Starbucks card with me"
43:18;43:20;"that's almost completely full"
43:20;43:22;"because I didn't use it all up."
43:22;43:23;"- Oh, wow."
43:23;43:26;"And then when you mapped out your trip,"
43:26;43:28;"were you having like lunch and dinner?"
43:28;43:31;"Were there specific like Monterey restaurants"
43:31;43:35;"that you were trying to make sure you hit?"
43:35;43:37;"Or this trip was about Starbucking,"
43:37;43:40;"so it's like eat whatever is quick and easy."
43:40;43:42;"- Yeah, the trip was about Starbucking"
43:42;43:45;"with the independent coffee houses thrown in."
43:45;43:48;"I did want to try and have some actual meals,"
43:48;43:50;"but I wasn't looking for them."
43:50;43:52;"So it's like there was one evening"
43:52;43:54;"where I just stumbled across a restaurant,"
43:54;43:57;"little cafe, hole in the wall that was about to close."
43:57;43:59;"And I had a dish, I can't remember what it's called,"
43:59;44:02;"but it's typical of Northern Mexico."
44:02;44:04;"So that was a good experience,"
44:04;44:07;"but that was just randomly stumbled across that."
44:07;44:09;"I did find the, probably saw my pictures"
44:09;44:12;"of the food cart noshery that I stumbled across."
44:12;44:13;"I love those."
44:13;44:16;"Then of course I had to have my ramen experience"
44:16;44:18;"that I try to have everywhere I go."
44:18;44:18;"- Oh, right."
44:18;44:20;"So yeah, I've noticed that ramen,"
44:20;44:22;"is that archived on the website,"
44:22;44:23;"all the ramen places you hit?"
44:23;44:24;"- It is not."
44:24;44:26;"I actually have a Google map,"
44:26;44:30;"like my Duck Donuts everywhere map"
44:30;44:31;"and some other maps that I keep,"
44:31;44:34;"but I don't actually have a link to it anywhere."
44:34;44:36;"I just, I've got so much data,"
44:36;44:38;"places that I've been to that I don't have it all organized."
44:38;44:39;"One of these days."
44:39;44:41;"- That's actually what I wanted to ask you about next,"
44:41;44:43;"'cause I noticed on Instagram,"
44:43;44:46;"you're always talking about hidden duck donuts,"
44:46;44:48;"and I'm thinking, all right,"
44:48;44:51;"this awesome little chain that Winter's into."
44:51;44:53;"And then I feel like recently you were posting"
44:53;44:56;"about how you had just hit your 100th duck donuts."
44:56;44:58;"And I was like, what the hell?"
44:58;45:00;"So how many are there total, Winter?"
45:00;45:01;"You've hit a hundred."
45:01;45:03;"How many duck donuts are there?"
45:03;45:05;"- I've been to 105 now."
45:05;45:10;"There's roughly 97 or 98, maybe a hundred that have opened."
45:10;45:13;"The discrepancy is that at least 10, 11,"
45:13;45:16;"maybe 12 have closed."
45:16;45:17;"- Okay."
45:17;45:18;"- The pandemic hit them a bit hard."
45:18;45:20;"I think almost half of the ones that have closed,"
45:20;45:23;"closed this year."
45:23;45:26;"But yeah, I just love their donuts."
45:26;45:28;"You guys are in California."
45:28;45:32;"There are two locations out there that are still open."
45:32;45:34;"The one down in Encinitas closed,"
45:34;45:38;"but Irvine and I believe Huntington Beach are still open."
45:38;45:39;"- Yeah."
45:39;45:40;"- Really?"
45:40;45:41;"- Maybe Santa Ana too."
45:41;45:42;"- I think that might be the one,"
45:42;45:44;"that's right next to Irvine, right?"
45:44;45:45;"It's in a-"
45:45;45:46;"- Yeah."
45:46;45:47;"- There's a food hall."
45:47;45:48;"That's really cool."
45:48;45:49;"I don't know if you've been there,"
45:49;45:52;"but there's this really cool food hall there."
45:52;45:55;"That's another thing that I pursue unofficially."
45:55;45:58;"I love the food hall concept."
45:58;46:00;"One of the things that I love is they typically"
46:00;46:02;"don't have a lot of chains."
46:02;46:05;"They're more local, more independent restaurants."
46:05;46:09;"As opposed to a shopping mall or a retail plaza."
46:09;46:10;"You know, you've seen from my post"
46:10;46:13;"that I'm big on pushing the indie and the small businesses."
46:13;46:15;"- Absolutely, respect that."
46:15;46:17;"But where's Duck Donuts from?"
46:17;46:22;"- Believe it or not, they started in Duck, North Carolina."
46:22;46:25;"- Oh, I didn't even, I've never heard of that town."
46:25;46:27;"- Yeah, it's in the Outer Banks."
46:27;46:32;"You know, now they've expanded to maybe 10, maybe 15 states."
46:32;46:33;"- Do you have a go-to donut?"
46:33;46:38;"- Yeah, it's just a plain cake donut with powdered sugar."
46:38;46:41;"Although after about 50 or 60 of those, I said,"
46:41;46:43;"""You know what, I'm gonna try every combination."""
46:43;46:46;"You know, you've probably noticed that the way my mind works"
46:46;46:48;"is like collecting and patterns"
46:48;46:50;"and organizing things like that."
46:50;46:55;"So they've got coatings, toppings, and drizzles."
46:55;46:58;"So I'm basically going through every permutation"
46:58;47:01;"of every coating, topping, and drizzle."
47:01;47:03;"- Is it like made to order?"
47:03;47:05;"- You tell them what you want, yeah, yeah."
47:05;47:05;"They're not pre-made."
47:05;47:08;"- Okay, so that's the whole Duck Donuts concept is"
47:08;47:10;"we give you exactly what you're looking for."
47:10;47:12;"- And they're made when you order them,"
47:12;47:14;"so they come right out of the machine."
47:14;47:18;"And thus the texture of the donut is much different"
47:18;47:21;"than a donut that's made at two or three in the morning,"
47:21;47:23;"like Dunkin' or Shipley's or Krispy Kreme."
47:23;47:25;"- Are they warm?"
47:25;47:27;"- Oh yeah, when they come out of the machine, absolutely."
47:27;47:31;"And they almost melt in your mouth, almost."
47:31;47:33;"- By machine, you mean deep fryer."
47:33;47:34;"- Yes, yeah, a donut deep fryer."
47:43;47:46;"♪ A young man went out and made a name for himself ♪"
47:46;47:48;"♪ He's been on every record-breaking show ♪"

48:01;48:25;"- I wanna update you on the latest news from Dunk Donuts."
48:25;48:29;"They opened a location in September of this year in Dubai."
48:29;48:29;"- Yeah, yep."
48:29;48:30;"- Oh wow."
48:30;48:32;"- I was actually considering Dubai"
48:32;48:36;"as a place to go for my 16,000 store,"
48:36;48:40;"but even though a lot of people aren't flying"
48:40;48:43;"and the emissions from air travel this year"
48:43;48:44;"are almost nothing,"
48:44;48:47;"I still have a hard time justifying"
48:47;48:50;"flying all the way to Dubai and back."
48:50;48:53;"I'm really holding off on that Asia, Europe trip"
48:53;48:55;"until I can do the entire world,"
48:55;48:58;"again, just to minimize carbon footprint."
48:58;49:02;"Also, I don't wanna be on a flight for 12 hours"
49:02;49:03;"with COVID in the air."
49:03;49:04;"- That's terrible."
49:04;49:06;"- Yeah, that's stressful."
49:06;49:07;"Maybe next year."
49:07;49:09;"- Exactly, 2022."
49:09;49:11;"- I wanna write a song about being at the Dunk Donuts"
49:11;49:13;"in Dubai."
49:13;49:14;"Good alliteration."
49:14;49:15;"- You know, there's--"
49:15;49:17;"- That sounds like a Mountain Brews song,"
49:17;49:18;"to be honest with you."
49:18;49:21;"(laughing)"
49:21;49:23;"- When Mountain Brews transitions"
49:23;49:28;"into just weird late 2000s rich guy classic rock,"
49:28;49:29;"(laughing)"
49:29;49:31;"the 10th EP,"
49:31;49:35;"and it's just Jake is on some Eric Clapton,"
49:35;49:40;"really into watches and $70,000 guitars and (beep),"
49:40;49:42;"there's just a song about just being"
49:42;49:44;"at the Dunk Donuts in Dubai."
49:44;49:45;"- And you wash it down"
49:45;49:47;"with the worst margarita of your life."
49:47;49:48;"- Exactly."
49:48;49:49;"(laughing)"
49:49;49:50;"- Wait, so, but Winter,"
49:50;49:52;"just to really understand Dunk Donuts,"
49:52;49:55;"they don't even have the traditional trays of donuts"
49:55;49:56;"in the back?"
49:56;49:57;"- No, they do not."
49:57;50:00;"- Every single one is fresh made to order, okay."
50:00;50:04;"- Yeah, I mean, it's possible that they might make an order"
50:04;50:06;"and then somebody doesn't come and pick it up."
50:06;50:07;"- Right."
50:07;50:10;"- That would really be the only time that they--"
50:10;50:12;"- So what's the wait time?"
50:12;50:14;"- Oh my Lord."
50:14;50:16;"When some of these Dunk Donuts have opened up,"
50:16;50:19;"they've had lines out the door for days"
50:19;50:20;"because of the wait time."
50:20;50:23;"That's one of the reasons, yeah, no, I'm not kidding."
50:23;50:24;"- It's a donut!"
50:24;50:27;"- Westchester County, when I went to the one in,"
50:27;50:29;"I don't even know how to pronounce it."
50:29;50:31;"How do you pronounce Mamaroneck?"
50:31;50:32;"- It's like Mamaroneck."
50:32;50:33;"- Yeah, Mamaroneck."
50:33;50:36;"When I went to that one, I waited in line for quite a bit"
50:36;50:39;"and I was asking some guy in line behind me"
50:39;50:42;"if he'd been there before and he said that for days,"
50:42;50:45;"they'd had lines out the door and around the corner."
50:45;50:47;"- Are there any in Massachusetts?"
50:47;50:49;"- Not yet, no Connecticut, no,"
50:49;50:51;"the furthest up to New England they get"
50:51;50:52;"is that one in Mamaroneck."
50:52;50:53;"- Is that one in Mamaroneck?"
50:53;50:55;"That'll be really (beep) up"
50:55;50:57;"when they open their first one in Massachusetts."
50:57;51:00;"Just like, that'll be really crossing a line,"
51:00;51:02;"getting deep into Dunkin--"
51:02;51:03;"Getting deep into Dunkin' country"
51:03;51:05;"and just you picture like a bunch of like guys"
51:05;51:07;"driving to Dunkin' Donuts in the morning,"
51:07;51:08;"they see the line at Dunk Donuts,"
51:08;51:12;"they're like, ""What the (beep) is wrong with you people?"
51:12;51:14;"""You (beep) morons!"
51:14;51:16;"""Are you (beep) kidding me?"
51:16;51:18;"""You (beep) losers!"""
51:18;51:20;"But that must be a very different experience."
51:20;51:23;"A hot, made to your specification donut."
51:23;51:25;"I couldn't help but think when you talk about"
51:25;51:27;"the fact that they don't make these at 2 a.m.,"
51:27;51:31;"I'm thinking back to the Dunkin' Donuts ad campaign"
51:31;51:33;"that we've discussed on Time Crisis multiple times."
51:33;51:36;"Winter, perhaps you remember the famous guy,"
51:36;51:39;"he was Fred the Baker and he did these commercials."
51:39;51:41;"- Yeah, yeah, ""Time to make the donuts."""
51:41;51:44;"- So you could almost imagine a Dunk Donuts commercial"
51:44;51:46;"where they like get some dude dressed up like Fred"
51:46;51:48;"and he wakes up, it's like, ""Time to make the donuts."""
51:48;51:51;"And his wife is like, ""Oh, you're leaving again?"""
51:51;51:53;"He's like, ""I gotta make the donuts."""
51:53;51:55;"And then just like a giant duck pulls up"
51:55;51:58;"and they're just like, ""Fred, quit being a martyr,"
51:58;51:59;"""you piece of (beep)"
51:59;52:01;"""You never see your family anymore."
52:01;52:02;"""And you know what?"
52:02;52:04;"""All you're doing is creating donuts"
52:04;52:06;"""that are gonna be stale by the time"
52:06;52:08;"""people come to buy them."
52:08;52:10;"""You're not working smarter, you're working stupid."
52:10;52:14;"""You're tired as hell, probably shortening your lifespan."
52:14;52:15;"""Fred, don't do it."
52:15;52:17;"""There's nothing cool about waking up early"
52:17;52:19;"""to make the donuts."
52:19;52:21;"""You should make them one by one."
52:21;52:22;"""The people will appreciate it,"
52:22;52:24;"""your wife will appreciate it."
52:24;52:25;"""Don't do it, Fred."""
52:25;52:28;"His entire business model has been upended by Dunk Donuts."
52:28;52:30;"- Could be, but it remains to be seen"
52:30;52:33;"how many of these stores that they've opened up"
52:33;52:35;"in the last few years are gonna survive."
52:35;52:37;"I'm a little alarmed by their closure rate."
52:37;52:40;"But again, the pandemic has changed everything, so."
52:40;52:42;"- Well, and do you ever roll up to Dunk Donuts"
52:42;52:46;"and there's somebody who, maybe not during COVID times,"
52:46;52:49;"but before, when somebody's like,"
52:49;52:53;"an intern is rolling down to pick up like a box of 24"
52:53;52:56;"for the breakfast at the office,"
52:56;52:58;"does that suddenly just like make the person behind them"
52:58;53:00;"have to wait an extra like 30 minutes?"
53:00;53:02;"- Absolutely, yes."
53:02;53:04;"I have seen people ordering a dozen or two dozen donuts."
53:04;53:07;"And yes, everybody else just has to wait."
53:07;53:08;"- That's a problem."
53:08;53:09;"- Yeah, that's a big problem."
53:09;53:11;"- That's a problem for the business model."
53:11;53:16;"That's why I'm not bullish on their success."
53:16;53:19;"I love the donut."
53:19;53:21;"I don't know if the concept"
53:21;53:23;"can ever reach the level of a Dunkin'."
53:23;53:24;"- Wait, and if you had to guess,"
53:24;53:27;"how long does it take to make one Dunk Donut"
53:27;53:29;"that had some drizzle and some sprinkles,"
53:29;53:31;"some, you know, a little bull (beep) on it?"
53:31;53:33;"How long is that taking?"
53:33;53:35;"- Oh, geez, I'm so bad at noticing things."
53:35;53:37;"I would say one to two minutes to come out of the machine,"
53:37;53:40;"but it might be less than one minute."
53:40;53:42;"And then depending upon how complicated it is,"
53:42;53:46;"let's say you've got a topping, a coating, and a drizzle."
53:46;53:47;"I've seen that process."
53:47;53:49;"That is at least for all three of them,"
53:49;53:53;"at least two to three minutes, box it up."
53:53;53:55;"Could be a good five minutes, could be."
53:55;53:58;"I'm sure that some employees do it faster."
53:58;54:00;"But you can't make the machine go faster."
54:00;54:03;"- Unless they create some new tech, they need a new machine."
54:03;54:06;"You know what, they need to team up with Elizabeth Holmes"
54:06;54:08;"and get kind of like a Theranos situation"
54:08;54:12;"in which they create a kind of mini Duck Donuts box"
54:12;54:15;"that can do the donut much faster."
54:15;54:18;"And they could have them kiosks at Walgreens"
54:18;54:19;"and things like that."
54:19;54:23;"'Cause otherwise you're getting this bottleneck situation"
54:23;54:25;"where everybody's coming to the Duck Donuts,"
54:25;54:27;"but if they had a Theranos type machine,"
54:27;54:30;"you could be like, well, there's one at your public library."
54:30;54:33;"There's one at the Walgreens."
54:33;54:34;"- At the hospital."
54:34;54:36;"- There's one at the hospital."
54:36;54:39;"- And suddenly everybody's getting their Duck Donuts"
54:39;54:41;"with less wait time."
54:41;54:44;"- Before I forget, we should talk about the logistics"
54:44;54:47;"for Bolivia because they're actually quite interesting,"
54:47;54:48;"if you don't mind."
54:48;54:50;"- Wait, did you go to Bolivia too this year?"
54:50;54:54;"- No, no, that's where I plan to see my 16,000 store."
54:54;54:55;"- Oh, okay."
54:55;54:56;"- If I can get in."
54:56;54:57;"- If you can get there."
54:57;54:59;"Okay, so break it down, please."
54:59;55:01;"- That's where there's a lot of moving parts."
55:01;55:03;"First of all, I have to get into Panama."
55:03;55:06;"So the airport still has to be open."
55:06;55:09;"And actually two days ago, they instituted a curfew"
55:09;55:12;"from the 25th to the 28th."
55:12;55:15;"And then again, from the first to like the fourth."
55:15;55:18;"Coincidentally enough, I just happened to book my flights"
55:18;55:21;"for the 29th to the first to be in Panama."
55:21;55:24;"So I actually get to be there in a window"
55:24;55:27;"when things are open so I can run around buying medicines"
55:27;55:30;"and other stuff for my mother."
55:30;55:33;"But from Panama, I have to go to Bolivia."
55:33;55:35;"And I also need a COVID test."
55:35;55:37;"Oh, I need a COVID test for Panama."
55:37;55:40;"So once I get to the airport, for 50 bucks,"
55:40;55:41;"I'll be able to take a test."
55:41;55:44;"I actually have to take the test before I clear immigration."
55:44;55:48;"The test can't be older than 48 hours."
55:48;55:50;"So it makes sense just to do it there"
55:50;55:53;"as opposed to trying to find a place in Miami on Monday"
55:53;55:56;"to do it and turn it around immediately."
55:56;56:00;"For Bolivia, the test can't be older than seven days."
56:00;56:03;"So theoretically, that test that I take in Panama"
56:03;56:05;"should be good for Bolivia."
56:05;56:06;"But I don't know that for a fact."
56:06;56:09;"And I haven't been able to get anybody on the phone."
56:09;56:12;"- Right, especially it being two different countries."
56:12;56:15;"- The embassy page that lists all this information"
56:15;56:17;"for Bolivia, list the phone number for Cedes,"
56:17;56:19;"which is like their Ministry of Health."
56:19;56:22;"I tried to call them, I couldn't get through."
56:22;56:26;"I figure my best bet is when I get to the airport in Panama,"
56:26;56:28;"after I've cleared immigration,"
56:28;56:31;"go over to the Copa counter."
56:31;56:34;"Copa is the airline that I'm taking to Bolivia"
56:34;56:36;"and ask them because they're the ones"
56:36;56:40;"who would be stopping me from boarding"
56:40;56:42;"if I don't have the required test"
56:42;56:45;"because they don't want me to be stuck there"
56:45;56:47;"or have to bring me back."
56:47;56:49;"Then when I come back from Bolivia,"
56:49;56:52;"I'll have to have another test in Panama."
56:52;56:55;"So there's just a lot of things that could go wrong."
56:55;56:58;"Bolivia has lifted all its COVID restrictions"
56:58;56:59;"through January 15th."
56:59;57:01;"Fingers crossed that they don't impose them."
57:01;57:04;"The worst thing would be I get there"
57:04;57:05;"and all the Starbucks are closed."
57:05;57:08;"I've already called them to make sure that they're all open"
57:08;57:10;"from like 7 a.m. to 10 p.m."
57:10;57:13;"because I've got one day to see those six stores"
57:13;57:15;"and I may do it on foot."
57:15;57:17;"So that's gonna be an interesting trip."
57:17;57:19;"- And how many Starbucks are you trying to hit in Bolivia?"
57:19;57:21;"- Just six, they only have six."
57:21;57:23;"There's one-- - In the whole country?"
57:23;57:24;"- Yeah."
57:24;57:26;"- Are the six Starbucks all in,"
57:26;57:28;"with the capital city, La Paz?"
57:28;57:30;"- The capital city is La Paz,"
57:30;57:32;"but that's not where the Starbucks are."
57:32;57:35;"The Starbucks are in Santa Cruz de la Sierra."
57:35;57:40;"And they're all, once I arrive late on the first,"
57:40;57:44;"I can take the shuttle over to the hotel."
57:44;57:47;"In the morning, I can get a taxi down into the city"
57:47;57:50;"and I should be able to walk all six Starbucks"
57:50;57:54;"with plenty of time to look for any independent coffee."
57:54;57:56;"Although I don't know if they have a coffee scene"
57:56;57:58;"in Bolivia."
57:58;58:00;"I know that you like indie coffee houses, Ezra,"
58:00;58:03;"and I think you might be into that too."
58:03;58:05;"Have you ever seen coffee from Bolivia"
58:05;58:08;"served at any of the coffee houses in Southern California?"
58:08;58:09;"I never have."
58:09;58:11;"- I mean, I'll admit, I don't pay as much attention."
58:11;58:14;"I would guess that they grow coffee in Bolivia."
58:14;58:16;"- I would too, but maybe it's not the quality"
58:16;58:17;"that gets exported."
58:17;58:19;"You know, I mean, the same thing used to be true"
58:19;58:24;"for places like Rwanda, Uganda."
58:24;58:26;"You just never saw those coffees here in the US."
58:26;58:29;"Vietnam, because it just wasn't up"
58:29;58:31;"to craft coffee standards."
58:31;58:33;"But some of those countries have elevated"
58:33;58:35;"their coffee production mechanisms"
58:35;58:38;"to the point that some of the nicer shops,"
58:38;58:40;"the artisanal shops, the third wave shops here"
58:40;58:42;"are actually buying those coffees."
58:42;58:44;"But no idea about Bolivia."
58:44;58:47;"- So the capital city doesn't have any Starbucks."
58:47;58:48;"You said that these are all in the city."
58:48;58:50;"- No. - Santa Cruz."
58:50;58:52;"- Santa Cruz de la Sierra."
58:52;58:53;"- Is Santa Cruz de la Sierra"
58:53;58:57;"like a wealthier, more bourgeois town?"
58:57;58:59;"Do you have a sense of why they have all the Starbucks?"
58:59;59:01;"- Not a clue."
59:01;59:03;"I'm really organized in certain aspects,"
59:03;59:06;"but sometimes I'm like literally at the airport."
59:06;59:07;"I just arrived in a country,"
59:07;59:10;"like getting on the wifi, looking up the Wikipedia page."
59:10;59:12;"It's like, how do things work in this country?"
59:12;59:15;"- Yeah. - So I do not know."
59:15;59:16;"- Well, good luck down there."
59:16;59:17;"- It should be interesting."
59:17;59:19;"Even, you know what?"
59:19;59:23;"Even if I can't get into Bolivia, that's fine."
59:23;59:24;"Not the end of the world."
59:24;59:28;"I'd probably try to get on a plane back to Miami sooner"
59:28;59:30;"and see if I could hop on a flight to Mexico"
59:30;59:35;"just so I can do that 16,000 store in another country."
59:35;59:38;"I just do not wanna hit 16,000 in the US"
59:38;59:40;"'cause I've done that so many times,"
59:40;59:42;"that milestone so many times."
59:42;59:43;"It's kind of boring now."
59:43;59:45;"- Right, maybe hit like Mexico City."
59:45;59:47;"I went to some great coffee shops"
59:47;59:49;"last time I was in Mexico City."
59:49;59:51;"- Yeah, yeah. - Just nice cafes."
59:51;59:53;"- I think I might've seen one of your posts from Mexico."
59:53;59:55;"I'd probably go to Guadalajara"
59:55;59:57;"just because I've never been there before."
59:57;59:58;"- Oh yeah, Guadalajara's cool too."
59:58;01:00:01;"- Well, everyone was inside talking"
01:00:01;01:00:05;"in the cappuccino bar."
01:00:05;01:00:08;"Had to get outside rocking."
01:00:08;01:00:13;"Played on the old guitar."
01:00:13;01:00:17;"Now you're gonna get ready to give me a beat, right?"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"When the time comes."
01:00:19;01:00:22;"Because I couldn't stay inside talking."
01:00:22;01:00:24;"Had to get outside rocking."
01:00:24;01:00:27;"Well, three cappuccinos and a three croissant."
01:00:27;01:00:29;"Jonathan, Jonathan, what do you want?"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"Well, not me, not me."
01:00:31;01:00:34;"No, I couldn't sit down no more."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"'Cause I couldn't stay inside talking."
01:00:36;01:00:38;"Well, I had to get outside rocking."
01:00:38;01:00:42;"- You've been doing this for 23 years?"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"- 23 and a half, yeah."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"Next summer I'll be celebrating 24."
01:00:45;01:00:47;"What I'm really looking forward to"
01:00:47;01:00:50;"is my 25th anniversary when I will have been Starbucking"
01:00:50;01:00:53;"for half the time that I've been alive."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"- Wow."
01:00:54;01:00:57;"Oh, 25 and 50?"
01:00:57;01:00:58;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"I'll turn 50 in the same year"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"that I hit 25 years of Starbucking."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"- Amazing."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"I'm just doing a quick number crunch here."
01:01:04;01:01:09;"So on average, you're hitting 695 Starbucks a year."
01:01:09;01:01:10;"- I guess, yeah, yeah."
01:01:10;01:01:11;"Some years more than others."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"- Holy (beep)"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"- This has been a heavy year"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"just because of what I explained earlier."
01:01:15;01:01:19;"That I'm able to work and hit the road at the same time."
01:01:19;01:01:24;"And I was rushing to get to as many stores as possible"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"before they closed."
01:01:26;01:01:31;"There's still four outstanding stores in the US"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"that I worry about."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"And there's nothing I can do."
01:01:34;01:01:36;"They just haven't reopened because of COVID"
01:01:36;01:01:37;"and they never might."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"And there's just nothing I can do about that."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"There's the one in Canada that I lost."
01:01:40;01:01:41;"- Only four?"
01:01:41;01:01:42;"Wow."
01:01:42;01:01:44;"- When you say there's four outstanding stores in the US,"
01:01:44;01:01:48;"you mean there's only four that you haven't been to?"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"Or there's only four?"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"- There's four really old ones."
01:01:52;01:01:55;"Like Salesforce Tower in San Francisco."
01:01:55;01:01:58;"One of the relocated ones in downtown Chicago."
01:01:58;01:02:01;"A San Mateo store that inexplicably didn't do enough business"
01:02:01;01:02:02;"to reopen."
01:02:02;01:02:05;"It reopened and then shut down again because it was slow."
01:02:05;01:02:10;"And then there was one in Billings, Montana"
01:02:10;01:02:13;"that was closed because of COVID."
01:02:13;01:02:15;"When I happened to be there, I waited around"
01:02:15;01:02:19;"to see if the brother of the manager"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"actually contacted him and said,"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"""Hey, can you help this guy out?"""
01:02:23;01:02:25;"And he was going to, but then he got busy"
01:02:25;01:02:26;"trying to staff some other stores."
01:02:26;01:02:29;"And I waited about four hours and that was all I could give."
01:02:29;01:02:31;"- So you got four old ones that you haven't hit"
01:02:31;01:02:34;"plus what, 8,000 new ones?"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"- In the US, over 100."
01:02:36;01:02:39;"It was, when I made my last post saying,"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"""Look at this map, can you believe this?"""
01:02:41;01:02:42;"It was under 100."
01:02:42;01:02:45;"Since I made that post, about a dozen new stores"
01:02:45;01:02:48;"have opened up, so that's now over 100."
01:02:48;01:02:52;"- So you're only like 114 down in the US."
01:02:52;01:02:55;"- Now, but that'll double or triple"
01:02:55;01:02:59;"because once I get back from my 16,000 trip,"
01:02:59;01:03:00;"that was the big push."
01:03:00;01:03:05;"There was really no advantage to being on the road"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"constantly trying to keep up."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"It's not a good use of my time."
01:03:09;01:03:14;"I would rather focus on trying to get more of my book out."
01:03:14;01:03:18;"If I could plug for the Time Crisis listeners"
01:03:18;01:03:21;"who haven't seen my post yet,"
01:03:21;01:03:24;"I've got another chapter of my book on my website."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"- Yeah, I was checking that out."
01:03:25;01:03:26;"- That's more of them up there."
01:03:26;01:03:31;"And I hope that I can write faster in 2021"
01:03:31;01:03:33;"because I won't be bouncing all over the country"
01:03:33;01:03:35;"trying to hit as many Starbucks as possible."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"I mean, I feel kind of bad."
01:03:37;01:03:40;"I've written four chapters in nine months."
01:03:40;01:03:42;"Kazzy David got a whole book out."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"Taylor Swift got two albums out."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"- True."
01:03:46;01:03:49;"- Yeah, but dude, they don't even have close"
01:03:49;01:03:50;"to the responsibilities that you have"
01:03:50;01:03:51;"with cups of Starbucks."
01:03:51;01:03:55;"- Yeah, they're not hitting 700 Starbucks a year, dude."
01:03:55;01:03:56;"- Hey, hey, Winter."
01:03:56;01:04:00;"Hey, have you ever considered virtual Starbucks?"
01:04:00;01:04:02;"Just, you know, the nature of the times,"
01:04:02;01:04:06;"you could really scale yourself if you had a surrogate"
01:04:06;01:04:07;"out there at various Starbucks,"
01:04:07;01:04:10;"holding up a laptop, going in."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"And I don't think anybody would really fault you"
01:04:12;01:04:13;"for taking a virtual approach"
01:04:13;01:04:14;"and you could really, you know,"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"maximize your Starbucks."
01:04:16;01:04:18;"- Franchising, if you will."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"- That's what he asks."
01:04:19;01:04:22;"- I have considered, like, is there some way"
01:04:22;01:04:25;"within the spirit of Starbucking"
01:04:25;01:04:29;"that somebody could visit a store"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"and then transfer it to me?"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"Like, I don't know, like we-"
01:04:33;01:04:34;"- Artist's assistant."
01:04:34;01:04:37;"- We cut our hands and shake hands and exchange blood."
01:04:37;01:04:41;"And by that way, the coffee magically transfers over to me."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"Something like that."
01:04:43;01:04:44;"- You have to deputize somebody."
01:04:44;01:04:46;"Wait, Winter, I have an idea."
01:04:46;01:04:47;"I wonder if you'll find this appealing"
01:04:47;01:04:50;"as somebody who, you know, you like to make rules and stuff."
01:04:50;01:04:53;"We know that Winter was not your birth name,"
01:04:53;01:04:55;"but it is your legal name."
01:04:55;01:04:55;"- Yes."
01:04:55;01:04:58;"- What if you deputize somebody else,"
01:04:58;01:05:00;"but they have to legally change their name"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"to Winter or Winter Two?"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"I think that way it's not just like,"
01:05:04;01:05:08;"oh, I got a guy off Craigslist who said for 10 bucks,"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"he'd walk to the Starbucks and go,"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"it's somebody who's so committed to the project"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"that they become Winter Two."
01:05:14;01:05:15;"- It's not a bad idea."
01:05:15;01:05:18;"And to be honest, quite a number of people have emailed me"
01:05:18;01:05:20;"and said, hey, you need this store?"
01:05:20;01:05:22;"I'll go take a picture for you."
01:05:22;01:05:25;"But, you know, I think by now you all know me well enough"
01:05:25;01:05:28;"to know that there's a certain artistic integrity"
01:05:28;01:05:31;"to the project that can't be violated."
01:05:31;01:05:36;"In fact, the next chapter that I will probably write"
01:05:36;01:05:37;"will be a lighter one,"
01:05:37;01:05:40;"just going over the rules of Starbucks."
01:05:40;01:05:43;"So, you know, people will understand"
01:05:43;01:05:45;"why it has to be me going in"
01:05:45;01:05:46;"and why I have to drink the coffee"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"and this detail or that detail."
01:05:48;01:05:51;"- That's gonna be important for the whole community too,"
01:05:51;01:05:54;"because I think so many people are curious about Starbucks"
01:05:54;01:05:57;"and interested in your story and following it."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"And probably some of them, you know,"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"you've talked about people who were inspired by you"
01:06:00;01:06:01;"to do it themselves."
01:06:01;01:06:06;"But I think having a clear cut set of rules from the OG"
01:06:06;01:06:10;"will really be important for like building the movement."
01:06:10;01:06:14;"- Well, yes, or for understanding the movement,"
01:06:14;01:06:18;"but I do not want people to feel"
01:06:18;01:06:20;"that the rules that I am following"
01:06:20;01:06:22;"are the rules that they're following."
01:06:22;01:06:24;"I think that at some point"
01:06:24;01:06:27;"you should try to get Sebastian on the show"
01:06:27;01:06:31;"because he is the second most prolific Starbucker"
01:06:31;01:06:34;"with over 3000 stores under his belt."
01:06:34;01:06:35;"He's the German kid."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"- Okay. - He follows different rules."
01:06:37;01:06:40;"He goes to the licensed stores, the franchise stores."
01:06:40;01:06:44;"He doesn't require himself to drink a coffee from each one,"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"but he does require that the store be open"
01:06:46;01:06:47;"so he can go inside."
01:06:47;01:06:50;"So sometimes he's gotten to a store, it's been closed."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"He doesn't count it."
01:06:51;01:06:52;"He has to go back later."
01:06:52;01:06:55;"If I have to give the fans like one heuristic"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"for how to do your own Starbucks is,"
01:06:57;01:07:01;"come up with rules that are not too simple."
01:07:01;01:07:04;"So it'll still be a challenge and stick to those rules."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"- You're very diplomatic Winter,"
01:07:06;01:07:09;"but just so everybody knows on ""Time Crisis"","
01:07:09;01:07:12;"we do only recognize Starbucking"
01:07:12;01:07:15;"as a person who adheres to the Winter set of rules."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"And again, you say what you want Winter, that's fine,"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"but just here at ""Time Crisis"","
01:07:19;01:07:22;"we do not designate somebody a Starbucker"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"unless they adhere to the Winter set of rules."
01:07:24;01:07:26;"We as a news organization"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"just have to draw the line somewhere."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"- You're the boss. - I'm sure you understand."
01:07:30;01:07:31;"- I understand."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"- Great to see you Winter."
01:07:33;01:07:34;"Have a great trip to Bolivia."
01:07:34;01:07:37;"I hope it all works out and you get to hit those six"
01:07:37;01:07:40;"and we'll catch you in 2021."
01:07:40;01:07:44;"- All right, well, 2021, will you still think about me?"
01:07:44;01:07:46;"- Oh, you know we'll be thinking about you."
01:07:46;01:07:48;"(both laughing)"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"All right, have a good one, man."
01:07:50;01:07:50;"- Take care."

01:08:21;01:08:23;"- Friend of the show, Winter."
01:08:23;01:08:25;"Absolute legend."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"Really hope things work out in Bolivia."
01:08:27;01:08:30;"So Jake, had you ever heard of Duck Donuts before?"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"- No, new to me."
01:08:31;01:08:34;"Smaller chain, under 100 locations."
01:08:34;01:08:38;"- That's still like a wild amount of locations."
01:08:38;01:08:41;"Once you get to 100, I feel like you're killing it."
01:08:41;01:08:42;"That's like a lot to manage."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"- Yeah, I was thinking about that,"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"like them expanding in the Southern California"
01:08:46;01:08:49;"and they have this pretty high standards of quality"
01:08:49;01:08:51;"that they need to maintain."
01:08:51;01:08:54;"Like, how do you just expand into a new region"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"and find the right people"
01:08:56;01:08:58;"that you can trust the guy?"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"Okay, I'm hiring you as the store manager"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"for the Santa Ana location."
01:09:02;01:09:06;"And I'm gonna train you, but I don't really know you."
01:09:06;01:09:08;"Are we good here?"
01:09:08;01:09:08;"Can you handle this?"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"- No, I think that's that (beep)"
01:09:10;01:09:13;"where it's like, probably it's a lot of"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"North Carolina transplants."
01:09:15;01:09:16;"You don't just set it up."
01:09:16;01:09:21;"It's just like, all right, Buck, you're moving to SoCal."
01:09:21;01:09:22;"Maybe you could come back in five years,"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"but you have a mission."
01:09:24;01:09:27;"You're the Southern California station chief"
01:09:27;01:09:28;"and you're gonna run our operations there."
01:09:28;01:09:30;"And we have very specific objectives."
01:09:30;01:09:32;"Get it done, man."
01:09:32;01:09:34;"Well, let's keep things moving."
01:09:34;01:09:37;"Let's get other friend of the show, Rashida Jones,"
01:09:37;01:09:41;"for her 10th appearance on the program."
01:09:41;01:09:44;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:09:44;01:09:46;"(phone ringing)"
01:09:46;01:09:50;"- Rashida Jones, welcome back to the program"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"for your 10th appearance."
01:09:52;01:09:53;"- Thank you for having me."
01:09:53;01:09:57;"- Yeah, what a landmark moment for all of us, really."
01:09:57;01:09:59;"- We're in different parts of the house."
01:09:59;01:10:02;"- I was wondering about that."
01:10:02;01:10:03;"- Well, yeah, 'cause what else are we gonna do?"
01:10:03;01:10:04;"Like share earbuds?"
01:10:04;01:10:07;"- We've done that too, by the way."
01:10:07;01:10:08;"- Oh yeah, well, I guess actually, Jake,"
01:10:08;01:10:11;"when you had Hannah on, you guys were just hanging."
01:10:11;01:10:12;"- Yeah, did you guys pick separate rooms?"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"- Wait, but Jake, you don't use headphones anymore, huh?"
01:10:14;01:10:17;"- No, I'm just screaming into a laptop."
01:10:17;01:10:19;"(laughing)"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"- Well."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"- You and the rest of the world."
01:10:22;01:10:23;"- Yeah."
01:10:23;01:10:25;"- I think it's good this way."
01:10:25;01:10:28;"First question, Rashida, have you ever heard of Duck Donuts?"
01:10:28;01:10:31;"- Duck Donuts, is it a donut?"
01:10:31;01:10:34;"- It's a donut chain, roughly 100 locations in the US."
01:10:34;01:10:36;"- What, what?"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"Is it like a regional heavy or something?"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"- It's from North Carolina,"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"but there's a couple in Southern California,"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"'cause we just had winter on, you know,"
01:10:44;01:10:44;"the Starbucks thing?"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:10:46;01:10:48;"- And so he's also really into Duck Donuts,"
01:10:48;01:10:51;"so he's been to basically every single one."
01:10:51;01:10:52;"I guess their whole thing is that"
01:10:52;01:10:55;"they make the donut on demand."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"So you like say what drizzle you want on it,"
01:10:57;01:11:00;"and it comes out piping hot of the machines."
01:11:00;01:11:01;"- Oh, that sounds incredible."
01:11:01;01:11:04;"He's gonna have to start star ducking."
01:11:04;01:11:06;"- Oh, (beep) should have thought of that."
01:11:06;01:11:07;"I mean, he is."
01:11:07;01:11:08;"- That's what I'm here for."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"- He basically is star ducking."
01:11:10;01:11:13;"Well, anyway, I had a thought before you came on,"
01:11:13;01:11:16;"Seinfeld was saying if you should get a special prize"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"for your 10th appearance on the program."
01:11:18;01:11:23;"And my idea is that Jake picks me up in his minivan,"
01:11:23;01:11:28;"and we rip down to Huntington Beach,"
01:11:28;01:11:29;"and bring back-"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"- This sounds like your prize so far, but okay."
01:11:31;01:11:34;"- Me and Jake rip down in the minivan."
01:11:34;01:11:35;"Wait, where did he say,"
01:11:35;01:11:38;"is the Huntington Beach the closest one?"
01:11:38;01:11:39;"Where's the other one?"
01:11:39;01:11:40;"He said Irvine?"
01:11:40;01:11:41;"- Irvine, all OC."
01:11:41;01:11:43;"- Maybe Irvine's cooler."
01:11:43;01:11:46;"Me and Jake get in the van, rip down to Irvine,"
01:11:46;01:11:49;"and bring back a piping hot duck donut,"
01:11:49;01:11:50;"any style that you want."
01:11:50;01:11:52;"We'll get one for Hannah too."
01:11:52;01:11:54;"- How many is a baker's dozen?"
01:11:54;01:11:55;"- 13. - 13."
01:11:55;01:11:56;"- Oh, 13, okay."
01:11:56;01:11:58;"So it should be like a Rashida dozen,"
01:11:58;01:12:01;"it should just be 10 for every appearance."
01:12:01;01:12:02;"- Yeah."
01:12:02;01:12:04;"Although we asked Winner that apparently,"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"if you wanna get like a big batch for like,"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"you know, the office breakfast or something."
01:12:08;01:12:09;"- It takes like four hours?"
01:12:09;01:12:12;"- Basically, they have to still make them one at a time."
01:12:12;01:12:13;"All right."
01:12:13;01:12:16;"Me and Jake are gonna rip back to LA,"
01:12:16;01:12:19;"with 10, you can have two, Hannah can have two."
01:12:19;01:12:21;"- As the sun goes down."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"- Yeah."
01:12:22;01:12:25;"Just an all day star ducking trip."
01:12:25;01:12:28;"- This is like a very romantic Jack Kerouac road trip."
01:12:28;01:12:31;"(laughing)"
01:12:31;01:12:32;"But we get the hot donuts,"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"by the time we get back to LA, they're-"
01:12:34;01:12:35;"- That's what I was gonna say,"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"this is a bum deal because there's no way,"
01:12:37;01:12:39;"there's no universe in which you two"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"don't get your own donuts."
01:12:41;01:12:44;"And just by the sheer fact that you're gonna be there,"
01:12:44;01:12:47;"you're getting the best, freshest vibe."
01:12:47;01:12:48;"- Well, hold on."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"Jake, when you worked at Papa John's,"
01:12:50;01:12:53;"what was the tech like for keeping the pizzas hot?"
01:12:53;01:12:53;"(laughing)"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"- Yeah, you have like a thermal,"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"there's like a thermal bag."
01:12:57;01:12:59;"- Oh, I'll lace you with a thermal bag."
01:12:59;01:13:02;"And then I'll get you a pizza bag."
01:13:02;01:13:03;"- Yeah."
01:13:03;01:13:04;"- We'll stick the ducks in there."
01:13:04;01:13:06;"- I bet there's even like high end ones"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"where you can plug into the cigarette lighter."
01:13:08;01:13:11;"- Oh, that's a great Christmas present."
01:13:11;01:13:13;"If you can source that."
01:13:13;01:13:14;"- I would love that."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"'Cause I have that for like a coffee cup."
01:13:17;01:13:18;"You plug it in the lighter."
01:13:18;01:13:19;"So cool. - Oh, really?"
01:13:19;01:13:20;"- Yeah. - Really?"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"And it keeps the coffee hot?"
01:13:22;01:13:23;"- I'm really not trying to brag,"
01:13:23;01:13:26;"but I did get it at the East Wing gift shop"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"at the White House like a decade ago."
01:13:28;01:13:32;"- Oh, that time when you were visiting Donald and Melania."
01:13:32;01:13:34;"(laughing)"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"- You brought- - 10 years ago?"
01:13:36;01:13:37;"(laughing)"
01:13:37;01:13:38;"- No, that was two years ago."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"- I laughed too hard."
01:13:40;01:13:40;"- It was two years ago,"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"you don't have to cover up."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"- You didn't have to share friends, Donald and Melania?"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"- Well, first things first,"
01:13:46;01:13:49;"you got new film out there, ""On the Rocks."""
01:13:49;01:13:51;"It's gonna be very difficult for me"
01:13:51;01:13:52;"to ask any questions about it"
01:13:52;01:13:56;"because I've been watching you do press for a few months."
01:13:56;01:13:58;"- Cool."
01:13:58;01:13:59;"All right, nice to see you guys."
01:13:59;01:14:01;"- I'll say that- - The interview's over."
01:14:01;01:14:03;"- Yeah, maybe Jake should take over."
01:14:03;01:14:07;"- Hannah and I drove out to the Drive-In Movie Theater"
01:14:07;01:14:10;"in City of Industry, California,"
01:14:10;01:14:14;"and watched ""On the Rocks"" at a drive-in"
01:14:14;01:14:17;"with probably like 50 other cars, it was pretty packed."
01:14:17;01:14:19;"People were psyched to see it."
01:14:19;01:14:21;"We had a great time at the movies that night."
01:14:21;01:14:22;"- That's awesome."
01:14:22;01:14:24;"- It was a really fun movie."
01:14:24;01:14:24;"Now I feel like I'm on the spot."
01:14:24;01:14:26;"I don't have any cool questions, but-"
01:14:26;01:14:29;"- Well, the actual premiere was also at a drive-in,"
01:14:29;01:14:30;"I don't know if you know that."
01:14:30;01:14:31;"- Oh, where was that?"
01:14:31;01:14:34;"- In New York at the, what is it,"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"the Queen's Science Hall?"
01:14:36;01:14:37;"Is that what it's called?"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"Hall of Science?"
01:14:39;01:14:40;"- Yeah, that sounds right."
01:14:40;01:14:41;"- That's right."
01:14:41;01:14:42;"- Yeah, by the end of the World's Fair."
01:14:42;01:14:43;"- Was it pretty strict?"
01:14:43;01:14:44;"Everyone stayed in their cars or?"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"- It was very strict, yeah."
01:14:46;01:14:48;"We were allowed to get out and talk"
01:14:48;01:14:51;"to like the organizer with masks,"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"and then we had to get back into our cars,"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"and everybody had to stay in their cars."
01:14:55;01:14:56;"But you know what I really liked about the,"
01:14:56;01:14:59;"I've never been to a drive-in, I know that's crazy,"
01:14:59;01:15:00;"but I'd never been to a drive-in."
01:15:00;01:15:03;"I like that people, 'cause you can't applaud,"
01:15:03;01:15:06;"so I like honking as a substitute for applause."
01:15:06;01:15:08;"I thought that was so cool."
01:15:08;01:15:11;"- Then you're just like waving to Sophia Coppola"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"and Bill Murray in their cars?"
01:15:13;01:15:16;"- Oh, we actually, we were all in the same car."
01:15:16;01:15:18;"We got tested and we came together."
01:15:18;01:15:22;"Sophia and her husband and me and Bill were in one car,"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"which was fun because Bill hadn't really seen the movie,"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"and Sophia and I were just gabbing,"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"and he very much wanted us to be quiet"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"'cause he really wanted to watch it"
01:15:30;01:15:31;"'cause he hadn't seen it yet."
01:15:31;01:15:32;"Yeah."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"- Right, 'cause Sophia had seen it a million times."
01:15:34;01:15:36;"He'd probably seen it four or five times,"
01:15:36;01:15:37;"something like that."
01:15:37;01:15:38;"- Yeah."
01:15:38;01:15:39;"- That's wild that you were watching with him"
01:15:39;01:15:41;"for the first time."
01:15:41;01:15:42;"- I thought it looked great."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"I thought you were both really great."
01:15:44;01:15:48;"I loved the whole vibe between you two"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"in these fancy SoHo places."
01:15:50;01:15:53;"It made me miss being like, oh, damn."
01:15:53;01:15:54;"- I know."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"- Going out to a restaurant in New York."
01:15:56;01:15:57;"- I know."
01:15:57;01:16:00;"It was kind of an unintentional,"
01:16:00;01:16:03;"oh, bit for whatever version of New York that was,"
01:16:03;01:16:06;"but it will be slightly different when we, you know?"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"- Yeah, you were just saying the other day"
01:16:08;01:16:11;"how one of the classic New York restaurants"
01:16:11;01:16:12;"that you guys go to in the movie,"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"the 21 Club, just announced its closing,"
01:16:14;01:16:15;"which is crazy."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"- Yeah, it was crazy."
01:16:16;01:16:17;"- Been there forever."
01:16:17;01:16:20;"- That's the restaurant where we go."
01:16:20;01:16:23;"We were sitting at Bogart and Bacall's table."
01:16:23;01:16:24;"I don't know if that made it in the movie,"
01:16:24;01:16:26;"but he tells me a story about how,"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"I think he proposed to her or something there,"
01:16:28;01:16:31;"but anyway, it's a real historic place,"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"and yeah, just gone."
01:16:33;01:16:35;"- Well, everybody should see ""On the Rocks,"""
01:16:35;01:16:38;"great movie, Sophia Coppola directed it."
01:16:38;01:16:40;"Yeah, it's streaming on Apple."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"Real Apple household."
01:16:42;01:16:44;"- I have a question about Bill Murray."
01:16:44;01:16:45;"Had you met him before?"
01:16:45;01:16:47;"- Yes, we're friends."
01:16:47;01:16:48;"I think we're friends, yeah."
01:16:48;01:16:50;"- Okay, 'cause I think of him,"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"he has so many iconic roles over the years,"
01:16:52;01:16:55;"and I wouldn't be able to help myself"
01:16:55;01:16:58;"asking about ""Ghostbusters."""
01:16:58;01:17:01;"In a situation like that, do you have that urge?"
01:17:01;01:17:03;"- Of course I do, yeah."
01:17:03;01:17:04;"- Do you not do it?"
01:17:04;01:17:05;"Or do you do it? - No, yeah."
01:17:05;01:17:08;"No, I don't do it, 'cause I was trying to play cool."
01:17:08;01:17:11;"Also, we spent so much time together"
01:17:11;01:17:14;"that he will just volunteer stories,"
01:17:14;01:17:17;"and that's the best way to get those stories anyway."
01:17:17;01:17:19;"- Right, right."
01:17:19;01:17:22;"- And then you'll get stories that you didn't even ask for,"
01:17:22;01:17:27;"you didn't think all of a sudden you care."
01:17:27;01:17:32;"He told me the story about how he became Garfield,"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"which I didn't know, but I guess,"
01:17:34;01:17:35;"some people know the story already,"
01:17:35;01:17:40;"but he was sent this offer to play the voice of Garfield"
01:17:40;01:17:43;"and was told that Joel Cohen was the director,"
01:17:43;01:17:47;"and he was like, ""Yeah, Coen Brothers Garfield, yes,"""
01:17:47;01:17:50;"and showed up to the studio that day"
01:17:50;01:17:55;"and met Joel Cohen, the director of Garfield,"
01:17:55;01:17:59;"not Joel Cohen without an H, and he doesn't belong here,"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"so I guess we're just gonna do it."
01:18:01;01:18:03;"- He just felt too awkward at that point."
01:18:03;01:18:07;"- So he thought he was in a Coen Brothers movie"
01:18:07;01:18:12;"and then never talked to them before showing up to-"
01:18:12;01:18:15;"- That's very him."
01:18:15;01:18:18;"Like, he did an episode of Angie Trabeka,"
01:18:18;01:18:21;"and after he said yes, it was very touch and go"
01:18:21;01:18:23;"about whether or not he was gonna show up,"
01:18:23;01:18:26;"and he called me and told me what JetBlue flight"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"he wanted to be on, and then was,"
01:18:29;01:18:32;"somebody will come get me, and we're like, ""Yeah, you,"""
01:18:32;01:18:34;"but it was not until the day before"
01:18:34;01:18:37;"that I really thought that he was gonna show up."
01:18:37;01:18:40;"You know, he's infamously, he has no age to enter-"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"- He doesn't have a phone, for some reason?"
01:18:42;01:18:45;"- He has a phone, but he doesn't really answer that much."
01:18:45;01:18:47;"When I first met Sophia, I met Sophia,"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"I was in an acting workshop,"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"and she was workshopping ""Lost in Translation,"""
01:18:51;01:18:54;"and I was playing the Scarlett Johansson part,"
01:18:54;01:18:56;"and another actor's playing the Bill part."
01:18:56;01:18:59;"We were working on it all day long for a month,"
01:18:59;01:19:02;"and there was a dedicated intern who was hired"
01:19:02;01:19:06;"to sit outside our sessions and wait for Bill to call."
01:19:06;01:19:09;"They just had the phone in their hand,"
01:19:09;01:19:10;"waiting for him to call."
01:19:10;01:19:12;"- Wow. - Just 'cause if they missed it,"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"that was that. - Yeah."
01:19:14;01:19:17;"- Considering all the Garfield talk lately,"
01:19:17;01:19:19;"with Garfield Eats, the restaurant"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"that recently closed in Toronto,"
01:19:21;01:19:25;"have you ever seen the Bill Murray Garfield movie?"
01:19:25;01:19:27;"- No, I haven't, but I should,"
01:19:27;01:19:29;"'cause I'm a huge Garfield fan."
01:19:29;01:19:30;"- And a Bill Murray fan."
01:19:30;01:19:32;"All right, let's watch that tonight."
01:19:32;01:19:33;"- All right. - That's what I proposed"
01:19:33;01:19:36;"for your 10th episode party,"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"is we're gonna watch the Garfield movie."
01:19:38;01:19:40;"- You guys are wilding out."
01:19:40;01:19:43;"- Getting real wild. - Deep into quarantine."
01:19:43;01:19:45;"- Maybe it's time to get into some music talk."
01:19:45;01:19:47;"- Totally. - Just 'cause I wasn't"
01:19:47;01:19:49;"totally sure we were gonna talk about,"
01:19:49;01:19:51;"threw out some ideas to you, Rashida,"
01:19:51;01:19:55;"one of which was, you should listen to ""Europe 72."""
01:19:55;01:19:56;"Did you listen to it?"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"- I listened to some of it, yeah."
01:19:58;01:19:59;"- How far did you get?"
01:19:59;01:20:00;"- I got to, what's my song?"
01:20:00;01:20:03;"It's my favorite ""Grateful Dead"" song."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"- Oh, ""China Cat Sunflower."" - One more Saturday night."
01:20:05;01:20:09;"- Yeah, no, no, Ezra's right."
01:20:09;01:20:10;"Wait, what's it called, Ezra?"
01:20:10;01:20:12;"- ""China Cat Sunflower."""
01:20:12;01:20:14;"- ""China Cat Sunflower,"" yeah."
01:20:14;01:20:15;"- And it was like, that's when I was like,"
01:20:15;01:20:19;"""Oh, my jam,"" and like, ""Oh, it actually is my jam."""
01:20:19;01:20:21;"So I probably didn't get very far, right?"
01:20:21;01:20:24;"- That's like maybe six songs in or something."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"- Yeah."
01:20:25;01:20:28;"- Oh, but that's cool, 'cause actually,"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"I'm sure we've had many versions of this conversation"
01:20:30;01:20:32;"in person, but I did kind of want to remember,"
01:20:32;01:20:35;"like, what is your relationship to ""The Grateful Dead""?"
01:20:35;01:20:38;"(laughing)"
01:20:38;01:20:41;"- Every guest on this show, Ezra's like,"
01:20:41;01:20:42;"""Look, what is your relationship?"""
01:20:42;01:20:44;"- I know ""The Grateful Dead,"" I know Tom Cruise,"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"I know Rashida, I know there's not a ton"
01:20:46;01:20:48;"of Rashida dead content out there,"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"so let's set the record straight."
01:20:50;01:20:53;"- You're right, this is an exclusive."
01:20:53;01:20:57;"- I remember my first, you're gonna think this is crazy,"
01:20:57;01:21:00;"but my first exposure, because as you know very well,"
01:21:00;01:21:03;"I was raised on R&B and jazz and hip hop,"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"and like, you know, a little bit of Steely Dan"
01:21:05;01:21:09;"and Doobie Brothers, that hit that they had,"
01:21:09;01:21:10;"that had a video."
01:21:10;01:21:11;"- Oh, ""Touch of Gray."""
01:21:11;01:21:14;"- ""Touch of Gray,"" that was the first time I,"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"like, I was like, ""Oh, I know that they're like a band."""
01:21:16;01:21:20;"I was like, ""Really big, not in this era."
01:21:20;01:21:22;"I don't understand what's happening."""
01:21:22;01:21:23;"But I like, the song is catchy,"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"and I remember some of the H1 a lot."
01:21:25;01:21:26;"- Sure."
01:21:26;01:21:27;"- Great song."
01:21:27;01:21:28;"- Great song."
01:21:28;01:21:29;"- Great song, fun video."
01:21:29;01:21:31;"- There's some phases that Ezra goes through"
01:21:31;01:21:34;"where I'm like, ""I can't wait for this to be over."""
01:21:34;01:21:37;"His love of the dead, we'll get into that,"
01:21:37;01:21:42;"but I'm very, very supportive because it is dynamic,"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"and the musicianship is very good,"
01:21:44;01:21:46;"and the live performances are really good,"
01:21:46;01:21:50;"and I, Jerry's just like, he's very soulful."
01:21:50;01:21:51;"He's a very soulful person,"
01:21:51;01:21:53;"even if his voice, he's not like, you know,"
01:21:53;01:21:55;"he's not an opera singer,"
01:21:55;01:21:58;"but he just brings, like, meaning and honesty"
01:21:58;01:21:59;"in the way that he sings."
01:21:59;01:22:02;"So I'm always down to watch him."
01:22:02;01:22:04;"- I'll also say, 'cause you might not remember,"
01:22:04;01:22:07;"but I've noticed that you've always flagged"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"""China Cat Sunflower"" as your favorite,"
01:22:09;01:22:10;"and I'm pretty sure your other favorite,"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"'cause I've just noticed you ask a lot,"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"like, if you're listening to an instrumental version of it,"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"like, you perk up a little bit,"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"or you're like, ""Wait, is this the dead?"""
01:22:18;01:22:20;"You always say that about ""Eyes of the World."""
01:22:20;01:22:21;"Do you remember that one?"
01:22:21;01:22:24;"It's kind of like, throw on ""Eyes of the World."""
01:22:24;01:22:27;"Jake, how many times has Richard Pictures played?"
01:22:27;01:22:28;"- Oh, yeah."
01:22:28;01:22:29;"- 17."
01:22:29;01:22:30;"- Really?"
01:22:30;01:22:33;"- No, just making that, but yeah, it's a classic."
01:22:33;01:22:38;"♪ Saddest, sleazy summer home ♪"
01:22:39;01:22:41;"(Jake vocalizing)"
01:22:41;01:22:43;"- Yeah, I like the song."
01:22:43;01:22:44;"Yeah."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"This is a jam."
01:22:46;01:22:47;"- It's such a unique song,"
01:22:47;01:22:50;"like, very little truly sounds like it,"
01:22:50;01:22:51;"even within the dead catalog."
01:22:51;01:22:55;"♪ Right outside the lazy gate ♪"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"- First time in the media,"
01:22:57;01:23:01;"Rashida Jones, top two, ""Grateful Dead"" songs."
01:23:01;01:23:03;"- It's gonna be a headline, you guys."
01:23:03;01:23:04;"People are dying for this content."
01:23:04;01:23:07;"- Look, if any of our friends at Relix are listening to this,"
01:23:07;01:23:11;"'cause we got some press when we had ""We're On"" recently."
01:23:11;01:23:12;"- Right."
01:23:12;01:23:14;"- That made some of the jam band outlets,"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"you know, maybe just like a little thing."
01:23:18;01:23:20;"♪ Wake up to find out ♪"
01:23:20;01:23:25;"♪ That you are the eyes of the world ♪"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"- Well, maybe we should just get into the main event,"
01:23:27;01:23:29;"'cause I think we got a pretty fun one planned."
01:23:29;01:23:31;"And actually, Rashida, we changed the concept a little bit"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"from when I first pitched it to you."
01:23:33;01:23:36;"Not to put you two on the spot, but basically this."
01:23:36;01:23:38;"So you've been on the show before talking about"
01:23:38;01:23:43;"that you were raised and always been a big fan,"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"especially in your teen years of R&B,"
01:23:45;01:23:48;"'90s R&B and hip hop, especially."
01:23:48;01:23:52;"Now, you and Jake are both Gen X."
01:23:52;01:23:54;"In fact, I will say, I was thinking about it"
01:23:54;01:23:59;"where I'm like, man, Rashida's Gen X, Jake is Gen X,"
01:23:59;01:24:02;"see Ariel Rekshad, producer's Gen X."
01:24:02;01:24:04;"I was like, you know, I really (beep) with Gen X."
01:24:04;01:24:07;"Even though I'm, (laughs)"
01:24:07;01:24:10;"even though I'm a silverback millennial."
01:24:10;01:24:13;"But anyway, so often when we do the top five,"
01:24:13;01:24:17;"we'll compare top five songs from now and back then."
01:24:17;01:24:19;"So we were gonna maybe do, in honor of you,"
01:24:19;01:24:24;"we were gonna do the 1992 Billboard Hot R&B/Hip Hop Songs"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"chart and compare it to 2020."
01:24:26;01:24:29;"And then I started thinking, I'm gonna be moderating,"
01:24:29;01:24:33;"you know, two iconic Gen Xers in my own life."
01:24:33;01:24:38;"One who loves R&B and one who loves rock."
01:24:38;01:24:40;"So I thought this is actually a perfect opportunity"
01:24:40;01:24:43;"for us to compare and contrast the top five"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"Hot R&B/Hip Hop Songs."
01:24:45;01:24:47;"'Cause back then there wasn't just an R&B chart,"
01:24:47;01:24:50;"by the way, it was called the R&B/Hip Hop."
01:24:50;01:24:53;"- Right. - With the 1992,"
01:24:53;01:24:56;"same week, Billboard Modern Rock Tracks."
01:24:56;01:24:57;"- Sick. - So basically,"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"- Awesome. - We're having Rashida"
01:24:59;01:25:02;"versus Jake, or it doesn't have to be competitive."
01:25:02;01:25:05;"It's just the Gen X Town Hall, 1992."
01:25:05;01:25:08;"- I know we should do, we should make it competitive"
01:25:08;01:25:13;"and we should see how many Jake get of the top five"
01:25:13;01:25:16;"and how many I can get of the top five of our own genres."
01:25:16;01:25:18;"- How do you mean like-- - You know, like five questions."
01:25:18;01:25:20;"- How quickly you can recognize it."
01:25:20;01:25:22;"- Yeah, like a name that tune."
01:25:22;01:25:24;"- Okay, so we won't announce it."
01:25:24;01:25:26;"- Right, we won't announce it, but I will,"
01:25:26;01:25:29;"I'm gonna do like a cutoff at like, you know, 30 seconds."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"Like if you can't get it by that--"
01:25:31;01:25:32;"- If we can't get it by 30 seconds,"
01:25:32;01:25:34;"we shouldn't be considered Gen X."
01:25:34;01:25:36;"- 92? - Well, okay, let's see."
01:25:36;01:25:37;"Let's see. - Okay."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"- Just remember, this is the top five"
01:25:38;01:25:41;"of this random week, December 1992."
01:25:41;01:25:43;"- Okay, all right. - This is not the top five hits"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"of the year or anything like that."
01:25:44;01:25:46;"- I know, but Jake and I were definitely listening"
01:25:46;01:25:49;"to the radio a lot in '92, right?"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"- Absolutely. - I was like on the radio,"
01:25:51;01:25:54;"like all the time. - Right, so 1992,"
01:25:54;01:25:56;"and also just to really paint a picture for everybody,"
01:25:56;01:25:59;"1992, Rashida, you're 16."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"- Wearing a mustard Gap hoodie."
01:26:01;01:26:03;"- Living in Los Angeles. - Yep."
01:26:03;01:26:07;"- Jake, you're 15. - Yep."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"- In Connecticut."
01:26:09;01:26:11;"- Wearing an L.L. Bean polar fleece."
01:26:11;01:26:15;"- All right, the scene has been set."
01:26:15;01:26:18;"- This is like some freaky Friday (beep), yeah, okay."
01:26:18;01:26:20;"(laughing)"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"- The scene has officially been set."
01:26:23;01:26:28;"- It's time for the top five, five on iTunes."
01:26:28;01:26:31;"- So this is the number five song"
01:26:31;01:26:35;"on the R&B/hip hop charts this week in '92."
01:26:35;01:26:36;"Let's kick it off."
01:26:36;01:26:38;"- Stop, stop, I got it."
01:26:38;01:26:40;"Portrait, here we go again."
01:26:41;01:26:42;"- That is correct. - Portrait."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"- Portrait, here we go again."
01:26:44;01:26:46;"Wait, the artist is named Portrait?"
01:26:46;01:26:49;"- Yeah, I've seen them live."
01:26:49;01:26:49;"- Really?"
01:26:49;01:26:52;"So Portrait's like, it's a group."
01:26:52;01:26:58;"♪ Here we go ♪"
01:26:58;01:27:01;"♪ Here we go again ♪"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"- I like the long intro."
01:27:03;01:27:04;"- Very long."
01:27:04;01:27:09;"The chords are good on this song."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"- Yeah, it's kind of familiar."
01:27:13;01:27:19;"- Where did you see Portrait play?"
01:27:19;01:27:22;"- I actually saw them play at like a throwback party."
01:27:22;01:27:25;"- Like what year?"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"- Like 10 years ago."
01:27:27;01:27:28;"- I see."
01:27:28;01:27:29;"- Yeah."
01:27:29;01:27:32;"- That's a pretty cool name for a band, Portrait."
01:27:32;01:27:35;"- Yeah, Portrait could easily be an indie rock band too."
01:27:35;01:27:38;"- Or like a weird '70s like psych band."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"- Oh yeah."
01:27:39;01:27:41;"- Like in a frame."
01:27:41;01:27:42;"- Oh yeah."
01:27:42;01:27:43;"- Album in a frame."
01:27:43;01:27:45;"- Oh yeah, you can picture the cover."
01:27:45;01:27:46;"- Yeah, this is very classic."
01:27:46;01:27:48;"- I don't think I know this song."
01:27:48;01:27:51;"- For anybody who liked R&B in the '90s,"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"you know this song."
01:27:53;01:27:54;"You just know it."
01:27:54;01:27:56;"- And Portrait had other hits?"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"They were like a big group?"
01:27:58;01:27:58;"- No."
01:27:58;01:28:00;"- This is the one."
01:28:00;01:28:01;"- Yeah."
01:28:01;01:28:02;"I really liked this song."
01:28:02;01:28:04;"I think I might've had a good single."
01:28:04;01:28:07;"- I'm trying to think like 1992,"
01:28:07;01:28:10;"like I was definitely watching a lot of MTV,"
01:28:10;01:28:12;"but I don't know what my radio diet was like."
01:28:12;01:28:14;"I feel like it was probably like,"
01:28:14;01:28:16;"honestly like the oldies station"
01:28:16;01:28:19;"and like the classic rock station."
01:28:19;01:28:20;"- Yeah."
01:28:20;01:28:22;"- And I don't know if I was listening to like--"
01:28:22;01:28:24;"- He's making excuses already."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"That's the big one."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"If you weren't driving,"
01:28:26;01:28:28;"if you weren't driving to school,"
01:28:28;01:28:30;"then you get it, it's gonna be hard."
01:28:30;01:28:33;"- I wasn't even in cars that much to be honest."
01:28:33;01:28:36;"Like I was taking the school bus to and from school."
01:28:36;01:28:37;"- Right."
01:28:37;01:28:39;"- Then maybe like my mom would drive me to like,"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"I don't know, my buddy's house,"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"or I'd go to the grocery store with my mom."
01:28:43;01:28:44;"It's like a five minute drive."
01:28:44;01:28:45;"Like I really,"
01:28:45;01:28:49;"I bet my car time in '92 was pretty limited."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"And therefore my radio time was pretty limited."
01:28:51;01:28:53;"- I have faith in you."
01:28:53;01:28:54;"'Cause I just feel like you know a lot of music."
01:28:54;01:28:56;"- The only place where you might've caught it, Jake,"
01:28:56;01:28:57;"I'm looking at the notes,"
01:28:57;01:29:00;"is it says that Portrait performed this song"
01:29:00;01:29:02;"on an episode of ""Family Matters."""
01:29:02;01:29:03;"- I did watch that show."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"- Oh my God, really?"
01:29:05;01:29:06;"- Yeah."
01:29:06;01:29:07;"- I did not know that."
01:29:07;01:29:09;"- So Jake, you can't look at the notes by the way."
01:29:09;01:29:10;"- I'm not looking at the notes."
01:29:10;01:29:12;"I'm doing full screen FaceTime."
01:29:12;01:29:13;"- Okay, great."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"So this is, I'm curious about this."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"All right, the number five song"
01:29:17;01:29:19;"on the Modern Rock chart this week in '92."
01:29:22;01:29:22;"- Okay."
01:29:22;01:29:25;"Yeah, I got it."
01:29:25;01:29:25;"- Really?"
01:29:25;01:29:26;"- What is it?"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"- I know the artist, it's REM."
01:29:28;01:29:29;"- Okay."
01:29:29;01:29:32;"- Oh, it's Ignore Land."
01:29:32;01:29:33;"- Whoa, okay."
01:29:33;01:29:34;"- Wow."
01:29:34;01:29:35;"Wow."
01:29:35;01:29:38;"- Like definitely don't know the song at all."
01:29:38;01:29:40;"Never heard it."
01:29:40;01:29:42;"- It's not a big REM song."
01:29:42;01:29:44;"- I didn't know it was a single."
01:29:44;01:29:46;"I know the song 'cause I love this record."
01:29:46;01:29:47;"It's automatic for the people."
01:29:47;01:29:48;"- Right, yeah."
01:29:48;01:29:50;"- What, automatic for people?"
01:29:50;01:29:51;"Well, yeah, I feel like an album,"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"but I didn't go deep on it."
01:29:53;01:29:56;"- Wait, Ezra, what chart is this listening to?"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"- This is the Modern Rock chart."
01:29:58;01:29:59;"- So maybe it was like a late--"
01:29:59;01:30:00;"- That's not a chart they have anymore, right?"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"- Maybe this was like a late single."
01:30:02;01:30:04;"- What I was gonna say was like,"
01:30:04;01:30:09;"I think in like '90, in my town where I grew up in '94,"
01:30:09;01:30:12;"I wanna say '94, which I was driving by that point,"
01:30:12;01:30:16;"there was like an old rock station, syndicated of course,"
01:30:16;01:30:18;"you know, part of a big corporation"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"that started in Connecticut."
01:30:20;01:30:23;"Well, that changed the radio landscape."
01:30:23;01:30:24;"- Right."
01:30:24;01:30:26;"- But '92 was like a very weird pocket for me."
01:30:26;01:30:27;"So it's like--"
01:30:27;01:30:28;"- You're a junior?"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"Were you a junior, sophomore?"
01:30:30;01:30:31;"- Probably sophomore."
01:30:32;01:30:34;"Yeah, I graduated in '95, so."
01:30:34;01:30:39;"I think my peak familiarity with R&B and hip hop radio"
01:30:39;01:30:42;"would be like late '90s, early 2000s."
01:30:42;01:30:45;"That'd be like my peak of familiarity."
01:30:45;01:30:46;"- Wait, Richie, did you say"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"that you owned Automatic for the People?"
01:30:48;01:30:49;"- I did."
01:30:49;01:30:51;"That's because, weren't they on Warner Brothers?"
01:30:51;01:30:52;"Were they on Warner Brothers?"
01:30:52;01:30:54;"- I couldn't tell you, probably."
01:30:54;01:30:56;"- 'Cause I was like an intern,"
01:30:56;01:30:58;"summer after, and they would like--"
01:30:58;01:30:59;"- Oh, wow."
01:30:59;01:31:00;"- Lace me with some CDs."
01:31:00;01:31:02;"- And you would throw it on?"
01:31:02;01:31:03;"It didn't get you more curious"
01:31:03;01:31:07;"and kind of a Southern indie rock?"
01:31:07;01:31:08;"- I loved Green."
01:31:08;01:31:10;"Is that the name of the album? - Green."
01:31:10;01:31:11;"- Yeah. - Yeah, yeah."
01:31:11;01:31:13;"- That I was very into."
01:31:13;01:31:15;"That was like one of my first CDs ever,"
01:31:15;01:31:18;"like when the Walkman CD came out."
01:31:18;01:31:20;"That was like my Christmas present was that,"

01:37:13;01:37:15;"- Oh yeah, it's the same label."
01:37:15;01:37:17;"Rasheeda, you ever listened to the replacements?"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"- No, I feel like I've heard them referenced so much"
01:37:19;01:37:23;"and I have no, I don't know anything."
01:37:23;01:37:25;"Why did I think they were like, Irish?"
01:37:25;01:37:28;"Is there a fan of them?"
01:37:28;01:37:29;"- The Pretenders?"
01:37:29;01:37:30;"- No."
01:37:30;01:37:34;"- Wait, wasn't there a movie, The Commitments?"
01:37:34;01:37:36;"- That's probably what I'm thinking of, yes."
01:37:36;01:37:38;"Literally."
01:37:38;01:37:39;"I see everything in movies, not in music."
01:37:39;01:37:41;"- I can see that, though,"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"thinking the replacements were Irish."
01:37:43;01:37:44;"- Do they have that vibe?"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"- They're drunken Midwesterners, so yes."
01:37:46;01:37:47;"- Right."
01:37:47;01:37:48;"- It's not that far off."
01:37:48;01:37:51;"- The replacements are great and I do feel like"
01:37:51;01:37:54;"there's some kind of like, classic alternative bands"
01:37:54;01:37:56;"that it's like, if you don't buy into the whole concept"
01:37:56;01:37:59;"of like, indie or alternative music, it's tough."
01:37:59;01:38:04;"But I think the five best replacement songs,"
01:38:04;01:38:06;"you could play for like, anybody,"
01:38:06;01:38:08;"whatever genre they're interested in."
01:38:08;01:38:09;"- Unsatisfied?"
01:38:09;01:38:13;"- Unsatisfied, Androgynous,"
01:38:13;01:38:14;"beautiful song ahead of its time."
01:38:14;01:38:17;"Can't Hardly Wait, actually that movie,"
01:38:17;01:38:19;"Can't Hardly Wait is named after a replacement song."
01:38:19;01:38:21;"Bastards of Young, they got a lot of good ones."
01:38:21;01:38:22;"- Yeah."
01:38:22;01:38:23;"- Send me a playlist."
01:38:23;01:38:27;"- I will, we'll make you a replacements playlist."
01:38:27;01:38:31;"Number three on the R&B, oh, this one's too easy."
01:38:31;01:38:32;"All right, but go for it."
01:38:32;01:38:33;"Number three."
01:38:33;01:38:35;"Remember, Jake, you can steal."
01:38:35;01:38:36;"- Stop, just stop."
01:38:36;01:38:38;"No, stop, I got it."
01:38:38;01:38:39;"- Say it, you say it."
01:38:40;01:38:42;"- Do a zoom, boom, boom, boom, and a boom, boom."
01:38:42;01:38:47;"I'm trying to remember if it's Teddy Riley,"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"but it's Black, no, it's not Blackstreet."
01:38:49;01:38:50;"- Wait a minute."
01:38:50;01:38:52;"Don't pause it, keep it going."
01:38:52;01:38:53;"- Oh, why?"
01:38:53;01:38:54;"- Well, I don't know, let's listen to it."
01:38:54;01:38:55;"I wanna hear it."
01:38:55;01:38:57;"I definitely know the song."
01:38:57;01:38:59;"- Rub Shaker."
01:38:59;01:39:01;"- Right, but it's not Blackstreet, it's from before."
01:39:01;01:39:03;"- It's Teddy Riley."
01:39:03;01:39:04;"- He produced it and wrote it,"
01:39:04;01:39:06;"but what's his group called at this time?"
01:39:06;01:39:10;"- Oh, Rection FX."
01:39:10;01:39:11;"- Rection FX, Rection FX."
01:39:11;01:39:14;"- Rection FX, that's right."
01:39:14;01:39:17;"- I had a friend who was in this video."
01:39:17;01:39:18;"- Really?"
01:39:18;01:39:22;"- Yeah, our friend Alicia was the girl playing the sax,"
01:39:22;01:39:26;"and it got us into every party wherever we went."
01:39:26;01:39:27;"- Wait, that's funny 'cause it says in our notes"
01:39:27;01:39:30;"that the music video is banned from MTV"
01:39:30;01:39:34;"for alleged exploitation of women in bikinis."
01:39:34;01:39:36;"- Oh my God."
01:39:36;01:39:39;"- I guess maybe 'cause there's a party scene."
01:39:39;01:39:40;"- Yeah."
01:39:40;01:39:42;"- It's called Rub Shaker."
01:39:42;01:39:44;"I mean, what did you think was gonna happen?"
01:39:44;01:39:48;"You know what's crazy is that Teddy Riley to me,"
01:39:48;01:39:51;"I mean, Teddy Riley is an icon."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"He's produced probably some of my favorite music"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"that's ever existed."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"This is not my jam."
01:39:57;01:39:58;"I mean, I would dance to it at the club."
01:39:58;01:40:01;"Well, it just feels like in the grand scheme"
01:40:01;01:40:04;"of the kind of production he's done,"
01:40:04;01:40:05;"it's a little boring to me."
01:40:05;01:40:08;"- What's the iconic Teddy Riley stuff?"
01:40:08;01:40:10;"- Well, he was in a group called Guy,"
01:40:10;01:40:12;"which is like my all-time favorite."
01:40:12;01:40:15;"And then he did like even ""No Diggity,"""
01:40:15;01:40:17;"which is Blackstreet."
01:40:17;01:40:20;"It's just like, to me, it's way funkier."
01:40:20;01:40:24;"He did like Michael Jackson, ""Remember the Time."""
01:40:24;01:40:25;"Remember the Time?"
01:40:25;01:40:27;"I'm trying to think of what a big Teddy Riley song."
01:40:27;01:40:29;"- Like the ballad, right."
01:40:29;01:40:29;"- Yeah."
01:40:29;01:40:32;"- So when you were like 16,"
01:40:32;01:40:36;"were you going to like clubs in LA in like '92?"
01:40:37;01:40:39;"- There was a big thing."
01:40:39;01:40:41;"There were like teen clubs in LA"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"and they all kind of kicked off."
01:40:43;01:40:44;"There was this one club,"
01:40:44;01:40:45;"Ezra and I have talked about this,"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"called Alfie's Soda Club,"
01:40:47;01:40:50;"that was like for industry kids."
01:40:50;01:40:52;"They would ask for your resume"
01:40:52;01:40:54;"to like get in the door kind of thing."
01:40:54;01:40:57;"That was in the '80s, like the mid to late '80s."
01:40:57;01:41:00;"And then from that sprung all these other clubs,"
01:41:00;01:41:03;"like David Thread had a club called Ballistic."
01:41:03;01:41:04;"That was like an underage club."
01:41:04;01:41:06;"So like there's no drinks,"
01:41:06;01:41:07;"but it's like everything else is the same"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"and people got wasted."
01:41:09;01:41:13;"And it looked and felt just like clubs,"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"but it was like filled with kids."
01:41:15;01:41:18;"- I just got to say real quick about ""Rump Shaker."""
01:41:18;01:41:21;"It says that, you know, like,"
01:41:21;01:41:25;"'cause Teddy Riley was like a Virginia Beach guy"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"and Pharrell was one of his proteges."
01:41:27;01:41:30;"And this is one of the first songs that Pharrell ever worked on"
01:41:30;01:41:33;"and I guess he didn't actually help with the production,"
01:41:33;01:41:35;"but he came up with,"
01:41:35;01:41:38;"""All I want to do is zoom, zoom, zoom, and a boom, boom."""
01:41:38;01:41:39;"- Whoa."
01:41:39;01:41:41;"- He was probably like, how old is Pharrell?"
01:41:41;01:41:43;"He must've been like-"
01:41:43;01:41:44;"- Young."
01:41:44;01:41:45;"- Like a kid, yeah."
01:41:45;01:41:47;"- Yeah, like a teenager?"
01:41:47;01:41:49;"- I bet Pharrell's like our age, Rashida."
01:41:49;01:41:50;"- He's older."
01:41:50;01:41:51;"- Is he?"
01:41:51;01:41:52;"- Yeah."
01:41:52;01:41:54;"- All right, so maybe he was like 20, but real early."
01:41:54;01:41:55;"- How old is he, like 48, you think?"
01:41:55;01:41:56;"- Around there."
01:41:56;01:41:57;"- Okay. - Yeah."
01:41:57;01:41:59;"Looks 20."
01:41:59;01:42:00;"- Yeah, seriously."
01:42:00;01:42:03;"- All right, let's get back to the ""Modern Rock"" chart."
01:42:03;01:42:04;"Okay, this one's interesting"
01:42:04;01:42:08;"'cause this is an artist I don't really associate with rock."
01:42:08;01:42:10;"I wonder, this is interesting."
01:42:10;01:42:13;"All right, number three on the ""Modern Rock"" chart."
01:42:13;01:42:16;"(soft music)"
01:42:23;01:42:37;"- Four times through."

01:42:44;01:42:46;"- Sounds like Michael Stipe again."
01:42:46;01:42:49;"- It is Stipe, but he's not the artist on this."
01:42:49;01:42:51;"♪ This is all for show ♪"
01:42:51;01:42:52;"- Is it a duet?"
01:42:52;01:42:55;"- I guess so."
01:42:55;01:42:57;"- Is it a band?"
01:42:57;01:43:02;"- No, it's a solo artist who I know from another song."
01:43:02;01:43:03;"- Oh, like the guitarist?"
01:43:03;01:43:05;"- It's the other vocalist."

01:43:22;01:43:26;"- Oh, is that Nana Cherry?"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"- Yes, it's Nana Cherry."
01:43:28;01:43:29;"- Nice."
01:43:29;01:43:30;"- I don't know this song though."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"I know ""Buffalo."""
01:43:31;01:43:32;"- I don't know this song at all."
01:43:32;01:43:34;"- Wait, did you recognize her voice?"
01:43:34;01:43:35;"- Yeah."
01:43:35;01:43:39;"- I loved her single from the late '80s, ""Buffalo Stance."""
01:43:39;01:43:41;"- Yeah, ""Buffalo Stance,"" right."
01:43:41;01:43:43;"- No money, man."
01:43:43;01:43:44;"- So good."
01:43:44;01:43:45;"- So did she go in like kind of an earthy,"
01:43:45;01:43:48;"kind of Ani DiFranco direction?"

01:43:52;01:43:52;"- Yikes."
01:43:52;01:43:57;"- I guess that's like a recreation of John Bonham."
01:43:57;01:44:02;"I mean, this almost could be like an early Beck song."
01:44:02;01:44:03;"You know what I mean?"
01:44:03;01:44:05;"This has like a Beck vibe."
01:44:05;01:44:07;"This song is called ""Trout,"" by the way."
01:44:07;01:44:09;"- ""Trout?"""
01:44:09;01:44:10;"- Yeah."
01:44:10;01:44:14;"- This feels very much categorically like when an artist,"
01:44:14;01:44:16;"people just like an artist,"
01:44:16;01:44:19;"so anything they put out just makes it on a chart."
01:44:19;01:44:20;"You know what I mean?"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"Like Michael Stipe was probably so big."
01:44:22;01:44:23;"- Oh, sure."
01:44:23;01:44:27;"Yeah, maybe it's more Stipe than Nana Cherry."
01:44:27;01:44:28;"She certainly wasn't-"
01:44:28;01:44:31;"- ""Buffalo Stance"" is like '89 or something."
01:44:31;01:44:31;"- Yeah, '88, '89."
01:44:31;01:44:34;"- Yes, it's not that much longer."
01:44:34;01:44:36;"- But also, but Nana Cherry didn't have much of a presence"
01:44:36;01:44:38;"on the rock charts prior to this, right?"
01:44:38;01:44:39;"- Right, that's what I'm saying."
01:44:39;01:44:41;"That's why it's Michael Stipe."
01:44:41;01:44:44;"- I guess also this might've sounded pretty novel."

01:45:00;01:45:07;"- This is tough."
01:45:07;01:45:10;"- Wait, this is straight up like a Beck song."
01:45:10;01:45:12;"Is this a cover?"
01:45:12;01:45:16;"- It does sound like his flow on ""Loser."""
01:45:16;01:45:17;"- Yeah."
01:45:17;01:45:19;"- I heard some late period Beck"
01:45:19;01:45:20;"on the radio the other day on Sirius,"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"and I was like, ""Man, Beck is wack."""

01:45:27;01:45:29;"- J. - Dropping hot J."
01:45:29;01:45:30;"- Not a fan."
01:45:30;01:45:33;"I mean, the early stuff was like kind of novelty."
01:45:33;01:45:36;"Like, let's just like take different production ideas"
01:45:36;01:45:40;"from other music and like have his half-baked songs."
01:45:40;01:45:41;"And then after that, it was just like him"
01:45:41;01:45:44;"like doing sincere singer-songwriter stuff."
01:45:44;01:45:45;"Beck's weak."
01:45:45;01:45:47;"I think he's one of the most overrated artists"
01:45:47;01:45:49;"of the last 20, 30 years."
01:45:49;01:45:51;"- Jake."
01:45:51;01:45:52;"- Jake."
01:45:52;01:45:53;"I like Beck."
01:45:53;01:45:54;"- First of all, ""Loser"" holds up."
01:45:54;01:45:57;"Every time I hear that, it's like-"
01:45:57;01:45:58;"- It's okay."
01:45:58;01:46:01;"- Yeah, but compared, like that was an interesting mix"
01:46:01;01:46:03;"of ideas, but ""Loser"" took that vibe"
01:46:03;01:46:06;"and actually made something that like still knocks today."
01:46:06;01:46:07;"- Yeah."
01:46:07;01:46:09;"- Beck's had a long and varied, fascinating career,"
01:46:09;01:46:12;"but maybe we'll invite Beck on for an episode."
01:46:12;01:46:13;"- Oh my God."
01:46:13;01:46:15;"- Defending your life."
01:46:15;01:46:16;"- I don't think so."
01:46:16;01:46:19;"- Beck versus Jake."
01:46:19;01:46:20;"- I don't want to do that."
01:46:20;01:46:25;"- All right, well, look, Jake, you're your own man."
01:46:25;01:46:29;"You're dropping a spicy Gen X take on a Gen X icon, so."
01:46:29;01:46:31;"- Yeah, he truly is."
01:46:31;01:46:35;"- That song was ""Nana Cherry Trout"""
01:46:35;01:46:37;"featuring Michael Stipe."
01:46:37;01:46:38;"I'm not familiar with the song."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"- Great title."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"- I guess none of us are."
01:46:40;01:46:41;"That's pretty wild."
01:46:41;01:46:42;"- That's crazy."
01:46:42;01:46:43;"- Trout."
01:46:43;01:46:46;"- Trout would be a great name for a band."
01:46:46;01:46:47;"- Yeah."
01:46:47;01:46:50;"- It'd be a great name for a jam band open for Goose."
01:46:50;01:46:52;"- Oh man, you going down to the Trout Goose show?"
01:46:52;01:46:55;"- What's up, we're Trout from Waterbury."
01:46:55;01:46:58;"- Sounds like a bad Game of Thrones dinner."
01:46:58;01:47:01;"- Trout and Goose."
01:47:01;01:47:03;"- Just Trout followed up by some Goose."
01:47:03;01:47:05;"- Trout followed up by Goose."
01:47:07;01:47:11;"- Okay, so now we're at number two on the R&B charts."
01:47:11;01:47:12;"- Okay, here we go, ""Heat N' Noth."""
01:47:12;01:47:13;"- Let's get in."
01:47:13;01:47:18;"- I got it, ""Shy."""
01:47:18;01:47:20;"Well, he said it."
01:47:20;01:47:28;"- It's got real Keith Sweat energy."
01:47:28;01:47:35;"- Oh, this is the remix of ""If I Ever Fall In Love."""
01:47:35;01:47:36;"- That's right."
01:47:36;01:47:38;"- Wait, so what band is this?"
01:47:38;01:47:39;"- ""Shy."""
01:47:39;01:47:41;"- Oh, ""Shy."""
01:47:41;01:47:42;"- You would know the other version."
01:47:42;01:47:57;"- This is trippy."
01:47:57;01:48:01;"- Oh yeah, we listened to this on TC."
01:48:01;01:48:02;"This is a cool song."
01:48:02;01:48:07;"♪ I, I knew right then you were the one ♪"
01:48:07;01:48:13;"♪ But I was caught up in physical attraction ♪"

01:48:17;01:48:18;"- Did they go to Howard?"
01:48:18;01:48:19;"- Damn."
01:48:19;01:48:20;"- Howard?"
01:48:20;01:48:23;"- Yes, they met on the campus of Howard and formed a group."
01:48:23;01:48:24;"- This made like every guy I know"
01:48:24;01:48:28;"wanna be in like a acapella group, which."
01:48:28;01:48:28;"- Because of this song?"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"- No, it doesn't happen that many times."
01:48:30;01:48:31;"Yeah, in a lifetime."
01:48:32;01:48:33;"- This is really trippy."
01:48:33;01:48:35;"Is this, you think this is done live?"
01:48:35;01:48:37;"- Yeah, probably some of it."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"You could, maybe like the lead vocal,"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"you can do a couple of takes, but."
01:48:41;01:48:43;"Jake, I wonder if Dave knows this song."
01:48:43;01:48:45;"Kind of reminds me of ""Gun Has No Trigger."""
01:48:45;01:48:47;"- I was thinking this, it reminded me of like"
01:48:47;01:48:50;"a weird Dirty Projectors vocal arrangement."
01:48:50;01:48:52;"The timing is really weird."
01:48:52;01:48:54;"It almost feels like they like have the lead vocal"
01:48:54;01:48:57;"and the backing vocals, and they just put it off"
01:48:57;01:49:00;"by like a half a measure or something."

01:49:14;01:49:17;"- Garfield? - Oh my God, Garfield!"
01:49:17;01:49:18;"- His first name was Garfield?"
01:49:18;01:49:19;"- Yeah."
01:49:19;01:49:20;"- Get out of here, his first name was Garfield?"
01:49:20;01:49:22;"- That's right, yeah, look it up."
01:49:22;01:49:23;"- What was his last name?"
01:49:23;01:49:25;"- Garfield Bright."
01:49:25;01:49:26;"- Whoa, that's eerie."
01:49:26;01:49:27;"- That's weird, you guys."
01:49:27;01:49:29;"Synergy, Vader Meinhof."
01:49:29;01:49:33;"Garfield the movie, Garfield the dude from ""Shy."""
01:49:33;01:49:36;"Did they have an illustrious career, Rashida?"
01:49:36;01:49:37;"- I don't know."
01:49:37;01:49:40;"I feel like they seem like boys who like,"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"I could just imagine them going and having like"
01:49:42;01:49:45;"good careers doing something else, you know?"
01:49:45;01:49:47;"Like they would, 'cause it's so weird."
01:49:47;01:49:50;"There's so many groups like this."
01:49:50;01:49:52;"We talked about this, like from the '90s,"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"there's just like so many people in the groups,"
01:49:54;01:49:56;"and you're like, what happened to everybody?"
01:49:56;01:50:01;"Like all of those people had to go do something else"
01:50:01;01:50:04;"because the whole genre kind of like broke apart"
01:50:04;01:50:05;"and there's just no more groups anymore."
01:50:05;01:50:08;"So like they had to be doing something, you know?"
01:50:08;01:50:09;"- Well, yeah, it looks like that was--"
01:50:09;01:50:12;"- He's a doctor, you guys."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"- Wait, Garfield embraced the doctor?"
01:50:14;01:50:15;"- Yes."
01:50:15;01:50:16;"- Doctor of what?"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"- He's a veterinarian."
01:50:18;01:50:20;"- That's awesome."
01:50:20;01:50:21;"- Is he a veterinarian?"
01:50:21;01:50:23;"- Oh God, that would be insane."
01:50:23;01:50:25;"I thought you were saying you found that."
01:50:25;01:50:28;"- No, he's specifically, he specializes in orange cats."
01:50:28;01:50:33;"He specializes in orange cats and he's based in Toronto."
01:50:33;01:50:36;"- I mean, you know, there's some conservatives"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"that are not gonna like this, but he has a PhD."
01:50:38;01:50:42;"He's not a medical doctor for animals nor people."
01:50:42;01:50:44;"- Oh, it's a Jill Biden situation."
01:50:44;01:50:47;"But what's his doctorate then?"
01:50:47;01:50:51;"- He studied African-centered education."
01:50:51;01:50:55;"He won an outstanding dissertation at Georgia State."
01:50:55;01:50:56;"I don't know."
01:50:56;01:50:59;"- All right, well, shout out to Dr. Garfield A. Bright."
01:50:59;01:51:00;"That's sick."
01:51:00;01:51:03;"- See, I told you, he was like a good boy."
01:51:03;01:51:04;"Like I knew it was like gonna go."
01:51:04;01:51:08;"I felt like he was, yeah, African-American studies."
01:51:08;01:51:10;"- Yeah, you could imagine like,"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"if you started an a cappella group,"
01:51:12;01:51:14;"you go to like good school,"
01:51:14;01:51:16;"you and your friends start an a cappella group,"
01:51:16;01:51:19;"a producer finds you, you have one big hit."
01:51:19;01:51:23;"You could imagine after a few years of that being like,"
01:51:23;01:51:26;"man, that's like, I'm gonna go get my PhD now."
01:51:26;01:51:28;"- Yeah, like that was fun."
01:51:28;01:51:29;"- We're not Boyz II Men over here."
01:51:29;01:51:33;"- So that song, ""If I Ever Fall in Love"""
01:51:33;01:51:36;"peaked at number two on like the Billboard charts,"
01:51:36;01:51:38;"but it was there for eight weeks,"
01:51:38;01:51:41;"which is the second longest run at number two"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"for a song in Billboard Hot 100 history."
01:51:43;01:51:46;"""Foreigner,"" ""Waiting for a Girl Like You"" spent 10 weeks."
01:51:46;01:51:49;"- Wow, that's pretty cool."
01:51:49;01:51:51;"What a random foreign song."
01:51:51;01:51:53;"- I could also imagine if you're Garfield A. Bright"
01:51:53;01:51:56;"and you're like, should I go get my PhD?"
01:51:56;01:51:59;"And you're like, God, if I should give up my studies"
01:51:59;01:52:01;"and do this for the rest of my life,"
01:52:01;01:52:03;"make it go to number one,"
01:52:03;01:52:05;"and then just stay at the number two for eight weeks."
01:52:05;01:52:07;"And he's like, all right, PhD time."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"Worked out."
01:52:09;01:52:10;"- Damn."
01:52:10;01:52:13;"- Jake, are you ready for the number two song?"
01:52:13;01:52:14;"- I am."
01:52:14;01:52:15;"- I do feel a little bit bad for Jake here"
01:52:15;01:52:17;"just 'cause there's something about,"
01:52:17;01:52:20;"'92 was still a very transitional year actually"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"for alternative rock."
01:52:22;01:52:25;"And I would say that, me taking a sneak peek,"
01:52:25;01:52:27;"it's a little random."
01:52:27;01:52:28;"- Okay."
01:52:28;01:52:33;"- I feel like '94 was probably the '92 of the rock charts"
01:52:33;01:52:36;"when just like it was really cooking with gas."
01:52:36;01:52:38;"Anyway, this is the number two song"
01:52:38;01:52:41;"on the modern rock charts this week in '92."
01:52:50;01:52:53;"- What a (laughs)"
01:52:56;01:53:00;"- Oh."
01:53:00;01:53:01;"- This is sick."

01:53:16;01:53:18;"- Yes."
01:53:18;01:53:18;"- Nice, Jake."
01:53:18;01:53:19;"- No way."
01:53:19;01:53:21;"- Ned's Atomic Dustbin."
01:53:21;01:53:22;"- How did I pull that out of my head?"
01:53:22;01:53:24;"- Do you know what the song's called?"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"- No, I don't know that."
01:53:26;01:53:27;"- Oh, that's--"
01:53:27;01:53:30;"- It sounds like, like, Rit Pop, man."
01:53:30;01:53:33;"It sounds like Stone Roses or like Ride or something."
01:53:33;01:53:34;"- No."
01:53:34;01:53:35;"- Right."
01:53:35;01:53:36;"- This is number two?"
01:53:36;01:53:37;"- Yeah."
01:53:37;01:53:39;"- What's going on in the modern rock category?"
01:53:39;01:53:40;"- Yeah, this is like--"
01:53:40;01:53:41;"- What is--"
01:53:42;01:53:44;"- Post-rave English music."
01:53:44;01:53:47;"It's pretty like a Octongue Baby too."
01:53:47;01:53:48;"- Right, yeah."
01:53:48;01:53:50;"- This song eventually made it to number one"
01:53:50;01:53:52;"on the modern rock chart."
01:53:52;01:53:53;"Yeah, it's just like '92."
01:53:53;01:53:55;"It's also a reminder that it's like,"
01:53:55;01:53:59;"so this was roughly like a year after Nevermind,"
01:53:59;01:54:00;"but it's still kind of transitional"
01:54:00;01:54:05;"where you see like the, yeah, R.E.M., Naina Cherry, this."
01:54:05;01:54:09;"It's like, it's before just like '90s alternative rock"
01:54:09;01:54:10;"really got like kind of--"
01:54:10;01:54:11;"- Hegemonic."
01:54:11;01:54:13;"- Hegemonic, yeah, exactly."
01:54:13;01:54:16;"- Yeah, I mean, if the next song was Guns N' Roses,"
01:54:16;01:54:18;"I wouldn't be surprised."
01:54:18;01:54:19;"- Right."
01:54:19;01:54:20;"- Oh, we should maybe guess."
01:54:20;01:54:22;"- So this is one where it really deviates."
01:54:22;01:54:23;"I'm looking at the number ones for both of you."
01:54:23;01:54:28;"So, Rashida, the number one on the R&B charts this week is--"
01:54:28;01:54:31;"- Is it also on the pop chart?"
01:54:31;01:54:31;"- It would have been."
01:54:31;01:54:33;"It's a really big song."
01:54:33;01:54:37;"And then Jake, the number one on yours is ""Random."""
01:54:37;01:54:39;"- Maybe it's my favorite guitarist, Eric Clapton."
01:54:39;01:54:42;"- You're not cold cold."
01:54:42;01:54:43;"- Okay."
01:54:43;01:54:46;"Also, for the record, not my favorite guitarist."
01:54:46;01:54:47;"But anyways--"
01:54:47;01:54:48;"- I got that, I got your chart."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"(laughing)"
01:54:49;01:54:52;"- Let's get to a number one R&B chart."
01:54:52;01:54:53;"- Do you wanna guess, Rashida,"
01:54:53;01:54:58;"what the number one song on the R&B/hip-hop charts was?"
01:54:58;01:55:02;"- My guess was Janet Jackson."
01:55:02;01:55:03;"- No, it's not Janet Jackson."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"- Is it an artist that's big on the pop charts"
01:55:05;01:55:07;"or is it an artist that crossed over"
01:55:07;01:55:09;"with this particular song?"
01:55:09;01:55:13;"- This artist would have already been big on the pop charts."
01:55:13;01:55:15;"But this song is huge. - Toni Braxton?"
01:55:15;01:55:16;"Or Mariah?"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"Is it a chanteuse?"
01:55:18;01:55:18;"Is it like a--"
01:55:18;01:55:20;"- It's a female singer."
01:55:20;01:55:24;"This is one of the biggest singles of all time."
01:55:24;01:55:25;"- Jesus."
01:55:25;01:55:27;"- So is it Whitney?"
01:55:27;01:55:28;"- Yes."
01:55:28;01:55:29;"- It's Whitney, okay."
01:55:29;01:55:32;"So is it, so it's a bodyguard."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"- Yeah."
