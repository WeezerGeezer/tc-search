00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:12;"We reunite to talk about many things, including the group who performed the song you're listening to right now."
00:12;00:17;"We're also joined by Rashida Jones for another Gen X Top 5 Challenge."
00:17;00:24;"Plus, we discuss soul movies and the Biden administration's push for world peace."
00:24;00:30;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:30;00:35;"Time Crisis"
01:15;01:19;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:19;01:21;"It's been a long time."
01:21;01:23;"Been a while."
01:23;01:25;"It's been a while."
01:25;01:32;"It's almost been long enough that if we made this entire episode about ""Stained,"" we could probably bring a fresh perspective to it."
01:32;01:37;"That would be like, that would be a true time crisis."
01:37;01:46;"We start alternating between live episodes and banked, and because the month gap is too long to remember what we did last time,"
01:46;01:52;"it always opens with Jake going, ""It's been a while,"" and then I'm like, ""Hey, you know Aaron Lewis has been dropping some new singles, actually."""
01:52;01:58;"And we just recreate a slightly different version of the Aaron Lewis ""Stained"" episode over and over again."
01:58;02:00;"True black mirror right there."
02:00;02:10;"I am sad to report that, like we said when we did that whole episode about Aaron Lewis, for people who don't remember, he does kind of MAGA country stuff now."
02:10;02:21;"He is a master melodicist, because not only has it been a while, obviously people sing that always, but I still randomly just like sitting there and just go,"
02:21;02:24;"""Am I the only one?"""
02:24;02:29;"And someone's like, ""What song are you singing?"" And I'm just like, ""Don't worry about it."""
02:29;02:33;"""Am I the only one willing to fight?"""
02:33;02:35;"It's truly an earworm."
02:35;02:39;"Are you going full Herm Jarl on that? Just like walking around the house?"
02:39;02:43;"""Am I the only one? Am I the only one?"""
02:43;02:49;"That could have been an interesting song in like the early 90s. It wouldn't have had the political angle, but that could be like a Temple of the Dog song."
02:49;03:04;"Oh, absolutely. I saw the official Time Crisis Twitter account had some great Herm Jarl content in relation to this new Matt Damon, Ben Affleck film called ""The Last
Duel."""
03:04;03:14;"And the vibe is incredibly Herm Jarl. And then I saw a friend of the show, Stephen Hyden, jump in with his own version of, ""Is this a Layne Staley biopic?"""
03:14;03:26;"Because the picture of Ben Affleck with the weird, he has this weird kind of like, the way he's holding his face in his mouth, it looks like he's just going,
""Waaaaaaahhhhhh."""
03:26;03:39;"Wait, hold on. We need some context. Seinfeld, can you explain? So this is Herm Jarl the film because by the way, Herm Jarl as a kind of folk hero concept that is Time
Crisis intellectual property."
03:39;03:47;"So if either Matt or Ben are playing Herm Jarl, the spirit of grunge, you'll be hearing from our lawyers. Is that what's going on here?"
03:47;04:07;"This is a Ridley Scott's new film. It was actually also written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. And I mean, yeah, Jake said it best. Ben Affleck is in the movie poster,
close up on his face, bleached goatee and sort of like a little bit of like, how would you describe that haircut? It's part cryer tuck."
04:07;04:13;"Cropped? It's cropped. But also blonde. Is this film a period piece?"
04:13;04:33;"Yeah, it's set in 14th century France. Oh. That's just the way it's like a medieval Herm Jarl. It's Herm Jarl early 90s Seattle. Yeah, it's Herm Jarl. But it's got that
energy about it for whatever reason. And yeah, Adam Driver's in it. Don't know too much else about it."
04:33;04:41;"Adam's got some real Herm energy too. Oh, totally. But and so these guys, they're in a band in 14th century France?"
04:41;04:47;"It's all about knights. I don't think there's any bards or music, lute playing or anything like that."
04:47;04:49;"Well, actually, knights were the original bands."
04:49;04:51;"That's true. Well, there you go."
04:51;05:08;"Obviously, there's the origins of like kind of big bands and groups of musicians, but the real concept of a band that kind of started in the post-war era, because after
World War II, that was kind of one of the last true global conflicts where young men from all across the globe packed up to go fight."
05:08;05:29;"So in the absence of that kind of band of brothers thing, which of course ties all the way back to knighthood and King Arthur and things of that nature, there are all these
kind of aimless young dudes and they kind of decided to start bands rather than going off to fight. And that's true. I believe people have made that point before."
05:29;05:35;"So I don't think it's actually that crazy to tie back 14th century French knights to bands. Not at all."
05:35;05:48;"I mean, and honestly, bands, they took the good aspects of that and they left some of the violence and the conquering. But the Crusades, that was a pretty f***ed up, but
that was a tour. A lot of these things are tours."
05:48;06:10;"Actually, in the military, they use the term tour. Am I correct, Seinfeld? Tour of duty? I mean, yeah. A band of brothers on tour. That could be happening in 1991 in the
Pacific Northwest. That could be happening in 14th century France. But a band of brothers on tour, this is an eternal concept."
06:10;06:19;"Vampire weekend hitting the road next year. Not that different from storming the beaches of Normandy. Just a question of degrees. That's all."
06:19;06:21;"Exactly."
06:21;06:33;"There's a good movie. This is a movie. There's a band like Vampire Weekend, but their tour manager sort of f***s things up and sends them to the Middle East to fight."
06:33;06:40;"Basically like Tropic Thunder. It'd kind of be like Tropic Thunder for about 1/16 of the audience."
06:40;06:46;"I thought you were going to go full Bill and Ted. I thought you were going to say their manager sent them back in time to the Middle Ages."
06:46;06:50;"To fight in a war in the Middle Ages."
06:50;06:54;"They have to go bring Herm Jarl back from 14th century France."
06:54;07:00;"What I was going to say about the Herm Jarl is, do you remember in A Knight's Tale how they used sort of David Bowie?"
07:00;07:01;"Classic rock, right?"
07:01;07:09;"Classic rock. I do think for The Last Duel it would be great if the whole soundtrack were just Herm Jarl. I mean, I think that that's the kind of thing. It's a vibe."
07:09;07:21;"So wait, wait. Is this about Vampire Weekend inventing grunge? Like it's almost like a yesterday thing where in the 14th century they introduced grunge music?"
07:21;07:28;"Yeah, through just sort of like some kind of tour manager's sort of small mishap, they're sent back in time."
07:28;07:34;"And the genre of choice that they choose to introduce is grunge. Is that Herm Jarl sound?"
07:34;07:42;"Immediately my mind goes to the hit film from 2001, Black Knight. The Martin Lawrence vehicle. You guys ever see that?"
07:42;07:51;"Because I believe that's also a time travel thing. Hold on. I'm reading the 2001 Martin Lawrence film. This is the plot."
07:51;07:59;"Jamal Walker is an everyday slacker with a job at a theme park called Medieval World, which is about to receive big competition from another theme park, Castle World."
07:59;08:05;"While cleaning a moat surrounding the park, he finds a medallion and when he tries to retrieve it, gets sucked into the past."
08:05;08:16;"He awakes in 1328 England and he... actually this rolls. So the character Jamal Walker is from South Central Los Angeles."
08:16;08:22;"And as all these LA residents here know, there's a famous intersection Florence and Normandy."
08:22;08:27;"So he tells them he's from Florence and Normandy and they assume that he's from Normandy in France."
08:27;08:37;"And anyway, there's a scene that I vividly remember from this where he basically tries to recreate 20th century music using the musicians in the court of the king."
08:37;08:44;"So he kind of has like the drummer kick off a beat and then he has like the dudes with those like long trumpets kind of like do like kind of like a funk song."
08:44;08:51;"So anyway, we could use that as a model except that's a good movie. I encourage everybody to go revisit Black Knight."
08:51;09:00;"I could see a version where a young Jimmy Page and Robert Plant are transported back to the medieval times and they just start playing their music and it's just like a
complete fit."
09:00;09:02;"Battle of Evermore?"
09:02;09:04;"Right, yeah. People would love it."
09:04;09:05;"No issue."
09:05;09:18;"The Queen of Light took her vow and then she turned to gold. The Prince of Peace embraced the gold and walked the night alone."
09:18;09:24;"Who does in the dark of night sing to them all?"
09:24;09:30;"The dark lord rides in force tonight and time will tell us all."
09:30;09:37;"Oh, spread out your cloud and hold, rest not to lock your heart."
09:37;09:42;"Side by side we wait the might of the darkest dawn."
09:42;09:52;"Oh, it's the dark lord."
09:52;09:56;"So anyway, wouldn't we say today was going to be another stand episode?"
09:56;09:57;"Yeah."
09:57;10:00;"Lots happened in the ALU."
10:00;10:05;"What's the ALU? Oh, the Aaron Lewis Universe."
10:05;10:23;"Okay, well I think I'm looking at our docket. I would say that we should start because I actually haven't heard these but Jake, you hit the thread letting us know a couple
weeks ago that a very important band of brothers and sisters that is very important to this show and yet we just don't talk about them enough."
10:23;10:33;"They're so important to the show that actually there are special guests every single episode and yet we never do a deep dive on them. You know what I'm talking about?
ABBA."
10:33;10:34;"Hell yeah."
10:34;10:46;"The creators of the Time Crisis theme song, which I should point out they didn't create specifically for Time Crisis but I think we're probably the only internet radio
show who uses that song as our theme."
10:46;10:57;"So ABBA, the legendary Swedish band, arguably the kind of inventors of so many aspects of the modern pop world and this is true."
10:57;11:18;"ABBA was like the first Swedish superstar pop act and as I understand it, if you go back to the main songwriters in ABBA, Bjorn and Benny, there's a direct line from those
guys to the Max Martens to the post-Max Martin, all the big Swedish pop people actually all have something."
11:18;11:35;"You can trace them all back to these guys. I don't know if they set up a studio or some sort of songwriting academy but these guys really invented something that went on to
rock the world, which is not just ABBA but the whole concept of the Swedish pop genius. It really starts with ABBA."
11:35;11:37;"Was Rock set from Sweden?"
11:37;11:38;"I think they're German."
11:38;11:39;"Oh, okay."
11:39;11:41;"Can we get a number crunch on that?"
11:41;11:42;"They are Swedish."
11:42;11:44;"Oh, they're Swedish."
11:44;11:54;"I feel like they're like the middle, the sort of the missing link between the 70s glory of ABBA and then the... because did Max Martin write those early Britney songs?"
11:54;11:56;"Yeah, that's when he really popped on the scene."
11:56;12:03;"Oops, I Did It Again? Like the chords in Oops, I Did It Again have a real ABBA feel to them."
12:03;12:09;"Oh, absolutely. And then don't forget in the early 90s, you have Ace of Base, again, kind of out of nowhere."
12:09;12:11;"That's what I was thinking of too."
12:11;12:23;"That classic Swedish reggae. I think like a lot of the Scandinavian countries, when you start getting back into the not so distant past, these countries were not...
they're kind of off on their own trip."
12:23;12:29;"Norway hadn't found those big oil reserves. They weren't these kind of like pillars of like the modern..."
12:29;12:34;"Modern democratic/capitalist sort of utopias."
12:34;12:37;"Yeah, they were, you know, they're off on their own Scandi trip."
12:37;12:44;"You know, it's funny when you think of or what like when I think of Scandinavian music, I think of the pop mastery of Max Martin and ABBA."
12:44;12:57;"And then I think of like all the mythology surrounding black metal, which I think maybe is a little more Norwegian, but I think there must be like Swedish where there's
like guys killing each other and like burning down churches and just like..."
12:57;13:01;"Yeah, a lot of those famous bands are Norwegian, but it's the same peninsula."
13:01;13:05;"It's the same peninsula."
13:05;13:13;"Yeah, and obviously there's the Swedish contributions to indie music and there's always this cool music coming from Sweden."
13:13;13:17;"And there was, of course, there was cool Swedish music before ABBA too."
13:17;13:25;"I've heard like random sh*t that like DJ Shadow sampled just like cool, weird Swedish folk music from the 60s."
13:25;13:37;"But ABBA again, they really created something that I don't think anybody could have predicted that one of the biggest bands in the world creating hit after hit would
come from a non-English speaking country."
13:37;13:44;"Although famously a country where people are very speak English flawlessly because it's prioritized in their education."
13:44;13:52;"But anyway, ABBA, I guess I haven't heard them, but Jake, you hit the thread saying ABBA just dropped two new singles."
13:52;13:56;"Yeah, I haven't listened to them either. So this is a great opportunity."
13:56;13:58;"I feel like we owe it to ABBA to cover this."
13:58;14:12;"They've provided us so much joy, episode after episode, with their hit song One of Us, that we're not going to turn our back on their later material just because they've
been quiet since 1981."
14:12;14:19;"That's amazing. For a band that was huge in the late 70s, they like really like pulled the plug like seemingly abruptly."
14:19;14:25;"I mean, I would have thought there'd be like, you know, it's kind of tapering levels of success through the mid 80s or so."
14:25;14:30;"You know, couldn't you picture like there being an ABBA album from like '87 that didn't do well?"
14:30;14:31;"Oh yeah, totally."
14:31;14:33;"Sounds like they just like '81 were out."
14:33;14:39;"Yeah, just like an awkward 1990 album where they're trying to kind of experiment with like house."
14:39;14:40;"Yeah."
14:40;14:54;"Just not really knowing their place. Yeah, like a really awkward like Eagles Hell Freezes Over, like 1994 album where everybody's wearing just kind of like awkward
plaid shirts and just like uncomfortable looking jeans."
14:54;15:01;"ABBA has so much in common with Fleetwood Mac in that there were at minimum two couples in the band which broke up."
15:01;15:02;"Oh, I didn't know that."
15:02;15:10;"ABBA was initially two couples and they both broke up and at first they used that sadness and they channeled into the music."
15:10;15:19;"One of their best singles in my opinion is The Winter Takes It All, which is about the harshness of breakups and moving on and trying to be cool."
15:19;15:22;"And that came out after some of these breakups happened."
15:22;15:44;"But one thing about ABBA though is that they've been good about keeping the flame alive because any of these like superstar artists, these bands, like even if the band
only existed briefly, like the Beatles, you know, famously they were together what, seven, eight years, ABBA, there's still a lot of energy goes into running that
business."
15:44;15:57;"Because that's a big business 10, 20 years later and ABBA brilliantly kept the flame alive and kind of pioneered even in the afterlife of the band, the Jukebox musical
with Mamma Mia."
15:57;16:01;"So already that was like a huge hit and then they make a movie and then there's a sequel to the movie."
16:01;16:12;"So I'm sure like they were having meetings long after ABBA ceased to function as like a touring entity where they're just like, all right, what's the five year plan?"
16:12;16:15;"How are we going to keep people digging into the catalog?"
16:15;16:20;"And they're just like, all right, well, we got this and then we got the movie and then we can reissue a Greatest Hits."
16:20;16:22;"And I think they have a museum in Stockholm."
16:22;16:24;"So they've been working the IP."
16:24;16:26;"Don't think that they've been quiet for 40 years."
16:26;16:37;"I love it. There's like six or seven years of like burning creativity and then there's 40 years of just like meetings with lawyers, marketing executives."
16:37;16:41;"You just summed up so much stuff that way."
16:41;16:46;"Six or seven years of burning creativity, 40 years of lawyers and meetings."
16:46;16:56;"I don't want to talk about things we've gone through."
16:56;16:59;"Though it's hurting me."
16:59;17:04;"Now it's history."
17:04;17:08;"I've played all my cards."
17:08;17:12;"And that's what you've done to."
17:12;17:16;"Nothing more to say."
17:16;17:19;"No more race to play."
17:19;17:23;"The winner takes it all."
17:23;17:27;"The loser is standing small."
17:27;17:31;"Beside the victory."
17:31;17:35;"That's my destiny."
17:35;17:39;"I was in your arms."
17:39;17:43;"Thinking I belong there."
17:43;17:47;"I figured it made sense."
17:47;17:51;"Building me a fence."
17:51;17:54;"Building me a home."
17:54;17:58;"Thinking I'd be strong there."
17:58;18:02;"But I was a fool."
18:02;18:06;"Laying by the rules."
18:06;18:10;"The gods make roll the dice."
18:10;18:14;"Their minds as cold as ice."
18:14;18:18;"And someone way down here."
18:18;18:21;"Loses someone dear."
18:21;18:25;"The winner takes it all."
18:25;18:29;"The loser has to fall."
18:29;18:32;"It's simple and it's plain."
18:32;18:36;"Why should I complain?"
18:36;18:44;"It reminds me, I just, I mean, I would say the Stones had like 16, 17 years of burning creativity."
18:44;18:46;"But I saw the poster."
18:46;18:48;"Well, hold on Jake, you're a big fan of Steel Wheels."
18:48;18:50;"So you gotta give them at least 25 years."
18:50;18:55;"I would say they have 25 years of creativity and maybe 15 of burning creativity."
18:55;18:57;"Which is a ton for a rock band."
18:57;19:03;"But I just saw, speaking of that sort of like 40 years of marketing meetings on Twitter."
19:03;19:09;"The Stones first gig post Charlie Watts was playing a private gig for Robert Kraft."
19:09;19:12;"Owner of the New England Patriots."
19:12;19:15;"I'm just like, what, why?"
19:15;19:16;"You're like 80."
19:16;19:20;"Maybe you're friends with Bob Kraft and you're like, you know what, that'd be fun."
19:20;19:23;"Yeah, I think there must be a friendship element."
19:23;19:25;"Yeah, I mean, Bob Kraft birthday."
19:25;19:29;"You're going to be getting all sorts of big wigs there."
19:29;19:31;"I could see Mick being like, oh, it's going to be a cool scene."
19:31;19:34;"There's going to be a lot of CEOs and I don't know."
19:34;19:37;"Probably like a cool scene."
19:37;19:38;"A lot of CEOs."
19:38;19:41;"Wait, yeah, do we have a guest list anywhere?"
19:41;19:46;"If I had to guess a few people would be at the Robert Kraft's birthday party with the Stones playing."
19:46;19:52;"Yeah, probably some CEOs was like Dana White from UFC."
19:52;19:57;"Dana White could have been there, but I'm picturing like, I don't know, was like Evan Spiegel there."
19:57;19:58;"Who's that?"
19:58;20:01;"He invented Snapchat or something."
20:01;20:02;"Snapchat founder."
20:02;20:05;"And I think you're going to get some like an interesting mix of celebs."
20:05;20:07;"I bet like John McEnroe was probably there."
20:07;20:12;"John McEnroe and Mick Jagger just having like a chat for like the 30th time in their life."
20:12;20:14;"Just being at the same party."
20:14;20:19;"McEnroe's like, I've never actually been to one of your concerts, but I have seen you play like nine private gigs."
20:19;20:20;"Yeah, exactly."
20:20;20:22;"Over the last 20 years."
20:22;20:23;"I could totally picture that."
20:23;20:29;"Just John McEnroe and Mick Jagger, Robert Kraft's birthday party and Mick sees him and he's like, John, how's it going?"
20:29;20:36;"And then they just have some just real mundane, like he's probably like, did you watch the US Open?"
20:36;20:37;"And he's like, yeah, of course."
20:37;20:39;"I watch all the Grand Slams."
20:39;20:41;"And he's like, you want to know who is there?"
20:41;20:42;"Yeah."
20:42;20:45;"So this is from a new source."
20:45;20:52;"So 300 spectators included Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, New Bar FIN."
20:52;20:58;"I know who that is, but I do like, oh, the co-founder and chair of Vaccine Maker Moderna."
20:58;21:00;"The Jay Giles Band singer Peter Wolfe."
21:00;21:03;"Oh, hell yeah."
21:03;21:11;"The audience also included finance executives, fellow sports franchise owners and Patriots linebacker Andre Tippett."
21:11;21:14;"No Tom Brady invite."
21:14;21:15;"Oh, damn."
21:15;21:16;"I guess they're not friends."
21:16;21:17;"They're not boys anymore."
21:17;21:19;"Former business partners."
21:19;21:23;"But you're not finding any Intel that John McEnroe is there."
21:23;21:24;"No."
21:24;21:25;"Dana White was there."
21:25;21:26;"Oh, I called it."
21:26;21:28;"Dana White was there?"
21:28;21:30;"Dana White was there."
21:30;21:31;"Well, I picked it up."
21:31;21:33;"Mick, I don't know if we know."
21:33;21:35;"I've met you about five times."
21:35;21:36;"Don't expect you to remember me."
21:36;21:39;"But what is it going to take to get you at a UFC event, man?"
21:39;21:40;"I know you're a sports guy."
21:40;21:44;"I know you love soccer, cricket, all that English."
21:44;21:47;"But come on, what's it going to take to get you come out to a UFC event?"
21:47;21:48;"I'll take care of you, man."
21:48;21:49;"It's going to be real fun."
21:49;21:51;"Well, you know, I could."
21:51;21:54;"I mean, this is absolutely unbelievable."
21:54;21:55;"I mean, just this."
21:55;21:58;"This is crazy."
21:58;22:02;"The CEO of PepsiCo."
22:02;22:03;"Very cool."
22:03;22:12;"I mean, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute CEO, the Providence Capitals CEO, the owner, co-owner of the Celtics."
22:12;22:13;"But really, it's this."
22:13;22:17;"When you start looking at Bain Capital CEO."
22:17;22:18;"All the Bain guys were there."
22:18;22:20;"I mean, basically, we nailed it."
22:20;22:27;"I came up with Dana White and Ezra was like, a lot of CEOs."
22:27;22:29;"Notorious party animals."
22:29;22:34;"Oh, man. No, I just realized what a big type of conversation that was going down probably was."
22:34;22:41;"Was these like older, mostly dudes were probably like standing there with some of their buddies or their partners."
22:41;22:46;"And they're just like, oh, man, I'd love to say hi to Mick, but I don't want to bother him."
22:46;22:51;"And like somebody's like buddies like, bro, you're not just some random dude."
22:51;22:54;"You f***ing own the Indianapolis Colts."
22:54;22:56;"Mick has played at your venue."
22:56;22:57;"Go talk to him."
22:57;23:04;"I bet like five different dudes rolled up and just like, Mick, I don't know you, but we did have you in Indianapolis a couple of years back."
23:04;23:06;"You absolutely crushed it."
23:06;23:07;"Were the facilities all right?"
23:07;23:10;"And Mick's just like, Mick is probably so diplomatic."
23:10;23:12;"He's like, oh, yeah, man, it was amazing."
23:12;23:17;"Just like random NFL owners just coming to chop it up with him about their stadiums."
23:17;23:18;"Like that's their way in."
23:18;23:20;"I bet that conversation happened five to seven times."
23:20;23:22;"Can I pitch to you what I think it was like?"
23:22;23:31;"I think that it was a bunch of these guys who are basically talking business and were kind of like, I wish Mick would shut the f*** up."
23:31;23:34;"I bet they were during the set."
23:34;23:37;"Yeah, I just Ezra's been to one of these with me."
23:37;23:43;"But like every year, you know, there are these upfronts that the salespeople do for these television shows."
23:43;23:46;"And you have these giant bands like we had at Adultum."
23:46;23:50;"We had Jay-Z, you know, come in and they do it for about 500 or less people."
23:50;23:54;"We had Kanye and it's for all these salespeople."
23:54;23:56;"And they're performing this small venue."
23:56;24:02;"And for the most part, none of those people paid any attention to what was going on on stage."
24:02;24:04;"They were really there like talking business."
24:04;24:11;"And like, they're so cynical and they're so well, like they just had no interest in the actual thing we were doing."
24:11;24:18;"So you'd have like Kanye performing and in the back, people would just be like trying to talk over Kanye like while getting drinks."
24:18;24:19;"You know what I mean?"
24:19;24:21;"It was a very brutal vibe."
24:21;24:23;"So it's like they want to say they're there."
24:23;24:25;"Look, I mean, we've played some privates before."
24:25;24:28;"And I will say many artists do them."
24:28;24:30;"They're not always brutal."
24:30;24:35;"I mean, in some ways, they're kind of like humbling because yeah, it's not like just like your fans."
24:35;24:38;"It is people at a party and you kind of have to try to win them over."
24:38;24:41;"You just have to like, you know, chill out and go with it."
24:41;24:43;"Many, many artists do them."
24:43;24:57;"The only thing I'd say is that it's just hard to picture being in my late 70s and one of the dudes I've been playing music with for 50 years just died and just being like, all
right, boys."
24:57;24:59;"It should almost go on."
24:59;25:02;"Well, also, they must have had to like practice for a while."
25:02;25:04;"I wonder how long the set was."
25:04;25:05;"Do we have any intel on that?"
25:05;25:07;"I also wonder, was it like a 20 minute set?"
25:07;25:08;"I would love to see a set list."
25:08;25:09;"Or did they just like rock out?"
25:09;25:12;"Oh, yeah. Is the set list on setlist.fm?"
25:12;25:18;"I like to think about one of these like health care CEOs coming up to me and being like, hey, you guys going to play that song Brown Eyed Girl tonight?"
25:18;25:22;"I love that one."
25:22;25:27;"They played a 15 song set opening with Let's Spend the Night Together."
25:27;25:28;"Strong."
25:28;25:30;"Tumbling Dice, Under My Thumb."
25:30;25:33;"This was at the Patriots Stadium."
25:33;25:35;"This was at Gillette Stadium."
25:35;25:37;"This was an amazing set list so far."
25:37;25:38;"Yeah."
25:38;25:39;"Under My Thumb."
25:39;25:40;"Birthday Party at the Stadium."
25:40;25:41;"I mean, that's right."
25:41;25:43;"That's actually pretty tight."
25:43;25:46;"Gimme Shelter, Start Me Up, Miss You."
25:46;25:50;"I guess that's maybe a tribute."
25:50;25:55;"Jumpin' Jack Flash, Two Encore, Street Fighting Man, and Satisfaction."
25:55;25:58;"I'm getting an alternate set list."
25:58;26:02;"They dropped in a 19th Nervous Breakdown, first performance since 2005."
26:02;26:05;"Maybe Kraft requested that specifically."
26:05;26:06;"It's a good song."
26:06;26:07;"Okay."
26:07;26:08;"Yeah, I don't judge them."
26:08;26:10;"I mean, at least they were playing a stadium."
26:10;26:12;"[Laughter]"
26:12;26:13;"Wait, wait, wait."
26:13;26:14;"Mick tweeted--"
26:14;26:17;"First gig after Charlie playing an empty stadium."
26:17;26:18;"Hang on."
26:18;26:21;"Mick tweeted a clip if you want to see what it looks like."
26:21;26:24;"I'm sending it to the thread."
26:24;26:28;"I mean, also, I guess in COVID times, it's like, to be really charitable,"
26:28;26:32;"I could also picture a bunch of older dudes, high risk group for COVID."
26:32;26:33;"Sure, sure."
26:33;26:36;"Maybe Mick is like, I'm dying to go perform again."
26:36;26:41;"And I'm too scared to go do a giant tour, a classic Stones tour"
26:41;26:47;"to stadiums full of 80,000 people singing and spitting in my direction."
26:47;26:49;"Because I'm not going to wear a mask on stage."
26:49;26:54;"And the vaccine is less effective than hoped for."
26:54;26:55;"So maybe Mick is like--"
26:55;26:58;"Then his manager is like, well, you know, Bobby Kraft,"
26:58;27:00;"he's got this offer for you."
27:00;27:01;"Come out to Gillette Stadium."
27:01;27:03;"It's only going to be 300 people in the whole stadium."
27:03;27:05;"Mick's like, let's do it."
27:05;27:06;"COVID wanted us to."
27:06;27:11;"And everyone's going to be vaxxed or have a test or whatever."
27:11;27:13;"The CEO of Moderna is there."
27:13;27:15;"You could actually test 300 people."
27:15;27:16;"Yeah."
27:16;27:17;"I could see that."
27:17;27:18;"Yeah."
27:18;27:20;"And Bob Kraft's like-- and by the way, tell Mick and the guys,"
27:20;27:22;"I don't [BLEEP] around my guest list."
27:22;27:24;"These are serious people, CEO of Moderna."
27:24;27:27;"So you're wondering if people are going to be vaccinated?"
27:27;27:28;"Yeah, there's your answer."
27:28;27:31;"These are the big boys."
27:31;27:34;"Do you think he did a few personally?"
27:34;27:37;"I got booster shots over here."
27:37;27:38;"Get your booster."
27:38;27:40;"Just pass them around."
27:40;27:41;"Find a bar."
27:41;27:44;"Just give people booster shots."
27:44;27:45;"Oh, absolutely."
27:45;27:46;"It's the one-on-one."
27:46;27:50;"You do one shot of tequila, then you get your Moderna booster."
27:50;27:51;"Private Select."
27:51;27:52;"It's like a cut above."
27:52;27:55;"It's like a more pure formula."
27:55;27:57;"Exactly."
27:57;27:59;"Straight from the factory."
27:59;28:00;"Oh, God."
28:00;28:03;"That's such a creepy flex to be like,"
28:03;28:10;"""When I get vaccines, they're administered personally by the CEO of the company."""
28:10;28:12;"Not a trained--"
28:12;28:15;"[LAUGHTER]"
28:15;28:17;"Not a trained medical professional."
28:17;28:18;"You know what?"
28:18;28:19;"I bet that was a good vibe."
28:19;28:22;"Well, I like that we ended on a positive note with that."
28:22;28:25;"I brought it up in sort of a mocking way, and then we talked it through,"
28:25;28:28;"and we found the positive spin."
28:28;28:29;"Yeah, totally."
28:29;28:32;"And for all we know, when Charlie was alive, he was on the email thread,"
28:32;28:34;"and everybody was like, ""Who's in for this?"""
28:34;28:35;"And Charlie was like, ""Hell yeah."
28:35;28:37;"I've been wishing to perform, too."
28:37;28:39;"That sounds great, and I love Bobby Craft."
28:39;28:41;"I would love to honor the man."
28:41;28:42;"I'm so in."""
28:42;28:46;"And then, you know, life throws some curveballs, and, you know,"
28:46;28:48;"he's sicker than he thought."
28:48;28:50;"And maybe the guys were like, ""You know, Charlie wanted to do this gig."
28:50;28:52;"Let's go f---ing do it."""
28:52;28:56;"Charlie's a rock-solid drummer, very professional, always showing up."
28:56;28:59;"I wouldn't say they necessarily dishonored him."
28:59;29:01;"Maybe that's just the future of gigs."
29:01;29:03;"300 people in a stadium."
29:03;29:07;"Dark."
29:42;29:49;"So anyway, back to ABBA."
29:49;29:51;"They dropped two new singles."
29:51;29:53;"Well, I just got to also double-check."
29:53;29:54;"What does this mean that these are--?"
29:54;29:58;"Okay, we need some backstory, because there is something where it's like,"
29:58;30:01;"I guess they have a new album called Voyage."
30:01;30:05;"Both songs were recorded in 2018 and were planned as single releases."
30:05;30:09;"However, ABBA expanded the singles into an album called Voyage."
30:09;30:11;"Okay, so am I missing any element of this?"
30:11;30:16;"Because I know that they're planning a tour that they won't actually perform in."
30:16;30:17;"Right?"
30:17;30:19;"They're doing a tour, a hologram tour?"
30:19;30:20;"Really?"
30:20;30:23;"Promotion for the album will include a concert series where the band will"
30:23;30:26;"perform as digital avatars of their younger selves,"
30:26;30:31;"performing as they looked in 1979, three years before the band split."
30:31;30:35;"Yeah, they were like, ""What era should we choose for our bodies?"
30:35;30:39;"Should we just pick up '82, year after?"""
30:39;30:41;"And they're just like, ""Let's dial back a few years."""
30:41;30:42;"Let's go to the prime."
30:42;30:44;"""Make it '79. We're in our f***ing peak."""
30:44;30:46;"That's real Black Mirror stuff."
30:46;30:50;"The musicians spent five weeks performing 22 songs in the 90-minute setlist"
30:50;30:53;"in order for the crew to capture every mannerism in motion"
30:53;30:55;"with performance capture techniques."
30:55;30:57;"So it's a little bit of an Irishman thing."
30:57;31:00;"They're going to de-age them."
31:00;31:01;"Oh, yeah."
31:01;31:04;"Like, they're new performances, but then they're de-aged."
31:04;31:05;"Right."
31:05;31:09;"And then I don't understand, if you go to the show, what are you looking at?"
31:09;31:11;"You're just at a hologram?"
31:11;31:13;"You're looking at holograms."
31:13;31:15;"I've never seen one of those in person."
31:15;31:18;"Well, you've seen the pictures of the first one that most people saw,"
31:18;31:21;"which was a Tupac hologram at Coachella."
31:21;31:22;"Right."
31:22;31:25;"But you know, the hologram appears to be life-size on the stage."
31:25;31:27;"Right. I mean, it looked like a hologram."
31:27;31:28;"It didn't-- Yeah."
31:28;31:30;"Well, it looks like someone's walking around,"
31:30;31:31;"but the idea is that--"
31:31;31:34;"I mean, as weird as it is to bring back someone from the dead,"
31:34;31:38;"there's something very weird about just wanting to go back to your prime"
31:38;31:39;"when you're alive."
31:39;31:40;"It's heavy."
31:40;31:41;"Yeah."
31:41;31:44;"A team of 850 people from Industrial Light & Magic"
31:44;31:46;"are building the concert experience"
31:46;31:49;"using the same technology used in Star Wars and Lord of the Rings."
31:49;31:50;"Whoa."
31:50;31:53;"The band thought their motion capture suits were so cool,"
31:53;31:56;"they released press photos of the members wearing them."
31:56;31:57;"Yeah, this is weird."
31:57;31:59;"I mean, this is going to be a big deal."
31:59;32:01;"I wonder if it's going to do well."
32:01;32:05;"Well, it says the band's TikTok account amassed 991,000 followers"
32:05;32:08;"and 5.5 million likes two days after creating the account."
32:08;32:11;"So I think the appetite for ABBA is there."
32:11;32:13;"I think they span the generations."
32:13;32:15;"People are going to roll out."
32:15;32:18;"Yeah, they've been marketing stuff for decades, as discussed,"
32:18;32:21;"so maybe they're feeling confident about this."
32:21;32:23;"You know, it raises an interesting--"
32:23;32:24;"Yeah?"
32:24;32:26;"I was going to say, it raises an interesting question"
32:26;32:28;"because if you're in a massive show"
32:28;32:31;"and you're sitting nowhere near the performer,"
32:31;32:35;"it's like, are you there to be in the same room"
32:35;32:38;"as Stevie Nicks or Mick Jagger or whatever?"
32:38;32:42;"Or is it just to experience the music and the vibe and--"
32:42;32:43;"The atmosphere."
32:43;32:47;"--and the whole festival element of it?"
32:47;32:50;"This really pushes that question to the fore"
32:50;32:53;"because you're not in the same room with the ABBA people"
32:53;32:56;"and then you're watching a movie, basically."
32:56;33:00;"Yeah, you're watching a 3D immersive film."
33:00;33:01;"Yeah."
33:01;33:02;"But I was just thinking,"
33:02;33:06;"you know who's going to be watching the whole rollout very closely,"
33:06;33:08;"seeing what works, what doesn't work,"
33:08;33:10;"how this plays out is Mick Jagger."
33:10;33:12;"I'm sure he heard about this and is just like,"
33:12;33:14;"""I want to know everything about this,"""
33:14;33:16;"because I'm sure he's a little bit split"
33:16;33:19;"because on the one hand, Mick is out there--"
33:19;33:23;"Famously, he goes just as hard, if not harder, on stage"
33:23;33:25;"as he's gotten older."
33:25;33:27;"So for him, it's kind of like a badge of honor"
33:27;33:31;"that it is flesh and blood, Mick Jagger,"
33:31;33:34;"same physique, same moves, same voice,"
33:34;33:36;"and that he's out there doing it."
33:36;33:39;"And I wonder if he looks at this and he's like,"
33:39;33:42;"""This is satanic. This is cheating."""
33:42;33:44;"Or if he looks at it and says, ""Hmm,"
33:44;33:46;"""I could get into some of this s--t."""
33:46;33:47;"He's a shrewd businessman."
33:47;33:49;"He just played Bob Craft's Birthday."
33:49;33:50;"Yeah."
33:50;33:52;"This really is like, ""Okay, we're going to--"
33:52;33:53;"""When the classic rock--"
33:53;33:56;"""When the final classic rock icons are dead,"
33:56;33:58;"""this is how it'll continue."""
33:58;34:00;"We will be living with the music"
34:00;34:03;"of all of those '60s and '70s legends"
34:03;34:05;"for the rest of our lives."
34:05;34:07;"They could do a whole digital Woodstock."
34:07;34:09;"It looks like there has been some prototype"
34:09;34:11;"of a Mick Jagger hologram."
34:11;34:15;"Five years ago, the hologram--"
34:15;34:17;"A company called Hologram USA"
34:17;34:19;"that did the Tupac hologram"
34:19;34:21;"did a showcase at,"
34:21;34:23;"looks like, the Beverly Hills Hotel."
34:23;34:25;"Mick Jagger, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson,"
34:25;34:27;"Frank Sinatra, and Jimmy Kimmel"
34:27;34:28;"were all part of this."
34:28;34:30;"So I assume that Mick Jagger"
34:30;34:32;"would have had to give his permission"
34:32;34:34;"for his likeness to be used for this."
34:34;34:37;"Hmm. Mick likes the tech."
34:37;34:39;"He's not ready to sign on for the live tour,"
34:39;34:41;"but Mick likes the tech."
34:41;34:43;"And I'd love to get you guys in a room together"
34:43;34:46;"just to--you know, he'd love to pick your brain."
34:46;34:48;"So, you know, let's talk again next month"
34:48;34:50;"'cause Mick likes the tech."
34:50;34:51;"[laughs]"
34:51;34:52;"How about this?"
34:52;34:53;"They could start to phase it in"
34:53;34:56;"where after the Bobcraft birthday party,"
34:56;34:58;"Mick is realizing, you know,"
34:58;35:00;"coronavirus, it's endemic,"
35:00;35:01;"it's not going anywhere."
35:01;35:03;"He says, ""How about this?"
35:03;35:06;"""We play a stadium the night before."
35:06;35:08;"""We build the stage, bring all the gear,"
35:08;35:10;"""all the sh*t we need,"
35:10;35:12;"""and we play the stadium one night"
35:12;35:14;"""for 300 CEOs."""
35:14;35:16;"People could shell out, you know,"
35:16;35:19;"$500,000 a ticket, a million dollars, whatever."
35:19;35:20;"And then the next night,"
35:20;35:23;"you can fill the stadium to the f*cking rafters"
35:23;35:26;"and we'll have the digital avatars play."
35:26;35:29;"I'm on to the next city, enjoying myself,"
35:29;35:32;"and, you know, repeat over and over again."
35:32;35:34;"And the optics of that are really bad."
35:34;35:36;"Yeah, I mean, Mick and Keith are not going to play"
35:36;35:38;"for those savages anymore."
35:38;35:40;"Yeah, it's like, let those guys get the virus."
35:40;35:43;"The publicist is going to raise the point you just raised."
35:43;35:45;"But, you know, lucky for us,"
35:45;35:46;"and the Stones organization,"
35:46;35:49;"we have the COVID-19 pandemic."
35:49;35:52;"You want these legends, these absolute legends,"
35:52;35:54;"to go perform in a risky environment?"
35:54;35:55;"No, no, no."
35:55;35:57;"They could not possibly perform"
35:57;35:59;"for more than 300 people in a stadium"
35:59;36:01;"in flesh and blood."
36:01;36:02;"And of course, those 300 people"
36:02;36:04;"are going to have to be extraordinarily wealthy."
36:04;36:08;"But we do care so much about our average Joe fans,"
36:08;36:10;"the people who made the Stones what they are,"
36:10;36:13;"that we have invested heavily in new technology"
36:13;36:16;"to give them the show of their life the night after."
36:16;36:17;"Everybody wins."
36:17;36:20;"It breaks our hearts that we can't go play for you,"
36:20;36:22;"but I think they could sell it."
36:22;36:23;"And they could probably figure out a way"
36:23;36:24;"to make even more money that way."
36:24;36:28;"I think Mick and Keith have been secretly recording concerts"
36:28;36:32;"on a soundstage in case one of them goes."
36:32;36:34;"And that way, it's sort of like people"
36:34;36:36;"who freeze their genetic material"
36:36;36:38;"for possible reproduction in the future."
36:38;36:42;"This way, you know, they have their performances"
36:42;36:45;"and people then can, after they're gone,"
36:45;36:46;"turn them into holograms"
36:46;36:49;"and the Stones can live forever."
36:49;36:52;"I think it's already happened in a bunker underground."
36:52;36:54;"And certainly all their kids will be interested"
36:54;36:57;"in keeping the memory alive."
36:57;36:58;"I mean, that's a great idea."
36:58;37:03;"I mean, if there's just like 600 new live versions"
37:03;37:05;"and they can just go on after they're dead"
37:05;37:06;"and every time you go,"
37:06;37:08;"""Well, we've never seen this version before."""
37:08;37:12;"Yeah, they have to do like every song in their catalog."
37:12;37:13;"So they can really mix it up."
37:13;37:17;"They've got to do like variations on stage banter."
37:17;37:18;"I bet they're already working on this."
37:18;37:20;"I bet they've been working on this for years, secretly."
37:20;37:24;"I wonder if they could create an AI Jerry"
37:24;37:26;"that would actually like jams."
37:26;37:28;"Solo like Jerry?"
37:28;37:31;"Yeah, never before heard jams."
37:31;37:32;"You could totally do that."
37:32;37:36;"John Perry Barlow, love technology and the internet."
37:36;37:38;"Jerry loves the tech."
37:38;37:39;"Jerry loves the tech."
37:39;37:44;"(laughing)"
37:44;37:46;"But let's get to the songs."
37:46;37:47;"Yeah, okay."
37:47;37:48;"So I just want to double check"
37:48;37:51;"that the songs are not AI generated or something."
37:51;37:53;"This tour is kind of on some new tech,"
37:53;37:57;"but these songs were made traditionally ABBA style."
37:57;38:00;"They're written, I assume by Bjorn and Benny."
38:00;38:02;"Okay, here we go."
38:02;38:04;"Quote from guitarist Bjorn."
38:04;38:06;"""The first song, 'I Still Have Faith In You,'"
38:06;38:08;"when Benny Anderson played the melody,"
38:08;38:10;"I knew it just had to be out of us."
38:10;38:12;"It's about relaxing."
38:12;38:14;"That's inconceivable to be where we are."""
38:14;38:15;"I don't know what he's saying."
38:15;38:17;"""No imagination could dream that up."""
38:17;38:18;"I don't know."
38:18;38:19;"That was a kind of incoherent quote,"
38:19;38:22;"but basically he heard his friend play a melody"
38:22;38:24;"and he was like, ""Let's do this."""
38:24;38:25;"Oh, and I like this part."
38:25;38:28;"""To release a new album after 40 years"
38:28;38:29;"and still be the best of friends"
38:29;38:31;"and still be enjoying each other's company"
38:31;38:32;"and have total loyalty?"
38:32;38:34;"Who has experienced that?"
38:34;38:35;"Nobody."""
38:35;38:36;"Okay."
38:36;38:37;"Nobody."
38:37;38:38;"So Bjorn and Benny still going strong."
38:38;38:40;"You know, probably because"
38:40;38:42;"they went into the business business."
38:42;38:43;"They got out of the music business"
38:43;38:45;"and they went into the business business"
38:45;38:46;"in a timely fashion."
38:46;38:47;"All right, throw it on."
38:47;38:49;"Let's hear ""I Still Have Faith In You."""

41:36;41:40;"Yeah, they're not trying to, like, keep up with new trends."

41:45;41:47;"Oh, my God."
41:47;41:49;"Guess verse from Post Malone."

41:58;42:01;"This reminds me kind of like of, like, late Bruce Springsteen."
42:01;42:05;"He still knows how to make songs that have the energy of, like,"
42:05;42:10;"when Bruce still drops the glockenspiel in, like, a 2010s-era song."
42:10;42:13;"You're like, ""All right, yeah, you're still right in that tradition."
42:13;42:15;"It sounds like you."""
42:15;42:17;"I mean, these melodies are so ABBA."
42:17;42:20;"Yeah, if you told me that they started writing this song back then,"
42:20;42:21;"I'd totally believe it."
42:21;42:26;"And it makes sense that, like, they could still write the same exact sort of melodies"
42:26;42:28;"that they could 40 years ago."
42:28;42:32;"They're maybe not performed with the same, like, intensity,"
42:32;42:34;"although those choruses sound--"
42:34;42:35;"Yeah, although I like--"
42:35;42:38;"Choruses sound like classic, soaring ABBA."
42:38;42:39;"The voices sound great."
42:39;42:40;"Yeah."
42:40;42:42;"And it has a little bit of, like, an older--"
42:42;42:45;"you can tell the slightly richer quality."
42:45;42:48;"Yeah, the verse, she's seen really in that, like, low register,"
42:48;42:51;"which strikes me as very, like, older person,"
42:51;42:55;"like late period Dylan or something, or late Leonard Cohen."
42:55;42:56;"Just, like, so low."
42:56;42:57;"Yeah."
43:28;43:30;"What a set of pipes."
43:30;43:31;"Yeah."
43:31;43:32;"Truly--"
43:32;43:36;"Is it Agnetha was kind of, like, the lead singer?"
43:36;43:40;"I don't even know the names of the people in the band, I've got to be honest."
43:40;43:45;"Well, one way to remember it is that ABBA is their initials, A-B-B-A."
43:45;43:46;"Oh, wow."
43:46;43:47;"I'm sure I'm not--"
43:47;43:52;"Apologies to any Swedish people, but it's Agnetha, or maybe Agnetha, Bjorn,"
43:52;43:54;"Benny, and Anni-Frid."
43:54;43:55;"Hmm."
43:55;43:58;"But, yeah, Agnetha, just truly a magical performer."
43:58;44:01;"And I feel like she gets left out of the conversation a little bit,"
44:01;44:03;"because she was, like, you know, in this group,"
44:03;44:05;"but truly one of the best pop vocalists of all time."
44:05;44:07;"And she still sounds great."
44:07;44:11;"I want to go have a close listen by myself later, really."
44:11;44:15;"Go take a long walk, feel the autumn breeze,"
44:15;44:18;"and really take in that song, because I liked what I heard."
44:18;44:21;"And also, it's a moving sentiment, first single in 40 years,"
44:21;44:23;"and what did you come back to say?"
44:23;44:24;"I still have faith in you."
44:24;44:27;"Well, Abba, we still have faith in you,"
44:27;44:30;"and so does the younger generation, because we taught them well."
44:30;44:33;"We taught them to be fans of you, and we will be there."
44:33;44:37;"Grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren"
44:37;44:41;"will be there all together to watch your digital avatars perform"
44:41;44:43;"in stadiums across the world."
44:43;44:47;"They refer to those avatars as ""abatars,"" just to add a little color."
44:47;44:50;"The universe wanted it to happen, avatars."
44:50;44:55;"I wonder also, given that Bjorn and Benny seem like such keen investors"
44:55;44:58;"and business people, I wonder if they own any of the tech."
44:58;45:01;"Maybe they're reaching out to Mick and just being like,"
45:01;45:03;"""Mick, come down, see the rehearsals."
45:03;45:05;"You're going to want a piece of this."
45:05;45:07;"We'll give you a deal."""
45:07;45:09;"All right, should we listen to the other one, ""Don't Shut Me Down""?"
45:09;45:11;"I'm way down."
45:11;45:15;"A while ago I heard the sound of children's laughter"
45:15;45:20;"Now it's quiet, so I guess they left the park"
45:20;45:24;"This wooden bench is getting harder by the hour"
45:24;45:28;"The sun is going down, it's getting dark"
45:28;45:31;"This is pretty one-of-us energy."
45:31;45:33;"The rain begins to pour"
45:33;45:35;"As I watch the windows shut"
45:35;45:39;"So is it the same singer that sings lead on all the songs?"
45:39;45:41;"I think she almost always sang lead."
45:41;45:43;"I see."
45:43;45:48;"It's time at last to let him know"
45:48;45:50;"Oh, yes!"
45:50;45:52;"Hell yeah."
45:52;45:59;"This could have been on the last Daft Punk album."
45:59;46:04;"Or like, Ace of Base."
46:04;46:07;"That light-speeded reggae."
46:07;46:10;"And you wonder why I'm here today"
46:11;46:13;"And so you should, I would"
46:13;46:20;"When I left I felt I'd had enough"
46:20;46:26;"But in this shape and form I appear now"
46:26;46:29;"I have lived and hoped and loved and hoped"
46:29;46:33;"It's why I am here now"
46:36;46:41;"And now you see another me I've been reloading, yeah"
46:41;46:45;"I'm fired up, don't shut me down"
46:45;46:50;"I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded"
46:50;46:54;"I'm fired up, I'm hooked, don't shut me down"
46:54;46:57;"I'm not the one you knew"
46:57;46:59;"I'm now a mental mind"
46:59;47:02;"And I'm asking you to let me know"
47:02;47:05;"I mean, it's very obvious, but I've never had this conscious thought."
47:05;47:09;"But Abba was like the European counterpart to the Bee Gees."
47:09;47:12;"I just never even... Duh!"
47:12;47:14;"It's so Saturday Night Fever vibe."
47:14;47:17;"And like those high, those beautiful high harmonies."
47:17;47:22;"Yeah, arguably the Bee Gees have a similar relationship to Australia"
47:22;47:25;"that Abba has to Sweden."
47:25;47:28;"True. National heroes."
47:28;47:30;"Yeah."
47:34;47:37;"The apartment hasn't changed at all"
47:37;47:40;"I've got to say I'm glad"
47:40;47:44;"I like the thing about the Bee Gees and AC/DC hanging out at some point."
47:44;47:48;"Just like Australian rock royalty."
47:48;47:52;"Yeah, probably the first ten years of AC/DC it never would have happened."
47:52;47:56;"But then by the 90s they're basically all just rich people at the same party."
47:56;47:58;"Totally."
47:58;48:01;"Just Angus Young being like..."
48:01;48:04;"Barry, where do you keep your boat, man?"
48:04;48:07;"I'm having a hell of a time finding a good regatta in Sydney."
48:07;48:10;"Or in the Melbourne area."
48:10;48:12;"Keep it real with me, man."
48:12;48:16;"During the 80s I got behind on my dues with the Sydney Yacht Club."
48:16;48:19;"And turned into a whole situation."
48:19;48:22;"And I'm looking for a new spot."
48:22;48:25;"Yeah, don't make the mistakes I made, dude."
48:25;48:30;"I'm asking you to have an open mind"
48:30;48:35;"I've got to say this time around"
48:35;48:40;"I'm fired up, don't shut me down"
48:40;48:45;"Ask me not to leave when here I am again"
48:45;48:50;"And I've got this feeling so I won't pretend"
48:50;48:55;"Seinfeld, are these songs ripping up the charts? At least in Sweden?"
48:55;49:00;"Yeah, these two singles, they've raced to the top of the streaming charts."
49:00;49:07;"They were first and third place on YouTube's trending rankings in 12 countries."
49:07;49:11;"On Friday, September 3rd, including the UK."
49:11;49:16;"4.4 million views for the first one we listened to. 1.4 million."
49:16;49:21;"Ok, I still have faith in you made it to number 2 on the Swedish charts."
49:21;49:23;"That's gotta feel good."
49:23;49:25;"Also number 3 in Germany."
49:25;49:28;"I guess that was the A side and Don't Shut Me Down was the B side."
49:28;49:31;"Oh no, Don't Shut Me Down made it to number 1 in Sweden."
49:31;49:36;"So ABBA had the number 1 and number 2 song in Sweden that week."
49:36;49:42;"They also broke Universal Music UK's record for biggest ever pre-order with this album."
49:42;49:46;"Wow, first album in 40 years. Unreal."
49:46;49:51;"Excited, we're going to be keeping our eyes on the whole rollout here at Time Crisis."
49:51;49:53;"ABBA, we're behind you."
49:53;49:59;"I bet they got a hell of a backlog of songs like, ""Oh man, I wrote this great melody 12 years ago."""
49:59;50:00;"Oh yeah, totally."
50:00;50:02;"I don't know where to put it, you know what I mean?"
50:02;50:04;"They probably amassed so much great material."
50:04;50:07;"Just busting out a 4-track tape from '95."
50:07;50:08;"Yeah."
50:08;50:13;"Just like, ""Oh yeah, this one. This one's great. This is going to be a monster album."""
50:13;50:17;"Oh yeah, 40 years of material just picking the cream of the crop."
50:17;50:19;"I cannot wait for Voyage."
50:19;50:22;"Alright, when's this dropping? November. Okay."
50:22;50:23;"Alright, what's it be?"
50:23;50:25;"I'm sure we'll get some more singles before then."
50:25;50:28;"Can you hear the drums, Fernando?"
50:28;50:35;"I remember long ago another starry night like this"
50:35;50:41;"In the choir like Fernando"
50:41;50:46;"You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar"
50:46;50:53;"I could hear the disco drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar"
50:54;50:58;"They were close now Fernando"
50:58;51:04;"Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally"
51:04;51:10;"I was so afraid Fernando"
51:10;51:15;"We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die"
51:15;51:23;"And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry"
51:23;51:27;"There was something in the air that night"
51:27;51:31;"The stars were bright Fernando"
51:31;51:36;"They were shining there for you and me"
51:36;51:40;"For liberty, Fernando"
51:40;51:44;"Though we never thought that we could lose"
51:44;51:47;"There's no regret"
51:47;51:51;"If I had to do the same again"
51:51;51:56;"I would, my friend, Fernando"
51:56;52:00;"If I had to do the same again"
52:00;52:04;"I would, my friend, Fernando"
52:04;52:07;"Okay, so I just want to read this email real quick."
52:07;52:09;"We got a cool email from Brandon."
52:09;52:11;"It's called Soul Movie Number Crunch."
52:11;52:15;"Hello Crisis Crew. When I looked up my soul movie, it was Titanic."
52:15;52:18;"And I remember that was one of the longest running movies at number one."
52:18;52:20;"So I ran a soul movie number crunch."
52:20;52:23;"Titanic was at number one for 15 weeks straight."
52:23;52:28;"So everyone born at the end of 1987 or the first quarter of 1988 has the same soul movie."
52:28;52:32;"It's important people. Sometimes you're going to share your soul movie with a lot of people."
52:32;52:36;"You could consider that lucky, unlucky, look at it however you want."
52:36;52:40;"But if you were born 10 years before a major hit film,"
52:40;52:43;"you're going to share the same soul movie as a lot of people."
52:43;52:46;"So Brandon looked up who he shared a soul movie with."
52:46;52:50;"It includes people like Rihanna, FKA Twigs, Big Sean, and Steph Curry."
52:50;52:54;"I wonder how sharing Titanic as a soul movie has influenced all of us."
52:54;53:00;"Well, it's, you know, if Brandon, it's kind of like, you know, it's like astrology or something."
53:00;53:03;"Does your sign and your moon and all those things influence your life?"
53:03;53:07;"Yes, to a big extent. Does that mean you don't have free will?"
53:07;53:12;"Of course not. People with the same sign, born at the same time, same place, same soul movie."
53:12;53:14;"There's going to be room for deviation."
53:14;53:18;"But the fact that Rihanna, FKA Twigs, Big Sean, and Steph Curry all have the same soul movie."
53:18;53:21;"I mean, I think that says something right there."
53:21;53:25;"They're all incredibly popular people, entertainers."
53:25;53:27;"Steph Curry is an athlete."
53:27;53:30;"He looked up what other soul movies had long stretches at number one."
53:30;53:32;"ET had a lot of weeks at number one in '82."
53:32;53:36;"So a lot of people born in '72 are going to have ET as their soul movie."
53:36;53:40;"From December 9th, '84 to March 3rd, '85, Beverly Hills Cop was number one,"
53:40;53:45;"making it the soul movie of Dax Shepard, Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk,"
53:45;53:51;"Bradley Cooper, Big Boy from Outkast, Wes Borland from Limp Bizkit, and Drew Barrymore."
53:51;53:53;"Esteemed company there."
53:53;53:56;"All those people do have a lot in common."
53:56;54:01;"From November 18th, 1990 to February 3rd, 1991, Home Alone was the number one movie."
54:01;54:06;"It was the soul movie to Ryan Gosling, Christina Aguilera, Jake Gyllenhaal, Eliza Dusko,"
54:06;54:12;"rapper Mike Jones, Jared Kushner, Pitbull, Alicia Keys, Elijah Wood, and Justin Timberlake."
54:12;54:15;"That's some of the data. Now I'll turn it to you guys for analysis."
54:15;54:17;"Brandon from Phoenix. This is a great email."
54:17;54:22;"It doesn't surprise me that Ryan Gosling and Jared Kushner would have the same soul movie."
54:22;54:26;"I mean, just look. You get that essence, that soul essence."
54:26;54:30;"And the fact that it was Home Alone, I mean, we could spend hours talking about it,"
54:30;54:34;"but we have to get in the top five because we have a very special guest."
54:34;54:39;"We've got actress, writer, director, producer, Rashida Jones."
54:39;54:41;"She's calling back in for the top five."
54:41;54:48;"And if anybody remembers, she was on in late 2020 for the top five."
54:48;54:54;"And when she comes through, we tend to turn it into a Gen X top five, rock versus R&B thing"
54:54;55:00;"because two of the most important Gen X people in my life are Rashida and Jake."
55:00;55:04;"Jake's more of a rock guy. She's more of a R&B fan."
55:04;55:09;"It's perfect. It's a great way to get two Gen X icons together."
55:09;55:15;"But it's important to note that, you know, the people who make the art for a generation,"
55:15;55:19;"they tend to be almost a little bit out of that generation."
55:19;55:22;"A true Gen Xer was listening to that music."
55:22;55:26;"I mean, the people making that music, they were like borderline boomers."
55:26;55:29;"Some of them are very early Gen X."
55:29;55:36;"Just like we've discussed, the big boomer rock stars were actually all born before the baby boom started."
55:36;55:38;"They were wartime babies."
55:38;55:40;"Yeah, we're babies."
55:40;55:42;"But anyway, let's welcome her back to the program."
55:42;55:47;"Let's get Rashida on the horn and we'll get into a very special Gen X top five."
55:47;55:52;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
55:52;55:55;"What's up?"
55:55;55:58;"Hi, welcome back to the program."
55:58;56:02;"So my first question for you, do you know what a soul movie is?"
56:02;56:04;"A soul movie?"
56:04;56:07;"Yeah, it's a very important concept to me at least."
56:07;56:09;"Like a black exploitation movie?"
56:09;56:12;"Oh, interesting guess, no."
56:12;56:16;"Well, your soul movie, for instance, is Down and Out in Beverly Hills."
56:16;56:18;"Does that movie mean anything to you?"
56:18;56:21;"Oh, it's like the year I was something?"
56:21;56:26;"Yes, it's the number one movie the year you turned 10."
56:26;56:28;"Oh, interesting."
56:28;56:30;"Yeah, that movie does mean something to me."
56:30;56:31;"I love that movie."
56:31;56:33;"Down and Out in Beverly Hills?"
56:33;56:35;"Yeah, I've actually never seen it."
56:35;56:37;"I love the makeover scene."
56:37;56:38;"I like the makeover scene of any movie."
56:38;56:40;"Who gets a makeover in that movie?"
56:40;56:45;"You know, Nick Nolte, because he's down and out and then they fix him up."
56:45;56:47;"Oh, have you guys ever seen this movie?"
56:47;56:48;"Oh, really?"
56:48;56:49;"No, not familiar."
56:49;56:51;"Is he like a bum and they fix him?"
56:51;56:52;"Yeah."
56:52;56:53;"He's like, ""Oh, I'm Nick Nolte."""
56:53;56:55;"You know, just weird gravity."
56:55;56:56;"I was trying to do a Nolte."
56:56;57:00;"It's a terrible class-dis movie."
57:00;57:03;"Is this like a Dirty Rotten Scoundrels vibe almost?"
57:03;57:06;"No, no, it's more earnest than that, because he's like,"
57:06;57:08;"""I can't remember everything because I was 10."""
57:08;57:13;"But he gets a makeover and then I feel like whatever crazy rich family"
57:13;57:17;"I remember the wife has the hots for him and tries to--"
57:17;57:19;"Played by Bette Midler."
57:19;57:21;"Oh, yeah. It's been a long time."
57:21;57:22;"From what I can see."
57:22;57:24;"Well, anyway, so that's your soul movie."
57:24;57:29;"Are you aware of the kind of political implications of the soul movie?"
57:29;57:30;"No."
57:30;57:32;"I haven't told you about any of this?"
57:32;57:34;"No. Have we met?"
57:34;57:37;"Have you been keeping up with Time Crisis?"
57:37;57:39;"That's maybe my mistake. No."
57:39;57:42;"Did you miss out on the last 10 episodes?"
57:42;57:43;"No."
57:43;57:46;"Earlier this year, the Biden administration announced"
57:46;57:50;"that you had to go watch or re-watch your soul movie"
57:50;57:53;"by the end of 2021."
57:53;57:54;"It's a mandate."
57:54;57:57;"Oh, wow. Like a vaccine mandate plus watch that movie."
57:57;57:59;"He's been a little bit vague about exactly why,"
57:59;58:03;"but he's brought it up many times in some of his speeches."
58:03;58:06;"And he's even in some of his meetings in the past couple weeks"
58:06;58:10;"with all the world leaders coming to the U.S. for the UN Assembly."
58:10;58:13;"He's also trying to encourage Boris Johnson to implement it in the U.K."
58:13;58:15;"He wants it to be a global thing,"
58:15;58:17;"but it's very important that you got to watch your soul movie"
58:17;58:19;"or re-watch it by the end of the year."
58:19;58:20;"I have a question about that."
58:20;58:21;"Yeah."
58:21;58:23;"If you're from the U.K., do you watch the movie"
58:23;58:26;"that was number one in the country that you were raised in?"
58:26;58:29;"That's a bit of a diplomatic issue."
58:29;58:31;"I don't think they've fully hashed it out yet."
58:31;58:33;"Right. It'll be interesting to see what happens."
58:33;58:36;"I mean, I think he said it was a project towards national unity."
58:36;58:39;"People from all different political stripes"
58:39;58:41;"are going to share the same soul movie."
58:41;58:43;"And if everyone watches their soul movie"
58:43;58:46;"and then they talk to someone from across the aisle"
58:46;58:51;"who shares that soul movie, then you can bond."
58:51;58:54;"It's like they used to get drinks after work."
58:54;58:56;"All the congressmen used to do that."
58:56;58:57;"So now it's the soul movie."
58:57;58:58;"Right."
58:58;59:01;"Maybe Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer have the same soul movie."
59:01;59:03;"Exactly. And people love talking about movies."
59:03;59:04;"That's what I was thinking."
59:04;59:06;"I think that's part of it."
59:06;59:09;"Also, to bring you up to speed, have you heard the new ABBA singles?"
59:09;59:11;"No, I have not."
59:11;59:12;"I'm going to play them for you later."
59:12;59:14;"They're pretty good, actually."
59:14;59:17;"They just dropped their first two singles in 40 years."
59:17;59:23;"Wow. And are they similar in genre and production quality"
59:23;59:26;"as the thing that they're beloved for?"
59:26;59:27;"Very much."
59:27;59:30;"It's as if the 40 years didn't even happen."
59:30;59:32;"It really sounds like classic ABBA."
59:32;59:34;"People need that right now."
59:34;59:36;"Don't they?"
59:36;59:39;"It really is. It's moving hearing that again."
59:39;59:41;"And you're a fan, right?"
59:41;59:43;"I am a fan. Yeah. I don't have a deep..."
59:43;59:46;"I'm not a Mamma Mia head, you know?"
59:46;59:50;"But I love Sweden."
59:50;59:53;"And I really enjoy their music. I find it very fun."
59:53;59:57;"But I know from you that it has a lot of dark undertones."
59:57;59:59;"Have you been to the ABBA museum?"
59:59;01:00:01;"No, I haven't."
01:00:01;01:00:03;"All right. Bucket list."
01:00:03;01:00:09;"It's time for the Top 5 on iTunes."
01:00:09;01:00:12;"So Gen X Top 5."
01:00:12;01:00:16;"We got two unimpeachable Gen Xers here."
01:00:16;01:00:20;"American Painter and radio host, radio personality,"
01:00:20;01:00:23;"Jake Longstreth, actress, director, producer,"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"writer Rashida Jones."
01:00:25;01:00:30;"And we're doing R&B versus rock, but everybody can chime in."
01:00:30;01:00:32;"I don't even remember. Did we have rules?"
01:00:32;01:00:35;"I'm just trying to basically see if you guys recognize this."
01:00:35;01:00:37;"Yeah. We were just vibing."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"We were just vibing."
01:00:39;01:00:41;"I mean, look, this is a Gen X event."
01:00:41;01:00:46;"We can't bring that kind of hardcore competitive atmosphere"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"of millennials or Gen Z."
01:00:48;01:00:51;"It's a Gen X. It's a laid back Gen X event."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"No rules."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"It's detached. It's ironic. It's unaffected."
01:00:55;01:00:58;"The only rule is no selling out."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"I don't want to see either one of you guys sell out"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"during this time."
01:01:02;01:01:04;"I wouldn't dream of it."
01:01:04;01:01:07;"Okay. Great."
01:01:07;01:01:09;"Okay. So we're going to start with the R&B chart."
01:01:09;01:01:15;"This was number 5 on the R&B chart this week in 1992."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"Good luck, Jake."
01:01:17;01:01:19;"Good luck to you."
01:01:19;01:01:23;"Yes, I got it."
01:01:23;01:01:24;"Yeah?"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"Oh, that's right. We tried to name it."
01:01:26;01:01:29;"Everyday People. Arrested Development?"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"Yes."
01:01:30;01:01:32;"Everyday People?"
01:01:32;01:01:35;"Yeah. Although, interestingly, because they sample"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"Sly and the Family Stones' Everyday People,"
01:01:37;01:01:40;"they called this song People Every Day."
01:01:40;01:01:41;"Smart."
01:01:41;01:01:43;"Yeah."
01:01:43;01:01:53;"You know this song, Jake?"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"Yeah. I remember this."
01:01:55;01:01:57;"I remember the video."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"It's so much slower than I remember."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"I remember being confused when the television show"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"Arrested Development started."
01:02:03;01:02:06;"Because I wasn't familiar with the term Arrested Development"
01:02:06;01:02:09;"as a larger kind of cultural term."
01:02:09;01:02:11;"I just thought there was..."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"Why is this named after the hip-hop group?"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"Yeah. I thought there was a rap group called Arrested Development."
01:02:15;01:02:17;"I was like, ""That's kind of a cool name."""
01:02:17;01:02:21;"I think this is a remix."
01:02:21;01:02:22;"It doesn't sound quite the same."
01:02:22;01:02:24;"It's not the original."
01:02:24;01:02:26;"That's funny because sometimes when we're doing the top 5"
01:02:26;01:02:29;"60s stuff, there'll be an awkward re-record"
01:02:29;01:02:31;"because someone didn't have the rights."
01:02:31;01:02:35;"It's funny to start thinking about that happening with 90s stuff."
01:02:35;01:02:44;"I'm waiting for that sample to come in."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"Yeah."
01:02:45;01:02:47;"It's not going to happen. It's the wrong version."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"Wait, but eventually..."
01:02:49;01:02:51;"Maybe..."
01:02:51;01:02:53;"Eventually, it'll come in."
01:02:53;01:02:55;"Sly Stone will come in and go..."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"Oh."
01:02:57;01:02:59;"Oh, there we go."
01:02:59;01:03:07;"I'm going to just say this is a different version and it's slower."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"Yeah, I was going to say this sounds very slow."
01:03:09;01:03:11;"And the beat is different."
01:03:11;01:03:12;"All right, Matt."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"Can we verify that this is..."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"A 2012 re-record?"
01:03:16;01:03:19;"We got multiple Gen Xers"
01:03:19;01:03:21;"saying this is the sell-out version."
01:03:23;01:03:25;"This is the version that's on Apple Music."
01:03:25;01:03:29;"Very corporate answer there."
01:03:29;01:03:33;"This is the version that's on Apple Music."
01:03:33;01:03:35;"But is it the original version?"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"This is the version that's on Apple Music."
01:03:37;01:03:39;"It is the version from the album."
01:03:39;01:03:41;"Okay, so this is the album version."
01:03:41;01:03:42;"Maybe the remix was the..."
01:03:42;01:03:43;"The single version."
01:03:43;01:03:45;"Maybe there's a single that was different."
01:03:45;01:03:47;"Also, it could be that we're old and we're like..."
01:03:47;01:03:49;"Yeah, this doesn't sound the same."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"We haven't heard this song in like 25 years."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"No, that's no."
01:03:53;01:03:55;"That would be a real Matrix moment."
01:03:55;01:03:57;"I hope not."
01:03:57;01:03:58;"That would be weird."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"Seinfeld what?"
01:03:59;01:04:00;"Seinfeld."
01:04:00;01:04:01;"What are you saying, Seinfeld?"
01:04:01;01:04:02;"The real one is now playing."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"What is this, Matt?"
01:04:03;01:04:05;"I can't hear it."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"Oh, that's really Matrixy."
01:04:07;01:04:08;"I can't hear anything."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"Oh, wait a second because I'm an idiot."
01:04:10;01:04:11;"I'm playing it on my own YouTube."
01:04:11;01:04:12;"That's what's going on."
01:04:12;01:04:13;"I'm sorry."
01:04:13;01:04:14;"I thought that was Matt."
01:04:14;01:04:16;"Oh, you guys can't hear it in my own head?"
01:04:16;01:04:18;"Can you confirm or disconfirm?"
01:04:18;01:04:20;"Seinfeld, what year were you born?"
01:04:20;01:04:21;"'82."
01:04:21;01:04:22;"I'm a Silverback."
01:04:22;01:04:25;"Oh, so you're a true Silverback millennial."
01:04:25;01:04:26;"Yeah."
01:04:26;01:04:31;"Seinfeld, can you confirm or disconfirm that it is a different version?"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"Oh, yeah."
01:04:33;01:04:34;"It's faster."
01:04:34;01:04:35;"The beat goes..."
01:04:35;01:04:36;"Not..."
01:04:36;01:04:37;"Right."
01:04:37;01:04:38;"You know, whatever."
01:04:38;01:04:39;"Yeah."
01:04:39;01:04:40;"Okay."
01:04:40;01:04:41;"Oh, yeah."
01:04:41;01:04:42;"It uses that famous sample."
01:04:42;01:04:43;"Is it that one?"
01:04:43;01:04:44;"Oh, yeah."
01:04:44;01:04:45;"Oh, it's not."
01:04:45;01:04:46;"That's something else."
01:04:46;01:04:47;"I know what you're thinking of."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"It's not that."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"Oh, it's not that?"
01:04:49;01:04:50;"The one that's used for ""Real Love"", Mary J. Blige."
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Yeah."
01:04:51;01:04:52;"No."
01:04:52;01:04:55;"Well, Gen X Top 5 is off to a chaotic start."
01:04:55;01:04:59;"I'm sorry to report that we sold out in the first song."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"Who knows?"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"Maybe there's a sample issue."
01:05:02;01:05:06;"That is something that Gen X has in common with now, which is that there are..."
01:05:06;01:05:09;"Like, the album version isn't always like the lit version."
01:05:09;01:05:10;"Sorry that I just used ""lit."""
01:05:10;01:05:13;"But, like, you know, I remember thinking..."
01:05:13;01:05:15;"You're using Silverback millennial terminology."
01:05:15;01:05:20;"You need to either use modern parlance or a Gen X word."
01:05:20;01:05:21;"Yeah."
01:05:21;01:05:24;"What was the lit of Gen X for the Gen X hip-hop fan?"
01:05:24;01:05:25;"Depends."
01:05:25;01:05:26;"Oh, for hip-hop?"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"Dope?"
01:05:27;01:05:28;"Fat."
01:05:28;01:05:29;"It wasn't the dope version."
01:05:29;01:05:30;"Fat."
01:05:33;01:05:34;"With a PH."
01:05:34;01:05:35;"That's a little before..."
01:05:35;01:05:39;"Like, if that's like late 80s, I feel like late 80s into early 90s is fat."
01:05:39;01:05:40;"PH, AT."
01:05:40;01:05:41;"How about tight?"
01:05:41;01:05:42;"Or is that more general usage?"
01:05:42;01:05:43;"Oh, you know what?"
01:05:43;01:05:46;"Actually, I use tight on the Chappelle Show."
01:05:46;01:05:47;"So that's..."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"And that's..."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"That feels..."
01:05:49;01:05:50;"That's like early 2000s."
01:05:50;01:05:51;"Tizzite."
01:05:51;01:05:52;"Tizzite I used."
01:05:52;01:05:53;"So maybe that's..."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"In that post-Snoop Dogg era."
01:05:55;01:05:58;"Well, we know Chappelle is a big fan of 90s hip-hop and R&B."
01:05:58;01:06:02;"Okay, let's get into the number five song from the rock chart."
01:06:04;01:06:05;"Ooh, BJ."
01:06:05;01:06:06;"Jeremy."
01:06:09;01:06:11;"Would you have recognized it immediately, Rashida?"
01:06:11;01:06:12;"BJ?"
01:06:13;01:06:14;"PJ."
01:06:16;01:06:17;"Oh, Jeremy's..."
01:06:17;01:06:18;"Yeah."
01:06:18;01:06:19;"No, I wouldn't have."
01:06:19;01:06:20;"No."
01:06:20;01:06:21;"Would you have known it by now?"
01:06:25;01:06:26;"Yes."
01:06:26;01:06:29;"I would be like Pearl Jam."
01:06:29;01:06:32;"And then it probably would take me to the chorus to really..."
01:06:32;01:06:33;"Right."
01:06:33;01:06:34;"[Laughter]"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"Do you know like all the lyrics to this, Jake?"
01:06:36;01:06:37;"Is it that deep for you?"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"Yeah, it's pretty deep."
01:06:39;01:06:40;"Okay."
01:06:40;01:06:43;"I love this record back in '92."
01:06:54;01:06:57;"I remember the video played all the time on it."
01:06:57;01:06:58;"Oh, yeah."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"Oh, wow."
01:07:00;01:07:04;"Jeremy is based on the story of Jeremy Dell, a 15-year-old sophomore who killed himself"
01:07:04;01:07:10;"in front of his English class at Richardson High School in Richardson, Texas."
01:07:10;01:07:11;"Wow."
01:07:11;01:07:12;"Did he shoot himself?"
01:07:12;01:07:13;"He killed himself."
01:07:13;01:07:14;"He didn't kill his classmates."
01:07:14;01:07:15;"Right."
01:07:15;01:07:19;"But the video was edited in a way that made it unclear what happened."
01:07:19;01:07:23;"Actually, I read a chapter from something a friend of the show, Stephen Heiden, is working"
01:07:23;01:07:24;"on about Pearl Jam."
01:07:24;01:07:26;"It's an excellent Jeremy chapter."
01:07:26;01:07:31;"I actually don't want to blow the spot because I know quite a bit more now about Jeremy in"
01:07:31;01:07:33;"the video having read it."
01:07:33;01:07:35;"People can wait to read his book."
01:07:35;01:07:37;"Cool low-key promo."
01:07:47;01:08:15;"I guess to the Gen Xers on the panel, I just want to ask, because actually I don't know"
01:08:15;01:08:18;"if I fully have the answer for either one of you."
01:08:18;01:08:20;"What's your relationship to Pearl Jam?"
01:08:20;01:08:23;"Jake, I'll start with you because you're the rock guy."
01:08:23;01:08:30;"Every TC head knows that Jake loves Pavement, you're a big Nirvana fan, GBV."
01:08:30;01:08:34;"Where did you fall on Pearl Jam in 1992?"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"Was way in in '92."
01:08:36;01:08:41;"Loved the first three records, Tanned, Versus, and Vitology, and then dropped off."
01:08:41;01:08:44;"Okay, but you still ride for early PJ."
01:08:44;01:08:47;"I don't think I ride for it, but I don't like Jeremy."
01:08:47;01:08:49;"Jeremy's not good."
01:08:49;01:08:51;"Jeremy's bad."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"It doesn't sound good to me."
01:08:53;01:08:55;"Not a fan of Jeremy."
01:08:55;01:08:56;"Not a fan of Alive."
01:08:56;01:08:58;"I've heard Alive too many times."
01:08:58;01:09:00;"The stuff on the first even flows terrible."
01:09:00;01:09:02;"Well, you're just saying it's, well, what do you mean that it's bad?"
01:09:02;01:09:03;"It's played out?"
01:09:03;01:09:04;"Let's just stick with Jeremy."
01:09:04;01:09:07;"I don't think it's like, it's not a fun listen."
01:09:07;01:09:09;"I don't like the melodies."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"I don't like the tones."
01:09:11;01:09:14;"It's very verrat for me."
01:09:14;01:09:17;"With all due respect, Jake, a 15-year-old killing themselves in front of his English class."
01:09:17;01:09:22;"I'm sorry, it's not exactly light fare that Eddie and the boys were tackling here."
01:09:22;01:09:27;"So, yeah, I'm sorry if it didn't make you want to dance or whatever, but I don't think that was their intention."
01:09:27;01:09:29;"Rock out."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"I could have rocked out."
01:09:30;01:09:37;"I mean, like, yeah, maybe they're going for like a Pink Floyd kind of thing or something, where it's just like heavy and despairing."
01:09:37;01:09:39;"It's just, I'm just not a fan of Jeremy."
01:09:39;01:09:50;"Let's see, my favorite Pearl Jam songs are probably like elderly woman behind the counter in a small town, dissident, corduroy, stuff that's a little later."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"How about you, Rashida?"
01:09:51;01:09:52;"Pearl Jam."
01:09:52;01:09:53;"Yeah, all those."
01:09:53;01:09:54;"No, I'm just kidding."
01:09:54;01:09:58;"I truly have no, I know nothing except for Jeremy and Alive."
01:09:58;01:09:59;"That's it."
01:09:59;01:10:00;"Really?"
01:10:00;01:10:01;"You don't know?"
01:10:01;01:10:02;"Wow."
01:10:02;01:10:03;"How about Daughter?"
01:10:03;01:10:04;"Don't call me daughter."
01:10:05;01:10:06;"What about Better Man?"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Oh, yeah, you're right."
01:10:08;01:10:09;"I do."
01:10:09;01:10:20;"I know four songs, but I remember that like the cool girls in my high school class sang Alive at like our senior retreat, like acoustic guitar."
01:10:20;01:10:22;"Wait, like on stage?"
01:10:22;01:10:28;"Like we had like a, you know, like a talent show at the end of like senior retreat, like a going away."
01:10:28;01:10:29;"Yeah."
01:10:29;01:10:33;"So it was just a bunch of your classmates just up on stage going."
01:10:33;01:10:38;"Just like two girls and like one dude on the guitar."
01:10:38;01:10:43;"I don't care if you're like the best singers on earth, multiple people singing Alive."
01:10:43;01:10:48;"Oh, oh, oh."
01:10:48;01:10:51;"Wait, was someone doing the riff too?"
01:10:51;01:10:55;"Was someone doing like the like lead guitar part?"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"I don't know, Jake."
01:10:57;01:11:02;"I mean, I need to know."
01:11:02;01:11:04;"Very hazy memory."
01:11:04;01:11:08;"This is, we're going on, you know, 30 years here."
01:11:08;01:11:13;"Also, the verses of that song are also like pretty dark."
01:11:13;01:11:17;"It's like a funny song to picture like two teen girls singing because it's just about like."
01:11:17;01:11:19;"Yeah, and like popular girls."
01:11:19;01:11:22;"I don't think they were really like feeling the essence of the song, to be honest."
01:11:22;01:11:25;"I think they were showing off their nice voices, you know."
01:11:25;01:11:27;"And they love that chorus."
01:11:27;01:11:30;"It's a good, yeah, I think everybody joined in."
01:11:30;01:11:31;"Is she alive?"
01:11:31;01:11:35;"She said, well, I supposed to be."
01:11:35;01:11:36;"You like that song."
01:11:36;01:11:40;"I used to like that song and it just has not stayed with me over the years."
01:11:40;01:11:41;"Let's put it that way."
01:11:41;01:11:49;"Wait, Rashida, did you, I know I see a similar question last time, but I imagine you never owned a Pearl Jam CD back then."
01:11:49;01:11:57;"No, really, the only thing even close to that for me was REM because I got a free CD."
01:11:57;01:11:58;"Oh, right."
01:11:58;01:11:59;"OK, yeah, I think."
01:11:59;01:12:07;"Are you aware that there in some circles in the early 90s, there was kind of like a line in the sand drawn between Nirvana and Pearl Jam?"
01:12:07;01:12:11;"It kind of was all the same bucket for me."
01:12:11;01:12:14;"So, no, like that was like grunge."
01:12:14;01:12:31;"Again, my only reference point was like singles was probably the closest I got to kind of like, yeah, like Reality Bites and singles were like how I even heard any kind of
music that was like grungy or what else would it be called?"
01:12:31;01:12:36;"Rock 90s, like Gen X-y rock, alternative, Seattle sound."
01:12:36;01:12:40;"But the single soundtrack is like very important for Pearl Jam."
01:12:40;01:12:43;"It has some of their most beloved songs on it."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"Oh, so then I do know their songs."
01:12:44;01:12:45;"What are the other songs that are on there?"
01:12:45;01:12:47;"Oh, you have the single soundtrack?"
01:12:47;01:12:49;"Oh, I was in on that. Yeah."
01:12:49;01:12:52;"Wait, so do you know the Pearl Jam song State of Love and Trust?"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"You got to sing it."
01:12:54;01:12:57;"This is a good state of love and trust."
01:12:57;01:12:59;"Yeah, it's kind of heavy."
01:12:59;01:13:04;"Unless it was like at a pivotal point in the movie that I don't know if I can cosign."
01:13:04;01:13:05;"Well, maybe you listen to it."
01:13:05;01:13:08;"It was a great Smashing Pumpkins song on that soundtrack."
01:13:08;01:13:12;"Wait, but just while we're on the topic of grunge, do you know any Soundgarden songs?"
01:13:12;01:13:15;"Is that Chris Cornell?"
01:13:15;01:13:16;"Yes."
01:13:16;01:13:20;"I like that. What's the one about the Black Hole Sun?"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"Yeah, yeah. Good call."
01:13:22;01:13:24;"Great video. Great video."
01:13:24;01:13:27;"Oh, yeah. Also great video. What about Alice in Chains?"
01:13:27;01:13:31;"I think they also might have had a soundtrack song somewhere."
01:13:31;01:13:33;"What would I know?"
01:13:33;01:13:35;"Man in the Box?"
01:13:35;01:13:38;"I know that name."
01:13:38;01:13:43;"That's like an indie group, right? Indie group. What am I saying? No."
01:13:43;01:13:46;"No, they're classically grunge. They're grunge."
01:13:46;01:13:52;"Okay. Cos I got confused just because the Alice part, like Alice in Chains, Alice Cooper used to confuse me as a kid."
01:13:52;01:13:57;"I know it's different, but I got kind of stuck in that vortex."
01:13:57;01:13:58;"They both rock."
01:13:58;01:13:59;"So, no."
01:13:59;01:14:04;"Alright, let's get back to the R&B chart. The number four song this week, 1992 R&B chart."
01:14:04;01:14:06;"Let's listen."
01:14:07;01:14:11;"Yes. Real love. Mary J. Blige just said this."
01:14:11;01:14:13;"Yeah, we were just talking about the remix."
01:14:13;01:14:14;"The remix."
01:14:14;01:14:19;"So, this song, the original and the remix are both great. Right?"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"Yes, they are. They are."
01:14:21;01:14:31;"And I feel like Mary has that distinction where like all of her remixes and all of her album cuts are equally as good."
01:14:31;01:14:36;"And this album, What's 411, is a classic. I had this on tape."
01:14:36;01:14:56;"This to me sounds like the definitive version that I've heard my whole life."
01:14:56;01:14:59;"You would know the other one. You'd know the other one."
01:14:59;01:15:00;"Really?"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"Yeah, get that remix queued up, Matt."
01:15:02;01:15:04;"Okay, so Jake, you're familiar with this song, though."
01:15:04;01:15:05;"Oh, of course."
01:15:05;01:15:17;"Truly, both versions are excellent."
01:15:17;01:15:20;"So good. Is this a dance hall sample?"
01:15:20;01:15:24;"No, it's like some 60s or 70s R&B soul."
01:15:24;01:15:25;"Oh, yes."
01:15:25;01:15:27;"Is this Do Right Woman or something?"
01:15:27;01:15:29;"Yes, that's what it is."
01:15:29;01:15:39;"But so, Rashida, for a true 90s R&B head, Mary J. Blige, What's the 411, that's like Nirvana, Nevermind for a rock person, right?"
01:15:39;01:15:42;"Just like a giant of an album."
01:15:42;01:15:46;"Yeah, it really is. And I think it's one of those that you just..."
01:15:46;01:15:51;"It was at the time when people listened to albums over and over and over and over and over again."
01:15:51;01:16:00;"So, you know, we didn't have that, like the way that streaming services present songs to you not in their full album form."
01:16:00;01:16:08;"It was just, you did that. You got that one thing, you just wore it out, turn the tape over, wore it out some more, you know."
01:16:08;01:16:13;"What's the 411 like a top five 90s album for you? Like that level?"
01:16:13;01:16:24;"Oh, yeah. Also, to me, it was the first solo, female solo R&B artist, like new solo R&B artist."
01:16:24;01:16:32;"I say that because Janet Jackson had been famous for so long already that like really, I mean, she like grabbed the scene, you know,"
01:16:32;01:16:42;"because she came up from like the whole kind of like Andre Harrell, out of town era, Jodeci, Heavy D, Puffy, all of that."
01:16:42;01:16:48;"She just popped so hard. You remind me, I think was on like a soundtrack, Strictly Business soundtrack, and then she just popped so hard from there."
01:16:48;01:16:50;"But she was, that's why she's the queen."
01:16:50;01:16:56;"And there were so many groups that were really popular now. So she really stood out as a solo artist."
01:16:56;01:16:58;"So this is our first record."
01:16:58;01:17:03;"Yeah, she had a single before this on a soundtrack. This is her first record."
01:17:03;01:17:06;"Ezra, you came to the Mary J. Blige concert with me. Do you remember?"
01:17:06;01:17:13;"Yeah, that's true. We went to, we saw Mary J. at the Hollywood Bowl. That was, the energy was crazy."
01:17:13;01:17:25;"Everybody knows every word of every Mary song, like every guy, every girl, like people were so dialed in, like eyes closed and dialed into like their inner journey."
01:17:25;01:17:27;"It was so great. It was so good."
01:17:27;01:17:29;"Yeah, a lot of emotion."
01:17:29;01:17:31;"Nas was there too, but whatever."
01:17:31;01:17:33;"It was a co-headline tour with Nas. Don't forget him."
01:17:33;01:17:35;"Nas was great too."
01:18:02;01:18:07;"Obviously these things become more apparent in retrospect, but like, it's such a great name for a debut album."
01:18:07;01:18:11;"What's the 411? Just really kicking things off properly."
01:18:11;01:18:15;"Does 411 still exist? Like, is that still a thing you can call?"
01:18:15;01:18:16;"No."
01:18:16;01:18:17;"No more 411."
01:18:17;01:18:19;"Oh, wait, no, I think you can still call it."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"Was 411, was it information?"
01:18:21;01:18:26;"That was like phone service information, right? Or no, no, that was 611."
01:18:26;01:18:32;"Let's get, no, 411 was, so obviously 911 was for emergency."
01:18:32;01:18:35;"911 was for emergency, 411 is for info."
01:18:35;01:18:37;"What kind of info?"
01:18:37;01:18:46;"Like you call and say, hi, looking for a business in Santa Monica, like so-and-so chiropractor, and they would give you the number or they'd connect you."
01:18:46;01:18:48;"So it was like..."
01:18:48;01:18:51;"And it went to AT&T."
01:18:51;01:18:58;"But could you call and just be like, I'm looking for a chiropractor in Santa Monica, and then they would just tell you some?"
01:18:58;01:19:02;"They go through the Yellow Pages, yeah, like their database, Yellow Pages database."
01:19:02;01:19:06;"So if you didn't have the Yellow Pages for some reason."
01:19:06;01:19:08;"That's right, it was directory assistance."
01:19:08;01:19:14;"It was directory, okay, right. So you couldn't just hit them up with like questions?"
01:19:14;01:19:15;"No."
01:19:15;01:19:20;"Because, well, in New York, in New York at some point they had 311, which I think was questions about the city."
01:19:20;01:19:21;"They still have 311."
01:19:21;01:19:25;"Yeah, they still have 311 in New York, and that would be more like, hey, does..."
01:19:25;01:19:30;"You see a pothole, or you see like a street lamp that doesn't work."
01:19:30;01:19:32;"Did you have 611?"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"Yeah, I went to 611."
01:19:34;01:19:38;"611, I think that was like customer service almost, more like..."
01:19:38;01:19:40;"Like city customer service?"
01:19:40;01:19:43;"Like the payphone's broken, or like, oh, I can't..."
01:19:43;01:19:49;"Oh, you could still use that on some of your cell phones, you can call 611 and get somewhere with it."
01:19:49;01:19:50;"Oh, there you go."
01:19:50;01:19:52;"Matt, just kidding."
01:19:52;01:19:54;"[Laughter]"
01:19:54;01:19:57;"A truly different era."
01:19:57;01:19:59;"Do you remember Star 69?"
01:19:59;01:20:00;"Star 82?"
01:20:00;01:20:03;"Wait, Star 69 was calling somebody back?"
01:20:03;01:20:04;"Yeah."
01:20:04;01:20:09;"No, and it wasn't that when you wanted to block your number in case somebody did want to call you back?"
01:20:09;01:20:11;"No, it was a callback."
01:20:11;01:20:15;"No, because if you prank called somebody, there was a thing you could do that would block Star 69."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"Before you called."
01:20:17;01:20:19;"That's Star 67?"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"Yeah, that's right, Star 67."
01:20:21;01:20:24;"Star 82 would unblock you."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"What?"
01:20:25;01:20:26;"Yeah."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"I didn't even know that existed."
01:20:28;01:20:31;"And then there was emergency breakthroughs, but that's a whole other story."
01:20:31;01:20:32;"Remember those?"
01:20:32;01:20:33;"Jake, do you remember those?"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"I don't know any of this stuff."
01:20:35;01:20:37;"This is like the secret menu at In-N-Out or something."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"[Laughter]"
01:20:39;01:20:40;"This exists?"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"That was before call waiting."
01:20:42;01:20:49;"When you were on the phone in the 80s, your friends, you could spend a dollar and call the operator and be like, ""I need to do an emergency breakthrough."""
01:20:49;01:20:52;"And then they'd call and be like, ""You have an emergency breakthrough from Jake."""
01:20:52;01:20:53;"Oh, wow."
01:20:53;01:20:57;"And you could refuse it, which meant you spent a dollar for nothing."
01:20:57;01:20:59;"I don't know that existed."
01:20:59;01:21:03;"I always wondered, why did Star 67 exist?"
01:21:03;01:21:09;"Why would they create something that would make it not possible to like—it seemed like the prank call—"
01:21:09;01:21:10;"Privacy?"
01:21:10;01:21:13;"I guess, but it was such a prank call loophole."
01:21:13;01:21:15;"It's protecting prank calls."
01:21:15;01:21:17;"The First Amendment of the prank caller."
01:21:17;01:21:18;"Right."
01:21:18;01:21:26;"It truly is crazy about how the precursor to computer hackers were freakers."
01:21:26;01:21:33;"And all these dudes like the f***ing Steve Wozniak and all these people, they started out by doing crazy phone hacking."
01:21:33;01:21:38;"Even going back to the 60s, I think back in the day, you could just pick up a phone."
01:21:38;01:21:45;"I've only vaguely understand this, but I think you could buy a little, very simple machine that would play different tones."
01:21:45;01:21:53;"And you could literally pick up your phone, call somebody, and then basically play into the receiver like, ""Kee, brr."""
01:21:53;01:21:56;"And you could like, f***, hack the FBI."
01:21:56;01:22:00;"Landline culture was crazy."
01:22:00;01:22:01;"Crazy?"
01:22:01;01:22:02;"A truly lost era."
01:22:02;01:22:09;"But don't just picture that, f***, like Wozniak and Steve Jobs just picking up going, ""Beep, beep,"" and they were like launching missiles and s***."
01:22:09;01:22:16;"But isn't that sort of like—wasn't that whole thing that Cuban—whatever the Cuban—"
01:22:16;01:22:17;"Missile crisis?"
01:22:17;01:22:19;"Syndrome? No, the Havana syndrome."
01:22:19;01:22:20;"Oh, the new stuff."
01:22:20;01:22:26;"Isn't it like tones and frequencies? It's like wave-based terrorism, right?"
01:22:26;01:22:31;"Where they're just sending out sounds and people are like getting brain damage?"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"I bet a freaker developed it."
01:22:33;01:22:35;"Yeah, I bet they just used dial tones."
01:22:35;01:22:44;"I bet whatever intelligence agency is doing the Havana syndrome, probably they got somebody in the '70s, a freaker, and they were just like,"
01:22:44;01:22:54;"""Son, you got two choices. You can rot in a prison cell for the rest of your life, or you can join our intelligence agency and make your country proud."""
01:22:54;01:23:03;"And he's like, ""All right, I'll do it."" And now this person is in their 60s, and they're just like, ""All right, we need you to take out some American diplomats."""
01:23:03;01:23:08;"And he's like, ""Oh boy, do I have an idea for you. Just need some of my old tools."""
01:23:08;01:23:15;"Yeah, it does seem very Cold War, developing a radio wave or microwave that's going to cook someone's brain from across the street."
01:23:15;01:23:17;"Doesn't that seem so like—"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"Yeah, like the fear of the Cold War."
01:23:19;01:23:20;"1960s."
01:23:20;01:23:29;"Oh, by the way, coming full circle, the word ""freaker,"" I believe, is spelled P-H-R-E-A-K-E-R, so it's kind of like fat or fish."
01:23:29;01:23:30;"That's a nice tie-in."
01:23:30;01:23:37;"If we got any TC heads who are freakers, love to talk to you. Be a little nervous to get you on the phone, though."
01:23:37;01:23:39;"But I have so many questions about freaking."
01:23:39;01:23:43;"The number four song on the rock charts. Let's play it."
01:23:55;01:23:56;"Slow."
01:23:59;01:24:00;"Arrowsmith?"
01:24:00;01:24:01;"No."
01:24:03;01:24:05;"Not a bad guess, but—"
01:24:09;01:24:10;"Morrissey?"
01:24:10;01:24:12;"Yeah, you got to recognize the voice."
01:24:12;01:24:14;"Morrissey with ""Tomorrow."""
01:24:14;01:24:17;"This album, ""Your Arsenal,"" was big in the U.S."
01:24:23;01:24:29;"A little updated vocal effects for him. It's a little too clean for me."
01:24:29;01:24:31;"I've never heard this song in my life."
01:24:42;01:24:46;"Early '90s, solo Morrissey was selling out the Hollywood Bowl."
01:24:46;01:24:51;"Selling out, maybe, just in general. Like a non-Gen X way."
01:24:51;01:25:02;"I never connected with the solo Morrissey stuff, because it just seemed like the band he was playing with was so out of stock, kind of studio guy."
01:25:02;01:25:05;"He's missing Johnny Marr, basically, is what I'm saying."
01:25:05;01:25:10;"I mean, hard to compete with Johnny Marr. But his solo career does have many excellent songs."
01:25:10;01:25:13;"""Everyday"" is like Sunday. One of my faves."
01:25:13;01:25:19;"Just the production of it. There's no real atmosphere or vibe with his—"
01:25:19;01:25:22;"Yeah, he doesn't push it too far outside of his—"
01:25:32;01:25:36;"I like that bass. It was very classic."
01:25:36;01:25:39;"Yeah, very '90s. The Treble-y picked bass."
01:25:39;01:25:45;"And Morrissey also is like—he must be a bit older than Pearl Jam, right?"
01:25:45;01:25:51;"Oh, yeah. Because he was having a career much—first Smith's album's like '83? '84?"
01:25:51;01:25:56;"Yeah, he's probably like—what, in his—like he's probably around 30 here, I'm guessing? I don't know."
01:25:56;01:25:59;"What year was Morrissey born? Seinfeld's ""Good Number Crunch."""
01:26:24;01:26:28;"He was born in 1959. '62."
01:26:28;01:26:33;"Whoa! So he was 33 here?"
01:26:33;01:26:36;"So Morrissey's older than Obama."
01:26:36;01:26:43;"That's crazy. I love Morrissey. I'm from L.A. I feel like it's just like what you do."
01:26:43;01:26:51;"Even when you were at this age, 16, 17, you're in high school, you're listening to Mary J. Blige,"
01:26:51;01:26:58;"""What's the 411?"" over and over again. At that age, were you like aware of Morrissey and the Smiths?"
01:26:58;01:27:05;"Yeah, because they were popular when I was younger and it was so nostalgic. So yeah."
01:27:05;01:27:08;"So they were popular in your high school, the Smiths?"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"No, like grade school."
01:27:10;01:27:12;"Interesting."
01:27:12;01:27:16;"Because wasn't it—weren't they like popping like in the '80s?"
01:27:16;01:27:25;"I don't know if they were popping in America, but they were certainly a major cult band. Yeah, in the mid '80s."
01:27:25;01:27:35;"I feel like music was so much more shrunken that even though I grew up listening to a lot of whatever, R&B and jazz and stuff,"
01:27:35;01:27:42;"like Depeche Mode, Morrissey, New Order, those were all bands that were cool, you know,"
01:27:42;01:27:48;"and had like one or two hits that would be on the radio, on the bus."
01:27:48;01:27:57;"And there is something about the Smiths and Depeche Mode. Famously, the Smiths and Morrissey have this huge fan base in LA,"
01:27:57;01:28:02;"but so does Depeche Mode. Both of those bands weirdly I associate so much with."
01:28:02;01:28:08;"I mean, LA has a—LA, of all American cities, loves gothy, depressing English music."
01:28:08;01:28:13;"The Cure, too. At their height, The Cure sold out Dodger Stadium like multiple times."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"That's amazing."
01:28:15;01:28:17;"LA's depressing."
01:28:17;01:28:27;"I was going to say something about the gloomy, gothy English music is like the opposite of the sunny, sun-bleached LA vibe."
01:28:27;01:28:30;"It's also the subtext of that, you know?"
01:28:30;01:28:31;"Yes."
01:28:31;01:28:32;"It's really going on."
01:28:32;01:28:33;"Yin and yang."
01:28:33;01:28:42;"You know, it's funny. I saw people wearing Smiths shirts, like cool kids wearing Smiths shirts for years before I ever heard a note from the Smiths."
01:28:42;01:28:46;"I don't think I really even heard them until I was like out of college."
01:28:46;01:28:47;"Oh, really?"
01:28:47;01:28:52;"I don't—yeah, just for some reason when I was a kid, I was like, I didn't like '80s music."
01:28:52;01:28:56;"By the time, like, as the '90s progressed, I was like, I hate '80s music."
01:28:56;01:29:00;"I like like '60s and '70s music and '90s music."
01:29:00;01:29:07;"It took me a long time to finally go back into that like '80s, you know, replacements, Smiths, like all those kind of bands."
01:29:07;01:29:12;"Anyway, they weren't on MTV and they weren't on the radio, so I didn't hear them."
01:29:12;01:29:17;"Yeah, you probably needed just like no, like a head to get you in, at least in Connecticut."
01:29:17;01:29:22;"This is the number three song on the R&B charts this week in '92."
01:29:22;01:29:25;"I'm not familiar with it based on the name."
01:29:29;01:29:30;"You got to take off, Seinfeld."
01:29:30;01:29:31;"Bye, guys."
01:29:31;01:29:32;"All right."
01:29:32;01:29:33;"Peace."
01:29:33;01:29:34;"Classic drum fill there."
01:29:34;01:29:35;"It's a group."
01:29:35;01:29:36;"I've never—"
01:29:36;01:29:37;"I need to wear this if I got something."
01:29:37;01:29:38;"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it."
01:29:46;01:30:07;"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it."
01:30:07;01:30:30;"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it."
01:30:30;01:30:59;"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it."
01:30:59;01:31:06;"It's also the first song is a slow jam. It's very romantic like it's not sexy"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"like it's just romantic."
01:31:16;01:31:21;"Alright let's keep it moving. It is funny there's something about these 92 rock ones."
01:31:21;01:31:25;"They're a little random. Next time we do this let's move to 93 and see what"
01:31:25;01:31:28;"happens. I don't think anybody's gonna call this one but let's let's throw it"
01:31:28;01:31:34;"on. This is the number three song on the Billboard modern rock tracks this week"
01:31:34;01:31:35;"in 92."
01:32:04;01:32:09;"Ezra, band or solo artists? Solo artists and I don't associate them with rock"
01:32:09;01:32:10;"per se."
01:32:16;01:32:22;"Male or female? Female. A cool artist. I love a lot of this artist's work but"
01:32:27;01:32:32;"Is it like Susanne Vega or something? Yes yes it's Susanne Vega. Really? Wow."
01:32:32;01:32:37;"It's called Blood Makes Noise. This is on the chart only because she had like two"
01:32:37;01:32:41;"or three probably very good singles before this so anything she was going to"
01:32:41;01:32:45;"release next would be paid attention to right? Yes. Yeah or at least got played on"
01:32:45;01:32:49;"the radio. I don't even know if this chart was a sales chart. It might have"
01:32:49;01:32:54;"been a radio chart. What was the height of Susanne Vega's career like 89? Luca."
01:32:54;01:33:01;"Well it's funny it was around this time because she had Luca was a big song in"
01:33:01;01:33:07;"the 80s and then she had Tom's Diner but you know Tom's Diner was a acapella song"
01:33:07;01:33:10;"on the same album as Luca and it wasn't until the early 90s that there was the"
01:33:10;01:33:17;"DNA remix, the sellout version. The truly famous version of Tom's Diner was the"
01:33:17;01:33:22;"remix. It was years later. The original Tom's Diner came out in the 80s and this"
01:33:22;01:33:24;"one came out in the 90s. Let's listen to that remix."
01:33:41;01:33:46;"This and also Everything But The Girl, two songs where the remix was like so"
01:33:46;01:33:50;"much bigger. What year is this remix? Yeah what year is this remix? I don't"
01:33:50;01:33:55;"know but isn't that the exact same breakbeat as Soul to Soul? Keep on"
01:33:55;01:34:03;"moving. Could be yeah. It could be the same sample. 1990. Okay. Okay so this is"
01:34:03;01:34:10;"1990 actually. All right. This is an unlikely hit. Yeah. Right? Yeah. As a non-"
01:34:10;01:34:16;"Vega head this strikes me as the height of Vega's career which makes sense then"
01:34:16;01:34:20;"in 92. This is 90. I don't even know that song. What is Luca? Really? Throw in"
01:34:20;01:34:25;"Luca. I'm sure I'll know it when I hear it. We have to also note that once we"
01:34:25;01:34:30;"recorded A Time Crisis at Tom's Diner which the song is about."
01:34:35;01:34:36;"This sounds cool."
01:34:43;01:34:46;"It's not placing it though. You'll know."
01:34:48;01:34:49;"Long intro man."
01:34:55;01:34:56;"What year is this?"
01:34:56;01:34:59;"87. Wow."
01:34:59;01:35:06;"This is like very influential. Obviously this really set the stage for a type of"
01:35:06;01:35:12;"90s folk alternative. It reminds me of the Rembrandts. Yeah and at least Hello. I"
01:35:12;01:35:18;"mean there's none of that without those. Right. Yeah very lobe. I don't actually"
01:35:18;01:35:19;"know this song. Really?"
01:35:29;01:35:36;"I feel like this also reminds me of the beginning of VH1. Oh totally. Oh yeah. VH1"
01:35:36;01:35:39;"was like. She's a pillar of early VH1. A little more. This might have had like some"
01:35:39;01:35:44;"sort of like stop motion video or something. Like what was the video for this? Or maybe"
01:35:44;01:35:49;"it's just her looking out a window. I can't picture it. I'm not mad at this Vega. Oh no."
01:35:49;01:35:53;"80s. There's 80s Vega. Excellent. All right let's keep moving. The number two song on"
01:35:53;01:35:56;"R&B charts. I don't know this artist."
01:36:01;01:36:01;"Oh."
01:36:08;01:36:10;"Yes."
01:36:17;01:36:20;"Oh it's playing hard to get."
01:36:28;01:36:29;"Uh is it High Five?"
01:36:29;01:36:36;"Yes. High Five with She's Playing Hard to Get. Jake you know High Five? No."
01:36:37;01:36:43;"You might know. Me neither. Their biggest hit is the kissing game. They were like little"
01:36:43;01:36:50;"boys. Little kids. I love this. It sounds great. Some great organ playing."
01:36:50;01:36:59;"So is this kid like 15 or something singing? Yeah you know what's really sad is this kid"
01:36:59;01:37:07;"died from a freon. Like a freon accident. His fridge leaked. And he. Oh my god."
01:37:07;01:37:14;"Or what? No he just inhaled it in his house. Really? But no. Because that's like super toxic."
01:37:14;01:37:21;"Yeah really toxic. You can die from that? Jesus. Yeah. Everybody get your refrigerator looked at."
01:37:21;01:37:27;"That's the lesson here. For real. Yikes. But it's funny because all these songs,"
01:37:27;01:37:32;"these R&B songs, they're all like second or third singles from When It Wonders kind of you know."
01:37:33;01:37:38;"This is a bigger song. Right. You know. You find that a lot on the charts. It's like you get"
01:37:38;01:37:42;"just that week you get a kind of random later single from an artist."
01:37:52;01:38:00;"I mean this this era of the R&B charts. Great palette. Great palette. Yeah. Just a good time."
01:38:00;01:38:06;"Better than the rock palette. I'm gonna say it. Oh good. See I feel like I'm winning right now."
01:38:06;01:38:13;"You are winning. I mean the rock palette in 92 so far has been rough. We got Jeremy. We got"
01:38:13;01:38:19;"sort of third tier Morrissey. And we got fourth tier Vega. Oh and it's. And the palette. The"
01:38:19;01:38:24;"palette specifically. It's you know what Jake I'm sad to say it's only getting more random."
01:38:24;01:38:28;"Oh here we go. Let's go. Let's get into the number two song on the rock charts."
01:38:31;01:38:34;"Again this is 92. Transitional year."
01:38:44;01:38:49;"I'm sensing this is another artist that was big in the 80s that has a late career album."
01:38:49;01:38:51;"Yes. Excellent call."
01:38:56;01:39:03;"Oh is it George? No it's not George Michael. It's um. Oh it's In Excess. Is it Michael Hutchinson?"
01:39:03;01:39:06;"Yes. In Excess. Do you know this song? I don't know if I know the song. Maybe."
01:39:06;01:39:10;"I think I do. I think the chorus is going to tell us things."
01:39:27;01:39:29;"Oh yeah I want to be inside you."
01:39:29;01:39:35;"That's what he says. I want to be inside you."
01:39:38;01:39:42;"Up in octaves. This could totally be a U2 song from the same era."
01:39:42;01:39:47;"Oh this is totally Octoon Baby drum sound. Yeah. Zuropa."
01:39:47;01:39:51;"I think Octoon Baby was 92. It's no secret."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"Yeah. No Octoon Baby's 91. Is it?"
01:39:53;01:39:56;"What's the song called? Not Enough Time."
01:39:56;01:40:00;"That sounds kind of foreshadowing for him. Sorry to be dark but."
01:40:00;01:40:03;"Oh yeah because he died four or five years later."
01:40:03;01:40:06;"Yeah. I hate that chorus. I want to be inside you."
01:40:08;01:40:11;"Not down. Not enough poetry for you Jake?"
01:40:11;01:40:12;"Just get to the facts."
01:40:16;01:40:19;"I kind of like that little synth part. It's kind of cool."
01:40:19;01:40:20;"Yeah."
01:40:36;01:40:37;"Yeah I like the production."
01:40:37;01:40:39;"It's not their best. It's not their best."
01:40:39;01:40:42;"No now I just hear now I just hear Octoon Baby."
01:40:42;01:40:44;"What's the U2 song that goes like."
01:40:44;01:40:46;"Yeah I know you're talking about like. It's no secret."
01:40:46;01:40:48;"It's no secret."
01:40:48;01:40:51;"I can't think."
01:40:51;01:40:53;"Oh The Fly. Play The Fly by U2."
01:40:53;01:40:54;"Oh The Fly is sick."
01:40:54;01:40:59;"The Fly has that really good like falsetto chorus."
01:40:59;01:41:01;"Yeah."
01:41:01;01:41:03;"The Fly is like fast too as I remember."
01:41:06;01:41:07;"I think it's track one on Octoon."
01:41:07;01:41:08;"No it's not track one."
01:41:11;01:41:11;"No."
01:41:21;01:41:23;"This is pretty bold. When you really think about like"
01:41:23;01:41:27;"this U2 coming back with the sound just like."
01:41:27;01:41:31;"That guitar still sounds pretty. Oh you're right. The Fly is track six."
01:41:31;01:41:32;"Oh wait no."
01:41:32;01:41:33;"No that sounds right."
01:41:33;01:41:35;"What am I looking at? Track seven."
01:41:48;01:41:52;"Something about like are those drums sampled in the NXS and the U2?"
01:41:52;01:41:55;"It has like the same kind of sound."
01:41:55;01:41:55;"Yeah."
01:42:01;01:42:05;"The verse of this song is kind of boring and then it goes into that awesome falsetto chorus."
01:42:27;01:42:30;"Yeah I guess Michael Hutchinson and Bono had a lot in common."
01:42:30;01:42:32;"But especially with that low."
01:42:33;01:42:36;"I've never thought of a connection between them but it's totally there."
01:42:38;01:42:41;"It's no secret that I want to be inside of you."
01:42:48;01:42:51;"See U2 would do it a little more subtly. They'd have a song like"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"who's gonna ride your wild horses. Which is like."
01:42:53;01:42:54;"Now that we're broken up."
01:42:54;01:42:54;"Right."
01:43:13;01:43:15;"Well a funny palette."
01:43:15;01:43:17;"Look well you know there's two modes of communication."
01:43:17;01:43:21;"Bono is that kind of you know very poetic romantic."
01:43:21;01:43:22;"Irish."
01:43:22;01:43:23;"Irishman."
01:43:23;01:43:24;"Yeah."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"Michael Hutchinson was you know to the point."
01:43:26;01:43:27;"Australian."
01:43:27;01:43:28;"More of a Trent Reznor."
01:43:32;01:43:35;"Maybe the most infamous chorus of the 90s."
01:43:35;01:43:40;"On a spectrum though it's like either you got to be who's gonna ride your wild horses"
01:43:40;01:43:42;"or you got to say I want to f*** you like an animal."
01:43:44;01:43:45;"I want to be inside of you."
01:43:45;01:43:46;"It's just neither here nor there."
01:43:46;01:43:49;"Splitting the difference and you're ending up nowhere."
01:43:51;01:43:56;"I wonder if a few years after that NXS song he heard Nine Inch Nails closer."
01:43:56;01:43:57;"I want to f*** you like."
01:43:57;01:44:00;"And he's just like f*** damn it I held back."
01:44:00;01:44:02;"I should have just come out swinging."
01:44:30;01:44:35;"You guys ready for the number one song this week on the R&B chart?"
01:44:35;01:44:35;"Hell yeah."
01:44:35;01:44:36;"Yes."
01:44:36;01:44:38;"Let's throw it on."
01:44:47;01:44:48;"Bobby Brown."
01:44:48;01:44:50;"Ain't nobody humping around."
01:44:50;01:44:52;"That's another unsubtle song."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"Humping around."
01:44:54;01:44:56;"Humping is the funniest word."
01:44:56;01:44:57;"Humping is a tough word."
01:44:59;01:45:03;"Like an adult singing humping is very funny because like that's very like middle school like."
01:45:03;01:45:05;"Humping."
01:45:05;01:45:09;"There was also like a humping dance in the video I remember."
01:45:09;01:45:10;"Oh my god."
01:45:10;01:45:13;"Not to be confused with the Humpty dance."
01:45:13;01:45:14;"Oh yeah right."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"Humpty."
01:45:16;01:45:20;"This song really is something for everybody because Jake that part we just heard."
01:45:20;01:45:25;"I guess it says it's an interpolation of Led Zeppelin's dancing."
01:45:25;01:45:26;"Oh yeah."
01:45:31;01:45:35;"So this song appeals to the R&B crowd to the classic rock people."
01:45:35;01:45:36;"This actually has a good verse."
01:45:36;01:45:40;"The verse is really strong on this song and then the chorus gets a little lame."
01:45:40;01:45:44;"But the verse and the kind of B section are good."
01:45:49;01:45:51;"Is this the same era as Every Little Step You Take?"
01:45:51;01:45:52;"After."
01:45:52;01:45:53;"No."
01:45:53;01:45:56;"Because Every Little Step is like 88."
01:45:56;01:45:56;"No."
01:45:56;01:45:57;"Oh is it?"
01:45:57;01:45:58;"Oh wow."
01:45:58;01:45:59;"Maybe 89, 90."
01:45:59;01:46:00;"Oh wow."
01:46:00;01:46:02;"This might even be a different album."
01:46:02;01:46:03;"Is it?"
01:46:03;01:46:04;"I don't know."
01:46:04;01:46:05;"Ezra?"
01:46:05;01:46:06;"Yeah this chorus is."
01:46:06;01:46:10;"I feel you the verses are good and the choruses are."
01:46:10;01:46:12;"What is the actual chorus?"
01:46:12;01:46:16;"Everybody's humping around."
01:46:16;01:46:20;"Are they really quoting Led Zeppelin there or did Led Zeppelin just like."
01:46:20;01:46:21;"I mean it's just like a half step."
01:46:21;01:46:26;"Oh it's interesting like the song was originally titled F***ing Around."
01:46:26;01:46:31;"Okay so someone was like we can't go Reznor we gotta like dial it back."
01:46:39;01:46:42;"So the point of this song it's actually not about humping around it's like"
01:46:42;01:46:46;"when people are like giving you s*** that they they're up in your business and you say"
01:46:46;01:46:49;"leave me alone ain't nobody humping around."
01:46:49;01:46:50;"I think he's."
01:46:50;01:46:51;"Get up off my back."
01:46:51;01:46:52;"Yeah he's saying."
01:46:52;01:46:52;"Save a heart attack."
01:46:52;01:46:54;"Yeah he's saying that to his girl."
01:46:54;01:46:56;"He's like stop accusing me of cheating."
01:46:56;01:46:58;"I'm not humping around."
01:46:58;01:47:00;"Yeah."
01:47:00;01:47:05;"Oh ain't nobody humping around sorry not everybody nobody's doing it sorry."
01:47:05;01:47:06;"Right."
01:47:08;01:47:13;"It's the same so you got that same 90s swing New Jack swing."
01:47:13;01:47:17;"Right one thing about this R&B chart you can still see it's like"
01:47:17;01:47:20;"basically still in the New Jack swing era drum fills."
01:47:45;01:47:48;"Wait Matt would you throw in Dancing Days?"
01:47:55;01:47:57;"There's that Dancing Days."
01:47:57;01:48:00;"Ain't nobody humping around."
01:48:03;01:48:05;"Ain't nobody humping around."
01:48:07;01:48:11;"So it's just that riff isn't that riff just a half step?"
01:48:13;01:48:16;"Yeah I mean it's like considering all that Led Zeppelin stole."
01:48:17;01:48:17;"Right."
01:48:26;01:48:27;"Do you know this song Rashida?"
01:48:27;01:48:33;"Yeah I do and it's really sad because I think I remember first hearing this and thinking"
01:48:33;01:48:35;"oh it sounds like humping around."
01:48:37;01:48:38;"No that's not sad."
01:48:38;01:48:41;"You know it's funny this song when you really think about it"
01:48:41;01:48:45;"I wonder if they were trying to do a Stones song."
01:48:45;01:48:45;"Oh."
01:48:45;01:48:49;"And they were like let's do like a Stones song but make it let's throw in some of our"
01:48:49;01:48:50;"magical Druid."
01:48:50;01:48:51;"Mm-hmm."
01:48:51;01:48:54;"Because that's what it sounds like to me this is like Druid style."
01:48:54;01:48:54;"Totally."
01:49:10;01:49:13;"I always thought Led Zeppelin was interesting that they're like they didn't"
01:49:13;01:49:19;"betray any influence of like the 60s bands like like in terms of like Beatles or Stones."
01:49:19;01:49:19;"Right."
01:49:19;01:49:21;"I mean I do hear some Stones here."
01:49:21;01:49:22;"Yeah yeah."
01:49:22;01:49:26;"But also this is on um Houses of the Holy."
01:49:26;01:49:30;"By this point in their career they were getting into like genre experiments just having fun."
01:49:30;01:49:30;"Yeah."
01:49:31;01:49:33;"But Rashida do you care about Led Zeppelin?"
01:49:33;01:49:34;"Are you a fan?"
01:49:34;01:49:38;"I think they're great yeah I mean I wouldn't say I have like have a deep deep deep knowledge"
01:49:38;01:49:42;"but like I do love anything I've ever hear of theirs."
01:49:42;01:49:46;"What's it I feel like you know a song that I really like of theirs that every time we"
01:49:46;01:49:47;"listen to I'm like I like that song."
01:49:47;01:49:48;"Me?"
01:49:48;01:49:48;"Yeah you."
01:49:48;01:49:52;"I've got kind of like corny Zeppelin taste."
01:49:52;01:49:58;"I like all of it but I like their tropical songs like Dire Maker you know their reggae"
01:49:58;01:50:00;"song you know that song Rashida?"
01:50:00;01:50:01;"I don't think so."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"You know it if you heard it but."
01:50:02;01:50:03;"Okay."
01:50:03;01:50:07;"Throw on Dire Maker and then Fool in the Rain."
01:50:08;01:50:13;"I feel I can't remember if I recommended that Vampire Weekend cover Fool in the Rain"
01:50:13;01:50:16;"but I also think that Stephen Malcomus tweeted."
01:50:16;01:50:17;"Oh right."
01:50:17;01:50:21;"That Vampire Weekend should cover Fool in the Rain and I was like I feel like I've already"
01:50:21;01:50:22;"thought of that."
01:50:22;01:50:27;"That's that classic Malcolm Malcolmist shade although I will say it's not a bad idea and"
01:50:27;01:50:28;"I've always loved that song."
01:50:28;01:50:29;"It's a great idea."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"Oh yeah love this song."
01:50:33;01:50:34;"Yeah."
01:50:34;01:50:39;"This has the guitar solo in this is like epic."
01:50:39;01:50:43;"Yeah like I could see why people think it's corny but once that octave guitar solo comes"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"in they stick the landing."
01:50:50;01:50:51;"So good."
01:50:51;01:50:55;"Obviously all the Led Zeppelin blues rock stuff is just like sick."
01:50:55;01:50:58;"That stuff rolls but then you even get into this stuff and it's sick."
01:50:58;01:51:04;"Yeah I mean I'll give it up for the rock sh*t but I love this and then I love like the"
01:51:04;01:51:05;"I love like No Quarter."
01:51:05;01:51:06;"Oh yeah."
01:51:06;01:51:07;"Quiet Weird Song."
01:51:07;01:51:09;"All of My Love."
01:51:09;01:51:12;"Yeah I mean every Zepp album is way different."
01:52:01;01:52:02;"Throw in Dyer Maker though."
01:52:02;01:52:03;"That's so good."
01:52:04;01:52:09;"I mean really they like the real hardcore blues stuff was really their first two records."
01:52:09;01:52:10;"Yeah."
01:52:10;01:52:12;"You know this song Rachele?"
01:52:12;01:52:12;"Oh yeah."
01:52:12;01:52:14;"Of course."
01:52:31;01:52:32;"Does somebody cover this?"
01:52:32;01:52:33;"I'm sure."
01:52:34;01:52:35;"Yes."
01:52:35;01:52:39;"I can think of like at least just one interpolation or something."
01:52:39;01:52:39;"So good."
01:52:49;01:52:50;"Great song."
01:52:50;01:52:55;"Still sounds so good and it's cool like that's the thing about them they're so cool."
01:52:55;01:53:00;"I know Led Zeppelin's not for everybody although apparently they weren't considered that cool."
01:53:00;01:53:00;"Oh really?"
01:53:01;01:53:06;"Well huge commercial success but critically kind of maligned."
01:53:06;01:53:07;"Yeah huge."
01:53:07;01:53:08;"Interesting."
01:53:08;01:53:10;"It is kind of interesting."
01:53:10;01:53:16;"I don't have a sense really of yeah it's like if there were rock critics that came of age in the 60s"
01:53:16;01:53:23;"I think they thought Zeppelin was like kind of harsh or something I'm not really sure."
01:53:23;01:53:29;"I wonder if like they thought that like Pink Floyd was like a more legit like exploring"
01:53:29;01:53:34;"like weird stuff and Led Zeppelin was kind of like dorky somehow even though they're like"
01:53:34;01:53:39;"objectively like cool like good-looking like dudes."
01:53:39;01:53:46;"It'd be interesting to look up the like the the reviews from the era you know look up"
01:53:46;01:53:52;"the like Robert Criscow reviews from like 1972 or something and see what they had to say."
01:53:52;01:53:55;"It's easy to look back now and say that him singing about like Lord of the Rings was like"
01:53:55;01:54:02;"kind of uncool but back then because you know they have a song where he's where Robert Plant's"
01:54:02;01:54:06;"talking about Gollum and the darkest depths of Mordor."
01:54:06;01:54:10;"Gollum and the evil!"
01:54:10;01:54:10;"Gollum!"
01:54:10;01:54:16;"But I would also say one thing about Led Zeppelin is like whether or not you like them"
01:54:16;01:54:23;"they're almost like Beatles level in terms of kind of every song is like meaningful."
01:54:23;01:54:28;"Like even when you just get into like deeper songs on physical graffiti House of the Holy"
01:54:28;01:54:33;"like they're all I mean House of the Holy back to front every song is like different."
01:54:33;01:54:37;"Every song is different and like yeah I don't even know how to put it because I know it'd"
01:54:37;01:54:42;"be too much to say like you can't say every Beatles song is good but it's like you know"
01:54:42;01:54:48;"even if you don't like lovely Rita meter maid it's still like you know it has a place in"
01:54:48;01:54:49;"the catalog and it's well crafted."
01:54:50;01:54:55;"Zeppelin is kind of like that like every song is like I don't know it serves a purpose."
01:54:55;01:54:59;"Well it helps maybe too because all their all their albums are like eight songs so it's"
01:54:59;01:55:06;"like you're releasing eight songs every year for a bunch of consecutive years so it's sort"
01:55:06;01:55:09;"of like it's not an overwhelming number to get through."
01:55:09;01:55:12;"Right physical graffiti yeah double album but it's gifted."
01:55:12;01:55:15;"All right we gotta wrap this up."
01:55:15;01:55:19;"We just went down to Zeppelin, I'm happy to do it."
01:55:19;01:55:23;"I'm pretty sure I mean I'm giving it away but I'm pretty sure this was the number one"
01:55:23;01:55:27;"song on the on the rock list last time do you remember?"
01:55:27;01:55:28;"Throw it on."
01:55:28;01:55:38;"Oh I remember this good song Peter Gabriel."
01:55:38;01:55:42;"Oh yeah you can definitely see how this song paved the way for like this is like kind of"
01:55:42;01:55:49;"like beer commercial now or like whiskey commercial just like or even like a truck or some just"
01:55:49;01:55:53;"like also kind of prestige tv opening credits vibe."
01:55:53;01:55:59;"Oh my god you're totally right like a very expensive animation sequence of like textures."
01:55:59;01:56:02;"Like water and like clocks inner clocks work."
01:56:02;01:56:05;"Gears turning."
01:56:05;01:56:06;"Yeah."
01:56:09;01:56:12;"Summer to winter like time lapse."
01:56:12;01:56:15;"Exactly clouds moving leaves falling off trees."
01:56:15;01:56:27;"Again another Octoon Baby contemporary."
01:56:27;01:56:31;"We should make a period piece that takes place in 1992."
01:56:31;01:56:36;"It's two LAPD detectives forced to work together."
01:56:37;01:56:43;"One loves the virgin and grunge scene the other one's super into R&B and they uncover"
01:56:43;01:56:47;"a massive supernatural."
01:56:47;01:56:52;"I like this song though maybe just because I've heard it twice now on this show but I like it."
01:56:52;01:56:57;"Yeah it's not a bad song and that's the name of the series it's called Digging in the Dirt."
01:56:57;01:57:00;"Coming to Showtime 2022."
01:57:01;01:57:02;"This is for real."
01:57:02;01:57:26;"So this was a hit."
01:57:26;01:57:27;"This song evolved."
01:57:27;01:57:30;"This was a number one for three months at least."
01:57:30;01:57:33;"I guess this song was tearing up the -"
01:57:33;01:57:34;"That's wild!"
01:57:34;01:57:35;"Rock radio then."
01:57:35;01:57:40;"This song evolved out of a project where Gabriel studied inmates on death row to find out what"
01:57:40;01:57:41;"made them kill."
01:57:41;01:57:43;"Whoa!"
01:57:43;01:57:43;"Wait, what?"
01:57:43;01:57:48;"He would go talk to inmates who were convicted of murder?"
01:57:48;01:57:50;"Well, he read a book about it I think."
01:57:50;01:57:53;"Cool."
01:57:53;01:57:59;"Wait, what's that David Fincher show about the FBI agents who study -"
01:57:59;01:58:02;"I don't know if they still make that show but it'd be like,"
01:58:02;01:58:06;"""Can we reboot Mindhunter and make it Mindhunter 92?"""
01:58:06;01:58:14;"And it just like fully skipped the 80s and it's about the FBI mind hunters in the 90s"
01:58:14;01:58:15;"digging in the dirt."
01:58:15;01:58:18;"It's yeah, it's Mindhunter colon digging in the dirt."
01:58:18;01:58:21;"It's me and Rashida co-starring."
01:58:21;01:58:25;"I'm the guy into the burgeoning grunge scene."
01:58:25;01:58:25;"Exactly."
01:58:25;01:58:27;"It's gonna be great."
01:58:27;01:58:28;"We're gonna be driving around in a cruiser."
01:58:28;01:58:30;"A lot of cool car banter."
01:58:30;01:58:35;"I'm with it."
01:58:35;01:58:36;"I'm free."
01:58:36;01:58:39;"But have you heard the first Alice in Chains record?"
01:58:39;01:58:42;"Jake, where the hell were you?"
01:58:42;01:58:44;"I got ambushed by the gangsters."
01:58:44;01:58:47;"I was at a Candlebox concert."
01:58:47;01:58:49;"This is not gonna fly."
01:58:49;01:58:51;"My pager was off."
01:58:51;01:58:52;"I couldn't hear it."
01:58:52;01:58:56;"You should have emergency breakthroughed me."
01:58:56;01:58:58;"That's true."
01:58:58;01:59:01;"Oh yeah, that's definitely an episode."
01:59:01;01:59:05;"Episode 107, Emergency Breakthrough."
01:59:05;01:59:08;"Written by Seinfeld 2000."
01:59:08;01:59:11;"Ezra, really quick."
01:59:11;01:59:13;"Steam was the number one song when we did it last time,"
01:59:13;01:59:16;"but we played Digging in the Dirt because we thought it was a better song."
01:59:16;01:59:18;"So we played Steam and then went Digging in the Dirt."
01:59:18;01:59:19;"Oh, okay."
01:59:19;01:59:20;"Oh."
01:59:20;01:59:22;"Okay, that's a great note."
01:59:22;01:59:24;"Okay, so Peter Gabriel just tearing up the charts."
01:59:24;01:59:27;"We listened to Steam and then we listened to Digging in the Dirt because Jake remembered it."
01:59:27;01:59:28;"Right."
01:59:28;01:59:31;"All right, well, another great Gen X Top 5."
01:59:31;01:59:37;"Thank you, as always, to co-host Jake Longstreth and our very special guest, Rashida Jones."
01:59:37;01:59:37;"Thank you."
01:59:37;01:59:38;"It was so fun."
01:59:38;01:59:39;"I'm down to do this."
01:59:39;01:59:40;"Let's do 93 next time."
01:59:40;01:59:42;"Let's just ramp it up."
01:59:42;01:59:43;"Okay, and let's make it sooner."
01:59:43;01:59:45;"Let's do 93 in December, right?"
01:59:45;01:59:46;"Yeah, yeah."
01:59:46;01:59:47;"Great."
01:59:47;01:59:49;"Yeah, sometime next month."
01:59:49;01:59:50;"For whenever."

01:59:50;01:59:51;"Next week."
01:59:51;01:59:51;"I don't care."
