00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, Oscars wrap up."
00:05;00:07;"We'll talk about that a little bit."
00:07;00:12;"We'll also talk about the controversial children's film, Peter Rabbit."
00:12;00:18;"We'll also dig back into our favorite Diet Coke commercial, but this time with a twist."
00:18;00:26;"All this, plus listener emails and the top 10 songs on iTunes right now."
00:26;00:31;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:31;00:36;"Beats 1."
00:36;00:56;"Time Crisis."
01:18;01:20;"Time Crisis back at it again."
01:20;01:22;"It's showtime."
01:22;01:29;"In classic Time Crisis fashion, because we're every two weeks, it means that we got a lot of news to cover."
01:29;01:37;"It's not always the freshest news, but we reheat it here for our listeners because we're their primary news source."
01:37;01:40;"Last Sunday was the Oscars."
01:40;01:41;"Did you go?"
01:41;01:43;"I didn't go to the Oscars."
01:43;01:46;"I feel like if there was an award show, there's like a 30% chance you went."
01:46;01:47;"That I went?"
01:47;01:48;"Yeah."
01:48;01:52;"There's actually a party and a viewing event/party for it."
01:52;01:53;"Vanity Fair party?"
01:53;01:54;"Exactly."
01:54;01:55;"Nice."
01:55;01:59;"Yeah, they have this little dinner and you watch and hang out."
01:59;02:01;"There's a massive party."
02:01;02:02;"Right."
02:02;02:03;"It's a famous thing."
02:03;02:04;"People are covering it."
02:04;02:05;"It's a major Hollywood event."
02:05;02:07;"I didn't know about it until recently."
02:07;02:09;"I was like, ""Where's my invite?"""
02:09;02:11;"Maybe I'll try to get you in next year."
02:11;02:12;"I'm already-"
02:12;02:13;"To see coverage."
02:13;02:14;"I'm already just a plus one."
02:14;02:16;"Maybe I can get a plus one, plus one."
02:16;02:17;"Actually, you know what?"
02:17;02:20;"I saw when the big party started, I saw a lot of the Apple crew."
02:20;02:22;"I saw Zane was in the building."
02:22;02:25;"Apple's got a connection to it, so they should be inviting more personalities."
02:25;02:26;"Right, man."
02:26;02:28;"I saw Charli XCX there."
02:28;02:33;"You're just as much a beats one radio personality as she is."
02:33;02:34;"I saw Haim there."
02:34;02:36;"Now I'm feeling kind of bad about myself."
02:36;02:37;"We're going to get you in."
02:37;02:38;"Why wasn't I there?"
02:38;02:40;"Why didn't I get that invite?"
02:43;02:47;"#JaketVanityAffair2019."
02:47;03:05;"But anyway, so yeah, I watched the Oscars at this event."
03:05;03:07;"Did you watch them at home?"
03:07;03:09;"Yeah, I kind of dipped in and out."
03:09;03:10;"Yeah?"
03:10;03:11;"You get some goldfish in a bowl?"
03:11;03:12;"I didn't do that."
03:12;03:14;"Did you have people over?"
03:14;03:16;"I was rolling solo."
03:16;03:17;"Oh."
03:17;03:21;"Hannah was out of town, and I put out a few feelers to people, like, ""Hey, are you watching?"""
03:21;03:22;"Because I don't have cable."
03:22;03:24;"You need cable to watch the Oscars?"
03:24;03:25;"Or a digital antenna."
03:25;03:28;"I did a little research to try to suss this out."
03:28;03:34;"This is pathetic, but I ended up opening a Hulu live account, because you get a free one-week trial."
03:34;03:35;"Yeah."
03:35;03:40;"So I streamed it live and then immediately canceled the account the second the Oscars were over."
03:40;03:41;"Okay, nice."
03:41;03:43;"I was double-screening it."
03:43;03:51;"I was watching on my laptop, and I was actually working on some art-related stuff on that same laptop with multiple windows."
03:51;03:52;"Okay."
03:52;03:55;"With the phone also texting with Hannah and other people."
03:55;03:57;"You felt like you were at a party."
03:57;03:58;"Yeah."
03:58;03:59;"It wasn't too lonely of an experience."
03:59;04:01;"I was drinking some tequila."
04:01;04:03;"Oh, solo tequila."
04:03;04:07;"Went out and got a burger solo, like, midway through."
04:07;04:08;"It was a pretty sick night."
04:08;04:09;"Yeah?"
04:09;04:10;"But I kind of missed a lot of stuff."
04:10;04:12;"Like, they kept making references to Jet Ski."
04:12;04:13;"I missed that, too."
04:13;04:15;"I missed the first, like, 45 minutes."
04:15;04:17;"So I didn't know what was going on."
04:17;04:21;"Jet Ski, yeah, it was some joke Jimmy Kimmel made about whoever gave the shortest speech would win a Jet Ski."
04:32;04:34;"There's so much to talk about the Oscars."
04:34;04:35;"It's Hollywood's biggest night."
04:35;04:36;"It's a big night."
04:36;04:37;"It's a major night."
04:37;04:40;"Although, apparently, fewer people than ever are actually watching it on TV."
04:40;04:41;"Sure."
04:41;04:42;"Who cares about that?"
04:42;04:46;"First and foremost, this is a music show and a food show."
04:46;04:50;"So this show is for musos and foodies."
04:50;04:51;"And history buffs."
04:51;04:53;"And history buffs."
04:53;04:54;"It's not really a show for cinephiles."
04:54;04:57;"No, we touch on movies, but not very often."
04:57;04:59;"Movies is low down the list for us on time."
04:59;05:04;"And there's a lot of great radio shows, podcasts about movies for cinephiles."
05:04;05:07;"If you were a voting member of the Academy, what would you have voted for?"
05:07;05:08;"Best picture."
05:08;05:09;"Go."
05:09;05:10;"Don't think about it."
05:10;05:11;"Get Out."
05:11;05:12;"Yeah, agreed."
05:12;05:15;"Yeah, everybody that I was sitting with was really bummed that Get Out didn't win."
05:15;05:16;"But, you know, whatever."
05:16;05:17;"Yeah, awards for art."
05:17;05:18;"It's all kind of silly."
05:18;05:19;"It's all kind of wacky."
05:19;05:25;"But because, as I said, this is a music show, first and foremost, we should talk about how there's music at the Oscars."
05:25;05:26;"Right, we should."
05:26;05:32;"They nominate the best song, which is an original song for the Oscars."
05:32;05:34;"So did you catch any of those performances?"
05:34;05:35;"Yeah."
05:35;05:36;"Did you see Sufjan?"
05:36;05:38;"I miss Sufjan."
05:38;05:40;"Playing this song, Mystery of Love."
05:40;05:42;"Did you see this movie, Call Me By Your Name?"
05:42;05:43;"I did, yeah, in the theater."
05:43;05:44;"Great movie."
05:44;05:46;"A timeless film, really."
05:46;05:48;"This is a very pretty song."
05:48;05:50;"The more I hear it, I'm like, ""Yeah, it's a good song."""
05:50;05:54;"Yeah, and I think I only wish he sang all the songs in Italian."
05:54;05:55;"That's my one note."
05:55;05:56;"That would have been tight."
05:56;06:04;"I remember knowing going into the film that it was set in 1983 and that there was a Sufjan song in it."
06:04;06:10;"I remember being worried that there would be an incongruous tonal clash between--"
06:10;06:11;"But you didn't feel that way?"
06:11;06:13;"No, I think it blended in okay."
06:13;06:16;"Because the other music in the movie was of the period."
06:16;06:18;"And this has a pretty tasteful, timeless palette."
06:18;06:22;"Yeah, I mean, you can tell it's new, but it's definitely not from the '80s."
06:22;06:24;"But it wasn't jarring."
06:43;06:45;"Who did he perform with?"
06:45;06:48;"He also had Moses Somni and St. Vincent with him."
06:48;06:49;"That was cool."
06:49;06:50;"That little crew performing."
06:50;06:51;"Heavy hitters."
06:51;06:57;"I did catch the last one, I think, which was a very aspirational song."
06:57;06:59;"Was it this one from The Greatest Showman?"
06:59;07:01;"This is a big film."
07:01;07:03;"The Greatest Showman is a big hit musical."
07:03;07:05;"I love the idea of the subject matter."
07:05;07:06;"Which is what?"
07:06;07:08;"It's P.T. Bartum, right?"
07:08;07:13;"He's a fascinating figure, but the fact that it's a musical, I'm like, ""Nope, I will never see it."""
07:13;07:14;"What, you don't like musicals?"
07:14;07:15;"I don't."
07:15;07:17;"We've had this conversation on TC before."
07:17;07:19;"I don't think this is the one I saw."
08:16;08:19;"This is really just a straight up pop song."
08:19;08:21;"This is like a fight song style."
08:21;08:23;"I was just going to say, this is a total fight song."
08:23;08:26;"This is Meghan Trainor style."
08:26;08:27;"Alright."
08:27;08:33;"Those songs are tough where you're like, I mean, Queen, We Are The Champions is an amazing version of that idea."
08:33;08:39;"Let's write a triumphant song where we're brave, we're heroic, we kill it."
08:39;08:43;"That's a really hard emotion to articulate in song."
08:43;08:46;"Not many versions that do it well."
08:46;08:48;"Yeah, Star Spangled Banner."
08:48;08:49;"That's a good one."
08:49;08:50;"Eminem, Lose Yourself."
08:50;08:53;"Yeah, but that's tinged with sadness."
08:53;08:55;"He's got mom's spaghetti on his sweater."
08:55;08:57;"The infamous mom's spaghetti."
08:57;08:59;"Just straight triumph is tough."
08:59;09:00;"It's funny."
09:00;09:04;"I feel like there's more of those types of songs in the past 20 years than back in the day."
09:04;09:05;"I agree."
09:05;09:10;"I feel like most pop stars at this point have at least one song in their repertoire that's kind of like their,"
09:10;09:12;"you know, maybe for Taylor Swift, it's like Shake It Off."
09:12;09:14;"Like, you know, forget the haters."
09:14;09:16;"You're better than them."
09:16;09:21;"Was there like a Fleetwood Mac song that was quite ever that straightforward?"
09:21;09:23;"You Can Go Your Own Way?"
09:23;09:24;"Not really, though. That's different."
09:24;09:26;"That's like F off."
09:26;09:30;"Yeah, nowadays it's like that's the type of song that you need in your arsenal."
09:30;09:32;"God, that's weak."
09:32;09:34;"Such a weak form."
09:34;09:37;"I wonder if Queen thought We Are The Champions was funny at all."
09:37;09:38;"That's a great question, actually."
09:38;09:40;"That's crossed my mind before, especially--"
09:40;09:42;"Wait, throw it on."
09:42;09:47;"Also, it's funny how We Are The Champions and We Will Rock You are kind of like one song, right?"
09:47;09:49;"Right, right, yeah, they play them back to back."
09:49;09:50;"Yeah."
09:53;09:56;"So this is pretty minor."
09:56;09:57;"Well, because it starts out--"
09:57;09:58;"Please pay my dues."
09:58;09:59;"Yeah."
10:04;10:06;"Wrongfully accused."
10:11;10:13;"It also kind of sounds like Everybody Hurts."
10:13;10:14;"Yeah."
10:14;10:15;"I'd sell this record."
10:32;10:34;"Those guitar tones are amazing."
10:45;10:49;"But yeah, think about them listening back in the playback booth and just being like,"
10:49;10:53;"""This is hilarious and awesome."""
10:56;10:59;"Of the world."
10:59;11:03;"Wait, is it no time for losing or no time for losers?"
11:03;11:04;"Losers."
11:04;11:08;"That's also the thing that people forget about with Queen because it gets kind of decontextualized"
11:08;11:09;"as time goes on."
11:09;11:15;"Bohemian Rhapsody is like a totally wacky, campy, funny, satirical song."
11:15;11:19;"And then think about other early Queen [bleep] like Fat Bottom Girls."
11:19;11:20;"Right."
11:20;11:21;"""I Want My Bicycle."""
11:21;11:22;"You know, he really had--"
11:22;11:24;"Bicycle."
11:24;11:27;"He had this sense of fun, silliness in Queen."
11:27;11:28;"Right."
11:28;11:30;"Yeah, so him rolling in the studio like, ""I got an idea for a song."
11:30;11:31;"We are the champions."""
11:31;11:32;"Of the world."
11:32;11:37;"Just them in like late '70s, just like [bleep] London."
11:37;11:40;"Just like no time for losers."
11:40;11:41;"Amazing."
11:41;11:43;"I mean, it's a sick song."
11:47;11:50;"My curtain calls"
11:50;11:55;"You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes"
11:55;11:58;"I thank you all"
11:58;12:01;"But it's been no bed of roses"
12:01;12:05;"No pleasure cruise"
12:05;12:10;"I consider it a challenge before the whole human race"
12:10;12:13;"And I ain't gonna lose"
12:13;12:17;"Come on, come on, come on, come on"
12:17;12:23;"We are the champions, my friends"
12:23;12:30;"And we keep on fighting 'til the end"
12:30;12:35;"We are the champions"
12:35;12:39;"We are the champions"
12:40;12:43;"No time for losers"
12:43;12:47;"'Cause we are the champions"
12:47;12:49;"Of the world"
12:49;12:50;"Here's Mary J. Blige."
12:50;12:52;"Did you catch her performance?"
12:52;12:53;"I missed it."
12:53;12:54;"Oh, wait, no, I caught it."
12:54;12:57;"This is the first time I think that somebody was nominated for--"
12:57;12:58;"Song."
12:58;12:59;"--and actor."
12:59;13:00;"Cool."
13:00;13:02;"Life is a teacher"
13:02;13:05;"Time is a healer"
13:05;13:08;"And I'm a believer"
13:09;13:12;"Like a river while"
13:12;13:15;"Ego's a killer"
13:15;13:17;"Also, so far, all the songs nominated are, like, serious."
13:17;13:18;"Yeah."
13:18;13:22;"Like, it was cool when, like, Pharrell got nominated for ""Happy."""
13:22;13:23;"Right."
13:23;13:29;"Yeah, I feel like the tone of the Oscars songs are, like, bloated, heavy ballads."
13:29;13:31;"It's, like, not fun."
13:31;13:33;"I don't want to hide"
13:33;13:35;"No lines in the sand"
13:35;13:38;"I'm on your side"
13:39;13:44;"There was also Andra Day's ""Stand Up for Something,"" featuring Common."
13:44;13:45;"Good production."
13:45;13:50;"You can have all the money in your hands"
13:50;13:54;"Oh, this is where Common went, like, super political, right?"
13:54;13:56;"Yeah, this is from the film ""Marshall."""
13:56;13:57;"Oh, okay."
13:57;13:59;"Missed that one."
13:59;14:03;"Well, 'cause that's, you know, a serious story about the Thurgood Marshall biopic."
14:06;14:11;"You can have, you can have everything"
14:11;14:16;"I guess it's, like, with the movies, they choose the real serious ones for the most part."
14:16;14:18;"So I guess with music, they kind of do the same thing."
14:18;14:22;"It's the same way that you don't see, like, comedies ever cleaning up at the Oscars."
14:22;14:23;"Right."
14:23;14:26;"There's also just not gonna be, like, fun, goofy songs."
14:26;14:29;"Was that ""Timberlake"" song from ""Trolls"" nominated?"
14:29;14:32;"No. See, yeah, exactly."
14:32;14:35;"Maybe it should have been. Terrible song, but it was, you know."
14:35;14:37;"I've got this feeling."
14:37;14:39;"I think it might have been nominated, actually. It didn't win."
14:39;14:41;"Wait, wait, you played the Oscars, right?"
14:41;14:42;"I did play the Oscars once."
14:42;14:43;"What was that story?"
14:43;14:48;"Karen Oh wrote this song called ""Moon Song"" for the Spike Jonze movie ""Her."""
14:48;14:49;"Oh."
14:49;14:52;"And we had done kind of, like, a studio duet of it."
14:52;14:57;"And then she got invited to play, and then they asked if I would back her up."
14:57;15:00;"And Spike had this idea to direct the segment, and it's, like, really, it's cool."
15:00;15:04;"It was, like, 'cause, you know, sometimes they do these, like, big spectacles."
15:04;15:08;"So his idea was just me playing acoustic, me and Karen just singing together."
15:08;15:11;"Just sitting on the steps, and then he put, like, a big moon behind us."
15:11;15:12;"I remember."
15:12;15:13;"It's very tasteful."
15:13;15:16;"I think I was not aware that that was happening."
15:16;15:17;"Oh, really?"
15:17;15:18;"And I was just like, ""Whoa!"""
15:18;15:20;"Check it out."
15:20;15:22;"That was stressful."
15:22;15:25;"I know him, guys. I know that guy."
15:25;15:27;"I bet that was stressful."
15:27;15:32;"Well, just because I'd never played-- I've only done a handful of live TV things."
15:32;15:33;"Yeah."
15:33;15:35;"SNL, which is stressful, too."
15:35;15:36;"That seems hella stressful."
15:36;15:37;"But this is bigger."
15:37;15:39;"And also it was stressful because this was Karen's song."
15:39;15:41;"So I'm there to back her up."
15:41;15:42;"Like, imagine if I just, like, brutally--"
15:42;15:43;"Went to the wrong chord?"
15:43;15:45;"--up a chord, and she would just be, like, she's already stressed."
15:45;15:46;"It's so much pressure on her."
15:46;15:48;"She's nominated, you know?"
15:48;15:50;"Were you trying to, like, not overthink it?"
15:50;15:52;"Were you like, ""Okay, I know the next chord is a G."
15:52;15:53;"Wait, is it a G?"
15:53;15:54;"Wait, is it?"""
15:54;15:57;"I think when it happened, I didn't have time to think."
15:57;15:58;"Nice."
15:58;16:00;"And then I remember I was so exhausted afterwards"
16:00;16:03;"that I was on my way to the Vanity Fair party."
16:03;16:07;"I was, like, alone in, like, a huge SUV that, like, the studio had hired for me."
16:07;16:08;"Wow."
16:08;16:10;"And I had gone to this other party, and I was just, like, rolling solo"
16:10;16:12;"because I didn't have any pluses or anything."
16:12;16:14;"And I just remember, like, getting there at, like, 1 a.m.,"
16:14;16:16;"and they were, like, supposed to have my name."
16:16;16:17;"Like, they didn't."
16:17;16:19;"And the driver's like, ""All right, well, we'll try to sort this out."
16:19;16:20;"Let me pull over."""
16:20;16:23;"And then I remember, like, I sent a couple texts to, like,"
16:23;16:25;"whoever was supposed to get me in."

18:58;18:59;"Three and a half, whatever it was."
18:59;19:01;"They're bringing out food, and people are chatting,"
19:01;19:03;"and it's like a lively atmosphere."
19:03;19:04;"Sounds fun."
19:04;19:06;"Also, I forgot-- in classic TC fashion--"
19:06;19:09;"I forgot that I recently wrote a song for a movie."
19:09;19:10;"Yeah?"
19:10;19:12;"I should have talked about this in the last episode, but I forgot."
19:12;19:15;"Did you know that I wrote a song for Peter Rabbit?"
19:15;19:16;"No."
19:16;19:17;"What's Peter Rabbit?"
19:17;19:19;"Peter Rabbit."
19:19;19:22;"Are you familiar with the character Peter Rabbit?"
19:22;19:24;"Vaguely. It's a children's thing?"
19:24;19:25;"Yeah, he's a little rabbit."
19:25;19:27;"He wears a blue coat."
19:27;19:28;"Okay, yep."
19:28;19:30;"And it's--"
19:30;19:31;"Originally--"
19:31;19:32;"Copy that."
19:32;19:36;"Little kids have them, like these little white books"
19:36;19:38;"that are by Beatrix Potter."
19:38;19:40;"There's a whole large-- like a Peter Rabbit universe."
19:40;19:41;"Yep."
19:41;19:42;"Takes place in rural England."
19:42;19:43;"It's very sweet."
19:43;19:45;"When I was a kid, I always liked Peter Rabbit."
19:45;19:47;"I had a Peter Rabbit stuffed animal."
19:47;19:50;"So anyway, the director hit me up"
19:50;19:52;"because they were using a bunch of Vampire Weekend songs"
19:52;19:54;"in the movie, or they wanted to."
19:54;19:55;"Oh, wow."
19:55;19:56;"Is the movie out?"
19:56;19:58;"Yeah, it's been out for like four weeks."
19:58;19:59;"How's it doing?"
19:59;20:00;"It's doing solid."
20:00;20:02;"You know, I felt like--"
20:02;20:03;"Can we bring in the RA?"
20:03;20:04;"Well, first, let me tell you something."
20:04;20:05;"Yeah, yeah, go ahead."
20:05;20:07;"They're like, ""We want to use a bunch of Vampire Weekend songs"
20:07;20:08;"in the movie."""
20:08;20:09;"And I was like, ""All right."""
20:09;20:10;"They were like old songs."
20:10;20:11;"Wow."
20:11;20:13;"It was like M79 and stuff, and I was like, ""That's cool."""
20:13;20:15;"And then they said, ""Oh, and also,"
20:15;20:18;"would you want to write some original music for it?"""
20:18;20:20;"And I was like, ""I could try to write a song."
20:20;20:23;"Oh, also, James Corden is the voice of Peter Rabbit."""
20:23;20:24;"Friend of the show."
20:25;20:26;"So they were like, ""Can you write a song"
20:26;20:28;"for James Corden to sing as Peter Rabbit?"""
20:28;20:31;"And I gave it a try, and at first came up with something weird."
20:31;20:33;"And then as we worked on it, I realized it's like really annoying"
20:33;20:38;"to write something with the hard constraints of like a film."
20:38;20:39;"Yeah."
20:39;20:41;"Because, you know, I had like a lot of like talks to the director about like--"
20:41;20:43;"he was like, ""Well, we want it to be kind of this theme."""
20:43;20:46;"Because in the movie, there's a lot of talk about"
20:46;20:48;"the Mr. McGregor puts up a fence"
20:48;20:50;"and doesn't want to let the rabbits in to the garden,"
20:50;20:51;"wants to kill them."
20:51;20:53;"So he's like, ""Maybe it's this theme about like no fences,"
20:53;20:55;"and what does it really mean to be a hero?"""
20:55;20:57;"Because that's Peter Rabbit's journey and stuff."
20:57;20:59;"So I tried to like figure it out a little bit."
20:59;21:01;"We worked on it, and he helped me with the lyrics,"
21:01;21:03;"and we made this song."
21:03;21:05;"So my demo, of course, was like--"
21:05;21:07;"they wanted to be kind of like a kids' movie thing,"
21:07;21:10;"but I'm just like a laid-back, chilled-out dude."
21:10;21:13;"So my demo is pretty chilled out."
21:13;21:14;"It wasn't quite what they were looking for,"
21:14;21:18;"although they ended up putting this like at the real end of the credits,"
21:18;21:20;"which take like 10 minutes because there's so many animators."
21:20;21:22;"Second song on the credits?"
21:22;21:24;"The credits--no, it's like the fourth song."
21:24;21:28;"The credits are so long because it's like 10,000 animators worked on it."
21:28;21:29;"Oh, my God."
21:29;21:31;"This is my demo for Peter Rabbit."
21:38;22:01;"Trying to be playful."
22:01;22:02;"Yeah."
22:05;22:19;"A few references to the film."
22:19;22:21;"Nice."
22:24;22:26;"Ooh."
22:29;22:35;"This was originally the chorus,"
22:35;22:38;"but they said they needed a bigger chorus,"
22:38;22:40;"so I wrote this part."
22:46;23:03;"Try to get a high note up in there."
23:11;23:14;"French press and a blade of hay."
23:14;23:16;"That was one that I insisted on."
23:16;23:17;"That's great."
23:20;23:25;"[laughs]"
24:03;24:07;"I think one of the original lines I wrote was like--"
24:07;24:11;"♪ I love you, baby ♪"
24:11;24:14;"I always like ""I love you, baby"" in songs."
24:14;24:17;"They thought that wasn't quite right for Peter Rabbit."
24:20;24:26;"Love this demo, man."
24:26;24:29;"I was also--because they were using a lot of early vampire,"
24:29;24:33;"so I tried to go for an early vampire type chord progression."
24:36;24:39;"Ooh, is that you singing all those parts?"
24:39;24:40;"Yeah."
24:40;24:41;"Nice, dude."
24:41;24:43;"Although shout out to Greg Kirsten."
24:43;24:45;"We worked on the demo together."
24:45;24:48;"He did most of the arrangement of the backup vocals."
24:48;24:51;"So that was my little demo for Peter Rabbit."
24:51;24:54;"I referenced the wrong side of McGregor's Wall."
24:54;24:57;"I talk about carnivores because there's a fox,"
24:57;25:00;"and at one point I talk about Tiggy Winkle,"
25:00;25:02;"who is a porcupine character."
25:02;25:06;"Then we had to do a more pumped-up version for Peter Rabbit to sing."
25:06;25:08;"This is James Corden as Peter Rabbit."
25:08;25:10;"This is at the end of the movie."
25:10;25:12;"Everything's been resolved."
25:12;25:13;"It's all good."
25:14;25:15;"The couple came together."
25:15;25:18;"So this is the whole other song that you wrote."
25:18;25:21;"No, this is the movie version."
25:21;25:22;"Okay."
25:22;25:25;"So this is James Corden as Peter Rabbit, more pumped up."
25:25;25:27;"Oh, BPM."
25:27;25:29;"Yeah, BPM is kicked up."
25:29;25:35;"Slightly different lyrics, too."
26:06;26:24;"Here we go."
26:28;26:45;"More pumped up."
26:45;26:46;"I like it."
26:46;26:48;"Probably more appropriate for--"
26:48;26:49;"Sure, the end of the movie."
26:49;26:50;"Yeah."
26:50;26:53;"It reminds me so much of a Paul McCartney song."
26:53;26:56;"Well, no, the chorus that they made you to write,"
26:56;26:58;"that does remind me of Paul McCartney, Circa Revolver."
26:58;27:01;"The first two parts that you wrote remind me of--"
27:01;27:03;"Like when Paul would write--"
27:03;27:04;"Good Day Sunshine or something."
27:04;27:05;"Right."
27:10;27:28;"So you get the idea."
27:28;27:31;"Peter Rabbit came out, and immediately,"
27:31;27:34;"it was mired in controversy."
27:35;27:37;"I miss this."
27:37;27:38;"What happened?"
27:38;27:40;"There's a part in the movie,"
27:40;27:42;"and I should preface this by saying"
27:42;27:44;"I don't have any serious allergies."
27:44;27:46;"Nobody in my family does, so I don't know."
27:46;27:48;"Where is this going?"
27:48;27:49;"[laughter]"
27:49;27:52;"So basically, the film Peter Rabbit--"
27:52;27:55;"And I think when there first was a trailer,"
27:55;27:57;"some Beatrix Potter traditionalists"
27:57;28:00;"didn't like this fast-talking James Corden Peter Rabbit"
28:00;28:04;"because, you know, the books are very sweet"
28:04;28:06;"and kind of quiet feeling."
28:06;28:07;"And in this--"
28:07;28:08;"You know, he's this fast-talking guy."
28:08;28:09;"He's very self-referential."
28:09;28:11;"There's a lot of breaking the fourth wall."
28:11;28:12;"It's a postmodern--"
28:12;28:14;"It's a postmodern Peter Rabbit."
28:14;28:18;"At one point, Peter and the main human guy,"
28:18;28:21;"they get kind of in like a love triangle,"
28:21;28:22;"you know, rivalry thing."
28:22;28:23;"Okay."
28:23;28:25;"Wait, there's a human and a rabbit"
28:25;28:27;"after the same lady?"
28:27;28:30;"Well, the rabbit has like a crush on her."
28:30;28:31;"It's kind of like Rushmore."
28:31;28:33;"He doesn't have a chance, but he--"
28:33;28:35;"This is inappropriate for show."
28:35;28:37;"[laughter]"
28:37;28:40;"You can't have a rabbit lusting after a female woman."
28:40;28:42;"I think they handled it correctly."
28:42;28:43;"I don't know."
28:43;28:46;"But there's a part where he's watching--"
28:46;28:48;"He and his rabbit friends or family"
28:48;28:51;"are watching the two humans interact,"
28:51;28:53;"and he's watching with contempt"
28:53;28:54;"because he hates this guy."
28:54;28:56;"And to be fair, this guy's been trying to kill him"
28:56;28:57;"because this guy--"
28:57;28:59;"This is the new Mr. McGregor, and he hates rabbits."
28:59;29:01;"So Peter Rabbit is watching these two people fight."
29:01;29:02;"Yeah."
29:02;29:03;"He's watching them have a conversation."
29:03;29:05;"And he hears the guy say to her, you know,"
29:05;29:08;"she offers him a blackberry something,"
29:08;29:10;"and he goes, ""Oh, I'm very allergic to blackberries."""
29:10;29:12;"And then Peter Rabbit is up there and goes,"
29:12;29:13;"""Oh, my God."
29:13;29:15;"Everybody's allergic to something now."""
29:15;29:16;"Uh-huh."
29:16;29:18;"""Oh, really? You're allergic to blackberry?"""
29:18;29:20;"I mean, we've all heard somebody make a joke"
29:20;29:22;"about how everybody's allergic to gluten now."
29:22;29:23;"Sure."
29:23;29:25;"So it was a very kind of like L.A. type joke."
29:25;29:26;"And then one of his friends goes,"
29:26;29:28;"""Well, you know, Peter, some people have"
29:28;29:30;"very serious life-threatening allergies."""
29:30;29:32;"And then Peter-- this is all in the movie."
29:32;29:34;"Peter goes, ""Of course, of course."""
29:34;29:36;"And those people struggle and suffer,"
29:36;29:37;"and our heart goes out for them,"
29:37;29:39;"and we don't want to get any letters."
29:39;29:41;"So let me be very clear that some people"
29:41;29:42;"do have real allergies."
29:42;29:43;"This is in the movie?"
29:43;29:45;"This is in the movie because--"
29:45;29:46;"I like the sound of this movie."
29:46;29:47;"It's very-- yeah, like I said,"
29:47;29:49;"Peter Rabbit's always cracking jokes and stuff."
29:49;29:50;"Is this rated G?"
29:50;29:51;"I think so."
29:51;29:53;"So Peter makes this joke that he doesn't believe"
29:53;29:54;"this guy seriously has an allergy."
29:54;29:55;"Yeah, yeah."
29:55;29:56;"And then later in the movie,"
29:56;29:59;"they're fighting him kind of Home Alone style,"
29:59;30:01;"and they shoot a blackberry into his mouth,"
30:01;30:03;"and the guy falls to his knees"
30:03;30:05;"and has to administer an EpiPen to save himself."
30:05;30:08;"And the rabbits feel a little bit ashamed about it."
30:08;30:10;"But anyway, so when the movie came out,"
30:10;30:11;"there was briefly-- the first week it came out,"
30:11;30:13;"there was like a Boycott Peter Rabbit campaign"
30:13;30:16;"by the parents of children with allergies."
30:16;30:17;"Come on."
30:17;30:18;"Well, that's the question."
30:18;30:19;"I saw a lot of people--"
30:19;30:20;"Come on!"
30:20;30:22;"I saw a lot of people making that point,"
30:22;30:23;"and then I was thinking about it,"
30:23;30:25;"and I was like, ""Well, if your kid"
30:25;30:27;"was, like, deathly allergic to blackberries,"
30:27;30:30;"and then you're in a movie theater full of kids,"
30:30;30:32;"and you see a bunch of kids laughing about"
30:32;30:35;"somebody using an allergy against somebody,"
30:35;30:36;"that could be stressful."""
30:36;30:38;"It'd be uncomfortable, for sure."
30:38;30:39;"I don't think--"
30:39;30:40;"But that's it."
30:40;30:41;"Yeah."
30:41;30:42;"I mean--"
30:42;30:43;"I mean, being allergic to [bleep]"
30:43;30:44;"must be stressful."
30:44;30:49;"My wife is allergic to fish and nuts of all stripes."
30:49;30:51;"Almonds, peanuts."
30:51;30:52;"Oh, so you're--"
30:52;30:53;"No joke."
30:53;30:56;"We had an EpiPen scenario a few months ago."
30:56;30:59;"At a restaurant, there was--"
30:59;31:02;"You ordered the almond-crusted tilapia?"
31:02;31:03;"[laughs]"
31:03;31:06;"There was some, like, stupid almond dressing"
31:06;31:08;"on some Brussels sprouts, something dumb."
31:08;31:09;"Oof."
31:09;31:11;"First bite in, she was like, ""Uh-oh."""
31:11;31:12;"She feels her throat closing up,"
31:12;31:13;"the things of that nature."
31:13;31:15;"Yeah, and we just, like, got in an Uber."
31:15;31:16;"To the hospital?"
31:16;31:17;"Oh, yeah."
31:17;31:19;"She didn't have her EpiPen on her."
31:19;31:20;"Oh."
31:20;31:22;"That was kind of a harsh reminder to be like,"
31:22;31:23;"""You know what?"""
31:23;31:24;"Always roll with EpiPen."
31:24;31:25;"Roll with it."
31:25;31:32;"♪ ♪"
31:32;31:37;"♪ ♪"
32:02;32:09;"♪ ♪"
32:09;32:11;"I just want to say one last thing about it."
32:11;32:14;"Like I said, the filmmakers tried to do a disclaimer"
32:14;32:17;"in the film about how allergies are serious."
32:17;32:19;"I guess what this just goes to show is,"
32:19;32:20;"like, with a kids' movie,"
32:20;32:23;"maybe there's only so much post-modernity"
32:23;32:26;"you can get away with, so much ironic detachment."
32:26;32:27;"That's really for the adults."
32:27;32:28;"Yeah, exactly."
32:28;32:29;"It's like--"
32:29;32:30;"The kid's not going to find that funny."
32:30;32:31;"Right."
32:31;32:32;"The kid's not going to be like,"
32:32;32:33;"""Ooh, that's self-aware."""
32:33;32:35;"Yeah, exactly."
32:35;32:36;"So, you know, I can--"
32:36;32:38;"Like a 6-year-old being like, ""Wow."""
32:38;32:40;"""Were you upset about that allergy part?"""
32:40;32:41;"""Well, no, Mom."
32:41;32:42;"""Remember that really self-aware,"
32:42;32:44;"""kind of breaking the fourth wall moment"
32:44;32:46;"""where Peter Rabbit made a joke about how--"""
32:46;32:47;"""Yeah, of course not."""
32:47;32:49;"So, anyway, I can see why the filmmakers thought it was okay,"
32:49;32:51;"but at the same time, the reaction--"
32:51;32:52;"Anyway, it is a sweet film,"
32:52;32:54;"and it's doing pretty good at the box office."

33:01;33:02;"Okay."
33:02;33:04;"It's made 16 mil in China so far."
33:04;33:05;"Oh, wow."

33:07;33:09;"So your song's getting out there, man."
33:09;33:10;"The funny thing is,"

33:19;33:20;"Oh, dude."
33:20;33:21;"And I was, like, thinking about--"
33:21;33:22;"Are there other bands on the soundtrack?"
33:22;33:24;"Yeah, Portugal the Man is in it."

38:46;38:47;"Oh, that's right."
38:47;38:49;"Seinfeld, you already made this announcement on Twitter."
38:49;38:52;"Yeah, on our popular Twitter account, Seinfeld--"
38:52;38:54;"I mean, no, that's my Twitter account."
38:54;38:55;"I mean, that's popular, too."
38:55;38:56;"That's very popular."
38:56;38:58;"Time Crisis 2000."
38:58;39:01;"Yeah, so it's 8minutecapecod@gmail.com."
39:01;39:02;"Wait, wait, hold on."
39:02;39:05;"Is it like E-I-G-H-T?"
39:05;39:06;"I'm so glad you asked."
39:06;39:11;"It's the numeral eight, not the fully written out word."
39:11;39:17;"So it's the number eight minute spelled out cape cod."
39:17;39:18;"Correct."
39:18;39:19;"Spelled out one word."
39:19;39:25;"Okay, so 8-M-I-N-U-T-E-C-A-P-E-C-O-D @--"
39:25;39:29;"Gmail, also one word, and then a period, and then com."
39:29;39:31;"Just like any email construction."
39:31;39:32;"H-T-T-P."
39:32;39:33;"No, it's on a website."
39:33;39:34;"Oh, my bad."
39:34;39:36;"You could use it through a desktop browser."
39:36;39:37;"Okay."
39:37;39:39;"But you know, you'd use your phone."
39:39;39:41;"My inbox was just getting savage."
39:41;39:45;"Because we--previously, as all the TC heads know,"
39:45;39:47;"you would just have to track down Jake's email,"
39:47;39:48;"and a lot of people did."
39:48;39:51;"And someone wrote in that they Googled me,"
39:51;39:54;"and the second thing that came up was Jake Longstreth email."
39:54;39:56;"And I was like, okay, that's it."
39:56;39:59;"I'm pulling the plug on my personal email."
39:59;40:00;"So people who want to email Time Crisis,"
40:00;40:01;"it's 8-Minute Cape Cod at Gmail."
40:01;40:02;"And so we announced that,"
40:02;40:04;"and we've already been getting some emails to that."
40:04;40:06;"People have been respecting it, which I'm excited about."
40:06;40:08;"They've done the transfer."
40:08;40:10;"So one of the first emails that we got"
40:10;40:12;"was a little bit off-brand for us."
40:12;40:15;"Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
40:15;40:17;"It's from a gentleman named Kyle,"
40:17;40:19;"and the subject was open relationships."
40:19;40:22;"So, okay, this is not typical TC fare,"
40:22;40:24;"but we got a new email address."
40:24;40:26;"It's not Home Depot. It's not Classic Rock."
40:26;40:28;"Yeah, we got a new email address."
40:28;40:29;"We're starting new traditions."
40:29;40:30;"Here's the email."

42:42;42:43;"Wow."

42:45;42:47;"so we might as well try some new topics."
42:47;42:48;"Awesome."
42:48;42:50;"So first, you know, Jake and I,"
42:50;42:52;"we're very detail-oriented guys,"
42:52;42:54;"so we need some background on you, man."
42:54;42:55;"Of course."
42:55;42:56;"Age?"
42:56;42:57;"26."
42:57;42:58;"Okay."
42:58;43:00;"What part of the world are you living at?"
43:00;43:03;"I reside in Toronto, Canada."
43:03;43:04;"Okay, so you're Canadian."
43:04;43:05;"I am Canadian."
43:05;43:06;"Shout-out to Seinfeld."
43:06;43:09;"Okay, so there might be certain cultural norms"
43:09;43:11;"that Jake and I, as Americans,"
43:11;43:13;"are unfamiliar with regarding this."
43:13;43:14;"But so first we need to ask you,"
43:14;43:16;"are there a lot of open marriages,"
43:16;43:18;"open relationships in Canada?"
43:18;43:20;"Or do you imagine it's about the same as the U.S.?"
43:20;43:22;"I imagine it's about the same as the U.S.,"
43:22;43:25;"but they are on the rise, seemingly."
43:25;43:27;"Is your girlfriend also Canadian?"
43:27;43:28;"Yes."
43:28;43:31;"Oh, actually, she has Canadian citizenship,"
43:31;43:33;"but she was born in Moscow, Russia."
43:33;43:34;"Okay."
43:34;43:35;"Very interesting."
43:35;43:37;"And what line of work are you in?"
43:37;43:40;"I am a solutions architect,"
43:40;43:44;"which is like a very fancy word for fancy IT work."
43:44;43:46;"Solutions architect."
43:46;43:49;"Yeah, so I basically design back-end systems"
43:49;43:53;"for people that sell things online or in stores."
43:53;43:56;"I used to work for a company called Sears, Sears Canada."
43:56;43:57;"Oh, sure."
43:57;43:59;"And before they shut down,"
43:59;44:03;"I was trying to reformat their entire back-end website"
44:03;44:06;"and their retail stores, but then they ran out of money."
44:06;44:09;"So does any of the problem-solving you do in your line of work"
44:09;44:11;"help guide you in the situation at all,"
44:11;44:12;"or are you hitting a brick wall?"
44:12;44:14;"I am absolutely hitting a brick wall."
44:14;44:15;"It's quite the dilemma."
44:15;44:16;"So what's the latest?"
44:16;44:17;"You emailed us a week ago."
44:17;44:18;"I did."
44:18;44:19;"Any updates?"
44:19;44:20;"It's pretty chill."
44:20;44:22;"Like, I'm still--like, I love her,"
44:22;44:23;"and I know she loves me,"
44:23;44:25;"and I know that, like, she hasn't done anything,"
44:25;44:27;"like, outside of our relationship."
44:27;44:29;"Well, what part of Europe is she going to?"
44:29;44:30;"That's important."
44:30;44:32;"She is going to a few places."
44:32;44:34;"Amsterdam is one of them."
44:34;44:36;"Edinburgh in Scotland is where, like,"
44:36;44:40;"one of her friends from, like, university or something lives."
44:40;44:43;"Like, one of her best friends from, like, her childhood, basically."
44:43;44:44;"A dude?"
44:44;44:45;"A female."
44:45;44:46;"Okay."
44:46;44:47;"Wait, wait, I got a question."
44:47;44:48;"Wait, what's--"
44:48;44:49;"How long is this trip?"
44:49;44:50;"Is this, like, a 2-week trip?"
44:50;44:51;"It is a 1-month trip."
44:51;44:53;"She's away from, like, the beginning of May"
44:53;44:56;"till the end of May, beginning of June."
44:56;44:57;"Okay, so this is not--"
44:57;44:59;"It sounds sketchy, dude, right?"
44:59;45:00;"It is sketchy."
45:00;45:02;"Like, if it's just a month,"
45:02;45:05;"just leaving for a month is not a big deal."
45:09;45:11;"Take your silver spoon"
45:11;45:14;"Dig your grave"
45:14;45:24;"Heartless challenge"
45:24;45:28;"Pick your feather now pray"
45:36;45:40;"Wake up in the morning"
45:40;45:42;"See your sunrise"
45:42;45:46;"Let us go down"
45:46;45:55;"Clouds of your lover"
45:55;45:57;"Pick their prey"
45:57;46:00;"But they never look right out the window"
46:00;46:02;"Well, hold on, Jake."
46:02;46:04;"Jake coming in real hot, calling it sketchy."
46:04;46:06;"I'm just trying to go with my gut here."
46:06;46:07;"Okay, I think--"
46:07;46:09;"Of course, we've all heard of people"
46:09;46:12;"in relationships where they're about to be apart"
46:12;46:13;"for a long time."
46:13;46:14;"Sure."
46:14;46:15;"We're all familiar with that logic."
46:15;46:18;"That's like, I'm getting transferred for a year,"
46:18;46:20;"we're still in our 20s, you know,"
46:20;46:22;"we love each other, let's have an open relationship."
46:22;46:23;"This is something different."
46:23;46:25;"One month, I guess--"
46:25;46:26;"A very brief period."
46:26;46:27;"Yeah."
46:27;46:28;"Well, and also, is it something special"
46:28;46:30;"about being on another continent?"
46:30;46:31;"Wait, so you're in Toronto?"
46:31;46:32;"Yes."
46:32;46:35;"So she was just like, ""My work's sending me to Ottawa"
46:35;46:37;"for three weeks, can we have an open relationship?"""
46:37;46:38;"That would be different."
46:38;46:39;"Okay, so--"
46:39;46:40;"That would be way different."
46:40;46:42;"So that's a very good perspective."
46:42;46:45;"So is the vibe like she's going to be staying in hostels"
46:45;46:48;"with other people in their 20s and partying?"
46:48;46:49;"100%."
46:49;46:50;"Uh-huh."
46:50;46:53;"Okay, well, it's not about how do we make this relationship"
46:53;46:56;"work over the two years where I'm going to be in,"
46:56;46:59;"you know, getting my JD in Puerto Rico,"
46:59;47:00;"it's not that type of thing."
47:00;47:03;"It's really a matter of just, like, can you be cool"
47:03;47:06;"with, like, some exploratory sexual activity happening?"
47:06;47:09;"And I would make the argument, try to be."
47:09;47:10;"And that's what I--"
47:10;47:14;"So she proposes to me, like, on New Year's Day, basically."
47:14;47:15;"Yeah."
47:15;47:18;"And so I've been, like, I don't know, dealing with it in a way."
47:18;47:21;"Like, I have this very romantic sense of, you know,"
47:21;47:23;"what a relationship should be, I guess."
47:23;47:26;"Well, I mean, I guess one way to look at it, it's 2018."
47:26;47:31;"It's all about taking a new look at traditional structures,"
47:31;47:34;"whether it's, you know, awards shows,"
47:34;47:36;"whether it's traditional gender roles,"
47:36;47:39;"whether it's traditional Doritos gender roles."
47:39;47:40;"Okay, I think--"
47:40;47:44;"Jake's shaking his head show, but in matters of the heart,"
47:44;47:46;"that's eternal and timeless."
47:46;47:49;"And I don't think you can have a postmodern relationship"
47:49;47:50;"if you don't want to."
47:50;47:52;"I'm not sure if I don't want to."
47:52;47:54;"And I'm not saying put the kibosh on this."
47:54;47:55;"It sounds like a tough situation."
47:55;47:56;"It sounds like--"
47:56;47:57;"It's a dilemma, man."
47:57;47:59;"She's going to do it regardless."
47:59;48:01;"And I just want to be clear about something, like, you know,"
48:01;48:02;"that's her prerogative."
48:02;48:03;"Yeah."
48:03;48:04;"That's right."
48:04;48:07;"So on one level, you've got to play the hand you're dealt."
48:07;48:11;"And also, I can imagine you sound like a mellow dude."
48:11;48:13;"I don't think any halfway reasonable dude would ever want to be"
48:13;48:16;"in the position of putting their foot down and telling somebody,"
48:16;48:19;"""I don't want you to do something that you want to do."""
48:19;48:21;"Like, that's their prerogative."
48:21;48:22;"Yeah."
48:22;48:25;"This kind of sounds like the only advice we can give you is, like,"
48:25;48:27;"something's coming."
48:27;48:28;"How do you roll with it?"
48:28;48:29;"Right?"
48:29;48:31;"Like, that's kind of--there's no--it's happening, right?"
48:31;48:32;"Yeah, exactly."
48:32;48:37;"And any sort of, like, sense of trying to stop it feels like I'm objectifying her,"
48:37;48:38;"you know what I mean?"
48:38;48:39;"Like I'm possessing her."
48:39;48:40;"That's not a cool vibe, exactly."
48:40;48:42;"Let's accept that this is happening."
48:42;48:43;"It is what it is."
48:43;48:47;"How do we deal with things in life that just, like, come at you?"
48:47;48:50;"You kind of just got to roll with them and just kind of see where they take you,"
48:50;48:51;"I guess."
48:51;48:53;"Is it a don't ask, don't tell policy?"
48:53;48:54;"100%."
48:54;48:58;"So let's say she comes back from the trip and you're like, ""So, I mean,"
48:58;48:59;"I have to ask."
48:59;49:02;"I mean, we had this conversation about being in an open relationship."
49:02;49:04;"Did anything happen?"""
49:04;49:05;"Well, that's asking."
49:05;49:06;"You can't ask."
49:06;49:07;"That's why it's called don't ask."
49:07;49:08;"That's asking."
49:08;49:09;"Don't ask."
49:09;49:10;"I have to ask."
49:10;49:11;"Don't ask."
49:11;49:15;"I think we've got something important is that, obviously, like we said,"
49:15;49:17;"in a relationship people don't possess each other."
49:17;49:19;"People are free to do what they want to do."
49:19;49:20;"That is what it is."
49:20;49:24;"The part where you can apply your solutions architecture is just in, like,"
49:24;49:26;"being like, ""This is happening."
49:26;49:29;"If you remotely want to preserve this relationship,"" and it sounds like she"
49:29;49:32;"does, too, ""How can you be super, super smart about it?"""
49:32;49:33;"Because Jake's right."
49:33;49:39;"If you guys have a DADT policy and she comes back and you're a reasonable guy,"
49:39;49:41;"you're not going to be, like, on some, like, ""I got to know."""
49:41;49:42;"Yeah."
49:42;49:44;"Because if you're going to be like that, then you should just break up."
49:44;49:45;"So hopefully it's not like that."
49:45;49:48;"But you could get into some funny situations if you're just asking about the"
49:48;49:51;"trip and you're just like, ""In Edinburgh, did you go to any restaurants you"
49:51;49:52;"liked?"""
49:52;49:56;"And she was like, ""Oh, yeah, I actually went to this, like, really fancy place."""
49:56;49:58;"Maybe you just shouldn't talk about the trip then."
49:58;49:59;"I want to know about the trip."
49:59;50:00;"I want to know about it."
50:00;50:02;"I want to know if she went to a fancy restaurant."
50:02;50:03;"Who cares?"
50:03;50:04;"[Laughter]"
50:33;50:38;"Maybe you have to say to her, ""Listen, we're both going to be doing our thing"
50:38;50:43;"while we're apart and let's both just be very thoughtful about the information we"
50:43;50:47;"give each other because you don't want in our first conversation to end up"
50:47;50:52;"painting yourself into a corner when you're trying to just tell me about how,"
50:52;50:56;"you know, you went to an experimental theater night in Edinburgh and next thing"
50:56;50:59;"you know, I'm like, 'Wait a second.'"
50:59;51:00;"So you were --"""
51:00;51:02;"And the same might be true for you."
51:02;51:05;"So I think that's where you've got to really get into the architecture of,"
51:05;51:06;"like --"
51:06;51:07;"How do I want to design this?"
51:07;51:09;"And also, maybe you guys could do that together."
51:09;51:11;"Like, this is her idea."
51:11;51:15;"You weren't a fan of it, but it sounds like one thing that's cool is that you're"
51:15;51:19;"both invested in trying to maintain the relationship afterwards."
51:19;51:21;"That's 100% correct."
51:21;51:24;"I think there's a decent chance that she doesn't hook up with anyone either."
51:24;51:28;"I think this might be a little bit of, like, I want some freedom, you know,"
51:28;51:31;"and then it's easy to picture nothing happening."
51:31;51:34;"Are you going to keep following her on social media during the month?"
51:34;51:35;"Absolutely."
51:35;51:37;"I don't know."
51:37;51:38;"She's not a user of social media, really."
51:38;51:41;"She's very curated in her selection."
51:41;51:44;"So you've got to make sure that when you get back, there's very strong ground"
51:44;51:50;"rules so that you guys can not end up having a conversation you didn't want to have."
51:50;51:51;"That's fair."
51:51;51:55;"But so you have to decide if you want to also partake in the open side of the"
51:55;51:58;"open relationship, and it sounds like you have some hesitation about that."
51:58;51:59;"I do."
51:59;52:03;"I don't like the idea of, you know, potentially leading someone on and"
52:03;52:06;"potentially, like, not being, you know, fully honest about."
52:06;52:09;"Well, then just be honest with them up front."
52:09;52:12;"If there's someone you have your eye on, you could just be like, ""Listen,"
52:12;52:14;"my girlfriend's out of town for a month."""
52:14;52:15;"I got a hall pass."
52:16;52:19;"Have you ever seen the Owen Wilson film Hall Pass?"
52:19;52:20;"No."
52:20;52:22;"I haven't, but I followed the logic."
52:38;52:39;"Yeah."
53:04;53:06;"Let's just do one last, like, exercise."
53:06;53:07;"Okay."
53:07;53:10;"So you don't want to hook up with anybody, and don't do it then."
53:10;53:11;"That's fine."
53:11;53:13;"You really don't have to just do it just to keep up."
53:13;53:15;"Why don't you just plan on--it sounds like you have hesitation about it,"
53:15;53:16;"so plan on not hooking up with anybody."
53:16;53:17;"Yep."
53:17;53:19;"Maybe you could just, like, set some other goals for that month,"
53:19;53:20;"like sculpting your body."
53:20;53:21;"Yeah."
53:21;53:25;"Do you, like, drink protein shakes and pump iron and things of that nature?"
53:25;53:30;"I recently got into making a blueberry almond butter milk,"
53:30;53:32;"very simple shake."
53:32;53:34;"Dude, there's a lot of fat in that almond butter, though."
53:34;53:35;"Oh, I like it, though."
53:35;53:37;"It goes well with the blueberries."
53:37;53:38;"What do you recommend instead?"
53:38;53:39;"It was organic."
53:39;53:43;"You're going to want to use some coconut water, a scoop of whey protein."
53:43;53:46;"Is this your, like, one that got recommended to you?"
53:46;53:48;"This is the one that was recommended to me by the trainer."
53:48;53:52;"Just all I know is that almond butter with, like, real fitness geeks"
53:52;53:56;"has a mixed reputation because it's, like, super caloric."
53:56;53:58;"TC just all over the place today."
53:58;54:02;"I honestly think you should really set yourself, like, a deep task for the month."
54:02;54:05;"I like the fact that you're not on some, like, well, if she's open,"
54:05;54:06;"then I have to be open, too."
54:06;54:07;"Forget that."
54:07;54:08;"That doesn't sound like that's your gem."
54:08;54:12;"I think for this month you really focus on health and fitness."
54:12;54:13;"Hell, yes."
54:13;54:14;"Is there any reason why you can't?"
54:14;54:15;"No."
54:15;54:16;"Do you have a gym membership?"
54:16;54:17;"No."
54:17;54:18;"Get one."
54:18;54:20;"I'm sure in Toronto you could get, like, a one-month trial."
54:20;54:21;"Oh, one month?"
54:21;54:22;"To Good Life?"
54:22;54:23;"Yeah, go to Good Life."
54:23;54:24;"Oh, Seifeld."
54:24;54:27;"I want you to get on the Internet because, first of all,"
54:27;54:30;"exercise for most people or for a lot of people,"
54:30;54:33;"it makes you feel pretty, like, gives you a real even keel."
54:33;54:35;"Like, you know, when you're, like, super stressed out"
54:35;54:40;"and if you heard your girlfriend was hooking up with another person in Amsterdam,"
54:40;54:41;"you'd be all crazy."
54:41;54:45;"But then sometimes when you really exercise, it's almost like being a little bit high,"
54:45;54:47;"where, you know, like when sometimes you're on drugs"
54:47;54:50;"and you just, like, think about all your problems and you're like,"
54:50;54:52;"it doesn't matter, you know?"
54:52;54:53;"We're all just humans."
54:53;54:54;"We're all whatever."
54:54;54:57;"So I think I like this idea of using that month to focus on a task,"
54:57;55:02;"a self-improvement task, and then having some very clear ground rules for when she gets back."
55:02;55:05;"And also the last thing I'd say is just, like, okay, so visualize."
55:05;55:08;"Nobody likes the idea of, like, their significant other--"
55:08;55:11;"well, I guess some people--it's actually--it's a lifestyle."
55:11;55:12;"People are old."
55:12;55:13;"Some people do."
55:13;55:18;"You found out that your girlfriend had a brief hookup on another continent with somebody else."
55:18;55:19;"What really changes?"
55:19;55:20;"Can you mentally get over that?"
55:20;55:22;"Do you think it's possible?"
55:22;55:23;"I feel very optimistic."
55:23;55:26;"I feel good, positive vibes."
55:26;55:31;"And you're going to feel even better after that month of whey protein and lifting weights and stuff?"
55:31;55:32;"I bet."
55:32;55:33;"It's like a meditation."
55:33;55:39;"It's like, you know, Jake always talks to that--like the uncle being like, ""Marriage is hard work."""
55:39;55:40;"I don't know."
55:40;55:44;"There is something interesting about the intellectual challenge, which we all forget from time to time."
55:44;55:48;"You know, like if you ever find that the pain or however you feel about this is too much,"
55:48;55:50;"then you've got to prioritize your mental health."
55:50;55:52;"But there's also something interesting about saying, like, okay,"
55:52;55:54;"this is what this person is asking for."
55:54;55:56;"I'm going to try and see if I can roll with it."
55:56;55:58;"If I can't, that'll be sad."
55:58;55:59;"Breakups are sad."
55:59;56:00;"But if I can, who knows?"
56:00;56:03;"Maybe you'll find out that, like, you're stronger than you think."
56:03;56:07;"That's like kind of an interesting challenge to be like, can I roll with something that, you know,"
56:07;56:12;"back in the day the average man could not even for a second imagine."
56:12;56:14;"Can I roll with it and see, like, who knows?"
56:14;56:16;"Like that's true inner strength."
56:16;56:19;"And then you also have the outer strength from that month."
56:19;56:21;"A buff diesel body."
56:21;56:22;"Yeah, make sure that you have that."
56:22;56:24;"And maybe you could also, I don't know, take down some, like,"
56:24;56:27;"Oprah's Book Club books or something in that month."
56:27;56:29;"Just really fill that month with self-improvement."
56:29;56:31;"They're on Jake's New Age playlist."
56:31;56:32;"Oh, so good."
56:32;56:33;"I was listening to it before you called."
56:33;56:37;"You just, like, get a little bit high, go to the gym late night, get on the treadmill."
56:37;56:39;"Just, like, two hours of, like--"
56:39;56:41;"White Rainbow and Stephen Halpern."
56:41;56:44;"And you know what I love about this is, like, you have a great attitude."
56:44;56:46;"You're a very supportive boyfriend."
56:46;56:50;"If for whatever reason things are weird when she comes back, then that's going to be sad."
56:50;56:52;"But at least you gave it a try."
56:52;56:57;"And you're also going to be so ready to hit the ground running with your new health regime"
56:57;56:59;"and all the knowledge you gleaned from the book club books."
56:59;57:01;"Thank you so much, Ezra."
57:01;57:02;"Thanks, Jake."
57:02;57:03;"No problem."
57:03;57:05;"And I'm going to make you a playlist, man."
57:05;57:06;"Oh, wow."
57:06;57:07;"Really?"
57:07;57:09;"Jake's playlist for Kyle."
57:09;57:10;"What is it, May?"
57:10;57:11;"Yeah, yeah."
57:11;57:12;"I'll make it in April."
57:12;57:14;"It'll be one of the show's playlists."
57:14;57:16;"I don't know what the theme is."
57:16;57:19;"I guess it's perseverance, inner strength, and we are the champions."
57:19;57:20;"Yeah, it'll just be like--"
57:20;57:21;"And peace, love, and understanding."
57:21;57:22;"Ooh."
57:22;57:23;"That's a song right there."
57:23;57:24;"Ooh, blurry."
57:24;57:25;"What's so funny?"
57:25;57:26;"That's track one."
57:26;57:30;"Sometimes in a relationship, you got to see if you can understand something that doesn't"
57:30;57:32;"fully make sense to you."
57:32;57:33;"This relationship's 101."
57:33;57:38;"I'll admit, this is, like, perhaps an extreme case, but I think you got the best attitude"
57:38;57:39;"possible, man."
57:39;57:43;"And I also wish both of you the best of luck, because there might be some complicated emotions"
57:43;57:45;"for both of you, but she gets her month in Europe."
57:45;57:47;"You get your month at the gym."
57:47;57:48;"I love it."
57:48;57:49;"Thank you."
57:49;57:50;"Thank you both so much."
57:50;57:51;"Thanks for calling, Kyle."
57:51;57:54;"Hit us with an email in a month or two."
57:54;57:55;"Let us know what happens."
57:55;57:56;"Absolutely."
57:56;57:57;"I'll give you an update."
57:57;57:58;"All right, have a good one, man."
57:58;57:59;"Thanks, both."
57:59;58:00;"You too, guys."
58:00;58:01;"Peace."
58:02;58:03;"We stayed up all night watching a comedy show."
58:03;58:05;"Dead Edge Whiskey and Hydro."
58:05;58:08;"Good Lord, what a nice conversation."
58:08;58:11;"I'm too flawed to get anywhere safely."
58:11;58:14;"You know I talk about your highly."
58:14;58:20;"I'm fascinated for the time being we can laugh until the morning."
58:20;58:24;"We can dance in the hallway."
58:24;58:27;"Only one more night in Los Angeles."
58:27;58:31;"I really thought that I can handle it."
58:31;58:35;"But the funny thing is I was holding back tears."
58:35;58:37;"I didn't think this day would happen."
58:37;58:41;"I'd give all this up for a chance at it."
58:41;58:45;"You would have thought I'd be the man for this."
58:45;58:48;"But the funny thing is we can never say it."
58:48;58:51;"I didn't think this day would happen."
58:51;58:53;"I'm about it till it's over."
58:53;58:59;"I'm about it till it's over."
58:59;59:06;"I'm about it till it's over."
59:06;59:08;"I'm about it till it's over."
59:13;59:19;"I'm about it till it's over."
59:19;59:21;"I'm about it till it's over."
59:33;59:35;"[MUSIC - THE KING, ""DOWN TO THE BOTTOM""]"
59:38;59:43;"And don't all this new music sound the same?"
59:43;59:45;"Yeah, we must be getting old and gray."
59:45;59:48;"We left early, girl, that bear would hit me anyway."
59:48;59:51;"We went home and left our clothes up in the living space."
59:51;59:55;"Say, would you save your heart and have the power?"
59:55;59:58;"Or would you run and find another life to imitate?"
59:58;01:00:02;"It's important that we make the best of short time."
01:00:02;01:00:05;"You can never be my one and only anyway."
01:00:05;01:00:08;"Can't a young man dream?"
01:00:08;01:00:12;"Can't we all have the life on the widescreen?"
01:00:12;01:00:15;"What's the point?"
01:00:15;01:00:18;"Yeah, we had fun if only for the time being."
01:00:18;01:00:19;"I'm about it till it's over."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"Well, that was something new."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"First, I got to also say to all the listeners,"
01:00:23;01:00:26;"Jake and I are not licensed therapists."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"We're just really shooting from the hip."
01:00:28;01:00:29;"Yeah."
01:00:29;01:00:32;"That call is very ""Love Line"" style, just like off the cuff."
01:00:32;01:00:35;"Love, I don't get enough of it."
01:00:35;01:00:37;"Did you ever listen to ""Love Line""?"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"I used to listen to that when I was delivering pizzas."
01:00:39;01:00:41;"I remember there was a show called ""Love Phones"""
01:00:41;01:00:44;"with Dr. Judy that was on New York radio."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"Maybe ""Love Line"" was West Coast."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"It was Dr. Drew and Adam Carolla."
01:00:47;01:00:49;"Right, I remember when they were on TV."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"Right."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"But I never heard them on the radio."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"I mean, it's a tough one, but, you know,"
01:00:53;01:00:55;"sometimes with things like that that are really shocking,"
01:00:55;01:00:57;"sometimes you got to get over the shock and be like,"
01:00:57;01:00:59;"all right, what's the actual problem here?"
01:00:59;01:01:00;"Right."
01:01:00;01:01:03;"Real quick, remember how we kept listening over and over again"
01:01:03;01:01:06;"to that Diet Coke ad with Gillian Jacobs?"
01:01:06;01:01:10;"Look, here's the thing about Diet Coke."
01:01:10;01:01:13;"Deja vu."
01:01:13;01:01:14;"It's delicious."
01:01:15;01:01:16;"It makes me feel good."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"Makes me feel good."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"Life is short."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"If you want to live in a yurt, yurt it up."
01:01:20;01:01:23;"If you want to run a marathon, I mean, that sounds super hard,"
01:01:23;01:01:28;"but, okay, I mean, just do you, whatever that is."
01:01:28;01:01:32;"And if you're in the mood for a Diet Coke, have a Diet Coke."
01:01:32;01:01:34;"Diet Coke."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"Because I can."
01:01:35;01:01:39;"Almost Vampire Weekend light on the instrumentation."
01:01:39;01:01:40;"[Humming]"
01:01:40;01:01:41;"Yeah, a little bit."
01:01:41;01:01:42;"[Humming]"
01:01:42;01:01:43;"[Laughter]"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"So we talked about what a strange ad it is"
01:01:45;01:01:48;"and the kind of new campaign for Diet Coke."
01:01:48;01:01:51;"Nothing about dieting or, you know, less calories anymore."
01:01:51;01:01:54;"It's literally just, listen, some people are into being healthy."
01:01:54;01:01:56;"Some people just want to do what they want to do."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"I drink Diet Coke because I can."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"I've heard the rumors."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"I've heard that it's bad for you."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"I've heard it causes cancer, but I don't care."
01:02:03;01:02:06;"It's this kind of weird, like, last-ditch effort on the part of Diet Coke."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"Kind of their backs against the walls, just trying to be like--"
01:02:08;01:02:09;"They're on the ropes."
01:02:09;01:02:13;"It's a very Don Draper-selling cigarettes in the early '60s vibe."
01:02:13;01:02:16;"That's just kind of like, everybody thinks cigarettes cause cancer."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"How do we, like, sell this product?"
01:02:17;01:02:20;"And it's like, okay, so we've got some of these poindexters"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"saying that cigarettes cause cancer."
01:02:22;01:02:24;"Well, everybody's going to die."
01:02:24;01:02:27;"But did you have freedom while you were alive?"
01:02:27;01:02:30;"Lucky strike, because I can, because I'm an American."
01:02:30;01:02:32;"You fought in the Korean War."
01:02:32;01:02:33;"Now you're home in the suburbs."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"Your wife's telling you what to do."
01:02:34;01:02:36;"Your boss is telling you what to do."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"Even your kids are telling you what to do."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"And now you've got some egghead scientists telling you"
01:02:40;01:02:42;"you can't smoke cigarettes?"
01:02:42;01:02:45;"That's one of the only things that got you through being a POW."
01:02:45;01:02:48;"It's something that makes you think of brotherhood, freedom."
01:02:48;01:02:51;"That used to be your only taste of freedom when you were behind those bars."
01:02:51;01:02:54;"Lucky strike, because you can."
01:02:54;01:03:01;"So anyway, we had an eagle-eared TC head hit up the Time Crisis Twitter"
01:03:01;01:03:04;"and sent us this from the UK."
01:03:04;01:03:06;"Look, here's the thing about Diet Coke."
01:03:06;01:03:07;"It's delicious."
01:03:07;01:03:08;"Delicious."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"It makes me feel good."
01:03:09;01:03:12;"You know what else makes me feel good?"
01:03:12;01:03:13;"Athleisure."
01:03:13;01:03:15;"Because it's comfy casual."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"Look, life is short."
01:03:17;01:03:20;"If you want to live in a yurt, yurt it up."
01:03:20;01:03:22;"If you want to run a marathon--"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"Marathon."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"Okay."
01:03:25;01:03:29;"If you want a Diet Coke, have a Diet Coke."
01:03:29;01:03:33;"Diet Coke, because I can."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"You know, it's funny."
01:03:34;01:03:37;"I guess this happens all the time, but I can't think of the last time"
01:03:37;01:03:42;"I just came across two identical commercials for the US and British market."
01:03:42;01:03:46;"They really felt like Gillian Jacobs couldn't deliver that message"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"to the people of the UK."
01:03:48;01:03:53;"They should do regional ones too in the UK and the US."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"Oh, yeah."
01:03:54;01:03:55;"Like a southern one."
01:03:55;01:03:58;"Here's the thing about Diet Coke."
01:03:58;01:04:03;"Matthew McConaughey doing, here's the thing about Diet Coke."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"It's delicious."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"You want to live in a yurt?"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"Oh, yeah, it would totally work."
01:04:09;01:04:12;"Matthew McConaughey just driving the Lincoln."
01:04:12;01:04:14;"You want to live in a yurt?"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"Yurt it up, my friend."
01:04:16;01:04:18;"You want to run a marathon?"
01:04:18;01:04:21;"Well, that sure sounds hard."
01:04:21;01:04:23;"Take it easy there, Pancho."
01:04:23;01:04:24;"Yeah."
01:04:24;01:04:27;"So, anyway, the only difference with the UK version is that she goes--"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"You feel good?"
01:04:29;01:04:30;"Athleisure."
01:04:31;01:04:32;"Because it's something casual."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"Look, life is short."
01:04:34;01:04:35;"What's athleisure?"
01:04:35;01:04:36;"You want to live--"
01:04:36;01:04:37;"Like softball?"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"[laughter]"
01:04:39;01:04:47;"No, athleisure is kind of like kind of fancier jogging/yoga/athletic plus leisure,"
01:04:47;01:04:51;"meaning that a cool look that you maybe back in the day would only wear to the gym,"
01:04:51;01:04:54;"now you can wear it to the restaurant for lunch afterwards."
01:04:54;01:05:00;"You know, like a nice pair of yoga pants and a cool hoodie or, you know, some fly nets or something."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"I don't know why."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"I guess they just decided that would resonate more in the UK."
01:05:03;01:05:04;"Athleisure."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"You're not going to drink Diet Coke while you're exercising."
01:05:06;01:05:10;"Maybe the people in the UK had the brilliant insight that they were like,"
01:05:10;01:05:13;"""What's something that's actually popular now that's reminiscent of Diet Coke?"""
01:05:13;01:05:15;"And somebody was like, ""I have an idea."
01:05:15;01:05:22;"It's like athleisure in it because it's like used to be for like something healthy in it."""
01:05:22;01:05:23;"Right."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"[laughter]"
01:05:25;01:05:28;"""But now it's like this thing for just mucking about."""
01:05:28;01:05:29;"Right."
01:05:29;01:05:30;"So it kind of makes sense."
01:05:30;01:05:37;"It's like the person who's just like smoking a cigarette on a park bench wearing tight black yoga pants,"
01:05:37;01:05:43;"Nike fly nets, and a very techie windbreaker just slamming a DC."
01:05:43;01:05:45;"And you're like, ""Did you just come from the gym?"""
01:05:45;01:05:46;"No."
01:05:46;01:05:47;"""Are you on a diet?"""
01:05:47;01:05:48;"No."
01:05:48;01:05:51;"""So why are you wearing athletics gear and drinking a diet soda?"""
01:05:51;01:05:52;"Because I can, innit?"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"[laughter]"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"Piss off."
01:05:56;01:05:58;"Piss off because I can."

01:06:53;01:06:55;"- I think they probably correctly assumed"
01:06:55;01:06:58;"that Diet Coke and Athleisure have something in common."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"They're both like in this funny,"
01:07:00;01:07:02;"they're like adjacent to like a healthy lifestyle,"
01:07:02;01:07:03;"but they, you know what I mean?"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"- Right, right, right, signifiers of."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"- Right, and that's definitely a person"
01:07:07;01:07:10;"wearing like a fancy kind of sweatsuit type thing,"
01:07:10;01:07:13;"wearing running shoes, but never runs, drinking Diet Coke."
01:07:13;01:07:16;"- Just brand new gleaming running shoes."
01:07:16;01:07:21;"- Yeah, and then drinking a brand new gleaming DC silver can."
01:07:21;01:07:23;"- Getting in that Lexus SUV."
01:07:23;01:07:23;"- Yeah."
01:07:23;01:07:25;"- Hopping into the Whole Foods."
01:07:25;01:07:26;"- Uh-huh."
01:07:26;01:07:28;"- But they're not selling Diet Coke there."
01:07:28;01:07:29;"- That's hilarious."
01:07:29;01:07:30;"- Trying to make a separate stop."
01:07:30;01:07:31;"- I could do it. - Like the Vans."
01:07:31;01:07:32;"Get that 12 pack."
01:07:32;01:07:36;"- Yeah, you get a case of DC delivered to the house"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"via Amazon Prime."
01:07:38;01:07:38;"- Nice."
01:07:38;01:07:41;"- Every two weeks, and so you always have that"
01:07:41;01:07:42;"in the second fridge."
01:07:42;01:07:43;"(laughing)"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"How funny is that concept?"
01:07:45;01:07:46;"- Second fridge in the garage."
01:07:46;01:07:47;"(laughing)"
01:07:47;01:07:48;"The like immaculate garage."
01:07:48;01:07:49;"- Yeah."
01:07:49;01:07:51;"- Did you have a second fridge growing up?"
01:07:51;01:07:52;"- No."
01:07:52;01:07:53;"- We did not."
01:07:53;01:07:53;"- We had a chest freezer."
01:07:53;01:07:54;"- In the garage?"
01:07:54;01:07:55;"- In the basement, it was terrifying."
01:07:55;01:07:57;"- Oh really?"
01:07:57;01:07:58;"- Frozen meat."
01:07:58;01:07:58;"- In the chest freezer."
01:07:58;01:08:00;"- In the chest freezer."
01:08:00;01:08:01;"- In the basement."
01:08:01;01:08:03;"- There's no second fridge though."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"- We only had one fridge."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"We were a one fridge household."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"We're also a one shower household."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"- Growing up?"
01:08:09;01:08:10;"- Yeah."
01:08:10;01:08:13;"- We were for a while, and then in '87, my parents--"
01:08:13;01:08:14;"- Got a second shower."
01:08:14;01:08:15;"- Yep."
01:08:15;01:08:16;"(laughing)"
01:08:16;01:08:16;"When I was 10."
01:08:16;01:08:18;"(laughing)"
01:08:18;01:08:19;"Babe was five."
01:08:19;01:08:21;"- A major development."
01:08:21;01:08:22;"- Yeah, '87 man, the addition."
01:08:22;01:08:26;"- I totally remember, it's like such a vibe"
01:08:26;01:08:27;"when you go over to somebody's house,"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"and the kid be like, ""Want a root beer?"""
01:08:29;01:08:31;"And you be like, ""Okay,"" he's like, ""Come with me."""
01:08:31;01:08:32;"(laughing)"
01:08:32;01:08:35;"- Yeah, so that's the other wing of the house."
01:08:35;01:08:35;"And you're like, ""What is this?"""
01:08:35;01:08:38;"- It was either be in the basement or the garage."
01:08:38;01:08:41;"And there are definitely kids where that was so gnarly."
01:08:41;01:08:43;"I guess this probably happens less"
01:08:43;01:08:45;"as people become somewhat more health conscious."
01:08:45;01:08:47;"But I feel like back then in the '90s,"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"it would be that the kids who would have these two,"
01:08:49;01:08:53;"two fridge households, it would be that the one"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"is like the kitchen, of course, fridge."
01:08:55;01:08:58;"And then the other one was basically the soda fridge."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"And so sometimes you go down and these kids"
01:08:59;01:09:01;"just be like sun-kissed."
01:09:01;01:09:04;"- Right, just a cornucopia of soda."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"- Yeah."
01:09:05;01:09:06;"- I'm also wondering if there's somebody"
01:09:06;01:09:09;"who's shopping at Whole Foods once a week,"
01:09:09;01:09:11;"'cause that's what the family wants,"
01:09:11;01:09:12;"and they're trying to be healthy,"
01:09:12;01:09:13;"but they drink so much Diet Coke,"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"and they're just like, ""I'm not gonna drink"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"""whatever kind of bullsh*t soda they have"
01:09:17;01:09:18;"""over at Whole Foods."""
01:09:18;01:09:21;"So every time I'm about to roll to Whole Foods,"
01:09:21;01:09:24;"I always go to the second fridge, grab a Diet Coke,"
01:09:24;01:09:27;"and just like this parent just pounding a Diet Coke"
01:09:27;01:09:29;"that they brought from home in Whole Foods"
01:09:29;01:09:33;"as they shop for presumably organic foods."
01:09:33;01:09:34;"- I love it."
01:09:34;01:09:37;"Wait, I'm still hung up on you guys having one shower."
01:09:37;01:09:39;"All the way through both you and your sister"
01:09:39;01:09:40;"graduating high school?"
01:09:40;01:09:41;"Family of four, one shower."
01:09:41;01:09:42;"- Family of four, one shower."
01:09:42;01:09:44;"There were three bathrooms."
01:09:44;01:09:45;"- Whoa."
01:09:45;01:09:46;"- But only one shower."
01:09:46;01:09:48;"- So three crappers, one shower."
01:09:48;01:09:49;"- Yes."
01:09:49;01:09:51;"- So was that like a log jam in the morning"
01:09:51;01:09:52;"on like a weekday?"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"- No, we would all wake up at such different times."
01:09:55;01:09:56;"'Cause my dad worked on movies."
01:09:56;01:09:57;"- So he'd have like random hours."
01:09:57;01:10:01;"- He would have like the 4 a.m. alarm and sh*t like that."
01:10:01;01:10:03;"- It was just like you and Emma in the morning, just like."
01:10:03;01:10:04;"- Yeah, my mom then would probably wake up"
01:10:04;01:10:05;"at like six or something."
01:10:05;01:10:08;"And then for me, school started at eight."
01:10:08;01:10:11;"So I was probably in the shower at 7.45 straight up."
01:10:11;01:10:12;"- Oh really?"
01:10:12;01:10:13;"- Uh-huh, I'm a late riser."
01:10:13;01:10:15;"Yeah, actually I have a memory that at one time"
01:10:15;01:10:17;"they redid the bathroom with the shower."
01:10:17;01:10:19;"So that one was out of commission."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"- Yep."
01:10:20;01:10:22;"- So my dad built a temporary shower in the basement."
01:10:22;01:10:23;"- What?"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"- Yeah, very handy guy."
01:10:25;01:10:26;"I don't even remember how it worked."
01:10:26;01:10:30;"It was like, he had to turn on this like big nasty sink"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"next to the washing machine."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"And he used a garbage bag."
01:10:34;01:10:36;"- He had to turn the."
01:10:36;01:10:40;"- Yeah, he created some sort of draining mechanism."
01:10:40;01:10:45;"And I think it involved just black garbage bags."
01:10:45;01:10:45;"It worked."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"- Sounds awesome."
01:10:47;01:10:48;"- That was pretty tight actually."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"You know those basement shower days"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"were some of the best of my life."
01:10:52;01:10:55;"At the time as a kid, I felt, well,"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"why can't I use the regular shower?"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"Come on guys, can we wait it to renovate?"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"But looking back."
01:11:00;01:11:02;"- Scott's house has two showers."
01:11:02;01:11:05;"Brian's house has three showers."
01:11:05;01:11:08;"- Anyway, TC heads, we wanna get some emails from you."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"We wanna know how many fridges and how many showers"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"you had in your house growing up."
01:11:12;01:11:14;"- How about now, fridge wise?"
01:11:14;01:11:15;"- What, at my parents' house?"
01:11:15;01:11:17;"- No, no, at your spot."
01:11:17;01:11:17;"- Oh."
01:11:17;01:11:19;"- One or two?"
01:11:19;01:11:19;"Three."
01:11:19;01:11:21;"- Wait, fridges or showers?"
01:11:21;01:11:21;"- Fridges."
01:11:21;01:11:25;"- I have never had an abode with more than one fridge."
01:11:25;01:11:26;"(laughing)"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"- Just you wait, man."
01:11:28;01:11:29;"- Oh yeah, I'm saving up."
01:11:29;01:11:31;"- I guarantee you, within the next five years."
01:11:31;01:11:33;"- I'll have multiple fridges?"
01:11:33;01:11:34;"- You're gonna have a multiple fridge house."
01:11:34;01:11:36;"- It's what I've been working for my whole life."
01:11:36;01:11:38;"It depends how the next vampire album does."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"- Yep, that's true."

01:13:00;01:13:02;"had a second fridge and freezer."
01:13:02;01:13:04;"(laughing)"
01:13:04;01:13:05;"These stories."
01:13:05;01:13:10;"He had a second fridge and freezer unit in the garage,"
01:13:10;01:13:14;"and in the freezer it was frozen McRibs."
01:13:14;01:13:16;"(laughing)"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"And they would go on,"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"they would go on,"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"on special or whatever it was every year or two,"
01:13:22;01:13:23;"and this guy would go--"
01:13:23;01:13:25;"- This sounds familiar, man."
01:13:25;01:13:26;"- Did I tell a story on this show?"
01:13:26;01:13:27;"- It might have really--"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"- TC hits, episode 14,"
01:13:29;01:13:32;"Jake actually told the story about the frozen McRibs."
01:13:32;01:13:34;"- That's interesting, we weren't tackling it"
01:13:34;01:13:35;"from the same angle, though."
01:13:35;01:13:36;"(laughing)"
01:13:36;01:13:39;"Oh wait, so they would go to McDonald's and buy a bunch of--"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"- Yeah, this guy Lonnie,"
01:13:41;01:13:45;"Lonnie's dad would go buy 40 orders of McRibs,"
01:13:45;01:13:48;"and they would just be in the freezer,"
01:13:48;01:13:49;"and then I remember one time,"
01:13:49;01:13:52;"Lonnie was like, ""Okay, let's grab some and microwave 'em."""
01:13:52;01:13:54;"And we did, and it ruled."
01:13:54;01:13:55;"We were playing Nintendo,"
01:13:55;01:13:58;"this was like circa 1988,"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"microwaving some McRibs."
01:14:00;01:14:02;"- Was that like a covert operation?"
01:14:02;01:14:03;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:14:03;01:14:04;"- Oh, Lonnie's dad would not appreciate it."
01:14:04;01:14:05;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"That was his stash."
01:14:07;01:14:09;"(laughing)"
01:14:09;01:14:12;"The frozen McRibs, dude, epic."
01:14:12;01:14:15;"- Lonnie's dad just coming in, ""Hey Lonnie, Jake."""
01:14:15;01:14:17;"- Last time I looked, I had a 38 count."
01:14:17;01:14:18;"(laughing)"
01:14:18;01:14:21;"- And I'm down to 36."
01:14:21;01:14:23;"Jake, I see a slightly reddish-brown tint"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"decreasing your mouth."
01:14:25;01:14:27;"Lonnie's dad."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"- Lonnie's dad, this is kinda getting a little dark,"
01:14:29;01:14:33;"but Lonnie's dad would also tape sex scenes."
01:14:33;01:14:36;"I remember we found this blank tape."
01:14:36;01:14:38;"He had like a wall of just VHS"
01:14:38;01:14:42;"in his suburban basement,"
01:14:42;01:14:45;"and it was all just like movies taped off the TV."
01:14:45;01:14:47;"So it'd just be like, ""Rainbow First Blood."""
01:14:47;01:14:49;"And so if you wanna watch that, you can watch it."
01:14:49;01:14:51;"- Yeah, they'd have like half of the commercial,"
01:14:51;01:14:52;"and then come--"
01:14:52;01:14:52;"- Classic, dude."
01:14:52;01:14:54;"Back to the Future, all that stuff."
01:14:54;01:14:55;"And then there was like an unmarked tape,"
01:14:55;01:14:56;"and you're like, ""What's this?"""
01:14:56;01:14:59;"And then it was all just like sex scenes."
01:14:59;01:15:01;"Not out of porn films."
01:15:01;01:15:02;"It was like sex scenes out of just like"
01:15:02;01:15:06;"movies on like Cinemax or like Showtime."
01:15:06;01:15:07;"At like two in the morning."
01:15:07;01:15:08;"I remember just us--"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"- Lonnie's dad's sexual Megamix."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"- Dude, that was his mixtape."
01:15:11;01:15:12;"Clearly a time before the internet."
01:15:12;01:15:14;"- Oh my God, just like him working on it."
01:15:14;01:15:16;"Like checking the TV guide and being like,"
01:15:16;01:15:20;"""Oh, Red Shoe Diaries is playing at 1.45 a.m."
01:15:20;01:15:23;"""I gotta get up, get down there,"
01:15:23;01:15:27;"""pop that VHS in, microwave a McRib,"
01:15:27;01:15:29;"""and tape."""
01:15:29;01:15:32;"'Cause like, super mild sex scene."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"- That would really take some work back then."
01:15:34;01:15:36;"- Oh my God, dude."
01:15:36;01:15:37;"You gotta be covert too, man."
01:15:37;01:15:39;"It was a one TV household."

01:15:41;01:15:42;"- Mm-mm."

01:28:52;01:28:53;"Oh, it's not the same one?"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"- No, but it's from the same album."
01:28:55;01:28:55;"- Okay."
01:28:55;01:28:57;"- It's called ""Never Be the Same."""

01:29:01;01:29:03;"Oh, I've heard this song, I like this song."
01:29:03;01:29:04;"- Cool tones."
01:29:04;01:29:06;"- This song's cool."
01:29:06;01:29:08;"Yeah, this is like some like late '90s indie,"
01:29:08;01:29:11;"like keyboard through distortion pedal."

01:30:46;01:30:47;"- Wow."

01:31:42;01:31:43;"to take the top off a Maybach?"
01:31:43;01:31:46;"- I thought Maybach was like an appliance, right?"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"- No."
01:31:48;01:31:50;"- Like a washer dryer?"
01:31:50;01:31:51;"- No, you're thinking a Maytag."
01:31:51;01:31:52;"- Oh, you're right."
01:31:52;01:31:54;"I took the top off the Maytag."
01:31:54;01:31:56;"- That's silly."
01:31:56;01:31:59;"I didn't think literally they were singing about that."
01:31:59;01:32:00;"- He's talking about taking the top off the Maytag"
01:32:00;01:32:04;"and you're just like, you know, most Maytag washers,"
01:32:04;01:32:05;"the top just opens and closes."
01:32:05;01:32:07;"You don't have to do anything."
01:32:07;01:32:09;"- Right, it's better to call a Sears technician"
01:32:09;01:32:10;"for them to come out."
01:32:10;01:32:12;"- They took the top off the Maytag washer"
01:32:12;01:32:14;"'cause they're like, when I do my laundry,"
01:32:14;01:32:17;"I just let that (beep) spin, water goes everywhere."
01:32:17;01:32:19;"Do an open-face washer."
01:32:19;01:32:23;"- Okay, second guess of what a Maybach is."
01:32:23;01:32:25;"- I'm sorry, Maybach or Beck?"
01:32:25;01:32:26;"- Maybach, well, I don't know exactly."
01:32:26;01:32:29;"- M-A-Y-B-O-C-K."
01:32:29;01:32:33;"- No, no, M-A-Y-B-A-C-H, like the composer, Bach."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"- Oh."
01:32:34;01:32:36;"- Maybach, some people say Maybach."
01:32:36;01:32:37;"- Oh, wow, I have no idea."
01:32:37;01:32:38;"I don't have the first clue."
01:32:38;01:32:40;"Is it automotive?"
01:32:40;01:32:41;"- Yes."
01:32:41;01:32:42;"You really never heard of a Maybach?"
01:32:42;01:32:43;"- No."
01:32:43;01:32:45;"- It's a fancy car."
01:32:45;01:32:46;"Rick Ross, who had a health scare recently,"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"glad to hear he's doing okay."
01:32:48;01:32:51;"His company's called Maybach Music."
01:32:51;01:32:52;"Maybach Music."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"- So they're taking the hood off the--"
01:32:54;01:32:55;"- No, not the hood."
01:32:55;01:33:03;"- So they're turning into a convertible,"
01:33:03;01:33:04;"is what you're saying?"
01:33:04;01:33:05;"- Yes."
01:33:05;01:33:06;"- They're taking the--"
01:33:06;01:33:06;"- Yeah."
01:33:06;01:33:07;"- Okay."
01:33:07;01:33:10;"- And I'm really out of my element here."
01:33:10;01:33:15;"I mean, I really thought to get to convert a Maybach,"
01:33:15;01:33:16;"to do it right."
01:33:16;01:33:18;"- Yeah, yeah, to do it right."
01:33:18;01:33:19;"- I don't know, 15 grand?"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"- 15?"
01:33:21;01:33:22;"- I'm just totally guessing."
01:33:22;01:33:24;"I mean, a Maybach's a very expensive car."
01:33:24;01:33:25;"- I bet it's more."
01:33:25;01:33:26;"- More?"
01:33:26;01:33:27;"- What's the story with that?"
01:33:27;01:33:32;"First of all, who makes Maybach?"
01:33:32;01:33:33;"- Maybach."
01:33:33;01:33:35;"I mean, that's the name of the company."
01:33:35;01:33:38;"- It's not a subsidiary of like BMW or something?"
01:33:38;01:33:40;"- I mean, it could very well be."
01:33:40;01:33:40;"It could be owned by--"
01:33:40;01:33:41;"- Mercedes?"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"- Okay, I guess Mercedes owns them now."
01:33:43;01:33:45;"But originally it was its own company."
01:33:45;01:33:46;"Also German."
01:33:46;01:33:50;"So I guess the parent company is now Daimler."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"- Do you see those cars just like out on the street?"
01:33:52;01:33:56;"- Yeah, in like Beverly Hills."
01:33:56;01:33:58;"You gotta come out to Beverly Hills more, Jake."
01:33:58;01:34:02;"- Let's do lunch over at the Palms."
01:34:02;01:34:04;"- I got some Beverly Hills spots."
01:34:04;01:34:06;"- What are your spots there?"
01:34:06;01:34:07;"- I don't know if I wanna say them on air,"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"but there's some places you'd really like."
01:34:09;01:34:12;"- You know what TC heads waiting outside"
01:34:12;01:34:15;"these spots in Beverly Hills?"
01:34:15;01:34:18;"- Just some diehard TC heads flying in from overseas."
01:34:18;01:34:21;"- What's a Maybach run?"
01:34:21;01:34:22;"- That's a good question."
01:34:22;01:34:23;"How much does--"
01:34:23;01:34:24;"- MSRP on the Maybach."
01:34:24;01:34:28;"With a starting under 190,000."
01:34:28;01:34:29;"- Okay."
01:34:29;01:34:34;"- The S600, okay, represents considerable value"
01:34:34;01:34:36;"compared to the last Maybach models."
01:34:36;01:34:40;"The 57 cost about twice as much as the S600."
01:34:40;01:34:42;"Also it costs like almost--"
01:34:42;01:34:43;"- Like 400 grand?"
01:34:43;01:34:44;"- Yeah, 380."
01:34:44;01:34:47;"- Something's going on if they're chopping the price in half."
01:34:47;01:34:49;"- Okay, but I think the point is like,"
01:34:49;01:34:50;"I'm going out on a limb here."
01:34:50;01:34:51;"I don't have enough context for it,"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"but I think the point of making a whole chorus"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"about how you took the top off a Maybach is like,"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"not only am I rich enough to have"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"this incredibly expensive car,"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"I also do what I want with it, you know?"
01:35:01;01:35:04;"If I wanna make this expensive car convertible,"
01:35:04;01:35:05;"(beep) it, I'll spend even more money"
01:35:05;01:35:08;"and I'll decrease the value by doing this."
01:35:08;01:35:09;"I just wanna have fun."
01:35:09;01:35:12;"- Arguably increasing the resale value 'cause then--"
01:35:12;01:35:13;"- No, but you know,"
01:35:13;01:35:16;"collectors don't like aftermarket changes."
01:35:16;01:35:18;"- You don't think Jay Leno would wanna buy"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"Jay-Z's converted Maybach?"
01:35:20;01:35:21;"- Well, I think in the song,"
01:35:21;01:35:23;"the Maybach belongs to Future."
01:35:23;01:35:24;"- Okay."
01:35:24;01:35:27;"- Unless, it depends who's the narrator of the song."
01:35:27;01:35:29;"- Jay Leno would definitely wanna buy Future's"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"retrofitted Maybach."
01:35:31;01:35:32;"- Or maybe it's actually,"
01:35:32;01:35:33;"we should assume that it's DJ,"
01:35:33;01:35:35;"because the song is ultimately credited to DJ Khaled."
01:35:35;01:35:36;"It's his Maybach."
01:35:36;01:35:38;"- I think Future took the top off,"
01:35:38;01:35:41;"but it may not have been like belonged to him."
01:35:41;01:35:43;"You know, I took the top off your Maybach."
01:35:43;01:35:44;"It's like a surprise."
01:35:44;01:35:45;"- Oh, I've--"
01:35:45;01:35:46;"- Like as a gift or as like a stunt?"
01:35:46;01:35:47;"- I haven't seen the video yet."
01:35:47;01:35:49;"Maybe it's like a Uptown Girl video"
01:35:49;01:35:52;"where the whole thing takes place at a,"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"like a, you know, mechanics garage."
01:35:54;01:35:57;"And DJ Khaled pulls in and like Future,"
01:35:57;01:36:00;"or it's like Bruce Springsteen, I'm on fire."
01:36:00;01:36:01;"Like DJ Khaled comes in and is like,"
01:36:01;01:36:02;"""Hey, does anybody work here?"""
01:36:02;01:36:06;"And then Future's got like grease on his face,"
01:36:06;01:36:08;"comes out wearing a jumpsuit from under a car."
01:36:08;01:36:11;"""Hey, old Joris's man, what do you want me to do?"""
01:36:11;01:36:14;"""I want the top off this and I want it done by tonight."""
01:36:14;01:36:16;"""Oh man, sir, we don't have time for that."""
01:36:16;01:36:17;"- I'll make it worth your while."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"- I'll make it worth your while."
01:36:19;01:36:22;"Then Future has to cancel his date with Christie Brinkley."
01:36:22;01:36:24;"Then Jay-Z and Beyonce come help out."
01:36:24;01:36:26;"I don't know, anyway."
01:36:26;01:36:28;"So, so far we've covered a few genres."
01:36:28;01:36:33;"Pop, hip hop, triumphalist, secular gospel,"

01:36:35;01:36:36;"Now we've got some country."

01:55:44;01:55:45;"- Man, I don't know."

01:55:53;01:55:54;"- Fair enough."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"Well, we just banged out the top 10,"
01:55:56;01:56:00;"a diverse sampling of popular music in America."
01:56:00;01:56:04;"- I think next time we go back to a weird comparison year."

01:56:18;01:56:19;"you wanna talk about."
01:56:19;01:56:21;"- Got an email."
01:56:21;01:56:22;"Hey, Jake."
01:56:22;01:56:24;"Got it by Voices, also, like the Grateful Dead,"
01:56:24;01:56:27;"have a quite intimidating body of work."

01:56:30;01:56:32;"Thanks, Logan."
01:56:32;01:56:34;"So that's this week's playlist."
01:56:34;01:56:39;"Jake's introduction to GBV, volume one, 87 to 2017."
01:56:39;01:56:43;"It's 25 songs, and it clocks in at around 45 minutes."
01:56:43;01:56:44;"- Okay."
01:56:44;01:56:45;"- So that's the last few playlists I've made,"
01:56:45;01:56:46;"the Dead and the New Age,"
01:56:46;01:56:49;"the playlist for like two and a half hours."

01:56:52;01:56:54;"the average song length is under two minutes,"
01:56:54;01:56:58;"which is a real sweet spot for GBV."
01:56:58;01:57:00;"And the vibe is like, if you don't like the song,"
01:57:00;01:57:02;"it's gonna be over soon anyway."
01:57:02;01:57:03;"- Okay, tight. - The next one's gonna be great."
01:57:03;01:57:04;"- We'll see."

01:57:25;01:57:26;"Check it out."
01:57:26;01:57:27;"We'll see you in two weeks, everybody."
