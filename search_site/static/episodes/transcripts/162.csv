00:00;00:10;"Time Crisis back again. This week we get back to the Beatles. We talk Let It Be,"
00:10;00:19;"their new TV show, and so much more. We also talk about Corona Island, Arby's"
00:19;00:25;"Vodka, and the new Grateful Dead film. This is a very TC."
00:25;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:15;01:22;"Time Crisis back again. This one's a real time crisis. Everyone's got somewhere to"
01:22;01:26;"go, so we're trying to... Some people don't know this. Sometimes when we record Time Crisis,"
01:26;01:33;"it stretches as long as seven hours, which is quite a bit of work for the editors. In"
01:33;01:39;"fact, recently we unearthed about 60 hours of never-before-heard Time Crisis footage,"
01:39;01:44;"and using new technology, we're going to edit that down to a six-hour thing. That's going"
01:44;01:49;"to take years, though. We're going to create some very realistic animation, and that's"
01:49;01:55;"going to come out in a three-part series in a few years. But yeah, truly, we go way over."
01:55;01:59;"But today we're doing it real time. We got to really bring our A game, but we're off"
01:59;02:02;"to a bad start. Seinfeld's not even here."
02:02;02:03;"Trim the fat."
02:03;02:07;"Lord knows what he's up to. Jake and Nick are here."
02:07;02:13;"Seinfeld has a nine-to-five job, and when we tape during the day, it's a real problem."
02:13;02:15;"True. He's a working stiff."
02:15;02:17;"Yeah, we're squeezing it in."
02:17;02:19;"You're lucky, Jake. We make our own schedules."
02:19;02:21;"Yeah, I sort of do."
02:21;02:23;"[laughs]"
02:23;02:28;"Off to a killer start, guys. No fat to trim."
02:28;02:29;"Yeah."
02:29;02:31;"This is why we'll never do a TC live show."
02:31;02:32;"Tell me more about that."
02:32;02:33;"Because we're terrible."
02:33;02:36;"Unlike the Beatles, we're terrible under pressure."
02:36;02:38;"There he is."
02:38;02:43;"Well, we've never been under real pressure. Hold on. This show might be a diamond in the"
02:43;02:46;"rough. Let's not throw it away soon. Seinfeld, welcome back."
02:46;02:48;"What's going on?"
02:48;02:49;"Well, listen."
02:49;02:51;"You're looking rugged, son."
02:51;02:54;"Seinfeld's got a rugged look. Don't feel any pressure."
02:54;02:58;"However, we do have to trim the fat on today's episode. We've got to get right in."
02:58;03:02;"We're going to jump in. There's been so much TC news."
03:02;03:07;"There's such a category of TC stuff now."
03:07;03:12;"It truly feels like sometimes the universe just delivers it just for us to talk about."
03:12;03:16;"You don't even know how much good stuff there is that doesn't make it into the show."
03:16;03:20;"I hit the thread recently. I was in Paris recently."
03:20;03:23;"I was walking down the street and I kept seeing these ads for Burger King."
03:23;03:26;"Burger King France is up to some very freaky stuff."
03:26;03:33;"From what I could glean doing zero research, they have a new bacon burger and they have"
03:33;03:35;"bits of bacon in the bun."
03:35;03:40;"But we don't even need to talk about it. That's just an example of the type of TC content"
03:40;03:44;"that's just kind of flowing all over the world at any given time."
03:44;03:50;"The thing that really blew up the TC thread recently was the announcement of something really big."
03:50;03:53;"And that's the Grateful Dead biopic."
03:53;03:56;"And it's not enough that it's just a Grateful Dead biopic."
03:56;04:02;"Just to underscore how TC this is, it's directed by Martin Scorsese."
04:02;04:07;"And if you're familiar with the longstanding TC bit in my neighborhood,"
04:07;04:13;"which is a kind of thought experiment, an exercise that we do when we listen to"
04:13;04:18;"classic music of the 50s and 60s, sometimes we speak over it in an Italian American accent"
04:18;04:20;"talking about in my neighborhood."
04:20;04:22;"And that's a tribute to the films of Martin Scorsese."
04:22;04:25;"He's a major influence on Time Crisis."
04:25;04:30;"So that's one thing. And second of all, this Grateful Dead film stars friend of the show"
04:30;04:33;"multiple times as a guest, Jonah Hill."
04:33;04:37;"So to say that we're excited for this film, I think is an understatement."
04:37;04:40;"And it's made by our parent company."
04:40;04:42;"Oh, and Apple's making it?"
04:42;04:47;"In a real crazy turn of events, I actually know one of the screenwriters pretty well."
04:47;04:48;"Really?"
04:48;04:50;"Yeah, Larry Karaszewski."
04:50;04:53;"We actually had our wedding party at his house."
04:53;04:57;"Ah, yes. I thought so. So I guess I met him briefly."
04:57;05:01;"And he had texted me like, I forget when, maybe six months ago."
05:01;05:04;"And he's like, I can't say what, but I'm cooking something up right now"
05:04;05:06;"that you're going to be very excited about."
05:06;05:08;"And you said, well, hold on, Larry."
05:08;05:12;"I'm pretty sure they already have a screenwriter attached to the Richard Montaigne's biopic,"
05:12;05:15;"Flamin' Hot. Maybe they brought you in to do some rewrites."
05:15;05:17;"That'd be cool."
05:17;05:19;"I said, well, Larry, as far as I know,"
05:19;05:26;"Steven Soderbergh is not going to be directing the Robert Pollard biopic starring Todd Berenger."
05:26;05:29;"So what's left?"
05:29;05:32;"Ooh, Dead. Anyway, yeah, I was like, is this Dead related?"
05:32;05:34;"And he was just sort of like, sent an emoji that was sort of like..."
05:34;05:35;"Mums the word."
05:35;05:36;"Yeah."
05:40;05:45;"The new drunk drivers"
05:45;05:50;"Have hoisted the flag"
05:50;05:55;"We are with you in your anger"
05:55;06:00;"Proud brothers"
06:00;06:05;"Do not fret"
06:05;06:12;"The bus will get you there"
06:12;06:16;"To carry us to the lake"
06:16;06:21;"The club is open"
06:21;06:26;"Yeah, the club is open"
06:26;06:30;"Hey, the club is open"
06:30;06:35;"Come on, come on, the club is open"
06:35;06:38;"Come on, come on, the club is open"
06:38;06:41;"The main thing that I've been thinking about, and actually we've texted about this,"
06:41;06:43;"we haven't really gotten to talk about it."
06:43;06:48;"But of course, the first thing that comes to mind is like, what is this movie going to focus on?"
06:48;06:57;"I'm so curious about it because is it going to be just like opens 1961, Palo Alto, California?"
06:57;07:00;"Yeah. Jerry's giving mandolin lessons."
07:00;07:06;"I could totally picture that. Yeah, it's almost like a little bit of like inside Llewyn Davis energy."
07:06;07:08;"It's like a West Coast inside Llewyn Davis."
07:08;07:11;"Well, I guess, wait, what was he? He was a real shredder on banjo."
07:11;07:19;"Like a local banjo teacher and his young student, Bob Weir, try acid for the first time."
07:19;07:24;"And it's just like 24 hours in early 60s Palo Alto."
07:24;07:26;"Because I like that. I'm buying a ticket for that."
07:26;07:29;"It's like a prequel, right? Very square folk community."
07:29;07:37;"Maybe we have Robert Hunter entering into the CIA sponsored Stanford runs acid experiments."
07:37;07:48;"Totally. The main characters are Robert Hunter, Bob Weir, Jerry Garcia, and Corbin Bernson plays a CIA agent."
07:48;07:53;"Right. It turns out Jonah Hill playing Jerry Garcia is only in it for about five minutes."
07:53;07:57;"We just see a few scenes of him teaching banjo and mandolin lessons."
07:57;08:02;"And actually it's mainly Robert Hunter being dosed in the CIA."
08:02;08:11;"And about 50% of it's a cartoon featuring the voices of Zendaya, The Rock, and Ryan Reynolds."
08:11;08:15;"I think there could be something really fun about like the square version."
08:15;08:23;"Just like just before the tide turned. Yeah, the folk world, maybe a touch of acid."
08:23;08:27;"Some Stanford University house parties, that kind of vibe."
08:27;08:32;"That would be cool. I mean, of course, it'd be the late 60s San Francisco would be cool."
08:32;08:36;"Maybe a Scorsese, I'm sure he's read chaos."
08:36;08:40;"Maybe we'll actually, there'll be a little bit of like that energy."
08:40;08:43;"Charles Manson living next door."
08:43;08:47;"I guess, of course, it might be just the whole epic story of their whole lives."
08:47;08:51;"That's my bet. So you think this movie starts out with clean shaven Jonah,"
08:51;08:58;"kind of dressed like Peter, Paul and Mary style, little goatee, short sleeve button down shirt."
08:58;09:01;"Yeah. Was Jerry clean shaven or he had a goatee? I think he had a goatee."
09:01;09:07;"He had that like folk music look of the goatee, short hair, button down shirt."
09:07;09:10;"Like a well-oiled goatee. Yeah."
09:10;09:13;"And then it ends with like the full gray beard."
09:13;09:16;"Is it going to be like an Irishman three hour epic?"
09:16;09:21;"There's so many different Jerry hairstyles because then like early dead days,"
09:21;09:26;"it was like clean shaven, but like mutton chops with like dark hair."
09:26;09:30;"And then there was like the classic, like still dark hair,"
09:30;09:38;"but like full beard with like the sort of like aviator frames with those sort of like rose tint on them."
09:38;09:41;"And then, yeah, then obviously Papa Bear."
09:41;09:44;"Yeah. Then enters Papa Bear territory."
09:44;09:48;"Do you think there's going to be a scene with young Jerry Garcia losing his finger?"
09:48;09:51;"Oh yeah. That's a good point. Like you had to even start with childhood."
09:51;09:57;"I mean, and if you really want to get into the character, as we've talked about on the program before,"
09:57;10:00;"you know, Jerry had like a pretty harsh childhood."
10:00;10:06;"Not only did he lose his finger in a wood cutting accident, he also watched his father die."
10:06;10:07;"Oh, right."
10:07;10:11;"His father drowned in the Russian river."
10:11;10:19;"They were at a kind of a family country house, you know, out in the sticks far from San Francisco."
10:19;10:23;"And he watched his father drown as like a six year old or something."
10:23;10:27;"I mean, if it was about any other musician, a hundred percent, that would start."
10:27;10:32;"There'll be like a little kid playing Jerry with the Grateful Dead."
10:32;10:34;"Yeah. It depends how Jerry centric it is."
10:34;10:38;"That's something we also don't know because all the headlines have said Grateful Dead biopic."
10:38;10:40;"Jonah Hill set to star as Jerry."
10:40;10:44;"Now it's possible that, you know, people are making a big fuss because, you know,"
10:44;10:48;"Jonah is a famous, excellent actor. He's going to play Jerry."
10:48;10:51;"But, you know, for all we know, they just haven't cast the rest of it yet."
10:51;10:54;"And there's going to be, you know, it's about the whole band."
10:54;10:57;"I wonder if we'll get any big names playing the rest of the band,"
10:57;11:03;"or if it's going to be like Jonah Hill is Jerry and like some kind of like unknowns kind of filling out the rest."
11:03;11:07;"I thought maybe Martin Star could play Phil."
11:07;11:09;"That's a good call."
11:09;11:15;"I could see it. Yeah. I could see like you get the early days, the 60s, psychedelic counterculture stuff."
11:15;11:20;"I could see them kind of yada yaying the 70s, just kind of breeze through like, yeah, they were."
11:20;11:23;"And then like going to like touch era 80s."
11:23;11:26;"Right. Almost because like the 70s are just too good."
11:26;11:27;"Yeah. Not enough attention."
11:27;11:30;"Yeah. It's like the band was playing great."
11:30;11:35;"There'll be like a montage scene of like, yeah, man, Europe 72. That was crazy."
11:35;11:36;"Right. That was awesome."
11:36;11:42;"Apple spent 80 million dollars to bring the whole production to Egypt."
11:42;11:45;"And then we watched the movie. It's 45 seconds."
11:45;11:52;"Yeah. They did not CGI the pyramids. They shot."
11:52;11:56;"Marty, you're killing me. CGI the pyramids, man."
11:56;12:00;"Come on. Really not that important of a chapter in the dead's history."
12:00;12:06;"Long distance rider, what you standing there for?"
12:06;12:12;"Get up, get on, get out of the door."
12:12;12:18;"Playing cold music on the borrowed floor."
12:18;12:24;"Drowning your laptop, dead to the core."
12:24;12:30;"There's a jig in the matches that's too solid to tap."
12:30;12:36;"No hope in the water just to cool him down."
12:36;12:42;"Fire, fire on the mountain."
12:54;12:58;"Fire, fire on the mountain."
12:58;13:02;"What do you think the longest musical sequence in the film will be?"
13:02;13:06;"Because I assume that Marty's like a bit of a deadhead. He's definitely a rock fan."
13:06;13:09;"Yeah. I'm sure he knows their catalog pretty well."
13:09;13:15;"So I wonder if there's any, if it'll be important to him to"
13:15;13:19;"reproduce the jam experience in a cinematic style."
13:19;13:23;"If Marty will be like, it wouldn't be the dead if we didn't have at least one"
13:23;13:27;"10 plus minute jam. And I want to capture that on film."
13:27;13:31;"I mean, that could be an interesting moment that it's just a like it's an epic"
13:31;13:35;"morning do. And then, but he keeps cutting behind the scenes"
13:35;13:39;"because there's a CIA agent there trying to."
13:39;13:43;"Just to remind everyone, Scorsese's produced"
13:43;13:47;"the documentary, the six part documentary that was on Amazon."
13:47;13:51;"Right. Yeah. So he's been in the mix. His quote was there more than just a"
13:51;13:55;"band. They were their own planet populated by millions of devoted fans."
13:55;13:59;"Interesting. Are there going to be any fan characters? Jesse Plemons is"
13:59;14:03;"Dick Lotvala. I don't even know what Dick Lotvala looks like."
14:03;14:07;"Just. I have a prediction"
14:07;14:11;"guys. I think Ezra's going to get a call to"
14:11;14:15;"sort of guest in it. Cameo. Wow. That's a hell"
14:15;14:19;"of a prediction. I think Jonah knows"
14:19;14:23;"how deep it is. It's sort of like when Larry David does his remember when Larry"
14:23;14:27;"David and curb ends up being in that Scorsese film for"
14:27;14:31;"a second. I just, I can see it. You know, there's enough connections."
14:31;14:35;"I can see that being like, Hey, as you want to, yeah, maybe as"
14:35;14:39;"you know, is Dick. Marty's been trying to get me to do something for a while."
14:39;14:43;"Obviously I'm not an actor, man. I'm not an actor."
14:43;14:47;"He wanted me to pop up in Hugo. So Marty,"
14:47;14:51;"I'm busy in the studio. Irishman."
14:51;14:55;"He wanted you to have one line as an aid to RFK"
14:55;14:59;"and the Irishman. Yeah. I almost"
14:59;15:03;"did the Irishman that felt close to home. Nice"
15:03;15:07;"East coast flick. But now I truly am a terrible actor."
15:07;15:11;"Well, I remember you were, you were in girl. I remember the only time I've ever seen you on screens."
15:11;15:15;"You were in girl. I was in girls season two or something. That's"
15:15;15:19;"a great show by the way. Great program. Just an HB, just an excellent program."
15:19;15:23;"It's an HBO. It was on HBO or yeah. Or showtime."
15:23;15:27;"It definitely was premium cable. It wasn't comedy central or"
15:27;15:31;"FX stars. Yeah, that was another"
15:31;15:35;"big cameo. Ezra, you remember which one"
15:35;15:39;"you were in on the major laser cartoon."
15:39;15:43;"And triumph, the comic dog show. Well, that show was called Jack"
15:43;15:47;"and triumph, a short lived show, but I love Jack"
15:47;15:51;"and I love triumph and they wrote something. And then I just remember when I got there, I was kind of"
15:51;15:55;"I did my best. It wasn't important that I was a good actor, but I just realized"
15:55;15:59;"I was in some plays growing up and a little bit in high"
15:59;16:03;"school. And I don't know. I just realized that I don't have what it takes."
16:03;16:07;"I will say though, you know, it does have what it takes."
16:07;16:11;"Have any of you guys seen licorice pizza? I haven't seen it yet. I caught a screening"
16:11;16:15;"over here a couple weeks ago. Alana truly is an"
16:15;16:19;"excellent actor. I believe it. I'm very excited for this movie."
16:19;16:23;"Oh, you're going to love it. It's so up your alley. I'm sure. It's a pure"
16:23;16:27;"Jake film, but as far as a musician with no previous"
16:27;16:31;"acting experience, like truly excellent."
16:31;16:35;"Unnatural. We'll talk about that when more people have seen it. Back to"
16:35;16:39;"the Grateful Dead film. Yeah. I wonder, is it going to be just"
16:39;16:43;"full of, I mean, that's pretty Scorsese to have random"
16:43;16:47;"little cameos. They might be musicians. Bradley Cooper as"
16:47;16:51;"Steve Miller. Right. I mean, exactly. It's like, how much do you fill out"
16:51;16:55;"how epic and sprawling is the universe? Like, is there going to be someone playing Bob Dylan?"
16:55;16:59;"Right. Is there going to be someone playing, you know, like"
16:59;17:03;"is there a scene at Altamont? Like, is there, you know, someone playing Mick Jagger?"
17:03;17:07;"Or, you know, like there's so many. Harry Styles as Mick Jagger."
17:07;17:11;"And it's like, you know, like a 90 second scene."
17:11;17:15;"Just Jonah and Harry Styles. Jonah's like, ""Not cool, man."""
17:15;17:19;"And Harry Styles is like, ""Oh, come on, man. It's"
17:19;17:23;"all right. Come on, Jerry. Like, chill out, man."" Everybody just cool"
17:23;17:27;"out. Everybody cool out. I mean, you know, I remember"
17:27;17:31;"in the documentary, there is footage. I think we've talked about it. There is footage"
17:31;17:35;"of Jerry and Mick interacting. It's unclear if that was"
17:35;17:39;"that day or it might have been in England. And just like pretty funny"
17:39;17:43;"just to see these two dudes who are like obviously from the same era, but just"
17:43;17:47;"in many ways, as far as front men go, cannot be more different. Kind of"
17:47;17:51;"Jerry, big smile on his face and just Mick like, ""That'd be cool."""
17:51;17:55;"If that was a moment. But yeah, I think you're right, Jake. I gotta say, though, the 80s is where the drama is."
17:55;17:59;"This casting of Jonah is just genius, though, because"
17:59;18:03;"Jerry was like a very funny dude. Oh, absolutely."
18:03;18:07;"He had such a great sense of humor. And yeah, I just love that"
18:07;18:11;"they cast Jonah. Friend of the show, Jonah, because it's just, yeah. He's"
18:11;18:15;"gonna nail it. Yeah, yeah. I think it'll be great. I'm curious if he's like,"
18:15;18:19;"does he play guitar? Do you know? Does he play an instrument? We gotta get him back on"
18:19;18:23;"the show. He probably can't say too much. Well, I know that, I know Jonah plays"
18:23;18:27;"bass. I think he plays guitar. I know, I feel"
18:27;18:31;"like Jonah's into music for sure. And I'm pretty sure he"
18:31;18:35;"played bass in a high school or a college band. That's tight."
18:35;18:39;"Don't quote me on this. We'll double check when we have him back on the show. But yeah, I have this vision"
18:39;18:43;"of Jonah plays bass. In an unusual choice,"
18:43;18:47;"not everything's gonna be one-to-one in the Scorsese film."
18:47;18:51;"A few small changes. For one, Jerry plays bass."
18:51;18:55;"Just, you know, Jonah, Jonah had a little more experience"
18:55;18:59;"with the instrument, but the Phil Lesch character will play guitar. So, all the"
18:59;19:03;"music will actually be the same, but it's gonna be Jerry on bass. I just love"
19:03;19:07;"the thing about him watching like YouTube videos of Live Dead"
19:07;19:11;"and just like being in his house, like holding a guitar, like"
19:11;19:15;"just like mimicking the like physicality of Jerry and just like, I'm very"
19:15;19:19;"fascinated by this process. I mean, that's the whole fascinating thing too, is just"
19:19;19:23;"like non-musician actors who play musicians,"
19:23;19:27;"how hard do they go? I guess it depends. Does the director"
19:27;19:31;"cut around their hands or do people learn"
19:31;19:35;"just enough that they don't, that it kind of syncs up? Because you could also picture"
19:35;19:39;"like, yeah, if you get your rhythm right, say for instance you were playing like some"
19:39;19:43;"classical pianist and there are gonna be scenes of your hands moving."
19:43;19:47;"If you get the rhythm right, nobody's gonna care if like the actual audio is like"
19:47;19:48;"(imitates clock)"
19:48;19:49;"- Yeah, yeah."
19:49;19:50;"- As long as it's like, (imitates clock)"
19:50;19:51;"even if it's messy as hell,"
19:51;19:54;"just the fact that you move in time ought to be enough."
19:54;19:56;"- Yeah, just like, I mean, I feel like,"
19:56;20:00;"I'm just picturing those like kinda eighties concerts,"
20:00;20:03;"when Jerry was like so stationary,"
20:03;20:06;"but his, he had a very specific stance."
20:06;20:06;"- Yeah."
20:06;20:09;"- And very specific, like physicality,"
20:09;20:10;"which is pretty subtle in a way."
20:10;20:13;"And so I'm just, I'm just very curious to see"
20:13;20:14;"how that all plays out."
20:14;20:16;"- Or maybe there won't be a lot of music in it."
20:16;20:18;"- Yeah, it could go, obviously that's a choice"
20:18;20:19;"somebody could make."
20:19;20:22;"They could say, he might say, ""Everybody knows the music."
20:22;20:24;"""This is about the people."""
20:24;20:26;"- Who's gonna play Bobby?"
20:26;20:28;"- Yeah, I wonder, are these gonna be like,"
20:28;20:30;"I could totally see the casting of the rest of the band,"
20:30;20:32;"like they announced them and we're kinda like,"
20:32;20:34;"""Oh, we were like hoping it was gonna be"
20:34;20:35;"""just like a fun mix of people."""
20:35;20:38;"And they're just like, ""No, no, these are all like"
20:38;20:40;"""really respected New York stage actors."""
20:40;20:41;"- Yeah."
20:41;20:42;"- Like this guy was on two episodes of ""Mad Men,"""
20:42;20:46;"but he's better known actually for his stage work."
20:46;20:46;"- All right."
20:46;20:49;"- Zachary Quinto as Bill Kreutzman."
20:49;20:52;"(laughing)"
20:52;20:57;"- I'd love to get my hands on that script."
20:57;21:00;"Yeah, and is it gonna end with like Jerry dying?"
21:00;21:02;"Is it even gonna make it there?"
21:02;21:04;"- You know what would be really psychotic?"
21:04;21:05;"If it was just sort of like,"
21:05;21:07;"Jerry dies halfway through the film."
21:07;21:11;"It's 1995 and then the second half of the film"
21:11;21:13;"is about a rat dog. - John Mayer."
21:13;21:15;"- And a furtherance. - Yeah, venture against it."
21:15;21:19;"- Yeah, further venture getting to dead and co."
21:19;21:21;"- What if the whole film is like framed around"
21:21;21:25;"an episode of ""Time Crisis"" as like a framing device?"
21:25;21:28;"And you know like on an episode of ""Frasier"""
21:28;21:29;"when like ""Frasier"" is telling a story,"
21:29;21:31;"but then I get a detail wrong."
21:31;21:33;"And so they like go back, they're like,"
21:33;21:34;"you know what I mean?"
21:34;21:35;"Like, ""No, I wasn't wearing that sweater."""
21:35;21:38;"- No, no, no, no, hold on there, Niles."
21:38;21:40;"That wasn't quite correct."
21:40;21:42;"(laughing)"
21:44;21:45;"- Yeah, like Jake gets a year wrong"
21:45;21:48;"and they're like, ""Oh no, it was actually 1979."""
21:48;21:50;"And then it like flips to like a different thing."
21:50;21:51;"You know what I'm saying?"
21:51;21:52;"- Oh, absolutely."
21:52;21:54;"- It opens like this with all of us logging in,"
21:54;21:56;"you know, and sort of getting the tech right"
21:56;21:58;"of the FaceTime."
21:58;21:59;"- Yeah."
21:59;22:01;"- And then as we talk, it sort of goes back,"
22:01;22:02;"you know, flashes back."
22:02;22:04;"- Well, also I like the, when Jake talking about"
22:04;22:07;"the Dick Laudvalla character, I could totally picture it."
22:07;22:11;"It's like, it opens, you're in this dark room,"
22:11;22:14;"an archive going down these long hallways"
22:14;22:15;"filled with tapes and stuff."
22:15;22:18;"And then finally you get to a solitary man"
22:18;22:20;"sitting with headphones on"
22:20;22:23;"in this big empty kind of warehouse,"
22:23;22:26;"Daniel Day-Lewis as Dick."
22:26;22:27;"He's taking notes."
22:27;22:29;"- Hello, I'm Dick."
22:29;22:30;"(laughing)"
22:30;22:32;"- Listening to the show and-"
22:32;22:34;"- These are my picks."
22:34;22:36;"- That's our way in."
22:36;22:39;"And every pick Dick makes suddenly flashes back"
22:39;22:40;"to a different era of Dead History."
22:40;22:41;"- Oh, I love this."
22:41;22:43;"- It's that, no, that's pretty good."
22:43;22:45;"That's pretty, he just looks at the tape"
22:45;22:47;"and then it sort of starts to flash back"
22:47;22:49;"as he sort of just, you know, reads the set list"
22:49;22:51;"on the back of the tape and then puts it down,"
22:51;22:52;"picks up another one."
22:52;22:53;"He's just going through his,"
22:53;22:54;"basically going through his garage."
22:54;22:56;"- It's kind of like Titanic or something."
22:56;22:58;"- Yeah, Dick picks up the tape."
22:58;23:00;"Also there's that Steve Jobs movie"
23:00;23:03;"where they chose to tell the story of Steve Jobs"
23:03;23:06;"through three Apple keynotes"
23:06;23:10;"at three inflection points in his career."
23:10;23:11;"- Right."
23:11;23:12;"- Famously Seth Rogen as Wozniak."
23:12;23:13;"- Oh, right."
23:13;23:16;"Was that the one with Fassbender?"
23:16;23:19;"- Yeah, Fassbender was Jobs."
23:19;23:22;"So that was an interesting take to pick three keynotes."
23:22;23:26;"You could also picture this one as three dead concerts."
23:26;23:29;"I could totally see that kind of working."
23:29;23:31;"The first one's an acid test,"
23:31;23:34;"whatever that would be like 66."
23:34;23:35;"- Well, I'm thinking 19,"
23:35;23:39;"like the 65 show in Palo Alto at the pizzeria."
23:39;23:40;"- Magoo's?"
23:40;23:41;"- Yeah, you start there."
23:41;23:43;"- Yeah, it's the Warlocks."
23:43;23:44;"And they're just like walk out just like,"
23:44;23:45;"oh man, that show's awesome."
23:45;23:47;"Yeah, then maybe you cut to the 70s,"
23:47;23:50;"then like a really dark 80s show"
23:50;23:52;"just before Jerry goes into a coma."
23:52;23:57;"And then one more like kind of 90s resurgence,"
23:57;23:58;"Soldier Field, I don't know."
23:58;23:59;"- Yeah."
23:59;24:01;"- And obviously in between we have these like"
24:01;24:05;"very artful 10 minute sequences of Daniel Day-Lewis"
24:05;24:09;"as Dick returning the reel to reel to the shelf,"
24:09;24:12;"running his fingers until he finds the right one,"
24:12;24:15;"picks it up, smells it, looks at it,"
24:15;24:18;"and is instantly transported back to that moment."
24:18;24:21;"- Oklahoma City, 1974."
24:21;24:23;"(laughing)"
24:23;24:25;"- This is my pick."

25:18;25:19;"Really something to look forward to."
25:19;25:20;"Also the--"
25:20;25:21;"- When is this gonna come out?"
25:21;25:22;"Like three years?"
25:22;25:23;"- Yeah, we're not getting this movie"
25:23;25:24;"for two, three years minimum,"
25:24;25:25;"'cause they just announced it."
25:25;25:27;"They haven't even started shooting it."
25:27;25:28;"- Right."
25:28;25:30;"So they'll probably shoot it next year, hopefully."
25:30;25:32;"So maybe we'll get it in 2023."
25:32;25:34;"- Maybe, 'cause I kind of remember"
25:34;25:36;"that Scorsese's next film is called"
25:36;25:38;"""Killers of the Flower Moon."""
25:38;25:39;"- Yeah."
25:39;25:43;"- And I kind of remember it because about five years ago,"
25:43;25:46;"I started writing a song with Sam Gendel,"
25:46;25:49;"legendary saxophonist, called ""Flower Moon."""
25:49;25:50;"- Right."
25:50;25:51;"- So, you know, in the years"
25:51;25:52;"before the album actually came out,"
25:52;25:53;"every once in a while,"
25:53;25:55;"I'd be thinking about the concept of,"
25:55;25:57;"maybe I'd still be working on the lyrics,"
25:57;26:00;"or I'd Google ""Flower Moon,"""
26:00;26:01;"just to see if anything else was out there."
26:01;26:04;"So I was hyper aware when it was announced"
26:04;26:07;"that Scorsese was making a film based on a book"
26:07;26:08;"called ""Killers of the Flower Moon."""
26:08;26:10;"So anyway, that movie's still not out,"
26:10;26:11;"and I feel like I first heard about that"
26:11;26:13;"four or five years ago."
26:13;26:15;"So, you know, these things take time."
26:15;26:17;"Maybe by the time ""The Grateful Dead"" movie comes out,"
26:17;26:19;"we will have talked about it so much,"
26:19;26:22;"we will have to have actually cracked the code"
26:22;26:24;"on what happens in it."
26:24;26:25;"- Right, when it finally comes out,"
26:25;26:27;"we'll be talking about other stuff,"
26:27;26:30;"and we won't get to it for three months"
26:30;26:31;"after it comes out."
26:31;26:36;"- Guys, should we capitalize on the heat"
26:36;26:38;"and make our own ""Grateful Dead"" movie"
26:38;26:42;"to sort of come out a couple weeks before Scorsese?"
26:42;26:43;"- During Seth Rogen."
26:43;26:44;"- Yes!"
26:44;26:45;"- Well, hold on."
26:45;26:46;"- Rogen is Jerry."
26:46;26:49;"- Seth Rogen is not a friend of the show, Jonah is."
26:49;26:49;"So, look, he might be--"
26:49;26:51;"- But he's already attached to another project."
26:51;26:55;"- No, no, Jonah's attached to the Scorsese ""Grateful Dead"""
26:55;26:56;"film playing Jerry,"
26:56;26:59;"but that doesn't mean that he wouldn't wanna"
26:59;27:03;"be in our movie where he would get to play,"
27:03;27:04;"I don't know."
27:04;27:06;"- He could play himself. - Mickey Heart's dad?"
27:06;27:07;"- Ooh."
27:07;27:09;"- Oh, wow."
27:09;27:12;"First of all, Jonah would kill in that role."
27:12;27:13;"Yeah, that's great, Jake."
27:13;27:15;"In this movie, Jonah plays Mickey Heart's dad,"
27:15;27:18;"and it's just about the infamous incident"
27:18;27:19;"where he absconded with the bread."
27:19;27:21;"- I like the idea that Jonah,"
27:21;27:23;"what if, just to make it simple,"
27:23;27:27;"what if Jonah plays Jerry in our version"
27:27;27:29;"of the things we think are gonna,"
27:29;27:32;"the things that happen in Scorsese's film?"
27:32;27:33;"Do you know what I'm saying?"
27:33;27:34;"- Oh, interesting, yeah."
27:34;27:35;"- So he's himself-- - Kind of meta."
27:35;27:36;"- Very Kaufman, yeah."
27:36;27:37;"- Yeah."
27:37;27:38;"- So we get to do Daniel Day-Lewis,"
27:38;27:39;"we get to do it all,"
27:39;27:42;"but we are making what we think Scorsese will make."
27:42;27:43;"- Yeah."
27:43;27:44;"- Vignetti, it just seems simple."
27:44;27:45;"- And honestly--"
27:45;27:48;"- Also, we get all the heat of Scorsese film."
27:48;27:49;"- Very simple."
27:49;27:50;"- And I'm being totally serious right now."
27:50;27:51;"- Let's throw this together."
27:51;27:55;"- I would never dream of competing with Scorsese"
27:55;27:56;"in terms of artistry."
27:56;27:57;"He's an absolute legend,"
27:57;27:59;"he's made some of my favorite movies."
27:59;28:03;"But I will say, if we can get Daniel Day-Lewis,"
28:03;28:04;"we could really make some noise."
28:04;28:06;"We might actually blow him out of the water."
28:06;28:08;"If we could get Jonah Hill and Daniel Day-Lewis,"
28:08;28:11;"I don't think Scorsese has a chance."
28:11;28:12;"And I know everybody's thinking,"
28:12;28:14;"well, how are you gonna get Daniel Day-Lewis?"
28:14;28:16;"He's retired from acting, whatever."
28:16;28:17;"But you don't know until you ask."
28:17;28:20;"And sometimes if you bring somebody a really cool role--"
28:20;28:21;"- Huge deadhead."
28:21;28:23;"- We're all Hollywood adjacent in this circle."
28:23;28:26;"We know a little bit about how the business works."
28:26;28:28;"And you don't know until you try."
28:28;28:31;"And for all we know, he's sitting there saying,"
28:31;28:34;"all right, I announced that I retired from acting."
28:34;28:35;"Of course that some people"
28:35;28:37;"are gonna not offer me roles anymore."
28:37;28:39;"But I mean, I thought some people might try."
28:39;28:44;"Here I am sitting on my ass in a castle in Ireland."
28:44;28:46;"I thought somebody might say,"
28:46;28:47;"well, you are the greatest actor of all time."
28:47;28:49;"Here's an idea."
28:49;28:51;"I'm a little bit offended that nobody's hitting me up."
28:51;28:53;"Then somebody says, I got an idea for you."
28:53;28:57;"Dick Latvala starts thinking like,"
28:57;28:58;"oh my God, this is the role"
28:58;29:01;"that's gonna bring me out of retirement, I'm in."
29:01;29:02;"We'll have to parent trap him."
29:02;29:04;"'Cause we'll say, we'll tell him,"
29:04;29:06;"and we got Jonah Hill's Jerry Garcia."
29:06;29:08;"He might glance at the news and say,"
29:08;29:09;"oh yeah, I heard about that."
29:09;29:11;"Say, yep, that's our movie."
29:11;29:13;"And then we'll go back to Jonah and say,"
29:13;29:16;"listen, I know Scorsese's your boy,"
29:16;29:20;"but if you ever wanted to act with Daniel Day-Lewis,"
29:20;29:21;"you got it."
29:21;29:23;"- You won't actually have any scenes with him."
29:23;29:26;"He's alone in his garage."
29:26;29:31;"- It'll be like ""Heat"" where the two main actors only meet."
29:31;29:34;"They meet at a diner about four fifths of the way through."
29:34;29:35;"- I think you're right though."
29:35;29:38;"I think you get Daniel Day, you secure Daniel Day,"
29:38;29:39;"and the rest will come"
29:39;29:40;"because everybody will wanna be in a film"
29:40;29:43;"that's his first film post-retirement."
29:43;29:46;"And just tell him we're doing it micro-budget,"
29:46;29:49;"under 10K, call in favors."
29:49;29:51;"'Cause what we wanna do, I think, with this film"
29:51;29:53;"is really prime the pop."
29:53;29:54;"We're not even competing really."
29:54;29:56;"We're just priming the pop for the Scorsese film"
29:56;29:57;"that's the main event."
29:57;29:59;"- Almost think of it like a marketing tool."
29:59;30:01;"- Yeah, exactly. - Oh, absolutely."
30:01;30:02;"All ships rise."
30:02;30:05;"When there's a healthy ""Grateful Dead"" movie ecosystem,"
30:05;30:10;"maybe by the end we even get Scorsese directing this thing."
30:10;30:12;"That probably has happened"
30:12;30:14;"in some truly absurd Hollywood (beep)."
30:14;30:16;"There's two competing biopics,"
30:16;30:19;"and little by little, one of them,"
30:19;30:23;"just through all sorts of treachery and lies,"
30:23;30:25;"little by little gets people moving to it,"
30:25;30:26;"until by the end it's literally"
30:26;30:29;"the exact same group of people except for the producer."
30:29;30:31;"I'm sure that's happened."
30:31;30:33;"- I have two more casting thoughts."
30:33;30:34;"- Yeah?"
30:34;30:36;"- Adam Driver as Mickey Hart."
30:36;30:37;"- I could see that."
30:37;30:39;"- Shanning Tatum as Bob Weir."
30:39;30:44;"- Whoa, I mean, it's way too jacked."
30:44;30:49;"- Well, yeah, he'd have to slim down."
30:49;30:51;"- Right, I could see that if he slimmed down."
30:51;30:54;"Also, is there any role for Leo in this?"
30:54;30:56;"- Pigpen."
30:56;31:00;"- Leo as Pigpen?"
31:00;31:01;"- You sort of see it, like, you know,"
31:01;31:04;"when he's doing his, in the Tarantino movie,"
31:04;31:07;"when he's doing his sort of hippie,"
31:07;31:10;"you know, that's the cowboy house?"
31:10;31:13;"You know, he's doing his hippie cowboy,"
31:13;31:14;"you know, bad guy?"
31:14;31:16;"- Oh, absolutely. - In the Western."
31:16;31:16;"See that?"
31:16;31:20;"- I frankly could have modeled, you know, after that."
31:20;31:22;"- That scene when he's just putting his face in ice water"
31:22;31:24;"and just coughing?"
31:24;31:25;"- Yeah."
31:25;31:26;"- Oh yeah, excellent."
31:26;31:28;"Well, look, however you slice it,"
31:28;31:29;"this is something to be excited about."
31:29;31:33;"I'm sure it'll be returned to this topic many times."
31:33;31:35;"What else has been going on in the world?"
31:35;31:36;"I mean, we've got a list here"
31:36;31:39;"of so many TC-centric products and collabs."
31:39;31:41;"I mean, let's see."
31:41;31:42;"Let's see if we even give a (beep)"
31:42;31:43;"about any of this stuff."
31:43;31:45;"Some of this stuff truly sounds like something"
31:45;31:46;"we could have made up five years ago."
31:46;31:48;"- Should we go rapid fire?"
31:48;31:49;"Should we go rapid fire? - Let's go rapid fire."
31:49;31:51;"- And get Jake's takes maybe?"
31:51;31:52;"- Yeah."
31:52;31:55;"Justin Bieber and Tim Hortons teaming up."
31:55;31:59;"Real, fake, or who gives a (beep), Jake?"
31:59;32:00;"- Well, I like it."
32:00;32:03;"I like that he's back with his, you know, back to his roots."
32:03;32:07;"Canadian company, Canadian star, I like it."
32:07;32:08;"- I think this is big for Tim Horton."
32:08;32:11;"I don't think they've ever done a bigger celebrity collab."
32:11;32:14;"There was the Shawn Mendes thing a couple of years ago"
32:14;32:17;"with Shawn Mendes with his, he was on the Cups,"
32:17;32:19;"but this is much bigger."
32:19;32:22;"- Is there buzz in the Canadian community"
32:22;32:23;"about this, Seinfeld?"
32:23;32:26;"- I have a friend who went this morning, actually,"
32:26;32:28;"'cause I think it dropped today,"
32:28;32:33;"and he got up early to catch the heat right when they opened."
32:33;32:36;"I think there's some good buzz going about it, anecdotally."
32:36;32:39;"- And all it is is a new line of combinations"
32:39;32:41;"for its popular Timbits?"
32:41;32:43;"- Oh, that's right, yeah, Timbits,"
32:43;32:45;"which is Tim Horton's donut holes."
32:45;32:49;"Yeah, he's got his own kind of custom flavors going here."
32:49;32:53;"- He's doing chocolate white fudge,"
32:53;32:54;"sour cream chocolate chip,"
32:54;32:56;"that sounds pretty good, actually,"
32:56;32:58;"and birthday cake waffle."
32:58;32:59;"Okay."
32:59;33:00;"They were developed in collaboration"
33:00;33:04;"between Bieber and chef, Tallis Vokes,"
33:04;33:07;"Tim Horton's director of culinary innovation,"
33:07;33:10;"and they're being renamed TimBibs."
33:10;33:14;"Is Tallis Vokes like a household name in Canada, Seinfeld?"
33:14;33:18;"- No, this is the first time I'm hearing that name."
33:18;33:20;"- Let me get a number crunch on chef, Tallis Vokes."
33:20;33:23;"I'm curious about their background."
33:23;33:25;"And there was an ad for this collaboration"
33:25;33:28;"that features Bieber in a 60-second commercial"
33:28;33:31;"that shows him brainstorming with a Tim Horton's executive"
33:31;33:35;"who happily writes Bieber's worst ideas onto a whiteboard."
33:35;33:38;"I haven't seen it, but I can picture the commercial."
33:38;33:40;"This is that same type of self-aware branding"
33:40;33:43;"where everybody gets to be kind of like,"
33:43;33:45;"Justin Bieber and Tim Hortons, it's kind of awesome,"
33:45;33:49;"and it's also kind of silly and predictable,"
33:49;33:53;"so now let's have Justin kind of playing a dumb celebrity"
33:53;33:54;"who's pitching all these bad ideas,"
33:54;33:55;"and the executive's going,"
33:55;33:57;"""Absolutely, whatever you want,"""
33:57;34:00;"and they're almost poking fun at the whole concept"
34:00;34:04;"of collabs and celebrity endorsements."
34:04;34:05;"But here's what Bieber had to say about it."
34:05;34:07;"""Doing a Tim Horton's collab"
34:07;34:08;"has always been a dream of mine."""
34:08;34:11;"By the way, it's so amazing that the phrase collab"
34:11;34:15;"or collab has become just so fundamental."
34:15;34:17;"It's truly its own word."
34:17;34:18;"- Right."
34:18;34:19;"- Has always been a dream."
34:19;34:21;"Like, yeah, when Justin Bieber was seven,"
34:21;34:22;"was he thinking about like,"
34:22;34:23;"when he walked into Tim Hortons,"
34:23;34:27;"he was thinking, ""One day I want to collab with you."""
34:27;34:28;"I grew up on Tim Hortons."
34:28;34:30;"It's always been something close to my heart."
34:30;34:31;"I'm sure that's true."
34:31;34:33;"I'm sure he really does have a deep affection for the brand."
34:33;34:36;"♪ Yeah, you got that yummy, yummy ♪"
34:36;34:40;"♪ Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy ♪"
34:40;34:42;"♪ Yeah, you got that yummy, yummy ♪"
34:42;34:45;"♪ Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy ♪"
34:45;34:47;"♪ Say the word, on my way ♪"

34:58;35:00;"♪ Say the word, on my way ♪"
35:00;35:04;"- So, Tell Us Vogue's is a splashy new hire for Tim Hortons."
35:04;35:09;"He actually joined the TH team at the start of 2021."
35:09;35:10;"He's a top chef."
35:10;35:13;"He's worked at Nobu."
35:13;35:16;"He's worked at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant."
35:16;35:17;"(laughing)"
35:17;35:19;"- Wait, what?"
35:19;35:20;"Nobu? - For real?"
35:20;35:24;"- Is that their fancy sushi place in Malibu?"
35:24;35:26;"- Yeah, well, it's not just Malibu."
35:26;35:27;"- It's all around the world."
35:27;35:29;"- Robert De Niro is--"
35:29;35:31;"- Robert De Niro is a co-owner."
35:31;35:32;"- Okay."
35:32;35:34;"- So that means that there's only three degrees"
35:34;35:38;"of connection between the Grateful Dead movie"
35:38;35:40;"and the Justin Bieber-Tim Hortons collab."
35:40;35:41;"- That's right."
35:41;35:45;"- Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Tell Us Vogue's, Justin Bieber."
35:45;35:47;"Everything's connected."
35:47;35:48;"- And Tell Us Vogue's really--"
35:48;35:49;"- Everything's connected."
35:49;35:50;"- It's all connected."
35:50;35:51;"He's very impressive."
35:51;35:54;"His role, by the way, is he's culinary lead at Tim Hortons."
35:54;35:57;"He's worked at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, May's,"
35:57;35:59;"which closed in 2018."
35:59;36:04;"But of note, he's the food stylist for The Handmaid's Tale."
36:04;36:05;"So anytime you see--"
36:05;36:06;"(laughing)"
36:06;36:08;"- What the hell?"
36:08;36:10;"- Well, anytime you see a shot, like a beauty shot"
36:10;36:14;"in The Handmaid's Tale, which is shot, by the way,"
36:14;36:16;"in Canada, side note."
36:16;36:19;"When you see a beautifully stylized shot of some bread"
36:19;36:22;"or perhaps some porridge for the handmaids to dole out,"
36:22;36:26;"that has been styled by Tell Us Vogue's."
36:26;36:29;"- I'm not hatin', that's a very random CV,"
36:29;36:32;"but you know what, we all have random CVs."
36:32;36:33;"It's 2021."
36:33;36:34;"- Yeah."
36:34;36:37;"- Our talents take us to various places."
36:37;36:40;"- You call it random, I call it diversified."
36:40;36:42;"- Oh yeah, I call it smart. - Yes, very diversified."
36:42;36:45;"- Oh no, let's not knock Tell Us side hustles here."
36:45;36:49;"His resume is a tapestry of interesting things."
36:49;36:53;"- There's just some big, disgusting, sweaty ham on the table."
36:53;36:54;"(laughing)"
36:54;36:57;"- Take eight of this scene in The Handmaid's Tale,"
36:57;36:59;"he's like, ""Hold on, I gotta get in there."""
36:59;37:01;"Like a spray bottle, just like re-glistening it."
37:01;37:04;"Amazing."
37:04;37:07;"- He's doing some press for some weird"
37:07;37:11;"post-modern academic journal, and just talking about,"
37:11;37:13;"""You know, I really tried to bring some of the kind"
37:13;37:17;"""of dystopian food stylings that I did on The Handmaid's Tale"
37:17;37:19;"""to the Justin Bieber collab."
37:19;37:22;"""There truly is nothing more dystopian"
37:22;37:24;"""than the concept of Tim Biebs."""
37:24;37:26;"It's kind of a bit of Justin Bieber,"
37:26;37:30;"a bit of Handmaid's Tale, a little bit of Nobu."
37:30;37:33;"I brought my whole history into this project."
37:33;37:37;"- I like also, he's doing Handmaid's Tale,"
37:37;37:39;"and he's really trying to sort of cross-promote,"
37:39;37:41;"and he keeps slipping Tim bits."
37:41;37:44;"(laughing)"
37:44;37:45;"Come on!"
37:45;37:48;"Enough with the Tim bits."
37:48;37:52;"- When's the Handmaid's Tale Tim Horton's collection dropping?"
37:52;37:53;"Can you find an email for Talas?"
37:53;37:55;"That'd be a cool guest."
37:55;37:56;"- He's on LinkedIn."
37:56;37:57;"- Great."
37:57;37:58;"- We could talk to him."
37:58;38:00;"- I think that this is an important,"
38:00;38:01;"we've been talking about Tim Hortons"
38:01;38:03;"for a long time on this show."
38:03;38:05;"This is a really interesting collab."
38:05;38:08;"So I'll just say, for an upcoming episode,"
38:08;38:11;"let's put out feelers, and if we can either get"
38:11;38:14;"Justin Bieber or Chef Talas Vokes, I'll be happy."
38:14;38:16;"- What's next?"
38:16;38:17;"- What's next?"
38:17;38:20;"Applebee's Cheetos Boneless Wings."
38:20;38:21;"- Gross."
38:21;38:23;"- Also, truly, we've reached the singularity."
38:23;38:25;"Everything, it's all come together."
38:25;38:27;"Everything exists."
38:27;38:29;"Actually, I know that's not what the singularity really is,"
38:29;38:31;"but this is the TC singularity,"
38:31;38:36;"is just when every kind of like bizarre food collab"
38:36;38:37;"already exists."
38:37;38:38;"- Yeah."
38:38;38:41;"That's not even like shocking or interesting."
38:41;38:43;"It's just sort of like--"
38:43;38:44;"- That's pure who gives a (beep)"
38:44;38:47;"- It feels like this really just depressing,"
38:47;38:49;"inevitable conclusion."
38:49;38:50;"Moving on."
38:50;38:51;"- I just want to say,"
38:51;38:53;"I believe we've talked about this before,"
38:53;38:55;"but really a boneless wing,"
38:55;38:57;"I mean, it's disgusting in its name."
38:57;38:59;"It's grotesque, but really a boneless wing"
38:59;39:01;"is just a chicken finger."
39:01;39:05;"I mean, even calling it, you know what I'm saying?"
39:05;39:07;"- I know, but it's not breaded and fried."
39:07;39:10;"- Or it's not, I mean, a chicken nugget"
39:10;39:14;"or a chicken finger would be like ground chicken"
39:14;39:16;"that's like put into a patty and breaded."
39:16;39:17;"- Wait, is this a slurry?"
39:17;39:18;"Is this a slurry?"
39:18;39:18;"- Is this a slurry?"
39:18;39:19;"Yeah, is a boneless wing a slurry?"
39:19;39:20;"- I think it's a slurry."
39:20;39:24;"I think they're just ripping the bones out of the wings."
39:24;39:25;"- Who's doing that?"
39:25;39:25;"- I assume you do that."
39:25;39:26;"- Mechanically?"
39:26;39:28;"- Oh, absolutely mechanically."
39:28;39:29;"- Okay."
39:29;39:31;"- Well, yeah, I don't want to talk about--"
39:31;39:32;"- This is disgusting."
39:32;39:33;"- But hold on, let's move on."
39:33;39:34;"- Jake, wait, wait, no, Jake, Jake, I'm sorry."
39:34;39:37;"Before we move on, I just want to--"
39:37;39:39;"- I gotta move us on, guys."
39:39;39:40;"We're on a tight schedule."
39:40;39:42;"(laughing)"
39:42;39:44;"- I think the word slurry,"
39:44;39:46;"that's a trigger word for Jake, slurry."
39:46;39:50;"- Well, I think also we did a whole 45 minutes,"
39:50;39:51;"one episode about slurries."
39:51;39:56;"And I remember the listener response was negative,"
39:56;39:56;"to say the least."
39:56;39:57;"People were really--"
39:57;39:59;"- The TC heads don't like meat slurries."
39:59;40:03;"- No one wants to hear about industrialized meat production."
40:03;40:04;"- Before we move on, Jake, I just want to--"
40:04;40:05;"- I got it."
40:06;40:11;"I just need to read one quote from Joel Yashinsky,"
40:11;40:14;"the chief marketing officer for Applebee's."
40:14;40:16;"And he said, ""Incorporating Cheetos into the menu"
40:16;40:21;"is a way to, quote, 'reach out to the Gen Z demo,"
40:21;40:22;"specifically and directly."
40:22;40:24;"We see this as a great opportunity"
40:24;40:27;"to really connect with them on flavors.'"""
40:27;40:28;"That just gives us some insight"
40:28;40:31;"into how the marketing world thinks about Cheetos."
40:31;40:34;"And by the way, these come in both original Cheetos flavors"
40:34;40:35;"and Flaming Hot."
40:35;40:37;"And I guess Gen Z has spoken."
40:37;40:39;"It's a Cheetos generation."
40:39;40:42;"And the marketing world is listening to them."
40:42;40:44;"- Gen G, Gen G."
40:44;40:46;"- Gen, yeah, Gen G."
40:46;40:48;"Yeah, Gen G, C-H-E-E."
40:48;40:51;"- Guarantee you that product is bombing."
40:51;40:52;"- I don't know."
40:52;40:53;"- I don't know, man."

42:00;42:03;"I mean, truly, just the hits keep on coming."
42:03;42:05;"We truly live in the TCU."
42:05;42:09;"The TCU was expanding at such a rapid rate"
42:09;42:12;"that it is now exactly the same size as the known universe."
42:12;42:15;"In other words, we live inside the time crisis universe."
42:15;42:18;"Now we have Arby's Vodka."
42:18;42:19;"Arby's released two limited edition"
42:19;42:21;"French fry flavored vodkas."
42:21;42:25;"Arby's Curly Fry and Crinkle Fry Vodka."
42:25;42:27;"It's a way to celebrate the addition"
42:27;42:29;"of crinkle fries to the Arby's menu."
42:29;42:30;"- Insane."
42:30;42:31;"- Well, okay."
42:31;42:33;"- Does this even actually exist?"
42:33;42:34;"- I know, this is like a truly,"
42:34;42:36;"this product doesn't exist."
42:36;42:39;"- Who the hell would want this?"
42:39;42:41;"The whole point of vodka too is that it's flavorless, right?"
42:41;42:43;"You add stuff to it."
42:43;42:45;"- Well, people like flavored vodka."
42:45;42:49;"I mean, have you ever been to like the Russian Tea Room"
42:49;42:49;"or something like that?"
42:49;42:51;"Sometimes when you go to like a Russian place,"
42:51;42:55;"they'll have like all these different kinds of vodka"
42:55;42:58;"that are different colors infused."
42:58;42:58;"- Yeah, yeah."
42:58;43:00;"- These are made from high quality potato vodka."
43:00;43:02;"So I guess it makes sense."
43:02;43:03;"It's potato on potato."
43:03;43:05;"- But I agree, this feels like another one of these,"
43:05;43:07;"does this exist?"
43:07;43:10;"Or did they make 10 bottles as a goof,"
43:10;43:13;"mail them out to like regional distributors"
43:13;43:15;"and then just got some press?"
43:15;43:16;"- That's all it is."
43:16;43:18;"I mean, whatever."
43:18;43:22;"- I have a bit of a non-story around this product."
43:22;43:24;"Hey, if you'll indulge me."
43:24;43:27;"Well, when the news broke that this vodka was coming out,"
43:27;43:30;"I remembered that Arby's is following"
43:30;43:33;"my popular Seinfeld Twitter account"
43:33;43:35;"and I DMed them and I said,"
43:35;43:38;"""Hi Arby's, can I please get some vodka?"""
43:38;43:40;"No response for six days."
43:40;43:43;"And then they replied, ""Drive to your nearest computer"
43:43;43:45;"""and go to arbysvodka.com."""
43:45;43:47;"And it was just a place where I could fill out a thing"
43:47;43:49;"and pay for the vodka."
43:49;43:50;"- Wow."
43:50;43:53;"- Yeah, it felt like a bit of a diss, but there you go."
43:53;43:55;"- And they said drive to your nearest computer?"
43:55;43:58;"- Yeah, I don't know why that was the verb,"
43:58;43:59;"but they're saying, you know,"
43:59;44:01;"""Here's where you can purchase it."""
44:01;44:02;"- That's disrespectful."
44:02;44:03;"They were just (beep) with you, man."
44:03;44:04;"- Yeah, it felt like they're--"
44:04;44:08;"- I mean, I guess they figure that's the game that you play"
44:08;44:11;"because maybe they interpret Seinfeld 2000"
44:11;44:13;"as being kind of, you know,"
44:13;44:17;"having that kind of detached meme,"
44:17;44:19;"nothing is sacred kind of vibe,"
44:19;44:21;"but they don't know that there's a real flesh and blood"
44:21;44:23;"human behind there who is actually looking"
44:23;44:26;"to try what sounds like a pretty cool vodka."
44:26;44:29;"- Yeah, I was stoked, but I think you nailed it."
44:29;44:33;"Listen, you put the memes in the feed."
44:33;44:37;"When you're DMing someone else behind the scenes,"
44:37;44:38;"that's when the memes stop"
44:38;44:40;"and you're just two people interacting."
44:40;44:42;"And for them to come back at you"
44:42;44:43;"with this kind of detached,"
44:43;44:45;"why don't you drive to your nearest computer"
44:45;44:48;"and feel like, you know what, shut the (beep) up."
44:48;44:49;"- Exactly."
44:49;44:53;"- This is just a guy standing in front of another guy,"
44:53;44:57;"another Vassar grad, asking for some free vodka."
44:57;44:58;"- Grad to grad."
44:58;44:59;"- Grad to grad."
44:59;45:01;"They could have written back like,"
45:01;45:03;"oh, hey, listen, big fan of the account,"
45:03;45:06;"but actually we're not giving out anymore,"
45:06;45:07;"but I'd love to direct you this way"
45:07;45:08;"'cause honestly it's pretty good."
45:08;45:09;"You should try it, dude."
45:09;45:11;"No, instead they wanted to have a bit of fun."
45:11;45:16;"- You know, with Arby's being a major joke in Seinfeld too,"
45:16;45:18;"with the character David Putty often suggesting"
45:18;45:21;"that they go to Arby's for dinner,"
45:21;45:22;"it feels like an Arby's night."
45:22;45:26;"You'd think that an enterprising social media manager"
45:26;45:29;"might say, oh, there's some mean potential here,"
45:29;45:31;"but you know what?"
45:31;45:32;"You blew it, Arby's."
45:32;45:34;"- Arby's has now become an enemy of the show."
45:34;45:36;"- Straight up."
45:36;45:38;"Let's get nihilist Arby's back."
45:38;45:40;"- Yeah, we still like nihilist Arby's."
45:40;45:43;"I mean, now Arby's is nihilist Arby's."
45:43;45:44;"That's the singularity."
45:44;45:48;"It's out here making vodka, (beep) with Seinfeld in the DMs."

46:48;46:50;"But what about Corona?"
46:50;46:53;"Corona's got something a little bit bigger than all those."
46:53;46:54;"- They've got a global pandemic."
46:54;46:57;"- In the middle of a, they got a global pandemic."
46:57;47:02;"But for people who forgot, Corona is a beer."
47:02;47:06;"And they just announced that they've got their own island."
47:06;47:07;"It's called Corona Island."
47:07;47:10;"And it's a unique destination for visitors"
47:10;47:11;"to disconnect from the everyday"
47:11;47:14;"and reconnect with the natural world."
47:14;47:17;"(laughing)"
47:17;47:17;"I love that."
47:17;47:18;"Just like- - Very natural."
47:18;47:20;"- A beer company being like,"
47:20;47:23;"God, it's so (beep) up."
47:23;47:25;"People have lost touch with nature."
47:25;47:26;"They don't have a way to just go connect"
47:26;47:27;"with the natural world."
47:27;47:29;"Everything's about technology"
47:29;47:32;"through the weird filters of modernity."
47:32;47:35;"People need a branded beer island"
47:35;47:37;"to reconnect with the natural world."
47:37;47:40;"It's located in the Caribbean Sea."
47:40;47:42;"(laughing)"
47:42;47:43;"Heard of it?"
47:43;47:47;"And it's gonna open in the spring."
47:47;47:49;"The island's gonna open."
47:49;47:51;"And they're hoping to receive a blue verified mark"
47:51;47:54;"from NGO Oceanic Global."
47:54;47:56;"I don't know anything about this NGO"
47:56;47:57;"and I don't mean to throw them under the bus,"
47:57;48:01;"but there is a giant worldwide scam"
48:01;48:06;"where people start NGOs just to verify corporate stuff."
48:06;48:09;"We could start some sort of NGO right now"
48:09;48:12;"that's like Time Crisis Global and be like,"
48:12;48:16;"yeah, we give everybody a golden seal"
48:16;48:18;"if their company is ethically in line"
48:18;48:23;"with the treatment of animals and the global supply chain."
48:23;48:24;"Like there is all this weird stuff"
48:24;48:27;"where it sounds like super official,"
48:27;48:31;"but for all we know, they basically bought it or something."
48:31;48:33;"But let's be open-minded."
48:33;48:35;"Maybe Oceanic Global's one of the good ones"
48:35;48:37;"and they're just making sure that Corona Island"
48:37;48:40;"is really taking care of how they use plastic"
48:40;48:42;"and how they deal with waste and things like that."
48:42;48:46;"- Felipe Ambra, the global vice president for Corona said,"
48:46;48:48;"""Corona Island is unlike anything we've ever done before."
48:48;48:51;"As a brand that's so deeply connected with nature."""
48:51;48:53;"- How are you connected with nature?"
48:53;48:55;"'Cause the ads have people on a beach,"
48:55;48:59;"which is presumably like adjacent to like a huge hotel."
48:59;49:00;"- Yeah, when I see those Corona ads,"
49:00;49:02;"I'm never picturing these people"
49:02;49:06;"just like backpacking on a deserted island."
49:06;49:07;"They're always sitting in beach chairs."
49:07;49:08;"- And you have ice cold beer,"
49:08;49:11;"which requires like multiple fridges."
49:11;49:12;"- Right."
49:12;49:15;"- So connected to nature's."
49:15;49:17;"- I mean, all beer is connected to nature."
49:17;49:19;"- This makes me think there needs to be"
49:19;49:21;"a Mountain Bruce song called Beach Bruce."
49:21;49:22;"- Oh yeah."
49:22;49:23;"Wait, that's actually,"
49:23;49:25;"I mean, when you do the full Jimmy Buffet thing,"
49:25;49:27;"that's Beach Bruce. - Oh, for sure."
49:27;49:28;"Beach Bruce."
49:28;49:30;"Beach Bruce is almost like a side project."
49:30;49:33;"(laughing)"
49:33;49:34;"- Love that."
49:34;49:37;"- I wanna say this sounded very familiar."
49:37;49:41;"I just wanna say, as we talked about this Corona Nation"
49:41;49:43;"or Corona Island, I was like, God, I feel like I,"
49:43;49:44;"this sounds so familiar."
49:44;49:47;"And I remember a story that I actually heard"
49:47;49:49;"on This American Life years ago,"
49:49;49:51;"which is about Cuervo Nation"
49:51;49:55;"and that Cuervo Tequila bought an island."
49:55;49:56;"- Whoa. - And the story,"
49:56;49:59;"yeah, and the story at the time is a very funny story,"
49:59;50:01;"but it was that there's a guy, Cuervo Man,"
50:01;50:05;"who was basically a dude who was the mascot"
50:05;50:08;"of Cuervo Nation, who just had to be drunk all the time."
50:08;50:09;"And it was like- - Oh God."
50:09;50:11;"- Yeah, it's actually a good story."
50:11;50:13;"John Hodgman is the one who does that, This American Life."
50:13;50:16;"But I'm looking it up now and Cuervo Nation is a tiny,"
50:16;50:19;"this is from 2005, Cuervo Nation,"
50:19;50:21;"a tiny eight acre island located in the Caribbean"
50:21;50:25;"just off of Tortola was founded in 1996 by Cuervo Tequila"
50:25;50:28;"as a haven for refugees from quote, political correctness."
50:28;50:32;"The tiny island nation guaranteed citizens 21 and older"
50:32;50:35;"the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of a good time."
50:35;50:37;"- Wait, so what happened? - Is it still going?"
50:37;50:38;"It's 25 years old now?"
50:38;50:39;"- It can't be."
50:39;50:43;"I mean, this is where I'll do some digging, but."
50:43;50:46;"(laughing)"
50:46;50:49;"- Either it's a thriving community,"
50:49;50:52;"they got totally cut off from the rest of the world."
50:52;50:55;"There is a population severely inbred,"
50:55;50:57;"but they're doing okay."
50:57;51:02;"And they kind of speak a mixture of English, Spanish,"
51:02;51:05;"and there's some loan words."
51:05;51:06;"It's unclear where they came from."
51:06;51:08;"It's very hard for anybody to understand."
51:08;51:10;"They basically have their own dialect at this point."
51:10;51:12;"- So it does not look like it's still around."
51:12;51:14;"It says in the early 2000s."
51:14;51:17;"So it's actually Marina Cay Island."
51:17;51:19;"It has a pretty interesting history,"
51:19;51:22;"but in the early 2000s, Jose Cuervo leased the island"
51:22;51:23;"referring it to as Cuervo Nation."
51:23;51:26;"The island was used as a promotional tool."
51:26;51:30;"Today it's the home of Pusser's Restaurant"
51:30;51:31;"and Villa Rentals."
51:31;51:34;"- There's some messed up islands in the Caribbean, man."
51:34;51:37;"(laughing)"
51:37;51:40;"- Yeah, the Caribbean has a lot of weird private islands."
51:40;51:42;"I mean, you always hear about Mystique."
51:42;51:47;"That's the Mick Jagger Island, which basically is private."
51:47;51:49;"- Of course, yeah, famously there's Little St. James."
51:49;51:52;"- Oh yeah, Epstein Island."
51:52;51:54;"Now you got Corona Island."
51:54;51:56;"Wait, is Corona Island Little St. James?"
51:56;51:57;"- Yeah."
51:57;51:58;"- I was actually just wondering."
51:58;52:01;"- Corona acquired a 10-year lease from the Epstein Estate."
52:01;52:03;"- Came with planes."
52:03;52:06;"- Corona got it for dirt cheap in a CIA auction."
52:06;52:09;"(laughing)"
52:09;52:11;"- Well, I was kind of, actually, as we've been talking about,"
52:11;52:14;"I was kind of wondering, what's the backstory on this island?"
52:14;52:15;"I guess maybe they didn't wanna,"
52:15;52:17;"does the press release say anything"
52:17;52:20;"about what this island was called before?"
52:20;52:22;"What's the history?"
52:22;52:24;"Are there indigenous people on Corona Island?"
52:24;52:26;"- So it's basically you go there,"
52:26;52:28;"you stay in a crappy hotel, you eat nachos,"
52:28;52:30;"you drink Corona."
52:30;52:31;"I mean, it sounds cool."
52:31;52:32;"- Could be worse."
52:32;52:33;"- Yeah."
52:33;52:34;"- What was the island called before Corona Island"
52:34;52:35;"and how did they acquire it?"
52:35;52:37;"That's the most interesting part."
52:37;52:40;"Did they buy it off of an impoverished nation?"
52:40;52:45;"Was it in some sort of weird international law limbo?"
52:45;52:48;"Does Corona have their own kind of like Navy?"
52:48;52:52;"- Yeah, it's like under what nation's laws is it operating?"
52:52;52:54;"- Yeah, is it a sovereign nation?"
52:54;52:56;"- Is there a police force?"
52:56;52:58;"- The Hells Angels are doing security."
52:58;53:00;"- Are there just like hundreds of islands in the Caribbean"
53:00;53:02;"that are just like kind of sitting there?"
53:02;53:03;"- Probably."
53:03;53:05;"I gotta say the SEO on this is terrible"
53:05;53:08;"because anytime you type in Corona Island,"
53:08;53:11;"it just talks about coronavirus on the island."
53:11;53:16;"It does seem to be close to--"
53:16;53:18;"- Corona's had a rough run."
53:18;53:19;"- You know?"
53:19;53:24;"Yeah, it seems to be off the coast of Columbia."
53:24;53:26;"But the press release--"
53:26;53:28;"- Okay, but it's not part of Columbia?"
53:28;53:29;"- Unclear."
53:29;53:32;"But the press release is really burying"
53:32;53:35;"any sort of like previous historic information."
53:35;53:37;"It seems like they just want you to feel like"
53:37;53:40;"this just wasn't on the map before."
53:40;53:41;"- Yeah, come on."
53:41;53:42;"Come on, guys."
53:42;53:44;"What's the real story?"
53:44;53:46;"I just love this, just like,"
53:46;53:49;"New Island just dropped Corona Island."
53:49;53:51;"We're about to open a new island."
53:51;53:53;"Oh, there's a new island opening?"
53:53;53:55;"Great."
53:55;53:55;"- Sick."
53:55;54:00;"But obviously they didn't build all the infrastructure."
54:00;54:03;"They didn't put in plumbing."
54:03;54:04;"- I mean, did they?"
54:04;54:07;"I mean, I'm sure there's still some empty islands."
54:07;54:10;"- There was some resort that went out of business"
54:10;54:14;"and they bought it for pennies on the dollar."
54:14;54:16;"- Yeah, and it's just part of Columbia or something."
54:16;54:17;"It's not a sovereign nation."
54:17;54:18;"I guess they're not--"
54:18;54:20;"(laughing)"
54:20;54:22;"They're not claiming it's a sovereign nation."
54:22;54:25;"- Sorry, their tagline is,"
54:25;54:29;"""Only a beer like this could create a place like this."""
54:29;54:30;"- Oh, like a very--"
54:30;54:32;"- It really does."
54:32;54:36;"- A very normal middling Mexican lager."
54:36;54:38;"There's like nine other beers exactly like it."
54:38;54:43;"- Wow, did you see this part?"
54:43;54:45;"Corona is plotting a number of activities"
54:45;54:49;"promoting conscious consumption once the island is open."
54:49;54:52;"Those may include workshops around living without plastic"
54:52;54:57;"and guided meditations set to natural island sounds."
54:57;54:57;"- Okay."
54:57;55:02;"I love that meditation and beer combination."
55:02;55:04;"(laughing)"
55:04;55:09;"- Meditation and beer."
55:09;55:10;"- Also, it's easy for Corona."
55:10;55:13;"It's like they don't package their beer in plastic."
55:13;55:15;"So it's like it's aluminum and glass."
55:15;55:17;"So it's like, yeah, let's put it in plastic."
55:17;55:20;"- Am I tripping or just sometimes people say"
55:20;55:23;"that packaging and shipping stuff in glass"
55:23;55:25;"is actually bad news."
55:25;55:25;"I feel like I've heard that 'cause glass is heavy."
55:26;55:27;"- It's all bad news."
55:27;55:29;"Yeah, I mean, what, you know."
55:29;55:33;"Transporting liquid, you know, it's all heavy."
55:33;55:35;"- You should be making your own beer at home."
55:35;55:38;"You should drink local lagers from the tap."
55:38;55:39;"- Yeah, local."
55:39;55:43;"- You should go be walking to your local brewery"
55:43;55:46;"with a growler, fill up the growler,"
55:46;55:50;"take it home, drink it up and bring it back."
55:50;55:53;"There's no reason why your average household of four"
55:53;55:57;"or five needs more than one glass growler."
55:57;56:00;"You come home, you drink out of the growler and that's it."
56:00;56:02;"- Beer is not a grocery item."
56:02;56:04;"(laughing)"
56:04;56:06;"- Beer is not a grocery item."
56:06;56:10;"There's an auction hosted by Charity Buzz,"
56:10;56:13;"which sounds very fake and dystopian,"
56:13;56:14;"but check it out."
56:14;56:16;"Check out the Corona."
56:16;56:17;"(laughing)"
56:17;56:18;"Oh man."
56:18;56:22;"Charity Buzz presents the Corona Island auction."
56:22;56:23;"Just too perfect."
56:23;56:26;"Anyway, one grand prize winner and nine guests"
56:26;56:29;"will win an all expensive paid week long"
56:29;56:31;"private island stay next year."
56:31;56:33;"So I wonder, so when they say private island,"
56:33;56:35;"does that mean this is a private island"
56:35;56:39;"or merely that you will have the island to yourself?"
56:39;56:40;"'Cause private island implies"
56:40;56:42;"that it's not part of a nation."
56:42;56:44;"- I think you're staying on the Corona Island"
56:44;56:47;"with nine friends and it's just you."
56:47;56:48;"- Right, so it's not a private island"
56:48;56:50;"in the way that sometimes you hear about"
56:50;56:53;"some billionaire owns their own island."
56:53;56:56;"I mean, look, I'd love to know more about Corona Island."
56:56;56:58;"I wanna know the history of it."
56:58;57:01;"Just to start with, where did this island come from?"
57:01;57:04;"- Yeah, they're being very, very, very secretive"
57:04;57:06;"about what it used to be."
57:06;57:07;"- Little St. James."
57:07;57:09;"(laughing)"
57:09;57:11;"- It literally might be."
57:11;57:11;"Okay, if we have any--"
57:11;57:13;"- That would be so funny."
57:13;57:15;"(laughing)"
57:15;57:20;"- If we have any TC heads who like to sail,"
57:20;57:23;"maybe a pirate, maybe a cartographer,"
57:23;57:26;"anybody who really knows the Caribbean well"
57:26;57:28;"and who knows which islands they're spoken for,"
57:28;57:29;"if you can find us anything"
57:29;57:31;"about the real history of Corona Island,"
57:31;57:33;"just like where did this come from?"
57:33;57:35;"What was the transaction?"
57:35;57:36;"Anyway, let us know."

01:01:02;01:01:04;"I can't really tell,"
01:01:04;01:01:09;"is Get Back like really taking over your world, Jake?"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"I feel like I've got a lot of people hitting me up"
01:01:11;01:01:14;"being like, you watch and Get Back, this is crazy."
01:01:14;01:01:16;"All the musicians love it."
01:01:16;01:01:20;"- If I look at Twitter, it's definitely like 60% Get Back,"
01:01:20;01:01:21;"which I love."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"- Yeah."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"- I'd rather have that than dumb politics."
01:01:24;01:01:27;"And we watched over Thanksgiving weekend."
01:01:27;01:01:28;"- You said you're gonna gather around"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"the whole Longstreth clan to watch."
01:01:30;01:01:33;"- We did, we watched about three and a half hours,"
01:01:33;01:01:38;"like an episode and a half as a family, which was great."
01:01:38;01:01:41;"A lot of fun, even though I honestly think"
01:01:41;01:01:44;"they could have cut quite a bit out."
01:01:44;01:01:45;"I really enjoyed it."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"I didn't think every episode needed to be"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"two hours and 50 minutes."
01:01:48;01:01:52;"I feel like they could have been two hours 15 maybe,"
01:01:52;01:01:54;"but there was so much of them just like schlepping gear"
01:01:54;01:01:58;"around and trying to plug in monitor speakers."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"It's just a lot of stuff."
01:01:59;01:02:00;"It's just like, I don't, you know,"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"I loved them arranging the songs"
01:02:02;01:02:05;"and writing the songs together and playing the songs."
01:02:05;01:02:07;"And I liked some of the banter, but anyway,"
01:02:07;01:02:12;"I finished the whole, the last one and a half episodes"
01:02:12;01:02:14;"in the last few days at home."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"But yes, it's been in my life big time last week."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"What about you?"
01:02:17;01:02:18;"- I still haven't watched the whole show."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"I think I mentioned on the program"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"that I saw a little preview."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"- Yeah."
01:02:23;01:02:24;"- Of the premiere, but they,"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"that was kind of like bits and pieces."
01:02:26;01:02:27;"So I feel like I've seen a lot of it"
01:02:27;01:02:30;"and I started watching the program."
01:02:30;01:02:32;"Yeah, obviously you could talk forever about, you know,"
01:02:32;01:02:35;"it's just cool seeing them be regular people"
01:02:35;01:02:36;"and seeing the songs come together."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"It's pretty fascinating."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"One thing that's made me think about"
01:02:40;01:02:43;"is just the album, ""Let It Be,"" period."
01:02:43;01:02:45;"'Cause obviously this, in this era,"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"they're doing some songs that ended up on Abbey Road,"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"but these, most of what you're seeing"
01:02:49;01:02:52;"are the songs that became the album, ""Let It Be."""
01:02:52;01:02:56;"And it made me, I'm sure like a lot of people,"
01:02:56;01:02:57;"read up a little more on ""Let It Be."""
01:02:57;01:03:00;"There was a copy of it in my house growing up"
01:03:00;01:03:03;"when I think probably my mom had it."
01:03:03;01:03:04;"And I'd always throw it on."
01:03:04;01:03:07;"I do remember as a kid being like pretty,"
01:03:07;01:03:10;"like kind of depressed by ""The Long and Winding Road."""
01:03:10;01:03:11;"Not that it's a bad song."
01:03:11;01:03:14;"I appreciate it more as I'm, now that I'm older,"
01:03:14;01:03:16;"but I knew that that was, had been a single"
01:03:16;01:03:19;"and it's just like those Phil Spector arrangements."
01:03:19;01:03:22;"It's just, that's just like a sad, weird song."
01:03:22;01:03:23;"- Yeah, even the song itself, I think,"
01:03:23;01:03:28;"might be the schmaltziest non-tongue-in-cheek parody song"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"that the Beatles did."
01:03:30;01:03:33;"- I think I'd probably more people would like that song."
01:03:33;01:03:37;"It's obviously well-written in the sense"
01:03:37;01:03:39;"that it's like very functionally, it works."
01:03:39;01:03:41;"But I could picture if they had done it"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"like really stripped down, like no drums,"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"just like a yesterday style,"
01:03:45;01:03:49;"just like string arrangement, acoustic, Paul."
01:03:49;01:03:53;"♪ The long and winding road that leads me ♪"
01:03:53;01:03:54;"There's something about the drums."

01:03:56;01:03:57;"- Yeah."
01:03:57;01:04:01;"- It's like they're ""Touch Me"" by The Doors, which I like."
01:04:01;01:04:02;"- Yeah. - But anyway, yeah."
01:04:02;01:04:04;"I was thinking just about that album in general."
01:04:04;01:04:08;"Like was that an album that you spent much time with, Jake?"
01:04:08;01:04:09;"""Let It Be."""
01:04:09;01:04:12;"Can you name the opening three tracks on ""Let It Be""?"
01:04:12;01:04:16;"- ""Two of Us,"" ""I Dig a Pony,"" and ""Across the Universe."""
01:04:16;01:04:17;"- Oh, okay."
01:04:17;01:04:17;"All right."
01:04:17;01:04:18;"- I know the record."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"I mean, I know all the Beatles records,"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"but like, yeah, I didn't,"
01:04:21;01:04:24;"it's never been a real go-to for me."
01:04:24;01:04:25;"I love a lot of the songs on there."
01:04:25;01:04:28;"I never, and I still didn't quite grasp this"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"from watching the six-hour documentary."
01:04:30;01:04:34;"I never understood what was the hurry?"
01:04:34;01:04:38;"Like why do they have to be done by the last day of January?"
01:04:38;01:04:40;"Like why couldn't they just keep working on this record?"
01:04:40;01:04:42;"- Is it 'cause Ringo had to go back"
01:04:42;01:04:44;"to shooting ""The Magic Christian,"""
01:04:44;01:04:46;"the film that he was acting in?"
01:04:46;01:04:47;"- Oh, wait."
01:04:47;01:04:49;"I mean, they do say something"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"about how they need the stage back for this movie"
01:04:51;01:04:54;"that Apple Films, the Beatles company, was producing"
01:04:54;01:04:55;"called ""The Magic Christian."""
01:04:55;01:04:57;"- Yeah, but they moved out of there."
01:04:57;01:04:59;"- I guess Ringo was gonna be busy, though."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"Yeah, it's a little bit unclear."
01:05:00;01:05:02;"And in the trailer, that's how they set it up."
01:05:02;01:05:05;"""The Beatles have 30 days to record an album."""
01:05:05;01:05:06;"I know what you mean."
01:05:06;01:05:07;"It's like, why?"
01:05:07;01:05:10;"- It's like, I mean, I love them waiting to the last minute"
01:05:10;01:05:11;"to write and record a record."
01:05:11;01:05:13;"That's hilarious."
01:05:13;01:05:15;"But yeah, they were in the like Twickenham"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"like soundstage for like two weeks,"
01:05:17;01:05:18;"and they were like, ""This sucks."""
01:05:18;01:05:20;"And then they moved to the studio,"
01:05:20;01:05:21;"and then Billy Preston comes in,"
01:05:21;01:05:23;"and then things really start cooking."
01:05:23;01:05:24;"- And they ended up shelving that album for a year anyway."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"- Yeah, and they're in a groove."
01:05:25;01:05:28;"They have like a great two weeks,"
01:05:28;01:05:29;"and then it's like, ""We're done."""
01:05:29;01:05:31;"And it's sort of like, ""Okay, well, what?"
01:05:31;01:05:33;"""Ringo's gonna go film a movie for three weeks,"
01:05:33;01:05:35;"""and you couldn't just pick it up in February?"""
01:05:35;01:05:36;"I don't understand."
01:05:36;01:05:38;"I never understood what the crisis was."
01:05:38;01:05:41;"I guess they were trying to make a television production."
01:05:41;01:05:42;"I don't know."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"- Yeah, I think that might've been an element of it."
01:05:44;01:05:46;"And maybe even back then,"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"we kind of take it for granted"
01:05:48;01:05:51;"how much the record industry has changed in some ways."
01:05:51;01:05:54;"And I'm sure some people would argue it hasn't in many."
01:05:54;01:05:57;"But it's also possible that we look back"
01:05:57;01:06:00;"and say the Beatles were the biggest artists on earth."
01:06:00;01:06:01;"They could have taken seven years"
01:06:01;01:06:03;"to make an album if they wanted to."
01:06:03;01:06:06;"But maybe even back then, they're still relatively young,"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"and maybe they still did feel a little bit"
01:06:08;01:06:09;"like oppressed by the label."
01:06:09;01:06:12;"Maybe EMI was like, ""Guys, we need the record."""
01:06:12;01:06:14;"And even then, the Beatles,"
01:06:14;01:06:16;"the biggest artists in the world were a little bit like,"
01:06:16;01:06:17;"""Oh God, all right."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"""Oh, I don't wanna get in trouble with EMI."""
01:06:19;01:06:22;"- They seemed naive to their own power."
01:06:22;01:06:23;"- There is a part where they're talking about,"
01:06:23;01:06:26;"""Why won't EMI give us the eight track?"""
01:06:26;01:06:28;"And they're like, ""I heard they gave it to the Beach Boys."""
01:06:28;01:06:31;"And then George is like, ""All right, you can use my eight track."""
01:06:31;01:06:35;"I guess just today, if it was Billie Eilish or something,"
01:06:35;01:06:37;"it wouldn't even be a conversation."
01:06:37;01:06:39;"Her manager would just be yelling at somebody."
01:06:39;01:06:42;"- So then we get 45 minutes of them moving in"
01:06:42;01:06:43;"George Harrison's eight track,"
01:06:43;01:06:46;"and Glenn John's trying to get it hooked in."
01:06:46;01:06:47;"But yeah, you're totally right."
01:06:47;01:06:51;"It's sort of like, I was shocked by the lack"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"of professional infrastructure around the band."
01:06:53;01:06:56;"Did they even have a manager?"
01:06:56;01:06:57;"Obviously, there's this stuff"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"about Brian Epstein dying in 1966."
01:06:59;01:07:02;"- Well, so he was dead, and then famously,"
01:07:02;01:07:06;"their new manager, Alan Klein, was very controversial,"
01:07:06;01:07:07;"and that's partially why Paul left,"
01:07:07;01:07:09;"'cause some of the guys liked him and some didn't."
01:07:09;01:07:12;"So maybe this was a weird time for them."
01:07:12;01:07:13;"- No, no, but here's the thing."
01:07:13;01:07:14;"You haven't seen part three yet."
01:07:14;01:07:18;"In part three, they meet Alan Klein for the very first time."
01:07:18;01:07:21;"John Lennon has a real late night."
01:07:21;01:07:22;"I think they didn't have a--"
01:07:22;01:07:23;"- Were they self-managed in this era?"
01:07:23;01:07:26;"- I got the sense that there's no manager at all."
01:07:26;01:07:28;"- That's why you need a good manager."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"Without a good manager, you got George Harrison"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"having to bring his eight track from home."
01:07:32;01:07:36;"- Yeah, they seemed, without a manager to help them"
01:07:36;01:07:40;"through this kind of morass of,"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"do we make a TV show, do we play a show?"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"Also, the fact, I love that they did the rooftop show."
01:07:44;01:07:46;"I mean, the footage is great."
01:07:46;01:07:49;"It's a really cool, surprising thing to do,"
01:07:49;01:07:52;"but it is funny that they are thinking about playing a show,"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"and they're like, we can't find a venue."
01:07:54;01:07:56;"It's the Beatles."
01:07:56;01:07:58;"They couldn't find a venue in London."
01:07:58;01:08:00;"I was just like, what is happening?"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"And there's even a bit of Peter Jackson text that comes up,"
01:08:02;01:08:05;"and they're like, no venues were available"
01:08:05;01:08:07;"in the next three days, or something like that."
01:08:07;01:08:09;"And it's sort of like, how is that possible?"
01:08:09;01:08:10;"- And also, it seems like,"
01:08:10;01:08:13;"because there was a studio at Apple,"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"it seems much easier than schlepping everything"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"to a venue, at least they could just run the cables down"

01:10:03;01:10:08;"you go to Hayton Ashbury, and it's like a huge Gap store,"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"and like a Ben and Jerry's, and like a T-Mobile."
01:10:10;01:10:12;"It's just like, oh, hell yeah."

01:10:19;01:10:21;"but I also feel like in a weird way,"
01:10:21;01:10:24;"I would say basically every Beatles song is good,"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"or has something worthwhile about it."
01:10:26;01:10:28;"But I do feel like in a way,"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"watching them work on it has probably given people"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"more appreciation for some of these songs."
01:10:32;01:10:33;"Like, I feel like there's this,"
01:10:33;01:10:37;"like such a renewed love of track one, Two of Us."
01:10:37;01:10:39;"I just feel like I'm hearing more people being like,"
01:10:39;01:10:42;"Two of Us, man, it's one of McCartney's best songs."
01:10:43;01:10:44;"- Two of Us, that's an all-time record."
01:10:44;01:10:46;"- I would not go that far, yeah."
01:10:46;01:10:48;"I know what you mean, 'cause I, yeah,"
01:10:48;01:10:50;"I was never a big fan of I've Got a Feelin',"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"and I've never been a big fan of Two of Us."
01:10:52;01:10:53;"They're fine."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"- They come across much better now."
01:10:54;01:10:56;"- Totally. - Post Get Back."
01:10:56;01:10:59;"So I think this whole thing was just about putting Two of Us"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"and I've Got a Feelin' more on the map."

01:12:15;01:12:17;"when I would think back to being like 12,"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"I would listen to it and I'd be like,"
01:12:19;01:12:24;"""Across the universe, let it be Get Back, I'm out."""
01:12:24;01:12:27;"That was my like, kind of like brash, like kid take on it."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"- Right."
01:12:28;01:12:30;"- I thought everything else was okay."
01:12:30;01:12:33;"Like one after 9/09, I couldn't make heads or tails of that"
01:12:33;01:12:36;"as a young person. - Bad, not good."
01:12:36;01:12:38;"- To be fair, that's their jam flow, man."
01:12:38;01:12:40;"They wrote that as teenagers. - For sure."
01:12:40;01:12:43;"- And it is kind of like sums up their,"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"you know, their kind of like influences and stuff."
01:12:45;01:12:46;"I don't think it's bad."
01:12:46;01:12:47;"It's just like, I just,"
01:12:47;01:12:49;"I didn't have the cultural context to realize,"
01:12:49;01:12:52;"okay, this is the Beatles in the last year"
01:12:52;01:12:53;"of their existence."
01:12:53;01:12:55;"And this is them doing a throwback"
01:12:55;01:12:58;"to what they were doing before they were even a real band."
01:12:58;01:12:59;"- Right."
01:12:59;01:13:00;"- Riffing on like the early rock and roll."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"They like, I couldn't look at it that way."
01:13:02;01:13:03;"Now I understand it more and that gives me more."
01:13:03;01:13:04;"- Right."
01:13:04;01:13:05;"- Yeah, now I understand it."
01:13:05;01:13:07;"And then like Maggie Mae,"
01:13:07;01:13:10;"that's, they're just saying like a Liverpool"
01:13:10;01:13:11;"kind of like folk song."
01:13:11;01:13:13;"I mean mine, dig it."
01:13:13;01:13:15;"Yeah, I didn't have much appreciation for those songs."
01:13:15;01:13:17;"Yeah, it was really those three stood out to me."
01:13:17;01:13:20;"Across the Universe, All Time."
01:13:20;01:13:22;"That's like a top five Beatles song to me."
01:13:22;01:13:23;"- Really?"
01:13:23;01:13:23;"Wow."
01:13:23;01:13:24;"- Or top 10."
01:13:24;01:13:27;"- I don't think it would be in my top 40."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"- Really?"
01:13:28;01:13:29;"- I don't think so."
01:13:29;01:13:31;"But like from this period, I love,"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"the two John Lennon songs are my favorite."
01:13:33;01:13:36;"The Don't Let Me Down and Dig a Pony."
01:13:36;01:13:38;"- Well yeah, but Don't Let Me Down is not on Let It Be."
01:13:38;01:13:39;"- I know."
01:13:39;01:13:41;"This came up last episode."
01:13:41;01:13:42;"I remember you thought it was on Abbey Road."
01:13:42;01:13:43;"- Oh right, yeah, yeah."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"- I was like, no bro, it was a single."
01:13:44;01:13:45;"- It's a B-side."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"- Which is insane."
01:13:47;01:13:50;"Don't Let Me Down, yeah."
01:13:50;01:13:52;"The footage of them working out all those parts"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"with Billy Preston, that was super cool."
01:13:54;01:13:54;"- Yeah."
01:13:54;01:13:56;"- As a lifelong Don't Let Me Down head."
01:13:56;01:13:58;"- I only wish that we could have had this footage"
01:13:58;01:13:59;"for all the Beatles albums."
01:13:59;01:14:01;"- Totally."

01:15:11;01:15:13;"- One funny thing, being in London,"
01:15:13;01:15:18;"I went to an interesting talk at Abbey Road Studios recently."
01:15:18;01:15:20;"- Wow."
01:15:20;01:15:25;"- These two kind of legendary in the Beatles community guys,"
01:15:25;01:15:28;"Kevin L. Ryan and Brian Keehoo,"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"they wrote this book called Recording the Beatles."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"Are you aware of this?"
01:15:31;01:15:32;"- No, I'm not."
01:15:32;01:15:37;"- So it's this like massive book that came out in 2006."
01:15:37;01:15:39;"And so these guys, Kevin and Brian,"
01:15:39;01:15:43;"are kind of like, my understanding is that they were both"
01:15:43;01:15:46;"two like all time obsessive gearheads,"
01:15:46;01:15:49;"but also like really diligent researchers."
01:15:49;01:15:52;"And they were both trying to like go super deep on like,"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"what did the Beatles record with?"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"'Cause you know, it's like one thing to be like,"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"John played a Gibson on that, or you know,"
01:15:58;01:16:01;"Ringo had a, on that one they're using like a slinger lens set"
01:16:01;01:16:03;"or you know, whatever, there's that stuff."
01:16:03;01:16:05;"But to really get into like the nitty gritty of like,"
01:16:05;01:16:06;"what was the chain?"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"Like, what was the mic?"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"What kind of cable connected the mic to the preamp?"
01:16:10;01:16:11;"All that stuff."
01:16:11;01:16:12;"- Wow."
01:16:12;01:16:14;"- Nobody had ever really done an in-depth thing."
01:16:14;01:16:17;"And my understanding is that they're basically two guys,"
01:16:17;01:16:18;"15, 20 years ago,"
01:16:18;01:16:21;"who were both like showing up at these old school studios,"
01:16:21;01:16:22;"like Abbey Road and just being like,"
01:16:22;01:16:24;"finding anybody who used to work there to ask them questions"
01:16:24;01:16:27;"about like, was that plugged directly into the board?"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"You know, like really deep questions."
01:16:29;01:16:30;"And then somebody was like, you know,"
01:16:30;01:16:32;"there's another guy asking all these questions."
01:16:32;01:16:34;"This is almost like some Zodiac type (beep)"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"just like, you know, there's somebody else on the case."
01:16:36;01:16:38;"You guys should meet each other."
01:16:38;01:16:40;"And then there were these two American guys"
01:16:40;01:16:41;"and they met each other and they were like, wow."
01:16:41;01:16:42;"- Let's team up."
01:16:43;01:16:44;"And they teamed up and they wrote this book"
01:16:44;01:16:48;"that's kind of legendary with producers"
01:16:48;01:16:49;"called Recording the Beatles."
01:16:49;01:16:52;"And I think the first edition sold out like immediately"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"and they're working on a follow-up."
01:16:54;01:16:56;"Anyway, they were giving a talk at Abbey Road"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"and it was kind of just about the whole history"
01:16:58;01:16:59;"of the studio."
01:16:59;01:17:02;"And it was cool 'cause you got to sit in studio two,"
01:17:02;01:17:05;"which is the room the Beatles used a lot."
01:17:05;01:17:08;"And they like brought out some of the old pianos they used."
01:17:08;01:17:10;"They were playing some of them and like instantly you're like,"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"oh yeah, that's like the Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da piano."
01:17:12;01:17:15;"And Pink Floyd used a lot of the same gear"
01:17:15;01:17:17;"when they were working on Dark Side of the Moon."
01:17:17;01:17:22;"Like there's a Celesta that Pink Floyd used"
01:17:22;01:17:25;"and the Beatles used on multiple recordings."
01:17:25;01:17:27;"But a couple of things that stand out,"
01:17:27;01:17:28;"so they're just going through the whole history"
01:17:28;01:17:31;"and they're finding all this like footage and pictures."
01:17:31;01:17:33;"And there were these pictures of the Beatles"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"'cause when you watch Get Back and everybody's like,"
01:17:35;01:17:38;"oh, Yoko's hanging out, what's up with that?"
01:17:38;01:17:39;"That's bizarre."
01:17:39;01:17:41;"But then they were showing pictures of the Beatles"
01:17:41;01:17:46;"in like 64, 65 and there would always be a row of chairs,"
01:17:46;01:17:47;"almost like, I don't know,"
01:17:47;01:17:50;"almost like it was like basketball practice or something."
01:17:50;01:17:53;"They would always have their friends just sitting there."
01:17:53;01:17:56;"So that contextualized Get Back for me a little bit."
01:17:56;01:17:59;"They would always have a row of like seven chairs for friends"
01:17:59;01:18:02;"just to kind of come hang out and watch them record,"
01:18:02;01:18:05;"which maybe was less boring back in the day"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"'cause there'd be more like complete takes."
01:18:07;01:18:09;"Like today, if you just like came over"
01:18:09;01:18:11;"and watched somebody record,"
01:18:11;01:18:13;"you're kind of just like sitting in a room with them,"
01:18:13;01:18:16;"staring at a computer versus back then,"
01:18:16;01:18:17;"you'd probably be like,"
01:18:17;01:18:19;"if you listen to them do like 10 takes of something,"
01:18:19;01:18:21;"you might, and you're just like a friend"
01:18:21;01:18:22;"reading the newspaper or something,"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"you might just like peek your head out and be like,"
01:18:24;01:18:25;"that one was hot."
01:18:25;01:18:26;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:18:26;01:18:27;"- Nice Ringo."
01:18:27;01:18:28;"But yeah, I guess there was always this thing"
01:18:28;01:18:29;"of like in these big rooms,"
01:18:29;01:18:33;"there'd just be people lined up watching them."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"But anyway, seeing some of these glimpses,"
01:18:35;01:18:36;"I was like, oh man, it'd be so,"
01:18:36;01:18:39;"I wish I could see the Beatles like recording Revolver"
01:18:39;01:18:41;"or something."
01:18:41;01:18:43;"- Yeah, that would have been amazing."
01:18:43;01:18:45;"There was a book that I was really into"
01:18:45;01:18:48;"and my brother was really into called Revolution in the Head,"
01:18:48;01:18:51;"which came out in the 90s and was written by Ian McDonald,"
01:18:51;01:18:53;"who was a British guy."
01:18:53;01:18:55;"He was like a classical music writer mostly,"
01:18:55;01:18:58;"but he wrote a really great,"
01:18:58;01:19:03;"it's much more concise sounding than recording the Beatles,"
01:19:03;01:19:07;"but he goes through every song in chronological order"
01:19:07;01:19:11;"and gets pretty, doesn't get into like the cables and stuff"
01:19:11;01:19:12;"and like the preamps,"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"but gets deep into like,"
01:19:14;01:19:16;"just kind of like who was doing what"
01:19:16;01:19:19;"and like puts the songs into sort of like"
01:19:19;01:19:22;"their creative context in terms of their chronology."
01:19:22;01:19:25;"And anyway, for Beatles heads out there,"
01:19:25;01:19:27;"I return to it every now and then."
01:19:27;01:19:28;"It's a great book."
01:19:28;01:19:29;"- Yeah, I flipped through that."
01:19:29;01:19:30;"That is a great book."
01:19:30;01:19:33;"And I feel like as long as I've known you and Dave,"
01:19:33;01:19:34;"that's come up quite a bit."
01:19:34;01:19:36;"- Yeah, Dave has it."
01:19:36;01:19:37;"He had like,"
01:19:37;01:19:38;"it actually came up because we were watching Get Back"
01:19:38;01:19:40;"over Thanksgiving and Dave brought up"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"like an Ian McDonald quote."
01:19:42;01:19:44;"And I was like, do you have that on your phone?"
01:19:44;01:19:45;"He's like, oh yeah,"
01:19:45;01:19:47;"I have a PDF of Revolution in the Head"
01:19:47;01:19:50;"on my phone at all times."
01:19:50;01:19:52;"- In Dave's studio, there are three books,"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"The Holy Bible,"
01:19:54;01:19:57;"The Constitution of the United States of America"
01:19:57;01:19:59;"and Revolution in the Head by Ian McDonald."
01:19:59;01:20:00;"That's it."
01:20:00;01:20:05;"I've also heard with all this Beatles talk going on,"
01:20:05;01:20:08;"I've heard multiple people ask me"
01:20:08;01:20:10;"if I'd read Jeff Emmerich's book"
01:20:10;01:20:13;"and Jeff Emmerich worked with George Martin."
01:20:13;01:20:16;"He was like the long-time engineer of the Beatles."
01:20:16;01:20:18;"And apparently he wrote a pretty spicy book."
01:20:18;01:20:19;"- Oh really?"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"- And I was like, so what's the upshot in the Emmerich book?"
01:20:21;01:20:25;"And a lot of people said he only respected Paul."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"He gave Paul the props."
01:20:26;01:20:29;"He said, Paul's the one who like took the reins."
01:20:29;01:20:30;"Like people (beep) on Paul,"
01:20:30;01:20:32;"but he was like, he was the genius."
01:20:32;01:20:35;"- But like Jeff Emmerich was not in Get Back."
01:20:35;01:20:38;"I didn't remember seeing anyone referred to as Jeff Emmerich."
01:20:38;01:20:39;"- No, I don't."
01:20:39;01:20:40;"- I mean, George Martin seemed to be-"
01:20:40;01:20:41;"- Yeah, he might've been out by then."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"- George Martin even seemed to have"
01:20:43;01:20:46;"been taking sort of a backseat role in those sessions."
01:20:46;01:20:48;"- And ultimately I think Let It Be"
01:20:48;01:20:49;"is credited to Phil Spector."
01:20:49;01:20:50;"- Weird."
01:20:50;01:20:53;"- As the producer, and he's like, he's not there."
01:20:53;01:20:55;"I mean, he clearly, by today's standards,"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"he might've like mixed it"
01:20:57;01:20:59;"and he certainly added some string arrangements."

01:21:00;01:21:01;"I did notice them like,"

01:21:04;01:21:06;"like they would definitely defer to Paul"
01:21:06;01:21:08;"in terms of arrangement choices."
01:21:08;01:21:11;"Like what kind of like drum pattern should there be?"
01:21:11;01:21:13;"Or like, is this like, Paul would be like,"
01:21:13;01:21:17;"this is too plotting or this is too slow."
01:21:17;01:21:19;"Or like, he definitely was taking leadership"

01:21:31;01:21:32;"- John, he wasn't doing that."
01:21:32;01:21:33;"John would write songs."
01:21:33;01:21:35;"- Yeah, he seemed like he was a little bit checked out."
01:21:35;01:21:36;"- Yeah."
01:21:36;01:21:37;"- Well, yeah, and it's because of course"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"with the Beatles, people really get into just like,"
01:21:39;01:21:40;"well, who's your favorite?"
01:21:40;01:21:41;"Whose songs do you like?"
01:21:41;01:21:44;"And of course, when you look at it,"
01:21:44;01:21:46;"you realize, well, you know,"
01:21:46;01:21:49;"there's a lot of people helping each other with the songs,"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"people arranging each other's"
01:21:51;01:21:53;"and perhaps Paul taking the biggest lead on that front."
01:21:53;01:21:55;"Well, this week for the top five,"
01:21:55;01:21:58;"we're gonna do the top five Beatles songs."
01:21:58;01:22:01;"And these are just their five biggest songs"
01:22:01;01:22:02;"on the Billboard charts."
01:22:02;01:22:04;"I guess just in terms of like,"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"how long they were on the charts"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"or how high they reached."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"- Okay."
01:22:09;01:22:10;"- Can you off the top of your head,"
01:22:10;01:22:11;"just do your top five Beatles?"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"I feel like we did this years ago."
01:22:13;01:22:15;"- My favorite Beatles songs?"
01:22:15;01:22:16;"- Can you do it off the top of your head?"
01:22:16;01:22:17;"- No."
01:22:17;01:22:18;"- What are your top five,"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"just like not single Beatles songs?"
01:22:20;01:22:21;"What comes to mind?"
01:22:21;01:22:23;"- I thought about when we were texting the other day"
01:22:23;01:22:24;"about the show, I was like,"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"maybe we should each bring in our top five Beatles."
01:22:26;01:22:27;"We can do this another episode."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"- Top of head?"
01:22:28;01:22:29;"- Maybe we'll do another episode."
01:22:29;01:22:30;"- Top of head, I go."
01:22:30;01:22:32;"- Okay, you know, we'll save it."
01:22:32;01:22:33;"Let's just throw out one."
01:22:33;01:22:35;"Let's just throw out one Beatles deep cut"
01:22:35;01:22:36;"that you ride for hard,"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"that you feel like is unsung."
01:22:38;01:22:39;"- Well, I don't know if it's unsung,"
01:22:39;01:22:41;"but the first thought, best thought,"
01:22:41;01:22:43;"happiness is a warm gun."
01:22:43;01:22:44;"- Oh yeah, amazing song."
01:22:44;01:22:45;"- I mean, everyone loves that song,"
01:22:45;01:22:48;"but that's kind of, it's like not a hit single."
01:22:48;01:22:49;"- No, definitely not."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"And it's a strange song."
01:22:50;01:22:51;"- Yeah."
01:22:51;01:22:52;"- I always used to say that the White Album"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"was my favorite Beatles album."
01:22:54;01:22:55;"- Damn."
01:22:55;01:22:57;"- And that to me is like the epitome of,"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"of course I can understand, you know,"
01:22:59;01:23:01;"as we've spoken about the show,"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"White Album's not electable."
01:23:03;01:23:05;"Sergeant Peppers,"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"that's what's going to get the votes"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"on the greatest albums of all time."
01:23:08;01:23:10;"But I always felt like the White Album's my favorite"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"and not just because it's like long"
01:23:12;01:23:15;"and has more room for different weird ideas,"
01:23:15;01:23:17;"just like even just the songwriting,"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"it hit some kind of strange peak for me"
01:23:19;01:23:20;"and a song like, I totally agree,"
01:23:20;01:23:21;"happiness is a warm gun."
01:23:21;01:23:22;"It's so weird."

01:42:14;01:42:19;"while the guys are working out a harmony or a riff or something."

01:42:25;01:42:29;"but he's kind of there and he's watching very attentively."
01:42:29;01:42:33;"And he has a sense of focus and purpose"

01:43:37;01:43:38;"Look at the way they're looking at it."
01:43:38;01:43:41;"It's like as if it's proof of time travel."
01:43:41;01:43:44;"There's a whole universe of that kind of stuff."
01:43:44;01:43:45;"And you know what?"
01:43:45;01:43:46;"It might be real."
01:43:46;01:43:47;"That'd be sick."
01:43:47;01:43:48;"Yeah."
01:43:48;01:43:49;"Let's not rule it out."
01:43:49;01:43:50;"Just sort of like how in that Game of Thrones episode,"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"there was like a Starbucks cup like in the background by accident."
01:43:52;01:43:56;"If like Peter Jackson like accidentally put in like a Starbucks cup"
01:43:56;01:44:01;"or like purposefully put in like CGI Starbucks cup or like an iPhone,"
01:44:01;01:44:04;"like deep background and like one frame."
01:44:04;01:44:06;"A box of Tim Beibs."
01:44:06;01:44:08;"Everybody's like, wait a second."
01:44:08;01:44:09;"No, no, no."
01:44:09;01:44:12;"Tim Hortons did not announce Tim Beibs until 2021."
01:44:12;01:44:13;"It doesn't add up."
01:44:13;01:44:15;"It's like, all right, guys, hold on."
01:44:15;01:44:16;"They weren't Tim Beibs."
01:44:16;01:44:17;"They were just Timbits."
01:44:17;01:44:19;"All right, that makes sense."
01:44:19;01:44:22;"And then the number one biggest song that the Beatles ever had."
01:44:22;01:44:25;"This topped up Billboard Hot 100 for nine weeks"
01:44:25;01:44:27;"and stayed on the chart for 19 weeks."
01:44:27;01:44:29;"It's ""Hey Jude""."
01:44:29;01:44:32;"We've heard this a lot on Time Crisis."
01:44:32;01:44:34;"We've heard this a lot."
01:44:34;01:44:35;"I guess it makes sense."
01:44:35;01:44:38;"Now we know this is their biggest chart hit."
01:44:38;01:44:40;"Also just a single, not on a record."
01:44:40;01:44:41;"Yeah."
01:44:41;01:44:46;"Remember to let her into your heart."
01:44:46;01:44:52;"Then you can start to make it better."
01:44:52;01:44:53;"It was interesting."
01:44:53;01:44:54;"I don't know."
01:44:54;01:44:58;"I'm sure Jake, Get Back has also like sent you onto Wikipedia quite a bit."
01:44:58;01:45:03;"And looking at the Wikipedia for the album, ""Let It Be"","
01:45:03;01:45:07;"it's interesting to see ""Let It Be"" was not well received."
01:45:07;01:45:09;"The song or the album?"
01:45:09;01:45:10;"The album."
01:45:10;01:45:12;"It got like scathing reviews."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"I mean, the song was big, but..."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"Scathing."
01:45:16;01:45:17;"It got scathing."
01:45:17;01:45:20;"People were just like, what a dud for the Beatles to end on."
01:45:20;01:45:21;"This sucks."
01:45:21;01:45:24;"And even the song ""Let It Be"", which is now considered an all-time classic,"
01:45:24;01:45:29;"apparently a few journalists really compared it disfavorably to ""Hey Jude""."
01:45:29;01:45:30;"They're just like..."
01:45:30;01:45:31;"You can't win."
01:45:32;01:45:36;"I mean, yeah, it's like you write one of the most beautiful rock songs ever,"
01:45:36;01:45:40;"""Hey Jude"", one of the most era-defining hits."
01:45:40;01:45:44;"And then you write another beautiful song the next year,"
01:45:44;01:45:48;"and they're like, ""This is the phone-in version of 'Hey Jude'."""
01:45:48;01:45:49;"Insane."
01:45:49;01:45:53;"You know, one thing I really liked in the rooftop footage"
01:45:53;01:45:59;"was how positive the response of the man on the street was for the most part."
01:45:59;01:46:02;"People of all ages, they'd be down on the street like,"
01:46:02;01:46:03;"""Do you know who's playing right now?"""
01:46:03;01:46:05;"And people would be like, ""Yeah, it's the Beatles."""
01:46:05;01:46:07;"And there'd be old guys, and they'd be like, ""Do you like the Beatles?"

01:46:08;01:46:10;"And they'd be like, ""I love the Beatles. They're great singers."""
01:46:10;01:46:13;"Yeah, a lot of them are like, ""Oh, they're great. They're great."""
01:46:13;01:46:18;"I almost got the sense that there was almost like a national pride in the family."

01:48:25;01:48:27;"It is insane how many of their classics"
01:48:27;01:48:30;"aren't even on the records."
01:48:30;01:48:31;"Like, is there another--"
01:48:31;01:48:32;"--standalone single?"
01:48:32;01:48:33;"--is there another band like that?"
01:48:33;01:48:37;"I don't-- I don't think so."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"I mean, I think there's like solid standalones,"
01:48:39;01:48:42;"but not like this, like all-time classic."
01:48:42;01:48:45;"Wouldn't it be weird if like Hey Jude"
01:48:45;01:48:47;"had been on the White Album?"
01:48:47;01:48:48;"Yeah."
01:48:48;01:48:50;"It also seemed like they didn't really sweat those decisions."
01:48:50;01:48:54;"Like when they recorded Don't Let Me Down,"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"they were like, put it out as the B-side."
01:48:56;01:48:57;"Right."
01:48:57;01:48:59;"Maybe they were hemming and hawing, but in the movie,"
01:48:59;01:49:00;"there was no hemming and hawing."
01:49:00;01:49:02;"It wasn't like Lennon was like, I really"
01:49:02;01:49:04;"want that to be on side B."
01:49:04;01:49:07;"Well, yeah, also, they just kept things moving."
01:49:07;01:49:09;"They didn't have time to overthink it."
01:49:09;01:49:12;"It is just also like pretty wild that the Beatles just never"
01:49:12;01:49:13;"like--"
01:49:13;01:49:17;"of course, you can look at some songs that are like fourth tier"
01:49:17;01:49:20;"Beatles songs, but they just never dry--"
01:49:20;01:49:21;"like even if you want to like hate, say,"
01:49:21;01:49:25;"like there's a few songs on Let It Be that aren't like all-time"
01:49:25;01:49:28;"or Beatles songs, it still has those singles that just like"
01:49:28;01:49:32;"kind of push it into like cultural ubiquity."
01:49:32;01:49:34;"And it is kind of just amazing that there's just never a dry"
01:49:34;01:49:37;"spell where the Beatles like--"
01:49:37;01:49:39;"you know, if you took like the worst songs on Let It Be,"
01:49:39;01:49:42;"Abby wrote in the White Album, and you made an album,"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"it would still be cool, but that would be like a dud Beatles"
01:49:44;01:49:45;"album."
01:49:45;01:49:46;"Like--"
01:49:46;01:49:46;"Yeah."
01:49:46;01:49:48;"--they never had an album like that."
01:49:48;01:49:50;"I mean, like I love Rolling Stones'"
01:49:50;01:49:53;"Her Satanic Majesty's Request, but like people generally"
01:49:53;01:49:56;"look at that as kind of like they were trying"
01:49:56;01:49:57;"a psychedelic album."
01:49:57;01:50:00;"She's Like a Rainbow was a fun single,"
01:50:00;01:50:02;"but it's not like--"
01:50:02;01:50:03;"it's not an all-timer."
01:50:03;01:50:05;"Like the Beatles don't have an album like that."
01:50:05;01:50:08;"And again, I'm not dissing that album because I really love"
01:50:08;01:50:09;"that Stones album, but it's--"
01:50:09;01:50:10;"you know, that was like--"
01:50:10;01:50:13;"I remember when I first wanted to get that album on CD"
01:50:13;01:50:15;"when I was like 13, 14 or something."
01:50:15;01:50:17;"Really had to like search for it."
01:50:17;01:50:19;"It might have even been like out of print or something."
01:50:19;01:50:22;"I just-- like there's no dud Beatles album."
01:50:22;01:50:25;"[MUSIC - THE BEATLES, ""DUDE BEATLES""]"
01:50:25;01:50:28;"[MUSIC - THE BEATLES, ""DUDE BEATLES""]"
01:50:28;01:50:41;"Another interesting thing about the Beatles"
01:50:41;01:50:45;"is that getting deeper on Wikipedia,"
01:50:45;01:50:50;"everybody made a few like really good records right out the gate."
01:50:50;01:50:50;"Like obviously--"
01:50:50;01:50:51;"Yeah."
01:50:51;01:50:54;"--George Harrison, All Things Must Pass, All Time, Classic."
01:50:54;01:50:55;"Yeah."
01:50:55;01:50:59;"Plastigono, Ben and Imagine, Beloved, Ram, Very Good."
01:50:59;01:51:01;"And then every McCarty album had some good songs."
01:51:01;01:51:06;"But like within like four years, all of the big three songwriters"
01:51:06;01:51:12;"and the Beatles had released albums that had like been hated."
01:51:12;01:51:15;"Like horrible reviews, like didn't do well."
01:51:15;01:51:16;"Within a few years--"
01:51:16;01:51:16;"Wow."
01:51:16;01:51:19;"--after All Things Must Pass, Harrison put out albums that like--"
01:51:19;01:51:21;"people were just like, sucks."
01:51:21;01:51:25;"Even Lennon, the album he made after Imagine,"
01:51:25;01:51:27;"people were just like, lost the [BLEEP] plot, man."
01:51:27;01:51:28;"Pathetic."
01:51:28;01:51:29;"Was that Mind Games?"
01:51:29;01:51:29;"No, no."
01:51:29;01:51:33;"It's called Somewhere in New York or something."
01:51:33;01:51:34;"I love Mind Games."
01:51:34;01:51:35;"Oh, yeah."
01:51:35;01:51:35;"Whole record."
01:51:35;01:51:37;"That was kind of like his comeback."
01:51:37;01:51:37;"Was it?"
01:51:37;01:51:38;"OK."
01:51:38;01:51:39;"Sometime in New York City."
01:51:39;01:51:43;"It's like one of those weird albums that's like partially in the studio"
01:51:43;01:51:45;"and partially live."
01:51:45;01:51:47;"So that came out June '72."
01:51:47;01:51:50;"And people were just like, damn, Lennon lost the [BLEEP] plot."
01:51:50;01:51:51;"This album's pathetic."
01:51:51;01:51:54;"So again, that's like within three years of Get Back,"
01:51:54;01:51:58;"he dropped an album considered such a dud that he"
01:51:58;01:52:01;"must have been reading the reviews and being like, [BLEEP] damn, I [BLEEP] up."
01:52:01;01:52:02;"Or whatever."
01:52:02;01:52:04;"He might have been like, [BLEEP] them, they don't understand."
01:52:04;01:52:07;"But he was dealing with like some serious pushback against his art."
01:52:07;01:52:08;"Yeah."
01:52:08;01:52:10;"And I think the first McCartney solo album, it did pretty well."
01:52:10;01:52:14;"But people considered him the culprit for the Beatles ending."
01:52:14;01:52:16;"And they were like, this sucks, full of [BLEEP]"
01:52:16;01:52:17;"I love that first McCartney."
01:52:17;01:52:18;"Like they all got their--"
01:52:18;01:52:20;"They thought it was just like--"
01:52:20;01:52:20;"They all got their--"
01:52:20;01:52:21;"--tossed off."
01:52:21;01:52:22;"Too sweet."
01:52:22;01:52:26;"And I mean, he definitely dropped some undeniable music."
01:52:26;01:52:30;"But people were always a little bit hard on him and certainly on Wings."
01:52:30;01:52:32;"But all of them made excellent solo work."
01:52:32;01:52:36;"But I guess even with the Beatles at the time,"
01:52:36;01:52:39;"they might have felt-- they got some bad reviews here and there."
01:52:39;01:52:43;"And they probably felt like, damn, did we really let everybody down"
01:52:43;01:52:44;"by putting out Let It Be?"
01:52:44;01:52:47;"Should we just have ended with Abbey Road?"
01:52:47;01:52:49;"Yeah, that's a funny one."
01:52:49;01:52:53;"I mean, yeah, they'd set the standard so high that it's really"
01:52:53;01:52:56;"funny to just trash Let It Be."

01:55:28;01:55:29;"What principles did they--"
01:55:29;01:55:30;"wow."
01:55:30;01:55:32;"I mean, I guess it shows that nothing's changed."
01:55:32;01:55:36;"John Gabry writing for High Fidelity magazine"
01:55:36;01:55:40;"said that the album, ""It was not nearly as bad as the movie"
01:55:40;01:55:42;"and positively wonderful compared"
01:55:42;01:55:46;"to the recent solo releases by McCartney and Starr."
01:55:46;01:55:48;"He admitted that Let It Be, Get Back, and Two of Us"
01:55:48;01:55:50;"were pretty good, but derided the Long and Winding Road"
01:55:50;01:55:52;"and Across the Universe."""
01:55:52;01:55:55;"And specifically, he added out for Across the Universe,"
01:55:55;01:55:57;"which he described as ""bloated and self-satisfied,"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"the kind of song we've come to expect"
01:55:59;01:56:02;"from these rich, privileged proto teenagers."""
01:56:02;01:56:03;"Wow."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"Damn, just like a harsh."
01:56:05;01:56:07;"Throwing out the privileged word."
01:56:07;01:56:09;"Yeah, the more things change."
01:56:09;01:56:10;"Yeah, truly."
01:56:10;01:56:13;"Anyway, that's what the critics have to say,"
01:56:13;01:56:15;"but check it out for yourself."
01:56:15;01:56:16;"The album's called Let It Be."
01:56:16;01:56:18;"It's on all the streaming services."
01:56:18;01:56:20;"You could probably get it on vinyl too."
01:56:20;01:56:22;"The band is the Beatles."
01:56:22;01:56:24;"We hope we'll hear more from them."
01:56:24;01:56:26;"Check it out, TC Heads."
01:56:26;01:56:27;"All right, see everybody in two weeks."
01:56:27;01:56:27;"Peace."
