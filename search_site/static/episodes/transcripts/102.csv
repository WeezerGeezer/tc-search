00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, back once again. I catch up with Jake remotely as he is currently in Calgary, Canada."
00:08;00:14;"And we have a very special guest in the studio, Justin Vernon of Boney Ver."
00:14;00:21;"We'll be talking about his local Chipotle, Hot Cheetos, and so much more."
00:21;00:26;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:26;00:30;"Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep, Spongebob 1."
00:31;00:39;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:39;00:46;"They were a friend, probably, of my rightful chances"
00:46;00:53;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:53;01:00;"And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go"
01:00;01:05;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:05;01:11;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:11;01:15;"Leave it on me babe"
01:15;01:20;"Time Crisis, back once again. But this is a weird one, I'm alone in the studio."
01:20;01:26;"Jake is in Canada, Seinfeld 2000's home country. Seinfeld 2000's not even here."
01:26;01:29;"Well, today's gonna be a very unusual but special show."
01:29;01:32;"We got Justin Vernon of Boney Ver coming through."
01:32;01:36;"A highly unusual Time Crisis, having a prominent musician as a guest."
01:36;01:39;"But before that, we gotta get Jake on the phone."
01:39;01:43;"So let's check in with Jake. I can't start Time Crisis by myself, this just feels weird."
01:43;01:47;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:47;01:50;"[Phone ringing]"
01:50;01:51;"Hello?"
01:51;01:52;"What up Jake?"
01:52;01:54;"Is this Apple Global Security?"
01:54;01:55;"Is that what it says on your phone?"
01:55;01:58;"Uh, yeah. I thought I was maybe in trouble."
01:58;02:04;"Tim Cook, I finally listened back to some Time Crisis and didn't think you were appropriately respectful towards the brand."
02:04;02:10;"Didn't sign off. Well, you know, Seinfeld was absconded to Japan for all those months."
02:10;02:12;"I've been whisked away to Canada."
02:12;02:16;"You've been going there a lot because Hannah's directing a TV show in Calgary."
02:16;02:25;"There's a 10-part miniseries in which Kate Mara plays a high school teacher who starts having an affair with one of her students, played by Nick Robinson."
02:25;02:28;"You know, I'll just do some low-key publicity for it right now."
02:28;02:35;"I mean, this story really delves into the like, deep emotional, ethical, and legal consequences of this affair."
02:35;02:37;"Oh, I bet."
02:37;02:39;"And so what do you do when you're up there?"
02:39;02:50;"I've heard it said before, and it's also been my experience, that the first five minutes of being on a set of a film or program could be the most exciting five minutes of
your life."
02:50;02:53;"Starting around minute six, a boredom sets in."
02:53;02:55;"So deep and so buff."
02:55;02:57;"[laughs]"
02:57;03:03;"I guess it's funny. That's one thing we have in common. We both partnered up with people who spend time on sets."
03:03;03:05;"Are you posted up in like, the green room?"
03:05;03:08;"Because you've got to be real quiet when people are doing takes and stuff."
03:08;03:10;"Are you sitting in a director's chair?"
03:10;03:15;"This week, I'm not on set that much. I went last night for about three hours."
03:15;03:18;"Do they have one of those chairs that has an embroidered Jake on the back?"
03:18;03:19;"I wish."
03:19;03:21;"They let you sit in Hannah's chair while she's busy?"
03:21;03:28;"There's like another chair. There's a spare chair. I think they should make a chair that has my Wikipedia t-shirt entry on the chair."
03:28;03:32;"American painter. Is there always somebody giving you a little headset?"
03:32;03:40;"Yeah. So I had a comm set and I watched them do like 12 takes of the same 30 second exchange from like all these different angles."
03:40;03:42;"And you're like kind of watching the monitor?"
03:42;03:45;"Yeah. Watching the monitor and I'm listening."
03:45;03:49;"But I mean, like after a few hours of that, I mean, I read like a book usually."
03:49;03:54;"I went down and visited in Austin a few weeks ago and I read like 200 pages of a book."
03:54;03:57;"You know, it's like actually good for like getting reading done."
03:57;03:59;"What book were you reading?"
03:59;04:03;"When I was up here last time, I was reading Philip Roth's The Plot Against America."
04:03;04:05;"Oh, yeah. I read that. That's a great book."
04:05;04:12;"Great novel. So I finished that. And then the new book I'm reading is this one. Nonfiction. It's by the guy that wrote Sapiens."
04:12;04:14;"Oh, yeah. Yuval Harari."
04:14;04:20;"Yeah. Harari. Yeah. He has a new book that are just sort of big kind of questions for the 21st century."
04:20;04:24;"AI, biotech, stuff I don't understand."
04:24;04:27;"So you're just posted up next to the stage."
04:27;04:32;"Yeah. I mean, like I said, I was there for like a couple hours yesterday."
04:32;04:35;"I mean, I've been here for like three or four days. That was my first time to set."
04:35;04:38;"I'm not going to go today. I've been hanging out with our dog."
04:38;04:41;"I've been going for runs, taking the dog to the dog park."
04:41;04:44;"I've been writing songs. I've just been chilling, man."
04:44;04:47;"You're really blossoming up there."
04:47;04:49;"It's a real creative Renaissance."
04:49;04:51;"What's your new dog's name?"
04:51;04:52;"Al. Allie."
04:52;04:55;"Oh, right. After Stars Born."
04:55;04:59;"Oh, I forgot that. I think we talked about this on the show a little bit, maybe once."
04:59;05:01;"But yeah, first of all, rest in peace to Marty."
05:01;05:03;"I don't think we have discussed this."
05:03;05:08;"Jake and Hannah had a great dog named Marty. I'm not much of a dog person, but I always give it up to a great dog."
05:08;05:11;"Marty was really a great dog and he had a good run."
05:11;05:15;"But now you guys have, OK, Allie."
05:15;05:17;"But you're saying Al more often than Allie?"
05:17;05:24;"Yeah, we like half jokingly, half serious named Allie after the Lady Gaga character from Stars Born."
05:24;05:25;"That's tight."
05:25;05:30;"But we also semi-planned on calling her Al, like naming a girl dog Al."
05:30;05:33;"It just seemed like a fun name for her."
05:33;05:36;"And at the time when we got her, we had Marty still."
05:36;05:37;"Marty was aging quickly."
05:37;05:38;"Yeah."
05:38;05:40;"So we were doing kind of like a dog crossfade."
05:40;05:41;"Right."
05:41;05:45;"So for a while we had Marty and Al, which is like, that's a great combo."
05:45;05:47;"Just two guys down at the local bar."
05:47;05:49;"Marty and Al."
05:49;05:50;"Yeah."
05:50;05:52;"And then Marty died like three months after we got Al."
05:52;05:54;"So now we're kicking it with Al."
05:54;05:56;"So have you taken Al to Tim Hortons?"
05:56;05:58;"Not yet. I should do that."
05:58;06:00;"I should take her through the drive-thru."
06:00;06:02;"What kind of area?"
06:02;06:04;"So Hannah's up there for a long time."
06:04;06:06;"She's been up here since early July."
06:06;06:07;"Whoa."
06:07;06:10;"And this is my like fifth time up here since then."
06:10;06:11;"Deep."
06:11;06:13;"But this is my longest stay. I'm here for like eight days."
06:13;06:17;"I think I've talked on the show about Gratitude Cafe in Calgary,"
06:17;06:20;"which is a place I went into and I asked the person,"
06:20;06:24;"""Is this related to Cafe Gratitude in the States?"""
06:24;06:27;"And they were like, ""You know what? It really bugs me when people say that."""
06:27;06:29;"""Okay, maybe I was inspired by them. They didn't have to sue me."""
06:29;06:31;"And I was like, ""Okay, whoa, whoa."""
06:31;06:34;"But there is a place called Gratitude Cafe, as I recall, in Calgary."
06:34;06:36;"That was the neighborhood that I walked around in."
06:36;06:40;"That's in the Kensington neighborhood of Calgary, according to Wikipedia."
06:40;06:42;"Wait, so they got sued by Cafe Gratitude?"
06:42;06:45;"Yeah, I was talking to the proprietor and I was making small talk,"
06:45;06:48;"and clearly this place was based on Cafe Gratitude."
06:48;06:49;"Oh, my God."
06:49;06:51;"And for people who don't know, a hundred episodes deep,"
06:51;06:53;"I can't remember if I've told this story before."
06:53;06:57;"In L.A., San Francisco, actually there's one in Kansas City."
06:57;07:02;"There's this kind of crunchy chain of restaurants called Cafe Gratitude,"
07:02;07:09;"and it's vegan and the food has names like humble, you know, these adjectives."
07:09;07:11;"And so you could order something and say, ""Okay, I get the humble,"""
07:11;07:14;"and they'll say, ""Yes, you are humble."""
07:14;07:17;"And they used to have like a question of the day, so it was just kind of like--"
07:17;07:20;"Very forced hippie ethos."
07:20;07:26;"Well, there was this bit of an issue that some employees felt that they were being pressured to join a cult."
07:26;07:28;"We could talk about that some other time."
07:28;07:30;"I don't have enough info to take sides on that one."
07:30;07:31;"Sure."
07:31;07:35;"But anyway, yeah, a crunchy vegan place, and the ones in L.A. are very popular."
07:35;07:36;"There's one in Beverly Hills now."
07:36;07:37;"Yeah."
07:37;07:42;"So I imagine I'm walking around Calgary, and I roll into a place, a little vegan cafe,"
07:42;07:46;"in this kind of cute, college-y neighborhood called Gratitude Cafe,"
07:46;07:51;"and I look at the menu and it's all vegan stuff and it has names like humble, satisfied, whatever."
07:51;07:56;"So of course I'm like, ""Oh, this must be an outpost of the same restaurant,"
07:56;07:59;"small restaurant group that I've seen around the country."""
07:59;08:05;"And the proprietor comes up, and I say, ""Oh, hey, is this part of the Cafe Gratitude family?"""
08:05;08:10;"And immediately the person looked at me like I was the biggest ass[bleep] on earth."
08:10;08:16;"And like I said, had this vibe of kind of like, ""Yeah, you know, it's funny how people just come in here"
08:16;08:18;"and they want to bring in this bad energy."""
08:18;08:21;"She kept talking about energy, which was hilarious."
08:21;08:22;"And she even got into some weird things."
08:22;08:24;"So she was like, ""Okay, so I was traveling around in the States,"
08:24;08:29;"and I happened to go to a place called Cafe Gratitude, and then I opened my own place called Gratitude Cafe."
08:29;08:31;"I'm doing my own thing up here."""
08:31;08:38;"And then she alluded to there being a lawsuit, which I guess it's very hard to sue for copyright stuff internationally,"
08:38;08:39;"as I understand it."
08:39;08:42;"So I think they were protected by that."
08:42;08:46;"Clearly it was a sore point, so I felt bad about it, but it kept going on."
08:46;08:48;"And then at one point said, ""Yeah, you know, it's funny."
08:48;08:51;"It's like we have very high energy food here."
08:51;08:53;"The food vibrates at a very high energy level."
08:53;08:58;"And sometimes when people come in here with kind of bad energy, you know, the food doesn't really work for them."""
08:58;09:02;"And I was kind of like, ""My energy is okay."""
09:02;09:05;"If I was speaking the truth, I'd be like, ""That's cool that you ripped them off."
09:05;09:08;"That's a weird, interesting move,"" but they didn't want to hear that."
09:08;09:37;"♪"
09:37;09:57;"♪"
09:57;10:21;"♪"
10:21;10:23;"But anyway, that was my Calgary experience."
10:23;10:25;"Are you walking distance to Tim Hortons?"
10:25;10:31;"Yes, yes. There is one on the Cloud Trail, which is like a sort of a six-lane,"
10:31;10:34;"like very heavily commercialized throughway."
10:34;10:36;"And there's a drive-through Tim Hortons there."
10:36;10:37;"I don't know if I'd want to walk there."
10:37;10:42;"It'd be sort of like walk through like a Home Depot parking lot and like that kind of vibe."
10:42;10:44;"Every morning I wake at dawn in Calgary."
10:44;10:46;"[laughs]"
10:46;10:49;"I take my dog, Allie from A Star is Born,"
10:49;10:53;"and we traverse the Home Depot parking lot to the Tim Hortons."
10:53;10:57;"Take the pedestrian overpass over the six lanes of traffic."
10:57;11:01;"You know, Vampire Weekend is playing Calgary next year."
11:01;11:03;"Oh, yeah. Part of that Bend-"
11:03;11:06;"That's the run I want you to come on next August."
11:06;11:09;"From Bend to Boise, Missoula, Calgary, Edmonton."
11:09;11:11;"That's a five-show run."
11:11;11:12;"That's a good run."
11:12;11:13;"Guess who's opening that whole run?"
11:13;11:17;"Not Richard Pictures, but probably the next best thing."
11:17;11:18;"Um, Twiddle?"
11:18;11:19;"It's Twiddle."
11:19;11:22;"I saw John and Ryan from Richard Pictures the other night,"
11:22;11:25;"and I told them, I was like, ""You got to keep this very DL,"""
11:25;11:29;"but Twiddle's opening a leg for Vampire, and their minds were blown."
11:29;11:31;"Let's bring Richard Pictures out on that one, too."
11:31;11:35;"I mean, I don't know if there's time for a full set, but you guys just sit in."
11:35;11:38;"I think that's the leg to really do like a caravan on,"
11:38;11:40;"and it's mid-August. It's going to be beautiful out there."
11:40;11:41;"Yeah."
11:41;11:43;"I think I just saw him walk in, but so, you know, like the guest today,"
11:43;11:46;"I find this is a very unusual time crisis."
11:46;11:48;"I guess it kind of worked out well because you're gone,"
11:48;11:52;"so we can't have our usual just Ezra and Jake banter."
11:52;11:53;"Yeah."
11:53;11:55;"We got Justin from Boney Vare."
11:55;11:58;"It feels very like professional podcast in a way."
11:58;12:01;"I'm excited, and I think it's going to be very chill, but it's like,"
12:01;12:03;"I don't think the content is going to--"
12:03;12:04;"On the podcast today."
12:04;12:07;"Yeah, yeah, I don't think the content's going to be professional podcast,"
12:07;12:10;"but I'm just like, ""Wow, we got like a major guest in the building."""
12:10;12:12;"That's great. I'm bummed I'm missing it."
12:12;12:15;"But, yeah, you can go full Marin without me there."
12:15;12:16;"I don't know what he's expecting."
12:16;12:18;"I don't even know what I'm expecting."
12:18;12:20;"We might have gotten a little parent trapped into this."
12:20;12:22;"Do you think he knows TC?"
12:22;12:23;"I don't know."
12:23;12:25;"Well, maybe he doesn't even know that I'm the host."
12:25;12:26;"Maybe they--"
12:26;12:27;"[laughs]"
12:27;12:31;"Someone just like gave him a list of like media asks,"
12:31;12:34;"and they're just like, ""For this album, you know, what do you think?"
12:34;12:38;"Sit down with Pitchfork, maybe Billboard, Time Crisis."""
12:38;12:40;"That's an interesting name. Sure. We'll see."
12:40;12:41;"[laughs]"
12:41;12:42;"No, I'm excited to talk to him."
12:42;12:46;"I think we've only met once before, and I have a great impression of him."
12:46;12:47;"I'm an admirer."
12:47;12:48;"That's tight, man."
12:48;12:51;"I know he just played that big show at the Forum, which I missed,"
12:51;12:55;"but I saw clips on Instagram, and it looked dope."
12:55;12:57;"Yeah, they've got like a very special show right now,"
12:57;12:59;"some new technology. I'm curious about it."
12:59;13:03;"Do you have any like bony-vair questions?"
13:03;13:04;"You got any--"
13:04;13:05;"[laughs]"
13:05;13:07;"About to send any way to prep me?"
13:07;13:09;"Oh, jeez. On the spot here."
13:09;13:12;"I love that he's tight with Hornsby."
13:12;13:15;"That's definitely a good line of inquiry right there."
13:15;13:16;"Has he actually played with Hornsby?"
13:16;13:18;"Yeah, he like produced his album."
13:18;13:20;"Whoa. I've got to check that out."
13:20;13:22;"I'm going to introduce him to our world a little bit"
13:22;13:24;"because I feel like, you know, as an artist too,"
13:24;13:27;"I feel like we always get asked the exact same questions over and over again."
13:27;13:31;"So, you know, I want to like ask him what he knows about Richard Montanez,"
13:31;13:35;"Jamflow Man, things of that nature, maybe Tim Hortons."
13:35;13:38;"Have you ever been to his part of Wisconsin, Eau Claire?"
13:38;13:39;"Eau Claire?"
13:39;13:41;"No. I never have. I want to."
13:41;13:43;"Have you ever gone deep on Wisconsin?"
13:43;13:47;"No. Jeez. It might be a state I've never been to even."
13:47;13:48;"Get out of here."
13:48;13:50;"You never been to Madison or Milwaukee?"
13:50;13:51;"Uh-oh."
13:51;13:52;"All right."
13:52;13:54;"Glaring oversight. Yeah."
13:54;13:57;"I guess we're going to also talk about Wisconsin musicians later."
13:57;14:00;"Who's on that list besides him?"
14:00;14:04;"Is there like a big band out of Madison or Milwaukee like back in the day?"
14:04;14:07;"There are probably people who were like born there and then moved."
14:07;14:09;"I bet there's some stuff like that."
14:09;14:12;"Wait, is this list implying that Steve Miller is from Wisconsin?"
14:12;14:13;"Wait, what?"
14:13;14:14;"Is that what you're telling me?"
14:14;14:15;"Are you guys doing like a--"
14:15;14:17;"That's what the top five is going to be."
14:17;14:19;"Top five Jersey versus Wisconsin."
14:19;14:20;"That's tight."
14:20;14:23;"Top five artists or songs?"
14:23;14:24;"I guess artists."
14:24;14:26;"I'm seeing Steve Miller on there."
14:26;14:29;"New Jersey is just going to-- New Jersey is going to mop the floor."
14:29;14:32;"I guess I got to ask him to weigh in on Steve Miller."
14:32;14:35;"I hope he doesn't feel like it's got you journalism."
14:35;14:39;"He walks out just like I don't want to talk about these hot button issues."
14:39;14:42;"He walks out, he's just like what the hell was that?"
14:42;14:44;"Yeah."
14:44;14:45;"Jerry Garcia versus Steve Miller."
14:45;14:47;"Don't do this to me."
14:47;14:50;"I told my publicist to tell you guys I was off the table."
14:50;14:53;"I didn't want to get political."
14:53;14:55;"What the [bleep]?"
14:55;14:57;"That's how you lose an election."
14:57;14:58;"That's right."
14:58;15:01;"Well, [bleep] man, sorry to miss the show."
15:01;15:03;"It's all good."
15:03;15:05;"You should watch Tim Hortons while you're up there."
15:05;15:06;"I will, man."
15:06;15:08;"Really soak up that Canadian culture."
15:08;15:09;"I'm on it."
15:09;15:10;"Talk to you soon."
15:10;15:11;"Have a good one."
15:11;15:12;"All right, dude."
15:12;15:13;"I'll talk to you later."
15:13;15:14;"All right, peace."
15:14;15:15;"Peace."
15:16;15:19;"I will see you all from now down the back of a ridge."
15:19;15:24;"There's just something that I've got to show you."
15:24;15:29;"There is no Miranda's ride in the car made in case."
15:29;15:34;"It ain't nothing that you say is true."
15:34;15:39;"With your long arms tight, you just give some time."
15:39;15:44;"Prisoner does include my dues."
15:44;15:47;"You'll meet your standard premonitions."
15:47;15:49;"All this phallic repetition."
15:49;15:54;"Boy, you'll tell yourself a tale or two."
15:54;15:59;"Manly too, manly crew."
16:15;16:20;"Well, I know that we set off for a common place."
16:20;16:25;"And the lads here have never told you."
16:25;16:30;"How much care is there of some American life?"
16:30;16:35;"There's not a second in our streets."
16:35;16:38;"So cerebral, it's right."
16:38;16:45;"Those little men, pathogenic, on the big freedom."
16:45;16:48;"It'll be a long day of fixing."
16:48;16:51;"Make something else your mission."
16:51;16:54;"Boy, they've been so hard to kill."
16:54;16:57;"And I love you."
16:57;17:01;"All right, we're now joined in the studio by Justin Vernon of Boney Bear."
17:01;17:02;"What's up?"
17:02;17:03;"Great to have you."
17:03;17:04;"Thanks for having me, Ezra."
17:04;17:08;"I was just saying to Jake, this feels like unusually formal for our show."
17:08;17:10;"This feels like we're like a real show now."
17:10;17:14;"We got a real guest just sitting down."
17:14;17:15;"I barely even know where to start."
17:15;17:20;"But I guess one thing I was thinking of is we haven't met in person very often."
17:20;17:22;"Is it possible we've only met once?"
17:22;17:24;"I think it's twice."
17:24;17:25;"Oh, twice."
17:25;17:29;"There was one time where we went out in Minneapolis after I came to see you guys play at First Ave."
17:29;17:31;"This has got to be eight years ago, though."
17:31;17:33;"Yeah, I think we were touring our second album."
17:33;17:34;"Maybe one other time."
17:34;17:36;"Right, so you came and saw us at Minneapolis, which was sick."
17:36;17:38;"We really appreciated that."
17:38;17:40;"Did we go to Sneaky Pete's?"
17:40;17:41;"Is that what we did?"
17:41;17:42;"That's 100% what we did."
17:42;17:44;"That was a weird kind of dark time."
17:44;17:45;"Yeah."
17:45;17:48;"Not hanging out with you, but I think there was--"
17:48;17:51;"maybe we'd been there for a couple days for some reason,"
17:51;17:54;"and we'd gone to this place, Sneaky Pete's,"
17:54;18:00;"which was kind of like a downtown big empty sports bar, like a little brutal."
18:00;18:01;"Did we play like beer pong?"
18:01;18:05;"Yeah, what was really weird about it is that it's really close to First Ave,"
18:05;18:07;"like right by the Target Center, Sneaky Pete's."
18:07;18:10;"And I had never been there, and you guys were like, ""You guys want to go to Sneaky Pete's?"""
18:10;18:13;"I was like, ""Yeah, I guess so."""
18:13;18:16;"And usually it's like you're a sold-out show,"
18:16;18:18;"so there's a couple thousand people walking around down there,"
18:18;18:23;"and what was so weird, it was just Vampire Weekend and me and Mikey,"
18:23;18:25;"my guitar player at the time."
18:25;18:26;"There was like no one else in there."
18:26;18:27;"In Sneaky Pete's."
18:27;18:29;"We just played beer pong or looked at each other."
18:29;18:33;"And it was the type of like really big place that's like blasting black-eyed peas."
18:33;18:35;"It's like made to be packed on a weekend."
18:35;18:39;"I don't know if we were there on like a weeknight, but just kind of like really bad vibe."
18:39;18:40;"It was empty."
18:40;18:41;"Really bad vibe."
18:42;18:44;"Did you walk away just being like, ""These guys are kind of weird."""
18:44;18:48;"No, I was like, ""That's 100% what I would have done and failed as well."""
18:48;18:49;"So I've gone to Sneaky Pete's."
18:49;18:51;"I think we went there two nights in a row."
18:51;18:52;"Jesus."
18:52;18:53;"Yeah, it was highly unusual."
18:53;18:55;"I didn't go with you the second time."
18:55;18:57;"Yeah, that must have been the first time we met."
18:57;18:59;"Yeah, I guess so."
18:59;19:00;"I never remember."
19:00;19:01;"Yeah."
19:01;19:03;"There's a chance we've never met."
19:03;19:05;"It's possible."
19:05;19:07;"That didn't happen."
19:07;19:08;"Yeah, Sneaky Pete's, man."
19:08;19:09;"That's how Sneaky Pete is."
19:09;19:11;"Yeah, it's a very sneaky experience."
19:11;19:14;"Well, man, so many places to start."
19:14;19:19;"One of my first questions, or it's not a question, it's just something that I've always said,"
19:19;19:22;"because I don't want to be a brown noser, but I've always had a very good impression of you."
19:22;19:24;"Oh, that's kind of you."
19:24;19:26;"I've always just been like, ""You know what?"
19:26;19:29;"Guy seems pretty cool."""
19:29;19:35;"And one reason I think, I don't know if this is like a self-hating coastal elite thing,"
19:35;19:37;"but I know I've said this like a few times to random people."
19:37;19:41;"I was like, ""I love that that dude lives in Wisconsin."""
19:41;19:45;"There's a part of me that wishes I had a place like Wisconsin to call home."
19:45;19:48;"I'm from the tri-state area, New York, New Jersey, so it just feels more complicated,"
19:48;19:53;"because it's like the place that feels like your home is also a big media center"
19:53;19:56;"and people have all sorts of weird conflicting feelings about it."
19:56;19:58;"But I guess I do think it's unusual."
19:58;20:00;"I don't know if this is something you've talked about at length."
20:00;20:02;"I did a little bit of prep."
20:02;20:05;"I skimmed that recent Pitchfork article, but I didn't want to go too deep."
20:05;20:07;"I want to keep things fresh."
20:07;20:09;"So I don't know if this is something you've talked about at length,"
20:09;20:13;"but I just feel like many people in the music industry feel like they have to be"
20:13;20:17;"in a big media center, and you seem like a notable exception."
20:17;20:18;"Yeah."
20:18;20:21;"For me, like you said, it's complicated on the coasts."
20:21;20:25;"And while I love it, I mean, I'm out here right now relaxing and seeing the ocean"
20:25;20:28;"and getting those vibes, getting the Cali vibes."
20:28;20:33;"But for whatever reason, I just know where I'm supposed to be."
20:33;20:37;"And in Wisconsin, one of my favorite things is like people might recognize me"
20:37;20:40;"at the grocery store or something, but really it's not like, ""Oh, hey."""
20:40;20:43;"No, it's not like, ""Oh, man, how'd you do it?"""
20:43;20:47;"It's more like nobody's really trying to prove anything to anyone"
20:47;20:53;"because nobody has the energy to get through the winter and also be like hustling."
20:53;20:58;"There's no hustle, which can have a backfiring capacity as well."
20:58;21:01;"Although I will say, as somebody who spent a lot of time in New York and L.A.,"
21:01;21:07;"one thing is if you are some sort of like--not like tabloid magazine level famous,"
21:07;21:10;"but just like indie type person, there are certain neighborhoods where you feel"
21:10;21:13;"a little bit like you're running into people who want to talk about music."
21:13;21:17;"But when you go to like the really crazy fancy neighborhoods, it doesn't happen."
21:17;21:19;"Well, maybe you should move to Beverly Hills."
21:30;21:33;"You're listening to..."
21:33;21:36;"Time Crisis on Beats 1."
21:36;21:38;"Have you ever spent a long time in New York or L.A.?"
21:38;21:40;"Not a long time. Probably two weeks is the top."
21:40;21:42;"Oh, really? Never even hit the months?"
21:42;21:43;"Nope."
21:43;21:45;"This is like truly something that's never even like come up."
21:45;21:47;"Not even crossed my mind."
21:47;21:52;"I mean, this year, our recording studio kind of where I live in the house"
21:52;21:55;"was under construction for like a good year, year and a half."
21:55;21:59;"And so I started looking around like maybe I should check out New York or L.A."
21:59;22:02;"You know, I'm 37 years old. I should try something new."
22:02;22:05;"I just can't. I just don't want to."
22:05;22:07;"I hang out in Minneapolis a lot."
22:07;22:09;"I guess when I come here, I'm so thrilled."
22:09;22:12;"You know, I love New York. I really love L.A."
22:12;22:16;"But every time I like look at a lease or I'm just like I got to go see my mom."
22:16;22:17;"I got to go..."
22:17;22:19;"Right, because your whole family is posted up there."
22:19;22:22;"Yeah, and I just like the woods for whatever reason."
22:22;22:25;"And it's real. I've like checked myself."
22:25;22:31;"It's like it's a real thing. Like I get calmed when I hit the tarmac in Minneapolis."
22:31;22:34;"And I'm close to those things that I recognize."
22:34;22:38;"When you go home, Minneapolis is the closest international airport."
22:38;22:40;"And then how long is the drive from there to your house?"
22:40;22:42;"90 minutes."
22:42;22:43;"Oof."
22:43;22:44;"Yeah."
22:44;22:45;"That's not a bummer?"
22:45;22:48;"It's been a humongous bummer in my entire life."
22:48;22:50;"Did just get the electric car, though."
22:50;22:52;"And that makes it sweet."
22:52;22:54;"Because it's more pleasant being in."
22:54;22:57;"You don't have to actually do anything with your legs or arms."
22:57;22:59;"You just listen to music and smoke a j."
22:59;23:01;"It's a more pleasant experience."
23:01;23:02;"Yeah."
23:02;23:06;"But then I noticed that you just announced some Asia dates."
23:06;23:07;"And I saw you're playing Jakarta."
23:07;23:09;"Yeah, never been."
23:09;23:11;"We played there once back in the day. We had a great show."
23:11;23:17;"But Jakarta to Minneapolis, you must have some brutal travel days getting home."
23:17;23:18;"There are some."
23:18;23:22;"Then again, though, when you're flying to either the coast, you're right in the middle."
23:22;23:26;"Minneapolis is like low-key one of my favorite airports in the whole world."
23:26;23:29;"Right. That's true. If you have to go to New York or L.A., you're splitting the difference."
23:29;23:30;"Yeah."
23:30;23:32;"And so do you actually live in the woods?"
23:32;23:33;"Yeah."
23:33;23:36;"The studio--well, the studio is empty right now, like I said."
23:36;23:40;"But I'm living in this guest house just through the woods from the studio"
23:40;23:45;"while we're redoing the residency and the recording parts of the house."
23:45;23:48;"But when you go into town, the town is Eau Claire. Is that how you say it?"
23:48;23:49;"Yep."
23:49;23:50;"How far is that?"
23:50;23:52;"10, 15 minutes."
23:52;23:53;"Yeah."
23:53;23:56;"So, I mean, we're out there, but it's close enough to get into town."
23:56;23:59;"And we sort of got this little mini commune thing going."
23:59;24:01;"Like, we got a big garden going now."
24:01;24:06;"A couple of friends of mine work that land, and we try to cook that food."
24:06;24:07;"Yeah."
24:07;24:08;"Yeah, it's a little bit wanderlusty."
24:08;24:10;"So you don't need to be at a coffee shop."
24:10;24:11;"Nah."
24:11;24:13;"Do you like coffee shops?"
24:13;24:14;"Yeah."
24:14;24:16;"Like on tour, you'll hit a coffee shop?"
24:16;24:17;"Yeah. Yeah, for sure."
24:17;24:21;"So typical day at home, what's happening in the morning?"
24:21;24:25;"Well, lately it's just extremely boring because there's no music to make."
24:25;24:26;"Yeah."
24:26;24:30;"But, I don't know, wake up, look at the field of horses, and then--"
24:30;24:31;"You got horses?"
24:31;24:33;"I don't, but the neighbors do."
24:33;24:36;"And they come up really close to the house."
24:36;24:40;"Just hang out with the cats and just look at the horses in the field and just hang out."
24:40;24:43;"And you got a lot of people living with you or people come and go?"
24:43;24:44;"Like you said, it's kind of a commune vibe."
24:44;24:46;"Yeah, it's always been really full on."
24:46;24:49;"But like I said, lately it's just been me and this guest house."
24:49;24:53;"And that's kind of why I'm out here because I have gone a little nuts, believe it or not."
24:53;24:55;"I do like my alone time, but--"
24:55;24:56;"There is a limit."
24:57;24:58;"Do you have to have coffee first thing?"
24:58;24:59;"Are you brain dead?"
24:59;25:00;"I'm not."
25:00;25:01;"Don't talk to me until I've had my coffee?"
25:01;25:03;"I'll skip a couple days, actually."
25:03;25:04;"Really?"
25:04;25:05;"I can skip a day or two."
25:05;25:07;"If I have two cups of coffee, I will [bleep] die."
25:07;25:08;"Really?"
25:08;25:10;"Yeah, it's like overdose zone."
25:10;25:14;"So it's like a one black cup of coffee, Colombian beans only."
25:14;25:15;"You make it yourself?"
25:15;25:16;"Yeah, pour over."
25:16;25:18;"No Nespresso or Keurig?"
25:18;25:20;"God, isn't Nespresso sad?"
25:20;25:21;"I'm not mad at Nespresso."
25:21;25:22;"No?"
25:22;25:30;"Sometimes I think about the fact that this very high percentage of coffee that I drink is passing through plastic, and I get a little grossed out."
25:30;25:31;"Yeah."
25:31;25:32;"Because it wasn't always like that."
25:32;25:36;"But I think Nespresso, like I appreciate the George Clooney connection."
25:36;25:37;"It kind of--"
25:37;25:41;"I was just about to say, he makes it seem okay."
25:41;25:42;"He makes it seem kind of classy."
25:42;25:47;"I'll say one thing is that I think we have a lot in common, but obviously there's a few differences."
25:47;25:49;"And one is that I'm like full brain dead."
25:49;25:52;"I am kind of don't talk to me until I've had my coffee."
25:52;25:54;"Like bad mood, feel stupid."
25:54;25:55;"Oh, wow."
25:55;25:56;"Feel bad about myself."
25:56;25:59;"I don't think it's cool to be like, oh, I'm a Java hound."
25:59;26:04;"It does feel almost like a quiet addiction, just like you don't feel right until you have this thing."
26:04;26:09;"And so I do like that now, you know, you know how it is spending a lot of time on the road."
26:09;26:15;"I like that more often than not you're starting to see hotel rooms that have the little Nespresso thing in there."
26:15;26:21;"Because, you know, I think maybe when I was younger or something I could wake up and be like, all right, I just woke up in Minneapolis,"
26:21;26:24;"had a great night at Sneaky Pete's last night and made some new friends."
26:24;26:30;"And I'm like, I'm going to go downstairs and walk around the neighborhood until I find a cool little local coffee shop."
26:30;26:34;"But now that I'm a little bit older, I'm just like, you know, wake up just like fumbling for the--"
26:34;26:36;"I like not having to leave the room."
26:36;26:40;"So I think Nespresso, you know, it saves me time and it's classy."
26:40;26:43;"And you get to imagine George Clooney's nice skin."
26:43;26:46;"Yeah, just a little taste of what it must be like to be him."
26:46;26:49;"We just started carrying a coffee case."
26:49;26:54;"Like we had De Marco, De Marzacco, one of those awesome Italian--"
26:54;26:55;"Oh, like the Nespresso machines."
26:55;27:02;"Yeah, they gave us one and we built this huge road case because there are some Java hounds, as you described."
27:02;27:05;"We got a few Java hounds on the case on the tour."
27:05;27:07;"And it's been really fun."
27:07;27:12;"Like I said, I can only have one a day, but there's a lot of coffee nerding going on on tour."
27:12;27:13;"It's fun."
27:13;27:16;"It seems like you feel more connected to weed than to coffee."
27:16;27:21;"Yeah, I mean, I think I got real excited about weed when I started smoking it starting--"
27:21;27:25;"I think it was February 14, 2003, like way after high school."
27:25;27:26;"Wait, Valentine's Day?"
27:26;27:31;"Yeah, me and my best friend Trevor and Brad, they got me stoned for the first time on Valentine's Day."
27:31;27:33;"And I'll love them forever."
27:33;27:36;"2020 is actually Valentine's Day."
27:36;27:38;"Yeah, baby, love yourself."
27:38;27:43;"There's a stain on my notebook where your coffee cup was"
27:43;27:52;"Oh, there's ash in the pages now I've got myself lost"
27:52;28:00;"I was writing to tell you that my feelings tonight"
28:04;28:09;"You're a stain on my notebook that brings your goodbye"
28:09;28:20;"Oh, now she's gone and I'm back on the beat"
28:20;28:29;"A stain on my notebook says nothing to me"
28:30;28:38;"Oh, now she's gone and I'm out with her friend"
28:38;28:49;"Her lips full of passion, coffee in bed"
28:49;28:53;"I think another reason why I've always had a good impression of you,"
28:53;28:57;"despite us only meeting zero to two times,"
28:57;29:01;"obviously, goes without saying, you know, great musician, great songwriter,"
29:01;29:05;"with a lot of depth and sensitivity in your music."
29:05;29:08;"But I always had this impression, probably just from something that I read,"
29:08;29:10;"that you were like a big jock in high school."
29:10;29:15;"And maybe because I grew up in a small town that had like a lot of athletes and stuff,"
29:15;29:21;"there's nothing that I admire more than the sensitive musical athlete type."
29:21;29:24;"Everybody knows the stereotype of like the mean jock,"
29:24;29:27;"everybody knows the stereotype of like the kind of sensitive artsy person."
29:27;29:29;"And I'm like, I don't really like either one of you."
29:29;29:33;"I like, I like, I kind of remember there was this older dude at my school that,"
29:33;29:35;"I don't even know what he played, he's like some kind of soccer star."
29:35;29:38;"And I just remember somebody said to me like, you know, he likes a neutral milk hotel."
29:38;29:42;"And I was, and I just remember being like, that's tight, man."
29:42;29:44;"That's a Renaissance man right there."
29:44;29:47;"So I don't know, obviously I'm fantasizing way too much, but."
29:47;29:52;"No, I mean, I was that kid. I was, I loved my high school situation."
29:52;29:55;"And it's taken me years to actually look back and be like, wow,"
29:55;29:58;"it probably wasn't that good for just about anybody at my school."
29:58;30:00;"I just was really lucky."
30:00;30:01;"Cause you were the middle of the Venn diagram."
30:01;30:04;"I really was. I lived in the country, but I had friends that lived, you know,"
30:04;30:06;"in the third ward. So I'd go visit them."
30:06;30:09;"I was, you know, one of the captains of the varsity football team."
30:09;30:11;"So you straight up played football."
30:11;30:12;"Captain, baby."
30:12;30:14;"So what position do you play?"
30:14;30:15;"Tight end."
30:15;30:17;"My parents never would have let me play football."
30:17;30:18;"Yeah."
30:18;30:19;"Yeah. They were like terrified of football."
30:19;30:21;"Were you getting like concussions and stuff?"
30:21;30:24;"I did get a couple of concussions during high school football games."
30:24;30:25;"Yeah."
30:25;30:28;"So basically in high school you were captain of the football team,"
30:28;30:32;"not smoking weed. Is it because you took your sport seriously?"
30:32;30:34;"Yeah. We had the athletic code."
30:34;30:37;"And as a matter of fact, I would yell at my buddies for like breaking the code."
30:37;30:38;"Really?"
30:38;30:39;"Yeah."
30:39;30:40;"You're a little bit of a narc?"
30:40;30:41;"A little bit of a narc."
30:41;30:45;"I wouldn't talent anyone, but it was like, come on dudes, keep it clean."
30:45;30:47;"Oh, well that's kind of cool actually."
30:47;30:48;"Yeah."
30:48;30:49;"No, that's noble because yeah."
30:49;30:51;"If you told the coach that would make you a narc,"
30:51;30:53;"but if you just said like, hey, we're doing this, let's do it well."
30:53;30:58;"I actually kind of believed in not just following the rules, but like, yeah."
30:58;31:03;"It's like, I think this will make you a better player if you're not totally f***** up all the time."
31:03;31:06;"Although, isn't there a thing some people like to get high and run?"
31:06;31:07;"That doesn't make sense to me."
31:07;31:08;"Oh, it doesn't?"
31:08;31:09;"Mm-mm."
31:09;31:11;"As I say it out loud, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me either."
31:11;31:13;"It's like if you start running and you see like a rabbit in the field,"
31:13;31:16;"I'll just stop running and just look at the rabbit."
31:16;31:17;"Right."
31:17;31:21;"So you weren't really smoking weed and I imagine during the season you wouldn't be drinking either."
31:21;31:24;"I never drank in high school until like the very, very end, yeah."
31:24;31:29;"And I'm sure like all American high schools, let alone Wisconsin, a very beer type state,"
31:29;31:31;"there probably were a lot of keggers."
31:31;31:34;"It seemed like everybody was doing it, yeah."
31:34;31:40;"I had just enough groups of friends like in the athletic and music program was really special at our high school."
31:40;31:43;"We just had incredible educators and incredible resources."
31:43;31:47;"I had four classes in the music department my senior year."
31:47;31:49;"And what is it, Eau Claire High School?"
31:49;31:50;"Eau Claire Memorial High School, yeah."
31:50;31:53;"There's a couple of high schools in town, but that was Southside."
31:53;31:58;"So you're captain of the football team, telling the other guys, ""Don't smoke weed."
31:58;31:59;"It's against the code of conduct."""
31:59;32:02;"And then you're like playing Indigo Girls in the locker room."
32:02;32:04;"Well, they wouldn't let me do that."
32:04;32:09;"I would be listening to Ricky Lee Jones' Indigo Girls like on the way to the game and on the way back."
32:09;32:10;"Wait, how old are you?"
32:10;32:11;"I'm 38."
32:11;32:12;"So you were three years old."
32:12;32:13;"I was class of '99."
32:13;32:14;"Okay."
32:14;32:15;"I was class of 2002."
32:15;32:16;"Okay."
32:16;32:19;"Okay, so class of '99, you're a senior in high school listening to Ricky Lee Jones and Indigo Girls."
32:19;32:23;"That's like peak new metal, especially for like football players."
32:23;32:24;"Yeah."
32:24;32:27;"So I bet probably a lot of people were like blasting Limp Bizkit."
32:27;32:28;"Cold Chamber."
32:28;32:29;"Yeah."
32:29;32:30;"That was a big one."
32:30;32:31;"I would bring some of the stuff I liked."
32:31;32:35;"Like I like Napalm Death and Brutal Truth, and so I'd get that in there."
32:35;32:38;"But then ultimately Bizkit's going to come on."
32:38;32:39;"Yeah."
32:39;32:40;"What's your favorite Limp Bizkit song?"
32:40;32:41;"Oh, Jesus."
32:41;32:43;"I don't think I could name one actually."
32:43;32:44;"Going 'Round the Clock."
32:44;32:45;"Is that one?"
32:45;32:48;"Going 'Round the Clock."
32:48;32:49;"I don't think so."
32:49;32:50;"I just was wildly guessing there."
32:50;32:51;"It could be."
32:51;32:56;"To me, the best Limp Bizkit songs are, well, there was that DJ Premier produced one with"
32:56;32:57;"Method Man."
32:57;32:58;"That was kind of good."
32:58;33:03;"And then of like the heavy ones, I think the best was I'm Like a Chainsaw, Asking Your"
33:03;33:04;"Ass Raw."
33:04;33:05;"It's called Break Stuff."
33:05;33:08;"I probably listened to it in the old locker room."
33:08;33:11;"It's just one of those days where you don't want to wake up."
33:11;33:12;"Everything is f***ing f***ing up."
33:12;33:13;"Everybody sucks."
33:13;33:16;"You don't really know why, but you want to justify."
33:16;33:18;"And someone's head off."
33:18;33:19;"No human contact."
33:19;33:22;"And if you went to act, your life is on contract."
33:22;33:25;"Your best bet is to stay away, motherf***er."
33:25;33:27;"It's just one of those days."
33:27;33:31;"It's all about the he says, she says, bulls***."
33:31;33:34;"I think you better quit, and f***ing slip."
33:34;33:36;"Or you're gonna leave me with a fat lip."
33:36;33:40;"It's all about the he says, she says, bulls***."
33:40;33:43;"I think you better quit, and f***ing slip."
33:43;33:44;"Does that sound familiar?"
33:44;33:45;"No."
33:45;33:50;"I feel like Wisconsin, all northern states are very heavy."
33:50;33:51;"Yeah, a lot of it."
33:51;33:55;"Like more on the east coast, when you get to upstate New York, it has very little to"
33:55;33:59;"do with the cosmopolitan elitism of the Manhattanites."
33:59;34:00;"I don't know what they want."
34:00;34:02;"How does that manifest in what music people listen to?"
34:02;34:04;"Well, there's a lot of heavy stuff."
34:04;34:06;"Like Earth Crisis, do you remember?"
34:06;34:07;"They're a hardcore band."
34:07;34:12;"They're from upstate New York, and there used to be a kind of like metal/hardcore, just"
34:12;34:16;"like heavy festival way up upstate New York called Hellfest."
34:16;34:20;"I just remember kind of reading about that and just being like, whoa."
34:20;34:21;"It's a heavy choice."
34:21;34:22;"Up north."
34:22;34:25;"Up north things are intense."
34:25;34:28;"And I feel like Wisconsin seems like kind of like metal country too."
34:28;34:31;"Yeah, well, you said country too, and it's also country."
34:31;34:35;"Like the world's biggest country music fest is in my hometown."
34:35;34:36;"Really?"
34:36;34:40;"Yeah, I don't think it is anymore, but for a long time it was the largest selling country"
34:40;34:41;"music festival."
34:41;34:42;"It makes no sense."
34:42;34:43;"Yeah, maybe I don't have a full impression."
34:43;34:48;"I mean, I guess probably do a lot of people, they associate you with Eau Claire, but before"
34:48;34:52;"Bon Iver was popping, there's a country music fest there."
34:52;34:56;"Were there like farm kids going to Eau Claire Regional High School or whatever?"
34:56;34:57;"Yeah, definitely."
34:57;34:59;"Definitely a lot of farm kids."
34:59;35:02;"I mean, I was living out by them and I went to a really..."
35:02;35:03;"You're not a farm kid?"
35:03;35:05;"My mom was a farm kid, but we didn't have a farm."
35:05;35:06;"You're half farm kid."
35:06;35:07;"Half farm."
35:07;35:08;"Yeah."
35:08;35:11;"50% farm, 50% Michigan guy."
35:11;35:13;"And what, big city Michigan?"
35:13;35:15;"My dad grew up like outside Jackson."
35:15;35:16;"Jackson, Michigan?"
35:16;35:17;"Yeah."
35:17;35:21;"Dude, my dad has lived within a mile of I-94 his entire life."
35:21;35:23;"He's like 69 years old."
35:23;35:24;"Really?"
35:24;35:25;"I-94?"
35:25;35:29;"Chicago, Jackson, all these places, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Hudson, Eau Claire."
35:29;35:31;"Kind of a weird stat."
35:31;35:33;"I grew up on 95 corridor."
35:33;35:34;"One more."
35:34;35:36;"One more number."
35:36;35:37;"Yeah."
35:37;35:38;"Just one different."
35:38;35:39;"Yeah."
35:39;35:42;"And then so you sing, there's this like great music program at the school."
35:42;35:44;"Is there a crunchy side to Eau Claire?"
35:44;35:45;"Like granola?"
35:45;35:46;"Like..."
35:46;35:47;"Yeah."
35:48;35:49;"I mean, we went to some fish shows."
35:49;35:50;"And there were hippies there."
35:50;35:51;"Yeah."
35:51;35:55;"You just can't call them full blown hippies though."
35:55;35:58;"Because there's always something missing from the full identity."
35:58;36:00;"You know, because you'd never seen the ocean."
36:00;36:01;"You've never served."
36:01;36:05;"You've just had hemp necklaces and listened to like fish at Madison Square Garden."
36:05;36:06;"You know what I mean?"
36:06;36:09;"So in a way, it's like, it's not like that's not cool."
36:09;36:12;"But in a way we were all like, at least my group of friends,"
36:12;36:16;"and I'd say for the most part, nobody was all one thing."
36:16;36:20;"Like it was really rare to see just a metalhead or like just a hippie."
36:20;36:26;"They would have to be trying really, really hard to like identify as an identifiable thing."
36:26;36:28;"What about the older generation?"
36:28;36:31;"Is Eau Claire the type of place that a Midwestern hippie might end up"
36:31;36:34;"and then raise their kids to send them to that high school?"
36:34;36:38;"Yeah, they probably wouldn't end up-- they wouldn't go there as a hippie."
36:38;36:39;"Yeah."
36:39;36:42;"You might turn into one while you're there just because everyone's nice"
36:42;36:44;"and you'd be encouraged to be yourself."
36:44;36:47;"But so it sounds like there's something for everyone."
36:47;36:48;"Yeah."
36:48;36:49;"In Eau Claire."
36:49;36:50;"Maybe."
36:50;36:53;"I feel like one time we stopped there on tour not to play."
36:53;36:54;"We've never played there."
36:54;36:56;"We must have just been like driving one day."
36:56;36:59;"And I feel like there was like a food co-op there."
36:59;37:01;"There's like a crunchy health food store."
37:01;37:03;"Yeah, yeah, we're working on it."
37:03;37:05;"But this was like 10 years ago."
37:05;37:08;"Yeah, I mean it's for-- I mean everyone's like--"
37:08;37:11;"Wisconsin's America's dairy land, like it's on a license plate."
37:11;37:16;"But I find it pretty embarrassing that we have almost no like food to table culture."
37:16;37:17;"Yeah."
37:17;37:22;"A lot of our food is going to Cisco and American Indian American Foods"
37:22;37:23;"and all these places."
37:23;37:24;"So that's been a bit of a bummer."
37:24;37:27;"And actually there's towns that are smaller than ours that are doing a much better job."
37:27;37:28;"Yeah, so what do you have in Eau Claire?"
37:28;37:32;"We just have like one little co-op and a couple CSAs that are popping up here and there."
37:32;37:33;"Yeah."
37:33;37:34;"But it's hard."
37:34;37:35;"You mean you got a--"
37:35;37:36;"There's Chipotle?"
37:36;37:37;"Yeah, we do got one."
37:37;37:38;"It's good."
37:38;37:39;"You hit it often?"
37:39;37:40;"Maybe once a month."
37:40;37:41;"Yeah."
37:41;37:42;"Getting the car washed or something."
37:42;37:44;"Is there like an artisanal coffee shop?"
37:44;37:45;"There's a couple now."
37:45;37:46;"There's Starbucks?"
37:46;37:47;"There's definitely Starbucks."
37:47;37:48;"Yeah."
37:48;37:51;"Matter of fact, until a year ago, it was still the best iced latte in town."
37:51;37:52;"That's what I'd always tell people."
37:52;37:57;"There's a guy who is named Winter who's kind of part of the extended time crisis family."
37:57;37:59;"And he's the pioneer of something called Starbucking,"
37:59;38:01;"which is just going as many Starbucks as you can."
38:01;38:04;"And he recently hit 15,000."
38:04;38:05;"Whoa."
38:05;38:09;"One interesting thing about it is that it's a Sisyphean task"
38:09;38:14;"because it's impossible to hit every Starbucks because they open like 60 a week in China."
38:14;38:18;"So, you know, you can never win at Starbucking, but it's like a lifestyle."
38:18;38:19;"Yeah."
38:19;38:21;"Since Winter's become more a part of the show,"
38:21;38:26;"and we recently saw him when we were in New York and he came to the Vampire Weekend show,"
38:26;38:28;"I found myself going to Starbucks a little bit more."
38:28;38:29;"Yeah."
38:29;38:34;"I mean, at the end of the day, it's like if you start trying to make a huge difference"
38:34;38:39;"between like the McDonald's, Starbucks, and then like Fazoli's,"
38:39;38:41;"you're not going to get very far."
38:41;38:45;"It's like it's pretty much the same bullsh*t coming off the same truck."
38:45;38:49;"And the reality is, is like Starbucks has really good coffee."
38:49;38:52;"If you want coffee, you can go to Starbucks and get a good one."
38:52;38:53;"It's solid."
38:53;38:54;"Yeah, it's solid."
38:54;38:59;"And also, it's been disappointing that some of these places that represented the post-Starbucks wave,"
38:59;39:03;"say Blue Bottle, a La Cologne, they got bought up by giant companies too,"
39:03;39:06;"and they start popping up like Starbucks, and then you really get confused."
39:06;39:07;"Mm-hmm."
39:07;39:09;"I was trying to support small business, man."
39:09;39:11;"It's really hard to do that."
39:11;39:13;"I at least want to know what's going on."
39:13;39:14;"I don't want to be tricked."
39:14;39:16;"Yeah, it feels like we're getting tricked constantly."
39:16;39:17;"Yeah."
39:17;39:18;"They got Tim Hortons around there?"
39:18;39:21;"No, you got to go north of the border for Timmy's."
39:21;39:24;"Okay, so you called it Timmy's, so you're familiar with it."
39:24;39:27;"I've spent some serious years in Canada."
39:27;39:29;"Well, because how far is the border?"
39:29;39:30;"It's actually like six hours."
39:30;39:31;"Oh, it's not close."
39:31;39:33;"It's not close, but closer than--"
39:33;39:36;"But you just spend time in Canada as a musician, or--"
39:36;39:39;"I had a couple of relationships that brought me up north of the border."
39:39;39:40;"Oh, really?"
39:40;39:43;"So New York and LA were never even a question."
39:43;39:45;"You were looking at real estate in Calgary."
39:45;39:49;"I was not looking at real estate, but I was definitely in Montreal a lot, and Toronto."
39:49;39:50;"Okay, great towns."
39:50;39:51;"They are great towns."
39:51;39:55;"Toronto's actually south of Eau Claire, if you can believe that."
39:55;39:56;"Think about it."
39:56;39:57;"Oh, wow."
39:57;40:01;"It's like Minneapolis is like north of Toronto, about the same as Montreal."
40:01;40:03;"So what's your relationship to the cold?"
40:03;40:06;"Are you allowed to complain about it when you live in Eau Claire?"
40:06;40:08;"If you don't, you're an asshole."
40:08;40:09;"If you don't complain about it--"
40:09;40:10;"You're lying."
40:11;40:12;"Because this is a question I've had."
40:12;40:16;"I've always been-- well, again, it's not a place as intense as northern Wisconsin,"
40:16;40:22;"but being in New York and then going to LA, and there's this whole stupid New York versus LA thing,"
40:22;40:26;"which I've always felt like was just a very kind of narcissistic conversation."
40:26;40:27;"Pretty insular."
40:27;40:29;"Yeah, very insular."
40:29;40:31;"But a lot of what people talk about is the weather,"
40:31;40:35;"and I always kind of just felt like, ""Eh, it's winter. It's cold."""
40:35;40:37;"And then people have said, ""Well, come on."
40:37;40:42;"You haven't done a full year in New York in a long time, so maybe you're trying to--"""
40:42;40:43;"Getting soft."
40:43;40:44;"Yeah."
40:44;40:47;"Or even when I say sometimes, ""Yeah, who cares?"""
40:47;40:48;"People are like, ""Well, you're not there, man."""
40:48;40:50;"And I can't even remember what my attitude was."
40:50;40:52;"I remember I always hated March."
40:52;40:55;"That's why it's hard, and that's why you have to complain about it."
40:55;40:56;"Because it's one month too many."
40:56;40:59;"Yeah, or like it snows in May sometimes."
40:59;41:00;"Oh, really?"
41:00;41:01;"Yeah, and then you go and pick the shovel up."
41:01;41:03;"You're just like, ""F--- this."""
41:03;41:05;"Well, what's the appropriate way to complain?"
41:05;41:08;"I guess what I'm saying is it'd be lame to be like, ""Oh, I love the cold."""
41:08;41:11;"I do love it until a point, and then it's like you have to die."
41:11;41:16;"It's like everything is dead around you, and it's almost like you go through that same process."
41:16;41:19;"And that's the part that I actually hold on to."
41:19;41:25;"Now I get to go on tour and not actually have to dredge the January through April without getting a break."
41:25;41:26;"Yeah."
41:26;41:27;"That does make it better."
41:27;41:28;"You have to shovel a lot?"
41:28;41:29;"It's bad, yeah."
41:29;41:30;"We got help."
41:30;41:33;"We got a really long driveway, so we get a little man with a truck."
41:33;41:35;"Oh, not the neighborhood kids?"
41:35;41:37;"There is no neighborhood out there."
41:37;41:38;"Oh, right."
41:38;41:41;"That seems like something fun to get high and do is shovel."
41:41;41:42;"That is true."
41:42;41:43;"Snow blow."
41:43;41:44;"You actually have a machine."
41:44;41:46;"For the sidewalks and stuff, yeah."
41:46;41:47;"Yeah."
43:08;43:11;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
43:11;43:13;"This show rules!"
43:13;43:19;"Before we talk more about your life, I wanted to bring up a few things that we talk about on this show a lot to see if they mean anything to you."
43:19;43:20;"Yeah, great."
43:20;43:21;"Richard Montanez."
43:21;43:23;"I don't know who that is."
43:23;43:25;"He invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
43:25;43:26;"Do you know his story?"
43:26;43:28;"Those are awful."
43:28;43:29;"You don't like them?"
43:29;43:30;"No."
43:30;43:31;"Okay, well, you might like his story."
43:31;43:32;"Okay."
43:32;43:33;"I'm so sorry."
43:33;43:36;"I mean, I don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings."
43:36;43:39;"No, I mean, everybody's got, you know, right to their opinion."
43:39;43:42;"I mean, he's--well, first of all, there's a film."
43:42;43:47;"It hasn't shot yet, but Eva Longoria is attached to direct called Flamin' Hot, and it's the story of his life."
43:47;43:49;"So here's the cool thing about Richard Montanez."
43:49;43:50;"Got it."
43:50;43:55;"Is that he is an immigrant from Mexico, and he's working as a janitor at Frito-Lay."
43:55;43:56;"Okay, I like this."
43:56;44:11;"And they were about to throw out a bunch of Cheetos one day, and he took them home, and he started experimenting, and he brought them back, and against all odds, you know,
people were very skeptical of the company, and basically he invented the whole Flamin' Hot family because it's not just Cheetos."
44:11;44:14;"They do Flamin' Hot Fritos, everything at Frito-Lay."
44:14;44:16;"Now he's like a major executive there."
44:16;44:18;"That's fantastic."
44:18;44:20;"It's an all-American rags-to-riches story."
44:20;44:22;"There's a lot of excitement about the film."
44:22;44:23;"Have you seen it?"
44:23;44:24;"No, no, no."
44:24;44:25;"They just announced it."
44:25;44:26;"Okay."
44:26;44:27;"I follow him on Instagram."
44:27;44:28;"It's a private Instagram."
44:28;44:29;"You have to be invited to it."
44:29;44:30;"Okay."
44:30;44:31;"You have to be allowed to."
44:31;44:32;"I'm sorry."
44:32;44:33;"I'm not trying to stunt."
44:33;44:34;"No."
44:34;44:35;"I'm not trying to stunt on you, buddy."
44:35;44:36;"That would be the dopest stunt ever."
44:36;44:40;"I mean, he has a lot of followers, but still, it's private."
44:40;44:43;"They just announced that Eva Longoria is attached, so I don't know."
44:43;44:47;"We're probably looking at like a 2023 summer release."
44:47;44:48;"Okay."
44:48;44:51;"So, yeah, I had a feeling that you'd like the story, but not a fan of the product."
44:51;44:56;"I was in Chicago working at Chance's studio, and I was like, ""I'm a little hungry."
44:56;44:59;"I'm going to walk back to the hotel with this bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos."""
44:59;45:00;"Yeah."
45:00;45:05;"And against the judgment of taking a piece of trash and putting it in a trash can, I"
45:05;45:09;"was just like, ""These don't deserve to go in the trash can."""
45:09;45:10;"I just put it-"
45:10;45:11;"On the ground?"
45:11;45:12;"I placed it on the-"
45:12;45:14;"Like, not like didn't throw it on the ground."
45:14;45:16;"I just put it directly on the ground."
45:16;45:18;"These need to stay here forever."
45:18;45:21;"Wait, because that was your first time ever having Flamin' Hot Cheetos?"
45:21;45:22;"Yeah."
45:22;45:24;"I was like, ""This has got to be good."""
45:24;45:25;"Do you like regular Cheetos?"
45:25;45:26;"Yeah."
45:26;45:27;"And do you like spicy food?"
45:27;45:28;"Yeah."
45:28;45:29;"Something's not adding up."
45:29;45:30;"Maybe Chance-"
45:30;45:32;"Maybe I got like a super tasty situation."
45:32;45:36;"Chance probably had some off-brand bullsh*t in the studio."
45:36;45:38;"Oh, man."
45:38;45:39;"Yeah."
45:39;45:42;"We have connections at Frito-Lay, so maybe we can get you sent a gift bag of the whole"
45:42;45:43;"Flamin' Hot family."
45:43;45:44;"It'd be nice and addicted to them."
45:44;45:45;"Big popcorn."
45:45;45:46;"Yeah."
45:46;45:47;"Well, maybe there's some other stuff that you'd like."
45:47;45:48;"All right."
45:48;45:49;"That's fair."
45:49;45:50;"Next question."
45:50;45:51;"What are your thoughts on Twiddle?"
45:51;45:52;"What's Twiddle?"
45:52;45:57;"Twiddle is a band that we've kind of developed a very strong relationship with over the years."
45:57;46:00;"Basically, they're a jam band from Vermont."
46:00;46:03;"Certainly inspired by Fish and the Dead."
46:03;46:08;"And they kind of originally came on our radar because they had a lot of haters in the jam"
46:08;46:09;"community."
46:09;46:14;"And I know as musicians, the idea of haters and how people react to your music and stuff,"
46:14;46:22;"because I think a lot of us get into music because it seems like a safe space to explore"
46:22;46:25;"feelings and the depth of your soul and stuff."
46:25;46:28;"But then, of course, being a professional musician is the opposite."
46:28;46:30;"You're bringing a knife to a gunfight."
46:30;46:35;"So anyway, I think I always instinctually feel a little bit when I see somebody getting hated"
46:35;46:36;"on, like, what's that all about?"
46:36;46:40;"And especially you think in the jam community, you think that'd be like a very kind vibe."
46:40;46:43;"And look, Twiddle absolutely has their fan base."
46:43;46:47;"So, you know, it's not like they're, you know, I saw them at the Troubadour earlier this year."
46:47;46:48;"They're out there."
46:48;46:53;"But we noticed that there were like a lot of memes and stuff and people especially being"
46:53;46:56;"harsh on this very early song of theirs called Jam Flow Man."
46:56;47:00;"And anyway, so we did this whole show once about the song Jam Flow Man."
47:00;47:03;"Then Twiddle reached out and we actually had the singer call and we found out like the"
47:03;47:05;"dude wrote the song in high school."
47:05;47:08;"So it's like even like funnier that people are going so hard on the song that he wrote"
47:08;47:09;"in high school."
47:09;47:11;"And then from there, I got to see them live."
47:11;47:13;"And actually, they're going to open a leg of our tour next year."
47:13;47:14;"Oh, wow."
47:14;47:18;"Jam Flow Man is really sinking in as an amazing song title."
47:18;47:19;"Well, I'll play you some of the song."
47:19;47:20;"And here's the thing."
47:20;47:21;"This is very early Twiddle."
47:21;47:27;"So the first thing I'll say is that the recording quality is not at the same level as their"
47:27;47:28;"later stuff."
47:28;47:32;"And I'm sure even Twiddle would say, look, people like to talk about this song a lot,"
47:32;47:33;"positively and negatively."
47:33;47:35;"For them, it's one of many, many songs."
47:35;47:36;"Gotcha."
47:36;47:37;"You know, they're a jam band."
47:37;47:40;"They, you know, they got a whole library."
47:40;47:41;"[MUSIC - JAM FLOW MAN, ""JAM""]"
47:41;47:42;"Have you heard of the Jam Flow Man?"
47:42;47:43;"Jam's sickest and the quickest, hangs in the lane."
47:43;47:44;"Got that shit down to mace."
47:44;47:45;"He'll play his jam and it won't be twice."
47:45;47:46;"No, the Jam Flow Man don't give a damn."
47:46;47:47;"Playing shows across the lane."
47:47;47:48;"Rocking out with his band."
47:48;47:49;"Playing a fat old reggae jam."
47:49;47:50;"No, the Jam Flow Man, won't you make that sound?"
47:50;47:51;"Make my body move all around."
47:51;47:52;"Twist up my body, make my body move all around."
47:58;48:19;"Twist up my body, make my body move all around."
48:19;48:45;"Twist up my body, make my body move all around."
48:45;49:14;"Twist up my body, make my body move all around."
49:14;49:15;"Twist up my body, make my body move all around."
49:29;49:55;"Twist up my body, make my body move all around."
49:55;50:02;"Twist up my body, make my body move all around."
50:02;50:07;"Twist up my body, make my body move all around."
50:07;50:11;"Twist up my body, make my body move all around."
50:11;50:14;"Twist up my body, make my body move all around."
52:11;52:14;"We felt we had a chance"
52:14;52:18;"to review the goods before we were born"
52:18;52:21;"and to invite a new game of chance."
52:21;52:30;"Absorbed in the clouds, a voice from afar said"
52:30;52:34;"""With the right device, you can make a pattern grow"
52:34;52:37;"or you can tune up your car."""
52:37;52:42;"So we stayed on the train, admiring the time"
52:42;52:47;"As the lights of the city drew near"
52:47;52:50;"We drank a little wine"
52:50;52:54;"So you're saying back then, as a, back in the high school days"
52:54;52:56;"you were into fish but not particularly the dead."
52:56;52:57;"That's more of a..."
52:57;52:59;"The dead I just got into."
52:59;53:02;"I got invited to play with Mayer and company."
53:02;53:04;"Oh yeah, so I want to ask you a question."
53:04;53:06;"What did you do with them? What song did you do?"
53:06;53:09;"Did you do a dead song? Not a Boney Bear song?"
53:09;53:11;"No, God no. We did Black Muddy River."
53:11;53:13;"Oh yeah, that's a beautiful song."
53:13;53:14;"It is a beautiful song."
53:14;53:15;"A late period dead song."
53:15;53:19;"I'm not self-deprecating, but I did not do a great job."
53:19;53:20;"I won't pull it up."
53:20;53:21;"No, yeah, don't."
53:21;53:24;"I definitely got some hate from some deadheads"
53:24;53:26;"and I was kind of like, you know what, you're right."
53:26;53:27;"We did take LSD."
53:27;53:28;"Oh really?"
53:28;53:29;"Yeah, it was great."
53:29;53:32;"But me and Mayer apparently kind of fell out of the game."
53:32;53:35;"But me and Mayer apparently kind of became one."
53:35;53:36;"Wait, because he took LSD too?"
53:36;53:37;"I don't know."
53:37;53:39;"I thought his thing was that he never took acid."
53:39;53:41;"Maybe he did, maybe he didn't."
53:41;53:43;"But John's a really nice guy and boy is he good at guitar."
53:43;53:48;"And we really kept playing guitar solos."
53:48;53:51;"And my friends are on the side of the stage"
53:51;53:53;"just like laughing and crying uncontrollably."
53:53;53:56;"Because apparently the lights were getting real hazy"
53:56;53:59;"and I guess me and John Mayer just became one thing."
53:59;54:01;"Well, that's a slow song."
54:01;54:02;"We played a couple fast ones too."
54:02;54:05;"I sort of sat in for the last half of the first set."
54:05;54:08;"You sang Black Muddy River and then--"
54:08;54:09;"Maybe Truckin' or something."
54:09;54:12;"I sang another song and definitely missed my entrance."
54:12;54:13;"It was tough."
54:13;54:15;"Well, look, you can go back to dead bootlegs."
54:15;54:17;"You find all sorts of wild stuff."
54:17;54:19;"It's part of the experience."
54:19;54:22;"It's always high stakes when you come up for a handful of songs"
54:22;54:24;"with somebody else."
54:24;54:26;"Monitors aren't dialed in."
54:26;54:27;"It's very bewildering."
54:27;54:30;"I sat in with The Roots once."
54:30;54:31;"Oh, yeah."
54:31;54:32;"With Quest."
54:32;54:33;"Just spit a verse."
54:33;54:35;"Just--no, I mean--no."
54:35;54:37;"We actually did something that was really successful."
54:37;54:40;"We did one of my songs before the show,"
54:40;54:42;"and it was fun and we rehearsed it."
54:42;54:44;"And then when it gets to time for the show,"
54:44;54:47;"we're doing these 15-second, 20-second versions of tunes,"
54:47;54:49;"and I'm like, ""Yeah, I got this."""
54:49;54:50;"Yeah."
54:50;54:53;"And I just totally, totally screwed it up,"
54:53;54:56;"every single one that I was supposed to do some lead line on."
54:56;54:57;"Yeah."
54:57;54:59;"And then, you know, Amir's got that little microphone"
54:59;55:01;"that he just talks to the musicians."
55:01;55:03;"Oh, just straight to the musicians."
55:03;55:05;"And he's just like, ""What was that all about?"""
55:05;55:06;"[laughter]"
55:06;55:08;"I was just like, ""I can't do this anymore."""
55:08;55:10;"It's tough when you have one shot, because, yeah,"
55:10;55:13;"when you're on tour, you're playing songs many nights,"
55:13;55:15;"and it kind of becomes muscle memory,"
55:15;55:17;"and you feel way more confident."
55:17;55:19;"There is that feeling of, like, nailing something in soundcheck,"
55:19;55:21;"and then you have this one shot, and you just, like, tense up."
55:21;55:22;"Yep."
55:22;55:23;"And you miss it."
55:23;55:24;"Yeah."
55:24;55:25;"What dead have you been getting into?"
55:25;55:27;"I've been getting into a lot on this show, too."
55:27;55:30;"'77, I think it's Cornell, New York."
55:30;55:32;"Oh, yeah, the very famous show."
55:32;55:33;"Ooh."
55:33;55:34;"Yeah."
55:34;55:35;"Damn."
55:35;55:36;"And then Europe '72 is pretty sparkly."
55:36;55:37;"Right."
55:37;55:38;"Those are probably my two favorites right now."
55:38;55:39;"Yeah."
55:39;55:40;"Do you have, like, favorite songs?"
55:40;55:41;"No."
55:41;55:42;"I really am just--"
55:42;55:44;"You really like the live-- you like hearing the live--"
55:44;55:47;"I like it when things change, and how weird Kreutzmann is on drums,"
55:47;55:50;"and how kind of, like, unimportant Mickey Hart is,"
55:50;55:54;"and yet he's just constantly whacking every beat of every drum"
55:54;55:55;"he has in front of him."
55:55;55:58;"But it's just like you're, like, rooting for them."
55:58;56:01;"You're like, they're not doing super well."
56:01;56:05;"And then all of a sudden you're like, how in the hell did they get out of that so smoothly?"
56:05;56:06;"Right, it came together."
56:06;56:07;"It's an awesome thing."
56:07;56:11;"Yeah, Jerry Lyne just jumps out that's, like, sounds composed."
56:11;56:12;"Yep."
56:12;56:13;"So perfect."
56:13;56:16;"One thing that I like about The Dead is that it's neither one nor the other."
56:16;56:21;"You can go deep into the versions and hear some, like, super long, you know,"
56:21;56:24;"the 20-minute playing in the band and see what happens and how they came back"
56:24;56:27;"and all that stuff, which is an amazing tradition."
56:27;56:33;"But then I do think as, like, songwriters, you know, even Robert Hunter as a lyricist,"
56:33;56:37;"there's something about that that, you know, you can get into it the same way"
56:37;56:38;"when you're, like, listening to Dylan or something."
56:38;56:42;"Like, really-- they have, like, such a specific lyrical world and songwriting world."
56:42;56:45;"And then when you put the improvisatory live side, it's like, forget about it."
56:45;56:48;"You could luxury in either one of those worlds."
56:48;56:51;"I really, really don't like to use the word visionary very much"
56:51;56:55;"because I think it's a dangerous-- genius is a dangerous concept, too,"
56:55;56:59;"but they are truly one of the few bands that were visionaries."
56:59;57:00;"I really, really mean that."
57:00;57:04;"I mean, you get Coltrane's Quartet and, like, Bitches Bruera, Miles."
57:04;57:06;"Like, that's all visionary [bleep]"
57:06;57:08;"and The Grateful Dead's absolutely up there."
57:08;57:12;"And it's also interesting to think, to me, too, that I can imagine in the early days"
57:12;57:18;"there were other artists who probably came out with, you know,"
57:18;57:24;"to use the language of the marketplace, stronger brand identities."
57:24;57:27;"Because I can just picture, like, you know, famously their set at Woodstock"
57:27;57:29;"wasn't very good or they didn't feel very good about it."
57:29;57:30;"The Dead."
57:30;57:32;"Yeah, so just imagine-- you're, like, looking at that group of people,"
57:32;57:36;"kind of a motley crew, and their music is one of those things"
57:36;57:39;"where truly the total is greater than the sum of its parts."
57:39;57:42;"And then you compare them to some of their contemporaries, Jefferson Airplane"
57:42;57:45;"or Hendrix or The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, you know,"
57:45;57:46;"who they played with at Altamont."
57:46;57:50;"People just had, like, from the jump, just, like, these very rock star identities,"
57:50;57:53;"like, strong brands, whereas The Dead, you know--"
57:53;57:56;"and I think partially why sometimes it takes people a long time to get into them"
57:56;58:00;"is because you could open the wrong door and you don't see it."
58:00;58:03;"Like, the first time-- I always liked The Dead's greatest hits,"
58:03;58:06;"and I, you know, I probably, like, grew up with some somewhat similar environment"
58:06;58:09;"where, you know, there'd just always be somebody whose older brother was, like,"
58:09;58:12;"a Deadhead and Linta Fish or Dave Matthews Band."
58:12;58:15;"So, you know, I would hear Uncle John's Band, and it was a great song."
58:15;58:16;"Excellent."
58:16;58:19;"So I would always be, like, right about to go be like,"
58:19;58:21;"I like The Grateful Dead songs, and I always be like--"
58:21;58:23;"and I hear there's something really special about the live recordings."
58:23;58:27;"And then the first live record I happened to find at a yard sale"
58:27;58:30;"was the one that people called ""Steal Your Face."""
58:30;58:33;"It's got the ""Steal Your Face"" logo on the front."
58:33;58:35;"And it's widely regarded as, like, one of their worst live records."
58:35;58:37;"I found Europe '72 would have been so different."
58:37;58:40;"So I'm, like, listening to it, and I'm just like, ""I think I'm a studio guy, man."""
58:40;58:42;"I just didn't get it."
58:42;58:45;"And I think also, you know, if you would hear just, like,"
58:45;58:48;"them doing, like, a pretty straightforward Merle Haggard tune,"
58:48;58:50;"I could imagine somebody listening to that would be like, ""Okay."""
58:50;58:54;"And then they do, like, kind of a reggae-ish song, and then they do, like, a blues."
58:54;58:56;"And you're like, ""Okay."""
58:56;59:01;"Again, like, the brand over decades became something so much more interesting"
59:01;59:05;"and bigger than probably even some people who came out, like, stronger out of the gate."
59:05;59:06;"Totally."
59:06;59:09;"So I do think it's, like, one of those things where it's, like--"
59:09;59:11;"it can be hard to describe what it is."
59:11;59:12;"It's not shiny."
59:12;59:15;"Like you said, it's not out of the gate, the Rolling Stones."
59:15;59:19;"I mean, they literally--you know, like, and the Beatles' haircuts or whatever."
59:19;59:21;"They didn't shine it up."
59:21;59:24;"But on the other hand, they have the best logo and the best band name."
59:24;59:25;"Yeah."
59:25;59:27;"Think how bad of a band name the Beatles is."
59:27;59:28;"It's pretty bad."
59:28;59:29;"It's horrid."
59:29;59:30;"Yeah."
59:30;59:31;"It doesn't matter."
59:31;59:35;"But I think that they just did not care about outward facing"
59:35;59:38;"and, you know, the idea of the Grateful Dead."
59:38;59:40;"It's like there is no death."
59:40;59:42;"There is only--you know, like, it's just--"
59:42;59:46;"to hear Jerry talk about that a little bit, I think it's just brilliant."
59:46;59:48;"And the fact that they don't care--"
59:48;59:51;"they were caring about bigger things like building their own sound system"
59:51;59:53;"and tracking all of their shows."
59:53;59:57;"So I think, you know, if you get caught up in trying to do your own brand for too long,"
59:57;59:59;"you are going to [bleep] it up really bad, I think."
59:59;01:00:00;"Right."

01:00:08;01:00:16;"♪ And the hot sun chills me to the bone ♪"
01:00:16;01:00:24;"♪ When I can't hear the song for the sun ♪"

01:01:02;01:01:05;"Where are you finding touring these days?"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"Oh, thank you for asking me a question."
01:01:06;01:01:07;"Yeah."
01:01:07;01:01:08;"That helps things move."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"You know, I was just like--I was so tired."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"Yeah, we should talk about touring."
01:01:12;01:01:14;"You should go talk to Ezra. You guys are in a weird zone."
01:01:14;01:01:16;"Well, that's one connection we've always had."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"We have the same booking agent."
01:01:17;01:01:21;"We were two of the early artists working with our man Adam."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"Yeah."
01:01:22;01:01:25;"I used to think I hated touring because, like I said,"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"full studio guy."
01:01:27;01:01:28;"Yeah."
01:01:28;01:01:29;"And not even in, like, a cool way."
01:01:29;01:01:31;"Like, when I hear about your compound in Wisconsin,"
01:01:31;01:01:35;"it just seems, like, cool, like, very, like, creative environment"
01:01:35;01:01:36;"and experimentation and stuff."
01:01:36;01:01:38;"Like, I want to get to that place in my life."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"But I even just mean just as a fan."
01:01:40;01:01:43;"I was just kind of like, I enjoy studio recordings."
01:01:43;01:01:45;"This is the art form that I'm familiar with,"
01:01:45;01:01:49;"and touring is like a weird, necessary evil promotional thing."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"Yeah."
01:01:50;01:01:52;"And so for the first three albums, you know, we'd go out"
01:01:52;01:01:54;"and we'd just play stuff as is."
01:01:54;01:01:56;"We'd try to just make it sound like the record"
01:01:56;01:01:57;"and just kind of get through it."
01:01:57;01:02:00;"And also another thing--actually, I remember talking about this with you."
01:02:00;01:02:02;"We have met."
01:02:02;01:02:06;"I remember talking about this with you because you sing falsetto a lot, famously."
01:02:06;01:02:11;"And I jump up to falsetto here and there in my kind of Yelpy way."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"And we have one or two songs where I'm up there a lot."
01:02:13;01:02:16;"But in the early days, once or twice I lost my voice,"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"and I was so terrified by it."
01:02:18;01:02:21;"And I was at that place in, you know, 2010 when, you know,"
01:02:21;01:02:24;"I'm also kind of like so bored of being on tour,"
01:02:24;01:02:25;"between a rock and a hard place."
01:02:25;01:02:29;"I'm like, A, if I get stressed out about my voice, I want to die"
01:02:29;01:02:33;"because if you wake up in the morning and your voice isn't there, it's terrifying."
01:02:33;01:02:36;"You have 10 hours of waiting there and waiting and waiting and being in pain."
01:02:36;01:02:39;"And one time--this is the worst thing ever--one time in Seattle,"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"I thought I could do it."
01:02:41;01:02:44;"We even did some little session earlier in the day."
01:02:44;01:02:47;"And I was like, Oh, my voice is a little crunchy, but, you know, a little crackly."
01:02:47;01:02:48;"We'll get through it."
01:02:48;01:02:50;"And then right before it's supposed to go on,"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"a few thousand people out in a beautiful park in Seattle."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"I'm like, Ah! I just realized I couldn't do it."
01:02:54;01:02:57;"Somebody had to go out on stage and be like--opening bands already played--"
01:02:57;01:02:58;"just like, Hey, guys."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"And I was sitting backstage here, everybody like booing."
01:03:00;01:03:03;"And we went back and tried to make it up, but, you know, it was brutal."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"So those things are very traumatizing."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"But, you know, when I think about, you know, the Sneaky Pete's days,"
01:03:07;01:03:10;"I was in this funny place where I'm like, on the one hand,"
01:03:10;01:03:14;"I'm terrified of losing my voice, that I would do anything to take care of it."
01:03:14;01:03:20;"But then on the other hand, I find the touring so--it's high stakes and stressful,"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"but it's also low stakes and boring."
01:03:22;01:03:26;"So there's also that part of me that just wants to go slam a couple brews at Sneaky Pete's,"
01:03:26;01:03:28;"which I know is not going to help for my voice."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"So I remember I was talking to you."
01:03:29;01:03:30;"I was like, You can drink."
01:03:30;01:03:32;"And then the next night, you're just up there singing falsetto."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"And I think you were just like, Yeah."
01:03:34;01:03:36;"Yeah, I mean, recently I finally got to a place--"
01:03:36;01:03:40;"and actually I've just come from a smoking cessation therapy thing."
01:03:40;01:03:41;"Oh, hypnosis?"
01:03:41;01:03:44;"As of like an hour and a half ago, I'll never smoke a cigarette again, which is really strange."
01:03:44;01:03:45;"Good for you."
01:03:45;01:03:48;"But the--you know, like lately, I just--it doesn't really matter."
01:03:48;01:03:53;"Like, you just have to have the right attitude, and you have to be happy with what you're doing, you know."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"I don't know. I was just curious where you were at with it,"
01:03:54;01:03:59;"because after a while, you can start to enjoy it, and it's not just about redoing yourself."
01:03:59;01:04:00;"Now I enjoy it."
01:04:00;01:04:05;"I think in the early days, I didn't have a vision for touring."
01:04:05;01:04:09;"I associated it with stress and worrying about my voice."
01:04:09;01:04:12;"So it kind of just seemed like going out and like torturing yourself for a year."
01:04:12;01:04:16;"And I also had this feeling too of like working so hard on the records,"
01:04:16;01:04:20;"every little detail about the lyrics and the sounds and everything."
01:04:20;01:04:25;"And I'd always feel like we laid it all out on the field, we left it all out on the field,"
01:04:25;01:04:29;"and then we'd be fully exhausted when the album came out,"
01:04:29;01:04:34;"or at least I'd feel fully exhausted creatively, everything empty."
01:04:34;01:04:36;"And now suit up."
01:04:36;01:04:40;"So there's always something about that that just felt like getting like, you know,"
01:04:40;01:04:42;"running out of the house in the horror movie."
01:04:42;01:04:44;"Like you finally made it out of the house, then you get hit by a truck."
01:04:44;01:04:45;"That's how I always felt."
01:04:45;01:04:49;"I did not feel prepared. I needed to go like rest for three months."
01:04:49;01:04:50;"Now it's a few things."
01:04:50;01:04:56;"We have more people on stage, which I think always feels, and you always have a lot of, you got a big crew."
01:04:56;01:05:01;"There's just something about that just makes everything feel cozier, more fun, more of a family kind of environment."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"Less alone."
01:05:02;01:05:03;"Yeah, less alone."
01:05:03;01:05:06;"You're not affected by like the attention that you're getting."
01:05:06;01:05:07;"Yeah."
01:05:07;01:05:08;"Lead singer or."
01:05:08;01:05:09;"Right."
01:05:09;01:05:11;"You can step back and let other people musically doing their thing."
01:05:11;01:05:17;"And also, I think we just reached a tipping point with a fourth album where the body of work is big enough"
01:05:17;01:05:21;"that we can switch up the set list every night and kind of like, be like,"
01:05:21;01:05:24;"""Oh, we haven't played that in a few shows,"" and go back to it."
01:05:24;01:05:26;"And that was just didn't feel possible on the third album."
01:05:26;01:05:30;"I think there's something about a fourth album, and that's something that we have in common."
01:05:30;01:05:31;"We're very varied in the same."
01:05:31;01:05:33;"Yeah, we actually, our first albums came out pretty close to each other."
01:05:33;01:05:34;"I think, you know what?"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"We played like a show together."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"I don't think we met."
01:05:37;01:05:40;"We played some sort of a funny South by Southwest thing."
01:05:40;01:05:41;"Did we?"
01:05:41;01:05:45;"Yeah, somewhere there has been a Vampire Weekend Bon Iver showcase."
01:05:45;01:05:46;"Like in '08."
01:05:46;01:05:47;"Yeah."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"Austin '08."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"Like BMO's pitchfork party or something?"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"There must have been something like that."
01:05:52;01:05:53;"Yeah."
01:05:53;01:05:54;"Oh."
01:05:54;01:05:55;"Yeah."
01:05:55;01:05:57;"Was it like 2 o'clock in the afternoon or something?"
01:05:57;01:05:58;"Yeah."
01:05:58;01:05:59;"That's starting to come back to me now."
01:05:59;01:06:01;"Yeah, you sat in with us."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"We did a 15-minute trucking."
01:06:02;01:06:03;"You don't remember that?"
01:06:03;01:06:04;"No, I wasn't."
01:06:04;01:06:05;"That was a good one."
01:06:05;01:06:09;"No, I'm sure we each did like a 30-minute set, just like in and out onto the next thing."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"Yeah."
01:06:10;01:06:14;"I think there's something about reaching a fourth album that just feels like it's a different"
01:06:14;01:06:15;"body of work."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"There's something like weird."
01:06:16;01:06:19;"I think the third album is actually like weirdly at low point in a way."
01:06:19;01:06:22;"Even though our third album, the release felt really good."
01:06:22;01:06:26;"There's something about touring it where it's like the bloom is off the rose."
01:06:26;01:06:27;"The first album comes out."
01:06:27;01:06:28;"Of course, that's exciting."
01:06:28;01:06:31;"Second album, if you do something different and things keep moving, even more exciting"
01:06:31;01:06:32;"in a way."
01:06:32;01:06:37;"I actually think when I think about the best years of touring, I would put the second album"
01:06:37;01:06:42;"era kind of high, even though I had a lot of stress and stuff, it still just felt good."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"Maybe there also is just something about we did it again."
01:06:44;01:06:45;"Can you believe it?"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"And then there's something about the third album that just however good you feel about"
01:06:49;01:06:53;"the music, however good the response is, that weirdly feels like a low point."
01:06:53;01:06:56;"And then there's something about the fourth album, maybe just because you're older or"
01:06:56;01:07:00;"the body of work reaches a tipping point where you're just like, this is fun again or something."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"You've described my first 10 years of this."
01:07:02;01:07:03;"Really?"
01:07:03;01:07:04;"Exactly."
01:07:04;01:07:05;"Yeah."
01:07:05;01:07:06;"So what's your version?"
01:07:06;01:07:07;"I mean, it sounds a lot like that."
01:07:07;01:07:11;"I mean, my third album, it took a long time to finish and I was in pain from how much"
01:07:11;01:07:13;"anxious feelings I was having."
01:07:13;01:07:18;"I never really had like heavy depression or anxiety, but then it came heavy."
01:07:18;01:07:23;"And in no small part due to touring and that isolation and the attention."
01:07:23;01:07:25;"I didn't do this to like get patted on the back."
01:07:25;01:07:26;"I just really liked music."
01:07:26;01:07:30;"And so you go out there and just like, this is the first time in my life I don't want"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"to meet anyone new."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"I don't want any new friends."
01:07:33;01:07:34;"I don't want any attention."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"I don't want anyone to tell me that I'm great again."
01:07:36;01:07:40;"It's all very confusing and isolating and it just hit a head."
01:07:40;01:07:44;"Well, yeah, actually I was curious about that too, because you have like a very mellow laid"
01:07:44;01:07:45;"back demeanor."
01:07:45;01:07:49;"Like I said, I've always been interested in the fact that you never went Hollywood."
01:07:49;01:07:56;"So you seem like God, like you're head screwed on straight, no kind of just like weirdo boogie"
01:07:56;01:07:57;"nights moment."
01:07:57;01:08:02;"But then at the same time, I've always been curious about that too, because I think I"
01:08:02;01:08:06;"also present as a mellow dude, but I don't identify as one."
01:08:06;01:08:10;"And I was kind of curious about like, I had this impression of you as somebody who doesn't"
01:08:10;01:08:11;"do a lot of press."
01:08:11;01:08:15;"Anytime I hear about somebody not wanting to do a lot of press, it's either because they're"
01:08:15;01:08:19;"such a superstar like Beyonce, they don't have to, or it's because somebody who has"
01:08:19;01:08:23;"like deep conflicted feelings about the nature of being a public person."
01:08:23;01:08:26;"Cause I feel like on your third album, did you do like one interview or something?"
01:08:26;01:08:27;"Yeah, just one."
01:08:27;01:08:29;"Is it because you were depressed?"
01:08:29;01:08:30;"Yeah."
01:08:30;01:08:31;"Just straight up."
01:08:31;01:08:35;"I seriously could not handle another moment of reflecting upon myself."
01:08:35;01:08:40;"Like I got love for myself and everything, but it's really hard to describe."
01:08:40;01:08:44;"And this time I said yes to a few more things because to be honest with you, I recognize"
01:08:44;01:08:50;"that, you know, when you don't do anything and you're not Beyonce, it can have real effects"
01:08:50;01:08:55;"on your small business, on your family, on the people around you that this is their job."
01:08:55;01:08:56;"Yeah."
01:08:56;01:08:58;"So that part is easy to accept."
01:08:58;01:09:02;"But even this time, you know, I've probably done 10 interviews, 15 interviews now for"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"this album and I'm trying to spread them out."
01:09:04;01:09:09;"But then like one time there was like three in one week and I swear I just started losing"
01:09:09;01:09:10;"it."
01:09:10;01:09:12;"I was like, these old feelings are back again."
01:09:12;01:09:14;"My chest is tight."
01:09:14;01:09:16;"I don't want to do this."
01:09:16;01:09:19;"Do you intellectually know what's making you feel that way?"
01:09:19;01:09:24;"Or is it like, are you scared of like being embarrassed by something you said?"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"Or is it just something it's deeper than that?"
01:09:26;01:09:30;"I think I'm far away from being embarrassed because the whole thing seems embarrassing"
01:09:30;01:09:31;"to me."
01:09:31;01:09:32;"Right."
01:09:32;01:09:34;"Like rock and roll magazines are embarrassing to me."
01:09:34;01:09:35;"Yeah."
01:09:35;01:09:40;"Like I picked them up and I learned about bands, but the whole thing seems like a big"
01:09:40;01:09:41;"weird thing."
01:09:41;01:09:42;"Right."
01:09:42;01:09:46;"So I'm not embarrassed or worried about what anybody might say about me because if they"
01:09:46;01:09:50;"say something, you know, honorable about me or something, it's just as problematic to"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"me as if they say something that would be embarrassing."
01:09:52;01:09:55;"Like I've got three legs or something."
01:09:55;01:09:56;"Yeah."
01:09:56;01:09:59;"But I think intellectually what's going on is it like when you make something, like you"
01:09:59;01:10:02;"work on it, you say, you leave it all on the field."
01:10:02;01:10:03;"You do that."
01:10:03;01:10:04;"You wrote the story."
01:10:04;01:10:05;"Yeah."
01:10:05;01:10:09;"It's like, I never understood how people can write a book and then go talk about the book"
01:10:09;01:10:10;"a lot."
01:10:10;01:10:13;"Like everything that I wanted to say is in this book."
01:10:13;01:10:17;"And so intellectually, and it's not just the wasted time thing though either."
01:10:17;01:10:21;"It was when you're going back and try to retract what you were thinking in a certain time,"
01:10:21;01:10:23;"A, you're never going to do it right."
01:10:23;01:10:24;"Right."
01:10:24;01:10:25;"You're never going to remember."
01:10:25;01:10:30;"And C, when you go over those same tracks again, there's like some kind of damage happening."
01:10:30;01:10:31;"It hurts."
01:10:31;01:10:32;"Yeah."
01:10:33;01:10:35;"I often sometimes feel like I'm lying too."
01:10:35;01:10:39;"It's a form of lying because if you're a conversationalist and you're like a good person and having"
01:10:39;01:10:42;"a talk with somebody, you're like, like we clearly are right now."
01:10:42;01:10:43;"That's right."
01:10:43;01:10:48;"But when you try to answer the same, basically the same question with the same answer, you're"
01:10:48;01:10:51;"going to make it a little different and you end up fibbing."
01:10:51;01:10:53;"You end up saying, it's not true."
01:10:53;01:10:56;"And you're not trying to lie, but that feels bad."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"Right."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"I'm not over the embarrassment phase."
01:10:59;01:11:02;"I accept a lot of the indignity of just being out there."
01:11:02;01:11:04;"And in some ways I think it's deserved."
01:11:04;01:11:08;"If I'm being real above it all, I'm like, you want a lot of people to come to your shows"
01:11:08;01:11:09;"and stuff."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"Yeah."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"You got to be okay with occasionally being misinterpreted."
01:11:12;01:11:16;"I actually just was just doing an interview where somebody said like, what do you think"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"when people call your new album happy?"
01:11:18;01:11:23;"Of course, I think, uh, I'm a complex human being and the fabric of life is a mixture"
01:11:23;01:11:27;"of happiness and sadness and every day, maybe not every moment, but certainly every day."
01:11:27;01:11:31;"And I think even on the album, there's songs that read as happy that aren't happy."
01:11:31;01:11:33;"And there's songs that are clearly not."
01:11:33;01:11:36;"So what I was just like, you know, it's not cool to be just a happy person."
01:11:36;01:11:38;"And I've never felt that way."
01:11:38;01:11:41;"And I was trying to think about it, you know, in a really calm way."
01:11:41;01:11:43;"And I was like, well, on the one hand, I'm just like, it's not true."
01:11:43;01:11:44;"Spend a little more time with it."
01:11:44;01:11:49;"You know, I wish I could explain more, but on the other hand, there's also a part of"
01:11:49;01:11:54;"me that's like, it's a form of narcissism to demand that the whole world understands"
01:11:54;01:11:55;"you perfectly too."
01:11:55;01:11:56;"Oh yeah."
01:11:56;01:12:00;"And then you feel bad about yourself that even you would want to be understood perfectly."
01:12:00;01:12:02;"You're caught between these two things."
01:12:02;01:12:04;"I want to be understood, but also you have to."
01:12:04;01:12:05;"Yeah."
01:12:05;01:12:07;"Who are you to be perfectly understood?"
01:12:07;01:12:11;"I always try to remember that it's like they might want to talk to me, but they're the"
01:12:11;01:12:14;"only reason we're sitting there is because of some music, right."
01:12:14;01:12:17;"A music song, a set of music songs."
01:12:17;01:12:18;"Yeah."
01:12:18;01:12:22;"And it's not like a self deprecating thing where like, I don't deserve to be there."
01:12:22;01:12:27;"I just, again, I don't feel like I'm maybe even the best person to talk to about it."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"You know what I mean?"
01:12:28;01:12:33;"And so, and I will say that if I'm honest, I've never been able to, even when I've had"
01:12:33;01:12:37;"a bad experience with like a journalist or write up or something, I've never been able"
01:12:37;01:12:42;"to get into that mindset of just like music journalism, because I know that my attraction"
01:12:42;01:12:45;"to music was formed by, by reading about music."
01:12:45;01:12:48;"I love to read about music and I love to talk about music and what it means."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"And I love great music journalism."
01:12:50;01:12:54;"And I do think there are times it doesn't happen frequently, but once in a while I do"
01:12:54;01:12:59;"feel like you read somebody interpreting your work and, and I'm like, you put it well, like"
01:12:59;01:13:00;"I couldn't put it like that."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"I made the thing, I said what I had to say, and then you said something different and"
01:13:03;01:13:06;"you saw something different and that's about as good as it gets."
01:13:06;01:13:09;"But oftentimes those aren't always people that you speak to."
01:13:09;01:13:13;"It's hard because you don't, in one hand, you don't want to like do the thing where"
01:13:13;01:13:18;"you're like, you're not a journalist, but there is a difference between journalism and"
01:13:18;01:13:21;"straight up just trying to like sell smut mags."
01:13:21;01:13:22;"You know what I mean?"
01:13:22;01:13:25;"Like just jammed full of stuff that's like controversial or something."
01:13:25;01:13:26;"Right."
01:13:26;01:13:29;"And that's one thing that I've noticed is that a lot of musicians and journalists are"
01:13:29;01:13:35;"actually fighting the same thing, which is the destruction of like a healthy media ecosystem."
01:13:35;01:13:39;"I'm sure some people would say it was never healthy, but it's really not healthy now."
01:13:39;01:13:43;"But the idea, I think there's a lot of journalists who feel like, I wish that I got paid"
01:13:43;01:13:48;"appropriately that I could actually like spend time to, well, like the one thing that I"
01:13:48;01:13:54;"looked at was the, the guy from Pitchfork went to your spot in Wisconsin and you know,"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"even that somebody had to buy the plane ticket."
01:13:56;01:13:59;"Those things can't happen without some amount of money."
01:13:59;01:14:03;"So, you know, there's a lot of people who work on that side of things."
01:14:03;01:14:06;"So I think feel the pressure to get clicks up."
01:14:06;01:14:08;"We're all kind of fighting the same thing."
01:14:08;01:14:09;"I don't know who it is."
01:14:09;01:14:10;"What is it?"
01:14:10;01:14:11;"Facebook?"
01:14:11;01:14:12;"It's probably Facebook."
01:14:12;01:14:13;"The bottom line of everything."
01:14:13;01:14:16;"Well, the way they're destroying the way that advertising works or something."
01:14:16;01:14:17;"Yeah."
01:14:17;01:14:18;"I don't know."
01:14:18;01:14:20;"Maybe it's not just, it's probably not just Facebook, but again, it's something bigger"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"than, than musicians and journalists."
01:14:22;01:14:23;"Right."
01:14:23;01:14:26;"I truly believe that we're all in the same position."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"I waited outside."
01:14:29;01:14:35;"I took it remote."
01:14:35;01:14:42;"I wanted a bed."
01:14:42;01:14:46;"Tell the story or it goes."
01:14:53;01:14:58;"So you talk your money up while it's living in a coal mine."
01:14:58;01:15:02;"So you call your mom."
01:15:02;01:15:04;"Hey, mom."
01:15:04;01:15:05;"Hey, mom."
01:15:05;01:15:09;"So you know you're moving up."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"Well, you wanted it to hold."
01:15:11;01:15:14;"You're back and forth with."
01:15:14;01:15:21;"I waited outside."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"I was talking on."
01:15:24;01:15:27;"I don't need it."
01:15:27;01:15:30;"And the past."
01:15:30;01:15:33;"I wanted all that."
01:15:33;01:15:37;"I wanted all."
01:15:37;01:15:40;"I had a."
01:15:40;01:15:43;"I took it."
01:15:43;01:15:44;"It was."
01:15:44;01:15:48;"You talk your money up."
01:15:49;01:15:52;"While it's living in a coal mine."
01:15:52;01:15:55;"So you call your mom."
01:15:55;01:15:57;"Hey, mom."
01:15:57;01:15:58;"Hey, mom."
01:15:58;01:16:02;"So you know you're moving up."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"Well, you wanted it to hold."
01:16:04;01:16:08;"You're back and forth with."
01:16:08;01:16:14;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats 1."
01:16:14;01:16:17;"Maybe that's just something about third albums being a low point."
01:16:17;01:16:21;"But you're saying on this album, once you do a few too many interviews,"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"you feel that familiar, uncomfortable feeling."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"But generally, you're chilling."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"You're enjoying being on the road."
01:16:27;01:16:29;"Although you just kind of got started."
01:16:29;01:16:31;"So I guess check in with you in six months."
01:16:31;01:16:34;"Well, but we're again, we put in these rules."
01:16:34;01:16:36;"It's like it's not really a rule."
01:16:36;01:16:39;"But like as soon as I started feeling bad, I just had to cancel the interviews."
01:16:39;01:16:40;"You're like, can I please do it next month?"
01:16:40;01:16:41;"Yeah, like I need."
01:16:41;01:16:44;"It's weird, but one interview a day is all I can do."
01:16:44;01:16:46;"Right."
01:16:46;01:16:48;"And then you just have to be, you got to love yourself."
01:16:48;01:16:51;"You got to be like, OK, with asking for that space."
01:16:51;01:16:52;"And then we do."
01:16:52;01:16:56;"We never are gone for more than three weeks and we only do 12 shows in a row."
01:16:56;01:16:58;"Whatever comes first in a row."
01:16:58;01:16:59;"Well, it's right."
01:16:59;01:17:02;"And no more than three shows in a row and no more than 12 shows on the run."
01:17:02;01:17:03;"Yeah."
01:17:03;01:17:06;"And the little things like that just make it like we just got done."
01:17:06;01:17:08;"We play our show at the forum the other night."
01:17:08;01:17:10;"I'm like, I could totally play tomorrow."
01:17:10;01:17:11;"Right."
01:17:11;01:17:13;"And I've had that feeling about zero times."
01:17:13;01:17:14;"Yeah."
01:17:14;01:17:15;"In the 10 years of touring, you know."
01:17:15;01:17:25;"So I'm actually like looking forward to our show in two weeks, which is usually you just try to like run away and hide from the reality that you have to go back out there and
do that."
01:17:25;01:17:26;"We're not in that position right now."
01:17:26;01:17:28;"And I'm really happy that we've changed things."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"Well, that's great."
01:17:29;01:17:34;"And I think it's also, again, maybe that's why it happens to people in similar phases of their career."
01:17:34;01:17:41;"If you don't get to that place by the time you're in your mid to late 30s and on your fourth album, then you got to quit."
01:17:41;01:17:43;"Then you're insane."
01:17:43;01:17:44;"Right."
01:17:44;01:17:51;"So if you have these dark moments where you're like, I don't like how this feels, this makes me feel worse than I've ever felt in my life, something's not adding up."
01:17:51;01:17:59;"Even if other people don't understand and even if you can't put your finger on why you taste something bad and you're like, I can't keep going down that path."
01:17:59;01:18:06;"So either you change things and it becomes something that can be part of the fabric of your life for years to come or you got to stop."
01:18:06;01:18:10;"So it's like you got to find the kind vibe version."
01:18:10;01:18:12;"Are you having more fun than ever?"
01:18:12;01:18:13;"Yeah."
01:18:13;01:18:14;"I mean, calmer."
01:18:14;01:18:19;"I mean, fun doesn't necessarily mean like having 20 beers and yeah, anymore."
01:18:19;01:18:20;"That's all fun too."
01:18:20;01:18:25;"But now there's just like literal fun and just like, oh my God, I'm excited to play music tonight."
01:18:25;01:18:26;"Yeah."
01:18:26;01:18:29;"And you got really fun and you got like an extra special show now, right?"
01:18:29;01:18:30;"Yeah."
01:18:30;01:18:31;"Like just what's the story?"
01:18:31;01:18:34;"The German guy invented some new technology."
01:18:34;01:18:35;"Yeah."
01:18:35;01:18:42;"Well, our like creative director, our lighting designer, Michael Brown, who we've collaborated on a lot of stuff, saw this art show in Berlin."
01:18:42;01:18:43;"And he just like straight up went up to him."
01:18:43;01:18:50;"I was like, would you want to take your ideas and like build a big touring show?"
01:18:50;01:18:55;"And for me, I've tried to be a good leader and stuff like that."
01:18:55;01:18:59;"And I also found that it's important to like give the power to the creative people around you."
01:18:59;01:19:02;"And so I was like, Michael, you're amazing."
01:19:02;01:19:03;"We get along really well."
01:19:03;01:19:08;"I care a lot about what you're going to do, but I don't need to micromanage it or just do something cool."
01:19:08;01:19:15;"And so the first time I saw it was like months and months after it was built in Milwaukee, we went to go rehearse it in this empty arena."
01:19:15;01:19:17;"Because this show has to be in arenas."
01:19:17;01:19:18;"Yes."
01:19:18;01:19:21;"Because this is the first time you ever did a whole, a true arena tour."
01:19:21;01:19:22;"Yes."
01:19:22;01:19:24;"And you know, we added the new band member."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"We added Jen Wozner from Wye Oak in the band."
01:19:26;01:19:28;"So how many people you got on stage?"
01:19:28;01:19:29;"Six now."
01:19:29;01:19:30;"We've had more."
01:19:30;01:19:35;"Last year we were with like five awesome trombone players from Richmond, Virginia."
01:19:35;01:19:40;"It's good to change it up and Jen's been an amazing addition to the band."
01:19:40;01:19:42;"It just feels good, man."
01:19:42;01:19:43;"Yeah."
01:19:43;01:19:44;"It feels calm."
01:19:44;01:19:51;"It's not like we don't get off stage like mega high fiving and like, yeah, there are high fives and hugs, but it's like, hey, that was good."
01:19:51;01:19:52;"Yeah."
01:19:52;01:19:54;"You're right in the middle, right where you're supposed to be."
01:19:54;01:19:55;"Right."
01:19:55;01:20:00;"Enough talking about Boney Ver, Vampire Weekend, Twiddle, The Big Three."
01:20:00;01:20:03;"We're going to talk about some other artists now."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"Let's get into the top five."
01:20:05;01:20:12;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:20:12;01:20:15;"Well, the way we always end the show is by doing the top five."
01:20:15;01:20:17;"And it's always a comparative thing."
01:20:17;01:20:24;"Sometimes we'll compare the top five songs on Billboard right now to the top five songs 30 years ago."
01:20:24;01:20:28;"And we thought because you're here, we could compare our home states."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"Well, for me, I got to choose home states between New York and New Jersey."
01:20:30;01:20:31;"I'm going New Jersey."
01:20:31;01:20:33;"New Jersey seems a little more colorful."
01:20:33;01:20:34;"We're going to compare Wisconsin, New Jersey."
01:20:34;01:20:35;"You down for that?"
01:20:35;01:20:36;"Yeah."
01:20:36;01:20:41;"So our team compiled this top five in a somewhat complicated way, but a fair way."
01:20:41;01:20:45;"We kind of based it on the highest charting singles on Billboard."
01:20:45;01:20:48;"Both great states, New Jersey and Wisconsin."
01:20:48;01:20:50;"But, you know, New Jersey, very dense state."
01:20:50;01:20:51;"Yeah."
01:20:51;01:20:58;"So in New Jersey, we have so many number one hits that we had to do it based on how long they sat on the top of the charts."
01:20:58;01:20:59;"Yeah."
01:20:59;01:21:04;"Just in case we got any stats geeks out there trying to figure out how we came up with this."
01:21:04;01:21:05;"OK, so let's get into this."
01:21:05;01:21:10;"The fifth biggest song ever to come out of Wisconsin is ""Ku Ku Kal - My Projects."""
01:21:10;01:21:12;"This was released in 2001."
01:21:20;01:21:23;"This is a rapper from Milwaukee who signed to Tommy Boy."
01:21:23;01:21:24;"I don't know the name."
01:21:24;01:21:25;"What year?"
01:21:25;01:21:26;"2001."
01:21:26;01:21:29;"What's your relationship to Milwaukee?"
01:21:29;01:21:30;"It's far away."
01:21:30;01:21:33;"Right, because Minneapolis is your city."
01:21:33;01:21:34;"Yeah, I like Milwaukee a lot."
01:21:34;01:21:35;"I got bandmates."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"I play in another band down there."
01:21:37;01:21:40;"But you have no reason to go there when you're home."
01:21:40;01:21:41;"We end up going a lot."
01:21:41;01:21:42;"I love the Bucks."
01:21:42;01:21:43;"Oh, right."
01:21:43;01:21:45;"I'm going to drive the car down there."
01:21:45;01:21:46;"How long does that drive?"
01:21:46;01:21:47;"Four and a half."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"Can you take the Tesla the whole way?"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"Is there somewhere to charge it up?"
01:21:50;01:21:51;"You got to stop at Culver's."
01:21:51;01:21:52;"Is there a supercharger?"
01:21:52;01:21:53;"Yeah."
01:21:53;01:21:56;"So you stop for 45 and --"
01:21:56;01:21:58;"Get a malt and a burger, yeah."
01:22:08;01:22:12;"This is considered the first major rap single to come out of Milwaukee."
01:22:12;01:22:14;"Huh, fascinating."
01:22:14;01:22:15;"Following the collapse of Tommy Boy Records,"
01:22:15;01:22:19;"Kal battled drug and alcohol addiction and served four months in jail on a cocaine charge"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"before fading out of the music scene."
01:22:21;01:22:23;"He returned with a new single last year"
01:22:23;01:22:26;"in a documentary called ""The Rise and Fall of Koo Koo Cow."""
01:22:26;01:22:28;"New documentary to check out."
01:22:28;01:22:29;"Wow."
01:22:29;01:22:30;"Yeah, I never heard that song before."
01:22:30;01:22:32;"It reached number 81 on the Billboard Hot 100,"
01:22:32;01:22:35;"but number one on Billboard's Hot Rap Singles."
01:22:35;01:22:36;"Wow."
01:22:36;01:22:40;"That's got to be the only Wisconsinite ever to top the top 100 singles,"
01:22:40;01:22:43;"unless it's one of the songs he did with Kanye."
01:22:43;01:22:47;"Yeah, well, you can't call that a Wisconsin track, can you?"
01:22:47;01:22:50;"Well, depends how broad you want to be."
01:22:50;01:22:55;"The number five biggest song to come out of New Jersey, Paul Simon."
01:22:55;01:22:58;"He actually has the opposite trajectory to me."
01:22:58;01:23:02;"He was born in Newark, New Jersey, and then grew up in Queens."
01:23:02;01:23:03;"Okay."
01:23:03;01:23:06;"I was born in Manhattan and grew up in New Jersey."
01:23:06;01:23:08;"Very different."
01:23:08;01:23:10;"Incredibly different backgrounds."
01:23:10;01:23:12;"But is this his biggest single?"
01:23:12;01:23:14;"His highest charting single?"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"Mrs. Robinson?"
01:23:16;01:23:17;"No, solo."

01:23:37;01:23:40;"Yeah, the song is, like, very dark and mysterious until the chorus."
01:23:40;01:23:43;"It's like a perfect song until you get to the chorus."
01:23:43;01:23:47;"It is a little-- it's one of the more mailed-in choruses of Paul's, I feel like."
01:23:47;01:23:50;"In fact, there's a lot of jokes you can do about the chorus."

01:25:21;01:25:22;"Every 50."
01:25:22;01:25:26;"He's not talking about, like, the weird emotional terrain."
01:25:26;01:25:29;"He's literally like, ""Well, Gus could get on the bus."""
01:25:29;01:25:32;"It's like weirdly just kind of practical."
01:25:32;01:25:35;"And also the only option you have to leave your lover"
01:25:35;01:25:38;"is it has to rhyme with your first name."
01:25:38;01:25:39;"Right, yeah."
01:25:39;01:25:41;"Don't be Coy-Roy."
01:25:43;01:25:45;"What's the one for Justin?"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"Bustin' out Justin."

01:25:52;01:25:54;"Well, yeah, it's weird, Mick."
01:25:54;01:25:55;"These are also--"
01:25:55;01:25:58;"They're not very specific to leaving a lover."
01:25:58;01:25:59;"Yeah."
01:25:59;01:26:02;"You could take the bus to leave Target."
01:26:02;01:26:03;"No need to be Coy-Roy."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"Like, all right, just get yourself free."
01:26:05;01:26:07;"Yeah, it's good advice, though."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"Maybe the whole point is that he's saying--"
01:26:09;01:26:10;"I guess it all tracks."
01:26:10;01:26:12;"He's saying, ""Listen, I could sit here"

01:26:14;01:26:16;"Yeah, there's 50 ways to leave your lover."
01:26:16;01:26:18;"The important thing is get yourself free."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"Okay, so it adds up."
01:26:19;01:26:20;"Yeah, it does."
01:26:20;01:26:21;"All right."
01:26:21;01:26:22;"[laughs]"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"You spending any significant time in Jersey?"
01:26:24;01:26:25;"No."
01:26:25;01:26:26;"Maybe you'd want to move there."
01:26:26;01:26:27;"Maybe."
01:26:27;01:26:28;"[laughter]"
01:26:28;01:26:29;"Yeah."
01:26:29;01:26:32;"It probably has some things in common with Wisconsin."
01:26:32;01:26:34;"You know, we got farmland out there, too."
01:26:34;01:26:35;"It's the Garden State."
01:26:35;01:26:36;"Yeah."
01:26:36;01:26:37;"You ever watch The Sopranos?"
01:26:37;01:26:38;"Yeah."
01:26:38;01:26:39;"You go deep on that?"
01:26:39;01:26:40;"Yeah, three times."
01:26:40;01:26:42;"Actually, I've watched it three times, too."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"We were talking earlier about tour and depression"
01:26:44;01:26:45;"and things like that."
01:26:45;01:26:48;"On one of those tours where I really wasn't very happy,"
01:26:48;01:26:52;"I watched The Sopranos, and I have such emotions about it"
01:26:52;01:26:54;"because I'm so familiar with the terrain,"
01:26:54;01:26:56;"like, literally just the towns it was shot in,"
01:26:56;01:26:57;"just kind of where I grew up."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"There is something about it, I guess,"
01:26:59;01:27:02;"because it's good art or it's powerful art."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"When I watch the whole thing through,"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"and that's why even though it's been the 20-year thing"
01:27:06;01:27:07;"and a lot of people are talking about it again,"
01:27:07;01:27:10;"I've been hesitant to rewatch it, I get depressed"
01:27:10;01:27:13;"because it's fundamentally a show about depression."
01:27:13;01:27:15;"It's so powerful, but, you know,"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"it's not like watching, like, Breaking Bad,"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"and just like, ""Oh, s***, what's going to happen next?"""
01:27:19;01:27:20;"No, it's real."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"It's heavy."
01:27:21;01:27:22;"So I remember, like, you know,"
01:27:22;01:27:23;"some nights being on, like, tour in Europe"
01:27:23;01:27:26;"and, like, taking down, like, three and a half Sopranos"
01:27:26;01:27:28;"and just, like, staring at the ceiling,"
01:27:28;01:27:30;"just being like, ""What's the point of life?"""
01:27:30;01:27:32;"Yeah, tough spot to be in."
01:27:32;01:27:33;"It's heavy."
01:27:33;01:27:34;"Does The Sopranos make you depressed?"
01:27:34;01:27:37;"It makes me order a lot of, like,"
01:27:37;01:27:41;"parmesan sandwiches from Broder's in Minneapolis."
01:27:41;01:27:42;"Yeah."
01:27:42;01:27:45;"Do you have access to quality Italian food in Eau Claire?"
01:27:45;01:27:46;"No."
01:27:46;01:27:47;"Not at all?"
01:27:47;01:27:48;"No."
01:27:48;01:27:49;"I was living in Minneapolis for a short period of time."
01:27:49;01:27:51;"Is there, like, one Italian guy with a pizzeria"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"listening in Eau Claire just like, ""S***""?"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"I don't think there's any Italian folks in town."
01:27:55;01:27:56;"Really?"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"Yeah, I guess there's not a lot of Italian people in rural."
01:27:58;01:27:59;"No."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"'Cause is everybody, like, Scandinavian?"
01:28:01;01:28:02;"Norwegian, German."
01:28:02;01:28:04;"It's Scandinavian vibes."
01:28:04;01:28:05;"What's your background?"
01:28:05;01:28:07;"Norwegian."
01:28:07;01:28:09;"My mom's parents were fully--"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"Does that still show up culturally,"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"eating, like, little fish and things of that nature?"
01:28:13;01:28:14;"Yeah, like, we eat--"
01:28:14;01:28:15;"What's the--"
01:28:15;01:28:16;"Matches?"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"No, what is it?"
01:28:17;01:28:18;"It's at Thanksgiving."
01:28:18;01:28:20;"We call it lutefisk."
01:28:20;01:28:21;"Oh, okay."
01:28:21;01:28:22;"I don't eat that s***, though."
01:28:22;01:28:24;"It's just butter with, like, boiled fish."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"It's awful."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"Oh."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"Do you feel Norwegian?"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"I think I feel Wisconsin Norwegian."
01:28:29;01:28:31;"When I went to Norway, I didn't feel like,"
01:28:31;01:28:32;"""This is where I'm from."""
01:28:32;01:28:33;"Right."
01:28:33;01:28:36;"I feel very much from, you know, Wisconsin and Norway."
01:28:36;01:28:38;"You know, like, ""Oh, yeah, asshole."""
01:28:38;01:28:39;"Right."
01:28:39;01:28:40;"That's us."
01:28:40;01:28:41;"We gotta get some good Italian food in Eau Claire."
01:28:41;01:28:42;"This is a million-dollar idea."
01:28:42;01:28:44;"There's-- Mona Lisa's is all right."
01:28:44;01:28:46;"It's pretty good pizza and stuff, but it's not, like, Italian."
01:28:46;01:28:48;"Is there, like, a family pizzeria vibe?"
01:28:48;01:28:50;"Mm, yeah, there's a couple decent pizza places."
01:28:50;01:28:51;"Oh, so there is pizza."
01:28:51;01:28:53;"But I wouldn't call it, like, Italian."
01:28:53;01:28:55;"You know, like, pizza is no longer--"
01:28:55;01:28:58;"Me and you should go in and open, like, a New Jersey Italian restaurant."
01:28:58;01:29:00;"Big ziti."
01:29:00;01:29:02;"[laughter]"
01:29:02;01:29:04;"Is there an appetite for it out there?"
01:29:04;01:29:06;"Man, we got a lot of chain restaurants."
01:29:06;01:29:07;"Yeah."
01:29:07;01:29:09;"We got a couple of really great places to eat."
01:29:09;01:29:11;"Matter of fact, it's, like, mostly, you know,"
01:29:11;01:29:13;"Norwegian, Scandinavian folks,"
01:29:13;01:29:16;"and then we have a really large Hmong population,"
01:29:16;01:29:17;"Vietnamese population."
01:29:17;01:29:18;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:29:18;01:29:20;"The highest percentages in the states,"
01:29:20;01:29:23;"other than L.A. here and Minneapolis and Eau Claire are really high."
01:29:23;01:29:26;"So we have insanely good Vietnamese food."
01:29:26;01:29:28;"That's my favorite spot in town."
01:29:28;01:29:29;"Egg Roll Plus."
01:29:29;01:29:30;"Egg Roll Plus?"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"Whew, I like the name."
01:29:32;01:29:33;"Yeah."
01:29:33;01:29:36;"Just before I drop the idea of us opening an Italian restaurant in Eau Claire,"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"there's a place that I first heard about"
01:29:38;01:29:42;"because I have some close friends who went to college in Syracuse, New York,"
01:29:42;01:29:43;"upstate."
01:29:43;01:29:45;"I think there's a few of these."
01:29:45;01:29:49;"There's one in Syracuse, but there's a local Italian place called Pastabilities."
01:29:49;01:29:51;"And I always thought it was such a good name."
01:29:51;01:29:52;"It really is."
01:29:52;01:29:54;"And I don't know if they're in the franchise business."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"So it sounds like you've got plenty of pizza,"
01:29:56;01:29:59;"but if you want to go have a nice sit-down pasta dinner,"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"you don't know where to go in Eau Claire."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"Plenty of Pastabilities."
01:30:03;01:30:05;"So me and you open up a Pastabilities."
01:30:05;01:30:06;"I like the idea of a chain."
01:30:06;01:30:07;"Chains work."
01:30:07;01:30:10;"There's that great Onion article about how, like,"
01:30:10;01:30:13;"Americans love the things they recognize."
01:30:13;01:30:16;"Whatever, I wish I could read the whole thing and recite it."
01:30:16;01:30:19;"But, yeah, if they've seen it before, then they can understand it."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"They've probably heard about it, but Syracuse is a schlep,"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"so that we open a Pastabilities."
01:30:23;01:30:24;"Yeah, that would work."
01:30:24;01:30:26;"And also the name is so inviting."
01:30:26;01:30:28;"There's so many Pastabilities."
01:30:28;01:30:30;"That's the type of place you want to go back to."
01:30:30;01:30:31;"Yeah."
01:30:31;01:30:32;"Think of the Pastabilities."
01:30:32;01:30:34;"[laughs]"
01:30:34;01:30:36;"Okay, I consider this a--"
01:30:36;01:30:37;"A win."
01:30:37;01:30:38;"A kind of handshake agreement."
01:30:38;01:30:39;"Yeah."
01:30:39;01:30:40;"Now, I'm surprised by this."
01:30:40;01:30:41;"We're going back to Wisconsin."
01:30:41;01:30:44;"Now, the fourth biggest song ever to come out of Wisconsin."
01:30:44;01:30:46;"The band is Garbage."
01:30:46;01:30:47;"Right."
01:30:47;01:30:49;"So maybe--so explain, what is the Garbage connection?"
01:30:49;01:30:51;"Because the singer's Scottish."
01:30:51;01:30:54;"They did all the recording in a great studio in Madison"
01:30:54;01:30:57;"called Smart Studios that a few of my friends have grown up--"
01:30:57;01:30:59;"bandmate of mine lives in Madison."
01:30:59;01:31:01;"And, matter of fact, one of the guys that engineers"
01:31:01;01:31:04;"that tiny telephone out in Oakland, what a great studio out there,"
01:31:04;01:31:07;"he was an intern at--Bull Sorensen's his name."
01:31:07;01:31:09;"He was an intern at Smart for a long time."
01:31:09;01:31:10;"But it's a great studio."
01:31:10;01:31:11;"I don't even think it's there anymore."
01:31:11;01:31:12;"I would hate to be wrong."
01:31:12;01:31:15;"Whoa, they recorded their first four albums there at Smart Studios."
01:31:15;01:31:17;"That was Vig's favorite spot."
01:31:17;01:31:18;"Is he from Wisconsin?"
01:31:18;01:31:20;"Now I'm beginning to wonder."
01:31:20;01:31:22;"I never thought that, but I always--I did know they were"
01:31:22;01:31:25;"like a Madison-centrated band."
01:31:25;01:31:27;"It says the band formed in Madison."
01:31:27;01:31:28;"Huh, crazy."
01:31:28;01:31:31;"Maybe Shirley Manson was going to grad school"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"at the University of Wisconsin."
01:31:33;01:31:34;"That's my guess."
01:31:34;01:31:35;"Yeah, that's a great guess."
01:31:35;01:31:37;"So I guess their biggest song is ""Stupid Girl."""
01:31:37;01:31:40;"[drums]"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"The drums are a Clash sample."
01:31:42;01:31:43;"Are they?"
01:31:43;01:31:44;"Yeah, ""Train and Van,"" you know the song?"
01:31:44;01:31:45;"Oh, wow."
01:31:45;01:31:48;"[singing]"
01:31:48;01:31:51;"Oh, yeah, Butch Vig is from a town called Verroqua?"
01:31:51;01:31:52;"Verroqua."
01:31:52;01:31:54;"Verroqua, Wisconsin."
01:31:54;01:31:55;"Wow."
01:32:09;01:32:11;"Were you listening to Garbage in 1996?"
01:32:11;01:32:12;"No."
01:32:12;01:32:14;"You were listening to Ricky Lee Jones?"
01:32:14;01:32:15;"Yeah."
01:32:15;01:32:16;"[laughs]"
01:32:16;01:32:18;"Do you like Ricky Lee?"
01:32:18;01:32:19;"Do you like some of our [bleep]?"
01:32:19;01:32:22;"I've always wanted to go deep, because I mean, I'm a fake fan."
01:32:22;01:32:24;"I like Chuck E.'s ""In Love,"" right?"
01:32:24;01:32:25;"Yeah, first four albums."
01:32:25;01:32:26;"I should check it out."
01:32:26;01:32:29;"Yeah, great arranger, great vocalist."
01:32:53;01:32:56;"This is like so late '90s to me."
01:32:56;01:32:59;"We have that kind of international sound."
01:32:59;01:33:02;"It's funny that it was recorded in Madison, because this is like--"
01:33:02;01:33:03;"seems very, like, London-y."
01:33:03;01:33:07;"Yeah, it sounds like what I would imagine Portishead sounds like or something."
01:33:07;01:33:08;"Not familiar with Portishead?"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"[laughs]"
01:33:10;01:33:12;"Wow, I really just walked into that one."
01:33:12;01:33:14;"Although I have heard a couple of Portishead sounds, but I'm always like,"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"""This is Portishead. Cool."""
01:33:16;01:33:17;"But I haven't--"
01:33:17;01:33:18;"Right."
01:33:18;01:33:19;"You know, it's just like one of those things, you just don't hear everything."
01:33:19;01:33:20;"Yeah."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"Look, it's not a million miles away."
01:33:21;01:33:22;"No, it's true."
01:33:22;01:33:23;"I can find it."
01:33:23;01:33:25;"Loot-based, English-y, but that's Wisconsin music."
01:33:25;01:33:27;"Yeah."
01:33:27;01:33:28;"It's good Wisconsin music."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"[laughs]"
01:33:30;01:33:34;"The number four song out of New Jersey, Frank Sinatra."
01:33:34;01:33:35;"Oh."
01:33:35;01:33:37;"""Strangers in the Night,"" I guess this is his highest-charting single."
01:33:40;01:33:44;"I'm more surprised that people's number one songs--"
01:33:44;01:33:47;"Right, because some songs loom larger decades--"
01:33:47;01:33:50;"Certainly, Sinatra's best song is ""My Way,"" right?"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"One of them."
01:33:52;01:33:54;"That ""New York, New York"" is so iconic."
01:33:54;01:33:55;"Oh, that's tough, too."
01:33:58;01:34:00;"This song makes me think of ""Fletch."""
01:34:00;01:34:01;"You remember that movie?"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"""O Chevy Chase""? I've never actually seen it."
01:34:03;01:34:04;"It's my favorite."
01:34:04;01:34:07;"""Strangers in my Pants,"" that's what he says."
01:34:07;01:34:08;"[laughs]"
01:34:08;01:34:10;"He's just opening the door to his apartment saying that to himself."
01:34:10;01:34:11;"It's a great one."
01:34:11;01:34:12;"Oh, yeah?"
01:34:12;01:34:13;"[laughs]"
01:34:13;01:34:16;"I guess Sinatra only had two number one Billboard hits,"
01:34:16;01:34:20;"this and then his duet with his daughter, ""Something Stupid."""
01:34:20;01:34:21;"I don't know that one."
01:34:30;01:34:34;"It's also funny, too, with Sinatra, I'm always shocked when stuff actually came out."
01:34:34;01:34:37;"So this song came out in 1966."
01:34:37;01:34:41;"You think of classic Sinatra as being late '40s through the '50s,"
01:34:41;01:34:42;"but then he had this incredibly long career."
01:34:42;01:34:47;"I was very shocked when I found out ""New York, New York"" came out in the late '70s."
01:34:47;01:34:48;"No [bleep]"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"It was from a movie or something."
01:34:50;01:34:55;"So you feel like 1966, this is like ""Revolver"" era,"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"but this is topping the charts."
01:34:57;01:34:59;"I just saw a bunch of boxes of Frito-Lago, bud."
01:34:59;01:35:01;"Do you think that's your weekly shipment of Flamin' Hot?"
01:35:01;01:35:02;"No, I put it in a text."
01:35:02;01:35:04;"They probably sent it straight for you."
01:35:04;01:35:06;"[laughs]"
01:35:06;01:35:08;"I wonder if this whole long conversation we've had today,"
01:35:08;01:35:10;"that's going to be the big takeaway."
01:35:10;01:35:12;"Yeah, I mean, it's mine."
01:35:12;01:35:15;"Well, also, you kind of admitted to littering."
01:35:15;01:35:16;"Yep, I did."
01:35:16;01:35:17;"[laughs]"
01:35:17;01:35:18;"I wanted to be honest about it."
01:35:18;01:35:20;"I was like, I just put it down."
01:35:20;01:35:21;"I knew somebody was going to get it."
01:35:21;01:35:23;"Right, you put something in garbage."
01:35:23;01:35:24;"I didn't empty it and toss it."
01:35:24;01:35:27;"I made sure it was standing up,"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"so if anybody wanted to reach in and grab any, they could."
01:35:29;01:35:30;"Yeah."
01:35:30;01:35:33;"Dig in a little bit, maybe don't take one up top."
01:35:33;01:35:36;"Yeah, or maybe leave the rest for anyone else."
01:35:36;01:35:37;"[laughs]"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"It's from Hoboken, New Jersey."
01:35:39;01:35:40;"Huh."
01:35:40;01:35:41;"You ever been to Hoboken?"
01:35:41;01:35:44;"No, but we are playing with Yolo Tango at Barclays next month."
01:35:44;01:35:45;"Right, classic."
01:35:45;01:35:49;"So you have different openers every show or every leg?"
01:35:49;01:35:52;"We did Sharon Van Etten for this leg,"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"and then we're doing Leslie Feist."
01:35:54;01:35:56;"And Indigo Girls somewhere?"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"Yeah, in Missoula, our first show of the tour,"
01:35:58;01:36:03;"which was kind of a mistake because they were really good,"
01:36:03;01:36:06;"and my mom was there, and I wept."
01:36:06;01:36:08;"While you were watching them?"
01:36:08;01:36:11;"Yeah, and then that's really hard on your voice,"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"all the weepy snot stuff."
01:36:13;01:36:14;"Oh."
01:36:14;01:36:17;"It was really hard to sing that night because I had wept too much."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"Did you explain that to the crowd?"
01:36:19;01:36:22;"No, no, I didn't."
01:36:22;01:36:23;"I should have."
01:36:23;01:36:25;"What's your top Indigo Girls?"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"Swan Pavilion is my favorite album,"
01:36:27;01:36:30;"and Fugitive, first track on that album,"
01:36:30;01:36:32;"number one favorite song of all time."
01:36:32;01:36:33;"I got to go deep."
01:36:33;01:36:35;"I only know the hits, but I love them."
01:36:35;01:36:36;"Yeah, they're great."
01:36:36;01:36:37;"Back to Wisconsin."
01:36:37;01:36:39;"The Bodines?"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"What do the Bodines mean to you?"
01:36:41;01:36:44;"I actually saw them in eighth grade with my friend Sue"
01:36:44;01:36:47;"because her brother who was in college brought us"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"because he loved the Bodines."
01:36:49;01:36:51;"They sort of sound like the Rembrandts, I feel like."
01:36:51;01:36:54;"Their song, like the Rembrandts, was used for the theme song"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"of a big show in the '90s, Party of Five."
01:36:56;01:36:57;"That's right."
01:36:57;01:36:58;"I'm tripping here."
01:36:58;01:36:59;"Their song's Closer to Free."
01:36:59;01:37:02;"Don't Indigo Girls have a song called Closer to Free or something?"
01:37:02;01:37:03;"Closer to Fine."
01:37:03;01:37:04;"Oh."
01:37:04;01:37:05;"♪ Closer to-- ♪"
01:37:05;01:37:06;"Wait, how does that song go?"
01:37:06;01:37:09;"♪ Closer I am to find you ♪"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"How does this song go?"
01:37:11;01:37:12;"I could play it."
01:37:12;01:37:13;"[laughter]"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"Right, Closer to Fine, that's one of their biggest songs, right?"
01:37:15;01:37:16;"Yeah."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"This song's Closer to Free."
01:37:17;01:37:19;"This is the theme song from Party to Five."
01:37:19;01:37:21;"Rembrandts did the song from Friends."
01:37:21;01:37:22;"You a big Friends guy?"
01:37:22;01:37:23;"No."
01:37:23;01:37:24;"You like Seinfeld?"
01:37:24;01:37:28;"I watch both of those shows, and I would consider myself a fan."
01:37:28;01:37:29;"Of both shows?"
01:37:29;01:37:30;"I don't binge on them."
01:37:30;01:37:32;"Do you binge watch stuff?"
01:37:32;01:37:34;"Yeah, like Ken Burns' Country."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"I've watched Ken Burns' Vietnam."
01:37:36;01:37:37;"Oh, God."
01:37:37;01:37:38;"Yeah."
01:37:38;01:37:39;"I've been trying to get Jake into it."
01:37:39;01:37:40;"Civil War."
01:37:40;01:37:41;"Yeah."
01:37:41;01:37:44;"I've just finished The West, which is actually--he just presents, he doesn't direct--and National"
01:37:44;01:37:49;"Parks, which is very easy to fall asleep to but insanely entertaining."
01:37:49;01:37:53;"I find with a lot of his, it's like the first two episodes, it's like you got to hold your"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"eyes open like Clockwork Orange style."
01:37:55;01:37:58;"Then you hit this point where you're just like, ""I'm so glad I'm doing this."""
01:37:58;01:37:59;"I know."
01:37:59;01:38:00;"That's all I did yesterday."
01:38:00;01:38:03;"I just kept looking to my friends like, ""I'm so glad we're watching this right now."""
01:38:03;01:38:04;"What about Succession?"
01:38:04;01:38:05;"What's that?"
01:38:05;01:38:09;"This is kind of about a Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch-esque rich family in New York."
01:38:09;01:38:11;"It's on its second season on HBO."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"I don't know it."
01:38:12;01:38:14;"There's a lot of good stuff on HBO, isn't there?"
01:38:14;01:38:15;"You got a good track record."
01:38:15;01:38:16;"Yeah."
01:38:16;01:38:17;"But I like this."
01:38:17;01:38:19;"You're living in that Ken Burns space right now."
01:38:19;01:38:20;"Yeah."
01:38:20;01:38:21;"That's also good for tour."
01:38:21;01:38:24;"National Parks, America's greatest idea."
01:38:24;01:38:25;"They should get me on there."
01:38:25;01:38:27;"I sound like, ""America's greatest idea."""
01:38:27;01:38:32;"Maybe you and Ken Burns should team up for the Wisconsin music story from Cuckoo Cow"
01:38:32;01:38:33;"to the Bodines."
01:38:33;01:38:36;"I wonder if I know this Bodines song."
01:38:36;01:38:39;"Just like sepia-toned pictures of the Bodines."
01:38:39;01:38:42;"For no reason, it's just like sepia-toned."
01:38:42;01:38:43;"The slow push."
01:38:43;01:38:45;"Okay, so this is closer to free."
01:38:45;01:38:47;"Is it going to be closer to fine ripoff?"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"Are we about to retroactively ruin somebody's life?"
01:38:49;01:38:50;"Yeah."
01:38:50;01:38:51;"I don't want that blood on my hands, but let's find out."
01:38:59;01:39:01;"1993."
01:39:06;01:39:08;"So these guys are from Waukesha."
01:39:08;01:39:10;"It's all east side of the state so far."
01:39:10;01:39:11;"Wait, so sorry."
01:39:11;01:39:13;"Eau Claire is what part of Wisconsin?"
01:39:13;01:39:14;"Northwest."
01:39:14;01:39:16;"Everything's in the weird part of the state so far."
01:39:16;01:39:20;"Are people from down south in Wisconsin kind of soft compared to up where you're from?"
01:39:20;01:39:22;"I mean, of course, I'd think so."
01:39:22;01:39:24;"Well, because you're from like, you're from the great north."
01:39:24;01:39:25;"Yeah."
01:39:25;01:39:28;"You're like Scottish and Waukesha's like London."
01:39:28;01:39:30;"[laughs]"
01:39:30;01:39:31;"You're from the Orkney Isles."
01:39:31;01:39:33;"Yes, let's go with that."
01:39:33;01:39:34;"You're from Aberdeen."
01:39:34;01:39:35;"Yeah."
01:39:49;01:39:53;"It's hard imagining Ross and Joey like playing in the fountain right now."
01:39:53;01:39:55;"You know what I mean?"
01:39:55;01:39:57;"[laughs]"
01:39:57;01:39:59;"We should get Seinfeld 2000 to do this."
01:39:59;01:40:04;"Just like such a deep, pointless joke, but take the Bodine song and put it over the Friends intro"
01:40:04;01:40:07;"and then take the Friends song and put it over the Party 5 intro."
01:40:07;01:40:08;"No comment."
01:40:09;01:40:11;"Play it on the Jumbo Tron before your next show."
01:40:11;01:40:14;"If we had Doug Pound and Vic Berger in here, they'd be on the case."
01:40:14;01:40:15;"That's right."
01:40:15;01:40:16;"I heard you on that [bleep] man."
01:40:16;01:40:17;"I love that podcast so much."
01:40:17;01:40:18;"Oh, Highdecker?"
01:40:18;01:40:19;"Whoo."
01:40:19;01:40:20;"He's a legend."
01:40:20;01:40:21;"Yeah."
01:40:21;01:40:22;"He'd be a good person to get to open up some shows."
01:40:22;01:40:23;"I don't think so."
01:40:23;01:40:26;"[laughs]"
01:40:26;01:40:28;"I'm a little scared of how good he is, actually."
01:40:28;01:40:29;"You don't want to get the weep voice."
01:40:29;01:40:30;"I don't know."
01:40:30;01:40:31;"I would voice him."
01:40:31;01:40:33;"I might just be like, ""Man, this guy's alienating a lot of folks."""
01:40:33;01:40:34;"Perhaps."
01:40:34;01:40:35;"But I think he's so brilliant."
01:40:35;01:40:36;"I just am such a fan."
01:40:36;01:40:37;"Oh, yeah."
01:40:37;01:40:38;"And he's got a movie coming out I just saw."
01:40:38;01:40:39;"It looks scary."
01:40:39;01:40:41;"I'm going to have to get ready to watch it, though."
01:40:41;01:40:42;"Yeah."
01:40:42;01:40:44;"I'm going to be like, ""Holy [bleep] how are they doing this?"
01:40:44;01:40:45;"They're not getting arrested."""
01:40:45;01:40:46;"He's great."
01:40:46;01:40:47;"Bodines."
01:40:47;01:40:48;"Hmm."
01:40:48;01:40:52;"Is Waukesha where-- Does that figure into the making of a murder?"
01:40:52;01:40:53;"You watch that?"
01:40:53;01:40:54;"It's close."
01:40:54;01:40:55;"It's north of Milwaukee."
01:40:55;01:40:57;"Is Waukesha also a county?"
01:40:57;01:40:58;"Manitowoc County."
01:40:58;01:40:59;"Oh, Manitowoc County."
01:40:59;01:41:00;"Right."
01:41:00;01:41:01;"Yeah."
01:41:01;01:41:02;"And that's over in the east side of the state there."
01:41:02;01:41:03;"So do you watch Making of a Murderer?"
01:41:03;01:41:04;"Oh, yeah."
01:41:04;01:41:06;"Can you pull any strings to free that kid?"
01:41:06;01:41:08;"Dude, no."
01:41:08;01:41:09;"[laughs]"
01:41:09;01:41:10;"It's so--"
01:41:10;01:41:12;"All the police and judges in your pocket are more northwest."
01:41:12;01:41:13;"Yeah."
01:41:13;01:41:14;"[laughs]"
01:41:14;01:41:15;"Oh, it's so brutal."
01:41:15;01:41:16;"Oh, geez."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"It is very brutal."
01:41:17;01:41:20;"That's the type of thing that really makes you be like, ""Everybody should donate money"
01:41:20;01:41:24;"to these wrongful conviction places,"" because it makes you want to pull your hair out."
01:41:24;01:41:25;"It does."
01:41:25;01:41:26;"It's maddening."
01:41:26;01:41:27;"It's brutal."
01:41:27;01:41:29;"Anyway, well, this is an interesting song to segue into."
01:41:29;01:41:32;"Back to New Jersey, Gloria Gaynor."
01:41:32;01:41:35;"New Jersey just-- These are just big, fat songs."
01:41:35;01:41:37;"Wisconsin is pleasantly random so far."
01:41:37;01:41:38;"[laughs]"
01:41:39;01:41:41;"Gloria Gaynor, born in Newark."
01:41:41;01:41:45;"Same city as Philip Roth, Paul Simon."
01:41:45;01:41:47;"A lot of people coming out of Newark."
01:41:47;01:41:48;"What a classic song."
01:41:48;01:41:49;"Just a great song."
01:42:06;01:42:07;"You kind of like everything."
01:42:07;01:42:08;"You're just a music guy."
01:42:08;01:42:09;"Yeah."
01:42:09;01:42:12;"Very little that I'm really dislike."
01:42:12;01:42:13;"Yeah."
01:42:13;01:42:15;"My hardest thing lately is just stuff from now."
01:42:15;01:42:16;"We're reaching that age."
01:42:16;01:42:19;"It's not like, ""Oh, I don't understand."""
01:42:19;01:42:21;"It's just I don't know where to begin."
01:42:21;01:42:25;"I don't really need a lot of new music sometimes."
01:42:25;01:42:31;"I'll be caught on some old trip where I'm listening to something from a while back"
01:42:31;01:42:37;"or 10 years ago or 50 years ago or something, and I'll just forget to check out new stuff."
01:42:37;01:42:41;"It's a little tiring, but every once in a while, something comes out that will just"
01:42:41;01:42:46;"rearrange my brain like Tierra Whack's Whack World came out last year."
01:42:46;01:42:47;"Oh, yeah."
01:42:47;01:42:48;"That's cool."
01:42:48;01:42:49;"It rearranged my brain."
01:42:49;01:42:50;"Yeah."
01:42:50;01:42:51;"It's perfect."
01:42:51;01:42:52;"I listen to it constantly."
01:42:52;01:42:57;"It just feels like, ""Well, this music is coming out now, but all other music came out before this."""
01:42:57;01:42:58;"Right."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"It's a better place to start."
01:42:59;01:43:01;"Well, it's also like, I don't know."
01:43:01;01:43:05;"You can almost compare it to meditation or something."
01:43:05;01:43:10;"You could travel the whole world, go to every country in the world, come back home,"
01:43:10;01:43:12;"and you're even more stupid than when you left."
01:43:12;01:43:17;"Or you could stay in one place and go deeper inside yourself or focus on the relationships"
01:43:17;01:43:20;"of the people around you and really understand the one place."
01:43:20;01:43:25;"Well, again, keep coming back to my admiration for people who stay in one place."
01:43:25;01:43:30;"But where you spend a lot of time in one place, you could learn just as much about humanity"
01:43:30;01:43:34;"as if you were-- and especially when you go on tour, you especially feel that idea of"
01:43:34;01:43:36;"people are like, ""Wow, you're traveling the world."
01:43:36;01:43:38;"You must be learning so much."""
01:43:38;01:43:40;"And you're just like, ""Nope, nope."""
01:43:40;01:43:45;"I definitely learn way more when I'm in one place and I can really spend quality time with people."
01:43:45;01:43:50;"I think that's why I love being in Wisconsin because it's a microcosm for just about anything."
01:43:50;01:43:55;"And I like it and I'm confused by the people there, confused by myself and the other people"
01:43:55;01:43:59;"there as much as I am confused and interested in the people from anywhere."
01:43:59;01:44:03;"So it's cool to get the long view of a place."
01:44:03;01:44:05;"I guess it's the same with music."
01:44:05;01:44:10;"You could be in a frenzied state to be up on everything, the feelings about all new music"
01:44:10;01:44:15;"and what is that and what-- I think that's also why you see more and more people getting older,"
01:44:15;01:44:20;"especially people who have some affection for classic rock music, why the dead is so attractive"
01:44:20;01:44:25;"because it is this one thing that you could spend your entire life going deeper and deeper on."
01:44:25;01:44:29;"And sometimes it's nice just to kind of focus on one thing or, you know, like if you're a big music nerd,"
01:44:29;01:44:35;"you go down a rabbit hole of like something, you know, you thought you knew all about '70s music"
01:44:35;01:44:39;"and then you find that one new record and then you're like checking out other stuff that came out on that label,"
01:44:39;01:44:40;"like some funk label."
01:44:40;01:44:46;"There is something about that that is a nice antidote to that frenzied feeling of information overload"
01:44:46;01:44:50;"about trying to stay up, which again, when you're young, you do naturally."
01:44:50;01:44:52;"And like who is the person? I mean like--"
01:44:52;01:44:53;"Right."
01:44:53;01:44:54;"Yeah, totally."
01:44:54;01:44:57;"Yeah, because like back in the day, you're in the locker room, everybody's blasting Limp Bizkit."
01:44:57;01:44:59;"That just was in your world."
01:44:59;01:45:00;"Yeah."
01:45:00;01:45:02;"You had a context for it, you had some sense of what it represents."
01:45:02;01:45:06;"Now you don't remember the songs, but I'm sure after this you'll go compile it."
01:45:06;01:45:07;"I'm sure."
01:45:07;01:45:09;"Sometimes we do playlists."
01:45:09;01:45:12;"Maybe we could do that Justin Verdon's Top 10 Limp Bizkit Songs."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"Yeah, I'll come back to you in a year or so."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"Yeah, you got a couple years to get it together."
01:45:16;01:45:20;"But again, it's like you know what other people like, you know what the kids at school like"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"and whether you like it or not, it's there."
01:45:22;01:45:23;"You're familiar with it."
01:45:23;01:45:26;"I think also there's something fun if you try too hard when you get older,"
01:45:26;01:45:27;"you can also just get it wrong."
01:45:27;01:45:31;"There's something about when you're young, you just understand what music represents."
01:45:31;01:45:32;"That person likes that."
01:45:32;01:45:37;"When you're older, if you're like trying to like read music media to understand what's new and important,"
01:45:37;01:45:39;"it's not always accurate."
01:45:39;01:45:42;"And then I feel you could be in some funny position where you're like, you know,"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"if you had like a fortune or a kid, you're just like,"
01:45:44;01:45:48;"""So you know, I read pretty recently that people are pretty excited about this artist."""
01:45:48;01:45:49;"Be like, ""I've never heard of that."""
01:45:49;01:45:51;"It's, you know, it gets lost in translation."
01:45:51;01:45:52;"Yep."
01:45:52;01:45:53;"Back to Wisconsin."
01:45:53;01:45:55;"This is the number two song."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"Now we're getting into the serious stuff."
01:45:57;01:45:58;"Yeah."
01:45:58;01:45:59;"Al Jarreau."
01:45:59;01:46:00;"I didn't know he was from Wisconsin."
01:46:00;01:46:01;"Neither did I, man."
01:46:01;01:46:02;"This is educational as a [expletive]."
01:46:02;01:46:03;"Let's see."
01:46:03;01:46:04;"He was born in Milwaukee."
01:46:04;01:46:06;"Again, we got that kind of Eastern bias."
01:46:06;01:46:07;"Yep."
01:46:07;01:46:09;"Who else is from Northwest?"
01:46:09;01:46:12;"There's this guy that won American Idol, I think."
01:46:12;01:46:13;"Oh, really?"
01:46:13;01:46:14;"He's from like a town like 40 minutes north of me."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"Yeah."
01:46:15;01:46:16;"Are you guys friends?"
01:46:16;01:46:17;"I haven't met him yet."
01:46:17;01:46:18;"Al Jarreau was born in Milwaukee."
01:46:18;01:46:20;"He served as student council president at Lincoln High School"
01:46:20;01:46:22;"and attended college in Rippon?"
01:46:22;01:46:23;"Rippon."
01:46:23;01:46:24;"Rippon College, yeah."
01:46:24;01:46:25;"Rippon, Wisconsin."
01:46:25;01:46:26;"Wow."
01:46:26;01:46:31;"So Al Jarreau, maybe I don't know Al Jarreau that much."
01:46:31;01:46:34;"Actually, the more I think about it."
01:46:34;01:46:38;"He was an acclaimed jazz vocalist, and this was kind of his breakthrough single."
01:46:38;01:46:42;"1981, hit number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100."
01:47:11;01:47:23;"Some nice fluid synth playing."
01:47:23;01:47:24;"Yeah."
01:47:24;01:47:26;"Some good wheel action."
01:47:31;01:47:35;"'81, so Korg synths?"
01:47:35;01:47:37;"I guess there were some Korgs."
01:47:37;01:47:38;"And what's that?"
01:47:38;01:47:41;"Is that like a Yamaha CP whatever?"
01:47:41;01:47:42;"I don't think so."
01:47:42;01:47:44;"But I know what you mean, CP-70."
01:47:44;01:47:46;"Or is it just a Rhodes?"
01:47:46;01:47:48;"There's a lot of times where I always think it's something different."
01:47:48;01:47:50;"It's just a Rhodes."
01:47:50;01:47:53;"I always want to be like extra, like, mm."
01:47:53;01:47:55;"But there's a lot of different ways to produce a Rhodes."
01:47:55;01:47:56;"Yep."
01:47:56;01:48:00;"Why do I know Al Jarreau's name and not know really why I know it?"
01:48:00;01:48:03;"Probably just in your blood is Wisconsin, man."
01:48:08;01:48:11;"This is pretty, like, sophisticated for a pop hit."
01:48:11;01:48:13;"For a hit, yeah."
01:48:13;01:48:15;"I only died a couple years ago."
01:48:15;01:48:21;"He played with Miles Davis or sang Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Dave Sanborn."
01:48:21;01:48:23;"I got a question for you."
01:48:23;01:48:24;"Yeah."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"Thinking of '80s music and '80s synths."
01:48:26;01:48:28;"So it's interesting that you've been getting into the dead lately,"
01:48:28;01:48:32;"and also you've worked with Hornsby,"
01:48:32;01:48:35;"and you're on record as being a massive Hornsby fan, right?"
01:48:35;01:48:40;"But the Hornsby/Dead connection didn't really mean much to you back in the day?"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"No, I knew that he was in it."
01:48:42;01:48:43;"I just thought that was cool."
01:48:43;01:48:45;"But again, it was just off radar."
01:48:45;01:48:47;"The Dead was just off radar."
01:48:47;01:48:49;"But you were going super deep on his work."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"Oh, yeah."
01:48:50;01:48:53;"I definitely asked him some questions, and, oh, boy, he had some great stories."
01:48:53;01:48:54;"Yeah."
01:48:54;01:48:57;"A really tiny version was Woody Harrelson was out on tour with the Dead."
01:48:57;01:48:58;"Yeah."
01:48:58;01:49:00;"And Bruce plays this MIDI accordion."
01:49:00;01:49:02;"Oh, yeah, I've seen footage of that."
01:49:02;01:49:06;"And it just, like, sits, and Bruce is sitting at the Steinway playing."
01:49:06;01:49:09;"They had early in-ears, you know, like after a while."
01:49:09;01:49:10;"And Bruce is just playing."
01:49:10;01:49:12;"He really--Bruce didn't get in-ears."
01:49:12;01:49:13;"He just had to play without them."
01:49:13;01:49:14;"Yeah."
01:49:14;01:49:16;"And he's just like--Jerry's right at the end of his piano."
01:49:16;01:49:20;"Bruce was playing, and he just said--Jerry looked around with this scowl"
01:49:20;01:49:24;"or, like, this complete distaste face."
01:49:24;01:49:26;"He's looking right at Bruce like, ""What are you doing, man?"""
01:49:26;01:49:27;"He's like, ""I'm just playing."""
01:49:27;01:49:32;"And he looks over, and Woody Harrelson is, like, sitting on the MIDI keyboard"
01:49:32;01:49:34;"that's, like, the controller for the thing."
01:49:34;01:49:35;"Oh, just like--"
01:49:35;01:49:37;"So just the front of house is just--"
01:49:37;01:49:38;"[imitates keyboard]"
01:49:38;01:49:40;"You know, like a bunch of notes."
01:49:40;01:49:43;"And, of course, like proper dad joke vibe."
01:49:43;01:49:46;"Hornsby's like, ""And that was the time that Woody Harrelson sat in with the Dead."""
01:49:46;01:49:47;"[laughs]"
01:49:47;01:49:48;"That--"
01:49:48;01:49:49;"[laughs]"
01:49:49;01:49:50;"Pretty good storyteller, Bruce."
01:49:50;01:49:51;"That's great."
01:49:51;01:49:54;"So then was there some secret Jerry Woody Harrelson beef?"
01:49:54;01:49:55;"[laughs]"
01:49:55;01:49:58;"Probably--he probably forgave him, I have this feeling."
01:49:58;01:49:59;"I find that a lot."
01:49:59;01:50:02;"Not that I've ever had anybody do something as egregious on that."
01:50:02;01:50:05;"But, you know, sometimes when you're on stage, you're in front of people."
01:50:05;01:50:07;"You can feel a little bit vulnerable."
01:50:07;01:50:09;"Hopefully things are going good, and you're feeling confident and stuff."
01:50:09;01:50:14;"But, you know, if something gets messed up, somebody makes a mistake or something,"
01:50:14;01:50:18;"and it throws you off or, you know, you're like, ""Oh, man, they messed me."""
01:50:18;01:50:22;"I do find that one nice thing is that I can have these, like, moments of, like,"
01:50:22;01:50:25;"panic on stage where I'm just like, ""This can never happen again."
01:50:25;01:50:26;"I'm so upset."
01:50:26;01:50:30;"I feel like I was put in a vulnerable position because this or that didn't work."""
01:50:30;01:50:33;"And every time the show's over, I never think of it again."
01:50:33;01:50:34;"No, right."
01:50:34;01:50:38;"The relief of coming off stage and that the show worked is so strong"
01:50:38;01:50:41;"that your frame of mind--it's like you don't even remember the person"
01:50:41;01:50:46;"who was so upset, stewing for that 15 seconds in the middle of a song."
01:50:46;01:50:47;"Exactly."
01:50:47;01:50:49;"I can imagine Jerry, like, on stage just, like, looking at him like, ""What the f---?"""
01:50:49;01:50:51;"Then afterwards, just like--"
01:50:51;01:50:52;"Doing heroin."
01:50:52;01:50:53;"Yeah."
01:50:53;01:50:55;"Yeah, I used to use ""Checked Out."""
01:50:55;01:50:58;"I mean, the time when Hornsby played with him, I think were pretty dark days."
01:50:58;01:50:59;"Very."
01:50:59;01:51:00;"I mean, he was--"
01:51:00;01:51:01;"Yeah, it must have been heavy."
01:51:01;01:51:02;"He was dying every day, I think, man."
01:51:02;01:51:03;"It was crazy."
01:51:03;01:51:04;"Sad."
01:51:04;01:51:06;"I wonder if Jerry watched ""Cheers."""
01:51:06;01:51:08;"I bet you could find out."
01:51:08;01:51:10;"Did Jerry watch ""Cheers""?"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"The number two biggest song to ever come out of ""Jersey."""
01:51:12;01:51:14;"These are the Jersey Boys, ""Frankie Valli"" and ""The Four Seasons."""
01:51:14;01:51:15;"Oh."
01:51:15;01:51:17;"I've always loved this song."
01:51:17;01:51:19;"Their '70s comeback."
01:51:25;01:51:27;"Oh, ""Happy House."""
01:51:27;01:51:29;"This is like the Italian fan of ""House."""
01:51:32;01:51:39;"This is also a song where I love the verse so much, and the chorus or bridge or whatever, I could take or leave."
01:51:39;01:51:43;"This is like the type of thing I remember just, like, being a kid, listening to, like, my little radio at night,"
01:51:43;01:51:47;"and, like, a song like this would come on, I'd just be, like, overwhelmed by emotion."
01:51:57;01:52:00;"This also has such perfect, like, comeback song energy."
01:52:00;01:52:03;"Like, there are these '60s guys, and then, like, the '70s, they write this song."
01:52:03;01:52:04;"It's like, oh, hell yeah."
01:52:08;01:52:10;"I don't like this part that much."
01:52:10;01:52:12;"But whatever, you got to, you know."
01:52:20;01:52:24;"I could picture, like, a Bon Iver ballad cover of this."
01:52:24;01:52:25;"Okay."
01:52:25;01:52:28;"Let's try to get that together by the next leg of the tour."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"You got it."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"Yeah, thank you."
01:52:48;01:52:49;"So good."
01:52:49;01:52:52;"There's something so straightforward, too, about, oh, what a night."
01:52:52;01:52:55;"Just, like, I also remember, what did he say in the beginning?"
01:52:55;01:52:59;"He goes, that was a very special time for me or something."
01:52:59;01:53:02;"What a very special time for me."
01:53:02;01:53:03;"Not really waxing poetic at all."
01:53:03;01:53:06;"Well, you're not trying to make some big, grandiose statement about, like,"
01:53:06;01:53:10;"it's not like one of those kind of pop songs, like, Van Morrison,"
01:53:10;01:53:12;"""Brown-Eyed Girl,"" that really makes you think of, like,"
01:53:12;01:53:14;"the painful nature of time and memory."
01:53:14;01:53:16;"It's just, oh, what a night."
01:53:16;01:53:17;"Yeah, yeah."
01:53:17;01:53:18;"What a nice night."
01:53:18;01:53:20;"Yeah, not that feeling of, like, the good times are over, man."
01:53:20;01:53:21;"It's not 1963 anymore."
01:53:21;01:53:23;"It's like, you know what?"
01:53:23;01:53:25;"That was a hell of a lady, a hell of a night."
01:53:25;01:53:26;"It was a special time for me."
01:53:26;01:53:27;"What do you want me to do?"
01:53:27;01:53:28;"And that's how it feels."
01:53:28;01:53:29;"When that piano comes in."
01:53:29;01:53:31;"Oh, yeah."
01:53:31;01:53:32;"Oh, what a night."
01:53:32;01:53:34;"Dun, dun, dun, bum, bum."
01:53:34;01:53:36;"Late December."
01:53:36;01:53:37;"I was like, late December."
01:53:37;01:53:39;"1963."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"What a very special time."
01:53:41;01:53:42;"I have a song about late December."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"Maybe this is where I got it from."
01:53:44;01:53:47;"I always find out that I've ripped a song off later."
01:53:47;01:53:49;"Yeah."
01:53:49;01:53:52;"Oh, what a night."
01:53:52;01:53:56;"And oh, I didn't even know her name."
01:53:56;01:53:58;"I didn't even know her name."
01:53:58;01:54:00;"That's kind of dark."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"I was never going to be the same."
01:54:02;01:54:06;"What a lady, what a night."
01:54:06;01:54:08;"It is so simple."
01:54:08;01:54:09;"I love it."
01:54:09;01:54:12;"The number one song out of Wisconsin, and this is crazy,"
01:54:12;01:54:16;"because this is actually a person I wanted to ask you about."
01:54:16;01:54:18;"I didn't know that he was from Wisconsin."
01:54:18;01:54:19;"I associate him with the Bay Area."
01:54:19;01:54:23;"I hate to say it, but it's Steve Miller, the Joker."
01:54:23;01:54:24;"Oh, that's right."
01:54:24;01:54:25;"He's from Madison."
01:54:25;01:54:26;"Yeah."
01:54:26;01:54:28;"Steve Miller, band formed in California."
01:54:28;01:54:31;"Now, I'll give credit where credit's due."
01:54:31;01:54:32;"This is a great song."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"Steve Miller rules."
01:54:34;01:54:37;"And this is a great recording too."
01:54:37;01:54:40;"Some people call me Maurice."
01:54:40;01:54:42;"[imitates a car engine]"
01:54:42;01:54:45;"But I speak of the pompitous of love."
01:54:45;01:54:49;"Pompitous of love, great lyric."
01:54:49;01:54:52;"People talk about me, baby."
01:54:52;01:54:56;"I have a cool drum sound, and the acoustic has so much texture."
01:54:56;01:54:57;"Okay, but here's the thing."
01:54:57;01:54:59;"Okay."
01:54:59;01:55:02;"Steve Miller's a bit of an enemy of the show."
01:55:02;01:55:03;"Really?"
01:55:03;01:55:07;"And as a newly minted deadhead, I think you need to know this."
01:55:07;01:55:09;"We're about to test your loyalties."
01:55:09;01:55:10;"Ooh, [bleep]"
01:55:10;01:55:11;"We were doing some research."
01:55:11;01:55:13;"Like I said, the dead come up a lot on the show."
01:55:13;01:55:16;"And, you know, Steve Miller and the dead,"
01:55:16;01:55:19;"they came up together in the Bay Area in the late '60s,"
01:55:19;01:55:20;"you know, doing their thing."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"And they even reunited in the early '90s."
01:55:22;01:55:24;"You see it--I'm often reminded of it"
01:55:24;01:55:26;"because I see T-shirts from that tour."
01:55:26;01:55:29;"Maybe even Hornsby might have been around then."
01:55:29;01:55:32;"The Steve Miller band opened for the Grateful Dead."
01:55:32;01:55:34;"You know, this is peak dead playing stadiums and stuff."
01:55:34;01:55:37;"So I'm sure Steve Miller was happy to get the invitation."
01:55:37;01:55:41;"He even sat in with them once or twice, and, you know, he would jam."
01:55:41;01:55:44;"And then we come across a quote from him from the late '90s."
01:55:44;01:55:45;"We all know what happened in 1995."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"Jerry Garcia died."
01:55:47;01:55:49;"And then we find this quote from Steve Miller"
01:55:49;01:55:51;"basically saying how he never f---ed with the dead,"
01:55:51;01:55:53;"and he thought they sucked, basically."
01:55:53;01:55:55;"We haven't actually looked at the article in a long time."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"I don't know if I'm, like, building it up bigger in my mind."
01:55:57;01:56:00;"But he basically said something disparaging about their whole thing."
01:56:00;01:56:01;"Oh, it's even worse than I thought."
01:56:01;01:56:04;"I'm glad we're revisiting this to stoke the fires."
01:56:04;01:56:05;"2008."
01:56:05;01:56:07;"Rocker Steve Miller may have honed his craft in San Francisco"
01:56:07;01:56:08;"during the late 1960s,"
01:56:08;01:56:11;"but don't lump him in with the local bands from that time."
01:56:11;01:56:13;"Oh, yeah, what a terrible thing to be,"
01:56:13;01:56:15;"lumped in with the bands of late '60s San Francisco,"
01:56:15;01:56:17;"especially the Grateful Dead."
01:56:17;01:56:20;"""I couldn't stand that band,"" Miller said on Thursday"
01:56:20;01:56:22;"during a panel at a music industry symposium,"
01:56:22;01:56:25;"recalling the dead's ""interminable jams"""
01:56:25;01:56:28;"and ""lengthy tuning breaks between songs."""
01:56:28;01:56:29;"That's, like, the kind of thing when you're just, like,"
01:56:29;01:56:32;"so jealous of something you have to just zoom in on something,"
01:56:32;01:56:33;"like, that nobody gives a f--- about."
01:56:33;01:56:37;"And it was very unprofessional how long they would take to tune."
01:56:37;01:56:39;"In fact, Miller said it was more interesting"
01:56:39;01:56:41;"to listen to frontman Jerry Garcia's stage banter"
01:56:41;01:56:44;"than to listen to the band play its psychedelic improvisations."
01:56:44;01:56:47;"""The San Francisco music scene was more of a social phenomenon,"
01:56:47;01:56:48;"blah, blah, blah."
01:56:48;01:56:50;"At first, you come across this quote, and you're like,"
01:56:50;01:56:52;"'Okay, you didn't like the dead,' but then you're like,"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"'You held your tongue for decades"
01:56:54;01:56:57;"when they were the biggest touring band in the world."
01:56:57;01:56:58;"You would happily get up on stage"
01:56:58;01:56:59;"and jam with them and do your thing."
01:56:59;01:57:03;"And then years after the tragic death of Jerry Garcia,"
01:57:03;01:57:05;"now you're gonna let loose with this s--- talk?"
01:57:05;01:57:07;"Huh. I think you missed your window, man."
01:57:07;01:57:09;"You could have said it to his face."
01:57:09;01:57:11;"And look, I'm always willing to believe"
01:57:11;01:57:13;"there's more to the story, and we have reached out,"
01:57:13;01:57:16;"I believe that our guy Seinfeld2000 has DM'd"
01:57:16;01:57:18;"Steve Miller's Twitter account."
01:57:18;01:57:19;"You get nothing back."
01:57:19;01:57:20;"Huh. Guy doesn't give a f---."
01:57:20;01:57:23;"Yeah, I mean, certain point you have to stop giving a f--- maybe."
01:57:23;01:57:24;"You don't have to choose between"
01:57:24;01:57:26;"Steve Miller Band and the dead, though, do you?"
01:57:26;01:57:27;"I think you do now."
01:57:27;01:57:29;"F---. You used to not have to make that choice."
01:57:29;01:57:30;"You were living in a fantasy land"
01:57:30;01:57:32;"where you could just throw on classic rock radio"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"and hear the dead next to Steve Miller Band"
01:57:34;01:57:38;"and say it's all good, San Francisco-based classic rock."
01:57:38;01:57:40;"Now you know something. There's a moral choice to make."
01:57:40;01:57:44;"How about this? Steve Miller wrote more good songs"
01:57:44;01:57:46;"than the Grateful Dead did."
01:57:46;01:57:47;"[explosion]"
01:57:47;01:57:49;"I strongly disagree."
01:57:49;01:57:50;"[laughter]"
01:57:50;01:57:52;"""Fly Like an Eagle,"" ""Swingtown,"""
01:57:52;01:57:53;"[imitates drum roll]"
01:57:53;01:57:54;"they're amazing."
01:57:54;01:57:56;"However, I saw Steve Miller Band and Joe Cocker"
01:57:56;01:58:00;"at the Target Center not that long ago, before Joe died."
01:58:00;01:58:02;"And just so people know, Target Center's an arena"
01:58:02;01:58:04;"in Minneapolis, just in case people thought"
01:58:04;01:58:05;"you were just doing some shopping."
01:58:05;01:58:06;"[laughter]"
01:58:06;01:58:08;"They both played at the Target, like, pharmacy."
01:58:08;01:58:09;"No, you were just there--"
01:58:09;01:58:10;"At the popcorn stand."
01:58:10;01:58:12;"Yeah, you were just there picking up paper towels"
01:58:12;01:58:14;"and you saw Joe Cocker and Steve Miller,"
01:58:14;01:58:16;"for some reason, they were shopping together."
01:58:16;01:58:17;"In Eau Claire."
01:58:17;01:58:18;"Yeah."
01:58:18;01:58:21;"But Joe Cocker kicked the living s--- out of Steve Miller,"
01:58:21;01:58:23;"and it was embarrassing for Steve Miller."
01:58:23;01:58:24;"He had a powerful voice."
01:58:24;01:58:26;"Yeah, I mean, he just crushed it."
01:58:26;01:58:29;"And so there's a way to say that Steve Miller"
01:58:29;01:58:32;"should be embarrassed of himself in a lot of ways,"
01:58:32;01:58:34;"but boy, did he crush it."
01:58:34;01:58:36;"But--and this is the nice thing I'll say about the dead."
01:58:36;01:58:37;"Yeah."
01:58:37;01:58:40;"Like I said before, one of the only truly visionary people"
01:58:40;01:58:43;"or bands that America has really ever had."
01:58:43;01:58:44;"Right."
01:58:44;01:58:46;"And Steve Miller isn't even close to that."
01:58:46;01:58:48;"If I read between the lines, you know,"
01:58:48;01:58:50;"like we said earlier on the program,"
01:58:50;01:58:52;"hurt people hurt people."
01:58:52;01:58:55;"When you zoom in on what you perceive to be"
01:58:55;01:58:57;"somebody else's flaws, it often has to do with the fact--"
01:58:57;01:59:00;"why are you not chill enough just to live and let live, you know?"
01:59:00;01:59:02;"What is it about--and you look at Steve Miller,"
01:59:02;01:59:05;"maybe he felt like, I wrote the number one"
01:59:05;01:59:08;"biggest Wisconsin billboard hit."
01:59:08;01:59:10;"He probably feels pretty pleased with himself."
01:59:10;01:59:11;"And you're right, the Grateful Dead,"
01:59:11;01:59:13;"they have all sorts of iconic songs, but it's like,"
01:59:13;01:59:15;"what's their version of the Joker, ""Fly Like an Eagle,"""
01:59:15;01:59:17;"like ""Touch of Gray"" or ""Truckin'"" or something?"
01:59:17;01:59:21;"Again, the Grateful Dead, it's like the body of work is so immense."
01:59:21;01:59:23;"Maybe they don't have those types of songs"
01:59:23;01:59:25;"that are burned into the public consciousness."
01:59:25;01:59:26;"That's what I'm saying."
01:59:26;01:59:27;"Well, and I bet Steve Miller felt the same way,"
01:59:27;01:59:30;"so he probably felt like, okay, I wrote the f---ing Joker,"
01:59:30;01:59:34;"I wrote ""Fly Like an Eagle,"" and here I am in 1991"
01:59:34;01:59:39;"opening for these guys who somehow drew 97,000 people"
01:59:39;01:59:43;"to this stadium in whatever, Nevada."
01:59:43;01:59:48;"So there's probably a part of him that he's happy to get his opener check,"
01:59:48;01:59:50;"and he's happy to go strut his stuff on stage"
01:59:50;01:59:52;"when Bobby invites him out, but then he's still--"
01:59:52;01:59:54;"But he's hung up on something, isn't he?"
01:59:54;01:59:56;"He's hung up on something, then 20 years later,"
01:59:56;01:59:59;"when finally guitar god Jerry Garcia's dead,"
01:59:59;02:00:01;"now he knows nobody's going to come for him."
02:00:01;02:00:03;"Then finally, yeah, the things that he zooms in on"
02:00:03;02:00:05;"is kind of like, oh, with the jamming."
02:00:05;02:00:09;"So yeah, he's putting them down for jamming and for tuning."
02:00:09;02:00:11;"So there's probably a part of him that's like,"
02:00:11;02:00:13;"yeah, they never wrote the Joker."
02:00:13;02:00:16;"Oh, yeah, they convinced a bunch of drug-addled hippies"
02:00:16;02:00:19;"to dance in circles while they jammed."
02:00:19;02:00:21;"Personally, I found it interminable."
02:00:21;02:00:23;"That's the thing that got him because he knew"
02:00:23;02:00:25;"part of the jam thing is that they built a culture."
02:00:25;02:00:27;"There's something more visionary about building a culture"
02:00:27;02:00:29;"than writing ""Fly Like an Eagle."""
02:00:29;02:00:31;"Yeah, there's not much visionary with ""Fly Like an Eagle."""
02:00:31;02:00:33;"It's just a bitchin' song."
02:00:33;02:00:35;"I mean, the synth part is visionary."
02:00:35;02:00:37;"I don't even know if he did that."
02:00:37;02:00:38;"That's true."
02:00:38;02:00:40;"[imitates synth]"
02:00:40;02:00:42;"That might just have been another guy in the Steve Miller band."
02:00:42;02:00:44;"That's the synth man."
02:00:44;02:00:46;"Who else is in the Steve Miller band, by the way?"
02:00:46;02:00:48;"I bet some pretty cool guys."
02:00:48;02:00:50;"Yeah, but once again, he kind of had to put his name on it."
02:00:50;02:00:52;"Maybe he is hurt."
02:00:52;02:00:53;"I mean, there was Jerry Garcia band,"
02:00:53;02:00:55;"but that was kind of a secondary thing for fun."
02:00:55;02:00:56;"Mm-hmm."
02:00:56;02:00:58;"Okay, but you at least agree that that was very rude"
02:00:58;02:01:00;"that he said that."
02:01:00;02:01:02;"Yeah, unnecessary as [bleep] for sure."
02:01:02;02:01:04;"Yeah. Do you have any connection to him?"
02:01:04;02:01:05;"No."
02:01:05;02:01:07;"Outside of the Wisconsin--"
02:01:07;02:01:08;"the Wisconsin connection."
02:01:08;02:01:10;"I'm just trying to, like, not get involved."
02:01:10;02:01:12;"[laughs]"
02:01:12;02:01:14;"Can't be neutral on a moving train."
02:01:14;02:01:16;"Yeah, you're right. You're right."
02:01:16;02:01:18;"This is a kind of-- it's a wonderful life scenario."
02:01:18;02:01:19;"Sure."
02:01:19;02:01:21;"Hopefully you die at a ripe old age,"
02:01:21;02:01:23;"but let's say I take your soul,"
02:01:23;02:01:25;"and we show you what the world looks like without you."
02:01:25;02:01:26;"Yeah."
02:01:26;02:01:28;"And then 10 years later,"
02:01:28;02:01:30;"I'm like, ""Oh, man, I'm gonna meet Sharon Van Etten"
02:01:30;02:01:32;"on a music industry panel."""
02:01:32;02:01:34;"They're saying, ""Oh, yeah, you used to be"
02:01:34;02:01:36;"tight with the Boney Ver, you know,"
02:01:36;02:01:38;"and Justin Vernon."""
02:01:38;02:01:40;"I say, like, ""Oh, man, their live show,"
02:01:40;02:01:43;"'Interminable,' couldn't stand them."""
02:01:43;02:01:44;"That would get your goat, right?"
02:01:44;02:01:46;"I don't know, man. Not really."
02:01:46;02:01:47;"That wouldn't get your goat?"
02:01:47;02:01:48;"I don't think so."
02:01:48;02:01:49;"I mean, first of all, Sharon--"
02:01:49;02:01:51;"How could that not get your goat?"
02:01:51;02:01:53;"Because I just don't care, honestly."
02:01:53;02:01:54;"I mean, first of all, Sharon wouldn't,"
02:01:54;02:01:56;"'cause we're buddies, and she's too nice."
02:01:56;02:01:57;"That's what Jerry thought about."
02:01:57;02:01:58;"Oh, Steve."
02:01:58;02:01:59;"Now I feel really bad."
02:01:59;02:02:01;"Yeah, I agree."
02:02:01;02:02:03;"I can't picture her pulling a Steve Miller,"
02:02:03;02:02:05;"but I just find it interesting."
02:02:05;02:02:06;"When people are giving you s--t,"
02:02:06;02:02:08;"I find it kind of more--"
02:02:08;02:02:10;"it gives me more credit,"
02:02:10;02:02:12;"'cause if somebody's, like, really into your s--t,"
02:02:12;02:02:14;"I also don't know what to do with that."
02:02:14;02:02:16;"But at least when somebody, like, hates your stuff,"
02:02:16;02:02:17;"at least it's kind of funny."
02:02:17;02:02:19;"At least it's a point of view."
02:02:19;02:02:20;"I don't mind it at all."
02:02:20;02:02:21;"It doesn't get at my ego at all."
02:02:21;02:02:22;"It's fun."
02:02:22;02:02:24;"I follow this guy on Twitter called BoneverBlows."
02:02:24;02:02:25;"Yeah?"
02:02:25;02:02:26;"He's pretty funny."
02:02:26;02:02:27;"He actually doesn't like Bonever?"
02:02:27;02:02:28;"Hates it."
02:02:28;02:02:29;"Straight up?"
02:02:29;02:02:30;"Yeah."
02:02:30;02:02:32;"What does he think about the fact that you follow him?"
02:02:32;02:02:33;"We talk all the time."
02:02:33;02:02:35;"We've talked on Twitter for years and years."
02:02:35;02:02:37;"So you'd be like, ""New album, man."
02:02:37;02:02:38;"Check out the new album."""
02:02:38;02:02:39;"Yeah, it's a lot of, like--"
02:02:39;02:02:41;"And I'd be like, ""Nope, still sucks."""
02:02:41;02:02:42;"Sucks."
02:02:42;02:02:43;"[laughs]"
02:02:43;02:02:44;"Well, okay."
02:02:44;02:02:46;"This is the last thing I'll say about it."
02:02:46;02:02:47;"[laughs]"
02:02:47;02:02:50;"I've always felt, too, that regular people--"
02:02:50;02:02:52;"the fans, the audience--"
02:02:52;02:02:54;"those are the people who should hate s--t."
02:02:54;02:02:55;"They hate Bonever, they hate Van Pergen,"
02:02:55;02:02:56;"they hate The Grateful Dead,"
02:02:56;02:02:57;"they hate Steve Miller, whatever."
02:02:57;02:03:00;"That's where you have to really check your ego and say,"

02:03:03;02:03:05;"showing my wares to the world."""
02:03:05;02:03:07;"And you step into the marketplace,"

02:03:17;02:03:18;"You're allowed to do that."
02:03:18;02:03:21;"And even in the early days when I just see"
02:03:21;02:03:23;"just some random person on social media"
02:03:23;02:03:24;"just being like, ""Your band sucks,"""

02:03:26;02:03:28;"""That's what you're supposed to do."""
02:03:28;02:03:30;"But again, it's the disloyalty,"
02:03:30;02:03:32;"it's the two-facedness,"
02:03:32;02:03:33;"and also just the sadness."
02:03:33;02:03:35;"I guess 'cause Jerry died young,"
02:03:35;02:03:37;"but the idea that he unknowingly brought a viper"
02:03:37;02:03:39;"into his den."
02:03:39;02:03:40;"[laughs]"
02:03:40;02:03:41;"You know what I mean?"
02:03:41;02:03:43;"I just think, like--"
02:03:43;02:03:45;"I don't want to say Sharon Van Etten again,"
02:03:45;02:03:47;"'cause it's actually, even as a hypothetical, too harsh."
02:03:47;02:03:50;"Let's just say Steve Miller opened a few dates for you."
02:03:50;02:03:51;"I just think--"
02:03:51;02:03:53;"It's just something about that--"
02:03:53;02:03:54;"You know, there's an intimacy"
02:03:54;02:03:56;"when you share the stage with somebody."
02:03:56;02:03:57;"This would almost be like finding out"
02:03:57;02:04:00;"that one of the trombone dudes from Virginia"
02:04:00;02:04:02;"was like, ""Terrible horn arrangements."
02:04:02;02:04:03;"I don't understand."""
02:04:03;02:04:05;"Yeah, right, right, right, right, right, right."
02:04:05;02:04:07;"That's not taste. That's betrayal."
02:04:07;02:04:09;"Oh, absolutely. I agree."
02:04:09;02:04:12;"So will you sign this letter to President Trump"
02:04:12;02:04:15;"condemning Steve Miller?"
02:04:15;02:04:17;"No, man, I can't."
02:04:17;02:04:20;"Kim Kardashian has a signed letter"
02:04:20;02:04:24;"she's taking to President Trump for their next meeting."
02:04:24;02:04:26;"Will you add your name?"

02:04:31;02:04:32;"Oh, Variety."
02:04:32;02:04:34;"[laughter]"
02:04:34;02:04:36;"I can't count on your support."
02:04:36;02:04:37;"No."
02:04:37;02:04:39;"Okay, no, but I like your philosophy."
02:04:39;02:04:40;"Yeah."
02:04:40;02:04:41;"All right."
02:04:41;02:04:42;"Steve Miller."
02:04:42;02:04:44;"Well, you know what? Here's my hope."
02:04:44;02:04:46;"Here's my Christmas wish for the world."
02:04:46;02:04:47;"I hope that one day,"
02:04:47;02:04:50;"the biggest Billboard hit out of Wisconsin"
02:04:50;02:04:51;"is a Boney Vare song."
02:04:51;02:04:52;"Aww."
02:04:52;02:04:55;"Because A, you are one of the great Wisconsin musicians"
02:04:55;02:04:58;"of all time, and B, I can't wait to see the look"
02:04:58;02:05:01;"on that prick's face when he gets knocked off the top."
02:05:01;02:05:03;"What I will do, what I will do is--"
02:05:03;02:05:05;"let's say this happens at some point, right?"
02:05:05;02:05:07;"What I will do is I'll show up."
02:05:07;02:05:10;"We can fly to Madison together"
02:05:10;02:05:13;"and find his childhood home and, like, take a piss on it"
02:05:13;02:05:15;"or bring a flower or, like--"
02:05:15;02:05:16;"Yeah."
02:05:16;02:05:19;"Do something that is sort of funny but also really mean."
02:05:19;02:05:21;"Or just something that's deserved."
02:05:21;02:05:22;"Yeah."
02:05:23;02:05:25;"But also, you know, I'm serious about this."
02:05:25;02:05:28;"Maybe go for more of a pop direction on the next album."
02:05:28;02:05:29;"Just something for the--"
02:05:29;02:05:32;"I am not going to be able to not think about that, so yeah."
02:05:32;02:05:33;"All right."
02:05:33;02:05:34;"You got it."
02:05:34;02:05:35;"Now you know--"
02:05:35;02:05:36;"I got a sample of Clash Drums."
02:05:36;02:05:37;"This is like in this weird--"
02:05:37;02:05:39;"I don't know why I keep thinking of Christmas."
02:05:39;02:05:41;"Maybe it's this weird ""It's a Wonderful Life"" movie"
02:05:41;02:05:43;"where I take you through the top five songs,"
02:05:43;02:05:45;"top five highest-charting Wisconsin songs,"
02:05:45;02:05:47;"and you learn a little lesson from each one of them."
02:05:47;02:05:49;"Cuckoo Cow teaches you something."
02:05:49;02:05:50;"Garbage."
02:05:50;02:05:52;"And you use that to defeat the evil Steve Miller"
02:05:52;02:05:54;"to make the biggest Wisconsin song of all time."
02:05:54;02:05:55;"Exactly."
02:05:55;02:05:59;"I'm like an avalanche, picking up speed."
02:05:59;02:06:02;"Now for the biggest song ever out of New Jersey."
02:06:02;02:06:03;"Springsteen?"
02:06:03;02:06:05;"It's not Springsteen, actually."
02:06:05;02:06:06;"I feel like Bruce--"
02:06:06;02:06:08;"he only probably has one or two number-one hits."
02:06:08;02:06:09;"Yeah, probably."
02:06:09;02:06:10;"Many, many hits."
02:06:10;02:06:12;"Probably ""Dancing in the Dark"" or something."
02:06:12;02:06:13;"But again, we had to go by--"
02:06:13;02:06:14;"it was an embarrassment of riches."
02:06:14;02:06:17;"We had to go by how long it sat on the top of the charts."
02:06:17;02:06:18;"It's funny."
02:06:18;02:06:19;"New Jersey's so dense."
02:06:19;02:06:20;"Even when you're talking about Wisconsin,"
02:06:20;02:06:21;"you're like, you know, actually,"
02:06:21;02:06:23;"Milwaukee's pretty far from Eau Claire."
02:06:23;02:06:27;"But I always think about where I grew up in New Jersey,"
02:06:27;02:06:28;"especially northern New Jersey,"
02:06:28;02:06:31;"it's the cluster around New York,"
02:06:31;02:06:32;"so it's incredibly dense."
02:06:32;02:06:35;"This is a fun fact that I drop from time to time."
02:06:35;02:06:37;"New Jersey has more towns than California."
02:06:37;02:06:38;"Wow."
02:06:38;02:06:39;"'Cause it's like every mile."
02:06:39;02:06:41;"It's like now you're in Paramus."
02:06:41;02:06:42;"Now you're in Clifton, whatever."
02:06:42;02:06:43;"Wow."
02:06:43;02:06:45;"Oh, Bruce has never had a number-one single."
02:06:45;02:06:48;"""Streets of Philadelphia"" hit number two on the British charts."
02:06:48;02:06:50;"""Dancing in the Dark"" hit number two on Billboard."
02:06:50;02:06:51;"Wow."
02:06:51;02:06:52;"Damn, Bruce."
02:06:52;02:06:53;"He's like the biggest artist of all time, though."
02:06:53;02:06:54;"I love that."
02:06:54;02:06:55;"Yeah, many hit singles."
02:06:55;02:06:56;"I love that intricacy."
02:06:56;02:06:57;"Yeah."
02:06:57;02:06:59;"But I always think about how even when I would learn"
02:06:59;02:07:00;"about where people are from in Jersey,"
02:07:00;02:07:04;"it's like within literally like a 15-square-mile radius,"
02:07:04;02:07:08;"all these people like Paul Simon, Frank Sinatra were born."
02:07:08;02:07:09;"I remember one time realizing,"
02:07:09;02:07:12;"'cause Tom Cruise grew up partially in the town I grew up in,"
02:07:12;02:07:14;"people don't really think of him as a Jersey guy,"
02:07:14;02:07:16;"but he went to the same high school,"
02:07:16;02:07:18;"and I kind of remember realizing like,"
02:07:18;02:07:20;"""Whoa, within literally three-square-miles,"
02:07:20;02:07:22;"""Tom Cruise and all these people,"
02:07:22;02:07:23;"""just 'cause these towns are stuck together."""
02:07:23;02:07:25;"And one of the major people who grew up"
02:07:25;02:07:28;"essentially one town over was Whitney Houston."
02:07:28;02:07:30;"She grew up in East Orange."
02:07:30;02:07:32;"I think she was born in Newark."
02:07:32;02:07:34;"Wow, Whitney Houston, Paul Simon,"
02:07:34;02:07:37;"Philip Roth, Gloria Gaynor, all born in Newark."
02:07:37;02:07:38;"Major city."
02:07:38;02:07:39;"Major."
02:07:39;02:07:41;"So anyway, Whitney Houston grew up in East Orange."
02:07:41;02:07:43;"There was a time where Whitney Houston and Tom Cruise"
02:07:43;02:07:46;"probably could have been going to the same McDonald's or something."
02:07:46;02:07:47;"And her biggest single,"
02:07:47;02:07:49;"do you want to guess what her biggest single"
02:07:49;02:07:52;"that topped the charts for weeks and weeks and weeks was?"
02:07:52;02:07:53;"""I Will Always Love You""?"
02:07:53;02:07:54;"Yeah, exactly."
02:07:54;02:07:56;"And I think this is one of the greatest songs of all time."
02:07:56;02:07:59;"I'm a little more partial to the Dolly Parton version."
02:07:59;02:08:00;"See, I was going to bring up Dolly"
02:08:00;02:08:03;"because I think she's probably the most underrated songwriter"
02:08:03;02:08:04;"of all time."
02:08:04;02:08:05;"Right, 'cause she wrote this song."
02:08:05;02:08:08;"Yeah, but I have to say the Whitney version"
02:08:08;02:08:09;"is slightly better."
02:08:09;02:08:11;"It's so--"
02:08:11;02:08:12;"♪ Bittersweet ♪"
02:08:12;02:08:14;"It's just so powerful."

02:08:17;02:08:18;"That's true."
02:08:18;02:08:19;"But this is powerful, and actually,"
02:08:19;02:08:21;"I watched the Whitney Houston doc recently,"
02:08:21;02:08:24;"which is very sad and upsetting."
02:08:24;02:08:28;"But one kind of amazing moment is that David Foster,"
02:08:28;02:08:30;"who's the major producer/songwriter who produced this,"
02:08:30;02:08:33;"talks about how Kevin Costner,"
02:08:33;02:08:35;"who always seemed like kind of a funny guy,"
02:08:35;02:08:38;"I also remember in the Madonna doc from the early '90s"
02:08:38;02:08:40;"Truth or Dare, there's a part where he comes backstage"
02:08:40;02:08:42;"to say hi to her, and he's like, ""Your show was really cool."""
02:08:42;02:08:45;"And then he walks away, and she makes, like, the gag."
02:08:45;02:08:46;"She's like, ""Oh."""
02:08:46;02:08:48;"Like, to her, Kevin Costner was such a loser"
02:08:48;02:08:50;"coming backstage to the Madonna show."
02:08:50;02:08:52;"She's wearing, like, the cone bra, like, super cool,"
02:08:52;02:08:54;"and Kevin Costner just, you know, comes back,"
02:08:54;02:08:57;"probably like, ""Your show was really cool, man."""
02:08:57;02:08:58;"And she's like, ""Oh!"""
02:08:58;02:08:59;"Gross."
02:08:59;02:09:01;"So anyway, Kevin Costner doesn't seem like a guy"
02:09:01;02:09:03;"who would probably have good instincts"
02:09:03;02:09:05;"for early '90s pop music if you ask Madonna."

02:11:14;02:11:15;"I always refer to this--"
02:11:15;02:11:17;"you know when you have to do some kind of thing"
02:11:17;02:11:18;"where people are just like, ""What do you think"
02:11:18;02:11:20;"are your top songs of all time?"""
02:11:20;02:11:23;"I always think about this song 'cause we're talking about it"
02:11:23;02:11:26;"as, like, you know, ""Oh, What a Night"" by The Four Seasons."
02:11:26;02:11:27;"Very straightforward."
02:11:27;02:11:30;"But of course, pop music often is very multidimensional."
02:11:30;02:11:32;"You think about a song like ""Brown-Eyed Girl,"""
02:11:32;02:11:35;"upbeat, fun, but really that song's a little bit"
02:11:35;02:11:39;"about the nature of memory and loss and the sentimentality."
02:11:39;02:11:40;"And I always think about this song,"
02:11:40;02:11:41;"""I Will Always Love You."""
02:11:41;02:11:44;"Couldn't be a more straightforward pop title chorus."
02:11:44;02:11:46;"And then you really think about what the song's about,"
02:11:46;02:11:49;"and there's only a few pop songs that I can think of."
02:11:49;02:11:52;"There's a lot of songs that are like, ""I love you,"""
02:11:52;02:11:55;"this is a song about knowing you're not right for somebody"
02:11:55;02:11:58;"and saying goodbye and saying just straight up,"
02:11:58;02:12:01;"""I'm not angry at you. I hope you're not angry at me."""
02:12:01;02:12:05;"It's just fundamentally exploring the painful fabric of life."
02:12:05;02:12:07;"That's how it is sometimes."
02:12:07;02:12:08;"""I will always love you."""
02:12:08;02:12:09;"Very well said."
02:12:09;02:12:11;"It's incredibly moving, too."
02:12:11;02:12:13;"The other song that I think hits on something similar"
02:12:13;02:12:15;"is ABBA, ""The Winner Takes It All."""
02:12:15;02:12:16;"Do you know this song?"
02:12:16;02:12:17;"I don't think so."
02:12:17;02:12:18;"I mean, I probably do, right?"
02:12:18;02:12:20;"It's not, like, top five ABBA."
02:12:20;02:12:22;"It's, like, top 15. They have so many hits."
02:12:22;02:12:25;"That's literally also a song that's just about, like,"
02:12:25;02:12:26;"""I don't want to bother you."""
02:12:26;02:12:27;"This is just how it is."
02:12:27;02:12:34;"♪ And I hope you have all you dreamed of ♪"
02:12:34;02:12:41;"♪ And I wish you joy and happiness ♪"
02:12:41;02:12:50;"♪ But above all this, I wish you love ♪"
02:12:50;02:13:01;"♪ And I will always love you ♪"
02:13:01;02:13:03;"Trying to think of a better vocal performance"
02:13:03;02:13:05;"than any song in any era."
02:13:05;02:13:07;"Yeah, she has such incredible control."
02:13:07;02:13:08;"I mean, yeah, that's like you said."
02:13:08;02:13:11;"That's why she can go 45 seconds."
02:13:11;02:13:14;"Just, like, the way she lets the words taper off,"
02:13:14;02:13:17;"like, such intense control from the top to the bottom."
02:13:17;02:13:20;"I taped this song off the radio when my grandpa died,"
02:13:20;02:13:22;"and I just put it on a tape off the radio, and then I just--"
02:13:22;02:13:24;"Did you die around this era or the '90s?"
02:13:24;02:13:25;"Yeah, yeah."
02:13:25;02:13:28;"Yeah, listened to the tape over and over again"
02:13:28;02:13:29;"on my speakers in my room."
02:13:29;02:13:31;"Because the sentiment felt--"
02:13:31;02:13:32;"Well, yeah, it's just, like, one of the--"
02:13:32;02:13:33;"How you felt, right, yeah."
02:13:33;02:13:36;"One of the early deep emotional sentiments."
02:13:36;02:13:37;"Right."
02:13:37;02:13:39;"I mean, I didn't know what it was about."
02:13:39;02:13:40;"Right."
02:13:40;02:13:42;"I was just like, this feels right."
02:13:42;02:13:43;"Right, you just felt the emotion of it."
02:13:43;02:13:44;"Yeah."
02:13:44;02:13:46;"Actually, the only time--"
02:13:46;02:13:48;"It was such a weird experience going to the Grammys"
02:13:48;02:13:51;"all those years ago, but she died, like, the night before."
02:13:51;02:13:54;"And there was a whole party happening at the--"
02:13:54;02:13:56;"Yeah, they were going to give her an award or something."
02:13:56;02:13:57;"That's why she was at that hotel."
02:13:57;02:13:58;"Yeah."
02:13:58;02:13:59;"Oh, God."
02:13:59;02:14:03;"And then they had given them not a lot of credit over there"
02:14:03;02:14:05;"for their live show production,"
02:14:05;02:14:09;"but getting Jennifer Hudson to do her song was class."
02:14:09;02:14:11;"Right, because they had to throw that together very quickly."
02:14:11;02:14:12;"Yeah."
02:14:12;02:14:14;"Hopefully they bumped Steve Miller."
02:14:14;02:14:16;"[laughter]"
02:14:16;02:14:18;"Oh, that's funny."
02:14:18;02:14:20;"Steve Miller was going to play ""Fly Like an Eagle"""
02:14:20;02:14:24;"with Flo Rida, but then they bumped that"
02:14:24;02:14:26;"for a truly heartfelt tribute."
02:14:26;02:14:29;"You know what sucks so bad is that sounds exactly"
02:14:29;02:14:31;"like something they would try to sell on that show."
02:14:31;02:14:34;"Well, it's fun to see different people get together"
02:14:34;02:14:36;"as long as they didn't talk s--t about Jerry Garcia"
02:14:36;02:14:38;"after he had died."
02:14:38;02:14:40;"I like the mash-up culture."
02:14:40;02:14:41;"Sometimes."
02:14:41;02:14:43;"Sometimes, yeah."
02:14:43;02:14:45;"There have been great performances."
02:14:45;02:14:48;"Well, I will say it's been a pleasure talking to you"
02:14:48;02:14:51;"and it's been a pleasure going through the top hits"
02:14:51;02:14:52;"of our home states."
02:14:52;02:14:54;"Obviously the biggest song out of ""Jersey,"""
02:14:54;02:14:56;"""I Will Always Love You,"" Whitney Houston,"
02:14:56;02:14:58;"""Mops the Floor"" with Steve Miller."
02:14:58;02:14:59;"[laughter]"
02:14:59;02:15:02;"Even though ""The Joker,"" I can't deny that I do think"
02:15:02;02:15:04;"""The Joker"" is a great song, but Whitney Houston"
02:15:04;02:15:07;"just seems like a better person."
02:15:07;02:15:09;"Yeah, a lot more empathy."
02:15:09;02:15:10;"Yeah, RIP."
02:15:10;02:15:11;"No, I had a blast."
02:15:11;02:15:12;"This has been--"
02:15:12;02:15:14;"Well, you're welcome back anytime."
02:15:14;02:15:16;"Now you're part of the Time Crisis family."
02:15:16;02:15:17;"I'm coming back."
02:15:17;02:15:19;"Next time, meet the rest of the crew,"
02:15:19;02:15:23;"Jake, Seinfeld 2000, Winter,"
02:15:23;02:15:25;"if you ever want to go starbucking."
02:15:25;02:15:26;"It's been a real pleasure having you."
02:15:26;02:15:27;"Thank you."
02:15:27;02:15:28;"Really, so fun."
02:15:28;02:15:29;"I will definitely come back."
