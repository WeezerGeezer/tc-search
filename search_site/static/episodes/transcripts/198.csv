00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, back again. On this episode we talk about the biggest movie of the"
00:07;00:15;"summer, Flamin' Hot. We also dive into the mailbag, listen to music from Andy"
00:15;00:25;"Preboy, as well as Shania Twain, LL Cool J, Brandi, and Monica. All this and more on"
00:25;00:32;"this week's Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:17;01:26;"Time Crisis, back again. What's up boys? It's the summer of movie magic, right?"
01:26;01:31;"That's right. Just get right back into it. There's a lot of highly anticipated"
01:31;01:36;"films out, and I've only seen one of them. I haven't seen Mission Impossible, I have"
01:36;01:42;"not seen Oppenheimer, I have not seen Barbie, but I did watch Flamin' Hot."
01:42;01:47;"Which let's keep it real, is the movie of the summer. Mm-hmm. So Seinfeld, you're our"
01:47;01:52;"social media guy, so I've heard that Flamin' Hot just took over the social scene."
01:52;01:58;"Yeah, I've been calling it Flamin' Heimer."
01:58;02:05;"Because you know, that's really the thing. You go see your Flamin' Hot on Hulu,"
02:05;02:12;"then you go to Oppenheimer, shot chaser. I also heard about Flarbenheimer, which is"
02:12;02:16;"when you go see Barbie into Oppenheimer, but the whole time you're just watching"
02:16;02:22;"Flamin' Hot on your phone. A lot of people have been doing that, and I think they"
02:22;02:27;"don't... When you see these big box office returns for Oppenheimer and Barbie, keep"
02:27;02:30;"in mind, yes, a lot of people bought the tickets, but they did not watch the films."
02:30;02:35;"They had the earbuds in, and they were watching Flamin' Hot. Just as Nolan and"
02:35;02:42;"Gerwig intended. That's right. Nolan and Gerwig have to bow down before Longoria."
02:42;02:47;"What you really got to do is you got to bring the MacBook Pro into the"
02:47;02:52;"theater. The iPhone really doesn't give you that resolution that you want on the"
02:52;02:57;"Flamin' Hot, so you bring the MacBook, you watch half during Barbie, then the"
02:57;03:01;"other half during Oppenheimer. Flarbenheimer. Everybody's doing it."
03:01;03:06;"So we've been waiting a long time to... This has been like a year's long journey."
03:06;03:11;"And actually, I was wondering, Jake, because the first time Richard Montanez or"
03:11;03:16;"Flamin' Hot came up was very, I think pretty early days on TC, and you just"
03:16;03:20;"casually were like, ""Did you know Flamin' Hot Cheetos were invented by a Frito-Lay"
03:20;03:22;"janitor?"" Where do you think you heard that?"
03:22;03:28;"I don't remember, man. I just stumbled across that. Did we even stumble across"
03:28;03:32;"it live on air? I don't remember. No, I feel like you just dropped that."
03:32;03:35;"It was like five years ago, six years ago. It was a long time ago."
03:35;03:38;"All I know is that you were the first person I ever heard say that, and then"
03:38;03:43;"next thing I know, Montanez has a book. They announce the movie. There's the"
03:43;03:47;"LA Times takedown. Right."
03:47;03:48;"Then the movie comes out."
03:48;03:52;"And he was very active on social media there for a while, too."
03:52;03:53;"Oh, yeah."
03:53;03:54;"Years ago. Yeah."
03:54;03:57;"And he's in the movie. Did you catch him in the movie?"
03:57;03:59;"I missed him. Where was he?"
03:59;04:00;"His cameo?"
04:00;04:03;"Yeah. You guys didn't catch Montanez's cameo?"
04:03;04:03;"No."
04:03;04:05;"What part?"
04:05;04:11;"There's a section when they're taking it to the streets, and Montanez gets all his"
04:12;04:16;"friends, including some of the old gang-banging friends, to help just get"
04:16;04:22;"Flamin' Hot Cheetos to regular people who didn't know about it. And there's a part where they're"
04:22;04:25;"in a park, and people are having a barbecue, and they're just handing them out to different"
04:25;04:29;"people, including the real Richard Montanez and the real Judy Montanez."
04:29;04:30;"That's killer."
04:30;04:37;"For anybody who doesn't remember, so Flamin' Hot, which came out on Hulu and I think Disney+ on"
04:37;04:43;"June 9th, it's based on Richard Montanez's memoir, A Boy, a Burrito, and a Cookie, from"
04:43;04:49;"Janitor to Executive. Ava Longoria directed the movie. It's her debut. I gotta say, she did a"
04:49;04:50;"good job."
04:50;04:53;"Visually, it was very solid, I thought."
04:53;04:57;"It's very... Look, when you hear about somebody directing their first movie,"
04:57;04:59;"the first thing I'm looking for is just competence."
04:59;05:00;"Yeah."
05:00;05:06;"And she... It's a great debut, and I think we'll be seeing a lot more from her. It was"
05:06;05:11;"extremely competent. Before we get into how everybody felt about the movie, we gotta give"
05:11;05:17;"some props to Ava Longoria, because, yeah, first-time director, controversial subject"
05:17;05:19;"matter, it could go a lot of different ways."
05:19;05:20;"A period piece."
05:20;05:28;"A period piece, yeah. It stars Jesse Garcia, Annie Gonzalez, Dennis Haysbert. Dennis Haysbert,"
05:28;05:31;"a lot of people probably know, is the... What is it? Nationwide insurance guy?"
05:32;05:35;"Yeah. President David Palmer on 24."
05:35;05:40;"Yes, he's also 24. But he's in a major ad campaign."
05:40;05:41;"Yes."
05:41;05:43;"I think he's an Allstate guy."
05:43;05:43;"Allstate."
05:43;05:48;"Allstate, Allstate. That's what I meant. Famous for his deep voice. And then also you got Tony"
05:48;05:55;"Shalhoub playing Roger Enrico, the CEO of Frito-Lay. So when Flamin' Hot came out, it was"
05:55;06:01;"the seventh most streamed film across all platforms. That doesn't sound right. I think"
06:01;06:08;"should be first, but OK, it did pretty well. It holds a 68% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes."
06:08;06:12;"But of course, we know these fat cat critics, you can't trust them. So more importantly,"
06:12;06:20;"the audience score, a Flamin' Hot 90%. The people have spoken. People love the movie."
06:20;06:26;"And for anybody who doesn't remember, as Jake told us back in the day, there's this story that"
06:27;06:33;"Flamin' Hot Cheetos were invented by a Frito-Lay janitor who took a batch home of"
06:33;06:42;"undusted Cheetos and then decided to mix it up in the kitchen with his family, bring some of his"
06:42;06:47;"Mexican heritage to the table and create a new kind of powdered coating for the Cheetos, which"
06:47;06:53;"is the prototype for what we now know as Flamin' Hot Cheetos. It's a great story. We're all big"
06:53;06:59;"fans of Richard Montanez. And one thing's indisputable. He did somehow go from being a"
06:59;07:09;"janitor and into a machinist at Frito-Lay into being a major executive in charge of marketing."
07:09;07:15;"Nobody disputes that. And that alone is an interesting story. Where things get a little"
07:15;07:21;"spicy is that he writes his book. More and more people are starting to talk about this"
07:22;07:28;"incredible story of the janitor to executive and not just that, the invention of Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
07:28;07:32;"And as that story becomes more mainstream, they announced the movie. After the movie's announced,"
07:32;07:39;"there is this big takedown in the LA Times where a journalist, they basically say that Montanez's"
07:39;07:45;"story is untrue and that he did not invent Flamin' Hot Cheetos. And in fact, it was a team"
07:45;07:50;"based in the Midwest at Frito-Lay had been working on Flamin' Hot Cheetos for years."
07:50;07:51;"Chemists."
07:51;07:56;"Well, that's what they say in the movie. But this LA Times guy, he interviews all these people,"
07:56;08:01;"including a woman who really claims it was kind of, she spearheaded the project."
08:01;08:06;"They'd never heard of Montanez. They don't dispute that he became an influential executive at"
08:06;08:10;"Frito-Lay, but they're basically like, no, this was a team. This is how it works. This was a"
08:10;08:18;"group that was developing this for years, testing it out. And that's where Flamin' Hot Cheetos came"
08:18;08:24;"from. So that piece came out, obviously people are going wild about it, but interestingly,"
08:24;08:30;"it barely impacted the release of this movie. And in fact, this movie was even screened at the"
08:30;08:36;"White House. But we discussed this a couple of months ago. They really rolled out the red carpet"
08:36;08:40;"for this movie at the White House. There's pictures of Joe and Jill Biden posing with director"
08:40;08:47;"Eva Longoria, members of the cast are there. They have a mariachi band on the South Lawn."
08:47;08:54;"They also projected an orange light at the White House, if I'm remembering correctly."
08:54;09:00;"Oh, just to make the White House. It should have been red light. An orangey red."
09:00;09:03;"Damn, I'm so hot, can't touch me. Just like Cheetos on your fingers, wanna suck me."
09:03;09:07;"City y'all hiking up, all this joint, this thing is hotter than me, don't push it."
09:07;09:11;"Mediocre and that ain't me hating. Y'all be the best out of bad situation. Yes,"
09:11;09:17;"I do think I'm that bitch. I'm all that, in a bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Ooh, baby, baby."
09:17;09:21;"But baby, baby. I'm a real hot girl. I'm a talk, much talk, much, I'm all that,"
09:21;09:27;"in a bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Ooh, baby, baby. But baby, baby. With a face like that,"
09:27;09:30;"in a body like this, no outlet, in a bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
09:30;09:34;"They really rolled out the red carpet. This is a big deal. Joe Biden gives a speech about"
09:34;09:39;"believing in yourself and Hispanic Americans and all this kind of stuff."
09:39;09:46;"But seemingly, Montaigne's was not there, which we saw as a bit of a slight."
09:46;09:51;"So it's been an interesting rollout for this film. As discussed, Richard Montaigne's is in the film."
09:51;09:57;"There's interviews with one of the co-writers who said, ""You know what? This movie's true enough."
09:57;10:03;"I've written other movies based on real stuff. And of course, we're gonna have some flexibility"
10:03;10:10;"as storytellers with our relationship to facts. But it's true enough, as far as I understand it."""
10:10;10:15;"And there was even a statement I saw. An unidentified person in the White House"
10:15;10:20;"responded to some press inquiry about the White House screening. And even this person"
10:20;10:24;"who worked in the White House said something like, ""You know what? It's a great story."
10:25;10:30;"And we support the message behind it."" So there's this interesting thing going on where"
10:30;10:36;"even Frito-Lay's a little bit like, ""We love Richard. He's an inspiration. But maybe he"
10:36;10:41;"didn't invent Flamin' Hot Cheetos."" And I can say after watching the film, I don't care"
10:41;10:50;"whatever he did, because it is kind of a moving story about an unlikely path to become an"
10:50;10:55;"executive about Frito-Lay. And whether he actually invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos or not,"
10:55;11:02;"it's kind of a sweet movie. And I didn't think I would feel this way, but I could kind of agree"
11:02;11:06;"with the people saying, ""You know what? It might not be exactly true, but it's a feel-good story,"
11:06;11:10;"and it's true enough."" Anyway, what did you guys think about the film?"
11:10;11:16;"Well, yeah. It makes me think of JFK or something, where there's a lot of murkiness"
11:16;11:23;"to the facts laid out, but you come away with, you know, you have a good time at the movies."
11:23;11:35;"It makes me think of our Supreme coffin. It doesn't matter if it exists. This doesn't matter"
11:35;11:41;"if it happened. The story is really good. Like you said, it's inspiring."
11:41;11:48;"It's a funny story. It's like this guy on his charisma and his hard work and his"
11:48;11:56;"tenacious approach to life, you know, gets him pretty far. But it is funny at the end of the day"
11:56;12:04;"that he ends up as if getting a job in marketing is the pinnacle of achievement for someone."
12:05;12:14;"To me, that was a little bit sad. And there was never any sort of reflection on that. It was just"
12:14;12:20;"sort of like, ""Dude, you're a marketing guy now."" And granted, he came from a really poor background."
12:20;12:27;"I guess he was maybe a second generation American. It was just kind of a funny takeaway."
12:27;12:33;"I forgot that it was the marketing. Somehow I'd forgotten the story, and I was like, ""Oh yeah,"
12:33;12:37;"Montana's is the CEO of Frito-Lay now."""
12:37;12:38;"No, he's a marketing guy."
12:38;12:39;"That's not quite that good."
12:39;12:48;"I almost was more interested in him learning the craft of the machine maintenance from Dennis"
12:48;12:55;"Haysbert, which honestly I could see being a more rewarding and literally kind of hands-on"
12:56;13:05;"trade to learn. I mean, there's all these highly technical and specific machines that are used for"
13:05;13:12;"manufacturing. These stacks have to be precisely calibrated. If one little thing is off, then the"
13:12;13:19;"whole batch is under. And Dennis Haysbert sort of was the guy that was really knew every little"
13:19;13:26;"nook and cranny, every nut and bolt in the factory. And over the years, he sort of schooled"
13:26;13:30;"Montana's in this. I don't know. I think that's a cooler gig, but-"
13:30;13:38;"I'd go in further to say I was so into that story that I found myself wanting to watch the movie"
13:38;13:44;"about Dennis Haysbert. So much so that I looked it up only to find that he didn't exist."
13:44;13:45;"He's a composite?"
13:45;13:48;"He's a composite."
13:48;13:50;"He was the character named Clarence."
13:50;13:55;"You can say he's a composite. No one can even tell you who he's even a composite of."
13:55;14:00;"So this is where I do think there's something murky. The waters aren't clear."
14:00;14:06;"Also, the thing you said about that Haysbert character being a composite,"
14:06;14:12;"really the years in that were way off from the movie. Because in that, Montanus is saying he"
14:12;14:17;"was a machinist in 1977, but in the movie, he's not even hired until like '82, '83."
14:17;14:20;"Right. And then the Reagan years take their toll."
14:20;14:24;"Yeah. Can we get even the basic timeline established a little bit?"
14:24;14:29;"I think we're all on the same page here. We don't want to see Montanus get taken down"
14:29;14:36;"by the lying news media, the gotcha journalist just trying to poke holes in his story."
14:36;14:40;"That doesn't make anybody feel good. Let the people have the parable."
14:40;14:43;"It doesn't mean he's a bad guy. It doesn't mean-"
14:43;14:45;"Facts don't care about your feelings, Ezra."
14:45;14:51;"I mean, don't you feel that there's a meta quality to the whole thing?"
14:51;14:56;"I think we all just want to know the truth because it would be interesting. Because again,"
14:56;15:02;"it's not as simple as, ""Oh, a janitor at Frito-Lay invented Flaming Hot Cheetos and became"
15:02;15:08;"the godfather of Hispanic marketing."" Turns out this guy never even worked at Frito-Lay."
15:08;15:16;"Didn't you get the feeling that maybe Montanus is a creation of the marketing department of Frito-Lay?"
15:16;15:18;"That he doesn't even exist?"
15:18;15:24;"No, that's too much of a long game, dude. That's sort of like, ""Has Bruce been a Russian"
15:24;15:27;"Asian since '87?"" There's no way-"
15:27;15:33;"No, but that they found a dude. No, no. There is a meta quality to the movie that is interesting,"
15:33;15:43;"which is that it's about creating a marketing plan around a product to speak to this emerging"
15:43;15:49;"demographic, the Mexican or Latino demographic. So, they need the story. The whole thing is how"
15:49;15:57;"we need the story. Wouldn't it be a great story if a janitor moved his way up to become this"
15:57;16:02;"marketing person that created the market? I could see being like, ""Oh, that guy in the back?"
16:02;16:06;"You're now our guy."" And then they sort of create a fiction around that."
16:06;16:09;"I mean, I love this as an idea."
16:09;16:11;"There are pictures of him working as a janitor."
16:11;16:12;"I mean, there's a chaos."
16:12;16:17;"I don't like that it takes so much agency away from our guy Montaignez, but based on what we"
16:17;16:24;"know about the ways that some people try to manipulate events, the idea that maybe Frito"
16:24;16:33;"Lay would take a janitor off the floor, dose them with acid for weeks, and kind of brainwash them"
16:33;16:39;"until they believe a story. That might actually explain why Montaignez,"
16:39;16:41;"why the facts don't totally add up."
16:41;16:42;"He's a Manchurian candidate."
16:42;16:45;"You know, it'd be great."
16:45;16:47;"Covered in orange Frito dust."
16:47;16:53;"I think somewhere between '77 and '83, I got a job at Frito. I really, honestly,"
16:53;16:54;"I can't really remember."
16:54;17:01;"He's been so traumatized that he's invented the Dennis Haysburg character in his mind."
17:01;17:06;"They cut back to the seeds with Dennis Haysburg, and it's like no one's in the room with him."
17:06;17:07;"Or the actual Dennis Haysburg."
17:07;17:09;"To be honest, the last thing I remember."
17:09;17:15;"After being horrified and like, ""There's spiders all over me!"" Then Dennis Haysburg,"
17:15;17:19;"who's like a high level CIA guy, comes in and just like, ""Richard,"
17:19;17:26;"everything's gonna be fine."" With his soothing, deep voice."
17:28;17:33;"Sometimes I feel like I just wanna go back to my old ways"
17:33;17:35;"You're telling me I'm silly, it's no fun"
17:35;17:38;"In the old days, I'm such a romantic"
17:38;17:42;"I never remember, but things really happen"
17:42;17:44;"I guess you're attractive or something"
17:44;17:49;"Live in the moment, that's what they tell me"
17:49;17:52;"But whatever happened, to when you would hold me"
17:52;17:54;"And hold me, and hold me"
17:54;17:57;"Girlfriend, a girl that's a friend"
17:57;18:01;"It's easy just to pretend that we don't have something real"
18:01;18:03;"It's just how we feel"
18:03;18:04;"Here's another thought that I have."
18:04;18:09;"Going from janitor to executive at Frito-Lay is highly unusual."
18:09;18:16;"And I'd imagine it probably involved a lot of very boring stuff that wouldn't look good on film."
18:16;18:23;"Whereas a guy experimenting with like, different kinds of chilis at home with his kids."
18:23;18:25;"You know, like we all remember the montage."
18:25;18:26;"It's cute."
18:26;18:29;"There's like a running joke in it where he, where one of his sons"
18:29;18:35;"eats something spicy, like spicy elote, and says, ""Ahh, it's hot!"""
18:35;18:37;"And then he goes, ""Oh, don't eat it then!"""
18:37;18:38;"He goes, ""No, it's good hot."""
18:38;18:40;"And it's like, it's kind of a cute thing."
18:40;18:43;"They're trying all these different chili peppers and the son goes, ""Ahh, it's hot!"""
18:43;18:44;"And they go, ""Good hot or bad hot?"""
18:44;18:45;"""Bad hot!"""
18:45;18:47;"And then like, finally, he goes, ""Good hot!"""
18:47;18:49;"And they're like, ""We cracked it."""
18:49;18:50;"It's a really cute montage."
18:50;18:52;"Brilliantly directed."
18:52;18:54;"Yeah, I would say, can I just say real fast?"
18:54;18:59;"Visually, that part of the movie was like, I felt like she was really looking at like,"
18:59;19:00;"Goodfellas."
19:00;19:06;"Because there was like, smash edits of like, Montanhas coming in the door with like, a"
19:06;19:07;"handful of chilis."
19:07;19:11;"They would cut him coming in the door with a different t-shirt on, a different day, different"
19:11;19:12;"chilis."
19:12;19:16;"And it really felt like the ending of like, the last 20 minutes of Goodfellas."
19:16;19:21;"When Leota and Karen are just like, at the table with like, the Coke and they're just"
19:21;19:23;"like, packaging the Coke and like, ""Janice!"
19:23;19:24;"Like, put that on!"""
19:24;19:27;"Just like, it was like, this frantic sort of like, creative energy."
19:27;19:28;"It totally makes sense."
19:28;19:29;"Yeah."
19:29;19:31;"This has so much of that ""In My Neighborhood"" energy."
19:31;19:32;"Yeah."
19:32;19:39;"Because he used to kind of be in the streets, they imply maybe doing a bit of drug dealing"
19:39;19:39;"or something."
19:39;19:45;"They also enjoy that interplay of him getting his kind of gangster friends and being like,"
19:45;19:49;"I don't know if they quite say this, but basically it's like, ""We used to move drugs,"
19:49;19:51;"now we're moving Cheetos."
19:51;19:52;"Come on!"""
19:52;19:55;"You know, like, so they, it would totally make sense that she would have gone back to"
19:55;19:58;"reference a few classic gangster movies."
19:58;20:05;"But I guess all I'm saying is that that concept of a guy, I'm willing to accept that what"
20:05;20:11;"we see on screen, a guy in his kitchen experimenting to get the dust right and testing it on his"
20:11;20:19;"kid is a cinematic way of condensing what in reality might've been five years of slowly"
20:19;20:24;"working his way up the corporate ladder and having kind of boring conversations along"
20:24;20:27;"the lines of like, ""Well, yeah, all right, you guys develop Flamin' Hot Cheetos, but"
20:27;20:30;"I don't know if you really know how to connect with the Hispanic market."
20:30;20:32;"You got a bunch of old white guys marketing it."
20:32;20:33;"Can we talk about it?"""
20:33;20:37;"You know, I actually had an interesting conversation with my son the other day and he said that"
20:37;20:40;"at the store that he, all this stuff that'd be too boring."
20:40;20:44;"So instead, it can't be just him making endless spreadsheets."
20:44;20:46;"It has to be, he invented it."
20:46;20:46;"Yeah."
20:46;20:47;"It's a better story."
20:47;20:55;"But okay, so then we accept that for the film, but did he really just watch, get inspired"
20:55;20:59;"by the CEO of Frito-Lay and just like make a cold call?"
20:59;21:02;"So there was on social media, a woman-"
21:02;21:03;"A woman who took the call."
21:03;21:04;"Yeah, Patti Roof."
21:04;21:06;"The secretary came to his defense."
21:06;21:09;"Yeah, let me just read this real fast."
21:09;21:10;"Please let me introduce myself."
21:10;21:17;"My name is Patti Roof and I was Roger Enricos, aka Tony Shalhoub's executive"
21:17;21:19;"assistant for over 20 years."
21:19;21:24;"Since everyone is so interested in debunking Richard Montanus's history with Frito-Lay,"
21:24;21:28;"I'd like to set the record straight as it did with the LA Times reporter who totally"
21:28;21:33;"had his own agenda and totally disregarded all that we talked about for his article."
21:33;21:35;"Have any of you seen the movie?"
21:35;21:41;"If so, you'd see that Richard called Roger because he found the number in the company"
21:41;21:44;"directory and the binder and the break room."
21:44;21:45;"Which did."
21:45;21:49;"Honestly, stretch credulity a little bit for me."
21:49;21:50;"But anyway, what did she say?"
21:50;21:51;"She says, ""Blah, blah, blah."
21:51;21:56;"After much angst to pitch his idea for a new product for Cheetos, I'm the person that took"
21:56;21:57;"his call."
21:57;22:03;"I listened to his pitch, which was confident yet respectful, full of passion yet humble"
22:03;22:04;"and thoroughly thought out."
22:04;22:09;"Something about him struck a chord with me and I'm the one who put the call through to"
22:09;22:11;"Roger,"" all in caps."
22:11;22:14;"""This is 100% fact, not fiction."
22:14;22:19;"As you may know, Roger was a marketing genius and he knew a good idea when he heard one."
22:19;22:23;"He, in fact, did ask me to set up a meeting with Richard the next time he did a plant"
22:23;22:26;"tour in California and the rest is history."""
22:26;22:27;"That's her testimony."
22:27;22:29;"So maybe that part is true."
22:29;22:30;"That answers the question."
22:30;22:33;"How did a janitor get linked up with the CEO?"
22:33;22:34;"He picked up the phone."
22:34;22:35;"He found the phone number."
22:35;22:40;"I don't find it too hard to believe that you could track down the CEO's phone number."
22:40;22:41;"Yeah."
22:41;22:46;"Honestly, having worked in a lot of big corporations over the years, I feel like even if you wanted"
22:46;22:52;"to get in touch with like a Ted Sarandos or a Tim Apple, their number, these things are"
22:52;22:53;"not particularly complicated."
22:53;22:59;"If I wanted to put a call in to Tim Apple to complain about a hostile work environment"
22:59;23:02;"on Time Crisis, I couldn't do that."
23:02;23:04;"I don't think I would be able to."
23:04;23:05;"You absolutely could."
23:05;23:11;"And you may find an executive assistant who is sympathetic with your complaint and you"
23:11;23:12;"say, ""You know what?"
23:12;23:13;"Let me think about this."
23:13;23:14;"Jake, I'm going to put you through."""
23:14;23:15;"Even funnier."
23:15;23:16;"But most likely you won't."
23:16;23:17;"Most likely you won't."
23:17;23:18;"But you will ask."
23:18;23:18;"Well, also-"
23:18;23:22;"It would not take a lot of work for you to get to his office."
23:22;23:26;"No matter what, you got to get through the secretary and that's where Patty Roof becomes"
23:26;23:27;"a very important part of the story."
23:27;23:34;"If she hadn't had a good heart and her own good instincts about marketing, maybe he never"
23:34;23:34;"would have gotten through."
23:34;23:35;"Right."
23:35;23:38;"Just because you get the number does not mean you're talking to the big boss."
23:38;23:41;"And even then, you might be right, Nick, that you could call Tim Apple."
23:41;23:47;"But especially back then, I feel like at somewhere in the plant, who knows?"
23:47;23:49;"Maybe it wasn't just in the break room."
23:49;23:54;"Maybe in reality he had to go to the plant manager and really charm him and say, ""I"
23:54;23:58;"know this sounds crazy, but I really want to try to call Roger Enrico."""
23:58;24:01;"And the plant manager is like, ""Well, why?"""
24:01;24:04;"And he's just like, ""I have this marketing idea."""
24:04;24:05;"And maybe the plant manager is like, ""You know what?"
24:05;24:07;"You've been a great employee for years."
24:07;24:08;"Here's the number."
24:08;24:10;"If you can get through the secretary, good for you."""
24:10;24:12;"It could be as simple as that."
24:12;24:17;"Well, not if this plant manager was anything like Matt Walsh as depicted in the film."
24:17;24:19;"Shout out to Matt Walsh."
24:19;24:26;"Maybe my favorite line in the movie was, ""Montanhas, this extruder is covered in cheese dust."""
24:26;24:33;"I wanted more technical stuff in that movie."
24:33;24:35;"I liked that they used the term extruder a lot."
24:35;24:36;"I don't know what an extruder is."
24:36;24:38;"- That was cool."
24:38;24:44;"Wait, and also, Jake, you pointed out one of the most legendary lines where when Montanhas"
24:44;24:48;"calls the CEO and he basically is talking about the slurry."
24:48;24:49;"- Yeah, the chili slurry."
24:49;24:50;"- The cheese slurry."
24:50;24:55;"And he's like, ""Mr. Enrico, I created my own flaming hot chili slurry."""
24:55;24:58;"And he goes, and Tony Shalhoub's like, ""Whoa, whoa, whoa."
24:58;25:01;"You created your own chili slurry?"""
25:01;25:02;"""That's right, sir."""
25:02;25:05;"Just the fact they repeat slurry twice in slurry."
25:05;25:06;"- Classic moment."
25:06;25:13;"- At least in this show, when I hear slurry, I think of disgusting animal byproducts that"
25:13;25:17;"have just been turned into this viscous liquid."
25:17;25:21;"But chili slurry."
25:21;25:25;"- My only note is that they should have made slurry a runner throughout."
25:25;25:30;"If Matt Walsh was like, ""Montanhas, quit working on that slurry."
25:30;25:32;"Get your butt back on the floor."""
25:33;25:35;"- ""This extruder's covered in cheese dust."""
25:35;25:44;"- For anybody who doesn't know, Matt Walsh was from, I always think of him from the original"
25:44;25:50;"Upright Citizens Brigade, a legendary crew where Amy Poehler also got her starred and"
25:50;25:52;"he was on Veep."
25:52;25:52;"- Yeah."
25:52;25:56;"- Truly one of the great character actors of his generation."
25:56;25:57;"He really brought some flavor to the film."
25:57;26:01;"- I do feel like Matt Walsh was in like a Mike Judge movie."
26:01;26:04;"- He was in a slightly different movie than the other people."

27:08;27:10;"'Cause I was, I watched this, actually, you know,"
27:10;27:14;"when this first came out, I hit play immediately."
27:14;27:16;"Like I was counting down the seconds"
27:16;27:17;"until it went live on Hulu."
27:17;27:19;"And then I texted you guys"
27:19;27:20;"and there was a bit of like swirl"
27:20;27:21;"because it was like, wait,"
27:21;27:22;"aren't we all watching this together?"
27:22;27:25;"I stopped, I watched it again later, then I revisited."
27:25;27:27;"So I watched it a while ago and then I brought it back."
27:27;27:30;"I was revisiting some scenes."
27:30;27:33;"And there's a moment early on where little Richard,"
27:33;27:36;"child Richard Montanez is getting bullied"
27:36;27:40;"by his racist, the kids at his school."
27:40;27:41;"- Oh yeah."
27:41;27:42;"- And he wants the bologna sandwich."
27:42;27:44;"And his mother is like,"
27:44;27:46;"you're not getting a bologna sandwich."
27:46;27:47;"Here's an extra burrito."
27:47;27:48;"- She's packing him burritos."
27:48;27:48;"- Right."
27:48;27:51;"- He's getting made fun of by racist kids."
27:51;27:52;"Ew, what are you eating?"
27:52;27:53;"Ma, and then at home,"
27:53;27:55;"mom, can I please just get a bologna sandwich?"
27:55;27:56;"- Right, right."
27:56;27:58;"And then she gives him an extra one"
27:58;28:00;"to introduce burritos to the racists."
28:00;28:05;"And for me, there was a little bit of a heightened quality"
28:05;28:09;"to he goes from them making fun of the burritos"
28:09;28:13;"to then converting the entire school to loving burritos"
28:13;28:17;"and becoming this sort of like burrito hustler."
28:17;28:18;"- Yeah, yeah."
28:18;28:21;"- It just felt like a little bit of an unrealistic jump"
28:21;28:24;"from we're gonna make fun of what you're eating"
28:24;28:27;"to all of a sudden one bite and we're all,"
28:27;28:29;"I mean, not to say that burritos are amazing."
28:29;28:29;"- This is pretty good."
28:29;28:30;"- Right, yeah."
28:30;28:31;"It just."
28:31;28:33;"- I mean, I do feel like the movie,"
28:33;28:36;"like he was raised in Southern California."
28:36;28:37;"I don't think that,"
28:37;28:40;"I don't get the sense that Mexican food was as ubiquitous"
28:40;28:42;"in like white communities in the '60s,"
28:42;28:43;"but it was still around."
28:43;28:45;"I mean, Taco Bell started in 1962."
28:45;28:46;"- It was like starting-"
28:46;28:48;"- Picturing a racist white kid"
28:49;28:51;"being mean about a burrito in the late '60s."
28:51;28:53;"That's the easy part to imagine."
28:53;28:55;"But as Seinfeld says,"
28:55;28:57;"just a bunch of racist white kids."
28:57;28:59;"- Just turning on a dime."
28:59;29:01;"- Also maybe think of the Fablemans too."
29:01;29:04;"Just another like trip down memory lane."
29:04;29:09;"But the idea that a kid would say that he would,"
29:09;29:11;"""Ew, look at what that Mexican kid's eating."""
29:11;29:14;"And then he goes, ""Mm, it's actually really good."
29:14;29:15;"""Wanna try a bite?"""
29:15;29:16;"The kid takes a bite."
29:16;29:18;"He's not lying."
29:18;29:20;"- These things are good."
29:20;29:21;"But again, it's parable."
29:21;29:24;"That scene, it's condensed,"
29:24;29:28;"but it does represent the gringos' love affair"
29:28;29:29;"with Mexican cuisine."
29:29;29:33;"So even if in that moment,"
29:33;29:38;"the writers and Eva Longoria chose to make it one bite"
29:38;29:40;"and the whole school's in love with burritos,"
29:40;29:43;"in reality, it was a painful couple of decades."
29:43;29:47;"But what they are trying to say is that a kid,"
29:47;29:51;"a racist 11-year-old in the late '60s,"
29:51;29:56;"very easily 10, 15, 20, 30 years later,"
29:56;29:58;"100% is chomping on a burrito."
29:58;30:00;"- If I remember correctly,"
30:00;30:05;"maybe it is to heighten the believability of this moment"
30:05;30:07;"you guys find too fantastical."
30:07;30:09;"The kid, he goes, ""It's gonna be a dollar."""
30:09;30:10;"And the kid is pissed."
30:10;30:12;"It's like, he's like, ""I might love this burrito."
30:12;30:14;"""I don't wanna give you the money."""
30:14;30:15;"It's a very sad moment."
30:15;30:17;"Do you know what I'm talking about?"
30:17;30:18;"Where it's like, he's not like,"
30:18;30:20;"""Ooh, I turned on a dime and I love you and your culture."""
30:20;30:22;"He's like, ""But I really do need this burrito."""
30:22;30:26;"And he very tragically just slams the money down"
30:26;30:27;"and the kid walks away."
30:27;30:29;"- You know what they could have done"
30:29;30:31;"to make it a little bit more realistic?"
30:31;30:32;"It would have been a very different film,"
30:32;30:35;"but they could have gone link letter boyhood with it,"
30:35;30:40;"shot it over the course of multiple decades,"
30:40;30:45;"watches Montaigne slowly convinces the school"
30:45;30:47;"that burritos are good."
30:47;30:49;"The spreadsheet stuff we were talking about earlier,"
30:49;30:52;"we could have seen him age in real time."
30:52;30:55;"- Just a real kind of slow burn, kind of more art movie."
30:55;30:58;"- Yeah, longer term thinking."
30:58;30:59;"I guess link letter already did it."
30:59;31:01;"So you don't wanna seem, especially first film,"
31:01;31:04;"you don't wanna seem like you're doing something derivative,"
31:04;31:07;"but the payoff might've been worth it."
31:07;31:10;"- I mean, I love the idea of a very slow burn"
31:10;31:12;"kind of corporate intrigue,"
31:12;31:16;"kind of the development of a new marketing strategy"
31:16;31:18;"explored over 12 years."
31:18;31:20;"I love that as an idea."
31:20;31:21;"I think that's a tough sell."
31:21;31:23;"- Well, if you wanna go from boyhood"
31:23;31:25;"until executive status,"
31:25;31:27;"I think we're talking about like 30 years."
31:27;31:30;"So maybe we have to start working on this right now"
31:30;31:36;"because if we release this movie in the mid 2050s,"
31:36;31:37;"by then people will probably be ready"
31:37;31:39;"for another ""Flamin' Hot"" movie."
31:39;31:42;"I also think we always talk about like,"
31:42;31:45;"starting the TC production company."
31:45;31:48;"There really should be a documentary about all of this."
31:48;31:50;"If we can get access to Montaigne"
31:50;31:53;"and the LA Times reporter and Patty Roof,"
31:53;31:56;"something about also the secretary's name being Patty Roof."
31:56;31:59;"For me, it just takes me instantly to Patty Valentine"
31:59;32:03;"from ""Hurricane"", the Bob Dylan ""Hurricane"" song,"
32:03;32:04;"who I guess was also a real figure"
32:04;32:06;"in the story of the hurricane."
32:06;32:08;"And Patty Valentine was a key witness"
32:08;32:11;"who put the wrong guy away, the hurricane."
32:11;32:14;"I'm just picturing like a 12 verse Bob Dylan song"
32:14;32:16;"about the real story of ""Flamin' Hot Cheetos"""
32:16;32:19;"with like a whole one verse about Patty Roof."
32:19;32:21;"- Bob Dylan's on the tour bus watching ""Flamin' Hot"""
32:21;32:23;"and he's just strumming the guitar"
32:23;32:25;"and he starts writing this, yeah,"
32:25;32:29;"like a 12 minute song about the story of Richard Montaigne."
32:29;32:31;"- And Patty Roof picked up the phone."

33:10;33:12;"there's one thing at the end that I,"
33:12;33:13;"you know, I texted the group"
33:13;33:15;"and I know what they're referring to,"
33:15;33:18;"but it did feel pretty funny given, you know,"

34:04;34:07;"Like you can't be splashing that hard."""
34:07;34:08;"Just like at a restaurant,"
34:08;34:11;"like giving out like 800 bucks in tips in a night."
34:11;34:14;"What do you think a marketing guy at Frito-Lay"
34:14;34:17;"is pulling down in the 90s?"
34:17;34:21;"- I really have no idea."
34:21;34:22;"- That's a good salary,"
34:22;34:26;"but that's not like a millionaire gangster salary."
34:26;34:29;"- A marketing executive at Frito-Lay"
34:29;34:33;"is making between 236,000 and $400,000 a year."
34:33;34:34;"- Okay."
34:34;34:38;"- Which is pretty huge if you were a janitor the year before"
34:38;34:41;"who might've been making what, a fifth of that."
34:41;34:44;"But yeah, I know what you mean."
34:44;34:45;"It's not like you're the CEO."
34:45;34:48;"You're not flying on the private plane."
34:48;34:49;"Or are you?"
34:49;34:49;"I don't know."
34:49;34:52;"And also, one of the mysterious things about it"
34:52;34:54;"is that he's often referred to"
34:54;34:57;"as the godfather of Hispanic marketing."
34:57;35:00;"Clearly he did something unique"
35:00;35:03;"and definitely is part of the Flamin' Hot story,"
35:03;35:04;"even if he didn't invent them."
35:04;35:07;"But it's a little bit funny at the end"
35:07;35:08;"when they kind of show like,"
35:08;35:12;"you know, Richard's marketing genius launched an empire."
35:12;35:13;"And what do they flash on screen?"
35:13;35:17;"Flamin' Hot popcorn, Flamin' Hot Fritos,"
35:17;35:19;"and like two other Flamin' Hot things."
35:19;35:22;"And I'm not trying to be a hater,"
35:22;35:24;"but I'm just like, there's gotta be more than that."
35:24;35:25;"- Oh wait."
35:25;35:26;"- There's gotta be more than just like--"
35:26;35:27;"- Right."
35:27;35:29;"- 'Cause you know at the end, it's basically--"
35:29;35:30;"And I--"
35:30;35:31;"(laughs)"
35:31;35:34;"It says, Tony Shalhoub says to him, he goes,"
35:34;35:36;"""I wanna make you the marketing executive"
35:36;35:37;"""'cause I wanna hear all your ideas."""
35:37;35:39;"And it's just so funny."
35:39;35:42;"It's like, next time he comes in and he's like,"
35:42;35:44;"""All right, so Montaners, what do you got?"""
35:44;35:45;"Blow my mind."
35:45;35:49;"He's like, sitting down, Flamin' Hot popcorn,"
35:49;35:51;"Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
35:51;35:52;"We'll make Flamin' Hot."
35:52;35:54;"It's like, it's sort of, okay, okay."
35:54;35:55;"What else you got?"
35:55;35:57;"(laughs)"
35:57;35:58;"Don't say Flamin' Hot again."
35:58;35:59;"- That's kind of it."
35:59;36:01;"Montaners, you're fired."
36:01;36:03;"Thanks for the ideas."
36:03;36:08;"Also, in this disgusting era that we live in,"
36:08;36:10;"where every day a new monstrosity comes out,"
36:10;36:13;"it almost does feel like AI generated"
36:13;36:14;"or algorithmically generated,"
36:14;36:17;"where it's like, Snickers coffee creamer,"
36:17;36:22;"you know, Doritos with Raisinets in them."
36:22;36:23;"Just every dumb thing you can think of,"
36:23;36:25;"it basically exists."
36:25;36:27;"It's almost they're horrifying on purpose."
36:27;36:31;"So just like, clearly these ideas are cheap."
36:31;36:32;"They're a dime a dozen."
36:32;36:34;"So I would also like to believe"
36:34;36:37;"if Richard Montaners is a marketing genius,"
36:37;36:39;"which one way or another, I think he is."
36:39;36:42;"This is the stuff that we would be interested in."
36:42;36:44;"Maybe not the average person just watching the movie."
36:44;36:45;"They just want to have a good time."
36:45;36:50;"But maybe his true marketing genius was not merely in saying,"
36:50;36:52;"""Oh, why don't we do Flamin' Hot popcorn?"""
36:52;36:55;"Maybe he was actually in the weeds doing marketing."
36:55;36:57;"And I'd want to know what that is,"
36:57;37:01;"which is like, how did he kind of reach more people?"
37:01;37:03;"How did he reach more of the Hispanic market?"
37:03;37:05;"How did he help it cross over"
37:05;37:08;"to just becoming a beloved American thing?"
37:08;37:09;"Like, what was he doing?"
37:09;37:12;"Was he throwing, you know, what do marketing people do?"
37:12;37:16;"Throw events, have something to do with the print ads,"
37:16;37:18;"have something to do with TV ads."
37:18;37:21;"Like, that's, we don't have any real answers to that question."
37:21;37:25;"Like, in the next, after the product launched in the next 20 years,"
37:25;37:27;"what was his day-to-day like?"
37:27;37:28;"What was he approving?"
37:28;37:29;"What was he cooking up?"
37:29;37:31;"- Yeah, like, what was year four of Flamin' Hot"
37:31;37:32;"being on the market looking like?"
37:32;37:36;"'Cause like, they juiced the sales in SoCal,"
37:36;37:40;"well, very locally in Rancho Cucamonga"
37:40;37:43;"with their guerrilla marketing campaign"
37:43;37:45;"of just going up to people in the park"
37:45;37:48;"and giving them Flamin' Hot."
37:48;37:50;"And that seemed to like, bump the sales."
37:51;37:55;"But yeah, it's like, okay, that gave them enough juice"
37:55;37:58;"to like, keep the product being made"
37:58;38:02;"and manufactured and distributed."
38:02;38:05;"But yeah, like, what, exactly, year three,"
38:05;38:07;"how are you hitting that like, Midwest market?"
38:07;38:08;"- That's the real question."
38:08;38:11;"And again, maybe that's where his true genius lies"
38:11;38:14;"because who cares if somebody else invented it?"
38:14;38:18;"And it's totally possible that the most charitable answer"
38:18;38:20;"to all of this, and they even say this in the movie,"
38:20;38:21;"there's a part where he says,"
38:21;38:23;"they have to have this little aside where he goes,"
38:23;38:25;"and there was a team in the Midwest cooking up"
38:25;38:28;"their own version of a spicy Cheeto,"
38:28;38:30;"but they were using chemicals."
38:30;38:32;"And then they cut to some people in lab coats"
38:32;38:36;"with some red stuff and beakers and test tubes,"
38:36;38:41;"you know, to show like, ew, sterile, disgusting, no soul."
38:41;38:42;"And then it shows him in the kitchen"
38:42;38:44;"with the whole family chopping up chilies."
38:44;38:46;"Like he was doing the more authentic thing."
38:46;38:48;"Again, that could just be a parable."
38:48;38:51;"Maybe if all they're trying to say is these people"
38:51;38:53;"created the product, but they didn't know what to do with it."
38:53;38:56;"Whereas for me, as I think they say in the movie,"
38:56;38:57;"these flavors are in my blood."
38:57;39:01;"He's just trying to say, I understood this product better."
39:01;39:04;"So is it possible that he called up Roger Enrico,"
39:04;39:06;"made a pitch about a flaming hot Cheeto."
39:06;39:07;"Roger Enrico said, I wanna meet you next time"
39:07;39:09;"in Rancho Cucamonga."
39:09;39:11;"He meets in Rancho Cucamonga, says, here's the thing,"
39:11;39:13;"Montanhas, we've been working on this product"
39:13;39:14;"for a few years."
39:14;39:17;"We have a team in the Midwest and I think they cracked it."
39:17;39:19;"You know, you're not the first guy who pitched me"
39:19;39:21;"a spicy version of Cheetos."
39:21;39:23;"I get ideas like that every day."
39:23;39:25;"You know, we work in the snack industry."
39:25;39:27;"Either you got your products,"
39:27;39:31;"either you're gonna make them sweet or spicy or low fat."
39:31;39:33;"You know, you don't have to be a rocket scientist"
39:33;39:35;"to like come up with those ideas."
39:35;39:36;"But I liked something about your pitch."
39:36;39:38;"I do think you have unique insight."
39:38;39:40;"And actually the fools who invented this thing"
39:40;39:43;"in the Midwest, they don't know what to do with it."
39:43;39:46;"So I'm gonna bring these two branches of my empire together"
39:46;39:48;"and I want you to work that."
39:48;39:50;"And then maybe he's like, okay."
39:50;39:53;"Yeah, I mean, that's very, very believable."
39:53;39:54;"It's a mysterious story."
39:54;39:57;"And have we been able to find any insight"
39:57;40:00;"into what Montanhas is thinking"
40:00;40:02;"and what his relationship is with this movie?"
40:02;40:05;"I don't know, Seinfeld, have you looked at his socials recently?"
40:05;40:06;"I looked recently."
40:06;40:07;"There wasn't much going on."
40:07;40:09;"Yeah, I had the same."
40:09;40:13;"It's giving silenced, you know, it's giving muzzled."
40:13;40:17;"I get the sense that they didn't want him."
40:17;40:19;"He's a big personality."
40:19;40:21;"And I think probably from a marketing standpoint,"
40:21;40:24;"they didn't want Montanhas to become the voice,"
40:24;40:27;"the mouth box of the entire campaign,"
40:27;40:29;"particularly as Oscar season approaches."
40:29;40:34;"So do you think they like paid him to stay quiet?"
40:34;40:35;"You know, what would they call?"
40:35;40:38;"Yeah, because like, what if he goes on like,"
40:38;40:40;"yeah, like a drive time, like radio show"
40:40;40:43;"and someone brings up the LA Times article,"
40:43;40:44;"then he like wilds out."
40:44;40:45;"Yeah."
40:45;40:47;"That guy's full of crap."
40:47;40:50;"Like, I'm the guy that, you know, everything in the movie is true."
40:50;40:54;"Like, I think he probably made a good chunk,"
40:54;40:57;"chunk of change from the film and the option,"
40:57;40:59;"the rights to the story."
40:59;41:01;"I think probably there was a serious conversation"
41:01;41:02;"where they were like, look,"
41:02;41:04;"you're a little toxic right now, Richard."
41:04;41:06;"That means no Biden."
41:06;41:07;"Okay, that means no Kimmel."
41:07;41:10;"Okay, no AM radio."
41:11;41:13;"You're going to take a little bit of a backseat"
41:13;41:14;"and Richard probably said, you know what?"
41:14;41:15;"Let's have the, I love the film."
41:15;41:18;"Let's have it speak for me."
41:18;41:21;"But I think probably there was a little bit of a come to Jesus."
41:21;41:24;"I bet he was pretty bummed out by that."
41:24;41:26;"I mean, really weird that he wasn't at the White House event"
41:26;41:29;"because it's not like Biden's going to grill him"
41:29;41:31;"on like the veracity of the story."
41:31;41:34;"Biden would just be there with a photo op."
41:34;41:34;"I mean."
41:34;41:40;"Montanhas, you didn't really invent Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
41:40;41:41;"Come on, come on, Jack."
41:41;41:44;"But it's not like he's just a dude."
41:44;41:48;"Wait, is this an Ezra first Biden impression on the show?"
41:48;41:51;"I feel like we haven't heard an Ezra Biden."
41:51;41:51;"It's good."
41:51;41:52;"It's good."
41:52;41:55;"Come clean, Montanhas."
41:55;41:58;"This is eyes closed."
41:58;41:59;"That kind of secret service,"
41:59;42:03;"like just corrals Montanhas over to an isolated area."
42:03;42:07;"Come on, Richie."
42:08;42:10;"Anyway, how many thumbs up are we giving it?"
42:10;42:12;"Are we giving this movie eight thumbs up?"
42:12;42:14;"Seinfeld's two."
42:14;42:17;"Yeah, I mean, you know, for the sake of the Slack community"
42:17;42:21;"and positive fellow feeling, I'll give it two thumbs up."
42:21;42:26;"I think that honestly, I was going to give it one."
42:26;42:26;"OK."
42:26;42:30;"And it really did generate a lot of conversation."
42:30;42:31;"Do you know what I mean?"
42:31;42:31;"I thought about it."
42:31;42:33;"That's unusual."
42:33;42:34;"It totally is."
42:34;42:38;"I'm still thinking about it, still talking about it."
42:38;42:41;"In many ways, it's similar to Oppenheimer, which I did just see,"
42:41;42:45;"which also I wouldn't necessarily call a perfect film."
42:45;42:51;"You could poke some holes at elements of it made by another great director."
42:51;42:56;"But at the end of the day, it's a great conversation piece talking about"
42:56;43:00;"a complicated, charismatic man who changed history through an invention."
43:00;43:02;"Those movies have more in common than you might think."
43:02;43:06;"I'll also say, like, because people loved Air."
43:07;43:10;"You know, Air got, I felt like there was a real warmth around the film Air."
43:10;43:13;"Air's not that much better than Flamin' Hot."
43:13;43:14;"Not that much better."
43:14;43:19;"No, it's just, it's just got like kind of more charismatic actors or, you know,"
43:19;43:20;"as big movie stars."
43:20;43:22;"It's got bigger movie stars."
43:22;43:23;"Yeah."
43:23;43:25;"But it's the exact same energy of kind of just like"
43:25;43:31;"a not so distant period piece about a beloved product."
43:31;43:35;"We think in best supporting for Shalhoub, what are the odds?"
43:35;43:39;"I would actually say that Jesse Garcia, the lead, he was good."
43:39;43:40;"Yeah, he was."
43:40;43:42;"Cillian Murphy versus Garcia."
43:42;43:50;"I'm saying best supporting for Shalhoub, best actor for Jesse Garcia,"
43:50;43:52;"and best director for Eva Longoria."
43:52;43:53;"Why not?"
43:53;43:54;"Don't sleep on the cinematography."
43:54;43:58;"I thought we were sure you were going to say, don't sleep on Matt Walsh."
43:58;44:04;"Golden Globes talk from Matt Walsh."
44:05;44:09;"[Laughter]"
44:09;44:18;"We've been through some things together With trunks of memories still to come"
44:18;44:31;"We found things to do in stormy weather Long may you run"
44:34;44:40;"Long may you run Long may you run"
44:40;44:45;"Although these changes have come"
44:45;44:57;"With your chrome heart shining in the sun Long may you run"
45:00;45:05;"Speaking of controversies about who invented a product,"
45:05;45:13;"we got a great email from a guy named Davin about Todd Field's role in Big League Chew."
45:13;45:16;"Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
45:16;45:18;"Jake, you're great at reading emails."
45:18;45:20;"You want to walk us through this one?"
45:20;45:23;"Yeah, I mean, this is great to circle back to Big League Chew because that was another"
45:23;45:28;"product with a contentious history that TC was early on the beat with."
45:28;45:29;"That was all you."
45:30;45:32;"Yeah, no, I mean, I, you know, I was just,"
45:32;45:36;"I had seen Tar, I was cruising the Todd Field wiki and I was like, what's this?"
45:36;45:43;"Hey, TC, my name is Davin and I'm a long time head based in Brooklyn, New York."
45:43;45:45;"I'll skip straight to the point."
45:45;45:50;"One of my favorite crew conversations comes from episode 185, Big League Bayo."
45:50;45:55;"I'm a massive fan of director Todd Field and I was surprised to hear he had a hand in creating"
45:55;45:57;"the American chewing gum, Big League Chew."
45:57;45:59;"Okay, I thought about it at least once a week."
46:00;46:02;"This Sunday morning, I was rolling through, shout out,"
46:02;46:10;"Moe's Doughs, a donut shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, as I ordered a croissant, egg and cheese"
46:10;46:16;"and an iced coffee, good order, actor Patrick Wilson entered carrying a large watermelon."
46:16;46:23;"I immediately thought about time crisis as Wilson starred in Todd Field's second feature,"
46:23;46:25;"Little Children."
46:25;46:27;"Wait, hold on."
46:27;46:30;"Just so we're painting a picture for the listeners who might not,"
46:30;46:35;"if they haven't seen Little Children, what are some other iconic Patrick Wilson roles"
46:35;46:37;"so people can picture his face?"
46:37;46:47;"Well, he's in the movies about the haunted house with Vera Farmiga, The Conjuring."
46:47;46:48;"Okay."
46:48;46:54;"And then he's also in a very famous episode of Girls where I think he has like a brief"
46:54;46:56;"tryst with Lena Dunham."
46:57;46:58;"Sounds familiar."
46:58;46:58;"Is that true?"
46:58;46:59;"He's on some other TV stuff."
46:59;47:03;"Was he in, has he ever been a cop?"
47:03;47:04;"I don't know."
47:04;47:09;"I'm not like at the ready with the Patrick Wilson IMDB, but-"
47:09;47:11;"But he's kind of like a good looking actor."
47:11;47:14;"Very, very good looking guy."
47:14;47:15;"Yeah."
47:15;47:21;"And he, in Little Children, he plays like the stay at home dad who's at the park with his kid"
47:21;47:25;"and then there's all the moms at the park who are like drooling over him."
47:25;47:26;"Okay."
47:26;47:26;"All right."
47:26;47:28;"So picture this good looking guy-"
47:28;47:29;"Little Children is a great movie."
47:29;47:30;"I mean, Todd Fields, three for three."
47:30;47:31;"Okay."
47:31;47:34;"Carrying a large watermelon into a donut shop."
47:34;47:35;"Yes."
47:35;47:39;"And so Davin's there, he sees Patrick."
47:39;47:42;"I politely asked Wilson if I could ask him a question and he agreed."
47:42;47:48;"As this is ethical celebrity encounter began, sorry, as this ethical celebrity encounter"
47:48;47:53;"began, I asked him if he was familiar with the big league chew story and if Fields had"
47:53;47:54;"ever discussed his involvement."
47:55;47:56;"He had a lot to say."
47:56;47:57;"Yes."
47:57;48:02;"Not only was Field involved in the formulation of the first batch of gum in his family kitchen,"
48:02;48:08;"no less, but as of 2006, he was palpably dismayed that he received no credit or"
48:08;48:11;"remuneration for his role in its genesis."
48:11;48:17;"As Field put it, he was excluded from any business dealings due to his age, 15."
48:17;48:22;"Additionally, Wilson offered that he enjoyed the film Tar and recommended that the Apple"
48:22;48:24;"Crisp donut at this place."
48:24;48:28;"I thanked Wilson for confirming my mid-tier obsession and wished him well."
48:28;48:30;"My takeaway, I can't stop."
48:30;48:33;"You can't stop a creative and motivated individual."
48:33;48:37;"Fields collaborators may have absconded with the bread, but he's had the last laugh with"
48:37;48:39;"his successful film career."
48:39;48:41;"I hope you enjoyed my story."
48:41;48:42;"Have a great summer."
48:42;48:46;"Best wishes to my favorite internet radio show, Davin, in Brooklyn."
48:46;48:47;"Great email."
48:47;48:52;"I mean, yeah, usually if Patrick Wilson's getting stopped on the street, it's probably"
48:52;48:54;"like, oh, hey, I love the conjuring so much."
48:54;48:56;"Like those are some of my favorite horror movies."
48:56;48:57;"You know, I love you."
48:57;48:57;"Yeah."
48:57;48:59;"We're just as an actor."
48:59;49:02;"And he's one of these guys, if you look up a picture, you've seen him in something."
49:02;49:04;"So you probably also get a lot of people being like, wait a second."
49:04;49:06;"Wait a second."
49:06;49:09;"Do we go to college together?"
49:09;49:10;"I think I know you."
49:10;49:15;"And he's like, yeah, I was, uh, I was on an episode of girls and the conjuring."
49:15;49:20;"So he probably gets, cause he's not full, he's not Matt Damon, but he's a very successful"
49:21;49:21;"actor."
49:21;49:25;"So he probably gets people all the time asking weird questions or just kind of bugging him."
49:25;49:28;"So I bet he walks in holding this mysterious watermelon."
49:28;49:34;"And this seems like a polite guy says, uh, Hey, Mr. Wilson, may I ask you a question?"
49:34;49:37;"And he's probably already like, where's this heading?"
49:37;49:43;"Instantly, like, of course, you know, the director, Todd Field,"
49:43;49:45;"do you know anything about his involvement with big league?"
49:45;49:53;"Choo? Well, I love that on the set of little children in 2005, 2006, it came up."
49:53;49:58;"It wasn't like, you know, that like Patrick had like independently like research this,"
49:58;49:59;"or it was like, why are we talking about?"
49:59;50:02;"Like, and somehow like, it'd be interesting to do the research."
50:02;50:08;"Like, did this come up when he was doing media in 2006 to promote little children?"
50:08;50:12;"Was there like a big league chew bump then?"
50:12;50:14;"Or was this, or is this unique to."
50:14;50:17;"He's just at craft services, chopping it up with Patrick Wilson and."
50:17;50:22;"And he's just talking about it, but also I like the Patrick Patrick Wilson knew the answer."
50:22;50:23;"No, no, no."
50:23;50:28;"He was also, I know this is probably Davin's language, but I just like picturing that."
50:28;50:33;"I mean, like, he started a buggy, Mr. Wilson, but do you know anything about if Todd Field ever,"
50:33;50:39;"uh, got paid for a big league too, or if you know anything about it?"
50:39;50:41;"And then Patrick Wilson goes, you know what?"
50:42;50:44;"He didn't get paid. I know that for a fact."
50:44;50:47;"And in fact, last I remember he was palpably dismayed."
50:47;50:49;"He was probably dismayed."
50:49;50:50;"Oh no, no."
50:50;50:50;"Yeah."
50:50;50:51;"He was probably dismayed."
50:51;50:54;"He received no credit nor remuneration."
50:54;50:56;"Okay."
50:56;50:58;"Thank you, Mr. Wilson."
50:58;51:02;"I bet in 2006, this information was not as readily available on the internet."
51:02;51:08;"You know, if you can look in the way back machine and see Todd Fields, Wikipedia entry in 2006,"
51:09;51:13;"I'm going to guess the big league shoe stuff wasn't on there."
51:13;51:13;"Yeah."
51:13;51:16;"I wonder if Todd Field saw Flamin' Hot."
51:16;51:18;"Might be too triggering for him."
51:18;51:21;"I'm going to guess no."
51:21;51:25;"We should do one of those, um, like Hollywood reporter variety round tables."
51:25;51:30;"Todd Field, Richard Montanez, Lara from Lara Bars."
51:30;51:34;"Just everybody, everybody who invented something talking about,"
51:35;51:38;"it's truly the opposite of the Montanez story."
51:38;51:43;"In that he, a person who maybe didn't invent something getting a lot of credit for it."
51:43;51:45;"Somebody who did getting none."
51:45;51:52;"Well, when we talked about it on big league bail, I think one of the big questions that we had was"
51:52;51:57;"also, we're just trying to paint a picture of his life because he seems like a true artist."
51:57;51:59;"He really takes his time between films."
51:59;52:01;"Like Jake, you said he's only made three films."
52:01;52:02;"Yeah."
52:02;52:04;"He's a really respected director."
52:04;52:08;"You can imagine, he must get offers to do the occasional,"
52:08;52:15;"you know, Marvel movie or direct a bunch of episodes of some TV show, you know, like do"
52:15;52:22;"commercials, whatever, uh, all the things that directors do sometimes, um, just to make a living."
52:22;52:26;"But it seems like he just, he takes years in between projects, developing his"
52:26;52:29;"Indie-ish type movies."
52:29;52:34;"And we wondered, can he take that time because he's so paid from big league shoe?"
52:34;52:35;"Seems like the answer is no."
52:35;52:39;"It's love of the game, dedicated to the art."
52:39;52:41;"He might even have some-"
52:41;52:43;"I think he does do a hedge."
52:43;52:44;"Okay."
52:44;52:50;"I listened to him on Marin and I could be wrong here, but I seem to remember this kind of coming up."
52:50;52:52;"And it'd be like, yeah."
52:52;52:54;"It's how he pays the bills in between movies."
52:54;52:55;"Yeah."
52:55;52:55;"Yeah."
52:55;52:57;"All right."
52:57;52:57;"Makes sense."
52:57;52:57;"Somewhere in between."
52:57;52:59;"Yep."
52:59;53:00;"I'm on his IMDB."
53:00;53:05;"Are we aware that Todd Field is also an actor with, uh, numerous credits?"
53:05;53:07;"He's in Eyes Wide Shut."
53:07;53:07;"Yeah."
53:07;53:08;"He plays Nick Nightingale."
53:08;53:09;"Nick Nightingale."
53:09;53:10;"I didn't realize that."
53:10;53:10;"Okay."
53:10;53:18;"Well, I think we had joked about, uh, that on that episode, Big League Bayo of Todd Field"
53:18;53:21;"on the set of Eyes Wide Shut with Stanley Kubrick."
53:21;53:21;"Oh, right."
53:21;53:22;"Yeah."
53:22;53:26;"Somehow pulling Stanley aside at Crafty and being like, let me tell you."
53:27;53:31;"And it's just him fuming over the Big League Chew debacle."
53:31;53:39;"Maybe sneaking in some Big League Chew onto that table as a way to sort of introduce it."
53:39;53:44;"Just the words Big League Chew being said at Tom Cruise and Stanley Kubrick."
53:44;53:47;"I bet Tom Cruise is eating some Big League Chew in his day."
53:47;53:48;"Oh yeah."
53:48;53:49;"Playing high school ball in New Jersey."
53:49;53:53;"Although it would have been a new product then."
53:53;53:53;"So."
53:53;53:56;"It was an instant hit."
53:57;54:04;"Yeah."
54:05;54:08;"Tell me what you want from me."
54:08;54:30;"Switching up your style but you're waiting too long."
54:33;54:37;"Pacing yourself and wasting yourself in the name of truth."
54:37;54:39;"But what's true?"
54:39;54:48;"Brother, baby, we've seen it all."
54:48;54:51;"And we're tired."
54:51;54:53;"So what you want from me?"
54:53;54:54;"I don't know."
54:54;55:01;"There's a song, my good friend Ian has sent it to me a couple times over the years."
55:01;55:03;"I think he's met the guy who made this song."
55:04;55:05;"And he sent it to me again recently."
55:05;55:08;"I'm like just saying, ""Oh yeah, I'm listening to that song again."""
55:08;55:10;"I remember hearing it the first time and being like, ""This is a very interesting song."""
55:10;55:13;"And this time I thought, ""You know what?"
55:13;55:17;"I want to send it to the TC crew because we should talk about it."""
55:17;55:19;"The artist is a guy named Andy Preboy."
55:19;55:23;"He must be in his 60s now."
55:23;55:27;"I was unfamiliar with him before I'd heard this song."
55:27;55:31;"And I guess the quick biography for him is that-"
55:31;55:32;"He's 68."
55:32;55:33;"He's 68."
55:33;55:38;"And he was the second singer in ""Wall of Voodoo."""
55:38;55:40;"You guys familiar with ""Wall of Voodoo""?"
55:40;55:42;"Yeah."
55:42;55:45;"So for anybody who doesn't know, you could throw on Mexican radio."
55:45;55:51;"""Wall of Voodoo,"" I guess somehow this song, ""Mexican Radio,"" was like a bit of a hit in the"
55:51;55:52;"early 80s."
55:52;55:57;"Pretty like out there, kind of dorky, divo-ish new wave."
55:58;56:04;"I remember just always seeing this pop up on compilation ads or watching some show on"
56:04;56:08;"VH1 and they'd be like, ""And this was kind of a weird hit in the early 80s."
56:08;56:10;"Mexican radio."""
56:10;56:13;"So this is the song that ""Wall of Voodoo"" is best known for."
56:13;56:19;"Kind of like a new wave, punky band where a lot of their imagery was kind of like"
56:19;56:24;"Southwestern, weird desert cowboy vibes."
56:24;56:26;"Very weird song to be a hit."
56:26;56:28;"I remember listening to Mexican radio a lot."
56:28;56:32;"I think it must have, right when it came out, what year did it come out?"
56:32;56:34;"Like '85 or something?"
56:34;56:35;"I think earlier."
56:35;56:37;"I had an older cousin that was really into it."
56:37;56:40;"And I remember listening to it a lot."
56:40;56:40;"It's great."
56:40;56:44;"It was kind of one of my earliest musical memories, to be honest."
56:44;56:45;"It's Mexican radio?"
56:45;56:46;"Yeah."
56:46;56:50;"So I always have like a, I wouldn't say a soft spot because I don't think it's a good"
56:50;56:51;"song."
56:51;56:55;"And even at the time I was sort of just like, ""Okay."""
56:55;56:59;"But he was like this older cousin of mine that we were like, you know, staying at like"
56:59;57:02;"a house up in New Hampshire for like a week together, our families."
57:02;57:08;"And it was just like, I think we were even sharing a room and he had like a little like"
57:08;57:09;"Walkman or something."
57:09;57:09;"I don't really know."
57:09;57:12;"And constant with the Mexican radio."
57:12;57:16;"He was walking around going, ""Mexican radio."""
57:16;57:18;"The song is actually '82."
57:18;57:19;"I think the video is '83."
57:19;57:21;"Yeah."
57:21;57:23;"This must have been like a little bit later than that."
57:23;57:28;"The 80s was a real golden age for a certain type of like dorky music."
57:28;57:35;"It's funny to think like Oingo Boingo, this, Devo, all kind of like popping at the same"
57:35;57:35;"time."
57:35;57:37;"But this is not Andy Preboy singing."
57:37;57:37;"No."
57:37;57:38;"Yeah."
57:38;57:40;"This is a long way of saying this is not Andy Preboy."
57:40;57:44;"This is Stan Ridsley."
57:44;57:48;"Whoa."
57:49;57:51;"Radio."
57:51;58:05;"This part."
58:05;58:19;"Radio."
58:19;58:27;"Okay."
58:27;58:29;"So anyway, we've heard enough."
58:29;58:29;"Yeah."
58:29;58:31;"That's a harsh palette."
58:31;58:34;"So this was this band Walla Voodoo."
58:34;58:37;"Anybody who knows Walla Voodoo, they probably first think of that song."
58:37;58:42;"The singer leaves the band and they go on to continue for a while with a new singer whose"
58:42;58:45;"name is Andy Preboy, who'd been in some other bands."
58:45;58:51;"Eventually, that incarnation of Walla Voodoo ends and Andy Preboy goes on to release a"
58:51;58:56;"bunch of solo albums through the 80s, 90s, all the way through now."
58:56;59:04;"He wrote one, a song called ""Tomorrow Wendy,"" which was covered by Concrete Blonde on their"
59:04;59:06;"hit album from 1990."
59:06;59:08;"You know, I looked him up after I heard the song, so all I really know about him."
59:08;59:11;"So this is a song he made in 2010."
59:11;59:17;"So he would have been in his 50s, I guess his mid-50s when he recorded this song."
59:17;59:22;"And it's a very eerie song called ""Bands."""
59:22;59:23;"Great title."
59:23;59:26;"Already, it's just like so fascinating."
59:26;59:29;"So this is Andy Preboy's ""Bands."""
59:29;59:33;"Ten years ago I'd meet a woman like her and I'd swear I'd fall in love."
59:33;59:38;"So I'd go and throw away the decent, pretty, but not beautiful, dedicated woman I had home"
59:38;59:43;"just to roll in the mud of common cigarette butts and burgundy menstrual blood."
59:43;59:46;"Soaking in a third-hand bed on a dirty bedspread."
59:46;59:49;"She'd talk about the bands and the bands she had."
59:49;59:51;"The bands she'd planned, the bands she'd led."
59:51;59:54;"The bands she'd dug, the bands she knew."
59:54;59:57;"The bands she'd loved and the bands she'd booed."
59:57;01:00:02;"This band, that band, every damn band, every damn band known to be the God or man."
01:00:02;01:00:06;"Nine years on we'd be living as one in a house so dirty I'd cry."
01:00:06;01:00:10;"And if it's the person, just your wife with anti-corporate metaphor."
01:00:10;01:00:14;"Though it smelled like somebody died inside a bohemian den."
01:00:14;01:00:17;"We'd be rocked all night with bohemian friends."
01:00:17;01:00:19;"Pythian women, Rabble-lazy men."
01:00:19;01:00:22;"Talked about the bands and the bands they're in."
01:00:22;01:00:24;"The bands they'd be and the bands they'd been."
01:00:24;01:00:27;"Bands they'd dug and the bands they knew."
01:00:27;01:00:29;"And the bands they ate and the bands they'd booed."
01:00:29;01:00:35;"This band, that band, every damn band, every damn band known to be the God or man."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"This is when I really got in."
01:00:36;01:00:38;"Every damn band, every damn band, every damn band known to be the God or man."
01:00:38;01:00:38;"This chorus."
01:00:38;01:00:45;"This band, that band, every damn band, every damn band known to be the God or man."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"All we ever talked about."
01:00:46;01:00:49;"These like romantic chords."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"I know, it's beautiful."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"Read a Rotary to bow."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"I heard the interview."
01:00:55;01:00:56;"What'd they do the tour without?"
01:00:56;01:00:59;"Or what they gonna do without?"
01:00:59;01:01:02;"I heard they had a falling out."
01:01:02;01:01:04;"What that falling out was all about."
01:01:04;01:01:09;"Like the oboe enters."
01:01:09;01:01:12;"It's like around this, I'm like, what is this song?"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"I mean, it really sounds like Lana Del Rey to me."
01:01:14;01:01:17;"Yeah, and this is before Lana Del Rey was doing anything."
01:01:17;01:01:19;"No, so long, I know."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"Maybe right when she came out."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"Eight years ago, I've had enough of that stuff."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"And my love for the girl was dead."
01:01:24;01:01:29;"Beside, I went and fell for a decent, pretty, but not beautiful, hardworking, well-dressed"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"woman with a home instead."
01:01:30;01:01:35;"Where we huffed and puffed and gushed on an antique Chippendale bed."
01:01:35;01:01:38;"And she stroked my head on the satin bedspread."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"I told her about the bands and the bands I led."
01:01:40;01:01:43;"The bands I joined and the bands I fled."
01:01:43;01:01:45;"The bands I dug and the bands I knew."
01:01:45;01:01:48;"Grand old bands and bands brand new."
01:01:48;01:01:53;"This band, that band, every damn band, every damn band underneath a God old man."
01:01:58;01:02:03;"This band, that band, every damn band, every damn band underneath a God old man."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"It's all we ever talked about."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"The only thing we knew."
01:02:06;01:02:09;"Read or wrote or read about."
01:02:09;01:02:11;"I heard the interview."
01:02:11;01:02:14;"They do the tour without."
01:02:14;01:02:17;"How are they gonna do without?"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"I heard they had a falling out."
01:02:20;01:02:22;"What that falling out was all about."
01:02:22;01:02:38;"So dramatic and mysterious."
01:02:38;01:02:44;"The end."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"Haunting."
01:02:45;01:02:53;"I mean, I can't think of many other songs that convey like the entire passage of time of someone's life."
01:02:53;01:02:58;"So succinctly, you know, really, he goes through three long term relationships."
01:02:58;01:03:02;"And yeah, he's just like a lifer in the music scene."
01:03:02;01:03:04;"He's just seen it all."
01:03:04;01:03:05;"No, truly."
01:03:05;01:03:11;"He's a guy in his mid 50s and he's like, it's slightly exhausted, but it's sweet."
01:03:11;01:03:15;"And it's it's really an extraordinary song."
01:03:15;01:03:16;"Yeah, that's how I'd put it."
01:03:16;01:03:17;"It really is extraordinary."
01:03:17;01:03:19;"And I think not a lot of people know this song."
01:03:19;01:03:26;"There's a cool little video that's that set to all these different images of bands on YouTube."
01:03:26;01:03:28;"And I think it has like 300 views or something."
01:03:28;01:03:28;"Oh, wow."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"Not a well-known piece of music."
01:03:29;01:03:36;"It kind of reminds me of, it's got that same haunted epic quality as like, you know, Frank Sinatra."
01:03:36;01:03:41;"When I was 17, it was a very good year."
01:03:41;01:03:45;"Except there is something comical, but also very real,"
01:03:45;01:03:53;"which I'm sure a certain type of TC had relates to, is this like compulsion to talk about bands."
01:03:53;01:03:55;"And this fact that he's like, it seems like through the song,"
01:03:55;01:03:58;"he's talking about three different relationships."
01:03:58;01:04:01;"He's got this like pretty, but not beautiful girl he got with."
01:04:01;01:04:06;"And then like nine years later, he's with a new girl and they're living in this messy house"
01:04:06;01:04:09;"with this kind of like pseudo anarchist vibe."
01:04:09;01:04:11;"And they have cool friends."
01:04:11;01:04:14;"And then later on, he's got yet another woman."
01:04:14;01:04:16;"He meets her and she takes him to his house."
01:04:16;01:04:19;"But it always ends up in the same place."
01:04:19;01:04:23;"Just talking about bands, this band, that band, bands that he was in, bands that he fled,"
01:04:23;01:04:28;"other people's bands, and just like this weird..."
01:04:28;01:04:32;"And then the music's so dramatic that it seems like this like dark obsession."
01:04:32;01:04:35;"This band, that band, everybody."
01:04:35;01:04:37;"Every damn band."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"You can't find the lyrics, but I think he's saying,"
01:04:39;01:04:45;"this band, that band, every damn band, every damn band, underneath a god or man."
01:04:45;01:04:52;"Basically, every band in the known universe just can't stop talking about them."
01:04:52;01:04:54;"Yeah. To me, like I said, it's almost like this..."
01:04:54;01:04:56;"It's very like novelistic."
01:04:56;01:04:59;"It's like Nosgard or like Proust or something."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"Yeah, yeah, totally."
01:05:00;01:05:08;"Like you can just picture like 10,000 cigarette addled, red wine chugging nights of sitting around"
01:05:08;01:05:11;"a kitchen table or on someone's porch."
01:05:11;01:05:13;"Yeah."
01:05:13;01:05:14;"Arguing about bands."
01:05:14;01:05:17;"I mean, we can all relate to it on this show."
01:05:17;01:05:17;"Yeah, of course."
01:05:17;01:05:21;"And there's something about the passage of time too, where it's like,"
01:05:21;01:05:26;"you picture when he's young and he's like getting passionate about culture for the first time."
01:05:26;01:05:31;"He's probably got like a young romance and everybody's like young and good looking and"
01:05:31;01:05:35;"just being like, ""What kind of bands are you into? Oh man, I love them."
01:05:35;01:05:39;"Like, oh, you want to be my girlfriend? Oh my God, first love."""
01:05:39;01:05:42;"Kind of exciting, probably going out to concerts."
01:05:42;01:05:45;"And then a little bit older where he's in the band,"
01:05:45;01:05:48;"he's talking about how they would host these parties and they have friends come over."
01:05:48;01:05:53;"And now I'm picturing maybe he's like late 20s, maybe even in his 30s."
01:05:53;01:05:56;"Got a cool bohemian crew, living a bohemian lifestyle."
01:05:56;01:05:58;"And he's got a band and he's like-"
01:05:58;01:06:03;"Well, first he ditched the girl that was a little more square, it sounds like."
01:06:03;01:06:08;"A little more like that he ditched her for the real rock and roll party chick."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"And then he's living the band lifestyle."
01:06:10;01:06:12;"He goes deep into that world."
01:06:12;01:06:15;"Like just a messy punk house."
01:06:15;01:06:19;"I'm picturing him just also, well, not necessarily Andy Prettyboy, but the guy in the song."
01:06:19;01:06:25;"I'm also just picturing kind of like local scene stir in a small city somewhere."
01:06:25;01:06:29;"Just like the type of dude, just be like, ""Oh man, I remember back in '88,"
01:06:29;01:06:30;"man, the local scene was hype."
01:06:30;01:06:33;"The Squirrels were sick."
01:06:33;01:06:37;"Human Nature, they were great."""
01:06:37;01:06:42;"Actually, the guy from Human Nature, then he started another band called Charge Machine."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"And actually, they were probably the best band of the era."
01:06:44;01:06:46;"And I played with the Squirrels sometimes."
01:06:46;01:06:48;"Do you remember Sylvia's Ghost?"
01:06:48;01:06:51;"Oh, no, actually I shared a bill with them more than once."
01:06:51;01:06:56;"And those guys, they would sometimes steal the show, but actually the bassist,"
01:06:56;01:07:00;"they had to kick the guy out because he was messed up on drugs at the time."
01:07:00;01:07:00;"You could just see it."
01:07:00;01:07:01;"Talking about bands."
01:07:01;01:07:04;"But actually, they found a new guy."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"He was in a band."
01:07:06;01:07:08;"He had been in Rollerball, actually."
01:07:08;01:07:09;"He had been in Rollerball."
01:07:09;01:07:13;"And when he joined, they actually had a record deal."
01:07:13;01:07:17;"They made it out to LA once and they opened for Wall of Voodoo."
01:07:18;01:07:22;"And then they lived out there for a few months and then they came back."
01:07:22;01:07:25;"It is so specific about the..."
01:07:25;01:07:32;"He talks about the bands on tour and somebody leaves the band and what's going to happen."
01:07:32;01:07:33;"But anyway, I agree."
01:07:33;01:07:35;"Second verse, he's in it."
01:07:35;01:07:37;"Got the bohemian lifestyle with the girl."
01:07:37;01:07:40;"And then it's in the third verse that..."
01:07:40;01:07:42;"Actually, can we throw this song on one more time?"
01:07:42;01:07:46;"The part that kills me in the third verse is that he meets the new girl who has a house"
01:07:46;01:07:47;"and a Chippendale bed."
01:07:47;01:07:49;"Is that like she's rich?"
01:07:49;01:07:53;"Gainfully employed or just responsible."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"She has health insurance, whatever."
01:07:55;01:07:58;"And he's like, ""Oh, okay."
01:07:58;01:08:00;"You have a house that's tidy with a nice bed."
01:08:00;01:08:04;"I'm going to just be the 36-year-old guy that moves in."""
01:08:04;01:08:07;"And he just starts talking to her like, ""You into music?"""
01:08:07;01:08:11;"I guess we bonded a lot about the restaurant scene."
01:08:11;01:08:12;"But are you into music?"
01:08:12;01:08:13;"""Oh, yeah."
01:08:13;01:08:13;"Yeah, I like music."
01:08:13;01:08:15;"I'm always putting on the radio."""

01:08:32;01:08:32;"It's okay, babe."

01:08:41;01:08:41;"Oh, right."

01:15:13;01:15:20;"for three sold-out weekend engagements, as well as two sold-out shows at New York's PS122."
01:15:20;01:15:25;"Pre-Boy and the crew also performed a medley from 'White Trash' on the Conan O'Brien show."""
01:15:25;01:15:26;"Interesting."
01:15:26;01:15:28;"I wonder if we could find YouTube of that."
01:15:28;01:15:31;"Also, because this song sounds like it could almost be from a musical."
01:15:31;01:15:34;"Well, yeah, when they said the Gilbert and Sullivan-esque treatment."
01:15:34;01:15:37;"Or maybe he started writing in that mode."
01:15:37;01:15:38;"Yeah."
01:15:38;01:15:39;"With those kind of chords."

01:15:58;01:16:03;"Maybe this is so obvious, but just the fact that the song is called ""Bands,"""
01:16:03;01:16:08;"and it's not even about being obsessed with music, that'd almost be too relatable."
01:16:08;01:16:17;"This is about a very specific dude who was born between 1950 and 2000."
01:16:17;01:16:23;"Let's give it a 50-year run, who just had this way of being specifically into bands."
01:16:23;01:16:27;"Not into music, not into singers, specifically bands."
01:16:27;01:16:32;"There's something so evocative about this, and kind of haunting about that obsession."
01:16:32;01:16:34;"Just being obsessed with bands."
01:16:34;01:16:36;"♪ This band, that band ♪"
01:16:36;01:16:41;"Actually, Jake, remember when we did a cold plunge together?"
01:16:41;01:16:42;"Yeah."
01:16:42;01:16:44;"When you were really cold in the cold plunge, you were like,"
01:16:44;01:16:47;"""Dude, dude, dude, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me."""
01:16:47;01:16:50;"You started referencing that Best Show sketch."
01:16:50;01:16:51;"Oh, right."
01:16:51;01:16:55;"Because I was in so much pain, and there was a classic Best Show sketch where"
01:16:55;01:16:58;"one of the John Worcester characters falls down the stairs,"
01:16:58;01:17:06;"and both of his arms and legs are broken, but the phone has landed right next to his mouth."
01:17:06;01:17:08;"He's dying, but he's like, ""Just talk to me, dude."""
01:17:08;01:17:12;"Then you just start talking about twin-tone bands."
01:17:12;01:17:15;"Start talking about '80s Soul Asylum albums."
01:17:15;01:17:18;"Really deep stuff."
01:17:18;01:17:22;"Really obscure bands stuff."
01:17:22;01:17:24;"I remember you're doing an impression of just like,"
01:17:24;01:17:27;"""I mean, what I just kind of can't get over, man,"
01:17:27;01:17:30;"is the sound of those early Soul Asylum albums."

01:17:39;01:17:41;"Maybe they just wanted to be Three Dog Night the whole time."
01:17:41;01:17:41;"I don't know."
01:17:42;01:17:42;"Ah!"
01:17:42;01:17:46;"That's totally like the comic version of this."
01:17:46;01:17:52;"Just like, last moments of life, just like thinking about Soul Asylum's trajectory."
01:17:52;01:17:57;"And your fight, and your dying moments."
01:17:57;01:18:02;"Bye, Seinfeld."
01:18:02;01:18:04;"All right, have a good one, Seinfeld."

01:20:42;01:20:45;"So many ways to see that I hold this door."

01:21:07;01:21:11;"The video features cameos from Aaliyah, Ginuwine, Playa, and Magoo."
01:21:11;01:21:15;"I can't believe this is 25 years ago."
01:21:15;01:21:16;"That's pretty crazy."
01:21:17;01:21:21;"25 years before 1998 would have been 1974."
01:21:21;01:21:22;"Yeah."
01:21:22;01:21:23;"No, 1973."
01:21:23;01:21:24;"I got what you want."
01:21:24;01:21:26;"Got what you need."
01:21:26;01:21:29;"Got what you need."
01:21:29;01:21:31;"Because it sounds very of its era, but it also,"
01:21:31;01:21:33;"but it sounds new."
01:21:33;01:21:35;"I know."
01:21:35;01:21:35;"I got what you want."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"Got what you need."

01:21:41;01:21:45;"Come on, this time I'm gonna make you hot."
01:21:45;01:21:50;"This would have been in between my junior and senior years of college."
01:21:50;01:21:51;"Yeah."
01:21:51;01:21:55;"This is also sounds pretty new because we're basically on the cycle where"
01:21:55;01:22:00;"this is being, this sound is being sampled and, you know,"
01:22:00;01:22:01;"Right."
01:22:01;01:22:04;"Sort of reappropriated for current songs."
01:22:04;01:22:08;"Like you could totally hear like Megan Thee Stallion, I expect, like over a similar."
01:22:08;01:22:10;"I got what you want."

01:22:52;01:22:56;"I got what you want."

01:23:22;01:23:23;"I could fly like a rocket."
01:23:23;01:23:26;"Yeah, 'cause this is the exact same era as like all those huge Aaliyah singles, like"

01:23:27;01:23:28;"Like, oh, no mess."

01:23:29;01:23:30;"Wait a minute."
01:23:30;01:23:34;"Such like a kind of iconic game-changing moment."
01:23:34;01:23:37;"The number four song this week in 1998."
01:23:37;01:23:40;"Oh, this is a very 1998 artist."
01:23:40;01:23:44;"Sarah McLachlan with ""Adia."""
01:23:44;01:23:46;"I don't know if I know this song."

01:23:57;01:24:02;"Don't you know I tried so hard to love you in my way."
01:24:05;01:24:08;"It's easy, let it go."
01:24:08;01:24:11;"Oh, you know this song when the chorus comes in."
01:24:11;01:24:18;"Yeah, I'm empty since you left me."
01:24:18;01:24:23;"Try to find a way to carry you."
01:24:23;01:24:24;"It's amazing."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"This is number four on the charts."
01:24:26;01:24:32;"I set myself and everyone to see what we went wrong."
01:24:33;01:24:36;"There's no one left to finger."
01:24:36;01:24:38;"There's no one here to blame."
01:24:38;01:24:42;"There's no one left to talk to, honey."
01:24:42;01:24:46;"And there ain't no one to buy our innocence."
01:24:46;01:24:54;"'Cause we are born innocent."
01:24:54;01:24:55;"Oh, yeah."
01:24:58;01:25:02;"We are still innocent."
01:25:02;01:25:08;"It's easy, we all falter."
01:25:08;01:25:12;"Does it matter?"
01:25:12;01:25:18;"Adia, I thought that we could make it."
01:25:18;01:25:23;"This song would also be a critically acclaimed song if it came out today."
01:25:23;01:25:24;"It'd be a very hipster song."
01:25:24;01:25:26;"I could picture--"
01:25:26;01:25:29;"Like, who's singing it?"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"Well, it has some Wiseblood moments."
01:25:31;01:25:35;"I could picture it changes the production a little bit, like a little bit of Wiseblood."
01:25:35;01:25:39;"'Cause actually, there's some surprising--"
01:25:39;01:25:43;"I mean, 'cause Wiseblood always has these bananas, chord changes,"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"like going all these unexpected places."
01:25:45;01:25:47;"But this has actually surprised me a few times too."
01:25:47;01:25:49;"Yeah?"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"Just for a top five song in the late '90s."
01:25:51;01:25:54;"This is a great song."
01:25:54;01:26:02;"Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent."
01:26:02;01:26:06;"That '70s easy listening chord."
01:26:06;01:26:07;"Yeah."
01:26:07;01:26:11;"I think at the time I sort of dismissed it as like, yeah,"
01:26:11;01:26:14;"basically like the '90s version of like soft rock."
01:26:14;01:26:19;"This is also a lot closer to Amy Mann than I would have guessed."
01:26:19;01:26:21;"You know, like if you asked me like--"
01:26:21;01:26:22;"Sure."
01:26:22;01:26:25;"Magnolia soundtrack, Amy Mann, Sarah McLachlan, I would have been like,"
01:26:25;01:26:26;"yeah, it's pretty different."
01:26:26;01:26:28;"But as I listen to it, it's not that far apart."
01:26:28;01:26:30;"No."
01:26:30;01:26:38;"'Cause we are born innocent."
01:26:38;01:26:39;"Where's Sarah McLachlan from?"
01:26:39;01:26:40;"Believe me, Adia."
01:26:40;01:26:41;"Is she Canadian?"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"I'm gonna guess that."
01:26:43;01:26:46;"Was she ever in a band?"
01:26:46;01:26:46;"Yeah."
01:26:46;01:26:48;"Canadian, dude."
01:26:48;01:26:50;"Born in '68."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"So she was 30."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"We are folder."
01:26:52;01:26:56;"Does it matter?"
01:26:56;01:27:05;"Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent."
01:27:05;01:27:14;"'Cause we are born innocent."
01:27:14;01:27:21;"Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent."
01:27:21;01:27:27;"'Cause we are still innocent."
01:27:27;01:27:30;"It's easy, we are folder."
01:27:30;01:27:34;"Does it matter?"
01:27:34;01:27:37;"Kind of a juicy backstory to this song."
01:27:37;01:27:38;"I know, I love the backstory."
01:27:38;01:27:45;"She said that Adia was about her, Sarah McLachlan, crossing a line by falling in love"
01:27:45;01:27:49;"with the ex of my best friend, who happened to be her drummer at the time."
01:27:50;01:27:54;"The song she said is about the aftermath of losing her best friend and her feelings of guilt."
01:27:54;01:28:00;"I'm thinking, was he the ex at that time or was he current?"
01:28:00;01:28:04;"Yeah, this level of guilt, was it a little bit of crossover?"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"All right, there's gotta be some crossover."
01:28:06;01:28:08;"I mean, yeah, that's pretty uncool."
01:28:08;01:28:16;"Just like putting the band together, your best friend's just like, ""Oh, you know my guy, Jason?"
01:28:16;01:28:19;"Oh yeah, I love Jason. He's such a cool guy."
01:28:19;01:28:20;"You know, he wants to audition for you."
01:28:20;01:28:22;"He's actually a sick drummer."
01:28:22;01:28:23;"You should come see him play sometime."""
01:28:23;01:28:24;"Okay."
01:28:24;01:28:26;"Hey, you know what, Adia?"
01:28:26;01:28:28;"Jason got the gig."
01:28:28;01:28:29;"Oh, I'm so happy."
01:28:29;01:28:31;"Oh, that's awesome."
01:28:31;01:28:33;"Like, that's so cool."
01:28:33;01:28:35;"Oh, I'm gonna come to a lot of the shows."
01:28:35;01:28:36;"Yeah, no, it's gonna be awesome."
01:28:36;01:28:39;"Then Jason gets home from tour."
01:28:39;01:28:41;"Adia, we need to talk."
01:28:41;01:28:42;"Breaks up with her."
01:28:44;01:28:48;"Couple weeks later, Adia sees Sarah McLachlan and Jason having brunch."
01:28:48;01:28:50;"Come on."
01:28:50;01:28:53;"That's not a good feeling."
01:28:53;01:28:54;"She puts two and two together."
01:28:54;01:28:56;"I mean, she had the intuition already."
01:28:56;01:28:57;"She knew something was up."
01:28:57;01:29:00;"Jason was a little distant on the calls back home."
01:29:00;01:29:03;"Rest of the band is just like, ""Whoa."""
01:29:03;01:29:05;"Mom's the word."
01:29:05;01:29:08;"Yeah, they're noticing, rolling their eyes."
01:29:08;01:29:12;"All right, guys, that's between you."
01:29:12;01:29:16;"What was the first Sarah McLachlan?"
01:29:16;01:29:17;"Is it McLaughlin or McGlock?"
01:29:17;01:29:20;"I always thought it was McGlock-lin."
01:29:20;01:29:21;"McGlock-lin."
01:29:21;01:29:21;"No."
01:29:21;01:29:22;"Isn't there..."
01:29:22;01:29:23;"McGlocklin, you know what?"
01:29:23;01:29:24;"Wait, wasn't it called Angel?"
01:29:24;01:29:28;"What's the one that they always play in those sad commercials about animals?"
01:29:28;01:29:32;"Like, you know, about like abused dogs and cats."
01:29:32;01:29:36;"She had like an up-tempo song with this like sick bass line in it"
01:29:36;01:29:39;"that I remember really liking in like 1994."
01:29:39;01:29:40;"'94?"
01:29:40;01:29:41;"Is it Sarah McLachlan?"

01:51:18;01:51:20;"but this is what he's supposed to do."
01:51:20;01:51:21;"And he knows it."
01:51:21;01:51:24;"All right, let's try to get him on the show next episode."
01:51:24;01:51:25;"- Mutt."
01:51:25;01:51:27;"- Mutt, come on TC."
01:51:27;01:51:29;"We know you don't do interviews, but come on, man."
01:51:29;01:51:37;"Yeah, you're still the one. Just a beautiful song. Very 1998 sounding. Sounds great. I"
01:51:37;01:51:39;"loved everything about the way that sounded."
01:51:39;01:51:41;"Yes, sounded timeless."
01:51:41;01:51:46;"The number one song this week, which of course I remember so well from this era, this was"
01:51:46;01:51:52;"on the radio all the time, on MTV all the time. Brandy and Monica, ""The Boy is Mine."""
01:51:52;01:51:53;"Just a monster hit."
01:51:53;01:51:59;"The boy is mine, the boy is mine, the boy is mine, the boy is mine, the boy is mine."
01:51:59;01:52:12;"Oh yeah, I love that keyboard harp sound."
01:52:12;01:52:16;"This was inspired by the Michael Jackson-Paul McCartney duet, ""The Girl is Mine,"" as well"
01:52:16;01:52:19;"as by the Jerry Springer show."
01:52:19;01:52:21;"Weird. What does that mean?"
01:52:21;01:52:26;"Brandy came up with its concept while watching an episode of Springer where love triangles"
01:52:26;01:52:27;"among the guests was the theme."
01:52:27;01:52:28;"I see."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"Yeah, love triangles."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"Love is in the air in this, in '98."
01:52:30;01:52:31;"I love that synth strings."
01:52:31;01:52:32;"Yeah. Starts with a chorus."
01:52:32;01:53:00;"Wow, this is number one for 13 weeks."
01:53:00;01:53:08;"Do you think that there's anything about all this idea of the infidelity? We're looking"
01:53:08;01:53:11;"at '98, Clinton era."
01:53:11;01:53:12;"Oh yeah."
01:53:12;01:53:17;"I don't know what's in the... Is there something that every one of these songs is about? ""He's"
01:53:17;01:53:21;"not yours, he's mine,"" or ""I took care of her from the..."""
01:53:21;01:53:28;"Right. In a time of major prosperity for Americans, maybe people get more into issues like this."
01:53:28;01:53:47;"So you're saying Bob Dole in '96."
01:53:47;01:53:53;"Oh yeah, this is song's number one for 13 weeks."
01:53:53;01:53:58;"Hell no. Not in Bob Dole's America."
01:53:58;01:54:02;"He belongs to me, the heart is mine."
01:54:02;01:54:04;"Watch you do the things you do."
01:54:04;01:54:07;"You keep on acting like a fool."
01:54:07;01:54:10;"You need to know it's me, not you."
01:54:10;01:54:13;"Well, if you didn't know it, girl, it's true."
01:54:13;01:54:15;"Think now you should realize."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"Try to understand why."
01:54:17;01:54:20;"He is a part of my life."
01:54:20;01:54:23;"I know it's killing you inside."
01:54:23;01:54:25;"You can say what you wanna say."
01:54:25;01:54:28;"What we have, you can't take."
01:54:28;01:54:30;"From the truth, you can't escape."
01:54:30;01:54:33;"I can tell the real from the fake."
01:54:33;01:54:35;"When will you get the picture?"
01:54:35;01:54:38;"You're the best in the future."
01:54:38;01:54:41;"Get away, it's my time to shine."
01:54:41;01:54:44;"If you didn't know the boy is mine."
01:54:44;01:54:46;"I need to give it up."
01:54:46;01:54:49;"I've had it loud enough."
01:54:49;01:54:51;"It's not hard to see."
01:54:51;01:54:54;"To see that our boy is mine."
01:54:54;01:54:57;"I'm sorry that I'm bigger than you."
01:54:57;01:55:00;"Seem to be confused."
01:55:00;01:55:05;"I'm too busy to be the one."
01:55:05;01:55:08;"I'm sorry that I'm bigger than you."
01:55:08;01:55:11;"I'm too busy to be the one."
01:55:11;01:55:13;"To see him, I need the boy."
01:55:13;01:55:15;"I need the boy."
01:55:15;01:55:18;"I'm sorry that I'm bigger than you."
01:55:18;01:55:21;"I'm too busy to be the one."
01:55:21;01:55:25;"It's just like, listen, it's my guy."
01:55:25;01:55:27;"It's over between you."
01:55:27;01:55:30;"Whereas LL clearly gets off on the cheating aspect."
01:55:30;01:55:32;"He doesn't even want the girl."
01:55:32;01:55:34;"And he doesn't even want her to break up with you."
01:55:34;01:55:37;"He loves sneaking in your house when you're at work."
01:55:37;01:55:40;"I'm the one to bump into."
01:55:40;01:55:43;"Special places in my heart."
01:55:43;01:55:46;"Cause my body is mine."
01:55:46;01:55:50;"I mean, what a just absolutely horrible piece of sh*t character to play."
01:55:50;01:55:52;"It's great."
01:55:52;01:55:54;"I'm that type."
01:55:54;01:55:57;"It's not even like Mr. Steal Your Girl."
01:55:57;01:55:59;"Okay, Stealer."
01:55:59;01:56:02;"What's with these sick mind games, LL?"
01:56:02;01:56:04;"If you want the girl, take her."
01:56:04;01:56:07;"It's really funny cause there's even, you get a sense of the you."
01:56:07;01:56:10;"Like LL Cool J's, there's not one guy."
01:56:10;01:56:12;"It's all of you."
01:56:12;01:56:13;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:56:13;01:56:14;"It's sort of like."
01:56:14;01:56:15;"The whole world."
01:56:15;01:56:17;"This isn't addressed to one guy."
01:56:17;01:56:18;"And I'm really into his girl."
01:56:18;01:56:20;"It's like, yeah, it's the whole world."
01:56:20;01:56:21;"All of you guys."
01:56:21;01:56:22;"I'm that guy."
01:56:22;01:56:25;"He belongs to me."
01:56:25;01:56:27;"Cause my body is mine."
01:56:27;01:56:29;"Don't need to get high up."
01:56:29;01:56:32;"But I had a f*cking high up."
01:56:32;01:56:34;"But now you see."
01:56:34;01:56:37;"My body is mine."
01:56:37;01:56:39;"I'm sorry that you."
01:56:39;01:56:42;"Seem to be confused."
01:56:42;01:56:44;"He belongs to me."
01:56:44;01:56:47;"Her body is mine."
01:56:47;01:56:50;"1998 Strong Top 5."
01:56:50;01:56:51;"Very strong."
01:56:51;01:56:53;"Alright."
01:56:53;01:56:57;"Just a nice soft ending here."
01:56:57;01:56:58;"Yep."
01:56:58;01:57:00;"Alright, well."
01:57:00;01:57:03;"Even though we've been a little bit hard on the character you play in the song."
01:57:03;01:57:05;"I'm that type of guy."
01:57:05;01:57:08;"We still gotta give a big shout out to LL Cool J."
01:57:08;01:57:09;"Great rapper."
01:57:09;01:57:11;"Lots of excellent songs."
01:57:11;01:57:16;"He has a song from, I think like '87 called ""I Need Love""."
01:57:16;01:57:17;"Mac, can you put that on?"
01:57:17;01:57:19;"And that can be our."
01:57:19;01:57:20;"Oh yeah."
01:57:20;01:57:23;"He's playing a much nicer character."
01:57:23;01:57:24;"I love ""I Need Love""."
01:57:24;01:57:26;"Oh yeah, beautiful song."
01:57:26;01:57:27;"You know, this is what is it?"
01:57:27;01:57:31;"All superheroes grow to be the villain or something like that."
01:57:31;01:57:33;"What's that expression?"
01:57:33;01:57:35;"This is an early."
01:57:35;01:57:36;"This is origin LL story."
01:57:36;01:57:37;"This is the origin."
01:57:37;01:57:39;"He's a sensitive guy."
01:57:39;01:57:40;"When I'm alone in my room."
01:57:40;01:57:42;"Sometimes I stare at the wall."
01:57:42;01:57:43;"And in the back of my mind."
01:57:43;01:57:44;"I hear my conscience call."
01:57:44;01:57:47;"Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove."
01:57:47;01:57:49;"I love how minimal this is."
01:57:49;01:57:50;"Yeah."
01:57:50;01:57:51;"There I was."
01:57:51;01:57:54;"Giggling about the games that I had played with many hearts."
01:57:54;01:57:55;"And I'm not saying no names."
01:57:55;01:57:56;"Then the thought occurred."
01:57:56;01:57:58;"Tear drops made my eyes."
01:57:58;01:57:59;"That's a cool narrative arc."
01:57:59;01:58:01;"This guy to that guy."
01:58:01;01:58:03;"Well, maybe it's the opposite."
01:58:03;01:58:04;"Even though this came earlier."
01:58:04;01:58:06;"He said he used to play a lot of games."
01:58:06;01:58:09;"But then his conscience started creeping in."
01:58:09;01:58:12;"I was thinking he just was hurt one too many times."
01:58:12;01:58:14;"You know what I mean?"
01:58:14;01:58:15;"And he just broke."
01:58:15;01:58:17;"Maybe he's been alternating between these two modes his whole life."
01:58:17;01:58:22;"Alright."
01:58:22;01:58:24;"LL Cool J with I Need Love."
01:58:24;01:58:25;"We'll see you next time."
01:58:55;01:58:57;"Romance, sheer delight."
01:58:57;01:58:58;"How sweet."
01:58:58;01:59:00;"I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete."
01:59:00;01:59:02;"You can scratch my back."
01:59:02;01:59:03;"We'll get cozy and huddle."
01:59:03;01:59:06;"I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle."
01:59:06;01:59:07;"I'll give you a rose."
01:59:07;01:59:09;"Pull out your chair before we eat."
01:59:09;01:59:11;"Kiss you on the cheek and say, ""Ooh, girl, you're so sweet."""
01:59:11;01:59:14;"It's déjà vu whenever I'm with you."
01:59:14;01:59:17;"I could go on forever telling you what I do."
01:59:17;01:59:18;"But where you at?"
01:59:18;01:59:19;"You're neither here nor there."
01:59:19;01:59:22;"I swear I can't find you anywhere."
01:59:22;01:59:25;"Damn sure ain't in my closet or under my rug."
01:59:25;01:59:28;"This love search is really making me bug."
01:59:28;01:59:30;"And if you know who you are, why don't you make yourself seen?"
01:59:30;01:59:33;"Take a chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean."
01:59:33;01:59:36;"Fantasies can run, but they can't hide."
01:59:36;01:59:38;"And when I find you, I'ma pour all my love inside."
01:59:38;01:59:39;"I need love."
01:59:39;01:59:44;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
