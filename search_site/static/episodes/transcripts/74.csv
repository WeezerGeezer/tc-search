00:05;00:08;"Time Crisis, reunited once again."
00:08;00:11;"On today's episode, we talk about cold brew."
00:11;00:13;"What is it? Does it taste sour?"
00:13;00:15;"We'll talk to the experts."
00:15;00:20;"Jake and I also talk about Jason Alexander, a.k.a. George Costanza's star turn"
00:20;00:23;"as Colonel Sanders in the new KFC ad."
00:23;00:27;"All this, plus we count down the hits of 2018 and 1999."
00:27;00:31;"This is a very cold brew episode of..."
00:31;00:35;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:35;00:37;"Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep."
00:37;00:39;"Spawn in one."
01:14;01:25;"Time Crisis back again. Jake, what's up, man?"
01:25;01:26;"It's been a minute."
01:26;01:29;"It has been a minute. I've been all over the place."
01:29;01:31;"Australia, Japan, Chicago."
01:31;01:32;"Do tell."
01:32;01:35;"It was funny. We went to Australia and Japan, and it's like a long tour."
01:35;01:37;"It was a two-week tour with two shows."
01:37;01:39;"Yeah, I remember we discussed this."
01:39;01:42;"All the gear routing was a bit of a headache."
01:42;01:43;"Rocket cargo."
01:43;01:44;"Right."
01:44;01:49;"In Australia, our keyboardist, Will ""Buckethead"" Canzanare, didn't have the real piano."
01:49;01:50;"Where was it?"
01:50;01:55;"I guess they had to ship the piano to Japan, so he did MIDI piano in Australia."
01:55;01:57;"Do you guys ship a real piano?"
01:57;01:58;"Apparently."
01:58;01:59;"That's wild."
01:59;02:00;"We're shipping a freight anyway."
02:00;02:02;"Might as well throw a piano on there."
02:02;02:04;"Yeah, it's not that much bigger than everything else."
02:04;02:05;"How were the shows?"
02:05;02:06;"They were both tight."
02:06;02:08;"I mean, it's a little funny."
02:08;02:14;"I think I said this on the last episode or one episode about, you know, we booked these shows way in advance."
02:14;02:16;"Festivals book almost a year early."
02:16;02:17;"That's wild."
02:17;02:18;"So you're doing a lot of guesswork."
02:18;02:20;"Will the album be done?"
02:20;02:21;"We're going to be ready to play new stuff."
02:21;02:22;"You hope so."
02:22;02:27;"So all things considered, that we're not playing any new material, they're going really well."
02:27;02:28;"Were people giving you guff?"
02:28;02:29;"No."
02:29;02:30;"People seemed psyched."
02:30;02:33;"And, you know, we got all the new musicians, and we're playing some stuff differently,"
02:33;02:34;"and we're having fun."
02:34;02:39;"So, you know, I think given that we're in a kind of weird interim period, we're still putting on a good show."
02:39;02:40;"Undoubtedly."
02:40;02:43;"I caught a good 45 minutes of the Chicago show."
02:43;02:44;"Oh, on the live stream?"
02:44;02:45;"Live stream."
02:45;02:46;"Oh, man."
02:46;02:49;"Saturday night, I was driving Hannah's Prius."
02:49;02:50;"Really?"
02:50;02:53;"Down to go see Sorry to Bother You at the Hollywood Arclight."
02:53;02:54;"Oh, tight."
02:54;02:55;"Got caught in some traffic."
02:55;02:57;"That's just what was on?"
02:57;03:00;"Caught like a, I was like, I'm just going to hang with this."
03:00;03:02;"Solid 40 minutes."
03:02;03:03;"Wow."
03:03;03:07;"I mean, it's really stressful to me that we have to do all these festivals that have live streams."
03:07;03:12;"Because sometimes even more people watch/listen to the streams than are even there."
03:12;03:15;"And there's a part of me that's like, I can't monitor the mix."
03:15;03:19;"Bayo told me that the live stream of Yahé sounded like shreds."
03:19;03:20;"I actually caught that."
03:20;03:21;"Because that's like."
03:21;03:22;"He said it sounded insane."
03:22;03:23;"That was the closer, right?"
03:23;03:24;"It was towards the end."
03:24;03:29;"But it's because we have like all these effects on his mic because he's singing Yahé, and it goes like, Yahé."
03:29;03:32;"That mic that's all f***ed up was picking up the bass."
03:32;03:34;"So apparently just like driving everything insane."
03:34;03:38;"I wondered about that because his bass sounded crazily out of tune."
03:38;03:41;"And I was like, there's no way his bass is actually out of tune."
03:41;03:42;"I know."
03:42;03:44;"These are the things that happen with live streams."
03:44;03:46;"Like, and they just drive me crazy."
03:46;03:47;"But whatever."
03:47;03:48;"You live and you learn."
03:48;03:50;"And hopefully people are as charitable as you."
03:50;03:53;"Oh, sweet thing."
03:53;03:56;"Zion doesn't love you."
03:58;04:01;"Babylon don't love you."
04:01;04:06;"But you love everything."
04:06;04:14;"Oh, you saint."
04:14;04:17;"America don't love you."
04:17;04:22;"So I could never love you."
04:24;04:28;"It's part of everything."
04:28;04:36;"In the dark of this place, there's the glow of your face."
04:36;04:41;"There's the dust on the screen of this broken machine."
04:41;04:46;"And I can't help but feel that I made some mistake."
04:46;04:48;"But I let it go."
04:48;04:52;"Yahé, Yahé, Yahé."
04:52;04:55;"Through the fire and through the flames."
04:55;04:58;"Yahé, Yahé, Yahé."
05:01;05:03;"Yahé, Yahé, Yahé."
05:03;05:05;"You won't even say your name."
05:05;05:08;"Yahé, Yahé, Yahé."
05:11;05:13;"Yahé, Yahé, Yahé."
05:13;05:16;"Through the fire and through the flames."
05:16;05:18;"You won't even say your name."
05:18;05:22;"Only I'm that I am."
05:22;05:26;"Who could ever live that way?"
05:26;05:30;"What's your way?"
05:30;05:34;"I ask what's your, your."
05:34;05:35;"Lollapalooza was great."
05:35;05:37;"That one was a little more nerve-wracking"
05:37;05:39;"'cause the other ones were like, you know, in other countries."
05:39;05:42;"Lollapalooza's first time back on American soil."
05:42;05:43;"Post Ojai."
05:43;05:44;"Post Ojai's."
05:44;05:45;"Post, uh..."
05:45;05:47;"We did all these little shows."
05:47;05:49;"Regional SoCal shows."
05:49;05:52;"It was our first time back on American soil at a festival."
05:52;05:53;"People amped."
05:53;05:54;"And again with no music."
05:54;05:55;"I mean, well, here's the thing."
05:55;05:56;"Yes, people were amped."
05:56;05:57;"The crowd was crazy."
05:57;05:59;"We've always had great fans in Chicago."
05:59;06:02;"But again, in the years since we've been gone,"
06:02;06:05;"rock went from being played out"
06:05;06:07;"to almost being non-existent."
06:07;06:09;"A shovel full of dirt on that coffin."
06:09;06:10;"Exactly."
06:10;06:12;"I feel like five years ago,"
06:12;06:14;"it was like a funny debate people would have"
06:14;06:15;"about is rock dead?"
06:15;06:17;"And now people don't even want to talk about it."
06:17;06:19;"And then, you know, when you're a musician,"
06:19;06:21;"you hear through the grapevine all the festivals happening,"
06:21;06:22;"you hear these horror stories."
06:22;06:25;"I'm not gonna name names, but like somebody will say to me,"
06:25;06:27;"""Did you hear that that band that you liked,"
06:27;06:29;"they were up against..."""
06:29;06:30;"That DJ."
06:30;06:31;"That DJ, that rapper, whatever."
06:31;06:35;"And I'm like, ""Okay, well, that sounds like a good choice."""
06:35;06:37;"People who want to see that, they're like,"
06:37;06:38;"""It was harsh, man."
06:38;06:40;"Crowd didn't even make it to front of house."""
06:40;06:43;"Front of house is just like the front?"
06:43;06:45;"No, front of house is where the sound guy is."
06:45;06:46;"Okay."
06:46;06:48;"So you know at a festival, there's always like a little tent where the--"
06:48;06:49;"Right."
06:49;06:50;"So that's like a pretty good--"
06:50;06:52;"That's like back like 100 feet or something."
06:52;06:53;"Maybe even farther, yeah."
06:53;06:54;"Yeah."
06:54;06:56;"But it also means that for the person on stage,"
06:56;06:57;"like we're at Lollapalooza,"
06:57;06:59;"I couldn't see where the crowd ended."
06:59;07:01;"It might have ended just past where I could see,"
07:01;07:02;"but at least I'm looking out,"
07:02;07:04;"and I'm just kind of like, ""Okay."""
07:04;07:06;"So anyway, I've just been hearing things like, you know,"
07:06;07:09;"it can be tough out there for the aging rock band."
07:09;07:12;"The shins didn't get their front of house."
07:12;07:14;"I didn't say that."
07:14;07:15;"They're up against The Weeknd."
07:15;07:16;"Well, we were against The Weeknd."
07:16;07:18;"The Weeknd mopped the floor with the shins."
07:18;07:20;"That was also funny is that we were up against The Weeknd."
07:20;07:21;"At the same time?"
07:21;07:22;"Literally the same time."
07:22;07:23;"Wow."
07:23;07:25;"We're a mile apart, either side of Grant Park,"
07:25;07:26;"and we're just there."
07:26;07:27;"And I was kind of into it."
07:27;07:28;"A mile? Wow."
07:28;07:30;"No, that's how Lollapalooza works."
07:30;07:31;"They have two headliners,"
07:31;07:33;"although one's always kind of like the real headliner,"
07:33;07:34;"and one's like the second headliner."
07:34;07:35;"Yeah."
07:35;07:37;"So, you know, you get these like funny pairings."
07:37;07:40;"Like the night before is like The National versus Bruno Mars,"
07:40;07:42;"and we're at Vampire Weekend versus The Weeknd."
07:42;07:43;"Wow."
07:43;07:46;"And also there was like this big DJ Zedd was playing at the same time."
07:46;07:48;"It was like a pretty stacked lineup."
07:48;07:50;"So three people going at the same time."
07:50;07:51;"Probably even more."
07:51;07:52;"Weekend versus Weekend."
07:52;07:54;"It was Weekend versus Weekend, which I found kind of interesting."
07:54;07:55;"Yeah."
07:55;07:57;"And, you know, I was also a little nervous,"
07:57;07:59;"because like obviously we're not here with like a whole new show."
07:59;08:01;"We're not even playing any new material."
08:01;08:02;"And then on top of that--"
08:02;08:03;"This oldies act."
08:03;08:05;"Oldies act Vampire Weekend."
08:05;08:06;"And then on top of that, you know,"
08:06;08:08;"we got like some new shredders,"
08:08;08:13;"letting Brian Jones get into some Santana [expletive] on New Dorp."
08:13;08:14;"I heard that, dude."
08:14;08:15;"He's a shredder."
08:15;08:17;"He's starting to stretch out a little bit."
08:17;08:19;"Yeah, because I caught three shows live,"
08:19;08:21;"and he seemed pretty restrained,"
08:21;08:25;"and it seems slowly but surely he's coming out of that shell."
08:25;08:26;"He's coming to his own."
08:26;08:27;"Yeah."
08:27;08:29;"And also it's like funny too how--"
08:29;08:31;"It's kind of like the pop model."
08:31;08:33;"It's like when a pop star comes back,"
08:33;08:36;"it's kind of like, ""Welcome to the new era."
08:36;08:38;"Lady Gaga's back."""
08:38;08:43;"And this time she's into robots and dominatrix [expletive]"
08:43;08:44;"whereas like at the end of the album--"
08:44;08:47;"And the next album it's like 1950s Betty Draper."
08:47;08:48;"Yeah, exactly."
08:48;08:49;"Okay."
08:49;08:52;"And of course I connect to that in some ways as an artist,"
08:52;08:53;"but we're also just a band."
08:53;08:55;"You know, we're like a group of people who play music."
08:55;08:56;"Right."
08:56;08:58;"So there's also--with us there's like this feeling of like"
08:58;09:02;"this new crew of musicians, we've played seven shows together."
09:02;09:03;"Right."
09:03;09:05;"From a touring perspective as far as a band goes,"
09:05;09:07;"it's not like in Ojai we were kind of just like,"
09:07;09:09;"""Welcome to the new era."""
09:09;09:11;"I mean, unless you say the new era is about being laid back"
09:11;09:12;"and having fun."
09:12;09:14;"For me it's like we played seven shows."
09:14;09:17;"We'll probably hit our stride like April 2019."
09:17;09:18;"You know what I mean?"
09:18;09:20;"Yeah, I was going to say like show 30."
09:20;09:22;"Yeah, especially once we got to learn the new stuff."
09:22;09:24;"You're like a baseball team, man."
09:24;09:25;"You need like spring training."
09:25;09:26;"Yeah, exactly."
09:26;09:27;"You're not warmed up yet."
09:27;09:28;"It's not even opening day."
09:28;09:29;"Exactly."
09:29;09:31;"The record's not out."
09:31;09:32;"I know, but--"
09:32;09:34;"It's a long season, guys."
09:34;09:35;"We're on an old-fashioned timeline."
09:35;09:36;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
09:36;09:40;"Sometimes people apply a certain type of like pop timeline"
09:40;09:41;"to Rockman."
09:41;09:42;"You're just like, ""No."""
09:42;09:43;"Yeah, yeah."
09:43;09:44;"It just doesn't work for us."
09:44;09:48;"Like in some ways I'm glad that the album wasn't done/out by now"
09:48;09:49;"because I'm kind of like, ""You know what?"
09:49;09:50;"We need our spring training."""
09:50;09:51;"Yeah, it's going to work out."
09:51;09:54;"It's a little funny that spring training is in front of"
09:54;09:57;"30,000 to 40,000 people at Lollapalooza,"
09:57;10:00;"plus who knows how many people in Priuses around the world."
10:00;10:02;"Oh, hundreds of thousands."
10:02;10:03;"But I'm kind of into that."
10:03;10:05;"It's like, ""What's up with that bass?"""
10:05;10:06;"Yeah."
10:06;10:10;"It's funny to think about people in like every major city"
10:10;10:15;"and smaller secondary tertiary city, small towns all across America,"
10:15;10:17;"catching that live stream."
10:17;10:19;"Is that bass?"
10:19;10:23;"I mean, but also that's the kind of s--t that I also love in a way."
10:23;10:27;"It's like this is not Lady Gaga's new era coming correct."
10:27;10:29;"It's like we're working the kinks out."
10:34;10:37;"Today we're born again"
10:37;10:40;"There's new grass on the hill"
10:40;10:45;"Around the third and headed for home"
10:45;10:48;"It's a brown-eyed handsome man"
10:48;10:53;"Anyone can understand the way I feel"
10:53;10:58;"Oh, put me in code"
10:58;11:02;"I'm ready to play today"
11:02;11:05;"Put me in code"
11:05;11:09;"I'm ready to play today"
11:09;11:12;"Look at me, I can be"
11:12;11:14;"San Diego"
11:14;11:16;"Seinfeld, you were monitoring some of this."
11:16;11:18;"I saw this way after the fact on Time Crisis"
11:18;11:21;"that we got a little bit of pushback for opening with A-Punk three times."
11:21;11:25;"Yeah, I saw a lot of like music blog type headlines"
11:25;11:29;"like Vampire Weekend played A-Punk three times in the Seinfeld theme."
11:29;11:32;"So you guys opened, okay I missed this completely."
11:32;11:36;"You opened with A-Punk three times."
11:36;11:37;"In a row."
11:37;11:40;"Yeah, and this is an idea that I'd had a very long time ago."
11:40;11:42;"Hopefully I don't get in trouble for being too inside baseball."
11:42;11:44;"All this stuff was speculative"
11:44;11:47;"because you always get festival offers even when you're not really out there."
11:47;11:51;"And I remember at some point hearing like you guys maybe could play Coachella last year."
11:51;11:53;"And I was like, I don't know."
11:53;11:54;"They're like, well it could be a really good slot."
11:54;11:55;"You could play before Beyonce."
11:55;11:57;"It looked like maybe we could have that slot."
11:57;12:00;"And at first I was like, that's amazing."
12:00;12:03;"And then I thought about it, I was like, oh no, no, no, that's bad."
12:03;12:05;"I don't want Vampire Weekend playing before Beyonce."
12:05;12:07;"And then I was thinking, well what could we do?"
12:07;12:09;"Say we rushed to get it ready."
12:09;12:12;"What are the types of things that we could do without a lot of new music"
12:12;12:14;"and without a lot of money to put on a great show?"
12:14;12:18;"Because you put on a great show, but you know it's a very expensive show."
12:18;12:22;"And then I was like, well what are the types of things that a band can do just with the music?"
12:22;12:25;"You could extend a song, jam it, that's one thing."
12:25;12:26;"Eight minute Cape Cod."
12:26;12:27;"Do eight minute Cape Cod."
12:27;12:29;"Eight minute Cape Cod."
12:29;12:30;"And what's another thing you could do?"
12:30;12:32;"You could play a song multiple times in a row."
12:32;12:33;"Just get people worked up."
12:33;12:34;"I was like, oh maybe--"
12:34;12:35;"I also kind of like this."
12:35;12:39;"Just some weird John Cage, like Brian Eno, like conceptual stuff."
12:39;12:41;"I didn't even think about it that way."
12:41;12:45;"First of all, I just knew that the real Vampire Weekend fans would just get it instantly."
12:45;12:46;"They're just like, it's fun."
12:46;12:47;"Yeah."
12:47;12:51;"And there's also a part of me that's also like, I kind of resent the idea that you've got to roll up to a festival"
12:51;12:53;"putting on like an avant-garde theater show."
12:53;12:55;"Not that there's anything wrong with that."
12:55;12:57;"I'm just kind of like, we're just here to play music, man."
12:57;12:59;"It's not that serious."
12:59;13:02;"So I kind of like the idea also of opening with our biggest song."
13:02;13:05;"I don't think anybody interpreted it this way, but my thought was,"
13:05;13:07;"A-Punk is our most well-known song, right?"
13:07;13:11;"Historically, when you're an artist playing, you hold back on your most well-known song"
13:11;13:14;"until final third, if not the last song."
13:14;13:15;"Encore."
13:15;13:16;"And I was like, you know what?"
13:16;13:18;"Vampire Weekend, we've got a great catalog."
13:18;13:20;"I think our catalog's second to none."
13:20;13:22;"Got three albums of great music."
13:22;13:25;"I kind of thought it was funny to also just come out so hard in the beginning,"
13:25;13:28;"burn off our best-known song, almost unlike a dare."
13:28;13:30;"It's like, you want to go watch The Weeknd?"
13:30;13:32;"Go."
13:32;13:34;"That's me and my kind of like paranoid mentality."
13:34;13:37;"I don't think it really came across that way, but that's kind of what I was thinking."
13:37;13:39;"It's like, oh, the only song you know is A-Punk?"
13:39;13:41;"What, because you saw Step Brothers or something?"
13:41;13:43;"Well, you know what? Here you go, mother[bleep]"
13:43;13:45;"And here's three times."
13:45;13:47;"I'm going to give it to you three times, just so you know."
13:47;13:50;"And if that's all you want from us, well, [bleep] damn it, walk away right now."
13:50;13:52;"But I'll tell you one thing."
13:52;13:54;"You're going to miss out on a great set, young man."
13:54;13:56;"That was kind of my thinking."
13:56;13:58;"And honestly, it was a difficult way to open the show,"
13:58;14:00;"because actually it helped me personally, because it felt like--"
14:00;14:02;"it was kind of like a warm-up."
14:02;14:05;"My favorite comment that I saw was like on Instagram or something."
14:05;14:08;"One of the fans who's at the show said, ""It's so weird. I was there."
14:08;14:11;"And I didn't realize they played it three times."""
14:11;14:13;"And I was kind of like--on stage, I was kind of like, ""I know what you mean."""
14:13;14:15;"It felt so weird playing it three times."
14:15;14:17;"It's such a short song, too."
14:17;14:20;"It ends with the-- [singing]"
14:20;14:24;"And then pause, and then-- [singing]"
14:24;14:26;"Also, it's such a short song."
14:26;14:28;"I wonder why we didn't do that sooner."
14:28;14:30;"How many pauses did you have between songs, versions?"
14:30;14:33;"I don't know. No more than 15, 20 seconds."
14:33;14:36;"Okay, so it wasn't just a count-off, like-- [singing]"
14:36;14:39;"No. [singing]"
14:39;14:43;"I heard some people thought the live stream was broken."
14:43;14:46;"I also feel like it's a fun thing, too, to start off a set."
14:46;14:49;"If you can't get down with that, even more reason to go watch The Weeknd."
14:49;14:53;"It's almost reminiscent of a fish kind of thing, too,"
14:53;14:57;"like a funny stunt that you pull out of your hat once in a while."
14:57;14:59;"Like maybe once every 18 months."
14:59;15:03;"They're like, ""Dude, they played A-Punk six times in a row."""

16:12;16:14;"- So Dick Pix has played about, or Richard Pictures"
16:14;16:16;"has played about a third of those."
16:16;16:18;"- A significant percentage."
16:18;16:20;"But you know one thing that I wanted to say on this episode,"
16:20;16:22;"this is apropos of nothing,"
16:22;16:24;"but have you guys ever played West LA Fadeaway?"
16:24;16:25;"- No."
16:25;16:26;"- Do you like that song?"
16:26;16:27;"- Yeah, it's okay, not one of my favorites,"
16:27;16:29;"but it's been in the conversation."
16:29;16:30;"- It's been kicked around?"
16:30;16:31;"- Yeah."

16:32;16:33;"- Yeah, I've always kind of liked it."
16:33;16:34;"- Throw it on."
16:34;16:37;"- I like that kind of funky side of the Grateful Dead."
16:37;16:39;"But one thing I was thinking about,"
16:39;16:41;"'cause you know I'm a big fan of Robert Hunter,"
16:41;16:44;"I'm a lyrics guy, West LA Fadeaway has one of the most"
16:44;16:48;"random, but also great Grateful Dead lyrics."
16:48;16:53;"Verse two, got a job moving items for the mob."
16:53;16:54;"(laughs)"

17:09;17:11;"""Oh, they got a writer listening to Springsteen."""
17:11;17:15;"- I just like, also love like the lyrical world of the dead."
17:15;17:19;"It includes quite a bit, you know, the American West,"
17:19;17:23;"kind of mysticism, old timey American history."
17:23;17:24;"But like, I just love--"
17:24;17:25;"- Love of death."
17:25;17:26;"- But the mob."
17:26;17:30;"And also, moving items for the mob."
17:30;17:33;"Even, there's something about him like saying items."
17:33;17:34;"Let me skip to that part."
17:34;17:36;"(rewinding)"
17:36;17:41;"- Oh, that's a rough tone."
17:41;17:44;"- There's some better live versions."
17:44;17:45;"- Is this a studio version?"
17:45;17:46;"- Yeah."
17:46;17:47;"- I wonder what the dead's relationship"
17:47;17:50;"with West LA was specifically."
17:50;17:51;"- Yeah, I wonder if Hunter just like,"
17:51;17:53;"bust that out of nowhere."

18:19;18:21;"like a late 80s Jerry actually being"

18:45;18:46;"- Yeah."
18:46;18:48;"- Oh, Nick showed me a website that thinks"
18:48;18:52;"that West LA Fadeaway was inspired by John Belushi's death."
18:52;18:53;"- Huh, okay."
18:53;18:55;"- Belushi joined the dead on stage at least once,"
18:55;18:59;"singing backup during an encore at a 1980 New Jersey gig."

19:29;19:31;"I was hanging out with a little crew"
19:31;19:33;"that Ariel and Danielle were out there."
19:33;19:34;"- Oh cool."
19:34;19:36;"- That was something fun we did in Japan."
19:36;19:37;"Perhaps the wrong territory to choose it,"
19:37;19:40;"but we played Boyz R Back in town"
19:40;19:41;"and Danielle was on vocals."
19:41;19:44;"- I saw this on the set list and I'm very intrigued."
19:44;19:46;"- I couldn't tell how big Thin Lizzy was in Japan."
19:46;19:47;"It didn't get a crazy reaction."
19:47;19:50;"Then we played it at the little club show in Chicago"
19:50;19:52;"and it was like, it went off."
19:52;19:53;"- Really?"
19:53;19:54;"- Just like people yelling the words."
19:54;19:56;"- Is it just like a straight up version?"

20:12;20:14;"But anyway, during this trip to Japan,"
20:14;20:17;"you know, we had like basically a full week off in Tokyo."
20:17;20:19;"So I was like half comatose from being so jet lagged"
20:19;20:21;"and it was like this crazy heat wave."
20:21;20:23;"I guess kind of like globally."
20:23;20:24;"But in Japan it was super hot."
20:24;20:26;"- Oh, global heat wave is--"
20:26;20:27;"- It was, yeah, it's brutal."
20:27;20:28;"- Dark term."
20:28;20:30;"- But so I spent a lot of time walking around"
20:30;20:32;"with Ariel and Danielle and our friend Anya."
20:32;20:34;"And you know, in Tokyo it's like an amazing city"
20:34;20:35;"just to walk around."
20:35;20:36;"You could literally just walk in and out"
20:36;20:39;"of like vibey stores every day."
20:39;20:40;"CT told me, and I went to it,"
20:40;20:42;"that there's a store called Ripple"
20:42;20:43;"that sold dead shirts."
20:43;20:44;"- Wow."
20:44;20:46;"- So a lot of vintage dead shirts."
20:46;20:47;"- Like exclusively?"
20:47;20:48;"That's what they sell?"
20:48;20:50;"- No, it kind of just veers hippie."
20:50;20:52;"But it's clearly named after the dead song."
20:52;20:53;"But so we'd be walking around"
20:53;20:55;"and you drink a lot of coffee."
20:55;20:56;"It's a real coffee culture."
20:56;20:57;"- Okay."
20:57;20:59;"- And it's sometimes how it dawned on me"
20:59;21:01;"that I hate cold brew."
21:01;21:02;"And I was talking about it with them"
21:02;21:03;"and I was kind of like,"
21:03;21:06;"why is everything cold brew now?"
21:06;21:07;"I just had so many questions about it."
21:07;21:08;"- Okay, grandpa."
21:08;21:10;"- I know, this is like some pretty grandpa (beep)"
21:10;21:12;"And then I get back to LA."
21:12;21:14;"I'm just walking around West LA fade away style."
21:14;21:16;"- Land of cold brew."
21:16;21:18;"- I walk past a, I don't think it was an Exxon,"
21:18;21:19;"but it was some kind of gas station."
21:19;21:21;"There's a big sign, try our cold brew."
21:21;21:22;"- Dude, 7-Eleven."
21:22;21:23;"- Oh, 7-Eleven has cold brew now?"
21:23;21:24;"- Yeah, I noticed this."
21:24;21:25;"- No, but this was a gas station that I was at."
21:25;21:28;"- After you texted me about the cold brew kick you're on,"
21:28;21:30;"I noticed that like on a billboard."
21:30;21:33;"Well, 7-Eleven, or maybe it was like an AM, PM or something."
21:33;21:36;"- They might, a lot of these places have cold brew now."
21:36;21:36;"- Try our cold brew."
21:36;21:38;"- Everybody's obsessed with cold brew."
21:38;21:39;"And then I was just talking with everybody"
21:39;21:40;"and I was like saying to my friends,"
21:40;21:41;"do you guys like cold brew?"
21:41;21:44;"I think it's worse than regular iced coffee."
21:44;21:46;"And then also you start to find coffee places"
21:46;21:48;"where you ask for an iced coffee"
21:48;21:49;"and they give you a cold brew."
21:49;21:53;"And then I saw like a goofy Instagram post."
21:53;21:55;"It was some like overheard type,"
21:55;21:57;"you know these accounts that do funny things, overheard."
21:57;21:59;"And one of them was at a coffee shop."
21:59;22:03;"Somebody said, it was a patron saying to the barista,"
22:03;22:05;"can I have a cold brew?"
22:05;22:07;"And then the barista says, sorry, we're out of cold brew."
22:07;22:08;"Is iced coffee okay?"
22:08;22:10;"And the person says, yeah, honestly,"
22:10;22:11;"I don't know the difference."
22:11;22:14;"Then about a week ago, I emailed the crisis crew"
22:14;22:16;"and I said, guys, we gotta do a cold brew episode."
22:16;22:18;"We're on board with this."
22:18;22:21;"So I said, find us some great cold brew guests"
22:21;22:22;"that we can talk to."
22:22;22:26;"And the first person we're gonna talk to is Tim Carman,"
22:26;22:27;"who's a food reporter at the Washington Post"
22:27;22:29;"where he's worked since 2010."
22:29;22:31;"He was the winner of the James Beard Award in 2011"
22:31;22:34;"for food related columns and commentary."
22:34;22:36;"Okay, so it says here he's a food reporter."
22:36;22:38;"It doesn't say that he covers beverages,"
22:38;22:40;"but we'll see if he has anything to say about this."
22:40;22:43;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
22:43;22:46;"(phone ringing)"
22:47;22:48;"- This is Tim."
22:48;22:49;"- Hey Tim, what's up?"
22:49;22:51;"This is Ezra and Jake from Time Crisis."
22:51;22:53;"- Hey, how are you?"
22:53;22:54;"- Not bad, excited to talk to you."
22:54;22:56;"So you're a food reporter at the Washington Post."
22:56;22:57;"- That's correct."
22:57;22:59;"- But you also cover beverages."
22:59;23:02;"- I have made myself something of the coffee experts"
23:02;23:04;"among the food writers at the paper."
23:04;23:07;"- And also in your own life, are you like a coffee fanatic?"
23:07;23:08;"- Oh, big time."
23:08;23:12;"I have got more gadgets than you can imagine."
23:12;23:14;"- So you're making a lot of coffee at home."
23:14;23:17;"- I make coffee every day, usually hot,"
23:17;23:22;"but I've certainly done my fair share of cold brew."
23:22;23:23;"- Well, that's exactly what we wanna talk about."
23:23;23:26;"And we could use a little bit of context"
23:26;23:29;"from somebody who not only is a coffee drinker,"
23:29;23:32;"but also a reporter and somebody who studies this stuff."
23:32;23:33;"I just had this realization"
23:33;23:36;"that cold brew was suddenly everywhere."
23:36;23:38;"I also realized that as it becomes more ubiquitous,"
23:38;23:40;"people kind of will use cold brew"
23:40;23:42;"and iced coffee interchangeably,"
23:42;23:45;"which leads to a lot of miscommunications,"
23:45;23:47;"tragedies at the coffee shop."
23:47;23:48;"- That's rubbing you the wrong way."
23:48;23:49;"- It is rubbing me the wrong way."
23:49;23:51;"So I guess if you don't mind, Tim,"
23:51;23:53;"I think you're gonna have a lot more perspective"
23:53;23:54;"on this than we do."
23:54;23:56;"What's the cold brew story"
23:56;23:59;"and how did it come to kind of take over the world?"
23:59;24:01;"- Well, I think the first thing to realize"
24:01;24:04;"is that cold brew and iced coffee"
24:04;24:06;"are two different processes."
24:06;24:08;"Iced coffee is very simple."
24:08;24:12;"It's just taking hot brewed coffee and putting it over ice."
24:12;24:15;"Conversely, the cold brew"
24:15;24:20;"is a long steeped room temperature process."
24:20;24:24;"And you can use it, you can do it in a French press,"
24:24;24:26;"which I think a lot of people have already,"
24:26;24:28;"or you can buy one of these contraptions."
24:28;24:32;"One is very popular with coffee shops called a toddy."
24:32;24:35;"And you take a large amount of beans,"
24:35;24:39;"a six to one ratio of water to beans,"
24:39;24:41;"which doesn't sound like a lot,"
24:41;24:45;"but compared to what the ratio is for hot brewed coffee,"
24:45;24:49;"it's a monstrous amount of beans."
24:49;24:52;"And you let that steep for like 12 to 24 hours"
24:52;24:56;"on your counter where it becomes very concentrated liquid."
24:56;25:00;"It'll often be put right in a pitcher"
25:00;25:02;"and put in your refrigerator."
25:02;25:05;"And obviously one of the benefits of that then"
25:05;25:08;"is that you can have coffee available for you"
25:08;25:10;"for like two weeks."
25:10;25:13;"So it has a longer shelf life than fresh brewed coffee."
25:13;25:16;"It's generally considered to be like less acidic."
25:16;25:17;"- That's what drives me crazy, Tim,"
25:17;25:20;"is that most places where I go have cold brew,"
25:20;25:22;"it tastes so sour to me."
25:22;25:23;"- That's unusual."
25:23;25:25;"I don't know where you're getting your cold brew from,"
25:25;25:26;"but I'd be curious."
25:26;25:28;"- I don't wanna name names."
25:28;25:32;"- I think most coffee shops, they go for a blend"
25:32;25:35;"because consistency is key, right?"
25:35;25:38;"People want the same cup of cold brew all year long,"
25:38;25:41;"which is hard to do with a single origin coffee"
25:41;25:44;"because A, they're seasonal and they're only available"
25:44;25:47;"for a few months out of the year."
25:47;25:49;"They'll create a blend of beans"
25:49;25:52;"that typically has a natural sweetness to it."
25:52;25:54;"And that's what appeals, I think,"
25:54;25:56;"to most cold brew drinkers,"
25:56;25:59;"is that you've got a drink that's cold,"
25:59;26:01;"which people like during the summer,"
26:01;26:05;"and then it has lower acidity and it tends to be sweet."
26:05;26:08;"I think those are like three of the main points"
26:08;26:11;"of why cold brew has latched on."
26:11;26:15;"- Seinfeld 2000 here, the Starbucks near my home base"
26:15;26:17;"has cold brew on tap,"
26:17;26:20;"much like you would find a beer on tap at a bar."
26:20;26:25;"Why is it on tap and what goes into that process?"
26:25;26:27;"- I'm assuming this is a cold brew nitro?"
26:27;26:28;"- Yes, I think it is."
26:28;26:30;"- Oh yeah, what's this nitro (beep)"
26:30;26:35;"- Yeah, it's basically just cold brew coffee,"
26:35;26:37;"but it's put on nitro."
26:37;26:41;"And what that does is that it inserts a gas into the coffee."
26:41;26:45;"So it gives it a very creamy flavor to it."
26:45;26:47;"There's obviously no cream in it,"
26:47;26:50;"but just because it's injected with gas,"
26:50;26:52;"kind of infused with gas,"
26:52;26:54;"it gives it this really rounded,"
26:54;26:58;"sweet sort of creamy flavor, which people like."
26:58;27:00;"I don't know about you, but nitro coffee to me"
27:00;27:04;"also just seems to go straight to the bloodstream."
27:04;27:07;"So it's like whatever amount of caffeine"
27:07;27:11;"is in that cold brew, it just immediately makes me jittery."
27:11;27:13;"- But theoretically, nitro aside,"
27:13;27:14;"people sometimes talk about cold brew"
27:14;27:17;"as if it's more hardcore than iced coffee."
27:17;27:20;"Is it necessarily stronger or just depends?"
27:20;27:21;"- It's not stronger."
27:21;27:24;"I mean, it's the same cold brew that you would,"
27:24;27:28;"I mean, I'm assuming most coffee shops are using"
27:28;27:30;"the batch that they make for the cold brew."
27:30;27:32;"They're using the same cold brew."
27:32;27:34;"- Same beans. - Nitro, yeah."
27:34;27:38;"So the only difference is that it's infused with this gas."
27:38;27:42;"And I don't know, to call it more hardcore,"
27:42;27:45;"I think maybe it gives you more of a quicker buzz."
27:45;27:46;"Every time I've drank it,"
27:46;27:49;"I've basically had to stop halfway through"
27:49;27:52;"because I just think, and this is just a personal thing,"
27:52;27:54;"this is not based on any sort of science,"
27:54;27:59;"but it makes me loopy within half the drink."
27:59;28:01;"So I guess in that sense, maybe it is more hardcore."
28:01;28:04;"If you're looking for that caffeine buzz, sure."

28:50;28:54;"rather than go get some artisanal cold brew somewhere,"
28:54;28:58;"I would rather house two tall boys of iced coffee"
28:58;28:59;"from coffee bean."
28:59;29:02;"At the end of the day, I'm gonna be floating on air,"
29:02;29:03;"even if it took me a little bit longer,"
29:03;29:05;"but I don't know, there's something about"
29:05;29:07;"just like a big iced coffee,"
29:07;29:08;"it just goes down easier for me."
29:08;29:10;"And that's what's so confusing to me,"
29:10;29:13;"this idea of cold brew actually having a smoother flavor"
29:13;29:14;"or something, maybe I'm just weird."
29:14;29:15;"But also, I don't know, Tim,"
29:15;29:17;"if this is a full East Coast thing,"
29:17;29:20;"definitely I remember in New York, when I was a teenager,"
29:20;29:23;"there was a thing that I would hear family members"
29:23;29:26;"and like my parents' friends say a lot, which was that,"
29:26;29:27;"and this is a little bit before"
29:27;29:29;"that the whole third wave coffee boom,"
29:29;29:30;"but they would always say,"
29:30;29:31;"a lot of people go buy their fancy beans"
29:31;29:34;"at a little artisanal bean store,"
29:34;29:36;"but you know where it really has great coffee?"
29:36;29:37;"Dunkin' Donuts."
29:37;29:40;"Do you remember this, Tim, do they have that down in DC?"
29:40;29:44;"- Oh yeah, they used to spin that BS about Dunkin' Donuts,"
29:44;29:47;"and even earlier, my father used to say that"
29:47;29:49;"McDonald's had the best coffee."
29:49;29:52;"- That's the dark ages."
29:52;29:52;"- Yeah."
29:52;29:53;"- They say that in Canada a lot."
29:53;29:54;"- Well, you have to understand,"
29:54;29:56;"my dad also drank freeze-dried coffee,"
29:56;29:59;"so his bar was very low."
29:59;30:00;"- It was a step up."
30:00;30:03;"- I can't even imagine the average coffee drinker"
30:03;30:07;"circa 1975, what they were drinking."
30:07;30:08;"- Oh, it was terrible."
30:08;30:10;"Commodity-based coffee beans."
30:10;30:11;"- Inedible. - Over-roasted."
30:11;30:14;"You know, I started drinking coffee in the 80s,"
30:14;30:19;"so I was a child of the terrible bean era."
30:19;30:23;"Starbucks maybe had started on the West Coast,"
30:23;30:27;"but certainly had made it to the Midwest where I grew up."
30:27;30:27;"- Where'd you grow up?"
30:27;30:29;"- I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska."
30:29;30:32;"- So have you ever been in Omaha now as an adult,"
30:32;30:35;"and you're in some cool, kind of like,"
30:35;30:39;"hipster-fied neighborhood that has New York-style lofts,"
30:39;30:41;"and there's a coffee shop, and you go in and check it out,"
30:41;30:44;"and drink a Nitro cold brew or something?"
30:44;30:47;"That's exactly the type of coffee that wasn't available"
30:47;30:49;"in the 80s in a place like Omaha."
30:49;30:51;"Are you like, I'm really glad that the kids of today"
30:51;30:54;"in Omaha can drink the exact same stuff"
30:54;30:56;"that people in New York or LA are drinking,"
30:56;30:58;"or is it bittersweet?"
30:58;31:01;"Do we lose something when things like Nitro cold brew"
31:01;31:03;"are in every city in America?"
31:03;31:09;"- No, I have no nostalgia for the old ways of coffee-making,"
31:09;31:11;"and the way it was sold."
31:11;31:13;"It just wasn't good coffee."
31:13;31:16;"I think we still battle that perception"
31:16;31:20;"of third-wave coffee being sort of snobbish."
31:20;31:21;"- Right."
31:21;31:23;"- But I look at it a different way."
31:23;31:25;"I like to look at it a different way."
31:25;31:29;"It's like, people used to think that Miller High Life"
31:29;31:33;"or Bud Light was good beer,"
31:33;31:35;"and then the craft beer movement came along,"
31:35;31:39;"and you realized there was this whole broad spectrum"
31:39;31:43;"of beers available, really delicious beers,"
31:43;31:45;"many different flavors, different styles,"
31:45;31:48;"different bodies, different hop counts,"
31:48;31:50;"and coffee is much the same way."
31:50;31:52;"Now, whether or not everyone can afford it,"
31:52;31:53;"that's another thing."
31:53;31:55;"I mean, that's a whole other issue about,"
31:55;31:58;"can people really afford a good cup of coffee,"
31:58;31:59;"and should you be a snob about people"
31:59;32:02;"that still drink Folgers?"
32:02;32:05;"Well, no, everyone tweets their own."
32:05;32:08;"- But for you personally, you're never on a road trip,"
32:08;32:09;"and you pull into a little diner,"
32:09;32:11;"like a Twin Peaks-style diner,"
32:11;32:14;"you get a slice of pie and just a cup of black coffee,"
32:14;32:16;"whatever garbage they're making back there,"
32:16;32:18;"and you sip, and you're like,"
32:18;32:20;"you know what, there's something nice about this, too."
32:20;32:22;"- You know, I will sometimes do that,"
32:22;32:24;"but it's mostly just out of desperation,"
32:24;32:26;"'cause I want something hot and caffeinated,"
32:26;32:30;"and I can't find something better that's closer."
32:30;32:33;"'Cause I really, like, I was in San Francisco"
32:33;32:37;"and Los Angeles last week, and I stayed at a hotel"
32:37;32:40;"that had one of those little brewers in there,"
32:40;32:43;"and it's truly, I mean, it's a terrible cup of coffee,"
32:43;32:47;"but I was tired, I had to get up early for interviews,"
32:47;32:50;"and I needed some caffeine, so I did it."
32:50;32:53;"But it was like, it was like a drug."
32:53;32:56;"It makes you realize that it's partly"
32:56;32:58;"after year after the high."
32:58;32:58;"- That's how I feel."
32:58;33:01;"I wanna have one of those little brewers in my bedroom."
33:01;33:03;"'Cause like, when I'm at a hotel, I like that."
33:03;33:05;"I like that I can have a little,"
33:05;33:06;"Jake's shaking his head no,"
33:06;33:09;"but I like that I can have a little (beep)"
33:09;33:12;"pod coffee, it's like the primer,"
33:12;33:13;"then I jump in the shower,"
33:13;33:16;"then 20 to 30 minutes later, maybe I hit the street,"
33:16;33:18;"and I get something more artisanal."
33:18;33:20;"But I like to have that base high."
33:20;33:22;"- Sure, yeah, no, I completely get it."
33:22;33:25;"- But so, okay, so all things considered,"
33:25;33:27;"you think that the rise and spread of cold brew"
33:27;33:31;"is a good thing, more options, different kinds of flavors,"
33:31;33:34;"you're happy that you see it popping up everywhere now?"
33:34;33:36;"- Well, not just cold brew, I mean, I know you're"
33:36;33:39;"sort of focused on cold brew, and I'm glad"
33:39;33:43;"that cold brew's there, 'cause I do think that people,"
33:43;33:45;"I think it's like a gateway into the third wave."
33:45;33:49;"I think one of the secrets of third wave coffee shops"
33:49;33:52;"is many of them serve cold brew,"
33:52;33:54;"but not many of them really like it,"
33:54;33:56;"'cause it doesn't give you the full range of flavors."
33:56;33:58;"But I think that gets you into that shop,"
33:58;34:03;"and introduces you to different coffee beans, perhaps,"
34:03;34:06;"depending on what the coffee shop is using for its cold brew,"
34:06;34:10;"and then maybe, you know, if you're open to suggestion"
34:10;34:12;"from the barista, you'll move into something"
34:12;34:14;"that's even more interesting and more complex."
34:14;34:17;"So I think it's good, I'm all for it."
34:17;34:19;"- Okay, well, thanks a lot, Tim, great talking to you."
34:19;34:20;"Appreciate it. - Yeah, it was fun."
34:20;34:21;"Thanks, guys. - All right,"
34:21;34:22;"have a good one, man."

35:43;35:44;"- Jake, do you drink cold brew?"
35:44;35:45;"- Yeah."
35:45;35:46;"- You'll go into a place"
35:46;35:48;"and you'll specifically ask for a cold brew."
35:48;35:49;"You drink a black cold brew?"
35:49;35:53;"- I ask for iced coffee, but I go to fancy places."
35:53;35:55;"- You ask for an iced coffee and they give you a cold brew?"
35:55;35:56;"- Yeah, that's standard."
35:56;36:00;"If you're going to a bougie coffee place in LA"
36:00;36:02;"and you ask for iced coffee, that's what it's gonna be."
36:02;36:04;"- See, would you rather have a cold,"
36:04;36:05;"like a artisanal coffee cold brew"
36:05;36:09;"than just like a tall boy iced coffee from Dunkin' Donuts?"
36:09;36:10;"- Yeah, I'm not gonna drink that."
36:10;36:12;"I'll make iced coffee at home"
36:12;36:15;"'cause I'll make a strong pot to begin with."
36:15;36:15;"- Yeah."
36:15;36:17;"- I'll let it cool to room temp"
36:17;36:19;"and then I'll add four or five ice cubes into the mug."
36:19;36:20;"- What, does that home iced coffee"
36:20;36:21;"taste better than a cold brew?"
36:21;36:24;"- No, it actually doesn't."
36:24;36:27;"And actually this came across my desk yesterday"
36:27;36:28;"'cause I was at home working"
36:28;36:31;"and I had the home brewed mug of coffee"
36:31;36:34;"that had cooled down and I added ice coffee,"
36:34;36:36;"or ice cubes, and I was just gonna sip on that."
36:36;36:39;"Then Hannah came home with a half drunk cold brew."
36:39;36:41;"- So you had accidental taste test."
36:41;36:43;"- And the cold brew was so much richer."
36:43;36:44;"- Richer."
36:44;36:45;"- So much better."
36:45;36:48;"I just dumped the homemade mug down the drain immediately."
36:48;36:50;"- Maybe I just got trash taste at the end of the day."
36:50;36:51;"What do you drink, Seinfeld?"
36:51;36:52;"- Well, I drink everything,"
36:52;36:55;"but I was thinking about,"
36:55;36:56;"actually I was in Whole Foods"
36:56;36:58;"and I saw a can of cold brew."
36:58;36:59;"- Really, you go to Whole Foods?"
36:59;37:01;"- Yeah, there's one near my home base."
37:01;37:02;"(laughing)"
37:02;37:05;"And I came across this can"
37:05;37:08;"and it was Ethiopian single estate cold brew,"
37:08;37:09;"really nicely designed can."
37:09;37:12;"And I thought, this is gonna be a treat tomorrow morning."
37:12;37:13;"- Yeah."
37:13;37:17;"- And I cracked it open at 7.45, whatever."
37:17;37:18;"And it was the most disgusting thing"
37:18;37:20;"I have ever drank in my life."
37:20;37:22;"- 'Cause it was that sour diesel cold brew."
37:22;37:23;"- It was exact--"
37:23;37:24;"- It was sour diesel, hold on."
37:24;37:25;"- Sour diesel is a very accurate way to describe it, yeah."
37:25;37:27;"- Now, were you drinking it out of the can?"
37:27;37:28;"- Straight out the can."
37:28;37:29;"Like a beer."
37:29;37:30;"- Why don't you pour that over some ice"
37:30;37:31;"into a pint glass?"
37:31;37:32;"- 'Cause it was cold, it was like I had in the fridge,"
37:32;37:33;"it was already cold."
37:33;37:35;"- Here's the thing, I think cold brew"
37:35;37:37;"is sort of like, it's like whiskey."
37:37;37:38;"If you're gonna pour it over,"
37:38;37:40;"you have to pour it over ice,"
37:40;37:42;"let it sit for a minute or two."
37:42;37:44;"It needs to be a little bit diluted."
37:44;37:47;"I would never wanna just drink cold brew with no ice."
37:47;37:49;"- But it's already cold."
37:49;37:50;"- Yeah, but you need the ice."
37:50;37:51;"It just--"
37:51;37:52;"- You need that ice."
37:52;37:53;"- It dilutes it, it's a texture thing."
37:53;37:54;"- Yeah, I'm talking about that."
37:54;37:56;"- Also, coffee out of a can seems like a weird sensory--"
37:56;37:58;"- It did have the aluminum kind of,"
37:58;37:59;"that's tangive, like, yeah."
37:59;38:01;"- You gotta get out of the can, man."
38:01;38:04;"Also, first cup of the day, gotta be hot."
38:04;38:04;"- Good call."
38:04;38:05;"- Wait, actually, this reminds me,"
38:05;38:08;"before we get to talk to some more cold brew experts,"
38:08;38:09;"remember a few episodes ago,"
38:09;38:11;"we talked about Canadians double dipping"
38:11;38:13;"at Tim Hortons and Starbucks?"
38:13;38:14;"- Yep."
38:14;38:15;"- And we're like, is it cool to roll into Tim Hortons"
38:15;38:17;"with a Starbucks coffee and be like,"
38:17;38:19;"let me get a maple glazed donut?"
38:19;38:20;"We actually got some good emails about it."
38:20;38:21;"- A lot of response to that, yeah."
38:21;38:22;"- We did get a lot."
38:22;38:24;"Here's a good one from Heather McDonald."
38:24;38:26;"Hey, Crisis Crew, big fan of the show,"
38:26;38:27;"emailing in from Toronto."
38:27;38:29;"I'm currently listening to episode 72,"
38:29;38:30;"late I know."
38:30;38:33;"Well, time crisis is just nothing."
38:33;38:34;"- It's evergreen."
38:34;38:36;"- If not, not timely."
38:36;38:37;"I needed to speak up about the concept"
38:37;38:40;"of Canadians double dipping in Starbucks and Tim Hortons,"
38:40;38:43;"and I will say, this is 100% a real thing."
38:43;38:44;"When I was in high school,"
38:44;38:46;"the local Tim Hortons was directly behind a Starbucks,"
38:46;38:49;"and we'd often send someone into Tim's"
38:49;38:52;"for a good muffin/sandwich/donut,"
38:52;38:54;"and someone else into Starbucks to get our coffee"
38:54;38:56;"to avoid being exposed."
38:56;38:57;"Being alone was a nightmare,"
38:57;38:59;"as the employees would always try"
38:59;39:01;"to make an awkward joke about buying"
39:01;39:02;"from both establishments."
39:02;39:03;"Was it uncomfortable?"
39:03;39:04;"Yes."
39:04;39:05;"Was it necessary?"
39:05;39:06;"Also yes."
39:06;39:07;"Anyways, love your work out there,"
39:07;39:09;"and just thought I'd give my two cents on the subject."
39:09;39:10;"All the best, Heather."
39:10;39:12;"- Starbucks has muffins too."
39:12;39:13;"- But I guess they're not as good."
39:13;39:15;"Well, let's see, you're actually Canadian, Seinfeld."
39:15;39:17;"What do you think, she's describing being alone,"
39:17;39:21;"and you roll in with your frappuccino from Starbucks,"
39:21;39:23;"and then you go to the Tim Hortons employee,"
39:23;39:25;"and then she said they would make an awkward joke."
39:25;39:26;"What would that joke be?"
39:26;39:28;"- Oh, hmm."
39:28;39:30;"They'd say, ""Oh, oh, oh, you're a traitor."
39:30;39:32;"""Oh, I see,"" you know, something like that."
39:32;39:35;"""Oh, you're betraying us,"" something like that maybe?"
39:35;39:37;"- And us is Tim Hortons, or is it Canada?"
39:37;39:40;"(all laughing)"
39:40;39:42;"- I think in that case, it would be Tim Hortons,"
39:42;39:44;"but it's very poetic."
39:44;39:46;"- You know how in some countries"
39:46;39:47;"where people are very polite,"
39:47;39:51;"the joke is that there's simmering rage beneath the surface?"
39:51;39:52;"Is that true of Canada?"
39:52;39:55;"Or Canada always joked, ""Me is legitimately nicer."""
39:55;39:57;"- Yeah, I mean, I don't wanna generalize,"
39:57;39:59;"but I think you would find some of that for sure."
39:59;40:01;"- Oh, looks like we got a traitor here, ha ha."
40:01;40:03;"- That, yeah, exactly."
40:03;40:06;"- We oughta take you around the back and execute ya."
40:06;40:07;"- The first time-- - Oh, no, I'm sorry."
40:07;40:08;"I'm doing it like Minnesota."
40:08;40:10;"What are you doing? - Whoa, we're gonna take ya."
40:10;40:11;"No, I can't, I don't know."
40:11;40:13;"- Oh, looks like we got a traitor here, ha ha."
40:13;40:16;"Oughta take you in the back, blindfold ya,"
40:16;40:19;"shoot you in the back of the head."
40:19;40:21;"That's not very Canadian."
40:21;40:21;"A Canadian would never say that."
40:21;40:24;"- The detail is kinda making it a little dark."
40:24;40:27;"- And then just here's another one from Darcy Belmore."
40:27;40:29;"Hey, Crisis Crew, just finished listening"
40:29;40:30;"to this week's episode."
40:30;40:32;"As a Canadian, I definitely get food at Tim Hortons"
40:32;40:34;"and coffee at Starbucks, at least while on campus."
40:34;40:37;"I go to Tim's first, grab an egg, B-E-L-T."
40:37;40:39;"Oh, 'cause of the egg."
40:39;40:40;"It's like ATM machine. - Belt?"
40:40;40:41;"That sounds good."
40:41;40:42;"- I go to Tim's first, she's--"
40:42;40:43;"Grab a belt. - Get that belt."
40:43;40:46;"- A belt, is that not well known in Canada?"
40:46;40:48;"- This is the first time I've heard of a belt."
40:48;40:51;"- I'm guessing it's a bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato."
40:51;40:54;"I go get a belt on a 12 grain bagel"
40:54;40:56;"and then walk across campus to Starbucks."
40:56;40:57;"- Damn, that's a hell of a breakfast."
40:57;40:59;"- Tim's coffee is the pits."
40:59;41:01;"Darcy, wait, is that a thing?"
41:01;41:03;"Is Tim's coffee bad?"
41:03;41:06;"- Tim's coffee falls into the same description of like,"
41:06;41:08;"oh, the real coffee's at Dunkin',"
41:08;41:10;"oh, the good coffee's at McDonald's."
41:10;41:11;"Like, it's one of those."
41:11;41:13;"- We got one more email from a dude."
41:13;41:16;"I won't read the whole thing, but he's from Buffalo,"
41:16;41:17;"which for those unfamiliar with the city,"
41:17;41:18;"it lays on the US-Canada border"
41:18;41:20;"and has quite a Canadian feel to it."
41:20;41:22;"The winters are long, the people are friendly,"
41:22;41:25;"and ponds are filled with children playing hockey"
41:25;41:26;"in the chillier months of the year."
41:26;41:27;"But most important of all,"
41:27;41:29;"it is the rare American exception"
41:29;41:32;"where most individuals prefer Tim Hortons to Starbucks."
41:32;41:33;"Now that's interesting."
41:33;41:34;"Just this past week,"
41:34;41:37;"I relocated to the Charleston, South Carolina area."
41:37;41:38;"Buffalo to Charleston."
41:38;41:39;"- That's a hell of a move."
41:40;41:41;"There's gonna be some culture shock."
41:41;41:43;"And I'm finding it difficult to part ways"
41:43;41:45;"with my former morning routine"
41:45;41:47;"of grabbing a coffee from Tim Hortons"
41:47;41:50;"and the occasional breakfast sandwich from Starbucks."
41:50;41:51;"- Well, reverse."
41:51;41:52;"- Yeah, personally, I find Starbucks"
41:52;41:54;"to have a delicious array of breakfast sandwiches."
41:54;41:55;"- He's not wrong there."
41:55;41:56;"- They're pretty good."
41:56;41:58;"The interesting part of the story is that back home,"
41:58;42:00;"I often felt embarrassed or ashamed"
42:00;42:03;"to bring my Starbucks wrappers and bags into work"
42:03;42:04;"or to a friend's house."
42:04;42:05;"Wow."
42:05;42:06;"- Shame."
42:06;42:08;"- Buffalo, I guess, really is part of Canada."
42:08;42:10;"- I was gonna say, with all due respect,"
42:10;42:11;"like this guy's disqualified."
42:11;42:15;"I mean, it's not, technically it's not, so."
42:15;42:16;"- Or so he felt ashamed"
42:16;42:18;"bringing his Starbucks wrappers and bags into work"
42:18;42:19;"or to a friend's house,"
42:19;42:20;"as many in the area felt that Starbucks"
42:20;42:23;"was a little bougie for their liking."
42:23;42:25;"It might be bougie, but it's American, my friend."
42:25;42:27;"Tim Hortons, you're aiding and abetting."
42:27;42:31;"- It's so ubiquitous, though, I don't know."
42:31;42:31;"- Wow."
42:31;42:33;"- Anyways, I figured you folks would be interested"
42:33;42:34;"to know that there are several pockets"
42:34;42:36;"of blue-collar America that are ride or die for Tim Hortons."
42:36;42:38;"I get that, but that's interesting."
42:38;42:40;"- The people in Buffalo who think Starbucks is bougie,"
42:40;42:43;"are they hitting the gas station coffee?"
42:43;42:45;"- Oh, I guess, and maybe they're hitting Tim Hortons."
42:45;42:46;"- Scooping it out the river."
42:46;42:47;"- No, that's a lateral move"
42:47;42:49;"in terms of class distinctions."
42:49;42:52;"- No, no, no, I think, well, if I'm reading the email correctly."
42:52;42:54;"- No, it's like a multinational chain."
42:54;42:57;"- No, I'm picturing Dan going into work,"
42:57;43:01;"holding his spinach and feta breakfast sandwich"
43:01;43:06;"from Starbucks, and there's just more like a Joe Schmo"
43:06;43:08;"drinking Tim Hortons coffee, who's like--"
43:08;43:09;"- Egg and cheese."
43:09;43:11;"- Oh, welcome to work, your majesty."
43:11;43:13;"(laughing)"
43:13;43:16;"Let me get a number crunch."
43:16;43:18;"How much does just a black coffee cost at Tim Hortons?"
43:18;43:19;"- Well, what size are we talking?"
43:19;43:21;"- Gotta cross-reference the exchange rate."
43:21;43:25;"- For a tall, it's 160, grande is 180,"
43:25;43:28;"and then your venti is $2."
43:28;43:29;"- That's at Tim Hortons."
43:29;43:30;"- That's at Tim Hortons."
43:30;43:31;"- Wait, they called venti at Tim Hortons?"
43:31;43:32;"- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you meant Starbucks."
43:32;43:34;"I was converting the names, okay."
43:34;43:36;"- Oh, so Starbucks, you can get a black coffee"
43:36;43:37;"for under two bucks?"
43:37;43:38;"- No way, no, no, no, no, no, I messed up."
43:38;43:40;"- Oh, I bet the small-"
43:40;43:43;"I bet the small-coffeed Starbucks is $1.85."
43:44;43:46;"- This show rules, guys."
43:46;43:49;"(laughing)"
43:49;43:50;"- We really need a video component here"
43:50;43:52;"to complete the show."
43:52;43:54;"(laughing)"
43:54;43:56;"- This week's TimeGrizz episode included"
43:56;44:00;"a very shallow analysis of one line"

45:36;45:39;"I think as I get older, though,"
45:39;45:41;"so much of my life has been about"

45:44;45:46;"getting out of Jersey, going to Columbia,"
45:46;45:49;"being in a band, traveling the world."
45:49;45:51;"- But not just a band."
45:51;45:52;"- A preppy band."
45:52;45:54;"- A band that styled itself."

46:00;46:02;"- Exactly. - But with your coffee."
46:02;46:04;"- I think that's the thing, is that as I've gotten older--"
46:04;46:06;"- Back to your roots. - And I have this feeling,"
46:06;46:08;"a little bit, of having seen it all."

47:22;47:23;"It's communal."
47:23;47:25;"When you drink the Office Java,"
47:25;47:27;"you're saying with your taste buds"
47:27;47:28;"that we're in this together."
47:28;47:31;"When you leave the office to go get Starbucks,"
47:31;47:33;"yeah, you might think you're supporting a local business,"
47:33;47:34;"but you're not."
47:34;47:35;"- No, but you're leaving the office"
47:35;47:37;"to get out of the office."
47:37;47:38;"- What's wrong with the office?"
47:38;47:39;"- It's work."
47:39;47:41;"- It's fun to go make a coffee run."
47:41;47:43;"- But the Office Java's in the break room."
47:43;47:45;"But the Office Java's in the break room."
47:45;47:48;"That's a place where you can debate the news of the day."
47:48;47:49;"- No, man."
47:49;47:50;"- Sometimes with that Office Java--"
47:50;47:52;"- I got more off experience than you guys do,"
47:52;47:53;"or at least Ezra does."
47:53;47:54;"(laughing)"
47:54;47:57;"It's all about who's making the run."
47:57;47:58;"- Right."
47:58;47:59;"- What do you want?"
47:59;48:01;"- And also, you don't wanna be like,"
48:01;48:02;"sometimes you don't wanna run into the,"
48:02;48:04;"there's somebody you don't wanna run into"
48:04;48:05;"by the coffee machine."
48:05;48:08;"- Back in my day, you're damn right you might run"
48:08;48:09;"into somebody that you didn't wanna see,"
48:09;48:12;"but you know what, we hashed it out like grownups."
48:12;48:15;"We weren't staring at our phones, walking into walls."
48:15;48:18;"Yeah, you might see somebody you hate"
48:18;48:20;"pouring themselves a cup of Office Java."
48:20;48:22;"And you know what?"
48:22;48:23;"You'd have to get into it right there."
48:23;48:26;"- Talk about last night's episode of LA Law."
48:26;48:29;"(laughing)"
48:29;48:31;"- That's right, but that's when people talk to each other."
48:31;48:33;"You didn't have this polarization."
48:33;48:35;"I'd see some schmuck who voted for Reagan"
48:35;48:38;"by the Office Joe, we get into it, Office Java."
48:38;48:41;"We're gonna talk to, how do you think you say his name?"
48:41;48:44;"- Brent Wilsinski?"
48:44;48:45;"- Wilsinski."
48:45;48:46;"- Wilsinski, something like that?"
48:46;48:48;"- We'll ask him how to pronounce his last name."
48:48;48:50;"But he's the head brewer and guru of cold brew"
48:50;48:51;"at Stumptown Coffee."
48:51;48:53;"Now Stumptown, Jake--"
48:53;48:53;"- Oh, I'm familiar."
48:53;48:55;"- You're probably familiar, started in Portland, Oregon."
48:55;49:00;"- I did an exhibition there in 2000, their first store."
49:00;49:01;"- At Stumptown?"
49:01;49:02;"- Yeah, it was their only location."
49:02;49:05;"- And they offered to pay you in stock options"
49:05;49:08;"or free beans."
49:08;49:12;"- I got the opportunity to hang my art in their coffee shop."
49:12;49:12;"- And sell it."
49:12;49:15;"- Oh yeah, it's like I sold a few pieces."
49:15;49:15;"- Okay."
49:15;49:17;"- Was Brent part of this?"
49:17;49:18;"- No, I have no idea."
49:18;49:20;"- Well, he's the head brewer, he wasn't one of the founders,"
49:20;49:21;"or Dwayne Sorenson."
49:21;49:24;"- I have no idea if Brent was in the mix back in 2000."
49:24;49:25;"I think this was 2000 I did this."
49:25;49:28;"- But Stumptown Coffee was sold to Pete's Coffee in 2015"
49:28;49:29;"for an undisclosed amount."
49:29;49:31;"And also, here's something interesting,"
49:31;49:33;"Stumptown has the rights to coldbrew.com."
49:33;49:36;"Okay, so we're talking to the right person."
49:36;49:37;"- That's hot real estate."
49:37;49:39;"- Let's get Brent on the phone."
49:39;49:42;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
49:42;49:45;"(phone ringing)"
49:45;49:47;"- Hello?"
49:47;49:48;"- Hey Brent?"
49:48;49:49;"- Hey, yeah, this is Brent."
49:49;49:50;"- Hey, how you doing?"
49:50;49:52;"This is Ezra and Jake from Time Crisis."
49:52;49:53;"- Hey Brent."
49:53;49:54;"- Hey guys, how's it going?"
49:54;49:56;"- Not bad, we may have butchered your last name."
49:56;49:58;"You wanna tell us how to pronounce it correctly?"
49:58;49:59;"- Yeah, totally."
49:59;50:01;"It's Walshinski."
50:01;50:02;"- Oh, we were close."
50:02;50:02;"- A tough one."
50:02;50:04;"A lot of consonants on there."
50:04;50:07;"- So Brent, you're the head brewer at Stumptown."
50:07;50:10;"How long have you been in the mix over at Stumptown?"
50:10;50:11;"- A little over seven years now."
50:11;50:12;"- So I'm very interested in this"
50:12;50:14;"because part of the reason we're talking about cold brew"
50:14;50:18;"is, you know, full disclosure, I have a negative view of it."
50:18;50:20;"- Oh."
50:20;50:21;"- This has got you journalism."
50:21;50:22;"- Yeah, yeah."
50:22;50:24;"(laughing)"
50:24;50:27;"- No, no, I might be, first of all,"
50:27;50:28;"the more we talk-- - You're a skeptic."
50:28;50:30;"- The more we talk about it, I start to question"
50:30;50:33;"if I know what I'm talking about about anything."
50:33;50:35;"But the first question that I've had is,"
50:35;50:36;"and I was talking with Jake,"
50:36;50:40;"just having this feeling lately that it's just everywhere."
50:40;50:44;"Starbucks has it, 7-Eleven has it, gas stations have it,"
50:44;50:48;"and in fact, cold brew has started to become synonymous"
50:48;50:50;"with iced coffee to the point that you see these kind of"
50:50;50:52;"hilarious things where people are like,"
50:52;50:54;"oh, I want a cold brew, do you mean an iced coffee?"
50:54;50:56;"We have, you know, like, it's all confused."
50:56;50:58;"So it's always interesting to see how something"
50:58;51:01;"just suddenly, seemingly suddenly,"
51:01;51:02;"just takes over the world."
51:02;51:06;"So Stumptown was something of a pioneer?"
51:06;51:07;"- I think so."
51:07;51:11;"I mean, cold brew, like, as an extraction process"
51:11;51:13;"was definitely around before Stumptown was around, right?"
51:13;51:16;"Like, extracting something with cold water"
51:16;51:19;"over a long period of time, like sun tea, right?"
51:19;51:20;"Like, that's kind of a similar idea"
51:20;51:22;"where you're letting tea sit in water"
51:22;51:25;"at a cooler temperature."
51:25;51:28;"- There's a long history, but this modern cold brew."
51:28;51:29;"So just paint a picture for me."
51:29;51:31;"What year was this when you started at Stumptown?"
51:31;51:33;"- 2011."
51:33;51:35;"At that time, cold brew was, I think,"
51:35;51:37;"maybe a little popular in cafes,"
51:37;51:39;"but not that big of a deal and kind of unknown."
51:39;51:42;"You know, we weren't pioneers in the cold brew process,"
51:42;51:44;"but we were pioneers in the idea of, like,"
51:44;51:46;"bottling it and turning it into, like,"
51:46;51:50;"this big, like, quick, easy thing."
51:50;51:51;"- Right, those little Stumptown bottles."
51:51;51:52;"That was like--"
51:52;51:54;"- Yeah, those stubbies."
51:54;51:55;"- So hold on a sec."
51:55;51:59;"If I walked into a Stumptown in 2010, 2009,"
51:59;52:01;"and asked for an iced coffee,"
52:01;52:03;"would I be getting a different product today"
52:03;52:06;"as opposed to 10 years ago, eight years ago?"
52:06;52:08;"- That's a good question."
52:08;52:10;"Just because I started in 2011."
52:10;52:12;"But no, I think there probably was a time"
52:12;52:14;"where we were doing iced coffee"
52:14;52:17;"in that we were brewing hot at double the strength"
52:17;52:19;"and then pouring over ice,"
52:19;52:21;"and then the ice dilutes into the solution,"
52:21;52:24;"and now you have, like, somewhere in the realm of, like,"
52:24;52:26;"the dissolved solids in that beverage"
52:26;52:27;"are, like, close to, like,"
52:27;52:30;"what you would get at a RTV coffee."
52:30;52:32;"I don't know when we started doing, like,"
52:32;52:33;"the cold brew process."
52:33;52:36;"I know it was definitely before the stubbies came out,"
52:36;52:39;"but so if you were to order a cold brew,"
52:39;52:41;"you would be getting something that was extracted"
52:41;52:45;"in cold water and diluted and served."
52:45;52:47;"- But that's, like, the standardized understanding"
52:47;52:51;"of iced coffee at Stumptown today."
52:51;52:51;"If you walk into a--"
52:51;52:54;"- Well, at Stumptown today, we don't serve iced coffee."
52:54;52:56;"- Right, so, like, the only cold coffee--"
52:56;52:58;"- So you guys murdered iced coffee."
52:58;53:00;"- I guess we have iced Americanos, you know,"
53:00;53:02;"that would qualify as iced coffee for sure."
53:02;53:05;"But in terms of, like, what a lot of people do, right,"
53:05;53:08;"it's, like, they brew a pour-over, right,"
53:08;53:11;"or a Fetco or whatever batch brew method"
53:11;53:14;"at twice the strength and then pour it over ice,"
53:14;53:15;"knowing that that ice is going to dilute."
53:15;53:17;"That's why they brew it at double the strength"
53:17;53:20;"and then serve that as iced coffee."

53:47;53:48;"Am I insane?"
53:48;53:51;"I have this feeling that I like iced Americanos"
53:51;53:53;"and I like iced coffee."
53:53;53:55;"My impression of cold brew is that it's sour."
53:55;53:56;"- Interesting."
53:56;53:57;"- Am I just crazy?"
53:57;53:58;"- No, I don't think you're crazy."
53:58;54:00;"I think, like, so here's the thing."
54:00;54:04;"I think right now, like, cold brew is such a new thing."
54:04;54:06;"I think the craft beer industry went through this too,"
54:06;54:08;"where, like, craft beer started."
54:08;54:12;"There were a few, like, really, really good beers out there,"
54:12;54:15;"but then, like, a ton of other people flooded the market"
54:15;54:17;"and were like, ""We can do this too,"""
54:17;54:20;"and made, like, a lot of really bad beer as well, right?"
54:20;54:23;"And I think, like, right now, we're sort of in that time"
54:23;54:27;"where there are some companies that are like,"
54:27;54:29;"""Oh, coffee and water, I got it."
54:29;54:30;"Like, we can totally do this."""
54:30;54:33;"And, like, they may not be interested"
54:33;54:35;"in buying high-quality coffee,"
54:35;54:38;"but they are interested in, like, the whole cold brew,"
54:38;54:40;"the excitement around cold brew,"
54:40;54:43;"and are using some form of the cold brew method,"
54:43;54:45;"but with, like, really low-quality coffee."
54:45;54:47;"- Does cold brew, do you think,"
54:47;54:50;"do the consumers read as fancier?"
54:50;54:51;"- I don't think, like, that's something"
54:51;54:55;"we're trying to portray."
54:55;54:56;"It is typically more expensive,"
54:56;54:59;"but that's because it takes a lot more coffee"
54:59;55:01;"to make cold brew."
55:01;55:02;"And that's why, typically, you know,"
55:02;55:04;"a lot of people say, like,"
55:04;55:05;"cold brew also makes them, like,"
55:05;55:06;"get really high on caffeine."
55:06;55:09;"Like, it really is, like, by volume,"
55:09;55:11;"more coffee dissolved into it."
55:11;55:12;"- That's not just a myth."
55:12;55:15;"You really could get more twisted off cold brew."
55:15;55:16;"- Totally."
55:16;55:17;"Yeah, yeah."
55:17;55:20;"Like, we've run some caffeine analysis on ours,"
55:20;55:22;"and, like, I think our stubby has something like"
55:22;55:25;"200, 250 milligrams of caffeine,"
55:25;55:27;"whereas, like, a typical 10-ounce, you know,"
55:27;55:30;"cup of coffee would probably be, like,"
55:30;55:32;"100 or 130 milligrams."
55:32;55:33;"- So it could almost be double,"
55:33;55:35;"just like a plain cup of coffee."
55:35;55:36;"- Yeah, and, like, a lot of our offerings"
55:36;55:39;"are, like, different TBSs, like, total dissolved solids."
55:39;55:42;"So, like, our original cold brew"
55:42;55:45;"is kind of, like, the most, like, refreshing"
55:45;55:47;"and has the most water versus coffee,"
55:47;55:50;"but something like our Nitro hairbender"
55:50;55:52;"is, like, a really, really high amount of coffee."
55:52;55:54;"And that's somewhere in the realm of, like,"
55:54;55:56;"400 milligrams of caffeine or so."
55:56;55:57;"But I guess to get back to your question"
55:57;55:59;"about whether or not it's fancy, like,"
55:59;56:02;"I think maybe some people do because it's typically"
56:02;56:04;"in the $4 or $5 range,"
56:04;56:06;"but I don't want to be this person who's saying, like,"
56:06;56:10;"this brew method is, like, 100% better."
56:10;56:12;"I think all brew methods are just different"
56:12;56:15;"and, you know, highlight different things"
56:15;56:16;"and are for different people."
56:16;56:18;"So that when someone's like, ""Oh, I don't like cold brew,"""
56:18;56:19;"I'm like, ""That's totally cool."""
56:19;56:21;"You know, like, ""I don't like mocha pot."""
56:21;56:22;"- Right, just a matter of taste."
56:22;56:24;"- Yeah, it's a different method."
56:24;56:25;"- Brent, when's the last time you had"
56:25;56:27;"just, like, a Dunkin' Donuts iced coffee?"
56:27;56:30;"- (laughs) That's a good question, too."
56:30;56:31;"I--"
56:31;56:33;"- Or coffee bean, just that type of place."
56:33;56:36;"- I, like, drink Starbucks, like, semi-frequently,"
56:36;56:38;"like, when I'm out camping or whatever,"
56:38;56:39;"you know, I'm, like, out in the middle of nowhere."
56:39;56:40;"I don't hate it, you know?"
56:40;56:43;"I'm not, like, sometimes I just, like, really need coffee."
56:43;56:46;"- Does anybody ever go make a Starbucks run"
56:46;56:47;"just to get out of the office?"
56:47;56:49;"- (laughs) That's a good question."
56:49;56:52;"No, I think I can firmly say, like,"
56:52;56:53;"that definitely does not happen."
56:53;56:56;"I think, like, we're also spoiled with free coffee"
56:56;56:57;"and great coffee."
56:57;56:59;"I don't know, it's just-- - Right."
56:59;57:01;"Have you tried, like, the Starbucks cold brew?"
57:01;57:02;"- Yeah, yeah, totally."
57:02;57:03;"- And it's decent?"
57:03;57:06;"- Yeah, no, I actually think they're doing a decent job"
57:06;57:10;"in regards to, like, extraction and process."
57:10;57:14;"Like, in that, I think a Starbucks cold brew"
57:14;57:16;"tastes like Starbucks coffee."
57:16;57:18;"There's no, like, adulteration or, like,"
57:18;57:22;"it's a clean, like, representation of Starbucks coffee."
57:22;57:23;"- Mm, that's interesting."
57:23;57:24;"- But I think in that regard, like,"
57:24;57:27;"I appreciate it from, like, the brewing aspect."
57:27;57:29;"Like, I think there are probably some really smart people"
57:29;57:32;"working at Starbucks working on these beverages."
57:32;57:35;"I personally don't like the typical profile of Starbucks."
57:35;57:38;"Like, I'm not craving it, but I don't--"
57:38;57:40;"- I feel you on that. - But at least it tracks"
57:40;57:42;"from beverage to beverage."
57:42;57:42;"- Yeah, yeah."
57:42;57:44;"- It's kinda like if you don't like"
57:44;57:45;"the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"
57:45;57:48;"but you still admire Avengers Infinity War"
57:48;57:49;"as an ambitious crossover event."
57:49;57:52;"- (laughs) I guess that's true, yeah."
57:52;57:54;"Or like Budweiser, right?"
57:54;57:57;"Like, I love a Budweiser sometimes,"
57:57;57:59;"but, like, what I mostly appreciate"
57:59;58:01;"and, like, find so incredible about them"
58:01;58:04;"is, like, you know, it's brewed all over the country,"
58:04;58:05;"and, like, no matter where you buy it,"
58:05;58:06;"it tastes exactly the same."
58:06;58:08;"Like, that's a pretty impressive feat."
58:08;58:09;"- No, you're right."
58:09;58:10;"I think so, I'm gonna be set for that."
58:10;58:12;"Well, thanks so much, Brent, for filling us in."
58:12;58:13;"- Yeah, totally."
58:13;58:15;"- I'm definitely gonna go roll down to a Stumptown soon."
58:15;58:17;"There's not one in my immediate neighborhood,"
58:17;58:18;"but this really makes me wanna go"
58:18;58:20;"explore the Stumptown menu a bit more."
58:20;58:21;"- Yeah, I mean, if you're ever in Portland,"
58:21;58:23;"I'd love to give you a tour of the facility."
58:23;58:24;"- Oh, that'd be sick."
58:24;58:27;"I'm sure we'll be up in Portland sometime in the next year."
58:27;58:28;"All right, thanks so much, man."
58:28;58:29;"Have a good one."
58:29;58:30;"- Yeah, you too."

01:00:35;01:00:37;"about something that's very time crisis-y."
01:00:37;01:00:41;"And that is Jason Alexander, AKA George Costanza,"

01:01:00;01:01:02;"Did you know the Colonel's first name?"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"Jake, you did?"
01:01:04;01:01:05;"- Oh yeah."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"- Harland Sanders."
01:01:06;01:01:09;"Beginning August 6th, ads featuring the sitcom veteran"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"as the Colonel and dinner time hero"
01:01:11;01:01:16;"will air on television and computer screens nationwide"
01:01:16;01:01:20;"to promote KFC's $20 Philips trademark,"
01:01:20;01:01:21;"which for the first time are available"
01:01:21;01:01:22;"in four different varieties."
01:01:22;01:01:26;"We could literally just talk about the press release."
01:01:26;01:01:27;"It's like then they shift."
01:01:27;01:01:29;"Modern families want and need mealtime"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"to be simple and stress-free."
01:01:31;01:01:34;"KFC knows this can be a feat when the clock strikes 5 p.m."
01:01:34;01:01:36;"and wants to help families solve the dinner time challenge"
01:01:36;01:01:37;"without sacrificing taste."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"It's true."
01:01:38;01:01:42;"A working family being able to go feed everybody"
01:01:42;01:01:44;"for a low price at KFC is helpful,"

01:01:46;01:01:49;"Language is like, chill."
01:01:49;01:01:52;"To do just that, KFC's enlisted sitcom king, Alexander,"

01:01:54;01:01:57;"including a new boneless filet $20 Philips."

01:02:10;01:02:11;"for families at great value."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"And there's no better person to spread the word"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"about our new family of four in a sitcom setting"
01:02:15;01:02:18;"than comedy extraordinaire, Jason Alexander."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"Alexander's background as the star"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"of one of the greatest sitcoms of all time"
01:02:21;01:02:22;"makes him the perfect choice."
01:02:22;01:02:25;"Then they have a quote from Jason."
01:02:25;01:02:26;"As the son of two working parents,"
01:02:26;01:02:28;"there were plenty of dinner times"
01:02:28;01:02:31;"when a bucket of chicken and all the fixins saved the day."
01:02:31;01:02:35;"It's been fun to combine my personal love for KFC"
01:02:35;01:02:38;"with my sitcom experience into a new take"
01:02:38;01:02:39;"on the role of Colonel Sanders."
01:02:39;01:02:41;"I feel like one time we were talking about this"
01:02:41;01:02:45;"after a time crisis is sometimes when people,"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"I mean, I think these days people don't get"
01:02:47;01:02:50;"particularly annoyed for somebody doing an ad."
01:02:50;01:02:51;"'Cause like at the end of the day,"
01:02:51;01:02:54;"it's like, yeah, we all eat KFC from time to time."
01:02:54;01:02:58;"Why get angry at like an actor, you know, musician?"
01:02:58;01:02:59;"It's fine."
01:02:59;01:03:02;"It's just interesting that very few people ever say,"
01:03:02;01:03:03;"when asked about like, you know,"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"why did you let your song be in this commercial?"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"Why did you participate in that?"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"And just be like, you know, 'cause I got no problem with it"
01:03:09;01:03:12;"and whatever, they paid for it."
01:03:12;01:03:13;"Who cares?"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"A lot of times people get a little defensive and say,"
01:03:15;01:03:17;"well, I actually eat KFC."
01:03:17;01:03:20;"It's not like I did this, you know, Boston market."
01:03:20;01:03:22;"There's some part of me that's always been like, who cares?"
01:03:22;01:03:23;"- Yeah."
01:03:23;01:03:26;"- I actually drink Pepsi, okay?"
01:03:26;01:03:27;"It actually made me feel good."
01:03:27;01:03:29;"I used to drink Pepsi with my grandpa."
01:03:29;01:03:30;"So, you know, leave me alone."
01:03:30;01:03:32;"And I don't know if that's what's happening"
01:03:32;01:03:32;"with Jason Alexander."
01:03:32;01:03:33;"- I can't really imagine that."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"- I did this for free."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"- Yeah, see, that's also funny too."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"It makes a lot more sense to me to be like,"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"somebody like asked me like,"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"why did you like have a Vampire Weekend song in a Honda ad?"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"Be like, who cares?"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"We said no to corporations we thought were horrible."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"Honda seemed fine."
01:03:46;01:03:46;"They paid for it."
01:03:46;01:03:47;"More people heard the song."
01:03:47;01:03:48;"That's why we did it."
01:03:48;01:03:51;"Versus like, I've actually driven in Hondas."
01:03:51;01:03:54;"I got high for the first time in a Honda."
01:03:54;01:03:55;"It's part of my heritage."
01:03:55;01:03:56;"Yeah, 'cause there's also something funny."
01:03:56;01:03:59;"It's like, if you like it so much, why charge?"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"So it actually makes more sense."
01:04:01;01:04:03;"Like, why did you let them use your song?"
01:04:03;01:04:05;"'Cause I wanted Honda to pay."
01:04:05;01:04:06;"Versus like--"
01:04:06;01:04:08;"- Yeah, I wanted to gouge those MFers."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"- And sometimes it feels that way."
01:04:10;01:04:11;"Nothing wrong with Honda."
01:04:11;01:04:12;"Please forgive me, Honda."
01:04:12;01:04:14;"- Listen, we had to do a retrofit"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"on the foundation of the house, okay?"
01:04:16;01:04:19;"The earthquake insurance was through the roof."
01:04:19;01:04:19;"- Or just say because--"
01:04:19;01:04:20;"- Needed the check."
01:04:20;01:04:22;"- 'Cause being an actor, being a musician,"
01:04:22;01:04:23;"it's inherently stressful,"
01:04:23;01:04:25;"and you take money where you can get it sometimes."
01:04:25;01:04:27;"Actually, here's something I've been thinking about"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"because I've been like watching so much Seinfeld lately"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"since we started doing Seinfeld Sundays."
01:04:31;01:04:33;"- Chronological order or just randos?"
01:04:33;01:04:36;"- I tend to watch a season in order, but I bounce around."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"I've always found the last couple seasons"
01:04:38;01:04:40;"very interesting when Larry David left."
01:04:40;01:04:41;"The music gets way hardcore."
01:04:41;01:04:44;"It starts to go pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow."
01:04:44;01:04:44;"- Really?"
01:04:44;01:04:47;"- The music gets really crazy, and the cuts got way faster."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"- Wow, I have to check that out."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"- Watch like season seven or season eight."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"It's kind of like Jerry just started doing his thing."
01:04:52;01:04:55;"And to his credit, season seven and eight"
01:04:55;01:04:59;"have so many classic episodes, and even conceptually."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"- Do you mean eight and nine?"
01:05:00;01:05:01;"- Oh, eight and nine, is that what I mean?"
01:05:01;01:05:06;"Yeah, eight and nine has like the yada yada episode."
01:05:06;01:05:07;"There's just so many classics,"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"but it's the cuts get way faster."
01:05:09;01:05:12;"There start to be these like 12 second scenes"
01:05:12;01:05:13;"where Jerry's like, ""Kramer, what are you doing?"""
01:05:13;01:05:15;"He's like, ""Ah, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow."""
01:05:15;01:05:17;"It just starts to move really quick."
01:05:17;01:05:20;"And also, they're outdoors a lot more."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"They're on this like fake New York street quite a bit."
01:05:22;01:05:23;"- Oh, I remember that."
01:05:23;01:05:25;"- The Warner soundstage."
01:05:25;01:05:27;"- It's like the world opened up a bit."
01:05:27;01:05:30;"I would say the humor didn't change at all,"
01:05:30;01:05:32;"but the pacing and the (imitates gun firing)"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"the Bizarro Jerry is also in those scenes."
01:05:34;01:05:39;"- This is also post the accidental death of Susan."
01:05:39;01:05:41;"So George's character now sort of has this like"
01:05:41;01:05:44;"dark cloud over him for the remainder of the show."
01:05:44;01:05:46;"- Really, he carried that?"
01:05:46;01:05:47;"- They reference it often."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"- Yeah. - Wow."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"- He works for this foundation that's been set up to--"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"- There's even an episode where he goes back to the store"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"where he bought the envelopes."
01:05:54;01:05:55;"- Yes."
01:05:55;01:05:58;"- But anyway, so I've been watching so much Seinfeld,"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"and then like it's actually been a problem"
01:06:00;01:06:01;"'cause it's all I wanna watch."
01:06:01;01:06:03;"And then I wanna watch secondary stuff."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"So I've been watching all like the DVD extras"
01:06:05;01:06:07;"that people have ripped and put on YouTube."
01:06:07;01:06:08;"And one thing I've been thinking about,"
01:06:08;01:06:11;"obviously he was so typecast as George,"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"but Jason Alexander in the interviews,"
01:06:13;01:06:16;"he actually seems like he's so warm,"
01:06:16;01:06:18;"even though he's an incredibly talented actor,"
01:06:18;01:06:21;"he's so deferential towards Larry and Jerry."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"He weirdly seems like he doesn't have a,"
01:06:23;01:06:24;"well, maybe not weirdly,"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"but he just seems like for a famous dude,"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"he just doesn't have a lot of ego about it."
01:06:28;01:06:30;"He truly like loved the show."
01:06:30;01:06:33;"He admired the writers and he did his thing."
01:06:33;01:06:33;"And he kinda comes from"
01:06:33;01:06:35;"a classically trained acting background,"
01:06:35;01:06:37;"maybe the only one of the four."
01:06:37;01:06:40;"So as I'm watching it, I was just kinda like,"
01:06:40;01:06:42;"Jason Alexander should be in more stuff."
01:06:42;01:06:43;"So I literally, before this came out,"
01:06:43;01:06:45;"I was thinking like,"
01:06:45;01:06:47;"how come he hasn't had some like breakout dark role"
01:06:47;01:06:49;"or like how come Jason Alexander"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"wasn't on like Breaking Bad or something?"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"- Yeah, playing someone's like weird dad or something"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"in some like dark indie movie."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"- Yeah, like he should be on like an HBO show"
01:06:57;01:06:58;"or like an indie movie."
01:06:58;01:07:01;"- Yeah, like a weird Todd Sollens movie or something."
01:07:01;01:07:02;"- Exactly."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"I was just thinking like, he's such a great actor"
01:07:04;01:07:07;"and he just even seems to have a great attitude"
01:07:07;01:07:09;"about the fact that he was a part of this"
01:07:09;01:07:10;"and he just seems very thankful."
01:07:10;01:07:14;"So anyway, I wanna see Jason Alexander get that money."
01:07:14;01:07:15;"I mean, I'm sure he's fine from Seinfeld,"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"but it's like, I'm not mad at it at all."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"So I just kinda wondered if like they offer him this"
01:07:19;01:07:22;"and he's like, ""Sure, I'll do it, that'll be fun."""
01:07:22;01:07:27;"♪ I have a mansion, forget the price ♪"
01:07:27;01:07:32;"♪ Ain't never been there, they tell me it's nice ♪"
01:07:32;01:07:37;"♪ I live in hotels, tear out the walls ♪"
01:07:37;01:07:42;"♪ I have accountants, pay for it all ♪"
01:07:42;01:07:47;"♪ They say I'm crazy, but I have a good time ♪"
01:07:51;01:07:55;"♪ I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime ♪"
01:07:55;01:07:59;"♪ Life's been good to me so far ♪"
01:07:59;01:08:02;"- You know what'd be cool?"
01:08:02;01:08:03;"Well, first of all, I guess the problem is"
01:08:03;01:08:04;"all these people are probably pretty loaded,"
01:08:04;01:08:07;"but it'd be cool to be like, just to hit everybody up"
01:08:07;01:08:08;"who was on ""Friends"" and ""Seinfeld,"""
01:08:08;01:08:11;"be like, who just wants to like be on a sitcom again?"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"Who's got too much time on their hands?"
01:08:13;01:08:14;"Or who just feels like acting?"
01:08:14;01:08:15;"Who's got a real love of the game?"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"And I wouldn't be surprised if Schwimmer and Alexander"
01:08:17;01:08:18;"were two of the guys who said,"
01:08:18;01:08:20;"""You know what, I (beep) love acting."""
01:08:20;01:08:23;"And be like, let's build a show around this."
01:08:23;01:08:25;"- Matt LeBlanc's in."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"- A ""Seinfeld"" and ""Friends"" mashup."
01:08:27;01:08:28;"We can't use the intellectual property,"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"but like, let's really get those acting chops."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"- Making my skin crawl."
01:08:32;01:08:32;"- What would you think of that?"
01:08:32;01:08:36;"- A solo crossover of Ross, old Ross,"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"and old George Costanza."
01:08:38;01:08:40;"- They both lived in New York City in the '90s."
01:08:40;01:08:42;"I guess this is going back to our ""Infinity War"" idea."
01:08:42;01:08:43;"- It is a little bit."
01:08:43;01:08:45;"- How about this?"
01:08:45;01:08:48;"A one-act play, Schwimmer and Alexander playing themselves,"
01:08:48;01:08:52;"and it's about them having a conversation"
01:08:52;01:08:55;"in the bathroom at the 1995 Emmys."
01:08:55;01:08:56;"- Like a Frost/Nixon type thing."
01:08:56;01:08:56;"- I like that."
01:08:56;01:08:58;"- This is great, this is great."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"- That's a good idea, dude."
01:08:59;01:09:00;"- Yeah."
01:09:00;01:09:03;"- But they get trapped in an elevator at the Four Seasons."
01:09:03;01:09:04;"- Yeah, this is good."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"- Maybe they even knew each other"
01:09:05;01:09:07;"as just like New York actors back in the day."
01:09:07;01:09:08;"- Sure."
01:09:08;01:09:09;"- And then they're just like kind of talking,"
01:09:09;01:09:12;"and maybe like Schwimmer has a chip on his shoulder,"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"like, you know what, man?"
01:09:14;01:09:16;"""Friends"" is an important sitcom too."
01:09:16;01:09:18;"Yeah, maybe it's not considered as smart as ""Seinfeld,"""
01:09:18;01:09:19;"but you know what, man?"
01:09:19;01:09:22;"It's like always hurt me, and then Jason's like,"
01:09:22;01:09:23;"""Why do you think I feel?"
01:09:23;01:09:24;"""I'm not Jerry, I'm not Larry."
01:09:24;01:09:26;"""We're both actors, and this (beep)"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"""damn 'Seinfeld'/""Friends' Civil War'"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"""has pushed us apart."""
01:09:30;01:09:31;"And they just like really get into it."
01:09:31;01:09:32;"- I watched that."
01:09:32;01:09:35;"- How about this, Kramer and Matt LeBlanc in an elevator?"
01:09:35;01:09:36;"- Ooh."
01:09:36;01:09:37;"- And Matt LeBlanc says to Kramer,"
01:09:37;01:09:40;"""Hey, man, you and me should grab a beer sometime,"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"""because we're both the comedic relief"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"""on very successful sitcoms."""
01:09:44;01:09:46;"And then Kramer's just like, ""No, thank you."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"""We have very little in common, sir."""
01:09:49;01:09:51;"- Yeah, I think that's exactly how it would go."
01:09:51;01:09:52;"- How come Kelsey Grammer gets to have"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"his gritty hour drama boss?"
01:09:55;01:09:56;"I've never seen it."
01:09:56;01:09:58;"Some people watch that show, right?"
01:09:58;01:09:59;"How come Jason Alexander doesn't get his--"
01:09:59;01:10:01;"- Maybe he's like, you think he's looking for it?"
01:10:01;01:10:03;"You think he's after it?"
01:10:03;01:10:04;"- Well, he had a show--"
01:10:04;01:10:05;"- We gotta get him on the horn."
01:10:05;01:10:06;"- Yeah. - We do, yeah."
01:10:06;01:10:07;"- He had a show this year."
01:10:07;01:10:09;"I think it was like a family,"
01:10:09;01:10:10;"like a Partridge family type of thing."
01:10:10;01:10:11;"- Really?"
01:10:11;01:10:12;"What was it called?"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"- I didn't watch it."
01:10:14;01:10:15;"- Comedy or drama?"
01:10:15;01:10:18;"- Maybe because people in the online Seinfeld fan community"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"didn't do enough to support the show."
01:10:20;01:10:23;"- Well, oh, it's called ""Hit the Road."""
01:10:23;01:10:25;"Alexander played Ken Swallow,"
01:10:25;01:10:29;"the patriarch of a modern day Partridge family."
01:10:29;01:10:32;"This was on, what channel was this on?"
01:10:32;01:10:33;"Audience Network."
01:10:33;01:10:34;"- Literally never heard of that."
01:10:34;01:10:36;"- Yeah, same."
01:10:36;01:10:37;"I think that's why I couldn't watch it."
01:10:37;01:10:38;"- What's the audience?"
01:10:38;01:10:39;"That's like a cable channel?"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"- It's a channel owned by AT&T."
01:10:42;01:10:46;"- And I think you can only see it through direct TV."
01:10:46;01:10:48;"- I feel like there was some onion or something"
01:10:48;01:10:49;"that was like a joke about like a new platform"
01:10:49;01:10:52;"that you could only view on the ordering screens"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"at McDonald's."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"What was the joke?"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"- I think that's what it was, yeah."
01:10:56;01:10:58;"- It's a platform owned by KFC."
01:10:58;01:11:00;"I have also lately been feeling like"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"there's just too much content."
01:11:02;01:11:03;"- Yeah."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"- It's been hard for me to wanna start a new show"
01:11:05;01:11:06;"or even a movie because,"
01:11:06;01:11:09;"and maybe it's similar to turning my back on cold brew"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"and just wanting to drink Dunkin' Donuts iced coffee."
01:11:11;01:11:12;"- You're just going old man here."
01:11:12;01:11:14;"- I'm going old man."
01:11:14;01:11:16;"I wanna drink Dunkin' Donuts iced coffee"
01:11:16;01:11:17;"and I wanna watch Seinfeld."
01:11:17;01:11:19;"- Get into Succession."
01:11:19;01:11:20;"Get into Yellowstone."
01:11:20;01:11:22;"- Oh, that last episode."
01:11:22;01:11:23;"Did you see it?"
01:11:23;01:11:23;"- Oh yeah."
01:11:23;01:11:24;"- Of Yellowstone?"
01:11:24;01:11:25;"- Succession."
01:11:26;01:11:27;"Great show, Yellowstone's great."
01:11:27;01:11:29;"I'm pumped for Ozark to return."
01:11:29;01:11:31;"I'm pumped for Better Call Saul to return."
01:11:31;01:11:34;"- Better Call Saul is back and no one's talking about it."
01:11:34;01:11:35;"Do you notice that?"
01:11:35;01:11:36;"There was no hype?"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"- Yeah."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"- It was on Wednesday."
01:11:39;01:11:40;"- You guys are speaking Russian."
01:11:40;01:11:42;"I don't understand a word you're saying."
01:11:42;01:11:43;"You know what, Jake?"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"You and I are just different people."
01:11:45;01:11:47;"You're a $5 cold brew."
01:11:47;01:11:50;"- Premium cable drama watching."
01:11:50;01:11:53;"- Jake's posted up at Civilian Coffee"
01:11:53;01:11:56;"with an $8 cold brew,"
01:11:56;01:11:59;"watching the latest episode of Succession on HBO Go"
01:11:59;01:12:00;"on his tablet."
01:12:00;01:12:03;"- Ezra's just ham and egging it over here."
01:12:03;01:12:07;"He's drinking his D&D iced coffee."
01:12:07;01:12:08;"- I'm at Dunkin' Donuts."
01:12:08;01:12:11;"- He's getting in that minivan with 240,000 miles on it."
01:12:11;01:12:16;"- I'm at Dunkin' Donuts watching Seinfeld on my tablet."
01:12:16;01:12:17;"- Oh man."
01:12:17;01:12:18;"- I think also, you know,"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"like maybe it's from working on the album so long"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"and like having, you know,"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"having to play shows and just so much on my mind."
01:12:23;01:12:26;"It's kind of like when we worked on Contra,"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"I could only watch The Office."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"- Oh wow, okay."
01:12:29;01:12:30;"- And actually later I found out that for a lot of people,"
01:12:30;01:12:33;"The Office is like a classic comfort food show."
01:12:33;01:12:34;"- Yeah."
01:12:34;01:12:35;"- Like sometimes I've talked to people who are like,"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"""Oh yeah, I love to watch The Office."""
01:12:37;01:12:38;"And I was like, ""Yeah?"""
01:12:38;01:12:39;"And they're like, ""Yeah."""
01:12:39;01:12:41;"I watched from the first season to the last"
01:12:41;01:12:42;"and it started over again."
01:12:42;01:12:43;"- I don't understand that."
01:12:43;01:12:45;"I would never rewatch The Office."
01:12:45;01:12:48;"And people like throw on TV in like an ambient way."
01:12:48;01:12:49;"Like it's just on in the back."
01:12:49;01:12:50;"I've never understood that."
01:12:50;01:12:53;"- Would you rewatch Seinfeld?"
01:12:53;01:12:54;"- Yeah, not in its entirety,"
01:12:54;01:12:57;"but I would like, if I'm in a specific mood,"
01:12:57;01:12:57;"I'd be like, ""Oh, I'll throw Seinfeld on."""
01:12:57;01:12:59;"- It's because these sitcoms are more comforting"
01:12:59;01:13:01;"because, you know,"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"I've watched maybe The Sopranos three times"
01:13:03;01:13:05;"and I'm kind of want to watch it for a fourth time."
01:13:05;01:13:08;"But it's like, it's an emotional dark experience for me."
01:13:08;01:13:09;"- I don't rewatch TV."
01:13:09;01:13:10;"It's so--"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"- You never rewatch The Sopranos?"
01:13:12;01:13:13;"Well, you know, that's an important cultural artifact"
01:13:13;01:13:15;"for where I'm from. - No, I know."
01:13:15;01:13:16;"I could see it."
01:13:16;01:13:17;"For me, if I'm gonna watch something,"
01:13:17;01:13:18;"I want it to be like new."
01:13:18;01:13:21;"I'm really, I'm gonna really give it my attention."
01:13:21;01:13:25;"- I know, it's the exact opposite attitude you have to music."
01:13:25;01:13:26;"- It's absolutely true."
01:13:26;01:13:27;"- It's funny."
01:13:27;01:13:30;"You to music is like me to TV and coffee."

01:15:14;01:15:17;"- Seinfeld, I feel like I noticed"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"that you were tweeting with somebody who was like,"
01:15:19;01:15:21;"I've just been listening to some late TC episodes,"
01:15:21;01:15:23;"what are other good ones to listen to or something?"
01:15:23;01:15:25;"And you said you should go back to the start,"
01:15:25;01:15:27;"but then people were commenting on that,"
01:15:27;01:15:29;"or replying and saying,"
01:15:29;01:15:30;"well, here's different good ones to check out."
01:15:30;01:15:33;"And I was like, we gotta put together greatest hits,"
01:15:33;01:15:37;"TC episode, because for us, it's just such a rant."
01:15:37;01:15:40;"Like we can't remember where the good runs were."
01:15:40;01:15:42;"We can't remember the good conversations."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"The TC heads, no, but."
01:15:44;01:15:46;"- Grape Ice Cream."
01:15:46;01:15:47;"- Grape Ice Cream."
01:15:47;01:15:50;"What other stuff do people like?"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"The One Direction on Nantucket movie."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"What was that one about?"
01:15:54;01:15:55;"- Yeah, the hardware store."
01:15:55;01:15:56;"- The hardware store."
01:15:56;01:15:57;"- Oh, that horrid."
01:15:57;01:16:01;"Bedsheets, obviously that was like a three, three-parter."
01:16:01;01:16:03;"- We've had some great. - My ribs."
01:16:03;01:16:05;"- Oh yeah, Lonnie's dad."
01:16:05;01:16:05;"- Lonnie's dad."
01:16:05;01:16:07;"- Yeah, that's the two fridge."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"- Lonnie's dad, the two fridge,"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"that's pretty legendary for me."
01:16:10;01:16:12;"Anyway, that's a long-term project,"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"is the Time Crisis archive project."
01:16:14;01:16:15;"You know what, we gotta start making"
01:16:15;01:16:17;"dicks pics of Time Crisis."
01:16:17;01:16:19;"- TCDB.com."
01:16:19;01:16:22;"- Okay, we're gonna start putting out compilations"
01:16:22;01:16:26;"that are the best choice nugs from Time Crisis"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"on very nice limited edition vinyl."
01:16:28;01:16:31;"And it's gonna be volume one through 10,"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"and we're gonna pick the best of the best."
01:16:33;01:16:34;"- Yep."
01:16:34;01:16:37;"- But we need a name like Dicks Pics."
01:16:37;01:16:39;"I mean, it could be Jake's Takes,"
01:16:39;01:16:41;"but I've always felt like it didn't make quite enough sense."
01:16:41;01:16:42;"- No, no, I don't think that's it."
01:16:42;01:16:44;"- Jake's Rakes?"
01:16:44;01:16:45;"Jake's raked the leaves of Time Crisis"
01:16:45;01:16:47;"and cleaned it up into something."
01:16:47;01:16:49;"- I was pushing it."
01:16:49;01:16:50;"- Nothing around Desiree, so that's."
01:16:50;01:16:52;"- Or something to do with the Crisis Crew?"
01:16:52;01:16:53;"- True Crew?"
01:16:53;01:16:56;"- Let's see what some synonyms for pics are."
01:16:56;01:16:57;"Choice."
01:16:57;01:16:58;"- Choice Crew."
01:16:58;01:16:59;"- Crisis Choice."
01:16:59;01:17:00;"- What rhymes with select?"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"- Detect?"
01:17:02;01:17:02;"- Crew."
01:17:02;01:17:03;"- This is."
01:17:03;01:17:04;"- This is really."
01:17:04;01:17:07;"- This is really scraping the bottom."
01:17:07;01:17:10;"(laughing)"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"- This show rules."
01:17:12;01:17:13;"- This show rules."
01:17:13;01:17:16;"- This is almost like behind the scenes."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"(laughing)"
01:17:18;01:17:19;"BTS."
01:17:19;01:17:21;"- Breaking the fourth wall."
01:17:21;01:17:24;"Okay, EddieTC Heads, if you can come up with a good idea"
01:17:24;01:17:29;"what we can name our numero group of vinyl selections."
01:17:29;01:17:30;"- Yeah, yeah, hit us up."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"- I mean, it could be Seinfeld Selections."
01:17:32;01:17:33;"Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue."
01:17:33;01:17:36;"Seinfeld Selects, better."
01:17:36;01:17:38;"We could make it intentionally awkward."
01:17:38;01:17:41;"Like, top choice of Seinfeld."
01:17:41;01:17:42;"A little like a weird translation."
01:17:42;01:17:44;"- Or you could just name each album"
01:17:44;01:17:46;"off of like one of the tracks."
01:17:46;01:17:49;"Like the first one could just call like Grape Ice Cream."
01:17:49;01:17:50;"- Right."
01:17:50;01:17:51;"- You know."
01:17:51;01:17:52;"Second album's called Lonnie's Dad."
01:17:52;01:17:53;"- It could be, yeah, so it could be like"
01:17:53;01:17:55;"Time Crisis Volume 3 Lonnie's Dad."
01:17:55;01:17:56;"- Yeah, yeah, exactly."
01:17:56;01:17:59;"- Okay, but if anybody has a good idea let us know."
01:17:59;01:18:01;"Okay, time for top five."
01:18:01;01:18:03;"- It's time for the top five."
01:18:03;01:18:07;"Five on iTunes."
01:18:07;01:18:10;"- Okay, so this is gonna be a pretty interesting one."
01:18:10;01:18:14;"We're doing the top five songs on iTunes right now"
01:18:14;01:18:18;"versus the Billboard top five of this week in 1999."
01:18:18;01:18:19;"Why '99?"
01:18:19;01:18:23;"- That was the year that Stumptown was founded"
01:18:23;01:18:24;"in Portland, Oregon."
01:18:24;01:18:26;"Also the year I graduated college in Portland, Oregon."
01:18:26;01:18:27;"- Really?"
01:18:27;01:18:28;"- Yeah, man."
01:18:28;01:18:30;"First Stumptown on Belmont Street."
01:18:30;01:18:31;"- That's kinda interesting."
01:18:31;01:18:33;"You graduate college."
01:18:33;01:18:34;"- Third wave takes off."
01:18:34;01:18:36;"- And third wave takes off."
01:18:36;01:18:38;"So that's a hell of a way to enter the workforce."
01:18:38;01:18:40;"- I didn't work there, I worked at Papa John's."
01:18:40;01:18:42;"- I know, but you probably grabbed a cold brew there"
01:18:42;01:18:43;"or an iced coffee."
01:18:43;01:18:44;"- Hot cup."
01:18:44;01:18:46;"- You know, that'd be like graduating college"
01:18:46;01:18:49;"in '69 with the moon landing."
01:18:49;01:18:52;"- I was gonna say when Levi Strauss is starting"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"in San Francisco."
01:18:54;01:18:54;"- No, the gap."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"- You're right."
01:18:55;01:18:57;"- Sometimes people graduate college at a time"
01:18:57;01:18:59;"when there's like an oil crisis"
01:18:59;01:19:02;"and sometimes they graduate when there's"
01:19:02;01:19:05;"new retail opportunities or technologies taking off."
01:19:05;01:19:06;"- Boom."
01:19:06;01:19:07;"- It depends, the world you're entering into"
01:19:07;01:19:08;"is very different."
01:19:08;01:19:09;"So we're doing '99."
01:19:09;01:19:13;"The number five song in '99, Jennifer Lopez,"
01:19:13;01:19:14;"If You Had My Love."
01:19:14;01:19:18;"- August of '99."
01:19:18;01:19:20;"- That sound is already just so '99."
01:19:20;01:19:22;"- So is it like a harpsichord, like a fake harpsichord?"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"- Yeah, it could be a keyboard,"
01:19:24;01:19:28;"like a chord guitar sound or something, who knows?"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"Yes, or a harpsichord."
01:19:30;01:19:37;"- This song is dope, though."
01:19:37;01:19:38;"- Yeah."
01:19:38;01:19:39;"- You a fan?"
01:19:39;01:19:40;"- Oh yeah."
01:19:40;01:19:42;"- This was her breakout hit, right?"
01:19:42;01:19:42;"This was her first."
01:19:42;01:19:45;"- Produced by Rodney Jerkins, great producer."
01:19:45;01:19:54;"Michael Jackson showed interest in this song,"
01:19:54;01:19:57;"but felt that it was better suited for a female artist."
01:19:57;01:19:58;"Yeah, you can actually really picture it."
01:19:58;01:19:59;"- Totally."
01:19:59;01:20:00;"- Oh yeah, he would murder this."

01:40:56;01:41:00;"is like closer aesthetically and musically"
01:41:00;01:41:03;"to like the 70s than it is to now?"
01:41:03;01:41:06;"'Cause in a way, it's almost like a halfway point"
01:41:06;01:41:08;"between now and like the late, mid-late--"
01:41:08;01:41:12;"- 1999 would be round up to 20 and then be like 79."
01:41:12;01:41:13;"I would say no."
01:41:13;01:41:15;"I would say the music of today is more in common with 99"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"because, you know, like when we would listen"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"to the J-Lo and to the DJ Khaled,"
01:41:19;01:41:21;"you're kinda like, this (beep) not a million miles away."
01:41:21;01:41:24;"There's certain kinda things that date the 99 stuff,"
01:41:24;01:41:26;"certain sounds, but it's like--"
01:41:26;01:41:29;"- I feel like the songwriting of the 99 stuff"
01:41:29;01:41:32;"is closer to the 70s, kinda what we're talking about"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"with the chord regressions and whatnot."
01:41:34;01:41:35;"- But how, you know, what's the songwriting"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"if I like it so different than ""Bills, Bills, Bills""?"
01:41:37;01:41:39;"""Bills, Bills, Bills"" is like a tighter song"
01:41:39;01:41:40;"'cause it's specifically about one thing,"
01:41:40;01:41:42;"but I don't know."
01:41:42;01:41:45;"- My theory, this could be totally off base."
01:41:45;01:41:49;"The stuff from 99 was not written on a computer."
01:41:49;01:41:51;"It was like a person with a keyboard or something"
01:41:51;01:41:53;"putting a melody over chords,"
01:41:53;01:41:55;"and then they were like, let's produce the song now."
01:41:55;01:41:57;"- Which was on a computer."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:41:58;01:42:02;"But this stuff on the 2018 stuff, to me, sounds like,"
01:42:02;01:42:04;"they're just like, let's take some sounds"
01:42:04;01:42:05;"and samples and loops and stuff"
01:42:05;01:42:09;"and just build it off the computer."
01:42:09;01:42:11;"- Well, people definitely were doing that in the 90s."
01:42:11;01:42:12;"- I'm sure. - Like a lot of hip hop,"
01:42:12;01:42:13;"but you're saying specifically--"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"- Well, what I'm saying, the songs that we're listening to--"
01:42:15;01:42:16;"- The top five. - Yes."
01:42:16;01:42:21;"- KC and JoJo, somebody who really plays music,"
01:42:21;01:42:22;"sat down at a keyboard or a piano"
01:42:22;01:42:25;"and wrote the chord progression and worked on it."
01:42:25;01:42:27;"- Yeah, I think all three of them."
01:42:27;01:42:28;"I think the J-Lo and the--"
01:42:28;01:42:30;"- You're right, but the Cardi B is a sample"
01:42:30;01:42:33;"plus a Freddie Ruhr and the Bill Trapp beat."
01:42:33;01:42:34;"- Yeah. - But of course,"
01:42:34;01:42:37;"people were doing that, samples plus the beat of the day"
01:42:37;01:42:38;"in the late 90s."
01:42:38;01:42:41;"- I'm not saying it's a failure of Western civilization."
01:42:41;01:42:42;"- You're just saying it's a difference."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"- Yeah, I mean, I kind of am."
01:42:44;01:42:45;"- But you know what, you still get plenty"
01:42:45;01:42:48;"of these music school kind of geeks in the mix"
01:42:48;01:42:51;"with pop and rap who sit down at a keyboard"
01:42:51;01:42:52;"and play, you know, you could play you anything."
01:42:52;01:42:54;"Be like, make it more 70s, make it more jazzy."
01:42:54;01:42:57;"- Yeah, is there a KC and JoJo of now?"
01:42:57;01:42:58;"- What would be? - I don't know."
01:42:58;01:43:00;"- What are the defining characteristics?"
01:43:00;01:43:02;"Like kind of super emotional R&B"
01:43:02;01:43:06;"that has this kind of like elegant baroque touch in a way."
01:43:06;01:43:09;"- Yeah, like, I don't know, those kinds of changes."
01:43:09;01:43:12;"And like-- - Well, Florida Georgia Line."
01:43:12;01:43:13;"- Maybe Florida Georgia Line."
01:43:13;01:43:16;"- Jesus Christ. - No, there's definitely,"
01:43:16;01:43:17;"well, like, I know what you mean,"
01:43:17;01:43:19;"because I think, you know, KC and JoJo"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"and people from that era are still making music."
01:43:21;01:43:24;"I think a lot of the sounds of KC and JoJo,"
01:43:24;01:43:25;"there's still people making new music that sounds like that,"
01:43:25;01:43:28;"but it would read as kind of grown up."
01:43:28;01:43:29;"- Like quaint. - Or quaint,"
01:43:29;01:43:34;"or just like the, you know, to a certain type of listener"
01:43:34;01:43:35;"who maybe is in their 40s or 50s now,"
01:43:35;01:43:38;"and KC and JoJo, they love that type of music,"
01:43:38;01:43:39;"and they love stuff that sounds like,"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"it's also like there might be like a rock listener"
01:43:41;01:43:45;"who loves Wilco, and they loved Wilco when Wilco was new."
01:43:45;01:43:46;"- Yep."
01:43:46;01:43:49;"- And they still love music in that vein,"
01:43:49;01:43:50;"you know, like whatever you wanna call it,"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"like a acoustic analog Americana."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"- Sure. - But maybe that,"
01:43:54;01:43:56;"and of course, there's always gonna be a lane for that."
01:43:56;01:43:58;"It's just not on the charts right now,"
01:43:58;01:43:59;"aside from Florida Georgia Line,"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"who's keeping the flame alive for Americana,"
01:44:01;01:44:03;"and KC and JoJo."
01:44:03;01:44:05;"- Americana and R&B."
01:44:05;01:44:05;"- That's right."
01:44:05;01:44:07;"All right, it's time to get to the number ones."
01:44:07;01:44:08;"Okay, first thing I wanna say,"
01:44:08;01:44:12;"the number one song in 1999,"
01:44:12;01:44:13;"and the number one song in 2018,"
01:44:13;01:44:16;"are the exact same length, three minutes and 38 seconds."
01:44:16;01:44:18;"- Wow. - That's kind of freaky."
01:44:18;01:44:20;"'Cause that's a freaky, this is a freaky Friday."
01:44:20;01:44:21;"- That's a TC first."
01:44:21;01:44:22;"- The number one song."
01:44:22;01:44:24;"I feel like, wasn't there some thing,"
01:44:24;01:44:26;"there was like a website or something"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"where somebody said something about that,"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"the most important song to you,"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"or the one that's gonna reflect your taste or your life,"
01:44:32;01:44:36;"is gonna be what was number one when you were 14."
01:44:36;01:44:38;"Wasn't that, does that sound familiar to you guys?"
01:44:38;01:44:39;"- Yeah, sort of."
01:44:39;01:44:41;"- And somebody built a website that was like,"
01:44:41;01:44:43;"find out what was number one on your 14th birthday."
01:44:43;01:44:44;"- Right."
01:44:44;01:44:45;"- Yeah, so there's a website,"
01:44:45;01:44:47;"find out what was number one on your 14th birthday,"
01:44:47;01:44:49;"and why it matters."
01:44:49;01:44:51;"It's supposedly the song that defines your life."
01:44:51;01:44:52;"So anyway, I don't know if this song"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"was number one on my 14th birthday,"
01:44:54;01:44:57;"but this is a song I associate a lot with being 14."
01:44:57;01:44:59;"And kind of starting to think about culture and music"
01:44:59;01:45:02;"in a new way, kind of realizing a little bit"
01:45:02;01:45:07;"the mechanisms of marketing and business behind culture"
01:45:07;01:45:08;"and things like that."
01:45:08;01:45:09;"And this song made a big impression on me"
01:45:09;01:45:12;"because I love elements of this song."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"There's elements of the song I found very haunting."
01:45:14;01:45:15;"There's parts I don't like as much."
01:45:15;01:45:17;"And also, it's funny, 'cause sometimes when you're 14,"
01:45:17;01:45:19;"and a lot of what's on the charts"
01:45:19;01:45:21;"are kind of like about being 14."
01:45:21;01:45:24;"So this song is about a young woman"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"who's not sure if she really wants to have sex yet,"
01:45:26;01:45:31;"but she's kind of down as long as she's treated correctly."
01:45:31;01:45:32;"So it's definitely from the point of view"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"of a younger person."
01:45:34;01:45:35;"- Okay."
01:45:35;01:45:37;"- And the opening of it, I always found very haunting."
01:45:40;01:45:45;"Like there's something about this part that's so sad."
01:45:45;01:45:47;"It makes me think of naive melody."
01:45:47;01:45:48;"You're just talking like,"
01:45:48;01:45:51;"(imitates melody)"
01:45:51;01:45:54;"The drums are a little hyper, but."
01:45:57;01:46:00;"Isn't there something so sad about this?"
01:46:00;01:46:03;"(imitates melody)"
01:46:03;01:46:04;"It's like a little detuned."

01:46:11;01:46:14;"And even just the opening line,"
01:46:14;01:46:16;"that's like a strong opening line for a pop song."
01:46:16;01:46:17;"I feel like I've been locked up tight"
01:46:17;01:46:20;"for a century of lonely nights"
01:46:20;01:46:21;"waiting for someone to release me."
01:46:21;01:46:23;"It's like so grandiose."
01:46:23;01:46:23;"- Damn."

01:48:35;01:48:37;"Okay, so she didn't write the lyrics."
01:48:37;01:48:38;"But there's also something funny, it's about like,"
01:48:38;01:48:42;"the first verse is talking about teen horniness"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"in this like super grandiose poetic terms."
01:48:44;01:48:47;"Like, I feel like this longing that I have--"
01:48:47;01:48:48;"- In my loins."
01:48:48;01:48:51;"- In my loins, I've been banished for it."
01:48:51;01:48:53;"There's a war going on in my body"
01:48:53;01:48:56;"between my desire and what I know I must do."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"I literally feel like I've been locked away for a century."
01:48:58;01:49:00;"And then the second one is just like,"
01:49:00;01:49:01;"listen, our hormones are popping,"
01:49:01;01:49:03;"but we don't have to have sex tonight."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"I guess racing at the speed of light is poetic."
01:49:05;01:49:09;"- Speed of light, no, it is like the most stock phrase ever."
01:49:09;01:49:11;"- It's kind of very like family sitcom too,"
01:49:11;01:49:12;"like Malcolm in the Middle, like--"
01:49:12;01:49:13;"- I know that's also--"
01:49:13;01:49:16;"- The hormones are just racing at the speed of light."
01:49:16;01:49:19;"Listen, Christina, oh, Christina,"
01:49:19;01:49:22;"I know your hormones are racing at the speed of light,"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"but that doesn't mean it has to be tonight."
01:49:24;01:49:27;"And nothing else matters."
01:49:27;01:49:31;"- Yeah, I wonder also, is this song,"
01:49:31;01:49:32;"'cause she was like a post-Disney person."
01:49:32;01:49:33;"So I wonder if there was--"
01:49:33;01:49:35;"- Maybe she was like 20 or something."
01:49:35;01:49:39;"- No, she might've been younger than 18."
01:49:39;01:49:40;"I wonder if there was a thought,"
01:49:40;01:49:43;"'cause like this is the big first single"
01:49:43;01:49:46;"of a former Mickey Mouse Club person becoming a pop star."
01:49:46;01:49:48;"So I wonder if there was any thought put into like,"
01:49:48;01:49:49;"what tone are we trying to strike here?"
01:49:49;01:49:52;"Or maybe they wrote the song not even for her, I don't know."
01:49:52;01:49:53;"'Cause later in her career"
01:49:53;01:49:55;"was when she like embraced sexuality."
01:49:55;01:49:57;"Remember she had like a single, ""Dirty""?"
01:49:57;01:49:58;"- Kind of."
01:49:58;01:49:59;"- That was about being dirty and naughty."
01:49:59;01:50:01;"But this song is like about ambivalence."
01:50:01;01:50:05;"It's weird, like I wonder if kind of like abstinence only,"
01:50:05;01:50:08;"like kind of religious type people heard this song"
01:50:08;01:50:10;"and they were like, ""Thank you."""
01:50:10;01:50:11;"Or if they were just like, ""Wait a second."""
01:50:11;01:50:12;"- You're on thin ice here."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"- Yeah, okay, I like the part about"
01:50:14;01:50:15;"it doesn't have to be tonight."
01:50:15;01:50:18;"And I like the part about, you know, being locked away."
01:50:18;01:50:21;"And I like that, you know, that the genie's within a bottle."
01:50:21;01:50:23;"What about all this rub me the right way stuff?"
01:50:23;01:50:26;"- Also the delivery is very sultry."
01:50:26;01:50:27;"- They're kind of trying to have it both ways,"
01:50:27;01:50:29;"I guess, with this song."
01:50:29;01:50:30;"- Riding that fine line."
01:50:30;01:50:32;"- It made me think also about the Spice Girls."
01:50:32;01:50:35;"It was kind of similar, that it was a song"
01:50:35;01:50:36;"seeming a little bit about sex."
01:50:36;01:50:38;"It's kind of like laying down the ground rules."
01:50:38;01:50:40;"If you want to be my lover, you got to give me my friends."
01:50:40;01:50:42;"- I never understood what the hell."
01:50:42;01:50:44;"- I'm a genie in a bottle, you got to rub me the right way."
01:50:44;01:50:45;"Here's the rules."
01:50:45;01:50:47;"- What was the first big Britney single?"
01:50:47;01:50:48;"- Um."
01:50:48;01:50:49;"- Right, it's like the year before this."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"- Hit me baby one more time."
01:50:51;01:50:52;"But I'd also had some similar sentiments."
01:50:52;01:50:55;"My loneliness is killing me, I must confess."
01:50:55;01:51:00;"I still believe, when I'm not with you I lose my mind."
01:51:00;01:51:01;"Give me a sign."
01:51:01;01:51:03;"- Damn dude, you just tapped in on these Britney lyrics."
01:51:03;01:51:06;"- Well no, for me being that age, I couldn't help it."
01:51:06;01:51:07;"- That's in your bloodstream."
01:51:07;01:51:08;"- Yeah."
01:51:08;01:51:11;"♪ My loneliness is killing me ♪"
01:51:11;01:51:14;"There even was a slight Britney versus Christina thing."
01:51:14;01:51:15;"Wasn't there?"
01:51:15;01:51:15;"- Yeah."
01:51:15;01:51:17;"- They were kind of positioned against each other."
01:51:17;01:51:20;"- I thought Britney was like sort of the more like wholesome."
01:51:20;01:51:21;"- Yeah."
01:51:21;01:51:24;"- All American, like Mad Men era, Girl Next Door"
01:51:24;01:51:27;"or something, and Christina was like the like edgier one."
01:51:27;01:51:27;"- I think there's an element of that."
01:51:27;01:51:28;"- Is that, is that?"
01:51:28;01:51:29;"- Whatever."
01:51:29;01:51:31;"- Anyway, the number one song in 2018,"
01:51:31;01:51:33;"also three minutes 38 seconds."
01:51:33;01:51:36;"The first time I heard this song was on the show."
01:51:36;01:51:38;"And I said, I couldn't tell what's so special about it."
01:51:38;01:51:39;"This is one of those songs that now,"
01:51:39;01:51:40;"because it's a meme, it's a fake hit."
01:51:40;01:51:41;"- Are you in now?"
01:51:41;01:51:44;"- Well now at least I have to admit that it's catchy."
01:51:44;01:51:47;"- Are you aware of the In My Feelings dancing and stuff"
01:51:47;01:51:48;"and people jump out of the car"
01:51:48;01:51:49;"and they do this whole dance to it?"
01:51:49;01:51:50;"- No."
01:51:50;01:51:52;"- But have you heard ♪ Kiki, do you love me ♪"

01:52:55;01:52:58;"Is the ♪ Kiki do you love me ♪"
01:52:58;01:52:59;"You haven't been hearing that around?"
01:52:59;01:53:00;"- No."
01:53:00;01:53:01;"- Well, it's a big old hit."
01:53:01;01:53:03;"- For the next few months."
01:53:03;01:53:06;"When was the last time you heard hotline bling?"
01:53:06;01:53:07;"- Not much, but you know, that's the thing."
01:53:07;01:53:08;"Rap moves faster."
01:53:08;01:53:09;"- Is that what it is?"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"I just, it's weird to me that like,"
01:53:11;01:53:13;"the songs are like everywhere for a few months"
01:53:13;01:53:15;"and then they're just like gone."
01:53:15;01:53:17;"- Well, somebody like Drake has so much music"
01:53:17;01:53:18;"and he has said so many hits"
01:53:18;01:53:22;"and so many culturally important, impactful songs."
01:53:22;01:53:23;"I was thinking about that."
01:53:23;01:53:25;"Like we're rolling up to these festivals, no new music."
01:53:25;01:53:26;"- Yeah."
01:53:26;01:53:28;"- Just busting out Oxford comma."
01:53:28;01:53:31;"- Yeah, heard that on the drive the other day."
01:53:31;01:53:34;"- That song has been out for 10 years."
01:53:34;01:53:35;"- Yeah."
01:53:35;01:53:36;"- It was written 12 years ago."
01:53:36;01:53:38;"But for me, it doesn't feel that old."
01:53:38;01:53:40;"I don't know if I'm just, if I'm tripping or something,"
01:53:40;01:53:42;"but this is probably wishful thinking,"
01:53:42;01:53:45;"but I almost feel like whatever your timeline,"
01:53:45;01:53:47;"it's only as far away as however much music"
01:53:47;01:53:49;"you released in between."
01:53:49;01:53:51;"So between Drake's first album and now,"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"he's been on hundreds of songs."
01:53:53;01:53:56;"Between Vampire Weekend's first album and now,"
01:53:56;01:53:59;"I've been part of 25 songs."
01:53:59;01:54:00;"- No, more than that."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"- Two albums and a handful of other things."
01:54:02;01:54:03;"It's not a lot."
01:54:03;01:54:04;"- Well, three albums."
01:54:04;01:54:06;"- Well, I meant first, yeah, I don't know."
01:54:06;01:54:07;"- Okay."
01:54:07;01:54:07;"- I don't know what I'm saying."
01:54:07;01:54:08;"- I gotcha."
01:54:08;01:54:09;"- If you're not worried about having hits"
01:54:09;01:54:11;"on an important part of culture,"
01:54:11;01:54:12;"you can just take your sweet time."
01:54:12;01:54:13;"- That's what I'm doing."
01:54:13;01:54:15;"(laughing)"
01:54:15;01:54:16;"- Taking the long game."
01:54:16;01:54:17;"- Still working on my first solo album."
01:54:17;01:54:18;"- You know what's funny?"
01:54:18;01:54:20;"The other day, it just popped into my head,"
01:54:20;01:54:22;"like, Jake should drop an album."
01:54:22;01:54:25;"I wanna see a Jake Longstreth vinyl."
01:54:25;01:54:26;"- That's tight."
01:54:26;01:54:27;"- Have you thought about it?"
01:54:27;01:54:28;"- Yeah, I have songs I've written."
01:54:28;01:54:31;"I just have to get it together to record it with Dick Bix."
01:54:31;01:54:32;"- They'd be the band?"
01:54:32;01:54:33;"- Yeah."
01:54:33;01:54:34;"- Have me and Ariel produce it."
01:54:34;01:54:35;"- Okay."
01:54:35;01:54:36;"- Do two days."
01:54:36;01:54:38;"- Exactly, yeah, do it fast."
01:54:38;01:54:39;"- Two days at Vox."
01:54:39;01:54:41;"We'd like rehearse it for a day or two."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"- Yeah."
01:54:42;01:54:43;"- So everyone knows it and then come in and just crush it."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"- You can take your time with the vocals,"
01:54:44;01:54:46;"but have to get the tracks done."
01:54:46;01:54:47;"- Mountain Bruise, dude."
01:54:47;01:54:48;"- Is that what it's gonna be called?"
01:54:48;01:54:48;"- Yeah."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"- Jake Longstreth, Mountain Bruise?"
01:54:49;01:54:50;"- Mm-hmm."
01:54:50;01:54:51;"- That's great."
01:54:51;01:54:52;"- Coming out in like 2021."
01:54:52;01:54:53;"- Yeah."
01:54:53;01:54:54;"- Like I said, taking my time."
01:54:54;01:54:55;"- How many songs do you have?"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"- Probably like 10."
01:54:57;01:54:57;"- You already have 10."
01:54:57;01:54:59;"- I got Tequila Noon."
01:54:59;01:55:00;"(laughing)"
01:55:00;01:55:02;"I'm blanking on my other song titles."
01:55:02;01:55:03;"Oh, Spring Wind."
01:55:03;01:55:04;"- Love that."
01:55:04;01:55:06;"Sweet Chili Heat, Too Jokey."
01:55:06;01:55:07;"That's for a different project."
01:55:07;01:55:08;"- Yeah, maybe I could rewrite that."
01:55:08;01:55:10;"- Yeah, yeah, like if you could be--"
01:55:10;01:55:11;"- Spring Wind."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"- Instead of Sweet Chili Heat,"
01:55:12;01:55:13;"if you wanted to like class it up,"
01:55:13;01:55:16;"it could be like, kinda like Sweet Desert Heat."
01:55:16;01:55:17;"- Oh yeah."
01:55:17;01:55:18;"- It's about like you driving through Arizona."
01:55:18;01:55:20;"- Or you could do like, you could do one with like--"
01:55:20;01:55:21;"- Sweet Mountain Heat."
01:55:21;01:55:26;"- Or like, like Tequila and Weed."
01:55:26;01:55:27;"You could do kind of like--"
01:55:27;01:55:28;"- Tequila and Weed."
01:55:28;01:55:28;"- You could do like--"
01:55:28;01:55:30;"(laughing)"
01:55:30;01:55:32;"- This would be the second Tequila."
01:55:32;01:55:34;"- Yeah, exactly, exactly."
01:55:34;01:55:35;"- I always think that's kinda cool"
01:55:35;01:55:39;"when like an artist has like a couple interrelated songs"
01:55:39;01:55:41;"and they never explain why."
01:55:41;01:55:44;"It's like Stone Roses have a couple different stone songs."
01:55:44;01:55:44;"- Right."
01:55:44;01:55:46;"- So it's like Jake Longstreet's Mountain Bruise"
01:55:46;01:55:48;"and just like track one, Tequila Noon,"
01:55:48;01:55:50;"track seven, Tequila and Weed."
01:55:50;01:55:51;"- Yeah."
01:55:51;01:55:52;"- It's like, you don't go crazy."
01:55:52;01:55:53;"It's not three songs."
01:55:53;01:55:54;"- Yeah, it's not like--"
01:55:54;01:55:55;"- It's not four, it's just two."
01:55:55;01:55:56;"- Just a theme."
01:55:56;01:55:58;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:55:58;01:55:59;"- All right, well let's table that."
01:55:59;01:56:02;"- Mountain Bruise coming out on Numero Group."
01:56:02;01:56:04;"(laughing)"
01:56:04;01:56:05;"- 2020."
01:56:05;01:56:06;"- Love it."
01:56:06;01:56:09;"- All right, we'll see you guys in two weeks."
01:56:09;01:56:12;"- Time Crisis with Ed's Rocadon."
01:56:12;01:56:13;"Beats."
01:56:13;01:56:16;"One."
01:56:16;01:56:19;"(explosion)"
