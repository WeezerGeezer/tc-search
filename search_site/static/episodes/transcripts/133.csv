00:13;00:16;"This is a very historical episode"
00:16;00:18;"of Time"

00:28;00:30;"With Ezra Koenig."
00:30;00:39;"They passed me by"
00:39;00:42;"All of those great romances"
00:42;00:46;"They were a felt, probably"
00:46;00:49;"All my rightful chances"
00:49;00:52;"My picture clear"
00:52;00:57;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:57;01:00;"And so I dealt you the blow"
01:00;01:03;"One of us had to go"
01:03;01:08;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:08;01:11;"One of us is crying"
01:11;01:14;"One of us is lying"
01:14;01:18;"Leave it on me, babe"
01:18;01:22;"Alright, Time Crisis back once again. What's up, Jake?"
01:22;01:24;"Not a whole lot. I'm just, uh,"
01:25;01:28;"opening up a Wikipedia page for Jolly Ranchers."
01:28;01:32;"Unrelated to Time Crisis."
01:32;01:35;"You were just at home opening up the Wikipedia page, like,"
01:35;01:37;"""Oh, sh*t, we're recording TC right now."""
01:37;01:40;"Yeah, I needed to get the backstory in Jolly Ranchers,"
01:40;01:42;"and I should say I was just on the"
01:42;01:44;"page for Eddie Van Halen."
01:44;01:46;"Rest in peace, Eddie Van Halen."
01:46;01:50;"I feel like we've never talked too much about Van Halen on this show."
01:50;01:52;"I feel like we've joked about, like,"
01:52;01:55;"party bands in, like, SoCal."
01:55;01:58;"And, like, ""These guys are the best band coming out of Pasadena."""
01:58;02:02;"Guys, we talked about Van Halen in episode 89."
02:02;02:04;"It was in the Top 5."
02:04;02:08;"1984, ""Jump"" was the number one song."
02:08;02:10;"So I think that was the only time."
02:10;02:12;"Wait, how did you access? Look at that number crunch."
02:12;02:14;"Yeah, how did you crunch that number?"
02:14;02:18;"You know what, I googled ""Van Halen Jump Time Crisis"""
02:18;02:20;"because I remembered ""Jump"" somehow being on the show."
02:20;02:23;"And thanks to our friends at the TCU Wiki,"
02:23;02:25;"it's all laid out for us."
02:25;02:26;"Wow."
02:26;02:30;"I know we've discussed it, at least in private conversation, Jake,"
02:30;02:33;"because we've talked about your uncle here and there,"
02:33;02:35;"who's a rock musician."
02:35;02:38;"And he grew up in Pasadena, right?"
02:38;02:41;"And he knew David Lee Roth and the Van Halens"
02:41;02:44;"as just, like, some local kids playing in a garage band or something?"
02:44;02:49;"Yeah, the way he tells it, yeah, my Uncle Ted is a Pasadena-based rock musician."
02:49;02:54;"He actually used to play gigs back in the '80s and '90s at the Old Town Pub,"
02:54;02:59;"which, of course, is sort of one of the home venues for Richard Pictures these days."
02:59;03:01;"Or, you know, pre-COVID."
03:01;03:04;"And referenced in a Mountain Bruce song."
03:04;03:08;"""Dead night in Medina at the Old Town Pub."""
03:08;03:11;"Hell yeah. So, Ted, he's told me that, like,"
03:11;03:15;"and who knows how this, you know, like, what's real."
03:15;03:18;"But yeah, he's like, ""Yeah, I saw them play big house parties."""
03:18;03:22;"Like, you know, like, you can picture, like, the Richard Linklater movie."
03:22;03:26;"With, like, the, like, nice tracking shot into, like, the sprawling house."
03:26;03:28;"The parents are away."
03:28;03:30;"And, like, there's dudes set up by the pool."
03:30;03:33;"This, like, opulent, like, Pasadena house."
03:33;03:36;"He said he saw them there. And, like, they would play."
03:36;03:40;"I remember years ago, he was telling me, like, ""Oh, yeah, I knew where they lived."""
03:40;03:42;"And, like, sometimes I'd walk by and, like, watch their practice."
03:42;03:44;"Or, like, hear it, you know?"
03:44;03:49;"I seem to recall reading somewhere that the reason David Lee Roth got to be the singer"
03:49;03:51;"was 'cause he owned a PA."
03:51;03:54;"I love that. I mean, that's pretty high-"
03:54;03:56;"The truth is, he's a wild man."
03:56;03:58;"Obviously, we don't want to make it all about him."
03:58;04:00;"You know, we lost Eddie Van Halen."
04:00;04:05;"But it is funny that, like, I mean, David Lee Roth, it's even by the,"
04:05;04:08;"if you look at all, like, the '80s hair metal bands,"
04:08;04:10;"obviously, they started in the '70s."
04:10;04:13;"I mean, he's like a true American original."
04:13;04:16;"They would sing in this kind of crazy way that suits their music."
04:16;04:19;"And he's just, like, this hilarious personality, wild man."
04:19;04:25;"And then, of course, Eddie Van Halen is, like, truly, just on a technical level,"
04:25;04:28;"nobody sounds like him as a guitarist."
04:28;04:31;"So it is just kind of funny that two dudes in the same town,"
04:31;04:35;"I'm not gonna say David Lee Roth is as good a singer as Eddie Van Halen is at guitar."
04:35;04:37;"That'd be a bit much."
04:37;04:40;"But I'm just saying it's, like, you know, sometimes you get bands"
04:40;04:44;"where there's, like, an Eddie Van Halen and then, like, a few schlubs."
04:44;04:48;"And then eventually, maybe Eddie Van Halen, he moves to Hollywood and he links up."
04:48;04:51;"He finds, like, the crazy singer."
04:51;04:55;"But it's just funny that these dudes just kind of were in, like,"
04:55;04:57;"probably went to the same high school or something."
04:57;04:59;"It works. I mean, I was listening to some today,"
04:59;05:03;"and I was thinking about that exactly, like, Van Halen,"
05:03;05:08;"like a very formally innovative guitar player and a virtuoso, obviously."
05:08;05:13;"But also, Van Halen was a complete, fun, like, party rock band."
05:13;05:14;"Yeah."
05:14;05:16;"And it's interesting how he didn't, yeah, David Lee Roth,"
05:16;05:19;"he didn't find a singer that was, like, could sing, like,"
05:19;05:23;"like some '70s prog band, like, something like the dude from Sticks"
05:23;05:26;"or, like, even, like, a friend from Mercury or something,"
05:26;05:28;"like the singer in, like, Kansas."
05:28;05:32;"Like, he found this, like, dude that was, like, barely made it."
05:32;05:35;"Like, it works so well. It's so perfect for the sound."
05:35;05:38;"But, like, it's shocking that it does work."
05:38;05:42;"Right. And obviously, it didn't work on a personal level, infamously."
05:42;05:43;"Right."
05:43;05:46;"They became one of the best-selling American rock bands of all time"
05:46;05:50;"because they had such extreme flavors in the band."
05:50;05:54;"But it also meant that that formation could not last forever."
05:54;05:57;"And honestly, I can think of two bands that changed singers"
05:57;06:01;"and still did their thing, and it's Van Halen and Black Sabbath."
06:01;06:03;"Yeah, that's a good point."
06:03;06:06;"Van Halen legitimately spanned decades."
06:06;06:10;"Like, right now, in the Sammy Hagar era, early '90s,"
06:10;06:14;"they made, like, a legitimate early '90s rock hit with a different singer,"
06:14;06:18;"like, well over a decade past their, like, full explosion"
06:18;06:20;"as this, like, pop metal thing."
06:20;06:22;"That's a real career. It's amazing."
06:22;06:25;"Were you ever, like, a deep Van Halen fan, Jake?"
06:25;06:27;"No. Not really my thing."
06:27;06:29;"I mean, I enjoyed-- I liked some of the hits."
06:29;06:31;"Like, I threw on the first record today"
06:31;06:33;"when I was driving around running errands."
06:33;06:36;"And, like, yeah, ""Running With the Devil,"" come on."
06:36;06:37;"I know this is lame."
06:37;06:39;"If you're, like, a Van Halen head and you're listening,"
06:39;06:43;"it's like you're a deadhead saying ""Touch of Grey"" is your favorite dead song."
06:43;06:45;"""Jump"" is my favorite Van Halen song."
06:45;06:48;"I understand that that's lame, but that's just where I'm at with it."
06:48;06:53;"No, ""Jump's"" a great song, and that song is very not guitar-centric."
06:53;06:55;"Is there any guitar on it?"
06:55;06:57;"I think there's, like, an insane guitar solo on it."
06:57;07:00;"I can picture in the video, like, Eddie plays the synth at some point, right?"
07:00;07:02;"Yeah, I think so."
07:02;07:05;"Anyway, that's all to say that that was a band that--"
07:05;07:07;"they could do a lot of different things."
07:07;07:09;"It wasn't just, like, every song was, like, ""Eruption,"""
07:09;07:11;"you know, like, crazy shredder guitar."
07:11;07:14;"They could also, like, do, like, a solid synth rock song."
07:14;07:15;"And they spanned the decades."

08:31;08:33;"He said that he never learned how to read music."
08:33;08:37;"But he started out playing piano."
08:37;08:40;"And he would, like, go to classical music competitions or something"
08:40;08:43;"and kind of, like, just play by ear what he heard."
08:43;08:45;"He's just on some other level."
08:45;08:49;"I was reading that he won, like, multiple classical piano competitions"
08:49;08:52;"in Long Beach in, like, the 1960s."
08:52;08:55;"But it didn't even occur to me that, yeah, he wasn't reading music."
08:55;08:56;"That's wild."
08:56;08:58;"Yeah, I guess he just had a hell of an ear."
08:58;09:00;"Also, born in Amsterdam."
09:00;09:02;"Didn't know that."
09:02;09:04;"I mean, I knew that they were Dutch."
09:04;09:07;"I was just like, ""Your last name's Van Halen?"""
09:07;09:11;"I mean, hindsight's 20/20, but it's, like, just the perfect name for a band."
09:11;09:12;"Oh, yeah."
09:12;09:13;"Van Halen."
09:13;09:18;"I wonder if David Lee Roth ever had a feeling about the Van Halen brothers,"
09:18;09:22;"similar to Ray A. Kroc and the McDonald's brothers,"
09:22;09:27;"as we've discussed many times in the McDonald's origin story film ""The Founder."""
09:27;09:30;"There's a climactic scene where Ray Kroc,"
09:30;09:33;"he kind of has to own all the sh-- things he's done to the McDonald's brothers."
09:33;09:36;"And part of his, like, reasoning for why he had to, like,"
09:36;09:39;"fight tooth and nail to build McDonald's empire the way he wanted to"
09:39;09:43;"was, like, ""You guys don't know how good you had your last name."
09:43;09:44;"McDonald's, perfect for a restaurant."
09:44;09:46;"What about me, Ray Kroc?"
09:46;09:49;"What does that make you think of? Kroc is sh--."""
09:49;09:53;"And they're trying to make, like, some kind of statement about America"
09:53;09:57;"and privilege or perceived lack of privilege."
09:57;10:00;"But anyway, I could picture, like, David Lee Roth is such a--"
10:00;10:02;"I guess he punched up his name enough."
10:02;10:07;"If it was just David Roth, that's a tough name for, like,"
10:07;10:09;"an '80s rock god."
10:09;10:13;"David Lee Roth is pretty good, but I can just imagine him being like,"
10:13;10:15;"""My last name's Roth."
10:15;10:18;"What does that make you think of, like, Philip Roth?"
10:18;10:20;"Solid writer, not a rock star."""
10:20;10:23;"""And you guys--and you guys are the Van Halen brothers."
10:23;10:25;"I mean, come on."
10:25;10:27;"You want to know I'm the way I am?"
10:27;10:30;"'Cause I wasn't blessed with a name like that."""
10:30;10:33;"""It also makes me think of a Roth IRA."""
10:33;10:37;"""Right. When you hear my name, it makes you think of a retirement fund,"
10:37;10:40;"the least rock 'n' roll thing ever."
10:40;10:44;"You guys sound freaking badass, Van Halen brothers."""
10:44;10:48;"I did see a lot of outpouring from friends of the show."
10:48;10:53;"I saw CT and Baio both talking about how they tried to learn eruption"
10:53;10:57;"when they were children, like when they were learning to play music,"
10:57;11:00;"and how it made them better musicians."
11:00;11:04;"And I saw, like, a friend of the show, Brian Kopelman,"
11:04;11:07;"weighing in--he's a huge Van Halen head--Steven Hyden."
11:07;11:10;"A lot of friends of the show were really--"
11:10;11:14;"who were definitely Van Halen heads were going in."
11:14;11:18;"I bet. Yeah, I mean, I feel like I've heard Baio talk about eruption in the past."
11:18;11:20;"I mean, can we throw on eruption?"
11:20;11:22;"That's just like a ""diddly-diddly-diddly-diddly,"" right?"
11:22;11:24;"Like, it's just crazy finger tapping."
11:24;11:31;"The first album opens with ""Runnin' with the Devil,"""
11:31;11:33;"then it goes into this."
11:33;11:36;"And then it goes into King's cover, ""You Really Got Me."""
11:37;11:40;"[guitar playing]"
11:40;11:42;"He has such a specific guitar tone."
11:42;11:43;"Yeah."
11:43;11:45;"It's heavy and light at the same time."
11:45;11:48;"It really cuts, but it's not super tame."
11:48;11:50;"It's warm, but it cuts."
11:50;11:51;"Yeah."
11:51;11:53;"It's got body."
11:53;11:56;"[guitar playing]"
12:04;12:06;"That just sounds like a synth to me."
12:06;12:09;"That just sounds like a Moog, where you're like, taking one of those--"
12:09;12:12;"I think Biden should walk out to this song."
12:12;12:14;"[laughs]"
12:14;12:15;"That'd be sick."
12:15;12:17;"He should play it off his iPhone."
12:17;12:20;"[guitar playing]"
12:20;12:28;"Oh, yeah, then he goes, like, full classical."
12:28;12:30;"Yeah."
12:30;12:33;"I can't even imagine trying to learn this."
12:33;12:37;"Well, Jake, you're going to want to drop it about 50% slower."
12:37;12:39;"Start there."
12:39;12:41;"Little by little, work your way up."
12:41;12:43;"You'll have it in about a week."
12:43;12:46;"[guitar playing]"
12:46;12:56;"And then it goes into--"
12:56;12:59;"[vocalizing]"
12:59;13:02;"What an amazing, like, opening to a career."
13:02;13:04;"I guess that's what you want from a debut album,"
13:04;13:06;"just, like, a statement of purpose."
13:06;13:08;"Track one, ""Runnin' With the Devil."""
13:08;13:12;"We're going to talk about the Devil, because we are a metal band."
13:12;13:14;"But we're, like, we're runnin' with the Devil."
13:14;13:15;"It's kind of fun."
13:15;13:18;"You get, like, that right mix of, like, badass but fun."
13:18;13:20;"And then it's, like, what else is this band about?"
13:20;13:23;"And it's, like, ""Eruption,"" shows another side."
13:23;13:25;"And then ""Kings,"" ""You Really Got Me,"""
13:25;13:27;"they did a [bleep]load of covers."
13:27;13:29;"I can't think of a successful rock band who, like,"
13:29;13:32;"did more covers than them as singles."
13:32;13:34;"And I know we've touched on this kind of thing before,"
13:34;13:39;"but, like, again, it's amazing that their first record came out in '78,"
13:39;13:42;"that ""Kings"" song was maybe, what, 12 years old, 13 years old?"
13:42;13:43;"Yeah."
13:43;13:46;"It's so funny, like, how the sound of rock changed so much"
13:46;13:49;"in that 12-, 13-year span."
13:49;13:51;"Because it really is, like--"
13:51;13:53;"It comes in heavy after ""Eruption."""
13:53;13:55;"It's like-- [vocalizing]"
13:55;13:56;"Matt, throw that on."
13:56;14:00;"[rock music]"
14:00;14:02;"That's a huge sound."
14:02;14:03;"Right."
14:03;14:12;"[rock music]"
14:12;14:15;"I mean, yeah, it makes the ""Kings"" version sound like it was, like,"
14:15;14:17;"on, like, an Edison cylinder."
14:17;14:19;"[laughs] Totally."
14:19;14:21;"I bet Daft Punk loves Van Halen."
14:21;14:23;"Oh, interesting. Wait, what's your theory there?"
14:23;14:26;"They had a song that has an ""Eruption""-type guitar solo."
14:26;14:27;"[vocalizing]"
14:27;14:30;"And there's just something, like, so technical and clean about it"
14:30;14:31;"that seems like--"
14:31;14:33;"Right. I hear you."
14:33;14:41;"[rock music]"
14:41;14:43;"Obviously, they saw the '80s coming."
14:43;14:44;"Yeah."
14:44;14:48;"All those little, like, false harmonics and stuff were so funny."
14:48;14:52;"I was also thinking, like, listening to ""Eruption,"""
14:52;14:55;"and, you know, thinking about them as, like, this major development"
14:55;14:58;"in, like, rock technology."
14:58;15:00;"Rock/guacamole technology."
15:00;15:04;"Like, hearing ""Eruption"" makes me think a little bit of, like,"
15:04;15:08;"a Hendrix solo, like ""Star-Spangled Banner"" at Woodstock."
15:08;15:10;"You know, he has some similar, like, dive bombs."
15:10;15:13;"Yeah. Or ""Page."" Yeah."
15:13;15:14;"Yeah, or ""Page."""
15:14;15:17;"And just those guys, their vibe is so, like,"
15:17;15:20;"kind of, like, earthy, comparatively."
15:20;15:23;"It makes me think of, like, cars or something."
15:23;15:25;"Maybe because of his European background."
15:25;15:27;"Not that Holland's especially known for cars,"
15:27;15:31;"but just, like, that vibe of just, like, fine-tuning a technology"
15:31;15:35;"just to make it, like, fly, drop some weight from the chassis,"
15:35;15:38;"and just, like, create this, like, new sound."
15:38;15:41;"It's like the supersonic version of those dudes."
15:41;15:42;"Yeah."
15:42;15:44;"And it's a matter of taste, but it's, like, you can picture him, like,"
15:44;15:47;"studying this and, like--"
15:47;15:49;"Yeah, I don't know. It just makes me think about it."
15:49;15:51;"If you were, like, a rock fan in '78,"
15:51;15:54;"it probably felt a little bit like going to a car show"
15:54;15:57;"and, like, seeing some game-changing new thing"
15:57;16:00;"that could go, like, way faster than even some, like,"
16:00;16:05;"heritage American car and, like, made less noise, you know?"
16:05;16:06;"It's louder but more powerful."
16:06;16:09;"Yeah. Louder, faster."
16:09;16:10;"European engineering."
16:10;16:13;"I was reading today that he got the--"
16:13;16:15;"You know that Led Zeppelin song ""Heartbreaker""?"
16:15;16:18;"There's that part where it's just Jimmy Page soloing"
16:18;16:19;"with no accompaniment."
16:19;16:20;"Kind of."
16:20;16:23;"And, like, Page is doing a lot of, like, hammer-ons and pull-offs"
16:23;16:26;"on, like, a really loud electric guitar."
16:26;16:28;"And then he just, like, took that vibe and just, like,"
16:28;16:30;"kind of what you said, like, streamlined it,"
16:30;16:31;"took it to the next level."
16:31;16:35;"You know what? I'm going to make another bizarre connection"
16:35;16:38;"because I'm also, like, picturing him figuring out"
16:38;16:43;"all this guacamole technology in his garage in Pasadena."
16:43;16:45;"And I'm just like, ""You know what, man?"
16:45;16:48;"He's grown up in the shadow of the jet propulsion laboratory"
16:48;16:50;"in the great state of California."""
16:50;16:53;"It's almost like I see him and his, like, obsession"
16:53;16:55;"with, like, the technical side of music."
16:55;16:58;"I'm like, ""Jet propulsion laboratory,"
16:58;17:01;"Steve Jobs and Wozniak in the garage."
17:01;17:04;"I'm going to throw Eddie Van Halen in as another"
17:04;17:09;"great Californian tech innovator of the 1970s."""
17:09;17:10;"I love it."
17:10;17:11;"You know what I mean?"
17:11;17:12;"Oh, absolutely."
17:12;17:15;"There's very few guitars that I think of that way."
17:15;17:18;"Yeah, probably back then it was, like, an arms race."
17:18;17:23;"Like, the guitar was still, like, the dominant instrument"
17:23;17:25;"of, like, popular music."
17:25;17:28;"And, like, you probably had, like, a Randy Rhoads come out."
17:28;17:31;"It's like every year there was, yeah, it was, like,"
17:31;17:34;"a very techie type of, like, competitive atmosphere."
17:34;17:36;"And then I feel like after Randy Rhoads died,"
17:36;17:38;"like, Ozzy got this other dude who was, like,"
17:38;17:39;"even faster than Randy Rhoads."
17:39;17:42;"Right, and a lot of those guys, like Satriani and Vi,"
17:42;17:46;"like, it ended up going down this dead end of just, like,"
17:46;17:50;"very cold, not very fun, but very accomplished music."
17:50;17:53;"And it's cool that, like, I guess we touched on this before,"
17:53;17:56;"but, like, it's cool that he was able to do both,"
17:56;17:59;"of, like, have this very accomplished technical music,"
17:59;18:02;"but also have it be really fun and, like,"
18:02;18:05;"fun and dumb in a cool way."
18:05;18:08;"Because there's a version of him without the songwriting"
18:08;18:12;"and without the band that coalesced around him and his brother,"
18:12;18:15;"where it's just kind of like your uncle being like,"
18:15;18:18;"""Man, I used to go see this band in Pasadena."""
18:18;18:20;"And actually, the guy still plays at Old Town Pub sometimes."
18:20;18:24;"I swear he's the fastest, most technical guitar player I've ever seen."
18:24;18:25;"Oh, totally."
18:25;18:29;"They cover the kinks a lot, but he'll take these crazy solos."
18:29;18:30;"Just, like, a really solid cover band."
18:30;18:33;"He just could never figure it out what to do besides that."
18:33;18:35;"But, yeah, his name's Eddie Van Halen."
18:35;18:38;"Great guy. I'll bring him by the next Richard Pictures show."
18:38;18:40;"I bet he'd love you guys."
18:40;18:45;"I mean, he wasn't much of a deadhead, but I think he'd like you guys."
18:45;18:49;"Eddie Van Halen just sitting there with a dead cover band."
18:49;18:51;"Just like, ""Whoa, chill, man."""
18:51;18:53;"God, I wonder if Jerry--"
18:53;18:55;"I mean, it begs the question."
18:55;19:02;"It begs the question, did Jerry ever interface or listen to Van Halen?"
19:02;19:04;"Or vice versa."
19:04;19:11;"I mean, you could imagine a Euro-California technician like Eddie Van Halen, maybe--"
19:11;19:15;"It's really lame when people refer to the dead as being sloppy."
19:15;19:18;"Because, first of all, they're really not that sloppy."
19:18;19:22;"There just aren't that many bands where you have access to that much of their live music."
19:22;19:24;"Because, actually, you know what's interesting?"
19:24;19:26;"Jerry started as a technician, too."
19:26;19:30;"Maybe similar to Eddie Van Halen, two California technicians,"
19:30;19:36;"when he played banjo, according to that book I keep referencing, Dark Star, the oral biography,"
19:36;19:43;"he kind of hit the ceiling of just being as technically accomplished of a picker as he could be."
19:43;19:46;"Because bluegrass is incredibly technical music."
19:46;19:51;"Obviously, there's a lot of soul and energy and vibe in bluegrass music,"
19:51;19:56;"but when you see a shredder bluegrass band, that is some Van Halen sh*t."
19:56;20:02;"Bluegrass is up there with metal and classical music for just pure shredding."
20:02;20:07;"And apparently, Jerry, he was known as the best picker in Northern California,"
20:07;20:12;"and part of him moving to guitar was a little bit to challenge himself just to learn something new."
20:12;20:18;"So I believe this is Jerry talking to Fretz magazine in 1985,"
20:18;20:21;"and the question is, ""Do you ever listen to people like Eddie Van Halen?"""
20:21;20:25;"And his response is, ""Not seriously, no, because I can hear what's happening in there."
20:25;20:30;"There isn't much there that interests me. It isn't played with enough deliberateness,"
20:30;20:34;"and it lacks a certain kind of rhythmic elegance that I like music to have,"
20:34;20:41;"that I like notes to have. There's a lot of notes and stuff, but the notes aren't saying much, you know?"
20:41;20:45;"They're a little like clusters. It's a certain kind of music which I understand on one level,"
20:45;20:47;"but it isn't attractive to me."""
20:47;20:52;"Fair. Well, I was saying before, it's lame when people say, ""Oh, the jazz is sloppy, I'm not into that."""
20:52;20:57;"But I could imagine Eddie Van Halen saying that, and he's one of the few people on earth where"
20:57;21:02;"Eddie Van Halen was like, ""I checked out Europe '72. Sloppy as hell. Doesn't interest me."""
21:02;21:05;"You'd have to be like, ""All right, fair. You're Eddie Van Halen."""
21:05;21:15;"Yeah, and he'd be like, ""It doesn't rock. I'm not interested in this Americana blend of country and psych."""
21:15;21:19;"It's not... he's not interested in that."
21:19;21:23;"I think we also, of course, have to note, I'm sure many TC heads know this,"
21:23;21:28;"but Eddie Van Halen also played the guitar solo on ""Beat It"" off Michael Jackson's ""Thriller."""
21:28;21:31;"The legend I've heard is it was the first take."
21:31;21:32;"Crazy."
21:32;21:36;"That could be, you know, apocryphal, but that's the story I've heard."
21:36;21:41;"There's also so few examples of that. I mean, it goes to show that he really wasn't a class of his own,"
21:41;21:46;"but it's like, if you didn't know that, and even if you just kind of recall what that guitar solo sounds like in your head,"
21:46;21:50;"you're like, ""Of course, who else could have played that? It's such a specific sound."""
21:50;21:55;"Can we throw that on? Just like, ""Beat It"" and rub forward to the solo?"
22:31;22:34;"That's shorter than I remember."
22:34;22:35;"Yeah."
22:35;22:42;"I hate to disagree with Jerry, but that solo really is a combination of clusters of notes, technical prowess,"
22:42;22:45;"but I would say that that solo actually says something."
22:45;22:48;"It told a little story, the same way that Jerry would."
22:48;22:52;"You know, it had personality, it had a narrative."
22:52;22:56;"It wasn't just coming in with the crazy arpeggios."
22:56;23:01;"He used them tastefully. He built a little story around them."
23:01;23:04;"And there was a couple of long bends there."
23:04;23:06;"Yeah, such a unique sound."
23:06;23:12;"And I was just thinking, how many examples are there like that of a gigantic pop song"
23:12;23:16;"where they bring in a famous guitarist to add some personality?"
23:16;23:22;"His guitar has as much personality as Michael Jackson's voice does in Quincy's production, all this stuff."
23:22;23:29;"Mine goes to—it's a totally different scenario, but Santana featuring Rob Thomas with ""Smooth."""
23:29;23:37;"That's a big song where it's not just an iconic guitar hook, but you can kind of recall some of the soloing."
23:37;23:43;"Sorry, I just was curious about that ""Beat It"" solo, and I just Googled—I did a little number crunching on my own."
23:43;23:44;"Oh, nice."
23:44;23:48;"Apparently, Michael Jackson had asked Pete Townshend to do it originally."
23:48;23:49;"Whoa."
23:49;23:51;"Who you don't think of as a soloist."
23:51;23:54;"Brilliant songwriter. And, you know, very talented guitarist."
23:54;23:58;"And then Townshend—he couldn't do it, but he recommended Van Halen."
23:58;23:59;"Whoa."
23:59;24:00;"Weird."
24:00;24:07;"I'm on a CNN article that interviews Van Halen about the phone call from Quincy in the whole studio session."
24:07;24:09;"It's pretty fascinating."
24:09;24:13;"Jake, I just texted it to the group. I feel like you should take this."
24:13;24:14;"All right."
24:14;24:20;"Go from, like, CNN, when Quincy rang you up, you thought it was a crank call."
24:20;24:23;"So, CNN—I like the interviewer is CNN."
24:23;24:27;"CNN, when Quincy rang you up, you thought it was a crank call."
24:27;24:30;"Eddie Van Halen, I went off on him."
24:30;24:33;"I went, ""What do you want? You effing so-and-so?"""
24:33;24:37;"And he says, ""Is this Eddie?"" And I said, ""Yeah, what the hell do you want?"""
24:37;24:39;"""This is Quincy."""
24:39;24:42;"I'm thinking to myself, ""I don't know any name Quincy."""
24:42;24:44;"He goes, ""Quincy Jones, man."""
24:44;24:46;"I went, ""Oh, sorry."""
24:46;24:47;"Laughed."
24:47;24:49;"I said, ""What can I do for you?"""
24:49;24:53;"And he said, ""How would you like to come down and play on Michael Jackson's new record?"""
24:53;24:58;"And I'm thinking to myself, ""Okay, ABC, 1, 2, 3, and me. How's that going to work?"""
24:58;25:00;"Oh, because he's thinking of the Jackson 5 stuff."
25:00;25:05;"I mean, Off the Wall had been a huge album a couple years earlier, but all right."
25:05;25:07;"But he was in his own world."
25:07;25:08;"He was in the rock world, yeah."
25:08;25:09;"Exactly."
25:09;25:11;"I still wasn't 100% sure it was him."
25:11;25:15;"I said, ""I'll tell you what. I'll meet you at your studio tomorrow."""
25:15;25:20;"Lo and behold, when I get there, there's Quincy, there's Michael Jackson, and there's Engineers."
25:20;25:22;"They're making records!"
25:22;25:23;"CNN."
25:23;25:27;"Did Quincy give you any direction about what he wanted you to do?"
25:27;25:28;"Van Halen."
25:28;25:32;"Michael left to go across the hall to do some children's speaking record."
25:32;25:34;"I think it was ET or something."
25:34;25:36;"Probably the ET record. I was just thinking that."
25:36;25:37;"Okay."
25:37;25:39;"So I asked Quincy, ""What do you want me to do?"""
25:39;25:40;"And he goes, ""Whatever you want to do."""
25:40;25:42;"And I go, ""Be careful what you say."""
25:42;25:45;"""If you know anything about me, be careful what you say, man."""
25:45;25:47;"""Do anything you want. Don't be crazy."""
25:47;25:51;"I listen to the song and I immediately go, ""Can I change some parts?"""
25:51;25:55;"I turn to the engineer and I go, ""Okay, from the breakdown, chop into this part."
25:55;25:58;"Go into this piece, pre-chorus to the chorus."""
25:58;26:02;"It took him maybe 10 minutes to put it together, and I proceeded to improvise two solos over it."
26:02;26:05;"I was just finishing the second solo when Michael walked in."
26:05;26:07;"And you know artists are kind of crazy people."
26:07;26:09;"We're all a little bit strange."
26:09;26:13;"I didn't know how he would react to what I was doing, so I warned him before he listened."
26:13;26:16;"I said, ""Look, I changed the middle section of your song."""
26:16;26:18;"That's actually kind of crazy."
26:18;26:21;"He walks in and he's like, ""Can we actually just shift the structure around?"""
26:21;26:23;"Just commandeering the whole studio."
26:23;26:27;"I'm amazed that that only took 10 minutes in 1981, too."
26:27;26:29;"Yeah, with tape."
26:29;26:30;"No problem, Eddie."
26:30;26:36;"So he continues, ""Now in my mind, he's either going to have his bodyguards kick me out for butchering his song or he's going to like it."""
26:36;26:45;"He gave it a listen, and he turned to me and he said, ""Wow, thank you so much for having the passion not to come in and blaze a solo, but to actually care about the song and
make it better."""
26:45;26:46;"Wow."
26:46;26:49;"""He was a musical genius with his childlike innocence."
26:49;26:52;"He was such a professional and such a sweetheart."""
26:52;26:55;"Wait, now he's talking about Nirvana? Hold on."
26:55;26:58;"Is there an album since then that has shaken things up in the same way?"
26:58;27:00;"Oh, I don't know. CNN."
27:00;27:04;"Some people cite Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" as one that has caused a musical shift."
27:04;27:07;"Van Halen. But still not like that."
27:07;27:11;"Not that it crossed over to such a mass audience. Nirvana was huge, but it didn't appeal to everyone."
27:11;27:13;"Anyway, whatever. That's not that interesting."
27:13;27:16;"Wait, now he's comparing Nirvana to Michael Jackson?"
27:16;27:24;"No, no, no. CNN went into this thing of how Thriller was this huge record and everyone loved it."
27:24;27:32;"And then CNN was trying to fish a little bit and was like, ""Well, what else do you think has changed music? What about Nirvana?"""
27:32;27:35;"And Van Halen is sort of like, ""Yes."""
27:35;27:40;"""They're playing punk rock, man."" To quote Uncle Ted."
27:40;27:45;"Yeah, and you can imagine why just some punk rock might not be that appealing to Eddie Van Halen."
27:45;27:46;"Yeah."
27:46;27:51;"Well, R.I.P. Eddie Van Halen. Hell of a career."
27:51;27:52;"Rest in power."
27:52;27:55;"Right. We were talking on the thread. Seinfeld, you brought this up."
27:55;27:58;"It seems like everybody says ""rest in power"" these days."
27:58;28:04;"I feel like I've noticed this year that ""Rest in Peace"" is not cool. It's out. Now it's ""Rest in Power."""
28:04;28:08;"My guess on the thread was, because you were saying, ""Where does this come from?"""
28:08;28:16;"I mean, it really sounds like, I would have guessed it might have its roots in the Black Panther era of African-American activism."
28:16;28:23;"Then we found some article that said it didn't go back that far, but still implied that it kind of came from Black activism."
28:23;28:32;"And as a lot of words do, become appropriated by it. Such as the word ""woke"" also kind of came from a smaller niche."
28:32;28:39;"And suddenly everybody talks about it. But yeah, ""rest in power"" really seems like a political thing."
28:39;28:47;"Race aside, because I don't know exactly where it comes from, it does seem like way more, you know, it sounds like when Nelson Mandela dies."
28:47;28:54;"""Rest in Power."" I feel like the implication is like, somebody who was dedicated to a struggle for equal rights or something."
28:54;28:59;"You know, the idea of just saying, ""Rest in Peace, take it easy now."" It's like, no, no."
28:59;29:04;"Power feels more appropriate because you were looking for power for the people, you know?"
29:04;29:06;"You're struggling not over."
29:06;29:10;"It feels kind of like, you're still giving them hell in the afterlife."
29:10;29:15;"Like, your power sustains, you know, beyond the grave."
29:15;29:22;"Especially when you consider the long history, obviously, of activists being murdered and killed by the powers that be."
29:22;29:27;"It's important to recognize that just because somebody's dead doesn't mean the struggle's over."
29:27;29:32;"It is strange that now people seem to use it for literally everybody who dies."
29:32;29:37;"Although weirdly, I would say with Eddie Van Halen, it makes me think of power chords."
29:37;29:40;"At least he came from the world of metal."
29:40;29:42;"Very powerful tone."
29:42;29:45;"At least his life was associated with power in a way."
29:45;29:48;"Is power metal a thing? I'm gonna do a number crunch."
29:48;29:49;"Power metal."
29:49;29:57;"Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional heavy metal with speed metal, often with some phonic context."
29:57;29:59;"Who are the big power metal bands?"
29:59;30:05;"I guess they're saying Queensryche and Fate's Warning were progressive metal bands."
30:05;30:11;"And then they influenced bands like Manowar, Vicious Rumors, Virgin Steel, Riot, or Jagged Panzer."
30:11;30:14;"Oh yeah. Love those bands."
30:14;30:16;"Halloween, Running Wild."
30:16;30:23;"Okay, but either way, power seems like an appropriate word to associate with Eddie Van Halen."
30:23;30:25;"Speaking of metal, Peace sells."
30:25;30:27;"But who's buying?"
30:27;30:29;"Wait, Jake, do you know what that is?"
30:29;30:32;"Uh, remind me."
30:32;30:36;"It's an album from 1986 called Peace Sells. Dot, dot, dot."
30:36;30:38;"But who's buying?"
30:38;30:40;"Is it a metal record?"
30:40;30:42;"It's an American heavy metal band."
30:42;30:44;"Do I know the name of the band? Are they famous?"
30:44;30:45;"Yes."
30:45;30:49;"I'm not a metal guy. It's not Slayer, because I know they did Rain and Blood in '86."
30:49;30:53;"This band's first album came out in 1985, and it also had an ellipsis."
30:53;30:56;"It was called Killing is My Business, dot, dot, dot."
30:56;30:58;"And business is good."
30:58;31:00;"Oh my god."
31:00;31:02;"They're so focused on commerce."
31:02;31:04;"It's not Queensryche, right?"
31:04;31:05;"No."
31:05;31:10;"And then their third album is called So Far, Comma, So Good, dot, dot, dot."
31:10;31:11;"So what?"
31:11;31:12;"Oh my god."
31:12;31:15;"Their fourth album is called Rust in Peace, 1990."
31:15;31:18;"Their fifth album, 1992, is called Countdown to Extinction."
31:18;31:19;"Oh, Megadeth."
31:19;31:21;"Yeah, Megadeth."
31:21;31:23;"Megadeth."
31:23;31:26;"Oh my god, those first two album titles are so brutal."
31:26;31:28;"I don't know why that I've always--"
31:28;31:30;"You know what, I gotta go listen to this album."
31:30;31:34;"I feel like there's a lot of things that seem very appealing to me about Megadeth."
31:34;31:36;"One of the most psychotic band names."
31:36;31:40;"What's the top played Megadeth song on Apple Music?"
31:40;31:43;"I can't even name one Megadeth song."
31:43;31:44;"Can you?"
31:44;31:46;"No, but I can sing one."
31:46;31:50;"I can sing one bass line because they always used to use this as a bumper on MTV."
31:50;31:54;"And it went, ""Bow, ba-dow, bow, bow, ba-dow, ba-dow, bow, ba-dow, bow, bow, ba-dow, ba-dow."""
31:54;31:58;"And I would hear that growing up because they would use it for MTV News."
31:58;32:00;"""Bow, ba-dow, bow, bow, ba-dow, ba-dow."""
32:00;32:03;"And then finally I heard it and I was like, ""Oh, it's a Megadeth song. Sick."""
32:03;32:06;"What's the top played Megadeth song on Apple Music?"
32:06;32:11;"""Killing is my business."""
32:11;32:13;"""Business is good."""
32:13;32:16;"""Terrible."""
32:16;32:29;"Oh my God."
32:29;32:31;"What year is this?"
32:31;32:33;"That vocal texture is so buff."
32:33;32:35;"This is from '92."
32:35;32:40;"God, this sucks."
32:40;32:43;"I'm not that mad at it."
32:43;32:45;"It's awful."
32:45;32:47;"I mean, it's kind of interesting."
32:47;32:54;"Bands like Alice in Chains and Soundgarden were just miles beyond these guys."
32:54;32:58;"I can hear a little bit of Alice in Chains in there, but Alice in Chains could write songs and sing."
32:58;33:02;"Well, hold on. You're just basing that off one Megadeth song."
33:02;33:06;"Okay, let's turn this into a Megadeth episode. Fans would love that."
33:06;33:10;"Play the title track off Peace Sells, but who's buying?"
33:10;33:12;"Play track three, Peace Sells."
33:12;33:14;"That's the one that I know."
33:14;33:19;"I'm into this. Do you remember this? They always play this on MTV."
33:36;33:38;"This kind of sounds like Primus."
33:38;33:40;"This is so Beavis and Butthead."
33:40;33:42;"Oh yeah, it's so Beavis and Butthead."
33:42;33:44;"Vocals are so low in the mix."
33:44;33:46;"What do you mean?"
33:46;33:48;"I like this."
33:56;33:58;"I'd put this on the two Megadeth."
33:58;33:59;"Hell yeah."
33:59;34:01;"Peace Sells, but who's buying? I love that title."
34:01;34:07;"Anyway, I hope there are no hardcore Van Halen fans who hate Megadeth."
34:07;34:10;"I don't know if that's offensive to a Van Halen fan to get into Megadeth."
34:10;34:14;"Or maybe there's some shared fandom."
34:14;34:20;"Jake, before we started paying tribute to the absolute legend Eddie Van Halen,"
34:20;34:25;"you said that you had the Wikipedia cracked open for Jolly Ranchers."
34:25;34:26;"That is true."
34:26;34:28;"I don't know about you guys."
34:28;34:32;"I feel like lately we've been referencing the thread a lot on this show."
34:32;34:34;"We've been doing this show for a long time now."
34:34;34:37;"It's okay to peel back the curtain a little bit."
34:37;34:41;"We're going to have a friend of the show, Daniel Ralston, on."
34:41;34:43;"I believe for the first time actually on air."
34:43;34:44;"I think so, yeah."
34:44;34:49;"He's going to be giving us a review of the new Hershey's/Yingling beer."
34:49;34:53;"We don't have bottles ourselves. We'll be trying that subsequently."
34:53;34:56;"But on the thread, I asked if we could hit up our--"
34:56;35:00;"now that we have a great contact at Hershey's,"
35:00;35:03;"I asked if they could hook us up with this new Hershey's beer."
35:03;35:04;"And they said okay."
35:04;35:08;"And then Matt, our producer, sent us a picture of a sneaker and said,"
35:08;35:10;"""And also they'd like to send you guys these."
35:10;35:15;"These are the Kawhi Leonard Jolly Rancher New Balances."
35:15;35:20;"As always, in 2020 a collab needs three participants."
35:20;35:22;"Two is boring."""
35:22;35:26;"So we have the NBA star Kawhi Leonard, the sneaker company New Balance,"
35:26;35:28;"and Jolly Rancher."
35:28;35:29;"And I don't know about you guys,"
35:29;35:33;"but before I could take in the breathtaking beauty of the sneaker,"
35:33;35:37;"my first thought was, ""Wait, does Hershey's own Jolly Ranchers?"""
35:37;35:38;"I didn't know that."
35:38;35:41;"And I feel like the Jolly Ranchers branding, you don't think--"
35:41;35:44;"right? Like, Hershey's just seems like a chocolate company."
35:44;35:48;"You don't think about it being fruit-flavored lozenges."
35:48;35:52;"It'd be like if Hershey's sold-- like, owned Skittles."
35:52;35:54;"It'd be like, ""What?"""
35:54;35:55;"Yeah, especially because--"
35:55;35:56;"What the f***?"
35:56;35:57;"[laughter]"
35:57;35:59;"Rare F-bomb from the South."
35:59;36:02;"I'm sorry, but it would be upsetting."
36:02;36:05;"I think especially because, like most people,"
36:05;36:08;"you know, most people want to keep their chocolate candy"
36:08;36:10;"separate from their fruity candy."
36:10;36:12;"I can think of a few weird things."
36:12;36:14;"I feel like growing up in my grandparents' house,"
36:14;36:18;"they always had, like, chocolate-covered orange peel kind of candy."
36:18;36:19;"Gross."
36:19;36:21;"And it's definitely not for everybody."
36:21;36:23;"And I feel like that's a thing you hear a lot."
36:23;36:25;"People say, ""I don't like my chocolate and my fruit mixed up."
36:25;36:27;"I'm disgusted by it."""
36:27;36:28;"Big time."
36:28;36:30;"And I even-- is this-- Seinfeld, is this like a meme or something?"
36:30;36:32;"Or is this like a prank?"
36:32;36:34;"You take a big thing of Skittles and a big thing of M&M's"
36:34;36:36;"and you mix them up in a bowl?"
36:36;36:40;"I saw one tweet about that, weirdly enough, last week."
36:40;36:42;"And I think the phrase was,"
36:42;36:47;"""My aunt mixed M&M's and Skittles and it's the most chaotic."""
36:47;36:49;"You know how people say chaotic now?"
36:49;36:52;"Like, ""The most chaotic evil I've ever seen."""
36:52;36:54;"""The most chaotic evil I've ever seen."""
36:54;36:55;"Something like that."
36:55;36:57;"I've never-- I haven't seen it replicated,"
36:57;37:00;"but maybe there was one single sort of mega tweet about that."
37:00;37:02;"This is a thing. I think it goes back years."
37:02;37:05;"Maybe it's also just for the average American child"
37:05;37:07;"of a certain age, perhaps."
37:07;37:09;"I don't know if kids still eat candy."
37:09;37:12;"But the idea of mixing up Skittles and M&M's"
37:12;37:14;"is just, like, so disturbing--"
37:14;37:17;"-Gross. ---to a red-blooded American kid."
37:17;37:20;"Can I read you one sentence off this Wikipedia page"
37:20;37:22;"that I think is so indicative of, like,"
37:22;37:24;"kind of late capitalist situation?"
37:24;37:26;"-Sure. -There's a--"
37:26;37:28;"called ""Acquisitions"""
37:28;37:30;"on the Jolly Rancher Wikipedia page."
37:30;37:32;"And it's one sentence long, and it says,"
37:32;37:36;"""In 2002, Hershey closed the Wheat Ridge, Colorado plant"
37:36;37:39;"and moved the manufacturing of the candy to Mexico"
37:39;37:40;"to save costs."""
37:40;37:42;"Wow."
37:42;37:46;"'Cause it was founded in Golden, Colorado in 1949."
37:46;37:49;"-So from 1949 to 2002, -Whoa."
37:49;37:51;"Jolly Ranchers were made in the USA"
37:51;37:53;"in Colorado."
37:53;37:55;"Wait, is Golden, Colorado also where, like,"
37:55;37:57;"Coors is from or some beer company?"
37:57;37:59;"Coors is definitely from that region of the world."
37:59;38:01;"I don't know if it's ""Golden."""
38:01;38:04;"That's right. You're right. It is Coors."
38:04;38:07;"Whoa, Golden, Colorado is like the Silicon Valley"
38:07;38:09;"of beer and candy."
38:09;38:11;"That's two pretty big things"
38:11;38:13;"to be-- come out of one town."
38:13;38:15;"Well, I also think that I'm--"
38:15;38:17;"if I'm recalling my research from years ago,"
38:17;38:19;"I want to say Wild Oats"
38:19;38:21;"came from Golden, Colorado."
38:21;38:23;"Wild Oats was the, like, competitor to Whole Foods"
38:23;38:25;"for a good 20 years,"
38:25;38:27;"and then Whole Foods eventually bought them."
38:27;38:29;"I'm gonna take this all the way."
38:29;38:31;"That's correct."
38:31;38:33;"Wow. Wait, so what is--"
38:33;38:35;"is Golden, Colorado just, like, a suburb of Denver?"
38:35;38:37;"Yes. I think it's, like--"
38:37;38:39;"it is adjacent to Denver,"
38:39;38:41;"but I think there's, like, a cool college there."
38:41;38:43;"-Oh. -And I think it's, like,"
38:43;38:45;"-a little bit of, like-- -It's a former Gold Rush town."
38:45;38:47;"It's a mountain town, right."
38:47;38:49;"I think it's maintained some degree"
38:49;38:51;"of, like, hippie crunchiness."
38:51;38:53;"Yeah, I mean, you hear so much about Boulger."
38:53;38:55;"-Yes. -Yeah, it looks like"
38:55;38:57;"it is part of Greater Denver."
38:57;38:59;"I've been to Denver many times, but it's always on tour,"
38:59;39:01;"so, like, I rarely get to"
39:01;39:03;"kind of explore Greater Denver."
39:03;39:05;"It's a fascinating area."
39:05;39:07;"It's also always amazed me how, um,"
39:07;39:09;"when, uh, Red Rocks,"
39:09;39:11;"which is in Morrison, Colorado,"
39:11;39:13;"and, you know, anybody's ever been to Red Rocks"
39:13;39:15;"or even seen pictures, it's, like,"
39:15;39:17;"one of the most, like,"
39:17;39:19;"breathtaking venues in America."
39:19;39:21;"-Yeah. -You know, carved into this rock."
39:21;39:23;"You're in, like, this, I think, a state park,"
39:23;39:25;"but it's, like, amazing. You're, like,"
39:25;39:27;"as far as the eye can see, it's, like, this kind of,"
39:27;39:29;"like, beautiful, rugged terrain,"
39:29;39:31;"and, you know, usually"
39:31;39:33;"when we play at Red Rocks, we, like, stay in Denver,"
39:33;39:35;"you know, like, jump in a van,"
39:35;39:37;"and we're, like, there in, like, 35 minutes."
39:37;39:39;"-Mm-hmm. -And it's really wild"
39:39;39:41;"'cause, like, yeah, the Red Rocks,"
39:41;39:43;"whatever the beautiful outdoor"
39:43;39:45;"natural amphitheater of a lot"
39:45;39:47;"of cities might be hours outside."
39:47;39:49;"Right. That's cool."
39:49;39:51;"But clearly,"
39:51;39:53;"gold in Colorado is where it's at."
39:53;39:55;"Jay, did you find anything else out about Jolly Ranchers?"
39:55;39:57;"When did they start making them?"
39:57;39:59;"1949."
39:59;40:01;"Bill and Dorothy Harmsman"
40:01;40:03;"founded the company."
40:03;40:05;"They wanted to give the impression"
40:05;40:07;"of it being a friendly Western company."
40:07;40:09;"Okay."
40:09;40:11;"And also, it's a rancher. -Yeah."
40:11;40:13;"-That implies the West, right? -Yeah."
40:13;40:15;"-Like, you know, if it had been founded in"
40:15;40:17;"1907 in Connecticut,"
40:17;40:19;"it might be called, like, the Happy Farmer."
40:19;40:21;"But this was founded in a gold rush town"
40:21;40:23;"out in the Rockies."
40:23;40:25;"So it was a Jolly Rancher."
40:25;40:27;"I can give you a little breakdown of the chemistry, if you'd like."
40:27;40:29;"Yeah, the technology."
40:29;40:31;"Oh, yeah, please. Let's get into the tech."
40:31;40:33;"Okay. Well, they're amorphous solids, meaning their"
40:33;40:35;"molecular arrangements have no specific pattern."
40:35;40:37;"They are hard..."
40:37;40:39;"Of course."
40:39;40:41;"...rigid, translucent, and have low molecular"
40:41;40:43;"mobility. Jolly Ranchers"
40:43;40:45;"are formed from highly concentrated sugar"
40:45;40:47;"solutions, greater than 95%"
40:47;40:49;"sugar, and have extremely high viscosity."
40:49;40:51;"Their glassy appearance is a result"
40:51;40:53;"of the way they are processed."
40:53;40:55;"During processing, the sugar syrup is"
40:55;40:57;"cooled so rapidly that no crystals"
40:57;40:59;"have time to form."
40:59;41:01;"Jolly Ranchers hold their shape"
41:01;41:03;"and are kept in temperatures less than the glass transition"
41:03;41:05;"temperature. If the temperature is"
41:05;41:07;"greater than the glass transition temperature,"
41:07;41:09;"the hard and glassy-like structure of the"
41:09;41:11;"Jolly Rancher will break down and become soft"
41:11;41:13;"and rubbery. -Hmm."
41:13;41:15;"-So, a little, you know, chemistry background there."
41:15;41:17;"[laughter]"
41:17;41:19;"-Isn't Jolly Rancher"
41:19;41:21;"like a primary ingredient in drink?"
41:21;41:23;"-Oh, yeah. There is a thing where people would, like,"
41:23;41:25;"melt Jolly Ranchers and use it"
41:25;41:27;"to make alcohol."
41:27;41:29;"-Well, I can tell you that, um,"
41:29;41:31;"something that, uh,"
41:31;41:33;"is very popular on TikTok"
41:33;41:35;"that my kids are very into"
41:35;41:37;"is a viral video where people"
41:37;41:39;"prank other people by boiling"
41:39;41:41;"the Jolly Ranchers down,"
41:41;41:43;"putting someone's phone inside of them"
41:43;41:45;"to make a giant Jolly Rancher"
41:45;41:47;"and then putting it into the freezer."
41:47;41:49;"So, their phone is now"
41:49;41:51;"trapped in a giant Jolly Rancher."
41:51;41:53;"-Does it ruin the phone?"
41:53;41:55;"-It ruins the phone."
41:55;41:57;"[laughter]"
41:57;41:59;"-So, the prank is destroying people's phones?"
41:59;42:01;"-Yeah. It would be a sick"
42:01;42:03;"prank if it didn't ruin the phone"
42:03;42:05;"and you had to, like, eat."
42:05;42:07;"-Hammer through or eat through this giant Jolly Rancher."
42:07;42:09;"-Yeah, no. It would be sick if it -- maybe it doesn't"
42:09;42:11;"always ruin the phone. If you could see through"
42:11;42:13;"the translucent, amorphous,"
42:13;42:15;"molecular structure and you could see"
42:15;42:17;"that your phone was working and, in fact,"
42:17;42:19;"you see you're getting texted"
42:19;42:21;"and you're like, ""Uh,"" and you want to bust"
42:21;42:23;"it and you're like, ""Hold on a second."
42:23;42:25;"If you grab a hammer or you throw this"
42:25;42:27;"against the, you know, the f---ing corner"
42:27;42:29;"of the table, you might break your phone."""
42:29;42:31;"And it's like, ""Well, how do I get to this s---?"""
42:31;42:33;"And it's like, ""Start licking."" -That would be a sick"
42:33;42:35;"prank. -We got to figure out a way to do this"
42:35;42:37;"prank where it doesn't destroy the phone. -Well, I think"
42:37;42:39;"that there's a version where you just"
42:39;42:41;"put it inside a Ziploc."
42:41;42:43;"-It's sort of the safer way to do it."
42:43;42:45;"And I would imagine it keeps it working."
42:45;42:47;"I don't think freezing a phone"
42:47;42:49;"hurts it. Does it? Obviously,"
42:49;42:51;"the heat, you know, can"
42:51;42:53;"turn it off, but... -They're like molten"
42:53;42:55;"Jolly Ranchers, what destroys the phone."
42:55;42:57;"[laughter]"
42:57;42:59;"Cool prank. ""Hey, Ezra, I stole your phone."""
42:59;43:01;"-""Start licking."" [laughter]"
43:01;43:03;"-""I stole your phone and I put it"
43:03;43:05;"in my Vitamix, and"
43:05;43:07;"now I just sprinkled it in with these"
43:07;43:09;"eggs. I made you an omelette of"
43:09;43:11;"your phone."" [laughter]"
43:11;43:13;"[laughter]"
43:15;43:17;"-The phone is destroyed. -It's broken now, you can't"
43:17;43:19;"use your phone anymore."
43:19;43:21;"-The phone is destroyed."

44:13;44:14;"it's time to get on the phone"
44:14;44:16;"with friend of the show, Daniel Ralston."
44:16;44:20;"As you'll recall, he has the Hershey's Yingling beer"
44:20;44:22;"in his possession."
44:22;44:24;"Also, it was his great call to do a country top five"
44:24;44:26;"on the last episode."
44:26;44:29;"So let's get him on the horn and see what he has to say."
44:29;44:32;"- Are we sure that he has the beer in his possession?"
44:32;44:33;"- Yes, I believe so."
44:33;44:34;"Well, we're about to find out."
44:34;44:37;"- And he posted like a stock photo of it."
44:37;44:38;"- Okay, well, great."
44:38;44:39;"Plenty to talk about."
44:39;44:42;"- Now, let's go into the Time Crisis Hotline."
44:42;44:45;"(phone ringing)"
44:45;44:47;"- Hello."
44:47;44:49;"- Daniel."
44:49;44:49;"- Hi."
44:49;44:51;"- Welcome to the show."
44:51;44:53;"Okay, right off the bat, first question."
44:53;44:56;"Do you have the Hershey's beer in your possession?"
44:56;44:57;"- I have the Hershey's beer in my possession."
44:57;44:59;"- Oh, okay."
44:59;45:00;"- Beautiful."
45:00;45:02;"- A few questions first,"
45:02;45:05;"because you're the one who put this on our radar."
45:05;45:08;"So this came to you via your family"
45:08;45:10;"or did you already know about it?"
45:10;45:13;"- I saw something about it in my like random Google News feed"
45:13;45:16;"and they were advertising it as 300 years"
45:16;45:17;"of Pennsylvania history"
45:17;45:20;"because both Hershey's and Yangling have been around"
45:20;45:23;"for like 150 plus years."
45:23;45:25;"And I called my parents and I said,"
45:25;45:26;"""Can you find this for me?"
45:26;45:27;"""I wanna try it."""
45:27;45:30;"And my dad was like, ""I already saw it at Wegmans."
45:30;45:33;"""It's being pushed very hard at the grocery store."""
45:33;45:34;"So he sent me some right away."
45:34;45:36;"- You're from Pennsylvania, right?"
45:36;45:37;"- Yeah, I'm from Allentown."
45:37;45:42;"- Growing up, did Hershey's and Yangling loom large for you?"
45:42;45:44;"- Yeah, I probably went to Hershey Park"
45:44;45:45;"like 30 times as a kid."
45:45;45:48;"It's like an hour and a half from where I grew up."
45:48;45:50;"I saw some of my first concerts there,"
45:50;45:54;"including Dave Matthews Band in 1994."
45:54;45:57;"- 'Cause they have like an amphitheater at Hershey Park?"
45:57;45:58;"- They do."
45:58;46:00;"Actually, it's one of the famous shows"
46:00;46:02;"that Radiohead opened for Alanis Morissette"
46:02;46:03;"was at Hershey Park."
46:03;46:06;"- So you're telling me Tom York has been to Hershey PA."
46:06;46:08;"- He's been to Hershey PA for sure."
46:08;46:11;"- I wonder if Radiohead got the VIP factory tour."
46:11;46:12;"- There's a song they play on the factory tour"
46:12;46:13;"that's pretty legendary."
46:13;46:16;"I hope they worked it into one of their songs later."
46:16;46:17;"- What are some of the lyrics?"
46:17;46:20;"It's like an original composition about Hershey's?"
46:20;46:24;"♪ Hershey's chocolate's a Hershey's chocolate world ♪"
46:24;46:26;"♪ Wherever you go, no matter how far ♪"
46:26;46:31;"♪ You're always near a Hershey bar ♪"
46:31;46:32;"- Okay, that's pretty good."
46:32;46:33;"- Yeah."
46:33;46:37;"- And have you ever tasted like a hot off the presses"
46:37;46:39;"Reese's peanut butter cup?"
46:39;46:42;"- No, I haven't."
46:42;46:43;"One time I did the tour"
46:43;46:46;"and one of the big draws of the Hershey Park tour"
46:46;46:48;"is that they give you like a full-size candy bar"
46:48;46:49;"at the end."
46:49;46:50;"This is probably the last time I went."
46:50;46:52;"It was like in the mid nineties"
46:52;46:56;"and they gave me a desert storm bar,"
46:56;46:58;"which was the candy bar created"
46:58;47:00;"to withstand high temperatures."
47:00;47:02;"- Oh, wait, I feel like this briefly came up"
47:02;47:04;"when we were researching that,"
47:04;47:06;"'cause you know, Reese's peanut butter cups"
47:06;47:09;"have different formulas in the summer and winter."
47:09;47:12;"And I feel like this came up at some time in our research."
47:12;47:13;"I don't think we really talked about it too much"
47:13;47:14;"on the show."
47:14;47:16;"So this was during the Gulf War,"
47:16;47:19;"even the American summer formula wasn't enough"
47:19;47:23;"to withstand that real intense Iraqi heat."
47:23;47:24;"- Exactly."
47:24;47:27;"And I remember it came in like a tan wrapper,"
47:27;47:29;"you know, it had like a military look."
47:29;47:30;"- Yeah."
47:30;47:31;"Did it say like desert storm bar?"
47:31;47:33;"- That's what it was called, I'm pretty sure."
47:33;47:36;"- When I typed in desert storm Hershey bar,"
47:36;47:38;"the first thing that comes up on Google"
47:38;47:41;"is one for sale on eBay."
47:41;47:46;"They're asking for $24.95 plus $3.50 shipping."
47:46;47:48;"It says condition used."
47:48;47:49;"(laughs)"
47:49;47:50;"I'm like, that means."
47:50;47:52;"And it ships from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania."
47:52;47:53;"- Nice."
47:53;47:55;"- Did it cross your mind as a kid when they gave you that?"
47:55;47:56;"Weren't you kind of like,"
47:56;47:59;"I really think this should be with a soldier"
47:59;48:00;"in Iraq right now."
48:00;48:03;"Like, why did they have them back home?"
48:03;48:05;"- I was more concerned with the fact"
48:05;48:08;"that I wanted a new candy bar that had recently come out"
48:08;48:10;"that had M&Ms inside of a chocolate bar."
48:10;48:12;"And I got the desert storm bar instead."
48:12;48:14;"And I just remember being super disappointed"
48:14;48:16;"and putting it straight in the trash,"
48:16;48:19;"which might be the most disrespectful thing to the troops."
48:19;48:21;"(laughs)"
48:21;48:22;"- You should have mailed it."
48:22;48:24;"Whoa, oh my God."
48:24;48:26;"Also looking on eBay."
48:26;48:28;"I love that a significant element of time crisis now"
48:28;48:30;"is just listening to people look at eBay."
48:30;48:32;"(laughs)"
48:32;48:38;"But I found, okay, so that was one for $35."
48:38;48:39;"Here's one, it's in California."
48:39;48:41;"So it'll get there faster."
48:41;48:45;"This is a lot of 33 1991 Hershey's Desert Bar"
48:45;48:46;"Gulf War chocolates."
48:46;48:49;"They're asking $585."
48:49;48:51;"But if you use PayPal credit,"
48:51;48:53;"you can do $51 a month for 12 months."
48:53;48:56;"- Do I only get a certain number for month two as I pay"
48:56;48:58;"or do I get them all at once?"
48:58;48:59;"- Oh, if the seller's smart,"
48:59;49:00;"they won't give you them all at once."
49:00;49:03;"- Those are 29 year old candy bars."
49:03;49:05;"Yeah, made to withstand the elements."
49:05;49:08;"- Ooh, here's one that's in the actual box."
49:08;49:11;"""Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm"
49:11;49:13;"both ended before Hershey was even done"
49:13;49:15;"producing the desert bars."
49:15;49:19;"Only 144,000 bars even made it to the Middle East."
49:19;49:23;"It sold the defunct MREs as novelty items"
49:23;49:24;"until the supplies ran out"
49:24;49:27;"and then discontinued the bar entirely."""
49:27;49:27;"- Whoa."
49:27;49:30;"- Is there a 2003 Iraq War bar?"
49:30;49:33;"- Just bring them back with a new label."
49:33;49:33;"- Right."
49:33;49:36;"- Okay, now I'm remembering how somebody sent us an email."
49:36;49:38;"Apologies to whoever sent us this email."
49:38;49:40;"Seinfeld, maybe do a number crunch."
49:40;49:41;"Who sent us the email about Hershey's"
49:41;49:43;"making bars for the military?"
49:43;49:45;"'Cause as I go deeper,"
49:45;49:47;"now I'm seeing World War II era Hershey's bars"
49:47;49:50;"that were branded as Hershey's Tropical Chocolate"
49:50;49:53;"that also they were probably sending to, you know,"
49:53;49:56;"like the Pacific Theater, maybe North Africa."
49:56;49:58;"And these say tropical on..."
49:58;50:00;"So I guess there's a long history of Hershey's"
50:00;50:03;"changing their formula to send to the troops"
50:03;50:05;"fighting in hot places."
50:05;50:08;"- Wait, so Daniel, have you tried the Hershey's Yingling?"
50:08;50:11;"- No, I was saving it for time crisis."
50:11;50:12;"- Oh, you haven't taken a sip yet."
50:12;50:15;"Let's move on from the military chocolate industrial complex."
50:15;50:17;"- Wait, wait, wait, I do want to say,"
50:17;50:19;"I want to say, no, no, no."
50:19;50:21;"Just because you asked, just because you asked,"
50:21;50:23;"Kevin Paschall is his name."
50:23;50:26;"And I only feel urgently that I should say,"
50:26;50:28;"because this was just an incredible email."
50:28;50:30;"It was just one of those like thousand word bangers"
50:30;50:34;"that gets into like this whole anthropological background."
50:34;50:36;"It's worth reading maybe at some point, but not today."
50:36;50:37;"Anyway."
50:37;50:38;"- All right, shout out to Kevin."
50:38;50:40;"Is there anything we missed?"
50:40;50:42;"- We're never going to get to it later."
50:42;50:43;"This was a tough one."
50:43;50:44;"(laughing)"
50:44;50:46;"- I mean, did you talk about"
50:46;50:49;"Army quartermaster Colonel Paul Logan?"
50:49;50:50;"- No, is this his idea?"
50:50;50:52;"- Yeah, he asked Hershey to develop a bar"
50:52;50:56;"that was four ounces, able to withstand high temperatures,"
50:56;51:00;"high caloric value, and taste better than a boiled potato."
51:00;51:01;"- Oh my God, can't you already see like"
51:01;51:05;"the kind of late period Disney movie of this"
51:05;51:08;"where Tom Hanks plays like Mr. Hershey"
51:08;51:11;"and John Hamm or something plays,"
51:11;51:13;"wait, what's the quartermaster's name?"
51:13;51:16;"- Quartermaster Colonel Paul Logan."
51:16;51:20;"- John Hamm is quartermaster Colonel Paul Logan."
51:20;51:25;"And he like gets off like the military plane in Hershey, PA."
51:25;51:27;"And he comes in and he's just like,"
51:27;51:29;"sir, do you love your country?"
51:29;51:30;"And Tom Hanks is like,"
51:30;51:31;"the only thing I love more than chocolate"
51:31;51:33;"is my country, sir."
51:33;51:35;"And he's like, we're in dire need of chocolate"
51:35;51:36;"that won't melt."
51:36;51:41;"It's kind of like a feel good PG Disney historical film."
51:41;51:43;"I mean, what am I even thinking of?"
51:43;51:44;"I'm like taking this from something,"
51:44;51:46;"but it seems like when America was at war."
51:46;51:49;"- Well, it's like every other Tom Hanks film."
51:49;51:51;"- Right."
51:51;51:52;"- You know, the story that's not told"
51:52;51:54;"is that the World War II bar"
51:54;51:58;"was sarcastically nicknamed Hitler's secret weapon"
51:58;52:02;"because the oat flour and the chocolate."
52:02;52:04;"- Movie title."
52:04;52:07;"- Made the bar so dense"
52:07;52:09;"that soldiers couldn't even bite into them."
52:09;52:11;"And the lack of sugar also rendered the chocolate"
52:11;52:13;"almost too bitter to be edible."
52:13;52:16;"And it caused constipation and made everybody feel awful."
52:16;52:20;"- Oh no, that's why Disney didn't make the movie"
52:20;52:23;"is because the Hershey company almost lost the war"
52:23;52:25;"for the Allies."
52:25;52:26;"- Yeah, that's not a movie."
52:26;52:28;"That's a good like eight part podcast."
52:28;52:30;"- Okay, it's either a podcast"
52:30;52:33;"or maybe it's like an HBO mini series,"
52:33;52:38;"like a Mildred Pierce, HBO period mini series."
52:38;52:40;"It all takes place in Hershey, PA."
52:40;52:42;"You know, and also Daniel, back me up,"
52:42;52:46;"a lot of German heritage in Pennsylvania, right?"
52:46;52:48;"- Yeah, I grew up in what some people would describe"
52:48;52:50;"as like Amish country, kind of."
52:50;52:51;"There's a lot of Pennsylvania Dutch people"
52:51;52:53;"and Amish people around."
52:53;52:56;"Definitely a huge German influence on like beer culture,"
52:56;52:57;"food culture and everything there."
52:57;53:00;"- Right, hence the beer and all the good food."
53:00;53:02;"So you could also imagine that there's like some weird"
53:02;53:06;"(beep) about like, there's a German immigrant guy"
53:06;53:09;"and he just got a job at the Hershey factory,"
53:09;53:11;"but he has like this heavy German accent."
53:11;53:12;"He actually is like a good dude."
53:12;53:13;"And he's just like,"
53:13;53:16;"""I want nothing more than to serve America."
53:16;53:17;"America, I love you."""
53:17;53:18;"But then like everybody else was like,"
53:18;53:20;"""I don't know if we can trust you, man."""
53:20;53:23;"And then there really is actually a Nazi spy,"
53:23;53:25;"but it's like some other dude"
53:25;53:27;"and you probably like learn some heartwarming lesson"
53:27;53:30;"about don't judge a book by its cover"
53:30;53:31;"or something like that."
53:31;53:34;"And that guy actually was putting the constipation"
53:34;53:36;"into the double agent chocolatier."
53:36;53:37;"I mean, there probably was (beep)"
53:37;53:40;"there was sabotage happening at American factories."
53:40;53:42;"Why wouldn't they have made it to Hershey beer?"
53:42;53:45;"- And then a title card at the end that just says,"
53:45;53:49;"""100 years later, a chocolate beer was developed"
53:49;53:51;"using the technology."""
53:51;53:53;"(laughing)"
53:53;53:56;"- The technology is still being used today."

54:20;54:22;"- Hershey's a crazy place,"
54:22;54:24;"but the town where the Yingling Brewery is,"
54:24;54:26;"which is called Pottsville, Pennsylvania,"
54:26;54:29;"is also a really crazy town."
54:29;54:30;"It's in the middle of nowhere."
54:30;54:33;"It's close to like Bloomsburg University,"
54:33;54:34;"which is where a lot of people at my high school"
54:34;54:35;"went to college."
54:35;54:38;"But in the '70s, Muhammad Ali trained there"
54:38;54:40;"at a place called Deer Lake,"
54:40;54:42;"right in the middle of a random town in Pennsylvania."
54:42;54:43;"- Wow. - Wow."
54:43;54:44;"- That sounds kind of familiar,"
54:44;54:47;"maybe in like a documentary I watched or something."
54:47;54:49;"- Right, the one where he fights George Foreman"
54:49;54:52;"in Zimbabwe or Zaire,"
54:52;54:53;"which country is it?"
54:53;54:54;"Rumble in the Jungle."
54:54;54:58;"And there's a bunch of Ali training in rural Pennsylvania."
54:58;54:59;"That's, yeah."
54:59;55:01;"- Pennsylvania is a fascinating state."
55:01;55:03;"- It's the kind of place where you can like"
55:03;55:05;"still buy a house for $12,000."
55:05;55:07;"It's really like the middle of nowhere."
55:07;55:11;"And the Yingling factory is the biggest employer in the town."
55:11;55:13;"Yingling is like the beer that everybody I knew"
55:13;55:14;"got drunk on for the first time."
55:14;55:16;"That's like the go-to Pennsylvania beer."
55:16;55:18;"- Right, I wanted to talk about that"
55:18;55:20;"because I grew up in New Jersey."
55:20;55:22;"New Jersey and Pennsylvania have a lot in common."
55:22;55:27;"And I think the first time I ever got (beep) faced,"
55:27;55:29;"it might've been on Yingling."
55:29;55:29;"Well, not (beep) faced,"
55:29;55:32;"maybe the first time I like drank a couple of beers."
55:32;55:33;"I think it was Yingling."
55:33;55:34;"And so I always thought of Yingling"
55:34;55:36;"as being like a major beer,"
55:36;55:38;"but I think, Jake, were you the one saying"
55:38;55:40;"they don't even sell it in California?"
55:40;55:41;"- I don't think they do."
55:41;55:42;"Daniel, can you verify?"
55:42;55:44;"- Yeah, they don't sell it in California."
55:44;55:46;"They sell it on the East Coast"
55:46;55:48;"and they're very provincial about it."
55:48;55:50;"They keep it local."
55:50;55:52;"I did see that they signed a deal"
55:52;55:54;"with I think a Coors distributor"
55:54;55:56;"that they're gonna start selling it in other places."
55:56;55:57;"But if you wanna get in California,"
55:57;55:59;"you have to have somebody send it to you."
55:59;56:01;"- But so you're in high school in Pennsylvania"
56:01;56:06;"and people are not buying Bud or Corona."
56:06;56:09;"Everyone's just feeling a sense of local pride"
56:09;56:11;"and it's just like, Yingling, dude."
56:11;56:13;"- Yeah, there's a little town near where I grew up"
56:13;56:17;"called, the town name is called Leather Corner Post."
56:17;56:17;"- Wow."
56:17;56:18;"- And there's a bar there"
56:18;56:20;"called the Leather Corner Post Hotel"
56:20;56:21;"that the last time I was there,"
56:21;56:22;"maybe like three or four years ago,"
56:22;56:24;"they still had Quarter Yinglings."
56:24;56:25;"- Wow."
56:25;56:26;"- So it's like a beer that's cheaper."
56:26;56:27;"- Quarter Yinglings?"
56:27;56:28;"- Yeah."
56:28;56:29;"- Wow."
56:29;56:30;"- All the time."
56:30;56:31;"So it's like, it's the cheapest beer"
56:31;56:32;"'cause they're getting it locally."
56:32;56:34;"And yeah, it's definitely the go-to"
56:34;56:36;"more than Bud or anything else,"
56:36;56:37;"at least in Allentown."
56:37;56:38;"- I love that."
56:38;56:40;"I love that there's some local pride"
56:40;56:43;"and they've avoided it all being swallowed"
56:43;56:45;"into some sort of global culture."
56:45;56:46;"They're sort of like the kids there"
56:46;56:50;"'cause kids are like averse to like local stuff that like."
56:50;56:51;"- Yeah."
56:51;56:52;"- You know, it's like interesting that they're like,"
56:52;56:53;"oh yeah, Yingling."
56:53;56:54;"- It's good."
56:54;56:57;"I'd say it's like 10% better than opening up a Budweiser."
56:57;56:58;"Like it's a little bit better."
56:58;57:01;"And then they make a black and tan that's really good too."
57:01;57:03;"So that's why I'm sort of hopeful"
57:03;57:05;"that maybe the chocolate beer will be delicious."
57:05;57:06;"- Crack it open."
57:06;57:08;"- Yeah, let's find out."
57:08;57:09;"- Is it cold?"
57:09;57:11;"- This is a porter."
57:11;57:15;"- It is a chocolate porter made in Pottsville, Pennsylvania."
57:15;57:18;"So this is a real Pennsylvania about to taste"
57:18;57:22;"300 years of Pennsylvania history live on the internet radio."
57:22;57:26;"He's drinking it folks."
57:26;57:27;"- Bottoms up."
57:27;57:29;"- Oh, that's very rough."
57:29;57:32;"After all this buildup."
57:32;57:36;"- No, it actually doesn't have that bad."
57:36;57:38;"It has a pretty good aftertaste,"
57:38;57:40;"but it tastes like you took a sip of a Budweiser"
57:40;57:43;"and then ate a Tootsie Roll immediately afterwards."
57:44;57:46;"- Is it like really sweet then?"
57:46;57:47;"- It's not sweet."
57:47;57:50;"It just has sort of like a treacly chocolatey"
57:50;57:52;"kind of flavor hanging around."
57:52;57:53;"- Right."
57:53;57:54;"- But I gotta say, Tootsie Roll."
57:54;57:55;"- Going back in for taste number two."
57:55;57:56;"- Go back in."
57:56;57:58;"I feel like Tootsie Roll is the worst form"
57:58;58:01;"of chocolate imaginable."
58:01;58:02;"- I disagree."
58:02;58:03;"- Really?"
58:03;58:04;"- I disagree."
58:04;58:06;"Also, you know what's funny?"
58:06;58:09;"I was about to say like, does Hershey's make Tootsie Roll?"
58:09;58:10;"I looked it up."
58:10;58:13;"No, Tootsie Roll is not a Hershey's product."
58:13;58:16;"It's manufactured by Tootsie Roll Industries"
58:16;58:18;"based in Chicago, Illinois."
58:18;58:21;"- How great a name is Tootsie Roll Industries?"
58:21;58:23;"- T-R-I."
58:23;58:26;"- Daniel, is it getting any better with subsequent tastes?"
58:26;58:28;"- No."
58:28;58:29;"It's definitely not something I would drink"
58:29;58:30;"more than one of."
58:30;58:34;"I hate to report that it's not my favorite beer of all time,"
58:34;58:36;"but it's definitely not."
58:36;58:38;"I'm washing it down with a Peroni right now."
58:38;58:39;"- Damn, bad luck for PA."
58:41;58:43;"Now, given that our election"
58:43;58:45;"and potentially the future of this country"
58:45;58:47;"might come down to Pennsylvania,"
58:47;58:50;"we need to try to turn this into like a bright spot."
58:50;58:52;"- Well, I'm happy to hear that it's made it"
58:52;58:55;"onto the shelves of every Wegmans in Allentown already."
58:55;58:57;"It seems like they're pushing it pretty hard"
58:57;58:58;"in my local area."
58:58;59:00;"I wouldn't say this is exactly a winner,"
59:00;59:03;"but maybe there'll be like a Reese's Yingling down the road"
59:03;59:06;"that's like, that's a 2.0 of this,"
59:06;59:07;"but this is definitely not it."
59:07;59:09;"- Maybe the fact that Pennsylvania"
59:09;59:14;"is taking such a massive L with the Hershey's Yingling,"
59:14;59:17;"then we gotta hope that in November,"
59:17;59:20;"PA will really come through for the country."
59:20;59:22;"We've discussed on the show,"
59:22;59:23;"Jake is borderline ashamed"
59:23;59:27;"of how Connecticut punches below its weight,"
59:27;59:31;"but I would say that, you know, New Jersey is off derided,"
59:31;59:33;"but at least New Jersey has like"
59:33;59:34;"these famous cultural products"
59:34;59:36;"and it's like, you know, it's out there."
59:36;59:37;"I would say that Pennsylvania,"
59:37;59:40;"especially once you get outside of like Philly,"
59:40;59:43;"everybody knows Philly cheese steaks and the sports teams,"
59:43;59:45;"but I do think Pennsylvania is a very interesting state"
59:45;59:48;"that like people don't really like get,"
59:48;59:49;"you know what I mean?"
59:49;59:50;"- I do for sure."
59:50;59:52;"I actually thought what you said was right on."
59:52;59:54;"I kind of associated the area I grew up with"
59:54;59:57;"as being almost Jersey too."
59:57;01:00:00;"I grew up 20 minutes from Phillipsburg, New Jersey."
01:00:00;01:00:03;"I went to punk shows in New Jersey basements"
01:00:03;01:00:04;"and backyards and stuff like that,"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"almost as much as I did Pennsylvania."
01:00:06;01:00:09;"So there was always that kind of cross-pollination for me."
01:00:09;01:00:12;"And yeah, I mean, I want to be clear."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"I love both Yingling and Hershey's,"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"but it's funny to me that beer and chocolate"
01:00:15;01:00:18;"are like the two iconic things for Pennsylvania."
01:00:18;01:00:21;"It is like rooted in like strange German culture."
01:00:21;01:00:24;"There's a lot of very like conservative people around."
01:00:24;01:00:26;"There's a famous phrase about Pennsylvania"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"that it's Philadelphia and Pittsburgh"
01:00:28;01:00:29;"with Alabama in between,"
01:00:29;01:00:32;"because the center of Pennsylvania"
01:00:32;01:00:33;"has a lot of like hate groups"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"and things that are really, really rough"
01:00:35;01:00:38;"and don't reflect well on the state."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"So it is like a little bit of an identity-less state,"
01:00:40;01:00:41;"I think sometimes."
01:00:41;01:00:42;"- Maybe because it's so big."
01:00:42;01:00:45;"I mean, I'm sure this has come up on the show before,"
01:00:45;01:00:47;"and I imagine you can relate to this."
01:00:47;01:00:48;"And definitely Jake,"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"we may have even done one of these drives together"
01:00:50;01:00:53;"when we toured together in the Dirty Projectors days."
01:00:53;01:00:57;"When you drive from like say New York City to Chicago,"
01:00:57;01:01:01;"there's something so buff about how wide Pennsylvania is."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"In your head, you're just like,"
01:01:02;01:01:06;"all right, gonna rip through Jersey, Pennsylvania,"
01:01:06;01:01:09;"Ohio, Indiana, and then Chicago."
01:01:09;01:01:10;"And then there's just something about"
01:01:10;01:01:11;"when you hit Pennsylvania,"
01:01:11;01:01:14;"you realize that's like a solid six hour drive."
01:01:14;01:01:17;"All the other states are like reasonably wide."
01:01:17;01:01:20;"Pennsylvania is just so girthy,"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"just a big fat state."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"- And that's our identity, the girthy state."
01:01:24;01:01:25;"- The girthy state."
01:01:25;01:01:29;"- I think you need to add a Hershey Park trip"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"into the middle of Pennsylvania from now on."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"Maybe that's the thing. - You can break it up."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"- Yeah, just 'cause driving through Pennsylvania,"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"it just feels endless."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"Whether or not it's true that it's Alabama in the center,"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"it's a lot of country in the center."
01:01:41;01:01:43;"Isn't Pennsylvania where there's that like old"
01:01:43;01:01:46;"like coal mining town that's on fire?"
01:01:46;01:01:47;"- Yes, Centralia."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"- Did you ever go there?"
01:01:48;01:01:51;"That's like a classic like high school kid thing to do."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"- I did, yeah, when I was like 21,"
01:01:53;01:01:54;"the girl I was dating at the time"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"made a documentary about it."
01:01:56;01:01:59;"And I went up there and yeah, it's a 50,"
01:01:59;01:02:01;"you know, it's a town that's been on fire for 50 years."
01:02:01;01:02:04;"There's an underground coal mine burning underground"
01:02:04;01:02:06;"that they know they'll never be able to put out"
01:02:06;01:02:07;"until it burns out."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"- It's a ghost town essentially."
01:02:09;01:02:12;"- Yeah, when I was there, there were about three houses left"
01:02:12;01:02:14;"and one of them had a chimney built up"
01:02:14;01:02:15;"through the middle of it,"
01:02:15;01:02:18;"just expounding steam out from the ground."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"- Oh my God."
01:02:19;01:02:21;"And you can just drive up there?"
01:02:21;01:02:22;"- Yeah."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"- Oh, there's a guy still living there."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"- The highways are all cracked from the pressure"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"and you can basically like drive on a highway"
01:02:27;01:02:30;"that just ends when it got so damaged,"
01:02:30;01:02:31;"they couldn't use it anymore."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"And they paid everybody to leave town."
01:02:33;01:02:35;"Another Pennsylvania town where you could probably"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"buy property for $10,000 or something."
01:02:37;01:02:41;"It's like, yeah, it is like, it's basically a ghost town."
01:02:41;01:02:43;"- That might be nice in the winter,"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"in a tough Pennsylvania winter, you go there,"
01:02:45;01:02:48;"it's probably kind of tropical, semi-tropical."
01:02:48;01:02:51;"- I hope we're not reaching the sleep in caves"
01:02:51;01:02:54;"portion of our society, but yeah, it might be a good spot."
01:02:54;01:02:57;"- So it's a thumbs down on the Hershey's Yangling,"
01:02:57;01:02:58;"but that's just one man's opinion."
01:02:58;01:03:01;"Daniel, Jake and I will still go in"
01:03:01;01:03:04;"with totally open minds when we try it,"
01:03:04;01:03:05;"perhaps on the next show."
01:03:05;01:03:06;"- Two weeks from now."
01:03:06;01:03:09;"- Should we break it up that maybe Jake,"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"you try it on the next one,"
01:03:11;01:03:12;"and then the one after that, I try it,"
01:03:12;01:03:15;"then Nick and sign, but we keep this going for months."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"- Let's practice out."
01:03:17;01:03:20;"- Yeah, that seems great."
01:03:20;01:03:23;"- We should invite Tim Heidecker back on the show"
01:03:23;01:03:24;"to try it on the next episode."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"- Allentown man."
01:03:25;01:03:26;"- Another Allentown guy."
01:03:26;01:03:28;"- We actually went to rival high schools."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"- Oh really?"
01:03:29;01:03:30;"- Yeah."
01:03:30;01:03:33;"- What's your take on the Billy Joel song, ""Allentown""?"
01:03:33;01:03:34;"- Well, I think, I know Jake knows,"
01:03:34;01:03:36;"and I don't know if the rest of you guys know,"
01:03:36;01:03:37;"but for the past couple of years,"
01:03:37;01:03:39;"I've been working as a bartender out in Malibu,"
01:03:39;01:03:43;"and people like to ask bartenders where they're from,"
01:03:43;01:03:46;"and when I say Allentown, I have had a conversation"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"about Billy Joel probably five days a week"
01:03:48;01:03:51;"for like two years, because it's the only thing"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"people know about Allentown."
01:03:53;01:03:55;"- Does anybody ever not reference the Billy Joel song,"
01:03:55;01:03:56;"but you know that's the only thing they know?"
01:03:56;01:03:59;"They're just like, ""Oh man, how's it been"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"since they shut all the factories down?"""
01:04:01;01:04:02;"(laughing)"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"Are your folks still living out in Allentown?"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"- Yeah, out on the Jersey Shore."
01:04:06;01:04:07;"(laughing)"
01:04:07;01:04:08;"- Well, working out in Malibu,"
01:04:08;01:04:10;"I bet you get some interesting customers,"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"and probably occasionally some showbiz types."
01:04:12;01:04:14;"So have you ever had somebody sit down and say like,"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"""Oh, I'm Billy's lawyer."
01:04:16;01:04:19;"Let's FaceTime him right now."""
01:04:19;01:04:20;"- No, I've never had that happen."
01:04:20;01:04:22;"The closest, I don't work there anymore,"
01:04:22;01:04:24;"so I can kind of talk about this stuff now, but."
01:04:24;01:04:25;"- Oh, nice."
01:04:25;01:04:27;"- One night, Rod Stewart came in with his wife,"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"and he actually sort of became a regular."
01:04:29;01:04:30;"I got to know him a little bit."
01:04:30;01:04:31;"- Legend."
01:04:31;01:04:33;"- He once sang my name when he came into the bar,"
01:04:33;01:04:34;"which was pretty cool."
01:04:34;01:04:35;"- Oh, sick."
01:04:35;01:04:39;"- And his wife was with him, and she's a really sweet lady."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"I really enjoyed spending time with her."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"And she, I was going to see the Rolling Stones"
01:04:43;01:04:46;"the next night, and I had made a drink special"
01:04:46;01:04:49;"called the Tumbling Dice, and she took a picture"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"of the sign that I had made for it, and she was like,"
01:04:51;01:04:53;"""We're going up to Ronnie's for dinner tonight."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"I'm going to send him this so I can show him"
01:04:55;01:04:56;"the drink you made for the Rolling Stones."""
01:04:56;01:04:57;"- Oh my God."
01:04:57;01:04:58;"- That's pretty crazy."
01:04:58;01:04:59;"- That's awesome."
01:04:59;01:05:01;"- One of the things I liked about working there"
01:05:01;01:05:03;"is a lot of people who came wanted to talk about"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"like the musical history of Malibu."
01:05:05;01:05:08;"They loved Neil Young, or they loved Bob Dylan."
01:05:08;01:05:10;"You know, Dylans lived there for the past,"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"like, I don't know, 25, 30 years."
01:05:12;01:05:15;"Yeah, it actually kind of took becoming a bartender"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"to figure out how to be like a better music writer,"
01:05:17;01:05:20;"because I actually found out what people really care about"
01:05:20;01:05:23;"with music, like people really are into the history"
01:05:23;01:05:25;"and the lore, and Malibu is like,"
01:05:25;01:05:27;"has a really fascinating history in general."
01:05:27;01:05:30;"- Would you get people who like came from other parts"
01:05:30;01:05:34;"of the US or the world just to come check out Malibu?"
01:05:34;01:05:35;"- Definitely."
01:05:35;01:05:38;"There's like a top five country song right now"
01:05:38;01:05:39;"that mentions Malibu."
01:05:39;01:05:42;"There's like six rap songs that mention Malibu"
01:05:42;01:05:43;"that are popular right now."
01:05:43;01:05:45;"It's like become such a cultural thing that like,"
01:05:45;01:05:48;"people do go there to stand in front of Nobu."
01:05:48;01:05:51;"They go there to experience a little bit of like"
01:05:51;01:05:55;"the current music culture, and then also the old timers"
01:05:55;01:05:55;"who would come in would be like,"
01:05:55;01:05:58;"oh, that place across the street, Cafe Escobar,"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"Neil Young used to own that place back in the '70s."
01:06:00;01:06:02;"That was the crazy horse."
01:06:02;01:06:04;"So it does have like a cool history."
01:06:04;01:06:06;"- Well, and you're working on a story"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"about Philip Kramer, right?"
01:06:08;01:06:09;"- Yeah."
01:06:09;01:06:11;"I just found a couple of really amazing producers"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"to work on this project with."
01:06:13;01:06:16;"I'm doing a story about this guy, Philip Taylor Kramer"
01:06:16;01:06:19;"from the band Iron Butterfly,"
01:06:19;01:06:22;"and he disappeared in Malibu in 1995."
01:06:22;01:06:23;"- Ah."
01:06:23;01:06:27;"- He was also a rocket scientist and a electrical engineer."
01:06:27;01:06:29;"And a couple of weeks before he disappeared,"
01:06:29;01:06:32;"he claimed that he invented teleportation."
01:06:32;01:06:33;"So it's a crazy story,"
01:06:33;01:06:36;"and I've been talking to all kinds of scientists"
01:06:36;01:06:40;"and his family, and yeah, I'm pretty excited about it."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"We're gonna have it out pretty soon."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"- Oh, sick."
01:06:42;01:06:43;"That's amazing."
01:06:43;01:06:45;"- Yeah, it's a wild one for sure."
01:06:45;01:06:48;"- One random question, and I imagine at a high end bar"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"in Malibu, this might not have come up too often,"
01:06:50;01:06:54;"but are you familiar with Jolly Rancher-based"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"alcoholic drinks?"
01:06:56;01:06:59;"It's a thing, I believe, maybe not at a nice bar,"
01:06:59;01:07:02;"but is it like a high school kid thing"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"or vodka with Jolly Ranchers?"
01:07:04;01:07:07;"Did you know anything about this?"
01:07:07;01:07:09;"- The only thing I know that's called a Jolly Rancher"
01:07:09;01:07:13;"is it's often, I also worked at like kind of a more divy bar"
01:07:13;01:07:14;"in San Pedro for a while,"
01:07:14;01:07:17;"and like if people were ordering like a bunch of shots,"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"they would order a Jolly Rancher,"
01:07:19;01:07:23;"which would be like vodka, lime, simple syrup,"
01:07:23;01:07:26;"and some sort of red curacao or something like that,"
01:07:26;01:07:27;"and then you'd shake it up super cold"
01:07:27;01:07:29;"and take it as a shot,"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"but I don't know specifically like a Jolly Rancher cocktail."
01:07:31;01:07:32;"- In the course of bartending,"
01:07:32;01:07:36;"you've never had to melt down a pot of Jolly Ranchers?"
01:07:36;01:07:37;"- No, but the bar I worked in,"
01:07:37;01:07:40;"I had drinks that had like 16 ingredients in them,"
01:07:40;01:07:43;"and I would have to melt sugar into glass sculptures"
01:07:43;01:07:46;"to put across the top of glasses and stuff like that."
01:07:46;01:07:47;"- Oh my God."
01:07:47;01:07:48;"- So I'm used to a little bit of that kind of stuff,"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"but the Jolly Rancher does not,"
01:07:50;01:07:52;"I don't know if there's a lot of Jolly Rancher"
01:07:52;01:07:53;"metal do crossover."
01:07:53;01:07:56;"- You basically know how to make everything now?"
01:07:56;01:07:57;"- I do, yeah."
01:07:57;01:08:01;"And I'm a level one certified sommelier too from that job,"
01:08:01;01:08:02;"which is kind of cool."
01:08:02;01:08:04;"- Well, and we were all talking off mic,"
01:08:04;01:08:06;"we were talking with Daniel"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"about pursuing the Sweet Chili Heat idea."
01:08:08;01:08:10;"- Yeah, dudes, I've got bottles sitting here."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"Anytime you want to take it."
01:08:11;01:08:13;"- All right, we got it."
01:08:13;01:08:15;"- We were cooking that idea up and then COVID hit,"
01:08:15;01:08:19;"but we have a top tier bartender here."
01:08:19;01:08:20;"- I do actually miss bartending a lot."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"I hope that I get to do it again someday."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"There's no bars open here now, unfortunately."
01:08:24;01:08:27;"- Right, I mean, the social aspect of it,"
01:08:27;01:08:30;"it's like, obviously it's very meaningful"
01:08:30;01:08:33;"to a lot of people to just have a place to go."
01:08:33;01:08:36;"- Yeah, I always had Mondays and Tuesdays off"
01:08:36;01:08:37;"'cause of my work schedule."
01:08:37;01:08:39;"And I was always, I went to a karaoke thing"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"every Monday night for like two years"
01:08:41;01:08:42;"with one of my buddies."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"So yeah, it's like, that's all gone."
01:08:44;01:08:47;"We've tried to do a Zoom karaoke thing"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"and it's been depressing, so."
01:08:49;01:08:50;"- God."
01:08:50;01:08:52;"- This is about the kind of social interactions"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"I have for the most part is this kind of stuff."
01:08:54;01:08:55;"I don't head out that much."
01:08:55;01:08:58;"- Well, hopefully soon we'll be bringing back the bars."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"- One quick question."
01:08:59;01:09:02;"When Rod Stewart would sing your name,"
01:09:02;01:09:03;"would he sing it in the,"
01:09:03;01:09:06;"would he sing the Elton John song?"
01:09:06;01:09:07;"- That's exactly what happened."
01:09:07;01:09:09;"He walked in one day and went,"
01:09:09;01:09:12;"♪ Daniel, my brother, you are older than me ♪"
01:09:12;01:09:16;"And then I remember the same day when he left,"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"he answered the lobby phone."
01:09:18;01:09:19;"He just picked it up and went,"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"""Malibu and Rod Stewart speaking,"""
01:09:21;01:09:22;"and then hung up the phone."
01:09:22;01:09:23;"(laughing)"
01:09:23;01:09:26;"- God, that rules."
01:09:26;01:09:27;"- Yeah."
01:09:27;01:09:28;"- That was Rod Stewart."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"- Yeah, and actually I was gonna tell you guys,"
01:09:29;01:09:31;"one of the other cool ones was"
01:09:31;01:09:33;"I got to talk to Lior Cohen."
01:09:33;01:09:35;"He came into the, he's like a musical,"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"he came into the bar one night at like nine o'clock"
01:09:37;01:09:41;"and he was the only person there for the last three hours."
01:09:41;01:09:42;"And we just shot the (beep)"
01:09:42;01:09:45;"and he was telling me about working with Willie Nelson"
01:09:45;01:09:46;"and all this crazy stuff."
01:09:46;01:09:48;"It was like, those were the nights where I was,"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"I felt so lucky to have that job."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"- Yeah, that seems like best case scenario"
01:09:51;01:09:54;"is just like you and one person"
01:09:54;01:09:59;"make a drink every like 30 minutes, just talk."
01:09:59;01:10:00;"- Yeah."
01:10:00;01:10:01;"- Are there a lot of nights like that?"
01:10:01;01:10:03;"- Yeah, out there, there were."
01:10:03;01:10:05;"- Well, hopefully we'll all be having a drink"
01:10:05;01:10:07;"in the not so distant future,"
01:10:07;01:10:09;"pounding some sweet chili heat."
01:10:09;01:10:10;"- Oh yeah."
01:10:10;01:10:12;"- Not a Hershey."
01:10:12;01:10:14;"(laughing)"
01:10:14;01:10:17;"- Yeah, or a Dodger Stadium margarita."
01:10:17;01:10:18;"- Right."
01:10:18;01:10:21;"- You just had the worst yingling of your life."
01:10:21;01:10:23;"- I did just have the worst yingling of my life."
01:10:23;01:10:27;"- Like verse one is like, let's be clear."
01:10:27;01:10:29;"I'm a Pennsylvania through and through."
01:10:29;01:10:31;"I love my home state."
01:10:31;01:10:32;"- And I love my home bro."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"- Yeah, and I love my home bro, but."
01:10:34;01:10:35;"- Yeah."
01:10:35;01:10:40;"- Well, thanks so much, dude."
01:10:40;01:10:42;"- Guys, thank you so much."
01:10:42;01:10:43;"Yeah, you know I'm a big TC fan,"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"so thanks for having me on."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"- Oh, we'll definitely be having you back."
01:10:47;01:10:48;"Broke the seal now."
01:10:48;01:10:49;"All right, have a good one, dude."
01:10:49;01:10:51;"- Talk to you guys later."
01:10:51;01:10:52;"- Bye."
01:10:52;01:10:52;"- Peace."
01:10:52;01:10:53;"- Bye."

01:11:53;01:11:56;"- Thank you, Daniel."
01:11:56;01:11:58;"And to the Hershey's Company, don't worry, Jake,"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"and I still will try our Hershey's Younglings"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"with open minds."
01:12:02;01:12:03;"But we cannot be bought."
01:12:03;01:12:05;"Just like Daniel, we will be honest"
01:12:05;01:12:07;"about what we think about it."
01:12:07;01:12:08;"So stay tuned."
01:12:08;01:12:11;"That'll be in the next seven episodes."
01:12:11;01:12:15;"We'll be the unfolding saga of the Hershey's England Porter."
01:12:15;01:12:18;"All right, Seinfeld, we got a little social media report"
01:12:18;01:12:19;"coming from you."
01:12:19;01:12:23;"- Yeah, we received an email to our fan email address,"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"which is 8minutecapecod@gmail.com."
01:12:25;01:12:28;"That's the numeral, not the word eight."
01:12:28;01:12:31;"8minutecapecod@gmail.com."
01:12:31;01:12:34;"From fan of the show, Camelia Munoz."
01:12:34;01:12:38;"- Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
01:12:38;01:12:41;"- Hey, TC, I don't know if you've all"
01:12:41;01:12:42;"been made aware of it yet,"
01:12:42;01:12:47;"but ""Campus"" by Vampire Weekend has become a TikTok song"
01:12:47;01:12:50;"within a trend/challenge on the app."
01:12:50;01:12:51;"Basically, people play the song"
01:12:51;01:12:55;"while showing clips of their college campuses as follows."
01:12:55;01:12:58;"And then she's sent a link to an example"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"of what she's talking about."
01:13:00;01:13:05;"Also, this particular one, where the girl taking the video"
01:13:05;01:13:06;"actually goes to Columbia."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"- And even before we got this email, Seinfeld,"
01:13:08;01:13:11;"you were maybe sharing some tweets or something."
01:13:11;01:13:12;"- It's one of those things"
01:13:12;01:13:15;"that I've received several DMs about."
01:13:15;01:13:18;"- And first question is, is there a Seinfeld 2000 TikTok?"
01:13:18;01:13:19;"Do you have an account?"
01:13:19;01:13:22;"- There is, I think I have one thing on it."
01:13:22;01:13:23;"Just 'cause when TikTok, and we're talking about"
01:13:23;01:13:27;"the start of this year, when it started to become a thing,"
01:13:27;01:13:30;"typically what I'll do is I'll just make sure"
01:13:30;01:13:33;"that I have Seinfeld 2000 on any platform"
01:13:33;01:13:37;"so someone else doesn't try to be an imposter."
01:13:37;01:13:41;"And I did post one thing, didn't really do that hot."
01:13:41;01:13:43;"Maybe I was too ahead of the game"
01:13:43;01:13:44;"and I was kind of turned off forever."
01:13:44;01:13:48;"I was like, this is not going immediately viral."
01:13:48;01:13:49;"And really, I don't have the energy"
01:13:49;01:13:52;"to maintain yet another account on another platform."
01:13:52;01:13:54;"So I just kind of let it sit."
01:13:54;01:13:54;"- Well, hold on a second."
01:13:54;01:13:56;"Sounds like you've been a little bit spoiled"
01:13:56;01:13:57;"by Twitter and Instagram."
01:13:57;01:14:00;"I mean, I remember when I first started"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"following you on Twitter, man, you'd be lucky"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"if you had 5,000 followers."
01:14:04;01:14:07;"You know, like you got to put in the work, Seinfeld."
01:14:07;01:14:09;"- It's a lot of maintenance."
01:14:09;01:14:10;"It's a lot of upkeep."
01:14:10;01:14:13;"You know, I stopped posting on Facebook for that reason."
01:14:13;01:14:15;"'Cause it's just like, you know, it's okay."
01:14:15;01:14:16;"It's okay, guys."
01:14:16;01:14:19;"Just like, anyway, why are we talking about this?"
01:14:19;01:14:20;"Right, so I am on TikTok."
01:14:20;01:14:22;"- Have you watched some of these?"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"- Yeah, I've watched a few of them."
01:14:24;01:14:28;"- Generally speaking, is there like a joke or a dance"
01:14:28;01:14:31;"or people just like show around their campus?"
01:14:31;01:14:35;"- I would say there isn't really an explicit joke to it."
01:14:35;01:14:37;"I would say there's a structure to it"
01:14:37;01:14:41;"that I guess once replicated, starts to feel like a joke,"
01:14:41;01:14:44;"as these memes, you know, typically are."
01:14:44;01:14:48;"But it seems like once the refrain of the song starts,"
01:14:48;01:14:51;"people start to show their campus."
01:14:51;01:14:54;"And in the best ones, there's something a little,"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"you know, a little unique to that."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"- Weird happening?"
01:14:57;01:14:58;"- Weird happening."
01:14:58;01:15:00;"Yeah, I see one where there's a bear"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"roaming around on campus."
01:15:02;01:15:03;"- Uh-oh."
01:15:03;01:15:05;"- I think that's kind of all there is to it, really."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"- Well, it seems harmless."
01:15:07;01:15:08;"I mean, I made a joke on the thread"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"when you said this was going viral,"
01:15:09;01:15:13;"and I said, ""12 years of corrective PR down the drain."""
01:15:13;01:15:16;"Just because, obviously."
01:15:16;01:15:18;"I think it's a great song, and I love anything"
01:15:18;01:15:21;"that gets people back into the early stuff."
01:15:21;01:15:23;"The only thing though is that,"
01:15:23;01:15:25;"and I think within the song ""Campus,"""
01:15:25;01:15:26;"there's some complexity,"
01:15:26;01:15:29;"because that originally started with a demo Rostam made,"
01:15:29;01:15:31;"and that's the, I think that might be"
01:15:31;01:15:32;"the only Vampire Weekend song"
01:15:32;01:15:36;"that lyrically didn't start with my words or ideas."
01:15:36;01:15:38;"So I added a few things here and there to the song,"
01:15:38;01:15:42;"and I think we came together to give it something."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"And the parts that I added, as I recall,"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"were like, I added the cruel professor part,"
01:15:46;01:15:47;"'cause I just wanted to make sure"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"that it had a little bit of,"
01:15:49;01:15:52;"I don't know what to say, not darkness,"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"but just a little bit of uneasiness."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"And I wrote the line about the person"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"who spilled kefir on their keffiyeh,"
01:15:58;01:15:59;"because that was an era,"
01:15:59;01:16:01;"which definitely would not happen in 2020,"
01:16:01;01:16:04;"but where a lot of non-Palestinian,"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"left-leaning activist types"
01:16:06;01:16:09;"would wear the traditional Palestinian scarf."
01:16:09;01:16:11;"I think sometimes it shows solidarity"
01:16:11;01:16:13;"with the Palestinian struggle,"
01:16:13;01:16:14;"but it also very quickly became"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"just this kind of fashion-y thing,"
01:16:16;01:16:20;"and kind of made me think of some of the empty posturing"
01:16:20;01:16:23;"that you occasionally encounter on a college campus."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"So it was always important to me,"
01:16:25;01:16:27;"and I think to everybody in the band,"
01:16:27;01:16:30;"that because ""Vampire Weekend"" in the early days"
01:16:30;01:16:32;"came across so strongly"
01:16:32;01:16:36;"with our semi-satirical Ivy League preppy thing,"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"it was important that within the songs,"
01:16:38;01:16:39;"especially a song called ""Campus,"""
01:16:39;01:16:41;"that there were a few elements,"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"and I think the way everybody plays on it,"
01:16:43;01:16:45;"giving it this kind of more jagged punk feel"
01:16:45;01:16:47;"than the way Rossin originally had it"
01:16:47;01:16:48;"mocked up with strings,"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"I think all that stuff kind of combined it"
01:16:50;01:16:53;"to fit a tone, you know,"
01:16:53;01:16:56;"similar to like the Oxford commas in these songs"
01:16:56;01:17:00;"that are a little bit about grappling with elitism."
01:17:00;01:17:02;"So anyway, that's all to say that,"
01:17:02;01:17:03;"because in the early days,"
01:17:03;01:17:07;"people came so hard for us as being like,"
01:17:07;01:17:11;"are you guys just some like stuck-up rich kids,"
01:17:11;01:17:13;"and your music is literally just about showing off"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"that you went to an Ivy League school?"
01:17:15;01:17:17;"I gotta say, when you first told me about the challenge,"
01:17:17;01:17:20;"you know, it triggered some old trauma"
01:17:20;01:17:20;"where I'm just like,"
01:17:20;01:17:23;"""Ugh, is this literally just people"
01:17:23;01:17:24;"""showing off their campuses?"""
01:17:24;01:17:28;"And look, I'm sure there's all sorts of different schools,"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"but I would just hope that within the trend,"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"there is a little bit of a,"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"if it's truly in the Vampire Weekend spirit,"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"you know, I hope there's a little bit of satire,"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"but at the same time,"
01:17:38;01:17:40;"once you make music and you release a song,"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"it's in the hands of the world now."
01:17:42;01:17:43;"- Ezra, how did it strike you that,"
01:17:43;01:17:48;"you know, I feel like there's so many record labels,"
01:17:48;01:17:50;"music marketing people, artists,"
01:17:50;01:17:53;"trying to force their way into the mainstream"
01:17:53;01:17:56;"through the TikTok platform"
01:17:56;01:17:59;"as a means of generating the next Old Town Road"
01:17:59;01:18:00;"or what have you,"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"and you've just sort of like organically"
01:18:02;01:18:06;"had some old material just sort of naturally become"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"part of the fabric of this platform."
01:18:08;01:18:10;"- I think when we first talked about TikTok on the show,"
01:18:10;01:18:13;"I got a DM or two where somebody said"
01:18:13;01:18:16;"that Apunk once had a little moment on TikTok,"
01:18:16;01:18:19;"maybe, but it was kind of before TikTok was quite so huge,"
01:18:19;01:18:22;"so it couldn't have made the same impact as Campus."
01:18:22;01:18:24;"But so like, you know, I'd heard about it,"
01:18:24;01:18:27;"but look, outside of my own personal fears"
01:18:27;01:18:29;"about people misinterpreting our first album,"
01:18:29;01:18:31;"which I'll probably have for the rest of my life,"
01:18:31;01:18:35;"I will say that any time anything bubbles up"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"with old music, I love it,"
01:18:37;01:18:38;"because it's like,"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"there's only so much you can do in the moment"
01:18:40;01:18:43;"to like promote your new music, right?"
01:18:43;01:18:45;"Like, you know, we put out an album last year,"
01:18:45;01:18:46;"and of course we went on tour,"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"made, you know, all the things that you do."
01:18:48;01:18:52;"But after that, your catalog, you know,"
01:18:52;01:18:53;"kind of just sits there,"
01:18:53;01:18:55;"and every once in a while you get a call like,"
01:18:55;01:18:58;"oh, they want to use a song from Contra in a commercial,"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"and you're like, oh, interesting."
01:19:00;01:19:04;"Or suddenly you'll get a nice note from somebody"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"who's just listened to like Modern Vampires"
01:19:06;01:19:07;"for the first time or something."
01:19:07;01:19:10;"But anyway, because as a musician,"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"you've got to be so focused on like the present"
01:19:12;01:19:12;"and what comes next,"
01:19:12;01:19:15;"it's always nice to get these little reminders"
01:19:15;01:19:18;"that everything your band has ever done"
01:19:18;01:19:21;"is still reaching new people."
01:19:21;01:19:24;"So in that sense, I love hearing stories like this."
01:19:24;01:19:25;"- Hey, I'm so sorry."
01:19:25;01:19:27;"I had to step out for one second."
01:19:27;01:19:29;"So you might've mentioned this."
01:19:29;01:19:33;"In the article I'm reading, @goblin_influencer,"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"in her campus video,"
01:19:35;01:19:38;"her caption says, ""Love your school,"
01:19:38;01:19:39;"and it should be a place where you're happy,"
01:19:39;01:19:41;"but keep this in mind,"
01:19:41;01:19:42;"because some of these vids are missing the point."
01:19:42;01:19:44;"#VampireWeekend."""
01:19:44;01:19:45;"- Ooh."
01:19:45;01:19:48;"- And in her TikTok,"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"the text at the top says,"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"""This is a reminder that all of Vampire Weekend's music"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"is about feeling alienated from the elitist class"
01:19:54;01:19:57;"society culture while still wanting to be validated by it."
01:19:57;01:20:00;"Ezra Koenig has mentioned that all of the members"
01:20:00;01:20:01;"went to Columbia on scholarships"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"and didn't fit with the traditional WASP mold."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"Campus was literally written"
01:20:05;01:20:08;"by an Iranian-American gay guy about his experiences."""
01:20:08;01:20:09;"So whether or not all that's true,"
01:20:09;01:20:13;"there are people who are reclaiming your feelings"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"of this is not just to celebrate one thing."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"So outside of the-"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"- Yeah, she didn't get all her facts straight."
01:20:18;01:20:19;"(laughs)"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"Not everybody went to Columbia,"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"but I like the spirit of it."
01:20:23;01:20:24;"Well, one thing I've always said is,"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"I might've been the only member of the band"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"who had any scholarship or student loans thing,"
01:20:28;01:20:31;"but everybody did come from different backgrounds"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"and I think didn't exactly,"
01:20:33;01:20:34;"I think the other part of it is true,"
01:20:34;01:20:37;"that not everybody fit the kind of WASP mold."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"And I think it's important to recognize"
01:20:39;01:20:42;"the extent to which many, many people do feel,"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"I would imagine a school like Columbia,"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"if you really said, ""What percentage of people here"
01:20:46;01:20:49;"feel like they 100% fit into the history"
01:20:49;01:20:51;"of these old Ivy League schools?"""
01:20:51;01:20:52;"It's a very low percentage."
01:20:52;01:20:55;"Most people feel alienated in some way."
01:20:55;01:21:00;"And I think that's why an album that on its face,"
01:21:00;01:21:02;"like our first album,"
01:21:02;01:21:07;"seemed so, was so easy to deride because,"
01:21:07;01:21:09;"and of course, obviously things went well."
01:21:09;01:21:10;"People were into it when it came out,"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"but for a lot of people, they had questions."
01:21:12;01:21:14;"They were like, ""Is this just some rich kid (beep)?"""
01:21:14;01:21:15;"As I was saying before,"
01:21:15;01:21:19;"I'd like to think that the alienation part of it"
01:21:19;01:21:22;"and the questioning and the wondering how you fit in"
01:21:22;01:21:24;"and all those things,"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"I would like to think that part of the reason"
01:21:26;01:21:28;"that album has an enduring appeal to this day"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"is because most people,"
01:21:30;01:21:32;"whether they went to an Ivy League school,"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"even if they didn't go to college period,"
01:21:34;01:21:36;"those feelings are something"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"that almost every human being experiences,"
01:21:38;01:21:41;"those feelings of questioning, belonging, alienation."
01:21:41;01:21:44;"And I'd like to think that that's why our audience"
01:21:44;01:21:49;"is not just like New York rich kids or Ivy League people,"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"which would be very distressing if it was."
01:21:51;01:21:54;"So yeah, anyway, shout out to Goblin Influencer."
01:21:54;01:21:57;"I like the spirit of what you're saying."
01:21:57;01:21:59;"Yeah, I mean, it's,"
01:21:59;01:22:03;"whenever people point back to anything on the first album,"
01:22:03;01:22:06;"I think we've done enough with albums two through four"
01:22:06;01:22:07;"that we're definitely not in a position"
01:22:07;01:22:10;"where we'll always live in the shadow of that record."
01:22:10;01:22:12;"Like, I'm not gonna name names, but some people,"
01:22:12;01:22:16;"it's very hard to beat your first record, famously, right?"
01:22:16;01:22:17;"But I think we've done enough"
01:22:17;01:22:20;"that we've had these distinct eras since then"
01:22:20;01:22:23;"that the fact that people still find something"
01:22:23;01:22:26;"to get into or share with music"
01:22:26;01:22:29;"that a lot of which was written when we were students,"
01:22:29;01:22:33;"a lot of which was made before we had any idea"
01:22:33;01:22:36;"that we could ever play a venue bigger"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"than the Mercury Lounge."
01:22:38;01:22:41;"I love that, when people kind of get back into it."

01:23:18;01:23:21;"and I hope the next time that there is a TC-related song"
01:23:21;01:23:24;"that goes viral, as discussed on the show,"
01:23:24;01:23:25;"it should be ""Mountain Breeze,"""
01:23:25;01:23:27;"because that one writes itself."
01:23:27;01:23:30;"You and your friends, Sunday morning, you go for a hike,"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"and then, you know, whatever,"
01:23:32;01:23:33;"like, you guys get in the car or whatever,"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"then you start hiking,"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"and then right when the chorus hits,"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"it's you guys cracking a brew on the top of the mountain"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"with a beautiful vista behind you."
01:23:41;01:23:44;"- Can I actually jump in here and make a call to action?"
01:23:44;01:23:47;"If anybody does make that TikTok,"
01:23:47;01:23:49;"tweet it at us @TimeCrisis2000,"
01:23:49;01:23:51;"we will automatically retweet."
01:23:51;01:23:52;"Let's get this trending, guys."
01:23:52;01:23:54;"Let's make this a real thing."
01:23:54;01:23:59;"Let's bring Jake Longstreth to his natural habitat, TikTok."
01:23:59;01:24:02;"- So far, there's six ""Mountain Breeze"" TikToks."
01:24:02;01:24:03;"They're all for ""Sweet Chili Heat."""
01:24:03;01:24:05;"- They're all for the song ""Sweet Chili Heat""?"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"- Yeah, I think that, yeah,"
01:24:07;01:24:10;"the TC TikTok challenge should be to make--"
01:24:10;01:24:11;"- Yeah, wait, what's some of them?"
01:24:11;01:24:14;"What's happening in the ""Sweet Chili Heat"" ones?"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"- Honestly, it's just somebody shooting videos"
01:24:16;01:24:18;"of their ""Vampire Weekend"" posters,"
01:24:18;01:24:21;"some Bernie, Larry David merchandise."
01:24:21;01:24:22;"They got their dog in it."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"It's unfocused."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"Here's another one. - That's cool."
01:24:26;01:24:27;"- It's cool, I mean, no, it's got a vibe."
01:24:27;01:24:29;"This is the TC challenge."
01:24:29;01:24:31;"You throw on ""Sweet Chili Heat"""
01:24:31;01:24:33;"and shoot your ""Vampire Weekend"" and Bernie posters."
01:24:33;01:24:36;"- And then this guy is doing Kyle's,"
01:24:36;01:24:39;"he's mouthing first one of the evening,"
01:24:39;01:24:44;"and then he's taking a shot of sort of a hot sauce"
01:24:44;01:24:48;"as ""Sweet Chili Heat"" comes on,"
01:24:48;01:24:49;"and it seems hot for him."
01:24:49;01:24:50;"It's a red-hot wing sauce."
01:24:50;01:24:53;"I mean, that's interesting. - Damn."
01:24:53;01:24:55;"See, the song ""Mountain Breeze"" requires people"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"to actually hike up a hill."
01:24:57;01:24:59;"- Right. - This one shot a little,"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"yeah, this one shot a little more sort of artsy."
01:25:01;01:25:02;"It has a filter on it."
01:25:02;01:25:04;"It's in black and white and says,"
01:25:04;01:25:06;"""When that quarantine panic attack hits,"""
01:25:06;01:25:08;"and you're on him for a minute,"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"and then it just says, ""First one of the evening,"""
01:25:10;01:25:12;"and the music comes on, you know, the guitar comes in,"
01:25:12;01:25:15;"and you just sort of slowly pan into his face."
01:25:15;01:25:17;"It's just more vibey."
01:25:17;01:25:21;"And then another one is just an artist's rendition"
01:25:21;01:25:24;"of Jake standing in front of one of his paintings."
01:25:24;01:25:26;"You see him standing in front of it,"
01:25:26;01:25:29;"hanging a painting, and then the Pizza Hut comes in."
01:25:29;01:25:30;"It sort of is, you know what it is?"
01:25:30;01:25:31;"It's a collage. - Oh, oh, no."
01:25:31;01:25:33;"- It's a collage of your paintings."
01:25:33;01:25:36;"- That guy may have, like, a ""Mountain Breeze"" cover."
01:25:36;01:25:37;"I know what you're talking about."
01:25:37;01:25:39;"He posted that on Instagram and tagged me."
01:25:39;01:25:41;"He was a- - Oh, yeah,"
01:25:41;01:25:42;"that was really good. - A collage of an image"
01:25:42;01:25:46;"of me painting with the Pizza Hut and some tree paintings,"
01:25:46;01:25:47;"and he was like, ""This is, like,"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"the 'Mountain Breeze' vinyl cover."""
01:25:49;01:25:53;"- So that is just sort of an animated version of that"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"to the beginning of ""Sweet Chili Heat."""
01:25:55;01:25:56;"So that challenge hasn't taken a while."
01:25:56;01:25:59;"- Also, ""Sweet Chili Heat,"" you know what?"
01:25:59;01:26:00;"I've got a good one for when"
01:26:00;01:26:03;"""Worst Margarita in My Life"" comes out,"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"because I've noticed this trend."
01:26:05;01:26:07;"I see a lot of them on Instagram."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"I mean, I kind of hate it."
01:26:09;01:26:11;"I don't want to encourage it, but it's out there."
01:26:11;01:26:14;"There's this trend of, like, couples pulling pranks"
01:26:14;01:26:16;"on each other on TikTok."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"I guess couples pranking each other."
01:26:17;01:26:20;"Seinfeld, you're our social media expert."
01:26:20;01:26:21;"Back me up."
01:26:21;01:26:22;"This has been going on for years,"
01:26:22;01:26:25;"is couples pranking each other on the internet."
01:26:25;01:26:27;"- Yeah, and I think there's a degree of, like,"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"stagedness to some of them."
01:26:29;01:26:31;"- That's the thing that I hate, is that it's like,"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"we're approaching, as we've discussed on this show"
01:26:33;01:26:37;"many times, just that we live in this weird spectacle."
01:26:37;01:26:41;"So there's these couples, and all they do is make TikToks"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"where they do the newest prank, which is like,"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"oh, somebody gets out of the car,"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"get the, you know, your girlfriend gets in the car,"
01:26:47;01:26:51;"and you say something like, ""Babe, you don't look good today."""
01:26:51;01:26:54;"And she's like, ""Why would you say that?"""
01:26:54;01:26:56;"Or it's like, you get out of the car,"
01:26:56;01:26:59;"like, you're like, ""Hold on, I gotta finish this phone call."
01:26:59;01:27:00;"Yeah, I love her so much."""
01:27:00;01:27:04;"Like, whatever, it's these jokes about the relationship,"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"or sometimes they're like sweet pranks,"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"like where you say something really nice,"
01:27:08;01:27:11;"and they're not supposed to hear it or something."
01:27:11;01:27:12;"But the thing that's so annoying about them"
01:27:12;01:27:15;"is that it's like, a lot of times there's couples"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"that just do these every single day,"
01:27:17;01:27:20;"and they probably don't stage it, is the funny thing."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"Like, they're staged, of course,"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"but it's probably not even like, ""Hey, should we do this?"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"Oh, yeah, let's go out to the car,"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"and I'm gonna do this, and you're gonna do that."""
01:27:27;01:27:29;"It's probably more just that the fabric of their lives"
01:27:29;01:27:33;"is so TikTok-oriented that they just kind of roll with it."
01:27:33;01:27:35;"It's like, every time you get in the car,"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"your boyfriend says some dumb (beep) with you,"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"and as you respond to it,"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"you basically already know it's a TikTok."
01:27:41;01:27:43;"If anything, it's probably harder,"
01:27:43;01:27:45;"rather than having to performatively"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"do the TikTok challenge,"
01:27:47;01:27:50;"you probably have to sometimes get out of that gear."
01:27:50;01:27:51;"So probably you get into the car, and he's like,"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"""Where do you wanna eat today, babe?"""
01:27:53;01:27:56;"And you're just like, ""Uh, I don't know."""
01:27:56;01:27:59;"And he's like, ""Do you wanna go to Arby's?"""
01:27:59;01:28:00;"""I don't know."""
01:28:00;01:28:02;"And then he's kinda like, ""No, no, I'm serious."""
01:28:02;01:28:03;"And you're like, ""Oh, it's not a TikTok challenge?"""
01:28:03;01:28:05;"Like, probably you just live"
01:28:05;01:28:07;"in a permanent TikTok challenge."
01:28:07;01:28:10;"But anyway, even though I think that's kind of"
01:28:10;01:28:12;"a disturbing new element to our society,"
01:28:12;01:28:14;"you know, you can't fight progress,"
01:28:14;01:28:16;"I think one could be, for a couple,"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"and this is actually a real prank, by the way,"
01:28:17;01:28:18;"it's not one of these dumb, like,"
01:28:18;01:28:20;"get in the car and say some weird (beep)."
01:28:20;01:28:23;"So this one is, your partner comes home"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"from a long day of work, and you say,"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"""Hey, I've been working hard all day,"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"""looking up margarita recipes,"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"""and I think I finally cracked it,"
01:28:31;01:28:34;"""and I think I know how to make the best margarita on earth."""
01:28:34;01:28:36;"Except then you put stale Mountain Dew in it."
01:28:36;01:28:37;"And then you're like, ""Hold on one second."""
01:28:37;01:28:39;"You bring it out to them, and then they sip it,"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"and then you gotta see how they react."
01:28:41;01:28:42;"Are they gonna spit it out, and be like,"
01:28:42;01:28:45;"""This is disgusting, this tastes like flat Mountain Dew,"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"""mixed with tequila for a noxious brew."""
01:28:47;01:28:50;"Or are they gonna, you know, try to be nice,"
01:28:50;01:28:52;"and be like, ""Oh, that's really good."""
01:28:52;01:28:54;"Anyway, then you got Worst Margarita in My Life"
01:28:54;01:28:57;"by Mountain Brews playing during it."
01:28:57;01:28:59;"So when that drops, I really encourage people"
01:28:59;01:29:00;"to do that one."
01:29:00;01:29:02;"All right, should we get into the top five?"
01:29:02;01:29:06;"- It's time for the top five, five, five, five, five, five,"
01:29:06;01:29:09;"five on iTunes."
01:29:09;01:29:11;"- On this week's top five, we're gonna be comparing"
01:29:11;01:29:15;"the top Billboard hits of 2020"
01:29:15;01:29:18;"with the top Billboard hits of 2008."
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Why 2008?"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"- Is that when Campus came out?"
01:29:22;01:29:24;"- Yeah, 2008 is the official release of Campus,"
01:29:24;01:29:27;"'cause our first album came out January 2008."
01:29:27;01:29:29;"Although Campus and all those other songs,"
01:29:29;01:29:33;"they were floating around in the previous year."
01:29:33;01:29:35;"But that's interesting, this'll really take me back,"
01:29:35;01:29:39;"'cause I feel like this is a year I remember well."
01:29:39;01:29:43;"And the number five song is a song I remember well,"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"M.I.A., Paper Planes."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"- Well, she had the top five hit."
01:29:47;01:29:48;"- I'm kinda surprised."
01:29:48;01:29:50;"I mean, this is a big hit."
01:29:50;01:29:53;"It made it to number five, it's big."
01:29:53;01:29:54;"- I thought of her as more of like,"
01:29:54;01:29:58;"kind of like a B-org kind of figure, where it's like--"
01:29:58;01:30:01;"- I think this was in the Pineapple Express trailer,"
01:30:01;01:30:02;"and that sort of like-- - That took it"
01:30:02;01:30:03;"to another level."
01:30:03;01:30:04;"- Yeah."
01:30:04;01:30:04;"- But you know what I mean?"
01:30:04;01:30:07;"I thought of her as like, elite indie,"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"but not actually having any mainstream."
01:30:09;01:30:11;"- This was her big song."
01:30:11;01:30:14;"- She's on the new Travis Scott single, ""Franchise."""
01:30:14;01:30:15;"- Are you serious? - Oh, right."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"- Yeah, she's verse three."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"- Again, I've said it on a previous episode,"
01:30:19;01:30:22;"but ""Franchise"" is a great song title."
01:30:22;01:30:24;"And honestly, it sounds like it could have been"
01:30:24;01:30:26;"a song title on the first ""Vampire Weekend."""
01:30:26;01:30:27;"- That just gave me an idea, Jake,"
01:30:27;01:30:30;"for another TikTok challenge,"
01:30:30;01:30:33;"is that if you're a McDonald's franchisee,"
01:30:33;01:30:37;"and you own any McDonald's, you play the song ""Franchise,"""
01:30:37;01:30:40;"and you show off clips of your McDonald's,"
01:30:40;01:30:41;"of your franchise."
01:30:41;01:30:42;"- Hell yeah."
01:30:42;01:30:44;"- Just throwing that out there."
01:30:44;01:30:45;"♪ I own a franchise ♪"
01:30:45;01:30:48;"(laughing)"
01:30:48;01:30:51;"- Try to write an early ""Vampire Weekend"" song."
01:30:51;01:30:54;"♪ I see you, you're walking in my franchise ♪"
01:30:54;01:30:57;"(laughing)"
01:30:57;01:31:00;"- I mean, it ties right in with the mansard roof, right?"
01:31:00;01:31:01;"- Yeah."
01:31:01;01:31:04;"- Well, weren't we gonna do the ""Vampire Weekend"" meal?"
01:31:04;01:31:06;"- Oh, the ""Vampire Weekend"" meal at McDonald's?"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"Did we ever come up with it?"
01:31:08;01:31:09;"- Or it was the Mountain Brew."
01:31:09;01:31:11;"I know Jake had a great Mountain Brews."
01:31:11;01:31:13;"- We had the, yeah, that kind of went off on Twitter,"
01:31:13;01:31:14;"the Mountain Brews meal."
01:31:14;01:31:16;"- That was great."
01:31:16;01:31:19;"- Any burger you want with fries, no drink, plus six pack."
01:31:19;01:31:20;"(laughing)"
01:31:20;01:31:21;"- In the car, right?"
01:31:21;01:31:21;"Six pack."
01:31:21;01:31:23;"(laughing)"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"- The key is the no drink."
01:31:25;01:31:27;"(laughing)"
01:31:27;01:31:31;"- Sir, you'd actually be saving a little bit of money"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"if you ordered the value meal,"
01:31:33;01:31:34;"and it comes with a drink."
01:31:34;01:31:37;"As opposed to ordering the fries and the burger a la carte,"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"you're gonna actually pay a little more."
01:31:39;01:31:40;"I don't care."
01:31:40;01:31:42;"(laughing)"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"- You said it was a watery beer, or a light beer?"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"- I said it was a watery domestic,"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"which is a low-key pavement reference."
01:31:48;01:31:51;"And I did see people on Twitter being like, ""Mudolo!"""
01:31:51;01:31:53;"But I was like, it's a McDonald's meal,"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"it's gotta be American through and through."
01:31:55;01:31:58;"- Oh no, I've missed this."
01:31:58;01:31:59;"- It's gotta be."
01:31:59;01:32:00;"- I've been on Twitter."
01:32:00;01:32:01;"- Somebody made a poster."
01:32:01;01:32:05;"Somebody made the Cactus Jake meal poster."
01:32:05;01:32:06;"- Cactus Jake."
01:32:06;01:32:08;"(laughing)"
01:32:08;01:32:10;"- What's the ""Vampire Weekend"" meal?"
01:32:10;01:32:12;"- I mean, definitely not gonna be able to top that."
01:32:12;01:32:13;"This is perfect."
01:32:13;01:32:17;"- I love this idea that when you order it"
01:32:17;01:32:18;"and they say, ""Any burger you want,"""
01:32:18;01:32:20;"you go, ""Well, which ones?"""
01:32:20;01:32:21;"I don't, it's up to you."
01:32:21;01:32:24;"Well, I just ordered the, I ordered the Jake meal."
01:32:24;01:32:27;"What is it, any one you want."
01:32:27;01:32:29;"Well, I want you to make the decision for me."
01:32:29;01:32:30;"Can't."
01:32:30;01:32:33;"- If you get a really annoying customer"
01:32:33;01:32:34;"who's not willing to pick the burger,"
01:32:34;01:32:37;"the McDonald's employee, all McDonald's employees"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"nationwide will have Jake's cell phone."
01:32:39;01:32:41;"Give him a quick buzz."
01:32:42;01:32:44;"All right, Jake, just pick a burger."
01:32:44;01:32:47;"The Time Crisis meal would definitely be"
01:32:47;01:32:48;"an off-season McRib."
01:32:48;01:32:50;"- Oh, hell yeah."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"- 'Cause you roll up when they don't have the McRib."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"But if you order the Time Crisis meal,"
01:32:54;01:32:57;"they're legally obligated to go defrost a McRib for you."
01:32:57;01:33:00;"Even when it's not the season."
01:33:00;01:33:02;"Here's my idea for the ""Vampire Weekend"" meal."
01:33:02;01:33:04;"It's the Travis Scott meal,"
01:33:04;01:33:07;"because obviously I wanna piggyback off of what he's doing."
01:33:07;01:33:11;"And I think where he sits as a musician"
01:33:11;01:33:13;"and all these things he's bringing together,"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"I legitimately do find fascinating."
01:33:15;01:33:17;"So I don't wanna start from scratch."
01:33:17;01:33:19;"We need to be tied to his heat."
01:33:19;01:33:21;"So it's the Travis Scott meal,"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"except instead of barbecue sauce for the fries,"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"you get ketchup."
01:33:25;01:33:28;"And on the quarter pounder, there's no bacon."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"(laughing)"
01:33:30;01:33:32;"And the beverage instead of being a Sprite is a Coke."
01:33:32;01:33:36;"- So that's it."
01:33:36;01:33:37;"It's the quarter pounder meal."
01:33:37;01:33:39;"You've rebranded."
01:33:40;01:33:42;"- And the soda is up to you."
01:33:42;01:33:45;"- Yeah, and the soda's up to you."
01:33:45;01:33:48;"We recommend Coke, but if you wanna get Sprite,"
01:33:48;01:33:50;"diet Coke, you know, that's all fine."
01:33:50;01:33:51;"I was thinking about this more"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"because we were called Travis Scott."
01:33:53;01:33:57;"He was like the inverted negative spectacle,"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"poor hazy and whatever."
01:33:59;01:33:59;"It made me think,"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"have we ever talked about this on Time Crisis?"
01:34:01;01:34:05;"'Cause I always think about this and it always comes up."
01:34:05;01:34:05;"I feel like we were just talking about it"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"in the studio the other day."
01:34:07;01:34:09;"I guess it was a meme, whatever."
01:34:09;01:34:11;"It was something being passed around on the internet"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"where somebody wrote,"
01:34:13;01:34:14;"I don't know if they're a gamer or what,"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"but they wrote a thing about Waluigi."
01:34:16;01:34:18;"It's kind of like an internet classic"
01:34:18;01:34:19;"'cause they really broke it down"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"in this deeply philosophical way"
01:34:21;01:34:23;"where they're basically saying how"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"there's Mario and Luigi, right?"
01:34:25;01:34:26;"Mario's the hero"
01:34:26;01:34:29;"and Luigi is kind of his random ass sidekick."
01:34:29;01:34:33;"He represents this kind of complimentary nobody,"
01:34:33;01:34:38;"but who exists to kind of provide a context for Mario."
01:34:38;01:34:42;"And then you have Wario, who's the evil Mario,"
01:34:42;01:34:43;"the inverted Mario."
01:34:43;01:34:44;"And we can understand that."
01:34:44;01:34:45;"What's the opposite of a hero?"
01:34:45;01:34:47;"It's a villain."
01:34:47;01:34:51;"But then there's also this character called Waluigi,"
01:34:51;01:34:54;"who's as Wario is to Mario, Waluigi is to Luigi."
01:34:54;01:34:56;"And so somebody wrote this thing."
01:34:56;01:34:58;"I always used to see it getting passed around"
01:34:58;01:35:00;"that was this kind of brilliant take"
01:35:00;01:35:03;"that Luigi already is this nobody man."
01:35:03;01:35:07;"So Waluigi truly represents inverted negative space."
01:35:07;01:35:09;"He's like the opposite of nothing."
01:35:09;01:35:11;"He's like the double nothing man."
01:35:11;01:35:13;"And they made a joke about how"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"he doesn't even get an elegant name like Wario."
01:35:15;01:35:18;"They just stick the Wa on top of the Luigi."
01:35:18;01:35:20;"Later people said that in Japanese,"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"Waluigi actually is kind of witty or something."
01:35:22;01:35:24;"I don't know."
01:35:24;01:35:27;"But anyway, this idea of in this meme or whatever,"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"it was like this, you know,"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"a kind of like brilliant philosophical treatise"
01:35:31;01:35:35;"about how Waluigi is like the opposite of nothing."
01:35:35;01:35:37;"And you know, it struck a chord with people."
01:35:37;01:35:40;"It's inverted negative space, whatever you want to call it."
01:35:40;01:35:43;"It's like that deep chasm."
01:35:43;01:35:45;"And I think a lot of us feel like Waluigi sometimes."
01:35:45;01:35:48;"We already feel like we're not the main character."
01:35:48;01:35:50;"And sometimes we even feel like the opposite"
01:35:50;01:35:53;"of the guy who's not the main character."
01:35:53;01:35:54;"You know what I mean?"
01:35:54;01:35:56;"It's like a black hole of identity."
01:35:56;01:35:57;"- Damn."
01:35:57;01:35:58;"- And I kind of like the idea that the"
01:35:58;01:36:01;"Vampire Weekend meal is like the Waluigi"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"to the Travis Scott's Mario."
01:36:03;01:36:05;"Vampire Weekend had a taco once"
01:36:05;01:36:09;"to raise money for the homeless at Home State Tacos."
01:36:09;01:36:10;"- Oh yeah."
01:36:10;01:36:10;"- In LA."
01:36:10;01:36:12;"And it was a great taco."
01:36:12;01:36:15;"They're really nice people who run Home State,"
01:36:15;01:36:15;"shout out to them."
01:36:15;01:36:18;"And they do a kind of a program where,"
01:36:18;01:36:19;"I don't know if it's a monthly thing or what,"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"but they always team up with artists"
01:36:21;01:36:23;"and they design a taco."
01:36:23;01:36:25;"You have to sign off on it though."
01:36:25;01:36:26;"Somehow it came up recently and somebody's asking me,"
01:36:26;01:36:29;"do you like really R&D that taco?"
01:36:29;01:36:30;"I was like, nah."
01:36:30;01:36:30;"I think we might've said,"
01:36:30;01:36:33;"let's make it vegetarian or vegan."
01:36:33;01:36:35;"Even though I'm not vegan."
01:36:35;01:36:35;"I was just kind of like,"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"we're gonna throw our name on something."
01:36:37;01:36:40;"You know, maybe get a good vegan taco out there."
01:36:40;01:36:41;"And then they came up with it and it tasted great."
01:36:41;01:36:45;"And it's a program they do to raise money"
01:36:45;01:36:48;"for an organization that helps the homeless in LA."
01:36:48;01:36:51;"So that's the only time we've done a food thing like that."
01:36:51;01:36:53;"But I would like to do more."
01:36:53;01:36:55;"I mean, I always felt more passionately"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"about Taco Bell than McDonald's."
01:36:57;01:36:59;"Maybe Taco Bell would be down for a Vampire Weekend meal."
01:36:59;01:37:00;"- Oh, for sure."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"- Maybe you gotta start feeling it out."
01:37:02;01:37:05;"Like if there's any people who work in the fast food"
01:37:05;01:37:08;"industry, especially on the marketing PR side,"
01:37:08;01:37:12;"and you're looking to compete with Travis Scott."
01:37:12;01:37:15;"I mean, we could really make something special"
01:37:15;01:37:18;"because not only does Vampire Weekend have four albums"
01:37:18;01:37:20;"in stores now, we could use the musical side."
01:37:20;01:37:24;"If we really kind of call in the power of time crisis,"
01:37:24;01:37:26;"we could be talking about this for months."
01:37:26;01:37:28;"Anyway, that was MIA with Paper Planes."
01:37:28;01:37:29;"Great song."
01:37:29;01:37:30;"Moving on."
01:37:30;01:37:35;"The number five song right now is 24K Golden,"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"Mood featuring Ian Dior."
01:37:37;01:37:41;"Wait, I feel like we heard this before."
01:37:41;01:37:43;"Oh yeah, guitar."
01:37:43;01:37:44;"- Wait, who's the artist?"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"- 24K Golden."
01:37:46;01:37:50;"His real name is Golden Landis Von Jones from SF."

01:38:48;01:38:49;"- No, no, no."
01:38:49;01:38:51;"He's just like, what is it?"
01:38:51;01:38:52;"I'm not here to order you around."
01:38:52;01:38:55;"I'm not here to like constrict you in your lifestyle."
01:38:55;01:38:57;"Like we're supposed to be boyfriend and girlfriend"
01:38:57;01:39:00;"and you're like assuming I have this like"
01:39:00;01:39:02;"patriarchal relationship with you."
01:39:02;01:39:06;"- I didn't impregnate your mother and give birth to you."
01:39:06;01:39:12;"- Yeah, I mean, maybe there's also an age gap."
01:39:12;01:39:16;"Maybe he's like, you know, in his mid late thirties"
01:39:16;01:39:19;"and he's dating someone that's, you know, 22."
01:39:19;01:39:21;"- He's 60."
01:39:21;01:39:23;"She's like."
01:39:23;01:39:26;"- In his narrative, this 18 year old singer"
01:39:26;01:39:27;"in his mid thirties."
01:39:27;01:39:32;"I like that."
01:39:32;01:39:33;"- He's friendly with the dad."
01:39:33;01:39:36;"- He bears an uncanny resemblance to the dad"
01:39:36;01:39:38;"that are often getting mixed up."
01:39:38;01:39:40;"- It's funny too, because the hook is"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"why you always in a mood."
01:39:42;01:39:45;"That actually sounds like something that a parent might say."
01:39:45;01:39:47;"- So yeah, like you're in a mood to this."
01:39:47;01:39:49;"- Oh, don't mind them."
01:39:49;01:39:50;"They're just going through."
01:39:50;01:39:51;"This is how they are now."
01:39:51;01:39:52;"Okay."
01:39:52;01:39:54;"What's the latest drama?"
01:39:54;01:39:56;"- Why you always in a mood?"
01:39:56;01:39:58;"- I'm always like, God, you're in a mood today."
01:39:58;01:40:00;"- Aren't you in a mood?"
01:40:00;01:40:02;"- So this guy's acting an awful lot like her dad."
01:40:02;01:40:04;"- Maybe he's just saying, I know I'm acting like your dad."
01:40:04;01:40:05;"I just want to clarify."
01:40:05;01:40:06;"I'm not your dad."
01:40:06;01:40:08;"- I like my theory that he's like doing"
01:40:08;01:40:09;"like a Springsteen thing."
01:40:09;01:40:12;"He's assuming the character."
01:40:12;01:40:13;"- Right."
01:40:13;01:40:14;"But I'm not your dad."
01:40:14;01:40:16;"I might look like your dad, but I'm not your dad."
01:40:16;01:40:20;"The number four song in 2008, Rihanna, Disturbia."
01:40:20;01:40:23;"- Was this related to that movie?"
01:40:23;01:40:25;"- I've always wondered that."
01:40:25;01:40:27;"It must be like inspired by it."
01:40:27;01:40:28;"- Yeah."
01:40:28;01:40:29;"I think they came out around the same time."
01:40:29;01:40:30;"- What year is that movie?"
01:40:33;01:40:38;"- Wait, Disturbia was 2007."
01:40:38;01:40:41;"Early Shia."
01:40:41;01:40:43;"- So Chris Brown wrote this song."
01:40:43;01:40:45;"Is this when they were a couple?"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"- Is this one of Rihanna's first big hits?"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"- Well, Umbrella was before this."
01:40:49;01:40:52;"That was her first like massive hit, but yeah."
01:40:52;01:40:53;"This is like when she was becoming"
01:40:53;01:40:55;"one of the biggest artists in the world."
01:40:55;01:40:57;"- Yeah, I don't think she really crossed my desk"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"till like 2010."
01:40:59;01:41:02;"- You don't remember when Umbrella dropped?"
01:41:02;01:41:03;"- Impossible."
01:41:03;01:41:06;"- I probably heard the song, but I don't think I rec,"
01:41:06;01:41:10;"I don't think she as a pop star like entered my consciousness"
01:41:10;01:41:12;"until the song that was,"
01:41:12;01:41:17;"the one about falling in love in an office space."
01:41:17;01:41:20;"♪ We fell in love in an office space ♪"

01:41:21;01:41:23;"(laughing)"
01:41:23;01:41:28;"- I guess this is like a thriller type song"
01:41:28;01:41:30;"using kind of like horror imagery."
01:41:30;01:41:34;"I'm just curious how they use the word Disturbia."
01:41:34;01:41:37;"- Inspired by the word Disturbia."
01:41:37;01:41:39;"- When also Disturbia is by the way,"
01:41:39;01:41:43;"a portmanteau of disturbing and suburbia."
01:41:43;01:41:47;"So like in any ways, the song related to like the concept"
01:41:47;01:41:50;"of like the dark side of suburbia."
01:41:50;01:41:52;"Your mind is in Disturbia."
01:41:52;01:41:54;"It's like the darkness is the light Disturbia."
01:41:54;01:41:56;"Am I scaring you tonight?"
01:41:56;01:41:57;"Your mind is in Disturbia."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"Ain't used to what you like."
01:41:58;01:42:00;"Disturbia, Disturbia."
01:42:00;01:42:03;"- I think they're just using the word as a way to say"
01:42:03;01:42:07;"like psychosis or some form of dementia."
01:42:07;01:42:10;"I don't think they've stuck to the Shia LaBeouf"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"definition at all."
01:42:12;01:42:13;"- It's a thief in the night to come and get."
01:42:13;01:42:15;"Yeah, it's just like a kind of a spooky song."
01:42:15;01:42:18;"The number four song right now,"
01:42:18;01:42:22;"Drake, ""Laugh Now, Cry Later"" featuring Lil' Jerk."

01:42:26;01:42:28;"That's him just horsing around at the Nike headquarters"
01:42:28;01:42:29;"in Beaverton, Oregon."
01:42:29;01:42:31;"It's a good video."
01:42:31;01:42:32;"It's fun."
01:42:32;01:42:37;"And there's a lot of him just looking at the camera"

01:43:05;01:43:08;"Like the very simple hook of just like saying baby"

01:43:15;01:43:20;"Disturbia was recorded in Denver, Colorado in April, 2008."
01:43:20;01:43:21;"- Really?"
01:43:21;01:43:22;"I wonder why Denver?"
01:43:22;01:43:23;"I wonder if they're on tour."
01:43:23;01:43:24;"- I bet."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"- And also the first song we listened to,"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"that guy's first name was Golden."
01:43:28;01:43:30;"This is getting spooky, like Golden, Colorado."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"The number two song--"
01:43:31;01:43:34;"- She said the song, sorry, I just wanted to,"
01:43:34;01:43:36;"it's not about a specific personal experience,"
01:43:36;01:43:38;"but rather the general feelings of mental anguish,"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"anxiety, and confusion."
01:43:40;01:43:42;"- Yeah, Disturbia."
01:43:42;01:43:44;"- No references to the film."
01:43:44;01:43:45;"- Right."
01:43:45;01:43:46;"- Anyway."
01:43:46;01:43:48;"- Another kind of spooky song in 2008."
01:43:48;01:43:50;"I guess 2008 was still kind of a spooky year"
01:43:50;01:43:54;"'cause that M.I.A. Paper Planes,"
01:43:54;01:43:55;"we didn't really talk about it,"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"but it's got that Clash Straight to Hell sample,"
01:43:57;01:44:01;"which is kind of like sad and weird and eerie,"
01:44:01;01:44:02;"Disturbia, spooky."
01:44:02;01:44:04;"And then this song was very spooky."
01:44:04;01:44:07;"Kanye West, Love Lockdown"

01:44:15;01:44:17;"just being like, this is cool."
01:44:17;01:44:20;"- Did these songs come out post your recession,"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"market crash?"
01:44:22;01:44:23;"- I don't think so,"
01:44:23;01:44:25;"'cause I think the market crash turns like that."
01:44:25;01:44:27;"Well, when did the market crash?"
01:44:27;01:44:28;"Right around now."
01:44:28;01:44:29;"- That was late September."
01:44:29;01:44:31;"I wanna say late September."

01:44:56;01:45:00;"- Lehman Brothers went bankrupt September 15th, 2008."
01:45:00;01:45:03;"- Whoa, and this song came out three days later."
01:45:03;01:45:04;"- That was weird at the time."
01:45:04;01:45:07;"It was like, what's happening?"
01:45:07;01:45:09;"- Well, and especially because"
01:45:09;01:45:11;"his first three albums were just like hip hop,"
01:45:11;01:45:14;"with like soul samples and rapping."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"And this song just like was kind of different,"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"vocally, beat-wise."
01:45:18;01:45:22;"- I was talking about the financial crisis."
01:45:22;01:45:24;"- What were you saying about the financial crisis?"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"- I was just saying like, at the time,"
01:45:26;01:45:27;"I was just reflecting on it."
01:45:27;01:45:29;"I was just like, at the time,"
01:45:29;01:45:31;"I was sort of like, what the hell's happening?"
01:45:31;01:45:33;"- Oh, I thought you just meant as a Kanye fan"
01:45:33;01:45:34;"when ""Love Lockdown"" dropped."
01:45:34;01:45:36;"- We hadn't seen the big short yet."
01:45:36;01:45:37;"They were throwing around terms,"
01:45:37;01:45:39;"like we were joking about this last episode."
01:45:39;01:45:41;"They were throwing around terms like"
01:45:41;01:45:44;"tranches and bundling these,"
01:45:44;01:45:47;"mortgages broken up into millions of pieces,"
01:45:47;01:45:49;"that whole concept."
01:45:49;01:45:51;"But it was sort of just like, what?"
01:45:51;01:45:54;"- Yeah, Jim Cramer slamming buttons"
01:45:54;01:45:57;"and screaming at you through the TV."
01:45:57;01:46:00;"- It was just like, it's such esoteric knowledge."
01:46:00;01:46:00;"How this even happened. - It was just like,"
01:46:00;01:46:02;"what the hell is happening?"
01:46:02;01:46:05;"- I mean, I remember when Lehman Brothers went under,"
01:46:05;01:46:07;"there were like some disturbing images of like,"
01:46:07;01:46:09;"the office being kind of (beep) up and in disarray."
01:46:09;01:46:10;"And you were just like, oh, (beep)"
01:46:10;01:46:13;"this is about to turn into something big."
01:46:13;01:46:16;"And, you know, in classic American fashion,"
01:46:16;01:46:20;"they always know how to keep things at like that low boil."
01:46:20;01:46:21;"- The cusp, right."
01:46:21;01:46:24;"- The cusp, where disturbing things are happening,"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"everybody feels uneasy,"
01:46:26;01:46:28;"and you're waiting for it to fully boil over."
01:46:28;01:46:31;"Maybe a little bit of water here or there happens,"
01:46:31;01:46:33;"but it's never like the full pot goes crazy"
01:46:33;01:46:36;"and the flame gets it and everything, you know?"
01:46:36;01:46:38;"Constantly at that low boil."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"And I think Kanye really tapped into that"
01:46:39;01:46:41;"with ""Love Lockdown."""
01:46:41;01:46:41;"- I mean, you're totally right."
01:46:41;01:46:43;"I remember at the time,"
01:46:43;01:46:44;"I had been a fan of the first two records."
01:46:44;01:46:47;"I was not down with 808s."
01:46:47;01:46:48;"- Same."
01:46:48;01:46:49;"- Oh, really? - I was like,"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"this sucks."
01:46:51;01:46:52;"Like, I just."
01:46:52;01:46:53;"- It took me a while."
01:46:53;01:46:54;"It took me a while to come around to it."
01:46:54;01:46:55;"- Same."
01:46:55;01:46:56;"- Very acquired taste, yeah."
01:46:56;01:46:57;"- Oh, really?"
01:46:57;01:46:58;"All three of you guys?"
01:46:58;01:47:00;"- I've never felt more wrong in hindsight."
01:47:00;01:47:03;"- Wow, I'm feeling a lot of disturbia to know that"
01:47:03;01:47:05;"the whole TC crew was like that"
01:47:05;01:47:09;"because I was a big Kanye fan since the first album."
01:47:09;01:47:11;"And when that came out, I was like,"
01:47:11;01:47:12;"I knew I bet on the right horse."
01:47:12;01:47:15;"(laughing)"
01:47:15;01:47:17;"I remember when the third album came out,"
01:47:17;01:47:18;"you would still get people just being like,"
01:47:18;01:47:20;"oh, that guy's annoying."
01:47:20;01:47:21;"He's so full of himself."
01:47:21;01:47:24;"Why is he so much better than anybody else?"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"And I remember just being like, come on."
01:47:26;01:47:26;"These albums are like great."
01:47:26;01:47:29;"And when that, I really felt when that came out,"
01:47:29;01:47:32;"maybe because it reminded me of the X-Men theme song,"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"♪ Diddly-loo-loo-loo ♪"
01:47:34;01:47:35;"Which in a very oblique way,"
01:47:35;01:47:37;"it doesn't actually sound like it."
01:47:37;01:47:40;"I really felt like, oh yeah, he is the chosen one."
01:47:40;01:47:43;"But yeah, that was his big classic fourth album leap."
01:47:43;01:47:47;"Like he was on some different (beep)"
01:47:47;01:47:47;"You know what?"
01:47:47;01:47:51;"I saw him on tour on that album was the glow in the dark tour"
01:47:51;01:47:53;"and Rihanna opened for him."
01:47:53;01:47:55;"- Oh, wow."
01:47:55;01:47:57;"- Maybe like Pharrell was there too."
01:47:57;01:47:58;"Definitely Rihanna was there."
01:47:58;01:48:00;"- I thought that was his third album."
01:48:00;01:48:01;"- No, this is his fourth."
01:48:01;01:48:05;"He had his trilogy of college, dropout,"
01:48:05;01:48:07;"late registration and graduation."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"- Oh, that's right."
01:48:09;01:48:12;"- And then there was the long rumored fourth album,"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"which would have continued the trajectory"
01:48:14;01:48:16;"that was called good-ass job."
01:48:16;01:48:19;"Because after you graduate, then you get a good-ass job."
01:48:19;01:48:20;"That's how Kanye said it."
01:48:20;01:48:23;"But then he decided to cut it off as a trilogy"
01:48:23;01:48:25;"and not take us towards that good-ass job place."
01:48:25;01:48:28;"And instead take us to the austere,"
01:48:28;01:48:31;"disturbed world of Veda Waites and Heartbreak,"
01:48:31;01:48:33;"which was very jarring."
01:48:33;01:48:34;"But then that was a cool tour."
01:48:34;01:48:38;"He was alone on stage on like this Martian terrain."
01:48:38;01:48:40;"And he was like talking to a robot the whole time"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"on like some 2001 (beep)"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"And also I feel like when I saw that,"
01:48:44;01:48:46;"it really came together that I was like, oh yeah."
01:48:46;01:48:48;"Like I really did have that feeling of like, oh yeah,"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"this guy's on some wild (beep)"
01:48:50;01:48:54;"Because Rihanna performed kind of like,"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"she's cool, super cool, but like a pretty normal pop show."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"And then he came on, he's alone."
01:48:58;01:49:01;"And he's like stumbling around on the Martian territory."
01:49:01;01:49:03;"And then this thing comes down and it's like,"
01:49:03;01:49:07;"Mr. West, your spaceship has crash landed on Mars."
01:49:07;01:49:08;"There's not enough."
01:49:08;01:49:10;"And he's like, I gotta get back to Earth."
01:49:10;01:49:12;"They're like, there's not enough fuel to get back."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"He's like, what am I gonna do?"
01:49:14;01:49:15;"Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun."
01:49:15;01:49:17;"And like the songs would come in."
01:49:17;01:49:19;"It was this bizarre one man show."
01:49:19;01:49:22;"And I was like, this is some wild (beep)"
01:49:22;01:49:26;"Next song, number three right now"

01:49:43;01:49:45;"He's like working in like an oil field or something."

01:52:51;01:52:53;"there's always a trapeze."

01:52:54;01:52:56;"there's a lot of circus stuff."

01:53:11;01:53:13;"- Oh yeah."
01:53:13;01:53:15;"- I feel like there's also kind of a sailor vibe"
01:53:15;01:53:16;"to this somehow."
01:53:16;01:53:18;"- Oh yeah, I feel that. - Kind of a shanty vibe."

01:53:20;01:53:23;"There's like something in common."
01:53:23;01:53:26;"Sailors are also up climbing poles"
01:53:26;01:53:28;"and swinging from things."
01:53:28;01:53:32;"And also, I think, well, if you're into circus vibes,"
01:53:32;01:53:34;"you're also into like pirate vibes."
01:53:34;01:53:38;"I think also like the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies"
01:53:38;01:53:40;"were really big in this era."
01:53:40;01:53:44;"And I bet for a lot of people who wanted to go full"

01:53:46;01:53:48;"might've felt like a pirate. - Or landlocked."
01:53:48;01:53:50;"- Yeah, they were landlocked."
01:53:50;01:53:52;"So they're like, ""I can't go full pirate."
01:53:52;01:53:53;"How am I gonna pull this off?"""
01:53:53;01:53:55;"And then they're like, ""Oh, I could go kind of circus."""
01:53:55;01:53:58;"It weirdly presses, you know,"
01:53:58;01:53:59;"hits a lot of the same notes."
01:53:59;01:54:01;"- Are you saying that there's a kinship"
01:54:01;01:54:03;"between pirates and clowns"
01:54:03;01:54:06;"versus like the animosity between like"
01:54:06;01:54:07;"policemen and firemen?"
01:54:07;01:54:10;"- Policemen and firefighters owe deeply."
01:54:10;01:54:12;"Yeah, I think they're natural allies."
01:54:12;01:54:14;"They're almost like, I feel like this would be"
01:54:14;01:54:15;"some kind of like ""Game of Thrones"""
01:54:15;01:54:17;"or ""Lord of the Rings"" type thing"
01:54:17;01:54:19;"where there's two groups who are kind of like"
01:54:19;01:54:23;"ancient allies and they don't call on each other very often."
01:54:23;01:54:26;"But if they do, it's kind of understood"
01:54:26;01:54:29;"that there's like a sacred pact going back generations"
01:54:29;01:54:32;"that's like, my great-grandchildren,"
01:54:32;01:54:34;"let's say great-great-grandchildren,"
01:54:34;01:54:36;"we're all gone from the face of this earth."
01:54:36;01:54:41;"It's whatever kind of hellscape, you know, 2150 US is."
01:54:42;01:54:45;"But if my great-great-grandchildren"
01:54:45;01:54:48;"somehow tracked down Jake's great-great-grandchildren"
01:54:48;01:54:51;"and said like, I wanna do an internet radio show with you,"
01:54:51;01:54:54;"there would be that kind of like ancient obligation"
01:54:54;01:54:57;"where they might be like, whoa, what's this all about?"
01:54:57;01:54:58;"And then they might be like, oh yeah, I've heard about this."
01:54:58;01:55:01;"I've heard that our ancestors, you know."
01:55:01;01:55:02;"Anyway, so that always happens"

01:55:04;01:55:06;"If pirates ever needed to come to land,"
01:55:06;01:55:09;"I think the circus folk would be obligated"

02:03:22;02:03:23;"- Oh, absolutely."
02:03:23;02:03:24;"- And might weigh heavily on them."
02:03:24;02:03:26;"- Does BTS stand for something?"
02:03:26;02:03:28;"- That's a great question."
02:03:28;02:03:31;"And it's amazing that it took us this long to come to it."

02:03:43;02:03:47;"- BTS is short for the Bangtan Boys."
02:03:47;02:03:49;"- What's Bangtan?"
02:03:49;02:03:50;"Is that a place? - That's a good question too."
02:03:50;02:03:53;"- Oh, there's seven guys in this band."
02:03:53;02:03:53;"- Let's find out."
02:03:53;02:03:55;"- Oh, yeah."
02:03:55;02:03:58;"- Or in Korean, I'm not gonna try to say this actually,"
02:03:58;02:04:03;"but there's another phrase that, let's see, Bangtan."
02:04:03;02:04:09;"It seems like it's a word that's specific to,"
02:04:09;02:04:11;"I can't find any other context for this word."
02:04:11;02:04:14;"- Okay, but something about Bangtan Boys"
02:04:14;02:04:16;"and Bangtan might be a place."
02:04:16;02:04:18;"Bangtan is a Korean word to describe"
02:04:18;02:04:23;"kind of people who are very big fans of 90s indie rock."
02:04:23;02:04:25;"- Yeah."
02:04:25;02:04:27;"- So weirdly, there is a built-to-spell connection,"
02:04:27;02:04:28;"but it's not what you think."
02:04:28;02:04:29;"- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
02:04:29;02:04:32;"Wait, I've looked it up again."
02:04:32;02:04:36;"Okay, the literal translation of BTS,"
02:04:36;02:04:39;"the Korean, like the full word of Korean BTS"
02:04:39;02:04:42;"means Bulletproof Boy Scouts."
02:04:42;02:04:43;"- That's sick."
02:04:43;02:04:44;"That sounds like a punk band."
02:04:44;02:04:45;"- Yeah, it's kind of,"
02:04:45;02:04:48;"or a little bit Ghostface Killah somehow."
02:04:48;02:04:49;"- Right, that could be like Ghostface Killah,"
02:04:49;02:04:54;"like epic song from 2007."
02:04:54;02:04:56;"- Yeah, yeah."
02:04:56;02:04:58;"- Well, congratulations to BTS"
02:04:58;02:05:00;"on being the first Korean band in history"
02:05:00;02:05:02;"to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100."
02:05:02;02:05:03;"It's a good song."
