00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis back once again. Jake and I reunite in late January to discuss the"
00:08;00:13;"topics of the day. We'll be joined by Carson Mel, creator of the new TBS"
00:13;00:19;"cartoon Tarantula. We'll also dig into the listener email bag, count down the"
00:19;00:26;"hits of 1987, and discuss a very controversial topic. Pepperidge Farm"
00:26;00:34;"Goldfish. This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:19;01:26;"Time Crisis, second one of 2018. Can you believe it? We're already like deep into"
01:26;01:35;"2018. Week four. Crazy. How you doing Jake? How you enjoy that beer? Um, pretty buzzed."
01:35;01:42;"First beer of 2018 for me. So for people who didn't listen to the last show, how long"
01:42;01:47;"did you take off from drinking? Three weeks? Not even that long. Because you went"
01:47;01:51;"hard on New Year's at the Richard Pictures Grateful Dead show? Moderately"
01:51;01:55;"hard. So then you woke up January 1st and you're like I'm taking the month off."
01:55;02:01;"Yeah. So even just taking a few weeks off from drinking, that your first beer, you"
02:01;02:04;"really feeling it? Yeah, I'm surprised actually. Because we talked about last"
02:04;02:08;"time that you're a moderate to heavy drinker. That's true. What was it? Two to"
02:08;02:14;"three a night? Two to three a night. That's moderate. Is that heavy? I don't"
02:14;02:20;"like to think of myself as a heavy drinker. That's sad. I'm not shaming you"
02:20;02:26;"because you always have your s*** together, but hold on. What's the definition of a"
02:26;02:30;"heavy drinker? Yeah, exactly. And also it's probably worth noting that alcoholism and"
02:30;02:36;"heavy drinking are not synonymous. True that. So the first definition we found"
02:36;02:42;"from the NIH defines heavy alcohol use as binge drinking on five or more days"
02:42;02:48;"in the past month. Okay, but what is binge drinking? I don't binge drink. Yeah, two"
02:48;02:52;"to three drinks doesn't sound like binge drinking. No, binge drinking is like probably like five or more."
02:52;02:57;"Six. We're on the NIH website. Okay. This is what our government really thinks"
02:57;03:03;"about alcohol. Specifically the NIH has something called NIA, the National"
03:03;03:06;"Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. This is valuable information for us all"
03:06;03:13;"to have. So NIA defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings blood"
03:13;03:20;"alcohol concentration levels to 0.08 g/dL. This is classic. It's like so"
03:20;03:24;"unhelpful. You go to this government website to like get some insight and"
03:24;03:27;"they're just like, it's real technical. Government doesn't solve problems."
03:27;03:32;"Government is the problem. Okay, hold on. Just get government out of my way. So this typically occurs"
03:32;03:36;"after four drinks for women and five drinks for men in about two hours. How"
03:36;03:45;"often are you having five drinks in two hours? Never. Two hours? That's crazy. It's no joke"
03:45;03:48;"though. I mean I was looking at this chart of like how much people drink and"
03:48;03:53;"the vast majority of people drink very little. Yeah. Then there's that top 10% of"
03:53;03:59;"drinkers drink it. It's like unbelievable. Right. I'm doing my 2.5 a night."
03:59;04:05;"Over like a three to four hour period. That's not binge drinking. Far from it."
04:05;04:10;"The point is I haven't had a drink in 23 days or whatever. Do you feel better? I"
04:10;04:17;"sleep better. I'll say that. Okay. I lost probably four pounds and I sleep better."
04:17;04:22;"So that's something to consider going forward. But I just had one beer and I'm"
04:22;04:25;"feeling it right now."
04:25;04:37;"One scotch and one bill. One bourbon, one scotch and one bill."
04:37;04:52;"Hey Mr. Bartender, come here. I want another drink and I want it now. My baby she gone, she been gone tonight. I ain't seen my baby since night of full light."
04:52;04:58;"One bourbon, one scotch and one bill."
04:58;05:04;"So we got some great listener emails. We got a lot of fun stuff on the show. We're"
05:04;05:08;"gonna talk about your Sundance trip. We're gonna talk about the new TV show"
05:08;05:13;"Tarantula. Got your buddy Carson calling in, the creator. But first we've gotten so"
05:13;05:18;"many good emails lately. Yeah. The mailbag is popping. And also I want to point out,"
05:18;05:23;"I know I always say this, but we get so many great emails that anybody who sent"
05:23;05:25;"us an email we didn't read it. It's not because we didn't think was a good email."
05:25;05:29;"Because we just have too many. And we don't do emails every show. No. Let's"
05:29;05:41;"start by doing a callback. Corporate food history. Let's talk about it. On the last"
05:41;05:47;"show we got into a kind of fierce debate about $5 footlongs. Right. Could you make"
05:47;05:53;"a footlong at home with store-bought ingredients for under $5? It's a serious"
05:53;05:57;"issue because what we're really talking about is can you save significant"
05:57;06:01;"amounts of money by making your own food and still eating decently? And not going"
06:01;06:06;"to Subway. Because it's important for us to believe that making your own food,"
06:06;06:12;"doing meal prep, will allow you to significantly save money versus going out."
06:12;06:17;"Because if you can't, then you're trapped. That's the serious side. The funny side"
06:17;06:22;"to me is just this image of like every day every family member gets one footlong."
06:22;06:29;"Not a sandwich. Ezra's up at 7 a.m. just making footlongs. Just slaving in the"
06:29;06:35;"kitchen. Did you finish your footlong? Oh, I only could eat six inches, dad. You're"
06:35;06:39;"gonna sit there till you take down the other six. I did not spend my entire"
06:39;06:44;"Sunday prepping footlongs for the week. Also, that's so gross. Like eating a"
06:44;06:50;"sandwich that's like four days old on Thursday. Isn't that bad? You can't eat a"
06:50;06:54;"sandwich that's been sitting in the fridge for like a day. Well, so we got"
06:54;06:59;"some emails because we asked the Time Crisis listeners about this. So first of"
06:59;07:04;"all, here's a short one. Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag. This one comes from"
07:04;07:08;"Amanda Frank. She listened to last week's show and she emailed Time Crisis saying"
07:08;07:12;"$5 footlong could be a loss leader. I believe we've talked about this concept"
07:12;07:17;"before on the show. For whatever reason, ""loss leader"" entered my vocabulary at"
07:17;07:21;"some point and I say it constantly. I guess for a lot of people it's like a"
07:21;07:25;"very typical phrase but every once in a while somebody's like, ""what are you"
07:25;07:31;"talking?"" because it is a slightly weird marketing technical term. It's kind of jargon. So I'm"
07:31;07:36;"gonna explain off the top of my head what I believe a loss leader is. Yeah. My"
07:36;07:41;"understanding is a loss leader is any kind of product or service that a"
07:41;07:46;"company offers. Knowing full well on that individual item, they will lose money."
07:46;07:53;"Hence the loss. But it serves the greater good because it gets people in the store"
07:53;07:58;"perhaps. It engages them with the corporation. So in the case of $5"
07:58;08:02;"footlongs, you're trying to build an army of loyal customers. Well, you're also"
08:02;08:06;"making money on the SunChips that you sell for $1.29 a bag. Well, exactly."
08:06;08:12;"And the Diet Coke. So maybe Subway's taking a big L on the $5 footlong. Maybe"
08:12;08:17;"the $5 footlong costs $6 to make and they're losing a dollar but they assume"
08:17;08:21;"that you're gonna go in there and get some SunChips. Yeah, why do they sell SunChips"
08:21;08:26;"as such like a Subway thing? Maybe the cookies. Right. Maybe an iced tea or even"
08:26;08:31;"maybe just you come in enough for a $5 footlong, another day of the week you"
08:31;08:37;"might come in and get that $7.29 meatball parm. Yeah, you're burned out on the $5"
08:37;08:41;"footlong. So there's a lot of reasons why companies will occasionally take an L."
08:41;08:45;"And so I think what Amanda's suggesting is that maybe the $5 footlong is a"
08:45;08:52;"money-losing proposition for Subway that gets people in the door. And she might be"
08:52;08:57;"right about that. But either way. I doubt it, but I like where she's at. Maybe"
08:57;09:03;"they're like breaking even. Yeah. I'm sure their profit margin is slim on the $5 footlong."
10:28;10:31;"We also got another email that was pretty in-depth. This one is from Alexandra Gomez."
10:31;10:37;"She wrote, ""Hi. According to 5am EDT calculations..."" What does that mean?"
10:37;10:42;"Oh, EDT. I guess she's Canadian. So she's saying it would run her about $5.18"
10:42;10:49;"in Canadian dollars or $4.17 US per footlong sub sandwich."
10:49;10:53;"Okay, so this is her actually breaking down what she would have to buy. So she's"
10:53;10:58;"saying that if she was making her home footlongs, the best she could do is $4.17."
10:58;11:04;"Not that significant. You're only saving 83 cents. And then she breaks it down."
11:04;11:08;"I don't know if we have to go into all the detail. But basically she said, ""This is an extremely"
11:08;11:11;"basic sandwich, but I have no interest in browsing the ingredients of $5 footlongs."""
11:11;11:17;"Fair enough. She's thrown in cheese, lettuce, turkey, and she went with homemade bread because"
11:17;11:21;"it's cheap to make with long lasting ingredients you can buy in bulk. See, this is where I depart"
11:21;11:28;"with her. She says, ""I found that you can make 48 footlong bread rolls for $39 Canadian and still"
11:28;11:32;"have a bunch of leftover olive oil, salt, and sugar."" So she's saying you could make your own"
11:32;11:38;"footlong rolls for $1.23. So then she really breaks it down. She's getting into the price of yeast,"
11:38;11:44;"salt, sugar. And so she says, ""On a superficial mathematical level,"
11:44;11:49;"PS, I failed freshman algebra in high school."" Okay, full disclosure. But that could be for a"
11:49;11:54;"lot of reasons. You don't always fail a class because you don't have the mind for it. Maybe"
11:54;12:00;"the teacher was a jerk. Maybe she's just practicing bass too much. Just too passionate"
12:00;12:05;"about learning how to play the bass. Didn't do her homework. She really got into the Grateful"
12:05;12:11;"Dead that semester. Those Phil Lesh runs. Was watching Phil Lesh tutorials all night."
12:21;12:25;"So anyway, she's saying on a superficial mathematical level, it can be cheaper to make"
12:25;12:30;"your footlong sub every day. Thinking from the perspective of who this strategy would appeal to,"
12:30;12:35;"people experiencing poverty, it's still easier to go with the subway option when you factor in time,"
12:35;12:40;"especially when baking bread, accessibility to big box stores without a car, accessibility to"
12:40;12:45;"fresh produce, having clean running water and oven/heat. And of course, the sheer implausibility"
12:45;12:51;"of preparing and eating a whole footlong sandwich every day. So according to Alexandra,"
12:51;12:55;"you could save 83 cents. You could save 83 cents, but that also means slaving away,"
12:55;13:01;"making your own footlong baking bread. Brutal. So if we're really talking about it,"
13:01;13:06;"sounds like you might as well go to subway. This is just a weird ad for subway we're doing."
13:06;13:10;"I mean, well, what? And I'm just kind of curious about what else can you make your family for"
13:10;13:28;"lunch that's healthy, where you're still saving money. I don't know."
13:34;13:44;"Do you give them any time? Do you ever bully your conscience and detach from your mind?"
13:44;13:51;"Well, do you ever need the needy? Do they ever tug on your heart?"
13:51;14:02;"Or do you determine that person in question is simply worlds apart?"
14:16;14:21;"Do you ever wish to the wishful? Do you ever get what you need?"
14:23;14:33;"Do you detach from necessity and apply the act of greed? Well, do you ever dream with the dreamers?"
14:33;14:44;"Do you ever weaken the weak? Do you overuse the technique of not thinking before you speak?"
15:34;15:39;"All right, Jake, let's say you had two kids at home. Okay. Tomorrow, you're making lunch."
15:39;15:43;"Pack lunches to go? What if it's at home? Well, then you have more options. Because you could"
15:43;15:47;"make something. You make some like mac and cheese with the kid, and then you and your wife split a"
15:47;15:56;"salad. You know what I'm saying? Pack lunches, different story. Kid, I'm gonna do PB&J with"
15:56;16:04;"like a little Ziploc bag of like goldfish. All that **** played out, man. Is it? Do you think"
16:04;16:09;"of goldfish as a child's food? No. When was the last time that you were at the supermarket and"
16:09;16:13;"you just- Oh, no, I've never bought it at the supermarket. Get some goldfish. They'll be good"
16:13;16:17;"for snacking. If I'm at like a party and there's like a snack table or derv table, I'll get the"
16:17;16:22;"goldfish. How often are you at a party where there's goldfish on the snack table? Probably"
16:22;16:28;"like twice a year. Really? Yeah. What kind of party? Like an art event with a bunch of hipster"
16:28;16:34;"painters? It could be that, but it would be very sincere usage of goldfish. Really? I feel like"
16:34;16:38;"I've seen it. I think we have a different understanding of goldfish. I don't see goldfish"
16:38;16:43;"as like- Which is funnier if you're rolling up to an adult party and they have on the snack table,"
16:43;16:48;"goldfish or Chex Mix? Or to you, those are both totally normal things to- I think that's a wash,"
16:48;16:52;"dude. I think those are both totally normal things to have at an adult party. I've been to like,"
16:52;16:57;"maybe not art stuff, but like just going to like someone's like Christmas party. I went to like"
16:57;17:02;"two Christmas parties last month and- Somebody hosting in their home? Yeah, someone at their"
17:02;17:08;"house. Not an office? Just a nice, mellow neighborhood house party. A graphic designer"
17:08;17:16;"in Echo Park. Yep. Come through. Yep. There's like some pita and hummus. There's a little bowl of"
17:16;17:23;"goldfish. Goldfish? Really? Yes. No. Why? You're tripping, man. Why am I tripping?"
17:23;17:28;"Why are you tripping somewhere in goldfish? Okay, if there was a bag or like a bowl of Doritos,"
17:28;17:32;"would that trip you out? Less so, actually. I'm going to go goldfish before Doritos,"
17:32;17:37;"because Doritos are gnarly. Your hands get all nasty. Let's say that you have some friends."
17:37;17:42;"They're a couple. One of them's a social worker. One of them's a graphic designer."
17:43;17:51;"Cool fantasy. Tasteful vinyl collection. Oh, yeah. They're having a party. The beer is like"
17:51;17:57;"a tiny bit bougie. And then there's like, yeah, some carrots and hummus. And then just like a big"
17:57;18:03;"bowl of nacho cheese Doritos. Are you going to even think twice about that? I would do both."
18:03;18:10;"I love a carrot and hummus. My question is, every generation, the kind of like middle class"
18:11;18:18;"and upper middle class bougie people have kind of like their go to party snack foods. Yeah. And"
18:18;18:25;"to me, goldfish read more like a kid's party because it's marketed towards children. I think"
18:25;18:30;"goldfish are a classier move for adults than nacho cheese Doritos because it's low stakes."
18:30;18:38;"You just take a handful of goldfish. What about tostitos and salsa? That's great. That's a lateral"
18:38;18:43;"move from goldfish. No, it's not. We're on different wavelengths. I'm not having a real"
18:43;18:48;"quality communication breakdown here on Time Crisis. I'm just saying when I'm visualizing"
18:48;18:58;"this fantasy of these two, like solidly middle class. Yeah, I get it. OK. And they're throwing"
18:58;19:04;"their little shindig. Yeah. At their abode. And I'm seeing the spread. Yeah. I'm seeing"
19:06;19:12;"carrots and hummus. I'm seeing chips and salsa. Yeah. Guac if they're feeling generous. Yep."
19:12;19:18;"Summertime, make guac. Maybe some cheese. Maybe. Yeah, like a brie. I'm not seeing goldfish. Maybe"
19:18;19:23;"a salmon crostini. Well, yeah, if they're really, they're really going. They're really trying to"
19:23;19:26;"impress. I just point something out that might. Well, do they have goldfish in Canada? You familiar"
19:26;19:32;"with this? They do. OK. They're disgusting. Oh, really? They're gross, right? No. You actually"
19:32;19:38;"like them? Yeah. I'm in the goldfish. They taste processed. Well, I think goldfish is like the"
19:38;19:42;"white dress of foods. It turns out our whole society has been seeing it very differently."
19:42;19:48;"There's no consensus on goldfish. So you think of goldfish as like some disgusting trash? I mean,"
19:48;19:52;"that's very extreme, but I just I would avoid them. All I wanted to point out was that I was"
19:52;19:56;"like on the Wikipedia page of goldfish while you guys were speaking. And I've noticed that there"
19:56;20:02;"are like dozens of different varieties of goldfish. And I would posit that there are more"
20:02;20:07;"elevated types of goldfish for different occasions. There are some of them than your standard cheddar."
20:07;20:10;"That's what I'm saying. Like there's a Parmesan goldfish that seems like it would be more"
20:10;20:16;"bougie than, let's say, the cupcake flavored. No, no, no. Cupcake. You just take this French toast."
20:16;20:22;"There's a sweet goldfish. This sounds disgusting. Blasted atomic barbecue. There's fudge brownie."
20:22;20:26;"So they're trying to keep this sweet flavored goldfish. I'm saying they're trying to keep"
20:26;20:30;"up with Doritos. There's a different kind of goldfish for every kind of occasion. Cupcake."
20:30;20:36;"Wait, what was the atomic one? That's blasted atomic barbecue goldfish."
20:36;20:43;"Jake said that's sad. Whole grain. Jake said the party goldfish. Good call, Mark."
20:43;20:50;"Are these atomic blasts? What was blasted? Atomic blasted fajita blasted blasted atomic barbecue."
23:11;23:18;"Jake, if I threw a party. If you're throwing a party. I think our listeners are probably really"
23:18;23:23;"enjoying. I've been to your place, but I've never like. I was just throwing a party, dude. We're"
23:23;23:28;"going. You've been to my abode. I'm not much of a party thrower. Throw a party, dude. Throwing"
23:28;23:32;"parties is kind of stressful, but yeah, okay. But let's say I did throw a party. Yeah. Kind of low"
23:32;23:36;"key shindig at my abode. Hey Jake, I'm having a few people over to watch the SAG awards."
23:36;23:45;"I love it. I invite everybody, come through. I got some nice 10 to $20 wines, sixer of"
23:45;23:54;"Pacifico, a sixer. And then on the counter top, I've got two things of hummus and then just a"
23:54;24:02;"bowl of goldfish. I'm loving it. No, no carrots, no tortilla chips. It's just hummus and goldfish."
24:02;24:08;"Well, that's weird. Are you, are you, no, but there's no instructions. I'm busy. Hobnobbing"
24:08;24:15;"with the guests commentating on the SAG awards. Are you going to note that on the drive home?"
24:15;24:20;"With your wife? Are you going to be like, did you notice the goldfish hummus thing?"
24:20;24:23;"No, I'm not going to note that. You wouldn't even think about it. I would register it. I'd"
24:23;24:30;"probably be like, dude, I'd probably just call you out straight up. I love this idea. What's"
24:30;24:35;"the idea here? Is it, do I dip the tiny little goldfish in the hummus? Is that your plan here?"
24:35;24:39;"You know how sometimes there are these memes or you wouldn't even call them memes. They're like"
24:39;24:44;"pranks that become memes where it's like, somebody will be like, Hey everybody. Sometimes they're"
24:44;24:49;"very mean spirited. Be like, Hey everybody text your boyfriend or girlfriend or your significant"
24:49;24:55;"other this. Hey, is it cool if I have side chick, like something dumb and then post their reaction"
24:55;25:03;"or like text your mom or dad, pretend that, Hey, I'll, I'll buy an ounce for 125 bucks."
25:03;25:06;"And then write, oops, that wasn't for you and see how, you know, like little pranks like that."
25:06;25:12;"I've got a time crisis version. It's not as easy. I'm saying to anybody who's listening,"
25:12;25:16;"maybe you're in college, maybe you're a graphic designer, social worker. It doesn't matter what"
25:16;25:20;"you do. What it doesn't matter your income bracket. As long as you can afford to have people"
25:20;25:26;"over for the small shindig throw a party, provide the alcohol or make it BYOB. It doesn't matter,"
25:26;25:33;"but just make it on the snacks tray or counter, wherever you're posting the snacks, only provide"
25:33;25:40;"hummus and goldfish and goldfish. And then just tell us how people react to people say anything"
25:40;25:44;"or to people just grab the goldfish, start dipping them in the hummus, kind of get it all over their"
25:44;25:49;"fingers and just like lick their fingers. Are people calling it out? Like Jake said, he would"
25:49;25:54;"RP being like, Hey, uh, you got any like anything else to kind of PETA carrots or people just,"
25:54;25:59;"they go with the flow and they're just like, all right. So all the TC heads run that experiment"
25:59;26:05;"next weekend. Oh yeah. Wait, when's the super bowl February 4th. Okay. Even better. We got"
26:05;26:10;"the super bowl coming up February 4th. The time crisis super bowl challenge is you invite people"
26:10;26:16;"to your abode. You could even have other snacks or like order some pizzas. There could be pizza,"
26:16;26:20;"whatever. What's important is that there's nothing to dip in the hummus other than the goldfish."
26:20;26:25;"Right. And you really make a nice presentation. The goldfish go in a big ball right next to the"
26:25;26:31;"hummus, right next to the hummus. And then tell us what happens. The goldfish have to be the only"
26:32;26:37;"snackies kind of carb food. You could have pizza, you can have wings, whatever. Only"
26:37;26:43;"no chip delivery system for the hummus. And I guess if you really want up there and do,"
26:43;26:48;"you could have a big bowl of goldfish and then hummus, guac and salsa."
26:48;26:54;"Then you get called out. Okay. Maybe that's too much. Yeah. No, just the, I like this,"
26:54;27:00;"the hummus and the goldfish, one large hummus and the goldfish. That's the time crisis"
27:00;27:10;"Superbowl challenge."
27:16;27:18;"laid out for the party."
27:18;27:30;"There were candy and spices and try colored pastas. The meat was drunk from succulent juices"
27:32;27:42;"served on platters of the purest gold."
28:04;28:08;"It's almost like a followup to clap that wonderful tonight."
28:22;28:26;"the wife and I thank you very much."
28:26;28:30;"Most mild narrative."
28:30;28:39;"Time crisis."
28:39;28:53;"My wife was competing in a game of chance."
28:55;29:01;"The party raged and the guests were screaming."
29:01;29:04;"I could have danced all night."
29:04;29:15;"We had the best time at your party. The wife and I thank you very much."
29:18;29:26;"We had the best time at your party. The wife and I thank you very much."
29:26;29:28;"That was wean with your party."
29:28;29:34;"Very topical song. Don't forget to let us know how the time crisis Superbowl challenge goes."
29:34;29:41;"Here's another email we got, or realistically, I should say Jake, you got this one's comes from"
29:41;29:47;"James McKinney. Hello, Jake and Ezra. Thank you for taking the time to read this email."
29:47;29:51;"I really look forward to every other Sunday of the month. Thanks to you three. Shout out Seinfeld."
29:51;29:57;"Jake is I know you are a big fan of nineties rock bands such as pavement and Fugazi and Ezra."
29:57;30:01;"I know you have a special place in your heart for reggae music. I was hoping I could gain"
30:01;30:05;"your guys opinion on one of the most influential bands of the nineties. Sublime."
30:06;30:12;"Sublime."
30:12;30:20;"So, Jake, as soon as you hear Sublime, like what's your gut?"
30:20;30:28;"Respect, but not in. Okay, well, let's go a little deeper. Not only is time crisis not mentioned"
30:28;30:35;"Sublime in the life of the show, we get a fact check on that. It seems likely, but many of the"
30:35;30:39;"major music blogs have not written about Sublime along with lack of coverage for most modern reggae"
30:39;30:45;"bands. Now I can see how a lot of modern reggae bands may lack originality, but it is undeniable"
30:45;30:51;"that Sublime had a huge impact on not only reggae music, but nineties music as a whole with two"
30:51;30:55;"platinum albums and multiple hit singles that still get radio play. Correct me if I'm wrong,"
30:55;31:00;"but Sublime was the first group to blend influences of punk, reggae, psychedelic rock and hip hop"
31:00;31:04;"completely pushing the genre forward. I don't know. People might debate that."
31:04;31:08;"What was the combination? Punk, reggae, psychedelic rock and hip hop."
31:08;31:12;"I guess you could say that. Bad Brains or? I mean, yeah, well, they met,"
31:12;31:18;"yeah, hip hop. I don't know. Clash. But is there a hip hop and Sublime? Oh yeah. I'm not. Okay. I"
31:18;31:23;"don't know the catalog that well. They were using hip hop beats. He was rapping his ass off. Okay."
31:23;31:27;"I think they were the first to blend it in quite that way. I mean, original band. Let's also not"
31:27;31:32;"forget their amazing cover of the dead Scarlet Begonias, which may arguably be more popular than"
31:32;31:36;"the dead, at least for the younger audience. Have you heard that one, Jake? Not in a long time. You"
31:36;31:41;"want to bring it up? Sure. See, and this, I mean, he's right about this. I'd like to hear something"
31:41;31:46;"by them also. That's not, um, what's their big song, Santa Rio or whatever. I know that's a good"
31:46;31:51;"two big songs are Santa Ri and what I got, what I got kind of bites. This is what their cover of"
31:51;31:58;"the grateful that's right. Scarlet Begonia sounds like funky drummer loop. That's hip hop, right?"
31:58;32:04;"This is their first album. That was an album track."
32:16;32:24;"This is pretty rough. I like it though. It's got, it's got like an interesting energy."
32:24;32:38;"This is truly a blend of hip hop, reggae and the grateful dead."
32:43;32:50;"And then later you like starts rapping."
32:50;33:03;"So they really put their own spin on it. I wonder if Jerry heard it."
33:03;33:07;"You know what? I bet he did. Well, this came out in 92, right?"
33:07;33:11;"Need a couple of years there. They had a couple of years of crossover."
33:11;33:17;"I mean, sublime was not a very big bend in 92. Oh, it's kind of 94, 95. They started gaining"
33:17;33:20;"momentum. And then, you know, the crazy thing is that the big album came out"
33:20;33:26;"only a few weeks after the singer Bradley died. That is crazy. This guy got married. He had a"
33:26;33:32;"kid with his girlfriend. They got married. He died a week later. And then the album came out like a"
33:32;33:38;"few weeks after that. How did he die? Heroin overdose. Yeah. Rough. So that was like 96 or"
33:38;33:43;"something. Yeah. Yeah. I just missed the boat on sublime. I just, uh, you know, it's funny. They"
33:43;33:48;"seem like a real regional band in a way too. Cause like, I remember in college friends of mine that"
33:48;33:54;"were from Southern California were like sublime heads. Yeah. Like represent style. Well, what's"
33:54;33:58;"your vibe? They're kind of regional in a way. Well, let me read the rest of the email before I"
33:58;34:03;"weigh in. I mean, definitely some like chili peppers vibes, right? Yeah. They're even more"
34:03;34:08;"kind of fun than chili peppers. They're like mixing in more samples and getting weird with"
34:08;34:13;"the production. Um, James says, yes, Bradley had some derogatory song subjects. Yes. The band was"
34:13;34:17;"short lived due to the tragic and sudden loss of Bradley. And yes, not all the songs on 40"
34:17;34:22;"ounce to freedom are original, but I do think that you should not dismiss the band for being"
34:22;34:28;"recognized as a monumental nineties band along with Nirvana, red hot chili peppers, pearl jam,"
34:28;34:33;"et cetera. I may have only been a newborn when their self-titled album came out. And I may have"
34:33;34:37;"been jamming smoke to joints before I knew what a joint was, but I just feel like Bradley's legacy"
34:37;34:42;"and artistic value has not been carried on and recognized as it should be. The passion is right"
34:42;34:46;"there in the music. Do you guys at time crisis feel the same way or am I undervaluing the love"
34:46;34:52;"this band has received over the years? Much love from Wilmington, Delaware, James. I think he is"
34:52;34:57;"undervaluing the love that they've received. I think they're like pretty widely loved band."
34:57;35:02;"They're not exactly like an underrated band, but you know, if you compare him to Kurt Cobain,"
35:02;35:09;"two guys who died too young in the nineties and who were hugely influential Nirvana gets more,"
35:09;35:14;"more critical respect. Yeah, but they were a much bigger band. Sublime got massive after the dude"
35:14;35:19;"died. Nirvana was massive while Kurt was alive. Sublime didn't have as nearly as many like"
35:19;35:24;"memorable singles. Maybe not. I mean, they had like two big singles, right? They had two massive"
35:24;35:30;"singles and they had a bunch of like decent ones beneath that. Their album cuts are like,"
35:30;35:35;"this is track one on the big album called Garden Grove, Garden Grove, California. It's about going"
35:35;35:40;"to Garden Grove, California. Oh dude. Do you remember? I think we played a show in Garden"
35:40;35:56;"Grove. Yeah. I remember that. His Dalmatian Lou dog figured very heavily into the mythology of"
35:56;36:16;"the group. I'm kind of in on this actually. It sounds pretty good. Their second album was like"
36:16;36:23;"a real weirdo album in between. It's called Robin the Hood. It's like a lot of like a homeless guy"
36:23;36:28;"talking a lot of like dubby weird experimental stuff. Like this is what track one sounds like"
36:28;36:34;"on the second Sublime album. '94. Real kind of lo-fi. Do you know these records, Ezra? Yeah,"
36:34;36:40;"I know them pretty well. Oh yeah, this has like a real... It's a minute long. It's called"
36:40;36:56;"Waiting for Bud. I'm feeling this. Some SoCal dudes, love reggae, hip hop. This is just like"
36:56;37:01;"them in a basement. Yeah, it's tight. Dude, I gotta check this out. Yeah, you gotta go deeper"
37:01;37:07;"on Sublime. Who was the emailer, James? Yeah, James. James has, I think, piqued my interest."
37:07;37:11;"There's some good sh*t in there. My feeling about Sublime is like when I first really got to know"
37:11;37:16;"Sublime was, you know, when that album was blowing up. I was probably 12. Okay. And so he'd already"
37:16;37:21;"died and that album started getting big and I really liked Santeria. Right, great song. Yeah,"
37:21;37:27;"great song. I vaguely remember doing like, we had to do a school project. We were doing like a"
37:27;37:33;"semester learning about the civil rights movement and you had to like create a work of art to talk"
37:33;37:38;"about something that we'd learned, you know, like classic random. And I kind of remember me and one"
37:38;37:45;"of my classmates, a girl named Joy, wrote a version of Santeria that was about Martin Luther King."
37:45;37:52;"Wow. Did you sing it? Yeah, I probably did like a really awkward version of the chords. Like,"
37:52;37:57;"I think the chorus of ours was like, ""What I really want to know, why can't we live in peace?"""
37:57;38:06;"It was something like that. But there's probably a cassette somewhere."
40:19;40:26;"At that age, I was already like really interested in reggae and ska, and I was already like a bit"
40:26;40:31;"of a music nerd. So- Wow, you were cool. Depends how you define cool. There's this whole wave of"
40:31;40:36;"ska bands around then called third wave ska. Sure. So already there's a part of me, and then I had"
40:36;40:41;"like my dad's old records, and I was listening to the Specials and Madness and that wave of ska."
40:41;40:45;"So I- That's pretty cool for a 12 year old, dude. Oh yeah, but I was- I was doing like Zeppelin,"
40:45;40:51;"and that's about it. I was very interested in punk and ska when I was 12. So Sublime,"
40:51;40:56;"I thought the singles were great, and I love Santeria, obviously enough to do a cover of it."
40:56;40:59;"But I couldn't bring myself to buy the CD at that age, because I was already trying to"
40:59;41:03;"differentiate myself by being like, that's what all the kids at school are listening to. So I"
41:03;41:09;"respect it, but I'm more interested in a slightly lesser known- I want to listen to Operation Ivy."
41:09;41:12;"You'd rather spend your 1895- Yeah."
41:12;41:15;"On Op Ivy. On Op Ivy, exactly. But that said, I always"
41:15;41:20;"respected Sublime, and then as I got older, I dug deeper into the records. And I would say that"
41:20;41:24;"they're an influence on Vampire Weekend. I always said, because Sublime was considered part of third"
41:24;41:28;"wave ska. Pitchfork headline, Ezra Koenig says Sublime is influenced on- Yeah, please don't"
41:28;41:33;"write- if any journalists are listening, don't write about this. This is strictly for the TC"
41:33;41:35;"heads. Raw on Soulja. This is just for the love."
41:35;41:43;"This is just for the love. But I mean, obviously Vampire Weekend's always had a ska influence."
41:43;41:45;"Right, I can see this now. I mean, to me, Holiday-"
41:45;41:48;"Holiday! Is a straight up ska punk song."
41:48;41:48;"Sure."
41:48;41:56;"You know, and so the first album, there's definitely a Jamaican influence, so that"
41:56;42:02;"includes ska on certain songs. But you know, none of the singles exactly. But I remember when we"
42:02;42:06;"were talking about what the next album should sound like, and what my vision for the second"
42:06;42:11;"album, Contra, was. And I remember before we even started working on it, I kind of laid out my pitch"
42:11;42:16;"to the rest of the guys. And I was like, Contra's like our SoCal album."
42:16;42:17;"I remember this."
42:17;42:19;"Maybe we even talked about it. Oh yeah, because I interviewed you."
42:19;42:20;"You were making a-"
42:20;42:21;"A documentary."
42:21;42:25;"Yeah, which will be released in another 25 years."
42:25;42:26;"Yeah, still editing it."
42:26;42:28;"And you interviewed the guy from Korn?"
42:28;42:32;"Yeah, that was the whole thing. We were like meeting all these SoCal music legends."
42:32;42:35;"And then you interviewed me as like a California artist."
42:35;42:38;"That's right. I hadn't spent enough time in California, so I was still so"
42:38;42:40;"fascinated by the whole state."
42:40;42:40;"Right."
42:40;42:46;"And so I kind of saw Contra as being, even though some songs are very much take place in New York,"
42:46;42:52;"but my guiding principle was always like, Contra is kind of like our SoCal album, you know,"
42:52;42:59;"adjacent to Mexico, California ska punk. And, you know, and like, to me, like Cousins and"
42:59;43:03;"Holiday, those are kind of, I don't know, a little bit influenced by like-"
43:03;43:05;"Yeah, I mean, it makes sense now."
43:05;43:06;"The Men and Men or something."
43:06;43:11;"I've never thought about Sublime in relation to VW, but-"
43:11;43:15;"And I even remember at that time, like Sublime was like pretty unfashionable. I just remember"
43:15;43:18;"having this conversation, like the airport, we were just like talking around, hanging out,"
43:18;43:23;"talking s***. And so, you know, after your first album, you still have such a one-dimensional"
43:23;43:27;"impression because people have heard one record at that time, people thought of us a very specific"
43:27;43:32;"way, like the Collegiate, whatever. And I just kind of remember thinking, you know what would"
43:32;43:37;"be tight? Right now, Vampire Weekend's got the kind of like, we're existing this kind of indie"
43:37;43:41;"sphere. On the next album, we should like, you know, expand our universe. And what would be"
43:41;43:45;"tight is if people who like Sublime got into Vampire Weekend. I remember like saying that."
43:45;43:48;"And actually, dude, it comes full circle because now you're all about the dead."
43:48;43:50;"Doing an 8-minute Cape Cod."
43:50;43:58;"Sublime covered the dead. So now you're going full Sublime meets the dead."
43:58;43:58;"Exactly."
43:58;44:01;"It doesn't get more unfashionable. Although I guess the dead are kind of fashionable now."
44:01;44:06;"And I guess maybe even Sublime's kind of fashionable. But I think I always saw Vampire"
44:06;44:12;"Weekend's lineage. Well, it's, it depends. Because Vampire Weekend has different modes,"
44:12;44:16;"but I always thought of us as being like, I always liked the idea that we're at least a"
44:16;44:20;"little bit in the mode of like the feel good bands. You know what I mean? Even though we"
44:20;44:26;"definitely have some feel bad songs, but one of our modes is like feel good. Some people don't"
44:26;44:31;"do feel good. A lot of people, because feel good and cool often don't intersect."
44:31;44:33;"Yeah. Nirvana wasn't doing a lot of feel good."
44:33;44:37;"I think you suggested to me once that Vampire Weekend should cover Scarlet Begonias next time"
44:37;44:38;"we go on tour."
44:38;44:39;"I remember that. Yeah."
44:39;44:44;"But it would be kind of hilarious to do. We could cover Scarlet Begonias, but do it like"
44:44;44:50;"Sublime style. In fact, you want to hear what it sounded like when Sublime played that live?"
44:50;44:50;"I do."
44:50;44:51;"In '95?"
44:51;44:51;"I really do."
44:51;44:53;"Keep in mind, there's only three guys. So they're-"
44:53;44:55;"Oh really? I didn't know it was a trio."
44:55;44:55;"Yeah, it's a trio."
44:55;45:00;"Oh, wow. I like people being like, yeah, Vampire Weekend's like really influenced by Paul Simon."
45:00;45:02;"And you're like, nah, dude, Sublime and the dead."
45:02;45:06;"Yeah. Our Sublime and dead influences are often mistaken for Paul Simon,"
45:06;45:08;"but don't get it twisted."
45:08;45:08;"Yeah, I'm not a fan."
45:08;45:13;"Not a fan. This is what they sound like doing it live in '95."
45:13;45:18;"Love that '90s snare drum."
45:18;45:29;"You hear him like switching between hitting the pedal to-"
45:29;45:30;"So just one guitarist?"
45:30;45:34;"Wait, is Bradley playing guitar?"
45:34;45:34;"Yeah, I think so."
45:34;45:38;"So it's just bass, guitar, and drums? It's just Nirvana style."
45:38;45:40;"Yeah, unless they had an extra person on stage. I don't think they did."
45:40;45:47;"Is he solo?"
45:47;45:48;"I think he does a little."
45:48;45:58;"That's pretty rough."
45:58;46:00;"But I mean, this would be hard to do."
46:00;46:01;"Yeah."
46:01;46:02;"Hitting the end."
46:02;46:15;"Three-piece solos."
46:15;46:16;"That'd be pretty rough."
46:42;46:45;"Nah, he didn't- he did the riff."
46:57;47:02;"It's always been a goal of mine that if Vampiric could win over Sublime fans,"
47:02;47:05;"if there's anybody out there who like seriously likes Vampiric and seriously likes Sublime,"
47:05;47:06;"that makes me feel good."
47:06;47:07;"Sounds like James, dude."
47:07;47:10;"Maybe James is a mutual fan, or maybe he's just a TC fan."
47:10;47:11;"But-"
47:12;47:13;"I hate Vampire Weekend, but-"
47:13;47:14;"I wonder if there is-"
47:14;47:15;"Radio show is pretty fun."
47:15;47:19;"There is anybody who's like, ""Nah, I don't like Vampire Weekend."""
47:19;47:19;"Strictly Tom Crisis."
47:19;47:24;"We got that email the other day from that story of those kids in Philly going to that frat party,"
47:24;47:28;"and they were like kind of wary of going to this frat party."
47:28;47:31;"And then the frat dude was like, ""Somehow Vampire Weekend came up or something."""
47:31;47:34;"Oh, they said that they went to his room to like do drugs,"
47:34;47:35;"and like Vampire Weekend started playing."
47:35;47:38;"Yeah, and the guy was like, ""Man, his show is tight."""
47:38;47:40;"You guys listen to Tom Crisis?"
47:40;47:40;"Yeah."
47:41;47:42;"Shout out to whoever wrote us that email."
47:42;47:43;"That was a good one."
47:43;47:44;"That was fun."

50:33;50:35;"on the phone, who's a writer, director, actor,"
50:35;50:37;"and a good buddy of yours, Jake."
50:37;50:37;"- Oh yeah."
50:37;50:39;"- So you say you're about to go to Sundance."
50:39;50:41;"- Yeah. - Why is that?"
50:41;50:43;"- Well, my wife Hannah directed a film"
50:43;50:47;"that she co-wrote with our guest Carson Mel"
50:47;50:48;"called ""The Long Dumb Road"""
50:48;50:50;"and it's playing at Sundance."
50:50;50:52;"And so-- - Great film."
50:52;50:53;"- She's already out there."
50:53;50:55;"- So you said Carson is also the guy who married you."
50:55;50:56;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
50:56;50:57;"Okay, so Carson co-wrote the movie"
50:57;50:59;"and then we got married in September"
50:59;51:02;"and he performed the ceremony, which was great."
51:02;51:03;"- And Carson now has his own show,"
51:03;51:06;"a cartoon called ""Tarantula"" on TBS."
51:06;51:09;"- He's gonna call in to promote this show that he wrote"
51:09;51:12;"and designed all the characters and whatnot."
51:12;51:14;"- You know, I've watched the vast majority of it."
51:14;51:15;"- That's tight."
51:15;51:15;"- It's great. - Yeah."
51:15;51:17;"- It all kind of takes place--"
51:17;51:18;"- In a bar. - In a bar"
51:18;51:20;"and apartment complex"
51:20;51:25;"in kind of like brutal, sun-baked weirdo--"
51:25;51:26;"- Like Arizona."
51:26;51:28;"- Oh, it's not California? - Oh no, you know what it is?"
51:28;51:30;"I thought it was Arizona 'cause Carson's from Arizona."
51:30;51:31;"- Yeah. - I feel like he's drawing"
51:31;51:34;"on Arizona a lot, but it is set in California."
51:34;51:36;"- It's got a touch of like Big Lebowski,"
51:36;51:40;"a touch of just kind of like King of the Hill weirdo."
51:40;51:41;"So yeah, it's great."
51:41;51:43;"- Just some kind of like drunk wisdom."
51:43;51:45;"- Yeah, weird people hanging out in bars"
51:45;51:46;"going on adventures."
51:46;51:48;"All right, so let's get Carson on the phone."
51:48;51:51;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
51:51;51:54;"(phone ringing)"
51:54;51:55;"- Hello, Carson?"
51:55;51:56;"- Hello."
51:56;51:57;"- Hey, what's up, man?"
51:57;51:58;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
51:58;52:00;"What's up, dude? - Thank you very much."
52:00;52:01;"How's it going?"
52:01;52:02;"- Great."
52:02;52:04;"Well, before we talk to you about tarantula"
52:04;52:07;"and Long Dumb Road, just real quick,"
52:07;52:08;"do you eat goldfish?"
52:08;52:09;"- The cracker?"
52:09;52:10;"- Yeah."
52:10;52:11;"- Well, I'm gluten-free."
52:11;52:14;"I don't eat gluten, but if I did, I would."
52:14;52:15;"- Do you think it's weird if you went over"
52:15;52:17;"to a childless adult couple's house"
52:17;52:20;"and they had goldfish out as just like a party snack?"
52:20;52:23;"Would you note that and be like, ""That's kind of weird""?"
52:23;52:24;"- No."
52:24;52:26;"- You would think that's as normal as tortilla chips?"
52:26;52:30;"- Well, no, it's not as normal as tortilla chips,"
52:30;52:35;"but I think it's a fully acceptable adult snack."
52:35;52:37;"I know you want 'em more as a kid,"
52:37;52:39;"but my parents wouldn't buy 'em for me."
52:39;52:40;"- Really?"
52:40;52:42;"- Yeah, maybe the people who had the snack"
52:42;52:46;"are trying to fulfill not getting them as a use, you know?"
52:46;52:49;"- We got in a real heated debate about this earlier,"
52:49;52:50;"and I'm on your side, buddy."
52:50;52:52;"- Wait, but Carson, straight up,"
52:52;52:53;"you go over to Jake and Hannah's house,"
52:53;52:55;"they're like, ""Carson, you wanna come over?"
52:55;52:57;"""We're watching the SAG Awards."""
52:57;53:01;"And they have some wine and then just a big bowl of goldfish."
53:01;53:02;"You wouldn't even comment on it."
53:02;53:03;"You'd be like, ""Nice."""
53:03;53:05;"- I think I would be more bothered by the SAG Awards."
53:05;53:08;"(laughing)"
53:08;53:09;"- All right, fair enough."
53:09;53:12;"- I don't know, that feels less like an adult activity."
53:12;53:14;"(laughing)"
53:14;53:15;"- That's a weird hypothetical."
53:15;53:17;"- Hey, Carson, what are you guys doing tonight?"
53:17;53:19;"Wanna come over and watch the SAG Awards?"
53:19;53:22;"- We're doing our famous goldfish SAG Awards night."
53:22;53:24;"- So, Carson, you got a new show, Tarantula."
53:24;53:26;"I was just telling Jake I love the show."
53:26;53:27;"- Oh, thanks a lot."
53:27;53:30;"- I took down almost the entire thing on a flight recently."
53:30;53:31;"- Oh, awesome."
53:31;53:32;"- Great cartoon."
53:32;53:34;"It's a little bit unclear exactly where it takes place."
53:34;53:37;"I love it 'cause it's kinda like a grown-up,"
53:37;53:39;"vibey cartoon taking place"
53:39;53:41;"in primarily a barn apartment complex."
53:41;53:43;"Do you think of it as taking place in LA?"
53:43;53:47;"- Well, the town is called Los Palacios, and it is LA."
53:47;53:48;"- Oh, I thought maybe that was like the hood."
53:48;53:50;"- No, that's the, well, yeah."
53:50;53:51;"I mean, in the same way that you've got"
53:51;53:53;"like Monrovia, Arcadia."
53:53;53:54;"- Right."
53:54;53:57;"- It's really based on those two towns."
53:57;53:59;"So I don't know if you go out east that far,"
53:59;54:01;"but that's what it's based on."
54:01;54:02;"- I haven't spent a lot of time there."
54:02;54:04;"I mean, I've gone to the racetrack in Arcadia."
54:04;54:05;"Have you chilled there?"
54:05;54:06;"- Yeah, quite a bit."
54:06;54:08;"Well, my friend owns a pizza restaurant out there"
54:08;54:13;"called Zello that's like some of the best pizza in LA."
54:13;54:15;"Like people drive out there for it."
54:15;54:15;"- Dude, we gotta go."
54:15;54:16;"- Yeah, it's great."
54:16;54:19;"And so I started hanging out there,"
54:19;54:20;"and then I made friends out there,"
54:20;54:23;"and I don't really go too much anymore,"
54:23;54:26;"except there's nice hiking with like ferns"
54:26;54:27;"and like more of a green vibe"
54:27;54:30;"than the desert kind of hiking in our neighborhoods,"
54:30;54:31;"you know?"
54:31;54:31;"- Yeah."
54:31;54:34;"- So that's why I go out there, but."
54:34;54:36;"- So what was the inspiration for Tarantula?"
54:36;54:38;"Like, do you know a lot of people like this?"
54:38;54:42;"Kind of like weirdo, daytime bar, storyteller,"
54:42;54:45;"kind of aging hippie types?"
54:45;54:46;"- You know, I don't know a ton of people like that."
54:46;54:49;"I mean, I know a lot of storyteller type people,"
54:49;54:52;"but I think a lot of it's just kind of fantasy."
54:52;54:55;"Like if I wasn't like unhealthily ambitious,"
54:55;54:57;"what would I be doing with my life?"
54:57;54:59;"I think I'd probably just be sitting around in a bar"
54:59;55:02;"and tattooing seems like a good way to be an artist,"
55:02;55:07;"and it's like, but without like any glory, you know?"
55:07;55:09;"- I think there's some real crossover in the sensibility"
55:09;55:11;"between Tarantula and the Long Dumb Road."
55:11;55:13;"A lot of like drunken wisdom."
55:13;55:16;"- Honestly, the character of Echo just popped into my head,"
55:16;55:18;"and it was really just talking in his voice"
55:18;55:20;"and making up little stories about him"
55:20;55:23;"was the real inspiration for all of it, you know?"
55:23;55:25;"- Let's tell people a little bit more about Long Dumb Road."
55:25;55:30;"So as we said, Carson, you co-wrote this with Hannah."
55:30;55:30;"- Yeah."
55:30;55:33;"- Who's also Jake's wife, and she directed it."
55:33;55:34;"So who's in it?"
55:34;55:36;"Jason Manzoukas, who's hilarious in it."
55:36;55:37;"- Yeah."
55:37;55:38;"- Who else?"
55:38;55:39;"- Tony Revolori."
55:39;55:41;"- A lot of people might know from Grand Budapest Hotel."
55:41;55:42;"- Right, he was the bellboy."
55:42;55:44;"- Teysa Farmiga."
55:44;55:47;"- Yep, Casey Wilson and Ron Livingston."
55:47;55:49;"- Mm, I also just got a question for you guys."
55:49;55:52;"So you guys are premiering the film at Sundance."
55:52;55:54;"- Yeah, you guys."
55:54;55:55;"- Well, you're--"
55:55;55:56;"- Yeah, my crew."
55:56;55:57;"- The crew."
55:57;55:59;"- It's premiering soon."
55:59;56:01;"- Is this because somebody's gonna buy it there,"
56:01;56:02;"or it's already bought?"
56:02;56:03;"- I think that's the idea."
56:03;56:05;"No, it is, yeah, someone's gonna buy it."
56:05;56:06;"- So you don't know when this'll be in like theaters"
56:06;56:08;"or on demand or anything?"
56:08;56:09;"- Don't know."
56:09;56:10;"- No, it's all crap shoot."
56:10;56:12;"You never know about any of that."
56:20;56:46;"♪ Running my mouth off at the storm ♪"
56:46;56:51;"♪ Yelling man, what the hell did you do that for ♪"
56:51;56:58;"♪ And I was watching the old man fish ♪"
56:58;57:02;"♪ And made out with a catch away ♪"
57:02;57:06;"♪ And I could hear a woman singing ♪"
57:06;57:09;"♪ And I could feel that piano play ♪"
57:09;57:10;"♪ And go like ♪"
57:10;57:12;"- You made a cartoon as well, didn't you?"
57:12;57:14;"- That's right, made Neo Yokio."
57:14;57:17;"- Made Neo Yokio, feels like a long time ago."
57:17;57:18;"- Oh yeah, I know, right?"
57:18;57:21;"Did you know when it was coming out?"
57:21;57:23;"- No, that's a funny thing, is that with Neo Yokio,"
57:23;57:25;"we had to sit on it kind of for a long time"
57:25;57:27;"because we ended up selling it to Netflix"
57:27;57:29;"from Fox where it originally was and blah, blah, blah,"
57:29;57:31;"but it wasn't like some real time thing"
57:31;57:34;"where episode one is done, airing on Sunday kind of vibe."
57:34;57:35;"- Yeah."
57:35;57:36;"- So how long have you been working on Tarantula?"
57:36;57:39;"- I did a web series of it in 2012"
57:39;57:44;"and sold it into the TV network systems in 2011."
57:44;57:46;"- 2013."
57:46;57:51;"- And then started writing in earnest and all that in 2016."
57:51;57:53;"So it was like a year and a half"
57:53;57:56;"from like Greenlight to On the Air."
57:56;57:58;"- But still a very long odyssey."
57:58;58:00;"- Oh my, yeah, super long."
58:00;58:02;"But it sounds like a similar thing happened with you"
58:02;58:06;"'cause you were originally, you made Neo Yokio for Fox."
58:06;58:09;"- Yeah, so it's obviously animation already takes"
58:09;58:11;"a long time as everybody knows, but yeah,"
58:11;58:14;"on top of that, just like not being exactly sure"
58:14;58:16;"when it's gonna come out and yeah, so it's funny,"
58:16;58:18;"like making a bunch of decisions and then on like"
58:18;58:21;"what I thought was like relevant or funny"
58:21;58:23;"and then it doesn't come out for two years."
58:23;58:23;"- Yeah."
58:23;58:24;"- That's crazy."
58:24;58:27;"- Was that just because ADHD went away?"
58:27;58:29;"- Yeah, and so it was kind of cool"
58:29;58:30;"that we got to do it on Netflix."
58:30;58:31;"Everybody could watch it all at once and stuff,"
58:31;58:33;"but it still just kind of took a long time."
58:33;58:36;"- I'm liking this TV shop talk for the audience."
58:36;58:37;"- Yeah, we talk a lot about music."
58:37;58:40;"We don't talk about the other arms of showbiz"
58:40;58:42;"quite as much on Time Crisis."
58:42;58:45;"I will say that music industry's got a lot of problems,"
58:45;58:47;"but it is better than TV."
58:47;58:48;"- Really, why?"
58:48;58:49;"(laughing)"
58:49;58:50;"- I'll tell you why."
58:50;58:51;"- Tell me."
58:51;58:53;"- Because, well at least what Carson and I are talking about,"
58:53;58:57;"making a cartoon, it's just so time consuming."
58:57;58:58;"- Takes forever."
58:58;59:00;"- Takes, you need so many green lights"
59:00;59:04;"that even at the highest reaches of the music industry,"
59:04;59:08;"the Ed Sheerans, the Cold Plays, Beyonce's,"
59:08;59:11;"even when you're that person, like at such a high level,"
59:11;59:14;"if you wanted to, you could still bang out a song"
59:14;59:16;"on an acoustic guitar, throw it up on SoundCloud"
59:16;59:17;"10 minutes later."
59:17;59:18;"- Yep."
59:18;59:19;"- You know what I mean?"
59:19;59:21;"It's just like, it's a faster, and I mean,"
59:21;59:24;"it's funny 'cause it takes me a long time to make albums,"
59:24;59:26;"so I can't really claim that I take a lot of advantage"
59:26;59:28;"of it, but I don't know, it's just kind of like"
59:28;59:31;"a faster industry where you don't have to deal"
59:31;59:33;"with quite as many people."
59:33;59:34;"- Right."
59:34;59:35;"- Well and also, it's good to hear you say that"
59:35;59:38;"'cause I always assumed it was easier to write a song"
59:38;59:40;"and record a song, which I do as a hobbyist,"
59:40;59:42;"but not in any kind of professional way,"
59:42;59:45;"than it is to make an episode of TV,"
59:45;59:49;"and just literally the sheer length of it,"
59:49;59:51;"you know, like a 20 minute song might be as hard to write"
59:51;59:55;"as like a episode of TV, but it's like,"
59:55;59:57;"just sitting with something that's 20 minutes"
59:57;01:00:00;"and nitpicking it over and over, it literally just eats up"
01:00:00;01:00:01;"way more time."
01:00:01;01:00:03;"- Right, well, and I would also make the point that,"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"I was having this conversation the other day"
01:00:05;01:00:08;"with a musician friend, like everything that we do,"
01:00:08;01:00:11;"you have a certain set of constraints"
01:00:11;01:00:12;"that you gotta deal with."
01:00:12;01:00:16;"So like, in music, if you're trying to make anything"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"remotely that falls under the giant umbrella"
01:00:18;01:00:22;"of popular music, pop music, you gotta kind of have"
01:00:22;01:00:25;"a chorus or you need some degree of repetition."
01:00:25;01:00:27;"Even if you don't have a chorus, you might have a verse"
01:00:27;01:00:27;"and then something, you know?"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"- Yeah."
01:00:28;01:00:30;"- Part of what makes a song catchy, which is part"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"of pop music, is that there's certain repetition."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"So that's a kind of easy constraint,"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"because if like we start writing a song right now,"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"got a good idea for a verse, second verse,"
01:00:38;01:00:39;"we already got the melody."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"- Yep."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"- Maybe we even just change a word."
01:00:41;01:00:43;"Whereas the constraint of making an episode of TV,"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"even if you're making some weirdo (beep)"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"and I think both of our shows are definitely weird,"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"one of the constraints is like people need to"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"not be confused about what happened,"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"need to be able to follow the plot."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"And that's actually a much more difficult constraint."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"You couldn't make a show and be like,"
01:00:57;01:01:00;"oh, the first half was funny, let's make the second half"
01:01:00;01:01:00;"more or less the same."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"Like it doesn't work like that."
01:01:01;01:01:04;"You just got a lot more questions to answer,"
01:01:04;01:01:06;"you gotta do a lot more to make it work."
01:01:06;01:01:09;"Whereas truly a total nut could write a catchy song."
01:01:09;01:01:10;"- Yeah."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"- Without having to sit down and be like,"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"wait, when does the story turn?"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"You know, all those things."
01:01:15;01:01:16;"- Well, the cool thing about music is it's like"
01:01:16;01:01:20;"the one popular art form that's inherently abstract."
01:01:20;01:01:23;"You're not trying to mimic nature at all."
01:01:23;01:01:26;"You're not trying to, you know, and stories maybe,"
01:01:26;01:01:27;"even if they don't mimic nature,"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"they're so ingrained in us now."
01:01:29;01:01:33;"Like you've gotta mimic the story structure."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"I resisted three act structure"
01:01:35;01:01:36;"and I probably still do in a lot of ways,"
01:01:36;01:01:39;"but eventually you just bow down to it"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"and you're like, okay, this is my God"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"and I gotta figure out how to do this"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"to make compelling work, you know?"
01:01:45;01:01:48;"- Right, deep down, even some of the most open-minded"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"like TV viewers, like very highbrow people,"
01:01:50;01:01:54;"the type who would never have goldfish at their abode,"
01:01:54;01:01:58;"even those people demand a pretty basic story structure."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"- Yeah."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"- Otherwise they'll be like, it didn't move right."
01:02:01;01:02:02;"I was confused."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"- Well, it's kind of freeing when you realize that."
01:02:04;01:02:07;"Like the plots in Tarantula,"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"I just call them ABC plots."
01:02:09;01:02:14;"Like character wants something, needs to get it,"
01:02:14;01:02:16;"challenges, they get it in maybe hopefully"
01:02:16;01:02:19;"a surprising way kind of thing, you know?"
01:02:19;01:02:20;"In the same way that you're like,"
01:02:20;01:02:23;"oh, I can write a song with open chords"
01:02:23;01:02:24;"and I don't have to impress myself"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"to impress an audience, you know?"
01:02:26;01:02:27;"- Right, sometimes all you need to do"
01:02:27;01:02:31;"is switch up one thing to kind of make it original."
01:02:31;01:02:31;"- Yeah."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"- All right, well, thanks a lot, Carson."
01:02:33;01:02:33;"Have fun at Sundance."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"- All right, thank you."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"- Talk to you soon, dude."
01:02:35;01:02:36;"- Thanks for having me on."
01:02:36;01:02:37;"- All right, peace."
01:02:37;01:02:38;"- All right, take care, y'all."
01:02:38;01:02:38;"- Peace."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"- Bye-bye."

01:04:16;01:04:20;"- All right, Jake, so we got an email recently."
01:04:20;01:04:21;"- Yeah."
01:04:21;01:04:23;"- That had some big questions in it."
01:04:23;01:04:24;"- Yeah, it's a long email."
01:04:24;01:04:27;"- The first part of the email concerns this kid, Hannah,"
01:04:27;01:04:32;"going to a VW show in 2013, Lollapalooza,"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"and someone crashing the stage"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"and screaming ""Ezzy"" for Prezzy."
01:04:36;01:04:37;"Do you remember that?"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"Also at this show, a pantless man crashed the stage"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"and got decked by security guard."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"Question one, I'm wondering if you remember this moment."
01:04:43;01:04:46;"- I remember at Lollapalooza,"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"although I don't think I fully clocked it"
01:04:48;01:04:49;"'cause I was performing,"
01:04:49;01:04:50;"I know somebody ran on stage"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"and the security guard just grabbed them."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"It was really like hardcore."
01:04:55;01:04:57;"- But ""Ezzy"" for Prezzy is not ringing a bell?"
01:04:57;01:05:00;"- I remember people saying that."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"I don't remember on stage."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"I was in the zone, man."
01:05:02;01:05:04;"I was performing. - You're working."
01:05:04;01:05:05;"- I was just deep in the cut,"
01:05:05;01:05:06;"feeling the rhythms of the music."
01:05:06;01:05:09;"- Second half of the email."
01:05:09;01:05:11;"Like I said, I'm a big fan of the show"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"and have many connections to the TC world."
01:05:13;01:05:14;"I worked at Whole Foods for two weeks"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"and I have a friend whose number got blocked"
01:05:16;01:05:19;"by Ben and Jerry's for calling in too much,"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"demanding they bring back the plain chocolate flavor."
01:05:21;01:05:23;"I live in Minneapolis."
01:05:23;01:05:23;"- I know."
01:05:23;01:05:25;"- Okay, we will talk about some other,"
01:05:25;01:05:26;"they don't have plain chocolate."
01:05:26;01:05:28;"- In Minneapolis and love sweet Martha's."
01:05:28;01:05:31;"I even have been a long time fan of GBV."
01:05:31;01:05:33;"However, the one thing I can't get on board with"
01:05:33;01:05:35;"is the Grateful Dead."
01:05:35;01:05:37;"I find all their music to be pretty similar."
01:05:37;01:05:38;"I get bored by them."
01:05:38;01:05:41;"In my opinion, they are similar to Of Montreal"
01:05:41;01:05:44;"in the way that they maybe have some truly hidden gems,"
01:05:44;01:05:47;"but there's a lot of noise to sort through to find them."
01:05:47;01:05:49;"Additionally, the one time I listened to the dead"
01:05:49;01:05:50;"is as follows."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"And so I guess it soured my opinion on them."
01:05:52;01:05:54;"My dad often gets cassette tapes from Goodwill."
01:05:54;01:05:57;"And one day he brought back a Grateful Dead tape."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"He suggested I listen to it."
01:05:58;01:06:01;"So when I was driving to visit my friend at Grinnell College,"
01:06:01;01:06:02;"I popped in the cassette."
01:06:02;01:06:04;"I wasn't too impressed by the music,"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"but everything was going fine."
01:06:06;01:06:06;"The band was jamming."
01:06:06;01:06:07;"It was all okay."
01:06:07;01:06:09;"When suddenly just five miles outside of Grinnell"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"in the middle of nowhere, Iowa,"
01:06:11;01:06:14;"my car got out of control and I ended up in a ditch."
01:06:14;01:06:17;"The mechanic thinks the tire came off the rim or something."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"So I'm in the ditch, adrenaline pumping,"
01:06:19;01:06:21;"and Jerry Garcia is still playing in the background."
01:06:21;01:06:22;"And at this point,"
01:06:22;01:06:23;"this is the last time I actually listened"
01:06:23;01:06:24;"to the Grateful Dead."
01:06:24;01:06:26;"Maybe I'm completely missing the point."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"And the whole point was watching them live."
01:06:28;01:06:29;"But if that's the case, I don't get it."
01:06:29;01:06:32;"Because why would I want to go see a live band?"
01:06:32;01:06:33;"These music I don't enjoy."
01:06:33;01:06:34;"Not live."
01:06:34;01:06:36;"But anyway, I haven't completely shut the door on the dead."
01:06:36;01:06:38;"And would really appreciate if Jake made a playlist"
01:06:38;01:06:41;"for listeners who are lukewarm about them"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"that highlights some of their more approachable songs."
01:06:43;01:06:45;"Well, Hannah, I did just that."
01:06:45;01:06:47;"I did the heavy lifting for you."
01:06:47;01:06:50;"- Tom Crizes, we care about our listeners."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"We care about your opinions."
01:06:51;01:06:54;"And when you make a request, it might actually happen."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"- It might."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"- We're not one of those big time internet radio shows"
01:06:57;01:07:00;"where you're just one of millions"
01:07:00;01:07:00;"that we don't care about."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"- Shouting into the void."
01:07:02;01:07:05;"I did make a Jake's Beginner's Guide"
01:07:05;01:07:07;"to the Grateful Dead playlist."
01:07:07;01:07:10;"And yeah, as you say, the band is known for being a jam band."
01:07:10;01:07:15;"I tried to focus this playlist on great songwriting."
01:07:15;01:07:18;"So this playlist runs over two and a half hours."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"'Cause there is like a 14 minute Eyes of the World"
01:07:20;01:07:23;"and there's a 25 minute Scarfire."
01:07:23;01:07:27;"But outside of that, there's a lot of really solid"
01:07:27;01:07:29;"four minute, five minute songs."
01:07:29;01:07:33;"Exemplary songwriting, great singing, great guitar playing."
01:07:33;01:07:36;"I think the dead, like in a way, are a great pop band."
01:07:36;01:07:39;"I mean, they write great catchy tunes."
01:07:39;01:07:41;"And if they didn't write great songs,"
01:07:41;01:07:42;"I wouldn't care about their jams."
01:07:42;01:07:45;"- Before I really got deeper into the dead,"
01:07:45;01:07:49;"I was similar because I knew some of the early hits."
01:07:49;01:07:52;"I love songs like Uncle John's Band."
01:07:52;01:07:54;"But then I'd find a record and listen to something else,"
01:07:54;01:07:55;"like a live record."
01:07:55;01:07:59;"I wasn't ready for some of these longer exploratory jams."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"So I think starting with the songs is a great way"
01:08:01;01:08:02;"to get into the dead."
01:08:02;01:08:04;"'Cause also, I think she's right."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"It is more interesting to hear a 10 minute version"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"of a song when you know the song."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"- When you know the song."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"- 100%."
01:08:10;01:08:12;"- And she's also right that there's a lot of garbage"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"in their catalog."
01:08:14;01:08:16;"- It's like with anything you really love,"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"at a certain point, I think I even said this to you once,"
01:08:18;01:08:21;"I knew that I was becoming more of a deadhead"
01:08:21;01:08:24;"when I started to become fascinated by the bad stuff."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"When you really become a fan of something,"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"you can at least find a sense of humor"
01:08:28;01:08:32;"or historical importance even in a bad song, a bad show."
01:08:32;01:08:32;"- Absolutely."
01:08:32;01:08:34;"I mean, that's when you know you're ahead."
01:08:34;01:08:37;"You're going deep into like 80s Dylan."
01:08:37;01:08:39;"I mean, you know them Ride or Die, GBV."
01:08:39;01:08:42;"They have a ton of just wretched music"
01:08:42;01:08:44;"that I find a way into."
01:08:44;01:08:46;"- I'm really banking on this for the future"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"of Vampire Weekend because when we start dropping"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"eight minute Cape Cod's in the set."
01:08:50;01:08:52;"- Eight minute Cape Cod."
01:08:52;01:08:53;"- Not gonna kill it every night."
01:08:53;01:08:55;"If we drop an eight minute Cape Cod,"
01:08:55;01:09:00;"October 7th, 2018, Eugene, Oregon,"
01:09:00;01:09:01;"and it's kind of an off night,"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"I hope people will, you know."
01:09:03;01:09:04;"- Hang in."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"- Hang in, 'cause maybe the next night."
01:09:05;01:09:07;"- In Eureka, California."
01:09:07;01:09:08;"- In Eureka, California, we nailed it."
01:09:08;01:09:09;"- We nailed it."
01:09:09;01:09:10;"- 'Cause that's real fan stuff."
01:09:10;01:09:12;"But also you can't expect everybody to be a real fan."
01:09:12;01:09:14;"- I don't diss Fairweather fans."
01:09:14;01:09:16;"They have a place in the universe too."
01:09:16;01:09:18;"- I think you need to release more songs though."
01:09:18;01:09:21;"I think you need to start releasing SoundCloud albums."
01:09:21;01:09:22;"- Vampire Weekend does?"
01:09:22;01:09:22;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:09:22;01:09:26;"Or like weird Ezra Koenig, like pseudonym side projects."
01:09:26;01:09:28;"'Cause there's just not enough material."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"- I know."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"Well we'll have a new album soon."
01:09:30;01:09:31;"- I know, you have like a big album coming out."
01:09:31;01:09:32;"- Yeah."
01:09:32;01:09:34;"- But I'm saying, to get to that space of like"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"the heads really going deep and like finding"
01:09:36;01:09:39;"the weird kind of bad stuff and like,"
01:09:39;01:09:40;"kind of delighting in that."
01:09:40;01:09:41;"- Right."
01:09:41;01:09:42;"- You need to cut out like a box set."
01:09:42;01:09:45;"- I just have such high standards"
01:09:45;01:09:46;"for Vampire Weekend records."
01:09:46;01:09:47;"- I know you do."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"- It'd be interesting if we did kind of tiers."
01:09:49;01:09:51;"If Vampire Weekend was Banana Republic."
01:09:51;01:09:52;"- Right."
01:09:52;01:09:54;"- But we also need to have The Gap and Old Navy"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"in terms of having like a lower price point."
01:09:56;01:09:57;"- Yeah."
01:09:57;01:09:58;"- So it could be Vampire Weekend,"
01:09:58;01:10:01;"maybe then a level below is called VW Express."
01:10:01;01:10:04;"(laughing)"
01:10:04;01:10:05;"- I love it."
01:10:05;01:10:07;"- And then like the real low price point,"
01:10:07;01:10:10;"the Old Navy would be, I don't know, W & Co?"
01:10:10;01:10:11;"- Cod."
01:10:11;01:10:11;"- Cod."
01:10:11;01:10:13;"(laughing)"
01:10:13;01:10:15;"Cape Cod Code Factory."
01:10:15;01:10:17;"That's where it's dropping."
01:10:17;01:10:19;"Not even the stuff that didn't make the album,"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"but the stuff that didn't even make the pile."
01:10:21;01:10:24;"- That's just like your like voice memo recordings."
01:10:24;01:10:24;"- Yeah."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"Actually that night in Eugene,"
01:10:26;01:10:30;"the eight minute Cape Cod, for about a minute,"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"went into one of those voice memos."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"One of the rare voice memos."
01:10:34;01:10:34;"- Never did it again."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"(laughing)"
01:10:36;01:10:37;"Well anyway."
01:10:37;01:10:39;"- So the playlist is up, you just go to the"
01:10:39;01:10:42;"Time Crisis page, On Demand,"
01:10:42;01:10:43;"and you'll find a Jake's Beginner's Guide"
01:10:43;01:10:47;"to the Grateful Dead, end 1968 to 1987."
01:10:47;01:10:48;"There's definitely some great songs."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"We got Box of Rain, man."
01:10:50;01:10:53;"We got China Cat, Ripple, beautiful song."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"Great Cryptocurrency."
01:10:54;01:10:57;"We got Touch of Grey, a lot of great stuff."

01:12:27;01:12:28;"- Yep."
01:12:28;01:12:33;"- It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:12:33;01:12:37;"- We're comparing the top five songs on iTunes"
01:12:37;01:12:42;"this week in 2018 to the top five Billboard hits of 1987."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"Why did we choose 1987?"
01:12:44;01:12:48;"- Because that's the last year on my Grateful Dead playlist."
01:12:48;01:12:48;"- Okay."
01:12:48;01:12:51;"- And it was the year that they released ""Touch of Gray,"""
01:12:51;01:12:53;"which was their biggest hit."
01:12:53;01:12:55;"And we haven't done any 80s in a while,"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"and '87 almost kind of resonated to me."
01:12:57;01:13:00;"That's a big year for big albums."
01:13:00;01:13:05;"It's like ""Joshua Tree,"" ""Appetite,"" ""Tunnel of Love,"""
01:13:05;01:13:07;"""Deaf Leopard Hysteria,"" you know."

01:13:34;01:13:36;"- A big hit album that could be releasing singles"

01:19:08;01:19:09;"a super basic top 40 show."
01:19:09;01:19:10;"- Yeah."
01:19:10;01:19:12;"- Madonna, one of the greatest of all time."
01:19:12;01:19:13;"So many great hits."

01:19:22;01:19:23;"- You know, she took risks."
01:19:23;01:19:24;"- She took risks."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"- Hell of an artist."
01:19:26;01:19:30;"And back to 2018,"
01:19:30;01:19:33;"a younger artist already off to a great start."
01:19:33;01:19:35;"Could she be the next Madonna?"
01:19:35;01:19:35;"Who knows?"
01:19:35;01:19:37;"She's got the chops."
01:19:37;01:19:40;"She used to be in a girl group called Fifth Harmony,"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"but she went solo."
01:19:42;01:19:45;"She was born in Cuba in a town called Havana,"
01:19:45;01:19:48;"which is also the name of her breakout single."
01:19:48;01:19:51;"This is Camila Cabello featuring Young Thug with Havana."
01:19:54;01:19:58;"- My crazy jigger, this is that kind of Latin feel."
01:19:58;01:20:03;"- I was listening to 60s on 6 on the drive in."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"And like, I don't know what, like,"
01:20:05;01:20:06;"so they have a DJ, which is,"
01:20:06;01:20:09;"completely defeats the point of satellite radio."
01:20:09;01:20:10;"I just play the 60s hits."
01:20:10;01:20:11;"That's all I want to hear."
01:20:11;01:20:12;"- Yeah."
01:20:12;01:20:13;"- And I think there's like,"
01:20:13;01:20:16;"this is some old guy reading copy that someone hands him."
01:20:16;01:20:19;"And he was like, and he crams it in, in like 20 seconds,"
01:20:19;01:20:22;"in between like the temptations and like,"
01:20:22;01:20:23;"you know, Elvis or something."
01:20:23;01:20:25;"- And just like a fact about the 60s or something."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"- And no, it was so random."
01:20:26;01:20:29;"It was like, this woman I just read about on the internet"
01:20:29;01:20:33;"has a fetish where she likes to chew up food"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"and then give it to her husband."
01:20:35;01:20:36;"How about that for a first date?"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"And then just goes into like,"
01:20:38;01:20:39;"and I was just like,"
01:20:39;01:20:42;"it actively like bummed me out."
01:20:42;01:20:44;"(laughing)"
01:20:44;01:20:45;"- Are we fucking up here?"
01:20:45;01:20:46;"Should Time Crisis just be like,"
01:20:46;01:20:48;"we just play the hits of the day."
01:20:48;01:20:51;"- I mean, that is what a lot of radio is like."
01:20:51;01:20:52;"It's like morning drive time shows."
01:20:52;01:20:55;"They're just kind of like looking at news items"
01:20:55;01:20:58;"that are just like something shocking."
01:20:58;01:21:01;"Crazy story out of Lawrence, Kansas."
01:21:01;01:21:04;"A man came home to find his wife with another man,"
01:21:04;01:21:07;"but it wasn't just any man."
01:21:07;01:21:08;"Turns out."
01:21:08;01:21:11;"- I think these go really dark."
01:21:11;01:21:12;"It was her brother."
01:21:12;01:21:15;"- Turns out it was her own brother."
01:21:15;01:21:16;"- It was their 19 year old son."
01:21:16;01:21:19;"(explosion)"
01:21:19;01:21:20;"- And then just like."
01:21:20;01:21:22;"- And then yeah, just like triggering effects."
01:21:22;01:21:23;"That's just wrong."
01:21:23;01:21:29;"Anyway, here's Camila Cabello with Havana"
01:21:29;01:21:30;"featuring Young Thug."
01:21:30;01:21:38;"I read an article about Camila Cabello."
01:21:38;01:21:39;"- Yeah."
01:21:39;01:21:40;"- Her album came out."
01:21:40;01:21:42;"So, you know, she's doing big press"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"and there was like a New York Times feature about her"
01:21:44;01:21:46;"and it talked about her struggles,"
01:21:46;01:21:49;"how when she left Fifth Harmony,"
01:21:49;01:21:52;"the other girls in the group were very rude to her"
01:21:52;01:21:56;"and they publicly at an award show shamed her."
01:21:56;01:21:58;"- Was this in Cuba?"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"- No, she grew up in America."
01:22:00;01:22:02;"She grew up in Florida."
01:22:02;01:22:04;"No, this is recently like the other girls"
01:22:04;01:22:05;"in the girl group."
01:22:05;01:22:06;"- Oh, I don't know Fifth Harmony."
01:22:06;01:22:07;"Is that, I didn't."
01:22:07;01:22:09;"- At all?"
01:22:09;01:22:10;"- Never heard of them."
01:22:10;01:22:11;"- They're a major girl group."
01:22:11;01:22:12;"- Okay."
01:22:12;01:22:13;"- And now it's only four of them."
01:22:13;01:22:14;"- I guess after she left,"
01:22:14;01:22:17;"they kind of made some show about,"
01:22:17;01:22:19;"they opened an award show where you saw"
01:22:19;01:22:22;"the silhouettes of five women on stage."
01:22:22;01:22:25;"And then suddenly one of them gets comically yanked off."
01:22:25;01:22:27;"Almost like a cartoon."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"And then the four of them come"
01:22:28;01:22:29;"and it was their way of being like,"
01:22:29;01:22:31;"oh, we don't need her."
01:22:31;01:22:32;"And she was watching it with her mom"
01:22:32;01:22:33;"and she had hurt her feelings."
01:22:33;01:22:35;"- But she sounds traumatic."
01:22:35;01:22:36;"I mean, if you--"
01:22:36;01:22:37;"- She's having the last laugh."
01:22:37;01:22:38;"Her album went, this album went to number one."
01:22:38;01:22:39;"- Yeah, man."
01:22:39;01:22:40;"I mean, if you were in that situation,"
01:22:40;01:22:43;"it would be traumatic and stressful."
01:22:43;01:22:48;"But as an outside observer, it's pretty funny."
01:22:48;01:22:49;"- Well, I don't know about that."
01:22:49;01:22:52;"- Bands arguing with each other is funny."
01:22:52;01:22:53;"- Yeah."
01:22:53;01:22:56;"Maybe in 30 years, there'll be a Fifth Harmony documentary"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"that our children will enjoy the way"
01:22:58;01:23:00;"that we enjoy the Eagles documentary."
01:23:00;01:23:02;"- Dude, I started watching a documentary"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"on Chicago last night."
01:23:04;01:23:05;"- Oh yeah, I watched the first half of it."
01:23:05;01:23:06;"- Did you?"
01:23:06;01:23:07;"- Yeah."
01:23:07;01:23:08;"- No satire."
01:23:08;01:23:08;"- Yeah."
01:23:08;01:23:11;"- It's like Peter Satara declined interview."
01:23:11;01:23:12;"- Lot of drama."
01:23:12;01:23:14;"- Yeah, I love how it's like,"
01:23:14;01:23:17;"also in that band, it's like the kind of like"
01:23:17;01:23:18;"knucklehead horn section."
01:23:18;01:23:19;"- Right."
01:23:19;01:23:21;"- It's the good time horn section."

01:48:37;01:48:39;"famous 4th of July parties are at her mansion"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"in Rhode Island."
01:48:41;01:48:42;"So it's a little bit--"
01:48:42;01:48:43;"- Rhode Island?"
01:48:43;01:48:43;"- Yeah."
01:48:43;01:48:44;"- Wow."
01:48:44;01:48:46;"- In like Newport, where there's like the fancy old--"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"- There used to be all those crazy houses there."
01:48:48;01:48:49;"- Yeah, like the Vanderbilts and stuff."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"- Have you been?"
01:48:50;01:48:51;"- No."
01:48:51;01:48:52;"- Haven't gotten the invite."
01:48:52;01:48:53;"- Haven't gotten the invite."
01:48:53;01:48:54;"- Wait till the next album comes out."
01:48:54;01:48:58;"- I know, once I FaceTimed with somebody who was there."
01:48:58;01:48:58;"- That's tight."
01:48:58;01:49:00;"- On 4th of July."
01:49:00;01:49:01;"It's in a dark room."
01:49:01;01:49:03;"But these are famous parties."
01:49:03;01:49:04;"Everybody knows."
01:49:04;01:49:06;"All Americans know that Taylor Swift"
01:49:06;01:49:08;"has her parties in Rhode Island."
01:49:08;01:49:10;"- So people are like driving from like--"
01:49:10;01:49:12;"- No, there's probably a lot of PJs."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"- Oh, people are flying into Providence."
01:49:14;01:49:17;"- Yeah, she's not inviting just like Joe Schmo."
01:49:17;01:49:18;"- Of course not."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"But I'm saying like people are driving up from New York."
01:49:20;01:49:23;"- Maybe, there's probably a private airport in Newport."
01:49:23;01:49:26;"But my point is, it's off the beaten path."
01:49:26;01:49:29;"So I don't know what Cherry Seaborn's deal is"
01:49:29;01:49:31;"if she lives in England or America or what."
01:49:31;01:49:34;"But I doubt she's anywhere close to Rhode Island."
01:49:34;01:49:36;"So again, that's a pretty extreme first date."
01:49:36;01:49:37;"- Yeah, that is, I see."
01:49:37;01:49:39;"Forget it was Taylor Swift."
01:49:39;01:49:40;"Even if you were just like,"
01:49:40;01:49:43;"if you were asking anybody out on a first date,"
01:49:43;01:49:46;"would it be in another country or another state?"
01:49:46;01:49:47;"Even just another state."
01:49:47;01:49:49;"Let's say Cherry lives in New York."
01:49:49;01:49:50;"She got a green card."
01:49:50;01:49:53;"She's working in marketing in New York."
01:49:53;01:49:54;"And Ed's like, ""Hey listen, you wanna hang out"
01:49:54;01:49:55;"""around 4th of July?"""
01:49:55;01:49:57;"And she's like, ""Well, you know, Ed, I'm English like you."

01:50:02;01:50:03;"And she's like, ""Where is it?"""
01:50:03;01:50:05;"And he's like, ""Oh, it's at Taylor Swift's house"

01:50:06;01:50:07;"She's like, ""What's Rhode Island?"""

01:50:10;01:50:12;"""About a four hour drive from here."""
01:50:12;01:50:14;"She's like, ""Okay."""

01:50:17;01:50:20;"That's not a cool thing to do as a guy."

01:53:47;01:53:51;"for the next eight months with this."
01:53:51;01:53:52;"Have you heard it yet?"
01:53:52;01:53:54;"Yeah, I threw it on once."
01:53:54;01:53:55;"You sound pretty nonplussed."
01:53:55;01:53:56;"It's good."
01:53:56;01:54:00;"It's just, Drake has set the bar so high, you know?"
01:54:00;01:54:02;"It's always good, but it's like,"
01:54:02;01:54:05;"now people expect Drake to reinvent the wheel every time."

01:54:51;01:54:53;"- I don't know how to evaluate this one."
01:54:53;01:54:54;"- Well. - Sounds like a Drake song."
01:54:54;01:54:55;"- Let me read a description."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"God's plan is a feel good track"
01:54:57;01:54:59;"that discusses Drake's future."
01:54:59;01:55:00;"Being who he is in the industry,"
01:55:00;01:55:02;"he knows that people want him to fail."
01:55:02;01:55:05;"However, God won't let him do that."
01:55:05;01:55:06;"- People want him to fail?"
01:55:06;01:55:09;"- Oh yeah, it's like every Drake song is about the haters."
01:55:09;01:55:11;"Everybody wants him to fail."
01:55:11;01:55:13;"♪ Hey, hey ♪"

01:55:31;01:55:33;"♪ Without 40 Ollie, there be no me ♪"
01:55:33;01:55:34;"- Another key subject of the song"
01:55:34;01:55:37;"is the separation Drake feels that he needs to have"
01:55:37;01:55:39;"from those outside his inner circle."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"Anyone who tries to work their way into his life"
01:55:41;01:55:45;"must have an ulterior motive to benefit themselves."
01:55:45;01:55:48;"I know that feeling."
01:55:50;01:55:51;"Those are the classic Drake themes."
01:55:51;01:55:54;"Can't trust anybody outside his circle"
01:55:54;01:55:55;"and the haters want him to fail"
01:55:55;01:55:58;"and other rappers don't want him to be successful."
01:55:58;01:56:00;"For Drake to really-- - Great paranoid world vision."
01:56:00;01:56:01;"- What?"
01:56:01;01:56:03;"And look, heavy as the head that wears the crown, man."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"I'm sure it's not easy being Drake."
01:56:05;01:56:08;"We see from the outside Drake is this very successful dude,"
01:56:08;01:56:12;"but to stay on top, once you get there,"
01:56:12;01:56:13;"every waking moment you gotta worry."
01:56:13;01:56:15;"- That's hilarious."
01:56:15;01:56:18;"- I'm not trying to lead that life, you know?"
01:56:18;01:56:22;"That's why I take my time making albums."
01:56:22;01:56:24;"- You're content with your album"
01:56:24;01:56:28;"peaking at 78, 77 on the Billboard charts?"
01:56:28;01:56:30;"- Of course not, but I'm just trying."
01:56:30;01:56:32;"(laughs)"
01:56:32;01:56:34;"Well, maybe I'm not dissimilar from Drake."
01:56:34;01:56:35;"He's just more successful."
01:56:35;01:56:36;"- You want it."
01:56:36;01:56:37;"- We just want it."
01:56:37;01:56:39;"I'm just trying to be more laid back."
01:56:39;01:56:43;"Say, all right, I mean, Drake has a lot more to lose."
01:56:43;01:56:45;"He is an incredibly successful guy."
01:56:45;01:56:47;"I guess for Drake to really do something"
01:56:47;01:56:50;"like totally surprising, he would need to drop"
01:56:50;01:56:55;"like a song that was about how much he hates his inner circle"
01:56:55;01:56:59;"and he's sick of 40 and all the same old guys"
01:56:59;01:57:01;"and he really likes to go meet strangers"
01:57:01;01:57:04;"'cause that's been an old Drake theme, no new friends."
01:57:04;01:57:05;"It'd be interesting if he's like,"
01:57:05;01:57:08;"you know what, I'm kind of sick of the same old guys."
01:57:08;01:57:11;"Actually, my passion now is travel"
01:57:11;01:57:13;"and I like meeting different people"
01:57:13;01:57:15;"and I like being friends with other rappers"
01:57:15;01:57:17;"and I don't know if I can trust them"
01:57:17;01:57:17;"'cause they might want my spot,"
01:57:17;01:57:19;"but that's okay 'cause I already did my thing"
01:57:19;01:57:22;"and I've been smart with my money"
01:57:22;01:57:24;"and they can have the crown if they want to."
01:57:24;01:57:26;"- He just gets super Henry Rollins on it."
01:57:26;01:57:29;"(laughing)"
01:57:29;01:57:30;"- 'Cause he's been talking about the same stuff"
01:57:30;01:57:31;"for a long time."
01:57:31;01:57:32;"It's gotta be stressful."
01:57:32;01:57:35;"If Drake's inner life is really the way he describes it,"
01:57:35;01:57:36;"that's stressful."
01:57:36;01:57:38;"He's not enjoying his success."
01:57:38;01:57:39;"- Yeah, that's a bummer."
01:57:39;01:57:40;"- I guess nobody really does."
01:57:40;01:57:42;"That's the catch 22."
01:57:42;01:57:44;"That's the number one song in 2018."
01:57:44;01:57:47;"Kind of better than ""At This Moment"""
01:57:47;01:57:49;"by Billy Vera and the Beaters."
01:57:49;01:57:50;"- I think that's fair."
01:57:50;01:57:53;"(hip hop music)"
01:57:53;01:58:14;"- Another hell of a show, Jake."
01:58:14;01:58:15;"- Oh yeah."
01:58:15;01:58:17;"- Thanks to Carson Mel for calling in."

01:58:33;01:58:34;"Have a good one."
