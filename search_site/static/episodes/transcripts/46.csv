00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, the first week of summer 2017."
00:05;00:11;"I'll be joined by Jake in the studio, as we discuss the Roger Waters concert we saw a few days ago."
00:11;00:16;"We'll also speak with Mark Schatzker, author of The Dorito Effect,"
00:16;00:23;"as well as Kenny, a Time Crisis listener who's going to bring some youthful enthusiasm to the program."
00:23;00:27;"All this, plus the top ten songs of the summer."
00:27;00:33;"Mask off, this is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:33;00:35;"Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep."
00:35;00:38;"Spawn in one."
00:38;00:44;"They pass me by, all of those great romances."
00:44;00:51;"They were a first for me, all my rightful chances."
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go."
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:10;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:16;01:37;"We're the lonely men."
01:37;01:40;"In the summertime, when the weather is high,"
01:40;01:43;"you can stretch right up and touch the sky."
01:43;01:49;"When the weather's fine, you got women, you got women on your mind."
01:49;01:54;"Have a drink, have a drive, go out and see what you can find."
01:54;01:57;"If a daddy's rich, take her out for a meal."
01:57;02:00;"If a daddy's poor, just do what you feel."
02:00;02:06;"Speed along the lane, you can dine or return at twenty-five."
02:06;02:12;"When the sun goes down, you can make it big or good and only buy."
02:12;02:15;"We're happy, but we're not dirty, we're not mean."
02:15;02:18;"We love everybody, but we do as we please."
02:18;02:23;"When the weather's fine, we go fishing or go swimming in the sea."
02:23;02:29;"We're always happy, life's for living, yeah, that's our philosophy."
02:29;02:31;"Sing along with us."
02:31;02:46;"(scatting)"
02:46;03:03;"(scatting)"
03:03;03:06;"When the winter's here, yeah, it's party time."
03:06;03:09;"Bring your bottle, wag your back 'cause it'll soon be summertime."
03:09;03:15;"And we'll sing again, we'll go driving or maybe we'll settle down."
03:15;03:19;"It's just rich, it's just nice, bring your friends and we'll all go into town."
03:19;03:22;"Time Crisis, we're back."
03:22;03:25;"I'm here in Los Angeles with Jake Longstreth. What's up, Jake?"
03:25;03:27;"Hey."
03:27;03:29;"It's officially summer 2017, can you believe it?"
03:29;03:31;"Sort of, yeah."
03:31;03:33;"Seems about right."
03:33;03:38;"Yeah, well, I mean, the year's flying by, but it's been so hot recently that it's like, okay, yeah, it's summer."
03:38;03:39;"It is hot."
03:39;03:41;"It's been scorching."
03:41;03:42;"Don't appreciate that."
03:42;03:44;"I don't have AC in my studio."
03:44;03:46;"In your painting studio?"
03:46;03:50;"Yeah, so I'm working shirtless, wearing shorts all day."
03:50;03:52;"Just like dripping in sweat?"
03:52;03:54;"Not dripping, I got some fans going."
03:54;03:57;"Do you do like a wet paper towel on the back of your neck?"
03:57;04:02;"Sometimes, I'll go into the bathroom and just like splash water on my face and like wet my hair down and just do the full--"
04:02;04:07;"That's not bad for your painting materials and the paintings themselves."
04:07;04:08;"Oh, in the heat?"
04:08;04:09;"In the heat, yeah."
04:09;04:11;"The paint does dry a little faster, I do notice."
04:11;04:13;"Oh, so it's a positive thing."
04:13;04:15;"Well, it depends what you're doing."
04:15;04:16;"Right."
04:16;04:17;"Oh, it wouldn't be good for oil painting."
04:17;04:22;"If you're trying to blend a big sky area, you're a little more into the gun."
04:22;04:28;"I'm trying to create an even gradient with oil paint over like a 12-square-foot area."
04:28;04:30;"I got to hustle."
04:30;04:32;"Right, maybe save those pieces for winter."
04:32;04:34;"Got to do them now, dude."
04:34;04:35;"Deadlines."
04:35;04:37;"You're just like, okay."
04:37;04:44;"No, these are the things that you don't get to talk to a painter every day about their actual craft, you know?"
04:44;04:45;"Yeah."
04:45;04:48;"You see all these paintings hanging everywhere in museums and this and that."
04:48;04:49;"You never think about the--"
04:49;04:51;"It's a physical object."
04:51;04:53;"You got to like take raw materials and--"
04:53;04:54;"This is a random question."
04:54;04:55;"Okay."
04:55;04:58;"I was at a makeup artist's birthday party recently."
04:58;04:59;"Cool."
04:59;05:00;"Got me thinking about makeup."
05:00;05:04;"Do you feel any kinship--and also hearing you talking about blending gradients--"
05:04;05:09;"do you feel any kinship with makeup artists or just people who take makeup seriously?"
05:09;05:11;"I can see it."
05:11;05:13;"Because you know there's a big thing now, contouring."
05:13;05:15;"What's that?"
05:15;05:22;"It's a way of putting on makeup that I think can make the shape of your face look a little different or create the illusion of shadow."
05:22;05:23;"Don't quote me on this."
05:23;05:24;"Whatever."
05:24;05:27;"It's like advanced makeup study, but at a certain point, it is painting."
05:27;05:29;"Yeah, absolutely."
05:29;05:32;"I mean, yeah, I guess you're trying to create dynamics and depth."
05:32;05:33;"Yeah, exactly."
05:33;05:35;"Or shift the palette."
05:35;05:43;"I mean, and then you get to like the real crazy stuff where somebody could make--look like they're a cat or look like they have a wound or something."
05:43;05:46;"And then you really--is it makeup or is it painting?"
05:46;05:48;"It's body painting."
05:48;05:55;"Speaking of makeup and painting, who did we see this week at the Pink Floyd show sitting in front of us?"
05:55;05:56;"Marilyn Manson."
05:56;05:57;"Right."
05:57;05:58;"At the Roger Waters show."
05:58;05:59;"Without makeup."
05:59;06:01;"Without makeup, although--"
06:01;06:03;"He might have had some sort of foundation on."
06:03;06:05;"Yeah, maybe he had some foundation or maybe he is just like--"
06:05;06:08;"Very even tone on his skin."
06:08;06:11;"Maybe he's just one of those lucky people with even tone."
06:11;06:14;"Very light skin, yeah."
06:14;06:15;"Very, very white."
06:15;06:16;"He doesn't go outside at all."
06:16;06:17;"Honestly, that's possible."
06:17;06:19;"He could be nocturnal."
06:48;07:00;"So let's talk about it."
07:00;07:03;"I lucked into some tickets to Roger Waters at Staples Center."
07:03;07:05;"I'm not the biggest fan."
07:05;07:06;"Right."
07:06;07:08;"But I thought I was on that side of town."
07:08;07:11;"I thought, ""Why not roll down with our other buddy, Ariel?"""
07:11;07:12;"You know, we had an extra ticket."
07:12;07:18;"So the first person I thought of, you know, Roger Waters, I definitely associate with the tasteful palate of '70s rock."
07:18;07:19;"Not so tasteful."
07:19;07:21;"The less than tasteful side of--"
07:21;07:22;"Dude, this is crazy."
07:22;07:25;"I have like Doritos powder in my eye."
07:25;07:29;"Oh, because you're from the spicy nacho?"
07:29;07:30;"I think I do."
07:30;07:31;"Oh, man. That's crazy."
07:31;07:33;"So we have some Doritos in the studio."
07:33;07:34;"Oh, really?"
07:34;07:36;"We got a medical emergency here."
07:36;07:37;"You got to flush your eye."
07:37;07:38;"[beep]"
07:38;07:45;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
07:48;07:52;"Holy [beep]"
07:52;07:53;"I think I'm good."
07:53;07:54;"Or it's salsa."
07:54;07:55;"We may have got some salsa in my eye."
07:55;07:56;"Something."
07:56;07:57;"Oh, yeah."
07:57;07:58;"It's passing."
07:58;08:01;"I think I was the same chick was crushing a burrito before the show started."
08:01;08:03;"Is my eye all red and inflamed?"
08:03;08:04;"It's not crazy."
08:04;08:05;"It's getting better."
08:05;08:07;"I mean, this is a good teachable moment."
08:07;08:08;"Yeah."
08:08;08:10;"If you're eating Doritos, especially--"
08:10;08:11;"Oh."
08:11;08:12;"Wait, what are these called?"
08:12;08:13;"Spicy nacho."
08:13;08:15;"You really got to be careful."
08:15;08:16;"Cool Ranch."
08:16;08:17;"That's a first for me."
08:17;08:19;"Cool Ranch in the eye, no big deal."
08:19;08:22;"Spicy nacho, it's going to take you down."
08:22;08:24;"Took me down a peg."
08:24;08:25;"You feeling okay?"
08:25;08:27;"Yeah."
08:27;08:28;"Yeah, we can continue."
08:28;08:30;"Okay."
08:30;08:33;"So, back to Roger Waters."
08:33;08:35;"We went to the show."
08:35;08:36;"It was at the Staples Center."
08:36;08:40;"Also, something goes down really easy about the name Staples Center."
08:40;08:43;"It's really hilarious to like pause for a second and be like,"
08:43;08:48;"the place where the Lakers and the Clippers and Roger Waters play in Los Angeles"
08:48;08:51;"is named after an office supply store."
08:51;08:52;"I know."
08:52;08:55;"I mean, LA's just lucky that it was Staples that came through"
08:55;08:57;"with the offer to sponsor, not Office Depot."
08:57;08:58;"Right."
08:58;09:02;"Because imagine just like downtown Los Angeles is just like,"
09:02;09:04;"""Welcome to Office Depot Arena."""
09:04;09:07;"[sad trombone music]"
09:07;09:08;"Brutal."
09:08;09:10;"But Staples Center, it sounds like a place that already existed."
09:10;09:14;"It sounds like Jonathan Staples founded it, you know, 1925."
09:14;09:16;"I remember having that confusion."
09:16;09:19;"I think it was built in around 2000 maybe, maybe late '90s."
09:19;09:23;"But I remember hearing the name in the ether and being like,"
09:23;09:24;"""Oh, that's just named after a guy."""
09:24;09:26;"It's like Wrigley Field or something."
09:26;09:29;"It goes down easy, like Wrigley Field or Madison Square Garden."
09:29;09:33;"And then I remember driving by and being like, ""Oh no, that's Staples."""
09:33;09:35;"Because to me in my mind, I was like,"
09:35;09:39;"""There's no way that this arena is named after an office supply superstore."
09:39;09:41;"There's just no way."""
09:41;09:46;"And also, you know what also why LA lucked out by getting Staples"
09:46;09:49;"is because Center starts with a ""s"" sound."
09:49;09:50;"Yeah."
09:50;09:52;"It really sounds like Staples Center."
09:52;09:53;"Yeah."
09:53;09:56;"I think this is like even if it was Staples Arena,"
09:56;09:58;"you might think more about the Staples."
09:58;10:00;"I just always hear it as Staples Center."
10:00;10:03;"You have to wonder if they took that into consideration."
10:03;10:06;"So if like maybe Office Depot is offering more."
10:06;10:07;"Yeah."
10:07;10:10;"But they're like, ""You know what? Staples Center sounds better."
10:10;10:14;"They're offering 10% less, but it's going to be worth it in the long run"
10:14;10:18;"to take a little less money up front but have a better name."""
10:18;10:19;"Because it's the Lakers."
10:19;10:22;"I mean, that's like a classy legacy brand."
10:22;10:24;"They had to run it by Jack Nicholson."
10:24;10:27;"You can't have the Lakers playing an Office Depot--what is it?"
10:27;10:29;"Office Depot Arena?"
10:29;10:30;"I don't know."
10:30;10:32;"I thought the one you had was pretty good."
10:32;10:34;"""Welcome to the Office Depot."""
10:34;10:35;"Oh, yeah, the Office Depot Arena."
10:35;10:41;"I mean, yeah, it's like you talk about--yeah, LA is a stuck-up city."
10:41;10:42;"I'm not trying to throw shade."
10:42;10:44;"I'm just saying LA and New York are stuck-up cities."
10:44;10:45;"We all know this."
10:45;10:49;"They're big, rich cities, whereas you get a city like New Orleans,"
10:49;10:54;"great city, amazing city, but obviously doesn't have the kind of money"
10:54;10:57;"flowing through New York or LA, has had very difficult luck"
10:57;11:00;"when it comes to Katrina and things like that."
11:00;11:03;"Who do they get to sponsor their arena?"
11:03;11:04;"I don't know."
11:04;11:06;"You don't know where the Pelicans play?"
11:06;11:07;"I don't know."
11:07;11:09;"Smoothie King Arena."
11:09;11:10;"Smoothie? As in 7-Eleven?"
11:10;11:12;"No, no, Smoothie King."
11:12;11:13;"You don't know what Smoothie King is?"
11:13;11:14;"Mm-mm."
11:14;11:17;"Smoothie King is a chain of smoothie places."
11:17;11:18;"Regional chain?"
11:18;11:22;"I'm pretty tapped in, and I've never heard of that."
11:22;11:25;"It's like--is it regional?"
11:25;11:27;"I feel like there's one at JFK or something."
11:27;11:29;"But anyway, my point is like--"
11:29;11:30;"I hear you."
11:30;11:31;"--that, yeah, no--"
11:31;11:34;"Or it's like MetLife Insurance Stadium."
11:34;11:37;"Or in like Boise, Idaho is straight-up Taco Bell Arena."
11:37;11:39;"Oh, wow."
11:39;11:40;"Obviously--"
11:40;11:41;"What is that?"
11:41;11:43;"Is it like minor league hockey or something?"
11:43;11:45;"You know, that's a great question because I always talk about"
11:45;11:48;"Taco Bell Arena, and I don't know much about it other than"
11:48;11:51;"that's where like Katy Perry's going to play when she comes to Boise."
11:51;11:52;"Taco Bell Arena."
11:52;11:57;"So Taco Bell Arena is a multi-purpose--oh, God, this is dark."
11:57;12:00;"Taco Bell Arena, originally BSU Pavilion--"
12:00;12:01;"Okay."
12:01;12:04;"--is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the western United States--"
12:04;12:06;"all right, western, you know, come on, Wikipedia--"
12:06;12:10;"on the campus of Boise State University in Boise, Idaho."
12:10;12:13;"The reason I say that it's very dark is because"
12:13;12:17;"presumably Boise State University is a public college."
12:17;12:20;"Like that's what's happening in America, like a public college"
12:20;12:24;"has their BSU Pavilion, and they have to take--"
12:24;12:27;"they have to literally--a public college has to advertise for Taco Bell?"
12:27;12:28;"Brutal."
13:34;13:44;"Speaking of fast food, you and I were both very fascinated"
13:44;13:47;"at the Roger Waters concert because we were starving."
13:47;13:51;"We thought that we were going to have access to the place called the Chairman's Club."
13:51;13:52;"I was pumped about that."
13:52;13:55;"Yeah, we did not have access. Mistakes were made."
13:55;13:57;"There were serious hierarchies with not only the parking,"
13:57;13:59;"but also the green room situation."
13:59;14:02;"Yeah, this is classic. It's like we roll down in a car with Ariel"
14:02;14:07;"because his buddy who's playing in the band says that we're going to have parking."
14:07;14:12;"See, that's the thing. The price of entry to these concerts is so high."
14:12;14:13;"Yeah."
14:13;14:18;"It's not only the financial burden of the ticket, but just getting in is so tough."
14:18;14:19;"The logistics were--"
14:19;14:23;"Yeah, so of course we roll up to lot one, not on the list."
14:23;14:24;"Which was hard to find."
14:24;14:25;"Very difficult to find."
14:25;14:27;"It was like a labyrinth. It was like 40 minutes."
14:27;14:28;"It was crazy."
14:28;14:32;"I mean, in retrospect, it was kind of cool being on this weird goose chase."
14:32;14:37;"But once we got in, we got to go into the green room, found a couple Coronas."
14:37;14:39;"That's when the night took a positive turn for me."
14:39;14:42;"I was kind of stressed out, hot, and then we finally got in there,"
14:42;14:46;"but remember we get in, we thought it was the Chairman's Club."
14:46;14:47;"We didn't have access."
14:47;14:48;"No chicken wings."
14:48;14:50;"Yeah, we thought we were going to get chicken wings."
14:50;14:52;"And then the guy playing bass in the band was like,"
14:52;14:55;"""Oh, I'll escort you over to the other green room where there's food."""
14:55;14:58;"And then we showed up and there's a bouncer that's like, ""You can't escort."""
14:58;14:59;"Right."
14:59;15:00;"And then right at that point--"
15:00;15:01;"And he said, ""But I have an all-access pass."""
15:01;15:03;"He says, ""But you don't have an all-access escort pass."""
15:03;15:04;"Yeah, so the--"
15:04;15:08;"Oh, and then we watch Dave Navarro enter the room,"
15:08;15:12;"and he hears us talk about how we don't have an escort,"
15:12;15:14;"and he turns around and--he's a very quick guy."
15:14;15:15;"I don't know him."
15:15;15:18;"And he turns around and goes, ""It's a little early in the evening,"
15:18;15:20;"but I know a few escorts."""
15:20;15:21;"[explosion]"
15:21;15:22;"The time had come."
15:22;15:23;"And just rolls in."
15:23;15:25;"I mean, that's kind of what you want from Dave Navarro, I guess."
15:25;15:26;"Yeah, it's perfect."
15:26;15:27;"Yeah."
15:27;15:28;"Well played."

16:06;16:09;"Once we settled in, I was definitely glad we were there."
16:09;16:10;"Yeah, it was a good show."
16:10;16:12;"I mean, I'm not a huge Floyd guy either."
16:12;16:14;"And it was better than I thought it would be."
16:14;16:16;"Yeah, the band was killing it."
16:16;16:18;"He sounded good."
16:18;16:21;"There's a drone pig that flew around the arena."
16:21;16:22;"I've heard about this."
16:22;16:24;"I haven't been in an arena yet where there's just, like,"
16:24;16:27;"a fully droned out thing flying around with no strings."
16:27;16:28;"Yeah."
16:28;16:29;"We're living in the future."
16:29;16:30;"A giant piggy bank."
16:30;16:32;"The visuals were incredible."
16:32;16:37;"So, you know, summertime is a classic time to go catch a great show."
16:37;16:41;"And Jake, you couldn't help point out that the Roger Waters show"
16:41;16:46;"made the Grateful Dead show you'd seen previously this spring, I guess."
16:46;16:47;"A few weeks ago."
16:47;16:48;"Seemed not so hot."
16:48;16:50;"Yeah, pale in comparison."
16:50;16:53;"And it's weird, too, because, you know, obviously I love the dead."
16:53;16:57;"Not a huge Floyd guy, but this is sort of a reverse situation"
16:57;17:01;"where, like, the dead show was a real bummer, I thought."
17:01;17:03;"That was at the Hollywood Bowl."
17:03;17:06;"John Mayer filling in."
17:06;17:10;"And then the Waters show was just, like, very on point, very tight."
17:10;17:11;"It was more professional."
17:11;17:14;"It sounded exactly like the album in, like, a cool way."
17:14;17:15;"Yeah, it was impressive."
17:15;17:16;"Very dynamic."
17:16;17:19;"He seemed really energized and inspired."
17:19;17:20;"73-year-old man."
17:20;17:23;"The guys in the dead just seemed gone."
17:23;17:26;"Now, the people at the show were just, like, drinking it up."
17:26;17:29;"I mean, they just, like, were pounding the Kool-Aid."
17:29;17:32;"I mean, yeah, I guess it's just about what kind of energy"
17:32;17:35;"you bring to an experience."
17:35;17:37;"Well, after the Waters show, I was sort of like,"
17:37;17:40;"""Wow, this was really inspired and, like, really, like."""
17:40;17:41;"It felt fresh."
17:41;17:42;"He brought it."
17:42;17:43;"Yeah."
17:43;17:46;"And then it made the dead show seem so cynical."
17:46;17:47;"Like, what are they doing?"
17:47;17:50;"Are they just doing, like--are they just making money?"
17:50;17:52;"Like, what are they--it just seemed, like, sad to me."
17:52;17:53;"Right."
17:53;17:54;"In retrospect."
17:54;17:57;"Yeah, with Roger Waters, you imagine him, like,"
17:57;18:00;"going over the set list with, like, the musicians."
18:00;18:01;"This could be totally wrong."
18:01;18:05;"Or you imagine him, like, working on the stage show"
18:05;18:06;"with, like, the lighting director and all these guys"
18:06;18:08;"and being like, ""When are we going to bring the pig out?"
18:08;18:10;"Okay, but is it going to go upstage, right?"""
18:10;18:12;"Like, you can imagine--like, clearly a lot of thought went into it."
18:12;18:13;"Yep."
18:13;18:15;"He's not just cashing in."
18:15;18:16;"No."
18:16;18:18;"I mean, I think a lot of us as well as--sometimes do."
18:18;18:19;"You know what I thought of?"
18:19;18:23;"If Hillary had won the election, what would the visuals have been?"
18:23;18:25;"Because it was very Trump-heavy."
18:25;18:26;"Right."
18:26;18:27;"Roger Waters hates Trump."
18:27;18:28;"Trump is a pig."
18:28;18:30;"He said Trump is a pig."
18:30;18:32;"He put up a lot of dumb Trump quotes."
18:32;18:33;"Right."
18:33;18:35;"Like, Trump being an idiot and then Trump is a pig"
18:35;18:37;"and, like, stylized imagery of Trump,"
18:37;18:40;"Trump being on a baby's body, on a pig's body."
18:40;18:41;"Yeah, we--"
18:41;18:43;"Industry footage of, like, Jeff Sessions."
18:43;18:44;"Yeah."
18:44;18:46;"Like, footage of, like, Trump playing golf."
18:46;18:50;"We were talking about--I'm pretty sure when they kicked into money,"
18:50;18:52;"it was an aerial shot of Mar-a-Lago."
18:52;18:53;"Right."
18:53;18:55;"[Humming]"
18:55;18:57;"I remember we were joking, too, about, like,"
18:57;19:00;"some, like, Beverly Hills Republican being at the show"
19:00;19:03;"and just being like, ""I didn't come here for the politics."
19:03;19:04;"I'm here for a rock show."""
20:34;20:37;"So, Jake, we've got a hell of a show to kick off summer."
20:37;20:41;"We're going to be talking to Kenny, a high school student who wrote us a letter."
20:41;20:42;"Right, right."
20:42;20:44;"So we're going to get--because, you know, we talk a lot about"
20:44;20:49;"whether or not the tasteful palette of '70s rock or '90s indie rock is still relevant."
20:49;20:51;"But, you know, we're actually going to talk to somebody,"
20:51;20:53;"an actual high school-age music fan,"
20:53;20:56;"going to enlighten us into what they're listening to."
20:56;20:58;"We're also going to talk about the top ten songs of the summer."
20:58;20:59;"It's about that time."
20:59;21:00;"Oh, wow."
21:00;21:01;"I've got to get serious."
21:01;21:03;"What are the songs of the summer?"
21:03;21:08;"But first, we've got the author of ""The Dorito Effect,"" Mark Schatzker."
21:08;21:11;"His book is about the surprising truth about food and flavor."
21:11;21:14;"And I like this because we talk a lot about Doritos on the show,"
21:14;21:20;"but Mark Schatzker actually kind of has a thesis about how Doritos tell the story"
21:20;21:24;"of what happened to American food and American flavor."
21:24;21:26;"So we're going to talk to Mark after this."
21:41;21:51;"[applause]"
23:41;23:44;"[applause]"
23:44;23:47;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
23:47;23:50;"[phone ringing]"
23:50;23:51;"Hello."
23:51;23:52;"Hey, how are you doing, Mark?"
23:52;23:53;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
23:53;23:54;"I'm doing great."
23:54;23:55;"How are you guys?"
23:55;23:56;"We're great, man."
23:56;24:00;"We're chowing down on some Doritos spicy nacho flavor over here."
24:00;24:01;"Excellent."
24:01;24:02;"My plan is working perfectly."
24:02;24:04;"So, Mark, you got this book, ""The Dorito Effect."""
24:04;24:05;"Yes."
24:05;24:07;"What's it all about?"
24:07;24:12;"""The Dorito Effect"" is basically what happened to food in the last 50 years."
24:12;24:14;"We've been obsessed with kind of what's gone wrong with food,"
24:14;24:17;"and we keep on throwing around theories like we're eating too much fat"
24:17;24:19;"or we're eating too much carbs."
24:19;24:21;"The one thing no one's ever really talked about is flavor,"
24:21;24:23;"because that's what we all love, right?"
24:23;24:24;"How does it taste?"
24:24;24:28;"So this book looks at how the way food tastes has changed,"
24:28;24:33;"and the Dorito Effect, very simply, is what happens when real food gets bland"
24:33;24:35;"and fake food gets super delicious."
24:35;24:40;"The story of Doritos tells us something really important about how food changed,"
24:40;24:42;"and I'll tell you very quickly how it started."
24:42;24:43;"Please."
24:43;24:46;"The VP of sales and marketing for the Frito Chip Company,"
24:46;24:48;"he was working on Madison Avenue in the 1950s."
24:48;24:51;"He was like an ad guy, and he got hired by the Frito Chip Company"
24:51;24:53;"to be the VP of sales and marketing."
24:53;24:57;"Then they merged with the Lay's Chip Company to become Frito Lay."
24:57;25:00;"He took a trip in the early '60s to California,"
25:00;25:02;"and he tasted a tortilla chip for the first time,"
25:02;25:04;"and he thought this is going to be the next big thing."
25:04;25:06;"So he goes back to Dallas."
25:06;25:09;"He pitches to senior executives on this great new idea,"
25:09;25:10;"and they're like, ""Why would you do that?"
25:10;25:11;"Why do we need tortilla chips?"
25:11;25:12;"We've already got Fritos."
25:12;25:14;"They're kind of the same thing."""
25:14;25:19;"But he was so sure that this would be the next thing, he developed it."
25:19;25:23;"He funneled discretionary funds into an off-site facility"
25:23;25:27;"to develop this tortilla chip concept, and he presented it again,"
25:27;25:29;"and he gave it this sort of made-up Spanish-sounding name,"
25:29;25:33;"Mexican-sounding name called Doritos, and he got the green light."
25:33;25:35;"This is when everyone thinks, ""Ah, that's when everything changed."
25:35;25:38;"That's when the world would shift."""
25:38;25:43;"In fact, that's not when it shifted because the first Doritos that went on sale"
25:43;25:49;"were just salted tortilla chips, and they kind of bombed."
25:49;25:53;"Nobody really wanted them in the Southwest where people knew you could dip"
25:53;25:56;"tortilla chips in salsa or guac."
25:56;25:57;"They liked them."
25:57;26:01;"But the complaint everywhere else was that this snack sounds Mexican,"
26:01;26:03;"but it doesn't taste Mexican."
26:03;26:07;"So this guy, his name was Arch West, had to go and talk to his fellow executives again."
26:07;26:11;"He's hauled up in front of them, and they're saying, ""What are you going to do about Doritos?"""
26:11;26:14;"And he said, ""Let's make them taste like taco."""
26:14;26:18;"And this was a seminal moment because before that, you could never--"
26:18;26:22;"that wasn't really possible, but there had been a machine invented in the mid-1950s"
26:22;26:27;"called a gas chromatograph, which meant that scientists could finally identify"
26:27;26:29;"flavor compounds in foods."
26:29;26:32;"And as soon as they figured out what made food taste good,"
26:32;26:37;"they started making those flavor compounds in laboratories and in factories."
26:37;26:42;"And that's why in the mid-1960s it became possible to take a tortilla chip"
26:42;26:46;"and give it that sort of savory tang of a taco."
26:46;26:51;"It doesn't taste exactly like a taco, but it has that same kind of satisfying zing."
26:51;26:54;"And that is what changed the world."
26:54;26:59;"Taco-flavored Doritos, they were--a tortilla chip that nobody wanted to eat"
26:59;27:02;"became a tortilla chip that people couldn't stop eating."
27:02;27:06;"And this is really important because it tells us something about the power"
27:06;27:11;"of flavor over our brains, of flavor literally to make us eat."
27:11;27:14;"So we walk out there in the world into diners and buffets and the supermarket"
27:14;27:18;"and we think, ""I know what I want to eat,"" but the truth is we can't control it."
27:18;27:21;"We're driven by something deeper than that."
27:21;27:24;"And flavor technology was really the gateway."
27:24;27:27;"And it's the Dorito effect because it's not just Doritos."
27:27;27:29;"You see these things everywhere."
27:29;27:31;"Fast food restaurants use them."
27:31;27:34;"They're in things like yogurt. They're in kids' foods. They're in crackers."
27:34;27:36;"They're in pasta sauce. They're in pizza."
27:36;27:38;"They're everywhere."
27:38;27:41;"And that is how we've created this illusion of deliciousness."
27:41;27:45;"We keep on filling our mouths with food that tastes good"
27:45;27:47;"but just isn't what we should be eating."
27:47;27:50;"And we get into this really messed-up relationship where food tastes good"
27:50;27:55;"in the moment and then we feel awful about it for hours, sometimes days later."
27:55;27:59;"So really Dorito was a pioneer in terms of the flavor industry."
27:59;28:02;"Absolutely. Yeah, they forged the way. Absolutely."
28:02;28:05;"So it's kind of a feel-good underdog story."
28:05;28:07;"In a way, yeah."
28:07;28:12;"Doritos comes out, bombs, then they put some weird chemicals on it."
28:12;28:14;"What became of Arch West?"
28:14;28:17;"Arch West, he continued to work for Doritos for a while,"
28:17;28:21;"then I think he did some consulting and he did a lot of volunteer work."
28:21;28:24;"His grandson reached out to me actually after the book came out."
28:24;28:27;"He reached out to me on Facebook and I thought he would have horrible things to say,"
28:27;28:29;"but he's actually a food activist."
28:29;28:33;"He lives in the Bay Area and he was very complimentary about the book."
28:33;28:35;"He said, ""If you're ever down here, let's get together."""
28:35;28:40;"I wonder if Arch West ever had a moment of like, ""What did I unleash, Dr. Frankenstein?"""
28:40;28:42;"You know, I wonder that too."
28:42;28:48;"I mean because I think he died in the '90s and certainly by then, Doritos were massive."
28:48;28:51;"But by the time they came out with Cool Ranch, that was in the early '80s,"
28:51;28:53;"he was way out of the picture."
28:53;28:59;"He was the Robert Oppenheimer of tortilla chips."
28:59;29:06;"As he first tasted the taco-flavored Dorito chip, a line from the Vedic scripture came to mind."
29:06;29:11;"""Now I am become Death, destroyer of worlds."""
29:11;29:14;"He should have strangled his monster in his crib."
29:14;29:16;"This is a very interesting way to look at things."
29:16;29:18;"We talk a lot about Doritos, but we've never quite had this angle."
29:18;29:21;"So thank you so much, Mark, and everybody, check out the book, The Dorito Effect,"
29:21;29:24;"The Surprising Truth About Food and Flavor."
29:24;29:26;"Mark, what's your favorite type of Doritos?"
29:26;29:29;"Probably the classic nacho cheese."
29:29;29:30;"Love it."
29:30;29:31;"I'm a traditionalist."
29:31;29:33;"All right, great, Mark. Thanks for calling in."
29:33;29:35;"Thanks for having me on. It's been fun."
29:35;29:36;"Have a good one, man."
29:36;29:37;"You too."
31:28;31:36;"Wow, that was a pretty good call, Jake. What do you think?"
31:36;31:37;"Very informative."
31:37;31:41;"Yeah, you know, as I think about it more, I really think there's something to this."
31:41;31:50;"Like, we really do beat ourselves up for wanting to eat, you know, like, gas station food."
31:50;31:53;"But we should probably look at it, like, slightly differently."
31:53;31:59;"You're not a bad person if Twinkies and spicy nacho Doritos catch your eye."
31:59;32:01;"You're just a human being."
32:01;32:07;"If you can figure out a way to surround yourself with more healthful, tasty food options, you know,"
32:07;32:09;"you might not be worrying about it that much."
32:09;32:10;"Yeah."
32:10;32:14;"I felt pretty bad after when I ate that McFlurry at the Roger Waters concert."
32:14;32:17;"Yeah, and that hot dog I had last night was..."
32:17;32:19;"[laughs]"
32:19;32:21;"I felt weird."
32:21;32:24;"Yeah, that food does make you feel bad, but you know what it's like?"
32:24;32:28;"It's like with hot dogs, it's like, it's not like when you go to Staples Center or something,"
32:28;32:33;"they're like, we have like a super organic, like, sausage option."
32:33;32:34;"Right."
32:34;32:36;"It's like, you can force-feed this food."
32:36;32:39;"I'm surprised there's not like a taco stand or something."
32:39;32:41;"Yeah, at least it wasn't open."
32:41;32:44;"There was that Tostitos branded nacho station."
32:44;32:45;"Oh, yeah, it sucked."
32:45;32:47;"Remember those nachos that Ariel got?"
32:47;32:48;"Yeah, those nachos were terrible."
32:48;32:50;"This is how bad it is at the Staples Center."
32:50;32:55;"This is where people are paying like hundreds of dollars to see Roger Waters perform"
32:55;32:58;"the not-so-tasteful stylings of Pink Floyd."
32:58;33:03;"So people are in there like spending crazy money to watch this like cutting-edge laser light show."
33:03;33:04;"Yeah."
33:04;33:09;"And then you walk out, you want to get some nachos, and they hand you this like $10 thing"
33:09;33:14;"that's like just a bunch of plain Tostitos, a little cheese, and a little pile of jalapenos."
33:14;33:15;"Yeah."
33:15;33:22;"It's like they reduced what could be a great snack to like three whack component parts."
33:22;33:24;"Step it up, Staples Center."
33:24;33:25;"Despicable."
36:06;36:10;"So you know, Jake, we don't want to talk too much about the Roger Waters show."
36:10;36:11;"Yeah."
36:11;36:16;"It did spark an interesting dialogue we had via text about how much is Roger pulling in"
36:16;36:18;"on this gigantic tour."
36:18;36:20;"73-year-old man."
36:20;36:21;"Right."
36:21;36:23;"Going out on the road for two years."
36:23;36:24;"That is so deep."
36:24;36:26;"And he's putting money into the show."
36:26;36:29;"And we were kind of thinking like, you know, one level why."
36:29;36:31;"Seems like he wants to reclaim the legacy of Pink Floyd."
36:31;36:35;"But you know, this is like, you know, he's out there just doing a big swing kind of thing."
36:35;36:36;"Like is it for the money?"
36:36;36:37;"What's it for?"
36:37;36:42;"And that kind of led to a discussion about the highest grossing concert tours of all time."
36:42;36:45;"And there's a list on Wikipedia, which is very fascinating."
36:45;36:51;"Yeah, this was a post-concert, everyone's back home text conversation."
36:51;36:54;"Left us thinking how much money does Roger Waters make?"
36:54;36:56;"So I was surprised by this."
36:56;37:01;"The highest grossing concert of all time is U2."
37:01;37:07;"And one might think that the highest grossing concert of all time by U2 might be, you know,"
37:07;37:10;"when they're touring Joshua Tree or like something really big."
37:10;37:16;"But actually, all the highest grossing concerts tend to be by heritage artists a little bit"
37:16;37:17;"later in their career."
37:17;37:24;"So the biggest, highest grossing concert of all time is the U2 360 tour that took place in 2009."
37:24;37:25;"How much?"
37:25;37:32;"The actual gross in 2009 was $736 million."
37:32;37:33;"Wow."
37:33;37:35;"And they played 110 shows."
37:35;37:38;"So that's an average gross of $6.7 million."
37:38;37:40;"How did they get that many people to come out?"
37:40;37:46;"I mean, I know U2 is a big band, but like, just picture like 2009, U2 is just like every"
37:46;37:47;"city they're going to."
37:47;37:49;"They're like filling a football stadium."
37:49;37:52;"Yeah, like they're playing like Phoenix, Arizona."
37:52;37:54;"Playing to like 45."
37:54;37:55;"No, more."
37:55;37:56;"Well, the average."
37:56;37:57;"80,000?"
37:57;38:00;"I mean, the average attendance on this tour was 66,000."
38:00;38:01;"Wow."
38:01;38:06;"So they're not even talking about playing the Taco Bell Arena in Boise."
38:06;38:07;"They're not playing Boise."
38:07;38:11;"They're going Seattle, maybe Salt Lake City."
38:11;38:13;"They're just doing all NFL stadiums, I guess."
38:13;38:14;"Yeah."
38:14;38:20;"You know what caught my eye on that list was Bon Jovi 2013."
38:20;38:24;"They grossed $260 million on their tour."
38:24;38:31;"The name of the tour was Because We Can, which is the worst tour title ever."
38:31;38:32;"Yeah, because I think."
38:32;38:34;"It's like there's no new record."
38:34;38:35;"Right."
38:35;38:37;"They haven't had a hit in 20 years or whatever."
38:37;38:40;"And it's like, because we can."
38:40;38:44;"That's the 19th highest grossing tour of all time."
38:44;38:47;"You know, it's like, I guess there's no huge surprises."
38:47;38:49;"These are the top five highest grossing tours of all time."
38:49;38:50;"Number one, as we said, YouTube."
38:50;38:52;"Number two, The Rolling Stones in 2005."
38:52;38:57;"Number three, Roger Waters in 2010 doing The Wall Live."
38:57;38:59;"This guy just can't keep off the road."
38:59;39:01;"Yeah."
39:01;39:02;"Road dog."
39:02;39:03;"He's a real road dog."
39:03;39:05;"Number four, AC/DC."
39:05;39:06;"Huh."
39:06;39:07;"What year?"
39:07;39:08;"2008."
39:08;39:10;"Oh, yeah."
39:10;39:14;"So even Inflation Adjusted, bands made money in the '80s."
39:14;39:18;"But maybe they weren't charging the $1,500 VIP."
39:18;39:19;"Right."
39:19;39:27;"Because Def Leppard tours on Hysteria for three years from '87 to '90 or whatever."
39:27;39:28;"And it's like."
39:28;39:30;"They weren't taking in that kind of money back then."
39:42;39:43;"Madonna."
40:07;40:08;"First woman on the list."
40:08;40:09;"What year?"
40:09;40:17;"In 2008 to 2009, she did the Sticky and Sweet Tour where she grossed $408 million."
40:17;40:19;"The Police Reunion Tour, 2007 to 2008."
40:19;40:21;"I vaguely remember that happening."
40:21;40:22;"God, that's brutal."
40:22;40:23;"I just remember being like, ""Oh, yeah."
40:23;40:25;"The police are playing in Madison Square Garden or something."""
40:25;40:27;"I was like, ""Okay."""
40:27;40:30;"I didn't realize it was such a big deal."
40:30;40:36;"They played 156 shows and grossed $362 million."
40:36;40:37;"Wow."
40:37;40:40;"Can you imagine those 156 shows?"
40:40;40:41;"Well, especially like those guys hate each other, right?"
40:41;40:42;"Yeah."
40:42;40:43;"Can you imagine?"
40:43;40:45;"Just like Sting not saying a word."
40:45;40:47;"Yeah, just like month eight."
40:47;40:48;"""Hey, Sting, man."
40:48;40:51;"When was the last time you were in Cleveland?"""
40:51;40:52;"Shut the f--- up, Stewart."
41:05;41:11;"I've never been on a giant tour like that, but I've definitely been on tours and played some huge shows."
41:11;41:13;"Yeah, we played some big shows."
41:13;41:19;"I remember once we did a tour that was kind of playing small arenas in the UK."
41:19;41:21;"Vampire Weekend is not really an arena band."
41:21;41:32;"In the occasional city, we've done an arena, but our music definitely, I think, lends itself most to a kind of amphitheater in summertime."
41:32;41:33;"I feel that."
41:33;41:34;"But whatever."
41:34;41:37;"We played Barclays Center in New York, and we played at some of these small arenas in the UK."
41:37;41:40;"So that was the closest taste I ever had to an arena tour."
41:40;41:49;"And one thing about when you're starting out touring and you're jumping in the van, you're driving through wherever you are, you're taking in the scenery, you get to
the venue."
41:49;41:54;"There's generally going to be something idiosyncratic about that venue in that city."
41:54;41:58;"If you're playing really small places, it might be like, ""Whoa."""
41:58;42:03;"The place in Kansas City, they give you a token for half off a burrito, and you remember that, and it's cool."
42:03;42:09;"And then in this place, it's like, ""Whoa, it's actually this place where it's half inside, half..."""
42:09;42:11;"Yeah, whatever. There's little things about it."
42:11;42:19;"When you're doing these arenas, it's very easy to get into this Groundhog's Day vibe because all arenas are essentially the same."
42:19;42:21;"It's like a big loading dock."
42:21;42:22;"It's a big loading dock."
42:22;42:25;"You're not in the center of the city, nine times out of ten."
42:25;42:27;"You're out in the hinterlands."
42:27;42:33;"It's not like when you're playing downtown Missoula, Montana. You can walk out the back of the theater and check out the town."
42:33;42:34;"You can't walk anywhere."
42:34;42:42;"Yeah, it's just freeways connecting. There's a Bed, Bath & Beyond a quarter mile away. You can kind of see."
42:42;42:51;"Oh, man. I got so many memories of just waking up at 2 p.m. on the bus because I couldn't sleep."
42:51;42:55;"A lot of times that happens, I can't sleep on the bus, and I fall asleep at 7 a.m."
42:55;42:56;"Oh, man."
42:56;43:01;"You wake up at 2, stumble out in this dark bus, and then you open the door."
43:01;43:09;"Just bright Tucson sunlight pouring down."
43:09;43:12;"My hair is all messy, and I'm just like, ""Oh."""
43:12;43:20;"I walk across the asphalt up the loading dock into the venue and just be like, ""Oh, where are the catering?"""
43:20;43:21;"Oh, my God."
43:21;43:23;"""Let's go get a cup of coffee."""
43:23;43:25;"Grind the road, man."
43:25;43:27;"I'm not looking forward to that aspect of getting back on the road."
43:27;43:30;"Although when we were at the show, I was kind of like, ""You know what?"""
43:30;43:35;"And also working on the record so much now, I am starting to be like, ""Think more."""
43:35;43:41;"This is the first album where I've ever been working on an album and been kind of like working on a song and be like, ""Oh, this one's going to be fun live."""
43:41;43:42;"Oh, that's cool."
43:42;43:49;"Yeah, I've been getting kind of excited about not touring per se, but making the live show cool."
43:49;43:53;"That'll be fun. You got to come throw down some tasty licks on tour, Jake."
43:53;43:54;"Would love to."
43:54;43:57;"Actually, Jake and I, people might not know our backstory."
43:57;43:58;"Yeah."
43:58;44:04;"Loyal Time Crisis listeners maybe don't know how Jake and I actually met, which was on a tour."
44:04;44:05;"Yeah."
44:05;44:06;"Dirty Projectors."
44:07;44:09;"Getty Address Tour."
44:09;44:10;"2005?"
44:10;44:12;"Yep, 2005."
44:12;44:13;"2005."
44:13;44:15;"Double minivan assault."
44:15;44:18;"Same year as the Rolling Stones' Bigger Bang Tour."
44:18;44:30;"You know what's funny? If someone was like, in 2005, was like, ""Okay, in 12 years, you guys are going to be doing a bi-weekly radio show."""
44:30;44:32;"On the internet."
44:32;44:37;"Talking mostly about fast food, classic rock. I would have been like, ""Okay, that sounds about right."""
44:37;44:46;"Yeah, I guess if somebody had told us when we just first met on this Dirty Projectors tour, touring in minivans, playing punk houses and DIY venues."
44:46;44:47;"Yeah."
44:47;44:49;"""You guys are going to have a bi-weekly radio show."""
44:49;44:51;"I guess I probably would have been like..."
44:51;44:53;"Based in LA."
44:53;44:56;"Based in LA. That would have been a shocker. That part would have been funny."
44:56;44:59;"That's when I would have been like, ""Now I'm very curious."""
44:59;45:02;"When we first met, there was no Vampire Weekend."
45:02;45:03;"Yeah?"
45:03;45:04;"Not yet."
45:04;45:10;"Yeah, I remember you sending me, like, emailing me some demos of like, Oxford comma."
45:10;45:14;"And like, me listening to it on my laptop speakers being like, ""This is pretty good."""
45:14;45:17;"And then I remember you were like, because I was living in San Francisco then, and you were like,"
45:17;45:22;"""Oh dude, we're going to come out this summer, like, hook us up with like a backyard show."""
45:22;45:25;"Or like, put us on a bill with like, some cool band."
45:25;45:28;"And I was like, ""Yeah, I could swing that."""
45:28;45:31;"And then like a few months later you were like, ""We got it covered, dude."""
45:31;45:35;"That was crazy."
45:35;45:37;"Yeah, I remember that first tour."
48:42;48:47;"Okay, Jake, it's time to talk to Kenny Tulecki, a loyal Time Crisis listener who wrote in"
48:47;48:53;"and said that we could talk to them about what teens are listening to."
48:53;48:58;"Well, yeah, I remember Kenny said that the show lacked valid youth viewpoints."
48:58;49:00;"Fair enough."
49:00;49:01;"Because I know I'm on here a lot."
49:01;49:08;"A classic Time Crisis trope is me saying to Jake, you know, that the youth of America"
49:08;49:11;"don't appreciate the tasteful palate of 70s rock."
49:11;49:13;"But maybe I'm wrong."
49:13;49:14;"Maybe they're not all just listening to Chain Smokers."
49:14;49:16;"So Kenny's going to drop some knowledge on us now."
49:16;49:18;"How old is Kenny?"
49:18;49:20;"Not sure. We'll find out."
49:20;49:23;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
49:23;49:27;"[Phone ringing]"
49:27;49:28;"Yo, homie."
49:28;49:30;"Kenny, what's up?"
49:30;49:32;"What's up, my guys?"
49:32;49:35;"We're just here recording Time Crisis."
49:35;49:38;"We really appreciate you calling in."
49:38;49:40;"So where are you calling from, Kenny?"
49:40;49:42;"Costa Mesa, California."
49:42;49:44;"How old are you, Kenny, and what grade are you in?"
49:44;49:47;"14 and a half, going into ninth grade."
49:47;49:49;"So is that fair to say you're officially a high school student now?"
49:49;49:50;"Nope."
49:50;49:52;"No, not yet?"
49:52;49:53;"I'm not in high school."
49:53;49:54;"Oh, you're a middle school student."
49:54;49:56;"You're finishing eighth grade."
49:56;50:00;"I finished eighth grade, and I didn't go to graduation."
50:00;50:01;"Okay, got it."
50:01;50:05;"All right, so, Kenny, you just finished eighth grade."
50:05;50:08;"You said the Time Crisis is missing a youth viewpoint."
50:08;50:09;"We agree."
50:09;50:12;"So we want to talk to you about what the youth of America are listening to,"
50:12;50:15;"because I always tell Jake that it's mostly chain smokers,"
50:15;50:20;"and nobody appreciates the tasteful palate of Guided By Voices or the Eagles."
50:20;50:22;"But is that not true?"
50:22;50:24;"I love Guided By Voices."
50:24;50:28;"Okay, so that's interesting, because, you know, sometimes we're a little harsh on Jake."
50:28;50:31;"We tell him nobody cares about Guided By Voices anymore, which is his favorite band."
50:31;50:36;"But that's encouraging to hear that somebody your age cares about GBV."
50:36;50:38;"But are you in the minority at your school?"
50:38;50:41;"Not even my parents know who Guided By Voices are."
50:41;50:44;"No one knows who Guided By Voices are, but Jake talked about them,"
50:44;50:46;"and I trust that guy, so I listen to them."
50:46;50:48;"Respect."
50:48;50:52;"So, Kenny, you picked a few songs for us to play."
50:52;50:53;"Can you walk us through them?"
50:53;50:56;"This is a taste of three songs that you think are cool."
50:56;51:03;"All right, can I start out with ""Pass the Eulogy"" by Sophia Nance?"
51:03;51:05;"Sure."
51:05;51:07;"So who's Sophia Nance? I don't think I'm familiar."
51:07;51:12;"Sophia Nance is a very big Vampire Weekend fan."
51:12;51:17;"She really likes you guys, and she has been trying to get you on Twitter"
51:17;51:22;"to listen to her new album that she made when she was, like, 16 or 17."
51:22;51:29;"And I feel like you guys should listen to it because she pays such high respect towards you."
51:29;51:30;"Is she local?"
51:30;51:32;"She's in Texas."
51:32;51:34;"Okay, okay, nice."
51:34;51:36;"[singing]"
51:36;51:41;"Universe and white scars"
51:41;51:48;"[piano]"
51:48;51:56;"Don't tell me you yourself are confused"
51:56;52:04;"When I tell you you yourself are my years"
52:04;52:12;"They say there are seven but you make the eighth wonders of the world"
52:12;52:25;"They say there's a heaven and I'm sure the gates open at the sight of your known face"
52:25;52:28;"Oh"
52:28;52:37;"I'm not gonna sing about the stars I think you heard them all"
52:37;52:42;"I'm gonna sing about the earth, the walls, and how it's dark"
52:42;52:48;"And being cool by nightfall"
52:48;52:55;"By nightfall"
52:55;52:58;"Okay, Sophia Nance. Very vibey."
52:58;53:00;"So how do you know Sophia Nance's music?"
53:00;53:03;"Because we've been friends for, like, two years on the internet."
53:03;53:07;"Like, I know all the, like, Vampire Weekend heads."
53:07;53:11;"Interesting. I haven't been on Twitter much lately, so I haven't seen any of her tweets."
53:11;53:16;"So there's a community of Vampire Weekend heads that talk to each other."
53:16;53:17;"Yeah."
53:17;53:31;"[piano]"
53:31;53:33;"Okay, what's the next song that you picked?"
53:33;53:36;"Heat by Brockhampton."
53:36;53:38;"Cool, let's check it out. Oh, I've heard of Brockhampton."
53:38;53:43;"Yeah, they're, like, they just released an album, and this is, like, my favorite song off of that."
53:43;53:46;"And it's, like, super loud."
53:46;53:47;"Okay."
53:47;53:50;"I got pipe dreams of crack rocks and stripper poles"
53:50;53:52;"Of the Oaks and the Falls"
53:52;53:55;"So I got secrets only me and all my niggas know"
53:55;53:58;"A kickin' in the doors, I send a piss in the kitchen"
53:58;54:02;"So don't play the Oaks, you stupid, I know you got the product"
54:02;54:06;"'Cause I can smell the money, I can taste the weed"
54:06;54:09;"Give me something more, buy the only way I leave"
54:09;54:12;"I love to watch 'em squirm, I love when bitches bleed"
54:12;54:15;"And she's suckin' on the barrel, you can't hear her scream"
54:15;54:18;"So kiss the f-- on carpet, disaggravate and larsen"
54:18;54:21;"And then I'm out the door, it's monsters in your home"
54:21;54:24;"Black gloves, mask on, muzzle plated chrome"
54:24;54:26;"Who they callin' cops on my chicken?"
54:28;54:31;"That's the first one to go, the first shot I blow"
54:31;54:34;"Who they callin' cops on my chicken?"
54:34;54:36;"Who they callin' cops on my chicken?"
54:36;54:40;"Santa, Santa, who be the number one Santa?"
54:40;54:43;"Put the mist on you when I'm on your blocker"
54:43;54:46;"And no be thin, no be itchy when I'm off it"
54:46;54:50;"Off it, I'm off it, I got the magazine from the pistol"
54:50;54:53;"For any politics and target games, even issue"
54:53;54:56;"Another black man in the street, it's official"
54:56;54:59;"We ridin' out the spray, we goin' on the pistol"
54:59;55:03;"Huh, they come get another cup"
55:03;55:07;"Huh, come in on my block for the answer"
55:07;55:10;"Huh, I don't get time for your question"
55:10;55:13;"Huh, this put me mummy in the fridge"
55:13;55:16;"I hate the way I think, I hate the way it looms"
55:16;55:19;"I hate the way the things I say incinerate a room"
55:19;55:22;"I know I'm tryin' to change, but it don't ever work"
55:22;55:25;"Just end up more broken down than when I started"
55:25;55:28;"And that concrete feels the hardest every time I seem to touch it"
55:28;55:31;"Started thinkin' I ain't meant for life"
55:31;55:33;"But that's too deep, fallin' up into the ceiling"
55:33;55:36;"While I'm drownin' in the creek of my emotions"
55:36;55:39;"Tryin' harder to be open, talkin' 'bout release dates"
55:39;55:41;"I'm tryin' to make it to tomorrow"
55:41;55:44;"Internal honesty could be the hardest pill to swallow"
55:44;55:47;"So I need two shots at everything that's on the pre-open"
55:47;55:50;"I'm dacin' with myself, settin' fire to the venue, mom"
55:50;55:52;"Go call the cops on my dickin'"
55:52;55:57;"Because I am aggressive, and it's a good song"
55:57;56:01;"And it's like a way to let my aggression out"
56:01;56:03;"Okay, what's the last song you picked?"
56:03;56:08;"New Flesh by Current Joys, also known as Televisions"
56:08;56:10;"But for some reason they changed their name"
56:10;56:11;"Cool"
56:11;56:13;"There was a band called Television"
56:13;56:15;"Yeah, maybe they felt like it was too close"
56:15;56:17;"The band was called Televisions?"
56:17;56:20;"Yes, with like a dash in the middle of it"
56:20;56:21;"Sounds cool"
56:21;56:24;"Yeah, Nicholas Gratigan is the person that made it"
56:24;56:26;"And he's really good"
56:26;56:28;"Where's this band from?"
56:28;56:29;"Uh, New York"
56:29;56:31;"How'd you find this?"
56:31;56:35;"Uh, well, it's a really sad story actually"
56:35;56:38;"Um, this girl that was a viner"
56:38;56:41;"Uh, this was the song in her last vine"
56:41;56:43;"Before she passed away from cancer"
56:43;56:44;"Oh man"
56:44;56:46;"In early 2016"
56:46;56:47;"Oh man, that's a sad story"
56:47;56:48;"Yeah"

58:04;58:05;"Is that fair to say?"
58:05;58:09;"I guess, I listen to a lot of different stuff though"
58:09;58:13;"And at your school, are there a lot of Chainsmokers fans?"
58:13;58:14;"What's the climate?"
58:14;58:18;"Uh, the dumbasses at my school don't know what they're talking about"
58:18;58:20;"So they really just like, don't get it"
58:20;58:22;"And they listen to whatever's on the radio"
58:22;58:25;"Like, even if it's a really crappy song"
58:25;58:28;"They're like, ""Oh, that's really toppin' it"""

58:31;58:33;"I guess some things never change"
58:33;58:35;"I think that's how..."
58:35;58:39;"I think that's the classic dichotomy, always"
58:39;58:40;"In middle school and high school"
58:40;58:42;"Like, some people are interested in independent music"
58:42;58:46;"And they don't understand what the other people are seeing in the radio music"
58:46;58:47;"And vice versa"
58:47;58:49;"Sounds like an episode of Freaks and Geeks"
58:49;58:50;"More or less"
58:50;58:51;"I mean, yeah"
58:51;58:54;"So that's a yes, there's a lot of Chainsmokers fans"
58:54;58:56;"They're not fans, but they like..."
58:56;58:57;"Okay, I understand what you're saying"
58:57;59:01;"They don't listen to anything except for what's on the radio"
59:01;59:04;"Now, as a new Guided by Voices fan"
59:04;59:08;"Have you tried turning on any of the kids in your school to GBV?"
59:08;59:09;"I don't talk to any of them"
59:09;59:11;"I try to stay away from them"
59:11;59:12;"Fair enough"
59:12;59:13;"Do you talk music with anyone?"
59:13;59:15;"Like, maybe friends on the internet?"
59:15;59:18;"My friend Jackie on the internet"
59:18;59:21;"My friend Jackie is into the same music as me"
59:21;59:22;"Cool"
59:22;59:29;"Has getting into Guided by Voices gotten you interested in any other '90s indie rock?"
59:29;59:32;"Well, you said that you like Fugazi"
59:32;59:34;"So I started listening to Fugazi"
59:34;59:35;"Oh, tight"
59:35;59:36;"What do you think of them?"
59:36;59:37;"They're dope"
59:37;59:41;"Yeah, that Fugazi spirit is definitely lacking in modern music"
59:41;59:45;"So, Kenny, I remember when I was around your age"
59:45;59:48;"I also felt pretty alienated from mainstream music or radio music"
59:48;59:53;"But is there anything in the mainstream radio music that speaks to you?"
59:53;59:56;"Clearly most of it doesn't, which is totally understandable"
59:56;01:00:01;"But is there anything that kind of crosses over where you find maybe common ground?"
01:00:01;01:00:07;"Yeah, the songs that famous people do with Frank Ocean"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"Frank Ocean is amazing"
01:00:09;01:00:10;"I love Frank Ocean"
01:00:10;01:00:14;"So whenever they collaborate with him, that's pretty dope"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"And The Weeknd's good, too"
01:00:16;01:00:21;"And I like some random songs just randomly on the radio"
01:00:21;01:00:25;"I listen to the radio a lot, so I just know a lot of music"
01:00:25;01:00:28;"Right, so you take it all in, you don't love all of it"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"Yeah, I like The Weeknd, too"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"Of all the stuff we listen to on Time Crisis"
01:00:32;01:00:35;"And when I'm just somewhere and they're just kind of playing pop radio"
01:00:35;01:00:39;"When I Feel It Coming comes on, that's a good one"
01:00:39;01:00:40;"How about Bieber?"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"Everyone likes Bieber"
01:00:42;01:00:46;"Everyone at my school last year heavily messed with Bieber"
01:00:46;01:00:50;"But, I don't know, he seems like he's doing his own thing"
01:00:50;01:00:53;"And I don't really want to mess with that"
01:00:53;01:00:57;"But I'll listen to a few of his songs occasionally"
01:00:57;01:00:58;"I don't mess with Diplo, though"
01:00:58;01:01:01;"Are you willing to listen to a Bieber song produced by Diplo?"
01:01:01;01:01:05;"Possibly, probably not, though, because I don't like rats"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"Fair enough"
01:01:06;01:01:07;"Rats?"
01:01:07;01:01:09;"Diplo looks like a rat"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"Oh, okay, I thought you meant he ratted someone out"
01:01:11;01:01:14;"Oh, he probably did, you know him"
01:01:14;01:01:15;"I don't"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"You told the feds"
01:01:17;01:01:18;"I don't know him"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"Well, good for you, then"
01:01:20;01:01:24;"Kenny, thanks so much for picking these songs, we really appreciate it"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Can you please come to my birthday party?"
01:01:28;01:01:32;"I know that's stupid, but Jason told me that he was going to ask for me"
01:01:32;01:01:35;"So he told me that I had to ask myself"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"Oh, well, probably not"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"I'm in the studio every single day, but when's your birthday?"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"Shut up, no you are not"
01:01:41;01:01:42;"Saturday"
01:01:42;01:01:45;"Saturday, it's like a half birthday party"
01:01:45;01:01:48;"Because I wanted to throw a party"
01:01:48;01:01:49;"Oh, fair enough"
01:01:49;01:01:53;"Even if Jake comes with his dog, because I like his dog"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"Marty is pretty awesome"
01:01:55;01:01:56;"Yeah, Marty is dope"
01:01:56;01:01:58;"Marty is a great dog"
01:01:58;01:02:01;"I love the feed of Marty on Instagram"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"Marty is a very cute dog"
01:02:03;01:02:05;"Kenny, what do you have to do this summer?"
01:02:05;01:02:10;"Literally nothing, because I hate everyone and it's hard to do anything"
01:02:10;01:02:14;"But I'm just chilling out in Southern California for the entire summer"
01:02:14;01:02:17;"Probably just listening to new albums and stuff"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"That doesn't sound half bad"
01:02:19;01:02:20;"Yeah, it's really chill"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"Chilling in SoCal listening to new music"
01:02:22;01:02:23;"Yeah, it's great"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"You just got to do to chill out"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"That's what summer is all about"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"Especially as you're getting ready for high school"
01:02:29;01:02:30;"Yep"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"Alright, well, Kenny, thanks so much for picking these songs"
01:02:32;01:02:36;"We really appreciate you bringing a youthful viewpoint to Time Crisis"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"And especially spotlighting some newer music"
01:02:38;01:02:42;"Because I know we go on and on about the tasteful palette of 70s rock"
01:02:42;01:02:46;"So thanks for playing this music by Brockhampton, Sofianance, and CurrentJoyce"
01:02:46;01:02:47;"Thank you for having me"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"Our pleasure, we'll talk to you soon, Kenny"
01:02:49;01:02:50;"Take care"
01:02:50;01:02:51;"Talk to you soon, bye"
01:02:51;01:03:01;"Call me, call me, call me"
01:03:01;01:03:04;"How you doing?"
01:03:04;01:03:07;"My name is Tony, nice to meet you"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"Here's my number"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"You can reach me"
01:03:11;01:03:15;"911, call me"
01:03:15;01:03:17;"Call me sometime"
01:03:17;01:03:20;"911, call me"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"Call me sometime"
01:03:22;01:03:26;"Call me"
01:03:26;01:03:31;"Call me"
01:03:31;01:03:33;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
01:03:33;01:03:35;"My thirst levels are infinity and beyond"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"Sipping on that Le Mans"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"Ayy, I need a Beyonce"
01:03:38;01:03:41;"Can't see straight, these shades of Celine Dion"
01:03:41;01:03:44;"Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon Musk"
01:03:44;01:03:46;"Yeah, I got a sold out show"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"Crawl all out, but don't matter 'cause you down front row"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"I've been looking for a key, uh"
01:03:50;01:03:53;"Listen to the speaker, if you fit the script, yeah"
01:03:53;01:03:55;"Hit me on my beat, buy that 911"
01:03:55;01:03:58;"Call me sometime"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"Ring, ring, ring, ring"
01:04:00;01:04:03;"Please, bank my line"
01:04:03;01:04:05;"You know I'll answer"
01:04:05;01:04:08;"But call me sometime"
01:04:08;01:04:11;"Ring, ring, ring, ring"
01:04:11;01:04:15;"Please, bank my line"
01:04:15;01:04:19;"911, call me"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"Call me sometime"
01:04:21;01:04:24;"911, call me"
01:04:24;01:04:26;"Call me sometime"
01:04:26;01:04:30;"Call me"
01:04:30;01:04:35;"911, call me"
01:04:35;01:04:39;"Charm, charm"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"Charm, charm"
01:04:42;01:04:45;"Woke up in the Burbs, Burbs, with the Burbs, Burbs"
01:04:45;01:04:48;"Boy, you used to come and get me with the Swerves, Swerves"
01:04:48;01:04:51;"These days, you gotta find time"
01:04:51;01:04:54;"Even the night, ride"
01:04:54;01:04:57;"Work, mind"
01:04:57;01:04:59;"Without night"
01:04:59;01:05:02;"5 car garage"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"Full tank of the gas"
01:05:04;01:05:07;"But that don't mean nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing"
01:05:07;01:05:10;"Without you, shotgun and the passenger"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"I'm the loneliest man alive"
01:05:12;01:05:15;"But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can groove to the blues"
01:05:17;01:05:20;"If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 9"
01:05:20;01:05:23;"1, 1"
01:05:23;01:05:27;"I can't even lie, I've been lonely"
01:05:27;01:05:29;"Oh, lonely ass"
01:05:29;01:05:31;"I can't even lie, I've been lonely"
01:05:33;01:05:35;"Weird ass"
01:05:35;01:05:38;"I can't even lie, I've been lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely"
01:05:38;01:05:40;"They say the loudest in the room is weak, that's what they assume"
01:05:40;01:05:44;"But I disagree, I say the loudest in the room is probably the loneliest one in the room"
01:05:44;01:05:48;"Attention seeker, public speaker, oh my God, that boy there so lonely"
01:05:48;01:05:51;"Write songs about these people who do not exist, he's such a c*nt phone"
01:05:51;01:05:54;"And one thing I know is that I want 'em to win so bad, but I'm not Chicago"
01:05:54;01:05:57;"I'm hard as low as real low, it's so low, you can't lift me up, I'm like a lotto"
01:05:57;01:06:01;"From the start, it's been real dark, it's been so dark, I guess that you could call it charboard"
01:06:01;01:06:04;"I'm playin' like Hasbro, I'm really sorry, call me Alto"
01:06:04;01:06:07;"Crash the McLaren, bought me a Tesla, I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars"
01:06:07;01:06:10;"But what the f*ck else do you want from me, that is the only thing keepin' me company"
01:06:10;01:06:13;"Purchase some banks 'til I'm a Nord, these items is fillin' a vault"
01:06:13;01:06:17;"Been feelin' it for so long, I don't even know if it's what I enjoy"
01:06:17;01:06:21;"Current backdoor, how's the net dough? My partner is a shadow, I need love"
01:06:21;01:06:24;"Do you got some on your palm? I can find some in the mall, bro"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"But that never comes, like a vasectomy, what have I done?"
01:06:26;01:06:30;"I got the talent to face enough funds for myself, I'ma go, but I haven't found some"
01:06:30;01:06:33;"One, mirror, mirror on the wall, the loneliest of 'em all"
01:06:33;01:06:36;"Me, cute but actin' stupid, do you got another number I could call?"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"Never had a pet, I never had a pet"
01:06:39;01:06:42;"There's more fish in the sea, but I never had a goldfish to begin with"
01:06:42;01:06:45;"I never had a dog, so I never been through a"
01:06:45;01:06:47;"'Cause I never threw a ball, bitch"
01:06:47;01:06:50;"I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet"
01:06:50;01:06:53;"Treat me like Director Pozner, checkin' on me some time"
01:06:53;01:06:59;"Ask me how I'm really doin', so I never have to press that 9-1-1"
01:06:59;01:07:01;"Kenny from Costa Mesa callin' in"
01:07:01;01:07:05;"Droppin' some real heat on us, three songs"
01:07:05;01:07:07;"Bringin' some youthful perspective to time crisis"
01:07:07;01:07:13;"Jake, do you remember the summer between 8th grade and 9th grade for you?"
01:07:13;01:07:16;"Uh, vaguely"
01:07:16;01:07:17;"Nothing stands out?"
01:07:17;01:07:21;"I think we took a family trip to Wyoming"
01:07:21;01:07:23;"What'd you do in Wyoming, like a camp?"
01:07:23;01:07:27;"Yeah, did some like horse riding on some trails"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"Uh-huh"
01:07:28;01:07:31;"I think I saved my brother's life that summer"
01:07:31;01:07:32;"Really?"
01:07:32;01:07:33;"Yeah, we were like"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"By introducing him to Guided By Voices?"
01:07:35;01:07:37;"I wasn't into GBV"
01:07:37;01:07:38;"Oh yeah"
01:07:38;01:07:43;"GBV was just grinding it out in the Dayton, Ohio basement at that point"
01:07:43;01:07:44;"In obscurity"
01:07:44;01:07:46;"How'd you save Dave's life?"
01:07:46;01:07:51;"We were fishing in a really like raging river"
01:07:51;01:07:52;"Ooh"
01:07:52;01:07:55;"And he, so I would've been"
01:07:55;01:07:58;"He had what, like 13? He would've been like 8"
01:07:58;01:07:59;"Okay"
01:07:59;01:08:02;"He fell down, he lost control"
01:08:02;01:08:07;"Like he was trying to like wade through this like really like intense current in this river and he fell"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"And he started just getting swept down"
01:08:09;01:08:10;"Oh my god"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"The river, and I just like bolted"
01:08:12;01:08:16;"I could just like run down the shoreline of the river really fast"
01:08:16;01:08:19;"And just like cut him off and just like went into the, that was much bigger"
01:08:19;01:08:22;"13 and 8, that's a huge"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"Right, so you're big enough that the current couldn't take you"
01:08:24;01:08:29;"Yeah, so I could just like plant in, I found like a spot where I could plant and I just like grabbed him"
01:08:29;01:08:31;"And like just like pulled him out of the river"
01:08:31;01:08:33;"Man, that's terrifying"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"I think that was that summer"
01:08:35;01:08:40;"Right, Jerry Garcia's father died in a kind of current situation"
01:08:40;01:08:41;"Whoa"
01:08:41;01:08:42;"Young Jerry was there"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"Really?"
01:08:43;01:08:44;"Yeah"
01:08:44;01:08:45;"How old was Jerry?"
01:08:45;01:08:46;"He was like a little kid, under 10"
01:08:46;01:08:47;"Jeez"
01:08:47;01:08:48;"Man, that's heavy"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"Wow, I didn't know you saved Dave's life"
01:08:50;01:08:53;"I mean it's slightly hyperbolic to put it that way"
01:08:53;01:08:54;"It could have gone"
01:08:54;01:08:55;"Rolling into high school"
01:08:55;01:08:56;"It could have gone south"
01:08:56;01:08:57;"Yeah, 8th grade, I remember I didn't"
01:08:57;01:08:58;"Do you remember that summer?"
01:08:58;01:08:59;"Yeah"
01:08:59;01:09:01;"I didn't like 8th, I remember I liked 7th grade"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"I didn't like 8th grade that much"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"8th grade we moved into the high school building"
01:09:05;01:09:06;"Okay"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"In my school system"
01:09:08;01:09:13;"So I just remember being in the high school building and like 8th grade was just kind of like a random bummer year"
01:09:13;01:09:16;"So the, before freshman, I can't even"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"It's a rough time"
01:09:18;01:09:22;"Kenny seemed to not be relishing it, which I understand"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"Very understandable"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"Hang in there, Kenny"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"Definitely hang in there, especially at that age, like"
01:09:28;01:09:31;"If you feel alienated from the kids at your school"
01:09:31;01:09:33;"I guess the internet's a positive development"
01:09:33;01:09:34;"Yeah"
01:09:34;01:09:37;"I only had like kind of AOL chat rooms"
01:09:37;01:09:39;"You weren't gonna make any"
01:09:39;01:09:42;"Weren't gonna establish too many significant relationships that way"
01:09:42;01:09:47;"But like, yeah, it's like when you're still growing up and like surrounded by, in a small atmosphere"
01:09:47;01:09:50;"If you feel alienated from everybody, that can be tough, but"
01:09:50;01:09:53;"So funny, like when I was in 8th grade, the internet did not exist"
01:09:53;01:09:54;"Full stop"
01:09:54;01:09:55;"It was"
01:09:55;01:09:56;"Like circa 1990"
01:09:56;01:09:57;"No, it existed"
01:09:57;01:09:58;"It existed"
01:09:58;01:10:00;"Well, not for public usage"
01:10:00;01:10:03;"Yeah, well, very few people had it at home"
01:10:03;01:10:04;"In 1990?"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"Yeah, some people had it at home"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Very few people"
01:10:08;01:10:09;"Okay"
01:10:09;01:10:10;"It wasn't, yeah, you're right, it wasn't"
01:10:10;01:10:13;"It was not in the like, the common kind of parlance"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"Yeah"
01:10:14;01:10:17;"I wanna say '95"
01:10:17;01:10:20;"I went to college in '95 and I feel like it was like"
01:10:20;01:10:22;"Oh, this is this new thing, like"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"Instead of long distance phone calls"
01:10:24;01:10:28;"That cost a lot of money, we can like write to each other"
01:10:28;01:10:29;"Right, start emailing"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"And that didn't happen"
01:10:31;01:10:34;"I mean, there were some like occasional emails, but like with my parents"
01:10:34;01:10:37;"I'm not gonna email my parents"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"I'm gonna use their calling card to call them"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"Yeah"
01:10:41;01:10:42;"But yeah, I think around then"
01:10:42;01:10:43;"Okay"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"It's officially summer"
01:10:45;01:10:47;"It's time for the top five"
01:10:47;01:10:50;"It's time for the top five"
01:10:50;01:10:54;"Five on iTunes"
01:10:54;01:10:58;"This week's edition of the top five is really a top ten"
01:10:58;01:11:02;"Because we're gonna look at the top ten songs right now"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"On the Billboard charts"
01:11:04;01:11:05;"Not the iTunes charts"
01:11:06;01:11:07;"We're going straight to Billboard"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"Because this is the first week of summer"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"So we wanna see what are the top ten songs"
01:11:11;01:11:14;"For the first week of summer 2017"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"So the number ten song this week"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"Body Like a Back Road"
01:11:18;01:11:19;"No, Body Like a Back Road"
01:11:19;01:11:21;"That was more of the song of the spring"
01:11:21;01:11:22;"Okay"
01:11:22;01:11:23;"This one's by Post Malone"
01:11:23;01:11:24;"Do you know who that is, Jake?"
01:11:24;01:11:25;"Carl Malone's son?"
01:11:25;01:11:28;"Well, the Malone is a reference to Carl Malone, I believe"
01:11:28;01:11:29;"And like Posting Up?"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"No, I think Post is his real last name"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"Whatever"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"Is he Utah based?"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"No, I think he's originally from Texas"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"And I think he's out in LA now"
01:11:38;01:11:41;"He had a big song called White Iverson"
01:11:41;01:11:42;"Kinda kicked things off for him"
01:11:42;01:11:43;"You remember that?"
01:11:43;01:11:44;"No"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"So he's just like a deep basketball dude"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"He's definitely a basketball fan"
01:11:48;01:11:49;"So he has this song"
01:11:49;01:11:51;"Kind of his second big single"
01:11:51;01:11:53;"It's called Congratulations featuring Quavo"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"Remember who Quavo is?"
01:11:55;01:11:56;"No"
01:11:56;01:11:59;"He's a rapper and he's in a rap group"
01:11:59;01:12:00;"Okay"
01:12:00;01:12:01;"Amigos?"
01:12:01;01:12:03;"Yeah, hey!"
01:12:03;01:12:04;"Not bad"
01:12:04;01:12:05;"Look at me"
01:12:05;01:12:07;"Okay, so the number ten song right now"
01:12:07;01:12:11;"Congratulations featuring Quavo, Post Malone"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"Body like a back road"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"Is this Percocet?"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"Percocet"
01:12:25;01:12:26;"No"
01:12:26;01:12:27;"No, that's Future"
01:12:51;01:12:53;"Kind of a Drake ripoff here"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"Drake riboff?"
01:12:56;01:12:57;"Yeah"
01:12:57;01:12:58;"Strong words, Jake"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"The melody is so similar"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"That melody is the exact same"
01:13:06;01:13:07;"As what? As a Drake song?"
01:13:07;01:13:08;"Yeah"
01:13:08;01:13:09;"Which one?"
01:13:09;01:13:11;"We'll come back around to it"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"That chorus?"
01:13:13;01:13:14;"You didn't recognize that?"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"Yeah, what is that?"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"Yeah, I guess Drake"
01:13:18;01:13:19;"It's just a"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"And that one is called Congratulations, right?"
01:13:26;01:13:27;"Or no, just the song?"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"It's not Highline Bling, is it?"
01:13:35;01:13:36;"Yeah"
01:13:45;01:13:46;"It's like the same"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"You know what? It's an interval"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"Drake doesn't own that interval"
01:13:51;01:13:52;"And it's"
01:14:01;01:14:02;"You come so"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"So Jake, obviously you identified"
01:14:04;01:14:05;"A very hot interval right now"
01:14:05;01:14:06;"Yep"
01:14:06;01:14:11;"Ever since I had congratulations"
01:14:11;01:14:14;"Ever since I left congratulations"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"It's a hot interval"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"Intervals come, intervals go"
01:14:18;01:14:19;"That's true"
01:14:19;01:14:20;"Post Malone"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"You know who first told me about Post Malone"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"Way before he was famous?"
01:14:24;01:14:25;"East Coast?"
01:14:25;01:14:26;"Time Crisis crew?"
01:14:26;01:14:28;"Exactly, Despot"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"He was talking about Post Malone like years ago"
01:14:30;01:14:31;"That was the first time I ever heard him"
01:14:31;01:14:33;"That single was platinum in America"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"It's a good name, Post Malone"
01:14:35;01:14:36;"Yeah, he's an interesting guy"
01:14:36;01:14:37;"I like him"
01:14:37;01:14:38;"Platinum, what does that mean?"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"It means it sold a million copies"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"Really?"
01:14:42;01:14:43;"I'm sure that probably includes streaming"
01:14:43;01:14:44;"But you know, it is what it is"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"So it sold 60,000 copies"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"And got streamed a billion times"
01:14:48;01:14:49;"[Laughter]"
01:14:49;01:14:50;"That's crazy"
01:14:50;01:14:51;"Somebody should figure out how much"
01:14:51;01:14:52;"Like back in the day"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"You know, to have a platinum single is a really big deal"
01:14:54;01:14:55;"I mean, it still is"
01:14:55;01:14:56;"I'm not saying it's easy"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"You have to really make a popular song"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"But I wonder if these days"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"If you go platinum off Spotify"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"Like what kind of check you're getting"
01:15:04;01:15:05;"I feel like we've talked about this before"
01:15:05;01:15:09;"Like a million streams on Spotify is like"
01:15:09;01:15:12;"What is it, like five grand or 50 grand?"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"You gotta split it with, I don't know"
01:15:14;01:15:15;"It's complicated"
01:15:15;01:15:16;"The number nine song"
01:15:16;01:15:19;"Lil Uzi Vert - XO Tour Life"
01:15:19;01:15:20;"Who is this?"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"Lil Uzi"
01:15:22;01:15:23;"He's a rapper"
01:15:23;01:15:24;"Okay"
01:15:24;01:15:25;"Lil"
01:15:25;01:15:28;"It's like Lil Abner but it's Lil Uzi"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"Yeah, or like Lil Wayne"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"Lil Abner"
01:15:32;01:15:33;"Who is Lil Abner?"
01:15:33;01:15:34;"I don't even know"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"It's like an old ass cartoon"
01:15:36;01:15:42;"This is a good song"
01:15:42;01:15:45;"Lil Uzi Vert - XO Tour Life"
01:15:45;01:16:09;"Kind of a dark song"
01:16:09;01:16:10;"Song of the summer"
01:16:10;01:16:12;"Yeah, just like barbecuing, cracking a brew"
01:16:12;01:16:15;"Hey, all my friends are dead"
01:16:15;01:16:17;"Push me to the edge"
01:16:17;01:16:19;"It says here that Lil Uzi Vert considers himself"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"To be more of a rock star than a rapper"
01:16:21;01:16:22;"Okay"
01:16:22;01:16:26;"I think Lil Uzi is a big Marilyn Manson fan actually"
01:16:26;01:16:27;"To take this whole circle"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"He got like a Marilyn Manson chain"
01:16:29;01:16:30;"It's pretty cool"
01:16:30;01:16:31;"What's that? What do you mean chain?"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"You know, he got like a"
01:16:33;01:16:36;"Like a chain, like a gold necklace with a medallion"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"Except the medallion is like a diamond"
01:16:38;01:16:40;"Encrusted Marilyn Manson"
01:16:40;01:16:42;"Face?"
01:16:42;01:16:43;"Yeah"
01:16:43;01:16:45;"Like Marilyn's face in diamonds?"
01:16:45;01:16:47;"Yeah"
01:16:47;01:16:48;"Wow"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"Marilyn Manson wearing Mickey Mouse ears"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"I wonder if they've hung out"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"Yeah, these days I would guess"
01:16:54;01:16:57;"Marilyn Manson, Los Angeles based performer"
01:16:57;01:16:58;"Yeah"
01:16:58;01:16:59;"As we know"
01:16:59;01:17:00;"Hitting the Roger Waters show"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"Yeah, like Lil Uzi's probably been in LA a million times"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"Cause he's blowing up right now"
01:17:04;01:17:05;"Sure"
01:17:05;01:17:06;"Certainly in this day and age"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"Marilyn Manson is hearing about"
01:17:08;01:17:11;"This like hot young rapper wearing a chain with his face on it"
01:17:11;01:17:13;"He's hearing about that like two seconds later"
01:17:13;01:17:14;"Yeah"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"People are like, his texts are blowing up"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"So yeah, I wonder if they've probably met"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"If Marilyn's down"
01:17:20;01:17:21;"They've probably met"
01:17:21;01:17:24;"Uzi, Marilyn, Roger Waters"
01:17:24;01:17:27;"It's a cool hang"
01:17:27;01:17:28;"He's kicking it"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"One thing I like about this song is"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"It was originally kind of like a SoundCloud song"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"Like something he just threw up on SoundCloud"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"And then it got so popular on SoundCloud"
01:18:16;01:18:19;"And like the label was like, we gotta release this officially"
01:18:19;01:18:22;"And it has this kind of unusual name"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"XO Tour Life"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"Cause you know, normally hit songs have"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"The title is like the, you know"
01:18:28;01:18:30;"Like Post Malone, ""Congratulations"""
01:18:30;01:18:32;"And the chorus goes, ""Congratulations"""
01:18:32;01:18:35;"And in this, the song's called XO Tour Life"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"And he says, ""The real hook has pushed me to the edge"
01:18:37;01:18:39;"All my friends are dead"""
01:18:39;01:18:40;"It's much cooler that the song is not called"
01:18:40;01:18:41;"""All My Friends Are Dead"""
01:18:41;01:18:43;"What's the song called?"
01:18:43;01:18:44;"XO Tour Life"
01:18:44;01:18:45;"X-O?"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"Yeah, with a kind of stylized spelling of life"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"With a three in it"
01:18:49;01:18:52;"It's two L's and then the E is a three"
01:18:52;01:18:53;"So it's cool"
01:18:53;01:18:55;"It's like a cooler way to"
01:18:55;01:18:58;"I love the occasional Seinfeld 2000"
01:18:58;01:18:59;"I know! Hey, what's up?"
01:18:59;01:19:01;"This is a, I'm in"
01:19:01;01:19:03;"Thanks for letting me on the mic this time, guys"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"All good"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"We know you love songs of the summer"
01:19:06;01:19:07;"The number eight song"
01:19:07;01:19:09;"In this first week of summer"
01:19:09;01:19:12;"Zedd and Alessia Cara, ""Stay"""
01:19:12;01:19:14;"We've heard this"
01:19:14;01:19:17;"Do you wanna hit me a modello?"
01:19:17;01:19:18;"You got it"
01:19:18;01:19:19;"Thank you, sir"
01:19:19;01:19:28;"Is Zedd from One Direction?"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"No"
01:19:30;01:19:32;"Zedd is a German DJ"
01:19:32;01:19:39;"Is this the one that Vin Diesel sang on?"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"That's kind of"
01:19:42;01:19:48;"Forever Young, dude"
01:19:48;01:20:08;"Oh yeah, I like this chorus"
01:20:09;01:20:12;"I like this song with the single"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"You know that one?"
01:20:14;01:20:15;"That little sample"
01:20:15;01:20:16;"Where?"
01:20:16;01:20:17;"It's coming"
01:20:17;01:20:21;"Oh, it's almost here"
01:20:21;01:20:24;"This is straight up Chainsmokers rip"
01:20:24;01:20:25;"I hear it"
01:20:25;01:20:30;"Dude, you're tapped in on the details of this song"
01:20:30;01:20:31;"Oh yeah"
01:20:31;01:20:32;"How do you know it so well?"
01:20:32;01:20:35;"It appears like, 'cause I work on this show"
01:20:35;01:20:37;"No, but seriously"
01:20:37;01:20:39;"'Cause it's always playing everywhere"
01:20:39;01:20:40;"I don't know"
01:20:40;01:20:43;"I'll have MTV on in the background at home or something"
01:20:43;01:20:46;"And I'm just like, here comes that"
01:20:46;01:20:49;"I really would have thought you would just have the Seinfeld loop"
01:20:49;01:20:50;"Oh, well, yeah"
01:20:50;01:20:53;"I'm honestly surprised how well you know this song"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"So what's the deal, Seinfeld?"
01:20:55;01:20:58;"First of all, I thought MTV didn't play music anymore"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"Well, MTVU plays music"
01:21:00;01:21:03;"Okay, so it's just on and you have the TV on?"
01:21:03;01:21:04;"Yeah"
01:21:04;01:21:05;"Randomly?"
01:21:05;01:21:08;"Yeah, you know, I'll be like, I'll have Seinfeld on mute"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"Making a stir fry for dinner"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"You'll be doing like four screens"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"I got my five screen experience"
01:21:14;01:21:17;"And then, yeah, I've got the MTVU on or whatever"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"And this song's on like every ten minutes or so"
01:21:19;01:21:20;"And then, yeah, you guys"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"I mean, Time Crisis plays it all the time too"
01:21:22;01:21:23;"Yeah, true"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"Alright, I mean, it's a good song"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"Stay a minute"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"But it's not as good as this one"
01:21:29;01:21:32;"The number seven song in the first week of summer"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"Holdin' Strong"
01:21:34;01:21:37;"After almost three months"
01:21:37;01:21:41;"Two legends coming together for this one"
01:21:41;01:21:44;"Chainsmokers and Coldplay"
01:21:44;01:21:45;"You know, 'cause on"
01:21:45;01:21:46;"This is the highlight so far"
01:21:46;01:21:49;"On Time Crisis, we always talk about the iTunes songs"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"Which vary more"
01:21:51;01:21:54;"So as we dip back into the Billboard songs"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"It's a reminder that it's stuck around"
01:21:56;01:21:58;"It's a hit"
01:21:58;01:22:03;"Um, can we assume everything is platinum?"
01:22:03;01:22:04;"Yes"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"All the songs we've listened to so far are platinum"
01:22:06;01:22:09;"Although this one is three times platinum in Italy"
01:22:09;01:22:10;"That's tough"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"Three million in Italy?"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"Well, no, different countries have different"
01:22:14;01:22:15;"Right, we've discussed that"
01:22:15;01:22:18;"Like, platinum in Montana"
01:22:18;01:22:19;"That's right"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"Is like 1,200 listens"
01:22:21;01:22:22;"This song was used as the theme for the"
01:22:22;01:22:26;"2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament"
01:22:26;01:22:28;"That's tight"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"This is the best Coldplay song"
01:22:30;01:22:36;"Wake Forest taking on Villanova"
01:22:36;01:22:40;"Starting forward for Gonzaga"
01:22:40;01:22:45;"Tough day for the University of Wisconsin Badgers"
01:22:45;01:22:50;"All this doing sports references is dicey"
01:22:50;01:22:53;"We're really on thin ice when we start talking sports"
01:22:53;01:22:56;"I want something just like this"
01:22:56;01:23:05;"The women in Dixieland"
01:23:05;01:23:07;"The legends and the myths"
01:23:07;01:23:09;"The testaments they told"
01:23:09;01:23:12;"The malelecs, the clubs"
01:23:12;01:23:14;"And Superman unloads"
01:23:14;01:23:17;"The suit before he lifts"
01:23:17;01:23:21;"But I'm not the kind of person that it fits"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"She said where'd she wanna go"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"How much she wanna risk"
01:23:25;01:23:30;"I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts"
01:23:30;01:23:35;"Some superhero, some fairy tale bliss"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"Just something I could turn to"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"Somebody I could risk"
01:23:39;01:23:42;"I want something just like this"
01:23:42;01:23:47;"The number six song on the charts"
01:23:47;01:23:49;"Now Jake, you were saying earlier"
01:23:49;01:23:52;"when you heard the beginning of the Post Malone song"
01:23:52;01:23:55;"you said, ""Is this Percocet?"""
01:23:55;01:23:57;"Okay, Percocet"
01:23:57;01:24:00;"How do you think the song goes? I'm curious"
01:24:00;01:24:01;"Percocet"
01:24:01;01:24:03;"Where's my f***ing Percocet?"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"Not even close, man"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"I don't know"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"I just remember it's Percocet"
01:24:09;01:24:10;"That's true"
01:24:10;01:24:11;"There's no song called"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"Well, there probably is a song called Percocet"
01:24:13;01:24:16;"But the song's called Mask Off by Future"
01:24:16;01:24:18;"And really the part you're thinking of goes"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"Percocet, Molly, Percocet"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"It's about drugs"
01:24:22;01:24:23;"Or at least part of it is"
01:24:23;01:24:24;"Great combo"
01:24:24;01:24:28;"This is cool"
01:24:28;01:24:29;"I don't know how it is"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"No, this song's great, yeah"
01:24:31;01:24:34;"This song samples Prison Song by Tommy Butler"
01:24:34;01:24:35;"Yeah, bitty"
01:24:35;01:24:40;"Yo, Percocet, Molly, Percocet"
01:24:40;01:24:43;"Oh, I thought it was Mildly Percocet"
01:24:43;01:24:46;"Percocet, Mildly Percocet"
01:24:47;01:24:50;"I did a mashup with Seinfeld"
01:24:50;01:24:51;"Oh, yeah"
01:24:51;01:24:53;"And then Future shared it on Facebook"
01:24:53;01:24:54;"Oh, really?"
01:24:54;01:24:55;"Yeah, and that was really cool"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"Future shared the Seinfeld remaster"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"Yeah, and he put the crying emoji"
01:24:59;01:25:00;"What was the mashup?"
01:25:00;01:25:01;"What was the Seinfeld part?"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"It was clips of Seinfeld"
01:25:03;01:25:05;"Other characters dancing and stuff"
01:25:05;01:25:06;"Oh, yeah, it was really good"
01:25:06;01:25:07;"Yeah"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"Also, this song is very haunting"
01:25:09;01:25:10;"'Cause it's called Mask Off"
01:25:10;01:25:13;"Because he says, ""Mask on, f***ing mask off"""
01:25:13;01:25:15;"Which is very simple imagery"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"But it's kind of, like, very eerie"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"The idea of having your mask on"
01:25:19;01:25:20;"And then you say, ""F***ing mask off"""
01:25:20;01:25:21;"I love those flutes"
01:25:21;01:25:24;"Yeah, I want to listen to where the sample's from"
01:25:24;01:25:25;"This is Tommy Butler?"
01:25:25;01:25:27;"Yeah, 1976"
01:25:27;01:25:28;"Oh, whoa"
01:25:28;01:25:31;"Cold cheers"
01:25:31;01:25:34;"Prison cells"
01:25:34;01:25:36;"I guess that was it at the beginning"
01:25:36;01:25:40;"Bars of steel"
01:25:40;01:25:43;"Meet my"
01:25:43;01:25:46;"Woman tonight"
01:25:46;01:25:49;"Just ain't"
01:25:49;01:25:52;"Feeling right"
01:25:52;01:25:55;"Cold cheers"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"It's from an album called The Selma Album"
01:25:57;01:26:02;"Which is a musical tribute to Martin Luther King"
01:26:02;01:26:03;"Bars of steel"
01:26:03;01:26:04;"Cool"
01:26:04;01:26:08;"He wears an iron"
01:26:08;01:26:09;"Very haunting song"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"Cold chairs"
01:26:11;01:26:13;"How big was this?"
01:26:13;01:26:14;"I don't think there was a..."
01:26:14;01:26:16;"Was this on a tiny label back then?"
01:26:16;01:26:19;"I don't think it was a particularly well-known song"
01:26:19;01:26:23;"I mean, now it is"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"Really, like, vibed it out"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"Yeah"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"What a production on this, Rules"
01:26:29;01:26:30;"No, this is a great song"
01:26:30;01:26:32;"To me, this is like..."
01:26:32;01:26:34;"It came out a little early to be Song of the Summer"
01:26:34;01:26:35;"But, like..."
01:26:35;01:26:37;"Well, also, I feel like Song of the Summer is more of, like, a party"
01:26:37;01:26:38;"I mean, this is a party song"
01:26:38;01:26:40;"But, like, Song of the Summer"
01:26:40;01:26:45;"Also infers, like, it's, like, upbeat"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"I mean, positive"
01:26:47;01:26:51;"This is some real, like, Don Draper, like, Fourth of July barbecue"
01:26:51;01:26:53;"Kids are just blasting pop radio off the speakers"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"And this is playing"
01:26:55;01:26:59;"You're just kind of, like, suburban dad, like, staring into the..."
01:26:59;01:27:00;"Coals"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"Just looking at this, like, piece of meat"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"Just, like, watching it, like, blacken"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"The camera, like, zooms in on, like, the blackening"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"It's like David Lynch style"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"Just like..."
01:27:10;01:27:17;"Frank, those burgers almost ready?"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"Percocet"
01:27:19;01:27:24;"This is some 2017 stuff, too, like..."
01:27:24;01:27:27;"Is Percocet, like, an opioid?"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"What is Percocet?"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Percocet's a painkiller, right?"
01:27:31;01:27:32;"So, it is, like, an opioid"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"I've never taken it recreationally"
01:27:34;01:27:38;"I hear about the opioid crisis, like, eight times a day"
01:27:38;01:27:40;"Yeah, Percocet's no joke"
01:27:40;01:27:42;"It's Oxycodone"
01:27:42;01:27:44;"Yeah, so it has..."
01:27:44;01:27:47;"What is the deal? I mean, this is kind of a sidetracking, but..."
01:27:47;01:27:49;"What's the deal?"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"What's the deal with Oxycodone?"
01:27:51;01:27:54;"What's the deal with opioids?"
01:27:54;01:27:57;"I mean, it's an epidemic, you know?"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"You know, Percocet, it's an..."
01:28:00;01:28:04;"Percocet is a combined opioid, non-opioid pain reliever"
01:28:04;01:28:08;"Yeah, like, you never got Percocet when you got your wisdom teeth out or something"
01:28:08;01:28:10;"Oh, yeah, I'm sure, yeah, or like Vicodin"
01:28:10;01:28:11;"It's like that kind of thing"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"Yeah, yeah, and obviously they're incredibly addictive"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"They're very easy to abuse"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"And, yeah, they're ruining people's lives"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"It's weird that, like, that's a thing on the market"
01:28:19;01:28:22;"It's the same chemical compound as, like, heroin"
01:28:22;01:28:23;"But..."
01:28:23;01:28:24;"Yeah, man"
01:28:24;01:28:27;"It just seems weird to me that that is a thing that..."
01:28:27;01:28:28;"Government..."
01:28:28;01:28:29;"People make money on"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"Government's the biggest drug pushers of all"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"Brutal"
01:28:33;01:28:34;"Yeah"
01:28:34;01:28:37;"But, come on, man, this is the song of the summer"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"We're not trying to..."
01:28:39;01:28:40;"I'm into that song"
01:28:40;01:28:41;"That's the top pick so far"
01:28:41;01:28:42;"So far"
01:28:42;01:28:43;"Yep"
01:28:43;01:28:44;"We'll wait 'til this"
01:28:44;01:28:47;"It edges out the Coldplay Chris Martin"
01:28:47;01:28:50;"Yeah, I think it has a touch more pathos"
01:28:50;01:28:51;"Oh, for sure"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"Yeah, it's a little bit"
01:28:53;01:28:57;"The next song on the Billboard charts right now"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"Is from the first week of summer"
01:28:59;01:29:00;"This song is huge"
01:29:00;01:29:01;"Still killing it"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"This song came out in April"
01:29:03;01:29:05;"This is the first single off Kendrick's new album"
01:29:05;01:29:06;"It's called ""Humble"""
01:29:06;01:29:07;"Oh, yeah"
01:29:07;01:29:08;"You remember this one, Jake?"
01:29:08;01:29:09;"Sure"
01:29:09;01:29:26;"Did he say ""Parmesan""?"
01:29:26;01:29:27;"Yes"
01:29:27;01:29:35;"Kendrick's done a great remix of ""Mask Off"""
01:29:35;01:29:37;"Oh, really?"
01:29:37;01:29:38;"Yeah, it's really good"
01:29:38;01:29:39;"Hold up on your block"
01:29:39;01:29:40;"Then break it down"
01:29:40;01:29:41;"We playing Tetris"
01:29:41;01:29:42;"A.M. to the B.M."
01:29:42;01:29:44;"B.M. to the A.M. funk"
01:29:44;01:29:45;"Beat up your per diem"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"You just got to hate 'em funk"
01:29:47;01:29:48;"If I quit your B.M."
01:29:48;01:29:50;"I still rock Mercedes funk"
01:29:50;01:29:51;"If I quit this season"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"I still be the greatest funk"
01:29:53;01:29:56;"My left stroke just went viral"
01:29:56;01:29:57;"Right stroke"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"Put lil' baby in a spiral"
01:29:59;01:30:02;"Soprano, see, we like to keep it on the high note"
01:30:02;01:30:03;"It's levels to it"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"You and I know"
01:30:05;01:30:06;"Tell 'em be humble"

01:31:46;01:31:47;"Hold up, hold up, hold up"
01:31:47;01:31:48;"Be humble"
01:31:48;01:31:49;"Hold up, hold up, hold up"
01:31:49;01:31:50;"Sit down"
01:31:50;01:31:51;"Hold up, hold up, hold up"
01:31:51;01:31:52;"I mean, this is a great song, can't say anything bad about it"
01:31:52;01:31:56;"But, if again, so far, we're talking about a song"
01:31:56;01:32:00;"that is gonna conjure thee truly to me"
01:32:00;01:32:03;"And again, we're not even going too deep into the lyrics or anything"
01:32:03;01:32:06;"'cause obviously that adds a lot of meaning to songs"
01:32:06;01:32:08;"But just in terms of the sound of these songs"
01:32:08;01:32:09;"The palette"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"The palette of these songs that you're hearing"
01:32:11;01:32:14;"because you don't always get a chance to sit down on the lyrics"
01:32:14;01:32:16;"These songs are just pumping out everywhere"
01:32:16;01:32:18;"'cause these are the big songs of the moment"
01:32:18;01:32:21;"Again, as much as I like ""Humble"""
01:32:21;01:32:24;"This sounds like summer 2017"
01:32:24;01:32:26;"Yeah, call it how it is"
01:32:26;01:32:27;"But we're not done yet"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"We're not done yet"
01:32:29;01:32:32;"We're gonna play the number four song"
01:32:32;01:32:34;"on the Billboard charts right now"
01:32:34;01:32:36;"This song's been out for a minute"
01:32:36;01:32:39;"People haven't really talked about this as a song of the summer contender"
01:32:39;01:32:42;"just because it's been out for such a long time"
01:32:42;01:32:46;"But it's killing it, still number four on the Billboard charts"
01:32:46;01:32:49;"It's on an album called ""Divide"""
01:32:49;01:32:50;"Ooh, wait, hold on"
01:32:50;01:32:53;"By a young man out of Great Britain"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"One Direction guy?"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"Not a One Direction guy"
01:32:57;01:32:58;"Oh, Sheeran!"
01:32:58;01:32:59;"Yeah"
01:32:59;01:33:00;"This song is--"
01:33:00;01:33:01;"Bedsheets!"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"Four times platinum"
01:33:03;01:33:04;"Just to put things in perspective"
01:33:04;01:33:06;"So he's getting a check for like 400 bucks"
01:33:06;01:33:07;"Oh yeah"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"He's hitting the Chinese buffet"
01:33:09;01:33:10;"Just--"
01:33:10;01:33:15;"When we were at Staples Center the other night"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"Notice he's playing three nights in August"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"Yeah"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"Time Crisis Field Trip"
01:33:21;01:33:22;"We might have to roll out"
01:33:22;01:33:24;"Can you imagine an Ed Sheeran show?"
01:33:24;01:33:25;"Well, you might find it interesting"
01:33:25;01:33:26;"How long is this set, you think?"
01:33:26;01:33:28;"Like a tight 90 and he's out?"
01:33:28;01:33:30;"Eh..."
01:33:30;01:33:32;"Hour and a half to two"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"Yeah, maybe it ends up being an hour, hour 50"
01:33:34;01:33:37;"You know, he's up on stage by himself most of the time"
01:33:37;01:33:38;"That's tight"
01:33:38;01:33:39;"Say what you will about the music"
01:33:39;01:33:40;"Like guitar?"
01:33:40;01:33:42;"Guitar, just a looper pedal"
01:33:42;01:33:43;"Beatboxing his heart out"
01:33:43;01:33:44;"Huh"
01:33:44;01:33:45;"He might have a keyboard"
01:33:45;01:33:46;"Interesting"
01:33:46;01:33:47;"No band"
01:33:47;01:33:50;"He's rolling up to Staples Center with less people"
01:33:50;01:33:53;"Than, um, GBV"
01:33:53;01:33:56;"Rolling up to the Silver Lake Lounge"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"So much with the GBV"
01:33:58;01:34:00;"I'm just saying, Ed Sheeran's rolling up to Staples Center"
01:34:00;01:34:01;"That's a five man band, yeah"
01:34:01;01:34:06;"He's rolling up with him, sound guy, light guy"
01:34:06;01:34:09;"And like one of his day one buddies"
01:34:09;01:34:12;"No one else on stage, that's crazy"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"Actually, I kind of would like to see him with like--"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"Alright, should I try to get his tickets?"
01:34:16;01:34:19;"It's a hot ticket, but I'll, you know, I'll make some calls"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"Yeah, I think we need to try to do that"
01:34:21;01:34:22;"Alright, alright, I'll try"
01:34:22;01:34:24;"This isn't the best place to find a lover"
01:34:24;01:34:26;"So the bar is where I go"
01:34:26;01:34:28;"The opening of the set with this?"
01:34:28;01:34:29;"That's a good question"
01:34:29;01:34:31;"Nah, he's gonna bury this a little bit"
01:34:31;01:34:34;"He might open with one of his more, uh"
01:34:34;01:34:38;"He has like his more anthemic songs, like U2's, though"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"I feel like this would be a closer"
01:34:40;01:34:41;"Uh-huh"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"Hmm"
01:34:43;01:34:46;"Opens the second encore with this"
01:34:46;01:34:49;"Somebody like me, come on now, follow my lead"
01:34:49;01:34:52;"I may be crazy, don't mind me, say boy"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"Let's not talk too much"
01:34:54;01:34:57;"Grab on my waist and put that body on me"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"Come on now, follow my lead"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"Come, come on now, follow my lead"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"Hmm"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"I'm in love with the shape of you"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"We push and pull like a magnet do"
01:35:07;01:35:10;"Although my heart is falling too"
01:35:10;01:35:12;"I'm in love with your body"
01:35:12;01:35:15;"Last night you were in my room"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"And now my bedsheets smell like you"
01:35:17;01:35:19;"Every day discover who's screaming brand new"
01:35:19;01:35:22;"I like Ed Sheeran, but I mean, Shape of You"
01:35:22;01:35:24;"Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"We've never talked about that song"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"We've never talked about this"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"Regardless of how we feel about the word bedsheets"
01:35:30;01:35:34;"Shape of You is the biggest song this year"
01:35:34;01:35:37;"Can't, you know, can't deny it"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"And honestly, that's a good message"
01:35:39;01:35:41;"Like, as much as some people don't like the bedsheets line"
01:35:41;01:35:44;"You know, not every word matters"
01:35:44;01:35:46;"It is what it is"
01:35:46;01:35:48;"I'm in love with the shape of you"
01:35:48;01:35:50;"The number three song on the Billboard charts right now"
01:35:50;01:35:52;"America's own Bruno Mars"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"That's what I like"
01:35:54;01:35:57;"Hey, hey, hey"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"I got a condo in Manhattan"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"Baby girl, what's happening?"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"You and your ass invited"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"So go on and get to clapping"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"Go pop a four-pack"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"I saw Bruno Mars' interview on TV"
01:36:09;01:36:11;"After his parents got divorced in Hawaii"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"And he and his brothers were staying with his dad"
01:36:13;01:36:15;"Who was unemployed at the time"
01:36:15;01:36:17;"And having like real rough times"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"Sleeping in cars"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"At one point they lived in this like weird"
01:36:21;01:36:25;"Like semi-functional building on a bird sanctuary"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"Whoa"
01:36:27;01:36:29;"So anyway, I was watching that and I was like"
01:36:29;01:36:31;"You know what man, Bruno Mars"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"He really made it happen"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"Not coming from very much"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"Always have a soft spot for him"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"Was he discovered in Hawaii?"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"Like how did he get his start?"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"I think like this classic"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"He was playing music with his family"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"Like performing at like resorts and stuff"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"And he would do an Elvis imitation"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"When he was like a really little kid"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"But I think pretty classic"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"Like came to the mainland with a dollar and a dream"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"Like flew to LA and was just like showed up"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"Yeah, like broke"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"Crashing on couches and he's doing his thing"

01:37:09;01:37:11;"Nice taking trips to Puerto Rico"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"Say the word and we go"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"You can be my freaka"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"Girl I'll be your freaka"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"I'm not a freaka promise that I can't keep"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"I promise I'll just love you"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"I'll never say I'm not a freaka"
01:43:43;01:43:45;"She the one that bring them raindrops"
01:43:45;01:43:47;"We go back remember crisscross and hopscotch"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"You the one that hold me down when the block's hot"
01:43:49;01:43:51;"I make your dreams come true when you wake up"

01:46:07;01:46:09;"Jake you correctly predicted the number one song"
01:46:09;01:46:11;"Right now on the chart so I guess this is more or less"
01:46:11;01:46:13;"The song of the summer I predicted two and one"
01:46:13;01:46:15;"Yes"
01:46:15;01:46:17;"Tapped in Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee"
01:46:17;01:46:19;"Featuring Justin Bieber Despacito"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"Sanfo what do you think of this song you fan"
01:46:21;01:46:23;"I feel like it's like"
01:46:23;01:46:25;"A throwback to like"
01:46:25;01:46:27;"The latin explosion"
01:46:27;01:46:29;"Of like the late 90s like"
01:46:29;01:46:31;"Remember when like Jennifer Lopez was starting"
01:46:31;01:46:33;"To pop off and like Ricky Martin and the"
01:46:33;01:46:35;"Spanish guitars kind of took over radio"
01:46:35;01:46:37;"Like eh this song"
01:46:37;01:46:39;"It's alright doesn't really do a lot"
01:46:39;01:46:41;"For me it's fine"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"Right and the truth is like"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"Latin music is one of like the"
01:46:45;01:46:47;"The biggest"
01:46:47;01:46:49;"I mean obviously there's many genres within it"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"But it's one of the biggest music markets"
01:46:51;01:46:53;"And genres in the world"
01:46:53;01:46:55;"So there's always something funny about"
01:46:55;01:46:57;"Like the American take of kind of like"
01:46:57;01:46:59;"Ooh Latin music is back"
01:46:59;01:47:01;"It's always like"
01:47:01;01:47:03;"Obviously"
01:47:03;01:47:05;"Obviously for like the vast majority"
01:47:05;01:47:07;"Of the Americas"
01:47:07;01:47:09;"Including many people within"
01:47:09;01:47:11;"North America Latin music never"
01:47:11;01:47:13;"Goes away so it's like the one or two"
01:47:13;01:47:15;"Songs that happen to cross over"
01:47:15;01:47:17;"They're not always like the best most indicative"
01:47:17;01:47:19;"Of like what's actually happening in Latin music"
01:47:19;01:47:21;"That said I have nothing wrong with this"
01:47:21;01:47:23;"Song Despacito"
01:47:23;01:47:25;"But it's like it's you know it's not"
01:47:25;01:47:27;"Doesn't mean it's the best song"
01:47:27;01:47:29;"But there's probably some more interesting ones happening"

01:48:13;01:48:15;"-Oh, totally."
01:48:15;01:48:15;"Well, you know, it's funny."
01:48:15;01:48:16;"We've heard this song so many times."
01:48:16;01:48:18;"We don't need to listen to it again."
01:48:18;01:48:19;"So you're talking about one of the artists --"
01:48:19;01:48:23;"We were talking about the late '90s Latin music explosion."
01:48:23;01:48:26;"And what's funny is that, arguably,"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"there's a little bit of a Latin crossover"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"happening on the American pop charts right now."

01:48:37;01:48:39;"who said, ""Now, this is the real song of the summer."""
01:48:39;01:48:42;"So I think it's worth throwing in as a bonus."
01:48:42;01:48:46;"Funnily enough, this song is based on a song"
01:48:46;01:48:50;"from Carlos Santana's late '90s breakthrough album,"
01:48:50;01:48:51;"""Supernatural."" -Oof!"
01:48:51;01:48:53;"-So this is DJ Khaled with Rihanna."
01:48:53;01:48:56;"The song is called ""Wild Thoughts,"""
01:48:56;01:49:02;"and it's fully based on a late '90s Latin song."
01:49:02;01:49:06;"But it's not actually Carlos Santana playing guitar."
01:49:06;01:49:09;"It's kind of like the karaoke version."
01:49:09;01:49:10;"-Like, fake Santana?"
01:49:10;01:49:14;"-Yeah, they kind of, like, recreated his guitar parts."

01:50:19;01:50:21;"-I mean, I guess it's a testament to this song"
01:50:21;01:50:23;"that they barely had to change it"

01:51:08;01:51:12;"-I'm pretty sure Wyclef was referencing Wu-Tang"
01:51:12;01:51:16;"when he did this song, which then Khaled is sampling."
01:51:16;01:51:18;"-Wow. I love the layers of intertexturality."
