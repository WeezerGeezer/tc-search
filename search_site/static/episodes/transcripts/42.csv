00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, May 7th."
00:05;00:09;"It's springtime in America."
00:09;00:15;"Jake and I talk about growing up baseball cards."
00:15;00:19;"Time Crisis, May 7th."
00:19;00:23;"It's springtime in America."
00:23;00:28;"Jake and I talk about growing up baseball cards."
00:28;00:38;"But we also think about people like Tom York, Chris Martin, and members of One Direction."
00:38;00:45;"This is a very special Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:45;00:48;"Beats 1."
00:49;00:54;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:54;01:02;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances."
01:02;01:09;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
01:09;01:16;"And so I dealt to the floor, one of us had to go."
01:16;01:20;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:20;01:26;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:26;01:31;"Leave me lonely babe."
01:31;01:35;"Time Crisis, May 7th, 2017."
01:35;01:40;"May 7th, people born on this day are drawn to a career by abstract circumstances."
01:40;01:44;"They do not have a specific plan for it, rather follow what they feel is a calling."
01:44;01:47;"These people are great at managing money."
01:47;01:50;"They also make good artists due to their natural creativity."
01:50;01:52;"Is that from the horoscope book?"
01:52;01:53;"Yeah, yeah."
01:53;01:56;"Almost every time I look at one of those horoscope books and I read my birthday, I'm like, ""Alright."""
01:56;01:57;"Yeah."
01:57;02:00;"And you go through and you look at other people's birthdays and you're like, ""Yeah."""
02:00;02:05;"If I remember correctly, February 3rd is exacting realism."
02:05;02:08;"Exacting realism? What does that mean?"
02:08;02:13;"It means brutal, straight down the line realism."
02:13;02:15;"It means you have a realistic outlook."
02:15;02:18;"I found that it fit me perfectly, eerily."
02:18;02:19;"February 3rd."
02:19;02:20;"So you're an Aquarian?"
02:20;02:21;"Aquarius."
02:21;02:22;"That makes you an Aquarian."
02:22;02:23;"Okay."
02:23;02:24;"I'm Arius."
02:24;02:25;"Does that make me an Arian?"
02:25;02:27;"I never heard of that before, but..."
02:27;02:31;"Well, I'm looking at a random website, or it's the first one that comes up when I googled"
02:31;02:33;"February 3rd analysis."
02:33;02:37;"If you were born on February 3rd, you have a way of seeing beyond the immediate issues"
02:37;02:37;"at hand."
02:37;02:40;"You are busy, but take time to smell the roses."
02:40;02:42;"Does that sound like you?"
02:42;02:45;"It does, but then again, who doesn't it sound like, right?"
02:45;02:47;"Well, that's a funny one."
02:47;02:49;"Everyone's like, ""I have a good perspective on life."""
02:49;02:49;"Right."
02:49;02:52;"You have a way of seeing beyond the immediate issues at hand."
02:52;02:57;"Who would look that up in the birthday book and be like, ""No, me, I'd never see beyond"
02:57;02:57;"the issues at hand."""
02:57;03:00;"I get stressed out about the most insignificant details."
03:00;03:01;"""I'm very myopic."
03:01;03:02;"I never..."""
03:02;03:04;"Maybe some people feel that way."
03:04;03:05;"What else does it say?"
03:05;03:10;"""Artistic, true, down to earth, and fascinating."""
03:10;03:10;"All right."
03:10;03:11;"I'm down to earth."
03:11;03:12;"Yeah."
03:12;03:13;"You're fascinating."
03:13;03:15;"You can be unconventional."
03:15;03:15;"That's nice."
03:15;03:17;"Yet may have conventional values."
03:17;03:18;"I think that's pretty straightforward."
03:18;03:20;"You put in the groundwork."
03:20;03:21;"Now it is time for the hard work to pay off."
03:21;03:22;"Wait, why is it?"
03:22;03:24;"Why is it like suddenly..."
03:24;03:26;"When does the hard work pay off?"
03:26;03:27;"Are you a devoted family member?"
03:27;03:30;"Okay, well, here's the negative parts."
03:30;03:32;"Aquarius."
03:32;03:34;"You find difficulty in dealing with other people's emotions."
03:34;03:37;"Wait, is this February 3rd specific or is this Aquarius?"
03:37;03:39;"I think now it's just getting into Aquarius."
03:39;03:42;"""Your friends think you are being hard or cold"
03:42;03:44;"when you choose not to chat about their problems."
03:44;03:47;"Nevertheless, your friends and family are supportive and devoted to you."""
03:47;03:49;"Does that happen a lot where someone's like,"
03:49;03:51;"""Jake, man, I'm going through some sh*t."""
03:51;03:53;"You're just like, ""You know what, Brad?"
03:53;03:55;"We're watching the game, man."
03:55;03:56;"Like, let's talk on Monday."""
03:56;03:58;"No, that's not my vibe at all."
03:58;04:00;"Been a rough few weeks, Jake."
04:00;04:01;"I mean, who doesn't have..."
04:01;04:01;"All right, all right."
04:01;04:02;"You want a beer?"
04:02;04:03;"Let's go to the bar."
04:03;04:06;"I love sitting down at a bar with a friend and just like hashing it out."
04:06;04:07;"Talking about life."
04:07;04:08;"Oh, yeah."
04:08;04:09;"Okay, maybe horoscopes aren't real."
04:09;04:13;"And who doesn't have problems dealing with other people's emotions?"
04:13;04:15;"I mean, that's tough."
04:15;04:15;"Right."
04:15;04:16;"What kind of psychopath would be..."
04:16;04:20;"Even if you're like a very empathic, kind person,"
04:20;04:23;"what kind of psychopath would see like..."
04:23;04:26;"Do you have problems dealing with other people's emotions?"
04:26;04:27;"Never."
04:27;04:27;"It's always easy."
04:27;04:29;"I'm great at it."
04:29;04:31;"That never causes problems."
04:31;04:32;"What's your birthday?"
04:32;04:33;"April 8th."
04:33;04:33;"You see what it says?"
04:33;04:34;"Yeah, yeah."
04:34;04:36;"Oh, yeah, the Cobain Day."
04:36;04:37;"Exactly."
04:37;04:38;"Cobain Day adjacent."
04:38;04:39;"April 8th."
04:39;04:40;"Analysis."
04:40;04:44;"If your birthday is on April 8th, you have a nose for business."
04:44;04:45;"Okay."
04:45;04:46;"Who could deny that?"
04:46;04:46;"You do."
04:46;04:48;"Vampire Weekend Incorporated."
04:48;04:52;"I'm the president of various LLCs and corporations."
04:52;04:53;"This radio show."
04:53;04:54;"That's right."
04:54;04:58;"Cross-platform synergistic branding opportunities."
04:58;04:58;"That's me."
04:58;05:00;"You're my boss, dude."
05:00;05:01;"That's right."
05:01;05:02;"Got various employees."
05:02;05:04;"I employ Aquarius."
05:04;05:06;"Oh, wait, it's funny."
05:06;05:10;"Your exceptional ability to be quick and sharp makes you a wanted Aryan."
05:10;05:12;"Oh, you are an Aryan."
05:12;05:15;"Yeah, well, it's spelled A-R-I-A-N."
05:15;05:19;"I always thought I was very un-Aryan, but I'm a wanted Aryan."
05:19;05:22;"You are first to show compassion for others and lend a helping hand."
05:22;05:23;"That's pretty on point."
05:23;05:26;"I mean, you're a busy guy, but honestly, if I called you at two in the morning and I was"
05:26;05:29;"like, ""Dude, I'm dealing with some heavy stuff right now."
05:29;05:33;"Can we meet at like the Denny's on Sunset and Gower?"
05:33;05:34;"I got to just talk this through."""
05:34;05:35;"I feel like you'd be there."
05:35;05:38;"Yeah, my phone would probably be on airplane mode a lot at night, but..."
05:38;05:39;"Okay."
05:39;05:40;"No, but if I got..."
05:40;05:42;"I mean, if I was pounding on your door at 3 a.m."
05:42;05:42;"Oh, if you're pounding on the..."
05:42;05:43;"Of course."
05:43;05:43;"No."
05:43;05:44;"You know, it'd be all good."
05:44;05:48;"And I'll be honest, when you described that scenario, getting like the 2 a.m. call from"
05:48;05:51;"you to meet at the Denny's on Sunset to talk about some..."
05:51;05:54;"My first thought was like, ""That sounds like an absolute pleasure."""
07:53;07:56;"We were having an interesting conversation before the show, Jake."
07:56;07:58;"About the Zeppelin reunion, or what are we talking about?"
07:58;08:04;"Well, first I wanted to talk about the fact that you used to be a very hardcore baseball"
08:04;08:05;"card collector."
08:05;08:07;"That's true, I did."
08:07;08:08;"And we were kind of talking about..."
08:08;08:14;"I don't mean to make this gender specific, but at least when we were kids, the baseball"
08:14;08:17;"card comic book scenes were primarily male."
08:17;08:19;"The dealers and the collectors."
08:19;08:24;"Well, the dealers and the collectors, and I'm sure there were a lot of female collectors"
08:24;08:27;"who probably felt like weirded out by the fact every time they go to a store, it's like"
08:27;08:29;"a 45-year-old dude in there."
08:29;08:35;"But we were talking about the specific and weird relationship that you have when you're"
08:35;08:43;"like a 10, 11, 12-year-old boy, and you go into these spaces where there's like the random"
08:43;08:46;"dude that you have to deal with."
08:46;08:46;"Yeah."
08:46;08:51;"So to start, just paint a picture for people, because I don't even know if people buy baseball"
08:51;08:53;"cards anymore today, like young kids."
08:53;08:57;"Yeah, or if they do, they might do it on the internet or like..."
08:57;09:01;"I think people buy cards, but I mean, I think cards..."
09:01;09:08;"So I was born in '77, so I was like, let's say I was like 12 and 89, 13 in 1990."
09:08;09:13;"And that was like, I think one of the first major crests of the baseball card market."
09:14;09:20;"It was a hot market, cards sold for a lot of money, old cards from the 60s and 70s were"
09:20;09:21;"really expensive."
09:21;09:26;"New cards were really hot, like an 89 Upper Deck Ken Griffey Junior Rookie card."
09:26;09:31;"Like you might get in a pack, like if you bought a pack for $2, you might get a Ken"
09:31;09:36;"Griffey Rookie card that was like 100 bucks, like worth 100 bucks."
09:36;09:37;"So that was like a big deal when you're 12."
09:37;09:42;"It was an intersection of sports fandom, object fetishism..."
09:42;09:44;"Yeah, memorabilia it's called."
09:44;09:45;"And young capitalism."
09:45;09:46;"Yep."
09:46;09:48;"All combining into just a toxic combo."
09:48;09:53;"And so yes, before the internet, so then you'd go to these like random crappy little"
09:53;09:58;"stores that popped up in like every other strip mall around the United States."
09:58;09:59;"They set up overnight."
09:59;10:04;"There'd be like the glass cases, you know, it's like under the countertop with all the"
10:04;10:06;"like individual cards, like the..."
10:06;10:07;"More valuable ones."
10:07;10:07;"Right."
10:07;10:08;"Mickey Mantle."
10:08;10:09;"Yeah."
10:09;10:12;"A Cal Ripken Junior card, Rookie card, you know, like that kind of stuff."
10:13;10:15;"And like, I'd go there with my mom."
10:15;10:21;"So my mom's like in her 40s, taking her like 12 year old son to this like random strip"
10:21;10:23;"mall to buy cards."
10:23;10:26;"And I, you know, and like my budget was severely limited."
10:26;10:27;"Right."
10:27;10:29;"It was just like, I don't know."
10:29;10:30;"I don't know how we got into this the other day, but..."
10:30;10:35;"It made me think, I wasn't really that into baseball cards, but I like going to the comic"
10:35;10:37;"book store and there's like a sim..."
10:37;10:39;"Yeah, like I picture a very similar scenario."
10:39;10:41;"Like my mom takes me there."
10:41;10:44;"There's like, I can't even guess how old these guys would have been."
10:44;10:45;"For all I know, they were like 25."
10:45;10:46;"Yeah, I know."
10:46;10:47;"They seem like they're 40, but..."
10:47;10:52;"And they're like kind of like weird old, like Simpsons-esque comic book store guys."
10:52;10:52;"Yeah."
10:52;10:58;"And you'd have these like funny interactions, like you'd have like some question, you feel"
10:58;11:03;"really nervous and just be like, ""Um, do you have the two issues ago?"""
11:03;11:05;"Punisher War Journal number three."
11:08;11:11;"Uncanny X-Men versus Amazing X-Men."
11:11;11:13;"Guru the Wanderer."
11:13;11:20;"There's just something really funny about being that age and like interacting with these"
11:20;11:22;"like random older dudes."
11:22;11:24;"Maybe it's kind of lost to time."
11:24;11:26;"I don't know if that still exists."
11:26;11:29;"Like, yeah, just going into some random strip mall."
11:29;11:32;"It would be like a great Netflix series."
11:32;11:34;"The baseball card guys are weirder than the comic book store guys."
11:34;11:35;"Yeah."
11:35;11:36;"I feel like I understand."
11:36;11:42;"Comic book store guys, they're just nerdy fans and it kind of makes sense that they"
11:42;11:45;"would like, I don't know, that doesn't sound like such a bad job to me."
11:45;11:47;"It's like a slow day."
11:47;11:48;"You're just looking at all the new comics."
11:48;11:49;"Well, and like comics are like art."
11:49;11:51;"Yeah."
11:51;11:52;"So there's something to appreciate."
11:52;12:01;"Well, sports memorabilia is just like photographs printed on two and a half by four inch pieces"
12:01;12:01;"of cardboard."
12:01;12:04;"Like baseball cards suck."
12:04;12:05;"Right."
12:05;12:05;"Like you could."
12:05;12:07;"I used to go to like those baseball card fairs."
12:07;12:10;"Oh, just so brutal."
12:10;12:12;"Like, OK, like off season."
12:12;12:15;"Like, OK, winter in Connecticut circa 1990."
12:15;12:20;"There's a baseball card convention at the Sheridan off Interstate 84."
12:20;12:26;"A gray New England sky, bare trees in the parking lot of the Sheridan."
12:26;12:28;"Mom, there's a baseball card convention in two Saturdays."
12:28;12:31;"Can you take me to the Sheridan?"
12:31;12:32;"It's really close."
12:33;12:37;"My mom, goodness of her heart, she takes me to this like 10 a.m."
12:37;12:38;"going to the Sheridan."
12:38;12:49;"Roger Clemens is there sitting behind a folding table behind those like velvet ropes security."
12:49;12:49;"To sign stuff."
12:49;12:50;"Yeah, yeah."
12:50;12:51;"He's charging $30 an autograph."
12:51;12:54;"And Roger Clemens was like a big baseball player of the moment."
12:54;12:54;"Huge."
12:54;12:58;"He was like one of the great pitchers in Major League history."
12:58;13:01;"And but like, you know, like at the height of his career."
13:01;13:03;"Well, the first phase of his career before steroids."
13:03;13:05;"Oh, late 80s."
13:05;13:10;"He's sitting in a separate like banquet room at the Sheridan."
13:10;13:15;"He has like his high school bro from Houston running security."
13:15;13:18;"And you have to pay $30 to enter the room."
13:18;13:21;"And then you're in this line to like get his autograph."
13:21;13:24;"My mom was like, we're not spending $30 on a Roger Clemens autograph."
13:24;13:25;"We're just not doing it."
13:25;13:27;"But then she goes up to the bouncer and she's like,"
13:28;13:31;"do you think my son and I could just get a look at Roger?"
13:31;13:34;"Which is just like adorable."
13:34;13:37;"I want that to happen."
13:37;13:39;"And she thought of that and like is making it happen."
13:39;13:41;"And he's like, OK, so he like lets us in."
13:41;13:43;"And like we're like standing across."
13:43;13:46;"We're still like a good 80 feet out from Clemens."
13:46;13:50;"Yeah, he's just like fat, like offseason."
13:50;13:51;"Roger Clemens at 89."
13:51;13:52;"Kenny Powers style."
13:52;13:56;"He's probably clearing like, I don't know, five, eight grand that day."
13:57;14:02;"I'm sitting in like this like weird baggy, like sweat's fine, a folding table."
14:02;14:06;"Just like signing autographs and like barely making eye contact."
14:06;14:10;"In a random deep Connecticut, Sheridan."
14:10;14:23;"The house is like, this is dark."
14:24;14:25;"You move on again."
14:25;14:29;"See that turn out to flee again."
14:29;14:33;"You always make it all right."
14:33;14:37;"Ah, is that for you?"
14:37;14:41;"Let's get along again."
14:41;14:54;"You know you're more on the fence."
14:54;15:17;"You know you're more on the fence."
15:17;15:26;"Ah, is that for you?"
15:26;15:51;"The morning only shows."
15:52;16:00;"So,"
16:01;16:09;"so,"
16:27;16:46;"so,"
16:47;16:55;"so,"
16:55;17:09;"I want you to see."
17:09;17:16;"I want to make it all right."
17:16;17:22;"Don't you be so easy."
17:22;17:28;"Don't you know that I can make it better."
17:28;17:34;"Don't you ever leave me."
17:34;17:40;"Don't you leave me."
17:40;18:08;"Together."
18:08;18:14;"Don't you be so easy."
18:14;18:22;"Don't you know that I can make it better."
18:22;18:28;"Don't you ever leave me."
18:28;18:48;"Don't you leave me."
18:48;18:49;"You know what just happened this week?"
18:49;18:50;"Vampire Weekend News?"
18:50;18:51;"No."
18:51;18:53;"It was just so random."
18:53;18:56;"Like, randomly there's like some official account on Twitter called"
18:56;18:58;"Canadian Platinum and Gold."
18:58;18:59;"Uh-huh."
18:59;19:02;"And this past week it just tagged me in a tweet that said,"
19:02;19:07;"""Today, the Vampire Weekend single 'A-Punk' from their first album went gold in Canada."""
19:07;19:08;"Wait, what does that even mean?"
19:08;19:11;"I don't even know what the threshold for Canadian gold is."
19:11;19:14;"In America it's 500,000, so in Canada it's probably much less."
19:14;19:15;"But like, the single?"
19:15;19:19;"So that must include purchases on the iTunes store."
19:19;19:21;"Yes, when you individually buy it on the iTunes store."
19:21;19:24;"And maybe now it counts streams or something, but just 10 years--"
19:24;19:25;"No, it wouldn't count streams."
19:25;19:27;"I'm sure ""A-Punk"" has been streamed like a million times, right?"
19:27;19:29;"On Canada, I don't know."
19:29;19:30;"Oh, I'm sure."
19:30;19:33;"But anyway, this is like 10 years deep."
19:33;19:35;"You sold 500,000 copies of that song."
19:35;19:36;"No, no, no, that's the American threshold."
19:36;19:37;"Actually, let's look up what--"
19:37;19:38;"No, I'm sure it's the same thing, right?"
19:38;19:39;"No, what are you talking about?"
19:39;19:40;"Canada's like--"
19:40;19:41;"Small country?"
19:41;19:44;"Canada's like, what, 18 million people, 20?"
19:44;19:45;"Canadian gold."
19:45;19:47;"Great Neil Young record."
19:47;19:48;"Is that a record?"
19:48;19:49;"No, I'm kidding."
19:49;19:50;"Sounds like it."
19:50;19:54;"Actually, this is kind of interesting, the recording music certifications."
19:54;19:57;"It's changed a lot in the internet era."
19:57;20:00;"The US is one of the countries that hasn't changed that much."
20:00;20:04;"Yeah, in the US, 500,000 to go gold."
20:04;20:06;"In Canada, 40,000."
20:06;20:07;"Okay."
20:07;20:09;"So that just means like--"
20:09;20:11;"Like 8%?"
20:11;20:14;"Yeah, probably like in the past few months, just like--"
20:14;20:16;"That might be scaled to population, actually."
20:16;20:17;"No, no, of course it is."
20:17;20:21;"No, no, like the US is like 320 million or something."
20:21;20:22;"It sounds about right."
20:22;20:25;"What's 8% of that, like 20 million or something, 25 million?"
20:25;20:27;"You know what's gold in Ecuador?"
20:27;20:28;"8,000?"
20:28;20:29;"3,000."
20:29;20:31;"Japan, 100,000."
20:31;20:32;"How about like states?"
20:32;20:34;"Like what's gold in California?"
20:34;20:36;"Oh, they don't do that, but that'd be hilarious if they did."
20:36;20:37;"Wouldn't that be cool though?"
20:37;20:38;"Like, oh dude, it went gold in North Dakota."
20:38;20:39;"It sold like nine copies."
20:39;20:44;"I don't know if the streaming services do this, but back in the day when you would get"
20:44;20:49;"like from your label the breakdown of sales, it was like hyper specific."
20:49;20:53;"Now people pay more attention to streaming than sales, but I like remember our label"
20:53;20:58;"would send like the-- not even like first week, just some random week, they would send"
20:58;21:00;"the breakdown of your sound scan."
21:00;21:06;"So just, you know, just picture this like in like 2014, you could see like, oh, this"
21:06;21:15;"week, four years after it came out in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, Contra sold 87 copies."
21:15;21:17;"You still get that still?"
21:17;21:18;"I don't know."
21:18;21:20;"Well, I haven't seen it in a long time, but it exists."
21:20;21:22;"I could probably ask somebody to send it to me."
21:22;21:23;"Oh my God."
21:23;21:27;"It gets you wondering like who were like the 32 people in Savannah, Georgia--"
21:27;21:28;"Who bought Contra."
21:28;21:30;"Who bought Contra."
21:30;21:35;"I mean, I understand why it's, you know, it's such a big business now, like selling consumer"
21:35;21:36;"data."
21:36;21:37;"Right."
21:37;21:39;"It's messed up, but it is fascinating."
21:39;21:42;"If I had access to that stuff, I would look at it all day."
21:42;21:46;"You can get some fairly detailed info on like the streaming services and on Spotify, they"
21:46;21:48;"do like an artist breakdown."
21:48;21:51;"And actually as an artist, you kind of can't look at this stuff too much because it would"
21:51;21:52;"drive you crazy."
21:52;21:53;"Sure."
21:53;21:58;"But in the streaming era, you could literally see how many people streamed a song every"
21:58;22:00;"day or like the average."
22:00;22:01;"Wow."
22:01;22:03;"I don't want to talk about the big songs."
22:03;22:04;"Let's go into like the deep songs."
22:04;22:07;"What do you consider to be like a deep, random Vampire Weekend song?"
22:07;22:10;"Like Hannah Hunt or is that the name of it?"
22:10;22:11;"Oh, you'd be surprised."
22:11;22:14;"Hannah Hunt is our sixth most streamed song."
22:14;22:15;"That's a fan favorite."
22:15;22:16;"Shout out to the fans."
22:16;22:17;"What about like Orchata?"
22:17;22:19;"That's our ninth most streamed song."
22:19;22:20;"Okay."
22:20;22:21;"I'm going to go deeper."
22:21;22:22;"I want to go deeper."
22:22;22:28;"What's like the second to last track on the vampires in the city, modern vampires in the"
22:28;22:29;"city?"
22:29;22:30;"Oh, Hudson."
22:30;22:31;"Yeah."
22:31;22:32;"The weird like minor key."
22:32;22:33;"Yeah, minor key."
22:33;22:34;"That's our 33rd most streamed song."
22:34;22:35;"Okay."
22:35;22:36;"Yeah."
22:36;22:37;"Let's get it."
22:37;22:38;"It's lower."
22:38;22:41;"Hudson today on Spotify was streamed 2,700 times."
22:41;22:42;"That's a lot, dude."
22:42;22:43;"Yeah."
22:43;22:44;"You know, that's not bad."
22:44;22:49;"To put things in perspective, like that DJ Khaled song was probably streamed 9 million"
22:49;22:51;"times today, but you know."
22:51;22:57;"What do you think like a mid-level, like Emerson, Lake and Palmer song was streamed?"
22:57;22:58;"Like a rando?"
22:58;23:01;"Yeah, not like Lucky Man."
23:01;23:04;"Like the 10th most popular Emerson, Lake and Palmer song."
23:04;23:05;"10th most?"
23:05;23:09;"It might not be that much better than Hudson, maybe a little lower."
23:09;23:10;"Just because think about it."
23:10;23:11;"Lucky Man."
23:11;23:15;"Lucky Man is probably putting up 6K."
23:15;23:16;"I don't know."
23:16;23:17;"6,000?"
23:17;23:19;"I mean, the user base."
23:19;23:22;"Oh, what a lucky man."
23:22;23:25;"The user base of Spotify probably is like a little bit younger."
23:25;23:31;"I mean, I'll show you like today, A Punk, our most streamed song was streamed 84,000"
23:31;23:32;"times."
23:32;23:33;"Wow."
23:33;23:34;"But then on the bottom."
23:34;23:35;"That's a lot, bro."
23:35;23:36;"That's a classic song."
23:36;23:41;"Makes you feel good."
23:41;23:43;"And also, you know, people watch Step Brothers."
23:43;23:44;"Sure."
23:44;23:45;"It's a classic song."
23:45;23:46;"What's that song?"
23:46;23:47;"Okay."
23:47;23:50;"Our lowest streaming songs are all like remixes."
23:50;23:56;"California English, live from Bonnaroo, put up 387."
23:56;23:58;"Even that sounds like a lot to me."
23:58;24:02;"I apologize to anybody who's listening to us live from Bonnaroo."
24:02;24:03;"What about that?"
24:03;24:04;"I just don't recall being that tight."
24:04;24:06;"That weird deep cut we played once."
24:06;24:07;"B-side."
24:07;24:09;"Oh, from the movie soundtrack?"
24:09;24:10;"Yeah."
24:10;24:11;"Jonathan Lowe."
24:11;24:12;"Yeah."
24:12;24:14;"It's not available on Spotify."
24:14;24:18;"All these songs came out a little bit in the pre-streaming era."
24:18;24:19;"Right."
24:19;24:23;"I'm curious, like when dropping an album, the one I'm working on now, because honestly,"
24:23;24:24;"the music industry is crazy now."
24:24;24:27;"People, they're all like obsessed with streaming."
24:27;24:30;"When they even talk about like what order to put their songs in on a record, they're"
24:30;24:36;"just like, uh, look, that might've been cool 10 years ago, but in the streaming era, I"
24:36;24:38;"think we got to blah, blah, blah."
24:38;24:40;"Just like front load the record."
24:40;24:44;"Yeah, because in the streaming era, everybody's obsessed with like skip rates and stuff."
24:44;24:45;"What is that?"
24:45;24:50;"If they put your song on a playlist, which, cause also think about it, like say you want"
24:50;24:52;"to listen to a Guided by Voices song."
24:52;24:53;"You're a fan."
24:53;24:54;"You're coming to Guided by Voices."
24:54;24:57;"You're going to listen to like, what's a classic GBV song for you?"
24:57;24:58;"Game of Pricks."
24:58;24:59;"So Jake wants your Game of Pricks."
24:59;25:01;"He goes on to streaming service."
25:01;25:02;"He plays it."
25:02;25:03;"Yeah."
25:03;25:04;"He knows what he's looking for."
25:04;25:05;"He searches Guided by Voices, Game of Pricks."
25:05;25:06;"He listens to it."
25:06;25:11;"Now, for all the other users who don't know Guided by Voices or are not thinking about"
25:11;25:15;"them on a daily, it's safe to say you think about Guided by Voices every day."
25:15;25:16;"Yeah."
25:16;25:17;"Right."
25:17;25:18;"Very safe to say."
25:18;25:23;"So for everybody else, they're probably going to be introduced to Guided by Voices via playlist."
25:23;25:24;"Via the show maybe."
25:24;25:25;"Or yeah, or via the show."
25:25;25:26;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
25:26;25:27;"I get it."
25:27;25:33;"But so let's say somehow you landed Guided by Voices on the Rap Hits of Today playlist."
25:33;25:37;"Suddenly, you might get a million people listening to it in a day."
25:37;25:40;"How many of those people are going to keep listening to it is debatable."
25:40;25:42;"But like, so people really want to get on playlists now."
25:42;25:47;"They're tracking like, if it's like 20 seconds in, everyone's just like skipping forward."
25:47;25:48;"Exactly."
25:48;25:53;"So say Jake, you're one of like the major players in the 90s indie rock playlist scene."
25:53;25:54;"Which I am."
25:54;25:55;"Which you are."
25:55;25:58;"So you got Jake's 90s indie rock playlist, which I guess you got to make now."
25:58;25:59;"You can put it up on our-"
25:59;26:01;"Actually dude, I started a second playlist."
26:01;26:04;"It's punk, post-punk, and alternative workout mix."
26:04;26:05;"But we'll get to that later."
26:05;26:06;"Oh really?"
26:06;26:07;"Yeah."
26:07;26:10;"You could look at that data, and you might be like, ""You know, I started off with Breeder's"
26:10;26:13;"Cannonball, feel good classic song."
26:13;26:14;"Everybody loves it."""
26:14;26:19;"And then I went into Game of Pricks as a track two on my playlist, and I got, the skip rate"
26:19;26:21;"was very high."
26:21;26:22;"And then you might be like, ""You know what?"
26:22;26:24;"I want people to like play through my whole playlist."
26:24;26:26;"Like get out of here, Guided by Voices."""
26:27;26:33;"We're rooting by spark, and our vision grows."
26:33;26:40;"I present my flags high, but emotions won't grow."
26:40;26:46;"Retreating our way, taking the curve that grows."
26:46;26:53;"And love, love will tear us apart, again."
26:53;26:59;"Love, love will tear us apart, again."
26:59;27:09;"Why is the bedroom so cold?"
27:09;27:12;"Turn away on your side."
27:12;27:15;"Is my timing bad for?"
27:15;27:19;"I respect your soul and pride."
27:19;27:26;"There's still less of you in every wildfire."
27:26;27:32;"And love, love will tear us apart, again."
27:32;27:39;"Love, love will tear us apart, again."
27:39;28:05;"[Instrumental]"
28:05;28:11;"I'm in your sleep, all my feelings exposed."
28:11;28:18;"Yet it's tasting my throat, as desperation seems cold."
28:18;28:25;"Is it something so good, just an emotional blood?"
28:25;28:31;"And love, love will tear us apart, again."
28:31;28:37;"Love, love will tear us apart, again."
28:37;28:44;"Love, love will tear us apart, again."
28:51;29:11;"[Instrumental]"
29:11;29:15;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
29:15;29:35;"[Instrumental]"
29:35;29:39;"Spitting in a wishing well."
29:39;29:43;"You're on your hell crash, on the last splash."
29:43;29:54;"[Instrumental]"
29:54;29:58;"I know you feel the pain."
29:58;30:02;"I know you're a real creep."
30:02;30:19;"[Instrumental]"
30:19;30:23;"Can't be shaped, can't be shaped."
30:27;30:36;"[Instrumental]"
30:36;30:40;"I know you will know that you're true."
30:40;30:44;"I know you're a cannonball."
30:44;30:49;"[Instrumental]"
30:49;30:53;"I'll be your whatever you want."
30:53;30:57;"The bomb in this reggae song."
30:57;31:17;"[Instrumental]"
31:17;31:21;"Spitting in a wishing well."
31:21;31:26;"You're on your hell crash, on the last splash."
31:26;31:30;"[Instrumental]"
31:30;31:34;"I'll be your whatever you want."
31:34;31:38;"The bomb in this reggae song."
31:38;31:55;"[Instrumental]"
31:55;31:59;"Can't be shaped, can't be shaped."
32:03;32:06;"So do you know the skip rates on your songs?"
32:06;32:08;"No, they don't give you the skip rates."
32:08;32:11;"But also because we haven't released music in a long time,"
32:11;32:13;"we're not really worried about playlists right now."
32:13;32:15;"You know, they show you which playlists you're on."
32:15;32:17;"We're not like a majorly playlisted band"
32:17;32:20;"because that often tends to be about new music."
32:20;32:25;"Do you think like Jimmy Page is getting like a Led Zeppelin stream breakdown?"
32:25;32:26;"Definitely. In fact--"
32:26;32:28;"You think he's looking at it and he's just like,"
32:28;32:31;"""I love the skip rate and a whole lot of love when we get to that trippy part."""
32:31;32:34;"In fact, I'm gonna look at the Spotify page for Led Zeppelin."
32:34;32:38;"No disrespect to our employers, Apple Music,"
32:38;32:40;"who also have a quality streaming service."
32:40;32:43;"But the only reason that Spotify is interesting for this conversation"
32:43;32:45;"is because they show the numbers."
32:45;32:46;"Yeah."
32:46;32:49;"Which is like for heads like us is hilarious."
32:49;32:52;"No, but the numbers are only available to you."
32:52;32:55;"Well, okay. To get that daily breakdown that I looked at,"
32:55;32:56;"I could only look at that for my band."
32:56;32:57;"Yeah, you had to log in."
32:57;33:00;"But to look at Led Zeppelin, I can still see how many cumulative plays they have."
33:00;33:01;"Oh, yeah, sure, sure."
33:01;33:03;"So what do you think is Led Zeppelin's most streamed song?"
33:03;33:07;"I mean, I want to say ""Stairway,"" but I don't know, ""Black Dog"" or--"
33:07;33:10;"No, dude, ""Stairway"" by Far."
33:10;33:11;"Sure."
33:11;33:14;"""Stairway"" has racked up 115 million streams,"
33:14;33:17;"which means that Jimmy Page and the boys,"
33:17;33:22;"they might each be taking home like 50K after taxes, you know, 25K."
33:22;33:24;"You know, that's a new vintage guitar for Jimmy."
33:24;33:27;"And then the second, the runner-up, ""Whole Lotta Love,"" 65 million."
33:27;33:29;"So now-- Okay, so--"
33:29;33:30;"That's a harsh drop-off."
33:30;33:31;"Yeah, man."
33:31;33:33;"""Stairway"" to ""Whole Lotta."""
33:33;33:35;"So the biggest Led Zeppelin song--"
33:35;33:36;"""Fool in the Rain."""
33:36;33:37;"115 mil."
33:37;33:38;"Okay."
33:38;33:40;"What do you think is the biggest ""Guided by Voices"" song?"
33:40;33:42;"""I'm a Scientist""?"
33:42;33:43;"That's the fourth."
33:43;33:45;"""Hold on, Hope."""
33:45;33:46;"Oh, God, of course."
33:46;33:48;"That was on their major label album."
33:48;33:50;"Not a good song."
33:50;33:51;"It was on like--"
33:51;33:53;"It was featured on a lot of like TV shows."
33:53;33:54;"Okay, so that's why."
33:54;33:55;"It's really--"
33:55;33:56;"""Game of Pricks"" is number two, but--"
33:56;33:58;"See, that's depressing for me as a GBV fan."
33:58;34:00;"Well, you haven't even heard the depressing part yet."
34:00;34:01;"Okay, no, no, no."
34:01;34:03;"What I was saying, ""Hold on, Hope"" is not part of the conversation."
34:03;34:06;"Well, clearly the GBV head community has failed the band."
34:06;34:09;"Well, I think the band failed them with that song."
34:09;34:14;"Anyway, ""Hold on, Hope,"" the most streamed ""Guided by Voices"" song on Spotify."
34:14;34:16;"I have to guess the place."
34:16;34:18;"Yeah, so keep in mind, ""Stairway"" to heaven, 115 million."
34:18;34:21;"I don't know, 800,000?"
34:21;34:23;"Oh, no, you came in too low."
34:23;34:24;"2.5 mil."
34:24;34:25;"Okay."
34:25;34:27;"What about ""Game of Pricks""?"
34:27;34:29;"1.2 mil."
34:29;34:30;"Respectable."
34:30;34:37;"So 1.2 mil, that means Spotify is cutting GBV in the back, roughly a $4,000 check."
34:37;34:39;"I can't even tell with all this stuff anymore."
34:39;34:40;"You got that on lock."
34:40;34:42;"Wait, so what's that percentage, like .5?"
34:42;34:51;"I just know because I'm a music industry professional that roughly the Spotify numbers are like a million streams on Spotify is $4,000."
34:51;34:53;"So 10 million is roughly $40,000."
34:53;34:56;"100 million, $400,000."
34:56;35:00;"A billion streams, which I think only three songs have ever gotten."
35:00;35:01;"That's happened?"
35:01;35:03;"Oh, yeah, like Drake, Drake and--"
35:03;35:05;"Highline Bling, that one?"
35:05;35:07;"Maybe One Dance."
35:07;35:09;"I don't even know it."
35:09;35:11;"If I heard it, I would know it."
35:11;35:14;"Or like, you know, Major Lazer, some giant--"
35:14;35:15;"Major Lazer?"
35:15;35:17;"Yeah, they had a really big song called ""Hold On."""
35:17;35:19;"All I'm saying is--"
35:19;35:20;"A billion."
35:20;35:24;"If you got a billion plays, I guess they'd be cutting a check for $4 million."
35:24;35:26;"What are the top streaming vampire ones?"
35:26;35:28;"Um, you know."
35:28;35:30;"Vampire versus GBV, here we go."
35:30;35:32;"You're gonna crush them."
35:32;35:35;"Yeah, I don't want to-- no, that's an unfair question."
35:35;35:38;"I don't want it to seem like I'm coming after GBV."
35:38;35:40;"No, no, no, no, no, it's contextual."
35:40;35:41;"I'm not saying you're coming after them."
35:41;35:44;"So A-Punk has got about $94 million."
35:44;35:45;"Holy cow."
35:45;35:47;"We're nipping at the heels of Stairway."
35:47;35:49;"Dude!"
35:49;35:51;"See, okay, that's--"
35:51;35:55;"Many people have said that the guitar part for A-Punk is kind of like the Stairway riff of--"
35:55;35:56;"What?"
35:56;36:00;"No, of course not."
36:00;36:01;"But then it's a drop-off."
36:01;36:03;"Unbelievers, $53 million."
36:03;36:04;"Step, $38 million."
36:04;36:06;"Dying Young, $42 million."
36:06;36:07;"I mean, these are decent."
36:07;36:11;"So how do you think that, like, someone that's not a fan of Vampire Weekend"
36:11;36:16;"only listens to A-Punk and then doesn't continue to Unbelievers?"
36:16;36:20;"So there's a $40 million listener drop-off from A-Punk to Unbelievers."
36:20;36:24;"Or GBV, it's Hold On To Hope to Game of Pranks is like $2 million--"
36:24;36:26;"or, you know, like a million drop-off."
36:26;36:30;"Well, there's two ways to look at the streaming stuff, I think."
36:30;36:34;"One way is to be, like, depressed and be like, ""Man, what a bummer."
36:34;36:37;"It's like the big songs get so much more play than the other ones."""
36:37;36:40;"And like, ""Man, remember back in the day you had to go buy an album"
36:40;36:42;"and you spent time with it and you appreciated the album as an art form?"""
36:42;36:44;"That's the pessimistic view."
36:44;36:48;"The optimistic view would be like, ""Streaming services are like a record store"
36:48;36:51;"and the radio all in one."""
36:51;36:54;"So, like, back in the day, of course more people hear the single."
36:54;36:57;"It's always going to be a drop-off between the number of people who know Stairway"
36:57;37:00;"and who go buy a Led Zepp album."
37:00;37:03;"Even, like, with Drake or something, the number of people who know One Dance"
37:03;37:07;"who don't know, like, track 17 on the record."
37:07;37:08;"You know, that's--"
37:08;37:10;"No, I mean, I get that."
37:10;37:12;"But what I'm-- I guess what I'm asking is, like,"
37:12;37:16;"A-Punk is no longer a single that's in active rotation."
37:16;37:19;"Like, you're not promoting the first Vampire Weekend album."
37:19;37:23;"And when you were, Spotify wasn't really a thing, or was it?"
37:23;37:26;"No, it literally didn't exist."
37:26;37:29;"So, what accounts for that now?"
37:29;37:30;"I don't know."
37:30;37:32;"Like, is it just people watching Step Brothers?"
37:32;37:35;"I think it's literally just people watching Step Brothers."
37:35;37:39;"Or if you're not a Zeppelin person, and you're, like, typing in Zeppelin,"
37:39;37:42;"it starts to, like, feed on itself or, like, perpetuate itself."
37:42;37:43;"Yeah, so let's say--"
37:43;37:45;"So you type, you're like, ""Who's Led Zeppelin?"""
37:45;37:46;"You're 12 years old."
37:46;37:47;"Okay."
37:47;37:49;"And you're, like, ""You know what?"
37:49;37:53;"I'm no longer interested in the artificial palette of modern pop music."
37:53;37:56;"I prefer the tasteful palette of '70s hard rock."""
37:56;37:57;"I've been listening to Time Crisis."
37:58;38:03;"There's this middle-aged guy on the show that talks about the tasteful palette of '70s rock."
38:03;38:07;"In fact, you know, just to bring it full circle from the last episode,"
38:07;38:12;"maybe there's a kid, a 12-year-old guy, who always thought One Direction was cool."
38:12;38:14;"And he's checking out the solo work of Harry Styles."
38:14;38:17;"And then he hears this song called ""Sign of the Times,"""
38:17;38:23;"and he's like, ""Daddy, Daddy, what is this tasteful palette of this Harry Styles song?"
38:23;38:30;"It doesn't sound like the synth-driven, dance-music-influenced pop that I normally hear."""
38:30;38:38;"""Well, son, that tasteful palette is highly reminiscent of early '70s Bowie and T-Rex."""
38:38;38:39;"Maybe a little Elton John."
38:39;38:41;"Maybe a little Elton John."
38:41;38:44;"And he types in ""David Bowie."""
38:44;38:49;"Of course that kid's not going to go listen to, you know, track 8 on low."
38:49;38:50;"Quicksand."
38:50;38:52;"The first thing that's probably going to come up is like Space Oddity,"
38:52;38:56;"or whatever his most streamed song is, he's going to listen to Space Oddity and be like,"
38:56;38:58;"""Tight. I like this song."""
38:58;39:01;"And then whether he decides to dig deeper in the David Bowie catalog,"
39:01;39:09;"or maybe he'll say, ""Daddy, Daddy, I love this song Space Oddity."
39:09;39:10;"What should I do next?"""
39:10;39:15;"And the dad could either say, ""Well, son, I think you should go deep into the discography"
39:15;39:18;"of the late, great David Bowie,"" or he might say, ""You know what, son?"
39:18;39:23;"You should save that song to a playlist, and let's continue hunting for some other gems"
39:23;39:24;"with the tasteful '70s palette."""
39:24;39:25;"And then you move on."
39:37;39:44;"Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly"
39:44;39:50;"And the Spiders' Crumpons, they played it left hand"
39:50;39:56;"But made it too far, became the special man"
39:56;40:01;"For then we were Ziggy's band"
40:01;40:07;"Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo"
40:07;40:10;"Like some cat from Japan"
40:10;40:17;"He could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave 'em to hang"
40:17;40:24;"Became one so loaded man, well hung, snow white tan"
40:24;40:30;"So where were the Spiders?"
40:30;40:36;"While the fly tried to break our bones"
40:36;40:41;"Just the beer liked to guide us"
40:41;40:47;"So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?"
40:48;40:51;"(Guitar solo)"
40:51;41:07;"Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo"
41:07;41:13;"The kids were just grass, he was the nest"
41:13;41:19;"With God-given ass, he took it all too far"
41:19;41:24;"But boy, could he play guitar"
41:24;41:30;"Making love with his ego"
41:30;41:36;"Ziggy sucked up into his mind"
41:36;41:40;"Like a leper messiah"
41:40;41:46;"When the kids had killed a man, I had to bring up the band"
41:46;41:49;"(Guitar solo)"
41:49;42:00;"Oh yeah"
42:00;42:06;"Ooh"
42:09;42:18;"Ziggy played guitar"
42:18;42:26;"Time Crisis with Ezra King"
42:26;42:30;"Beats 1"
42:30;42:32;"So Jake, this news already broke"
42:32;42:36;"But we would be remiss not to mention on Time Crisis"
42:36;42:39;"(Laughter)"
42:39;42:41;"How are those tortilla chips?"
42:41;42:42;"Great"
42:42;42:44;"Washing it down with a Modelo"
42:44;42:47;"Love your brand loyalty with Modelo"
42:47;42:48;"It's a good beer"
42:48;42:49;"Great beer"
42:49;42:55;"But anyway, Doritos teamed up with Marvel Studios to promote Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 in an unusual way"
42:55;42:58;"They've created a custom designed limited edition series of Doritos bags"
42:58;43:02;"With a built in rechargeable cassette deck inspired player"
43:02;43:04;"That plays the movie's full soundtrack"
43:04;43:06;"Cassette deck inspired"
43:06;43:08;"Basically it's like a little"
43:08;43:09;"Piece of plastic"
43:09;43:14;"A little piece of plastic with a little hard drive in it that has mp3's of these songs and it looks like a cassette deck"
43:14;43:17;"And so there's speakers built into the bag?"
43:17;43:20;"I think maybe there's a eighth inch jack"
43:20;43:22;"You plug in your earbuds"
43:22;43:24;"You can plug your earbuds in"
43:24;43:26;"Oh it comes with headphones"
43:26;43:29;"Oh it comes with kind of like 80's looking headphones"
43:29;43:35;"The Time Crisis social media presence went off the rails with this news"
43:35;43:38;"Cause it was like the fusion of Doritos"
43:38;43:39;"Music"
43:39;43:40;"And classic rock really"
43:40;43:44;"Cause it's like all 70's like top 40 stuff right?"
43:44;43:45;"Yeah exactly"
43:45;43:47;"Like stuff we might hear in the top 5 if we were doing"
43:47;43:51;"1973 you know top 5"
43:51;43:53;"Exactly cause in the film"
43:53;43:54;"Well I saw the first one"
43:54;43:57;"Chris Pratt is a boy abducted from Earth at a young age"
43:57;43:58;"I saw it too"
43:58;44:00;"The way that he remembers Earth is with the beloved mixtape"
44:00;44:01;"Right"
44:01;44:03;"But he wasn't abducted from the 70's right?"
44:03;44:05;"He just had like an oldies tape"
44:05;44:08;"No I think he was abducted from like maybe the 80's"
44:08;44:09;"Oh really? Okay"
44:09;44:11;"You know cause it's like he's a kid"
44:11;44:13;"Why do you build me up?"
44:13;44:14;"Yeah exactly"
44:14;44:15;"And he gets taken"
44:15;44:17;"And then he's all grown up"
44:17;44:21;"So it'd be like if you got abducted from a baseball card store"
44:21;44:23;"When you were 12"
44:23;44:24;"Right"
44:24;44:27;"And all you had was like a Don Mattingly baseball card"
44:27;44:29;"And like a Motley Crue tape"
44:29;44:35;"And a Motley Crue tape you'd be blasting that as you cruise the interstellar speedways"
44:35;44:53;"You know when people talk about like your desert island discs"
44:53;44:54;"Yeah"
44:54;44:55;"I'm just always like"
44:56;44:57;"What's the one record?"
44:57;44:58;"God"
44:58;45:00;"I'd be like whatever record I took I would hate"
45:00;45:02;"Right within like a month"
45:02;45:04;"Or a week"
45:04;45:06;"Especially cause you'd be listening to this record and you'd be like"
45:06;45:09;"I'm stranded on this island I'm gonna die here"
45:09;45:13;"This is the soundtrack of my misery and solitude and imminent death"
45:13;45:19;"You'd probably use the record to like kill an animal or something"
45:19;45:21;"Right?"
45:21;45:25;"You'd probably try to like start a fire by like reflecting the sun rays"
45:25;45:26;"Yeah"
45:26;45:28;"Onto some like bark shaving"
45:28;45:32;"You'd like have a gaping wound on your hand"
45:32;45:34;"Melt the vinyl into it"
45:34;45:37;"You'd have a record player on the island"
45:37;45:42;"Oh yeah that record player would be getting stripped for parts immediately"
45:42;45:43;"Yeah"
45:43;45:45;"Desert island disc"
45:45;45:47;"Honestly if I was stranded on a desert island"
45:47;45:52;"I'd rather simply have a hacky sack than any record that's ever been made"
45:52;45:53;"Tight call"
45:53;45:56;"At least I'd be something to do get really good at hacky sack"
45:56;45:59;"Yeah I think having one record"
45:59;46:04;"Oh my god it would just like make the passing of time so profound"
46:04;46:07;"Like you'd listen to this record it's like 42 minutes long"
46:07;46:11;"You'd be like well I listened to it it's 42 minutes later"
46:11;46:14;"I'm gonna be here for the next 40 years"
46:14;46:15;"Ugh"
46:15;46:18;"I'll listen to it again maybe later today"
46:18;46:22;"And waste another 42 minutes of my life when I could be like trying to like"
46:22;46:23;"Yeah like we"
46:23;46:24;"Hunt some wild boar down"
46:24;46:27;"People get all like excited about this stuff just like"
46:27;46:29;"You really think 30 years deep"
46:29;46:32;"You're just gonna be so happy"
46:32;46:33;"That you have Dark Side of the Moon"
46:33;46:34;"Yeah"
46:34;46:35;"To listen to"
46:35;46:37;"Thank god I have Alien Lanes"
46:37;46:40;"So I can listen to Game of Pricks over and over again"
46:40;46:41;"While I'm starving"
46:41;46:47;"I've waited too long to have you right in the back of me"
46:47;46:49;"But she didn't sit down"
46:49;46:53;"I wonder how you keep track of me"
46:53;46:57;"You could never be strong"
46:57;47:00;"You could only be free"
47:00;47:02;"And I never asked for the truth"
47:02;47:07;"But you had a lot to me"
47:07;47:13;"I'll get to the game by the tricks of real life's little back of me"
47:13;47:16;"Can't call you without you"
47:16;47:19;"I don't blame you for attacking me"
47:19;47:23;"I'm down in hell"
47:23;47:26;"Weep to all of the trees"
47:26;47:29;"And when you come calling me down"
47:29;47:32;"I don't have my disease"
47:33;47:44;"(Guitar Solo)"
47:44;47:48;"You could never be strong"
47:48;47:51;"You could only be free"
47:51;47:53;"And I never asked for the truth"
47:53;47:57;"But you had a lot to me"
47:57;47:59;"And I never asked for the truth"
47:59;48:03;"But you had a lot to me"
48:03;48:05;"And I never asked for the truth"
48:05;48:10;"But you had a lot to me"
48:10;48:12;"I guess something you could dance to would be kind of fun"
48:12;48:13;"But also like"
48:13;48:14;"Solo dancing?"
48:14;48:18;"I'd rather have like a workout tape"
48:18;48:22;"I guess it'd be kind of cool if you could take like a Django Reinhardt record"
48:22;48:24;"And you got a guitar"
48:24;48:25;"Jam to it?"
48:25;48:26;"Then there's something you could do"
48:26;48:27;"You'd try to learn the parts"
48:27;48:29;"Or at least an activity"
48:29;48:30;"Okay"
48:30;48:37;"(Guitar Solo)"
48:37;48:39;"Would you rather have"
48:39;48:41;"Like a Playstation"
48:41;48:43;"With 50 games"
48:43;48:45;"Or"
48:45;48:47;"A lifetime supply of Modellos"
48:47;48:49;"Cold?"
48:49;48:51;"Yeah, let's say there's kind of like a magical fridge"
48:51;48:55;"And every time you reach in there's an ice cold Modello"
48:55;48:57;"So basically 30 years alone"
48:57;48:59;"Pounding Modellos"
48:59;49:01;"Or no Modellos"
49:01;49:03;"But you can play like"
49:03;49:05;"That's a tough call"
49:05;49:06;"You can play like Madden"
49:06;49:08;"I'm not a video games guy at all"
49:08;49:10;"But those are like worlds to explore"
49:10;49:11;"No I know I mean if you were"
49:11;49:13;"You might get into some like RPGs"
49:13;49:14;"Persona 5"
49:14;49:17;"If you were on an island by yourself for decades"
49:17;49:19;"The time"
49:19;49:21;"Oh my god"
49:21;49:23;"I mean my instinct was to say Modellos"
49:23;49:25;"That's the wrong move"
49:25;49:27;"Yeah the video games I think would help pass the time better"
49:27;49:29;"Yeah I think so"
49:29;49:30;"Kind of messed up though right?"
49:30;49:32;"Like you're on this like desert island"
49:32;49:34;"And you're just playing video games all day"
49:34;49:36;"(Laughter)"
49:36;49:37;"See maybe I'd take the Modellos"
49:37;49:40;"Because I'd have to be working all day just to live"
49:40;49:43;"I'd have to be like scavenging coconuts"
49:43;49:45;"Amassing firewood to build"
49:45;49:47;"Shoring up my shelter"
49:47;49:50;"Trying to build a raft to like get the hell off the island"
49:50;49:52;"Maybe I'm looking at this through a very modern perspective"
49:52;49:54;"You know trying to hunt a boar"
49:54;49:57;"I'm so used to growing up in first world America"
49:57;50:01;"Where everybody has at least a tiny bit of free time"
50:01;50:02;"Yeah"
50:02;50:05;"Because even if you're like got a brutal life"
50:05;50:07;"And you have to work so many jobs to keep afloat"
50:07;50:10;"You still have like an odd day off"
50:10;50:12;"There still is a sense of leisure time"
50:12;50:15;"Whereas when people were like scavengers"
50:15;50:17;"No but even then you know"
50:17;50:20;"When scientists imagine what the hunter gatherer societies were like"
50:20;50:21;"Sure"
50:21;50:25;"They actually say that there was a more chill time to be alive"
50:25;50:27;"Than in the agrarian era"
50:27;50:28;"You know what I mean?"
50:28;50:29;"Right I've heard that theory"
50:29;50:34;"You're rolling around with 30 of your closest friends and family"
50:34;50:38;"You guys come across a bunch of fruit trees"
50:38;50:40;"What do you do?"
50:40;50:42;"You sit down, you shoot the sh*t"
50:42;50:45;"Eat some delicious mangoes and you move on"
50:45;50:48;"As opposed to the agrarian societies where you gotta till the earth"
50:48;50:49;"Right"
50:49;50:50;"Non-stop"
50:50;50:51;"You're working"
50:51;50:54;"Well okay but if you don't find the mangoes or the wild boar"
50:54;50:57;"Then you're screwed"
50:57;51:02;"You need the medellos to go with the wild boar"
51:02;51:04;"That's what I'm thinking"
51:04;51:07;"Right you get really good at hunting"
51:07;51:10;"You're barbecuing like seagulls"
51:10;51:13;"And you're just like good lord I wish I could watch this out on the modelo"
51:13;51:16;"That might also help if the food was real nasty"
51:16;51:17;"Yeah"
51:17;51:20;"Cause you might not have access to salsas"
51:20;51:24;"Or if you are starving the beers are a carb load"
51:24;51:25;"Yeah that's true"
51:25;51:26;"Okay"
51:26;51:27;"You've really fleshed that out"
51:27;51:28;"Alright so we got it"
51:28;51:31;"If ever an evil billionaire tells you"
51:31;51:32;"To pick your favorite record"
51:32;51:36;"Cause you're about to go live on an island by yourself for the rest of your life"
51:36;51:38;"Just try to bargain"
51:38;51:42;"How about a fridge full of ice cold medellos?"
51:42;51:44;"Lifetime supply"
51:44;51:46;"Desert Island Discs"
51:46;51:49;"Honestly even just thinking about it stresses me out"
51:49;51:52;"I really know how it feels to be"
51:52;51:54;"Stressed out stressed out"
51:54;51:59;"When you're face to face with your adversities"
51:59;52:02;"I really know how it feels to be"
52:02;52:04;"Stressed out stressed out"
52:04;52:09;"We're gonna make this thing work out eventually"
52:09;52:12;"Yo I ain't one to complain but this thing's in the game"
52:12;52:13;"What's your name?"
52:13;52:15;"Consequence I'm tight burnt like flames"
52:15;52:16;"And why's that?"
52:16;52:18;"American dream they got this ghetto kid in a fiend"
52:18;52:20;"Don't stress that cause it's not in your bloodstream"
52:20;52:22;"Your whole being comes from greatness"
52:22;52:25;"You remember Chase Long got you caught in the storms of December"
52:25;52:28;"And brothers on the block packing 9's like September"
52:28;52:30;"Change these situations you get in the sparkers or slender"
52:30;52:33;"Yo I be on the avenue where they be acting brand new"
52:33;52:35;"I'm sludging on these re-blocked joints for sure they boom"
52:35;52:38;"All of a sudden I saw these two kids twerking"
52:38;52:40;"Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nothing"
52:40;52:43;"My hand was on my pulley they was acting unruly"
52:43;52:45;"Yo word up yo I was tight caught up"
52:45;52:48;"But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride"
52:48;52:50;"Because the positive it seems that negative died"
52:50;52:53;"Yeah we was at the dice game making these cash with Trillie"
52:53;52:56;"Flaming steady running off at the willy"

53:11;53:14;"And I was doing it till I met Ice Spike and Mike Monroe"
53:14;53:16;"They had my pockets so the other end spiked"
53:16;53:19;"Yo I know the feeling when you feeling like you feeling"
53:19;53:21;"You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealing"
53:21;53:24;"And the stresses of life can take you off the right path"
53:24;53:26;"Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff"
53:26;53:29;"We gotta hold the dance so we can move on past"
53:29;53:31;"All adversities so we can get through fast"
53:31;53:36;"I really know how it feels to be stressed out"

54:08;54:11;"For switch hittin' queens, lickin' liquid sauce spittin'"
54:11;54:13;"With raw puppies and now your first love is quills"
54:13;54:15;"Your vision of the mills got crushed like hay lover"
54:15;54:18;"Try to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover"
54:18;54:21;"And all I want is my laceration of the pie"
54:21;54:23;"To get this whip cream before the water runs dry"
54:23;54:26;"Chicken's last dancing yo I don't know why"
54:26;54:28;"Your chicken snitchin', she got you cruisin' to the pokey"

54:46;54:48;"Stressed out, stressed out"
54:48;54:52;"When you're face to face with your adversity"
54:52;54:54;"With your adversity"
54:54;54:56;"I really know how it feels to be"
54:56;54:58;"I know how stressed out"
54:58;55:02;"We're gonna make this thing work out eventually"
55:02;55:06;"Oh, no way we gonna make it"
55:06;55:07;"Gonna make it"

55:10;55:11;"No way we gonna make it"
55:11;55:12;"Gonna make it"
55:12;55:14;"We gonna make it"
55:14;55:15;"Gotta make it"
55:15;55:16;"No way we gonna make it"
55:16;55:18;"Gonna make it"
55:18;55:19;"We're gonna make it"
55:19;55:21;"No way we gonna make it"
55:21;55:23;"We're gonna make it"
55:23;55:24;"We're gonna make it"
55:24;55:27;"Oh, no way we gonna make it"
55:27;55:29;"Oh, no way we gonna make it"
55:29;55:30;"Gonna make it"
55:30;55:32;"No way we gonna make it"
55:32;55:34;"Oh, no way we gonna make it"
55:34;55:37;"Oh, no way we gonna make it"
55:37;55:39;"Oh, no way we gonna make it"
55:39;55:40;"We're gonna make it"
55:40;55:42;"No way we gonna make it"
55:42;55:43;"Yeah"
55:43;55:44;"We're gonna make it"
55:44;55:45;"Yeah"
55:45;55:47;"No way we gonna make it"
55:47;55:48;"We're gonna make it"
55:49;55:51;"We're gonna make it"
55:51;55:52;"We're gonna make it"
55:52;55:53;"Oh, yeah"
55:53;55:55;"No way we gonna make it"
55:55;55:56;"We're gonna make it"
55:56;55:58;"Let's get in the top five"
55:58;56:01;"It's time for the top five"
56:01;56:03;"F-F-F-F-F-F-Five"
56:03;56:05;"On iTunes"
56:05;56:07;"Alright, Jake, so this week on the top five"
56:07;56:09;"We're taking it back to 1976"
56:09;56:10;"Wooo!"
56:10;56:14;"We're gonna compare the top five songs on iTunes today"
56:14;56:16;"To the top five Billboard hits of 1976"
56:16;56:18;"Why? Why 1976?"
56:18;56:19;"Bicentennial year?"
56:19;56:21;"No, far from it"
56:21;56:23;"The year before I was born"
56:23;56:24;"Well, kind of"
56:24;56:25;"The year I was conceived"
56:25;56:27;"The year Jake was conceived"
56:27;56:29;"And also the year that Ja Rule was born"
56:29;56:30;"Oh!"
56:30;56:32;"Ja Rule has been in the news the past couple weeks a lot"
56:32;56:37;"Because he helped start a festival called Fire"
56:37;56:38;"Right"
56:38;56:39;"That was down in the Bahamas"
56:39;56:40;"Went south"
56:40;56:41;"It didn't turn out well"
56:41;56:42;"That's been well covered"
56:42;56:43;"Yep"
56:43;56:44;"In the media"
56:44;56:45;"We're not gonna add insult to injury"
56:45;56:47;"So actually we wanna celebrate Ja Rule"
56:47;56:50;"By remembering that he was born"
56:50;56:51;"I didn't really follow this"
56:51;56:52;"41 years ago"
56:52;56:53;"Really follow the story"
56:53;56:55;"Was it incompetence or a scam?"
56:55;56:59;"And I could be talking about Trump here too"
56:59;57:01;"I know, that's like one of the big questions in life"
57:01;57:02;"Everyday there's something you look at"
57:02;57:04;"And you're like, is this incompetence or a scam?"
57:04;57:08;"I didn't actually ever click on an article about that festival consciously"
57:08;57:11;"So I only got the periphery of the story"
57:11;57:13;"Let's say gross incompetence is probably closer"
57:13;57:14;"Okay"
57:14;57:16;"Because it's not really a scam"
57:16;57:19;"Because these dudes are getting lawsuits"
57:19;57:20;"Like they're getting sued"
57:20;57:21;"Yeah, if it was a scam"
57:21;57:23;"They would have had to make it slightly nicer"
57:23;57:24;"Right"
57:24;57:26;"Then people would have been merely disappointed"
57:26;57:28;"Not outraged and scared"
57:28;57:30;"You're not disappointed"
57:30;57:32;"What was that?"
57:32;57:34;"I don't know, like bad Trump impression?"
57:34;57:36;"The number 5 song"
57:36;57:39;"This week in 1976"
57:39;57:41;"Wings"
57:41;57:43;"The post Beatles band"
57:43;57:45;"Love it"
57:45;57:46;"Paul McCartney"
57:46;57:48;"I know this song, it's called Silly Love Songs"
57:48;57:49;"Oh God"
57:53;57:55;"Tribute beginning dude"
57:55;57:57;"That's kind of interesting for 1976"
57:57;57:58;"Kind of like Nine Inch Nails"
57:58;58:00;"Yeah, it sounds like weird sampled"
58:00;58:10;"So, my understanding is that when this song came out"
58:10;58:12;"It was a huge hit for him"
58:12;58:14;"And this was kind of like when people were like"
58:14;58:16;"You know what Paul man"
58:16;58:18;"You've always been like a corn ball"
58:18;58:20;"You sold out"
58:20;58:23;"What happened to the guy who wrote When I'm 64?"
58:23;58:25;"Wait, that's exactly, no, I mean"
58:25;58:27;"No, I'm just kidding"
58:27;58:29;"I'm just saying because the Beatles had so much like"
58:29;58:31;"The guy that wrote Hey Jude or whatever"
58:31;58:34;"The guy that played drums on Tomorrow Never Knows"
58:34;58:38;"What happened to the guy who wrote Maxwell's Silver Hammer?"
58:38;58:40;"I'm still here"
58:40;58:47;"Again"
58:49;58:53;"Kind of like a little bit of a disco vibe here"
58:53;58:55;"Yeah, it's a light disco"
58:55;58:58;"I'm loving the bass playing, I wonder if that's Paul"
58:58;59:00;"Oh yeah, great bass player"
59:00;59:02;"I guess around this time"
59:02;59:04;"John Lennon was"
59:04;59:08;"Getting faced with Harry Nilsson at the Troubadour"
59:08;59:09;"Right"
59:09;59:11;"Oh, this is interesting"
59:11;59:14;"So apparently this song was written as a rebuttal to both music critics"
59:14;59:18;"And John Lennon who accused McCartney of writing lightweight love songs"
59:18;59:20;"So this song is self-aware"
59:20;59:22;"Because he's saying"
59:22;59:25;"You'd think people would have had enough of silly love songs"
59:25;59:26;"But what's wrong with that?"
59:26;59:27;"What's wrong with that?"
59:27;59:29;"I gotta say, there's something"
59:29;59:30;"It's a pretty weak song"
59:30;59:32;"It's a weak song"
59:32;59:34;"But there's"
59:34;59:36;"There's something kind of hilarious about like"
59:36;59:38;"Maybe he and John got together"
59:38;59:40;"And John was like"
59:40;59:43;"We've debated his song Imagine on this show before"
59:43;59:45;"Whether or not Imagine is like truly a deep song"
59:45;59:48;"But John's like, what happened to you man?"
59:48;59:50;"You're a cornball"
59:50;59:52;"You know, I'm writing songs like Imagine"
59:52;59:54;"Mind games"
59:54;59:56;"Jealous guy"
59:56;59:57;"What are you writing?"
59:57;59:59;"Bunch of silly love songs"
59:59;01:00:01;"And Paul's like, okay man"
01:00:01;01:00:02;"And then he writes this song"
01:00:02;01:00:03;"Oh yeah?"
01:00:03;01:00:04;"I write silly love songs?"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"Well what's wrong with that?"
01:00:06;01:00:09;"And here I go again"
01:00:09;01:00:14;"Now I'm gonna write self-aware, semi-ironic love songs"
01:00:14;01:00:15;"Is that gonna please you?"
01:00:15;01:00:16;"You cynical f-"
01:00:16;01:00:19;"When Paul McCartney sings Here I Go Again"
01:00:19;01:00:23;"I just picture him on like a cute little roller coaster"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"With Linda at his side"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"Just like looking at John scowling at him"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"Just like two middle fingers in the air"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"Here I go again"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"Boom boom boom boom"
01:00:33;01:00:38;"I love you"
01:00:40;01:00:46;"I love you"
01:00:46;01:00:54;"I love you"
01:00:54;01:01:01;"I can't explain the feelings between us"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"Now can't you see?"
01:01:03;01:01:09;"She gave me more, she gave it all to me"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"Now can't you see?"
01:01:11;01:01:15;"What's wrong with that?"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"I need to know"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"Yeah this is the part where it's kinda dark"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"Two middle fingers in the air, f- you John"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"Eat it, Lennon"
01:01:23;01:01:27;"Again"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"Ah, and then he turns to Linda"
01:01:29;01:01:32;"I love you"
01:01:32;01:01:33;"Oh you know what it is?"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"It's like they're at the water park"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"And he's going up in the log flume"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"And Lennon's on the bridge"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"Just like looking at him just like"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"You f-ing sappy dude"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"What happened to you?"
01:01:45;01:01:46;"And then he's like here I go again"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"And then like John Lennon gets splashed with the water"
01:01:48;01:01:49;"And then he turns to Linda"
01:01:49;01:01:51;"I love you"
01:01:51;01:01:53;"Like Lennon just like scowling"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"Granny glasses get knocked off"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"Dripping"
01:01:57;01:01:59;"Eat it, Lennon"
01:01:59;01:02:01;"Almost any time"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"You look back at history and like"
01:02:03;01:02:05;"I mean we've talked about this a million times"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"But it's like when I was like 13"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"Like a smarmy little 13 year old"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"And I loved the Beatles I'd just be like"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"The Lennon songs are far superior"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"And then it's like you look back and you're like"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"Is I Am The Walrus"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"Like that much better than yesterday?"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"Is Strawberry Fields Forever that much better than"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"Yesterday? I mean I don't know"
01:02:23;01:02:27;"No yeah I hear what you're saying"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"I'm stalling because they're different eras"
01:02:29;01:02:31;"Right"
01:02:31;01:02:33;"The question would be is Strawberry Fields better than Penny Lane?"
01:02:33;01:02:35;"Yes and"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"I used to feel very strong that Strawberry Fields Forever"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"Was so much deeper"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"And as I get older I'm like"
01:02:41;01:02:43;"Penny Lane there is a"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"Yeah that song was tight man"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"Barber taking"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"Photographs"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"And then you get older and you're just like honestly"
01:02:51;01:02:53;"The Kinks, Ray Davies is better than both of them"
01:02:53;01:02:57;"No they're all good"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"The number 5 song"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"In our era"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"We've been hearing this one a lot"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"Ay, ay, ay"
01:03:05;01:03:09;"Tom York's favorite song"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"Is Bruno more of a Paul or a John?"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"He's more of a Paul right?"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"Bruno's much more of a Paul"
01:03:15;01:03:17;"And I'll tell you why"
01:03:17;01:03:21;"Paul and Bruno are both like"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"Incredibly technically talented songwriters"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"Right"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"And I bet if you said to them"
01:03:27;01:03:29;"Because we talked last time about how Bruno"
01:03:29;01:03:31;"And Tom York from Radiohead have beef"
01:03:31;01:03:33;"And you know probably similarly to like"
01:03:33;01:03:35;"Paul and John"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"I bet they're the type of dudes that"
01:03:37;01:03:39;"There's some kind of distance between them as people"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"And the voice of the songs they write"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"Yeah"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"So I bet if you said to Bruno"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"Or Paul"
01:03:47;01:03:49;"You guys' songs are kind of lightweight"
01:03:49;01:03:51;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"They'd be like oh you want me to write a Radiohead"
01:03:53;01:03:55;"John Lennon song? Give me 5 minutes"
01:03:55;01:03:57;"And they would sit down at the piano"
01:03:57;01:03:59;"And write something that sounded kind of close"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"I'm not saying it'd be as good"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"But something that kind of close and be like"
01:04:03;01:04:05;"Oh yeah Radiohead, like Bruno Mars would probably be like"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"They always do this type of chord, the drums sound like this"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"And he'd sing, and I bet Bruno could do a sick Tom York impression"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"Oh my god"
01:04:11;01:04:13;"And he'd probably be, and the lyrics are always like"
01:04:13;01:04:15;"Plan the shot, like you know"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"So in that sense they're like"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"They're both razzle dazzle showmen"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"Yeah"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"I witness this all the time in the music industry"
01:04:23;01:04:25;"There's always a tension between the razzle dazzle showmen"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"And who they perceive to be like the"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"Authentic"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"The authentic serious dudes"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"Because the razzle dazzle dudes look at the authentic dudes"
01:04:33;01:04:35;"And say like"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"I'm more talented than you"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"I can do what you do but you can't do what I do"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"I can bang out a Radiohead song but you can't make a"
01:04:41;01:04:43;"That's what I like"
01:04:43;01:04:45;"And then the authentic dudes are like you guys are cornballs"
01:04:45;01:04:47;"You guys are so corny"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"Which is not as strong an argument"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"You know it'd be interesting if Radiohead did"
01:04:51;01:04:53;"Try to go pop?"
01:04:53;01:04:55;"Like if they just went with like full"
01:04:55;01:04:57;"Bruno Mars production"
01:04:57;01:04:59;"But wrote songs over that"
01:04:59;01:05:01;"It wouldn't"
01:05:01;01:05:03;"Maybe that Radiohead would be like a Tom York solo record"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"Yeah, I'd like to see him get in the booth"
01:05:05;01:05:07;"And Bruno"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"The number four song in 1976"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"Elvin Bishop"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"Oh sweet"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"A fool, a fell, oh wait what is it"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"A fooled around and fell in love"
01:05:17;01:05:19;"Fooled around and fell in love"
01:05:21;01:05:23;"Featuring the Boogie Nights"
01:05:25;01:05:35;"May 1976"
01:05:35;01:05:37;"This is what's on the radio"
01:05:37;01:05:39;"America is about to turn 200"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"I must have been through"
01:05:43;01:05:45;"About a million girls"
01:05:45;01:05:47;"Now Elvin does not sing"
01:05:47;01:05:49;"Lead vocals"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"This is his background singer"
01:05:51;01:05:53;"Mickey Thomas who went on to become"
01:05:53;01:05:55;"The lead singer of Jefferson Starship"
01:05:55;01:05:57;"Okay"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"I didn't care how much they cried"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"No sir"
01:06:01;01:06:03;"Yeah I've seen Boogie Nights"
01:06:03;01:06:05;"So many times that I can't separate"
01:06:05;01:06:07;"This song out"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"It's a scene"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"Where Philip Seymour Hoffman is just like"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"Shoving wedding cake into his mouth"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"And it's when like Becky Barnett"
01:06:15;01:06:17;"Is marrying the guy that works at the Pep Boys"
01:06:17;01:06:19;"And John C. Reilly is like"
01:06:19;01:06:21;"We're losing these two"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"Oh yeah"
01:06:23;01:06:25;"It's an initial scene"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"I mean what else can you say about this song"
01:06:27;01:06:29;"Nice 70's"
01:06:29;01:06:31;"Mellow pop soul"
01:06:31;01:06:33;"The number 4 song"
01:06:33;01:06:35;"On iTunes right now"
01:06:35;01:06:37;"This is the one that really has legs"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"Jake can you name it in the first 5 seconds"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"What is it"
01:06:43;01:06:45;"Coldplay and Chainsmoke"
01:06:45;01:06:47;"Coldplay and Chainsmokers"
01:06:47;01:06:49;"Chainsmokers and Coldplay"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"Get the order right"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"I've been reading books of old"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"The legends and the myths"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"I'm glad it's back in the top 5"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"You can't keep a song like this down"
01:06:59;01:07:01;"Dude between this and the Bruno"
01:07:01;01:07:03;"We're off to a great start here"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"Clearly I don't see myself"
01:07:05;01:07:07;"At home at risk"
01:07:07;01:07:09;"She said where'd you wanna go"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"How much you wanna risk"
01:07:11;01:07:13;"I'm not looking for somebody"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"With some superhuman gifts"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"Some superhero"
01:07:19;01:07:21;"Some fairy tidbits"
01:07:21;01:07:23;"Just something I can tell to"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"Somebody I can kiss"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"Hold on listen to this"
01:07:27;01:07:29;"As of this week"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"The Chainsmokers have had a top 10 song"
01:07:31;01:07:33;"For an entire year straight"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"So that means"
01:07:35;01:07:37;"A week has not gone by in the past year"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"When the Chainsmokers were not in the top 10"
01:07:39;01:07:41;"And I feel like"
01:07:41;01:07:43;"Even every single episode"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"That we've done of this show"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"Just about"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"I mean I could say yeah"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"More or less top 5"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"They're major artists"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"So you know what's funny"
01:07:55;01:07:57;"We've probably listened to like"
01:07:57;01:07:59;"3 hours total of Chainsmokers on this show"
01:07:59;01:08:01;"A lot of Chainsmokers"
01:08:01;01:08:03;"Also you know what's funny"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"Remember when Coldplay came out"
01:08:05;01:08:07;"They were kind of seen as like"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"Are they the heirs to Radiohead in some ways"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"Kind of similar epic rock style"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"And then as time went on"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"Radiohead went further left and more electronic"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"And Coldplay became"
01:08:17;01:08:19;"More of a considered pop artist"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"It would have been even funnier"
01:08:21;01:08:23;"If at that Radiohead show"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"This one came on"
01:08:25;01:08:27;"Just like Tom Jorkens"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"I want something just like"
01:08:29;01:08:31;"Oh f***"
01:08:31;01:08:35;"It would have been much more confusing"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"Right"
01:08:37;01:08:39;"I want something just like"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"You're talking about could Radiohead work over Bruno Mars production"
01:08:41;01:08:43;"Well"
01:08:43;01:08:45;"Chris Martin works over Chainsmokers production so why not"
01:08:45;01:08:47;"I wonder how many times Chris Martin and Tom Jork have interacted"
01:08:47;01:08:51;"That's a great question"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"And"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"You're gonna say above 10 or under 10"
01:08:55;01:08:57;"They both spend time in LA"
01:08:57;01:08:59;"I've seen both of them out and about"
01:08:59;01:09:01;"In Los Angeles"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"You think over 10 or under 10"
01:09:05;01:09:07;"Chris nice to meet you Tom"
01:09:07;01:09:09;"I've just been dying to meet you"
01:09:09;01:09:11;"God I don't even want to like play this out"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"I can picture their interaction so well"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"It hurts my feelings"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"It hurts your feelings?"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"It hurts my feelings"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"Or like you're bummed for Chris"
01:09:21;01:09:23;"It hurts all my feelings"
01:09:23;01:09:25;"Too painful to play out"
01:09:25;01:09:27;"I just feel like"
01:09:27;01:09:29;"That's a time crisis first"
01:09:29;01:09:31;"I really do respect both of those"
01:09:31;01:09:33;"Guys as songwriters"
01:09:33;01:09:35;"I think they've both written incredible songs"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"Sure"
01:09:37;01:09:39;"It's that duality that we talked about"
01:09:39;01:09:41;"It's that Lennon-McCartney"
01:09:41;01:09:43;"Like I'm sure that Tom Jork"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"Probably thinks like"
01:09:45;01:09:47;"We've gone deeper into the human psyche"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"And blah blah and Chris Martin's like"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"Yeah but you never wrote something just like this"
01:09:51;01:09:53;"It'd be an amazing"
01:09:53;01:09:55;"Like one act play"
01:09:55;01:09:57;"Like Frost/Nixon"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"Jork/Martin"
01:09:59;01:10:01;"If you're like a good playwright"
01:10:01;01:10:03;"Really delve into like"
01:10:03;01:10:05;"Notions of like artistic authenticity"
01:10:05;01:10:07;"And voice"
01:10:07;01:10:09;"How much of that is real"
01:10:09;01:10:11;"How much of that is just like"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"Kind of BS"
01:10:13;01:10:15;"And just kind of circumstance"
01:10:15;01:10:17;"And timing"
01:10:17;01:10:19;"Man I would love that just to get into that"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"Just have two artists come together"
01:10:21;01:10:23;"And just talk about like"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"Artistic intent"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"But also get into some of that stuff that's like"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"You know what man"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"At the 2001 Brit Awards"
01:10:31;01:10:33;"All I said was hi"
01:10:33;01:10:35;"And you looked at me like"
01:10:35;01:10:37;"I asked you for an autograph man"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"Like what's up with that"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"Now I'm starting to play it out"
01:10:41;01:10:43;"I don't wanna"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"Okay I can't help play it out"
01:10:45;01:10:47;"At first Tom Jork is all like whatever"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"And then later"
01:10:49;01:10:51;"Chris Martin who kind of comes across as"
01:10:51;01:10:53;"A more sensitive"
01:10:53;01:10:55;"Empathic kind of guy"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"He's like the one to be like come on man just like talk to me"
01:10:57;01:10:59;"Like a human and Tom Jork's like whatever"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"And then finally Tom Jork cracks"
01:11:01;01:11:03;"And he's like"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"Alright you know what man"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"Yeah I wish the Chainsmokers would call me"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"I wish that I had a"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"Top 5 song on iTunes"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"You know like I've had the critically acclaimed"
01:11:13;01:11:15;"Edgy album like"
01:11:15;01:11:17;"Yeah you know what man I'm actually jealous of you"
01:11:17;01:11:19;"Man"
01:11:19;01:11:21;"And yeah"
01:11:21;01:11:23;"I take it out on people like Bruno Mars"
01:11:23;01:11:25;"Cause I just wanna be your friend man"
01:11:25;01:11:27;"Just the tables totally turning"
01:11:27;01:11:29;"Chris Martin's like dude"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"Come over sometime. You just have to call me man"
01:11:31;01:11:33;"I gave you my number at the 2001"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"Brit Awards"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"Colin just showed me there is one picture"
01:11:37;01:11:39;"Of them together"
01:11:39;01:11:41;"Oh my god"
01:11:41;01:11:43;"Oh man"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"It's not even really them together"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"Like they're both not looking at the camera"
01:11:47;01:11:49;"Right they might not have been talking"
01:11:49;01:11:51;"Anyway I just wanna"
01:11:51;01:11:53;"Put this out there. I gotta write this play"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"You should write this play"
01:11:55;01:11:57;"And I just also wanna put this out there"
01:11:57;01:11:59;"Actually this was an early idea we had for Time Crisis"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"Was that we were gonna bring people with beef on"
01:12:01;01:12:03;"Oh yeah"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"And kinda hash it out"
01:12:05;01:12:07;"And I think you and I are fairly good mediators"
01:12:07;01:12:09;"Let's try to get Jork and Martin on"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"I mean they're both LA residents"
01:12:11;01:12:13;"Honestly I would even say to those two guys"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"I would"
01:12:15;01:12:17;"Do you the honor"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"Of even just seating"
01:12:19;01:12:21;"Two hours to you"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"In the producers booth man"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"We'll let you guys take the mics"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"I just wanna hear what these guys talk about"
01:12:27;01:12:29;"Maybe it won't be tense. Maybe we're imagining this"
01:12:29;01:12:31;"Or you know set it up so they do the top five"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"Together. They don't have to get into"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"Like you know"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"That's hard to just get on the mic and be like you know what dude"
01:12:37;01:12:39;"Here's what I think about your music"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"But just have them do the top five"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"Oh that'd be sick. Open invitation"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"Tom, Chris"
01:12:45;01:12:47;"You got my number. You have publicist and stuff"
01:12:47;01:12:49;"You should have them you know"
01:12:49;01:12:51;"Good job. Also"
01:12:51;01:12:53;"Like"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"That's a good play. They go through the top five and by the time they get to number one"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"Just like it just gets real"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"Tom's like Chris"
01:12:59;01:13:01;"When you said that you love that Bruno Mars song"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"That hurt. You know what happened to me in Miami"
01:13:03;01:13:05;"That hurt my feelings"
01:13:07;01:13:09;"Back to 1976"
01:13:09;01:13:11;"The number three song"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"Boogie Fever by the Silvers"
01:13:13;01:13:15;"Do you know this song? I don't know"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"Boogie Fever I don't know"
01:13:19;01:13:21;"Ooh"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"Love that"
01:13:33;01:13:35;"Kind of a weird version of"
01:13:35;01:13:37;"Daytripper? Yeah"
01:13:37;01:13:39;"Boogie Fever"
01:13:41;01:13:43;"Got the boogie down"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"Boogie Fever"
01:13:47;01:13:49;"I think it's going around"
01:13:51;01:13:53;"I took my baby"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"To the driving show"
01:13:55;01:13:57;"The bassist faced the bass line"
01:13:57;01:13:59;"On Daytripper"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"Okay. That's documented"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"Today they'd be sued right? Oh yeah"
01:14:03;01:14:05;"If you're just out front with it and you're like you know what I base this on this"
01:14:05;01:14:07;"Then is it cool?"
01:14:07;01:14:09;"It depends if you have like a good"
01:14:09;01:14:11;"Relationship with them"
01:14:11;01:14:13;"Like if somebody I was"

01:14:19;01:14:21;"And I heard it and it was like"
01:14:21;01:14:23;"This? I'd be like don't even sweat it man"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"I'm gonna base"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"The single off my first album off Apunk"
01:14:27;01:14:29;"Oh you can base the bass line"
01:14:29;01:14:31;"Off"
01:14:31;01:14:33;"You just gotta. No I'm gonna base the top riff"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"Off Apunk. Is that cool?"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"Alright you just gotta play it for me"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"This song was written by Freddie Perrin"
01:14:39;01:14:41;"And Kenneth St. Louis"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"Kenneth suggested to Freddie"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"Why don't we write a song with the word boogie in it"
01:14:45;01:14:47;"It's one of the most popular words"
01:14:47;01:14:49;"Right now"
01:14:49;01:14:51;"One of the most popular words"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"Right now?"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"What would that be now?"
01:14:55;01:14:57;"I don't know. Well a couple years ago it'd be lit"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"Like right now"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"Whoa. I don't know what's"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"Well I mean Childish Gambino did that"

01:15:05;01:15:07;"Stay woke"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"Okay"

01:15:11;01:15:13;"Cuck. He said cuck"
01:15:13;01:15:15;"I mean it depends what"

01:15:17;01:15:19;"So me and Jake"
01:15:19;01:15:21;"Were just in the studio man and I was"
01:15:21;01:15:23;"Kind of coming up empty and I said like alright"
01:15:23;01:15:25;"Just throw out a major word right now"
01:15:25;01:15:27;"And Jake said cuck and that's how we wrote Cuck Fever"
01:15:27;01:15:29;"That became number one"
01:15:29;01:15:31;"It kind of became emblematic of the"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"Trump years but we're not political man"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"It's just"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"Our band is not political"
01:15:37;01:15:39;"Cuck fever"
01:15:39;01:15:41;"Cuck fever is not political man"
01:15:41;01:15:43;"Anybody could be cucked"
01:15:43;01:15:45;"It's a sign of the times man"
01:15:45;01:15:47;"It's not an alright. We're not all left"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"We're just"

01:15:51;01:15:53;"The number three song"
01:15:53;01:15:55;"Right now on iTunes"
01:15:55;01:15:57;"Remember we heard this the other day?"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"Despacito"
01:15:59;01:16:01;"Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee, Justin Bieber"
01:16:01;01:16:03;"It's the remix"
01:16:03;01:16:05;"I mean if they want to repeal healthcare that's cool man"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"I mean"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"Whatever, right down the middle"
01:16:09;01:16:11;"God"
01:16:11;01:16:13;"Come and move that in my direction"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"So thankful for that"
01:16:15;01:16:17;"Such a blessing yeah"
01:16:17;01:16:19;"Turn every situation into heaven yeah"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"Oh oh"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"You are my sunrise"
01:16:23;01:16:25;"On the darkest day"
01:16:25;01:16:27;"Got me feeling some kind of way"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"Make me want to savor every moment"
01:16:29;01:16:31;"Slowly, slowly"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"You fit me"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"Fit me tell me love how you put it on"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"Got the only key know how to turn it on"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"Okay so we got an email from"
01:16:39;01:16:41;"An Ecuador based Time Crisis fan"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"Coco Vega"
01:16:43;01:16:45;"I love that we got people listening to Ecuador"
01:16:45;01:16:47;"Yeah"
01:16:47;01:16:49;"Coco Vega explained to us that"
01:16:49;01:16:51;"Seinfeld 2000 got the translation dead wrong"
01:16:51;01:16:55;"Shots fired"
01:16:55;01:16:57;"Sorry Seinfeld"
01:16:57;01:16:59;"But maybe Despacito could be translated as"
01:16:59;01:17:01;"Thirsty in some places"
01:17:01;01:17:03;"Easy does it sounds more like it"
01:17:03;01:17:05;"Right that's what I thought we got into that a little bit"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"Take it easy"
01:17:07;01:17:09;"Or like slow right"
01:17:09;01:17:11;"Lento"
01:17:11;01:17:13;"He says in this case I think the best translation is just slowly"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"Yeah"
01:17:15;01:17:17;"Although take it easy would be good if they want to put it in English"
01:17:17;01:17:19;"Despacito"
01:17:19;01:17:21;"Take it easy"
01:17:23;01:17:25;"So this is the chorus where Despacito is used the most"
01:17:25;01:17:27;"Despacito"
01:17:27;01:17:29;"Basically this is Coco Vega's translation"
01:17:29;01:17:31;"Slowly"
01:17:31;01:17:33;"I want to breathe your neck slowly"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"Let me whisper you things in your ears"
01:17:35;01:17:37;"So that you remember when you're not with me"
01:17:37;01:17:39;"Slowly I want to strip you off with kisses slowly"
01:17:39;01:17:41;"Sign the walls of your labyrinth"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"And make your whole body a manuscript"
01:17:43;01:17:45;"What does that mean"
01:17:45;01:17:47;"Sign the walls of your labyrinth"
01:17:47;01:17:49;"It must be referring to one of the various"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"Orifices of the human body as a labyrinth"
01:17:51;01:17:53;"But how's he signing it"
01:17:53;01:17:55;"I guess you sign it by gentle contact"
01:17:55;01:17:57;"Or you sign it by"
01:17:57;01:17:59;"By gentle contact with a part of your body"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"Okay"
01:18:01;01:18:03;"I thought something else"
01:18:03;01:18:05;"In other words I think they're talking about intercourse"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"That's my read"
01:18:07;01:18:09;"I could be wrong"
01:18:09;01:18:11;"And make your whole body a manuscript"
01:18:11;01:18:13;"You need some sort of like fluid"
01:18:13;01:18:15;"To like sign things with right"
01:18:15;01:18:17;"Oh god is that really what they're saying"
01:18:17;01:18:19;"First of all"
01:18:19;01:18:21;"Shout out to Coco Vega"
01:18:21;01:18:23;"In Ecuador"
01:18:23;01:18:25;"I really appreciate this because"
01:18:25;01:18:27;"I don't know Spanish at all"
01:18:27;01:18:29;"Who am I kidding it's one of the great shams in my life"
01:18:29;01:18:31;"You took French?"
01:18:31;01:18:33;"Yeah I was such an idiot"
01:18:33;01:18:35;"That's a whack move"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"I was a little pretentious 14 year old"
01:18:37;01:18:39;"They said you want to take Spanish or French"
01:18:39;01:18:41;"And I was like I'll take French"
01:18:41;01:18:43;"It's honestly one of the dumbest things I did in my life"
01:18:43;01:18:45;"It works for you"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"Yeah"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"The same sort of like vampire weekend"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"I know well yeah this is a bad thing"
01:18:51;01:18:53;"You think of me as a pretentious little French taker"
01:18:53;01:18:55;"Well I don't but"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"The part of you that took French"
01:18:57;01:18:59;"Is the same part of you"
01:18:59;01:19:01;"Preferred the Beatles to the Stones"
01:19:01;01:19:03;"And started vampire weekend"
01:19:03;01:19:05;"That's right"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"It's a little precious"
01:19:07;01:19:09;"As I get older I get less precious"
01:19:09;01:19:11;"God love ya"
01:19:11;01:19:13;"As I get older I get less precious"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"I listen to the Stones more than the Beatles"
01:19:15;01:19:17;"You're more into exile than you are into uh"
01:19:17;01:19:19;"You know magical mystery tour"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"Exactly"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"I'm more into learning French"
01:19:23;01:19:25;"Torn and frayed bro"
01:19:25;01:19:27;"I go to the gym more"
01:19:27;01:19:29;"I drink protein shakes"
01:19:29;01:19:31;"I watch the game"
01:19:31;01:19:33;"You're listening to the Joe Rogan podcast constantly"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"I drink bone broth"
01:19:35;01:19:37;"I take human growth hormone"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"I go hunting"
01:19:39;01:19:41;"You take a nootropics"
01:19:41;01:19:43;"I take nootropics"
01:19:43;01:19:45;"I eat paleo"
01:19:45;01:19:47;"Let's face it you're a libertarian"
01:19:47;01:19:49;"I'm a libertarian"
01:19:49;01:19:51;"That's true"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"I cut the line at Starbucks"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"I stopped reading books"
01:19:55;01:19:57;"You're investing in restaurants"
01:19:57;01:19:59;"*laughter*"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"Yeah"
01:20:03;01:20:05;"What are you driving these days?"
01:20:05;01:20:07;"This is getting weirder"
01:20:07;01:20:09;"An H2 Hummer"
01:20:09;01:20:11;"Sick"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"I endorse John Kasich"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"On the show"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"Can you imagine if we had John Kasich call him"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"I'd be a star for him"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"A very sincere John Kasich interview"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"When I go over to a friend's house I bring wings"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"Nice"
01:20:25;01:20:27;"So you're getting far away from taking French"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"Well it's just more people speak Spanish"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"It's as simple as that"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"Big election today in France"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"I know that this is a big election"
01:20:35;01:20:37;"I know that a lot of things hang in the balance"
01:20:37;01:20:39;"This could be the rise of fascism"
01:20:39;01:20:41;"This and that but"
01:20:41;01:20:43;"I just don't care about French stuff anymore"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"You won't catch me watching those returns"
01:20:45;01:20:47;"Be watching the game"
01:20:47;01:20:49;"MMA bro"
01:20:49;01:20:51;"Dear lord, stop the national front"
01:20:51;01:20:53;"We'll find out"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"Anyway, back to 1976"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"Where are we?"
01:20:57;01:20:59;"Here's Maxine Nightingale with Right Back Where We Started From"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"*music*"
01:21:01;01:21:03;"Oh this is a good one"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"Yeah"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"I like this one"
01:21:07;01:21:09;"This is a re-recording"
01:21:09;01:21:11;"Oh was it a 60's song?"
01:21:11;01:21:13;"No it's from the 70's"
01:21:13;01:21:15;"From their masters"
01:21:15;01:21:17;"So we're hopefully putting a little extra money in Maxine Nightingale's pocket"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"By playing this version"
01:21:19;01:21:21;"Was this recorded like recently?"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"2005"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"Oh man, really?"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"Wow you could have fooled me"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"It's a little stiff"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"Yeah it's stiff"
01:21:31;01:21:33;"Oh yeah this does sound bad"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"Do you remember that day?"
01:21:35;01:21:37;"That sunny day"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"When you first came out of the heat"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"I said no one could take your place"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"And if you get hurt"
01:21:43;01:21:45;"By the little things I say"
01:21:45;01:21:47;"I can put that smile back on your face"
01:21:47;01:21:49;"Oh and it all"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"It's really hard to fake recordings"
01:21:51;01:21:53;"Because even if you get the players"
01:21:53;01:21:55;"It's hard to recreate that magic"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"It's so weird when people do that"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"I mean"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"I think like a lot of people"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"Do that"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"But I don't think it's a good thing"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"I don't think it's a good thing"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"I think like Pearl Jam"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"No no they didn't re-record"
01:22:13;01:22:15;"But they like remixed 10"
01:22:15;01:22:17;"Oh and it sounded weird?"
01:22:17;01:22:19;"I didn't hear the remix I wasn't interested in it"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"But I read about that that they all thought 10"
01:22:21;01:22:23;"The first record from 91"
01:22:23;01:22:25;"Sounded too like kinda butt rock"
01:22:25;01:22:27;"So they remixed it in this like kinda"
01:22:27;01:22:29;"Cooler like grungier way"
01:22:29;01:22:31;"And I know like Def Leppard re-recorded"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"Hysteria with their big album"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"They fully re-recorded it?"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"Yeah so if you actually I've looked at this on Apple Music"
01:22:37;01:22:39;"The only version of Def Leppard"
01:22:39;01:22:41;"Is the re-recorded? Is a 2012 re-record"
01:22:41;01:22:43;"And does it sound crazy to you?"
01:22:43;01:22:45;"It just sounds more souped up and less"
01:22:45;01:22:47;"I mean already that was a psychotic album"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"Yeah but like I wanna hear the original album"
01:22:49;01:22:51;"I don't wanna hear"
01:22:51;01:22:53;"It's tough yeah you get so attached to recording"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"I think ELO recorded some of their albums"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"It's like a very weird"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"Sometimes it's a move to just own your own version of the song"
01:22:59;01:23:01;"Right"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"Because sometimes people signed horrible deals back in the day"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"So maybe they"
01:23:05;01:23:07;"They're doing it?"
01:23:07;01:23:09;"That's a classic reason why"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"That's such a what an uninspired performance"
01:23:11;01:23:13;"They're like doing it for that reason"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"Pour some"
01:23:15;01:23:17;"Sugar on me"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"You're like the whole time"
01:23:19;01:23:21;"You're just thinking I gotta get my version in"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"Right"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"We gotta make that money"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"Mutt Lang screwed us or whatever"
01:23:27;01:23:29;"Next time Denny's calls"
01:23:29;01:23:31;"Looking to use pour some sugar on me"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"In a campaign my manager"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"Can hit him up and say hey guys"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"You wanna save about a hundred grand?"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"Our triple dipped french toast"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"Use the 2012 version"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"Pour some sugar"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"Come and get it on"
01:23:45;01:23:47;"Then I"
01:23:47;01:23:49;"You gotta do it like down"
01:23:49;01:23:51;"Down two steps"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"Totally pour some"
01:23:53;01:23:55;"Oh god"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"The number two song"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"Right now on iTunes"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"DJ Khaled"
01:24:01;01:24:03;"And it's not just DJ Khaled"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"Got Justin Bieber"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"Quavo, do you know who Quavo is?"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"I don't"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"He's a member of Migos, you know who Migos is?"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"I don't"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"They're a rap group from Atlanta"
01:24:15;01:24:17;"Right"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"Chance the Rapper, you know who he is?"
01:24:19;01:24:21;"Lil Wayne, you know who he is?"
01:24:21;01:24:23;"Where's Lil Wayne from?"
01:24:23;01:24:25;"New Orleans?"
01:24:25;01:24:27;"Yeah, alright"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"Look at Jake"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"Some people are saying this could be the song of the summer"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"Okay"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"We the best music"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"Another one"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"DJ Khaled"
01:24:39;01:24:41;"Yeah, yeah, looking at the truth, the money never lie"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"No, I'm the one, yeah"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"I'm the one"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"Early morning in the dark, know you wanna ride"
01:24:47;01:24:49;"Is this Justin? Yeah"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"I'm the one, yeah"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"Hear you sick of all those other imitators"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"Don't let the only real one intimidate ya"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"See you watching, don't run out of time"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"I'm the one, yeah"
01:25:03;01:25:05;"I'm the one"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"I'm the only one"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"I'm the one"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"I'm the only one"
01:25:13;01:25:15;"I'm the one, yeah"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"I'm the one that hit that same spot"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"She the one that bring them raindrops"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"We go back, remember Christmas"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"Fun, everybody does their take"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"What does it mean to be the one to you?"
01:25:25;01:25:27;"For Justin, it means one thing,"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"Quavo, something else"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"I didn't catch Justin's"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"Meaning"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"It's something about being rich"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"Or special, I don't know"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"You can ride inside my life"
01:25:39;01:25:41;"On that fame bus"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"'Cause I promise when we step out"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"You'll be famous"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"What do you think, Jake?"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"I don't know"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"You think Jake? Pretty forgettable"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"Now it's time for Jake's take"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"I'm the one, DJ Khaled"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"Song of the Summer, Contender"
01:25:57;01:25:59;"I got a hot take here"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"I got a real original hot take on"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"I'm the one, I'm a 40 year old dude"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"Never heard the song in my life"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"I got all kinds of opinions about this"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"Song of the Summer"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"Over my dead body"
01:26:11;01:26:13;"No way"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"I'm waiting for that new AC/DC album to drop"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"I don't know, sounds cool"
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Wait, Jake, what's like your"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"Attitude towards the music?"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"That's cool"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"Wait, Jake, what's like your eternal song of the summer?"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"It's like an eagle song or something?"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"No, no, you know what it is? What?"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"Nelly, It's Getting Hot in Here"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"Oh, okay"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"That's the eternal song of summer, right?"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"For the 21st century and for the 15th year in a row"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"It's Jake's Song of the Summer"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"It's getting hot in here"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"So take off all your clothes"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"I am getting so hot"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"I won't take my clothes off"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"I'm the one has some real heat"
01:26:49;01:26:51;"That sounds cool"
01:26:51;01:26:53;"It's fun, it's upbeat"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"Didn't bum me out, didn't pump me up"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Maybe it'll grow on me"
01:26:59;01:27:01;"I like that rubric"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"This one didn't bum you out"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"Nor did it pump you up"
01:27:05;01:27:07;"Some songs bum you out, but they pump you up"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"Some songs just bum you out"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"Occasionally"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"And I mean this"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"Occasionally"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"One just pumps you up"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"Does it bum you out?"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"No opinion"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"I'm pumped up, I'm not thinking about it"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"The number one song"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"This is funny"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"May 1976, the number one song was a TV theme song"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"That doesn't happen too often these days"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"Oh, Dukes of Hazzard?"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"No"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"Is it like a famous show?"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"It's a very famous show"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"It launched the career of one of our greatest actors"
01:27:41;01:27:45;"An Italian-American icon"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"John Travolta?"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"What's the show he was on?"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"Welcome Back..."
01:27:51;01:27:53;"Mr. Cotter?"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"What's the song?"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"It's called Welcome Back"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"I don't think I've ever seen a full episode of this show"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"I vaguely remember it was on Nick at Night back in the day"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"And I know that it was Mr. Cotter"
01:28:03;01:28:05;"It was the teacher"
01:28:05;01:28:07;"And these were a bunch of knuckleheads in his class"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"And John Travolta would always be"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"Hey Mr. Cotter"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"I've probably seen more parodies of it than I've ever seen the show"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"But even without listening to it"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"I know how the song goes"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"Welcome back"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"It's composed by John Sebastian"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"Who performed it?"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"Yeah, he's a famous songwriter"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"Wait"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"Was John Sebastian involved with the Mamas and Papas?"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"I think"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"Or some other band"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"Loving Spoonful"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"Oh, okay"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"This is number one?"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"People were buying like seven inches of this"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"Yeah, there used to be three channels"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"I want to go by them all"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"And I gotta pick up a shirt for work"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"And pick up the new seven inch of Welcome Back"
01:28:49;01:28:51;"Yeah"
01:28:51;01:28:55;"Culture used to be a lot more narrow"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"Maybe like"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"At the end of the episode"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"Hey, what's up guys? This is John Travolta"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"I want you to go by"
01:29:03;01:29:05;"Go to the supermarket"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"And pick up the 45"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"Of the theme from Welcome Back Cotter by John Sebastian"
01:29:09;01:29:11;"That's probably enough to make it number one"
01:29:11;01:29:13;"Travolta's a year in Scientology at this point"
01:29:13;01:29:15;"Oh, did he become a Scientologist in '75?"
01:29:15;01:29:17;"Yeah, yeah, I remember reading that"
01:29:17;01:29:19;"I remember that first"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"I'm weird with years"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"Sometimes they stick in my craw"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"Right, '75 is the year Travolta started"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"Yeah"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"Hey guys, I'm John Travolta"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"Kind of a Rennie Newman vibe a little bit, right?"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"Yeah, totally"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"It's a good song"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"If you want to go clear like me"
01:29:37;01:29:39;"You gotta pick up Welcome Back Cotter"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"Theme song"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"Along with a copy of Dianetics"
01:29:43;01:29:47;"Shout out to L. Ron Hubbard"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"And John Sebastian"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"Welcome back"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back"
01:29:53;01:29:55;"I wonder if Travolta and Hubbard"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"Had FaceTime"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"'Cause Hubbard died in like '86"
01:29:59;01:30:03;"I bet, well, no, but Hubbard was so isolated"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"Yeah, they probably had some FaceTime"
01:30:05;01:30:07;"But he was so isolated and reclusive"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"I've met somebody who met Hubbard"
01:30:09;01:30:11;"Whoa"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"We'll talk about that after the show"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"Really? You can't get into it?"
01:30:15;01:30:17;"They're gonna come after you?"
01:30:17;01:30:19;"I don't want to mess with Scientology"
01:30:19;01:30:21;"How old is this person that met Hubbard?"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"I got enough on my plate"
01:30:23;01:30:25;"In their 60s"
01:30:25;01:30:27;"Maybe 70s"
01:30:27;01:30:29;"Was it a long hang?"
01:30:29;01:30:31;"All I know is that they met"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"Next time I see this person I'm gonna ask some questions"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"I'm gonna approach in a very neutral way"
01:30:35;01:30:37;"Just like you met a famous guy"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"Same way that if you told me you met Tom York I'd ask you how it went down"
01:30:39;01:30:41;"You're listening to"
01:30:41;01:30:43;"Time Crisis"
01:30:43;01:30:45;"On Beast1"
01:30:45;01:30:47;"Jake, do you know who Nile Horan is?"
01:30:47;01:30:49;"I don't"
01:30:49;01:30:51;"Nile Horan?"
01:30:51;01:30:53;"First name N-I-A-L-L"
01:30:53;01:30:55;"Ooh"
01:30:55;01:30:57;"Nile?"
01:30:57;01:30:59;"Nope"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"British person?"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"Yes I believe he's British"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"Might be Irish"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"One of the two"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"Nile Horan"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"He's sitting atop"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"The iTunes chart right now"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"With a song called Slow Hands"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"No idea who he is"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"Asking me or telling me?"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"Oh I know who he is"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"Oh you do? Okay I have no idea"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"Never heard the name in my life"
01:31:25;01:31:27;"Well let me read you a little bit about him"
01:31:27;01:31:29;"Nile Horan is from One Direction"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"Wow"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"One Direction?"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"What happened to Harry Styles?"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"He's not in the top 5 this week"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"That's messed up"
01:31:39;01:31:41;"I think the song's doing alright"
01:31:41;01:31:43;"I heard it in the gym dude"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"What's at its height?"
01:31:45;01:31:47;"I was kickboxing with my brother"
01:31:47;01:31:49;"What?"
01:31:49;01:31:51;"You're kickboxing now?"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"Yeah we go to kickboxing classes on Saturday morning"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"Okay I like that"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"It's like 20-25 people, very co-ed class"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"There's a teacher with a wireless headset mic"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"That's just like ""Okay guys, body shots!"""
01:32:01;01:32:03;"And we're punching this"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"We lace up, put on gloves"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"And we're punching bags"
01:32:07;01:32:09;"And then we're doing roundhouse kicks"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"Down, give me 10 pushups"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"You can do a roundhouse kick?"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"Poorly, yes"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"Are you kicking Dave in the face?"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"No no no, a bag, a hanging"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"Oh everybody has a bag?"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"It's like 2 people per bag"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"Oh and you wait in line?"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"I actually spar, that doesn't uninterest me"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"So you're training just for"
01:32:29;01:32:31;"You know, just like getting in shape, conditioning"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"Okay, alright"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"It's brutal, it's an hour, it's insane"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"And they're just blasting"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"It's a lot of cardio"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"Pop radio or something?"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"This trainer dude was like ""I made a killer playlist"""
01:32:43;01:32:45;"Oh really?"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"And it had"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"""It's the sign of the times"" on there"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"""Just stop your crying, it's the sign of the times"""
01:32:51;01:32:53;"""It's the sign of the times"""
01:32:53;01:32:55;"And it also had ""9 inch nails hurt"""
01:32:55;01:32:57;"Which, thematically"
01:32:57;01:32:59;"Strong choice"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"Because you're doing like 25 pushups"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"And you're just like"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"""I hurt myself today"""
01:33:05;01:33:09;"15"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"16"
01:33:11;01:33:13;"When you're really"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"Working out, it's like the music is"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"Meaningless"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"Well that's why I'm making my"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"Post-punk and alternative workout playlist"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"I can't wait to hear that"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"So it came on and you were like ""this is tight"""
01:33:25;01:33:27;"Yeah, I was feeling it"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"So you were like ""honestly I'm glad to hear something with a"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"Tasteful 70's palette from one of the young guns"""
01:33:31;01:33:33;"I think anything at that volume"
01:33:33;01:33:35;"Sounds good"
01:33:35;01:33:37;"That's my theory"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"You're gonna like this man"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"So Niall Horan"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"So former bandmate of Harry"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"Yeah"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"Wendy's got a deep bench"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"He said Wendy's has a deep bench"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"1D"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"1D founded by Dave Thomas"
01:33:53;01:33:55;"19th century"
01:33:55;01:33:57;"Niall Horan"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"We actually listened to one of his songs once"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"It was kind of like a folky ballad called"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"""This Old Town"" or something"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"Not ringing a bell"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"Okay, well he came out of the gate with"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"Not quite a 70's palette, but you know a tasteful"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"Modern folk rock"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"Pop thing"
01:34:13;01:34:15;"Acoustic guitars"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"So anyway, before we hear the song"
01:34:17;01:34:19;"Listen to this"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"According to Horan, after listening to some of the material he had"
01:34:21;01:34:23;"He wanted to add a bit more grit"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"Funk and heavier bass"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"At the time he was listening to late 70's"
01:34:27;01:34:29;"And early 80's music"
01:34:29;01:34:31;"Like Don Henley"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"When he went solo in the early 80's"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"Nothing says funk and gritty bass"
01:34:35;01:34:37;"More than Don Henley"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"Don Henley"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"When he went solo in the early 80's"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"He just kind of had this funky kind of feel to it"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"Heavy bass, heavy guitar"
01:34:45;01:34:47;"Let's give this a crack"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Dirty laundry"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"Down at the sunset grill"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"Is now implying that early"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"Eagles did not have like"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"Funky bass and guitar"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"He's gotta listen to one of these nights"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"Right"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"Anyway, so Jake, I mean this literally must be"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"Your wet dream, man"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"I wouldn't go that far"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"Middle aged dude"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"Who's just been"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"At sea"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"For the past 10 years"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"Wondering when is that tasteful palette you love"
01:35:17;01:35:19;"Gonna come back"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"And then just looking around"
01:35:21;01:35:23;"As society changes"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"Looking for a tasteful palette"
01:35:25;01:35:29;"And it comes from one of the most likely places"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"Two members"
01:35:31;01:35:33;"Of a British boy band"
01:35:33;01:35:35;"And not just any boy band"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"One that started on a reality show"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"And he's getting into Don Henley"
01:35:39;01:35:41;"Things are cooking"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"The movie poster is"
01:35:43;01:35:45;"You, Harry Styles, and Awhorn"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"And like the tagline is like"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"Sometimes help comes when you least expect it"
01:35:49;01:35:53;"They're helping me"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"Yeah"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"You run a hardware store on Nantucket"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"These fantasies"
01:35:59;01:36:03;"Recently widowed"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"Oh my god"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"You run a hardware store on Nantucket"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"You think you're never gonna love again"
01:36:09;01:36:11;"And your teenage daughter only listens to the Chainsmokers"
01:36:11;01:36:15;"And she wants to go to school"
01:36:15;01:36:19;"In Boston"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"And you want her to go to the University of Nantucket"
01:36:21;01:36:25;"And then one summer"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"All the former members of 1D run a house together"
01:36:27;01:36:31;"They're trying to do like an exile kind of thing"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"Yeah they're reuniting for their"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"Music from Big Pink"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"They're teaming up again to make their Nantucket album"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"They're like we're just gonna get hammered on whiskey"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"And like"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"Yeah"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"Just plug our guitars in like a"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"PV amp and record"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"You're down at the local bar"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"You're just like hey Rudy make it a double"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"And then you hear these young cats"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"Like laughing"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"And you're just saying to Rudy like I just don't get it"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"My daughter only listens to the Chainsmokers"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"She wants to leave Nantucket man"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"Where did I go wrong? Blah blah"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"And then you just hear these two voices over there"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"Like"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"No mate"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"T-Rex is better than Bowie"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"Nah mate"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"Bowie is better than T-Rex"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"And you just look over like"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"Who are these guys Rudy?"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"Some young boy band out of England"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"Are they really talking about T-Rex and Bowie?"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"Sounds like a joke"
01:37:25;01:37:29;"Loving this fantasy"
01:37:29;01:37:31;"You know what Rudy buy them around"
01:37:31;01:37:33;"Then they come over"
01:37:33;01:37:35;"Dude what's your deal?"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"I'm a widower out in the local hardware store"
01:37:37;01:37:41;"Couldn't help but overhear you guys"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"Talking about the tasteful palate of early 70's British rock"
01:37:43;01:37:47;"Yeah mate I love that"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"You mean to tell me you young cats aren't at all about the Chainsmokers?"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"Nah mate"
01:37:51;01:37:53;"Hate the Chainsmokers"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"In that case next round's on me"
01:37:55;01:37:57;"I don't know"
01:37:57;01:37:59;"Whatever"
01:37:59;01:38:01;"They get you a new girlfriend"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"Okay"
01:38:03;01:38:05;"So this is all building up to Nile Horan's new single"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"Yep yep"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"Influenced by that late 70's"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"Early 80's Don Henley funk"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"I can't wait for this"
01:38:13;01:38:23;"I'm hearing the Henley"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"Yeah it's not, he wasn't blowing smoke"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"No"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"I get my news"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"From the evening news"
01:38:31;01:38:33;"Wait what?"
01:38:33;01:38:35;"That's what she said"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"Fly to my face"
01:38:37;01:38:39;"That's that kind of vintage vocal sound"
01:38:39;01:38:41;"Cause I want you baby"
01:38:41;01:38:43;"You almost guessed the melody"
01:38:43;01:38:45;"Yeah I want you baby"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"I've been thinking 'bout it all day"
01:38:47;01:38:51;"Doing cool stuff everyday"
01:38:51;01:38:53;"And then took it"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"This is the part where he's just like"
01:38:55;01:38:57;"Rented a house by the beach"
01:38:57;01:38:59;"By the beach"
01:38:59;01:39:01;"Yeah I want you baby"
01:39:01;01:39:03;"Slow hands"
01:39:03;01:39:05;"Like sweat dripping down"
01:39:05;01:39:07;"I'm not dirty no I'm drinking no"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"Slow hands"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"That's kinda cool"
01:39:11;01:39:15;"This is like the part of the movie where stuff starts coming together"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"Well Nile if you're looking for some extra cash"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"I could use some help around the hardware store"
01:39:19;01:39:21;"I'd love that mate"
01:39:21;01:39:23;"And this is you guys like"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"Horsing around"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"He like dusts off your old record player"
01:39:27;01:39:29;"To set it up in the hardware store"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"Start putting on tasteful 70's rock"
01:39:31;01:39:33;"While you guys are working"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"I gotta train you on the forklift"
01:39:35;01:39:37;"I just wanna take my time"
01:39:37;01:39:39;"And then like"
01:39:39;01:39:41;"You are now a Massachusetts certified"
01:39:41;01:39:43;"Forklift operator"
01:39:43;01:39:45;"All night"
01:39:45;01:39:47;"Yeah"
01:39:47;01:39:49;"Cause I want you"
01:39:49;01:39:51;"Yeah I want you baby"
01:39:51;01:39:53;"Slow hands"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"Like sweat dripping down"
01:39:55;01:39:57;"I'm not dirty no I'm drinking no"
01:39:57;01:39:59;"Slow hands"
01:39:59;01:40:01;"That's kinda cool"
01:40:01;01:40:03;"Yeah I want you baby"
01:40:03;01:40:05;"Like sweat dripping down"
01:40:05;01:40:07;"I'm not dirty no I'm drinking no"
01:40:07;01:40:09;"Slow hands"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"That's kinda cool"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"Yeah I want you baby"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"Like sweat dripping down"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"I'm not dirty no I'm drinking no"
01:40:17;01:40:19;"Slow hands"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"That's kinda cool"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"Take me home"
01:40:25;01:40:27;"Fingertips putting on the show"
01:40:27;01:40:29;"Can't you tell that I want you baby"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"Yeah"
01:40:31;01:40:33;"Slow hands"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"Like sweat dripping down"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"I'm not dirty laundry no"
01:40:37;01:40:39;"Wait did he say dirty laundry?"
01:40:39;01:40:41;"Wait like sweat dripping down dirty laundry"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"That makes no sense"
01:40:43;01:40:45;"Laundry absorbs sweat"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"Wait okay"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"Maybe we're missing something here"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"I was gonna say is this like a love song? Cause Henley"
01:40:51;01:40:53;"All his solo work was like"
01:40:53;01:40:55;"Deeply kind of metaphorical"
01:40:55;01:40:57;"It was about aging"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"Yeah"
01:40:59;01:41:01;"Idealism dying"
01:41:01;01:41:03;"The dreams of the 60's not working out"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"These um"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"Okay wait did he say laundry?"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Sweat dripping down your dirty laundry"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"On first listen"
01:41:11;01:41:13;"I thought it was dirty laundry"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"And did you like the vibe?"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"That's a terrible song no"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"Oh really? Dirty laundry?"
01:41:19;01:41:21;"No no this song"
01:41:21;01:41:23;"It's pretty"
01:41:23;01:41:25;"Not hating it not pumping me up"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"Okay so the chorus of this song"
01:41:27;01:41:31;"Dirty laundry is an awful Don Henley song"
01:41:31;01:41:33;"Dirty laundry"
01:41:33;01:41:35;"So for anybody"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"Who's not familiar with Don Henley's solo work"
01:41:37;01:41:39;"Can we get into a little dirty laundry"
01:41:39;01:41:41;"Just for reference"
01:41:41;01:41:43;"He has a song called dirty laundry"
01:41:43;01:41:45;"That obviously"
01:41:45;01:41:47;"Niall was"
01:41:47;01:41:49;"Inspired by"
01:41:49;01:41:51;"That is amazing to be inspired by dirty laundry"
01:41:51;01:41:53;"I cannot imagine that"
01:41:53;01:41:55;"Of all the pieces of music that"
01:41:55;01:41:57;"Well that's like in the movie"
01:41:57;01:41:59;"You're just like"
01:41:59;01:42:01;"You're kidding me you're in a dirty laundry"
01:42:01;01:42:03;"Young kid like you a fan of solo Henley"
01:42:03;01:42:05;"Oh I love it mate"
01:42:05;01:42:09;"I'm absolutely mad for it mate"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"It sounds like"
01:42:15;01:42:17;"Positively vibey in comparison"
01:42:17;01:42:19;"Slow hands"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"Sweat dripping down our dirty laundry"
01:42:21;01:42:25;"All of a sudden this sick keyboard drops in"
01:42:25;01:42:31;"Okay this song is funkier"
01:42:31;01:42:37;"I'm surprised you hate this song"
01:42:37;01:42:39;"This is actually making me appreciate it a lot more"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"I mean the drumming is sick"
01:42:41;01:43:07;"Henley's scathing critique"
01:43:07;01:43:09;"Of the gossip news industry"
01:43:09;01:43:13;"Seemed crucial in '83"
01:43:13;01:43:17;"So Niall says"
01:43:17;01:43:19;"I want like a new Henley song about like"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"Facebook"
01:43:21;01:43:23;"Or like Fox News"
01:43:23;01:43:25;"That's kind of always been his vibe"
01:43:25;01:43:27;"I want like an updated version"
01:43:27;01:43:29;"Maybe they exist"
01:43:29;01:43:31;"I open up my laptop"
01:43:31;01:43:33;"What do I see"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"Open up my laptop"
01:43:35;01:43:37;"What do I see"
01:43:37;01:43:39;"Whole lot of Facebook"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"Pictures"
01:43:41;01:43:43;"Pop it off at me"
01:43:43;01:43:45;"My aunt out in Tosa"
01:43:45;01:43:47;"You know I really don't care"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"I just wanted to get more Dylan"
01:43:49;01:43:53;"It all comes back to fake Dylan"
01:43:53;01:43:57;"Doing the Henley impression"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"Makes you realize how influenced"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"By Dylan he was"
01:44:01;01:44:03;"You just like strip it down"
01:44:03;01:44:05;"He was just doing like a Dylan"
01:44:05;01:44:09;"Unlock my iPhone"
01:44:09;01:44:11;"What do I see"
01:44:11;01:44:13;"Whole bunch of apps staring back at me"
01:44:13;01:44:19;"So Niall just to put it in perspective"
01:44:19;01:44:21;"Okay let's get back to Niall"
01:44:21;01:44:23;"Well because the Henley song is called Dirty Laundry"
01:44:23;01:44:25;"Niall's song goes slow slow hands"
01:44:25;01:44:27;"Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry"
01:44:27;01:44:29;"That just doesn't add up to me"
01:44:29;01:44:31;"No chance that I'm leaving here without you on me"

01:50:37;01:50:39;"A payoff at all"
01:50:39;01:50:41;"But"

01:56:11;01:56:13;"Because his first single"
01:56:13;01:56:15;"You don't even remember it"
01:56:15;01:56:17;"But like it's very inoffensive"
01:56:17;01:56:19;"But it doesn't have as much flavor as this one"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"This gave us a lot more to talk about"
01:56:21;01:56:23;"So I appreciate that shout out to Nile"
01:56:23;01:56:25;"To everybody else who's out there"
