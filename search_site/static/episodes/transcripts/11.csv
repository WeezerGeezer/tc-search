00:00;00:03;"Peace One."
00:03;00:10;"Time Crisis 11. Thanksgiving's over, but that doesn't mean we can't talk friends and family."
00:10;00:16;"On this episode, we're back in New York with Despot, Dave Maklovich of Chromio,"
00:16;00:20;"and the Bodega Boys themselves, Jesus and Mero."
00:20;00:27;"Come join us as we relax on this holiday weekend and listen to beautiful music"
00:27;00:30;"from people like New Kids on the Block. This is..."
00:30;00:34;"Time Crisis with Ezra Kainey."
00:34;00:37;"Peace One."
06:03;06:07;"That was East 17 with ""Stay Another Day""."
06:07;06:12;"Beautiful song from the bad boys of the UK boy band scene of the 90s."
06:12;06:16;"Welcome to Time Crisis. Today in the studio we have Despot."
06:16;06:18;"How's it going Despot?"
06:18;06:19;"Alright."
06:19;06:22;"And for the first time, my dear friend Dave Maklovich. What's up Dave?"
06:22;06:24;"It's about time."
06:24;06:27;"I know, I know. We've had some falling outs about this."
06:27;06:28;"Serious falling outs."
06:28;06:31;"It's been a long time, but you're a jet setting man."
06:31;06:34;"It's not like you're just sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring."
06:34;06:39;"No, I am. I pretend to jet set so that I actually look busy when you don't call me."
06:39;06:42;"I mean, where were you? Mexico last week?"
06:42;06:44;"Yeah."
06:44;06:46;"You're always somewhere every weekend."
06:46;06:51;"No, I'm at home, but when you call me to tell me why you didn't invite me to the show,"
06:51;06:54;"I have to make an excuse and then I say I'm on tour with my band."
06:54;06:56;"Oh, then you book like a last minute DJ set."
06:56;06:59;"Yeah, exactly. Then I got my agent and then I shoot a quick email."
06:59;07:01;"Just pop down to Mexico City."
07:01;07:02;"Exactly."
07:02;07:04;"Well, thanks for finally coming on the show Dave."
07:04;07:10;"You're now officially part of the Time Crisis family and this will be the first of many appearances we hope."
07:10;07:12;"And we got that on paper, right?"
07:12;07:15;"We have that on paper now. It's going to happen."
07:15;07:16;"Yeah, cool."
07:16;07:20;"We don't have to get into the whole back story. I think everybody knows who Chromio is,"
07:20;07:22;"but we could talk a little bit about how you and I first met."
07:22;07:26;"Because we've known each other. You're one of my oldest friends in the music business."
07:26;07:27;"That's right."
07:27;07:29;"Because I met you when I was 18 years old, 13 years ago."
07:29;07:35;"Yep. 13, yeah, exactly. In the fall of 2002."
07:35;07:41;"I was walking out of the library at Columbia and I saw this dude who looked familiar to me."
07:41;07:45;"And then I remember I saw him open for The Streets at Bowery Ballroom."
07:45;07:46;"The week before."
07:46;07:48;"The week before, which was Chromio's first show in New York."
07:48;07:53;"Chromio's second show ever and our first show in New York."
07:53;07:57;"And you were at Columbia getting your PhD."
07:57;08:00;"Yeah, it was like my third week at Columbia."
08:00;08:04;"Yeah, I don't think a lot... well, I guess maybe people used to know this about you,"
08:04;08:08;"that you were... while you're getting a PhD you have to also teach."
08:08;08:09;"That's right."
08:09;08:12;"So you were literally teaching just like intro to French at Barnard?"
08:12;08:16;"Well, no. I was teaching at Columbia while I was getting my PhD there."
08:16;08:19;"So I was doing... the first couple of years you do intro to French,"
08:19;08:23;"but I mean you have to teach for like seven years or five years."
08:23;08:28;"So by the end I was teaching like survey classes and translation classes"
08:28;08:30;"and essay writing classes and all that."
08:30;08:31;"But all in French?"
08:31;08:32;"Yeah."
08:32;08:33;"And you conduct a class in French?"
08:33;08:34;"Mm-hmm."
08:34;08:36;"And what was your thesis on?"
08:36;08:42;"The pleasure of reading in 18th century French literary theory."
08:42;08:45;"Nice. We'll be getting a lot more into that later."
08:45;08:46;"Yes."
08:47;08:50;"'Cause the last relationships of the rot"
08:50;08:53;"Got hurt majorly, finds it tough to trust"
08:53;08:55;"Looked at the ashtray, then looked back up"
08:55;08:57;"Spinning it away on the tabletop"
08:57;09:00;"She looked much fitter than Saturday Joss"
09:00;09:02;"She worked in JDs with Dan"
09:02;09:04;"Back then I figured she was pretty damn rough"
09:04;09:07;"But she was only wearing her work stuff"
09:07;09:09;"And in these clothes she looked more than buff"
09:09;09:12;"She stirred her straw, sat up to her Joss"
09:12;09:14;"I told her I thought it was important"
09:14;09:16;"That you could get lusty in conversation"
09:16;09:19;"Chatting shit, sitting in, oblivion"
09:19;09:21;"That person who's your special one"
09:21;09:24;"She said she was the worst pool player under the sun"
09:24;09:26;"But blokes go easy so she always won"
09:26;09:30;"I saw this thing on ITV the other week"
09:30;09:35;"Said that if she played with her hair she's probably keen"
09:35;09:39;"She's playing with her hair well regularly"
09:39;09:43;"So I reckon I could well be in"
09:44;09:47;"She didn't look too bored with what I was saying"
09:47;09:49;"Her hair looked much better than the other day"
09:49;09:52;"She had her fingers round her hair playing"
09:52;09:54;"I saw on telly that's a good indication"
09:54;09:56;"She didn't have to buy the next drink though, nay"
09:56;09:59;"But I suppose that's just our girl's way"
09:59;10:01;"I'm trying to think what else I could say"
10:01;10:04;"Peeling the label off, spinning the ashtray"
10:04;10:06;"Yeah, actually, yeah, she did look pretty neat"
10:06;10:08;"Her perfume smelled expensive and sweet"
10:08;10:11;"But I felt like my hair looked a bit cheap"
10:11;10:13;"I wished I'd had it copped back last week"
10:13;10:16;"She kept giving me this look as she would speak"
10:16;10:18;"Was she only friendly or was she a keen?"
10:18;10:20;"Asked her if she wanted the same again to drink"
10:20;10:23;"She started to turn and get up out my seat"
10:23;10:27;"I saw this thing on ITV the other week"
10:27;10:32;"Said that if she played with her hair she's probably keen"
10:32;10:36;"She's playing with her hair well regularly"
10:36;10:40;"So I reckon I could well be in"
10:41;10:44;"She said that her close mates all were"
10:44;10:46;"Always the most important thing to her"
10:46;10:49;"I said I thought it was a bit more blurred"
10:49;10:51;"She asked what I meant by that as she stirred"
10:51;10:54;"I told her about the money and what had occurred"
10:54;10:56;"With it going missing from the living room side"
10:56;10:58;"With my best mates all there standing by"
10:58;11:01;"Right where I left it, under their eyes"
11:01;11:03;"So surely one of them might have spied"
11:03;11:05;"What happened to my money at that time"
11:05;11:08;"I felt like they were all smiling on the side"
11:08;11:10;"She was like fair play, she couldn't say why"
11:10;11:12;"She didn't know what all my mates were like"
11:12;11:15;"And I said she just might be right"
11:15;11:17;"Wish I had someone I could always rely"
11:17;11:20;"Someone to get lost chatting to all night"
11:20;11:24;"I saw this thing on ITV the other week"
11:24;11:29;"Said that if she played with her hair she's probably keen"
11:29;11:33;"She's playing with her hair well regularly"
11:33;11:37;"So I reckon I could well be in"
11:37;11:42;"Earlier we were talking about birthdays today"
11:42;11:45;"Before we, you know, we have to talk about Thanksgiving"
11:45;11:47;"But before that we're talking, you know, don't forget"
11:47;11:49;"Sometimes people who have birthdays around the time of a big holiday"
11:49;11:51;"Their birthdays get kind of slept on"
11:51;11:53;"Yeah, yeah, they're always miserable"
11:53;11:54;"Yeah, it's not fun"
11:54;11:58;"Christmas birthday, July 4th birthday must just be bizarre"
11:58;12:01;"I think there's one guy who was happy his birthday was on Christmas"
12:01;12:03;"What?"
12:03;12:04;"Yeah"
12:04;12:05;"Jesus"
12:05;12:06;"That's right"
12:06;12:07;"That's the one guy, he's the only guy"
12:07;12:08;"He's the only guy"
12:08;12:11;"We were talking about holiday birthdays"
12:11;12:13;"And this is the Sunday after Thanksgiving"
12:13;12:17;"So we gotta shout out some people in the music community"
12:17;12:20;"Who have a birthday now that probably, you know, this is a day everybody's traveling"
12:20;12:22;"And probably a lot of people are forgetting about it"
12:22;12:24;"But it's Jonathan Knight from New Kid on the Block"
12:24;12:26;"New Kid's on the Block's birthday"
12:26;12:28;"He was a new kid on the block"
12:28;12:30;"He was, and I guess he still is because they still tour"
12:30;12:31;"Whoa"
12:31;12:32;"They went out with Backstreet Boys"
12:32;12:34;"Didn't they have a cruise recently or something?"
12:34;12:36;"I heard it's so tight, that must be so good"
12:36;12:37;"I heard about that"
12:37;12:38;"How did we not go to that?"
12:38;12:39;"I don't know"
12:39;12:41;"Were you guys New Kid's fans?"
12:41;12:45;"I was not, but I had that album, whichever album that was"
12:45;12:46;"With the Hangin' Tough?"
12:46;12:47;"Yeah, Hangin' Tough"
12:47;12:49;"Wait, are we, we're about the same age roughly, right?"
12:49;12:50;"I think we talked about that last time"
12:50;12:53;"Like, we could never have been New Kid's fans"
12:53;12:54;"It was like, it was like"
12:54;12:57;"I mean, that was like, would have been an embarrassing thing to be"
12:57;13:01;"But see, that's what's weird, people forget that the New Kid's were actually tough"
13:01;13:02;"Hangin' Tough"
13:02;13:04;"Hangin' Tough was not just talk"
13:04;13:05;"No, they're"
13:05;13:06;"They actually hung tough"
13:06;13:07;"They really were, right"
13:07;13:11;"They were, they were, they were like, like street kids from Boston"
13:11;13:16;"And I was telling Despot, Joe, like the youngest kid"
13:16;13:17;"Yeah"
13:17;13:20;"He was like a really dope graffiti writer, he wrote Popeye"
13:20;13:21;"Whoa, that's actually"
13:21;13:22;"A real name"
13:22;13:24;"Popeye was his tag?"
13:24;13:25;"Yep"
13:25;13:26;"Damn"
13:26;13:29;"And he was up, like Arman Van Heldens from Boston"
13:29;13:30;"Oh, really?"
13:30;13:31;"Yeah, so he knew all those dudes"
13:31;13:33;"He was like writing with them back in the day?"
13:33;13:35;"Nah, but he knew them, like he was like, oh, those kids were real"
13:35;13:39;"And I mean, they were just gonna be like, they were gonna be like New Edition, you know"
13:39;13:41;"And there's like the famous Apollo"
13:41;13:45;"And that was the whole concept was that whoever kind of put it together was like, I want a white New Edition"
13:45;13:49;"Yeah, it's Maurice Starr, I believe the name is"
13:49;13:51;"The impresario and producer"
13:51;13:53;"Let's see how it sounds now"
13:53;13:54;"You gonna play it?"
13:54;13:55;"Maybe it's toughened up"
13:55;13:56;"Yeah, let's listen to"
13:56;13:58;"Here's Hangin' Tough by the white New Edition"
13:58;13:59;"Great"
13:59;14:19;"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa"
14:19;14:25;"Listen up everybody if you wanna take a chance"
14:25;14:30;"Just get on the floor to the new kid's dance"
14:30;14:35;"Don't worry 'bout nothing 'cause it won't take long"
14:35;14:39;"We're gonna put you in a trance with our funky song"
14:39;14:40;"'Cause you gotta be"
14:40;14:49;"Stangin' tough, stangin' tough, stangin' tough"
14:49;14:51;"Are you tough enough?"
14:51;15:00;"Stangin' tough, stangin' tough, stangin' tough"
15:00;15:01;"We're up!"
15:01;15:12;"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa"
15:12;15:17;"Everybody's always talking 'bout who's on top"
15:17;15:23;"Don't cross our path 'cause you're gonna get stuck"
15:23;15:28;"We ain't gonna give anybody any slack"
15:28;15:32;"And if you try to keep us down we're gonna come right back"
15:32;15:33;"And you know we're"
15:33;15:42;"Stangin' tough, stangin' tough, stangin' tough"
15:42;15:44;"Are you tough enough?"
15:44;15:53;"Stangin' tough, stangin' tough, stangin' tough"
15:53;15:54;"We're up!"
15:54;16:02;"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa"
16:02;16:04;"You're listening to..."
16:04;16:08;"Time Crisis on BEATS 1"
16:08;16:10;"That was new kids on the block with ""Hangin' Tough."""
16:10;16:12;"I think that sounded pretty tough."
16:12;16:17;"Yeah, I remember this kid I knew in elementary school."
16:17;16:21;"It was one of those things that kids in school would sing"
16:21;16:24;"that was like a parody of a popular song at the time."
16:24;16:26;"And I remember instead of whatever,"
16:26;16:28;"like everybody's always talking about who's on top,"
16:28;16:32;"it was, ""If you wanna be stupid and you wanna wet your pants,"
16:32;16:35;"just get on the floor and do the new kids dance."""
16:35;16:38;"And then it was new kids suck instead of hangin' tough."
16:38;16:39;"It never ends."
16:39;16:40;"Yeah, man."
16:40;16:41;"So there were a lot of brothers,"
16:41;16:43;"brothers meaning two boys with the same parents,"
16:43;16:45;"in new kids on the block."
16:45;16:48;"But that got me thinking because it's Thanksgiving weekend,"
16:48;16:50;"so it's all about family"
16:50;16:53;"because that's a group that has Donnie Wahlberg,"
16:53;16:54;"who's brother's Mark Wahlberg,"
16:54;16:56;"then you got the Knight brothers."
16:56;16:59;"I don't know, Joey's probably their cousin or something."
16:59;17:00;"It's a real family group."
17:00;17:04;"So I thought maybe we'd talk a little bit about family"
17:04;17:05;"on today's Time Crisis."
17:05;17:07;"Maybe that'll be kind of the theme."
17:07;17:08;"Okay."
17:08;17:10;"All right, great."
17:10;17:12;"One thing I've always been curious about"
17:12;17:14;"is because I'm an older brother, I have a younger sister,"
17:14;17:16;"Emma, who's been on the show before."
17:16;17:17;"Huh, interesting."
17:17;17:20;"Yeah, Dave met her for the first time in L.A. last week."
17:20;17:23;"After how many years? 12 years?"
17:23;17:24;"I guess."
17:24;17:26;"Well, but here's the thing."
17:26;17:28;"Dave, your younger brother, A-Track,"
17:28;17:30;"is a world-famous DJ."
17:30;17:33;"You know, he's gonna be at Coachella."
17:33;17:35;"He's gonna be at Lollapalooza."
17:35;17:37;"But my sister doesn't do those things."
17:37;17:38;"She's never been to a festival."
17:38;17:41;"Yeah, but you met A-Track how many years into a friendship?"
17:41;17:42;"Two? Three?"
17:42;17:43;"Hard to say."
17:43;17:46;"But anyway, so I'm curious about this."
17:46;17:48;"What's it like having a brother?"
17:48;17:50;"'Cause you guys are both-- wait, are you an older brother?"
17:50;17:51;"I'm a younger brother."
17:51;17:52;"Oh."
17:52;17:54;"Yeah."
17:54;17:58;"What was going on in the Maklovich household?"
17:58;18:03;"Growing up, we're Montreal, Canada."
18:03;18:06;"We spoke French."
18:06;18:09;"So at home, like 1989,"
18:09;18:11;"New Kids on the Block are out."
18:11;18:13;"Yeah, one year before my bar mitzvah."
18:13;18:15;"Okay, so you're 12 years old."
18:15;18:17;"How old's A-Track?"
18:17;18:20;"He is gonna be 8."
18:20;18:22;"So the two of you guys are at home in Montreal, Canada,"
18:22;18:23;"just speaking French."
18:23;18:25;"Yeah, I'm 11."
18:25;18:28;"11, 12, we're at home speaking French."
18:28;18:31;"I'm rocking Ocean Pacific head to toe."
18:31;18:35;"You know, I've got a Vornay t-shirt"
18:35;18:38;"that my mom got on special somewhere."
18:38;18:42;"And I've got--"
18:42;18:45;"Actually, that year, so I couldn't--"
18:45;18:48;"my parents couldn't afford Nike Airs for us."
18:48;18:50;"Like, all my friends had them, like the Agassiz,"
18:50;18:52;"'cause like '89 probably, right?"
18:52;18:54;"So I remember wanting the Agassiz so bad,"
18:54;18:56;"""It's not gonna happen."""
18:56;19:01;"We had a cutoff of like $60 for sneakers."
19:01;19:03;"Couldn't get Nike Airs with that."
19:03;19:06;"Even in 1989, you couldn't buy Nike Airs for $60?"
19:06;19:07;"$60 is fair."
19:07;19:08;"Nah, dude."
19:08;19:10;"It was $80, it was $80."
19:10;19:12;"Jordans were over $100 already by then."
19:12;19:13;"They were like $100."
19:13;19:15;"Canadian dollars too, by the way."
19:15;19:16;"Pumps, forget about it."
19:16;19:17;"Pumps were mad expensive."
19:17;19:18;"Pumps were more expensive."
19:18;19:22;"And so--but Brooks, do you remember Brooks?"
19:22;19:24;"Yeah, the tennis shoe company."
19:24;19:27;"So they had for a very short time their own--"
19:27;19:30;"they were gonna have their own technological sneaker."
19:30;19:32;"And they were called the Brooks Hydro Flows."
19:32;19:36;"And my mom--I swear to God, Brooks Hydro Flows."
19:36;19:38;"I bet you we could find them."
19:38;19:41;"And my mom could afford those, so I was wearing"
19:41;19:45;"Brooks Hydro Flows and Ocean Pacific head to toe, basically."
19:45;19:46;"And that was the deal."
19:46;19:47;"That was me."
19:47;19:49;"Excuse me, aren't you Lavergne?"
19:49;19:51;"What are y'all doing here?"
21:30;21:32;"So was there hip-hop in the household?"
21:32;21:34;"No, this is--"
21:34;21:36;"""In the house"" is the proper way to say that."
21:36;21:37;"Was there hip-hop?"
21:37;21:39;"It wasn't even in the--yeah, it was--"
21:39;21:41;"no, there was no hip-hop in the house yet."
21:41;21:45;"Maybe I was already listening to like Hendrix and stuff like that."
21:45;21:47;"Or maybe, you know, stuff like probably that."
21:47;21:48;"Probably Hendrix and Led Zeppelin."
21:48;21:49;"Because yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
21:49;21:50;"This was that."
21:50;21:52;"It was like already--and I was collecting records already,"
21:52;21:55;"but I hadn't made the switch to hip-hop yet."
21:55;21:58;"Just listening to '70s music or rock or whatever."
21:58;22:00;"And then a couple years after that,"
22:00;22:04;"like basically that music basically led me to Cypress Hill"
22:04;22:06;"and like Beastie Boys, ""Check Your Head."""
22:06;22:11;"And then those were the gateways to like hip-hop, I guess."
22:11;22:14;"I mean, I'm sure you could relate to that."
22:14;22:17;"It's like you've got your gateway hip-hop groups."
22:17;22:20;"Very often it's like the Beasties or Cypress Hill or whatever."
22:20;22:23;"And then you get the one thing that you can kind of start doing."
22:23;22:25;"So my first thing was like, ""Oh, I'm going to write graffiti."""
22:25;22:29;"And then I had a band, and that was--"
22:29;22:32;"by mid-'90s, all the bands had like a DJ in them."
22:32;22:35;"It was like Acid Jazz, which is, by the way,"
22:35;22:37;"one of the dopest things to rediscover"
22:37;22:39;"if you're like, ""We should do an Acid Jazz playlist."""
22:39;22:41;"And like brand new heavies and stuff like that."
22:41;22:43;"They all had like a DJ scratching and stuff."
22:43;22:45;"And we had a DJ."
22:45;22:49;"By then I'm like 15 or whatever, so that's like 4 years later."
22:49;22:51;"I'm 15. I'm already kind of into hip-hop,"
22:51;22:54;"and we still have a band, and there's like MCs in there and everything."
22:54;22:57;"And we had a DJ, and he was terrible."
22:57;23:01;"And we were watching ""Wild Style"" all the time and stuff,"
23:01;23:03;"and I was like, ""Yo, it can't be that hard."
23:03;23:05;"Like really, this guy just sucks."""
23:05;23:08;"So I told my brother, ""Why don't you try it?"
23:08;23:11;"You're at home watching The Simpsons just doing nothing."""
23:11;23:13;"- And what, he was like 11? - He was 11, yeah."
23:13;23:15;"- He's basically like a little kid. - A child."
23:15;23:17;"And I was like, ""You're doing nothing."
23:17;23:19;"You're just like here watching us."""
23:19;23:21;"Basically when you're 11 and you've got an older brother,"
23:21;23:23;"you're like a stan."
23:23;23:26;"You're just like watching them, like in awe of everything you do."
23:26;23:28;"Like I'm writing graffiti, he's writing--"
23:28;23:31;"It's like the Borat thing, like I have a radio with a clock, he has a radio."
23:31;23:34;"Like he just does--trolls everything you do."
23:34;23:36;"So I was like, ""Look, stop just doing everything"
23:36;23:39;"and just following me silently everywhere,"
23:39;23:42;"and try your own thing, like try scratching."""
23:42;23:46;"And basically my brother took the turntable that was at the house"
23:46;23:49;"and started scratching on it"
23:49;23:52;"on this one record that had an acapella."
23:52;23:57;"It was the Beastie Boys' 45 for ""Fruit Loop,"""
23:57;24:00;"and it had an acapella section on it, and he started scratching."
24:00;24:02;"And he was already better than the guy that was scratching"
24:02;24:05;"in our high school acid jazz band."
24:05;24:08;"- Imagine that. - Imagine."
24:08;24:10;"So I was like, ""Dude, you should really do this."""
24:10;24:13;"And my brother was like, ""Okay, I got nothing going on."""
24:13;24:17;"And that's how it started. It was like that."

28:21;28:24;"is that I think for a lot of people today"
28:24;28:27;"Canada, because of Drake and Weeknd and other people"
28:27;28:29;"in terms of like cool hip-hop and R&B"
28:29;28:30;"it's like a major player."
28:30;28:32;"It was not like that."
28:32;28:34;"It's honestly hard to imagine that there was a time"
28:34;28:36;"like when you were living in Montreal"
28:36;28:38;"like it was almost like a backwater."
28:38;28:39;"Yes."
28:39;28:42;"Like there wasn't even like a hip-hop record store."
28:42;28:44;"No, there were like two, no there were."
28:44;28:48;"No, it was probably like, I don't know,"
28:48;28:50;"like a small US town where you have"
28:50;28:52;"like your one mom and pop store and like--"
28:52;28:54;"It's not that you didn't have access to hip-hop"
28:54;28:57;"or like cool sneakers, but there was no sense"
28:57;29:00;"of Canadian hip-hop."
29:00;29:03;"There's no sense of Canadian hip-hop identity."
29:03;29:06;"Well, they were trying to do it"
29:06;29:09;"and it was all like Toronto guys."
29:09;29:11;"What year are we talking now?"
29:11;29:13;"Well, now we're like fast forwarding."
29:13;29:15;"No, we're like early 90s."
29:15;29:18;"Early 90s was still like fluke Canadian hip-hop artists."
29:18;29:19;"Like remember Maestro, right?"
29:19;29:20;"Yeah."
29:20;29:21;"Yeah, so like Maestro, Fresh West,"
29:21;29:23;"this guy who came out of nowhere"
29:23;29:26;"and then got sort of put on by Showbiz and AG,"
29:26;29:29;"like the Showbiz who's like a really famous"
29:29;29:32;"New York hip-hop producer, Seminole."
29:32;29:34;"So he had Cred."
29:34;29:36;"Or was that, or Snow, I think,"
29:36;29:38;"I feel like Snow was down with those guys."
29:38;29:39;"Oh, like Informer?"
29:39;29:40;"Yeah, Snow's Canadian."
29:40;29:41;"That's a great song."
29:41;29:42;"Snow's definitely Canadian."
29:42;29:43;"Okay, yeah, Snow was--"
29:43;29:45;"Maybe it was Snow that was down with Showbiz."
29:45;29:46;"Wait, who was it?"
29:46;29:48;"Nah, nah, Snow had--"
29:48;29:50;"Who was rapping on Informer?"
29:50;29:51;"No."
29:51;29:53;"Nah, but wasn't there like a guy,"
29:53;29:55;"like I feel like he had like"
29:55;29:58;"some legendary rap guy on there."
29:58;30:00;"Informer's still, I mean,"
30:00;30:02;"you can't do karaoke without doing that one, right?"
30:02;30:04;"Yeah, I know all the words to Informer."
30:04;30:05;"Tight."
30:05;30:07;"Which is, by the way, which is a song about a snitch."
30:07;30:08;"Yeah."
30:08;30:09;"Yeah, people don't know that."
30:09;30:11;"It's a very, it's a song about snitches."
30:11;30:13;"Well, you know, the tough thing is that,"
30:13;30:15;"'cause nobody knows what he says after Informer,"
30:15;30:16;"so what's he talking about?"
30:16;30:17;"Like, what's he gonna do to the--"
30:17;30:18;"♪ Informer, been a-- ♪"
30:18;30:20;"Like, after that, it sounds like--"
30:20;30:21;"MC Shan, that's who it was."
30:21;30:22;"Oh, that's right, that's right."
30:22;30:23;"It was Shan."
30:23;30:24;"That's right, that's right."
30:24;30:26;"So, Maestro was down with Showbiz, I think,"
30:26;30:27;"and Snow was down with Shan."
30:27;30:28;"You're absolutely right."
30:28;30:30;"And Shan produced Informer."
30:30;30:30;"That's right."
30:30;30:31;"That's crazy."
30:31;30:34;"All right, let's listen to Informer by Snow"
30:34;30:37;"from the seminal album 12 Inches of Snow."
30:37;30:39;"Which is so smart."
30:39;30:41;"The 12 inch, you know what I mean?"

47:25;47:27;"'Cause that's considered some like Anglo sh*t?"
47:27;47:29;"Yeah. So I never knew."
47:29;47:32;"I never understood the Canadian one and much less the American one."
47:32;47:34;"I don't understand the American one."
47:34;47:36;"Wait, so... Well said."
47:36;47:40;"Obviously we're very thrilled to have you at our Thanksgiving."
47:40;47:43;"What's like your typical Thanksgiving's been like in years past?"
47:43;47:44;"Mine? Yeah."
47:44;47:47;"We would... There's a bigger table that we have."
47:47;47:51;"We'd take the big table out and unfold the big table."
47:51;47:52;"Mom and dad."
47:52;47:58;"Mom and dad would unfold the big table and then make a turkey."
47:58;48:02;"And my mom makes these like sweet carrots that are pretty good."
48:02;48:06;"And you know, make all your traditional Thanksgiving dishes."
48:06;48:10;"And then we would invite all the people who I used to call uncle growing up."
48:10;48:12;"But none of them were my uncle."
48:12;48:14;"What were they? Cousin brothers?"
48:14;48:15;"I guess like my dad's friends."
48:15;48:16;"Oh, just friends."
48:16;48:21;"Yeah. And now they're pretty much... Most of them are not around anymore."
48:21;48:23;"So we don't do anything."
48:23;48:24;"Just take it real easy."
48:24;48:27;"Yeah. Still cook a turkey once in a while."
48:27;48:29;"I think last year there was a turkey."
48:29;48:31;"And you guys are Jewish, right?"
48:31;48:33;"Yeah, we're Jewish. Through and through."
48:33;48:36;"I was asking your parents last year, basically in America,"
48:36;48:38;"Jews do Thanksgiving just like everyone else."
48:38;48:43;"Oh yeah, yeah. No, Jews love Thanksgiving because it's like Christmas for Jewish people."
48:43;48:45;"And then on Christmas they're having Chinese food anyway."
48:45;48:47;"Yeah, on Christmas you have to have Chinese food."
48:47;48:48;"You have to."
48:48;48:49;"What?"
48:49;48:51;"Should we?"
48:51;48:54;"I was thinking maybe I'll keep it on the family tip"
48:54;48:58;"because Thanksgiving is about relationships and family and friends and things like that."
48:58;48:59;"I'm going to play Family Affair."
48:59;49:01;"Here's Family Affair."
49:01;49:05;"It's a family affair."
49:05;49:09;"It's a family affair."
49:09;49:14;"It's a family affair."
49:19;49:23;"One child grows up to be"
49:23;49:28;"somebody that just loves to learn how to howl."
49:28;49:32;"Another child grows up to be"
49:32;49:36;"somebody who just loves to burn."
49:36;49:41;"Mom loves the both of them."
49:41;49:45;"You see it's in the blood."
49:45;49:49;"Both kids are good and bound."
49:49;49:51;"Blood's thicker than the mud."
49:51;49:53;"It's a family affair."
49:53;49:56;"It's a family affair."
49:56;49:59;"It's a family affair."
49:59;50:01;"All of it."
50:24;50:29;"Newly wed a year ago."
50:29;50:33;"But we're still checking each other out."
50:33;50:38;"Nobody wants to blow."
50:38;50:43;"Nobody wants to be left out."
50:43;50:46;"You can't leave because your heart is there."
50:46;50:51;"But you can't stay because you've been somewhere else."
50:51;50:55;"You can't cry 'cause you look broke down."
50:55;50:58;"But you cried anyway 'cause you're all broke down."
50:58;51:00;"It's a family affair."
51:04;51:07;"It's a family affair."
51:07;51:09;"Yeah, family affair."
51:09;51:12;"Family affair."
51:12;51:15;"It's a family affair."
51:23;51:27;"It's a family affair."
51:27;51:32;"It's a family affair."
51:32;51:35;"It's a family affair."
51:38;51:39;"Yeah."
51:56;52:06;"Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man."
52:06;52:15;"So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand."
52:15;52:25;"Like T-O-Y or maybe S-U-R-P-R-I-S-E."
52:25;52:34;"But the words we're hiding from him now tear the heart right out of me."
52:34;52:44;"Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E becomes I know today."
52:44;52:54;"Me and little J-O-E will be going away."
52:54;53:03;"I love you both and this will be pure H-E-L-L for me."
53:03;53:16;"Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E."
53:16;53:18;"Watch him smile."
53:18;53:25;"He thinks it's Christmas or his fifth birthday."
53:25;53:35;"And he thinks C-U-S-T-O-D-Y spells fun or play."
53:35;53:44;"I spell out all the hurt words and turn my head when I speak."
53:44;53:54;"'Cause I can't spell away this hurt that's dripping down my cheek."
53:54;54:04;"Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E becomes I know today."
54:04;54:13;"Me and little J-O-E will be going away."
54:13;54:22;"I love you both and this will be pure H-E-L-L for me."
54:22;54:34;"Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E."
54:35;54:39;"That was Tammy Wynette with D-I-V-O-R-C-E, aka Divorce."
54:39;54:41;"I thought we'd show, you know, play Family Affair."
54:41;54:44;"This is the other side of family drama."
54:44;54:45;"But we're talking about family."
54:45;54:46;"And you know what?"
54:46;54:49;"Just because people get divorced, it doesn't mean they can't break bread together at Thanksgiving."
54:49;54:51;"Oh, is that what happens?"
54:51;54:53;"Well, and I was just thinking about, like, family stuff."
54:53;54:56;"This is a, you know, some people can't."
54:56;54:59;"You mean, like, the divorced parents will get back together for dinner?"
54:59;55:00;"Is that what you're saying?"
55:00;55:01;"I mean, sometimes."
55:01;55:03;"Sometimes people can't get back together for dinner."
55:03;55:11;"Sometimes people get so cool that it'll be mom, stepdad, dad, stepmom, all breaking bread together."
55:11;55:12;"That's an R. Kelly song."
55:12;55:15;"That is an R. Kelly song right there."
55:15;55:16;"I'm not down for that."
55:16;55:17;"No."
55:17;55:21;"If I was the stepdad or the original dad, I wouldn't."
55:21;55:22;"Nope."
55:23;55:28;"You could come to me and your stepmom's house the day after or the day before."
55:28;55:29;"Get leftovers."
55:29;55:31;"You wouldn't break bread with your ex-wife and her new husband?"
55:31;55:33;"No, man, that'd be a fight."
55:33;55:35;"And her new jacked bodybuilder husband?"
55:35;55:36;"Goy."
55:36;55:37;"I would be."
55:37;55:39;"Her new Goy jacked husband."
55:39;55:40;"I have no problem."
55:40;55:46;"See, when I was younger, I used to always imagine if I ever, like, had children and got divorced,"
55:46;55:50;"probably the worst part would be the stepdad situation."
55:50;55:51;"Yeah."
55:51;55:54;"Would be to have your children being raised by, like, a bodybuilder."
55:54;55:57;"But then the more I thought about it, I was like, oh, you know, that's just, like, selfish."
55:57;55:59;"Like, you should probably give him a chance."
55:59;56:01;"Like, he's probably cool."
56:01;56:04;"He probably also, you know, would be, like, a pretty regimented lifestyle."
56:04;56:08;"He's used to, like, eating right and, you know, waking up at this time and working out."
56:08;56:10;"He'd keep your kids in line."
56:10;56:13;"Yeah, and then they like him more than they like you."
56:13;56:14;"Well, no, it's different."
56:14;56:15;"You're like a deadbeat schmuck."
56:15;56:17;"Yeah, and you can't even beat him up."
56:17;56:18;"You can't beat him up."
56:18;56:20;"You can't beat him up, because then he's like, don't touch my kids."
56:20;56:22;"And you're like, they're my kids."
56:22;56:23;"Yeah, but--"
56:23;56:24;"Then he just, like, slaps you."
56:24;56:25;"Yeah."
56:25;56:26;"You fall and you cry."
56:26;56:27;"No, but you want to be cool with that guy."
56:27;56:30;"And also, first of all, because at his household, there's the constant--"
56:30;56:35;"He's always making the kids work out, and he's always making them eat the high-protein diet."
56:35;56:39;"Then when they come over to your house every other weekend, you know, then you can break out--"
56:39;56:40;"That's true."
56:40;56:41;"They love me."
56:41;56:42;"--the carbohydrates."
56:42;56:43;"Yeah, here's some donuts, kids."
56:43;56:44;"I'm carb daddy."
56:44;56:45;"Carb daddy."
56:45;56:46;"That's right."
56:46;56:47;"Carb daddy."
56:47;56:50;"I like to think of myself as a bodybuilder, though, so I can't really imagine myself--"
56:50;56:51;"That's true."
56:51;56:52;"You're getting pretty jacked right now."
56:52;56:53;"I'm very strong."
56:53;56:54;"OK, wait, can we talk about something for a second?"
56:54;56:55;"I don't know."
56:55;56:58;"We should talk about somebody who's been on this show before a lot."
56:58;57:00;"We should have him on again soon."
57:00;57:03;"But everybody's talking about how our good friend Makonnen--"
57:03;57:04;"Oh, yeah, he's--"
57:04;57:05;"--is, like, ripped now."
57:05;57:06;"He's looking good."
57:06;57:07;"He's amazing."
57:07;57:08;"Yeah, he's doing his thing."
57:08;57:09;"It's funny--"
57:09;57:10;"How much weight did he lose?"
57:10;57:11;"I don't know, but a lot."
57:11;57:14;"We talked about it in the beginning when I started doing my, like, serious workout thing."
57:14;57:15;"Yeah."
57:15;57:17;"He was like, ""Oh, you too?"" And I was like, ""What do you mean, man?"""
57:17;57:20;"And he was like, ""Yeah, I'm working out all the time, too."""
57:20;57:27;"And at that time, I guess, you know, he was in the early stages, and I was looking at him, and I was like, ""You're not working out all the time."""
57:27;57:28;"Yeah."
57:28;57:28;"And, you know, whatever."
57:28;57:29;"But there's a tipping point."
57:29;57:31;"I mean, within maybe two weeks."
57:31;57:34;"But, you know, if you work out hard enough, you can eat whatever you want."
57:34;57:35;"I eat whatever I want."
57:35;57:36;"Huh."
57:36;57:37;"You should see these abs."
57:37;57:38;"You can."
57:38;57:39;"On Instagram."
57:39;57:40;"Check it."
57:40;57:45;"If you want to see some washboard abs, go to @despotroast on Instagram."
57:45;57:50;"You know, I should maybe post a new one, though, because that's old, and, you know, my results, as they say--"
57:50;57:51;"You should do a big--"
57:51;57:52;"--a lot better."
57:52;57:55;"Oh, you know, you also got to do a side-by-side to show people how far you've come."
57:55;57:56;"Yeah."
57:57;58:03;"I was going to do that, but my phone that had my before pictures on it broke, and I didn't have it backed up."
58:03;58:05;"And I don't trust the cloud."
58:05;58:06;"All right, well--"
58:06;58:07;"No offense."
58:07;58:08;"Never trust the cloud."
58:08;58:09;"That's no fun for the fans."
58:09;58:22;"Well, anyway, we haven't played any Makonnen on this show in a while, so we want to say shout-out to Makonnen, because whatever type of body you want, whether you want to
be overweight, underweight, as long as it's in a relatively healthy range--"
58:22;58:23;"Right."
58:23;58:24;"Do that."
58:25;58:29;"And as long as you're achieving that, then we're thrilled for you, and you look great as long as you feel happy."
58:29;58:31;"And Makonnen seems happy, so--"
58:31;58:33;"You're a beautiful man, Makonnen."
58:33;58:34;"You should play--"
58:34;58:35;"Very good-looking man."
58:35;58:38;"--Second Chance, that new one he did with Mustard, just came out."
58:38;58:41;"Here's ""I Love Makonnen"" with Second Chance."
58:41;58:45;"[music - ""i love you girl""]"
58:46;58:50;"(SINGING) I like you, girl, and I still do."
58:50;58:56;"I wish I had a second chance at loving you."
58:56;59:01;"Because I like you, girl, and I still do."
59:01;59:07;"I wish I had a second chance at loving you."
59:07;59:15;"I remember when you would leave your friends to spend time with me."
59:15;59:17;"And cheat on him."
59:17;59:22;"I would never lie what tears from your eyes."
59:22;59:28;"Now I wonder why, and I bet you don't lie."
59:28;59:32;"Because I like you, girl, and I still do."
59:32;59:38;"I wish I had a second chance at loving you."
59:38;59:43;"Because I like you, girl, and I still do."
59:43;59:48;"I wish I had a second chance at loving you."
59:48;59:54;"Because you remember when I would leave my friends"
59:54;59:56;"to spend some time."
59:56;59:59;"And hear what's on your mind."
59:59;01:00:04;"I would sneak from your mom, hold kisses on your arm."
01:00:04;01:00:09;"You would hold my hand, say I was your only man."
01:00:09;01:00:14;"And I liked you, girl, and I still do."
01:00:14;01:00:20;"I wish I had a second chance at loving you."
01:00:20;01:00:25;"Because I like you, girl, and I still do."
01:00:25;01:00:30;"I wish I had a second chance at loving you."
01:00:30;01:00:35;"Because I'll be wishing when I would see you again."
01:00:35;01:00:41;"So we could be what we used to be back then."
01:00:41;01:00:46;"Because I like you, girl, and I still do."
01:00:46;01:00:51;"I wish I had a second chance at loving you."
01:00:51;01:00:56;"Because I like you, girl, and I still do."
01:00:56;01:01:01;"I wish I had a second chance at loving you."
01:01:01;01:01:04;"Wish I had a second chance."
01:01:04;01:01:07;"I wish I had a second chance."
01:01:07;01:01:12;"I wish I had a second chance at loving you."
01:01:12;01:01:17;"Because I like you, girl, and I still do."
01:01:17;01:01:23;"I wish I had a second chance at loving you."
01:01:23;01:01:25;"That was I Love Makonnen with ""Second Chance."""
01:01:25;01:01:27;"All this talk about Makonnen really--"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"I've been talking all this game my whole life"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"about getting jacked."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"I've never even come close."
01:01:31;01:01:35;"I could give you my Beachbody.com password if you want."
01:01:35;01:01:36;"Really?"
01:01:36;01:01:37;"I'd appreciate that."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"Actually, I'm very inspired by Makonnen."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"And again, it's not that I don't hate my body."
01:01:40;01:01:43;"I just want to know what it's like to be jacked."
01:01:43;01:01:44;"It's amazing."
01:01:44;01:01:45;"Is it?"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"How has your life changed since you've been jacked?"
01:01:47;01:01:48;"I'm just a lot stronger."
01:01:48;01:01:50;"You know, you just walk around feeling strong."
01:01:50;01:01:52;"It's a great feeling."
01:01:52;01:01:53;"My posture is better."
01:01:53;01:01:54;"Yeah."
01:01:54;01:01:56;"I feel like I could punch anyone's head off."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"I think that's the best part."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"That's a great thing."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"That's the best part."
01:01:59;01:02:00;"Wait, David, have you ever been jacked?"
01:02:00;01:02:01;"Never been jacked."
01:02:02;01:02:03;"I'm also not jacked."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"You're kind of jacked."
01:02:04;01:02:05;"I mean--"
01:02:05;01:02:06;"I look good with my shirt off."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"That's all I want."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"I'll give myself that."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"See, because Makonnen has been performing with his shirt off."
01:02:10;01:02:11;"That's why everybody's talking about it."
01:02:11;01:02:12;"Yeah, yeah."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"The shirt's been off."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"The kid can't keep his shirt on."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"He's so happy."
01:02:15;01:02:16;"Yeah, but you know what?"
01:02:16;01:02:17;"If you got it, flaunt it."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"I mean, I want to do that one day, I think."
01:02:19;01:02:21;"Although then would I have to, like, manscape?"
01:02:21;01:02:22;"Yeah, you might."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"Not necessarily."
01:02:23;01:02:24;"Some people like--"
01:02:24;01:02:25;"It depends what you're going for."
01:02:25;01:02:30;"But yeah, I definitely feel like ""Latter Day Vampire Weekend"""
01:02:30;01:02:31;"needs no shirt."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"I mean, like, when you do the Jersey album."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"Right."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"""TaylorCaster."""
01:02:35;01:02:37;"Because, like, yeah, Bruce got jacked for ""Born in the USA."""
01:02:37;01:02:38;"That's right."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"And that was a game changer for him."
01:02:39;01:02:40;"Game changer."
01:02:40;01:02:41;"Yeah."
01:02:41;01:02:42;"You explain that to me."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"Yeah, because people think of that as, like, this artistic"
01:02:44;01:02:45;"change."
01:02:45;01:02:47;"But the funny thing is, like, first and foremost,"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"it was a body change."
01:02:49;01:02:52;"8-Track tells me in LA they call it a body transformation."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"Like, oh, are you doing a body transformation?"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"Like, they say that super seriously."
01:02:56;01:02:57;"Oh, like it's a thing."
01:02:57;01:02:59;"Well, Harley, your boy."
01:02:59;01:03:00;"Oh, the trainer?"
01:03:00;01:03:01;"Yeah."
01:03:01;01:03:02;"Oh, yeah."
01:03:02;01:03:03;"Oh, he's, like, so--"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"That's one of his things."
01:03:04;01:03:06;"Like, so are we doing a body transformation here?"
01:03:06;01:03:07;"OK, great."
01:03:07;01:03:08;"Right, well, it becomes a narrative."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"Right."
01:03:09;01:03:11;"Like Chris Pratt, it was a narrative that he got jacked."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"And now he's a movie star."
01:03:13;01:03:14;"Right."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"Yeah, I mean, it's not a bad narrative."
01:03:16;01:03:18;"We're coming up on-- it's the holiday season."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"We're coming up on New Year's."
01:03:19;01:03:21;"And you know what people say a lot when it's New Year's?"
01:03:21;01:03:22;"New year, new me."
01:03:22;01:03:23;"Man."
01:03:23;01:03:25;"It's often about body transformation."
01:03:25;01:03:27;"I think you're putting yourself-- I think you're"
01:03:27;01:03:30;"setting yourself up, and you're talking about this with your"
01:03:30;01:03:34;"fans right now, and all your online community is listening."
01:03:34;01:03:37;"And I think we should just-- I think we should create a hashtag"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"right now, #NewEzra."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"Yeah, you've got--"
01:03:39;01:03:40;"#NewEzra."
01:03:40;01:03:41;"Yeah, #NewEzra, #NewEzraBot."
01:03:41;01:03:43;"I don't know how you guys feel about this."
01:03:43;01:03:46;"Yeah, this is probably going to go about as well as New Coke."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"[laughter]"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"Which is a reference not everybody's going to get,"
01:03:50;01:03:53;"but you can Google it."
01:03:53;01:03:55;"You have no interest in being jacked, right, Div?"
01:03:55;01:03:57;"It's not like a friend thing that we could do, like we both"
01:03:57;01:03:58;"try to get jacked together?"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"I feel like that wasn't a nice thing to say."
01:04:00;01:04:01;"That wasn't a nice assumption."
01:04:01;01:04:03;"No, I didn't take it wrong."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"I'm OK."
01:04:04;01:04:07;"You clearly are not interested in being very strong."
01:04:07;01:04:11;"Well, here's the thing is I don't see it as a strength--"
01:04:11;01:04:14;"I mean, the strength thing-- like, the strength thing is like"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"sort of an ancillary benefit, you know?"
01:04:16;01:04:18;"It's just aesthetics, right?"
01:04:18;01:04:19;"I mean, you don't really have to--"
01:04:19;01:04:20;"You don't have to get strong."
01:04:20;01:04:22;"You don't have to really-- I mean, it's just--"
01:04:22;01:04:23;"I think it's just a looks thing."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"And if you're stronger, then great, you know?"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"But I mean, core strength, you can do--"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"I mean, you've got people that got crazy core strength"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"and they don't look-- they don't have the ripped thing, right?"
01:04:31;01:04:32;"That's true."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"So we're just really talking about being able to play"
01:04:34;01:04:35;"with our shirts off."
01:04:35;01:04:36;"And I think as--"
01:04:36;01:04:37;"Purely aesthetic."
01:04:38;01:04:41;"And I think, I mean, you know, I think if you're going to do it"
01:04:41;01:04:44;"and you want to-- I mean, if you want to do, like,"
01:04:44;01:04:46;"a coordinated body transformation,"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"I think we could talk about that if the hashtag is right."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"[laughter]"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"All right, let's think about that."
01:04:52;01:04:54;"Hashtag, and in the meantime--"
01:04:54;01:04:57;"Well, for now, for now, it's the one about you."
01:04:57;01:04:58;"And then--"
01:04:58;01:04:59;"New Ezra."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"And then New Dave."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"It's a little long."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"All right."
01:05:02;01:05:04;"New Ezra, New Dave."
01:05:04;01:05:05;"Let's think about it."
01:05:05;01:05:08;"2016 is going to be an interesting year."
01:05:08;01:05:11;"And here's a woman who knows a thing or two about transformation."
01:05:11;01:05:14;"Annie Lennox with ""Walking on Broken Glass."""
01:05:14;01:05:16;"[music - annie lennox, ""walking on broken glass""]"
01:05:16;01:05:22;"Walking on, walking on broken glass."
01:05:23;01:05:28;"Walking on, walking on broken glass."
01:05:28;01:05:41;"You were the sweetest thing that I ever knew."
01:05:41;01:05:49;"But I don't care for sugar, honey, if I can't have you."
01:05:49;01:05:57;"Since you abandoned me, my whole life has crashed."
01:05:57;01:06:00;"Won't you pick the pieces up?"
01:06:00;01:06:06;"Because it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass."
01:06:06;01:06:09;"Walking on, walking on broken glass."
01:06:09;01:06:18;"Walking on, walking on broken glass."
01:06:19;01:06:22;"Walking on, walking on broken glass."
01:06:22;01:06:32;"The sun's still shining in the deep blue sky,"
01:06:32;01:06:36;"but it don't mean nothing to me."
01:06:36;01:06:40;"Oh, let the rain come down."
01:06:40;01:06:44;"Let the wind blow through me."
01:06:44;01:06:48;"With all the windows smashed."
01:06:48;01:06:51;"But I've got so little left to lose"
01:06:51;01:06:56;"that it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass."
01:06:56;01:07:00;"Walking on, walking on broken glass."
01:07:00;01:07:09;"And if you're trying to cut me down,"
01:07:09;01:07:13;"you know that I might bleed."
01:07:13;01:07:18;"Because if you try to cut me down,"
01:07:18;01:07:22;"I know that you'll succeed."
01:07:22;01:07:26;"And if you want to hurt me,"
01:07:26;01:07:30;"there's nothing left to fear."
01:07:30;01:07:34;"Because if you want to hurt me,"
01:07:34;01:07:39;"you're doing really well, my dear."
01:07:43;01:07:52;"Now, every one of us was made to suffer."
01:07:52;01:07:56;"Every one of us was made to weep."
01:07:56;01:08:00;"We've been hurting one another."
01:08:00;01:08:04;"Now the pain has got to be."
01:08:04;01:08:08;"So take me from the wreckage."
01:08:08;01:08:12;"Save me from the blast."
01:08:12;01:08:15;"Lift me up and take me back."
01:08:15;01:08:19;"Don't let me keep on walking."
01:08:19;01:08:23;"I can't keep on walking."
01:08:23;01:08:27;"Keep on walking on broken glass."
01:08:27;01:08:30;"Walking on, walking on broken glass."
01:08:30;01:08:38;"Walking on, walking on broken glass."
01:08:38;01:08:42;"Walking on, walking on broken glass."
01:08:42;01:08:46;"Walking on, walking on broken glass."
01:09:06;01:09:09;"[laughter]"
01:09:09;01:09:10;"I'm saying--"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"I jacked walking on broken glass for Horchata."
01:09:12;01:09:13;"You told me that."
01:09:13;01:09:15;"No, I said I like that song."
01:09:15;01:09:16;"No, I was deliberate."
01:09:16;01:09:17;"I remember this."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"No."
01:09:18;01:09:19;"OK."
01:09:19;01:09:20;"You play too much."
01:09:20;01:09:21;"I said I like that song."
01:09:21;01:09:22;"So to segue--"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"I said I like that song."
01:09:24;01:09:26;"I think at the time when Horchata came out,"
01:09:26;01:09:29;"a lot of people thought it sounded more like Coldplay."
01:09:29;01:09:31;"[humming]"
01:09:31;01:09:32;"Not at all."
01:09:32;01:09:34;"[humming]"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"I don't know the Coldplay song."
01:09:36;01:09:38;"I think Horchata and Walking on Broken Glass"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"is that they both low key have like a salsa feel."
01:09:40;01:09:41;"That's right."
01:09:41;01:09:44;"[humming]"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"[laughter]"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"[humming]"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"[laughter]"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"That's one thing I love about Annie Lennox."
01:09:52;01:09:54;"Yeah, Ross and I both love that song."
01:09:54;01:09:55;"It's Walking on Broken Glass."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"You know you're such a great beatboxer."
01:09:57;01:09:58;"Salsa."
01:09:58;01:10:00;"Well, he only does salsa in his repertoire, by the way."
01:10:00;01:10:02;"You know, back when I was a teenager, I used to--"
01:10:02;01:10:03;"You're a salsero."
01:10:03;01:10:04;"I used to--"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"With my mouth."
01:10:06;01:10:06;"I used to--"
01:10:06;01:10:09;"I'm the original salsa beatboxer."
01:10:09;01:10:11;"I used to want to be like Razzel."
01:10:11;01:10:12;"Oh, wow."
01:10:12;01:10:14;"Which people-- some of the younger kids"
01:10:14;01:10:15;"might not know about."
01:10:15;01:10:16;"[bark]"
01:10:16;01:10:17;"I don't even want to try."
01:10:17;01:10:18;"Do it."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"I want to be like--"
01:10:20;01:10:22;"What's something that he might scratch?"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"It would be like Razzel, Godfather of Noise."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"[barking]"
01:10:26;01:10:27;"That just sounds like a dog."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"Or he could also--"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"I used to be able to do that thing where you do like--"
01:10:30;01:10:31;"Dog being a scepter."
01:10:31;01:10:32;"[growling]"
01:10:32;01:10:33;"Oh, wow."
01:10:33;01:10:34;"I don't think I can do it anymore."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"You are now listening to the incredible--"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"I lost like that--"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"It's from singing falsetto all these years."
01:10:40;01:10:41;"I can't do it anymore."
01:10:41;01:10:42;"I used to be able to--"
01:10:42;01:10:43;"He used to do the throat singing thing."
01:10:43;01:10:45;"You are now listening--"
01:10:45;01:10:46;"I lost it."
01:10:46;01:10:47;"Let's listen to something from Razzel."
01:10:47;01:10:48;"Damn shame."
01:10:48;01:10:49;"That was a good attempt."
01:10:49;01:10:50;"Let's listen to something from Razzel."
01:10:50;01:10:54;"And now, ladies and gentlemen, in your right corner,"

01:15:34;01:15:36;"but you're gonna be coming back more often."
01:15:36;01:15:37;">> Yeah."
01:15:37;01:15:38;"I mean, we got it on paper now, right?"
01:15:38;01:15:39;">> Now we have it on paper."
01:15:39;01:15:43;">> There's a schedule and there's an agreement and your lawyer talked to my lawyer."
01:15:43;01:15:44;">> Exactly."
01:15:44;01:15:45;"We hammered out the details."
01:15:45;01:15:46;"So we appreciate it."
01:15:46;01:15:47;"Thank you, Dave."
01:15:47;01:15:48;">> Thank you."

01:18:57;01:19:01;"We're talking about the Bodega Boys themselves, Desus and Mero."
01:19:01;01:19:02;">> How's it going?"
01:19:02;01:19:03;">> Gentlemen, please introduce yourselves."

01:19:22;01:19:23;">> Yeah. >> Yeah."
01:19:23;01:19:25;">> Well, for one thing, I don't think Bodega Boys existed yet."
01:19:25;01:19:26;">> No. >> No."
01:19:26;01:19:28;">> Okay, so first of all, for anybody who doesn't know,"
01:19:28;01:19:32;"maybe you know Desus and Mero from Twitter, maybe you remember Desus versus Mero."
01:19:32;01:19:33;">> Right."
01:19:33;01:19:38;">> Which was the original podcast, but now, and I would say this is literally the best podcast around."

01:19:56;01:19:57;">> It's very lit."
01:19:57;01:19:58;">> It's getting up there."

01:20:08;01:20:10;">> Yeah. >> Yeah, we was up there."
01:20:10;01:20:12;">> I want to say everybody, we got to get this top ten."
01:20:12;01:20:13;">> We're trying."
01:20:13;01:20:15;">> How do you get it top ten? Is it like the more you listen to it?"
01:20:15;01:20:18;">> The more people subscribe and listen and raise it."
01:20:18;01:20:21;">> Okay, so everybody's got it. So even if you don't want to listen to it, just subscribe."
01:20:21;01:20:22;">> Yeah, just subscribe and delete it."
01:20:22;01:20:25;">> And if you are going to listen, you should just play it on loop while you sleep."

01:23:35;01:23:36;"Yo. Oh, thank you."
01:23:36;01:23:38;"You know what I'm saying? We're out here. This is crazy. This is like mad New York."
01:23:38;01:23:40;"You know what I'm saying? There's mad buildings and lights."
01:23:40;01:23:41;"You know we're on radio, right? Yeah."
01:23:41;01:23:43;"They can't see us. They can't see me, but I'm like, ""Hey,"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"what's your show?"" Like I said, I'm taking you there. I'm like"
01:23:45;01:23:47;"the Nas of radio. That's right."
01:23:47;01:23:51;"We should tell everybody that we're on a high floor of a beautiful building."
01:23:51;01:23:52;"You know what I'm saying? It's mad nice out here."
01:23:52;01:23:57;"So what's Thanksgiving like for you guys? Oh, Thanksgiving, a day to stuff your face."
01:23:57;01:23:59;"Yeah. You eat so much that it hurts. Yeah."
01:23:59;01:24:01;"Physically. You know what I'm saying? Like you're supposed to do that."
01:24:01;01:24:04;"You could be a glutton and it's socially acceptable. Like any other day of the year,"
01:24:04;01:24:08;"if you made yourself a plate of food the size of the plate of food you make on Thanksgiving,"
01:24:08;01:24:11;"people would send you to rehab because clearly you have an eating disorder."
01:24:11;01:24:12;"Yeah. You'd be on TLC on some wild-"
01:24:12;01:24:17;"You can drink gravy. You can drink gravy out of a cup on Thanksgiving and no one will bat an eye."
01:24:17;01:24:19;"It's the most American of holidays."
01:24:19;01:24:20;"That's true. Yeah."
01:24:20;01:24:22;"Everybody gets to celebrate it. You know what I'm saying?"
01:24:22;01:24:25;"You know what I'm saying? And you see people you haven't seen in mad long,"
01:24:25;01:24:28;"you know what I mean? That you might, may or may not actually f*** with on a regular basis."
01:24:28;01:24:30;"You know what I'm saying? That you have to see because they're family."
01:24:30;01:24:34;"But just because you're family doesn't mean you rock with them. Like you might see a cousin"
01:24:34;01:24:38;"that blocked you on Facebook. You might see your aunt that's still sending you candy crush invites."
01:24:38;01:24:42;"You know, you might have to explain to your aunt, you got your new girlfriend and she's like,"
01:24:42;01:24:45;"what happened to the old one? I liked her better. And she says it out loud in front of her."
01:24:45;01:24:48;"DT Evette always does that. Always."
01:24:48;01:24:53;"Oh, I like Julia better. She was more nicer. She went to school. She had the certificate from"
01:24:53;01:24:56;"a role. She was a phlebotomist. Your last girlfriend was cuter."
01:24:56;01:24:59;"How old are you? You look older than that. You have old skin."
01:24:59;01:25:03;"You got old skin. Your DJ will tell your girl she got old skin."
01:25:03;01:25:05;"Straight up. Don't even blink."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"Straight up. And then throw the Stevie B on a CD changer."
01:25:07;01:25:12;"So guys, we've been in LA for time crisis a lot, but it's good to be back in New York"
01:25:12;01:25:17;"because we kicked off a segment last time you guys were on. And that was one that we like to call"
01:25:17;01:25:18;"New York News. Yeah."
01:25:19;01:25:21;"This is New York News."
01:25:21;01:25:25;"Things got really fancy since the first episode."
01:25:25;01:25:26;"It was like a role playing game."
01:25:26;01:25:28;"It was like a Michael Bay sound effect."
01:25:28;01:25:33;"Our producers printed us out a bunch of news. I haven't really looked at them too much yet, but"
01:25:33;01:25:36;"I figured who better to comment on New York News than Desus Merrow and Despot."
01:25:36;01:25:38;"As local as local news gets."
01:25:38;01:25:42;"It's pretty local. You know, New York News is always a little bit international. So the first"
01:25:42;01:25:49;"one is mafia will take on ISIS if terrorists launch attack on New York mobster's son claims."
01:25:49;01:25:53;"So this is one of the Gambino's right?"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"Yeah. Giovanni Gambino."
01:25:55;01:25:55;"Well, throwback."
01:25:55;01:26:00;"That was John Gambino."
01:26:00;01:26:00;"Yeah."
01:26:00;01:26:03;"Wow. Gambino's."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"Where is he? Where is he live? Howard Beach?"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"He lives at Country Club over there by uh."
01:26:07;01:26:08;"Our South Jersey."
01:26:08;01:26:08;"Yeah."
01:26:08;01:26:10;"Across the bridge over there."
01:26:10;01:26:10;"Wow."
01:26:10;01:26:11;"He's still good."
01:26:11;01:26:13;"He's really like going old school. He said the world is dangerous today,"
01:26:13;01:26:17;"but people living in New York neighborhoods with Sicilian connections should feel safe."
01:26:17;01:26:21;"Yo, Max's girlfriend's mom used to say that. She was like 90 years old and wild racist."
01:26:21;01:26:22;"Yeah."
01:26:22;01:26:26;"We make our friends and family and protected from extremists and terrorists, especially the brutal"
01:26:26;01:26:29;"sociopathic organization that calls it Islamic State."
01:26:29;01:26:31;"This neighborhood was good. You know, you know, I'm not gonna."
01:26:31;01:26:33;"You know, back when it wasn't as brown."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"In lighter news."
01:26:34;01:26:40;"According to New York Post, page six, where I get a lot of my gossip from."
01:26:40;01:26:41;"Oh, so good."
01:26:41;01:26:44;"Carly Simon says that Sean Connery asked for a three-way with her sister"
01:26:44;01:26:46;"and they turned him down."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"Sean Connery?"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"Sean Connery, a former James Bond."
01:26:49;01:26:50;"Wait, when did this happen? Like now or?"
01:26:50;01:26:51;"Sean Connery was from Alka-Farsh."
01:26:51;01:26:53;"When they were younger. Either way, it's still kind of hot."
01:26:53;01:26:54;"He was from Alka-Farsh."
01:26:54;01:27:00;"But Carly Simon did it, right? Just not with her sister. Didn't she still let Sean Connery smash?"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"Sean Connery probably thought that song was about him."
01:27:02;01:27:03;"Maybe."
01:27:03;01:27:03;"Hey."
01:27:03;01:27:08;"Maybe the sister did. I feel like this is kind of like a trend. I don't know if it's because"
01:27:08;01:27:14;"maybe now like gender politics changing and more women feel comfortable speaking out."
01:27:14;01:27:17;"But you get a lot of these like throwbacks from like the 60s."
01:27:17;01:27:18;"Yeah."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"You know what it is? It's like people write their memoirs."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"Right."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"And suddenly then like all like the kind of dirt comes up."
01:27:23;01:27:24;"Things were wild back then."
01:27:24;01:27:24;"Yeah, it was crazy."
01:27:24;01:27:26;"Do some wild back in the day."
01:27:26;01:27:27;"I feel like you could just say that as a blanket statement."
01:27:27;01:27:29;"Like, yo, if you were a dude in the 60s, you were out here wild."
01:27:29;01:27:30;"60s and 70s."
01:27:30;01:27:31;"Doing wild stuff."
01:27:31;01:27:36;"Babylon the Great has fallen."
01:27:36;01:27:38;"I think that wraps up the news."
01:27:38;01:27:40;"I hope that was that was informative."
01:27:40;01:27:43;"What Lil Wayne song should we listen to?"
01:27:43;01:27:44;"Mo Fire."
01:27:44;01:27:50;"No, this is to the one where Bobby Valentino pretends he's a siren and we allowed him to do it."
01:27:50;01:27:51;"Yo, shout out to this woman."
01:27:51;01:27:53;"Yo, who else on the party here?"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"She's called like Miss Officer."
01:27:55;01:27:56;"Miss Police Lady."
01:27:56;01:27:58;"Oh, yes. From the Carter III."
01:27:58;01:27:58;"Yes."
01:27:58;01:28:00;"That's lit."
01:28:01;01:28:02;"Yeah."
01:28:02;01:28:04;"Yeah."
01:28:04;01:28:30;"Bobby Valentino."
01:28:30;01:28:31;"No."
01:28:31;01:28:38;"Bobby Valentino."
01:28:39;01:28:41;"No."
01:28:41;01:28:45;"We."
01:28:45;01:28:53;"I make you say."
01:28:53;01:28:56;"Doing the book in the latest trap."
01:28:56;01:28:58;"I got stopped by a lady cop."
01:28:58;01:29:01;"She got me thinking I could date a cop."
01:29:01;01:29:05;"Because I uniform pants are so tight."
01:29:05;01:29:06;"She read me my rights."
01:29:06;01:29:07;"She put me in a car."
01:29:07;01:29:09;"She cut off all the lights."
01:29:09;01:29:10;"She said I had the right."
01:29:10;01:29:12;"To be made silent."
01:29:12;01:29:15;"Now I got a high that sounded like a siren."
01:29:15;01:29:15;"Talking about."
01:29:15;01:29:25;"And I know she's a law and she know I'm the bar and she know I could have a book."
01:29:25;01:29:28;"The law and she know I'm wrong."
01:29:28;01:29:32;"She know I'm from the street and all she want me to do is the police."
01:29:32;01:29:33;"Talking about."
01:29:38;01:29:41;"When I get up."
01:29:41;01:29:43;"Angels calling."
01:29:43;01:29:43;"Us."
01:29:43;01:29:46;"You can see the sun rise before us."
01:29:46;01:29:48;"And when I'm in the thing I make it."
01:29:48;01:29:49;"By the side."
01:29:49;01:29:49;"I make it."
01:29:49;01:29:55;"Like a cop."
01:29:55;01:30:01;"I make you say."
01:30:01;01:30:04;"And after we got done."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"I said lady wish you number she said."
01:30:06;01:30:07;"911."
01:30:07;01:30:07;"I."

01:30:15;01:30:18;"I make wearing under handcuffs and heels."
01:30:18;01:30:21;"Then I beat it like a cop."
01:30:21;01:30:22;"Find the king baby."
01:30:22;01:30:24;"Yeah I beat it like a cow."
01:30:24;01:30:27;"Beat it like a cow."
01:30:27;01:30:28;"Ride the king baby."
01:30:28;01:30:29;"Said beat it like a cow."
01:30:29;01:30:33;"But I ain't trying to be violent."
01:30:33;01:30:34;"But I do the time."
01:30:34;01:30:36;"But the hurt love is timeless."
01:30:37;01:30:37;"Mrs."
01:30:37;01:30:38;"Officer."
01:30:38;01:30:40;"I know you wish your name was Mrs."

01:33:04;01:33:05;"She got the chair."
01:33:05;01:33:06;"And she sits in the chair."
01:33:06;01:33:07;"And does a little dance."
01:33:07;01:33:08;"And he's rapping at her."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"And it was the corniest thing I've ever seen."
01:33:10;01:33:10;"Oh my god."
01:33:10;01:33:12;"I love how rappers when they bring people."
01:33:12;01:33:12;"I say it's just like."
01:33:12;01:33:13;"There's no imagination in it."
01:33:13;01:33:14;"Like."
01:33:14;01:33:15;"They never like ask like."
01:33:15;01:33:16;"Maybe a stage director."
01:33:16;01:33:17;"Like what vision do you see here."
01:33:17;01:33:18;"They're like no."
01:33:18;01:33:19;"Get a woman."
01:33:19;01:33:20;"The song's about cops."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"Pop her throat on a uniform."
01:33:21;01:33:21;"And shake her cheeks."
01:33:21;01:33:22;"That's it."
01:33:22;01:33:23;"Go to Frederick's Hollywood."
01:33:23;01:33:24;"Get a cop uniform."
01:33:24;01:33:25;"And then when people ask like."
01:33:25;01:33:26;"Why did you have that woman."
01:33:26;01:33:27;"Why were you exploiting her."
01:33:27;01:33:27;"He was like no."
01:33:27;01:33:28;"It was a statement against police brutality."
01:33:28;01:33:31;"You can rock with that."
01:33:31;01:33:32;"You can."
01:33:32;01:33:33;"I'm just gonna rock it with that."
01:33:33;01:33:34;"So guys."
01:33:34;01:33:35;"When you were first on Time Crisis."
01:33:35;01:33:37;"We christened a segment on the show."
01:33:37;01:33:38;"That we've done every time since."
01:33:38;01:33:40;"And that's exploring."
01:33:40;01:33:41;"Trends."
01:33:41;01:33:42;"The zeitgeist."

01:33:45;01:33:45;"Top five."
01:33:45;01:33:47;"Have you guys been keeping up with pop music?"
01:33:47;01:33:48;"A little bit."
01:33:48;01:33:48;"You know what I'm saying."

01:34:32;01:34:33;"So Adele."
01:34:33;01:34:35;"Adele this week broke a record."
01:34:35;01:34:36;"It's the best selling."
01:34:36;01:34:37;"In 2015."
01:34:37;01:34:38;"It's crazy."
01:34:38;01:34:41;"It's the best selling album week ever."
01:34:41;01:34:42;"Oh no."
01:34:42;01:34:42;"Maybe not ever."
01:34:42;01:34:43;"But at least in the."
01:34:43;01:34:43;"Yes."
01:34:43;01:34:44;"Up there."
01:34:44;01:34:45;"15, 20 years."
01:34:45;01:34:47;"Yo Adele was selling copies of her album."
01:34:47;01:34:47;"Like it's the Bible."
01:34:47;01:34:48;"This is ridiculous."
01:34:48;01:34:49;"Like how does she do it with these numbers."
01:34:49;01:34:50;"It's crazy."
01:34:50;01:34:50;"This song."
01:34:50;01:34:52;"They gotta be selling this joint at the gas station or something."
01:34:52;01:34:55;"Because it's like yo you could really find this joint anywhere."
01:34:55;01:34:55;"Right."
01:34:55;01:34:56;"Everyone has this."
01:34:56;01:34:56;"Yo."
01:34:56;01:34:57;"It's like Jehovah's Witnesses."
01:34:57;01:34:59;"This song's gonna start a book fam."
01:34:59;01:35:00;"She's right there next to Pentatonix."
01:35:00;01:35:03;"I think those kids in the subway they're selling candy and Adele albums."
01:35:03;01:35:04;"They go."
01:35:04;01:35:06;"I'm not selling this for my own money."
01:35:06;01:35:08;"I'm doing this to buy uniforms."
01:35:08;01:35:10;"Also here's Adele's album."
01:35:10;01:35:10;"Hello."
01:35:10;01:35:11;"I got peanut M&M's."
01:35:11;01:35:13;"I got Adele's album."
01:35:13;01:35:14;"I got Jolly Ranchers."
01:35:14;01:35:15;"All we got left is Adele's album."
01:35:15;01:35:16;"That's it."
01:35:16;01:35:17;"That's it."
01:35:17;01:35:18;"Have a blast day."
01:35:18;01:35:23;"Supporting the basketball teams of America."
01:35:23;01:35:25;"Here's Adele at number five with When We Were Young."
01:35:25;01:35:30;"I never heard this."
01:35:30;01:35:31;"Huh?"
01:35:31;01:35:32;"I just heard the one song."
01:35:32;01:35:33;"Yeah wait have you guys heard this one?"
01:35:33;01:35:34;"When Mack Wiles?"
01:35:34;01:35:34;"I haven't heard this."
01:35:34;01:35:37;"I'm probably gonna be hearing it forever."
01:35:37;01:35:43;"Everybody loves the things you do."
01:35:44;01:35:49;"From the way you talk to the way you move."
01:35:49;01:35:57;"Everybody here is watching you."
01:35:57;01:36:00;"Cause you feel like home."
01:36:00;01:36:04;"You're like a dream come true."
01:36:04;01:36:07;"Yo this is like the loneliest lonely b**** music man."
01:36:07;01:36:13;"This is a whole thing of Edie's, Dolo tunes."
01:36:13;01:36:16;"I'm gonna have a moment before I go."
01:36:16;01:36:21;"This is where I put ice cream on a chocolate chip cookie."
01:36:21;01:36:24;"I just had to remind myself all night long."
01:36:24;01:36:30;"Hoping you're someone I used to know."
01:36:30;01:36:34;"You look like a movie."
01:36:34;01:36:37;"You sound like a song."
01:36:39;01:36:44;"My god this reminds me of when we were young."
01:36:44;01:36:49;"Let me photograph you in this light."
01:36:49;01:36:55;"In case it is the last time that we might be together."
01:36:55;01:36:56;"You guys get the idea."
01:36:56;01:37:00;"Yo listen somebody on Grey's Anatomy is either gonna smash or die to that."
01:37:00;01:37:01;"No Grey's Anatomy can't afford that."
01:37:01;01:37:01;"Yo."
01:37:01;01:37:02;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:37:02;01:37:05;"I want to ruin a woman's life."
01:37:05;01:37:06;"Whoever ruined Adele's life."
01:37:06;01:37:07;"Oh on that level."
01:37:07;01:37:10;"She's making beautiful heart break music."
01:37:10;01:37:12;"None of my ex-girlfriends would ever make a song like that."
01:37:12;01:37:13;"What?"
01:37:13;01:37:14;"Maybe like Happy Day."
01:37:14;01:37:14;"Come on."
01:37:14;01:37:15;"Something really upbeat."
01:37:15;01:37:16;"Yeah."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"4/4 on the drums."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"Cheerleader was what my ex wrote."
01:37:18;01:37:19;"Oh man."
01:37:19;01:37:19;"My ex wrote that."
01:37:19;01:37:21;"Shout out to Omi."
01:37:21;01:37:23;"That song's produced by Ariel Rekshad."
01:37:23;01:37:25;"Co-producer of the Last Vampire Weekend album."
01:37:25;01:37:26;"Shout out to him."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"Shout out to Ariel."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"Nobody can have any problem, couldn't possibly have a problem with"
01:37:29;01:37:30;"When We Were Young by Adele."
01:37:30;01:37:30;"Alec?"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"You like it?"
01:37:32;01:37:33;"I mean."
01:37:33;01:37:35;"It's a sad song."
01:37:35;01:37:36;"I don't care about it."
01:37:36;01:37:37;"I don't care."
01:37:37;01:37:38;"You don't hate it or love it."
01:37:38;01:37:41;"I guess I'm not gonna tell you that I hate the song."
01:37:41;01:37:41;"Okay."
01:37:41;01:37:42;"I might."
01:37:42;01:37:44;"But I definitely don't like it."
01:37:44;01:37:45;"I don't care about it."
01:37:45;01:37:46;"Nobody wants to hate on Adele."
01:37:46;01:37:47;"It's like air."
01:37:47;01:37:48;"Nah, nah."
01:37:48;01:37:49;"I don't hate on Adele."
01:37:49;01:37:50;"It's like bland."
01:37:50;01:37:51;"It's emotionless."
01:37:51;01:37:53;"I mean it's emotional but it's emotionless."
01:37:53;01:37:54;"I'm like she's going through something."
01:37:54;01:37:58;"That's funny because what everybody says about Adele is like she instantly makes you feel emotion."
01:37:58;01:37:59;"I don't."
01:37:59;01:38:01;"Maybe her first album but I feel like she's melting it now."
01:38:01;01:38:02;"Like she's just like yo."
01:38:02;01:38:03;"How sad are you gonna be?"
01:38:03;01:38:04;"You know what's crazy?"
01:38:04;01:38:04;"Come on."
01:38:05;01:38:06;"Come out your house."
01:38:06;01:38:06;"The breakup's over."
01:38:06;01:38:09;"It's like 500 days of summer."
01:38:09;01:38:12;"Eventually you gotta take your robe off and stop going to the store."
01:38:12;01:38:13;"Listen, you got more than one pair of leggings, man."
01:38:13;01:38:14;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:38:14;01:38:15;"I know you do."
01:38:15;01:38:18;"This artist is called Amy Vachelle."
01:38:18;01:38:18;"Vachelle."
01:38:18;01:38:19;"I don't know."
01:38:19;01:38:19;"Okay."
01:38:19;01:38:21;"That sounds like what my Italian neighbor used to call me."
01:38:21;01:38:22;"Taking points off his name."
01:38:22;01:38:23;"Hey, Vachelle."
01:38:23;01:38:24;"Get out of here."
01:38:24;01:38:25;"What are you doing?"
01:38:25;01:38:26;"Amy Brachelle."
01:38:26;01:38:28;"You smoking a papaya in my yard."
01:38:28;01:38:32;"And this is her performance of Blank Space by Taylor Swift on The Voice."
01:38:32;01:38:32;"Oh."
01:38:32;01:38:33;"Okay."
01:38:44;01:38:45;"That's why I was loving this one."
01:38:45;01:38:47;"I've heard this."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"Oh, this is kind of like the cutesy indie version."
01:39:04;01:39:05;"Yeah."
01:39:05;01:39:07;"Is that a ukulele version?"
01:39:07;01:39:07;"It is."
01:39:08;01:39:08;"You know it is."
01:39:08;01:39:14;"This shit makes me want to buy every cell phone."
01:39:30;01:39:32;"That's what Zooey Deschanel's heartbeat sounds like."
01:39:32;01:39:35;"[Laughter]"
01:39:35;01:39:36;"Got him!"
01:39:44;01:39:45;"Okay, first of all."
01:39:45;01:39:46;"I feel like you ought to be sitting on a sled to hear that."
01:39:46;01:39:50;"It really makes the original seem like a banger."
01:39:50;01:39:51;"Yeah, that's true."
01:39:51;01:39:52;"Makes the original seem edgy."
01:39:52;01:39:54;"It does make the original seem edgy."
01:39:54;01:39:54;"Yeah."
01:39:54;01:39:58;"I mean, look, well, first of all, The Voice is first and foremost about having a good voice."
01:39:58;01:40:00;"So, no, we can't frown on Amy."
01:40:00;01:40:01;"Clearly, you have a beautiful voice."
01:40:01;01:40:03;"You got to buy a Starbucks gift card to that."
01:40:03;01:40:04;"Shout out to the glockenspiel in there, though."
01:40:04;01:40:05;"Yeah."
01:40:05;01:40:07;"Ain't no glockenspiel in music nowadays."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"I want to run in the studio when they were doing that and just grab the glockenspiel"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"and just smash that shit on the ground, fam."
01:40:11;01:40:14;"It definitely does not hold a candle to the original."
01:40:14;01:40:15;"No, not at all."
01:40:15;01:40:17;"But, you know, I don't want to hate on like an upcoming artist."
01:40:17;01:40:18;"Yeah, nah, me neither."
01:40:18;01:40:19;"No, we're not hating on the artist."
01:40:19;01:40:23;"We're just hating on the song and the instruments and the creation and the volume levels and the"
01:40:23;01:40:25;"modulation and everything that the sound engineer did."
01:40:25;01:40:26;"And the voice and the artist."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"The ukulele has got to go, B."
01:40:28;01:40:31;"What was the last song you knew that had the ukulele and was a banger?"
01:40:31;01:40:34;"Uh, that, uh, that big, uh, that fat Hawaiian guy."
01:40:34;01:40:36;"Yeah, but that was like some day over the rainbow."
01:40:36;01:40:37;"Over the rainbow."
01:40:37;01:40:37;"Yeah."
01:40:37;01:40:39;"I'll tell you what the thing about the ukulele is."
01:40:39;01:40:40;"Rest in peace to that big fat Hawaiian guy."
01:40:40;01:40:42;"Ukulele used to be like a weirdo instrument."
01:40:42;01:40:46;"Either you were like actually like a cool Hawaiian guy or you were like a psycho."
01:40:46;01:40:47;"But then about 10 years ago."
01:40:47;01:40:49;"A cool Hawaiian guy or a psycho."
01:40:49;01:40:50;"Or like a psycho white guy."
01:40:50;01:40:54;"But then about 10 years ago, it became the kind of like, like you were saying, like the"
01:40:54;01:40:57;"kind of, uh, the cutesy indie Target commercial sound."
01:40:57;01:40:59;"And then it just, I don't know."
01:40:59;01:40:59;"Yeah."
01:40:59;01:41:01;"It just lost, you lost all respect for it."
01:41:01;01:41:01;"You know, it's crazy."
01:41:01;01:41:05;"That at one point it was like, yo, you want a million views on YouTube?"
01:41:05;01:41:05;"Yeah."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"Yo, do this Migos song with a ukulele fam."
01:41:07;01:41:07;"All right."
01:41:07;01:41:08;"Pow."
01:41:08;01:41:09;"It's in a platinum."
01:41:09;01:41:09;"Holla at me."
01:41:09;01:41:10;"Okay."
01:41:10;01:41:11;"You guys ready for number three?"
01:41:11;01:41:12;"Ready for number three."
01:41:12;01:41:14;"This is a young man out of Canada."
01:41:14;01:41:16;"A guy who really changed the face of music."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"You know what I'm talking about?"
01:41:17;01:41:20;"He had some rough times, but he's back and he's huge again."
01:41:20;01:41:20;"Show Claire."
01:41:20;01:41:21;"Brian Mayer."
01:41:21;01:41:21;"Who do you think?"
01:41:21;01:41:22;"Cardao Official."
01:41:22;01:41:27;"It's not snow."
01:41:27;01:41:28;"Oh man."
01:41:28;01:41:29;"I don't even want to hear it now."
01:41:29;01:41:30;"Justin Bieber."
01:41:30;01:41:30;"The Biebs."
01:41:30;01:41:33;"All the times that you rain on my parade."
01:41:33;01:41:38;"And all the clubs you get in using my name."
01:41:38;01:41:41;"You think you broke my heart."
01:41:41;01:41:43;"Oh girl, for goodness sake."
01:41:43;01:41:45;"You think I'm crying."
01:41:45;01:41:47;"Justin Bieber tried to fight me once."
01:41:47;01:41:48;"He tried to fight you?"
01:41:48;01:41:49;"At Coachella."
01:41:49;01:41:50;"I know."
01:41:50;01:41:54;"That's a, that's a, yo, I gotta, listen, you guys are recording this."
01:41:54;01:41:56;"Didn't I tell this story before?"
01:41:56;01:41:57;"Not on the, not on Time Crisis."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"Yeah."
01:41:58;01:41:58;"Okay."
01:41:58;01:41:59;"Yeah, tell the story."
01:42:00;01:42:01;"All right."
01:42:01;01:42:01;"F*** this up."
01:42:01;01:42:04;"Everyone in the studio is staring right at this spot right now."
01:42:04;01:42:05;"So what, what happened?"
01:42:05;01:42:06;"Yeah, make it, make it."
01:42:06;01:42:07;"I didn't do anything."
01:42:07;01:42:09;"I actually didn't do, all right, so I was at Coachella."
01:42:09;01:42:11;"I guess this is maybe two Coachellas ago."
01:42:11;01:42:15;"He was, because Justin Bieber was there because he did like, he jumped up with Chance the Rapper."
01:42:15;01:42:18;"They had a song together and he jumped up with that."
01:42:18;01:42:24;"And I was hanging out with Wicky from the rap group Rat King because they had played at like"
01:42:24;01:42:27;"12 p.m. which is, you know, an unfortunate Coachella slot."
01:42:28;01:42:35;"Me and Wicky are sitting by the trailers drinking and I look down on the floor, like right next to"
01:42:35;01:42:40;"me and this girl's laying on the floor and I was like, oh, that girl who's laying on the floor"
01:42:40;01:42:43;"right there is a good looking girl and whatever."
01:42:43;01:42:47;"I keep drinking and I look again and I was like, oh, that's Selena Gomez."
01:42:47;01:42:47;"Okay."
01:42:47;01:42:48;"She was just lying on the floor?"
01:42:48;01:42:51;"Laying on the floor, like, you know, sunglasses on, whatever."
01:42:51;01:42:51;"Oh, okay."
01:42:51;01:42:52;"Just relaxing."
01:42:52;01:42:53;"Yeah, she wasn't dead."
01:42:53;01:42:54;"Oh, I thought she was like passed out."
01:42:54;01:42:56;"She was dead!"
01:42:56;01:42:57;"That changes the story."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"No, she was just chilling."
01:42:59;01:42:59;"Okay."
01:42:59;01:43:04;"And then, you know, Wicky was like, word, that's her, you know, and he looked, yeah,"
01:43:04;01:43:06;"and she hears what we're saying."
01:43:06;01:43:07;"She's right there next to us."
01:43:07;01:43:09;"So she was like, can I have some of that tequila?"
01:43:09;01:43:11;"So he was like, yeah, yeah, come in the trailer."
01:43:11;01:43:14;"We're drinking, you know, in there and whatever."
01:43:14;01:43:19;"We talk a little, come out the trailer and there's Justin Bieber looking like, you know,"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"he was obviously looking for her."
01:43:21;01:43:24;"It's just like, oh, coming out of the trailer with two dudes."
01:43:24;01:43:24;"Okay."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"And, uh."
01:43:26;01:43:27;"Beeps is fed up."
01:43:27;01:43:28;"Damn."
01:43:28;01:43:33;"He picked her up, like immediately picks her up, wraps like her legs around him and walks"
01:43:33;01:43:34;"away with her."
01:43:34;01:43:35;"And we were just like, oh, all right."
01:43:35;01:43:38;"I mean, he looks like he was mad."
01:43:38;01:43:39;"So what do you mean he picks her up?"
01:43:39;01:43:43;"Like, like he like, like she just like, you know, hey, here I am."
01:43:43;01:43:43;"Hey, baby."
01:43:43;01:43:46;"I'm taking this, you know, I'm out."
01:43:46;01:43:46;"Right."
01:43:46;01:43:47;"And he walked away."
01:43:47;01:43:52;"But then he like deposits her not very far from where we were and comes back and does"
01:43:52;01:43:56;"the thing where, you know, he puts his face like as close as he can to, you know, my"
01:43:56;01:43:57;"face and Wicky's face."
01:43:57;01:44:00;"Like, like, yeah, you know, like do something type thing."
01:44:00;01:44:03;"But there's like four giant security guards."
01:44:03;01:44:07;"And I'm kind of like, you know, that at least deserves like a mush."
01:44:07;01:44:09;"Like I should have at least just been like, yeah, man."
01:44:09;01:44:14;"But if I did that, I would have gotten pummeled by these seven foot tall."
01:44:14;01:44:15;"So nothing happened."
01:44:15;01:44:18;"But so Justin Bieber didn't actually say anything to you."
01:44:18;01:44:20;"Not just just the grill, the very close."
01:44:20;01:44:22;"I kind of got to give Justin Bieber props for that."
01:44:22;01:44:23;"That's my weird."
01:44:23;01:44:25;"Not that's my weird."
01:44:25;01:44:28;"I mean, the fact that he would actually just stare you in the face is surprising."
01:44:28;01:44:29;"But that was him flexing."
01:44:29;01:44:33;"That was like, you're not going to do like, oh, yeah, you want to try to take my girl"
01:44:33;01:44:35;"in a trailer, you piece of garbage."
01:44:35;01:44:36;"Did his big homies high five him?"
01:44:36;01:44:39;"They were just watching because he probably does that all the time."
01:44:39;01:44:43;"Like he's allowed to play out whoever he wants to play out because, you know, wow."
01:44:43;01:44:46;"And it's literally like being a prince."
01:44:46;01:44:46;"Yeah."
01:44:46;01:44:47;"It's like a medieval times."
01:44:47;01:44:47;"Yeah."
01:44:47;01:44:49;"Being a prince and like walking through the village."
01:44:49;01:44:50;"You have your knights and everything."
01:44:50;01:44:51;"Exactly."
01:44:51;01:44:52;"You do what you want."
01:44:52;01:44:53;"I'm taking your radishes."
01:44:54;01:44:56;"I'm taking your radishes."
01:44:56;01:44:58;"Strike them down with all your might."
01:44:58;01:45:00;"On that note, let's get into the number two song."
01:45:00;01:45:01;"Guess what?"
01:45:01;01:45:02;"It's by Justin Bieber."
01:45:02;01:45:04;"Here's a song called Sorry."
01:45:04;01:45:06;"This one's going out to Despacito."
01:45:06;01:45:20;"You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty."
01:45:20;01:45:25;"You know, I try, but I don't do too well with apologies."
01:45:25;01:45:29;"I hope I don't run out of time because I want to call a referee."
01:45:29;01:45:34;"Because I just need one more shot at forgiveness."
01:45:35;01:45:39;"I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice."
01:45:39;01:45:41;"About once or twice."
01:45:41;01:45:44;"I mean, maybe a couple of hundred times."
01:45:44;01:45:48;"So let me or let me redeem or redeem on myself tonight."
01:45:48;01:45:53;"Because I just need one more shot at second chances."
01:45:53;01:45:58;"Is it too late now to say sorry?"
01:45:58;01:46:03;"Because I'm missing more than just your body."
01:46:05;01:46:06;"We all know this song."
01:46:06;01:46:09;"So, uh, uh, Jesus, I got a question for you."
01:46:09;01:46:11;"You're you're a man of Jamaican heritage."
01:46:11;01:46:12;"That's right."
01:46:12;01:46:12;"What's going on?"
01:46:12;01:46:12;"What's going on?"
01:46:12;01:46:13;"Wow."
01:46:13;01:46:16;"How do you feel about Justin Bieber becoming the new king of dance?"
01:46:16;01:46:16;"I love it."
01:46:16;01:46:19;"He's picking up where Sean Paul left off."
01:46:19;01:46:20;"You know that song Red Red Wine?"
01:46:20;01:46:21;"Yeah."
01:46:21;01:46:22;"Classic song."
01:46:22;01:46:22;"Right."
01:46:22;01:46:23;"My father loved that song."
01:46:23;01:46:25;"My father would play that song all the time."
01:46:25;01:46:26;"Every barbecue."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"Every no, any time he'd come home from work."
01:46:28;01:46:30;"It's just red, red wine."
01:46:30;01:46:32;"Which the UB40 version."
01:46:32;01:46:32;"Okay."
01:46:32;01:46:33;"The UB40."
01:46:33;01:46:35;"And then and then we didn't have cable."
01:46:35;01:46:37;"When he found out it was white people singing it."
01:46:37;01:46:38;"Because you know, there's some white people."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"You know, right?"
01:46:39;01:46:40;"So he he saw the video."
01:46:40;01:46:42;"I think he saw it on MTV or something."
01:46:42;01:46:44;"He was like his mind was blown for like two weeks."
01:46:44;01:46:45;"You know, it's crazy."
01:46:45;01:46:49;"I think I'm pretty sure you'd be 40 or the best selling reggae artist of all time."
01:46:49;01:46:49;"Yes."
01:46:49;01:46:51;"I saw something like that."
01:46:51;01:46:52;"Bigger than Bob Marley."
01:46:52;01:46:52;"Yeah."
01:46:52;01:46:52;"Wow."
01:46:52;01:46:53;"Yeah."
01:46:53;01:46:53;"You'd be 40."
01:46:53;01:46:54;"Got hits."
01:46:54;01:46:54;"What?"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"Straight out of Birmingham, UK."
01:46:56;01:46:57;"That's a little low key trivia."
01:46:57;01:47:00;"I mean, yo, who's doing numbers like that?"
01:47:00;01:47:01;"Bigger than Bob Marley."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"Yo, we out here."
01:47:02;01:47:03;"What a drink."
01:47:04;01:47:07;"Instead of saying on the road, I do One Direction numbers."
01:47:07;01:47:09;"He was like on the road, I do UB40 numbers."
01:47:09;01:47:12;"All his fans would be like, what's that?"
01:47:12;01:47:14;"Is that the abortion pill?"
01:47:14;01:47:18;"You guys ready for number one song?"
01:47:18;01:47:22;"This is really there's only three artists in the top five this week."
01:47:22;01:47:22;"Wow."
01:47:22;01:47:22;"Is it Fusion?"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"Justin Bieber, Amy, Vachon."
01:47:24;01:47:28;"And again, at Sitting Pretty at number one."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"French Montana."
01:47:29;01:47:30;"Adele."
01:47:30;01:47:36;"Hello."
01:47:36;01:47:39;"It's me."
01:47:39;01:47:43;"I was wondering."
01:47:43;01:47:44;"Damn, bae."
01:47:44;01:47:46;"Don't be sad now."
01:47:46;01:47:47;"Dog."
01:47:47;01:47:51;"To go over everything."
01:47:53;01:47:58;"They say the time supposed to heal you, but I ain't done much."
01:47:58;01:48:00;"Hello."
01:48:00;01:48:04;"Can you hear me?"
01:48:04;01:48:13;"I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be when we were younger."
01:48:13;01:48:16;"And free."
01:48:18;01:48:23;"I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet."
01:48:23;01:48:33;"There's such a difference between us and a million miles."
01:48:33;01:48:39;"Hello from the other side."
01:48:39;01:48:43;"Big voice."
01:48:43;01:48:46;"I must have called a thousand times."
01:48:46;01:48:48;"I have a real problem."
01:48:48;01:48:49;"I keep singing."
01:48:49;01:48:49;"It's crazy."
01:48:49;01:48:53;"I don't know how this got stuck in my head, but I keep singing this song as like a Nickelback or"
01:48:53;01:48:57;"Metallica song, and then I can't stop singing because it really sounds like one."
01:48:57;01:49:00;"Hello from the other side."
01:49:00;01:49:06;"Like once you do that once, you'll always hear it like, ""Hello from the other side."""
01:49:06;01:49:11;"There is something kind of like metal about this song."
01:49:11;01:49:12;"Can we do a version of that?"
01:49:12;01:49:13;"It's a little dark."
01:49:13;01:49:14;"Let's go to the studio right now and do the original."
01:49:14;01:49:19;"It's really like a thin line between kind of like sad pop music and like metal."
01:49:19;01:49:22;"Like Guns N' Roses is like the middle ground."
01:49:22;01:49:24;"There's nothing more metal than love."
01:49:24;01:49:25;"That's right."
01:49:25;01:49:26;"Wow, that's deep."
01:49:26;01:49:26;"That's deep, right?"
01:49:26;01:49:29;"Someone's going to say that and then put like a Marilyn Monroe picture on it."
01:49:29;01:49:30;"I know, it's going to be all over Tumblr."
01:49:30;01:49:32;"This is white people kissing in the rain music."
01:49:32;01:49:34;"This is a genre of music."
01:49:34;01:49:35;"It's called white people kissing in the rain music."
01:49:35;01:49:37;"Adele does appeal to everybody."
01:49:37;01:49:38;"I think it's because she's British."
01:49:38;01:49:42;"If she was American, they probably wouldn't bang her like that."
01:49:42;01:49:42;"I don't know."
01:49:43;01:49:45;"To people in the hood, British people are like aliens."
01:49:45;01:49:46;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:49:46;01:49:47;"It's like they're not even like people."
01:49:47;01:49:49;"It's just like, ""Oh, do you hear that accent?"""
01:49:49;01:49:51;"So when she does an interview, it's like, ""Oh, wow."
01:49:51;01:49:53;"She's from England."
01:49:53;01:49:53;"She's proper."
01:49:53;01:49:54;"She's British."
01:49:54;01:49:55;"We feel like they're better than us."""
01:49:55;01:49:58;"Because you know, we still have that whole, they used to like own the United States."
01:49:58;01:49:59;"They're the big brother."
01:49:59;01:50:04;"They made me talk like this in high school, man, for my literature class."
01:50:04;01:50:06;"I'm saying I'm not with all this might."
01:50:06;01:50:09;"But then in the UK, Adele's a little bit of like a working class hero."
01:50:09;01:50:10;"Yeah?"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"Because like she's from like North London."
01:50:13;01:50:15;"You know how British people, you have family in the UK."
01:50:15;01:50:17;"So you know British people are obsessed with accents."
01:50:17;01:50:17;"Yes."
01:50:17;01:50:20;"In a way that in like whatever, we might like joke about different York accents."
01:50:20;01:50:23;"But in like, it's literally like 10 billion accents."
01:50:23;01:50:26;"And you can tell where somebody's from, like how much money, like their dad's selling."
01:50:26;01:50:27;"Oh, yeah."
01:50:27;01:50:28;"Like right off."
01:50:28;01:50:32;"So there's a thing when Adele, like when she was first on like one of the big late night"
01:50:32;01:50:36;"talk shows and she was talking like the guy, like the guy made a joke like, ""I had no idea"
01:50:36;01:50:37;"you were so common."""
01:50:37;01:50:40;"You know, the same way like Amy Winehouse is like working class."
01:50:40;01:50:43;"But like America, we don't, we can't like tell the difference."
01:50:43;01:50:43;"Right."
01:50:43;01:50:44;"I have a theory about Adele."
01:50:44;01:50:47;"I don't think she would be as poppin and she was like a size four."
01:50:47;01:50:48;"She was skinny?"
01:50:48;01:50:48;"That's true."
01:50:48;01:50:49;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:50:49;01:50:50;"I mean, you could argue."
01:50:50;01:50:53;"I think the big girls vibe were like, ""Yo, she's one of us."""
01:50:53;01:50:55;"She's not threatening to skinnier girls?"
01:50:55;01:50:55;"Yeah."
01:50:55;01:50:57;"Okay, guys, that was the top five."
01:50:57;01:50:57;"Top five."
01:50:57;01:51:01;"We had two Adele songs, two Bieber songs, one Amy Vachelle song."
01:51:01;01:51:03;"What's your pick, Mero?"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"Oh, man, the Bieber joint."
01:51:05;01:51:05;"Sorry."
01:51:05;01:51:06;"The dance off?"
01:51:06;01:51:09;"Yeah, because first of all, first and foremost, because he apologized to Despa, I respect that."
01:51:09;01:51:10;"Yeah."
01:51:10;01:51:11;"I respect that move."
01:51:11;01:51:13;"And secondly, the beat was not good."
01:51:13;01:51:14;"He apologized?"
01:51:14;01:51:14;"Well, in the song."
01:51:14;01:51:15;"Sorry."
01:51:15;01:51:15;"Oh, okay."
01:51:15;01:51:16;"I was like, ""I'm sorry."""
01:51:16;01:51:17;"I was like, ""I'm cool."""
01:51:17;01:51:18;"Desus, your pick?"
01:51:18;01:51:21;"I got to go with the Ukelele girl."
01:51:21;01:51:22;"Oh, I respect it."
01:51:22;01:51:23;"I respect it."
01:51:23;01:51:23;"I respect it."
01:51:23;01:51:25;"I respect it."
01:51:25;01:51:29;"Despa, could you find forgiveness in your heart to choose a Justin Bieber song?"
01:51:29;01:51:31;"Yeah, I'm going with ""Sorry."""
01:51:31;01:51:31;"Wow."
01:51:31;01:51:31;"I appreciate him."
01:51:31;01:51:32;"That's the bigger man."
01:51:32;01:51:33;"That's the bigger man right there."
01:51:33;01:51:36;"Well, you know, he stepped up to the plate."
01:51:36;01:51:38;"He apologized in front of the whole world."
01:51:38;01:51:39;"In front of everybody."
01:51:39;01:51:40;"Over a dance hall beat."
01:51:40;01:51:41;"Yeah."
01:51:41;01:51:42;"International world culture."
01:51:42;01:51:44;"He knew what kind of beat I wanted him to apologize over."
01:51:44;01:51:45;"Somehow he knew."
01:51:45;01:51:48;"He's like, ""I remember what you used to listen to in a dollar van, my G. I got you."""
01:51:48;01:51:49;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:51:49;01:51:50;"That's a classic Jamaican apology."
01:51:50;01:51:51;"You got to get on a remix."
01:51:51;01:51:53;"Yeah, I'm down."
01:51:53;01:51:54;"Bieber, if you're listening."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"Reach out, Biebs."
01:51:55;01:51:56;"Yo, make it happen."
01:51:56;01:51:57;"We could really bury the hatchet on the remix."
01:51:57;01:51:58;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:51:58;01:52:00;"Yo, Bieber, hit me with your new number."
01:52:00;01:52:02;"The one I have for you doesn't work anymore."
01:52:02;01:52:04;"It doesn't work anymore."
01:52:04;01:52:06;"I'm calling you like Adele, man."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"Like, hello?"
01:52:07;01:52:07;"Yo, listen."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"What should we listen to?"
01:52:09;01:52:10;"I never actually listened to it."
01:52:10;01:52:12;"Is the Rick Ross Adele remix good?"
01:52:12;01:52:13;"I haven't heard it."
01:52:13;01:52:14;"You know what?"
01:52:14;01:52:17;"It's a typical Rick Ross thing where clearly somebody was like, ""Yo, Rick Ross, you're"
01:52:17;01:52:18;"going to remix this song?"""
01:52:18;01:52:20;"And Rick Ross is like, ""I'm not listening to the song."
01:52:20;01:52:22;"I'm just going to rap about whatever."""
01:52:22;01:52:26;"So Adele's rapping about love, and then Rick Ross comes talking about Coke and Maybach."
01:52:26;01:52:26;"Yeah."
01:52:26;01:52:28;"All right, we got to listen to it."
01:52:28;01:52:30;"Here's the Rick Ross remix of Adele, ""Hello."""
01:52:31;01:52:34;"Renzo, aka Ricky Rubin."
01:52:34;01:52:39;"I miss you kissing my lips, consoling my confidence."
01:52:39;01:52:42;"Apologies from the heart is something that's heaven sent."
01:52:42;01:52:45;"Scars for the flesh, war wounds for the soul."
01:52:45;01:52:48;"Success is another test and we wanted the highest score."
01:52:48;01:52:51;"Mother did her job, fundamental love."
01:52:51;01:52:54;"But it never was enough, was I born to be a thug?"
01:52:54;01:52:57;"Tears fall all the way to the south of France."
01:52:58;01:53:00;"Poverty line hang lower than my pants."
01:53:00;01:53:03;"Divided to the Grammys, but I feel so out of place."
01:53:03;01:53:06;"After we washed plates, they was always out of state."
01:53:06;01:53:08;"That is a sin."
01:53:08;01:53:10;"I will build to win."
01:53:10;01:53:12;"Came to take the title, rosé waving in the stands."
01:53:12;01:53:16;"Academics was a myth, I can always pleat the fifth."
01:53:16;01:53:19;"I'll give it to you live, Beethoven on the fifth."
01:53:19;01:53:22;"Your favorite films tank, Titanic sank."
01:53:22;01:53:24;"Aroma of the dank, as I'm breezing through the bank."
01:53:24;01:53:27;"Black market open, forbidden is from the poorest to the richest."
01:53:27;01:53:30;"From the poorest to the richest."
01:53:34;01:53:36;"Ricky Ross."
01:53:36;01:53:41;"That was Rick Ross with his remix of Adele's smash single, ""Hello."""
01:53:41;01:53:41;"Hello."
01:53:41;01:53:44;"And that's about it for Time Crisis 11 Thanksgiving edition."
01:53:44;01:53:45;"Oh man."
01:53:45;01:53:48;"Very blessed to have Desus and Mero back in the studio."
01:53:48;01:53:48;"Oh man."
01:53:48;01:53:49;"We are the ones that is blessed, my son."
01:53:49;01:53:51;"Thanks for allowing us back in here."
01:53:51;01:53:52;"Back in New York, I feel like Patrick Ewing."
01:53:52;01:53:53;"Yes."
01:53:53;01:53:54;"Shout out Makonnen."
01:53:54;01:53:55;"Shout out Alabasta Ewing."
01:53:55;01:53:58;"Shout out to Porzingis."
01:53:58;01:53:59;"We bang with you, my guy."
01:53:59;01:54:02;"I know you've seen us on the Snapchat bullying you and shit on the draft day,"
01:54:02;01:54:03;"but that's not really how we feel, my guy."
01:54:03;01:54:04;"Back on us, back on us."
01:54:04;01:54:05;"Rosé?"
01:54:05;01:54:06;"We're saying sorry like Justin Bieber."
01:54:06;01:54:07;"That's right."
01:54:07;01:54:08;"Big things popping for Porzingis."
01:54:08;01:54:09;"We should get him on the show sometime."
01:54:09;01:54:10;"Definitely."
01:54:10;01:54:13;"He said it today, his favorite artist is Future."
01:54:13;01:54:15;"He likes to listen to Future before Nick Games."
01:54:15;01:54:18;"Well, Despot and I made an appearance in a Future video."
01:54:18;01:54:18;"I saw that."
01:54:18;01:54:19;"Supposedly."
01:54:19;01:54:20;"You know what?"
01:54:20;01:54:22;"I was just like, yo, I was looking through it."
01:54:22;01:54:23;"I was like, let me see this video."
01:54:23;01:54:25;"I was like, is that Ezra?"
01:54:25;01:54:26;"That's right."
01:54:26;01:54:29;"I was like, I had to like, I put on glasses so I could take them off to look closer."
01:54:29;01:54:34;"Next show, Desus, Mero, Porzingis, Future."
01:54:34;01:54:35;"Oh, what a lineup."
01:54:35;01:54:36;"That's going to be crazy."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"That's good."
01:54:37;01:54:38;"That's also the next year's Coachella lineup."
01:54:38;01:54:40;"The main stage."
01:54:40;01:54:44;"Thanks again to Dave Maklovich from Chromio, who was here in the first hour."
01:54:44;01:54:46;"Lots of respect to him."
01:54:46;01:54:47;"All disrespect to Seinfeld 2000."
01:54:47;01:54:50;"He called in, he pretended to be Tim Cook."
01:54:50;01:54:51;"It was a nightmare."
01:54:51;01:54:55;"Thanks again to Despot and thank you for having come to my Thanksgiving"
01:54:55;01:54:56;"and breaking bread with my family."
01:54:56;01:54:57;"All right."
01:54:57;01:54:59;"Time Crisis 11 is over."
01:54:59;01:55:01;"We'll see you in two weeks."
01:55:01;01:55:02;"Bye."
01:55:02;01:55:02;"Bye."
01:55:03;01:55:07;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:55:07;01:55:14;"B-B-B-Beast War One."
