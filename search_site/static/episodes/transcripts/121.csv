00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis in a time of crisis. United by FaceTime to talk about the crisis."
00:08;00:15;"And this time we're joined by Hank Azaria who threw a lit match on the kerosene-soaked log"
00:15;00:22;"of Classic Rock Twitter. We also talked Red Lobster and we finally get to a few of those"
00:22;00:30;"Father of the Bride emails. This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:34;00:40;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:40;00:46;"You were a felt rubbing me, all my rightful chances."
00:46;00:53;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:53;01:00;"And so I dealt you the blow, when a bus had to go."
01:01;01:06;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:06;01:12;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:12;01:16;"Keep an only man."
01:16;01:19;"Time Crisis back once again. What's up Jake?"
01:19;01:20;"Not much, how are you?"
01:20;01:26;"I'm chilling. Business as usual. Just letting the days go by."
01:30;01:34;"Yeah, I hear you man. You know, it is what it is."
01:34;01:41;"Just real quick, I got kind of a lesson in various COVID theories from my auto mechanic today."
01:41;01:43;"Oh really?"
01:43;01:48;"That was my big sort of event of the day. I had to get my car worked on a little bit and then"
01:48;01:51;"I was writing a check to the mechanic in his office."
01:51;01:58;"Writing a check? That's not the most COVID-friendly way of exchanging money."
01:58;02:00;"That's what he likes and he likes them written out to cash."
02:00;02:05;"So that way he can just cash the check and not have to declare the income."
02:05;02:08;"But I'm sitting there writing a check, wearing a mask and he's like,"
02:08;02:09;"""This whole thing's overblown."""
02:09;02:13;"He went off for 10 minutes about the virus is from a lab theory."
02:13;02:14;"Oh right, sure."
02:14;02:21;"Developed in a lab in Wuhan and leaked that doctors are forging death certificates to"
02:21;02:24;"attribute deaths that were not COVID related to COVID,"
02:24;02:27;"to increase the numbers, to increase federal funding."
02:27;02:29;"I mean, he was just going down a rabbit hole."
02:29;02:33;"Did you try to steer the conversation over to JFK conspiracy theories?"
02:33;02:36;"I'm going to save that for next time. I would love to get his take."
02:36;02:37;"I mean, he just kind of went off and I was just like..."
02:37;02:38;"What's his name?"
02:38;02:40;"His name is Max."
02:40;02:43;"Max, you seem like a guy who doesn't always buy the official narrative."
02:43;02:46;"Check out that new 17-minute Bob Dylan song."
02:46;02:54;"It's funny, the conspiracy theory community can never fully become a true voting block"
02:54;02:56;"or political force because everybody has their own one."
02:57;03:02;"I feel like with Max, if I had brought up an even more outlandish conspiracy theory,"
03:02;03:04;"he would have just been there right with me."
03:04;03:06;"He would have just been like, ""Oh, absolutely."""
03:06;03:10;"I was sort of like listening and then was just sort of like,"
03:10;03:12;"""Well, it is pretty serious though. It is real."""
03:12;03:15;"Like people in New York are really getting hit hard."
03:15;03:17;"And he was sort of like, ""Oh yeah, no, you're right."""
03:17;03:17;"Right."
03:17;03:18;"I'm not saying it's not real."
03:18;03:20;"I'm just saying it's not really as bad as they're saying it is."
03:20;03:25;"I'm just thinking about the dumbest conspiracy theories you could have pivoted to."
03:25;03:28;"Somebody's like, ""It was created by the Wuhan lab."
03:28;03:30;"That's it's bioterrorism and the Dr. Forge conspiracy."""
03:30;03:32;"And you're like, ""I feel you, Max."""
03:32;03:36;"By the way, you know, Paul McCartney died in 1968."
03:36;03:38;"That's not him on Abbey Road."
03:38;03:39;"He was dead."
03:39;03:40;"That's a full imposter."
03:40;03:44;"Jake, I've been saying this for my entire 53 years on this planet."
03:44;03:46;"I've been saying that."
03:46;03:46;"Paul is dead."
03:46;03:52;"And that's why on the cover of Abbey Road, he's not wearing shoes because he's the corpse."
03:52;03:55;"George Harrison is the gravedigger."
03:55;03:56;"Are you familiar with that theory?"
03:56;03:58;"Yes."
03:58;04:03;"I feel like that one, nobody's ever given a single good reason why."
04:03;04:06;"It's like the Beatles just put their heads together and they were just kind of like,"
04:06;04:07;"""You know what?"
04:07;04:11;"We need another 18 months of the original lineup."""
04:11;04:11;"Right."
04:11;04:12;"And Paul's dead, man."
04:12;04:14;"We got at least two more albums to record."
04:14;04:16;"So, you know, let's figure this out."
04:16;04:18;"Let's find somebody who looks like him."
04:19;04:23;"Here come old Flat Top, he come grooving up slowly."
04:23;04:29;"He got juju eyeball, he one holy roller."
04:29;04:34;"He got hair down to his knee."
04:34;04:40;"Got to be a joker, he just do what he please."
04:40;04:43;"What was the scene like at the garage?"
04:43;04:47;"Everybody keeping a respectful distance, lots of masks, gloves."
04:48;04:54;"I was the only one there, Max and his one employee, and they were going no mask, no mask, no glove."
04:54;04:58;"The mask thing, it's like it's the easiest thing for everybody to do, just throw a mask on."
04:58;05:02;"His garage is like a few blocks from my house, so I go by it every day."
05:02;05:06;"And I've seen him out in his parking lot wearing a mask most days."
05:06;05:10;"And I said, I was like, ""Max, you sound so skeptical,"
05:10;05:12;"but I drive by here every day, I see you wearing a mask."""
05:12;05:15;"And he's like, ""Well, of course, I want to make my customers feel comfortable."
05:15;05:17;"I want to make you feel comfortable."""
05:17;05:19;"That said, this is way overblown."
05:19;05:21;"I appreciate that."
05:21;05:24;"He's basically saying, I may have my eyes open to the truth,"
05:24;05:26;"but I still want the sheeple to feel comfortable."
05:26;05:29;"I'm not trying to scare the sheeple."
05:29;05:29;"Yeah."
05:29;05:33;"You know, speaking of COVID and the unraveling of American society"
05:33;05:38;"and the differing viewpoints, that type of exchange, you guys had a pretty mellow one,"
05:38;05:44;"but clearly we're seeing all over the country, people with differing views on the severity of"
05:44;05:48;"COVID and what the government should be doing are really starting to clash."
05:48;05:55;"On our text chain, we were sharing a video down in Florida of a group of protesters who got posted"
05:55;06:00;"up outside of a gym that obviously was not open, and they were protesting and agitating for the"
06:00;06:02;"gym to reopen."
06:02;06:08;"And they got right down on the sidewalk and started doing pushups, jumping jacks, and sit-ups"
06:08;06:11;"as a kind of, I don't know, show of force, I guess."
06:12;06:16;"Why should we have to do these pushups outside the gym?"
06:16;06:18;"We should be allowed to do them inside the gym."
06:18;06:22;"But also, one that went viral recently, this is actually very unique."
06:22;06:25;"This is some of the most cutting edge reporting that TC has ever done."
06:25;06:30;"Very recently, this past week, Red Lobster started trending on Twitter"
06:30;06:35;"because it was another one of these tense COVID interactions."
06:35;06:39;"And the video is from Mother's Day, but it really went viral this past week."
06:39;06:46;"And essentially, from what I saw in the video, you see two women, one Red Lobster employee,"
06:46;06:51;"one a civilian, burst out of the front doors of the Red Lobster in a kind of scuffle."
06:51;06:56;"And you kind of understand that this one woman was really pissed off, and the employee was like,"
06:56;06:58;"felt very disrespected."
06:58;07:00;"And they're basically kind of hitting each other."
07:00;07:02;"You actually see the woman hit the employee first."
07:02;07:06;"Then the employee grabs her hair, and they're going at it."
07:06;07:09;"And at some point, one of the bystanders says something like,"
07:09;07:11;"""Well, how do you think we're supposed to feel"
07:11;07:14;"when we've been waiting three hours for our Red Lobster?"""
07:14;07:20;"Obviously, I think this went so viral because people were like, ""How entitled can you get?"
07:20;07:23;"It's a Mother's Day. Just go home. Make some pancakes."
07:23;07:25;"Come on, just chill out."
07:25;07:29;"Call back. Daddy making pancakes."
07:29;07:32;"If there's any day that Daddy should be making pancakes, it's Mother's Day."""
07:32;07:33;"Boom."
07:33;07:40;"But anyway, it got me thinking. We've talked very, very little about Red Lobster on this show."
07:40;07:43;"In fact, Seinfeld, I don't know if you have this accessible."
07:43;07:45;"You might have to check out the TCU Wiki."
07:45;07:48;"Have we ever talked about Red Lobster on Time Crisis?"
07:48;07:50;"Off the top of my head, we have not."
07:50;07:54;"But as you guys conversate, I'll look into it a little bit further."
07:54;07:57;"Keep hacking away."
07:57;07:58;"And what episode is this?"
07:58;08:01;"It's episode 121."
08:01;08:06;"That's crazy. 242 hours of content and maybe no Red Lobster."
08:06;08:10;"So anyway, rather than dwell over this specific confrontation,"
08:10;08:15;"which seems like a pretty, to me, clear-cut case of a person with a very bad attitude"
08:15;08:19;"disrespecting service workers, I think that's pretty cut and dry."
08:19;08:24;"And actually, in this case, Red Lobster, the employees really seem like the heroes."
08:24;08:28;"So I thought we'd do an old school TC dive with Jake doing the research."
08:28;08:32;"So Jake, you did a little bit of your own number crunching before the show."
08:32;08:33;"I sure did."
08:33;08:37;"Corporate food history."
08:37;08:39;"Let's talk about it."
08:39;08:43;"So I'm very excited about this, Jake."
08:43;08:44;"What have you turned up?"
08:44;08:46;"All right. Well, I'll just start from the beginning."
08:46;08:49;"I mean, Red Lobster founded 1968."
08:49;08:51;"Very tumultuous year."
08:51;08:52;"Yes."
08:52;08:57;"1968 is famously like this, a year where everything changed."
08:57;08:58;"You have global protests."
08:58;09:02;"You got infamously the confrontation between police and protesters"
09:02;09:06;"at the Democratic National Convention."
09:06;09:07;"Vietnam popping."
09:07;09:08;"I mean, truly crazy times."
09:08;09:10;"Yet another signpost in history."
09:10;09:13;"And I also feel like, just off the top of my head,"
09:13;09:17;"because you've always kind of studied the American retail landscape,"
09:17;09:22;"whenever I see a store that says, ""Since 1975,"""
09:22;09:25;"maybe because I'm coming from New York, where New York was all f***ed up in the '70s."
09:25;09:31;"When I see a store that's like, ""Since 1975,"" like a restaurant, I'm always like, ""Random."""
09:31;09:33;"Because I just feel like with the recession and stuff,"
09:33;09:36;"it must have been a dip in terms of new businesses opening."
09:36;09:37;"It was probably hard to stay in business."
09:37;09:39;"So I feel like I see certain years,"
09:39;09:42;"and they always strike me as like, ""Huh, that's when that opened?"""
09:42;09:45;"And I feel like from all my years knowing you,"
09:45;09:50;"and you having a lot of these origin stories at the tips of your fingers,"
09:50;09:54;"I feel like a lot of these classic places opened more in the early '60s or '50s."
09:54;09:58;"Is there anything to that? Is '68 kind of a bit of an outlier?"
09:58;10:01;"It's true. A lot of the classic fast food restaurants,"
10:01;10:03;"McDonald's, Burger King, that sort of thing,"
10:03;10:07;"opened in the late '50s, early '60s."
10:07;10:10;"For instance, '62 is a real red-letter date."
10:10;10:15;"That's like, you got Taco Bell, you got Walmart, you got one other."
10:15;10:19;"And Burger King was late '50s, McDonald's was actually late '40s."
10:19;10:20;"So it's true."
10:20;10:25;"But it kind of makes sense that the origins of the casual dining industry"
10:25;10:26;"would be a little bit later."
10:26;10:31;"Right. And I feel like TGI Friday is also maybe late '60s, early '70s."
10:31;10:33;"I think that's mid '60s in New York City."
10:33;10:35;"Okay. Mid."
10:35;10:38;"But yeah, it's like once the fast food industry is entrenched,"
10:38;10:42;"it makes sense that there'd be another sector of the restaurant industry"
10:42;10:46;"that was ready to sort of mature or begin maturing."
10:46;10:50;"And also, I gotta say I'm a little bit surprised that it's Florida."
10:50;10:53;"Obviously, Florida, a lot of beautiful coastline,"
10:53;10:56;"beachfront properties, and of course, seafood."
10:56;10:59;"I guess there's something about Red Lobster that always seemed like"
10:59;11:02;"they were going more for like a New England thing."
11:02;11:05;"I mean, even if you told me North Carolina, I might've bought it."
11:05;11:05;"But you know what I mean?"
11:05;11:08;"Well, right. Lobster is a classic New England dish."
11:08;11:11;"Now, it's funny that you mentioned the Florida coastline"
11:11;11:14;"because he opened it in Lakeland, Florida,"
11:14;11:17;"because he wanted to see, the founder,"
11:17;11:22;"wanted to see how a seafood restaurant would fare in a non-coastal region."
11:22;11:25;"And Lakeland, Florida, is the innermost city in Florida."
11:25;11:26;"Whoa."
11:26;11:29;"Yeah. Now, I should say who started the restaurant,"
11:29;11:33;"because this is probably a name that will stir something within you."
11:33;11:34;"Bill Darden."
11:34;11:39;"Does the name Bill Darden mean anything to you?"
11:39;11:43;"I mean, the first thing that I'm guessing, was he the Pepsi executive?"
11:43;11:43;"Nope."
11:43;11:45;"Has he come up on Time Crisis before?"
11:45;11:50;"The company that was eventually named after him certainly has Darden Restaurant Group."
11:50;11:53;"Darden, that's where Hannah invested."
11:53;11:56;"Yep. Parent company to Olive Garden, but we will get to that."
11:56;11:57;"I don't want to jump too far ahead."
11:57;11:58;"Okay."
11:58;12:02;"So, Bill Darden, this is another classic, like,"
12:02;12:06;"madman, sort of like 20th century American story."
12:06;12:12;"Born in 1919 in Georgia, starts his first restaurant called the Green Frog,"
12:12;12:16;"which was a Depression-era lunch counter in 1938."
12:16;12:17;"Whoa."
12:17;12:23;"And so, by the time 1968 comes around, he's 49, and he starts Red Lobster."
12:23;12:27;"So, it's a huge success off the bat, the first location."
12:27;12:30;"He and his business partner opened four more very quickly."
12:30;12:35;"And then in 1970, the General Mills Corporation acquires the whole company."
12:35;12:39;"And under that agreement, Bill Darden is hired to run all the restaurants"
12:39;12:44;"and establish a General Mills restaurant division in Orlando, Florida."
12:44;12:48;"This is interesting because when one company buys another company,"
12:48;12:53;"they're not just buying the physical assets, they're also buying the talent."
12:53;12:55;"And I was thinking about this."
12:55;12:59;"I recently read Bob Iger's book where he's talking about his tenure at Disney."
12:59;13:01;"He originally worked at ABC."
13:01;13:02;"Disney bought ABC."
13:02;13:08;"So, now he's actually this other group, Capital Cities, bought ABC, and then Disney bought them."
13:08;13:11;"So, suddenly, he's a Disney employee after decades at ABC."
13:11;13:17;"And then eventually, he takes over Disney, and he buys Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm,"
13:17;13:19;"creating the Disney that we know today."
13:19;13:21;"His book is kind of geared towards--"
13:21;13:25;"it's a memoir, but it's also kind of just like advice about leadership and stuff."
13:25;13:26;"And he's very clear about that."
13:26;13:30;"When you're buying a company, you're also buying the talent."
13:30;13:32;"And that's why it can't be like a hostile takeover."
13:32;13:35;"It's got to be kind vibe because you've got to nurture that talent."
13:35;13:39;"And I can imagine the same things going through their head where General Mills is saying,"
13:39;13:42;"""We want to buy Red Lobster, but you know what?"
13:42;13:47;"We don't want to just plunk down this cash and watch this creative guy, Bill Darden,"
13:47;13:49;"go f*** off to an island somewhere."
13:49;13:54;"We're also paying to bring in Bill Darden because we just don't need five empty restaurants."
13:54;13:55;"We need the genius of Bill Darden."""
13:55;13:56;"Yeah."
13:56;14:01;"I mean, we were talking about those fast food restaurants earlier,"
14:01;14:05;"the McDonald's and the Burger King started 10 years prior to all this."
14:05;14:10;"And we've talked about some of those guys, the Glenn Bells, the Carl Karchers,"
14:10;14:13;"the guys that were the founders of the fast food restaurant."
14:13;14:16;"I really do feel like Bill Darden is sort of an unsung hero."
14:16;14:18;"He really is the father of casual dining."
14:18;14:21;"Not only did he start Red Lobster, but he took over the--"
14:21;14:25;"First of all, I had no idea that General Mills was in the restaurant business."
14:25;14:27;"I mean, I'm thinking General Mills cereal, right?"
14:27;14:28;"Exactly."
14:28;14:29;"Yeah."
14:29;14:32;"So yeah, I mean, they have a vision of like starting a restaurant division."
14:32;14:35;"They put Bill Darden in charge."
14:35;14:40;"Red Lobster continues to expand rapidly under General Mills' stewardship."
14:40;14:46;"And they start experimenting with various full service family restaurant chains throughout the"
14:46;14:46;"70s."
14:46;14:51;"One that was sort of successful was called the York Steakhouse, which was a chain of"
14:51;14:57;"English-themed steak and chop restaurants, which was like steak and potatoes."
14:58;15:03;"I could picture it, like a wood paneled fake English tavern in the 70s,"
15:03;15:06;"eating like overcooked steak and like a baked potato."
15:06;15:07;"Absolutely."
15:07;15:14;"That didn't last all that long, but they struck gold in '82 when Darden starts the Olive Garden."
15:14;15:15;"Oh, crazy."
15:15;15:20;"And so yeah, the 80s, like Red Lobster and Olive Garden are like the main flagships of"
15:20;15:23;"the General Mills restaurant portfolio."
15:23;15:28;"And then in '94, Bill Darden dies at age 75."
15:28;15:35;"I was reading his obituary in the Orlando Sentinel today from 1994."
15:35;15:37;"It sounded like a gem of a guy."
15:37;15:41;"He's like one of those guys that would just like kind of knew everyone's kids' names,"
15:41;15:46;"you know, like people that like he would interact with only rarely, but would sort of like Bill"
15:46;15:49;"Clinton style would just remember everything about everyone."
15:50;15:57;"So anyway, '95, General Mills, for reasons I'm assuming are unrelated to Bill Darden's death,"
15:57;16:00;"they decide to get out of, or maybe it was related, I don't know."
16:00;16:06;"They decide to get out of the restaurant industry and they decide to spin off all of the restaurants"
16:06;16:11;"and start a new company named after Bill Darden called the Darden Restaurant Group."
16:11;16:13;"And like Darden still is like kind of going strong today."
16:13;16:17;"They are the largest full service restaurant company in the world."
16:17;16:23;"And Olive Garden is still by far their biggest sort of flagship restaurant in their portfolio."
16:23;16:25;"Red Lobster a close second."
16:25;16:26;"Weird irony."
16:26;16:29;"Darden no longer owns Red Lobster."
16:29;16:30;"Oh, damn."
16:30;16:35;"So the restaurant that Bill Darden started that ended up leading to the company that"
16:35;16:38;"was named after him no longer owns Red Lobster."
16:58;17:16;"It's a trip."
17:16;17:20;"It's got a funky beat and I can bug out to it."
17:20;17:22;"How did they lose the jewel in the crown, man?"
17:22;17:30;"Okay, so in December of 2013, Darden Restaurant Group announces the plans to sell off Red Lobster,"
17:30;17:32;"citing pressure from stock investors."
17:32;17:39;"Apparently, this was in direct response to Red Lobster spending $100 million on a new"
17:39;17:44;"digital platform, which was a year behind schedule and way over budget."
17:44;17:48;"Now, there was no source cited on that on the Wikipedia page."
17:48;17:53;"And I googled my little heart out trying to find an article about this aborted Red Lobster"
17:53;17:55;"digital platform and I couldn't find anything."
17:55;17:58;"So it could be weird like Wikipedia hearsay."
17:58;17:59;"Right."
17:59;18:01;"$100 million."
18:01;18:04;"What could the Red Lobster digital platform have been?"
18:04;18:09;"Like, I would imagine that there's some pretty basic ass tech that a big company,"
18:09;18:13;"you know, even if it's expensive, the same way that like a big company might,"
18:13;18:17;"you know, pay Adobe a fat check every year because the whole company needs"
18:17;18:19;"the Adobe suite or whatever."
18:19;18:24;"You would think there'd be something like that to handle orders for Red Lobster."
18:24;18:27;"But I don't know, maybe it goes a little deeper."
18:27;18:30;"Or maybe they're trying to build something even bigger, like a social network."
18:30;18:33;"Maybe it was super ambitious."
18:33;18:34;"A gaming platform."
18:34;18:36;"So I found a little bit about it."
18:36;18:37;"Really?"
18:37;18:39;"I mean, really, it's not as funny or as exciting."
18:39;18:46;"Yeah, I think that it's them trying to create sort of their own proprietary"
18:46;18:50;"rewards and reservations app."
18:50;18:54;"It cost $100 million."
18:54;18:59;"It's just sort of misguided more than, you know, like when you have DoorDash and"
18:59;19:03;"Resy and all these things, it just feels like it's something that all of these,"
19:03;19:07;"every company, it's so hubristic, but you are going,"
19:07;19:12;"""Oh, yeah, if I'm going to get into this, I'm going to have a team sort of dedicated"
19:12;19:13;"to making our own version."""
19:13;19:18;"Well, and also it's the type of thing where it seems a little crazy, but also,"
19:18;19:21;"I don't know, maybe they had like a baller CEO."
19:21;19:23;"Because, you know, there's these other stories where people always say,"
19:23;19:27;"""Why was Blockbuster so sh*tty to Netflix?"""
19:27;19:29;"There's like a famous story."
19:29;19:30;"I don't think we ever talked about it on the show."
19:30;19:35;"There's like a great article somewhere that's kind of about when Reed Hastings,"
19:35;19:38;"the CEO of Netflix and like the kind of Netflix crew, early, early days,"
19:38;19:43;"rolled out to basically try to sell themselves to Blockbuster."
19:43;19:46;"And they're like all nervous and they flew out."
19:46;19:48;"I think in the article, it's even saying like, you know, obviously,"
19:48;19:53;"the big Netflix executives don't think twice now about, you know, flying private."
19:53;19:56;"But at the time, the only way they could get there in time was to fly a private plane."
19:56;19:57;"And like, they were so nervous."
19:57;20:00;"They're like, ""Oh my God, I don't know if we can afford this."""
20:00;20:04;"They kind of felt like everything we've been working for the past few years, this is it."
20:04;20:07;"If we can get Blockbuster to buy us, we made it."
20:07;20:11;"And Blockbuster essentially kind of like laughed in their face."
20:11;20:13;"And now people look back at that as this moment like,"
20:13;20:15;"""Blockbuster, you morons."
20:15;20:17;"However much it costs, you should have bought Netflix."
20:17;20:21;"What they were building then would have essentially saved your business,"
20:21;20:23;"but they didn't take the big swing."""
20:23;20:25;"So you could imagine somebody at Red Lobster being like,"
20:25;20:27;"""We're not going down like Blockbuster."
20:27;20:29;"We're going to invest big."""
20:29;20:32;"And in fact, I think we've mentioned it on the show before."
20:32;20:36;"I know Chris Baio from Vampire Weekend follows the story closely."
20:36;20:37;"Shout out to Baio."
20:37;20:42;"That Domino's has really been surging in the pizza business the past few years"
20:42;20:47;"because Domino's did invest very heavily in proprietary technology"
20:47;20:51;"for getting their deliveries quicker and kind of covering everything."
20:51;20:56;"And for all we know, Domino's is probably selling some of that tech to the NSA and s*** like that."
20:56;21:01;"But essentially, the CEO of Domino's has given speeches where he says,"
21:01;21:03;"""You know what? We're not in the pizza business. We're in the tech business."""
21:03;21:05;"So you could cut..."
21:05;21:09;"I guess we could cut Red Lobster a little slack for being like,"
21:09;21:10;"""We're betting big on this."
21:10;21:12;"We need to build this software ourselves."
21:12;21:13;"We need to make this happen."""
21:13;21:18;"And then you got these conservative members of the board or investors who are just like..."
21:18;21:23;"To go back to Bob Iger, this is very classic that sometimes a CEO comes in"
21:23;21:27;"and they want to swing big because they know the ins and outs of the company"
21:27;21:30;"and they see that they're going the wrong way on the highway."
21:30;21:32;"And there's a truck coming and they can see it."
21:32;21:35;"And they know we got to bet big and shift course."
21:35;21:40;"And then sometimes you get the kind of members of the board or the investors who say, ""Not so fast."""
21:40;21:45;"For all we know, maybe Red Lobster just needed one more year to get that platform right"
21:45;21:47;"and they'd be back on top."
21:47;21:50;"Investors were not having it and they sold it off."
21:50;21:51;"They weren't having it."
21:51;21:51;"Tragic."
21:51;21:52;"Huge layoffs."
21:52;21:53;"Sold off by darn..."
21:53;21:57;"Purchased by Golden Gate Capital, which was one of these hedge funds"
21:58;22:03;"started by people from Bain Capital, purchased for $2.1 billion,"
22:03;22:06;"which seems low considering they spent $100 million on the digital platform."
22:06;22:11;"Incidentally, Golden Gate also owns California Pizza Kitchen."
22:11;22:14;"So that's a little bit of the end of the Red Lobster story."
22:14;22:16;"But if you're down, I'd love to keep going into the Darden story"
22:16;22:18;"because it kind of keeps going from there."
22:18;22:19;"Sure."
22:19;22:21;"So Darden the man is dead in your timeline."
22:21;22:23;"We're talking about Darden the company."
22:23;22:24;"Bill Darden died in '94."
22:24;22:28;"And I know your family unit is heavily invested in Darden."
22:28;22:33;"Although, was the end of the story, we found out that Hannah was divested from Darden?"
22:33;22:34;"Yes."
22:34;22:38;"Hannah divested from Darden a good 10, 15 years ago."
22:38;22:38;"Okay."
22:38;22:41;"So for people who don't remember, Jake's wife, Hannah,"
22:41;22:46;"she did some investments in companies she believed in as a young adult."
22:46;22:49;"And one of them was Darden because she was a fan of Olive Garden."
22:49;22:54;"But unfortunately, she sold off most of her stock."
22:54;22:58;"I think we looked it up, but it would have accrued a lot of value in the last 10 or 15 years."
22:58;23:01;"Well, I'm sure the stock's in the toilet right now."
23:01;23:01;"So anybody..."
23:01;23:09;"I feel like we're heading towards the one very problematic and untapped place for TC to go."
23:09;23:14;"We've done Sports Talk, Tree Talk, obviously music, obviously corporate food history."
23:14;23:17;"Finance, just straight up CNBC, investment."
23:17;23:19;"No idea what we're talking about."
23:19;23:21;"Just like, just full Jim Cramer."
23:21;23:23;"Folks, Darden stock's in the toilet."
23:23;23:24;"But here's the thing."
23:24;23:29;"I believe, or I guess whoever owns it now, Golden Gate, these guys are hurting."
23:29;23:31;"But I'll tell you one thing, man."
23:31;23:34;"I believe that once COVID is over, the Olive Gardens of the world,"
23:34;23:36;"the Red Lobsters, the California Pizza Kitchens,"
23:36;23:39;"they're coming back with a vengeance, folks."
23:39;23:40;"These are durable."
23:40;23:42;"These are good, all-American companies."
23:42;23:43;"The fundamentals are strong."
23:43;23:45;"Everybody's scared right now."
23:45;23:48;"But I'm telling you, now is the time to buy."
23:48;23:50;"Have you heard of the term activist investor?"
23:50;23:51;"Right."
23:51;23:51;"Yeah."
23:51;23:52;"Well, those are who we're talking about, right?"
23:52;23:56;"Activist investors are the type who are like, get really pissed off"
23:56;23:58;"and sometimes try to oust the CEO or something."
23:58;23:58;"Yes."
23:58;24:00;"When they don't like the way a company is being run."
24:00;24:06;"So a year after the Red Lobster digital platform debacle, Darden is hurting."
24:06;24:08;"Sales are down, the stock's in the toilet."
24:08;24:13;"And this guy, Jeff Smith, who runs a company called Starbird Value,"
24:13;24:17;"which is a big hedge fund, they owned less than 10% of the Darden restaurant group."
24:18;24:22;"He comes in to the Darden board meeting in September of 2014"
24:22;24:28;"and launches into this devastating 300-page PowerPoint"
24:28;24:30;"and just goes beast mode on the board,"
24:30;24:36;"convincing the board of Darden to oust all current management and replace the board,"
24:36;24:40;"or sorry, replace all the management with people from his company, Starbird."
24:40;24:45;"And I Googled this today, and there was like a ton of articles from September of 2014"
24:45;24:50;"in all of the financial websites about this coup that happened."
24:50;24:53;"And it was at the time seen as sort of like"
24:53;24:57;"the largest takeover of a company by an activist investor."
24:57;25:02;"Like it was the largest company to get sort of taken over by an activist investor."
25:02;25:02;"Wow."
25:02;25:06;"And I did pull one page from his 300-page PowerPoint,"
25:06;25:11;"which I just love to read some of this."
25:11;25:11;"I love it."
25:11;25:14;"Jake has a primary source document."
25:14;25:14;"Yes."
25:15;25:21;"So the focus of Jeff Smith's ire in this September 2014 presentation to the Darden board"
25:21;25:24;"was Olive Garden, which was the flagship."
25:24;25:28;"And so there's one page was called Breadsticks, just one example."
25:28;25:29;"(laughing)"
25:29;25:34;"It's called Breadsticks, just one example of food waste."
25:34;25:39;"As just one example, we believe lapsed discipline around Darden's renowned"
25:39;25:44;"unlimited salad and breadsticks offerings has led to both high food waste and a worse experience."
25:45;25:46;"And then he has like a chart."
25:46;25:52;"10 years ago, the practice was servers placed one breadstick per guest,"
25:52;25:54;"plus one breadstick for the table."
25:54;25:57;"For example, if you had four guests, five breadsticks were served."
25:57;26:02;"Impact, if guests wanted more breadsticks, fresh ones were served hot,"
26:02;26:05;"enhancing the guest experience with many server touch points."
26:05;26:10;"This method minimized food waste and focused on the guest experience."
26:10;26:12;"With fewer breadsticks on the table,"
26:12;26:16;"guests inherently consumed less and ordered more appetizers and desserts,"
26:16;26:21;"improving margins, profitability, and improving the guest experience."
26:21;26:28;"Now his analysis on the other side of the chart was Olive Garden today, 2014."
26:28;26:34;"The same rule exists as 10 years ago, but restaurants lack training and discipline to deliver."
26:34;26:38;"Now servers will routinely bring an excess of breadsticks,"
26:38;26:40;"significantly outnumbering the number of guests."
26:41;26:45;"Most customers will not eat all the breadsticks, creating an enormous amount of waste."
26:45;26:48;"Breadsticks get cold as they sit on the table."
26:48;26:52;"Darden management readily admits that after sitting for just seven minutes,"
26:52;26:54;"the breadsticks deteriorate in quality."
26:54;26:59;"Servers will not return to the table as often, detracting from a customer experience."
26:59;27:07;"So it was 300 pages of like granular analysis of how the performance of Olive Garden restaurants"
27:07;27:11;"had gone down the tubes and that why he needed to step in with his people."
27:11;27:13;"Wait, so he was talking specifically about Olive Garden?"
27:13;27:17;"Because Olive Garden famously has the unlimited breadsticks?"
27:17;27:22;"Yes, I mean, there were other restaurants he did talk about in the presentation,"
27:22;27:24;"but the bulk of it was focused on Olive Garden."
27:24;27:25;"And so he took over."
27:25;27:26;"Wow."
27:26;27:27;"He ran that for two years."
27:27;27:30;"So then there was a lot of articles from like two years later,"
27:30;27:34;"2016, talking about how Darden stock had gone up 60%."
27:34;27:36;"Holy s***."
27:36;27:38;"Since Jeff Smith had taken it over."
27:38;27:43;"And after that, so a little postscript to that final chapter of the saga is,"
27:43;27:47;"remember when Papa John Schnatter was fired from the Papa John's board?"
27:47;27:49;"Oh yeah, very recently."
27:49;27:55;"And actually to tie it back, some people think that he either predicted or maybe in the case"
27:55;28:01;"of your friend Max, conspiracy theorists actually created COVID because he gave a famously,"
28:01;28:05;"seemingly unhinged interview at post being ousted."
28:05;28:08;"And he promised the world that a reckoning was coming."
28:08;28:12;"And at the time, this was like maybe six months ago or something,"
28:12;28:14;"you know, he's got that kind of devilish grin."
28:14;28:16;"He's got this really dark eyes."
28:16;28:20;"He made a reference that he ate like 40 pizzas in a week or something."
28:20;28:22;"And how a reckoning was coming."
28:22;28:28;"So you got the impression from Papa John that this was a man, he was consuming a lot,"
28:28;28:32;"but it didn't seem like he was giving that as an example of how he was"
28:32;28:35;"just kind of losing the plot and kind of not eating well."
28:35;28:40;"It almost seemed like this is a man who's storing energy for something big."
28:40;28:41;"This is a man in training."
28:41;28:43;"This is a man with a plan."
28:43;28:47;"This is a man who sees what's happening and he sees the puzzle coming together."
28:47;28:49;"Some kind of, it's almost like a Da Vinci code type thing."
28:49;28:54;"He's this kind of like villain and he's promised a reckoning is coming."
28:54;28:59;"And when COVID first hit, a lot of kind of eagle-eyed internet sleuths said,"
28:59;29:00;"""Wait a second."
29:00;29:02;"Is this the reckoning that Papa John promised?"""
29:02;29:04;"So anyway, very controversial guy."
29:04;29:08;"But so yeah, he was ousted from the board, I believe, because he said the N-word, right?"
29:08;29:11;"Wasn't that the give stated reason?"
29:11;29:12;"Correct."
29:12;29:14;"That was in 2018."
29:14;29:18;"And then so Papa John's was a little bit rudderless there for a while."
29:18;29:23;"They took a look at Jeff Smith's success with Olive Garden and the Darden Restaurant Group."
29:23;29:26;"And they reached out, instead of it being like a takeover,"
29:26;29:30;"they reached out to Jeff Smith and was like, ""Can you please come be our chairman?"""
29:30;29:31;"Whoa."
29:31;29:33;"Which he did for six months."
29:33;29:39;"And then he handed the reins over to a former Arby's top dog to become Papa's CEO."
29:39;29:45;"I bet the first thing Jeff Smith said before he accepted the Papa John's gig was,"
29:45;29:47;"""Send over the breadsticks data."
29:47;29:50;"I'll take a look at it and then I'll decide."""
29:50;29:54;"Jeff Smith was like, ""I need to spend about a week researching the garlic sauce"
29:54;29:57;"giveaway with Papa John's."
29:57;30:01;"I know you guys also give away the marinara sauce cups, as well as the nacho cheese cups."
30:01;30:05;"But I really want to nail down this garlic sauce situation."""
30:05;30:06;"It's out of control."
30:36;30:52;"You know, one question that I had, speaking of breadsticks,"
30:52;30:57;"now the equivalent of a breadstick at Red Lobster, I believe, is a Cheddar Bay Biscuit."
30:57;30:58;"Is that correct, Jake?"
30:58;31:01;"In your research, did you find anything about the Cheddar Bay Biscuit?"
31:01;31:02;"Is that a giveaway at Red Lobster?"
31:02;31:05;"I've actually never been to a Red Lobster."
31:05;31:07;"I think I went to one many years ago."
31:07;31:09;"I mean, they advertise so heavily."
31:09;31:12;"You know how some people joke it's like always Toyotathon?"
31:12;31:14;"I thought it was always Lobster Fest."
31:14;31:14;"Yeah."
31:14;31:16;"Endless Lobster Fest promotions."
31:16;31:17;"But..."
31:17;31:18;"I don't know if those are free."
31:19;31:24;"No, well, maybe they're not free, but it's their, you know, it's their carbohydrate side."
31:24;31:26;"And it's Cheddar Bay Biscuits."
31:26;31:28;"People love the Cheddar Bay Biscuits."
31:28;31:31;"And I'm sure there's an obvious answer, but I was always kind of wondering,"
31:31;31:34;"is a Bay Biscuit a thing?"
31:34;31:36;"Or are they implying there's a place called Cheddar Bay?"
31:36;31:41;"You know, like you could imagine some like, somewhere in like Rhode Island,"
31:41;31:44;"a little New England nook called Cheddar Bay."
31:44;31:47;"But anyway, people are obsessed with Cheddar Bay Biscuits."
31:47;31:49;"I think you can even buy the mix and make it at home."
31:49;31:52;"It looks like Cheddar Bay is a fictitious location"
31:52;31:55;"to reflect the seaside atmosphere of Red Lobster restaurants."
31:55;31:56;"Perfect."
31:56;31:56;"Oh, wow."
31:56;32:01;"They were initially introduced as fresh-baked hot cheese garlic bread"
32:01;32:03;"and then rebranded as Cheddar Bay Biscuits."
32:03;32:07;"All these places, you know, from Einstein Brothers to Olive Garden,"
32:07;32:09;"they create these like phony histories."
32:09;32:12;"It's like Lake Wobbegon or something."
32:12;32:13;"Yeah."
32:13;32:16;"Things are a little simpler out in Cheddar Bay."
32:16;32:17;"It's very Las Vegas, right?"
32:17;32:19;"I mean, that's what people say."
32:19;32:20;"It's like the classic American city."
32:20;32:22;"Yeah."
32:22;32:26;"I mean, or Los Angeles too, where so much of the Spanish architecture"
32:26;32:33;"and even the Spanish street names was actually created and named by the Anglos."
32:33;32:33;"Right."
32:33;32:38;"Because they wanted to create a sense of like this old Spanish-Mexican history,"
32:38;32:40;"but they kind of had to build some of it from scratch."
32:40;32:42;"Cheddar Bay is not a real place."
32:42;32:44;"The Einstein Brothers don't exist."
32:45;32:48;"That's another good one to bring up with your mechanic"
32:48;32:50;"when he's going off on conspiracy theories and be like,"
32:50;32:53;"""You know, man, I've been doing some original research myself."
32:53;32:54;"You know Cheddar Bay Biscuits?"
32:54;32:56;"Oh, yeah. Red Lobster?"
32:56;32:58;"Get this, man. Cheddar Bay literally doesn't exist."
32:58;33:00;"Fully pulled out of thin air."""
33:00;33:01;"All right."
33:01;33:04;"Well, there's been a lot going on in the world today,"
33:04;33:05;"in the world this past week."
33:05;33:08;"From Red Lobster to what we got coming up next,"
33:08;33:10;"this might be the most..."
33:10;33:11;"Topical?"
33:11;33:12;"...up-to-date TC."
33:12;33:14;"The most topical TC ever."
33:15;33:16;"Also this past week on Twitter,"
33:16;33:19;"you had a lot of people talking about classic rock,"
33:19;33:22;"which, you know, always warms my heart to see."
33:22;33:22;"Oh, yeah."
33:22;33:25;"And you saw various names of bands trending."
33:25;33:29;"Bruce Springsteen, Aerosmith, things like that."
33:29;33:32;"During COVID, it's hard to tell why anything's trending."
33:32;33:34;"You see all sorts of random actors."
33:34;33:35;"You never know why anymore."
33:35;33:36;"Time has no meaning."
33:36;33:37;"Trends have no meaning."
33:37;33:42;"But in this case, it all started because of a simple question"
33:42;33:45;"posed by legendary actor Hank Azaria."
33:45;33:48;"And Hank asked a simple question,"
33:48;33:52;"which was, ""Fairly safe to say that the greatest rock band of all time discussion"
33:52;33:55;"is usually between the Stones, the Beatles, and Led Zepp."
33:55;33:58;"So what is the greatest American rock band of all time?"
33:58;34:00;"I know what I think."""
34:00;34:01;"And now you got everybody talking,"
34:01;34:03;"""Who is the greatest American rock band of all time?"""
34:03;34:05;"And then after all the responses, Hank said,"
34:05;34:06;"""Thank you for the many responses."
34:06;34:09;"I only saw what I consider the greatest mentioned once or twice."
34:09;34:11;"So I'm guessing I will not get agreement here."""
34:11;34:12;"The Doors!"
34:12;34:14;"Closely followed by Aerosmith."
34:14;34:16;"Interesting that he said The Doors,"
34:16;34:19;"and very interesting that people ride so hard for Aerosmith."
34:19;34:21;"Personally, we talked about this on our Text It."
34:21;34:24;"I think that producer Colin kind of made the best call,"
34:24;34:26;"even though it doesn't feel quite right."
34:26;34:27;"But he said, ""It's Metallica."""
34:27;34:30;"Metallica is kind of America's only long-running,"
34:30;34:33;"truly influential global rock band."
34:33;34:35;"Whether or not you like them, it's kind of..."
34:35;34:36;"It is what it is."
34:36;34:39;"But there is something funny when you really break it down."
34:40;34:45;"America doesn't produce the same types of rock bands."
34:45;34:48;"It's really strange, considering that rock is an American form."
34:48;34:52;"And obviously there's iconic American rock musicians."
34:52;34:54;"But when you get Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty,"
34:54;34:56;"these people had their bands,"
34:56;34:58;"but obviously they weren't built as a band."
34:58;35:02;"And then America just doesn't have a Stones or a Led Zepp."
35:02;35:04;"There's just no equivalent."
35:04;35:06;"We don't even have an AC/DC."
35:06;35:07;"Maybe Metallica's are AC/DC."
35:07;35:12;"But anyway, it was a real spicy question."
35:12;35:16;"And I think, ultimately, it raised more questions than it answered."
35:16;35:19;"But we're very lucky that Hank Azaria was down to get on the phone"
35:19;35:22;"and talk about what maybe was one of the biggest discussions"
35:22;35:25;"in the classic rock community all year."
35:25;35:28;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
35:28;35:33;"Hank, are you there?"
35:33;35:34;"I am here."
35:34;35:36;"Well, first of all, welcome to Time Crisis."
35:36;35:37;"How are you doing, man?"
35:37;35:38;"I'm all right."
35:38;35:40;"We really appreciate you coming through."
35:40;35:44;"I mean, you really created a firestorm on Twitter this past week."
35:44;35:45;"That was crazy."
35:45;35:46;"It was just yesterday morning."
35:46;35:50;"I was like, ""Well, I'm not used to my Twitter feed blowing up like that."""
35:50;35:51;"That was really weird."
35:51;35:53;"And it kept happening in waves and stuff."
35:53;35:57;"A simple question, but clearly people have some very strong feelings about it."
35:57;35:59;"What made this pop into your head?"
35:59;36:00;"Anything specific?"
36:00;36:03;"It's a question that I've asked a lot over the years."
36:03;36:05;"And I play a lot of poker, you know."
36:05;36:10;"And it's definitely a poker table favorite and sparks a good debate."
36:10;36:13;"Because everybody, you know, unless you think about it,"
36:13;36:16;"you don't realize that usually in terms of a classic rock band,"
36:16;36:18;"it's always a British band conversation."
36:18;36:23;"So the American band, you know, and it leads to what it led to on Twitter,"
36:23;36:24;"which is a lot of debate."
36:24;36:27;"There's something about the question too that it makes you realize"
36:27;36:30;"it's even though people can have their opinions,"
36:30;36:35;"clearly this country simply has not produced a consensus band"
36:35;36:36;"like the ones you mentioned in your tweet."
36:36;36:38;"You know, whoever you might think is the best,"
36:38;36:43;"we don't have a band that people mention in quite the same way as The Stones,"
36:43;36:44;"The Beatles, or Led Zepp."
36:44;36:46;"Obviously The Stones are in a very unique position"
36:46;36:49;"because they've been a band since the 60s."
36:49;36:51;"I don't think there is an equivalent."
36:51;36:53;"But so when you pose the question,"
36:53;36:56;"we're basing this off your final tweet,"
36:56;36:58;"you already in the back of your head were thinking The Doors."
36:58;37:01;"That's your poker table go-to when this comes up is The Doors?"
37:01;37:04;"Yeah, having thought about this for many years,"
37:04;37:05;"that's where I land."
37:05;37:08;"And of course, it's completely subjective and personal."
37:08;37:12;"But, you know, the only criteria I would say I really threw on there"
37:12;37:15;"is they got to have like a mega body of hits."
37:15;37:17;"Like you got to at least be able to say"
37:17;37:21;"there's at least like 10 or 12 songs that are classics,"
37:21;37:22;"which aren't too many bands."
37:22;37:24;"If you look at it in terms of that,"
37:24;37:25;"that I guess too is subjective."
37:25;37:29;"But they did change music, The Doors, you know."
37:29;37:30;"Absolutely."
37:30;37:31;"I happen to love The Doors."
37:31;37:32;"So, but yeah."
37:32;37:34;"You're an unabashed fan of The Doors."
37:34;37:35;"I am, yeah."
37:35;37:38;"One thing we've talked about on the show a lot is that"
37:38;37:41;"at some point in the late 90s, early 2000s,"
37:41;37:45;"a kind of ill wind started blowing around The Doors"
37:45;37:47;"and they became less fashionable."
37:47;37:48;"They were considered a very cool-"
37:48;37:50;"Explain that to me, like why was this Doors back?"
37:50;37:52;"What was The Doors backlash all about?"
37:52;37:54;"What's it based on?"
37:54;37:55;"It's hard to say."
37:55;37:56;"We've been curious about it."
37:56;37:57;"We never quite got into the bottom of it."
37:57;38:01;"I think on the one hand, Jim Morrison,"
38:01;38:04;"of all the 60s rock guys,"
38:04;38:07;"he started to be seen as the symbol of like pretension."
38:07;38:09;"I'm not saying I agree with it."
38:09;38:09;"I think it's unfair."
38:09;38:12;"But for whatever reason, he caught a lot of flack."
38:12;38:15;"Obviously he wasn't around to defend himself."
38:15;38:18;"You got David Crosby running his mouth about how,"
38:18;38:21;"you know, Jim Morrison was a loser for decades."
38:21;38:22;"You know, Crosby had his own run-ins with them."
38:22;38:23;"So we'll allow it."
38:23;38:25;"I mean, but even then there was like,"
38:26;38:28;"I feel like there's an early Radiohead song"
38:28;38:30;"that kind of like takes a dig at Jim Morrison."
38:30;38:34;"He just became the go-to guy to kind of make fun of."
38:34;38:36;"But when you first became a Doors fan,"
38:36;38:39;"was there anything provocative"
38:39;38:41;"or weird about being a Doors fan?"
38:41;38:43;"Or they were kind of understood to just be cool?"
38:43;38:46;"No, I mean, I'm 56 years old."
38:46;38:50;"So my Doors fandom flowered in college."
38:50;38:53;"So we're talking about 1980."
38:54;38:57;"And no, back then it was unequivocal."
38:57;38:59;"You know, he was just a rock god."
38:59;39:01;"And like nobody claims that Jim Morrison"
39:01;39:03;"was like a great individual."
39:03;39:06;"I mean, he was just a really talented songwriter."
39:06;39:10;"And he was a compelling rock god figure."
39:10;39:12;"He was really Dionysiac."
39:12;39:15;"And, but he was kind of a douche in many ways."
39:15;39:17;"There's no question about it."
39:17;39:19;"And that seems to be what some of his peers had to say."
39:19;39:23;"Although that could also be coming out of jealousy"
39:23;39:25;"or something like that."
39:25;39:28;"And maybe even the fact that he got the second wind"
39:28;39:30;"with the Val Kilmer's portrayal of him"
39:30;39:32;"in the early '90s movie."
39:32;39:35;"Maybe that gave him one last breath of relevance."
39:35;39:37;"And then it also put some other people off"
39:37;39:39;"'cause they were suddenly their opinion of Jim Morrison."
39:39;39:41;"The Doors is also based on their opinion of the film."
39:42;39:47;"♪ And blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles ♪"
39:47;39:51;"♪ Blood in the streets, it's up to my knees ♪"
39:51;39:55;"♪ Blood in the streets, the town of Chicago ♪"
39:55;40:00;"♪ Blood on the rise, it followed me ♪"
40:00;40:02;"♪ Yeah ♪"
40:02;40:17;"♪ Blood in the streets, on the river of sadness ♪"
40:17;40:21;"♪ Blood in the streets, it's up to my thighs ♪"

40:30;40:46;"- So early '80s, you're getting into The Doors,"
40:46;40:47;"who obviously weren't playing at the time,"
40:47;40:52;"but there was one '60s American rock band from California"
40:52;40:55;"that was selling out huge venues in the early '80s,"
40:55;40:56;"and that's The Grateful Dead."
40:56;40:57;"- Yeah."
40:57;40:59;"- Did they cross your mind, or were you just not a Deadhead?"
40:59;41:03;"- Well, I mean, I think a lot of people said The Dead"
41:03;41:06;"in response, and I certainly acknowledge it"
41:06;41:08;"as a valid entry."
41:08;41:10;"I just never got into The Dead."
41:10;41:13;"You know, my wife just recently admitted to me,"
41:13;41:14;"my wife is a Deadhead."
41:14;41:19;"She's seen like, I don't know, a lot of shows, okay?"
41:19;41:20;"She went around a lot."
41:20;41:23;"She admitted to me that she really was just fitting in"
41:23;41:25;"with her crowd."
41:25;41:26;"She never really loved them."
41:26;41:28;"She just kind of loved the experience"
41:28;41:31;"of going with people she loved to the shows,"
41:31;41:34;"but actually admitted that she never really loved The Dead."
41:34;41:36;"But that's not to say The Dead's not great, they are."
41:36;41:38;"- Right, and I'm sure it must have been"
41:38;41:42;"such a unique experience to be in their prime,"
41:42;41:44;"traveling with your friends to go to the shows."
41:44;41:47;"But so you found she's not playing a lot of Dead"
41:47;41:47;"around the house?"
41:47;41:49;"- No, no."
41:49;41:52;"And the truth, look, my musical taste got arrested"
41:52;41:58;"approximately 1992, maybe?"
41:58;42:00;"You know, I'm not a cutting edge music guy."
42:00;42:02;"I'm a definite classic rock guy."
42:02;42:06;"You know what weirds me out about classic rock?"
42:06;42:09;"You know, what you would, as defined by what you would,"
42:09;42:10;"like what you'd hear on a playlist"
42:10;42:11;"of like a classic rock station."
42:11;42:13;"It's done."
42:13;42:16;"It's like a defined, it's like the great American songbook"
42:16;42:19;"ended, like, you know, those, all those great old songs,"
42:19;42:21;"those old standards that Sinatra and them used to sing."
42:21;42:23;"Those are done."
42:23;42:24;"Like that just, that's it."
42:24;42:27;"And sort of the same with classic rock."
42:27;42:28;"It's like, that's it."
42:28;42:29;"It's finite now."
42:29;42:31;"- Yeah, it's not like there's new entries to the canon."
42:31;42:33;"And that's actually something else I wanted to ask you"
42:33;42:36;"because, so I'm picturing you, yeah,"
42:36;42:39;"you're a teenager, college age, early eighties."
42:39;42:44;"And there's one, another band that I saw pop up a few times"
42:44;42:47;"in people's responses, and that was Talking Heads,"
42:47;42:48;"who I love."
42:48;42:48;"- No, I love the Heads."
42:48;42:49;"- Great band."
42:49;42:49;"- Yeah, I love the Heads."
42:49;42:52;"- They were putting out albums right in that moment"
42:52;42:52;"you're talking about."
42:52;42:53;"So you were a fan at the time."
42:53;42:56;"You were listening to those albums as they came out."
42:56;42:57;"- Huge fan of the Heads."
42:57;43:00;"I mean, you know, back then, as much as I'm an old man now,"
43:00;43:03;"who, you know, in my day, son, we had classic rock."
43:03;43:08;"I mean, like every other kid, I knew every single band song."
43:08;43:10;"- Right, you were keeping up with everything."
43:10;43:12;"- Yeah, I was up on everything and it didn't occur to me"
43:12;43:13;"that anybody would."
43:13;43:16;"- But there is something where, when I saw people throw"
43:16;43:18;"out Talking Heads, a band that I love, now we know"
43:18;43:22;"you love them too, I just knew that, as much as you might try"
43:22;43:25;"to make the case that they're truly a great American band,"
43:25;43:28;"and they are, really an amazing catalog and, you know,"
43:28;43:29;"amazing live band."
43:29;43:31;"Anybody's seen Stop Making Sense knows that."
43:31;43:34;"For some reason, Talking Heads just don't easily slot"
43:34;43:36;"into this concept of classic rock."
43:36;43:37;"So you just like knew."
43:37;43:39;"I'm sure sitting around the poker table, people are like,"
43:39;43:40;"""Does America have a Led Zeppelin?"""
43:40;43:43;"So I would just be like, ""Yeah, Talking Heads."""
43:43;43:45;"It's just so different."
43:45;43:46;"It's a different tradition."
43:46;43:51;"- Yeah, by then, rock was not, it was getting pretty niche."
43:51;43:55;"And he's so, I mean, David Byrne, doing The Simpsons,"
43:55;43:57;"I've met a lot of these guys, 'cause they've come in"
43:57;43:58;"and recorded, you know?"
43:58;43:59;"- Yeah."
43:59;44:02;"- And you never know who you're gonna freak out"
44:02;44:02;"when you meet."
44:02;44:05;"I lost my mind meeting David Byrne almost more"
44:05;44:07;"than anybody else."
44:07;44:10;"I kind of freaked out when I met Mick Jagger too."
44:10;44:11;"But I thought, I knew I would."
44:11;44:14;"- Wait, 'cause did David Byrne do a voice on The Simpsons?"
44:14;44:15;"- He did."
44:15;44:17;"These guys all played themselves over the years."
44:17;44:20;"We had David Byrne and Tom Petty and Sting."
44:20;44:24;"And we've had almost every great rock and roller in."
44:24;44:26;"- I remember the Smashing Pumpkins episode."
44:26;44:27;"- Yeah."
44:27;44:28;"- 'Cause in the '90s, that's classic."
44:28;44:29;"- Yes."
44:29;44:33;"So we met all these guys and, you know, athletes"
44:33;44:37;"and musicians, I really kind of turned into a little kid"
44:37;44:37;"when I meet them."
44:37;44:40;"What's great about the Talking Heads, I mean,"
44:40;44:43;"is unbelievable, but I just don't know that they put out"
44:43;44:46;"enough to say they'd be like, they'd enter the pantheon"
44:46;44:49;"of all time, you know, I mean, they're definitely one"
44:49;44:50;"of the all time greatest bands, but like."
44:50;44:53;"- Well, they also just don't fit quite as comfortably"
44:53;44:57;"into like rock, 'cause they're like funk and new wave."
44:57;44:59;"It's just like a different tradition, kind of."
44:59;45:01;"- What would they call them, progressive?"
45:01;45:02;"I don't even know what we refer to them as."
45:02;45:04;"- I think the early albums, people referred to them"
45:04;45:05;"as punk or new wave."
45:05;45:08;"And then, yeah, doesn't fit as comfortably"
45:08;45:11;"into classic rock, even though they're truly a great band."

46:21;46:23;"about classic rock is that you were"
46:23;46:26;"in the 1998 American Godzilla."
46:26;46:31;"And that soundtrack looms very large for me"
46:31;46:33;"and probably a lot of us."
46:33;46:34;"- Is that right?"
46:34;46:36;"- It was just all over MTV in the late '90s."
46:36;46:38;"Do you remember the soundtrack much?"
46:38;46:41;"- I only remember the cover of ""Cashmere."""
46:41;46:42;"- Yeah, we brought that."
46:42;46:43;"- I remember that."
46:43;46:44;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
46:44;46:45;"- Dun-na-na."
46:45;46:45;"- Yeah."
46:45;46:46;"- So I'm wondering--"
46:46;46:48;"- But other than that, I do not remember."
46:48;46:48;"Yeah."
46:48;46:49;"- You remember hearing that?"
46:49;46:50;"Were you like, ""That's pretty cool."""
46:50;46:53;"Or were you just like, ""Sacrilege."""
46:53;46:54;"- No, I liked that."
46:54;46:54;"I liked that."
46:54;46:56;"- You thought that was tight that they were bringing it back?"
46:56;46:57;"- Yes."
46:57;46:59;"But other than that, I don't recall that soundtrack too much."
46:59;47:01;"- It just pulled it up."
47:01;47:03;"It's like a really strong group of bands."
47:03;47:06;"It veered alternative, which is interesting to think."
47:06;47:12;"Because especially today, just imagine that there's this huge, big budget action monster movie,"
47:12;47:15;"and somebody's like, ""We're going to spend a [expletive] load of money on the soundtrack."""
47:15;47:17;"And it's mostly rock bands."
47:17;47:18;"It just doesn't even make sense."
47:18;47:19;"But back then, it was--"
47:19;47:25;"They had The Wallflowers, Rage Against the Machine, Ben Folds Five, Fuel, Foo Fighters,"
47:25;47:27;"Green Day featuring Godzilla."
47:27;47:30;"I wonder what that sounds like."
47:30;47:32;"- I guess it's Godzilla just yelling a bunch."
47:32;47:35;"Well, that is a pretty impressive lineup."
47:35;47:37;"- Well, those were different times."
47:37;47:38;"That movie almost--"
47:38;47:43;"I almost wonder if that movie was the last one to do something like that musically."
47:43;47:50;"Because it became the symbol for Hollywood excess and style over substance."
47:50;47:52;"And there was a tremendous backlash to that movie."
47:52;47:53;"- Really?"
47:53;47:53;"- Oh, yeah."
47:53;47:55;"It was not received well."
47:55;47:57;"- I was 14, so I just remember being like, ""Hell, yeah."
47:57;47:58;"New Godzilla."""
47:58;48:01;"- That's how I felt too."
48:01;48:02;"But that was not how it was received."
48:02;48:05;"It almost ended my career, in fact."
48:05;48:06;"It was a pretty rough go."
48:06;48:06;"- Oh, really?"
48:06;48:08;"- Yeah, it was a tough--"
48:08;48:09;"The movie was a rough ride."
48:09;48:10;"- But it's this huge production."
48:10;48:15;"People associated you in particular with the movie compared to the director of a lot of--"
48:15;48:15;"- The movie had a little stink on it."
48:15;48:18;"It really did become the poster child for--"
48:18;48:21;"Because the ad campaign, they spent a ton of money promoting it."
48:21;48:25;"And the movie just didn't live up to the hype."
48:25;48:27;"And that was really rampant back then."
48:27;48:29;"This kind of like, ""Let's ram down your throat."""
48:29;48:32;"The marketing on this movie."
48:32;48:36;"And it's a foregone conclusion that you're going to buy the Happy Meal for it."
48:36;48:40;"And it just missed."
48:40;48:43;"And it really--"
48:43;48:43;"It was just--"
48:43;48:45;"People just loved to hate it."
48:45;48:46;"It was just one of those things."
48:46;48:49;"So anybody associated with it took a hit for at least a year."
48:49;48:52;"Probably except the bands involved."
48:52;48:55;"- I guess there's also just something about that era where--"
48:55;48:59;"Yeah, the late '90s was the pinnacle of just media excess, period."
48:59;49:05;"- 1999, people always talk about, was the biggest year for the music industry ever."
49:05;49:07;"They were selling 1899 CDs."
49:07;49:10;"It was kind of before the internet was changing things."
49:10;49:12;"So there might have just also been something in the air."
49:12;49:13;"People ready to hate."
49:13;49:19;"And just a general feeling about big budget films and albums or something."
49:19;49:21;"So I'm sure a bit of it was unfair."
49:21;49:22;"Just something in the air."
49:22;49:24;"- It was, but it wasn't a great movie either."
49:24;49:26;"I mean, it didn't deliver."
49:26;49:28;"I'm sure--"
49:28;49:30;"You're a 14-year-old self, I hope you enjoyed it."
49:30;49:34;"But when you look at it in terms of now, what gets done is kind of a fail."
49:34;49:34;"But anyway."
49:34;49:38;"- Well, the film and the soundtrack live on today."
49:38;49:43;"I encourage everybody to go check out that Green Day featuring Godzilla tune."
49:43;49:47;"So I guess the final question, obviously, we've talked a lot about classic rock."
49:47;49:50;"You say your taste was somewhat frozen in the early '90s."
49:50;49:52;"Is there anything new that you're keeping up with?"
49:52;49:54;"- Not really, no."
49:54;49:56;"I mean, I really pathetically know."
49:56;49:57;"You know what's funny?"
49:57;50:00;"It's like as Y2K approached, right?"
50:00;50:05;"And they were doing all these retrospectives on the decade and the whole century."
50:05;50:09;"I remember watching MTV Dance Party towards the new year."
50:09;50:14;"They literally scrolled through every single band that ever performed on MTV Dance Party."
50:14;50:16;"Going back to the '80s."
50:16;50:19;"And in chronological order."
50:19;50:21;"So I'm watching this thing like, well, of course I know."
50:21;50:24;"I wasn't even thinking in terms of I know these bands."
50:24;50:24;"Of course I knew them."
50:24;50:29;"And then as it approached 2000, I'm like, I don't know who they are."
50:29;50:29;"I don't know who they are."
50:29;50:33;"And it was such a weird thing to not know who a band was."
50:33;50:38;"And then the other benchmark of that was the first time I had no idea who the musical guest"
50:38;50:39;"on SNL was."
50:39;50:41;"I'm like, man, I'm just getting old now."
50:41;50:45;"And now, guys, I don't even know who the host is half the time."
50:45;50:47;"I'm like, is this actor?"
50:47;50:47;"I do not know."
50:47;50:48;"- Right."
50:48;50:49;"- And you know what's so weird?"
50:49;50:53;"It's to get to a certain age and I just feel like my dad."
50:53;50:58;"You know, I just like, wow, I get what the old man meant when he was like, who's this guy?"
50:58;51:01;"I'm like, how could you not know who this artist is?"
51:01;51:01;"Are you kidding?"
51:01;51:05;"They were the biggest selling performer like of the last five years."
51:05;51:06;"But now I totally get it."
51:06;51:09;"So no, I'm completely out of touch."
51:09;51:11;"- But you still listen to a lot of music?"
51:11;51:12;"You're doing back and forth."
51:12;51:16;"- Classic rock is a huge part of my day every day."
51:16;51:16;"And my son's 10."
51:16;51:21;"I take personal pride in the fact that I'm completely ramming classic rock down his throat."
51:21;51:23;"I'm sure he'll develop his own musical taste."
51:23;51:24;"- You know what you got to leave us with?"
51:24;51:28;"Top three best Doors songs for the lovers and the haters."
51:28;51:32;"What truly is the pinnacle of the Doors artistry off the top of your head?"
51:32;51:34;"- I'd say ""Riders on the Storm."""
51:34;51:35;"Amazing song."
51:35;51:36;"- That's a vibe as hell."
51:36;51:37;"I love that song."
51:37;51:39;"- I love ""Roadhouse Blues."""
51:39;51:42;"I just love their take on, and I love the movie ""Roadhouse"" as well."
51:42;51:43;"But that has nothing to do with it."
51:43;51:45;"But I'd say ""Roadhouse Blues."""
51:45;51:48;"And I'd say, I'm not going to say ""Light My Fire."""
51:48;51:50;"It's too played out."
51:50;51:51;"- Too entry level."
51:51;51:51;"- Yeah."
51:51;51:53;"Oh, ""LA Woman."""
51:53;51:55;"- I love that song."
51:55;51:56;"I would say those three songs."
51:56;51:59;"- Yeah, I feel like those three songs actually have something in common."
51:59;52:01;"That's like a kind of cool side of the Doors."
52:01;52:06;"And just so you know, David Crosby, because he was on the show recently,"
52:06;52:10;"his biggest complaint about the Doors is that he claimed they didn't cook."
52:10;52:12;"He said a good band cooks."
52:12;52:13;"The Doors didn't cook."
52:13;52:15;"He said it had to do with the lack of a bassist."
52:15;52:18;"But I think they're, I like the grooves of ""Riders on the Storm."""
52:18;52:19;"It's vibey."
52:19;52:20;"I think it cooks."
52:20;52:21;"- Yeah, I don't know."
52:21;52:25;"I mean, Ray Mancharek, if nobody else, just Ray on the keyboards cooked."
52:25;52:26;"I mean, for sure."
52:26;52:28;"I think that's indisputable."
52:28;52:31;"But looking at the thread, it was interesting people's comments."
52:31;52:34;"Like there were a lot of complaints about, is it Robbie Krieger?"
52:34;52:35;"Is that his name?"
52:35;52:35;"The guitarist?"
52:35;52:36;"- Yeah."
52:36;52:39;"- That he wasn't proficient enough."
52:39;52:44;"But you know, the other thing is, personally, I loved Springsteen and Tom Petty more."
52:44;52:47;"I was more of a fan of Springsteen and Tom Petty growing up."
52:47;52:50;"But I consider them more singer-songwriters."
52:50;52:51;"You take Tom Petty or Springsteen and--"
52:51;52:52;"- Right."
52:52;52:55;"- No offense to the East Street Band or the Heartbreakers, but you throw those guys with"
52:55;52:57;"anybody, they're going to be what those guys were."
52:57;52:57;"- Right."
52:57;52:59;"- To me, you know--"
52:59;53:02;"- On the most basic level, yeah, they weren't billed as a band in the same way that the"
53:02;53:03;"Rolling Stones were."
53:03;53:04;"- No."
53:04;53:10;"And truly, I think the Stones and the Beatles and Led Zepp, some was greater than their"
53:10;53:11;"parts."
53:11;53:13;"They were all contributing."
53:13;53:15;"And so Doors, same thing."
53:15;53:16;"I mean, they wrote together."
53:16;53:20;"- Yeah, you can really hear the way that they all came together to create a unique sound."
53:20;53:22;"- Yes, they truly collaborated."
53:22;53:27;"And I find that whole concept amazing, you know, the idea that guys can get together"
53:27;53:31;"and collaborate like that, as opposed to just somebody being a genius."
53:31;53:34;"I mean, it's amazing enough that anybody can write so well for themselves."
53:34;53:39;"But the idea that people come together to do that, just, I find endlessly fascinating."
53:39;53:44;"Like, in any documentaries that really show how torturous that process is, it's always"
53:44;53:47;"so painful for these guys to actually work together."
53:47;53:49;"It's like bands break up."
53:49;53:55;"And working in scripted, like this last show I did, Brockmire, I felt like I hooked up"
53:55;53:58;"with a writer that--I would think about it in terms of music a lot."
53:58;54:02;"I always felt like the way I connected with this writer on that show was, must be how"
54:02;54:07;"bands felt when, just for some reason, the way somebody writes connects with the way"
54:07;54:08;"somebody plays and vice versa."
54:08;54:12;"And they just kind of spur each other on, you know?"
54:12;54:13;"- Absolutely."
54:13;54:20;"Yeah, or the relationship between bands and producers, instrumentalists, songwriters,"
54:20;54:23;"singers who sometimes sing other people's stuff and interpret it."
54:23;54:24;"Yeah, absolutely."
54:24;54:25;"There's real commonality there."
54:25;54:26;"- Yeah."
54:26;54:29;"- Well, hopefully you don't get in hot water with David Crosby."
54:29;54:31;"- I can handle it."
54:31;54:33;"I think he did--I'm sure he did The Simpsons too."
54:33;54:34;"I'm pretty sure he did."
54:34;54:38;"- Yeah, I can actually--it's very easy to picture him as in The Simpsons style, just"
54:38;54:40;"like with his mustache and stuff."
54:40;54:42;"But he's beefing pretty hard with Neil Young right now."
54:43;54:43;"They've got a very--"
54:43;54:44;"- Oh, is he really?"
54:44;54:50;"- Yeah, he made a comment, a derogatory comment about Neil Young's girlfriend or maybe wife,"
54:50;54:52;"Daryl Hannah, a few years back."
54:52;54:53;"And he apologized."
54:53;54:56;"He said, ""I was just shooting my mouth off, but now Neil won't get back to him."""
54:56;55:01;"And he kind of wants to, you know, link up with the whole CSNY crew to help get Joe Biden"
55:01;55:03;"elected, but Neil's icing him."
55:03;55:05;"- I love those guys too."
55:05;55:08;"I mean, yeah, talk about an amazing band."
55:08;55:08;"- Right."
55:08;55:10;"But Neil is Canadian, kind of."
55:10;55:11;"- Yes, I know."
55:11;55:14;"- That discredits the whole CSNY enterprise as far as the--"
55:14;55:15;"- And one of them's English, aren't they?"
55:15;55:17;"- Oh, yeah, right."
55:17;55:18;"Nash."
55:18;55:19;"- Graham Nash."
55:19;55:20;"Yeah, he's English, yeah."
55:20;55:22;"- A truly international crew."
55:22;55:24;"- Here's--I'll leave you with this last question, please."
55:24;55:27;"- Well, no, you guys are too young for this."
55:27;55:27;"Never mind."
55:27;55:28;"It's the other Poconite favorite."
55:28;55:30;"- What's the other Poconite favorite?"
55:30;55:31;"I want to hear it."
55:31;55:33;"- It's first concert and where."
55:33;55:38;"It's a great question to ask somebody over the age of 40 because the answers are ridiculous."
55:38;55:39;"- I bet."
55:39;55:40;"I always wished I had a better answer."
55:40;55:41;"- For that."
55:41;55:46;"Mine was the Ska Against Racism concert, which had a lot of good '90s ska bands,"
55:46;55:49;"but then you got to explain the whole concept to everybody."
55:49;55:49;"It's not the same one."
55:49;55:51;"Did you have a good answer to that?"
55:51;55:55;"- Mine was Jethro Tull at Madison Square Garden in 1976."
55:55;55:56;"That's a pretty good one."
55:56;55:57;"- Oh, wow."
55:57;55:58;"- Yeah."
55:58;56:02;"I saw Tull last year at the Beacon in New York, and they were great musically,"
56:02;56:06;"but poor Ian Anderson, his voice is just sadly totally shot."
56:06;56:07;"- But still shredding on the flute?"
56:07;56:08;"- Oh, amazing."
56:08;56:12;"I mean, has lost no step musically."
56:12;56:13;"- Oh, well, he's still got that."
56:13;56:15;"- Yeah."
56:15;56:16;"But anyway, guys, thanks for chatting."
56:16;56:18;"- Thanks so much, Hank Azaria."
56:18;56:24;"Thank you for calling in, and also thank you for keeping the debates about classic rock alive"
56:24;56:26;"in 2020."
56:26;56:26;"We appreciate that."
56:26;56:29;"- I was so pleased people really got into that."
56:29;56:29;"It was fun."
56:29;56:31;"- All right."
56:31;56:32;"Well, have a good one."
56:32;56:32;"Thanks so much."
56:32;56:33;"- Take care, guys."
56:33;56:34;"Have a good night."
56:34;56:34;"- Night."
56:34;56:39;"- Riders on the storm."
56:39;56:43;"Riders on the storm."
56:43;56:48;"Into this house we're born."
56:48;56:52;"Into this world we're thrown."
56:52;56:58;"Like a dog without a bone and actor out of love."
56:58;57:02;"Riders on the storm."
57:02;57:06;"There's a killer on the road."
57:06;57:11;"His brain is squirming like a toad."
57:11;57:16;"Take a long holiday."
57:16;57:21;"Let your children play."
57:21;57:26;"If you give this man a ride, sweet lamb, he will die."
57:26;57:29;"Killer on the road."
57:29;57:31;"Yeah."
57:32;57:36;"- Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
57:36;57:38;"- Keep your eyes on the road."
57:38;57:44;"Your hands up on the wheel."
57:44;57:46;"Keep your eyes on the road."
57:46;57:51;"Your hands up on the wheel."
57:51;57:54;"Yeah, we're going to the roadhouse."
57:54;57:59;"It's gonna have a real good time."
57:59;58:03;"- Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
58:03;58:06;"- This show rolls."
58:06;58:12;"- Well, I dig a little down about an hour ago."
58:12;58:18;"Took a look around there with a windblow."
58:18;58:23;"With a little girl in a Hollywood bungalow."
58:23;58:29;"Are you a lucky little lady in the city of light?"
58:29;58:34;"Or did you not a lost angel in the city of night?"
58:34;58:37;"City of night."
58:37;58:40;"City of night."
58:40;58:41;"City of night."
58:41;58:41;"- Woo!"
58:41;58:43;"- Oh!"
58:43;58:48;"- Well, it's safe that we have officially two celebrity"
58:48;58:51;"opinions on the doors and their ability"
58:51;58:54;"to cook registered on Time Crisis."
58:54;58:58;"We got a no from Crosby, and we got a yes from Azaria."
58:58;59:00;"I think the doors cook in their own way, man,"
59:00;59:01;"the more I think about it."
59:01;59:04;"- We should add, what do you think of the doors"
59:04;59:08;"to the TC bundle of questions that we ask every guest?"
59:08;59:11;"- That's true, because there is something about--"
59:11;59:16;"there is a way in which Jerry and Jim are kind of like--"
59:16;59:18;"similar to Jamflow Man and Joker Man,"
59:18;59:23;"Jerry and Jim are kind of like yin-yang opposing deities,"
59:23;59:26;"where nobody could ever call Jerry a poser."
59:26;59:30;"I mean, Jerry is the original of a certain type of person."
59:30;59:30;"You know?"
59:30;59:31;"He's the original."
59:31;59:32;"- Yeah."
59:32;59:37;"- And Jerry's vibe is like the sweet, nice smile, exploratory,"
59:37;59:42;"very talented musician, whereas Morrison, just singing,"
59:42;59:43;"can't shred."
59:43;59:45;"Like, even though they both, I guess,"
59:45;59:47;"use pretentious language, so to speak,"
59:47;59:49;"Jerry always feels fun and playful,"
59:49;59:51;"Morrison's so serious and stuff."
59:51;59:55;"And I could totally see the ways in which,"
59:55;59:56;"despite being so similar--"
59:56;59:58;"you know, Northern California, the dead,"
59:58;59:59;"Southern California, the doors--"
59:59;01:00:02;"there's a lot of ways that they're kind of like a yin-yang."
01:00:02;01:00:04;"So it is interesting to see people who like the doors,"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"but not the dead, and vice versa."
01:00:06;01:00:07;"- Right."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"- I think a really chill person is probably like,"
01:00:09;01:00:10;"""You know, man, I like both."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"There's some cool stuff in there."""
01:00:11;01:00:14;"- Yeah, I feel like people are too hard on the doors."
01:00:14;01:00:17;"They had an incredibly original sound."
01:00:17;01:00:18;"You have to give them that."
01:00:18;01:00:18;"- Jesus."
01:00:18;01:00:20;"- Did the last time we talked about this,"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"I can't remember, have we sort of tied"
01:00:22;01:00:24;"the sort of backlash into the film?"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"- Well, yeah, I was saying that in the interview."
01:00:26;01:00:29;"Yeah, I think people probably sometimes are reacting"
01:00:29;01:00:32;"to the Val Kilmer version of Jim Morrison"
01:00:32;01:00:36;"more than Jim himself, but I just think it became--"
01:00:36;01:00:37;"- But also just a Stone--"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"an Oliver Stone backlash."
01:00:39;01:00:42;"- Yeah, people associating Jim Morrison and Oliver Stone"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"with some sort of just like played out,"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"like, bloviating white dude."
01:00:46;01:00:48;"I think is probably part of it."
01:00:48;01:00:51;"There probably is something where people got sick"
01:00:51;01:00:54;"of being like, ""Oh, Jim Morrison, he's so important."""
01:00:54;01:00:55;"And they probably like reacted a little bit."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"But yeah, their music, as we've talked about,"
01:00:57;01:01:00;"five to one, there's a reason that got sampled"
01:01:00;01:01:01;"by Jay-Z 30 years later."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"It just sounds-- it's hard."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"It sounds crazy."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"It's cool."
01:01:05;01:01:07;"I think people are definitely too hard on the doors."
01:01:07;01:01:11;"I think at this point, that's the time crisis party line."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"We're not saying the doors are the best American band,"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"but we are saying people are just a little too hard on them."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"You know, chill out."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"They got some tunes."
01:01:18;01:01:21;"I also feel like people always had that poster"
01:01:21;01:01:24;"of Jim Morrison that said, ""An American poet."""
01:01:24;01:01:26;"People don't like when you call yourself a poet,"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"which is why probably when we finally make"
01:01:28;01:01:29;"""Painter vs. Poet,"" the film,"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"I think the poet has to lose."
01:01:31;01:01:32;"- Absolutely."
01:01:32;01:01:36;"(laughing)"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"- I guess 'cause we're talking about rock movies,"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"we might as well talk a little bit about ""I'm Not There"" now."
01:01:41;01:01:43;"We'll get to those FOTB emails."
01:01:43;01:01:43;"- Oh yeah."
01:01:43;01:01:46;"So Jake, we were talking about ""I'm Not There."""
01:01:46;01:01:47;"You threw it on."
01:01:47;01:01:49;"We talked about making that a TC watch."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"I started watching it."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"I'm curious what your take is"
01:01:51;01:01:54;"'cause first things first, I told Rashida,"
01:01:54;01:01:58;"""I gotta watch 'I'm Not There' for TC homework."""
01:01:58;01:01:59;"I said, ""Have you ever seen that movie?"""
01:01:59;01:02:00;"And she said, ""No, I never saw it,"
01:02:00;01:02:03;"but I love Todd Haynes, the director."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"I'm curious to see it."""
01:02:04;01:02:05;"And I was like, ""Oh, you wanna watch it?"""
01:02:05;01:02:06;"And I remember seeing it."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"I thought it came out when I was in college."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"It came out one year after I was in college, 2007."
01:02:10;01:02:13;"So that was probably like early ""Vampire Weekend"" days"
01:02:13;01:02:14;"or first album hadn't even come out."
01:02:14;01:02:17;"I feel like that era is a very random time"
01:02:17;01:02:18;"for independent film."
01:02:18;01:02:21;"But because I was in college and living in New York"
01:02:21;01:02:25;"from 2002 until ""Vampire Weekend"" popped up,"
01:02:25;01:02:30;"I saw so many movies at movie theaters from that era."
01:02:30;01:02:32;"And it was not the strongest era for independent cinema,"
01:02:32;01:02:33;"but I saw all of them."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"There were some good movies,"
01:02:34;01:02:38;"but I feel like I just feel like going to the movie theater"
01:02:38;01:02:41;"and seeing like late period Jim Jarmusch movies"
01:02:41;01:02:44;"and ""I'm Not There"" like ""Secretary,"""
01:02:44;01:02:46;"""24-Hour Party People."""
01:02:46;01:02:48;"It was like, wasn't the '90s anymore"
01:02:48;01:02:50;"and wasn't the internet era."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"It was this very specific era of film."
01:02:52;01:02:53;"So I can remember going to see that movie"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"in a movie theater."
01:02:55;01:02:56;"And I couldn't remember what I thought."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"I remember there were some sections"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"that made a big impression on me."
01:03:00;01:03:01;"But so we threw on the movie"
01:03:01;01:03:02;"and then right off the bat,"
01:03:02;01:03:06;"you have the young kid on the train saying that he's like,"
01:03:06;01:03:07;"""My name is Woody Guthrie, folks."""
01:03:07;01:03:09;"And I was just like, ""Oh God, what is this?"""
01:03:09;01:03:11;"And I was kind of like seeing it through her eyes too."
01:03:11;01:03:14;"Or I was just like,"
01:03:14;01:03:17;"and I never said like I was writing for the movie."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"I was just like, ""Yeah, we're going to watch it"
01:03:18;01:03:20;"because Bob Dylan, like time crisis."""
01:03:20;01:03:22;"And the first 20 minutes of the movie,"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"I found like excruciating."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"And then once it got to the Cate Blanchett"
01:03:26;01:03:27;"and the black and white"
01:03:27;01:03:32;"and the '70s stuff with Heath Ledger and Christian Bale,"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"then I remembered that that movie"
01:03:34;01:03:36;"has like some truly like transcendent moments"
01:03:36;01:03:39;"and like well-directed, beautiful stuff."
01:03:39;01:03:41;"But the beginning was tough for me."
01:03:41;01:03:42;"What's your take, Jake?"
01:03:42;01:03:46;"- It's time for Jake's Takes on Time Crisis."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"- It's a double-edged sword."
01:03:48;01:03:52;"You have to be a huge Dylan head"
01:03:52;01:03:55;"to have any sort of like connection with this movie."
01:03:55;01:03:58;"And if the problem with like most biopics"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"is that they're too broad"
01:04:00;01:04:02;"and they like just kind of play the greatest hits"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"from this like icons history"
01:04:04;01:04:08;"and it ends up being kind of like bland."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"This movie goes the opposite direction."
01:04:10;01:04:13;"It goes obscure and it goes,"
01:04:13;01:04:15;"yeah, I mean, even if you're a Dylan fan,"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"you're like trying to put it together"
01:04:17;01:04:18;"like it's some sort of puzzle."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"I loved it."
01:04:19;01:04:22;"I hated it when I saw it in '07 in the theater."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"- Yeah. - Loved it."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"This time I watched it twice."
01:04:25;01:04:27;"- You watched it twice? - I did."
01:04:27;01:04:29;"- Okay, but you hated the first 20 minutes"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"or excruciating. - Yes."
01:04:31;01:04:34;"I agree the scenes with the 12-year-old kid"
01:04:34;01:04:38;"playing Woody Guthrie are the weakest link in the film."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"- It's too far of a reach. - Can I pause at a theory?"
01:04:40;01:04:40;"Yes."
01:04:40;01:04:43;"I think that that's sort of on purpose"
01:04:43;01:04:48;"and that what they're saying is that period of Dylan's life"
01:04:48;01:04:51;"where he is co-opting Americana"
01:04:51;01:04:54;"in a much more performative way"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"is a little corny and excruciating."
01:04:56;01:04:57;"It was corny."
01:04:57;01:04:58;"I think there's an element of that."
01:04:58;01:05:01;"I think that's a fair analysis because"
01:05:01;01:05:03;"and for any TCAs who didn't watch the film,"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"even though it was assigned for viewing,"
01:05:06;01:05:09;"basically what's really confusing about the movie"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"is it's not quite as straightforward as being like"
01:05:11;01:05:14;"an experimental film where six different people"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"play Bob Dylan at different moments in his life."
01:05:16;01:05:18;"People of different races and genders."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"It's not that straightforward."
01:05:19;01:05:22;"Actually, nobody in the movie plays Bob Dylan."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"People all have different names"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"and some people play Woody Guthrie"
01:05:26;01:05:28;"or some people play somebody pretending to be Wood Guthrie"
01:05:28;01:05:31;"and somebody plays some folk singer named Jack Rollins"
01:05:31;01:05:33;"and somebody plays an actor who played that folk singer"
01:05:33;01:05:34;"in a movie."
01:05:34;01:05:36;"So it's very confusing and it's,"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"yeah, you need to be a real Dylan fan to make a case for it"
01:05:38;01:05:40;"because even as we were watching it"
01:05:40;01:05:44;"and I felt like some duty to explain some of it"
01:05:44;01:05:47;"when she was like, ""Wait, was there a famous movie"
01:05:47;01:05:48;"where somebody played Bob Dylan"
01:05:48;01:05:51;"that this Heath Ledger character is based on this actor?"""
01:05:51;01:05:53;"And I was like, ""I don't think so."""
01:05:53;01:05:56;"""What do you think the point of that is?"""
01:05:56;01:05:59;"And I really had to try to interpret"
01:05:59;01:06:02;"and I was like, ""Okay, I think for hardcore Dylan fans,"
01:06:02;01:06:05;"this idea that Dylan entered a period"
01:06:05;01:06:09;"where he became almost like an actor playing himself,"
01:06:09;01:06:10;"where there was something changed"
01:06:10;01:06:13;"about his relationship to his own persona"
01:06:13;01:06:17;"represents kind of his transition into the late 60s"
01:06:17;01:06:19;"and there's something about them creating a character"
01:06:19;01:06:21;"who's an actor who played a folk singer"
01:06:21;01:06:25;"that somehow maybe is reminiscent of one facet"
01:06:25;01:06:28;"of Bob Dylan's personality or career."""
01:06:28;01:06:30;"You know, so you got to kind of interpret everything"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"in like a weird way like that in this film."
01:06:32;01:06:36;"I saw it as the Christian Bale personification"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"of Dylan, aka Jack Rawlins,"
01:06:39;01:06:43;"was like he was the hero of like a small local scene"
01:06:43;01:06:46;"and then that scene blew up"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"and became super prominent on a national scale"
01:06:49;01:06:53;"and they made a movie about the Christian Bale character"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"and at that point, he transforms"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"into the Cate Blanchett version"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"where he becomes like a media figure."
01:06:59;01:07:02;"He's no longer like a local hero, you know?"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"And Cate Blanchett is excellent."
01:07:04;01:07:05;"Oh my God."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"And she was actually nominated for an Oscar for that role,"
01:07:07;01:07:08;"which is totally fair."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"And those parts are beautifully shot."
01:07:10;01:07:12;"I also didn't realize the first time"
01:07:12;01:07:13;"that a lot of that,"
01:07:13;01:07:17;"the black and white Cate Blanchett '66 Dylan stuff,"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"but the way he shot it is also this homage"
01:07:19;01:07:20;"to like ""Fellini"" eight and a half."
01:07:20;01:07:24;"Also a movie that's about kind of deconstructing"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"the artistic process and what it means to be an artist"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"who has to engage with the public."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"So there's also like this interesting meta,"
01:07:30;01:07:33;"dare I say, Borgesian element to the filmmaking"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"that's very referential."

01:08:36;01:08:37;"The reason that we started talking about this"
01:08:37;01:08:39;"in the first place is because, Jake, you've been,"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"we should do a show on it soon,"
01:08:41;01:08:44;"but you've been digging into kind of early Christian rock"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"going back to the 60s and 70s."
01:08:46;01:08:49;"And there's something to me that really stayed with me"
01:08:49;01:08:52;"about the scene where the late period Christian bell,"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"Dylan has become Christian"
01:08:54;01:08:58;"and is performing at a church in Stockton, California."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"That's so vibey."
01:08:59;01:09:00;"And I love that."
01:09:00;01:09:01;"And also why Stockton?"
01:09:01;01:09:04;"Yeah, I love that stuff when bell comes back."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"Can I also just say shout out to From the Freezer,"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"who's from Stockton?"
01:09:08;01:09:09;"Yeah, what's it about Stockton?"
01:09:09;01:09:10;"Pavements from Stockton,"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"From the Freezers from Stockton."
01:09:12;01:09:14;"There's some kind of interesting energy"
01:09:14;01:09:15;"in the Central Valley."
01:09:15;01:09:17;"Yeah, well, I was just gonna say,"
01:09:17;01:09:21;"like, I think part of the strength of the Blanchette scenes,"
01:09:22;01:09:25;"it's so clearly based on the Pennebaker footage"
01:09:25;01:09:27;"that he shot for that documentary,"
01:09:27;01:09:30;"where it's like, it is the most iconic footage of Dylan"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"that was filmed."
01:09:32;01:09:33;"Don't look back."
01:09:33;01:09:36;"And so like, we're watching like a facsimile"
01:09:36;01:09:37;"of that iconic footage."
01:09:37;01:09:40;"And I just feel like as the audience,"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"we're relating to our relationship"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"with that footage already,"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"where everything else was just made up whole cloth."
01:09:46;01:09:47;"Right."
01:09:47;01:09:50;"And one of my favorite parts of that was the press conference."
01:09:50;01:09:52;"And it got me thinking about like,"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"the tradition of the rock star press conference."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"Yeah, the ones that always come to mind for me,"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"of course, you have the Beatles."
01:09:59;01:10:00;"Yes."
01:10:00;01:10:02;"Literally just the four of them just riffing."
01:10:02;01:10:05;"Then you have Bob Dylan riffing in the 60s."
01:10:05;01:10:07;"And then I always think of the Eagles reunion"
01:10:07;01:10:08;"in the early 90s,"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"and then like sitting at a press conference"
01:10:10;01:10:11;"to announce that their comeback tour."
01:10:11;01:10:14;"Maybe it's because I've watched the Eagles doc so many times."
01:10:14;01:10:19;"But yeah, the concept of like a rock star doing,"
01:10:19;01:10:22;"or any kind of music star doing a press conference is so funny,"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"because now you have artists who literally just don't do press"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"because they don't need to,"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"or they do it in a very, very controlled way."
01:10:28;01:10:30;"So to imagine somebody literally just having"
01:10:30;01:10:33;"40 people in front of them just throwing questions."
01:10:33;01:10:33;"Wild."
01:10:33;01:10:34;"Like they're the president,"
01:10:34;01:10:37;"and just having to like riff and get into it"
01:10:37;01:10:38;"and have to be witty and stuff."
01:10:38;01:10:39;"It's wild."
01:10:39;01:10:40;"And one thought that I had,"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"and this is not an original thought,"
01:10:42;01:10:45;"but it maybe is worth saying just for the sake of argument."
01:10:45;01:10:48;"As I watch this movie,"
01:10:48;01:10:49;"and I think about Bob Dylan,"
01:10:49;01:10:54;"who is this interesting mix of like these very distinct eras,"
01:10:54;01:10:57;"all these different facets of his personality,"
01:10:57;01:10:59;"somebody who meant so much to people,"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"but also bitterly disappointed them."
01:11:01;01:11:04;"Somebody who was supposed to represent"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"a new kind of political consciousness,"
01:11:06;01:11:07;"and then veered in these other directions"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"that really bothered people."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"Somebody who was just,"
01:11:10;01:11:13;"was such an artist and in such a way with words,"
01:11:13;01:11:16;"but also was just so fascinating as a person."
01:11:16;01:11:17;"The person that I always think of,"
01:11:17;01:11:18;"especially when I watch the movie,"
01:11:18;01:11:20;"is Kanye."
01:11:20;01:11:25;"And I know obviously all major artists have something in common."
01:11:25;01:11:26;"And people could say,"
01:11:26;01:11:29;"""Well, is Kanye our prince or something?"""
01:11:29;01:11:32;"You could compare a million different superstar artists,"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"and you could always have fun with that."
01:11:34;01:11:36;"Say like, ""Well, is, you know, if Beyonce,"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"who's the Beyonce of classic rock?"
01:11:38;01:11:39;"Led Zeppelin?"""
01:11:39;01:11:40;"You know, of course,"
01:11:40;01:11:43;"all major artists have something in common."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"There's something about Kanye and Dylan"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"in terms of what they mean to people,"
01:11:47;01:11:49;"and their kind of,"
01:11:49;01:11:50;"the ups and downs of their career,"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"and their anger,"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"and their, the way they've shifted,"
01:11:54;01:11:57;"and the different types of personalities they've had,"
01:11:57;01:11:59;"or they've at least presented to the world."
01:11:59;01:12:01;"I don't know why I associate those two."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"Of all the icons of, you know,"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"post-war American popular music,"
01:12:05;01:12:07;"I think of them the most similarly."
01:12:07;01:12:10;"And there's something about the Bob Dylan press conference"
01:12:10;01:12:13;"makes me think about the, that era."
01:12:13;01:12:14;"I guess it's still kind of a big deal"
01:12:14;01:12:15;"when Kanye does an interview."
01:12:15;01:12:17;"But starting with the Zane Lowe,"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"shout out to Apple Music Beats 1,"
01:12:19;01:12:22;"starting with the Zane Lowe interview,"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"where he interviewed Kanye,"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"it became this thing where Kanye interviews"
01:12:25;01:12:26;"became an event in a way that"
01:12:26;01:12:31;"no other musicians' interviews were like an event."
01:12:31;01:12:31;"- Yeah."
01:12:31;01:12:33;"- People just want to get to the bottom of like,"
01:12:33;01:12:34;"""Where do you stand?"
01:12:34;01:12:35;"What do you mean?"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"What do you actually care about, Kanye?"""
01:12:37;01:12:38;"In a way that,"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"I'm not saying there aren't great interviews"
01:12:40;01:12:41;"with other artists,"
01:12:41;01:12:41;"but there's,"
01:12:41;01:12:44;"there was something picturing Bob Dylan,"
01:12:44;01:12:45;"like these older journalists,"
01:12:45;01:12:47;"just like asking like these questions,"
01:12:47;01:12:48;"""Explain the world to me."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"What do you mean, Bob Dylan?"""
01:12:50;01:12:52;"- Incredibly earnest questions."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"- It makes me think of Kanye more than anybody."
01:12:54;01:12:56;"- You know who kind of did that a little bit?"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"Father John Misty."
01:12:58;01:12:59;"- Mm."
01:12:59;01:13:01;"- He relished in like,"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"semi-confrontational interviews,"
01:13:03;01:13:05;"I feel like, a few years ago at least."
01:13:05;01:13:06;"- No, absolutely."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"And he's also got a way with words."
01:13:08;01:13:09;"- Yeah."
01:13:09;01:13:12;"- He's smart and he's interesting to follow."
01:13:12;01:13:13;"And I like Father John Misty."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"It's just not the same as like the Kanyes and the Dylans"
01:13:17;01:13:18;"in terms of like,"
01:13:18;01:13:21;"people are interested in what Father John Misty has to say"
01:13:21;01:13:23;"and he's always going to have an interesting take."
01:13:23;01:13:24;"But it's like,"
01:13:24;01:13:27;"he's the observer in a way that these guys,"
01:13:27;01:13:30;"people felt like to understand Kanye and Dylan"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"is to understand what's happening in the world."
01:13:32;01:13:35;"It's a very strange, unique phenomenon."
01:13:35;01:13:39;"- I mean, when we were talking about the greatest bands,"
01:13:39;01:13:40;"I know he's not a band,"
01:13:40;01:13:41;"but I was like,"
01:13:41;01:13:43;"or in terms of the greatest American bands,"
01:13:43;01:13:44;"I was like,"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"I know we can't include solo artists,"
01:13:46;01:13:47;"but I'm doing it and it's Bob Dylan."
01:13:47;01:13:48;"- I know."
01:13:48;01:13:49;"Well, that's the funny thing."
01:13:49;01:13:50;"- That's me."
01:13:50;01:13:52;"- There's something about America that it's produced,"
01:13:52;01:13:57;"our solo artists, iconic singer-songwriter types,"
01:13:57;01:14:01;"I think are as good as any other anglophone country."
01:14:01;01:14:03;"But there's something--"
01:14:03;01:14:05;"- Isn't that also particularly American, right?"
01:14:05;01:14:08;"Like that it's the focus on the individual,"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"that we've made these like strong individual--"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"- I've wondered that because actually,"
01:14:12;01:14:13;"yeah, I want to go back to that for a second."
01:14:13;01:14:17;"Like maybe because of like reading Stephen Hyden's book"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"and think a lot about Radiohead and stuff."
01:14:19;01:14:19;"'Cause actually, Jake,"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"I feel like you and I have talked about this."
01:14:21;01:14:25;"There's a certain type of band that just can't be American."
01:14:25;01:14:26;"And I've wondered,"
01:14:26;01:14:28;"is it because America is like the rugged individualist,"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"so we've produced more Bob Dylan's and Bruce Springsteen's,"
01:14:30;01:14:32;"but we've also had great bands like the Dead,"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"but then there are these kind of like fun,"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"more amorphous things."
01:14:36;01:14:38;"We just don't have that many bands in that sweet spot."
01:14:38;01:14:40;"And I'm not sure why."
01:14:40;01:14:41;"This is very specific,"
01:14:41;01:14:45;"but one type of band that there's always been one,"
01:14:45;01:14:46;"there's always that kind of like"
01:14:46;01:14:51;"slightly like spacey, gigantic band."
01:14:51;01:14:53;"Arguably it was like Pink Floyd,"
01:14:53;01:14:54;"and then it became Radiohead."
01:14:54;01:14:58;"And then it splintered into like Muse and bands like that."
01:14:58;01:15:01;"Where it's this kind of like epic arena rock,"
01:15:01;01:15:05;"progressive band that has music that connotes like space"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"and paranoia and you know what I mean?"
01:15:07;01:15:08;"- Yeah."
01:15:08;01:15:10;"- These bands are so different."
01:15:10;01:15:11;"I'm not trying to like be basic and be like,"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"Radiohead is the Pink Floyd of our day."
01:15:13;01:15:16;"I'm just saying that they occupy a space"
01:15:16;01:15:17;"for a type of listener."
01:15:17;01:15:18;"And I'm not saying everybody would,"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"people might like one and not the other."
01:15:20;01:15:22;"And maybe even today a little bit,"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"Tame Impala has some of that vibe"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"with the psychedelics dark,"
01:15:26;01:15:27;"'cause there's some bad,"
01:15:27;01:15:29;"Tame Impala is way more Pink Floyd than Grateful Dead,"
01:15:29;01:15:31;"even though those are arguably both"
01:15:31;01:15:32;"psychedelic types of bands."
01:15:32;01:15:35;"And I like all these bands,"
01:15:35;01:15:38;"but I'm very convinced that America"
01:15:38;01:15:42;"cannot produce a Pink Floyd, Radiohead or Tame Impala."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"I don't know why,"
01:15:44;01:15:47;"but I think you have to be English or Australian."
01:15:47;01:15:49;"I think we talked about this before Jake,"
01:15:49;01:15:50;"maybe not on air,"
01:15:50;01:15:53;"that remember in the early 2000s,"
01:15:53;01:15:55;"two of the most critically acclaimed bands"
01:15:55;01:15:56;"were Radiohead and Wilco."
01:15:56;01:15:58;"And sometimes Wilco would get referred to"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"as the American Radiohead."
01:16:00;01:16:03;"It was kind of like after Yankee Hotel Foxtrot."
01:16:03;01:16:04;"I think people would be like,"
01:16:04;01:16:05;"well, Kid A and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,"
01:16:05;01:16:08;"those are two albums about like the state of the world."
01:16:08;01:16:09;"- Preposterous. - And I like Wilco"
01:16:09;01:16:10;"and I like Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,"
01:16:10;01:16:12;"but I was just always like,"
01:16:12;01:16:13;"no, it's not the same."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"- Yeah, Wilco's rootsy."
01:16:14;01:16:16;"- Wilco's rootsy. - Radiohead is space rock."
01:16:16;01:16:18;"I mean, basically it's like,"
01:16:18;01:16:21;"there are like American space rock bands"
01:16:21;01:16:22;"who are like indie."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"God knows there's a ton of them,"
01:16:24;01:16:25;"but like-- - Like who?"
01:16:25;01:16:28;"- I don't know, explosions in the sky,"
01:16:28;01:16:29;"that's instrumental."
01:16:29;01:16:32;"I've played enough shows and enough all ages clubs"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"and bars over the last 20 years,"
01:16:34;01:16:35;"and I've seen enough boring,"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"like kind of shoegazy space rock bands,"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"God loves some of them."
01:16:39;01:16:42;"My friend Adam had a band called Umebitsu for years,"
01:16:42;01:16:45;"classic '90s space rock."
01:16:45;01:16:50;"But your question is a space rock band that is massive."
01:16:50;01:16:53;"- That's massive, that speaks to the cultural moment"
01:16:53;01:16:54;"or something."
01:16:54;01:16:56;"I don't think we as Americans-- - Yeah."
01:16:56;01:16:58;"- Want to hear that kind of (beep)"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"from our countrymen, you know what I mean?"
01:17:00;01:17:03;"- What about Tom DeLonge's ""Angels and Airwaves""?"
01:17:03;01:17:04;"- What about what?"
01:17:04;01:17:05;"- Okay, you got me there."
01:17:05;01:17:07;"- ""Angels and Airwaves,"" Tom DeLonge."
01:17:07;01:17:09;"- ""Angels and Airwaves"" though is like,"
01:17:09;01:17:12;"even though obviously Tom DeLonge is very ahead of the curve"
01:17:12;01:17:16;"in terms of his interest in aliens and exposing,"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"I don't know if he would use that language,"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"but exposing their existence."
01:17:20;01:17:22;"""Angels and Airwaves"" is still more of this,"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"has the pop punk emo roots,"
01:17:24;01:17:26;"even though it's getting kind of spacey."
01:17:26;01:17:29;"- I was gonna say one band that's sort of from the '90s"
01:17:29;01:17:32;"that sort of starts to veer into this territory"
01:17:32;01:17:33;"was the Smashing Pumpkins."
01:17:33;01:17:35;"They were-- - Yes, that's an interesting point."
01:17:35;01:17:37;"- Heavy and psychedelic. - Yeah."
01:17:37;01:17:39;"- Also the Flaming Lips, that's a good point, Seinfeld."
01:17:39;01:17:41;"Seinfeld just texted me the Flaming Lips."
01:17:41;01:17:44;"- But the Flaming Lips are still,"
01:17:44;01:17:47;"they've got that court jester, American kind of--"
01:17:47;01:17:48;"- It's scrappy."
01:17:48;01:17:50;"- I mean, they don't sound like the dead,"
01:17:50;01:17:53;"but they have in common that kind of scrappy American,"
01:17:53;01:17:58;"like P.T. Barnum and Charlie Chan."
01:17:58;01:18:00;"You know, they have that American huckster,"
01:18:00;01:18:03;"we're in on the joke, we're just having a good time."
01:18:03;01:18:06;"Wayne Coyne is like a funny dude"
01:18:06;01:18:09;"in the same way that the dead had a sense of humor."
01:18:09;01:18:10;"Yeah, no, that's interesting."
01:18:10;01:18:11;"Billy Corgan and Tom York,"
01:18:11;01:18:14;"I'm sure Tom York would shudder to hear it,"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"but they have something in common."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"But even then, I just feel like the idea,"
01:18:18;01:18:22;"Americans don't wanna hear a dude from Chicago"
01:18:22;01:18:25;"be their Tom York or their Roger Waters."

01:19:36;01:19:39;"- One other band I thought of that is super serious,"
01:19:39;01:19:42;"and I actually thought of them in terms of the,"
01:19:42;01:19:43;"if you're talking about greatest American bands,"
01:19:43;01:19:46;"you have to think about '60s and '70s,"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"like Hank was saying, is like the classic rock era."
01:19:48;01:19:51;"And then there's sort of the post-punk era,"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"that'll have the last 40 years or whatever."
01:19:53;01:19:56;"One band I thought of, super serious, Fugazi."
01:19:56;01:19:57;"- Great band, iconic band."
01:19:57;01:20:00;"Obviously no hits, but there is that sort of strain"
01:20:00;01:20:04;"of American music that is like, coming out of hardcore,"
01:20:04;01:20:08;"that is like pretty humorless and very intense."
01:20:08;01:20:10;"Not spacey at all."
01:20:10;01:20:12;"I'm just saying, it's not all like--"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"- There's absolutely something to it."
01:20:14;01:20:15;"And I think a lot of these bands,"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"like a Fugazi or something,"
01:20:17;01:20:21;"help tee up ideas and sounds that probably influence,"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"maybe even some of the bands we're talking about,"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"but this is not quite the same."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"- No, I know."
01:20:26;01:20:26;"- We talk about the dead so much,"
01:20:26;01:20:27;"we don't have to go into detail,"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"but obviously the TC pick"
01:20:29;01:20:32;"for the greatest American rock band is the dead."
01:20:32;01:20:33;"And there's something that I like about that,"
01:20:33;01:20:36;"as an American, where I'm just kind of like,"
01:20:36;01:20:39;"you know what, being an American is random."
01:20:39;01:20:40;"It's cool."
01:20:40;01:20:44;"It's a fraught, borderline (beep) up thing."
01:20:44;01:20:46;"It's bizarre."
01:20:46;01:20:47;"It's strange."
01:20:47;01:20:49;"You got to almost just laugh about it."
01:20:49;01:20:53;"We can't have a national band, an iconic national band,"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"like the Stones or like the Led Zepp,"
01:20:55;01:20:59;"that just summarizes an entire generation of our country."
01:20:59;01:21:01;"It's like, it's cool to think that,"
01:21:01;01:21:03;"well, I don't know, man, maybe the Grateful Dead,"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"maybe this band that barely had any hits"
01:21:05;01:21:08;"that just kind of traveled the country like vagabonds,"
01:21:08;01:21:11;"just jamming and playing deep dark music"
01:21:11;01:21:13;"and also goofy cowboy songs."
01:21:13;01:21:14;"There's something about that,"
01:21:14;01:21:17;"that I like in terms of our national identity."
01:21:17;01:21:18;"- Yeah."
01:21:18;01:21:19;"- Even though I love all these bands,"
01:21:19;01:21:22;"I like that the American band is the funny, weird one"
01:21:22;01:21:23;"that's hard to put your finger on."
01:21:23;01:21:27;"It's not like the slick, perfect rock band,"
01:21:27;01:21:28;"like the Rolling Stones,"
01:21:28;01:21:31;"who I don't mean their music's slick, but they're branded."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"- Can I just take a full circle"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"and read you part of the quote?"
01:21:34;01:21:37;"So when Jerry Garcia died in '95,"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"Bob Dylan issued a statement,"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"and there's this one sentence that I always loved."
01:21:41;01:21:43;"He says, ""There are a lot of spaces and advances"
01:21:43;01:21:46;"""between the Carter family, Buddy Holly,"
01:21:46;01:21:49;"""and say Ornette Coleman, a lot of universes,"
01:21:49;01:21:50;"""but Jerry filled them all"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"""without being a member of any school."""
01:21:52;01:21:53;"So it's kind of what you're saying."
01:21:53;01:21:55;"I mean, he's just sort of like,"
01:21:55;01:21:59;"they're like this vagabond group that bridge the divides"
01:21:59;01:22:03;"between all these different strains in American history."
01:22:03;01:22:05;"So beautiful statement from Bob."
01:22:05;01:22:07;"- Yeah, actually it's funny."
01:22:07;01:22:08;"Somebody else showed me that recently."
01:22:08;01:22:10;"Just like, I love that Bob Dylan."
01:22:10;01:22:12;"Also recently, rest in peace, Little Richard."
01:22:12;01:22:15;"Bob Dylan also came out of the woodwork"
01:22:15;01:22:17;"to issue an actual statement on Twitter,"
01:22:17;01:22:18;"which is kind of rare for him,"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"where he talked about how everything comes"
01:22:20;01:22:21;"from Little Richard."
01:22:21;01:22:24;"He invented rock and roll and why he was so special."
01:22:24;01:22:27;"I love that for a handful of special people,"
01:22:27;01:22:29;"he'll come out and eulogize them."
01:22:29;01:22:30;"- Yep."
01:22:30;01:22:32;"- Speaking of American rock bands,"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"we promised we'd get into some of these"
01:22:34;01:22:36;"father of the bride emails."
01:22:36;01:22:37;"Let's crack a few open."
01:22:37;01:22:41;"- Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
01:22:41;01:22:42;"- One thing that I didn't say last week,"
01:22:42;01:22:45;"which was the actual anniversary week,"
01:22:45;01:22:47;"because we were kind of caught up talking with Steven"
01:22:47;01:22:50;"and was kind of thinking a lot about what fourth albums mean"
01:22:50;01:22:53;"and thinking about what's coming next,"
01:22:53;01:22:56;"'cause obviously spending a lot of time at home,"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"I can't help but think about what the next album"
01:22:58;01:23:01;"might be like and what the world's gonna look like."
01:23:01;01:23:03;"Will there be touring anytime soon?"
01:23:03;01:23:04;"I hope so."
01:23:04;01:23:06;"But anyway, the first thing I wanna say is,"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"obviously to the fans,"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"thank you for supporting father of the bride,"
01:23:10;01:23:13;"'cause whatever we could say about it,"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"and this is something I talked about with CT and Bayo too,"
01:23:15;01:23:17;"and we look back on all the touring and stuff"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"we did last year, even though it's a bummer,"
01:23:19;01:23:21;"we had to cancel a bunch this year,"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"it really exceeded our wildest expectations."
01:23:23;01:23:26;"I was kind of saying it last week,"
01:23:26;01:23:27;"fourth albums are very difficult"
01:23:27;01:23:30;"'cause they're pivot points for everybody,"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"any good band, I think it's some type of pivot point."
01:23:32;01:23:35;"And then for us, it just turned into this even bigger thing"
01:23:35;01:23:36;"with the years passing,"
01:23:36;01:23:39;"it's even more weight on this pivot point"
01:23:39;01:23:42;"and to make an album that's kind of different and stuff."
01:23:42;01:23:45;"I gotta say to everybody who came to the shows,"
01:23:45;01:23:47;"bought the album and stuff,"
01:23:47;01:23:49;"it does blow my mind a little bit,"
01:23:49;01:23:52;"the extent to which everything kind of worked."
01:23:52;01:23:55;"There's a hundred percent a version of this album"
01:23:55;01:23:58;"and album campaign that could have been"
01:23:58;01:24:01;"like the first 20 minutes of ""I'm Not There"","
01:24:01;01:24:04;"just excruciating, just brutal."
01:24:04;01:24:07;"And in some ways last year was like our best year ever"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"in terms of like the shows"
01:24:09;01:24:10;"and certain things that we accomplished."
01:24:10;01:24:13;"So anyway, as much as I'm kind of settling back"
01:24:13;01:24:18;"into the bad vibes of like thinking about the future"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"and worrying about what comes next,"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"I do have to take a moment just to be positive"
01:24:22;01:24:26;"and say like last year really was in almost every category,"
01:24:26;01:24:28;"like the best year for ""Vampire"" that we've had."
01:24:28;01:24:31;"So I gotta thank everybody for that,"
01:24:31;01:24:34;"everybody who supported it, the whole."
01:24:34;01:24:36;"And now you gotta thank ""Time Crisis"" too."
01:24:36;01:24:38;"As I said, Jake, Richard Pictures is influential,"
01:24:38;01:24:42;"but certain concepts that we discussed on the program,"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"I think also helped set a tone."
01:24:44;01:24:47;"- I'm honored just to be tangentially related."
01:24:47;01:24:50;"I think TCU helped expand the ""Vampire"" universe."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"They're two different universes,"
01:24:51;01:24:54;"but they intersect in a positive way"
01:24:54;01:24:56;"that I think made everything a little more interesting."
01:24:56;01:24:58;"Well, one thing that kind of makes me think"
01:24:58;01:25:00;"of ""Time Crisis"" and ""8 Minute Cape Cod"","
01:25:00;01:25:02;"this is one email about the bootleg community."
01:25:02;01:25:04;"And that's another thing I gotta say is like,"
01:25:04;01:25:09;"picturing this album coming back after six years,"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"what I thought were the two most likely scenarios"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"when a band comes back,"
01:25:13;01:25:16;"one is obviously the negative one that I talked about."
01:25:16;01:25:20;"People are just like, it's not the same, the moments passed."
01:25:20;01:25:24;"And of course, the longer that time passes,"
01:25:24;01:25:27;"some listeners are gonna compare an album"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"as soon as they hear it to, in our case,"
01:25:29;01:25:32;"literally 10 years of memories"
01:25:32;01:25:34;"that they have with these other albums."
01:25:34;01:25:35;"And suddenly, I know people,"
01:25:35;01:25:38;"everybody's like a free thinker and whatever,"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"but I just know how it works with audiences."
01:25:40;01:25:42;"And I know how I am as a listener."
01:25:42;01:25:44;"Sometimes you like one record"
01:25:44;01:25:46;"and then another one comes out way later"
01:25:46;01:25:48;"and you expect the same feeling"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"and it doesn't give you the same feeling."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"And it might be because the music's different."
01:25:52;01:25:54;"It also might be because the last record came out"
01:25:54;01:25:58;"when you were having a good year, you were in high school."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"You know, just so much changes."
01:26:00;01:26:03;"And obviously, you don't just hear music with your ears."
01:26:03;01:26:07;"It's teed up in a way based on your relationship"
01:26:07;01:26:10;"to music in general and to the band and to your own life."
01:26:10;01:26:13;"So the worst version was the album just kind of comes out"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"and just kind of like fizzles out immediately."
01:26:15;01:26:17;"Nobody cares that much."
01:26:17;01:26:21;"Maybe after the first song comes out, excitement dims."
01:26:21;01:26:23;"And it's kind of like a commercial disappointment."
01:26:23;01:26:26;"But then there's like another type of album."
01:26:26;01:26:27;"And I don't think we made this album,"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"but there's another type of album that could come out"
01:26:29;01:26:32;"where people are like very respectful."
01:26:32;01:26:34;"Nobody fights about it."
01:26:34;01:26:36;"All the fans are like, ""Hell yeah, the boys are back."
01:26:36;01:26:39;"""Sounds like the band we remember."""
01:26:39;01:26:41;"And yet that fizzles out very quickly too."
01:26:41;01:26:44;"And I'm not naming names, but I, you know,"
01:26:44;01:26:46;"I feel like every year you look at all the albums"
01:26:46;01:26:50;"that get like the top 20 albums that get critical claim"
01:26:50;01:26:53;"or, you know, nominated for this and that."
01:26:53;01:26:55;"And there's always a few that like"
01:26:55;01:26:56;"are on some different (beep)"
01:26:56;01:26:58;"And then there's a few that are kind of just like"
01:26:58;01:27:02;"respectfully spinning their wheels, you know,"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"and those fizzle out quickly."
01:27:04;01:27:08;"So anyway, because it gets harder to read the tea leaves,"
01:27:08;01:27:09;"you know, when you've been gone for a while,"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"I was always like very interested about like,"
01:27:11;01:27:15;"can this album not just like feel like a special moment"
01:27:15;01:27:18;"to me and to the band and to the fans"
01:27:18;01:27:20;"and not just be like a good album."
01:27:20;01:27:22;"Can it actually represent a new era in any way"
01:27:22;01:27:25;"that makes this whole project feel like exciting?"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"And I got to say that like the growth"
01:27:27;01:27:31;"of the bootleg community and the kind of live thing,"
01:27:31;01:27:34;"it really paid off in ways that I kind of"
01:27:34;01:27:35;"could have only hoped for."
01:27:35;01:27:36;"And that's all due to, you know,"
01:27:36;01:27:39;"people like from the freezer and suck a dog (beep)"
01:27:39;01:27:42;"I don't know if they identify suck a dog (beep)"
01:27:42;01:27:44;"I think their Instagram is suckadog(beep)2000,"
01:27:44;01:27:49;"but this person maintains a online bootleg community"
01:27:49;01:27:52;"where I don't even know how they have half of these shows."
01:27:52;01:27:54;"'Cause obviously Vampire Weekend's"
01:27:54;01:27:55;"never had like a taping scene,"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"but they have shows going all the way back"
01:27:57;01:27:58;"to the early days."
01:27:58;01:28:00;"And they even sometimes put together like"
01:28:00;01:28:03;"their own kind of dick specs of like their favorite things."
01:28:03;01:28:06;"So anyway, we got this email from Samuel Colson"
01:28:06;01:28:07;"saying hi, Ezra Crisis Crew."
01:28:07;01:28:09;"As part of the FOTB year in review,"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"I wondered if you'd touch on suckadog(beep)"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"in the VW bootleg community."
01:28:13;01:28:16;"As band is jamming much more live these days,"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"I believe it becomes more important"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"to capture each performance."
01:28:19;01:28:20;"That's true."
01:28:20;01:28:22;"I still don't think we're a true jam band,"
01:28:22;01:28:26;"but absolutely every show is different now."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"And the set lists are different."
01:28:27;01:28:30;"And often there's different performances of songs"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"that take on different characters."
01:28:32;01:28:33;"I went to Glastonbury last year"
01:28:33;01:28:34;"and was waiting out in the morning sun"
01:28:34;01:28:36;"for your secret set on the park stage,"
01:28:36;01:28:40;"full TC long sleeve tee on in 32 degrees Celsius"
01:28:40;01:28:41;"is quite something."
01:28:41;01:28:43;"32 degrees Celsius, that's like 90 something Fahrenheit,"
01:28:43;01:28:44;"right?"
01:28:44;01:28:46;"That's actually a number crunch."
01:28:46;01:28:47;"- Yeah."
01:28:47;01:28:49;"- What's 32 degrees Celsius?"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"- It's 89.6 Fahrenheit."
01:28:50;01:28:52;"- Dude, you nailed that."
01:28:52;01:28:53;"- So I got there at about 8 a.m."
01:28:53;01:28:54;"and hung out with some other VW heads"
01:28:54;01:28:56;"right at the barrier for the set."
01:28:56;01:28:59;"That was pretty tight to like come out for our secret show."
01:28:59;01:29:02;"Early morning, Glastonbury, I'm like the small stage."
01:29:02;01:29:05;"I feel like I remember seeing somebody in a TC long sleeve,"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"the Ezra and Jake one,"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"and just being like, oh, tight."
01:29:09;01:29:11;"It was the highlight of the festival for sure,"
01:29:11;01:29:12;"especially given the requests,"
01:29:12;01:29:16;"Giant Hannah Hunt and other deep cuts being played."
01:29:16;01:29:17;"In the almost year since that gig,"
01:29:17;01:29:18;"I've kept coming back to something"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"I heard your sound crew say,"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"that each gig was being recorded for the band to listen to"
01:29:22;01:29:23;"and make adjustments where needed."
01:29:23;01:29:24;"That's true."
01:29:24;01:29:26;"While I understand they won't be fully mixed shows,"
01:29:26;01:29:27;"just the PA mix,"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"will you ever release any of these tapes?"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"We're actually kind of like tracking down"
01:29:31;01:29:32;"all the hard drives now,"
01:29:32;01:29:37;"'cause they're all like all over the world."
01:29:37;01:29:39;"For those of us at the gigs that weren't recorded,"
01:29:39;01:29:40;"very little footage exists."
01:29:40;01:29:42;"Getting our hands on them would be akin"
01:29:42;01:29:45;"to getting some chunky donkeys for a hardcore Ben and Jerry set."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"Like LeBron James, by the way,"
01:29:47;01:29:50;"he posted that he has the chunky donkeys."
01:29:50;01:29:51;"In these times of crisis,"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"we could all do with some new VW live audio"
01:29:53;01:29:54;"or we can get it."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"What about the bootleggers, man?"
01:29:56;01:29:57;"All the best and looking forward"
01:29:57;01:29:58;"to whatever comes next, Sam."
01:29:58;01:30:01;"Because the live album,"
01:30:01;01:30:03;"in some ways feels like such a big deal"
01:30:03;01:30:06;"when you consider like all the iconic live albums"
01:30:06;01:30:07;"through history,"
01:30:07;01:30:10;"Stop Making Sense, Europe 72,"
01:30:10;01:30:11;"things of that nature."
01:30:11;01:30:14;"Maybe I'm like putting too much emphasis on it."
01:30:14;01:30:16;"We just got to start just like making (beep) available."
01:30:16;01:30:18;"It doesn't have to be some grand statement"
01:30:18;01:30:23;"of like digging through the best to create something."
01:30:23;01:30:24;"But yeah, no, of course we got to go through that"
01:30:24;01:30:27;"and we'll start putting stuff out here and there."
01:30:27;01:30:30;"One of these guys is going to turn into your Dick Latvala."
01:30:30;01:30:32;"- Well, that's basically the guy who runs Suck A Dog (beep)"
01:30:32;01:30:34;"- Okay, he's the Dick Latvala."
01:30:34;01:30:36;"- I think he made like a podcast or something"
01:30:36;01:30:40;"where he's like essentially putting his Dick's pics out"
01:30:40;01:30:41;"in a podcast form."
01:30:41;01:30:43;"- Is that why he calls it Suck A Dog (beep)"
01:30:43;01:30:46;"which by the way is an insane name."
01:30:46;01:30:48;"And every time we say it on this show,"
01:30:48;01:30:49;"it'll be bleeped out."
01:30:49;01:30:51;"- Well, Suck A Dog (beep) was like an inside joke"
01:30:51;01:30:53;"in Vampire Weekend in the early days."
01:30:53;01:30:54;"- Oh, this is news to me."
01:30:54;01:30:56;"- Me and Baya would like text it to each other."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"And it definitely comes from like,"
01:30:58;01:31:01;"I'm sure it comes from some like early 2000s"
01:31:01;01:31:02;"like internet comedy."
01:31:02;01:31:03;"That's what it sounds like."
01:31:03;01:31:05;"Like I can picture that being like a joke"
01:31:05;01:31:08;"in like a Stella short or something like that."
01:31:08;01:31:09;"It's like saying go (beep) yourself."
01:31:09;01:31:11;"It doesn't make any sense, you know."
01:31:11;01:31:13;"- But like, it's a funny coincidence"
01:31:13;01:31:16;"that Suck A Dog (beep) has a residence with Dick's pics."
01:31:16;01:31:18;"- It is a funny coincidence."
01:31:18;01:31:20;"I mean, if we want to make it more family friendly,"
01:31:20;01:31:21;"maybe they could just start calling themselves"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"Dog Latvala."
01:31:23;01:31:23;"But like why?"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"It's a long story, man."
01:31:25;01:31:27;"Just the dog."
01:31:27;01:31:30;"If eventually it becomes too harsh for people,"
01:31:30;01:31:34;"I would encourage the bootleg to maybe just become the dog."
01:31:34;01:31:34;"I also like that."
01:31:34;01:31:38;"Just like, who is the absolute king"
01:31:38;01:31:41;"of the Vampire Weekend bootleg community?"
01:31:41;01:31:42;"It's the dog, man."
01:31:42;01:31:44;"You gotta go to the dog."
01:31:44;01:31:45;"The dog has what you need."
01:31:45;01:31:48;"So anyway, I recommend that as a family friendly version."

01:32:29;01:32:31;"of Vampire Weekend bootleg audio."
01:32:31;01:32:33;"And then obviously the king of Vampire Weekend"
01:32:33;01:32:36;"bootleg merch is from The Freezer,"
01:32:36;01:32:38;"who everybody should follow on Instagram."
01:32:38;01:32:41;"And we got a question from Shana Chabrau about bootleg merch."
01:32:41;01:32:43;"Hi Ezra, I love how you've been encouraging fans"
01:32:43;01:32:46;"to make their own bootleg merch for the FOTB album cycle."
01:32:46;01:32:48;"It seems like that's normally something an artist"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"wouldn't encourage since that's where much"
01:32:50;01:32:51;"of their income can come from."
01:32:51;01:32:53;"Okay, but keep in mind Shana,"
01:32:53;01:32:56;"that was also back when we did live concerts."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"So we used to make income from other things."
01:32:58;01:33:00;"So I'm interested to know why that's something"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"you've been in favor of the past year."
01:33:02;01:33:04;"Here's the truth is that we come from like"
01:33:04;01:33:08;"the Napster generation where even our records,"
01:33:08;01:33:11;"we've been always being kind of like,"
01:33:11;01:33:13;"well, maybe we'll have an interesting career."
01:33:13;01:33:15;"We probably won't sell any albums."
01:33:15;01:33:17;"And then it's been amazing that we have,"
01:33:17;01:33:18;"but it's like, of course,"
01:33:18;01:33:20;"not like if we were banned from the 90s."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"So we've always had that vibe of kind of like,"
01:33:22;01:33:25;"you know what, anybody who's a fan of your band,"
01:33:25;01:33:28;"whether they listen to your music for free."
01:33:28;01:33:31;"And now I think the analog is make a shirt"
01:33:31;01:33:33;"and they make a little money selling stuff."
01:33:33;01:33:34;"They're flying the flag, man."
01:33:34;01:33:36;"You know, it's like so obvious at this point."
01:33:36;01:33:37;"- Totally."
01:33:37;01:33:40;"- Even though merch is like a bigger piece of the pie"
01:33:40;01:33:42;"and more of an important tent pole than ever."
01:33:42;01:33:45;"I really believe that first of all,"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"anybody who's really invested in the fan community."
01:33:47;01:33:48;"And I think a few people,"
01:33:48;01:33:52;"there's like a few bootleg shirt hits from the past year."
01:33:52;01:33:55;"Even like that time crisis shirt that we talk about."
01:33:55;01:33:57;"I see these a bunch like all over the place."
01:33:57;01:34:00;"I'm sure nobody's like quitting their day job."
01:34:00;01:34:01;"There's that,"
01:34:01;01:34:01;"and there's the person who made that"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"Sonic says no to racism,"
01:34:03;01:34:04;"which by the way,"
01:34:04;01:34:06;"it's a shirt we couldn't have even made if we wanted to."
01:34:06;01:34:08;"If somebody who's really invested"
01:34:08;01:34:10;"in like helping build a sense of community"
01:34:10;01:34:12;"within our fan base,"
01:34:12;01:34:13;"makes a little bit of money"
01:34:13;01:34:16;"because they created like a cool shirt"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"that a lot of a bunch of people want to buy."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"That's fair play."
01:34:19;01:34:20;"Like that's how it should be."
01:34:20;01:34:21;"You know what I mean?"
01:34:21;01:34:22;"- Yeah."
01:34:22;01:34:23;"- Because not only are they contributing to the fan base"
01:34:23;01:34:24;"and making people happy,"
01:34:24;01:34:27;"sometimes they're gonna make cooler than we do."
01:34:27;01:34:29;"And it's like,"
01:34:29;01:34:30;"that's great."
01:34:30;01:34:30;"So yeah,"
01:34:30;01:34:31;"it's to me,"
01:34:31;01:34:32;"it's like a no brainer."
01:34:32;01:34:33;"And in fact,"
01:34:33;01:34:34;"if anything,"
01:34:34;01:34:36;"I'm just happy that it's happened"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"because you can totally imagine too,"
01:34:38;01:34:41;"like obviously this album,"
01:34:41;01:34:44;"there's elements of it that veer towards the jammy direction"
01:34:44;01:34:45;"to live show."
01:34:45;01:34:47;"We stretch things out a little bit."
01:34:47;01:34:50;"It's all kind of like fun stuff that we enjoy"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"and that I think is cool."
01:34:52;01:34:53;"But just cause you do that stuff,"
01:34:53;01:34:57;"doesn't mean that your fan base"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"or your bootleg scene"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"is gonna become any more interesting."
01:35:01;01:35:02;"So I gotta say,"
01:35:02;01:35:03;"I'm like very happy with that."
01:35:03;01:35:04;"And we also had an interesting email."
01:35:04;01:35:05;"I don't have them all on deck,"
01:35:05;01:35:08;"but somebody was asking about the relationship"
01:35:08;01:35:10;"with graphic design."
01:35:10;01:35:11;"And that's worth talking about"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"because I wanna shout out some of the people"
01:35:13;01:35:14;"that I worked with on that."
01:35:14;01:35:16;"So, you know,"
01:35:16;01:35:17;"like with Vampire Weekend,"
01:35:17;01:35:21;"most of the big ideas come from within the core group."
01:35:21;01:35:22;"And with this album,"
01:35:22;01:35:24;"like I always had a vague sense of kind of like"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"the mood board and the types of images,"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"but I was working with this guy, Nick Hardwood,"
01:35:28;01:35:32;"who's became kind of like creative director."
01:35:32;01:35:34;"Nick's just like cool as hell."
01:35:34;01:35:37;"And they just love to like talk about ideas and images"
01:35:37;01:35:38;"and what they represent."
01:35:38;01:35:41;"And one thing we'd always come back to is that like,"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"there was something about this album that felt like,"
01:35:43;01:35:46;"yeah, the cover had to be a very simple central image"
01:35:46;01:35:47;"like the earth,"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"but there was something about it being this double album"
01:35:49;01:35:52;"that had to have kind of like its own universe of symbols."
01:35:52;01:35:55;"And so then Nick went out and found this guy,"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"Brendan Ratzlaff,"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"based up in the Vancouver area,"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"and basically saw some of his work and said,"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"I feel like he'd come up with cool stuff."
01:36:03;01:36:05;"So we kind of gave him our mood board and we were like,"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"we want like frogs and snakes."
01:36:07;01:36:10;"Like the first single has this line about snakes"
01:36:10;01:36:12;"and we want some kind of crunchy stuff."
01:36:12;01:36:15;"And we want some kind of nature stuff"
01:36:15;01:36:16;"and some technology stuff,"
01:36:16;01:36:19;"like all this stuff that kind of felt like the mood board"
01:36:19;01:36:20;"of the album."
01:36:20;01:36:22;"And then he created this whole like world of glyphs"
01:36:22;01:36:25;"that were like exactly what I was looking for"
01:36:25;01:36:26;"and better than I could have hoped."
01:36:26;01:36:28;"And I especially got to shout him out"
01:36:28;01:36:30;"for just creating the snake logo."
01:36:30;01:36:31;"'Cause you know, it's like,"
01:36:31;01:36:32;"you can go to anybody and be like,"
01:36:32;01:36:34;"yeah, we're making this album."
01:36:34;01:36:35;"It's a little crunchy."
01:36:35;01:36:37;"There's a song about snakes."
01:36:37;01:36:38;"Can you make a snake logo?"
01:36:38;01:36:41;"And of course, spirals were already kind of on the mood board"
01:36:41;01:36:42;"but the way he combined it,"
01:36:42;01:36:43;"it just like,"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"that actually surprised me the degree to which"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"that became like a symbol of the album"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"and it still kind of pops up on stuff."
01:36:49;01:36:52;"Yeah, so really hats off to Nick and Brendan for that"
01:36:52;01:36:54;"because that's the type of thing that just like,"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"it's just durable, you know?"
01:36:56;01:36:59;"And like, that's another one of the things"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"I got to shout out some of the best bootleg merches."
01:37:01;01:37:04;"There's that person, Petrified Goods."
01:37:04;01:37:05;"They make all sorts of stuff"
01:37:05;01:37:10;"and they often do like band logos on Patagonia baggies,"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"like the shorts and fleeces."
01:37:12;01:37:14;"And they've done a lot with the snake."
01:37:14;01:37:16;"And there is something about like, you know,"
01:37:16;01:37:19;"if you just told me when I was like first kind of"
01:37:19;01:37:22;"mood boarding the album and working on Harmony Hall"
01:37:22;01:37:25;"that one day within our little fan community,"
01:37:25;01:37:27;"there'd be an iconic piece of bootleg merch"
01:37:27;01:37:29;"that was a snake logo,"
01:37:29;01:37:33;"a spiral snake logo on a pair of Patagonia shorts,"
01:37:33;01:37:34;"I would have been like amazed."
01:37:34;01:37:35;"I would have been like,"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"I couldn't have dreamed a more perfect thing."
01:37:37;01:37:40;"But the cool thing about it is that we didn't do that."
01:37:40;01:37:42;"We set some wheels in motion,"
01:37:42;01:37:44;"but having great graphic designers"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"and cool people who do their own thing,"
01:37:46;01:37:47;"that's what creates something like that."
01:37:47;01:37:49;"You know, just imagine if like,"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"if I actually wanted to be like,"
01:37:51;01:37:54;"we should sell Patagonia shorts with a snake logo"
01:37:54;01:37:56;"on our merch stand, it would just be like a headache."
01:37:56;01:37:57;"You know, it's like, it's way cooler"
01:37:57;01:38:00;"that it happened organically like this."
01:38:00;01:38:02;"- I have a feeling that like the snake logo"
01:38:02;01:38:05;"will like kind of like have legs beyond just"
01:38:05;01:38:10;"the friend of the bride, father of the bride album cycle."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"- That's kind of how it feels."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"- Yeah."
01:38:12;01:38:13;"- And it's funny too, because like,"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"part of the Vampire Weekend vibe is like,"
01:38:15;01:38:19;"you know, obviously we've always wanted to have very like"
01:38:19;01:38:22;"striking album covers, starting with the first one,"
01:38:22;01:38:25;"just like, it felt kind of bold, but it's like,"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"when I first saw that picture of the chandelier,"
01:38:27;01:38:30;"this polaroid from a party we played, it's like, that's it."
01:38:30;01:38:31;"Although in a weird way,"
01:38:31;01:38:33;"I know that the father of the bride album cover"
01:38:33;01:38:36;"was divisive with some people,"
01:38:36;01:38:38;"but you also got to understand that like,"
01:38:38;01:38:41;"the boldness of like being the quote unquote preppy band"
01:38:41;01:38:44;"in the early days and just putting straight up a chandelier"
01:38:44;01:38:48;"on the cover, I love the extent to which that was kind of"
01:38:48;01:38:51;"like bold and simple and divisive."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"And that's kind of a cool vibe, the Polaroid,"
01:38:53;01:38:57;"and this album being like the austere white digital earth"
01:38:57;01:39:00;"is a very different vibe, but in a weird way,"
01:39:00;01:39:01;"I saw a connection."
01:39:01;01:39:02;"- Interesting."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"- And I actually feel like there needs to be a connection"
01:39:04;01:39:05;"between a first and a fourth album,"
01:39:05;01:39:08;"because the fourth album is beginning a new era"
01:39:08;01:39:09;"one way or another."
01:39:09;01:39:12;"I just knew that there was like something,"
01:39:12;01:39:13;"a lot of the preppy imagery,"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"as much as some people loved it,"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"there was something like uncomfortable about it to people"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"because they were like, what's this about?"
01:39:19;01:39:21;"Is this a joke?"
01:39:21;01:39:22;"What does this represent?"
01:39:22;01:39:24;"And there was something about the simplicity of the earth"
01:39:24;01:39:27;"that almost had the same energy in a very different way."
01:39:27;01:39:30;"But that's why, even though like I had the strong feeling"
01:39:30;01:39:33;"that it might like annoy some people,"
01:39:33;01:39:36;"I was like, there's something iconic about it."
01:39:36;01:39:37;"And I also got to shout out Nick too,"
01:39:37;01:39:40;"that to me, the saving grace of the album cover,"
01:39:40;01:39:44;"even if you hate the simple earth"
01:39:44;01:39:47;"and you don't like the kind of 90s graphic design text"
01:39:47;01:39:51;"going around, to me, what really saves that album"
01:39:51;01:39:53;"and makes it special is that simple orange stripe"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"on the side."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"And that was like, it just didn't feel finished."
01:39:57;01:39:59;"And we were kind of messing around"
01:39:59;01:40:01;"and Nick pulled out the orange stripe."
01:40:01;01:40:02;"That truly is the album cover."
01:40:02;01:40:03;"It's not just the earth,"
01:40:03;01:40:05;"it's this orange stripe plus the earth."
01:40:05;01:40:06;"That's like the image."
01:40:06;01:40:07;"- Yeah."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"- This album compared to our first three,"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"which are analog old pictures"
01:40:11;01:40:14;"that have warmth and depth and noise and stuff,"
01:40:14;01:40:15;"this has none of that."
01:40:15;01:40:17;"And I really wrestled with it."
01:40:17;01:40:19;"There's like alternate versions"
01:40:19;01:40:22;"where I found like vibey old pictures."
01:40:22;01:40:24;"It didn't feel like fourth album material."
01:40:24;01:40:28;"It didn't feel like rising to the challenge"
01:40:28;01:40:29;"of like opening up some new (beep)"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"We also got a bunch of emails,"
01:40:31;01:40:35;"which I appreciated about Lord Ullen's daughter,"
01:40:35;01:40:39;"which was one of the Japanese bonus tracks."
01:40:39;01:40:40;"Bowen Lee asked,"
01:40:40;01:40:41;"""Could you please walk us through the genesis"
01:40:41;01:40:42;"of Lord Ullen's daughter?"
01:40:42;01:40:43;"What drew you to the poem?"
01:40:43;01:40:46;"Did the Jude Law audio exist prior to the song?"
01:40:46;01:40:47;"Would you consider it a song?"""
01:40:47;01:40:50;"The poem, Lord Ullen's daughter,"
01:40:50;01:40:51;"I thought about it a lot"
01:40:51;01:40:54;"when I was working on Father of the Bride and writing it,"
01:40:54;01:40:57;"because I had some vague memory from college"
01:40:57;01:40:58;"or high school or something,"
01:40:58;01:41:01;"that there was like a classic old poem"
01:41:01;01:41:04;"that had a line about my Bonnie bride."
01:41:04;01:41:05;"Then I looked it up and found,"
01:41:05;01:41:08;"""Oh, it's this kind of famous Scottish poem."""
01:41:08;01:41:10;"And so I kind of, for a long time,"
01:41:10;01:41:13;"I was like, ""I want to quote this poem on the album,"""
01:41:13;01:41:18;"because the poem is essentially about a couple eloping."
01:41:18;01:41:21;"And the woman is the daughter of some big Highland chief."
01:41:21;01:41:22;"And for some reason,"
01:41:22;01:41:25;"he's mad that she's running off with this guy."
01:41:25;01:41:28;"And basically this young couple in love is like,"
01:41:28;01:41:29;"""We got to get out of here,"
01:41:29;01:41:34;"because if her father finds us with all his guys,"
01:41:34;01:41:36;"he's going to murder us."""
01:41:36;01:41:37;"So it's this kind of tense poem"
01:41:37;01:41:39;"where they're trying to get away."
01:41:39;01:41:42;"And then they roll up to a stormy sea"
01:41:42;01:41:43;"and there's the boat man."
01:41:43;01:41:47;"And the guy's like, ""Guys, the chop is out of control."
01:41:47;01:41:50;"I cannot take you on this boat in good conscience."""
01:41:50;01:41:54;"And the guy's like, ""Listen, man, we're in big trouble."
01:41:54;01:41:57;"If we stay here, in about 10 minutes,"
01:41:57;01:42:00;"her dad and all his shooters are going to run over here"
01:42:00;01:42:01;"and kill us."
01:42:01;01:42:02;"Here's a whole bunch of money."""
01:42:02;01:42:05;"And then the boatman says, ""You know what, man, I'll do it,"
01:42:05;01:42:07;"but not for your money."
01:42:07;01:42:10;"I'll do it because this is a very special lady."""
01:42:10;01:42:12;"And they get into the boat,"
01:42:12;01:42:14;"just in the nick of time, it's like a movie,"
01:42:14;01:42:16;"and they're pulling out into the water and it's real choppy."
01:42:16;01:42:19;"And then the father kind of comes barreling down"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"to the beach with all his guys."
01:42:21;01:42:23;"It's getting more and more (beep) up."
01:42:23;01:42:25;"And people are being like, ""Yo, turn back,"
01:42:25;01:42:26;"you can't make it."""
01:42:26;01:42:29;"And there's some line that's like,"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"""No, (beep) it, I'd rather face the waves"
01:42:31;01:42:33;"than face my psycho dad."""
01:42:33;01:42:36;"And they keep going off and off."
01:42:36;01:42:39;"And then the father who came down to the beach so angrily"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"with all his shooters, trying to grab these people,"
01:42:41;01:42:44;"grab the couple and probably murder the guy,"
01:42:44;01:42:48;"he gets down to the beach and sees the boat"
01:42:48;01:42:50;"going off into the distance."
01:42:50;01:42:53;"As the stormy seas take it down"
01:42:53;01:42:55;"and watches his daughter die."
01:42:55;01:42:58;"And there's this line about how he reached the fatal shore."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"And that line, the fatal shore,"
01:42:59;01:43:02;"it's like, there's like a famous book about Australia,"
01:43:02;01:43:04;"a history book that's called ""The Fatal Shore."""
01:43:04;01:43:07;"'Cause it is this like deep phrase, the fatal shore."
01:43:07;01:43:08;"It's like heavy."
01:43:08;01:43:10;"Where the land meets the sea, the fatal shore,"
01:43:10;01:43:14;"it's like this transition point and also like death."
01:43:14;01:43:17;"And so then it's almost like a King Midas story."
01:43:17;01:43:19;"It's like, you love something so much,"
01:43:19;01:43:22;"but your love turns into something kind of evil"
01:43:22;01:43:23;"and you actually kill it."
01:43:23;01:43:25;"He came down because he was so pissed,"
01:43:25;01:43:28;"ready to kill her new boyfriend."
01:43:28;01:43:31;"And then his anger and bad vibes send them out"
01:43:31;01:43:34;"into the ocean where he watches them die."
01:43:34;01:43:38;"Basically the poem ends with the father's wrath"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"turning to wailing."
01:43:40;01:43:42;"A guy who stormed down the beach so angry,"
01:43:42;01:43:44;"this macho controlling dad."
01:43:44;01:43:48;"And then his anger turns to tears"
01:43:48;01:43:50;"as he realizes what happened to his daughter."
01:43:50;01:43:52;"I was like, it's so heavy."
01:43:52;01:43:53;"I love the imagery of it."
01:43:53;01:43:57;"And I was like, this somehow ties into the themes"
01:43:57;01:43:58;"of this record."
01:43:58;01:44:00;"It ties into this like eerie figure,"
01:44:00;01:44:02;"the father of the bride."
01:44:02;01:44:07;"That like weird, heavy, masculine, macho anger of the past"
01:44:07;01:44:11;"that still exists and casts this long shadow."
01:44:11;01:44:15;"And that ultimately made me think of like the dying world."
01:44:15;01:44:18;"Modernization, things that are supposed to be good"
01:44:18;01:44:20;"that are actually killing the thing"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"that they were supposed to improve."
01:44:22;01:44:23;"Like that kind of weird mixed up."
01:44:23;01:44:25;"So I was like, this is a heavy poem."
01:44:25;01:44:28;"I love the fact that it has this bride imagery in it,"
01:44:28;01:44:29;"my Bonnie bride."
01:44:29;01:44:30;"I feel like it ties in."
01:44:30;01:44:32;"I feel like this poem actually kind of unlocked something"
01:44:32;01:44:34;"for me about the record."
01:44:34;01:44:36;"So when I first kind of wrote"
01:44:36;01:44:38;"the ""Big Blue Chord Progression,"""
01:44:38;01:44:42;"I kind of wanted to almost recite the poem over it."
01:44:42;01:44:43;"And that never felt quite right to me."
01:44:43;01:44:45;"And I kept toying with the ""Big Blue Chord Progression."""
01:44:45;01:44:47;"Eventually I just wanted to make that a simple short song."
01:44:47;01:44:49;"And I wrote, you know, ""Big Blue"" for once in my life,"
01:44:49;01:44:50;"I felt close to you."
01:44:50;01:44:52;"But I couldn't drop this idea"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"that there was something about that chord progression"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"in the poem that went together."
01:44:56;01:44:57;"So then when I'm thinking about"
01:44:57;01:44:59;"what could be a cool bonus track, I'm like,"
01:44:59;01:45:02;"oh, ""Lord Owen's Daughter"" over the ""Big Blue Chords,"""
01:45:02;01:45:04;"remix basically."
01:45:04;01:45:06;"And then I was like, should I read it?"
01:45:06;01:45:08;"And I was like, no, we should get somebody cool."
01:45:08;01:45:10;"And, you know, I've known Jude for a long time"
01:45:10;01:45:13;"and he did a voice on ""Neo Yokio"" and he's a great guy."
01:45:13;01:45:14;"I love him."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"And he's one of my favorite actors too."
01:45:16;01:45:18;"And I love his voice and his delivery."
01:45:18;01:45:21;"And so, you know, me and Ariel just like hit him up"
01:45:21;01:45:22;"and we're like, yo, would you read this poem?"
01:45:22;01:45:24;"And we sent him kind of a track"
01:45:24;01:45:25;"so he could kind of like do it in time."
01:45:25;01:45:28;"And he sent us the vocals back."
01:45:28;01:45:30;"I think he recorded it on his iPad and sent it back."
01:45:30;01:45:32;"And then we put it together."
01:45:32;01:45:34;"So anyway, it's not just like a kind of"
01:45:34;01:45:35;"thrown together random thing."
01:45:35;01:45:37;"It's like, it's very much connected to the record,"
01:45:37;01:45:40;"the poem and the chord progression."
01:45:40;01:45:43;"So it made a lot of sense to me as a bonus track."
01:45:43;01:45:46;"And also I knew that eventually we should release it"
01:45:46;01:45:48;"outside of Japan for the heads."

01:46:39;01:46:40;"- Sure."
01:46:40;01:46:42;"- I thought this was a really great email"
01:46:42;01:46:45;"and it totally made me rethink Big Blue."
01:46:45;01:46:48;"Hello TC Universe, Ezra said we could ask him"
01:46:48;01:46:50;"anything about FOTB."
01:46:50;01:46:52;"So my question is whether or not Big Blue"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"is about the Democratic Party."
01:46:54;01:46:57;"Did Ezra write this after the 2016 primaries?"
01:46:57;01:47:00;"Big Blue, for once in my life I felt close to you,"
01:47:00;01:47:02;"was finally they had a candidate like Bernie"
01:47:02;01:47:05;"that made him feel that they represented you."
01:47:05;01:47:09;"Then you offer protection, so am I learning my lesson"
01:47:09;01:47:12;"or am I back on my own, feeling that centrist Dems"
01:47:12;01:47:14;"were the only opposition to Trump in 2016?"
01:47:14;01:47:17;"I mean, it's kind of funny, but also wanting them"
01:47:17;01:47:20;"to earn your vote, facing the dilemma of voting Blue"
01:47:20;01:47:21;"no matter what."
01:47:21;01:47:24;"I just thought that was like a really cool reading"
01:47:24;01:47:27;"'cause I also was like, I also assumed Big Blue was like,"
01:47:27;01:47:30;"yeah, the ocean or the earth, but I know you"
01:47:30;01:47:33;"and I don't think of you as like a super outdoorsy guy"
01:47:33;01:47:37;"that feels like super connected to nature, you know?"
01:47:37;01:47:40;"There's been several attempts to have a TC camping episode."
01:47:40;01:47:44;"It's never happened and it's because of lack of enthusiasm"
01:47:44;01:47:47;"from the flagship of the brand here, Ezra."
01:47:47;01:47:51;"So I was just like, when I saw that email, I was like,"
01:47:51;01:47:55;"I don't know if that's it, but that resonates perfectly."
01:47:55;01:47:58;"Big Blue, for once in my life I felt close to you."
01:47:58;01:48:00;"And then also I was so overcome by emotion."
01:48:00;01:48:02;"No, I don't know if Bernie made you feel overcome"
01:48:02;01:48:06;"with emotion, but it actually, he did seem to like stir"
01:48:06;01:48:10;"something within you that no other candidate ever has."
01:48:10;01:48:11;"So anyway."
01:48:11;01:48:14;"- First of all, I'm down to camp."
01:48:14;01:48:15;"I'm interested in trying it."
01:48:15;01:48:18;"If I'm honest, this specific interpretation,"
01:48:18;01:48:21;"which I think is great about Big Blue"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"being the Democratic Party, and you finally felt close"
01:48:23;01:48:26;"to them in a really emotional way for a second,"
01:48:26;01:48:27;"but is it fleeting?"
01:48:27;01:48:29;"That never crossed my mind that specifically."
01:48:29;01:48:32;"But I think there's some truth to it in the sense"
01:48:32;01:48:36;"that obviously there's an environmental theme"
01:48:36;01:48:39;"on this record, but I think my style"
01:48:39;01:48:42;"and Vampire Weekend's style is that, you know,"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"a song has to earn its existence."
01:48:44;01:48:48;"And a song that basically just says like,"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"we love the earth, man, take care of your mother."
01:48:50;01:48:53;"That's not a Vampire Weekend song, you know?"
01:48:53;01:48:54;"And that to me is not what Big Blue is."
01:48:54;01:48:57;"Because to me, that's not interesting material for a song."
01:48:57;01:49:00;"Is to be like, the world's getting polluted,"
01:49:00;01:49:01;"take care of it."
01:49:01;01:49:04;"I think that's important material for like protest"
01:49:04;01:49:05;"and people to care about."
01:49:05;01:49:07;"I just don't think that's material for a song."
01:49:07;01:49:11;"So when I think of this song and I think about, you know,"
01:49:11;01:49:12;"why is it so short?"
01:49:12;01:49:13;"Even Arielle at times was like,"
01:49:13;01:49:16;"I think you should expand this into like a proper song."
01:49:16;01:49:18;"But you know, I wanted this album to have some vignettes."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"So what's the point of a vignette?"
01:49:20;01:49:25;"If anything, a vignette has to go a little deeper."
01:49:25;01:49:28;"It can't just be short and have like a stock statement,"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"just kind of like, take care of the earth, man."
01:49:30;01:49:32;"What I thought the song was about,"
01:49:32;01:49:35;"and similar to 2021 and the other short songs,"
01:49:35;01:49:39;"I was kind of like, this is about like this crucial"
01:49:39;01:49:42;"turning point moment where you feel close to something"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"bigger than yourself."
01:49:44;01:49:46;"And of course, to me, Big Blue connotes the earth."
01:49:46;01:49:49;"So, and I knew that that was kind of a theme of the record."
01:49:49;01:49:52;"So I thought about it in that way, but I also, you know,"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"I like things to have deeper meanings, not just one thing."
01:49:54;01:49:57;"So I was like, it's a moment of feeling deeply connected"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"to something in a way where you're literally overcome"
01:49:59;01:50:03;"by emotion, where you feel so deeply connected to it."
01:50:03;01:50:07;"But the song is not just about that feel good moment."
01:50:07;01:50:09;"It's about the eerie feeling that follows."
01:50:09;01:50:10;"But is that it?"
01:50:10;01:50:11;"Was it just a moment?"
01:50:11;01:50:14;"Because to me, that's like a facet of modern life."
01:50:14;01:50:17;"You get fired up about (beep) every day."
01:50:17;01:50:19;"You see something that moves you, disturbs you, whatever."
01:50:19;01:50:24;"And unfortunately, even these moments that feel pivotal,"
01:50:24;01:50:27;"there's something about modern life and maybe the internet,"
01:50:27;01:50:29;"I don't know, that just also makes it feel like"
01:50:29;01:50:31;"there's never stability."
01:50:31;01:50:32;"Like this (beep) just keeps coming at you."
01:50:32;01:50:34;"And what maybe when you were younger"
01:50:34;01:50:36;"and another moment of your life might've felt like"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"this big life-changing moment."
01:50:38;01:50:41;"Nowadays, you can't even always trust that feeling."
01:50:41;01:50:44;"It's almost like you're looking for that stable moment"
01:50:44;01:50:47;"to build off of and the deluge just keeps coming."
01:50:47;01:50:49;"So when I thought of Big Blue, I was like, all right,"
01:50:49;01:50:52;"there's the environmental theme of feeling close to nature"
01:50:52;01:50:54;"for a minute, but then watching it vanish."
01:50:54;01:50:57;"But also just like, if I get stuck on a phrase,"
01:50:57;01:50:59;"I wanna see what else people have done with it."
01:50:59;01:51:02;"And so I feel like when I Googled Big Blue,"
01:51:02;01:51:05;"one thing that came up was like IBM."
01:51:05;01:51:06;"And I was like, I love that."
01:51:06;01:51:08;"That like Big Blue can make you think of the ocean,"
01:51:08;01:51:12;"the earth, or just the big computer corporation."
01:51:12;01:51:14;"And also Big Blue is like University of Kentucky"
01:51:14;01:51:16;"or something, it's like sports teams."
01:51:16;01:51:19;"So I was like, as much as Big Blue intersects"
01:51:19;01:51:20;"with this environmental theme,"
01:51:20;01:51:22;"it also just represents something bigger than you."
01:51:22;01:51:25;"And also represents another facet of modern life,"
01:51:25;01:51:29;"which is like these brief moments of connectedness,"
01:51:29;01:51:32;"cosmic consciousness, being part of organizations"
01:51:32;01:51:33;"that are bigger than yourself,"
01:51:33;01:51:36;"and then watching it get kind of washed away"
01:51:36;01:51:37;"and you keep getting pushed back"
01:51:37;01:51:40;"to that kind of brutal American rugged individualism"
01:51:40;01:51:44;"or the kind of lonely individualism of like,"
01:51:44;01:51:48;"some people might say the neoliberal order or something."
01:51:48;01:51:50;"So in that sense, I did think of the song"
01:51:50;01:51:51;"as always being about that moment"
01:51:51;01:51:53;"where you feel connected to something big,"
01:51:53;01:51:55;"but then having that weird feeling,"
01:51:55;01:51:58;"is this gonna vanish just as quickly as it came?"
01:51:58;01:52:00;"I felt connected to something bigger for a moment."
01:52:00;01:52:04;"And then I watched as my faith or my enthusiasm"
01:52:04;01:52:08;"or my optimism just got overwhelmed by other things."
01:52:08;01:52:12;"So in that sense, comparing it to the Democratic Party,"
01:52:12;01:52:13;"there's absolutely something to that."
01:52:13;01:52:16;"And this is an interpretation I'll probably think about"
01:52:16;01:52:19;"for a long time, because obviously,"
01:52:19;01:52:22;"in the early days of writing ""Follow the Bride,"""
01:52:22;01:52:24;"I was like kind of fired up about the potential"
01:52:24;01:52:28;"that Bernie had to create a,"
01:52:28;01:52:29;"I've said this once or twice,"
01:52:29;01:52:31;"similar to seeing Richard Pictures,"
01:52:31;01:52:35;"I feel like when we did some of those 2016 Bernie rallies"
01:52:35;01:52:37;"and you looked out, I was like,"
01:52:37;01:52:40;"this is a more interesting, diverse crowd"
01:52:40;01:52:42;"full of people from different backgrounds"
01:52:42;01:52:44;"and different social milieus."
01:52:44;01:52:47;"When I picture playing in Washington Square Park"
01:52:47;01:52:48;"for the big Bernie rally,"
01:52:48;01:52:52;"there's all these electrical worker union guys up front,"
01:52:52;01:52:55;"still wearing their work clothes."
01:52:55;01:52:58;"Guys doing a real hard physical labor job."
01:52:58;01:53:00;"Of course, it's NYU."
01:53:00;01:53:02;"You have your kind of more like college students,"
01:53:02;01:53:05;"ivory tower types and everybody in between."
01:53:05;01:53:07;"And similar to seeing Richard Pictures"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"and being like, this is the first time I've seen people"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"just have a good vibe with a bunch of guitars"
01:53:11;01:53:12;"in a long time."
01:53:12;01:53:14;"I felt like looking at those crowds,"
01:53:14;01:53:16;"you're also like, this is like the first time"
01:53:16;01:53:18;"I've looked at a big crowd in a long time"
01:53:18;01:53:21;"and felt kind of almost what you hoped you might feel"
01:53:21;01:53:24;"at every kind of concert you go to."
01:53:24;01:53:26;"And I think most ""Vampire Weekend"" shows have some of that,"
01:53:26;01:53:27;"some shows more than others,"
01:53:27;01:53:29;"but to really look out at like a big crowd"
01:53:29;01:53:33;"and feel a sense of community, a sense of coalition,"
01:53:33;01:53:36;"a sense of like shared belief or something,"
01:53:36;01:53:38;"you don't always get that when you're at like"
01:53:38;01:53:40;"the Budweiser tent at the festival."
01:53:40;01:53:41;"Sometimes you do."
01:53:41;01:53:42;"I'm not saying corporate sponsorship"
01:53:42;01:53:44;"is necessarily the problem,"
01:53:44;01:53:47;"but I'm just saying sometimes concerts or festivals,"
01:53:47;01:53:51;"they feel more like Eurovision, a contest"
01:53:51;01:53:56;"versus like the kind of kind vibe, collective feeling."
01:53:56;01:53:58;"So again, that ties into ""Big Blue."""
01:53:58;01:54:01;"Are those moments something to grow and build on"
01:54:01;01:54:04;"or are they fleeting moments of beauty"
01:54:04;01:54:09;"with the Great Gatsby ceaselessly born back against,"
01:54:09;01:54:10;"(laughs)"
01:54:10;01:54:13;"the boat against the current ceaselessly born back?"
01:54:13;01:54:15;"Seinfeld, let me get a number crunch."
01:54:15;01:54:16;"What's the final line of ""Great Gatsby""?"
01:54:16;01:54:17;"- I wish I had that quote for you, bud."
01:54:17;01:54:19;"- Are you a ""Great Gatsby"" fan, Jake?"
01:54:19;01:54:21;"Did that mean anything to you?"
01:54:21;01:54:22;"Did you ever read that in high school or something?"
01:54:22;01:54:24;"- Yeah, I read it in high school."
01:54:24;01:54:25;"I should reread it."
01:54:25;01:54:29;"It's ""So We Beat On, Boats Against the Current,"
01:54:29;01:54:31;"Born Back Ceaselessly Into the Past."""
01:54:31;01:54:33;"- What I, first of all, reading books in high school sucks."
01:54:33;01:54:35;"It's so hard to connect with them."
01:54:35;01:54:36;"It really feels like a chore,"
01:54:36;01:54:39;"but I like ""The Great Gatsby"" 'cause I like the setting."
01:54:39;01:54:42;"I like that it mostly took place on Long Island."
01:54:42;01:54:44;"- It's tri-state. - Tri-state pride."
01:54:44;01:54:48;"But also, that really is a great American book."
01:54:48;01:54:50;"When I think of all the high school books"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"that Americans are forced to read,"
01:54:52;01:54:55;"that one speaks the most, I think, to modern America"
01:54:55;01:54:58;"in that it's funny, we're talking about ""The Grateful Dead"""
01:54:58;01:55:01;"and ""Flaming Lips"" and that American (beep)"
01:55:01;01:55:04;"always has a little bit of P.T. Barnum hucksterism."
01:55:04;01:55:06;"It's hard to just take it quite as seriously."
01:55:06;01:55:08;"But the character of ""The Great Gatsby,"""
01:55:08;01:55:09;"he's kind of a huckster too."
01:55:09;01:55:12;"This rich, kind of elegant guy whose background actually,"
01:55:12;01:55:15;"he's this weird self-made man who has connections"
01:55:15;01:55:18;"to organized crime and bootlegging and stuff."
01:55:18;01:55:21;"A lot of bootleg talk on this T.C."
01:55:21;01:55:23;"So anyway, no spoilers, but just the idea"
01:55:23;01:55:26;"that there's something about American life,"
01:55:26;01:55:29;"which in turn, you could say that whatever 1920s"
01:55:29;01:55:31;"American life represented back then,"
01:55:31;01:55:34;"maybe it seemed like this uniquely American phenomenon,"
01:55:34;01:55:37;"a certain type of flavor feeling"
01:55:37;01:55:40;"of kind of New World capitalism."
01:55:40;01:55:41;"Whatever was happening in 1920s America,"
01:55:41;01:55:44;"the whole world has a taste of it now,"
01:55:44;01:55:46;"arguably in late '20s. (laughs)"
01:55:46;01:55:48;"- I mean, and look who's president."
01:55:48;01:55:49;"- Yeah, seriously."
01:55:49;01:55:50;"The ultimate huckster."
01:55:50;01:55:54;"So America was on the forefront of something in the '20s."
01:55:54;01:55:58;"And anyway, this idea, this image of the boat"
01:55:58;01:55:59;"going against the current,"
01:55:59;01:56:02;"just always getting pushed back into the past,"
01:56:02;01:56:04;"there's something about that feeling of like,"
01:56:04;01:56:06;"I don't know if it's Americanism,"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"obviously, maybe it's played out,"
01:56:08;01:56:11;"but there's a reason people say it so much now."
01:56:11;01:56:12;"Maybe it's capitalism."
01:56:12;01:56:15;"This idea that always reaching for something"
01:56:15;01:56:19;"that's just out of reach, one step forward, two steps back."
01:56:19;01:56:20;"The boat going against the current,"
01:56:20;01:56:21;"always getting pushed back."
01:56:21;01:56:25;"Like, I'm sure many people have written high school essays"
01:56:25;01:56:27;"about what the current represents in that line."
01:56:27;01:56:30;"What is the thing that keeps pushing the boat back"
01:56:30;01:56:31;"in modern life?"
01:56:31;01:56:34;"What is that thing that keeps that green light"
01:56:34;01:56:35;"just out of reach?"
01:56:35;01:56:36;"But that's some real (beep)"
01:56:36;01:56:38;"and I think that's why that book"
01:56:38;01:56:41;"kind of like hauntingly prefigures"
01:56:41;01:56:44;"elements of the next hundred years of American life."
01:56:44;01:56:46;"- Give me tight."
01:56:46;01:56:46;"- Yeah."
01:56:46;01:56:48;"- TC Book Club."
01:56:48;01:56:49;"- Great Gatsby."
01:56:49;01:56:50;"We can do that."
01:56:50;01:56:51;"- I'm down."
01:56:51;01:56:53;"Just all high school books."
01:56:53;01:56:54;"- All high school books."
01:56:54;01:56:55;"- Catcher in the Rye."
01:56:55;01:56:56;"- Yeah, hell yeah."
01:56:56;01:56:58;"- Oh, Catcher in the Rye."
01:56:58;01:57:01;"Yeah, I feel like Great Gatsby kind of ultimately"
01:57:01;01:57:03;"is more interesting than Catcher in the Rye."
01:57:03;01:57:05;"Maybe that's sacrilegious to say."
01:57:05;01:57:06;"- No, I think that's real."

01:57:57;01:57:59;"We've just had so much to cover."
01:57:59;01:58:00;"I mean, on this episode alone,"
01:58:00;01:58:03;"we had Hank Azaria talking about a major moment"
01:58:03;01:58:06;"in the classic rock discourse."
01:58:06;01:58:07;"We had Red Lobster."
01:58:07;01:58:09;"We had more FOTB to get to."

01:58:12;01:58:15;"It just gets a little bit harder to pull off."
01:58:15;01:58:16;"I don't know why."
01:58:16;01:58:18;"It's just harder when we do it on FaceTime."
01:58:18;01:58:19;"- Yeah, I think there's a different rhythm"
01:58:19;01:58:21;"to these FaceTime shows."
01:58:21;01:58:22;"- Yeah."
01:58:22;01:58:24;"- We've had top fives planned the last three"
01:58:24;01:58:27;"or four episodes, and I've seen a few people on Twitter"
01:58:27;01:58:30;"being like, ""Guys, please do a top five."
01:58:30;01:58:31;"""I miss it."""
01:58:31;01:58:33;"So just to let the listeners know,"
01:58:33;01:58:36;"we're trying our darndest to get to them."
01:58:36;01:58:37;"- We will bring back the top five"
01:58:37;01:58:39;"in these strange and uncertain times."
01:58:39;01:58:40;"We hear you."
01:58:40;01:58:42;"But anyway, before we go out,"
01:58:42;01:58:47;"obviously so many iconic people have been lost lately."
01:58:47;01:58:51;"It's hard to actually stay on top of all them."
01:58:51;01:58:54;"Seinfeld, we would be remiss not to have you"
01:58:54;01:58:56;"give a special shout out to a true legend"
01:58:56;01:58:58;"from the Seinfeld universe, Jerry Stiller,"
01:58:58;01:59:00;"who passed away this past week."
01:59:00;01:59:02;"- Yeah, speaking of top five,"
01:59:02;01:59:04;"I would say that Frank Costanza"
01:59:04;01:59:07;"is a top five Seinfeld character."
01:59:07;01:59:09;"And Jerry Stiller, as you said,"
01:59:09;01:59:12;"passed away a few days ago at the age of 92."
01:59:12;01:59:13;"I did a bit of a deep dive,"
01:59:13;01:59:16;"and Frank Costanza,"
01:59:16;01:59:19;"Jerry Stiller wasn't the first Frank Costanza."
01:59:19;01:59:22;"Originally, Frank Costanza was played by an actor"
01:59:22;01:59:23;"named John Randolph,"
01:59:23;01:59:26;"and his scene was reshot for syndication."
01:59:26;01:59:28;"- Meaning that when Seinfeld aired,"
01:59:28;01:59:31;"there was one episode where a different actor"
01:59:31;01:59:33;"played Frank Costanza, and it aired,"
01:59:33;01:59:36;"but then they cut him out of the history books."
01:59:36;01:59:38;"That scene is a real Seinfeld grail."
01:59:38;01:59:39;"- That's correct, yeah."
01:59:39;01:59:40;"And there's a YouTube video"
01:59:40;01:59:44;"where they do a split screen of the original Frank Costanza"
01:59:44;01:59:46;"and Jerry Stiller's Frank Costanza."
01:59:46;01:59:50;"And I mean, of course, Jerry Stiller just kills it."
01:59:50;01:59:52;"But also, what's remarkable about that scene"
01:59:52;01:59:55;"is that Jason Alexander is just like,"
01:59:55;01:59:58;"it just shows you what an incredible performer he is"
01:59:58;02:00:00;"because he's just like clockwork."
02:00:00;02:00:03;"Like he does the exact same scene exactly as he did it,"
02:00:03;02:00:06;"I guess they'd shot it a couple of years before."
02:00:06;02:00:09;"Jerry Stiller told Esquire in 2005,"
02:00:09;02:00:11;"""I was out of work at the time."
02:00:11;02:00:12;"""My manager had retired."
02:00:12;02:00:15;"""I was close to 70 years old and I had nowhere to go."
02:00:15;02:00:17;"""I get this chance on Seinfeld,"
02:00:17;02:00:19;"""I'd never even seen the show."
02:00:19;02:00:20;"""The idea was for Estelle Harris,"
02:00:20;02:00:23;"""who was the screamer to be the boss lady"
02:00:23;02:00:24;"""of the Costanza family,"
02:00:24;02:00:28;"""and I was supposed to be her Thurber-esque husband."""
02:00:28;02:00:30;"What does he mean by that, Thurber-esque?"
02:00:30;02:00:31;"- Is Thurber a writer?"
02:00:31;02:00:35;"Oh, there's an American cartoonist, James Thurber."
02:00:35;02:00:36;"- Oh, okay. - An author,"
02:00:36;02:00:38;"cartoonist, humorist."
02:00:38;02:00:40;"Interestingly, he wrote the short story"
02:00:40;02:00:41;"""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,"""
02:00:41;02:00:43;"which Jerry's son, Ben-- - Damn."
02:00:43;02:00:46;"- Would make a film adaptation of."
02:00:46;02:00:48;"- He says, ""The part called for me to wear a bald wig"
02:00:48;02:00:51;"""and to look like George and act very meek."
02:00:51;02:00:52;"""But after a couple of days,"
02:00:52;02:00:54;"""I realized that acting meek was gonna get me fired"
02:00:54;02:00:56;"""just like the last guy."
02:00:56;02:00:57;"""On the fourth day, I said to Larry David,"
02:00:57;02:01:00;"""'This ain't working, can I do it my way?'"""
02:01:00;02:01:02;"So that character, Frankenstanza,"
02:01:02;02:01:05;"was a real late career resurgence for Jerry."
02:01:05;02:01:07;"He'd had like decades of a career"
02:01:07;02:01:11;"as part of the bickering husband and wife comedy duo"
02:01:11;02:01:13;"Stiller and Mira."
02:01:13;02:01:15;"And Jerry, interestingly,"
02:01:15;02:01:19;"was also like a TV commercial staple before,"
02:01:19;02:01:20;"but especially after ""Seinfeld."""
02:01:20;02:01:22;"It seemed like after ""Seinfeld"" came out,"
02:01:22;02:01:25;"everybody wanted that manic, frank, Kistanza energy."
02:01:25;02:01:27;"So there were a ton of commercials with Jerry Stiller."
02:01:27;02:01:29;"He did a commercial for Nike"
02:01:29;02:01:31;"where he played the late Vince Lombardi."
02:01:31;02:01:34;"He's in a Jack in the Box commercial."
02:01:34;02:01:36;"There's a Windex commercial with him."
02:01:36;02:01:41;"And there's a weird AOL commercial with Snoop Dogg in it."
02:01:41;02:01:43;"AT&T, Capital One."
02:01:43;02:01:44;"Like he was just like killing it."
02:01:44;02:01:45;"- Oh, everything."
02:01:45;02:01:48;"So ""Seinfeld"" really changed his whole career."
02:01:48;02:01:50;"- Yeah, 'cause in all these commercials post ""Seinfeld,"""
02:01:50;02:01:51;"he's basically Frank Kistanza."
02:01:51;02:01:53;"There are a couple that are actually"
02:01:53;02:01:55;"him and Estelle Harris together."
02:01:55;02:01:57;"- And he basically played Frank Kistanza"
02:01:57;02:01:59;"on ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" right?"
02:01:59;02:02:01;"- Yeah, yeah."
02:02:01;02:02:03;"He sort of played a bit of like"
02:02:03;02:02:06;"a watered down Frank Kistanza in my eyes."
02:02:06;02:02:08;"Like a little, he played the sort of like"
02:02:08;02:02:11;"through the lens of Kevin James, Frank Kistanza,"
02:02:11;02:02:13;"but it was pretty much the same character."
02:02:13;02:02:14;"- Oh no, he was on ""King of Queens,"""
02:02:14;02:02:16;"not ""Everybody Loves Raymond."""
02:02:16;02:02:17;"- Yeah, ""King of Queens."" - Oh, my bad."
02:02:17;02:02:17;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
02:02:17;02:02:19;"I heard that it's ""King of Queens"" too, but yeah."
02:02:19;02:02:20;"- I wonder what-"
02:02:20;02:02:21;"- I'm sorry, I just wanna know,"
02:02:21;02:02:24;"'cause I didn't know this before."
02:02:24;02:02:27;"It's one thing to sort of get typecast"
02:02:27;02:02:30;"as something that you sort of happened into."
02:02:30;02:02:34;"He went into a show that was already successful"
02:02:34;02:02:36;"and he created the character."
02:02:36;02:02:37;"- Right."
02:02:37;02:02:38;"- So the idea that he could take ownership"
02:02:38;02:02:43;"for that to be the MX guy or the whatever, that's amazing."
02:02:43;02:02:44;"- Right."
02:02:44;02:02:47;"He didn't just get lucky getting a great part written for him"
02:02:47;02:02:50;"and then he dines out on it for the rest of his life"
02:02:50;02:02:52;"being like, ""Oh yeah, I can be whoever."""
02:02:52;02:02:53;"He made it happen."
02:02:53;02:02:55;"- Yeah, that's a good point."
02:02:55;02:02:59;"You know, one thing that he was known for before ""Seinfeld"""
02:02:59;02:03:03;"was with Stiller and Mira in the '60s and '70s."
02:03:03;02:03:07;"They were sort of like this pitch man duo"
02:03:07;02:03:09;"for Blue Nun Wine."
02:03:09;02:03:10;"Do you guys know Blue Nun Wine?"
02:03:10;02:03:12;"- Blue Nun? - No."
02:03:12;02:03:15;"- Blue Nun, it's a German white wine brand."
02:03:15;02:03:18;"It still exists today, I was looking into it."
02:03:18;02:03:20;"- And they have a nun as their mascot?"
02:03:20;02:03:22;"- Yeah, a nun as their mascot."
02:03:22;02:03:23;"- Comes in a blue bottle."
02:03:23;02:03:26;"- Yeah, a blue bottle, but the wine is white."
02:03:26;02:03:30;"The wine was actually referenced on a friend of the show,"
02:03:30;02:03:33;"Beastie Boys, 1992 album, ""Check Your Head."""
02:03:33;02:03:35;"There's like a sketch. - Oh, really?"
02:03:35;02:03:37;"- Yeah, there's a sketch where they're like,"
02:03:37;02:03:42;"they're in the owner of Blue Wine's house or something."
02:03:42;02:03:44;"Anyway, according to the Chicago Tribune,"
02:03:44;02:03:45;"these commercials were so effective"
02:03:45;02:03:49;"that they boosted sales of Blue Nun Wine by 500%."
02:03:49;02:03:53;"So I found one of these Blue Nun Wine ads"
02:03:53;02:03:56;"and just thought it was like kind of a charming relic"
02:03:56;02:04:00;"from pre-Seinfeld, Jerry Stiller."
02:04:00;02:04:03;"So I thought we could give it a listen."
02:04:03;02:04:03;"- Excuse me, miss,"
02:04:03;02:04:06;"but you seem to be having trouble picking out a wine."
02:04:06;02:04:07;"Maybe I can help you."
02:04:07;02:04:09;"- Oh, I'm sorry, but I never talk to strangers."
02:04:09;02:04:11;"- Oh, how did you know?"
02:04:11;02:04:12;"- What do you mean, how did I know?"
02:04:12;02:04:13;"You're a stranger."
02:04:13;02:04:15;"- Right, Elliot Stranger."
02:04:15;02:04:16;"- Is that really your name?"
02:04:16;02:04:18;"- No, it's really Elliot Sverdlik,"
02:04:18;02:04:20;"but I do meet a lot of pretty girls this way."
02:04:20;02:04:21;"- I like you, Elliot."
02:04:21;02:04:24;"You're weird, but I like you."
02:04:24;02:04:25;"Maybe you can help."
02:04:25;02:04:27;"See, I'm having some friends over for smorgasbord,"
02:04:27;02:04:29;"some shrimps, a little cheese, some meatballs."
02:04:29;02:04:31;"What kind of wine can you serve with all those things?"
02:04:31;02:04:33;"- May I suggest you have a little Blue Nun"
02:04:33;02:04:35;"at your smorgasbord?"
02:04:35;02:04:36;"- Oh, I don't think she'd have a very good time."
02:04:36;02:04:38;"Besides, it's gonna be all couples."
02:04:38;02:04:40;"- Oh, no, Blue Nun wine."
02:04:40;02:04:43;"It's a delicious white wine that's correct with any dish."
02:04:43;02:04:45;"Meat, fish, cheese, meatballs."
02:04:45;02:04:46;"- Oh, Blue Nun."
02:04:46;02:04:48;"Elliot, you made me a convert."
02:04:48;02:04:50;"- I suppose you're gonna drink it religiously."
02:04:50;02:04:53;"- Yeah, it's gonna become a real habit."
02:04:53;02:04:55;"- Blue Nun, the delicious white wine"
02:04:55;02:04:57;"that's correct with any dish."
02:04:57;02:04:59;"Another Seychelles wine imported by Schefflin"
02:04:59;02:05:00;"and Company New York."
02:05:00;02:05:02;"- Diller and Mira, one of their running gags"
02:05:02;02:05:05;"was that he was Jewish and she was Catholic,"
02:05:05;02:05:07;"which I guess like in the Ed Sullivan era"
02:05:07;02:05:10;"was like an edgy dichotomy for two people."
02:05:10;02:05:12;"So it was kind of a callback to that."
02:05:12;02:05:15;"So I guess there was a lot of riffing in that Blue Nun ad."
02:05:15;02:05:18;"- That's what it is."
02:05:18;02:05:22;"I love just that old school New York humor,"
02:05:22;02:05:23;"just old school showbiz,"
02:05:23;02:05:26;"but it's actually like witty and funny."
02:05:26;02:05:28;"- I love when she says, ""You're weird."""
02:05:29;02:05:31;"- ""You're weird, I like you."""
02:05:31;02:05:34;"Well, RIP to the legend, Jerry Stiller."
02:05:34;02:05:36;"Condolences to the family."
02:05:36;02:05:39;"Thank you for all the joy you've brought us on Seinfeld"
02:05:39;02:05:41;"and so much else."
02:05:41;02:05:44;"This episode is dedicated to you."
02:05:44;02:05:45;"All right, everybody, we'll see you next time."
02:05:45;02:05:46;"Peace."
