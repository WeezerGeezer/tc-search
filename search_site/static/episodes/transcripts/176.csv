00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis back again"
00:02;00:05;"great food"
00:05;00:07;"classic rock"
00:07;00:10;"Does that tell the whole story of Elvis Presley hard to say?"
00:10;00:14;"But today we're gonna finally do a tribute"
00:14;00:17;"to the king"
00:17;00:19;"the king of rock"
00:19;00:21;"This is a very special"
00:21;00:24;"Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
00:24;00:26;"*music*"
00:31;00:33;"They passed me by"
00:33;00:37;"All of those great romances"
00:37;00:39;"They were a threat"
00:39;00:41;"Robbing me"
00:41;00:44;"Of my rightful chances"
00:44;00:46;"My picture clear"
00:46;00:51;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:51;00:55;"And so I dealt to the floor"
00:55;00:58;"When a bus had to go"
00:59;01:03;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:03;01:06;"One of us is crying"
01:06;01:09;"One of us is lying"
01:09;01:13;"We were only there"
01:13;01:15;"Time Crisis back again"
01:15;01:19;"With our 68th comeback special"
01:19;01:22;"We know that TC's been getting a little bit uh"
01:22;01:24;"esoteric lately"
01:24;01:26;"Fair"
01:26;01:28;"Some people want the music"
01:29;01:31;"They don't come for the tap water"
01:31;01:33;"They don't come for the pizza"
01:33;01:35;"They don't even come for the baked potatoes"
01:35;01:37;"They come for the music"
01:37;01:39;"Alright, how about Elvis Presley"
01:39;01:41;"How does that sound to everybody?"
01:41;01:43;"If you're one of those rock fans"
01:43;01:45;"Got into TC because"
01:45;01:50;"Because you love rock music and our commentary on it"
01:50;01:52;"Alright, let's go straight to the king"
01:52;01:54;"I gotta point out that today"
01:54;01:56;"We're blessedly in person"
01:56;02:00;"And Jake is wearing a Yardhouse t-shirt"
02:00;02:04;"And you've made passing reference to the Yardhouse on the show"
02:04;02:07;"But I feel like we've never like really explained it"
02:07;02:09;"And actually as I think about it"
02:09;02:11;"I only like half understand what Yardhouse is"
02:11;02:14;"Because I think I used to think it was only at one or two airports"
02:14;02:19;"But then I started to encounter them just like in various downtowns"
02:19;02:21;"Yardhouse is a big chain"
02:21;02:25;"It's like, it's kind of like an off-brand hard rock cafe"
02:25;02:28;"First of all, I love this intro"
02:28;02:30;"We're here to talk about music"
02:30;02:32;"And we're here to talk about Elvis Presley"
02:32;02:36;"But let's do a 45 minute tangent"
02:36;02:40;"On a basically glorified airport restaurant"
02:40;02:45;"Okay, but Yardhouse's famous tagline"
02:45;02:48;"Which I know Jake has quoted is ""Great food, classic rock"""
02:48;02:51;"So it's not a million miles away from Elvis Presley"
02:51;02:54;"Yeah, it's on brand"
02:54;02:56;"And I did a painting last year"
02:56;03:00;"Of just like the facade of the side of a Yardhouse"
03:00;03:03;"And it just had the text ""Great food, classic rock"""
03:03;03:05;"And also just to point out"
03:05;03:07;"Jake's wearing a kind of faded purple shirt"
03:07;03:09;"It's an oval"
03:09;03:10;"The top says ""Great food, classic rock"""
03:10;03:12;"In the middle in big letters says ""Yardhouse"""
03:12;03:16;"And on the bottom it says ""World's largest selection of draft beer"""
03:16;03:17;"Probably debatable"
03:17;03:19;"That's got to be a lot of draft beer"
03:19;03:21;"Yeah, well there was one"
03:21;03:23;"I used to go to the one occasionally in Pasadena"
03:23;03:25;"Which was adjacent to the Arclight"
03:25;03:27;"RIP to the Arclight"
03:27;03:29;"And you could go in there and get"
03:29;03:32;"Like mediocre nachos"
03:32;03:35;"After the movie for like $13.95"
03:35;03:40;"And drink one of those oversized airport sized beers"
03:40;03:42;"So was that your first experience with Yardhouse?"
03:42;03:43;"Yeah"
03:43;03:46;"And you were just hitting it because it was adjacent to the movie theater?"
03:46;03:48;"And because it said ""Great food, classic rock"""
03:48;03:51;"Okay, so it's always been ""Great food, classic rock"""
03:51;03:53;"So how does the..."
03:53;03:55;"Okay, so the ""Great food"" sounds obvious"
03:55;03:57;"Sounds like amazing nachos"
03:57;04:00;"The world's largest selection of draft beer, sure"
04:00;04:03;"How does the ""Classic rock"" play out in the environment?"
04:03;04:05;"Pretty liberal"
04:05;04:08;"I think they're liberal in the use of that term"
04:08;04:09;"I'll say this"
04:09;04:11;"You're going to hear ""Foo Fighters"""
04:11;04:12;"Okay"
04:12;04:14;"That ain't classic rock, folks"
04:14;04:19;"Classic rock, by my book, ended in about 1980"
04:19;04:22;"That's way too conservative for the modern world"
04:22;04:25;"Foo Fighters will be eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in a few years"
04:25;04:27;"They're not already?"
04:27;04:29;"Aren't they in?"
04:29;04:31;"I think they're in, dude"
04:31;04:35;"They're the only band that was allowed in underneath the limit"
04:35;04:38;"Yeah, they're going to make it in first ballot like Derek Jeter"
04:38;04:39;"Wait, they actually are in?"
04:39;04:40;"They're in"
04:40;04:41;"Oh, last year?"
04:41;04:46;"Wow, the foos beat out the random people that we said aren't in"
04:46;04:47;"Chili's?"
04:47;04:48;"No, the Chili's are in"
04:48;04:50;"Replacements? Not in"
04:50;04:51;"Rage"
04:51;04:55;"Alright, the Foo Fighters, classic rock group, Hall of Famers"
04:55;04:57;"Inducted by Sir Paul McCartney"
04:57;05:00;"Oh, okay, wow, missed that one"
05:00;05:05;"So, okay, they're playing great classic rock music"
05:05;05:08;"Is there memorabilia or artifacts, a la Hard Rock Cafe?"
05:08;05:09;"No"
05:09;05:12;"It's basically an airport bar"
05:12;05:17;"It's really, it has an enormous footprint"
05:17;05:21;"It's just massive, really high ceiling"
05:21;05:24;"Just a terrible vibe at the Yard House"
05:24;05:27;"Not a good restaurant, not a fun experience"
05:27;05:30;"Let's get a number crunch going, how many Yard Houses are there?"
05:30;05:32;"I've only been to the one in Pasadena, by the way"
05:32;05:34;"There's over 80"
05:34;05:35;"80?"
05:35;05:39;"It was founded in Long Beach in 1996"
05:39;05:41;"It is now at Darden"
05:41;05:45;"Oh, part of the Darden family"
05:45;05:47;"Welcome to the Darden family, Yard House"
05:47;05:49;"We've covered Darden extensively on the show"
05:49;05:52;"It's a great group, great group of restaurants"
05:52;05:59;"Started with the founding of Red Lobster in 1968 in Lakeland, Florida, if memory serves"
05:59;06:03;"There's really something about Yard House"
06:03;06:06;"The one thing that's truly disturbing about it is"
06:06;06:08;"And you described it very eloquently, Jake"
06:08;06:11;"It's basically just an airport restaurant"
06:11;06:14;"And I first saw one, I think, in an airport restaurant"
06:14;06:16;"And I assumed it was something that"
06:16;06:19;"Because in airports, you find over and over again"
06:19;06:25;"Literally the same lame food, just repackaged locally"
06:25;06:29;"You know, like, you could just totally picture being at the Phoenix airport"
06:29;06:34;"And you pass some place that has the same granola and yogurt for breakfast"
06:34;06:37;"Or like terrible breakfast sandwich or like prepackaged salads"
06:37;06:40;"And it would just be called like, Southwest Grill"
06:40;06:42;"Cactus Jacks"
06:44;06:46;"So you do see this stuff all over the place"
06:46;06:49;"Or like literally the exact same place would be at JFK"
06:49;06:52;"It would just be like Big Apple and like some little sun"
06:52;06:54;"Like forget about it"
06:54;07:00;"So anyway, when you see a Yard House somewhere in an airport"
07:00;07:02;"I just kind of assumed that it was"
07:02;07:06;"Because there's also like a Rolling Stone branded airport restaurant"
07:06;07:08;"It's the same thing"
07:08;07:12;"It's the same burger and bad fries you get at any airport restaurant"
07:12;07:15;"Except there's like a picture of Eddie Van Halen on the wall"
07:15;07:18;"And it's just like, ""Come in and let's rock"" or whatever"
07:18;07:22;"So I assumed that Yard House was an airport restaurant"
07:22;07:24;"To find out that there's 80 is"
07:24;07:26;"I don't quite know how to put it"
07:26;07:30;"But you know like all these kind of 20th century"
07:30;07:33;"Like highbrow philosophers and French theorists"
07:33;07:38;"There's like a lot of talk about like the spectacle taking over"
07:38;07:41;"Or things that were supposed to merely signify"
07:41;07:44;"Start to take up all the space"
07:44;07:46;"Or whenever people in the 60s started in the 70s"
07:46;07:48;"Started talking about pseudo events"
07:48;07:50;"There's just something I can totally picture French theorists"
07:50;07:54;"Just be like, ""The airport restaurant has left the airport"""
07:54;07:56;"The airport used to be a liminal space"
07:56;07:59;"That was surrounded by the quote unquote ""real"""
07:59;08:01;"Whereas now the airport is the world"
08:01;08:04;"Normally, historically you'd be in the airport"
08:04;08:06;"You would see the airport chilis"
08:06;08:09;"It would be smaller than your brick and mortar stand-alone chilis"
08:09;08:11;"That you would encounter out in the real world"
08:11;08:12;"Right"
08:12;08:14;"But now it does feel like that"
08:14;08:15;"Yard House"
08:15;08:17;"[Laughs]"
08:17;08:21;"Like the Yard House is the airport restaurant experience"
08:21;08:25;"And it's available for you in your local shopping center"
08:25;08:27;"Right, because if you saw that"
08:27;08:30;"That kind of fake little airport chilis back in the day"
08:30;08:31;"You would at least say to yourself"
08:31;08:33;"""Well, I am at the airport"""
08:33;08:37;"""I'm briefly in this hellish, vibeless place"""
08:37;08:40;"""But soon I'll be back at my local chilis"""
08:40;08:43;"""Having a good time with my friends and family"""
08:43;08:45;"""And experiencing culture"""
08:45;08:46;"""Whereas-"""
08:46;08:48;"""With a rich texture"""
08:48;08:53;"""Whereas now, truly, the airport has colonized the non-airport world"""
08:53;08:54;"And there is something true about that"
08:54;08:57;"You walk into like a vibeless airport sometimes"
08:57;08:59;"What's changed?"
08:59;09:00;"I don't even complain"
09:00;09:04;"Yeah, is it that the airport cuisine has been elevated?"
09:04;09:06;"That's what they want you to think"
09:06;09:07;"[Laughs]"
09:07;09:10;"Is that the world outside has become degraded?"
09:10;09:11;"Truly"
09:11;09:12;"Damn, dude"
09:12;09:14;"Anyway, shout out to the Yard House"
09:14;09:16;"World's largest selection of crap food"
10:04;10:12;"And then, I guess to be fair"
10:12;10:14;"You only went to the Pasadena one"
10:14;10:15;"I've never been to one"
10:15;10:19;"We should really go out to maybe one of the top Yard Houses"
10:19;10:20;"Try to have a good time"
10:20;10:21;"Maybe the OG"
10:21;10:22;"TC Christmas"
10:22;10:23;"Oh yeah, we should do a TC Christmas there"
10:23;10:24;"There you go"
10:24;10:25;"Wait, so can you find-"
10:25;10:26;"What's the-"
10:26;10:29;"Is there a certain Yard House that's known as kind of like the best Yard House?"
10:29;10:32;"Maybe there's like an original one down in Long Beach or something?"
10:32;10:35;"Yeah, well it was founded in Long Beach"
10:35;10:39;"I've been looking at the menu for the LA Live at Staples Center one"
10:39;10:40;"And it's extensive"
10:40;10:42;"Like I had to scroll multiple times"
10:42;10:44;"But yeah, I mean it's founded in Long Beach"
10:44;10:46;"So I think that would be the home base"
10:46;10:48;"Nine different types of Hefeweizen"
10:48;10:51;"I mean they've got a whole gluten-free section"
10:51;10:54;"I mean it looks pretty slamming actually, the food"
10:54;10:56;"And one thing that's amazing"
10:56;10:58;"They've got a vampire taco"
10:58;10:59;"Wait, really?"
10:59;11:00;"Yeah, they've got a vampire taco"
11:00;11:01;"What's that?"
11:01;11:04;"I have to assume it's a tribute to Classic Rock at Vampire Weekend"
11:04;11:05;"Yeah, I know, I was surprised to-"
11:05;11:06;"Jam Band"
11:06;11:08;"Vampire Weekend"
11:08;11:10;"Historic Jam Band Vampire Weekend"
11:11;11:14;"Oh, because they probably also have like a Van Halen taco or-"
11:14;11:16;"No, the vampire taco"
11:16;11:18;"So it's $6.29, it's cheese-crusted tortilla"
11:18;11:21;"Carnitas, bacon, roasted garlic, avocado"
11:21;11:23;"I mean it's all the fixings"
11:23;11:24;"Wait, how much was that?"
11:24;11:25;"$6.29"
11:25;11:27;"Per taco or is that for two?"
11:27;11:28;"That's just for one"
11:28;11:29;"Hmm"
11:29;11:30;"Okay"
11:30;11:31;"470 calories"
11:31;11:32;"Steep inflation"
11:32;11:34;"Well, airport prices"
11:36;11:40;"We're bringing airport prices to your town"
11:40;11:44;"$6.29 for a taco"
11:44;11:47;"That is truly like some gourmet"
11:47;11:51;"Like if you went to like the fanciest New California cuisine"
11:51;11:52;"That had like, you know, like"
11:52;11:54;"Ahi-ahi tacos, fresh"
11:54;11:56;"There's so much ahi on this menu"
11:56;11:58;"That would be $6 a taco"
11:58;11:59;"Right"
11:59;12:00;"At a nice restaurant"
12:00;12:01;"I mean look at this taco, Jake"
12:01;12:03;"I mean this is sophisticated"
12:03;12:04;"But why is it called the vam-"
12:04;12:05;"Oh, because it has garlic on it?"
12:05;12:06;"It's the vampire taco"
12:06;12:07;"Oh, there you go"
12:07;12:08;"Yeah"
12:08;12:09;"Which would be the anti-"
12:09;12:10;"Not a fan of the hard shell"
12:10;12:11;"Vampire, personally, but"
12:11;12:14;"And look at that little metal supporting structure that they have"
12:14;12:17;"Honestly, in that picture it looks kind of artisanal"
12:17;12:19;"One last thing to say about the Yardhouse"
12:19;12:21;"Again, just because I'm staring at Jake's t-shirt"
12:21;12:24;"It's also hard to put into words, but I'll try"
12:24;12:28;"Just how uninspiring the logo is"
12:28;12:33;"It does not look like a place that would have 80 locations"
12:33;12:37;"Just because even when you think about places that you might not consider particularly cool"
12:37;12:39;"A McDonald's, a Taco Bell"
12:39;12:41;"There's kind of a vibrancy to the branding"
12:41;12:45;"The Yardhouse logo kind of looks like somebody took the Boar's Head"
12:45;12:47;"[Laughter]"
12:47;12:48;"The Boar's Head deli meats logo"
12:48;12:49;"This is a good call"
12:49;12:50;"Full on Boar's Head"
12:50;12:53;"But then removed the actual, like, Boar's Head"
12:53;12:56;"Just to make it so vibeless"
12:56;12:58;"It kind of looks like an AI"
12:58;12:59;"Yeah"
12:59;13:00;"Just like, put it together"
13:00;13:02;"It looks like a vector file from Adobe Illustrator"
13:02;13:03;"Yeah, truly"
13:03;13:06;"It's kind of like something that says"
13:06;13:10;"Well, you know, of course you'll vibe it up with your own restaurant's name"
13:10;13:11;"And you'll maybe add a little logo"
13:11;13:14;"And it's like, no, let's just use that"
13:14;13:16;"It's Times New Roman for sure"
13:16;13:18;"And anyway, I'm just comparing it to the Hard Rock Cafe"
13:18;13:19;"Which also you could clown on"
13:19;13:22;"But Hard Rock Cafe's shirts have aged so well"
13:22;13:23;"Oh, they're classic"
13:23;13:24;"They look great"
13:24;13:28;"I feel like growing up you always knew some kid who collected them"
13:28;13:30;"Yeah, oh, like you got the Maui one, dude?"
13:30;13:32;"Like, Paca Poco?"
13:32;13:34;"Wow"
13:34;13:36;"The locations was always, like, the coolest part"
13:36;13:39;"Hard Rock Cafe, Phoenix"
13:39;13:41;"And also, it was kind of a beautiful logo"
13:41;13:43;"I mean, it's the earth, right?"
13:43;13:44;"Are you thinking of Planet Hollywood?"
13:44;13:45;"I think you're thinking of Planet Hollywood"
13:45;13:46;"Oh, okay, so what's the Hard Rock Cafe?"
13:46;13:47;"And it's very simple"
13:47;13:49;"And it says, ""Love all, serve all"""
13:49;13:51;"But it's just, it's tasteful and kind of vibrant"
13:51;13:52;"Oh yeah, it's yellow"
13:52;13:56;"But the Hard Rock, I guess it's kind of based on the Rolling Stone font, maybe"
13:56;13:59;"But it's very, it's kind of fun and memorable"
13:59;14:00;"Right, it is very simple"
14:00;14:02;"And then you would go to the place"
14:02;14:06;"And part of what they were selling was that"
14:06;14:08;"This is not just some boring restaurant"
14:08;14:09;"There's memorabilia"
14:09;14:13;"There's kind of, like, some thought put into how it feels"
14:13;14:16;"Like, you know, kind of like a fun, exciting restaurant"
14:16;14:21;"So it's interesting that Yardhouse just doesn't even try"
14:21;14:24;"I'm looking at the Yardhouse latest tracks on Tap"
14:24;14:26;"On their website"
14:26;14:27;"Not sure what that means"
14:27;14:29;"Track one, ""We Will Rock You"" Queen"
14:29;14:30;"Cool"
14:30;14:33;"Track two, ""Rock You Like a Hurricane"" Scorpions"
14:33;14:34;"Heh"
14:34;14:35;"Eh"
14:35;14:38;"Track three, ""99 Luftballoons"""
14:38;14:40;"Oh, that's a good song"
14:40;14:41;"By Naina"
14:41;14:45;"Track four, ""Tubthumping"" by Chumbalumba"
14:45;14:47;"[Laughter]"
14:47;14:49;"""Boot Scrape"" by The Ramones"
14:49;14:52;"""Sweet Caroline"" by Neil Diamond"
14:52;14:55;"""Hey Baby"" by someone named Bruce Channel"
14:55;14:57;"[Laughter]"
14:57;14:58;"Not familiar"
14:58;15:00;"""Hand Clap"" by Fitz and the Tantrums"
15:00;15:02;"Oh, that's from like three years ago"
15:02;15:03;"Yeah, that's very recent"
15:03;15:06;"""Seven Nation Army"" by a band called The White Stripes"
15:06;15:08;"[Laughter]"
15:08;15:10;"""Rock of Ages"" by Def Leppard"
15:10;15:12;"Bad Leppard song, by the way"
15:12;15:14;"So there's no..."
15:14;15:16;"They're not even sticking to classic rock"
15:16;15:18;"That should be 68 to 80"
15:18;15:22;"On the Yardhouse website that links to these playlists"
15:22;15:26;"It says, ""Music from our house, now streaming at yours"""
15:26;15:30;"""Music at the Yardhouse isn't an afterthought, it's a priority"""
15:30;15:37;"""It's part of who we are, that's why every song played at Yardhouse is hand-picked and unique"""
15:37;15:38;"Oh, artisanal"
15:38;15:42;"""These playlists are curated daily for our restaurants"""
15:42;15:45;"""Now we're bringing the soundtrack of Yardhouse to you at home"""
15:45;15:48;"""Featuring current and classic hits"""
15:48;15:52;"Well, that's the rest of the show, we're just gonna stream the Yardhouse playlists"
15:52;15:54;"I like it, they say"
15:54;15:56;"This is interesting, it says"
15:56;16:02;"""Playlists featuring current and classic rock hits that draw from our 10,000-track library"""
16:02;16:06;"So, is this something we've talked about?"
16:06;16:07;"Oh yeah"
16:07;16:10;"They're paying ASCAP for those 10,000 songs?"
16:10;16:11;"But calling it their 10..."
16:11;16:14;"There's something about saying ""our 10,000-song library"""
16:14;16:15;"No, it's hilarious"
16:15;16:19;"It'd be one thing if in the 90s you went to some weird restaurant and they were like"
16:19;16:22;"""We have a 10,000-CD collection"""
16:22;16:24;"You'd be like, ""Impressive!"""
16:24;16:30;"Just today to say ""We have a 10,000-song library"""
16:30;16:34;"That'd be like any one of us going and throwing a barbecue and saying"
16:34;16:35;"You know"
16:35;16:36;"On our E-Bite"
16:36;16:40;"""Put in your music request, 'cause I have a 10,000-song library"""
16:40;16:42;"You'd just be confused by it, like"
16:42;16:43;"That's it?"
16:43;16:47;"Do you have Led Zeppelin? Is that available? The Eagles?"
16:47;16:49;"Or is that too expensive?"
16:49;16:53;"You don't have an Apple Music subscription"
16:53;16:56;"I get knocked down, but I get up again"
16:56;16:58;"Yeah, they're never gonna keep me down"
16:58;17:01;"I get knocked down, but I get up again"
17:01;17:03;"Yeah, they're never gonna keep me down"
17:03;17:05;"I get knocked down, but I get up again"
17:05;17:07;"Yeah, they're never gonna keep me down"
17:07;17:10;"I get knocked down, but I get up again"
17:10;17:12;"Yeah, they're never gonna keep me down"
17:12;17:17;"Oh, it's in the night away"
17:17;17:21;"Oh, it's in the night away"
17:21;17:24;"He drinks a whiskey drink, he drinks a bottle of drink"
17:24;17:26;"He drinks a lager drink, he drinks a cider drink"
17:26;17:28;"He sings the songs that remind him of the good times"
17:28;17:31;"He sings the songs that remind him of the bad times"
17:31;17:39;"Oh, Danny boy, Danny boy, Danny boy"
17:39;17:42;"I get knocked down, but I get up again"
17:42;17:44;"Yeah, they're never gonna keep me down"
17:44;17:47;"I get knocked down, but I get up again"
17:47;17:49;"Yeah, they're never gonna keep me down"
17:49;17:52;"I get knocked down, but I get up again"
17:52;17:54;"Yeah, they're never gonna keep me down"
17:54;17:56;"I get knocked down, but I get up again"
17:56;17:58;"Yeah, they're never gonna keep me down"
17:58;18:02;"Anyway, Yardhouse was created by AI"
18:02;18:04;"and it's colonizing America"
18:04;18:06;"There might be one near you"
18:06;18:07;"Go check it out"
18:07;18:09;"Who's to say you won't have a good time there?"
18:09;18:12;"I've had times there"
18:12;18:15;"Are you saying that Yardhouse is the first sentient restaurant"
18:15;18:19;"run by the Simulation or whatever?"
18:19;18:22;"Singularity is just, they're just duplicating"
18:22;18:23;"Exactly"
18:23;18:25;"Sorry humans, you don't stand a chance"
18:25;18:27;"Go to the Yardhouse"
18:27;18:31;"So anyway, there would be no Yardhouse"
18:31;18:35;"Keep saying Yardhouse"
18:35;18:37;"There would be no Yardhouse"
18:37;18:41;"without the man we're dedicating this episode to"
18:41;18:43;"He's arguably the grandfather of the Yardhouse"
18:43;18:46;"because he was the first king of rock and roll"
18:46;18:48;"His name's Elvis Presley"
18:48;18:50;"Okay, the first thing I wanted to talk about"
18:50;18:52;"What's up with the name Elvis?"
18:52;18:54;"This crossed my mind when I was just"
18:54;18:56;"kind of thinking that we were gonna do this"
18:56;18:58;"You see the name Elvis pop up here and there"
18:58;19:01;"like there's other musicians named Elvis and stuff"
19:01;19:02;"and obviously it's like Elvis Costello"
19:02;19:04;"people take the name"
19:04;19:06;"but where does this name come from?"
19:06;19:09;"Were there people named Elvis before Elvis Presley?"
19:09;19:11;"Is it an old name?"
19:11;19:13;"The name Elvis is primarily a male name"
19:13;19:15;"with Scandinavian origin"
19:15;19:17;"and it means all wise"
19:17;19:19;"All wise?"
19:19;19:21;"Interesting"
19:21;19:23;"It always cracked me up that Elvis was known"
19:23;19:25;"initially for like getting on TV and"
19:25;19:27;"shaking his hips"
19:27;19:29;"and I always thought it was funny that Elvis"
19:29;19:31;"rhymed so closely with pelvis"
19:31;19:33;"And I think there's a few songs where people"
19:33;19:34;"made use of that"
19:34;19:35;"Really?"
19:35;19:37;"Did Steve Urkel say that in the Urkel dance?"
19:37;19:39;"Something about"
19:39;19:41;"Move your pelvis just like Elvis"
19:41;19:43;"It's better than Elvis is the line"
19:43;19:45;"It's a good question"
19:45;19:49;"Are there prominent Elvi before Elvis Presley?"
19:49;19:50;"There's gotta be"
19:50;19:52;"Well it's an old Norse name"
19:52;19:53;"This might help give it context"
19:53;19:54;"Old Norse?"
19:54;19:56;"Yeah, Alvis"
19:56;19:58;"A-L-V-I-S"
19:58;19:59;"Alvis"
19:59;20:01;"One of the characters in the Northmen"
20:01;20:02;"Ah, right, yeah"
20:02;20:03;"Elvis!"
20:03;20:05;"In Norse mythology there was a dwarf character"
20:05;20:07;"named Alvis, all wise"
20:07;20:09;"who was betrothed to Thor's daughter"
20:09;20:11;"Thor was displeased with the notion"
20:11;20:13;"of his daughter marrying a dwarf"
20:13;20:15;"What?"
20:15;20:17;"And so the god required Alvis to answer"
20:17;20:19;"a series of questions designed to prove his wisdom"
20:19;20:21;"Alvis agreed to the challenge"
20:21;20:23;"his rapid fire and wise answers"
20:23;20:25;"to each of Thor's questions"
20:25;20:27;"kept him going through the night"
20:27;20:29;"In the end Thor outwitted his adversary"
20:29;20:31;"by keeping him distracted until dawn"
20:31;20:33;"I mean I could go on about this"
20:33;20:35;"I didn't even know Thor had a daughter"
20:35;20:37;"so this is breaking news that Alvis is actually"
20:37;20:39;"part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"
20:39;20:41;"Who knew?"
20:41;20:43;"I'm amazed that this"
20:43;20:45;"I never learned this before"
20:45;20:47;"so everybody listening now because"
20:47;20:49;"part of the reason we're talking about Alvis"
20:49;20:51;"is that there's a movie coming out"
20:51;20:53;"about him, I think it's called Alvis"
20:53;20:55;"so everybody's got Alvis fever once again"
20:55;20:57;"but that's a pretty interesting fun fact"
20:57;20:59;"next time somebody's talking about Alvis"
20:59;21:01;"you can pretend that you think they're talking about"
21:01;21:03;"the dwarf who tried to marry Thor's daughter"
21:03;21:05;"no no I'm talking about the popular"
21:05;21:07;"southern singer known as"
21:07;21:09;"the king of rock and roll, oh I thought you said Alvis"
21:09;21:11;"my bad"
21:11;21:13;"so the name Alvis comes from a very wise dwarf"
21:13;21:15;"who tried to marry Thor's daughter"
21:15;21:17;"I wonder if Alvis knew that"
21:17;21:19;"well Alvis did"
21:19;21:21;"just so you know"
21:21;21:23;"Alvis's father was Vernon Alvis Presley"
21:23;21:25;"so it had been a family name"
21:25;21:27;"interesting"
21:27;21:29;"did the Presleys have"
21:29;21:31;"Scandinavian heritage?"
21:31;21:33;"Father Vernon was of German, Scottish"
21:33;21:35;"and English origins"
21:35;21:37;"Presley's mother was Scots Irish"
21:37;21:39;"with some French Norman ancestry"
21:39;21:41;"ok so Alvis is not"
21:41;21:43;"Scandinavian but still"
21:43;21:45;"Alvis was a"
21:45;21:47;"family name so clearly"
21:47;21:49;"Alvis, very old name"
21:49;21:51;"it just so happened that in the 1950s"
21:51;21:53;"it's time had come"
21:53;21:55;"to really explode on the scene"
21:55;21:57;"you know I really would have thought"
21:57;21:59;"maybe I wondered if it would be some weird combination"
21:59;22:01;"name that would just like a new"
22:01;22:03;"name in the 50s"
22:03;22:05;"it's one of those names too that is"
22:05;22:07;"associated with"
22:07;22:09;"such a major icon that"
22:09;22:11;"it's hard to name someone Alvis after"
22:11;22:13;"the rise of Alvis"
22:13;22:15;"it's like naming a kid Adolph"
22:15;22:17;"even though we love Alvis"
22:17;22:19;"it's just kind of silly"
22:19;22:21;"to name your kid Alvis"
22:21;22:23;"it's just always going to be like oh"
22:23;22:25;"did your parents like"
22:25;22:27;"the king? I've never met an Alvis, have you?"
22:27;22:29;"met an Alvis? No"
22:29;22:31;"I wonder if it's still common in Scandinavia"
22:31;22:33;"or if even in Scandinavia"
22:33;22:35;"we gotta get out of Scandinavia"
22:35;22:39;"then we flew to Scandinavia"
22:39;22:41;"we did some on the ground research"
22:41;22:43;"I wonder if in Scandinavia, because definitely"
22:43;22:45;"there is a thing like there's real"
22:45;22:47;"rockabilly culture in Sweden"
22:47;22:49;"really? yeah I don't know how"
22:49;22:51;"I know that, I don't know if I witnessed it"
22:51;22:53;"first hand or if I'm just like"
22:53;22:55;"vaguely remembering something that I read but"
22:55;22:57;"Scandinavia, especially Sweden, rides hard"
22:57;22:59;"for rock. In fact, some people"
22:59;23:01;"even describe Sweden as a place with great food and"
23:01;23:03;"classic rock. Like Bruce Springsteen"
23:03;23:05;"goes to Sweden, kills it"
23:05;23:07;"Bob Dylan, blow out arenas"
23:07;23:09;"in Sweden and there is"
23:09;23:11;"a kind of historical Swedish"
23:11;23:13;"rockabilly culture to this day"
23:13;23:15;"so I wonder if even in"
23:15;23:17;"a place like Sweden, the name"
23:17;23:19;"Alvis is now more associated with"
23:19;23:21;"the American entertainer"
23:21;23:23;"than it is with"
23:23;23:25;"Alvis, the dwarf"
23:25;23:29;"who tried to marry"
23:29;23:31;"Thor's daughter. And if that's true"
23:31;23:33;"that's a sad state of affairs because you should never"
23:33;23:35;"forget your heritage. Apparently there are"
23:35;23:37;"16,816"
23:37;23:39;"Americans with the name Elvis"
23:39;23:41;"Wait, how many? 16,816"
23:41;23:43;"So that's nothing"
23:43;23:45;"There's one person named Elvis"
23:45;23:47;"Presley who's not Elvis Presley"
23:47;23:49;"in the US. Okay"
23:49;23:51;"That's insane. It's the"
23:51;23:53;"1495th"
23:53;23:55;"most popular"
23:55;23:57;"first name in America"
23:57;23:59;"One out of every"
23:59;24:01;"13,667"
24:01;24:03;"baby boys born in"
24:03;24:05;"2020 are named Elvis"
24:05;24:07;"Well that number is about to go through the roof"
24:07;24:09;"after the hit movie"
24:09;24:11;"Elvis comes out"
24:11;24:13;"after this episode of Time Crisis"
24:13;24:15;"Anyway, on this"
24:15;24:17;"episode we're going to be talking to"
24:17;24:19;"various friends of TC,"
24:19;24:21;"Daisy David, Winter, Despot"
24:21;24:23;"who I know has an amazing Elvis story"
24:23;24:25;"But before we get into"
24:25;24:27;"all that, I just wanted to play one of the"
24:27;24:29;"first Elvis songs that comes to my mind"
24:29;24:31;"when I think about Elvis. And actually"
24:31;24:33;"I had this vague memory of this song"
24:33;24:35;"I think I heard it on the radio"
24:35;24:37;"on WFMU when I was"
24:37;24:39;"a boy and"
24:39;24:41;"I couldn't even tell at the time if"
24:41;24:43;"it sounded like Elvis but"
24:43;24:45;"then when the host said ""That's Elvis"" with the song"
24:45;24:47;"called ""Yoga is as Yoga does"""
24:47;24:49;"I just had to assume it was some sort of like"
24:49;24:51;"joke or like an Elvis impersonator"
24:51;24:53;"or something. But this is a real song"
24:53;24:55;"from the early 70's"
24:55;24:57;"that Elvis dropped. It's called ""Yoga is"
24:57;24:59;"as Yoga does"" Check it out"
24:59;25:01;"You ever heard this Jake? Have we talked"
25:01;25:03;"about this? No, I've never heard this"
25:03;25:05;"Well I"
25:05;25:07;"can see that you"
25:07;25:09;"and yoga will"
25:09;25:11;"never do"
25:11;25:13;"[laughs]"
25:15;25:17;"Yoga is as yoga does"
25:17;25:19;"there's no in between"
25:19;25:21;"you're either with it"
25:21;25:23;"on the ball or"
25:23;25:25;"you're blown to sea"
25:25;25:27;"I can see looking at"
25:27;25:29;"you, just can't you"
25:29;25:31;"settle? How can"
25:31;25:33;"I even move"
25:33;25:35;"twisted like a pretzel?"
25:37;25:39;"Jordan Ayers? Yeah"
25:39;25:41;"I'm back up with Elvis"
25:41;25:43;"Word Awards?"
25:43;25:45;"Or you're blown to sea"
25:47;25:49;"Come on,"
25:49;25:51;"come on, I twist my legs"
25:51;25:53;"pull my arms a lot"
25:53;25:55;"How did I get"
25:55;25:57;"so tied up in this"
25:57;25:59;"yoga knot?"
25:59;26:01;"You tell me just how"
26:01;26:03;"I take this yoga"
26:03;26:05;"serious, but all it"
26:05;26:07;"ever gives to me"
26:07;26:09;"is a pain in my posterior"
26:09;26:11;"[laughs]"
26:11;26:13;"Amazing"
26:13;26:15;"I wonder if there's anybody listening to our show right now"
26:15;26:17;"who's hearing Elvis for the first time"
26:17;26:19;"Some kid in the car"
26:19;26:21;"This is the King of Rock?"
26:21;26:23;"This is the King of Rock"
26:23;26:25;"Stand upside down on your head"
26:25;26:27;"feet against the wall"
26:27;26:29;"a simple yoga"
26:29;26:31;"exercise done by"
26:31;26:33;"one and all"
26:33;26:35;"Now cross your eyes and hold your breath"
26:35;26:37;"look just like a"
26:37;26:39;"clown"
26:39;26:41;"I'm sure to catch you"
26:41;26:43;"you come falling down"
26:45;26:53;"Or you're blown to sea"
26:53;26:55;"[laughs]"
26:55;26:57;"Or you've blown to sea"
26:57;26:59;"So this says it was released"
26:59;27:01;"in 1967"
27:01;27:03;"Oh, okay, maybe the album"
27:03;27:05;"Or you're blown to sea"
27:05;27:07;"His vocals are maxing out"
27:09;27:11;"[laughs]"
27:11;27:13;"A pain in my"
27:13;27:15;"posterior"
27:15;27:17;"Even"
27:17;27:19;"1967, how"
27:19;27:21;"I think we talked about this on the show, the fact that"
27:21;27:23;"an actual hit song that"
27:23;27:25;"references yoga is"
27:25;27:27;"Do You Like Pina Coladas? by Rupert Holmes"
27:27;27:29;"Right, which is probably like"
27:29;27:31;"'78 or something?"
27:31;27:33;"Yeah, much later, and that makes sense that"
27:33;27:35;"by the late '70s"
27:35;27:37;"it would make sense to have a hit song that"
27:37;27:39;"'cause that song's about looking for like"
27:39;27:41;"a cool person who's into Pina Coladas"
27:41;27:43;"and there's a part that goes, ""If you're not into yoga"""
27:43;27:45;"So that's like a"
27:45;27:47;"rejection of the hippie idea"
27:47;27:49;"But if you ask me, by what"
27:49;27:51;"year would"
27:51;27:53;"the majority of Americans have"
27:53;27:55;"a sense of yoga"
27:55;27:57;"what yoga means to"
27:57;27:59;"the average American, the exercises"
27:59;28:01;"I know it means more than that"
28:01;28:03;"but positive or negative"
28:03;28:05;"I would have guessed late '70s"
28:05;28:07;"By like '67"
28:07;28:09;"I wonder if there were just like some"
28:09;28:11;"Elvis probably had some random people"
28:11;28:13;"in the deep south buying this record"
28:13;28:15;"and just being like, ""What the f*** is he talking about?"""
28:15;28:17;"Oh, I'm sure, dude"
28:17;28:19;"It sounds like he was early in. Actually, this is really fascinating"
28:19;28:21;"because I live near Mount Washington"
28:21;28:23;"which is a neighborhood in"
28:23;28:25;"northeast LA, and on the top"
28:25;28:27;"of Mount Washington there is this self-realization"
28:27;28:29;"center"
28:29;28:31;"that's been there for decades"
28:31;28:33;"I've never been in there, but I know"
28:33;28:35;"real yoga heads are like, ""Oh yeah, that's"
28:35;28:37;"a historically significant place in the yoga"
28:37;28:39;"world."" And according to"
28:39;28:41;"the notes here, Elvis would visit it"
28:41;28:43;"frequently. So just picturing"
28:43;28:45;"Elvis in Mount Washington"
28:45;28:47;"in the mid '60s"
28:47;28:49;"is very fascinating"
28:49;28:51;"because I always got the sense in LA"
28:51;28:53;"in the '60s, if you were a big"
28:53;28:55;"deal, you didn't go east of"
28:55;28:57;"La Brea"
28:57;28:59;"You certainly weren't going to Silver"
28:59;29:01;"Lake and Echo Park. So I love to"
29:01;29:03;"think about him trucking over to"
29:03;29:05;"Mount Washington. So"
29:05;29:07;"I guess starting in 1964"
29:07;29:09;"Elvis Presley's hairdresser"
29:09;29:11;"Larry Geller introduced him"
29:11;29:13;"to the teachings of"
29:13;29:15;"Paramahansa Yogananda, a pioneer"
29:15;29:17;"of both meditation and yoga in"
29:17;29:19;"America. During this time, Elvis"
29:19;29:21;"became close with Yogananda"
29:21;29:23;"who founded the Self-Realization Fellowship"
29:23;29:25;"and I guess"
29:25;29:27;"yoga kind of came between him and Priscilla"
29:27;29:29;"a bit. She was just like,"
29:29;29:31;"""Elvis, honey, what is this?"""
29:31;29:33;"What is this sh*t? And I guess Elvis"
29:33;29:35;"performs this song in the film"
29:35;29:37;"Easy Come Easy Go as an attempt to expand"
29:37;29:39;"yoga's audience to teenagers."
29:39;29:41;"That's amazing."
29:41;29:43;"It was hard for me to understand what the tone"
29:43;29:45;"of the song was. It kind of seemed like"
29:45;29:47;"maybe he's making fun of yoga"
29:47;29:49;"Right, he's talking about his posteriors"
29:49;29:51;"But maybe he's saying"
29:51;29:53;"I guess the chorus he's saying, ""Yoga is"
29:53;29:55;"as yoga does. There's no in-between."
29:55;29:57;"You're either with it all the way,"
29:57;29:59;"or you've blown the scene."""
29:59;30:01;"Which I guess he's saying, what would that mean"
30:01;30:03;"in 1967, say you blew the scene?"
30:03;30:05;"Means you suck? You're a loser?"
30:05;30:07;"Yeah. Oh, don't blow the scene, Jack."
30:07;30:09;"Yeah. Like, don't be"
30:09;30:11;"a square, dude. Yeah, maybe he"
30:11;30:13;"should have had a different arrangement or slightly different"
30:13;30:15;"lyrics, but he's"
30:15;30:17;"The lyrics are bad. So this is a pro-yoga"
30:17;30:19;"song. Interesting. He's not coming"
30:19;30:21;"at it from that Rupert Holmes"
30:21;30:23;"""What is this junk?"""
30:23;30:25;"It's also funny to imagine that"
30:25;30:27;"Elvis was actually spending time"
30:27;30:29;"with a spiritual teacher"
30:29;30:31;"because, as I understand it"
30:31;30:33;"the actual meaning of yoga"
30:33;30:35;"sometimes people in the world of"
30:35;30:37;"Hindu/Vedic philosophy say"
30:37;30:39;"this idea that yoga is just a set of exercises"
30:39;30:41;"is this weird American"
30:41;30:43;"thing. That could be part of it, but the"
30:43;30:45;"whole idea of yoga"
30:45;30:47;"the word means is related"
30:47;30:49;"to the same Indo-European"
30:49;30:51;"root word that means ""yoke"""
30:51;30:53;"to kind of like be joined"
30:53;30:55;"together with a spiritual path"
30:55;30:57;"something really deep"
30:57;30:59;"and so there's different types of yoga"
30:59;31:01;"that could mean all sorts of practices"
31:01;31:03;"meditation could be a form of yoga"
31:03;31:05;"even the way you live your life"
31:05;31:07;"Breathing. In a way it's about a deep"
31:07;31:09;"dedication. I mean I'm"
31:09;31:11;"totally describing in really simple terms, but"
31:11;31:13;"clearly the term yoga has something to do with"
31:13;31:15;"a deep spiritual practice"
31:15;31:17;"so the fact that Elvis would be aware"
31:17;31:19;"of that, maybe this really was something like"
31:19;31:21;"""But how do I get the kids into it?"""
31:21;31:23;"""I can't just drop all this Vedic"
31:23;31:25;"knowledge on them. I need to"
31:25;31:27;"I need a fun song"
31:27;31:29;"with a good beat"
31:29;31:31;"to introduce the children"
31:31;31:33;"to the spiritual"
31:33;31:35;"bliss of knowing God."""
31:35;31:37;"This is healthy, clean living for young America."
31:37;31:39;"That would have been sight of"
31:39;31:41;"in '67 Elvis was going"
31:41;31:43;"full hippy-dippy expand your mind"
31:43;31:45;"but saying no to drugs, which is very"
31:45;31:47;"you know, because Elvis was"
31:47;31:49;"in the 70s linked up with"
31:49;31:51;"the Nixon administration as"
31:51;31:53;"a representative of the DEA."
31:53;31:55;"I could see him in '67 being like"
31:55;31:57;"""I'm a good, clean living Christian"
31:57;31:59;"and I'm interested in"
31:59;32:01;"these Eastern philosophies"
32:01;32:03;"that will help me connect"
32:03;32:05;"you know, in the West they think"
32:05;32:07;"the body and the mind are two separate things"
32:07;32:09;"what I'm learning"
32:09;32:11;"there's a unison."
32:11;32:13;"As a singer, as a"
32:13;32:15;"virtuosic singer and performer"
32:15;32:17;"I mean. Not having seen the film yet"
32:17;32:19;"there's a scene in the trailer"
32:19;32:21;"and apparently this is true"
32:21;32:23;"Elvis kind of like, you know"
32:23;32:25;"being a white boy in the segregated South"
32:25;32:27;"but kind of like creeping around"
32:27;32:29;"a black church. And I think that's part of his"
32:29;32:31;"origin story is that he was so moved"
32:31;32:33;"and felt so connected to gospel"
32:33;32:35;"music and in some ways"
32:35;32:37;"his music was about"
32:37;32:39;"pulling from the Southern white"
32:39;32:41;"and the Southern black religious traditions"
32:41;32:43;"so it is interesting to think"
32:43;32:45;"that maybe Elvis was this like very"
32:45;32:47;"deep spiritual dude and that"
32:47;32:49;"his whole music was like him channeling"
32:49;32:51;"something deeply spiritual"
32:51;32:53;"connecting to God"
32:53;32:55;"and then in the 60s I could totally see that he's introduced"
32:55;32:57;"to these other teachings and he's just like"
32:57;32:59;"""Now listen, anyone who's known"
32:59;33:01;"the bliss of connecting with the higher"
33:01;33:03;"power, the eternal, you're alright in my book"
33:03;33:05;"I don't care if you're from India"
33:05;33:07;"Tupelo, Mississippi"
33:07;33:09;"we got something in common."""
33:09;33:11;"And it is cool that he wasn't into drugs"
33:11;33:13;"that there's anything wrong with drugs but just that"
33:13;33:15;"truly he's not some dude who just"
33:15;33:17;"like took acid and was like ""Whoa!"""
33:17;33:19;"Maybe he was somebody who always felt deeply connected"
33:19;33:21;"to the indescribable"
33:21;33:23;"ineffable eternal"
33:23;33:25;"He absorbed the zeitgeist of the"
33:25;33:27;"60s in his own way"
33:27;33:29;"But he was finding it even in the 40s and 50s"
33:29;33:31;"and yeah maybe he's always been looking"
33:31;33:33;"for that kind of transcendent"
33:33;33:35;"religious thing and"
33:35;33:37;"finally he had a song that he could express"
33:37;33:39;"it with. I hope this is in the movie"
33:39;33:41;"I have a feeling it's not"
33:41;33:43;"Well as I understand it"
33:43;33:45;"the movie opens with"
33:45;33:47;"Elvis in the recording"
33:47;33:49;"studio, 1967"
33:49;33:51;"singing"
33:51;33:53;"this song"
34:15;34:17;"I like him schooling the Jordanaires on"
34:17;34:19;"the lyrics"
34:19;34:21;"Like"
34:21;34:23;"the guys in the Jordanaires"
34:23;34:25;"the day they recorded this song was the first day"
34:25;34:27;"they ever heard the word ""yoga"""
34:27;34:29;"What is yoga?"
34:29;34:31;"How do you pronounce it? Yoga?"
34:31;34:33;"It's just interesting that"
34:33;34:35;"when you start hearing the Beatles"
34:35;34:37;"going to India and getting into Arabic"
34:37;34:39;"there's sort of the sound"
34:39;34:41;"reflects it"
34:41;34:43;"that this song"
34:43;34:45;"is a yoga song"
34:45;34:47;"Yeah, it's the squarest"
34:47;34:49;"It's interesting"
34:49;34:51;"It's not like he experienced"
34:51;34:53;"something and then incorporated it into his music"
34:53;34:55;"Right, and I guess he's a bit older"
34:55;34:57;"than the Beatles. He didn't write this either"
34:57;34:59;"He didn't write anything"
34:59;35:01;"Maybe the truth is"
35:01;35:03;"some guys wrote a yoga novelty song"
35:03;35:05;"Elvis was starting to"
35:05;35:07;"experience the bliss"
35:07;35:09;"of transcending this"
35:09;35:11;"life and connecting with the Brahman"
35:11;35:13;"and somebody said, ""Elvis, this guy's got"
35:13;35:15;"a song about yoga"" and he's like, ""No s***, I'll record it!"""
35:15;35:17;"It probably"
35:17;35:19;"wasn't that deep. I just want to play one more song"
35:19;35:21;"that makes me think of"
35:21;35:23;"before we get on the phone with Kazzy"
35:23;35:25;"Have you guys ever heard this? You know Roger Miller?"
35:25;35:27;"Sure. The country guy?"
35:27;35:29;"He also had a"
35:29;35:31;"kind of interesting song that reminds me of yoga"
35:31;35:33;"as yoga does. It's called ""Reincarnation"""
36:01;36:03;"Amazing. I bet the backstory"
36:03;36:05;"of this song is similar"
36:05;36:07;"What year is this, you know?"
36:07;36:09;"Like, I get number"
36:09;36:11;"reincarnation"
36:19;36:21;"He almost sounds like Townsend and Santa"
36:21;36:23;"Yeah, great B section"
36:23;36:25;"'65?"
36:25;36:27;"'65. Early"
36:27;36:29;"'64"
36:35;36:37;"Maybe Roger Miller"
36:37;36:39;"smoking a little weed for the first time"
36:39;36:41;"some beatnik, talking about"
36:41;36:43;"reincarnation. Roger Miller's just like"
36:43;36:45;"""No s***!"""
36:45;36:47;"Cake has covered this song"
36:47;36:49;"Cake has covered this song? That's tight"
37:05;37:07;"""You're a girl, I'm a boy, but suppose you was"
37:07;37:09;"rose and I was a whipperwheel"""
37:09;37:11;"Amazing. Beautiful"
37:27;37:29;"You know who loved"
37:29;37:31;"this song? I bet it was John Fogerty"
37:31;37:33;"Oh yeah, yeah"
37:33;37:35;"It reminds me of"
37:35;37:37;"""Looking Out Your Back Door"""
37:37;37:39;"""My Back Door"""
37:39;37:41;"Really trippy lyrics"
37:41;37:43;"What is it like?"
37:43;37:45;"""Elephants are playing in the band"""
37:45;37:47;"Like, really surreal lyrics"
37:47;37:49;"out of nowhere. But then with just the folksy"
37:49;37:51;"Yeah"
37:51;37:53;"""Looking at my back door"""
37:53;37:55;"And I think it's also worth pointing out that"
37:55;37:57;"reincarnation's not an exclusively"
37:57;37:59;"Eastern concept"
37:59;38:01;"I think early Christians did believe"
38:01;38:03;"in reincarnation"
38:03;38:05;"Was that the Council of Nicaea?"
38:05;38:07;"They like, some body kind of"
38:07;38:09;"stripped it out? Damn, I don't know dude"
38:09;38:11;"I get a number crunch, did the early Christians"
38:11;38:13;"believe in reincarnation?"
38:13;38:15;"Re-uh"
38:15;38:17;"In-carnation"
38:17;38:19;"It's getting more and more outlandish"
38:19;38:21;"I feel like I get a number crunch, what's the meaning"
38:21;38:23;"of life?"
38:23;38:25;"I mean, many people who believe in"
38:25;38:27;"reincarnation claim that the Bible teaches it"
38:27;38:29;"according to LearnReligions.com"
38:29;38:31;"LearnReligions.com"
38:31;38:33;"I mean, it's a complicated"
38:33;38:35;"this is a number crunch that"
38:35;38:37;"is going to take some theological"
38:37;38:39;"excavation here"
38:39;38:41;"But I can do a little bit of digging"
38:41;38:43;"while we speak to Kazzy"
38:43;38:45;"Yeah, look up the Council of Nicaea"
38:45;38:47;"Was there some time when it kind of"
38:47;38:49;"they put a fatwa on reincarnation"
38:49;38:51;"How'd you stumble across that"
38:51;38:53;"Roger Miller song?"
38:53;38:55;"I think I just heard it once. I mean, I know"
38:55;38:57;"you know who's funny?"
38:57;38:59;"You know, Despot is a big Roger Miller fan"
38:59;39:01;"Really?"
39:01;39:03;"Big Roger Miller fan"
39:03;39:05;"We'll talk about that later. And I remember also talking about"
39:05;39:07;"Roger Miller, I think with my parents"
39:07;39:09;"because when I was"
39:09;39:11;"in London or something, they made some reference"
39:11;39:13;"to he had a hit song later in the 60s"
39:13;39:15;"called it went like, ""London's swinging"
39:15;39:17;"do-da-do, Bobby's on bicycle"
39:17;39:19;"it's two by two"""
39:19;39:21;"He liked topical songs"
39:21;39:23;"Alright, well let's get Kazzy David on the"
39:23;39:25;"horn and see if she can"
39:25;39:27;"what she knows about the early Christians view"
39:27;39:29;"on reincarnation"
39:29;39:31;"Now, let's go to the"
39:31;39:33;"Crisis Hotline"
39:33;39:35;"[phone ringing]"
39:35;39:37;"Hello?"
39:37;39:39;"Kazzy! Hey you guys!"
39:39;39:41;"How's it going? The funniest thing"
39:41;39:43;"is that I didn't know"
39:43;39:45;"you guys were off the air this whole time"
39:45;39:47;"like the last two years. I just thought that"
39:47;39:49;"like, you did all"
39:49;39:51;"I thought you all decided"
39:51;39:53;"to never have me back"
39:53;39:55;"We've been on the air. We haven't had"
39:55;39:57;"we've had very few guests"
39:57;39:59;"You're just one of our top all-timer guests"
39:59;40:01;"Oh, so I was right"
40:01;40:03;"Yeah, you were right. We had Kazzy on during"
40:03;40:05;"the novel"
40:05;40:07;"It hasn't quite been two years"
40:07;40:09;"You told me you've been off the air for two"
40:09;40:11;"years. No, no, no"
40:11;40:13;"Well, that was a misunderstanding"
40:13;40:15;"Kazzy, I think what I said"
40:15;40:17;"was we were back in the studio for the first time"
40:17;40:19;"This is the first time we're all together"
40:19;40:21;"That's right. You're not with us, obviously"
40:21;40:23;"But enough about that. Do you believe in"
40:23;40:25;"reincarnation? Have you ever had a sense that you've"
40:25;40:27;"been here before in some form"
40:27;40:29;"different body, different lifetime?"
40:29;40:31;"I've definitely"
40:31;40:33;"have too much fear to have not experienced"
40:33;40:35;"other lifetimes"
40:35;40:37;"But I can tell, I feel like there's"
40:37;40:39;"a lot of new souls"
40:39;40:41;"in my life that"
40:41;40:43;"have not been reincarnated before"
40:43;40:45;"Oh, okay. It might be their first time around"
40:45;40:47;"Yeah. Were you guys just"
40:47;40:49;"talking about this? We were just listening"
40:49;40:51;"to a country song"
40:51;40:53;"from the 60s called ""Reincarnation"""
40:53;40:55;"It's a great one. We'll send it to you"
40:55;40:57;"So how you been? Where you at these days?"
40:57;40:59;"I'm currently in New York"
40:59;41:01;"which is interesting. Like you're living"
41:01;41:03;"in New York? No, I'm just like here"
41:03;41:05;"for the week. Chilling. Yeah"
41:05;41:07;"My friend brought me down to"
41:07;41:09;"Dime Square last night"
41:09;41:11;"Mmm. A little bit"
41:11;41:13;"Infamous. Yeah. It was really"
41:13;41:15;"interesting"
41:15;41:17;"Everyone is dressed like... I felt"
41:17;41:19;"too nice looking"
41:19;41:21;"Like someone should have"
41:21;41:23;"warned me that you look"
41:23;41:25;"actually dumb if you"
41:25;41:27;"are just like wearing anything that doesn't"
41:27;41:29;"look like it's from a lost and found"
41:29;41:31;"You're bringing that West Side LA"
41:31;41:33;"vibe to Dime Square"
41:33;41:35;"People were like staring at me"
41:35;41:37;"like why is this girl wearing a"
41:37;41:39;"heeled boot? So you actually felt, because"
41:39;41:41;"there's been debate, and for"
41:41;41:43;"people who don't know, Dime Square is an area of"
41:43;41:45;"lower Manhattan around"
41:45;41:47;"a restaurant called Dimes, which"
41:47;41:49;"shout out to my dear old friend"
41:49;41:51;"Andre, who's worked there for years"
41:51;41:53;"And it's kind of associated with the"
41:53;41:55;"podcast Red Scare and"
41:55;41:57;"a certain type of sensibility"
41:57;41:59;"actually being there as a first timer"
41:59;42:01;"in Dime Square, you really did get a vibe"
42:01;42:03;"Yeah. It's interesting"
42:03;42:05;"because it's like, you know, the"
42:05;42:07;"the so-called"
42:07;42:09;"nerd from your high school"
42:09;42:11;"like that's"
42:11;42:13;"what everyone looks like, but"
42:13;42:15;"it's cool, so you can't"
42:15;42:17;"actually tell, because they're doing it on"
42:17;42:19;"purpose, they're dressing like that on purpose"
42:19;42:21;"it's not because they're"
42:21;42:23;"like a nerd"
42:23;42:25;"Were we talking about braces? Were we talking about coke bottle glasses?"
42:25;42:27;"We're talking about like sandals"
42:27;42:29;"Sandals? Like maybe like a beret"
42:29;42:31;"Oh, okay. Like kind of a"
42:31;42:33;"drama club? Theater"
42:33;42:35;"kid? Like no, like a science"
42:35;42:37;"nerd, like a weird shirt"
42:37;42:39;"Like a lab coat?"
42:39;42:41;"[laughter]"
42:41;42:43;"Uh"
42:43;42:45;"Like Steve Urkel when he's doing"
42:45;42:47;"one of his experiments? I feel like"
42:47;42:49;"Kazzy's era of nerd is like"
42:49;42:51;"different from ours. You think so?"
42:51;42:53;"You know who Steve Urkel is?"
42:53;42:55;"Yeah. You know Screech?"
42:55;42:57;"No. You don't know Screech?"
42:57;42:59;"No. The nerd from TV,"
42:59;43:01;"rest in peace? I don't"
43:01;43:03;"Saved by the Bell? Yeah, I've heard of it"
43:03;43:05;"How about Elvis Presley?"
43:05;43:07;"Heard of him. No, I don't"
43:07;43:09;"We do this every time"
43:09;43:11;"[laughter]"
43:11;43:13;"Do you care about Elvis? I care about"
43:13;43:15;"Elvis. I... Have you"
43:15;43:17;"guys been seeing all the like press stuff"
43:17;43:19;"for the movie? Exactly"
43:19;43:21;"So that's kind of put him back on our"
43:21;43:23;"radar. Do you care about"
43:23;43:25;"this movie? Are you gonna see it? I'm gonna see"
43:25;43:27;"it. I'm really interested"
43:27;43:29;"in the actor still talking"
43:29;43:31;"like Elvis two years later"
43:31;43:33;"Oh yeah, what's the story with that?"
43:33;43:35;"He got trapped in the character? He's"
43:35;43:37;"basically going around talking"
43:37;43:39;"like Elvis still and"
43:39;43:41;"you know, people have been inquiring like"
43:41;43:43;"why are you still talking like Elvis and he's"
43:43;43:45;"like, you know, I just can't"
43:45;43:47;"I've lived this guy"
43:47;43:49;"for so long"
43:49;43:51;"and so he's just, yeah"
43:51;43:53;"I guess he's stuck. It's up to interpretation"
43:53;43:55;"whether or not that's"
43:55;43:57;"true? Well, I know for a fact"
43:57;43:59;"that that guy has filmed other"
43:59;44:01;"stuff I think since this movie"
44:01;44:03;"[laughter] Maybe he just did it all in a"
44:03;44:05;"southern accent. Yeah, yeah"
44:05;44:07;"That is very interesting because we were just talking"
44:07;44:09;"about how Elvis is a very"
44:09;44:11;"spiritual dude. You know, he really connected"
44:11;44:13;"music with his love"
44:13;44:15;"for God which he experienced through various traditions"
44:15;44:17;"Eastern and Western"
44:17;44:19;"I don't think it's impossible that"
44:19;44:21;"Elvis might still exist in the spirit"
44:21;44:23;"realm and maybe even"
44:23;44:25;"a part of him is now part of this young man"
44:25;44:27;"haunting him, if you will"
44:27;44:29;"That's best case scenario"
44:29;44:31;"Yeah, best case"
44:31;44:33;"I hope this guy gets nominated for an Oscar or something"
44:33;44:35;"Yeah. He's really going that far"
44:35;44:37;"But what did"
44:37;44:39;"Elvis mean to you before the movie?"
44:39;44:41;"Good tunes, cool"
44:41;44:43;"guy, hot"
44:43;44:45;"[laughter]"
44:45;44:47;"Cool guy"
44:47;44:49;"Did you ever"
44:49;44:51;"love an Elvis song"
44:51;44:53;"on repeat? No, no, no"
44:53;44:55;"What about"
44:55;44:57;"""Fool's Russian"" ""Can't Help Falling In Love With You"""
44:57;44:59;"Did you ever have an emotional moment to that"
44:59;45:01;"in your life? I did not"
45:01;45:03;"Do you know the song when I just say"
45:03;45:05;"the name? Um, no"
45:05;45:07;"[laughter]"
45:07;45:09;"""As men say"""
45:09;45:11;"Yeah. I'm having"
45:11;45:13;"really a lot of deja vu"
45:13;45:15;"right now. I feel like we've had the exact same conversation"
45:15;45:17;"about five other people"
45:17;45:19;"It was Billy Joel"
45:19;45:21;"[laughter]"
45:21;45:23;"Of course you know Elvis"
45:23;45:25;"You're aware, seems like a cool"
45:25;45:27;"guy, like the music well enough"
45:27;45:29;"but you never had a moment"
45:29;45:31;"in your life where you were"
45:31;45:33;"deeply connecting to a recording"
45:33;45:35;"of his or caring a lot about"
45:35;45:37;"I feel like if I sat down and watched an Elvis"
45:37;45:39;"documentary, like I'd probably start"
45:39;45:41;"like an obsession"
45:41;45:43;"where I go down a rabbit hole"
45:43;45:45;"of all Elvis"
45:45;45:47;"things. He seems like"
45:47;45:49;"someone I would become obsessed with"
45:49;45:51;"not in like the way where it's like I love him"
45:51;45:53;"but just like"
45:53;45:55;"you know, just a fascination"
45:55;45:57;"but I haven't gone down that spiral yet"
45:57;45:59;"Did you know any kids growing up"
45:59;46:01;"who were obsessed with Elvis?"
46:01;46:03;"Were there any Elvis kids at your school?"
46:03;46:05;"You know, I don't know if there were Elvis kids"
46:05;46:07;"at my school"
46:07;46:09;"but you know, there could have been"
46:09;46:11;"there could have been"
46:11;46:13;"Can I ask though, Kazzy, you're a fan of Eminem, right?"
46:13;46:15;"Yeah, big Eminem fan"
46:15;46:17;"There's a song"
46:17;46:19;"""Without Me"" where he like kind of compares himself"
46:19;46:21;"to Elvis and then the music video"
46:21;46:23;"he's dressed as Elvis and there's like a parallel"
46:23;46:25;"between where he's"
46:25;46:27;"kind of saying he's the rap Elvis"
46:27;46:29;"you know what I'm talking about?"
46:29;46:31;"Yeah, but don't you feel like everyone feels like they're the"
46:31;46:33;"current Elvis?"
46:33;46:35;"Right, just kind of how like so many people"
46:35;46:37;"were like, say they were the Beatles of rap"
46:37;46:39;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
46:39;46:41;"Jay-Z, Ray Shremmer"
46:41;46:43;"If you're not in a band"
46:43;46:45;"I think you probably assume you're the modern Elvis"
46:45;46:47;"Elvis is always like the standard"
46:47;46:49;"like people"
46:49;46:51;"break Elvis' record"
46:51;46:53;"on Billboard and then they're like I'm the new Elvis"
46:53;46:55;"Right, although"
46:55;46:57;"Eminem really has a lot of parallels with Elvis"
46:57;46:59;"I'm guessing probably"
46:59;47:01;"in ways good and bad, you can imagine"
47:01;47:03;"some people being like yeah, you are"
47:03;47:05;"rap's Elvis"
47:05;47:07;"Thief"
47:07;47:09;"Well, just the fact that they were these"
47:09;47:11;"They're both performers"
47:11;47:13;"They're both"
47:13;47:15;"Caucasian performers"
47:15;47:17;"Their birth names both start with E"
47:17;47:19;"Eminem and Elvis"
47:19;47:21;"And then they both were like these"
47:21;47:23;"they both became kind of known"
47:23;47:25;"as like these, in some circles, as these"
47:25;47:27;"cultural appropriators who"
47:27;47:29;"came from a black tradition, although in both"
47:29;47:31;"cases, I think"
47:31;47:33;"they would feel like they"
47:33;47:35;"at least partially grew up in it and had a deeper"
47:35;47:37;"connection than say like"
47:37;47:39;"a Vanilla Ice or like the truly"
47:39;47:41;"like kind of flimsy culture"
47:41;47:43;"vulture types"
47:43;47:45;"In that sense, I feel like Eminem"
47:45;47:47;"and Elvis, also both being kind of like"
47:47;47:49;"working class"
47:49;47:51;"I mean Elvis says it in, I mean Elvis, Eminem"
47:51;47:53;"in that song, the lyric is"
47:53;47:55;"""Though I'm not the first king of controversy"
47:55;47:57;"I'm the worst thing since Elvis Presley"
47:57;47:59;"to do black music so selfishly"
47:59;48:01;"Kazzy?"
48:01;48:03;"Yeah. I don't-"
48:03;48:05;"And use it to get myself wealthy. There you go"
48:05;48:07;"I mean, El-"
48:07;48:09;"Like what's that really dumb meme that's like"
48:09;48:11;"Eminem could do what Elvis does"
48:11;48:13;"but Elvis couldn't do what Eminem does"
48:13;48:15;"That's kind of true"
48:15;48:17;"I mean Eminem's more of a writer"
48:17;48:19;"This looks like a job for me"
48:19;48:21;"So everybody just follow me"
48:21;48:23;"'Cause we need a little controversy"
48:23;48:25;"'Cause it feels so empty without me"
48:25;48:27;"I said this looks like a job for me"
48:27;48:29;"So everybody just follow me"
48:29;48:31;"'Cause we need a little controversy"
48:31;48:33;"'Cause it feels so empty without me"
48:33;48:35;"A cisket, a tasket, I go tit for tat with"
48:35;48:37;"Anybody who's talking this and that"
48:37;48:39;"Bitch Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked"
48:39;48:41;"Worse than them little limp biscuits"
48:41;48:43;"Moby, you can get stomped by Obie"
48:43;48:45;"You 36 year old boy, how did stayin' up for?"
48:45;48:47;"You don't know me, you're too old"
48:47;48:49;"Let go, it's over"
48:49;48:51;"Nobody listen to techno, now let's go"
48:51;48:53;"Just give me the signal, I'll be there"
48:53;48:55;"With a whole list full of new insults"
48:55;48:57;"I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil"
48:57;48:59;"Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol"
48:59;49:01;"But sometimes, man, it just seems"
49:01;49:03;"Everybody only wants to disgust me"
49:03;49:05;"So this must mean I'm disgusting"
49:05;49:07;"But it's just me, I'm just obscene"
49:07;49:09;"So I'm not the first king of controversy"
49:09;49:11;"I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley"
49:11;49:13;"To do black music so selfishly"
49:13;49:15;"And use it to get myself wealthy"
49:15;49:17;"There's a concept that works"
49:17;49:19;"20 million other white rappers immersed"
49:19;49:21;"But no matter how many fish in the sea"
49:21;49:23;"It'll be so empty without me"
49:23;49:25;"Now this looks like a job for me"
49:25;49:27;"So everybody just follow me"
49:27;49:29;"'Cause we need a little controversy"
49:29;49:31;"'Cause it feels so empty without me"
49:31;49:33;"I said this looks like a job for me"
49:33;49:35;"So everybody just follow me"
49:35;49:37;"'Cause we need a little controversy"
49:37;49:39;"'Cause it feels so empty without me"
49:39;49:41;"So Eminem is your Elvis"
49:41;49:43;"Did you ever have like a deep emotional connection to an Eminem song?"
49:43;49:45;"Were there times in your life"
49:45;49:47;"Where you were like, ""Oh, I'm gonna do Eminem"
49:47;49:49;"""I'm gonna do Eminem"""
49:49;49:51;"Were there times in your life where you were listening to like"
49:51;49:53;"""Lose Yourself"" like four or five times in a row"
49:53;49:55;"Just feeling deep emotions?"
49:55;49:57;"I feel like everyone has that with that song"
49:57;49:59;"But then I saw that Obama said that in an interview"
49:59;50:01;"And I've had to like"
50:01;50:03;"Distance myself away from it"
50:03;50:05;"It like kind of ruined it"
50:05;50:07;"As a hardcore Republican, that just made it feel like ""Ugh"""
50:07;50:09;"For you"
50:09;50:11;"Yeah, it just was like"
50:11;50:13;"""You know what, this is- this is-"
50:13;50:15;"Wait, what did Obama actually say?"
50:15;50:17;"I don't remember, I just remember"
50:17;50:19;"Maybe he said in his book or in an interview"
50:19;50:21;"That he said that he listens to"
50:21;50:23;"That song whenever he's going- doing like a big"
50:23;50:25;"Event or something"
50:25;50:27;"God, really?"
50:27;50:29;"Yeah"
50:29;50:31;"Are there other Eminem songs that you feel"
50:31;50:33;"That connection to?"
50:33;50:35;"Like, were you of the age where"
50:35;50:37;"When Eminem kind of came back and he was a little more serious"
50:37;50:39;"Were those the songs that really"
50:39;50:41;"Like hit you hard? Like"
50:41;50:43;"""I'm Friends With The Monster That's Under My Bed"""
50:43;50:45;"Those kind of songs?"
50:45;50:47;"I feel like, you know, a lot of the stuff from the Eminem show"
50:47;50:49;"Is the same vibe"
50:49;50:51;"Like ""Till I Collapse"""
50:51;50:53;"You know, it's all"
50:53;50:55;"The serious emotional stuff"
50:55;50:57;"Yeah, it's getting ready to go"
50:57;50:59;"Do some- you know, conquer your fears"
50:59;51:01;"But I don't hate the new stuff"
51:01;51:03;"As we've talked about before"
51:03;51:05;"I really don't"
51:05;51:07;"There's audio of Obama performing"
51:07;51:09;"This ""Lose Yourself"""
51:09;51:11;"I think I like Eminem so much"
51:11;51:13;"Not necessarily because"
51:13;51:15;"I love his music, but because"
51:15;51:17;"He's so undoubtedly"
51:17;51:19;"He's like so great"
51:19;51:21;"And yet so many people hate him and like"
51:21;51:23;"Talk s*** about him"
51:23;51:25;"And that I find"
51:25;51:27;"Comforting"
51:27;51:29;"When I needed some inspiration on the presidential campaign"
51:29;51:31;"I often turned to music"
51:31;51:33;"It was rap that got my head in the right place"
51:33;51:35;"Two songs especially"
51:35;51:37;"Jay Z's ""My First Song"""
51:37;51:39;"And Eminem's ""Lose Yourself"""
51:39;51:41;"Both were about defying the odds"
51:41;51:43;"And putting it all on the line"
51:43;51:45;"Look, if you had one shot"
51:45;51:47;"Or one opportunity to seize everything"
51:47;51:49;"You ever wanted in one moment"
51:49;51:51;"Would you capture it or just let it slip?"
51:51;51:53;"I just don't understand anything"
51:53;51:55;"The idea of Obama"
51:55;51:57;"Just like earnestly listening to ""Lose Yourself"""
51:57;51:59;"Hyping himself up on the campaign trail"
51:59;52:01;"Yeah, I agree with you"
52:01;52:03;"Like"
52:03;52:05;"It's so human though"
52:05;52:07;"It's like actually the most human thing I've ever heard anyone do"
52:07;52:09;"I guess just deep down"
52:09;52:11;"I thought Obama was more like"
52:11;52:13;"Like a little like weirder or something"
52:13;52:15;"Like he was gonna put on like Mozart"
52:15;52:17;"Yeah, I don't know"
52:17;52:19;"I could see if Obama would be like"
52:19;52:21;"Broken social scene"
52:21;52:23;"Not broken social scene"
52:23;52:25;"Weirder's not the right word"
52:25;52:27;"I guess more Obama was so intellectual"
52:27;52:29;"Right"
52:29;52:31;"And of course many intellectuals appreciate Eminem"
52:31;52:33;"Although that song is sometimes considered"
52:33;52:35;"One of his cornier ones"
52:35;52:37;"I guess Obama needs to be a little folksy"
52:37;52:39;"And down to earth"
52:39;52:41;"I guess I had some impression that he'd be like"
52:41;52:43;"You know when I was getting ready to debate"
52:43;52:45;"John McCain"
52:45;52:47;"I threw on John Coltrane"
52:47;52:49;"A love supreme"
52:49;52:51;"It takes me to a place where I felt ready"
52:51;52:53;"Yeah, you'd almost think like George W. Bush"
52:53;52:55;"Would be listening to ""Lose Yourself"" or something"
52:55;52:57;"Right"
52:57;52:59;"No, he'd be listening to Elvis"
52:59;53:01;"The original Eminem"
53:01;53:03;"We've determined that Obama's like a Peloton guy"
53:03;53:05;"Feels very Peloton"
53:05;53:07;"Remember when I came on the show and I said"
53:07;53:09;"It's so funny I thought that you guys were on the air still"
53:09;53:11;"And you just didn't want to have me as a guest"
53:11;53:13;"But actually you were off the air"
53:13;53:15;"And then you said no"
53:15;53:17;"No, we were on the air"
53:17;53:19;"Time flies"
53:19;53:23;"Well, we hope you come back again soon Cassie"
53:23;53:25;"We're gonna, gotta get back into Elvis world"
53:25;53:27;"Yeah, please do"
53:27;53:29;"I can't help you with that"
53:29;53:31;"Will you"
53:31;53:33;"Seinfeld will text you"
53:33;53:35;"The beautiful Elvis song ""Can't Help Falling In Love With You"""
53:35;53:37;"Will you listen to it a couple times"
53:37;53:39;"And you can report back soon"
53:39;53:41;"About if you felt any deep Eminem type emotions"
53:41;53:43;"Listening to that"
53:43;53:45;"Just gorgeous song"
53:45;53:47;"Yeah, I'll give you my thoughts"
53:47;53:49;"Okay, thank you"
53:49;53:51;"Thanks you guys"
53:51;53:53;"Thanks for coming on, peace"
53:53;53:55;"Bye"
53:55;53:57;"If you had"
53:57;53:59;"One shot"
53:59;54:01;"One opportunity"
54:01;54:03;"To seize everything you ever wanted"
54:03;54:05;"One moment"
54:05;54:07;"That you captured"
54:07;54:09;"Just let it slip"
54:09;54:11;"Yo"
54:11;54:13;"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy"
54:13;54:15;"There's vomit on his sweater already"
54:15;54:17;"Mom's spaghetti, he's nervous"
54:17;54:19;"But on the circus he looks calm and ready"
54:19;54:21;"To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting"
54:21;54:23;"What he wrote down"
54:23;54:25;"The whole crowd goes so loud"
54:25;54:27;"He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out"
54:27;54:29;"He's choking, how?"
54:29;54:31;"Everybody's choking now, the clocks run out"
54:31;54:33;"Time's up, over, plow"
54:33;54:35;"Snap back to reality"
54:35;54:37;"Oh, there goes gravity, oh, there goes gravity"
54:37;54:39;"Choke, he's so mad, but he won't"
54:39;54:41;"Give up that easy, no, he won't have it"
54:41;54:43;"He knows his whole back's to these ropes"
54:43;54:45;"It don't matter, he's dope"
54:45;54:47;"He knows that, but he's pro, he's so stacked"
54:47;54:49;"And he knows when he goes back to this mobile home"
54:49;54:51;"That's when it's back to the lab again"
54:51;54:53;"Yo, this old rap shit, he better go capture this moment"
54:53;54:55;"And hope it don't go to waste"
54:55;54:57;"You better lose yourself in the music"
54:57;54:59;"The moment you own it, you better never let it go"
54:59;55:01;"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
55:01;55:03;"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime"
55:03;55:05;"You better lose yourself in the music"
55:05;55:07;"The moment you own it, you better never let it go"
55:07;55:09;"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
55:09;55:11;"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime"
55:11;55:13;"You better lose yourself in the music"
55:13;55:15;"The moment you own it, you better never let it go"
55:15;55:17;"You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow"
55:17;55:19;"This opportunity comes once in a lifetime"
55:19;55:21;"You better lose yourself in the music"
55:21;55:23;"The moment you own it, you better never let it go"
55:23;55:25;"That's right actually, the uh"
55:25;55:27;"We talked about that on the show once"
55:27;55:29;"Well, it was our first dance"
55:29;55:31;"After the actual marriage ceremony"
55:31;55:33;"At the reception"
55:33;55:35;"First dance, it was ""The Wonder of You"""
55:35;55:37;"Which is a blistering two minute song"
55:37;55:39;"So many Elvis songs are two minutes"
55:39;55:41;"What era of Elvis?"
55:41;55:43;"This is like late"
55:43;55:45;"70s"
55:45;55:47;"Yeah, mid 70s"
55:47;55:49;"That full like Vegas orchestration"
55:49;55:51;"Yeah"
55:51;55:53;"When no one else can understand me"
55:53;55:55;"When everything I envision"
55:55;55:57;"Oh, you danced to the live version?"
55:57;55:59;"Yeah"
55:59;56:01;"I don't know, I think this was like a canned"
56:01;56:03;"Fake applause"
56:03;56:05;"Fake live"
56:05;56:07;"That's funny to dance to a live version"
56:07;56:09;"Just like ""Wah!"""
56:09;56:11;"Stage banter"
56:11;56:13;"There's a great James Burton guitar solo in this"
56:13;56:15;"""Everything I envision"""
56:19;56:21;"""Everything I do"""
56:23;56:25;"""As the wonder"""
56:27;56:29;"""The wonder of you"""
56:31;56:33;"I suggested it, I remember it was"
56:33;56:35;"The day of the wedding"
56:35;56:37;"I was like, oh we need like a first song"
56:37;56:39;"I was like, what about ""Wonder of You"" Elvis"
56:39;56:41;"Hannah was like, yeah sure"
56:41;56:43;"I was like, do you know that song? She's like, no I don't know it"
56:43;56:45;"We actually talked about this on air"
56:45;56:47;"Hannah said that she'd never heard it"
56:47;56:49;"She's game"
56:49;56:51;"Trooper"
56:51;56:53;"What do you think if you"
56:53;56:55;"Perform this live?"
56:55;56:57;"Jake jumps up with the wedding band"
56:57;56:59;"I mean it's a beautiful sentiment"
56:59;57:01;"It's a very getting married sentiment"
57:01;57:03;"I love this"
57:03;57:05;"Mid 70's Elvis sound"
57:05;57:07;"My first dance was to ""Yoga is as yoga does"""
57:07;57:09;"""Yoga is as yoga does"""
57:09;57:11;"""The wonder of you"""
57:15;57:34;"At this moment, Jake definitely pushed Hannah away and just had to air guitar the solo."
57:34;58:04;"It was pretty obvious, but maybe worth saying."
58:04;58:17;"Do you know the song ""Good Time Johnny's Got the Blues""?"
58:17;58:23;"I got really into this record that came out maybe ten years ago of these live sessions"
58:23;58:25;"he did in Memphis in '73."
58:25;58:29;"This is one of my favorites."
58:29;58:36;"'70s Elvis guy."
58:36;58:45;"I'm looking at the album cover and it says ""Elvis"" up top and I just can't help but see"
58:45;58:58;"Elvis, the wise dwarf."
58:58;59:15;"So this is a guy in some small town, everybody's leaving him, he's moving to LA."
59:15;59:16;"Yeah, I think so."
59:16;59:32;"He's got a great position."
59:32;59:53;"This record's cool because there's multiple versions of the songs and you can hear the"
59:53;59:55;"count-ins, they're live."
59:55;01:00:02;"It's like a ten-person band tracking live in the studio."
01:00:02;01:00:12;"So ""Good Time Charlie"" is a party boy."
01:00:12;01:00:14;"He's 33 now."
01:00:14;01:00:15;"Not a kid at 33."
01:00:15;01:00:16;"Time to hang it up."
01:00:16;01:00:23;"He was maybe the king of his small city, small town, partying like crazy."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"He grew up, moved to LA."
01:00:25;01:00:28;"I always love that line."
01:00:28;01:00:33;"Everybody moves away, said they're moving to LA."
01:00:33;01:00:55;"Yeah, there's a pedal steel and a B-bender, like trading licks."
01:00:55;01:00:56;"Some gotta win, some gotta lose."
01:00:56;01:00:57;"Good time Charlie's got the blues."
01:00:57;01:01:08;"God, that really is a sad image of a good time Charlie getting the blues."
01:01:08;01:01:15;"It's sort of like the Frank the Tank character in the film Old School."
01:01:15;01:01:19;"The Will Ferrell character, all his buddies are like, they all kind of grew up."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"They left."
01:01:20;01:01:25;"I guess Frank is married and lives in a nice house in that movie."
01:01:25;01:01:27;"There's a version where he doesn't."
01:01:27;01:01:31;"Even Charlie seems to be married because he says you might lose your wife."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"But back then everybody was married."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"It's almost meaningless."
01:01:34;01:01:38;"You'd be married, one person's married with kids, another person's married going out getting"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"like tanked every night."
01:01:40;01:01:42;"You know, it's like having a girlfriend."
01:01:42;01:01:46;"Everyone got married when they were like 20."
01:01:46;01:01:49;"Right, so whoever your girlfriend was when you were 20, you got married to."
01:01:49;01:01:54;"But the image of the, it's a little bit like Pagliacci, the sad clown."
01:01:54;01:01:59;"I can think of moments in my life where I've maybe seen that character."
01:01:59;01:02:04;"Because I think there are these people, like a true good time Charlie, super extroverted,"
01:02:04;01:02:06;"always like putting together the party."
01:02:06;01:02:11;"People are great to know and in a way very giving people because yes, they love to party,"
01:02:11;01:02:14;"but also they love to make a party."
01:02:14;01:02:19;"And they invite people and they get things going and they live for Thursday through Saturday"
01:02:19;01:02:23;"night and they have an infectious enthusiasm."
01:02:23;01:02:26;"But sometimes you catch that type of person."
01:02:26;01:02:30;"It's almost like seeing a teacher at a school, seeing a good time Charlie on like a Monday"
01:02:30;01:02:31;"morning."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"Yeah."
01:02:32;01:02:35;"Just like, damn good time Charlie."
01:02:35;01:02:38;"You know, you don't look the same when it's not Saturday night."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"Just yeah, like a little bit."
01:02:39;01:02:43;"You can see they pay a price for partying so hard and for giving so much of their energy"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"and enthusiasm to the people around them."
01:02:45;01:02:46;"It's not an easy life."
01:02:46;01:02:50;"So if you have a good time Charlie in your life, checking on them during the week, truly."
01:02:50;01:02:53;"Yeah, like a Tuesday morning phone call."
01:02:53;01:02:56;"What's up Charlie?"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"He's just like standing in line at the bank."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"Nobody's calling good time Charlie on Tuesday."
01:03:00;01:03:02;"At best, maybe Wednesday afternoon."
01:03:02;01:03:05;"What's on deck for the weekend?"
01:03:05;01:03:06;"Sunday through Tuesday."
01:03:06;01:03:09;"We getting a keg or what bro?"
01:03:09;01:03:10;"Dark times."
01:03:10;01:03:13;"And this one's especially sad because it's not just a good time."
01:03:13;01:03:17;"A good time Charlie might get a taste of that."
01:03:17;01:03:20;"Maybe when they're young and they're in their teens and twenties, they might get a taste"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"of that Monday morning at the bank thing."
01:03:22;01:03:25;"But this is when they're 33."
01:03:25;01:03:26;"That's the Monday morning of your whole life."
01:03:26;01:03:29;"You're not a kid at 33."
01:03:29;01:03:35;"People often describe life in terms of seasons."
01:03:35;01:03:39;"Like when I was 17, like when you're young, it's spring and summer and then it's like,"
01:03:39;01:03:42;"and then you get old and I'm in the autumn of my life."
01:03:42;01:03:47;"It's also funny to think about describing life like a week."
01:03:47;01:03:49;"I don't know exactly how you do it."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"I feel like midweek right now."
01:03:51;01:03:56;"Like when you're a kid, it's like, when you're a kid, it's Thursday."
01:03:56;01:03:57;"Like it's kind of tight, but then."
01:03:57;01:03:58;"Oh, you're starting it."
01:03:58;01:04:01;"You're starting it like on Thursday."
01:04:01;01:04:03;"Like when you're born, it's a Thursday."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"When you're born, you're on a Thursday."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"Just like, it's not even the weekend yet."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"You got nothing but the weekend in front of you."
01:04:08;01:04:09;"I see."
01:04:09;01:04:10;"You got all the time in the world."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"On a Thursday, you do have all the time in the world."
01:04:12;01:04:13;"You know what I mean?"
01:04:13;01:04:18;"And then when you're finally hit adulthood, young adulthood, whatever you want to call"
01:04:18;01:04:23;"it, the real fun times, depending on what, you know, what road your life takes."
01:04:23;01:04:29;"But then it's like Friday, Saturday is your glory years."
01:04:29;01:04:31;"Like Friday is really starting to cook."
01:04:31;01:04:32;"Saturday's your glory years."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"Sunday, things are like cooling off a bit."
01:04:34;01:04:37;"And then you get Sunday evening, man."
01:04:37;01:04:38;"Sunday evening."
01:04:38;01:04:39;"That's the midlife crisis."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"Sunday evening is the midlife crisis."
01:04:41;01:04:46;"And then, and here's the thing, like with all midlife crises, either you come out of"
01:04:46;01:04:51;"it, wake up on Monday morning and say, look at the Monday morning sun and say, thank you,"
01:04:51;01:04:53;"Lord, for giving me another day on this beautiful earth."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"The Monday morning sun."
01:04:55;01:04:59;"I'm going to make the most of my next three days."
01:04:59;01:05:05;"Or you come out of that Sunday night midlife crisis and Monday just, and then it's just"
01:05:05;01:05:09;"dark and all you're just dreaming about the weekend past."
01:05:09;01:05:15;"I guess in this version, then you die on hump day, Wednesday."
01:05:15;01:05:18;"And then I guess if you're reincarnated, you come back on Thursday."
01:05:18;01:05:23;"Oh, do it all again."
01:05:23;01:05:26;"Re reincarnation."
01:05:26;01:05:28;"You're reincarnated as like a toad."
01:05:28;01:05:29;"Yeah."
01:05:29;01:05:30;"The toad has no concept of the weekend."
01:05:30;01:05:31;"Yeah."
01:05:31;01:05:32;"It depends how you lived your life."
01:05:32;01:05:35;"Right."
01:05:35;01:05:39;"And then you have to go through many, maybe thousands, tens of thousands of lives to make"
01:05:39;01:05:41;"your way back to being a human."
01:05:41;01:05:43;"When you even have a sense of the weekend."
01:05:43;01:05:45;"Imagine if you had to cycle through every animal."
01:05:45;01:05:47;"I think that happens on planet earth."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"I think it happens to some people."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"Before you're a human again."
01:05:49;01:05:51;"Careful about how you live your life, folks."
01:05:51;01:05:54;"You could start even below a toad is the truth."
01:05:54;01:05:55;"Single celled organism."
01:05:55;01:05:56;"Yeah."
01:05:56;01:05:57;"Stone."
01:05:57;01:06:00;"I think there's consciousness in all things."
01:06:00;01:06:01;"Damn."
01:06:01;01:06:03;"You know, one thing I want to look at real quick with Elvis."
01:06:03;01:06:07;"Jake, can you picture like the first Elvis album?"
01:06:07;01:06:08;"The cover?"
01:06:08;01:06:09;"No, I don't know."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"I think you'd recognize."
01:06:10;01:06:11;"Let me show it to you."
01:06:11;01:06:14;"It's the one that the Clash London Calling is a riff on."
01:06:14;01:06:16;"It's just called Elvis Presley."
01:06:16;01:06:19;"And it's like, it's such a good cover."
01:06:19;01:06:21;"It's this one where it says Elvis in pink."
01:06:21;01:06:22;"Oh, okay."
01:06:22;01:06:23;"Yeah."
01:06:23;01:06:24;"Elvis in pink."
01:06:24;01:06:27;"So it's this like cool picture of Elvis with an acoustic guitar, his mouth wide open, like"
01:06:27;01:06:29;"he's strumming and he's singing."
01:06:29;01:06:32;"He looks super cool, young and vibrant."
01:06:32;01:06:33;"What's on that?"
01:06:33;01:06:37;"Because I don't think of him as like an, or that era of rock is really like an album."
01:06:37;01:06:40;"But it kind of, in some ways, this is one of like the first real hit albums."
01:06:40;01:06:42;"Like Hound Dog?"
01:06:42;01:06:43;"So track one."
01:06:43;01:06:44;"On the self title, Out the Gates."
01:06:44;01:06:45;"Everybody at home, look up the first Elvis album."
01:06:45;01:06:46;"It's called Elvis Presley."
01:06:46;01:06:47;"It's just cool design."
01:06:47;01:06:48;"Black and white photo, pink Elvis, green Presley."
01:06:48;01:06:49;"And what's on the cover?"
01:06:49;01:07:00;"So this is 1956."
01:07:00;01:07:20;"This is one of the first like true pop albums where you're just like, Out the Gate."
01:07:20;01:07:48;"Something"
01:07:48;01:07:53;"about looking at this record and then really thinking about this came out in 1956."
01:07:53;01:07:57;"Because you know, like people our age and people didn't grow up with any of this stuff,"
01:07:57;01:08:00;"but are kind of like into music and aware of it."
01:08:00;01:08:05;"Sometimes there's that really intense reverence that like the 60s people talk about Elvis"
01:08:05;01:08:09;"with, which I always felt like a tiny bit hard to understand."
01:08:09;01:08:12;"Just in the sense that, you know, when you're young, you're just like Elvis, the Beatles,"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"like yeah, it's the same era."
01:08:14;01:08:18;"But then you think about this, like he was just popping in the mid fifties."
01:08:18;01:08:22;"They were like, so these guys were like really young hearing this otherworldly music."
01:08:22;01:08:27;"And then maybe it took them about six, seven, eight years to kind of really craft their"
01:08:27;01:08:28;"version of it."
01:08:28;01:08:29;"Yeah."
01:08:29;01:08:30;"When I look at it that way, I understand it better."
01:08:30;01:08:35;"But one song that I listen to on this album sometimes is track 11."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"And so this is all covers."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"There's Blue Suede Shoes."
01:08:38;01:08:41;"There's the Ray Charles, I Got a Woman."
01:08:41;01:08:51;"And you just think about how like raucous and like simple and raw the album is."
01:08:51;01:08:57;"But then also like technologically advanced with like the slapback on the vocals."
01:08:57;01:08:58;"Like it's weird."
01:08:58;01:09:15;", yeah."
01:09:15;01:09:34;"But the one that really gets me, track 11, his version of Blue Moon."
01:09:34;01:09:35;"Oh yeah."
01:09:35;01:09:38;"Because you listen to this and you're just like, this is weird."
01:09:38;01:09:40;"This is like alien music."
01:09:40;01:09:43;"And you can just picture hearing shit like this for the first time."
01:09:43;01:09:47;"Like suicide."
01:09:47;01:09:50;"I mean, it is suicide."
01:09:50;01:09:54;"Everything like weird and deconstructionist and rock."
01:09:54;01:09:56;"It's really just going back to the source."
01:09:56;01:10:00;"It's not even, you know what I mean?"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"Yeah."
01:10:02;01:10:03;"Is that just like a palm muted guitar?"
01:10:03;01:10:04;"I think so."
01:10:04;01:10:05;"With a ton of reverb."
01:10:05;01:10:10;"I mean, in a way this is like electronic music."
01:10:10;01:10:21;"When you consider that's what they were using to create these sounds."
01:10:21;01:10:26;"I can really picture just like in 1956, looking at this album cover and listening to this"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"and just being like, what is this?"
01:10:28;01:10:35;"We're in a different universe now."
01:10:35;01:10:53;"It's so sick."
01:10:53;01:10:56;"I wonder how they arrived at this, if they had done versions that were..."
01:10:56;01:10:59;"If there's ever just like a dry vocal or something."
01:10:59;01:11:00;"Or just like more fully arranged."
01:11:00;01:11:05;"It reminds me a little bit of like Something in the Way, the Nirvana song."
01:11:05;01:11:10;"I remember reading about that and they had tried versions that were more, you know, at"
01:11:10;01:11:15;"a normal volume and they just kept getting quieter and quieter until he was finally just"
01:11:15;01:11:18;"like something in the way."
01:11:18;01:11:24;"Like singing so quietly to get the effect."
01:11:24;01:11:29;"Anyway."
01:11:29;01:11:30;"It's so restrained."
01:11:30;01:11:31;"Yeah, truly."
01:11:32;01:11:37;"And probably there must have already been a lot of versions of Blue Moon out there that"
01:11:37;01:11:38;"were just so much bigger."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"Is that him doing that?"
01:11:39;01:11:40;"I think it's him."
01:11:40;01:11:41;"It does kind of sound like a woman."
01:11:41;01:11:42;"Haunting."
01:11:42;01:11:43;"Very haunting."
01:11:43;01:12:12;"Technologically advanced electronic music from Elvis Presley."
01:12:13;01:12:18;"Now there's so much we could say about the real Elvis, and perhaps we will after we see"
01:12:18;01:12:19;"the movie."
01:12:19;01:12:22;"We could do a tribute to the film."
01:12:22;01:12:26;"But one thing about Elvis is that he spawned many imitators."
01:12:26;01:12:29;"And to this day there's still many Elvis impersonators."
01:12:29;01:12:35;"And I once heard a legendary story about one such impersonator named Extreme Elvis."
01:12:35;01:12:39;"But we gotta hear the story from somebody who's actually on the scene."
01:12:39;01:12:45;"So let's get longtime friend of the show, TC Hall of Famer, Despot, on the line."
01:12:53;01:12:59;"[applause]"
01:13:05;01:13:13;"[applause]"
01:13:33;01:13:53;"[applause]"
01:13:56;01:13:57;"Alec."
01:13:57;01:13:58;"Yeah."
01:13:58;01:14:00;"Welcome back to Time Crisis."
01:14:00;01:14:01;"Thanks."
01:14:01;01:14:03;"Okay, first question."
01:14:03;01:14:06;"I'm remembering this correctly, but you're a big Roger Miller fan, correct?"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"Yeah, I love Roger Miller."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"What got you into Roger Miller?"
01:14:10;01:14:13;"I guess Robin Hood, but also like..."
01:14:13;01:14:14;"Oh, right."
01:14:14;01:14:18;"Yeah, my dad was also like big Roger Miller guy."
01:14:18;01:14:19;"He used to play."
01:14:19;01:14:22;"My uncle used to love me, but she died in the car a lot."
01:14:22;01:14:24;"My uncle used to love me, but she died?"
01:14:24;01:14:27;"Yeah, that's a big Roger Miller hit."
01:14:27;01:14:32;"And ""You Can't Roller Skate in a Buffalo Herd"" was another big one."
01:14:32;01:14:37;"I forgot that Roger Miller did all the songs in the Disney Robin Hood, the cartoon."
01:14:37;01:14:38;"Yeah."
01:14:38;01:14:39;"The Fox Robin Hood."
01:14:39;01:14:40;"That's right."
01:14:40;01:14:43;"Do you know the Roger Miller song ""Reincarnation""?"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"Yeah, I do."
01:14:45;01:14:48;"His thing was that they're always like a little bit funny."
01:14:48;01:14:50;"Yeah, he's a silly guy."
01:14:50;01:14:52;"Not all of them, but yeah, most of them."
01:14:52;01:14:55;"And ""King of the Road,"" that's kind of like his signature song?"
01:14:55;01:14:56;"Yeah, that's a big one."
01:14:56;01:14:59;"All right, well, I just wanted to double check that you're a huge Roger Miller fan,"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"but mostly we were talking about Elvis today."
01:15:01;01:15:02;"Okay."
01:15:02;01:15:04;"I don't know if I'm a huge Elvis fan."
01:15:04;01:15:06;"Do you have like a favorite Elvis song?"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"I don't think so."
01:15:08;01:15:10;"Uh..."
01:15:10;01:15:11;"""In the Ghetto""?"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"That is a pretty good song."
01:15:13;01:15:15;"Well, the main thing that we wanted to hear about today, though,"
01:15:15;01:15:18;"because we don't know anybody who spent any time with Elvis,"
01:15:18;01:15:22;"but I know that you spent some time with extreme Elvis."
01:15:22;01:15:23;"I did."
01:15:23;01:15:25;"I spent some extreme time with him."
01:15:26;01:15:32;"So, by the way, we wanted to see if we could also get extreme Elvis on the show."
01:15:32;01:15:33;"Nobody can find him."
01:15:33;01:15:36;"I think I still have his guitarist phone number."
01:15:36;01:15:38;"I could try."
01:15:38;01:15:39;"Oh, maybe you should try for next time."
01:15:39;01:15:43;"But first, I just want to hear the story straight."
01:15:43;01:15:48;"So tell us about how you met extreme Elvis and also just like who he is."
01:15:48;01:15:53;"When I was attending SUNY Purchase College, I was the--"
01:15:53;01:15:56;"This is, I don't know, like 2002 maybe."
01:15:56;01:16:00;"I was what is called the general events coordinator."
01:16:00;01:16:03;"No, the major events coordinator. Sorry."
01:16:03;01:16:09;"And what the major events coordinator did was put together this thing called Culture Shock"
01:16:09;01:16:11;"in the spring every year."
01:16:11;01:16:16;"And I was the only one who was like consecutively voted back in a few times"
01:16:16;01:16:19;"because I put on really good shows."
01:16:19;01:16:25;"And I renamed it to Vulture C*ck because everyone hated the president."
01:16:25;01:16:26;"And he really didn't like that."
01:16:26;01:16:28;"They hated the president of the college?"
01:16:28;01:16:29;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:16:29;01:16:33;"The president of the United States didn't know about Vulture C*ck."
01:16:33;01:16:38;"That was George W. Bush back then."
01:16:38;01:16:40;"Yeah, that sounds right."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"It was right after 9/11."
01:16:42;01:16:44;"Right. Getting ready to go to war in Iraq."
01:16:44;01:16:45;"That's right."
01:16:45;01:16:46;"Great time."
01:16:46;01:16:52;"So I was on student government there with Dan Deacon,"
01:16:52;01:16:56;"who is an electronic musician and a friend of mine."
01:16:56;01:17:04;"And we had a lot of crazy ideas that we used the student body's money to execute."
01:17:04;01:17:08;"And also just to have some context, in the years leading up to the Extreme Elvis one,"
01:17:08;01:17:12;"what type of people were you bringing to the event?"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"I don't know. There was a lot of sh*t."
01:17:14;01:17:20;"I had Ghostface and MF Doom, but I also had Cat Power, Blonde Redhead,"
01:17:20;01:17:26;"and Davenger Banheart, Animal Collective, The Locust, Pig Destroyer."
01:17:26;01:17:28;"Right. So these are really good builds."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"Yeah, it was good."
01:17:29;01:17:31;"Up at SUNY Purchase."
01:17:31;01:17:33;"Yeah, we had good shows."
01:17:33;01:17:36;"Joanna Newsom even, with her harp and sh*t."
01:17:36;01:17:38;"Oh, so you were getting people real early in their careers too."
01:17:38;01:17:39;"Yeah, that was the idea."
01:17:39;01:17:43;"I think I paid Animal Collective like 500 bucks or something."
01:17:43;01:17:44;"Wow."
01:17:44;01:17:46;"Yeah, it was early."
01:17:46;01:17:50;"And they had Ariel Pink on tour with them and they asked if they could bring him."
01:17:50;01:17:53;"They sent me a demo because no one had ever heard of him."
01:17:53;01:17:55;"And I was like, ""No, I don't like this."""
01:17:55;01:17:57;"So he was like..."
01:17:57;01:18:01;"So you're gearing up for another vulture c*nt."
01:18:01;01:18:05;"Yeah, and Dan Deacon was really into this band called The Locust."
01:18:05;01:18:07;"And he was like, ""You gotta book The Locust."""
01:18:07;01:18:10;"And I was like, ""Yeah, they're cool. I'll do it."""
01:18:10;01:18:13;"I guess, I think it was The Locust at least."
01:18:13;01:18:14;"My memory could be off."
01:18:14;01:18:17;"But they had a DVD that they put out."
01:18:17;01:18:21;"And at the beginning of the DVD was some Extreme Elvis footage."
01:18:21;01:18:24;"And he was like, ""You gotta check out this guy Extreme Elvis."
01:18:24;01:18:27;"He gets naked, sings Elvis songs."""
01:18:27;01:18:28;"And whatever."
01:18:28;01:18:30;"And I was like, ""Oh, sounds great."""
01:18:30;01:18:33;"And so I watched some of this sh*t."
01:18:33;01:18:36;"And I was like, ""Yeah, this guy has to be here."""
01:18:36;01:18:41;"There was like a... I guess on his website there was an email or a number or something."
01:18:41;01:18:44;"And I reached out and they were like, ""Yeah, sounds great."""
01:18:44;01:18:46;"I don't remember how much I paid them."
01:18:46;01:18:50;"And, you know, he came with a full band."
01:18:50;01:18:51;"They were pretty good."
01:18:51;01:18:54;"He sang Elvis songs pretty well."
01:18:54;01:18:56;"He did an Elvis impression."
01:18:56;01:18:58;"How old was he? Do you have a sense of that?"
01:18:58;01:18:59;"No idea."
01:18:59;01:19:02;"He was, I mean, significantly older than me."
01:19:02;01:19:05;"So maybe he's like a 30-something..."
01:19:05;01:19:06;"Yeah."
01:19:06;01:19:07;"...guy."
01:19:07;01:19:11;"And musically, he was like a fairly straightforward Elvis impersonator."
01:19:11;01:19:12;"Yeah, yeah."
01:19:12;01:19:14;"There was not even like..."
01:19:14;01:19:19;"As far as I can remember, there weren't any like profane lyrics or any weird edits to the songs."
01:19:19;01:19:21;"It was just he was doing Elvis songs."
01:19:21;01:19:22;"He's a good band."
01:19:22;01:19:24;"He's singing like Elvis."
01:19:24;01:19:29;"And he would wear like the kind of 70s era white rhinestone jumpsuit look."
01:19:29;01:19:30;"Yes, exactly."
01:19:30;01:19:32;"But he was really fat."
01:19:32;01:19:33;"Ah."
01:19:33;01:19:35;"Yeah, so he's this fat guy."
01:19:35;01:19:38;"He's singing Elvis, you know, Elvis songs."
01:19:38;01:19:40;"You know, I had seen videos of him..."
01:19:40;01:19:41;"[bleep]"
01:19:41;01:19:42;"...and..."
01:19:42;01:19:43;"[bleep]"
01:19:43;01:19:44;"...whatever."
01:19:44;01:19:46;"And I was like, you know, I said I was like maybe don't like..."
01:19:46;01:19:47;"[bleep]"
01:19:47;01:19:48;"...but I guess he's a good..."
01:19:48;01:19:49;"[bleep]"
01:19:49;01:19:50;"And he was like, yeah, yeah."
01:19:50;01:19:51;"Okay."
01:19:51;01:19:54;"And, well, first I couldn't find him."
01:19:54;01:19:57;"When it was time for him to get on stage, his band was on stage."
01:19:57;01:19:59;"And they were like, yeah, I don't know."
01:19:59;01:20:00;"He's drunk."
01:20:00;01:20:01;"Like, I don't know where he is."
01:20:01;01:20:05;"I went like running around frantically like looking for him."
01:20:05;01:20:06;"There's an outdoor show."
01:20:06;01:20:09;"And I was running around like the area where the stage was."
01:20:09;01:20:11;"And I found him."
01:20:11;01:20:18;"He was laying on the ground like doing nitrous balloons like just on his back on the ground."
01:20:18;01:20:21;"And I was like, great, this guy isn't going to do the show."
01:20:21;01:20:26;"And then there's all these kids around him like laughing and whatever."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"And he was like, carry me."
01:20:28;01:20:32;"And they get him and they carry him on stage like on his back."
01:20:32;01:20:35;"There's like a whole bunch of kids holding him above their heads."
01:20:35;01:20:37;"And that's how he got on stage."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"They like ran him off stage."
01:20:39;01:20:40;"Yeah, he gets on stage."
01:20:40;01:20:41;"He gets up."
01:20:41;01:20:42;"He starts singing."
01:20:42;01:20:46;"He had like a baby bottle full of whiskey."
01:20:46;01:20:49;"And it's going well."
01:20:49;01:20:52;"And then he starts taking his clothes off."
01:20:52;01:20:57;"And people are like, you know, nobody really knew that this is what was going to happen."
01:20:57;01:21:00;"They're not like familiar with the extreme Elvis."
01:21:00;01:21:01;"So now he's naked."
01:21:01;01:21:05;"He has a really small [bleep] that's like part of the stick, I think."
01:21:05;01:21:08;"Like you can barely see it."
01:21:08;01:21:12;"And so he's doing all that."
01:21:12;01:21:14;"And like you start to see the reaction in the crowd."
01:21:14;01:21:17;"Like people are like, what the [bleep]"
01:21:17;01:21:18;"I don't know about this."
01:21:18;01:21:22;"And people are coming up to me because I'm like a guy who books cool [bleep]"
01:21:22;01:21:24;"And they're like, yo, what the [bleep]"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"And I was like, what do you mean?"
01:21:26;01:21:27;"He's cool."
01:21:27;01:21:28;"It's extreme Elvis."
01:21:28;01:21:30;"He's singing Elvis songs and he's naked."
01:21:30;01:21:32;"And they're like, yeah, I guess, whatever."
01:21:32;01:21:34;"Guys, he might be the next Animal Collective."
01:21:34;01:21:35;"Yeah."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"He could be the next Joanna Newsom."
01:21:37;01:21:38;"Have an open mind."
01:21:38;01:21:39;"He could have been."
01:21:39;01:21:43;"So like the most significant incident, I guess,"
01:21:43;01:21:47;"I should think first he, you know, he's naked."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"He's singing."
01:21:48;01:21:50;"He has a wireless mic so he can go wherever."
01:21:50;01:21:52;"He runs into the crowd naked."
01:21:52;01:21:55;"And he's like, you know, I don't know, hundreds of kids, thousands of kids."
01:21:55;01:21:56;"I don't know."
01:21:56;01:21:59;"He's running through them and he's [bleep]"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"He's just running, like spinning around and [bleep]"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"Oh, God."
01:22:03;01:22:08;"You know, for the most part, you know, the crowd's like parting like crazy."
01:22:08;01:22:11;"Like everywhere he goes, they just like dissipate."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"People trying to get away from him."
01:22:13;01:22:15;"And he's [bleep] singing and running."
01:22:15;01:22:17;"That must have been insanely shocking."
01:22:17;01:22:18;"Yeah."
01:22:18;01:22:19;"That definitely is crossing a line."
01:22:19;01:22:26;"That's going from kind of like, you know, weird performance art to like truly disgusting."
01:22:26;01:22:27;"Yeah, it's great."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"Biohazard."
01:22:29;01:22:33;"Also, like if you go to like a Gigi Allen show, you're expecting that."
01:22:33;01:22:34;"Right."
01:22:34;01:22:39;"But if you're just at SUNY Purchase watching an Elvis cover band."
01:22:39;01:22:45;"Wait, who is on the bill, Alec, on this show in particular after Extreme Elvis?"
01:22:45;01:22:46;"He was the opener?"
01:22:46;01:22:48;"He was pretty early on."
01:22:48;01:22:49;"I wonder, I mean."
01:22:49;01:22:51;"And then it was the Locust?"
01:22:51;01:22:52;"Nah, it was a big show."
01:22:52;01:22:53;"It was a festival."
01:22:53;01:22:57;"So if you gave me a second, I could definitely find the lineup."
01:22:57;01:23:02;"I'm curious because I want to picture that you're some SUNY Purchase student or maybe"
01:23:02;01:23:06;"just like a high school kid or just some random person."
01:23:06;01:23:07;"Oh, yeah."
01:23:07;01:23:08;"A lot of local people."
01:23:08;01:23:09;"A lot of local music fans."
01:23:09;01:23:11;"Yeah, I mean, kids from the 50s."
01:23:11;01:23:12;"Oh, wait."
01:23:12;01:23:13;"Hold on."
01:23:13;01:23:14;"Actually, Alec, I found it."
01:23:14;01:23:15;"Oh, OK."
01:23:15;01:23:18;"The opening of the Vulture C*ck SUNY Purchase."
01:23:18;01:23:20;"This was April 17th, '04."
01:23:20;01:23:22;"Yeah, that sounds right."
01:23:22;01:23:23;"Oh, there's a lot."
01:23:23;01:23:31;"OK, so the day of Extreme Elvis, you had Fresh Kills, Daniel Carter, Devendra Banhart, Smog,"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"then Extreme Elvis."
01:23:33;01:23:37;"So you had Smog going before Extreme Elvis?"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"Yeah, I guess that's what we did."
01:23:39;01:23:42;"If I ever meet Bill Callahan, I'm going to say like, ""Hey, man, you still opening for"
01:23:42;01:23:43;"Extreme Elvis?"""
01:23:43;01:23:44;"He probably remembers."
01:23:44;01:23:47;"I think I remember him being into it."
01:23:47;01:23:52;"Then after that, the Chinese stars, Pig Destroyer, Paul Madison, Jen Nugent, Mates of State,"
01:23:52;01:23:57;"Robotnica, Jean Grey, Blonde Redhead, MF Doom, Ghostface, Killa."
01:23:57;01:24:01;"Or was it just picturing like, just like some hardcore Wu-Tang fan?"
01:24:01;01:24:02;"Well, that's what it was."
01:24:02;01:24:06;"I was like, ""I want to get there really early so that we have like the perfect, I want to"
01:24:06;01:24:07;"be right up front for Ghostface."
01:24:07;01:24:08;"We're going to get there early."""
01:24:08;01:24:11;"And then you watch Extreme Elvis and you get f*cked."
01:24:11;01:24:13;"Well, that's what I was going to say."
01:24:13;01:24:14;"There was tons of that."
01:24:14;01:24:16;"There were all these kids who came to see Ghost and Doom."
01:24:16;01:24:20;"There was like, you know, like kids from Long Island with the Wu-Tang symbol shaved into"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"their head and like sh*t like that."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"And they're there."
01:24:24;01:24:29;"And then like, you know, the cops on campus at a state college are state troopers."
01:24:29;01:24:31;"They're like real cops."
01:24:31;01:24:36;"And they start obviously to like get pissed off and they come up to me and they're like,"
01:24:36;01:24:37;"""Hey, who is this guy?"""
01:24:37;01:24:40;"And I'm like, ""Uh, you know, he's Extreme Elvis."
01:24:40;01:24:42;"This is like his act."""
01:24:42;01:24:45;"You know, it's like performance art or whatever."
01:24:45;01:24:48;"It's very cool stuff that's happening."
01:24:48;01:24:50;"And they're like, ""Okay."""
01:24:50;01:24:52;"You're just like, ""Stand down, officers."
01:24:52;01:24:53;"This is performance art."""
01:24:53;01:24:54;"Yeah."
01:24:54;01:24:55;"It's protected."
01:24:55;01:24:56;"It's protected speech."
01:24:56;01:24:57;"I mean, yes."
01:24:57;01:25:00;"That was how we pitched it because we did have to..."
01:25:00;01:25:01;"You didn't know."
01:25:01;01:25:03;"You thought he might be getting naked and being wild."
01:25:03;01:25:08;"I mean, I told him I'd rather he didn't f*ck some people, but I kind of thought he would."
01:25:08;01:25:13;"We had to clear all this sh*t with D because they had to get online and look at each act."
01:25:13;01:25:17;"So for him, of course, we were like, ""Yeah, it's performance art, but he can tone it down."""
01:25:17;01:25:18;"I'm like, ""Whatever."""
01:25:18;01:25:20;"So they're like, ""That's cool."
01:25:20;01:25:22;"We just want to talk to him when he's done."
01:25:22;01:25:24;"So can you bring us over to him when he gets off stage?"""
01:25:24;01:25:26;"And I was like, ""Yeah, I guess."""
01:25:26;01:25:28;"So I went up on stage."
01:25:28;01:25:33;"I pulled one of his guys aside and I was like, ""Yo, I feel like the cops are going to arrest him as soon as he gets off stage."
01:25:33;01:25:35;"So get him out of here when you're done."""
01:25:35;01:25:37;"And they were like, ""Okay, yeah."""
01:25:37;01:25:40;"And I'm sure this happens all the time."
01:25:40;01:25:43;"They were just like, ""Yeah, okay. One of these."""
01:25:43;01:25:48;"He gets off stage and he puts on a robe and he comes right over to me."
01:25:48;01:25:51;"And he's like, ""I'm going to get under this table."""
01:25:51;01:25:56;"And it was a card table where someone was selling stuff, but it had a tablecloth on it."
01:25:56;01:26:00;"So I don't know, he gets under the table and he hides behind the tablecloth."
01:26:00;01:26:03;"And the cops come up to me and they're like, ""Hey, where is he?"""
01:26:03;01:26:06;"And he's right next to me under the table."
01:26:06;01:26:08;"And I was like, ""I don't know."""
01:26:08;01:26:11;"And they were like, ""Well, we need to talk to him."""
01:26:11;01:26:15;"And I was like, ""All right. When I see him, I'll let you know."""
01:26:15;01:26:17;"And they were like, ""Okay."""
01:26:17;01:26:20;"And he was lifting up the tablecloth and smiling at me."
01:26:20;01:26:23;"And I was just like, ""Man, this is weird."""
01:26:23;01:26:25;"And they never found him."
01:26:25;01:26:30;"He got out from under the table eventually and he went into the dorms."
01:26:30;01:26:33;"And he took a bath in a communal bathroom."
01:26:33;01:26:38;"And people hung out with him while he was taking a bath and drinking."
01:26:38;01:26:39;"I mean, that's it."
01:26:39;01:26:41;"[Rapping]"
01:26:50;01:26:53;"Suns chiflin' Wildflower on a cyclin'"
01:26:53;01:26:58;"Picked up the broom, thought I was michelin' West Brighton pool, now I'm into Iron Duels"

01:27:39;01:27:44;"Shake that body, party that body Don't f*ck with ghosts and feel sorry"
01:27:44;01:27:49;"That's word, I'm not the herb Understand what I'm sayin', sayin', sayin'?"
01:27:49;01:27:53;"I'm mice like Jake Chappell, right down the middle with the Eiffel Tower"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"He's gotten quiet in recent years?"
01:27:55;01:27:58;"Would you follow, keep up with Extreme Elvis news after that?"
01:27:58;01:28:04;"Yeah, I mean, yeah, once in a while I would like Google and see what he was up to"
01:28:04;01:28:08;"And there was a point where his website was just a big FBI notice that was like"
01:28:08;01:28:11;"It's still up It is?"
01:28:11;01:28:14;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty hardcore"
01:28:14;01:28:15;"Yeah, but is it real?"
01:28:15;01:28:19;"Is that, like, or did he just put that up 'cause, you know, he was being"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"'Cause he's a performance artist Exactly"
01:28:21;01:28:25;"Anyway, yeah, I don't know, he, like, he hasn't posted anything on his website"
01:28:25;01:28:28;"Since, like, 2002 or 3, I think"
01:28:28;01:28:33;"Oh yeah, his website says it's been permanently shut down by the Federal Bureau of Investigation"
01:28:33;01:28:34;"Yeah, I don't know Yeah, I think you're probably right"
01:28:34;01:28:39;"I think he put that up probably to make things seem more mysterious"
01:28:39;01:28:42;"And was there a subsequent blowback on campus?"
01:28:42;01:28:45;"Did you have to go talk to the president of SUNY Purchase?"
01:28:45;01:28:49;"Yeah, they were mad, they were like, you know, I don't know, we did so much worse there"
01:28:49;01:28:52;"That it almost, like, I don't know, it kind of blew over"
01:28:52;01:28:56;"And they were pissed, they were like, he didn't tell us it was gonna be like that"
01:28:56;01:28:59;"And I was like, yeah, sorry, that was it really"
01:28:59;01:29:04;"I mean, we had, like, we booked this band called Bad Luck 13 once"
01:29:04;01:29:09;"They wrapped baseball bats in barbed wire and set them on fire and attacked the crowd"
01:29:09;01:29:13;"So that was, we were like"
01:29:13;01:29:16;"Wow, early 2000s, very confrontational time"
01:29:16;01:29:19;"Yeah, they ended up burning down the venue that they played in"
01:29:19;01:29:22;"Wait, what?"
01:29:22;01:29:26;"They did, it was called Amputee Center, it was called The Cave, yeah"
01:29:26;01:29:27;"They burnt down The Cave"
01:29:27;01:29:30;"Because they just, like, rolled in with, like, gasoline and torches?"
01:29:30;01:29:33;"Yeah, they were hit, there was, like, arcade machines in there"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"And they were smashing them with the flaming bats"
01:29:35;01:29:38;"And then they were, like, smashing everything else with the flaming bats"
01:29:38;01:29:40;"And then everything was on fire"
01:29:40;01:29:41;"What kind of music were they?"
01:29:41;01:29:44;"They were, like, a hardcore band, Bad Luck 13"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"If you look it up, all their shows are like that"
01:29:46;01:29:51;"They just, like, beat the sh*t out of the crowd, whatever"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"They should go on tour with Extreme Elvis"
01:29:53;01:29:54;"Definitely"
01:29:54;01:29:56;"Man, someone needs to make the Extreme Elvis movie"
01:29:56;01:29:57;"Yeah"
01:29:57;01:30:00;"Seriously, Harmony Corrine"
01:30:00;01:30:01;"Yeah, that's kind of perfect"
01:30:01;01:30:04;"Alright, well, thanks so much, Alec"

01:30:23;01:30:29;"Down in Elvis Presley Boulevard on Memphis Radio"
01:30:29;01:30:31;"Where the hopeless held a vigil"
01:30:31;01:30:34;"And the nameless made the charts"
01:30:34;01:30:37;"Where the losers lost their sorrow"
01:30:37;01:30:40;"And the lonely left their hearts"
01:30:40;01:30:45;"Step on these shoes and I'll see you in hell"
01:30:45;01:30:50;"Help me so tender I cry"
01:30:50;01:30:55;"Save me, Harumen, my sacred tale"
01:30:55;01:30:59;"So long as you die"
01:30:59;01:31:03;"Now we're gonna do a long-awaited catch-up with a friend of the show, Winter"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"The king of starbucking"
01:31:05;01:31:06;"The starbuck king"
01:31:06;01:31:07;"King of the road, too"
01:31:07;01:31:08;"King of the road"
01:31:08;01:31:10;"Extreme starbucker"
01:31:10;01:31:11;"This is a really Around the Horn episode"
01:31:11;01:31:12;"Yeah"
01:31:12;01:31:13;"Some oldies"
01:31:13;01:31:16;"Do you think Winter's an Elvis fan?"
01:31:16;01:31:17;"That's a tough question"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"I know he's..."
01:31:19;01:31:19;"Yes"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"I feel like Winter's not like a..."
01:31:21;01:31:22;"He likes..."
01:31:22;01:31:22;"I'm gonna say no"
01:31:22;01:31:24;"Yeah, I think he likes new stuff"
01:31:24;01:31:25;"He loves Taylor Swift"
01:31:25;01:31:26;"Yeah"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"And likes, you know, Starbucks"
01:31:28;01:31:30;"More of like a modern phenomenon"
01:31:30;01:31:32;"Elvis is so deep in the past"
01:31:32;01:31:33;"Yeah"
01:31:33;01:31:34;"Although..."
01:31:34;01:31:35;"I think he likes it"
01:31:35;01:31:35;"You think he likes those?"
01:31:35;01:31:39;"I think they play it a lot in the Starbucks around Christmas time especially"
01:31:39;01:31:40;"I bet he's..."
01:31:40;01:31:41;"I'm going pro"
01:31:41;01:31:42;"Okay, I'm going no"
01:31:43;01:31:46;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
01:31:46;01:31:52;"Hello, this is Winter"
01:31:52;01:31:52;"Winter, what's up, man?"
01:31:52;01:31:55;"Welcome back to TC"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"Hey, how are y'all doing?"
01:31:57;01:32:01;"Can you give me about two minutes to get out to the car"
01:32:01;01:32:02;"so it's not so loud?"
01:32:02;01:32:03;"Are you in a Starbucks?"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"We can hear you pretty well"
01:32:05;01:32:10;"Yes, I am literally at a Starbucks in a town that's hard to pronounce"
01:32:10;01:32:13;"Ashwaubenon or something like that"
01:32:13;01:32:18;"Wisconsin, it's basically a suburb of Green Bay"
01:32:18;01:32:23;"One of four new Starbucks to open in northern Wisconsin"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"since I was last up here last year"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"Not sure what's going on with the economy up here"
01:32:27;01:32:32;"but that's a lot of Starbucks for the population of this area"
01:32:32;01:32:34;"Business is booming"
01:32:34;01:32:35;"It is, it is"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"Good to talk to you"
01:32:37;01:32:42;"It's been a while but your timing is actually impeccable"
01:32:42;01:32:46;"I had not much going on Starbucks-wise"
01:32:46;01:32:49;"Last year, it was kind of a quiet year"
01:32:49;01:32:56;"but 2022 is turning out to be one of my biggest years ever"
01:32:56;01:32:59;"and there's a lot of Starbucking news"
01:32:59;01:33:02;"and actually a lot of general Starbucks news"
01:33:02;01:33:04;"So, great timing on the call"
01:33:04;01:33:07;"It's awesome to catch you on the road actually Starbucking"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"Give us a breakdown"
01:33:09;01:33:12;"What's some of the most important new Starbucks news?"
01:33:12;01:33:14;"Wow, there's actually so much"
01:33:14;01:33:21;"that you could even do a top 5 Starbucks news for 2022"
01:33:21;01:33:24;"The top one is probably unionization effort"
01:33:24;01:33:28;"that's been expanding and just crossed the 100 stores mark"
01:33:28;01:33:29;"Oh, I've heard that"
01:33:29;01:33:30;"Wow, 100 stores"
01:33:30;01:33:33;"But Howard Schultz says he won't talk to them or something?"
01:33:33;01:33:34;"Is that part of the story?"
01:33:34;01:33:35;"It's contentious"
01:33:35;01:33:39;"They're getting accused of union busting"
01:33:39;01:33:42;"Some of the organizers have been fired"
01:33:42;01:33:45;"Starbucks, of course, says it has nothing to do with the unionization"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"which would be illegal"
01:33:47;01:33:50;"One store in Ithaca, New York recently"
01:33:50;01:33:53;"I believe it closed maybe today"
01:33:53;01:33:55;"is their last day"
01:33:55;01:33:57;"and Starbucks says"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"we've had this in mind for a while"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"It has nothing to do with the unionization"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"Might or might not be true"
01:34:03;01:34:04;"but it looks bad"
01:34:04;01:34:05;"So that's news"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"Howard Schultz coming back to the company"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"That's a top story"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"The pullout from Russia"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"That's another top story"
01:34:13;01:34:16;"The recent announcement that they might change their bathroom policy"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"to require a purchase"
01:34:18;01:34:23;"and minor stuff like a big push for the reusable cup"
01:34:23;01:34:24;"They're actually giving you"
01:34:24;01:34:26;"in addition to a 10 cent discount"
01:34:26;01:34:28;"they're giving you 25 bonus stars"
01:34:28;01:34:30;"What that translates to is"
01:34:30;01:34:32;"every third coffee is free"
01:34:32;01:34:37;"because a coffee costs 50 bonus stars"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"You're just handing them a kind of a"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"like a thermos or something?"
01:34:41;01:34:42;"That's right"
01:34:42;01:34:47;"I purchased a tall size metal tumbler or mug"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"It's more like a tumbler"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"and as long as it's clean"
01:34:51;01:34:54;"they'll take it, they'll put your coffee in that"
01:34:54;01:34:57;"It doesn't have to be a Starbucks branded tumbler?"
01:34:57;01:34:58;"I don't know"
01:34:58;01:34:59;"Mine is"
01:34:59;01:35:02;"but several people have asked me that question"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"Knowing people"
01:35:04;01:35:07;"you gotta assume that somebody's walking in there"
01:35:07;01:35:08;"with a Dunkin Donuts tumbler"
01:35:08;01:35:10;"and trying to get the discount"
01:35:10;01:35:12;"Yeah, some Massachusetts wise guy"
01:35:12;01:35:15;"Yeah, absolutely"
01:35:15;01:35:16;"But it's a great deal for me"
01:35:16;01:35:21;"It's saving me a third of what I'm spending on coffee"
01:35:21;01:35:25;"So yeah, those would probably be the top 5 Starbucks stories"
01:35:25;01:35:26;"The challenge for you would be"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"if you were trying to compare"
01:35:28;01:35:32;"with the top 5 Starbucks stories of say 1997"
01:35:32;01:35:33;"That would be interesting"
01:35:33;01:35:34;"but it would be fun to hear Jake say"
01:35:34;01:35:39;"""Ah, 1997 was a rough year for Starbucks news"""
01:35:39;01:35:44;"1997 was a rough year for Starbucks news"
01:35:44;01:35:47;"I'm not feeling the 97 bucks news, man"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"Winter, can you tell us what happened in '97"
01:35:49;01:35:51;"just off the top of your dome?"
01:35:51;01:35:52;"Major news? No"
01:35:52;01:35:55;"But I mean, I know that Singapore came online"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"Thailand came online"
01:35:57;01:36:02;"Yeah, Japan was '97, but it might have been '96"
01:36:02;01:36:04;"A lot of countries came online"
01:36:04;01:36:05;"So that would have been news"
01:36:05;01:36:09;"They crossed the 1500 store threshold"
01:36:09;01:36:10;"So that would have been another piece of news"
01:36:10;01:36:12;"Okay, you know your history"
01:36:12;01:36:15;"And didn't you come online in '97?"
01:36:15;01:36:19;"That's probably the biggest Starbucks news of 1997"
01:36:19;01:36:23;"Winter conceived of Starbucking"
01:36:23;01:36:26;"You have actually called me on a significant day"
01:36:26;01:36:28;"This is not airing on the 12th"
01:36:28;01:36:29;"but we're recording on June the 12th"
01:36:29;01:36:31;"Banking the Ips"
01:36:31;01:36:31;"Yep, yep"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"25 years ago today"
01:36:33;01:36:36;"I visited my first set of Starbucks"
01:36:36;01:36:39;"outside of Texas"
01:36:39;01:36:43;"I was on a business trip to La Crosse, Wisconsin"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"which is near to where I happen to be now"
01:36:45;01:36:49;"And the flight connected through MSP, of course"
01:36:49;01:36:52;"And once I saw that on my ticket"
01:36:52;01:36:53;"gears started turning"
01:36:53;01:36:58;"got to the airport while waiting for the flight to board"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"I asked if I could change the return"
01:37:00;01:37:03;"And for about $150"
01:37:03;01:37:07;"I changed it so that I got several days in Minneapolis"
01:37:07;01:37:08;"to hang out with a friend"
01:37:08;01:37:14;"And we hit about five or six of the early Minnesota Starbucks"
01:37:14;01:37:19;"That is one of the most well-defined events"
01:37:19;01:37:20;"in the history of Starbucking"
01:37:20;01:37:23;"The early history is fuzzy"
01:37:23;01:37:26;"because I didn't realize it would get to this point"
01:37:26;01:37:27;"So I wasn't blogging"
01:37:27;01:37:29;"There was no Instagram, no Facebook"
01:37:29;01:37:30;"I didn't post on Facebook"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"""Hey, I'm gonna visit every Starbucks in the world"""
01:37:32;01:37:35;"So I'll never know the exact day"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"that I came up with the idea"
01:37:37;01:37:40;"I do know that it couldn't have been any earlier than May 18th"
01:37:40;01:37:43;"because that's the first time that I went to the Starbucks"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"where I had the idea"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"And I know that by June the 10th"
01:37:47;01:37:48;"I had had the idea"
01:37:48;01:37:51;"because that's when I made the flight change"
01:37:51;01:37:54;"So there's about a three-week window there"
01:37:54;01:37:57;"where I came up with the idea"
01:37:57;01:38:00;"But, you know, I'd call June 12th"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"not the beginning of Starbucking"
01:38:02;01:38:04;"but a significant date in its history"
01:38:04;01:38:06;"Well, so one thing's for sure"
01:38:06;01:38:09;"is that this year is the 25th anniversary of Starbucking"
01:38:09;01:38:10;"Yes, yes"
01:38:10;01:38:12;"Within this three-week window and..."
01:38:12;01:38:14;"You should make a t-shirt or something"
01:38:14;01:38:16;"That would be a good idea"
01:38:16;01:38:18;"I... or a card that I would hand out"
01:38:18;01:38:20;"to anybody that comes out and meets me on the road"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"I just hung out with some Starbucking fans"
01:38:22;01:38:24;"down in Appleton, Wisconsin"
01:38:24;01:38:26;"And, you know, I've got some people that want to meet me on this trip"
01:38:26;01:38:28;"I handed them a little card"
01:38:28;01:38:32;"But a 25th anniversary card would have been a nice idea"
01:38:32;01:38:34;"Too bad it didn't happen earlier"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"I could have done that"
01:38:36;01:38:39;"The other significant news is, of course, I turned 50"
01:38:39;01:38:41;"So it's a great coincidence"
01:38:41;01:38:45;"that now I have been Starbucking for exactly half of my life"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"Wow, that's amazing"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"How are you all doing?"
01:38:49;01:38:52;"I imagine that you are busy recording LP5"
01:38:52;01:38:55;"and Jake, you know, besides all his activities"
01:38:55;01:38:56;"has got the young daughter"
01:38:56;01:38:57;"Great, yeah"
01:38:57;01:38:59;"You hit the nail on the head, Winter"
01:38:59;01:39:02;"When I'm not recording Time Crisis"
01:39:02;01:39:04;"spending a lot of time working on LP5"
01:39:04;01:39:06;"It's going great so far"
01:39:06;01:39:07;"Hopefully finish it soon"
01:39:07;01:39:08;"And also we've been playing a lot of shows"
01:39:08;01:39:12;"I just got back from Indianapolis today"
01:39:12;01:39:13;"That was a great show"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"It would have been nice to see you all there"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"but I'm not big on the festival environment"
01:39:17;01:39:20;"I've actually been going to a lot of shows myself"
01:39:20;01:39:22;"I have churches tomorrow"
01:39:22;01:39:24;"I saw Nico Case last week"
01:39:24;01:39:27;"But I can't wait for you all to finish your album"
01:39:27;01:39:28;"and go on tour"
01:39:28;01:39:31;"so that I can do what I was going to do in 2019"
01:39:31;01:39:33;"I had four back-to-back shows"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"I was going to follow you all the way from like"
01:39:35;01:39:37;"Oh, in 2020?"
01:39:37;01:39:40;"In 2019, before the pandemic"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"Oh, yeah, 2020, before the pandemic"
01:39:42;01:39:43;"You probably bought the tickets in 2019"
01:39:43;01:39:45;"Yeah, I bought the tickets"
01:39:45;01:39:48;"And then you had a show in Maine"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"I think another one maybe in New Hampshire"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"You had one maybe around Buffalo"
01:39:52;01:39:53;"And then down to Pittsburgh"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"I had all four of those planned"
01:39:55;01:39:59;"I haven't followed a band since Lillith Fair"
01:39:59;01:40:01;"back in the late 90s"
01:40:01;01:40:04;"I was looking forward to the idea of following a band"
01:40:04;01:40:05;"That wasn't following a band"
01:40:05;01:40:06;"It was following a tour"
01:40:06;01:40:07;"I understand what you mean"
01:40:07;01:40:08;"Festivals..."
01:40:08;01:40:09;"We only have festivals this year"
01:40:09;01:40:10;"and you're right"
01:40:10;01:40:12;"The festival atmosphere is great"
01:40:12;01:40:14;"but it is fundamentally different"
01:40:14;01:40:16;"Also, the sets aren't going to be as long"
01:40:16;01:40:19;"You might not get quite as much song variation"
01:40:19;01:40:22;"But I imagine, hopefully by next year"
01:40:22;01:40:24;"there'll be some real headline touring at some point"
01:40:24;01:40:28;"And next time, Winter, you don't have to buy tickets"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"I got you, whatever you need"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"Alright, alright, I'll keep that in mind"
01:40:32;01:40:35;"Although, I don't know if that breaks the rules of vampire weekending"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"[laughs]"
01:40:37;01:40:41;"No, it most definitely does not break the rules of vampire weekending"
01:40:41;01:40:44;"As long as you purchase one black coffee per show"
01:40:44;01:40:46;"from me directly"
01:42:27;01:42:29;"Winter, speaking of music"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"We know that you like a lot of new music"
01:42:31;01:42:33;"What are your feelings about Elvis?"
01:42:33;01:42:34;"The film?"
01:42:34;01:42:35;"No, not the film"
01:42:35;01:42:36;"The artist"
01:42:37;01:42:40;"I've never been a huge fan of that style of music"
01:42:40;01:42:43;"But, you know, it's like if it comes on the jukebox"
01:42:43;01:42:44;"I'm not going to turn it off"
01:42:44;01:42:45;"I'm not going to leave"
01:42:45;01:42:47;"I'm fine with it, I'm just not a huge fan"
01:42:47;01:42:51;"Are you a huge fan of any music from like the 50s or 60s?"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"Wow"
01:42:53;01:42:54;"50s, 60s"
01:42:54;01:42:55;"Beatles?"
01:42:55;01:42:57;"I wouldn't, oh, definitely the Beatles"
01:42:57;01:42:58;"Oh yeah, absolutely"
01:42:58;01:43:01;"More recent, 70s, 80s"
01:43:01;01:43:06;"The things that were playing when I started listening to music"
01:43:06;01:43:07;"which was in the 80s"
01:43:07;01:43:09;"But, certainly the Beatles"
01:43:09;01:43:10;"Right"
01:43:10;01:43:11;"You know what?"
01:43:11;01:43:13;"In every genre of music"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"there's going to be something that I like"
01:43:15;01:43:17;"So, you know, that's"
01:43:17;01:43:18;"Open-minded"
01:43:18;01:43:20;"I'm not like somebody who says"
01:43:20;01:43:22;"No country music for me"
01:43:22;01:43:23;"or no hip-hop for me"
01:43:23;01:43:24;"Right"
01:43:24;01:43:29;"I can't think of any genre that I wouldn't listen to"
01:43:29;01:43:31;"But we're burying the lead here"
01:43:31;01:43:35;"Of course, the biggest star-bucking story, I would say"
01:43:35;01:43:39;"is the fact that I actually finished the manuscript of my book"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"The first draft"
01:43:41;01:43:43;"90,000 words"
01:43:43;01:43:45;"which, in my opinion, is way too long"
01:43:45;01:43:48;"and that doesn't even include the bonus chapter"
01:43:48;01:43:50;"that's going to be pure philosophy"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"The 90,000 that I've got so far"
01:43:52;01:43:55;"is straight star-bucking narrative"
01:43:55;01:43:59;"How many pages would 90,000 words be in a typical book?"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"I honestly have no idea"
01:44:01;01:44:02;"and I've been wondering that"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"Is that like War and Peace level?"
01:44:04;01:44:07;"How many words are in War and Peace?"
01:44:07;01:44:11;"I googled like 30 to 50,000 words"
01:44:11;01:44:13;"as like an average book"
01:44:13;01:44:15;"That's what I googled"
01:44:15;01:44:17;"when I started writing process"
01:44:17;01:44:19;"But I have no idea about the formatting"
01:44:19;01:44:20;"It could be 100 pages"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"It could be 200 pages"
01:44:22;01:44:25;"There's so much I don't know about publishing"
01:44:25;01:44:26;"Okay, well, I know that"
01:44:26;01:44:27;"But, Winter, just so you know"
01:44:27;01:44:30;"War and Peace, the famously long Russian novel"
01:44:30;01:44:33;"is 587,287 words"
01:44:33;01:44:34;"Thanks, Seinfeld"
01:44:34;01:44:36;"So 90,000 actually sounds pretty reasonable"
01:44:36;01:44:39;"I'm glad that it's shorter than War and Peace"
01:44:39;01:44:44;"Significantly shorter"
01:44:44;01:44:46;"But also, I guess this is interesting"
01:44:46;01:44:48;"because I'm a big believer"
01:44:48;01:44:50;"in a lot of categories"
01:44:50;01:44:52;"that you just don't want to get caught in the middle"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"And I could see"
01:44:54;01:44:58;"with your first official book"
01:44:58;01:45:01;"I could see the kind of slim volume"
01:45:01;01:45:03;"like 120 pages"
01:45:03;01:45:06;"Quick intro to starbucking"
01:45:06;01:45:07;"Just the basics"
01:45:07;01:45:09;"Kind of easy read"
01:45:09;01:45:12;"But I also like the idea of this massive tome"
01:45:12;01:45:16;"that is like a world in and of itself"
01:45:16;01:45:19;"I think there's something very appealing about that"
01:45:19;01:45:21;"And I get especially excited when you mention"
01:45:21;01:45:24;"there being a whole final section about philosophy"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"Yes, yes"
01:45:26;01:45:28;"And it's funny you mention War and Peace"
01:45:28;01:45:32;"because Tolstoy spread philosophy"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"throughout the chapters of the book"
01:45:34;01:45:37;"But then there comes a point late in the book"
01:45:37;01:45:39;"where he entirely stops the narrative"
01:45:39;01:45:43;"And the writing is just pure philosophy"
01:45:43;01:45:45;"Like the story of the family and the war"
01:45:45;01:45:46;"and everything that's going on"
01:45:46;01:45:47;"I barely remember the details"
01:45:47;01:45:49;"because it was 25 years ago"
01:45:49;01:45:50;"But that story stops"
01:45:50;01:45:52;"and it's just pure philosophy"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"So I'm borrowing that"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"You're reading War and Peace"
01:45:56;01:45:58;"right when you started starbucking?"
01:45:58;01:46:00;"No, 25 years ago"
01:46:00;01:46:02;"25 years ago I read War and Peace"
01:46:02;01:46:04;"And I couldn't tell you a single thing"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"That's when you started starbucking 25 years ago"
01:46:06;01:46:08;"Well, yeah, roughly 25 years ago"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"Sometime between '95 and '97"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"I'd go to Barnes & Noble"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"and read a chapter every night"
01:46:14;01:46:15;"or something like that"
01:46:15;01:46:18;"But I couldn't tell you anything that happened in the book"
01:46:18;01:46:20;"The most significant thing I remember"
01:46:20;01:46:22;"is that Tolstoy did not feel constrained"
01:46:22;01:46:25;"by the need to have the entire book be narrative"
01:46:25;01:46:27;"And he was quite liberal about"
01:46:27;01:46:29;"bringing the philosophy throughout the book"
01:46:29;01:46:30;"which is what I've done"
01:46:30;01:46:31;"Ooh, I love that"
01:46:31;01:46:32;"But that's a challenge"
01:46:32;01:46:34;"trying to find the balance between narrative"
01:46:34;01:46:36;"which is what keeps people interested"
01:46:36;01:46:38;"and a little bit of my own personal thinking"
01:46:38;01:46:40;"Do you have an editor?"
01:46:40;01:46:44;"That is what I've desperately been looking for all year"
01:46:44;01:46:46;"Actually, I'm looking for an agent"
01:46:46;01:46:48;"That's where I've started"
01:46:48;01:46:50;"I'm hoping that the agent will find me"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"both a publisher"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"who will then assign me an editor"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"and then start shopping around screenwrites"
01:46:56;01:46:59;"because I think this would be a great story"
01:46:59;01:47:02;"for a 6-10 part streaming series"
01:47:02;01:47:05;"on Netflix, Amazon, or whatever"
01:47:05;01:47:07;"That's my top goal"
01:47:07;01:47:10;"I've also been contacting small publishers"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"I went back and forth with one"
01:47:12;01:47:14;"but ultimately what I was writing"
01:47:14;01:47:17;"was just not part of their mission"
01:47:17;01:47:22;"And I've been learning that it is a difficult process"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"but I expected from the beginning"
01:47:24;01:47:27;"that this could take 1-2 years"
01:47:27;01:47:31;"to stumble across the right agent"
01:47:31;01:47:32;"who's interested"
01:47:32;01:47:35;"and then have that person be the right agent"
01:47:35;01:47:36;"I'm sure between the four of us"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"we must know somebody"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"Maybe there's somebody listening right now"
01:47:40;01:47:41;"but definitely when you start getting into that"
01:47:41;01:47:42;"making that miniseries"
01:47:42;01:47:43;"I really hope you'll sit down"
01:47:43;01:47:45;"and take a meeting with TC Productions"
01:47:45;01:47:50;"We've had many ideas for films and programs"
01:47:50;01:47:51;"on Time Crisis"
01:47:51;01:47:53;"but we never actually pulled the trigger"
01:47:53;01:47:55;"but this could be the one"
01:47:55;01:47:56;"I was just thinking this sounds like the first"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"This could be the first one"
01:47:58;01:47:59;"production, yeah"
01:47:59;01:48:01;"You know, of course you have to accept our offer"
01:48:01;01:48:03;"And you can't rule out Apple"
01:48:03;01:48:06;"I mean, Apple's certainly looking hungry for content"
01:48:06;01:48:08;"I love their platform"
01:48:08;01:48:11;"So, but one step at a time"
01:48:11;01:48:12;"Apple's making some good shows"
01:48:12;01:48:13;"You watch Severance?"
01:48:13;01:48:16;"I did, I've pretty much watched everything"
01:48:16;01:48:18;"that Apple has put out"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"all the dramas and some of the comedies"
01:48:20;01:48:23;"and I was an early evangelist for Apple TV+"
01:48:23;01:48:25;"I kept posting it in my TV group"
01:48:25;01:48:28;"saying, ""Guys, don't sleep on Apple TV+"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"People are, like, mocking it"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"but they're putting out really good shows"
01:48:32;01:48:35;"and sure enough, they eventually start winning awards"
01:48:35;01:48:37;"and got a lot of buzzworthy shows"
01:48:37;01:48:40;"Hopefully, Starbucking will be one of them in five years"
01:48:40;01:48:44;"If you had to pick an actor to be in the running"
01:48:44;01:48:47;"to play you in the Apple+ miniseries"
01:48:47;01:48:49;"anybody come to mind?"
01:48:49;01:48:52;"I think he would need to be an unknown, to be honest"
01:48:52;01:48:55;"but since we're throwing out names"
01:48:55;01:48:57;"what about Justice Smith?"
01:48:57;01:49:00;"He was in, I think, The Get Down"
01:49:00;01:49:03;"and then he was just in a film"
01:49:03;01:49:06;"Jurassic Park, Jurassic World"
01:49:06;01:49:07;"Is that Will Smith's son?"
01:49:07;01:49:10;"No, I think that's, isn't that Jaden Smith?"
01:49:10;01:49:11;"Yeah, but there's an older brother"
01:49:11;01:49:13;"There is an older brother"
01:49:13;01:49:14;"I don't know"
01:49:14;01:49:16;"No, Justin Smith's father is Wayne Smith"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"Oh yeah, I can kind of see the resemblance"
01:49:18;01:49:23;"Yeah, and it doesn't have to be a strict resemblance"
01:49:23;01:49:26;"more like just somebody who can capture the spirit"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"of what Starbucking is about"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"and I saw The Get Down"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"and I've seen him in a few other things"
01:49:32;01:49:33;"He's a good actor"
01:49:33;01:49:35;"So, the first name that comes to mind"
01:49:35;01:49:39;"But Winter, as a Hollywood insider"
01:49:39;01:49:42;"I can tell you that celebrity definitely moves the needle"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"There's not a lot of unknowns that you see in these shows"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"Unfortunately, that is true"
01:49:46;01:49:48;"Let's say you have to pick someone"
01:49:48;01:49:52;"just absolutely incredibly famous to play you"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"You need a marquee celebrity"
01:49:54;01:49:57;"Well, when that Vice video came out three years ago"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"like half the people who commented"
01:49:59;01:50:02;"said that I look like Vin Diesel"
01:50:02;01:50:04;"Okay, now we're talking"
01:50:04;01:50:05;"You know what?"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"That's actually really interesting"
01:50:07;01:50:10;"because one thing that people always say about Vin Diesel"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"this is not apples to apples"
01:50:12;01:50:14;"but many people know him as just like"
01:50:14;01:50:18;"the big buff action star of Fast and the Furious"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"but then there's this other side to him"
01:50:20;01:50:23;"that he releases music"
01:50:23;01:50:26;"he's a big Dungeons and Dragons fan"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"All that is to say is that you always get this impression"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"that there's this totally other side to him"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"and he is a good actor"
01:50:32;01:50:36;"and in a way, it's great for him"
01:50:36;01:50:37;"and great for fans of the franchise"
01:50:37;01:50:39;"but it's a bit of a shame that"
01:50:39;01:50:41;"all of his energy goes into Fast and the Furious"
01:50:41;01:50:45;"because he needs his uncut gems"
01:50:45;01:50:47;"You know what I mean?"
01:50:47;01:50:50;"Just imagine the Variety headline"
01:50:50;01:50:54;"Vin Diesel signs on for a Starbucking miniseries"
01:50:54;01:50:56;"What is Starbucking?"
01:50:56;01:50:59;"It's a story of Winter who invented it in 1997"
01:50:59;01:51:01;"going to every Starbucks in the world"
01:51:01;01:51:04;"When I hear about Vin Diesel being in a movie"
01:51:04;01:51:07;"about a guy trying to go to every Starbucks in the world"
01:51:07;01:51:08;"and document them"
01:51:08;01:51:12;"I'm like, this is exactly the left turn we needed"
01:51:12;01:51:13;"from you"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"He's too old though"
01:51:15;01:51:17;"to get me in my prime"
01:51:17;01:51:18;"Irishman"
01:51:18;01:51:21;"Or, it could be structured as"
01:51:21;01:51:24;"Vin Diesel is playing me older"
01:51:24;01:51:26;"he's already done Starbucking"
01:51:26;01:51:29;"now he's mentoring the next generation of Starbuckers"
01:51:29;01:51:33;"Oh yeah, like the new Top Gun"
01:51:33;01:51:35;"Starbucking Maverick"
01:51:36;01:51:39;"Yeah, the truth is"
01:51:39;01:51:42;"we should have made the first Starbucking movie 25 years ago"
01:51:42;01:51:45;"and then we'd be coming back with Vin Diesel"
01:51:45;01:51:48;"and he's old and he's mentoring"
01:51:48;01:51:50;"Zendaya and Timothee Chalamet"
01:51:50;01:51:51;"or something like that"
01:51:51;01:51:55;"Just like Tom Cruise's Maverick pushed it too far"
01:51:55;01:51:58;"at the beginning of the sequel"
01:51:58;01:52:00;"sorry if I spoiled anything for everybody"
01:52:00;01:52:01;"I could do the same thing"
01:52:01;01:52:03;"Vin Diesel could be playing me"
01:52:03;01:52:05;"he Starbucks way too hard"
01:52:05;01:52:10;"and finally gets a lifetime ban from all the Starbucks on the planet"
01:52:10;01:52:13;"but now he's got to mentor the next generation"
01:52:13;01:52:15;"he's got to find a protege"
01:52:15;01:52:17;"That's amazing"
01:52:17;01:52:21;"Who do you see playing your nemesis Howard Schultz?"
01:52:21;01:52:23;"Oh man"
01:52:23;01:52:25;"That's a juicy role"
01:52:25;01:52:28;"I don't think Trump does acting anymore"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"Wow, okay"
01:52:30;01:52:34;"But, I don't know, Alec Baldwin?"
01:52:34;01:52:35;"That's fun"
01:52:35;01:52:36;"Comeback story for him"
01:52:36;01:52:38;"He's got the comedic chop"
01:52:38;01:52:40;"But first things first, the book"
01:52:40;01:52:42;"If there's any agents"
01:52:42;01:52:44;"anybody who wants to get in touch with the winter"
01:52:44;01:52:46;"you can do it via Seinfeld"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"8minutecapecod@gmail.com"
01:52:48;01:52:50;"we'd be happy to put you guys in touch"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"and we'll put our heads together"
01:52:52;01:52:54;"and do a bit of thinking over here winter"
01:52:54;01:52:56;"because I would love to see"
01:52:56;01:52:58;"you could self-release that book"
01:52:58;01:53:00;"and I think there would definitely be a lot of interest"
01:53:00;01:53:02;"but it would be cool to see the kind of"
01:53:02;01:53:06;"glossy big publisher version too"
01:53:06;01:53:09;"Absolutely, like I've told a number of people already"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"based on my social media profile"
01:53:11;01:53:14;"I could self-publish and sell a thousand books"
01:53:14;01:53:15;"copies"
01:53:15;01:53:17;"And you always see these stories in the news"
01:53:17;01:53:21;"where some big celebrity gets paid some insane advance"
01:53:21;01:53:23;"there was just like some article about this recently"
01:53:23;01:53:25;"these giant celebrities getting these big advances"
01:53:25;01:53:29;"and then it's like how many copies did that memoir sell"
01:53:29;01:53:31;"and it's like 600 copies"
01:53:31;01:53:35;"and it's really about how interested people are in the story"
01:53:35;01:53:36;"and the person"
01:53:36;01:53:38;"it doesn't matter how big their profile is"
01:53:38;01:53:41;"there's people with huge profiles where nobody actually wants to buy their book"
01:53:41;01:53:44;"whereas I would imagine the vast majority of people who"
01:53:44;01:53:46;"know who you are winter"
01:53:46;01:53:48;"and follow you and care about what you do"
01:53:48;01:53:50;"the number of those people who would buy your book"
01:53:50;01:53:53;"is very high, we're talking like 90%"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"where sometimes you get big political figures"
01:53:55;01:53:58;"where the number of people who actually want to read their book is 4%"
01:53:58;01:53:59;"you know what I mean?"
01:53:59;01:54:01;"Yeah, no, I agree with you completely"
01:54:01;01:54:03;"and that's exactly what's in my book proposal"
01:54:03;01:54:05;"the marketability"
01:54:05;01:54:07;"so my angle is"
01:54:07;01:54:09;"I'm not a great writer"
01:54:09;01:54:12;"this is not supposed to be the next great memoir"
01:54:12;01:54:15;"it's not Obama quality writing"
01:54:15;01:54:18;"but it's got a hook that interests people"
01:54:18;01:54:21;"and I just need to find that one agent"
01:54:21;01:54:23;"Ok, just don't sell yourself short"
01:54:23;01:54:26;"you never want to come in with ""I'm not a great writer"""
01:54:26;01:54:28;"I appreciate your modesty"
01:54:28;01:54:33;"because also, you know, with the right editor"
01:54:33;01:54:35;"you're a smart guy and you are a writer"
01:54:35;01:54:38;"so with the right editor they're gonna make it sing"
01:54:38;01:54:40;"there you go, there you go, that's what I'm hoping"
01:54:40;01:54:43;"you might say ""I'm not the most experienced writer"""
01:54:43;01:54:47;"""I don't have an MFA from the Iowa Writers Workshop"""
01:54:47;01:54:49;"""but I got heart and I got grit"""
01:54:49;01:54:51;"and he has a story"
01:54:51;01:54:53;"that's how I'd put it"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"I like the way you think"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"but you know what?"
01:54:57;01:54:59;"regardless of what happens"
01:54:59;01:55:01;"this whole process has been fascinating"
01:55:01;01:55:03;"just because I like learning new things"
01:55:03;01:55:06;"so I'm learning all these things about how you go about"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"trying to get a book published"
01:55:08;01:55:11;"things like what is a query letter, what is a book proposal"
01:55:11;01:55:14;"how do you submit on all these different websites"
01:55:14;01:55:16;"the difference between literary agents"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"TV literary agents"
01:55:18;01:55:21;"publishers that will not accept a proposal"
01:55:21;01:55:23;"if it doesn't come with an agent"
01:55:23;01:55:25;"others that do"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"I'm just discovering this whole new world"
01:55:27;01:55:30;"and I actually kind of enjoy the process"
01:55:30;01:55:32;"as tedious as it is"
01:55:32;01:55:34;"well, and the truth is"
01:55:34;01:55:36;"if there's anybody on earth"
01:55:36;01:55:38;"who understands this basic lesson"
01:55:38;01:55:40;"that we all know and yet we forget"
01:55:40;01:55:42;"which is that in life it's about the journey"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"not the destination"
01:55:44;01:55:46;"if there's anybody on earth who should know that"
01:55:46;01:55:48;"the journey is about the journey"
01:55:48;01:55:50;"and not the destination"
01:55:50;01:55:52;"so I think that's the beauty of it"
01:55:52;01:55:54;"and I think that's the beauty of it"
