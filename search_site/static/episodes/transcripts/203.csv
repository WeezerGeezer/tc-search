00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:05;00:10;"On this week's episode, we go through all the hottest news."
00:10;00:16;"Seinfeld news, music news, and Tim Hortons news."
00:16;00:24;"Prepare to get your brain filled with all the info that you need to know to navigate the world today."
00:24;00:30;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:16;01:21;"Time Crisis, back again. What's up, fellas?"
01:21;01:23;"Hey, what's up?"
01:23;01:27;"Here we are."
01:27;01:29;"What up?"
01:29;01:30;"What up?"
01:30;01:31;"Here we are."
01:31;01:32;"What's going on?"
01:32;01:33;"Back once again."
01:33;01:35;"I feel like we need like a lead in."
01:35;01:43;"I could definitely start writing kind of like NPR style, kind of like summaries of the show."
01:43;01:53;"Isn't that like a thing where it's like after we record the whole thing, then it kind of opens with like, wow, almost Halloween again."
01:53;01:57;"This time of year always gets me thinking about blah, blah, blah."
01:57;02:05;"There was a time when I like tell a little story and then go, anyway, on today's episode, me, Jake, Seinfeld, and Nick."
02:05;02:06;"You know, like that kind of thing?"
02:06;02:07;"Yeah."
02:07;02:09;"That really get the people pumped up."
02:09;02:16;"Or like a classic. I noticed this. I'd like, like there's a few podcasts on the ringer I listen to and they do really good intros."
02:16;02:22;"This dude, Chris Ryan, will always be like, I'm Chris Ryan, an editor at the ringer and joining me on the mic."
02:22;02:27;"He doesn't give one F about an Oxford comma. It's Ezra Koenig."
02:27;02:28;"Right."
02:28;02:33;"And then it's like high energy. It's like, you know, it's like a nice like kind of takeoff ramp."
02:33;02:34;"Right."
02:34;02:40;"So we shout everybody out, get the people pumped and then be like, no beating around the bush."
02:40;02:43;"We have to we need like an opening segment."
02:43;02:44;"Yeah."
02:44;02:47;"Because we're always coming in solo energy."
02:47;02:48;"Right."
02:48;02:50;"And I bet we open with the top five."
02:50;02:57;"Be like, we've learned that internet radio listeners and podcast listeners, they want you coming out strong."
02:57;03:00;"You hook them in the first 15. It doesn't matter if it peters out towards the end."
03:00;03:06;"We open with the top five, top five songs, five minutes each jukebox jury."
03:06;03:08;"New Gunna song. Jake, what do you think?"
03:08;03:10;"Hate it. I hate it."
03:10;03:12;"Last time I hate it again. Seinfeld."
03:12;03:17;"What about you? I'm going to disagree."
03:17;03:19;"Open with the top five."
03:19;03:20;"Yeah, I feel like this show. Yeah."
03:20;03:22;"Like it's all is better in the second hour."
03:22;03:24;"It's like a dead show."
03:24;03:26;"That's right."
03:26;03:32;"You think there's anybody is there anybody that just straight up just cuts right to the middle, just scrubs the first half?"
03:32;03:33;"I could see it."
03:33;03:35;"Well, we also got a hard on ourselves."
03:35;03:37;"We do have our great editor, Matt."
03:37;03:40;"So he's I think he's making it sing across the board."
03:40;03:41;"That's true. Right."
03:41;03:42;"I do feel you, Jake."
03:42;03:43;"Shout out to Matt."
03:43;03:46;"And I'm actually surprised that this has never come up before."
03:46;03:47;"But I think you're right there."
03:47;03:51;"It no matter what, it's like a dead show in that the first and second half are different."
03:51;04:00;"Yeah. First half, you might get a very earnest Merle Haggard cover with not a particular lot of soloing."
04:00;04:03;"And I turned 21 in prison."
04:03;04:06;"That was Bob where my version of Bob were saying Merle Haggard."
04:06;04:08;"And I turned 21 in prison."
04:08;04:10;"Doing life without parole."
04:10;04:14;"So you're going to get some kind of like random fun stuff like that."
04:14;04:17;"And then the second half is maybe the sun goes down."
04:17;04:20;"And yeah, it maybe it gets a bit deeper."
04:20;04:22;"The jams get a little tastier."
04:22;04:24;"The medallio starts hitting."
04:24;04:27;"Yeah, I was going to say that second or third medallio hits."
04:27;04:32;"I would just caution Matt not to make it sing so great that we lose another popcorn and raisins."
04:32;04:33;"True."
04:33;04:34;"That's all I would say."
04:34;04:35;"From the vault."
04:35;04:37;"I think that's unfair."
04:37;04:38;"Matt, how could he have known?"
04:38;04:40;"Not trying to put you on the spot."
04:40;04:44;"Some of our greatest hits end up on the cutting room floor."
04:44;04:49;"We need some time to warm up, but we don't subject the audience to all of that."
04:49;04:51;"Since none of us have ever listened to the show,"
04:51;04:55;"what if we found out that Matt has been taking basically all the second half"
04:55;04:58;"and just cutting up and putting it up front?"
04:58;05:03;"Every show contains side two of Tattoo You."
05:03;05:05;"That's a pretty good idea."
05:05;05:10;"Well, Seinfeld listens to the show because he'll live tweet it sometimes."
05:10;05:11;"Yeah."
05:11;05:12;"And I'll check in."
05:12;05:13;"I'll check in on the show."
05:13;05:14;"I've heard some."
05:15;05:16;"Not in a while."
05:16;05:18;"That'd be funny if just like..."
05:18;05:22;"I've been hearing a lot of stories from various people meeting a TC head in the wild,"
05:22;05:24;"including Rashida met a TC head in the wild."
05:24;05:25;"Oh, that was a crazy story."
05:25;05:28;"He said he's a big fan of her and Jake's banter."
05:28;05:30;"Right, the Gen X showdown."
05:30;05:32;"But so, you know, we know they're out there,"
05:32;05:35;"but I'm just picturing a scenario where one of us meets a TC head"
05:35;05:37;"and they're just like, ""Loving the show."
05:37;05:39;"And I love the pivot just to more tunes, man."
05:39;05:41;"Less talking."
05:41;05:43;"Just like a '90s radio station."
05:43;05:45;"More of what you want, the tunes and less talking."""
05:45;05:47;"And you're like, ""Wait, what do you mean?"""
05:47;05:50;"No, I just love that, like, you know, enough of the junk."
05:50;05:53;"Just the greatest hits of the '70s, '80s, and '90s."
05:53;05:57;"Like, ""I love that you guys are doing 52 minutes an hour of music."""
05:57;06:00;"We're like, ""No, I mean we talk a lot."""
06:00;06:03;"He's like, ""You know, maybe you guys talk a lot when you're recording,"
06:03;06:07;"but, you know, it really sings when it hits the air."""
06:07;06:12;"The new TC promise, 52 minutes of music an hour, and that's guaranteed."
06:12;06:14;"That's a TC guarantee."
06:14;06:17;"All right, just throw in ""Side to a Tattoo You."""
06:21;06:26;"You do the little things, the things to me"
06:26;06:31;"Sometime I'm worried, girl"
06:31;06:38;"That you ain't never lovin' me"
06:38;06:43;"Sometime I stay up late"
06:43;06:48;"Yeah, I haven't fall"
06:48;06:55;"Yeah, I'm busy, you know by now"
06:55;07:00;"That you ain't that lonely boy"
07:00;07:06;"Yeah, I'm better off"
07:06;07:12;"Ooh, the sweet things that you promised me"
07:15;07:19;"You're the sweetest girl I've ever known"
07:19;07:24;"Yeah, vanished like a dream"
07:24;07:30;"Baby, I wonder why"
07:30;07:36;"Yeah, you do these things to me"
07:39;07:46;"'Cause I'm worried, yeah, I just can't seem to find my way"
07:46;07:51;"Baby"
07:51;07:55;"Oh, speaking of ""Side to a Tattoo You,"" is that Stone's record out yet?"
07:55;08:00;"'Cause we could just—I would love to just kind of check out that record with you guys, first listen."
08:00;08:02;"Not a bad idea."
08:02;08:05;"I know the single's out. We could listen to the single."
08:05;08:07;"Did you hear the single?"
08:07;08:09;"Yeah. ""Angry."""
08:09;08:10;"What'd you think of it?"
08:10;08:11;"Pretty good."
08:11;08:12;"Okay."
08:12;08:20;"Kind of surprised. Video also is sick, and I rarely watch music videos, but somehow it crossed my transom."
08:20;08:27;"Okay, ""Weird Flex."" Album came out—28th. Came out two weeks ago."
08:27;08:30;"The full record? The full album? No, no."
08:30;08:35;"Oh, no, no. I'm way off. It comes out October 20th."
08:35;08:39;"Okay, so next show we could do a full listen of the record."
08:39;08:43;"I won't be angry with you"
08:43;08:47;"But I can't see straight"
08:47;08:49;"I wonder if that's Charlie on drums."
08:49;08:53;"I don't think so. Doesn't sound like it."
08:53;09:00;"We have our fate in love, and I wanna know why"
09:00;09:03;"Why you angry with me"
09:03;09:05;"Why you angry with me"
09:05;09:07;"So far it sounds like the Stones."
09:07;09:09;"Please just forget about me"
09:09;09:10;"Can't stop my name"
09:10;09:12;"I'll tell you the exact moment it stops sounding like the Stones."
09:12;09:15;"I love you just the same"
09:15;09:17;"I hear a voice"
09:17;09:19;"Yep. Yep."
09:19;09:21;"What happened there?"
09:21;09:23;"Don't have to be ashamed"
09:23;09:25;"I think they wanted to throw in a little bit of Bon Jovi energy."
09:25;09:27;"You think they were working with a songwriter?"
09:27;09:34;"Well, this song is produced by Andrew Watt, who's a 30-something producer."
09:34;09:37;"Produced a lot of big hits. Very successful guy."
09:37;09:46;"And one interesting thing about him is that he's become the go-to producer for all the legends."
09:46;09:50;"He's produced an Ozzy Osbourne album, Rolling Stones."
09:50;09:53;"He did something with Morrissey."
09:53;09:54;"Interesting."
09:54;09:57;"You angry with me"
09:57;09:59;"Why you angry with me"
09:59;10:01;"Voices keep echoing"
10:01;10:03;"Calling out my name"
10:03;10:05;"Hear the rain keep falling"
10:05;10:07;"He's a young gun working with the old guys."
10:07;10:12;"He's a young gun who knows pop music, but also is very reverent for the heroes."
10:12;10:17;"So maybe he's the perfect guy to give the people the right amount of classic vibes."
10:17;10:20;"Don't get angry with me"
10:26;10:31;"It's a weird... I mean, I'm listening to it, you know, we're doing the show on FaceTime."
10:31;10:34;"I'm listening to it through my earbuds."
10:34;10:40;"So it's a little tinny, but the drums sound, I don't know, very mechanical, very thin."
10:40;10:45;"They sound a little bit looped, but I bet, you know, there is a reverence for like old school recording."
10:45;10:49;"So I bet that somebody's playing the drums and they might be a bit..."
10:49;10:53;"I mean, obviously you listen to Mick's voice, you can hear a bit of the pitch correction,"
10:53;11:00;"but like, not that he particularly needs it, but that's just, I don't know, this stuff all sounds normal to modern ears."
11:00;11:07;"But if like many of us, you've listened to 60s and 70s Rolling Stones recordings thousands of times,"
11:07;11:11;"of course, you'll always know that something is from the 2020s."
11:11;11:16;"Well, yeah, I mean, I never, I wasn't about to mistake... I heard the song once,"
11:16;11:20;"and I wasn't like mistaking it for like, ""Oh, is this an outtake from Exile?"""
11:20;11:22;"Yeah."
11:22;11:24;"It was very clearly new."
11:24;11:29;"I was just sort of like, ""Yeah, man,"" like kind of recognizing like an old friend."
11:29;11:35;"I was sort of like, ""Oh yeah, man, it sounds exactly like the Stones."""
11:35;11:36;"Yes."
11:36;11:38;"It's hard to put your finger on, like what..."
11:38;11:42;"It's that classic Keith guitar part, you know, he's always in his like, that Keith tuning."
11:42;11:46;"So he always does the same kind of chords, ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding."
11:46;11:52;"Yeah, the only part where it gets in a new territory, for better or for worse, is that like minor chord,"
11:52;11:57;"which is, to me, has kind of like an 80s feeling."
11:57;12:00;"I don't know why, a Bon Jovi comes to mind, it might be better."
12:00;12:03;"Right, or like, did Linda Perry help write this song?"
12:03;12:04;"Yeah."
12:04;12:07;"Please don't forget about that, in that part of the Stones,"
12:07;12:09;"♪ Da-na-na-na ♪"
12:09;12:11;"Yeah, then it's that other chord."
12:11;12:17;"One song that I really liked that Andrew Watt produced, I think last year, was this Morrissey song."
12:17;12:19;"Can you pull up Morrissey's last single?"
12:19;12:25;"Also, just to give you an idea of the way in which this producer/writer, Andrew Watt,"
12:25;12:30;"is not just a producer of modern stuff, but somebody who like, I guess, you know,"
12:30;12:35;"like helps people make music that sounds like themselves."
12:35;12:36;"Because back in the day..."
12:36;12:38;"Is it ""Rebels Without Applause""?"
12:38;12:39;"""Rebels Without Applause."""
12:39;12:40;"That's a great song."
12:41;12:43;"You know what's interesting?"
12:43;12:47;"This sounds truly like he hit the chord."
12:47;12:50;"Like, whatever he did was, he made a Morrissey song."
12:50;12:53;"Like, this is the most throwback-y..."
12:53;12:54;"He made a Smiths song, really."
12:54;12:57;"Yeah, I was like, is this fake Johnny Marr?"
12:57;13:01;"I don't think he pulled off a Johnny Morrissey."

16:31;16:34;"I still throw on the records every now and then."""
16:34;16:39;"It's a cool subgenre of songs--love songs to other bands."
16:39;16:43;"There's the pavement song, ""Unforeseen Power of the Picket Fence,"""
16:43;16:46;"which is a love song to REM."
16:46;16:48;"Oh, I don't know that song."
16:48;16:52;"There's like an old '60s Motown song"
16:52;16:55;"where it's just shouting out other bands that rule."
16:55;16:58;"Wait, is it, um, ""Spotlight on Sam and Dave, yo."""
16:58;16:59;"Yeah, exactly."
16:59;17:02;"My dad had the 45 of that, ""Sweet Soul Music."""
17:02;17:03;"Oh, yeah."
17:03;17:04;"Just throw that on."
17:04;17:05;"That's a great one."
17:05;17:06;"Wait, can I just read this real fast?"
17:06;17:09;"Matt sent over this quote from Morrissey's autobiography."
17:09;17:11;"He's running with Mick Jagger."
17:11;17:12;"Ooh."
17:12;17:16;"""In New York, Mick Jagger arrives backstage and extends the hand of friendship."
17:16;17:20;"It is a big moment for Johnny Marr, but I, of course, is in a nightmare of judgment,"
17:20;17:24;"and it takes me years to understand the secret genius of the Rolling Stones."
17:24;17:27;"Dismissal can be a secret form of arrogance,"
17:27;17:31;"and I held this proudly against the Stones until the light shifted"
17:31;17:33;"and I caught myself being utterly wrong."
17:33;17:38;"The inbuilt censorship can also often be a substitute for not actually knowing any better."
17:38;17:41;"Now I agonize over my criticism of the Stones."
17:41;17:44;"With blather, that was anything but a true reflection of the facts."
17:44;17:48;"In any case, Mick Jagger only stayed for four songs into the Smith set,"
17:48;17:50;"but I felt no hurt at his departure,"
17:50;17:54;"because I could even then understand how my general being,"
17:54;17:58;"which we dare not term a persona, was difficult for a lot of people to take."
17:58;18:02;"As the Smith singer, I consigned all of my best efforts to conviction,"
18:02;18:05;"and all of my being went into each song."""
18:05;18:07;"You know, he's like a cool hipster guy."
18:07;18:10;"It was just like, the Stones suck."
18:10;18:15;"And he mellowed out later and was like, ""Damn, Stones? The secret genius of the Stones."""
18:15;18:18;"Well, it's also, the way he tells that story is interesting,"
18:18;18:23;"because he's implying that Mick left after four songs because his vibe was so bad."
18:23;18:24;"Um..."
18:24;18:26;"What did he say? He left after four songs."
18:26;18:30;"""In any case, Mick Jagger only stayed for four songs into the Smith set,"
18:30;18:32;"but I felt no hurt at his departure,"
18:32;18:36;"because I could even then understand how my general being"
18:36;18:38;"was difficult for a lot of people to take."""
18:38;18:41;"Right. Either he's just being like, ""I just seemed arrogant on stage,"""
18:41;18:43;"and maybe he just didn't want to watch,"
18:43;18:49;"or maybe he's like obliquely implying that he, on stage, he was like..."
18:49;18:51;"Maybe he was saying something weird."
18:51;18:55;"""Oh, Mick Jagger's here. No, but they met backstage."""
18:55;18:57;"Oh, so maybe he met him and he was like a bit of a prick"
18:57;18:59;"and then Mick watched four songs, like, ""I'm getting out of here."""
18:59;19:00;"Yeah."
19:00;19:03;"It's funny. I guess Morrissey's just such a..."
19:03;19:05;"He's such a fanboy."
19:05;19:10;"Even now, even all this time later in his autobiography as like, a much older guy,"
19:10;19:15;"even the way he still thinks about music is still from a fanboy's perspective,"
19:15;19:21;"because it's not like he's saying, ""You know, I used to be just like kind of a prick,"
19:21;19:25;"and like, you know, even some really... Mick Jagger came backstage,"
19:25;19:27;"and I had to be all weird and competitive,"
19:27;19:31;"and I probably did that to a lot of people, and I don't know."
19:31;19:33;"Maybe I'm just insecure at the end of the day."""
19:33;19:35;"It's not just that he reflected on his behavior."
19:35;19:38;"What really got him is that he actually realized the Stones were good."
19:38;19:40;"You know what I mean?"
19:40;19:44;"Because I'm sure he was probably also terrible to somebody who people don't think is good."
19:44;19:45;"And he was always right."
19:45;19:49;"Right. Yeah. He's like, ""My crucial mistake was not being a prick."
19:49;19:54;"It was being a prick to somebody who low-key was actually a pretty good songwriter."""
19:54;19:57;"""It took me years to understand the secret genius of the Rolling Stones."
19:57;20:00;"Dismissal can be a secret form of arrogance."""
20:00;20:01;"The secret genius."
20:01;20:04;"I know what he means, because when I was a kid, I was like,"
20:04;20:06;"""The Beatles are so much better than the Stones."""
20:06;20:11;"The music is so much brighter and poppier."
20:11;20:16;"It took me a long time to really appreciate the secret genius of the Rolling Stones."
20:16;20:21;"And I know you carry a lot of regret about how you treated Mick Jagger when he came through."
20:21;20:22;"Yeah, man."
20:22;20:24;"That ""Dear Nora"" show in '02."
20:24;20:26;"You know, Mick keeps his ear to the ground."
20:26;20:33;"He popped into the hemlock in SF and got that DN set."
20:33;20:36;"Did I ever tell you this story about this friend of mine?"
20:36;20:40;"And this is the kind of thing that could just never happen in this day and age."
20:40;20:42;"But he was maybe, I don't know, 12."
20:42;20:45;"He was like, I guess they were graduating middle school or something."
20:45;20:50;"And the music teacher sat the class down and said, ""Hey, guys."
20:50;20:52;"It's been a great year."
20:52;20:54;"And I want to leave you with this."
20:54;20:58;"For the rest of your lives, you're going to hear a debate."
20:58;21:02;"Who's better, the Beatles or the Rolling Stones?"""
21:02;21:05;"They're both great bands, and they both have a ton to offer."
21:05;21:09;"Talks about the harmony, the melody, you know, of the Beatles."
21:09;21:14;"And he goes, ""But you can f--- the Stones."""
21:14;21:17;"But this is like seniors in high school?"
21:17;21:19;"No, this is like middle school."
21:19;21:22;"This is like 12-year-olds or 14-year-olds going into high school."
21:22;21:24;"Oh, God."
21:24;21:26;"And he told me this because as a kid, I went to high school with him."
21:26;21:30;"He goes, ""Yeah, you know, I came from this other high school or this other middle school."""
21:30;21:32;"And I will never forget it."
21:32;21:34;"And he said, ""You know, for the rest of my life, I don't think I'll forget that."""
21:34;21:36;"That guy's no longer a teacher."
21:36;21:37;"But, um..."
21:37;21:39;"No, it's real election vibe."
21:39;21:40;"But he was right."
21:40;21:44;"I'm picturing like Robin Williams and Dead Poets Society giving an impassioned speech."
21:44;21:49;"""But you must understand, you can f--- to the Stones."
21:49;21:54;"And never let anybody tell you otherwise."""
21:54;21:56;"Also, I guess if we want to be sympathetic to Morrissey."
21:56;21:58;"I mean, obviously, he is a fanboy."
21:58;22:02;"He famously, in the late 70s, wrote an article for..."
22:02;22:03;"I don't know."
22:03;22:05;"Maybe it was a letter to the NME or something."
22:05;22:07;"Where he wrote..."
22:07;22:09;"The headline was, ""Ramones are rubbish."""
22:09;22:12;"And he was a New York Dolls super fan."
22:12;22:14;"So, this is probably like Morrissey as a teenager."
22:14;22:16;"He was a New York Dolls super fan."
22:16;22:17;"And the Ramones came out."
22:17;22:20;"And people were like, ""Oh, there's this amazing punk band out of New York City."""
22:20;22:24;"And he's like, ""The greatest band out of New York City was the New York Dolls."
22:24;22:27;"And they never got their props. The Ramones are rubbish."""
22:27;22:29;"And I think he eventually changed his mind."
22:29;22:31;"No, he walked it back."
22:31;22:32;"He walked it back and he said..."
22:32;22:35;"""Mia Coppa, the Ramones are not rubbish."""
22:35;22:40;"""When I bought the Ramones' first album on import, I was enraged with the jealousy."
22:40;22:43;"Because I felt they had booted the New York Dolls off the map."
22:43;22:45;"I was 100% wrong."""
22:45;22:46;"That first sentence is so nuts."
22:46;22:49;"That sounds like the way modern fandom talks."
22:49;22:51;"Where people are so invested."
22:51;22:53;"I guess it's good for him for keeping it real."
22:53;22:57;"Picture in 1976, this lad in Manchester."
22:57;22:59;"He listens to it."
22:59;23:01;"And he's enraged."
23:01;23:05;"Not because it somehow affects his career."
23:05;23:11;"But just because another band he kind of likes has slid a little bit down the totem pole."
23:11;23:12;"And he's just like..."
23:12;23:15;"You could just imagine if they had social media back then."
23:15;23:18;"And he was just like, ""New York Dolls fans, suit up."
23:18;23:20;"Because we're going to war."
23:20;23:23;"We need to keep the Ramones off the charts."""
23:23;23:24;"Wow."
23:24;23:25;"It's amazing."
23:25;23:32;"Three days after writing that Ramones piece, I realized that my love for the Ramones would outlive time itself."
23:32;23:34;"And it shall."
23:34;23:35;"I mean, he's just the best."
23:35;23:37;"Well, it virtually has already."
23:37;23:40;"If the Ramones were alive today, they'd be one of the biggest bands in the world."
23:40;23:43;"It takes the world 30 years to catch on, doesn't it?"
23:43;23:44;"I mean, look at poor Nico."
23:44;23:46;"Every modern teenager now seems to love Nico."
23:46;23:49;"Yet while she was alive, she couldn't afford a decent mattress."
23:49;23:51;"I mean, it's great that he's..."
23:51;23:52;"I mean, look at that."
23:52;23:54;"He's talking about Rebels Without Applause."
23:54;23:58;"That's clearly a subject near and dear to his heart."
23:58;23:59;"Because he's a fan."
23:59;24:03;"He's like the Quentin Tarantino of indie rock."
24:03;24:04;"[laughter]"
24:04;24:10;"Like the same way, you know, Quentin Tarantino has his podcast, which is like borderline unlistenable."
24:10;24:12;"Impossible to listen to."
24:12;24:13;"I mean, which I love."
24:13;24:14;"I respect it."
24:14;24:16;"I respect that it's unlistenable, but because..."
24:16;24:18;"It does cut up very well on YouTube, by the way."
24:18;24:23;"I mean, obviously, he's one of the greatest directors of his generation."
24:23;24:25;"He proved all the haters wrong."
24:25;24:28;"Say what you will, but he's like continued to make interesting films."
24:28;24:33;"And clearly just knows movies inside and out, which is why the podcast can sometimes be tough to listen to."
24:33;24:34;"Because he's just talking with his buddy about..."
24:34;24:35;"Oh, no, of course you remember."
24:35;24:37;"1975, blah, blah, blah."
24:37;24:39;"He's talking about these movies that..."
24:39;24:41;"You just have no idea what you're talking about."
24:41;24:42;"Yeah."
24:42;24:44;"And you could almost..."
24:44;24:47;"You could totally see Morrissey having a podcast."
24:47;24:48;"Yeah, yeah."
24:48;24:50;"The Ramones are fine."
24:50;24:51;"Okay, I get it."
24:51;24:53;"They're playing like souped up Beach Boys kind of stuff."
24:53;24:55;"But where it's at is with the dolls."
24:55;24:58;"Now, three years before the Ramones ever come out."
24:58;24:59;"The dolls, man."
24:59;25:00;"They're downtown."
25:00;25:01;"They're wearing dresses."
25:01;25:02;"It's crazy."
25:02;25:03;"I'm 16 years old."
25:03;25:04;"All right."
25:05;25:08;"So I hear the Ramones record."
25:08;25:09;"The first thing my..."
25:09;25:13;"It doesn't hold a candle to the peak of New York Dolls, 1973."
25:13;25:14;"It's just..."
25:14;25:18;"I mean, so I'm just thinking like this is totally, this is totally trash."
25:18;25:20;"And I don't think they ever..."
25:20;25:25;"Yeah, and even just to make a song where you're just kind of like talking about who you consider"
25:25;25:26;"to be the unsung heroes."
25:26;25:29;"I mean, Generation X is the band Billy Idol started in."
25:29;25:30;"So they're..."
25:30;25:34;"And X-Ray Spex, I mean, to me, that's like a pretty famous punk band."
25:34;25:36;"But certainly, they didn't go..."
25:36;25:40;"X-Ray Spex did not have the career of Suzy and the Banshees, for instance."
25:40;25:41;"All right."
25:41;25:44;"For my money, I mean, Suzy and the Banshees, that's the spot."
25:44;25:45;"X-Ray Spex always should have."
25:45;25:49;"First X-Ray Spex album, I mean, absolutely flawless."
25:49;25:53;"And then to do like kind of like a song about it, rewriting history."
25:54;25:56;"♪ I know you're antiseptic ♪"
25:56;26:00;"♪ Your deodorant smells nice ♪"
26:00;26:03;"♪ I'd like to get to know you ♪"
26:03;26:08;"♪ Your dick's frozen like the ice ♪"
26:08;26:14;"♪ He's a junky adolescent ♪"
26:14;26:17;"♪ Cleanliness is her obsession ♪"

26:24;26:27;"♪ He has no wife ♪"
26:27;26:29;"But I guess Morsey came around on it."
26:29;26:31;"I guess good for him."
26:31;26:33;"Sometimes you encounter people with really strong feelings,"
26:33;26:35;"and they can be very off-putting."
26:35;26:36;"Well, I could..."
26:36;26:38;"But one saving grace is sometimes if they say,"
26:38;26:41;"""Hey, I'm just really passionate about stuff, and I was wrong."""
26:41;26:43;"""The Rolling Stones are good."""
26:43;26:47;"And I could see like the Stones and the Ramones kind of have a similar..."
26:47;26:52;"They're both so straightforward, deceptively, I think."
26:52;26:55;"The songs are so..."
26:55;26:59;"There's no artifice or mystery with either band."
26:59;27:03;"And I could see if you're an arty kid like Morsey,"
27:03;27:05;"that just being a turn-off."
27:05;27:09;"The Stones would just be like Bob Seger or something to him."
27:09;27:10;"Yes."
27:10;27:12;"And then as he ages, he starts to..."
27:12;27:14;"""Well, the lyrics are kind of cool."""
27:14;27:18;"""Wow, that tuning he uses is awesome, and the recordings are amazing."""
27:18;27:20;"Right. I wonder what broke it open for him."
27:20;27:22;"Yeah, I wonder."
27:22;27:25;"Side 2 of Tattoo You, dude."
27:25;27:28;"Christmas 19-day 81"
27:28;27:30;"I anxiously unwrap"
27:30;27:33;"The thin square in front of the tree"
27:33;27:36;"It's the vile Rolling Stones"
27:36;27:38;"A new album called Tattoo You"
27:38;27:40;"From my nan"
27:40;27:42;"I put it on"
27:42;27:44;"As I play through side 1"
27:44;27:46;"I feel a nausea"
27:46;27:48;"As if ready to vomit"
27:48;27:50;"I crack the record"
27:50;27:52;"And run out of the house"
27:52;27:54;"Only ten years later"
27:54;27:57;"In a record store in Los Angeles, California"
27:57;28:01;"I finally am acquainted with side 2 of Tattoo You"
28:01;28:03;"I fall to my knees"
28:03;28:05;"And weep"
28:05;28:07;"At how wrong I was"
28:07;28:09;"And how judgmental"
28:09;28:11;"Yeah, I would have thought that, like..."
28:11;28:15;"'Cause Morrissey, you know, he seemingly knows the '60s inside and out."
28:15;28:18;"I would have thought that he would have, like, appreciated"
28:18;28:20;"As Tears Go By or something."
28:20;28:22;"Ruby Tuesday?"
28:22;28:25;"Yeah. But I guess maybe when he was really coming of age"
28:25;28:29;"Was, like, early '70s, and..."
28:29;28:30;"Yeah, I could see why..."
28:30;28:31;"Glam?"
28:31;28:34;"Yeah, he couldn't get into exile, and..."
28:34;28:37;"Yeah, he wasn't into, like, the faces and Rod Stewart."
28:37;28:42;"He was into, like, Bowie and, uh, you know, T-Rex and that kind of stuff."
28:42;28:47;"Yeah, and I guess if you're, like, 13 or 14 when those bands are coming out"
28:47;28:49;"And they're really pushing the envelope"
28:49;28:51;"You see Mick having..."
28:51;28:56;"I could see how that era of the Stones, you might be like, ""What's exciting about this?"""
28:56;28:59;"What is this, like, country rock horse crap that they're doing?"
28:59;29:02;"You know, not appealing."
29:02;29:03;"Yeah."
29:03;29:08;"I wonder if he just, like, caught maybe Wild Horses on the radio one day"
29:08;29:13;"And was just kind of, like, got swept up in, like, the emotion of it"
29:13;29:15;"And realized, like..."
29:15;29:18;"Because that to me is always an example where I think of, like,"
29:18;29:21;"The Stones kind of just, like, down-to-earth poetry."
29:21;29:22;"Yeah."
29:22;29:24;"Where suddenly you have an image of these, like, two English guys"
29:24;29:28;"They've been... had a band for almost, like, eight, seven, eight years now"
29:28;29:31;"And they just sit down and write this, like, beautiful song"
29:31;29:34;"With this central image of ""Wild Horses Couldn't Drag Me Away"""
29:34;29:38;"That's one where you start to be like, ""Oh, yeah, this is, like..."
29:38;29:42;"They're playing with, kind of, cliches and tropes"
29:42;29:44;"But they know how to do it."""
29:44;29:46;"And actually there is, like, a real depth there."
29:46;29:48;"Yeah, no, you're right. I never... Yeah."
29:48;29:51;"The Wild Horse is such a trope, but..."
29:51;29:55;"Somehow they, like, transcend it, which makes it even more powerful."
29:55;30:00;"I remember an early Stones moment for me where I had a real breakthrough was Angie"
30:00;30:05;"I remember I had this, like, radio clock alarm on my bedside table in high school"
30:05;30:10;"And, like, it went off on, like, a Saturday morning at, like, 7.15 or something"
30:10;30:13;"Like, whatever, like, time I had to wake up for school"
30:13;30:14;"I guess it was earlier, probably"
30:14;30:16;"And Angie was on, like, the classic rock station"
30:16;30:18;"And it was, like, a rainy morning"
30:18;30:20;"And, like, there was a skylight in my room"
30:20;30:24;"And, like, I remember just watching the rain, like, pitter-patter off the skylight"
30:24;30:27;"And I listened to, like, Angie in its entirety"
30:27;30:29;"And I was just like, ""Wow. Damn. That's a song."""
30:29;30:33;"That is a tasteful palette, and that's a hell of a song"
30:33;30:37;"I've always thought without... It's not the exact same chord progression"
30:37;30:40;"But I've always thought without Angie, there'd be no Hotel California"
30:40;30:43;"It starts with that A minor to the E7"
30:43;30:48;"Let's throw on Angie, and let's picture Jake on a rainy day in Connecticut"
30:48;30:53;"But let's also picture Morrissey in, like, 1994 in LA"
30:53;30:57;"Like, the Smiths broke up, he still thinks he hates the Stones"
30:57;30:59;"And this comes on"
30:59;31:20;"On a dark desert highway"
31:20;31:23;"Cool wind in my hair"
31:24;31:28;"When will those wildcards disappear?"
31:28;31:35;"Angie"
31:35;31:38;"Angie"
31:38;31:44;"Where will it lead us from here?"
31:44;31:49;"With no lovin' in our souls"
31:49;31:53;"And no money in our coats"
31:54;31:59;"You can say we're satisfied"
31:59;32:02;"But Angie"
32:02;32:06;"Angie"
32:06;32:13;"You can say we never tried"
32:13;32:20;"Angie, you're beautiful"
32:22;32:27;"But ain't it time we said goodbye?"
32:27;32:35;"Angie, I still love you"
32:35;32:41;"Remember all those nights we cried?"
32:41;32:45;"All the dreams we held so close"
32:45;32:49;"Seemed to all go a bit small"
32:50;32:54;"Let me whisper in your ear"
32:54;32:57;"Angie"
32:57;33:01;"Angie"
33:01;33:08;"Where will it lead us from here?"
33:09;33:13;"Beautiful song. And actually listening to it I realized"
33:13;33:18;"It's kind of in that same, um, put in the same folder as, uh"
33:18;33:20;"""I Will Always Love You"""
33:20;33:24;"'Cause it's not just a run-of-the-mill heartbreak song"
33:24;33:26;"""Oh, it ended, I'm sad, or I'm mad"""
33:26;33:28;"It's that thing in the middle, it's like"
33:28;33:31;"""I love you,"" but like, man"
33:31;33:32;"This isn't working"
33:32;33:34;"It is not working"
33:34;33:36;"Like, I don't know what to do"
33:36;33:38;"It's not working"
33:38;33:40;"Like, let's keep it real, we're not"
33:40;33:42;"You can't say we're satisfied"
33:42;33:44;"Which is even sadder"
33:44;33:49;"I hate that sadness in your eyes"
33:49;33:52;"I hate that sadness in your eyes, man"
33:52;33:57;"Angie"
33:57;34:03;"Ain't it time we said goodbye?"
34:03;34:06;"Ain't it time we said goodbye?"
34:06;34:08;"You know, of course, there are other ways"
34:08;34:11;"You can't say we haven't tried"
34:11;34:15;"We've broken up like nine times"
34:15;34:16;"Yeah"
34:16;34:17;"What are we doing here?"
34:17;34:20;"With no loving in our souls"
34:20;34:24;"And no money in our coats"
34:24;34:25;"And we're broke"
34:25;34:26;"Yeah"
34:26;34:28;"You can't say we're satisfied"
34:28;34:30;"He rhymes ""souls"" and ""coats"""
34:30;34:32;"Yeah, and it works"
34:32;34:34;"Angie"
34:34;34:35;"I still love you"
34:35;34:36;"Oh yeah, this part"
34:36;34:38;"They just do this part once"
34:38;34:44;"Everywhere I look, I see your eyes"
34:44;34:51;"There ain't a woman that comes close to you"
34:51;34:58;"Come on, baby, dry your eyes"
34:58;34:59;"It's heavy"
34:59;35:01;"He's breaking up with the greatest woman he ever knew"
35:01;35:03;"I guess circumstance forced it"
35:03;35:06;"Angie"
35:06;35:09;"Ain't it good to be alive?"
35:09;35:11;"But it's a nice ending there"
35:11;35:12;"Yeah"
35:12;35:15;"Angie"
35:18;35:24;"You can't say we never tried"
35:24;35:29;"99 Rock Connecticut's classic rock"
35:29;35:31;"BLR on a Saturday morning"
35:31;35:32;"Jake, you're late"
35:32;35:34;"Oh, it was in the school day?"
35:34;35:35;"I don't remember"
35:35;35:40;"I just, it's very like, like Carl of Noseguard kind of past"
35:40;35:43;"Like, if I wrote my memoirs"
35:43;35:45;"If I wrote a six-volume memoir about my life"
35:45;35:50;"There'd be a 20-page passage about listening to Angie"
35:50;35:54;"As the rain pitter-pattered against the skylight"
35:54;35:55;"That could be amazing"
35:55;35:57;"Yeah, and you like go off on some flight of fancy"
35:57;35:59;"Think about something"
35:59;36:00;"And then you just like come"
36:00;36:03;"Then suddenly a new line in Angie is sung"
36:03;36:05;"And then another 10 pages"
36:05;36:08;"Yeah, it's three pages on like the leaves"
36:08;36:13;"On the maples as they're falling in the autumn light"
36:13;36:16;"And like stories within stories"
36:16;36:19;"Yeah, there's something to hearing that song again"
36:19;36:21;"And thinking about the"
36:21;36:23;"With no loving in our souls"
36:23;36:25;"Like somehow"
36:25;36:27;"It's a little bit contradictory"
36:27;36:28;"He says he still loves her"
36:28;36:30;"But something's broke, is broken"
36:30;36:32;"But then also no money in our coats"
36:32;36:34;"I also kind of wonder if it's like"
36:34;36:36;"They're like, like a guy and a girl"
36:36;36:38;"Some small town just like"
36:38;36:40;"Let's move to the big city, man"
36:40;36:41;"Let's do it"
36:41;36:43;"Oh my God, like I love you so much"
36:43;36:44;"We're gonna make this work"
36:44;36:46;"I got a buddy we can stay with"
36:46;36:49;"And then it's like three months deep"
36:49;36:50;"Nobody found a job"
36:50;36:52;"It's getting weird"
36:52;36:53;"No money in the coats"
36:53;36:55;"And it's just like we tried"
36:55;36:58;"It's an additional stress on the relationship"
36:58;37:00;"It's time to pack it up"
37:00;37:02;"Go our separate ways"
37:02;37:06;"Ain't it time we said goodbye"
37:06;37:08;"Should we listen to that"
37:08;37:10;"That Motown song we were gonna listen to"
37:10;37:12;"That your dad had the 45 of"
37:12;37:14;"Oh yeah, Sweet Soul Music"
37:14;37:20;"Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun"
37:20;37:23;"Do you like good music"
37:23;37:26;"That Sweet Soul Music"
37:26;37:28;"Just only this week"
37:28;37:29;"I love this song"
37:29;37:31;"Who is it by?"
37:31;37:33;"Arthur Connelly?"
37:33;37:34;"I'm a fanboy"
37:34;37:36;"I'm a fanboy too"
37:36;37:38;"I'm going to a go"
37:38;37:41;"Dancing with the music"
37:41;37:44;"Oh yeah, oh yeah"
37:44;37:47;"Spotlight on Lou Ross, y'all"
37:47;37:48;"Lou Ross"
37:48;37:50;"Lonely little boat, y'all"
37:50;37:53;"Sinking low to her to ding dong"
37:53;37:56;"Oh yeah, oh yeah"
37:56;37:57;"That's tight"
37:57;37:59;"This is ""Three Lido"" managed by Amantha's dad"
37:59;38:00;"By my father-in-law"
38:00;38:01;"Oh wow, Lou Ross?"
38:01;38:02;"Yeah"
38:02;38:03;"No, no, Arthur Connelly"
38:03;38:05;"Oh, was he a Capricorn?"
38:05;38:10;"Well no, this is pre-Capricorn when Phil was Otis' manager"
38:10;38:11;"He managed Otis Redding, right?"
38:11;38:13;"He managed Otis Redding"
38:13;38:16;"And Arthur Connelly was his protege"
38:16;38:18;"Oh, interesting"
38:18;38:22;"So he's shouting out Wilson Pickett in that second verse?"
38:22;38:24;"There you go"
38:24;38:33;"He also put him with, he put him with Dwayne Allman"
38:33;38:35;"And Connelly hated it"
38:45;38:46;"Straight up"
38:46;38:48;"James Brown, of course"
38:48;38:50;"The roots of 'em all, y'all"
38:50;38:53;"Oh yeah, oh yeah"
38:53;38:56;"Do you like the music"
38:56;38:59;"That sweet soul music"
38:59;39:02;"Just call me Miss Weenie"
39:02;39:05;"Oh yeah, oh yeah"
39:05;39:08;"I got to get the feeling"
39:11;39:14;"Do you like the music"
39:14;39:17;"That sweet soul music"
39:17;39:20;"Help me get the feeling"
39:20;39:23;"I want to get the feeling"
39:23;39:25;"Otis Redding got the feeling"
39:25;39:27;"Another Otis shout out"
39:27;39:29;"Great song"
39:29;39:31;"Yeah, it's like a pure shout out song"
39:31;39:33;"I guess, like, what else, there's also Genius of Love"
39:33;39:35;"They're just naming people"
39:35;39:37;"I guess James Brown"
39:37;39:40;"I wonder if it was meaningful to him that he got shouted out"
39:40;39:43;"In both Sweet Soul Music by Arthur Connelly"
39:43;39:46;"And Genius of Love by TomTom Club"
39:46;39:49;"James Brown? James Brown?"
39:49;39:53;"'Cause they're just, yeah, in that song they named Bob Marley, Curtis Blow"
39:53;39:57;"There's that, yeah, obviously the Stevie Wonder song about Duke Ellington"
39:57;40:00;"But that's just focused on Sir Duke"
40:00;40:01;"Yeah"
40:01;40:03;"There's definitely like a, it's definitely like a sub-genre"
40:03;40:06;"I'm sure there's a playlist out there on the internet"
40:06;40:09;"Was there ever a band who just shouted out a bunch of bands?"
40:09;40:13;"Yeah, that's what I was thinking, like, what's the, like, Sweet Soul Music version of, like"
40:13;40:16;"Like Brooklyn 2010"
40:16;40:18;"Or like 90s"
40:18;40:21;"Spotlight on Phosphorescent"
40:21;40:23;"Or the 90s"
40:23;40:27;"Do you like grunge music?"
40:27;40:29;"Sweet grunge music"
40:29;40:32;"Sweet grunge music"
40:32;40:37;"Spotlight on Candlebox, y'all"
40:37;40:42;"Spotlight on Layne Staley, y'all"
40:42;40:45;"But you gotta love that positive energy, man"
40:45;40:47;"It's cool"
40:47;40:51;"Pivoting from music, some big news in the Seinfeld fan community"
40:51;40:52;"That's true"
40:52;40:54;"Seinfeld, you wanna speak about this?"
40:54;40:56;"Yeah, no, some crazy stuff happened this week"
40:56;41:05;"Because Jerry Seinfeld was on stage at the Boston Theatre, Boston's Wang Theatre"
41:05;41:09;"Are you guys familiar with the Boston's Wang Theatre? Have you ever performed there?"
41:09;41:13;"No, what is, is it like part of a college or something?"
41:13;41:16;"I don't know, it's just like identified in this headline"
41:16;41:20;"It was opened in 1925 as the Metropolitan Theatre"
41:20;41:24;"And it was renamed the Music Hall, and now it's the Wang Theatre"
41:24;41:30;"So Jerry's on stage performing stand-up comedy, you know, for the masses"
41:30;41:35;"And usually Jerry does a Q&A at the end"
41:35;41:40;"And somebody said something like, ""How'd you feel about the finale?"""
41:40;41:46;"And Jerry said, ""Well, I have a secret for you about the ending, but I can't really tell it because it's a secret"""
41:46;41:50;"And then he went on to say, ""Here's what I'll tell you, okay, but you can't tell anybody"
41:50;41:55;"Something is going to happen that has to do with that ending, hasn't happened yet"""
41:55;41:59;"And then he said, ""And just what you were thinking about, the finale"
41:59;42:04;"Larry and I have been also thinking about it, so you'll see, we'll see"""
42:04;42:09;"And so, you know, this has gotten social media ablaze"
42:09;42:11;"It's all anybody's been able to talk about"
42:11;42:13;"People are really in a tizzy"
42:13;42:18;"Yeah, yeah, people are in a tizzy, for sure, you could definitely call it that"
42:18;42:22;"And I think the whole world is just wondering, well, what's going to happen?"
42:22;42:26;"Are we picking up? Are we continuing from the finale?"
42:26;42:29;"I've seen some people speculate that"
42:29;42:31;"That Jerry get iPad"
42:31;42:33;"I mean, you know, he might"
42:33;42:38;"There's been significant speculation that maybe Jerry get iPad"
42:38;42:41;"He might get iPhone, but don't jinx it, Ezra"
42:41;42:43;"Don't jinx it, because we don't really know"
42:43;42:47;"We don't know what him and friend of the show, LD, have cooking"
42:47;42:52;"But, you know, some people have speculated we might be looking at another Super Bowl ad"
42:52;42:59;"That's what was funny to me, is because Seinfeld always seemed like the show that wouldn't have a real reunion"
42:59;43:05;"Because, what was Larry's famous words about the worldview of the show?"
43:05;43:08;"As they wrote it was, ""No hugging, no learning"""
43:08;43:11;"No learning, no hugging, no learning, yeah"
43:11;43:12;"It's a great ethos"
43:12;43:17;"And something about coming back, it just doesn't seem like the Seinfeld we know and love"
43:17;43:19;"And they did it!"
43:19;43:20;"On Curb!"
43:20;43:21;"They did it on Curb!"
43:21;43:24;"Which was the perfect backdoor way of doing it"
43:24;43:26;"They subverted it, yeah"
43:26;43:28;"Yeah, and that was great"
43:28;43:31;"So, and for some reason this one did seem to make a lot of noise"
43:31;43:34;"I'm sure your phone was blowing up, Seinfeld"
43:34;43:36;"I was getting people mentioning it to me too"
43:36;43:37;"There was excitement"
43:37;43:43;"So, just the idea that this could potentially just be a Super Bowl ad is so funny to me"
43:43;43:47;"Just people being like, ""Oh my god, can you imagine the gang back together?"""
43:47;43:53;"And it's like, yeah, for 30 seconds on Super Bowl Sunday for Arby's"
43:53;44:02;"I mean, honestly, it's so realistic to me that Wieden and Kennedy hired someone to sit in that audience in Boston"
44:02;44:10;"And just say, ""When they do the question and answer, just say this, and then Jerry's gonna say this, and then American Express, the ad will be out"""
44:10;44:14;"Like, it's just so..."
44:14;44:16;"Well, hang on, hang on, hang on"
44:16;44:20;"Let's not give up hope because this could be an entire new season"
44:20;44:22;"It could be an entire new season"
44:22;44:25;"Or maybe they're just bringing the show back, period"
44:25;44:31;"Maybe Netflix said, ""Jerry, if you get the gang back together, as many seasons as you want"""
44:31;44:34;"He's like, ""Yeah, you know, it's been kind of boring the last 30 years"""
44:34;44:37;"And then, for all we know, we'll get another nine seasons"
44:37;44:39;"I mean, that would be the dream, right?"
44:39;44:44;"So many iPads, all sorts of flat screen TVs"
44:44;44:45;"The sky's the limit"
44:45;44:48;"I feel like you'd have to just shut down your Twitter account"
44:48;44:52;"We got New Curb coming this fall"
44:52;44:56;"We got Pop-Tarts, we got the Pop-Tart movie"
44:56;45:00;"I'm really feeling, I don't know if you guys are feeling the vibe shift"
45:00;45:03;"And I'm holding out hope for a few new seasons"
45:03;45:04;"You could be"
45:04;45:07;"But if it was going to be a commercial, what would it be?"
45:07;45:12;"Because I can kind of picture something about, like, maybe it's like a longer commercial"
45:12;45:17;"Where they're, because that's been kind of a trend, is like, they do like a fake trailer"
45:17;45:20;"That's part of the commercial"
45:20;45:23;"Wasn't there like some thing, they're going to do a new Crocodile Dundee movie"
45:23;45:26;"But it's really just a conceptual framework for a commercial or something?"
45:26;45:31;"Like, I could see something, it's like, Larry and Jerry are having a coffee somewhere"
45:31;45:34;"And he's like, ""People really didn't like the Seinfeld finale"""
45:34;45:36;"I know, they just didn't like it"
45:36;45:37;"Should we do a new one?"
45:37;45:40;"And then suddenly it's like this montage of them getting George and Elaine"
45:40;45:44;"And they film it, and then they're back at the coffee shop"
45:44;45:46;"And it comes out, and they read the papers"
45:46;45:49;"And it's like, they like this one even less"
45:49;45:52;"In life you don't always get a do-over"
45:52;45:54;"But with State Farm, something like that"
45:54;45:56;"I could really see that"
45:56;46:01;"Look, that's the practical, that's the realistic expectation for sure"
46:01;46:02;"That's a buzzkill"
46:02;46:04;"I'm going to throw you a little curveball though"
46:04;46:05;"Yeah"
46:05;46:07;"What if it's something a little bigger?"
46:07;46:11;"Usher, Raymond, Super Bowl halftime show"
46:11;46:12;"Right?"
46:12;46:14;"He stops, he's like, ""Stop music!"""
46:14;46:15;"It's like, ""Duh, duh, duh, duh"""
46:15;46:17;"Wait, hold up, hold up"
46:17;46:19;"Out comes, no, no, wait"
46:19;46:22;"The flat-form rises, Taylor Swift style"
46:22;46:25;"It's the entire cast"
46:25;46:28;"Even the secondary cast members"
46:28;46:33;"Oh, and they do a live 15-minute sketch"
46:33;46:35;"In the center of a stadium in Super Bowl"
46:35;46:37;"And also it's so echoey"
46:37;46:39;"But they're reading off the mics"
46:39;46:41;"They're holding mics"
46:41;46:43;"It's a table read"
46:43;46:45;"No, I don't even think it should be"
46:45;46:47;"I really think, they can get mic'd up"
46:47;46:49;"They got the little mics on their collar"
46:49;46:50;"Like a stage show"
46:50;46:52;"And it doesn't even come up from the ground"
46:52;46:54;"It's just like, ""Alright, ladies and gentlemen"""
46:54;46:56;"It's like, ""What's the feature?"""
46:56;46:58;"And then it's just, there's just like a"
46:58;47:00;"You know, like a"
47:00;47:02;"I guess the screen lifts behind them"
47:02;47:04;"And it's just the set of Seinfeld"
47:04;47:06;"And like, Kramer walks in"
47:06;47:08;"And they just perform a scene"
47:08;47:10;"That could be sick"
47:10;47:12;"How many thousand, how many, was it 100,000 people?"
47:12;47:15;"How about this, it's Usher's just going off"
47:15;47:17;"Performing his greatest hits"
47:17;47:19;"And then everybody's kind of, it's kind of weird"
47:19;47:22;"The camera kind of zooms past the stage"
47:22;47:24;"And the music kind of fades out"
47:24;47:26;"Into the crowd"
47:26;47:29;"And you see Jerry, George, and Elaine all bundled up"
47:29;47:32;"People start losing their sh*t"
47:32;47:34;"Kramer comes in"
47:34;47:36;"Holding a giant tub of popcorn"
47:36;47:38;"""Kramer, where'd you get that popcorn?"""
47:38;47:40;"""Oh, I know a guy who works here"""
47:40;47:42;"And then like, you know, the whole thing starts"
47:42;47:44;"And then like, Newman shows up"
47:44;47:46;"And he's like, and Jerry's like"
47:46;47:48;"""How did you get tickets to the Super Bowl, Newman?"""
47:48;47:50;"He's like, ""I have my ways"""
47:50;47:52;"You know, it's just like, the whole thing takes place"
47:52;47:55;"Of the gang came to the Super Bowl"
47:55;47:57;"So we're in the crowd when this is happening"
47:57;48:00;"Exactly, we zoomed way past Usher"
48:00;48:02;"And then we suddenly just watched them"
48:02;48:04;"And then you get, you know, kind of like they do that on SNL"
48:04;48:06;"They put a celebrity in the crowd"
48:06;48:08;"And then all the people, all like the regular people"
48:08;48:11;"Sitting around are kind of going ""Haha, haha, what? Haha"""
48:11;48:13;"You know, it'll be that kind of energy"
48:13;48:15;"And they say, ""How did this happen?"""
48:15;48:17;"And Usher Raymond says"
48:17;48:19;"""When they asked me to do the Super Bowl, I said"
48:19;48:21;"There was only one thing I, there was only one way I would do it"
48:21;48:25;"And it was that if they brought the cast of Seinfeld back together"
48:25;48:27;"And I sort of could use my platform"
48:28;48:33;"You know, as an opportunity to redo the finale"""
48:33;48:35;"Roger Goodell, if you are listening"
48:35;48:37;"And I know you are"
48:37;48:39;"I'm going to give you a note here"
48:39;48:43;"This doesn't work unless it's a full hour-long episode"
48:43;48:45;"I'm talking about 45 minutes uninterrupted"
48:45;48:47;"You know, normally you'd see"
48:47;48:50;"In fact, you know what? You can put some commercials in between"
48:50;48:53;"Put some commercial breaks in between the Seinfeld halftime show"
48:53;48:56;"But I feel like we're looking at an extended Super Bowl here"
48:56;48:58;"To accommodate the glory"
48:58;49:00;"Because I don't think 15 minutes is going to cut it"
49:00;49:02;"That's not a true finale, that's not a pin-it"
49:02;49:04;"You know what? In fact, by the way"
49:04;49:06;"The guys can keep playing"
49:06;49:08;"You can even have the score on the screen"
49:08;49:12;"As long as the camera stays on the gang in their seats"
49:12;49:14;"Doing the show"
49:14;49:16;"You can still have the score changing"
49:16;49:18;"And they can keep playing"
49:18;49:20;"So are you seeing a picture-in-picture situation"
49:20;49:22;"With the game playing during the Seinfeld?"
49:22;49:24;"No, no, no, you can't see the game"
49:24;49:26;"The game continues"
49:26;49:28;"The referees continue to monitor it"
49:28;49:30;"All you really need to do is see the score anyway"
49:30;49:32;"Right?"
49:32;49:34;"I just want to play at this other idea"
49:34;49:36;"Which, do you think that"
49:36;49:39;"You know, there was a lot of conversation"
49:39;49:41;"I think around who could even"
49:41;49:43;"Who is an act that could play the Super Bowl?"
49:43;49:44;"Right"
49:44;49:46;"I'm just thinking, are they thinking small with music?"
49:46;49:48;"And is there an opportunity where you could have said"
49:48;49:51;"You know what? Maybe it's not going to be the whole 22 minutes"
49:51;49:55;"But what if our Super Bowl halftime show was Seinfeld?"
49:55;49:57;"Like a new episode of Seinfeld"
49:57;49:59;"Would people tune in?"
49:59;50:01;"So there's no music, it's just like"
50:01;50:04;"Halftime starts and there's a stage is on set"
50:04;50:07;"And you just watch sort of a stage play"
50:07;50:09;"But it's the Seinfeld, it's huge"
50:09;50:12;"It's like, would America watch"
50:12;50:16;"A funny but 22 minute halftime show"
50:16;50:19;"That was the new finale?"
50:19;50:21;"I love it, and I think that also begs the question"
50:21;50:24;"Because, yeah, people say who's big enough to play the Super Bowl?"
50:24;50:27;"The truth is we're running out of superstars"
50:27;50:30;"Once Taylor Swift does it, it's been done"
50:30;50:33;"And arguably Taylor Swift is too big to do the Super Bowl now"
50:33;50:36;"So I guess my question is"
50:36;50:39;"What is the NFL's sick obsession with music?"
50:39;50:43;"There's so many art forms that you could bring to the halftime"
50:43;50:47;"What is this bizarre obsession with popular music?"
50:47;50:50;"You know, first it always had to be a marching band"
50:50;50:52;"And then they got sick of that"
50:52;50:55;"Now it's always got to be music"
50:55;50:58;"Why can't it be a live performance of a TV show?"
50:58;51:01;"Why can't it be modern dance?"
51:01;51:04;"Why can't it be ballet?"
51:04;51:06;"Why can't it be..."
51:06;51:10;"Imagine if, a tribute to Jackson Pollock"
51:10;51:14;"They just put a big canvas at the 50 yard line"
51:14;51:17;"And then they had art students"
51:17;51:20;"From all around America"
51:20;51:22;"Come out and do a live splatter painting"
51:22;51:23;"I love this"
51:23;51:26;"What is this disgusting obsession with music?"
51:26;51:29;"Music has nothing to do with sports in the first place"
51:29;51:33;"Music and sports, that's not a famous combination?"
51:33;51:38;"No, it's like mixing cucumber and peanut butter or something"
51:38;51:41;"Popcorn and raisins"
51:41;51:43;"No, I mean that's a match made in heaven"
51:43;51:45;"I like where you're going with this though"
51:45;51:48;"Because, look, I did a little number crunching"
51:48;51:51;"Okay, how many people watched the Seinfeld finale"
51:51;51:54;"When it aired on NBC way back in '98?"
51:54;51:55;"76 million viewers"
51:55;51:58;"How many people watched the Super Bowl last year?"
51:58;52:00;"99 million viewers"
52:00;52:04;"I mean the difference between 76 and 99 is negligible"
52:04;52:06;"That's like the same amount"
52:06;52:09;"So what I'm saying is that Seinfeld has already proven"
52:09;52:11;"That he can bring in those big numbers"
52:11;52:12;"Well, not Seinfeld"
52:12;52:16;"The cast, the TV show has proven that it's big enough to do the Super Bowl"
52:16;52:20;"Although, again, why not have stand-up comedy for the halftime show?"
52:20;52:21;"Yes, no, no, of course"
52:21;52:24;"It's halftime, the people want a break from the sports"
52:24;52:26;"Let the guys go drink a Gatorade"
52:26;52:29;"Maybe get a little bit of body work done"
52:29;52:31;"Spotlight on the 50-yard line"
52:31;52:34;"Shane Gillis does a tight 15"
52:34;52:36;"How would you feel about Walter White and Jesse McKee?"
52:36;52:39;"So are we doing like opening acts to the headliner with the Seinfeld?"
52:39;52:41;"Walter White and Jesse"
52:41;52:44;"How would you guys feel about Walter White and Jesse making an appearance?"
52:44;52:49;"You know, Apple Music is producing the halftime show once again"
52:49;52:51;"What does that mean? We're off for January?"
52:51;52:54;"We've got some sway with the Apple Music family"
52:54;52:58;"I think what it means is that we're going to be co-producing this halftime show"
52:58;53:01;"Are you pitching a Time Crisis halftime show?"
53:01;53:03;"First of all, they'd save so much money"
53:03;53:07;"They'd just bring out four chairs, microphone"
53:07;53:10;"And we just do a live Top 5"
53:10;53:13;"I'm begging the NFL, think outside the box"
53:13;53:15;"And I say this as a musician"
53:15;53:20;"I say this as a musician, the people are tired of music always being in that slot"
53:20;53:22;"And you guys, you ran out of superstars"
53:22;53:23;"Sorry, you did it"
53:23;53:26;"And we're not saying it has to be Time Crisis"
53:26;53:27;"No, it could be"
53:27;53:28;"It doesn't have to be"
53:28;53:29;"No, we are saying that"
53:29;53:32;"It could be a true crime podcast"
53:32;53:35;"Dude, a live podcast?"
53:35;53:36;"I love this"
53:36;53:37;"You know what I think it is?"
53:37;53:39;"I think it's an hour of Zane Lowe"
53:39;53:41;"Followed by Time Crisis"
53:41;53:43;"And then, ooh, a fifth chair pulls up"
53:43;53:44;"Who is it?"
53:44;53:46;"Friend of the show, Usher Raymond"
53:46;53:48;"First time ever on TC"
53:48;53:49;"No music"
53:49;53:53;"Just conversation about, you know, Wendy's latest venture"
53:53;53:55;"And that's actually what's happening"
53:55;53:57;"Okay guys, now we spoiled it ourselves"
53:57;54:00;"Hey, Usher, what's your favorite Stones record?"
54:00;54:06;"The Halftime Show is a live Time Crisis featuring guest Usher Raymond"
54:06;54:07;"Peace out, A-Town"
54:08;54:11;"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
54:11;54:13;"Okay, okay"
54:13;54:15;"Usher, Usher, Usher, Usher"
54:15;54:16;"Let's go, Usher"
54:16;54:20;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
54:24;54:25;"Let's go"
54:25;54:26;"In the club with my homies"
54:26;54:28;"Tryna get a little V.I."
54:28;54:30;"Keep it down on the low key"
54:30;54:33;"But you know I'm a E"
54:33;54:35;"I saw this shorty, she was checking up on me"
54:35;54:37;"From the game she was sitting in my ear"
54:37;54:39;"You would think that she knew me"
54:39;54:42;"But we decided to chill"
54:42;54:44;"Conversation got heavy"
54:44;54:48;"She had me feeling like she's ready to blow"
54:48;54:51;"Watch out, watch out"
54:51;54:53;"She said, ""Come get me"""
54:53;54:57;"So I got up and followed her to the floor"
54:57;54:59;"She said, ""Baby, let's go"""
54:59;55:02;"When I told her, I said, ""Yeah"""
55:02;55:06;"Shorty got down, she said, ""Come and get me"""
55:06;55:10;"I got so caught up, I got your tongue"
55:10;55:15;"Her and my girls could be the best of homies"
55:15;55:20;"Next thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming"
55:20;55:29;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
55:29;55:34;"But then, because like a lot of people who get that Super Bowl platform"
55:34;55:39;"You know like when Coldplay, they kicked it over to Beyonce and Bruno Mars"
55:39;55:41;"Because they wanted to use their time"
55:41;55:43;"We're gonna be interviewing Usher"
55:43;55:44;"And then you know what?"
55:44;55:47;"Hey Dax Shepard, you ask a few questions"
55:47;55:50;"Hey Mark Maron, call her daddy"
55:50;55:52;"Everybody gets one question"
55:52;55:54;"And then people are like, ""Oh, okay, I see"""
55:54;55:56;"It's not just about time crisis"
55:56;55:59;"These are kind of like really generous guys"
55:59;56:04;"It's more about just internet radio and podcasts in general"
56:04;56:07;"Jokerman, what's up?"
56:07;56:11;"Steven Heiden, you just started a podcast"
56:11;56:13;"And then fireworks go off"
56:13;56:15;"And that's the third quarter"
56:15;56:16;"What's wrong with that?"
56:16;56:17;"I mean, I love that"
56:17;56:19;"I think we just produced the halftime show"
56:19;56:21;"I mean, to be honest, I think that we could still do this"
56:21;56:23;"Because all they've announced is that it's Usher"
56:23;56:25;"They haven't said what Usher's doing"
56:25;56:28;"But, Usher, why'd you do it?"
56:28;56:30;"He's doing a big press conference"
56:30;56:32;"Guys, am I the only one who's gonna say it?"
56:32;56:35;"We're sick of music at the halftime show"
56:35;56:37;"I could sing and dance my ass off"
56:37;56:39;"But you come see me at my residency in Vegas"
56:39;56:42;"If you wanna see Usher singing and dancing"
56:42;56:44;"What about getting to know me?"
56:44;56:49;"What about seeing me react to the top five songs this week in 1978?"
56:49;56:51;"What about that kind of stuff?"
56:51;56:54;"I've been doing music since the 90s"
56:54;56:56;"I'm speaking as Usher right now"
56:56;56:59;"And nobody ever asked me if I'd even heard of ""Built to Spill"""
56:59;57:01;"Let alone what my favorite song by them was"
57:01;57:04;"And now I get to do that in front of all of America?"
57:04;57:07;"Yeah, that's pretty... that's why I did it"
57:07;57:11;"I get to do that in front of 99 million people"
57:11;57:15;"You know, I wanna say that I have to feel that no matter who's performing"
57:15;57:18;"There's gotta be a serious retention problem"
57:18;57:21;"Whether it's Rihanna, Usher, just keeping people through it"
57:21;57:24;"And just to help with the pitch"
57:24;57:26;"I would say that if we did this"
57:26;57:31;"I think, just realistically, there'd be such a level of confusion"
57:31;57:34;"That I do think people would watch it"
57:34;57:38;"I don't see people turning it off just simply out of uncertainty"
57:38;57:40;"Do you know what I mean?"
57:40;57:43;"I don't think people would be like, ""Oh, gotta go, this is boring"""
57:43;57:46;"I think people would be like, ""I don't know, there was a glitch in the Matrix or something"""
57:46;57:47;"Totally"
57:47;57:54;"And also, we'd have an easier time integrating advertisers into what we do"
57:54;57:55;"Than Usher would"
57:55;57:59;"Because it'd be so weird if just in the middle of the halftime show"
57:59;58:02;"Usher started talking about eating Doritos"
58:02;58:04;"Eating Doritos or talking about Doritos"
58:04;58:06;"But in a conversational format"
58:06;58:09;"We could say like, ""Usher, what's your favorite Frito-Lay product?"""
58:09;58:13;"For instance, or say, ""Usher, when you get the big variety pack"
58:13;58:16;"Of the little bags of the Frito-Lays, let's keep it real"
58:16;58:18;"What's the last one there? Is it Fritos?"""
58:18;58:21;"And he'd be like, ""You know what's funny? For me, no"
58:21;58:24;"It's not Fritos. I eat the Fritos first. Get out of here!"""
58:24;58:27;"""Okay, you don't even have to cut to commercial"
58:27;58:29;"Because we're giving you everything"
58:29;58:31;"What number Super Bowl is this?"""
58:31;58:34;"200? At this point, what is it?"
58:34;58:36;"It's gotta be..."
58:36;58:38;"I think we're in the 50s"
58:38;58:39;"The 200-50s"
58:39;58:40;"200?!"
58:40;58:43;"I think it started in 1969 or '67 or something"
58:43;58:46;"The first Super Bowl was in 1776"
58:46;58:48;"No, I think the first Super Bowl was probably..."
58:48;58:50;"Yeah, I'm guessing early '60s"
58:50;58:52;"Are we at like '60? '50?"
58:52;58:53;"I think '67"
58:53;58:54;"I think it's '57"
58:54;58:55;"Yeah"
58:55;58:58;"Super Bowl 2022 was..."
58:58;59:00;"Yeah, you're right, '57"
59:00;59:03;"So this would be '58 if I'm doing the math right"
59:03;59:06;"Wait, so you're adding 1 to '57?"
59:06;59:10;"If the Super Bowl was a person, they'd be Gen X"
59:10;59:11;"I guess so, yeah"
59:11;59:13;"Late '60s?"
59:13;59:15;"Who's older, the Super Bowl or Eddie Vedder?"
59:15;59:17;"It would be a boomer"
59:17;59:19;"Gen X cuts off at '56"
59:19;59:20;"Yeah"
59:20;59:23;"We're doing young boomer Super Bowl era"
59:23;59:25;"Oh, wait, so you're saying it's '60?"
59:25;59:26;"I'm confused"
59:26;59:28;"Wait, hold on, the math is wrong here"
59:28;59:29;"Yeah, hold on"
59:29;59:30;"Let's slow down"
59:30;59:31;"Gen Z age range?"
59:31;59:33;"No, not Gen Z age range"
59:33;59:35;"What number Super Bowl is this coming up?"
59:35;59:37;"Oh, '58"
59:37;59:38;"What year did the Super Bowl start?"
59:38;59:39;"So what year did it start?"
59:39;59:41;"I mean, it started in 1965"
59:41;59:44;"It started in '67"
59:44;59:46;"It started in '67?"
59:46;59:48;"Oh, because they skipped some"
59:48;59:49;"They skipped some?"
59:49;59:51;"Because of the war in Iraq?"
59:51;59:53;"I don't know, I just have a memory"
59:53;59:54;"Matt, watch this"
59:54;59:56;"Matt, you're the only one"
59:56;59:57;"We can't do the number"
59:57;59:59;"Matt, get on the mic, just explain the story"
59:59;01:00:01;"Just tell us what's going on"
01:00:01;01:00:05;"The Super Bowl started in 1967"
01:00:05;01:00:08;"It was the Chiefs and the Packers"
01:00:08;01:00:13;"It has not skipped a Super Bowl for the war in Iraq or any other reason"
01:00:13;01:00:16;"So that would put us at Super Bowl..."
01:00:16;01:00:19;"I just don't get the math though"
01:00:19;01:00:21;"It should be '57 coming up"
01:00:21;01:00:22;"Super Bowl '58"
01:00:22;01:00:26;"2024 though would have made it started '66, no?"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"Do we not count..."
01:00:28;01:00:29;"The math ain't math"
01:00:29;01:00:33;"I think you're right, they skipped it because of the war in Iraq"
01:00:33;01:00:36;"All the football team owners"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"It just didn't feel right to them"
01:00:38;01:00:39;"Didn't feel right"
01:00:39;01:00:42;"Okay, I don't know why it's '58, not '57, but whatever"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"Which makes it a boomer, right?"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"No, that's Gen X"
01:00:46;01:00:49;"Okay, so the Super Bowl was born in '67"
01:00:49;01:00:51;"What year was Eddie Vedder born?"
01:00:51;01:00:54;"I'm gonna say '64"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"I'm guessing"
01:00:56;01:00:59;"Eddie Vedder is... hang on"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"December 23, 1964"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"Woo!"
01:01:03;01:01:07;"What year was... Kurt was born in '67, I think"
01:01:07;01:01:08;"I think you're right"
01:01:08;01:01:10;"What month was Kurt born?"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"February '67, February 20th"
01:01:12;01:01:15;"Wait, what was the date of the first Super Bowl?"
01:01:15;01:01:19;"First Super Bowl, January 15, 1967"
01:01:19;01:01:22;"Wow, so one month later, Kurt was born"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"'67 is a crazy year"
01:01:24;01:01:27;"I was just talking with Jake actually when we were hanging out about '67"
01:01:27;01:01:30;"So not only did '67 have the first Super Bowl"
01:01:30;01:01:34;"And then Kurt was born a month later"
01:01:34;01:01:36;"But I actually just looked this up"
01:01:36;01:01:39;"We may have talked about this to some extent in the past"
01:01:39;01:01:44;"But I'm gonna name you the artists who released their debut album in 1967"
01:01:44;01:01:51;"Obviously every year you get hundreds if not thousands of people releasing their debut album"
01:01:51;01:01:55;"Every year you could probably find somebody notable release their debut album"
01:01:55;01:01:58;"But check this out, 1967 debut albums"
01:01:58;01:02:11;"The Doors, Grateful Dead, David Bowie, Van Morrison, Velvet Underground, Pink Floyd, Leonard Cohen, Jimi Hendrix, Traffic, and Janis Joplin"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"With Big Brother and The Holding Company"
01:02:13;01:02:16;"I mean that's a crazy year"
01:02:16;01:02:21;"And I didn't even realize that in a sense the Super Bowl dropped their debut album in 1967"
01:02:21;01:02:24;"What was in the water, man?"
01:02:24;01:02:28;"But anyway, the Super Bowl is a Gen Xer, it's slightly younger than Eddie Vedder"
01:02:28;01:02:31;"Basically the exact same age as Kurt Cobain"
01:02:31;01:02:38;"So I guess the last Super Bowl that Kurt watched was Super Bowl 27 in '94"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"Was he watching the Super Bowl?"
01:02:40;01:02:43;"Do we know? Was he an NFL guy?"
01:02:43;01:02:46;"He could track his birthday as well as Super Bowl, that's crazy"
01:02:46;01:02:47;"Who knows?"
01:02:47;01:02:52;"It's funny, I was just on some random like thinking about what music"
01:02:52;01:02:55;"You know what I was just thinking about this week?"
01:02:55;01:02:59;"And this is also maybe proof that time crisis doesn't stop when we stop recording"
01:02:59;01:03:04;"I wonder if Kurt listened to Check Your Head by the Beastie Boys"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"I didn't look it up but it just kind of crossed my mind"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"And then I was like I wonder if Kurt ever heard Sabotage"
01:03:08;01:03:15;"And then I looked it up and actually Sabotage came out like maybe a month after Kurt died"
01:03:15;01:03:17;"So he would not have heard any of Ill Communication"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"I don't know if he ever heard"
01:03:19;01:03:23;"I could see Kurt maybe not even checking out Check Your Head when it came out in '92"
01:03:23;01:03:26;"Because he was like, you know, oh man Beastie Boys"
01:03:26;01:03:32;"I remember that fight for your right to party, that jock rap stuff, not cool man"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"I could see that too"
01:03:34;01:03:37;"I don't think he liked it because I'm finding this Rolling Stone article that said"
01:03:37;01:03:39;"He said white people shouldn't rap"
01:03:39;01:03:42;"Specifically I think pointing to the Beastie Boys"
01:03:42;01:03:43;"What year did he say that?"
01:03:43;01:03:47;"Because that would have also been the Vanilla Ice era"
01:03:47;01:03:50;"I mean unless, I mean that, well, no a few years later"
01:03:50;01:03:56;"There's a list you always see of Kurt's top 50 albums that he wrote out for like some magazine"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"No rap in there"
01:03:58;01:04:02;"Maybe Kurt was saying I don't think white people should rap because I don't think anybody should rap"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"Not a fan of the genre"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"To quote Jerry Garcia, rap's not music"
01:04:06;01:04:08;"The harshest Jerry quote"
01:04:08;01:04:14;"Can't find, it's just a lot of people referring back to something that he said"
01:04:14;01:04:17;"But I can't find the actual source of the quote"
01:04:17;01:04:20;"Maybe Kurt didn't like Check Your Head and he specifically was like"
01:04:20;01:04:25;"You know what, I was a huge fan of ill communication, fight for your right to party, girls"
01:04:25;01:04:30;"I love the kind of satirical frat boy thing that they were doing, I think that was genius"
01:04:30;01:04:33;"They lost me at Paul's Boutique and by the time of Check Your Head"
01:04:33;01:04:37;"I had officially come to my conclusion that white people shouldn't rap"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"He spoke on this in '91"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"Okay so it's before Check Your Head"
01:04:41;01:04:42;"Check Your Head might have changed his mind"
01:04:42;01:04:47;"I'd like to think that Kurt would have seen the So What You Want video on MTV"
01:04:47;01:04:50;"He might have been checking out MTV in '92 right?"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"Or at least be like sitting in a weird"
01:04:52;01:04:54;"He was on it all the time"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"Yeah"
01:04:56;01:04:58;"Maybe Kurt said white people shouldn't rap in '91"
01:04:58;01:05:01;"And then in '92 he heard this"
01:05:01;01:05:05;"And he had kind of a Morrissey and McJagger moment"
01:05:05;01:05:07;"And realized like wow"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"I said white people shouldn't rap but"
01:05:09;01:05:16;"If they can find out a way to fuse punk rock, skateboarding and alternative culture with hip hop"
01:05:16;01:05:19;"In a way that feels true both to themselves and the genre"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"Then I'm down"
01:05:21;01:05:24;"You know dismissal is a form of arrogance"
01:05:24;01:05:28;"So I feel like I've really short changed the Beastie Boys"
01:05:28;01:05:34;"I love this, I'm seeing these comment threads beneath the article that said you shouldn't rap"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"Instead of saying I wonder what they"
01:05:36;01:05:37;"He thought of Check Your Head"
01:05:37;01:05:42;"This comment says I love Kurt but I wonder if he would have changed his mind after listening to Eminem"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"[Laughter]"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"Hell yeah"
01:05:46;01:05:49;"1991 a young man in Michigan"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"Picks up a copy of Rolling Stone"
01:05:51;01:05:54;"And reads a quote from Kurt Cobain"
01:05:54;01:05:57;"Saying white people shouldn't rap"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"He gets so fired up"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"He starts practicing rapping"
01:06:01;01:06:04;"Every day morning to night"
01:06:04;01:06:07;"That boy's name, Marshall Mathers"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"Great origin story"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"I'll prove you wrong Kurt"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"Wait can we hear So What You Want?"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"This still sounds great"
01:06:28;01:06:30;"Yeah I've not heard this in a long time"
01:06:30;01:06:31;"And this is grunge"
01:06:31;01:06:32;"How so?"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"I just mean"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"Distortion pedal"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"It's distorted raw early 90's music"
01:06:39;01:06:40;"Like"
01:06:40;01:06:42;"Yeah"
01:06:54;01:06:57;"Dave Grohl is kind of like nodding his head to this"
01:06:57;01:06:58;"Uh huh"
01:06:59;01:07:00;"Oh"
01:07:00;01:07:07;"Yeah"
01:07:07;01:07:09;"You can't fuck on that"
01:07:27;01:07:29;"I do remember at the time like"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"Like the like the distortion"
01:07:31;01:07:34;"Like basically putting your vocals through like a distortion pedal was like"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"Very like"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"It sounded really extreme to me"
01:07:38;01:07:39;"At the time"
01:07:39;01:07:40;"I mean it's a"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"Even now this is like a big swing"
01:07:42;01:07:43;"Yeah"
01:07:43;01:07:47;"I think one of them is wearing a plaid shirt in the video for this"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"Yeah I can see that"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"That fish eye in the part"
01:08:08;01:08:10;"Sorry Kurt you can't front on that"
01:08:10;01:08:15;"Honestly that guitar part is kind of demonic"
01:08:15;01:08:16;"Yeah"
01:08:21;01:08:25;"I can totally see that as like a weird solo on like a song off incesticide or something"
01:08:25;01:08:26;"Oh yeah totally"
01:08:49;01:08:52;"I'm really curious what Kurt thought of this"
01:08:52;01:08:56;"If anybody has any information send an email to"
01:08:56;01:08:58;"What's the email timecrisis2000"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"8minutecapecod"
01:09:00;01:09:03;"8minutecapecod@gmail.com"
01:09:03;01:09:04;"Oh great"
01:09:04;01:09:06;"Yeah yeah timecrisis2000 the twitter account"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"Yeah 8minutecapecod"
01:09:08;01:09:12;"That's the numeral 8 by the way the numeral 8 not the word 8"
01:09:12;01:09:17;"We are willing to pay top dollar for any information about whether or not Kurt Cobain heard"
01:09:17;01:09:20;"So What You Want or anything off check your head"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"And how he felt about it"
01:09:29;01:09:33;"And I love just like that grungy riff and then into the money mark"
01:09:37;01:09:39;"I mean I bet these guys crossed paths"
01:09:39;01:09:43;"It must have like at some like MTV music awards or something"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"92 93"
01:09:45;01:09:49;"You think they would have been at least in the same room at some point"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"I bet they were"
01:09:51;01:09:56;"The only BC's records I really listened to were that one and then the one after"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"Ill Communication"
01:09:58;01:10:01;"Yeah those two always feel like kind of a pair"
01:10:01;01:10:05;"That one starts with that Cheap Trick sample"
01:10:05;01:10:08;"This is the first song"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"Of our new album"
01:10:10;01:10:15;"Yeah and then the next album has like Sure Shot and Sabotage"
01:10:15;01:10:17;"Both very strong albums"
01:10:17;01:10:21;"Okay I found an article by Michael Azarad"
01:10:21;01:10:23;"Oh friend of the show well"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"Has he ever been on the show? We should have him on the show sometime"
01:10:25;01:10:28;"No I tried to have him on once and I don't know"
01:10:28;01:10:32;"He was in fact he was the one that put us in touch with Jack and Dino"
01:10:32;01:10:33;"I don't think he has"
01:10:33;01:10:35;"He has not been on"
01:10:35;01:10:37;"But he got us in touch with Jack and Dino"
01:10:37;01:10:40;"Yeah when we were doing the Herm Yarl episode I reached out to him"
01:10:40;01:10:41;"That sounds about right"
01:10:41;01:10:44;"I was like you want to come on the show? He's like you should reach out to Jack and Dino"
01:10:44;01:10:45;"And he put us in touch"
01:10:45;01:10:47;"Well Michael Azarad for people who don't know"
01:10:47;01:10:51;"Legendary writer he wrote the great book Our Band Could Be Your Life"
01:10:51;01:10:55;"And he wrote a major Nirvana book Come As You Are"
01:10:55;01:10:56;"Come As You Are"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"And he actually like spent time with Kurt"
01:10:58;01:11:01;"So he wrote in 1992 he was writing for Rolling Stone"
01:11:01;01:11:06;"And he wrote an article Nirvana Public Enemy Beastie Boys Cross The Pond For Reading Fest"
01:11:06;01:11:09;"Oh I've seen footage of Nirvana performing at Reading"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"I think that's a classic right?"
01:11:11;01:11:12;"Yeah they're ripping"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"Pavement was over there"
01:11:14;01:11:17;"I mean so who knows all these people could have"
01:11:17;01:11:21;"That's another Kurt Cobain hypothetical I've pondered to myself"
01:11:21;01:11:24;"What did Kurt think of Slanted and Enchanted?"
01:11:24;01:11:25;"Right"
01:11:25;01:11:28;"He died the month that Crooked Rain Crooked Rain came out"
01:11:28;01:11:31;"He definitely would have heard Slanted at some point"
01:11:31;01:11:35;"It's so interesting because I wonder if Kurt"
01:11:35;01:11:40;"Kurt was so familiar just like you know"
01:11:40;01:11:47;"Malcomus with the independent alternative music of the 1980s"
01:11:47;01:11:52;"I wonder if it would have been hard for Kurt to like give it up"
01:11:52;01:11:55;"Just because he might just like know the references so well"
01:11:55;01:11:59;"Oh you guys like The Fall you guys like R.E.M."
01:11:59;01:12:00;"Okay getting live"
01:12:00;01:12:06;"Yeah the singing is a little bit like Dinosaur Jr. who I'm sure Kurt loved"
01:12:06;01:12:07;"Oh yeah"
01:12:07;01:12:10;"He said he I can't find the album"
01:12:10;01:12:14;"But I'm finding something that said that Kurt Cobain said he listened to"
01:12:14;01:12:17;"The last Pavement album and liked it"
01:12:17;01:12:18;"Okay"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"So I just can't find which Pavement album"
01:12:20;01:12:23;"He had like an advanced copy of Crooked maybe?"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"Can't find which one"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"Is there a date on that article?"
01:12:27;01:12:29;"No no I'm digging I'm digging"
01:12:29;01:12:31;"Oh Matt's got a date"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"'94 so"
01:12:33;01:12:34;"Okay so he heard Crooked"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"Maybe he did have an advanced copy"
01:12:36;01:12:39;"I understand why people don't want to just be out doing interviews all the time"
01:12:39;01:12:42;"And talking about do they like this or that record"
01:12:42;01:12:45;"But you should just maybe have a private notebook with a note"
01:12:45;01:12:47;"Do not open until I'm dead"
01:12:47;01:12:51;"Where you just kind of list this kind of stuff for future generations"
01:12:51;01:12:55;"Just like Kurt going through all the records of '91, '92"
01:12:55;01:12:59;"And just you know maybe just a yay or nay type thing"
01:12:59;01:13:02;"Or just speak on it the way Morrissey did"
01:13:02;01:13:05;"Have opinions and then walk him back if you're wrong later"
01:13:05;01:13:08;"For future scholars studying Vampire Weekend"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"This show will be no help"
01:13:10;01:13:11;"Yeah"
01:13:11;01:13:12;"On Ezra's opinions"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"You'll have to really read between the lines"
01:13:14;01:13:15;"Yeah"
01:13:15;01:13:19;"I think when the show started I was more mostly just concerned"
01:13:19;01:13:21;"Like I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings"
01:13:21;01:13:23;"I don't want to put negativity out there"
01:13:23;01:13:25;"The truth is though"
01:13:25;01:13:27;"We've been doing this a long time and as I've gotten older"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"I really don't have strong opinions"
01:13:29;01:13:33;"You know I have strong opinions on our music and how it should sound"
01:13:33;01:13:37;"But like when I picture a Morrissey who's so in his feelings"
01:13:37;01:13:39;"About like he has to swing between like"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"I hated the Stones, they were vile"
01:13:41;01:13:43;"And I was like weird to Mick Jagger"
01:13:43;01:13:47;"And then years later I felt terrible because I realized they're great"
01:13:47;01:13:49;"I don't relate to either side of that"
01:13:49;01:13:50;"I'm just kind of like alright man"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"Maybe I'll have a moment with it one day"
01:13:52;01:13:53;"Maybe I won't"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"Either way it's just one man's opinion"
01:13:55;01:13:58;"And I like the fact that you're out there doing your thing"
01:13:58;01:13:59;"You know like"
01:13:59;01:14:00;"I just"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"Living that live man"
01:14:02;01:14:05;"Like you know Nick is a huge Zach Bryan fan"
01:14:05;01:14:06;"I've heard a bit on the show"
01:14:06;01:14:09;"I haven't had my Zach Bryan moment personally"
01:14:09;01:14:10;"I haven't listened to a full album or anything"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"So I literally haven't had my moment"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"So I haven't had my Zach Bryan moment"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"But I'm just not gonna"
01:14:16;01:14:19;"I just can't say yet that"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"The idea I heard a few Zach Bryan songs"
01:14:21;01:14:22;"And I come out like a big opinion"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"I would be frontin'"
01:14:24;01:14:27;"Maybe I used to kind of want to like obscure my true taste"
01:14:27;01:14:29;"Out of fear"
01:14:29;01:14:31;"Or kindness or who knows"
01:14:31;01:14:34;"Now this is really how I feel"
01:14:34;01:14:35;"If you're out there"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"It's true to your"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"You know character that you are"
01:14:39;01:14:40;"Like you said it's sort of"
01:14:40;01:14:44;"More a supporter of people just doing their thing"
01:14:44;01:14:45;"Right?"
01:14:45;01:14:46;"I think yeah"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"It's very true to Morrissey's character"
01:14:48;01:14:51;"To be like sort of a judgmental prick"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"And that's who he is"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"And but what's also really"
01:14:55;01:14:57;"You know it's sort of very sweet"
01:14:57;01:14:58;"That he's also willing"
01:14:58;01:15:01;"I feel like a Bredy Stenellis type to be honest"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"I got these really strong opinions"
01:15:03;01:15:04;"I won't even"
01:15:04;01:15:05;"I'll tell you them right away"
01:15:05;01:15:06;"And then guess what?"
01:15:06;01:15:07;"Once they settle"
01:15:07;01:15:08;"Maybe I was wrong"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"And I'm happy to admit it"
01:15:09;01:15:10;"Yeah absolutely"
01:15:10;01:15:12;"It's just an opinion"
01:15:12;01:15:13;"And even then"
01:15:13;01:15:15;"If you truly are trying to get into that"
01:15:15;01:15:17;"That like live and let live"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"Like vibe"
01:15:19;01:15:22;"Not only do you have to be chill about"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"Records that get you excited"
01:15:24;01:15:25;"Records that leave you cold"
01:15:25;01:15:27;"And realize who knows how you'll feel"
01:15:27;01:15:28;"Who knows?"
01:15:28;01:15:29;"These are all just passing feelings"
01:15:29;01:15:31;"Anyway you also have to be okay with"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"The sh*t talkers"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"You know I used to take it more personally"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"If I was like oh somebody in the band didn't"
01:15:37;01:15:40;"Somebody in some other band said something"
01:15:40;01:15:41;"Or wished us ill"
01:15:41;01:15:42;"And I'd always think"
01:15:42;01:15:43;"God why would you do that?"
01:15:43;01:15:44;"I wouldn't do that"
01:15:44;01:15:45;"And even now I'm like"
01:15:45;01:15:46;"Well but they would"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"They're on their own trip man"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"You gotta"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"It's very zen dude"
01:15:52;01:15:53;"You gotta try"
01:15:53;01:15:55;"But one thing I know for sure"
01:15:55;01:15:56;"Is I like so what you want"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"I think it still sounds great"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"And it just"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"I just want to know what Kurt thought"
01:16:02;01:16:03;"Jake what about back in the 90s"
01:16:03;01:16:05;"What did you think about Sabotage?"
01:16:05;01:16:06;"Loved it"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"What an amazing set of voices"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"Yeah"
01:16:10;01:16:11;"And that the fact that they made so many"
01:16:11;01:16:13;"Kind of like important songs"
01:16:13;01:16:14;"Is crazy"
01:16:14;01:16:17;"I vaguely remember like trying to play Sabotage"
01:16:17;01:16:20;"Even when I was like in 8th grade or something"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"With like a band just realizing like"
01:16:22;01:16:24;"Nobody could do the vocals"
01:16:24;01:16:26;"Nobody other than Ad-Rock"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"Yeah I was gonna say the Ad-Rock vocal"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"In particular was just so awesome"
01:16:30;01:16:32;"You wanna hear a cool song that I heard"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"Going down my Beastie Boys"
01:16:34;01:16:37;"Walk down memory lane the past week"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"Can you play Egg Raid on Mojo?"
01:16:39;01:16:41;"I hadn't heard the song in such a long time"
01:16:41;01:16:42;"And I remember"
01:16:42;01:16:43;"It's incredible"
01:16:43;01:16:45;"My friend had their"
01:16:45;01:16:47;"The compilation called Some Old Bullsh*t"
01:16:47;01:16:48;"That was all like"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"It was their 80s stuff"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"When they were like literally like a 15 year old"
01:16:52;01:16:53;"Hardcore band"
01:16:53;01:16:55;"And then they started making their kind of"
01:16:55;01:16:58;"Jokey novelty records"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"This is like before the Beastie Boys"
01:17:00;01:17:01;"As most people know them"
01:17:01;01:17:03;"And a lot of the hardcore stuff is like"
01:17:03;01:17:04;"Kind of like yeah alright"
01:17:04;01:17:05;"It sounds like hardcore"
01:17:05;01:17:06;"But this one"
01:17:06;01:17:07;"One of the hardcore songs"
01:17:07;01:17:08;"Egg Raid on Mojo"
01:17:08;01:17:09;"I heard it and like"
01:17:09;01:17:10;"Sent a chill up my spine"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"Cause like I remember being"
01:17:12;01:17:13;"You know 12, 13"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"And hearing this"
01:17:15;01:17:17;"And like having this like vision of like"
01:17:17;01:17:18;"The young Beastie Boys"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"Being in a New York hardcore band"
01:17:20;01:17:21;"In the early 80s"
01:17:21;01:17:22;"It's a special song"
01:17:22;01:17:25;"Any Beastie Boys like proper fan"
01:17:25;01:17:26;"Knows this song very well"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"And they would even still bust it out"
01:17:28;01:17:29;"Decades later"
01:17:29;01:17:31;"Let's listen to Egg Raid on Mojo"
01:17:31;01:17:43;"Kate Show and Bach on drums"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"It really feels like kids to me"
01:18:08;01:18:09;"Yeah"
01:18:09;01:18:10;"Like it would have been the soundtrack"
01:18:10;01:18:11;"The movie kids"
01:18:12;01:18:13;"Yeah I mean it feels so"
01:18:13;01:18:15;"It feels very young"
01:18:15;01:18:16;"It feels like 15"
01:18:16;01:18:17;"Like they sound so"
01:18:17;01:18:18;"They're talking about like"
01:18:18;01:18:19;"Throwing eggs at somebody"
01:18:19;01:18:22;"That must be what an egg raid is"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"Yeah"
01:18:24;01:18:25;"Did you ever read the"
01:18:25;01:18:27;"Their autobiography"
01:18:27;01:18:28;"Oral History"
01:18:28;01:18:29;"Spike did a lot with it"
01:18:29;01:18:31;"Really good"
01:18:39;01:18:40;"But also like"
01:18:40;01:18:41;"The chords are still"
01:18:41;01:18:42;"Kind of like serious"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"I'm sure they thought it was funny"
01:18:44;01:18:45;"But it's like"
01:18:45;01:18:46;"Like you could totally hear"
01:18:46;01:18:47;"Like a punk song from this era"
01:18:47;01:18:48;"But it'd be like about"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"Something like heavy and political"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"But then you go back"
01:18:52;01:18:53;"And you look and you're like"
01:18:53;01:18:54;"They would bust this out"
01:18:54;01:18:55;"Throughout their career"
01:18:55;01:18:56;"Like they'd be like"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"Tibetan Freedom Festival"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"Like 1996"
01:19:00;01:19:01;"And they're like"
01:19:01;01:19:03;"Bust out Egg Raid on Mojo"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"And then you like see some festival"
01:19:04;01:19:05;"In the 2000s"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"They do a quick Egg Raid on Mojo"
01:19:07;01:19:09;"Great song"
01:19:09;01:19:10;"That rules"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"Egg Raid on Mojo"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"I think that's Mike D on vocals"
01:19:14;01:19:15;"I feel like he definitely had"
01:19:15;01:19:16;"A touch of Ian McKay"
01:19:16;01:19:17;"In that"
01:19:17;01:19:18;"Oh yeah"
01:19:18;01:19:19;"In that vocal approach"
01:19:19;01:19:20;"They're definitely listening"
01:19:20;01:19:21;"To Minor Threat"
01:19:21;01:19:22;"Yeah"
01:19:22;01:19:23;"Seinfeld"
01:19:23;01:19:24;"Is there any information"
01:19:24;01:19:25;"About whether or not"
01:19:25;01:19:26;"Kurt Cobain ever heard"
01:19:26;01:19:27;"Egg Raid on Mojo?"
01:19:27;01:19:29;"Think Seinfeld bailed?"
01:19:29;01:19:30;"No he went to the library"
01:19:30;01:19:31;"To look up if Kurt Cobain"
01:19:31;01:19:33;"Ever heard Egg Raid on Mojo"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"White people shouldn't rap"
01:19:35;01:19:37;"They should make hardcore songs"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"Like Egg Raid on Mojo"
01:19:39;01:19:40;"Mojo"
01:19:40;01:19:41;"Here's a little story"
01:19:41;01:19:42;"Behind Mojo"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"The offices of Mojo magazine?"
01:19:44;01:19:45;"No"
01:19:45;01:19:46;"Mojo"
01:19:46;01:19:47;"So Egg Raid on Mojo"
01:19:47;01:19:48;"Was about one of our"
01:19:48;01:19:49;"Regular customers"
01:19:49;01:19:50;"Mojo was a large"
01:19:50;01:19:51;"I gotta figure out"
01:19:51;01:19:52;"What were the"
01:19:52;01:19:53;"Who he's saying the customers of"
01:19:53;01:19:54;"But Mojo was a large"
01:19:54;01:19:55;"Gregarious"
01:19:55;01:19:56;"Very handsome"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"Ska style doorman"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"And more than one"
01:20:00;01:20:01;"Hip boy downtown"
01:20:01;01:20:02;"Oh he was"
01:20:02;01:20:03;"He must have been"
01:20:03;01:20:04;"At one of these clubs"
01:20:04;01:20:05;"He was a"
01:20:05;01:20:06;"Was the door at a punk club?"
01:20:06;01:20:07;"He was yeah"
01:20:07;01:20:08;"He was like the bouncer"
01:20:08;01:20:09;"At a punk club"
01:20:09;01:20:10;"Or one of the"
01:20:10;01:20:11;"Honestly one of these dance"
01:20:11;01:20:12;"I mean when you read about it"
01:20:12;01:20:13;"They're like going downtown"
01:20:13;01:20:14;"To a lot of these"
01:20:14;01:20:15;"They're hardcore clubs"
01:20:15;01:20:16;"But they're also kind of like"
01:20:16;01:20:17;"Dance clubs"
01:20:17;01:20:18;"He was a genuinely okay guy"
01:20:18;01:20:20;"But his gig led him to being a bit"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"I'm hot and know it"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"One lame vibe indeed"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"So yeah this was them"
01:20:26;01:20:27;"I think"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"Throwing eggs at"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"Essentially a bouncer"
01:20:31;01:20:32;"Yeah"
01:20:32;01:20:34;"Egg Raid on Mojo"
01:20:37;01:20:40;"Big news out of Minnesota recently"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"You guys hear about this?"
01:20:42;01:20:45;"The Replacements album"
01:20:45;01:20:48;"Tim was reissued"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"With a new mix"
01:20:50;01:20:51;"I love that not only is"
01:20:51;01:20:53;"Time Crisis late on like"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"Kind of big picture news"
01:20:55;01:20:56;"We're even late on kind of like"
01:20:56;01:20:59;"Niche independent music news"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"Like I think"
01:21:01;01:21:03;"I think that Tim reissued"
01:21:03;01:21:04;"Kind of like already made a big splash"
01:21:04;01:21:05;"Like three weeks ago"
01:21:05;01:21:06;"Precisely"
01:21:06;01:21:07;"Jake were you excited"
01:21:07;01:21:10;"To hear the Tim remix?"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"Not really"
01:21:12;01:21:16;"I like the Replacements"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"But I don't have like a deep"
01:21:18;01:21:21;"Deep history with the Replacements"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"And I'm also pretty"
01:21:23;01:21:24;"Generally pretty skeptical"
01:21:24;01:21:25;"When it comes to these like"
01:21:25;01:21:28;"Deluxe album reissues"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"I just find them to be"
01:21:30;01:21:31;"Kind of overwhelming and bloated"
01:21:31;01:21:33;"Generally"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"And I usually don't find that"
01:21:35;01:21:37;"The new remastering or whatever"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"Is really that revealing"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"Or edifying"
01:21:41;01:21:42;"In this case"
01:21:42;01:21:43;"You did like it?"
01:21:43;01:21:46;"In this case I did actually"
01:21:46;01:21:48;"Because this was a straight up"
01:21:48;01:21:49;"Like a true remix"
01:21:49;01:21:50;"Like down to the studs"
01:21:50;01:21:51;"Kind of"
01:21:51;01:21:52;"Yeah"
01:21:52;01:21:53;"And I listened"
01:21:53;01:21:54;"I did kind of A/B it"
01:21:54;01:21:55;"I listened to like"
01:21:55;01:21:56;"Because there is on Apple Music"
01:21:56;01:21:57;"You can listen to like"
01:21:57;01:21:58;"You know whatever"
01:21:58;01:22:01;"Like a 2012 remaster or whatever"
01:22:01;01:22:02;"And then you listen to like"
01:22:02;01:22:03;"The new remix"
01:22:03;01:22:04;"And like"
01:22:04;01:22:05;"One of the reasons I've kind of"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"Struggled with the Replacements"
01:22:07;01:22:08;"Over the years"
01:22:08;01:22:09;"Is that like"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"Kind of how I struggled initially"
01:22:11;01:22:12;"With the Smiths too"
01:22:12;01:22:13;"Is that their album sounded"
01:22:13;01:22:15;"Very 80s to me"
01:22:15;01:22:16;"And as like a 90s kid"
01:22:16;01:22:17;"It was tough"
01:22:17;01:22:18;"Like"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"I knew that like the bands"
01:22:20;01:22:21;"Like Nirvana"
01:22:21;01:22:22;"That I loved in the 90s"
01:22:22;01:22:23;"You know"
01:22:23;01:22:25;"They loved R.E.M. and the Replacements"
01:22:25;01:22:26;"And I had listened to like"
01:22:26;01:22:28;"R.E.M. and Replacements records"
01:22:28;01:22:29;"From like the mid 80s"
01:22:29;01:22:30;"And like"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"The palette was rough"
01:22:32;01:22:33;"Like I'm a 70s guy"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"And I'm a 90s guy"
01:22:35;01:22:36;"Right"
01:22:36;01:22:37;"And as has been documented on the show"
01:22:37;01:22:39;"80s is a tough"
01:22:39;01:22:40;"Tough pill for me to swallow"
01:22:40;01:22:42;"And so I've never"
01:22:42;01:22:43;"Like gone"
01:22:43;01:22:44;"I've never had like a deep"
01:22:44;01:22:45;"Deep connection"
01:22:45;01:22:46;"With the Replacements"
01:22:46;01:22:47;"Because of the palette"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"The distasteful palette of the 1980s"
01:22:49;01:22:50;"Yeah man"
01:22:50;01:22:52;"And like it didn't seem deliberate"
01:22:52;01:22:53;"Like"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"It seemed like they were like"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"Recording in a big studio"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"And like weren't in control"
01:22:59;01:23:00;"Of like their sound"
01:23:00;01:23:01;"Like I just"
01:23:01;01:23:02;"I remember always feeling that"
01:23:02;01:23:03;"And the number one thing"
01:23:03;01:23:04;"That's different to me"
01:23:04;01:23:05;"Is the drum sound"
01:23:05;01:23:07;"Because it's the drum sound"
01:23:07;01:23:08;"That above all"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"Marks it as being 80s"
01:23:10;01:23:11;"Like"
01:23:11;01:23:13;"Play the original Bastards of Young"
01:23:13;01:23:14;"And then we'll listen to the"
01:23:14;01:23:15;"The remix"
01:23:15;01:23:16;"Because Bastards of Young"
01:23:16;01:23:18;"Is such a good song"
01:23:18;01:23:19;"Amazing"
01:23:19;01:23:22;"It had a very tasteful video"
01:23:22;01:23:24;"See listen to that snare"
01:23:28;01:23:29;"Like the guitar tone"
01:23:29;01:23:30;"Could live in the 90s"
01:23:30;01:23:31;"Yep"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"And his voice"
01:23:33;01:23:34;"It doesn't matter what reverb"
01:23:34;01:23:35;"You put on it"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"His voice is like"
01:23:37;01:23:38;"A timeless"
01:23:38;01:23:39;"Grungy"
01:23:39;01:23:40;"Punky"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"One of the great rock voices"
01:23:42;01:23:43;"Right?"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"Such a good voice"
01:23:44;01:23:50;"I mean in some ways"
01:23:50;01:23:51;"He's like the original Kurt"
01:23:51;01:23:52;"Just like this like"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"Natural"
01:23:54;01:23:55;"Yep"
01:23:55;01:23:56;"Kind of like rough"
01:23:56;01:23:57;"But like"
01:23:57;01:23:58;"Perfect voice"
01:23:58;01:23:59;"And he could sing"
01:23:59;01:24:00;"Like hit all the notes"
01:24:00;01:24:01;"And be like"
01:24:01;01:24:02;"Really get up there"
01:24:02;01:24:05;"I might take it back"
01:24:05;01:24:06;"To John Lennon"
01:24:06;01:24:07;"But yeah"
01:24:07;01:24:08;"I think Paul Westerberg"
01:24:08;01:24:09;"Is like a cool midpoint"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"Between Lennon and"
01:24:11;01:24:12;"Cobain or something"
01:24:12;01:24:13;"Right"
01:24:13;01:24:14;"Alex Chilton of course"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"But Westerberg is always scratchy"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"Yeah I know"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"And also that's why like"
01:24:19;01:24:20;"The replacements are different"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"From Dinosaur Jr."
01:24:22;01:24:23;"Nirvana is different from Pavement"
01:24:23;01:24:24;"Is that"
01:24:24;01:24:25;"Other bands have like"
01:24:25;01:24:26;"The kind of"
01:24:26;01:24:27;"Slightly more like"
01:24:27;01:24:28;"Laid back"
01:24:28;01:24:29;"Well you said"
01:24:29;01:24:30;"You know like kind of"
01:24:30;01:24:31;"Yeah"
01:24:31;01:24:32;"Intellectual cool guy"
01:24:32;01:24:33;"But these are like"
01:24:33;01:24:34;"And I guess"
01:24:34;01:24:35;"I see what you mean about Lennon"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"Because these are primal screams"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"There's no like"
01:24:39;01:24:40;"Detached kind of like"
01:24:40;01:24:41;"It's not"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"Cool guy in a college town"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"And I love that"
01:24:45;01:24:46;"Dude that has its place"
01:24:46;01:24:47;"I don't wanna"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"I mean yeah we love"
01:24:48;01:24:49;"90's apathy"
01:24:49;01:24:50;"But we also love"
01:24:50;01:24:52;"80's earnestness"
01:24:52;01:24:53;"Midwest earnestness"
01:24:53;01:24:54;"Yeah"
01:24:54;01:24:55;"I mean"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"Midwest earnestness"
01:24:56;01:24:59;"Ok so let's listen to the remix"
01:24:59;01:25:03;"Wow"
01:25:03;01:25:05;"Already huge difference"
01:25:05;01:25:11;"See how much"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"Tighter the screen is"
01:25:13;01:25:18;"Now you can actually picture"
01:25:18;01:25:19;"They could have played this"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"On 90's radio"
01:25:21;01:25:24;"And they could have actually"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"Taken this remix a step further"
01:25:26;01:25:27;"And made it even less 80's"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"But it still is a big difference"
01:25:29;01:25:35;"You can hear the"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"The particulars of his vocal performance"
01:25:37;01:25:38;"Better too"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"Yeah"
01:25:40;01:25:53;"And Kurt"
01:25:53;01:25:54;"I love the replacements"
01:25:54;01:25:55;"Because I forget which song it is"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"I don't have it at the tip of my tongue"
01:25:57;01:25:58;"But there's a song on Unutero"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"That quotes from Androgynous"
01:26:00;01:26:01;"Oh really?"
01:26:01;01:26:02;"The replacement song"
01:26:02;01:26:03;"Yeah yeah"
01:26:03;01:26:07;"Elvis in the ground man"
01:26:07;01:26:19;"I never totally understood"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"That line in the original"
01:26:22;01:26:23;"I just always love"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"In the beginning"
01:26:25;01:26:26;"Dreams unfulfilled"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"Graduate unskilled"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"Such a great couplet"
01:26:30;01:26:31;"Yeah I mean it's almost like"
01:26:31;01:26:36;"It's almost like a Bob Seger song"
01:26:36;01:26:38;"Like in terms of it's themes"
01:26:38;01:26:41;"But it's also like weirdly"
01:26:41;01:26:42;"Ahead of his time to say"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"I mean dreams unfulfilled"
01:26:44;01:26:47;"It's pretty Bruce"
01:26:47;01:26:48;"That could be anybody but"
01:26:48;01:26:50;"Graduate unskilled is so good"
01:26:51;01:26:52;"Because it's like"
01:26:52;01:26:53;"It's not about being a dropout"
01:26:53;01:26:54;"Or not graduating"
01:26:54;01:26:55;"It's actually ahead of it's time"
01:26:55;01:26:56;"To be like"
01:26:56;01:26:57;"What if I told you"
01:26:57;01:26:59;"That education would be so"
01:26:59;01:27:00;"Kind of like devalued"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"And the economy would be so crazy"
01:27:02;01:27:03;"That you graduate"
01:27:03;01:27:04;"And you're still not skilled enough"
01:27:04;01:27:05;"To do anything"
01:27:05;01:27:07;"It's kind of like a new idea"
01:27:07;01:27:08;"Yeah that's heavy"
01:27:08;01:27:09;"It's a little bit Sopranos vibes"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"Didn't get in on the ground floor man"
01:27:12;01:27:13;"The ones who love us least"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"Are the ones who will die to please"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"That's just an eternally good lyric"
01:27:17;01:27:18;"The ones who love us least"
01:27:18;01:27:20;"Are the ones who will die to please"
01:27:20;01:27:21;"Yeah"
01:27:21;01:27:22;"That would hit in any era"
01:27:22;01:27:23;"Yep"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"We are the sons of no one"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"That's the reason we're here"
01:27:27;01:27:32;"We are the sons of no one"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"That's the reason we're here"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"We are the sons of no one"
01:27:36;01:27:38;"That's the reason we're here"
01:27:38;01:27:40;"We are the sons of no one"
01:27:40;01:27:42;"That's the reason we're here"
01:27:42;01:27:46;"We are the sons of no one"
01:27:46;01:27:47;"My favorite song on this record"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"might be Swingin' Party"
01:27:49;01:27:50;"Oh yeah"
01:27:50;01:27:51;"And that Swingin' Party"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"really is set a moment"
01:27:52;01:27:54;"with the younger generation"
01:27:54;01:27:55;"It has"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"Let's throw on Swingin' Party"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"Because this is time crisis"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"we're not here to tell you about"
01:28:01;01:28:04;"a classic alternative album"
01:28:04;01:28:05;"No"
01:28:05;01:28:06;"from the 80s"
01:28:06;01:28:08;"even though it is a very strong album"
01:28:08;01:28:10;"We're here to talk about"
01:28:10;01:28:12;"corporate food history"
01:28:12;01:28:13;"I love this one"
01:28:13;01:28:14;"Swingin' Party playing underneath"
01:28:14;01:28:16;"It's a great combo"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"Yeah, I mean, Ezra"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"you dropped a bombshell on the thread"
01:28:19;01:28:20;"about a week ago"
01:28:20;01:28:21;"Yeah"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"I was out in western New York"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"in an area that had some Tim Hortons"
01:28:25;01:28:26;"And I did some digging"
01:28:26;01:28:27;"and I was like"
01:28:27;01:28:28;"because I was like"
01:28:28;01:28:30;"Oh, is this part of New York?"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"about an hour from Buffalo"
01:28:32;01:28:33;"And I was wondering"
01:28:33;01:28:34;"like, well, is this part of New York"
01:28:34;01:28:35;"always had Tim Hortons?"
01:28:35;01:28:36;"Because it's close to Canada"
01:28:36;01:28:37;"No, this particular area"
01:28:37;01:28:38;"these were pretty brand new"
01:28:38;01:28:39;"because Tim Hortons"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"is making a big push in the States"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"And anyway, while I was there"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"that was my local coffee shop"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"had a lot of great coffees at Timmy's"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"and I tried their omelet bites"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"which were pretty good too"
01:28:50;01:28:52;"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait"
01:28:52;01:28:53;"They're doing omelet bites now?"
01:28:53;01:28:54;"Yeah, they're doing omelet bites"
01:28:54;01:28:55;"Damn"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"They have two types of omelet bites"
01:28:57;01:28:58;"It's great if you want to have"
01:28:58;01:28:59;"a kind of protein type breakfast"
01:28:59;01:29:02;"Do they call it a bit or a bite?"
01:29:02;01:29:03;"I think a bite"
01:29:03;01:29:04;"Yeah, because they have Timbits"
01:29:04;01:29:05;"Omelet bits"
01:29:05;01:29:06;"I just feel like you'd"
01:29:06;01:29:07;"Omelet bits"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"I mean, it doesn't sound as appealing"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"They should have just called them"
01:29:10;01:29:12;"They should have called them lit bits"
01:29:12;01:29:14;"Do you say omlet or omlet?"
01:29:14;01:29:15;"I say omlet"
01:29:15;01:29:16;"Omlet, omlet"
01:29:16;01:29:17;"Omlet, yeah, it's lit"
01:29:17;01:29:18;"Lit bit"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Omlet, omlet, omlet, omlet"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"A lit bit doesn't"
01:29:22;01:29:23;"I don't know"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"I'd like a glass of orange juice"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"and an omelet"
01:29:27;01:29:28;"So I was eating lit bits"
01:29:28;01:29:30;"and drinking great coffee"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"at Tim Hortons"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"and maybe this Replacements album"
01:29:34;01:29:38;"was on my mind because of the reissue"
01:29:38;01:29:43;"and the de-80sfication of the remix"
01:29:43;01:29:44;"So whatever"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"I was thinking about the Replacements a bit"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"and then I'm sitting"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"with my Tim Hortons coffee"
01:29:50;01:29:53;"looking at the beautiful red cup"
01:29:53;01:29:56;"with the white Tim Hortons logo on it"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"and then I just realized"
01:29:58;01:29:59;"Wait a second"
01:29:59;01:30:02;"This is the exact same font"
01:30:02;01:30:04;"and writing as the Replacements album"
01:30:04;01:30:06;"and I look at the Replacements cover"
01:30:06;01:30:07;"where it says Tim"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"and then I look back at the cup"
01:30:09;01:30:11;"and I say this is exactly the same man"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"They got the Tim from Tim Hortons"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"So immediately"
01:30:15;01:30:17;"I hit up the boys on the thread"
01:30:17;01:30:18;"We're doing some digging"
01:30:18;01:30:19;"Well hold on a sec"
01:30:19;01:30:21;"When was the first"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Tim Hortons opened in America?"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"And anybody who's listening"
01:30:24;01:30:25;"I encourage you just"
01:30:25;01:30:27;"look at the Replacements album"
01:30:27;01:30:28;"then look up Tim Hortons logo"
01:30:28;01:30:29;"It's the same"
01:30:29;01:30:30;"and it's the same word"
01:30:30;01:30:31;"Tim"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"It's so similar"
01:30:33;01:30:34;"And so we're doing some digging"
01:30:34;01:30:35;"Well hold on"
01:30:35;01:30:36;"Did they have Tim Hortons"
01:30:36;01:30:37;"in Minnesota in the 80s?"
01:30:37;01:30:38;"That sounds like something"
01:30:38;01:30:39;"that could be true"
01:30:39;01:30:40;"But it's not"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"I was thoroughly convinced"
01:30:42;01:30:43;"for like 10 minutes"
01:30:43;01:30:44;"that like"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"Yes, of course"
01:30:46;01:30:47;"That's why they named it"
01:30:47;01:30:49;"And also because like"
01:30:49;01:30:51;"you know, they did Let It Be"
01:30:51;01:30:52;"which is like a cheeky reference"
01:30:52;01:30:54;"to like the Beatles obviously"
01:30:54;01:30:56;"They're not afraid of like"
01:30:56;01:30:58;"naming their records after things"
01:30:58;01:31:00;"After like really funny things"
01:31:00;01:31:01;"Right"
01:31:01;01:31:02;"Yes, you could totally picture"
01:31:02;01:31:03;"Even like Pleased to Meet Me"
01:31:03;01:31:04;"sounds like something"
01:31:04;01:31:05;"I don't know"
01:31:05;01:31:06;"So like"
01:31:06;01:31:07;"I was like yeah, of course"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"It's definitely named after Tim"
01:31:09;01:31:10;"Tim Hortons"
01:31:10;01:31:11;"Like"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"Hey Paul, you wanna go get some donuts"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"from that new Canadian chain"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"that opened in St. Paul?"
01:31:17;01:31:18;"Yeah man, let's check it out"
01:31:18;01:31:20;"It's like man, I really like this"
01:31:20;01:31:22;"Tim, who the hell is Tim Horton?"
01:31:22;01:31:23;"I don't know man"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"Should we call our album Tim Horton?"
01:31:25;01:31:27;"Yeah, let's call our album Tim Horton"
01:31:27;01:31:28;"No, I gotta"
01:31:28;01:31:29;"Let's just call it Tim"
01:31:29;01:31:30;"You could see it"
01:31:30;01:31:31;"But it turns out"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"there was no Tim Hortons"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"in Minnesota"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"until 2016"
01:31:37;01:31:38;"Yeah, I gotta hear it"
01:31:38;01:31:39;"The first two Tim Hortons in the US"
01:31:39;01:31:41;"opened in Florida in 1981"
01:31:41;01:31:43;"but were closed shortly thereafter"
01:31:43;01:31:46;"How hard is it to believe"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"that they would have just did like a little"
01:31:48;01:31:50;"you know, trip up north?"
01:31:50;01:31:51;"Well, they might have"
01:31:51;01:31:52;"We'll get to that"
01:31:52;01:31:53;"I mean, this isn't"
01:31:53;01:31:54;"They're not in Florida"
01:31:54;01:31:55;"Hold on, hold on"
01:31:55;01:31:56;"First of all, I gotta say"
01:31:56;01:31:57;"I gotta say though"
01:31:57;01:31:58;"just that piece"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"that the first two Tim Hortons in the US"
01:32:00;01:32:02;"opened in Florida in '81"
01:32:02;01:32:04;"and almost immediately closed"
01:32:04;01:32:06;"I mean, I guess"
01:32:06;01:32:07;"whoever was running Tim Hortons at the time"
01:32:07;01:32:11;"was not a big fan of military strategy"
01:32:11;01:32:14;"First of all, there's nothing but enemy territory"
01:32:14;01:32:17;"between Florida and Canada"
01:32:17;01:32:18;"That's true"
01:32:18;01:32:20;"And now, your trucking route"
01:32:20;01:32:22;"you're so far from the home base"
01:32:22;01:32:23;"I think that's"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"it's called a forward operating base"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"where you just kind of drop your guys"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"out in the middle of nowhere"
01:32:29;01:32:30;"and say good luck"
01:32:30;01:32:33;"But you need some serious strategy to do that"
01:32:33;01:32:36;"because you need a way to get them supplies"
01:32:36;01:32:37;"I don't know"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"They opened their forward operating base"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"way too deep"
01:32:41;01:32:42;"and it's crazy to me"
01:32:42;01:32:43;"that they didn't make"
01:32:43;01:32:46;"some strategic incursions"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"into like, you know, Vermont"
01:32:48;01:32:49;"Washington State"
01:32:49;01:32:52;"or maybe Montana, North Dakota"
01:32:52;01:32:53;"Minnesota"
01:32:53;01:32:54;"Yeah, Minnesota"
01:32:54;01:32:57;"These are not particularly dense states"
01:32:57;01:32:58;"that are also poorly defended"
01:32:58;01:32:59;"I mean, Vermont"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"Timmy could have made it in there"
01:33:01;01:33:02;"Yeah"
01:33:02;01:33:03;"Totally"
01:33:03;01:33:04;"So anyway"
01:33:04;01:33:06;"I love the backstory about why"
01:33:06;01:33:08;"the first two Tim Hortons in America"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"opened in Florida in '81"
01:33:10;01:33:12;"because that to me is just nuts"
01:33:12;01:33:14;"Can I suggest it's for the snowbirds?"
01:33:14;01:33:17;"It's an outpost for the snowbirds"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"Oh, ooh, okay"
01:33:19;01:33:20;"Flying from Canada"
01:33:20;01:33:21;"Okay, we got a lot of them"
01:33:21;01:33:22;"Venturing"
01:33:22;01:33:23;"Right?"
01:33:23;01:33:24;"I'm bringing a little Canadian knowledge"
01:33:25;01:33:28;"I'm trying to bring a little Canadian theory"
01:33:28;01:33:29;"That's really smart"
01:33:29;01:33:30;"No, I mean"
01:33:30;01:33:31;"I mean, I could be wrong"
01:33:31;01:33:32;"Sally, what the"
01:33:32;01:33:33;"Hey, Sally, what the hell is a Cuban"
01:33:33;01:33:34;"Wait"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"I can't do the bad Canadian accent"
01:33:36;01:33:39;"Hey, Sally, what the hell is a Cuban coffee?"
01:33:39;01:33:40;"I don't want a Cuban"
01:33:40;01:33:41;"What is a Cuban coffee?"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"I don't want to drink a Cuban coffee"
01:33:43;01:33:44;"Where's the Tim Hortons?"
01:33:44;01:33:46;"I want Timmy's"
01:33:46;01:33:47;"I don't want a Cuban"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"What's a Cuban sandwich?"
01:33:49;01:33:50;"I want a Tim Hortons sandwich"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"Cafe Galeche"
01:33:52;01:33:53;"Cafe Galeche"
01:33:53;01:33:55;"The what?"
01:33:55;01:33:59;"Well, in my mind, the album Tim by the Replacements"
01:33:59;01:34:02;"Was inspired and named after Tim Hortons"
01:34:02;01:34:04;"I don't care what the facts say"
01:34:04;01:34:05;"It's an emotional truth"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"Is it possible that it's the other way?"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"Let's go a step further"
01:34:09;01:34:14;"Is it possible that Tim Hortons was named after Tim the album by the Replacements?"
01:34:14;01:34:15;"No"
01:34:15;01:34:16;"It's very possible"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"The timeline doesn't quite add up"
01:34:18;01:34:19;"No, I think"
01:34:19;01:34:20;"Wait, hold on, let's go a step further"
01:34:20;01:34:24;"Because, you know, I really thought I just, like, cracked something insane"
01:34:24;01:34:30;"Of course it turns out that many Canadian Replacements fans have been noticing this forever"
01:34:30;01:34:32;"So at least I felt justified"
01:34:32;01:34:36;"I'm not the only one who thinks this is basically the exact same font and the same word"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"We did a little, you know"
01:34:38;01:34:41;"Could the Replacements have known about Tim Hortons?"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"The answer is sure"
01:34:43;01:34:49;"Their first concert in Canada was in September '84 in Windsor, Ontario"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"At the University of Windsor"
01:34:51;01:34:52;"That tracks"
01:34:52;01:34:55;"That was before the album Tim came out"
01:34:55;01:34:58;"There are currently 41 Tim Hortons in Windsor"
01:34:58;01:35:01;"We can't say for sure how many Tim Hortons there were in Windsor in '84"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"But I'm betting a few"
01:35:03;01:35:04;"But then here's the thing"
01:35:04;01:35:08;"I found an actual article about all this"
01:35:08;01:35:12;"And by the way, the Tim Horton logo is based on the real-life Tim Horton signature"
01:35:12;01:35:15;"Because Tim Horton was a famous NHL player"
01:35:15;01:35:18;"And it barely has changed since those days"
01:35:18;01:35:21;"So it's not like this is just a..."
01:35:21;01:35:24;"I don't know, it's not like they're using"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"I don't know, like the New York Times font"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"Or Helvetica or something"
01:35:28;01:35:29;"You know what I mean?"
01:35:29;01:35:32;"It's like this is a font based on the guy's handwriting"
01:35:32;01:35:35;"Wait, wait, wait, but my man's handwriting looks like a font"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"It's a little too clean"
01:35:37;01:35:40;"No, no, it's based on it, but it's designed"
01:35:40;01:35:43;"I'm looking at this, it says it was designed"
01:35:43;01:35:46;"They smoothed it out, they quantized it"
01:35:46;01:35:50;"Jeff Halpin is, I think, the designer of the font"
01:35:50;01:35:52;"Jeff Halpin and Turner Duckworth"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"Okay, so Halpin takes the font, okay"
01:35:54;01:35:58;"They based the font off of his signature"
01:35:58;01:35:59;"Okay, okay"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"But check this out"
01:36:01;01:36:05;"There's a whole article about the album cover"
01:36:05;01:36:10;"Which was designed by Deborah DeSteffen"
01:36:10;01:36:13;"And there's an article where they actually interviewed her"
01:36:13;01:36:16;"I think Robert Longo did the paintings"
01:36:16;01:36:18;"And she kind of like laid it out"
01:36:18;01:36:23;"So when asked in 2013 if the cover had any ties to the Tim Hortons logo"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"She said, ""Absolutely not"
01:36:25;01:36:28;"I've just learned of Tim Hortons in the last year or two"
01:36:28;01:36:30;"I think I saw it in Penn Station in New York"""
01:36:30;01:36:32;"So she really shut it down"
01:36:32;01:36:34;"And you know, I saw that, I was a bit deflated"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"And I said, ""Well, I guess there's no connection"""
01:36:36;01:36:39;"But then the more I look at it, it's so similar"
01:36:39;01:36:40;"And the word is the same"
01:36:40;01:36:41;"I'm a Tim-truther"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"I might be a Tim-truther too"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"And also I was thinking about, you know"
01:36:45;01:36:48;"With all due respect to the designer"
01:36:48;01:36:51;"Is it possible that she or somebody on her team"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"Did kind of yank it from Tim Hortons"
01:36:53;01:36:56;"And maybe all these years later someone comes snooping around"
01:36:56;01:36:57;"Saying, ""Did you use it?"""
01:36:57;01:37:01;"Because, you know, sometimes you do have to actually license fonts and stuff"
01:37:01;01:37:02;"So who knows?"
01:37:02;01:37:05;"Maybe she just didn't want a headache or to cause problems for the band"
01:37:05;01:37:08;"And she was like, ""I've literally never heard of that"""
01:37:08;01:37:09;"I don't know"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"Alright, here, I think we're getting closer"
01:37:11;01:37:15;"Guys, according to the liner notes from the ""Let It Bleed"" edition"
01:37:15;01:37:18;"Tim took its name from a patch on a thrift store jacket"
01:37:18;01:37:20;"That Bob Stinson liked to wear"
01:37:20;01:37:23;"According to his brother and bandmate Tommy"
01:37:23;01:37:26;"So who's to say the jacket wasn't a Tim Hortons jacket?"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"Maybe it was a Tim Hortons uniform jacket"
01:37:28;01:37:30;"That's exactly"
01:37:30;01:37:34;"And maybe they sent a picture to the designer saying"
01:37:34;01:37:36;"""Oh yeah, this is the jacket we based it off of"""
01:37:36;01:37:37;"And she was like, ""Oh, cool font"""
01:37:37;01:37:39;"I don't know"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"And if it is just a coincidence"
01:37:41;01:37:45;"Then the universe is trying to tell us something"
01:37:45;01:37:48;"You know, some people say there are no coincidences"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"I don't know if that's true"
01:37:50;01:37:54;"But this type of coincidence, it still means something"
01:37:54;01:37:58;"It means that the spirit of the replacements is alive at Tim Hortons"
01:37:58;01:38:01;"I'm looking at some vintage eBay Tim Hortons jackets"
01:38:01;01:38:06;"That look cool, absolutely like someone in the replacements would wear"
01:38:06;01:38:10;"And it just says Tim Hortons right on the chest"
01:38:10;01:38:12;"Logo, absolutely"
01:38:12;01:38:14;"How about this?"
01:38:14;01:38:16;"A punk rocker from Windsor, Ontario"
01:38:16;01:38:20;"Took their older brother's Tim Hortons jacket"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"Stitched out the Hortons"
01:38:22;01:38:24;"Because their name was Tim"
01:38:24;01:38:27;"Imagine you're an Ontario based punk rocker"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"In the 1980s named Tim"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"And you grab your brother's jacket"
01:38:31;01:38:34;"You stitch out the Hortons so it just says your name"
01:38:34;01:38:39;"Then you cover it in like punk patches and stuff"
01:38:39;01:38:41;"You leave it at a party in Minneapolis"
01:38:41;01:38:43;"Ends up in a thrift store"
01:38:43;01:38:46;"Bob Stinson buys it, he's wearing it all the time"
01:38:46;01:38:48;"Sends a picture to the designer"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"There could be something there"
01:38:50;01:38:52;"What you're saying isn't even that far fetched"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"I think that has to have happened"
01:38:54;01:38:58;"There's no way that they have the same font"
01:38:58;01:39:00;"We know they're in Minneapolis"
01:39:00;01:39:03;"We know they're not far from the Canadian border"
01:39:03;01:39:09;"We know that easily that jacket can make its way to a thrift store in Minneapolis"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"There's a lot of circumstantial evidence"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"I understand but I'm saying"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"We don't have a smoking gun but yes"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"This is our chaos"
01:39:17;01:39:20;"We know that it doesn't end with us cracking the case"
01:39:20;01:39:24;"And it's very possible that Debra DeStefano is telling 100% the truth"
01:39:24;01:39:26;"She doesn't want the smoke either"
01:39:26;01:39:28;"She's like no I didn't do it"
01:39:28;01:39:30;"Also this is her recollection 40 years later"
01:39:30;01:39:32;"Exactly"
01:39:32;01:39:33;"I don't know about that"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"Maybe she was busy with other elements of the design"
01:39:35;01:39:38;"And she doesn't exactly remember where the font came from"
01:39:38;01:39:40;"I believe her that she never heard of Tim Hortons"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"Until the 2010s"
01:39:42;01:39:44;"But that doesn't change all this"
01:39:44;01:39:46;"Bring your own lampshade"
01:39:46;01:39:48;"Somewhere there's a party"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"Here it's never ending"
01:39:50;01:39:53;"Can't remember when it started"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"Pass around the lampshade"
01:39:55;01:39:59;"There'll be plenty enough room in jail"
01:40:01;01:40:03;"If being wrong's a crime"
01:40:03;01:40:06;"I'm serving forever"
01:40:06;01:40:08;"If being strong's your kind"
01:40:08;01:40:13;"Then I need help here with this feather"
01:40:13;01:40:22;"If being afraid is a crime"
01:40:22;01:40:27;"We hang side by side"
01:40:27;01:40:34;"At the swinging party down the line"
01:40:34;01:40:37;"Are you saying though that a graphic designer"
01:40:37;01:40:43;"Their whole world is seeing logos, iconography, semiotic symbolism in the world"
01:40:43;01:40:50;"Is not aware of the corporate iconography of the most popular coffee chain in Canada"
01:40:50;01:40:56;"I believe that she believes that she doesn't know"
01:40:56;01:40:59;"I think that you see that cover"
01:40:59;01:41:01;"We have to get her travel records from the 80s"
01:41:01;01:41:04;"Did you ever step foot in Canada?"
01:41:04;01:41:06;"Cause maybe she was like, you know what?"
01:41:06;01:41:12;"I did go to a wedding in Toronto in like late '84"
01:41:12;01:41:15;"Is this a Freedom of Information Act request?"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"Can we check the files?"
01:41:17;01:41:21;"But like you said, maybe she or somebody else on the team"
01:41:21;01:41:24;"Just clocked it and didn't even think about it"
01:41:24;01:41:26;"We're not trying to bust anybody by the way"
01:41:26;01:41:28;"This is cool man"
01:41:28;01:41:30;"We're not trying to bust anybody, okay?"
01:41:30;01:41:32;"It's actually pretty cool, you know?"
01:41:32;01:41:35;"Like, you know, Policeman's 1985, like Tim Hortons"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"That was some of the best coffee around, man"
01:41:37;01:41:39;"You know, when I first moved to Canada, man"
01:41:39;01:41:41;"And I was even just doing like Tim Hortons"
01:41:41;01:41:43;"You know, for the first time I had like a Timbit, man"
01:41:43;01:41:44;"I was like, okay, you know what?"
01:41:44;01:41:46;"I'm not going back to Dunkin, man, you know?"
01:41:46;01:41:49;"We're not trying to prove that somebody's lying"
01:41:49;01:41:51;"Let's be clear about that"
01:41:51;01:41:52;"There's no bad guy here"
01:41:52;01:41:55;"I would actually say this is a story with nothing but good guys"
01:41:55;01:41:58;"Because you got a great record and a great coffee"
01:41:58;01:41:59;"And it's a cool connection"
01:41:59;01:42:01;"So we're not trying to bust anybody"
01:42:01;01:42:04;"We're just saying, is it possible, like you said"
01:42:04;01:42:08;"Could a designer who's just sees the world"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"Like you said, through fonts and images"
01:42:10;01:42:13;"They might just take all this stuff in and it leaves an imprint"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"And they're not using their conscious mind"
01:42:15;01:42:16;"Because they're an artist"
01:42:16;01:42:19;"Right, it's like when Elaine Bennis accidentally copies a Ziggy"
01:42:19;01:42:22;"But that's even more subliminal"
01:42:22;01:42:24;"This is interesting"
01:42:24;01:42:27;"If you were not aware"
01:42:27;01:42:32;"If you're not aware of the Tim Hortons donut and coffee chain"
01:42:32;01:42:36;"And you just saw that, you think it's someone's name"
01:42:36;01:42:38;"So they just think it's not even a font"
01:42:38;01:42:41;"They're saying, oh, this is Tim Hortons' jacket"
01:42:41;01:42:43;"And they're like, oh, Tim"
01:42:43;01:42:45;"And if you look at the cover"
01:42:45;01:42:46;"It's not a collage, but you know"
01:42:46;01:42:51;"It's only one element of this like sort of designed cover"
01:42:51;01:42:52;"Lots of color, you know, all this stuff"
01:42:52;01:42:54;"So I think they're like, oh, interesting"
01:42:54;01:42:56;"Someone was wearing that jacket"
01:42:56;01:42:58;"And we'll just use Tim from that guy"
01:42:58;01:42:59;"Whoever Tim Horton is"
01:42:59;01:43:02;"They don't know that they're ripping off a giant corporate look"
01:43:02;01:43:03;"Most successful coffee chain"
01:43:03;01:43:04;"Right, he didn't even"
01:43:04;01:43:06;"It's like the punk rocker didn't even stitch off the Horton"
01:43:06;01:43:07;"I could totally see that"
01:43:07;01:43:10;"Bob Stinson buys a Tim Horton jacket"
01:43:10;01:43:12;"And he just thinks he's like, hey guys"
01:43:12;01:43:15;"I found some like dude who worked at a factory named Tim Hortons' jacket"
01:43:15;01:43:18;"And not only they're so ignorant of the coffee chain"
01:43:18;01:43:21;"That they're just like, Tim Horton"
01:43:21;01:43:25;"Probably was like, you know, on the line at the Ford factory"
01:43:25;01:43:29;"Tim Horton, like who the hell is that?"
01:43:29;01:43:32;"And nobody's going to be like, I think he played hockey in the 60s"
01:43:32;01:43:33;"No, nobody knew about it"
01:43:33;01:43:34;"So that makes a lot of sense"
01:43:34;01:43:36;"Because totally every kid growing up"
01:43:36;01:43:38;"You or someone you knew at some point"
01:43:38;01:43:41;"Had like a thrift store jacket"
01:43:41;01:43:43;"That had some random person's name on it"
01:43:43;01:43:45;"From a different era"
01:43:45;01:43:48;"Or a gas station like jacket that said just like John"
01:43:48;01:43:49;"You know, on it"
01:43:49;01:43:50;"Bobby J"
01:43:50;01:43:53;"What's up, Bobby J?"
01:43:53;01:43:55;"You know, like, where'd you get that?"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"I wonder who that used to belong to"
01:43:57;01:43:58;"Yeah, it's totally possible"
01:43:58;01:43:59;"So when they tell the story"
01:43:59;01:44:02;"And say, you know, Bob had this jacket that said Tim on it"
01:44:02;01:44:03;"They're forgetting"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"No, it said Tim Horton"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"Yes, I understand"
01:44:06;01:44:08;"Yes, it's our chaos"
01:44:08;01:44:09;"And this may drive us crazy"
01:44:09;01:44:10;"And we won't ever get an answer"
01:44:10;01:44:13;"But I would say this is a very, this is beyond plausible"
01:44:13;01:44:14;"I feel like this is"
01:44:14;01:44:16;"I think the only breakdown in our logic"
01:44:16;01:44:20;"Is that it also necessitates the guys sending a pic"
01:44:20;01:44:23;"That like having a, there has to be like a picture of the jacket"
01:44:23;01:44:25;"That somehow made it to New York"
01:44:25;01:44:28;"Where seemingly the design was going down"
01:44:28;01:44:32;"Mr. Westerberg, we've received an unusual interview request"
01:44:32;01:44:36;"Oh, and also like they famously were such like"
01:44:36;01:44:37;"The guy from Vampire Week"
01:44:37;01:44:39;"They famously were such hard partiers"
01:44:39;01:44:41;"Yeah"
01:44:41;01:44:42;"It's like"
01:44:42;01:44:43;"You know what this reminds me of though"
01:44:43;01:44:46;"Speaking of like trying to get to the bottom of a font mystery"
01:44:46;01:44:49;"Is the whole Joker Man font thing"
01:44:49;01:44:50;"Right"
01:44:50;01:44:53;"So, you know, we got that guy in the horn"
01:44:53;01:44:54;"And we learned a lot"
01:44:54;01:44:55;"We sure did"
01:44:55;01:44:57;"Maybe this is something that, maybe this might be a"
01:44:57;01:45:00;"This one we, yeah, but I don't know if we're going to be able to crack it"
01:45:00;01:45:03;"Matt's brought something to my attention that is worth pointing out"
01:45:03;01:45:04;"Yeah"
01:45:04;01:45:08;"Again, I want to believe sort of in the best intention"
01:45:08;01:45:09;"Yeah"
01:45:09;01:45:13;"But the replacements, ""Pleased to meet me"" album cover"
01:45:13;01:45:14;"Mm-hmm"
01:45:14;01:45:15;"Is literally"
01:45:15;01:45:16;"The same font"
01:45:16;01:45:20;"A rip off of Elvis's GI Blues album cover"
01:45:20;01:45:23;"In a way that is not accidental"
01:45:23;01:45:26;"Oh, yeah, see, I thought that's why they"
01:45:26;01:45:27;"Okay, that's why it looked familiar"
01:45:27;01:45:28;"So I'm just saying"
01:45:28;01:45:29;"Right"
01:45:29;01:45:32;"Here's a band who is borrowing"
01:45:32;01:45:33;"Let it be"
01:45:33;01:45:34;"It's just"
01:45:34;01:45:35;"""Pleased to meet me"""
01:45:35;01:45:38;"They're pulling from real life stuff"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"And Tim is the album in between those albums"
01:45:40;01:45:41;"Yep"
01:45:41;01:45:43;"Like I said, it's an emotional truth, dude"
01:45:43;01:45:46;"[Laughter]"
01:45:46;01:45:47;"I mean, if I could boil it down"
01:45:47;01:45:48;"There's some connection"
01:45:48;01:45:49;"There's some"
01:45:49;01:45:50;"We're pulling the thread"
01:45:50;01:45:51;"Yeah"
01:45:51;01:45:52;"There is some connection"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"I just feel it in my bones"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"And you know what the biggest bummer is?"
01:45:56;01:45:58;"Which would be a huge part of the book"
01:45:58;01:46:00;"Bob Stinson is dead, man"
01:46:00;01:46:03;"He tragically died in '95"
01:46:03;01:46:06;"So the man who had the jacket"
01:46:06;01:46:08;"And I think he had a hard life"
01:46:08;01:46:11;"He definitely had big substance abuse issues"
01:46:11;01:46:15;"But I think he was kind of kicked out of the replacements"
01:46:15;01:46:16;"He's not on the last couple albums"
01:46:16;01:46:17;"Yeah"
01:46:17;01:46:18;"And from what I've read"
01:46:18;01:46:21;"He was real depressed and aimless after that"
01:46:21;01:46:23;"And drinking way too hard"
01:46:23;01:46:25;"Wait, are you saying they replaced him?"
01:46:25;01:46:26;"They did"
01:46:26;01:46:27;"He got replaced in the replacements"
01:46:27;01:46:28;"Damn"
01:46:28;01:46:29;"Yeah, you're like"
01:46:29;01:46:31;"You think you're in a band with a bunch of lovable losers"
01:46:31;01:46:33;"We're the replacements"
01:46:33;01:46:34;"No, no, no"
01:46:34;01:46:35;"Even you're getting replaced"
01:46:35;01:46:37;"You knew what you signed up for"
01:46:37;01:46:39;"You knew what was gonna happen"
01:46:39;01:46:42;"Yeah, and plus his little brother was in the band"
01:46:42;01:46:43;"Yeah"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"Even the blood connection wasn't there"
01:46:45;01:46:46;"But anyway, it's like"
01:46:46;01:46:47;"I feel like that's the final"
01:46:47;01:46:50;"You can picture this book or this podcast"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"The final chapter is like"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"We've talked to Paul Westerberg"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"We've talked to Robert Longo"
01:46:56;01:46:58;"We've talked to whatever"
01:46:58;01:47:01;"And it's like at the heart of this story"
01:47:01;01:47:05;"That's about four men trying to get to the bottom of a font"
01:47:05;01:47:07;"And corporate food mystery"
01:47:07;01:47:09;"Is the ultimate tragedy"
01:47:09;01:47:13;"Which is that this dude Bob Stinson had a hard life and died"
01:47:13;01:47:15;"Like way too young"
01:47:15;01:47:16;"That's that realness"
01:47:16;01:47:18;"That's the reason we'll never know"
01:47:18;01:47:20;"Unless somebody has his stuff"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"Maybe his brother Tommy"
01:47:22;01:47:23;"Maybe Tommy"
01:47:23;01:47:25;"What's up with Tommy Stinson these days?"
01:47:25;01:47:27;"He was just on Mark Hopp's show"
01:47:27;01:47:28;"I think"
01:47:28;01:47:32;"Wasn't he playing like in Guns and Roses?"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"Oh yeah, he was in Guns and Roses"
01:47:34;01:47:36;"Wait, this would be too crazy"
01:47:36;01:47:40;"There was also like a pretty conservative book about the replacements from a few years ago"
01:47:40;01:47:41;"We gotta read that"
01:47:41;01:47:42;"That author"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"I don't wanna be too dark about this"
01:47:44;01:47:46;"But imagine if we get in touch with Tommy Stinson"
01:47:46;01:47:47;"We're just like"
01:47:47;01:47:50;"You know, where's your brother's stuff go when he died?"
01:47:50;01:47:51;"And he's like, oh man"
01:47:51;01:47:54;"Yeah, that's in like a storage facility"
01:47:54;01:47:55;"Outside of Minneapolis"
01:47:55;01:47:57;"Nobody's looked at it for decades"
01:47:57;01:48:00;"And we're just like, book the first ticket out there"
01:48:00;01:48:03;"I actually thought you were gonna say"
01:48:03;01:48:04;"I thought you were gonna say what I said"
01:48:04;01:48:07;"Which is that he was buried in the Tim Hortons jacket"
01:48:07;01:48:08;"Oh God"
01:48:08;01:48:12;"Do you see Field Trip?"
01:48:12;01:48:13;"I'm just saying"
01:48:13;01:48:16;"Just, you know, maybe just the narrative"
01:48:16;01:48:18;"I'm just saying, say like a poetic license for whatever the movie is"
01:48:18;01:48:22;"After the book, is it like chaos is adapted into the movie"
01:48:22;01:48:23;"Oh no, I got it"
01:48:23;01:48:24;"No, I feel you"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"It's like, no, this is it"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"We go to Minneapolis"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"We're like chasing down leads"
01:48:30;01:48:33;"At some point, there's also some shadowy figures"
01:48:33;01:48:35;"Who are like, these guys are getting too close"
01:48:35;01:48:36;"They like beat the shit out of us"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"Outside of First Ave"
01:48:38;01:48:42;"And then we finally break into the storage facility"
01:48:42;01:48:43;"And there's like all these twists and turns"
01:48:43;01:48:44;"We're going through all his old clothes"
01:48:44;01:48:46;"But we still can't find it"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"And then at the end, we finally give up"
01:48:48;01:48:52;"And we go to visit his grave to lay flowers"
01:48:53;01:48:55;"And we like pour some out for him"
01:48:55;01:48:57;"We're like, you were an awesome guitarist"
01:48:57;01:49:00;"Respect, eternally, rest in peace"
01:49:00;01:49:01;"And then as we walk away"
01:49:01;01:49:04;"In a cool shot, the camera goes down into the earth"
01:49:04;01:49:08;"All the way down into the coffin"
01:49:08;01:49:09;"And then you see the jacket"
01:49:09;01:49:11;"That's a pretty good ending"
01:49:11;01:49:14;"It's a great ending"
01:49:14;01:49:16;"It's a great ending"
01:49:16;01:49:19;"I don't know what happens the two hours before that"
01:49:19;01:49:20;"Well, no, you said it"
01:49:20;01:49:22;"There's like so much, even just like"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"Getting to Minneapolis, the bolt cutters, learning"
01:49:24;01:49:28;"I think, I mean, it's not the most interesting movie"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"But I think that there's some meat on the bones"
01:49:30;01:49:31;"It's kind of like a kooky"
01:49:31;01:49:34;"Like Alex Jones conspiracy theory dude"
01:49:34;01:49:35;"But he's more of like"
01:49:35;01:49:37;"He focuses on alternative rock from the 80s"
01:49:37;01:49:40;"And somehow he teams up with a really straight-laced"
01:49:40;01:49:43;"Corporate detective from Tim Hortons"
01:49:43;01:49:47;"Like a real slick guy from a Montreal-based law firm or something"
01:49:47;01:49:49;"And it's like a bit of an odd couple thing"
01:49:49;01:49:51;"And they go to Minneapolis together and blah, blah, blah"
01:49:51;01:49:52;"And then, and then"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"What if, okay, we're all talking about this"
01:49:54;01:49:55;"Here's the movie, we're joking"
01:49:55;01:49:57;"It's all funny, we're making this joke"
01:49:57;01:50:00;"And we get approached sort of like noir style"
01:50:00;01:50:02;"And there's this, you know, sort of"
01:50:02;01:50:05;"An attractive kind of femme fatale kind of woman walks in"
01:50:05;01:50:09;"And she is somehow like the daughter of"
01:50:09;01:50:12;"Whoever created the font for Tim Hortons"
01:50:12;01:50:14;"And she's just like, not destitute"
01:50:14;01:50:17;"But she, there's a lot of money that they could"
01:50:17;01:50:19;"You know, the replacements stole this font"
01:50:19;01:50:21;"And I really do need you to prove"
01:50:21;01:50:22;"You know what I mean?"
01:50:22;01:50:25;"Well gentlemen, I've fallen on hard times"
01:50:25;01:50:27;"And I've heard about this great sounding"
01:50:27;01:50:30;"New replacements remastered version"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"That's big money fellas"
01:50:32;01:50:34;"That's you re-mastered man"
01:50:34;01:50:39;"I heard they made the drum sound less 80s"
01:50:39;01:50:41;"That's gonna be selling a lot of copies"
01:50:41;01:50:43;"And I want a taste"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"I want to get out of this town"
01:50:45;01:50:48;"I want some of that Tim remix money"
01:50:48;01:50:53;"And that starts us on the show"
01:50:53;01:50:55;"It's a bit Chinatown, you know what I mean?"
01:50:55;01:50:56;"Yeah"
01:50:56;01:50:57;"I think this is great"
01:50:57;01:50:59;"Chinatown"
01:50:59;01:51:01;"An emotional truth man"
01:51:01;01:51:03;"Alright, I don't know if we should do the top five today"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"I think, I'm glad we went deep on that"
01:51:05;01:51:07;"By the way, I don't, yeah I think we're over"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"But I love that we were gonna start with it"
01:51:09;01:51:10;"And we're just not gonna do it"
01:51:10;01:51:11;"Why don't we listen to a couple more"
01:51:11;01:51:13;"Replaced songs off Tim"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"Let's listen to two and a half songs off Tim"
01:51:15;01:51:17;"And instead of doing a top five"
01:51:17;01:51:19;"We'll do a top two and a half off Tim"
01:51:19;01:51:21;"We already listened to a bit of Bastards of Young"
01:51:21;01:51:23;"We listened to a bit of Swingin' Party"
01:51:23;01:51:25;"Those are probably like the two like"
01:51:25;01:51:27;"Songs that everybody loves"
01:51:27;01:51:29;"There's that song Waitress in the Sky"
01:51:29;01:51:30;"I was just thinking of that"
01:51:30;01:51:33;"Always reminds me of that song Mountain of Love"
01:51:33;01:51:34;"Do you know that song?"
01:51:34;01:51:36;"No, what's Mountain of Love?"
01:51:36;01:51:39;"It's a, Johnny Rivers popularized it"
01:51:39;01:51:42;"Okay, let's do an A/B on Waitress in the Sky"
01:51:42;01:51:43;"And Mountain of Love"
01:51:43;01:51:44;"It's the same song"
01:51:44;01:51:45;"It drives me kind of crazy"
01:51:45;01:51:47;"Waitress in the Sky is just such a"
01:51:47;01:51:49;"Also, I guess that's pure replacements"
01:51:49;01:51:53;"It's like this, like so raw emotional song"
01:51:53;01:51:55;"Like Bastards of Young"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"And then a song just kind of like"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"Dissing flight attendants"
01:51:59;01:52:03;"You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky"
01:52:07;01:52:20;"She don't wear no pants"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"She don't wear no tie"
01:52:22;01:52:24;"Always on the ball"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"She's always on strike"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"Big deal you get the fly"
01:52:30;01:52:33;"You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky"
01:52:33;01:52:37;"You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky"
01:52:37;01:52:40;"Take it easy, Paul"
01:52:40;01:52:41;"Yeah, kind of mean"
01:52:41;01:52:45;"Pay my fare"
01:52:45;01:52:48;"Don't wanna complain"
01:52:48;01:52:49;"You get to me"
01:52:49;01:52:51;"You're always out of champagne"
01:52:51;01:52:53;"Treat me like a bum"
01:52:53;01:52:55;"Don't wear no tie"
01:52:55;01:52:58;"'Cause you ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky"
01:52:58;01:53:02;"You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky"
01:53:02;01:53:07;"And the sign says thank you"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"I think he felt dissed by a flight attendant"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"I guess maybe in the 80s"
01:53:11;01:53:14;"'Cause he was still drunk and he smelled of booze"
01:53:14;01:53:16;"And he was like scruffy"
01:53:16;01:53:19;"And he's like, I'm on a plane, I want some champagne"
01:53:19;01:53:21;"And she's like, no sir"
01:53:21;01:53:24;"You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky"
01:53:24;01:53:27;"Garbage man, a janitor, and you, my dear"
01:53:27;01:53:31;"A reunion flight attendant, my oh my"
01:53:31;01:53:34;"You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky"
01:53:34;01:53:38;"You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky"
01:53:38;01:53:41;"You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky"
01:53:44;01:54:00;"Here's what Paul Westerberg had to say about the song"
01:54:00;01:54:04;"Waitress in the sky has been misconstrued since day one"
01:54:04;01:54:08;"It came from my sister who was a flight attendant"
01:54:08;01:54:11;"And she used the phrase in disgust"
01:54:11;01:54:14;"Explaining that she was treated like a waitress in the sky"
01:54:14;01:54:17;"Although even that's a bit demeaning"
01:54:17;01:54:21;"Like, you're like a flight attendant, you're just like talking to your brothers"
01:54:21;01:54:22;"Like, that must be a cool job"
01:54:22;01:54:24;"No, I get these terrible"
01:54:24;01:54:27;"Sometimes you get these terrible people on the plane"
01:54:27;01:54:29;"They treat me like I'm a waitress"
01:54:29;01:54:32;"Like, I'm definitely not a waitress"
01:54:32;01:54:36;"Anyway, Paul said, so I took the role of the demanding bastard in the aeroplane"
01:54:36;01:54:39;"And expects the flight attendant to be a nurse and a maid"
01:54:39;01:54:42;"Some took it as a slam, but it was me trying to speak through her experience"
01:54:42;01:54:44;"Nobody ever threw a drink on me over it"
01:54:44;01:54:50;"Okay, that's that working class solidarity that, you know, Paul expresses through"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"Such classics as Bastards of Young"
01:54:52;01:54:57;"Don't assume that the narrator of Waitress in the Sky is Paul Westerberg"
01:54:57;01:54:58;"He's doing a character"
01:54:58;01:55:00;"He's doing some character work"
01:55:00;01:55:02;"Wait, Matt, just throw in the Johnny Rivers real fast"
01:55:02;01:55:03;"You don't have to listen to the whole thing"
01:55:03;01:55:06;"It's just like the same exact same melody"
01:55:06;01:55:10;"This is Johnny Rivers with Flight Attendant on the Ground"
01:55:10;01:55:13;"Standing on a mountain looking down on a city"
01:55:13;01:55:17;"The way I feel is a doggone pity"
01:55:17;01:55:21;"Teardrops falling down a mountainside"
01:55:21;01:55:22;"Many times I've been hit in the face"
01:55:22;01:55:23;"You don't know this song?"
01:55:23;01:55:24;"Kind of familiar"
01:55:24;01:55:27;"Johnny Rivers also did Secret Agent Man, right?"
01:55:27;01:55:31;"You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky"
01:55:31;01:55:35;"Night after night I've been standing here alone"
01:55:35;01:55:41;"Okay, so actually, the Book of Other Replacements credits this song as being like the kind of inspiration"
01:55:41;01:55:43;"And also Hot Love by T-Rex"
01:55:43;01:55:46;"Just by chance that I get a glimpse of you"
01:55:46;01:55:48;"Tryin' hard to find you"
01:55:48;01:55:51;"More than the rhythm of the song comes from Mountain of Love"
01:55:51;01:55:52;"Right"
01:55:52;01:55:55;"A mountain of love"
01:55:55;01:55:57;"Waitress in the sky"
01:55:57;01:56:00;"You must be a waitress in the sky"
01:56:00;01:56:04;"We used to be a mountain of love"
01:56:04;01:56:07;"But you just changed your name"
01:56:07;01:56:09;"What should we listen to next?"
01:56:09;01:56:12;"I mean, Left of the Dial is pretty classic"
01:56:12;01:56:14;"What else do you like?"
01:56:14;01:56:16;"I like Here Comes a Regular"
01:56:16;01:56:18;"Let's listen to Here Comes a Regular"
01:56:18;01:56:22;"This is a good way to close"
01:56:22;01:56:24;"Alright, yeah"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"Yeah, we did two and a half songs"
01:56:26;01:56:28;"Johnny Rivers was the half"
01:56:28;01:56:38;"Well, a person can work up a mean, mean thirst"
01:56:38;01:56:44;"After a hard day of nothing much at all"
01:56:44;01:56:46;"Amazing opening lines"
01:56:46;01:56:47;"Yeah"
01:56:47;01:56:49;"The sun has passed, it's too late"
01:56:49;01:56:52;"They cut the grass"
01:56:52;01:56:59;"There ain't much to make anyway in the fall"
01:56:59;01:57:07;"And sometimes I just stay in the mood"
01:57:07;01:57:12;"Take my place in the back of the loud noise"
01:57:12;01:57:14;"Help, please, help, please"
01:57:14;01:57:15;"Help, please, help"
01:57:15;01:57:17;"And I've a picture on the fridge"
01:57:17;01:57:21;"It's never stocked with food"
01:57:21;01:57:23;"Yeah, it reminds me of, like, yeah, like"
01:57:23;01:57:28;"Russ Never Sleeps era, Neil kind of"
01:57:28;01:57:36;"Everybody wants to be special here"
01:57:36;01:57:41;"They call your name out loud and clear"
01:57:41;01:57:48;"Here comes a regular"
01:57:48;01:57:55;"Call out your name"
01:57:55;01:57:58;"Here comes a regular"
01:57:58;01:58:00;"Wait, what year did Cheers start?"
01:58:00;01:58:02;"Probably like a year or two before this?"
01:58:02;01:58:04;"I'm gonna guess like '83 or..."
01:58:04;01:58:07;"September '82"
01:58:07;01:58:11;"I wonder if he was, like, watching Cheers and listening to the Cheers theme song"
01:58:11;01:58:14;"and, like, got him thinking about, like,"
01:58:14;01:58:19;"I'm gonna write ""I Wanna Go"" where everybody knows your name"
01:58:19;01:58:23;"I'm gonna write... he's gonna write the more realist, sad version"
01:58:23;01:58:24;"Yeah, exactly"
01:58:24;01:58:29;"I just love that opening line, too, of, like, yeah, you think about, like, a Bruce Springsteen or Bob Seger song"
01:58:29;01:58:33;"It's like the guy's, like, having some drinks after, like, a hard day at work"
01:58:33;01:58:34;"Yeah, and the ball western..."
01:58:34;01:58:36;"Actually, pause it for a second"
01:58:36;01:58:37;"I want to talk about the lyrics"
01:58:37;01:58:38;"Yeah"
01:58:38;01:58:41;"'Cause it is interesting 'cause it is so specific"
01:58:41;01:58:45;"Like, I'm not suggesting it's, like, a Cheers ripoff 'cause it is so different"
01:58:45;01:58:47;"It is the realist version"
01:58:47;01:58:48;"Yeah"
01:58:48;01:58:53;"Where it's not just... it's not that just kind of like, hey, you know, life can get you down"
01:58:53;01:58:55;"and don't you want to go to a place where everybody knows your name?"
01:58:55;01:58:57;"This is so much more desperate"
01:58:57;01:59:01;"I kind of wonder, like, the picture he's painting of, like, the person in the song"
01:59:01;01:59:05;"Person can work up a mean, mean thirst after a hard day of nothing much at all"
01:59:05;01:59:07;"Summer's past, it's too late to cut the grass"
01:59:07;01:59:09;"There ain't much to rake anyway in the fall"
01:59:09;01:59:14;"And then it says later, and sometimes I just ain't in the mood to take my place in back with a loud mouth"
01:59:14;01:59:17;"You're like a picture on the fridge that's never stocked with food"
01:59:17;01:59:20;"I used to live at home, now I stay at the house"
01:59:20;01:59:22;"What do you think that means?"
01:59:22;01:59:23;"Is he, like..."
01:59:23;01:59:30;"Is he, like, a dude who's, like, maybe some of his buddies went to college but he's still, like..."
01:59:30;01:59:35;"Is he saying, like, when I was a kid I lived at home with my parents"
01:59:35;01:59:37;"and now I'm just, like, this weird dude"
01:59:37;01:59:40;"I'm not a kid anymore and I'm not, like, a guy with my a** together"
01:59:40;01:59:42;"so I still actually live at home"
01:59:42;01:59:46;"but now I feel like just a random dude who stays at the house"
01:59:46;01:59:47;"You know what I mean?"
01:59:47;01:59:49;"Yeah, yeah, the difference between a home and a house, right?"
01:59:49;01:59:52;"And I also kind of picture him maybe being, like..."
01:59:52;01:59:56;"Even he's talking about it's too late to cut the grass and there ain't much to rake anyway in the fall"
01:59:56;02:00:01;"I'm picturing, like, maybe a dude in his, like, mid to late 20s"
02:00:01;02:00:05;"Like, some of his friends have jobs, a couple have families"
02:00:05;02:00:08;"He's been, like, living at home, kind of partying"
02:00:08;02:00:12;"But it's, like, just reaching that point where it's starting to be, like, I've been here too long"
02:00:12;02:00:16;"And, like, his dad's, like, ""Well, if you're gonna stay here, at least, like, mow the lawn"""
02:00:16;02:00:20;"And he's just, like, ""Oh, man, it's, you know, it's, like, late September, I don't know"""
02:00:20;02:00:23;"And he's, like, ""Well, rake or just f***ing do something"""
02:00:23;02:00:26;"He's just, like, ""I'm gonna go to the f***ing bar"""
02:00:26;02:00:27;"Just, like, leaves"
02:00:27;02:00:28;"Just, like, rake"
02:00:28;02:00:32;"I also picture, literally, like, it's a suburban house"
02:00:32;02:00:34;"But, like, it's just totally exposed"
02:00:34;02:00:36;"It's one of those streets that has no trees on it"
02:00:36;02:00:40;"So there's just, like, there's not much to rake"
02:00:40;02:00:45;"It's just totally, like, this sun-bleached, kind of suburbia"
02:00:45;02:00:47;"Nothing to rake anyway"
02:00:47;02:00:51;"Alright, well, let's play out the rest of Here Comes the Regular"
02:00:51;02:00:54;"Shout out to The Replacements and Tim Hortons"
