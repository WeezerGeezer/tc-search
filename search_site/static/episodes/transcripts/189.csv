00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:02;00:04;"The hiatus is over."
00:04;00:09;"The boys are back in town, and we got quite a bit to talk about."
00:09;00:17;"Popchips, the cardigans, Mike and the Mechanics, and so much more."
00:17;00:25;"This is the first Time Crisis of 2023, so buckle up and"
00:25;00:27;"grab a beverage"
00:28;00:32;"for Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:32;00:34;"Let's begin."
00:44;00:50;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:50;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go."
01:05;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:15;01:20;"Leave it only there."
01:20;01:22;"Time Crisis back again."
01:22;01:23;"Feeling good."
01:23;01:26;"Feeling good, back in the studio, everybody's here."
01:26;01:28;"It's been a while."
01:28;01:29;"I'm gonna refrain."
01:29;01:35;"After Jake's two months suspension for saying that BTS sucked,"
01:35;01:38;"I'm trying to think, what would Jake get suspended for?"
01:38;01:43;"Suspended by the Apple Corporation or by the Time Crisis corporate board?"
01:43;01:44;"By the FCC."
01:44;01:45;"Oh, okay."
01:45;01:48;"The government which regulates communications."
01:48;01:54;"Jake said, quote unquote, ""Not feeling this new BTS track. They suck."""
01:54;01:56;"Are we talking built to spill or are we talking BTS?"
01:56;01:57;"What are we talking?"
01:57;02:00;"They weren't sure. They couldn't risk it."
02:00;02:02;"So two months off the air."
02:02;02:03;"How's everybody doing?"
02:03;02:05;"How are you doing, Seinfeld?"
02:05;02:06;"Yeah, I'm good. What's up?"
02:06;02:08;"What's new?"
02:08;02:09;"Not much."
02:09;02:10;"I missed you guys."
02:10;02:12;"Yeah, I missed you too."
02:12;02:14;"What's going on in the online Seinfeld community?"
02:14;02:17;"Oh, I put out a tweet today."
02:17;02:22;"I did one of those, like, one's gotta go, like, which one are you eliminating from Seinfeld?"
02:22;02:25;"You know what I mean? I put the picture of each cast member."
02:25;02:26;"The consensus is Jerry."
02:26;02:27;"Really?"
02:27;02:29;"Yeah, people don't want him."
02:29;02:31;"I mean, if they had to eliminate one."
02:31;02:32;"He's suffering from success."
02:32;02:35;"I mean, he is kind of like the least interesting character."
02:35;02:37;"But then a lot of people are like, you need a straight man."
02:37;02:38;"Like, you need the one. He's the glue."
02:38;02:41;"He's the apartment. Without him, there's no Kramer."
02:41;02:43;"Oh, yeah, absolutely."
02:43;02:46;"Somebody was like, without Jerry's food, Kramer dies."
02:46;02:47;"That's right."
02:47;02:48;"Straight up."
02:48;02:49;"I got a real question for you."
02:49;02:51;"Real question? That was real?"
02:51;02:53;"[laughs]"
02:53;02:56;"Do you think, is Seinfeld getting more popular?"
02:56;02:58;"Because when I heard that Netflix was going to buy it,"
02:58;03:01;"there was a small part of me that felt like,"
03:01;03:06;"we all love Seinfeld, but is it too weird for Gen Z to get into?"
03:06;03:07;"You know?"
03:07;03:08;"Here's what I'll say."
03:08;03:14;"I've noticed a lot of more international quote tweets on the timeline"
03:14;03:16;"since the Netflix acquisition."
03:16;03:19;"So I'll see a lot of South American tweets."
03:19;03:22;"I'll see a lot of stuff in foreign languages."
03:22;03:24;"I see a lot of Arabic tweets."
03:24;03:27;"So I'm thinking that might be the Netflix global effect."
03:27;03:31;"But I think, to your point, there's also a bit of like,"
03:31;03:35;"Gen Z, this show is actually super problematic in all these different ways."
03:35;03:36;"So I don't know."
03:36;03:39;"Anecdotally, I could see some international--"
03:39;03:41;"I feel like maybe it's growing a bit."
03:41;03:43;"It's weird when you think of the timing."
03:43;03:45;"I think about when I was a kid,"
03:45;03:49;"it would be like being into I Love Lucy or something, in a way,"
03:49;03:50;"based on the timeline."
03:50;03:54;"So it's kind of, you know, it seems like it still has this timeless appeal."
03:54;03:55;"Anyway."
03:55;03:56;"It's an old weird show."
03:56;03:58;"Anyway, Seinfeld, check it out."
03:58;03:59;"It's streaming on Netflix."
04:11;04:12;"What's up with you, Nick?"
04:12;04:13;"You still watch Seinfeld?"
04:13;04:15;"Not joking, every night."
04:15;04:16;"Really?"
04:16;04:17;"Every single night."
04:17;04:22;"When we go to bed, throw on Netflix, one, two episodes."
04:22;04:25;"Max watches it, we all watch one episode, and that sort of gets us."
04:25;04:27;"Right, that's your son."
04:27;04:27;"Yeah."
04:27;04:28;"And how old is he?"
04:28;04:29;"Eleven."
04:29;04:31;"And he gets it?"
04:31;04:32;"Oh, yeah."
04:32;04:33;"I mean, we've watched it for a long time."
04:33;04:34;"Right."
04:34;04:35;"I mean, we got a new dog."
04:35;04:36;"He got to name it."
04:36;04:37;"Dog watches it."
04:38;04:41;"Dog's named Jerry, after Jerry Seinfeld."
04:41;04:42;"Not Garcia."
04:43;04:44;"No."
04:44;04:47;"I mean, it sort of cuts both ways, but no, he named it."
04:47;04:48;"Let's be honest."
04:48;04:49;"Let's be honest, not Seinfeld."
04:49;04:50;"Yeah."
04:51;04:52;"Okay."
04:52;04:54;"But no, we watch it every night, and it's, yeah."
04:55;05:01;"And it holds up in a way where we've seen every episode thousands of times, and you"
05:01;05:05;"will sort of dip into seasons and go, ""I've seen this one too many times."""
05:05;05:10;"What I can say, I don't know, and I had this conversation maybe yesterday, is I don't"
05:10;05:16;"know if television has just gotten so much worse or if Seinfeld's just aged very well,"
05:16;05:20;"but at the time, if you remember, people really did not like the last season."
05:20;05:22;"They thought that it had jumped the shark."
05:22;05:24;"They thought the ending was awful."
05:24;05:27;"You know where they all go to, no spoiler alerts, but where they all go to jail at the"
05:27;05:28;"end."
05:28;05:29;"Yeah, yeah."
05:29;05:30;"It is so good."
05:30;05:34;"I would totally ride for the last season of Seinfeld in a way where everybody hates it,"
05:34;05:38;"but I think in the context of the culture now, you go, ""Damn, that was good."""
05:38;05:40;"There's some really classic episodes."
05:40;05:45;"Yeah, but people, I will say, Seinfeld probably knows much more than I do, but I don't know."
05:45;05:50;"The community in general does not seem to really get behind the last season."
05:50;05:56;"They say, ""Larry David left,"" but something about it, it really just hits on all cylinders"
05:56;06:02;"still and maybe just culture's gotten so insane that that season doesn't feel insane anymore,"
06:02;06:04;"but I'll watch it every night."
06:04;06:05;"I think you're both right."
06:05;06:09;"I think there are a lot of classic episodes, and I think it also went into some very surreal"
06:09;06:12;"territory that the show was very grounded before."
06:12;06:18;"Then you've got Kramer putting human blood in his oil tank of his car to keep it powered"
06:18;06:22;"and stuff that just has no logical application anymore."
06:22;06:23;"Yeah, I don't know."
06:23;06:25;"There's a range of perspectives."
06:25;06:28;"I think it holds up, and I think it did get better over time."
06:28;06:32;"I also wanted to say I was in Baltimore last week, Charm City."
06:32;06:34;"I put on the TV late at night."
06:34;06:39;"Seinfeld was on television, linear, classic style, and it hit different."
06:39;06:40;"It was so nice to watch."
06:40;06:44;"I will say, you stay in a hotel room, and it just happens to be on."
06:44;06:46;"There's no better feeling."
06:46;06:47;"Right."
06:47;06:51;"The commercial breaks, you can send a text or something, and then you can go to the bathroom."
06:51;06:55;"You get a Seinfeld or an Impractical Jokers on linear TV in a hotel room."
06:55;07:01;"I mean, Impractical Jokers, that's whenever I do actually watch regular TV and you go"
07:01;07:07;"to True TV, I'm not kidding, they play 12 hours of Impractical Jokers a day, maybe 24 hours."
07:07;07:08;"True TV is the impact."
07:08;07:10;"Yeah, it's the Impractical Jokers Network."
07:10;07:14;"Do you remember when we went to the Adult Swim up front?"
07:14;07:16;"I took you to the Adult Swim up front."
07:16;07:17;"I forget who was playing."
07:17;07:23;"I don't think it was Jay-Z, but it was years ago, and the Impractical Jokers were there."
07:23;07:24;"Vega."
07:24;07:26;"You were so excited."
07:26;07:27;"I had never seen Impractical Jokers."
07:27;07:28;"I was a big fan."
07:28;07:30;"But I couldn't believe it."
07:30;07:33;"People were pretty surprised that you were like, ""Oh, wow."""
07:33;07:36;"I mean, it's a star-studded event, this Adult Swim party."
07:36;07:40;"I guess I'm kind of like an indie snob, because when I first saw Impractical Jokers, I was"
07:40;07:44;"on True TV, season one or something."
07:44;07:46;"I was like, ""This is basically public access."""
07:46;07:48;"I was like, ""This is very low production quality."""
07:48;07:50;"But I felt like, ""I love this."
07:50;07:52;"Four lifelong friends from Staten Island."
07:52;07:54;"I like their energy."
07:54;07:59;"Obviously, this is not ready for primetime, but I like four local guys doing something"
07:59;08:00;"on local TV."
08:00;08:01;"Good for them."""
08:01;08:08;"Then I go live my life, five years later, they're basically Justin Bieber."
08:08;08:09;"These guys are huge."
08:09;08:11;"They're making movies."
08:11;08:14;"They're paid tens of millions of dollars."
08:14;08:17;"They might be billionaires if you put all four of them together."
08:17;08:21;"I guess that's how sometimes people feel about music."
08:21;08:23;"You see somebody play a club, you go live your life."
08:23;08:25;"Next thing you know, they're playing arenas."
08:25;08:27;"You feel like, A, where did the time go?"
08:27;08:32;"B, you get to have that little proprietary feeling like maybe it's a bad thing."
08:32;08:34;"I want to keep them in their place."
08:34;08:38;"I want them to be living in Staten Island and just be four local guys."
08:38;08:41;"I want them to be a local secret for the tri-state area."
09:49;09:50;"Never seen it."
09:50;09:53;"Even just the name, the name is so bad."
09:53;09:56;"When you really think about it, Impractical Jokers,"
09:56;10:00;"that it really just had that low budget local flavor."
10:00;10:01;"It's a prank show?"
10:01;10:02;"Yes."
10:02;10:03;"It's for lifelong..."
10:03;10:05;"Is it like a punk?"
10:05;10:06;"You're saying the opening sequence."
10:06;10:07;"Punk? That kind of thing?"
10:07;10:09;"Well, except that they're..."
10:09;10:12;"The interesting thing is that it's for lifelong friends from Staten Island."
10:12;10:14;"These guys literally went to high school together."
10:14;10:20;"They're an improv troupe, but they're daring each other to do embarrassing things."
10:20;10:24;"So they're kind of pranking other people, but they're mostly embarrassing each other."
10:24;10:25;"Actually, there's four of us."
10:25;10:26;"Is it..."
10:26;10:27;"It's sort of..."
10:27;10:29;"I mean, like a jackass thing, but not as physical?"
10:29;10:31;"Yeah, it's very not physical."
10:31;10:36;"So a classic example, it would be that the guy's wearing a little like earbud,"
10:36;10:37;"and he's getting fed lines, and they'll say,"
10:37;10:40;"""All right, Sal, you're going to sit down in Washington Square Park."""
10:40;10:41;"And he's like..."
10:41;10:42;"And he's sitting there, and you're kind of..."
10:42;10:43;"And he's like..."
10:43;10:45;"And they're like in a truck or something."
10:45;10:46;"And he's like, ""All right, guys."""
10:46;10:48;"And they're like, ""Here's what you're going to do."
10:48;10:53;"""The next guy who walks by, you got to ask him for help."
10:53;10:56;"""And when he says, 'What's your problem?' you got to say, 'My butt hurts.'"""
10:56;10:58;"It's like something like that."
10:58;11:01;"And he's like, ""Oh, my God, this is going to be so embarrassing."""
11:01;11:04;"And they're like, ""But if you get the guy to actually sit down next to you"
11:04;11:06;"""and pat you on the back, you win a point."""
11:06;11:08;"Okay. Wow."
11:08;11:09;"Yeah."
11:09;11:12;"And anyway, this show became like an empire."
11:12;11:14;"Yeah. I mean, I think there's--"
11:14;11:16;"Literally on TruTV-- Have you ever heard of TruTV?"
11:16;11:18;"Heard of it, never seen it."
11:18;11:19;"Don't have linear cable."
11:19;11:22;"No, but there's two-- There's sort of culture--"
11:22;11:24;"Like, within the TV landscape,"
11:24;11:27;"there's two kind of things that people talk about being pretty crazy."
11:27;11:32;"And one is that TruTV is now basically a 24-hour network of impractical jokers."
11:32;11:35;"It, like, keeps the lights on for Tru-- There's almost no other shows."
11:35;11:40;"Similarly, on MTV, too, has become the Ridiculousness Network."
11:40;11:41;"Oh, yeah."
11:41;11:43;"Where all they show is this show, Ridiculous."
11:43;11:44;"Have you ever heard of that?"
11:44;11:45;"No."
11:45;11:46;"Oh, Rob Drydak?"
11:46;11:47;"It's on 24 hours a day."
11:47;11:48;"Damn, I'm out of the loop here."
11:48;11:49;"Yeah."
11:49;11:51;"Well, it's very debatable, all this stuff."
11:51;11:53;"Are you out of the loop or this channel's out of the loop?"
11:53;11:55;"It's hard to say."
11:55;11:56;"There's a lot of loops."
11:56;11:57;"There's a lot of loops, folks."
11:57;11:58;"There's a lot of loops."
11:58;12:00;"Well, so, just so you know,"
12:00;12:03;"I feel like we've talked about this gentle jesters thing for a while."
12:03;12:06;"Right, that was our concept, was to do--"
12:06;12:07;"Low stakes."
12:07;12:09;"Yeah, even as we discussed it, you might not have been aware,"
12:09;12:12;"that it was kind of based on impractical jokers, but--"
12:12;12:14;"Well, I'm familiar with the prank show format."
12:14;12:15;"Yeah."
12:15;12:19;"So I understood the whole setup of, I'm working at a coffee shop."
12:19;12:20;"Right."
12:20;12:21;"I'm playing Neil Young."
12:21;12:22;"Yeah."
12:22;12:25;"Someone walks in, they say, ""Oh, I love this record."""
12:25;12:27;"And I say, ""Yeah, I love Bob Dylan, too."""
12:27;12:28;"Or something like that."
12:28;12:29;"Right."
12:29;12:30;"What was-- There was something like that."
12:30;12:31;"I've never heard of Neil Young."
12:31;12:35;"It was actually like that, but it was the same where we're kind of putting you in a situation,"
12:35;12:40;"just like the jokers do to each other, where you're going to be really embarrassed."
12:40;12:43;"And because they know each other so well, they can sometimes really embarrass each other."
12:43;12:45;"Like, one of the guys used to be a firefighter."
12:45;12:49;"So maybe he loses all the pranks or something,"
12:49;12:54;"and then at the end he has to do some sort of humiliation ritual because he lost that day's show."
12:54;12:56;"And they're saying, ""All right, here's the thing."
12:56;13:00;"You're going to have to dress up like a ballerina and perform swan leg."""
13:00;13:01;"And you're like, ""Oh, my God."""
13:01;13:03;"And they're like, ""Get him on stage."""
13:03;13:05;"And then they open the curtains, and guess what?"
13:05;13:08;"It's all the guys from the station, all your old firefighter friends."
13:08;13:11;"He's like, ""Oh, my God!"""
13:11;13:14;"Anyway, so because they know each other well, they know what would particularly--"
13:14;13:15;"The pressure points."
13:15;13:16;"Right."
13:16;13:21;"So that's why I think you mistaking Neil Young for Bob Dylan would be perfect for gentle gestures."
13:21;13:25;"I think actually we could pitch this because you bring up Jackass."
13:25;13:27;"Someone could say, ""Now, Jackass was big."
13:27;13:29;"That's a cultural touchstone."
13:29;13:32;"But then MTV never--they didn't really know how to follow that up"
13:32;13:37;"because the next huge prank show was Impractical Jokers on True TV."
13:37;13:42;"MTV got their lunch eaten, and that's because people wanted to move towards gentleness."
13:42;13:43;"Wait, what about Punk'd?"
13:43;13:44;"Was that pre-Jackass?"
13:44;13:45;"That was concurrent."
13:45;13:46;"It was kind of around the same time."
13:46;13:49;"What I'm saying is Impractical Jokers took over,"
13:49;13:53;"and it's because people--they don't want all the violence of Jackass."
13:53;13:56;"They wanted something a little more down to earth, chilled out,"
13:56;13:58;"and we can say, ""Let's continue that."
13:58;13:59;"Let's go even further."
13:59;14:01;"Let's go more gentle than Impractical Jokers."""
14:01;14:03;"It's like slow TV, almost."
14:03;14:05;"Just sit back."
14:05;14:06;"Nobody gets hurt."
14:06;14:08;"No one gets humiliated."
14:08;14:12;"It's almost--at this point, not even practical jokes at this point."
14:12;14:14;"It's sort of minor embarrassment."
14:14;14:17;"It's gentle gestures."
14:17;14:19;"It's just no cuts."
14:19;14:25;"Just two hours of Jake at a coffee shop that's playing nothing but Neil Young,"
14:25;14:29;"continually making conversation with people, just saying,"
14:29;14:31;"""Now, I love Bob Dylan, but for the life of me,"
14:31;14:33;"I can't remember which album this is."
14:33;14:35;"Is this '70s Bob?"""
14:35;14:38;"And half the people are just like, ""I don't know."""
14:38;14:45;"How many roads must a man walk down"
14:45;14:53;"before they call him a man?"
14:53;15:00;"And how many seas must a white dove sail"
15:00;15:08;"before she sleeps in the sand?"
15:08;15:15;"And how many times must a cannonball fly"
15:15;15:23;"before they are forever banned?"
15:23;15:31;"The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind."
15:31;15:39;"The answer is blowing in the wind."
15:39;15:42;"I'm on CelebrityNetWorth.com,"
15:42;15:46;"and I'm going to be talking about the new season of ""The New Yorker."""
15:46;15:49;"I'm going to be talking about the new season of ""The New Yorker."""
18:25;18:29;"That sounds low to me. I guess we also got it like I said, true TV."
18:29;18:33;"It's possible that the first season of ""Impractical Jokers,"""
18:33;18:36;"they were paying each guy 200 bucks an episode."
18:36;18:39;"Clearly there was a tipping point where they renegotiated."
18:39;18:41;"- And the film rights too. - Yeah, they made a movie."
18:41;18:44;"- And then also these guys can tour. - They were doing a lot of touring."
18:44;18:46;"- Merch. - Yeah, merch."
18:46;18:50;"So I'm on Celeb's Age Wiki and there is a Jake Longstreth net worth."
18:50;18:52;"Okay, um..."
18:52;18:56;"We can bleep it out if it's too accurate."
18:56;19:00;"- I want to guess it. - It's up to date as of 2022."
19:00;19:04;"- Jake Longstreth net worth? - That's a wide range."
19:04;19:07;"I usually feel like they're way high."
19:07;19:09;"I'm going to say like $3 million."
19:09;19:13;"Oh yeah, you're right in the middle. You're worth $1 to $5 million."
19:13;19:16;"- $1 to $5 million. - $1 to $5 million. That's a pretty big range."
19:16;19:19;"- That's a huge range. - And then there's salary in 2022 is another category"
19:19;19:22;"and it says under review."
19:22;19:26;"- They're still chipping away. - Well, I'm self-employed."
19:26;19:29;"- So I don't draw a salary. - Which website are you on?"
19:29;19:31;"It's called Celeb's Age Wiki."
19:31;19:36;"Celeb's Age Wiki has three of their top analysts"
19:36;19:41;"working around the clock to review Jake's 2022 income."
19:41;19:45;"- Burning the midnight oil. - Yep."
19:45;19:48;"Oh, this is deep. I mean, there's a wiki component to this"
19:48;19:52;"where they're talking about all the different means of income that you might have."
19:52;19:54;"- What does it say? - I mean, it goes in."
19:54;19:57;"It said time crisis is the first bullet point on there."
19:57;20:00;"It talks about your brother."
20:00;20:04;"Oh yeah, Dave pays me out. Royalties."
20:04;20:08;"You got something in 2008 called the Pollack-Krasner Foundation Grant. Is that true?"
20:08;20:12;"Oh yeah, that was a one-time grant for $12,000."
20:12;20:15;"Well, compounded with interest. That's like what happened to him right there."
20:15;20:19;"Yeah, no. The $12,000 in '08, that made my whole year, man."
20:19;20:22;"- And you bought-- - Paints."
20:22;20:26;"So you bought about 10,000 Bitcoins back in '08."
20:26;20:28;"That's most of it."
20:28;20:34;"He was supposed to buy paint, and he bought Bitcoin."
20:34;20:40;"So that's just like some sort of computer aggregator that's just--"
20:40;20:43;"- Oh yeah, it's AI. - Why? What is that?"
20:43;20:48;"- There's a lot of ads on it. - Has anyone ever looked at that page?"
20:48;20:51;"- Are we the first? - Yeah, I can't see the back end."
20:51;20:54;"- I bet we're the first. - I mean, sometimes you come,"
20:54;21:00;"you see truly the most uninteresting, not useful YouTube video."
21:00;21:03;"And sometimes you just see like 89 views."
21:03;21:07;"And even then you're like, this should be two, max."
21:07;21:09;"And I guess sometimes it's by accident, but yeah."
21:09;21:13;"So I bet something like that probably got 125 views, you know?"
21:13;21:15;"People start snooping around."
21:15;21:17;"But yeah, all these websites are--"
21:17;21:21;"I feel like half the internet is just bots making stuff up now."
21:21;21:25;"Just taking news articles and trying to repackage it."
21:25;21:28;"Somebody was telling me recently, someone that was kind of dark about,"
21:28;21:31;"they found out that a friend of a friend had died."
21:31;21:35;"Total tragedy. And then they couldn't reach out to the--"
21:35;21:37;"They were trying to confirm it, but they didn't know who to hit up,"
21:37;21:39;"and they Googled it."
21:39;21:42;"And they said you get all these weird search results"
21:42;21:46;"that some sort of bot or AI that's probably going through death certificates"
21:46;21:48;"and creating weird websites."
21:48;21:52;"How did John Goldstein die on March 25th?"
21:52;21:56;"Can't you just picture it and then it's like, click here for more."
21:56;21:59;"And then it's just like, is your testosterone getting low?"
21:59;22:03;"Just imagine you're trying to actually find some real information about something"
22:03;22:05;"and you're like, what is this website?"
22:05;22:07;"Is it like an older person?"
22:07;22:09;"Enter your zip code."
22:09;22:13;"These single women are ready to--"
22:13;22:17;"And then you scroll to the bottom and there's zero information, actually."
22:17;22:21;"Right. All this old guy wanted to know is Jake Longstreet's net worth."
22:21;22:23;"Now he's signed up for--"
22:23;22:28;"I think the impractical jokers are sitting on more money."
22:28;22:31;"You're thinking eight figures."
22:31;22:37;"I assume these net worths are not accounting for investments, properties,"
22:37;22:39;"NFTs, that sort of thing."
22:39;22:43;"It's just based entirely on salary, income."
22:43;22:45;"There's a lot of private stuff that they can't account for."
22:45;22:49;"I make between $1 and $5 million a year in time crisis."
22:49;22:52;"Salary. That's my W-2."
22:52;22:59;"There's an Apple Music salary cap, which is $5 million for all hosts."
22:59;23:02;"So yeah, it varies, but within that range."

23:55;23:56;"I'd love to have 'em on."

23:58;24:00;"- I wonder what you'd think of it."
24:00;24:02;"It's not for everybody, but it's a very casual show."
24:02;24:03;"- But it's for most people."
24:03;24:04;"- It's for most people."
24:04;24:08;"- Yeah, I mean, I don't love, but I like those prank shows."
24:08;24:10;"- You have to like the guys."
24:10;24:11;"- Yeah, yeah, I can see that."
24:11;24:13;"- As a tri-state area guy,"
24:13;24:15;"I think you might enjoy the concept."
24:15;24:17;"Four lifelong friends, their names are,"
24:17;24:19;"well, there's Joe, who's gone,"
24:19;24:22;"and then Sal, Murr."
24:22;24:23;"- Short for Murray."
24:23;24:24;"- Does that sound appealing to you, Jake?"
24:24;24:26;"Four lifelong friends from Staten Island,"
24:26;24:27;"one of them's name is Murray,"
24:27;24:29;"and the guy's always like, ""Hey, Murr."
24:29;24:30;"""Okay, Murr."""
24:30;24:31;"- No, I'm down."
24:31;24:32;"- All right, you're sold?"
24:32;24:33;"- I'm open to it."
24:33;24:34;"- Murr, come on, Murr."
24:34;24:36;"If you like that, you'll enjoy it."
24:36;24:39;"So what else has been going on the last couple months?"
24:39;24:40;"- There was a Super Bowl."
24:40;24:42;"Thanks for coming to my Super Bowl party."
24:42;24:43;"- Yeah, it was fun."
24:43;24:44;"- Thanks for having us."
24:44;24:45;"- It was great."
24:45;24:45;"- Yeah."
24:45;24:46;"- Hell of a spread."
24:46;24:47;"- True."
24:47;24:48;"- Yeah."
24:48;24:49;"- So many wings."
24:49;24:50;"- There were a lot of wings."
24:50;24:51;"- Chips and guac."
24:51;24:53;"- A lot of subs."
24:53;24:55;"One thing that I don't love about throwing"
24:55;24:59;"an annual Super Bowl party is I miss all the commercials."
24:59;24:59;"- You're hosting."
24:59;25:00;"- I'm hosting."
25:00;25:02;"I'm looking around, you know,"
25:02;25:05;"tiny bit stressed, is everything okay?"
25:05;25:07;"Were there good commercials?"
25:07;25:09;"- Yeah, I caught the Duncan, the Ben Affleck one"
25:09;25:10;"out of the corner of my eye,"
25:10;25:12;"and I think I ran up to one of you guys,"
25:12;25:15;"and I was like, hey, Ben Affleck was a Duncan commercial."
25:15;25:16;"But it was very like,"
25:16;25:18;"the game was very secondary to the party, I felt."
25:18;25:21;"- There was also a lot of children there."
25:21;25:22;"- Oh, at the party?"
25:22;25:24;"- So it would be like, oh, there's a, yeah, at the party."
25:24;25:27;"They'd be like, oh, that's the Ben Affleck Duncan ad."
25:27;25:29;"Oh, well, my kid just crapped her pants."
25:29;25:33;"- Yeah, and the kids, they don't know who Ben Affleck is."
25:33;25:34;"They might not even know what Duncan is."
25:34;25:36;"Probably have some idea what a donut is."
25:36;25:38;"But yeah, none of these kids have seen Breaking Bad,"
25:38;25:41;"for instance, so the idea of a Breaking Bad reunion,"
25:41;25:43;"what were they selling?"
25:43;25:44;"- Doritos."
25:44;25:45;"- Was it though?"
25:45;25:47;"- No, it was a chip, Pop Chips."
25:47;25:48;"- Pop Chips, yeah."
25:48;25:50;"- Not familiar with that product."
25:50;25:52;"- Okay, what's actually, I'm glad I brought this up."
25:52;25:55;"What's the deal with Pop Chips?"
25:55;25:57;"Because I feel Pop Chips, they've been throwing--"
25:57;25:58;"- I feel they're the healthy alternative."
25:58;25:59;"- They've been throwing so much money"
25:59;26:01;"at Pop Chips for a decade."
26:01;26:05;"I've never seen anybody outside of some sort of like,"
26:05;26:07;"sponsored green room situation eating Pop Chips."
26:07;26:09;"- I think Jet Blue will have it."
26:09;26:10;"Jet Blue will give you them."
26:10;26:12;"- Okay, wait, clarification first of all."
26:12;26:13;"It was actually Pop Corners,"
26:13;26:16;"which I think is like a competitor to Pop Chips."
26:16;26:17;"Same idea."
26:17;26:18;"- Wait, Pop Chips got big enough"
26:18;26:21;"that there's a competitor spending,"
26:21;26:23;"and also to get the two leads from Breaking Bad"
26:23;26:25;"and by the Super Bowl,"
26:25;26:27;"that's a minimum $20 million investment."
26:27;26:29;"Maybe it's more like 30."
26:29;26:30;"- For sure, yeah."
26:30;26:33;"But I think Doritos owns, hang on a second."
26:33;26:36;"Doritos, what?"
26:36;26:37;"It's so weird."
26:37;26:38;"I think Doritos--"
26:38;26:39;"- Crunch those, you're a little rusty."
26:39;26:40;"I haven't crunched the numbers in a while."
26:40;26:41;"- It's been a minute."
26:41;26:43;"Oh, it is Frito-Lay product."
26:43;26:45;"- Okay, but just to explain."
26:45;26:45;"- Wait, wait."
26:45;26:47;"- Explain the commercial to me."
26:47;26:48;"- It's like the--"
26:48;26:49;"- Jesse and Walter White."
26:49;26:51;"- Jesse and Walter are in the trailer."
26:51;26:53;"- They're in the trailer cooking up meth."
26:53;26:55;"- But now they're cooking up Pop Corners."
26:55;26:56;"And it's the purity, right?"
26:56;26:58;"It's like, ""Oh, we made the perfect Pop Corner,"""
26:58;26:59;"or whatever."
26:59;27:00;"- And they're just like, ""They went corporate."""
27:00;27:02;"- Yeah, corporate."
27:02;27:05;"- Jesse, remember what I taught you."
27:05;27:07;"Mr. White, these Pop Corners are gonna be,"
27:07;27:08;"I can't even remember."
27:08;27:09;"(Jesse laughing)"
27:09;27:11;"Suck my (beep), Mr. White."
27:11;27:14;"These Pop Corners are gonna be fire."
27:14;27:15;"- This is gripping."
27:15;27:19;"- So Pop Corners, it's a triangular chip"
27:19;27:23;"shaped like a Dorito, but it's air-infused."
27:23;27:25;"- And it's a Frito-Lay product."
27:25;27:26;"And I think what I'm getting confused"
27:26;27:28;"is that there was also a Doritos commercial"
27:28;27:29;"during the Super Bowl."
27:29;27:31;"And so there were a lot of press releases"
27:31;27:34;"about Doritos, like Frito-Lay having a couple"
27:34;27:36;"of different spots in the Super Bowl."
27:36;27:38;"But I guess there's no real association"
27:38;27:40;"between the two products."
27:40;27:42;"- Where were you seeing these press releases?"
27:42;27:43;"- Well, I just looked it up again."
27:43;27:45;"So the thing is, when I looked it up at first,"
27:45;27:47;"whenever it came out, I saw a lot of Doritos talk"
27:47;27:49;"among the Pop Corners."
27:49;27:51;"And then I just looked it up again,"
27:51;27:53;"and there's like a USA Today article"
27:53;27:56;"where it's clearly a rewrite of a press release"
27:56;27:58;"where it's like, ""Doritos and Pop Corners are both,"""
27:58;28:00;"anyway, it doesn't matter."
28:00;28:02;"- Okay, but what about Pop Chips?"
28:02;28:03;"Pop Chips have been out for a while."
28:03;28:07;"I kind of remember like Katy Perry was always selling them."
28:07;28:08;"- Pop Chips is an American brand"
28:08;28:10;"of Pop Potato and Corn products."
28:10;28:14;"Marketing is similar to Potato Chips."
28:14;28:16;"They are manufactured by processing potato starch"
28:16;28:18;"at high pressure and temperature"
28:18;28:22;"in a process similar to that used for puffed rice cakes."
28:22;28:22;"- Okay, right."
28:22;28:26;"That's what gives it that puffy, airy, crunchy vibe."
28:26;28:28;"- And Pop Corners is the same thing,"
28:28;28:30;"same manufacturing process."
28:30;28:33;"- Pop Chips just seemed like such a failure to me."
28:33;28:34;"It just seemed like something"
28:34;28:36;"that they were trying to make happen."
28:36;28:40;"And clearly, they had big celebrity spokespeople."
28:40;28:42;"Did like Pharrell own 25% of it or something?"
28:42;28:44;"- God, how did that happen?"
28:44;28:45;"That's amazing."
28:45;28:47;"- But Pop Chips was just like massive,"
28:47;28:50;"using big celebrities, and just felt like,"
28:50;28:52;"I don't know anybody who's buying Pop Chips."
28:52;28:54;"- Oh, okay, investors in Pop Chips,"
28:54;28:57;"Ashton Kutcher, punked callback here."
28:57;28:57;"- There you go."
28:57;29:02;"- David Ortiz, Puff Daddy, Sean Combs, and Jillian Michaels."
29:02;29:04;"So that's probably-"
29:04;29:06;"- Wait, is Jillian Michaels our friend from Diet Coke?"
29:06;29:06;"- No."
29:06;29:07;"- And it's Gillian Jacobs."
29:07;29:08;"- Oh, my bad."
29:08;29:09;"Who's Jillian Michaels?"
29:09;29:10;"- Jillian Michaels."
29:10;29:12;"- Jillian, I think you'd recognize her if you saw her."
29:12;29:13;"She's a personal trainer."
29:13;29:14;"I think she's in reality."
29:14;29:19;"- Dude, I love that David Ortiz is an investor."
29:19;29:20;"That rules."
29:20;29:21;"- Big poppy."
29:21;29:21;"- Yeah."
29:21;29:23;"Puff Daddy and Big Poppy."
29:23;29:24;"- Ay."
29:24;29:26;"- Going in."
29:26;29:27;"- Right?"
29:27;29:29;"- So Jillian Michaels was on The Biggest Loser."
29:29;29:32;"- Okay, yeah, she's a fitness influencer."
29:32;29:32;"- Yeah."
29:32;29:33;"- So when did-"
29:33;29:34;"- I just wanna say-"
29:34;29:36;"- But when did Pop Chips drop?"
29:36;29:37;"When did that hit the scene?"
29:37;29:40;"- 2007."
29:40;29:42;"- Oh, it's been around, God, it's been around 16 years."
29:42;29:46;"- And from an article in Entrepreneur Magazine in 2019,"
29:46;29:48;"the result, ""Pop Chips became a hit snack"
29:48;29:51;"under Keith Belling's leadership"
29:51;29:53;"and has sold in more than 30,000 stores"
29:53;29:57;"and has generated more than $100 million in revenue."""
29:57;29:58;"- Huge."
29:58;30:00;"- That sounds like a fail to me."
30:00;30:01;"(laughing)"
30:01;30:02;"Sorry."
30:02;30:03;"- Why?"
30:03;30:05;"- So that's 16 years."
30:05;30:07;"- Generated $100 million?"
30:07;30:09;"I mean, don't you think-"
30:09;30:13;"- So it's like, yeah, it's like six or $7 million a year"
30:13;30:14;"in revenue."
30:14;30:15;"- It's-"
30:15;30:16;"- How much are they spent on advertising?"
30:16;30:17;"- Right."
30:17;30:18;"- Oh, yeah, well."
30:18;30:20;"- I don't know, that doesn't sound like a big win for me."
30:20;30:21;"- I mean, let's just do the, what is that?"
30:21;30:22;"- Wait, wait, wait, what did you say?"
30:22;30:24;"$6 million a year?"
30:24;30:25;"- That's off the top of the head."
30:25;30:27;"- It's an impractical joke or a year."
30:27;30:29;"To be honest, I think the fact that you've even heard of it"
30:29;30:31;"makes it successful."
30:31;30:33;"- Yeah, it's six and a quarter million a year."
30:33;30:34;"- Okay."
30:34;30:37;"- 16 years divided by 100 mil."
30:37;30:38;"- So the creator of-"
30:38;30:39;"- But that's revenue."
30:39;30:40;"- Yeah, exactly."
30:40;30:41;"They're spending more than that on ads."
30:41;30:43;"So that's a loss leader."
30:43;30:45;"- But they're not doing so much advertising."
30:45;30:45;"I feel like you don't really see it."
30:45;30:47;"- They just dropped $30 million on a-"
30:47;30:49;"- Keith, I mean, that was Pop Corners."
30:49;30:51;"- Right, but Doritos probably makes"
30:51;30:53;"like billions and billions."
30:53;30:53;"- Yeah."
30:53;30:55;"- Are we talking about Pop Chips or Pop Corners"
30:55;30:56;"at this point?"
30:56;30:57;"- Who cares?"
30:57;30:58;"- Pop Corners is new."
30:58;30:59;"Pop Corners is brand new."
30:59;31:00;"- Something's off here."
31:00;31:02;"This thing stinks to high hell."
31:02;31:04;"- Getting something into the national conversation"
31:04;31:05;"seems so hard."
31:05;31:07;"Look, here's the article."
31:07;31:08;"- But not if you're not selling anything."
31:08;31:10;"- The entrepreneur behind Pop Chips"
31:10;31:14;"hopes to have another hit with rice made from vegetables."
31:14;31:16;"Keith Belling's Right Rice, made of lentils, chickpeas,"
31:16;31:18;"and peas will be available today nationwide"
31:18;31:21;"on Amazon and Whole Foods stores."
31:21;31:21;"- I've seen that stuff."
31:21;31:22;"I've seen Right Rice."
31:22;31:23;"- You've seen this?"
31:23;31:24;"- I've never seen that before."
31:24;31:25;"- I've never seen that either."
31:25;31:26;"- Are you sure?"
31:26;31:27;"- I've seen it, yeah."
31:27;31:28;"- Have you had it?"
31:28;31:29;"- Never had one."
31:29;31:31;"What am I gonna do with that Right Rice?"
31:31;31:35;"- It reminds me of when IHOP flipped the P,"
31:35;31:36;"turned into IHOP."
31:36;31:39;"Were they selling more burgers or pancakes?"
31:39;31:39;"- Doubt it."
31:39;31:40;"- No, no."
31:40;31:41;"- You guys remember this?"
31:41;31:43;"Pop Chips received widespread criticism"
31:43;31:47;"in a 2012 ad campaign where Ashton Kutcher"
31:47;31:49;"pretended to be an Indian man looking for love"
31:49;31:51;"in a dating ad style spoof."
31:51;31:52;"Do you remember that?"
31:52;31:53;"- It was explosive."
31:53;31:56;"- And he was doing an Indian, like a Apu voice?"
31:56;31:57;"- He had dark makeup on."
31:57;32:00;"- Oh, because it was curry flavored or something?"
32:00;32:01;"- Good question."
32:01;32:06;"No, I don't think it had anything to do with flavor."
32:06;32:08;"- A white guy putting on makeup."
32:08;32:10;"- I think it was years beyond."
32:10;32:12;"It was already like--"
32:12;32:14;"- I mean, 2012 sounds very late, but."
32:14;32:17;"- Yeah, I think it was very questionable,"
32:17;32:18;"even at the time."
32:18;32:19;"- That does sound familiar."
32:19;32:20;"Okay, here's my thing."
32:20;32:23;"All due respect to Keith Bellinger,"
32:23;32:25;"the creator of Pop Chips."
32:25;32:30;"If you told me, okay, there's a guy"
32:30;32:34;"from Rancho Cucamonga in his garage,"
32:34;32:36;"whatever, he was a chemistry teacher,"
32:36;32:38;"a Walter White type chemistry teacher,"
32:38;32:41;"got laid off, sitting around at home,"
32:41;32:44;"and he had this, started experimenting in the garage,"
32:44;32:49;"and he figured out how to air infuse potato starch,"
32:49;32:50;"and it was kinda crunchy,"
32:50;32:52;"and he was selling them at the farmer's market, whatever."
32:52;32:54;"Next thing you know, it's a company"
32:54;32:56;"that does $100 million in revenue,"
32:56;32:58;"which maybe they meant per year,"
32:58;32:59;"which would be a different story."
32:59;33:00;"I would be like, that's an amazing story."
33:00;33:04;"That sounds like the Cliff guy who started Cliff Bar."
33:04;33:09;"We love the story, just somebody cooking it up"
33:09;33:10;"in the kitchen."
33:10;33:11;"- Big League Chew. - Big League Chew."
33:11;33:13;"The controversial Big League Chew."
33:13;33:15;"So if you told me that, I would say,"
33:15;33:19;"this is a great story of American ingenuity,"
33:19;33:22;"and although you have not remotely come close"
33:22;33:26;"to creating a product as iconic as Doritos,"
33:26;33:29;"Cheetos, or even Ruffles, my hat's off to you,"
33:29;33:32;"because you did something."
33:32;33:34;"You went from being an unemployed chemistry teacher"
33:34;33:38;"to a very wealthy man, but the reason I don't feel that way"
33:38;33:40;"is because my memory of Popchips"
33:40;33:41;"is that it came out of the gate"
33:41;33:44;"with the big celebrity sponsors."
33:44;33:48;"So that makes it feel like a PSYOP."
33:48;33:51;"That's a psychological operation for people who don't know."
33:51;33:53;"Because, or what would you call it?"
33:53;33:54;"You know what it really is?"
33:54;33:56;"It's not a PSYOP, it's an industry plant."
33:56;33:58;"You know?"
33:58;34:02;"- I think you're right about the PSYOP."
34:02;34:06;"In an article from, when is this article?"
34:06;34:07;"2013 about Popchips."
34:07;34:09;"This is a great line."
34:09;34:11;"Popchips started with a distinctive edge."
34:11;34:16;"Quote, ""Popping was a breakthrough,"" says Kara Nelson."
34:16;34:21;"Food trendologist from CCD Innovation."
34:21;34:25;"Food trendologist."
34:25;34:27;"I mean, this is real."
34:27;34:31;"- We're scraping the bottom of the barrel here."
34:31;34:33;"- We should get some food trendologists on."
34:33;34:35;"- Wait, when you say that,"
34:35;34:37;"are you saying what we're talking about or the show?"
34:37;34:38;"- Both."
34:38;34:42;"♪ The last leaf falling ♪"
34:42;34:45;"♪ There an earth where green ♪"
34:45;34:50;"♪ The water's bone ♪"

35:36;35:46;"- The idea that there's Doritos,"
35:46;35:50;"the Frito-Lay company wanted to make a Popchips competitor"
35:50;35:54;"and dump $30 million or more to kick it off."
35:54;35:56;"It just doesn't compute."
35:56;35:58;"Maybe it's really doing $100 million a year,"
35:58;36:01;"which I guess is pretty good."
36:01;36:03;"- I do remember the Katy Perry."
36:03;36:04;"- It didn't say that."
36:04;36:05;"- The Katy Perry placement, I mean,"
36:05;36:08;"when she was at the peak of her popularity,"
36:08;36:09;"she was like number one,"
36:09;36:10;"three number one albums back to back,"
36:10;36:11;"then she was heavy on the Popchips."
36:11;36:13;"I remember that very well."
36:13;36:15;"Going to a grocery store, cardboard cutout,"
36:15;36:18;"Katy Perry, TV commercials, social media."
36:18;36:20;"I remember even at the time, it felt like this is a lot."
36:20;36:21;"- The only other thing that I could think of"
36:21;36:24;"is that they launched in this era"
36:24;36:26;"when you were starting to have"
36:26;36:29;"the multi-hyphenate entertainer business person."
36:29;36:33;"I don't know if anybody saw the new Shaq documentary."
36:33;36:36;"It's a four-part series on HBO Max."
36:36;36:36;"I enjoyed it."
36:36;36:38;"I'm a lifelong Shaq fan."
36:38;36:42;"And they kind of cover the basketball,"
36:42;36:44;"and then once he retired,"
36:44;36:46;"they're kind of just like talk about"
36:46;36:49;"how much he loved to work and make money."
36:49;36:51;"And the documentary, I mean,"
36:51;36:53;"obviously it's a bit of a puff piece."
36:53;36:57;"They kind of imply that Shaq is the one who, right,"
36:58;37:00;"that Shaq kind of paved the way."
37:00;37:03;"He took what Michael Jordan did as being a spokesman"
37:03;37:04;"and took it to the next level."
37:04;37:07;"He creates his own brand early, and he's out there,"
37:07;37:12;"and he's often foregoing a payday for equity in the company."
37:12;37:14;"He says, ""People think I'm an athlete"
37:14;37:15;"""who got into business."
37:15;37:18;"""I'm a businessman who happens to be athletic."""
37:18;37:19;"It's deep."
37:19;37:21;"And I thought, right on."
37:21;37:25;"And so anyway, I think in the post-Shaq universe"
37:25;37:26;"and just in the 2000s,"
37:26;37:29;"I guess it's possible that some of these celebrities,"
37:29;37:30;"somebody goes in and says,"
37:30;37:33;"""This is gonna be the next Doritos."""
37:33;37:34;"I could totally picture it."
37:34;37:37;"In 2007, you're going on a road show"
37:37;37:39;"meeting all these big Hollywood managers and stuff"
37:39;37:41;"and music industry people,"
37:41;37:44;"and you say, ""Guys, Doritos, it's so '90s."
37:44;37:46;"""You're getting the cheese dust on your fingers."
37:46;37:48;"""People today want something new,"
37:48;37:51;"""and this is like a trillion-dollar market,"

38:04;38:05;"""All those things that you grew up eating,"
38:05;38:07;"""the greasy lays, all that stuff,"

38:09;38:12;"This company, especially if it goes global,"
38:12;38:16;"we get to dial in the flavors for Southeast Asia,"
38:16;38:18;"South America, if we dial that in,"
38:18;38:21;"this company easily is doing,"
38:21;38:22;"just like very confidently be like,"
38:22;38:27;"""4.7 billion a year in revenue in five years."""
38:27;38:29;"And maybe you can go to the Katy Perry's"
38:29;38:31;"and the Puffy's and say,"
38:31;38:34;"""We're prepared to offer you 1.5% of this company."""
38:34;38:36;"They're doing the math, and they're like,"
38:36;38:39;"""Four billion, 1.5%?"""
38:39;38:40;"What is that, Seinfeld?"
38:40;38:42;"- Oh yeah, that's like--"
38:42;38:44;"- 600 million? - 600 million, yeah."
38:44;38:47;"- Wait, no, that's not-- - 60 million."
38:47;38:49;"- 60 million. - 50, 60 million."
38:49;38:53;"- Yeah, so you pick four celebrities,"
38:53;38:56;"Katy Perry, Ashton Kutcher, Puffy, David Ortiz,"
38:56;38:59;"and you promise each of them 1.5% and say,"
38:59;39:00;"""I know that's a small number,"
39:00;39:04;"""but please, our projections say 4.8 billion."""
39:04;39:04;"Yeah, and then they're starting to think,"
39:04;39:09;"""I'm making 60 to 80 million a year for doing very little?"""
39:09;39:10;"And then it's like, ""No, no, but hold on,"
39:10;39:12;"""we'll make sure you like the product."""
39:12;39:13;"Hold on a second."
39:13;39:15;"Take a bite."
39:15;39:18;"I do like it, this is exactly the type of,"
39:18;39:20;"first you talk the money, then you offer them the product."
39:20;39:22;"- So 1.5-- - I wanna get into this world,"
39:22;39:23;"it's kind of exciting to me."
39:23;39:26;"- It is. - I wanna go pre-sell shares"
39:26;39:28;"of a lame snack company and see"
39:28;39:30;"what the biggest celebrity we can get is."
39:30;39:35;"Just go and just be like, some terrible Puffy chip,"
39:35;39:38;"just see, can we make it to Bruno Mars,"
39:38;39:41;"and just be like, ""Bruno, all the money's gone into R&D."
39:41;39:44;"""If you're with us,"" I can't believe I'm saying this,"
39:44;39:45;"""20% of the company."""
39:45;39:48;"- What about this, you know, most chips are dry."
39:48;39:51;"What about a moist, like a soggy chip?"
39:51;39:51;"You know what I mean?"
39:51;39:53;"- A wet chip. - A wet chip."
39:53;39:56;"Like, it's not oily, it's H2O infused."
39:56;40:00;"And it's got a certain sort of liquid viscous."
40:00;40:02;"Anyway, Ezra, you nailed it."
40:02;40:04;"- Wet chips."
40:04;40:07;"- It's like when you have your chips on a plate"
40:07;40:09;"and you accidentally spill some water on it."
40:09;40:10;"- Yeah, and be like, ""And people,"
40:10;40:13;"""and yeah, you think that people don't want that anymore,"
40:13;40:15;"""but Mr. Obama, I'm sorry,"
40:15;40:16;"""but since you left the White House,"
40:16;40:19;"""doesn't culture feel kind of dry?"""
40:19;40:20;"You know what I mean?"
40:20;40:22;"- They want it wet."
40:22;40:23;"- I can't believe I'm saying this, Brock,"
40:23;40:26;"but if you get on board for this"
40:26;40:29;"and you film two to seven commercials,"
40:29;40:31;"we'll give you 99% of the company."
40:31;40:33;"I mean, we're nuts, we're nuts,"
40:33;40:35;"but that's how much we believe in this."
40:35;40:39;"- I mean, Michelle Obama was very pro-hydration, pro-health."
40:39;40:40;"You know, you could just like,"
40:40;40:42;"""We need more water in our chips."""
40:42;40:45;"Katy Perry was an investor in pop chips."
40:45;40:48;"LA Times 2012 reports that,"
40:48;40:49;"it all started with a tweet."
40:49;40:51;"She was promoting part of me."
40:51;40:51;"I don't know if you remember, Jake,"
40:51;40:55;"her concert documentary part of me."
40:55;40:56;"- Sure, of course. - Oh yeah, it was very good."
40:56;40:59;"- I think she broke up with Russell Brand in that one."
40:59;41:00;"Anyway. - I saw that in the theater."
41:00;41:03;"- Yeah. - Twice."
41:03;41:04;"- I was on tour and I caught it."
41:04;41:07;"Yeah, it was cool. - It seemed spectacular."
41:07;41:11;"So she says she found this in a mini bar in a hotel"
41:11;41:12;"when she was promoting the film."
41:12;41:13;"She read the back of the label,"
41:13;41:14;"saw that it was a healthy choice."
41:14;41:16;"She was hooked after her first bite."
41:16;41:17;"When I discover something good,"
41:17;41:18;"I wanna share it with everyone."
41:18;41:21;"So I tweeted about it and the rest is history."
41:21;41:22;"- Very organic."
41:22;41:26;"- She just, an unsolicited promotional tweet."
41:26;41:26;"- So when it says she's an investor,"
41:26;41:28;"that implies she put in her own money."
41:28;41:29;"So that is pretty different."
41:29;41:31;"- And she became a spokesperson for it."
41:31;41:34;"- Well, yeah, maybe we gotta steal the actual deal points."
41:34;41:35;"Maybe she just reached out to them"
41:35;41:37;"and said, ""I'll be a spokesperson."""
41:37;41:39;"- And just kick in 1.5."
41:39;41:41;"- I'm sure it worked out for her."
41:41;41:43;"Okay, but why was it in the hotel in the first place?"
41:43;41:44;"It was just like a regional snack?"
41:44;41:46;"- It does feel like something that would be in a mini bar"
41:46;41:47;"where you're like, ""I have a--"""
41:47;41:48;"- I don't believe any of that."
41:48;41:49;"- Yeah, after that."
41:49;41:50;"- I don't believe any of that."
41:50;41:51;"- You think Katie's lying?"
41:51;41:52;"- I mean, no, I think that--"
41:52;41:53;"- So cynical, Nick."
41:53;41:54;"- Well, I'm reading this article,"
41:54;41:56;"which is essentially that they brought on the guy"
41:56;41:59;"that did Vitamin Water to basically be the consultant"
41:59;42:00;"or partner in Popchips."
42:00;42:03;"And this says he did exactly what he did"
42:03;42:04;"with Vitamin Water, which was bring on--"
42:04;42:05;"- Go to the celebs."
42:05;42:09;"- Yep, you know, 50 Cent, famous Vitamin Water owner,"
42:09;42:11;"sold out for however many hundreds of millions of dollars."
42:11;42:13;"So they first went to Ashton Kutcher."
42:13;42:14;"The funny part is, is they said,"
42:14;42:16;"""You create any kind of chip you want."""
42:16;42:19;"It seems here he created the Bombay chip."
42:19;42:20;"(all laughing)"
42:20;42:21;"- Oh no."
42:21;42:22;"- I swear to God."
42:22;42:24;"- So it was Bombay flavored."
42:24;42:26;"And then he was like, ""Yeah, and then I'll do,"" I mean."
42:26;42:28;"- It's possible that the entire thing,"
42:28;42:31;"it's not just an accident that Ashton Kutcher"
42:31;42:35;"ended up doing this brown face Indian character."
42:35;42:38;"It's actually when they asked him what flavor he wanted,"
42:38;42:40;"he said, ""Anything that allows me to do this character"
42:40;42:42;"""I've been working on."""
42:42;42:45;"- Yeah, and then two months after that,"
42:45;42:47;"Katy Perry signs on."
42:47;42:48;"- I'm with you, I don't--"
42:48;42:49;"- To do Katy's kettle corn,"
42:49;42:52;"and then immediately after that, it's--"
42:52;42:53;"- Puffy?"
42:53;42:55;"- Well, yep, it's, well, here are the rest of them."
42:55;42:57;"It's gonna say that it's"
42:57;42:59;"Jillian Michaels, Heidi Klum, and Diddy."
42:59;43:00;"- Heidi Klum."
43:00;43:03;"- So, I mean, this is, there's just no,"
43:03;43:04;"this isn't an organic--"
43:04;43:05;"- Yeah."
43:05;43:06;"- How did David Ortiz get--"
43:06;43:07;"(laughing)"
43:07;43:08;"- He's passionate about snack food."
43:08;43:09;"- That's a weird one."
43:09;43:10;"- Well, yeah, no, I hate to say it"
43:10;43:13;"because I'm a Katy Perry fan."
43:13;43:14;"I think she's cool."
43:14;43:17;"But, you know, hopefully she wouldn't mind us"
43:17;43:19;"just kicking the tires."
43:19;43:20;"It's just business."
43:20;43:24;"All I'm saying is that I think Katy's a savvy businesswoman,"
43:24;43:26;"and it's possible that she sat down"
43:26;43:28;"with the Vitamin Water guy."
43:28;43:31;"They said, ""Listen, we got Ashton Kutcher on board,"
43:31;43:32;"""and no, we're not punking you."
43:32;43:34;"""You're about to be a billionaire."""
43:34;43:35;"And she said, ""Okay, I like what I hear."""
43:35;43:36;"And then they gave her the product,"
43:36;43:38;"and they said, ""But here's the thing."
43:38;43:40;"""Vitamin Water, people saw it in stores first."
43:40;43:42;"""They kind of half felt like they discovered it"
43:42;43:45;"""by the time they heard 50 Cent was a big investor."
43:45;43:47;"""They kind of felt like they were all in on it together."
43:47;43:49;"""We don't want this to feel top-down."
43:49;43:53;"""Help us craft a narrative that feels like you"
43:53;43:55;"""that kind of makes it sound like you discovered it."""
43:55;44:00;"Because, also, so you said this was all happening in 2007?"
44:00;44:02;"- Well, the PopChip was created in 2007."
44:02;44:04;"I think it became a business then,"
44:04;44:07;"but 2012 was when Katy Perry, I think, came into the fold."
44:07;44:09;"- Oh, so it's exactly the Obama era."
44:09;44:11;"So they're probably talking to her"
44:11;44:14;"about how the Obama campaign had a feeling"
44:14;44:15;"of being grassroots, even though"
44:15;44:17;"there was also big money behind it."
44:17;44:20;"So I bet they said, ""Just when you announced it,"
44:20;44:22;"""let's make it seem like you discovered it,"
44:22;44:25;"""not that we came to you selling you on it."""
44:25;44:27;"And then she says, ""I just happened to find this"
44:27;44:30;"""in my hotel room, and I love it,"
44:30;44:31;"""and I wanna share it with you."""
44:31;44:34;"It's a good grassroots rollout campaign."
44:34;44:37;"- Does the Four Seasons stock that chip in their minibar?"
44:37;44:39;"- Yeah, we gotta find out, we gotta do some digging."
44:39;44:42;"- I do feel like PopChips does have a minibar feel to it,"
44:42;44:44;"because you open that minibar,"
44:44;44:45;"and it's sort of like seven out of the 10 things,"
44:45;44:46;"you're like, ""What, I'm not, what?"""
44:46;44:47;"- Absolutely, but--"
44:47;44:50;"- But at a fancy hotel, I'm thinking Kettle Chip."
44:50;44:52;"- But Kettle Chip is not as healthy as--"
44:52;44:53;"- I mean, at a really fancy hotel,"
44:53;44:55;"they're gonna take the products sometimes"
44:55;44:57;"and put them in their own packaging."
44:57;44:59;"So you get your little Four Seasons gummy bears"
44:59;45:01;"or something, your Four Seasons salted cashews."
45:01;45:05;"Also, the way that PopChips look is so slick and corporate"
45:05;45:07;"that just the, it'd be one thing if you found"
45:07;45:10;"some mom and pop fudge company,"
45:10;45:14;"you're just like, ""Guys, next time you're in"
45:14;45:17;"""Youngstown, Ohio, you gotta try this."
45:17;45:18;"""It's such a cool little place."""
45:18;45:21;"They're just thinking about picking up PopChips,"
45:21;45:25;"and then just being like, ""I need to share this with people."""
45:25;45:28;"- It doesn't track."
45:28;45:29;"- It doesn't track."
45:29;45:34;"- It's not, yeah, it's not a Sweet Martha's cookie, you know?"
45:34;45:35;"- Oh, not at all."
45:35;45:36;"I mean, it would be like--"
45:36;45:38;"- I mean, even the packaging looks so corporate."
45:38;45:40;"It just looks, like I'm reading here--"
45:40;45:42;"- Maybe that's her aesthetic."
45:42;45:43;"- Yeah."
45:43;45:45;"- Maybe that really spoke to her."
45:45;45:46;"- It's possible, it's possible."
45:46;45:48;"- Very cold corporate packaging."
45:48;45:50;"She was just like, ""Damn."""
45:50;45:52;"- It's late at night, she's on the promotional circuit."
45:52;45:54;"She's had a few drinks in her."
45:54;45:56;"She's come across the PopChips,"
45:56;45:58;"and she's tweeting without--"
45:58;45:59;"- She's looking at the calorie count"
45:59;46:02;"on the back of each one of these things, right?"
46:02;46:05;"- She goes, ""This seems like the healthiest alternative."""
46:05;46:07;"- It's 20 less calories--"
46:07;46:08;"(laughing)"
46:08;46:09;"- It's 4 a.m."
46:09;46:11;"- Than the KettleChips."
46:11;46:13;"- Right, it's 3 to 4 a.m., you know?"
46:13;46:15;"- Been traveling all day, skipped dinner."
46:15;46:17;"- Judgment is way off."
46:17;46:20;"- Her social media managers, there she goes,"
46:20;46:21;"writing about PopChips again."
46:21;46:24;"- Katie, not for free, come on."
46:24;46:26;"- This is the most I've ever thought about Katie Perry."
46:26;46:28;"- Really, are you a fan?"
46:28;46:30;"- No, not a fan."
46:30;46:32;"I like Teenage Dream."
46:32;46:32;"- Yeah, it's a good song."

01:04:51;01:04:54;"- Not detailed, metaphorically I think."
01:04:54;01:04:57;"- She'll eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer."

01:05:01;01:05:04;"- Smart investor. - And smart investor, perhaps."

01:05:06;01:05:08;"very strong halftime show."
01:05:08;01:05:10;"- Oh yeah, she did a famous halftime show."
01:05:10;01:05:11;"- One of the best."
01:05:11;01:05:15;"- I think you can catch her hosting American Idol."
01:05:15;01:05:16;"- Still?"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"- Yeah, 8 p.m. on Fox."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"Well check your local listings."
01:05:19;01:05:22;"- I wonder if she still rides for Popchips."
01:05:22;01:05:23;"- Wow, still?"
01:05:23;01:05:24;"- No, I mean she's huge."
01:05:24;01:05:29;"Also, those kind of gigs hosting American Idol,"
01:05:29;01:05:31;"I think the host, they're probably making more money"
01:05:31;01:05:33;"doing that than they made grinding it out"
01:05:33;01:05:35;"in their arena tours."
01:05:35;01:05:37;"Okay."
01:05:37;01:05:39;"Moving on."
01:05:39;01:05:40;"- Deep sigh."
01:05:40;01:05:43;"This is 25 minutes on Katy Perry."
01:05:43;01:05:44;"- Oh man."
01:05:44;01:05:49;"There was a Bob Dylan interview during our hiatus"
01:05:49;01:05:50;"that made some waves,"
01:05:50;01:05:53;"at least in the Bob Dylan fan community."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"Bob sat down with the Wall Street Journal."
01:05:55;01:05:56;"- Yeah."
01:05:56;01:05:58;"- In the interview, people were excited"
01:05:58;01:06:03;"because Bob talked a bunch about music that he liked."
01:06:03;01:06:07;"He was talking about younger musicians"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"that he's found interesting."
01:06:09;01:06:12;"I know he said something about Grace Potter,"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"Julian Casablanca."
01:06:14;01:06:17;"He very specifically wrote Julian Casablanca,"
01:06:17;01:06:19;"which I think knowing Bob is some,"
01:06:19;01:06:21;"I don't know why, somehow it's on purpose."
01:06:21;01:06:24;"Jack White, Rag and Bone Man."
01:06:24;01:06:29;"But also, he says something about a Duff McKagan solo song."
01:06:29;01:06:32;"And you know, Duff McKagan famous as a member"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"of Guns N' Roses."
01:06:34;01:06:36;"I'm sure he's got some cool solo music,"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"but it's not something I've heard"
01:06:38;01:06:39;"that many people talk about."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"So to have the great Bob Dylan shout him out"
01:06:41;01:06:42;"was pretty interesting."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"And he doesn't just shout him out as just like,"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"Bob, you know, who are some artists you like?"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"You know, Duff McKagan's doing his thing."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"He really goes hard for him."
01:06:50;01:06:52;"They ask, how do you discover new music?"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"This was the question Bob was asked."
01:06:54;01:06:58;"Said, mostly by accident, by chance."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"If I go looking for something, I usually don't find it."
01:07:00;01:07:01;"In fact, I never find it."
01:07:01;01:07:03;"I walk into things intuitively"
01:07:03;01:07:06;"when I'm most likely not looking for anything."
01:07:06;01:07:09;"There's a Duff McKagan song called ""Chip Away"""
01:07:09;01:07:11;"that has profound meaning for me."
01:07:11;01:07:14;"It's a graphic song, chip away, chip away,"
01:07:14;01:07:16;"like Michelangelo breaking up solid marble stone"
01:07:16;01:07:19;"to discover the form of King David inside."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"He didn't build him from the ground up."
01:07:20;01:07:24;"He chipped away the stone until he discovered the king."
01:07:24;01:07:25;"It's like my own songwriting."
01:07:25;01:07:28;"I overwrite something, then I chip away lines and phrases"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"until I get to the real thing."
01:07:30;01:07:31;"Shooter Jennings produced that record."
01:07:31;01:07:32;"It's a great song."
01:07:32;01:07:34;"- Duff was just like, oh, hell yeah."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"- I mean, yeah. - Come in full circle too"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"after G&R covering, you know,"
01:07:38;01:07:41;"maybe this is Bob's way of paying back Duff"
01:07:41;01:07:43;"and Guns N' Roses."
01:07:43;01:07:46;"After they covered ""Knocking on Heaven's Door,"""
01:07:46;01:07:47;"we covered this on the show."
01:07:47;01:07:48;"I mean, Bob was just sort of like--"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"- Kind of a breadhead at the time."
01:07:50;01:07:53;"He just wanted the money and he made a lot of money."
01:07:53;01:07:56;"- Hey, Axl, why don't you cover more of my songs?"
01:07:56;01:07:58;"- Yeah, wait, that was the real thing."
01:07:58;01:08:00;"And then Axl said--"
01:08:00;01:08:04;"- Oh, actually, Bob, I gotta say, sir,"
01:08:04;01:08:05;"we, as you might've heard,"
01:08:05;01:08:08;"we've been covering ""Knocking on Heaven's Door"" in concert"
01:08:08;01:08:11;"and I hope you understand how much we look up to you"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"and how covering your song is our way of honoring you"
01:08:13;01:08:16;"and your contribution to American music."
01:08:16;01:08:19;"And we actually do have plans on recording it in the studio."
01:08:19;01:08:20;"- You should put it on your next record."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"- Actually, we're thinking about it"
01:08:22;01:08:23;"and it'd be so meaningful."
01:08:23;01:08:25;"- You should make it a single."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"- We might, Bob, but first and foremost,"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"we just want you to understand how much we look up to you,"
01:08:29;01:08:32;"admire your song craft, what you've done with your career,"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"everything you've contributed"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"to the American musical ecosystem."
01:08:36;01:08:39;"- Well, if it makes me money, that sounds good to me, son."
01:08:39;01:08:40;"- Oh, all right. - Maybe one of those"
01:08:40;01:08:41;"- Market clubs."
01:08:41;01:08:42;"(laughing)"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"- All right, Bob."
01:08:43;01:08:45;"- I don't work here."
01:08:45;01:08:46;"- Yeah, I don't work here."
01:08:46;01:08:49;"(laughing)"
01:08:49;01:08:52;"He's just like in their dressing room."
01:08:52;01:08:54;"He just barged in."
01:08:54;01:08:55;"- Sure."
01:08:55;01:08:56;"- The last one."
01:08:56;01:08:58;"- Bob, that is the last one."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"I don't give a (beep)"
01:08:59;01:09:02;"- So he was a Duff guy."
01:09:02;01:09:03;"- Duff head."
01:09:03;01:09:04;"- But yeah, it's classic."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"- Speaking of Duff."
01:09:05;01:09:07;"(laughing)"
01:09:07;01:09:10;"- It's classic Bob to be,"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"well, first of all, let's throw it on because."
01:09:12;01:09:13;"- Yeah, I've actually never heard the song."
01:09:13;01:09:17;"I meant to look it up after we texted about this."

01:13:38;01:13:40;"""Just saying, I'm right there with Bob."""
01:13:40;01:13:42;"And then I said, ""Didn't know you were David head."
01:13:42;01:13:45;"""Is it number one across all art forms for you?"""
01:13:45;01:13:48;"Jake said, ""Generally not a huge sculpture fan,"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"""but it's the scale of David that makes it so amazing."
01:13:50;01:13:52;"""Like, I don't understand how he did it."
01:13:52;01:13:54;"""It seems otherworldly."
01:13:54;01:13:56;"""In terms of iconic world historical art pieces,"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"""it's a funny conversation to have."
01:13:58;01:13:59;"""David is the goat, bro."""
01:13:59;01:14:02;"So Jake says, ""Greatest work of art, the David."
01:14:02;01:14:04;"""Greatest rock song, Bob O'Reilly."""
01:14:04;01:14:06;"But by work of art, you mean anything"
01:14:06;01:14:11;"that a human being made to express themselves with."
01:14:11;01:14:13;"- I think I meant greatest work of art in this context,"
01:14:13;01:14:14;"visual art."
01:14:14;01:14:15;"- Okay, but--"
01:14:15;01:14:17;"- You know, like a painting or a sculpture."
01:14:17;01:14:18;"- All right, but like, you know,"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"this is single elimination."
01:14:20;01:14:22;"It's March Madness time."
01:14:22;01:14:25;"You got it down to the David on one conference,"
01:14:25;01:14:28;"in the Eastern Conference, Bob O'Reilly in the Western."
01:14:28;01:14:29;"Now let's get serious."
01:14:29;01:14:32;"Which is better, the David or Bob O'Reilly?"
01:14:32;01:14:33;"- Damn."
01:14:33;01:14:35;"You stumped me on this one, man."
01:14:35;01:14:37;"- I would just, yeah, that was interesting to me."
01:14:37;01:14:37;"- You stumped me."
01:14:37;01:14:39;"- That you love the David so much."
01:14:39;01:14:40;"So you like the David more than--"
01:14:40;01:14:43;"- Well, it's just like one of those things"
01:14:43;01:14:46;"where you're just like, it's so huge."
01:14:46;01:14:48;"Yeah, so I asked if you guys had seen it in person."
01:14:48;01:14:48;"- No, I've never been to Florence."
01:14:49;01:14:51;"- It's at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence."
01:14:51;01:14:55;"It's okay, we've all seen old classical sculptures"
01:14:55;01:14:57;"of the naked male form."
01:14:57;01:14:58;"- Sure."
01:14:58;01:14:59;"- They're everywhere."
01:14:59;01:15:00;"You go to a museum, you go to the Getty."
01:15:00;01:15:01;"- Sure."
01:15:01;01:15:02;"- There's a bunch of them there."
01:15:02;01:15:04;"But this thing is like, Seinfeld number crunch?"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"What's the height of the David?"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"It's immense."
01:15:08;01:15:09;"It's on a pedestal."
01:15:09;01:15:12;"I mean, basically the toes start at like,"
01:15:12;01:15:13;"where your eye level is."
01:15:13;01:15:14;"- Jake?"
01:15:14;01:15:15;"- And then, yeah."
01:15:15;01:15:15;"- 17 feet."
01:15:15;01:15:16;"- Okay, I was gonna guess 20."
01:15:16;01:15:18;"- Oh, that's a big boy."
01:15:18;01:15:19;"- It doesn't sound like a lot, but when you see it--"
01:15:19;01:15:20;"- It's larger than life."
01:15:20;01:15:25;"- It's this immense, perfect sculpture of a man"
01:15:25;01:15:28;"out of one, it wasn't like, put together like Bob was saying."
01:15:28;01:15:31;"It was one giant block of marble."
01:15:31;01:15:34;"I just don't understand, I guess I like it so much"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"'cause I just don't understand how he did it."
01:15:36;01:15:40;"A painting, 'cause I'm a painter, I've done a lot of it."
01:15:40;01:15:41;"There are paintings I see where I'm just like,"
01:15:41;01:15:42;"I don't know how they did that."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"But I kinda still maybe can figure it out."
01:15:44;01:15:46;"- Even some of the greatest paintings of all time."
01:15:46;01:15:47;"- You're just like, okay, I can kind of see how they did that."
01:15:47;01:15:50;"- And also, with the painting, no disrespect to the art form,"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"but you can do a lot of cheating."
01:15:52;01:15:56;"So, you know, like sometimes the X-ray, Leonardo da Vinci,"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"he's considered, he's a top guy."
01:15:58;01:15:59;"He's big in that world."
01:15:59;01:16:02;"- Top guy, top guy, nick ratings."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"- Then they look through it, turns out,"
01:16:04;01:16:07;"he was painting over little flubs, he was using a pencil."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"- He'd make mistakes."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"- Do you respect that?"
01:16:10;01:16:11;"When a guy uses a pencil?"
01:16:11;01:16:12;"- Absolutely."
01:16:12;01:16:13;"- You respect that?"
01:16:13;01:16:14;"- Oh, yeah."
01:16:14;01:16:15;"- It's not cheating?"
01:16:15;01:16:15;"- Not cheating."
01:16:15;01:16:18;"- One thing they should have to say at the gallery, though."
01:16:18;01:16:20;"You know, when I paint a picture of like a Pizza Hut"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"or Cheesecake Factory, I'm free-handing."
01:16:22;01:16:25;"I'm not using any sort of pencils or rulers"
01:16:25;01:16:26;"or any sort of rejection system."
01:16:26;01:16:27;"- See, that's what I'm talking about."
01:16:27;01:16:30;"- I just know intuitively the perfect shape"
01:16:30;01:16:32;"of every little piece of tile and shingle."
01:16:32;01:16:33;"- 'Cause you studied the--"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"- I can just do that first time out."
01:16:35;01:16:35;"- Because you're a pro."
01:16:35;01:16:37;"- No, and also, that's right,"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"because you're out here selling paintings."
01:16:39;01:16:40;"- Paintings."
01:16:40;01:16:41;"- Paint."
01:16:41;01:16:44;"- Not pencilings, not rulerings."
01:16:44;01:16:44;"- Not sketches."
01:16:44;01:16:46;"- Not sketches."
01:16:46;01:16:47;"Right, 'cause you haven't worked with that."
01:16:47;01:16:48;"Sketches, that's when you take a pencil--"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"- It's oil and canvas, that's all it is."
01:16:50;01:16:51;"- Projection system, that's interesting,"
01:16:51;01:16:54;"'cause there are a lot of hacky, lesser artists"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"using projection systems to--"
01:16:56;01:16:57;"- You're looking at 'em."
01:16:57;01:16:58;"- Oh."
01:16:58;01:16:59;"(laughing)"
01:16:59;01:17:00;"- You don't use a projection system?"
01:17:00;01:17:03;"- I'll use an Epson digital projector"
01:17:03;01:17:07;"to transfer the information that I plan out."
01:17:07;01:17:08;"- See, this is the thing."
01:17:08;01:17:10;"- I transfer the information onto the canvas."
01:17:10;01:17:11;"- I took you at face value,"
01:17:11;01:17:14;"just like I took Katy Perry's mini fridge, mini bar store."
01:17:14;01:17:15;"- Okay, but you always paint them."
01:17:15;01:17:18;"You're not using 3D printers yet."
01:17:18;01:17:18;"- They are painted."
01:17:18;01:17:20;"- Okay, by hand."
01:17:20;01:17:21;"- By hand."
01:17:21;01:17:22;"- Your hand."
01:17:22;01:17:23;"- My hand."
01:17:23;01:17:23;"- It's a mechanical hand."
01:17:23;01:17:25;"(laughing)"
01:17:25;01:17:26;"Actually, you know, Bob--"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"- Yeah, quote unquote, my hand."
01:17:28;01:17:30;"- Bob, yes, it's my hand."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"It belongs to nobody else."
01:17:32;01:17:37;"I paid $25,999 for it from a Korean robotics company,"
01:17:37;01:17:40;"and it's mine."
01:17:40;01:17:42;"And when I said it was my hand, I meant it was my hand."
01:17:42;01:17:46;"You know, Bob got in trouble because when the book came out,"
01:17:46;01:17:49;"the song book, he, I don't wanna say he,"
01:17:49;01:17:52;"I don't wanna put it all on the great Bob, but--"
01:17:52;01:17:52;"- The publisher."
01:17:52;01:17:56;"- The publisher was selling these expensive signed copies"
01:17:56;01:17:59;"as is typical, and I guess they found out"
01:17:59;01:18:02;"that a lot of them were signed,"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"they kind of used some fancy word,"
01:18:04;01:18:08;"like using some kind of like auto signer."
01:18:08;01:18:08;"- Right."
01:18:08;01:18:09;"- What am I, you mean a printer?"
01:18:09;01:18:10;"You mean just like a stamp?"
01:18:10;01:18:11;"I don't know what they mean."
01:18:11;01:18:14;"But, and then, you know, you gotta feel for Bob."
01:18:14;01:18:18;"Man's in his 80s, and he said he did start to sign them,"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"and then he had like vertigo or some kind of health issue"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"that made it impossible, and there was a deadline,"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"and he was assured by people who worked with him,"
01:18:24;01:18:27;"like this is done, this still counts as your signature."
01:18:27;01:18:29;"Like literally, it is like my hand."
01:18:29;01:18:31;"No, no, Bob, this still counts."
01:18:31;01:18:31;"This is not fake."
01:18:31;01:18:36;"This is still a one of a kind printed Bob Dylan signature"
01:18:36;01:18:38;"that you authorized, so that's the same."
01:18:38;01:18:39;"And then people found out, they were upset,"
01:18:39;01:18:41;"and he, clearly he felt bad."
01:18:41;01:18:42;"He went, he put out a press release saying,"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"""I was assured that this was normal."
01:18:44;01:18:45;"""It's only because I had vertigo."""
01:18:45;01:18:50;"- Anyway, I love that you're writing for the David so hard."
01:18:50;01:18:51;"- Well, yeah, so you're subtracting,"
01:18:51;01:18:53;"you have this huge block of marble."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"- Right. - You're subtracting."
01:18:54;01:18:56;"And I just, I can't even imagine just like--"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"- Do you think he used pencils?"
01:18:58;01:19:01;"- I have no idea how he does it, how he did it."
01:19:01;01:19:02;"Any of those, any of that sort of art form,"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"but at that scale, I mean--"
01:19:04;01:19:05;"- It was aliens."
01:19:05;01:19:07;"It was ancient aliens."
01:19:07;01:19:08;"I mean, all the, and that's how they--"
01:19:08;01:19:09;"- One mistake."
01:19:09;01:19:10;"Also, it's marble."
01:19:10;01:19:11;"I mean, you're chipping away."
01:19:11;01:19:14;"It's like, what if it like breaks in a weird way?"
01:19:14;01:19:17;"Or like, I just don't understand how you would do that."
01:19:17;01:19:18;"I just don't understand."
01:19:18;01:19:19;"- I mean, all, and does Bernini,"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"I've seen some of the Berninis."
01:19:21;01:19:22;"Those are incredible too."
01:19:22;01:19:23;"- Yeah."
01:19:23;01:19:25;"- How could you even figure that out"
01:19:25;01:19:28;"and have it so hyper-realistic and--"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"- That's one thing that, yeah, I don't think people,"
01:19:30;01:19:32;"I'm sure there are people who are doing it,"
01:19:32;01:19:33;"but you just don't see, like,"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"you know, you go into a gallery in Chelsea,"
01:19:35;01:19:38;"and you're like, ""Oh, marble sculpture."""
01:19:38;01:19:38;"- Right."
01:19:38;01:19:39;"- You just don't see it."
01:19:39;01:19:40;"I don't know."
01:19:40;01:19:42;"- And if somebody was doing it now,"
01:19:42;01:19:43;"you could totally picture a young artist."
01:19:43;01:19:44;"- Machine routered."
01:19:44;01:19:47;"- Yeah, it would totally be 3D printed, machine cut,"
01:19:47;01:19:50;"and it would be some sort of, it'd be like a bit."
01:19:50;01:19:51;"- Right, all this stuff I found,"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"like this internet porn, and they're turning to--"
01:19:53;01:19:54;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
01:19:54;01:19:58;"- This is Mayor Hamburger had (beep) his own (beep)"
01:19:58;01:19:59;"in marble."
01:19:59;01:20:00;"Did you carve it by hand?"
01:20:00;01:20:03;"It's like, no, I sent an email to a factory in China,"
01:20:03;01:20:07;"said, ""I need a three-foot high Mr. Mayor Hamburger's"
01:20:07;01:20:07;"""(beep) his own (beep)."""
01:20:07;01:20:11;"Can you send it to this gallery in Chelsea?"
01:20:11;01:20:12;"Get it by next month?"
01:20:12;01:20:13;"I mean, does that ever, actually,"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"does that ever happen in the art world, Jake,"
01:20:15;01:20:18;"where it's like, because you have the people"
01:20:18;01:20:20;"who still enjoy, I know there's a lot of people,"
01:20:20;01:20:23;"like you paint by hand, you're interested"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"in like the history of painting,"
01:20:25;01:20:28;"you might have some slight different tools"
01:20:28;01:20:29;"at your disposal, but in a way,"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"you are doing what people have been doing"
01:20:31;01:20:34;"for hundreds of years, and kind of an ancient tradition."
01:20:34;01:20:35;"- Thousands."
01:20:35;01:20:36;"- Thousands of years."
01:20:36;01:20:40;"- Going back to the cave paintings in Lascaux in France."
01:20:40;01:20:41;"- Absolutely."
01:20:41;01:20:44;"- An unbroken tradition, whereas today,"
01:20:44;01:20:47;"that you also get these big conceptual artists, right?"
01:20:47;01:20:52;"Basically the idea guys who might come in and just,"
01:20:52;01:20:53;"and maybe their ideas are great,"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"maybe it's some exciting thing,"
01:20:55;01:20:56;"people are gonna walk in the gallery"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"and the first thing you see is the,"
01:20:58;01:21:02;"are there situations where somebody who's studied,"
01:21:02;01:21:05;"painstakingly learned how to sculpt or paint,"
01:21:05;01:21:08;"ends up just kind of like working for,"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"like just an ideas guy?"
01:21:10;01:21:11;"Is that, that happens all the time?"
01:21:11;01:21:12;"- For sure."
01:21:12;01:21:13;"- Like you're somebody who's been like,"
01:21:13;01:21:16;"studying the greats, painting since childhood,"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"went to art school, you're so concerned,"
01:21:18;01:21:19;"then you just get like--"
01:21:19;01:21:19;"- You're working for Jeff Koons,"
01:21:19;01:21:21;"or I mean that's probably a good gig,"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"but yeah, you're working for, absolutely."
01:21:23;01:21:24;"- And maybe they're cool,"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"but maybe it could also just be like a bozo,"
01:21:26;01:21:29;"just being like, ""I need an exact replica of the Mona Lisa."""
01:21:29;01:21:30;"- I'm sure."
01:21:30;01:21:33;"- Except you can write like, ""She sucks,"" on the bottom."
01:21:33;01:21:34;"- There definitely are fine artists"
01:21:34;01:21:37;"that have stuff painted for them in China."
01:21:37;01:21:39;"I mean, it's part of the like conceptual,"
01:21:39;01:21:43;"kind of rigor or story of the art."
01:21:43;01:21:46;"- Like they're making commentary on the global marketplace."
01:21:46;01:21:47;"- Yeah."
01:21:47;01:21:49;"- Capitalism."
01:21:49;01:21:49;"- Yeah."
01:21:49;01:21:50;"And then you're like, ""Okay,"
01:21:50;01:21:53;"""well I have this kind of mediocre painting to show for it."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"""Awesome."""
01:21:54;01:21:54;"- Right."
01:21:54;01:21:55;"- But yeah, I mean, yeah, that's--"
01:21:55;01:21:56;"- More of the story."
01:21:56;01:21:57;"- That's definitely a thing."
01:21:57;01:21:59;"- Okay, but I can see in this context,"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"that the sheer ingenuity of like,"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"""How was the David made?"""
01:22:03;01:22:06;"And why that over any other sculpture you've ever seen?"
01:22:06;01:22:07;"- Just the scale."
01:22:07;01:22:09;"The size of it is just like,"
01:22:09;01:22:10;"you walk into the room and you're just like,"
01:22:10;01:22:13;"""Oh my God, that's crazy."""
01:22:13;01:22:15;"- But you must've seen some other big,"
01:22:15;01:22:16;"what about the Statue of Liberty?"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"Why's it gotta be something Italian?"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"- That's not hand carved out of a piece of marble."
01:22:20;01:22:23;"Although that's true, I don't know how they made that."
01:22:23;01:22:25;"I mean, honestly, Mount Rushmore is pretty impressive."
01:22:25;01:22:28;"(laughing)"
01:22:28;01:22:29;"It's a mountain."
01:22:29;01:22:31;"- James is like, ""Big stuff."""
01:22:31;01:22:33;"- I mean, it's like, if you're Michelangelo"
01:22:33;01:22:34;"and you mess up the David, and maybe he did."
01:22:34;01:22:37;"Maybe this is his third try and he nailed it."
01:22:37;01:22:39;"Mount Rushmore, you kind of only have one shot."
01:22:39;01:22:41;"No, I don't understand that."
01:22:41;01:22:44;"I don't understand how you do that kind of stuff."
01:22:44;01:22:45;"It's wild to me."
01:22:45;01:22:47;"- Has there ever been a movie like,"
01:22:47;01:22:48;"like, you know, Ghostbusters style,"
01:22:48;01:22:50;"where like, the David gets like haunted"
01:22:50;01:22:52;"or like struck by like a lightning"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"or like come to life, kind of like walk around."
01:22:54;01:22:55;"- He gets a big (beep)"
01:22:55;01:22:56;"- Yeah, like gets a big (beep)"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"Has it ever happened?"
01:22:58;01:23:00;"I feel like I've seen it with Mount Rushmore in movies."
01:23:00;01:23:03;"Like George Washington's like, ""Ooh."""
01:23:03;01:23:05;"But like, do you know what I'm talking about?"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"- Oh, you're like a knight at the museum?"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"- Like a knight at the museum style."
01:23:08;01:23:08;"There's Mount Rushmore."
01:23:08;01:23:11;"- That'd be fun to make like a real cheap indie versions,"
01:23:11;01:23:14;"Jake's a knight at the Uffizi Gallery."
01:23:14;01:23:15;"- Yeah, there we go."
01:23:15;01:23:17;"(laughing)"
01:23:17;01:23:21;"- When an American painter finds himself"
01:23:21;01:23:25;"accidentally locked in the Uffizi Gallery"
01:23:25;01:23:26;"in Florence late at night."
01:23:26;01:23:29;"(laughing)"
01:23:29;01:23:32;"He goes face to face with his all time favorite work of art,"
01:23:32;01:23:35;"except the David's like really pissed off or something."
01:23:35;01:23:36;"- Not favorite, greatest."
01:23:36;01:23:38;"- Greatest, I see."
01:23:38;01:23:39;"Now, but I'm with you."
01:23:39;01:23:43;"There have been times when I've seen large scale,"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"like for instance, in Japan,"
01:23:45;01:23:50;"there's a whole bunch of these famous, like huge Buddhas."
01:23:50;01:23:53;"Some of which were made in like around the year 700,"
01:23:53;01:23:56;"for instance, and you see these like really old,"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"sometimes they're made out of bronze or something."
01:23:58;01:24:01;"And just to be like kind of confronted by that."
01:24:01;01:24:05;"Yeah, the scale, it is, it kind of knocks you out."
01:24:05;01:24:06;"- Yeah, I can picture that."
01:24:06;01:24:08;"- Just holding up like a huge hand"
01:24:08;01:24:09;"and in this like beautiful space"
01:24:09;01:24:12;"that was just made for people to come from far and wide,"
01:24:12;01:24:13;"just to like sit and look up"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"at this representation of the Buddha."
01:24:15;01:24:17;"- That reminds me when I went to Mexico City,"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"like five or six years ago,"
01:24:19;01:24:22;"went to the big museum there and there's this huge,"
01:24:22;01:24:23;"I don't know the name of it,"
01:24:23;01:24:27;"but this huge sculpture of like the sun god."
01:24:27;01:24:29;"It's just like mounted onto the wall,"
01:24:29;01:24:32;"but it's all stone, it must weigh like some ungodly amount."
01:24:32;01:24:34;"- Like from the pre-Columbian times, like on Mayans."
01:24:34;01:24:37;"- Yeah, yeah, it's not by like a famous artist."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"- Big sculptures rule."
01:24:38;01:24:42;"And actually, how about down in Rio, the Cristo?"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"- Never seen it, but yeah."
01:24:44;01:24:45;"- But it's like, it's iconic."
01:24:45;01:24:46;"- Yeah, absolutely."
01:24:46;01:24:48;"- It's sick, arms out."
01:24:48;01:24:49;"How big is that boy?"
01:24:49;01:24:50;"Is that a big boy?"
01:24:50;01:24:53;"- Shout out to the Statue of Liberty."
01:24:53;01:24:55;"- Statue of Liberty?"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"How tall is it?"
01:24:56;01:24:59;"- Oh no, no, the one down in Rio."
01:24:59;01:25:00;"- Oh, the Jesus?"
01:25:00;01:25:02;"- Yeah, I always call it the Cristo."
01:25:02;01:25:03;"- Oh yeah, yeah, the Cristo."
01:25:03;01:25:07;"That is 98 feet."
01:25:07;01:25:08;"- Oh, it's massive."
01:25:08;01:25:11;"Right, yeah, 'cause when you see it in like a movie,"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"it's like a helicopter shot, you could be like,"
01:25:13;01:25:15;"what's that, 10 feet?"
01:25:15;01:25:15;"10, 15 feet?"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"- Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't have thought it was that big."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"- Yeah, massive."
01:25:18;01:25:21;"- I mean, it's almost verges sort of"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"into like the seven wonders of the world."
01:25:23;01:25:24;"- Oh yeah."
01:25:24;01:25:25;"- And I went to the--"
01:25:25;01:25:26;"- Colossus of Rhodes."
01:25:26;01:25:26;"- Colossus of Rhodes, yeah."
01:25:26;01:25:29;"- I've been to China once and I went to the Great Wall,"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"which is insane, but I couldn't help but just think"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"of like the slave labor that went into making the--"
01:25:33;01:25:34;"- Right."
01:25:34;01:25:35;"- The Great Wall is sort of beautiful"
01:25:35;01:25:38;"and it's breathtaking and again, it's scale."
01:25:38;01:25:39;"- Right."
01:25:39;01:25:42;"- But it's not like aesthetic in the way that like"
01:25:42;01:25:45;"the sun god, Mexico City, or the David is."
01:25:45;01:25:46;"- Right."
01:25:46;01:25:47;"- It's just like brutal."
01:25:47;01:25:49;"- Last question, you Grand Canyon fan?"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"- This is a great shame."
01:25:51;01:25:52;"I've never been."
01:25:52;01:25:53;"And I need to go. - Oh, interesting."
01:25:53;01:25:54;"- It's on my list."
01:25:54;01:25:55;"Have you been?"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"- No, I've never been."
01:25:56;01:25:57;"In fact, there was--"
01:25:57;01:25:58;"- Road trip."
01:25:58;01:25:59;"- T.C., road trip."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"- I had the chance to go when Vampire Weekend was on tour"
01:26:01;01:26:05;"and I felt like, eh, I don't need to see that."
01:26:05;01:26:05;"- Really, dude?"
01:26:05;01:26:06;"You do."
01:26:06;01:26:07;"- And that's why I'm trying to like reconnect."
01:26:07;01:26:08;"- Let's go."
01:26:08;01:26:11;"- That's why I like that you're ranking the David"
01:26:11;01:26:13;"as the goat because I do feel like there's a lot"
01:26:13;01:26:16;"of just things that feel so familiar to me"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"that I probably would pass up the chance."
01:26:18;01:26:21;"Like I've never gone up to the Statue of Liberty."
01:26:21;01:26:23;"And now I kind of understand as I get older,"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"like no, it's cool to go see these things,"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"even if they seem basic."
01:26:27;01:26:30;"Like I told you how we were in Japan spending time"
01:26:30;01:26:31;"at Mount Fuji."
01:26:31;01:26:32;"- Oh yeah, yeah."
01:26:32;01:26:33;"- And I'd seen it from the plane before,"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"but to actually go right up to it,"
01:26:35;01:26:38;"to go up it a bit, climb up,"
01:26:38;01:26:38;"there was something about it."
01:26:38;01:26:41;"You're like, this is the best mountain in the world."
01:26:41;01:26:42;"(laughing)"
01:26:42;01:26:43;"No, there's a reason."
01:26:43;01:26:44;"- Greatest mountain in the world."
01:26:44;01:26:46;"- Greatest mountain in the world, Mount Fuji."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"Greatest regard, the David."
01:26:47;01:26:49;"Greatest rock song?"
01:26:49;01:26:50;"- Bob O'Reilly."
01:26:50;01:26:54;"- Greatest pop song, ""Hot and Cold"" by Katy Perry."
01:26:54;01:26:54;"All right."
01:26:54;01:26:56;"- Teenage Dream."
01:26:56;01:26:58;"- Let's get into the top five."

01:27:06;01:27:08;"- We're gonna be comparing the top five hits right now"
01:27:08;01:27:09;"with 1989."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"Why 1989?"
01:27:10;01:27:11;"I actually have no idea."
01:27:11;01:27:13;"- 'Cause this is episode 189."
01:27:13;01:27:15;"- Okay, wow."
01:27:15;01:27:17;"That's crazy."
01:27:17;01:27:19;"We've created hundreds of hours of content."

01:28:06;01:28:06;"- Yeah."
01:28:06;01:28:09;"- Like an intimate kind of view of the tour."

01:39:57;01:39:58;"And at the time I was kind of thinking,"
01:39:58;01:40:00;"well, like, yeah, it's like,"
01:40:00;01:40:02;"obviously you dump stuff into it,"
01:40:02;01:40:03;"and you call it a dumpster,"
01:40:03;01:40:05;"'cause that's like what makes it a thing."
01:40:05;01:40:07;"And I was kind of like, that vaguely made sense."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"But actually the reason it's called a dumpster"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"is that the dumpsters, we know it,"
01:40:11;01:40:14;"was invented by the Dempster brothers."
01:40:14;01:40:15;"- Oh, wow, okay."
01:40:15;01:40:18;"And they just like, nah, it's a dumpster."
01:40:18;01:40:21;"- No, like if they had been like the Kowalski brothers,"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"it'd be called the Dumpski."
01:40:23;01:40:26;"- But their name sounds already like dumpster."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"That's almost-- - No, no, that's my point."
01:40:28;01:40:30;"Is that their last-- - Dempster's too Jewish."
01:40:30;01:40:32;"- No, no. - We gotta go with dumpster."
01:40:32;01:40:35;"- No, if they were Jewish, we'd be called Dumpstein."
01:40:38;01:40:39;"- If they were Polish-- - Oh, man,"
01:40:39;01:40:42;"someone just dumped their trash in the dumpsteen again."
01:40:42;01:40:43;"- In the dumpsteen."
01:40:43;01:40:48;"- You gotta put a padlock on that dumpsteen, man,"
01:40:48;01:40:51;"otherwise this is gonna get crashed."
01:40:51;01:40:53;"- 2020 is a dumpsteen fire."
01:40:53;01:40:58;"If they were Polish, it would be a Dumpski."
01:40:58;01:41:00;"And if they were Italian, it might've been like Dumpio."
01:41:00;01:41:04;"- Okay, Dempster brothers wiki."
01:41:04;01:41:06;"Dempster dumped, okay."
01:41:06;01:41:08;"This is amazing."
01:41:08;01:41:10;"The Dempster Dumpmaster."
01:41:10;01:41:11;"- Dumpmaster?"
01:41:11;01:41:14;"- Dumpmaster is great."
01:41:14;01:41:17;"The Dempster Dumpmaster introduced in the 1950s"
01:41:17;01:41:20;"was the first commercially successful"
01:41:20;01:41:22;"front-loading garbage truck in the United States."
01:41:22;01:41:24;"It was a truck."
01:41:24;01:41:27;"The product uses the Dempster dumpster system"
01:41:27;01:41:33;"of mechanically emptying standardized metal containers,"
01:41:33;01:41:36;"which had been patented by the company in 1937."
01:41:36;01:41:39;"It had arms in the front to pick up the dumpster"
01:41:39;01:41:42;"and lifted it over the cab to tip it into the hopper."
01:41:42;01:41:43;"- 'Cause that's what a dumpster is."
01:41:43;01:41:46;"It's a big thing that a specialized truck"
01:41:46;01:41:47;"can pick up and dump."
01:41:47;01:41:48;"- Exactly."
01:41:48;01:41:50;"The rearward traveling compacting panel"
01:41:50;01:41:53;"compressed the garbage stored in the truck"
01:41:53;01:41:56;"and was also used to push it out the door at the back"
01:41:56;01:41:57;"when it was being emptied."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"- But my point--"
01:41:58;01:41:59;"- That's a huge breakthrough."
01:41:59;01:42:00;"- Yeah, so my point is that--"
01:42:00;01:42:01;"- The Dempster dumpster."
01:42:01;01:42:02;"- It's called a dumpster,"
01:42:02;01:42:04;"not just 'cause you add stir to something."
01:42:04;01:42:06;"You would only think to do that"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"if you were one of the Dempsters."
01:42:08;01:42:09;"- Yes."
01:42:09;01:42:10;"- And if they had had a different last name,"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"it could have had a totally different--"
01:42:12;01:42:15;"- The Longstreth brothers, it would have been--"
01:42:15;01:42:16;"- Wouldn't have worked."
01:42:16;01:42:17;"- It would have been a dumpstreth."
01:42:17;01:42:20;"- It just would have just faded into obscurity."
01:42:20;01:42:22;"- Ezra, have you ever--"
01:42:22;01:42:23;"- The Dempster dumpmaster."
01:42:23;01:42:25;"- Have you ever been referred to as a songster?"
01:42:25;01:42:28;"- Okay, yeah, songster, that is something people say."
01:42:28;01:42:30;"I think that's a post-dumpster word."
01:42:30;01:42:32;"And I guess you're right, when you say jester,"
01:42:32;01:42:34;"there are these words that obviously predate dumpster,"
01:42:34;01:42:37;"but I think the idea of you just add stir as a thing,"
01:42:37;01:42:39;"he's a songster."
01:42:39;01:42:40;"Yeah, I think that's post-dumpster,"
01:42:40;01:42:44;"and we owe that to the Dempster brothers' last name."
01:42:44;01:42:45;"- Thank you for your service."
01:42:45;01:42:49;"- And I think actually the patent expired or something,"
01:42:49;01:42:51;"so they don't even own the word anymore."
01:42:51;01:42:53;"- Oh, so the public domain?"
01:42:53;01:42:54;"- Yeah."
01:42:54;01:42:55;"- Get ready for the dumpstreth."
01:42:55;01:42:57;"(laughing)"

01:44:50;01:44:53;"who famously came out before ""New Kids on the Block""."

01:44:58;01:45:00;"- And Bobby Brown was from ""New Edition"", right?"
01:45:00;01:45:01;"- Exactly, yeah."
01:45:01;01:45:04;"- So it's all lining up in '89."
01:45:04;01:45:06;"- And in the weird way that things can work,"
01:45:06;01:45:10;"like this song, ""Honey Success"","

01:45:28;01:45:29;"- Someone else."
01:45:29;01:45:31;"- Skeet Ulrich."

01:48:25;01:48:26;"- I think there's another reason for us"

01:48:52;01:48:54;"because as part of Apple Music,"
01:48:54;01:48:57;"that means we sponsored Rihanna's halftime Super Bowl show."
01:48:57;01:48:58;"- That feels good."
