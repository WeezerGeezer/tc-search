00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, back again. Jake and I reunite in Los Angeles and boy do we have a lot to cover."
00:08;00:14;"Finally, there's news on the Flame and Hot Cheetos movie, the story of Richard Montanez."
00:14;00:23;"All this, plus S.O.D. installation and the top hits of 1992, a very special year."
00:23;00:33;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King. B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:34;00:40;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:40;00:47;"They were a threat to our belief, of my rightful chances"
00:47;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:55;01:02;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:02;01:06;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:06;01:12;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:12;01:17;"We were only there"
01:17;01:23;"Time Crisis back once again. A little bit stuffy. You think my voice sounds weird?"
01:23;01:27;"Post tour? I guess you're on tour, sort of."
01:27;01:32;"Yeah, well, it's funny, that's a question I get a lot, people are like, ""Oh is the tour over?"""
01:32;01:38;"Or like, ""Are you on tour?"" and it's like, ""Man, this is the show that never ends."""
01:38;01:41;"What is it? ""Welcome Back My Friend""?"
01:41;01:45;"Welcome back my friend, to the show that never ends"
01:45;01:48;"I should have said ""Welcome Back My Friend, to the show that never ends."""
01:48;01:50;"Wait, who is that?"
01:50;01:52;"ELO? No, no, no, ELP."
01:52;01:57;"Good call, yeah, definitely not ELO. That's like the big ELP hit."
01:57;02:01;"Along with ""Ooooh, what a lucky man"""
02:01;02:03;"Great song. Yeah, lucky man's song."
02:03;02:06;"Wee-do-do-wee-do-wee-do-wee"
02:06;02:09;"That was a classic Q104.3 jam."
02:09;02:11;"Classic rock radio."
02:11;02:14;"Wait, did you listen to Classic Q in Connecticut?"
02:14;02:17;"No, we didn't get that. We had our own Connecticut classic rock stations."
02:17;02:21;"I-95, Danbury's, Classic Rock Radio, and then"
02:21;02:23;"Just like named after the highway?"
02:23;02:26;"No, because I-95 doesn't go through Danbury. It's weird."
02:26;02:27;"But I-95 goes through Connecticut."
02:27;02:30;"Oh yeah, it goes along, they're like Southern Connecticut."
02:30;02:33;"But I-84 goes through Danbury."
02:33;02:37;"Never quite got a handle on why Danbury's Classic Rock Station was I-95."
02:37;02:40;"Was it because it's like W-H-X-I?"
02:40;02:41;"Something like that."
02:41;02:43;"95.7?"
02:43;02:48;"95.1. W-H-G-I, Danbury's Classic Rock."
02:48;02:50;"And then we had W-P-L-R out of New Haven."
02:50;02:51;"Oh, so you got two Classic Rock?"
02:51;02:52;"We had two, dude."
02:52;02:53;"That explains a lot."
02:53;02:57;"Jake's just getting slammed by two Classic Rock Radio stations."
02:57;03:01;"Getting Eddie money on this station, getting Eddie money on the other station."
03:01;03:02;"R.I.P."
03:02;03:03;"R.I.P., man."
03:03;03:09;"Yeah, it's funny because I only had one Classic Rock Radio station, Classic Q104.3."
03:09;03:12;"And looking back on it, it was fairly idiosyncratic."
03:12;03:18;"I felt like one of the songs they played the most was Jessica by the Allman Brothers, the instrumental."
03:18;03:19;"Yep."
03:19;03:21;"[singing]"
03:21;03:22;"Great one."
03:22;03:23;"Played that a ton."
03:23;03:25;"Not that much Led Zeppelin."
03:25;03:26;"Really?"
03:26;03:28;"I think we've had this conversation before."
03:28;03:33;"They've thrown Billy Joel, where I have this feeling that a Classic Rock Radio station in Florida"
03:33;03:36;"is not going to be dropping New York State of Mind ever."
03:36;03:37;"Right."
03:37;03:39;"That's some regional love."
03:39;03:42;"Who needs a house out in Hackensack?"
03:43;04:01;"[singing]"
04:01;04:03;"Billy's super regional."
04:03;04:05;"Yeah, I feel like it's a classic."
04:05;04:07;"It's just like, ""Oh, so yeah, is the tour over? Are you done?"""
04:07;04:08;"Right."
04:08;04:11;"It'll just be like, ""This leg of the North American tour has ended?"""
04:11;04:16;"But the Father of the Bride cycle continues well into 2020."
04:16;04:18;"Oh, just announced some 2020 dates."
04:18;04:19;"Saw that."
04:19;04:20;"Not that long ago."
04:20;04:23;"Some secondary and tertiary markets."
04:23;04:25;"Looks great, man."
04:25;04:31;"I'm pretty psyched for your inner Pacific Northwest mountain region tour starting in Bend."
04:31;04:33;"Oh, yeah, you got to come tailgate those shows, man."
04:33;04:35;"You're starting in Bend, and then I think you're--"
04:35;04:36;"Hop on the bus."
04:36;04:37;"Where else are you going?"
04:37;04:38;"I think--"
04:38;04:39;"Wait, let me look it up."
04:39;04:40;"Missoula."
04:40;04:41;"Calgary."
04:41;04:42;"Yep."
04:42;04:44;"Great part of the country."
04:44;04:49;"I remember being on some tour that I feel like started in Calgary and went down into--"
04:49;04:53;"maybe ended up in Denver or something, and I just remember being like, ""Wow,"
04:53;04:55;"that's the longest I've ever spent in mountain time."""
04:55;04:56;"Great time zone."
04:56;04:58;"Spent a lot of time in Eastern time."
04:58;04:59;"Sure."
04:59;05:00;"A lot of Pacific time."
05:00;05:02;"It's also the only one with a cool name."
05:02;05:03;"Yeah."
05:03;05:06;"It's interesting how it's like there's no rhyme or reason."
05:06;05:09;"I guess in a real dystopian universe, they would have been called Zone 1, Zone 2,"
05:09;05:10;"Zone 3, and Zone 4."
05:10;05:12;"That's like in the Hunger Games."
05:12;05:13;"Totally."
05:13;05:16;"So Eastern time, that's where we're from."
05:16;05:17;"Yeah."
05:17;05:18;"But it's not Atlantic time."
05:18;05:21;"That would be kind of-- have a little more flavor."
05:21;05:24;"On the two sides of the country, you have Pacific time, which is kind of cool,"
05:24;05:26;"and then you have Eastern time."
05:26;05:28;"Should have been Atlantic time."
05:28;05:29;"I would just rethought that one."
05:29;05:31;"And then you have Central time."
05:31;05:32;"That's pretty bland."
05:32;05:33;"That's a real bland."
05:33;05:35;"Imagine if that was called Heartland time."
05:35;05:36;"Heart time."
05:36;05:37;"Heartbeat."
05:37;05:39;"Yeah, that one, like they don't even use time."
05:39;05:41;"That one's just called heartbeat."
05:41;05:43;"That's kind of like a radio station."
05:43;05:45;"Yeah, the heartbeat of America."
05:45;05:48;"It is 1 p.m. in the heartbeat of America."
05:48;05:50;"Yeah, Eastern time is the big dog."
05:50;05:53;"Big dog, heartbeat, mountain time can stay because that's a good one."
05:53;05:54;"Yeah."
05:54;05:56;"And then golden time."
05:56;06:01;"Yeah, but mountain time is definitely the most interesting of the American time zones."
06:01;06:04;"And I'm sure somebody's going to be like, ""Well, what about like the Hawaii time zone?"""
06:04;06:06;"All right, I'm talking about continental US."
06:06;06:07;"Lower 48."
06:07;06:09;"You're talking lower 48."
06:09;06:11;"That's a tight name for something."
06:11;06:12;"Lower 48."
06:12;06:15;"I was thinking mountain time would be a good song title."
06:15;06:16;"For Mountain Bruce."
06:16;06:18;"Absolutely."
06:18;06:22;"I wonder what the-- I guess is Denver the biggest city in mountain time?"
06:22;06:23;"Might be."
06:23;06:24;"Phoenix."
06:24;06:25;"Is Phoenix mountain time?"
06:25;06:27;"I think it is."
06:27;06:31;"Yeah, Arizona native is-- well, yeah, because it's not the same as LA, right?"
06:31;06:33;"Oh, yeah, it's got to be mountain time."
06:33;06:35;"Yeah, Phoenix is the biggest city in mountain time."
06:35;06:37;"Phoenix, very flat city."
06:37;06:39;"Great number crunching over there."
06:39;06:40;"Thank you, Seinfeld."
06:40;06:42;"Yeah, I just looked it up for you guys."
06:42;06:46;"Yeah, that's interesting to think somebody down in Phoenix, a notoriously flat city,"
06:46;06:49;"are they identifying with mountain time?"
06:49;06:51;"Right, but I feel like they're surrounded by mountains."
06:51;06:53;"Yeah, there are mountains in Arizona."
06:53;06:54;"So what's that leg though?"
06:54;06:55;"You're doing Bend?"
06:55;06:57;"Oh, you're doing Boise, I think."
06:57;06:58;"Oh, yeah, I haven't been there in a while."
06:58;06:59;"What's the venue in Boise?"
06:59;07:00;"Do you know?"
07:00;07:04;"The only two venues that when I think of Boise, I think of Neurolux."
07:04;07:05;"Have you played there?"
07:05;07:06;"Oh, yeah, definitely back in the day."
07:06;07:07;"I played there with Dirty Projectors."
07:07;07:08;"Oh, yeah, I was there."
07:08;07:09;"Hold on."
07:09;07:11;"I got to go to vampireweekend.com to--"
07:11;07:13;"Like a seated auditorium in Boise."
07:13;07:16;"Yeah, my feeling was we talked about what we could do this year."
07:16;07:20;"And it's tough because there's definitely some big cities where the tickets went really fast."
07:20;07:25;"It just felt like, you know what, we'll be back sooner rather than later, next album."
07:25;07:28;"But it seemed cooler just to hit new spots."
07:28;07:30;"Let's see."
07:30;07:33;"Boise, we're playing the Ford Idaho Center Amphitheater."
07:33;07:36;"Missoula, Montana, Kettle House Amphitheater."
07:36;07:39;"I've heard very good things about the Kettle House Amphitheater."
07:39;07:43;"So these are outdoor seated, kind of like a Libby Bowl."
07:43;07:44;"Yeah."
07:44;07:46;"Oh, these ones are next summer."
07:46;07:48;"But that's the way of now."
07:48;07:51;"You just put all your tickets up at the same time, let people know."
07:51;07:54;"So people are buying tickets for a show that's like 10 months from now?"
07:54;07:57;"Yeah, I guess that's kind of the vibe now is like the--"
07:57;08:00;"Because even this year, I think it was smart."
08:00;08:03;"Touring people were just like--they planned the whole year out and they were like,"
08:03;08:05;"""Let's just put all the tickets on sale together."""
08:05;08:09;"And you could probably get in one school and be like, ""Yeah, isn't it more exciting if you wait a little bit to announce the next?"""
08:09;08:11;"And they're just like, ""Just put them all up at the same time."""
08:11;08:13;"You know, they'll do their thing at different rates."
08:13;08:18;"Because when I think about it, we put up the tickets kind of as soon as we were back."
08:18;08:20;"So some of the shows were like four months away."
08:20;08:24;"And then shows like the Garden or the Hollywood Bowl were like seven or eight months away."
08:24;08:29;"That way you let the hardcore fans have like--they can get the tickets really quick."
08:29;08:31;"Actually, there's a big tour for next summer that was just announced."
08:31;08:33;"Are you aware of this?"
08:33;08:35;"Give me a hint."
08:35;08:41;"Three bands more or less associated with pop punk."
08:41;08:43;"Is it Weezer, Green Day?"
08:43;08:44;"Yeah, who else?"
08:44;08:45;"Blink?"
08:45;08:46;"No."
08:46;08:48;"I wonder how Blink feels about this actually."
08:48;08:50;"They just started with Lil Wayne."
08:50;08:55;"But another--Weezer, Green Day, and another like huge--"
08:55;08:58;"Is the third band as big as those bands?"
08:58;09:02;"The third band, I bet you don't know as much about."
09:02;09:05;"They're bigger than Weezer, Green Day, hard to say."
09:05;09:07;"I don't think you're going to guess."
09:07;09:08;"It's Fallout Boy."
09:08;09:09;"Oh, yeah. That's after my time."
09:09;09:11;"You're trying to get Pete Wince on the show for a minute."
09:11;09:13;"He said he was down. I'm going to reach out to him again."
09:13;09:17;"It's a stadium tour. Going big."
09:17;09:18;"The Hella Mega Tour."
09:18;09:20;"It's called the Hella Mega Tour."
09:20;09:21;"Good title."
09:21;09:24;"So that's going to go Fallout Boy, Weezer, Green Day?"
09:24;09:26;"That's the order of events?"
09:26;09:29;"Yeah. Weezer first to three."
09:29;09:31;"Well, actually, there's a--"
09:31;09:32;"Not if I'm booking it."
09:32;09:34;"There's a Scott Punk band called The Interrupters"
09:34;09:37;"who I've been following for a minute as a Scott Punk enthusiast."
09:37;09:38;"That's cool."
09:38;09:41;"They're technically first to four, but the way it's spelled is like,"
09:41;09:45;"""Green Day, Fallout Boy, Weezer, with special guest The Interrupters."""
09:45;09:48;"So, you know, they're kind of--they're kicking things off, but that's different."
09:48;09:53;"So of the big three, Weezer is the lowest ranked."
09:53;09:57;"I don't know one Fallout Boy song, but that's just my--"

10:13;10:15;"I think their heyday was early 2000s,"
10:15;10:18;"and then they kind of broke up or took a beat"
10:18;10:24;"and then came back with like full-on, like pumped-up stadium rock pop kind of stuff."

13:00;13:01;"Pat Stump."
13:01;13:03;"Yeah, why is he not Pat Stump?"

16:37;16:41;"I don't think I've talked about it, but in early days"
16:41;16:44;"when I'd come stay in L.A. for like a week or two,"

16:57;16:59;"you're at the top of a mountain."
16:59;17:02;"I think I've told you how I'd go up to the door of the house"

17:10;17:13;"they'd die instantly,"" you know, like a 1,200-pound animal."
17:13;17:15;"But anyway, so you're up there."
17:15;17:18;"You're right up at kind of the peak of the mountain"
17:18;17:23;"up by Mulholland, and up there, it's almost entirely residential,"
17:23;17:26;"except there's this one little shopping area"
17:26;17:29;"that I think is called like the Beverly Glen Shops or something."
17:29;17:33;"It's one little mini mall up in the hills,"
17:33;17:36;"because otherwise for everything else, you have to go down the hill"
17:36;17:39;"either to the L.A. side or to the valley side."
17:39;17:44;"So up there, there's this one kind of East Coast-ish, Jewish-ish"
17:44;17:47;"deli/diner called the Beverly Glen Deli,"
17:47;17:52;"and it's a funny place where I'd be up there kind of by myself,"
17:52;17:56;"and so I'd be like hilarious, like jump in the car for three minutes,"
17:56;17:59;"get to this place, and if I wanted to have breakfast or a cup of coffee"
17:59;18:02;"or something, I'd go to this spot."
18:02;18:05;"And, you know, it has the charm a little bit"
18:05;18:07;"of kind of like a low-key East Coast deli,"
18:07;18:11;"but it's up in the hills surrounded by not only rich people,"
18:11;18:14;"but right by there, there's some of these gated communities."
18:14;18:16;"That's always a funny vibe when you're in a rich neighborhood"
18:16;18:19;"and then you see the gated community, and you're just like, okay."
18:19;18:21;"Layer upon layer."
18:21;18:24;"Yeah, and there's this one gated community up there that's like--"
18:24;18:26;"I've been in there once or twice."
18:26;18:29;"I'm pretty sure DJ Khaled lives in there, Rod Stewart."
18:29;18:31;"It's just like, you know, true."
18:31;18:33;"Heavy hitters. Heavy hitters."
18:33;18:37;"I remember just being up there, and I'd be eating solo a lot."
18:37;18:39;"You know, because it's that type of thing."
18:39;18:42;"It's not like you're down in Silver Lake."
18:42;18:45;"You just hit a bunch of people up like, oh, you want to come through?"
18:45;18:49;"You're up literally in Asgard. You know what I mean?"
18:49;18:52;"That's an MCU reference."
18:52;18:54;"I didn't actually get it. I just kind of played along."
18:54;18:56;"It's a Thor thing. It's a Thor thing."
18:56;18:57;"Missed it."
18:57;19:00;"So anyway, you're basically up in Asgard."
19:00;19:06;"People can't just jump through the portal very easily to come link up with you."
19:06;19:08;"So I'd be rolling solo to the deli a lot."
19:08;19:10;"You know, I saw all sorts of funny people."
19:10;19:14;"People like really hardcore music industry legends"
19:14;19:16;"that the listeners wouldn't know who they are."
19:16;19:18;"You know, like some old school lawyer that I've heard about."
19:18;19:20;"Just like they're on the phone."
19:20;19:23;"You know, like a bagel. Papers all spread out."
19:23;19:29;"So you'd recognize a legendary music industry lawyer from documentaries?"
19:29;19:33;"A little bit of that and, you know, just being in the game long enough"
19:33;19:37;"that people would point out these types to me."
19:37;19:40;"One time I remember Jon Voight eating solo."
19:40;19:41;"Booth or counter?"
19:41;19:43;"Booth. He was reading some right-wing book."
19:43;19:45;"It was very on the nose."
19:45;19:50;"But anyway, the real part of the story is that I might be eating breakfast there"
19:50;19:53;"three or four times a week over the course of a week."
19:53;19:55;"So you were really regular there for a while."
19:55;19:56;"Yeah, a week here or there."
19:56;19:58;"And these people are super regulars."
19:58;20:03;"So I would say minimum four times, maybe like six or seven times."
20:03;20:06;"A lot of times I saw Brian Wilson come in and eat solo."
20:06;20:08;"He must live near there."
20:08;20:10;"And it was always really interesting because, like, you know, Jon Voight,"
20:10;20:13;"you look at him and you're just like, yeah, that's like a crotchety old dude"
20:13;20:16;"reading his book and having his coffee or whatever."
20:16;20:19;"But Brian Wilson was different because--and I was always so curious about--"
20:19;20:22;"you know, obviously his life is filled with mystery"
20:22;20:24;"and people are like, you know, what's up with him?"
20:24;20:26;"I never saw that."
20:26;20:28;"I saw a movie a few years ago that was like about--"
20:28;20:29;"Love and Mercy."
20:29;20:30;"Love and Mercy. Did you see that?"
20:30;20:31;"Yeah, it was good."
20:31;20:32;"It was good?"
20:32;20:36;"So people say, like, this doctor giving him all sorts of stuff that damaged--"
20:36;20:39;"who knows? Clearly he's had all sorts of struggles in his life."
20:39;20:42;"So he would always come in the door by himself."
20:42;20:44;"But I could tell. I was like, this is a dude who doesn't drive."
20:44;20:45;"So clearly somebody was waiting outside."
20:45;20:46;"He got dropped."
20:46;20:47;"Yeah, he got dropped."
20:47;20:48;"And then he would sit down."
20:48;20:51;"He was such a regular that people would always come up to him and say like,"
20:51;20:54;"""Oh, hey, Brian, how are you doing?"""
20:54;20:55;"And I saw this--"
20:55;20:59;"Like they would talk to him like he was a child sort of?"
20:59;21:00;"Slightly."
21:00;21:02;"Or just talking to like a sweet old person."
21:02;21:05;"But I'm just saying they would go out of their way to be like,"
21:05;21:06;"""Oh, we know you. How are you?"""
21:06;21:07;"Whatever."
21:07;21:09;"And I saw this many times because it's a small place."
21:09;21:13;"It'd be like me, Jon Voight, and Brian Wilson just all sitting solo at the booth."
21:13;21:14;"That's a solid crew."
21:14;21:16;"Yeah, it was a tight crew."
21:16;21:22;"Imagine one day I was just like, ""Guys, every day we're in here sitting together."
21:22;21:23;"We're all in showbiz."
21:23;21:24;"Why don't we sit together?"""
21:24;21:25;"Let's just grab a booth."
21:25;21:27;"Let's just grab a booth."
21:27;21:29;"You guys probably knew each other back in the day."
21:29;21:30;"What's up, man?"
21:30;21:31;"Jon, what are you reading there?"
21:31;21:35;"[laughter]"
21:35;21:37;"So I noticed with Brian Wilson just--"
21:37;21:39;"Yeah, the people would come up and just be like,"
21:39;21:41;"""Oh, hey, Brian, how are you doing today?"""
21:41;21:45;"And just like he would never engage, and he would just go like, ""Breakfast burrito."""
21:45;21:47;"So, you know, obviously a legend."
21:47;21:50;"I was always interested by how often he got a breakfast burrito,"
21:50;21:52;"but, you know, he'd speak kind of loudly."
21:52;21:55;"It was interesting because I see these people kind of go up to him like,"
21:55;21:58;"""Oh, yeah, what's up?"" and you just not really look at them and just always say the thing."
21:58;22:02;"They'd bring it out, scarf it down, in and out in like 12 minutes."
22:02;22:03;"Like you would just crush that burrito."
22:03;22:04;"Yeah."
22:04;22:07;"You know, I don't want to speculate too much on the man's life."
22:07;22:10;"He's a legend, but it certainly got me curious about what does this dude--"
22:10;22:12;"You know, we love day to day."
22:12;22:14;"I was like, ""What is this dude's day to day life?"""
22:14;22:18;"And I guess also the reason that I bring it up is he's been through the ringer in his life,"
22:18;22:22;"so it doesn't shock me that maybe he's in this kind of state of mind where he's just like,"
22:22;22:25;"""You know what? Drop me off. Let me eat my breakfast burrito. No time for niceties."""
22:25;22:26;"Yeah."
22:26;22:28;"Whatever. He's on his own trip. That's not weird."
22:28;22:30;"I think the thing that struck me when I was like,"
22:30;22:33;"""Oh, but he still goes on tour and makes albums and stuff."""
22:33;22:35;"I was like, ""That's interesting."""
22:35;22:38;"Yeah. I mean, I think, like I said at this show,"
22:38;22:43;"I mean, he must have someone that's just like holding his hand the whole step of the way,"
22:43;22:46;"like right till he sits down at the piano."
22:46;22:47;"But he can play piano."
22:47;22:54;"Well, you know how normally on a stage the piano is kind of set sideways so you can see the hands?"
22:54;22:58;"This was just sort of set at a 90 degree angle to the audience."
22:58;22:59;"So you're looking straight at him?"
22:59;23:02;"You're looking at the back of the piano and you're looking at him."
23:02;23:03;"I don't think he was..."
23:03;23:05;"It was truly like... It was sad."
23:05;23:09;"It was truly almost like the final days of a third world dictator."
23:09;23:10;"Like they wheel him out."
23:10;23:11;"Yeah."
23:11;23:14;"And there's like a teleprompter and it's just sort of was like... It was a bummer."
23:14;23:15;"How old is he?"
23:15;23:17;"He's got to be in his 70s."
23:17;23:22;"I guess it's the type of thing where obviously it's like a controversial subject."
23:22;23:26;"You know, there's been a lot of speculation and talk about Richard Simmons."
23:26;23:28;"People believe that he's the victim of elder abuse,"
23:28;23:31;"that maybe he's suffering from dementia or something like that,"
23:31;23:36;"and he's being kind of kept away and alive so that he can sign away some of his fortune"
23:36;23:40;"to family members or people who don't have his best interests at heart."
23:40;23:43;"You know, it's really tricky when people get older and don't have all their faculties."
23:43;23:45;"I mean, maybe Brian's having a great time."
23:45;23:55;"It's very like very raw and like the decline of like every human that is in our future is like fully on stage."
23:55;23:58;"It's not like... But they're playing this like fun, happy music."
23:58;24:03;"There's a guy that's like completely checked out, sitting in the dead center of the stage,"
24:03;24:06;"literally just staring out into the sky."
24:06;24:08;"It's really crazy."
24:08;24:13;"But maybe he's having a great time and he's like, ""I love this music. I love my band."""
24:13;24:15;"Yeah, I guess it's maybe that's the type of thing..."
24:15;24:17;"I don't know what's going on. It's a weird show, though."
24:17;24:21;"Obviously, everybody gets older. You got to deal with different stuff."
24:21;24:24;"There's probably a lot of people who just want to see people."
24:24;24:25;"Yeah."
24:25;24:30;"There's an epidemic of loneliness in this country, as we've discussed way back in the day,"
24:30;24:32;"especially with older people."
24:32;24:36;"And, you know, they might just want to be around people."
24:36;24:40;"And performing at the Greek theater, I wonder."
24:40;24:45;"Yeah, I guess based on what you're describing, and I've never seen him live, I don't think..."
24:45;24:50;"That's the type of thing where you just want to know that even though he might be a little more checked out,"
24:50;24:52;"maybe that happens."
24:52;24:53;"Yeah."
24:53;24:56;"I'm just saying that, yeah, you want to think that somebody like is talking about it with him"
24:56;25:03;"and whatever his demeanor or like if his face doesn't express joy in the way that it did when he was 25,"
25:03;25:07;"that's normal, as long as he's basically like, ""No, this is what I want to do."""
25:07;25:12;"Because if you feel like your life is defined by playing music and performing,"
25:12;25:14;"yeah, because he probably doesn't do interviews anymore, does he?"
25:14;25:15;"I have no idea."
25:15;25:18;"I guess he did an interview in 2016 with Rolling Stone."
25:18;25:20;"I wonder what that interview was, though."
25:20;25:24;"That was like over email with his assistant or that was like actually a sit down."
25:24;25:28;"I have something here from the Palm Springs Desert Sun from August of this year."
25:28;25:29;"An interview?"
25:29;25:35;"With Brian Wilson, yeah, talking about touring with the zombies."
25:35;25:36;"Oh, yeah?"
25:36;25:38;"It's a great night of music, folks."
25:38;25:39;"He's just like, you know--"
25:39;25:41;"Our mortality was just on full display."
25:41;25:47;"I always get some asshole in the crowd who's like, you know, nitpicking my vibe on stage."
25:47;25:48;"Listen, like I'm an old dude."
25:48;25:52;"I can't bring the energy like I used to, but I'm having a ball out there, guys."
25:52;25:53;"I got to be honest."
25:53;25:55;"I'm having the time of my life."
25:55;25:58;"This is from that 2016 article."
25:58;26:02;"A few days earlier, the singer-songwriter and founding Beach Boy celebrated his 74th birthday."
26:02;26:05;"And when the subject comes up, his eyes widen."
26:05;26:08;"It was the greatest birthday of my life, he says, uncrossing his arms."
26:08;26:11;"We went to a place called Peter Luger's."
26:11;26:12;"You got to go there."
26:12;26:13;"You will f*cking love it."
26:13;26:15;"I had the greatest steak dinner that I ever had in my whole life."
26:15;26:16;"He dropped an F-bomb?"
26:16;26:17;"Yeah."
26:17;26:19;"He waits a beat and raises his voice."
26:19;26:21;"In my whole life."
26:21;26:23;"Maybe he just lives for food and music now."
26:23;26:26;"Loving those steaks, loving those breakfast burritos."
26:26;26:27;"You know what?"
26:27;26:28;"I think..."
26:28;26:29;"Loving the late 60s Beach Boy stuff."
26:29;26:31;"Yeah, I bet he's chilling."
26:31;26:33;"Al Jardine was on stage with them."
26:33;26:34;"Oh, that's tight."
26:34;26:38;"It was funny because like, yeah, they were playing stuff off like Smile and..."
26:38;26:40;"Because yeah, they did Heroes and Villains and they were doing stuff off Surf's Up."
26:40;26:45;"And that's like George Gershwin level sophisticated composition."
26:45;26:47;"And then it'd be like, now we're doing an Al Jardine song."
26:47;26:50;"And it's just like, I can't remember what they were."
26:50;26:54;"But it's just like the funniest, just like garage rock, bar band garage rock."
26:54;26:56;"Between those guys..."
26:56;26:59;"Going down to the beach and doing their stuff."
26:59;27:03;"And I was like, that's like really kind of an old school band vibe."
27:03;27:04;"Yeah."
27:04;27:06;"Like there's like one or two geniuses."
27:06;27:08;"And then there's like another guy or two that also write songs."
27:08;27:11;"Well, that was like a recurring joke in Bohemian Rhapsody."
27:11;27:15;"They would always kind of razz the drummer because they'd be like,"
27:15;27:18;"single from this album, it's got to be Bohemian Rhapsody."
27:18;27:20;"It's like, it's opera."
27:20;27:22;"It's our most ambitious work yet."
27:22;27:26;"And then the joke in the movies, he's always like, what about my song, I Love My Car?"
27:26;27:29;"I don't know if that was like reflective of the actual dynamic in the band."
27:29;27:33;"But they made that a joke that it was like Brian May and like obviously Freddie Mercury."
27:33;27:35;"Just like this very sophisticated stuff."
27:35;27:37;"And it's just like, I love my car."
27:37;27:39;"It's a good rock tune, man."
27:39;27:41;"Well, anyway, shout out to Brian Wilson."
27:41;27:42;"I bet he's chilling."
27:42;27:45;"I've been in this town so long that back in the city"
27:45;27:52;"I've been taken for lost and gone and unknown for a long, long time."
27:52;27:56;"Well, in love years ago with an innocent girl"
27:56;28:04;"from the Spanish and Indian home of the heroes and villains."
28:04;28:09;"Once a night the tapes ran dry and she was riding in the rain"
28:09;28:14;"of the folks that eventually brought her down."
28:14;28:17;"But she's still dancing in the night anyway"
28:17;28:22;"of what a hero would do in a town full of heroes and villains."
28:29;28:37;"Heroes and villains, just see what you've done."
29:01;29:07;"Heroes and villains, just see what you've done."
29:07;29:09;"I mean, we've been following this story for a long time."
29:09;29:11;"I don't know if we've talked about it that much on air,"
29:11;29:15;"but I got a lot of texts, got a lot of emails from people"
29:15;29:18;"when the news broke to the mainstream"
29:18;29:21;"that the Richard Montanez biopic is happening."
29:21;29:25;"I feel like we willed this into existence."
29:25;29:27;"I kind of feel that way."
29:27;29:30;"Tom Christmas is very influential."
29:30;29:33;"By the way, you see how many people have been covering"
29:33;29:35;"Winter's Starbucks lately?"
29:35;29:37;"Yeah, it's crazy."
29:37;29:40;"BBC, Fox News, CNN."
29:40;29:42;"Seth Meyers."
29:42;29:43;"Oh, Seth Meyers?"
29:43;29:44;"Yeah."
29:44;29:45;"What, did he do a joke about it?"
29:45;29:47;"Yeah, he kind of ripped on Winter, but I think Winter was down."
29:47;29:51;"Oh, no, the joke was a man's mission to visit every Starbucks in the world."
29:51;29:54;"He finally reaches 15,000 Starbucks, and they finally spelled his name"
29:54;29:58;"right on his cup, and it's cut to this cup, and it said ""Dork."""
29:58;30:01;"And Winter was like, ""Oh, man, but you know what?"
30:01;30:04;"Respect coming from Seth Meyers,"" or something like that."
30:04;30:05;"And then like--"
30:05;30:06;"Not cool, Seth."
30:06;30:08;"Yeah, it's like, ""Seth, come on, bro."""
30:08;30:11;"Yeah, [bleep] you."
30:11;30:12;"Seinfeld."
30:12;30:13;"Real talk."
30:13;30:14;"Seinfeld is going hard on--"
30:14;30:16;"Cutting through all the noise with that one."
30:16;30:19;"Should we try to get Seth Meyers on the show, hash this out?"
30:19;30:20;"I would love that."
30:20;30:23;"Yeah, let's see Seth Meyers around here and there."
30:23;30:26;"Yeah, I think I could get his email very quickly."
30:26;30:30;"I'd like say, ""Hey, man, so we'd love it if you'd come on."""
30:30;30:32;"He would just be like--"
30:32;30:34;"I bet he literally wouldn't know what we were talking about."
30:34;30:36;"Yeah, he just read that joke."
30:36;30:40;"Yeah, like I do 20 of those jokes a night."
30:40;30:42;"What the [bleep] are you talking about?"
30:42;30:45;"He's a friend-- because we do a show, and Winter's like a kind of character"
30:45;30:46;"on our show."
30:46;30:48;"You do a show, we do a show."
30:48;30:50;"You got your kind of guys."
30:50;30:51;"We got our guys."
30:51;30:52;"Winter's one of our guys, man."
30:52;30:55;"We just-- it didn't sit right with us."
30:55;30:58;"She's like, ""I have no idea."""
30:58;31:00;"The Starbucks joke."
31:00;31:02;"Which Starbucks joke?"
31:02;31:04;"Obviously, Winter deserves all the credit."
31:04;31:06;"He's the one who went to 15,000 Starbucks."
31:06;31:12;"All I'm saying is that time crisis, we've been covering him since 2017"
31:12;31:16;"because we tell the stories that matter first."
31:16;31:21;"One question is I wonder if any of those outlets did pick up on the story"
31:21;31:26;"via time crisis, chose not to give us credit."
31:26;31:29;"Some, like, intern in the writer's room."
31:29;31:30;"The TC head?"
31:30;31:33;"It was like, ""Hey, I got an idea."""
31:33;31:34;"Who knows?"
31:34;31:35;"But whatever."
31:35;31:36;"Winter deserves the credit for all the press."
31:36;31:42;"All I'm saying is, as usual, we beat the lamestream media by years."
31:42;31:45;"Well, Winter blasted out a press release."
31:45;31:47;"Remember he was asking for our notes on it?"
31:47;31:48;"No, I missed that."
31:48;31:50;"I missed that email."
31:50;31:55;"I missed an email being like, ""Hey, what are your thoughts on this press release?"""
31:55;31:56;"When was this?"
31:56;31:58;"Like a month ago."
31:58;31:59;"Totally missed that."
31:59;32:00;"Oops."
32:00;32:03;"All right, we found one article that loops us in."
32:03;32:05;"Very self-indulgent part of the show."
32:05;32:10;"Looking for articles on the internet that reference our own show."
32:10;32:14;"For the last 22 years, Winter has been the subject of many people's fascination."
32:14;32:18;"In 2006, he was the star of a documentary called Starbucking by Bill Tangerman."
32:18;32:19;"We've got to watch that."
32:19;32:24;"I guess there was a full documentary a decade before we were on it, so we don't deserve too much credit."
32:24;32:27;"Well, my first communication with him goes back to '03."
32:27;32:28;"Okay."
32:28;32:29;"Emailed in '03."
32:29;32:34;"It's funny, because the next line of this, ""News outlets have written articles about him since as early as 2002."""
32:34;32:35;"Oh, okay."
32:35;32:37;"Well, somehow I found him, so."
32:37;32:42;"A headline in the Palm Beach Post from 2007 reads, ""Is he off his bean?"""
32:42;32:44;"Off his bean?"
32:44;32:45;"Disrespectful."
32:45;32:46;"F*** you, Palm Beach Post."
32:46;32:48;"Is that an expression?"
32:48;32:51;"It's like, ""Off your rocker."""
32:51;32:54;"Well, definitely your bean referred to as your head is a thing."
32:54;32:55;"Sure."
32:55;32:56;"And recently he's been--"
32:56;32:57;"Don't push in it with that palm."
32:57;32:58;"Yeah, right?"
32:58;33:05;"Recently he's been featured a few times on the podcast, ""Time Crisis,"" hosted by Vampire Weekend frontman Ezra Kanick."
33:05;33:06;"Okay, we need--"
33:06;33:07;"And American painter."
33:07;33:10;"Yeah, what about American painter radio personality?"
33:10;33:12;"[Laughter]"
33:12;33:17;"As well as Twitter celebrity Seinfeld 2000."
33:17;33:18;"Influencer."
33:18;33:20;"Influencer, sorry, wrong term."
33:20;33:26;"I'm an American musician and radio personality, Jake's an American painter and music personality."
33:26;33:31;"Seinfeld is a Canadian influencer and radio personality."
33:31;33:33;"Would it be Canadian-American or just Canadian?"
33:33;33:34;"Just Canadian."
33:34;33:35;"Wait, are you Canadian-American?"
33:35;33:36;"No."
33:36;33:38;"I mean, you live in America, so it's like--"
33:38;33:39;"Yeah, you're allowed to."
33:39;33:40;"I feel American."
33:40;33:44;"Don't buy into, like, outdated notions of citizenship, man."
33:44;33:46;"Can we say North American?"
33:46;33:47;"Too vague."
33:47;33:49;"North American influencer."
33:49;33:55;"Oh, but you know, by the way, speaking of-- before we dive back into the Montaneas, you know I met Patrick World in Montreal?"
33:55;33:56;"Oh, yeah!"
33:56;33:57;"Yeah."
33:57;34:06;"Yeah, he DMed us, and yeah, I put him in touch with your management, and I'm glad you guys had a chance to meet."
34:06;34:07;"Shout out to Patrick World."
34:07;34:15;"It was tight because two people from my high school, Pete and Celia, a couple from my town, Glen Ridge,"
34:15;34:16;"they're married now and they live in Vermont."
34:16;34:18;"Are they a TC couple?"
34:18;34:28;"I don't remember if they said they listen to TC, but they came to see Vampire Weekend, and people from Vermont go see shows in Montreal a lot."
34:28;34:29;"Yeah, close to city."
34:29;34:30;"That can be their closest city."
34:30;34:33;"Oh, yeah, we used to drive down, do some cross-border shopping, and then we saw--"
34:33;34:34;"In Vermont?"
34:34;34:37;"Yeah, we saw Louis Guzman once at Sweetwater when I was a kid."
34:37;34:38;"In Vermont?"
34:38;34:39;"Yeah."
34:39;34:41;"In, like, Montpelier or what city?"
34:41;34:42;"Burlington."
34:42;34:43;"Okay."
34:43;34:46;"So there's a nice cultural exchange between Burlington and Montreal."
34:46;34:51;"Yeah, actually, Luis, who we knew from doing stuff for Bernie Sanders, came up too."
34:51;34:52;"Oh, yeah."
34:52;34:53;"A little Burlington crew."
34:53;34:58;"And it was good to see them and just kind of catch up on our hometown and stuff."
34:58;35:06;"But it's funny, you're backstage, and you see a bunch of people who are at the show, so you talk to some people, and somebody comes up, and you're like, ""Oh, hey."""
35:06;35:15;"I guess this could happen at any type of gathering or party, but specifically at aftershows sometimes, especially if we have a part-weekend aftershow, it could be the
most random mix of people."
35:15;35:19;"So suddenly, two people you're just talking to, they're kind of sitting there waiting."
35:19;35:28;"So I'm just like, ""Then that happened, and I'm talking to Patrick, and he's telling me we're catching up, and I'm thanking him for all the great work he's done for the
show and for supporting us."""
35:28;35:29;"And he's telling me more about his background."
35:29;35:31;"He actually has a bit of a radio background."
35:31;35:32;"Oh, okay."
35:32;35:33;"That was cool."
35:33;35:35;"Oh, one thing also he confirmed, he doesn't make the tracks."
35:35;35:40;"Okay, he's not doing live drums on his cover of Boyz R Back in Town."
35:40;35:41;"Oh, wow."
35:41;35:42;"Which makes sense."
35:42;35:43;"I'm like Weird Al Yankovic."
35:43;35:45;"Does Al build from the ground up?"
35:45;35:47;"Al builds everything from the ground up."
35:47;35:48;"He must."
35:48;35:49;"Yeah, recreates everything."
35:49;35:51;"Yeah, but we can't expect."
35:51;35:56;"It's one of those funny things where I turn to them and say, ""Oh, hey, guys. By the way, this is Patrick."""
35:56;35:57;"I'm like, ""Hey."""
35:57;36:00;"And I was like, ""So, yeah, in fact, I don't think they're TCS."""
36:00;36:01;"That's a lot of backstory."
36:01;36:03;"I was like, ""You know I do this radio show,"" and they're like, ""Oh, okay."""
36:03;36:11;"And I was like, ""So on the radio show, Patrick, I've never met him before, but he's a listener who will send us in parodies, songs based on..."""
36:11;36:13;"And they're just kind of like, ""Okay."""
36:13;36:16;"Yeah, a lot of inside jokes from our show."
36:16;36:20;"You know, Lonnie's dad, Lord Hadaway, things of that nature."
36:20;36:23;"They look around and Patrick's nowhere to be seen."
36:23;36:24;"No, I swear he was--"
36:24;36:26;"Yeah, he was just there."
36:26;36:29;"No, but shout out to Patrick and his wife who came through."
36:29;36:35;"Wow, it sounds like the East Coast is really like some big TC icons were in the mix."
36:35;36:42;"Well, and then there was a Twitter exchange later where Winter and Patrick were making plans to link up."
36:42;36:43;"Did you see that?"
36:43;36:45;"Oh, actually, I did. That is sick."
36:45;36:46;"That's tight."
36:46;36:49;"The TC world is-- it's really a family."
36:49;36:56;"You know, the next step would be people starting to date, like TC fan community."
36:56;37:02;"It's like, ""Hey, anyone else a TC head? I'm looking to meet someone."""
37:02;37:09;"Wait, I told you how a while ago I got a bunch of old issues of Relics on eBay, like some '80s Relics."
37:09;37:10;"Wow."
37:10;37:13;"So, you know, Relics still exists. It's a great news source."
37:13;37:16;"They did a big Vampire Weekend cover story this year."
37:16;37:17;"I got to check that out."
37:17;37:18;"Yeah, it was tight."
37:18;37:24;"Yeah, I love talking to the journalist who also wrote or co-wrote Bill Kreutzman's memoirs."
37:24;37:25;"Oh, that's sick."
37:25;37:32;"But I remember looking through one of them, and there were, you know, like wan ads and personals in the back."
37:32;37:38;"And they're literally-- I know this sounds like so kooky, but I wish I could say verbatim, but I remember seeing some--"
37:38;37:42;"so it might be everything from people being like looking to trade tapes, that kind of stuff."
37:42;37:50;"But then I remember seeing some personal ads, and I remember they were like-- some were so hyper-specific, just like looking for ladies who are also deadheads."
37:50;37:52;"And, like, some of them were so hyper-specific."
37:52;38:02;"I remember a guy who's like looking for, like, a deadhead lady, you know, age, whatever, somebody who leans towards pre-'72 stuff."
38:02;38:03;"That's important to me."
38:03;38:05;"It was, like, literally like that kind of thing."
38:05;38:07;"It's so deep."
38:07;38:13;"I guess it's also possible that if this was the '80s-- I can't remember when this issue was."
38:13;38:15;"Maybe he just wanted to make sure he wasn't getting a touch head."
38:15;38:16;"Sure, sure."
38:16;38:20;"Which are people who got on board with their breakout single ""Touch of Gray."""
38:20;38:21;"In '87."
38:21;38:24;"So, like, what years were these magazines you were buying?"
38:24;38:25;"Some of them were from the '80s."
38:25;38:26;"Like late '80s, early '90s?"
38:26;38:27;"I'll bring some in."
38:27;38:30;"Why did you get them? Just out of curiosity?"
38:30;38:32;"I mean, I've always been interested in relics."
38:32;38:34;"It's like a magazine I would see around, but not '80s relics."
38:34;38:37;"I would see it at best for me maybe in the late '90s."
38:37;38:43;"And I think I would see-- I would just see, like, cool people, like some cool deadhead t-shirt people, like post-relics."
38:43;38:46;"And I would see them post, like, their collection of vintage ones."
38:46;38:50;"I was like, ""Ooh, I want to see what's inside that 1985 relic."""
38:50;38:51;"That is so deep."
38:51;38:53;"So I bought, like, three or four."
38:53;38:54;"That's cool."
38:54;38:55;"That I got for, like, decent prices."
38:55;38:56;"Yeah."
38:56;38:57;"Are they expensive, sort of?"
38:57;38:59;"I didn't find any, like, dirt cheap."
38:59;39:00;"I got 100 relics."
39:00;39:03;"Hey, if you take them off my hands for $10, I'm happy."
39:03;39:07;"No, it's more like, you know, probably some of them cost, like, $10."
39:07;39:08;"Okay, yeah."
39:08;39:11;"It wasn't like-- Yeah, I wasn't dropping, like, $150 for a pristine copy."
39:11;39:13;"But, you know, like--"
39:13;39:14;"Near mint."
39:14;39:15;"Yeah."
39:15;39:17;"But I'll bring them in because they're fascinating."
39:17;39:23;"And also there's something nice about-- at that era, it's like in between a zine and a professional magazine."
39:23;39:26;"There's, like, a handmade quality to some of the stuff inside."
39:26;39:30;"But I also just, like, love thinking about this dude, just, like, mid-'80s."
39:30;39:34;"Like, at first, I wonder what kind of responses he got."
39:34;39:37;"And I'm also picturing somebody just like, ""Hey, man, like, you know what?"
39:37;39:42;"I also live in Westchester, and I happen to see that I've been looking to meet a Deadhead, too."""
39:42;39:47;"And then, like, they link up, and he's just, like, immediately just, like, full douchebag, just, like, quizzing her."
39:47;39:48;"Just like--"
39:48;39:50;"""So '74, how do you feel?"""
39:50;39:51;"Yeah."
39:51;39:53;"Okay."
39:53;39:56;"What's the best Mr. Charlie of '72?"
39:56;39:59;"And you can't say the one on Europe '72."
39:59;40:00;"And she's like, ""I don't know, man."
40:00;40:03;"I like-- I like Touch of Grey."
40:03;40:04;"I like Uncle John's Man."""
40:04;40:06;"He's just like, ""Get the f--- out of here."""
40:06;40:09;"""This is not going to work."""
40:09;40:10;"""I'm looking for happiness."
40:10;40:11;"Can't you tell?"""
40:11;40:12;"Yeah."
40:12;40:16;"She's just, like, beautiful, hippie chick."
40:16;40:19;"Yeah, just somewhat familiar."
40:19;40:20;"""Oh, no, I haven't heard that."
40:20;40:24;"No, I'd love to learn more about some of, like, the '74 bootlegs."""
40:24;40:28;"And he's like, ""Well, get back to me when you do."""
40:28;40:30;"""You wasted both of our time."""
40:30;40:34;"Anyway, the TC personals wouldn't be like that."
40:34;40:35;"Colin just showed me something."
40:35;40:36;"Where was it?"
40:36;40:37;"It was on Reddit."
40:37;40:38;"Wait, is it on the TC Reddit?"
40:38;40:40;"The TC Reddit, which I never look at, but--"
40:40;40:42;"Oh, yeah, is the TC Reddit popping?"
40:42;40:43;"Oh, nice."
40:43;40:46;"Subject had New York-based TC heads."
40:46;40:49;"""Hey, I'm visiting New York for work October 6 to 8"
40:49;40:52;"and wondering if any TC heads wanted to get a drink."
40:52;40:54;"I'm 25, into corporate food history, jam bands,"
40:54;40:56;"and visiting Starbucks."""
40:56;40:58;"Response, ""Suburban New Yorker here."
40:58;41:00;"Let's get a coffee."""
41:00;41:01;"Oh, that's sick."
41:01;41:02;"That's sweet."
41:02;41:05;"Wait, what--it was a 25-year-old man?"
41:05;41:06;"Oh, that's cool."
41:06;41:07;"Yeah, there's no--"
41:07;41:08;"It's kind of post-gender, just like--"
41:08;41:10;"This is about the show."
41:10;41:12;"Oh, this is just about linking up."
41:12;41:15;"Yeah, it's not a dating inquiry."
41:15;41:17;"Yeah, you know, maybe that's better, too."
41:17;41:20;"It's like people bring too much energy and expectation"
41:20;41:21;"to romantic relationships."
41:21;41:23;"Well, that's how something could really happen, though."
41:23;41:25;"It's like two TC heads."
41:25;41:28;"They're just there to talk about the show, maybe connect."
41:28;41:30;"And then, you know, one thing leads to another, maybe."
41:30;41:31;"Right."
41:31;41:33;"And then, when, like, hey, we're just talking about the show,"
41:33;41:34;"no presh."
41:34;41:36;"Yeah, it's just a meetup."
41:36;41:38;"There was one time earlier this year,"
41:38;41:40;"I believe it was after our Cincinnati show,"
41:40;41:45;"a young woman DMed me on Instagram and said, like,"
41:45;41:49;"""Listen, I was sitting next to this guy at the show,"
41:49;41:51;"and we really hit it off, and we were talking about"
41:51;41:53;"this, this, and this."""
41:53;41:54;"Yeah, we had good sense--"
41:54;41:56;"They might have been TC heads."
41:56;41:57;"I don't remember, but they were like--"
41:57;41:59;"We were, like, joking around."
41:59;42:01;"""I'm a medical student at the University of Cincinnati,"
42:01;42:02;"blah, blah, blah."
42:02;42:04;"I really regret that I didn't ask for his number."
42:04;42:06;"I was, like, being too shy or something."
42:06;42:07;"Can you help me out?"""
42:07;42:10;"And then I was like, ""I mean, I guess."""
42:10;42:11;"Yeah, what do you do?"
42:11;42:15;"I was like, ""If you can, like, condense this into one post,"
42:15;42:18;"I'll throw it on my IG stories."""
42:18;42:21;"So she made, like, a pretty well-designed little, like,"
42:21;42:22;"""Hey, what's up?"""
42:22;42:24;"You know, she was using, like, Futura and stuff."
42:24;42:26;"Yeah, Miss Connection, Cincinnati show."
42:26;42:28;"And I posted it, and I got a lot of response."
42:28;42:29;"It was really sweet."
42:29;42:31;"I would feel like, in this day and age,"
42:31;42:34;"somebody--it wouldn't be that hard to figure out."
42:34;42:36;"I wonder if they ever linked up."
42:36;42:37;"Yeah."
42:37;42:39;"Kind of feel like if they had,"
42:39;42:41;"then you would have gotten, like, a follow-up from her."
42:41;42:43;"A wedding invitation."
42:43;42:44;"But I agree."
42:44;42:45;"Whatever. Romantic relationships."
42:45;42:46;"I was expecting."
42:46;42:47;"[laughter]"
42:47;42:49;"TC, baby."
42:49;42:50;"I'm just going deep on the subreddit."
42:50;42:53;"Did you know that during the Apple iPhone release,"
42:53;42:55;"there was an Apple Watch video"
42:55;42:58;"with a VO by Michael Cera with ""Sympathy"" as the backing?"
42:58;42:59;"Oh, yeah, of course."
42:59;43:01;"Wild. I missed that."
43:01;43:03;"Yeah, unrelated to time crisis."
43:03;43:05;"I got--there was, like, some message on Twitter that was like,"
43:05;43:07;"""Is that part of your time crisis deal?"""
43:07;43:09;"And I was like, ""How dare you?"""
43:09;43:11;"[laughter]"
43:11;43:14;"These are independent branches of the organization."
43:14;43:17;"Yeah, ""Sympathy"" is in an Apple Watch commercial."
43:17;43:18;"That's so modern."
43:18;43:20;"I haven't seen it in full."
43:20;43:21;"And I didn't know that Michael Cera"
43:21;43:24;"was going to do the voiceover, but that's tight."
43:24;43:26;"Yeah, I think it premiered at the keynote,"
43:26;43:28;"but I don't know if it's on TV yet."
43:28;43:30;"Yeah, I can't find it anywhere."
43:30;43:31;"Anyway, check it out."
43:31;43:33;"Seinfeld's down the rabbit hole in that Reddit."
43:33;43:35;"Yeah, I got to close this window."
43:35;43:37;"Yeah, I can see, like, your eyes are glazing over."
43:37;43:39;"You need to get out of there."
43:39;43:42;"Reddit--that's the Reddit, you know, it just sucks you in."
43:42;43:44;"Suddenly it's nighttime."
43:44;43:45;"You're just on Reddit all day."
43:45;43:48;"Master thread for determining Seinfeld 2000's address."
43:48;43:52;"[laughter]"
43:52;43:56;"Um, I wonder if there's any, like, TC loyalists"
43:56;43:58;"who, like, still see you as a villain."
43:58;44:00;"'Cause when you first came on the show,"
44:00;44:03;"you were definitely a bit of a villain."
44:03;44:05;"Yeah, people are confused by that narrative."
44:05;44:08;"What, that's, like, that's one of the most classic narratives"
44:08;44:10;"of all time--foe becomes friend?"
44:10;44:11;"It's true."
44:11;44:13;"It was a character evolution."
44:13;44:16;"It was some pro wrestling [bleep]"
44:16;44:17;"That's right."
44:17;44:19;"Eventually, though, there's going to be the fallout."
44:19;44:21;"There could be the fallout."
44:21;44:22;"Seinfeld gets banished."
44:22;44:26;"Yeah, we should create more storylines for this show."
44:26;44:28;"We just bring in just, like, some real--"
44:28;44:30;"just some real dweeb who's just, like,"
44:30;44:32;"world's biggest Friends fan."
44:32;44:34;"[laughter]"
44:34;44:37;"I am interested in hearing about how the Rembrandts"
44:37;44:39;"feel about the 25th anniversary of Friends,"
44:39;44:41;"which is now, right?"
44:41;44:44;"Anyway, why am I--why am I talking about this?"
44:44;44:45;"You're kind of excited."
44:45;44:49;"I mean, at a certain point, old rivalries,"
44:49;44:50;"they kind of collapse."
44:50;44:52;"You know, it's kind of like when you're talking about,"
44:52;44:55;"like, imagine two 85-year-olds"
44:55;44:58;"fought on opposing sides of a war."
44:58;44:59;"They both make it to 85."
44:59;45:01;"They're sitting at a cafe."
45:01;45:04;"They've both seen the way that time ravages everybody--"
45:04;45:07;"the winners, the losers."
45:07;45:09;"They both have lost so many people."
45:09;45:11;"They're both the last men standing from their platoon."
45:11;45:14;"They look at each other, former enemies,"
45:14;45:15;"and they're just kind of like,"
45:15;45:18;"""Hey, man, let me buy you that cup of coffee."
45:18;45:20;"I hated your guts. I want to kill you."""
45:20;45:22;"But now we're--I mean, it's real sh--."
45:22;45:23;"Actually, it's very moving."
45:23;45:27;"I've spoken highly of the Ken Burns Vietnam doc."
45:27;45:29;"You ever crack that, Jake?"
45:29;45:30;"Didn't get through it."
45:30;45:31;"It's awesome."
45:31;45:32;"The beginning's tough."
45:32;45:34;"The beginning's tough."
45:34;45:35;"That's on me."
45:35;45:37;"It's a major investment in the beginning,"
45:37;45:39;"but when you get to the end, they talk, too,"
45:39;45:44;"about, like, a lot of these American soldiers"
45:44;45:46;"who were so young, you know?"
45:46;45:48;"These were very young adults when they rolled over there."
45:48;45:50;"Some of them who probably drank the Kool-Aid"
45:50;45:53;"or believed they were fighting a necessary battle"
45:53;45:55;"have a lot of questions later,"
45:55;45:57;"and they talk about how some of these dudes"
45:57;45:59;"roll back to Vietnam just like--"
45:59;46:00;"it's haunted them their whole lives,"
46:00;46:02;"you know, PTSD, whatever."
46:02;46:04;"And they talk about that there's, like--"
46:04;46:06;"a not uncommon thing is that, like,"
46:06;46:09;"Northern Vietnamese soldiers and North Vietnamese won,"
46:09;46:11;"so the whole country is--"
46:11;46:13;"they're returning to the country"
46:13;46:15;"where the victors beat the U.S."
46:15;46:18;"And now some of these American soldiers"
46:18;46:19;"will go kind of, like, link up with dudes"
46:19;46:21;"who are on the opposing side,"
46:21;46:22;"and there is this, like, weird--"
46:22;46:24;"- Wow. - Shared camaraderie"
46:24;46:25;"of kind of, like--"
46:25;46:27;"I don't think the Northern Vietnamese soldiers"
46:27;46:28;"are like, ""You know what, man?"""
46:28;46:30;"- ""Water under the bridge."" - ""Water under the bridge."""
46:30;46:32;"You know, U.S. imperialism, capitalism,"
46:32;46:34;"it's all the same. - It's all good, man."
46:34;46:35;"- But I do think there is some--"
46:35;46:37;"that there is some weird shared thing"
46:37;46:38;"where they're just kind of like,"
46:38;46:40;"""We were both on-the-ground soldiers"
46:40;46:41;"""in a larger thing."
46:41;46:42;"""I don't hate you."
46:42;46:44;"""We both shared a traumatic experience."
46:44;46:47;"""Probably not forgiving the U.S. as an entity."""
46:47;46:50;"- Oh, yeah, like, we were both cannon fodder."
46:50;46:52;"- Yeah, and even some of these guys"
46:52;46:54;"probably, like, realizing the way that"
46:54;46:56;"their worldview was morphed by the--"
46:56;46:57;"you know, so anyway,"
46:57;46:58;"it's like this kind of moving thing"
46:58;46:59;"where, like, some of these dudes"
46:59;47:02;"who probably wouldn't have dreamed of it,"
47:02;47:03;"you know, are there,"
47:03;47:04;"and it feels, like, cathartic to them"
47:04;47:08;"to be like, ""We were both victims of violence."""
47:08;47:11;"Actually, now I just remember what we were talking about."
47:11;47:14;"- Yeah, this is me defending--"
47:14;47:15;"- This is like a bad TC rabbit hole"
47:15;47:17;"where I actually jumped to something way too deep,"
47:17;47:19;"and now it's actually insulting to go back"
47:19;47:21;"to what we were originally talking about,"
47:21;47:23;"which is friends versus Seinfeld."
47:23;47:24;"Oops."
47:24;47:27;"Apologies, but I'm saying that, you know,"
47:27;47:28;"I think time collapses everything,"
47:28;47:30;"and when I picture, like, the old heads--"
47:30;47:34;"I've given this example before in Keith Richards' book,"
47:34;47:37;"how he talks about he and Paul McCartney"
47:37;47:39;"staying on the same Caribbean island,"
47:39;47:41;"like, staying in two villas next to each other,"
47:41;47:43;"and just kind of, like, hitting him up,"
47:43;47:45;"just like, ""Yo, man, you want to, like, go for a walk?"""
47:45;47:47;"And he's like, ""Me and Paul just walked on the beach,"
47:47;47:49;"and we just talked about the old days, man."""
47:49;47:52;"And obviously, the Beatles versus the Stones"
47:52;47:54;"is not the same intensity as--"
47:54;47:55;"- Friends versus Seinfeld."
47:55;47:56;"- Friends versus Seinfeld,"
47:56;47:59;"let alone North Vietnam versus the U.S.,"
47:59;48:03;"but the way he talked about it was kind of just like,"
48:03;48:05;"""We used to be competitive."""
48:05;48:06;"I don't know if he quite says it,"
48:06;48:08;"but you can imagine Keith Richards probably thought,"
48:08;48:10;"McCartney was a bit of a cornball."
48:10;48:11;"- Mm-hmm."
48:11;48:13;"- Keith Richards was the badass of the badass crew,"
48:13;48:15;"and Paul McCartney was kind of, like,"
48:15;48:17;"the sweetheart of, like, the sweet crew,"
48:17;48:18;"so, you know, they're--"
48:18;48:20;"in many ways, they're diametric opposites."
48:20;48:23;"But the way he frames it is a little bit just like,"
48:23;48:27;"""Yeah, two grizzled soldiers, we're both still standing,"
48:27;48:29;"and actually, we have more in common with each other"
48:29;48:30;"because we remember."
48:30;48:34;"We remember the past. We've seen good men die."
48:34;48:37;"John Lennon, George Harrison,"
48:37;48:38;"Brian Jones."""
48:38;48:39;"So there's, like, this slight--"
48:39;48:40;"- Mm-hmm."
48:40;48:42;"- Actually, I should go back to that passage."
48:42;48:44;"I wonder if he uses any soldier imagery."
48:44;48:46;"But we had this feeling of just kind of, like,"
48:46;48:48;"the fact that we're both still standing"
48:48;48:51;"and that we both even remember this battle"
48:51;48:52;"or this time period"
48:52;48:54;"unites us in a way that even, like,"
48:54;48:57;"our children couldn't understand."
48:57;48:59;"So anyway, I think that's starting to happen"
48:59;49:00;"with Seinfeld 2000, where--"
49:00;49:01;"- No, no, no."
49:01;49:03;"- You've been fighting this battle for so long"
49:03;49:04;"that one day--"
49:04;49:06;"and, look, now you even see, like,"
49:06;49:08;"""Friends"" is getting canceled."
49:08;49:09;"- No--what?"
49:09;49:11;"- ""Friends"" is the most popular show on Netflix."
49:11;49:13;"I just thought there was some kind of clickbait article"
49:13;49:15;"that was, like, why ""Friends"" is actually trash."
49:15;49:17;"- Yeah, it's been-- there's been a backlash."
49:17;49:20;"A lot of think pieces about the 25th anniversary"
49:20;49:22;"and how, you know, we're rethinking ""Friends"""
49:22;49:23;"and all the rest of it."
49:23;49:24;"I mean, we all already--"
49:24;49:26;"a lot of us knew that ""Friends"" was trash"
49:26;49:27;"from the jump."
49:27;49:29;"- Yeah, but people do that with ""Seinfeld"" too."
49:29;49:30;"- Well, no, they don't at all."
49:30;49:31;"- ""Seinfeld"" got more heat earlier,"
49:31;49:33;"maybe because ""Seinfeld""--"
49:33;49:35;"""Seinfeld"" was a bigger target, maybe,"
49:35;49:38;"because it actually existed in this more intelligent circle."
49:38;49:40;"- Why did people say ""Seinfeld"" was trash?"
49:40;49:42;"- I just think, like, to some people,"
49:42;49:44;"represent, like--well, people talked about, like,"
49:44;49:46;"""Seinfeld"" being very white."
49:46;49:47;"- Yeah, that's true."
49:47;49:49;"Yeah, and it's--you know, Larry David"
49:49;49:52;"references it a lot on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"""
49:52;49:53;"and--anyway."

50:14;50:16;"- I just think--no, you're not there yet,"
50:16;50:17;"but I'm picturing, like, in 20 years."

52:22;52:24;"and it was just a note from him,"
52:24;52:26;"and I think we've also been trying to go through--"
52:26;52:28;"- But did you say it was time crisis with Ezra and Jake?"
52:28;52:30;"- Yeah, I led with-- I did the whole thing."
52:30;52:32;"I said, you know, you can-- - But did you start out saying,"
52:32;52:33;"""Hey, I'm Seinfeld 2000."""
52:33;52:34;"Maybe they were just like, ""Eh."""
52:34;52:37;"- No, no, no, I did it, like, as my real--"
52:37;52:38;"like, I used my real name."
52:38;52:40;"- He's probably like, ""Oh, yeah, Seinfeld 2000."
52:40;52:42;"I don't like that guy."" - No, no, no, everybody loves--"
52:42;52:44;"- He caused a lot of trouble in the early days of TC."
52:44;52:46;"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
52:46;52:48;"It's a beloved-- it's a beloved internet presence"
52:48;52:52;"that really everybody wants to be tapped into."
52:52;52:54;"But, uh, no, he--"
52:54;52:57;"I think that he was actually just saving the IP"
52:57;52:59;"for this film. That's my theory."
52:59;53:01;"He's like, ""I'm not gonna do interviews."
53:01;53:02;"I'm not gonna do press."
53:02;53:05;"Let's have Eva Longoria handle this story with the tender."""
53:05;53:07;"- Or to be fair, to be fair, maybe he's like--"
53:07;53:10;"he gets paid to fly around the world to tell his story."
53:10;53:11;"He goes to colleges."
53:11;53:14;"He gives kind of inspirational talks at corporations."
53:14;53:18;"Maybe his vibe is like, ""I don't need to do press per se."
53:18;53:21;"I'm out there telling my story, and I'm being rewarded for it."""
53:21;53:24;"So I could imagine, you know, he's talking at a college"
53:24;53:26;"or something, he's getting his speaker's fee,"
53:26;53:29;"and we're like, ""You want to just come do some press?"""
53:29;53:30;"He's like, ""Why?"""
53:30;53:33;"- Right, yeah, and I think he knows that you're kind of like,"
53:33;53:36;"uh, I don't know, like, maybe you'll make fun of him."
53:36;53:38;"Like, maybe this isn't a safe space for--"
53:38;53:39;"- I don't make fun of people."
53:39;53:41;"- Well, not make fun of-- but he knows that you're like--"
53:41;53:45;"- He knows that I associate with people like a Seinfeld 2000,"
53:45;53:48;"kind of mean-spirited, kind of snarky."
53:48;53:50;"- No, there's nothing-- no, no, no, no."
53:50;53:52;"Like, um, what I'm saying is that maybe he's heard"
53:52;53:54;"some of the show, and he thinks, ""Well, this is"
53:54;53:58;"a little tongue-in-cheek maybe about the craft of, um,"
53:58;54:00;"these Cheetos, which I've devoted my life to,"
54:00;54:01;"and I don't want this Ezra guy--"
54:01;54:03;"- Right, he hears us talking about Frito-Lay Corporation,"
54:03;54:05;"and he's like, ""I don't know what to make of this."""
54:05;54:06;"- Maybe."
54:06;54:07;"- He heard the Donald Kendall segment."
54:07;54:10;"- Maybe he's heard our-- yeah, your takes on Brad's drink"
54:10;54:13;"and whatnot, and just, ""I don't want this Ezra"
54:13;54:14;"ripping into my--my--"""
54:14;54:16;"- Although, I will say one thing."
54:16;54:19;"Sorry to brag."
54:19;54:23;"Forgive me, Lord, but I'm about to brag."
54:23;54:26;"- Is this gonna be a humble brag or, like, a full-on brag?"
54:26;54:29;"- This is a full-on brag."
54:29;54:32;"Lord, forgive me, but I'm going back to the old me."
54:32;54:35;"I tried to tame my ego,"
54:35;54:39;"but sometimes I can't keep it in check."
54:39;54:40;"- Oh, my God."
54:40;54:42;"- Lord, forgive me. Here we go."
54:42;54:44;"So I followed him for a long time,"
54:44;54:45;"even when he was private,"
54:45;54:48;"and you needed him to personally approve you."
54:48;54:50;"- He still is private. - Oh, he still is private."
54:50;54:52;"- With 63,000 followers."
54:52;54:54;"- Wow. - What a piece of [bleep]"
54:54;54:56;"- What? - No, no."
54:56;54:59;"No, no, I mean, like, not--not really."
54:59;55:02;"- Do you think he's personally going through and, like, okaying?"
55:02;55:03;"- Absolutely."
55:03;55:06;"- I take that back, Richard. That was--"
55:06;55:08;"- See, Seinfeld, you're--man."
55:08;55:10;"- I'm still-- - So, anyway, here's my brag."
55:10;55:13;"- Cut that. - Here's my brag."
55:13;55:15;"- Seinfeld's going--I mean-- - See, you know what--"
55:15;55:18;"- Episode 101 starts the decline of Seinfeld."
55:18;55:21;"- Yeah. - We're slowly building the story."
55:21;55:24;"- Right. - By episode 120, he's off the show."
55:24;55:25;"- Making a lot of edibies."
55:25;55:29;"- From episode 9 to 100, Seinfeld was rehabilitated,"
55:29;55:31;"brought back into the fold."
55:31;55:34;"From 101 to 150..."
55:34;55:36;"- A dark spiral."
55:36;55:39;"- One of the most precipitous falls from grace"
55:39;55:41;"ever recorded on an Internet radio show."
55:41;55:43;"- Seth Meyers, if you're listening,"
55:43;55:45;"I was also joking earlier"
55:45;55:48;"when I told you to go [bleep] yourself."
55:48;55:50;"- Episode 101 to 150 is called"
55:50;55:53;"""The Rise of Winter and the Fall of Seinfeld."""
55:53;55:56;"- People thought I was Winter at MSG."
55:56;55:58;"They were like, ""Yo, Winter!"""
55:58;56:00;"- Really? - Yeah, I'm like, ""Come on."""
56:00;56:04;"Anyway. [laughter]"
56:04;56:06;"- You guys could be, like, cousins."
56:06;56:09;"Oh, I was about to brag."
56:09;56:11;"""One Time."""
56:11;56:13;"And this is also--you know what's funny about this, too?"
56:13;56:16;"Is it's like, Richard Montanez reminds me of Jay-Z."
56:16;56:19;"I've spoken on the show about how Jay-Z does this thing"
56:19;56:22;"where he maintains this kind of, like,"
56:22;56:24;"you know, very mysterious, like,"
56:24;56:26;"is this guy tucked away, and then he'll do things"
56:26;56:29;"just to remind people, ""I've always got my ear to the ground."
56:29;56:30;"I know what's going on."""
56:30;56:32;"I've heard a lot of stories like that."
56:32;56:34;"You know, and they're all pretty mild things."
56:34;56:36;"Nothing crazy, but just, like, that people--"
56:36;56:38;"you know, 'cause people probably wonder with a guy like Jay-Z."
56:38;56:40;"I mean, for all we know, he's an incredibly wealthy guy."
56:40;56:42;"For all we know, he's, like, semi-retired."
56:42;56:44;"But then he'll, like, always let people know, like,"
56:44;56:46;"""Oh, no, I noticed what you said."
56:46;56:48;"I noticed what you're doing."
56:48;56:50;"Um, I'm up on stuff."""
56:50;56:52;"And there's some about Richard Montanez where I was kind of like,"
56:52;56:54;"""All right, this guy doesn't give a [bleep] about TC."""
56:54;56:56;"He probably just thought I was like, ""What is this?"
56:56;56:58;"I don't know who Vampire Weekend is."
56:58;57:00;"Seinfeld 2000 sounds like a real weirdo."""
57:00;57:02;"I don't want to--I wouldn't touch this in a 10-foot pole."
57:02;57:04;"- I think he thought that about you."
57:04;57:06;"- So then I follow him, and I'm just one of his many followers."
57:06;57:09;"And I was kind of like, ""This guy's too busy."
57:09;57:11;"He's a major corporate figure, you know?"
57:11;57:13;"Like, what does he care about this stuff?"""
57:13;57:15;"And then out of nowhere, I posted an old picture."
57:15;57:17;"It probably was Father's Day."
57:17;57:19;"I posted this old black-and-white photo"
57:19;57:21;"of me and my dad."
57:21;57:23;"I'm a baby."
57:23;57:25;"My dad's, like, young mid-30s"
57:25;57:27;"in our apartment in New York."
57:27;57:30;"A little while after that, just out of nowhere,"
57:30;57:32;"I get a comment on it"
57:32;57:34;"from Hot Cheetos RPM,"
57:34;57:36;"Richard Montanez,"
57:36;57:39;"and just said, ""Cool pic."""
57:39;57:41;"- [laughs] - Wow."
57:41;57:43;"- And I was like, ""Whoa."""
57:43;57:45;"It felt like a very--it was a very Jay-Z-esque move,"
57:45;57:47;"just to be, like, you're all in your head,"
57:47;57:49;"like, ""This person even--"""
57:49;57:51;"And then just, like, this kind of very mysterious, like,"
57:51;57:53;"""Oh, hey, I got my eye on you."""
57:53;57:55;"So, of course, I was thrilled,"
57:55;57:57;"and I was like, ""Whatever,"""
57:57;57:59;"but, you know, interesting."
57:59;58:01;"- So he follows you back?"
58:01;58:03;"- I--wait, how do you know if somebody follows you back?"
58:03;58:05;"- So you got to look at their followers,"
58:05;58:07;"then you got to type your own handle"
58:07;58:09;"into their list of followers"
58:09;58:11;"and then they're following you."
58:11;58:13;"- What?"
58:13;58:15;"- So you go to their, like, number, like,"
58:15;58:17;"""Richard Montanez is following 400 people,"" whatever,"
58:17;58:19;"then it goes to a list. - I feel like I probably--"
58:19;58:21;"- Oh, yeah, yeah, the list. - There's, like, a search bar."
58:21;58:23;"- He's only following 373 people."
58:23;58:25;"- I was close. - No, he doesn't follow me."
58:25;58:27;"- Well, then how the hell did he end up--"
58:27;58:29;"- He was just--maybe he was just poking around."
58:29;58:31;"Maybe he saw me liking his pics."
58:31;58:33;"- He might have popped up on the Explorer."
58:33;58:35;"- And you have, like, a blue check verified thing."
58:35;58:37;"- Yeah, so maybe he was like, ""Who is this dude?"""
58:37;58:39;"And, like, that picture wasn't even new at the time."
58:39;58:41;"- He might have been on the Explorer page."
58:41;58:43;"- Maybe. - You're swiping around"
58:43;58:45;"on the Explorer."
58:45;58:47;"- Anyway, shout-out to Richard Montanez."
58:47;58:49;"Um, I can't wait for this movie."
58:49;58:51;"Maybe we should see if we get Eva Longoria to call in."
58:51;58:53;"- I think he could have really seized the opportunity"
58:53;58:55;"to respond to his comment, being like,"
58:55;58:57;"""Hey, man, you come on 'The Time Crisis'?"
58:57;58:59;"""Like, we've been trying so hard. Seinfeld's been doing"
58:59;59:01;"""everything he can."" You know,"
59:01;59:03;"that would have been the moment to really..."
59:03;59:05;"- ""Hey, man, I'd love to."
59:05;59:07;"""I don't like that Seinfeld guy."""
59:07;59:09;"[laughter] - He's a friends guy."
59:09;59:11;"- So anyway, the film"
59:11;59:13;"tells the story of his life."
59:13;59:15;"The script will be written by Louis Kallek,"
59:15;59:17;"who wrote ""October Sky,"" ""Domestic Disturbance,"""
59:17;59:19;"and ""Charlie St. Cloud."""
59:19;59:21;"Longoria's directed episodes of shows like"
59:21;59:23;"""Jane the Virgin,"" ""Black-ish,"" and ""Grand Hotel,"""
59:23;59:25;"and she beat out multiple directors for the job"
59:25;59:27;"with her authentic approach to portraying"
59:27;59:29;"the inspiring story of Richard and Judy Montanez."
59:29;59:31;"I don't know that much about Judy."
59:31;59:33;"Is that his wife?"
59:33;59:35;"- Probably. - Assuming so."
59:35;59:37;"- I wonder what it's gonna be called."
59:37;59:39;"Is it gonna be a Hot Cheeto pun?"
59:39;59:41;"- It's called ""Flamin' Hot."" - For real?"
59:41;59:43;"- Yeah. - I'm still curious"
59:43;59:45;"to see where the movie goes after the"
59:45;59:47;"invention of..."
59:47;59:49;"the"
59:49;59:51;"""Flamin' Hot Cheeto."" Like,"
59:51;59:53;"there'll be a big buildup of, like, he's"
59:53;59:55;"invented the Cheeto, but he's just trying to get the"
59:55;59:57;"Cheeto across the desk"
59:57;59:59;"of, like, the higher-ups at Frito-Lay."
59:59;01:00:01;"There's probably gonna be a lot of scenes"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"of, like, ""You're just a janitor."""
01:00:03;01:00:05;"- Right. Well, yeah, I wonder"
01:00:05;01:00:07;"is, like, him... does he invent"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"the Flamin' Hot Cheeto in, like, the first 20"
01:00:09;01:00:11;"minutes? - Right."
01:00:11;01:00:13;"- Or is that, like, big, like, towards the"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"end? 'Cause there's a version where he, like,"
01:00:15;01:00:17;"invents the... - I bet they're coming out of the gate"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"with him inventing it fast. That's my guess."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"- Like, a little bit of backstory. - Yeah."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"- His immigration story. - Yeah."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"- And then maybe from then on, it's about..."
01:00:25;01:00:27;"Well, then he becomes, like, probably, like, a low-level"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"executive, so there's still him working his"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"way up the corporate ladder,"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"dealing with the stigmas of,"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"you know, being"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"a Hispanic immigrant, not your typical"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"Caucasian"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"American corporate dude, plus"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"his backstory as a janitor. So, yeah, I wonder if he"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"invents it, and people are like, ""All right, this is doing pretty"
01:00:45;01:00:47;"well. Montaigne is, like, yeah,"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"but, you know, don't get too excited."""
01:00:49;01:00:51;"I guess it's also the larger story"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"is not just about Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"It's about building, like,"
01:00:55;01:00:57;"the whole Flamin' Hot empire within Frito-Lays."
01:00:57;01:00:59;"- I feel like he..."
01:00:59;01:01:01;"- This is so deep."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"- He posted something once that was about some other"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"product that they... 'Cause basically, there's a Flamin'"
01:01:05;01:01:07;"Hot version of almost anything you could think of."
01:01:07;01:01:09;"You know? Like, it was a Flamin' Hot"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"cheddar popcorn or something, and he"
01:01:11;01:01:13;"was posted about how, like, when I first"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"pitched this, one of the food scientists"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"said it was impossible, and I was like,"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"""Come on, let's make it happen."" Wait, let me see."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"- I like that there's now, like, a small"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"genre of films pertaining to, like,"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"fast food and"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"snack foods."
01:01:27;01:01:29;"We got Fast Food Nation, the Richard Linklater"

01:01:31;01:01:33;"Very dark. - Yeah."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"- And then... - The Founder. - The Founder,"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"which we saw in the theater together. - Yep."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"- Pretty solid. - I still think back"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"on that. - Pretty solid movie. - I wish it was a"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"tiny bit better, because it's..."
01:01:43;01:01:45;"it's such a good story. - Yeah."
01:01:45;01:01:47;"- Yeah, I don't know what... That always pops into my head, like,"
01:01:47;01:01:49;"that part at the end when he says"
01:01:49;01:01:51;"to the McDonald brothers, ""You know what I needed?"
01:01:51;01:01:53;"I needed your name."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"Ray Kroc."
01:01:55;01:01:57;"What does that make people think of? Croc-a-sh*t."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"McDonald's."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"That's an all-American name."" - Wow, that's a good memory."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"- I don't know, it just made a big impression on me."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"I feel like I thought of that recently"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"for some reason. It is a good"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"movie, and it's just like..."
01:02:09;01:02:11;"- I wish it was R instead of PG-13."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"- There's just a..."
01:02:13;01:02:15;"There's a version of it that could have been"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"""There Will Be Blood."" - Oh, absolutely."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"- It's so... - Ruthless capitalism."
01:02:19;01:02:21;"- It echoes ""There Will Be Blood"" in so many"

01:02:23;01:02:25;"one of the McDonald's brothers. - Right."
01:02:25;01:02:27;"And I think that character"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"actor, John Carroll Lynch... - Is the"
01:02:29;01:02:31;"other guy? - Is the other one. - Oh, yeah, he's a great actor."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"- I see him around"
01:02:33;01:02:35;"Eagle Rock. - Oh, really? - I went in"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"a few weeks ago."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"I popped into the Chipotle."

01:09:06;01:09:08;"Weirdly I thought that would have been earlier"

01:09:16;01:09:18;"Well I guess that's cool"
01:09:18;01:09:20;"That means that Flamin' Hot the film"
01:09:20;01:09:23;"is gonna be a '90s movie"
01:09:23;01:09:24;"Great"
01:09:24;01:09:27;"You know, catching up on my touring and plane rides"

01:09:29;01:09:32;"Captain Marvel takes place in the '90s"
01:09:32;01:09:34;"and at first I was kind of into elements of it"
01:09:34;01:09:37;"but then just like every single, you know, transition"
01:09:37;01:09:39;"just like blasting some like big '90s songs"
01:09:39;01:09:41;"just like driving down the highway"

01:10:04;01:10:07;"on the soundtrack to the Flamin' Hot movie"
01:10:07;01:10:09;"So the number 5 song, classic"

01:10:11;01:10:13;"Wow"
01:10:17;01:10:20;"Like a 9-minute ballad in the top 5"

01:11:02;01:11:04;"Why are you still sitting there?"

01:11:59;01:12:00;"Oh, let me check that out"
01:12:00;01:12:03;"And he apparently was pushing to have this song"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"be on Appetite"
01:12:05;01:12:07;"which would have been a completely different record"
01:12:07;01:12:09;"There's no room for like a true ballad"
01:12:09;01:12:10;"Yeah, like a huge eight in it"

01:12:12;01:12:15;"Sweet Child O' Mine was like the ballad"

01:13:37;01:13:38;"all those Guns N' Roses"
01:13:38;01:13:39;"He raps them a lot"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"And for whatever reason"
01:13:41;01:13:43;"I didn't know that song ""Patience"""
01:13:43;01:13:45;"And now I feel like I hear it all the time"
01:13:45;01:13:46;"I'm super into that"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"Yeah, ""Patience"" rules"
01:13:48;01:13:57;"I mean, this is a really well-written song"
01:13:57;01:13:58;"It's weird that"
01:13:58;01:14:01;"I wish he wrote more beautiful ballads"
01:14:01;01:14:02;"Does he get all the way to the outro?"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"The famous outro?"
01:14:04;01:14:11;"So I don't think he had the"
01:14:11;01:14:12;"That like slash part?"
01:14:12;01:14:13;"Yeah"
01:14:13;01:14:17;"I remember when I was a kid"
01:14:17;01:14:18;"I knew this song"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"And I don't know why"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"But the outro spoke to me so much"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"I was like, ""That part rules"""
01:14:24;01:14:25;"Yeah"
01:14:25;01:14:26;"And then I would hear the rest of it"
01:14:26;01:14:27;"And I'd just be like, ""This sucks so bad"""
01:14:27;01:14:29;"Like, get to the slash part"
01:14:30;01:14:32;"[Guitar solo]"
01:14:32;01:14:41;"This is so fun"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"Yeah, I feel like I heard this when I was like 9"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"I was just like"
01:14:45;01:14:47;"This part gives me chills"
01:14:47;01:14:50;"[Imitates guitar]"
01:14:50;01:14:53;"It's funny, when I was 9"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"I remember hearing the harmonized guitar outro"
01:14:55;01:14:57;"Of Hotel California"
01:14:57;01:14:58;"Oh yeah"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"And I was like, ""Damn"""
01:15:00;01:15:02;"That gives me chills"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"I mean, that part's amazing"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"Anyway, November Rain, great song"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"The November Rain of 2019"
01:15:08;01:15:11;"Senorita, Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello"
01:15:11;01:15:14;"You know they're a couple?"
01:15:14;01:15:17;"I think I did know that"
01:15:17;01:15:24;"Shawn Mendes is part of a huge Tim Hortons campaign"
01:15:24;01:15:25;"Oh right"
01:15:25;01:15:26;"Right now, yeah"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"Yeah, we were talking about that on the TC thread"
01:15:28;01:15:31;"How Shawn Mendes did a very kind of earnest"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"Commercial for Tim Hortons"
01:15:33;01:15:36;"That reflects on his Canadian heritage"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"And it shows him as a little boy"
01:15:38;01:15:41;"That's kind of like him walking up to buy a donut at Tim Hortons"
01:15:41;01:15:42;"They're like, ""Hey Shawn!"""
01:15:42;01:15:45;"And he's like a little boy throwing up some change on the thing"
01:15:45;01:15:47;"And it's like a real feel-good thing"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"And Shawn Mendes"
01:15:49;01:15:52;"Who came through the Vampire Weekend Webster Hall show"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"Me and R.L. chopped it up with him"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"He's a super nice guy, super cool"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"And he's just like"
01:15:58;01:16:01;"You know, kind of what you'd expect from a Canadian pop star"
01:16:01;01:16:05;"Talented, cool, humble"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"Perfect guy for a Tim Hortons campaign"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"The thing that I was reflecting on was like"
01:16:09;01:16:13;"How you just can't picture Justin Bieber having a Tim Hortons campaign"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"And then, so just picturing"
01:16:15;01:16:17;"So I was thinking more about that"
01:16:17;01:16:20;"I'm not trying to pit them against each other"
01:16:20;01:16:23;"Why does Shawn Mendes feel so much more Canadian than Bieber?"
01:16:23;01:16:27;"Did Bieber renounce his Canadian vibe?"
01:16:27;01:16:30;"Weigh in on this Seinfeld, you're the resident Canadian"
01:16:30;01:16:31;"Oh wow, okay"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"Well, Bieber"
01:16:33;01:16:36;"So Bieber fully embraced the American lifestyle, right?"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"He was co-opted by Usher"
01:16:38;01:16:41;"Didn't he record his first album at like Atlanta?"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"Yeah, I believe so"
01:16:43;01:16:45;"Then doesn't he live in like Calabasas or something?"
01:16:45;01:16:46;"Yeah"
01:16:46;01:16:49;"And then he was like driving around with his Maserati and f***ing in buckets"
01:16:49;01:16:52;"I'm not saying that's synonymous with American culture"
01:16:52;01:16:53;"But I'm saying"
01:16:53;01:16:55;"You don't f*** in buckets up there in Canada"
01:16:55;01:16:57;"You never do"
01:16:57;01:16:59;"It's been a while"
01:16:59;01:17:02;"But yeah, so I mean I just feel like"
01:17:02;01:17:06;"Shawn Mendes has just been a gentler, more wholesome presence"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"He never really had that"
01:17:08;01:17:11;"Those wild years, those wilderness"
01:17:11;01:17:13;"What are those, salad days?"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"Is that what you said? No"
01:17:15;01:17:16;"Salad days are good"
01:17:16;01:17:17;"You know what I'm saying though"
01:17:17;01:17:19;"So he didn't sow his wild oats"
01:17:19;01:17:20;"There you go"
01:17:20;01:17:23;"Maybe this is the beginning of the wild oats being sowed"
01:17:23;01:17:26;"Like maybe he'll break up with Camila and"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"F*** in a bucket"
01:17:28;01:17:29;"Renounce Tim Hortons"
01:17:29;01:17:30;"Right, yeah"
01:17:30;01:17:33;"But it's funny because when I was talking about how like"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"You can't picture Justin Bieber just like"
01:17:35;01:17:37;"Humbly sipping on like a hot Tim Hortons"
01:17:37;01:17:39;"I mean we found a picture of him"
01:17:39;01:17:42;"Just like wearing some like f***ing like ragged-ass street wear"
01:17:42;01:17:43;"Like crazy outfit"
01:17:43;01:17:45;"Holding like a giant Starbucks"
01:17:45;01:17:47;"And you're like yeah that's Bieber"
01:17:47;01:17:50;"It's like a giant Starbucks iced coffee"
01:17:50;01:17:52;"And Shawn Mendes is a little more like"
01:17:52;01:17:57;"Oh you know man, I just like to get a nice hot coffee from"
01:17:57;01:17:58;"Tim Hortons"
01:17:58;01:18:01;"Yeah, like stop by Timmy's, get a nice hot coffee"
01:18:01;01:18:03;"You know it's real cold outside"
01:18:03;01:18:05;"Like Justin Bieber"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"Just like picturing Justin Bieber like"
01:18:07;01:18:10;"Back on Ontario in like October"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"And it's like 50 degrees"
01:18:12;01:18:16;"And he's just like what the f***"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"F*** this s***"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"Why is it so f***ing cold?"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"And like everybody's like"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"Oh Justin remember you know when you were a little boy"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"We had when it was really cold in the winter"
01:18:26;01:18:29;"You know it was going down to negative 5 degrees"
01:18:29;01:18:31;"And he's like no honestly f*** this s***"
01:18:31;01:18:33;"I want an ice, it's too cold to have a f***ing iced coffee"
01:18:33;01:18:35;"Like can the plane leave?"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"F***ing sick of this s***"
01:18:37;01:18:40;"Just breaking all the rules of being a good Canadian"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"Wearing a Gucci bucket hat"
01:18:42;01:18:45;"Is it lame as a Canadian to complain about the cold?"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"We complain about the cold"
01:18:47;01:18:50;"It's kind of part of the lifestyle"
01:18:50;01:18:51;"Is it lame?"
01:18:51;01:18:54;"No I think it's par for the course"
01:18:54;01:18:56;"But do you have to have like a smile about it?"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"Like do you have to be a little bit like"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"Oh it's so cold, wow"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"Do we have a smile about it?"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"No I mean it's pretty miserable"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"Like we're not exempt from the human condition"
01:19:06;01:19:09;"So you're allowed to walk in to"
01:19:09;01:19:12;"And I mean I'm talking about like the real Canada"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"I'm not talking about you know"
01:19:14;01:19:18;"I'm not talking about a downtown penthouse in Toronto"
01:19:18;01:19:21;"I'm talking about real Canadians"
01:19:21;01:19:25;"What like the Yukon, the Northwest Territories?"
01:19:25;01:19:27;"Newfoundland?"
01:19:27;01:19:29;"I'm talking about Calgary, no I don't know"
01:19:29;01:19:31;"I'm just talking about like"
01:19:31;01:19:32;"Toronto gets pretty cold"
01:19:32;01:19:33;"Medicine hat"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"Yeah I'm talking about medicine hat"
01:19:35;01:19:36;"At a certain point"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"No I know Toronto gets cold"
01:19:38;01:19:40;"But also Toronto's gotten very like full of money"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"And built up lately"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"Jeez, yeah"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"Tell me more about how Toronto's been doing"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"I just heard that because like"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"I was just talking to like a promoter in Toronto"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"And they were just like"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"Like the tickets for our Toronto show went very quickly"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"And they're like oh Toronto's a very hot market lately"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"And I was like oh yeah well Toronto's a great city"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"That doesn't surprise me, why is it hotter now?"
01:20:00;01:20:03;"And they're just like oh you know they built up downtown"
01:20:03;01:20:06;"So many new, so many kind of like yuppies moving in"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"This accent, it's subtle"
01:20:08;01:20:10;"He's doing good work"
01:20:10;01:20:12;"I'm doing real subtle"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"All these yuppies moving in in Toronto"
01:20:14;01:20:16;"Does everybody, not for Vampire Weekend in general"
01:20:16;01:20:19;"Even though we, you know I'll admit we have some yuppie fans"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"But they're just saying just generally speaking"
01:20:21;01:20:24;"A lot more young people with money"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"Have filled up Toronto"
01:20:26;01:20:29;"So that there's more like, more concert tickets sell"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"And I'm sure there's way more restaurants and coffee shops"
01:20:31;01:20:35;"And bars to you know serve a kind of international elite"
01:20:35;01:20:38;"So Toronto's over the past decade"
01:20:38;01:20:41;"Toronto's like waterfront got developed quite a bit"
01:20:41;01:20:44;"And filled with these condos that have sprung up overnight"
01:20:44;01:20:47;"Essentially so it's just like this wall to wall"
01:20:47;01:20:50;"Like the skyline is just, like around where the CN Tower is"
01:20:50;01:20:53;"It's just yeah wall to wall condos"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"So it's like with any city, it's like Austin, Texas"
01:20:55;01:20:58;"And obviously New York, it's always a part of the New York story"
01:20:58;01:21:01;"Is that the people who were there before all the condos went up"
01:21:01;01:21:04;"Being a little bit like oh look at you guys"
01:21:04;01:21:07;"Because usually the crowd that comes in with the condos is not locals"
01:21:07;01:21:09;"So there's maybe a feeling of like"
01:21:09;01:21:12;"Are you really down with what it means to like love this place"
01:21:12;01:21:17;"Or you just want a kind of anonymous, wealthy aesthetic"
01:21:17;01:21:20;"True yeah, downtown Los Angeles you're seeing it happen"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"Oh yeah you're seeing it, of course you're seeing it in every city"
01:21:22;01:21:27;"But I'm saying in Canada which is a specific very you know proud place"
01:21:27;01:21:31;"I just wonder if your attitude towards the cold"
01:21:31;01:21:36;"Maybe separates the new condo people from the old school"
01:21:36;01:21:39;"So you walk into your office in downtown Toronto"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"And one person walks in and is like"
01:21:41;01:21:45;"Oh man it was so cold out there I thought my damn eyeballs"
01:21:45;01:21:48;"Were about to freeze and fall out and shatter on the ground"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"And everybody's like oh yeah it was cold"
01:21:50;01:21:51;"Then somebody else comes in and is like"
01:21:51;01:21:54;"F*** it was f***ing cold, f*** this winter"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"Jesus f***ing Christ I hate it"
01:21:56;01:21:59;"And then that person is like oh yeah"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"Like one person is more like the Shawn Mendes"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"And one person is the Justin Bieber"
01:22:03;01:22:04;"You know what I mean?"
01:22:04;01:22:08;"Yeah I think you'd find that about maybe people who have come from like"
01:22:08;01:22:11;"I don't know like if somebody moved there from like California or something"
01:22:11;01:22:12;"You might"
01:22:12;01:22:15;"Hey gang Corporate wants to shake things up a bit"
01:22:15;01:22:17;"So we're bringing in a new manager"
01:22:17;01:22:19;"You're gonna report directly to him"
01:22:19;01:22:23;"His name's Steve and he comes from Miami"
01:22:23;01:22:26;"And then that guy, and I just feel like that guy comes in"
01:22:26;01:22:29;"And he's like holy f*** it's cold"
01:22:29;01:22:31;"Jesus f***ing Christ"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"How do people do it?"
01:22:33;01:22:34;"This f***ing sucks"
01:22:34;01:22:35;"Why do you live here?"
01:22:35;01:22:36;"That's right"
01:22:36;01:22:37;"Steve is always sick"
01:22:37;01:22:38;"Yeah"
01:22:38;01:22:39;"He's just always congested"
01:22:39;01:22:42;"He wants to keep the office temp at 85 degrees"
01:22:42;01:22:44;"And he's just like guzzling iced coffee"
01:22:44;01:22:45;"That's right"
01:22:45;01:22:47;"He's like the iced coffee doesn't feel good"
01:22:47;01:22:50;"You're like it's a little bit too hot now"
01:22:50;01:22:52;"He's like well I wanna drink my f***ing iced coffee"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"That iced coffee doesn't hit right"
01:22:54;01:22:56;"Under 85"
01:22:56;01:22:59;"You know but I will say that maybe like in Calgary for example"
01:22:59;01:23:02;"Maybe people do take it a little bit more like"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"This is a fact of life"
01:23:04;01:23:07;"Where there maybe is a little bit more yuppie griping about it"
01:23:07;01:23:08;"Right"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"Well and also obviously I have no idea what I'm talking about"
01:23:10;01:23:13;"Because in New York you know even native New Yorkers"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"Will be like I f***ing hate winter"
01:23:15;01:23:18;"I wanna, the wanting to move to Miami is a classic New York trope"
01:23:18;01:23:20;"Even from born and raised Brooklyn people"
01:23:20;01:23:21;"Exactly"
01:23:21;01:23:22;"Midnight cowboy"
01:23:22;01:23:23;"Wanna go to Miami"
01:23:23;01:23:29;"So you know obviously you're allowed to be a proud OG native of a place"
01:23:29;01:23:31;"And still hate the cold"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"But obviously New York cold versus Canadian cold"
01:23:33;01:23:38;"It's like you know the cold is more a part of the culture in a way"
01:23:38;01:23:39;"Yeah I would say so"
01:23:39;01:23:42;"So you're saying it's okay to be a Canadian and hate the cold?"
01:23:42;01:23:46;"I'd say it's even like a bonding mechanism to complain about the cold"
01:23:46;01:23:47;"It's the thing that brings us together"
01:23:47;01:23:50;"You know what right so maybe it's just about your attitude towards community"
01:23:50;01:23:51;"There you go"
01:23:51;01:23:56;"Are you gonna come in and complain about it in an individualistic American"
01:23:56;01:24:00;"You know private healthcare type of way?"
01:24:00;01:24:03;"Are you gonna just come in and be like f*** it's cold"
01:24:03;01:24:04;"I'm so cold"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"Why would God do this to me?"
01:24:06;01:24:09;"Versus maybe the more Canadian way is to just be like"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"F*** it's cold"
01:24:11;01:24:12;"Why would God do this to us?"
01:24:12;01:24:14;"Let's go to Timmy's and have a hot coffee together"
01:24:14;01:24:15;"Yeah"
01:24:15;01:24:17;"Hey guys we're all cold"
01:24:17;01:24:20;"Let's go thaw out"
01:24:20;01:24:23;"Justin we're all cold"
01:24:23;01:24:27;"Justin sit down for a second"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"Justin we're all cold"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"Sean's cold"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"Sean's very cold"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"But he's not talking the way you're talking"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"Do you think you're any colder than Sean?"
01:24:37;01:24:38;"Justin?"
01:24:38;01:24:40;"Sean might even be colder than you Justin"
01:24:40;01:24:41;"What?"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"Oh my God"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"Okay let's keep moving"

01:24:53;01:25:12;"Little dancing days in there"
01:25:12;01:25:15;"Yeah it's an interpolation of Led Zeppelin's Dancing Days"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"Everybody's dancing"
01:25:17;01:25:26;"Six minutes"
01:25:26;01:25:28;"This one is?"

01:25:32;01:25:34;"Yeah a lot of long songs"
01:25:34;01:25:37;"That you don't care where I'm at"
01:25:37;01:25:41;"You give me reason to doubt you"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"Say you trust someone"
01:25:43;01:25:46;"Why you calling all around?"
01:25:46;01:25:49;"Think I'm some dip on the side"
01:25:49;01:25:52;"Girl you don't trust no one"
01:25:52;01:25:55;"And your car's still hanging out"
01:25:55;01:25:59;"You know it's a game if you play that away"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"Get up on my back"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"Take a fart like"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"Yeah"

01:26:07;01:26:09;"Humping Around"
01:26:09;01:26:13;"His '93 world tour was called the Humping Around the World Tour"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"That's sick"
01:26:15;01:26:24;"What's he saying? Ain't nobody humping around?"
01:26:24;01:26:27;"It's like his girlfriend thinks he's cheating on her"
01:26:27;01:26:30;"But he's saying nobody's humping around"
01:26:30;01:26:33;"But the tour is called Humping Around"
01:26:33;01:26:38;"Wait, I gotta look up the lyrics"
01:26:38;01:26:40;"In this song specifically"
01:26:40;01:26:43;"I'm not humping around but the tour"
01:26:43;01:26:46;"I know why you think I'd be humping around"
01:26:46;01:26:51;"The chorus is get off my back"
01:26:51;01:26:52;"Save a heart attack"
01:26:52;01:26:54;"Ain't nobody humping around"
01:26:54;01:26:55;"No matter what they say"
01:26:55;01:26:56;"No it ain't that way"
01:26:56;01:26:58;"Ain't nobody humping around"
01:26:58;01:27:00;"He's not cheating"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"When you trust someone and you know you're on their back"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"You ain't got no trusting about you"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"And you claim that you don't care where I'm at"
01:27:06;01:27:07;"You've given me reason to doubt you"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"Say you trust someone, why are you calling around?"
01:27:09;01:27:10;"Think I've got some dip on the side"
01:27:10;01:27:11;"Girl you don't trust no one"
01:27:11;01:27:12;"You're constantly in doubt"
01:27:12;01:27:14;"You lose the game if you play that way"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"I think he's saying like"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"I'm not cheating on you"
01:27:18;01:27:20;"But damn it"
01:27:20;01:27:22;"You're"
01:27:22;01:27:24;"You're making this difficult"
01:27:24;01:27:26;"You're making, yeah"
01:27:26;01:27:28;"The fact that you don't trust me"
01:27:28;01:27:29;"Is alienating me"
01:27:29;01:27:30;"And let's keep it real"
01:27:30;01:27:32;"Why do people cheat sometimes?"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"Because they become alienated from their partner"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"And then they start humping"
01:27:36;01:27:37;"Yeah"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"Humping"
01:27:39;01:27:44;"Humping is such a funny"
01:27:44;01:27:47;"Euphemism for an adult to be using"
01:27:47;01:27:48;"In a song"
01:27:48;01:27:49;"It was truly like"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"Humping was very much like"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"You're like in like fifth grade"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"And you have like vague understanding of like"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"How's the mechanics of sex"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"Yeah, humping"
01:27:59;01:28:00;"Dry humping?"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"Yeah, dry humping"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"People always talk about that in like middle school"
01:28:03;01:28:04;"Right"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"Oh man, they're dry humping"
01:28:06;01:28:08;"Dry"
01:28:08;01:28:10;"Yeah, dry humping versus wet humping"
01:28:10;01:28:12;"Oh"
01:28:12;01:28:15;"I've never heard wet humping before this round"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"Wet humping is just humping"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"You don't need the"
01:28:19;01:28:22;"The wetness is implied"
01:28:22;01:28:24;"So then we started humping"
01:28:24;01:28:26;"Was it dry or wet?"
01:28:26;01:28:30;"A hundred of those are like deeper album cuts on this record"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"Dry humping track one"
01:28:32;01:28:34;"No, but he's making a good point"
01:28:34;01:28:36;"He's talking about that"
01:28:36;01:28:37;"You know that you're holding on too tight"
01:28:37;01:28:40;"Soon they will be leaving without you"
01:28:40;01:28:41;"He's saying that"
01:28:41;01:28:42;"That's the irony"
01:28:42;01:28:43;"And this is true"
01:28:43;01:28:46;"Think about, I mean Bobby Brown"
01:28:46;01:28:48;"I think identifies as male, but"
01:28:48;01:28:50;"You know, the classic"
01:28:50;01:28:52;"We often think about the controlling"
01:28:52;01:28:55;"We often think about the controlling boyfriend"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"That's a very familiar figure, right?"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"That's like the guy who is"
01:28:59;01:29:03;"So jealous and like crazy towards his girlfriend"
01:29:03;01:29:04;"Possessive"
01:29:04;01:29:06;"Possessive, you're talking to him, what the f***"
01:29:06;01:29:08;"That eventually he holds on way too tight"
01:29:08;01:29:10;"And then she's like, in her mind, she's like"
01:29:10;01:29:11;"Well this guy's insane"
01:29:11;01:29:12;"Maybe I will cheat on him"
01:29:12;01:29:14;"I'm sick of him"
01:29:14;01:29:17;"And I guess Bobby's talking about, you know, presumably a woman"
01:29:17;01:29:18;"Who's like that, she's calling all his friends"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"And he's like"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"But maybe he is gaslighting her"
01:29:22;01:29:24;"When you think about it that"
01:29:24;01:29:26;"In 1992 he releases a song whose hook is"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"Ain't nobody humping around"
01:29:28;01:29:30;"And it's funny that the song is just called Humping Around"
01:29:30;01:29:33;"She's like, why is the song just called Humping Around?"
01:29:33;01:29:34;"He's like, 'cause it's shorter"
01:29:34;01:29:37;"Okay, in the song I say Ain't nobody humping around"
01:29:37;01:29:39;"Okay, but still, your new single's called Humping Around"
01:29:39;01:29:40;"It makes me feel uncomfortable"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"It's very misleading, Bobby"
01:29:42;01:29:45;"He's like, oh my God"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"Wait, was he with Whitney Houston?"
01:29:47;01:29:48;"They're probably just getting together now"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"They got together in the early 90s"
01:29:50;01:29:53;"And he's like, oh my God, chill"
01:29:53;01:29:56;"She's like, couldn't you have at least called it Humping Around"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"And then in parentheses before, Ain't no?"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"Like I can't get no satisfaction"
01:30:00;01:30:03;"And he's like, look, people just call the song Satisfaction"
01:30:03;01:30:04;"So it doesn't even matter"
01:30:04;01:30:06;"It's just called Humping Around"
01:30:06;01:30:07;"When they hear the song, they're gonna hear me saying"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"Ain't nobody humping around"
01:30:09;01:30:10;"That makes it very clear"
01:30:10;01:30:12;"She's like, okay"
01:30:12;01:30:15;"Okay, he's like, baby, please listen to the song"
01:30:15;01:30:18;"If you keep nagging me, things are gonna go really sideways"
01:30:18;01:30:21;"Okay, Bobby, I trust you"
01:30:21;01:30:25;"And then like, next year, just like"
01:30:25;01:30:29;"Alright, like, got the tour T-shirts printed up"
01:30:29;01:30:30;"Getting ready to go"
01:30:30;01:30:32;"Oh, can I see one? Yeah, sure"
01:30:32;01:30:36;"It's called the Humping Around the World Tour"
01:30:36;01:30:39;"Wait, wait, Bobby"
01:30:39;01:30:42;"It's called the Humping Around the World Tour"
01:30:42;01:30:43;"Oh, yeah, yeah, because you know"
01:30:43;01:30:46;"The hit single's called Humping Around"
01:30:46;01:30:50;"Okay, I was with you up to a point"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"I understand you called the song Humping Around"
01:30:52;01:30:55;"But Humping Around the World"
01:30:55;01:30:56;"That really makes it sound like"
01:30:56;01:30:58;"You're gonna be cheating on me"
01:30:58;01:31:02;"By humping various women around the world"
01:31:02;01:31:05;"Okay, okay, you're being crazy right now"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"Okay, let's take this back to the beginning"
01:31:07;01:31:10;"The tour's called Humping Around the World"
01:31:10;01:31:11;"Because it's a world tour"
01:31:11;01:31:14;"And because the song is called Humping Around"
01:31:14;01:31:16;"Why is the song called Humping Around?"
01:31:16;01:31:17;"Because the hook of the song is"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"Ain't Nobody Humping Around"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"So when you really think about it"
01:31:21;01:31:22;"The tour is basically called"
01:31:22;01:31:25;"Ain't Nobody Humping Around the World Tour"
01:31:25;01:31:29;"It's just edited for brevity"
01:31:29;01:31:33;"Bobby, I'm trying to have this make sense"
01:31:33;01:31:37;"But I don't know, man"
01:31:37;01:31:38;"Anyway"
01:31:39;01:31:42;"The number four song in 2019"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"Oh, our good friend Post Malone"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"Oh, you're gonna be interested in this one, Jake"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"This is from his new album that just came out"
01:31:48;01:31:51;"And this one has Ozzy Osbourne and Travis Scott"
01:31:51;01:31:56;"Definitely has an Ozzy vibe already"
01:31:56;01:31:59;"Post Malone is a self-professed metal fan"
01:32:04;01:32:10;"I feel you crumbling my arms down to your heart of stone"
01:32:10;01:32:17;"You bled me dry just like the tears you never show"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"Why don't you take what you want from me"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"Take what you need from me"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"Take what you wanna go"
01:32:23;01:32:26;"Why don't you take what you want from me"
01:32:26;01:32:28;"Take what you need from me"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"Take what you wanna go"
01:32:30;01:32:33;"I never needed anything from you"
01:32:33;01:32:36;"And all I ever asked was for the truth"
01:32:36;01:32:38;"I like the Ozzy hook, it's cool"
01:32:38;01:32:41;"I wonder if Post wrote that part for Ozzy"
01:32:41;01:32:44;"I don't know, they're both credited songwriters"
01:32:44;01:32:46;"It was perfect for Ozzy"
01:32:46;01:32:49;"I was in a state where they told me to break"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"Held me down to hope and I would drown"
01:32:51;01:32:54;"Like a plague I was facing away"
01:32:54;01:32:58;"Trying to find my way out, find my way out"
01:32:58;01:33:02;"And then finally came the day"
01:33:02;01:33:05;"I start giving my heart away"
01:33:05;01:33:08;"For heaven's sake, my bones will break"
01:33:08;01:33:12;"But you never owned my soul, no"
01:33:12;01:33:19;"I feel you crumbling my arms down to your heart of stone"
01:33:19;01:33:25;"You bled me dry just like the tears you never show"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"Why don't you take what you want from me"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"Take what you need from me"
01:33:29;01:33:32;"Take what you wanna go"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"Why don't you take what you want from me"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"Take what you need from me"
01:33:36;01:33:39;"Take what you wanna go"
01:33:39;01:33:42;"I took those calls you threw me chains for the crew"
01:33:42;01:33:45;"I bought all ten of those, only made for two"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"You know, it works"
01:33:47;01:33:50;"Post Malone, Ozzy Osbourne, Travis Scott, it just works"
01:33:50;01:33:55;"Back to 1994, 1992, TLC, Baby Baby Baby"

01:36:42;01:36:43;"That's right, yeah, we did talk about this"
01:36:43;01:36:47;"Did not have a similar trajectory"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"Well, it hasn't been two years yet"
01:36:49;01:36:52;"But I feel like it was a song of ours from like 2008 or something"
01:36:52;01:36:53;"Oh, right"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"Well, you never know"
01:36:55;01:37:02;"I think her profile grew as a person and maybe the song did its thing"
01:37:02;01:37:05;"Well, shout out to Lizzo, good for her"
01:37:05;01:37:08;"Back to 1992, Patti Smith featuring Don Henley"
01:37:08;01:37:10;"but this is the Patti Smith with a Y"
01:37:10;01:37:15;"Sometimes love just ain't enough, do you know this song?"
01:37:15;01:37:18;"It sounds familiar, yeah"
01:37:18;01:37:26;"Producer Roy Bitton, is he from the E Street Band?"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"Yeah, he was the keyboardist"
01:37:28;01:37:30;"Must be the same guy"
01:37:30;01:37:33;"Yeah, he's the one who also played on all the good Meatloaf singles"
01:37:33;01:37:36;"I don't wanna lose you"
01:37:36;01:37:39;"But I don't wanna use you"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"The Professor"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"That's right"
01:37:43;01:37:47;"And I don't wanna hate you"
01:37:47;01:37:50;"I don't wanna take you"
01:37:50;01:37:54;"But I don't wanna be the one to cry"
01:37:54;01:37:56;"I don't think I've ever heard this song"
01:37:56;01:37:59;"And I don't really matter"
01:37:59;01:38:02;"Yeah, I don't even know if I have or not"
01:38:02;01:38:04;"There's so many songs that sound like this"
01:38:04;01:38:06;"Released August '92"
01:38:06;01:38:12;"But like a fool I keep losing my place"
01:38:12;01:38:16;"And I keep seeing you walk through that door"
01:38:16;01:38:18;"Has a real '80s vibe"
01:38:18;01:38:24;"There's a danger in loving somebody too much"
01:38:24;01:38:26;"And it's sad when you know"
01:38:26;01:38:29;"It's your heart you can't trust"
01:38:29;01:38:35;"There's a reason why people don't stay where they are"
01:38:35;01:38:40;"Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"Don sounded great on those harmonies"
01:38:42;01:38:45;"Does he get his own verse?"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"I'm hoping"
01:38:47;01:38:51;"Well, I can't"
01:38:51;01:38:54;"I could never change you"
01:38:54;01:38:57;"I don't wanna blame you"
01:38:57;01:38:59;"Baby, you don't have to take the fall"
01:38:59;01:39:02;"It kinda reminds me of, like, you know, like, '80s Bonnie Raitt kinda"
01:39:02;01:39:03;"Yeah"
01:39:03;01:39:05;"I guess--oh, there he goes"
01:39:05;01:39:07;"He gets half a verse"
01:39:07;01:39:10;"I guess this really does sound like early '90s"
01:39:10;01:39:14;"It's like a little bit of--it's a little bit of '80s"
01:39:14;01:39:16;"A little bit of, like, '90s coffeehouse"
01:39:16;01:39:17;"Yeah"
01:39:17;01:39:18;"It's like right on the cusp"
01:39:18;01:39:22;"Yeah, 'cause there's definitely that, like, yeah, like, anthemic, like, metal"
01:39:22;01:39:23;"Yeah"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"Like, power ballad feels"
01:39:25;01:39:26;"With Layton in it"
01:39:26;01:39:30;"And like a fool who will never see the truth"
01:39:30;01:39:36;"I keep thinking something's gonna change"
01:39:36;01:39:42;"But there's a danger in loving somebody too much"
01:39:42;01:39:48;"And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"There's a reason why people--"
01:39:50;01:39:54;"Do you know that Bonnie Tyler song, ""It's a Heartache""?"
01:39:54;01:39:56;"You know Bonnie Tyler who did, uh--"
01:39:56;01:39:57;"Total Eclipse?"
01:39:57;01:39:58;"Yeah"
01:39:58;01:40:00;"She did a hit in the late '70s"
01:40:00;01:40:02;"It just kinda reminds me of this"
01:40:02;01:40:06;"It's a great song, but it--it's weird"
01:40:06;01:40:10;"It's almost like how this song is sort of like the end of the '80s"
01:40:10;01:40:11;"Yeah"
01:40:11;01:40:14;"Her song sort of, like, foreshadows the '80s"
01:40:14;01:40:18;"Lyrically, it's like the female perspective to ""Humpin' Around"""
01:40:18;01:40:20;"Sometimes love just ain't enough"
01:40:20;01:40:23;"Check it out, ""It's a Heartache"" from '77"
01:40:26;01:40:28;"This song is tight"
01:40:28;01:40:32;"It's a heartache"
01:40:32;01:40:36;"Nothing but a heartache"
01:40:36;01:40:40;"Hits you when it's too late"
01:40:40;01:40:45;"Hits you when you're down"
01:40:45;01:40:48;"It's a fool's game"
01:40:48;01:40:52;"Nothing but a fool's game"
01:40:52;01:40:57;"Standing in the cold rain"
01:40:57;01:41:01;"Feeling like a clown"
01:41:01;01:41:05;"It's a heartache"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"Nothing but a heartache"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"It's like a little bit of, like, '70s Rod Stewart"
01:41:09;01:41:10;"Yeah"
01:41:10;01:41:13;"Love him 'til your arms break"
01:41:13;01:41:17;"Then he lets you down"
01:41:17;01:41:22;"It ain't right with love to share"
01:41:22;01:41:23;"When you find you're not there"
01:41:23;01:41:25;"Somebody else that collaborated with Roy Bitton"
01:41:25;01:41:26;"I think it's probably Roy Bitton"
01:41:26;01:41:27;"Oh, Ronnie?"
01:41:27;01:41:28;"Well, 'cause he played on Total Clips of the Heart"
01:41:28;01:41:29;"Oh, wow"
01:41:29;01:41:31;"He was like the--I guess he--between Meat Loaf and that"
01:41:31;01:41:35;"he was the go-to guy for Jim Steinman, the songwriter who wrote all those songs"
01:41:35;01:41:36;"Oh, that's right"
01:41:36;01:41:40;"I think we did a little Jim Steinman deep dive in one of those eps"
01:41:40;01:41:43;"Back to 2019, ""One Republic"" back on the charts"
01:41:43;01:41:44;"It's somebody to love"
01:41:44;01:41:46;"Haven't heard from them in a minute"
01:41:47;01:41:49;"Never could imagine"
01:41:49;01:41:51;"Who's One Republic?"
01:41:51;01:41:52;"The way the story ends"
01:41:52;01:41:56;"They came on the scene with ""Too late to apologize"""
01:41:56;01:41:57;"Used to be a fool"
01:41:57;01:42:04;"And the singer, Ryan Tedder, is, like, a really big songwriter, too"
01:42:04;01:42:07;"You ain't even trying to make me jealous"
01:42:07;01:42:09;"Ten songwriters credited"
01:42:09;01:42:10;"You can't help it"
01:42:10;01:42:15;"So this is One Republic's chosen song from season one finale to the NBC show ""Songland"""
01:42:15;01:42:20;"I guess there was, like, a reality show about songwriters?"
01:42:20;01:42:26;"So, wait, so they go over songs that are submitted by the contestants of the show"
01:42:26;01:42:28;"and perform them?"
01:42:28;01:42:31;"I guess the guy J.T. Roach was a contestant on the show"
01:42:31;01:42:35;"Well, this is how Ryan Tedder introduced the song at Red Rocks and said,"
01:42:35;01:42:40;"""The next song we collaborated on, we found it from a middle school basketball coach in California"
01:42:40;01:42:43;"who co-wrote this, and then we finished it with him"""
01:42:43;01:42:45;"That's a cool story"
01:42:45;01:42:49;"Middle school basketball coach entered the contest or the show"
01:42:49;01:42:51;"That's pretty Pollard"
01:42:51;01:42:52;"Yeah"
01:42:52;01:42:55;"I don't want you to be lonely"
01:42:55;01:43:00;"But right now I'm the only one who feels this way"
01:43:00;01:43:04;"And I ain't even trying to make you miss me"
01:43:04;01:43:06;"Make you miss me"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"I know a history"
01:43:08;01:43:11;"But it kills me to know that you found"
01:43:11;01:43:13;"Somebody to love"
01:43:15;01:43:19;"Tell me how can I go on without"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"Somebody to love"
01:43:23;01:43:25;"Bro, this was just released"
01:43:25;01:43:27;"Brand new"
01:43:27;01:43:30;"One Republic is a funny band name"
01:43:30;01:43:36;"Reminds me of, like, some, like, offshoot of, like, Banana Republic's new clothing line"
01:43:36;01:43:38;"One Republic?"
01:43:38;01:43:39;"I don't know"
01:43:39;01:43:42;"It wouldn't shock me if there's a band called One Republic and they sounded like Tool"
01:43:42;01:43:43;"Oh, totally"
01:43:43;01:43:44;"Yeah, it sounds heavy"
01:43:44;01:43:50;"It also has, like, that kind of, like, Muse, like, One World Government kind of vibe"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"Do not trust them"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"They want you to conform"
01:43:54;01:43:56;"One Republic"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"Have you heard that new Tool album, by the way?"
01:43:58;01:44:01;"I heard the first, that 11-minute single"
01:44:01;01:44:02;"I haven't heard it"
01:44:02;01:44:03;"I thought it was pretty tight"
01:44:03;01:44:07;"But I've seen on Twitter a few times, like, apparently it's selling like gangbusters"
01:44:07;01:44:13;"Yeah, Tool's new album, I believe it's called Fear Inoculum, is now the biggest"
01:44:13;01:44:19;"Well, it went number one the week it came out, making it the biggest sales week for a rock album this year"
01:44:19;01:44:26;"And I'm pretty sure the album that previously held that honor, Father of the Bride by Vampire Weekend"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"And you guys just got stomped by Tool"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"We got stomped by Tool, a real rock band"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"We gotta look that shit up at the end of the year"
01:44:32;01:44:37;"Just be like, the five biggest, like, debuts in rock this year"
01:44:37;01:44:40;"Tool, Vampire Weekend"
01:44:40;01:44:44;"Maybe some other shit knocked us off"
01:44:44;01:44:49;"Post Malone, no, technically Post Malone is the number one biggest rock debut"
01:44:49;01:44:50;"Is he, like, is he?"
01:44:50;01:44:52;"He's got Ozzy Osbourne, so"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"No, no, they probably don't count him as rock"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"Anyway, shout out to Tool"
01:44:56;01:44:58;"Us rock bands gotta stick together"
01:44:58;01:45:00;"Look, man, it's all love"
01:45:00;01:45:01;"It's all love"
01:45:01;01:45:06;"The number one song this week in 1992, this is a classic"
01:45:06;01:45:07;"Boyz II Men, End of the Road"
01:45:07;01:45:10;"Also Babyface, man, they had three songs"
01:45:10;01:45:13;"1992 is huge for Babyface and L.A. Rude"
01:45:13;01:45:27;"I think I talked about it on the show that last summer we played a festival in the UK called End of the Road"
01:45:27;01:45:28;"That's right"
01:45:28;01:45:30;"And Baio chose to play this song, it's our walk-off music"
01:45:30;01:45:34;"I was, like, wondering how many people in the UK know this, like, old Boyz II Men song"
01:45:34;01:45:39;"And then I was, like, walking to the trailer, I heard, like, 10,000 people, like"
01:45:39;01:45:42;"To the end of the road"
01:45:42;01:45:43;"That's awesome"
01:45:43;01:45:50;"It's released on the soundtrack for the 1992 Eddie Murphy comedy Boomerang"
01:45:50;01:45:51;"You ever see that movie?"
01:45:51;01:45:53;"I don't think I did"
01:45:53;01:45:55;"They're making a TV show of it"
01:45:55;01:45:57;"Uh, no"
01:45:57;01:45:58;"With Eddie Murphy in it?"
01:45:58;01:46:01;"I don't think so, just, like, uh, taking the plot"
01:46:01;01:46:03;"Grace Jones is in that movie"
01:46:03;01:46:05;"Oh, yeah, you know what, I have seen parts of it"
01:46:05;01:46:07;"He's, like, an advertising exec or something"
01:46:07;01:46:08;"That's right"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"She does, like, a perfume ad"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"Yeah, I think her character's name is Stranger, right?"
01:46:12;01:46:13;"Right"
01:46:13;01:46:15;"It's, uh, it's an amazing movie"
01:46:15;01:46:17;"Yeah, I've heard people love it"
01:46:17;01:46:18;"Yeah, Stranger, yeah"
01:46:18;01:46:25;"And the name of the perfume that she, you know, she creates as the model is, uh, Afterbirth"
01:46:25;01:46:27;"[laughs]"
01:46:27;01:46:33;"Although we go to the end of the road"
01:46:33;01:46:38;"Still I can't let it go"
01:46:38;01:46:41;"It's unnatural"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"You belong to me"
01:46:43;01:46:46;"I belong to you"
01:46:46;01:46:52;"Go to the end of the road"
01:46:52;01:46:55;"So this is a breakup song?"
01:46:55;01:46:59;"Yeah, but it's Can't Let Go"
01:46:59;01:47:01;"It's unnatural, is that what you're saying?"
01:47:01;01:47:02;"I think"
01:47:02;01:47:04;"It's unnatural"
01:47:04;01:47:07;"I think he's saying we came to the end of the road, but I can't do it"
01:47:07;01:47:08;"Yeah"
01:47:08;01:47:11;"We came to the EOTR"
01:47:11;01:47:15;"This, this sounds more mutual, though, as opposed to the"
01:47:15;01:47:17;"Let me check out these lyrics"
01:47:17;01:47:20;"You've never been there before"
01:47:20;01:47:24;"It's only your first time"
01:47:24;01:47:29;"Just during the break we were talking about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"
01:47:29;01:47:32;"New film, came out three months ago"
01:47:32;01:47:35;"Finally getting around to talking about it on TC"
01:47:35;01:47:39;"But we were talking about, one moment that we both liked a lot"
01:47:39;01:47:44;"Is that whole sequence of when, um, DiCaprio and Pitt are coming back from Italy"
01:47:44;01:47:47;"And we're saying, like, I love how they use that Rolling Stones song"
01:47:47;01:47:52;"And I remember there's, there's like a line in the narration that goes like"
01:47:52;01:47:55;"What do you do, what do you do when you come to the end of the road?"
01:47:55;01:47:56;"It's something like about"
01:47:56;01:47:57;"Yeah, with an old buddy"
01:47:57;01:48:00;"With an old buddy who's less than a wife and a little more than a brother"
01:48:00;01:48:01;"Something like that"
01:48:01;01:48:02;"Yeah"
01:48:02;01:48:05;"And I feel like, maybe it doesn't say end of the road, but"
01:48:05;01:48:07;"It's such a funny phrase"
01:48:07;01:48:10;"There's also that part where DiCaprio says to Brad Pitt, like"
01:48:11;01:48:15;"Well, well old buddy, looks like we've come to the end of the trail or something"
01:48:15;01:48:16;"Yeah"
01:48:16;01:48:20;"Is that when they go to the Mexican restaurant in the valley and get hammered?"
01:48:20;01:48:22;"This might be right before that, yeah"
01:48:22;01:48:25;"I guess end of the road is a common phrase"
01:48:25;01:48:28;"And if you're kind of, uh, if you're from the wild west"
01:48:28;01:48:32;"Or a cowboy, or acting cowboy movies, you can say end of the trail"
01:48:32;01:48:34;"Looks like the trail ends here"
01:48:34;01:48:39;"Well, looks like we're at the end of the trail"
01:48:40;01:48:41;"Yep, we're at the end of the road"
01:48:41;01:48:42;"Yep"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"End of the trail"
01:48:44;01:48:46;"Well, you say trail, I say road"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"That's why we're here"
01:48:48;01:48:54;"That's like a wild west dude breaking up with his New York girlfriend"
01:48:54;01:48:57;"We're at the end of the trail"
01:48:57;01:48:59;"Yeah, we're at the end of the road"
01:48:59;01:49:00;"Shawn Mendes says trail"
01:49:00;01:49:03;"Bieber says road"
01:49:03;01:49:05;"Well, where's Shawn Mendes from?"
01:49:05;01:49:09;"Is he from a more, like a more like classically Canadian"
01:49:09;01:49:12;"They're both from pretty, they're both from Ontario I think, Shawn"
01:49:12;01:49:13;"They're just both from the burbs?"
01:49:13;01:49:15;"Yeah, Shawn Mendes"
01:49:15;01:49:19;"From, oh, there you go, yeah"
01:49:19;01:49:23;"Oh, it says he was born in Toronto, but he didn't grow up there"
01:49:23;01:49:26;"Yeah, Pickering, home town Pickering"
01:49:26;01:49:27;"City boy"
01:49:27;01:49:28;"And then where's Bieber from?"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"Stratford"
01:49:30;01:49:33;"Do you have any sense of the differences between Pickering and Stratford?"
01:49:33;01:49:34;"Uh, no"
01:49:35;01:49:36;"Not really"
01:49:36;01:49:38;"I think we're both the same size"
01:49:38;01:49:58;"I do love, that's such a standout part of the song is the fact that they say it's unnatural"
01:49:58;01:50:02;"It's such like a, it's a good, like memorable songwriting"
01:50:03;01:50:05;"It's unnatural"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"Maybe that's where I got it from, Cape Cod"
01:50:07;01:50:09;"I said it feels so unnatural"
01:50:09;01:50:12;"Subconsciously"
01:50:12;01:50:16;"I was synthesizing some Peter Gabriel and some Boyz II Men"
01:50:16;01:50:19;"It's just a damn good word"
01:50:19;01:50:25;"It's unnatural"
01:50:25;01:50:28;"Do you remember that Katy Perry song, Unconditional?"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"No"
01:50:30;01:50:33;"It's like this ballad she put out maybe like four years ago"
01:50:33;01:50:37;"The delivery of that word, it's very unusual the way she"
01:50:37;01:50:39;"Unconditional"
01:50:39;01:50:42;"I don't, yeah, I've never heard that, Unconditional"
01:50:42;01:50:44;"Or is it Unconditionally?"
01:50:44;01:50:46;"Maybe, there's a song called Unconditionally"
01:50:46;01:50:48;"Yeah, let's listen to the chorus of that one"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"Okay, so she says both"
01:51:00;01:51:02;"Unconditional"
01:51:02;01:51:04;"That's very musical theater"
01:51:04;01:51:07;"Yeah, very formal enunciation"
01:51:07;01:51:10;"Unconditional"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"That sounds like it could be a song from Hamilton"
01:51:12;01:51:17;"Alexander, we need to vote on the amendment now"
01:51:17;01:51:19;"I don't like the language"
01:51:19;01:51:24;"The legal ramifications of the word Unconditional"
01:51:24;01:51:27;"Unconditional"
01:51:28;01:51:30;"That's, yeah, it's so musical theater"
01:51:30;01:51:33;"And what is this word, Unconditional?"
01:51:33;01:51:36;"Unconditional"
01:51:36;01:51:40;"How could I sign a document saying this?"
01:51:40;01:51:41;"Unconditional"
01:51:41;01:51:45;"Unconditional"
01:51:45;01:51:48;"Unconditional"
01:51:48;01:51:50;"Shout out to Katy Perry"
01:51:50;01:51:54;"The number one song on iTunes right now, Craig Morgan, country"
01:51:54;01:51:58;"It's called The Father, My Son, and the Holy Ghost"
01:51:58;01:52:00;"What?"
01:52:00;01:52:01;"Okay, well, hold on"
01:52:01;01:52:03;"This is one of those ones where I'm glad I'm looking at the paper"
01:52:03;01:52:05;"Because before we say anything about this song"
01:52:05;01:52:08;"It's very important to know that this song is about the loss of his son"
01:52:08;01:52:11;"Who drowned at the age of 19 while tubing with friends"
01:52:11;01:52:14;"Jesus, I almost don't want to listen to it, that's so sad"
01:52:14;01:52:15;"That's so dark"
01:52:15;01:52:18;"What a f***ing age to die, Jesus"
01:52:18;01:52:19;"I know"
01:52:19;01:52:20;"To lose a son who's 19"
01:52:20;01:52:21;"Oh, God"
01:52:21;01:52:23;"Okay, I guess we gotta listen to it"
01:52:23;01:52:28;"But it's such a sad backstory, good Lord"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"Lights are shining bright"
01:52:30;01:52:34;"As always downtown on the road"
01:52:34;01:52:38;"I have friends that come from out of town"
01:52:38;01:52:40;"Asking me to go"
01:52:40;01:52:44;"They say there's so much going on"
01:52:44;01:52:49;"Why don't you come along and show us around?"
01:52:51;01:52:55;"I tell them Karen's not feeling well"
01:52:55;01:52:58;"So I probably shouldn't go out"
01:52:58;01:53:02;"Besides, I've got a fixed list of things"
01:53:02;01:53:05;"I need to do around the house"
01:53:05;01:53:09;"Then I hang up the phone"
01:53:09;01:53:14;"Turn the radio back on and sit back down"
01:53:15;01:53:21;"I know my boy ain't here but he ain't gone"
01:53:21;01:53:25;"In the mornings I wake up"
01:53:25;01:53:29;"Give her a kiss, head to the kitchen"
01:53:29;01:53:33;"Pour a cup, wake me up"
01:53:33;01:53:36;"And try to rouse up some ambition"
01:53:36;01:53:39;"Go outside, sit by myself"
01:53:39;01:53:42;"But I ain't home"
01:53:42;01:53:50;"I've got the father, my son, and the homeless"
01:53:50;01:53:57;"I've been beat up, I've been pushed and shoved"
01:53:57;01:54:00;"But never ever really knocked down"
01:54:00;01:54:04;"Between Mom and Dad, Uncle Sam and friends"
01:54:04;01:54:07;"I somehow always pulled out"
01:54:07;01:54:10;"But the pain of this was more"
01:54:10;01:54:13;"Than I'd ever felt before"
01:54:13;01:54:16;"Yeah, I was broke"
01:54:17;01:54:20;"I cried and cried and cried"
01:54:20;01:54:23;"Until I found my home"
01:54:23;01:54:27;"And I prayed and prayed and prayed"
01:54:27;01:54:30;"I cried and cried and cried"
01:54:30;01:54:34;"And the man in my head"
01:54:34;01:54:38;"Day by day, he musters some ambition"
01:54:38;01:54:41;"Get me home"
01:54:41;01:54:44;"I know my boy ain't here"
01:54:44;01:54:47;"But he ain't gone"
01:54:47;01:54:51;"In the mornings I wake up"
01:54:51;01:54:55;"Give her a kiss, head to the kitchen"
01:54:55;01:54:58;"Pour a cup, wake me up"
01:54:58;01:55:01;"And try to rouse up some ambition"
01:55:01;01:55:05;"Go outside, sit by myself"
01:55:05;01:55:08;"But I ain't home"
01:55:08;01:55:13;"I've got the father, my son, and the homeless"
01:55:13;01:55:16;"Well, I'm not sure what he means by ""I have the father"""
01:55:16;01:55:19;"I know my love, I pray, I cry"
01:55:19;01:55:23;"I hear a little more each day inside"
01:55:23;01:55:29;"I won't completely heal 'til I go home"
01:55:29;01:55:35;"In the mornings I wake up"
01:55:35;01:55:40;"Give her a kiss, head to the kitchen"
01:55:40;01:55:43;"Pour a cup, wake me up"
01:55:43;01:55:46;"And try to rouse up some ambition"
01:55:46;01:55:49;"Go outside, sit by myself"
01:55:49;01:55:52;"Did you ever hear that Mount Erie record called ""A Crow Looked At Me""?"
01:55:52;01:55:57;"'Cause the guy from Mount Erie's wife died very young"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"No, I haven't heard that one"
01:55:59;01:56:00;"It's incredible"
01:56:00;01:56:02;"It's about his bad grieving"
01:56:02;01:56:09;"Yeah, it's like a very detail-oriented, like, narrative record"
01:56:09;01:56:12;"about, like, the immediate grieving process"
01:56:12;01:56:14;"Yeah, no, I haven't heard it"
01:56:14;01:56:15;"It's incredible"
01:56:15;01:56:16;"It's tough"
01:56:16;01:56:18;"I mean, it's not something you're, like, throwing on a lot"
01:56:18;01:56:20;"Right, right, yeah"
01:56:20;01:56:21;"It must be heavy"
01:56:21;01:56:29;"We went and saw him, Phil is his name, play at the L.A. Cemetery"
01:56:29;01:56:30;"What's that called?"
01:56:30;01:56:31;"Oh, the mausoleum kind of area?"
01:56:31;01:56:33;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, at the Forever Cemetery"
01:56:33;01:56:36;"It was, like, not a dry eye in the house"
01:56:36;01:56:39;"Obviously, condolences to Craig Morgan"
01:56:39;01:56:42;"Good for you, turning your grief into art"
01:56:42;01:56:45;"All right, let's try to end on a more up note"
01:56:45;01:56:47;"Jake, how are the Mets doing this year?"
01:56:47;01:56:49;"Wrong guy to ask"
01:56:49;01:56:52;"There was a good listener email"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"We got an email"
01:56:54;01:56:57;"To 8minutecapecod@gmail.com, by the way"
01:56:57;01:56:58;"That's the numeral 8"
01:56:58;01:56:59;"Yeah, okay"
01:56:59;01:57:00;"If you want to hit us up"
01:57:00;01:57:03;"Hello, I'm Richard Maista"
01:57:03;01:57:06;"I would like you to help me install sod in my front yard of my house"
01:57:06;01:57:08;"And I hope you can do a good job"
01:57:08;01:57:09;"End of email"
01:57:09;01:57:10;"Interesting"
01:57:10;01:57:13;"So, he thinks maybe we're going to get into landscaping"
01:57:13;01:57:15;"Or he thought he was, I don't know what"
01:57:15;01:57:20;"Maybe he just hit the wrong, maybe, like, 9minutecapecod is a landscaper"
01:57:20;01:57:22;"I was thinking 8minutecape sod"
01:57:22;01:57:23;"Oh, maybe"
01:57:23;01:57:25;"Might have been what he was meaning to hit"
01:57:25;01:57:27;"Tough to lay sod in 8 minutes"
01:57:27;01:57:28;"Maybe you should write back"
01:57:28;01:57:29;"That's..."
01:57:29;01:57:32;"I mean..."
01:57:32;01:57:33;"8minutelaid sod?"
01:57:33;01:57:35;"Yeah, I mean..."
01:57:35;01:57:36;"It goes fast"
01:57:36;01:57:39;"You could do it in an afternoon, but not 8 minutes"
01:57:39;01:57:40;"Look at the keyboard"
01:57:40;01:57:42;"The S is pretty far from the G"
01:57:42;01:57:44;"So you'd have to be wasted"
01:57:44;01:57:45;"Okay, maybe he's just trolling us"
01:57:45;01:57:48;"Well, Seinfeld, can you hit him back and just be like"
01:57:48;01:57:50;"Hey, I think you got the wrong email"
01:57:50;01:57:53;"This is the email for Internet Radio Show Time Crisis"
01:57:53;01:57:55;"We don't do that kind of stuff"
01:57:55;01:57:56;"Yeah"
01:57:56;01:57:58;"Yeah, I'll hit him up"
01:57:58;01:58:00;"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought this was..."
01:58:00;01:58:05;"8minutelaid sod is a local Tulsa sod company"
01:58:05;01:58:06;"Very quick service"
01:58:06;01:58:07;"Not very good"
01:58:07;01:58:11;"[Laughter]"
01:58:11;01:58:12;"Alright"
01:58:12;01:58:14;"Another TC in the can"
