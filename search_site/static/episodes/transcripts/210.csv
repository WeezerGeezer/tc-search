00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:06;"On this week's episode,"
00:06;00:12;"we talk about the Oscars and all things showbiz."
00:12;00:15;"Flamin' Hot, The Fire Inside,"
00:15;00:21;"plus we're joined by Zachary and Christian of The Octopus Murders."
00:21;00:26;"All that plus the top five hits of 1991."
00:26;00:29;"Today on Time Crisis."
00:29;00:31;"With Ezra Koenig."
00:36;00:42;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:42;00:49;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:49;00:56;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:56;01:03;"And so I dealt you the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:03;01:08;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:08;01:14;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:14;01:18;"We were only there"
01:18;01:20;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:20;01:22;"Seinfeld is stuck in traffic."
01:22;01:24;"What up, Jake? What up, Nick?"
01:24;01:26;"Hey, let's just get right into it."
01:26;01:29;"Big weekend this past weekend, Oscar weekend."
01:29;01:31;"That's right."
01:31;01:34;"We were all watching, because we're all big Oscars heads."
01:34;01:37;"Are you a big Oscars head? You're serious?"
01:37;01:38;"I wouldn't say I'm a head, but I'm a fan."
01:38;01:41;"I generally will watch the show."
01:41;01:44;"And by watch, I mean it'll be on and I'll be in and out of the room."
01:44;01:45;"Yeah."
01:45;01:50;"I'm not going to like, rewind if I miss like Robert Downey's speech."
01:50;01:53;"Like, oh, I missed the speech? Okay, I missed the speech."
01:53;01:54;"I mean, but how far are you going?"
01:54;01:58;"Are you doing like themed food at your home?"
01:58;02:00;"Do you have a pool?"
02:00;02:00;"No."
02:00;02:04;"Jake's special nuclear salsa for Oppenheimer kind of thing?"
02:04;02:10;"I wish I had that kind of time to plan and execute an Oscar party."
02:10;02:11;"I don't."
02:11;02:13;"It was absolutely chaotic."
02:13;02:15;"We had a few people over last minute."
02:15;02:17;"There were four three-year-olds there."
02:17;02:18;"Oh boy."
02:18;02:20;"So it was chaos."
02:20;02:20;"It was great."
02:20;02:26;"But you were texting us during the, I forget who sang it,"
02:26;02:30;"but someone sang a song from the Flamin' Hot soundtrack."
02:30;02:31;"Yes. We got to throw that on by the way,"
02:31;02:35;"because we should have talked about this earlier that Flamin' Hot,"
02:35;02:38;"the Richard Montaigne story, the film we've talked about,"
02:38;02:42;"about the creation of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, allegedly,"
02:42;02:45;"was nominated for one Oscar and that was her best song."
02:45;02:49;"The song was performed by Becky G."
02:49;02:51;"The song is called ""The Fire Inside."""
02:51;02:53;"Was it written by Diane Warren?"
02:53;02:58;"And was it written originally for the Flamin' Hot Cheetos movie?"
02:58;03:01;"Or was it an older song that they were like,"
03:01;03:04;"""Oh, that'll work thematically with what we're going for."""
03:04;03:05;"No, no, no. It's an original."
03:05;03:07;"It has to be original to be nominated."
03:07;03:13;"My understanding, because I was watching the Oscars with a few people,"
03:13;03:17;"one of which is, I think, a very well-known producer."
03:17;03:18;"And he said that..."
03:18;03:19;"Okay, name drop."
03:19;03:21;"He said that Diane..."
03:21;03:23;"I don't want a name drop because I don't know if this is..."
03:23;03:25;"I don't think that..."
03:25;03:25;"Okay."
03:25;03:28;"He did not produce this, but he said that Diane Warren"
03:28;03:34;"is the person you hire specifically to get an Oscar-nominated..."
03:34;03:35;"Song."
03:35;03:40;"A song where it has no connection at all to the movie itself."
03:40;03:41;"Do you know what I mean?"
03:41;03:43;"It's just sort of like you hire them to..."
03:43;03:45;"Or hire her for that."
03:45;03:50;"That's a pretty cynical take, but I guess there are elements of"
03:50;03:53;"wheeling and dealing in Hollywood."
03:53;03:54;"Oh, here comes Seinfeld."
03:54;03:55;"Seinfeld, welcome to the program."
03:55;04:00;"We're discussing the Flamin' Hot Cheetos Oscar-nominated song."
04:00;04:04;"Oh, yeah, the Diane Warren written song."
04:04;04:04;"You're not missing a beat."
04:04;04:05;"You're right in there."
04:05;04:08;"It's hearing that if you want to get your song nominated,"
04:08;04:14;"you get Diane Warren, and that's a way that a movie can kind of"
04:14;04:17;"almost be guaranteed one Oscar-nom, even if it's..."
04:17;04:23;"And frankly, I could see best actor for the guy who played Richard Montanez."
04:23;04:28;"And I do think Avalon Goria, it is a great first film."
04:28;04:31;"Was there Oscar buzz?"
04:31;04:31;"I don't know."
04:31;04:35;"This was like a pretty slammed year with Oppenheimer and Barbie."
04:35;04:38;"Tony Shalhoub absolutely crushed that role, too."
04:38;04:39;"It should have more noms."
04:39;04:45;"But okay, so by hiring Diane Warren, who's kind of a legendary songwriter"
04:45;04:49;"and has been nominated and won many, many Oscars, I bet her name"
04:49;04:56;"carries a lot of weight in the voting block for best song at the Oscars."
04:56;05:00;"And I could see that maybe somebody else is, you know, who's voting,"
05:00;05:03;"is looking through and they're like, ""Flamin' Hot? What's that?"""
05:03;05:05;"Oh, Diane Warren wrote the song? I'll vote for it."
05:15;05:16;"Sounds like a hit."
05:24;05:26;"Diane Warren is 67 years old."
05:26;05:28;"I'm going to assume that she didn't produce the song."
05:28;05:32;"She just wrote the chords and the lyrics?"
05:32;05:36;"Yeah, this is produced by Ismael Cano Jr."
05:39;05:43;"By the way, Diane Warren has never won an Oscar."
05:43;05:43;"Really?"
05:43;05:45;"But has been nominated."
05:45;05:49;"Wow. That's like Scorsese numbers."
05:49;05:51;"Didn't she write ""My Heart Will Go On""?"
06:06;06:08;"You got the fire."
06:08;06:13;"By the way, I believe this is in the pot."
06:13;06:18;"Diane Warren gets dragged sometimes for attaching her awards-bait power ballads"
06:18;06:21;"to random movies in pursuit of an Oscar."
06:21;06:24;"So that checks out. That's what this guy told me."
06:24;06:27;"Okay, well, this year she did not choose a random movie."
06:27;06:33;"She chose the time crisis movie of the year, so okay, but go on."
06:33;06:37;"I guess my point being she had no other affiliation, you know, to this movie other than—"
06:37;06:41;"It's not like friend of the show, Mark Ronson, you know, doing all of Barbie or something."
06:41;06:45;"You know, they hire this woman to do probably a credit song."
06:45;06:48;"Actually, do you know when in the movie does a song come up?"
06:48;06:51;"First of all, I love Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt."
06:51;06:56;"They wrote ""I'm Just Ken"" and they produced the whole Barbie soundtrack."
06:56;07:02;"But I don't know if those guys have a more—a deeper connection with Barbie dolls"
07:02;07:05;"than Diane Warren has with Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
07:05;07:07;"No, but they—"
07:07;07:08;"I'm willing to believe—hold on, hold on."
07:08;07:09;"Really fair point, Ezra."
07:09;07:14;"I'm willing to believe that it's more recent that Diane Warren bought a bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos"
07:14;07:16;"than Mark Ronson bought a Barbie."
07:16;07:18;"More visceral connection."
07:18;07:23;"I will say, you know, and I feel like you guys experienced this as well maybe,"
07:23;07:26;"but I watched Flamin' Hot more than once."
07:26;07:28;"I watched it like one and a half times."
07:28;07:30;"Not until that Oscars performance."
07:30;07:35;"Like, I feel like I'd never heard that song one time before I saw it at the Academy Awards."
07:35;07:36;"Credit sequence?"
07:36;07:38;"Yeah, maybe it's just at the end."
07:38;07:41;"Yeah, it's second song in the credit sequence."
07:41;07:43;"Okay, yeah, there you go."
07:43;07:47;"That's what I mean about not having a real connection."
07:47;07:50;"I've seen Flamin' Hot over 20 times."
07:50;07:54;"I've had this song on my gym workout playlist since then."
07:54;08:00;"I almost always kick off and end my workout with the fire inside."
08:00;08:02;"You book and you start and finish with it?"
08:02;08:03;"Yep."
08:03;08:04;"Okay."
08:04;08:06;"Wait, actually, I wonder if anybody--"
08:06;08:08;"Actually, it would be a good song for a gym playlist."
08:08;08:11;"Oh, totally. It would be great for a Peloton class."
08:11;08:12;"I wonder if anybody ever pitched--"
08:12;08:14;"You got the fire inside."
08:14;08:20;"Yeah, I wonder if anybody ever pitched like a Flamin' Hot Peloton class"
08:20;08:24;"where they have like an all red background"
08:24;08:28;"and the teacher uses songs from the movie,"
08:28;08:32;"such as The Fire Inside, Becky G."
08:32;08:35;"Because you could totally see how a fitness instructor could be like,"
08:35;08:37;"""All right, guys, we're going to work today."
08:37;08:40;"We're going to work as hard as Richard Montanez"
08:40;08:43;"when he was a Frito-Lay janitor."""
08:43;08:45;"And kind of like, ""Okay, we're going to go up our first hill."""
08:45;08:48;"This reminds me of the part in Flamin' Hot"
08:48;08:51;"when Montanez first gets the job"
08:51;08:54;"and he wants to learn more about how the factory works."
08:54;08:56;"But some of the guys are like, ""Hey, stick to being a janitor."""
08:56;08:58;"But are we going to let that stop us?"
08:58;09:00;"Did it stop Richard Montanez? No."
09:00;09:01;"Okay, pound it out."
09:01;09:03;"I think these things actually happen."
09:03;09:06;"This is the part where he steals himself to cold call Tony Shalhoub."
09:06;09:08;"[laughs]"
09:08;09:11;"Okay, I know you probably feel like you're out of gas,"
09:11;09:15;"but think about the courage that Richard Montanez needed"
09:15;09:18;"to cold call Tony Shalhoub."
09:18;09:20;"And I want you to take that knob"
09:20;09:24;"and take three big Richard Montanez spins to the right"
09:24;09:30;"because we're going to cold call Tony Shalhoub right now."
09:30;09:32;"And then, I mean, it's perfect."
09:32;09:34;"I'm entering the number."
09:34;09:36;"Oh, Tony Shalhoub pops in the thing."
09:36;09:38;"I pulled the number off the break room wall."
09:38;09:40;"They get Tony to make a cameo?"
09:40;09:44;"Yeah, and then Tony Shalhoub walks in and the class is freaking out."
09:44;09:47;"And then it's saying like, ""Yeah, you can make all sorts of great jokes about it."""
09:47;09:50;"Now, some of us do we occasionally go a little bit too hard"
09:50;09:51;"on the Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
09:51;09:54;"Guilty as charged. It's an amazing snack."
09:54;09:57;"And that's why we're going to do one more climb."
09:57;09:59;"You got the fire inside."
09:59;10:01;"Let's not lose the main thread here, though."
10:01;10:03;"So the Oscars are happening."
10:03;10:05;"Ezra hits the TC thread."
10:05;10:08;"He goes, ""I'm at the Vanity Fair dinner."""
10:08;10:10;"Is that what you were at? The dinner? Pre-party."
10:10;10:11;"Yeah."
10:11;10:15;"And you're like, ""I'm the only one at my table that has seen Flamin' Hot."""
10:15;10:19;"Yes. I was actually really glad that my background"
10:19;10:24;"as an investigative journalist along with you guys on TC"
10:24;10:26;"gave me some interesting dinner party conversation"
10:26;10:31;"because I'm at a very high-class Hollywood event."
10:31;10:33;"As often happens at those events,"
10:33;10:35;"you don't know who you're going to be sitting with"
10:35;10:37;"and they split up couples."
10:37;10:40;"Oh, I like that. I like that."
10:40;10:42;"I think that's how it should be always."
10:42;10:44;"I really appreciate that too."
10:44;10:47;"Even if you, on the occasion, go to dinner party"
10:47;10:49;"and say, ""Couples split up."""
10:49;10:51;"Because then it forces people to turn to each other and be like,"
10:51;10:54;"""Oh, hey, how are you doing?"" You meet people, you know what I mean?"
10:54;10:56;"So who are you seated with?"
10:56;10:58;"I don't know if I want to..."
10:58;11:00;"If you don't mind us... Okay, you don't want to..."
11:00;11:02;"Well, I could say, you know, some of them are celebrities."
11:02;11:06;"Some are some big-name people who have been big in TV and movies."
11:06;11:11;"There's a really cool choreographer who I really enjoyed speaking with"
11:11;11:13;"and a director he works with."
11:13;11:17;"Are you worried about naming them because you don't want to out them"
11:17;11:20;"as having never seen Flamin' Hot?"
11:20;11:22;"For all I know, it could get awkward."
11:22;11:27;"For all I know, this guy's doing a deal with Richard Montanya next week."
11:27;11:29;"I don't know."
11:29;11:31;"They're private people."
11:31;11:33;"I will say, I'll just give you one person."
11:33;11:37;"She was very nice and cool, but I was sitting next to Jeff Goldblum's wife,"
11:37;11:40;"Emily, a very friendly person"
11:40;11:45;"and a very talented kind of dancer, acrobat person."
11:45;11:47;"She had a really cool backstory."
11:47;11:51;"Anyway, sitting with a mix of people like that"
11:51;11:57;"and, you know, so I'm sitting across the table from Rashida,"
11:57;12:01;"so I can't rely on her to keep the conversation going,"
12:01;12:03;"so I'm just talking to everybody."
12:03;12:05;"Everybody was super cool."
12:05;12:07;"So, you know, they have the show on at this party,"
12:07;12:10;"so it's not the ideal way to watch the show"
12:10;12:12;"because, of course, there's dinner conversation happening,"
12:12;12:16;"but people quiet down when they're about to announce one of the awards."
12:16;12:18;"And then, of course, there's a lot of talk."
12:18;12:20;"""Okay, everybody, who do you think is going to win?"""
12:20;12:21;"That kind of stuff."
12:21;12:24;"But, you know, as you can imagine,"
12:24;12:28;"during the musical performances, there's people sometimes who are talking."
12:28;12:32;"And so during the Becky G ""Fire Inside"" performance,"
12:32;12:36;"I kind of realized, ""Okay, this is something I might have some unique insight into."""
12:36;12:40;"So I said, ""Have any of you guys seen the movie that this is from?"""
12:40;12:42;"And not a single person at the table had."
12:42;12:44;"And I said, ""Oh, it's from 'Flame It Hot.'"""
12:44;12:46;"Had they heard of the movie?"
12:46;12:48;"Seemingly none of them had."
12:48;12:51;"And I said, ""Oh, it's about the development of the Flame It Hot Cheetos."""
12:51;12:52;"And they said, ""Oh, really?"""
12:52;12:55;"And then I think maybe somebody was like, ""Oh, yeah, I heard Eva Longoria directed that."""
12:55;12:56;"And I was like, ""Yeah, you guys should watch it."""
12:56;12:57;"And they're like, ""Is it good?"""
12:57;12:59;"And I was like, ""Yeah, it's pretty good, actually. You should watch it."""
12:59;13:02;"And I was like, ""You know the whole story about Richard Montanez"
13:02;13:06;"and he said that he invented Flame It Hot Cheetos and they didn't know."""
13:06;13:10;"And then they were like, ""Oh, no."""
13:10;13:13;"I'm picturing Rashida's very crestfallen expression"
13:13;13:19;"as Trent enters into minute 15 in his recap of Flame It Hot."
13:19;13:22;"Here he goes again."
13:22;13:26;"Once he gets started on Flame It Hot, this is the VF dinner, not the TC dinner."
13:26;13:28;"Just kicking him to the table."
13:28;13:33;"They seemed to enjoy the fact that I was a passionate Flame It Hot researcher"
13:33;13:38;"and I did gently rib the table."
13:38;13:41;"I said, ""So nobody's seen the movie?"""
13:41;13:43;"And everybody's like, ""No, no, I haven't seen it."""
13:43;13:47;"And then I said, ""Well, I guess I'm the only cinephile here."""
13:47;13:50;"Sick burn."
13:50;13:58;"I haven't seen Zone of Interest, but I have seen Flame It Hot."
13:58;14:04;"As you stare into Jeff Goldblum's eyes."
14:04;14:08;"I should have just run up to him a few hours later at the party."
14:08;14:10;"""Jeffrey, so are you going to check out Flame It Hot?"""
14:10;14:14;"He's like, ""What? What are you talking about? Do you remember earlier I said?"""
14:14;14:17;"He's like, ""No, I don't remember."""
14:17;14:18;"That rules."
14:18;14:21;"The friend of the show, Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt,"
14:21;14:24;"they really brought the house down with I'm Just Cat."
14:24;14:25;"Yeah."
14:25;14:26;"What did you think, Jake?"
14:26;14:30;"Yeah, it was great. I mean, it was a great choreographed piece of entertainment."
14:30;14:32;"It was great."
14:32;14:36;"Gosling had a nice kind of rasp to his voice."
14:36;14:38;"I mean, do I like the song? Not really."
14:38;14:43;"But in the context of an Oscars broadcast, did you see the movie?"
14:43;14:46;"It was great. Yeah, I saw the movie. It was all right."
14:46;14:49;"I wasn't like blown away by it."
14:49;14:51;"I think he crushed it."
14:51;14:55;"I think that it was so fun what they did for a performance."
14:55;14:59;"And I really think that a huge problem with the Flame It Hot performance is how--"
14:59;15:03;"and I think one of you guys said it-- it was just so over the text."
15:03;15:06;"It was bizarre how self-serious it was."
15:06;15:09;"The kids coming out. I mean, let's have some fun, guys."
15:09;15:11;"I mean, it's just the Cheetos movie."
15:11;15:15;"They should have had Richard Montanya's riff of like a pretend guitar solo."
15:15;15:17;"That's what I'm saying. That would have been great."
15:17;15:19;"Should have had Slash come back out."
15:19;15:20;"Or bring-- oh."
15:20;15:22;"Slash is already there."
15:22;15:24;"Or Bob Seger, since he did the original."
15:24;15:27;"Bob Seger has a song called ""Fire Inside."" It's not the same song."
15:27;15:28;"Throw that on."
15:28;15:29;"It's a cover, right?"
15:29;15:30;"Throw that on."
15:30;15:31;"Is it not a cover?"
15:31;15:33;"They should have-- no, it's not a cover."
15:33;15:35;"Somebody on Blue Skies said it was a cover."
15:38;15:42;"Oh, okay. This is-- yeah, this is very different."
15:42;15:44;"I like the idea of what you're saying, though."
15:44;15:47;"Just have him come out, do some--"
15:47;15:50;"Ooh, that's very Grammy-ish."
15:50;15:55;"Yeah, they should have brought out Duff McKagan"
15:55;15:58;"wearing a suit made out of Flame It Hot Cheetos."
15:58;16:00;"That would have been fun."
16:00;16:03;"Ooh."
16:03;16:05;"You know, they could have dropped inflatables"
16:05;16:08;"that look like big Flame It Hots onto the crowd"
16:08;16:10;"so they could pass them around."
16:10;16:14;"They should have had a cannon shooting Flame It Hot dust onto the crowd."
16:14;16:17;"Dude, they should have had a bag of Flame It Hot tape"
16:17;16:19;"underneath every seat in the auditorium."
16:19;16:21;"Oh, yeah."
16:21;16:25;"Yeah, run out into the crowd and kind of do one of those Oscar bets"
16:25;16:29;"where they're like, ""Okay, Margo, how many are you going to eat?"""
16:29;16:31;"Oh, my God, I like--"
16:31;16:33;"Becky G."
16:33;16:36;"Oh, we love Flame It Hot down in Australia."
16:36;16:38;"Okay, Margo ate four."
16:38;16:40;"How about you, Scorsese?"
16:40;16:42;"Okay, okay, I'll eat--"
16:42;16:45;"Now, we've also included a packet of wet wipes"
16:45;16:48;"to get the orange [bleep] off your hands"
16:48;16:53;"after you've crushed the bag of Flame It Hot Cheetos."
16:53;17:00;"Killian Murphy just stone-faced as Jack Black and Stephen Adler"
17:00;17:03;"surround him with Flame It Hot Cheeto bags."
17:03;17:05;"Stephen Adler?"
17:05;17:07;"Former drummer of Guns N' Roses."
17:07;17:09;"Yeah, okay, that's what I thought you were saying."
17:09;17:13;"I'm just playing off the fact that Barbie got slashed."
17:13;17:15;"Okay."
17:15;17:17;"They get the original drummer from Geno."
17:17;17:19;"Stephen Adler."
17:19;17:29;"♪"
17:29;17:31;"I'm liking this Bob Seger stuff, man."
17:31;17:33;"This is '90s."
17:33;17:51;"♪"
17:51;17:54;"Wouldn't it be cool if they used both fire and science for the movie?"
17:54;17:56;"Yeah."
17:56;17:58;"'Cause this is really driving and triumphant."
17:58;18:00;"It could have really--"
18:00;18:03;"So, kind of period-specific, right?"
18:03;18:05;"Like, when does the film take place?"
18:05;18:09;"True, '80s into '90s, I think."
18:09;18:12;"So maybe while he's, like, climbing up the ladder,"
18:12;18:14;"like, you get this, like, for a montage."
18:14;18:18;"Then you do the Diane Warren cover for the credits."
18:18;18:21;"Yeah, you know what also would have been cool?"
18:21;18:23;"I mean, obviously, it's very easy to be"
18:23;18:27;"a Monday morning marketing quarterback."
18:27;18:31;"And, you know, Becky G, she seems cool."
18:31;18:34;"She's a Mexican-American singer."
18:34;18:37;"So, you know, I'm reading about her now."
18:37;18:40;"All four of her grandparents are from Mexico."
18:40;18:43;"So she has, you know--"
18:43;18:47;"She has that connection in terms of heritage to Richard Montanez."
18:47;18:49;"And I could understand, they're like, well, she's cool"
18:49;18:53;"'cause she's kind of like a younger pop star type."
18:53;18:56;"It also could have been cool if they just went totally traditional."
18:56;19:01;"Just, like, a real traditional, like, Mexican ballad in Spanish."
19:01;19:02;"Oh, nice."
19:02;19:05;"Just about, like, you know, like, Los Tigres del Norte style."
19:05;19:08;"Just, like, the ballad of Montanez."
19:08;19:11;"Ooh, just like a real tearjerker."
19:11;19:13;"Yeah, with, like, the big horns."
19:13;19:15;"In Spanish subtitles. Yeah."
19:15;19:18;"And then imagine if they came out just, like,"
19:18;19:23;"trad Mexican ballad about the rise of Montanez."
19:23;19:27;"And just, like, but talking about flaming hot Cheetos and stuff."
19:27;19:28;"That would have been cool."
19:28;19:30;"The ballad of Montanez."
19:30;19:32;"Anything else worth talking about from the Oscars?"
19:32;19:34;"I wanted to shout out the actress--"
19:34;19:37;"What's her name? Sandra Hueller? Is that her name?"
19:37;19:38;"Oh, yeah."
19:38;19:44;"From Zone of Interest and Anatomy of a Fall."
19:44;19:49;"I did see that she is still a certified forklift operator."
19:49;19:52;"People on Twitter brought that to our attention."
19:52;19:53;"That's pretty-- that's amazing."
19:53;19:55;"It made me think, I mean, made me wonder, like,"
19:55;19:58;"geez, how long does that permit last in Germany?"
19:58;20:01;"I feel like in California, you had to renew it every, like, three years."
20:01;20:05;"So what does she actually say?"
20:05;20:08;"I didn't read the-- it was, like, a little headline I saw that was, like--"
20:08;20:11;"I think it was to the effect of, you know,"
20:11;20:13;"as successful as she might be right now."
20:13;20:17;"She's, you know, basically, she's not worried about work"
20:17;20:22;"because she can always fall back on her forklift--"
20:22;20:23;"Certification."
20:23;20:24;"Certification, yeah."
20:24;20:27;"Not taking anything for granted, not counting her chickens,"
20:27;20:32;"because she's a working girl and used to operate a forklift, I guess."
20:32;20:34;"I have a theory about this."
20:34;20:36;"She's doing a bit."
20:36;20:39;"This is a joke, and she's not really forklift certified,"
20:39;20:42;"but she's dialed in on the internet humor"
20:42;20:44;"and is making a funny reference."
20:44;20:45;"I could be wrong."
20:45;20:47;"You think she's maybe a TC head?"
20:47;20:52;"Well, I think the whole meme of, like, certified forklift operator--"
20:52;20:53;"Right."
20:53;20:56;"You think that's made it to her desk?"
20:56;20:57;"I don't know. I just don't--"
20:57;21:00;"Do you really think she's forklift certified?"
21:00;21:02;"I believe-- I don't--"
21:02;21:05;"Yes, I believe at one point she was forklift certified."
21:05;21:09;"Again, it makes me wonder how long the certification lasts in Germany."
21:09;21:12;"I don't think that she would say--"
21:12;21:14;"knowing nothing about this woman--"
21:14;21:17;"I don't think she would make a joke about being forklift certified"
21:17;21:19;"if she had never been forklift certified."
21:19;21:20;"And you know what? You're correct."
21:20;21:21;"Stealing valor."
21:21;21:22;"No, you're right."
21:22;21:24;"I thought she was doing a joke,"
21:24;21:27;"but it actually looks like she did it for a film."
21:27;21:34;"She got certified for a film called In the Aisle by Thomas Stuber,"
21:34;21:36;"a German film from 2018."
21:36;21:39;"Oh, and actually in the art, in the key art, the poster,"
21:39;21:41;"she's in the forklift."
21:41;21:46;"It's a forklift in the poster."
21:46;21:49;"I like this a little less."
21:49;21:53;"So she got certified for the film, or she got the role--"
21:53;21:56;"maybe she got the role because she's certified."
21:56;21:58;"It says she got certified for the role."
21:58;22:04;"Yeah, she flew back to--"
22:04;22:07;"it said, ""Hueler's last taste of Hollywood glamour"
22:07;22:10;"was in 2016 at the Golden Globes,"
22:10;22:12;"and the day after the ceremony, she flew back to Germany"
22:12;22:15;"to do her certification to become a forklift operator"
22:15;22:17;"for a role in Stuber's Isles."""
22:17;22:19;"So I still like that."
22:19;22:24;"I like it. I like it a little less, but I like it."
22:24;22:27;"I mean, in my experience, it only took about two hours to get certified,"
22:27;22:30;"so it's not exactly like a bonerous process."
22:30;22:31;"You know, it's funny."
22:31;22:35;"I was actually just talking about this, if I should get certified."
22:35;22:37;"For what?"
22:37;22:41;"Moving the Vampire Weekend road cases onto the semi."
22:41;22:44;"Let me think about it, because I don't want to give too much away."
22:44;22:47;"But, you know, just we've been working on our--"
22:47;22:49;"designing our live show, you know,"
22:49;22:52;"because when the proper tour starts in June,"
22:52;22:54;"I want this to be our greatest tour ever,"
22:54;22:57;"so it's got to have a look and a feel."
22:57;23:01;"And without going into details, there was some talk about--"
23:01;23:04;"this is not the theme of the show, but it's almost adjacent,"
23:04;23:09;"where I was like, ""Oh, could it be cool to have anything like a scissor lift on stage?"""
23:09;23:11;"So can you picture like a scissor lift?"
23:11;23:14;"Yes, I love where your head's at with that."
23:14;23:17;"So we were talking, ""Would a scissor lift be interesting?"""
23:17;23:21;"And we were talking about kind of that kind of X shape in a scissor lift."
23:21;23:24;"You know, that just got me thinking, right, because maybe that's--"
23:24;23:26;"because sometimes with the set stuff, it can get tricky,"
23:26;23:28;"because you have to fabricate stuff yourself."
23:28;23:31;"And there's these companies that specialize in this,"
23:31;23:34;"and they're doing huge arena shows, and it's kind of like--"
23:34;23:38;"you know, even for a small show, if you have a specific idea,"
23:38;23:42;"you might need somebody to kind of fabricate a certain shape"
23:42;23:44;"and put in the video wall behind it."
23:44;23:47;"And even if you want your video wall to be round and--"
23:47;23:49;"you know, somebody's got to build all that stuff."
23:49;23:52;"So I was thinking about things that wouldn't require much time."
23:52;23:55;"So I was like, ""Well, a scissor lift, you could just get that anywhere."""
23:55;23:58;"Drive it right on stage, or-- I was looking at those like--"
23:58;24:01;"I was thinking about funny little vehicles like that, things that you could drive."
24:01;24:05;"Wait, so would you rent a scissor lift in each city,"
24:05;24:08;"or would you travel with a scissor--"
24:08;24:10;"Travel with a scissor lift."
24:10;24:12;"I would need my guys to price it out."
24:12;24:14;"But I was just thinking, if there could be--"
24:14;24:16;"Yeah, I don't know. I imagine--"
24:16;24:18;"I like that for my guys."
24:18;24:20;"Yeah, I like that for my guys."
24:20;24:22;"[laughs]"
25:20;25:27;"But somehow that conversation led to being like,"
25:27;25:29;"""Could a forklift play a role at all?"""
25:29;25:31;"And I was saying, ""Well, you know, this kind of--"
25:31;25:34;"the forklift meme, being forklift certified,"
25:34;25:37;"it's been around for years now. It's probably on its last legs."
25:37;25:42;"If there was ever a tour where as somehow part of the tour,"
25:42;25:45;"I or a member of the band should get forklift certified,"
25:45;25:47;"this would be it, you know?"
25:47;25:49;"I can't wait any longer."""
25:49;25:51;"This is very weird. It's--"
25:51;25:54;"It's very Guns N' Roses,"
25:54;25:56;"Use Your Illusion era."
25:56;25:59;"Axl would wear like a full catcher's outfit."
25:59;26:00;"Yeah."
26:00;26:05;"And like, I could just see like a weird stage stunt"
26:05;26:07;"that era of Guns N' Roses with Axl,"
26:07;26:11;"like driving a forklift like off the stage or something."
26:11;26:15;"Do you think the, you know, forklift,"
26:15;26:19;"you know, operator community would be--"
26:19;26:24;"I think it's a little bit of sort of stealing valor."
26:24;26:27;"I think if I got certified, they can't say sh*t."
26:27;26:31;"Maybe at some point, you know, the band's just sh*t cooking,"
26:31;26:34;"got a nasty groove happening,"
26:34;26:35;"and I go, ""Oh, hold on a second."""
26:35;26:38;"I come out in a hard hat, drive the forklift on stage,"
26:38;26:40;"and I pick up a pallet."
26:40;26:42;"You know, showmanship stuff."
26:42;26:45;"I don't know, and maybe I document my journey,"
26:45;26:49;"but like, you know, I'm sorry, but if I'm certified,"
26:49;26:52;"I don't care how many years you spend in the warehouse."
26:52;26:56;"Like, technically, we are both allowed to operate a forklift."
26:56;26:58;"I like some, like, longshoremen at the show just being like,"
26:58;27:02;"""You know what, man? My culture, that's not your--"
27:02;27:04;"you know, that's not for you to take and just--"""
27:04;27:06;"""That's not your costume."""
27:06;27:09;"""My culture is not your costume,"" Ezra Koenig."
27:09;27:11;"I want to say, though, real quick,"
27:11;27:14;"I like this idea of this person thinking that"
27:14;27:17;"while all the members of the band,"
27:17;27:20;"they're all just like bumper cars,"
27:20;27:22;"on stage driving forklifts."
27:22;27:25;"Forklifts just crashing into each other."
27:25;27:27;"That sounds real dangerous, guys."
27:27;27:29;"Brian Cross is going to have a heart attack."
27:29;27:31;"The whole show could be--"
27:31;27:33;"Yeah, well, also, I guess if you take it to its extreme,"
27:33;27:35;"actually, the band-- maybe the band can't play."
27:35;27:37;"We're going to do all tracks,"
27:37;27:40;"so there's no gear on stage other than boxes and pallets"
27:40;27:42;"that we can, like, move."
27:42;27:44;"Big hit with the fans."
27:44;27:47;"Yep. I guess-- and also, I think as a way to pay tribute"
27:47;27:50;"to people who actually work in warehouses,"
27:50;27:53;"longshoremen, things of that nature,"
27:53;27:56;"I would try to make sure that they understood"
27:56;27:58;"that I was doing it."
27:58;28:00;"I wasn't trying to literally steal their valor."
28:00;28:03;"Like, if I came out, and I'm wearing kind of like a--"
28:03;28:06;"you know, a car heart and a hard hat,"
28:06;28:08;"maybe that's too much."
28:08;28:10;"Maybe what I need to do is take a page"
28:10;28:13;"from our fellow Apple Music host,"
28:13;28:15;"Elton John's book,"
28:15;28:18;"and you remember when he played Dodger Stadium"
28:18;28:20;"in the '70s,"
28:20;28:24;"he famously came out in this, like, very--"
28:24;28:28;"like, probably 10,000-sequin Dodgers outfit"
28:28;28:30;"that was so sparkly,"
28:30;28:32;"and he came out with, like, a baseball bat."
28:32;28:35;"He was wearing this, like, insane, sparkly Dodgers outfit"
28:35;28:37;"and kind of, like, did, like, a fake crack of the bat"
28:37;28:40;"and then sat down and was, like, ripping on piano."
28:40;28:42;"So maybe I'll do, like, a kind of--"
28:42;28:45;"a warehouse forklift operator outfit,"
28:45;28:49;"but just covered in sequins, bedazzled to the hilt,"
28:49;28:51;"just shining, kind of like Liberace"
28:51;28:54;"meets a warehouse employee."
28:54;28:56;"And then they'll see that I'm kind of like--"
28:56;28:58;"I'm paying tribute to them,"
28:58;29:00;"but I'm not trying to pretend I am them."
29:00;29:03;"I'm recognizing that I come from show business,"
29:03;29:05;"and I'm meeting them halfway."
29:05;29:07;"- You are an effete coastal elite."
29:07;29:08;"- That's right."
29:08;29:10;"- The moment you have to encounter"
29:10;29:12;"the real forklift operator,"
29:12;29:14;"and you're wearing the sequined outfit."
29:14;29:16;"- Yeah. [laughs]"
29:16;29:18;"- So good."
29:18;29:20;"- But I just do it, like, so campy,"
29:20;29:22;"just like, ""Should I do it?"""
29:22;29:25;"And maybe even, like, then on the video screen,"
29:25;29:28;"like, we play, like, a montage"
29:28;29:31;"of me getting forklifts certified in the city of commerce,"
29:31;29:33;"and then I actually come out,"
29:33;29:35;"and just, like, the crowd goes nuts."
29:35;29:37;"I mean, look, all I'm saying is there's a--"
29:37;29:41;"there's a ticking clock when it comes to"
29:41;29:44;"bringing the house down with a forklift--"
29:44;29:48;"a certified forklift operator bit in a rock concert."
29:48;29:52;"I don't think it's gonna play in four years from now."
29:52;29:54;"I think this is the sweet spot."
29:54;29:56;"- You gotta seize the moment."
29:56;29:58;"- This is the time to do it."
29:58;29:59;"- No argument here."
29:59;30:01;"- What if Baio is standing on a pallet,"
30:01;30:03;"and then--and he's just, like,"
30:03;30:05;"he's, like, rippin' a bass solo."
30:05;30:08;"[imitates bass solo]"
30:08;30:10;"And he comes over, and it's like,"
30:10;30:12;"""Oh, here comes the forklift."""
30:12;30:14;"I put the prongs into the pallet."
30:14;30:17;"I lift him up, and he's looking around like, ""What?"""
30:17;30:18;"[imitates bass solo]"
30:18;30:20;"And he's just going higher and higher and higher."
30:20;30:22;"And then I bring him back down."
30:22;30:25;"I mean, that right there is a showstopper."
30:25;30:27;"- This could be, like, your--you know how, like,"
30:27;30:30;"Pink likes to do the aerial flying stuff with, like, the rope?"
30:30;30:34;"This could be, like, the thing that you do for decades."
30:34;30:36;"This could be your, like, your visual--"
30:36;30:38;"- I've always wanted more stuff like this."
30:38;30:40;"- I just want to flag, though,"
30:40;30:43;"you cannot have any alcohol before the show."
30:43;30:46;"You can't have any drinks and then operate heavy machinery, okay?"
30:46;30:48;"- Oh, boy. All right."
30:48;30:50;"- No tequila shot before you go on stage"
30:50;30:52;"if you're gonna be operating a forklift,"
30:52;30:54;"especially if you're, you know,"
30:54;30:56;"ferrying your band members around."
30:56;30:58;"- If I just do, like, a full Motley Crue bit,"
30:58;31:00;"where... [laughs]"
31:00;31:02;"It's just, like, I kind of come out with, like--"
31:02;31:04;"- A bottle of Jack. - A bottle of Jack,"
31:04;31:06;"and I'm just, like, chugging it, and I'm like,"
31:06;31:08;"""Should I operate this forklift?"""
31:08;31:10;"The crowd's like, ""Hell yeah!"""
31:10;31:12;"[laughter]"
31:12;31:15;"And I'm just like, ""They don't want me to."""
31:15;31:17;"Like, we have, like, one of the Crue guys come out"
31:17;31:20;"dressed as a cop, and I'm just like, ""Whatever, man."""
31:20;31:23;"And then later I get arrested, and I'm just like,"
31:23;31:25;"""No, no, no."" I guess, like, I have to write, like,"
31:25;31:28;"a letter to, you know, the city of Milwaukee"
31:28;31:30;"that was pure performance."
31:30;31:33;"There was apple juice in that bottle of Jack Daniels."
31:33;31:36;"I really apologize to Milwaukee PD"
31:36;31:40;"for making their life difficult under no circumstances."
31:40;31:45;"Should anybody ever drink and operate heavy machinery,"
31:45;31:47;"I'm sorry to have even joked about it."
31:47;31:49;"- You can also go the opposite moment,"
31:49;31:52;"sort of NWA kind of style,"
31:52;31:54;"where you have actors as cops"
31:54;31:56;"always come out to arrest you..."
31:56;31:58;"- Right. Yeah. - Nice."
31:58;32:00;"- ...and then you're just waiting, wasted."
32:00;32:02;"- Oh, yeah, but then we have, like, a Keystone Cops moment"
32:02;32:04;"where I kind of, like, I shimmy out of, like, the cuffs,"
32:04;32:06;"and I get it back in the forklift,"
32:06;32:08;"and they're chasing me all around the stage."
32:08;32:10;"And you know what? This is where you get"
32:10;32:12;"into true showmanship, is that I'm like,"
32:12;32:14;"""Vrrr, can't go right."
32:14;32:16;"""Brr-brr-brr, back up. Vrrr, can't go back."""
32:16;32:18;"And then I turn to the audience,"
32:18;32:20;"and then they don't realize that this thing"
32:20;32:22;"is rigged on invisible wires,"
32:22;32:24;"and I forklift over the audience."
32:24;32:26;"[laughter]"
32:26;32:28;"- Meanwhile, the band's just vamping"
32:28;32:30;"on, like, the cruddiest funk groove."
32:30;32:32;"- [laughs]"
32:32;32:34;"- 12-minute bit."
32:34;32:36;"- [laughs]"
32:36;32:38;"Just doing a..."
32:38;32:40;"[laughs]"
32:40;32:42;"[imitates music]"
32:42;32:44;"- Sounds like a hell of a show."
32:44;32:46;"- There's something here."
32:46;32:48;"- Then you go, ""Thank you."
32:48;32:50;"""The next song is called 'Hannah Hunt.'"""
32:50;32:52;"[laughter]"
32:52;32:54;"[Hannah Hunt's ""Hannah Hunt"" plays]"
32:54;32:56;"- ♪ I'm in a diamond Hannah ♪"
32:56;32:58;"♪ There's no fiction ♪"
32:58;33:00;"♪ There's no answer ♪"
33:00;33:02;"♪ Don't remember when you left, darling ♪"
33:02;33:04;"♪ You and me, we got our hopes in the dime ♪"
33:16;33:18;"- What's a forklift weigh? I'm gonna guess, like,"
33:18;33:20;"1,500 pounds."
33:20;33:22;"- Didn't Drake have, in one of his shows"
33:22;33:25;"in the last five years, he had a car fly, right?"
33:25;33:27;"- Did he? Oh, no, I was the one where he stood"
33:27;33:30;"on this weird kind of, like, a platform"
33:30;33:32;"that would then sort of go above the crowd"
33:32;33:34;"while he would sing to them individually."
33:34;33:36;"That was some tour that I went to."
33:36;33:38;"I don't remember him getting a car fly."
33:38;33:40;"- Oh, yeah. He had a flying-- - He had a car fly."
33:40;33:42;"- Yeah, it was a Ferrari. - Flying Lamborghini?"
33:42;33:44;"- Ferrari. - Ferrari, uh, five years ago."
33:44;33:46;"Looks like on one of his tours."
33:46;33:48;"Wow, it looks pretty crazy. I've never seen this."
33:48;33:50;"It's just, like, levitating. - So the Ferrari would fly over the crowd."
33:50;33:53;"So probably-- - A forklift weighs 9,000 pounds."
33:53;33:55;"- What?! [laughter]"
33:55;33:57;"- Wait, that was just a Ferrari weigh."
33:57;33:59;"- Okay, but that's the thing."
33:59;34:01;"We'll have to talk to Drake's team"
34:01;34:04;"because I'm sure it was not a full Ferrari."
34:04;34:06;"It was probably some sort of fabricated fiber."
34:06;34:08;"- A Ferrari's around 4,000 pounds."
34:08;34:10;"- Yeah, there's no way they were flying"
34:10;34:13;"4,000 pounds over the audience."
34:13;34:15;"No one's gonna insure that."
34:15;34:17;"So it must have been a lightweight thing."
34:17;34:19;"You got any info, Seinfeld?"
34:19;34:21;"- Well, no, I was just gonna suggest you could do, like,"
34:21;34:23;"the Ikea version of a forklift, you know?"
34:23;34:25;"Like, if you go to Ikea, you pick up television."
34:25;34:27;"- Of the small ones? - It's like--"
34:27;34:29;"Just, like, it's like a plastic, like, facsimile."
34:29;34:31;"I guess it would still have to work, though."
34:31;34:34;"- We're gonna have a special effects team."
34:34;34:36;"We're gonna have Industrial Light and Magic"
34:36;34:38;"put this together, and I'm gonna say,"
34:38;34:40;"""Guys, here's the thing."
34:40;34:43;"""I need a forklift that can move a little bit."
34:43;34:46;"""It has lights, and the fork can move,"
34:46;34:49;"""but it's gotta be--it's gotta weigh--"
34:49;34:51;"it tops 400 pounds."" - I think it's achievable."
34:51;34:53;"- It's a custom forklift."
34:53;34:56;"It has to be able to lift, like, at least 200 pounds."
34:56;34:58;"Pallet plus, like, a dude."
34:58;35:00;"- Yeah, maybe it doesn't-- - Wait a second."
35:00;35:03;"- Maybe we just gotta use sleight of hand for the--"
35:03;35:05;"- If you're gonna get certified, though,"
35:05;35:07;"you've gotta be--"
35:07;35:09;"Like, would the rules apply"
35:09;35:11;"if it's a new kind of forklift?"
35:11;35:13;"Do you know what I'm saying?"
35:13;35:15;"Like, would you need to get certified"
35:15;35:17;"if it's not a real forklift? No,"
35:17;35:19;"but I would still do it for love of the game."
35:19;35:22;"- Fair. - Also, does certification"
35:22;35:24;"work across state lines? I mean, I'm picturing Ezra"
35:24;35:26;"rolling into the show in Phoenix,"
35:26;35:28;"and part of the pre-show ritual"
35:28;35:32;"is that there is a certified forklift instructor..."
35:32;35:34;"- [laughs] - Waiting for him at the venue."
35:34;35:36;"- This is too good. - They do a quick--"
35:36;35:38;"- I mean, this is-- - They do a quick, like,"
35:38;35:40;"40-minute primer."
35:40;35:42;"Ezra does a written test and demonstrates"
35:42;35:44;"his facility with the machine."
35:44;35:47;"He's done in an hour."
35:47;35:50;"But that is, for insurance purposes,"
35:50;35:52;"a crucial part of your pre-game ritual."
35:52;35:55;"The bus generally pulls into town"
35:55;35:57;"around 5 a.m."
35:57;35:59;"I'll sleep a few more hours."
35:59;36:02;"Up and at 'em at 8, grab a cup of coffee"
36:02;36:04;"while the crew is starting to put up the lights."
36:04;36:06;"I do a little bit of exercise,"
36:06;36:10;"and then I go get forklift certified"
36:10;36:12;"in whatever city I'm in."
36:12;36:15;"Back at the venue for a sound check,"
36:15;36:19;"and that's how we stay one step ahead of the law."
36:19;36:21;"There's gotta be a Guinness--"
36:21;36:23;"like, a Guinness World Record you could get"
36:23;36:25;"for, like, most certifications,"
36:25;36:27;"or, like, the only guy to be certified"
36:27;36:30;"- across America. - That's for the fucking 50 states."
36:30;36:33;"I mean, the forklift certified tour is pretty good."
36:33;36:35;"- [laughs] - It's pretty--"
36:35;36:38;"I mean, this is the last year to do it, man."
36:38;36:40;"It's had a hell of a run as a meme,"
36:40;36:43;"as a concept, but it's not gonna last forever."
36:43;36:45;"That is so, like, hair metal band."
36:45;36:48;"The forklift certification tour."
36:48;36:51;"[laughs]"
36:51;36:53;"- All right, guys. - Should we call our guys?"
36:53;36:55;"- Yeah, we gotta call the boys. - Oh, yeah."
36:55;36:57;"- We gotta call our guys. - You wanna set 'em up?"
36:57;36:59;"These guys are the talk of the town."
36:59;37:01;"- They really are. - Zachary Schweitz"
37:01;37:03;"and Christian Hansen, they made"
37:03;37:06;"the octopus murders for Netflix."
37:06;37:08;"It's a big hit."
37:08;37:11;"It's been top ten on Netflix for a couple weeks."
37:11;37:14;"It's a show about conspiracy theories"
37:14;37:17;"involving the death of journalist Danny Casolaro"
37:17;37:19;"in 1991."
37:19;37:21;"He was a journalist who was uncovering"
37:21;37:23;"what he called the octopus,"
37:23;37:26;"a series of interrelated covert actions"
37:26;37:29;"involving the U.S. government, the CIA,"
37:29;37:32;"and all sorts of bad stuff."
37:32;37:34;"These guys kind of picked up the case"
37:34;37:37;"and said, ""What happened to this guy, Danny Casolaro?"""
37:37;37:40;"A lot of people believe he was killed for what he knew."
37:40;37:42;"So these guys revisit his death,"
37:42;37:44;"and they kind of get back into the same stuff"
37:44;37:47;"that Danny Casolaro was researching himself."
37:47;37:49;"A lot of twists and turns."
37:49;37:51;"It's a great documentary,"
37:51;37:53;"and clearly it's resonating with people."
37:53;37:58;"And we know someone in common with Zachary,"
37:58;38:01;"so we actually got an email a couple weeks ago,"
38:01;38:03;"""Would you wanna have these guys on?"""
38:03;38:06;"And we'd actually heard that they had listened to"
38:06;38:09;"our interview with Tom O'Neill about his book ""Chaos."""
38:09;38:11;"So I said, ""All right."""
38:11;38:12;"Absolutely."
38:12;38:16;"And it feels like perfectly TC, so let's get 'em on."
38:16;38:20;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
38:20;38:23;"[beeping]"
38:23;38:25;"All right, fellas, welcome to the show."
38:25;38:26;"Very happy to have you."
38:26;38:28;"Thanks so much. It's great to be here."
38:28;38:31;"Congratulations on the success of your documentary."
38:31;38:33;"It's clearly resonating with people,"
38:33;38:35;"and we've all watched, and we think it's great."
38:35;38:36;"Amazing."
38:36;38:38;"I guess for anybody,"
38:38;38:42;"any listeners who live under a rock"
38:42;38:45;"and they don't know about your doc series"
38:45;38:46;"or what it's about,"
38:46;38:49;"can you just give the quick summary of how it started"
38:49;38:51;"and the impetus behind making it?"
38:51;38:54;"It actually started for me with a--"
38:54;38:56;"I was writing a paper in college"
38:56;38:58;"about the private prison industry,"
38:58;39:04;"and that led me to this company called Wackenhut,"
39:04;39:08;"which was the second-largest private prison company in America"
39:08;39:11;"and was involved in a lot of other things"
39:11;39:13;"other than private prisons."
39:13;39:16;"It was a giant multinational security company."
39:16;39:19;"The board of directors were department heads"
39:19;39:25;"from the FBI, the NSA, generals in the Air Force, CIA."
39:25;39:30;"The outside counsel was Reagan's CIA director."
39:30;39:34;"Turns out they were-- I was digging into it,"
39:34;39:37;"and it turned out that they formed this joint venture"
39:37;39:39;"with the Native American Reservation"
39:39;39:42;"in the Coachella Valley outside of India, California."
39:42;39:45;"And this journalist named Danny Castellaro"
39:45;39:50;"had been looking into this particular event"
39:50;39:53;"and what was going on on this reservation"
39:53;39:55;"with this security company."
39:55;40:01;"And this reporter died a year into his research,"
40:01;40:06;"and it shocked me that I'd never heard of him before,"
40:06;40:09;"and he seemed like such a cool guy."
40:09;40:12;"And the book, from what I could gather,"
40:12;40:17;"that he was writing seemed just fascinating and bizarre."
40:17;40:20;"And I just started looking into it,"
40:20;40:22;"and, like, it's-- you know,"
40:22;40:24;"it ended up being like a 12-year odyssey."
40:24;40:26;"- So it starts when you're in college."
40:26;40:28;"You're looking into it in your free time."
40:28;40:33;"As you show in the doc, you were working as a--"
40:33;40:36;"your day job is being a photographer."
40:36;40:39;"- It's a little confusing because I had dropped out of college,"
40:39;40:42;"and I was working in New York as a photographer"
40:42;40:45;"for The New York Times as a freelance photographer."
40:45;40:49;"Then I went back to college to finish my degree,"
40:49;40:51;"finally, after several years."
40:51;40:53;"- Okay. - Yeah."
40:53;40:58;"That's--it's a little--my--my sort of own chronology"
40:58;40:59;"is a little bit confusing."
40:59;41:01;"- Well, and you guys are old friends?"
41:01;41:04;"- Yeah, we grew up--we grew up together."
41:04;41:06;"- Wait, so you're both from Kentucky?"
41:06;41:07;"- Yeah, we're from Louisville."
41:07;41:10;"- Okay, so you both--and you both know"
41:10;41:12;"a friend of the show, Morgan Leibis?"
41:12;41:14;"- That's Zach's cousin. - Right, so--okay."
41:14;41:17;"So Morgan is your cousin. - Yeah."
41:17;41:20;"- So anyone who's trying to create a time crisis octopus,"
41:20;41:24;"you're gonna be drawing lines between me and Jake and Morgan,"
41:24;41:27;"Morgan to Zach, Zach to you."
41:27;41:28;"Okay."
41:28;41:30;"- There's more. There's more to it."
41:30;41:37;"There's--we edited our show in the Chilin Island offices,"
41:37;41:39;"and I love time crisis."
41:39;41:42;"It's the best--well, it's an Internet radio show."
41:42;41:45;"It's the best of the bunch."
41:45;41:48;"And there was one day where I was listening to time crisis,"
41:48;41:51;"looking at some spreadsheet, and for all the dangerous,"
41:51;41:56;"exciting stuff that I have to do in the course of my research"
41:56;42:00;"and this project, there's, like, five times more, you know,"
42:00;42:02;"boring, tedious things, and the best thing to do"
42:02;42:05;"is to hang out with you guys, you know?"
42:05;42:08;"- Oh, hell yeah. - Your bi-weekly radio show."
42:08;42:12;"And I'm sitting there listening to time crisis,"
42:12;42:14;"and Deathspot walks in the office,"
42:14;42:17;"'cause he was, you know, obviously the producer"
42:17;42:19;"of Chilin Island. - Right."
42:19;42:22;"- I didn't say anything. It was just too--it was too bizarre."
42:22;42:25;"- ♪ This little piggy got a house made of bricks ♪"
42:25;42:28;"♪ Hand over hand over hand over this ♪"

42:50;42:52;"through our producer Rachel, too."
42:52;42:54;"- Yeah, which is very strange. - Right?"
42:54;42:57;"- So where a friend of the show, Morgan Levis,"
42:57;43:00;"is, you know, related to these guys,"
43:00;43:04;"it turns out that my niece is the segment producer"
43:04;43:07;"of Octopus Murders."
43:07;43:09;"- Your niece? - Amantha's niece, yeah."
43:09;43:13;"- Okay, so we really have a mini octopus on our hands here."
43:13;43:15;"- Absolutely. - I know, absolutely."
43:15;43:18;"- And then while me and Zach were driving around the country"
43:18;43:20;"knocking on people's doors and trying to, like,"
43:20;43:23;"come up with the mystery of the octopus,"
43:23;43:26;"we would go on the--you know, be driving for hours and hours"
43:26;43:29;"and we'd listen to the show."
43:29;43:31;"And it was while listening to the show that we learned"
43:31;43:35;"about Tom O'Neill, who became our friend eventually"
43:35;43:39;"and mentor and hero. - Author of ""Chaos."""
43:39;43:42;"So you were literally--the two of you are driving around"
43:42;43:46;"the country being Tom O'Neills, and then you hear Tom O'Neill."
43:46;43:48;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And you're like--"
43:48;43:50;"- On your show. - Wow."
43:50;43:52;"So you instantly must have been like,"
43:52;43:54;"""This man is our spiritual brother."""
43:54;43:57;"- Exactly, yeah. - I mean, wow."
43:57;43:59;"Like, there's so many questions we could ask"
43:59;44:02;"about the show itself, but as I think about it,"
44:02;44:05;"I really just encourage anybody who hasn't seen it,"
44:05;44:09;"go watch it, because we could be in here talking about"
44:09;44:14;"Amazon, Wackenhut, and Michael--"
44:14;44:16;"- Oh, my gosh. - We could talk about--"
44:16;44:19;"- Philip Arthur Thompson. - Yeah."
44:19;44:21;"But the truth is, you should just go watch it."
44:21;44:23;"I think--I just want our audience,"
44:23;44:25;"anybody who hasn't seen it, to understand"
44:25;44:29;"that you were basically two childhood friends."
44:29;44:31;"Zach, you have a background in film."
44:31;44:33;"You've directed movies. You worked on movies,"
44:33;44:36;"doing other stuff. Christian, you were getting deeper into this."
44:36;44:39;"Zach is kind of talking about it with you,"
44:39;44:41;"decides to make a documentary. I just want people--"
44:41;44:44;"they should go watch it to understand the depth of it."
44:44;44:48;"But I think for us, what I'm kind of interested in"
44:48;44:52;"is what life looked like as you two guys,"
44:52;44:56;"starting in your 20s, became obsessed"
44:56;44:59;"with a 1991 death of this journalist"
44:59;45:01;"and start kind of just going out there"
45:01;45:03;"and doing original research."
45:03;45:05;"Like, I guess my first question is,"
45:05;45:07;"before this became a Netflix show,"
45:07;45:09;"you were just so obsessed with this"
45:09;45:11;"that you were just kind of out-of-pocket"
45:11;45:13;"researching this yourself?"
45:13;45:17;"Right, yeah. I was writing a book about it."
45:17;45:19;"And so I--you know, after college,"
45:19;45:21;"I ended up back in New York City,"
45:21;45:24;"and I was freelancing again for The New York Times."
45:24;45:27;"And in order to cover my expenses,"
45:27;45:31;"I only needed to shoot about three assignments a week."
45:31;45:33;"And so then I had the rest of the days"
45:33;45:36;"to work on the case."
45:36;45:39;"And sometimes the assignments would only last an hour."
45:39;45:41;"You know, like a perp would get released"
45:41;45:43;"from whatever, walk into the courthouse,"
45:43;45:46;"and I just have to be there, get the picture, file it,"
45:46;45:48;"and I can get back to work."
45:48;45:50;"My work started getting really bad."
45:50;45:52;"I mean, thankfully, the editors, you know,"
45:52;45:55;"supported me and trusted me or something,"
45:55;45:57;"but, like, yeah, some people focus exclusively"
45:57;46:00;"on being a photographer at a high level."
46:00;46:03;"They're not doing it just to, like, fund"
46:03;46:05;"their crazy research project."
46:05;46:07;"But that was how I was able to, like,"
46:07;46:08;"maintain for a long time."
46:08;46:11;"And then also, you know, there would be ebbs and flows,"
46:11;46:13;"but then these FOIAs,"
46:13;46:15;"these Freedom of Information Act requests,"
46:15;46:18;"would come, you know, in one year later,"
46:18;46:21;"three years later, seven years later,"
46:21;46:23;"and that would kind of, like, reinvigorate"
46:23;46:26;"the investigation with thousands of more pages"
46:26;46:28;"and new names and new leads."
46:28;46:30;"And I think probably a lot of us"
46:30;46:33;"have always been interested in,"
46:33;46:36;"for lack of a better word, conspiracy theories,"
46:36;46:39;"interested in these alternative histories"
46:39;46:41;"or just interested in finding out more of the truth."
46:41;46:43;"Okay, what really happened?"
46:43;46:45;"You know, did the CIA really have something to do"
46:45;46:47;"with bringing drugs into this country?"
46:47;46:49;"Many of us are interested in it."
46:49;46:52;"Many of us will read up on Wikipedia."
46:52;46:54;"You know, I've had my days."
46:54;46:56;"My days, I was very interested in reading,"
46:56;46:59;"understanding more about the Contras in the '80s"
46:59;47:02;"when I was probably, like, 25."
47:02;47:04;"Next thing you know, I'm reading about Gary Webb,"
47:04;47:08;"another journalist who died by suicide"
47:08;47:10;"and a lot of conspiracy theories."
47:10;47:12;"But for me, that's where it ends."
47:12;47:14;"I'm a Wikipedia guy."
47:14;47:17;"I might talk to Jake and Nick and Seinfeld"
47:17;47:20;"and be like, you know, I was, like, telling Jake,"
47:20;47:22;"I was like, ""You know that there's a conspiracy theory"
47:22;47:26;"that the U.S. did not drop nuclear weapons on Hiroshima?"""
47:26;47:28;"[laughs]"
47:28;47:29;"And then you start reading about it,"
47:29;47:31;"and there's some interesting plausible connections,"
47:31;47:32;"and we talk about it."
47:32;47:35;"Well, why would that be the case, and what did they gain?"
47:35;47:37;"Whatever, but that's where we leave it."
47:37;47:39;"So I'm curious, where did you get the--"
47:39;47:40;"Where does that notion come from?"
47:40;47:42;"Like, why is someone saying that?"
47:42;47:43;"Oh, yeah, well, even that."
47:43;47:45;"Yeah, why do people believe that?"
47:45;47:49;"But again, we might talk about it over a beer."
47:49;47:51;"There might be a little bit of light Googling."
47:51;47:54;"But that's where it ends."
47:54;47:55;"Very light Googling."
47:55;48:01;"So my question for you is, where does this compulsion"
48:01;48:02;"and the fire inside come from?"
48:02;48:04;"One thing, actually, Wikipedia--"
48:04;48:07;"I mean, obviously, I went there first, too,"
48:07;48:10;"and there's a Wikipedia page about Danny Castellaro,"
48:10;48:13;"and it said that he was a dabbler in journalism,"
48:13;48:16;"like, basically a hack, a kook."
48:16;48:17;"And I was sort of just like--"
48:17;48:20;"I didn't know, but I was looking at kind of like,"
48:20;48:23;"what if he got killed and didn't kill himself?"
48:23;48:26;"And the story he was working on seems pretty complex."
48:26;48:28;"Like, how could he be a kook?"
48:28;48:31;"And then it also says he ran a trade publication"
48:31;48:33;"for, like, 15 years, and that's--"
48:33;48:36;"it's not glamorous journalism, but it is journalism."
48:36;48:39;"So I was kind of mad about the mischaracterization"
48:39;48:41;"of him on Wikipedia."
48:41;48:44;"But more specifically to the point,"
48:44;48:47;"I read everything that had been published"
48:47;48:50;"about this series of crimes"
48:50;48:54;"and the mysterious death of Danny Castellaro,"
48:54;48:56;"and then, you know, I got to a point"
48:56;48:57;"where I wasn't satisfied."
48:57;49:00;"And it was a big moment where I decided"
49:00;49:06;"to call the people who are quoted in these articles,"
49:06;49:08;"these people who are firsthand--"
49:08;49:10;"you know, the first person I talked to"
49:10;49:13;"was Bill Hamilton, who invented this software."
49:13;49:17;"And, you know, it really felt like a big leap"
49:17;49:19;"from, you know, dabbling in the case"
49:19;49:21;"to, like, now I'm, like-- now I'm in it."
49:21;49:23;"- Have you always been a go-getter?"
49:23;49:25;"- Yeah, definitely. I think so."
49:25;49:26;"- Right, so for you, you're just like--"
49:26;49:28;"you get interested in something--"
49:28;49:30;"- I was photographing for the Times"
49:30;49:32;"when I was 22 years old, you know?"
49:32;49:33;"I was just like-- I just moved to New York"
49:33;49:35;"and just went for it, yeah."
49:35;49:36;"- Okay, right, so you're no stranger"
49:36;49:38;"to just being like, ""I'm interested in this."
49:38;49:41;"Let's go. I'm not gonna, like, think too much about it."""
49:41;49:43;"- And when you called Bill Hamilton,"
49:43;49:46;"were you like, ""Hey, I'm a journalist."
49:46;49:48;"My name's Christian. I'm looking into the story."""
49:48;49:50;"Were you like, ""I was just reading on Wikipedia"
49:50;49:52;"about Danny, and I was just--"
49:52;49:54;"Like, how did you-- how'd you get--"
49:54;49:55;"like, yeah, like, that first call,"
49:55;49:56;"that first phone call?"""
49:56;49:59;"- That first call was a long time ago,"
49:59;50:01;"but he had continued research."
50:01;50:04;"The last article I'd read that he'd been quoted in"
50:04;50:05;"was probably in the '90s."
50:05;50:07;"- Wow. - But he was still on it."
50:07;50:10;"You know, he's still networking with reporters"
50:10;50:14;"and spies, he said, and, you know, sources,"
50:14;50:19;"and he had, like, really pushed the sort of theory"
50:19;50:21;"of what happened to his software specifically"
50:21;50:24;"and what happened to Danny, like, really far,"
50:24;50:28;"and so he just started sending me these, like, affidavits"
50:28;50:29;"and all this documentation"
50:29;50:32;"that he'd accrued over the years."
50:32;50:34;"I mean, we just--like, our conversation"
50:34;50:36;"went kind of like zero to 100."
50:36;50:38;"I haven't told this story."
50:38;50:40;"The first meeting that we had was in--"
50:40;50:44;"at a hotel in Bethesda, Maryland."
50:44;50:47;"We met, you know, in person for the first time,"
50:47;50:49;"and, like, well, I know the date."
50:49;50:52;"It was November 1, 2013."
50:52;50:54;"I know the date because, you know,"
50:54;50:56;"basically, I live--"
50:56;50:59;"I was living, I think, in Kentucky at the time,"
50:59;51:01;"and I have friends in D.C.,"
51:01;51:03;"and I knew if I came into D.C.,"
51:03;51:06;"I would have to go out with my friends"
51:06;51:07;"and sort of entertain,"
51:07;51:10;"and I kind of wanted to, like, settle down and focus,"
51:10;51:15;"and I figured that the hotels in D.C. would be expensive."
51:15;51:18;"Martinsburg, where Danny died, is an hour and a half away."
51:18;51:20;"The meeting was a lunch meeting,"
51:20;51:24;"so I decided to stay in the room where he died"
51:24;51:25;"in order to, like--"
51:25;51:26;"- Oh, on Halloween night?"
51:26;51:29;"- On Halloween night, in order to write that scene."
51:29;51:31;"- Room 517 at the Sheridan?"
51:31;51:33;"- Yes, exactly."
51:33;51:35;"It just happened to be--good job, Ezra."
51:35;51:37;"It just happened to be Halloween night,"
51:37;51:39;"and, you know, so I'm like,"
51:39;51:42;"just to familiarize myself with the space,"
51:42;51:45;"and, you know, 'cause at some point in the book I was writing,"
51:45;51:47;"I would need to get to that part,"
51:47;51:48;"and I don't know."
51:48;51:53;"I took some, like, papers that had actually belonged to Danny"
51:53;51:57;"and some books about him and some other materials,"
51:57;51:59;"and I put them on the bed."
51:59;52:01;"Then I got in the bath,"
52:01;52:03;"and this--"
52:03;52:04;"- Bro."
52:04;52:07;"- This, like, breeze from nowhere"
52:07;52:09;"started blowing inside the bathroom,"
52:09;52:13;"and it felt like a--it weirdly felt like a hug,"
52:13;52:17;"and then I was smoking cigarettes at the time,"
52:17;52:20;"and I went out to smoke a cigarette"
52:20;52:22;"after I, you know, dried off from the bath,"
52:22;52:26;"and the bolt lock of the door was locked,"
52:26;52:31;"and I never lock a bolt lock on a hotel room"
52:31;52:32;"because I don't know why--"
52:32;52:34;"you know, I don't know why anyone would--"
52:34;52:35;"you know, you got the key card."
52:35;52:37;"I'm just not locking the bolt locks."
52:37;52:39;"Maybe I did. I don't remember."
52:39;52:41;"I thought it was really weird."
52:41;52:45;"Then the next day I was out."
52:45;52:47;"I was wandering around the outside"
52:47;52:50;"photographing the exterior of the back side of the hotel,"
52:50;52:52;"like, where his room faced out,"
52:52;52:57;"and these hotel maids called over to me,"
52:57;52:58;"and I went over and talked to them."
52:58;53:00;"They were smoking cigarettes out the back door,"
53:00;53:04;"and they were like, ""Are you going to put these photos on Facebook?"""
53:04;53:07;"And I said, ""Well, I'm a journalist."
53:07;53:08;"I'm just, you know, I'm looking at--"
53:08;53:13;"I'm researching where this Danny Casolaro died,"
53:13;53:15;"and I'm looking into his story,"""
53:15;53:18;"and they were like, ""Oh, oh, yeah."
53:18;53:19;"We know all about that."
53:19;53:21;"What happened to him?"""
53:21;53:23;"And then they were like, ""You got to talk to Miracle."""
53:23;53:25;"And I was like, ""Who's Miracle?"""
53:25;53:28;"They said that she was one of the maids"
53:28;53:31;"working there at that point in 2013,"
53:31;53:37;"and that she is kind of tapped into spiritual stuff,"
53:37;53:41;"and she won't go in the room because things move around"
53:41;53:46;"and fall off the shelf and weird stuff like that."
53:46;53:48;"Anyways, I've never told that story before,"
53:48;53:50;"but then I went and drove to meet Bill Hamilton."
53:50;53:53;"We had this three-hour-long--"
53:53;53:54;"Whoa."
53:54;53:56;"That's a whole other documentary."

01:06:29;01:06:32;"He's, you know, he's a fascinating guy."
01:06:32;01:06:37;"And you talk about in the movie how he got busted for making acid, but..."
01:06:37;01:06:39;"Yeah, that's interesting that he was..."
01:06:39;01:06:44;"Yeah, PCP in an underwater lab in the Duwamish River in Seattle."
01:06:44;01:06:48;"Yeah. Insane. But I mean, it is very chaos too,"
01:06:48;01:06:52;"the connection between law enforcement,"
01:06:52;01:06:56;"counterculture, drugs, etc."
01:06:56;01:07:00;"Well, it's weird too, the tie-in. If he was in the hate in that era,"
01:07:00;01:07:04;"I mean, he might have just like walked right past Charlie Manson."
01:07:04;01:07:07;"Right, yeah. And he said he used to go to the free medical clinic."
01:07:07;01:07:10;"We tried to keep him away from the book chaos,"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"so we didn't want to like, you know..."
01:07:12;01:07:13;"Yeah, he would go nuts."
01:07:13;01:07:16;"Yeah, we wanted to learn as much about his connections to that story"
01:07:16;01:07:21;"before like it got possibly tainted by him reading the book."
01:07:21;01:07:25;"I imagine there must be people in the conspiracy theory world"
01:07:25;01:07:29;"who thinks Michael Raconisciuto was MK Ultrod."
01:07:29;01:07:33;"Yeah, we're getting into an area that I can't really go much further into, actually."
01:07:33;01:07:36;"It's kind of like a Ted Kaczynski vibe a little bit."
01:07:36;01:07:38;"When you're talking about chaos,"
01:07:38;01:07:42;"I feel like Michael is kind of the bridge from one San Francisco to another."
01:07:42;01:07:47;"He's like the bridge between the acid 60s and the methamphetamine,"
01:07:47;01:07:50;"like late 70s and 80s, right?"
01:07:50;01:07:52;"So it's like, it's a different drug,"
01:07:52;01:07:56;"but maybe some of the same actors involved out there."
01:07:56;01:07:59;"Wow. Yeah, which is a pretty important bridge."
01:07:59;01:08:02;"And the fact that he also gets tied up into all these other things,"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"it is pretty wild."
01:08:04;01:08:09;"I mean, not to say that he's the guy, but he's a prism."
01:08:09;01:08:13;"His life is almost a prism through which you can see that transition."
01:08:13;01:08:17;"Well, like meth kind of ruined the scene in The Hague."
01:08:17;01:08:21;"And it's speed and meth, and his partner,"
01:08:21;01:08:24;"we show in episode three, is murdered."
01:08:24;01:08:28;"And one of the motives for killing him was stealing all of the precursors"
01:08:28;01:08:33;"to the methamphetamine that he had stashed in an abandoned mine in Nevada."
01:08:33;01:08:37;"Crazy. There's so many insane details in this movie."
01:08:37;01:08:42;"We should tell that story though, because that really cursed Lillie."
01:08:42;01:08:46;"We don't even hit some of the high points of that."
01:08:46;01:08:52;"That bust, or that methamphetamine was eventually created after Paul died."
01:08:52;01:08:57;"It was synthesized, and that became the biggest meth bust in US history."
01:08:57;01:09:00;"Like, what, eight years later or something, Christian?"
01:09:00;01:09:06;"It was huge, but the thing that nobody's mentioned in the papers when they busted,"
01:09:06;01:09:10;"it was like, what, 9,000 pounds or something insane?"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"Millions and millions of dollars worth of meth."
01:09:12;01:09:17;"But what the authorities didn't mention is that most of it had already been sold."
01:09:17;01:09:19;"They just got a tiny fraction of it."
01:09:19;01:09:24;"And that's kind of like, in our research, or in Christian's research,"
01:09:24;01:09:31;"I guess it's this idea of drugs, drug busts not happening, being delayed,"
01:09:31;01:09:35;"and the federal authorities kind of either looking the other way"
01:09:35;01:09:42;"or being more involved than just a normal law enforcement capacity."
01:09:42;01:09:46;"Who can kill a general in his bed?"
01:09:46;01:09:50;"Overthrow dictators if they're red?"
01:09:50;01:09:53;"Amen."
01:09:53;01:09:59;"CIA man."
01:09:59;01:10:03;"Who can buy a government's own sheep?"
01:10:03;01:10:07;"Change a cabinet without a squeak?"
01:10:07;01:10:11;"Amen."
01:10:11;01:10:16;"CIA man."
01:10:16;01:10:20;"Who can train guerrillas by the dozens?"
01:10:20;01:10:24;"Send a man to kill their untrained cousins?"
01:10:24;01:10:27;"Amen."
01:10:27;01:10:29;"CIA man."
01:10:29;01:10:34;"One interesting thing I felt I really loved in the final episode of the show,"
01:10:34;01:10:37;"you have that quote from a fellow researcher."
01:10:37;01:10:42;"You have that really beautiful montage of different quotes from people"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"where you kind of take a bird's eye view again,"
01:10:44;01:10:47;"and you talk about not just the specifics of the case,"
01:10:47;01:10:52;"but you talk about the people like you, Christian,"
01:10:52;01:10:57;"people who do get obsessed with the case and dedicate their life to it,"
01:10:57;01:11:01;"and as well as somebody makes it, says, ""You know what? I made a decision."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"I was going to pull myself out."""
01:11:03;01:11:06;"Because it suddenly--I had this vision watching that section."
01:11:06;01:11:12;"Oh, this is like--just like there's the octopus of the bad actors"
01:11:12;01:11:15;"who perhaps are part of a vast conspiracy,"
01:11:15;01:11:20;"there's also the kind of like kind vibe octopus of just interrelated,"
01:11:20;01:11:25;"independent researchers who just got such deep love of the game."
01:11:25;01:11:29;"So you get a glimpse in that final episode into some of these other people."
01:11:29;01:11:35;"So I'm kind of curious about like--you clearly must have gotten a big taste of that world."
01:11:35;01:11:37;"So not the Michael Rikkonen shooters of the world,"
01:11:37;01:11:41;"but the fellow just kind of like pretty chill researcher."
01:11:41;01:11:48;"There was that woman that was really interesting that she was shown this like Dr. Zapruder film."
01:11:48;01:11:49;"What was that story?"
01:11:49;01:11:53;"Yeah, she jumped on the case like in '92,"
01:11:53;01:11:59;"like right after Danny Vanden started talking to the same kind of dangerous people"
01:11:59;01:12:03;"that Danny was talking to and like was going and having meetings with them."
01:12:03;01:12:06;"She actually told us that she doesn't experience fear."
01:12:06;01:12:09;"Well, did she go to Robert Nichols' apartment?"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"Yeah, she went to Robert Nichols' apartment."
01:12:11;01:12:14;"Because he was the scariest--I think he was the scariest guy in this whole thing."
01:12:14;01:12:17;"Totally. Who may or may not still be alive."
01:12:17;01:12:21;"That footage of him in 2008 in his deposition."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"Oh my God."
01:12:22;01:12:25;"That was so hard to get our hands on."
01:12:25;01:12:28;"We'd had the transcript of the deposition"
01:12:28;01:12:33;"and it said at the bottom like filmed in whatever downtown New York or whatever."
01:12:33;01:12:36;"And we're just like, ""We're making a film."""
01:12:36;01:12:40;"The deposition is interesting, but we can't really do that much with it."
01:12:40;01:12:43;"You know, show a little tight clip, you know."
01:12:43;01:12:47;"And so our best friend is an attorney in DC"
01:12:47;01:12:54;"and he helped us get a judge to release that footage."
01:12:54;01:12:57;"And it was like when the negotiations started,"
01:12:57;01:13:02;"it was sitting on this attorney's desk a few blocks from our office in Manhattan."
01:13:02;01:13:06;"But it took two years of negotiations."
01:13:06;01:13:15;"And then one day the phone rang and me and Zach biked 10 blocks to this plaza below this law office."
01:13:15;01:13:19;"And the lawyer came down and gave us these six DVDs."
01:13:19;01:13:25;"And it was like right when we got to the point in the story where we needed to cut in the Robert Booth Nichols story."
01:13:25;01:13:26;"It was amazing."
01:13:26;01:13:29;"You know, we was the best bike ride of our lives."
01:13:29;01:13:34;"And then you don't know in the text of all the glaring looks that he gives"
01:13:34;01:13:37;"and all the sneers and all the eye rolls and stuff."
01:13:37;01:13:40;"He just exuded malice."
01:13:40;01:13:43;"I mean, he just, he scared the crap out of me."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"So anyway, back to Ezra's question."
01:13:44;01:13:46;"So there was this, what was her name?"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"Oh, Sherry Seymour."
01:13:48;01:13:49;"Yeah."
01:13:49;01:13:51;"So she went to his house."
01:13:51;01:13:52;"Yeah."
01:13:52;01:13:59;"And then she was asking about, you know, what's the involvement of the justice department?"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"You know, what were you and Danny talking about?"
01:14:01;01:14:05;"You know, he and Danny would have these like long phone conversations."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"And then they met up in D.C."
01:14:07;01:14:14;"And basically at the end of the meeting, he plays this two tapes."
01:14:14;01:14:17;"One is, I mean, it's hard to describe."
01:14:17;01:14:24;"One, he says, is the doctored Zapruder film, which is the Zapruder film that we all know."
01:14:24;01:14:28;"And then he says the other one is the real Zapruder film,"
01:14:28;01:14:33;"which is where the driver shoots him and basically like seconds have been chopped out."
01:14:33;01:14:36;"But, you know."
01:14:36;01:14:39;"Yeah, and the doctored Zapruder film, it's like it slows down."
01:14:39;01:14:44;"And the driver of the limo that Kennedy is in just turns around and just blows his head off."
01:14:44;01:14:45;"Right."
01:14:45;01:14:56;"I mean, it's like and then what, you know, she never says that she believed, you know, the one that he said was the real one."
01:14:56;01:15:01;"She just said that she saw both these tapes."
01:15:01;01:15:10;"And a lot of people that have seen the show have sort of like misunderstood the subtle line that Zack is doing in his edit,"
01:15:10;01:15:17;"where basically the point that this guy is making is nothing as it appears to be."
01:15:17;01:15:20;"I don't think the driver shot Kennedy."
01:15:20;01:15:21;"No, I didn't."
01:15:21;01:15:22;"I don't think Lee shot Kennedy."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"I didn't interpret it that way."
01:15:24;01:15:30;"The implication was that he showed her a fake video to make her think that, well, either to discredit her."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"That's what she thinks."
01:15:31;01:15:35;"So that she would come out and say, because then if she starts writing an essay saying,"
01:15:35;01:15:42;"I saw the Reels of Pruder film and actually he was killed by his driver, then people would say, wait, you're nuts."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"You lack credibility."
01:15:44;01:15:52;"And I guess that would be a classic kind of disinformation tactic is like you got to think three, four steps ahead."
01:15:52;01:15:57;"And sometimes showing, you know, there's like the famous story."
01:15:57;01:16:10;"I don't know if it's totally accurate that the U.S. was actively encouraging UFO sightings and even leaving fake documents to make UFO conspiracy theorists feel
validated"
01:16:10;01:16:20;"because they wanted there to be a robust movement of people being like there's space invaders in the sky because that took attention away from perhaps advanced
technology."
01:16:20;01:16:24;"They were testing, you know, over New Mexico and Arizona."
01:16:24;01:16:27;"I don't know if that's true, but like you hear a story like that."
01:16:27;01:16:37;"I think it's true that they were releasing phony documents that purported to be legit UFO documents."
01:16:37;01:16:44;"Like seemed like internal demos about the UFO situation, but they were BS."
01:16:44;01:16:46;"Right. So just to confuse people."
01:16:46;01:16:47;"Just to confuse people."
01:16:47;01:16:54;"Well, if you really want to hide something, you would need to make sure that it's lost in a sea of disinformation."
01:16:54;01:16:56;"It's not enough just to say, just to hide it."
01:16:56;01:17:01;"You'd also want competing narratives going off in all different directions."
01:17:01;01:17:12;"Totally. I feel like the masterful moment that Bob Nichols pulls off in that meeting, though, is not having one fake Zapruder film, but two fake Zapruder films."
01:17:12;01:17:17;"Because he's like, here's the real one that you've been seeing on the news."
01:17:17;01:17:21;"Let me play that for you so you can check it against your own knowledge."
01:17:21;01:17:29;"And then he plays a second one and half of a tree in the background is missing, you know."
01:17:29;01:17:33;"And so this is a pre-internet era."
01:17:33;01:17:34;"This is like '92."
01:17:34;01:17:41;"So you've got to imagine like you're sitting in there in Robert Booth Nichols' apartment."
01:17:41;01:17:47;"And you can't just like Google it really quick and be like, what is the Zapruder film?"
01:17:47;01:17:54;"Which, by the way, as an aside, is absurdly hard to actually find a good quality version of the Zapruder film even now."
01:17:54;01:17:55;"Really?"
01:17:55;01:18:01;"Something for the TC community to kind of check on here because it's really ridiculous."
01:18:01;01:18:05;"But, you know, so you're just basing this on your memory."
01:18:05;01:18:10;"You're sitting in this apartment and you're like, wait, I guess, I mean, is there a tree missing?"
01:18:10;01:18:11;"I don't know."
01:18:11;01:18:16;"In '92, you're going to have to go and find a copy of it and whatever."
01:18:16;01:18:20;"And by the time you've done this, you sound crazy."
01:18:20;01:18:22;"You know, you sound like a conspiracy nut."
01:18:22;01:18:25;"So where are you guys at now?"
01:18:25;01:18:27;"Now that you've made this?"
01:18:27;01:18:29;"I thought we were going to rest for a bit."
01:18:29;01:18:30;"Yeah."
01:18:30;01:18:36;"But now that we're like spending all our time that we're not doing press, which we're grateful to do,"
01:18:36;01:18:44;"vetting like these people that are hitting us up from all corners with possible new leads."
01:18:44;01:18:45;"For the sequel."
01:18:45;01:18:47;"This also sounds like Tom O'Neill."
01:18:47;01:18:51;"So it takes a lot of time to vet the people."
01:18:51;01:18:56;"And they oftentimes write extremely, you know, sometimes I'll ask them to,"
01:18:56;01:19:00;"could you boil these many paragraphs down into like a paragraph where you're talking,"
01:19:00;01:19:03;"what is the point that you're making here?"
01:19:03;01:19:09;"And then it's just like, you know, more and more text."
01:19:09;01:19:15;"But, you know, just because people are, you know, eccentric or verbose doesn't mean that they don't have"
01:19:15;01:19:18;"possibly some sort of first hand information that we might need."
01:19:18;01:19:27;"Are you as fired up as ever in terms of like your enthusiasm and desire to uncover more of the story?"
01:19:27;01:19:31;"Yeah. I just want to have balance in doing it."
01:19:31;01:19:33;"You mean like a work life balance?"
01:19:33;01:19:37;"Yeah. Like, you know, have sort of a bit of a healthy life."
01:19:37;01:19:42;"You know, I think you could, you know, investigative reporters that work at a newspaper work really hard,"
01:19:42;01:19:46;"but they also have kids and a family and things like that."
01:19:46;01:19:49;"So if I could just keep it contained, that'd be ideal."
01:19:49;01:19:53;"But the calls come usually at late at night, you know."
01:19:53;01:19:55;"Oh my God."
01:19:55;01:19:57;"And on the weekends for whatever reason."
01:19:57;01:20:03;"Yeah. And I mean, I can only imagine at this point you must get all sorts of people trying to call you."
01:20:03;01:20:06;"Has anybody like told you to stop?"
01:20:06;01:20:10;"No. Not that I can think of off the top of my head."
01:20:10;01:20:12;"You think because the case is so old?"
01:20:12;01:20:19;"Because I mean, this presumably, you know, there's a very good chance that this guy, Danny Casolaro killed."
01:20:19;01:20:29;"Yeah. But the case is old and it's pretty well covered in confusion and doubt."
01:20:29;01:20:32;"It's a decent mess."
01:20:32;01:20:39;"And you know, the amazing thing about kind of conspiracies, I mean, even perhaps real conspiracies,"
01:20:39;01:20:47;"a conspiracy to do something illegal is that, you know, you don't have to keep it a secret forever."
01:20:47;01:20:50;"Just like, you know, 30, 40 years."
01:20:50;01:20:58;"Because then by the time you get a young guy who's kind of like the second coming of Danny Casolaro,"
01:20:58;01:21:05;"kind of looking around, you know, it's still a very interesting story and it's very compelling and it's gripping."
01:21:05;01:21:09;"But a lot of people are dead. A lot of time has passed."
01:21:09;01:21:12;"And, you know, let's say you do find a bombshell."
01:21:12;01:21:17;"Of course, many millions of us will be interested to find some resolution to this story."
01:21:17;01:21:25;"But, you know, then they'll send out, you know, a millennial kind of like CIA officer and say like,"
01:21:25;01:21:28;"thank you so much to these independent researchers."
01:21:28;01:21:34;"I'm all over this and we're going to make sure that our organization really cleans up their act."
01:21:34;01:21:39;"Because, you know, us, us millennial and zoomers, we're not going to play the way that those old guys did."
01:21:39;01:21:43;"Trust me. And yeah, let's make sure we do a lot of research on it."
01:21:43;01:21:47;"And then, you know, and maybe they will. Maybe they will. I'm not saying they won't."
01:21:47;01:21:52;"But again, a story like this doesn't need to be buried for a thousand years."
01:21:52;01:21:57;"You know, just enough to move on. Like, especially you look at like the promise software."
01:21:57;01:22:01;"That looks like a hundred years old in terms of how computers works."
01:22:01;01:22:05;"At the time it was cutting edge, but we're pretty far past that now."
01:22:05;01:22:11;"You asked about the threats and it's like we never got, you know, what in some ways."
01:22:11;01:22:15;"And I hate to say this, but we were kind of looking for. Right."
01:22:15;01:22:19;"It's like somebody approaches you in the dark alleyway while you're going home at night."
01:22:19;01:22:25;"And they're like, hey, by the way, shut the heck up. You know, whatever."
01:22:25;01:22:31;"And Christian used to talk about this. Like he was like at a certain point, you want somebody to reach out from the void."
01:22:31;01:22:35;"Right. And now I feel very strongly that I don't want that at all whatsoever."
01:22:35;01:22:38;"And so please, I did. Don't do that."
01:22:38;01:22:47;"There were two. There was one very obscure person whose name we got in a roundabout way from like a police officer."
01:22:47;01:22:53;"And he we called him and he knew a lot of the characters very intimately."
01:22:53;01:22:58;"And he made it very clear that what we were doing is very dangerous. We probably shouldn't do it."
01:22:58;01:23:08;"And if we do continue to do it, we need him to mail us these plutonium tip bullets and this special like adapter that you get on."
01:23:08;01:23:13;"I can't remember what millimeter gun. Yeah."
01:23:13;01:23:16;"Why would you need plutonium to bullets?"
01:23:16;01:23:22;"I don't know. He had a reason to really take these guys, these marauders that are after us down."
01:23:22;01:23:28;"But then there was another thing that happened, like, you know, about a whole comes through the door."
01:23:28;01:23:41;"About a month before we turned turned in the final product to Netflix, I was making my bed one morning and realized that one of the pillows on my bed was missing."
01:23:41;01:23:47;"I searched everywhere in my tiny studio apartment."
01:23:47;01:23:53;"It looked in the oven. I don't sleepwalk. I don't you know, it freaks me out to this day."
01:23:53;01:23:58;"I don't I mean, who knows what happened to it? But I don't know."
01:23:58;01:24:02;"I didn't see it on the sidewalk. I didn't throw it out the window. It disappeared."
01:24:02;01:24:05;"And it's like that's one of the weirder kind of things."
01:24:05;01:24:09;"Zach thinks the story is just not worth really telling."
01:24:09;01:24:12;"But it really I'm really concerned about what happened to the pill."
01:24:12;01:24:15;"Also, the pillowcase matched a set, whatever that I have."
01:24:15;01:24:21;"But it's like, so I'm not I'm obviously not trying to freak you out, but just because we're all we've already chaos."
01:24:21;01:24:24;"Wasn't that a that was there was a thing that the Manson family did."
01:24:24;01:24:29;"They'd go into people's houses and just move little things that they call that creepy crawling."
01:24:29;01:24:30;"Right. Yeah."
01:24:30;01:24:49;"Oh, Superman. Oh, John. Oh, mom and dad."
01:24:49;01:25:10;"Mom and dad. Oh, Superman."
01:25:10;01:25:22;"Oh, John. Oh, mom and dad."
01:25:22;01:25:30;"Mom and dad."
01:25:30;01:25:40;"Oh, John. Oh, mom and dad."
01:25:40;01:25:44;"Just a quick question. So what's going on? What's the latest with Michael?"
01:25:44;01:25:46;"Today, actually."
01:25:46;01:25:47;"Wow."
01:25:47;01:25:50;"He's good. He's been listening to a lot of the podcast."
01:25:50;01:25:53;"Scott notes."
01:25:53;01:25:55;"He's got his issues."
01:25:55;01:26:10;"He says he's being extorted and his ex wife's his late ex wife's son is in some sort of trouble in South California."
01:26:10;01:26:14;"He is in hiding somewhere else. I'm not sure where exactly."
01:26:14;01:26:16;"There's always some. Wow."
01:26:16;01:26:28;"Crazy stuff happening when I when I talk to him, but it is reassuring that we kind of like present his story as I mean, different."
01:26:28;01:26:31;"The story, the narrative we present is different than his narrative."
01:26:31;01:26:37;"And I felt like he would hate us. And it's very, very reassured that we still talk."
01:26:37;01:26:39;"Hmm. That's cool."
01:26:39;01:26:42;"So there might be a sequel or at least a continued."
01:26:42;01:26:47;"Yeah, we want to do we want to do more. We want to dig deeper."
01:26:47;01:26:51;"We did make it with the intention of this being the show."
01:26:51;01:26:58;"It's not like we left a cliffhanger in there to be like and just get ready for season two of the Octopus."
01:26:58;01:27:03;"That was not the intention. It was really meant to be a self-contained universe."
01:27:03;01:27:13;"The problem is that it simply is not a self-contained universe. And there's just so many things that we couldn't fit in there or that have come out since we've been
talking about this thing."
01:27:13;01:27:18;"I mean, you spend three years, four years or 12 years on this."
01:27:18;01:27:22;"And and there's just a million stories that connect that you want to tell."
01:27:22;01:27:26;"And it's just hard to fit it all into, like, you know, four parts for this."
01:27:26;01:27:32;"Not I'm sure a lot of people be interested to see what else you uncover."
01:27:32;01:27:38;"Just to turn it back as we get towards the end to a very more like particularly TC question."
01:27:38;01:27:49;"You know, one thing we loved about Chaos is just the image of Tom O'Neill just hitting random Denny's as he drives out to, you know, meet a retired cop out in the desert
somewhere."
01:27:49;01:27:56;"The impression you get from the film is that you guys are spending a lot of time just road tripping across the US."
01:27:56;01:28:00;"So just paint a picture of that for us. Like you guys foodies."
01:28:00;01:28:03;"Were you hit a Denny's when you're not with Michael Riccone?"
01:28:03;01:28:09;"No, we usually try to go to a place that's what, 4.7, 4.6, maybe 4.7."
01:28:09;01:28:16;"We try not to dip down below like a 4.4 or 4.3 on like a Google rating."
01:28:16;01:28:26;"And then our director of photography has like pretty specific rules about like it's a weighted average compared to like how many reviews are there, of course, you know."
01:28:26;01:28:32;"So, you know, a five star with only 10 reviews is worth potentially a lot less than a..."
01:28:32;01:28:34;"Oh, so you guys put a lot of thought into this."
01:28:34;01:28:43;"Yeah, a lot of time on the road and a lot of a lot of particular people and particular diets to deal with."
01:28:43;01:28:46;"Right. All right. So where's the best gentrified taco in America?"
01:28:46;01:28:50;"I really like Leo's in Los Angeles."
01:28:50;01:28:53;"Do you know the stand Leo's? This one on La Brea?"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"Oh, yeah."
01:28:55;01:28:59;"Yeah, that's good. So you're not hitting a lot of chain restaurants, but I mean, if you're just out like..."
01:28:59;01:29:00;"You like pull off the highway?"
01:29:00;01:29:04;"Temecula or you're out in the Cabazon area or, you know."
01:29:04;01:29:08;"Maybe do a Del Taco if we're out like San Bernardino County."
01:29:08;01:29:10;"Now you're speaking my language."
01:29:10;01:29:15;"You'll hit a Del Taco. You're not, it's not always about like a mom and pop kind of unique place."
01:29:15;01:29:21;"We would send the receipts in and our producer would make fun of us for eating so much Del Taco."
01:29:21;01:29:26;"And Wendy's. I got made fun of for going to Wendy's. You know, they were..."
01:29:26;01:29:32;"Oh, I like Wendy's if I'm hitting fast food. Wait, by the way, I think I hit the time crisis chain about this,"
01:29:32;01:29:36;"but I've never talked about it on the show and be perfect with you guys."
01:29:36;01:29:41;"Do you know what this new thing they have at Del Taco is? The Birria Ramen?"
01:29:41;01:29:46;"No, unfortunately we've been on the East Coast for way too long."
01:29:46;01:29:49;"I saw that that existed though."
01:29:49;01:29:52;"Yeah, you did hit the thread about that, but no one's..."
01:29:52;01:29:53;"You got to get back out here."
01:29:53;01:30:00;"I mean, to me, this is such a, like a kind of watershed event because, you know,"
01:30:00;01:30:06;"like Dunkin Donuts added avocado toast to their menu like four years ago, maybe more, five."
01:30:06;01:30:10;"You know, we were covering, we were doing independent research about that story."
01:30:10;01:30:15;"And, you know, that was like this moment where you're like, all right, avocado toast is really here."
01:30:15;01:30:23;"It shows that kind of a millennial, cute indie cafe sensibility has permeated culture to now"
01:30:23;01:30:26;"Dunkin Donuts is making avocado toast."
01:30:26;01:30:34;"Now, to me, you know, Del Taco has always been a pretty like funky place, you know, pretty no frills."
01:30:34;01:30:42;"And there's something about, so Birria Ramen, it's like, because Birria already is like, you know,"
01:30:42;01:30:47;"that's a very specific kind of Mexican preparation of meat."
01:30:47;01:30:54;"And then adding it to ramen, basically, this is something that, doesn't it sound like you would have heard about it on like a,"
01:30:54;01:31:01;"like there's this crazy food truck in LA by this like chef and they're making Birria Ramen and like,"
01:31:01;01:31:06;"all, you know, all the websites are freaking out about it and like hipsters are lining up."
01:31:06;01:31:08;"Like that's what Birria Ramen connotes to me."
01:31:08;01:31:20;"So to see it at Del Taco, it, to me, it just means that like foodie, food truck, chef culture has fully, fully permeated America."
01:31:20;01:31:25;"Right. Because at first glance, it almost seems like something that like maybe Taco Bell, you know,"
01:31:25;01:31:32;"like going kind of like weird and, you know, like accelerating a culture really quickly."
01:31:32;01:31:37;"Right. But this is so couture for them to do it as ramen."
01:31:37;01:31:40;"It's so like high, high minded."
01:31:40;01:31:45;"Right. Yeah, exactly. It's, it almost seems like they should just be doing like, check out our new Birria bowl."
01:31:45;01:31:50;"Even just adding Birria to the menu already is like, they're going Asian fusion."
01:31:50;01:31:53;"Right. Asian fusion at Del Taco."
01:31:53;01:31:56;"We're going to be out in Los Angeles in a couple of weeks."
01:31:56;01:32:01;"And if you guys want to do like a TC, like just taste testing at some point,"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"like we would be extremely down to get that."
01:32:03;01:32:05;"Oh, hell yeah. Let's link up."
01:32:05;01:32:06;"Let's do it."
01:32:06;01:32:08;"Do you have a documentary about it?"
01:32:08;01:32:12;"Ezra, there is a Birria. I'm looking at this Birria ramen."
01:32:12;01:32:19;"Basically the Los Angeles Reddit thread, like for food is a lot of Birria ramen."
01:32:19;01:32:22;"It's to add food trucks, everything you're saying, delicious truck."
01:32:22;01:32:24;"So they literally got this idea."
01:32:24;01:32:29;"I mean, that's what it seems like. They're like, oh, the here, the food truck for the Birria ramen food trucks moving."
01:32:29;01:32:33;"Yeah. There's a New York times cooking recipe for it and they get it home."
01:32:33;01:32:38;"So I guess this didn't cross our desk, but I guess it already had some import."
01:32:38;01:32:41;"Okay. So Birria ramen is kind of a thing."
01:32:41;01:32:43;"It's kind of a thing."
01:32:43;01:32:49;"So it's not, it's not quite as like nuts as being like Ropa Vieja Udon."
01:32:49;01:32:55;"Yeah, guys, it's a Dane. Let us know when you're out."
01:32:55;01:32:59;"We'll get that Birria ramen."
01:32:59;01:33:03;"Del Taco."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"Well, thanks so much for coming on guys."
01:33:05;01:33:13;"And congratulations. Like it's very obvious to watching the film, how much work and time you guys put into it."
01:33:13;01:33:17;"It's very well made and recommend everybody watches it."
01:33:17;01:33:25;"And honestly, it's really cool to see how, especially like, I gotta be honest for me."
01:33:25;01:33:35;"I've always been a little bit turned off by the wave of like kind of salacious true crime stuff that seems to be all over the podcast, all over the streaming services."
01:33:35;01:33:42;"Cause sometimes it really is just some like, just like, you know, like it's just sad."
01:33:42;01:33:54;"And then like people kind of get hyped on it. Like it's like a crazy horror movie and you're like, you know, but like it's, it's nice to see that maybe there, there is an
appetite for people who like are, you know,"
01:33:54;01:34:01;"are interested in a mystery, but also interested in learning more about history, learning more about how the world works."
01:34:01;01:34:10;"And even I think similar to chaos, what's inspiring is, is about, again, even if you take all the conspiracy stuff out of it, and this might seem like a weird framing,"
01:34:10;01:34:20;"but there's also just the vibe of like, Hey, if you're interested in something like you can find a meaning in educating yourself about it."
01:34:20;01:34:33;"And that's not just true for, for, you know, murders and conspiracies, even if you're just interested in Birria Ramen, just like, you know, I think that that's the big
takeaway for me is you can go one step beyond Wikipedia,"
01:34:33;01:34:40;"hit the library, submit a, an FOIA, a FOIA, FOIA for Birria Ramen."
01:34:40;01:34:49;"All right. The metaphor is breaking down a little bit, but I'm just saying, you know, I like, I like you, you provide, you guys provide a nice model for kind of a being a
go-getter,"
01:34:49;01:34:50;"I guess, as I said earlier."
01:34:50;01:34:58;"But don't harass people, be respectful always, you know, to people, you know, the people don't always want these things to happen to them."
01:34:58;01:35:08;"I mean, usually they don't, you know, with Sandy Hook, there was a lot of harassment happening and, you know, just like be like sensible and respectful always."
01:35:08;01:35:13;"Right. And probably most of most people are not cut out for these kinds of intense subjects."
01:35:13;01:35:20;"So just go research Birria Ramen, go do like a kind vibe interview with like the guy at Del Taco. When was this first on the menu?"
01:35:20;01:35:24;"How did they train you how to make it? Like how long have you been working here?"
01:35:24;01:35:28;"Like when they tell you they're bringing Birria Ramen, like what's your first thought?"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"I'm talking to myself."
01:35:30;01:35:32;"What's the intelligence connection?"
01:35:32;01:35:35;"Yeah. Don't go there."
01:35:35;01:35:38;"But is there? Could there be? I don't know."
01:35:38;01:35:43;"All right. Thank you so much, Zachary and Christian."
01:35:43;01:35:49;"Octopus Murders on Netflix. And we'll see you guys at Del Taco very soon."
01:35:49;01:35:50;"Thank you, guys."
01:35:50;01:35:52;"Now it's time for the top five."
01:35:52;01:35:59;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:35:59;01:36:06;"This week, we're just going to count down the top five songs of 1991, March 1991."
01:36:06;01:36:09;"The reason 1991?"
01:36:09;01:36:12;"That was the year that Danny Casolaro died."
01:36:12;01:36:18;"He died in August 10th, 91. So he just missed the grunge explosion."
01:36:18;01:36:21;"Oh, yeah. Literally grunge started fall 91."
01:36:21;01:36:22;"Like September."
01:36:22;01:36:23;"Well, yeah."
01:36:23;01:36:28;"Can I also point out that 91 is the year that Bob Seger's The Fire Inside was released."
01:36:28;01:36:29;"Oh, crazy."
01:36:29;01:36:37;"Maybe that's a slightly more-- This would definitely be the darkest top five, but let's say it's mostly because of Bob Seger's Fire Inside."
01:36:37;01:36:42;"But, you know, regardless of the mystery, rest in peace to Danny Casolaro."
01:36:42;01:36:47;"And you clearly seem like a very cool guy, very cool, intelligent man."
01:36:47;01:36:55;"The number five song this week in 1991, Sting, with All This Time."
01:36:55;01:36:57;"You know, I've been listening to some solo Sting lately."
01:36:57;01:36:58;"Really?"
01:36:58;01:36:59;"I know this song. Yeah."
01:36:59;01:37:02;"What have you been hitting? Fields of Gold and stuff?"
01:37:02;01:37:05;"Fields of Gold, Englishman in New York."
01:37:05;01:37:11;"A friend of mine was just talking about how there's this insane drum break in the middle of Englishman in New York."
01:37:11;01:37:17;"So I started listening to that and it just kind of sent me on a Sting thing."
01:37:17;01:37:23;"And were you listening to Desert Rose, the more later period?"
01:37:23;01:37:27;"I threw on Desert Rose. I wasn't feeling it that hard."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"Wow. Okay."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"It's pretty good."
01:37:31;01:37:34;"Is Desert Rose late period Sting?"
01:37:34;01:37:36;"1999."
01:37:36;01:37:37;"Okay."
01:37:37;01:37:42;"It almost sounds like Paul Simon or something."
01:37:42;01:37:45;"Yeah, it's a great Paul Simon melody."
01:37:45;01:37:48;"So this was written about the death of Sting's father."
01:37:48;01:37:51;"It's about a boy named Billy who wants to bury his father at the sea."
01:37:55;01:37:57;"I got to say, I'm kind of feeling this."
01:37:57;01:38:00;"Yeah, this is good. I've never heard this song."
01:38:01;01:38:03;"I ask tonight"
01:38:03;01:38:07;"One young, one old"
01:38:07;01:38:10;"I've a brass for the dying to serve the final rite"
01:38:10;01:38:15;"Won't you love, won't you teach"
01:38:15;01:38:19;"Which way the cold wind blows"
01:38:19;01:38:25;"And fussing and flapping and priestly black like a murder of crows"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"Yeah, that's good."
01:38:27;01:38:29;"All this time"
01:38:29;01:38:30;"Good stuff."
01:38:30;01:38:33;"I want to check out this album, The Soul Cages."
01:38:33;01:38:40;"The number four song this week in '91, Gloria Estefan, Coming Out of the Dark."
01:38:40;01:38:42;"I don't know if I know this one either."
01:38:42;01:38:47;"This was the first single Estefan released after an incident on March 20th, 1990,"
01:38:47;01:38:51;"where an 18-wheeler hit her tour bus, breaking her back and nearly killing her."
01:38:51;01:38:52;"Jesus."
01:38:56;01:39:03;"Why be afraid if I'm not alone"
01:39:03;01:39:10;"Life is never easy, the rest is unknown"
01:39:10;01:39:17;"And up to now for me it's been hands against all"
01:39:17;01:39:23;"Each and every moment, searching"
01:39:23;01:39:28;"What to believe, but we're out of the dark"
01:39:28;01:39:32;"Finally see the light of love"
01:39:32;01:39:36;"Shedding a little light"
01:39:36;01:39:43;"Coming out of the dark"
01:39:43;01:39:47;"I don't love the tears"
01:39:47;01:39:53;"I'm surprised. It sticks. Wow. Wow. It's show me the way."
01:39:53;01:40:07;"Every night I say a prayer"
01:40:07;01:40:11;"In the hopes that there's a heaven"
01:40:11;01:40:16;"But every day I'm more confused"
01:40:16;01:40:20;"As the saints turn into sinners"
01:40:20;01:40:25;"All the heroes and legends I knew as a child"
01:40:25;01:40:27;"Video for this directed by Michael Bay."
01:40:27;01:40:33;"Whoa. I mean, with sticks, I think of Come Sail Away and Mr. Roboto."
01:40:33;01:40:34;"Yeah."
01:40:34;01:40:37;"I didn't realize they had a hit so late."
01:40:37;01:40:38;"Yeah."
01:40:38;01:40:41;"Show me the way"
01:40:46;01:40:51;"Take me tonight to the river"
01:40:51;01:40:55;"And wash my illusions away"
01:40:55;01:40:59;"Show me the way"
01:40:59;01:41:03;"So Dennis de Young was the lead singer of Sticks."
01:41:03;01:41:04;"Yeah."
01:41:04;01:41:06;"And he produced and wrote this song."
01:41:06;01:41:11;"And as I slowly drift to sleep"
01:41:11;01:41:15;"Hearing his voice, I'm like, he could have been like an American Freddie Mercury."
01:41:15;01:41:16;"Big voice."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"Yeah, totally."
01:41:17;01:41:20;"Maybe Sticks is the American Queen."
01:41:20;01:41:23;"They just didn't have quite the material."
01:41:23;01:41:25;"Yeah."
01:41:25;01:41:27;"I mean, they have some good songs."
01:41:27;01:41:29;"Come sail away, come sail away"
01:41:29;01:41:32;"But listen to his voice. This is like a big..."
01:41:32;01:41:34;"He really sounds like Freddie Mercury to me."
01:41:34;01:41:38;"Yeah, I've never thought about the Dennis de Young, Freddie Mercury pipeline, but you're totally right."
01:41:38;01:41:41;"Show me the way"
01:41:41;01:41:43;"I just wanna"
01:41:43;01:41:46;"Show me the way"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"Oh, this is so depressing, huh?"
01:41:48;01:41:50;"That early 90s aesthetic."
01:41:50;01:41:52;"This is serious Eileen's car."
01:41:52;01:41:53;"Yeah."
01:41:53;01:41:56;"Tonight, take my hand and take my hand"
01:41:56;01:41:57;"Well, just throw on some different sticks."
01:41:57;01:41:59;"Actually, throw on ""Come Sail Away."""
01:41:59;01:42:02;"I'm sailing away"
01:42:02;01:42:05;"I wanna just feel out this American Queen thesis."
01:42:06;01:42:08;"With it so far."
01:42:08;01:42:14;"I remember really liking this song when I would hear it on Classic Q1043 growing up."
01:42:14;01:42:20;"I'm sailing away"
01:42:20;01:42:24;"This is the end of the Freaks and Geeks."
01:42:24;01:42:25;"Yes."
01:42:25;01:42:26;"Oh, yeah."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"Classic."
01:42:27;01:42:29;"Very well used in Freaks and Geeks."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"Yeah."
01:42:30;01:42:31;"Sort of perfect."
01:42:31;01:42:33;"So, this poignant middle school dance."
01:42:33;01:42:36;"This is the American Bohemian Rhapsody."
01:42:36;01:42:37;"A little more earnest."
01:42:37;01:42:40;"That's a sad commentary on American culture."
01:42:40;01:42:43;"Free to face the life that's ahead of me"
01:42:43;01:42:47;"Let's face it, England really punched above its weight with the rock bands."
01:42:47;01:42:50;"I'm bored, I'm a catfish in the wind"
01:42:50;01:42:51;"Yeah, they had some good ones."
01:42:51;01:42:54;"So, climb aboard"
01:42:54;01:42:58;"We'll search for tomorrow"
01:42:58;01:43:01;"And every shot"
01:43:01;01:43:05;"You know, his voice in 1990 is a little bit, it's less kind of mannered."
01:43:05;01:43:07;"Oh, Lord, I'll try"
01:43:07;01:43:09;"I kind of like his later vocals a little bit more."
01:43:09;01:43:10;"This is a little pinched."
01:43:10;01:43:12;"Yeah, it's a little more nasal."
01:43:12;01:43:19;"Carry on"
01:43:27;01:43:34;"I look to the sea"
01:43:34;01:43:40;"I mean, Dennis Young, he really had a knack for some sort of like"
01:43:40;01:43:43;"sad, slightly depressing"
01:43:43;01:43:47;"Some catchy song style"
01:43:47;01:43:50;"This is like theater rock."
01:43:50;01:43:51;"Yeah."
01:43:51;01:43:53;"Theatrical melancholy."
01:43:53;01:43:55;"But this song is moving."
01:43:55;01:43:58;"And the dreams we have"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"I never connected with this song."
01:44:00;01:44:02;"Even when it gets big?"
01:44:02;01:44:05;"Oh, no, I just"
01:44:05;01:44:08;"I'm not a big queen guy either."
01:44:08;01:44:13;"But like the rock part of Bohemian Rhapsody is like so good."
01:44:13;01:44:15;"On the path to gold"
01:44:15;01:44:16;"But we'll try"
01:44:16;01:44:19;"I always like this line."
01:44:19;01:44:24;"Or I like in the beginning when he says, ""But we'll try, oh Lord, I'll try"""
01:44:24;01:44:29;"To carry on"
01:44:29;01:44:33;"This part sounds great."
01:44:33;01:44:35;"It sounds like the hood or something."
01:44:35;01:44:36;"Yeah."
01:44:36;01:44:44;"A gathering of angels"
01:44:44;01:44:46;"A pin above my head"
01:44:46;01:44:48;"Oh, yeah, this sounds pretty sick."
01:44:48;01:44:49;"Yeah."
01:44:49;01:44:53;"According to our notes, Dennis Young is a devout Roman Catholic."
01:44:53;01:44:57;"And that kind of inspired his writing of ""Show Me the Way."""
01:44:57;01:45:00;"But also here he's talking about a gathering of angels"
01:45:00;01:45:01;"Carried above my head."
01:45:01;01:45:03;"I gotta say the music"
01:45:03;01:45:06;"The music in ""Freezing Geeks"" is so epic."
01:45:06;01:45:07;"Yeah."
01:45:07;01:45:08;"I have a couple of memories."
01:45:08;01:45:11;"I watched that show once, like, whatever, 20 years ago."
01:45:11;01:45:13;"Yeah, what else is there in ""Freezing Geeks""?"
01:45:13;01:45:17;"I remember, well, it closes with ""Box of Rain."""
01:45:17;01:45:19;"Oh, right."
01:45:19;01:45:21;"When Lindsay gets on the boat, falling dead."
01:45:21;01:45:24;"And it's, they use ""Box of Rain,"" which is sick."
01:45:24;01:45:27;"There's another scene where it's just like, she and like,"
01:45:27;01:45:31;"I think the character's name is Nick, the guy, Jason Segel."
01:45:31;01:45:34;"Yeah, he's huge into ""Rush,"" so there's a lot of ""Rush."""
01:45:34;01:45:36;"He's in the ""Rush,"" but he's also into the ""Who."""
01:45:36;01:45:37;"And there's a whole subplot of like,"
01:45:37;01:45:40;"are they going to go see the ""Who"" in Michigan?"
01:45:40;01:45:43;"But there's like, they have some sort of like romantic fallout."
01:45:43;01:45:46;"And it's, they use the ""Who."""
01:45:46;01:45:48;"The song is over"
01:45:48;01:45:51;"It's all behind me"
01:45:51;01:45:53;"I'm looking at the, oh yeah, go on."
01:45:53;01:45:55;"No, no, it's just like, and it's just the shot of like, Jason Segel,"
01:45:55;01:45:59;"like in a car, like upset about this like, teenage romance."
01:45:59;01:46:02;"And it's just like this poignant Pete Townsend vocal."
01:46:02;01:46:04;"And I just, for some reason, like, it's just like,"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"it just seared into my memory."
01:46:06;01:46:08;"And I saw it once like 20 years ago."
01:46:08;01:46:09;"Wow."
01:46:09;01:46:10;"So I'm looking, I'm looking at all the music from there."
01:46:10;01:46:14;"Obviously the opening song was ""Bad Reputation,"" Joan Jett."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"That's the theme."
01:46:15;01:46:18;"Strong use, running with the devil, Van Halen."
01:46:18;01:46:21;"I'm all right, Kenny Loggins, a lot of sticks."
01:46:21;01:46:23;"They use some deep purple."
01:46:23;01:46:27;"Oh, there's a shot of Martin Starr and his buddies"
01:46:27;01:46:29;"walking in slow motion."
01:46:29;01:46:33;"And it's like, oh mama, I'm in love."
01:46:33;01:46:34;"Who is that by?"
01:46:34;01:46:38;"Is that like Emerson, Lincoln Palmer?"
01:46:38;01:46:39;"You know that song I'm talking about?"
01:46:39;01:46:41;"Yeah, I do."
01:46:41;01:46:43;"I'm trying to, let me see if I can find it here."
01:46:43;01:46:46;"Matt, throw on the song ""Renegade"" by Sticks."
01:46:46;01:46:48;"I think this might be what you're talking about."
01:46:48;01:46:54;"Oh mama, I'm in love for the love from the love."
01:46:54;01:46:59;"Oh mama, I'm in fear for my life from the long I've loved."
01:46:59;01:47:00;"Dennis DeYoung."
01:47:00;01:47:02;"It's like, is this Sticks?"
01:47:02;01:47:03;"Yeah, it's Sticks."
01:47:03;01:47:07;"And it's like a slow motion of like Martin Starr and his,"
01:47:07;01:47:13;"like Lindsay's younger brother, Sam."
01:47:13;01:47:15;"And they're going to like fight some kids or something."
01:47:15;01:47:22;"Oh mama, I can hear you a-crying, you're so scared and all alone."
01:47:22;01:47:25;"Yeah, I think they're standing up to the bullies in this one."
01:47:25;01:47:33;"Sad tears coming down from the gallows and I don't have them in all."
01:47:42;01:47:46;"All right, the Sticks, critical re-appraisal happening in the franchise."
01:47:56;01:48:00;"So actually, this is Tommy Shaw singing, not Dennis DeYoung."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"Was that Dennis earlier in the song?"
01:48:07;01:48:08;"Yeah."
01:48:08;01:48:09;"The training?"
01:48:09;01:48:11;"I don't know, it says Tommy Shaw lead vocal on it."
01:48:11;01:48:12;"Okay."
01:48:20;01:48:27;"Hangman is coming down from the gallows and I don't have them in all."
01:48:37;01:48:38;"Sick."
01:48:38;01:48:42;"So many, like so few shows I think have done such a good job, or movies."
01:48:42;01:48:46;"I mean a handful have done it, but not like freaks and geeks about"
01:48:46;01:48:50;"really showing your identity based on the music, your musical taste."
01:48:50;01:48:51;"Of your era."
01:48:51;01:48:52;"Yeah."
01:48:52;01:48:53;"Of your high school years."
01:48:53;01:48:55;"It's just so good."
01:48:55;01:48:56;"Yeah."
01:48:56;01:49:02;"How they like really was like every, whatever sort of niche crew you were part of,"
01:49:02;01:49:07;"like how you identify solely based on the music you listen to."
01:49:07;01:49:11;"Sort of because Matt was just texting me, I was going to bring it up."
01:49:11;01:49:13;"When James Franco goes punk."
01:49:13;01:49:14;"Oh yeah."
01:49:14;01:49:15;"Yeah."
01:49:15;01:49:17;"He rides a bug."
01:49:17;01:49:22;"And it's like sort of really painful because he's like, he's sort of cosplaying for this girl,"
01:49:22;01:49:25;"but he's sort of feels lost because he's not part of his crew."
01:49:25;01:49:26;"Yeah."
01:49:26;01:49:27;"His girls left him."
01:49:27;01:49:28;"So he's like, I'm going to go punk."
01:49:28;01:49:29;"Oh, it's so good."
01:49:29;01:49:32;"He's throwing away the sticks tape and he's getting that."
01:49:32;01:49:38;"I think in the show they use black flag, which maybe doesn't line up quite historically."
01:49:38;01:49:43;"Cause I feel like, I feel like the show was set in the 80s, early 80s."
01:49:43;01:49:47;"I felt like it was set in like 80 or something, but I could be wrong."
01:49:47;01:49:51;"Black flag came out or damage came out December 91."
01:49:51;01:49:52;"Oh, 81, 81, 80."
01:49:52;01:49:53;"Sorry."
01:49:54;01:49:55;"Yes."
01:49:55;01:49:56;"81 of course."
01:49:56;01:49:57;"Yeah."
01:49:57;01:49:58;"So maybe, maybe it's set in 82."
01:49:58;01:49:59;"Okay."
01:49:59;01:50:00;"Hold on."
01:50:00;01:50:01;"I want to find this out."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"Did they mess up that bad?"
01:50:02;01:50:03;"Make your own mute."
01:50:03;01:50:04;"I think."
01:50:04;01:50:05;"Yeah."
01:50:05;01:50:08;"Find out what you're, you know, as I look here, they did use two dead songs, which is"
01:50:08;01:50:09;"sick."
01:50:09;01:50:13;"I do remember when they use ripple, but also freaks and geeks is set during the 1980 to"
01:50:13;01:50:14;"81 school year."
01:50:14;01:50:15;"Okay."
01:50:15;01:50:18;"So they fudge the black flag."
01:50:18;01:50:19;"So close guys."
01:50:19;01:50:20;"I'm pretty sure."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"I'm black flag here."
01:50:22;01:50:24;"It's on this."
01:50:24;01:50:28;"It says they're using diesel boy, punk rock one-on-one and lime green."
01:50:28;01:50:29;"You know what?"
01:50:29;01:50:30;"I haven't seen the show in 20 years."
01:50:30;01:50:31;"No, you're right."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"Black flag rise above rise above."
01:50:33;01:50:34;"It is rise above."
01:50:34;01:50:36;"That's exactly right."
01:50:36;01:50:37;"That's exactly."
01:50:37;01:50:38;"So they, you know what?"
01:50:38;01:50:39;"I'm going to forgive."
01:50:39;01:50:41;"I'm just going to, I'm going to let that one slide."
01:50:41;01:50:42;"Black flags, 1980."
01:50:42;01:50:44;"No, but rise above."
01:50:44;01:50:46;"Like he said, it's the December of 81."
01:50:46;01:50:50;"As we just said, the rise above album came out in late 81."
01:50:50;01:50:54;"So can we get Judd Apatow on the line?"
01:50:54;01:50:58;"Judd what gives man don't want to split hairs here, but okay."
01:50:58;01:51:04;"The number two song this week in 91, Timmy T with one more try."
01:51:04;01:51:06;"Sounds cool."
01:51:06;01:51:09;"Yeah, this immediately sounds good."
01:51:09;01:51:26;"Timothy, Timmy T Torres."
01:51:26;01:51:27;"Do you know this?"
01:51:27;01:51:28;"No."
01:51:28;01:51:30;"Oh, it sounds familiar."
01:51:30;01:51:33;"Timmy T wrote and produced it."
01:51:33;01:51:34;"It was inspired."
01:51:34;01:51:39;"Uh, he was inspired to write it after breaking up with a girlfriend."
01:51:39;01:51:47;"It's from Fresno."
01:51:47;01:51:50;"It topped the billboard hot 100 for one week."
01:51:50;01:51:56;"It was the first single from an independent record label to top the billboard hot 100"
01:51:56;01:51:59;"since Lionel Richie's truly an 82."
01:51:59;01:52:01;"Dude, I love this song."
01:52:01;01:52:21;"I guess on the album after this, he covered an Eric Carmen song."
01:52:21;01:52:23;"Oh, all right."
01:52:23;01:52:24;"All right."
01:52:25;01:52:31;"Also, doesn't the song sound so like it's hard to explain why that bass is pretty like"
01:52:31;01:52:39;"like freestyle American, but the, and his voice obviously is very American, but this"
01:52:39;01:52:40;"sounds so English to me."
01:52:40;01:52:54;"Can you just picture like an English like new wave artist singing one more try."
01:52:54;01:53:00;"One more try."
01:53:00;01:53:04;"I didn't know how much I loved you."
01:53:04;01:53:06;"Like Howard Jones or something."
01:53:06;01:53:07;"Yeah."
01:53:07;01:53:10;"It'd be like more professionally produced."
01:53:10;01:53:14;"I like how like kind of lo-fi this is like, Oh, this is great."
01:53:14;01:53:15;"I'm going to make things weird."
01:53:15;01:53:18;"I'm just like picturing this dude in kind of like a funky studio in Fresno."
01:53:18;01:53:19;"Yeah."
01:53:19;01:53:26;"He's just listening to like Howard Jones, Phil Collins, Simply Red, Spandau Ballet."
01:53:26;01:53:31;"He just like programs a song by himself, gets on the mic and that's a number one hit."
01:53:31;01:53:37;"It almost reminds me of like, if like the Emerson bros had made music in like 1990 instead"
01:53:37;01:53:38;"of 1978."
01:53:38;01:53:39;"Wait, so Baby?"
01:53:39;01:53:40;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:53:40;01:53:41;"The dude, like the two brothers up in like Spokane, Washington."
01:53:41;01:53:48;"One more try."
01:53:48;01:54:02;"I didn't know how much I loved you."
01:54:02;01:54:03;"One more try."
01:54:03;01:54:04;"Let me put my arms around you."
01:54:04;01:54:05;"I kind of want to check out that record."
01:54:05;01:54:06;"Oh yeah, it's got a great cover."
01:54:06;01:54:07;"Really?"
01:54:07;01:54:08;"Yeah."
01:54:08;01:54:09;"I love you."
01:54:09;01:54:15;"Oh baby, can we give it one more try?"
01:54:15;01:54:17;"Is Timothy Torres still around?"
01:54:17;01:54:20;"Let's see here."
01:54:20;01:54:22;"Timmy T. Yeah."
01:54:22;01:54:23;"Yeah."
01:54:23;01:54:28;"Timmy T co-hosts the Morning Personality DJ Toby."
01:54:28;01:54:30;"Oh, sorry."
01:54:30;01:54:35;"Timmy T co-hosts with Morning Personality DJ Toby."
01:54:35;01:54:40;"There's a photo of him making like a radio appearance."
01:54:40;01:54:43;"One more try."
01:54:43;01:54:45;"Beautiful song."
01:54:45;01:54:57;"And the number one song this week in 1991, Mariah Carey with ""Someday."""
01:54:57;01:55:03;"Mariah Carey wrote ""Someday"" as a teenager with her songwriting partner, Ben Margulis,"
