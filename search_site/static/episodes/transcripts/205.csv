00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:02;00:10;"On today's episode, we'll be joined by author and screenwriter, Carson Mel."
00:10;00:17;"We'll dig deep on the Jay Giles Band and their potential connections to Bruce Springsteen."
00:17;00:26;"All that, plus new music from Jungkook, Taylor Swift, and old music from Mary Hopkin."
00:27;00:32;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:19;01:22;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:22;01:23;"What up?"
01:23;01:25;"What's up, Jake? What's up, Seinfeld?"
01:25;01:27;"You see what I'm holding up here?"
01:27;01:29;"Wow. A Snickers."
01:29;01:33;"This is one of, I think we've discussed this on the show before,"
01:33;01:37;"this is one of probably a half dozen Snickers I'll eat this year."
01:37;01:38;"[laughs]"
01:38;01:42;"This was a desperation move ten minutes before showtime."
01:42;01:47;"I'm working in my studio, I'm like, ""Uh-oh, we're taping in ten."
01:47;01:48;"I'm going to be hungry."""
01:48;01:52;"Made a quick run to the corner store, picked up a six-pack and a Snickers."
01:52;01:55;"Are you going to drink beer as you eat the Snickers?"
01:55;01:59;"Yeah, well, I'm working on some peanut M&Ms right now, so I'm doing the candy beer combo."
01:59;02:02;"Beer and candy has always been a weird combo."
02:02;02:04;"Dude, it's a weird combo."
02:04;02:11;"Honestly, being 46 on the doorstep of 47 and rocking beer candy is hitting kind of rough right now."
02:11;02:16;"I smell beer and candy. Yeah."
02:16;02:20;"Actually, can we throw on Sex and Candy? Have we ever talked about this, Jake?"
02:20;02:21;"I'm actually very curious."
02:21;02:23;"I don't think we have."
02:23;02:26;"Okay, take me back to '97."
02:26;02:30;"You're hearing Sex and Candy by Marcy Playground everywhere."
02:30;02:36;"What's the 20-year-old collegiate GBV fan Jake thinking about this song?"
02:36;02:38;"I never liked the song."
02:38;02:43;"Hanging around downtown by myself."
02:43;02:44;"Big Nirvana."
02:44;02:48;"I had so much time to sit and think about myself."
02:48;02:49;"This verse."
02:49;02:51;"And there she was."
02:51;02:58;"Oh, totally, but then the delivery is almost little Malcomus, dinosaur, disaffected."
02:58;02:59;"No."
02:59;03:01;"But Kurt had that gear."
03:01;03:03;"It sounds a little bit like Malcomus to me."
03:03;03:08;"I smell sex and candy."
03:08;03:13;"Who's that lounging in my chair?"
03:13;03:17;"I can honestly see this being a pavement song, but with a different groove."
03:17;03:24;"This guy's kind of leaning into this nasty, kind of sexy groove."
03:24;03:25;"Right."
03:25;03:30;"Yeah, mama, this surely is a dream."
03:30;03:33;"How about this for a cover band?"
03:33;03:37;"We cover songs in the style of pavement."
03:37;03:43;"So we take more mainstream alternative rock radio hits from the '90s"
03:43;03:44;"and just do them a little pavement."
03:44;03:47;"For instance, Marcy Playground, it's not a million miles away,"
03:47;03:49;"but we do it more of a pavement groove."
03:49;03:50;"Yeah."
03:50;03:51;"The guitars get a little noisier."
03:51;03:52;"Yeah, I like that."
03:52;03:57;"In platform double suede, yeah, there she was."
03:57;04:00;"Yeah, this could honestly--it'll have those kind of cool turnarounds."
04:00;04:03;"This could have been on Bright in the Corners."
04:03;04:09;"I smell sex and candy."
04:09;04:12;"Who's that lounging in my chair?"
04:12;04:16;"It is a great chorus, and it's admirably restrained."
04:16;04:22;"Yeah, my memory of this is that it was way more kind of like funk inflected,"
04:22;04:27;"and it's much more, like you said, kind of more of a comic or something."
04:27;04:31;"Yeah."
04:31;04:39;"But I didn't like it because it was like, oh, this is the major label radio version of better bands."
04:39;04:43;"I was a snobby 20-year-old."
04:43;04:46;"I smell sex and candy."
04:46;04:49;"And I guess for me, I think of pavement because it's just a touch of--"
04:49;04:52;"A shady lane everybody wants one."
04:52;04:53;"Yeah."
04:53;04:56;"No, it's not a million miles from something on Bright in the Corners."
04:56;04:57;"Wait, when did Bright in the Corners come out?"
04:57;05:00;"'97."
05:00;05:01;"Something was in the air."
05:01;05:03;"Which came out first?"
05:03;05:07;"Wait, Seinfeld, I need a number crunch desperately."
05:07;05:08;"What's up?"
05:08;05:11;"When did Sex and Candy by Marcy Playground come out,"
05:11;05:14;"and when did Bright in the Corners by Pavement come out?"
05:14;05:19;"Throw on the first song on Bright in the Stereo."
05:19;05:26;"It doesn't sound like Sex and Candy, but I'm just kind of curious to do a comparison."
05:26;05:30;"All right, you got Sex and Candy, September 15, '97."
05:30;05:33;"You got Bright in the Corners, February 11, '97."
05:33;05:34;"All right."
05:34;05:35;"OK."
05:43;05:46;"Yeah, you got that more aggressive, noisy side of pavement."
05:46;05:47;"Mm-hmm."
05:47;05:53;"I remember not being that psyched on this."
05:56;06:08;"I remember being kind of turned off by this sing-songy, kind of rappy, Beck vibe."
06:08;06:10;"Yeah."
06:10;06:12;"The chorus is sick on this, though."
06:41;06:44;"I wonder if Marcy Playground ever rocked out."
06:44;06:47;"I'm ashamed to say I only know one of their songs."
06:47;06:49;"I don't know anything about them."
06:52;06:59;"But I do hear the similarity in the delivery."
06:59;07:01;"Yeah."
07:01;07:03;"It's very '90s."
07:06;07:10;"To me, it almost reminds me of Nirvana, like Polly or something."
07:13;07:19;"Stanfield, are you a Marcy Playground fan?"
07:19;07:21;"Oh, I love all the deep cuts of Marcy."
07:21;07:23;"No, I only know the one song."
07:23;07:27;"But I did notice that the lead singer's name is John Wozniak."
07:27;07:30;"And I'm wondering if he's related to--"
07:30;07:31;"Oh, to Steve Woz?"
07:31;07:32;"To Woz?"
07:32;07:33;"To the Woz."
07:33;07:34;"Yeah, yeah."
07:34;07:36;"Let's get a number crunch on that."
07:36;07:37;"I'm on it."
07:40;07:52;"Now let's go back and hear track one on the Marcy Playground album,"
07:52;07:54;"assuming it's not Sex and Candy."
07:56;07:58;"OK, they do rock out."
07:58;07:59;"OK."
08:02;08:05;"[MUSIC - ""LONG LONG AGO IN CHINA""]"
08:05;08:22;"I can hear a solo Malcolmist song opening."
08:22;08:25;"(SINGING) Long, long ago in China, I'm told."
08:30;08:34;"I mean, these guys must have been pavement fans."
08:34;08:35;"(SINGING) Poppy."
08:38;08:40;"Maybe not."
08:40;08:41;"I don't know."
08:41;08:43;"Let's get a number crunch on that, too."
08:43;08:46;"Is Marcy Playground on record as being pavement fans?"
08:46;08:48;"Or are they like, you guys like pavement?"
08:48;08:50;"They'd be like, you know what, man, it really pisses me off"
08:50;08:52;"when people ask us about that."
08:52;08:53;"Don't know the band at all."
08:53;08:54;"Yeah, they're like, who?"
08:54;08:56;"Maybe we have some shared influences."
08:56;09:01;"(SINGING) I'm something far better, I'm told."
09:01;09:02;"Yeah."
09:05;09:09;"Poppy."
09:12;09:14;"Yeah."
09:16;09:17;"It's pretty tasteful."
09:17;09:18;"Yeah."
09:20;09:21;"Poppy."
09:24;09:25;"Poppies?"
09:25;09:26;"Yeah, it's like some weird-- like,"
09:26;09:28;"this is like a weird history song,"
09:28;09:29;"like about the opium wars."
09:29;09:30;"It must be."
09:30;09:32;"That's very pavement."
09:32;09:34;"That's totally like solo Malcolm S."
09:37;09:40;"You know, one weird thing about me"
09:40;09:43;"is some of the Malcolm S output I'm the most familiar with"
09:43;09:45;"is his first solo album."
09:45;09:47;"Pretty good record."
09:47;09:48;"Yeah."
09:48;09:50;"Because I had an internship--"
09:50;09:51;"OK."
09:51;09:53;"--at Matador Records when I was in high school."
09:53;09:54;"You did?"
09:54;09:56;"I took the train and--"
09:56;09:57;"Really?"
09:57;09:58;"What year was this?"
09:58;10:03;"I think it was summer '01, just before 9/11."
10:03;10:04;"Wow."
10:04;10:06;"And I remember some of the records that had come out"
10:06;10:10;"around that time were like Magui, Stephen Malcolm's solo."
10:10;10:12;"I just remember he had a song on his--"
10:12;10:14;"so like I wasn't that big of a pavement head."
10:14;10:16;"I liked some songs, but then suddenly I"
10:16;10:18;"had a CD of his first solo album."
10:18;10:19;"So I listened to that a bunch."
10:19;10:21;"I just like knew it."
10:21;10:23;"And he had a song called ""Pink India,"""
10:23;10:26;"which I feel like had a little bit of like some history"
10:26;10:28;"lesson vibes, too."
10:28;10:33;"(SINGING) A long time ago in China, I am told."
10:33;10:36;"All I'm saying is, honestly, if you played that for me"
10:36;10:38;"and you didn't tell me what it was,"
10:38;10:40;"I would totally have guessed that might have been something"
10:40;10:44;"that came out on Merge or Matador,"
10:44;10:46;"one of the '90s labels."
10:46;10:47;"I don't know."
10:47;10:49;"There was something-- it's hard to put my finger on."
10:49;10:51;"There was something in like the drumming or--"
10:51;10:52;"The drum sound."
10:52;10:55;"Like there's like they're referencing like kind"
10:55;10:58;"of uncool like pop punk in a way."
10:58;10:59;"Maybe."
10:59;11:02;"That wouldn't pass the sniff test at Matador."
11:02;11:04;"Well, maybe not Matador."
11:04;11:06;"Maybe Merge."
11:06;11:08;"But I don't want to-- here's the thing."
11:08;11:09;"I'm actually very familiar--"
11:09;11:10;"Merge is tight."
11:10;11:13;"I know they're tight, but I'm very familiar with Matador."
11:13;11:14;"Yeah."
11:14;11:15;"And I'm not that familiar with Merge,"
11:15;11:17;"so I might be totally off."
11:17;11:19;"I was very excited to intern at Matador."
11:19;11:21;"I made a bunch of photocopies."
11:21;11:24;"But I was ahead because at that time--"
11:24;11:25;"Bell and Sebastian, right?"
11:25;11:26;"Bell and Sebastian."
11:26;11:28;"I was a big Bell and Sebastian head at the time."
11:28;11:31;"And of course, they had an incredible run in the '90s,"
11:31;11:32;"and they're still killing it."
11:32;11:36;"And then so much, much later--"
11:36;11:37;"well, let's say six years later."
11:37;11:40;"I graduated high school, went to college, started a band."
11:40;11:41;"And then we ended up on XL."
11:41;11:43;"And at that point, XL and Matador"
11:43;11:44;"were under the same roof."
11:44;11:46;"They're still different labels, but they both"
11:46;11:47;"are part of the Beggars group."
11:47;11:50;"And I like started going to meet XL."
11:50;11:51;"And I saw--"
11:51;11:53;"I reintroduced myself to a couple of the Matador people."
11:53;11:55;"I was like, oh, yeah, I used to--"
11:55;11:56;"I entered there."
11:56;11:57;"A couple of them were like, oh, [BLEEP] yeah."
11:57;11:58;"Sounds kind of familiar."
11:58;12:02;"Was there any discussion about Vampire ending up on Matador?"
12:02;12:04;"No, I don't remember ever talking to them."
12:04;12:07;"So I just assume they weren't interested."
12:07;12:08;"And I don't know why."
12:08;12:10;"I guess hindsight's 20/20."
12:10;12:14;"But to me, we just so obviously didn't belong on Matador."
12:14;12:15;"Why is that?"
12:15;12:21;"I mean, I don't really have a sense of Matador circa 2007, 2008."
12:21;12:26;"I don't-- like, I tapped out around on Matador in early twos."
12:26;12:28;"I guess probably the way that we felt,"
12:28;12:32;"and probably they might have felt too, that there was something--"
12:32;12:34;"I think the early Vampire weekend, we were trying"
12:34;12:36;"to extricate ourselves from the--"
12:36;12:37;"'90s?"
12:37;12:39;"From-- yeah, from classic '90s."
12:39;12:41;"Like, at the time--"
12:41;12:43;"you know, and I liked a lot of that stuff,"
12:43;12:46;"but I felt very disconnected from Pavement."
12:46;12:50;"If Pavement was the archetypal '90s Matador band,"
12:50;12:52;"that felt like a totally different tradition"
12:52;12:54;"than what we were doing."
12:54;12:58;"There was also something kind of maybe poppy about us"
12:58;13:01;"that, even though it doesn't make that much sense either,"
13:01;13:03;"XL was always the dream label."
13:03;13:05;"And they also happened to be interested in us,"
13:05;13:06;"so mutually--"
13:06;13:08;"No, yeah, I can see that."
13:08;13:10;"You didn't want to be label mates with Cat Power?"
13:10;13:12;"No, I love Cat Power."
13:12;13:15;"I don't think-- nobody was interested in us at Matador,"
13:15;13:17;"just to be clear."
13:17;13:20;"I think, like, the labels that I remember talking to--"
13:20;13:21;"you know what?"
13:21;13:24;"A lot of them were English, whatever you want to make of that."
13:24;13:26;"A lot of the labels that we talked to a lot"
13:26;13:31;"were like XL, Rough Trade, Bit of Domino."
13:31;13:34;"And sometimes we would talk to their American office,"
13:34;13:38;"but they-- I don't know, there tended to be more of a"
13:38;13:40;"""they got us and we got them"" kind of vibe,"
13:40;13:42;"I think, with some of the English labels."
13:42;13:45;"Got it. So it wasn't like an MC Paul Barman thing."
13:45;13:47;"Wait, was MC Paul Barman on Matador?"
13:47;13:48;"Apparently."
13:48;13:49;"Oh, yeah."
13:49;13:51;"Is Malchmus still on Matador?"
13:51;13:54;"Yes. Yeah, Malchmus and the Jicks"
13:54;13:57;"are still Matador artists as are--"
13:57;13:59;"That's deep. He's like 30 years deep on Matador."
13:59;14:02;"Queens of the Stone Age, you got Yola Tango,"
14:02;14:05;"Kim Gordon, Pavement also still on Matador,"
14:05;14:07;"Interpol."
14:07;14:08;"Oh, really?"
14:08;14:09;"Oh, yeah, Interpol."
14:09;14:10;"Apparently."
14:10;14:11;"Thinking about how Paul started on Matador,"
14:11;14:13;"then went to a major, then came back."
14:13;14:15;"I mean, it's an incredible label."
14:15;14:18;"And you know, the dude who started it,"
14:18;14:21;"he's quoted heavily in ""Our Band Could Be Your Life"""
14:21;14:24;"because he was in high school--"
14:24;14:25;"what's his name? Cosloy."
14:25;14:26;"He was writing--"
14:26;14:27;"Gerard."
14:27;14:32;"Gerard. He had a zine from a young age,"
14:32;14:36;"probably put on Sonic Youth shows."
14:36;14:37;"Who knows?"
14:37;14:39;"Yeah. Speaking of ""Our Band Could Be Your Life,"""
14:39;14:42;"did you get your copy of the Nirvana book?"
14:42;14:44;"I did. Shout out to Michael Azarad."
14:44;14:46;"I'm very excited to dig into it."
14:46;14:48;"I got my copy as well."
14:48;14:51;"It's a tome. It's a serious volume."
14:51;14:52;"Well, that's a big old book."
14:52;14:54;"Yeah. We'll have him on at some point."
14:54;14:55;"Yeah, yeah. Let's read it."
14:55;14:58;"Let's do ""Come as You Are Book Club."""
14:58;15:01;"Azarad should do ""Our Band Could Be Your Life 2,"""
15:01;15:04;"but it's about more like Marcy Playground-type bands."
15:04;15:10;"He did the 12 indie bands that paved the way for Nirvana,"
15:10;15:13;"that connective tissue between the '70s punk"
15:13;15:16;"and the '90s alternative explosion."
15:16;15:17;"Yeah."
15:17;15:19;"I think it'd be cool to do post-Nirvana,"
15:19;15:26;"just the story of 12 bands who had brief careers"
15:26;15:29;"post-Nirvana or who did something kind of interesting,"
15:29;15:36;"but in the kind of weird post-Nirvana major indie whatever."
15:36;15:38;"Right, because ""Our Band Could Be Your Life"" was..."
15:38;15:41;"I think the main criteria was you didn't sign to a major."
15:41;15:45;"People were always like, ""Why is REM not in 'Our Band Could Be Your Life'?"""
15:45;15:47;"They started on a major."
15:47;15:48;"Yeah, you couldn't start on a major."
15:48;15:49;"That was the rule for..."
15:49;15:50;"Yeah, I guess that's right,"
15:50;15:52;"because Sonic Youth and stuff signed to Geffen."
15:52;15:53;"And the replacements."
15:53;15:54;"Of course."
15:54;15:57;"But yeah, it'd be funny to do the '90s version of..."
15:57;16:00;"It has to be bands that started only on majors,"
16:00;16:02;"or they started on majors."
16:02;16:04;"Weezer, Marcy Playground."
16:04;16:05;"Candlebox."
16:05;16:07;"Couldn't be Green Day."
16:07;16:08;"Yeah, can't be Green Day."
16:08;16:10;"A lot of people were asking, ""Why is Green Day not in this book?"""
16:10;16:14;"And also, I think in the same way that ""In Our Band Could Be Your Life,"""
16:14;16:18;"which if any TC heads have never read that book,"
16:18;16:20;"that's a real classic."
16:20;16:24;"In that book, I would say the average TC listener picking it up,"
16:24;16:27;"you're going to know at least 50% of the bands."
16:27;16:29;"Everybody's heard of Sonic Youth."
16:29;16:33;"Definitely heard of Dinosaur Jr. if you listen to this show"
16:33;16:36;"and you're familiar with Jake's taste."
16:36;16:38;"But then you're going to get into Beat Happening."
16:38;16:39;"Sure."
16:39;16:40;"Do you know Beat Happening?"
16:40;16:42;"Seinfeld, do you know Beat Happening?"
16:42;16:43;"No, what is that?"
16:43;16:45;"That's a band that could be your life."
16:45;16:47;"You know who Calvin Johnson is?"
16:47;16:49;"Oh, that rings a bell."
16:49;16:51;"K Records."
16:51;16:52;"Oh, yeah, okay."
16:52;16:56;"It kind of runs the gamut from these kind of household alternative names"
16:56;16:59;"to ones that are well-known within indies,"
16:59;17:03;"Beat Happening, Mission of Burma, that--"
17:03;17:05;"Mission of Burma was one of those where I was like,"
17:05;17:07;"""I do not know this band."""
17:07;17:10;"I remember Tomás from Phoenix was not familiar with Beat Happening."
17:10;17:12;"I remember we were doing a little bit of--"
17:12;17:13;"Were they on the list?"
17:13;17:16;"Yeah, we were doing a '90s rundown, and I was like,"
17:16;17:17;"""Hey, do you like Got It by Voices?"""
17:17;17:19;"And he was like, ""Who?"""
17:19;17:20;"And then, yeah, he was--"
17:20;17:22;"And then I somehow beat Happening came up, and he was like,"
17:22;17:24;"""What's that? I've never heard of that."""
17:24;17:26;"And I was kind of, like, honestly shocked."
17:26;17:27;"Interesting."
17:27;17:29;"Yeah, just didn't cross the pond, I guess."
17:29;17:32;"But I guess in our band could be your life too,"
17:32;17:35;"it's also going to run the gamut from a Weezer,"
17:35;17:37;"kind of more like household name,"
17:37;17:39;"to a Marcy playground where people are like,"
17:39;17:41;"""Wait, who are-- I'm not sure I remember them."""
17:41;17:42;"Then it's like, well, Sex and C--"
17:42;17:44;"Oh, [bleep] yeah, of course I know that song."
17:44;17:46;"I don't know, Candlebox?"
17:46;17:49;"Yeah, or like Third Eye Blind, you know?"
17:49;17:52;"The story of Creed?"
17:52;17:55;"Oh, last chapter, Creed."
17:55;17:57;"Maybe by the time you get to Creed,"
17:57;17:58;"we're kind of like losing the plot."
17:58;18:00;"It should be bands that--"
18:00;18:02;"And also one criterion is that these bands"
18:02;18:06;"were familiar with indie music."
18:06;18:07;"Right."
18:07;18:11;"Like, Scott Staff from Creed, it's very possible"
18:11;18:13;"he's never heard of Pavement in his life."
18:13;18:14;"I would bet."
18:14;18:16;"Rivers Cuomo knows who Pavement is."
18:16;18:17;"For sure."
18:17;18:19;"And also--"
18:19;18:20;"Wozniak knows."
18:20;18:21;"Are the bands in that book,"
18:21;18:22;"are they familiar with the bands from"
18:22;18:24;"Our Band Can Be Your Life?"
18:24;18:25;"You know, Rivers Cuomo definitely knows"
18:25;18:28;"who the replacements in Diner So Junior are."
18:28;18:31;"Scott-- what's his name? Scott Stapp?"
18:31;18:32;"Scott Stapp."
18:32;18:33;"He might know the replacements."
18:33;18:35;"That wouldn't surprise me, but yeah."
18:35;18:36;"Yeah, maybe he would have caught"
18:36;18:38;"the Bastards of Young video on MTV"
18:38;18:41;"when he was growing up."
18:41;18:42;"Or maybe he'd surprise us."
18:42;18:43;"Maybe we're being judgmental,"
18:43;18:45;"and he would just be like,"
18:45;18:47;"""You know, Beat the Happenings"
18:47;18:49;"always put a smile on my face."
18:49;18:51;"My cousin gave me one of their tapes,"
18:51;18:53;"and yeah, you might not think it,"
18:53;18:55;"'cause I definitely, with Creed,"
18:55;18:57;"we're going for more of an anthemic big thing,"
18:57;19:00;"but yeah, that suits them."
19:00;19:01;"What I do suits me,"
19:01;19:04;"and that kind of lo-fi weird s--t,"
19:04;19:06;"that suits them, and I enjoy it."""
19:06;19:09;"You know what, I love all those SST bands."
19:09;19:11;"Minute Man, early Diner So Junior,"
19:11;19:13;"I mean, that stuff's, you know."
19:13;19:14;"I guess Black Flag is the one that,"
19:14;19:16;"who knows, maybe Scott Stapp is like,"
19:16;19:17;"""Oh yeah, f--king love Black Flag."""
19:17;19:19;"Oh, for sure, I could totally see that."
19:19;19:21;"I just want to throw out one more."
19:21;19:22;"Can we throw out Track 2"
19:22;19:24;"on the Marcy Playground record?"
19:24;19:26;"Have you heard this record before?"
19:26;19:28;"I don't think so."
19:28;19:30;"But I did always like Sex and Candy."
19:30;19:32;"Okay, guys, egg on my face,"
19:32;19:34;"turns out Track 2 is Sex and Candy."
19:34;19:35;"Let's go to Track 3."
19:35;19:37;"I just love how quiet the chorus is,"
19:37;19:39;"Sex and Candy, and everything drops out."
19:39;19:44;"electric guitar plays"
19:44;19:51;"Ancient walls of flowers"
19:51;19:55;"Tumbling down"
19:55;19:57;"Black cat, turtles,"
19:57;20:01;"And a smiling clown"
20:01;20:03;"I like to keep them"
20:03;20:07;"In a jar beside"
20:08;20:13;"Just enough to mess my mind inside"
20:13;20:15;"But I never heard you"
20:15;20:19;"Calling from the sun"
20:19;20:21;"Did you ever care"
20:21;20:23;"To shoot your silver gun?"
20:23;20:24;"I'm not mad at this."
20:24;20:25;"No, this is chill."
20:25;20:26;"Yeah."
20:26;20:28;"No, I never heard you"
20:28;20:32;"Calling from the moon"
20:32;20:33;"Did you ever care"
20:33;20:37;"To sing your free love to me?"
20:37;20:39;"Wow, this guy, John Wozniak,"
20:39;20:41;"went to Evergreen State College,"
20:41;20:43;"which is in Olympia, Washington."
20:43;20:45;"Oh, so he knows Beat Happening."
20:45;20:46;"In the mid '90s,"
20:46;20:48;"and then he went for two years,"
20:48;20:51;"and then he moved to New York."
20:51;20:53;"Yeah, I mean, Evergreen State College"
20:53;20:55;"is where, like, I think, like,"
20:55;20:57;"Cary Brownstein went there, and like..."
20:57;20:58;"Yeah, and Calvin Johns,"
20:58;21:00;"and Kurt was hanging out in Olympia."
21:00;21:01;"He didn't go there."
21:01;21:03;"He was hanging out in Olympia."
21:03;21:04;"But I never heard you"
21:04;21:06;"Were you guys like me in that you thought"
21:06;21:09;"the name was--the name Marcy Playground"
21:09;21:13;"was after the Brooklyn Marcy Projects?"
21:13;21:15;"Well, it occurred to me, yeah,"
21:15;21:18;"but I never really thought about it beyond that."
21:18;21:19;"But it's actually named after"
21:19;21:23;"the Marcy Open Grade School in Minneapolis."
21:23;21:26;"Oh, 'cause it's--is he from Minneapolis?"
21:26;21:28;"Uh, yeah."
21:28;21:30;"Yeah."
21:30;21:31;"Well, let's check out the solo."
21:31;21:34;"Also, this band is still going."
21:34;21:37;"Years active, '94 to present."
21:37;21:46;"If I pulled up on a new band,"
21:46;21:48;"and they're playing this song live..."
21:48;21:52;"Ooh, yeah, I would sign them."
21:52;21:54;"Nice."
21:54;21:57;"No, I never heard you calling"
21:57;22:00;"From the sun"
22:00;22:01;"Did you ever care"
22:01;22:04;"To shoot your silver gun"
22:04;22:06;"Come on, kids, you like--"
22:06;22:07;"you listen to Mac DeMarco,"
22:07;22:09;"but you can't give this a chance?"
22:09;22:10;"What?"
22:10;22:12;"Around 2000, I did a couple tours"
22:12;22:13;"with Calvin Johnson."
22:13;22:14;"Oh, when you were in--"
22:14;22:15;"playing with Wolf Turner?"
22:15;22:18;"Yeah, I used to know Calvin pretty well."
22:18;22:20;"He had a band called Dub Narcotic."
22:20;22:21;"Oh, what did they sound like?"
22:21;22:22;"Dub Narcotic Sound System."
22:22;22:23;"Oh."
22:23;22:24;"Um, it was kind of like--"
22:24;22:25;"man, throw in some Dub Narcotic."
22:25;22:26;"It was kind of like--"
22:26;22:27;"Sounded like beat happening?"
22:27;22:29;"Kind of like instrumental funk,"
22:29;22:30;"and then Calvin doing, like--"
22:30;22:31;"His low voice."
22:31;22:32;"No, it didn't sound like beat happening at all."
22:32;22:34;"It was like-- it was funky."
22:34;22:36;"At least that's my recollection."
22:36;22:37;"I haven't heard it in years."
22:37;22:39;"And then Calvin doing his weird kind of Calvin--"
22:39;22:40;"Innocent, oh, dear."
22:40;22:44;"Yeah, kind of David Byrne kind of vibe."
22:44;22:45;"But yeah, I was in Wolf Kernel."
22:45;22:47;"We did a few tours."
22:47;22:50;"It was Wolf Kernel, The Microphones."
22:50;22:51;"Hmm."
22:51;22:53;"It's Dub Narcotic Sound System."
22:56;23:04;"OK, maybe funk's the wrong word."
23:04;23:06;"No, but yeah, 90s--"
23:06;23:07;"A little bit of the beat."
23:07;23:08;"--breakbeat plus indie."
23:08;23:09;"Yeah."
23:11;23:12;"Melodica."
23:19;23:39;"Yeah, I haven't seen Calvin in years, but he's a cool dude."
23:39;23:41;"He had so many crazy stories."
23:41;23:43;"He has a good vibe."
23:43;23:44;"Sounds pretty fresh."
23:44;23:45;"Yeah, I'm used to those Calvin--"
23:45;23:46;"Here we go."
23:46;23:47;"Oh, my god."
23:47;23:49;"Wait, what?"
23:49;23:50;"I hear the dub."
23:50;23:53;"You know, I don't think I've ever heard a dub narcotic recording."
23:53;23:57;"I've only just saw them live like 10 or 15 times."
23:57;23:58;"Maybe it was different."
23:58;24:01;"Wait, why don't we just throw on one beat happening song for Seinfeld"
24:01;24:03;"and for the listeners?"
24:03;24:04;"Yeah."
24:04;24:06;"I mean, the classic is Indian Summer."
24:06;24:08;"(SINGING) Welcome back for Indian Summer."
24:08;24:09;"Yeah, throw it on."
24:10;24:12;"Yeah, so this is like mid '80s."
24:16;24:23;"Breakfast in cemetery, boy tasting wild cherry,"
24:23;24:30;"touch girl, apple blossom, just a boy playing possum."
24:30;24:33;"Welcome back for Indian Summer."
24:33;24:37;"Welcome back for Indian Summer."
24:37;24:40;"Welcome back for Indian Summer."
24:40;25:07;"It's like owning the kind of cutesiness."
25:07;25:10;"I mean, Jonathan Richman maybe?"
25:10;25:11;"Oh yeah, right."
25:11;25:12;"That makes sense."
25:12;25:17;"I wouldn't call them velvets, twee, but they flirt with it occasionally."
25:17;25:21;"But yeah, Jonathan Richman seems like the real grandfather."
25:21;25:22;"Yeah."
25:22;25:32;"I touch your hem you say, let's stroll down Martin Way."
25:32;25:39;"Pick plums, abandon farm, who let norms come to harm."
25:39;25:43;"We'll come back for Indian summer."
25:43;25:46;"We'll come back for Indian summer."
25:46;25:49;"We'll come back for Indian summer."
25:49;25:53;"Then go our separate ways."
25:53;25:56;"Cover me with rain."
25:56;26:00;"Walk me down the lane."
26:00;26:03;"I'll drink from your drain."
26:03;26:04;"We will never change."
26:04;26:05;"Yeah, so it's always like very simple."
26:05;26:06;"Yeah, this sounds awesome."
26:06;26:07;"I haven't heard this in years."
26:07;26:08;"We'll come back for Indian summer."
26:10;26:11;"Then go our separate ways."
26:11;26:12;"Good vibe."
26:12;26:13;"Yeah."
26:13;26:14;"I'm just gonna play a little bit of this."
26:14;26:15;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
26:23;26:30;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
26:30;26:31;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
26:47;26:53;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
26:53;26:54;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
27:10;27:16;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
27:16;27:17;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
27:33;27:39;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
27:39;27:40;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
28:14;28:38;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
28:38;28:45;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
28:45;28:50;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
28:50;28:54;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
28:54;28:57;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
29:33;29:35;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
29:35;29:38;"I'm gonna play a little bit of this."
37:44;37:47;"Okay, so you can do a two for Tuesday."
37:47;37:50;"I would even make the case that these are like, for '81,"
37:50;37:53;"these are like pretty influential '80s recordings."
37:53;37:56;"Like, I can see George Michael listening to this"
37:56;37:59;"and then light riding Jitterbug."
37:59;38:02;"I would have guessed this was '84."
38:02;38:05;"Yeah. This mix of like the old-fashioned organ"
38:05;38:08;"but with the '80s drums, it's also, you know,"
38:08;38:11;"before Bruce made songs that sounded like this,"
38:11;38:14;"before Dire Straits was doing Walk of Life,"
38:14;38:17;"before Wham!"
38:17;38:20;"♪"
38:23;38:26;"I bet Bruce and John Landau heard this in '81"
38:26;38:29;"and they sat up and they were like, ""Okay,"
38:29;38:32;"Jake Iles is not messing around."""
38:32;38:35;"Bruce, it's me, John Landau."
38:35;38:38;"Come over to my apartment, we gotta listen to this record."
38:38;38:41;"♪"
38:44;38:47;"Mark Knopfer's like, ""Man, have you heard this new Jake Iles?"""
38:47;38:50;"It's unbelievable."
38:50;38:53;"♪"
38:53;38:56;"And it's good old-fashioned songwriting,"
38:56;38:59;"like these cool mum-bum-bum."
38:59;39:02;"♪"
39:02;39:05;"Also, Huey Lewis would have stood up."
39:05;39:08;"Yeah, before Huey Lewis. He would have been like, ""Okay."""
39:08;39:11;"Shot across the bow."
39:11;39:14;"Where's the Love for Freeze Frame by Jay Gausman? A masterpiece."
39:14;39:17;"♪"
39:17;39:20;"Now I'm curious about this whole record."
39:20;39:23;"I wonder if there's a good ballad on this record."
39:23;39:26;"Yeah, let's listen to track two, Rage in the Cage."
39:26;39:29;"♪"
39:38;39:41;"Same kind of energy."
39:41;39:44;"♪"
40:08;40:11;"Throw an angel in blue."
40:11;40:14;"It's track eight."
40:14;40:17;"♪"
40:23;40:26;"Oh, you know what else, Jake? This is the third single."
40:26;40:29;"Yeah, I had a feeling this was going to be a ballad."
40:29;40:32;"Sissy Houston and Luther Vandross appear on the song as backup vocalists."
40:32;40:35;"♪"
40:47;40:50;"I remember Chris Kyle was a fan of this."
40:50;40:53;"♪"
41:38;41:41;"His voice is totally different. This could be a Seeger song."
41:41;41:44;"Yeah."
41:44;41:47;"This could have been off ""Against the Wind,"" which is 1980."
41:47;41:50;"Yeah."
41:50;41:53;"Or, you know, it's not a million miles from the river."
41:53;41:56;"♪"
42:02;42:05;"I swear, man, the river's the one I've been coming back to the most"
42:05;42:08;"with Bruce the last couple of years."
42:08;42:11;"Interesting."
42:11;42:14;"Yeah, like, uh, like, ""Deep Side 2"" river."
42:14;42:17;"Yeah. No, I feel you."
42:17;42:20;"The river is--I've gone back to that a lot."
42:20;42:23;"Dude, point blank. Yeah."
42:23;42:26;"♪"
42:41;42:44;"Yeah, in my late--mid to late 30s,"
42:44;42:47;"the river's been my Bruce album."
42:47;42:50;"There's also a slight--that was a slight inspiration"
42:50;42:53;"for ""Father of the Bride."" I thought of that as being our--our ""The River."""
42:53;42:56;"Oh, that's cool. Yeah."
42:56;42:59;"'Cause I just love--I love that it has that mix of, like,"
42:59;43:02;"the, like, Sherry darlings"
43:02;43:05;"and ""Little girl, I wanna marry you."""
43:05;43:08;"And then just, like--but then, like, the song ""The River"""
43:08;43:11;"or, like, yeah, those kind of, like,"
43:11;43:14;"back half ballads. Yeah."
43:14;43:17;"""Stolen Car."" Yeah."
43:17;43:20;"Yeah, for a while, I was deep on that, like, funnel love kick"
43:20;43:23;"and, uh,"
43:23;43:26;"yeah, I just--I just--"
43:26;43:29;"I probably listen to ""The River,"" like, I don't know,"
43:29;43:32;"half a dozen times a year, kind of like my Snickers consumption."
43:32;43:35;"[laughs]"
43:35;43:38;"Speaking of, I might crack into the Snickers."
43:38;43:41;"Get into that Snickers."
43:41;43:44;"I don't know why I texted this to Jake."
43:44;43:47;"This is the kind of stupid stuff that pops into my head"
43:47;43:50;"as a fan of rock music. I just can't--for some reason,"
43:50;43:53;"this very specific idea popped into my head."
43:53;43:56;"What if ""Centerfold"" was on ""Born in the USA""?"
43:56;43:59;"Right. It just cracked me up."
43:59;44:02;"""Born in the USA"" is--"
44:02;44:05;"is a lot of these songs that are written from the perspective of, like,"
44:05;44:08;"a 30-something dude in the '80s."
44:08;44:11;"There's a lot of wistfulness on ""Born in the USA."""
44:11;44:14;"You know, like, basically, I think there's a kinship with ""Glory Days."""
44:14;44:17;"And, you know, ""Glory Days"" also is about"
44:17;44:20;"idealizing the past, right?"
44:20;44:23;"So the guy in ""Centerfold,"" he's talking about his homeroom angel,"
44:23;44:26;"and then he has to come to terms with, like, damn, things have changed."
44:26;44:29;"Now she's in the nudie mag."
44:29;44:32;"Although he comes to terms and he says, ""You know what?"""
44:32;44:35;"I think he almost implies that he's ready to ask her out now."
44:35;44:38;"""Hey, why don't we go out? Let's go to a motel."""
44:38;44:41;"Yeah, I feel like he goes on a flight of fancy of, like, ""I'm gonna go to a motel with her."""
44:41;44:44;"But you're right. I mean, ""Glory Days,"" it's like--"
44:44;44:47;"I love the, like, ""I'm walking into the bar, the guy's walking out."""
44:47;44:50;"Yeah."
44:50;44:53;"We go back in, he sits down, all he keeps talking about is ""Glory Days."""
44:53;44:56;"And also with the organ, the vibe is so similar."
45:17;45:20;"This is Bruce Walkby."
45:20;45:21;"Hey, man!"
45:21;45:24;"Basically, Bruce ran into the Kenny Powers of his high school."
45:24;45:25;"[laughs]"
45:25;45:30;"It's like, ""Sh*t, man! You have one of the best arms I've ever seen."
45:30;45:33;"What the hell are you doing here?"""
45:33;45:35;"Easily the best arm in central New Jersey."
45:35;45:39;"[laughs]"
45:39;45:43;"I saw you pitch a no-hitter against--"
45:43;45:44;"How fast do you think you were throwing?"
45:44;45:47;"Oh, you know, mid-80s?"
45:47;45:51;"Like, not even remotely close enough to be competitive."
45:51;45:53;"[laughs]"
45:53;45:56;"It's scary still if you're a high schooler."
45:56;45:57;"Sure."
46:06;46:08;"Has it been two years already? Holy cow."
46:15;46:17;"""Glory Days."""
46:17;46:25;"So, these characters, their glory days was when they were juniors and seniors in high school."
46:25;46:28;"And now they're 35."
46:28;46:32;"So it's 17 years before 1984."
46:32;46:34;"So it's like 1967."
46:34;46:36;"Yeah."
46:36;46:39;"That these kids are in their glory days."
46:39;46:43;"67 of teenage children."
46:43;46:46;"Yeah, imagine if the breakdown verse was like,"
46:46;46:51;"""I'm gonna go down to the porno shop, gonna grab a nudie magazine."""
46:51;46:55;"[laughs]"
46:55;47:00;"Bruce just wants to clear his mind, so he goes to get a nudie magazine."
47:00;47:03;"And he's just sitting back."
47:03;47:05;"He starts flipping through it."
47:05;47:06;"And he can't believe it."
47:06;47:09;"It's his homeroom angel in there."
47:09;47:11;"Wow."
47:11;47:15;"It's not dignified enough for Bruce."
47:15;47:17;"It's so similar, but like--"
47:17;47:20;"It's too explicitly horny."
47:20;47:24;"[laughs]"
47:24;47:28;"Yeah, ""Centerfold"" is just the hornier version of ""Glory Days."""
47:28;47:31;"I mean, obviously, a lot of the--we were texting about this a little bit."
47:31;47:35;"A lot of the Bruce songs are sung from the point of view of a character,"
47:35;47:41;"but I still can't picture a character in a Bruce song looking at a porno mag."
47:41;47:45;"[laughs]"
47:45;47:49;"I could picture Bruce going, ""My blood runs cold!"
47:49;47:51;"My memory has just been sold!"""
47:51;47:54;"Oh, for sure."
47:54;47:58;"Yeah, one of the Bruce characters on ""Born in the USA"" is working construction,"
47:58;48:02;"and he finds some pornos on the construction site."
48:02;48:06;"When I was a kid, we would almost find porno mags."
48:06;48:10;"Also, I like just using the term ""porno mag."""
48:10;48:14;"We would find porno mags in the most inexplicable places, man."
48:14;48:17;"Like a new subdivision's being built, we'd go check it out on a Sunday."
48:17;48:24;"The house is all framed with the Tyvek wrap on it and the toilets installed."
48:24;48:30;"It was still all plywood and 2x4s, and there'd be a hustler on the ground."
48:42;48:46;"There's a poignant version. It's some Holden Caulfield kind of just like,"
48:46;48:50;"""There's nothing sacred, man."""
48:50;48:55;"Then he has a Travis Bickle moment where he's a total nut,"
48:55;48:59;"just like, ""My homeroom angel, I need to protect her."""
48:59;49:02;"Just like, ""She was so pure."""
49:02;49:04;"He drives into Times Square."
49:04;49:06;"Yeah, everything's dirty."
49:06;49:10;"It's not like a Travis Bickle thing, like, ""The city's filthy."""
49:10;49:15;"Wait, have you ever seen the late '70s Paul Schrader film ""Hardcore""?"
49:15;49:18;"Oh, yeah. I actually watched that within the last year."
49:18;49:23;"Where George C. Scott, his Christian, Midwestern daughter,"
49:23;49:27;"goes missing on a class trip to disgusting Los Angeles,"
49:27;49:30;"and then he finds out that she's been taken into the porno world."
49:30;49:33;"He has to go out to find his daughter."
49:33;49:37;"I guess that's a little more hardcore, no pun intended,"
49:37;49:42;"than just seeing your high school crush as the centerfold."
49:42;49:48;"But yeah, you could see this kind of like more like kind of twisted, unhinged dude"
49:48;49:52;"just being like, ""This is disgusting. What's happening to my country?"
49:52;49:54;"My angel as the centerfold?"""
49:54;49:58;"And again, that's why that line is so funny."
49:58;49:59;"""My blood runs cold."""
50:00;50:04;"That could be like in a different song, could be really intense."
50:04;50:07;"""My blood runs cold. My memory has just been sold."""
50:07;50:09;"That could be an Paul Schrader script."
50:09;50:12;"And then we were talking about on ""Born in the USA,"""
50:12;50:16;"I guess the song that's the most sexual is ""I'm on Fire."""
50:16;50:20;"That gets more into like, maybe Travis Bickle goes too far,"
50:20;50:24;"but that gets into like the slightly disturbed mind."
50:24;50:25;"I don't know."
50:25;50:31;"For some reason, ""I'm on Fire"" almost makes me picture like the Joker movie or something."
50:31;50:33;"Let's throw that on."
50:33;50:36;"And actually in the video for ""I'm on Fire,"""
50:36;50:42;"Bruce is working on a car and there's kind of like a hot woman drops off her car"
50:42;50:45;"and he kind of gets the impression she's into him."
50:45;50:47;"And then he almost like goes up to her door."
50:47;50:51;"He almost knocks on the door and then he like walks away."
50:51;50:55;"And it kind of, it has like this vibe of almost like,"
50:55;50:57;"I mean, he's like this weird frustrated dude."
50:57;51:02;"It's like, it's like, it's almost like it's in his imagination or something."
51:02;51:05;"Is this proto-incel?"
51:05;51:06;"It's a little incel."
51:06;51:08;"God, this song is amazing."
51:17;51:19;"I love how fast it is."
51:31;51:34;"I've got a bad desire, I'm on fire."
51:43;51:44;"But it feels like it's all in his head."
51:44;51:47;"He's not actually saying this to anybody."
51:47;51:51;"He's like, he just shaved a Mohawk and he's staring in the mirror."
51:51;51:53;"That's what I, the vibe I get."
51:53;51:58;"Yeah, because isn't, doesn't Travis have a crush on like Cybil Shepherd or something?"
51:58;51:59;"The taxi driver?"
51:59;52:00;"Yes."
52:00;52:02;"He likes Caesar."
52:02;52:05;"He's so weird and he's, yeah."
52:05;52:06;"Right."
52:06;52:08;"Very strange, powerful film."
52:23;52:26;"Oh yeah, I just realized, that's why I'm saying all this is because of that line."
52:34;52:35;"Wow."
52:35;52:37;"This is, yeah, this is up there."
52:37;52:42;"It's a beautiful, eerie song, but I don't think I ever thought about those lines."
52:42;52:47;"The, at night I wake up with the sheet soaking wet and a freight train running through the middle of my head."
52:47;52:53;"It's not like, it's not like at night I wake up and I think about how much I love you."
52:53;52:56;"And then I wake up with this like pain in my heart because I miss you."
52:56;52:59;"He's talking to me, the sheets are soaking wet."
52:59;53:02;"It's like he wakes up in a cold sweat and a freight train."
53:02;53:06;"I'm like picturing just like a tortured dude."
53:06;53:09;"Yeah, and he's having like night terrors."
53:09;53:10;"Yeah, he's alone."
53:10;53:12;"He's, she's not in the bed next to him."
53:12;53:14;"And yeah, it's like someone took a knife."
53:14;53:15;"I don't think he even knows her."
53:15;53:16;"He doesn't know her."
53:16;53:20;"It's like someone took a knife, edgy and dull."
53:20;53:24;"What is it and cut a six inch valley in the middle of my skull."
53:24;53:26;"Ouch."
53:26;53:29;"No, it's like, it's like he's about to like trepanate himself."
53:29;53:33;"There's like, there's something really weird and violent beneath the surface."
53:33;53:41;"I don't think he's going to like do anything to the woman he's addressing, but it's like, it almost seems like he's like, I'm f***ing crazy."
53:41;53:43;"There's something wrong with me."
53:43;53:45;"There's something in my mind, man."
53:45;53:47;"It's great. And he rides right to that line."
53:47;53:55;"But so the last thing you'd want for the character and I'm on fire is to go down to the porno shop and, and see his homeroom angel."
53:55;53:58;"Oh yeah, then it's game over."
53:58;53:59;"That would be it."
53:59;54:02;"My blood runs cold."
54:02;54:05;"My memory has just been sold."
54:05;54:07;"Bruce should cover Centerfold."
54:07;54:09;"I would love to know what he thinks about Centerfold."
54:09;54:10;"He probably loves it."
54:10;54:17;"This might be a fool's errand, but is Bruce on record ever talking about J. Giles Band or Centerfold or anything like that?"
54:17;54:20;"I'm doing a number crunch right now to look into this."
54:20;54:33;"Also like the idea of if rather than Glory Days being the most fun song on an 80s album about aging in a changing America, imagine if it was the least fun song."
54:33;54:48;"Like, like a really, and the rest of it was like, instead of stories about getting back from Vietnam or the proto incel anger of I'm on fire or the kind of like tragedy of my
hometown."
54:48;54:51;"It was more just like other songs, kind of like, like Centerfold."
54:51;54:54;"Just got like a little goofier."
54:54;54:55;"Yeah."
54:55;55:02;"So I'm talking, I'm checking with a friend of the show, chat GPT, and I've gotten a very cryptic response."
55:02;55:03;"Listen to this."
55:03;55:11;"Bruce Springsteen has made positive comments about the J. Giles Band, particularly about their live performances and their role in the rock music scene."
55:11;55:15;"He has praised their high energy shows and their ability to get audiences dancing."
55:15;55:21;"Then I asked for a source and chat GPT says, I don't have access to specific sources or interviews."
55:21;55:22;"So I don't know."
55:22;55:23;"Sketchy."
55:23;55:24;"Yeah, sketchy, right?"
55:24;55:25;"It's an emotional truth."
55:25;55:27;"What if she just drove back?"
55:27;55:29;"It's an emotional truth, man."
55:29;55:36;"A very confident and specific response with no primary sources to no, no source sources to back up."
55:36;55:37;"So I'm going Google."
55:37;55:40;"Um, let's see."
55:40;55:55;"Angel is a centerfold. Whoa, hang on. I found an article in the Asbury Park Press."
55:55;55:56;"Wow."
55:56;55:57;"Familiar with this publication?"
55:57;55:59;"I'm familiar with Asbury Park."
55:59;56:12;"All right. Well, 2019 music legends Bruce Springsteen and Peter Wolfe from the J. Giles Band shopped for music gear at the Mr. Music Store in the Alston section of
Boston Friday, January 25th."
56:12;56:15;"Quote, the two stopped in for a quick visit."
56:15;56:16;"According to Boston."
56:16;56:18;"He sat down."
56:18;56:21;"This is a real this is a real lid blower."
56:21;56:26;"So their buddies, him and the singer J. Giles Band going guitar."
56:26;56:32;"Mr. Music owner Tom Barone said to Boston.com, quote, he sat down and started playing guitar."
56:32;56:35;"Him and Peter were just jamming along, trying out some pedals."
56:35;56:40;"He just poked around, checked out all my stuff, sat there, shot the with the salesman."
56:40;56:46;"They jammed on centerfold on two unplugged Stratocasters for about 10 minutes."
56:46;56:48;"I wish I recorded it, man."
56:48;56:49;"It was sick."
56:49;57:00;"So, yeah, I'll send the article. But what's also very funny about this is that there's a photo in the article that seems to be taken from security camera footage of the of
the store."
57:00;57:02;"Like, it seems very that's tight."
57:02;57:03;"Other Matt sent it along."
57:03;57:11;"Check out that photo of an unsuspecting Bruce caught caught on camera, caught in 360 P."
57:11;57:15;"Oh, my God. Those guys with them to look so rough."
57:15;57:16;"Oh, yeah."
57:16;57:18;"That's Peter Wolfe in the back of Big Beard."
57:18;57:19;"Uh huh. Wow."
57:19;57:24;"I wonder if like low key centerfold was a huge inspiration for Bruce."
57:24;57:26;"I mean, it's I'd love to know the story."
57:26;57:28;"It almost could be a beautiful thing like Bruce here centerfold."
57:28;57:31;"And he's just like, I love this energy."
57:31;57:40;"I love this character based study of, you know, growing up and innocence lost and the interplay of the past and the present."
57:40;57:45;"I think I could take that energy into more of a concept album and make it a bit darker."
57:45;57:50;"That's more my kind of world. But but I'm really excited about this song."
57:50;57:57;"He clearly omitted that from Born to Run, his memoir in 2016, because that would've been amazing."
57:57;57:59;"There was just like three pages on centerfold."
57:59;58:10;"If he was just like after the relatively modest commercial performance of Nebraska, I found myself listening to one of my favorite records, Freeze Frame by the Jay
Giles Band."
58:10;58:15;"When track three hit centerfold, I knew no more f***ing around."
58:15;58:20;"I immediately sat down and wrote the whole Born to Run, the whole Born in the USA album."
58:20;58:22;"We started recording it the next day."
58:22;58:31;"Maybe there's some precedence for centerfold, but I'm I'm I still have this feeling that centerfold is like one of the most influential songs of the early 80s."
58:31;58:32;"Fully agree."
58:32;58:35;"All right, Jake, you want to tee up our guest today?"
58:35;58:42;"Author Carson Mel is about to call in. He called in, I don't know, three or four or five years ago."
58:42;58:44;"Right when Tarantula dropped."
58:44;58:45;"Right. He had a show."
58:45;58:46;"An animated TV show."
58:46;58:51;"Right. He has a new novel out called Cherry on Top."
58:51;59:05;"And it is his second novel exploring the character of Bobby Bird, who is a fictitious rock star who started in the late 60s and was releasing albums, you know, into the
80s."
59:05;59:08;"And I just felt like it'd be perfect for TC."
59:08;59:16;"And Bobby Bird is also like specifically like a kind of Southwest, like Arizona and L.A. based rock star."
59:16;59:28;"Kind of country rock. I'm kind of curious to pick Carson's brain a little bit about this, because the book Cherry on Top is about the recording of Bobby's biggest album."
59:28;59:31;"And he records it in Joshua Tree in 1978."
59:31;59:33;"Obviously, this is all fictitious."
59:33;59:40;"And it's it's also written from the point of view of a 74 year old Bobby Bird looking back."
59:40;59:42;"First person."
59:42;59:47;"Yeah, it's first person, but it's this character looking back 40 years prior."
59:47;59:51;"So I don't know. Let's call Carson. Let's let's get into the Bobby Bird universe."
59:51;59:52;"Yeah."
59:52;59:55;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
59:55;01:00:06;"What's up, dude?"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"Not much. How you doing?"
01:00:08;01:00:09;"Not bad."
01:00:09;01:00:13;"Thanks for having me on to talk about the new book. I really appreciate it."
01:00:13;01:00:25;"Of course. Yeah, I was just setting it up a little. I said it's written from the point of view of Bobby Bird when he was in his 70s, looking back at his life when he was in his
30s. Is that right?"
01:00:25;01:00:30;"Yeah, I think. Yeah, definitely. He's 70 something in the book here. I have a copy right here."
01:00:30;01:00:40;"He's recording the album in Joshua Tree 1978, which obviously that immediately piqued my interest. I was like, OK, Joshua Tree 1978."
01:00:40;01:00:46;"I immediately thought, I mean, let's like maybe you could describe Bobby Bird to the audience."
01:00:46;01:00:59;"Because like if you say 70s Joshua Tree, I think of the Eagles doing their first record cover shoot in Joshua Tree in the early 70s. And then, of course, Grant Parson
spending time there and then dying there in 1970."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"Yeah."
01:01:00;01:01:04;"And, you know, the whole thing with his body. So this is a few years later."
01:01:04;01:01:10;"Yeah, but he's wearing nudie suits out there. So there's definitely the Parsons influence."
01:01:10;01:01:29;"I think originally I wanted to write a book about an artist recording an album who owed his label an album and just was spending all this time looking for UFOs, which I
think is like the Grant Parson story out there, or at least a version of it that I've heard. And then that didn't have a plot at all or a story."
01:01:29;01:01:43;"So that kind of faded away and then it became this book, Cherry on Top. But yeah, Bobby Bird was born in '45. So yeah, in the late 70s, like '32."
01:01:43;01:01:48;"That's the classic year if you're a 60s and 70s rock star to be born."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"'45? Yeah."
01:01:49;01:01:51;"Well, yeah, some of them are a little bit earlier."
01:01:51;01:02:02;"They're all born between, yeah, it depends. But the people born between '41 and '49, that's just about everybody."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"Yeah. Yeah, you got to be a boomer."
01:02:04;01:02:07;"Early boomer."
01:02:07;01:02:10;"Yeah, because Tom Petty was a little older."
01:02:10;01:02:16;"He was born in 1950. So he's just barely out of the 40s."
01:02:16;01:02:21;"I remember reading that scene in the five and being like, wait, what?"
01:02:21;01:02:35;"Yeah, because I think Bruce is like 49 and then Tom, but they're the young guns. But yeah, Dylan, Jerry, the Beatles, the Stones, those guys are all 41 to 45 probably."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"Was Dylan 43?"
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Two."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"Maybe 41."
01:02:40;01:02:50;"He's not two because my dad is and I remember, I think he's 43 because I remember my dad being obsessed with Dylan and then me once being like, oh, he was younger than you."
01:02:50;01:02:51;"That's kind of cool."
01:02:51;01:02:53;"Okay, maybe 43."
01:02:53;01:03:14;"Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes. Warm evenings, pale mornings, bottled blues."
01:03:14;01:03:28;"And the tiny golden peers that she wore up in her hair."
01:03:28;01:03:36;"Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes."
01:03:36;01:03:49;"So you've done all sorts of writing, you've written books, you've written on a lot of great TV shows, you made your own TV shows, written great movie with Hannah Fidel,
Jake's wife, Long Dumb Road."
01:03:49;01:03:57;"Did you know you wanted to write a book or did the character Bobby Bird reach out and touch you and tell you which medium he belonged in?"
01:03:57;01:04:00;"Well, you know, the funny thing is it was a cartoon first."
01:04:00;01:04:09;"I did this back when there were DVDs. Do you remember this DVD that Mick Sweeney's put out called Wolfen?"
01:04:09;01:04:10;"By any chance?"
01:04:10;01:04:15;"I've heard of it. Yeah, spelled like dolphin with W-H."
01:04:15;01:04:22;"They were publishing a lot of my cartoons at the time and I had this idea to do a nude man covered in tattoos."
01:04:22;01:04:27;"You navigate the tattoos and he would tell you the story of each tattoo."
01:04:27;01:04:31;"I made that and it was called The Devil in Denim and it starred Bobby Bird."
01:04:31;01:04:34;"And these little vignettes were my way into knowing him."
01:04:34;01:04:42;"And then funnily enough, I had the phone number of an executive at Comedy Central."
01:04:42;01:04:48;"When I was really young, I pitched them something that they hated and I just called the number."
01:04:48;01:04:57;"The funny thing is the woman that I knew there, her name was Angela Howard, she didn't work there anymore but the number was still some new executive."
01:04:57;01:05:03;"So I explained who I was and I told him I made these cartoons with this old rock star."
01:05:03;01:05:05;"And he said, ""Well, write some longer scripts."""
01:05:05;01:05:11;"And then I started writing the scripts and they turned into a book and I never even called that dude back."
01:05:11;01:05:14;"Because it was just like they accumulated quickly."
01:05:14;01:05:19;"And then I made this book called Saguaro and that's Bobby Bird's life story."
01:05:19;01:05:23;"So that was a long time ago, like 2005."
01:05:23;01:05:27;"And I've been working with that character now for almost 20 years."
01:05:27;01:05:32;"So he's so entirely in my bones that it's very easy to make work with him."
01:05:32;01:05:34;"Which can be a good thing and a bad thing."
01:05:34;01:05:41;"But when I'm trying to work outside my comfort zone, I always come back and do some Bobby Bird stuff."
01:05:41;01:05:43;"How old are you, Carson?"
01:05:43;01:05:44;"43."
01:05:44;01:05:47;"What do you think it is about this era?"
01:05:47;01:05:51;"I'm asking you specifically, although I think it's true for all of us."
01:05:51;01:05:54;"What is it about this era that you feel so drawn to?"
01:05:54;01:05:59;"These guys from a different generation, the music of the 70s."
01:05:59;01:06:01;"What is it that you think draws you in so much?"
01:06:01;01:06:10;"I think it's sort of that fantasy of, well, for me, just the fantasy of being a rock star from that era specifically."
01:06:10;01:06:12;"Because it's so romantic, right?"
01:06:12;01:06:15;"I mean, I think we've all romanticized it."
01:06:15;01:06:21;"Ezra, I'm assuming when you were first getting into music, you were fantasizing about having that lifestyle, right?"
01:06:21;01:06:31;"Like just going on the road and maybe not getting sick on drugs."
01:06:31;01:06:39;"Well, yeah, I think as I've gotten older, I've found these kind of characters a little more interesting."
01:06:39;01:06:44;"Yeah, like probably when I was young, I was interested in the punk bands and stuff."
01:06:44;01:06:50;"But a kind of country rock guy in Southern California, I had to grow into that interest."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"Now I'm very interested."
01:06:51;01:06:58;"I feel like you got interested in that when we were doing this show."
01:06:58;01:07:05;"When we started doing Time Crisis, country rock from SoCal in the 70s was not on the menu for Ezra."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"Well, I always liked Flying Burrito Brothers."
01:07:07;01:07:11;"I randomly had their record that I got at a thrift store in high school."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"So I was always like, ""Oh, this is cool."""
01:07:13;01:07:17;"But I mean, honestly, Jake, even way before Time Crisis, when we first became friends,"
01:07:17;01:07:22;"you were the first person I met who was passionate about the Eagles, for instance."
01:07:22;01:07:23;"Right."
01:07:23;01:07:28;"So even that was probably a bit of a reframing for me."
01:07:28;01:07:31;"Well, and I guess, Carson, what is it about..."
01:07:31;01:07:39;"I know what you mean. Rock history, very enticing, the crazy lifestyles, the larger than life personalities."
01:07:39;01:07:44;"Zoom in a little more specifically, 1970s Southern California."
01:07:44;01:07:47;"What's appealing about that to you versus..."
01:07:47;01:07:51;"Well, Bobby Bird's actually from Phoenix. He's from my hometown."
01:07:51;01:07:59;"Which is, to me, just funny because artists don't usually come from Phoenix, other than Spielberg, I guess."
01:07:59;01:08:06;"And so, I mean, for me, I think in a lot of ways, too, it was just like, I'm not really a musician."
01:08:06;01:08:09;"I play guitar, but back then I didn't at all."
01:08:09;01:08:13;"I remember at one point, I think I called his guitar a five-string."
01:08:13;01:08:17;"That's how little I knew about music when I wrote the book."
01:08:17;01:08:23;"And so it was like a way to write about art without..."
01:08:23;01:08:29;"Because nobody... I'm kind of anti... I'm actually fully anti the writer as the protagonist."
01:08:29;01:08:32;"I don't like that. It just seems like a cop-out."
01:08:32;01:08:37;"And so I was like, well, how can I write about the creative process and all that stuff,"
01:08:37;01:08:44;"but make it completely alien to me and also in a realm where I worship it and it still has..."
01:08:44;01:08:47;"You know, you get too familiar with a god, I mean, with the art,"
01:08:47;01:08:53;"and then the practitioners of it can kind of lose that god-like glow."
01:08:53;01:08:58;"But because I didn't even know how to structure a song in any way, shape, or form,"
01:08:58;01:09:03;"songwriters and music performers were still like gods to me."
01:09:03;01:09:07;"So it felt like, okay, this guy's sort of like a god also."
01:09:07;01:09:11;"I really admire him. And then I could also make fun of him."
01:09:11;01:09:13;"Because that's sort of my comedy rule."
01:09:13;01:09:17;"Like, make fun of stuff you admire, not fun of stuff you hate,"
01:09:17;01:09:20;"because then you start to get too mean, you know?"
01:09:20;01:09:27;"Right. That's an interesting alternative take on when people talk about comedy shouldn't punch down."
01:09:27;01:09:30;"But to even look at comedy through that lens,"
01:09:30;01:09:34;"you have to have a pretty strong viewpoint of who's up, who's down."
01:09:34;01:09:36;"You have to have like... You have to understand that."
01:09:36;01:09:39;"So what you said actually takes all the guesswork out."
01:09:39;01:09:40;"Yeah."
01:09:40;01:09:43;"Rather than having to go to everybody's, ""Was that punching up or punching down?"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"Is that person above me or below me?"""
01:09:45;01:09:49;"Just say, ""If you hate it, don't get nasty."""
01:09:49;01:09:51;"Yeah, that's like..."
01:09:51;01:09:56;"Like in the first... In Saguaro, he... This is a spoiler, but in Saguaro, he tries to..."
01:09:56;01:10:02;"He meets Dylan in a bar in New York, and he tries to have a conversation with him."
01:10:02;01:10:06;"And Dylan gives him some of that early Dylan edge."
01:10:06;01:10:09;"And so Bobby Bird knocks him out."
01:10:09;01:10:17;"And then he feels really bad about it, because he realizes how much better of a songwriter this guy is than him."
01:10:17;01:10:22;"And if I had made that like Ted Nugent, I think the chapter would suck."
01:10:22;01:10:23;"You know what I mean?"
01:10:23;01:10:24;"Yeah."
01:10:24;01:10:27;"It would just have been like, ""And then he punched out Ted Nugent."""
01:10:27;01:10:28;"And we'd all cheer."
01:10:28;01:10:29;"Right."
01:10:29;01:10:30;"[Laughs]"
01:10:30;01:10:33;"What's the matter with me?"
01:10:33;01:10:36;"I don't have much to say."
01:10:36;01:10:45;"Daylight sneaking through the window, and I'm still in this all-night cafe."
01:10:45;01:10:54;"Walking to and fro beneath the moon, that's where the trucks are rolling slow."
01:10:54;01:11:01;"Sit down on this bank of sail and watch the river flow."
01:11:01;01:11:04;"So you're a desert man. You were born and raised in Phoenix?"
01:11:04;01:11:08;"Yeah, unfortunately. I lived there 22 years."
01:11:08;01:11:14;"So I'm looking forward to the next year where half my life is Phoenix-free."
01:11:14;01:11:16;"You've lived in LA for a long time."
01:11:16;01:11:18;"21 years, almost 22, yeah."
01:11:18;01:11:24;"You hate Phoenix, but you like the rough Southwest, Joshua Tree somewhere in between."
01:11:24;01:11:28;"Yeah, I like everything in Arizona except for Phoenix."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"And actually, Phoenix was cool through the '80s."
01:11:30;01:11:33;"It was like a community of desert rats."
01:11:33;01:11:37;"And then the Midwesterners who just wanted cheap property moved there."
01:11:37;01:11:40;"So it wasn't the interesting Midwesterners."
01:11:40;01:11:43;"It was people who were like, ""Oh, it's cheaper there. Let's go."""
01:11:43;01:11:46;"And then I think this happened--I only grew up in one town,"
01:11:46;01:11:50;"but it seemed like in the '90s it happened everywhere where everything became like"
01:11:50;01:11:53;"Bookstar, TGI Fridays, Chili's."
01:11:53;01:11:58;"I'm sure so many cities lost their character, but Phoenix definitely did."
01:11:58;01:12:03;"Before that, just people wanting to move somewhere warm and cheap,"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"kind of messing up the vibe."
01:12:05;01:12:09;"How would you describe that '80s and earlier Phoenix vibe?"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"What is the true desert rat energy?"
01:12:11;01:12:16;"I just remember going to dark, narrow Mexican restaurants"
01:12:16;01:12:19;"and eating in the back of them with my dad and brother."
01:12:19;01:12:23;"And I just remember a lot of empty lots."
01:12:23;01:12:30;"On the corner of my neighborhood, there was an empty lot that had a bright orange,"
01:12:30;01:12:35;"old-timey carriage in it that was called Graham's Fruit Stand."
01:12:35;01:12:38;"And you could go there and get shakes and smoothies."
01:12:38;01:12:42;"I don't think they were called smoothies, though. They're called fruit shakes."
01:12:42;01:12:46;"And they sold dates. And now that's condos."
01:12:46;01:12:50;"All that stuff is gone."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"It's crazy how much it's gone."
01:12:52;01:12:56;"I try to go to Mexican restaurants that me and my dad went to a decade ago,"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"and even those are gone."
01:12:58;01:13:03;"And now they all have what I call--as a derogatory term--"
01:13:03;01:13:05;"they're all sugar skull Mexican restaurants"
01:13:05;01:13:08;"with big emblems of sugar skulls on the front."
01:13:08;01:13:13;"That to me is a sign of you're not getting the real sh*t."
01:13:13;01:13:15;"What's a sugar skull?"
01:13:15;01:13:18;"A sugar skull is a skull made of sugar."
01:13:18;01:13:22;"They decorate with loop-de-loops and floral kind of stuff."
01:13:22;01:13:25;"Oh, yeah. It's kind of like Dia de los Muertos."
01:13:25;01:13:26;"Yeah, that's exactly what it is."
01:13:26;01:13:28;"It's like Disney's Coco."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"Yeah, exactly."
01:13:30;01:13:31;"Right. It's very Disney's Coco."
01:13:31;01:13:33;"You know what's funny, Carson?"
01:13:33;01:13:36;"You went to a great Mexican restaurant with your dad earlier this year."
01:13:36;01:13:38;"Was it a Morisco's one?"
01:13:38;01:13:42;"I don't remember, but I was in Phoenix in March of this year."
01:13:42;01:13:46;"I went there precisely for the reasons that Carson hates Phoenix."
01:13:46;01:13:53;"I was there to photograph Cheesecake Factory and Verizon stores around greater Phoenix."
01:13:53;01:13:58;"And then Carson's dad, Ed Mouw, is a renowned Arizona landscape painter."
01:13:58;01:14:00;"So we had things to talk about."
01:14:00;01:14:02;"Gradients and whatnot."
01:14:02;01:14:04;"Painting."
01:14:04;01:14:06;"Sky gradients."
01:14:06;01:14:11;"He did teach me how to do those when I was like 17."
01:14:11;01:14:13;"Yeah, no. Your dad's studio was amazing."
01:14:13;01:14:19;"It was a real repository of old Arizona ephemera and art."
01:14:19;01:14:24;"He turned me into a couple early 20th century watercolorists that lived there."
01:14:24;01:14:26;"Jimmy Swinerton."
01:14:26;01:14:34;"Yeah, and Gunnar Wydfros, who was a German man that lived in Arizona in the early 20th century."
01:14:34;01:14:41;"There was a lot of German artists that moved to the Southwest right around the turn of the century"
01:14:41;01:14:45;"and did amazing watercolor and woodblock work."
01:14:45;01:14:51;"My dad's studio has retained the '80s Phoenix vibe."
01:14:51;01:14:56;"I felt the weird old Arizona energy hanging out with your dad."
01:14:56;01:15:01;"What towns do you think have held on to that weird old Arizona energy the most?"
01:15:01;01:15:02;"Bisbee?"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"Oh, geez. Maybe, yeah."
01:15:04;01:15:06;"I've always heard about Bisbee. That sounds funky."
01:15:06;01:15:10;"Bisbee's funky. I mean, really anywhere outside of Phoenix."
01:15:10;01:15:11;"Tucson?"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"Tucson's great. I love Tucson."
01:15:13;01:15:18;"Too hot to move there, but if it was like 20 degrees cooler, I'd be there right now."
01:15:18;01:15:21;"But it's cooler than Phoenix."
01:15:21;01:15:27;"Way cooler because it doesn't have the—well, it's a little further—well, I don't know if that makes it cooler being further south."
01:15:27;01:15:34;"But I do know that the lack of endless concrete and asphalt keeps it cooler."
01:15:34;01:15:36;"I think it's higher elevation, too."
01:15:36;01:15:40;"I mean, on my trip there, I went to Phoenix and then I went to Tucson."
01:15:40;01:15:46;"And then there was a crazy snowstorm that happened in Tucson the night I was there."
01:15:46;01:15:54;"And then the next day, I went with my buddy down to this huge shopping center that was at the base of these mountains."
01:15:54;01:16:00;"And I got the most insane photographs of a red lobster with snowy mountains behind it."
01:16:00;01:16:06;"And, yeah, Tucson just felt like a completely different ecosystem than Phoenix."
01:16:06;01:16:11;"It is, yeah. It's retained the desert funk. Hardcore."
01:16:11;01:16:14;"And I think they have also—what's cool there is they have a giant telescope."
01:16:14;01:16:18;"So there's even laws against lights. So it's really dark at night."
01:16:18;01:16:22;"Oh. So, Carson, what do you think Bobby Bird would have thought of the Eagles?"
01:16:22;01:16:26;"I can't get a handle on what Bobby Bird actually sounds like."
01:16:26;01:16:34;"Well, Bobby Bird is—the joke on the back cover of Saguaro is he's the Bob right between Dylan and Seager."
01:16:34;01:16:39;"So that's what I imagine him like. Moments of greatness, but a lot of corn."
01:16:39;01:16:43;"I don't know how you feel about Seager, but I feel like he's pretty corny."
01:16:43;01:16:48;"I love Bob Seager. In fact, Ezra and I saw him at the Forum on his Farewell Tour."
01:16:48;01:16:54;"He's got a lot of boogie, kind of choo-gling rock songs that I could point out."
01:16:54;01:16:57;"But his ballads are like bar none."
01:16:57;01:17:00;"I think that's probably where Bobby Bird lives in that world."
01:17:00;01:17:06;"Where it's like a lot of—I mean, he would say as much that a lot of his work is just meeting contract requirements."
01:17:06;01:17:10;"Like he owes an album, so he makes an album. They're uninspired."
01:17:10;01:17:15;"He has like 45 songs about storms. That's like his go-to."
01:17:15;01:17:18;"He's always writing about monsoons and stuff."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"So yeah, he was like—"
01:17:19;01:17:20;"Was he making hits?"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"A pretty successful artist, but not a very good artist."
01:17:22;01:17:28;"Successful, but I think the good songs are good, and he knows when the bad songs are bad."
01:17:28;01:17:35;"And I think—he's like a very haunted man, and that's one of the things that haunts him is all the pabulum he's passed off over the years."
01:17:35;01:17:41;"He's always trying to find his way back to that place, that original spot of inspiration."
01:17:41;01:17:52;"We actually recorded a couple of his songs for the audio book of Cherry on Top, which came out before the book a couple years ago with Audible."
01:17:52;01:17:55;"Who published Cherry on Top? Oh, Secret Headquarters."
01:17:55;01:17:57;"Yeah, that comic shop."
01:17:57;01:17:59;"A local—oh, yeah."
01:17:59;01:18:06;"I sent Matt some YouTube links to the songs."
01:18:06;01:18:08;"Oh, yeah. I'll throw one on. I'd love to hear that."
01:18:08;01:18:09;"Yeah, throw it on."
01:18:09;01:18:12;"So do you feel like you—so you work with Jonathan Rado?"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"Yeah, yeah. He and I—"
01:18:14;01:18:15;"My J producer."
01:18:15;01:18:24;"He is great, and it's funny because he did it for me dirt cheap, and we actually recorded an album together as a band called Castle."
01:18:24;01:18:28;"C-A-S-L."
01:18:28;01:18:30;"Yeah, Castle's dope."
01:18:30;01:18:39;"This is the titular track from Cherry on Top."
01:18:39;01:18:41;"Is this the hit he writes?"
01:18:41;01:18:48;"This is the one that he can stand behind. He's happy with. And then he battles his way forward."
01:18:49;01:18:51;"Oh, yeah. I hear the cypher."
01:18:51;01:19:09;"Is that you singing?"
01:19:09;01:19:10;"Yeah."
01:19:10;01:19:12;"Oh, thanks."
01:19:12;01:19:19;"Is that you singing, of course?"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"That's me and Rado, yeah."
01:19:21;01:19:27;"So you get the idea."
01:19:27;01:19:30;"I'm digging it."
01:19:30;01:19:31;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:19:31;01:19:32;"Yeah, it sounds great."
01:19:32;01:19:46;"Yeah, Rado was perfect for it because he can emulate that '70s sound. And it was funny, the album we made together, I showed up and I was like, as if anyone would give a shit."
01:19:46;01:19:57;"I was like, ""Let's record the album in two days, so that'll be the legend of the album."" And he had all this brand new equipment, and he was like, ""Okay, we'll do it."""
01:19:57;01:20:09;"Because I think at the time he was 24, and he was like, you know, he's like a bandy little fella. And he's just like running around the studio with like spaghetti worth of
cords all over his shoulders and plugging things in."
01:20:09;01:20:15;"And I didn't know what he was doing like 90% of the time. And we actually got the album done in two days."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"Whoa."
01:20:16;01:20:26;"And he was learning how to use all that equipment at the time, too, his new stuff. And so it sounds a little gritty. And the vocals are kind of hard to make out, but we got it
done."
01:20:26;01:20:36;"There's a Castle song that I think about a lot. The one that's like, maybe it could have been a Bobby Bird song, the one that's like, you say you don't like Mexicans, but
you like Mexican food."
01:20:36;01:20:38;"Yeah."
01:20:38;01:20:40;"I saw the devil last night."
01:20:40;01:20:41;"Yeah, that's..."
01:20:41;01:20:44;"It's C-A-S-apostrophe-L."
01:20:44;01:20:57;"Yeah, which I didn't, it's funny, I didn't realize it after, until I named it, that it was an abbreviation of my name. And so it was kind of a fast, I pulled a fast one on
right out there. First two, last. Anyway."
01:20:57;01:20:58;"Wait, what do you mean?"
01:20:58;01:20:59;"Carson Mel."
01:20:59;01:21:00;"Oh, yeah."
01:21:00;01:21:03;"You know, it's like kind of like my name with the middle cut out."
01:21:03;01:21:29;"You say you don't like Mexicans. You say you don't like Mexicans at all. But you eat their food. You sing their songs. You eat their food. You sing their songs all right."
01:21:29;01:21:35;"I saw the devil last night. I saw the devil last night."
01:21:35;01:21:45;"You know, after you write a song, you realize what you ripped off and what you, I have a secret. I realized I ripped off that chorus."
01:21:45;01:21:47;"That's a good chorus."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"I saw the devil."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"Don't go on record, man."
01:21:49;01:21:53;"I'm going to get sued by Steve Mouthness."
01:21:53;01:22:01;"It's off with those awful toe rings from the end of Jenny and the S-Dog."
01:22:01;01:22:03;"Well, that's funny. We were talking about that record earlier."
01:22:03;01:22:04;"Really?"
01:22:04;01:22:07;"Yeah, we're talking about the first Mouthness record."
01:22:07;01:22:10;"Carson, what do you, do you like Marcy Playground?"
01:22:10;01:22:14;"I've never heard of them. I don't, wait, what is their hit? They have a hit, right?"
01:22:14;01:22:17;"Yeah, throw, Matt, can you throw on Marcy Playground's hit?"
01:22:17;01:22:20;"We're going in circles here."
01:22:20;01:22:23;"[Laughter]"
01:22:23;01:22:25;"Gone down the drains."
01:22:25;01:22:44;"I remember this too well. I hated it when it came out. I was way too Matador Records for this."
01:22:44;01:22:45;"There you go."
01:22:45;01:22:52;"Okay. But now, if you mix in the nostalgia factor, I like it."
01:22:52;01:22:56;"And it's just a good arrangement, like the dropout."
01:22:56;01:23:06;"I mean, but that is the, Sex and Candy is the corniest combo of that, right?"
01:23:06;01:23:07;"Yeah, you can change it."
01:23:07;01:23:08;"Yeah, literally."
01:23:08;01:23:16;"Wouldn't you say that it's an admirably restrained recording for a big hit? Big rock hit of the late 90s?"
01:23:16;01:23:22;"But it was the first hit, right? So, it was probably one of those unexpected hits, right?"
01:23:22;01:23:23;"Probably."
01:23:23;01:23:30;"It feels like it was like, you can lump this together with like, a little bit with like, Closing Time."
01:23:30;01:23:31;"Oh yeah."
01:23:31;01:23:33;"This is like Closing Time."
01:23:33;01:23:35;"Semi Sonic. They're going to my book."
01:23:35;01:23:40;"They probably drafted off of that song a little, with this hit."
01:23:40;01:23:44;"Well, this predates, but yeah, it's all the same zeitgeist."
01:23:44;01:23:46;"Carson, what do you think their influences are?"
01:23:46;01:23:48;"I can't give feedback to this."
01:23:48;01:23:49;"That's hard to say."
01:23:49;01:23:57;"I don't know. It's really hard to say. There's no other song like it, now that you've said that."
01:23:57;01:24:00;"All right. It stands on its own."
01:24:00;01:24:08;"Steelers Wheel? Kind of reminds me of that Steelers Wheel song from Reservoir Dogs."
01:24:08;01:24:10;"Stuck in the middle with you?"
01:24:10;01:24:16;"Yeah. Has a little bit of that bounce. A little gooey-ness."
01:24:16;01:24:20;"Should we do the top five? What should we do? Yeah, let's get into the top five."
01:24:20;01:24:27;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:24:27;01:24:29;"So Carson, you're going to join us for the top five, right?"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"Oh, cool. Yeah, that sounds great."
01:24:31;01:24:42;"So we asked you to pick a year. We're going to compare the top hits of right now on Apple Music with the top five Billboard hits this week in a certain year."
01:24:42;01:24:44;"And you picked 1968."
01:24:44;01:24:46;"I did that?"
01:24:46;01:24:52;"Yeah, you did. You said Bobby Byrd's first solo album was 1968."
01:24:52;01:24:54;"Oh, cool, cool. I didn't know."
01:24:54;01:24:56;"Maybe it wasn't clear why I was asking you that."
01:24:56;01:24:58;"No, I had no idea."
01:24:58;01:25:00;"Oh, okay. Oh, I see."
01:25:00;01:25:07;"Jake asked you what year his first solo album was. Why? Because he was in a band before? He was in like a Buffalo Springfield situation?"
01:25:07;01:25:10;"No, he's always just been Bobby Byrd."
01:25:10;01:25:11;"Oh, he's always just been solo."
01:25:11;01:25:15;"But that tracks to me. His first album was 1968."
01:25:15;01:25:16;"Yeah."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"I like that."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"Definitely."
01:25:18;01:25:26;"The number five song this week in 1968, the year of Bobby Byrd's first album, is Johnny Nash with ""Hold Me Tight."""
01:25:30;01:25:34;"Whoa, you know, Johnny Nash is the most famous for ""I Can See Clearly Now."""
01:25:34;01:25:35;"Oh, yeah."
01:25:35;01:25:38;"I didn't know he had any other hits."
01:25:47;01:25:52;"You know what an interesting thing about Johnny Nash? Not Jamaican. He's from Texas."
01:25:52;01:26:03;"Right. I was going to say, how is it that this guy had these kind of reggae inflected hits, but there weren't other reggae hits in the late 60s, were there?"
01:26:03;01:26:06;"The dude just dug deep in the bins, you know?"
01:26:06;01:26:08;"He was a guy from Texas."
01:26:08;01:26:10;"I guess he moved to Jamaica at some point."
01:26:10;01:26:11;"Really?"
01:26:11;01:26:14;"He was already like an adult professional singer."
01:26:21;01:26:23;"It's a pleasant little song."
01:26:23;01:26:26;"Oh, yeah. Very tasteful. Beautiful voice."
01:26:26;01:26:34;"But he is such an outlier on the charts of the late 60s. I would have thought there'd be more music like this."
01:26:34;01:26:41;"I mean, it's a good question. Definitely in England, there was reggae all up in the charts in 1968."
01:26:41;01:26:49;"I think Desmond Decker, who he kind of sounds like, charted in the US. I'm going to throw in ""Israelites"" by Desmond Decker."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"What year is that?"
01:26:51;01:26:54;"I think that's '69. I know it's '68 as well."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"I'm getting a beer."
01:26:59;01:27:01;"Yeah, by all means."
01:27:01;01:27:04;"Yeah, so, same year."
01:27:04;01:27:05;"This song rules."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"Yeah, beautiful."
01:27:09;01:27:16;"All right, so this is a global hit, actually. This is number one in the UK, but it cracked the top 10 in the US."
01:27:29;01:27:33;"How come they never use this in American movies about the 60s?"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"In my neighborhood."
01:27:37;01:27:39;"Is that the VO?"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"Yeah, we're doing..."
01:27:41;01:27:51;"1968, Brooklyn, ""Israelites"" playing. Or I'm also just picturing like young Steven Spielberg, what was his movie? ""Meet the Fablemans""?"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Yeah."
01:27:52;01:27:54;"Did you guys see that one?"
01:27:54;01:27:55;"No."
01:27:55;01:27:56;"Yeah, that was pretty good, actually."
01:27:56;01:28:00;"I refuse to engage with that title. Too corny for me."
01:28:00;01:28:03;"I thought the movie was going to be cornier because of stuff like that."
01:28:03;01:28:04;"Mm-hmm."
01:28:04;01:28:10;"But you might appreciate the depiction of 1950s, 1960s Phoenix."
01:28:10;01:28:11;"That sounds interesting."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"Yeah, I should watch it just for that."
01:28:16;01:28:19;"Is this like playing on the radio in Texas?"
01:28:19;01:28:27;"I bet so, man. It'd be like ""Hey Jude"" by the Beatles into this, into a Marvin Gaye, Tammy Turrell song."
01:28:29;01:28:32;"Let's check out the number five song in our world."
01:28:32;01:28:39;"2023, the number five song is ""Doja Cat"" with ""Paint the Town Red."" You Doja Cat fan, Carson?"
01:28:39;01:28:50;"It's a complicated question because she's on my jogging mix, which I go hard into top five songs I would never listen to in the rest of my life."
01:28:50;01:28:54;"But I've jogged many miles to this song."
01:28:54;01:28:55;"To this song, you know it."
01:28:55;01:28:57;"I probably know it by heart."
01:28:57;01:29:01;"With a sample from the 1960s, ""Walk on By"" by Dionne Warwick."
01:29:05;01:29:09;"Wait, so Carson, you don't make the playlist?"
01:29:09;01:29:16;"No, I make it, but I put on all kinds of stuff like this. I actually shared it with you, remember?"
01:29:16;01:29:19;"Oh, right. I don't think I really checked it out."
01:29:19;01:29:22;"You can't jog to Graham Parsons?"
01:29:22;01:29:23;"No."
01:29:23;01:29:24;"Really?"
01:29:24;01:29:27;"That's relaxing music for me."
01:29:27;01:29:38;"But here's what I'm asking. Do you know what the song sounds like when you put it on the mix, or are you just throwing songs on randomly you've never heard that are current
hits and you learn the songs as you're running?"
01:29:38;01:29:47;"I think I heard this, and then I put it on. It felt like the right vibe for my jogging mix. There's a lot of techno, too."
01:29:47;01:29:48;"Wow."
01:29:55;01:29:57;"What else you got on there?"
01:29:57;01:30:01;"Let me see. I'll just open it up and let you know."
01:30:01;01:30:04;"This song is dope."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"Definitely one of the best pop."
01:30:06;01:30:08;"This was on a month or two ago."
01:30:08;01:30:11;"Yeah, this is definitely one of the best singles of the year."
01:30:11;01:30:16;"I got really hardcore German rap on my jogging mix."
01:30:16;01:30:18;"Okay."
01:30:18;01:30:20;"By Casper Kontra K."
01:30:20;01:30:22;"""Erflag ist kein Glück."""
01:30:22;01:30:23;"Whoa."
01:30:23;01:30:43;"It's really funny. The German rappers are really buff dudes. I read a translation of the lyrics, and they're all like, ""You can do it. You can get to the top of the
mountain."" It's really funny that I could tell what it was about."
01:30:43;01:30:45;"Inspirational?"
01:30:45;01:30:48;"Yeah, they're all about working out, basically, these songs."
01:30:48;01:30:50;"Oh, nice. That's what you want to listen to."
01:30:50;01:31:02;"Also, they're 25 years behind, so everything's super influenced by '90s rap. That's cool, too, if you're an old man like me."
01:31:02;01:31:04;"I feel you."
01:31:04;01:31:07;"It feels really familiar, but new."

01:35:39;01:35:41;"That's the one he's talking to his dad?"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"Yeah, it's so good."
01:35:43;01:35:49;"He's just like, ""Sorry I wasn't home for Mom's wedding or Mom's funeral."""
01:35:49;01:35:51;"He's just like this [expletive]."
01:35:51;01:35:52;"""We got a gig. We got a gig."""
01:35:52;01:35:57;"And then his new wife, who's like the keyboard player in the band,"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"is like sitting in the car."
01:35:59;01:36:03;"And he's wearing a bunch of flare that he's embarrassed about,"
01:36:03;01:36:06;"and he has to explain it to his dad."
01:36:06;01:36:10;"All right, let's move on to the number three song this week in 1968,"
01:36:10;01:36:14;"Diana Ross and the Supremes' ""Love Child."""
01:36:16;01:36:17;"Great song."
01:36:23;01:36:25;"Another story song."
01:36:26;01:36:27;"Yeah."
01:36:29;01:36:33;"I was really--this reminds me a little of Minnie Riperton."
01:36:33;01:36:36;"I was really late to discovering her."
01:36:36;01:36:38;"Oh, yeah, amazing voice."
01:36:44;01:36:47;"It sounds like the Supremes are trying to find something"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"that wasn't just another love song."
01:36:49;01:36:50;"Yeah."
01:36:50;01:36:52;"Trying to be a little edgy."
01:36:56;01:37:00;"I definitely remember listening to oldies radio as a kid and being like,"
01:37:00;01:37:02;"""Whoa, this is a different look for the Supremes,"""
01:37:02;01:37:05;"even when I was like 14."
01:37:05;01:37:09;"Totally familiar with ""Baby Love"" and ""Stopping the Name of Love,"""
01:37:09;01:37:13;"and all the classics from the mid-'60s."
01:37:13;01:37:16;"And then they had ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" also,"
01:37:16;01:37:20;"which we heard a few months ago, which was a different sound."
01:37:20;01:37:25;"But this was like--specifically, I was like--this line is hardcore."
01:37:25;01:37:29;"""We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating."""
01:37:41;01:37:46;"In a way, are they saying that they need to let that [bleep] breathe?"
01:37:46;01:37:48;"Excuse me, Seinfeld?"
01:37:48;01:37:51;"I'm just referencing the last song."
01:37:51;01:37:53;"Oh, is that what Drake's--that's what she was saying?"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"Oh, Sexy Red, ""Let That [bleep] Breathe."""
01:37:55;01:37:56;"That's what Sexy Red was saying."
01:37:56;01:37:57;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:37:57;01:38:01;"You know, Ezra, I can't believe you missed that line."
01:38:01;01:38:03;"I was in ""Dumpty Hallworld."""
01:38:03;01:38:05;"Yeah, I didn't hear any of that song."
01:38:05;01:38:08;"Yeah, I kind of just spaced out thinking about country music."
01:38:11;01:38:14;"[singing]"
01:38:30;01:38:33;"Hey, guys, can I say something else about Seeger real quick?"
01:38:33;01:38:34;"Yeah, Bob Seeger?"
01:38:34;01:38:35;"Bob Seeger."
01:38:35;01:38:40;"So the reason I don't like Seeger is kind of--it's funny because I can trace it"
01:38:40;01:38:45;"all the way back to being 14 and peer pressure because my dad's friend who"
01:38:45;01:38:50;"introduced me to Bowie and Big Star and Nick Lowe and I could just--he would"
01:38:50;01:38:54;"send me to Best Buy and just pick out five great albums for me every time."
01:38:54;01:39:00;"I had Seeger once, and he picked up the CD and he went, ""Ooh, Seeger, bad,"""
01:39:00;01:39:04;"and he threw it on my desk with disdain."
01:39:04;01:39:08;"And that's the only reason I don't like Bob Seeger."
01:39:08;01:39:14;"It's not even my taste or my choice, which is kind of sad."
01:39:14;01:39:15;"Wow."
01:39:15;01:39:18;"I mean, it's funny because he has a mixed bag."
01:39:18;01:39:21;"Like, old-time rock and roll--"
01:39:21;01:39:22;"Pretty rough."
01:39:22;01:39:26;"Not a particularly cool song, although it goes off live."
01:39:26;01:39:27;"Let me tell you."
01:39:27;01:39:28;"That's true."
01:39:28;01:39:31;"At the Forum, we blew the roof off the place."
01:39:31;01:39:34;"I mean, and like Jake said, beautiful ballads."
01:39:34;01:39:37;"I'm very partial to ""We've Got Tonight,"" but Carson,"
01:39:37;01:39:39;"how familiar are you with ""Still the Same""?"
01:39:39;01:39:40;"Oh, yeah."
01:39:40;01:39:42;"I do remember ""Dance."""
01:39:42;01:39:43;"Oh, no."
01:39:43;01:39:44;"""Throw on Still the Same."""
01:39:44;01:39:46;"Yeah, beautiful song."
01:39:46;01:39:50;"Yeah, actually, Bob's the master of the mid-tempo ballad."
01:39:50;01:39:51;"It's not--"
01:39:51;01:39:52;"You know what?"
01:39:52;01:39:53;"I like this song."
01:39:53;01:39:54;"You know it, right?"
01:39:54;01:39:55;"Yeah."
01:39:55;01:39:58;"As soon as you hear the opening chords, it kind of sends a chill up your spine."
01:39:58;01:39:59;"Yeah."
01:39:59;01:40:00;"Beautiful."
01:40:00;01:40:01;"Yeah."
01:40:01;01:40:03;"Jim Cherry steered me wrong on this one."
01:40:03;01:40:10;"[MUSIC - JIM CHERRY, ""STILL THE SAME""]"
01:40:10;01:40:11;"I mean, come on."
01:40:11;01:40:13;"Talk about a toe-tapper."
01:40:13;01:40:15;"I'm literally tapping my toe over here."
01:40:15;01:40:16;"As am I, dude."
01:40:16;01:40:17;"Didn't even realize I was."
01:40:17;01:40:18;"You're totally right."
01:40:18;01:40:23;"[MUSIC - JIM CHERRY, ""STILL THE SAME""]"
01:40:23;01:40:27;"And just great song craft, like the way the chords change here."
01:40:27;01:40:32;"Yeah, he doesn't get props as a guy that wrote beautiful, powerful melodies."
01:40:32;01:40:40;"[MUSIC - JIM CHERRY, ""STILL THE SAME""]"
01:40:40;01:40:45;"The problem, too, was the album I bought was his greatest hits."
01:40:45;01:40:50;"And he looked so corny on the cover at an age where that kind of thing"
01:40:50;01:40:52;"mattered to me."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"No, I know what you mean, man."
01:40:54;01:41:00;"It took me-- when I was a teenager, I definitely was not now a Bob Seger."
01:41:00;01:41:05;"And especially that era when ""Like a Rock"" was on all of those--"
01:41:05;01:41:06;"Oh, yeah."
01:41:06;01:41:07;"--car ads."
01:41:08;01:41:09;"Yeah."
01:41:09;01:41:12;"Yeah, and I was like, this guy sucks."
01:41:12;01:41:16;"Yeah, he didn't do himself any favors with that bull [BLEEP]"
01:41:16;01:41:21;"And my association with him was ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" and ""Like a Rock,"""
01:41:21;01:41:25;"which is admittedly later period-- it's '80s Seger."
01:41:25;01:41:27;"And then it was only after really listening to ""Against the Wind"""
01:41:27;01:41:30;"or something where I was like, oh, this is--"
01:41:30;01:41:33;"Yeah, and I could also see-- if you picture the ""Against the Wind"" album"
01:41:33;01:41:35;"cover, it's light blue--"
01:41:35;01:41:36;"Terrible."
01:41:36;01:41:39;"--with these horses running, and you see the reflection on it."
01:41:39;01:41:45;"In the '90s, probably for a lot of people, that connoted being in somebody's"
01:41:45;01:41:48;"weird basement that smelled like cigarettes."
01:41:48;01:41:52;"Just kind of like-- something that would associate a depressing image"
01:41:52;01:41:55;"for a kid who grew up in the '80s or '90s."
01:41:55;01:41:59;"I don't know, like if your dad took you to a bar or something,"
01:41:59;01:42:00;"just like that imagery."
01:42:00;01:42:05;"Whereas by the 2000s, you can look at that cover with the horses running on it"
01:42:05;01:42:09;"as being kind of an amazing piece of American kitsch."
01:42:09;01:42:12;"And maybe not even that-- maybe transcends kitsch."
01:42:12;01:42:17;"Just like-- imagine to unironically just make an American rock album"
01:42:17;01:42:24;"and just have five white stallions running across some puddles,"
01:42:24;01:42:28;"and it's like thrift store art, but completely unironic."
01:42:28;01:42:29;"[MUSIC - DRAKE, ""STILL THE SAME""]"
01:42:29;01:42:32;"(SINGING) Still the same."
01:42:32;01:42:34;"Ooh, the game begins."
01:42:34;01:42:36;"Still the same."
01:42:36;01:42:37;"Baby, baby, still the same."
01:42:37;01:42:38;"Want to hear another Drake song?"
01:42:38;01:42:39;"Yes, do it."
01:42:39;01:42:41;"Oh, he got another hit?"
01:42:41;01:42:44;"I think Drake's dominating the top five."
01:42:44;01:42:45;"Does he have a new album or something?"
01:42:45;01:42:49;"Yeah, he had a new album last month, and this song is called ""IDGF."""
01:42:49;01:42:51;"Anybody know what that stands for?"
01:42:51;01:42:52;"I don't give a--"
01:42:52;01:42:54;"Thank God it's Friday."
01:42:54;01:42:55;"Oh, no."
01:42:55;01:42:58;"I don't give a--"
01:42:58;01:42:59;"I don't give a Friday?"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"I don't give a Friday."
01:43:01;01:43:05;"I demand, God, allow Fridays."
01:43:05;01:43:07;"I don't girlfriend."
01:43:07;01:43:09;"I demand good fried eggs."
01:43:09;01:43:12;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:43:12;01:43:15;"That's true of me, but I'll do it politely, you know?"
01:43:15;01:43:17;"I don't got friends."
01:43:17;01:43:20;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:43:20;01:43:22;"I don't got a friend."
01:43:22;01:43:24;"I don't got any friends."
01:43:24;01:43:27;"It does sound like kind of a sad song."
01:43:27;01:43:29;"Maybe it is about I don't got a friend."
01:43:29;01:43:34;"I mean, the real big celebs don't have friends."
01:43:34;01:43:35;"It's true."
01:43:35;01:43:41;"Drake famously said no new friends a while back, but then if you followed his career,"
01:43:41;01:43:47;"you'd get the impression that he's been betrayed many times by fake friends and clout chasers."
01:43:47;01:43:52;"So between the no new friends and the sharp drop off, he probably has no friends."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"That's how you end up with the song, ""I Don't Got a Friend."""
01:43:54;01:43:55;"Yeah."
01:43:55;01:43:59;"And this is featuring Yeet."
01:43:59;01:44:02;"Seinfeld, you want to tell us about Yeet?"
01:44:02;01:44:03;"Yeet?"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"Who's Yeet?"
01:44:04;01:44:05;"Yeet."
01:44:05;01:44:07;"Oh, man."
01:44:07;01:44:10;"So I must be really losing touch."
01:44:10;01:44:11;"Yeah, Yeet."
01:44:11;01:44:14;"I'm learning about Yeet right now in real time."

01:44:17;01:44:20;"I don't got a friend."
01:44:20;01:44:22;"I can tell you about Yeet."
01:44:22;01:44:26;"Seinfeld, can you just read the Wikipedia page for Yeet?"
01:44:26;01:44:27;"I'm on it."
01:44:27;01:44:30;"Born Noah Oliver Smith."
01:44:30;01:44:34;"He's an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer."
01:44:34;01:44:38;"Known for his experimental sound and unconventional fashion."
01:44:38;01:44:39;"Thank you, Seinfeld."
01:44:39;01:44:44;"Coming live from the one out of five."
01:44:44;01:44:45;"Coming live from the three, two, time."
01:44:45;01:44:47;"Whole gang, they eastbound and they down just like Danny McBride."
01:44:47;01:44:49;"Why I always see your dogs in the city?"
01:44:49;01:44:51;"Think you boys left some soldier behind?"
01:44:51;01:44:53;"Just like the J, you boys try to buy."
01:44:53;01:44:54;"Okay."
01:44:54;01:44:56;"In a totally different direction."
01:44:56;01:45:00;"1968, the number two song."
01:45:00;01:45:02;"I actually, I always love this song."
01:45:02;01:45:04;"I don't know if we've ever heard it on TC before."

01:45:11;01:45:13;"Oh, yeah."
01:45:13;01:45:14;"Oh, yeah."
01:45:14;01:45:18;"It's a rewrite of a Russian folk song."
01:45:18;01:45:24;"How the hell did Paul McCartney have time in 1968 to produce a Mary Hopkins record?"
01:45:24;01:45:27;"Three hours at the studio."
01:45:27;01:45:29;"That's what Lennon said."
01:45:29;01:45:31;"Yeah."
01:45:31;01:45:33;"Come on, Paul."
01:45:33;01:45:36;"John was like, ""Paul, I have time."""
01:45:36;01:45:38;"I wish I could do a better John."
01:45:38;01:45:40;"Focus, Paul. Focus."
01:45:40;01:45:44;"Hey, did you guys listen to that new Beatles song, speaking of John and Paul?"
01:45:44;01:45:47;"They should have left that one in the archives."
01:45:47;01:45:49;"Yeah."
01:45:49;01:45:53;"It's like tainting my like a bird, you know?"
01:45:53;01:45:55;"I mean, it's not a Beatles song."
01:45:55;01:45:58;"There's a reason it didn't see the light of day."
01:45:58;01:46:01;"We'd live the life we choose."
01:46:01;01:46:04;"We'd fight and never lose."
01:46:04;01:46:10;"For we were young and sure to have our way."
01:46:10;01:46:12;"Pa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la."
01:46:12;01:46:15;"It's a touch corny, but it is a cool Russian melody."
01:46:15;01:46:16;"No, I like this."
01:46:16;01:46:19;"Just think about this. This is 1968."
01:46:19;01:46:22;"To me, this is like Tinker Tail or Soldier Spy."
01:46:22;01:46:28;"Just like height of the Cold War and up on the charts in America and the UK."
01:46:28;01:46:31;"It's just like pretend Russian song."
01:46:31;01:46:32;"You know what I mean?"
01:46:32;01:46:38;"I'm just like George Smiley in control, just like getting in a taxi."
01:46:38;01:46:40;"And this is like playing on the radio."
01:46:40;01:46:43;"It gives me like eerie Cold War vibes."
01:46:43;01:46:46;"I feel like I'm getting Dresden Dolls PTSD."
01:46:46;01:46:48;"Yes, I know what you mean."
01:46:48;01:46:51;"Not quite as cool 40 years later."
01:46:51;01:46:57;"For the days, my friend, we thought they'd never end."
01:46:57;01:46:59;"Also, okay, how about this?"
01:46:59;01:47:02;"Because, yeah, of course, this is cheesy."
01:47:02;01:47:05;"But imagine this."
01:47:05;01:47:09;"English CIA is MI6 or is it MI5?"
01:47:09;01:47:12;"One of them. I think it's MI5."
01:47:12;01:47:14;"Jake, you should know this."
01:47:14;01:47:18;"MI6 is the FBI. I think MI5 is the CIA."
01:47:18;01:47:19;"Also, just picture this."
01:47:19;01:47:22;"You're standing in front of a brutalist apartment building."
01:47:22;01:47:30;"You're an Oxford-educated MI6 agent who's selling secrets to the Soviets."
01:47:30;01:47:35;"And this is just like blasting out of a shop."
01:47:35;01:47:38;"And then it's like a slow zoom on you."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"A man between two worlds."
01:47:40;01:47:43;"Deep in your heart, you want to take down England."
01:47:43;01:47:48;"But you also feel bad about betraying all your friends in MI5."
01:47:48;01:47:52;"And Mary Hopkins tearing up the charts with ""Those Were the Days."""
01:47:52;01:47:54;"Wow, that's good. I like that."
01:47:54;01:48:00;"I mean, I wonder if anyone at MI5 was legit like, ""Is this a Russian op?"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"How is this on?"""
01:48:02;01:48:04;"How did they get to Paul McCartney?"

01:48:14;01:48:18;"You know, all the Beatles are spies, right?"
01:48:18;01:48:22;"Yeah, they had to open up files on all the Beatles."
01:48:22;01:48:26;"I'm sure you guys have discussed so much rock history here,"
01:48:26;01:48:30;"but I heard they wrote that ""We Don't Want a Revolution"" song"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"so they wouldn't get deported."
01:48:32;01:48:34;"Oh, just to turn down the heat a bit?"
01:48:34;01:48:38;"Yeah, they were like, ""We don't want a revolution. Don't deport us."""
01:48:38;01:48:41;"Wait, from America or from where?"
01:48:41;01:48:46;"From America. They thought they were going to get deported for being too, you know--"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"Like they wouldn't be allowed back in the country?"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"Jim Cherry could tell us."
01:48:50;01:48:56;"As much as he hates Seger, he knows more rock history than any man I've ever met."
01:48:56;01:49:02;"I also thought ""Revolution"" was like John Lennon's kind of snarky, snide response"
01:49:02;01:49:06;"to like fake politics of like the hippie movement."
01:49:06;01:49:09;"Yeah, I think he was distancing himself from it."
01:49:09;01:49:11;"But like, I don't know."
01:49:11;01:49:14;"♪ For in our hearts the dreams are still the same ♪"
01:49:14;01:49:17;"I like this song. I like this vibe."
01:49:17;01:49:20;"It reminds me of the McGarrigle sisters, too."
01:49:20;01:49:25;"I'm digging my heels in. I'm anti this song. Sorry, guys."
01:49:25;01:49:30;"Am I wrong that the tempo shifts? Like this song gets--"
01:49:30;01:49:35;"I think it's got a little speed up, like that classic East Block speed up."
01:49:35;01:49:38;"A little bit of Tetris. A little bit of Tetris energy."
01:49:38;01:49:40;"A little Tetris."
01:49:40;01:49:46;"We're on the number two song right now in our current universe."
01:49:46;01:49:47;"Yep."
01:49:47;01:49:51;"2023. Jungkook and Lotto with ""7."""
01:49:51;01:49:54;"♪"
01:49:54;01:49:58;"Now, Jake, of course, you know Jungkook. You're a fan."
01:49:58;01:50:00;"Is he from BTS?"
01:50:00;01:50:01;"That's right."
01:50:01;01:50:03;"♪ Weight of the world on your shoulders ♪"
01:50:03;01:50:07;"♪ I'll kiss your waist and leave your mind ♪"
01:50:07;01:50:10;"♪ I must be favored to know, yeah ♪"
01:50:10;01:50:14;"This is kind of like some throwback UK vibes."
01:50:14;01:50:17;"It's like a Craig David. It's like a Craig David."
01:50:17;01:50:20;"Is this about the David Fincher film?"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"[laughter]"
01:50:22;01:50:27;"I ate in the same Italian restaurant as BTS a few months ago."
01:50:27;01:50:30;"Wait, say that again, Carson?"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"I'm going to do a little name dropping here."
01:50:32;01:50:35;"I went to have dinner with my friend Mike Judge."
01:50:35;01:50:36;"Nice."
01:50:36;01:50:42;"I was very excited when I got there because BTS was filming a reality show"
01:50:42;01:50:44;"in like two booths over."
01:50:44;01:50:45;"Whoa."
01:50:45;01:50:48;"So are you and Mike Judge in the background?"
01:50:48;01:50:50;"Yeah, probably."
01:50:50;01:50:53;"Wait, Carson, you're talking about the K-pop group?"
01:50:53;01:50:54;"Yeah, yeah."
01:50:54;01:50:57;"Not Build This Film. Okay, we just have to check."
01:50:57;01:51:00;"Is Mike, is he a BTS fan?"
01:51:00;01:51:04;"No, he knew about them way more than me from making new Beavis and Butt-Heads,"
01:51:04;01:51:06;"but he was kind of starstruck."
01:51:06;01:51:07;"It was really funny."
01:51:07;01:51:10;"I'd never seen him like – he was like really excited and kind of nervous."
01:51:10;01:51:13;"He's like, ""Holy s***, Carson, that's BTS."""
01:51:13;01:51:15;"I was like, ""Carson?"""
01:51:15;01:51:20;"[laughter]"
01:51:20;01:51:23;"I got to check out those new Beavis and Butt-Head episodes."
01:51:23;01:51:26;"I would love to hear Butt-Head be like, ""Ugh,"""
01:51:26;01:51:30;"and just kind of riff, pontificate on BTS."
01:51:30;01:51:34;"Oh, man, the new movie, the newest movie was really good."
01:51:34;01:51:35;"Oh, it was really good."
01:51:35;01:51:36;"Yeah, yeah."
01:51:36;01:51:37;"Do the Universe?"
01:51:37;01:51:39;"Yeah, that was really good."
01:51:39;01:51:41;"I loved that."
01:51:41;01:51:42;"I got to watch it."
01:51:49;01:51:52;"All right, that's a fun song."
01:51:52;01:51:55;"So, unfortunately, The 7 is for 7 days a week."
01:51:55;01:51:58;"It's not for The 7 Deadly Sins."
01:51:58;01:52:01;"That would have been very provocative and bold."
01:52:01;01:52:06;"The number one song this week in 1968 is The Beatles with ""Hey Jude."""
01:52:11;01:52:12;"Paul was busy."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"What can you say about ""Hey Jude?"""
01:52:15;01:52:16;"It's a good song."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"It's a long song."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"People sometimes forget it's a long song."
01:52:20;01:52:24;"I think it's been, I don't know, seven minutes?"
01:52:27;01:52:33;"It's been many years, but I feel like we've heard this song on this show at least five times."
01:52:33;01:52:35;"Yes, we often catch this."
01:52:35;01:52:40;"I feel like we did a lot of top fives in 1968, like five years ago."
01:52:45;01:52:46;"This is interesting."
01:52:46;01:52:56;"I mean, everybody knows about that supposedly this is Paul saying something to John Lennon's son when his parents were getting divorced."
01:52:56;01:52:57;"""Hey Jules."""
01:52:57;01:53:00;"Yes, ""Hey Jules,"" and he changed it to ""Jude."""
01:53:00;01:53:05;"I guess Julian actually spoke on it on Bill Maher's Club Random podcast."
01:53:05;01:53:07;"This is what he had to say."
01:53:07;01:53:10;"""I have a love-hate relationship with it, I have to say."
01:53:10;01:53:18;"The fact that Dad walked out, walked away, left Mom and I, that was a point of complete change and complete disruption and complete darkness and sadness."
01:53:18;01:53:25;"I mean, I was only three, but I recognized that something was up, but for Mom it was heartbreaking."
01:53:25;01:53:29;"It's a reminder of that time and that place, so I get both sides of it."
01:53:29;01:53:34;"But a lot of people don't necessarily understand there's a dark yin and yang of that song."""
01:53:34;01:53:36;"I feel it."
01:53:36;01:53:39;"Yes, I guess that is pretty harsh."
01:53:39;01:53:46;"He's three, still perceiving something's off and not seeing his dad as much."
01:53:46;01:53:57;"Imagine Cynthia, the mom, just this monster hit that's this kind of sad, cheer-up song for her son, whose dad left."
01:53:57;01:54:02;"Did Paul and John have a Ray Davies-Dave Davies relationship where he would be like,"
01:54:02;01:54:09;"Paul would come in and be like, ""I wrote this song about how you're a s*** dad,"" or did he hit it from him?"
01:54:09;01:54:13;"I've read John interviews where John interpreted it positively."
01:54:13;01:54:17;"There's even one where he said, in an interview in the '70s, where he said,"
01:54:17;01:54:23;"""Yeah, you know, Paul wrote this thing, and it's kind of about my son, but I think it was also to me."
01:54:23;01:54:27;"You know, 'Hey, John, a little bit of 'Keep Your Head Up' to me.'"""
01:54:27;01:54:35;"So, obviously, they famously had some beef, but everything I've ever read in terms of John,"
01:54:35;01:54:39;"he kind of was like, ""Yeah, good song, and yeah, good looking out."""
01:54:39;01:54:42;"Maybe he's off about the fact that it had anything to do with him."
01:54:42;01:54:45;"I have kind of an epic ""Hey Jude"" story."
01:54:45;01:54:46;"Oh, yeah?"
01:54:46;01:54:54;"Yeah, when I was 15, my dad and his good friend, Bob Bozbell, who's an Old West historian,"
01:54:54;01:55:01;"and his son, Tommy, and I, we went on a trip to Chihuahua and Copper Canyon in Mexico."
01:55:01;01:55:09;"And from Chihuahua, you would take this old, janky, clankin' train that you could stand in between the cars"
01:55:09;01:55:12;"and go out on the cattle catcher if you wanted to."
01:55:12;01:55:22;"And one day, we had this really cool guide named Jorge, who was the one who would get us everywhere safely."
01:55:22;01:55:31;"And one day, when we're on this train, we're talking to Jorge about what kind of music he likes."
01:55:31;01:55:33;"He's like, ""Oh, I love The Beatles."""
01:55:33;01:55:35;"And he starts singing ""Hey Jude."""
01:55:35;01:55:39;"Me and my friend, we start singing along."
01:55:39;01:55:45;"And then my friend's dad, Bob Bozbell, he was a radio personality in Phoenix, so yeah, really big personality."
01:55:45;01:55:46;"Amazing."
01:55:46;01:55:52;"And we hit this section, you know, this part, basically."
01:55:52;01:55:58;"And his dad jumps up into the aisle and starts going, ""Na-na-na-na, hey Jude."""
01:55:58;01:56:02;"And then slowly, the entire train joins in."
01:56:02;01:56:08;"And there was all Mexican people, like Mexican laborers, but they all knew the song and they all loved it."
01:56:08;01:56:09;"Everybody knew ""Hey Jude,"" bro."
01:56:09;01:56:18;"The whole train was shaking with ""Hey Jude"" for like five minutes, like as long as Paul goes on here, is how long Bob sung it."
01:56:18;01:56:27;"And then the coolest part of it all was as soon as it ended, everyone just sat back down and no one said a thing about it."
01:56:27;01:56:32;"It was just like we're possessed by Beatle love collectively."
01:56:32;01:56:34;"Just on a train to rural Mexico?"
01:56:34;01:56:35;"Yeah."
01:56:35;01:56:36;"Amazing."
01:56:36;01:56:37;"It was so cool."
01:56:37;01:56:38;"Beautiful."
01:56:38;01:56:43;"I was like, the power of The Beatles can't be understated."
01:56:43;01:56:45;"What year do you think that was?"
01:56:45;01:56:48;"It was 1995."
01:56:48;01:56:51;"27 years after this was at number one."
01:56:51;01:56:52;"Yeah."
01:56:52;01:56:55;"Now let's check out the number one song in our time."
01:56:55;01:57:01;"It's Taylor Swift, debatably The Beatles of 2023."
01:57:01;01:57:03;"The one person Beatles."
01:57:03;01:57:08;"With ""Is It Over Now,"" Taylor's version from 1989, Taylor's version."
01:57:08;01:57:12;"So she re-recorded 1989?"
01:57:12;01:57:13;"I don't know, Seinfeld."
01:57:13;01:57:14;"Let's get a number."
01:57:14;01:57:19;"This is the song that was on the original 1989 and it's re-recorded now?"
01:57:19;01:57:21;"Yeah, sorry."
01:57:21;01:57:22;"What is the track?"
01:57:22;01:57:24;"""Is It Over Now?"""
01:57:24;01:57:26;"Okay."
01:57:26;01:57:29;"Released October 27, 2023."
01:57:29;01:57:36;"With a title like that, you could slip into an Abbott and Costello routine accidentally if you're not careful."
01:57:36;01:57:38;"Is what over now?"
01:57:38;01:57:41;"It's a vault track."
01:57:41;01:57:47;"So it was written during the original release in 2014, but it didn't come out until now."
01:57:47;01:57:48;"Oh, I see."
01:57:48;01:57:50;"So it's one of those highly prized--"
01:57:50;01:57:51;"It didn't make the cut."
01:57:51;01:57:52;"Did not make the cut."
01:57:52;01:57:54;"So this is a B-side?"
01:57:54;01:57:56;"It's an unreleased--"
01:57:56;01:57:57;"Oh, it's unreleased."
01:57:57;01:57:58;"Yeah, yeah."
01:57:58;01:57:59;"It was in the vault."
01:58:00;01:58:05;"Wow, that is the power of Taylor in 2023, a B-side."
01:58:05;01:58:07;"No, no, no, Jake, not a B-- a lost tape."
01:58:07;01:58:09;"No, Jake, it's not unreleased."
01:58:09;01:58:11;"Okay, my bad, my bad, my bad."
01:58:11;01:58:14;"We're really splitting hairs here in the terminology."
01:58:14;01:58:16;"An unreleased track from 10 years ago or whatever."
01:58:16;01:58:17;"Yeah, from the vault."
01:58:17;01:58:19;"From the vault."
01:58:24;01:58:30;"You know how Castle, that world-famous band, it's an abbreviation of Carson Mow?"
01:58:30;01:58:31;"Yeah."
01:58:31;01:58:36;"Do you think BTS is-- they consciously tried to do the Beatles?"
01:58:36;01:58:38;"Oh, wow."
01:58:38;01:58:39;"So we--"
01:58:39;01:58:42;"Oh, I thought you were going to say the TS is for Taylor Swift."
01:58:42;01:58:44;"It's actually boy band Taylor Swift."
01:58:44;01:58:46;"The B is for boy band."
01:58:46;01:58:48;"Boy band."
01:58:48;01:58:53;"Beatles, BTS, Beatles, you know?"
01:58:53;01:58:55;"I mean, it connotes all those things."
01:58:55;01:58:58;"It's got the Beatles, it's got Taylor Swift, it's got all the biggest things in the world."
01:58:58;01:59:02;"All right, it's got Built to Spill, biggest indie rock band out of Idaho."
01:59:02;01:59:03;"It's got everything."
01:59:03;01:59:05;"It definitely is not--"
01:59:05;01:59:09;"Dude, if it was a Built to Spill record, that would blow my mind."
01:59:09;01:59:15;"That's a long-running joke on the show is Jake pretending that BTS is Built to Spill."
01:59:15;01:59:21;"Yeah, Doug took a real turn in his production style about 10 years ago."
01:59:21;01:59:26;"I mean, he did-- his whole goal with that band was to change it up every album."
01:59:26;01:59:32;"But they've gotten to a very deep rut, I would say, since '98."
01:59:32;01:59:34;"Yeah, I mean, there's always so many--"
01:59:34;01:59:35;"Well, not a rut."
01:59:35;01:59:37;"Yeah, I like the new BTS."
01:59:37;01:59:43;"I just-- yeah, at a certain point, if you're an artist, you only have so many moves."
01:59:43;01:59:48;"But if you look at those first three or four albums, each one did have a really distinct sound."
01:59:48;01:59:50;"Agreed."
01:59:50;01:59:55;"Up until Perfect From Now On, and now it's all in that kind of world, right?"
01:59:55;01:59:58;"I would say it's all in the keep it a secret kind of world."
01:59:58;02:00:00;"Oh, interesting."
02:00:00;02:00:06;"Because we've talked so much about Built to Spill on this show because of the popularity of the Korean group BTS."
02:00:06;02:00:11;"Jake, why don't we go out-- or Carson, maybe, because you're a special guest."
02:00:11;02:00:15;"Why don't we go out, Carson, on your favorite Built to Spill song?"
02:00:15;02:00:19;"Because we might have some listeners who've been hearing us talk about this band for eight years,"
02:00:19;02:00:22;"and they don't know what they sound like."
02:00:22;02:00:28;"All they know is that they share the initials of the Korean monster boy band."
02:00:28;02:00:30;"What's your favorite Built to Spill song?"
02:00:30;02:00:34;"I mean, I was obsessed with them, so I'm just going to pick a favorite."
02:00:34;02:00:36;"Which album are you going to go off?"
02:00:36;02:00:42;"I think I'll probably go off of Perfect From Now On just because we're talking about it."
02:00:42;02:00:46;"""Kick That in the Sun"" might be my favorite off of that."
02:00:46;02:00:49;"All right. Well, thank you very much to Carson Mel."
02:00:49;02:00:52;"Check out the new book, Cherry on Top."
02:00:52;02:00:54;"It's available at Secret Headquarters."
02:00:54;02:00:56;"Oh, yeah. Where do you get it?"
02:00:56;02:01:01;"Just Google ""Secret Headquarters Cherry on Top"" or my name, and it'll pop up."
02:01:01;02:01:04;"But it's through the Secret Headquarters website."
02:01:04;02:01:07;"All right. Here's some Built to Spill. We'll see you guys in two weeks."
02:01:07;02:01:09;"See you later. Thanks."
02:01:10;02:01:16;"Backwashed thoughts"
02:01:16;02:01:19;"And you make me talk"
02:01:19;02:01:23;"No, you make me listen"
02:01:23;02:01:29;"There's a feeling"
02:01:29;02:01:33;"From A to 2 I read"
02:01:33;02:01:37;"There's something, there's nothing"
02:01:37;02:01:40;"You haven't seen"
02:01:40;02:01:43;"Tiny TV"

02:01:52;02:01:54;"Alone"
02:01:54;02:01:58;"So come on over, yeah"
02:01:58;02:02:02;"Let's sit down a little while"
02:02:02;02:02:05;"Someone"
02:02:05;02:02:07;"You will find"
02:02:07;02:02:10;"The same things"
02:02:10;02:02:16;"The same things"
02:02:16;02:02:23;"The same things"
02:02:23;02:02:31;"The same things"
02:02:34;02:02:37;"Same things"
02:02:37;02:02:42;"By the time you read it"
02:02:42;02:02:48;"You kicked in the sun"
02:02:48;02:02:53;"It was all that you could do"
02:02:53;02:02:57;"How could you leave"
