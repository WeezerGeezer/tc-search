00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, back once again. Today we have an epic episode. We'll be talking"
00:08;00:15;"about old dudes and snack foods. Whether Flaming Hot Cheetos, Fritos, Bruce"
00:15;00:23;"Springsteen, or Phil Collins. This is a major episode. I hope you're sitting down."
00:23;00:26;"This is..."
00:26;00:33;"Time Crisis with Ben Siracane and BeeBeeBeeBeeBeeBeeBeeSport1."
00:33;00:47;"They passed me by, all of those great romances. The war I felt, war being me. All my rightful chances."
00:47;01:01;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy. And so I dealt to the floor. One of us had to go."
01:01;01:11;"Now it's different, I want you to know. One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:11;01:17;"Leave it on me, babe."
01:17;01:28;"Welcome back to Time Crisis. Got a hell of a show today. This show is really focusing on two Time Crisis classic topics."
01:28;01:38;"Classic rock and corporate history. We'll be hitting them both from different angles."
01:38;01:49;"I'm here joined by Jake. What's up Jake? We just ate some tacos. When I came into the studio, somebody got a bag of Flaming Hot Cheetos."
01:49;01:56;"We talked on the last episode a lot about the history of Flaming Hot Cheetos. I think it's possible I've never actually had any. Have you?"
01:56;02:02;"Richard Montanez. Richard Montanez invented them. Credited with the invention. No, I've never had them."
02:02;02:09;"I think maybe to start off the show we should just open it. Have you had regular Cheetos? Up on the mic."
02:09;02:20;"Yeah, I've had Cheetos. Maybe we'll each take a handful. You grab a few. I have to stretch to get it because this table is so huge here at Apple Studios in Culver City."
02:20;02:28;"I'm looking at the Cheetos. They're very red. Mmm."
02:28;02:36;"Okay, pretty mild initially. Yeah, that's not Flaming Hot. Maybe we got a defective bag. It lingers."
02:36;02:46;"I would barely even call that hot, let alone Flaming Hot. Yeah, I mean, if you were like 14, maybe that would blow your mind."
02:46;02:56;"But I've been putting Tabasco and hot sauce on eggs and things for like 25 years. So kind of like Chris Bale style."
02:56;03:03;"My level of hot is like ratcheted way up. But if you're like 12 or 14, those Cheetos might blow your mind."
03:03;03:08;"If you've never had anything spicy before? It does kind of linger. Honestly, if you..."
03:08;03:22;"Do you have to? Do you have to let it linger? I think if somebody told me those are regular Cheetos and I just grabbed a handful at a party or event, I wouldn't even think
twice."
03:22;03:31;"Right. Maybe we got a defective bag. Doubt it, dude. So that's how hot Flaming Hot Cheetos are. Is there a step above?"
03:31;03:43;"Ratcheted up a notch, dudes. Like crazy Flaming Hot? Probably. Three alarm, five alarm. Anyway, today's show is not about Flaming Hot Cheetos."
03:43;03:52;"I'm not going to eat any more of these. You're not going to eat any more? No. We also got some Fritos. Some Fritos scoops. I will talk about that later."
04:07;04:16;"Let's get right into it, Matt. Got a lot of stuff on the docket today. Yeah. Just to kick things off, a very disturbing story. Yeah?"
04:16;04:29;"Involving Time Crisis favorite, Phil Collins. Now, if I just asked you to guess who's more of a chill dude, Phil Collins or Paul McCartney, without any info, what would
your gut tell you?"
04:29;04:37;"Paul. Yeah, Paul in the Beatles. He was known as like kind of the sweet-natured one. Yeah. Kind of all-around nice guy."
04:37;04:48;"And as discussed on earlier episodes of the show, Phil has an incredibly conflicted and self-conscious relationship with his previous career. Yeah."
04:48;05:03;"He retired because he felt embarrassed and shamed by his emotionally outward 80s material. He felt that everybody thought Phil Collins was uncool. Right."
05:03;05:11;"So here's this poor guy living in Switzerland, collecting Civil War memorabilia. That's a real fact. Yeah. That's what Phil's into."
05:11;05:20;"And just feeling like the whole world hates him, where it couldn't be further from the truth. And a whole new generation of kids think ""In the Air Tonight"" is one of the
greatest songs of all time."
05:20;05:27;"But anyway. So he does not seem chill. And Paul seems like an all-around nice guy. Actually, I think about it. I met Paul McCartney briefly once. Oh, yeah?"
05:27;05:38;"It was at an industry event. Industry event? You know, I'm an industry professional. So I was at an industry event. Was this the barbecue that John Cougar Mellencamp
was at?"
05:38;05:49;"No, although that's a whole other story. I don't think I actually got to meet JCM at that party. I think maybe I briefly met his girlfriend. Christy Brinkley? Christy
Brinkley."
05:49;06:00;"No, this was at, there was this big Saturday Night Live 40th anniversary show. Oh, okay. I remember that. You had to wear a tuxedo. You went to that? I went to that."
06:00;06:13;"And you know who my date was? Do I know them? Yeah. Should I know them? It's a man. A musician? Yeah. Very closely associated with the time crisis. East Coast."
06:13;06:27;"Oh, Despot? Yeah. What? You and Despot were in tuxes. I had a plus one. So me and Despot. All due respect to Despot, but for some reason the way you phrased that, it made it
sound like you were someone's plus one."
06:27;06:35;"And I was like, oh, you were Despot's plus one. I'm pretty sure they invited everybody who'd ever been on the show before. That's right. Of course. You've played on it
three times."
06:35;06:44;"Three times. We're SNL veterans. That's deep, dude. I'll tell you one quick story about SNL. Now we're three Inception levels deep. We're going to get back to Phil
Collins."
06:44;06:55;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So my mom loves to go to sleep early. And in fact, the previous times when we played SNL and I'd be like, mom, you want to come to the show?"
06:55;07:02;"She'd always be like, what time does it start? 1130? She'd be like, can I come to the dress rehearsal? I can go home and go to sleep. And I'd be like, all right."
07:02;07:12;"So the third time we played, my mom comes, she watches the dress rehearsal, and then you have 30, 40 minutes before the real one starts. Okay."
07:12;07:21;"And then we got like a lot of buddies are there. It's like a fun, exciting atmosphere. And before she takes off, she comes to say hi, and she's kind of hanging backstage."
07:21;07:30;"And, you know, so she's hanging with the band and management and friends are there. Then as it gets closer and closer to the show, you know, there's all this excitement."
07:30;07:37;"And they were like filming an opening bit right outside the dressing room door. And I'm kind of like, all right, mom, well, like, do you want somebody to take you down and
get you in a car?"
07:37;07:49;"And she was like, well, I don't know. Maybe I'll stay for the beginning of the show. And I was like, all right. So then the energy of just like being on live TV, that SNL
energy, she ends up staying for the entire show."
07:49;08:02;"Then she comes to the after party. Your mom's going deep. Mom's going deep. She has like a, like a sip of alcohol. She feels drunk. She's like talking with like cousin
Asher, like she and Ross have a conversation."
08:02;08:09;"Of course, she's like at the SNL after party. And three in the morning. When all said and done, it's like three in the morning. And I remember she was having a great time."
08:09;08:19;"And I was like, and this is somebody who literally was trying to get in bed by 11, you know, a woman in her 60s. And I remember at the end of that, I said, mom, when's the last
time you stayed up until 3 a.m.?"
08:19;08:26;"And she said, no irony, the 70s. It was just that live TV energy."
32:50;32:51;"Beats one."
32:51;32:55;"Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
32:55;32:56;"All right, well, can I give you my take?"
32:56;32:57;"Yeah, yeah, get in there."
32:57;33:00;"When I heard the news on the radio, I pulled over."
33:00;33:05;"I was on the 101, it was really difficult to get over to the shoulder."
33:05;33:07;"But I knew I couldn't drive."
33:07;33:09;"I knew I had to process this information first."
33:09;33:13;"And at first, I was with you, I was like, I love Bob Dylan."
33:13;33:17;"He's won all sorts of Grammys, probably a Kennedy Center's Honor."
33:17;33:19;"Presidential medal."
33:19;33:20;"Yeah, whatever."
33:20;33:21;"Yeah."
33:21;33:24;"He's sitting on all sorts of awards."
33:24;33:25;"Yeah."
33:25;33:28;"So my first thought was, you know what, man?"
33:28;33:34;"Give the Nobel Prize in literature to someone who worked in poetry or fiction."
33:34;33:37;"Give Bob Dylan the Nobel Prize for music."
33:37;33:39;"Wah, wah, wah."
33:39;33:41;"Yeah, so then I composed myself."
33:41;33:43;"I started driving again."
33:43;33:47;"But I go home rather than the place I was going."
33:47;33:51;"And I sit down in front of my desktop computer."
33:51;33:56;"And I look up, I wanted to see who usually wins the Nobel Prize for music."
33:56;33:57;"And you know where I'm heading with this, Jake."
33:57;33:58;"Yeah, I do."
33:58;34:00;"It doesn't exist, man."
34:00;34:04;"Oh, I thought Eddie Van Halen won it last year."
34:04;34:08;"Searing, original, virtuosic guitar work."
34:08;34:10;"For the solo on ""Beat It."""
34:10;34:12;"Yeah."
34:12;34:13;"Eddie Van Halen."
34:13;34:16;"Well, you don't win it for--oh, I guess you do win it for--so anyway."
34:16;34:18;"There's only a handful of Nobel Prizes, man."
34:18;34:19;"Yeah."
34:19;34:26;"There's physics, economics, peace, maybe a couple other ones, and literature."
34:26;34:27;"I think that's it, actually."
34:27;34:29;"Okay, so maybe there's four."
34:29;34:30;"Yeah."
34:30;34:34;"So literature is the only Nobel Prize that even remotely deals with art."
34:34;34:35;"Yeah."
34:35;34:40;"And I'm not trying to say that physics and economics are not art, but I'm speaking in a very traditional sense."
34:40;34:44;"So the only one that has anything to do with art is the Nobel Prize for literature."
34:44;34:46;"And of course there's the Grammys."
34:46;34:47;"But you know what else, man?"
34:47;34:49;"There's the Man Booker Prize for books."
34:49;34:50;"There's the Pulitzer Prize."
34:50;34:51;"Sure, sure, sure."
34:51;34:52;"I get it."
34:52;35:03;"So it doesn't shock me that the Nobel Prize would say we only have one category that remotely deals with art or the written word"
35:03;35:07;"and that they might say we don't have to give it to a novelist every year."
35:07;35:15;"We want our committee to kind of look at anybody who's contributed to the written word, to the way people put together, blah, blah, blah."
35:15;35:17;"And when I thought about it that way, then I was like, you know what, man?"
35:17;35:19;"This is fine."
35:19;35:24;"I mean, I think people are just kind of fed up with Bob Dylan just because he's been winning for so long."
35:24;35:26;"And people are burned out on Boomer rock stars."
35:26;35:28;"Yeah, people are burned out on Boomer rock stars."
35:28;35:31;"But I'm trying to think."
35:31;35:36;"If they gave the Nobel Prize in literature to Kanye, I would support that."
35:36;35:38;"Of course you would have just like--"
35:38;35:40;"Maybe in 30 years."
35:40;35:41;"Okay, but yeah."
35:41;35:47;"In 30 years if they gave it to Kanye, of course I'm sure you'd also get op-eds saying why he doesn't deserve it."
35:47;35:50;"It would just be kind of a demographic shift about who liked it and who didn't like it."
35:50;36:04;"But on some basic level, as a musician, songwriter, lyricist, I'm not mad that they would look to music as yet another form of artistic word composition."
36:04;36:07;"And I'm trying to think if there's anything outside of that."
36:07;36:14;"If one day they gave the Nobel Prize in literature to someone who only did non-fiction, if one day they gave it to a blogger, I'd be with that."
36:14;36:15;"Sure."
36:15;36:19;"I like that they're expanding the definition and maybe they went with Bob Dylan as part of that."
36:19;36:21;"So I don't know."
36:21;36:25;"I just don't buy the argument that he should win a Grammy, not a Nobel Prize."
36:25;36:29;"Because the Nobel Prize is like this idiosyncratic, small, Swedish thing."
36:29;36:30;"Don't get it twisted."
36:30;36:34;"I mean, I know it's tough out there because people are buying less and less books."
36:34;36:44;"But just to put a button on this, Seinfeld 2000 just showed me an article that says the Nobel Academy says they can't find Bob Dylan to give him his prize."
36:44;36:50;"That's like when he won the Presidential Medal of Freedom or the Freedom Medal or whatever it's called."
36:50;36:53;"Obama was like, ""That's what I want out of Bob Dylan."
36:53;37:02;"I don't want Bob Dylan showing up here and being like ingratiating himself and being like all wowed by the proceedings."""
37:02;37:06;"He's like, ""I want Bob Dylan to be kind of caging and skeptical of the whole thing."""
37:06;37:08;"Sounds like Obama's a fan."
37:08;37:09;"Yeah."
37:09;37:15;"Okay, Jake, there's one more detail that maybe weakens my argument a little bit that Seinfeld 2000 is showing me."
37:15;37:20;"Because I was kind of thinking, ""Well, what does the Nobel Committee have to give Bob Dylan? Like a ribbon?"""
37:20;37:21;"A million dollars."
37:21;37:22;"Yeah, I didn't realize that."
37:22;37:23;"He basically gets a million dollars."
37:23;37:26;"$927,740."
37:26;37:28;"Okay."
37:28;37:37;"Now, when you put a cash prize on it, I guess I do question why you need to give cash money to a rich person."
37:37;37:38;"Yeah."
37:38;37:43;"And I would say that if Bob Dylan doesn't donate it, that's not a strong look."
37:43;37:44;"Yeah."
37:44;37:47;"If Bob Dylan donates the money, he's got it."
37:47;37:49;"You got to do it, Bob."
37:49;38:00;"But if Bob Dylan donates the money to a good charity, that's cooler than a tenured poetry professor getting it, I guess."
38:00;38:01;"Or it's equal."
38:01;38:02;"No, it's not."
38:02;38:03;"It's not."
38:03;38:04;"None of it's cool."
38:04;38:06;"Let's listen to some Dylan."
38:06;38:08;"What's a good one? ""Blown in the Wind""?"
38:08;38:13;"I was going to say ""Going, Going, Gone"" off 1974's ""Planet Waves."""
38:13;38:15;"Oh my God, that's deep."
38:15;38:20;"""Going, Going, Gone."""
38:20;38:21;"I love that song."
38:21;38:22;"All right, I'm not familiar."
38:22;38:24;"This was like a critically reviled album."
38:24;38:26;"Throw it on. It's like my favorite Dylan record."
38:26;38:27;"All right, let's check it out."
38:27;38:28;"""Planet Waves."""
38:28;38:31;"Here's Bob Dylan, Nobel Prize winner for literature."
38:31;38:34;"In one of his least literate songs."
38:34;38:36;"In one of his least literate songs."
38:36;38:38;"""Going, Going, Gone."""
38:38;38:46;"I just reached a place where the willow don't bend."
38:46;38:49;"There's not much more to be said."
38:49;38:53;"It's the top of the end."
38:53;38:58;"I'm going."
38:58;39:01;"I'm going."
39:01;39:03;"I'm going."
39:04;39:08;"I'm closing the book"
39:08;39:13;"On the pages and the tape"
39:13;39:17;"And I don't really care"
39:17;39:21;"Ooh, what happened there"
39:21;39:25;"I'm just going"
39:25;39:28;"I'm going"
39:31;39:33;"I'm going"
39:33;39:38;"I'm going"
39:38;39:45;"I've been hanging on the threads"
39:45;39:50;"I've been playing it straight"
39:50;39:53;"I've just got to cut loose"
39:53;39:58;"Before it gets late"
39:58;40:02;"So I'm going"
40:02;40:06;"I'm going"
40:06;40:09;"I'm going"
40:09;40:21;"I almost said, boy, go and follow your heart"
40:21;40:25;"And you'll be fine at the end of the line"
40:25;40:29;"All that's gone doesn't shine"
40:29;40:32;"On you and your one true love"
40:32;40:35;"Never part"
40:35;40:40;"I've been walking the road"
40:40;40:44;"I've been living on the edge"
40:44;40:47;"I've just got to go"
40:47;40:51;"Before I get to the ledge"
40:51;40:56;"So I'm going"
40:56;41:00;"I'm just going"
41:00;41:03;"I'm going"
41:25;41:29;"That was Bob Dylan with Goin' Goin' Gone. I'm gonna have my second handful of"
41:29;41:34;"Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Planet waves kids. From Planet Waves. That's the album, 74."
41:34;41:39;"By the way, I think we should make it clear, there's a lot of people because we"
41:39;41:42;"talk about a lot of Frito-Lay's products, people sometimes think we're sponsored"
41:42;41:51;"by them. We are. No, we're not. It's actually a merger between Apple and Frito-Lay."
41:51;41:58;"Apple has recently acquired Frito-Lay. No, look, we got no love for Frito-Lay."
41:58;42:04;"Well, we have like an ambivalent, skeptical, semi-ironic interest in Frito-Lay."
42:04;42:08;"I love Richard Montanez, the former janitor who invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos,"
42:08;42:16;"but everybody else up at Frito-Lay, I got no respect for. Wow. And I want everybody"
42:16;42:19;"to know, wrong words, that even though I'm eating Flamin' Hot Cheetos here, I'm"
42:19;42:25;"being completely honest. In my home, in my office."
42:25;42:29;"Alright, I was just informed we might have somebody from Frito-Lay come on the show,"
42:29;42:34;"maybe in the next episode, but I'm being honest. I don't have any Frito-Lay"
42:34;42:37;"products in my home or office, but we'll, you know, we'll respect that person as a"
42:37;42:41;"human being. Well, if that person is an executive, they probably don't have"
42:41;42:44;"Frito-Lay products either. Right, we learned that last time. Michael Moss"
42:44;42:48;"informed us of that. And also, we've just been informed by Seinfeld 2000, there is"
42:48;42:54;"a level up from Flamin' Hot Cheetos that's called Cheetos Crunchy Cheddar"
42:54;42:59;"Jalapeno Cheese Flavored Snacks. So, well, maybe we'll have to try those next time."
42:59;43:04;"That's a concise title. But again, we are not endorsing anything in the"
43:04;43:08;"Cheetos family. That was like nine words in that title. Nothing wrong with that,"
43:08;43:13;"man. If anything, they should hire us as consultants. It's like a transformer or something."
43:13;43:20;"So, we were talking earlier, before the show, about who else they could have"
43:20;43:25;"possibly gotten for Old Chella. And one name that came up was the boss himself,"
43:25;43:29;"Bruce Springsteen. Right. And we both kind of decided, Bruce is a generation removed"
43:29;43:33;"from the Stones and Dylan, so it doesn't surprise us. But, you know, it would have"
43:33;43:40;"made sense. Yeah. But we both have been reading Bruce's memoirs, which came out"
43:40;43:44;"recently. Yeah. My voice is starting to sound weird because of the Flamin' Hot"
43:44;43:48;"Cheetos. Acid reflux? Having a very negative reaction in my throat."
43:48;43:53;"Some Frida Lay executives listening to this right now, just driving their car"
43:53;43:59;"into a wall. Yeah. I feel quite ill. So, we're gonna talk about Bruce a little bit."
43:59;44:07;"Got a new book in stores now. It's called Born to Run. Hmm. That's one of his songs"
44:07;44:13;"and albums. What else is he gonna call it? It makes perfect sense. So, I"
44:13;44:18;"finished the book. You're still... I'm only 80 pages in. Okay. So, we're gonna talk a"
44:18;44:22;"little bit about our first impressions of the book, and then we're gonna skip"
44:22;44:25;"ahead because there's a specific Bruce song I'd like to talk about. Okay. So,"
44:25;44:29;"first of all, I'm a pretty big Bruce fan. Yeah. I grew up in New Jersey, after all,"
44:29;44:34;"where he's a very important artist. I already knew a lot about him. Yeah."
44:34;44:37;"Followed his career, but it was interesting for me the first few"
44:37;44:43;"chapters, he talks a lot about his family of origin. Talks about growing up in"
44:43;44:47;"Freehold, New Jersey, and that's always my favorite part of any book. Like the"
44:47;44:52;"Morrissey book, the first hundred pages. Interesting. Him describing growing up in"
44:52;44:59;"Manchester. ""Growing up, growing up."" I just like... It's so good. Like Morrissey talking"
44:59;45:04;"about like taking the bus in the rain to Johnny Marr's house. You know, like three"
45:04;45:08;"bus transfers through like grey Manchester, and it's like so depressing."
45:08;45:12;"He talks about his school, which was like a Victorian relic that was really cold. I"
45:12;45:15;"think you're just picturing like little boy Morrissey in like this freezing"
45:15;45:19;"Victorian school. In like the 70s. Yeah, just getting like his like knuckles like"
45:19;45:24;"smacked by like a teacher. So anyway, I like hearing about people's origins"
45:24;45:29;"because I'm often very familiar with like the career part. So, one thing that"
45:29;45:36;"I found interesting about Bruce is Springsteen is a weird name. Yeah. Like"
45:36;45:41;"let's keep it real. And you know, also in the Jewish community, people would often"
45:41;45:44;"be like, ""Is Bruce Springsteen Jewish?"" Because it almost sounds like when Jewish"
45:44;45:48;"people try to change their name a little bit. Like Springstein? Springstein. Right."
45:48;45:52;"Like maybe change to Springsteen. Not Jewish. Like Dutch and Welsh or something?"
45:52;45:56;"It's a Dutch name, but he doesn't identify with his Dutch heritage"
45:56;46:02;"whatsoever. Because whoever had that last name, Springsteen, was so so far back in"
46:02;46:05;"the family tree. And it's always funny how that happens. We've talked on the"
46:05;46:10;"show about Robert De Niro. One-quarter Italian. Right. But he has an Italian last"
46:10;46:15;"name. So you know that people assume that he's very Italian. Not to mention his"
46:15;46:20;"film career. But, so Springsteen, that's some dude, some Dutch guy way way back."
46:20;46:25;"And Bruce makes it clear that that side of his family was Irish. And the other"
46:25;46:29;"side of his family was Italian. And you know, for me growing up in New Jersey,"
46:29;46:36;"Irish-Italian is the most classic combo. Yeah. There's no way to verify this, but at"
46:36;46:40;"least within people of European descent intermarrying, I'm pretty sure that"
46:40;46:46;"Irish-Italian is the most common ethnic mixture. I believe that. In America. Well,"
46:46;46:51;"especially that region. North Jersey. Oh yeah. I think the armchair sociologist"
46:51;46:57;"reasoning would be that they went to church together. Right, right. So Irish-Italian,"
46:57;47:02;"very common mixtures. It's very near and dear to my heart. Thinking about the"
47:02;47:05;"last name thing. How like, you know, Springsteen, it's such like an"
47:05;47:11;"interesting name. So his mom's family, the Italian side, his grandfather was born in"
47:11;47:17;"Italy and got into some trouble. Did some time in jail. He has a chapter in the book"
47:17;47:21;"called ""The Italians."" There's a chapter called ""The Irish and the Italians."" Talking about"
47:21;47:32;"both sides of his family. Yeah, yeah. He also... Jesus. Flamin' Hots. Killing me, man. No more"
47:32;47:38;"Flamin' Hots for me. So his mom's family's last name was Zerilli. I might be"
47:38;47:45;"mispronouncing. It might be Zerilli. Z-E-R-I-L-L-I. Okay, yeah, Zerilli. Beautiful"
47:45;47:50;"Italian name. I'm just thinking, with all of us, it's luck of the draw what our"
47:50;47:55;"last name, you know, we live in this patriarchal... living this patriarchal"
47:55;48:04;"society. Take a swig of water, man. I'm a one handful of Flamin' Hot Cheetos guy. That's"
48:04;48:08;"where I'm at right now. And will remain. So, you know, we live in a patriarchal..."
48:08;48:12;"that's just a hard word to say, actually. Patriarchal? Wait. I thought it's"
48:12;48:17;"patriarchal. We live in a patriarchal... You know what, man? We live in a patriarchy."
48:17;48:26;"Where nine times out of ten, you take the dad's name, right? Bruce's dad. Right, you"
48:26;48:29;"took your dad's name. Yeah. You didn't have any choice in the matter."
48:29;48:37;"Neither did I. My mom's last name is Bass. Ezra Bass. Don't love it."
48:37;48:42;"What would your last name have been if we lived in a matriarchy? Connect."
48:42;48:49;"Connect? Yeah, German. K-N-E-C-H-T. Like Connect Auto Parts. No relation to the"
48:49;48:53;"Connect Auto Parts chain, but same name. That's so weird that it just sounds like"
48:53;48:58;"connect. Yeah, it sounds like the word connect, but it's... That sounds kind of"
48:58;49:06;"like a gangster, Jake Connect. Hey, man, if I want to get a little, uh, some of that stuff,"
49:06;49:10;"who would I talk to? Oh, you don't want to talk to me. You want to talk to Jake Connect."
49:10;49:17;"Jacob Connect. What's his last name? Connect. Connect. I know he's the Connect,"
49:17;49:20;"but, you know, what's his full name? Oh, you don't want to tell me his full name."
49:20;49:29;"I see. Jake Connect. Ezra Bass and Jake Connect. Those both sound weird, man."

51:32;51:35;"Welcome to ""Time Crisis"" with Ezra Bass and Jake Connect."
51:35;51:37;"Hi, I'm Ezra Bass."
51:37;51:38;"I'm Jake Connect."
51:38;51:40;"So we'll be talking about Bruce periodically"
51:40;51:42;"over the next couple months,"
51:42;51:43;"dipping in and out of the book."
51:43;51:44;"I'm psyched to read the whole book."
51:44;51:46;"I'm gonna spend, like, a weekend and just plow through it."
51:46;51:47;"It's a great book."
51:47;51:48;"Actually, I'm flying somewhere this weekend,"
51:48;51:50;"so I'm gonna take the book."
51:50;51:51;"Oh, perfect. Perfect for the plan."
51:51;51:54;"To and fro and just crush that book on the plane."
51:54;51:57;"Now, because this show's about music,"
51:57;51:59;"and we don't play enough music, always,"
51:59;52:01;"I wanna just focus in on one Bruce song."
52:01;52:02;"Okay."
52:02;52:04;"So we were talking about Bruce's early life,"
52:04;52:06;"growing up a young Irish-Italian-American"
52:06;52:08;"in New Jersey."
52:08;52:10;"But let's skip ahead to the '90s."
52:10;52:12;"Bruce is in his 40s."
52:12;52:14;"Already went through his superstar era."
52:14;52:15;"Totally."
52:15;52:16;"And he made a song that I've been listening to"
52:16;52:19;"a lot recently 'cause I really associate it"
52:19;52:20;"with being a kid."
52:20;52:22;"The song is ""Streets of Philadelphia."""
52:22;52:24;"It's a beautiful song."
52:24;52:25;"It was also interesting."
52:25;52:27;"He's a guy who's reinvented himself many times."
52:27;52:29;"A lot of people remember, maybe some people don't,"
52:29;52:33;"there was a big movie in 1994 called ""Philadelphia"""
52:33;52:36;"starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington."
52:36;52:37;"Directed by Jonathan Demme."
52:37;52:39;"Directed by Jonathan Demme."
52:39;52:41;"Kind of at the height of the AIDS crisis,"
52:41;52:43;"Tom Hanks is a closeted gay lawyer"
52:43;52:46;"working at a very conservative firm."
52:46;52:47;"I haven't seen it in a long time,"
52:47;52:48;"but I remember it's like there's these"
52:48;52:53;"kind of conservative, homophobic old lawyers."
52:53;52:56;"And he doesn't feel comfortable being out."
52:56;52:57;"Yeah."
52:57;52:58;"But then he gets AIDS."
52:58;53:01;"And he can't hide the lesions."
53:01;53:05;"And at that time, AIDS was demonized."
53:05;53:08;"I mean, it still is in many places."
53:08;53:09;"And they fire him."
53:09;53:10;"Yep."
53:10;53:11;"So now he's-- this guy's suffering,"
53:11;53:13;"dying from a disease."
53:13;53:15;"No job, no benefits, whatever."
53:15;53:18;"And he wants to sue his blue chip law firm."
53:18;53:21;"And the only lawyer who would take the case is Denzel,"
53:21;53:24;"who I think they make a point is kind of--"
53:24;53:25;"Slightly homophobic."
53:25;53:27;"Is slightly homophobic, but also like--"
53:27;53:28;"Or not slightly."
53:28;53:31;"But also an outsider, too, as a black man"
53:31;53:33;"working not at a blue chip Philadelphia law firm."
53:33;53:34;"Yep."
53:34;53:35;"Anybody in the room who's seen the movie"
53:35;53:38;"agree with my synopsis so far?"
53:38;53:40;"I've seen it within the last five years."
53:40;53:41;"And I agree."
53:41;53:42;"So Bruce writes a song for it called"
53:42;53:44;"""Streets of Philadelphia."""
53:44;53:46;"And first of all--"
53:46;53:47;"Start it. I want to hear it."
53:47;53:52;"So this is Bruce's first hip hop song, by the way."
53:52;53:54;"He programmed these drums."
53:54;53:55;"Oh, really?"
53:55;53:56;"Yeah, he says in the book,"
53:56;53:59;"""I was playing around on my drum machine,"
53:59;54:01;"did a kind of hip hop beat."""
54:01;54:03;"Maybe it's more trip hop."
54:03;54:06;"It's kind of crazy how long the beat goes."
54:06;54:10;"It's in case you want to freestyle over the beginning."
54:10;54:10;"I remember like--"
54:10;54:12;"Oh, listen to that vibey synth."
54:12;54:13;"It's so good."
54:13;54:15;"No guitars."
54:15;54:18;"I remember when this came out, I guess"
54:18;54:21;"I was probably 16 or something."
54:21;54:23;"So I was pretty familiar with Bruce's reputation"
54:23;54:24;"and his work."
54:24;54:26;"But I remember the drum machine was like so jarring"
54:26;54:28;"and like weirdly lo-fi."
54:28;54:29;"Yeah."

54:39;54:40;"I couldn't hang with it in '93."

55:06;55:07;"That's that '90s Bruce."
55:07;55:11;"Did he make an album of like synth?"
55:11;55:12;"He didn't."
55:12;55:13;"No."
55:13;55:14;"'Cause he did ""Keep in Touch"" in '92"
55:14;55:17;"and he did ""Tom Joe"" in '95."
55:17;55:18;"I wish he had done an album just like--"

56:44;56:49;"But one thing I find very moving about this song"
56:49;56:53;"is also, like, just to go back to 1993."
56:53;56:54;"Yeah."
56:54;56:56;"It's, like, incredible the opposition there was"
56:56;56:58;"to helping people with AIDS."
56:58;57:00;"People saying the craziest stuff."
57:00;57:02;"The Reagans especially had a shameful history"
57:02;57:05;"of how they dealt with the epidemic."
57:05;57:07;"So also just to think about back then,"
57:07;57:11;"Bruce Springsteen, he was known as the voice"
57:11;57:13;"of the working-class American."
57:13;57:14;"Right."
57:14;57:15;"And he was, you know,"
57:15;57:16;"especially born in the USA era,"
57:16;57:20;"he was this kind of, like, jacked, all-American dude."
57:20;57:22;"Kind of like an icon of a certain type"
57:22;57:26;"of, like, heterosexual American maleness."
57:26;57:27;"Right."
57:27;57:28;"And..."
57:28;57:29;"You could misconstrue that"
57:29;57:31;"for, like, a John Wayne sort of..."
57:31;57:32;"You could-- yeah, you could--"
57:32;57:33;"Boneheaded patriotism."
57:33;57:34;"But--"
57:34;57:37;"As famously Ronald Reagan shouted him out"
57:37;57:38;"in the ""Born in the USA"" era,"
57:38;57:40;"even though that song was a critique"
57:40;57:42;"of the way that, you know, working-class people"
57:42;57:44;"have been treated in this country."
57:44;57:45;"Maybe today so much has shifted,"
57:45;57:47;"it wouldn't be as meaningful."
57:47;57:48;"But to picture this guy,"
57:48;57:50;"this icon of, like, working-class,"
57:50;57:53;"kind of heterosexual masculinity"
57:53;57:54;"writing a song for a movie"
57:54;57:57;"that was about a gay man"
57:57;57:59;"being totally, like, brutalized..."
57:59;58:00;"And dying."
58:00;58:02;"And dying by this disease"
58:02;58:03;"and being mistreated"
58:03;58:07;"by this homophobic rich people,"
58:07;58:09;"that Bruce would put the same eye"
58:09;58:12;"that was kind of, like, known for talking about"
58:12;58:13;"the dude whose factory closed down"
58:13;58:15;"and that he would then be singing about"
58:15;58:18;"an abused gay man dying of AIDS,"
58:18;58:19;"that was, like, very meaningful."
58:19;58:20;"-And, you know... -Yeah, it's interesting."
58:20;58:22;"And you also think about, like,"
58:22;58:23;"you know, like, it would be pretty lame"
58:23;58:26;"if Bruce only cared about, um..."
58:26;58:28;"-Blue-collar guys in Jersey. -Blue-collar guys"
58:28;58:29;"in Jersey's factory closed down."
58:29;58:31;"He's a progressive to the bone."
58:31;58:32;"Just like a good politician,"
58:32;58:34;"he cares about all people who are oppressed"
58:34;58:37;"by the horrendous system."
58:37;58:38;"I just find the lines in it so moving,"
58:38;58:41;"like, ""saw my reflection in a window,"
58:41;58:42;"didn't know my own face."""
58:42;58:44;"Talking about a guy dying from a disease,"
58:44;58:45;"it's awful."
58:45;58:47;"He's probably lost weight."
58:47;58:50;"Yeah, as happens in the movie."
58:50;58:51;"Yeah, interesting that Neil Young"
58:51;58:53;"also did a song for the movie."
58:53;58:54;"Right, so Neil Young also did a song"
58:54;58:55;"-for Philadelphia... -Called ""Philadelphia."""
58:55;58:56;"...called ""Philadelphia."""
58:56;58:59;"But it really got lost in the shuffle,"
58:59;59:01;"'cause ""Streets of Philadelphia"" was, like, a big hit."
59:01;59:02;"It's interesting to think about him"
59:02;59:05;"having maybe the same internal debate"
59:05;59:07;"that Bruce might have had in '93,"
59:07;59:11;"of, like, ""Oh, do I want to attach my name"
59:11;59:13;"to this really progressive cause?"
59:13;59:14;"Yes, I do."""
59:14;59:16;"-Right. -Something about Neil and Bruce"
59:16;59:17;"both writing a song for that movie,"
59:17;59:19;"like, makes sense in a..."
59:19;59:20;"They're, like, the progressive guys"
59:20;59:21;"-for that mode. -Yeah."
59:21;59:24;"Ted Nugent is the other side of the spectrum."
59:24;59:26;"I'm sure Ted Nugent was not getting a call."
59:26;59:28;"-Nugent's phone wasn't ringing. -Yeah."
59:28;59:30;"So one thing I found interesting about that song"
59:30;59:31;"is there's a really iconic video,"
59:31;59:33;"which I encourage everybody to watch"
59:33;59:34;"if you haven't seen it."
59:34;59:36;"For those who remember, it's, like, this video"
59:36;59:37;"of kind of just, like, early Bruce,"
59:37;59:39;"probably '43, '44."
59:39;59:41;"-Goatee. -Goatee."
59:41;59:43;"His kind of '90s Bruce look."
59:43;59:45;"Kind of slightly messy hair,"
59:45;59:46;"wearing, like, just a leather jacket."
59:46;59:48;"Looking like a very normal dude"
59:48;59:50;"walking the streets of Philadelphia."
59:50;59:51;"Like a chain-link fence."
59:51;59:53;"Yeah, a lot of chain-link fence,"
59:53;59:55;"like, kids playing, homeless people."
59:55;59:58;"Just showing, like, kind of the joy and pain"
59:58;01:00:00;"of an American city."
01:00:00;01:00:02;"And because Bruce knew that this was, like,"
01:00:02;01:00:05;"a very emotional, meaningful song,"
01:00:05;01:00:07;"he didn't want to lip-sync."
01:00:07;01:00:08;"Interesting."
01:00:08;01:00:11;"99% of videos, you lip-sync."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"-Right. -Because otherwise,"
01:00:12;01:00:15;"you're not playing the recording of the song."
01:00:15;01:00:16;"You record the vocals in the studio,"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"-and then you pretend to sing. -Yeah."
01:00:18;01:00:21;"So Bruce insisted on wearing a microphone"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"so that he could actually sing as he's talking."
01:00:23;01:00:26;"So if you listen to the video version,"
01:00:26;01:00:29;"you'll notice the vocals sound a little funny,"
01:00:29;01:00:30;"and you hear all this ambient noise,"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"like his shirt rustling,"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"his feet crunching on the ground."
01:00:34;01:00:39;"[dark music]"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"So it was the integrity of the subject matter"
01:00:41;01:00:42;"that determined..."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"Yeah, he lips--"
01:00:44;01:00:45;"-Dancing in the dark or whatever. -Yeah,"
01:00:45;01:00:46;"he's no stranger to lip-syncing."
01:00:46;01:00:48;"But he's just like, ""I can't, with a straight face,"
01:00:48;01:00:51;"-lip-sync about this heavy issue."" -Yeah."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"[dark music]"
01:00:53;01:00:55;"Oh, wow, yeah."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"Like, it doesn't have the same reverb."

01:04:14;01:04:19;"Uh, it kind of looks like he's wearing black jeans."
01:04:19;01:04:22;"He's wearing a black suit jacket, no tie."
01:04:22;01:04:24;"Thank you."
01:04:24;01:04:28;"See, this is the first song I ever wrote for a motion picture,"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"so I guess it's all down to me."
01:04:30;01:04:31;"Really? It's the first song?"

01:04:34;01:04:37;"Neil, I got to share this with you."

01:04:38;01:04:41;"They don't cut to him at that moment."
01:04:41;01:04:42;"I think he is there."
01:04:42;01:04:43;"Yeah, you do your best work"
01:04:43;01:04:47;"and you hope that it pulls out the best in your audience,"
01:04:47;01:04:51;"but some piece of it spills over into the real world"
01:04:51;01:04:53;"and into people's everyday lives,"
01:04:53;01:04:56;"and it takes the edge off the fear"
01:04:56;01:04:58;"and allows us to recognize each other"
01:04:58;01:05:01;"through our veil of differences."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"I always thought that was one of the things"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"popular art was supposed to be about,"
01:05:05;01:05:07;"along with the merchandising and all the other stuff."
01:05:07;01:05:11;"But, uh, I just want to say thank you, Jonathan,"
01:05:11;01:05:14;"for having me as a part of your picture."
01:05:14;01:05:18;"Um, glad my song has contributed to its ideas"

01:05:20;01:05:21;"Uh, love you, Pats,"
01:05:21;01:05:24;"and thank you all for inviting me to your party."

01:05:27;01:05:30;"Bruce is a very articulate guy."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"Then they cut to Tom Hanks in the audience."
01:05:32;01:05:34;"Got a look on his face like, ""What a guy."""
01:05:34;01:05:35;"Yeah."
01:05:35;01:05:38;"Just clapping, turning to his wife, Rita Wilson."
01:05:38;01:05:39;"Just like, ""What a guy."""
01:05:39;01:05:41;"I like Bruce getting all philosophical"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"about the role of popular arts."
01:05:43;01:05:44;"Yeah, that's a good point."
01:05:44;01:05:46;"I mean, people don't go there, you know?"
01:05:46;01:05:47;"The one thing I'll say is --"
01:05:47;01:05:51;"and maybe it's because this is 22 years ago."
01:05:51;01:05:53;"I feel like Bruce used somewhat coded language."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"Maybe he felt like it wasn't his place"
01:05:55;01:05:57;"to talk about the meaning of the film."
01:05:57;01:06:00;"He said, ""Hopefully popular art"
01:06:00;01:06:03;"lets us look past the fear"
01:06:03;01:06:05;"to treat each other like human beings or whatever"
01:06:05;01:06:07;"and see through the veil of difference."""
01:06:07;01:06:08;"So clearly he's talking about the fear"
01:06:08;01:06:11;"and the stigma attached to AIDS."
01:06:11;01:06:12;"But I feel like -- I don't know."
01:06:12;01:06:15;"I feel like in 2016,"
01:06:15;01:06:16;"we would kind of expect him to say"
01:06:16;01:06:17;"something slightly more explicit."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"About, like, homophobia or..."
01:06:19;01:06:21;"Yeah."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"I believe Bruce's heart is very much in the right place, but..."
01:06:23;01:06:24;"Yeah."
01:06:24;01:06:25;"No, that's true."
01:06:25;01:06:29;"In '93, I mean, I remember"

01:06:42;01:06:44;"And then my other parent was like, ""Really?"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"Like, I've been married to you for this long,"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"and you're, like, weirded out by that?"

01:06:53;01:06:55;"and I was sort of like, ""Wow."

01:07:00;01:07:02;"I mean, it was the first time that idea"
01:07:02;01:07:03;"had, like, come to the mainstream"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"and probably it occurred to them."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"I'd like to imagine that both your parents"

01:21:43;01:21:45;"- Well, Matt sent along-- it looks like a photograph,"
01:21:45;01:21:48;"maybe out of, like, a magazine ad from the '90s."
01:21:48;01:21:50;"It was an ad for ""Hitline USA."""

01:21:58;01:21:59;"- Some of the promotional materials."

01:23:29;01:23:32;"- Pepsi at least has stayed true to this,"
01:23:32;01:23:35;"you know, being the youthful brand."
01:23:35;01:23:36;"Coke occasionally veers youthful,"
01:23:36;01:23:38;"but Coke's a heritage brand."
01:23:38;01:23:40;"Pepsi, even though it's been around for a long time,"
01:23:40;01:23:43;"will always be the second born,"
01:23:43;01:23:46;"the young gun, the up and comer."
01:23:46;01:23:50;"So Pepsi still does more partnerships with superstars."
01:23:50;01:23:53;"They're paying super big bucks"
01:23:53;01:23:54;"to work with the Billy Joels of their day."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"So who's the Billy Joel of today?"
01:23:56;01:23:57;"- Obviously Beyonce."
01:23:57;01:23:58;"- Obviously Beyonce."
01:23:58;01:24:02;"- Wholesome songwriting, American songwriting."
01:24:02;01:24:03;"- Both superstars,"
01:24:03;01:24:07;"both arguably the Pele's of their genre,"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"both the Pizza Hut's now."
01:24:09;01:24:12;"But, so Beyonce, I guess her tour is somehow"
01:24:12;01:24:14;"sponsored by Pepsi."
01:24:14;01:24:15;"Now this is some beef I definitely"
01:24:15;01:24:16;"don't want to get into,"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"but I'd be remiss not to mention it."
01:24:17;01:24:19;"- So does that mean like the Pepsi logo"
01:24:19;01:24:21;"is on her stage?"
01:24:21;01:24:22;"- I went to a Beyonce show,"
01:24:22;01:24:24;"I didn't notice any Pepsi branding."
01:24:24;01:24:25;"- But what's the beef?"
01:24:25;01:24:26;"- I guess Bon Iver was doing some press"
01:24:26;01:24:27;"for his new album."
01:24:27;01:24:28;"- That's right, I did hear that."
01:24:28;01:24:30;"- And he made a kind of negative statement"
01:24:30;01:24:32;"about Beyonce's ties to Pepsi."
01:24:32;01:24:34;"He said that's, you're not a good role model"
01:24:34;01:24:35;"if you take two million dollars from Pepsi."
01:24:35;01:24:36;"- Right."
01:24:36;01:24:37;"- And I'm a fan of both."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"- Okay, I saw that article too."
01:24:38;01:24:40;"And he actually mentioned"
01:24:40;01:24:42;"that he had done a Bushmills ad."
01:24:42;01:24:43;"- And he regretted it."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"- And regretted it."
01:24:45;01:24:46;"- We've touched on this before on this show."
01:24:46;01:24:48;"The sort of, we're talking about the Shins"
01:24:48;01:24:51;"doing a McDonald's ad like 20 years ago."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"It used to be completely stigmatized"
01:24:53;01:24:54;"if you were like,"
01:24:54;01:24:55;"especially if you were an indie rocker"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"like Bon Iver."
01:24:56;01:24:58;"- Now it's just the world we live in, man."
01:24:58;01:24:59;"You know, the only person who could actually"
01:24:59;01:25:02;"settle this beef, because Bon Iver and Beyonce"
01:25:02;01:25:04;"are both great, iconic artists."
01:25:04;01:25:06;"I have admiration for both of them."
01:25:06;01:25:06;"- Yeah."
01:25:06;01:25:09;"- I am not in a position to settle this beef."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"The only person who could really say who's right"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"I think is Billy Joel."
01:25:13;01:25:16;"Because he and Bon Iver are both in the"
01:25:16;01:25:18;"Caucasian singer songwriter tradition."
01:25:18;01:25:21;"But Billy and Beyonce have both partnered up"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"with Pepsi to promote their albums."
01:25:23;01:25:26;"So he can kind of see both sides here."
01:25:26;01:25:30;"I guess we don't have any contact info for Billy."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"Man, imagine one day we get Billy on the show."
01:25:32;01:25:33;"- I bet Billy would just be like,"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"play ball, dude."
01:25:35;01:25:37;"- I think Billy would definitely take Beyonce's side."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"- Yeah, of course."
01:25:38;01:25:39;"I mean, how could he not?"
01:25:39;01:25:42;"- I think Billy, kind of like Phil Collins,"
01:25:42;01:25:45;"often felt abused by the cool kids."
01:25:45;01:25:46;"- Right."
01:25:46;01:25:49;"- So I think even though Bon Iver is like,"
01:25:49;01:25:52;"to me, seems like a humble, cool guy,"
01:25:52;01:25:55;"I bet Billy would see him and be like,"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"oh man, you're just another hipster."
01:25:57;01:25:59;"- He would think Bon Iver is like Bruce."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"- Right, and Billy definitely had a chip"
01:26:01;01:26:01;"on his shoulder about Bruce."
01:26:01;01:26:03;"He'd be like--"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"- You're not gonna see Bruce doing a Pepsi sponsored thing."
01:26:05;01:26:06;"- Yeah, I think Billy would definitely see"
01:26:06;01:26:09;"more of himself in Beyonce and be like,"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"you know what, man?"
01:26:11;01:26:13;"That guy making his weird experimental music,"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"he wants to take you down a peg"
01:26:15;01:26:16;"for partnering up with Pepsi,"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"but at the end of the day, who's selling more tickets?"
01:26:18;01:26:19;"It's you, Beyonce."
01:26:19;01:26:23;"Who's writing songs that really resonate with people?"
01:26:23;01:26:24;"It's you, Beyonce."
01:26:24;01:26:25;"- Okay, how about this, though?"
01:26:25;01:26:26;"- Yeah."
01:26:26;01:26:27;"- On the other hand,"
01:26:27;01:26:30;"I feel like soda consciousness has been raised."
01:26:30;01:26:32;"So in the 80s or the early 90s,"
01:26:32;01:26:35;"people were like, what's wrong with sugar?"
01:26:35;01:26:36;"You drink soda, it's fine."
01:26:36;01:26:37;"And now it's like,"
01:26:37;01:26:40;"post-Bloomberg, all this stuff,"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"soda is like, people talk about soda"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"like it's toxic waste."
01:26:44;01:26:45;"- Right, early 90s--"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"- Like childhood obesity, all this stuff."
01:26:47;01:26:50;"I mean, it is a little tone deaf, I think, of Beyonce."
01:26:50;01:26:50;"- Oh."
01:26:50;01:26:52;"- To partner up with Pepsi."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"I think it's kind of a lame look."
01:26:53;01:26:56;"Also, it's like, why does she need to do that?"
01:26:56;01:26:58;"She's loaded."
01:26:58;01:26:59;"I don't understand what she's doing."
01:26:59;01:27:00;"- I'm sure she has her reasons."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"- I'm sure."
01:27:01;01:27:03;"- Why do you assume that she's loaded, man?"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"Do you have her routing number?"
01:27:05;01:27:06;"- Actually, I do, dude."
01:27:06;01:27:08;"- Okay, maybe--"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"- I'm not trying to get all controversial"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"and insane on Beyonce."
01:27:12;01:27:14;"I'm just saying, okay,"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"you could conceivably partner up with a brand."
01:27:16;01:27:19;"If you're a rock star, you can,"
01:27:19;01:27:23;"you know, like a benevolent, loving brand like Apple."
01:27:23;01:27:26;"You could partner with them, it'd be fine."
01:27:26;01:27:28;"But it's like a funny look, I think,"
01:27:28;01:27:31;"to partner up with a soda."
01:27:31;01:27:33;"And her fans are kids."
01:27:33;01:27:34;"I understand his point."
01:27:34;01:27:37;"His fans are people in their 20s and 30s."
01:27:37;01:27:38;"Maybe the teenagers."
01:27:38;01:27:40;"I mean, maybe Bush Mills was a bad look."
01:27:40;01:27:41;"I think maybe--"
01:27:41;01:27:42;"- I guess he said he regrets it."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"- It'd be interesting to see why he regretted it,"
01:27:44;01:27:46;"if it was because if it was booze or if it was--"
01:27:46;01:27:47;"- Or just because it was an ad."
01:27:47;01:27:49;"- Just because it was an ad."
01:27:49;01:27:50;"- Here's one question."
01:27:50;01:27:51;"Do you think there's anybody"
01:27:51;01:27:54;"who was a Bon Iver fan,"
01:27:54;01:27:57;"who loved Pepsi,"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"who saw those comments,"
01:27:59;01:28:00;"and who was like, you know what,"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"I'm not gonna buy the new album?"
01:28:01;01:28:02;"- No."
01:28:02;01:28:04;"- Not even like a handful of people."
01:28:04;01:28:07;"- That would choose loyalty for Pepsi over Bon Iver."
01:28:07;01:28:09;"- Somewhere in rural Wisconsin."
01:28:09;01:28:10;"- Well, especially not there."
01:28:10;01:28:12;"- In the making of a murderer town."
01:28:12;01:28:13;"- Oh, man."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"- Somebody who's like a Bon Iver fan"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"waiting for the next album,"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"but also heavily identified."
01:28:19;01:28:20;"Maybe they grew up during the Cola Wars,"
01:28:20;01:28:21;"and they chose sides,"
01:28:21;01:28:22;"and they heavily identified with Pepsi."
01:28:22;01:28:24;"- Maybe their dad was a Pepsi distributor."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"- Northern Midwest."
01:28:26;01:28:28;"- They don't care about the Beyonce angle,"
01:28:28;01:28:31;"but then Bon Iver comes out with these anti--"
01:28:31;01:28:32;"You know, it's funny, too, man."
01:28:32;01:28:34;"People just wanna see beef."
01:28:34;01:28:35;"They wanna see like artist on artist beef."
01:28:35;01:28:39;"So the takeaway from that Bon Iver interview"
01:28:39;01:28:42;"was Bon Iver criticizes Beyonce."
01:28:42;01:28:44;"Okay, like Beyonce's an icon,"
01:28:44;01:28:46;"but is Pepsi not an icon?"
01:28:46;01:28:47;"- Yeah."
01:28:47;01:28:48;"- What I saw there,"
01:28:48;01:28:49;"what I found way more provocative"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"was Bon Iver criticizing Pepsi."
01:28:50;01:28:53;"- Yeah, no, I hear you, man."
01:28:53;01:28:55;"- I hate seeing two artists I admire get into beef, man."
01:28:55;01:28:57;"- I don't think it's even beef."
01:28:57;01:28:58;"- I wonder if Beyonce knows about it."
01:28:58;01:29:00;"- Him expressing an opinion--"
01:29:00;01:29:01;"- I'm gonna tell her."
01:29:01;01:29:04;"- Him expressing an opinion"
01:29:04;01:29:06;"about her corporate partnership"
01:29:06;01:29:09;"and him kind of like disparaging it"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"is not like beef."
01:29:10;01:29:12;"That's like him extending an opinion."
01:29:12;01:29:15;"- He's Paul McCartney, she's Phil Collins."
01:29:15;01:29:16;"It's beef, man."
01:29:16;01:29:17;"- It's not beef."
01:29:17;01:29:18;"- If that's not beef, then what is?"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"- It's not beef 'cause maybe she heard that"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"from like her publicist and was like,"
01:29:22;01:29:24;"uh-huh, what else you got?"
01:29:24;01:29:26;"- You know what I would do if I was Beyonce?"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"- Crack a Pepsi."
01:29:28;01:29:29;"(laughing)"
01:29:29;01:29:32;"- I was gonna say mail him a two-liter, but."
01:29:32;01:29:33;"(laughing)"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"- Just a warm two-liter."
01:29:35;01:29:36;"- A warm two-liter."
01:29:36;01:29:38;"Drink up, Justin."
01:29:38;01:29:41;"Oh God."
01:29:41;01:29:42;"You know what?"
01:29:42;01:29:43;"They're both right."
01:29:43;01:29:46;"(laughing)"

01:31:47;01:31:49;"Garth Brooks and Fritos coming together."
01:31:49;01:31:52;"Is Bon Iver gonna start talking"
01:31:52;01:31:53;"about the Garth Brooks Fritos thing?"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"(laughing)"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"If he's asked about it directly,"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"we should tweet at him, dude."
01:31:59;01:32:01;"We should get him on."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"Yeah, let's do it."
01:32:02;01:32:03;"No, see, I would tweet at him,"
01:32:03;01:32:06;"but I feel like I truly respect and admire him."
01:32:06;01:32:08;"I've only met him once, but he was a truly kind person."
01:32:08;01:32:09;"I think he's a great artist."
01:32:09;01:32:11;"I feel like if I tweeted at him,"
01:32:11;01:32:12;"""Hey man, what do you think"
01:32:12;01:32:14;"about the Garth Brooks Fritos thing?"""
01:32:14;01:32:16;"He would interpret that as shade."
01:32:16;01:32:17;"Yeah, I got it."
01:32:17;01:32:18;"There's no way that he would see that"
01:32:18;01:32:19;"and be like, ""Oh, cool."""
01:32:19;01:32:22;"Like, well, man, I guess in that situation,"
01:32:22;01:32:23;"like he would just see that and just be like,"
01:32:23;01:32:24;"""You know what, man?"""
01:32:24;01:32:27;"I'm pretty sure he got a river of just BS"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"after that article, too, I'm sure."
01:32:29;01:32:30;"He's just getting interviewed for something."
01:32:30;01:32:32;"That might have literally been 30 seconds."
01:32:32;01:32:33;"Oh, I'm sure."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"In a three hour hand session."
01:32:34;01:32:35;"I'm sure it was."
01:32:35;01:32:36;"And then that becomes the takeaway."
01:32:36;01:32:38;"Of course."
01:32:38;01:32:41;"So anyway, shout out to Garth, Billy,"
01:32:41;01:32:44;"Beyonce, and Justin."
01:32:44;01:32:46;"We love you all equally."
01:32:46;01:32:47;"And you're all right."
01:32:47;01:32:50;"On the Fritos bag, there's a code"
01:32:50;01:32:54;"you can enter into a website called Free Garth Song,"
01:32:54;01:32:55;"what is it?"
01:32:55;01:32:58;"Freegarthmusic.com?"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"Freegarthsong.com?"
01:33:00;01:33:03;"Okay, so go to your store, don't buy Fritos,"
01:33:03;01:33:06;"just take the bag, shoot a picture of it"
01:33:06;01:33:08;"with your phone, enter in the free promo code"
01:33:08;01:33:12;"into freegarthmusic.com, and listen to what"
01:33:12;01:33:14;"I'm sure is a terrible song."
01:33:14;01:33:16;"Oh!"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"I'm sure it's great."
01:33:18;01:33:20;"Garth Brooks sucks."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"I know he's like one of the biggest,"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"like, 90s sellers."
01:33:23;01:33:25;"He's the best selling solo artist"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"in American history, man."
01:33:27;01:33:29;"He's the best selling solo artist"
01:33:29;01:33:30;"in American history."
01:33:30;01:33:30;"Really?"
01:33:30;01:33:31;"Bigger than--"
01:33:31;01:33:32;"Beyonce?"
01:33:32;01:33:35;"Bigger than Bon Iver and Beyonce put together."
01:33:35;01:33:36;"Get out of here."
01:33:36;01:33:38;"Yeah, man."
01:33:38;01:33:39;"Numero uno."
01:33:39;01:33:40;"That is brutal."
01:33:40;01:33:41;"And you want to talk about some--"
01:33:41;01:33:42;"Bigger than Elvis?"
01:33:42;01:33:43;"Yeah, man."
01:33:43;01:33:44;"Michael Jackson?"
01:33:44;01:33:45;"No, that's not true."
01:33:45;01:33:47;"That is not true."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"Michael Jackson put out far fewer records."
01:33:49;01:33:50;"Jesus."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"Man, we could go even deeper on this,"
01:33:52;01:33:53;"but I think it's time for top five."
01:33:53;01:33:54;"You ready?"
01:33:54;01:33:54;"Yeah."
01:33:54;01:33:55;"All right, let's get in."
01:33:55;01:34:02;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:34:02;01:34:05;"Today, because we covered so much ground, man,"
01:34:05;01:34:08;"we talked about Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen, Bon Iver,"
01:34:08;01:34:10;"Beyonce, Phil Collins, Paul McCartney."
01:34:10;01:34:12;"We covered so much ground today."
01:34:12;01:34:15;"Hot Cheetos, Fritos."
01:34:15;01:34:17;"We don't have time to do comparative top five."
01:34:17;01:34:18;"I hate that."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"Why?"
01:34:19;01:34:23;"Because the top five of 2016 only means anything to me."
01:34:23;01:34:24;"In context."
01:34:24;01:34:27;"You like to compare the old songs to the new songs?"
01:34:27;01:34:31;"Yeah, it just gives it like a sense of context."
01:34:31;01:34:34;"So I can like sort of get a handle on it."
01:34:34;01:34:35;"I'm sorry, man."
01:34:35;01:34:35;"We don't have time."
01:34:35;01:34:36;"We're going to go cold."
01:34:36;01:34:37;"We're going to go cold."
01:34:37;01:34:39;"We're just doing the top five songs on iTunes"
01:34:39;01:34:40;"right now in 2016."
01:34:40;01:34:41;"You know why?"
01:34:41;01:34:44;"Because we're going to hear the same crappy Chainsmokers song."
01:34:44;01:34:48;"And if we could compare it to something new,"
01:34:48;01:34:51;"new for the show, that is, then there's"
01:34:51;01:34:52;"like a new way to talk about it."
01:34:52;01:34:54;"When I hear you talk about Chainsmokers,"
01:34:54;01:34:59;"I totally can picture that conservative dad whose kid"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"is watching Elvis on TV."
01:35:01;01:35:03;"Turn that crap off."
01:35:03;01:35:04;"I don't get it."
01:35:04;01:35:12;"No, because Elvis was disturbing and transgressive and new."
01:35:12;01:35:14;"Everything that Chainsmokers are not."
01:35:14;01:35:18;"The Chainsmokers are pandering, unoriginal, and corporate."
01:35:18;01:35:19;"You seem pretty disturbed by that."
01:35:22;01:35:23;"Cliche."
01:35:23;01:35:24;"We don't want to get into it, but there"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"has been a lot of Chainsmokers beef, by the way."
01:35:26;01:35:26;"So--"
01:35:26;01:35:27;"Let's get into it."
01:35:27;01:35:28;"Well, we'll talk about it later."
01:35:28;01:35:29;"But I just want you to know, you're"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"saying all this negative stuff about Chainsmokers."
01:35:31;01:35:36;"They're currently embroiled in a lot of beef right now."
01:35:36;01:35:38;"You're kicking them when they're down."
01:35:38;01:35:40;"I guarantee you--"
01:35:40;01:35:41;"Yeah."
01:35:41;01:35:45;"--they don't give even one ounce of a crap"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"about what I have to say."
01:35:47;01:35:49;"Don't sell yourself short, man."
01:35:49;01:35:50;"Do you guys hear--"
01:35:50;01:35:51;"OK, do you know Vampire Weekend?"
01:35:51;01:35:53;"You heard of them."
01:35:53;01:35:54;"OK, so the singer--"
01:35:54;01:35:55;"Favorite band."
01:35:55;01:35:56;"They haven't put out a record in a while."
01:35:56;01:35:59;"The singer has a show."
01:35:59;01:36:03;"OK, he has got some jack-off friend who's the co-host."
01:36:03;01:36:05;"Apparently, he was saying some crazy crap about us"
01:36:05;01:36:06;"on the show."
01:36:06;01:36:07;"What was he saying?"
01:36:07;01:36:10;"That we're just like sellouts and lame?"
01:36:10;01:36:12;"Oh."
01:36:12;01:36:14;"That's how that conversation went."
01:36:14;01:36:15;"Fair enough, man."
01:36:15;01:36:20;"Pass me another Cuban cigar and a glass of fine wine"
01:36:20;01:36:22;"at this gorgeous beachfront villa."
01:36:22;01:36:23;"You got it, bro."
01:36:23;01:36:26;"Get my broker on the line."
01:36:26;01:36:27;"Get my broker on the line."
01:36:27;01:36:30;"I want to sell all my Apple stock."
01:36:30;01:36:32;"OK, number five on the charts."
01:36:32;01:36:34;"All right."
01:36:34;01:36:37;"God, you really set this up to be a very negative top five, man."
01:36:37;01:36:39;"You brought a lot of negative energy to it."
01:36:39;01:36:43;"And I have a feeling you're only going to get more negative"
01:36:43;01:36:44;"once you hear the number."
01:36:44;01:36:45;"All my friends are idiots."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"Oh, God."
01:36:48;01:36:51;"How is this still on the top five?"
01:36:51;01:36:52;"All my friends are idiots."
01:36:52;01:36:56;"The heathens take it slow."
01:36:56;01:36:57;"OK, 21 Pilots, Heathens."
01:36:57;01:36:59;"We're not going to listen to it, man,"
01:36:59;01:37:02;"because I've gotten some tweets that 21 Pilots fans"
01:37:02;01:37:04;"are sick of hearing you."
01:37:04;01:37:05;"Are you serious?"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"I at least saw one tweet where somebody said,"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"I'm sick of hearing Jake trash my favorite band."
01:37:09;01:37:10;"Trash the band."
01:37:10;01:37:11;"OK, here's a question."
01:37:11;01:37:14;"Let's frame it in a slightly less negative way."
01:37:14;01:37:16;"It sounds like you dislike the Chainsmokers"
01:37:16;01:37:17;"more than you dislike 21 Pilots."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"Yeah."
01:37:18;01:37:19;"Big time."
01:37:19;01:37:20;"Yeah."
01:37:20;01:37:22;"You found things to like about 21 Pilots in the past."
01:37:22;01:37:26;"Yeah, I would rather see 21 Pilots in concert"
01:37:26;01:37:27;"than Chainsmokers."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"All right."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"Playing like a hometown gig in Columbus,"
01:37:31;01:37:32;"that would be interesting."
01:37:32;01:37:33;"Oh, that'd be sick."
01:37:33;01:37:33;"Yeah."
01:37:33;01:37:35;"They're playing arenas now, man."
01:37:35;01:37:39;"Well, play the AAA minor league baseball stadium"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"in Columbus."
01:37:41;01:37:42;"Columbus Clippers."
01:37:42;01:37:45;"The number four song is The Weeknd featuring Daft Punk."
01:37:45;01:37:47;"Do you remember this one, Starboy?"
01:37:48;01:37:51;"There's a starboy."
01:37:51;01:37:52;"Wrong song."
01:37:52;01:37:56;"Foreboding."
01:37:56;01:38:03;"I'm trying to put you in the worst mood."
01:38:03;01:38:06;"I'll be one greener than your church shoes."
01:38:06;01:38:08;"I'll belly point to just to hurt you."
01:38:08;01:38:10;"You like it?"
01:38:10;01:38:11;"Yeah, it's cool."
01:38:11;01:38:13;"None of these toys onlys to."
01:38:13;01:38:16;"I made your whole year in a week to."
01:38:16;01:38:17;"That's not The Weeknd's."
01:38:17;01:38:18;"That's The Weeknd's thing."
01:38:18;01:38:19;"Oh, really?"
01:38:19;01:38:20;"That's cool."
01:38:20;01:38:28;"Beautiful voice."
01:38:30;01:38:50;"Ooh, look what you've done."
01:38:50;01:38:52;"I like that hook."
01:38:52;01:38:53;"Oh, yeah."
01:38:53;01:38:54;"Yeah."
01:38:56;01:39:06;"Good song."
01:39:06;01:39:07;"That's tight."
01:39:07;01:39:08;"It's grown on me a lot."
01:39:08;01:39:10;"Yeah, I'm down with it."
01:39:10;01:39:13;"We are hearing a lot of the same songs in the top five."
01:39:13;01:39:17;"I understand your frustration, but we do have something new"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"at number three."
01:39:19;01:39:21;"OK."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"I assume you're familiar with Bruno Mars."
01:39:22;01:39:23;"Yeah."
01:39:23;01:39:25;"Arguably-- and I'm being serious now--"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"arguably our generation's Billy Joel."
01:39:27;01:39:29;"Consistent hit maker."
01:39:29;01:39:31;"Can do any genre."
01:39:31;01:39:32;"OK."
01:39:32;01:39:34;"I don't know why I don't know any of his songs, but--"
01:39:34;01:39:36;"Some of his early songs."
01:39:36;01:39:38;"There's one, though, something like ""You're Beautiful Just"
01:39:38;01:39:41;"the Way You Are,"" which Billy has a song like that, too."
01:39:41;01:39:44;"He had a song called ""The Lazy Song"" that went--"
01:39:44;01:39:48;"(SINGING) Today I don't feel like doing anything."
01:39:48;01:39:51;"It's a song about being lazy, more or less."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"He had that kind of police-inspired song,"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"""Box Out of Heaven."""
01:39:55;01:39:58;"There is no Billy Joel of this generation."
01:39:58;01:40:01;"He's the closest thing."
01:40:01;01:40:03;"He dances."
01:40:03;01:40:04;"Billy didn't dance."
01:40:04;01:40:05;"Yeah, it's not much."
01:40:05;01:40:08;"Well, you know, his really big song with Mark"
01:40:08;01:40:10;"was ""Uptown Funk."""
01:40:10;01:40:11;"Terrible song."
01:40:11;01:40:13;"Oh, I hate that song."
01:40:13;01:40:14;"You hate ""Uptown Funk?"""
01:40:14;01:40:15;"Oh, it's the worst."
01:40:15;01:40:17;"You know, Mark Ronson was one of the first guests"
01:40:17;01:40:18;"on this show."
01:40:18;01:40:19;"No, I don't know that."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"Who is that?"
01:40:21;01:40:22;"Wait, do you not know who Mark Ronson is?"
01:40:22;01:40:23;"No."
01:40:23;01:40:25;"You're dead ass right now."
01:40:25;01:40:26;"Yeah, I don't know who that is."
01:40:26;01:40:27;"You don't know who Mark Ronson is?"
01:40:27;01:40:28;"No."
01:40:28;01:40:31;"Who is Mark Ronson?"
01:40:31;01:40:32;"Is it his song?"
01:40:32;01:40:32;"Yes."
01:40:32;01:40:34;"Bruno was saying it, though."
01:40:34;01:40:35;"Yeah."
01:40:35;01:40:38;"Mark Ronson is a DJ and producer."
01:40:38;01:40:39;"He's very well known for producing"
01:40:39;01:40:41;"some of Amy Winehouse's hits."
01:40:41;01:40:42;"OK."
01:40:42;01:40:44;"British guy?"
01:40:44;01:40:45;"Anglo-American."
01:40:45;01:40:46;"OK."
01:40:46;01:40:47;"And then he--"
01:40:47;01:40:48;"What the--"
01:40:48;01:40:50;"He made ""Uptown Funk."""
01:40:50;01:40:52;"""Uptown Funk"" is Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars."
01:40:52;01:40:53;"Why are you shocked that I don't know that?"
01:40:53;01:40:55;"The guy that produced Amy Winehouse,"
01:40:55;01:40:57;"who then made this crappy--"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"Oh."
01:40:59;01:41:02;"Like, why is this so contentious?"
01:41:02;01:41:05;"It is like the most stale--"
01:41:05;01:41:06;"Oh."
01:41:06;01:41:07;"Wow."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"The most stale--"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"I don't even-- pop, like light pop funk."
01:41:11;01:41:14;"Jake, you know, just last week, ""Uptown Funk"" went diamond."
01:41:14;01:41:15;"You're saying--"
01:41:15;01:41:16;"It sold 10 million copies."
01:41:16;01:41:18;"You're saying the guy that produced Amy Winehouse"
01:41:18;01:41:20;"made this other song, and somehow I"
01:41:20;01:41:22;"should know who that is?"
01:41:22;01:41:23;"Yes."
01:41:23;01:41:24;"That's insane."
01:41:24;01:41:25;"An iconic producer."
01:41:25;01:41:27;"What else has he done besides Amy Winehouse?"
01:41:27;01:41:29;"He's made his own albums."
01:41:29;01:41:31;"I don't think you know any of those songs."
01:41:31;01:41:34;"""Nika Costa."""
01:41:34;01:41:36;"""Light as a Feather."""
01:41:36;01:41:37;"Drawing a blank here, bro."
01:41:37;01:41:38;"Did a A$AP Rocky song."
01:41:38;01:41:42;"All right, you're not familiar."
01:41:42;01:41:44;"I get it."
01:41:44;01:41:46;"Wait, so where were we?"
01:41:46;01:41:47;"Well, we were talking about Bruno Mars."
01:41:47;01:41:48;"Right."
01:41:48;01:41:51;"Shout out to Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson."
01:41:51;01:41:51;"Oh, yeah."
01:41:51;01:41:52;"OK."
01:41:52;01:41:54;"Not everybody in this room knows who you are,"
01:41:54;01:41:57;"but your song did go diamond."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"10 million copies."
01:41:58;01:42:00;"So that's 10 million, like, downloads."
01:42:00;01:42:01;"Singles."
01:42:01;01:42:01;"I don't know."
01:42:01;01:42:04;"It's like 8 million downloads, 2 million--"
01:42:04;01:42:06;"Because singles."
01:42:06;01:42:06;"CD singles."
01:42:06;01:42:07;"I don't know."
01:42:07;01:42:09;"OK, but so you know who Bruno Mars is?"
01:42:09;01:42:10;"Yeah, I do."
01:42:10;01:42:13;"So Bruno Mars had so much success with ""Uptown Funk,"""
01:42:13;01:42:16;"a universally beloved song."
01:42:16;01:42:18;"Present company excluded."
01:42:18;01:42:19;"You know what it's like?"
01:42:19;01:42:23;"It's like, play that funky music, white boy."
01:42:23;01:42:27;"It's like that level of just schlock crap."
01:42:27;01:42:29;"Oh."
01:42:29;01:42:31;"It's that bass."
01:42:31;01:42:34;"Man, what do you do when you go to a wedding, man?"
01:42:34;01:42:36;"And they're just playing ""Uptown Funk,"""
01:42:36;01:42:38;"play that funky music, white boy."
01:42:38;01:42:40;"And then they play ""Beast of Burden"" by the Stones,"
01:42:40;01:42:43;"and I'm there."
01:42:43;01:42:45;"I don't know what kind of cockeyed wedding"
01:42:45;01:42:48;"you're going to, or they're playing ""Beast of Burden."""
01:42:48;01:42:50;"They're playing ""Beast of Burden."""
01:42:50;01:42:51;"Maybe, miss you."
01:42:51;01:42:53;"Maybe."
01:42:53;01:42:56;"OK, so anyway, Bruno Mars is back with a single"
01:42:56;01:42:59;"that I have yet to meet a person who doesn't like this song."
01:42:59;01:42:59;"OK."
01:42:59;01:43:02;"I have a feeling I'm about to meet that person."
01:43:02;01:43:03;"It's called ""24-Karat Magic."""
01:43:03;01:43:04;"OK."
01:43:04;01:43:12;"(SINGING) Tonight, I just want to take you away."
01:43:13;01:43:16;"You're the only one who knows what's right."
01:43:16;01:43:17;"Oh, you like it better than ""Uptown Funk?"""
01:43:17;01:43:18;"Oh, my god, yeah."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"(SINGING) This party all right."
01:43:19;01:43:32;"Players, put your pinky rings up to the moon."
01:43:32;01:43:36;"Guess what y'all trying to do."
01:43:36;01:43:41;"24-karat magic in the air."
01:43:42;01:43:44;"Hands and toes so clear."
01:43:44;01:43:46;"Look out."
01:43:46;01:43:47;"Pop pop, it's showtime."
01:43:47;01:43:48;"Showtime."
01:43:49;01:43:51;"Guess who's back again."
01:43:51;01:43:52;"Oh, they don't know."
01:43:52;01:43:52;"Gone time."
01:43:52;01:43:53;"Oh, they don't know."
01:43:53;01:43:54;"Gone time."
01:43:54;01:43:55;"I bet they know as soon as we walk in."
01:43:55;01:43:56;"Showtime."
01:43:56;01:43:57;"Wearing Cuban links."
01:43:57;01:43:57;"Yeah."
01:43:57;01:43:58;"Designer mix."
01:43:58;01:43:58;"Yeah."
01:43:58;01:43:59;"Inglewood's finest shoes."
01:43:59;01:44:00;"Woo woo."
01:44:00;01:44:02;"Don't look too hard, might hurt you some."
01:44:02;01:44:04;"Known to give the color red the blues."
01:44:04;01:44:05;"Woo."
01:44:05;01:44:05;"Yes."
01:44:05;01:44:06;"Woo."
01:44:06;01:44:07;"You like that line?"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"What was the line?"
01:44:10;01:44:12;"Known to give the color red the blues."
01:44:12;01:44:14;"What does that mean to you?"
01:44:14;01:44:18;"I think it means he's so depressing that he could even"
01:44:18;01:44:20;"give the color red the blues."
01:44:20;01:44:21;"Oh."
01:44:21;01:44:22;"That's what it makes sense."
01:44:22;01:44:23;"Wait, what?"
01:44:23;01:44:25;"This is not a depressing song."
01:44:25;01:44:28;"This is like desperately playing with us to feel good."
01:44:28;01:44:29;"Look a little deeper, man."
01:44:29;01:44:35;"24-karat magic in the air."
01:44:35;01:44:37;"Hands and toes so clear."
01:44:37;01:44:39;"Love that bass."
01:44:39;01:44:41;"Second verse for the hustlers."
01:44:41;01:44:42;"Gangsters."
01:44:42;01:44:44;"Bad and your ugly ass friends."
01:44:44;01:44:45;"Okay."
01:44:45;01:44:47;"I got to point something out."
01:44:47;01:44:50;"So he's shouting out the gangsters and hustlers and then"
01:44:50;01:44:54;"he says bad bitches and your ugly ass friends."
01:44:54;01:44:58;"This is a guy whose early hit expressed the sentiment,"
01:44:58;01:45:01;"you're beautiful just the way you are."
01:45:01;01:45:03;"I'm not calling him out."
01:45:03;01:45:04;"People change."
01:45:04;01:45:08;"People evolve or devolve as lyricists, but you can"
01:45:08;01:45:11;"express conflicting viewpoints in different songs."
01:45:11;01:45:12;"That's true."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"That's what makes us human."
01:45:14;01:45:17;"But I did notice when I first watched this video and I was"
01:45:17;01:45:20;"looking at the comments, which maybe was my first mistake."
01:45:20;01:45:22;"You shouldn't look at the comments."
01:45:22;01:45:26;"But I saw somebody quote that line and they seemed to be"
01:45:26;01:45:28;"an old school Bruno Mars fan."
01:45:28;01:45:33;"And this person said bad bitches and your ugly ass friends."
01:45:33;01:45:36;"Is this really the guy who sang you're beautiful just the way"
01:45:36;01:45:37;"you are?"
01:45:37;01:45:38;"I was really disappointed."
01:45:38;01:45:39;"I could see that."
01:45:39;01:45:42;"You were like a kid, self-conscious about your"
01:45:42;01:45:43;"appearance."
01:45:43;01:45:44;"Yeah."
01:45:44;01:45:47;"What if you're somebody who's not conventionally attractive?"
01:45:47;01:45:48;"You really struggled."
01:45:48;01:45:49;"I can relate to that."
01:45:49;01:45:52;"And then you're handsome, man."
01:45:52;01:45:53;"I wasn't fishing."
01:45:53;01:45:54;"All right."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"I was not fishing."
01:45:55;01:45:59;"But I'm saying, yeah, say you're somebody that maybe gets"
01:45:59;01:46:00;"teased a lot or something."
01:46:00;01:46:01;"Yeah."
01:46:01;01:46:05;"And then this like really sweet guy from Hawaii."
01:46:05;01:46:06;"Yeah."
01:46:06;01:46:07;"You're like a scene."
01:46:07;01:46:09;"Some might even call him today's Billy Joel."
01:46:09;01:46:11;"He sings to you."
01:46:11;01:46:16;"Because you're amazing just the way you are."
01:46:16;01:46:19;"And you're like, hey, maybe I am."
01:46:19;01:46:22;"And the fact that this amazing guy from Hawaii is telling you"
01:46:22;01:46:25;"that you're OK gets you through a tough time."
01:46:25;01:46:26;"Yeah."
01:46:26;01:46:30;"Six years later, you're a little bit older, but no more"
01:46:30;01:46:32;"conventionally attractive than you were."
01:46:32;01:46:33;"Quite a bit older."
01:46:33;01:46:34;"You're still self-conscious."
01:46:34;01:46:35;"Yeah."
01:46:35;01:46:39;"And then you see that your favorite artist has a song out."
01:46:39;01:46:41;"It's called 24 Carat Magic."
01:46:41;01:46:43;"Intriguing title."
01:46:43;01:46:45;"Seems like a good time, fun song."
01:46:45;01:46:46;"Yeah."
01:46:46;01:46:47;"It's like about a diamond or something."
01:46:47;01:46:48;"Yeah."
01:46:48;01:46:49;"First verse."
01:46:49;01:46:50;"Sparkly jewelry."
01:46:50;01:46:51;"You love the intro."
01:46:51;01:46:53;"You love that funky bass."
01:46:53;01:46:54;"Yeah."
01:46:54;01:46:55;"You love the first verse."
01:46:55;01:46:57;"You love the pre-chorus."
01:46:57;01:47:00;"And you love the chorus."
01:47:00;01:47:02;"Then Bruno says second verse."
01:47:02;01:47:05;"You have no reason to expect things are going to go downhill"
01:47:05;01:47:07;"if anything will get better."
01:47:07;01:47:09;"He shouts out gangsters."
01:47:09;01:47:11;"That's cool."
01:47:11;01:47:12;"Was there an Englewood shout out?"
01:47:12;01:47:13;"Yeah, he says something about Englewood."
01:47:13;01:47:14;"I don't know why."
01:47:14;01:47:15;"Yeah."
01:47:15;01:47:17;"Englewood, Hawaii."
01:47:17;01:47:18;"He shouts out gangsters."
01:47:18;01:47:19;"So far, so good."
01:47:19;01:47:21;"I thought the red and the blues thing you mentioned"
01:47:21;01:47:23;"was maybe even like a Blood Crips thing."
01:47:23;01:47:25;"Oh, maybe."
01:47:25;01:47:27;"Maybe he's rebranding as--"
01:47:27;01:47:28;"I was like--"
01:47:28;01:47:29;"--somebody from South Central."
01:47:29;01:47:34;"It reminded me of early '90s Dr. Dre style rap."
01:47:34;01:47:37;"Really, they both have a love of that '70s, '80s funk."
01:47:37;01:47:40;"Yeah, they have similar influence."
01:47:40;01:47:42;"So anyway, you're listening to the second verse."
01:47:42;01:47:43;"Yeah, yeah."
01:47:43;01:47:44;"Shouts out the gangsters."
01:47:44;01:47:45;"Shouts out the hustlers."
01:47:45;01:47:46;"Yeah."
01:47:46;01:47:48;"Nothing wrong with gangsters or hustlers."
01:47:48;01:47:49;"We all got to make a living."
01:47:49;01:47:52;"Then he shouts out bad bitches."
01:47:52;01:47:53;"Cool."
01:47:53;01:47:56;"Yeah, bad bitches is a positive thing."
01:47:56;01:47:58;"Unless you really have a problem with the word bitch,"
01:47:58;01:48:01;"which increasingly people don't in that usage."
01:48:01;01:48:02;"So you're loving it."
01:48:02;01:48:04;"You're loving the second verse so far."
01:48:04;01:48:05;"And then he tacks a little something"
01:48:05;01:48:07;"onto the bad bitches."
01:48:07;01:48:10;"And you're ugly ass friends."
01:48:10;01:48:11;"Cold."
01:48:11;01:48:12;"It's cold."
01:48:12;01:48:14;"And maybe you're somebody who, when you go out"
01:48:14;01:48:17;"with your friends, there's one that gets a lot of attention."
01:48:17;01:48:19;"And you've even had some jerk."
01:48:19;01:48:20;"I hate that."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"I'm ruining the song for you, aren't I?"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"No, I hate seeing that dynamic."
01:48:23;01:48:24;"You see a bunch of girls."
01:48:24;01:48:25;"I think there really is somebody--"
01:48:25;01:48:26;"It's rough."
01:48:26;01:48:28;"There really is somebody for everybody."
01:48:28;01:48:29;"Sure, absolutely."
01:48:29;01:48:32;"By the way, even if you're considered good looking,"
01:48:32;01:48:34;"all you have to do to become the quote, unquote,"
01:48:34;01:48:36;"""ugly person"" in the group is to go hang out"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"with a better looking person."
01:48:38;01:48:40;"We're all just a beautiful person away"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"from being the ugly friend."
01:48:42;01:48:43;"That's why I'm on this show."
01:48:43;01:48:46;"Oh, no."
01:48:46;01:48:47;"I'm saying like--"
01:48:47;01:48:48;"This is radio."
01:48:48;01:48:51;"In a certain group of people--"
01:48:51;01:48:52;"trying to think of a good--"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"like Matt Damon might be the hot one."
01:48:54;01:48:55;"Yeah."
01:48:55;01:48:56;"And in another group, he might not."
01:48:56;01:48:59;"OK, if Matt Damon's hanging out with like Mark Wahlberg,"
01:48:59;01:49:01;"Mark Wahlberg's the hot one."
01:49:01;01:49:02;"Who's hotter?"
01:49:02;01:49:03;"OK."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"Damon's got like that real thick neck."
01:49:05;01:49:06;"Brad Pitt."
01:49:06;01:49:09;"But anyway, no, but I'm being serious for a second."
01:49:09;01:49:10;"What are we even talking about?"
01:49:10;01:49:11;"But I'm being serious."
01:49:11;01:49:13;"Like when I saw that comment, it really did--"
01:49:13;01:49:14;"it really did make me feel kind of sad."
01:49:14;01:49:16;"Because like what we're talking about--"
01:49:16;01:49:19;"like sometimes on this show, we make outlandish--"
01:49:19;01:49:22;"I'm willing to admit maybe there are no Boney Bear fans"
01:49:22;01:49:25;"that stop supporting him because of his negative Pepsi"
01:49:25;01:49:26;"comments."
01:49:26;01:49:27;"Maybe I'm wrong about that."
01:49:27;01:49:28;"There might be none."
01:49:28;01:49:32;"But there are so many people, both genders--"
01:49:32;01:49:34;"of all genders, I should say--"
01:49:34;01:49:37;"who feel self-conscious about the way they look."
01:49:37;01:49:39;"There could be hundreds of thousands of people"
01:49:39;01:49:42;"for whom that you're amazing just the way you are--"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"whatever that song's called, ""Beautiful"" or something--"
01:49:44;01:49:45;"was meaningful."
01:49:45;01:49:50;"And then the ugly friends line just hurts."
01:49:50;01:49:51;"Yeah, but at the same time--"
01:49:51;01:49:53;"You still like it more than Uptown Funk, Jake?"
01:49:53;01:49:54;"Oh, yeah, absolutely."
01:49:54;01:49:55;"It's full of surprises."
01:49:55;01:49:56;"I like it."
01:49:56;01:49:58;"I mean, Uptown Funk was just like the most--"
01:49:58;01:50:00;"I don't need to talk about Uptown Funk anymore."
01:50:00;01:50:02;"It was just-- there were no surprises."
01:50:02;01:50:05;"I was like shocked how generic that song was."
01:50:05;01:50:06;"That's sad."
01:50:06;01:50:08;"But to your point on the lyrics, it's"
01:50:08;01:50:10;"sad that they wrote that YouTube comment."
01:50:10;01:50:15;"But they also can't invest too much in that song."
01:50:15;01:50:18;"And Bruno Mars should not think twice"
01:50:18;01:50:22;"about putting lyrics like that into his songs, if he wants."
01:50:22;01:50:25;"What, like from a freedom of speech angle?"
01:50:25;01:50:28;"Yeah, from-- do what he wants to do artistically."
01:50:28;01:50:31;"Not all his music should be aspirational."
01:50:31;01:50:34;"It doesn't need to be feel-good aspirational stuff."
01:50:34;01:50:37;"And if people don't like that, then that's the way it goes."
01:50:37;01:50:39;"Very Donald Trump of you."
01:50:39;01:50:41;"Freedom for the artist, man."
01:50:41;01:50:42;"Freedom for the artist."
01:50:42;01:50:43;"All right, I hear you."
01:50:43;01:50:46;"Moving on in the top five, we got Maroon 5."
01:50:46;01:50:48;"This is a new one on the charts."
01:50:48;01:50:49;"Do you like Maroon 5?"
01:50:49;01:50:50;"No."
01:50:50;01:50:51;"OK, it's featuring Kendrick Lamar."
01:50:51;01:50:52;"You like Kendrick Lamar?"
01:50:52;01:50:53;"Oh, wow."
01:50:53;01:50:54;"Yeah, I do, actually."
01:50:54;01:50:56;"That's-- OK, this is an interesting combination."
01:50:56;01:50:58;"The song's called ""Don't Wanna Know."""
01:50:58;01:51:00;"[music - ""don't wanna know""]"
01:51:00;01:51:11;"I don't wanna know, know, know, know who's taking you home,"
01:51:11;01:51:14;"home, home, home, and loving you so, so, so, so."
01:51:14;01:51:18;"Definitely keeping up with the trends of production."
01:51:18;01:51:20;"Don't wanna know, know, know, know who's taking you home,"
01:51:20;01:51:22;"home, home, home, and loving you so, so, so."
01:51:22;01:51:24;"Kind of sounds like a chain-smoker song."
01:51:24;01:51:27;"I love that first Maroon 5 single."
01:51:27;01:51:28;"Yeah."
01:51:28;01:51:30;"Reminding me of a Billy Joel song."
01:51:30;01:51:31;"""This Love""?"
01:51:31;01:51:32;"Yeah."
01:51:32;01:51:34;"Yeah, it reminded me of ""Moving Out"" a little bit."
01:51:34;01:51:36;"[music - ""moving out""]"
01:51:36;01:51:43;"This is maybe like a cooler side of Maroon 5."
01:51:43;01:51:45;"It sounds like they're working with the guy that worked"
01:51:45;01:51:47;"with Bieber the last year, too."
01:51:47;01:51:48;"Isn't that big?"
01:51:48;01:51:49;"Sort of like tropical."
01:51:49;01:51:50;"Tropical house."
01:51:50;01:51:52;"[music - ""tropical house""]"
01:51:53;01:51:56;"Better now that I'm not around."
01:51:56;01:51:58;"But things are a lot strange."
01:51:58;01:52:01;"They don't bring up your name."
01:52:01;01:52:03;"Are you happy now?"
01:52:03;01:52:04;"Are you happy now?"
01:52:04;01:52:06;"Here comes the chorus."
01:52:06;01:52:09;"I don't wanna know, know, know, know who's taking you home,"
01:52:09;01:52:13;"home, home, home, and loving you so, so, so, so."
01:52:13;01:52:16;"Who's gonna drive you home?"
01:52:16;01:52:19;"So many songs with that sentiment, ""I don't wanna know."""
01:52:19;01:52:21;"You know that Arctic Monkeys song?"
01:52:21;01:52:26;"I want to know if this feeling goes both ways."
01:52:26;01:52:27;"Sort of."
01:52:27;01:52:29;"There's a lot of things in life we don't want to know."
01:52:29;01:52:32;"I hear it from this one, hear it from that one,"
01:52:32;01:52:36;"that you got someone new."
01:52:36;01:52:39;"I say, but don't believe it."
01:52:39;01:52:42;"Deep into my head, you're still in my bed."
01:52:42;01:52:44;"Baby, I'm just a fool."
01:52:44;01:52:48;"Do you think of me, the boy we used to be?"
01:52:48;01:52:53;"Is it better now that I'm not around?"
01:52:53;01:52:58;"But things are a lot too strange to bring up your name."
01:52:58;01:53:00;"Are you happy now?"
01:53:02;01:53:06;"I don't wanna know, know, know, know who's taking you home,"
01:53:06;01:53:10;"home, home, home, and loving you so, so, so, so."
01:53:10;01:53:13;"The way I used to love you, no, I don't wanna know,"
01:53:13;01:53:16;"know, know, know who's taking you home,"
01:53:16;01:53:20;"home, home, home, and loving you so, so, so, so."
01:53:20;01:53:23;"The way I used to love you, oh, I don't wanna know."
01:53:23;01:53:24;"No more please stop."
01:53:24;01:53:27;"No more hashtag bulled up screenshots."
01:53:27;01:53:29;"No more trying to make me jealous on your birthday."
01:53:29;01:53:31;"You know just how I make it better on your birthday."
01:53:31;01:53:33;"Oh, do we do you like this?"
01:53:33;01:53:34;"Do we, will you like this?"
01:53:34;01:53:36;"Do we let down for you 'cause you, you like this?"
01:53:36;01:53:38;"Matter of fact, never mind."
01:53:38;01:53:39;"We're gonna let the past be."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"Maybe he is right now, but your body still--"
01:53:41;01:53:42;"I don't wanna know."
01:53:42;01:53:43;"That was a short verse."
01:53:43;01:53:44;"Yeah."
01:53:44;01:53:46;"He got in."
01:53:46;01:53:49;"He emailed his verse over."
01:53:49;01:53:53;"Hey Kendrick, you wanna do a verse for Maroon 5?"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"Not really."
01:53:55;01:53:57;"(laughing)"
01:53:57;01:53:59;"Well, let me talk you into it."
01:53:59;01:54:01;"The Taylor Swift one worked out."
01:54:01;01:54:03;"It can be a short verse."
01:54:03;01:54:05;"Did he do a verse for Taylor Swift?"
01:54:05;01:54:08;"Yeah, remember on Bad Blood remix?"
01:54:08;01:54:09;"Okay, here's the thing, dude."
01:54:09;01:54:12;"If it's not in the top five, I don't know about it."
01:54:12;01:54:13;"It wasn't, maybe you weren't,"
01:54:13;01:54:15;"maybe those shows were in New York, I don't remember."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"All right."
01:54:17;01:54:21;"The number one song going out to Jake Longstreth"
01:54:21;01:54:24;"in Los Angeles is by a group out of New York"
01:54:24;01:54:28;"called The Chainsmokers, featuring Halsey."
01:54:28;01:54:29;"Closer."
01:54:29;01:54:31;"Who's Halsey?"
01:54:31;01:54:34;"Halsey is a singer."
01:54:34;01:54:37;"She put out her debut album like a year or two ago"
01:54:37;01:54:39;"from New Jersey."
01:54:39;01:54:40;"♪ Hey ♪"
01:54:40;01:54:43;"Wow, this song, it's still the same song."
01:54:43;01:54:49;"This song is the Like a Rolling Stone of 2016."
01:54:49;01:54:52;"When we look back at this election,"
01:54:52;01:54:56;"2016, America was right on the edge."
01:54:56;01:55:01;"We all know this song."
01:55:01;01:55:03;"Like a Rolling Stone."
01:55:03;01:55:06;"Chainsmokers, do not bother me."
01:55:06;01:55:08;"Does your conscience bother you?"
01:55:08;01:55:12;"That is a lukewarm endorsement."
01:55:12;01:55:16;"I mean, that's a catchy song."
01:55:16;01:55:17;"Apparently there's been some beef."
01:55:17;01:55:18;"What's the beef?"
01:55:18;01:55:19;"Fill me in."
01:55:19;01:55:20;"I don't actually know what the beef is."
01:55:20;01:55:21;"Who's the beef with?"
01:55:21;01:55:23;"I think I don't want to know."
01:55:23;01:55:25;"Maroon 5, what the beef is."
01:55:25;01:55:27;"Somebody in the room, give us the beef real quick."
01:55:27;01:55:28;"You want to know, dude."
01:55:28;01:55:30;"We got to get Seinfeld 2000 on the mic for a second."
01:55:30;01:55:32;"I want Seinfeld 2000 to explain the beef."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"Jason, jump in."
01:55:33;01:55:36;"Okay, so I'm just finding out about this myself right now."
01:55:36;01:55:39;"But basically, Chainsmokers were not--"
01:55:39;01:55:40;"Wait, you mean they weren't talking about this"
01:55:40;01:55:43;"on the Seinfeld fan message boards?"
01:55:43;01:55:44;"All right, Ezra."
01:55:44;01:55:47;"You bring me on the mic, and then you just persecute me."
01:55:47;01:55:48;"I'm not persecuting you, man."
01:55:48;01:55:49;"All right."
01:55:49;01:55:50;"All right, well--"
01:55:50;01:55:51;"What's going on?"
01:55:51;01:55:53;"Apparently Chainsmokers did not mince words."
01:55:53;01:55:56;"They said some things about Lady Gaga's single"
01:55:56;01:55:58;"""Perfect Illusion."""
01:55:58;01:55:59;"Okay?"
01:55:59;01:56:01;"There was a Rolling Stone article where Alex Paul"
01:56:01;01:56:04;"proclaimed, and I quote, ""It sucks"""
01:56:04;01:56:06;"when talking about the song."
01:56:06;01:56:09;"And then Drew Taggart, the other Chainsmoker,"
01:56:09;01:56:10;"came through and just said, you know,"
01:56:10;01:56:11;"""She's a great artist."""
01:56:11;01:56:13;"You know, he stayed out of it."
01:56:13;01:56:17;"And then it looks like when Gaga--"
01:56:17;01:56:19;"you know, when she put out the song,"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"she tagged the Chainsmokers."
01:56:21;01:56:24;"And the new song being ""A-Yo,"""
01:56:24;01:56:26;"the follow-up to ""Perfect Illusion,"""
01:56:26;01:56:30;"she tweeted, ""#Ayo @TheChainsmokers,"
01:56:30;01:56:34;"maybe you guys'll like this one better,"""
01:56:34;01:56:37;"in a peace sign cigarette emoji."
01:56:37;01:56:38;"And then all hell broke loose."
01:56:38;01:56:39;"No, it didn't, actually."
01:56:39;01:56:40;"They got the message, and they just said,"
01:56:40;01:56:42;"""Ha-ha, Lady Gaga, respect."""
01:56:42;01:56:43;"So it's very--"
01:56:43;01:56:44;"Okay, that's not such bad beef."
01:56:44;01:56:46;"Very gentle beef, really."
01:56:46;01:56:47;"That's a very gentle beef."
01:56:47;01:56:48;"It's not even a beef."
01:56:48;01:56:51;"It's more--it's pork, or anything."
01:56:51;01:56:53;"That's--yeah, that's some pork."
01:56:53;01:56:54;"Chicken."
01:56:54;01:56:56;"All right, thank you, Seinfeld 2000."
01:56:56;01:56:57;"Also, I think one--"
01:56:57;01:56:58;"So, Jake, that's what happens"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"when you tell somebody that their song sucks."
01:57:00;01:57:02;"What a waste of time."
01:57:02;01:57:03;"What?"
01:57:03;01:57:05;"That whole beef segment."
01:57:05;01:57:06;"Beef."
01:57:06;01:57:09;"People should be able to say what they think,"
01:57:09;01:57:10;"and people should not flip out."
01:57:10;01:57:11;"But it's good."
01:57:11;01:57:12;"She didn't flip out."
01:57:12;01:57:13;"She handled it like a champ."
01:57:13;01:57:14;"Yeah."
01:57:14;01:57:15;"All respect."
01:57:15;01:57:18;"The Chainsmokers have no legs to stand on"
01:57:18;01:57:21;"to be throwing shade at, like, huge pop stars."
01:57:21;01:57:22;"They don't."
01:57:22;01:57:24;"Shots fired."
01:57:24;01:57:26;"Looks like the beef just got reignited."
01:57:26;01:57:27;"Jake Longstrap--"
01:57:27;01:57:28;"Come at me, Chainsmokers."
01:57:28;01:57:30;"Come at me!"
01:57:30;01:57:31;"Boo!"
01:57:31;01:57:32;"Well, that's the top five."
01:57:32;01:57:35;"I think this really was one for the books."
01:57:35;01:57:36;"Wait, is that what people say?"
01:57:36;01:57:37;"One for the books?"
01:57:37;01:57:38;"Yeah."
01:57:38;01:57:40;"There's got to be a better way to say it."
01:57:40;01:57:41;"One for the--"
01:57:41;01:57:42;"One for the record?"
01:57:42;01:57:43;"No."
01:57:43;01:57:44;"One for the record?"
01:57:44;01:57:46;"One for posterity?"
01:57:46;01:57:47;"No."
01:57:47;01:57:49;"This show was one for posterity."
01:57:49;01:57:50;"This show will go down in history."
01:57:50;01:57:52;"That's a super chill expression."
01:57:52;01:57:54;"We really covered a lot, man."
01:57:54;01:57:58;"We covered old dudes, snack foods."
01:57:58;01:58:00;"Little by little on this show,"
01:58:00;01:58:02;"I think we're starting to understand"
01:58:02;01:58:03;"the way the world works."
01:58:03;01:58:04;"Chippin' away."
01:58:04;01:58:06;"Chippin' away very slowly."
01:58:06;01:58:08;"Thank you for joining me, as always."
01:58:08;01:58:09;"Of course."
01:58:09;01:58:10;"Everybody listening at home,"
01:58:10;01:58:12;"keep those emails coming."
01:58:12;01:58:14;"We appreciate it."
01:58:14;01:58:15;"It doesn't just have to be"
01:58:15;01:58:18;"about corporate history and classic rock,"
01:58:18;01:58:19;"although--"
01:58:19;01:58:21;"I prefer classic rock emails."
01:58:21;01:58:22;"Jake prefers it, so."
01:58:22;01:58:24;"We'll be back in two weeks"
01:58:24;01:58:27;"on the eve of the presidential election."
01:58:27;01:58:31;"That'll be Sunday, November 6th, I think."
01:58:31;01:58:33;"Yeah, two days before the election, so--"
01:58:33;01:58:34;"Geez, Louise."
01:58:34;01:58:35;"We'll have to talk about it."
01:58:35;01:58:36;"Right now, I think--"
01:58:36;01:58:37;"That's gonna be stressful."
01:58:37;01:58:38;"I think Donald Trump has,"
01:58:38;01:58:39;"according to the New York Times,"
01:58:39;01:58:41;"which, to be fair, is a liberal--"
01:58:41;01:58:43;"The failing New York Times."
01:58:43;01:58:45;"The failing liberal newspaper"
01:58:45;01:58:46;"based in New York City."
01:58:46;01:58:47;"They say that Donald Trump"
01:58:47;01:58:49;"has a 9% chance of winning."
01:58:49;01:58:50;"Well, thank God."
01:58:50;01:58:51;"So you're saying there's a chance."
01:58:51;01:58:53;"So whatever, we'll talk about the election."
01:58:53;01:58:54;"Probably a little bit more"
01:58:54;01:58:56;"about the Frito-Lay Corporation."
01:58:56;01:58:57;"We'll see."
01:58:57;01:58:59;"Anyway, thanks for listening, guys."
01:58:59;01:59:01;"This really was an important episode."
01:59:01;01:59:03;"If I do say so myself,"
01:59:03;01:59:04;"I will see you in two weeks."
01:59:04;01:59:06;"Beats 1. Worldwide. Always on."
