00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:07;"Here in the middle of a long hot summer."
00:07;00:11;"On this episode, we talk Nickelback"
00:11;00:17;"and their beautiful complicated legacy, Elvis Costello,"
00:17;00:21;"as well as new music from Shaboozie."
00:21;00:24;"This is a July--"
00:24;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:30;00:35;"[MUSIC - EZRA KOENIG, ""TIME CRISIS""]"
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:41;00:48;"They were a felt lovingly, all my rightful chances."
00:48;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:55;00:59;"And so I dealt to the blow."
00:59;01:02;"One of us had to go."
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:07;01:10;"One of us is crying."
01:10;01:13;"One of us is lying."
01:13;01:17;"Leave the lonely man."
01:17;01:19;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:19;01:20;"And guess what?"
01:20;01:22;"There's been a run on the banks."
01:22;01:25;"The banks are all cleaned out."
01:25;01:29;"Bonnie and Clyde came through and emptied out all the banks"
01:29;01:32;"because we ran out of banked episodes."
01:32;01:34;"So the boys are semi-live."
01:34;01:36;"Farmer's Market Fresh, folks."
01:36;01:44;"This is a piping hot summer episode recorded"
01:44;01:45;"in the dog days of summer."
01:45;01:48;"You're hearing it in July."
01:48;01:50;"We're not that far off in July."
01:50;01:54;"Do you guys remember what any of the banked episodes were about?"
01:54;01:57;"2000s, right?"
01:57;01:58;"The songs of the early 2000s."
01:58;01:59;"But we didn't actually get to that."
01:59;02:01;"Yeah, we never quite got to it."
02:01;02:02;"We never quite got to it."
02:02;02:05;"But we wanted to."
02:05;02:08;"We took a trip down memory lane, I remember,"
02:08;02:10;"and talked about our earlier lives."
02:10;02:13;"And then another episode, we went deep on Aerosmith."
02:13;02:14;"And then another episode, we went--"
02:14;02:16;"we had Stephen Heiden."
02:16;02:17;"That's right."
02:17;02:20;"So I'm just hitting you with the bullet points there."
02:20;02:21;"We talk broad strokes."
02:21;02:22;"A little bit of Springsteen."
02:22;02:23;"Yep."
02:23;02:26;"All right, well, we tried to talk about the 2000s."
02:26;02:28;"The universe didn't want us to."
02:28;02:29;"Yeah, I guess we--"
02:29;02:31;"We did our best."
02:31;02:33;"Well, let's get back to the 2020s."
02:33;02:36;"Pretty cold decade so far."
02:36;02:40;"The roaring '20s."
02:40;02:41;"Well, how's everybody?"
02:41;02:42;"Yeah, not much going on."
02:42;02:44;"Let's just dig into this new GBV record."
02:44;02:44;"Yeah."
02:44;02:46;"Nothing going on."
02:46;02:49;"Well, OK, so where are you guys, first of all?"
02:49;02:51;"We're not in the same place."
02:51;02:53;"I'm in LA."
02:53;02:53;"Jake's in LA."
02:53;02:55;"Nick's in LA."
02:55;02:56;"Seinfeld's at his day job."
02:56;02:58;"He might jump in later."
02:58;02:59;"I'm in New York."
02:59;03:05;"I'm in the Apple Studios, New York City."
03:05;03:06;"Big Apple."
03:06;03:08;"This is what happens sometimes in the summer."
03:08;03:13;"I go from tour with the band to family tour"
03:13;03:15;"and back to tour with the band."
03:15;03:17;"So you don't go home and put your feet up and kick it"
03:17;03:19;"at home."
03:19;03:21;"It just hasn't worked out that way this year."
03:21;03:26;"But it means that I've been in so many places."
03:26;03:29;"For a guy whose passion is chilling."
03:29;03:30;"I know."
03:30;03:32;"That's rough."
03:32;03:36;"Yeah, well, that's why I need a really deep inner reservoir"
03:36;03:41;"of chill, because I've laid my head so many places."
03:41;03:43;"Papa was a Rolling Stone."
03:43;03:45;"Yeah, I mean, that's just classic."
03:45;03:49;"Sometimes within one week, you're in Bonner, Montana,"
03:49;03:52;"and then you're in Glastonbury."
03:52;03:55;"I was actually at the festival for three hours."
03:55;03:59;"I saw LCD sound system and Dua Lipa."
03:59;04:01;"That was a vibe."
04:01;04:04;"Right, and you were texting me that you were standing near Noel Gallagher."
04:04;04:05;"Yes."
04:05;04:09;"Noel Gallagher was watching LCD sound system side stage."
04:09;04:12;"So we were in the same little viewing area."
04:12;04:13;"And I clocked him."
04:13;04:15;"I mean, it was an all-star viewing area."
04:15;04:18;"Dave Grohl, very nice guy."
04:18;04:22;"But I saw Noel, and I said, I have a memory that I met him once."
04:22;04:26;"And I'm a huge fan."
04:26;04:29;"I don't know if the fact that I worked with his brother"
04:29;04:30;"would work against me."
04:30;04:32;"But he probably doesn't even know that."
04:32;04:36;"But anyway, in my head, I thought, there's Noel Gallagher."
04:36;04:40;"I'm not going to beeline it over to him when he's enjoying the LCD set."
04:40;04:41;"But who knows?"
04:41;04:44;"Maybe he'll be chilling backstage afterwards."
04:44;04:48;"And maybe somebody will introduce me, or the moment will feel right."
04:48;04:50;"And I'll say, hey, Noel, what's up?"
04:50;04:50;"I'm Ezra."
04:50;04:52;"I'm in this band, Vampire Weekend."
04:52;04:55;"We actually met a long time ago."
04:55;04:56;"Anyway, you know what's funny?"
04:56;04:59;"I've been wanting to ask you, do you know the band Guided by Voices?"
04:59;05:01;"I really was like, that's what I'm going to say."
05:01;05:04;"Only a few weeks earlier, Jake had been speculating."
05:04;05:07;"And I think this is a speculation you've done for years."
05:07;05:12;"What would Noel Gallagher say if asked, are you a GBV fan?"
05:12;05:14;"Or do you know the band?"
05:14;05:16;"Right, I had done a Twitter poll a while ago,"
05:16;05:18;"like, what do you think his thoughts are?"
05:18;05:19;"And there were three options."
05:19;05:23;"One was, they're bloody brilliant."
05:23;05:26;"Number two is, they're absolute [BLEEP].."
05:26;05:29;"And number three is, and I think this is the most likely,"
05:29;05:30;"never heard of them."
05:30;05:31;"Yeah."
05:31;05:34;"Or has heard of them, has not listened."
05:34;05:37;"Well, I think we once did an episode where we just speculated"
05:37;05:42;"that Noel probably just doesn't care that much about American music."
05:42;05:43;"Right."
05:43;05:45;"Which is partially what makes him cool."
05:45;05:49;"He obviously knows a ton about music."
05:49;05:50;"I can't tell."
05:50;05:51;"It kind of seems wrong."
05:51;05:53;"The dude knows so much about music."
05:53;05:56;"He's obviously such a fan of music that there's"
05:56;06:03;"no way he's not fairly aware of the history of American rock and roll."
06:03;06:08;"But then by the same token, there is such a proudly British thing"
06:08;06:09;"about Oasis."
06:09;06:10;"[MUSIC - OASIS, ""HELLO CROWD""]"
06:10;06:17;"Easy now, heavy is the head that wears a hollow crown."
06:17;06:20;"There must be something in the air."
06:20;06:24;"There's talk of revolution here."
06:24;06:25;"Talk about the clouds."
06:25;06:39;"Rainy eyes, always be prepared to see through everybody's lies."
06:39;06:41;"Soon your future will appear."
06:41;06:45;"There's nothing left for you to fear."
06:45;06:50;"I start to say a prayer for everybody there."
06:50;06:55;"Your destination comes without a fail."
06:55;07:03;"Now I saw you up and down the lane, but I don't know your name."
07:03;07:10;"All the places that you have, it makes me ashamed."
07:10;07:16;"All the love you ever made, by what you gave away,"
07:16;07:21;"but I wonder what you find."
07:21;07:27;"Yeah, so I actually Googled it, and I ended up on the Oasis Reddit."
07:27;07:29;"And someone three years ago--"
07:29;07:32;"and I've thought a lot of these thoughts before, and I like Oasis."
07:32;07:36;"Someone really made a compelling case, any GBV fans out there."
07:36;07:39;"I've always been surprised that there haven't been more comparisons"
07:39;07:42;"between ""Guarded by Voices"" and Noel Gallagher,"
07:42;07:45;"both obsessive record collectors of British and American rock"
07:45;07:47;"music from the '60s and '70s."
07:47;07:49;"Both write songs that are basically putting"
07:49;07:52;"the entire record collections in a blender and seeing what happens."
07:52;07:56;"Both proudly work in class from unglamorous places--"
07:56;07:59;"Burnage, Lanx, and Dayton, Ohio."
07:59;08:02;"Both worked for a living before becoming rock stars."
08:02;08:07;"Both very much subscribe to the cigarettes plus alcohol plus rock"
08:07;08:08;"music mantra."
08:08;08:11;"Both have a ridiculous gift for melody."
08:11;08:13;"Both put less importance on the meaning of lyrics"
08:13;08:15;"than the way the words sound."
08:15;08:19;"Both put out masterpieces in 1994 and followed up"
08:19;08:22;"with masterpieces in '95."
08:22;08:25;"Both have a certain similar attitude towards production--"
08:25;08:27;"certainly Noel in '94."
08:27;08:32;"Minimal bass, big chords, focus on vocal, blah, blah, blah."
08:32;08:36;"Both put on incredibly drunken sing-along messes of live shows."
08:36;08:37;"A lot of crossover."
08:37;08:38;"I could see it."
08:38;08:40;"I mean, yeah, maybe--"
08:40;08:41;"how could he not know?"
08:41;08:45;"He must have heard the name at some point."
08:45;08:45;"Yeah."
08:45;08:50;"And if there was any American indie rock band that he might be into,"
08:50;08:51;"it would be them."
08:51;08:54;"Kind of hard for me to picture him wrapping his head around pavement."
08:54;08:57;"I could see him sort of dismissively being like,"
08:57;08:59;"oh, this is laconic slacker music."
08:59;09:00;"They're-- you know."
09:00;09:01;"Yeah, and then he hears GBV."
09:01;09:04;"He's like, yeah, it's a bit rock and roll, isn't it?"
09:04;09:09;"I could see him being dismissive of pavement and hating Sonic Youth."
09:09;09:11;"Oh, yeah."
09:11;09:14;"Yeah, because I feel like he could barely tolerate Radiohead."
09:14;09:15;"Oh, yeah, he hated Radiohead."
09:15;09:16;"Yeah."
09:16;09:17;"I could see Sonic Youth just--"
09:17;09:24;"he would just see it as so pretentious, artsy, like, what is this [BLEEP]??"
09:24;09:28;"I've been looking up, trying to find if Noel in the past"
09:28;09:31;"had said anything about LCD sound system."
09:31;09:32;"I was just looking it up."
09:32;09:36;"And every time I looked it up, the number one thing that comes up"
09:36;09:39;"is obviously that he was in Glass and very watching."
09:39;09:41;"But all of the articles go, Noel Gallagher"
09:41;09:44;"has zero interest in Dave Grohl."
09:44;09:46;"Oh, boy."
09:46;09:46;"That was his big--"
09:46;09:49;"I think they were both backstage at LCD."
09:49;09:52;"No, no, I was standing within five feet of each of them."
09:52;09:53;"Eyewitness here, folks."
09:53;09:54;"Yes, they were together."
09:54;09:58;"I could have done a Bob Marley, bring the two rival political factions"
09:58;10:01;"together, take both their hands, hold them up."
10:01;10:03;"Come on, Noel, be interested in him."
10:03;10:04;"At a certain point, every--"
10:04;10:07;"you know, these, like, legendary rich dude rock stars"
10:07;10:10;"are all kind of on the same circuit."
10:10;10:13;"So maybe Dave is just like, whatever."
10:13;10:14;"You were part of this--"
10:14;10:15;"this is real."
10:15;10:16;"This is a quote."
10:16;10:18;"""I did actually bump into Dave,"" Noel said."
10:18;10:22;"He was about three feet away from me when I was watching LCD sound system."
10:22;10:24;"Oh, oh, he talked about it."
10:24;10:27;"No, he goes-- and he was staying in the same hotel I was in."
10:27;10:29;"I haven't got [BLEEP] all to say to him."
10:29;10:33;"OK."
10:33;10:35;"Just keeping it a little too real in the press."
10:35;10:39;"I got zero interest in talking to him."
10:39;10:42;"Well, you know who did have something to say to you, Noel?"
10:42;10:45;"Me, Ezra."
10:45;10:48;"I had a question to ask you."
10:48;10:51;"Hey, Noel, some friends of mine have a year's long speculation"
10:51;10:58;"about your familiarity with an American indie rock band guided by voices."
10:58;11:00;"Do you have a few minutes to chat?"
11:00;11:03;"Yeah, maybe he would have been like, now this is the type of chat"
11:03;11:04;"I'm talking about."
11:04;11:07;"Dave Grohl comes up, I got [BLEEP] all to say to him."
11:07;11:14;"But you, you're bringing real, substantive conversation, mate."
11:14;11:16;"This is why I come to music festivals."
11:16;11:18;"[MUSIC - DAVE GROHL, ""I'VE WAITED TOO LONG""]"
11:18;11:22;"I've waited too long to have you right in the back of me."
11:22;11:24;"I've waited too long."
11:24;11:28;"I wonder how you keep track of me."
11:28;11:32;"You could never be strong."
11:32;11:35;"You could not make me free."
11:35;11:42;"And I'd never ask for the truth, but you have lied to me."
11:42;11:46;"Maybe I should have asked Dave Grohl about guided by voices."
11:46;11:48;"That would have been interesting, too, actually."
11:48;11:50;"Oh, yeah, man."
11:50;11:51;"That one's easier to picture."
11:51;11:52;"There's less of a question mark."
11:52;11:54;"He'd be like, oh, yeah, of course."
11:54;11:55;"Some good tunes, man."
11:55;11:55;"Yeah."
11:55;11:58;"He would know the name of a couple of records, and yeah."
11:58;11:59;"Yeah."
11:59;12:01;"OK, here, I got the quote."
12:01;12:04;"I have this feeling before this quote I'm about to read you"
12:04;12:08;"that really what matters for Noel is popularity, right?"
12:08;12:10;"He cares about what cuts through."
12:10;12:13;"So I could see him being like, well, however, who gives a shit?"
12:13;12:14;"They're not popular."
12:14;12:20;"And then in the Mercury Sun out of Portland in--"
12:20;12:21;"Just the Portland Mercury."
12:21;12:26;"Yeah, the Portland Mercury 2012."
12:26;12:27;"Here's a quote."
12:27;12:28;"Because that's what counts."
12:28;12:30;"Popular culture is what counts."
12:30;12:33;"Anything else is just who wants to be a cult band."
12:33;12:34;"Fuck that."
12:34;12:35;"You know what I mean?"
12:35;12:37;"There are thousands of great records written every day"
12:37;12:38;"that nobody owns."
12:38;12:40;"I still think band should aim to be the Beatles, not fucking,"
12:40;12:42;"I don't know, pavement."
12:42;12:43;"Wait, that's what he said?"
12:43;12:44;"Yes."
12:44;12:45;"Noel?"
12:45;12:46;"Yes."
12:46;12:46;"Wow."
12:46;12:47;"All right, well, then, yeah."
12:47;12:50;"If you're indie, he's not interested."
12:50;12:56;"Just a Stephen Malek-mas living his quiet life in Portland,"
12:56;13:03;"a revered indie rock star in the most indie rock city in America,"
13:03;13:08;"just waking up with his local paper on Sunday on his home turf."
13:08;13:12;"Last thing he's thinking about is fucking Oasis."
13:12;13:14;"Oh, Noel Gallagher."
13:14;13:16;"God, shots fired."
13:16;13:17;"What's he got to say?"
13:17;13:18;"Ouch."
13:18;13:19;"That's really lame of Noel."
13:19;13:21;"I mean, come on, man."
13:21;13:25;"Like, don't you remember when you were a young obscure band?"
13:25;13:25;"I don't know."
13:25;13:27;"Maybe Oasis wasn't ever obscure."
13:27;13:28;"Maybe they just came out of the--"
13:28;13:29;"Here's another great quote."
13:29;13:33;"My battleground is the charts, and guitar music at the top of the charts"
13:33;13:36;"is virtually non-existent unless you fucking count Green Day,"
13:36;13:39;"which nobody should."
13:39;13:41;"Well, so then he's in a lose-lose situation."
13:41;13:42;"He can't like anything."
13:42;13:45;"He only likes music that's popular, but none of them are rock bands."
13:45;13:49;"So, like, I guess you're just listening to Stones records?"
13:49;13:51;"I mean, I'm right on."
13:51;13:52;"I guess that's the sort of situation I'm in."
13:53;13:55;"[LAUGHTER]"
13:55;13:59;"You know, like, I guess he wouldn't be him if he didn't feel that way."
13:59;14:01;"Right."
14:01;14:03;"You know, Oasis, like, one of their early singles"
14:03;14:05;"is called ""Rock and Roll Star."""
14:05;14:06;"Yeah."
14:06;14:10;"There is kind of like an understanding, like, go big or go home."
14:10;14:12;"I bet he probably practiced what he preaches up to a point."
14:12;14:14;"He has slowed down a bit."
14:14;14:16;"You know, he's just hanging out."
14:16;14:18;"Got a ton of money."
14:18;14:21;"And he's like, we're not at the top of the charts anymore."
14:21;14:22;"What's the point?"
14:22;14:23;"I just-- yeah."
14:23;14:28;"I mean, I find that ultimately a very kind of depressing worldview."
14:28;14:29;"But--"
14:29;14:29;"Well, it's also very--"
14:29;14:33;"He doesn't have like a substantive relationship with music."
14:33;14:35;"This is sort of like--"
14:35;14:38;"I mean, maybe he's just kind of like doing a self-parody to like be"
14:38;14:40;"funny and interesting in the interview."
14:40;14:44;"Yeah, there's a little bit of that classic, you know,"
14:44;14:47;"playing it up for the interview."
14:47;14:48;"I think also in--"
14:48;14:49;"For the Portland Mercury."
14:49;14:50;"For the Portland Mercury."
14:50;14:53;"It's also a very English perspective."
14:53;14:56;"And I always feel this way a little bit when I'm at Glastonbury."
14:56;14:59;"It crossed my mind where, on the one hand,"
14:59;15:02;"England is a really big country and an incredibly"
15:02;15:05;"influential and important country."
15:05;15:09;"I mean, you look at the history of England, for better and for worse,"
15:09;15:12;"you know, conquered the globe."
15:12;15:17;"The random, you know, hodgepodge language that developed in the British Isles"
15:17;15:21;"became the lingua franca of the whole world."
15:21;15:29;"You know, the England popular culture, world shaking, you know."
15:29;15:33;"The Beatles, Dua Lipa, Coldplay, you name it."
15:33;15:34;"Shakespeare."
15:34;15:36;"Shakespeare."
15:36;15:43;"So on the one hand, England feels like, in a sense, as big as America."
15:43;15:46;"But then because England is such a smaller country,"
15:46;15:48;"then you're at a thing like Glastonbury and you realize, like, yeah,"
15:48;15:53;"this is also-- there's like a local flavor as well where you're kind of like,"
15:53;15:58;"right, England, in that sense, England feels small."
15:58;16:01;"So I guess all I'm saying is it's like big and small at the same time."
16:01;16:03;"There's like a little bit of like America in it."
16:03;16:07;"Massive, just like forced to be reckoned with type country."
16:07;16:10;"Then there's a little bit of like a smaller European country"
16:10;16:14;"that has its own local celebrities, local customs, whatever."
16:14;16:18;"So I think when you're in England, sometimes I think as an artist,"
16:18;16:20;"you know, it's not a big country to cover."
16:20;16:26;"So there's more of a monoculture there where, you know,"
16:26;16:31;"an indie band can have like number ones on the charts."
16:31;16:34;"Like, you know, for instance, the English kind of post-punk band,"
16:34;16:37;"Idols, they have number one records."
16:37;16:40;"And they're like, they're going to be on your radar"
16:40;16:41;"if you remotely follow music."
16:41;16:45;"Like, whereas in America, the distance between like the spotlight"
16:45;16:48;"and everything else is so huge."
16:48;16:48;"Yeah."
16:48;16:52;"That, you know, like if you live in Ohio, I don't know,"
16:52;16:53;"you might never go to New York."
16:53;16:56;"But if you're like in a band from even like the smallest town,"
16:56;16:59;"at some point you'll rip into London and do a gig."
16:59;17:01;"So I guess all I'm saying is like there, I can understand why"
17:01;17:05;"from that English perspective, he's kind of like, listen, it's not that tough."
17:05;17:08;"Either you connect with the audience, you're big or you're not."
17:08;17:13;"Whereas in America, it's kind of like the idea of being like a dude"
17:13;17:17;"in a guitar band who's kind of like, why aren't we at the top of the charts?"
17:17;17:18;"You'd be like, what are you even talking about?"
17:18;17:21;"You know, we're like a local band from Arizona."
17:21;17:22;"It's just, it's just different."
17:22;17:24;"America is a much bigger country."
17:24;17:30;"So being a cult band in America maybe feels more dignified or something."
17:30;17:32;"You got more room."
17:32;17:35;"There's more room in the shadows in America."
17:35;17:37;"Yeah, that's well put."
17:37;17:37;"Yeah, because you're right."
17:37;17:41;"Like the Smiths had like number one records in England in like the 80s."
17:41;17:41;"Yeah."
17:41;17:47;"Oh, Superman by Laurie Anderson was number one on the UK charts in 1980 or whatever."
17:47;17:48;"That's amazing."
17:48;17:50;"Those things happen."
17:50;17:53;"In America, those things essentially never happen."
17:53;17:53;"Yeah."
17:53;17:54;"It's a, I don't know."
17:54;17:55;"Yeah."
17:55;17:58;"It's a smaller, it's a smaller place."
18:24;18:28;"Don't go far, far Watch my sleeve go far"
18:28;18:34;"Look at it go"
18:34;18:38;"Look at it go"
18:38;18:41;"Look at it go"
18:41;18:44;"Look at it go"
18:44;18:48;"Look at it go"
18:48;18:51;"Look at it go"
18:51;18:56;"Look at it go"
18:56;18:59;"One day, I'll ask him about Guided by Voices,"
18:59;19:02;"and maybe one day we'll see if we can get him on the show."
19:02;19:06;"That'd be a fun episode, just kind of pick his brain."
19:06;19:11;"The guys want to interview about Guided by Voices."
19:11;19:13;"And, you know, honestly, even if you're not a fan,"
19:13;19:18;"they'll play you a lot of music from throughout the band's career."
19:18;19:20;"You can comment in real time."
19:20;19:22;"Like, you just play him, like, one song, he's like, ""Sucks."""
19:22;19:24;"And you're like, ""Okay, well, hold on, man."
19:24;19:26;"We're just getting started."""
19:26;19:29;"Matt, throw on Gold Star for Robot Boy."
19:29;19:33;"This one, I've always thought, since I first heard it 30 years ago,"
19:33;19:35;"sounded like Oasis to me."
19:35;19:40;"If I waited for you to signify the moves that I should make"
19:40;19:44;"I'd be on the take"
19:44;19:47;"Gold Star for Robot Boy"
19:47;19:49;"That's okay"
19:49;19:53;"Gold Star for Robot Boy"
19:53;19:56;"That's sort of, like, droney and, like..."
19:56;20:00;"Bob has kind of, like, a more nasal approach on this one."
20:00;20:05;"I mean, the reason I guess I could see Noel liking GBV"
20:05;20:07;"is that it's one of the only indie bands"
20:07;20:10;"that I feel like aspirations were to be pop."
20:10;20:14;"-Yeah, right. -You know, where Pavement is trying,"
20:14;20:18;"you know, maybe not being arty, but being weird and, you know,"
20:18;20:21;"ironic and... You know what I mean?"
20:21;20:24;"There's something about this, yeah."
20:24;20:27;"They're aiming, they're shooting for it."
20:27;20:32;"Yeah, they're aiming for the stars..."
20:32;20:34;"-From the date and place. -Maybe he could appreciate that."
20:34;20:39;"Even if they didn't top the charts, he can appreciate the reach."
20:39;20:40;"Robot Boy, yeah"
20:40;20:45;"If I waited for you to signify the moves that I should make"
20:45;20:48;"-It sounds like an Oasis demo. -Right."
20:48;20:53;"But I could also just see you, Tixxure, playing this for Noel,"
20:53;20:56;"and you're just like, ""You know what, man? I just really see a parallel."""
20:56;20:58;"And he's just listening to this, and he's just like,"
20:58;20:59;"""What the f*** are you talking about?"""
20:59;21:01;"-Yeah, I can totally see that too. -I can see that too."
21:01;21:03;"-Just like... -Oh, absolutely."
21:03;21:06;"This is a raucous mess."
21:06;21:10;"-This sounds like garbage. -Do not relate."
21:10;21:13;"Put on... What was the first big single?"
21:13;21:16;"I mean, there was Rock 'n' Rollstar, there was also..."
21:16;21:19;"I'm blanking right now."
21:19;21:21;"On the first album, there's..."
21:21;21:23;"-Yeah. -""Gonna live forever."""
21:23;21:27;"-Oh, right, right, right. -""Shaker Maker."""
21:27;21:30;"""Up in the Sky."" ""Columbia Supersonic."""

23:32;23:36;"Sabrina Carpenter, ""Espresso"" is the song of the summer."
23:36;23:39;"You know, it's a catchy song."
23:39;23:42;"But you know what? Like, you can go other places"
23:42;23:44;"to hear about ""Espresso."""
23:44;23:47;"Maybe we'll talk about it later, but I think what the people want"
23:47;23:50;"from a-- a semi-live time crisis"
23:50;23:53;"is to know about our songs of the summer."
23:53;23:55;"And I don't know, maybe Sabrina Carpenter, ""Espresso"""

27:10;27:13;"""Espresso,"" and some other singles,"
27:13;27:17;"she released her album, which is called ""Short and Sweet,"""

27:20;27:23;"""Fellow gig number crunch on Sabrina Carpenter height."""

27:26;27:27;"Oh, that's a good question."

27:30;27:34;"What would you consider short?"
27:34;27:36;"5'2""?"
27:36;27:38;"5'4""?"
27:38;27:39;"4'11""."
27:39;27:40;"That's short."
27:40;27:42;"Yeah, I mean, that's--"
27:42;27:44;"I wouldn't even call 5'2"" short."
27:44;27:45;"I guess for a woman, yeah."
27:45;27:46;"4'11""."
27:46;27:47;"That's short."
27:47;27:49;"She earned the title."
27:49;27:52;"A lot of great pop stars are 4'11""."
27:52;27:54;"Kylie Minogue, I believe, is 4'11""."

27:58;27:59;"Wow."
27:59;28:04;"Yeah, not hitting 5 feet, that's short."
28:04;28:10;"It's like that number 4 in the front of your height."
28:10;28:11;"That's wild."
28:11;28:14;"Yeah, but these are some of the biggest pop stars in the world."
28:14;28:15;"I'm not knocking them."
28:15;28:17;"I'm not knocking the height."
28:17;28:19;"What's the run time on that record?"
28:19;28:20;"Well, I guess the record's actually not out yet."
28:20;28:22;"It comes out in August."
28:22;28:24;"Can anybody-- have they leaked the run time?"
28:24;28:28;"It's only 12 songs, so it's not one of those crazy, super"
28:28;28:33;"loaded pop albums with 20, 21 songs."
28:33;28:37;"They have not leaked the run time."
28:37;28:38;"But I like that."
28:38;28:39;"Short and sweet."
28:39;28:41;"Yeah, no, it's a good title."
28:41;28:44;"Well, the song ""Espresso"" is 2 minutes 55 seconds,"
28:44;28:45;"so that's short and sweet."
28:45;28:47;"I like that."
28:47;28:50;"I would have loved it if it was 1.55."
28:50;28:53;"So that's perhaps the song of the summer."
28:53;28:53;"OK."
28:53;28:56;"And I could-- it's definitely summery,"
28:56;28:58;"and it's got that slightly--"
28:58;29:00;"it's a certain type of summery vibe that's--"
29:00;29:03;"it's funny, because the song's called ""Espresso."""
29:03;29:04;"So I think it's kind of about like,"
29:04;29:08;"she's like that burst of energy that you need."
29:08;29:11;"Like, she's got that-- like, she is espresso."
29:11;29:12;"It's that-- what did she say?"
29:12;29:15;"It's that me, espresso."
29:15;29:18;"Like, she's a short shot full of caffeine."
29:18;29:22;"But the music is-- yeah, has a kind of like laconic vibe."
29:22;29:27;"It makes me think a little bit about this Style Council song."
29:27;29:29;"I always think about this song like almost every summer,"
29:29;29:31;"called ""Long Hot Summer."""
29:31;29:33;"You know, Style Council is like Paul Weller's band"
29:33;29:35;"after the jam?"
29:35;29:37;"Oh, no, I don't know this."
29:37;29:39;"So what year is this?"
29:39;29:41;"I don't know, mid--"
29:41;29:43;"'80, '84?"
29:43;29:46;"I play up my role."
29:46;29:49;"I've even been out walking."
29:49;29:51;"Tell me that it helps."
29:51;29:53;"But I know when I'm--"
29:53;29:59;"Like, that slightly laid back, slow,"
29:59;30:02;"maybe a touch sad summer energy."
30:02;30:05;"All those lonely parties,"
30:05;30:07;"had the feeling as I screamed."
30:07;30:08;"'83."
30:08;30:10;"This is '83."
30:10;30:12;"And it was."
30:12;30:18;"Mm, I wanna make stuff inside."
30:18;30:20;"So this is slower than ""Espresso,"" but--"
30:20;30:21;"Yeah."

30:24;30:26;"♪ We can't escape the truth ♪"

30:41;30:42;"♪ 'Cause I end up hurting ♪"
30:42;30:46;"Like, that's a very specific summer feeling."
30:46;30:48;"A little bit sad, a little bit slow,"
30:49;30:51;"but definitely summer somehow."
30:51;30:53;"I always think about that, and I think about,"
30:53;30:56;"of course, Lana Del Rey, ""Summertime Sadness."""
30:56;31:00;"♪ Got that summertime, summertime sadness ♪"
31:00;31:02;"Sounds like a Jonathan Richman song."

31:03;31:06;"Oh, he's got that song, ""Summertime Feeling,"" right?"
31:06;31:07;"Mm."
31:07;31:10;"Summer's a weird--"
31:10;31:13;"is a weird season because it's full of fun."
31:13;31:17;"There's a side of it that's summer fun, summer loving,"
31:17;31:19;"going down the boardwalk,"
31:19;31:24;"fun, carefree days, you know, if you're school age."
31:24;31:28;"And yet, summer's also intense, you know?"
31:28;31:33;"It's not like a beautiful spring day full of promise."
31:33;31:35;"Summer's, like, heavy."
31:35;31:36;"You can feel kind of like--"
31:36;31:39;"you know, summer is the--"
31:39;31:41;"you know, summer and winter are yin-yang."
31:41;31:43;"Like, in winter, you literally can be frozen."
31:43;31:44;"You're so cold, you can't move."
31:44;31:48;"And in summer, it can be so hot that you're also"
31:48;31:52;"kind of, like, suspended in a kind of invisible jelly."
31:52;31:56;"And things slow down."
31:56;31:59;"And it's eerie, kind of."
31:59;32:03;"Anyway, Jake, what's one of your summer gems this year?"
32:03;32:05;"Two came to mind."
32:05;32:08;"Well, we just did a GBV thing, so I'm going to--"
32:08;32:10;"so there's a new record I've been listening to a lot."
32:10;32:11;"But I'm going to skip that."
32:11;32:12;"There's a great song on there called"
32:12;32:15;"""Fictional Environment Dream,"" but we're not going to do that one."
32:15;32:17;"Because we just did some."
32:17;32:18;"I have two that come to mind."
32:18;32:22;"There's a new Little Wings album called ""High on the Glade."""
32:22;32:25;"And there's a bunch of great songs on there."
32:25;32:28;"But the one I picked was ""Handful of Earth,"" which--"
32:28;32:29;"I don't know if the--"
32:29;32:32;"sonically, this is summery."
32:32;32:33;"But you've been listening to it a lot this summer."
32:33;32:35;"But I've been listening to it a lot this summer."
32:35;32:37;"Oh, that's all that matters."
32:37;32:38;"""Handful of Earth"" from Little Wings."
32:38;32:41;"[MUSIC - LITTLE WINGS, ""HANDFUL OF EARTH""]"
32:41;32:43;"It's been on heavy rotation here, too."
32:43;32:43;"Oh, yes."
32:43;32:44;"This is brand new."
32:44;32:48;"(SINGING) Sing clover and glade, if you will."
32:48;32:52;"Harmony green as you must."
32:52;32:57;"I cried as I walked up that hill, where everything"
32:57;33:00;"had turned to dust."
33:00;33:03;"Looking back over the years."
33:03;33:05;"Going a little downward at the bar."
33:05;33:07;"(SINGING) --my shoulder as well."
33:07;33:08;"Mm-hmm."
33:08;33:10;"Flamin' Modellos just singing this."
33:10;33:11;"This has a summery to it."
33:11;33:12;"Yeah, it has like an--"
33:12;33:14;"this has an Irish drinking song to it."
33:14;33:15;"(SINGING) --well."
33:15;33:20;"Oh, handful of earth, what is it worth?"
33:20;33:24;"As life is contained by our death and our birth."
33:24;33:27;"To wake on this morning and kiss at the dawn"
33:27;33:30;"from this handful of earth that I found."
33:30;33:38;"Think heaven and song if you can."
33:38;33:42;"Music eternally sending."
33:42;33:46;"The devil turned into a man."
33:46;33:49;"And every branch started bending."
33:49;33:54;"Look at my face if you're able."
33:54;33:58;"I'm hardly blameless at all."
33:58;34:01;"Spinning my foot on the table."
34:01;34:05;"And laughing at trees when they fall."
34:06;34:09;"Handful of earth, what is it worth?"
34:09;34:13;"As life is contained by our death and our birth."
34:13;34:17;"To wake on this morning and kiss at the ground"
34:17;34:20;"from this handful of earth that I found."
34:20;34:28;"Now that I've found it at last, here"
34:28;34:32;"comes the mercury showing."
34:32;34:35;"Hiding and changing so fast."
34:35;34:39;"Chaos behind it a-towing."
34:39;34:43;"By Jove, you've got it again."
34:43;34:47;"Everything fits in a circle."
34:47;34:51;"And while there is nothing to win,"
34:51;34:55;"nothing to lose is eternal."
34:55;34:56;"Beautiful work, Kyle."
34:56;35:00;"Yeah, it's not--"
35:00;35:01;"It's a heavy song."
35:01;35:04;"It's not like some breezy--"
35:04;35:06;"Yeah, but I think that makes sense."
35:06;35:08;"Summer's a heavy season."
35:08;35:09;"There you go, yeah."
35:09;35:11;"I mean, there's another song on this record"
35:11;35:13;"that is more summery."
35:13;35:14;"Yeah, what's that one called?"
35:14;35:17;"That goes, between you and me and the coconut tree,"
35:17;35:19;"it's a jungle out there."
35:19;35:21;"There's a coconut tree, dude."
35:21;35:23;"It's called Coconut-- oh, I see it."
35:23;35:25;"Yeah, yeah."
35:25;35:27;"This is a little more summery."
35:27;35:31;"To picture this is easy."
35:32;35:37;"Although some will hardly dare."
35:37;35:41;"I thought I'd teach the world to sing,"
35:41;35:46;"but that barely seems fair."
35:46;35:50;"For what with song and ding-dong ditch"
35:50;35:57;"and ding-a-ling to pair, between you and me"
35:57;36:01;"and the coconut tree,"
36:01;36:04;"it's a jungle out there."
36:04;36:17;"A nanny child and babysitter visit an au pair"
36:17;36:26;"to weave more oil than lavender into a maiden's hair."
36:26;36:34;"Snake oil gets expensive, but the burden they will bear."
36:34;36:41;"Between you and me and the coconut tree,"
36:41;36:43;"it's a jungle out there."
36:43;36:50;"Yeah, Kyle has this, like, couple different modes."
36:50;36:54;"He's got his-- this is kind of his Uncle Kyle sing-along,"
36:54;36:56;"sweet songs, and then he's got his more, like,"
36:56;36:59;"existentially kind of headier songs,"
36:59;37:01;"like Handful of Earth."
37:01;37:04;"This could be in the opening credits to a TV show."
37:04;37:07;"[laughs]"
37:07;37:08;"Between you and me and the coconut tree,"
37:08;37:09;"it's a jungle out there."
37:09;37:11;"It's a jungle out there, man."
37:11;37:19;"Could be Jake, you and Kyle start a detective agency."
37:19;37:22;"Just two chilled-out, laid-back guys."
37:22;37:24;"It's a mystery comedy."
37:24;37:25;"It's like Lebowski."
37:25;37:27;"Yeah, it's a mystery comedy."
37:27;37:30;"Takes place in L.A."
37:30;37:33;"And this is the opening credits."
37:33;37:34;"It's a very complicated case, man."
37:34;37:37;"A lot of ins, a lot of outs."
37:37;37:38;"A lot of what-have-yous."
37:38;37:41;"It's a jungle out there."
37:41;37:45;"Um, it seems like a great album for summer."
37:45;37:47;"It's a great record."
37:47;37:48;"High on the glade."
37:48;37:50;"Yep, high on the glade, folks."
37:50;37:53;"All right, so Nick, you picked a song"
37:53;37:55;"that I think is maybe in contention"
37:55;37:58;"for song of the summer, a more mainstream one."
37:58;38:00;"Yeah, I mean, when it comes to my songs of the summer,"
38:00;38:03;"I think I'm pretty down the middle."
38:03;38:07;"Like, I stay engaged in what's being"
38:07;38:08;"played in the Ubers around me."
38:08;38:10;"OK, Noel Gallagher, settle down."
38:10;38:13;"Are you playing Espresso by Sabrina Carpenter"
38:13;38:14;"at your house?"
38:14;38:17;"No, that one kind of--"
38:17;38:19;"I mean, obviously, I'm a wearer, but didn't really"
38:19;38:21;"cross my desk."
38:21;38:25;"I think I'm probably slightly in the more country side"
38:25;38:29;"of, you know, the pop music that's being played."
38:29;38:30;"Noted Zach Bryan fan."
38:30;38:31;"Noted Zach Bryan fan."
38:31;38:33;"But I would say--"
38:33;38:35;"And as a Southerner."
38:35;38:40;"And as the resident Southern due to the time crisis,"
38:40;38:43;"I do think this Shaboosie bar song--"
38:43;38:44;"have either of you heard it?"
38:44;38:45;"No."
38:45;38:46;"I have heard it."
38:46;38:50;"So I was at Stagecoach."
38:50;38:51;"Amanda and I were at Stagecoach, which"
38:51;38:55;"is a country music festival that goes on right after Coachella."
38:55;38:57;"And he came out, and it's the first time I'd ever heard it."
38:57;39:00;"And it was not particularly--"
39:00;39:02;"it's one of those moments where it's like people there,"
39:02;39:05;"I think, know it, but it's not a popular song."
39:05;39:06;"I never heard it."
39:06;39:10;"And it was sort of immediate that this"
39:10;39:11;"is going to be a very big song."
39:11;39:15;"And I think over, I don't know, the last couple of months,"
39:15;39:18;"it became fairly enormous."
39:18;39:19;"Well, let's check it out."
39:19;39:20;"Yeah."
39:20;39:21;"Who's it by?"
39:21;39:23;"Shaboosie."
39:23;39:24;"Spell that for me."
39:24;39:28;"S-H-A-B-O-O-Z-E-Y."
39:28;39:29;"OK."
39:29;39:31;"It's called a bar song, tipsy, because it's"
39:31;39:34;"kind of based on that old rap song."
39:34;39:35;"Everybody in the club getting tipsy."
39:35;39:37;"And speaking of Oasis, we have been--"
39:37;39:39;"this is very Wonderwall."
39:39;39:42;"I think it's hitting a very similar chord."
39:42;39:45;"My baby born to work it."
39:45;39:48;"She's been telling me all night long."
39:48;39:54;"Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on."
39:54;39:57;"It's 9 to 5, ain't working."
39:57;40:00;"Why the hell do I work so hard?"
40:00;40:03;"I can't worry about my problems."
40:03;40:06;"I can't take them when I'm grown."
40:06;40:10;"One, here comes the two to the three to the four."
40:10;40:11;"Tell them bring another round."
40:11;40:12;"We need plenty more."
40:12;40:14;"Two stepping on the table."
40:14;40:16;"She don't need a dance floor."
40:16;40:18;"Oh my, good lord."
40:18;40:21;"Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey."
40:21;40:24;"They know me and J Dale's got a history."
40:24;40:27;"There's a party downtown near Fifth Street."
40:27;40:29;"Everybody at the bar getting tipsy."
40:29;40:35;"Everybody at the bar getting tipsy."
40:35;40:39;"I have heard this."
40:39;40:41;"Is it possible to hear it on the show?"
40:41;40:42;"Where would I have heard this?"
40:42;40:45;"Great question."
40:45;40:47;"Maybe in the car."
40:47;40:49;"Not my car."
40:49;40:54;"No, I think I think it may have been in my car when we were going to"
40:54;40:58;"when we were going to Vampire Weekend, the Hollywood Bowl."
40:58;40:59;"That might have been it."
40:59;41:04;"And my family was on a mission to find a country song that you did like."
41:04;41:06;"Right."
41:06;41:10;"This was a fun night because my wife was working that night, so she couldn't go."
41:10;41:14;"So I rolled with Nick and his wife and his 12 year old son, Max."
41:14;41:20;"We were a four top at Taylor Steakhouse in La Quinata."
41:20;41:26;"And then we were sitting in a box together, and there was a nice half hour"
41:26;41:28;"drive from the restaurant to the venue."
41:28;41:33;"And I think we probably played this for you, and you probably were fairly"
41:33;41:38;"responsive, but I know that we just couldn't get you over the hump of Zach Ryan."
41:38;41:43;"But then when we did play our other because Ezra had said, it doesn't have"
41:43;41:45;"to be from this summer, but a song you're playing a lot."
41:45;41:49;"And we've been playing this Joe Diffie song a lot."
41:49;41:51;"John Deere Green."
41:51;41:56;"And that for you, that was, I think, the most you perked up."
41:56;41:58;"That's funny."
41:58;42:01;"Trying to get Jake into modern country."
42:01;42:03;"And this is not even modern."
42:03;42:08;"I mean, Joe Diffie is sort of a, I think, 90s artist."
42:08;42:10;"I mean, probably John Deere Green."
42:10;42:11;"Let's stay on tipsy for a while."
42:11;42:13;"Let's stay on tipsy."
42:13;42:14;"This is a big modern song."
42:14;42:24;"And also, Jake, we all know you're a classic Gen X guy with a tasteful Gen Xer."
42:24;42:31;"So any tasteful Gen Xer is going to love great country music of the 50s, 60s and 70s."
42:31;42:36;"But it's time to get on board with modern country because this is the summer"
42:36;42:39;"that it became the biggest music in the world."
42:39;42:40;"Did you know that?"
42:40;42:42;"No, I didn't know that."
42:42;42:45;"In my conversations with music industry professionals, obviously, there's a thing"
42:45;42:49;"that country has been hot in a way."
42:49;42:52;"There's an artist, was it Laney?"
42:52;42:54;"Laney Wilson has a song called Country is Cool Again."
42:54;42:56;"There's just more country in the atmosphere."
42:56;42:57;"Sure."
42:57;42:58;"Beyonce made a country album."
42:58;43:00;"Country comes and goes."
43:00;43:04;"This is one of those moments where country is hot, but it's at a level we've never"
43:04;43:05;"seen before."
43:05;43:08;"This is not just like one of those eras where it's like, yeah, actually, there's"
43:08;43:10;"some more crossover hits from country lately."
43:10;43:12;"This is the first time it's ever gone global."
43:12;43:18;"And this modern kind of country pop trap, whatever, hybrid has never been bigger"
43:18;43:19;"than now."
43:19;43:23;"And this is just an example I just had talking to one of my friends who works"
43:23;43:25;"in the music industry."
43:25;43:27;"Now, we all know the name Morgan Wallen."
43:28;43:30;"He's like one of the biggest modern country artists."
43:30;43:31;"Right."
43:31;43:32;"You know, you've heard the name Jake, right?"
43:32;43:34;"At least for sure."
43:34;43:42;"So very recently, Morgan Wallen played to 50,000 people in London."
43:42;43:43;"That's funny."
43:43;43:47;"And that's and apparently there's even just there's talk about, well, Morgan"
43:47;43:51;"Wallen, maybe you could go do some arenas in Asia."
43:51;43:55;"You know, it's just like his music is becoming like global pop."
43:56;44:02;"And that's something that a guy who is that much of like a country dude, I don't"
44:02;44:03;"know if that's ever happened."
44:03;44:05;"I don't think country music."
44:05;44:07;"I mean, this is yeah."
44:07;44:10;"Country music is never as popular as it can be here."
44:10;44:13;"It's never been considered to travel well."
44:13;44:14;"Well, certainly, yeah."
44:14;44:18;"If you think about the stars of the past, like Waylon Jennings wasn't playing to"
44:18;44:20;"50,000 people in London."
44:20;44:22;"Was Garth Brooks in the 90s?"
44:22;44:24;"You know, there may have been these certain."
44:24;44:26;"Oh, well, Shania definitely."
44:26;44:29;"Shania was a global pop star for sure."
44:29;44:33;"And then there's always been places where countries appreciated."
44:33;44:37;"They play country music on the radio in the Caribbean."
44:37;44:41;"You know, there's an African country scene."
44:41;44:43;"And Australia has a country scene."
44:43;44:46;"So it's not like it's been totally US only."
44:46;44:52;"But there's something about a dude like Morgan Wallen becoming a global pop star"
44:52;44:56;"that I don't know to me is notable because he's not he's not like Kenny Chesney,"
44:56;44:59;"who is, let's say, an equivalent and is huge."
44:59;45:04;"And then in whatever early 2000s, he's playing hundreds of he's just not going"
45:04;45:07;"to go and play internationally the same way."
45:07;45:11;"It's just I think as a genre, just why is Kenny Chesney the equivalent?"
45:11;45:15;"I think Garth Brooks or Shania Twain's equivalent."
45:15;45:18;"Garth Brooks is like more clean cut or something."
45:18;45:20;"Morgan Wallen is more."
45:20;45:25;"Yeah, it's more of that Kenny Chesney energy of being like a Southern party boy."
45:25;45:27;"Lake culture."
45:27;45:30;"It's very Lake culture."
45:30;45:31;"There's just something happening."
45:31;45:36;"And again, you know, of course, you see in America, you kind of like see how,"
45:36;45:40;"you know, stagecoach feels like a big cultural moment for sure."
45:40;45:43;"But I'm just saying it's even one step beyond that in terms of some of these"
45:43;45:45;"artists being global."
45:45;45:48;"And I will say that, you know, spending some of the summer in Europe,"
45:48;45:52;"I heard this song Shaboosie on the radio in like Italy."
45:52;45:53;"Stuff like that."
45:53;45:58;"And I mean, this music is pop music, so it's not crazy, but it's it's still notable."
45:58;46:03;"This is like a big moment for the country, modern country pop hybrids."
46:03;46:06;"I just think of like the 90s or early 2000s."
46:06;46:10;"I was like, I listen to everything except country, except country."
46:10;46:13;"Now I don't listen to anything except country."
46:13;46:14;"Yeah, no."
46:14;46:17;"And I mean, to go one step further, there's even a type of person back then"
46:17;46:20;"who used to say I listen to everything except for rap and country."
46:20;46:22;"Oh, true, true."
46:22;46:25;"And especially, you know, you could you could read a lot into that."
46:25;46:28;"Maybe they're racist, maybe they're classist."
46:28;46:32;"But that was a way of just like a kind of like down the middle person being like,"
46:32;46:36;"I don't go to the extreme of rap music, nor do I go to the extreme of country music."
46:36;46:38;"I listen to Pearl Jam."
46:38;46:42;"Steve Miller's greatest hits."
46:42;46:42;"Yeah."
46:42;46:47;"I don't I don't identify with black music,"
46:47;46:49;"but I don't identify with southern white music."
46:49;46:54;"That's basically what people were saying was like, what I identify with is a kind"
46:54;47:00;"of a middle class, coastal white thing."
47:00;47:03;"Syndicated classic rock radio."
47:03;47:06;"Yeah, but but and that person."
47:06;47:09;"So not only are there people who only listen to country now,"
47:09;47:12;"they only listen to a country rap hybrid."
47:12;47:13;"Right."
47:13;47:15;"I listen to everything except for music"
47:15;47:19;"that isn't in some way a hybrid of country and rap within that world."
47:19;47:20;"I listen to everything."
47:20;47:25;"Shaboozie, Morgan Wallen, you name it."
47:25;47:27;"But I don't go too far beyond that."
47:27;47:29;"Well, one thing that we should point out,"
47:29;47:33;"I mean, I guess this might be obvious to some listeners,"
47:33;47:42;"but this Shaboozie song is a flip or a rewrite of the classic J-Kwon song,"
47:42;47:45;"a rap song from the 2000s called Tipsy."
47:45;47:46;"Do you remember the song, Jake?"
47:46;47:47;"Yeah."
47:47;47:48;"Let's listen to this."
47:48;47:50;"Ting drinking is very bad."
47:50;47:51;"What year is this?"
47:51;47:53;"Yo, I got a fake ID though."
47:53;47:55;"I'm going to say 2004."
47:55;47:56;"Yeah."
47:56;47:57;"That old."
47:57;47:58;"Yeah."
47:58;48:01;"Yeah."
48:01;48:02;"Yeah."
48:02;48:04;"One."
48:04;48:07;"Here comes the two to the three to the four."
48:07;48:10;"Everybody drunk out on the dance floor."
48:10;48:12;"Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more."
48:12;48:14;"2004."
48:14;48:14;"Good call."
48:14;48:16;"20 years old."
48:16;48:17;"Rhyme hardcore."
48:17;48:20;"Maybe because she heard that I bought out the store."
48:20;48:22;"Bottom of the ninth in the city got the score."
48:22;48:25;"If not, I got to move on to the next floor."
48:25;48:28;"Here comes the three to the two to the one."
48:28;48:29;"Homeboy tripping."
48:29;48:31;"He don't know I got a gun."
48:31;48:34;"There's also now a lot of like, when you say this,"
48:34;48:39;"there's more country rap crossover stuff happening,"
48:39;48:41;"which I think is..."
48:41;48:45;"Yeah, Morgan has a huge song with Post Malone right now."
48:45;48:48;"Yeah, but he has another one with Moneybagg Yo."
48:48;48:54;"You have Lana doing country with Quavo."
48:54;49:06;"But it's not long ago that Lil Nas X does Country Road, and it's like a..."
49:06;49:08;"You know, I was told that Rock was back."
49:09;49:13;"None of what you're saying bodes well for Rock taking back the charts, Nick."
49:13;49:14;"Were you told that?"
49:14;49:18;"I was told multiple times by people that Rock was back."
49:18;49:21;"Nickelback was the main draw at Stagecoach."
49:21;49:22;"Oh, yeah."
49:22;49:24;"Wait, so you saw Nickelback?"
49:24;49:27;"Yeah, and it was, I mean, it ripped."
49:27;49:28;"It was one of the greatest shows I've ever been to."
49:28;49:29;"I really..."
49:29;49:34;"And Nickelback is a little bit country in their own way."
49:34;49:37;"I mean, yeah, playing the power anthem."
49:37;49:39;"I mean, it was... But people were going nuts."
49:39;49:40;"Yeah, Nickelback..."
49:40;49:45;"Well, I've talked about how one time at an event,"
49:45;49:50;"I sat next to Nickelback's manager or former manager, Chief,"
49:50;49:51;"who went on to manage..."
49:51;49:53;"Oh, no, no, he worked for Nickelback,"
49:53;49:56;"and then he became Florida Georgia Line's manager."
49:56;49:58;"And I was like, ""Oh,"" and then suddenly I drew this connection."
49:58;50:00;"I was like, ""Right, Florida Georgia Line, Nickelback."
50:00;50:02;"There's like something in common."""
50:02;50:06;"And then I watched the Nickelback documentary recently."
50:06;50:07;"Did you guys?"
50:07;50:09;"No, I've been meaning to."
50:09;50:10;"It's cool."
50:10;50:12;"I mean, one thing about Nickelback is that"
50:12;50:17;"they're from a really small farm town in Canada called Hanna."
50:17;50:22;"So, you know, they're like, in a sense, they're like rural identified."
50:22;50:25;"You know, they're not from like a big city or something."
50:25;50:27;"And they definitely loved rock."
50:27;50:28;"But like, you listen to some..."
50:28;50:31;"Like, do you remember, this is a huge song they had."
50:31;50:33;"Obviously, there's ""How You Remind Me,"" which is massive."
50:33;50:36;"But do you know this one was massive from their..."
50:36;50:39;"In 2005, this song is called ""Rockstar."""

01:05:04;01:05:06;"they're in like an awkward middle ground."
01:05:06;01:05:09;"'Cause it's not like just dumb rock songs"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"like Kiss or Motley Crue."
01:05:11;01:05:14;"And it's not like sophisticated,"
01:05:14;01:05:17;"kind of legitimately heavy music like Soundgarden"
01:05:17;01:05:19;"or Alice in Chains."
01:05:19;01:05:22;"It's like a weird middle ground"
01:05:22;01:05:25;"between like 90s despairing grunge"
01:05:25;01:05:27;"and like Def Leppard."
01:05:27;01:05:28;"- They have their hard rock moments."
01:05:28;01:05:30;"This is from 2008,"
01:05:30;01:05:32;"Off Dark Horse, Burn It to the Ground."

01:05:40;01:05:43;"And then of course I spent some more time with it"
01:05:43;01:05:44;"in the days after."
01:05:44;01:05:48;"- So you were putting on Nickelback after the doc?"
01:05:48;01:05:49;"- Yeah."
01:05:49;01:05:51;"(rock music)"
01:05:51;01:06:00;"- Yeah, this is like Metallica light."
01:06:00;01:06:01;"- Yeah."
01:06:01;01:06:03;"(rock music)"
01:06:03;01:06:09;"- Well, that's what I'm kind of saying though."
01:06:09;01:06:12;"It's like, it's very middle."
01:06:12;01:06:16;"It's taking aesthetics that were once kind of extreme"
01:06:16;01:06:20;"and like it's occupying a weird middle ground."
01:06:20;01:06:22;"- Yeah."
01:06:22;01:06:25;"(rock music)"
01:06:25;01:06:30;"- Hey!"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"(rock music)"
01:06:32;01:06:39;"- You know, whatever."
01:06:39;01:06:40;"- Yeah."
01:06:40;01:06:43;"- Rock music, but you know, at a certain point,"
01:06:43;01:06:44;"every--"
01:06:44;01:06:45;"- Whatever rock music."
01:06:45;01:06:47;"- Every band is interesting, I think,"
01:06:47;01:06:50;"when they've had a long enough career"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"and you want to be like, how did they start?"
01:06:52;01:06:53;"What are the dynamics?"
01:06:53;01:06:56;"And there's stuff that even I related to a little bit"
01:06:56;01:07:01;"in the film, which is, I don't think Vampire"
01:07:01;01:07:03;"was ever hated on the level of a Nickelback,"
01:07:03;01:07:06;"but even so, I think everybody,"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"whatever amount of criticism you get,"
01:07:08;01:07:09;"you eventually get to a point where you're kind of like,"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"man, we're just doing our thing."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"And there's something that Chad says towards the end,"
01:07:13;01:07:17;"'cause of course the narrative is they work their asses off,"
01:07:17;01:07:20;"they get huge, and then it kind of curdles"
01:07:20;01:07:23;"because they become this punchline for a while,"
01:07:23;01:07:24;"even at their greatest success."
01:07:24;01:07:27;"And then it ends on a happy note where we're like,"
01:07:27;01:07:30;"you know what, man, most people actually don't hate"
01:07:30;01:07:35;"on Nickelback and increasingly you got younger artists"
01:07:35;01:07:38;"paying respect and people shouting them out."
01:07:38;01:07:40;"And Chad says something about like,"
01:07:40;01:07:43;"'cause he clearly was more wounded than the other guys"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"by some of the criticism and he says,"
01:07:45;01:07:48;"you know, I'm out there, I'm like the face of the band."
01:07:48;01:07:48;"- Yeah."
01:07:48;01:07:51;"- People are like, I'm walking down"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"through downtown Vancouver, people pull up in their car"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"and say, your band sucks."
01:07:55;01:07:58;"And I guess Nickelback may have experienced that"
01:07:58;01:07:59;"more than any other band."
01:07:59;01:08:02;"And he says, objectively, we're the most hated on band"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"in the world, and I think he's right."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"- For sure."
01:08:05;01:08:09;"- But when you get to the kind of more happy ending,"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"and he's talking about, he's like, you know what,"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"now I let that stuff roll off my back."
01:08:13;01:08:14;"And this is the part that I related to,"
01:08:14;01:08:17;"and I think maybe all artists might relate to"
01:08:17;01:08:20;"as they get older, he said, you know what,"
01:08:20;01:08:25;"these days we go out and play Nickelback music"
01:08:25;01:08:28;"to Nickelback fans, and we're not out there"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"presenting our music to the whole world"
01:08:30;01:08:34;"and trying to get people who don't wanna like us"
01:08:34;01:08:35;"to like us."
01:08:35;01:08:38;"He said that feels like a form of torture"
01:08:38;01:08:41;"for us and the audience when we're out there."
01:08:41;01:08:42;"And there is something to it, we're like,"
01:08:42;01:08:45;"you know, when you're younger or you're like"
01:08:45;01:08:48;"a band in the spotlight, you're kind of,"
01:08:48;01:08:51;"there is this feeling as if everybody's like,"
01:08:51;01:08:52;"oh, what's this new thing?"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"I'm supposed to care about it?"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"And either they're gonna say, oh, and I do, it's cool,"
01:08:56;01:08:58;"or they're gonna be like, oh, why do you think"
01:08:58;01:08:58;"I would like this?"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"This sucks."
01:09:00;01:09:02;"Whereas there's something nice about being older,"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"and that's the thing that maybe I connected to the most"
01:09:04;01:09:05;"when he said like, you know what, man,"
01:09:05;01:09:06;"we're out there playing Nickelback music"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"to Nickelback fans."
01:09:08;01:09:11;"I'm like, that's where every artist should hope to get to,"
01:09:11;01:09:12;"unless you're a complete psychopath"
01:09:12;01:09:15;"and you need everybody to care about you."
01:09:15;01:09:17;"You know, that's what everybody should want."
01:09:17;01:09:20;"I'm 40, we're out there playing Vampire Weekend music"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"to Vampire Weekend fans."
01:09:22;01:09:23;"And when you've been through enough"
01:09:23;01:09:28;"and you've seen so many sides of the music industry,"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"if you can reach it to like middle age"
01:09:30;01:09:34;"and you're playing your music to people who care about it,"
01:09:34;01:09:37;"like, and you can just be, enjoy that and be grateful for it,"
01:09:37;01:09:38;"that's as good as it gets."
01:09:38;01:09:40;"And I was like, all right, Chad, like, hell yeah."
01:09:40;01:09:42;"I'm glad you're there."
01:09:42;01:09:43;"- Yeah, that makes a lot of sense."
01:09:43;01:09:47;"I mean, yeah, it's really a story"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"of artistic perseverance."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"- Right. - Sticking with it."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"And that's interesting."
01:09:51;01:09:55;"I didn't, it makes sense to me that you would relate"
01:09:55;01:09:58;"to what Chad was saying, 'cause yeah,"
01:09:58;01:10:00;"when your first album came out,"
01:10:00;01:10:03;"not in a mainstream cultural sense,"
01:10:03;01:10:05;"but in the indie rock world,"
01:10:05;01:10:09;"Vampire Weekend was hated on hard."
01:10:09;01:10:11;"- We were the Nickelback of '08."
01:10:11;01:10:12;"- Absolutely."
01:10:12;01:10:15;"And I was like, everyone needs to calm down."
01:10:15;01:10:17;"- Yeah, I mean, I guess the difference is that like"
01:10:17;01:10:21;"our subsequent albums were better,"
01:10:21;01:10:25;"we probably won, I don't know if we won more people over,"
01:10:25;01:10:28;"like Nickelback like tripled down."
01:10:28;01:10:31;"Like, so they-- - Right, 2013."
01:10:31;01:10:32;"- You guys grew."
01:10:32;01:10:35;"- The readers of Rolling Stone named Nickelback"
01:10:35;01:10:38;"the second worst band of the '90s, I'm free."
01:10:38;01:10:42;"- I mean, even the idea of having that as a pole"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"is brutal."
01:10:44;01:10:47;"- Yeah, it was-- - '90s?"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"I didn't, okay, I thought Nickelback was 2000s, but."
01:10:49;01:10:53;"- I mean, definitely they were thriving in the 2000s."
01:10:53;01:10:57;"- Yeah. - No, Nickelback got it hard."
01:10:57;01:11:00;"But yeah, they seem like they're, you know,"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"it seems like a nicer organization,"
01:11:02;01:11:05;"they care about each other."
01:11:05;01:11:07;"- By the way, as the pendulum swings,"
01:11:07;01:11:11;"I think the last time I saw Nickelback was 10 years ago."
01:11:11;01:11:14;"And now Creed and Nickelback, I think they're kind of--"
01:11:14;01:11:17;"- Having a moment? - Whether it's semi-ironic or not,"
01:11:17;01:11:19;"it's having a genuine marriage deal."
01:11:19;01:11:22;"I think people are-- - Creed is, too?"
01:11:22;01:11:25;"- Oh, Creed's having a huge, yeah, huge moment."
01:11:25;01:11:28;"They've been opening, would he throw out that, I mean, yeah,"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"everybody like loves Creed."
01:11:30;01:11:33;"- Scott Sepp and throwing out pitches? (laughs)"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"Okay, they're back. - Actually, that is true."
01:11:35;01:11:37;"When I was in Minnesota, I went into a Walmart,"
01:11:37;01:11:42;"and I was like, ""Damn, I'm gonna get a copy of the new vinyl reissue, Shrunk Raftion."""
01:11:42;01:11:46;"- Human clay? - No, it was a Creed's greatest hits."
01:11:46;01:11:50;"- Oh, greatest hits. - Newly pressed 180-gram vinyl in the Walmart,"
01:11:50;01:11:54;"in like suburban Minnesota, and I was like, ""Damn."""
01:11:54;01:11:56;"Always mystified by the vinyl selections."
01:11:56;01:11:59;"Oh, you know, it was a Target, it wasn't a Walmart."
01:11:59;01:12:05;"I'm always mystified by like corporate shame, vinyl curation."
01:12:05;01:12:08;"- Who's their vinyl buyer?"
01:12:08;01:12:11;"- Yeah, I was like, ""Greatest hits?"""
01:12:11;01:12:13;"They have like two hits. They had,"
01:12:13;01:12:16;"♪ Let's go there, let's make a mistake ♪"
01:12:16;01:12:19;"And then, maybe there was one other one."
01:12:19;01:12:22;"- So you bought it, and you're like--"
01:12:22;01:12:25;"- Yeah, guys-- - Greatest hits, I only know two."
01:12:25;01:12:28;"I'm gonna buy this, get it on the stereo."
01:12:28;01:12:31;"- Huge TC, huge TC news. - Yeah?"
01:12:31;01:12:34;"- Scott Stapp will play Frank Sinatra in the Ronald Reagan biopic."
01:12:34;01:12:37;"- Oh! - That rules."
01:12:37;01:12:39;"- Who's playing Ronald Reagan?"
01:12:39;01:12:42;"- I'm pretty sure it's Dennis Quaid, let me see."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"I have seen this trailer."
01:12:44;01:12:47;"- Is this a loving portrait? - Yes."
01:12:47;01:12:51;"- Oh, it's been made, it's been shot. - Yes, I've seen, yeah, yeah."
01:12:51;01:12:53;"- So is it like-- - Yeah, Dennis Quaid plays Reagan."
01:12:53;01:12:56;"- Is it like 60s and 70s era Reagan?"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"Like when he's like-- - I think it's--"
01:12:58;01:13:02;"I know that he's first in life, there's a character in it."
01:13:02;01:13:05;"So it's like, has to be like, I guess, like, pre-Nancy."
01:13:05;01:13:08;"- Interesting. - I'm sure it's like one of these ones,"
01:13:08;01:13:11;"which is like-- - Chad Kroger's playing John Wayne."
01:13:11;01:13:13;"- I could see that. - That'd be sick."
01:13:13;01:13:15;"But I like the idea of him singing,"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"Cassap singing Frank Sinatra."
01:13:17;01:13:22;"- Yeah, but, yeah, Creed's greatest hits on vinyl is fascinating."
01:13:22;01:13:25;"I mean, I know vinyl is huge,"
01:13:25;01:13:30;"and I can picture two distinct demographics."
01:13:30;01:13:32;"Like, you know, when I see the news,"
01:13:32;01:13:36;"like, ""Oh, Taylor Swift broke some vinyl sales record,"""
01:13:36;01:13:40;"I'm like, ""Okay, I can see how her fan base,"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"which includes people of all ages,"""
01:13:42;01:13:44;"but, you know, I guess what I'm saying is"
01:13:44;01:13:47;"when I hear about modern pop stars selling a lot of vinyl,"
01:13:47;01:13:49;"I can picture their younger fans"
01:13:49;01:13:52;"who are like already, you know, buying sweatshirts and T-shirts"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"and they want to own the vinyl."
01:13:54;01:13:57;"So I can picture that kind of young pop fan."
01:13:57;01:13:59;"And then, of course, I'm very familiar"
01:13:59;01:14:04;"with the kind of more, like, aging hipster crowd"
01:14:04;01:14:09;"who might want to buy vinyl from an indie band that they love"
01:14:09;01:14:12;"or buy, like, classic stuff or esoteric stuff"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"to have, like, a cool vinyl collection,"
01:14:14;01:14:17;"you know, who might have been to people's houses"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"who are, you know, in their 40s or 50s"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"and you look through their vinyl collection,"
01:14:21;01:14:23;"what have they bought that's new?"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"Maybe a cool soul jazz compilation"
01:14:25;01:14:29;"or, you know, something vibey to put on in the house."
01:14:29;01:14:32;"So I'm familiar with both those groups,"
01:14:32;01:14:35;"members of the vinyl buying public."
01:14:35;01:14:38;"The Creed's greatest hits on vinyl crowd"
01:14:38;01:14:41;"is hard for me to picture."
01:14:41;01:14:44;"- Tell me about this, how you feel about this"
01:14:44;01:14:47;"as even a way to put greatest hits together."
01:14:47;01:14:52;"So there's four songs from my own prism."
01:14:53;01:14:56;"There's four songs from Human Clay"
01:14:56;01:14:59;"and six songs from Weathered."
01:14:59;01:15:01;"That's it. I mean, even just--"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"- So there's three Creed albums?"
01:15:03;01:15:05;"- Yeah, I had just something about--"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"- Are there only three Creed albums?"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"- Three on greatest hits."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"Three that had any greatest hits."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"- Well, maybe this is greatest hits volume one."
01:15:13;01:15:15;"Well, I'll tell you something, Nick."
01:15:15;01:15:17;"That's the exact formula that created"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"one of the best-selling albums of all time, which is--"
01:15:19;01:15:21;"- Is that the Eagles? - The Eagles' greatest hits volume one,"
01:15:21;01:15:24;"because back in the day, you would sometimes do"
01:15:24;01:15:27;"a greatest hits as a way to kind of repackage"
01:15:27;01:15:31;"what an artist had accomplished on their last few albums,"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"and it would actually make them bigger."
01:15:33;01:15:35;"And I guess, you know, it's hard to picture"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"in the streaming era, 'cause you picture whatever."
01:15:37;01:15:39;"It's like 1974."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"The Eagles are this kind of, like, bubbling band."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"It made a lot of sense for their label to be like,"
01:15:43;01:15:46;"""Let's take the best songs off your first few albums,"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"package it as your greatest hits,"
01:15:48;01:15:51;"and create this, like, banger album,"""
01:15:51;01:15:53;"and then that goes on to become one of the best-selling records"
01:15:53;01:15:55;"of all time. - Well, I think--"
01:15:55;01:15:58;"Well, I think those songs were hits."
01:15:58;01:16:01;"Like, ""Lyin' Eyes,"" like, yeah,"
01:16:01;01:16:03;"it was, like, a Grammy Award-winning--yeah."
01:16:03;01:16:05;"- But somebody might say, ""All right, you have a few hits"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"off three albums. Like, that doesn't necessitate"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"a compilation."""
01:16:09;01:16:13;"But by putting those-- the best of those three albums together,"

01:17:37;01:17:39;"Welcome to the show."
01:17:39;01:17:41;"- Hey, what's up, guys?"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"- Seinfeld's hacked difficulties here."
01:17:43;01:17:45;"- Oh, we can hear you okay."
01:17:45;01:17:47;"- Okay, good. Thanks. How are you guys doing?"
01:17:47;01:17:49;"Can you recap the whole show for me so far?"
01:17:49;01:17:52;"- We've been talking your countrymen, Nickelback."
01:17:52;01:17:56;"How about--we want to give us the quick Canadian perspective on Nickelback."
01:17:56;01:17:59;"- Um, the Canadians--"
01:17:59;01:18:02;"I feel like the Canadians feel the same way"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"the general public does about them."
01:18:04;01:18:10;"I know that, you know, growing up in their heyday,"
01:18:10;01:18:13;"we were exposed to them quite a bit"
01:18:13;01:18:16;"due to Canada's much-discussed CanCon,"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"Canadian content rules."
01:18:18;01:18:21;"So we saw them on television quite a bit."
01:18:21;01:18:23;"Um, what can I say?"
01:18:23;01:18:26;"I--I--I had a--I had a journalist friend"
01:18:26;01:18:30;"interview them once when they were really breaking through,"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"and they had done a McDonald's partnership."
01:18:32;01:18:35;"And she said, ""How does it feel to be working for McDonald's"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"in, like, a cheeky way?"""
01:18:37;01:18:39;"And they were like, ""What are you talking about?"""
01:18:39;01:18:41;"And the interviewer was like, ""What are you talking about?"
01:18:41;01:18:43;"We don't work for McDonald's. What are you talking about?"
01:18:43;01:18:45;"What are you talking about?"" And I got really mad,"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"and then they had to, like, apologize"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"and take me for lunch after the fact."
01:18:49;01:18:52;"So, um, I guess Chad is a sensitive, um, fellow"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"when it comes to the journalism."
01:18:54;01:18:56;"- That might have been in the era"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"when they were getting hated on all the time."
01:18:58;01:19:01;"I guess for you, did you ever feel a sense of Canadian pride"
01:19:01;01:19:03;"or when people were beating up on Nickelback"
01:19:03;01:19:05;"and you were living down in the States,"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"did you ever feel a little bit like,"
01:19:07;01:19:09;"""We're allowed to make fun of them,"
01:19:09;01:19:11;"but those are my brothers""?"

01:19:18;01:19:20;"Saskatchewan? I don't know."
01:19:20;01:19:22;"When you hear about some guys"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"from a small town in Western Canada,"
01:19:24;01:19:26;"are you like, ""That has nothing to do with me"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"and my Canada""?"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"- I think it's more the latter."
01:19:30;01:19:33;"You know, uh, what are they--"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"How do I put it?"
01:19:35;01:19:39;"Western Canada, or at least that sort of, like,"
01:19:39;01:19:41;"Prairie Plains middle area"
01:19:41;01:19:44;"is kind of regarded in Canada"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"the way that, um, coastal elites"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"might view the American Bible Belt"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"in some ways."
01:19:50;01:19:52;"And so there isn't really, like,"
01:19:52;01:19:55;"a unified national pride over the boys."
01:19:55;01:19:57;"I will say that one song--"
01:19:57;01:19:59;"I don't know if you talked about it earlier,"
01:19:59;01:20:02;"but, um, ""Never Made It As A Wise Man."""
01:20:02;01:20:04;"- Oh, yeah, of course. We listened to it."
01:20:04;01:20:07;"- Okay. I mean, personally,"
01:20:07;01:20:09;"you know, all cultural"
01:20:09;01:20:11;"and sort of critical baggage aside,"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"that song is catchy as hell."
01:20:13;01:20:15;"- Yeah, well written."
01:20:15;01:20:17;"- Did you--was it--did you--"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"Did you appreciate the song when you were talking about it,"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"or was it kind of like--"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"- Well, as you can imagine, I was defending the--"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"- Oh, sure."
01:20:25;01:20:27;"- Chad's, uh, preternatural understanding"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"of pop architecture."
01:20:29;01:20:31;"And everybody admitted, like, yeah, you know,"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"there's, like, something to it."
01:20:33;01:20:36;"- When Chad was married to Avril Lavigne,"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"did that, uh,"
01:20:38;01:20:41;"that connection amp up the Canadian pride"
01:20:41;01:20:44;"when two of the greats came together?"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"- Amp up the Canadi--um, hmm."
01:20:46;01:20:48;"No, I think it was seen"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"as a very excessive partnership,"
01:20:50;01:20:53;"like a--like, they were both kind of"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"very accomplished at the time,"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"and I think it was a little bit like--"
01:20:57;01:20:59;"I don't know, maybe it's the closest thing Canada had"
01:20:59;01:21:03;"to, like, a Kim Kanye type of union."
01:21:03;01:21:05;"Both of them mega successful hit makers"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"in their own right coming together."
01:21:07;01:21:09;"I think it was a little--"
01:21:09;01:21:11;"maybe a little much for Canadian tastes."
01:21:11;01:21:13;"Uh, and it was--I don't know how long"
01:21:13;01:21:15;"they were together. It was kind of short-lived, right?"
01:21:15;01:21:17;"- Yeah, a few years. They're still friends."
01:21:17;01:21:19;"- Yeah."
01:21:19;01:21:22;"- Uh, I miss it. Are they from, uh, Alberta?"
01:21:22;01:21:24;"Yeah, where's--where's Hannah?"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"- Um, I think that is--"
01:21:26;01:21:28;"I think that is Alberta."
01:21:28;01:21:30;"Let me double check."
01:21:30;01:21:32;"Hannah Alberta sounds right."
01:21:32;01:21:34;"- Canadian Prairie."
01:21:34;01:21:36;"- Yeah, it's the plains."
01:21:36;01:21:38;"It's the--it's the flatlands of, uh, of Canada."
01:21:38;01:21:40;"Yeah, it is Alberta."
01:21:40;01:21:42;"- So they would have come up playing"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"the clubs of, uh, Calgary."
01:21:44;01:21:46;"- The Stampede."
01:21:46;01:21:48;"They probably--they probably played at the Stampede."
01:21:48;01:21:50;"- Maybe--maybe threw up the medicine hat,"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"played a gig."
01:21:52;01:21:54;"- Moose Jaw."
01:21:54;01:21:56;"They've seen the--the Moose Jaw."
01:21:56;01:21:59;"- They were--they were touring all over Canada."
01:21:59;01:22:01;"I mean, that's where, like--isn't Neil Young from--"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"is he--I know he's from the Prairie."
01:22:03;01:22:05;"I don't know if he's from Alberta."
01:22:05;01:22:07;"He might be from, um, the other province"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"to the east of there, but, um..."
01:22:09;01:22:11;"- Neil Young."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"Neil Young is from..."
01:22:13;01:22:15;"- There's--"
01:22:15;01:22:17;"- Oh, Winnipeg."
01:22:17;01:22:19;"No."
01:22:19;01:22:21;"Wait, is he--he was born in Toronto."
01:22:21;01:22:23;"I guess he blew up."
01:22:23;01:22:25;"He was based in Winnipeg?"
01:22:25;01:22:27;"I should know this."
01:22:27;01:22:29;"- Whatever."
01:22:29;01:22:31;"- Okay."
01:22:31;01:22:34;"- ♪ This is how you remind me ♪"
01:22:34;01:22:37;"♪ Of what I really am ♪"
01:22:37;01:22:39;"- So, Ezra, do you have a song of the summer?"
01:22:39;01:22:41;"- Well, there's a couple"
01:22:41;01:22:43;"that I've been thinking about."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"I don't know why. Certain songs get into my head."
01:22:45;01:22:47;"I mean, I'll start with this,"
01:22:47;01:22:50;"because I feel like I talk so little about new music,"
01:22:50;01:22:52;"and the truth is,"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"on the--I kind of follow new music,"
01:22:54;01:22:56;"and I do and I don't."
01:22:56;01:22:58;"- Yeah."
01:22:58;01:23:00;"- So I do feel like, especially on this show,"
01:23:00;01:23:03;"we tend to, you know, dig into the past."
01:23:03;01:23:06;"We talk a lot about different eras."
01:23:06;01:23:09;"You know, it is time crisis, after all."
01:23:09;01:23:12;"But it's rare that we just kind of talk about new bands,"
01:23:12;01:23:15;"and this band's not even that new."
01:23:15;01:23:18;"I have been having a moment of fandom"
01:23:18;01:23:22;"and interest in the band Fontaines, D.C."
01:23:22;01:23:24;"You guys know them?"
01:23:24;01:23:26;"- Heard of them."
01:23:26;01:23:28;"- It was kind of fun. Like, I'd heard the name."
01:23:28;01:23:31;"They've been releasing records since, I think, 2019."
01:23:31;01:23:33;"Irish band."
01:23:33;01:23:36;"Somebody actually put me onto the singer's solo work,"
01:23:36;01:23:38;"and I was listening to his solo album,"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"and I was like, ""Oh, this is really good."
01:23:40;01:23:42;"Wait, who's this again? Oh, he's in that band."""
01:23:42;01:23:44;"So anyway, I was, like, checking out the guy's solo album,"
01:23:44;01:23:46;"and I was like, ""Oh, I want to check this band out more."""
01:23:46;01:23:48;"So I started to listen to them,"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"and then, right, like, a month after that,"
01:23:50;01:23:53;"they launched their new album,"
01:23:53;01:23:55;"which is coming out in August."
01:23:55;01:23:57;"But--so they put out the first single,"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"and this is the song called ""Starburster."""
01:23:59;01:24:02;"And there was something-- so they're not a new band,"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"but whatever, they've only been releasing records"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"for five years."
01:24:06;01:24:09;"They're kind of entering phase two, I guess, of their career."
01:24:09;01:24:12;"And there's a lot of things that I like about this,"
01:24:12;01:24:15;"and I've been--I love the music video for this song."
01:24:15;01:24:18;"And also I like that they're kind of changing up"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"their aesthetic."
01:24:20;01:24:22;"You can see from the press pictures"
01:24:22;01:24:24;"that the band is dressing differently."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"To me, that's one of, like, the--"
01:24:26;01:24:29;"the real hallmarks of, like, sometimes for me"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"when I get interested in an artist"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"is when you can see they're kind of entering a new era,"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"and you're like, ""Oh, you can do a lot of different stuff."""
01:24:35;01:24:37;"You had that kind of vibe."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"Now you're changing up the clothes a little bit,"
01:24:39;01:24:41;"changing up the sound, and I think that's where this band is now."
01:24:41;01:24:44;"And this song--this is kind of a big song"
01:24:44;01:24:46;"for, like, when I've--people--"
01:24:46;01:24:48;"when I've been talking with people about rock music."
01:24:48;01:24:50;"Like, a lot of people are like, ""Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,"
01:24:50;01:24:52;"I like that band. I like that song."""
01:24:52;01:24:54;"Have you guys heard it? It's called ""Starburster."""
01:24:54;01:24:56;"I don't think so."
01:24:56;01:25:00;"To anybody listening,"
01:25:00;01:25:03;"later, go watch the video."
01:25:03;01:25:06;"It's one of the weirdest, most interesting videos"
01:25:06;01:25:10;"I've seen from a rock band in a few years."
01:25:22;01:25:25;"So this is like kind of a left turn for this band,"
01:25:25;01:25:29;"but it's made me interested in, like, their whole catalog."
01:25:29;01:25:33;"I wanna see you alone"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"I wanna shag your stone"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"I wanna bounce your bone"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"I wanna mess with it"
01:25:39;01:25:41;"I want a lady to feel"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"A heart grilled in the seal"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"I want the preacher to appeal"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"I wanna bless with it"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"I wanna head to a mass and get class in it"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"It's funnier than any A-class in it"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"I wanna write the phone"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"I wanna bleed the town"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"I wanna see you alone, alone, alone, alone"
01:25:57;01:25:59;"I wanna strike the shack"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"I find the stone when I pack"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"Like the light when it's packed"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"A few stacks of belt"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"I mean, I love the strong Irish accent"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"and the way this dude sings."
01:26:09;01:26:11;"For a GPR with all the hits in it"
01:26:11;01:26:13;"I'm gonna hit your business"
01:26:13;01:26:16;"If it's momentary blissness"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"I'm gonna hit your business"
01:26:18;01:26:21;"If it's momentary blissness"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"I'm gonna hit your business"
01:26:23;01:26:26;"If it's momentary blissness"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"I'm gonna hit your business"
01:26:28;01:26:31;"If it's momentary"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"I wanna talk with a gank"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"If it's a bottle of black"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"I wanna strike the sack"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"I need the fan from it"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"I wanna shut in the deck"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"I wanna make you mad"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"I wanna lift the act"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"I call the ants on it"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"I wanna take the truth"
01:26:49;01:26:52;"Already I like her more"
01:26:52;01:26:54;"Already I like her more"
01:26:54;01:26:57;"Already I like her more"
01:27:00;01:27:04;"Did you know I can claim the dreamer from the dream"
01:27:04;01:27:09;"Make you feel everything you've never even seen"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"Yeah, this is tight"
01:27:11;01:27:16;"Yeah, it's been along, along, along, along, along, long"
01:27:16;01:27:21;"You and my things have fought a long time"
01:27:21;01:27:24;"Is this on their upcoming record or is it an older?"
01:27:24;01:27:27;"Yeah, so these are the two singles"
01:27:27;01:27:30;"and the album's out next month"
01:27:30;01:27:32;"You will see"
01:27:32;01:27:36;"You will see give the way to something strange"
01:27:36;01:27:42;"Yeah, it's been along, along, along, along, along, long"
01:27:42;01:27:46;"You and my things have fought a long time"
01:27:46;01:27:47;"A long time"
01:27:47;01:27:53;"Well, no cue shows the newest clown"
01:27:53;01:27:56;"35 hours coming down"
01:27:56;01:27:59;"How the sun shines on new pavement"
01:27:59;01:28:02;"And you don't even feel it"
01:28:02;01:28:05;"It's a cry from their radios"
01:28:05;01:28:08;"The dates they're playing for buying dollars"
01:28:08;01:28:12;"When they painted town with that shirt"
01:28:12;01:28:14;"They never even wanted to know, yeah"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"You and my things have fought a long time"
01:28:17;01:28:21;"Yeah, it's been along, along, along, along, long"
01:28:21;01:28:25;"You and my things have fought a long time"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"A long time"

01:30:07;01:30:11;"Yeah, it's been along, along, along, long, long, long"
01:30:11;01:30:14;"It's these opening lyrics."

01:30:17;01:30:20;"Living on the road, my friend"

01:31:05;01:31:07;"Yeah, actually, I gotta think about it."
01:31:07;01:31:09;"Why is that so evocative?"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"I think there's something, too, about, like..."
01:31:11;01:31:14;"Obviously, there's so much language culturally"
01:31:14;01:31:17;"in songs and movies and inspirational posters"

01:31:42;01:31:45;"This idea of the opposite, sinking into your dreams."
01:31:45;01:31:47;"It's like some ""be careful what you wish for"" s--t."

01:32:13;01:32:15;"is falling into delusion."

01:35:31;01:35:32;"Interesting."
01:35:32;01:35:34;"This song clearly takes place"
01:35:34;01:35:37;"after the golden age of cowboys."
01:35:37;01:35:38;"Oh, right."
01:35:38;01:35:39;"And the Wild West."
01:35:39;01:35:41;"This song clearly is about--"
01:35:41;01:35:44;"or at least takes place in the era"
01:35:44;01:35:47;"of Codes of the Road breaking down."
01:35:47;01:35:49;"Like, this is not about a dude"
01:35:49;01:35:51;"who had these dreams to go out West,"
01:35:51;01:35:53;"and he was, like, a gunslinger,"
01:35:53;01:35:54;"and, you know, like--"
01:35:54;01:35:55;"It's not 19th century."
01:35:55;01:35:58;"No, no, this is, like, the tail end of it."
01:35:58;01:35:59;"A la Tony Soprano,"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"Lefty did not get in on the ground floor,"
01:36:01;01:36:04;"and so he sinks into his dreams."
01:36:04;01:36:05;"He links up with perhaps"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"an honorable guy, Poncho."
01:36:07;01:36:09;"Poncho wore his gun outside his pants"
01:36:09;01:36:12;"for all the honest world to fear."
01:36:12;01:36:14;"Like, he was an honest dude."
01:36:14;01:36:16;"He's old school, plays by the code."
01:36:16;01:36:17;"I got my gun out."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"I'm not trying to hide anything from you."
01:36:19;01:36:21;"And this dude, Lefty, gets mixed up with him."
01:36:21;01:36:23;"But you already have, like, this world"
01:36:23;01:36:26;"of kind of lies and betrayals."
01:36:26;01:36:29;"Seemingly, Lefty got mixed up in something"
01:36:29;01:36:32;"and probably, like, turned Poncho in"
01:36:32;01:36:34;"or did wrong by him."
01:36:34;01:36:36;"Like, maybe Lefty got stuck in a situation"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"where he's like, ""Yeah, nobody's quite sure"
01:36:38;01:36:41;"how Lefty found the bread to get back to Ohio."""
01:36:41;01:36:43;"That implies that, like, he should have--"
01:36:43;01:36:46;"he should have stayed there and died with his boy."
01:36:46;01:36:48;"So we get the impression that Lefty"
01:36:48;01:36:50;"is maybe a little crooked,"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"or he was just, like, in over his head."
01:36:52;01:36:54;"Maybe somebody was like, ""Yo, listen, dude."
01:36:54;01:36:56;"We're gonna kill you unless you tell us where Poncho is."""
01:36:56;01:36:58;"So Lefty--there might be something dishonest"
01:36:58;01:36:59;"about Lefty."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"And then also, the Federales,"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"as we hear in the chorus,"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"are these, like, kind of blowhards"

01:37:09;01:37:11;"they almost had him any day."
01:37:11;01:37:13;"Oh, I guess they just let him get away"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"'cause they were--they're just nice guys, right?"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"Like, everybody's kind of full of [bleep]"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"- It reminds me of, like, a--I mean,"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"maybe it's just 'cause we're talking about Lebowski,"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"but it makes me think of a Coen Brothers movie,"

01:37:29;01:37:31;"it's very Coen."
01:37:31;01:37:34;"- This might even be set in, like, the '60s or something."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"- Right, like, it's like guys--"
01:37:36;01:37:38;"- It's literally a dude who grew up"

01:37:41;01:37:44;"who was like, ""You know, one day that's gonna be me."""
01:37:44;01:37:46;"And then he meets this dude Poncho,"
