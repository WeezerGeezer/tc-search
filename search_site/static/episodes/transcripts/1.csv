13:37;13:40;"And he looked at me like, ""No, mm-mm"""
13:40;13:43;"And then he grabbed my hand like a sandwich"
13:43;13:45;"And he bit into it really hard"
13:45;13:49;"And my hand was just like white for two full minutes"
13:49;13:53;"And then it just started gushing blood everywhere"
13:53;13:57;"And yeah, he's cute, but he's a wild animal"
13:57;14:00;"I still have the scar, yeah, on my left thumb"
14:00;14:02;"Yeah, I still have the scar"

29:55;30:01;"So what's up Mark, you're in New York, we're very lucky that I just randomly emailed you. I don't know, I had like a spidey sense that you might be in New York."
30:01;30:02;"Yeah."
30:02;30:03;"'Cause you're from New York."
30:03;30:04;"I'm from New York."
30:04;30:05;"Where were you born?"
30:05;30:09;"Originally I was born in London, but I moved to New York when I was eight. So I grew up in New York pretty much."
30:09;30:10;"So from eight to..."
30:10;30:12;"I grew up in New York from eight to about 45."
30:12;30:14;"Eight to 45."
30:14;30:15;"Eight to..."
30:15;30:16;"Age 46."
30:16;30:20;"Eight to 32, about. And then the last five years I've lived in England."
30:20;30:21;"You lived in New York more than London."
30:21;30:32;"Yeah. I definitely feel spiritually like a New Yorker for whatever that means. I feel like when I'm in this city, it's like I know the rhythm of it. I love London too, it's
amazing, but I spend so much time here."
30:32;30:40;"As someone who feels like he's allowed to tell people whether or not they're from New York, I would say you're from New York. You spent your formative years here."
30:40;30:41;"Thank you."
30:41;30:45;"I really need to get sound effects on deck in the future."
30:45;30:46;"One for each borough."
30:46;30:47;"Yeah."
30:47;30:52;"Yeah, that would be the Queen's sound effect because the endorsement was coming from Queen."
30:52;30:56;"Exactly. So you came back here for your friend's wedding?"
30:56;30:57;"I came back..."
30:57;30:58;"High school friend?"
30:58;30:59;"High school friend."
30:59;31:00;"Where'd you go to high school?"
31:00;31:01;"I went to a school called Collegiate High School."
31:01;31:02;"On the Upper West Side?"
31:02;31:03;"Yeah."
31:03;31:04;"They had a good wrestling program."
31:04;31:06;"Not when I was on it."
31:06;31:08;"Wait, were you on the wrestling team?"
31:08;31:09;"Yeah."
31:09;31:10;"Oh my God."
31:10;31:11;"This is terrible."
31:11;31:12;"Wait, you got the totally wrong body type for wrestling."
31:12;31:14;"I had the wrong body type for everything."
31:14;31:16;"No, you could have been okay at basketball."
31:16;31:17;"But I didn't have the coordination."
31:17;31:25;"I moved from New York to New York when I was just old enough to have missed all the kiddie sports camps and anything that would have given me a leg up."
31:25;31:28;"And I definitely didn't have the... Some people know this story."
31:28;31:30;"You weren't playing sports in the UK?"
31:30;31:38;"Yeah, but football. But then I got here and it was like everyone assumed that I was going to be really good at football, soccer, because I was from England and I wasn't."
31:38;31:41;"So there was massive levels of disappointment."
31:41;31:47;"And then I ran... I told this story a couple of times. I apologize if you heard it."
31:47;31:50;"But I ran the wrong way in the relay race at field day."
31:50;31:56;"So the coach called me Wrong Way Ronson and that name actually stuck for like seven years because it sounded so good."
31:56;31:57;"Does anybody still call you that?"
31:57;32:06;"Yeah, my friend. Anybody who knew me from the third grade, he has that song, ""The Wrong Way"" by Sublime as the ringtone when I call him."
32:06;32:08;"My friend Daniel, thank you."
32:08;32:13;"All right, let's play a new song from my man Mark Ronson. How about ""Feel Right""?"

32:40;32:44;"I eat flames up, craft fire out. You make me light my boat."

33:35;33:37;"Don't let go the muscle or you gon' pull it out the socket."
33:37;33:39;"It's exercise with thighs and hip muscles."
33:39;33:41;"This exercise you gon' burn some lip muscles."

33:55;33:58;"To make matters worse, you gotta go to the studio of Bruno Mars."
33:58;33:59;"On another planet."
33:59;34:00;"Don't get mad, I'm just saying it."
34:00;34:01;"Don't believe it 'cause I'm saying it."
34:01;34:03;"Believe it 'til I'm dead."
34:03;34:05;"I'm doing the rapping and the bustling."
34:05;34:07;"Ronson on the smacking and the cutting."
34:09;34:11;"Come on, come on, come on."
34:11;34:13;"Feel right in this mother f***."
34:13;34:14;"Right."
34:14;34:15;"Feel good in this mother f***."
34:15;34:16;"Right."
34:16;34:17;"My whole hood in this mother f***."
34:17;34:18;"Right."
34:18;34:20;"And we gon' ride this mother f*** all night."
34:20;34:21;"Feel right in this mother f***."
34:21;34:22;"Right."
34:22;34:23;"Feel good in this mother f***."
34:23;34:24;"Right."
34:24;34:25;"My whole hood in this mother f***."
34:25;34:26;"Right."
34:26;34:29;"And we gon' ride this mother f*** all night."
34:29;34:31;"And we gon' ride this mother f*** all night."
34:31;34:33;"Yeah, we gon' ride this mother f*** all night."
34:33;34:34;"Bang!"
34:37;34:39;"Get down."
34:42;34:43;"Come on."
34:44;34:45;"Wait a minute now."
34:45;34:47;"Give it to 'em on the one."
34:47;34:49;"Uh, this the intermission."
34:49;34:51;"Break it down so the people listen."
34:51;34:53;"Take a second to wipe my sweat."
34:53;34:55;"Might be the only chance you get to catch your breath."
34:55;34:57;"Don't get too comfortable here."
34:57;34:59;"Better believe I'm bringing better ruffle in here."
34:59;35:03;"Just when you thought you can cool down and sip some of that water."
35:03;35:04;"Shit."
35:06;35:07;"I'm back."
35:07;35:08;"Say it again."
35:08;35:09;"Feel right in this mother f***."
35:09;35:10;"Right."
35:10;35:11;"Feel good in this mother f***."
35:11;35:12;"Right."
35:12;35:13;"My whole hood in this mother f***."
35:13;35:14;"Right."
35:14;35:16;"And we gon' ride this mother f*** all night."
35:16;35:18;"Feel right in this mother f***."
35:18;35:19;"Right."
35:19;35:20;"Feel good in this mother f***."
35:20;35:21;"Right."
35:21;35:22;"My whole hood in this mother f***."
35:22;35:23;"Right."
35:23;35:25;"And we gon' ride this mother f*** all night."
35:27;35:29;"Yeah, we gon' ride this mother f*** all night."
35:29;35:30;"Bang!"
35:31;35:33;"Ladies and gentlemen, one more time."
35:33;35:34;"Put your hands together for Mystica."
35:36;35:38;"Don't it feel good?"
35:38;35:39;"Ain't it making us feel good tonight?"
35:42;35:44;"Thank you Mr. Ronson for bringing us together this evening."
35:46;35:48;"We're gon' go ahead and head over to the after party."
35:49;35:50;"We'll see y'all uptown."
35:51;35:52;"Come on."
35:52;35:53;"What's up?"
35:53;35:55;"You're listening to Time Crisis with Ezra."
35:55;35:58;"I'm here with Despot and our special guest, Mark Ronson."
35:58;35:59;"Yo."
35:59;36:01;"[applause]"
36:01;36:03;"The Mark Ronson we were talking about before."
36:03;36:04;"He's from New York."
36:04;36:05;"I feel like a lot of people don't know that."
36:05;36:06;"Yeah."
36:06;36:09;"You find that generally people are confused and dismayed by your accent?"
36:09;36:10;"Or they like it?"
36:10;36:14;"I think it's weird because, you know, when I moved here when I was eight,"
36:14;36:15;"I had a funny accent."
36:15;36:17;"Kids, you know, they tease you."
36:17;36:19;"They call me ""Calmy."""
36:19;36:21;"It doesn't make a lot of sense, but I was called ""Calmy."""
36:21;36:23;"So you're just like, you're gonna fit in."
36:23;36:26;"So I probably started sounding American anyway because I lived here."
36:26;36:28;"And then when I go back to England, they'll be like,"
36:28;36:30;"""Why do you sound American all of a sudden?"""
36:30;36:35;"So you're in this sort of middle ground you don't really sound like anywhere."
36:35;36:36;"And it's just what happens."
36:36;36:40;"So I used to hate it, and now I just know this is my voice."
36:40;36:41;"I live with it."
36:41;36:45;"But I do wish I just had one accent that just stayed no matter where I went."
36:45;36:46;"But that's not gonna happen."
36:46;36:48;"I like the right in the middle accent."
36:48;36:50;"I like--well, yours is authentic."
36:50;36:52;"It's funny because it reminds me of--"
36:52;36:57;"there are rich New York kids who try to speak like they have an English accent."
36:57;36:58;"Really?"
36:58;37:03;"You only get real cred if you have lived in both England and America"
37:03;37:04;"before the age of 18."
37:04;37:05;"Right."
37:05;37:06;"Okay."
37:06;37:07;"Which you did."
37:07;37:08;"Yeah, I did."
37:08;37:09;"There are all these rules."
37:09;37:11;"So now you're from New York, and your accent is valid."
37:11;37:12;"Yeah."
37:12;37:13;"Yes."
37:13;37:15;"I'm leaving here with two gold stars today."
37:15;37:17;"I'm interested--I feel like a lot of people--"
37:17;37:21;"do you feel like because you just dropped one of the biggest songs of all time"
37:21;37:25;"that a lot of people don't understand who Mark Ronson is?"
37:25;37:27;"Like your name is out there like it's never been before,"
37:27;37:30;"but you've got also more people probably more confused than ever before."
37:30;37:35;"Probably, but you know, like I can't--the song and the song doing what it does"
37:35;37:38;"is incredible, and if that means that certain people want to go back"
37:38;37:41;"and check out stuff I've done before or some people really just don't care"
37:41;37:44;"and they just want to say they like that song, it's kind of okay."
37:44;37:49;"But I think that it's such a funny era that we're in with the producer DJ"
37:49;37:52;"and the producer's artist and, you know, people like Calvin Harris"
37:52;37:56;"and Ghetto and Avicii and their names being in front of the singers and stuff."
37:56;37:59;"It's like I don't think anybody knows what any of these people do,"
37:59;38:03;"and it's because producer is such a kind of vague blanket term."
38:03;38:05;"It means such different things to different people,"
38:05;38:08;"what you do technically in the studio."
38:08;38:12;"So I don't think--I don't know what half of these people do"
38:12;38:13;"when I see their names on the record."
38:13;38:16;"I don't know if they've got like three interns in a room making beats"
38:16;38:18;"or they're doing it themselves or whatever."
38:18;38:19;"Do you have interns?"
38:19;38:20;"I don't."
38:20;38:21;"Do you have assistants?"
38:21;38:22;"I don't."
38:22;38:25;"I have--I wish--it would probably be good if I did,"
38:25;38:27;"and I'd probably be more prolific and have more output,"
38:27;38:29;"but I have a specific thing that I know what I like"
38:29;38:33;"and I've never met anybody that I could rip off that could do that for me."
38:33;38:34;"Wait, but who gets your dry cleaning?"
38:34;38:35;"They deliver."
38:35;38:36;"Nice."
38:36;38:37;"Yeah."
38:37;38:39;"If I'm not home, they just leave it under the mat."
38:39;38:41;"You got a cleaning lady?"
38:41;38:43;"Twice a week."
38:43;38:44;"That's pretty frequent."
38:44;38:45;"It's good."
38:45;38:47;"I do once every other."
38:47;38:48;"Lord Ronson."
38:48;38:50;"He must be very clean."
38:50;38:52;"Yeah, I don't really make much."

43:00;43:04;"- You're listening to Time Crisis."
43:04;43:08;"Music so hot, it'll melt your face off."
43:08;43:09;"- So Mark, you as an artist,"
43:09;43:11;"I think a lot of people don't understand,"
43:11;43:15;"you come from a straight up hip hop DJ tradition."
43:15;43:16;"- Yeah."
43:16;43:17;"- A 90s hip hop DJ tradition."
43:17;43:20;"- 90s hip hop DJ, that was the music that I loved"
43:20;43:21;"and I was like, okay, well I can't rap,"
43:21;43:22;"I don't know anything about making beats,"
43:22;43:23;"so I'm gonna DJ."
43:23;43:26;"So I would listen to Stretch Arms,"
43:26;43:28;"Talking About Vito and Flex and Red Alert,"
43:28;43:31;"Go To Club, See Clark Kent, all these DJs."
43:31;43:33;"- So this is mid 90s?"
43:33;43:36;"- Yeah, this is '93, I was 17."
43:36;43:39;"And yeah, and that was it."
43:39;43:41;"So I kinda came up, I kinda got on fast"
43:41;43:44;"'cause I was just annoying to club promoters all the time"
43:44;43:45;"and I was opening for Stretch."
43:45;43:46;"- How'd you dress back then?"
43:46;43:48;"- And Master Flex and stuff."
43:48;43:51;"I dressed slightly, I mean I was known"
43:51;43:53;"to rock the odd Aniche jumpsuit,"
43:53;43:57;"but for the most part, just a cool T-shirt"
43:57;44:00;"from Supreme or something and a pair of pseudo baggy jeans."
44:00;44:01;"- Like a beastie boy."
44:01;44:02;"- Right."
44:02;44:04;"- As a DJ, you were working with vinyl,"
44:04;44:05;"you could scratch?"
44:05;44:07;"- Yeah, I mean not A-track scratching,"
44:07;44:09;"but definitely DJ premier level."
44:09;44:11;"Well premier is incredible, but it was about,"
44:11;44:15;"I was probably, that was my hero who I tried to emulate."
44:15;44:17;"- So that's the milieu that Mark Ronson comes from."
44:17;44:19;"- That's where I came from and I think"
44:19;44:21;"that that's a pretty good background blueprint"
44:21;44:22;"to have for sure because it's like,"
44:22;44:23;"if you understand that stuff--"
44:23;44:25;"- Because you're not like a pop guy."
44:25;44:26;"- No."
44:26;44:27;"- See, I think a lot of people,"
44:27;44:30;"maybe just based on your most famous work,"
44:30;44:32;"being that it's stuff that crossed over into the pop realm,"
44:32;44:34;"they might think of you as more like"
44:34;44:36;"one of those Swedish guys."
44:37;44:38;"- Oh boy, Swedish."
44:38;44:39;"Well maybe--"
44:39;44:40;"- No, but I don't even sing in a bad way."
44:40;44:41;"- No, no, no, I know, but like,"
44:41;44:45;"oh he's just a new one of these new breed of DJ,"
44:45;44:47;"songwriter dudes who just had this song,"
44:47;44:48;"is that what you mean?"
44:48;44:49;"- Yeah, because maybe they're not sure where you're from,"
44:49;44:51;"so they don't think of you as being rooted"
44:51;44:53;"in a specific culture or scene or something."
44:53;44:56;"- Right, I guess it's a little different in England"
44:56;44:59;"where people know some of the other records I've done."
44:59;45:00;"- Right."
45:00;45:02;"- The ""Ooey"" was my first single there with Ghostface,"
45:02;45:04;"so I guess that's why it's sort of--"
45:04;45:05;"- That's what I always knew you as,"
45:05;45:07;"the guy who did that Ghostface song."
45:07;45:08;"That was it."
45:08;45:12;"- But most of the people, that's all I thought"
45:12;45:13;"you would ever do."
45:13;45:14;"- Yeah, let's listen to that song."
45:14;45:17;"Is this fair to say this is Mark Ronson's first hit?"
45:17;45:19;"- This was, well it wouldn't be fair to say"
45:19;45:21;"it was really a hit, but definitely it was my first record"
45:21;45:23;"that was like commercially available."

48:57;48:58;"What year was that?"
48:58;49:00;"That was 2003."
49:00;49:01;"That sounds about right."
49:01;49:02;"That wasn't even that long ago."
49:02;49:03;"No."
49:03;49:05;"Your music career started relatively late."
49:05;49:07;"I did. I produced --"
49:07;49:08;"'Cause how old are you now? You're 39 years old?"
49:08;49:09;"I'm 39."
49:09;49:11;"I produced a few records."
49:11;49:13;"This girl named Nika Costa was the first thing I ever produced."
49:13;49:15;"Oh, yeah. Wait, was there a song called ""Light as a Feather""?"
49:15;49:16;"""Like a Feather."""
49:16;49:18;"She did the Tommy Hilfiger commercial or something."
49:18;49:19;"Exactly."
49:19;49:20;"Yeah. Wait, was she British?"
49:20;49:23;"She was from L.A."
49:23;49:24;"She's not. Okay."
49:24;49:26;"And I just met her 'cause I was DJing in clubs a lot."
49:26;49:27;"And, you know, people come up 'cause, you know,"
49:27;49:29;"when you're DJing, like, the cool parties"
49:29;49:31;"and people are, like, just waiting for you to get on the list"
49:31;49:33;"and you end up kind of beating everybody."
49:33;49:35;"So this guy came up to me and was like,"
49:35;49:37;"""Oh, I like the way you DJ. I got this girl, Nika Costa."
49:37;49:39;"I don't know what her record should sound like,"
49:39;49:40;"but I want it to feel like your DJ set."""
49:40;49:43;"'Cause I was playing, obviously, mostly hip-hop,"
49:43;49:45;"but then, you know, DJing --"
49:45;49:46;"Of meters?"
49:46;49:48;"Meters, but then mixing in, you know,"
49:48;49:51;"the odd AC/DC or Seven Nation Army,"
49:51;49:53;"the things that not a lot of other people were playing back then,"
49:53;49:56;"which, hard to think, because now everybody plays everything."
49:56;49:59;"The mashup thing became way out of hand."
49:59;50:02;"But, yeah, so he asked me to produce that record."
50:02;50:03;"Nika Costa. You produced the whole album?"
50:03;50:04;"Yeah."
50:04;50:06;"Was that kind of a big album?"
50:06;50:07;"That song was huge."
50:07;50:08;"The song was, like --"
50:08;50:09;"What was the song called?"
50:09;50:10;"""Like a Feather."""
50:10;50:11;"And there was this --"
50:11;50:12;"♪ Bum, bum, bum, bum ♪"
50:12;50:14;"Yeah. That was my first --"
50:14;50:15;"But that was just me --"
50:15;50:17;"In my head, I was just ripping off DJ Premier,"
50:17;50:20;"like, the kind of stab chop, the swung drums and things."
50:20;50:22;"And he actually came in the booth one time when I was DJing."
50:22;50:24;"I never met him when I was playing that song."
50:24;50:26;"And he was like, ""Who made this song?"""
50:26;50:27;"I was like, ""He's gonna kick my ass."""
50:27;50:29;"I was like, ""Uh..."""
50:29;50:32;"I was stumbling just 'cause I was so nervous"
50:32;50:33;"to meet my hero, as well."
50:33;50:34;"And I was like, ""I did."""
50:34;50:35;"So he goes, ""This is tough,"""
50:35;50:37;"and just was, like, three minutes in the booth going like that."
50:37;50:39;"And I was like, ""Nothing will ever be better than this moment."""
50:39;50:41;"That's amazing. We should listen to that."
50:41;50:43;"Is it fair to say this is Mark Ronson's second hit?"
50:43;50:45;"This was before --"
50:45;50:46;"Unfortunately, neither of these songs were hits."
50:46;50:48;"This one came before ""Oui."""
50:48;50:50;"This is Mark Ronson's..."
50:50;50:51;"First hit."
50:51;50:53;"Mark Ronson's other first hit."
50:53;50:55;"""Nica Costa,"" ""Like a Feather."""
50:55;51:05;"♪♪"
54:45;54:48;"That was Mark Ronson's first hit, ""Nica Costa,"" ""Like a Feather."""
54:48;54:50;"What happened to her?"
54:50;54:54;"She was on some, like, smoky voice, like, you know,"
54:54;54:56;"whatever jazz club girl thingy type."
54:56;54:59;"Yeah. She's cool. She still makes records."
54:59;55:01;"We never worked together after that, but she's --"
55:01;55:04;"You know, she's got a great voice, and she still does shows and stuff."
55:04;55:06;"When you were talking before about being really awkward"
55:06;55:09;"in front of a DJ premiere, that reminded me that you have"
55:09;55:12;"some really good stories about being awkward in front of people."
55:12;55:13;"Can we get into any of them?"
55:13;55:15;"Okay."
55:15;55:18;"I just like the one about at the Rock Nation brunch."
55:18;55:19;"Oh, yeah, that was really bad."
55:19;55:21;"'Cause that doesn't reflect badly on anybody, right?"
55:21;55:22;"No, really."
55:22;55:23;"You could tell the story."
55:23;55:25;"I think the story's also very indicative of the real Mark Ronson."
55:25;55:27;"Okay, so I was at the Rock Nation brunch,"
55:27;55:29;"which is basically Jay-Z's management company."
55:29;55:32;"It happens every year after the Grammys or the day before,"
55:32;55:35;"and I was a little hungover, a little worse for wear."
55:35;55:38;"And, you know, everyone must go up to Jay-Z and say hi."
55:38;55:42;"I was like, I can't imagine how many people he actually wants to say hi to."
55:42;55:43;"So my friend comes up."
55:43;55:45;"He's like, ""You know, you should really go say hi to Jay."""
55:45;55:47;"I'm like, ""He doesn't care. Come on."
55:47;55:51;"He needs another person going to that crowded-ass VIP room."""
55:51;55:53;"He's like, ""No, you should go. You should go."""
55:53;55:54;"So I'm like, ""Okay."""
55:54;55:56;"'Cause I was managed by Rock Nation at the time."
55:56;55:57;"So I was like, ""All right."""
55:57;56:02;"And I just kind of lost any idea or grasp of English language"
56:02;56:04;"as I was getting closer to him."
56:04;56:07;"And I go, ""Hey."""
56:07;56:09;"And he just looks at me and, you know, everybody sort of knows"
56:09;56:13;"he's an incredibly friendly guy, but you sort of can catch him at a different time"
56:13;56:17;"and you don't know quite what you're going to get."
56:17;56:19;"And he said, ""Hey."""
56:19;56:24;"And then there's this really awkward pause, and I said, ""Yeah, I mean, good."""
56:26;56:32;"And he just looked at me like confused, 'cause it is confusing,"
56:32;56:34;"'cause I answered a question that he did not ask."
56:34;56:36;"'Cause you did not say, ""How are you?"""
56:36;56:40;"And then just because I was already going in this tailspin mode, I just said,"
56:40;56:43;"""Oh, yeah, because when you didn't say anything after I said, 'Hey,'"
56:43;56:47;"I kind of imagined in my head that you had said, 'How are you?'"
56:47;56:48;"So I said, 'I've been good.'"""
56:48;56:50;"And at that point it was just like,"
56:50;56:56;"""Please remove this man from the VIP or life."""
56:56;56:58;"But yeah, that was kind of embarrassing."
56:58;57:00;"You ruined Jay-Z's brunch."
57:00;57:03;"No, no way. I think it was just more like a lol."
57:03;57:06;"I think I told you guys both one of my Jay-Z stories."
57:06;57:08;"Also a very subtle story."
57:08;57:09;"I was going to make sure that you have to--"
57:09;57:10;"Yeah, well, everybody has to tell a Jay-Z story."
57:10;57:12;"This is at No Name, right? This is the one?"
57:12;57:13;"Yeah, this is the one at No Name."
57:13;57:14;"This is great."
57:14;57:18;"I was at a party at No Name, and I was there with a lady,"
57:18;57:22;"and she really wanted to dance, and I'm not much of a dancer,"
57:22;57:25;"but she was going pretty hard dancing and pulled me to dance with her,"
57:25;57:28;"and I probably looked a little tense and just awkwardly snapping my fingers."
57:28;57:33;"And meanwhile, Jay and Beyonce were dancing very casually,"
57:33;57:35;"just having a great time throughout the whole party."
57:35;57:36;"They're about ten feet away from us."
57:36;57:38;"They're in their own world, so whatever."
57:38;57:40;"And then a little bit later, I see Jay Brown,"
57:40;57:44;"who's one of the people who runs Rock Nation, and he--"
57:44;57:45;"Same thing."
57:45;57:47;"""Oh, Ezra, have you seen Jay? You should come say hi to him."
57:47;57:48;"I've met him a few times before."""
57:48;57:50;"And I was like, ""Oh, I don't want to bother him."""
57:50;57:52;"""No, no, no, come on. He'd love to see you. Come say hi."""
57:52;57:53;"And I said, ""Okay."""
57:53;57:56;"""Hey, Jay,"" and I made some kind of awkward small talk like,"
57:56;57:58;"""Oh, so you live in L.A. now?"""
57:58;57:59;"""Yeah, yeah, I live in L.A. now."""
57:59;58:01;"""Oh, did you buy a house?"""
58:01;58:03;"""No, we're renting one now. We're looking."""
58:03;58:05;"You know, just like, again, it's hard to know what to say."
58:05;58:06;"I was starstruck, too."
58:06;58:09;"And then at a certain point, he's like, ""Yeah, yeah, that's cool. That's cool."""
58:09;58:13;"And then he just kind of leaned over to me, almost like Don Corleone or something."
58:13;58:18;"He's like, ""I saw you before. That girl was trying to get you out of your comfort zone."
58:18;58:21;"You felt nervous. You don't like to dance, do you?"""
58:21;58:26;"And this happened like 45 minutes earlier, and I was like, ""Yes, you're right."""
58:26;58:28;"And he was like, ""It's good to get out of your comfort zone."""
58:28;58:31;"And then I was like, ""Okay, bye."" I kind of walked away."
58:31;58:34;"And I realized that if he noticed me awkwardly dancing in the corner,"
58:34;58:36;"he's literally seeing everything happening in this party."
58:36;58:39;"He's an all-knowing, all-seeing eye."
58:39;59:08;"[Rapping]"
59:37;59:50;"[Rapping]"
59:50;01:00:19;"[Rapping]"
01:01:46;01:02:11;"[Rapping]"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"That was Yumi, him and her."
01:02:13;01:02:15;"You're listing the time crisis with us."
01:02:15;01:02:17;"You're going to say that right after."
01:02:17;01:02:23;"You're listening to Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig, Despot."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"I'll be your guest."
01:02:25;01:02:26;"What's going on, man?"
01:02:26;01:02:27;"I don't know what I'm talking about."
01:02:27;01:02:29;"No, no, no. Your voice sounds scratchy."
01:02:29;01:02:36;"So then, after all your early hits, was the real game changer Amy Winehouse?"
01:02:36;01:02:41;"That was the first thing that I did that was actually a hit, that was successful."
01:02:41;01:02:43;"I mean, I'd done some stuff with Lillian."
01:02:43;01:02:47;"So when you die, we know it's going to happen one day."
01:02:47;01:02:50;"When you die, do you think, and they're writing about your first hit,"
01:02:50;01:02:53;"you would want them to say it was Amy Winehouse?"
01:02:53;01:02:56;"I think that would be the right, the fair thing to say for sure."
01:02:56;01:03:00;"Because then you slam dunked back-to-back that, and then that first Mark,"
01:03:00;01:03:01;"or no, second Mark Ronson album?"
01:03:01;01:03:02;"Second Mark Ronson album."
01:03:02;01:03:06;"That had the Radiohead cover and the Smiths song."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"The covers and Valerie and stuff."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"Was that peak Mark Ronson?"
01:03:10;01:03:18;"I think it was definitely big time, maybe just in England, but it was like, yeah."
01:03:18;01:03:21;"Is that when people started like, with you on the streets?"
01:03:21;01:03:24;"I've never had that. I never get really chased to stubs."
01:03:24;01:03:27;"I might get like a kind of like a nod, like, hey."
01:03:27;01:03:28;"Like the tunes."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"A double take?"
01:03:29;01:03:30;"Exactly."
01:03:30;01:03:33;"Wait, wait, wait. Really? I was just thinking about this."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"This actually is a question I have."
01:03:34;01:03:38;"So, Uptown Funk now is one of the biggest songs of all time."
01:03:38;01:03:40;"Technically it is actually."
01:03:40;01:03:42;"Yeah, no, I'm not blowing smoke. It's a great song."
01:03:42;01:03:43;"It's one of the biggest songs of all time."
01:03:43;01:03:48;"And even though a lot of people are obviously always going to think of it as a Bruno Mars song."
01:03:48;01:03:49;"Sure."
01:03:49;01:03:53;"You're still in this video that's been viewed how many times? A billion?"
01:03:53;01:03:56;"No, not near that, but a lot."
01:03:56;01:04:00;"One of the biggest songs of all time. I'm sitting here with Mark Ronson."
01:04:01;01:04:05;"This shit, that ice cold Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold."
01:04:05;01:04:09;"This one for them hood girls, them good girls. Straight masterpiece."
01:04:09;01:04:13;"Stylin', wildin', livin' it up in the city."
01:04:13;01:04:17;"Got trucks on with Saint Laurent. Gotta kiss myself, I'm so pretty."

01:26:35;01:26:37;"What's going on in New York, Despot?"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"My cleaning lady saw a dead body yesterday."
01:26:39;01:26:40;"- What do you got, Desus?"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"- We just got a new technology in the Bronx"
01:26:42;01:26:43;"called ShotSpotter."
01:26:43;01:26:44;"You heard about that?"
01:26:44;01:26:45;"- Huh, ShotSpotter."
01:26:45;01:26:47;"- Basically, it's like, they put it up on a lamppost,"
01:26:47;01:26:50;"and if you fire a gunshot, it triangulates your position"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"and it calls the cops."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"- Oh, man."
01:26:53;01:26:54;"- And someone got caught."
01:26:54;01:26:56;"- Wait, wait, so the cops are putting this up?"
01:26:56;01:26:56;"- Yeah, the cops--"
01:26:56;01:26:57;"- No, that's not us."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"(laughing)"
01:26:58;01:27:01;"There was no Kickstarter for this, in my head."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"- It sounds like an app."
01:27:02;01:27:03;"- Yeah, ShotSpotter."
01:27:03;01:27:05;"- Download it, download it now, ShotSpotter."
01:27:05;01:27:08;"But yeah, they arrested the first people they caught,"
01:27:08;01:27:09;"because where they put it first, in the Bronx,"
01:27:09;01:27:10;"of course, is where trouble was."
01:27:10;01:27:12;"And they arrested two people"
01:27:12;01:27:14;"who were just sitting on a bench."
01:27:14;01:27:15;"Apparently, they were bored"
01:27:15;01:27:16;"and just fired off a shot for no reason,"
01:27:16;01:27:17;"'cause they didn't realize the technology"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"had been in place, so now,"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"they're gonna be the first people on Rikers Island"
01:27:21;01:27:22;"caught by this technology."
01:27:22;01:27:23;"- For shooting a cloud."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"Yo, shout out to dudes that would come out for no reason"
01:27:25;01:27:26;"and just make the whole block mad."
01:27:26;01:27:27;"- It was hot for no reason."
01:27:27;01:27:28;"- For no reason."
01:27:28;01:27:29;"We all chilling with you."
01:27:29;01:27:30;"You got the little fake hibachi grill"
01:27:30;01:27:31;"on deck in front of the building."
01:27:31;01:27:32;"We got a little ball."
01:27:32;01:27:33;"A little hookah action going on."
01:27:33;01:27:34;"- You know what I'm saying?"
01:27:34;01:27:35;"A little hookah, a little brandy."
01:27:35;01:27:36;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:27:36;01:27:37;"And then here comes--"
01:27:37;01:27:38;"- Here comes Tito with the big .45."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"- Oh, man."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"Here comes Tito with the, ""Papa!"""
01:27:40;01:27:41;"Yo, she's hot, right?"
01:27:41;01:27:42;"Nah, it's not hot, dog."
01:27:42;01:27:45;"All the girls left, and now the cops are gonna come."
01:27:45;01:27:47;"- I think it cost them like 185 million."
01:27:47;01:27:49;"- So people are shooting randomly in the Bronx"
01:27:49;01:27:50;"more than anywhere else?"
01:27:50;01:27:51;"Is that--"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"- I think people shoot in general, probably."
01:27:52;01:27:53;"- Well, it's debatable."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"- Queens ain't shooting like the Bronx, though."
01:27:55;01:27:56;"Like, if you go in the Bronx right now,"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"you look around and be like, ""Is this 1985?"""
01:27:58;01:28:00;"I mean, the Bronx is so wild."
01:28:00;01:28:03;"Like, if you invite, like, say I invited my boy to this,"
01:28:03;01:28:04;"he wouldn't be like, ""What's the dress code?"
01:28:04;01:28:05;"""Where is it located?"""
01:28:05;01:28:06;"He'd be like, ""Yo."""
01:28:06;01:28:07;"- I gotta bring the burner?"
01:28:07;01:28:08;"- They got metal detectors?"
01:28:08;01:28:08;"(laughing)"
01:28:08;01:28:09;"Like, that's the question you ask"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"before you go out in the Bronx?"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"- Yeah, I tried the L's."
01:28:13;01:28:18;"- You're listening to Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:28:18;01:28:22;"- So, you guys are absolutely a part of New York culture,"
01:28:22;01:28:24;"but beyond that, y'all some big music fans?"
01:28:24;01:28:25;"- Oh, yeah. - Huge."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"- Love it."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"- And so we figured, who better than you"
01:28:27;01:28:30;"to kinda traverse the pop culture landscape with?"
01:28:30;01:28:33;"So, we're gonna go through the top five"
01:28:33;01:28:34;"singles on iTunes now."
01:28:34;01:28:35;"- Oh, man, let's do it."
01:28:35;01:28:36;"- I bet you know some of them."
01:28:36;01:28:37;"I don't know if you know all of them."
01:28:37;01:28:38;"I don't even know if I know all of them."
01:28:38;01:28:40;"We're gonna go through and, of course,"
01:28:40;01:28:44;"starting with top five, reverse, reverse."
01:28:44;01:28:44;"So, this is with number five."
01:28:44;01:28:47;"So, this song actually, it's by OMI, O-M-I."
01:28:47;01:28:50;"It's the Felix, Jan, or John remix,"
01:28:50;01:28:51;"and it's called ""Cheerleader."""
01:28:51;01:28:53;"This was a big hit in Europe"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"and most of the world last summer,"
01:28:55;01:28:56;"but in the US, it always takes a minute."
01:28:56;01:28:59;"So, this is now finally becoming a hit in the US."

01:29:21;01:29:23;"Mero, yay or nay?"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"- Damn, it sounds like I got flip-flops on"
01:29:25;01:29:28;"and I just put Molly in my butt."
01:29:28;01:29:28;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:29:28;01:29:30;"- In other words, happy."
01:29:30;01:29:32;"- Like a happy, yeah, like a happy, my toes out,"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"you can see my hairy toe knuckles."
01:29:34;01:29:36;"- Oh wait, have any of you guys heard this song before?"
01:29:36;01:29:37;"- I heard this for the first time."
01:29:37;01:29:38;"- I heard the beat."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"- I literally heard this for the first time yesterday."
01:29:39;01:29:40;"- Oh, really?"
01:29:40;01:29:41;"- And I was just like, what is this?"
01:29:41;01:29:42;"I was like, like--"
01:29:42;01:29:43;"- It piqued your curiosity?"
01:29:43;01:29:44;"- Yeah, I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa."
01:29:44;01:29:46;"- I mean, it kinda sounds like a hit."
01:29:46;01:29:47;"- You know, it sounds like Kelly Kapowski"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"on like an African safari."
01:29:49;01:29:49;"- Yeah."
01:29:50;01:29:52;"- Okay, so that was OMI number five."
01:29:52;01:29:54;"Number four, Walk the Moon."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"Any of you guys know who Walk the Moon is?"
01:29:56;01:29:57;"- No."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"- Michael Jackson?"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"- Walk the Moon is a band, oh actually,"
01:30:00;01:30:01;"Maryland, take a look at this."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"Look how they write their name, number four."

01:30:53;01:30:55;"and just mad coupon started raining down"
01:30:55;01:30:56;"from the ceiling. - Just raining down,"
01:30:56;01:30:58;"right? - Like, yo, this is--"

01:31:07;01:31:09;"- Jimmy Buffett? - Jimmy Buffett."
01:31:09;01:31:11;"Like, some dorky dude at a wedding,"
01:31:11;01:31:14;"he would be dancing and singing that to his girl"
01:31:14;01:31:15;"while he's dancing to it and staring at her eye."
01:31:15;01:31:16;"- Shut up and dance with me."
01:31:16;01:31:17;"- You mean like shut up and dance with me?"
01:31:17;01:31:20;"- It's a little aggro to say shut up and dance with me."
01:31:20;01:31:23;"Actually, well, I met some people from Walk the Moon."
01:31:23;01:31:24;"I like them. - Shut up and dance."
01:31:24;01:31:25;"- I'm not gonna slander them,"
01:31:25;01:31:27;"but I appreciate you guys being honest."
01:31:27;01:31:28;"- I mean, that's, the thing is,"
01:31:28;01:31:30;"that song, I can see the appeal."
01:31:30;01:31:31;"That's gonna be a big song."
01:31:31;01:31:33;"- All right, well, that was Walk the Moon."

01:32:32;01:32:33;"- Oh. - That's a fight song."
01:32:33;01:32:35;"- That's crazy. - That's like the old CW."
01:32:35;01:32:37;"- The strong white girl, she's packing up the car"
01:32:37;01:32:38;"to go to NYU."
01:32:38;01:32:41;"She leaves her small town, she has a guitar over her shoulder."
01:32:41;01:32:42;"She's like, ""I'm gonna show you guys."

01:32:50;01:32:51;"- He is."
01:32:51;01:32:52;"He probably is. - He might be,"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"but I don't know."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"'Cause he's on Kazaa trying to download this shit"

01:34:28;01:34:29;"- I was gonna say, it's almost like"
01:34:29;01:34:30;"you can't talk shit about this song"
01:34:30;01:34:33;"because it makes it seem like you're laughing at Paul Walker."
01:34:33;01:34:34;"- But this might be right."
01:34:34;01:34:36;"- Luckily, it's all lame, okay?"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"- We're wildly disrespectful, living or dead."
01:34:38;01:34:40;"This song is, come on, man."
01:34:40;01:34:41;"- I mean, Paul Walker didn't write it."
01:34:41;01:34:42;"- He didn't write it, you hear it?"
01:34:42;01:34:43;"- No, I'm saying, you might be right."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"He might be looking down and saying--"
01:34:45;01:34:46;"- Like, nah, chill."
01:34:46;01:34:47;"Yo, come on, man."
01:34:47;01:34:49;"He's like, yo, let me get some Ferguson, man."
01:34:49;01:34:50;"- You know what the worst part is?"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"He's up in heaven, and I'm sure they play this"
01:34:52;01:34:53;"in the waiting area."
01:34:53;01:34:54;"He has to hear it all day."
01:34:54;01:34:56;"He's like, ah, come on, man."
01:34:56;01:34:59;"- Well, but what do we think about Wiz Khalifa, generally?"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"- He's just like a high giraffe with a lot of tattoos,"
01:35:01;01:35:02;"so I rock with him."
01:35:02;01:35:03;"- Yo, he does like, you know what's crazy?"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"He does a lot of stuff."
01:35:05;01:35:06;"I can't even hate on him, 'cause he does some stuff"
01:35:06;01:35:07;"that I'm like, yo, this is whack,"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"but then he does enough stuff that I'm like,"
01:35:09;01:35:12;"yo, I enjoy listening to this, driving my heart."
01:35:12;01:35:13;"- And he hasn't reached the point in his career"
01:35:13;01:35:14;"where he only makes songs like this."
01:35:14;01:35:15;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:35:15;01:35:17;"- That might help."
01:35:17;01:35:18;"- Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
01:35:18;01:35:19;"That's why I'm saying it was an Eminem song,"
01:35:19;01:35:20;"'cause Eminem is doing wild guidance,"
01:35:20;01:35:21;"counseling, and motivation."
01:35:21;01:35:22;"- 'Cause you know he's gonna make this song,"
01:35:22;01:35:23;"he's gonna make mad money off of this,"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"but he's still gonna drop 24 Taylor Gang songs"
01:35:25;01:35:26;"about smoking weed."
01:35:27;01:35:29;"(laughing)"
01:35:29;01:35:30;"- Wait, so I just wanna say, so far,"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"out of the top five--"
01:35:32;01:35:34;"- Like the Disney reggae track."
01:35:34;01:35:35;"(laughing)"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"- That was the only one that it seems like anybody liked."
01:35:37;01:35:38;"- How great is ""S.L.G.O.A.D.A.B."""
01:35:38;01:35:40;"what it's like in the trailer for an animated show"
01:35:40;01:35:41;"with Jamaican penguins?"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"- Oh, yo, we're just like, ""My cheerleader!"""
01:35:43;01:35:44;"- It totally is."
01:35:44;01:35:45;"- Oh, man."
01:35:45;01:35:46;"- Wait, but I just wanna backtrack."
01:35:46;01:35:48;"Desmond, did you think that ""Cheerleader"" sucked?"
01:35:48;01:35:50;"- It's the winner."
01:35:50;01:35:51;"- Okay, it's the winner so far."
01:35:51;01:35:52;"- It's the winner of the music section."
01:35:52;01:35:54;"- But hold on, it's such a candy dance hall, though."
01:35:54;01:35:55;"It's so corny."
01:35:55;01:35:56;"- Okay, but hold on, number one,"
01:35:56;01:35:59;"this is a song from a very big album,"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"but it got a little remix, a little guest verse."
01:36:01;01:36:04;"So this is number one on iTunes currently."
01:36:04;01:36:05;"I don't know if it's the number one song in the country,"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"but probably."
01:36:07;01:36:09;"Taylor Swift, ""Bad Blood,"" featuring who?"
