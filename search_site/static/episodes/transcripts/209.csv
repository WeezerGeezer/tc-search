00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis back again. On today's episode we're joined by Dave Maklovich"
00:08;00:18;"to talk gift-giving. Plus we listen to new music from Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign."
00:18;00:27;"All that plus the greatest foreigner song of all time. This is Time Crisis with Ezra"
00:27;00:30;"Koenig."
01:15;01:20;"Time Crisis back again. Boy we got so much on the docket. Breaking news,"
01:20;01:25;"Seinfeld and I just found out that Jake and Nick have another crew called the"
01:25;01:32;"Lunch Boys. Yeah what the f*ck. Side crew. Sound the alarm. I mean, well first of all, I think, have we"
01:32;01:41;"discussed this on the program? Every grown man needs at least two crews. Now"
01:41;01:46;"some people might define that as like a text thread. Ideally you have three and I"
01:46;01:50;"know this probably sounds like a lot but guys there's a loneliness epidemic out"
01:50;01:57;"there. So to keep your head above water you really you need a lot of you need a"
01:57;02:01;"lot of text threads and a lot of crews because you never know which one might"
02:01;02:07;"go dormant for a year. We had another text, do you remember we had one Ezra, with a"
02:07;02:12;"bunch of dudes I never met that you put on. We remember we were the, are the"
02:12;02:17;"steppers, the hot steppers. Oh yeah that didn't last very long. But when it lasted"
02:17;02:20;"it was funny that was just about how many steps all of us had taken that day."
02:20;02:24;"Right, that had a moment. But look everybody needs multiple crews. It was"
02:24;02:28;"just surprising for me and Seinfeld to hear that you guys had a crew called"
02:28;02:33;"Lunch Boys. This is a shocker. I do have a, I do have a group with just Jake where"
02:33;02:37;"sometimes we'll occasionally text each other about like TV shows and stuff."
02:37;02:43;"It's true. Does that count? Wait it's, who's in the group? Just you and Jake? It's just me and Jake."
02:43;02:48;"Sometimes, no that, of course it doesn't count. But it's a crew of two. That's two men"
02:48;02:54;"texting each other. We went pretty deep on the curse, me and Seinfeld over text."
02:54;03:01;"Right well that sucks because that feels like that could have gone into the TC."
03:01;03:06;"Actually me and Nick are on a different text thread that has a lot of curse stuff. Yeah"
03:06;03:11;"we're on one with uh... With Blackbird Spy Plane. But look it's important to have"
03:11;03:16;"different splinter cells. Okay but anyway and also it's one thing to say oh yeah"
03:16;03:20;"I have a text thread with the handful of people that sometimes it is about like"
03:20;03:25;"the most random sh*t ever. I mean technically it's very dormant but Jake, Jake and I"
03:25;03:32;"have a crew, have a Pearl Jam crew with Adam from We're On Drugs who we've both"
03:32;03:40;"met once and and then my dear friend and colleague Brian who we work with very"
03:40;03:46;"closely. That's a great thread I think we should uh resurrect that Pearl Jam thread."
03:46;03:49;"Well there's got to be some good Pearl Jam news. Seinfeld can you just do a"
03:49;03:53;"quick search has there been any good Pearl Jam news lately? My brother texted"
03:53;03:58;"me that there's a new Pearl Jam single that sounds like mid-period Fugazi"
03:58;04:02;"specifically in on the killtaker. Okay. Maybe we should throw that on because I"
04:02;04:06;"have not heard this new PJ. Let's listen to it so we both have something to talk"
04:06;04:09;"about on the text thread."
04:50;04:57;"I don't know if I have but it makes it feel way more official. I like that part."
04:57;05:00;"The little Zeppelin descending riff."
05:11;05:15;"Thread's dead for like two years. Yeah. Adam what do you think of the new Pearl Jam"
05:15;05:25;"single? I'm feeling it I'm kind of hearing a Fugazi influence. You with me dog?"
05:25;05:33;"All right I've heard enough. Yeah I'm not I'm not vibing with this Pearl Jam right now."
05:33;05:44;"I mean it's not bad. It's a terrible drum sound. At least through like my ear buds on the laptop it's rough stuff."
05:44;05:49;"Okay but so the Lunch Boys is a group of guys who gets lunch together?"
05:49;05:56;"Well yeah I think I was saying right before we started that I think we've convened twice in about three years."
05:56;06:04;"It's me, Nick, friend of the show Michael Schmeling and then an artist named Freddie Kunath."
06:04;06:10;"Right and Schmeling is a photographer. He actually took a lot of the new Vampire Weekend press pictures."
06:10;06:15;"Oh wow. That's right. I did not know that. If you caught any of those."
06:15;06:19;"All right so I feel like this is this is kind of like the arts crew. A little bit."
06:19;06:29;"Although Nick is this chameleonic figure just weaving his way through the worlds of music, television and fine art."
06:29;06:36;"I guess I'm just sort of a connector. Nick's got a lot of items to fire."
06:36;06:43;"I'm just trying to tie the binds. But you know. Nick's taking five percent. Nick's my manager."
06:43;06:51;"But I do feel that it wouldn't be unusual to throw anyone in this crew into the Lunch Boys."
06:51;06:59;"It did start as a way that I have you know two close friends who are painters. Jake and Freddie."
06:59;07:04;"And they were actually there was a moment where they were starting to work with the same gallery."
07:04;07:08;"And I was like oh you guys and Freddie was there. We should or vice versa should meet each other."
07:08;07:12;"So I was like oh let's all go to lunch. And then the text thread sort of took off."
07:12;07:15;"I think from there and planning this lunch. That's the way to do it."
07:15;07:20;"And then Jake and Schmeling are both diehard Steve Forbert fans. Yes."
07:20;07:27;"So that is true. Forbert crew. I've been wearing I've been rocking that Steve Forbert shirt a lot recently."
07:27;07:29;"Have we talked about it on the show. I don't know if we talked about it."
07:29;07:34;"Well I feel like we talked about it in an episode that will air later after this episode."
07:34;07:42;"Oh that's going to be confusing for people. I really messed up. I bought Christmas gifts for the whole crew."
07:42;07:48;"I sent our producer Matt the Guy Fieri Christmas garbage can. It's a good one."
07:48;07:56;"And then for the on air talent I got some T-shirts that I thought felt right for for each guy."
07:56;08:01;"So Jake's is probably the best which was a vintage Steve Forbert T-shirt."
08:01;08:05;"And it's got all the vibe of like what exactly what you would hope of it."
08:05;08:10;"Steve Forbert T-shirt looks like. And Jake tried it on and it was a perfect fit."
08:10;08:17;"And it's yeah it's a legit beautiful design. Plain white tee with just a black and white photographic full body image."
08:17;08:23;"You former student and then just in red all caps lettering Steve Forbert."
08:23;08:30;"Wait actually it's so tight. But I want Nick and Seinfeld I want to show you the shirts that I got you guys because it's been sitting here."
08:30;08:35;"Like Seinfeld you came over for my Super Bowl party and remember when you said I said remind me I got something for you."
08:35;08:39;"But then of course you know we were so caught up in the game."
08:39;08:46;"I remembered it on my way out too. It was a great game. Yeah I remembered it on the way out and then I was like s***."
08:46;08:54;"Yeah. I just want to show you guys now so that because we're like two months out from when I should have given it to you."
08:54;08:59;"I feel like as long as you get to shirts by like July 4th weekend then we're good."
08:59;09:04;"I think our listeners might appreciate this because I got you some little stocking stuffers too."
09:04;09:11;"OK but I saw this shirt. It's a beautiful blue shirt but I don't know who I thought this would be for."
09:11;09:18;"I think I kind of pictured this one was for Nick initially but when it came I'm like this is going to fit Seinfeld better."
09:18;09:28;"And it's a very cozy feels like an early 80s shirt. A really nice been you can tell it's been washed a thousand times."
09:28;09:35;"Light blue shirt. Let's see. Can you guys read it if I hold it up. Hold it up. Oh Seinfeld."
09:35;09:43;"So much text. All right. First I was a good boy. Then I became a nice kid. After that I was a great guy."
09:43;09:53;"Later I grew to be a fine man. Now I'm just an old fart. So that one's for Seinfeld."
09:53;10:00;"And that's got Seinfeld coffee shop challenge. Yeah. You're going to be wearing that to work and everything."
10:00;10:06;"And then I think maybe initially I thought that one would be for Nick but it was like maybe I got the sizing wrong."
10:06;10:11;"And then the one that this one is so random. This is a pretty cool vintage shirt."
10:11;10:21;"But basically it's a interesting drawing of a cyclist. And it's OK. That's sick. Does it say anything."
10:21;10:28;"Yeah it says Montreal Canada on the bottom. I think. Oh well obviously obviously that was for Seinfeld."
10:28;10:32;"Yeah. But you know what. It was meant to be because this one I think will fit you better."
10:32;10:38;"And the old fart one will fit Seinfeld better. So then. And to be honest that may have been too on the nose."
10:38;10:45;"You know and also it's funny looking back. I clearly when you got to buy gifts for a crew."
10:45;10:54;"I don't know if you run into this problem with the lunch boys but when you have to buy gifts for a crew it's really hard to nail each person like 100 percent."
10:54;11:01;"And I felt like when I found this vintage C4 bird shirt for Jake I was just like this feels so right."
11:01;11:05;"It's perfect for Jake. And I've always had a hard time. I've had a hard time with gift giving."
11:05;11:11;"People could turn it around and say I'm a Scrooge. There's times I probably didn't buy a gift when I should have."
11:11;11:20;"In my mind it's because I care a little too much. And I do I do really freeze up when I'm about to buy somebody a mid gift."
11:20;11:27;"And so anyway I nailed it so hard with Jake and then I found the old fart shirt and I was like oh maybe Nick will find that funny."
11:27;11:38;"And I was left with Seinfeld. Just like that's how insane I was just like late night on eBay like vintage Montreal shirt."
11:38;11:41;"So it's all for the best that Nick will get the Montreal shirt."
11:41;11:44;"I love it. It's very thoughtful of you Ezra. It means a lot. Yeah. Thank you."
11:44;11:51;"My pleasure. I think I I mean I guess like anybody I do love giving giving a gift if it feels right."
11:51;11:59;"If there's like something that feels a little fun about it or somehow connected to some the relationship."
11:59;12:06;"But you know like when you're under the gun to get a gift even if it's somebody like a dear friend somebody you really care about."
12:06;12:12;"It could be kind of a painful feeling. You're just like standing there and you're just like am I really about to buy this dude a candle."
12:12;12:22;"Like oh God. You know what I mean. Like I can't show up empty handed and yet part of my brain is screaming better to give nothing than to buy this dumb book."
12:22;12:26;"That's just going to clutter up their house. You know you want to know."
12:26;12:30;"Meet me in the middle of the day. Let me hear you say everything's OK."
12:30;12:36;"Bring me southern kisses from your room."
12:36;12:41;"Meet me in the middle of the night. Let me hear you say everything's all right."
12:41;12:45;"Let me smell the moon in your perfume."
12:45;12:52;"Oh God's. Lost in talk."
12:52;12:55;"Waste my time and it's all been said before."
12:55;13:01;"While further down behind the masquerade the tears of the."
13:01;13:05;"I don't ask for all that much. I just want someone."
13:05;13:14;"I think one of the first times we met I gave you something."
13:14;13:21;"I don't know if you remember this. I'm guessing it was Seinfeld related but it was a DVD copy of the B movie."
13:21;13:25;"Yeah. And I was sort of in but 20."
13:25;13:36;"14 15. And I remember you seemed a little nonplussed. You see the little like. Well I'm not going to I'm not going to watch this but I think you appreciated it."
13:36;13:43;"Yeah I think probably I was no longer buying DVDs at that moment in my life. I think the medium. Yeah."
13:43;13:51;"Was a little that that would actually be a cool. But I do like it especially now. It'd be cool to just start getting people DVDs all the time."
13:51;14:00;"Oh yeah. They're back. They're back. Breaking Bad season three DVD box set. Very cool."
14:00;14:07;"Just a used season three Breaking Bad box set would be pretty sick."
14:07;14:12;"It's going to take up a fair amount of space on the shelf and look terrible."
14:12;14:17;"Yeah. Well remember they used to do like video box sets. Oh yeah. Oh yeah."
14:17;14:25;"Those I have that I have that for Twin Peaks. The whole Twin Peaks box set. You know it's like eight or something six of them."
14:25;14:31;"I mean that's actually cool. Well D.V. I mean Seinfeld wasn't lying. I mean DVDs are coming back."
14:31;14:36;"Look how hard vinyl came back. DVDs are coming. I mean yeah vinyl is huge. Yeah."
14:36;14:47;"Oh by the way I should say go to www.vampireweekend.com and you can preorder The Only God Was Above Us vinyl which is very beautiful."
14:47;14:55;"With photos by Lunch Boy Michael Schmeling. Oh yeah. Well yeah. There's actually yeah on the inside there's some photos from Schmeling."
14:55;15:03;"You can get it in black or clear vinyl. And you know what actually is crazy? We did this like CD box set that I actually think looks sick."
15:03;15:12;"What do you mean box set? It's like you can it comes with a T-shirt but it's a I think it's a cardboard box that has like the album cover printed on it."
15:12;15:20;"And inside you get like a T-shirt with one of the Steven Seagal images plus the CD. And actually like I still I still love CDs."
15:20;15:27;"I have a CD player in the house and I was actually really you know obviously we put so much work into primarily thinking about the LP."
15:27;15:33;"But then it still is fun kind of like thinking about the CD and what image goes on the CD."
15:33;15:44;"And like I still get really hyped when I see like the they call it the OB strip which is the thing they wrap the cardboard piece that they wrap around the side in Japan."
15:44;15:51;"All right. Like when I get when I get like a picture of it and it has information about the band and of course text in Japanese."
15:51;15:57;"I still get hyped about the Japanese CD version. So don't count out CDs either."
15:57;16:05;"Where'd you guys press the vinyl? You know I mean offhand. It's all over the world. That's about really great."
16:05;16:14;"Yeah it's not just one plant in like Pittsburgh pumping out like tens of thousands of Vampire Weekend I think records."
16:14;16:25;"That's an interesting question. I know that Columbia uses plants all over the world because I was talking to the dude who's the head of physical production."
16:25;16:37;"And he was telling me that and this is kind of like a famous story that his first week on the job or at least his first week of being in charge of production"
16:37;16:46;"was the week that some insane number of Beyonce records were printed with Side B being a death metal album."
16:46;16:47;"Amazing."
16:47;16:50;"This is like in the news. I don't think I'm like blowing up any spots."
16:50;16:54;"I missed the story. What are those going for on eBay?"
16:54;17:01;"Yes it's funny like I'm sure at the time everybody was like what a nightmare and then in retrospect it's like oh I wish I had that."
17:01;17:07;"Do you know how many were pressed or would you rather not say? I'm just curious."
17:07;17:13;"I remember I mean the way the guy told the story he was like it was a big number it was crazy and I remember I think those were pressed in Europe."
17:13;17:15;"That's my vague memory of the story."
17:15;17:22;"Yeah German record pressing plant lemonade filled with punk songs after factory error."
17:22;17:36;"Thanks to a human error at Celebrate Records vinyl pressing plant in Germany uphill battle an album by Ontario band Zex was pressed onto the lemon yellow vinyl instead
of lemonade tracks."
17:36;17:40;"It doesn't say how many in the Guardian here were made."
17:40;17:48;"Quote Zex guitarist saying a lot of them had said oh I like the surprise I got on the other side it's good music even though it's not what they paid for."
17:48;17:53;"Do you know how many were pressed of The Vampire?"
17:53;17:56;"Don't know."
17:56;17:57;"No idea."
17:57;18:01;"Fascinating like anticipated album by a big band."
18:01;18:07;"It's like are you pressing 20,000 100,000 I have no idea."
18:07;18:15;"Yeah and you don't want to like run out either and I know there's and then we think there's special ones with different we did like a clear vinyl."
18:15;18:20;"And there's going to be this indie store exclusive with a different cover which looks sick."
18:20;18:23;"I'm a black vinyl guy personally."
18:23;18:24;"Just basic black."
18:24;18:25;"Classic."

19:40;19:43;"Frog on the Bass Drum, volume one and volume two."

19:45;19:48;"So those are printed in Preston, Tennessee."
19:48;19:49;"- Tight."
19:49;19:52;"Is Third Man, is that the Jack White thing?"
19:52;19:52;"- Yeah. - Yeah, yeah."
19:52;19:54;"- Yeah, he's, yeah, Jack White owns it."
19:54;19:57;"- Did you interface directly with Jack about this project?"
19:57;19:58;"- No."
19:58;20:02;"I have met Jack briefly over the years."
20:02;20:03;"Always seemed like a nice guy."
20:03;20:06;"- We went to a show of his, you and I,"
20:06;20:09;"God, five, six years ago."
20:09;20:11;"- Wait, that was like in downtown LA?"
20:11;20:12;"- Yeah, remember?"
20:12;20:13;"- Yeah."
20:13;20:15;"- Yeah, it was at some little theater downtown."
20:15;20:18;"I remember we met Jude Law backstage."
20:18;20:19;"- Oh yeah."
20:19;20:23;"- And he was like towering over me."
20:23;20:24;"- Really, how tall is he?"
20:24;20:25;"- I don't know, I just remember,"
20:25;20:26;"at least in my memory, you know,"
20:26;20:29;"memory is fallible, but in my memory, I'm like,"
20:29;20:32;"I remember going home like, oh yeah, you know,"
20:32;20:35;"I met Jude Law tonight at this backstage with Ezra"
20:35;20:37;"at this Jack White show and he was,"
20:37;20:38;"in my head, he's a giant."
20:38;20:40;"Wait, how tall is he, Nick?"
20:40;20:42;"- He's 6'7""."
20:42;20:43;"- No, he's not. - No, because--"
20:43;20:43;"- Really?"
20:43;20:45;"- No, I know Jude a bit."
20:45;20:46;"- He's 5'10""."
20:46;20:47;"- What?"
20:47;20:49;"- See, that's--"
20:49;20:50;"(laughing)"
20:50;20:51;"- That's what the circus is for folks."
20:51;20:51;"- Jude is not a giant."
20:51;20:54;"- He has such tall guy energy, so much confidence."
20:54;20:55;"- He's not short."
20:55;20:57;"- He's 5'10""."
20:57;20:58;"- I'm 5'9""."
20:58;20:59;"- I think you're taller than him."
20:59;21:01;"- No, I don't think so."
21:01;21:04;"That's, folks, that's why they call him movie stars,"
21:04;21:05;"'cause I went home and I was like,"
21:05;21:07;"that guy was just a Greek god."
21:07;21:09;"- It's so funny, I--"
21:09;21:11;"- Also, you were reacting to the fact"
21:11;21:13;"that he's a handsome, charismatic man."
21:13;21:15;"- I think he was wearing like a nice suit."
21:15;21:17;"Again, this is my like--"
21:17;21:18;"- He's your height."
21:18;21:23;"- I was probably wearing like a cruddy, like polar fleece."
21:24;21:25;"- Wait, who is this?"
21:25;21:26;"Who are we talking about?"
21:26;21:27;"- Jude Law."
21:27;21:28;"- Jude Law, ah, Jude Law."
21:28;21:29;"- This is so random."
21:29;21:30;"- Great actor."
21:30;21:31;"- Great actor."
21:31;21:32;"- Phenomenal."
21:32;21:33;"- I'm just saying--"
21:33;21:34;"- Giant."
21:34;21:34;"- Young pope."
21:34;21:35;"- Jack White came up and I was like,"
21:35;21:38;"oh yeah, I remember going to a Jack White show"
21:38;21:39;"with Ezra and Jude Law."
21:39;21:41;"- Wait, but you know, Jack White's pretty tall."
21:41;21:42;"- Is he?"
21:42;21:45;"- I don't think we talked to him that night."
21:45;21:46;"- Jack White is 6'2""."
21:46;21:47;"- Yep."
21:47;21:49;"- Okay, that's a good height."
21:49;21:51;"- Okay, well there's also an obvious thing"
21:51;21:55;"that kinda transcends energy, which is posture."
21:55;21:57;"Like if somebody gets their posture right,"
21:57;22:00;"they literally are towering above you more."
22:00;22:01;"You know what's funny though?"
22:01;22:04;"There's like a famous thing in Vampire Weekend"
22:04;22:08;"because in the current three official member"
22:08;22:11;"of Vampire Weekend, if you can believe it,"
22:11;22:14;"I'm the shortest member at six feet."
22:14;22:15;"- I believe it."
22:15;22:18;"- So people always come and say like, wow, tall band."
22:18;22:19;"- Truly."
22:19;22:22;"- And so CT and Bayo are, I don't know,"
22:22;22:25;"they're like within, they're close."
22:25;22:26;"Don't quote me on the numbers,"
22:26;22:30;"but maybe somebody's 6'2 1/4 and somebody's 6'3"","
22:30;22:33;"like, or somebody's 6'2 1/2."
22:33;22:36;"But anyway, as you can imagine,"
22:36;22:40;"if you get like two people who are above six feet"
22:40;22:41;"and they have the same name,"
22:41;22:44;"many times over the years people say,"
22:44;22:46;"oh, which one of you is taller?"
22:46;22:48;"It looks like CT's taller."
22:48;22:51;"And famously the answer is no, Bayo's taller."
22:51;22:53;"Bayo's the tallest one in the band."
22:53;22:55;"And so they kind of have like a bit about it,"
22:55;22:57;"like when they're pretending,"
22:57;22:58;"like they're answering that question"
22:58;22:59;"for the millionth time."
22:59;23:00;"And they're just like, yeah, yeah, yeah,"
23:00;23:02;"he carries himself with more,"
23:02;23:04;"he carries himself differently."
23:04;23:06;"- CT has got excellent posture."
23:06;23:09;"- CT's got excellent posture and you know,"
23:09;23:11;"Bayo's like, he's really into running"
23:11;23:13;"and he can run all over town."
23:13;23:15;"CT's always been more of an athlete."
23:15;23:16;"You know, he was like high school,"
23:16;23:18;"captain of the high school basketball team."
23:18;23:22;"So I wonder if also his like athletic nature reads into it"
23:22;23:24;"or because Bayo's taller,"
23:24;23:26;"maybe he slumps a little bit more"
23:26;23:27;"'cause sometimes tall people"
23:27;23:30;"don't wanna be towering over everybody."
23:30;23:33;"So anyway, that's come up many times for people like,"
23:33;23:34;"oh, it looks like he's taller."
23:34;23:38;"Actually, no, he's just got more tall guy energy."
23:38;23:40;"This is the tallest guy."
23:40;23:42;"- If you were to tell me drums or bass,"
23:42;23:44;"which have a taller guy energy,"
23:44;23:45;"I would say drums."
23:45;23:46;"- I would say bass,"
23:46;23:48;"but that's 'cause I'm thinking of Chris Novoselic"
23:48;23:50;"who is two feet taller than Kurt."
23:50;23:54;"- By the way, you know who has,"
23:54;23:57;"not truly not 'cause we have to call him into Segway,"
23:57;24:00;"but you know who has really tall guy energy?"
24:00;24:00;"Is Dave."
24:00;24:02;"- Dave Mclevish."
24:02;24:03;"Lead singer of Chromio."
24:03;24:04;"Let's get him on the horn."
24:04;24:07;"- Now let's go to the time crisis hotline."
24:07;24:12;"- We should ask him how tall he is."
24:12;24:14;"If you were to ask me, I'd say he's 6'2""."
24:14;24:15;"- Yeah, actually, I don't know."
24:15;24:16;"Yeah, I think Dave,"
24:16;24:18;"I think of Dave as being taller than me."
24:18;24:21;"- If you told me he was somehow 5'9"","
24:21;24:23;"I still wouldn't disbelieve it"
24:23;24:24;"'cause I just feel like,"
24:24;24:26;"oh man, this guy presents so tall."
24:26;24:27;"- Yo, yo."
24:27;24:28;"- There he is."
24:28;24:28;"- Hey, what's up?"
24:28;24:30;"- Hi."
24:30;24:32;"- Welcome back to time crisis."
24:32;24:37;"My dear friend and legendary singer of Chromio, DJ, Dave1."
24:37;24:40;"Question number one, how tall are you?"
24:40;24:41;"- 6'4""."
24:41;24:43;"- Whoa, wait."
24:43;24:43;"- Wow."
24:43;24:44;"- What did I say?"
24:44;24:47;"Did I say 6'2"" or 6'4""?"
24:47;24:48;"- You said 6'2""."
24:48;24:50;"- Damn, I told you he was tall."
24:50;24:53;"- We were just talking about, you're 6'4""?"
24:53;24:55;"- Somewhere in between 6'3"" and 6'4"", yeah."
24:55;24:56;"- That's shocking."
24:56;24:58;"Congratulations."
24:58;24:59;"- Thank you, thank you."
24:59;25:01;"- I gotta say, I'm 6'2"" and a bit,"
25:01;25:03;"and it always trips me out"
25:03;25:05;"when someone's a little taller than me"
25:05;25:07;"'cause I'm used to being, you know what I'm saying?"
25:07;25:09;"And I'm like, that's not allowed."
25:09;25:11;"- Sorry."
25:11;25:13;"- Wait, are guys from Montreal tall?"
25:13;25:15;"You're both from Montreal."
25:15;25:17;"(laughing)"
25:17;25:19;"- They come in all shapes."
25:19;25:21;"- Guys from Montreal are not particularly tall."
25:21;25:25;"My mom feels like people in New York are taller."
25:25;25:28;"Whenever she comes to New York,"
25:28;25:30;"she's like, ""Wow, everybody's tall here."""
25:30;25:31;"- I mean, she would know."
25:31;25:34;"Walking the streets of Montreal and then coming to New York."
25:34;25:36;"Maybe New York is a taller city."
25:36;25:39;"And so, were you ever athletic?"
25:39;25:41;"- Never athletic."
25:41;25:41;"- Right, you've always been--"
25:41;25:42;"- Not even close."
25:42;25:44;"- You've always been kind of bookish."
25:44;25:49;"- Bookish, I had this big cycling phase in high school."
25:49;25:51;"That was like a huge thing for me."
25:51;25:56;"And then, I was bookish, I was music-ish."
25:56;25:59;"You know, a little bit of skateboarding"
25:59;26:02;"and then big into cycling and mountain biking."
26:02;26:04;"And that was a phase and it went away."
26:04;26:05;"And then that's about it."
26:05;26:06;"Just music."
26:06;26:08;"- When you're over 6'3"", don't you often get people"
26:08;26:11;"trying to just draft you into basketball?"
26:11;26:12;"- Not when you go to a French lycee"
26:12;26:15;"and there's nothing close to basketball or sports."
26:15;26:16;"- Explain that."
26:16;26:20;"So, a French lycee, this is your Montreal high school?"
26:20;26:21;"- Yeah, high school, yeah."
26:21;26:26;"So, from grade, let's see, grade seven to 11, I guess."
26:26;26:32;"There wasn't really much of any after-school sports programs"
26:32;26:33;"or anything like that."
26:33;26:36;"- And Seinfeld, you went to an English language school?"
26:36;26:37;"- No, no, it was French."
26:37;26:39;"It was a French lycee. - No, no, I'm asking Seinfeld."
26:39;26:41;"I wanna A/B the Montreal experience."
26:41;26:42;"- Oh, Seinfeld, oh, hi, Seinfeld."
26:42;26:44;"- Hey, what's up?"
26:44;26:47;"Yeah, I was in a French immersion school in elementary,"
26:47;26:49;"but yeah."
26:49;26:50;"- You went to an English language high school."
26:50;26:52;"Was your school more like an American school"
26:52;26:57;"with basketball and sports and cheerleaders?"
26:57;26:57;"- Oh, yeah."
26:57;26:59;"- Yeah, we didn't have anything like that."
26:59;27:00;"- Right, it's 'cause, yeah,"
27:00;27:02;"that's always trips me out about Montreal,"
27:02;27:07;"just like alternate linguistic realities, cultural."
27:07;27:10;"- Cultural realities, and ours was even more radical"
27:10;27:15;"'cause it was like French curriculum, French teachers,"
27:15;27:17;"kids from all over the world."
27:17;27:20;"There was very little locals."
27:20;27:21;"- Right, so yours was French language,"
27:21;27:26;"but not particularly the French-Canadian, Quebecois people."
27:26;27:30;"- No, no, maybe one or two per class, that's it."
27:30;27:31;"- Right."
27:31;27:34;"Congratulations on the new album."
27:34;27:35;"- Thank you."
27:35;27:36;"- It's great."
27:36;27:37;"- Thank you."
27:37;27:40;"- You started giving me feedback on it,"
27:40;27:42;"and then you abruptly stopped,"
27:42;27:44;"so I was like, ""Oof, past song number four"
27:44;27:47;"doesn't get that great,"" but thanks for confirming."
27:47;27:48;"- I was past song four."
27:48;27:49;"Yeah, I was just--"
27:49;27:50;"- Five."
27:50;27:53;"- Then I had to go do other stuff."
27:53;27:54;"Great album."
27:54;27:55;"I've already talked on the show"
27:55;27:57;"about my love for ""Personal Effects."""
27:57;27:58;"- Yeah."
27:58;28:01;"- That's an all-time Chromium song for me."
28:01;28:02;"- Thank you."
28:02;28:04;"- Everybody should check out the album."
28:04;28:07;"- It's dicey territory to start giving feedback"
28:07;28:09;"to your close friend."
28:09;28:10;"- That's true, yeah, just recently."
28:10;28:13;"- You know, it's really, you know,"
28:13;28:14;"second half of the record."
28:14;28:15;"- Yeah."
28:15;28:16;"- You left Dave hanging."
28:16;28:18;"- Yeah, I still feel like that."
28:18;28:20;"Ezra, you remember when you played me your album,"
28:20;28:22;"I listened to the whole thing twice."
28:22;28:24;"Whole thing."
28:24;28:25;"And then we talked."
28:25;28:26;"You called me, actually."
28:26;28:30;"You were very, very, very nervous about what I had to say."
28:30;28:31;"But, you know, I figured,"
28:31;28:33;"I know there's a second text coming"
28:33;28:34;"down the line at some point."
28:34;28:36;"- The second text is coming."
28:36;28:38;"- There's a second coming."
28:38;28:41;"- I'm sure you're all talked out about the album."
28:41;28:43;"Like, people listen to ""Time Crisis,"""
28:43;28:45;"they know we love Chromium."
28:45;28:46;"They should go check it out."
28:46;28:48;"Like, you've been all over the world"
28:48;28:50;"promoting the record recently."
28:50;28:52;"About to go back on tour."
28:52;28:53;"- Yeah."
28:53;28:54;"- All over the US."
28:54;28:54;"- Yeah."
28:54;28:56;"- But there was something we were talking--"
28:56;28:57;"- Yeah, tell me, tell me."
28:57;28:59;"No, go on, we're doing Europe too,"
28:59;29:00;"and a little bit of Mexico."
29:00;29:01;"It's gonna be fun."
29:01;29:03;"- Amazing."
29:03;29:05;"I don't know if people understand too,"
29:05;29:08;"that Chromium is one of the great live bands"
29:08;29:10;"of the 21st century."
29:10;29:12;"And actually, I don't know if we ever talked about it"
29:12;29:15;"on the show, you released a live record two years ago."
29:15;29:18;"- Yeah, I mean, playing live is like a big thing with us."
29:18;29:23;"We've always had our share of kind of doubters and skeptics."
29:23;29:28;"And usually when they see us live,"
29:29;29:34;"that's when they become a little converted, I would say."
29:34;29:38;"Or like some of the skepticism, you know, dwindles,"
29:38;29:40;"dissipates, so yeah."
29:40;29:43;"- Yeah, and I think you get a lot of repeat customers"
29:43;29:46;"because the show is so fun."
29:46;29:48;"Like every tour, you always put a lot of thought into it."
29:48;29:51;"And it's like kind of a dance party,"
29:51;29:53;"always like a really cool set."
29:53;29:54;"- Yeah."
29:54;29:55;"- You and Peter are great performers."
29:55;29:57;"- Yeah, a lot gets put into it."
29:57;30:00;"A lot of like set design and yeah,"
30:00;30:04;"we grew up in that era where the show"
30:04;30:06;"is just as important as the music,"
30:06;30:08;"is just as important as the font,"
30:08;30:09;"is just as important as the artwork,"
30:09;30:12;"is just as important as the outfits."
30:12;30:14;"It's like the Ramones,"
30:14;30:17;"like you have to have the whole thing."
30:17;30:18;"- Right."
30:18;30:23;"- I saw you guys live once in the early 2000s, 2007 or so."
30:23;30:25;"And I can attest to everything you're saying"
30:25;30:26;"'cause it was like, it was a true party."
30:26;30:27;"You guys were like, it was very democratic."
30:27;30:31;"You were like with the crowd almost, as I recall."
30:31;30:32;"It was a fun night."
30:32;30:33;"- Was that in Montreal?"
30:33;30:34;"- That was in Toronto."
30:34;30:35;"Toronto, yeah."
30:35;30:37;"- Oh, wow, cool."
30:37;30:39;"Oh, I know where that was."
30:39;30:41;"That was on the second floor of some weird kind of..."
30:41;30:42;"- That's right."
30:42;30:44;"- Oh yeah, that was like, those were the,"
30:44;30:46;"that was peak indie sleaze era."
30:46;30:47;"- Yes, that's right."
30:47;30:48;"That's right."
30:48;30:49;"There was like no stage almost."
30:49;30:50;"- Nope, no stage."
30:50;30:52;"- I just remember, yeah, yeah, yeah."
30:52;30:54;"- Yeah, that was cool."

31:33;31:36;"- One thing we were just talking about earlier, Dave,"
31:36;31:40;"just to really bring you fully into the mix of time crisis,"
31:40;31:43;"which I said recently, for all the Bill Maher fans,"
31:43;31:45;"this is the real club random."
31:45;31:47;"We've been keeping it random since day one."
31:47;31:48;"- Yeah."
31:48;31:51;"- Bill Maher's trying to get random now on Club Random."
31:51;31:53;"But we were just talking about gift giving."
31:53;31:56;"(laughing)"
31:56;31:59;"And how I got all the guys for Christmas,"
31:59;32:03;"the time crisis crew, vintage shirts,"
32:03;32:05;"and I nailed Jake's so well."
32:05;32:07;"I got him a vintage Steve Forbert shirt."
32:07;32:08;"Do you know who that is?"
32:08;32:09;"- No, who's that?"
32:09;32:12;"- He was like a late 70s singer songwriter,"
32:12;32:14;"doing kind of like traditional songwriting,"
32:14;32:15;"but in the era of punk."
32:15;32:17;"And he has this song called ""Romeo's Tune"""
32:17;32:18;"that people like a lot."
32:18;32:20;"But it's a bit random."
32:20;32:21;"So to find like a vintage shirt"
32:21;32:24;"that just says the guy's name, Steve Forbert in red,"
32:24;32:27;"it's like a picture of him, fit Jake perfectly."
32:27;32:29;"But then it was really hard to come up with stuff"
32:29;32:30;"for the other guys,"
32:30;32:34;"to the point that I was looking at vintage Montreal shirts"
32:34;32:36;"on eBay for Seinfeld."
32:36;32:40;"Just like, and I ended up giving Nick the Montreal."
32:40;32:44;"But anyway, you are always, I've always considered,"
32:44;32:47;"you've always been a man of taste."
32:47;32:51;"We had a great interview recently in ""Blackbird Spy Plane,"""
32:51;32:52;"which everybody should check out,"
32:52;32:53;"where you're talking about your love"
32:53;32:58;"of Brazilian mid-century furniture, vintage magazines."
32:58;33:01;"You've always been a huge influence in my life."
33:01;33:03;"You're somebody who knows what's up."
33:03;33:04;"So it's funny, as we were talking about it,"
33:04;33:06;"and you're coming on the show, I was like,"
33:06;33:08;"you seem like somebody who probably"
33:08;33:10;"is really good at gift giving."
33:10;33:14;"I find it such an anxiety-inducing experience."
33:14;33:17;"I feel like I nail it one in every 12 times."
33:17;33:19;"But do you like giving gifts?"
33:19;33:22;"Are you a master? - I love it."
33:22;33:25;"I hope so, I definitely love it."
33:25;33:30;"And when Christmas time comes and I have to do,"
33:30;33:32;"hit off all my managers and my booking agent"
33:32;33:34;"and my booking agent's assistant,"
33:34;33:38;"and everybody in our orbit, I take great pleasure."
33:38;33:40;"I love it."
33:40;33:41;"- So what, okay, so for somebody like"
33:41;33:45;"the booking agent's assistant or something,"
33:45;33:48;"like, you know, who's somebody who probably"
33:48;33:50;"you appreciate them so much and all the hard work they do,"
33:50;33:52;"they're not like an old friend"
33:52;33:54;"that you're gonna get a vintage Steve Forbert shirt"
33:54;33:56;"'cause you know they're gonna find it."
33:56;33:58;"Yeah, so with somebody like that, how do you not just,"
33:58;34:00;"that's the exact type of person I'd be like,"
34:00;34:03;"oh God, what do I, and then like you go to a gift,"
34:03;34:05;"you look on a gift-giving website"
34:05;34:07;"and it's always gonna be a candle"
34:07;34:08;"or something kinda like--"
34:08;34:10;"- Well, I do two things."
34:10;34:15;"So I have people, like for instance, my book,"
34:15;34:19;"this is like, this is time crisis material,"
34:19;34:21;"this kind of stuff, I just wanna make sure I'm not like--"
34:21;34:23;"- I think this is great."
34:23;34:24;"- This is great."
34:24;34:25;"- Yeah."
34:25;34:27;"- Okay, so like for instance,"
34:27;34:31;"my touring agent, like sort of assistant,"
34:31;34:36;"I went with a theme of like, you must love hotels"
34:36;34:39;"and you must love the finer hotels."
34:39;34:43;"And so you must love the Soho House robe"
34:43;34:45;"because when you go to Soho House,"
34:45;34:47;"the robes are real plush and real nice."
34:47;34:50;"And you know, like Soho House, they have their own brand,"
34:50;34:52;"but like you can get on like Mr. Porter or whatever,"
34:52;34:56;"it's like, they have like their own like homeware"
34:56;34:59;"and like toiletries or whatnot."
34:59;35:01;"And so I got him a Soho House robe,"
35:01;35:04;"so that was kind of just a little bit of a tailored thing."
35:04;35:07;"And then if I'm gonna give, like for my main,"
35:07;35:10;"for Sam Hunt, for my main touring agent,"
35:10;35:13;"in his case, it is kind of candle adjacent stuff,"
35:13;35:16;"but it's a motif every year."
35:16;35:19;"So every year he knows he's gonna get"
35:19;35:22;"a sort of like a, you know, a scented something."
35:22;35:25;"It might be like, you know, scented steaks or whatever,"
35:25;35:27;"like oils for the house."
35:27;35:29;"- So the theme for him is scented."
35:29;35:35;"- Well, for him, the theme is like home sophistication."
35:35;35:38;"So, you know, like I might, next year I might get him"
35:38;35:41;"something that's not a candle, but he knows,"
35:41;35:42;"and he's always writing me like,"
35:42;35:45;"""Oh, you make my home so much classier every year."""
35:45;35:48;"You know, so that's an inside joke that I could repeat."
35:48;35:51;"So the thing is what I was gonna say for gift giving"
35:51;35:54;"is one good sort of, I don't wanna say a cop-out,"
35:54;35:58;"but it is a cop-out, is if you start developing,"
35:58;35:59;"if you do a pattern,"
35:59;36:02;"then you don't have to stress every year."
36:02;36:05;"And the person that gets your gift, yeah."
36:05;36:06;"Like for instance, my accountant,"
36:06;36:09;"my accountant loves to ski."
36:09;36:13;"Every year I get him one piece of ski gear, right?"
36:13;36:17;"So it could be a pair of gloves, a pair of goggles,"
36:17;36:19;"some like a cool little like ski jacket,"
36:19;36:21;"a backpack to go ski."
36:21;36:22;"So I don't have to think that much."
36:22;36:26;"I just gotta refresh the paradigm, you know?"
36:26;36:27;"And I think that's a good solution."
36:27;36:29;"- Hearing you talk, I'm also just thinking"
36:29;36:31;"about all the people that probably should be getting gifts"
36:31;36:36;"more regularly, but I get paralyzed by fear"
36:36;36:38;"and I don't have any of these."
36:38;36:40;"- I can't believe you give a gift to your accountant."
36:40;36:41;"That's amazing."
36:41;36:43;"- I think that should be the first person"
36:43;36:45;"you give a gift to, honestly."
36:45;36:46;"I think that-"
36:46;36:48;"- That would never occur to me."
36:48;36:49;"- No, you're-"
36:49;36:50;"- Jesus, Jesus Christ."
36:50;36:52;"This is, I gotta tell you."
36:52;36:52;"- Dave is a classic."
36:52;36:54;"- My mind is blown."
36:54;36:55;"- Why?"
36:55;36:57;"- As your accountant, you're, of all people,"
36:57;36:58;"your accountant's the first guy."
36:58;37:00;"- No, no, no, not the accountant part."
37:00;37:03;"You're right, I'm actually, I feel terrible"
37:03;37:05;"that that's not what I'm thinking."
37:05;37:07;"You know, that that person doesn't cross my mind."
37:07;37:09;"- Top five people."
37:09;37:11;"- But I totally get it, I follow the logic."
37:11;37:14;"I'm just sort of more, this entire,"
37:14;37:19;"this gift-giving ecosystem, it's just, it's good, dude."
37:19;37:20;"I don't know, I feel-"
37:20;37:22;"- No, it's tough because-"
37:22;37:23;"- I feel like I've missed a lot of opportunity."
37:23;37:27;"- And also, giving gifts is,"
37:27;37:30;"it does mean something to people,"
37:30;37:33;"and you don't wanna give somebody something thoughtless,"
37:33;37:34;"but-"
37:34;37:35;"- No, you can't, yeah."
37:35;37:38;"- That's why I was kinda like sometimes discovering,"
37:38;37:41;"oh, like these websites where you can send somebody"
37:41;37:44;"a Christmas-themed food, kinda."
37:44;37:46;"If you looked at my gift-giving, it's so sporadic."
37:46;37:49;"It's like one year, that guy got a Christmas present,"
37:49;37:52;"and next year, somebody got a birthday present, and-"
37:52;37:54;"- Yeah, but think about it, imagine all these people"
37:54;37:57;"who are so excited every year"
37:57;37:59;"because they're gonna get this thing from Dave,"
37:59;38:02;"and they know it now, and they're excited-"
38:02;38:03;"- My manager's like that."
38:03;38:06;"I love it, I find great pleasure in it."
38:06;38:09;"I had a tour manager for a long time,"
38:09;38:10;"like we had him for a few years,"
38:10;38:14;"and I would always give him sort of conspiracy books,"
38:14;38:17;"but not, you know, not, but not like,"
38:17;38:20;"not like, you know, not too far off."
38:20;38:23;"- Like ""Chaos"" by Tom O'Neill, do you know that one?"
38:23;38:24;"It's the one about the Manson murders."
38:24;38:25;"- I don't know that one."
38:25;38:26;"- Well, that's a good one for next year."
38:26;38:28;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, I got that one."
38:28;38:29;"I got that one, yeah."
38:29;38:31;"Actually, Ezra, you recommended that to me, and I read it."
38:31;38:34;"Exactly that, exactly that."
38:34;38:38;"Or some, or like some kind of Afghanistan-related stuff."
38:38;38:39;"You know, and it was cool."
38:39;38:43;"It was our little, it was our little interaction."
38:43;38:45;"And yeah, I would recommend that, Ezra."
38:45;38:50;"I would recommend finding sort of these through lines"
38:50;38:52;"with all the people you know,"
38:52;38:54;"based on one thing that you know is their interest,"
38:54;38:56;"and even if it doesn't even,"
38:56;38:58;"if it's not even their interest after a while,"
38:58;39:00;"they know that that's gonna be their lane with you,"
39:00;39:02;"so they kind of expect the inside joke."
39:02;39:04;"How are you gonna renew it this year?"
39:04;39:06;"And every year is a little variation,"
39:06;39:07;"and that's enough to keep them happy."

39:51;39:53;"it's more than, you know, they're friends,"
39:53;39:56;"it's not always just like in some industries,"
39:56;39:57;"all right, that's a guy I work with,"
39:57;40:01;"there's a closeness, but let's go one step beyond."
40:01;40:05;"Family, your girl, these kind of people."
40:05;40:10;"How about for your brother, world famous DJ, A-Trak,"
40:10;40:15;"like, what do you get in him for the holidays?"
40:15;40:16;"- That changes every year."
40:16;40:19;"- 'Cause you know him so well that you,"
40:19;40:21;"but what's your way of thinking about that?"
40:21;40:25;"- I assess what his needs are each year."
40:25;40:29;"Like last year I was like, bro, your bedsheets are crap."
40:29;40:31;"You have really whack bedsheets."
40:31;40:33;"So I got him like the best, best sheets I knew,"
40:33;40:36;"like the best, best, best bedsheets I could think of."
40:36;40:38;"And then I was like, if you like him in New York,"
40:38;40:40;"you should get him for yourself in LA."
40:40;40:42;"You know, that was like my whole thing with him."
40:42;40:44;"- What's the thread count on those?"
40:44;40:45;"- No, it's not, it's not."
40:45;40:46;"- Oh, it's not a thread count."
40:46;40:47;"- No, no, it's not."
40:47;40:50;"That doesn't apply to linen."
40:50;40:52;"It's post thread."
40:52;40:53;"- Oh, I thought you could do, oh."
40:53;40:56;"- Oh, it's a linen, it's a linen material."
40:56;40:59;"Oh yeah, I like a linen bedspread."
40:59;41:00;"It's very nice."
41:00;41:03;"- Okay, see, now I'm making a note."
41:03;41:06;"I mean, you know, maybe I'll start you off"
41:06;41:08;"with just like one of the, I mean, those are,"
41:08;41:10;"yeah, you just like pay attention."
41:10;41:12;"- Not a joke, not a joke though."
41:12;41:14;"Do you take any notes about that?"
41:14;41:16;"I mean, it sounds like you're buying gifts"
41:16;41:17;"for so many people."
41:17;41:18;"- Oh yeah, you keep track of it all."
41:18;41:20;"- Do you note this, yeah."
41:20;41:24;"- So at the end of the year, I do have a note."
41:24;41:27;"Yeah, in December, I start making a note"
41:27;41:30;"of everybody I wanna get a gift for."
41:30;41:32;"My whole thing with gifts is that like,"
41:32;41:35;"I don't expect a gift back."
41:35;41:38;"What I always think and sometimes say"
41:38;41:40;"is pay me back with loyalty."
41:40;41:45;"And I think when you give gifts regularly"
41:45;41:47;"to people around you that work with you,"
41:47;41:51;"I think you gain loyalty points."
41:51;41:52;"- It's a mafia (beep)"
41:52;41:53;"- That's heavy duty."
41:53;41:55;"- I don't need a robe, I don't need a candle,"
41:55;41:57;"but one day I may ask you to do something."
41:57;41:58;"And when that day comes."
41:58;42:03;"- No, no, it's more like one day I might,"
42:03;42:07;"one day, I don't know, Ezra,"
42:07;42:08;"one day some other corny ass band"
42:08;42:10;"might wanna be on your roster"
42:10;42:12;"and you might have to turn them down."
42:12;42:13;"I don't know."
42:13;42:14;"- Right, no, who knows?"
42:14;42:15;"- I don't know."
42:15;42:18;"- No, no, you're showing loyalty in a basic sense"
42:18;42:21;"in that you're like,"
42:21;42:25;"when you get somebody a regular gift,"
42:25;42:26;"it shows at the end of the year"
42:26;42:28;"when I'm taking stock of my life,"
42:28;42:30;"you're somebody I think about."
42:30;42:31;"- Yeah."
42:31;42:31;"- And that's nice."
42:31;42:34;"- You know what, it's not even about them"
42:34;42:37;"turning down a corny band 'cause that's actually,"
42:37;42:42;"I think we're past that point in our lives"
42:42;42:43;"and in our careers."
42:43;42:47;"I think it's more like they know that working for us is hard."
42:47;42:49;"It's sometimes a pain in the ass."
42:49;42:51;"We're a very demanding band."
42:51;42:56;"We're very, very rigorous in all aspects of our work."
42:56;42:59;"And I know that P and I can be a lot."
42:59;43:01;"And this is my way of saying, thank you."
43:01;43:03;"Let's keep it going."
43:03;43:05;"And I think for a lot of people in our team,"
43:05;43:06;"they're like, damn, man,"
43:06;43:09;"Dave literally writes us cards, gives us gifts."
43:09;43:11;"He's thoughtful."
43:11;43:12;"Yeah, it's a lot to deal with him and P,"
43:12;43:14;"but this dude's a mensch."
43:14;43:17;"- Yeah, 'cause I guess when you take the balance"
43:17;43:19;"of the year, maybe you call people more"
43:19;43:20;"than some of their other clients"
43:20;43:23;"'cause you're like, you got stuff on your mind"
43:23;43:25;"and whatever, and you wanna say, yeah, it's nice to say,"
43:25;43:26;"I recognize that."
43:26;43:28;"I might call you more than some people."
43:28;43:31;"I might be stressing about something you think is small,"
43:31;43:33;"but I recognize that."
43:33;43:36;"And I appreciate that you've shown loyalty to me"
43:36;43:37;"throughout all that."
43:37;43:37;"- Yep."

44:39;44:40;"Can you ever give somebody a tree"
44:40;44:42;"that bears fruit or vegetables?"
44:42;44:44;"'Cause that's the gift that keeps on giving."
44:44;44:48;"- It is, I thought, but that's actually out of my wheelhouse."
44:48;44:53;"But not because I don't appreciate the sort of symbolism"
44:53;44:57;"or the pun, it's because I'm really not like sort"
44:57;44:59;"of a horty horticulturist."
44:59;45:01;"Like I just don't have that knowledge,"
45:01;45:04;"but actually that'd be dope."
45:04;45:07;"Like, you know, if someone you know, like, I don't know,"
45:07;45:11;"like if someone you know is like really nice in the kitchen"

45:13;45:15;"I don't know if it's basil or something like that."
45:15;45:17;"And they might, that might be really cool."
45:17;45:19;"- Every time they taste it, they think of you."
45:19;45:22;"- Yeah."
45:22;45:23;"- You know, Dave, actually it's funny."
45:23;45:24;"It came up recently."
45:24;45:27;"There's a gift that you gave in my household"
45:27;45:29;"that actually we talk about quite a bit."
45:29;45:34;"And that's when our son was born, you gave him cologne."
45:34;45:35;"- Yep."
45:35;45:36;"- Wow."
45:36;45:37;"- Sick."
45:37;45:39;"(laughing)"
45:39;45:39;"- Wait, hold on."
45:39;45:41;"What kind of cologne do you give a baby?"
45:41;45:43;"- It was baby cologne."
45:43;45:47;"It was from Jacadi, which makes clothes"
45:47;45:49;"for babies and children and stuff."
45:49;45:54;"And we, you were the only person who gave him cologne,"
45:54;45:56;"but then you also, it was, we always think of you"
45:56;45:58;"because you, and you know, every once in a blue moon,"
45:58;46:00;"he'll like spray it in his room and smell it"
46:00;46:01;"'cause he still has it."
46:01;46:03;"'Cause yeah, of course he wasn't like wearing it every day"
46:03;46:05;"as a baby, so there's a bunch left,"
46:05;46:08;"but it was, we always remember that"
46:08;46:10;"because that way you also taught us that that's,"
46:10;46:16;"that's pretty normal in French culture."
46:16;46:17;"- Mediterranean."
46:17;46:18;"There's two things."
46:18;46:19;"And I remember, I actually wanted to give him"
46:19;46:23;"something else, but you guys pushed back a little bit."
46:23;46:24;"- Wait, what was that?"
46:24;46:28;"- I wanted to give him a little name bracelet."
46:28;46:29;"And--"
46:29;46:29;"- Oh, you know what?"
46:29;46:30;"That's funny."
46:30;46:31;"That's how this all came up because actually,"
46:31;46:35;"speaking of gifts giving, I, for Rashida's birthday,"
46:35;46:38;"which was last week, I was like,"
46:38;46:40;"I'm gonna get her some jewelry."
46:40;46:43;"And I went to a cool, funky place and I was looking at stuff"
46:43;46:46;"and I knew she liked a certain kind of color or something."
46:46;46:48;"And this woman said, oh, here's an idea."
46:48;46:51;"These are these Victorian baby rings"
46:51;46:53;"that you could put together for a necklace."
46:53;46:54;"And we kind of made like a cool necklace."
46:54;46:58;"But then of course we start talking about baby jewelry"
46:58;47:00;"and that's what led to this whole conversation."
47:00;47:03;"'Cause obviously babies tend not to wear rings"
47:03;47:05;"as much these days."
47:05;47:07;"But it used to be a real thing in many different cultures,"
47:07;47:09;"putting jewelry on babies."
47:09;47:11;"But of course in modern times,"
47:11;47:13;"most people think of it as a choking hazard."
47:13;47:16;"So there's probably some part of it of even baby"
47:16;47:20;"having a little bracelet probably just like freaked us out."
47:20;47:21;"'Cause it's just like--"
47:21;47:22;"- You guys weren't into it."
47:22;47:24;"Yeah, you guys were not into it."
47:24;47:25;"- No, it's thoughtful."
47:25;47:26;"I think it probably just freaked us out."
47:26;47:29;"- Yeah, but if you're like for Moroccans or French people"
47:29;47:32;"or Italian people, Lebanese, P, like P and I,"
47:32;47:34;"every baby's got a little name bracelet."
47:34;47:35;"- Always, always."
47:35;47:37;"And there's a French word for it."
47:37;47:38;"It's called a gourmet."
47:38;47:42;"And it's something that you have like,"
47:42;47:44;"I don't know, the minute you're like two or three years old,"
47:44;47:46;"there's like a tiny, it's a very fine bracelet"
47:46;47:48;"with like a little name plate"
47:48;47:50;"and your name is written in cursive."
47:50;47:55;"And yeah, like I had one, like P had one,"
47:55;47:57;"my brother had one, everyone."
47:57;47:59;"And that's usually a nice gift."
47:59;48:00;"You guys did not like that."
48:00;48:04;"- So I guess for you, between the baby bracelet"
48:04;48:09;"and the cologne, you never have to think too hard"
48:09;48:12;"about what to get when there's a new baby on the scene."
48:12;48:15;"- It's weird, like I do ask my mom usually."
48:15;48:18;"Well, it depends, like, yeah, clothing is great."
48:18;48:22;"I have a goddaughter who turned three"
48:22;48:25;"and usually I always give her clothing,"
48:25;48:27;"but this time for the first time on her birthday,"
48:27;48:28;"I gave her a Casio."
48:28;48:30;"And I thought that was like really dope."
48:30;48:33;"And luckily I went to B&H and I found-"
48:33;48:34;"- A Casio what?"
48:34;48:35;"- No, no, a Casio keyboard."
48:35;48:37;"Like we've all like a- - Oh, oh, oh."
48:37;48:40;"- Yeah, a Casio, every kid's gotta have a Casio."
48:40;48:43;"I'll just think of like every kid has to have a Casio,"
48:43;48:46;"but also, you know, when we were babies,"
48:46;48:49;"like my mom used to always spray baby cologne on us."
48:49;48:50;"That's like a thing."
48:50;48:51;"- Yeah."
48:51;48:52;"- And watch with Isaiah,"
48:52;48:54;"bet you it's gonna bring him pleasure."
48:54;48:57;"Like it's like a little sensory thing."
48:57;48:58;"I'm gonna get him other ones."
48:58;49:00;"- When he remembers that, like, oh yeah,"
49:00;49:03;"it's in his dresser and he like takes it out"
49:03;49:04;"and he likes to spray it."
49:04;49:08;"- And it's very, I mean, I think that for kids,"
49:08;49:10;"and again, like I just think for kids,"
49:10;49:14;"like in Mediterranean cultures or like European cultures,"
49:14;49:17;"there's a lot of like little thoughtful, sweet nothings"
49:17;49:22;"or little things that are good baby gifts, you know?"
49:22;49:26;"- I like seeing a baby with the ears pierced sometimes,"
49:26;49:30;"adds a little sparkle, adds a little extra shine."
49:30;49:31;"- Oh yeah, there's some places"
49:31;49:34;"where the baby gets their ears pierced ASAP."
49:34;49:36;"- Very early, yeah, very early."
49:36;49:39;"That's, I mean, South Asian cultures, definitely."
49:39;49:41;"- What about for a significant other?"
49:41;49:45;"Like I imagine that also changes year to year."
49:45;49:47;"- You know, yeah."
49:47;49:49;"- Do you have any advice?"
49:49;49:51;"'Cause that's a big one for a lot of people out there."
49:51;49:53;"What do I get for my significant other?"
49:53;49:55;"- Yeah, for that one,"
49:55;49:59;"you have to start planting the seeds a few months in advance."
49:59;50:01;"I think that's the key."
50:01;50:04;"'Cause you know, they say like it's, you know, whatever,"
50:04;50:06;"when they say like it's the thought that counts,"
50:06;50:08;"but I don't think it's the thought,"
50:08;50:11;"it's the thought process that counts."
50:11;50:16;"So I think that like the more depth there is"
50:16;50:22;"in sort of the genealogy of the gift, if I can say,"
50:22;50:26;"the happier and the more meaningful it's gonna feel."
50:26;50:29;"- Right, so you're saying even if it's not"
50:29;50:30;"like a slam dunk, like,"
50:30;50:33;"and that became my favorite sweater of all time"
50:33;50:34;"that I wear every day,"
50:34;50:38;"the fact that the story behind it was coherent."
50:38;50:42;"- A need and a desire expressed over a long period of time"
50:42;50:47;"and also sometimes like an inside joke or a motif,"
50:47;50:50;"you know, so that there's either there's a buildup"
50:50;50:53;"or when the gift is given, the person's like,"
50:53;50:55;"oh my God, of course you were gonna give me,"
50:55;50:58;"this is awesome, you know, that thing."
50:58;51:03;"'Cause like one year I gave my fiance like a practical gift"
51:03;51:08;"and it's probably the gift, I gave her a Rimowa suitcase,"
51:08;51:11;"brand spanking new, silver, big box,"
51:11;51:14;"it was there in the house, what's in the box?"
51:14;51:16;"And she uses it all the time."
51:16;51:19;"In fact, she had a terrible suitcase before"
51:19;51:23;"and she probably thinks this is the most useful, best gift."
51:23;51:25;"I've never given her anything she's used more,"
51:25;51:28;"but she was kind of nonplussed when I gave it to her"
51:28;51:30;"because it came out of the blue,"
51:30;51:32;"she had never said, oh, I need a new suit,"
51:32;51:36;"it was just like, oh, well like, yeah, thanks dad."
51:36;51:40;"You know, like it had this thing, it didn't hit."
51:40;51:43;"- I love, this is very classic time crisis"
51:43;51:44;"that we're just always kind of like out of step"
51:44;51:49;"with the time that we're doing like a really thoughtful"
51:49;51:54;"gift giving guide in like late winter."
51:54;51:56;"- Just literally, no, no, I've already been,"
51:56;51:58;"there's literally, there isn't a Valentine,"
51:58;52:03;"there's nothing, there's no moment to give a gift."
52:03;52:05;"- I mean, there's probably some sales,"
52:05;52:07;"there's probably some really good sales going on."
52:07;52:10;"- I mean, well, who knows, maybe we inspired somebody"
52:10;52:11;"to start making their list now."
52:11;52:13;"I mean, if I think about myself,"
52:13;52:15;"I should probably make a list now"
52:15;52:18;"for like end of the year presents."
52:18;52:21;"And I also feel like for me, maybe this isn't good,"
52:21;52:25;"but for me, I've also realized if I ever see something"
52:25;52:27;"that seems like novel, where I'm like,"
52:27;52:30;"oh, that's kind of a fun thing."
52:30;52:34;"As if it's not expensive, I should probably just buy it"
52:34;52:38;"and put it in a drawer because the next thing you know,"
52:38;52:41;"like, I don't know, like I found this website"
52:41;52:45;"that had a lot of kind of like gag gifts,"
52:45;52:48;"like world's smallest vacuum cleaner,"
52:48;52:52;"or a lollipop with a scorpion in it."
52:52;52:54;"- I don't know, Ezra."
52:54;52:57;"That's usually, that's the ancillary gift."
52:57;53:02;"Like for instance, my parents, for Christmas, they'll ask,"
53:02;53:04;"I mean, yeah, we give gifts for Christmas,"
53:04;53:06;"even though we're Jewish and stuff."
53:06;53:07;"- Yeah."
53:07;53:09;"- They'll be like the one gift you need,"
53:09;53:11;"like a new knife set."
53:11;53:12;"- Yeah."
53:12;53:13;"- Then there's the useless doodads,"
53:13;53:18;"which run the gamut from like maple syrup candy"
53:18;53:21;"to like an inside joke with the vacuum cleaner"
53:21;53:24;"to like, you know, some funny stuff,"
53:24;53:25;"socks with a funny pattern"
53:25;53:26;"that you know you're never gonna use."
53:26;53:31;"Like I wouldn't make the novelty gift the primary focus,"
53:31;53:33;"but like, I think that the vintage T-shirt thing"
53:33;53:35;"really suits everyone."
53:35;53:37;"- So maybe you just gotta buy that vintage T-shirt."
53:37;53:39;"- I felt very seen."
53:39;53:40;"- Yeah, you felt seen."
53:40;53:42;"So Jake, you're saying you felt super seen."
53:42;53:44;"Yeah, I mean, from the little I know of you,"
53:44;53:46;"this feels very on brand."
53:46;53:47;"- No, it was an incredible gift."
53:47;53:49;"I don't see that Steve Forbert shirt"
53:49;53:52;"probably like a top 10 gift I've received in my life."
53:52;53:53;"- Wow."
53:53;53:55;"- But that's exactly, 'cause you felt seen,"
53:55;53:59;"'cause Ezra dialed in on like the sort of niche interest."
53:59;54:01;"And now Ezra, what you gotta do"
54:01;54:03;"is not other Steve Forbert shirt,"
54:03;54:06;"is you're gonna have to up the ante."
54:06;54:10;"Well, or it's always some kind of singer songwriter"
54:10;54:13;"of that era, but it could be another piece of memorabilia,"
54:13;54:14;"it could be a mug,"
54:14;54:16;"and like you're gonna spend the whole year-"
54:16;54:17;"- It's a Fogelberg hoodie."
54:17;54:20;"♪ I get strong from a love band ♪"
54:20;54:22;"♪ I wish she'd care to see ♪"
54:22;54:25;"♪ But she only cares when she's got the time ♪"
54:25;54:28;"♪ And I think so much about her love band ♪"
54:28;54:29;"♪ I wish she'd let me be ♪"
54:29;54:33;"♪ But our destinies got us intertwined ♪"
54:33;54:36;"♪ And is it really my fault ♪"
54:36;54:40;"♪ I get a shiver when I see her with those other guys ♪"
54:40;54:44;"♪ Wearing the jacket I bought ♪"
54:44;54:48;"I can't help but lose my temper And I don't know why"
54:48;54:51;"I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it"
54:51;54:55;"When the fellas talk to my girl I ain't with it"
54:55;54:59;"I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it"
54:59;55:03;"When the fellas talk to my girl I ain't with it"
55:03;55:18;"I ain't with it"
55:18;55:27;"Actually, I don't want to put Ezra on the spot, but I have witnessed Ezra give an equally thoughtful gift, the Zodiac watch to Jake a few years ago."
55:27;55:28;"Oh yeah, that's true."
55:28;55:29;"One of his favorite films."
55:29;55:30;"You know what's funny about that one?"
55:30;55:32;"Yeah, that's amazing."
55:32;55:33;"I know, I know, but it's..."
55:33;55:35;"I really need to step my game up."
55:35;55:36;"Jesus."
55:36;55:37;"No, no, but that was..."
55:37;55:39;"Well, you got, Jake, you got to start by lacing your accountant."
55:39;55:42;"I think that's, that should be top priority."
55:42;55:44;"Ezra's fine for a minute."
55:44;55:52;"Yeah, you and Ezra's got, you got some good stuff going on. There's a lot of love in the bank. I think the accountant, you need to hit him up."
55:52;56:03;"And also, there's definitely more onus on me. The show, maybe we should change it, but the show is called Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig. You know, I got a do right."
56:03;56:04;"Flagship."
56:04;56:07;"By my guys, so yeah, I don't expect..."
56:07;56:14;"You want them to be loyal. You don't want them to pop up on another, you know, like, it's like, this is the crew."
56:14;56:17;"They start, they go on Elton John's radio show."
56:17;56:18;"Yeah."
56:18;56:27;"Yeah, but you know, it's funny. I got Jake a vintage Zodiac watch, but it was a bit, it wasn't quite, at the end of the day, Jake is a man who loves wearing t-shirts."
56:27;56:35;"He's not a watch guy, but Jake's favorite movie of all time, maybe, is the film Zodiac about the Zodiac killer."
56:35;56:37;"Wow. Top five, sure."
56:37;56:38;"That's cool."
56:38;56:45;"And you know, that's the whole thing in the movie is that the guy looks and he realizes that they're interviewing a potential suspect and he's wearing a Zodiac watch."
56:45;56:51;"And they realize like, wait a second, the Zodiac killer's logo probably came from the Zodiac watch."
56:51;56:59;"So, you know, it was definitely tied into one of Jake's interests. But again, Jake might wear a t-shirt every day. How often is he going to want to throw on a vintage watch?"
56:59;57:08;"This just came up last week with Hannah because we're going to a fancy wedding in Minnesota this summer and I'm going to be wearing a suit."
57:08;57:09;"Okay."
57:09;57:14;"And I said, I said, ""Oh, this is a great opportunity. I'm going to bust out the Zodiac watch."""
57:14;57:18;"I mean, that's great, Jake. That's an amazing thing."
57:18;57:26;"And wear it with a suit. So it's, you know, it's not just sitting at the bottom of the drawer forgotten about. It's just, you know, maybe once a year there's an
opportunity for me."
57:26;57:28;"And that'll be a great conversation piece."
57:28;57:31;"I was just going to say the conversation is going to be out of control."
57:31;57:37;"Talk to a guy at the table, like, ""What kind of watch is that?"" We'll say, ""All right, well, you know, the Zodiac killer? I'm a huge fan of his."""
57:37;57:38;"Yep."
57:38;57:40;"And all my friends know."
57:40;57:44;"That's exactly what it is. It's amazing. That's really good."
57:44;57:56;"Okay. Now that this actually is turning into gift-giving guide with Dave Maklovich, what about, I know I'm going to hear some people listening, hearing about, you
know, some of the finer things."
57:56;58:00;"They're going to say, ""Well, listen, man, I don't got a lot of money to spend on big brands."""
58:00;58:01;"Of course."
58:01;58:04;"What is your guide for the broke gift-giver?"
58:04;58:18;"Two things. I think if you, if there's, okay, so if it's a significant other, obviously, I know you guys are going to laugh a little bit, but like a card, like a thoughtful
card, a thoughtful message, I think that's huge. Goes a very long way."
58:18;58:21;"Are you buying like a Hallmark card at CVS?"
58:21;58:25;"No, it doesn't matter. No, it doesn't. I mean, if I might get a fun card."
58:25;58:26;"I like the card actually."
58:26;58:31;"Yeah, they're funny. Some of them are funny. The card just has to be vibey and funny. That's all."
58:31;58:32;"Yeah."
58:32;58:47;"But then if you're on a budget, I think you go the route of the inside joke. And I think, because again, like you said, like it's about making the person feel seen. You can
do that with not a lot."
58:47;59:01;"But if you know that this person loves Nutella, you get them one of those giant Nutella jars. That's probably what, $25? And like the person will be like, ""Oh my God, you
get me. This is too funny."""
59:01;59:03;"Right. Yeah, I love that."
59:03;59:09;"That's going to run you anywhere from $38 to $90, depending on the size of the jar."
59:09;59:11;"Are you pricing that out right now?"
59:11;59:13;"I'm doing a bit of a number crunch here."
59:13;59:14;"Yeah, number crunch."
59:14;59:17;"And you're going to tell me the jumbo Nutella is $90?"
59:17;59:20;"I mean, I'm looking at one right now that's $200."
59:20;59:22;"Oh, that's some psychotically large ones."
59:22;59:28;"That's crazy. But just like a nice, like even if it's a Costco size, like it's cool, you know?"
59:28;59:36;"And I guess even if you really were on a crazy budget, handmade card with a thoughtful note and then just two Nutellas wrapped up."
59:36;59:40;"Yeah, that's a great gift actually, if the person loves Nutella."
59:40;59:46;"Was it Netflix that sent us, after we made Neo Yokio, I felt like Netflix sent you the giant Toblerone."
59:46;59:47;"Yeah, that was thoughtful."
59:47;59:51;"That was like a very thoughtful, especially from the network, I felt like so thoughtful."
59:51;59:57;"They understood the thing. But again, I think what we're getting at with Dave here, and again, not revelatory,"
59:57;01:00:06;"but the idea that it is truly the gift giver's intention is to like see something, make you feel seen."
01:00:06;01:00:10;"It really is not, that is not a monetary thing at all."
01:00:10;01:00:16;"No, no, not at all. Not at all. I mean, Ezra, even on your birthday, when I was like, okay, a Zabars basket."
01:00:16;01:00:18;"I'm like, okay, he hasn't been to New York in a while."
01:00:18;01:00:23;"Zabars is a big part of the universe. You've got this like super cool house."
01:00:23;01:00:27;"There's always, there's people coming by. There's all kinds of knickknacks in there that you can eat."
01:00:27;01:00:29;"I don't know when's the last time you had lox."
01:00:29;01:00:34;"Like, you know, it's just like, there's that little commonality, that little inside joke."
01:00:34;01:00:37;"I don't know if the gift landed, but to me it made sense."
01:00:37;01:00:38;"No, I love that."
01:00:38;01:00:41;"And it's fun. It's fun."
01:00:41;01:00:49;"I'm trying to think of, I have some memory once of giving you a Leonard Cohen record for your birthday."
01:00:49;01:00:53;"It was a Leonard Cohen live record. And it made me think of you."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"But yeah, but that's cool."
01:00:55;01:00:58;"It wasn't a bullseye, but it's like, there's obviously the Montreal connection."
01:00:58;01:01:02;"It's this record where he looks really cool. He's got kind of a shaved head."
01:01:02;01:01:05;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I have it. Yeah, it's over there. Yeah, I have it."
01:01:05;01:01:11;"Now to flip it around, though, what's one of the best gifts you've gotten in recent memory that was like, oh, wow."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"That's because what do you get the guy who has that?"
01:01:13;01:01:17;"I'm sure people are intimidated by you because you're known to have such good taste."
01:01:17;01:01:20;"You're great at giving gifts. You're thoughtful."
01:01:20;01:01:23;"And you put so much thought into the things that you buy."
01:01:23;01:01:28;"You know, every place you've ever lived that I've been to is very neatly arranged."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"You have things the way you like it."
01:01:30;01:01:33;"You're not a hoarder with clothes."
01:01:33;01:01:39;"You put so much thought into it. So it'd be a little daunting to buy you a shirt or something."
01:01:39;01:01:42;"Yeah. So how does that work when it's turned around?"
01:01:42;01:01:47;"Well, OK, but like, let's say I'll give you two examples."
01:01:47;01:01:53;"Not to say that, like just first to start on like the meaningful thing, you and me, like the friend thing."
01:01:53;01:01:56;"I'm not trying to put you on the spot or give you inspo for the next gift."
01:01:56;01:02:02;"But like, do you remember when we were both at the Fleetwood Mac concert and there was the Lindsey Buckingham?"
01:02:02;01:02:08;"She started shredding on one of like a solo, not a solo song, but like one of his."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"I mean, I remember the song. It was I'm so afraid."
01:02:10;01:02:17;"And then everybody that's been, and everybody that had been standing up for the last few songs sat down."
01:02:17;01:02:24;"And then you looked back and I was the only guy standing up with my eyes closed, like really feeling it."
01:02:24;01:02:29;"You kind of commented on that. Then it's like, OK, I remember you seeing that."
01:02:29;01:02:34;"Case in point. So that like, let's say the following birthday you get me like the Lindsey Buckingham book."
01:02:34;01:02:38;"I'd be like, that's so funny. Like, that's right. You know what I mean?"
01:02:38;01:02:42;"Like it's like a little through line in our in our inside jokes."
01:02:42;01:02:48;"But like for me, usually the people that are close to me, they do definitely ask, like, what do you want?"
01:02:48;01:02:52;"Like, what's the deal? Would just give me something."
01:02:52;01:02:59;"And like my brother, I remember not this year, but last year I was like, dude, I need a dustbuster."
01:02:59;01:03:03;"But like every dustbuster I've ever had is crap."
01:03:03;01:03:07;"They don't work after a year. Somehow they lose power."
01:03:07;01:03:10;"Even when you plug them, they never stay, never work anymore."
01:03:10;01:03:13;"Like they're just like these things are not built to last."
01:03:13;01:03:16;"And so my brother was like, leave it with me."
01:03:16;01:03:22;"And like he went on the air and like looked up the best dustbusters and blah, blah, blah."
01:03:22;01:03:32;"And like went to Queens, because that's like where they sold the one and like got me this like incredible dustbuster that had the best reviews."
01:03:32;01:03:44;"And that was cool because in that thought, in that in that scenario, it was like, OK, you really went in and try to match my standards, you know, and that touched me."
01:03:44;01:03:50;"That touched me. He didn't just go to Home Depot or Bed Bath and just got me like a Dyson."
01:03:50;01:03:55;"Like I don't want a Dyson. In fact, my Dyson broke. Dyson is a scam."
01:03:55;01:03:58;"He went and read reviews and got me the best one."
01:03:58;01:04:00;"What is the best one? Black and Decker?"
01:04:00;01:04:03;"No, no, it's off brand. Let me go find it."
01:04:03;01:04:09;"And now every time you use your dustbuster, which I mean, you're a bit of a neat freak is probably all the time."
01:04:09;01:04:14;"Yeah, exactly. You should think of once every other day. Yeah, exactly."
01:04:14;01:04:21;"Let's see. Oh, it's called the shark. It's called the shark."
01:04:21;01:04:26;"It's the shark. And it's and it's straight up looks like a hammerhead shark."
01:04:26;01:04:30;"Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I never understood that. But yeah, that's it."
01:04:30;01:04:32;"That's the shark. Found it in Queens."
01:04:32;01:04:37;"I'm probably taking away all the wrong lessons from this conversation, but it just flashed through my mind."
01:04:37;01:04:48;"Next year, everybody gets a shark. Accountant. Wife. Cousins. Mailman, you're getting a shark."
01:04:49;01:04:57;"Oh, so many ways to get the team."
01:04:57;01:05:00;"I never change. I never will."
01:05:00;01:05:05;"I'm so afraid. Well, I'll see you."
01:05:05;01:05:09;"Days with the rain and the sun."
01:05:09;01:05:21;"I'm. So."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"Slipping."
01:05:25;01:05:28;"So."
01:05:28;01:05:57;"So."
01:05:57;01:06:05;"I was in London last week doing some press and, you know, playing the label of new album coming out, all that stuff."
01:06:05;01:06:12;"And, you know, I'm not. I do feel like when you travel away from your family, you should bring back a little something."
01:06:12;01:06:22;"Yeah. Nothing massive. But I was in a cute little store and they sold this set of Nairns, which makes really good biscuits."
01:06:22;01:06:30;"And like and but these were Nairns cheese biscuits and it came with Marmite and it said love it or hate it."
01:06:30;01:06:38;"You got to try it. And there was some part of me. I saw this and I was like, and I do kind of like Marmite and I do like funky, funky flavors."
01:06:38;01:06:42;"And then I got home with it. Luckily, I got a couple other things."
01:06:42;01:06:49;"I got like a nice honey and I got, you know, this like a tiny little magic trick for my son."
01:06:49;01:06:53;"But with the Nairns biscuits, I just saw it. I was like, oh, that seems fun."
01:06:53;01:06:57;"But then when I brought it home, I realized like nobody really wants to eat this in my house."
01:06:57;01:07:03;"Doesn't matter. Just have it over tea for the next day. And it's funny. The inside joke is there."
01:07:03;01:07:12;"Don't you guys remember like our parents, like when we were kids, our parents, every time they went anywhere, they brought something."
01:07:12;01:07:16;"Like it's like it was systematic and the guests would bring wine."
01:07:16;01:07:20;"It was like, I feel like with our generation, I mean, I'm assuming we're all the same generation."
01:07:20;01:07:25;"You think that's a generational thing or like a French Moroccan kind of thing?"
01:07:25;01:07:28;"No, I know. Really, Jake? What are you?"
01:07:28;01:07:35;"My dad goes on a business trip to Dallas. He's not coming back with a token, a little cowboy hat."
01:07:35;01:07:36;"Really?"
01:07:36;01:07:44;"No, but Jake, if your parents were like taking you guys over to somebody else's house, they would always bring what a bottle of wine or a sweetie?"
01:07:44;01:07:46;"Maybe. I don't know. Wait, hold on. We have to go."
01:07:46;01:07:49;"When you're 10 years old, you don't notice whether your parents are grabbing a bottle of wine."
01:07:49;01:07:54;"No, I won't even go with your parents. When you go to a guest house, do you bring something?"
01:07:54;01:08:02;"Like if you're going, not even a guest, if you're going over to Ezra's or my house or someone's house you're at pretty frequently, do you bring something?"
01:08:02;01:08:03;"Do you and Hannah bring something?"
01:08:03;01:08:09;"If it's a dinner? Yeah. We'll either ask or just bring a bottle."
01:08:09;01:08:14;"A bottle of red."
01:08:14;01:08:19;"But if I'm just popping over to your house for a quick swim or something, then yeah."
01:08:19;01:08:28;"A bunch of dudes. Dude on dude hang. No. And maybe this is a thing where my wife is from the South."
01:08:28;01:08:39;"They come with a certain, and I think like maybe, you know, Dave and Simon from Montreal, she would never, ever show up to someone's house without some kind of gift."
01:08:39;01:08:40;"It's unthinkable."
01:08:40;01:08:44;"So I don't know if it's generational or if it's geographical, but it's something."
01:08:44;01:08:54;"But our parents, yeah, but it's like, it's big. I don't know. I think it's like our parents, they would do it like every single time there was a dinner. It wasn't just wine."
01:08:54;01:09:06;"No, and it's a good thing. And it's also one thing that I've learned over my life is I just think my parents, I just don't remember, like we weren't doing like a ton of like
family socializing."
01:09:06;01:09:14;"But it's been, as I've learned in life too, it's also, I think there's probably a part of me that's like, well, what is it like a bougie thing?"
01:09:14;01:09:18;"And then you realize, no, because you can bring something that costs almost nothing."
01:09:18;01:09:24;"And it really, that's true. Like you said, you know, the thought that counts or the thought process that counts."
01:09:24;01:09:30;"And also, maybe it's also when I think back to my weird little cheese biscuit and Marmite set."
01:09:30;01:09:34;"It's good to have stuff like that around the house because it's also like kind of fun."
01:09:34;01:09:38;"You know what? I'm a big fan of Miracle Berries."
01:09:38;01:09:43;"You know, these little things that you eat and then lemons taste sweet."
01:09:43;01:09:49;"And it's also because it's a, they're actually cool, but it's like a bit of a gag too."
01:09:49;01:09:51;"So like I realized, like, you know what? I like sharing these with people."
01:09:51;01:09:57;"So it's nice to have a bunch around the house and it's nice to have some extra packets in case you're going to somebody's house."
01:09:57;01:10:03;"It's almost like the equivalent of like bringing a game over just to say like, all right, guys, now we're all going to eat Marmite."
01:10:03;01:10:05;"Oh, I don't know if I like Marmite. Oh, that's that weird English."
01:10:05;01:10:09;"You know, it's like, it's almost like you're eventizing it."
01:10:09;01:10:14;"Of course. I mean, even when you gave me the Rasheeda cereal, remember that?"
01:10:14;01:10:16;"Oh, the like the healthy cereal?"
01:10:16;01:10:19;"Yeah. Yeah. I took that home. I was so happy."
01:10:19;01:10:21;"Magic spoon."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"Yeah."
01:10:22;01:10:26;"Yeah. There's something nice about being like, you're just hanging out with some friends like, all right, we all got to try this."
01:10:26;01:10:27;"Let's see if we like it."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
01:10:28;01:10:29;"It's kind of like a fun thing."
01:10:29;01:10:34;"And I guess if you're into wine, even that could be like a thing. Let's see how this wine is."
01:10:34;01:10:36;"Of course. That's what they do."
01:10:36;01:10:37;"Right."
01:10:37;01:10:40;"Dave, what's your what's your take on a gift certificate?"
01:10:40;01:10:43;"In my mind, put a load up enough cash on that thing."
01:10:43;01:10:45;"It's the gift that keeps on giving."
01:10:45;01:10:48;"That's your sign."
01:10:48;01:10:52;"I can tell that you've got this is like this is important for you."
01:10:52;01:10:55;"Right. You want something that's look, it's compact."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"It fits right in the wallet. It's convenient."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"And then they can just their free will."
01:10:59;01:11:01;"They can just spend on whatever they want."
01:11:01;01:11:04;"You can incorporate a lot of the themes that you've been speaking about."
01:11:04;01:11:05;"You know, right."
01:11:05;01:11:07;"I love this store. I love Home Depot."
01:11:07;01:11:09;"Or I know you like the second cup."
01:11:09;01:11:11;"Well, can I reference for you there?"
01:11:11;01:11:12;"Yeah, sure."
01:11:12;01:11:14;"I know you like Starbucks."
01:11:14;01:11:16;"Here's here's eighty five dollars."
01:11:16;01:11:17;"Great. That's cool."
01:11:17;01:11:20;"If if but I would only do it."
01:11:20;01:11:27;"Do you remember like when we were kids, like we'd have the one relative that gives us a gift certificate for a store we never go to."
01:11:27;01:11:31;"And we'd be like and it's like it's like it's a piece of paper."
01:11:31;01:11:33;"It's a it's just a piece of paper."
01:11:33;01:11:40;"But that piece of paper would be so like ponderous in our room and we'd just be like, oh, I don't know what to do with it."
01:11:40;01:11:42;"You can't throw it out because it's worth money."
01:11:42;01:11:44;"But like you just never want to go."
01:11:44;01:11:47;"But what you're saying, Seinfeld, is like the opposite of that."
01:11:47;01:11:55;"You you nail the fact that this one friend loves a coffee shop, even if it's a coffee shop or in and out burger."
01:11:55;01:11:58;"And you're like, dude, a year's worth of animal."
01:11:58;01:12:00;"And that's huge."
01:12:00;01:12:05;"Yeah, I have a gift certificate to the art of shaving that someone gave me."
01:12:05;01:12:07;"It has to be 20 years ago now."
01:12:07;01:12:08;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"I don't know, dude."
01:12:10;01:12:11;"I don't know."
01:12:11;01:12:19;"I get when you're getting to like a piece of paper and you're getting to a random place like that, then it's the opposite of thoughtful."
01:12:19;01:12:22;"Sometimes where it's like it's thoughtless."
01:12:22;01:12:23;"And you're right."
01:12:23;01:12:25;"I can't throw it out because I throw it out."
01:12:25;01:12:27;"It's literally burning money."
01:12:27;01:12:30;"I also don't know when I'm going to go to the art of shaving."
01:12:30;01:12:32;"At some point, the thought crosses your mind."
01:12:32;01:12:33;"How do I monetize this?"
01:12:33;01:12:36;"How do I still how do I take the money out of it?"
01:12:36;01:12:42;"Or what you do is you put it in a little compartment until you meet that one friend who's really big into shaving."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"And you're just like, here you go, bro."
01:12:44;01:12:45;"Take it."
01:12:45;01:12:48;"You can just lace them like you don't even have, you know."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"And then he shows up and it's expired."
01:12:50;01:12:54;"And now it's been $120 at the art of shaving."
01:12:54;01:12:59;"You know, people love all these like documentaries and shows about scammers."
01:12:59;01:13:01;"The Ann Delveys."
01:13:01;01:13:07;"But I'm also it makes you think there must be so many like small time scammers that are almost just kind of sweet."
01:13:07;01:13:21;"Like and now I'm picturing like a grandpa who picks a random store that he doesn't think maybe like maybe he's a little ashamed that he's bad at getting gifts or he lost
all his money at the track."
01:13:21;01:13:26;"And he starts making fake gift certificates for all the grandkids."
01:13:26;01:13:34;"And then for years, everybody's like, Grandpa, like, you know, I don't I don't really like go to that kind of store."
01:13:34;01:13:36;"And then somebody finally realized they were all fake."
01:13:36;01:13:39;"Because when you think about how many gift certificates go on."
01:13:39;01:13:41;"Get cashed in."
01:13:41;01:13:46;"I can totally picture this character who's making fake gift certificates and giving them."
01:13:46;01:13:51;"And also think about it, especially if you're in a big family, you give those out to everybody."
01:13:51;01:13:55;"Let's say only 25 percent of people even try them."
01:13:55;01:13:56;"It might even be less."
01:13:56;01:14:02;"So then your second cousin says, you know, I tried that Chili's gift certificate."
01:14:02;01:14:06;"I actually took to my wife and it didn't work."
01:14:06;01:14:11;"And you're like, how strange."
01:14:11;01:14:14;"So like you can so easily talk your way out of it."
01:14:14;01:14:18;"Everybody else doesn't even think about it."
01:14:18;01:14:25;"I'm not suggesting this, but I bet there are I bet there are people who do gift certificate scams just to kind of not have to worry about gift giving."
01:14:25;01:14:30;"Yeah. If you can make a fake ID, you can make a fake Blockbuster gift certificate."
01:14:30;01:14:31;"That's for sure."
01:14:31;01:14:32;"Blockbuster."
01:14:32;01:14:36;"That'd be a good one. Give people Blockbuster gift certificates."
01:14:36;01:14:38;"Or, yeah."
01:14:38;01:14:43;"I mean, back in the day, I mean, you know, although, yeah, that's funny you should say that."
01:14:43;01:14:46;"We're playing a show in Bend, Oregon."
01:14:46;01:14:49;"I never knew about that city, but apparently there's one Blockbuster there."
01:14:49;01:14:51;"Oh, that's where the last one is?"
01:14:51;01:14:52;"Yeah."
01:14:52;01:14:55;"Oh, that's crazy. We're going to Bend to this later in the year."
01:14:55;01:14:56;"I'm going to hit it up."
01:14:56;01:15:02;"I just finished a round of in-stores and I couldn't get over how many DVDs there still are."
01:15:02;01:15:04;"Like, yeah, they're back."
01:15:04;01:15:06;"They're back in a big way."
01:15:06;01:15:09;"Do you still watch DVDs in any capacity, Dave?"
01:15:09;01:15:11;"No, I don't even have anything to watch them."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"What do you mean they're back?"
01:15:13;01:15:14;"A lot of DVDs."
01:15:14;01:15:29;"Interestingly, I'll say that my cousin has gotten very into, she's a therapist, but she has this sort of side hustle that just because she loves movies and VHS, where
VHS have started to come back and they're very, either some are very expensive,"
01:15:29;01:15:35;"like they sell for hundreds, thousands of dollars, like an old VHS tape, mainly to like, you know, weird collectors and stuff."
01:15:35;01:15:43;"But what she does, because this is her thing, speaking of gift giving, is she'll like get people like their favorite movie on VHS, right?"
01:15:43;01:15:44;"Oh, that's cool."
01:15:44;01:15:48;"So they don't have one, but it's like so you can put up or like put on your bookshelf or whatever."
01:15:48;01:15:51;"So if she knows you have a favorite movie, she's like trolling eBay or whatever."
01:15:51;01:15:53;"And that's another one that's like hitting really hard."
01:15:53;01:15:56;"Huge. That's amazing."
01:15:56;01:16:01;"Get Jake Zodiac on VHS. I mean, you probably have it, Jake, right? Probably?"
01:16:01;01:16:10;"I actually don't. That's a gap in my collection. But actually, that movie came out in 2007. I wonder if there even is a VHS for that movie."
01:16:10;01:16:25;"They might have still been doing it. By the way, I just found from the year 2000 a Blockbuster gift card for $5 and they're selling it for $4.95 as a collectible."
01:16:25;01:16:46;"You know, not to make a common thread between DVDs and gifts, but I kid you not, Ezra, for my birthday in 2012, you bought me the original The Staircase on iTunes."
01:16:46;01:16:48;"On iTunes?"
01:16:48;01:16:49;"On iTunes."
01:16:49;01:16:50;"Oh, interesting."
01:16:50;01:16:54;"The original Staircase. This is before Netflix."
01:16:54;01:17:02;"That was ahead of its time. Yeah, that was like this culty, French doc series about the woman who died."
01:17:02;01:17:17;"And you gave that to me. I remember getting an email from you or from iTunes, Ezra sent you a gift and you clicked it and it downloads and it was from iTunes and it was The
Staircase."
01:17:17;01:17:19;"I remember this."
01:17:19;01:17:26;"We could do that for Jake. We could do that with Amazon Prime. You can order, you can spend $19.99. Jake, that's the gift. I mean, you would have that forever."
01:17:26;01:17:32;"Buy Jake a digital copy of Zodiac. By the way, found the VHS copy of Zodiac. $270."
01:17:32;01:17:37;"You guys just chip in? All chip in? How many of you, how many of this are you?"
01:17:37;01:17:40;"Why is it so much money?"
01:17:40;01:17:44;"Well, you're not including the Lunch Boys either. The Lunch Boys, once you get them chipping in."
01:17:44;01:17:51;"Ghostbusters VHS, factory sealed, 1984 on eBay for $500."
01:17:51;01:17:53;"I was going to say $700."
01:17:53;01:17:58;"$500? $500 for a sealed Ghostbusters VHS."
01:17:58;01:18:01;"That makes total sense though. I mean, that makes sense."
01:18:01;01:18:06;"Does it? You're just looking at the spine of the movie on your shelf."
01:18:06;01:18:11;"You know, you do. Go to a Comic-Con, if Dan Aykroyd's there or whatever, get Dan Aykroyd's sig."
01:18:11;01:18:12;"There you go."
01:18:12;01:18:14;"Suddenly you're doubling your value."
01:18:14;01:18:17;"Suddenly that thing is worth $%&#."
01:18:17;01:18:19;"No. No."
01:18:19;01:18:24;"Oh, but you know what I just remembered, speaking of gift giving, you know who has kind of a themed gift giving?"
01:18:24;01:18:30;"It's Seinfeld. Every time Seinfeld's been to my house, he brought me some type of celebrity-based alcohol."
01:18:30;01:18:31;"Oh, that's right."
01:18:31;01:18:32;"There you go. There you go."
01:18:32;01:18:33;"I did. That's right."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"You brought Every Time's whiskey."
01:18:35;01:18:36;"Yes."
01:18:36;01:18:38;"Florida Georgia Lion's whiskey."
01:18:38;01:18:39;"Yes."
01:18:39;01:18:41;"And recently you brought Walton Goggins whiskey."
01:18:41;01:18:43;"The Walton Goggins whiskey."
01:18:43;01:18:48;"Yes. Wow. You're aware. I wasn't familiar with your game."
01:18:48;01:18:51;"Yeah, that's a good one. That's a good theme."
01:18:51;01:18:58;"And for anybody out there who's looking for those kind of like a gift in the $20 to $40 range,"
01:18:58;01:19:05;"if you know somebody who you could start this tomorrow with a friend of yours,"
01:19:05;01:19:09;"is I bring you celebrity-themed whiskeys because there are so many."
01:19:09;01:19:11;"Metallica has one."
01:19:11;01:19:20;"Wow. Or books. I have one friend where every Christmas it's like a musician's book."
01:19:20;01:19:25;"So it's like the Rick Ross book. It's a Pitbull book. The Will.I.Am book."
01:19:25;01:19:32;"And it's hilarious. And that's the thing. And it's like you end up reading parts of it and it's so funny."
01:19:32;01:19:35;"And that's in the $12 range."
01:19:35;01:19:42;"I will say it's very enjoyable going to the store and trying to determine what the funniest celebrity alcohol is."
01:19:42;01:19:44;"Yeah, that's so cool."
01:19:44;01:19:50;"We could talk about this all day. See this time, time crisis, Club Random just works out."
01:19:50;01:19:54;"On all your press tour, Dave, is this the only one where you did a gift-giving guide?"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"A late-winter gift-giving guide?"
01:19:56;01:19:57;"Oh, perfect."
01:19:57;01:19:59;"Yep. Absolutely. Hands down."
01:19:59;01:20:00;"It all works out."
01:20:00;01:20:02;"It all works out. It's great."
01:20:02;01:20:04;"Well, great to have you on as always."
01:20:04;01:20:05;"Thank you so much."
01:20:05;01:20:13;"Great to see you guys. Great to meet you. Seinfeld, we've never met before. Jake, I feel like we've met a few times."
01:20:13;01:20:16;"I think briefly at an art gallery or something."
01:20:16;01:20:17;"Yeah."
01:20:17;01:20:18;"Yeah, that's right."
01:20:18;01:20:19;"That's right."
01:20:19;01:20:20;"Dave, it was great seeing you again."
01:20:20;01:20:21;"Yeah, great to see you."
01:20:21;01:20:27;"Yeah, good to see you. Thank you guys for having me. Ezra, I'm going to be waiting. I'll wait for that text."
01:20:27;01:20:29;"For that part, for the part two."
01:20:29;01:20:30;"Back half."
01:20:30;01:20:39;"Review of the back half. And everybody else, check out the new Chromio album, Adult Contemporary. See them on tour. One of the best shows you can catch."
01:20:39;01:20:41;"Thank you so much, guys."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"See you soon. Thanks for coming on."
01:20:43;01:20:44;"Bye. Thank you."
01:20:44;01:20:45;"Bye."
01:22:17;01:22:22;"I don't know about you guys, but I'm inspired to give some gifts."
01:22:22;01:22:30;"I'm going to start taking notes. I'm going to start planting seeds. And I'm going to give thoughtful gifts."
01:22:30;01:22:36;"Yeah, no, that's what I'm going to aim for. I felt really like a real dirtbag listening to that conversation."
01:22:36;01:22:44;"That concludes the Time Crisis late winter gift guide. Thank you to Dave Maklovich. Let's get in the top five."
01:22:44;01:22:51;"It's time for the Top Five on iTunes."
01:22:51;01:23:01;"We were planning on talking about We Are the World. Everybody's been talking about We Are the World because of the documentary on Netflix."
01:23:01;01:23:15;"And we do want to go deep on We Are the World. But we still are going to kind of set the stage for We Are the World by comparing the top five hits of today with the top five hits
of 1985, the year We Are the World was released."
01:23:15;01:23:20;"Real quick, Jake, do you remember We Are the World coming out? You would have been eight."
01:23:20;01:23:24;"Yeah, I do. End of story."
01:23:24;01:23:26;"Next question."
01:23:26;01:23:27;"I cut, you know."
01:23:27;01:23:29;"Yeah, I remember. Next question."
01:23:29;01:23:36;"I don't remember like a whole lot. I mean, I just, I didn't really know. I knew who Michael Jackson was and that's maybe about it."
01:23:36;01:23:41;"Right. At eight, you didn't know Kim Carnes or Willie Nelson?"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"No, I wasn't familiar with Al Jarreau."
01:23:43;01:23:45;"All right. So you just remember the song?"
01:23:45;01:23:52;"Yeah, I just kind of remember it being like a big kind of, it wasn't just like a normal song. It was like, you know."
01:23:52;01:23:54;"You understood there's some major."
01:23:54;01:24:00;"But it's not like something that like, like, it's not like we had it in my house. Like my parents did not have that record."
01:24:00;01:24:02;"Right. You catch it on the radio or TV."
01:24:02;01:24:03;"Yeah."
01:24:03;01:24:09;"We had a cassette. Do you remember the B side of that cassette? There was a Canadian We Are the World?"
01:24:09;01:24:10;"Oh, no."
01:24:10;01:24:12;"I mean, maybe that must be in Canada."
01:24:12;01:24:13;"Only."
01:24:13;01:24:15;"No, no, it was on the."
01:24:15;01:24:20;"Yeah, yeah. I believe it was called Northern Lights and it had Brian Adams on it."
01:24:20;01:24:23;"Okay. That was the B side of We Are the World in Canada?"
01:24:23;01:24:26;"Yeah, we had. Oh, you know what it was called? It was called Tears Are Not Enough."
01:24:26;01:24:37;"Brian Adams, songwriter. Oh, well, Anne-Marie, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Corey Hart, Geddy Lee, Burton Cummings."
01:24:37;01:24:47;"So they got. Okay, wow. Yeah, I didn't even really realize I saw the doc that We Are the World was just American artists."
01:24:47;01:24:50;"No Brits, no Canadians."
01:24:50;01:24:56;"Oh, I'm glad that Neil and Joni had their shot with Brian Adams a little later on."
01:24:56;01:24:57;"Corey Hart."
01:24:57;01:24:58;"Yeah."
01:24:58;01:25:01;"Okay. When we do our We Are the World ep, we'll go deep on that."
01:25:01;01:25:02;"Exactly."
01:25:02;01:25:09;"All of them. We'll do the We Are the World for Haiti remix, which deserves quite a bit of conversation."
01:25:09;01:25:15;"I'd also throw in All in the Same Gang, which I think is sort of what we are, the world of."
01:25:15;01:25:17;"The rap We Are the World?"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"That's the rap We Are the World."
01:25:19;01:25:24;"Wait, what's the, what do you call these? Charity singles, all-star charity singles."
01:25:24;01:25:37;"Okay, we'll do that. We'll give it the time it deserves. But for the top five, the number five song this week in '85, ""Foreigner,"" ""I Wanna Know What Love Is."" Great song."
01:26:00;01:26:05;"I didn't know this. The choir is the New Jersey Mass Choir singing backing vocals."
01:26:05;01:26:07;"I've done this one karaoke a lot."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"Oh yeah? You're a fan?"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"Of this song? Absolutely."
01:26:11;01:26:16;"Also, this one, there's so many schmaltzy kind of ballads in this era."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"Yeah."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"This one is just a cut above. It has real emotion."
01:26:19;01:26:20;"Yeah."
01:26:34;01:26:38;"Jake, what are your other go-to karaoke songs?"
01:26:38;01:26:44;"I'll do Bob Seger, ""We've Got Tonight."" I like a ballad."
01:26:44;01:26:47;"That's a good song."
01:26:47;01:26:50;"I'll do Billy Joel, ""Honesty."""
01:26:50;01:26:52;"Love it."
01:27:04;01:27:09;"I like this. Nick Jones is talking about writing the song."
01:27:09;01:27:15;"""I Wanna Know What Love Is"" came at three in the morning sometime in 1984."
01:27:15;01:27:18;"It's so deep. I don't know where it came from."
01:27:18;01:27:22;"I mean, consider it a gift that was sent through me."
01:27:22;01:27:26;"I think there was something bigger than me behind it. I mean, I feel it."
01:27:39;01:27:46;"You know, Nick Jones was married to Mark Ronson's mom for a very long time."
01:27:46;01:27:48;"I did not know that."
01:27:48;01:27:51;"I think they maybe are still together."
01:27:51;01:27:56;"But I wonder if young Mark was around in 1984."
01:27:56;01:27:58;"How old is Mark Ronson?"
01:27:58;01:28:02;"I mean, Mark must have been born in the mid '70s."
01:28:02;01:28:06;"So little Mark was asleep down the hall."
01:28:06;01:28:09;"I always worked late at night when everyone left."
01:28:09;01:28:11;"""Don't Stop Ringing."" That's what Nick says."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"That would make total sense."
01:28:13;01:28:18;"Little Mark comes down and stepdad is hanging in the kitchen."
01:28:18;01:28:21;"Maybe getting ready to go to bed."
01:28:21;01:28:24;"And he's like, ""What's up, man?"""
01:28:24;01:28:30;"It's like, ""I think I just wrote one of the best songs I'm ever going to write in my whole life."""
01:28:30;01:28:33;"All right. I'm getting ready for school. What's it called?"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"It's called ""I Wanna Know What Love Is."""
01:28:35;01:28:38;"We got to get Mark Ronson back on the show. He's one of our earliest guests."
01:28:38;01:28:40;"Okay, make a mental note."
01:28:40;01:28:47;"Let's ask if Mark saw his stepfather the morning after he wrote ""I Wanna Know What Love Is."""
01:28:47;01:28:49;"You know what I also just realized?"
01:28:49;01:28:52;"This is something for the Vampire fans."
01:28:52;01:28:56;"The opening line of this song is, ""I've gotta take a little time."""
01:28:56;01:29:01;"The opening line of our song, ""M79,"" is, ""Gonna take a little time."""
01:29:01;01:29:04;"Which I'm sure in some way was inspired by this."
01:29:04;01:29:07;"I remember the first time I heard that song."
01:29:07;01:29:09;"That's exactly what I thought."
01:29:09;01:29:11;"A little tip of the hat to..."
01:29:11;01:29:13;"I was like, ""Oh, a little foreigner love here."""
01:29:13;01:29:15;"Okay, didn't see that coming."
01:29:15;01:29:19;"Now, hold on. I said, ""I'm gonna take a little time."""
01:29:19;01:29:24;"It's a little different, but yeah, still opening line. Great song."
01:29:24;01:29:27;"It's gonna take a little time."
01:29:27;01:29:32;"The number five song this week in 2024 is Taylor Swift's ""Cruel Summer."""
01:29:32;01:29:35;"Seinfeld, you're a resident Swifty."
01:29:35;01:29:37;"Oh, yeah, that's a hit."
01:29:37;01:29:39;"What's the story with ""Cruel Summer?"""
01:29:39;01:29:42;"My understanding is that right before the pandemic,"
01:29:42;01:29:48;"this was supposed to be a single off of whatever album it was."
01:29:48;01:29:51;"Somehow it didn't end up coming out as a single."
01:29:51;01:29:55;"Then there was this groundswell of support for this song over the years."
01:29:55;01:29:59;"Oh, because of the tour, and the tour pushed it over the edge."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"Something like that, yes."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"It was officially released as a single."

01:59:07;01:59:10;"Well, I guess maybe because he already cleared it."
01:59:10;01:59:14;"An interpolation means you played something yourself."
01:59:14;01:59:15;"Okay."
01:59:15;01:59:19;"So you still need to clear the publishing. I don't know."
01:59:19;01:59:20;"Okay."
01:59:27;01:59:31;"Yeah, they're really going in on this ride a carnival."

02:00:43;02:00:45;"I spent some time with the family."
02:00:45;02:00:46;"I went to the movies."
02:00:46;02:00:48;"I rode a carnival."
02:00:48;02:00:52;"And I had a really nice dinner with an old friend."""
02:00:52;02:00:55;"And just see if anybody says anything."
02:00:55;02:00:56;"You rode a carnival?"
02:00:56;02:00:57;"I'm sorry, you rode--"
02:00:57;02:00:59;"What'd you ride at the carnival?"
02:00:59;02:01:01;"No, I just rode the whole carnival."
02:01:01;02:01:02;"Oh, no, no, no."
02:01:02;02:01:09;"Oh, you're talking about like a Ferris wheel?"
02:01:09;02:01:13;"Listen to me, I rode carnival."
02:01:13;02:01:16;"Maybe they mean like carnival cruise line."
02:01:16;02:01:17;"Oh, maybe."
02:01:17;02:01:19;"Oh, that makes more sense."
02:01:19;02:01:22;"Like she's saying, ""I rode it like a slow giant ship."""
02:01:22;02:01:25;"Like a carnival cruise ship."
02:01:25;02:01:27;"Yeah, it took about two weeks."
02:01:27;02:01:29;"I took the--"
02:01:29;02:01:32;"She took her whole family on a carnival cruise."
02:01:32;02:01:34;"Buffet scene was sick."
02:01:34;02:01:37;"I drive highway."
02:01:37;02:01:39;"I ride carnival."
02:01:39;02:01:42;"I eat restaurant."
02:01:42;02:01:45;"How was your weekend?"
02:01:45;02:01:47;"You have a good time?"
02:01:47;02:01:49;"Yeah, man, I ate a restaurant."
02:01:49;02:01:52;"Got some quality time with the fam."
02:01:52;02:01:54;"I drive highway."
02:01:54;02:01:58;"I watch Stadium Great Game."
02:01:58;02:02:01;"I play stadium."
02:02:01;02:02:03;"I play stadium."
02:02:03;02:02:06;"I play stadium."
02:02:06;02:02:11;"I could almost see that like instead of saying like I played video games too,"
02:02:11;02:02:14;"just say, ""I play television."
02:02:14;02:02:17;"I eat kitchen."
02:02:17;02:02:20;"I ride carnival."""
02:02:20;02:02:23;"I eat kitchen."
02:02:23;02:02:33;"But in Soviet Union, kitchen eat you."
02:02:33;02:02:34;"Interesting."
02:02:34;02:02:35;"This is like big--"
02:02:35;02:02:38;"I mean, I guess because Connie's always been a big streamer,"
02:02:38;02:02:40;"and I guess there's a Taylor Swift reference in this."
02:02:40;02:02:42;"We don't have time for all this."
02:02:42;02:02:43;"Yeah, too deep."
02:02:43;02:02:44;"All right."
02:02:44;02:02:46;"I hope everybody had a great weekend."
02:02:46;02:02:47;"I hope--"
02:02:47;02:02:48;"We're out."
02:02:48;02:02:49;"All right."
02:02:49;02:02:50;"Thank you to Dave Maklovich."
02:02:50;02:02:52;"We'll see you in a couple weeks."
02:02:52;02:02:53;"Peace."
02:02:53;02:02:56;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
