00:00;00:13;"Thurston Moore, John Mayer, Jerry Garcia, Bono, X-Ray Spex, Blondie."
00:13;00:21;"This is a very special episode of our program. We talk jam bands, noise music,"
00:21;00:29;"and so much more on Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
30:59;31:04;"Seinfeld, can you reach out to Trey Anastasiou and Thurston Moore and see if they'll be down to talk about pedals?"
31:04;31:08;"We won't bring up the controversial interview, but we just want to talk about pedals."
31:08;31:09;"Sure."
31:09;31:10;"Thank you."
36:30;36:33;"It is pretty dead. The lyrics are pretty dead."
36:33;36:34;"Totally."
36:57;37:00;"This sounds so much like pavement."
37:00;37:01;"Oh, totally."
37:01;37:08;"But I don't remember, is this unique to a Sonic Youth song?"
37:08;37:12;"It's maybe a little more spare than a lot of their stuff."
37:12;37:16;"It's so funny hearing this song and just thinking that there's somewheres like,"
37:16;37:20;"""We'll give fish our audience, but we're not going to get any of it."""
37:20;37:21;"I think it's..."
37:21;37:23;"[Laughter]"
37:23;37:25;"They do nothing for us."
37:41;37:44;"Thurston was picturing a Fish fan who would hear this and be like,"
37:44;37:46;"""My mind is f***ing blown."""
37:46;37:49;"But see, keep in mind, for the Deadhead, they're like,"
37:49;37:51;"""All right, now you're going to prove yourself."""
37:51;37:52;"Okay, let's go."
37:52;37:53;"I like the song."
37:53;37:57;"All right."
37:57;37:59;"Waiting for the solo to start."
38:13;38:15;"We're just getting warmed up still."
38:15;38:16;"Right."
38:16;38:17;"They're just kind of vamping still."
38:17;38:20;"No, for the Deadhead, the solo hasn't started yet."
38:20;38:22;"Yeah, we're waiting for it."
38:22;38:25;"In Thurston's mind, he's been soloing for 30 seconds."
38:33;38:34;"Okay."
38:34;38:35;"Ooh."
38:53;38:54;"Textural."
38:57;39:00;"Deadhead's starting to kind of fade on this a little bit maybe."
39:00;39:03;"Deadhead's like, ""I might go get another beer."""
39:03;39:04;"Yeah."
39:10;39:13;"There hasn't been a single run yet, you know?"
39:13;39:14;"Yeah."
39:21;39:24;"I mean, I would love to hear the Dead cover this song."
39:24;39:26;"I think that would be fascinating."
39:26;39:29;"Maybe Richard Pictures should cover this."
39:29;39:30;"That's tight."
39:41;39:44;"I'm going to say something controversial because, again, I like Sonic Youth a lot,"
39:44;39:45;"and I like this song."
39:45;39:49;"But actually, I feel like a lot of people who hate jam band music"
39:49;39:52;"think jam band music sounds like this."
39:52;39:54;"You know what I mean?"
39:54;39:55;"Totally."
39:55;39:57;"Like a little aimless."
39:57;39:58;"Yeah."
39:58;40:00;"Where's the focus here?"
40:00;40:02;"When people are being mean about jamming, they always say,"
40:02;40:06;"""I don't want to listen to a bunch of stoners [beep] around on guitar."""
40:06;40:10;"Whereas if you actually listen to Jerry, you're like, ""Well, [beep] around."""
40:10;40:15;"At worst, it's like watching Michael Jordan just kind of shoot around at the court."
40:15;40:18;"There's still going to be a lot of artistry there."
40:20;40:21;"Oh."
40:21;40:23;"We haven't got a single run yet."
40:52;40:55;"Wrong Warlocks, Thurston."
40:55;40:57;"It's the wrong Warlocks, man."
40:57;40:59;"Oh, I dig it, man."
40:59;41:01;"So they're doing kind of a drone thing on this thing,"
41:01;41:03;"but the next song is going to be--"
41:03;41:05;"they're going to bust out their Scarlet style."
41:05;41:07;"I think maybe the thing that Thurston also doesn't understand"
41:07;41:10;"is that this is reminiscent of The Grateful Dead."
41:10;41:18;"It's reminiscent of space, which is one of the less cherished parts."
41:18;41:20;"There's no Dead fan who said,"
41:20;41:23;"""I wish that they would just do three hours of space."""
41:23;41:24;"I mean, there might be."
41:24;41:26;"It would be an unpopular opinion."
41:26;41:27;"Yeah."
41:31;41:34;"[Applause]"
42:48;42:50;"I like this song, and actually, I do feel--"
42:50;42:53;"I like when Sonic Youth gets noisy and droney."
42:53;42:55;"It's just, you know, at the end of the day,"
42:55;42:57;"Sonic Youth is Sonic Youth."
42:57;42:59;"They're not a jam band."
43:06;43:08;"They slowed down a lot."
43:08;43:09;"Yes."
43:13;43:15;"Well, yeah, no, I love this."
43:15;43:18;"I just love picturing the Fish fan or the Dead fan being like,"
43:18;43:20;"""Okay, well, the next song is going to be, like, up."""
43:20;43:22;"And this is like, ""Nope."""
43:24;43:28;"I remember that Sonic Youth show at Lollapalooza."
43:28;43:30;"I've seen that, like, a few times."
43:30;43:35;"And, like, the last, like, 35 minutes was just a wall of, like, noise."
43:35;43:38;"Like, on the main stage at night."
43:38;43:42;"Just, like, after seeing, like, Cypress Hill and stuff."
43:42;43:44;"[Laughter]"
43:44;43:47;"Like, I think, oh, yeah, Hole played."
43:47;43:49;"I think Sonic Youth maybe closed the night."
43:49;43:50;"I don't remember, really."
43:50;43:56;"But, like, definitely, like, saw Cypress Hill and Hole on the big stage."
43:56;43:59;"And then it was just, like, deep nighttime at this point."
43:59;44:02;"And it's just, like, 35 minutes of just [snoring]"
44:02;44:04;"[Laughter]"
44:04;44:06;"It's just like, damn, man."
44:06;44:08;"Not tight."
44:08;44:11;"At the end of the day, there's always going to be--"
44:11;44:17;"Sonic Youth is--they get into noise music, you know, which is just, like, is cool."
44:17;44:20;"And, actually, I think noise music is a beautiful tradition."
44:20;44:21;"You know, I grew up in New Jersey."
44:21;44:24;"I've been to noise music shows in New Brunswick."
44:24;44:27;"I've checked out the Rutgers noise scene."
44:27;44:30;"And there is something, like, tight about, like, you go into a basement,"
44:30;44:34;"just, like, a bunch of people, like, sitting on the floor with, like, pedals"
44:34;44:36;"and just, like, making crazy weird sounds."
44:36;44:38;"It is cool."
44:38;44:42;"Drinking, like, a room temperature PBR and it's just, like, so loud."
44:42;44:43;"Yeah."
44:43;44:45;"Yeah, no, you could definitely go deaf."
44:45;44:49;"I mean, God, yeah, you have to--you need earplugs."
44:49;44:51;"There's definitely some people with long-term hearing damage"
44:51;44:55;"from going to one basement noise show in New Brunswick."
45:07;45:11;"I would go to noise shows and stand outside the noise show."
45:11;45:14;"Okay, so you would kind of just hear it through the basement walls."
45:14;45:17;"I walk in for, like, 40 seconds and there'd be, like, four people--"
45:17;45:21;"there'd be, like, 15 people kind of milling outside the noise show."
45:21;45:25;"Then you walk in and it's so loud and there's, like, four people actually in--"
45:25;45:26;"Yeah."
45:26;45:28;"--in the room or the--"
45:28;45:30;"Which is kind of amazing performance art."
45:30;45:34;"Like, I wonder if there ever was somebody who truly--"
45:34;45:38;"I mean, who truly was, like, into noise music and the dead"
45:38;45:41;"and, like, was doing just, like, a basement noise show"
45:41;45:43;"in, like, Bloomington, Indiana or something"
45:43;45:47;"and just, like, the first 15 minutes was, like, [mimics noise]"
45:47;45:49;"just, like, crazy feedback."
45:49;45:52;"And then it kind of got quiet and crescendoed"
45:52;45:54;"and then got quiet again."
45:54;45:56;"And then just they pulled out a guitar"
45:56;46:00;"and then just did, like, just, like, a perfect, like, Scarlet solo."
46:00;46:03;"I mean, my buddy Adam Forkner would do stuff like that."
46:03;46:06;"He had a band called White Rainbow and it would be--"
46:06;46:07;"he would marry that."
46:07;46:08;"He would marry the tendencies."
46:08;46:11;"I would be waiting for the solo and I'd be the only one--"
46:11;46:13;"And he'd be like, ""Dude, I'm doing this for you"
46:13;46:15;"""'cause you love these solos,"" I'm just saying."
46:15;46:17;"'Cause it would be, like, sort of, like--"
46:17;46:18;"A melodic solo."
46:18;46:19;"Yeah, oh yeah, beautiful."
46:19;46:21;"And everyone else thought it was kind of funny."
46:21;46:25;"And I was like, ""Forkner, that's the best part of the show, the solos."""
46:45;46:48;"It's as old as time itself, is this--"
46:48;46:51;"I can relate to both things, and I'm sure we all can as artists."
46:51;46:57;"There's the person who woodsheds and develops, like, the crazy technical ability"
46:57;47:00;"and they work their ass off so that they can just, like--"
47:00;47:06;"You know, if it was painting, paint photorealistic, like, perfect images."
47:06;47:13;"If it's in music, there's the person who can solo in any mode, any key, any style."
47:13;47:15;"They can tell a story that way."
47:15;47:17;"And then you're gonna have the other people who are just like,"
47:17;47:23;"""What I care about is texture and vibe and coolness."""
47:23;47:27;"And yeah, all those years you spent, like, learning all the modes,"
47:27;47:29;"I don't give a sh--."
47:29;47:31;"It doesn't have passion."
47:31;47:33;"And when I f-- plug in and--"
47:33;47:35;"That's transcendent."
47:35;47:37;"And, you know, you can understand both sides of it."
47:37;47:40;"You know, the Thurston's are just like, ""Oh, God, who gives a sh--?"""
47:40;47:44;"That you can, like, you know, do a solo where you, like,"
47:44;47:47;"sound like you're playing country and then the next minute you sound like you're,"
47:47;47:48;"you know, Ted Nugent."
47:48;47:50;"Like, ""Who gives a sh--? That's not cool to me."""
47:50;47:53;"And then, you know, from that point of view, they might be like,"
47:53;47:56;"""Yeah, but you're a hater. You can't even do it, man."
47:56;47:58;"You don't know your fundamentals."""
47:58;48:02;"And frankly, what you do-- I could do what you do."
48:02;48:04;"My kid could do that, man."
48:04;48:06;"These are classic tendencies that are at war with each other."
48:06;48:08;"Yeah. My kid could do that."
48:29;48:31;"I like this part of the song."
48:31;48:34;"Minute nine of Diamond Sea? My kid could do that."
48:34;48:36;"How far into the song are we?"
48:36;48:38;"Yeah."
48:38;48:40;"Thirteen and a half minutes."
48:40;48:43;"Okay. I believe in this song is 17 minutes?"
48:43;48:45;"I think it's 20."
48:45;48:48;"[Laughter]"
48:48;48:50;"Nineteen and a half."
48:50;48:51;"Whoa."
48:51;48:53;"Okay, cool. We got six minutes left."
48:53;48:56;"They're just different things, man. They're just different things."
49:04;49:07;"I think Trey's a very nice guy, so I don't think he would have harsh words,"
49:07;49:10;"but I imagine if Trey was listening to this, he'd be like, ""This is cool."
49:10;49:13;"However, I could do this in a second."
49:13;49:15;"I could call up the boys."
49:15;49:20;"We could do a better version of this with Page doing some interesting synth work."
49:20;49:23;"We could do a better version than this."
49:23;49:26;"Literally, you want us to do a song like this?"
49:26;49:28;"All we need is 20 minutes. We could do it."
49:28;49:32;"However, Hand Sonic Youth, hell, he's common."
49:32;49:35;"A simple one. They wouldn't even know what to do with it."
49:35;49:40;"From his POV, this idea that you have something to offer me"
49:40;49:44;"and I have nothing to offer you, you got it backwards, buddy."
49:44;49:47;"Yeah, and then Thurston would be like, ""Well, you couldn't write the pavement part."""
49:47;49:49;"[Laughter]"
49:49;49:51;"That's really funny when you think about it."
49:51;49:55;"Just imagine this is an actual dialogue where Trey's just like,"
49:55;49:57;"""I could do all that feedback s---. We do that."
49:57;50:00;"It's part of-- We do that all the time, but you couldn't do what I do."
50:00;50:02;"You couldn't rip melodic solos."""
50:02;50:05;"And then Thurston goes, ""But you couldn't write the pavement part."""
50:05;50:08;"And then Trey's like, ""Man, you hear what you just said?"
50:08;50:11;"I couldn't write the pavement part. You're not in pavement, man."
50:11;50:14;"You're in Sonic Youth. Case closed, buddy."""
50:43;51:08;"[Applause]"
51:08;51:12;"The thing that always bummed me out about the song is I love that sound in the beginning."
51:12;51:14;"[Singing]"
51:14;51:21;"If around now, Thurston just busted out a melodic solo with that sound."
51:21;51:26;"[Singing]"
51:26;51:29;"I wonder if that's Lee Rinaldo doing that part or if it's Sonic or if it's Thurston."
51:29;51:31;"Oh, that could be Lee Rinaldo."
51:31;51:35;"You know who really needs to weigh in is Lee Rinaldo because he actually was a Grateful Dead fan growing up."
51:35;51:40;"I wonder if he read this Index magazine interview and later he just said to Thurston,"
51:40;51:43;"""You know what? Cool it with that s***, man."""
51:43;51:47;"The deadhead in him suddenly got a little bit offended."
51:47;51:48;"He was just like, ""Dude."""
51:48;51:50;"Bro, come on. Stand your ground."
51:50;51:52;"Bro, it's different tendencies, man."
51:52;51:54;"Different warlocks."
52:09;52:14;"It really is profound that the Velvets and the dead were both called the warlocks."
52:14;52:17;"You know what that is, man? That's called the glitch in the Matrix."
52:17;52:22;"Yeah, there's something there that's very cosmic and heavy."
52:22;52:25;"I was reading about the new Matrix film."
52:25;52:27;"Yeah, I watched it."
52:27;52:30;"I watched most of it. It had some moments."
52:30;52:35;"But you know how they use ""This might be the hardest to listen to"" TC ever?"
52:35;52:40;"Just us talking over the noisiest part of the Diamond Sea."
52:40;52:45;"But I guess the Wachowskis, the writing/directing team,"
52:45;52:51;"they used ""White Rabbit"" not only because it's this psychedelic song"
52:51;52:55;"referencing Alice in Wonderland and entering a new world, which is very Matrix,"
52:55;52:59;"but also because one of the—I didn't know this—"
52:59;53:03;"one of the big hippie clubs in San Francisco in the '60s"
53:03;53:06;"where the Jefferson Airplane used to play was called the Matrix."
53:06;53:07;"Oh, wow."
53:07;53:09;"Seinfeld, can you do a number crunch?"
53:09;53:14;"The Grateful Dead must have played at the Matrix in SF in the '60s."
53:14;53:16;"We could be onto something."
53:16;53:19;"There were two warlocks. There was a club called the Matrix."
53:19;53:23;"That was a glitch in the Matrix. There was only supposed to be one warlock."
53:23;53:26;"The programmer was only meant to do one warlock,"
53:26;53:29;"and they were going to marry the tendencies of the Grateful Dead"
53:29;53:31;"and the Velvet Underground."
53:31;53:34;"But there was a glitch, and it got doubled."
53:34;53:36;"And then we ended up with two warlocks."
53:36;53:38;"The results are in."
53:38;53:42;"The Grateful Dead did play the Matrix December 1, 1966."
53:42;53:44;"Early, early days."
53:44;53:47;"Did the Velvet Underground ever play the Matrix?"
53:47;53:48;"Whoa."
53:48;53:51;"Time takes its crazy toll."
53:51;53:52;"I got the results."
53:52;53:55;"The Velvet Underground did play the Matrix."
53:55;53:57;"Oh, my God. This is getting spooky."
53:57;54:02;"Looks like-- You know what? Give me a sec. Give me a sec here."
54:02;54:04;"Standing by."
54:04;54:15;"I hate to be a backseat driver,"
54:15;54:18;"but I just also think it would have been a little more jammed"
54:18;54:21;"if during the noisy part it started to get like--"
54:21;54:23;"[imitates car engine]"
54:27;54:30;"Time takes its crazy toll."
54:30;54:32;"Some dynamics."
54:32;54:34;"Yeah, it came back in with--"
54:34;54:35;"The results are in."
54:35;54:40;"The Velvet Underground played the Matrix December 26 and 27, 1969."
54:40;54:43;"They actually released an album, a live album,"
54:43;54:45;"called The Complete Matrix Tapes."
54:45;54:48;"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
54:48;54:50;"This is too freaky."
54:50;54:52;"There were two bands called the Warlocks."
54:52;54:54;"One became the Grateful Dead,"
54:54;54:56;"and the other became the Velvet Underground."
54:56;54:59;"They both played at a club in San Francisco in the 1960s"
54:59;55:00;"called The Matrix."
55:00;55:03;"Wait, do all the Matrix movies take place in San Francisco?"
55:03;55:05;"No, I think it's like a generic city, right?"
55:05;55:06;"Like a Gotham?"
55:06;55:08;"Or I don't know. I'm not a Matrix fan."
55:08;55:09;"You're right."
55:09;55:12;"They do take place in an invented metropolis"
55:12;55:14;"known as Mega City."
55:14;55:16;"Oh. All right. Good call, Jake."
55:16;55:17;"Mega City."
55:17;55:18;"Inventive."
55:18;55:20;"Yeah, that's heavy, man."
55:20;55:24;"Okay, but again, to go back to our imaginary hippie,"
55:24;55:26;"I'm not saying the hippie would have hated it."
55:26;55:28;"I'm not saying the Deadhead would have hated it,"
55:28;55:30;"because again, all I'm taking issue with"
55:30;55:32;"is some of what Thurston said in this interview."
55:32;55:35;"I'm definitely not taking issue with his artistry."
55:35;55:38;"But again, this Deadhead in mourning,"
55:38;55:41;"late '95, listens to Diamond Sea."
55:41;55:43;"They're just going to say, I mean,"
55:43;55:45;"there are elements of that that reminded me"
55:45;55:47;"of like a kind of a harsh space,"
55:47;55:49;"but I'm not getting Dead vibes off of it."
55:49;55:51;"I was waiting. I waited 20 minutes"
55:51;55:54;"for a melodic narrative solo,"
55:54;55:55;"and I didn't get it."
55:55;55:57;"Yeah, it's going to be Phish."
55:57;55:58;"Wait, wait, wait. Hold up."
55:58;56:00;"One of the filming locations of The Matrix"
56:00;56:02;"was San Francisco."
56:02;56:04;"I mean, it's so freaky."
56:04;56:06;"Can you imagine that we actually proved"
56:06;56:08;"that we live in a simulation"
56:08;56:11;"by reading a 1998 Thurston Moore interview"
56:11;56:13;"about the band Phish?"
56:13;56:14;"I just realized something."
56:14;56:17;"The Matrix first movie came out in '99."
56:17;56:20;"If you turn '99 upside down, it's '66."
56:20;56:22;"Whoa, freaky."
56:22;56:24;"This is a real lid blower."
56:24;56:25;"And actually, when you think about it,"
56:25;56:27;"it probably took them a few years"
56:27;56:29;"to write the movie."
56:29;56:30;"Nick, you work in show biz."
56:30;56:32;"If a movie comes out in '99,"
56:32;56:34;"you're working on that minimum."
56:34;56:37;"You're starting work minimum '96, right?"
56:37;56:38;"Minimum."
56:38;56:39;"I mean, with the amount of drafts"
56:39;56:41;"that would take place,"
56:41;56:43;"I mean, those writers could be working on it"
56:43;56:45;"for significantly longer."
56:45;56:47;"You're thinking maybe they started"
56:47;56:50;"the first seeds of an idea of The Matrix"
56:50;56:52;"started on August 9th?"
56:52;56:53;"August 9th."
56:53;56:55;"August 9th, '95."
56:55;56:57;"The day after Jerry died."
56:57;57:01;"Because they literally could not have opened"
57:01;57:02;"that can of worms"
57:02;57:06;"while Jerry was still manifested in this reality."
57:06;57:09;"Frankly, I could see one of the"
57:09;57:11;"Wachowski sisters."
57:11;57:12;"How do you say that pronounced?"
57:12;57:14;"I think it's Wachowski."
57:14;57:17;"Just sort of like taking a nap"
57:17;57:19;"or maybe eating lunch."
57:19;57:21;"And Jerry dies and they're like,"
57:21;57:22;"""Oh, I have an idea."""
57:22;57:24;"You know, sort of one of those not knowing."
57:24;57:26;"You know, just sort of cosmic."
57:26;57:28;"Yeah, woke up and it's like kind of on the--"
57:28;57:30;"I just had the craziest idea for a movie."
57:30;57:33;"Wait, what was the name of that club in SF"
57:33;57:34;"in the late '60s?"
57:34;57:36;"I think The Dead played there"
57:36;57:37;"and The Velvet Underground."
57:37;57:38;"Oh, The Matrix."
57:38;57:41;"I was just thinking about that club."
57:41;57:43;"I heard some good live Velvet Underground"
57:43;57:44;"from there."
57:44;57:46;"Whoa, yeah, that's funny."
57:46;57:48;"By the way, did you hear Jerry Garcia died?"
57:48;57:49;"What?"
57:49;57:50;"Uh, no."
57:50;57:52;"I was just taking a nap."
57:52;57:53;"Okay."
57:53;57:55;"Anyway, four years later, leave The Matrix."
57:55;57:56;"Yeah."
57:56;58:00;"Lana Wachowski, birth year 1965."
58:00;58:03;"Lily Wachowski, birth year 1967."
58:03;58:07;"The two years bookending in 1966."
58:07;58:08;"The years between."
58:08;58:09;"The year between."
58:09;58:12;"1966 is the year between for the Wachowskis."
58:12;58:14;"[laughs]"
58:14;58:16;"Mac, can you throw in White Rabbit?"
58:16;58:18;"[laughs]"
58:18;58:20;"Underneath the whole conversation."
58:20;58:23;"Dude, one pill makes you smaller."
58:23;58:25;"I mean, yeah, truly."
58:25;58:27;"One pill makes you tall."
58:33;58:35;"It is funny to think about the way"
58:35;58:37;"that all this media flows"
58:37;58:39;"because obviously Alice in Wonderland"
58:39;58:41;"was originally a book from the 19th century"
58:41;58:43;"written by Lewis Carroll,"
58:43;58:45;"who's also a mathematician."
58:45;58:46;"Kind of freaky."
58:46;58:48;"I actually read reading about this song,"
58:48;58:50;"Grace Lix said something like,"
58:50;58:52;"""Yeah, how'd you come up with the song?"""
58:52;58:54;"She's like, ""Did acid, listened to Sketches of Spain"
58:54;58:56;"by Miles Davis and wrote a song"
58:56;58:58;"about Alice in Wonderland."""
59:03;59:05;"I can hear the Sketches of Spain, that drum pattern."
59:05;59:06;"Oh, yeah, totally."
59:06;59:08;"So Sketches of Spain."
59:08;59:10;"The Dead love Sketches of Spain too."
59:10;59:12;"They used to have a jam called Spanish Jam."
59:12;59:14;"Oh, yeah."
59:14;59:16;"Was that in reference to Sketches of Spain?"
59:16;59:17;"Yeah."
59:17;59:19;"They're riffing on..."
59:26;59:27;"I love this song."
59:27;59:29;"It's so freaky."
59:29;59:30;"It's such a good vibe."
59:30;59:32;"I don't know if the CIA wrote this song or what,"
59:32;59:34;"but can you picture a more perfect,"
59:34;59:36;"big hit to drop"
59:36;59:39;"at the peak of summer of love drug culture?"
59:39;59:43;"It's like this mystical, like, doors opening song"
59:43;59:45;"that ends with somebody yelling,"
59:45;59:47;"""Feed your head!"""
59:47;59:48;"[laughs]"
59:48;59:51;"Like, music doesn't meet the moment"
59:51;59:53;"like that very often."
59:58;01:00:00;"♪ Kind of mushroom ♪"
01:00:00;01:00:01;"[laughs]"
01:00:01;01:00:05;"♪ And your mind is moving low ♪"
01:00:05;01:00:09;"♪ Go ask Alice ♪"
01:00:09;01:00:11;"Yeah, this song goes hard, man."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"It keeps building."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"Yeah."
01:00:13;01:00:15;"I mean, honestly, that's why I got so hyped"
01:00:15;01:00:16;"about the new Matrix."
01:00:16;01:00:17;"When I saw the trailer,"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"and they were just kind of jamming this,"
01:00:19;01:00:22;"I was like, ""All right, I gotta watch this."""
01:00:22;01:00:23;"I love when she's like,"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"""When logic and proportion..."""
01:00:25;01:00:26;"Yeah."
01:00:26;01:00:27;"[laughs]"
01:00:27;01:00:32;"♪ And the Red Queen's off her head ♪"
01:00:32;01:00:35;"♪ Remember ♪"

01:00:40;01:00:45;"♪ Feed your head ♪"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"How high did this song get in the charts, Seinfeld?"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"Looks like this peaked at 81"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"on the US Billboard Hot 100."
01:00:52;01:00:53;"Oh."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"1967."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"Oh, it didn't get higher."
01:00:56;01:00:58;"I guess ""Somebody to Love"" maybe was the biggest."
01:00:58;01:00:59;"Oh, wait, wait, wait."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, my bad, my bad."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"It peaked at number eight."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"I'm looking at a year-end chart."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"That's amazing."
01:01:03;01:01:05;"It peaked at number eight in 1967."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"Top ten."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"Yeah, it's very short."
01:01:08;01:01:11;"It also peaked at number one in Canada."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"Okay, Canadian number one."
01:01:12;01:01:13;"Yeah."
01:01:13;01:01:16;"Can you imagine just being a young person"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"in Canada in the late '60s?"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"This song is number one on the charts."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"Wow."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"All right."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"I don't know if I want to go any deeper into..."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"Let's kind of reel back into the simulation."
01:01:26;01:01:30;"Yeah, we got to get into some more pedestrian subjects."
01:01:30;01:01:32;"We're getting way too heady."
01:01:32;01:01:34;"Anyway, we're looking forward to having Thurston and Trey"
01:01:34;01:01:38;"do some pedal talk in the not-so-distant future."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"But wow, that Matrix stuff is freaky."
01:01:40;01:01:41;"[laughs]"
01:01:41;01:01:44;"All right, here's a little bit of ""Zurich is Stained"" by Pavement."
01:01:45;01:01:49;"I can't sing it strongly enough"
01:01:52;01:01:56;"'Cause I can't strip that just don't hurt"
01:01:57;01:01:59;"If you watch the light change"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"Don't hold on then and then"
01:02:04;01:02:08;"You think it's easy, but you're wrong"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"I am not one to develop any problems"
01:02:12;01:02:15;"Zurich is stained and it's not my fault"
01:02:16;01:02:20;"Just hold it back, don't let me crunch up any"
01:02:26;01:02:30;"So what does it mean, a mistake or two?"
01:02:33;01:02:37;"Fix the kind of mistakes no one can trace"
01:02:38;01:02:43;"To the fountain where we sold it and held them hanging"
01:02:45;01:02:49;"You think it's easy, but you're wrong"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"I am not one to develop any problems"
01:02:53;01:02:56;"Zurich is stained and it's not my fault"
01:02:57;01:03:00;"Just hold it back, don't let me crunch up any"
01:03:01;01:03:04;"You think it's easy, but you're wrong"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"I am not one to develop any problems"
01:03:08;01:03:11;"Zurich is stained and it's not my fault"
01:03:12;01:03:15;"Just hold it back, don't let me crunch up any"
01:03:19;01:03:23;"One last thing I just want to say about Connecticut and guitar music"
01:03:23;01:03:26;"is on the text that we were talking about this that"
01:03:26;01:03:30;"probably two of the most famous and influential guitarists"
01:03:30;01:03:33;"from Connecticut are Thurston Moore and John Mayer"
01:03:33;01:03:39;"and I wonder if they, I mean maybe The Grateful Dead is where these guys meet"
01:03:39;01:03:43;"although I still have my doubts that Thurston even is a dead fan at all"
01:03:43;01:03:46;"but I'm curious if they care about each other's music at all"
01:03:46;01:03:49;"I have to share this only because I find it amusing"
01:03:49;01:03:52;"when we were talking about Thurston and John Mayer like hanging out"
01:03:52;01:03:55;"and kind of like getting in the studio and messing around"
01:03:55;01:03:58;"I couldn't help but picture that it was like a big album"
01:03:58;01:04:01;"and a big kind of dad rock album in the late 90s"
01:04:01;01:04:04;"was Eric Clapton and B.B. King linked up"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"for an album called Riding With The King"
01:04:06;01:04:09;"I've never heard it before but I feel like it was very omnipresent"
01:04:09;01:04:12;"My dad definitely had that album"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"Can you recall any of the music?"
01:04:14;01:04:20;"No, but my dad was very into like buying 90s Clapton and B.B. King"
01:04:20;01:04:23;"like Clapton records and buying B.B. King records"
01:04:23;01:04:25;"Okay, he was keeping up with the new stuff"
01:04:25;01:04:26;"CDs, oh yeah yeah"
01:04:26;01:04:29;"That was a big album, I mean it sold millions"
01:04:29;01:04:34;"and the cover is them in like a cool old school convertible"
01:04:34;01:04:38;"and Eric Clapton's driving and B.B. King's in the back with his guitar"
01:04:38;01:04:41;"and they're just like kind of like look at these guys cruising"
01:04:41;01:04:43;"two legends linking up"
01:04:43;01:04:46;"Anyway, I'm proposing a Thurston Moore/John Mayer"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"Riding With The King type album"
01:04:48;01:04:51;"Maybe it's Riding Through Connecticut"
01:04:51;01:04:53;"Riding Through CT"
01:04:53;01:04:55;"Connecticut Cruising, something like that"
01:04:55;01:04:58;"The two of them in a convertible"
01:04:58;01:05:03;"It's possible that those guys don't know each other's music at all"
01:05:03;01:05:04;"That's really funny"
01:05:04;01:05:07;"Do you think Mayer can name five Sonic Youth songs?"
01:05:07;01:05:08;"No"
01:05:08;01:05:12;"This is from Thurston Moore, Avril Lavigne and John Mayer are laying"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"That's it?"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"What is this, an old Time Crisis episode?"
01:05:16;01:05:21;"That's a headline from August 25th, 2007"
01:05:21;01:05:26;"from the UK website Female First"
01:05:26;01:05:30;"Sonic Youth frontman Thurston Moore has hit out at Avril Lavigne and John Mayer"
01:05:30;01:05:33;"insisting 70 year olds rock harder than they do"
01:05:33;01:05:36;"The rocker recently collaborated with Yoko Ono and claims"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"she's edgier than most modern artists"
01:05:38;01:05:42;"He tells Spin Magazine, ""I'm playing with Yoko Ono and she's well past 70 and she rocks"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"Neil Young rocks"""
01:05:44;01:05:46;"It's certainly not John Mayer or Avril Lavigne"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"Those people don't rock"
01:05:48;01:05:54;"Well that answers the question"
01:05:54;01:05:57;"I don't think John Mayer can name five Sonic Youth songs"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"John Mayer hits back"
01:05:59;01:06:02;"""Growing up in Connecticut, I didn't have a lot of guitar heroes I could look up to"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"Thurston Moore, you were one of them"
01:06:04;01:06:08;"However, I'm throwing out all of my Sonic Youth records"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"including my rare Japanese 7"""
01:06:10;01:06:12;"and some of your solo work"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"You've really hurt me"
01:06:14;01:06:17;"Alright, yeah, they don't f*** with each other"
01:06:17;01:06:20;"Thurston, I saw you at Lollapalooza 95 in Hartford"
01:06:20;01:06:23;"The last 35 minutes"
01:06:23;01:06:26;"a wall of noise"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"just feedback and static"
01:06:28;01:06:30;"Changed my life"
01:06:30;01:06:33;"If even in the late 90s Thurston was already kind of like salty"
01:06:33;01:06:38;"that he didn't get a nice piece of the post-jury dead pie"
01:06:38;01:06:43;"Can you imagine if people told him how Dead & Co. is out there crushing it"
01:06:43;01:06:46;"and he's like ""Oh yeah, who they got on guitar? John Mayer?"""
01:06:46;01:06:50;"Thurston in 2019 just like"
01:06:50;01:06:54;"opening up Pitchfork or something"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"What's cooking?"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"The John Mayer announcement is"
01:06:58;01:07:00;"I guess John Mayer started playing with him in like 15, right?"
01:07:00;01:07:02;"When did Mayer start playing with them?"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"Was it the Fare Thee Well era?"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"Well, it was after that, so yeah, I think"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"Something, somewhere in there"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"16, 17, yeah"
01:07:10;01:07:14;"And then word on the street is that Avril Lavigne is going to join as the new Donna"
01:07:14;01:07:16;"Just to really"
01:07:16;01:07:17;"Sick"
01:07:17;01:07:20;"As is often the case on Time Crisis, we've gone very deep on what was probably"
01:07:20;01:07:24;"a handful of throwaway comments from Thurston Moore that he never thought about again"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"25 years ago"
01:07:26;01:07:30;"Yeah, he's well aware of the fact that he works squirreling the tradition of"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"the Yoko Ono's"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"As Jake said earlier, the Tony Conrad's"
01:07:34;01:07:38;"Not the Jerry Garcia's"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"Simple as that"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"Yeah, it's just one of those things"
01:08:04;01:08:06;"I'm sure there's examples from life"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"You know, maybe when you're a kid"
01:08:08;01:08:10;"And an older person"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"Says, oh, there's like another 10 year old here"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"You guys are probably going to have a ball"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"By the time you're 10"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"People are already on their own trips"
01:08:18;01:08:20;"Like, it just doesn't always work"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"And I think there's something about this assumption that's like"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"You d*** around on guitar, you d*** around on guitar too"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"You guys have something in common"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"Like, no man"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"Some people are into basketball, but they don't watch soccer"
01:08:30;01:08:32;"Even though I've heard there's a lot of similarities in the gameplay"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"Are we still talking about the"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"Is it still the Thurston Moore"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"John Mayer album we're talking about?"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"I don't even know what we're talking about anymore, so maybe it's a good reason to move on"
01:08:40;01:08:42;"(Laughter)"
01:08:42;01:08:44;"Okay, speaking of bands and dudes and bands"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"There's some very disturbing news in the U2 world"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"Seinfeld, you want to"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"Break this down for us? What the hell's going on here?"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"Yeah, it seems like"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"U2 frontman"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"Bono is quite down on himself"
01:08:56;01:08:58;"There was a recent interview"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"That he did while promoting a U2 song"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"From the soundtrack"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"From the film Sing 2"
01:09:04;01:09:06;"And the headline here"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"Or the tweet from Consequence"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"Is Bono reveals that he hates the name U2"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"Is ""embarrassed by most of their songs"""
01:09:12;01:09:14;"And only ""recently learned to sing"""
01:09:14;01:09:16;"You know"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"I know the pandemic"
01:09:18;01:09:20;"Has hit us all hard, but it seems like"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"It's hit Bono hardest of all"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"And so yeah, we were just sort of talking about that"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"And I mean"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"Has anybody"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"We don't want to be serving out fake news on TC"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"Has anybody actually listened to the podcast?"
01:09:32;01:09:34;"Is it possible there's more context?"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"Was it a pod or was it a"
01:09:36;01:09:38;"He was on the Award Chatter podcast"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"Yeah, Award Chatter"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"I'm not familiar with that pod"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"Yeah, this is third hand aggregation of the news"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"I didn't personally take the time"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"To listen to Awards Chatter"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"I don't miss an episode usually"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"So it's odd that I missed this one"
01:09:52;01:09:54;"Of all the ones you could have missed"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"It's weird"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"Okay, so we don't, you know, full disclosure"
01:09:58;01:10:00;"We don't know the whole context"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"I could totally picture an interview"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"Where Bono says something like that"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"And then it's fully contextualized by"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"The next time he says ""I'm embarrassed by most of our songs"""
01:10:08;01:10:10;"And then he says like"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"""Yeah, because I'm very easily embarrassed"""
01:10:12;01:10:14;"You know, somebody tells me I'm handsome"
01:10:14;01:10:16;"I say ""Oh, stop"""
01:10:16;01:10:18;"You know, I don't know"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"And then he's like ""Who knows?"""
01:10:20;01:10:22;"It could have been something like that"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"But, I mean, okay, this is the actual quote"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"So, you know, again, lacking context"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"You can only say for sure when you've listened to the full"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"Awards Chatter podcast"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"He said ""I've been in the car"""
01:10:32;01:10:34;"""I've been in the car"""
01:10:34;01:10:36;"How do you do an Irish accent?"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"""I've been in the car when one of our songs"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"Has come on the radio, and I've been the color of"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"As we say in Dublin"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"Scarlet. I'm just so embarrassed"""
01:10:44;01:10:46;"I'm sorry, I'm sorry"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"I'm just so embarrassed"
01:10:48;01:10:50;"""I'm just so embarrassed. The one that I can listen to"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"The most is Miss Sarajevo with Luciano Pavarotti"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"Genuine. Most of the other ones"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"Make me cringe a little bit"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"Most of the other ones"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"U2 literally probably has 300 songs"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"Also, the one with Pavarotti"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"That's the one that would make me cringe"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"Yeah"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"He's having just like a weird midlife"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"Those Pavarotti collabs though"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"There's some good"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"I don't know if you've heard the Mariah Carey one"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"Very powerful"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"Brian Adams"
01:11:18;01:11:20;"Yeah, and I think he linked up with Lou Reed"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"At one of those big concerts"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"""It's such a perfect day"
01:11:24;01:11:26;"I'm glad"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"I spent it with you"""
01:11:28;01:11:30;"Did he really do that?"
01:11:30;01:11:32;"Yeah"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"""Such a perfect day"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"You just"""
01:11:36;01:11:38;"Alright, pause. Can we throw that on Matt?"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"That sounds insane"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"And Pavarotti, Perfect Day"
01:11:42;01:11:44;"It's very powerful"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"And does Pavarotti do like the verses too?"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"He does like an Italian thing, right?"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"Oh, okay. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he doesn't actually sing the part I say"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"I've probably heard it once"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"""Keep me hanging on"""
01:11:54;01:11:56;"""You just keep me hanging on"""
01:11:56;01:11:58;"I can't imagine"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"Picture two"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"More disparate singers"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"""Such a perfect day"""
01:12:04;01:12:06;"That's Lou Reed"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"""Drink Sangria in the park"""
01:12:08;01:12:10;"Imagine if that was Pavarotti"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"""Then drink Sangria in the park"""
01:12:12;01:12:14;"Oh, the James Brown one too"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"I don't know if you've heard that"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"It's a very powerful song"
01:12:20;01:12:22;"It's a James Brown one too"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"I don't know if you've heard that"
01:12:24;01:12:26;"It's a man's world, I think"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"That's great"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"""Just a perfect day"""
01:12:30;01:12:32;"Beautiful song"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"""Feed the animals in the zoo"""
01:12:34;01:12:36;"""Then later a movie too"""
01:12:36;01:12:38;"""And then home"""
01:12:38;01:12:40;"""Oh, Easter"""
01:12:46;01:12:48;"Okay, I was right"
01:12:48;01:12:50;"""And paradise will be with you"""
01:12:52;01:12:54;"""Oh, so joyous"""
01:12:54;01:12:56;"I think it was so nice"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"He had a nice arrangement"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"""You just keep me hanging on"""
01:13:04;01:13:06;"I love the crowd sounds too"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"The eruption with Pavarotti"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"I love the idea that this is a song"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"About two buddies"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"Lou Reed and Luciano Pavarotti"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"Who are just hanging out"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"Going to the zoo"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"And it's like the end of the day"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"And Lou is this kind of depressive"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"You know, artsy New Yorker"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"And he's just saying to his big fun Italian friend"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"""Hey man, I don't normally wear my heart on my sleeve"""
01:13:30;01:13:32;"""But I've been really having a tough time"""
01:13:34;01:13:36;"""And sometimes I feel like a bad person"""
01:13:36;01:13:38;"""But you made me feel good"""
01:13:38;01:13:40;"And then Pavarotti comes in"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"So big"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"Somebody good"
01:13:46;01:13:52;"Oh, it's such a perfect day"
01:13:52;01:13:56;"I've been outstanding with you"
01:13:56;01:14:02;"Oh, such a perfect day"
01:14:02;01:14:06;"You just keep me hanging on"
01:14:10;01:14:14;"Anymore"
01:14:14;01:14:18;"It's funny hearing this Lou Reed song with this like real theatrical performance"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"It could almost be like in a Broadway musical too"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"Yeah"
01:14:22;01:14:26;"I mean, to be fair, it is that more like sweet Broadway side of Lou"
01:14:26;01:14:28;"Yeah"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"You're going to read"
01:14:30;01:14:32;"Just what you saw"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"Is this late Lou?"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"This sounds..."
01:14:36;01:14:38;"No, this is on Transformer"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"Early 70s"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"No, I mean this performance"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"Oh yeah, sorry, sorry"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"Yeah, 90s"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"You're going to"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"You're going to write"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"Read what you saw"
01:14:54;01:14:58;"I love it, what an odd couple"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"Yeah"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"Bono and Pavarotti, it's like"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"You can picture that, it's almost like too close"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"Right"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"Although it did sound like Bono was like legit bummed"
01:15:08;01:15:12;"It almost reminds me of like, remember when Phil Collins had that period"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"Oh yeah"
01:15:14;01:15:16;"Where he was embarrassed by his like"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"Yeah, every interview he did just like"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"Yeah, well my music sucks, my life sucks"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"Everybody makes fun of me"
01:15:22;01:15:34;"Ooh, I'm very happy to think of that song"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"That one's back in rotation now"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"Start playing that around the house"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"Blast it in the car"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"Pavarotti version"
01:15:42;01:15:44;"Yeah"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"To me the narrative of that song, Lou Reed's depressed"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"But has a really nice day to take his mind off of stuff"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"With his big fun Italian friend"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"Luciano"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"And he tries to open up a little bit"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"Doesn't come naturally to him, you know"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"He's kind of a cool guy, but he tries to open up a little bit"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"Just to say, hey man"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"It's actually been really cool"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"Going to the zoo with you"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"And then Luciano, who's always been looking for that opening"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"Just comes in way too hot"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"Oh my god"
01:16:10;01:16:12;"Lou!"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"I consider you my best friend"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"Oh my god, Lou"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"Oh god, I'm so happy you could finally"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"And then after that, Lou's just like"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"Ghosts him for six months"
01:16:22;01:16:24;"He can't handle it"
01:16:24;01:16:26;"I sort of had this sort of like more happier thing"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"Which is like, Luciano calls him and is like"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"You know, like my plane was delayed"
01:16:30;01:16:32;"You know, like I had this layover going back to Italy"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"My plane was delayed"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"You have time to go out and the plane sort of is delayed"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"They go into the zoo"
01:16:38;01:16:40;"You sort of lose track that he said"
01:16:40;01:16:42;"That his plane was delayed"
01:16:42;01:16:44;"You know, the flight is delayed, it's weather"
01:16:44;01:16:46;"Or whatever, and then it's sort of at the end"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"They have this moment, and he opens up to him"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"And that's what Luciano's always wanted from his friend"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"And he's like, my plane was sort of never delayed"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"I never"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"I never bought a return ticket"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"Like I basically have been sort of orchestrated this event to have"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"You know what I mean?"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"Like I just, I wanted this moment with you"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"And you gave it to me"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"I have cancer or something"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"You know what I mean? And then it would end with like I'm done"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"I am"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"And then it's like they have that moment, two older guys"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"Such a perfect day"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"Yeah, that's normally at the end of the movie"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"That's where he'd be like, can I have something to tell you"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"Lou"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"Also, Luciano and Lou"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"They're both named Lou"
01:17:24;01:17:26;"Yeah"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"And he's like, I'm gonna go to him because he's like"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"You're gonna reap what you sow, man"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"You're cringe, dude, I'm out"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"I mean, that's what the Lulu album"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"Should have been, no?"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"Oh, Lou and the two Lus"
01:17:38;01:17:40;"Yeah, right"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"And Metallica just in kind of an advisory capacity"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"I feel like that album has had like a real"
01:17:44;01:17:46;"Advisory"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"Consultation"
01:17:48;01:17:50;"Yeah"
01:17:50;01:17:52;"We'll make that record out sometime on the show"
01:17:52;01:17:54;"Oh yeah, because there's people who ride for it"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"Oh yeah"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"It's interesting that Lou Reed always said that"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"That was one of his best albums"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"And he was like, f*ck the haters, it's one of his best albums"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"Should we do a little bit of that?"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"Or should we stick with the Bono?"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"Let's go back to Bono"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"I do want to listen to Lulu, maybe on the next episode"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"So Bono"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"It's funny that we didn't listen to the song"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"Bono was talking about"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"But also in this interview"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"He said that Robert Palmer"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"Told YouTube bassist Adam Clayton in the 80s"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"God, would you ever tell your singer"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"To just take down the keys a little bit?"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"He'd do himself a favor, his voice a favor"
01:18:28;01:18:30;"And he'd do us all a favor who have to listen to him"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"Damn"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"Why is Bono worrying about what Robert Palmer has to say?"
01:18:34;01:18:36;"I mean, Robert Palmer"
01:18:36;01:18:38;"Has some cool songs, but it's like"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"But he also sings real low"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"Like Robert Palmer's aesthetic"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"Like the good Robert Palmer"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"You might as well face it"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"Not that stuff"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"You know the earlier stuff?"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"What's that song? Johnny and Mary?"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"Yeah"
01:18:54;01:18:56;"*Humming*"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"He's singing like so low"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"And like, kinda like Lou Reed"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"Robert Palmer is classically cool"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"He's kinda like chic"
01:19:06;01:19:08;"Wear like, you know"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"Cool suits, hang out in the Caribbean"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"Sing like this"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"*Humming*"
01:19:14;01:19:16;"He's in the mold of"
01:19:16;01:19:18;"You know, Brian Ferry"
01:19:18;01:19:20;"Yeah, Bono's recalling"
01:19:20;01:19:22;"Some"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"Second hand comment that Adam Clayton"
01:19:24;01:19:26;"Heard from Robert Palmer"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"Like 40 years ago"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"And it's just stuck in his craw, man"
01:19:30;01:19:32;"And it's just coming back to rear its ugly head"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"I can relate a little bit"
01:19:34;01:19:36;"There's been, you know, you don't forget"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"Slates in life"
01:19:38;01:19:40;"The one thing I'll say, especially if you're a sensitive artist"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"I will say though, the older you get"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"The more you find"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"You know, deeper meaning in other things"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"And those things don't matter quite as much"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"Maybe working on Sing 2"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"Got Bono down in the dumps"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"But yeah, I feel you Jake, it has Phil Collins"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"Energy"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"At the end of the day, I do think that Bono"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"You know, we talked about the whole"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"iPod debacle"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"And it was definitely"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"Like the wrong move"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"But there were definitely some people"
01:20:08;01:20:10;"Who were ready to throw out, you know, 30 years"
01:20:10;01:20:12;"Of good heartfelt U2 music"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"Out with the bathwater"
01:20:14;01:20:16;"And Bono is probably hurt"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"By that, and yeah, maybe he's"
01:20:18;01:20:20;"Got some, all those adoring fans"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"When they go on tour and stuff"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"Hasn't stopped his"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"Feelings of embarrassment"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"But then he's also just out here"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"Just not being the best judge of his own work"
01:20:30;01:20:32;"He says he's probably proudest of the song Vertigo"
01:20:32;01:20:34;"That's not a top 5 U2 song"
01:20:34;01:20:36;"Bono? - No"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"No person of taste ranks Vertigo"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"As even a top 10 U2 song"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"U2 has a lot of good songs"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"And also, they're just like"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"Okay, you know what, I think Bono will come back from this"
01:20:46;01:20:48;"And he'll realize"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"As a fan, I would like to see Bono on some like"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"F*** it, I'm a passionate"
01:20:52;01:20:54;"Irish guy"
01:20:54;01:20:56;"What the f*** do you expect? I'm not Brian Ferry"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"I'm not Robert Palmer"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"I'm a passionate man"
01:21:00;01:21:02;"I'm religious, I'm spiritual"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"He's political, he's an activist"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"I'm political"
01:21:06;01:21:08;"I've never gotten one"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"Hint of self-doubt from him"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"He seems like one of the most"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"Confident and sort of"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"Can do and ambitious"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"Guys out there"
01:21:18;01:21:20;"And it's fascinating, he kind of does a little bit of a"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"Crack in the facade, I mean he's only human"
01:21:22;01:21:24;"Yeah, it's lonely at the top"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"What's like a deep U2 song"
01:21:26;01:21:28;"Like you know, obviously there's the classics"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"You know, like Streets Have No Name or One"
01:21:30;01:21:32;"What's like a deeper U2 song"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"That you are like, into?"
01:21:34;01:21:36;"Man, I can't even remember the names of the songs"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"I used to have like a burned CD"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"Of early U2 demos"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"What are they called?"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"That was deep"
01:21:44;01:21:46;"And there's some cool stuff there"
01:21:46;01:21:48;"I mean, yeah, okay, I don't know why"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"Everything that's coming to mind is singles"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"Yeah, I mean that's, well they've been pummeled into our head"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"For the last 40 years, I mean"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"Yeah, U2 Deep Cut"
01:21:56;01:21:58;"Yeah, I don't know how deep"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"It's so cruel from Octogbaby, A Deep Cut"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"That's a good song"
01:22:02;01:22:04;"That's a great one"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"Yeah, non-single, non-single"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"Even though Joshua Tree starts out with all like"
01:22:08;01:22:10;"The big hits, there's some like"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"Cool stuff on side too"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"Oh yeah, like"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"In God's Country, Trip Through Your Wires"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"What is it called?"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"Red Hill Mining Town"
01:22:20;01:22:22;"Yeah, that one's awesome"
01:22:22;01:22:26;"The blood runs thin"
01:22:26;01:22:32;"Oh, see faces frozen still"
01:22:32;01:22:36;"Against the world"
01:22:36;01:22:44;"The seam is split"
01:22:44;01:22:48;"The cold face cracks"
01:22:48;01:22:51;"The lines are long"
01:22:51;01:22:55;"There's no going back"
01:22:55;01:22:59;"Through hands of steel"
01:22:59;01:23:02;"And heart of stone"
01:23:02;01:23:06;"Our limbo day"
01:23:06;01:23:11;"Has come and gone"
01:23:11;01:23:15;"Hey, leave me holding on"
01:23:15;01:23:18;"In Red Hill Town"
01:23:18;01:23:23;"See life's so down, oh"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"One thing I can't help thinking about too"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"In this context, and I have no idea"
01:23:27;01:23:29;"About the dynamics of the band other than"
01:23:29;01:23:31;"They're the very rare type of band where it's like"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"Four childhood friends"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"Staying together for 50 years"
01:23:35;01:23:39;"Those guys have literally known each other for 50 years"
01:23:39;01:23:42;"Maybe more, maybe not quite 50, almost 50"
01:23:42;01:23:44;"But I'm just picturing"
01:23:44;01:23:46;"The drummer, or you know"
01:23:46;01:23:48;"Somebody else in the organization being like"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"Getting some texts from friends being like"
01:23:50;01:23:52;"""Yo, is your boy okay?"""
01:23:52;01:23:53;"They're just like, ""Why?"""
01:23:53;01:23:55;"They're like, ""I don't know, he did this interview where he said"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"Most of your songs suck, and he's embarrassed"""
01:23:57;01:23:59;"To be fair, I know from the quotes I've seen"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"He went out of his way to say"
01:24:01;01:24:04;"""The band sounds great, it's me and my stupid f***ing voice"""
01:24:04;01:24:06;"So he is being hard on himself"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"But you can imagine the other guys being like"
01:24:08;01:24:10;"""Yeah man, but at the end of the day, the song, it's like"
01:24:10;01:24:13;"You can't really subtract your vocal from the song, like you know, just"""
01:24:13;01:24:16;"So you can imagine, you know, your uh"
01:24:16;01:24:18;"Larry Mullen getting a text, ""Is your boy okay?"""
01:24:18;01:24:20;"Just like, ""I don't know"""
01:24:20;01:24:22;"And he's like, ""He did this weird interview"""
01:24:22;01:24:24;"And he's like, ""Why is he doing an interview?"""
01:24:24;01:24:26;"And he's like, ""Oh yeah, he was promoting"""
01:24:26;01:24:28;"You know that song you guys did for Sing To?"
01:24:28;01:24:29;"That children's movie?"
01:24:29;01:24:30;"No"
01:24:30;01:24:32;"He went on the Awards Chatter podcast"
01:24:32;01:24:34;"To promote that song"
01:24:34;01:24:36;"The song from Sing To"
01:24:36;01:24:39;"I guess maybe he's hoping they'll get nominated for an Oscar"
01:24:39;01:24:42;"And while he was promoting the song from Sing To"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"He said that the vast majority of your other songs"
01:24:44;01:24:46;"Suck and embarrass him"
01:24:46;01:24:48;"To be like, ""Oh my god"""
01:24:48;01:24:50;"Actually, throw in the song from Sing To"
01:24:50;01:24:51;"Real quick"
01:24:51;01:24:53;"While you do that"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"He also, obviously the headline was"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"He also hates the name U2"
01:24:57;01:24:58;"Right?"
01:24:58;01:24:59;"It's a great name"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"So what he said was"
01:25:01;01:25:04;"Bono also said that he's not a huge fan of the name U2"
01:25:04;01:25:07;"And that their first manager, Paul McGinnis"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"Got them to keep the name by telling them"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"""It would look good on a t-shirt"""
01:25:11;01:25:12;"""A letter and a number"""
01:25:12;01:25:15;"He added, ""I didn't realize that the Beatles was a bad pun either in our head"""
01:25:15;01:25:17;"""It was like a spy plane, U-boat"""
01:25:17;01:25:19;"""It was futuristic"""
01:25:19;01:25:22;"""It turned out to imply this kind of acquiescence"""
01:25:22;01:25:24;"""No, I don't like the name"""
01:25:24;01:25:26;"""I still don't really like the name"""
01:25:26;01:25:28;"You know, this is just a guy in a moment"
01:25:28;01:25:29;"I was gonna say"
01:25:29;01:25:30;"It sort of reminds me"
01:25:30;01:25:31;"You can be stuck in a moment"
01:25:31;01:25:35;"It sort of reminds me of the Will Smith press tour"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"You know, when he started saying all those things"
01:25:37;01:25:40;"It's like, there's something about the fact that it's the Sing To press tour"
01:25:40;01:25:43;"It's like, maybe he's just not used to this sort of thing or something"
01:25:43;01:25:46;"But it's like, at this moment in time"
01:25:46;01:25:48;"He's had this career he's had"
01:25:48;01:25:51;"And now he's promoting this song and this movie"
01:25:51;01:25:54;"There's like something about the confluence of all these things"
01:25:54;01:25:56;"Maybe he's just like, ""What the hell am I doing?"""
01:25:56;01:25:58;"Exactly, he's having an existential moment"
01:25:58;01:25:59;"It's what it seems like"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"Well yeah, and also he's probably"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"Maybe because he's getting older"
01:26:03;01:26:07;"He cares less about micromanaging the expectations"
01:26:07;01:26:10;"Of everybody who might care or comment about you too"
01:26:10;01:26:12;"And yeah, like you said, he's in a moment"
01:26:12;01:26:14;"If you had a friend or something who was like"
01:26:14;01:26:16;"""Oh man, I've been having a rough week"""
01:26:16;01:26:18;"""Some shit didn't go my way"""
01:26:18;01:26:20;"Sometimes I feel like I honestly"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"I picked the wrong career"
01:26:22;01:26:23;"You ever feel that way?"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"You ever feel like everything you do sucks"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"And you wish you could just go back?"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"People say shit like that all the time"
01:26:29;01:26:30;"And then literally you might check in with them a week later"
01:26:30;01:26:31;"Like, ""Hey, how you doing?"""
01:26:31;01:26:33;"And they'll just be like, ""Oh, I'm f*cking great"""
01:26:33;01:26:36;"""Yeah, oh no, I was on a weird diet last week"""
01:26:36;01:26:37;"Or I don't know"
01:26:37;01:26:40;"Imagine Bono saying in these things"
01:26:40;01:26:41;"Like, how do you feel?"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"Like, ""I don't know, I kind of feel like I picked the wrong career"""
01:26:43;01:26:45;"Bono's had multiple great careers"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"He was managing director of a private equity firm"
01:26:47;01:26:50;"That made a ton of money investing in Facebook"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"Imagine he's just like"
01:26:52;01:26:56;"He's like, ""I should have just gone a whole hog into the hedge fund stuff"""
01:26:57;01:26:59;"""I'm not a good singer"""
01:27:09;01:27:11;"So this is the new U2 song"
01:27:11;01:27:12;"This is the new Pavement song"
01:27:12;01:27:15;"And he's only just learned to sing, he said"
01:27:15;01:27:21;"It's a Monday morning"
01:27:21;01:27:24;"Matt, just let me know that"
01:27:24;01:27:28;"The cast of Sing 2 covers Where the Streets Have No Name"
01:27:28;01:27:32;"There's also a Bono and Scarlett Johansson cover of"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"On the soundtrack"
01:27:36;01:27:41;"I gotta say, Bono has one of the great voices of the last"
01:27:41;01:27:44;"You know, 30, 40 years"
01:27:44;01:27:47;"Now, now that he learned how to sing"
01:27:47;01:27:48;"He's finally learned to sing"
01:27:48;01:27:49;"Yeah, now that he finally learned how to sing"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"They should do like a Taylor Swift"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"And like re-record all of their albums"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"Now that Bono learned to sing"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"And now it's Scooter Braun"
01:27:57;01:27:58;"Under a different name"
01:27:58;01:27:59;"Bono's version"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"Especially since Scooter acquired"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"Yeah, under the name U-Boat"
01:28:03;01:28:05;"U-Boat"
01:28:05;01:28:08;"It's the new version of Joshua Chai"
01:28:08;01:28:11;"When I tell you darling"
01:28:11;01:28:14;"I sing it to survive"
01:28:14;01:28:19;"This really isn't a bad song"
01:28:19;01:28:20;"It's chill"
01:28:20;01:28:23;"It's sort of hard to think of a situation you'd listen to it"
01:28:23;01:28:27;"Yeah, I don't love like the kind of like pop drums, but"
01:28:27;01:28:31;"The man you carry in your heart"
01:28:31;01:28:36;"Is only comfortable when he's in pain"
01:28:36;01:28:41;"Are you a stranger in your own life?"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"You're a stranger in your own life"
01:28:43;01:28:47;"What are you hiding behind those eyes?"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"What are you hiding behind those eyes?"
01:28:49;01:28:52;"Maybe it's this song that got him in his feelings"
01:28:52;01:28:53;"Yeah"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"And he's always wearing those like"
01:28:55;01:28:58;"Bug-eyed sunglasses"
01:28:58;01:29:00;"He's just like, damn, what am I hiding?"
01:29:00;01:29:05;"I don't sing it just so I can get by"
01:29:05;01:29:11;"Won't you hear me when I tell you darling"
01:29:11;01:29:15;"I sing it to survive"
01:29:16;01:29:20;"If your song saved my life"
01:29:20;01:29:26;"It was then the best days of my life"
01:29:26;01:29:29;"I'm broken now"
01:29:29;01:29:32;"And all your love"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"Keeps me alive"
01:29:34;01:29:37;"It keeps me alive"
01:29:37;01:29:39;"I will say this about Bono"
01:29:39;01:29:42;"Is like, obviously the knock on Bono"
01:29:42;01:29:45;"After a certain point became that he was like arrogant"
01:29:45;01:29:48;"Like he had this like messiah complex or something"
01:29:48;01:29:49;"That's what people said"
01:29:49;01:29:50;"I'm not saying it's true, but"
01:29:50;01:29:53;"That became like the go-to criticism"
01:29:53;01:29:55;"But one thing I'll say about Bono"
01:29:55;01:29:56;"That always interested me"
01:29:56;01:29:57;"'Cause I'm always like"
01:29:57;01:30:00;"I'm always interested in people's influences"
01:30:00;01:30:01;"And you know, just like"
01:30:01;01:30:02;"What the f*** you talking about on Time Crisis?"
01:30:02;01:30:05;"Like does John Mayer know five Sonic Youth songs?"
01:30:05;01:30:07;"You know, these are interesting questions"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"And I will say this about Bono"
01:30:09;01:30:11;"And I'm thinking about this as I listen to him sing a song"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"Your song saved my life"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"He's like a big music fan"
01:30:15;01:30:17;"Sometimes you meet people"
01:30:17;01:30:20;"Or you hear about people who are musicians"
01:30:20;01:30:23;"And there's a certain type who like"
01:30:23;01:30:26;"You know for sure if they weren't in a band"
01:30:26;01:30:30;"They'd basically be the modern equivalent of like a record store dude"
01:30:30;01:30:31;"Maybe they'd be a critic"
01:30:31;01:30:35;"Maybe they would just be like your friend who like collects vinyl"
01:30:35;01:30:36;"Like, you know, I don't know"
01:30:36;01:30:38;"There's some of these dudes like Eddie Vedder is like that"
01:30:38;01:30:40;"They're really big fans of music"
01:30:40;01:30:41;"Heads, yeah"
01:30:41;01:30:42;"Yeah, they're heads"
01:30:42;01:30:43;"He's definitely a head"
01:30:43;01:30:45;"And like he's always done interviews"
01:30:45;01:30:48;"Where he was like really wants to remind people that"
01:30:48;01:30:51;"U2 was like inspired by punk"
01:30:51;01:30:53;"And they basically were a punk band in the early days"
01:30:53;01:30:57;"And you know, you'd be doing an interview in like the 2000s"
01:30:57;01:30:59;"And by that point it's like"
01:30:59;01:31:03;"Nobody's like giving you props for like saying you're into punk"
01:31:03;01:31:04;"It's arguably like unfashionable"
01:31:04;01:31:06;"But sometimes he'd do these interviews"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"Where he really seemed enthusiastic to be like"
01:31:08;01:31:09;"We love the Ramones"
01:31:09;01:31:14;"And he would sometimes drop these like kind of lesser known UK punk bands"
01:31:14;01:31:16;"You could just tell like he really like knew his shit"
01:31:16;01:31:17;"He was passionate about it"
01:31:17;01:31:20;"Like it wouldn't totally shock me"
01:31:20;01:31:27;"If like Bono was on eBay buying like first-pressing Wire singles"
01:31:27;01:31:28;"It wouldn't shock me"
01:31:28;01:31:29;"No"
01:31:29;01:31:30;"He has a little bit of that energy"
01:31:30;01:31:31;"Like he's a fan"
01:31:31;01:31:34;"And like I think actually he"
01:31:34;01:31:38;"I read a biography of Lou Reed a year or two ago"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"And I'm pretty sure when Lou Reed died"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"Bono gave like a rousing wake"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"That people said like really brought the house down"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"Wow, he was at the funeral?"
01:31:46;01:31:47;"I think he was at the funeral"
01:31:47;01:31:50;"And he like gave like a really deep heartfelt"
01:31:50;01:31:51;"And you know there's a thing"
01:31:51;01:31:52;"People say like you know Irish people"
01:31:52;01:31:56;"They famously have the most fun funerals"
01:31:56;01:31:58;"Irish wake"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"And like people are like yeah"
01:32:00;01:32:03;"When you die you want a Bono type person"
01:32:03;01:32:07;"Giving like a really warm Irish speech about you"
01:32:07;01:32:08;"So anyway I don't know"
01:32:08;01:32:11;"I have this vision of Bono as being like a big fan or something"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"So I could imagine in his mind"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"He's probably like"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"It wouldn't strike me as crazy"
01:32:17;01:32:22;"That he would compare U2 to some like band that broke up in 1982"
01:32:22;01:32:25;"That like almost nobody gives a f*** about"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"But in his head he's just like"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"As much as he has the side that seems arrogant"
01:32:29;01:32:31;"I'm willing to believe there's like another part of him"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"That's just like"
01:32:33;01:32:37;"U2 will never be as good as Joy Division"
01:32:37;01:32:38;"You know?"
01:32:38;01:32:41;"Like just some s*** that like most people wouldn't even think about"
01:32:41;01:32:44;"Just like what they accomplished in three years"
01:32:44;01:32:47;"We have failed to do in 40"
01:32:47;01:32:48;"Or even somebody like"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"I could probably think of something better than Joy Division"
01:32:50;01:32:51;"That's almost like too"
01:32:51;01:32:52;"Deeper"
01:32:52;01:32:53;"Yeah"
01:32:53;01:32:54;"What's like a really random"
01:32:54;01:32:58;"Like early 80s UK like post-punk band"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"Or not even random but just like you know cool"
01:33:00;01:33:03;"Like not like X-Ray Spex or something"
01:33:03;01:33:06;"We've never made a song half as good"
01:33:06;01:33:08;"As the worst X-Ray Spex song"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"We're pathetic"
01:33:10;01:33:14;"Yeah but it sounds like he has a temporary bout of impostor syndrome"
01:33:14;01:33:15;"Yeah"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"He's like we're posers man"
01:33:17;01:33:20;"And the truth is all the bands that he probably thought were the greatest of all time"
01:33:20;01:33:22;"All broke up in"
01:33:22;01:33:24;"Actually probably all did break up by 1982"
01:33:24;01:33:25;"You know?"
01:33:25;01:33:26;"Oh for sure"
01:33:26;01:33:29;"And then those guys went on to like have like day jobs"
01:33:29;01:33:30;"Right"
01:33:30;01:33:33;"And he's like you know global rock star"
01:33:33;01:33:35;"Slash hedge fund manager"
01:33:35;01:33:37;"Those are two big jobs"
01:33:37;01:33:42;"God I wonder who else spoke at the Lou Reed funeral"
01:33:42;01:33:43;"That's fascinating"
01:33:43;01:33:46;"Like picturing like after Bono like brings the house down"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"Like James Hetfield gets up there like"
01:33:48;01:33:50;"Oh I don't know"
01:33:50;01:33:55;"Well s*** that's a tough act to follow Bono"
01:33:55;01:33:57;"I met Lou kind of late in life"
01:33:58;01:34:03;"I don't have the same way with words as Paul Hewson"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"But what can I say"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"Lou f***ing rocks man"
01:34:07;01:34:10;"Lou f***ing rocks"
01:34:10;01:34:17;"I wonder if Pavarotti was there"
01:34:17;01:34:20;"That must have been a real who's who man"
01:34:20;01:34:23;"Bono, James Hetfield, Pavarotti"
01:34:23;01:34:26;"And Jake met Lou Reed in the last few years of his life"
01:34:26;01:34:27;"I did yeah"
01:34:27;01:34:28;"I told that story on the show"
01:34:28;01:34:31;"And at the time he was working on the Lulu album"
01:34:31;01:34:35;"He was magnanimous in his praise for Metallica"
01:34:35;01:34:36;"Wait I can't"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"Because Jake actually I'm always surprised"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"Sometimes by your opinions like actually"
01:34:40;01:34:41;"We got to remember"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"I still want to revisit Nine Inch Nails"
01:34:43;01:34:44;"Because I always think"
01:34:44;01:34:46;"This is one of the rare times when I think about a TC thing"
01:34:46;01:34:47;"Like a week later"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Just like what the hell is wrong with Jake man"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"No I was like talking about it"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"Like a week later in the studio"
01:34:53;01:34:54;"I was just like"
01:34:54;01:34:56;"You guys know that Jake hates Nine Inch Nails"
01:34:56;01:35:00;"Passionately hates Nine Inch Nails"
01:35:00;01:35:02;"Everybody's like what?"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"Who did you say that to?"
01:35:04;01:35:05;"Ariel?"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"No I think I said that to Ariel"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"He wasn't like shocked or anything"
01:35:09;01:35:10;"He's like well"
01:35:10;01:35:12;"I guess that doesn't surprise me"
01:35:12;01:35:13;"Really?"
01:35:13;01:35:14;"He hates them"
01:35:14;01:35:17;"But Jake you like Metallica right?"
01:35:17;01:35:18;"Oh yeah"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"I'm not a metal guy at all"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"But yeah Metallica rules"
01:35:22;01:35:25;"It's almost like I'm not a huge horror movie fan"
01:35:25;01:35:26;"But like"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"There's a few that kind of transcend the genre"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"Like the Exorcist or something"
01:35:30;01:35:31;"Yeah the Shining"
01:35:31;01:35:32;"And like Metallica is like that"
01:35:32;01:35:34;"And like their name is even just embodies"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"Like the genre"
01:35:36;01:35:37;"Right"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"Especially like you know the earlier stuff"
01:35:39;01:35:40;"Yeah"
01:35:40;01:35:41;"Master of Puppets"
01:35:41;01:35:42;"Master"
01:35:42;01:35:45;"We're about to bang out this top 5"
01:35:45;01:35:49;"It's time for the top 5"
01:35:50;01:35:52;"On iTunes"
01:35:52;01:35:59;"Due to our full listen down of Diamond Sea by Sonic Youth"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"All 20 minutes"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"We're gonna have to keep this top 5 snappy"
01:36:03;01:36:04;"Alright?"
01:36:04;01:36:05;"Love it"
01:36:05;01:36:09;"God I hope the Diamond Sea by Sonic Youth isn't in the top 5"
01:36:09;01:36:12;"Do another full 20 minute listen down"
01:36:12;01:36:14;"I don't know if the heads are gonna make it through that"
01:36:14;01:36:15;"Okay we're gonna do"
01:36:15;01:36:18;"Compare the top 5 songs right now"
01:36:18;01:36:20;"With the top 5 Billboard singles"
01:36:20;01:36:22;"In 1981"
01:36:22;01:36:23;"Why 1981?"
01:36:23;01:36:24;"Anybody?"
01:36:24;01:36:27;"That's the year that Sonic Youth started"
01:36:27;01:36:29;"Wonder if Bono likes Sonic Youth"
01:36:29;01:36:33;"14 before the Diamond Sea first came out"
01:36:33;01:36:34;"And actually I'm looking at it"
01:36:34;01:36:37;"Looks like Diamond Sea there actually is a new remix"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"That's in the top 5 so"
01:36:39;01:36:42;"Get ready dude"
01:36:42;01:36:45;"It's Kygo and Sonic Youth featuring"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"Ariana Grande"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"Diamond Sea remix"
01:36:49;01:36:50;"It's number 1"
01:36:50;01:36:51;"It's actually 40 minutes"
01:36:51;01:36:55;"Time takes it's crazy toll"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"We don't even have a single 20 minute song"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"In our whole catalog"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"It's a f***ing embarrassment man"
01:37:01;01:37:04;"Wait did you ask if Bono likes Sonic Youth?"
01:37:04;01:37:06;"I bet he not"
01:37:06;01:37:09;"I bet Bono would know some of the 80's stuff"
01:37:09;01:37:13;"100% Bono knows the song Teenage Riot"
01:37:13;01:37:14;"For sure"
01:37:14;01:37:17;"I mean Bono yeah if he's one of these record collector guys"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"He definitely has a copy of Daydream Nation"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"That he bought in 1983"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"And he would know the early 90's s***"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"Like 100% and cool thing"
01:37:25;01:37:26;"That kind of stuff"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"He probably knows 100% you're right"
01:37:28;01:37:30;"You never know with Bono"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"I have this quote from Bono"
01:37:32;01:37:33;"He's under his"
01:37:33;01:37:35;"I guess during Octane Baby"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"He had an alter ego called The Fly"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"That I don't remember"
01:37:39;01:37:40;"But he's doing this"
01:37:40;01:37:42;"That's his shades thing"
01:37:42;01:37:43;"The shades yeah"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"The cool 90's guy was The Fly"
01:37:45;01:37:46;"So he says this"
01:37:46;01:37:48;"I'm having to work too fast here"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"But so there's a quote from him"
01:37:50;01:37:51;"By the way"
01:37:51;01:37:52;"So he knows of them"
01:37:52;01:37:53;"So he says"
01:37:53;01:37:56;"By the way I think it's good that Sonic Youth and Nirvana are on Geffen Records"
01:37:56;01:37:58;"I don't think they should be embarrassed by it"
01:37:58;01:38:00;"I think Kurt Cobain is a fine singer"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"I don't"
01:38:02;01:38:04;"It's such an odd"
01:38:04;01:38:05;"So he said"
01:38:05;01:38:09;"Because I don't think any musician should ever be embarrassed"
01:38:09;01:38:10;"Of their singing voice"
01:38:10;01:38:13;"Nor the vast majority of their catalog"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"So I say to Sonic Youth and Nirvana"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"Always be proud"
01:38:17;01:38:19;"Never go on a podcast"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"And admit that you're embarrassed"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"Alright so yeah he's aware of that"
01:38:23;01:38:24;"I'll never do that"
01:38:24;01:38:25;"Chin up boys"
01:38:25;01:38:26;"God alright"
01:38:26;01:38:28;"Maybe we gotta get Bono on the program one day"
01:38:28;01:38:29;"Only"
01:38:29;01:38:30;"We've joked about this before"
01:38:30;01:38:32;"Like getting Noel Gallagher or something"
01:38:32;01:38:33;"And just"
01:38:33;01:38:35;"That could be an alternate version of Time Crisis"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"Just get like Rockstars and the whole thing"
01:38:37;01:38:38;"Is just like"
01:38:38;01:38:39;"Do you like this band?"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"Have you heard their later work?"
01:38:42;01:38:44;"I can kind of picture Bono being like"
01:38:44;01:38:47;"I remember the 80's stuff with Sonic Youth"
01:38:47;01:38:48;"In a way"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"I really became a fan"
01:38:50;01:38:51;"You're gonna laugh"
01:38:51;01:38:52;"But in the later"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"In the 2000's era"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"Sonic Nurse"
01:38:56;01:38:57;"Murray Street"
01:38:57;01:39:01;"In a way I connected with their music more in that phase of my life"
01:39:01;01:39:02;"Okay"
01:39:02;01:39:03;"Number 5 song"
01:39:03;01:39:05;"I have some important context"
01:39:05;01:39:09;"Bono is quoted saying that he fell asleep once"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"On the lighting board"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"At a Sonic Youth concert"
01:39:13;01:39:19;"The full context is he has an allergy to something called"
01:39:19;01:39:21;"Salix Silates"
01:39:21;01:39:24;"I guess that's an ingredient found in aspirin"
01:39:24;01:39:28;"It's part of why he wears those sunglasses all the time"
01:39:28;01:39:29;"What?"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"But yeah he said he has an allergy to this"
01:39:31;01:39:34;"Salix Cyclates"
01:39:34;01:39:38;"Quote that means I lose my voice or I fall asleep in the strangest places"
01:39:38;01:39:41;"Like once on the lighting board for Sonic Youth"
01:39:41;01:39:42;"God"
01:39:42;01:39:44;"Must have been like a weird festival or what?"
01:39:44;01:39:45;"No"
01:39:45;01:39:48;"He goes on to say one of the loudest concerts in the world"
01:39:48;01:39:52;"And I get red eyes which is one of the reasons I wear the sunglasses"
01:39:52;01:39:54;"He just rolled to the Sonic Youth show"
01:39:54;01:39:56;"Yeah he might have just rolled to the Sonic Youth show in Dublin"
01:39:56;01:39:58;"And he's at the lighting board?"
01:39:58;01:40:00;"He's hanging by the lighting board? Okay"
01:40:00;01:40:01;"Alright"
01:40:01;01:40:04;"He probably knows the lighting technician if it's a local guy"
01:40:04;01:40:07;"Anyway he likes Sonic Youth enough to go to their show"
01:40:07;01:40:10;"I think is what we can take from that"
01:40:10;01:40:14;"And the thing that just absolutely kills me"
01:40:14;01:40:18;"Is I fell asleep in the middle of"
01:40:18;01:40:21;"Right in the middle of the Diamond Sea"
01:40:21;01:40:26;"And the idea that anybody may have caught me Bono sleeping"
01:40:26;01:40:30;"In the middle of probably one of my favorite songs of all time"
01:40:30;01:40:35;"And maybe thought it's because I couldn't hang for 20 minutes of drone jamming"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"Couldn't be further from the case man"
01:40:37;01:40:41;"It was a sublime improvisation"
01:40:41;01:40:45;"I like how it says Bono as Liam Neeson basically"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"It's become very Liam Neeson"
01:40:47;01:40:50;"It was a sublime improvisation"
01:40:50;01:40:54;"It was due to an allergic reaction to aspirin"
01:40:54;01:40:57;"Thurston hasn't talked to me in years"
01:40:57;01:41:00;"It's like a Curve episode"
01:41:00;01:41:03;"Where Thurston sees Bono asleep and he's just like"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"Bono's like Larry falls asleep"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"I have an allergy"
01:41:07;01:41:10;"So here's something interesting"
01:41:10;01:41:13;"Yeah you had an allergic reaction happen to be during the Diamond Sea"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"It's one of my favorite songs Thurston"
01:41:15;01:41:16;"No"
01:41:16;01:41:18;"You gotta believe me"
01:41:18;01:41:22;"Okay guys we're getting closer"
01:41:22;01:41:24;"It takes a minute but we're punching our way to the truth"
01:41:24;01:41:29;"The Edge has been telling HotPress.com about the inspiration behind the new U2 album"
01:41:29;01:41:32;"Which is due Summer 2003"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"So actually we should figure out which album this is"
01:41:34;01:41:36;"2023?"
01:41:36;01:41:38;"No 2003 so this is 20 years old"
01:41:38;01:41:40;"Oh this is 20 years ago okay"
01:41:40;01:41:42;"Right now"
01:41:42;01:41:43;"We're going"
01:41:43;01:41:45;"Okay this is either coming out next year"
01:41:45;01:41:46;"It might be 20"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"Oh no it's actually 20 years ago"
01:41:48;01:41:51;"It actually makes no difference"
01:41:51;01:41:53;"The Edge said quote"
01:41:53;01:41:56;"Right now I'm getting very excited about bands playing together in a room"
01:41:56;01:41:58;"And what that sounds like"
01:41:58;01:42:00;"It sounds very fresh to me"
01:42:00;01:42:02;"So the albums I'm excited about are things like Sonic Youth"
01:42:02;01:42:04;"The Sonic Youth record"
01:42:04;01:42:05;"Or Mudhoney"
01:42:05;01:42:06;"Damn"
01:42:06;01:42:07;"Things that are very visceral"
01:42:07;01:42:09;"Mudhoney in '03"
01:42:09;01:42:12;"What was the new Sonic Youth record in around 2003?"
01:42:12;01:42:13;"Let me get a number crunch"
01:42:13;01:42:14;"Great question"
01:42:14;01:42:16;"I don't know if we're getting to the top 5 today folks"
01:42:16;01:42:18;"I think we just did 81"
01:42:18;01:42:20;"I think we pound through 81"
01:42:20;01:42:21;"Okay"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"It doesn't feel good when we don't do a top 5"
01:42:23;01:42:25;"It doesn't feel like the show doesn't end properly"
01:42:25;01:42:26;"You're the soul of this show Jake"
01:42:26;01:42:27;"You're right"
01:42:27;01:42:30;"Oh Sonic Nurse came out in '04"
01:42:30;01:42:32;"Murray Street '02"
01:42:32;01:42:34;"So maybe they did like a live in the room"
01:42:34;01:42:35;"No overdubs kind of thing"
01:42:35;01:42:36;"So I was right"
01:42:36;01:42:37;"U2 is into Murray Street"
01:42:37;01:42:38;"You nailed it dude"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"You're gonna laugh when I say this but"
01:42:40;01:42:44;"My favorite era of Sonic Youth is"
01:42:44;01:42:46;"It's a Murray Street into Sonic Nurse"
01:42:46;01:42:47;"Dude I like"
01:42:47;01:42:48;"I mean"
01:42:48;01:42:51;"Ed's writing for late period Mudhoney"
01:42:51;01:42:56;"Was he really talking about a new Mudhoney record?"
01:42:56;01:42:57;"He might have"
01:42:57;01:42:58;"I don't know"
01:42:58;01:42:59;"See guys"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"At the end of the day everybody's"
01:43:01;01:43:03;"There's always more than meets the eye"
01:43:03;01:43:04;"There are a lot of haters"
01:43:04;01:43:06;"They just love to see a headline like"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"Bono's embarrassed by U2 songs"
01:43:08;01:43:09;"Hardy har har"
01:43:09;01:43:10;"Okay"
01:43:10;01:43:12;"All the haters coming out of the woodworks"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"Very funny"
01:43:14;01:43:16;"Okay yeah you're embarrassed by their songs too"
01:43:16;01:43:17;"You never liked them"
01:43:17;01:43:19;"Hardy har har"
01:43:19;01:43:20;"Well guess what"
01:43:20;01:43:22;"These guys aren't that different from you"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"They're out there listening to Murray Street"
01:43:24;01:43:26;"They're out there just trying to do their best"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"They're fans just like you"
01:43:28;01:43:30;"You don't know them"
01:43:30;01:43:31;"Anyway go see Sing 2"
01:43:31;01:43:32;"Actually I do have to shout out Sing 2"
01:43:32;01:43:35;"Because it's directed by Garth Jennings"
01:43:35;01:43:39;"Who directed a lot of the great early Vampire Weekend videos"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"Like A-Punk"
01:43:41;01:43:42;"And Cousins"
01:43:42;01:43:43;"Good for Garth"
01:43:43;01:43:44;"Yeah"
01:43:44;01:43:46;"Alright number five"
01:43:46;01:43:49;"In this week of 1981"
01:43:49;01:43:51;"Air Supply"
01:43:51;01:43:53;"Every Woman in the World"
01:43:53;01:44:02;"I mean this is like probably our most Gen X episode"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"Sort of front to back"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"Oh yeah very Gen X"
01:44:06;01:44:07;"Right at home"
01:44:08;01:44:10;"I'm a big girl"
01:44:10;01:44:23;"Are there two different singers in Air Supply?"
01:44:23;01:44:24;"Yeah"
01:44:24;01:44:30;"It's a duo"
01:44:30;01:44:31;"Oh"
01:44:31;01:44:32;"Interesting"
01:44:32;01:44:33;"Like on their big song"
01:44:33;01:44:35;"All Out of Love or whatever it is"
01:44:35;01:44:37;"It's like one guy sings the verse"
01:44:37;01:44:39;"One guy sings the chorus"
01:44:39;01:44:48;"It's very strange to me"
01:44:48;01:45:03;"What does that mean?"
01:45:03;01:45:05;"That's a funny sentiment"
01:45:05;01:45:07;"Thank you?"
01:45:07;01:45:13;"You are totally not unique"
01:45:13;01:45:21;"Everything I need"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"I guess he's saying like"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"You encompass all of the"
01:45:36;01:45:38;"Positive qualities"
01:45:38;01:45:41;"That every woman in the world could possibly contain"
01:45:41;01:45:42;"Yeah"
01:45:42;01:45:43;"You contain everything"
01:45:43;01:45:44;"You contain multitudes"
01:45:44;01:45:45;"And I guess"
01:45:45;01:45:46;"Yeah it's like"
01:45:46;01:45:47;"You're everything"
01:45:47;01:45:49;"Maybe he's responding to"
01:45:49;01:45:52;"Somebody being insecure"
01:45:52;01:45:53;"There's so many"
01:45:53;01:45:54;"Beautiful"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"Interesting women out there"
01:45:56;01:45:57;"I'm just one"
01:45:57;01:45:58;"Yeah"
01:45:58;01:46:01;"He said no you're every woman in the world to me"
01:46:02;01:46:05;"You're my fantasy"
01:46:05;01:46:08;"You're my reality"
01:46:08;01:46:13;"Girl you're every woman in the world to me"
01:46:13;01:46:17;"You're everything I need"
01:46:17;01:46:20;"You're everything to me"
01:46:20;01:46:22;"Oh girl"
01:46:22;01:46:23;"Okay"
01:46:23;01:46:24;"Cool"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"Cool"
01:46:26;01:46:29;"The number four song"
01:46:29;01:46:30;"Eddie Rabbit"
01:46:30;01:46:31;"The song"
01:46:31;01:46:32;"I Love a Rainy Night"
01:46:32;01:46:33;"Do you know this one?"
01:46:33;01:46:36;"Yeah and I feel like we heard it back in the day"
01:46:36;01:46:40;"Eddie Rabbit was kind of like a country guy"
01:46:40;01:46:41;"Yeah"
01:46:41;01:46:42;"I love a rainy night"
01:46:42;01:46:44;"I love to hear the thunder"
01:46:44;01:46:45;"Watch the lightning"
01:46:45;01:46:47;"When it lights up the sky"
01:46:47;01:46:51;"You know it makes me feel good"
01:46:51;01:46:55;"Well I love a rainy night"
01:46:55;01:46:57;"It's such a beautiful sight"
01:46:57;01:46:59;"I love to feel the rain on my face"
01:46:59;01:47:02;"Taste the rain on my lips"
01:47:02;01:47:06;"In the moonlight shadows"
01:47:08;01:47:11;"Showers wash all my cares away"
01:47:11;01:47:12;"Cool production"
01:47:12;01:47:15;"I wake up to a sunny day"
01:47:15;01:47:17;"Cause I love a rainy night"
01:47:17;01:47:20;"Yeah I love a rainy night"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"Yeah"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"Well I love a rainy night"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"This is like"
01:47:26;01:47:29;"I picture like if Buddy Holly had lived like"
01:47:29;01:47:32;"This is what his music would have sounded like"
01:47:32;01:47:33;"Oh totally"
01:47:33;01:47:34;"Yeah"
01:47:34;01:47:37;"70s were kind of rough for Buddy Holly"
01:47:37;01:47:41;"But then he did have a top 5 single in 1980 called I Love a Rainy Night"
01:47:41;01:47:44;"Yeah Buddy had some ill conceived kind of"
01:47:44;01:47:47;"Psychedelic records in the early 70s"
01:47:47;01:47:48;"Didn't hit"
01:47:48;01:47:50;"I love to feel the rain on my face"
01:47:50;01:47:52;"Taste the rain on my lips"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"Give the people what they want Buddy"
01:47:54;01:47:56;"In the moonlight shadows"
01:47:56;01:48:03;"What's a song in this heart of mine"
01:48:03;01:48:06;"What's a smile on my face every time"
01:48:06;01:48:08;"Cause I love a rainy night"
01:48:08;01:48:12;"Yeah I love a rainy night"
01:48:12;01:48:15;"Oh I love a rainy night"
01:48:15;01:48:19;"Yeah I love a rainy night"
01:48:19;01:48:22;"I sing this song a lot to myself when it rains at night"
01:48:22;01:48:23;"On a rainy night?"
01:48:23;01:48:27;"Like there was some like sweet rainy nights around Christmas in LA"
01:48:27;01:48:30;"And I definitely would be like walking over to the kitchen"
01:48:30;01:48:31;"Like open the fridge and be like"
01:48:31;01:48:33;"And I love a rainy night"
01:48:33;01:48:35;"[Laughter]"
01:48:35;01:48:37;"Love that"
01:48:37;01:48:40;"Shower wash all my haircare away"
01:48:40;01:48:43;"I wake up to a sunny day"
01:48:43;01:48:45;"Cause I love a rainy night"
01:48:45;01:48:48;"Yeah I love a rainy night"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"I love a rainy night"
01:48:50;01:48:52;"Congratulations to Eddie Rabbit"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"The number 3 song"
01:48:54;01:48:55;"Oh a big one"
01:48:55;01:48:58;"Cool and the Gang with Celebration"
01:49:09;01:49:11;"Hmm this is interesting"
01:49:11;01:49:17;"Cool and the Gang sax player Ronald Bell told Billboard that the song came out of a time of religious study"
01:49:17;01:49:20;"The initial idea came from reading the Quran"
01:49:20;01:49:23;"I was reading the passage where God was creating Adam"
01:49:23;01:49:26;"And the angels were celebrating and singing praises"
01:49:26;01:49:29;"That inspired me to write the basic chords and the line"
01:49:29;01:49:32;"Everyone around the world come on let's celebrate"
01:49:32;01:49:33;"Wow"
01:49:33;01:49:34;"Interesting"
01:49:34;01:49:37;"Quranic origins of celebration"
01:49:37;01:49:40;"That's really funny"
01:49:40;01:49:44;"He's picturing like the garden of Edith and like Adam"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"Celebrate"
01:49:46;01:49:51;"I mean this song still gets people moving at celebrations today"
01:49:51;01:49:53;"He tapped into something"
01:49:53;01:49:55;"Something deep and archetypal"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"It's your pleasure"
01:50:26;01:50:30;"Everyone around the world come on"
01:50:33;01:50:35;"Woohoo"
01:50:35;01:50:38;"It's a celebration"
01:50:41;01:50:42;"Woohoo"
01:50:46;01:50:49;"Celebrate good times"
01:50:49;01:50:51;"I mean this song really feels like a celebration"
01:50:51;01:50:53;"It's a celebration"
01:50:53;01:50:56;"Celebrate good times"
01:50:56;01:50:58;"Come on"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"Let's celebrate"
01:51:00;01:51:04;"There's a party going on right here"
01:51:04;01:51:07;"A dedication to last throughout the years"
01:51:07;01:51:08;"Okay"
01:51:08;01:51:10;"Classic"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"Sounds great"
01:51:12;01:51:18;"Produced by the Brazilian musician Omir Deodato"
01:51:18;01:51:20;"With Cool and the Gang"
01:51:20;01:51:22;"The number two song"
01:51:22;01:51:23;"Oh damn heavy"
01:51:23;01:51:25;"Yeah we've definitely been in this like era before"
01:51:25;01:51:29;"Because the number two song this week January 81"
01:51:29;01:51:31;"Was a John Lennon song"
01:51:31;01:51:33;"Because this was a month"
01:51:33;01:51:36;"You know a month after he was murdered"
01:51:36;01:51:39;"This is from his last album with Yoko Ono"
01:51:39;01:51:40;"Double Fantasy"
01:51:40;01:51:42;"Just like starting over"
01:51:46;01:51:50;"Our life together"
01:51:50;01:51:52;"Is so precious"
01:51:52;01:51:55;"So this became his biggest solo hit in the US"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"Bigger than imagined"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"Crazy"
01:51:59;01:52:02;"We have grown"
01:52:02;01:52:05;"He's kind of getting into his throwback Buddy Holly"
01:52:05;01:52:06;"Rock and roll sh*t on this song"
01:52:06;01:52:08;"For sure"
01:52:08;01:52:10;"You know over Christmas actually"
01:52:10;01:52:13;"I listened to his classic Christmas song"
01:52:13;01:52:15;"You know Happy Christmas War is Over"
01:52:15;01:52:16;"Oh yeah"
01:52:16;01:52:18;"Which I always thought was from 1980"
01:52:18;01:52:19;"Oh no it's from like"
01:52:19;01:52:21;"It's from like 69 or 70"
01:52:21;01:52:22;"Yeah it's from 70"
01:52:22;01:52:24;"I always, it was a huge hit 1980"
01:52:24;01:52:27;"Because he was killed right before Christmas"
01:52:27;01:52:28;"Right"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"He was killed in early December"
01:52:30;01:52:32;"And so it was a huge hit in 80"
01:52:32;01:52:34;"But I was just, I had no idea"
01:52:34;01:52:36;"I always thought it was late period"
01:52:36;01:52:39;"When I see you darling"
01:52:39;01:52:45;"It's like we both are falling in love again"
01:52:45;01:52:50;"It'll be just like starting over"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"Oh oh"
01:52:52;01:52:53;"Starting over"
01:52:53;01:52:56;"So dark and this was like his last hit"
01:52:56;01:52:58;"This like song about like"
01:52:58;01:53:00;"Kind of like optimism"
01:53:00;01:53:02;"Like let's get sh*t back on track"
01:53:02;01:53:05;"You know we've had a weird few years"
01:53:05;01:53:06;"Baby I love you"
01:53:06;01:53:08;"It'll be like starting over"
01:53:08;01:53:09;"We can do this"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"We got a whole another chapter left"
01:53:11;01:53:14;"He's like 12 years in on his relationship"
01:53:14;01:53:15;"With Yoko"
01:53:15;01:53:16;"Yeah"
01:53:16;01:53:18;"There were some rough years in the 70s"
01:53:18;01:53:19;"And it's just like"
01:53:19;01:53:20;"Yeah"
01:53:20;01:53:21;"Let's hit the reset button"
01:53:21;01:53:25;"Yeah he's like super optimistic about the 80s"
01:53:25;01:53:31;"Starting over"
01:53:31;01:53:36;"Why don't we take us alone"
01:53:36;01:53:39;"Take a trip somewhere far away"
01:53:39;01:53:41;"Yeah I feel like he had some hits in the 80s"
01:53:41;01:53:43;"That were gonna happen"
01:53:43;01:53:44;"Yeah"
01:53:44;01:53:46;"You know what I mean"
01:53:46;01:53:51;"Like we used to in the early days"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"He would have been involved with the"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"We are the world thing"
01:53:55;01:53:57;"Yeah and he could have had like a cool like"
01:53:57;01:54:01;"Tasteful 90s acoustic guitar album"
01:54:01;01:54:03;"Yeah Rick Rubin"
01:54:03;01:54:04;"Yeah"
01:54:04;01:54:08;"When I see you darling"
01:54:08;01:54:12;"It's like we both are falling in love again"
01:54:12;01:54:15;"This song has a big"
01:54:15;01:54:17;"Little Shop of Horrors energy"
01:54:17;01:54:18;"This is like exactly what the"
01:54:18;01:54:20;"Little Shop of Horrors soundtrack sounds like"
01:54:20;01:54:23;"I don't know that one"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"You're not a Little Shop of Horrors head?"
01:54:25;01:54:26;"I'm not a head no"
01:54:26;01:54:27;"I don't think I've ever seen it"
01:54:27;01:54:29;"Do you know what the plot is?"
01:54:29;01:54:30;"No"
01:54:30;01:54:32;"Do you know what the horror is"
01:54:32;01:54:33;"In the Little Shop of Horrors?"
01:54:33;01:54:35;"No"
01:54:35;01:54:36;"Really?"
01:54:36;01:54:37;"Is it plants?"
01:54:37;01:54:39;"Yeah yeah"
01:54:39;01:54:41;"Like man eating plants or something?"
01:54:41;01:54:42;"Yeah yeah exactly"
01:54:42;01:54:43;"Okay"
01:54:43;01:54:44;"But it has kind of a"
01:54:44;01:54:47;"Throwback 80s soundtrack"
01:54:47;01:54:49;"Or you know 50s throwback"
01:54:49;01:54:50;"Yeah exactly"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"It's cause it takes place in the 50s"
01:54:52;01:54:53;"But it's kind of like"
01:54:53;01:54:56;"As that generation liked to do"
01:54:56;01:54:59;"Giving it like a darker undertone"
01:54:59;01:55:02;"But yeah so all the songs are like that"
01:55:02;01:55:03;"Like Steve Martin sings"
01:55:03;01:55:05;"He plays the sadistic dentist"
01:55:05;01:55:07;"And he sings this song"
01:55:07;01:55:10;"You'll be a dentist"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"It's like it's all 50s"
01:55:12;01:55:13;"Damn"
01:55:13;01:55:14;"But it's tight"
01:55:14;01:55:15;"One of the better American musicals"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"In my opinion"
01:55:17;01:55:19;"So interestingly"
01:55:19;01:55:22;"That song the John Lennon song was"
01:55:22;01:55:25;"You know a throwback type song"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"John getting back in his early rock and roll sh*t"
01:55:27;01:55:29;"And then the number one song"
01:55:29;01:55:31;"Blondie the Tide is High"
01:55:31;01:55:34;"Was a cover of a"
01:55:34;01:55:37;"Ska/Reggae song from the 60s"
01:55:37;01:55:38;"So it's interesting"
01:55:38;01:55:40;"Got two kind of like throwback songs"
01:55:40;01:55:42;"Plus Rainy Night"
01:55:42;01:55:43;"Also kind of a weird throwback song"
01:55:43;01:55:44;"Oh yeah"
01:55:44;01:55:49;"I love this song"
01:55:49;01:55:50;"Yeah this rules"
01:55:50;01:56:13;"I can be a little vampire in this"
01:56:13;01:56:14;"Big time"
01:56:14;01:56:15;"Whoa"
01:56:15;01:56:18;"This is a quote from Sean Lennon"
01:56:18;01:56:19;"John Lennon's son"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"My father had an old Wurlitzer"
01:56:21;01:56:23;"In the game room of our house on Long Island"
01:56:23;01:56:25;"It was filled with 45s"
01:56:25;01:56:27;"Mostly Elvis and the Everly Brothers"
01:56:27;01:56:29;"The one modern song I remember him listening to"
01:56:29;01:56:31;"Was The Tide is High by Blondie"
01:56:31;01:56:33;"Which he played constantly"
01:56:33;01:56:34;"Wow"
01:56:34;01:56:37;"It's not the things you do"
01:56:37;01:56:41;"That tease and hurt me bad"
01:56:41;01:56:42;"But it's the way you do"
01:56:42;01:56:46;"The things you do to me"
01:56:46;01:56:49;"I'm not the kind of girl"
01:56:49;01:56:53;"Who gives up just like that"
01:56:53;01:56:56;"Oh no"
01:56:56;01:56:59;"It's sort of interesting that none of these songs"
01:56:59;01:57:00;"In '81"
01:57:00;01:57:01;"I don't know if it's turn of the century"
01:57:01;01:57:02;"I don't know what it is"
01:57:02;01:57:03;"Or turn of the decade"
01:57:03;01:57:04;"But like"
01:57:04;01:57:05;"They don't have any"
01:57:05;01:57:07;"They don't have a sound"
01:57:07;01:57:09;"Right they're all"
01:57:09;01:57:11;"There's no unique sound to themselves"
01:57:11;01:57:13;"They're either like a reference to an old sound"
01:57:13;01:57:15;"Or to another thing"
01:57:15;01:57:16;"A few years later"
01:57:16;01:57:18;"Everything would sound just like 80s"
01:57:18;01:57:20;"Synths and"
01:57:20;01:57:21;"Drum sounds"
01:57:21;01:57:23;"There's a lot of nostalgia"
01:57:23;01:57:25;"Or a lot of something else going on"
01:57:25;01:57:27;"But there's no like"
01:57:27;01:57:28;"This is a current sound"
01:57:28;01:57:30;"It's like throwback-y or whatever"
01:57:30;01:57:32;"Can you throw on the original Paragons"
01:57:32;01:57:33;"The Tide is High?"
01:57:33;01:57:35;"I'm not the kind of girl"
01:57:35;01:57:37;"Who gives up just like that"
01:57:37;01:57:39;"Oh no"
01:57:40;01:57:43;"Oh no"
01:57:43;01:57:50;"The tide is high"
01:57:50;01:57:52;"But I'm holding on"
01:57:52;01:57:54;"I love this era of music so much"
01:57:54;01:57:56;"This is my favorite sh*t ever"
01:57:56;01:57:58;"We could definitely go out on this song"
01:57:58;01:58:00;"Oh yeah let's just play this out"
01:58:00;01:58:02;"The original Tide is High by the Paragons"
01:58:02;01:58:04;"We'll be back in two weeks"
01:58:04;01:58:06;"Thank you"
01:58:06;01:58:08;"Peace"
01:58:08;01:58:10;"It's not the things you do"
01:58:10;01:58:13;"That really hurts me bad"
01:58:13;01:58:15;"But it's the way you do"
01:58:15;01:58:18;"The things you do to me"
01:58:18;01:58:21;"I'm not the kind of man"
01:58:21;01:58:25;"Who gives up just like that"
01:58:25;01:58:28;"No"
01:58:28;01:58:30;"The tide is high"
01:58:30;01:58:33;"But I'm holding on"
01:58:33;01:58:38;"I'm gonna be your number one"
01:58:38;01:58:43;"Number one"
01:58:43;01:58:50;"Number one"
01:58:50;01:58:55;"Every man wants you to be his girl"
01:58:55;01:59:00;"But I'll wait my dear 'til it's my turn"
01:59:00;01:59:03;"I'm not the kind of man"
01:59:03;01:59:08;"Who gives up just like that"
01:59:08;01:59:10;"No"
01:59:10;01:59:30;"No"
01:59:30;01:59:35;"Every man wants you to be his girl"
01:59:35;01:59:40;"But I'll wait my dear 'til it's my turn"

01:59:42;01:59:47;"Who gives up just like that"
01:59:47;01:59:49;"No"
01:59:49;01:59:51;"The tide is high"
01:59:51;01:59:54;"But I'm holding on"
01:59:54;01:59:59;"I'm gonna be your number one"
01:59:59;02:00:01;"The tide is high"

02:00:08;02:00:10;"Time Crisis"
02:00:10;02:00:12;"With Ezra Koenig"
