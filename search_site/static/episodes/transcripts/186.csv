01:16;01:19;"- Time Crisis, back again."
01:19;01:23;"Well, it's been an eventful two weeks."
01:23;01:24;"Jake, how you doing?"
01:24;01:27;"- I'm pretty much back to normal,"
01:27;01:29;"but it's been a real rollercoaster."
01:29;01:31;"Had COVID."
01:31;01:33;"First time I've tested positive."
01:33;01:35;"- Finally got COVID."
01:35;01:36;"How strange."
01:36;01:37;"- Yeah, right?"
01:37;01:41;"I've been living like it's 2019 for a long time."
01:41;01:45;"I don't know, yeah, I got COVID."
01:45;01:47;"I think I maybe got it at the Cheesecake Factory"
01:47;01:50;"or during a screening of the film Tar,"
01:50;01:53;"which we talked about on the last show."
01:53;01:55;"I went to, I ate nachos with my brother"
01:55;01:57;"at the Cheesecake Factory in Glendale,"
01:57;01:59;"and then we went and saw Tar."
01:59;02:01;"So I guess when we recorded last,"
02:01;02:04;"I probably contracted it."
02:04;02:05;"- You were incubating."
02:05;02:08;"- About to show symptoms the next day."
02:08;02:10;"And then we had a big Mountain Brews record release show"
02:10;02:13;"booked for Friday, November 4th."
02:13;02:15;"And we practiced the weekend before,"
02:15;02:18;"and I had like a little scratch on my throat before practice."
02:18;02:20;"And I was like, ""Oh, I probably have a cold."""
02:20;02:21;"You know, especially with having a kid,"
02:21;02:24;"like I always have like some sort of like"
02:24;02:27;"low grade congestion, I feel like."
02:27;02:29;"And so I was like, ""Oh, you know,"
02:29;02:30;"""I didn't really think much of it."""
02:30;02:31;"And then like at the end of practice,"
02:31;02:34;"I was like, ""Oh man, I'm sick."""
02:34;02:37;"And then like felt like crap at home that night,"
02:37;02:40;"tested the next morning, sure enough, COVID."
02:40;02:42;"And there were seven people in Mountain Brews"
02:42;02:46;"and five of them ended up with COVID, thanks to me."
02:46;02:47;"- Damn."
02:47;02:50;"- I know, it was really a super spreader event."
02:50;02:52;"And so yeah, it canceled the show."
02:52;02:53;"You know, the show was good."
02:53;02:55;"Yeah, we were like all still kind of sick"
02:55;02:56;"by the time the show rolled around"
02:56;02:59;"and there was just no way we were gonna do it."
02:59;03:00;"- So much to unpack there."
03:00;03:01;"Let's start at the top."
03:01;03:04;"So Cheesecake Factory."
03:04;03:05;"- Yeah."
03:05;03:08;"- What's the decision-making process in hitting Cheesecake?"
03:08;03:10;"- Well, if we were partying like it was 2019,"
03:10;03:12;"we would have gone to the Arclight"
03:12;03:15;"in Pasadena or Hollywood."
03:15;03:18;"But the Arclight is no longer."
03:18;03:19;"- It's closed."
03:19;03:21;"- It's a casualty of the COVID era."
03:21;03:23;"So now if you wanna see like a cool,"
03:23;03:25;"arty, tasteful movie like ""Tar,"""
03:25;03:29;"you're gonna end up at the Glendale Americana."
03:29;03:30;"Which is still showing a lot of like-"
03:30;03:31;"- Which is a huge-"
03:31;03:33;"- Yeah, it's still showing the MCU and all that,"
03:33;03:35;"you know, ""Top Gun."""
03:35;03:36;"- And for people who don't know,"
03:36;03:41;"the Glendale Americana is like a huge outdoor mall complex."
03:41;03:42;"- Yeah, it was-"
03:42;03:44;"- With living arrangements."
03:44;03:45;"- With living arrangements."
03:45;03:48;"Oh yeah, Nick, I saw a movie with Nick there once."
03:48;03:53;"It's very LA in the sense that most of the country"
03:53;03:58;"doesn't have these like year-round outdoor places."
03:58;03:59;"You have your kind of like classic,"
03:59;04:03;"like East Coast, Midwestern, just like brutal mall,"
04:03;04:06;"just like concrete spaceship that you like pull up to."
04:06;04:08;"Everything's happening inside."
04:08;04:11;"But I don't know how many places have these."
04:11;04:14;"It's, yeah, a mixed-use development"
04:14;04:19;"that's kind of modeled after a European city."
04:19;04:21;"- Yeah, kind of Vegas-y or like Disneyland-y."
04:21;04:25;"It's actually developed by Rick Caruso, who is-"
04:25;04:26;"- Potentially the mayor."
04:26;04:28;"- Yeah, he's in a, I guess they're counting the votes."
04:28;04:29;"- In a dead heat."
04:29;04:32;"- Yeah, but yeah, it's kind of what you're saying."
04:32;04:36;"There's fountains, there's sidewalks."
04:36;04:37;"- Sidewalks, there's a fence happening."
04:37;04:39;"- There's like a little mini train track"
04:39;04:41;"that the kids can ride on."
04:41;04:42;"- Yeah, and then there's apartment buildings."
04:42;04:45;"And when you come, you see all these like memes"
04:45;04:47;"and stuff these days where people talk about"
04:47;04:50;"how sad they are that America doesn't have"
04:50;04:53;"high-density walkable cities."
04:53;04:54;"(laughing)"
04:54;04:55;"- I've never been to the Americana."
04:55;04:58;"- There's memes where kind of,"
04:58;05:01;"I guess people who are into like urbanism,"
05:01;05:04;"they'll point out how people have such fond memories."
05:04;05:05;"I remember a specific meme"
05:05;05:07;"where they were listing all these things"
05:07;05:10;"that a typical kind of like middle-class American"
05:10;05:13;"might say, these are such special moments in my life."
05:13;05:17;"And they'll talk about, wow, I really liked college."
05:17;05:21;"It was great, I was in a building with all my friends,"
05:21;05:26;"walk out the door, go to our communal dining hall,"
05:26;05:28;"walk elsewhere to do everything I had to do,"
05:28;05:31;"spend time together in the quad or whatever."
05:31;05:32;"That's like a fond memory"
05:32;05:36;"that a lot of college-educated Americans have."
05:36;05:38;"And the meme was like, yeah,"
05:38;05:41;"'cause you were in a dense walkable environment."
05:41;05:42;"And then the other examples they give"
05:42;05:44;"that people have fond memories of in America,"
05:44;05:45;"like, you know what I love?"
05:45;05:47;"I love going to Disneyland with my family."
05:47;05:49;"We go as often as we can."
05:49;05:50;"There's people who go twice a year,"
05:50;05:52;"but there's plenty of people who like,"
05:52;05:53;"if they have a vacation time, they go there."
05:53;05:55;"And then the meme is saying, yeah, again,"
05:55;05:58;"it's you're in a dense walkable environment."
05:58;06:00;"You're at your hotel, pop downstairs,"
06:00;06:02;"walk across the street, no cars,"
06:02;06:05;"hit the restaurant, hit the cafe,"
06:05;06:08;"or maybe they went to Europe on vacation once."
06:08;06:10;"Like, man, it was so charming"
06:10;06:13;"being in this little city in Italy."
06:13;06:15;"And basically they're saying over and over again,"
06:15;06:20;"what you're looking for is a dense walkable environment."
06:20;06:25;"And people famously say LA is like the antithesis of that,"
06:25;06:27;"but they gotta go to the Americana"
06:27;06:29;"because that's where,"
06:29;06:31;"if you lived in one of the apartments there,"
06:31;06:33;"you would come downstairs"
06:33;06:35;"and you would be on this funny little street"
06:35;06:39;"where you could go sit at a restaurant."
06:39;06:41;"You'd walk right across the street, no cars."
06:41;06:43;"It's maybe a little bit eerie."
06:43;06:45;"It's definitely a Truman Show vibe,"
06:45;06:48;"but beggars can't be choosers."
06:48;06:53;"Your soul chose to be incarnated in 21st century America,"
06:53;06:57;"not 19th century Italy, so that's on you."
06:57;07:00;"If it's a little weird, it is what it is,"
07:00;07:02;"but you walk downstairs and here you are."
07:02;07:04;"Your kids can ride a funny little train."
07:04;07:05;"You can go sit by the fountain"
07:05;07:08;"and you can walk right over to see a movie, for instance."
07:08;07:10;"- Or you could pop by the Cheesecake Factory"
07:10;07:12;"for a quick brew."
07:12;07:14;"You know, that's your local watering hole."
07:14;07:15;"- Right, exactly."
07:15;07:17;"If you're too much of an aesthete,"
07:17;07:18;"it might not measure up."
07:18;07:21;"You're not having a cool old Italian bar"
07:21;07:22;"where everybody's hanging out,"
07:22;07:27;"but it's, you know, Cheesecake Factory, extensive menu."
07:27;07:30;"And you post up, have your beer, meet up with some friends."

08:28;08:32;"live in the apartments who have like,"
08:32;08:36;"a standing like 5.30 PM beer at Cheesecake."
08:36;08:38;"- For sure."
08:38;08:38;"I thought you were gonna say-"
08:38;08:39;"- That's gonna be us."
08:39;08:40;"(laughing)"
08:40;08:41;"- I thought you were gonna say,"
08:41;08:43;"have like a standing tab, like,"
08:43;08:44;"""Hey, put it on my tab."""
08:44;08:46;"- Oh, is it like a really good relationship with the-"
08:46;08:49;"- Yeah, with the management of the Cheesecake Factory."
08:49;08:52;"- Oh yeah, you know I'm good for it, of course."
08:52;08:55;"- I'm wondering, I'm trying to find if there's anyone"
08:55;08:58;"who's, not that they've never left the Americana,"
08:58;09:01;"but has, you know, done some kind of experiment."
09:01;09:04;"Like, I spent a full year living in the Americana"
09:04;09:07;"and I never left its walls."
09:07;09:09;"- Oh, like Super Seismic for the Americana?"
09:09;09:11;"- Yeah, where it's like, they live there,"
09:11;09:13;"then they go eat there, have a beer"
09:13;09:15;"at the Cheesecake Factory."
09:15;09:17;"I assume there's no-"
09:17;09:20;"- There's other restaurants, there's a non-Chain Italian."
09:20;09:22;"- There's an Italian place I've eaten at."
09:22;09:23;"- I've eaten there too."
09:23;09:24;"It's pretty good."
09:24;09:28;"- It's a non-Chain, or maybe it's covertly a Chain."
09:28;09:29;"- Right."
09:29;09:30;"- So yeah, that's the backstory."
09:30;09:33;"I mean, it was basically like, let's go see ""Tar."""
09:33;09:35;"It's playing in Glendale."
09:35;09:39;"Let's like grab a brew and eat some nachos"
09:39;09:41;"at the Cheesecake Factory, which is just catty corner."
09:41;09:43;"- There are no better options than cheesecake?"
09:43;09:46;"Or you guys kind of liked to hit cheesecake?"
09:46;09:48;"- This is the first time I've done this with my brother."
09:48;09:51;"I've been to that cheesecake a couple of times"
09:51;09:52;"before a movie."
09:52;09:56;"Just 'cause it's, I'm not gonna like park twice."
09:56;09:58;"Like, it's either like the Cheesecake Factory"
09:58;10:00;"or that Italian place."
10:00;10:02;"Maybe there's one other place, I forget."
10:02;10:04;"But it's like, you know, classic,"
10:04;10:09;"like semi-ironic Cheesecake Factory outing."
10:09;10:10;"- Right."
10:10;10:11;"- And plus I was working on a painting"
10:11;10:13;"of a Cheesecake Factory at the time."
10:13;10:14;"- Oh, perfect."
10:14;10:18;"- So I liked the spiritual symmetry of that."
10:18;10:21;"Just for the purposes of my own personal mythology"
10:21;10:24;"and narrative, it's fitting that I would get COVID"
10:24;10:26;"at the Cheesecake Factory."
10:26;10:29;"- And especially as you're working on the painting."
10:29;10:30;"- It was Cheesecake's revenge."
10:30;10:35;"- Cheesecake's revenge on Jake's immune system."
10:35;10:36;"And now you always remember it"
10:36;10:40;"because I hope obviously that COVID"
10:40;10:42;"becomes less of a talking point in the years to come"
10:42;10:44;"because it will just be less of a thing."
10:44;10:46;"But there'll be conversations for the rest of our lives"
10:46;10:48;"where people say, ""Remember COVID?"
10:48;10:49;"""Did you get it?"
10:49;10:51;"""Where'd you get it?"""
10:51;10:54;"And Jake will, ""Mine's not that interesting."
10:54;10:56;"""Yeah, I just got it at home."
10:56;10:58;"""My son got it for whatever."""
10:58;10:59;"You know, like, ""Just got it."""
10:59;11:01;"Whereas Jake's is gonna be--"
11:01;11:02;"- The stuff of legend."
11:02;11:04;"- I got it at Cheesecake Factory"
11:04;11:06;"while I was working on a Cheesecake Factory painting"
11:06;11:10;"before I went to see the film ""Tar."""
11:10;11:11;"And they'll say, ""Whoa, really?"""
11:11;11:15;"And say, ""And by the way, did you know that Todd Field,"
11:15;11:19;"""the director of 'Tar,' may have invented Big League Chew?"""
11:19;11:21;"It's gonna be the perfect dinner party conversation"
11:21;11:25;"for Jake in his 70s living at the Americana."
11:25;11:25;"- I dropped--"
11:25;11:27;"- I got it in this very Cheesecake Factory"
11:27;11:29;"where I have dinner every night."
11:29;11:31;"- Someone, literally someone says, ""Oh yeah, I once got,"
11:31;11:33;"""you ever get COVID?"""
11:33;11:38;"Two hours later, Jake's telling them about Todd Field."
11:38;11:40;"- Yeah."
11:40;11:44;"I did drop the Todd Field co-created Big League Chew"
11:44;11:47;"factoid in a text thread last night."
11:47;11:52;"And it always elicits incredible surprise from people."
11:52;11:54;"The whole text thread was just like, ""Wait, what?"""
11:54;11:57;"- I put out a few Hollywood feelers, by the way."
11:57;11:58;"- On Todd Field?"
11:58;12:00;"- I haven't figured anything out, I'll put it that way."
12:00;12:02;"But I thought of a few people I knew"
12:02;12:04;"who might know people who knew him."
12:04;12:05;"- Yeah."
12:05;12:06;"- And I was just like hitting people up like,"
12:06;12:11;"""Can you ask this person, do you mind reaching out?"""
12:11;12:13;"(laughing)"
12:13;12:14;"Just a friend of a friend,"
12:14;12:18;"""Do you mind reaching out to Tarantino?"""
12:18;12:20;"Are they buddies, kind of similar?"
12:20;12:24;"But I found one guy who might know him and he said,"
12:24;12:26;"""I don't know the answer to that story,"
12:26;12:28;"""but if I reconnect with him at any point"
12:28;12:31;"""in the next few months, I'll feel it out."""
12:31;12:33;"But I did a little more research on that too."
12:33;12:36;"And the one thing I can say without repeating"
12:36;12:39;"our whole live bombshell investigation we did last time"
12:39;12:44;"is that whatever his name was, Nelson, the pitcher,"
12:44;12:45;"- Yeah. - who started it,"
12:45;12:48;"all I can say for sure is having read a little more deeply"
12:48;12:51;"is that his story has changed a bit."
12:51;12:54;"At various points, he's kind of said that Todd Field"
12:54;12:57;"was holding a bag of chopped up licorice"
12:57;12:58;"and that gave him the idea."
12:58;13:00;"And in other interviews, he said,"
13:00;13:04;"""Oh yeah, Todd Field, he was our bat boy, sweet kid."
13:04;13:07;"""I didn't have a kitchen, so actually I made the first batch"
13:07;13:11;"""at his mom's house, but I'd had the idea"
13:11;13:15;"""to do chopped up chewing gum since I was a kid."""
13:15;13:16;"So it's totally different stories."
13:16;13:17;"- Psychotic."
13:17;13:19;"- One day we'll get to the bottom of it,"
13:19;13:21;"but I'm increasingly feeling like Todd Field"
13:21;13:23;"is not a secret billionaire."
13:23;13:25;"So go out and see the film ""Tar"" by the way,"
13:25;13:28;"because the guy does not have big league chew money."
13:28;13:30;"Anybody who's staying home saying,"
13:30;13:34;"""I'll torrent the film 'Tar', I won't see it in theaters."
13:34;13:37;"""Todd Field, he's got that big league chew money."
13:37;13:39;"""He doesn't need my money at the box office."""
13:39;13:41;"I don't think it's true."
13:41;13:44;"And I'm sorry if I gave that impression two weeks ago."
13:44;13:45;"If you're interested in the film"
13:45;13:49;"and you wanna support Todd Field, get your butt in a seat."

14:00;14:03;"I don't think this man is a secret billionaire."
14:03;14:07;"So any kind of antipathy you have towards the mega rich,"
14:07;14:10;"do not project that onto Todd Field."

14:58;15:00;"You know, I could have got it at ""Tar""."

15:45;15:48;"that Hannah actually knows a little bit, who's from Texas."
15:48;15:50;"Anyway, they put out this record."
15:50;15:52;"Okay, no, I have heard of that, yeah."
15:52;15:53;"It's real like kind of like trio."
15:53;15:56;"Remember that record with Dolly Parton and Emmylou"
15:56;15:59;"and Linda Ronstadt in the '80s called ""Trio""?"
15:59;16:00;"Yeah."
16:00;16:02;"It's like they wrote a bunch of really great songs"
16:02;16:03;"and they performed them"
16:03;16:07;"in this very straightforward, sonorous way."
16:07;16:09;"And actually, they had this guy, Eric Slick,"
16:09;16:11;"playing drums for them,"
16:11;16:15;"who actually played drums in the last ""Mountain Brews"" EP,"

17:26;17:28;"none of these people got COVID."
17:28;17:30;"- Correct, I was the only one."
17:30;17:33;"- Okay, well, I mean, I'm sorry for you,"
17:33;17:35;"but that feels like kind of good news"
17:35;17:37;"that didn't spread like wildfire,"
17:37;17:40;"except at bruise practice, maybe 'cause you were singing."
17:40;17:42;"Maybe because you guys were sharing one mic"
17:42;17:44;"singing four-part harmonies."
17:44;17:49;"- No, but we were in a closed room for four hours singing."
17:49;17:51;"Somehow I didn't give it to Hannah, which is amazing,"
17:51;17:53;"but yeah, you're probably right."
17:53;17:56;"Probably the singing, and I was probably right at like,"
17:56;17:59;"I was probably peaking in my contagion right at that,"
17:59;18:01;"like that day, you know?"
18:01;18:06;"But we are playing Friday, November 18th"
18:06;18:10;"as part of a ""Jokerman"" podcast live event at Gold Diggers."
18:10;18:12;"So- - Well, that'll be great."
18:12;18:15;"- That's kind of turned into our record release."
18:15;18:16;"- Oh, perfect."
18:16;18:17;"- Yeah, we're gonna play at like seven,"
18:17;18:20;"and then ""Jokerman"" are gonna hit the stage."
18:20;18:23;"I think I'm gonna be joining them for some of it"
18:23;18:25;"about a discussion, or there'll be a discussion"
18:25;18:29;"about Bob Dylan's new book, ""The Philosophy of Modern Song."""
18:29;18:31;"- Right, maybe we should talk about the book a little bit."
18:31;18:32;"- Yeah."
18:32;18:35;"- I only read the first few songs, but-"
18:35;18:36;"- Yeah."
18:36;18:36;"- Have you finished it, Jake?"
18:36;18:38;"- No, I'm like, I don't know,"
18:38;18:39;"maybe a third of the way through."
18:39;18:41;"- Well, so for anybody who doesn't know,"
18:41;18:43;"Bob Dylan just released this book,"
18:43;18:45;"""The Philosophy of Modern Song."""
18:45;18:47;"Just to put it in context,"
18:47;18:49;"if you don't follow Dylan closely,"
18:49;18:52;"he does get up to some weird, random, extracurricular stuff,"
18:52;18:55;"but it's not like he's releasing books all the time."
18:55;18:56;"Off the top of my head,"
18:56;18:59;"I'm aware of three books he's ever released."
18:59;19:04;"In the '60s, he wrote this kind of like surreal,"
19:04;19:08;"difficult to read, poetic novel called ""Tarantula,"""
19:08;19:11;"which seems a little bit like just at the peak,"
19:11;19:14;"famous '60s Dylan, he got a book contract,"
19:14;19:16;"and then he was like, ""Ah, (beep) I gotta write something."""
19:16;19:20;"Kind of like a post-Kerouac weirdo thing."
19:20;19:25;"But then outside of that, he wrote ""Chronicles"" volume one,"
19:25;19:30;"which was a very interesting impressionistic memoir volume."
19:30;19:35;"And that was already like 20 years ago."
19:35;19:36;"It kind of seemed like he was setting it up"
19:36;19:38;"that, ""Oh man, every few years,"
19:38;19:41;"are we gonna get a new part of Bob Dylan's memoirs?"""
19:41;19:43;"'Cause that first part really jumped around."
19:43;19:45;"It was a bit of early life,"
19:45;19:49;"then a bit of the making of ""Oh Mercy"" in the late '80s."
19:49;19:50;"And then that's been it."
19:50;19:53;"So it is pretty eventful for a Dylan fan"
19:53;19:55;"that he's written a new book."
19:55;19:57;"And it just so happens that this one"
19:57;20:02;"is a bit of music journalism, criticism, I guess you'd say."
20:02;20:04;"He chose how many songs?"
20:04;20:06;"- I think 66."
20:06;20:08;"- 66 songs."
20:08;20:13;"And he basically wrote a mini essay about each one"
20:13;20:15;"where he kind of explains"
20:15;20:17;"what he thinks is going on in the song."
20:17;20:19;"He kind of has his own poetic,"
20:19;20:22;"impressionistic language about it."
20:22;20:24;"Talks a bit about the songwriter,"
20:24;20:27;"but it's pretty like stream of consciousness."
20:27;20:28;"It's not like it opens where it's like,"
20:28;20:29;"""Hey guys, Bob Dylan here."
20:29;20:32;"I've dedicated my life to song craft."
20:32;20:36;"And I wanna take you through a journey of modern music."""
20:36;20:39;"And by doing it, I chose 66 songs that I think"
20:39;20:42;"really tell a story about America,"
20:42;20:44;"about art, and about my inspiration."
20:44;20:45;"It's not like that at all."
20:45;20:48;"It's like you just kind of drop in and it's just like."
20:48;20:50;"- Yeah, I mean, you could read it completely out of order."
20:50;20:52;"You could just jump around in the book,"
20:52;20:55;"just read chapters, you know, willy nilly."
20:55;20:58;"And actually, but as we're saying in the intro of the book,"
20:58;21:00;"he does make a dedication."
21:00;21:01;"This is very TC."
21:01;21:04;"He dedicates the book to all the crew at Duncan."
21:04;21:05;"- Yes."
21:05;21:07;"- Is that the Westlake Village Duncan?"
21:07;21:08;"I don't think there's a Duncan in Malibu."
21:08;21:11;"He's thanking all these people,"
21:11;21:12;"seemingly people he works with."
21:12;21:14;"Oh, who knows who these other people are?"
21:14;21:18;"Eddie Gorodetsky, Sal and Jeremy, the Hot Rod Kings."
21:18;21:19;"(laughs)"
21:19;21:22;"And all the crew at Duncan Donuts,"
21:22;21:24;"P.K. Ferguson and Jonathan Karp."
21:24;21:26;"Yeah, all the crew at Duncan Donuts."
21:26;21:26;"I mean."
21:26;21:28;"- Well, he's a road dog, you know."
21:28;21:30;"- Yeah, he probably means all the hardworking people"
21:30;21:33;"at Duncan Donuts across this great nation."
21:33;21:34;"- Yeah."
21:34;21:35;"- He just jumps right in."
21:35;21:36;"- Yeah."
21:36;21:38;"- Chapter one, Detroit City, Bobby Bear."
21:38;21:39;"In this song, you're the prodigal son."
21:39;21:41;"You went to sleep last night in Detroit City."
21:41;21:42;"- Yeah."
21:42;21:43;"- You're in."
21:43;21:44;"- You know, it's crazy."
21:44;21:46;"Bobby Bear Jr. is the rhythm guitarist"
21:46;21:49;"in the current lineup of Guided By Voices."
21:49;21:50;"- Really?"
21:50;21:50;"- Yeah."
21:50;21:53;"Bobby Bear Jr. is probably like 55."
21:53;21:54;"- That's deep."
21:54;21:55;"I remember when-"
21:55;21:57;"- But there's a picture of Bobby Bear Sr."
21:57;22:00;"with presumably his wife and his kids."
22:00;22:02;"And that's like the kid in the photo"
22:02;22:04;"right in the first chapter of this book"
22:04;22:07;"is definitely, definitely looks like Bobby Bear Jr."
22:07;22:08;"Like in the 60s or 70s."
22:08;22:11;"- That'd be amazing if at the end of his little chapter"
22:11;22:13;"about the Bobby Bear song,"
22:13;22:17;"Dylan is so weird, you never know what he's up on"
22:17;22:19;"or if he like, ended up being like,"
22:19;22:22;"by the way, Bobby Bear's kid playing rhythm guitar"
22:22;22:26;"with an outfit out of Ohio, Guided By Voices."
22:26;22:27;"- Another Bob."
22:27;22:27;"- Also, he's checking out."
22:27;22:28;"(laughing)"
22:28;22:29;"- Another Bob."

23:32;23:35;"I recently found a website where you could listen"
23:35;23:39;"to an archive of Bob Dylan's radio show."
23:39;23:40;"- Oh, cool."
23:40;23:43;"- Because just like us, Bob Dylan, he's not a podcaster,"
23:43;23:47;"but he's also passionate about radio, just like the TC crew."
23:47;23:51;"And for at least a few years, he did a show,"
23:51;23:54;"I think it was for Sirius, called Theme Time Radio."
23:54;23:57;"And I would hear about it, I never actually heard it,"
23:57;24:00;"and I had no idea what it was really like,"
24:00;24:01;"you know, for all I knew it was just Bob"
24:01;24:03;"just picked a bunch of songs"
24:03;24:05;"and kind of like created a playlist or something."
24:05;24:06;"- Yeah."
24:06;24:07;"- That would have made sense."
24:07;24:09;"But then I actually listened to an episode."
24:09;24:10;"- There's a lot of talking."
24:10;24:11;"- There's a lot of talking,"
24:11;24:15;"and he really is enjoying being a DJ,"
24:15;24:18;"and not particularly playing the character of Bob Dylan,"
24:18;24:19;"but really just like being a DJ,"
24:19;24:21;"and this like kind of funny tone,"
24:21;24:24;"like the one I was listening to was, he was like,"
24:24;24:27;"""Well, everybody, perhaps you can't travel at the moment,"
24:27;24:29;"maybe you're working a job,"
24:29;24:31;"but I'm gonna take you all around the world"
24:31;24:33;"today on Theme Time Radio."
24:33;24:35;"The first stop, Switzerland."""
24:35;24:38;"And then he like played some song,"
24:38;24:42;"and he was like, ""Buckle your seat belts and get your ticket,"
24:42;24:45;"'cause now we're heading to the land of China."""
24:45;24:48;"This song written in 1932, it's just like that kind of vibe."
24:48;24:49;"- China."
24:49;24:52;"- The man is passionate about songs"
24:52;24:53;"and sharing it with the world."
24:53;24:55;"So yeah, after hearing the radio show,"
24:55;24:57;"it makes total sense that he would wanna write"
24:57;25:00;"just a book of criticism,"
25:00;25:03;"but it's not like he's giving you like clues,"
25:03;25:05;"like Bob Dylan's guide to songwriting,"
25:05;25:07;"""Here's what I love and how it affected me."""
25:07;25:11;"He puts very little energy, at least what I've seen,"
25:11;25:15;"into trying to like link it back to his own life or work."
25:15;25:17;"This is just him as a listener."
25:17;25:19;"- He's having fun, he's telling stories."
25:19;25:22;"I mean, there's great little anecdotes"
25:22;25:24;"about some of these characters"
25:24;25:26;"or people who are adjacent to them."
25:26;25:28;"There was that great story,"
25:28;25:29;"I don't know if you got to the part"
25:29;25:31;"about the guy who invented the nudie suit."
25:31;25:35;"It was like a refugee,"
25:35;25:39;"like a Jewish refugee from like Central Europe somewhere"
25:39;25:44;"who moved to New York and was designing clothes and stuff,"
25:44;25:46;"wardrobes for Broadway, and then he moved to Hollywood,"
25:46;25:49;"and he started making these like very garish,"
25:49;25:53;"sequined outfits that eventually people like Elvis"
25:53;25:55;"and stuff would wear, but a lot of those..."
25:55;25:58;"And then his name was, I don't have it in front of me,"
25:58;26:01;"but anyway, some sort of similar to Nudie,"
26:01;26:03;"and anyway, like his name was,"
26:03;26:06;"or like the name nudie suit is derivative of his name."
26:06;26:09;"- Of his name, ah, I always wondered where nudie came from."
26:09;26:10;"- What's that?"
26:10;26:12;"- Nudie Cohen, or Nudie Cohn."
26:12;26:13;"- Okay."
26:13;26:17;"And there's this whole thing about how Grant Parsons"
26:17;26:19;"had approached him and was like,"
26:19;26:22;"""Wouldn't it be crazy if you put like marijuana leaves"
26:22;26:24;"on a nudie suit?"""
26:24;26:26;"Bob Dylan has such a way with,"
26:26;26:27;"it's not like a dig at Grant Parsons,"
26:27;26:28;"but he was sort of like, he's like,"
26:28;26:30;"""Well, you know, Grant Parsons,"
26:30;26:31;"he thought he was from the generation"
26:31;26:33;"that invented drug use."""
26:33;26:36;"So he thought he would scandalize Nudie"
26:36;26:39;"with asking him to put weed leaves on the suit."
26:39;26:40;"But Nudie, of course, is just a pragmatist."
26:40;26:42;"He was just like, ""Yeah, sure, what's the big deal?"
26:42;26:43;"I'll do that."""
26:43;26:45;"'Cause like, you know, then on the cover"
26:45;26:48;"of that Flying Burrito Brothers record,"
26:48;26:51;"Grant Parsons is wearing this amazing nudie suit"
26:51;26:53;"with the marijuana leaves all over it."
26:53;26:54;"- Ah, right."
26:54;26:56;"- But you know, that's just like two or three paragraphs"
26:56;26:57;"in this book, and then he's moving on."
26:57;27:00;"I mean, there's tons of like really interesting,"
27:00;27:03;"fun asides."
27:03;27:06;"I was reading, well, there's two songs in here"
27:06;27:08;"from Bobby Darin."
27:08;27:11;"Do you have much of a relationship with Bobby Darin, Ezra?"
27:11;27:13;"- As a matter of fact, I do."
27:13;27:17;"I don't know if I've talked about it on the show much,"
27:17;27:21;"but there's this period, I think I was on vacation."
27:21;27:23;"I must've mentioned this once or twice."
27:23;27:25;"I was on vacation a few years back"
27:25;27:26;"with a fun group of people,"
27:26;27:27;"including some friends of the show,"
27:27;27:31;"like Despot, Ariel Rekshide."
27:31;27:34;"At some point, I think it was Ariel,"
27:34;27:36;"he just started talking about the song ""Splish Splash,"""
27:36;27:38;"and he said, I don't know if he was doing this"
27:38;27:42;"as like a kind of like fun fact type thing,"
27:42;27:44;"but he was kind of like, ""Hey, everybody, real quick,"
27:44;27:44;"off the top of your head,"
27:44;27:47;"what are the opening lines of 'Splish Splash'?"""
27:47;27:48;"- I kind of remember this."
27:48;27:50;"- Everybody was like, ""Do you kind of remember this?"""
27:50;27:52;"- Maybe I talked about it on the show."
27:52;27:56;"Enough time has passed that we can bring it back."
27:56;27:57;"But so everybody was thinking like,"
27:57;27:59;"""Well, yeah, 'Splish Splash,' I was taking a bath"
27:59;28:02;"since on a Saturday night."""
28:02;28:05;"And then you start really trying to get into that line."
28:05;28:07;"You couldn't quite remember."
28:07;28:09;"""Splish Splash, I was taking a bath"
28:09;28:11;"once upon a Saturday night."
28:11;28:12;"Splish Splash, I was taking a bath,"
28:12;28:13;"must've been a Saturday."""
28:13;28:15;"You try to start thinking about"
28:15;28:17;"what would actually make sense in that line."
28:17;28:20;"And then he said, ""No, no, it's 'Splish Splash,'"
28:20;28:24;"I was taking a bath all about a Saturday night."""
28:24;28:25;"I actually, it's a sign for,"
28:25;28:27;"you fact check me as I say this,"
28:27;28:28;"'cause even now- - It's ""long about,"""
28:28;28:30;"""long about a Saturday night."""
28:30;28:32;"- Oh, ""long about a Saturday night."""
28:32;28:34;"""Splish Splash, I was taking a bath"
28:34;28:36;"long about a Saturday night."""
28:36;28:39;"So then it became this whole conversation about it,"
28:39;28:43;"because I guess that's just like a totally archaic phrase."
28:43;28:46;"It must've been common in the '50s and early '60s,"
28:46;28:50;"but the ""long about,"" I guess means just like,"
28:50;28:52;"that's when it happened."
28:52;28:53;"- ""Long about"" definition,"
28:53;28:56;"approximately at the time or date of,"
28:56;28:57;"and the example here is,"
28:57;29:00;"""Long about my third cup of coffee,"
29:00;29:02;"I started to feel too jittery to sit at my desk."""
29:02;29:04;"(laughing)"
29:04;29:06;"- It was approximately Saturday night"
29:06;29:07;"when I was taking a bath."
29:07;29:08;"- Did you hear back yet?"
29:08;29:11;"Well, I texted him long about 9 a.m.,"
29:11;29:14;"so maybe we'll get an answer by this afternoon."
29:14;29:15;"- Yeah, you should start using that"
29:15;29:18;"and see if people are like, ""What did you say?"""
29:18;29:21;"- Yeah, just pure linguistic gaslighting."
29:21;29:23;"Somebody's like, ""I've never heard that phrase."
29:23;29:24;"That sounds really weird."""
29:24;29:26;"I'd be like, ""What the (beep) are you talking about?"
29:26;29:28;"Throw on 'Splish Splash' by Bobby Darin right now."
29:28;29:30;"Are you crazy?"
29:30;29:31;"Throw on the famous, iconic song,"
29:31;29:33;"'Splish Splash' by Bobby Darin."
29:33;29:34;"It's the opening lines,"
29:34;29:36;"and you're telling me you don't know this phrase?"
29:36;29:37;"No, you're weird."
29:37;29:40;"It's weird that you don't say ""long about."""
29:40;29:42;"It's a very common phrase."
29:42;29:43;"It's widely used."
29:43;29:45;"But anyway, something about that,"
29:45;29:46;"""Long about"" a Saturday night,"
29:46;29:49;"then we started talking about Bobby Darin a lot,"
29:49;29:51;"and then we watched the infamous film,"
29:51;29:54;"""Beyond the Sea,"" starring Kevin Spacey."
29:54;29:57;"- What is that like, that movie?"
29:57;29:58;"- You would love it."
29:58;29:58;"It's insane."
29:58;30:00;"- I gotta watch it. - Famously,"
30:00;30:03;"there's parts of it that are normal enough."
30:03;30:05;"It's kind of a good overview of Bobby Darin's life,"
30:05;30:06;"but just no matter what,"
30:06;30:09;"there's always gonna be this eerie quality to it"
30:09;30:11;"because famously, Kevin Spacey"
30:11;30:15;"insisted on playing Bobby Darin throughout his whole life."
30:15;30:17;"And Kevin Spacey at the time,"
30:17;30:19;"you know, he just looked however old he was."
30:19;30:21;"He really looked like a middle-aged guy."
30:21;30:23;"He looked about 50."
30:23;30:26;"So he's playing Bobby Darin as this young, teeny bopper."
30:26;30:28;"It's just like, you just don't buy it."
30:28;30:29;"It doesn't make any sense."
30:29;30:33;"- He's playing 19-year-old Bobby Darin."
30:33;30:33;"- Yeah."
30:33;30:37;"- Bobby Darin died when he was 37, it should be noted."
30:37;30:38;"- Whoa, yeah, yeah."
30:38;30:40;"I think he was literally already older"
30:40;30:41;"than Bobby Darin had been when he died."
30:41;30:43;"So it's very strange."
30:43;30:44;"And there are these like really kind of like"
30:44;30:48;"cheesy musical moments where he's dancing and stuff."
30:48;30:49;"But anyway, I still learned a lot"
30:49;30:51;"about Bobby Darin's life that way,"
30:51;30:52;"and it stayed with me."
30:52;30:54;"So yeah, I do."
30:54;30:56;"I've thought about Bobby Darin quite a bit."
30:56;30:58;"And he did have a really interesting career"
30:58;31:00;"because my understanding is that"
31:00;31:04;"he was a tri-state area Italian guy."
31:04;31:06;"I don't know exactly where he was from."
31:06;31:09;"- Born in Harlem, but I'm not really sure where he grew up."
31:09;31:10;"- Oh, born in Harlem."
31:10;31:11;"Interesting."
31:11;31:12;"- Yeah."
31:12;31:14;"- And my understanding was that he was a guy"
31:14;31:16;"who just wanted to be the next Sinatra."
31:16;31:17;"- Yeah."
31:17;31:20;"- And he wanted to be like a classic"
31:20;31:22;"Italian-American crooner."
31:22;31:24;"And he eventually got there,"
31:24;31:26;"but first, as you often see,"
31:26;31:28;"he had to find just some way to break in"
31:28;31:30;"to the music industry."
31:30;31:33;"And so he made this kind of novelty hit, ""Splish Splash,"""
31:33;31:35;"but that wasn't the real Bobby."
31:35;31:39;"The real Bobby was more in his rendition of ""Mac the Knife."""
31:39;31:41;"So I feel like she tracked me on this."
31:41;31:43;"""Splish Splash"" was before ""Mac the Knife."""
31:43;31:45;"Maybe we should be listening to some of these."
31:45;31:47;"- I made a mini Bobby Darin,"
31:47;31:49;"well, like a two or three song Bobby Darin playlist"
31:49;31:50;"I want us to go on."
31:50;31:52;"- Can we kick it off with ""Splish Splash"" first?"
31:52;31:53;"- Yeah."
31:53;31:55;"Well, I thought ""Bobby Darin"" was so interesting."
31:55;31:59;"Like, I want to just read really quickly from the Bob book."
31:59;32:00;"'Cause the thing that,"
32:00;32:03;"I have a memory of knowing ""Mac the Knife"" when I was a kid"
32:03;32:04;"and knowing ""Splish Splash"""
32:04;32:06;"and not realizing it was the same guy."
32:06;32:09;"But then he also had a hit later of the Tim Harden song,"
32:09;32:11;"""If I Was a Carpenter."""
32:11;32:12;"- He became kind of a hippie."
32:12;32:13;"- He became,"
32:13;32:15;"and I want to really dive into that in a little bit,"
32:15;32:18;"but we'll work our way up to that."
32:18;32:21;"But his sound is so all over the place."
32:21;32:23;"And so Bob's writing about that and he goes,"
32:23;32:27;"""Bobby Darin could sound like anyone or sing any style."
32:27;32:30;"""He was more flexible than anyone of his time."
32:30;32:31;"""He could be Harry Belafonte."
32:31;32:32;"""He could be Elvis."
32:32;32:33;"""He could be Dion."
32:33;32:35;"""He could be a Calypso singer."
32:35;32:38;"""He could be a bluegrass singer or a folk singer."
32:38;32:40;"""He was a rhythm and blues singer."
32:40;32:42;"""The guy was everybody, if anybody."
32:42;32:44;"""But here's the thing about chameleons."
32:44;32:46;"""If you don't watch them changing colors,"
32:46;32:48;"""then they just look like an ordinary lizard."
32:48;32:51;"""Their uniqueness lies in their transformative nature."
32:51;32:52;"""So more fairly,"
32:52;32:54;"""Bobby Darin was more than a chameleon."
32:54;32:57;"""For each of his guises he inhabited with verve and gusto"
32:57;33:01;"""and even in repose, he just about vibrated with talent."""
33:01;33:02;"So he sort of,"
33:02;33:04;"it's classic this book where he's sort of like"
33:04;33:08;"a little bit of a dig, but also very complimentary."
33:08;33:09;"But I love that line about like,"
33:09;33:11;"the thing about chameleons is like,"
33:11;33:13;"if you don't see them changing,"
33:13;33:17;"they might kind of appear sort of ordinary or banal."
33:17;33:18;"- That's awesome too, because it's just,"
33:18;33:21;"that's just great music writing."
33:21;33:22;"- Yes."
33:22;33:22;"- Like that's the same thing."
33:22;33:24;"Like if you were just reading, you know,"
33:24;33:26;"some random like pitchfork review,"
33:26;33:27;"I don't know if they were like writing about"
33:27;33:29;"like a new Bruno Mars album."
33:29;33:30;"- Yeah."
33:30;33:30;"- And you saw that line,"
33:30;33:32;"I 100% would like double check who wrote it"
33:32;33:35;"and be like, okay, you're a great writer."
33:35;33:37;"- Yeah, we're talking chameleons."
33:37;33:39;"- Those are those moments that jump out"
33:39;33:42;"in the best music writing where you're kind of like,"
33:42;33:44;"yeah, that's like a cool way to put it."
33:44;33:47;"- Yeah, the prose in this book is very electric."
33:47;33:49;"- Yeah, Splish Splash was first"
33:49;33:52;"and then Mack the Knife came out a year later."
33:52;33:55;"- Exactly the opposite of what I would have guessed"
33:55;33:56;"if I hadn't seen the film."
33:56;33:57;"- Right."
33:57;34:00;"- Kevin Spacey does kind of look like Bobby Darin."
34:00;34:02;"- It's not that he doesn't look like him,"
34:02;34:04;"he just was the wrong age."
34:04;34:06;"Although Bobby Darin, I guess, apparently,"
34:06;34:08;"I think they talk about in the movie,"
34:08;34:10;"he went bald at a very young age,"
34:10;34:11;"so he was always wearing a wig."
34:11;34:15;"So maybe Kevin Spacey felt like I might be pushing 50,"
34:15;34:18;"but I think I can inhabit the mindset"
34:18;34:22;"of a balding 20 year old."
34:22;34:23;"- This is like-- - Fair enough."
34:23;34:26;"- Did you remember that movie, Dear Evan Hansen?"
34:26;34:27;"- Heard of it."
34:27;34:31;"- That was widely criticized for the Ben Platt"
34:31;34:33;"seeming much older than the teenage character."
34:33;34:35;"- Well, yeah, 'cause with certain actors,"
34:35;34:39;"it's not even just that they're older than the role,"
34:39;34:41;"'cause that's a tale as old as time."
34:41;34:44;"And maybe that's the sad part is the guy's probably like,"
34:44;34:49;"""I'm 29, but the cast of 90210, they were old as hell too."""
34:49;34:51;"And it's like, well, it's not just that."
34:51;34:53;"You just got an old face, man."
34:53;34:55;"You got old face."
34:55;34:57;"- Irishman's groundbreaking technology"
34:57;34:59;"wasn't available at the time."

35:02;35:05;"- Seinfeld, up in Canada,"
35:05;35:07;"is Bobby Darin part of the culture?"
35:07;35:09;"Did you grow up knowing Splish Splash?"
35:09;35:12;"- I mean, yeah, I don't, you know, Splish Splash,"
35:12;35:13;"especially when you're a kid,"
35:13;35:17;"I think it's like a popular song for young people."
35:17;35:19;"It's not like it was playing on the radio all the time"
35:19;35:21;"or anything like that."
35:21;35:22;"- Why is that?"
35:22;35:25;"Why is this song that was a kind of cutting edge rock song"
35:25;35:27;"for cool teenagers in the 50s,"
35:27;35:31;"why is it so associated with early childhood now?"
35:31;35:32;"Why do you think that is?"
35:32;35:33;"- Oh man, Jake?"

35:58;35:59;"This also begs the question."
35:59;36:03;"We'd have to find a, this is a sociological angle."
36:03;36:08;"In the late 50s, were baths infantilized in the same way?"
36:08;36:10;"- I think it was more common."
36:10;36:13;"- Right, it was more common that a grown man"

46:47;46:51;"and that German songwriting team from that era,"
46:51;46:52;"very interesting,"
46:52;46:55;"but it takes a certain type of visionary"

48:58;49:00;"and Three Penny Opera here."
49:00;49:04;"Porgy and Bess takes place on Catfish Row,"

49:11;49:13;"only on a much more sinister level."
49:13;49:15;"A world of small-time petty criminals,"
49:15;49:18;"sneak thieves, gangster pimps, pickpockets,"
49:18;49:22;"the subculture society that Hitlerism put an end to."
49:22;49:24;"One of the songs is of course ""Mack the Knife."""

49:28;49:31;"with the teenage hit 'Splish Splash,'"
49:31;49:32;"a monkey of a song,"
49:32;49:36;"where his finger-popping and crooning style"
49:36;49:39;"was put to good use in the rock and roll domain."
49:39;49:40;"Were there similarities between him and Frank?"
49:40;49:42;"Maybe."
49:42;49:43;"You would have to think so,"
49:43;49:45;"but Darin was headed for a dead end"
49:45;49:47;"and Frank would go on and on and on."""
49:47;49:48;"Yeah."
49:48;49:49;"Harsh, man."

50:19;50:21;"Let's get into some '60s, Darin."
50:21;50:23;"So what was the next song you picked, Jake?"
50:23;50:26;"Well, so he had a hit in 1966"
50:26;50:29;"with this Tim Harden song called ""If I Was a Carpenter."""
50:29;50:32;"I couldn't find it on Apple, which is fine."
50:32;50:35;"I found a really great live version he did in 1971."
50:35;50:39;"And Tim Harden actually is the guy that wrote"
50:39;50:41;"""Reason to Believe"" that Rod Stewart covered."
50:41;50:42;"Oh yeah, right."
50:42;50:44;"Great songwriter."
50:44;50:47;"So this is just like the most like"

50:48;50:50;"kind of transformation."

51:08;51:09;"This one."
51:09;51:22;"[singing in German]"
51:22;51:25;"I remember like listening to the old East Station growing up"
51:25;51:27;"and like I'd hear Mack the Knife sometimes."
51:27;51:30;"And then sometimes I'd hear his 1966 version"
51:30;51:32;"of ""If I Was a Carpenter"""
51:32;51:36;"and being like having that weird chameleon experience"
51:36;51:37;"of like, this is the same dude?"
51:37;51:38;"Right."
51:38;51:44;"[singing in German]"
51:44;51:48;"Splish Splash, Mack the Knife, and this could not be,"
51:48;51:50;"the vocal style could not be more different."
51:50;51:52;"It just reminds me of that like sort of like"
51:52;51:55;"Wonder Years, like Mad Men style thing."
51:55;51:57;"Like the 1960s, right?"
51:57;51:58;"Yeah."
51:58;52:01;"[singing in German]"
52:01;52:05;"Bobby Darin is 100% on the Mad Men journey."
52:05;52:06;"For sure."
52:06;52:07;"Which you'll see in ""Beyond the Sea."""
52:07;52:11;"But yeah, just like a dude in his 30s"
52:11;52:13;"and kind of like in the peak hippie moment"
52:13;52:15;"trying to figure it all out."
52:15;52:19;"Yeah, I mean, it's interesting that Frank Sinatra never,"
52:19;52:21;"he never dabbled in that."
52:21;52:22;"He was a little bit too old."
52:22;52:24;"So he probably thought the hippies were bums."
52:24;52:30;"[singing in German]"
52:30;52:32;"Somebody explained to me this story that"
52:32;52:35;"there's a period where Lee Hazlewood"
52:35;52:38;"was dating his daughter, Nancy Sinatra."
52:38;52:40;"You know, they made all these records together."
52:40;52:42;"I think Lee Hazlewood maybe even wrote a book about it."
52:42;52:45;"Just like he was this kind of like long hair,"
52:45;52:47;"hippie dude dating his daughter."
52:47;52:49;"And he met Frank."
52:49;52:51;"I'm sure Frank was just like,"
52:51;52:52;"this is this clown."
52:52;52:53;"Scumbag."
52:53;52:54;"Get out of here."
52:54;52:55;"Scumbag."
52:55;52:58;"Well, I was digging around a little bit"
52:58;53:01;"and I saw that Bobby Darin played a week of shows"
53:01;53:05;"at the Troubadour in May of 1969."
53:05;53:09;"And I just went straight to like picturing"
53:09;53:12;"like Rick Dalton and Cliff going to the,"
53:12;53:13;"being like,"
53:13;53:14;"- Right, once upon a time in Hollywood."
53:14;53:17;"- You know who's playing at the Trouble Week?"
53:17;53:18;"Remember Bobby Darin?"
53:18;53:21;"He's doing like, and then they go"
53:21;53:24;"and he's playing all these like protest songs."
53:24;53:28;"And like, yeah, Rick is just like pissed."
53:28;53:29;"- What happened to you, man?"
53:29;53:33;"I'd love to get the set lists from that week at the Troub."
53:33;53:34;"There are some live recordings."
53:34;53:37;"I found what,"
53:37;53:38;"there's a live recording from that,"
53:38;53:41;"from the Troubadour set in May of '69."
53:41;53:44;"And he does a monologue in the beginning"
53:44;53:46;"about him like self-releasing his own albums."
53:46;53:48;"I don't know, it's pretty interesting."
53:48;53:53;"- There's an album on a label called Direction Records,"
53:53;53:55;"which no one's ever heard of."
53:55;53:58;"Only because it's my own label."
53:58;54:02;"And the reason I started it was kind of interesting"
54:02;54:03;"maybe to some people."
54:03;54:06;"When my contract was up with the last company"
54:06;54:06;"that I was with,"
54:06;54:09;"I should have said latest, no, last."
54:09;54:13;"I decided that I was gonna try something,"
54:13;54:15;"you know, I wanted to say something else,"
54:15;54:17;"things other than the things that I was doing before."
54:17;54:19;"So other labels came to me and they said,"
54:19;54:20;"we'd like to sign you."
54:20;54:21;"And I was very flattered by that."
54:21;54:22;"And I explained to them what I wanted to do."
54:22;54:24;"And they said, oh yes, that's marvelous."
54:24;54:26;"You wanna do some of those protest songs, very good."
54:26;54:28;"(audience laughing)"
54:28;54:30;"All right, well, we have a special protest department."
54:30;54:33;"(audience laughing)"
54:33;54:35;"Yes, we have a whole A&R staff"
54:35;54:37;"for just devoted to protest things."
54:37;54:39;"(audience laughing)"
54:39;54:41;"Yeah, so they didn't understand what I wanted to do."
54:41;54:42;"So I went to another label."
54:42;54:45;"And by the time I got to the other label"
54:45;54:46;"for the appointment, like a week later,"
54:46;54:49;"two or three of the guys from the label I just left"
54:49;54:51;"had already moved over to the next label."
54:51;54:52;"(audience laughing)"
54:52;54:54;"In the protest department, you know."
54:54;54:57;"Okay, so anyhow, I said, no, it has nothing to do with that."
54:57;54:58;"I just would like to say some things."
54:58;54:59;"I said, well, yeah, you'll do one or two of those"
54:59;55:01;"in an album, you know, but you're gonna give 'em"
55:01;55:02;"a lot of that Mac the Knife stuff, aren't ya?"
55:02;55:03;"Uh-huh."
55:03;55:06;"(audience laughing)"
55:06;55:08;"So I said, no, I already did that."
55:08;55:12;"And that's a nice treat, and I love it."
55:12;55:13;"And I don't put it down."
55:13;55:15;"It was delicious to walk through all those years."
55:15;55:17;"But it's, you know, some other things have happened for me."
55:17;55:19;"And I would just like to, in the meantime,"
55:19;55:21;"I had to start my own label."
55:21;55:22;"(audience laughing)"
55:22;55:23;"So that's what I did."
55:23;55:26;"And the first album was called Bobby Darin,"
55:26;55:30;"Born Walden Robert Casado, which is my real name."
55:30;55:32;"I mean, the opposite wouldn't be true."
55:32;55:36;"I mean, imagine being born Bobby Darin"
55:36;55:38;"and calling yourself Walden Robert Casado."
55:38;55:39;"(audience laughing)"
55:39;55:40;"That wouldn't make any sense at all."
55:40;55:41;"That's a good one."
55:41;55:43;"And at the time that I changed my name,"
55:43;55:45;"which is back in, I was like,"
55:45;55:48;"that was a very hip thing to do, you see?"
55:48;55:49;"You had to change your name."
55:49;55:52;"Truth was not so important in those days."
55:52;55:53;"Hmm."
55:53;55:54;"(audience laughing)"
55:54;55:58;"Right, so, you know, and then I discovered"
55:58;56:00;"the truth is never important."
56:00;56:02;"(audience laughing)"
56:02;56:05;"1969, wow."
56:05;56:06;"I love this."
56:06;56:07;"Anybody stick ball?"
56:07;56:09;"(audience laughing)"
56:09;56:13;"But, no, and I discovered like that all kinds of people,"
56:13;56:15;"you know, it didn't matter the age."
56:15;56:17;"Everybody that wanted to go into show business"
56:17;56:18;"changed his name, didn't matter."
56:18;56:22;"For example, just think about magnificent romantic image"
56:22;56:24;"such as Cary Grant."
56:24;56:27;"Now, his real name is Archibald Leach, see?"
56:27;56:28;"Or Leach or something like that."
56:28;56:31;"So, I mean, imagine that guy running down"
56:31;56:33;"in the midst of that temple in Gunga Dean, you know,"
56:33;56:34;"saying, ""On the name of our majesty,"
56:34;56:35;"""you're all under arrest,"""
56:35;56:36;"and his name is Archibald Leach."
56:36;56:39;"I mean, nobody would believe that, see?"
56:39;56:40;"But Cary Grant, he could do it and get away with it."
56:40;56:43;"Or Robert Taylor's real name is Spangler Arlington Brew,"
56:43;56:46;"which sounds like something you should drink"
56:46;56:48;"instead of go to sea, you know?"
56:48;56:51;"But, so that's how Bob Dylan's real name"
56:51;56:52;"is Bob Zimmerman, you know what I mean?"
56:52;56:54;"So, I mean, we're all show business."
56:54;56:56;"- Wow, Bob reference, I know."
56:56;56:58;"- It all creeps into us sooner or later."
56:58;56:59;"In any event, I started talking about this album"
56:59;57:03;"and there's a selection in it, which goes like so."
57:05;57:15;"- You're just like at the bar of the Troubadour."
57:15;57:16;"- Two more whiskey sours."

57:22;57:23;"- This sounds so good."
57:23;57:24;"- Yeah, this is sick."
57:24;57:26;"I got very curious about these."
57:26;57:27;"- This is live at the Troubadour?"
57:27;57:30;"- Yeah, he's working with a four-piece band."
57:30;57:33;"- People just could play on another level back then."

57:46;57:48;"and try to track down some of those"
57:48;57:51;"self-released Bobby Dyran records."
57:51;57:52;"- That was really fascinating."
57:52;57:56;"It's also so funny too that in 1969,"
57:56;58:00;"he had probably just turned 33."
58:00;58:00;"- Yeah."
58:00;58:04;"- And it's just interesting how back then,"
58:04;58:07;"culture shifted, especially in the '60s,"
58:07;58:09;"was shifting in such a major way."
58:09;58:12;"A guy like him, he probably felt so ancient."
58:12;58:14;"He probably felt like he'd lived five lives."
58:14;58:17;"When he references Mack the Knife,"
58:17;58:20;"which would have been a decade earlier,"
58:20;58:22;"it probably felt like 30 years,"
58:22;58:23;"the way he's talking about it."
58:23;58:26;"Yeah, I mean, Mack, everything's different."
58:26;58:28;"He's just struggling to find himself."
58:28;58:31;"But here, him on stage at the Troubadour,"
58:31;58:33;"he's the same age as Taylor Swift now."
58:33;58:34;"- Right."
58:34;58:36;"- Whereas now, a lot of artists,"
58:36;58:39;"by the time they hit 33, it's a little bit like,"
58:39;58:42;"okay, kind of entering a new phase."
58:42;58:45;"The youth phase is more or less over,"
58:45;58:48;"tiptoeing into adulthood."
58:48;58:50;"Whereas back then, this dude probably felt"
58:50;58:55;"like what we would consider a 55-year-old man now."
58:55;58:55;"- Oh, for sure."
58:58;59:01;"- Stay with me."
59:01;59:03;"- And the way it sounds like,"
59:03;59:06;"he was at this point pretty washed up."
59:06;59:08;"None of the labels were interested in him."
59:08;59:11;"Self-releasing his weird hippie music."
59:11;59:16;"It's just like, I wonder who was at these shows in '69."
59:16;59:18;"'Cause it wasn't, I doubt it was the youth,"
59:18;59:21;"but it was the cool 22-year-olds."

59:43;59:46;"(laughing)"
59:46;59:48;"- Let's go get some margaritas."
59:48;59:49;"- Splash, let's get the hell out of here."
59:49;59:52;"It's also fun when you picture this generation of dudes,"
59:52;59:55;"like Bobby Darn seems like an interesting guy,"
59:55;59:58;"but it is too bad that like,"
59:58;01:00:02;"I guess everybody's so susceptible just to kind of trends,"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"that even back then, a guy like Bobby Darn probably felt"
01:00:04;01:00:07;"like there's some really important stuff going on out there."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"It's important that I speak on it."
01:00:09;01:00:11;"I want to stand in my truth."
01:00:11;01:00:13;"I don't want these, like he's saying,"
01:00:13;01:00:14;"I don't want these labels giving me"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"their fake corporate version of protest."
01:00:16;01:00:17;"I want to do it from the heart."
01:00:17;01:00:19;"I've been reading things."
01:00:19;01:00:20;"I've been looking around at the world."
01:00:20;01:00:24;"I got something to say, but then he's doing this pretty well."
01:00:24;01:00:26;"I'm not knocking it."
01:00:26;01:00:30;"It's just that still his version of standing in his truth"
01:00:30;01:00:34;"as a 33 year old guy still just sounds like the music"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"of the moment, you know?"
01:00:36;01:00:37;"It would just be so much more interesting"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"if there's a guy like him, Bobby Darn, he said,"
01:00:39;01:00:40;"""You know, my real name is,"
01:00:40;01:00:43;"""my real last name is not Darn, it's Casado."
01:00:43;01:00:46;"""I'm an Italian guy, I was born in East Harlem."
01:00:46;01:00:49;"""I used to do this kind of old fashioned showbiz stuff."
01:00:49;01:00:53;"""And then in 1966, I took acid for the first time."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"""And I've been getting back to my roots"
01:00:55;01:00:58;"""and I've doing kind of like a psychedelic,"
01:00:58;01:01:03;"""Roman Catholic interpretation of big band music."""
01:01:03;01:01:04;"- Yeah."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"- It's just too bad that like,"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"there weren't more like weird things"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"where people had that experience"
01:01:08;01:01:10;"and they did something totally different."
01:01:10;01:01:11;"Like, that's what you would hope."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"It'd be like, oh, Bobby Darn takes acid"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"and starts reading the Tibetan book of the dead."
01:01:15;01:01:18;"He's not gonna make music that sounds like"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"Bob Dylan, Jefferson Airplane, whatever."
01:01:20;01:01:24;"He's gonna do psychedelic Italian big band music."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"[laughing]"
01:01:26;01:01:27;"But we never got that."
01:01:27;01:01:28;"- Yeah, I mean-- - Maybe somebody else did it."
01:01:28;01:01:32;"- Maybe some weird like Walker Brothers stuff or like--"
01:01:32;01:01:33;"- Right."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"- It's funny 'cause you know,"
01:01:34;01:01:35;"like Del Shannon put out a record"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"around the same time period"
01:01:37;01:01:41;"called ""The Continuing Adventures of Charles Wendover,"""
01:01:41;01:01:44;"which I believe that was his real name."
01:01:44;01:01:45;"- Whoa."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"- It's kind of similar where it's like a guy"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"who was a big star in the late '50s"
01:01:48;01:01:52;"kind of puts out his weird late '60s, early '70s"
01:01:52;01:01:55;"like psych folk record."
01:01:55;01:01:56;"- They all tend to have something in common."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"They're like hitting the same themes."
01:01:58;01:02:00;"It is funny that nobody,"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"none of these guys got into the counterculture"
01:02:02;01:02:06;"and read the books and took the drugs and then like,"
01:02:06;01:02:07;"or just, you know."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"- Made like Buddy Holly--"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"- Invented minimalist techno."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"- Or did like, almost like a,"
01:02:12;01:02:16;"just teeny bopper Buddy Holly stuff."
01:02:16;01:02:19;"Like songs that they could have written 10 years prior"
01:02:19;01:02:23;"when they were like forming their aesthetic pathways."
01:02:23;01:02:23;"But then just, yeah,"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"like wrote like Buddy Holly style songs"
01:02:25;01:02:26;"or Everly Brothers songs"
01:02:26;01:02:30;"about like transcendental meditation or whatever."
01:02:30;01:02:32;"- Right, yeah, that would have been interesting too."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"It's like you come back from seeing ""Beyond the Veil"""
01:02:34;01:02:37;"and say, you know, the main thing I realized"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"was that, you know, time isn't real"
01:02:39;01:02:42;"and I am gonna eternally make music"
01:02:42;01:02:46;"that sounds like 1959 'cause it just doesn't matter."
01:02:46;01:02:50;"That 1959 is as present as 1969,"
01:02:50;01:02:53;"but my lyrics are gonna be informed by my experience"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"seeing the face of God"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"and understanding the oneness of all things."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"- That'd be so sick."
01:02:58;01:03:01;"Just like the exact same arrangements as ""Mack the Knife"""
01:03:01;01:03:04;"except it's Tibetan Book of the Dead lyrics."
01:03:04;01:03:06;"- Buddy Holly to me is one of the real like,"
01:03:06;01:03:09;"I mean, there's so many like what ifs in rock history"
01:03:09;01:03:10;"of people that died way too young,"
01:03:10;01:03:15;"but what would Buddy Holly have been doing in 1969?"
01:03:15;01:03:16;"- Great question."
01:03:16;01:03:19;"- You know, we'll never know."
01:03:19;01:03:21;"But yeah, maybe this Bobby Darin thing"
01:03:21;01:03:26;"is a weird adjacent answer to that question."
01:03:26;01:03:30;"- Back to Bob, it's interesting that Bob Dylan is,"
01:03:30;01:03:33;"I mean, it kind of shows what everybody's always known"
01:03:33;01:03:38;"is that Bob Dylan, he's mystical, he's inscrutable,"
01:03:38;01:03:42;"he can seem kind of capricious at times,"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"but he is kind of what he says he is."
01:03:44;01:03:48;"You know, when he's the voice of a generation"
01:03:48;01:03:52;"writing these like kind of unbelievable songs"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"that speak to the moment,"
01:03:54;01:03:58;"pulling this like deep, weird poetry out of the universe."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"And then in the late '60s,"
01:03:59;01:04:02;"when kind of the hippies go mainstream,"
01:04:02;01:04:03;"he becomes a little bit trad."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"He's making like a-"
01:04:05;01:04:06;"- Nashville Skyline."
01:04:06;01:04:09;"- You know, he's making Nashville Skyline,"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"distancing himself from the counterculture."
01:04:11;01:04:14;"And then eventually he ends up in his kind of groove"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"where people are like, ""What's up with you, man?"
01:04:15;01:04:16;"""Why'd you bend on stuff?"""
01:04:16;01:04:17;"And his vibe is kind of like,"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"""Listen, I'm just an entertainer."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"""I write songs, I perform them."""
01:04:21;01:04:22;"And you know, everybody always thinks"
01:04:22;01:04:25;"he's being a little bit ironic when he says that,"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"because obviously there's so much weird,"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"vibey stuff in his music."
01:04:29;01:04:32;"And yet there probably is a pretty strong degree of truth"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"in that where he,"
01:04:34;01:04:37;"there might be a type of weird mysticism"
01:04:37;01:04:38;"that comes out in the music,"
01:04:38;01:04:39;"but at the end of the day,"
01:04:39;01:04:42;"he's a dude who, he is a song and dance man,"
01:04:42;01:04:44;"and he loves songs, and he loves showbiz."
01:04:44;01:04:47;"- He changed his name, just like Cary Grant."
01:04:47;01:04:50;"- And also, I mean, I'm sure many people have referenced this"
01:04:50;01:04:51;"and we happen to be talking about"
01:04:51;01:04:53;"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."
01:04:53;01:04:57;"Quentin Tarantino also just dropped a book of film criticism"
01:04:57;01:04:58;"which I haven't heard. - Oh yeah."
01:04:58;01:04:59;"- Have you heard about this, Jake?"
01:04:59;01:05:01;"- I've heard about it, yeah."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"- It's eerily similar, I would say."
01:05:02;01:05:04;"It's, from what I've read about it,"
01:05:04;01:05:08;"it's Tarantino talking about his early movie-going"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"experiences and films from the '70s"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"that he considers to be important."
01:05:12;01:05:14;"I don't know if his book's a little more personal,"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"but it's, he's somebody who's always said"
01:05:16;01:05:20;"he loves film criticism, he's influenced by film writing,"
01:05:20;01:05:22;"he famously worked at a video store,"
01:05:22;01:05:24;"he loves the history of cinema,"
01:05:24;01:05:27;"he likes talking about cinema, he likes,"
01:05:27;01:05:28;"I tried listening, he has a podcast."
01:05:28;01:05:30;"- I know, I checked it out."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"- With his boy, Roger Avery."
01:05:32;01:05:33;"- Yeah. - I listened to one episode"
01:05:33;01:05:36;"once and at a certain point,"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"I just had no idea what these guys were talking about"
01:05:38;01:05:40;"'cause I hadn't seen the movies."
01:05:40;01:05:41;"- Yeah. - It truly was like,"
01:05:41;01:05:44;"wow, these guys are still too dude to work at a video store"
01:05:44;01:05:47;"just talking about obscure movies"
01:05:47;01:05:49;"and they know the stuff inside and out."
01:05:49;01:05:54;"They know exactly when these directors made their movies,"
01:05:54;01:05:55;"they know who starred in them."
01:05:55;01:05:57;"These are guys who are just so passionate"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"about the history and the form."
01:05:59;01:06:01;"Anyway, there's something funny about him"
01:06:01;01:06:06;"releasing his book when Bob Dylan releases his song book"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"'cause they are people who,"
01:06:08;01:06:13;"as much as they might tap into something transcendent,"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"their vibe as human beings does seem to be"
01:06:15;01:06:18;"just like real regular fans."
01:06:18;01:06:21;"- People that are revered as incredible artists"
01:06:21;01:06:25;"but who also never lose sight of entertaining."
01:06:25;01:06:29;"- I read the novel, before this book,"
01:06:29;01:06:32;"Quin Tarantino just released the novelization"
01:06:32;01:06:35;"of ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."""
01:06:35;01:06:38;"And I read that and in that,"
01:06:38;01:06:39;"you learn more about Cliff Booth"
01:06:39;01:06:42;"and he's very into film."
01:06:42;01:06:43;"Did you read it, Jake?"
01:06:43;01:06:44;"- I read like half of it"
01:06:44;01:06:47;"and I put it down to read the Bob book, actually."

01:06:51;01:06:54;"That's sort of a back story that they,"
01:06:54;01:06:57;"you know, there's sort of his personality trait"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"that didn't make it into the film,"
01:06:59;01:07:02;"but there'll just be pages of him talking"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"or thinking about his,"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"just three pages of his favorite,"
01:07:06;01:07:09;"just listing his favorite samurai movies."
01:07:09;01:07:10;"- Yeah."
01:07:10;01:07:13;"- It's just, yeah, and there's a point like the podcast"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"where you're just like, I mean, I really am loving this,"
01:07:15;01:07:18;"but I have no idea what I'm reading anymore."
01:07:18;01:07:22;"- Yeah, Cliff goes to this cinema in little Tokyo"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"that must've existed in 1969"
01:07:24;01:07:27;"and watches like Japanese samurai movies."
01:07:27;01:07:29;"- Yeah, I remember reading that part of the book"
01:07:29;01:07:30;"and like, just like, okay,"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"I'm not gonna just keep reading the titles."

01:07:42;01:07:44;"what our generation's version of it is,"

01:07:51;01:07:55;"And I like when there's these kind of well-known figures"
01:07:55;01:07:57;"who do that."

01:08:29;01:08:31;"that I'm excited to learn about."
01:08:31;01:08:35;"- It's cool when an artist is like really passionate"

01:08:38;01:08:39;"to their own work."
01:08:39;01:08:42;"But yeah, Bob Dylan is, if Quentin Tarantino"
01:08:42;01:08:45;"is like the kind of video store generation,"

01:09:09;01:09:10;"- 'Cause in the book he's talking about,"

01:22:13;01:22:16;"is just work sucks, I know."
01:22:16;01:22:17;"- Yeah."
01:22:17;01:22:20;"- Sundays are like your looks peering into the void."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"- Oh, for sure."
01:22:21;01:22:23;"- You guys ever get the Sunday scaries?"
01:22:23;01:22:25;"Do you know about the Sunday scaries?"
01:22:25;01:22:27;"Is that more of like a knowledge worker,"
01:22:27;01:22:30;"like a office job type of thing?"
01:22:30;01:22:30;"- I don't know what that is."
01:22:30;01:22:31;"- I've heard of the Sunday scaries."
01:22:31;01:22:35;"It just means like you're scared about going to work"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"or you just have a bad, weird feeling."
01:22:37;01:22:40;"- Yeah, that's that pre-Monday kind of like,"
01:22:40;01:22:43;"you've got some work emails trickling in in the evening"
01:22:43;01:22:45;"that are trying to get ahead of the Monday rush."
01:22:45;01:22:49;"You're like, oh, I gotta adjust my sleep schedule now."
01:22:49;01:22:51;"I don't know, I got that project."
01:22:51;01:22:52;"- Right."
01:22:52;01:22:53;"- Yeah."
01:22:53;01:22:54;"- But you know what's weird?"
01:22:54;01:22:58;"I do think, and I think this is a good argument"
01:22:58;01:23:03;"for that all of our consciousnesses are connected into one,"
01:23:03;01:23:06;"is that I feel like a lot of people get that feeling"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"even when they don't have a job."
01:23:08;01:23:13;"There is something about, and I've had, you know,"
01:23:13;01:23:18;"pretty real regular type jobs in my life long time ago,"
01:23:18;01:23:21;"but there are times where I still feel it."
01:23:21;01:23:23;"And that truly is the danger zone"
01:23:23;01:23:26;"because if you play your cards right on a Sunday,"
01:23:26;01:23:27;"you spend time with people you love,"
01:23:27;01:23:31;"it could be very beautiful first half of a Sunday."
01:23:31;01:23:32;"If you're waking up hungover,"
01:23:32;01:23:36;"slam two, live by yourself and slam two beers,"
01:23:36;01:23:39;"walk out the door and smell other people's fried chicken,"
01:23:39;01:23:40;"that's gonna be tough."
01:23:40;01:23:44;"But if you have friends and family, Sunday can be great."
01:23:44;01:23:47;"Have a nice breakfast, walk around, do this."
01:23:47;01:23:50;"But even when you have a lot of stability in your life,"
01:23:50;01:23:52;"I do think the Sunday scaries sneak"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"into the collective consciousness."
01:23:54;01:23:57;"I haven't had, I don't work an office job,"
01:23:57;01:24:00;"and yeah, Sunday evening is like,"
01:24:00;01:24:01;"it can be kind of a strange vibe."
01:24:01;01:24:04;"- I wonder how, 'cause you know how in some calendars,"
01:24:04;01:24:05;"Sunday is the first day of the week,"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"like it's not actually Monday."
01:24:07;01:24:11;"I wonder if that has anything to do with this."
01:24:11;01:24:13;"- Because it's the first day of the week."
01:24:13;01:24:13;"- Yeah, like-"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"- Maybe it's because it's not settled."
01:24:15;01:24:16;"Some people say Sunday is the first day of the week,"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"some people say Monday."
01:24:17;01:24:19;"It's weird, we don't know."
01:24:19;01:24:21;"- It's the uncertainty of it."
01:24:21;01:24:22;"- It's the ambiguity."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"I think, according to Wikipedia,"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"it actually looks like in the West,"
01:24:26;01:24:28;"Sunday is the first day of the week."
01:24:28;01:24:32;"Is that your, Jake, is that your understanding?"
01:24:32;01:24:34;"- No, Monday is the first day of the week."
01:24:34;01:24:35;"I don't-"
01:24:35;01:24:36;"- I've seen it on calendars."
01:24:36;01:24:37;"- I don't buy into that."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"I mean, yes, Sunday is the first day in the calendar,"
01:24:39;01:24:42;"but I, there was a first column on the left,"
01:24:42;01:24:43;"but it doesn't track."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"Monday is the first day of the week."
01:24:45;01:24:46;"- The show rules."
01:24:46;01:24:50;"I'm looking at a Wikipedia map here"
01:24:50;01:24:53;"that's color-coded by the days of the week,"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"and we've got like Russia, parts of Africa,"
01:24:55;01:24:58;"Australia, Monday is the first day."
01:24:58;01:25:01;"That's a wall of blue from North America"
01:25:01;01:25:02;"down to South America."
01:25:02;01:25:03;"- It's a blue wave."
01:25:04;01:25:06;"(laughing)"
01:25:06;01:25:07;"- But I just want to say something,"
01:25:07;01:25:10;"regardless of if you think Sunday is the first day"
01:25:10;01:25:11;"of the week or Monday is,"
01:25:11;01:25:12;"we can all agree that after Monday,"
01:25:12;01:25:14;"you're usually gonna get Tuesday."
01:25:14;01:25:16;"Then Wednesday, some people call that hump day."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"- Oh yeah."
01:25:17;01:25:20;"- Then Thursday, things get pretty interesting."
01:25:20;01:25:23;"There's a real vibe shift on Thursday."
01:25:23;01:25:24;"- Yeah, that order is universal."
01:25:24;01:25:28;"- And then Friday and Saturday, everybody's having a ball."
01:25:28;01:25:29;"Here's the truth,"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"is that Monday is the first day of the week,"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"Saturday is the last day of the week,"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"and Sunday is the void."
01:25:35;01:25:38;"- So what happens when, you know,"
01:25:38;01:25:41;"I believe the UK has been experimenting"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"with a four-day work week."
01:25:43;01:25:44;"- Really?"
01:25:44;01:25:44;"Wow."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"- Yes."
01:25:45;01:25:46;"Yeah, that's--"
01:25:46;01:25:47;"- Nationally?"
01:25:47;01:25:48;"Wow."
01:25:48;01:25:49;"- Nationally, they, I think,"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"spent the summer on a four-day work week."
01:25:51;01:25:52;"Certainly, there's news that I'd read."
01:25:52;01:25:56;"So what happens, do we just, so three-day weekend."
01:25:56;01:25:58;"- So they work Monday through Thursday"
01:25:58;01:25:59;"and you get Friday off?"
01:25:59;01:26:00;"- Yeah."
01:26:00;01:26:02;"- I wonder if that could backfire."
01:26:02;01:26:04;"I mean, I'd like to imagine those people get--"
01:26:04;01:26:06;"- They should do Monday off."
01:26:06;01:26:07;"- Oh, that'd be interesting."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"Yeah, to take the sting out of Sunday."
01:26:09;01:26:11;"- You gotta keep Friday, Friday."
01:26:11;01:26:13;"- No more scaries."
01:26:13;01:26:15;"- Of course, everybody should work a little bit less"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"and deserves more time off,"
01:26:17;01:26:18;"but I wonder if it'll be one of those things,"
01:26:18;01:26:21;"like when they start adding lanes to highways"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"to help with the traffic congestion"
01:26:23;01:26:26;"and it just gets worse somehow,"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"if it'll be like something where"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"having Friday and Saturday off,"
01:26:30;01:26:33;"actually, it's like you're pulling back a rubber band"
01:26:33;01:26:37;"and you get even more hardcore Sunday scaries on Sunday."
01:26:37;01:26:39;"And actually, you know, in 10 years,"
01:26:39;01:26:40;"they'll look back and be like,"

01:29:36;01:29:37;"quite a bit."

01:29:52;01:29:55;"They're very, yeah, excellent, excellent album."
01:29:55;01:29:57;"And I'll be having ""Dirt"" nights"
01:29:57;01:29:58;"for the foreseeable future."
01:29:58;01:29:59;"- Well, there's another record"
01:29:59;01:30:03;"that celebrated a 30th anniversary just this past week."
01:30:03;01:30:05;"That came out in November of 1992,"
01:30:05;01:30:09;"and that's Ween's major label debut on Elektra Records,"
01:30:09;01:30:12;"a division of Warner Communications."
01:30:12;01:30:16;"Their record ""Pure Guava,"" which was their third album."
01:30:16;01:30:20;"But I was reading the 33rd and third book on it."
01:30:20;01:30:22;"Well, actually, it's on,"
01:30:22;01:30:25;"there's a 33 and a third book on ""Chocolate and Cheese,"""
01:30:25;01:30:27;"which was the one they did after ""Pure Guava."""
01:30:27;01:30:29;"But there's a whole chapter about ""Pure Guava,"""
01:30:29;01:30:32;"and it's talking about after Nebraska,"
01:30:32;01:30:37;"""Pure Guava"" was the second low-five four-track record"
01:30:37;01:30:41;"released by a major label, which I thought was fascinating."
01:30:41;01:30:43;"- Yeah, interesting."
01:30:43;01:30:46;"- Anyway, I love, this is sort of all an aside,"
01:30:46;01:30:49;"but ""Pure Guava"" has been one of my,"
01:30:49;01:30:52;"it's my favorite Ween album, which is saying a lot,"
01:30:52;01:30:53;"'cause that's a band I love."
01:30:53;01:30:55;"- Are you a bunch of a Ween guy?"
01:30:55;01:30:56;"I mean, I know we've touched on them"
01:30:56;01:30:57;"a little bit on the show."
01:30:57;01:30:59;"- I've never gone deep on Ween."
01:30:59;01:31:01;"They're one of those bands that I always assume"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"I'll have my moment with,"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"because people that I like, like you,"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"and people I knew growing up,"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"that they always seemed like a cool band."
01:31:09;01:31:13;"And especially, I knew that they were from,"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"not that far away from New Jersey and Pennsylvania,"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"and they just kind of seemed like,"
01:31:17;01:31:20;"yeah, New Hope, a place where I've been, Bucks County, PA."
01:31:20;01:31:23;"So they're just one of those bands"
01:31:23;01:31:24;"where I just felt like, oh yeah, they seem fun."
01:31:24;01:31:29;"And I always knew the song ""Spirit of '76."""
01:31:29;01:31:30;"- ""Freedom,"" yeah."
01:31:30;01:31:32;"- Oh, ""Freedom of '76,"" yeah."
01:31:32;01:31:34;"And I was always like, it was funny,"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"but the chords are so sophisticated."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"So I always had a feeling one day I'll get in,"
01:31:38;01:31:42;"but they strike me as a band similar to Bobby Darin."
01:31:42;01:31:44;"They're so chameleon-like that you could only"
01:31:44;01:31:47;"really get them probably when you've listened deeply,"
01:31:47;01:31:51;"because I love ""Freedom of '76."""
01:31:51;01:31:54;"I love, I hear that song, ""Ocean Man."""
01:31:54;01:31:56;"- ""Ocean Man."""
01:31:56;01:31:58;"Well, I mean, that's actually a lot of funny tie-ins"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"with Bobby Darin, not only, yeah,"
01:32:00;01:32:03;"I couldn't let our chameleon episode go by"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"without referencing ""Wean."""
01:32:05;01:32:08;"And also they put out that record, ""The Mollusk,"""
01:32:08;01:32:11;"which features ""Ocean Man,"" which is their ocean-based,"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"water-based nautical album,"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"much like Bobby Darin's early work."
