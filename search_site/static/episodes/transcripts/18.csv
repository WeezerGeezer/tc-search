02:04;02:05;"- A little clip from our good friend, Makonnen."
02:05;02:07;"Makonnen's not here right now."
02:07;02:09;"I tried to get him, he said he's in Paris."
02:09;02:12;"I gotta do some research to make sure that's true."
02:12;02:13;"But you know who's back?"
02:13;02:15;"We got the New York Time Crisis crew."
02:15;02:17;"Cousin Asher, what's up?"
02:17;02:18;"- What's up, Ezra?"
02:18;02:19;"- Welcome back to Time Crisis."
02:19;02:20;"- Thank you."
02:20;02:22;"- And of course, Despot, aka Alec."
02:22;02:23;"What's up, man?"
02:23;02:24;"- Hi."
02:24;02:24;"- So how's it been going, guys?"
02:24;02:26;"It's been a while."
02:26;02:27;"- Good."
02:27;02:28;"It's been a minute since you've been here."
02:28;02:29;"- I know."
02:29;02:31;"I've been out in LA, getting tan."
02:31;02:33;"- Do you feel like a trader?"
02:33;02:35;"- Yeah, well, you know what, man?"
02:35;02:37;"This is not the first time you've called me a trader."
02:37;02:37;"- I know."
02:37;02:38;"- Here's the thing."
02:38;02:40;"I'm still a New York resident."
02:40;02:42;"I'm paying income tax in New York."
02:42;02:43;"- Yeah, but that's--"
02:43;02:44;"- Doesn't that mean anything to you?"
02:44;02:45;"- No, that means nothing."
02:45;02:47;"- When the garbage man comes to take out your trash,"
02:47;02:48;"I did that."
02:48;02:50;"- I have private sanitation."
02:50;02:51;"I live in a commercial building."
02:51;02:52;"- Really?"
02:52;02:53;"- Yeah."
02:53;02:54;"So no, it doesn't mean anything to me."
02:54;02:56;"- No, the only thing that matters is if you're here for--"
02:56;02:58;"- What about the police who protect you?"
02:58;02:59;"- Yeah, thanks a lot."
02:59;03:01;"- That's not thanks to you."
03:01;03:02;"- Bad example."
03:02;03:03;"You have to be here for the winter."
03:03;03:04;"- Central Park."
03:04;03:05;"- Central Park, as a New Yorker."
03:05;03:07;"- Haven't been to Central Park in a while."
03:07;03:07;"- Yeah, I saw you."
03:07;03:10;"Next time Alec is taking his French poodle"
03:10;03:14;"for a walk in Central Park, remember I paid for that."
03:14;03:16;"- No, 'cause you didn't pay for the poodle."
03:16;03:18;"- Fair enough."
03:18;03:19;"Listen, guys, I love New York."
03:19;03:22;"I wanna spend more time here."
03:22;03:23;"- You could've probably been,"
03:23;03:27;"you maybe should've been the New York tourism ambassador"
03:27;03:29;"instead of T-Swift, but maybe because--"
03:29;03:31;"- She's spent probably a lot more time here though."
03:31;03:32;"- Yeah, you just never--"
03:32;03:33;"- No way, there is no way that Taylor Swift--"
03:33;03:34;"- Honestly, it makes a lot more sense."
03:34;03:35;"- No, there is no way."
03:35;03:37;"- All right, so explain why you're,"
03:37;03:39;"why are you not the ambassador then?"
03:39;03:40;"'Cause you're a traitor probably."
03:40;03:41;"- I'll tell you why."
03:41;03:45;"Because De Blasio, he just wants more--"
03:45;03:46;"- A pretty face."
03:46;03:47;"- He just wants a pretty face."
03:47;03:48;"(laughing)"
03:48;03:51;"I mean, I know Taylor Swift's more than a pretty face."
03:51;03:53;"It's actually really sexist, I like it."
03:53;03:57;"Disgusting, but no, I think the powers that be,"
03:57;03:59;"the people who run New York, they don't wanna see--"
03:59;04:00;"- Who are the people who run New York?"
04:00;04:01;"Jay-Z, for example?"
04:01;04:02;"- Yeah, what are the powers?"
04:02;04:04;"- Okay, good, 'cause you know who I saw last week"
04:04;04:08;"at the Beyonce show in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena?"
04:08;04:09;"Jay-Z, you know why?"
04:09;04:11;"Because Jay-Z lives in Los Angeles."
04:11;04:12;"- That's true."
04:12;04:13;"- I thought you were gonna say, ""Broke the policy."""
04:13;04:16;"- But he put a lot of time in over here first."
04:16;04:18;"- Why are you sticking up for Jay-Z?"
04:18;04:19;"- I like Jay-Z."
04:19;04:21;"- Okay, but first of all--"
04:21;04:24;"- I don't like when he said all that mean stuff about Nas."
04:24;04:26;"- Right, that's your dark taste."
04:26;04:27;"Where does Nas live?"
04:27;04:29;"- Probably here."
04:29;04:30;"- Doubt it."
04:30;04:31;"- Nah, he probably lives here."
04:31;04:32;"I'm sure he has a house out there."
04:32;04:33;"- Well, anyway, first of all--"
04:33;04:36;"- Nas does very well on the stock market."
04:36;04:36;"He has--"
04:36;04:37;"- Oh yeah, I heard he's a big investor."
04:37;04:40;"But anyway, as far as, yeah, Jay-Z put his time in here,"
04:40;04:43;"but as soon as he had a daughter, he took her to LA."
04:43;04:45;"He didn't wanna raise Blue Ivy in New York."
04:45;04:46;"- Yeah, he wants her to be soft."
04:46;04:47;"- That makes sense."
04:47;04:49;"(laughing)"
04:49;04:51;"- But I mean, she's a girl, I guess, you know."
04:51;04:52;"- That makes sense."
04:52;04:54;"If you had a daughter, you're killing me"
04:54;04:55;"with the misogyny today."
04:55;04:58;"- I'm just trying to be as sexist as possible on this show."
04:58;04:58;"- When I have, well actually,"
04:58;04:59;"I don't know where I'll raise my daughter."
04:59;05:01;"I don't wanna guarantee I'll raise my daughter in New York."
05:01;05:04;"- My daughter would definitely be raised in New York,"
05:04;05:05;"as would my son."
05:05;05:06;"- Where, there's a lot of good private schools here."
05:06;05:08;"I understand why you wanna make--"
05:08;05:09;"(laughing)"
05:09;05:10;"- What?"
05:10;05:11;"- But you're gonna make your daughter go to public school?"
05:11;05:12;"- Absolutely."
05:12;05:14;"- You're gonna make her go to New York public school?"
05:14;05:15;"- Yes."
05:15;05:15;"- Okay, I respect that."
05:15;05:18;"- You're gonna make her go to your public school in Queens?"
05:18;05:21;"- Maybe, PS 220, pretty good school."
05:21;05:24;"- If in 14 years I find out that you sent your daughter"
05:24;05:26;"to Dalton or one of these upper crust--"
05:26;05:27;"- Avenues."
05:27;05:29;"- Rich kids schools, so help me God."
05:29;05:30;"- What are you gonna do?"
05:30;05:32;"- I will play the audio of this again"
05:32;05:34;"for Time Crisis season 15."
05:34;05:35;"- It'll never happen."
05:35;05:38;"I also never have a kid, so."
05:38;05:41;"- You know, before we drop this topic,"
05:41;05:42;"I read on the internet a while ago,"
05:42;05:45;"and this really shook me to my core"
05:45;05:45;"when I first found it out,"
05:45;05:50;"that apparently Ivy, in blue Ivy,"
05:50;05:52;"stands for Illuminati's very youngest."
05:52;05:53;"- Oh yeah, I know about that."
05:53;05:54;"- And that really shook me to my core."
05:54;05:55;"And then I was talking about it"
05:55;05:57;"with somebody the other day, and they said,"
05:57;05:59;"yeah, but she's gonna have that name for her whole life,"
05:59;06:00;"and they're always gonna be adding--"
06:00;06:01;"- Exactly."
06:01;06:02;"- New members of the Illuminati,"
06:02;06:03;"so how is she still Illuminati's very youngest?"
06:03;06:04;"And I said, you know what, that makes sense."
06:04;06:06;"Maybe that's not what it stood for."
06:06;06:07;"- Yeah, maybe not."

09:29;09:30;"as much as I should have."
09:30;09:31;"I have been here more than Taylor Swift"
09:31;09:33;"and Jay-Z put together though."
09:33;09:35;"- That's definitely not true."
09:35;09:36;"- It's true. - No."
09:36;09:38;"- I pay my taxes."
09:38;09:42;"So my question for you two knuckleheads,"
09:42;09:43;"what have I been missing out on?"
09:43;09:45;"I wanna hear each of your best stories"
09:45;09:47;"of what's happened in New York in the past six months."
09:47;09:49;"Asher, we're gonna start with you."
09:49;09:51;"- My story happened to me, but it's not in New York,"
09:51;09:52;"so you're just gonna have to deal with that."
09:52;09:55;"- All right, a story that happened to a New York resident."
09:55;09:57;"- It happened to a New York resident elsewhere."
09:57;10:00;"I went with my family to the Galapagos on a vacation."
10:00;10:01;"- I can't believe that you're--"
10:01;10:03;"- Just listen, just listen, just listen."
10:03;10:05;"- I literally cannot believe that your New York story"
10:05;10:07;"is going on vacation to the Galapagos."
10:07;10:08;"Okay, but all right."
10:08;10:10;"- We had to fly into Ecuador"
10:10;10:14;"and we get in at like three o'clock in the morning"
10:14;10:16;"and we're there, the whole airport's totally empty."
10:16;10:17;"It's the middle of the night"
10:17;10:19;"and we're waiting for our luggage"
10:19;10:20;"and we hear like this crazy noise"
10:20;10:22;"on the other side of the airport door."
10:22;10:25;"And it sounds like thousands of people."
10:25;10:27;"And we open the door to leave baggage claim"
10:27;10:30;"and there are literally thousands of people in Ecuador."
10:30;10:34;"All sorts of yellow Ecuador colors and flags and everything"
10:34;10:36;"and they go crazy when we open the door."
10:36;10:39;"We could not figure it out, it was the middle of the night."
10:39;10:40;"- Time crisis fans."
10:40;10:42;"- Yeah, it was all time crisis fans."
10:42;10:43;"Very big in Ecuador."
10:43;10:45;"We walked through the whole,"
10:45;10:46;"they had cleared a path for us"
10:46;10:49;"and everyone's going crazy and jumping over each other"
10:49;10:51;"to take pictures of us and we can't figure out"
10:51;10:53;"what is going on."
10:53;10:55;"And then we get to the taxi guy"
10:55;10:56;"that's gonna take us to the hotel"
10:56;11:01;"and he tells us that, you know the soccer star Ronaldinho?"
11:01;11:02;"- Brazilian."
11:02;11:03;"- Brazilian soccer star."
11:03;11:06;"He's coming in to play a friendly match"
11:06;11:08;"with the Ecuadorian soccer team"
11:08;11:10;"and he's coming in the same,"
11:10;11:12;"a flight at the exact same time as us"
11:12;11:13;"and everyone's there in the country"
11:13;11:16;"to greet him in the middle of the night."
11:16;11:17;"And everybody thought when we opened the door it was us."
11:17;11:19;"And no one could see because of the craziness."
11:19;11:20;"So everyone thought it was us"
11:20;11:22;"and they were all going crazy."
11:22;11:24;"So we go through, everyone was so upset"
11:24;11:25;"when they realized it wasn't us."
11:25;11:28;"And we get through and we get into the taxi."
11:28;11:30;"He's explaining to us and there's people all in the streets"
11:30;11:33;"and we drive and we get to the hotel"
11:33;11:35;"and we realize that the hotel is the same hotel"
11:35;11:36;"that he's staying at."
11:36;11:37;"And it's like the middle,"
11:37;11:39;"it's like four in the morning at that point"
11:39;11:41;"and the entire front of the hotel is just swamped"
11:41;11:42;"with like thousands of people"
11:42;11:44;"and they have to like clear out a path"
11:44;11:46;"to get our car in and they get it in"
11:46;11:48;"and we can just tell like everyone's gonna be so pissed off"
11:48;11:50;"when they open the door."
11:50;11:52;"I'm Ronaldinho and everyone's going crazy"
11:52;11:55;"and they're like crying and waving all these things."
11:55;11:57;"And they open the door and people are just silent."
11:57;11:59;"They're just staring at us."
11:59;12:00;"Awkward."
12:00;12:01;"Like white family from New York"
12:01;12:03;"who just walk out and apologize to everybody."
12:03;12:04;"There you go."
12:04;12:05;"From New York."
12:05;12:06;"Yeah, exactly."
12:06;12:08;"They're back together again."
12:08;12:09;"That's a pretty wild story."
12:09;12:10;"Yeah, it was wild."
12:10;12:10;"That must have been pretty strange."
12:10;12:12;"Yeah, and then when he did come, people went crazy."
12:12;12:13;"I mean, they've--"
12:13;12:16;"Down in South America, they're gaga for soccer."
12:16;12:17;"And I've been saying this for years"
12:17;12:19;"'cause you guys know I've been all over the world."
12:19;12:21;"I've been around the world."
12:21;12:24;"And the passion I've seen for soccer"
12:24;12:25;"in some of these other countries,"
12:25;12:27;"I've been saying this for years."
12:27;12:30;"One day, soccer could be the number one sport in the world."
12:30;12:31;"(laughing)"
12:31;12:33;"What day is that?"
12:33;12:34;"I don't know."
12:34;12:36;"Probably around the time that Despot has a daughter."
12:36;12:38;"And an album."
12:38;12:41;"At Fieldston."
12:41;12:43;"An album at Fieldston."
12:43;12:45;"Yeah, actually, Despot needs to make an album"
12:45;12:47;"before he has a daughter."
12:47;12:47;"That's fair."
12:47;12:49;"Well, anyway."
12:49;12:52;"Despot, your story needs to take place in New York"
12:52;12:53;"after Asher took--"
12:53;12:54;"I didn't know that was a requirement."
12:54;12:55;"I didn't realize that was a requirement."
12:55;12:56;"I didn't even prep you properly."
12:56;12:57;"You didn't prep me, I'm sorry."
12:57;12:59;"You just said the best story of the last six months."
12:59;12:59;"Okay."
12:59;13:00;"I wasn't--"
13:00;13:01;"Despot, what's been going on with you?"
13:01;13:03;"What's your best story the past six months?"
13:03;13:05;"I don't really have a story."
13:05;13:07;"I also don't really remember"
13:07;13:10;"too much of what's been happening."
13:10;13:10;"Why?"
13:10;13:12;"I've been drinking a lot"
13:12;13:15;"and going out and staying out late a lot."
13:15;13:17;"Coming home at eight in the morning a lot."
13:17;13:19;"But still keeping up with my fitness."
13:19;13:21;"That was my first question,"
13:21;13:22;"'cause you know on Time Crisis,"
13:22;13:24;"health and fitness is very important to us."
13:24;13:26;"So, you were doing P90X,"
13:26;13:27;"you were getting like real diesel."
13:27;13:28;"Still am."
13:28;13:30;"With all the drinking, you can still stay diesel?"
13:30;13:33;"Yeah, it kinda helps to sweat the hangover out."
13:33;13:36;"Just pump some iron."
13:36;13:38;"Is it safe to do that forever?"
13:38;13:41;"Isn't the point of P90X, you do it for 90 days and then--"
13:41;13:42;"Nah, you do it forever."
13:42;13:43;"Oh, really?"
13:43;13:44;"You could do it--"
13:44;13:44;"P forever."
13:44;13:46;"What do you say after you do like--"
13:46;13:49;"Oh, the X is like, oh, X, X, infinity."
13:49;13:50;"I see."
13:50;13:53;"I did X3 first, then did X2,"
13:53;13:55;"then I did regular X."
13:55;13:56;"Now I'm just kinda mixing it up."
13:56;13:58;"What's the difference between X, X2, X3?"
13:58;13:59;"I'm glad you asked."
13:59;14:02;"X3 is only a half hour,"
14:02;14:05;"more of a beginner, intermediate thing."
14:05;14:08;"Kind of intense, but a half hour."
14:08;14:11;"Then X2 is probably the most difficult."
14:11;14:14;"It's very like acrobatic."
14:14;14:16;"Like you'll be balancing on one of those bouncy balls"
14:16;14:18;"and lifting weights and whatever"
14:18;14:20;"and doing all this crazy stuff."
14:20;14:23;"And then X is more traditional."
14:23;14:24;"You just max out."
14:24;14:26;"It's like do a million curls, do a million--"
14:26;14:29;"So basically for the past six months,"
14:29;14:31;"you've been working out all day,"
14:31;14:34;"partying all night, and you remember nothing."
14:34;14:35;"I don't remember too much."
14:35;14:37;"And the things that I do remember"
14:37;14:40;"are mostly like incriminating,"
14:40;14:42;"like a lot of illegal things."
14:42;14:44;"I broke the law a lot."
14:44;14:44;"X4."
14:44;14:46;"Especially in like the past month,"
14:46;14:48;"I really been breaking the law a lot."
14:48;14:49;"And yeah, I don't know."
14:49;14:50;"Well, we won't make you say anymore."
14:50;14:52;"I'll say, you know, I went,"
14:52;14:53;"it was just my birthday."
14:53;14:55;"I just turned 34."
14:55;14:55;"Oh, happy birthday, man."
14:55;14:56;"Happy birthday."
14:56;14:57;"Thanks."
14:57;14:59;"The night of my birthday,"
14:59;15:02;"well, no, the night before my birthday, May 6th,"
15:02;15:06;"I was feeling like a little, I don't know,"
15:06;15:08;"messed up from whatever I've been doing."
15:08;15:11;"And I went to a Dizzy Rascal show."
15:11;15:13;"He played the entire ""Boy in the Corner"" album."
15:13;15:14;"Great album."
15:14;15:16;"Yeah, and in my head, I was like,"
15:16;15:19;"this is gonna be weird 'cause I'm turning really old"
15:19;15:23;"and I'm gonna go see this guy play this album"
15:23;15:24;"from a long time ago."
15:24;15:25;"And I'm gonna feel old."
15:25;15:27;"Even Dizzy Rascal, he was a teenager"
15:27;15:28;"when he made that album."
15:28;15:29;"Yeah."
15:29;15:32;"So I went to the show kind of expecting"
15:32;15:34;"to just like feel weird and bad."
15:34;15:37;"And I did feel weird and bad,"
15:37;15:40;"but it was a really good show."
15:40;15:43;"And it was, I would say it was inspiring."
15:43;15:46;"And then it became my birthday during the show."
15:46;15:50;"And I was like, man, hey, you're not so old and washed up."
15:50;15:52;"You could like make some rap songs"
15:52;15:54;"and do your thing and be 34."
15:54;15:56;"So ultimately you felt good?"
15:56;15:57;"I felt good."
15:57;16:00;"I said hi to a lot of people who were saying hi to me"
16:00;16:02;"and I didn't know who they were."
16:02;16:03;"And that feels good."
16:03;16:04;"That was good."
16:04;16:05;"Yeah, that feels great."
16:05;16:06;"Yeah, it's positive."
16:06;16:07;"Yeah."
16:07;16:08;"As a birthday gift to you,"
16:08;16:11;"because you survived another year"
16:11;16:13;"and you rung in the new year with Dizzy Rascal."
16:13;16:15;"I wanna dedicate a Dizzy Rascal song to you."
16:15;16:18;"I was thinking ""Fix Up, Look Sharp,"""
16:18;16:21;"which is one of the less known songs on that album."
16:21;16:23;"So corny, Ezra."
16:23;16:24;"What is that sample?"
16:24;16:25;"That sample's Big Beat, right?"
16:25;16:27;"Yeah, Billy Squire."
16:27;16:27;"Could play that."
16:27;16:30;"That song, Upper West Side Resident."
16:30;16:33;"I feel like a song just came out that samples Big Beat."
16:33;16:35;"And I feel like every year a song comes out."
16:35;16:36;"They're always sampling Big Beat."
16:36;16:37;"Wait, okay."
16:37;16:38;"No, she doesn't even sample it."
16:38;16:39;"It's just called Big Beat."
16:39;16:39;"Oh, it's just called Big Beat."
16:39;16:41;"But no, but there is another one that just came out."
16:41;16:42;"There's always something."
16:42;16:43;"Yeah."
16:43;16:46;"So, happy 34th birthday to Death Spot."

23:55;23:58;"going to Ecuador and Dizzy Rascal concerts,"
23:58;24:00;"I've been putting in some real work."
24:00;24:01;"Over on the West Coast,"
24:01;24:04;"recording ""Time Crisis,"" recording music."
24:04;24:07;"- I'd gladly go record ""Time Crisis"" with you over there."
24:07;24:09;"- Yeah, anytime you wanna."
24:09;24:11;"- Okay, I'll make a promise."
24:11;24:12;"I'll make a promise."
24:12;24:16;"I'm gonna fly you two knuckleheads out to Hollywood."

24:18;24:22;"- But if they don't, I will put out my hard-earned cash."
24:22;24:23;"- That's nice of you."
24:23;24:25;"- To bring you guys. - That Airbnb's gonna suck."
24:25;24:27;"I can already tell that Airbnb's gonna suck."
24:27;24:27;"- It's gonna be a good Airbnb."
24:27;24:28;"- Just gotta have a pool."
24:28;24:29;"- Do we get to choose?"
24:29;24:30;"- We get to choose a pool."
24:30;24:31;"- No, I wanna surprise you guys."
24:31;24:33;"- Can we pick the neighborhood?"
24:33;24:34;"- I don't know, what neighborhood do you wanna stay in?"
24:34;24:35;"- Malibu."
24:35;24:36;"- You don't wanna stay in--"
24:36;24:38;"- Nah, it's too far, Glendale."
24:38;24:39;"- See, you guys don't know about it."
24:39;24:40;"- I think Glendale."
24:40;24:44;"- See, you guys don't know about LA stuff."
24:44;24:45;"I'm over--"
24:45;24:46;"(laughing)"
24:46;24:49;"Malibu's really far from Glendale."
24:49;24:50;"That's some LA stuff that I know."
24:50;24:53;"- I know, if you ever need to be at a house from Malibu--"
24:53;24:53;"- Silver Lake. - We don't ever have"
24:53;24:54;"to leave the house."
24:54;24:55;"- You know what, Alex? - Just put us in Silver Lake."
24:55;24:57;"- I'm gonna put you, my friend,"
24:57;24:59;"I'm putting in historic Filipino town."

27:25;27:29;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
27:29;27:33;"Filling in for our regular host, Fareed Zakaria."
27:33;27:34;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
27:34;27:36;"Beats..."
27:36;27:37;"one."
27:37;27:38;"You know, in New York, everybody's always talking"
27:38;27:42;"about pizza, hot dogs, and, you know, whatever."
27:42;27:43;"Philosophy, things like that."
27:43;27:44;"But in L.A.--"
27:44;27:45;"I thought you were gonna say falafels."
27:45;27:47;"And then you said philosophy."
27:47;27:49;"Falafel, see?"
27:49;27:52;"And then-- but in L.A., we've been getting into"
27:52;27:55;"a conversation about Doritos versus Fritos."
27:55;27:57;"And, you know, our West Coast correspondent,"
27:57;27:59;"Jake Longstreth, been doing some work"
27:59;28:01;"talking about Doritos versus Fritos."
28:01;28:04;"So I want to call Jake to kind of take the discussion"
28:04;28:06;"a bit deeper, but before we do that,"
28:06;28:08;"I was just wondering, were you guys--"
28:08;28:10;"Asher, are you more Doritos guy or Fritos guy?"
28:10;28:11;"You know what I am?"
28:11;28:13;"I'm a Fritos-- they got the barbecue--"
28:13;28:15;"they have a honey barbecue flavor of Fritos"
28:15;28:16;"that's like--"
28:16;28:17;"Really?"
28:17;28:18;"It's really different."
28:18;28:19;"It looks like rotini almost."
28:19;28:20;"Like, it's like a corkscrew shape."
28:20;28:23;"And they have this fake barbecue char on it."
28:23;28:24;"Too sweet?"
28:24;28:25;"It looks crazy."
28:25;28:26;"No, it's just sweet enough."
28:26;28:27;"It's a little sweet."
28:27;28:28;"Is that something you can just walk into a store"
28:28;28:30;"and get that, or are you ordering that in bulk"
28:30;28:31;"from Korea?"
28:31;28:33;"If you go to a vending machine at a public school,"
28:33;28:34;"you will definitely be able to get that."
28:34;28:35;"What are you doing in public school?"
28:35;28:37;"No, I'm just saying I grew up eating that"
28:37;28:38;"like every single day."
28:38;28:39;"Wait, those existed when we were kids?"
28:39;28:40;"Yeah, definitely."
28:40;28:41;"Barbecue Fritos."
28:41;28:42;"Yeah."
28:42;28:44;"I never heard about that one."
28:44;28:46;"I was eating grandma's cookies."
28:46;28:49;"That was my vending machine snack of choice"
28:49;28:50;"at my public high school."
28:50;28:53;"We lived about five miles away, but worlds apart."
28:53;28:54;"Well, that's true."
28:54;28:56;"Is grandma's cookies like the Butter Crunch"
28:56;28:57;"and those things?"
28:57;28:59;"You get two big cookies in a pack."
28:59;29:00;"Yeah, I think that's--"
29:00;29:01;"They also did a chocolate one?"
29:01;29:03;"Yeah, the chocolate and chocolate."
29:03;29:04;"And they also did a chocolate chip, I believe."
29:04;29:05;"Yeah, and Butter Crunch."
29:05;29:06;"Yeah, I think."
29:06;29:07;"They might have even done a peanut butter."
29:07;29:08;"Unless I got it wrong."
29:08;29:10;"Alec, are you more of a Doritos?"
29:10;29:11;"Doritos."
29:11;29:12;"Absolutely."
29:12;29:13;"Doritos hamster."
29:13;29:14;"Cool ranch or nacho cheese?"
29:14;29:15;"Doritos definitely fits more with your bad boy image."
29:15;29:17;"Thank you."
29:17;29:19;"I saw that one coming a mile away."
29:19;29:21;"Wait, but here's my question."
29:21;29:22;"Which type of Doritos?"
29:22;29:23;"Cool ranch?"
29:23;29:25;"Nah, I kind of like nacho cheese if I'm"
29:25;29:27;"going for one or the other of the classics."
29:27;29:27;"Really?"
29:27;29:28;"Yeah."
29:28;29:29;"That's crazy."
29:29;29:30;"I kind of will go nacho cheese."
29:30;29:32;"On that note, let's call our West Coast correspondent,"
29:32;29:35;"Jake Longstreth, to get some real dirt"
29:35;29:38;"on the Doritos Fritos universe."
29:38;29:42;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
29:42;29:43;"[beeping]"
29:44;29:46;"[phone ringing]"
29:46;29:48;"Hey, Ezra."
29:48;29:50;"Hey, what's up, Jake?"
29:50;29:52;"You're on with the Time Crisis New York"
29:52;29:54;"crew, Despot and Asher."
29:54;29:55;"Oh, cool."
29:55;29:56;"Old school."
29:56;29:57;"Exactly."
29:57;29:59;"So Jake, we were just talking about Doritos and Fritos,"
29:59;30:04;"and the fan response to the last show, it was unreal."
30:04;30:05;"You know, while the show was airing,"
30:05;30:08;"briefly, #DoritosVsFritos."
30:08;30:09;"Wait, what's your position?"
30:09;30:11;"You didn't even say."
30:11;30:12;"Well, you know I'm agnostic on everything."
30:12;30:14;"OK."
30:14;30:15;"If the Frito-Lay company decides"
30:15;30:19;"that they want me to be the face of Fritos or Doritos,"
30:19;30:20;"the last thing that I need is somebody"
30:20;30:24;"digging up an old radio show where I chose sides."
30:24;30:26;"I mean, regardless, you're kind of--"
30:26;30:27;"Yeah, you're a Frito-Lays boy either way."
30:27;30:30;"No, but you're being divisive here,"
30:30;30:32;"so the company might not appreciate that either way."
30:32;30:33;"I guess I am inviting--"
30:33;30:35;"You're forcing people."
30:35;30:36;"I am inviting criticism of their products."
30:36;30:37;"Encouraging an atmosphere of intolerance."
30:37;30:38;"OK, I like Doritos."
30:38;30:39;"Good."
30:39;30:41;"Well said."
30:41;30:41;"So Jake--"
30:42;30:42;"Political answer."
30:42;30:46;"So Jake, as I said, people are going crazy."
30:46;30:49;"#DoritosVsFritos got over 2 million tweets."
30:49;30:51;"It was trending in 70 countries."
30:51;30:52;"People are going crazy about this discussion."
30:52;30:55;"It really struck a nerve with the citizens of Earth."
30:55;30:58;"We understand you've been digging a little bit deeper."
30:58;31:00;"You got some good facts for us?"
31:00;31:01;"Oh, yeah."
31:01;31:02;"All right, lay it on us."
31:02;31:03;"Wait, how about you?"
31:03;31:07;"What do you like better, Doritos or Fritos, man?"
31:07;31:08;"We discussed this, and I think as a child,"
31:08;31:10;"I would have gone with Doritos."
31:10;31:12;"And as an adult, a self-restraining adult,"
31:12;31:13;"I would go Fritos."
31:13;31:14;"That's interesting."
31:14;31:18;"Is that just because of getting the stuff on your fingers?"
31:18;31:19;"Yeah."
31:19;31:21;"It's just that Doritos are over the top."
31:21;31:22;"Yeah."
31:22;31:24;"It's not a good look."
31:24;31:26;"What if one of your friends pulls up in a Lamborghini,"
31:26;31:28;"you have to wave at them?"
31:28;31:30;"And all your fingertips are all orange."
31:30;31:32;"Or if you get caught licking that off or something."
31:32;31:33;"That's really gross."
31:33;31:34;"Yeah, you're just licking it."
31:34;31:35;"It's not a good look."
31:35;31:36;"That's disgusting."
31:36;31:38;"All right, so Jake, what did you find out"
31:38;31:40;"about Fritos and Doritos?"
31:40;31:41;"Where to start?"
31:41;31:42;"I mean, this was like an epic history,"
31:42;31:44;"as you might imagine."
31:44;31:46;"For the sake of brevity, let me just hit you"
31:46;31:47;"with some bullet points."
31:47;31:48;"Nice."
31:48;31:52;"Fritos was invented in the '30s in San Antonio, Texas."
31:52;31:53;"'30s, wow."
31:53;31:57;"Meanwhile, in North Carolina, the Lay's Potato Chip"
31:57;32:00;"Corporation was just getting going in the '30s as well."
32:00;32:02;"So two different companies."
32:02;32:05;"Yeah, yeah, the Frito Company and the Lay's Potato Chip"
32:05;32:07;"Company were separate companies."
32:07;32:09;"And they were very successful regionally."
32:09;32:14;"And then in 1961, they merged to form Frito-Lay."
32:14;32:16;"And then four years after that, it"
32:16;32:18;"started to get super global and corporate"
32:18;32:22;"because Frito-Lay merged with Pepsi Cola Company,"
32:22;32:23;"forming PepsiCo."
32:23;32:26;"Wait, Frito-Lay's is owned by Pepsi still?"
32:26;32:28;"PepsiCo, yeah."
32:28;32:29;"Still is."
32:29;32:31;"I think they also own like Pizza Hut, maybe Taco Bell."
32:31;32:32;"There's like a--"
32:32;32:33;"No, no, no."
32:33;32:34;"Well, they did until 1997."
32:34;32:35;"But that's also--"
32:35;32:36;"[LAUGHTER]"
32:36;32:38;"I don't think I've checked since 1997."
32:38;32:40;"All right, so PepsiCo--"
32:40;32:42;"so Frito-Lay, they come together, they're a powerhouse."
32:42;32:46;"PepsiCo says, you know, guys, we could take this even further."
32:46;32:48;"Becomes a global brand."
32:48;32:51;"Yeah, as of 2009, PepsiCo comprised 40%"
32:51;32:54;"of all savory snacks sold in the United States."
32:54;32:56;"Wow."
32:56;32:59;"And initially, there was this guy named Donald Kendall,"
32:59;33:01;"who was really tight with Richard Nixon."
33:01;33:02;"Oh, god."
33:02;33:05;"He was the CEO of PepsiCo."
33:05;33:07;"And actually, Nixon was PepsiCo's company lawyer"
33:07;33:09;"in the mid '60s."
33:09;33:12;"And PepsiCo in the late '60s was thinking"
33:12;33:15;"of marketing potato chips and Pepsi products"
33:15;33:16;"together in the same advertisements."
33:16;33:20;"Because to quote Donald Kendall, potato chips make you thirsty."
33:20;33:21;"[LAUGHTER]"
33:21;33:22;"Pepsi satisfies thirst."
33:22;33:23;"[LAUGHTER]"
33:23;33:24;"It was like a yummy--"
33:24;33:25;"Oh, my god."
33:25;33:26;"So you're telling me--"
33:26;33:27;"That's called synergy."
33:27;33:29;"OK, so you're telling me-- so these guys basically"
33:29;33:34;"invented a certain form of corporate synergy."
33:34;33:37;"They give you the taste of a Dorito or a Frito."
33:37;33:38;"You get thirsty."
33:38;33:41;"Now they're hitting you with Pepsi, which"
33:41;33:43;"is full of sugar, which is going to totally destroy"
33:43;33:46;"your metabolism and then make you want to eat more carbs."
33:46;33:47;"It's insane."
33:47;33:48;"And it goes so deep."
33:48;33:49;"I mean, I went down the rabbit hole"
33:49;33:51;"this afternoon with this stuff."
33:51;33:53;"Normally, when people say that something goes really deep,"
33:53;33:55;"the next line is, I think it goes all the way"
33:55;33:56;"to the very top."
33:56;33:58;"And in this instance, it literally"
33:58;34:00;"did go all the way to the very top,"
34:00;34:01;"to the President of the United States."
34:01;34:04;"So I'm picturing in my mind's eye"
34:04;34:09;"that a bunch of these corporate scumbags at PepsiCo were like,"
34:09;34:12;"Nixon, you're a hell of a lawyer,"
34:12;34:14;"but we need a man on the inside."
34:14;34:16;"We want to put you in the White House."
34:16;34:18;"And he's like, guys, I ran for president"
34:18;34:19;"before it didn't go very well."
34:19;34:21;"Nixon, we need you in the White House."
34:21;34:25;"We need a strong advocate for Pepsi and Frito-Lay products."
34:25;34:26;"And they did it."
34:26;34:28;"Dude, you are more right than you know."
34:28;34:30;"[LAUGHTER]"
34:33;34:37;", [MUSIC PLAYING]"
35:29;35:33;"This guy, Donald Kendall, who was the CEO of PepsiCo--"
35:33;35:35;"so Nixon was elected in '68."
35:35;35:39;"Kendall called Nixon in 1970 after Salvador Allende was"
35:39;35:45;"elected president of Chile, who was a very Marxist dude."
35:45;35:46;"A lefty."
35:46;35:47;"Yeah, he was going to nationalize everything"
35:47;35:49;"and kick out American corporations."
35:49;35:53;"And there was a big PepsiCo bottling plant in Chile."
35:53;35:55;"And he was going to boot them out."
35:55;35:57;"And then Kendall called Nixon."
35:57;36:00;"And so they were old buddies via the PepsiCo board."
36:00;36:01;"No."
36:01;36:02;"He was like, this is not going to stand, dude."
36:02;36:06;"And then in '73, the CIA helped with the coup to oust Allende."
36:06;36:09;"Oh my god."
36:09;36:13;"So you're telling me literally PepsiCo, and by extension"
36:13;36:18;"Fritos, Lay's, and Doritos, is pro-regime change."
36:18;36:19;"Yeah."
36:19;36:21;"I mean, you think about PepsiCo being a very"
36:21;36:23;"powerful American brand."
36:23;36:24;"You think about the Cold War."
36:24;36:28;"And you think about economic and political imperialism."
36:28;36:31;"It makes sense that PepsiCo is right in the mix"
36:31;36:34;"with the top dogs of politics."
36:34;36:35;"It's heavy, dude."
36:35;36:36;"Man--"
36:36;36:37;"[LAUGHTER]"
36:37;36:39;"That's one endorsement you're not going to get."
36:39;36:40;"I got a question for you, man."
36:40;36:41;"Yeah."
36:41;36:43;"If you're a peace-loving cola drinker who"
36:43;36:48;"doesn't want to see Marxist rebels getting murdered,"
36:48;36:50;"I mean, good lord, is there a cola that we can"
36:50;36:51;"drink and feel good about?"
36:51;36:52;"Tropical Fantasy."
36:52;36:53;"Maybe, you know, I think Trevor Joe's has--"
36:53;36:54;"Joe's."
36:54;36:55;"I was going to say--"
36:55;36:56;"Joe's Cola."
36:56;36:57;"What's that?"
36:57;36:58;"Joe's Cola."
36:58;36:59;"I never even heard of that."
36:59;37:03;"It's like the Bernie Sanders of cola."
37:03;37:04;"Right."
37:04;37:05;"Maybe Shasta."
37:05;37:06;"Tropical Fantasy, man."
37:06;37:07;"They make a cola."
37:07;37:08;"What about RC Cola?"
37:08;37:09;"I don't know."
37:09;37:10;"I think RC is probably--"
37:10;37:13;"RC stands for Really Communist."
37:13;37:14;"What about Faygo?"
37:14;37:15;"Oh, yeah."
37:15;37:17;"Maybe Faygo's still a regional brand."
37:17;37:18;"Is that cola?"
37:18;37:19;"I don't even know."
37:19;37:20;"They probably make a cola."
37:20;37:22;"Jake, thank you so much for your in-depth reporting, man."
37:22;37:25;"I got to say that finding out some of these horrifying"
37:25;37:28;"skeletons in PepsiCo's closet, it kind of makes"
37:28;37:32;"the whole Doritos versus Doritos debate seem a little slight."
37:32;37:36;"Ezra, do you have any idea how many different varieties"
37:36;37:39;"of Doritos have been introduced onto the market internationally?"
37:39;37:40;"How many?"
37:40;37:41;"106."
37:41;37:45;"They want to give us 106 different choices of Doritos,"
37:45;37:48;"but we can't even choose Marxism?"
37:48;37:51;"We get one choice of ideology, but 106 choices of Doritos."
37:51;37:54;"Can you tell us some of the more rare Doritos flavors?"
37:54;37:57;"I found a site today called taquito.net, which is"
37:57;37:59;"sort of the IMDB of snack food."
37:59;38:00;"Oh, yeah."
38:00;38:01;"Oh, OK."
38:01;38:03;"You just read a few of these."
38:03;38:05;"There's 106 different varieties, and a lot of these"
38:05;38:06;"are international."
38:06;38:09;"Doritos, first degree burn, blazin' jalapenos."
38:09;38:15;"Doritos, second degree burn, fiery buffalo."
38:15;38:19;"Doritos, third degree burn, scorchin' habanero."
38:19;38:20;"I've had that one."
38:20;38:22;"Doritos, baja picante."
38:22;38:25;"Doritos, baked cooler ranch tortilla chips."
38:25;38:28;"Dude, there's one that's peking duck."
38:28;38:32;"Have you seen the Doritos roulette chips?"
38:32;38:34;"Do you guys know about this?"
38:34;38:35;"Wait, you don't know what you're going to get?"
38:35;38:36;"Yeah, no, no, no."
38:36;38:37;"It's amazing."
38:37;38:39;"They launched in Canada, and then I think they brought"
38:39;38:41;"them here, but it didn't last very long."
38:41;38:44;"It's called Doritos roulette, and the idea is it's a normal"
38:44;38:48;"bag of Doritos, and then six chips in the bag are"
38:48;38:51;"inedibly spicy."
38:51;38:52;"And you just have no idea."
38:52;38:54;"They all look the same, so you just eat them,"
38:54;38:57;"and it became a YouTube cult sensation of people"
38:57;39:00;"filming themselves eating a bag of roulette chips,"
39:00;39:02;"so that you're just eating them, and you don't know"
39:02;39:04;"when it's going to happen, and then it happens,"
39:04;39:06;"and they just lose their-- it's like those ghost pepper videos."
39:06;39:07;"You know what?"
39:07;39:09;"It sounds like there's a lot of creativity going on"
39:09;39:11;"over at Doritos."
39:11;39:13;"Yeah, I think they're taking it as far as they can go."
39:13;39:16;"All of this is available on Amazon, apparently."
39:16;39:18;"There's a real Doritos subculture."
39:18;39:21;"So there's just some dudes just Amazon priming"
39:21;39:25;"Doritos peking duck by the case."
39:25;39:27;"I want that."
39:27;39:29;"I'm reading the review now of Doritos roulette,"
39:29;39:31;"and it just sounds--"
39:31;39:33;"[laughter]"
39:33;39:34;"All right, but Jake--"
39:34;39:35;"Very intriguing."
39:35;39:37;"We're talking about the positive side of Doritos."
39:37;39:39;"I just want to know, has Doritos or PepsiCo"
39:39;39:42;"ever apologized for getting mixed up"
39:42;39:44;"in the horrendous things?"
39:44;39:46;"I didn't see any reference to that."
39:46;39:48;"I mean, that would be surprising if they did."
39:48;39:50;"I feel like those kind of stories,"
39:50;39:52;"people just kind of, like, scoff at."
39:52;39:54;"Yeah, people probably don't even really believe it."
39:54;39:57;"Okay, dude, that PepsiCo CEO is on the Watergate tapes."
39:57;39:58;"Oh, my God."
39:58;40:00;"He's, like, hanging with Nixon in the White House."
40:00;40:02;"This truly went all the way to the very top."
40:02;40:06;"Jake, thank you so much for your in-depth reporting,"
40:06;40:08;"and I just want to say to everybody out there,"
40:08;40:10;"we've been talking about some pretty exciting flavors"
40:10;40:12;"of Doritos on the show today,"
40:12;40:14;"but I want you to go read about these things"
40:14;40:16;"that Jake's talking about,"
40:16;40:18;"because I want you to think about it."
40:18;40:20;"Your consumer choices do make an impact,"
40:20;40:21;"you know what I'm saying?"
40:21;40:22;"Real."
40:22;40:24;"Anyway, Jake, I'll see you in two weeks,"
40:24;40:26;"and I want to take this discussion even further,"
40:26;40:27;"if it's possible."
40:27;40:29;"Would love to."
40:29;40:31;"All right, man, see you back in California."
40:31;40:32;"Bye, Jake."
40:32;40:33;"Bye, Jake."

44:26;44:28;"My favorite..."
44:28;44:30;"My favorite thing about Katy Perry is when she's..."
44:30;44:32;"Yeah."
44:32;44:34;"I don't really know anything else about her."
44:34;44:36;"And she has great songs."
44:36;44:38;"I don't know."
44:38;44:40;"I've always been a Katy Perry fan."
44:40;44:42;"She's, uh, that ""Fireworks"" song? Is that her?"
44:42;44:44;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
44:44;44:46;"I don't know that one."
44:46;44:48;"That one's by Katy Perry."
44:48;44:50;"That's cool, man."
44:50;44:52;"Thank you."
44:52;44:54;"Speaking of cool, it's summer."
44:54;44:56;"It's the first day of summer, actually,"
44:56;44:58;"so, you know, everybody's gonna be trying to keep cool."
44:58;45:00;"And besides trying to keep cool,"
45:00;45:02;"maybe dipping in the pool, having a barbecue with your friends,"
45:02;45:05;"there's gonna be a lot of chatter about the song of the summer."
45:05;45:07;"So let's talk about summer songs."
45:07;45:09;"You know, it's funny."
45:09;45:11;"It's almost been a year since we first did ""Time Crisis."""
45:11;45:13;"We took a break, so..."
45:13;45:15;"It's crazy."
45:15;45:17;"We were always listening to the top five,"
45:17;45:19;"so we were always listening to the last year's song of the summer."
45:19;45:21;"Oh, God."
45:21;45:23;"Now, I think-- I'm pretty sure we crowned this unanimously"
45:23;45:25;"the song of the summer last year."
45:25;45:27;"And I also want to point out that people listening at home"
45:27;45:29;"might find this very painful"
45:29;45:31;"because one year after a summer"
45:31;45:33;"is literally, like, the worst time"
45:33;45:35;"to hear the big songs from that summer."
45:35;45:37;"That's true."
45:37;45:39;"It really can cause people pain,"
45:39;45:41;"so I'm about to play a song that might make you feel very weird"
45:41;45:43;"'cause you heard it so much about a year ago."
45:43;45:45;"You're gonna love it."
45:45;45:48;"In 20 years, your kids are gonna be playing it again, maybe."
45:48;45:50;"But right now, it's gonna make you feel--"
45:50;45:52;"you know, like sometimes when you're on a swing,"
45:52;45:54;"you get that kind of weird feeling?"
45:54;45:56;"Like, ""Maybe I took this too far."""
45:56;45:58;"Yeah, yeah."
45:58;46:00;"So here's one of the big songs of last summer."
46:00;46:02;"( music playing )"

52:37;52:39;"and going swimming."
52:39;52:42;"That was very popular summer 2007."
52:42;52:43;"It's kind of similar."
52:43;52:46;"This is-- yeah, it's like a little reggaeton."
52:46;52:47;"It's tropical."
52:47;52:49;"People call this UK funky."
52:49;52:50;"[laughs]"
52:50;52:52;"But was this ever a hit, this song?"

54:22;54:23;"Denton, Texas."
54:23;54:27;"We played a show for, I think, literally seven people."
54:27;54:29;"But then we got to LA."
54:29;54:30;"The shows in LA were full."
54:30;54:33;"I remember the big news for us then"
54:33;54:36;"was that Fred Armisen came to our first show in LA."
54:36;54:38;"Was he already on SNL at that point?"
54:38;54:39;"Yeah, he was on SNL."
54:39;54:40;"It was very exciting for us."

54:48;54:49;"It definitely wasn't this."
54:49;54:50;"No, it wasn't."
54:50;54:52;"And you-- can you ask Siri that now?"
54:52;54:54;"Let me look it up."
54:54;54:57;"Song of the summer 2007 was the song"
54:57;55:00;"that really broke one of our most important artists"

55:04;55:05;"Yeah, it was a good one."
55:05;55:07;"That song was number one in the UK for the whole year."
55:07;55:10;"And apparently it rained a lot while it was number one."

59:24;59:28;"- Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
59:28;59:31;"Beats one."
59:31;59:35;"- That was Rihanna with Umbrella featuring Jay-Z,"
59:35;59:38;"noted Los Angeles resident, Jay-Z."
59:38;59:42;"We are now joined in the studio by a New York resident,"
59:42;59:44;"Kai Rubenstein, AKA Mr. Mort."
59:44;59:46;"Did I pronounce your name correctly?"
59:46;59:47;"- Yes, sir."
59:47;59:49;"- We're very honored to have you join us here."
59:49;59:52;"You're a friend of both mine and Despot's."
59:52;59:56;"To people who maybe don't know what you do or who you are,"
59:56;59:57;"describe yourself."
59:57;59:59;"- I am just a chassid."
59:59;01:00:01;"I follow well-heeled men around the world,"
01:00:01;01:00:04;"wherever I am, trying to document"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"how they wear their clothes,"
01:00:06;01:00:10;"how they smile and approach life."
01:00:10;01:00:13;"I try to make people happy through their clothes."
01:00:13;01:00:14;"- You work in fashion."
01:00:14;01:00:20;"You document fashion on Snapchat, on Vine, on Instagram."
01:00:20;01:00:21;"Over the years, where have you worked?"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"Levi's, Marc Jacobs?"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"- Dockers."
01:00:25;01:00:25;"- Dockers?"
01:00:25;01:00:26;"- Yeah, I work at-- - I love Dockers."
01:00:26;01:00:29;"- Khaki's, double pleated."
01:00:29;01:00:33;"- I mentioned Dockers in my single that came out last summer"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"and I felt weird about it 'cause I don't--"
01:00:35;01:00:36;"- Are Dockers cool?"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"- Nah, I don't really wear Dockers."
01:00:38;01:00:42;"- The skinny Dockers would be baggy on Despot."
01:00:42;01:00:43;"- Yeah, I can't really wear that."
01:00:43;01:00:44;"- Despot's diesel now, maybe not."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"- I mean, yeah, my legs got bigger."
01:00:46;01:00:49;"- So, Mordecai, can we talk about your background?"
01:00:49;01:00:50;"It's interesting."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"- Sure, I spent some time at Men's Vogue."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"Let's not skip Condé Nast."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"- Oh, I didn't know about that."
01:00:54;01:00:55;"But I'm saying-- - No big deal."
01:00:55;01:00:56;"- Even before that--"
01:00:56;01:00:57;"- I studied to become a rabbi."
01:00:57;01:01:01;"- Yeah, so even before that, you come from the Hasidic community."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"- Yep, yeshiva.com."
01:01:03;01:01:06;"- So, that's not a normal transition,"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"is growing up in the Hasidic community"
01:01:08;01:01:10;"and then working at Men's Vogue?"
01:01:10;01:01:10;"- Nope."
01:01:10;01:01:11;"- How many people have done that?"
01:01:11;01:01:14;"At tops, 20, 30?"
01:01:14;01:01:15;"Maybe only one."
01:01:15;01:01:16;"- It gotta be."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"- So, what kind of clothes did you wear"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"growing up in the Hasidic community?"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"- Yamakas, tzitzis."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"- What's a tzitzis for the people--"
01:01:23;01:01:26;"- Oh, the fringes, the strings that come out of the side of the man's pants."
01:01:26;01:01:30;"- At what age do Hasidic boys start wearing black suits?"
01:01:30;01:01:30;"- Three."
01:01:30;01:01:34;"As soon as they have the upshirin, they cut the boy's hair,"
01:01:34;01:01:35;"that's it, suit."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"- So, did you have the payas?"
01:01:37;01:01:38;"- The payas, yep, yep."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"They tend to grow the payas into the beard."
01:01:40;01:01:43;"I didn't get into a bunch of different yeshivas"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"'cause they were like, ""You wax, you trim, you shave."""
01:01:45;01:01:48;"I was like, ""No, I haven't reached proper bar mitzvah puberty,"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"and I don't have the facial hair yet."""
01:01:50;01:01:53;"So, the yeshivas wouldn't accept me, some of them."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"You know, you start putting on the black hat,"
01:01:55;01:01:58;"fedora, at your bar mitzvah at 13,"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"and then at like 17, 18, you start questioning,"
01:02:00;01:02:03;"""Why am I looking like a young rabbi"
01:02:03;01:02:06;"when I don't have any hair on my face?"""
01:02:06;01:02:06;"- Yeah."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"- So, you take the hat off for a second,"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"and then you start questioning rabbis, this and that."
01:02:10;01:02:11;"I didn't question anything."
01:02:11;01:02:15;"I just put it down, and I wanted to dress like my age."
01:02:15;01:02:18;"Now, I'm about ready to put a fedora back on."
01:02:18;01:02:21;"But I skipped part of rabbinical school,"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"went to FIT for a little bit."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"- Okay, so that was the big transitional moment."
01:02:25;01:02:27;"Instead of going to rabbinical school, you went to FIT."
01:02:27;01:02:30;"- Yeah, became a half a rabbi and a half a fashion designer."
01:02:30;01:02:33;"- So, when you were going to FIT, were you dressing like a hasid?"
01:02:33;01:02:35;"- I had my yarmulke in my pocket,"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"like a pocket square of my blazer probably, but--"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"- Were you wearing all black?"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"- No, no, I wore some colors."
01:02:41;01:02:42;"- Because I know a lot of people,"
01:02:42;01:02:45;"maybe outside of New York or LA"
01:02:45;01:02:46;"or the vast majority of the world,"
01:02:46;01:02:50;"are not familiar with hasidic styles."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"People get confused sometimes, 'cause there's--"
01:02:52;01:02:55;"First of all, there's a lot of different types of hasids."
01:02:55;01:02:55;"- Oh, yeah."
01:02:55;01:02:56;"- You have different--"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"And the headwear is very different,"
01:02:58;01:03:01;"'cause in Williamsburg, the--"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"Is it the satmar who wear the kind of fur donut?"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"- Yep."
01:03:04;01:03:07;"But before that, like, young satmar boy"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"wearing like little pillbox velvet hat"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"with a little brim, so royal."
01:03:11;01:03:14;"Lubavitch, how I grew up, different sect of hasidim,"
01:03:14;01:03:16;"you don't wear a hat until you're 13."
01:03:16;01:03:18;"You just wear a yarmulke, so we didn't have that."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"But like--"
01:03:19;01:03:21;"- So, when you get your first hat at your bar mitzvah?"
01:03:21;01:03:22;"- 12 and 9 months."
01:03:22;01:03:23;"Three months before the bar mitzvah,"
01:03:23;01:03:24;"you start putting on tefillin,"
01:03:24;01:03:27;"and you play as if you're a bar mitzvah boy."
01:03:27;01:03:28;"It's all practice."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"You don't make the blessing,"
01:03:29;01:03:32;"but you just put the clothes on and the tefillin."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"But the clothes are amazing."
01:03:34;01:03:36;"In Lubavitch, you just put on the long,"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"double-breasted silk."
01:03:38;01:03:42;"It's almost like a Prince Albert when you're married."
01:03:42;01:03:45;"But in the satmar in the Williamsburg sects,"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"you start wearing that at 13,"
01:03:47;01:03:50;"and you put the fur on only when you're married."
01:03:50;01:03:50;"- Interesting."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"- Yeah."
01:03:51;01:03:51;"- You know what, man?"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"I'm gonna stop you right there."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"Let's listen to some tunes."

01:06:14;01:06:15;"So I got a question. Forgive my ignorance,"
01:06:15;01:06:19;"because I'm descended from a secular Upper West Side"
01:06:19;01:06:23;"Jews, but sometimes you see a the Hasidic guy wearing"
01:06:23;01:06:26;"what almost looks like a kimono. I mean if it's open on a"
01:06:26;01:06:29;"Saturday afternoon hands in the waistband, you know,"
01:06:29;01:06:32;"kind of just had lunch. I could see that but it's silk."
01:06:32;01:06:34;"It's like a silk or like a bathrobe."
01:06:34;01:06:38;"You mean the jacquard? How it's like silk floral tonal."
01:06:38;01:06:41;"Is that just for like the boss? No, it's really for every"
01:06:41;01:06:45;"married man. They put on a tishbek, a special for eating."
01:06:45;01:06:48;"It's almost like a bib. I almost think that the florals"
01:06:48;01:06:51;"like camouflage for food stains, but it's not. It's really"
01:06:51;01:06:55;"it's just some royal royal royal. So I got a question."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"There's other religions that have very specific rules about"
01:06:57;01:07:00;"how to dress obviously in the Sikh community."
01:07:00;01:07:03;"There's very specific look. But do you think that growing"
01:07:03;01:07:08;"up in a religious community that valued clothes so much"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"actually rather than holding you back got you interested"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"in fashion? Is there a connection there? Wow, amazing"
01:07:12;01:07:15;"question because people ask me, ""Oh, so what got you into"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"fashion?"" I'm like, I don't know. I have two older sisters."
01:07:17;01:07:20;"Girls are supposed to be into fashion. They got me into"
01:07:20;01:07:23;"it. They ended up wearing my sweaters and you're right."
01:07:23;01:07:27;"It was like wearing a suit at 12 and 13 and 14 and 15 and"
01:07:27;01:07:30;"16. Being in high school and getting your shirt starched"
01:07:30;01:07:33;"for the Sabbath and guys giving you nipple twisters or"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"twisters, whatever they're called, on a freshly starched shirt."
01:07:35;01:07:37;"It's like, oh my God, I spent $2.50 to get this shirt"
01:07:37;01:07:40;"starched. That's what you do. Starch ruins the shirt,"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"long story short, but also makes you look cool in high"
01:07:42;01:07:45;"school. But yeah, that's what got me into it. And on"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"the Sabbath when you're wearing your suit because during"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"the week you just wear like black backers, you know, black"
01:07:49;01:07:52;"pants, whatever. We only wore black and white, but you"
01:07:52;01:07:55;"folded on the nice crease to keep it for Saturday morning"
01:07:55;01:07:57;"to go to synagogue. It's almost like being in the military."
01:07:57;01:08:00;"You got to have your uniform looking fresh because"
01:08:00;01:08:03;"like when I was 13, maybe, I don't know, maybe my mom"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"took me to Old Navy or something, but I certainly was"
01:08:05;01:08:08;"not presented with a, you know, like a nice hat. You didn't"
01:08:08;01:08:11;"have any sharp creases. No, no, no, nobody was. Or hats."
01:08:11;01:08:14;"Yeah, my school had no uniforms or anything. You had"
01:08:14;01:08:17;"barber jackets, though. We didn't have that. My dad"
01:08:17;01:08:19;"had an old barber jacket. I got interested in that when"
01:08:19;01:08:22;"I was about 18 years old. But again, it wasn't official."
01:08:22;01:08:26;"There wasn't that kind of official style. We were talking"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"about this last night or two nights ago on the radio"
01:08:28;01:08:31;"show about how like the Sikhs and then the monks, I"
01:08:31;01:08:35;"guess they folded a certain way the robe and the"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"ascetic isn't folded a certain way. You're actually"
01:08:37;01:08:39;"not allowed to put it on the creases on the Sabbath."
01:08:39;01:08:42;"You're supposed to just fold it over. But yeah, it's"
01:08:42;01:08:45;"that pride in the uniform, right? Not necessarily."
01:08:45;01:08:48;"The talus, the prayer shawl with the strings, not just"
01:08:48;01:08:51;"the tzitzis with the prayer shawl that every boy wears"
01:08:51;01:08:54;"from three, but the talus with the big, big, big shawl"
01:08:54;01:08:57;"that they wear over the clothes only on the Sabbath"
01:08:57;01:08:59;"and in the mornings. That has to be folded a certain"
01:08:59;01:09:03;"way, which is so weird. I actually, since it's like"
01:09:03;01:09:06;"folding an American flag. Exactly. It really is like"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"being an ascetic is like being in the military. It"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"really is. It's a little looser than, I wouldn't"
01:09:10;01:09:13;"know. I haven't been in the military, but yeah, I"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"would imagine it's a little looser. You're in school"
01:09:15;01:09:19;"with all boys. You got to dress a certain way, uniform."
01:09:19;01:09:21;"So now, you know, it's interesting to me is that"
01:09:21;01:09:25;"as a, how to describe as a photographer, a social"
01:09:25;01:09:28;"media expert, you also still are very interested"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"in uniforms. Glad you said that, because I'm not"
01:09:30;01:09:34;"professional. I'm not getting paid. I love uniforms,"
01:09:34;01:09:35;"but it's interesting that you say that because"
01:09:35;01:09:39;"Mordecai is one of his main hashtags that you use"
01:09:39;01:09:42;"on social media is #beautyineverydayuniform."
01:09:42;01:09:44;"And that's one thing that I love about your approach"
01:09:44;01:09:47;"to style is that, you know, we can see high fashion"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"everywhere and I admire high fashion. This is no"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"diss, but there aren't that many people who are"
01:09:51;01:09:53;"looking at kind of the beauty of, say, the way"
01:09:53;01:09:57;"that a New York City employee, like an MTA person"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"maybe embellishes their uniform. And that's something"
01:09:59;01:10:01;"that you really have an eye for. I think there's"
01:10:01;01:10:04;"uniform like, you know, UPS, FedEx. Sure, FedEx,"
01:10:04;01:10:07;"a girl, guy, you know, delivering during the"
01:10:07;01:10:10;"holidays might put reindeer antlers on their head,"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"but they're still in uniform. But I also think"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"there's this Upper East Side guy wearing Chino,"
01:10:14;01:10:16;"seersucker, navy blazer. That's his everyday"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"uniform, acidic, jewel, black and white, not"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"thinking when you wake up in the morning, going"
01:10:20;01:10:22;"with it. These Upper East Side dudes that I'm"
01:10:22;01:10:23;"obsessed with, they've been wearing the same"
01:10:23;01:10:26;"J. Press Brooks Brothers bullsh*t for the same 30,"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"40 years. The acidic people, black and white."
01:10:28;01:10:30;"So I consider both uniform and I like finding"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"beauty in the everyday, but it's like you find"
01:10:32;01:10:35;"your door guy or your MTA guy, as soon as he"
01:10:35;01:10:38;"gets off work, you might clip the clip on tight"
01:10:38;01:10:41;"to the edge of the collar. Cool. He might never"
01:10:41;01:10:44;"put it on. I see bus drivers with paper towels"
01:10:44;01:10:47;"with binder clips around the shirt not to get"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"ring around the collar. That's beautiful. He's"
01:10:49;01:10:52;"keeping the shirt nice and crisp and he's taking"
01:10:52;01:10:55;"his uniform and making it his own, which is rare."
01:10:55;01:10:58;"Which is also important in a world where sometimes"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"our choices are limited. It's nice. You can't modify"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"in the army or in the Orthodox Jewish world."
01:11:02;01:11:04;"You can't really modify too much. Now they're"
01:11:04;01:11:05;"making their suits a little more fitted. They"
01:11:05;01:11:08;"might put a red eyelet and a stitching of the"
01:11:08;01:11:11;"lapel buttonhole, which is not kosher per se."
01:11:11;01:11:14;"It's supposed to be the way it is. But you know,"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"when they came over here from Eastern Europe,"
01:11:16;01:11:19;"all over the Russia, whatever, some wore the"
01:11:19;01:11:22;"casquette and some wore fur and only when"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"they came to America, they switched to a fedora"
01:11:24;01:11:26;"lababitch. So they did Americanize a little bit."
01:11:26;01:11:29;"So it does change. But it hasn't been the same"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"style forever. It hasn't, no. Let's put a pin in"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"that, play some music."
01:13:56;01:14:00;"So today is the first day of summer. We've"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"been talking about summer music, potential"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"songs of the summer, songs of the summer in"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"your past. Let's talk a little bit about men's"
01:14:06;01:14:09;"summer style. Oh yes. So first of all, in New"
01:14:09;01:14:12;"York these days, because of global warming or"
01:14:12;01:14:15;"whatever, the weather's all over the place. So"
01:14:15;01:14:17;"some of the rules go out the window. But let's"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"kind of keep it to more traditional summer"
01:14:19;01:14:22;"style. What are things that you absolutely"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"hate in modern men's summer style these days?"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"So Easter, from what I've learned from going"
01:14:26;01:14:29;"to the parade and watching the men, they can"
01:14:29;01:14:31;"pull out straw, pull out seersucker, pull out"
01:14:31;01:14:34;"pastels because it's Easter. Fine. Fine. But"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"if there's snow on the ground, you're an"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"idiot. What are you doing in linens? It's"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"freezing outside. Showing your ankles? I"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"don't care if you're a rock star on stage or"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"if you're walking to work on Wall Street."
01:14:44;01:14:46;"What are you showing your ankles for? It's"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"freezing. That's been happening all winter. Now"
01:14:48;01:14:51;"it's summer. So you hate when a man shows his"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"ankle in winter? When I'm cold. When I'm cold."
01:14:53;01:14:55;"If it's nice out, global warming, swarming,"
01:14:55;01:14:58;"whatever, fine. It's the impracticality of it."
01:14:58;01:15:00;"Yeah. I'm saying, you want to show your"
01:15:00;01:15:03;"ankles, I'm freezing. I know. When I was in"
01:15:03;01:15:06;"college, I'd never wear socks. And I got very"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"sick. I learned my lesson. I was going to say"
01:15:08;01:15:10;"you have thicker skin than I do. No, no, no."
01:15:10;01:15:12;"I'm a very cold person. Yeah. I love a scarf,"
01:15:12;01:15:15;"silk for this time of the year. But so let's"
01:15:15;01:15:17;"say it's a warm out. It's summertime and we've"
01:15:17;01:15:20;"got a traditional, an old fashioned warm summer."
01:15:20;01:15:24;"Then the socks are off. And that's okay?"
01:15:24;01:15:28;"In the big city? I don't wear boat shoes. I"
01:15:28;01:15:31;"wear socks. I cover my legs. There's rules for"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"a reason. So you never wear shorts? I mean,"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"off air, off the cuff, I do. You spend a lot of"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"time in Italy, as anybody who works in men's"
01:15:37;01:15:40;"fashion does. I remember once when I was in"
01:15:40;01:15:44;"what? Is that not true? It's semi-true. Let me"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"see your passport. For business, you go to"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"Pitti Uomo and you look around at the parade"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"of fashion people. I'm not trying to say that"
01:15:50;01:15:53;"you're a fancy guy. I spend time in New York."
01:15:53;01:15:54;"I know. I'm not trying to say that you're a"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"fancy guy. He's a trader. So he's trying to"
01:15:56;01:16:00;"bait you. He ditches New York. Okay. First of"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"all, LA, it all goes out the window. We're"
01:16:02;01:16:05;"flip-flops all year. Okay. But we're talking"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"New York summertime. Gentlemen, can we focus"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"the conversation? What about the boot? Gentlemen,"
01:16:09;01:16:11;"you don't have a collar on. Gentlemen, neither"
01:16:11;01:16:14;"do I. I'm the host of the show. Fine. I'm"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"allowed to say gentlemen. You're wearing a"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"jacket. He's wearing trousers. I remember when"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"I was in high school. These are 80s Versace,"
01:16:20;01:16:23;"by the way. They look like chef pants a little."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"No, no, no. The houndstooth is much finer."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"Yeah. Of course. They're nice. I like them."
01:16:27;01:16:30;"Actually, these were, again, these 80s Versace"
01:16:30;01:16:34;"pants. And a few weeks ago in LA, I had this"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"really nice white linen shirt. And it was"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"""This is a nice day."" And I threw on the white"
01:16:38;01:16:41;"linen shirt that had a shawl collar, white"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"linen shirt with these pants and my white"
01:16:43;01:16:44;"shoes. And I was feeling really good about"
01:16:44;01:16:46;"myself. Felt so light and fresh. Then I caught"
01:16:46;01:16:49;"a glimpse of myself in a shiny building. And"
01:16:49;01:16:52;"I said, ""All I'm missing is the crocs."" I look"
01:16:52;01:16:55;"like a chef who wandered out of the kitchen."
01:16:55;01:16:58;"I mean, if musicians started sizing up, not"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"you, musicians started sizing up, they'd be"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"doing a real big service for the music"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"industry. What do you mean, sizing up? Their"
01:17:04;01:17:07;"pants are too tight. Oh, they're too tight."
01:17:07;01:17:11;"Yes. Not you. Well, not today. I've worn some"
01:17:11;01:17:13;"tight pants. Are tight pants not cool anymore?"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"How you gonna strum a guitar, run around on"
01:17:15;01:17:18;"stage, jump, dance, crowd surf without your"
01:17:18;01:17:19;"pants? So, you saw what happened to Lenny"
01:17:19;01:17:22;"Kravis? Oh, yeah. Yeah, be careful. What's he"
01:17:22;01:17:26;"doing? His junk popped out. His pants split in"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"half. That was not a good look. Did a little"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"crouch? You know, I have opinions on what men"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"should and shouldn't wear, seasonal, where"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"you are, sure, time of the year and"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"everything. But I just want men to dress"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"like men. So, Mordechai, thank you so much."
01:17:38;01:17:41;"For everybody who's curious about you, who"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"wasn't familiar with you before, what's"
01:17:43;01:17:45;"your social media of choice? If these"
01:17:45;01:17:47;"people want to check out, see you going"
01:17:47;01:17:49;"around New York City, talking about style,"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"what do you like? Where should they follow"
01:17:51;01:17:53;"you? I'm loving Snapchat right now. It's"
01:17:53;01:17:55;"Mr. Mordechai. I lost my password for Mr."
01:17:55;01:17:59;"Mord, but it's M-I-S-T-E-R-M-O-R-D-E-C-H-A-I"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"or Mr. Mord on Instagram. Mr. Mord on"
01:18:01;01:18:03;"Instagram, Mr. Mordechai. How's my"
01:18:03;01:18:06;"pronunciation? I like the C-H. That's right."
01:18:06;01:18:08;"No, it's perfect. Yeah, it's not over like"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"""chhh"". What does your family say? They say"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"""hi"", but it's funny, they call me Mordy,"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"you know. Right. Okay, so Mr. Mordechai,"
01:18:14;01:18:17;"that was that too much, Mr. Mordechai on"
01:18:17;01:18:20;"Snapchat. Check him out, learn a thing or"
01:18:20;01:18:23;"two about fashion. But remember, at the"
01:18:23;01:18:25;"end of the day, Mr. Mord, you like guys"
01:18:25;01:18:27;"who have fun. I especially love men with"
01:18:27;01:18:30;"makeup and dresses. Okay. No, no, that's"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"good to hear. All right. Because men's"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"wear is a shanda right now."
01:18:34;01:18:39;"There's a brand new dance, but I don't know its name."
01:18:39;01:18:48;"The people from bad homes do it again and again."
01:18:48;01:18:56;"It's big and it's bland, full of tension and fear."
01:19:01;01:19:05;"They do it over there, but we don't do it here."
01:19:05;01:19:14;"Fashion, turn to the left. Fashion, turn to the right."
01:19:14;01:19:17;"Ooh, fashion."
01:19:17;01:19:22;"We are the Goon Squad and we're coming to town."
01:19:22;01:19:23;"Beep beep."
01:19:23;01:19:28;"Beep beep."

01:19:49;01:19:51;"Dance with me, don't dance with me."
01:19:51;01:19:52;"No."
01:19:52;01:19:54;"Beep beep."
01:19:55;01:19:59;"There's a brand new talk, but it's not very clear."
01:19:59;01:20:08;"The people from good homes are talking this year."
01:20:08;01:20:15;"Fashion, it's loud and it's tasteless."
01:20:15;01:20:17;"I've not heard it before."
01:20:22;01:20:27;"You're shouting while you're dancing on the dance floor."
01:20:27;01:20:31;"Ooh, fashion."
01:20:31;01:20:36;"Fashion, turn to the left. Fashion, turn to the right."

01:24:57;01:25:00;"Well, that was quite a segment from Mordecai Rubenstein."
01:25:00;01:25:02;"- He's a good talker."
01:25:02;01:25:04;"- You know, I like when people have strong opinions"
01:25:04;01:25:05;"about clothing."
01:25:05;01:25:08;"- Yeah, I feel very insecure about my clothes now."
01:25:08;01:25:09;"- We should have."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"- We probably should have had him evaluate our outfits."
01:25:11;01:25:13;"- You know, we gotta have him back."
01:25:13;01:25:15;"Although as he was leaving,"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"he liked my outfit when he first walked in,"
01:25:17;01:25:18;"but then I stood up,"
01:25:18;01:25:20;"he saw I was wearing Common Project shoes,"
01:25:20;01:25:24;"which if people don't know are these white leather shoes,"
01:25:24;01:25:25;"and on the side there's a number."
01:25:25;01:25:26;"- They come in colors."
01:25:26;01:25:28;"- Well, the good ones are white."
01:25:28;01:25:32;"And he saw, oh, don't even try, don't even try that."
01:25:32;01:25:35;"The good Common Project shoes, they look better in white."
01:25:35;01:25:38;"And suddenly his esteem for my outfit"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"went down to zero basically."
01:25:40;01:25:41;"(laughing)"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"I might need to get some new shoes."
01:25:43;01:25:46;"But we gotta have him back to talk fashion."
01:25:46;01:25:47;"But in the meantime, I'm excited for this."
01:25:47;01:25:49;"I haven't done this with you guys in a while."
01:25:49;01:25:52;"This is a segment very dear to our hearts on Time Crisis."
01:25:52;01:25:53;"It's the top five."
01:25:53;01:25:56;"- It's time for the top five."
01:25:56;01:25:58;"Five on iTunes."
01:25:58;01:26:02;"- Okay, so we're back in the top five."
01:26:02;01:26:04;"These are the top five songs on iTunes."
01:26:04;01:26:08;"Number five is by somebody named Adam Wakefield."
01:26:08;01:26:09;"Do you guys know Adam Wakefield?"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"- No. - Nope."
01:26:11;01:26:13;"- That's probably because he's on The Voice."
01:26:13;01:26:15;"And his-- - Wait, he's a judge"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"on The Voice or he's a character?"
01:26:17;01:26:20;"- I'm assuming he's a char, aka a contestant."
01:26:20;01:26:21;"- A contestant, sorry. - It's real."
01:26:21;01:26:23;"- Okay. - And this is him doing"
01:26:23;01:26:24;"a song called ""I'm Sorry."""
01:26:24;01:26:25;"So this is his voice performance."
01:26:25;01:26:28;"It's number five in the iTunes store right now."
01:26:28;01:26:29;"- And he wrote this song."

01:27:08;01:27:11;"- Why would you wanna listen to this song?"
01:27:11;01:27:12;"- I mean, usually on The Voice,"

01:28:26;01:28:27;"Okay, obviously this guy can sing,"
01:28:27;01:28:30;"so it makes sense that he's a contestant on The Voice."
01:28:30;01:28:31;"What do you guys think of his performance?"
01:28:31;01:28:34;"Is that a voice you wanna hear more of in the culture?"
01:28:34;01:28:36;"- You think sorry's hot right now as a word?"
01:28:36;01:28:38;"You think with that, with Bieber, with Beyonce,"
01:28:38;01:28:41;"you think he's just jumping on the sorry train?"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"- If he wrote the song, I mean,"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"I think everybody's sorry now."
01:28:45;01:28:46;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
01:28:46;01:28:47;"- As they should be."
01:28:48;01:28:49;"- Maybe that's the theme for 2016."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"- 2016 is very sorry."
01:28:51;01:28:53;"- I think he owes me an apology."
01:28:55;01:28:56;"- Not Adam Wakefield fan?"
01:28:56;01:28:58;"- No, I wouldn't say so."
01:28:58;01:29:00;"- He's gonna write a second song apologizing"
01:29:00;01:29:00;"for the first song."
01:29:00;01:29:02;"- I could imagine, maybe we need Adam Wakefield,"
01:29:02;01:29:03;"Despatch, he could sing the hook."

01:29:08;01:29:11;"- Okay, number four song is Don't Let Me Down"
01:29:11;01:29:14;"by the Chainsmokers, featuring Deya."
01:29:14;01:29:16;"Oh, I've been hearing this song around a lot."
01:29:16;01:29:18;"- I'm excited 'cause I've never known"
01:29:18;01:29:21;"what this band sounds like, and I can't really picture it."
01:29:21;01:29:21;"- They're not a band."
01:29:21;01:29:23;"- Oh God. - They're not a band, Grandpa."
01:29:23;01:29:24;"- Oh God."
01:29:24;01:29:25;"- It's a bunch of DJs."
01:29:25;01:29:26;"- A bunch of DJs?"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"How many DJs do you need?"
01:29:28;01:29:29;"- Is it between two DJs? - Too many DJs."
01:29:29;01:29:30;"- Too many DJs."
01:29:30;01:29:34;"I like this 'cause they take that guitar texture"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"that me as a rock musician, I love, really speaks to me."
01:29:36;01:29:37;"- This is like the--"
01:29:37;01:29:39;"- And then they're kinda bringing some of that EDM flavor."
01:29:39;01:29:41;"- This is like that XX song."
01:29:41;01:29:43;"- Oh yeah, this is EDM XX."
01:29:43;01:29:47;"- Yeah, this is the XX."
01:29:47;01:29:48;"- Is this the song Rip Bite the XX?"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"- It's like that melody backwards."
01:29:50;01:29:53;"- Yeah, I'm not sure this is its own song."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"- Wait, hold on, I think the drop is coming."
01:29:56;01:29:57;"There's gotta be a drop, right?"
01:29:57;01:29:58;"- I'm excited about that."
01:29:58;01:30:01;"- I thought we were in post-drop."
01:30:01;01:30:02;"- Okay, here it comes."
01:30:02;01:30:03;"- Now you feel the-- - Here it comes."
01:30:03;01:30:05;"- Yeah, you thought this was a rock song."

01:30:14;01:30:15;"- This is a drop."

01:30:16;01:30:19;"- Drop."
01:30:20;01:30:23;"- I love it, it started like the XX"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"and then it became like--"
01:30:24;01:30:25;"- Skrillex."
01:30:25;01:30:26;"- Yeah, Skrillex X."
01:30:26;01:30:27;"- Early Skrillex."

01:31:01;01:31:07;"Don't let me down, down, down."
01:31:07;01:31:13;"Don't let me down, down, down."
01:31:16;01:31:18;"Don't let me down, down, down."
01:31:18;01:31:24;"Don't let me down. Don't let me down, down, down."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"Don't let me down."
01:31:27;01:31:31;"Alright, so, what do you guys think of that song?"
01:31:31;01:31:32;"Terrible."
01:31:32;01:31:35;"Honestly, it sounds like it's like 3, 4 years old."
01:31:35;01:31:41;"It sounds like that Katy Perry song, the Egypt one, where it's like, uh, Storm, something"
01:31:41;01:31:42;"Storm, Perfect Storm."
01:31:42;01:31:43;"Uh, Dark Horse."
01:31:43;01:31:44;"Dark Horse."
01:31:44;01:31:45;"The one with Juicy J on it."
01:31:45;01:31:46;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:31:47;01:31:48;"That does sound like that."
01:31:48;01:31:49;"That was a good song."
01:31:49;01:31:50;"Wait, Alec, why do you hate this song so much?"
01:31:50;01:31:51;"It sucks."
01:31:51;01:31:52;"What?"
01:31:52;01:31:55;"Uh, I mean, it sounds like it's the XX."
01:31:55;01:32:02;"It's like a XX ripoff in the beginning, and then it's like, yeah, like early Skrillex,"
01:32:02;01:32:07;"early EDM, you know, whatever, Wobble Basie type, whatever, Dentist Drill."
01:32:07;01:32:09;"Uh, I don't like it."
01:32:09;01:32:14;"It sounds like an algorithm made it, like Watson made it, like just took like 4 different"
01:32:14;01:32:16;"genres that people like and just like put them in a row after each other."
01:32:16;01:32:21;"So you're saying that the Chainsmokers genius would only be equaled by say the smartest"
01:32:21;01:32:22;"computer in the world."
01:32:22;01:32:26;"Yeah, I think Watson should have a song in the top 5."
01:32:26;01:32:27;"Don't let me."
01:32:27;01:32:28;"You know what?"
01:32:28;01:32:29;"I'm going to choose to frame it positively."
01:32:29;01:32:31;"Of course you are."
01:32:31;01:32:38;"Because I think this song was a respectful nod to the XX and to Skrillexx."
01:32:38;01:32:43;"But do you think if that point was brought up to the Chainsmokers, they would say, you're"
01:32:43;01:32:44;"absolutely right."
01:32:44;01:32:47;"We love Skrillexx and the XX, and that's why we made this song."
01:32:47;01:32:48;"I don't think so."
01:32:48;01:32:49;"I think they might."
01:32:50;01:32:51;"I'm going to say no."
01:32:51;01:32:52;"I think it was obvious."
01:32:53;01:32:55;"The guys who had that song, ""First, let me take a selfie."""
01:32:55;01:32:56;"I don't know that."
01:32:56;01:32:57;"It was a big hit."
01:32:57;01:33:00;"The chorus went, ""First, let me take a selfie."""
01:33:00;01:33:04;"I think the Chainsmokers like to hold up a mirror to society."
01:33:04;01:33:05;"It's as simple as that."
01:33:05;01:33:08;"So selfie was obviously about kind of social media vanity."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"Selfie's kind of like a mirror in and of itself."
01:33:10;01:33:11;"It's literally a mirror."
01:33:11;01:33:13;"Wait, did they have the Kanye song too?"
01:33:13;01:33:14;"It was called Kanye."
01:33:15;01:33:18;"Because they were holding a mirror to society, basically being like, ""Kanye is a famous rapper."""
01:33:18;01:33:20;"Maybe that's why I don't like it."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"They're exposing me and I'm ashamed."
01:33:22;01:33:23;"You're taking a good hard look in the mirror."
01:33:23;01:33:24;"Maybe you don't like what you see."
01:33:24;01:33:25;"Yeah, you might be right."
01:33:25;01:33:31;"The number three song on iTunes right now is Florida Georgia Line, who I absolutely love."
01:33:31;01:33:33;"I was defending this to Jake in LA."
01:33:33;01:33:35;"I don't know what any of this is."
01:33:35;01:33:36;"You never heard of Florida Georgia Line?"
01:33:36;01:33:40;"Country is making a crazy play for the top five right now."
01:33:40;01:33:41;"This is going to rap."
01:33:41;01:33:42;"Some people call these guys bro country."
01:33:42;01:33:46;"Alec, if you didn't grow up in Queens and you grew up, let's say, around the border"
01:33:46;01:33:49;"of Florida and Georgia, this is what your music would probably sound like."
01:33:49;01:33:52;"Are you calling me a bro?"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"I'm saying you're a tough guy."
01:33:54;01:33:55;"Thanks."
01:33:55;01:33:57;"But in Queens, being a tough guy is one thing."
01:33:57;01:34:04;"In Florida Georgia Line, it sounds a little something like this."
01:34:04;01:34:11;"I'm so good at radio."
01:34:11;01:34:16;"Despot as a lyricist, you're going to love the wordplay because this song is called ""Holy,"""
01:34:16;01:34:19;"and it's H dot O dot L dot Y."
01:34:19;01:34:21;"Can you tell me what that acronym is?"
01:34:21;01:34:22;"Means?"
01:34:22;01:34:23;"Oh, I could do you one better."
01:34:23;01:34:27;"I could let Florida Georgia Line sing it."
01:34:27;01:34:30;"This is the pre-chorus."
01:34:30;01:34:36;"What do you think holy stands for?"
01:34:36;01:34:37;"How often?"
01:34:37;01:34:38;"I can't."
01:34:38;01:34:39;"Your time's running out guys."
01:34:39;01:34:40;"You're about to find out."
01:34:40;01:34:41;"Hello."
01:34:41;01:34:42;"Oh, what?"
01:34:42;01:34:49;"I'm loving you."
01:34:49;01:34:58;"I'm loving you."
01:34:58;01:35:18;"I'm loving you."
01:35:18;01:35:46;"I'm loving you."
01:35:46;01:36:10;"I'm loving you."
01:36:34;01:36:45;"What is the ""I""?"
01:36:45;01:36:46;"High on loving you."
01:36:46;01:36:47;"Oh, Jesus Christ."
01:36:47;01:36:50;"So, Despot, you're from Queens where some of the most famous rappers of all time from"
01:36:50;01:37:00;"your Nas to your Mobb Deeps to your Nicky Minaj."
01:37:00;01:37:01;"Yeah, Royal Flush."
01:37:01;01:37:03;"You got your Royal Flushes."
01:37:03;01:37:08;"So, you got a lot of very lyrical rappers coming out of Queens."
01:37:08;01:37:13;"So, for you having that kind of pedigree as a Queens rapper, you got to give it up."
01:37:13;01:37:15;"Holy, holy, high on loving you."
01:37:15;01:37:16;"It's very clever."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"Yeah."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"That's great."
01:37:18;01:37:24;"Now, speaking of rap, the number two song is by a rapper from Canada."
01:37:24;01:37:26;"You know who I'm talking about."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"Yeah."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"Do you?"
01:37:28;01:37:29;"Of course."
01:37:29;01:37:30;"There's only one rapper from Canada."
01:37:30;01:37:31;"It's Drake."
01:37:31;01:37:34;"Some people say this might be the song of the summer."
01:37:34;01:37:35;"I would agree."
01:37:35;01:37:41;"This was his, oh, actually, this was his first number one ever after like 100."
01:37:41;01:37:43;"Congratulations to Drake on your first number one."
01:37:43;01:37:45;"I love this song."
01:37:45;01:37:46;"You do?"
01:37:46;01:37:47;"Yeah."
01:37:47;01:37:52;"You could really do some serious hip gyrations to this."
01:37:52;01:37:54;"And I'm good at that."
01:38:57;01:38:59;"All right, we already listened to this song."
01:38:59;01:39:02;"Shout out to Drake, but also shout out to Wizkid and Kyla."
01:39:02;01:39:03;"Yeah."
01:39:03;01:39:04;"Paleface."
01:39:04;01:39:05;"Don't forget about Paleface."
01:39:05;01:39:09;"He kind of got lost in the shuffle over the years, over the past decade."
01:39:09;01:39:13;"The number one song on iTunes right now is by a guy."
01:39:13;01:39:14;"Cheerleader."
01:39:14;01:39:15;"Yeah."
01:39:15;01:39:17;"It's Omi Cheerleader."
01:39:17;01:39:21;"The number one song is by a guy who's been quiet for the past couple years."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"His name is Justin Timberlake."
01:39:22;01:39:24;"He used to be, you might remember, he was an Nsync."
01:39:24;01:39:26;"No, not familiar."
01:39:26;01:39:30;"He was an Nsync who were kind of like, they're like Backstreet Boys,"
01:39:30;01:39:32;"but they were looked to Europe a little more."
01:39:32;01:39:33;"They had a little more European flavor."
01:39:33;01:39:34;"Like a male Spice Girls."
01:39:34;01:39:35;"That sounds cool."
01:39:35;01:39:37;"They were more like a male Spice Girls."
01:39:37;01:39:40;"Nsync had a, what was it, a little classier?"
01:39:40;01:39:41;"Oh."
01:39:41;01:39:42;"You know, whatever."
01:39:42;01:39:43;"It's like, Nsync was--"
01:39:43;01:39:45;"More adult."
01:39:45;01:39:47;"Nsync was Banana Republic, Backstreet Boys were The Gap."
01:39:47;01:39:48;"Old Navy."
01:39:48;01:39:49;"Okay."
01:39:49;01:39:51;"Old Navy was the Nick Lachey one."
01:39:51;01:39:52;"Five."
01:39:52;01:39:53;"Old Navy was five."
01:39:53;01:39:54;"Old Navy was definitely five."
01:39:54;01:39:58;"But, you know, just like those three brands, they're all great and I love them all."
01:39:58;01:40:02;"But anyway, so Justin Timberlake, he's making a solo play right now."
01:40:02;01:40:04;"He did the boy band thing for a while."
01:40:04;01:40:05;"Now he's making a solo play."
01:40:05;01:40:06;"Good for him."
01:40:06;01:40:07;"So I think this might be--"
01:40:07;01:40:12;"But is this song, do you pull like a happy, like this song is from a children's movie,"
01:40:12;01:40:15;"and now it's a crossover, and now we're going to treat it like a real song?"
01:40:15;01:40:16;"We'll see if it's a crossover."
01:40:16;01:40:19;"It's from a movie called Trolls by DreamWorks Animation."
01:40:19;01:40:20;"Yes."
01:40:20;01:40:21;"That's crazy."
01:40:21;01:40:24;"I feel like they didn't even worry about the movie because they're like,"
01:40:24;01:40:27;"""If we can get JT to do a song, then we can make a movie about anything."
01:40:27;01:40:28;"It doesn't even matter."""
01:40:28;01:40:29;"I bet it's a good movie."
01:40:29;01:40:30;"I mean, I think it's important for--"
01:40:30;01:40:31;"No disrespect to Trolls."
01:40:31;01:40:32;"I haven't seen it."
01:40:32;01:40:35;"Well, I think it's also important for kids to learn about Trolls today because these"
01:40:35;01:40:36;"days, you got kids--"
01:40:36;01:40:37;"What, is it about internet trolls?"
01:40:37;01:40:38;"Yeah."
01:40:38;01:40:40;"Kids are getting on the internet."
01:40:40;01:40:41;"I'm serious."
01:40:41;01:40:42;"I read about this the other day."
01:40:42;01:40:46;"Kids are getting on the internet two years old today."
01:40:46;01:40:47;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:40:47;01:40:48;"How old are they trolling?"
01:40:48;01:40:49;"I read about this in the paper."
01:40:49;01:40:50;"This is true."
01:40:50;01:40:54;"A lot of parents give birth in the hospital."
01:40:54;01:40:57;"Back in the day, mom gives birth to you."
01:40:57;01:41:00;"They take you home maybe, maybe grandma and grandpa's house."
01:41:00;01:41:01;"Maybe."
01:41:01;01:41:04;"These days, the first stop is the Apple Store."
01:41:04;01:41:05;"That's true."
01:41:05;01:41:06;"What does that mean?"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Because you buy the baby an iPhone."
01:41:09;01:41:10;"iPad usually."
01:41:10;01:41:11;"Or an iPad."
01:41:11;01:41:12;"They love the iPad."
01:41:12;01:41:13;"Yeah, you buy the baby an iPad."
01:41:13;01:41:16;"Okay, first of all, at least order it and buy it ahead of time."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"That's what I'm saying."
01:41:17;01:41:18;"But how crazy is this?"
01:41:18;01:41:19;"It's just pretty practical about it."
01:41:19;01:41:21;"You're going home with a newborn baby."
01:41:21;01:41:24;"You're going to stop at the Apple Store to buy them an iPad?"
01:41:24;01:41:29;"So next thing you know, around two years old, baby gets on Snapchat."
01:41:29;01:41:35;"So basically what I'm saying is kids are on the internet from a very early age now."
01:41:35;01:41:38;"So I think it is important that they learn about trolls."
01:41:38;01:41:39;"Yeah."
01:41:39;01:41:40;"And Justin Timberlake clearly agrees."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"So this is his song, ""Can't Stop the Feeling."""
01:41:42;01:41:44;"All in caps lock for some reason."
01:41:44;01:41:46;"[laughs]"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"Maybe an accident."
01:41:50;01:41:52;"Listen to the way they compress that piano."
01:41:56;01:41:58;"I like that snaps instead of claps."
01:41:58;01:41:59;"Yeah."
01:41:59;01:42:01;"Makes it a little more sassy."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"Are those snaps layered with claps?"
01:42:05;01:42:06;"Maybe it's snaps and claps."
01:42:06;01:42:08;"[laughs]"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"Oh, I think this is funk."
01:42:15;01:42:16;"Is this number one?"
01:42:16;01:42:18;"This is literally just another half ape."
01:42:18;01:42:19;"This is just another half ape."
01:42:33;01:42:34;"This sucks."
01:42:34;01:42:35;"[laughs]"
01:42:35;01:42:36;"This really does suck."
01:42:36;01:42:37;"Excuse me."
01:42:37;01:42:38;"Wait, what did you say?"
01:42:38;01:42:39;"You said this bucks?"
01:42:39;01:42:40;"Yeah."
01:42:40;01:42:41;"Is that like it bumps?"
01:42:41;01:42:42;"Yeah, that's what I meant."
01:42:42;01:42:43;"This bucks, man."
01:42:43;01:42:46;"[laughs]"
01:42:46;01:42:48;"Wait, what song is this based on?"
01:42:48;01:42:50;"It sounded like ""American Boy"" for a second there."
01:42:50;01:42:51;"""Get Lucky."""
01:42:51;01:42:52;"It's got a little bit of ""American Boy."""
01:42:52;01:42:55;"It's a little bit of ""Get Lucky."""
01:42:55;01:42:58;"And obviously the whole thing sounds like ""Happy."""
01:45:37;01:45:39;"Reminds me of something."
01:45:39;01:45:42;"I guess great songs always remind you of something."
01:45:42;01:45:44;"[singing]"
01:45:44;01:45:45;"Yeah, it's fun."
01:45:45;01:45:46;"It's kind of a throwback."
01:45:46;01:45:47;"Makes you feel good."
01:45:47;01:45:48;"Sounds cynical to me."
01:45:48;01:45:49;"What?"
01:45:49;01:45:52;"It just seems like his heart's not in that."
01:45:52;01:45:55;"Well, look, to be fair, the whole concept of internet trolls,"
01:45:55;01:45:57;"they're inherently cynical."
01:45:57;01:46:00;"Okay, you think it's an ironic."
01:46:00;01:46:04;"See, I would suggest that all caps are almost ironic on their own."
01:46:04;01:46:05;"Oh, wait, I just realized."
01:46:05;01:46:08;"No, not only is it all caps, there's an exclamation point at the end."
01:46:08;01:46:09;"Can't stop the feeling."
01:46:09;01:46:12;"Exactly, that's what you would write in a YouTube comment."
01:46:12;01:46:13;"That's typical troll behavior."
01:46:13;01:46:18;"It's just an exciting song, and they're excited probably when they name the song."
01:46:18;01:46:19;"I can tell you one thing."
01:46:19;01:46:22;"I'm going to be playing this at one of my barbecues this summer."
01:46:22;01:46:23;"I hope so."
01:46:23;01:46:26;"You think this is the next cheerleader?"
01:46:26;01:46:27;"Okay, that's a good question."
01:46:27;01:46:30;"Which of these songs is the best of the five we heard?"
01:46:30;01:46:31;"""One Dance."""
01:46:31;01:46:32;"Yeah."
01:46:32;01:46:33;"""One Dance,"" yeah."
01:46:33;01:46:34;"""Hands Down."""
01:46:34;01:46:37;"I guess that's the cool choice."
01:46:37;01:46:38;"Yep, and we're cool."
01:46:38;01:46:40;"I mean, what would you say, Florida Georgia line?"
01:46:40;01:46:45;"Got a little hipster and a rapper over here today."
01:46:45;01:46:47;"Everybody wants to choose Drake."
01:46:47;01:46:49;"Okay, what's my choice?"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"Just a huge pale face, bro."
01:46:51;01:46:55;"My choice is Adam Wakefield, I'm sorry, because you know what?"
01:46:55;01:46:57;"All these other artists are more established,"
01:46:57;01:47:00;"and Adam Wakefield, he's competing to break into the music industry,"
01:47:00;01:47:01;"and I really respect that."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"It sounds like he did it."
01:47:02;01:47:05;"It sounds like he doesn't need Blake anymore."
01:47:05;01:47:06;"It sounds like he already did it."
01:47:06;01:47:08;"Yeah, he broke in."
01:47:08;01:47:10;"Well, that was the iTunes top five."
