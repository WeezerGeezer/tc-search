00:00;00:09;"Time Crisis, the day after my birthday. New year, new me. Today, Jake and I will be talking"
00:09;00:21;"about the Eagles, KFC in Indonesia, and of course, Pepsi and their controversial new commercial."
00:21;00:29;"We'll be joined by Deezus to take in the world around us. This is Time Crisis."
00:29;00:31;"With Ezra King."
00:31;00:35;"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:41;00:48;"The war I felt, warmingly, all my rightful chances."
00:48;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:55;01:02;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go."
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:13;01:17;"He's the lonely man."
01:17;01:22;"Time Crisis, Sunday, April 9th, 2017. What's up, Jake?"
01:22;01:24;"Hey, I just crushed a burrito."
01:24;01:25;"Yeah, me too."
01:25;01:26;"Woo!"
01:26;01:28;"You know, yesterday was my birthday."
01:28;01:30;"It was? April 8th?"
01:30;01:33;"Isn't that the day that Cobain died?"
01:33;01:37;"Yeah, well, I've always associated my birthday with the death of Kurt Cobain."
01:37;01:42;"He was the lead singer of Nirvana, for the listeners, but he didn't die on the 8th."
01:42;01:46;"But here's why I remember it. He died on, I believe, the 6th or the 5th."
01:46;01:47;"Okay."
01:47;01:49;"They found his body on the 8th."
01:49;01:50;"News broke."
01:50;01:51;"Yeah."
01:51;01:53;"For some reason, that was a huge Nirvana head."
01:53;01:54;"Yeah."
01:54;01:56;"Junior year of high school."
01:56;02:01;"And I remember just kind of marking that date in my memory. It was April 8th."
02:01;02:07;"That must have been the day they found the body, because the reason I remember it so well is because that was April 8th, 1994."
02:07;02:08;"Yep."
02:08;02:09;"So it was my 10th birthday."
02:09;02:10;"Wow, I was 17."
02:10;02:12;"You were 17."
02:12;02:14;"Learning to drive, or driving."
02:14;02:17;"I drove home that day. I got the news."
02:17;02:19;"And you were just like in history class?"
02:19;02:25;"Well, no, no, no. I got in my car, and they were playing Nirvana on every rock station."
02:25;02:29;"I had this fleeting thought. I was like, maybe Kurt Cobain killed himself."
02:29;02:32;"Maybe Chris Novoselic died in a car crash."
02:32;02:36;"That was my second thought. And it turned out, boom."
02:36;02:37;"Damn."
02:37;02:40;"So we would not have hung out in '94. That would have been a weird hang."
02:40;02:45;"Yeah, yeah, you might have babysat me."
02:45;02:48;"But then, did you cry?"
02:48;02:52;"No, I didn't cry. I was shocked and bummed. I was a huge Nirvana head."
02:52;02:55;"That's crazy. I can't remember. I've never experienced that."
02:55;02:58;"Somebody I was a huge fan of dying in their prime."
02:58;03:00;"Right, suddenly, violently."
03:00;03:03;"Of course, there are people I've been a fan of who've died."
03:03;03:06;"But, you know, and sometimes way too soon."
03:06;03:08;"But not like third album."
03:08;03:10;"Right, right."
03:10;03:12;"I remember it really well, because on my 10th birthday."
03:12;03:17;"You know when you're 10, maybe these days it's earlier, because you get an iPad when you're born."
03:17;03:22;"But back then, when you're 10, I think I was just starting middle school."
03:22;03:25;"And that's when a few kids start rolling to school."
03:25;03:29;"Maybe kids with older siblings start rolling to school in a Nine Inch Nails t-shirt."
03:29;03:33;"You know, it's like, there's some kids who are still like babies, basically."
03:33;03:36;"And then there's other kids who are like proto-teens."
03:36;03:37;"Right."
03:37;03:42;"So I remember hanging out, and my main music friend was this guy named Willie Roger."
03:42;03:43;"Good name."
03:43;03:46;"Yeah, he became Will later. Will Roger."
03:46;03:48;"Also a good name."
03:48;03:49;"He was really into heavy music."
03:49;03:53;"So even at 10, he was like, you know, just picture us being like 10 and 4th."
03:53;03:58;"I think maybe it was 4th grade, just being like, ""Hey Ezra, you ever heard of Helmet?"""
03:58;03:59;"[laughter]"
03:59;04:01;"Just be like, ""Uh, I don't think so."""
04:01;04:04;"But anyway, you know, I would listen to some rock radio."
04:04;04:06;"And I remember I liked Heart Shaped Box."
04:06;04:07;"Sure."
04:07;04:09;"Which was on the radio a lot of the time."
04:09;04:14;"Because I also remember in 4th grade, we had vocabulary lists every week to learn words."
04:14;04:17;"And one time, one of the words was ""debt."""
04:17;04:20;"You know, which when you're 10, not everybody understands that word."
04:20;04:23;"That's like, you know, it seems really basic to us now."
04:23;04:25;"But that's like a kind of tough concept."
04:25;04:26;"Sure."
04:26;04:28;"I remember my teacher was like, ""Does anybody know the word 'debt'?"""
04:28;04:33;"And I was like, ""Yes, it's in the Nirvana song, Heart Shaped Box, 'Forever'."""
04:33;04:35;"She was like, ""What's the context?"""
04:35;04:37;"And I was like, ""Uh, 'Forever' and 'Debt' is your priceless advice."""
04:37;04:39;"[laughter]"
04:39;04:41;"But anyway, I had some vague sense of Nirvana."
04:41;04:42;"And I was aware of Nirvana."
04:42;04:44;"Friends would talk about Nirvana."
04:44;04:46;"But I wasn't in yet."
04:46;04:48;"I definitely didn't know the name Kurt Cobain."
04:48;04:50;"It was a weekend, as I recall."
04:50;04:52;"A bunch of kids came over to the house."
04:52;04:59;"And Will Roger, his gift to me was the Nirvana album in utero on cassette."
04:59;05:00;"Sick."
05:00;05:01;"So I was like, ""Cool."""
05:01;05:06;"So in some ways, that was like my first real album I ever received."
05:06;05:07;"Really?"
05:07;05:09;"I think I had some CDs and tapes."
05:09;05:11;"Maybe I didn't even have CDs yet."
05:11;05:12;"But he gave it to me on tape."
05:12;05:13;"So I was like, ""Oh, that's cool."""
05:13;05:14;"And I was looking at it."
05:14;05:18;"And the cover is a model of a woman with a baby."
05:18;05:20;"And I was like, ""Whoa, this is crazy."""
05:20;05:22;"So I was like, ""That's cool."""
05:22;05:25;"And then I remember on the Monday coming to school,"
05:25;05:28;"and another kid who'd been at my birthday party named Ryan Ayres--"
05:28;05:30;"and he also had older siblings--"
05:30;05:32;"and I remember Ryan Ayres coming over and being like,"
05:32;05:35;"""Yo, the dude from that band is dead."""
05:35;05:36;"I was like, ""Which band?"""
05:36;05:38;"He's like, ""Nirvana, your tape."""
05:38;05:40;"And I was like, ""What?"""
05:40;05:45;"So basically, almost immediately after getting my first Nirvana album,"
05:45;05:47;"I find out this guy had died."
05:47;05:49;"But I didn't really know who he was, you know,"
05:49;05:51;"other than that it was the dude from Nirvana."

31:06;31:10;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
31:10;31:15;"So that's one classic brand KFC. One of the largest brands globally too."
31:15;31:16;"Yeah, huge."
31:16;31:19;"What's this Fox News Eagles thing? Can you break it down for me man?"
31:19;31:26;"I'll try. You're aware of this like Bill O'Reilly sexual harassment suit and settlement that's been happening."
31:26;31:31;"Oh yeah, notorious scumbag Bill O'Reilly getting accused yet again."
31:31;31:38;"According to a lawsuit filed on Monday, there's this guy Bill Shine, co-president of Fox News."
31:38;31:45;"In some deposition, there was a woman that worked for the company that was putting forth a testimony."
31:45;31:52;"And he asked her during the meeting if she had seen the Showtime documentary on the band the Eagles called The History of the Eagles."
31:52;31:54;"So this is like at work?"
31:54;31:56;"This is in like a formal deposition."
31:56;31:59;"This conversation happened in the deposition?"
31:59;32:03;"The suit filed by Julie Roganiski, a liberal commentator for Fox News,"
32:03;32:08;"says Bill Shine offered this insight during a meeting on November 29th,"
32:08;32:14;"at which Roganiski reported that she was harassed and punished for refusing to have sex with Roger Ailes."
32:14;32:16;"Okay, now I understand the context."
32:16;32:19;"There's a woman who works at Fox News, a liberal commentator,"
32:19;32:26;"and she's going to meet with a higher up to tell him that she's being harassed"
32:26;32:30;"because she refused to have sex with another guy at the company."
32:30;32:35;"And rather than this guy say, ""Well, that's horrendous. Let's go to HR, report this, blah, blah, blah."""
32:35;32:40;"Instead, he says to her, ""Have you seen the Showtime documentary on the band the Eagles?"""
32:40;32:44;"Because the story of the Eagles was very similar to the story of Fox News,"
32:44;32:51;"i.e., in the same way that such brilliant musicians as Glenn Frey, Linda Ronstadt, and Jackson Browne,"
32:51;32:54;"neither of whom are members of the Eagles,"
32:54;33:01;"could only have come together at one place in one time in history, the Troubadour, circa 1970."
33:01;33:07;"So it was with Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Suzanne Scott, Roger Ailes, and Bill Shine"
33:07;33:09;"coming together to form Fox News."
33:09;33:16;"So he's trying to draw an analogy that says Fox News, like the Southern California country rock scene"
33:16;33:22;"that emerged out of the Troubadour circa 1970 and culminated in the triumph of the Eagles,"
33:22;33:31;"like that meeting of the minds, Fox News formed in 1996 under the guidance of Roger Ailes, is similar."
33:31;33:34;"Great minds, Hannity, O'Reilly."
33:34;33:36;"And that's all that's in the article?"
33:36;33:37;"Essentially. It was an op-ed."
33:37;33:42;"They just kind of wanted to point out that this dumbass tried to compare himself to the Eagles."
33:42;33:46;"It's not really a news item. It's more of like a, ""This was..."""
33:46;33:47;"It's like an ad."
33:47;33:49;"""This happened, and this is hilarious, and we should..."""
33:49;33:53;"Right. See, what I want to know is... What's the woman's name again, Jane?"
33:53;33:55;"Julie Roganiski."
33:55;33:56;"So Ms. Roganiski..."
33:56;33:58;"I might be murdering that pronunciation."
33:58;34:03;"This woman... I would love to know what happened on either end of the conversation."
34:03;34:09;"Because I'm just kind of wondering if she's like, ""Mr. Shine, I'm being punished for not having sex with Roger Ailes."""
34:09;34:11;"To which this guy replies..."
34:11;34:13;"See, I'm wondering how this went down."
34:13;34:14;"You know how he..."
34:14;34:16;"He looks out the window, and he's like..."
34:16;34:19;"""I get a peaceful..."""
34:19;34:22;"He's like, ""Julie, have you ever seen the Eagles documentary?"""
34:22;34:24;"""Easy feeling..."""
34:24;34:26;"Yes, of course I've seen the Eagles documentary."
34:26;34:32;"I fail to understand what that has to do with the fact that I'm telling you I was sexually harassed, you psycho."
34:32;34:33;"But have you heard the long run?"
34:33;34:34;"And then the guy's like..."
34:34;34:39;"""Hold on, hold on. I'm making a point. Sean Hannity is our Linda Ronstadt."""
34:39;34:42;"So I wonder if he does this whole analogy, and she's like..."
34:42;34:47;"""Okay, man. You guys are the Eagles. The Eagles. I hate the Eagles."""
34:47;34:49;"""I was sexually harassed, you piece of sh-"""
34:49;34:53;"""I like the way sparkling earrings shine."""
34:53;34:54;"This is my guess."
34:54;34:56;"He's basically trying to say to her..."
34:56;35:03;"""You know, back in the crazy 70s, the Eagles were notorious party animals."""
35:03;35:05;"""Fox News is like that."""
35:05;35:06;"""We're party animals?"""
35:06;35:07;"""We're party animals."""
35:07;35:09;"""That's the price that you pay for my greatness."""
35:09;35:11;"Yeah, that's basically what he's trying to say to her."
35:11;35:15;"""I wanna sleep with you in the desert tonight."""
35:15;35:16;"God, what a nut."
35:16;35:17;"I feel terrible for this one."
35:17;35:19;"Imagine how nutty it is to work at Fox News, period."
35:19;35:20;"I know."
35:20;35:21;"Especially if you're the token liberal."
35:21;35:22;"Oh my God."
35:22;35:23;"And you're a woman."
35:23;35:24;"Oh my God."
35:24;35:25;"You're dealing with all these maniacs."
35:25;35:29;"And of all the bands this dude brings up, it's the Eagles."
35:29;35:36;"The most straight up douchebag, baby boomer power band."
35:36;35:37;"I know. It's like..."
35:37;35:39;"That band stands for..."
35:39;35:40;"Look, you and I both like the Eagles."
35:40;35:41;"Oh, I love the Eagles."
35:41;35:42;"You like the Eagles, but it's like..."
35:42;35:46;"Obviously to not address this woman's concerns already shows that this guy's a piece of sh*t."
35:46;35:54;"But it's even like digging himself deeper, the fact that his metaphor for why Fox News maybe is like the Wild West..."
35:54;35:55;"Are you finna Graham Parsons?"
35:55;35:56;"Yeah. Or not."
35:56;35:59;"He should've gone outside of music or been like the Founding Fathers."
35:59;36:02;"That would've been a more Fox News thing, is if he would've been like..."
36:02;36:03;"It's like the Founding Fathers."
36:03;36:04;"Were those men imperfect?"
36:04;36:05;"In many ways."
36:05;36:09;"Did they build a new nation and create freedom for millions of people?"
36:09;36:12;"Yes. That sounds like something a normal Fox News guy would say."
36:12;36:13;"And this dude is just like..."
36:13;36:16;"How dare you? We're the f*cking Eagles."
36:16;36:18;"So they had a second meeting on December 12th."
36:18;36:20;"He once again recommended it."
36:20;36:21;"Oh my god."
36:21;36:29;"Somehow expressing the belief that Ailes, a habitual sexual harasser, and his enablers were a gift to the nation like the Eagles."
36:29;36:31;"Okay, so that is what the metaphor meant."
36:31;36:34;"Yeah. Price you pay for greatness."
36:34;36:37;"You know, the Eagles, they always struck me as like a Republican band."
36:37;36:39;"We've talked about this before, but they actually weren't."
36:39;36:43;"No, Don Henley for sure's politics are not at all Republican."
36:43;36:45;"Mr. Henley, you gotta weigh in on this, man."
36:45;36:47;"Yeah, yeah. Henley needs to come out of the shadows."
36:47;36:49;"One of these nights"
36:49;36:54;"One of these crazy old nights"
36:54;36:59;"We're gonna find out, pretty mama"
36:59;37:03;"What turns on the lights"
37:03;37:09;"The full moon is calling, the fever is high"
37:09;37:13;"And the wicked wind whispers and moans"
37:14;37:18;"You got your demons, you got desires"
37:18;37:22;"But I got a few on my own"
37:22;37:27;"Ooh, someone to be come to"
37:27;37:30;"In between the dark and the light"
37:30;37:36;"Ooh, common life behind you"
37:36;37:38;"Swear I'm gonna find you"
37:38;37:40;"One of these nights"
37:40;37:42;"One of these dreams"
37:43;37:47;"One of these lost and lonely dreams"
37:47;37:51;"We're gonna find one"
37:51;37:56;"Ooh, one with realest screams"
37:56;38:02;"I've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself"
38:02;38:05;"I've been searching for an angel in white"
38:05;38:10;"I've been waiting for a woman who's a little bold"
38:10;38:14;"And I can feel her but she's nowhere inside"
38:14;38:20;"Ooh, commonness behind you"
38:20;38:23;"In between the wrong and the right"
38:23;38:29;"Ooh, common life behind you"
38:29;38:31;"Swear I'm gonna find you"
38:31;38:33;"One of these nights"
38:33;38:35;"You ready to talk about Pepsi?"
38:35;38:36;"You know it."
38:36;38:39;"Pepsi's come up on Time Crisis quite a few times."
38:39;38:40;"Yeah."
38:40;38:43;"The reason we're talking about it this week, for anybody who hasn't been following the news,"
38:43;38:47;"is that Pepsi dropped a controversial advertisement starring Kendall Jenner."
38:47;38:48;"Did you watch it, Jake?"
38:48;38:49;"Yep."
38:49;38:53;"You know, lately there have been a lot of these kind of mini-movie prestige commercials."
38:53;38:55;"Like the Budweiser one."
38:55;38:57;"Like the Budweiser one, which I also thought was hilarious."
38:57;38:59;"This was a Budweiser Super Bowl ad,"
38:59;39:03;"and basically they turned the founding of Budweiser into an immigrant story,"
39:03;39:06;"where you saw the original..."
39:06;39:08;"Anheuser-Meet-Busch."
39:08;39:09;"Yeah."
39:09;39:10;"Adolphus Busch."
39:10;39:12;"You see him in Germany,"
39:12;39:15;"and he says to his family, ""I want to go to America to make beer."""
39:15;39:17;"And then he comes to America, he gets off the boat..."
39:17;39:18;"And it's like, ""There'll be blood."""
39:18;39:20;"It looks like there'll be blood meets like gangs in New York."
39:20;39:23;"And yeah, he gets to America, and the first thing they say to him is,"
39:23;39:24;"""Go home!"""
39:24;39:25;"""You're not welcome here."""
39:26;39:29;"And then he shares a moment,"
39:29;39:31;"almost looks like on the Mississippi River,"
39:31;39:33;"with a black man."
39:33;39:35;"It's basically showing, like a..."
39:35;39:38;"Turning the story of Anheuser-Busch,"
39:38;39:39;"which is now a gigantic corporation,"
39:39;39:42;"which I believe is owned by a Brazilian company now."
39:42;39:43;"Belgian."
39:43;39:44;"Belgian?"
39:44;39:45;"I believe it's called InBev."
39:45;39:46;"You know what, Jake?"
39:46;39:48;"This is one of those rare times when we're both right."
39:48;39:49;"School me."
39:49;39:51;"InBev was a brewing company that resulted from the merger"
39:51;39:54;"between Belgian-based company Interbrew"
39:54;39:56;"and Brazilian brewer AmBev."
39:56;39:57;"Okay."
39:57;39:59;"That took place in 2004, and then..."
39:59;40:01;"Something happened, who cares."
40:01;40:02;"I think they're headquartered in Brussels."
40:02;40:03;"Anyway."
40:03;40:06;"This was one of those Super Bowl ads that was kind of like..."
40:06;40:08;"Turned the story of Anheuser-Busch"
40:08;40:10;"into this immigrant story."
40:10;40:13;"Like, the guy came to America because he wanted to make beer."
40:13;40:15;"Roll your sleeves up, get to work."
40:15;40:17;"I don't know why he couldn't make beer in Germany."
40:17;40:21;"Maybe at the time, you didn't have freedom to brew in Germany."
40:21;40:22;"Maybe it was harder to be an entrepreneur,"
40:22;40:24;"for whatever reason."
40:24;40:25;"Yeah."
40:25;40:27;"Rising socialism, man."
40:27;40:30;"Or the social stratification was really harsh, I don't know."
40:30;40:33;"So anyway, that commercial was like this mini-movie"
40:33;40:39;"that turned the story of a beer produced by a gigantic international company"
40:39;40:41;"into a story that you're drinking history,"
40:41;40:44;"you're drinking the American dream,"
40:44;40:46;"you're drinking immigration."
40:46;40:49;"When you drink that brew, you're honoring"
40:49;40:51;"not only the story of Adolphus Busch,"
40:51;40:53;"you're honoring your own family's immigration story"
40:53;40:55;"because all Americans are immigrants,"
40:55;40:57;"except for Native Americans,"
40:57;41:00;"who obviously don't get to tell their side of the story"
41:00;41:02;"in the Budweiser commercial."
41:02;41:04;"So anyway, there have been a lot of commercials like that."
41:04;41:08;"And then, you know, Pepsi, famously a youth brand,"
41:08;41:10;"decides they want to do a kind of youthful take on this."
41:10;41:13;"So they make this commercial that's Kendall Jenner,"
41:13;41:16;"famous model, part of the Kardashian-Jenner family."
41:16;41:17;"It's like a mini-movie, it's like two minutes,"
41:17;41:19;"and there's a lot of different characters,"
41:19;41:21;"and it's a very diverse cast."
41:21;41:24;"Basically, there's some kind of big protest going on outside."
41:24;41:27;"She is doing a photo shoot, wearing a blonde wig."
41:27;41:29;"This is one of my favorite details, too."
41:29;41:32;"In the commercial, she's busy doing her job, you know?"
41:32;41:34;"She's a model. She's wearing a blonde wig."
41:34;41:39;"But then she sees the passion of all these different people"
41:39;41:41;"marching for this generic..."
41:41;41:44;"Yeah, it's unclear what the cause of the protest is."
41:44;41:47;"One of the signs that somebody's holding says,"
41:47;41:49;"""Join the conversation."""
41:54;41:57;"Historically, when the police state refuses to join the conversation,"
41:57;42:00;"that's when people get out in the streets and say,"
42:00;42:02;"""Join the conversation, man."""
42:02;42:05;"So anyway, I love this. She's taking pictures,"
42:05;42:08;"and she sees this generic protest go by."
42:08;42:11;"And she says, ""You know what? I can't stay here,"
42:11;42:15;"""being some corporate stooge, taking pictures for Cosmo."""
42:15;42:17;"""Sell international brands."""
42:17;42:19;"""I'm not trying to sell international brands."""
42:19;42:20;"""In Jakarta."""
42:20;42:23;"""I don't want to be the face of selling a product."""
42:23;42:26;"""I want to get in the streets and join this generic protest."""
42:26;42:29;"She grabs a Pepsi, as one does, gets in the protest."
42:29;42:31;"You die in a thirst."
42:31;42:34;"She follows the protest and sees they come up against a police barricade."
42:34;42:38;"And she's the only one who's brave enough, of the assembled mass,"
42:38;42:40;"to approach the police officer."
42:40;42:42;"And she gives him a Pepsi."
42:42;42:44;"He drinks it, cracks a smile to his buddy,"
42:44;42:47;"and then inexplicably everybody starts chanting,"
42:47;42:49;"awkwardly throwing their hands in the air."
42:49;42:52;"There's also this whole subplot about a woman in a hijab"
42:52;42:54;"who's a frustrated photographer."
42:54;42:56;"She's like a journalist or something?"
42:56;42:59;"Yeah. Anyway, we can talk more about this specific thing later."
42:59;43:02;"We're going to get on the phone with Deezus, Deezus Nice,"
43:02;43:04;"aka Young Chipotle."
43:04;43:05;"Young Chipotle?"
43:05;43:07;"We should also ask him about that."
43:07;43:08;"That's a tight name."
43:08;43:10;"But just so people understand."
43:10;43:11;"That's what we're talking about."
43:11;43:13;"Oh, and what's the soundtrack?"
43:13;43:15;"It's a song from Skip Marley."
43:15;43:17;"And he's the grandson of Bob?"
43:17;43:19;"Yes. Skip has been out there a lot recently."
43:19;43:21;"That seems sane."
43:21;43:22;"That's a tough one."
43:22;43:24;"And I don't know Skip Marley personally,"
43:24;43:26;"and I don't know much of his music."
43:26;43:29;"I will just say that, at least with his big looks,"
43:29;43:33;"back to back, he kind of dropped a somewhat innocuous verse"
43:33;43:35;"in the Katy Perry song about--"
43:35;43:38;"I don't want to say innocuous, but let's say kind of general language"
43:38;43:42;"about fighting the power and sticking together."
43:42;43:44;"That's what his grandfather did."
43:44;43:46;"One love."
43:46;43:48;"No, but Bob got deep, man."
43:48;43:50;"I love Bob. I'm all in on Bob."
43:50;43:53;"And we're not anti-Skip Marley, but it's like--"
43:53;43:55;"When you look at a lot of Bob's lyrics,"
43:55;44:00;"the ones that are not Rasta-specific are very general."
44:00;44:03;"And that can be great. John Lennon wrote really general lyrics."
44:03;44:05;"Yeah, no, but he had specific."
44:05;44:06;"Bob didn't do Pepsi ads."
44:06;44:10;"Bob did not do Pepsi ads, although now there is a Bob Marley-branded"
44:10;44:14;"series of beverages, teas, iced coffees."
44:14;44:16;"Whatever. This is not about Skip Marley,"
44:16;44:19;"but of course you can imagine that the people who put together the Pepsi ad"
44:19;44:22;"were like, ""Oh, we'll also get the grandson of Bob Marley."""
44:22;44:24;"It's like--"
44:24;44:27;"It is a little bit about Skip Marley in the sense that, yeah,"
44:27;44:30;"they're using his legacy of this--"
44:30;44:35;"One of the most iconic politically engaged artists of the 20th century"
44:35;44:40;"taking his grandson to leech on his credibility."
44:40;44:42;"Dude, that's a really uncharitable interpretation."
44:42;44:45;"Wait, of Pepsi? That's exactly what Pepsi is doing."
44:45;44:49;"And Skip, you know, he's 19. He didn't know what he was doing."
44:49;44:50;"Psh."
44:50;44:51;"He's making money."
44:51;44:53;"Well, that's something that's come up because Kendall Jenner"
44:53;44:55;"has bared the brunt of the criticism."
44:55;44:56;"Yeah."
44:56;44:58;"I mean, I know we're all postmodern and everything,"
44:58;45:00;"and it's impossible to sell out anymore."
45:00;45:01;"No."
45:01;45:04;"I'm like an old punk rocker over here, but I got to say,"
45:04;45:06;"if that's not an example of selling out, I don't know what is."
45:06;45:09;"Well, good news for you, old punk rocker. People were mad."
45:09;45:13;"I know. I was shocked how big this was on the Internet."
45:13;45:16;"Well, I think it's because this is the era of Black Lives Matter,"
45:16;45:19;"so it's like there's a lot of things people are protesting about,"
45:19;45:22;"but one of the main things that you've been seeing organized protests for"
45:22;45:25;"the past few years in America, at least, has been about Black Lives Matter,"
45:25;45:29;"so you can't use that to sell sugar water."
45:29;45:30;"No."
45:55;46:04;"Oh, why can't we roam the open country?"
46:04;46:08;"Open country."
46:08;46:13;"Oh, why can't we be what we want to be?"
46:13;46:17;"We want to be free."
46:17;46:21;"Want to be free."
46:21;46:27;"Three o'clock in the rain."
46:27;46:34;"And I'm a-blockin', like I have said."
46:34;46:41;"And I've got to throw away."
46:41;46:47;"Yes, I've got to throw away."
46:53;47:00;"My little world star."
47:00;47:13;"Oh, I'm telling you, it's a red-blue music."
47:13;47:26;"Oh, I'm begin to say, red-blue music."
47:26;47:32;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
47:32;47:34;"Let's just talk about the history of Pepsi, man,"
47:34;47:36;"because maybe we don't know enough about Pepsi."
47:36;47:38;"Maybe we're being too hard on Pepsi."
47:38;47:39;"Walk me through."
47:39;47:40;"All right, man."
47:40;47:43;"I mean, I know some of the big bullet points, as discussed earlier."
47:43;47:45;"The first bullet point is incredible."
47:45;47:51;"Pepsi was originally created in the 1890s by Caleb ""Doc"" Bradham in North Carolina."
47:51;47:53;"It's a southern beverage."
47:53;47:56;"And back then, it was known as Brad's drink."
47:56;48:01;"I want the Budweiser ad, or like Pepsi's version of their Budweiser ad."
48:01;48:02;"Yeah."
48:02;48:03;"The founding of Pepsi in North Carolina."
48:03;48:05;"There's so many commercials like that now."
48:05;48:06;"In 1890."
48:06;48:09;"Where they take these like fully like international corporate brands,"
48:09;48:13;"and they try to go back into the history to find that kind of like American entrepreneur vibe,"
48:13;48:20;"where it's kind of like the Dodge Brothers founded Dodge Motors, blah, blah, blah."
48:20;48:25;"Jameson Whiskey, when Mr. Jameson first started brewing his way,"
48:25;48:28;"when Jack Daniel--it's always the same thing."
48:28;48:30;"Like we've been doing this forever, and it's like--"
48:30;48:34;"When World War II veteran Glenn Bell moved back to Southern California"
48:34;48:38;"and opened his own taco stand in Downey, California in 1962,"
48:38;48:39;"the world had no idea."
48:39;48:40;"All this stuff is so brutal."
48:40;48:42;"The Chalupa was soon born."
48:42;48:45;"Almost none of these things are still owned by the original--"
48:45;48:48;"This is all part of like international global capitalism,"
48:48;48:51;"so to like go back to that is so funny."
48:51;48:56;"So it's just like the commercial opens, ""1895, North Carolina."
48:56;49:00;"Caleb 'Doc' Bradham had it up to here with that Coke bullshit."
49:00;49:02;"He started brewing Brad's drink."
49:02;49:05;"Today it's called Pevis."""
49:05;49:08;"""His son had been kicked in the head by a horse."
49:08;49:11;"To nurse his son back to health, he concocted his own medicine."""
49:11;49:12;"Oh, God."
49:12;49:15;"""Pepsi. Pepsi tonic."""
49:15;49:19;"Making these stories up to sell you sugar water."
49:19;49:21;"That's so bad for you."
49:21;49:24;"It's so pathetic, man. It's so brutal."
49:24;49:27;"The ad was funny too because no one in that ad is drinking Pepsi."
49:27;49:30;"Everyone's like--their BMI is like insanely low."
49:30;49:33;"Everyone's like hella fit, working out eight hours a day."
49:33;49:36;"None of the actors would touch a Pepsi, would come anywhere near it."
49:36;49:37;"Of course not."
49:37;49:38;"I love it."
49:38;49:39;"It's play acting."
49:39;49:41;"So then whatever. Pepsi exists for 60 years."
49:41;49:43;"It was the cheap drink."
49:43;49:46;"It was like, all right, they cut dad's overtime."
49:46;49:49;"No more Coke for a Pepsi household now."
49:49;49:51;"It was an embarrassment to drink Pepsi."
49:51;49:55;"But then Pepsi was tired of being a kitchen cola."
49:55;49:57;"It didn't want to be a bargain brand no more."
49:57;50:01;"It wanted to identify itself as a young, fashionable drink."
50:01;50:03;"And so in 1958, that's when it turned."
50:03;50:09;"That's when Pepsi went from this weird Brad's Drink cheap Coke"
50:09;50:11;"to being something for the kids."
50:11;50:16;"The initial catchphrase was, ""Be sociable. Have a Pepsi."""
50:16;50:19;"Pepsi's a drink that you drink when you're hanging out with your young friends."
50:19;50:20;"Be sociable."
50:20;50:23;"So anyway, we've talked before on this show that Pepsi--"
50:23;50:24;"Enter Donald Kendall."
50:24;50:29;"Donald Kendall, a Mad Men type dude who got behind it to really make Pepsi a global brand,"
50:29;50:31;"make sure they were first in the Soviet Union."
50:31;50:34;"This guy's all over the world trying to compete with Coke."
50:34;50:39;"Richard Nixon's working for them in the '60s after losing to JFK in '60"
50:39;50:41;"and before running in '68."
50:41;50:43;"He spent in the mid-'60s being their corporate lawyer."
50:43;50:44;"Right."
50:44;50:45;"Nothing says youth like--"
50:45;50:47;"Like Richard Nixon."
50:47;50:48;"--your corporate lawyer."
50:48;50:50;"Oh, God, it's so crazy."
50:50;50:54;"That'd basically be like maybe after Trump gets impeached,"
50:54;50:57;"Pepsi hires him just to do a few commercials."
50:57;50:58;"Probably somebody will."
50:58;50:59;"I could see it."
50:59;51:00;"He'll be making jokes about--"
51:00;51:01;"Like Rockstar?"
51:01;51:04;"Yeah, he'll be making jokes about being impeached."
51:04;51:07;"He'll be like, ""Wasn't that a crazy 18 months?"""
51:07;51:12;"But not as crazy as the amount of caffeine and taurine in the new Rockstar energy drink."
51:12;51:16;"So anyway, then Pepsi made up some dumb bullshit about being the Pepsi generation"
51:16;51:18;"because Coke was like the good one."
51:18;51:19;"Wait, so when was that? In the '60s?"
51:19;51:20;"That was in the '60s."
51:20;51:23;"Then in 1973, the Pepsi generation continued to evolve."
51:23;51:27;"They became--joined the Pepsi people, feeling free."
51:27;51:31;"So Pepsi's always been about freedom, pretending that it's about--"
51:31;51:33;"They tried to get Joni Mitchell to write a song for them."
51:33;51:35;"Be the free people."
51:37;51:38;"She turned them down."
51:38;51:41;"Then in the '80s, they really start pulling out all the stops,"
51:41;51:43;"and that's when they just start getting pop stars."
51:43;51:48;"They got Lionel Richie, Tina Turner, Gloria Estefan, Madonna, Michael Jackson."
51:48;51:51;"So like every 18 months, they were introducing a new--"
51:51;51:55;"They were just shelling out money, man, and especially Michael Jackson."
51:55;51:59;"Also, do you remember in the early '90s, they had those commercials with Ray Charles and Cindy Crawford?"
51:59;52:01;"Oh, yeah, kind of."
52:01;52:05;"So basically, as we were just talking about before, Pepsi--"
52:05;52:07;"Look, and we know Coke--Coke are bad, too."
52:07;52:09;"Coke's got a lot of blood on there."
52:09;52:10;"I was actually thinking about this."
52:10;52:15;"In some ways, Pepsi is like Hillary, like a moderate liberal that everybody's really hard on"
52:15;52:17;"because it's like trying to be hip."
52:17;52:19;"It's like Pokemon Go to the polls."
52:19;52:23;"Pepsi's like, ""We're cool, man. We're the youthful cola."
52:23;52:28;"We know about protesting and Kendall Jenner and Bob Marley's grandson. Why not?"""
52:28;52:33;"And you hate on them more because the hypocrisy is like, ""God, you're supposed to be the lefty."
52:33;52:35;"You're supposed to be the good one."""
52:35;52:37;"Coke's more like a George W. Bush cola."
52:37;52:39;"Grandfathered in."
52:39;52:44;"Yeah, where they're just kind of like, ""Oh, us? We're just old-school American, man."""
52:44;52:47;"Key difference, though--Coke is a superior beverage."
52:47;52:49;"It is a superior beverage."
52:49;52:52;"What I'm saying--Coke is kind of like a moderate Republican."
52:52;52:54;"And Pepsi is like a moderate liberal."
52:54;52:58;"So with Pepsi, because they're the youth brand, they got to take more chances than Coke."
52:58;53:03;"Coke can just push out the same polar bears every Christmas--Santa Claus."
53:03;53:05;"And it's because it's a superior beverage, honestly."
53:05;53:13;"We don't look to Coke to be all edgy, whereas Pepsi clearly is probably super insecure"
53:13;53:17;"because they know deep, deep down, we know you're just Brad's drink."
53:17;53:21;"It's 1892 North Carolina. You're just Brad's drink, man."
53:21;53:22;"Always going to be number two."
53:22;53:25;"Always going to be number two, but they have to buy friends, basically."
53:25;53:27;"They have to buy Michael Jackson as their friend."
53:27;53:28;"They have to buy Madonna."
53:28;53:30;"And now they bought Kendall Jenner."
53:30;53:32;"And, you know, she knew what she was getting into."
53:32;53:33;"And Skip Marley."
53:33;53:36;"And Skip Marley. I don't want to give everybody a pass."
56:36;56:38;"Now we're going to talk to Desus to weigh in."
56:38;56:41;"Because I know Desus is going to have some opinions on this."
56:41;56:44;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
56:44;56:47;"[Phone ringing]"
56:47;56:48;"What's up Desus?"
56:48;56:51;"What's good? Bonjour from the Bronx."
56:51;56:56;"How are you doing man? Me and Jake are over here in LA doing Time Crisis."
56:56;56:58;"What time is it over there?"
56:58;57:00;"You know it's mid-afternoon man."
57:00;57:01;"Dang man."
57:01;57:03;"We haven't had you on Time Crisis in person for a while."
57:03;57:05;"I miss you guys."
57:05;57:08;"We miss you man. And also mostly because, I should point out,"
57:08;57:12;"because this was not true the last time we had you on the phone."
57:12;57:15;"You've been pretty busy with the hit show,"
57:15;57:17;"Desus and Mero on Viceland."
57:17;57:19;"Desus and Mero on Viceland, yes."
57:19;57:21;"A very popular show. Shout out to Ezra,"
57:21;57:25;"who was one of the exemplary early guests."
57:25;57:27;"He got in early before it became popular."
57:27;57:29;"I was on the first week. That's true."
57:29;57:32;"That's true friends. That's not booking agents. You know what I'm saying?"
57:32;57:33;"That's right. That's right."
57:33;57:35;"People, you've got to watch Desus and Mero."
57:35;57:37;"It's 11pm on Viceland, right?"
57:37;57:42;"Yeah, yeah. Check it out on YouTube and probably on Twitter and stuff like that."
57:42;57:44;"Best show on late night."
57:44;57:45;"Thanks man."
57:45;57:48;"So I know you guys have already covered this on the show."
57:48;57:50;"So that's why I wanted you to weigh in."
57:50;57:54;"But we're over here talking about the whole history of the Pepsi Corporation"
57:54;58:00;"because they dropped one of the worst/greatest commercials of all time this past week."
58:00;58:01;"Exactly."
58:01;58:03;"First of all, we've got to get the Desus take on it."
58:03;58:04;"Now, here's the Desus take."
58:04;58:06;"Everyone I put in was like, ""Oh my God, look at Pepsi."
58:06;58:08;"We've got a boycott. This is horrible. This is tone deaf."""
58:08;58:10;"Desus is a cynic."
58:10;58:13;"And I'm like, ""Yo, I feel like this worked perfectly."""
58:13;58:17;"If you were going to put out an ad and you just wanted to burn it real quick,"
58:17;58:18;"and you wanted to put out--"
58:18;58:19;"It was like--"
58:19;58:22;"They're trying to say this ad will only run in Thailand or something like that."
58:22;58:24;"But this ad was perfect. It got it trending."
58:24;58:26;"Everyone was so mad."
58:26;58:29;"But guess what? For the last 48 hours, all we've been thinking about is Pepsi."
58:29;58:35;"So it was a terrible ad, but it was so bad that you have to imagine that it was done on purpose."
58:35;58:39;"And also shout out to the Chemical Brothers who made a video with Rosario Dawson."
58:39;58:42;"The Kendall video for Pepsi is exactly like that video."
58:42;58:44;"I forgot the name of it, but Google that."
58:44;58:46;"They even stole the concept."
58:46;58:49;"That's why I don't think it was done on purpose."
58:49;58:51;"Because, I mean, let's be for real."
58:51;58:54;"You're tone deaf, but that's a whole other level of tone deaf."
58:54;58:57;"That's 1950s math and tone deaf."
58:57;59:03;"Like, maybe four guys drinking strong vodka martinis at 12 a.m."
59:03;59:05;"while making decisions tone deaf."
59:05;59:07;"You know, Pepsi's not stupid."
59:07;59:11;"Pepsi, when you work with them, they have a lot of layers and email tags and stuff."
59:11;59:13;"You know, it's got the traction it wanted."
59:13;59:16;"So you think it's possible that Pepsi was like,"
59:16;59:18;"""This is a drop of ad that's going to piss everybody off."
59:18;59:20;"At least they'll be talking about us."""
59:20;59:22;"Yes. Because think about it."
59:22;59:24;"At the end of the day, it comes down to what? Pepsi or Coke."
59:24;59:25;"That's it."
59:25;59:27;"Even if you say Coke, they're going to be like, ""All we have is Pepsi."""
59:27;59:30;"If you say, ""I want a Pepsi,"" they say, ""All we have is Coke."""
59:30;59:31;"Pepsi's not going to lose."
59:31;59:35;"If Pepsi's going to advertise for the rest of the year, I feel like they'll be fine."
59:35;59:36;"We're going to still drink Pepsi."
59:36;59:37;"Do you drink Pepsi?"
59:37;59:38;"I actually prefer Coke."
59:38;59:41;"I feel Pepsi's a little harsh on the back of my throat."
59:41;59:44;"Have you ever met anybody who prefers Pepsi?"
59:44;59:48;"I had a co-worker that preferred Pepsi, but her father worked for Pepsi."
59:48;59:50;"So she grew up drinking only Pepsi."
59:50;59:53;"And she swore to me that Coke burned her tongue."
59:53;59:59;"At the end of the day, it's high fructose corn syrup, so let's not kid ourselves."
59:59;01:00:00;"We probably should not be drinking it."
01:00:00;01:00:03;"We really need to be drinking more water, so that's what we're calling it."
01:00:03;01:00:04;"That's true."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"Like Aquafina."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"Yeah."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"Owned by Coca-Cola."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"No, Pepsi."
01:00:09;01:00:11;"Oh, Pepsi-- Oh, Coke owns Dasani."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"Yep."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"All right, Deez, is Aquafina or Dasani?"
01:00:13;01:00:14;"Neither, actually."
01:00:14;01:00:15;"I hate to taste both of those."
01:00:15;01:00:16;"Can you believe that?"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"The best tasting water is New York City tap water."
01:00:18;01:00:19;"I love that."
01:00:19;01:00:24;"When you're in the bodega and it's a hot day, you need to grab a nice cold water."
01:00:24;01:00:25;"What's your go-to brand?"
01:00:25;01:00:29;"I get CG because the CG bottle is like a rectangle."
01:00:29;01:00:33;"And so if people see you drinking it on the subway, they're like, ""Yo, he got a little extra money."""
01:00:33;01:00:35;"And he also doesn't care about the environment."
01:00:35;01:00:38;"So, you know, I just want them to know that's my brand right there."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"You got money and you don't give a--"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"Yeah."
01:00:42;01:00:45;"I'm dating Mother Nature, but I'm not making a real relationship card."
01:00:45;01:00:47;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"Wait, so Deez--"
01:00:49;01:00:50;"That's terrible. I'm sorry."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"No, no, no."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"We appreciate that."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"Earth Day is coming up."
01:00:54;01:00:55;"Yeah."
01:00:55;01:01:00;"I think everybody needs to take a good hard look at their relationship with Mother Nature,"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"given that it's April, Earth Day is about to come."
01:01:02;01:01:04;"To be fair, I have a compost heap, so--"
01:01:04;01:01:05;"You got a compost heap?"
01:01:05;01:01:09;"I do. I have a backyard in the Bronx, and my family's always done compost."
01:01:09;01:01:14;"We use the lawn clippings, and we use some of the food, but you can't just put regular food out there"
01:01:14;01:01:17;"because we have a raccoon problem in the Bronx, so you can't just put anything back there."
01:01:17;01:01:20;"But the compost is pretty good, and one of my parents--it's their house,"
01:01:20;01:01:25;"so when they come and visit, they spread the compost on the lawn for the garden,"
01:01:25;01:01:26;"and they grow vegetables."
01:01:26;01:01:27;"Oh, wow."
01:01:27;01:01:29;"It's like the whole hippie generation thing going on up there."
01:01:29;01:01:32;"If you want some tomatoes, I'll bring them to them."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"You're growing tomatoes in the backyard?"
01:01:33;01:01:34;"Indeed."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"Wow."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"One more question, Deezus."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"We talk a lot about just corporate food."
01:01:39;01:01:43;"We love fast food chains, corporate soda, all those types of things."
01:01:43;01:01:49;"So Jake was not aware that one of your famous nicknames is Young Chipotle."
01:01:49;01:01:51;"Si, si, si. Si, se, puede. Yes."
01:01:51;01:01:55;"Because I also should point out for people who don't know, not only are you and Mero on TV,"
01:01:55;01:01:59;"but you still continue to do the greatest podcast of all time, Bodega Boys."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! Bodega Boys."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"You guys always introduce yourself with all your famous nicknames."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"One of yours is Young Chipotle."
01:02:05;01:02:08;"So what's your relationship to the Chipotle brand?"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"I'm actually sourdough to Chipotle brand."
01:02:10;01:02:14;"I feel at this time I've called myself Young Chipotle long enough and I'm popular enough"
01:02:14;01:02:19;"that I should have got one of those wooden cards from Chipotle where I get a free burrito bowl every day."
01:02:19;01:02:24;"But I think every time they give them to celebrities, they realize celebrities won't use them every day."
01:02:24;01:02:30;"Whereas myself, I will definitely get a burrito bowl every day until I'm like 300 pounds or I just die."
01:02:30;01:02:33;"So I understand Chipotle. There's no hard feelings."
01:02:33;01:02:38;"Oh, right. Yeah, because Chipotle, they'll send one to every member of the Kardashian family."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"That's a thing?"
01:02:39;01:02:44;"That's a thing. You get a wooden, it's a free bowl of Chipotle every day."
01:02:44;01:02:47;"Do you think like Brad Pitt gets a Chipotle card?"
01:02:47;01:02:52;"I don't think he got one. I don't know if Beyonce got one, but a couple of celebrities got one."
01:02:52;01:02:56;"A couple of celebrities from BuzzFeed and other things have gotten some."
01:02:56;01:03:00;"And I'm just like, my name is your name. Give me a card."
01:03:00;01:03:02;"Wow, I'm looking at a picture of it now."
01:03:02;01:03:08;"These are custom-made, handcrafted, sustainably grown burrito cards."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"They're made out of wood."
01:03:10;01:03:13;"Sustainably grown. Wow."
01:03:13;01:03:15;"All right. I want one of those cards."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"I'd rather see you get one before I got one."
01:03:17;01:03:20;"Oh, no, I want both of you to get one."
01:03:20;01:03:23;"If Chipotle is not going to hook up Young Chipotle."
01:03:23;01:03:27;"You know, how can I become old Chipotle if you're not going to hook up Young Chipotle?"
01:03:27;01:03:30;"Exactly."
01:03:30;01:03:33;"All right. Well, thanks for calling, Desus. We'll see you soon."
01:03:33;01:03:35;"Yo, take care, man. We love you."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"All right. Likewise. Have a good one."
01:03:37;01:03:38;"Yeah."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"Oh."
01:03:40;01:03:42;"All the time."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"I don't trip because they know I'm not the line."
01:03:44;01:03:47;"Look in between the lines but like Ali in this prime."
01:03:47;01:03:51;"I still am. I like I like I'm still I'm peace to my slimes."
01:03:51;01:03:55;"Peace to my crips. Neighborhood police and they always on the ship."
01:03:55;01:03:58;"Protect my blood. Look out for my cause."
01:03:58;01:04:00;"When it's all said and done, we beat the realest."
01:04:00;01:04:03;"It was who else if just not us."
01:04:03;01:04:06;"If you got this revolution, please stand up."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"We ain't got no one to trust."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"Time is running up for the burning."
01:04:10;01:04:14;"My God. And if you got the guts, we got a truck."
01:04:14;01:04:17;"We'll give up. I've never had once again."
01:04:17;01:04:20;"Never will forget. Probably never will forget."
01:04:20;01:04:22;"Oh, I guess that's just how it is."
01:04:22;01:04:25;"And they still won't let the black man live."
01:04:25;01:04:29;"The energy surge through my veins when I flow mentally."
01:04:29;01:04:31;"I can never be controlled."
01:04:31;01:04:34;"No sympathy for my enemies exposed."
01:04:34;01:04:36;"But they remember me when I'm gone."
01:04:36;01:04:39;"I say rockabye, rockabye, rockabye, baby."
01:04:39;01:04:42;"Shout out to my, shout out to my, shout out to go crazy."
01:04:42;01:04:45;"Men don't play games, so please don't blame me."
01:04:45;01:04:48;"Look at what they made me."
01:04:48;01:04:52;"I'm part of the reason they still crippin' out in Brooklyn."
01:04:52;01:04:55;"Before I was an artist, I was bookin'."
01:04:55;01:04:58;"Push your shoe back while on the front line."
01:04:58;01:05:01;"Nip it in your lunchtime, I'm bout to stop signs you let at Wi-Fi."
01:05:01;01:05:04;"On mamas for them dirty dollars, brains on collars."
01:05:04;01:05:07;"Park the car around the corner, I'll be there in a second."
01:05:07;01:05:09;"The murder weapon on me."
01:05:09;01:05:11;"Look at this bitch throw a flame in the cops patrol"
01:05:11;01:05:14;"and get that punk-ass American flag ceremony."
01:05:14;01:05:16;"Uh, aw, damn, am I going too far?"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"Give you some flavor to bar."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"Bitch, yeah, it came with the car."
01:05:19;01:05:21;"The soft white leveled the heart."
01:05:21;01:05:22;"Your ball might come with a charge."
01:05:22;01:05:23;"Your kids don't know you no more."
01:05:23;01:05:25;"Your girl try and stay on the floor."
01:05:25;01:05:26;"No phone call accepted in weeks."
01:05:26;01:05:28;"Your son picked up on your beef."
01:05:28;01:05:29;"Real shit."
01:05:29;01:05:31;"From getting lynched and filled in the owning buildings."
01:05:31;01:05:34;"Getting millions, influencing white children."
01:05:34;01:05:36;"And oddly, we still ain't even."
01:05:36;01:05:38;"Still a small percentage of blacks that's eating."
01:05:38;01:05:41;"Same routines, the same dope fiends."
01:05:41;01:05:43;"Them nightmare dreams, forever murder season."
01:05:43;01:05:45;"Bad intentions to them picket fences."
01:05:45;01:05:47;"They gave us guns but won't hire a sniffer."
01:05:47;01:05:49;"So we killing senseless."
01:05:49;01:05:51;"Homies murked on the buzzer benches."
01:05:51;01:05:53;"Retaliation 'cause his mama crying."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"Kept the gangsta 'til I modified."
01:05:55;01:05:57;"Rock the vibe, rock the vibe, vibe, vibe."
01:05:57;01:06:00;"Feel the energy surge through my veins when I flow."
01:06:00;01:06:03;"Mentally, I can never be controlled."
01:06:03;01:06:06;"No sympathy for foes, my enemies exposed."
01:06:06;01:06:09;"But they remember me when I'm gone."
01:06:09;01:06:12;"I say rock the vibe, rock the vibe, rock the vibe, baby."
01:06:12;01:06:15;"Shatter boy, shatter boy, shatter go crazy."
01:06:15;01:06:18;"Men don't play games, so please don't play me."
01:06:18;01:06:20;"Look at what they made me."
01:06:23;01:06:36;"Time Crisis with Ezra K. Newman."
01:06:36;01:06:39;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beasts 1."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"Is it possible? Could Deezus be right?"
01:06:41;01:06:42;"No."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"You don't think Pepsi did it on purpose?"
01:06:44;01:06:45;"Absolutely not."
01:06:45;01:06:46;"Well, okay, then I want--"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"They would never roll a dice like that, knowingly."
01:06:49;01:06:53;"As someone pointed out, this came out on the anniversary of Martin Luther King's death."
01:06:53;01:06:56;"Could be a coincidence, or it could be that somebody was like,"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"""You know what? We're not going to make a big deal out of it,"
01:06:58;01:07:01;"but if we drop this on that day..."""
01:07:01;01:07:03;"I wonder if they literally were dreaming about this."
01:07:03;01:07:08;"They were like, ""People will be so excited that we're engaging with the political moment,"
01:07:08;01:07:11;"and somebody--we're doing this very subtly--"
01:07:11;01:07:15;"somebody's going to point out in a tweet or a Facebook post,"
01:07:15;01:07:20;"'What a nice resonance that on the anniversary of one of our greatest civil rights leaders"
01:07:20;01:07:25;"being assassinated, Pepsi has dropped a commercial"
01:07:25;01:07:28;"that reminds us of our civic responsibility to protest.'"""
01:07:28;01:07:30;"I can imagine they were kind of hoping that would happen."
01:07:30;01:07:31;"That's amazing."
01:07:31;01:07:35;"I like to think about the meetings that were happening this past week."
01:07:35;01:07:36;"I wonder if someone's going to get fired."
01:07:36;01:07:37;"Clowning on it so hard."
01:07:37;01:07:41;"Okay, but Deezus could be right that it could increase sales in a weird way."
01:07:41;01:07:44;"It's pretty funny that a beverage company is so thirsty."
01:07:44;01:07:45;"Dad joke."
01:07:45;01:07:51;"But it's possible that Pepsi just needs to remind people they exist over and over again."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"They buy friends."
01:07:52;01:07:54;"They have to pay Beyonce stupid money."
01:07:54;01:07:57;"They have to drop these dumb, wannabe hip ads."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"One thing I want to say about this,"
01:07:59;01:08:02;"I've seen some people be like, ""Well, you know, don't get mad at Kendall."
01:08:02;01:08:04;"Don't get mad at Skip Marley."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"Get mad at these shadowy people behind the scenes."""
01:08:06;01:08:07;"Yeah."
01:08:07;01:08:08;"That's complete nonsense."
01:08:08;01:08:12;"People have to take responsibility, and I also just want to say,"
01:08:12;01:08:15;"I don't know for sure, but as I've pointed out a few times on the show,"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"I am a media professional."
01:08:17;01:08:20;"I have worked in show business for over nine years."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"I've been in those rooms."
01:08:22;01:08:26;"I've met the corporate head honchos, my music's been in commercials,"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"and I'm not trying to say that Kendall Jenner's a bad person."
01:08:28;01:08:31;"I just want to make something clear about how the world works."
01:08:31;01:08:37;"Don't give a young model or singer, in Skip Marley's case, this huge pass."
01:08:37;01:08:42;"When somebody asks you to be in something, to do an endorsement deal,"
01:08:42;01:08:45;"or even to use your song, anybody with half a brain,"
01:08:45;01:08:50;"certainly anybody with a whole team, knows that you can ask for the creative."
01:08:50;01:08:51;"That's what they call it."
01:08:51;01:08:52;"What's the creative?"
01:08:52;01:08:55;"And if they don't want to give it to you, then that's a decision you make."
01:08:55;01:08:56;"Wait, I'm sorry."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"What does that mean?"
01:08:57;01:09:01;"So, for instance, once a really big corporate bank that's been involved"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"in a lot of shady finance stuff asked you to use a Vampire Weekend song"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"in a big commercial."
01:09:05;01:09:06;"Wow."
01:09:06;01:09:08;"I didn't even need to ask what the creative was because they're just like,"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"""No, that's too brutal."
01:09:10;01:09:12;"Obviously, I don't have hard and fast rules about corporate stuff,"""
01:09:12;01:09:14;"but I was like, ""No, can't do that."""
01:09:14;01:09:17;"Other times, you get offered something, they might throw a number at you"
01:09:17;01:09:20;"and say what song they want to use, and then you can say to yourself,"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"""Well, do I want to be responsible about this?"""
01:09:22;01:09:25;"And in that instance, you would say to your manager or whoever,"
01:09:25;01:09:27;"""Well, what's the commercial about?"""
01:09:27;01:09:28;"So it's like the context."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"And that's a very standard ask."
01:09:29;01:09:33;"It's not like they carry this around in a briefcase and day of,"
01:09:33;01:09:36;"""Kendall Jenner gets there,"" and they're purposely hiding it from her."
01:09:36;01:09:40;"She probably got a brief the same way that if you were an actor or something"
01:09:40;01:09:46;"and somebody was like, ""Hey, this is a movie about a protest,"""
01:09:46;01:09:48;"you might say, ""Can I see the script?"""
01:09:48;01:09:50;"Sure, sure, sure."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"I just want people to understand that."
01:09:51;01:09:53;"I'm not trying to say that you should be extra mad at Kendall Jenner,"
01:09:53;01:09:56;"but she and everybody who participates in commercials"
01:09:56;01:09:59;"has at least some responsibility to see if there's something"
01:09:59;01:10:01;"brutally tone-deaf about it."
01:10:01;01:10:04;"And, look, maybe sometimes the rug gets pulled out from you."
01:10:04;01:10:08;"That's a little bit impossible when you're the star and you're in it."
01:10:08;01:10:10;"So, look, she seems like a nice person."
01:10:10;01:10:12;"Let's just hope maybe she learned from it."
01:10:12;01:10:16;"But the idea that things like this happen because of shadowy corporate people"
01:10:16;01:10:22;"and not because she's the person who I'm sure got the single biggest check"
01:10:22;01:10:25;"to participate in this, probably more than the director,"
01:10:25;01:10:26;"this is like a big deal."
01:10:26;01:10:28;"So, anyway, I just want people to know that."
01:10:28;01:10:31;"Be sympathetic to her, as you should be sympathetic to all human beings,"
01:10:31;01:10:35;"but don't pretend that somebody like her doesn't know what's happening"
01:10:35;01:10:36;"in the commercial."
01:10:36;01:10:38;"I'll be sympathetic because she's young and she's, I'm sure,"
01:10:38;01:10:43;"surrounded by a bubble, and so she has no context for maybe understanding"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"how that ad would resonate."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"Yeah, I guess. When you were 21--"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"I was working a landscaping gig."
01:10:49;01:10:52;"When you were 21, you had a band?"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"Yeah, okay."
01:10:53;01:10:55;"You had a Guided by Voices-inspired band?"
01:10:55;01:10:56;"Let's play this out."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"Let's play Devil Goes Advocate."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"I had a few bands."
01:10:58;01:10:59;"One of them was called Orlando."
01:10:59;01:11:01;"It was like a two-person punk band."
01:11:01;01:11:05;"All right, so I'm just saying, this is Jake, you're Kendall Jenner's age,"
01:11:05;01:11:08;"you're in college in Portland, Oregon, and you've got a punk band"
01:11:08;01:11:09;"called Orlando."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"I'm also in a band called The Buff Guys."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"I like The Buff Guys' name better."
01:11:12;01:11:15;"Buff Guys was like Dinosaur Jr. meets Def Leppard."
01:11:15;01:11:18;"Okay, so you're in this band, Dinosaur Jr. meets Def Leppard,"
01:11:18;01:11:21;"maybe a young cat on campus, a film studies major,"
01:11:21;01:11:25;"says, ""Jake, man, I'd love to make a Buff Guys video,"
01:11:25;01:11:29;"and I want to screen it in front of the whole dining hall, man."""
01:11:29;01:11:33;"Are you just going to say, ""All right, Brad, make it and screen it"
01:11:33;01:11:36;"with our music, no questions asked."""
01:11:36;01:11:38;"You might say, ""Brad, what's the idea, man?"""
01:11:38;01:11:42;"And then he says to you, ""All right, Jake, this is my idea."
01:11:42;01:11:44;"You're modeling with a blonde wig."""
01:11:44;01:11:46;"A generic protest goes by."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"You guys are a Buff Guys practice."
01:11:48;01:11:51;"Inspired by the current struggle of black people"
01:11:51;01:11:54;"against the white supremacist police state,"
01:11:54;01:11:58;"you roll out, take the lead, hand a Pepsi to the cop,"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"everybody goes wild."
01:12:00;01:12:03;"At 21, are you doing it?"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"No, I'm not."
01:12:05;01:12:08;"The way you said it, I would have done some dumb stuff."
01:12:08;01:12:11;"I think you would have had half a brain about what was happening in America."
01:12:11;01:12:14;"Well, I don't want to be harsh on her either, but it's like--"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"I just always find that funny."
01:12:16;01:12:19;"I think the earliest stage of my life that I feel like"
01:12:19;01:12:23;"I bear zero responsibility for my mistakes,"
01:12:23;01:12:26;"I'm going to say, was 11."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"Wow, that's early."
01:12:28;01:12:30;"No, but to say zero--"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"I got you. I got you."
01:12:32;01:12:34;"Because literally, when you're 12 or 13, that's kind of the age"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"where you have to start to grow up a little bit and realize,"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"""Maybe I said something that hurt my friends' feelings."""
01:12:38;01:12:41;"That's the early version, and then, you know,"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"by the time you're a senior in high school,"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"you hopefully have a lot more perspective."
01:12:45;01:12:48;"And then by the time you're in college, it's like, ""Come on."""
01:12:48;01:12:50;"By the time I was a senior in college,"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"I don't think my demeanor has changed."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"I don't think my demeanor has changed very much"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"since I was a senior in college."
01:12:56;01:12:58;"I think I met you then, and I don't think your demeanor has changed."
01:12:58;01:13:00;"Yeah, thank you. Or I think."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"Your hair's gotten longer."
01:13:02;01:13:04;"In short, I don't know. Longer in short."
01:13:04;01:13:06;"You have, like, a shaved head."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"One last thing with Kendall Jenner, and again,"
01:13:08;01:13:12;"I do believe that even when you're old enough to know better,"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"you're never too old to be given a second chance."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"I believe that. You know, people mess up and you learn."
01:13:17;01:13:20;"Especially with stuff like art that's open to interpretation."
01:13:20;01:13:23;"Like Pepsi ads. Like Pepsi ads."
01:13:23;01:13:25;"Artistic endeavors."
01:13:25;01:13:27;"'Cause you were saying, like, maybe she lives in a bubble."
01:13:27;01:13:29;"Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is like, all right, whatever."
01:13:29;01:13:31;"But anyway."

01:13:40;01:13:43;"# For a while #"
01:13:43;01:13:46;"I'm sure Kendall is probably thinking long and hard about it,"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"so don't go too hard on her, you know?"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"[laughter]"
01:13:50;01:13:51;"Who knows?"
01:13:51;01:13:54;"I don't give a flying F."
01:13:54;01:13:57;"In some ways, situations like this,"
01:13:57;01:13:59;"I hate to say it, but it's like,"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"they don't make me feel like,"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"you know what? Kendall may be messed up,"
01:14:03;01:14:06;"she'll learn a valuable lesson, so will her fans,"
01:14:06;01:14:09;"so will the people who work at Pepsi, this is open and interesting."
01:14:09;01:14:11;"Kind of when you get to the end of a story like this,"
01:14:11;01:14:14;"like, Sugarwater Company exploits real-world stuff,"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"and then the whole debate is about,"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"""Kendall should have known better, shouldn't she have?"""
01:14:18;01:14:20;"You're kind of not left with a feeling of, like,"
01:14:20;01:14:23;"""We can do better."" You're kind of left with the feeling of,"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"""Nothing matters."""
01:14:25;01:14:26;"Literally nothing matters."
01:14:26;01:14:28;"We will literally never think about this again."
01:14:28;01:14:31;"Like, within two weeks, it'll just be completely"
01:14:31;01:14:33;"in the rearview mirror and just, like, gone."
01:14:33;01:14:36;"Well, also, I think something that's funny about this is that"
01:14:36;01:14:39;"this commercial was tone-deaf."
01:14:39;01:14:40;"It was in poor taste."
01:14:40;01:14:43;"It was demeaning to the people who are out there protesting"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"for their lives, really."
01:14:45;01:14:46;"It's true."
01:14:46;01:14:49;"But the fact--we're so far gone in terms of our relationship"
01:14:49;01:14:51;"to corporate culture and stuff."
01:14:51;01:14:54;"Pepsi's been whittling us down for 60 years."
01:14:54;01:14:56;"Yeah, this time they kind of messed up."
01:14:56;01:14:59;"But next time, they'll do a more tasteful ad about--"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"like, this is what's going to happen, by the way."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"Pepsi's going to probably fire a bunch of people."
01:15:03;01:15:07;"Their next campaign is going to be, like, super diverse"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"and really, like, tackle issues."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"And then people are going to applaud them,"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"and we're going to kind of forget that, like,"
01:15:13;01:15:17;"we now look to sugar water companies to be in charge of our culture."
01:15:17;01:15:20;"And I understand people might say, ""Well, it is part of our culture,"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"so of course we have to critique it."""
01:15:22;01:15:25;"I agree, but it's like this should not be a reminder"
01:15:25;01:15:28;"that corporate branding should do better."
01:15:28;01:15:30;"This should be a reminder that, like--"
01:15:30;01:15:31;"It's all."
01:15:31;01:15:37;"It's all horrible and, like, smash the state, up the workers, whatever."

01:15:40;01:15:41;"Oh, yeah."

01:15:48;01:15:51;"Okay, we're comparing this week's top five songs on iTunes"
01:15:51;01:15:56;"to the top five Billboard hits of 1984, the year that I was born."

01:28:09;01:28:11;"- No, I'm kidding. - No, I'm kidding."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"- That would be cool. But anyway, no, he's--"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"the club--mate."
01:28:15;01:28:17;"""The club isn't the best place to find a lover."""
01:28:17;01:28:19;"- Bobby Jean is about Steve Van Sant's abs."
01:28:19;01:28:21;"- That's cool."
01:28:21;01:28:25;"Too many heterosexual men are afraid to just compliment each other's bodies."
01:28:25;01:28:28;"Like, what is that? We know what that's about."
01:28:28;01:28:31;"Anyway, ""The club isn't the best place to find a lover."""
01:28:31;01:28:34;"- Yeah, true. - ""So the bar is where I go."
01:28:34;01:28:37;"""Me and my friends at the table doing shots real fast,"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"""then we talk slow."" So let's just break it down."
01:28:39;01:28:41;"- So that means, like, you're drunk, you're slurring?"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"- Or--okay. - ""We talk slow."""
01:28:43;01:28:46;"- I was just, like, heard this song on the radio again,"
01:28:46;01:28:48;"and I just, like, was thinking about that opening line."
01:28:48;01:28:50;"I gotta give him props for the delivery."
01:28:50;01:28:52;"It's kind of a mouthful, but he does it really well."

01:28:54;01:28:56;"""so the bar is where I go."""
01:28:56;01:28:58;"But basically, think about what he's saying."
01:28:58;01:29:00;"""I'm looking for a lover."""
01:29:00;01:29:03;"Just looking for a lover is already just such, like, a weird concept."
01:29:03;01:29:06;"So basically, you're just picturing, like, horned-up Ed Sheeran"
01:29:06;01:29:08;"wants to have sex tonight."
01:29:08;01:29:10;"And he's going through a mental checklist. - Not gonna get on Tinder."
01:29:10;01:29:13;"- Yeah, I guess for whatever reason, he doesn't use Tinder."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"Maybe because he's Ed Sheeran."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"That's a good enough reason."
01:29:17;01:29:19;"So Ed Sheeran clearly wants to have sex."
01:29:19;01:29:21;"And also, you know, some people might say,"
01:29:21;01:29:25;"""Well, 'lover' could also just mean, like, a boyfriend/girlfriend person."""
01:29:25;01:29:29;"But, you know, in this instance-- - He's looking for a one-night."
01:29:29;01:29:32;"- It kind of seems like that. It turns out to be more, but--"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"- He's on the prowl. - If you're looking for a boyfriend--"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"or girlfriend, you don't say,"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"""You're not gonna find a girlfriend at the club."
01:29:38;01:29:40;"""You're gonna find a girlfriend at the bar."""

01:29:48;01:29:50;"- She's single. She just broke up with her fiancé."
01:29:50;01:29:53;"- Yeah. [laughter]"
01:29:53;01:29:55;"But anyway, we know that he's talking about sex"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"when we really break it down, which is fine."
01:29:57;01:30:01;"It's a classic part of what it means, you know, being a human being."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"So the club is not the best place to find a lover."
01:30:03;01:30:06;"So basically, in his head, he's thinking,"
01:30:06;01:30:09;"""Ed Sheeran wants sex tonight."" - Yeah."
01:30:09;01:30:12;"- And then he's going through a mental checklist."
01:30:12;01:30:14;"Where is Ed Sheeran gonna find sex?"
01:30:14;01:30:16;"- The club. - Is it gonna be the club?"
01:30:16;01:30:18;"No, for whatever--you know, some of those Jersey Shore guys,"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"they tend to find sex at the club."
01:30:20;01:30:22;"Not Ed Sheeran. Not much of a dancer."
01:30:22;01:30:25;"Where does Ed Sheeran find sex? The bar."
01:30:25;01:30:27;"So the bar is where I go."
01:30:27;01:30:30;"And what do I do to get the sex at the bar?"
01:30:30;01:30:33;"I do a lot of shots very quickly with my friends,"
01:30:33;01:30:36;"and then I go up and speak slowly to women."
01:30:36;01:30:38;"- Get hammered. - [laughs]"
01:30:38;01:30:43;"- And I stumble up to women. - Suddenly this song sounds a lot less sexy."
01:30:43;01:30:45;"Maybe it never sounded sexy."
01:30:45;01:30:48;"- And they're gonna end up at a Chinese place."
01:30:48;01:30:51;"- Yeah, at the cheap Chinese buffet."
01:30:51;01:30:54;"- This song's actually, like, kind of amazingly realistic."
01:30:54;01:30:58;"- Mundane. Yeah, realistic. - Like, brutal realism."
01:30:58;01:31:00;"- Nothing suave about it."
01:31:00;01:31:02;"His delivery's kind of suave."
01:31:02;01:31:04;"- [singing] Isn't the best place to find a lover"
01:31:04;01:31:07;"- But really, when you break it down, this is a dude being like,"
01:31:07;01:31:10;"""I can't pull at the club. You always get girls at the club,"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"but I never get girls at the club. We're going to the bar."""
01:31:12;01:31:15;"- This is like a Kevin Smith movie. - Yeah, exactly."
01:31:15;01:31:19;"- They're gonna end up, like, crushing Chinese food."
01:31:19;01:31:22;"- It's like-- - At 2 a.m.?"
01:31:22;01:31:25;"- Ed Sheeran's like, ""So when I'm trying to get a woman,"
01:31:25;01:31:29;"I always go to the bar because my dance moves"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"are not what gets me women."
01:31:31;01:31:34;"Getting blackout drunk is what gets me women."""
01:31:34;01:31:38;"But the problem is... - Picturing Jay and Silent Bob"
01:31:38;01:31:41;"rolling with Ed Sheeran."
01:31:41;01:31:45;"- In the movie, it's Kevin James and Jay and Silent Bob together."
01:31:45;01:31:48;"And then they get there, look around at the girls,"
01:31:48;01:31:51;"and it's like, ""All right, fellas, five shots, five minutes."
01:31:51;01:31:53;"Let's do this. Get blackout drunk."""
01:31:53;01:31:56;"But then the thing is, when you drink that much--"
01:31:56;01:31:58;"- Wait, what are they-- is that Dutch courage,"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"is when you get drunk enough to do something"
01:32:00;01:32:02;"you wouldn't normally do? - Yeah, I don't know."
01:32:02;01:32:05;"- So Ed finally gets drunk enough to go over to the--"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"when he says, ""We talk slow,"" he means slurring."
01:32:07;01:32:09;"I go over to a girl. - Hey."
01:32:09;01:32:11;"- ""Hey, I'm Ed Sheeran."" And then he's like,"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"""You want to go back to my place?"" And she's like, ""I guess."""
01:32:13;01:32:16;"And he's like, ""Actually..."" - I'm f---ing hungry."
01:32:16;01:32:19;"- ""I'm f---ing hungry. Let's go to the Chinese buffet place."
01:32:19;01:32:22;"I'm starving. I drank way too much way too quick."""
01:32:22;01:32:25;"- I'm so hungry."
01:32:25;01:32:28;"- ""I could murder a plate of orange chicken right now."""
01:32:28;01:32:31;"- Hungry. - And then they get there,"
01:32:31;01:32:34;"and then finally-- - This place better have beer."
01:32:34;01:32:37;"- Oh, he's still drinking. - Drinking at the Chinese place."
01:32:37;01:32:39;"- At the Chinese place. And that's when he says,"
01:32:39;01:32:42;"""Fill up your bag."" And then he says to her, like,"
01:32:42;01:32:45;"""This girl's there just, like, watching 'Drunk Ed Sheeran.'"""
01:32:45;01:32:47;"And then he's like-- he just, like, comes back"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"with, like, five egg rolls in his hand,"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"just, like, opens her purse, sticks it in, and he's like,"
01:32:51;01:32:54;"""I'm gonna want that later. Don't let the buffet guy see."""
01:32:54;01:32:58;"And then finally, after that romantic courtship,"
01:32:58;01:32:59;"they start making out in the cab."
01:32:59;01:33:03;"- Greasy Chinese food breath. - Biggest hit of the year."
01:33:03;01:33:04;"- [laughs]"
01:33:04;01:33:06;"- A strike and a nerve. - Yeah, you know--"
01:33:06;01:33:08;"- Everyone can relate, man. - You know, yeah, you're right."
01:33:08;01:33:12;"A lot of people get drunk as a way to loosen up,"
01:33:12;01:33:15;"which is not a bad thing. It's just, like, a shame."
01:33:15;01:33:16;"- [laughs]"
01:33:16;01:33:19;"- I would just say to the younger folks listening,"
01:33:19;01:33:23;"when you're Ed Sheeran's age and you want to go have sex,"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"learn to dance. That's what I'm saying,"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"because then you can go to the club,"
01:33:27;01:33:28;"you can strut your stuff,"
01:33:28;01:33:30;"you don't have to get blackout drunk."
01:33:30;01:33:32;"In fact, you're getting exercise."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"- You're drinking a vitamin water."
01:33:34;01:33:35;"- You're drinking a vitamin water,"
01:33:35;01:33:38;"you're moving, you're feeling good."
01:33:38;01:33:40;"You can meet somebody at the club,"
01:33:40;01:33:41;"and also, if they want to talk,"
01:33:41;01:33:44;"you go, ""Hey, you want to go to the quieter part of the club"
01:33:44;01:33:45;"and we'll talk?"""
01:33:45;01:33:46;"Bars are so loud anyway."
01:33:46;01:33:49;"- ""Quieter part of the club."" - It exists."
01:33:49;01:33:50;"Let's go stand outside for a second."
01:33:50;01:33:51;"- Sometimes you need a couple drinks,"
01:33:51;01:33:54;"so to give you, as you said, courage."
01:33:54;01:33:57;"- I just don't like this dichotomy that he's setting up."
01:33:57;01:33:59;"- It's hard to imagine just dancing in a club sober."
01:33:59;01:34:01;"- Well, exactly, but you know what I realized?"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"- I don't have a confid-- I'm a terrible dancer."
01:34:03;01:34:04;"I can relate to Ed here."
01:34:04;01:34:05;"- I'm a terrible dancer, too,"
01:34:05;01:34:08;"but I've been learning some dance moves recently."
01:34:08;01:34:09;"- Really? - Kind of."
01:34:09;01:34:10;"- Interesting."
01:34:10;01:34:12;"- I was interested in this dance move that's kind of--"
01:34:12;01:34:13;"it's a classic, basic dance move,"
01:34:13;01:34:16;"but it's associated with Morse Day and the time,"
01:34:16;01:34:17;"where your legs kind of swing."
01:34:17;01:34:18;"I just wanted to learn it."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"And then, like, I was at a party,"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"and, like, everybody just started doing it,"
01:34:21;01:34:22;"and I was like, ""You know what?"
01:34:22;01:34:24;"""When you actually, like, learn a dance move,"
01:34:24;01:34:25;"""you kind of just want to keep doing it."

01:34:29;01:34:31;"I mean, maybe people disagree. That's my entry."
01:34:31;01:34:33;"So anyway, I just want to say to Ed, like,"
01:34:33;01:34:36;"I'm not judging, but don't write off the club."
01:34:36;01:34:38;"- Well, maybe in a year or two, he'll come out"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"with his club version. - You know what's funny?"
01:34:40;01:34:42;"They probably play this song in clubs."
01:34:42;01:34:43;"- Totally. - So imagine you're"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"on the dance floor. - And in Chinese restaurants."
01:34:45;01:34:47;"- And in Chinese-- all right, that's--"
01:34:47;01:34:48;"- And in cabs. They play it everywhere."

01:55:42;01:55:44;"and then, so, they had to go to the hospital,"
01:55:44;01:55:45;"and they had to pump his stomach,"
01:55:45;01:55:46;"but they had to induce vomiting,"
01:55:46;01:55:50;"and they made him chug, like, mustard and milk?"
01:55:50;01:55:51;"- Ooh."
01:55:51;01:55:52;"- They, like, mixed, like,"
01:55:52;01:55:53;"a half gallon of mustard and milk,"
01:55:53;01:55:56;"and, like, I'm picturing my dad, like, 18,"
01:55:56;01:55:59;"and, like, 1966 or whatever,"
01:55:59;01:56:02;"just, like, pounding mustard and milk"
01:56:02;01:56:05;"and then vomiting up all this weird"
01:56:05;01:56:07;"topical medicine he had drank."
01:56:07;01:56:08;"- Oh."
01:56:08;01:56:09;"- Ever since then."
01:56:09;01:56:10;"No mustard."
01:56:10;01:56:11;"- Damn."
01:56:11;01:56:12;"And do you like mustard?"
01:56:12;01:56:13;"- Love it."
01:56:13;01:56:14;"- [laughs]"
01:56:14;01:56:17;"- It's a bit of a contentious issue within the house."
01:56:17;01:56:18;"- Even though you didn't have it?"
01:56:18;01:56:20;"- Grew to love it later."
01:56:20;01:56:21;"- Right."
01:56:21;01:56:22;"[laughs]"
01:56:22;01:56:24;"Man, you must have had some real [bleep] barbecues."
01:56:24;01:56:26;"- I know. Can you imagine?"
01:56:26;01:56:29;"- What'd you have? Just, like, ketchup and relish?"
01:56:29;01:56:31;"- I don't think we even did relish."
01:56:31;01:56:33;"- Just ketchup."
01:56:33;01:56:35;"- Man, you're a kid. That works."
01:56:35;01:56:37;"- Yeah, you're right. It works."
01:56:37;01:56:38;"- Oh."
01:56:38;01:56:40;"- Well, that was this week's top five."
01:56:40;01:56:41;"Extraordinary."
01:56:41;01:56:42;"- KLs."
01:56:42;01:56:44;"- Every generation has a KL."
01:56:44;01:56:47;"- I wonder what Loggins thinks of Kendrick."
01:56:47;01:56:48;"- He might--"
01:56:48;01:56:49;"- And vice versa."
01:56:49;01:56:52;"- I could imagine there being some mutual respect there."
01:56:52;01:56:53;"I think--"
01:56:53;01:56:54;"- Yeah."
01:56:54;01:56:56;"- Yeah, Kenny Loggins, I believe."
01:56:56;01:56:58;"I think he might live up in Santa Barbara or something."
01:56:58;01:56:59;"- That's tight."
01:56:59;01:57:01;"- Two SoCal guys."
01:57:01;01:57:02;"- That's tight."
01:57:02;01:57:03;"- [laughs]"
01:57:03;01:57:04;"Don't quote me on that."
01:57:04;01:57:06;"Anyway, that was a hell of a time crisis, Jake."
01:57:06;01:57:08;"We held it down."
01:57:08;01:57:10;"No guests, no Seinfeld 2000."
01:57:10;01:57:12;"Well, we did have Deezus on the phone."
01:57:12;01:57:14;"Thank you, Deezus, for calling in."
01:57:14;01:57:16;"No in-person guests and no Seinfeld 2000."
01:57:16;01:57:21;"All we had was our wits and the news."
01:57:21;01:57:22;"- And a lot of great tunes."
01:57:22;01:57:24;"- And a lot of great tunes."
01:57:24;01:57:26;"- And my ribs!"
01:57:28;01:57:31;"- I want my ribs to be the new ""In My Neighborhood."""
01:57:31;01:57:33;"- In my neighborhood, my ribs!"
01:57:33;01:57:35;"It's the end of a horrible rom-com."
01:57:35;01:57:38;"I guess they don't even really make those movies anymore."
01:57:38;01:57:39;"Or maybe they do."
01:57:39;01:57:41;"Jake, we just got word."
01:57:41;01:57:43;"Kendrick and Kenny Loggins almost certainly--"
01:57:43;01:57:45;"I'm not saying they've met each other,"
01:57:45;01:57:48;"but they're at most one degree of connection away."
01:57:48;01:57:49;"- Whoa."
01:57:49;01:57:52;"- They're literally both guests on the last ""Thundercat"" album,"
01:57:52;01:57:54;"which came out a couple months ago."
01:57:54;01:57:55;"- That's sick."
01:57:55;01:57:56;"- So you know what, man?"
01:57:56;01:57:58;"A lot of people think that Kendrick, Lamar, Kenny Loggins--"
01:57:58;01:58:00;"yeah, they have the same initials."
01:58:00;01:58:02;"They both have topped the charts."
01:58:02;01:58:04;"But what do they have to do with each other?"
01:58:04;01:58:05;"That's real close-minded."
01:58:05;01:58:06;"They have a lot to do with each other."
01:58:06;01:58:08;"They've even appeared on the same record."
01:58:08;01:58:10;"So shout-out to ""Thundercat,"" 'cause without you,"
01:58:10;01:58:13;"people might not understand that these guys aren't that different."
01:58:13;01:58:16;"And one last thing I want to say."
01:58:16;01:58:20;"Pepsi, take a good hard look in the mirror at what you've become."
01:58:20;01:58:23;"'Cause here in ""Time Crisis,"" we see the real you."
01:58:23;01:58:26;"You're a kitchen cola, a bargain brand."
01:58:26;01:58:28;"You're Brad's drink."
01:58:28;01:58:30;"And you know what? It's okay to be Brad's drink."
01:58:30;01:58:32;"Don't mess with things you don't understand."
01:58:32;01:58:33;"We'll see you in two weeks."
01:58:33;01:58:37;"- ""Time Crisis"" with Ezra King."
01:58:37;01:58:40;"Be-be-be-be-be-beasts."
01:58:40;01:58:41;"One."
01:58:41;01:58:43;"(explosion)"
