00:00;00:04;"Tom Crisis, New York City."
00:04;00:09;"A lot of my haters have suggested that I live in Los Angeles."
00:09;00:14;"Well guess what? I just did two episodes of my radio show in a row in New York City."
00:14;00:20;"This time I'm joined by despot Cousin Asher and Jonah Hill."
00:20;00:25;"We'll be talking about Harambe, 1999."
00:25;00:30;"Plus Jake Longstreth digs deeper into the world of Pepsi. This is..."
00:30;00:34;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:34;00:38;"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:38;00:44;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:44;00:51;"New Orleans, I felt a warming lean, on my right for chances."
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:58;01:02;"And so I dealt to the blow."
01:02;01:06;"What's up? Welcome to Time Crisis. Still in New York."
01:06;01:11;"I know a lot of my haters didn't think I'd do two Time Crises in New York City."
01:11;01:13;"But guess what? I'm still here."
01:13;01:14;"Very impressive, Ezra."
01:14;01:18;"Thank you. I'm here more than Jay-Z and Taylor Swift. That's what's important."
01:18;01:22;"I'm joined by my New York co-host, as always, Cousin Asher. What's up?"
01:22;01:23;"What's up, Ezra?"
01:23;01:25;"Also, despot. What's up, despot?"
01:25;01:26;"Hi, man."
01:26;01:30;"But the big news is one of the major New York homies, Jonah Hill, is in the building."
01:30;01:31;"What's up, Jonah?"
01:31;01:32;"Hey, man."
01:32;01:33;"Welcome back to Time Crisis."
01:33;01:34;"Such a pleasure."
01:34;01:35;"How's it going, dude?"
01:35;01:39;"Sometimes when I miss you guys, I listen to our episode when I was on before."
01:39;01:44;"I'm not even kidding around. I had so much fun that I just listened to it and it feels like hanging out with old friends."
01:44;01:47;"That's a lot of pressure. You gotta live up to that."
01:47;01:52;"We did discover that the emojis were blind people."
01:52;01:53;"Oh, yeah."
01:53;01:56;"And that was incredible because I hadn't thought about that since."
01:56;01:57;"Wait, wait. I don't remember that."
01:57;01:59;"Yeah, well, you can make it funnier."
01:59;02:01;"Oh, it says the emoji here."
02:01;02:02;"Fire."
02:03;02:06;"I don't know why we didn't move forward with that, using those as drop hints."
02:06;02:09;"Yeah, I was so expecting you guys to carry that on."
02:09;02:10;"Yeah, it's really great."
02:10;02:13;"Oh, wait. I still have them on the computer. Hold on."
02:13;02:14;"Yeah."
02:14;02:15;"Ancient Indian man with turban."
02:15;02:17;"Wait, that's crazy."
02:17;02:19;"Ancient Indian man with turban."
02:19;02:21;"Ancient Indian man with turban. I guess that's accurate."
02:21;02:22;"Clapping hands."
02:22;02:24;"No, they're prayer hands."
02:24;02:25;"Clapping hands."
02:25;02:26;"No."
02:26;02:27;"Dog."
02:28;02:32;"[laughter]"
02:32;02:34;"Happy face with sunglasses."
02:34;02:36;"That's how I feel most of the time."
02:36;02:37;"Happy face with sunglasses."
02:37;02:39;"This is a good one."
02:39;02:41;"A monkey that can hear no evil."
02:41;02:43;"[laughter]"
02:43;02:45;"So those are emoji for blind people."
02:45;02:46;"Yeah."
02:46;02:49;"A lot of people don't think about that, you know, like all these things we take for granted,"
02:49;02:52;"but that's cool that they translate them into something audio."
02:52;02:54;"Winking face with stuck-out tongue."
02:54;02:58;"To start things off, guys, I want to dust off an old segment we haven't done in a while."
02:58;03:00;"It's called New York News."
03:00;03:04;"This is New York News."
03:04;03:07;"So we're still here in New York."
03:07;03:09;"There's been a lot happening in New York."
03:09;03:17;"One big piece of news is that there's an ice cream gang in Midtown that's pushing Mr. Softee out."
03:17;03:18;"Damn."
03:18;03:23;"Yeah, New York Ice Cream, which started out as Mr. Softee Imposter, Master Softee."
03:23;03:25;"Yeah, I remember that."
03:25;03:26;"You remember Master Softee?"
03:26;03:27;"Yeah, Master Softee."
03:27;03:29;"That sounds like some Wu-Tang."
03:29;03:30;"Yeah."
03:30;03:34;"So New York Ice Cream was some, like, ice cream company that just came out and just ripped off Mr. Softee"
03:34;03:43;"with Master Softee trucks, and they've declared that 34th to 60th Street, River to River, that's ours."
03:43;03:48;"And meanwhile, Mr. Softee is reporting that if one of our drivers goes to Midtown,"
03:48;03:53;"these other guys bring their trucks in and surround them, and they'll start banging on the windows."
03:53;03:54;"Bullies."
03:54;03:56;"You will never see a Mr. Softee truck in Midtown."
03:56;03:59;"If you do, there will be problems, and you won't see him there very long."
03:59;04:05;"Master Softee looks so ill, though, I had to Google it up because I remember seeing what he looks like,"
04:05;04:07;"and now I'm looking at what he looks ill."
04:07;04:09;"What does Master Softee look like?"
04:09;04:10;"What, like the mascot on the side of the truck?"
04:10;04:12;"He's just like, ""What's up, Mr. Softee?"""
04:12;04:14;"Like, he's just like--"
04:14;04:18;"He looks like a pedophile with ice cream on top of his head."
04:18;04:23;"It's like Mr. Softee got roughed up a little bit, and he became Master Softee."
04:23;04:25;"Oh!"
04:25;04:28;"Everybody at home, Google ""Master Softee."""
04:28;04:30;"He's got rosacea."
04:30;04:33;"He's suffering from rosacea."
04:33;04:34;"He's very creepy looking."
04:34;04:35;"He's blotchy, for sure."
04:35;04:38;"My question is, what is this turf?"
04:38;04:41;"Like, who's getting ice cream on, like, 60th Street?"
04:41;04:42;"Kids, man."
04:42;04:43;"Midtown."
04:43;04:44;"Businessmen."
04:44;04:45;"Businessmen walking around like--"
04:45;04:47;"You don't see those guys in the park."
04:47;04:48;"Businessmen having a goof."
04:48;04:52;"You don't see a midday goof, and they just grab themselves an ice cream cone?"
04:52;04:54;"I did actually do that last week, I'm not going to lie."
04:54;04:55;"Yeah, you're a businessman."
04:55;04:57;"Yeah, you see those guys like--"
04:57;04:58;"I'm a businessman."
04:58;05:00;"Yeah, licking ice cream cones together."
05:00;05:03;"The little Wall Street type guys."
05:03;05:04;"Oh, that definitely happens."
05:04;05:07;"Yeah, you're supposed to knock the cone out of their hand."
05:07;05:10;"Like a skateboarder goes down the street and knocks it out of their hand."
05:10;05:11;"What do you mean you're supposed to?"
05:11;05:12;"That's what bad kids do?"
05:12;05:13;"It's the rule, yeah."
05:13;05:14;"You used to do that?"
05:14;05:15;"Nah."
05:15;05:18;"That's just like the rule, you're just supposed to."
05:18;05:19;"Anytime you see somebody--"
05:19;05:21;"It doesn't matter what kind of kid you are."
05:21;05:23;"But you do it to a grown up."
05:23;05:27;"You see a grown up in a suit eating an ice cream cone, what do you feel like doing?"
05:27;05:29;"Saying hi to them?"
05:29;05:30;"Grow up."
05:30;05:31;"Okay, I mean, yeah."
05:31;05:33;"It is true that I've done that before, I've gotten ice cream by myself,"
05:33;05:37;"and people look like you're completely insane."
05:37;05:41;"It's really the craziest thing you can do in the city is walk around just eating an ice cream by yourself."
05:41;05:42;"I've done it."
05:42;05:43;"No social excuse whatsoever."
05:43;05:50;"We got ice cream the other night, and I put my cone in a cup because I felt real weird just licking an ice cream cone"
05:50;05:53;"walking down the street."
05:53;05:54;"It's like holding a cotton candy or something."
05:54;05:57;"You don't want to eat a banana walking around, you don't want to do that."
05:57;06:01;"Or if you do it, you want to break it off with your hand and pop the piece in your mouth."
06:01;06:04;"I have my mom cut mine up into little chunks."
06:04;06:05;"Yeah, put it in a bag."
06:05;06:07;"Oh, this is a lot of bad."
06:07;06:10;"Then she gets it all brown."
06:10;06:13;"I got an ice cream cone before I came here."
06:13;06:14;"Or I just have her just mash it."
06:14;06:18;"The other day--I guess that was last night, you got ice cream."
06:18;06:20;"Yeah."
06:20;06:21;"We just went to the bodega."
06:21;06:24;"How many ice cream cones you taking down a week?"
06:24;06:26;"I got ice cream with you like three nights ago."
06:26;06:29;"I've taken down on average one and a half a day."
06:29;06:30;"No, I didn't get one yesterday."
06:30;06:32;"Yesterday I was with Despot."
06:32;06:33;"I had a little Haagen-Dazs bar."
06:33;06:35;"I thought that was adding character for you, honestly."
06:35;06:38;"It was, but somebody was talking about ice cream."
06:38;06:39;"I got a question."
06:39;06:41;"Despot, you're a tough guy."
06:41;06:43;"Yeah."
06:43;06:44;"You do P90X."
06:44;06:45;"Yeah, just finish."
06:45;06:46;"You work out."
06:46;06:47;"Yeah."
06:47;06:49;"What's the toughest ice cream?"
06:49;06:51;"Or is that a paradox?"
06:51;06:53;"Yeah, well, I mean, it depends."
06:53;06:55;"I think it's more about how it's served."
06:55;06:58;"Like a cone, you're licking that cone."
06:58;06:59;"That's not cool."
06:59;07:02;"If it's in a cup, you're just taking little spoonfuls of it."
07:02;07:03;"It's fine."
07:03;07:04;"Don't get too crazy with the flavor."
07:04;07:06;"Chocolate or vanilla."
07:06;07:07;"Really?"
07:07;07:09;"Yeah, strawberry I would stay away from."
07:09;07:10;"Really?"
07:10;07:14;"What about those like strawberry shortcake or toasted almond?"
07:14;07:15;"That's tough."
07:15;07:16;"That's cool."
07:16;07:17;"That's what I'm talking about."
07:17;07:18;"The humor is cool."
07:18;07:19;"That's fine."
07:19;07:20;"That's very cool."
07:20;07:21;"Hey, I got a dumb question."
07:21;07:22;"Jonah, you grew up in LA."
07:22;07:23;"Yeah."
07:23;07:24;"They have ice cream trucks in LA?"
07:24;07:25;"Yeah, they do."
07:25;07:26;"Parks."
07:26;07:27;"Lots of parks."
07:27;07:32;"When I would play like, you know, European soccer at my park."
07:32;07:33;"At my local park growing up?"
07:33;07:34;"When you played European soccer?"
07:34;07:35;"I mean, European football."
07:35;07:38;"European soccer is American football."
07:38;07:42;"You know, like people like, when people are on the radio, they always say European football"
07:42;07:44;"instead of soccer."
07:44;07:48;"When I would play like sports in the park, they would have the ice cream man and the"
07:48;07:53;"song always sounded like, it was like, it was all weird."
07:53;07:56;"That was like some G-Funk."
07:56;07:57;"It wasn't."
07:57;08:01;"[Singing]"
08:01;08:03;"Yeah, but it sounded like in a horror movie."
08:03;08:07;"The one, you know, like when it's like, it was all slowed down."
08:07;08:08;"He was like hand cranking it."
08:08;08:10;"There was a guy in the back."
08:10;08:12;"It was like on lean."
08:12;08:14;"It was like chopped and screwed."
08:14;08:15;"Chopped and screwed."
08:15;08:16;"Yeah, it was like."
08:16;08:18;"But these were like parked."
08:18;08:22;"And it was like Metro Boomin wants some ice cream."
08:22;08:26;"But they were parked at, but what about like, I don't know."
08:26;08:27;"They were on the move."
08:27;08:28;"Then they would drive by my house and stuff like that."
08:28;08:29;"And you would hear the song."
08:29;08:30;"Yeah."
08:30;08:32;"And you would like run out with some cash."
08:32;08:37;"Yeah, I went to like, you know, I was like a counselor at this camp and I went to this"
08:37;08:41;"like local park near my house and like it would come once a day in the summer and like"
08:41;08:43;"all the kids would get ice cream."
08:43;08:47;"Were there specific, the way it is in New York, you know, where there's like Mr. Softee"
08:47;08:50;"is the staple and Master Softee obviously was there."
08:50;08:52;"Is also a staple."
08:52;08:56;"Were there obvious like brands of ice cream?"
08:56;09:02;"They were kind of cool because my neighborhood, like, like there's a lot of like Latino influence"
09:02;09:03;"in Los Angeles."
09:03;09:06;"So a lot of them were like Mexican style ice cream."
09:06;09:07;"Senor Softee."
09:07;09:09;"Yeah, like the flavors would be like."
09:09;09:10;"Coco helado."
09:10;09:14;"Yeah, they would just be with Spanish names, which is kind of cool."
09:14;09:19;"Oh, also, I want to urge the young people of New York, like instead of knocking it out"
09:19;09:24;"of a businessman's hand, it'd be way funnier to mush it in his face when he was taking"
09:24;09:25;"a bite."
09:25;09:28;"Yeah, like that's if you're going to assault like a stranger with ice cream cone, like"
09:28;09:30;"at least mash it in his face."
09:30;09:32;"Get the cone stuck on his nose."
09:32;09:37;"So he really has to deal with his choice of getting that ice cream cone for the rest of"
09:37;09:38;"the day."
09:38;09:41;"Another day to show a badass baby kid."
09:41;09:44;"Always want to get the 50 cent ice cream."
09:44;09:45;"Skip."
09:45;09:46;"Get the $2 ice cream."
09:46;09:48;"Broke ass little skip."
09:48;09:49;"Hate going through this."
09:49;09:51;"Get a glass neperon."
09:51;09:53;"Uh, ay."
09:53;09:55;"Diamonds on a hand nigga necklace."
09:55;09:57;"Yeah, that's ice, ice water."
09:57;09:59;"I just get the niggas that call me."
09:59;10:01;"Dunkin' till the vents caught up."
10:01;10:03;"I just get the niggas that call me."
10:03;10:05;"Cause they know I hand the neck."
10:05;10:07;"Lil Yachty in the flesh."
10:07;10:09;"I keep diamonds on my neck."
10:09;10:13;"Ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, water."
10:13;10:15;"All these diamonds on my wrist."
10:15;10:17;"Got these bitches getting sick."
10:17;10:19;"Everybody know I'm next."
10:19;10:21;"So they hating on the goodness."
10:21;10:23;"Ice, ice, ice, water."
10:25;10:29;"Ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, water."
10:29;10:31;"Both my bitches your daughter."
10:31;10:33;"Did it once, do it twice."
10:33;10:35;"All these punches in my dick cause I'm rich."
10:35;10:37;"I'm a nigga that ain't nice."
10:37;10:39;"This nigga loving me again."
10:39;10:41;"This nigga love a rich nigga again."
10:41;10:45;"Daniel Bo, Daniel Bo, you always come through here with all these diamonds on your neck."
10:45;10:47;"So, you're listening to..."
10:47;10:52;"Time Crisis on Beat 1."

11:14;11:16;"I'm still here, dog."
11:16;11:18;"How did I finesse all of this from Jane and Weston?"
11:18;11:22;"Girls all in my bed and they don't trip on first impression."
11:22;11:26;"Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions."
11:26;11:29;"I can't... with you no more cause you be acting extra."
11:29;11:32;"Favorite rapper like my son, like my son, no."
11:32;11:36;"Nothing mutual about my funds, about my funds, though."
11:36;11:39;"All you... fighting over crumbs, where the bread at?"
11:39;11:43;"How they feel about you, where you from, where your bed at?"
11:43;11:45;"I don't need no pill to speak my mind."
11:45;11:47;"I don't need that."
11:47;11:49;"I make people pay me for my time."
11:49;11:50;"Yeah, I need that."
11:50;11:54;"And I see your girl like all the time, all the time, no."
11:54;11:57;"I can't tell you if she's yours or mine, but I do know."

12:15;12:19;"Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog."
12:19;12:22;"I thought that we were family."
12:22;12:25;"You showed me that we can be."
12:25;12:29;"I got to talk to God even though he isn't near me."
12:29;12:32;"Based on what I got, it's hard to think that he don't hear me."
12:32;12:36;"Hitting like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted."
12:36;12:40;"Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like, hallelujah, hallelujah,"

13:17;13:19;"I'm here now, no, they been waiting for me."
13:19;13:21;"Since I was 15, now I'm yellow."
13:21;13:23;"100 miles and running, uh."
13:23;13:26;"Easy coming, easy good is why I work the midnight."
13:26;13:29;"I'm out of town, shirty, very dirty on the turnpike."
13:29;13:32;"My... clean, I call the case of heavens to the best."
13:32;13:36;"The lawyer said don't smoke, I'm like good love, Buddha keep me blessed."
13:36;13:38;"I'm buying Nike stock when I see these checks."
13:38;13:40;"Motivated by... because it's bigger than me."
13:40;13:42;"I know that I might go back to my old..."
13:42;13:44;"Bring the pro back, that's a throwback."
13:44;13:46;"Yeah, watch your mouth."
13:46;13:47;"Try to talk like you know something."
13:47;13:50;"My competition is myself, therefore I ain't worry about no one."
13:50;13:53;"Not a soul, pot of gold, looking like a stain."
13:53;13:55;"Sucking and wet your mind, see you behind yourself."
13:55;13:57;"You playing catch up, boy, is that your blood?"
13:57;14:01;"'Cause I done blew inside my mind since I first wrote a rhyme."
14:01;14:03;"You're all late, rappers be stuck in the booth."
14:03;14:04;"I'm off state."
14:04;14:06;"Damn pop, the steak and lobster serve my turf."
14:06;14:10;"And the way I chop it next to Oprah at the opera, okay."
14:10;14:15;"If you had everything you ever wanted right in front of me,"
14:15;14:17;"what's it gonna be?"
14:17;14:19;"Lights or the drums or the girls?"
14:19;14:22;"Finally drives me crazy."
14:22;14:25;"Drives me crazy."
14:25;14:29;"Drives me crazy."
14:29;14:32;"Drives me crazy."
14:32;14:36;"Drives me crazy."
14:36;14:39;"Gotta love it though they hatin', homie."
14:39;14:42;"I be on Sunset, still go back to '68, the stony."
14:42;14:46;"Cooked out my basement, drop my tape and get my homies placements."
14:46;14:49;"I play the keys in my sleep on the beach, that's a dream vacation."
14:49;14:52;"Say you ain't heard, I'll let you lie, just know you dig your grave."
14:52;14:55;"No turning backwards, you don't find it, that's the hand you play."
14:55;14:58;"Game over on the driving range and the Range Rover halfway sober."
14:58;15:00;"But when I'm in it, finger up, I'm about decent."
15:00;15:04;"We're all talking agenda, middle of the summer with the wood on me and the feet for the snow."
15:04;15:06;"She a thief in the blood, I'm a G to the co."
15:06;15:09;"You know me, I need Kiki Palmer off TSA for that T.O.P."
15:09;15:11;"P's to the G, P and a D to the bow."
15:11;15:14;"Y'all crazy, y'all losing, I make pop music, still the king with the flow."
15:14;15:16;"This just shit I've been thinking about, uh."
15:16;15:22;"Picture everything you ever want, want, want, want right in front of you."
15:22;15:29;"Ooh, the lights of the clubs, the girls, finally drives me crazy."
15:29;15:49;"Drives me crazy."
15:49;16:12;"Whoa."
16:26;16:29;"Should we talk about this gorilla?"
16:29;16:30;"I'd like to talk about it."
16:30;16:32;"It's kind of old news, but you know what it really is."
16:32;16:34;"It's a complicated situation though."
16:34;16:37;"I wasn't on Twitter that much in the days that it happened, which I'm kind of thankful for."
16:37;16:41;"But basically, I'm sure everybody's familiar with this."
16:41;16:44;"A child slipped into a gorilla pen at the zoo."
16:44;16:45;"Yep."
16:45;16:47;"And they shot the gorilla to protect the child."
16:47;16:48;"Silverback."
16:48;16:49;"Oh, it was a silverback?"
16:49;16:50;"Highly endangered, yeah."
16:50;16:51;"Oh, it was endangered?"
16:51;16:52;"Yeah, highly endangered."
16:52;16:54;"And the gorilla had a name, Harambe."
16:54;16:55;"Yeah."
16:55;17:03;"But the complicated thing was that based on the video, it was very unclear whether or not it was hurting the kid"
17:03;17:05;"or protecting the kid from the other gorillas."
17:05;17:11;"So there were a lot of people saying that it was watching over it like a parent, and they actually have evidence"
17:11;17:16;"they just found now of, I don't know if it was the same gorilla, but another gorilla in the '90s who did the same thing,"
17:16;17:22;"who protected a child that got in from all the other gorillas and got it back to safety."
17:22;17:25;"So now they're saying killed a hero."
17:25;17:26;"It's complicated."
17:26;17:27;"That man on fire."
17:27;17:28;"And endangered."
17:28;17:29;"Yeah, exactly."
17:29;17:30;"[Laughter]"
17:30;17:32;"Well, that's a calculated risk."
17:32;17:33;"All right."
17:33;17:35;"Jonah, what's your take on this?"
17:35;17:36;"Man."
17:36;17:38;"I know you've been doing interviews about this all week, but, you know."
17:38;17:40;"You know, I've tried to stay off this topic."
17:40;17:42;"No, I'm a big animal rights dude."
17:42;17:48;"I think it's so sad that they killed this gorilla for being a gorilla, even if he wasn't."
17:48;17:52;"Okay, I'll just say this because I've read a lot about this."
17:52;18:00;"People are blaming the parents for not watching their kid hard enough, and the kid gets in the gorilla pen, right?"
18:00;18:02;"Yeah."
18:02;18:04;"And then there's all these different sides that are coming under fire."
18:04;18:09;"Then there's people blaming the zoo for killing the gorilla and the zoo for making it."
18:09;18:19;"I kind of fall on the side of, like, be mad at the zoo in a way because it shouldn't be that easy for a kid to get into a gorilla pen."
18:19;18:20;"So I think that's kind of the error."
18:20;18:22;"They said it never happened before, but."
18:22;18:26;"I mean, if it's even possible, like, that's just crazy."
18:26;18:30;"Because of the skinniest four-year-old in the world, he just got in between those bars."
18:30;18:32;"No one else that ever been able to do that."
18:32;18:33;"Or they should have a guard or something."
18:33;18:34;"You know what I mean?"
18:34;18:36;"Like, and I don't know."
18:36;18:39;"I think if it's the parents, it's like, whatever."
18:39;18:40;"Everyone, I don't have kids."
18:40;18:41;"So I don't know."
18:41;18:46;"Maybe you look away for a second and the kids all of a sudden, your kid's like, and they're with a bunch of gorillas."
18:46;18:47;"Like, that sucks."
18:47;18:50;"And it sucks for the gorilla to get yoked out."
18:50;18:51;"Like, and that's sad."
18:51;18:54;"But the kids shouldn't be able to get into."
18:54;18:56;"I think that's like the source of the problem."
18:56;18:57;"That was the original crime."
18:57;19:02;"Yeah, and it's also not like they took their kid to the jungle and the kid went to the gorilla."
19:02;19:03;"No, it's Cincinnati."
19:03;19:06;"But a zoo is a place that people take kids."
19:06;19:07;"Yeah."
19:07;19:09;"So you would think they'd have extra security."
19:09;19:20;"But I guess, you know, I guess it kind of like, I think like PETA would say it's the zoo's fault, not for having bad security, but for existing in the first place."
19:20;19:27;"Like the hardcore animal rights PETA line would be like, why are we caging noble beasts in Cincinnati in the first place?"
19:27;19:28;"Right."
19:28;19:29;"So why is there a zoo for even existing?"
19:29;19:30;"Exactly."
19:30;19:33;"And then the answer would be the zoo's for the kids."
19:33;19:37;"And then it'd be like, well, look what happened to the kids."
19:37;19:40;"And then, you know, it's just a circular argument."
19:40;19:41;"It's a, what do you call it?"
19:41;19:43;"A snake that's eating itself?"
19:43;19:44;"Or a gorilla."
19:44;19:48;"So it makes you think, should zoos exist at all?"
19:48;19:51;"Despot, you pro zoo?"
19:51;19:53;"I used to go to Bronx Zoo a lot myself."
19:53;19:56;"I remember my dad took me to Staten Island Zoo a bunch."
19:56;19:58;"I'm not sure why, because it was like."
19:58;19:59;"I never heard about that one."
19:59;20:00;"Yeah, kind of dinky zoo."
20:00;20:02;"What about Brooklyn Zoo?"
20:02;20:05;"No, but I like the song."
20:05;20:09;"And Queens has a zoo that was right across the street from my house, actually, in Flushing Middle Park."
20:09;20:10;"New York's incredible."
20:10;20:11;"Every borough has a zoo."
20:11;20:12;"Yeah."
20:12;20:13;"So I don't know."
20:13;20:19;"I'll say I liked the zoos as a kid, but I do remember seeing a panther in a zoo once."
20:19;20:21;"I think it was the Staten Island Zoo."
20:21;20:25;"And it was just pacing back and forth on this little branch in this little cage."
20:25;20:27;"And I was like, Dad, what's up with that panther?"
20:27;20:28;"Why is he just doing that?"
20:28;20:30;"And my dad was like, it's depressed."
20:30;20:32;"And I was like, well, he's probably right."
20:32;20:33;"Why is the panther depressed?"
20:33;20:34;"And he's like, because it's in a little cage."
20:34;20:36;"And I was like, oh, yeah, that sucks."
20:36;20:38;"And then I didn't really like zoos anymore."
20:38;20:41;"He did the same thing to me with GI Joe's."
20:41;20:44;"Wait, what about GI Joe's?"
20:44;20:46;"Maybe GI Joe's not that cool."
20:46;20:47;"Yeah, my parents never let me have GI Joe's."
20:47;20:48;"They thought it was too violent."
20:48;20:52;"But they let me have Ninja Turtles, which is really big for kids."
20:52;20:53;"And it's back once again."
20:53;20:57;"So I know very little about guns."
20:57;20:58;"I know very little about firearms."
20:58;21:00;"But I'm very familiar with Psy."
21:00;21:01;"Yeah."
21:01;21:02;"Bosaf."
21:02;21:06;"And pizzas with the crazy flavors on them, like jelly beans."
21:06;21:09;"I was in an Uber coming here."
21:09;21:14;"And a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles promo commercial came on the radio."
21:14;21:18;"And whichever turtle was talking said, ""Boo-yak-a-sha."""
21:18;21:20;"The turtles don't say that."
21:20;21:21;"I couldn't even imagine."
21:21;21:22;"Say Cowabunga."

21:38;21:39;"Where you found them at?"
21:39;21:40;"Got 'em round town."
21:40;21:41;"Could've drowned in it."
21:41;21:44;"Would've floated, bloated, voted, sugar-coated, loaded, hip shooter."

35:24;35:39;"- All right guys, I gotta check in"
35:39;35:42;"with our West Coast correspondent now, Jake Longstreth."
35:42;35:45;"He's been up in the library doing a lot of research for us"
35:45;35:49;"about the fast food industry and specifically PepsiCo."
35:49;35:53;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
35:53;35:56;"(phone ringing)"
35:56;35:58;"- What's up Ezra?"
35:58;36:00;"- Yo Jake, how you living man?"
36:00;36:03;"- Pretty good, pretty good, how are you?"
36:03;36:05;"- I'm good, still out here in New York."
36:05;36:06;"How's it going in LA?"
36:06;36:09;"- Pretty solid man, I had my show open on Sunday"
36:09;36:11;"at LTD Gallery."
36:11;36:14;"- Oh congrats, I wanna see that when I'm back in town."
36:14;36:16;"- Yeah, yeah, you gotta swing by."
36:16;36:17;"For all our listeners out there,"
36:17;36:21;"that's a solo painting exhibition I just opened"
36:21;36:25;"on Sunday at LTD Gallery in LA on Sunset"
36:25;36:26;"near the Guitar Center."
36:26;36:29;"- A lot of people don't know that in addition"
36:29;36:32;"to being a radio personality, Jake is a sick painter,"
36:32;36:36;"but also a researcher of fast food history."
36:36;36:42;"The past couple shows, Jake, you've been teaching us a lot"
36:42;36:45;"about the history behind some of these products"
36:45;36:46;"that we enjoy a lot."
36:46;36:48;"We started out by talking about Fritos vs. Lay's,"
36:48;36:51;"then we got into the history of the Frito-Lay company."
36:51;36:54;"So I'm just wondering man, this is kind of becoming"
36:54;36:57;"like our fast food segment, what do you got for us this week?"
36:57;36:59;"- If you recall last week we were talking"
36:59;37:00;"about Donald Kendall."
37:00;37:02;"- The former CEO of PepsiCo?"
37:02;37:05;"- Yeah, PepsiCo as you remember was founded in '65."
37:05;37:08;"It was the merger of Pepsi and Frito-Lay's."
37:08;37:10;"And I told you that story about him being tight"
37:10;37:13;"with Nixon and then bringing in that phone call"
37:13;37:16;"to try to oust Allende from Chile."
37:16;37:18;"So I was intrigued by Donald Kendall and I was like,"
37:18;37:20;"I bet there's more to this Donald Kendall story."
37:20;37:22;"And it turns out there is."
37:22;37:25;"- All right, so Donald Kendall, CEO of PepsiCo,"
37:25;37:26;"tell us more about him."
37:26;37:29;"- This is like some very madman,"
37:29;37:32;"kind of man in a gray flannel suit kind of stuff."
37:32;37:35;"Born in 1921 on a family dairy farm"
37:35;37:37;"in rural Washington state."
37:37;37:40;"He goes through World War II, he's shot down"
37:40;37:42;"near the Philippines, narrowly survives,"
37:42;37:44;"comes back to the United States,"
37:44;37:47;"and then by like a year or two after the war,"
37:47;37:51;"he's working for Pepsi-Cola as a marketer and a salesman."
37:51;37:53;"And so it's like an amazing kind of image"
37:53;37:56;"to think about what sort of existential position"
37:56;37:59;"he was coming from, of like going from this"
37:59;38:02;"life-threatening, harrowing experience in war"
38:02;38:05;"to like being a soda salesman."
38:05;38:07;"- Shot down by Japanese soldiers"
38:07;38:09;"in the Pacific theater of World War II."
38:09;38:11;"- I was reading this interview with him today,"
38:11;38:12;"he was just like bobbing around the ocean"
38:12;38:14;"and it's just like, it's just funny."
38:14;38:15;"So it's from that--"
38:15;38:16;"- American history psycho."
38:16;38:18;"So yeah, he's bobbing in the ocean by the Philippines,"
38:18;38:23;"narrowly survives the craziest war the world has ever seen,"
38:23;38:25;"then he comes back to America"
38:25;38:27;"and gets a job marketing sugar water."
38:27;38:28;"- Yep."
38:28;38:29;"- Love it."
38:29;38:31;"- Now who knows how much of this military experience"
38:31;38:35;"really informed his fervent and aggressive patriotism"
38:35;38:37;"that he brought as a soda salesman."
38:37;38:40;"So what happens after World War II in the Western Europe"
38:40;38:42;"is that Coca-Cola gets in there"
38:42;38:44;"immediately."
38:44;38:46;"They lock that down from a market perspective."
38:46;38:50;"But in 1959, years after the war has ended,"
38:50;38:53;"the US is engaged in a cold war with Russia"
38:53;38:55;"and there's no soda market over there."
38:55;39:00;"And Eisenhower is eager to open up relations with Russia"
39:00;39:03;"and Khrushchev, the leader of Soviet Union at the time"
39:03;39:07;"and Richard Nixon, who is VP of Eisenhower,"
39:07;39:09;"organized the first American trade exhibition ever"
39:09;39:10;"in the Soviet Union."
39:10;39:12;"It was called the American National Exhibition."
39:12;39:14;"- Oh, I've heard that's a famous one"
39:14;39:16;"where they're kind of standing next to each other"
39:16;39:17;"and Khrushchev is,"
39:17;39:19;"they're kind of like being catty with each other."
39:19;39:20;"- Yes."
39:20;39:23;"And so apparently the night before the thing started,"
39:23;39:25;"Kendall is there representing Pepsi."
39:25;39:27;"Like Pepsi has a trade booth."
39:27;39:29;"And he goes up to Nixon and he's sort of just like,"
39:29;39:31;"""Dude, how can we work this out"
39:31;39:33;"so you bring Khrushchev over"
39:33;39:35;"and I get a Pepsi in his hand?"
39:35;39:36;"We need to make that happen."""
39:36;39:38;"And sure enough, it does the next day."
39:38;39:39;"Nixon leads Khrushchev over"
39:39;39:43;"and there's like an iconic photo of him holding a Pepsi."
39:43;39:44;"And from there on,"
39:44;39:47;"Pepsi becomes associated with the Soviet Union."
39:47;39:48;"- So there's no Coke,"
39:48;39:51;"there's no Coca-Cola in the Soviet Union,"
39:51;39:54;"but Pepsi gets in there first using the Nixon connection."
39:54;39:55;"- Exactly."
39:55;39:58;"And in 1972, they strike a barter agreement"
39:58;40:01;"where PepsiCo is granted the exportation"
40:01;40:04;"and marketing rights to Stoling Naya,"
40:04;40:06;"also known as Stoli Vodka,"
40:06;40:09;"which is like the state Soviet vodka company."
40:09;40:11;"- Oh, I didn't know that."
40:11;40:12;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
40:12;40:16;"So PepsiCo becomes the sole importer of Stoli Vodka."
40:16;40:18;"And in exchange,"
40:18;40:21;"the Soviet Union markets and sells Pepsi Cola."
40:21;40:23;"And it's literally a barter exchange"
40:23;40:28;"where Pepsi Cola syrup is being traded"
40:28;40:30;"for flats of Stoli Vodka."
40:30;40:32;"- That doesn't sound very communist."
40:32;40:33;"- No."
40:33;40:35;"I mean, but yeah,"
40:35;40:38;"so like the Soviet Union is selling Pepsi Cola."
40:38;40:40;"- So like the one American product"
40:40;40:42;"in the Soviet Union is Pepsi."
40:42;40:44;"- It's the first US company ever"
40:44;40:46;"to have its product there under the US government."
40:46;40:47;"- And let's just clarify for the listeners,"
40:47;40:51;"we're not talking about like late '80s fall of communism."
40:51;40:54;"We're talking about '60s full-on Cold War."
40:54;40:54;"- Full-on."
40:54;40:56;"- And this dude, Donald Kendall,"
40:56;40:58;"got Pepsi into the Soviet Union."
40:58;40:59;"- Yes, he did."
40:59;41:00;"- Wow."
41:00;41:01;"- This was in the early '70s."
41:01;41:01;"And then of course,"
41:01;41:04;"it ends up sort of backfiring in the sense that"
41:04;41:07;"in '92 when the Soviet Union collapses,"
41:07;41:10;"all the people there associate Pepsi with the old regime."
41:10;41:11;"- Oh."
41:11;41:14;"- Coke comes in there like the day after"
41:14;41:16;"and just sets up shop."
41:16;41:17;"And as of today,"
41:17;41:21;"Coke enjoys a 20% market share and Pepsi only 13."
41:21;41:22;"'Cause people are like,"
41:22;41:24;"""Pepsi is the old communist stuff."""
41:24;41:24;"- That's amazing."
41:24;41:26;"Like, yeah, 'cause Pepsi was always,"
41:26;41:28;"Pepsi in America was always marketed"
41:28;41:31;"as like the fresh, youthful alternative to Coke."
41:31;41:32;"- Right."
41:32;41:33;"- But in Soviet Union,"
41:33;41:38;"Pepsi-Cola is associated with totalitarian communism."
41:38;41:39;"- Right, right, yeah."
41:39;41:42;"The Pepsi marketing of like the next generation"
41:42;41:45;"or like whatever that was didn't fly over there."
41:45;41:46;"And then I love this."
41:46;41:51;"Vladimir Putin gave Kendall a Order of Friendship Award,"
41:51;41:54;"which is the highest civilian honor in 2004."
41:54;41:56;"And there's like amazing photos I found of Putin"
41:56;41:59;"and like a really old at that point, Donald Kendall."
41:59;42:00;"- Oh my God."
42:00;42:02;"I'm sure some dudes are probably like,"
42:02;42:03;"""You're doing business with the commies."""
42:03;42:04;"But I bet in his head, he was like,"
42:04;42:05;"""You know what?"
42:05;42:10;"By providing delicious Pepsi to these communists,"
42:10;42:13;"we're actually like making inroads for capitalism."""
42:13;42:15;"He probably believed he was doing God's work."
42:15;42:16;"- Absolutely."
42:16;42:17;"I mean, that one, yeah."
42:17;42:18;"I mean, the story I told you before"
42:18;42:23;"about him trying to get the president of Chile overthrown"
42:23;42:25;"was a little more sinister."
42:25;42:29;"This one was like a little more like by the book Cold War"
42:29;42:30;"in the sense of, yeah,"
42:30;42:34;"he was trying to import like powerful American brands."
42:34;42:37;"I'm sure his experience as a soldier in World War II"
42:37;42:40;"informed this like really ambitious"
42:40;42:44;"and patriotic way of conducting business,"
42:44;42:46;"which to us seems like kind of funny"
42:46;42:50;"and like hard to imagine that mindset today."
42:50;42:51;"- In the global economy."
42:51;42:52;"- Right, right."
42:52;42:54;"- Well, that's a crazy story, Jake."
42:54;42:58;"So for everybody at home, next time you sip on a Pepsi,"
42:59;43:00;"(Jake laughs)"
43:00;43:04;"just imagine that you're in the Soviet Union."
43:04;43:06;"You waited in line for that Pepsi"
43:06;43:09;"and you walked into a store"
43:09;43:12;"and you didn't get to choose what soda you drank"
43:12;43:13;"and they handed you a Pepsi."
43:13;43:16;"- Yeah, it was Pepsi."
43:16;43:19;"- And then go drink a Coke and see how that makes you feel."
43:19;43:22;"Jake, thank you so much for this incredible research"
43:22;43:26;"about the intersection of the Cola Wars and the Cold War."
43:26;43:27;"That makes me think that maybe we should listen"
43:27;43:30;"to a little song by Billy Joel called ""We Didn't Start the Fire"""
43:30;43:31;"because he references the Cola Wars."

50:12;50:13;"You guys having fun?"
50:13;50:14;"- Woo-woo."
50:14;50:15;"- Loving it."
50:15;50:16;"- Yes."
50:16;50:18;"- So, speaking of woo-woo,"
50:18;50:21;"I was watching a Insane Clown Posse documentary today."
50:21;50:22;"- Oh, really?"
50:22;50:23;"- Yeah. - American Juggalo?"
50:23;50:24;"- Yeah."
50:24;50:26;"But then I watched it and found like a more bootleg one"
50:26;50:28;"that wasn't as like well-made."
50:29;50:32;"- You think if I were to make a film,"
50:32;50:35;"like a Spinal Tap, but with juggalos,"
50:35;50:38;"would enough people understand the humor of that?"
50:38;50:40;"Or is it so niche that like,"
50:40;50:41;"I'm obsessed with this culture."
50:41;50:42;"- You know."
50:42;50:43;"- I feel like everyone knows about it."
50:43;50:47;"- I feel like you should do the drama version."
50:47;50:47;"- Of that."
50:47;50:50;"- I've seen like kind of parodies of Juggalo culture."
50:50;50:51;"I've seen spoofs,"
50:51;50:54;"but I've never seen like one about like the real like drama."
50:54;50:55;"Like what's going on in Ohio?"
50:55;50:58;"- It would almost work better if like a character in a movie,"
50:58;51:01;"like the brother of a (beep) up family,"
51:01;51:02;"one was a juggalo."
51:02;51:03;"- Yeah."
51:03;51:05;"- Meaning instead of the whole movie's about like juggalo"
51:05;51:07;"culture and stuff like that."
51:07;51:10;"Like a main character of a film being a juggalo,"
51:10;51:12;"like in his life,"
51:12;51:14;"but other people in the film aren't all juggalos."
51:14;51:16;"- I know this girl who went to Yale"
51:16;51:20;"and like started dating this guy who also went to Yale"
51:20;51:22;"and was like a smart guy,"
51:22;51:25;"like getting his master's in some kind of art stuff"
51:25;51:28;"and grew up being a Trekkie,"
51:28;51:30;"because his dad was like a hardcore Trekkie"
51:30;51:31;"and would dress up him and his brother"
51:31;51:33;"and bring him to conventions or whatever."
51:33;51:35;"- That means a fan of Star Trek."
51:35;51:36;"- Yes."
51:36;51:37;"And then a fanatic you might say."
51:37;51:38;"- A fanatic."
51:38;51:42;"- But then as an adult in Yale,"
51:42;51:44;"he was a juggalo and he was just like a dude"
51:44;51:46;"who's like a smart dude who's a juggalo."
51:46;51:48;"And she told me that and was like,"
51:48;51:49;"what do you think about that?"
51:49;51:50;"Is that weird?"
51:50;51:52;"And I was like, yeah,"
51:52;51:53;"absolutely weird."
51:53;51:55;"'Cause you have to be an idiot to be a juggalo."
51:55;51:56;"- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
51:56;51:58;"No, you know what though?"
51:58;52:00;"That's not, I don't think,"
52:00;52:02;"I feel like I've listened probably to enough"
52:02;52:05;"insane clown posse to say that that's not even an insult."
52:05;52:08;"I feel like that's the manifesto of the juggalo."
52:08;52:11;"- But then if you watch American Juggalo,"
52:11;52:12;"it's kind of, it's very moving"
52:12;52:15;"because it's a lot of people like finding community."
52:15;52:17;"It's very emotional kind of,"
52:17;52:19;"but it's just very,"
52:19;52:19;"- It's idiots finding each other."
52:19;52:22;"- It's a very crazy subculture."
52:22;52:25;"Like it's very idiosyncratic subculture."
52:25;52:28;"Like it's so out there."
52:28;52:30;"- Those guys definitely have a sense of humor."
52:30;52:34;"It's kind of hard to tell if they take it seriously or not."
52:34;52:37;"- They just made their own comedy films."
52:37;52:38;"- I didn't know that."
52:38;52:40;"- There is something like weirdly smart,"
52:40;52:42;"like the Miracles music video."
52:42;52:44;"Remember that, that crazy video?"
52:44;52:44;"- With magnets."
52:44;52:46;"- Magnets, what are they?"
52:46;52:47;"Like all of those things."
52:47;52:49;"Like it's so dumb that it's actually kind of,"
52:49;52:51;"like they made their own Spinal Tap"
52:51;52:53;"as like a lifestyle kind of,"
52:53;52:54;"like it's so dumb."
52:54;52:57;"- It has to be done in that tone"
52:57;52:59;"of like that Jeb Bush video you sent me."
52:59;53:00;"- Oh yeah."
53:00;53:01;"- Like the ultra serious."
53:01;53:02;"- Right."
53:02;53:06;"- Like it's, I can't stop thinking about this documentary."
53:06;53:08;"- Like a juggalo, like in full face paint."
53:08;53:09;"- I think, I think,"
53:09;53:13;"- With his hands folded, like really thinking of us."
53:13;53:14;"- Juggalos are severely underestimated."
53:14;53:17;"I think the, you know,"
53:17;53:20;"it's like any subculture that people like say"
53:20;53:22;"is like just like stupid,"
53:22;53:23;"that's usually not true."
53:23;53:24;"- I don't think it's stupid at all."
53:24;53:26;"- People say that about a lot of like musical genres."
53:26;53:27;"- I.E."
53:27;53:28;"- I think you need to get a juggalo."
53:28;53:30;"- I think it's easy, it's easy,"
53:30;53:32;"it's easy to make fun of juggalos"
53:32;53:34;"because they're so eccentric."
53:34;53:38;"Like the things that they do are so eccentric to us,"
53:38;53:39;"but they're,"
53:39;53:41;"I wouldn't make fun of someone in that subculture"
53:41;53:44;"because they're getting so much out of it."
53:44;53:47;"- Anyway, Dead Spot, you're a rapper."
53:47;53:48;"- Yeah."
53:48;53:48;"- I think you should show more respect"
53:48;53:51;"to your brothers from the Midwest."
53:51;53:53;"- I mean, I'm not disrespecting them, I don't think,"
53:53;53:56;"by calling them stupid, I think they're down with that."
53:56;53:57;"- The clown."
53:57;53:58;"- Down with the clown."
53:58;54:00;"- Yeah, I am down with the clown, absolutely."
54:00;54:01;"- I mean, people, okay,"
54:01;54:03;"juggalos are one of those things that like,"
54:03;54:05;"yeah, a lot of people talk about,"
54:05;54:07;"they don't always like actually do the research,"
54:07;54:08;"go watch the documentary."
54:08;54:09;"I'm just kind of curious, like where's,"
54:09;54:13;"- Ezra, there's a song called ""What is a Juggalo?"""
54:13;54:14;"- Okay, I think that's what we gotta listen to."
54:14;54:15;"- That you're probably gonna have to listen to."
54:15;54:16;"- Yeah."
54:16;54:17;"- ""What is a Juggalo?"""
54:17;54:18;"- He explains it pretty easily."

57:53;57:57;"- Now we know what a juggalo is."
57:57;57:59;"You could paint your face in a lot of ways."
57:59;58:01;"To paint your face like a clown"
58:01;58:04;"definitely denotes some kind of sense of humor, right?"
58:04;58:06;"- A wicked clown."
58:06;58:09;"- Yeah, but it's like this horror clown."
58:09;58:10;"- It's about being a scary clown."
58:10;58:13;"- Yeah, it's about being like an unsettling clown."
58:13;58:16;"- Yeah, like it."
58:16;58:18;"- It's not that different than like, you know,"
58:18;58:20;"having like a bright pink mohawk or something."
58:20;58:23;"- What's that great documentary, Rich Hill."
58:23;58:24;"It's called Rich Hill."
58:24;58:26;"- Oh, Tommy Hilfiger's son who rapped."
58:26;58:28;"- No, it's not about him."
58:28;58:30;"- Oh yeah, no, I saw the name and I got confused"
58:30;58:31;"'cause I thought it was about Tommy Hilfiger."
58:31;58:33;"- No, that's another great subject matter too."
58:33;58:36;"But Rich Hill is this documentary"
58:36;58:39;"and it's about these kids in a very impoverished environment"
58:39;58:41;"and one of the kids is a juggalo."
58:41;58:42;"And when you watch the movie,"
58:42;58:46;"like he gets so much joy out of it."
58:46;58:49;"He gets so much from it that it's,"
58:49;58:53;"you respect it 'cause he's so, this guy's a hard life."
58:53;58:55;"And like for his birthday,"
58:55;58:57;"he's like going to like a gathering of the juggalos"
58:57;58:59;"and like he loves it."
58:59;59:03;"And so it's cool to see it from that perspective."
59:03;59:06;"Something that's so easily made, make fun ofable, right?"
59:06;59:08;"Like you can so easily make fun of it."
59:08;59:10;"But then when you watch any of these docs about it,"
59:10;59:13;"it's these people like desperately searching"
59:13;59:16;"for a sense of community, which we all are, right?"
59:16;59:20;"And it's just, but the idiosyncrasies are so out there"
59:20;59:22;"and so easy targets."
59:22;59:23;"- Well, I think some--"
59:23;59:25;"- So it's just awesome to see it like humanized."
59:25;59:28;"- I think sometimes people who feel really alienated"
59:28;59:31;"from society, sometimes subcultures where people already"
59:31;59:33;"have like kind of given up on fully being accepted,"
59:33;59:35;"you actually, you push your parents maybe"
59:35;59:38;"to such an extreme that it's like gonna paint my face"
59:38;59:41;"like this, of course, like lame businessmen"
59:41;59:44;"licking ice cream cones are never gonna like me."
59:44;59:45;"(laughing)"
59:45;59:48;"- Cousin Ash with his ice cream cone."
59:48;59:48;"- Maybe you feel like--"
59:48;59:49;"- I just can't understand."
59:49;59:52;"- I'm already disconnected from like mainstream culture"
59:52;59:53;"to such an extent."
59:53;59:54;"Let me just like push it to an extreme."
59:54;59:56;"Let me dress in a way that's gonna make people think"
59:56;59:58;"I'm crazy, forget it, and I'll have fun with my friends."
59:58;01:00:00;"- And also like, there's nothing, I don't know,"
01:00:00;01:00:03;"people used to make fun of Comic-Con like 20 years ago"
01:00:03;01:00:06;"and now it's like the Super Bowl around the country."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"- No, people go crazy for that stuff."
01:00:08;01:00:11;"- It's just a community of people into something."
01:00:11;01:00:13;"- I think Jonah Hill directing and starring"
01:00:13;01:00:16;"in like the Oscar drama, ""Juggalo"" movie."
01:00:16;01:00:18;"- That's, yeah, maybe that's it."
01:00:18;01:00:22;"'Cause the documentaries are so, they are so,"
01:00:22;01:00:23;"like you could watch with your friends"
01:00:23;01:00:24;"and laugh at a bunch of shit"
01:00:24;01:00:28;"and then you find yourself very unexpectedly--"
01:00:28;01:00:29;"- Painting your face."
01:00:29;01:00:32;"- Rooting, rooting, yeah, you find yourself"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"at an insane clown posse concert,"
01:00:34;01:00:38;"being me as Jonah Hill, dancing my ass off,"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"doing crazy clown dances."
01:00:40;01:00:43;"No, but you find yourself unexpectedly moved"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"by what the people are getting out of it."
01:00:45;01:00:47;"And so there's something interesting there."
01:00:47;01:00:49;"That's just something, I've seen it for like the third time,"
01:00:49;01:00:51;"I saw it for like the third time today,"
01:00:51;01:00:54;"and I was like, I can't stop thinking about this subculture."
01:00:54;01:00:57;"I can't stop thinking about this as a character."
01:00:57;01:00:59;"And so that's kind of where stuff starts, right?"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"Is that where you just are like,"
01:01:01;01:01:05;"what would that, how do you express the person?"
01:01:05;01:01:07;"'Cause clearly the person is lost,"
01:01:07;01:01:09;"trying to find something, trying to find friends,"
01:01:09;01:01:12;"trying to find an identity, right?"
01:01:12;01:01:16;"And so that's the basis of like a good character, kind of."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"- Totally."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"- And Juggalos are interesting,"
01:01:18;01:01:21;"and they're so easy to, no pun intended, clown on."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"Right?"
01:01:22;01:01:25;"Like it's so easy to get with a bunch of your asshole friends"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"and make fun of it, but it was kind of cool"
01:01:27;01:01:30;"to see it so humanized in these two films,"
01:01:30;01:01:32;"American Juggalo and Rich Hill."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"- Right. - You know?"
01:01:33;01:01:34;"It's cool."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"- Yeah, I always felt like"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"when the Insane Clown Posse song came out"
01:01:37;01:01:38;"and you couldn't tell if it was a joke or not,"
01:01:38;01:01:39;"like the Miracles one,"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"and just like all the mainstream publications"
01:01:41;01:01:42;"were clowning on it."
01:01:42;01:01:44;"You know, it's like when too many people"
01:01:44;01:01:45;"are making fun of something,"
01:01:45;01:01:46;"you always like pause and you're like, hmm."
01:01:46;01:01:49;"- Yes, something's spicious for sure, dude."
01:01:49;01:01:51;"- Very. - Very spicious."

01:05:09;01:05:12;"I do use documentaries a lot"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"and pick up little tidbits here and there for work,"
01:05:14;01:05:15;"you know? - Right."
01:05:15;01:05:17;"- Because it's real characters, real life."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"It's way more interesting to me, you know?"
01:05:19;01:05:20;"- That makes sense."
01:05:20;01:05:21;"Yeah, that's the only place"
01:05:21;01:05:24;"where you could like really observe somebody."
01:05:24;01:05:27;"- Yeah, and what's crazy about documentaries is"
01:05:27;01:05:30;"the characters in documentaries are so crazy and out there"
01:05:30;01:05:34;"that if you actually put them into a movie as they were,"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"it would be too broad and you wouldn't even believe it."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"- Right."
01:05:37;01:05:38;"- But there are some documentaries,"
01:05:38;01:05:39;"not like, of course,"
01:05:39;01:05:40;"there's pretty straightforward documentaries,"
01:05:40;01:05:41;"but like, you watch,"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"like my favorite documentary is this movie ""Dig."""
01:05:43;01:05:44;"- Right."
01:05:44;01:05:45;"- And made by Andi Timoner,"
01:05:45;01:05:47;"she's a great documentary filmmaker."
01:05:47;01:05:49;"- Wait, that's the one about the Brian Jonestown massacre?"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"- Brian Jonestown and Dandy Warhols."
01:05:51;01:05:54;"And Anton, the lead singer of Brian Jonestown massacre,"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"is like one of the greatest characters in any movie ever."
01:05:56;01:05:59;"And if you put him on screen in like a narrative feature,"
01:05:59;01:06:00;"you'd call bullsh-- - It'd be too much."
01:06:00;01:06:04;"- 'Cause the guy's so out there, you know?"
01:06:04;01:06:07;"Which is interesting to circle it back to ""Juggalos"""
01:06:07;01:06:08;"just for a minute. - Yeah."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"- 'Cause I don't think we hashed enough on that topic."
01:06:10;01:06:12;"(laughing)"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"But if you put the dude from ""Insane Clown Bossy"""
01:06:14;01:06:17;"in a narrative movie as he actually was,"
01:06:17;01:06:21;"you may be like, ""Nah, man, people don't act like that."""
01:06:21;01:06:21;"- Right. - You know?"
01:06:21;01:06:24;"And that's what's kind of cool is to find little tidbits"
01:06:24;01:06:28;"or things that people do in real life documentaries"
01:06:28;01:06:30;"and try and pull them into characters, you know?"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"But like music too, I imagine same thing."
01:06:32;01:06:35;"It's like you really do take a little from here,"
01:06:35;01:06:36;"take a little from there."
01:06:36;01:06:37;"You're inspired by tons of different sh--"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"and then you kind of mash it up"
01:06:39;01:06:41;"and then put your own stamp on it."
01:06:41;01:06:44;"- Yeah, totally, 'cause you gotta use references sometimes."
01:06:44;01:06:47;"Like what do you want the drums to sound like?"
01:06:47;01:06:49;"You know, you wanna sound like the '60s?"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"You wanna sound like the Rolling Stones?"
01:06:51;01:06:52;"Yeah, you need references to kind of sometimes"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"like speak a common language,"
01:06:54;01:06:55;"especially with the people you're working with."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"- Yeah, well, I'll notice like big artists,"
01:06:57;01:07:00;"like even like Drake, you'll clearly hear him be influenced"
01:07:00;01:07:03;"by like Jamaican music or other kinds of music."
01:07:03;01:07:05;"And it's like, oh, he's probably listening"
01:07:05;01:07:07;"to some great Jamaican record and was like,"
01:07:07;01:07:11;"oh, I kind of wanna infuse that with the sh-- that I do."
01:07:11;01:07:14;"And then you get this kind of music, you know?"
01:07:14;01:07:16;"For me, it just happens way more from documentaries"
01:07:16;01:07:19;"than it does from like classic narrative films."

01:10:50;01:10:54;"with Ezra Koenig on Beat Squad."
01:10:54;01:10:56;"- So we're all about the same age."
01:10:56;01:11:01;"So let's see, who was born in 1984?"
01:11:01;01:11:02;"You, Asher? - I was."
01:11:02;01:11:04;"- I'm December '83. - December '83."
01:11:04;01:11:06;"So we were all born within about"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"four months of each other."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"Despot, you would have been a senior"
01:11:10;01:11:13;"when we were freshmen in high school."
01:11:13;01:11:15;"- I would have beat you up."
01:11:15;01:11:16;"- No way, you would have been like,"
01:11:16;01:11:17;"who are these cool freshmen?"
01:11:17;01:11:19;"Let me take them under my wing."
01:11:19;01:11:21;"- I'm inspired by these freshmen."
01:11:21;01:11:23;"(laughing)"
01:11:23;01:11:29;"- So I was thinking, because we're the exact same age,"
01:11:29;01:11:30;"you know, we have a lot of the same"
01:11:30;01:11:31;"cultural reference points."
01:11:31;01:11:32;"So I was just thinking like,"
01:11:32;01:11:35;"what's a funny point when we were kids"
01:11:35;01:11:36;"that we could revisit?"
01:11:36;01:11:39;"So I thought maybe when we were freshmen, 1999."
01:11:39;01:11:41;"So let's paint a picture."
01:11:41;01:11:43;"Jonah, what was 1999 like for you?"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"You were about 14, 15 years old."
01:11:45;01:11:47;"- Skateboarding. - Yeah."
01:11:47;01:11:49;"- Big part of my life."
01:11:49;01:11:52;"I think South Park came on that year."
01:11:52;01:11:56;"I wanna say that was like a big deal when that came on."
01:11:56;01:11:58;"Probably like Christopher Guest movies maybe"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"were real big around that time."
01:12:00;01:12:01;"I was starting to like--"
01:12:01;01:12:02;"- Waiting for Guffman."
01:12:02;01:12:04;"- Yeah, that was popping up."
01:12:04;01:12:06;"Or maybe even like Best in Show"
01:12:06;01:12:07;"might have even been around that time."
01:12:07;01:12:08;"- Yeah, that sounds about right."
01:12:08;01:12:13;"- And then real backpack ass indie hip hop."
01:12:13;01:12:15;"- Yeah."
01:12:15;01:12:18;"- Like that was like the real back,"
01:12:18;01:12:22;"like the heyday of like dilated peoples,"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"like people under the stairs and like that."
01:12:24;01:12:27;"- You know, I have a big rap record in '99,"
01:12:27;01:12:28;"like a little bit related to that."
01:12:28;01:12:31;"All My Friends Loved, The Roots, Things Fall Apart."
01:12:31;01:12:32;"- Great album."
01:12:32;01:12:34;"- I forget, that came out around that era."
01:12:34;01:12:35;"- Yeah, Gang--"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"I think Moment of Truth came out around then too."
01:12:37;01:12:38;"- Yeah, it did."
01:12:38;01:12:39;"- Gangstar, that was like the biggest album"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"when that came out for me and my friends."
01:12:41;01:12:43;"- I feel like H to the Izzo"
01:12:43;01:12:44;"kind of felt like the beginning"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"of like a fully new era of rap,"
01:12:46;01:12:46;"which I think was that 2001?"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"- That might have been 2001, yeah."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"- Yeah, so I feel like until then,"
01:12:50;01:12:53;"like somewhere in between like Puff Daddy"
01:12:53;01:12:54;"and H to the Izzo was like--"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"- Yeah, it was the shiny suit era."
01:12:56;01:12:57;"- Right."
01:12:57;01:12:59;"- Oh yeah, that was like hieroglyphics too for me."
01:12:59;01:13:01;"That falls under the backpack rap,"
01:13:01;01:13:01;"but that was like huge."
01:13:01;01:13:04;"- All your backpack rap references are so West Coast."
01:13:04;01:13:07;"- I know, I was straight up West Coast."
01:13:07;01:13:09;"- Yeah, like AC Alone."
01:13:09;01:13:11;"- Yeah, freestyle fellas."
01:13:11;01:13:13;"- Now, what I pulled were the top 10 songs"
01:13:13;01:13:15;"of this moment back in '99,"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"so we're probably not gonna get too much backpack,"
01:13:17;01:13:20;"but let's just see if any of these bring back any memories."
01:13:20;01:13:21;"- I mean, I was still aware."
01:13:21;01:13:24;"- When we were 15, no, I mean, we know all these songs."
01:13:24;01:13:27;"So this was a really big song back in May."
01:13:27;01:13:29;"- Are we starting at number five?"
01:13:29;01:13:30;"- No, we're gonna do top five later."
01:13:30;01:13:32;"I'm just kinda like gonna do more impressionistical."
01:13:32;01:13:34;"- Okay, just painting a picture."
01:13:34;01:13:37;"- Just painting a picture of what was blasting out of--"
01:13:37;01:13:38;"- Dude, let me be your canvas."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"You just paint."
01:13:40;01:13:44;"- In 1999, so 1999, 15 years old,"
01:13:44;01:13:45;"this was a big song."
01:13:45;01:13:48;"- Wow."
01:13:48;01:13:51;"- I guess '99 was part of--"
01:13:51;01:13:53;"- Jay-Z was doing some different back then, huh?"
01:13:53;01:13:54;"- Yeah."

01:15:31;01:15:35;"is it does have that like romanticism of Latin music,"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"like Latin pop and Latin like male singers."
01:15:37;01:15:38;"Like."

01:16:09;01:16:11;"Like everything was like super shiny."
01:16:11;01:16:12;"- Yeah, bleached hair, dudes with bleached hair."
01:16:12;01:16:13;"- Super fake."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"Bush wasn't president yet."
01:16:14;01:16:16;"- Goggles, like dudes wearing goggles."
01:16:16;01:16:19;"Like I remember when like ""Can't Hardly Wait"" came out"
01:16:19;01:16:20;"and said, ""We need more of those goggles."""
01:16:20;01:16:23;"Like dudes in my school started wearing like goggles"
01:16:23;01:16:24;"on their frosted tips."
01:16:24;01:16:26;"It was very like NSYNC vibes, right?"
01:16:26;01:16:29;"- Yeah, that was a weird time 'cause it was pre-9/11."
01:16:29;01:16:31;"- The world was happier."
01:16:31;01:16:32;"- Yeah."
01:16:32;01:16:33;"- We were more carefree."
01:16:33;01:16:35;"- Our biggest concern was Y2K back then."
01:16:35;01:16:37;"- You could wear a metallic suit to the airport"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"and the thing wouldn't beep."
01:16:39;01:16:41;"(laughing)"
01:16:41;01:16:42;"The back seat boys were able to travel in peace."
01:16:42;01:16:44;"Imagine their travel game after that"
01:16:44;01:16:45;"with all that jewelry on."
01:16:45;01:16:48;"- You could bring a two liter of Pepsi in your carry-on."
01:16:48;01:16:49;"(laughing)"
01:16:49;01:16:51;"That's a very different time."
01:16:51;01:16:52;"- You light up a cigarette,"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"walk into the metal detector."
01:16:54;01:16:56;"- You could eat McDonald's, nobody give you a hard time."
01:16:56;01:16:57;"- Oh man."
01:16:57;01:16:58;"- How about you remember this one?"
01:16:58;01:17:01;"(soft music)"
01:17:01;01:17:06;"♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪"
01:17:06;01:17:10;"♪ This club is a guy that thinks he's hot ♪"
01:17:10;01:17:11;"- I like this song."
01:17:11;01:17:12;"- This is still a great song."
01:17:12;01:17:14;"- If this was released today"
01:17:14;01:17:19;"by like a hipster opening ceremony pop girl."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"- What about the other version?"
01:17:20;01:17:24;"- It would be like a quote unquote hip and cool song,"
01:17:24;01:17:25;"I think."
01:17:25;01:17:27;"- What about the callback to this song?"
01:17:27;01:17:29;"- Twigs on this."
01:17:29;01:17:30;"- Yeah, no pigeons."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"- Yeah, no pigeons."
01:17:32;01:17:33;"Oh my God."
01:17:33;01:17:34;"- No pigeons."
01:17:34;01:17:36;"- I don't even wanna hear no pigeons, dude."
01:17:36;01:17:39;"I don't even wanna hear the misogyny"
01:17:39;01:17:41;"that goes on in that song."
01:17:41;01:17:44;"Can you just imagine what the lyrics to no pigeons are?"
01:17:44;01:17:47;"- How much better does it sound than live in La Vida Loca?"
01:17:47;01:17:48;"This holds up."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"- It's so good."
01:17:49;01:17:50;"- Yeah."
01:17:50;01:17:51;"- Good song."
01:17:51;01:17:52;"♪ He's checking me but his game is kinda weak ♪"
01:17:52;01:17:54;"♪ And I know that he cannot approach me ♪"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"♪ 'Cause I'm looking like class ♪"
01:17:56;01:17:57;"♪ And he's looking like trash ♪"
01:17:57;01:18:00;"♪ Can't get with a pimpy ass so ♪"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"♪ No, I don't want your number ♪"
01:18:02;01:18:05;"♪ No, I don't wanna give you mine ♪"
01:18:05;01:18:08;"♪ And no, I don't wanna meet you nowhere ♪"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"♪ No, don't want none of your time ♪"
01:18:10;01:18:13;"♪ No, I don't want no scrub ♪"
01:18:13;01:18:16;"♪ A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me ♪"
01:18:16;01:18:19;"♪ Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride ♪"
01:18:19;01:18:21;"♪ Trying to holler at me ♪"
01:18:21;01:18:23;"♪ I don't want no scrub ♪"
01:18:23;01:18:26;"♪ A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me ♪"
01:18:26;01:18:30;"♪ Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride ♪"
01:18:30;01:18:31;"♪ Trying to holler at me ♪"
01:18:31;01:18:32;"- Yeah, this sounds good."
01:18:32;01:18:33;"- You could still put this on at a party"
01:18:33;01:18:35;"and just watch it. - This pissed me off too."
01:18:35;01:18:35;"- Yeah."
01:18:35;01:18:37;"- 'Cause I didn't, I'm from New York,"
01:18:37;01:18:38;"so I couldn't drive a car."
01:18:38;01:18:40;"So then they say that passenger side"
01:18:40;01:18:41;"of his best friend's ride thing,"
01:18:41;01:18:44;"and it's like, ew, I don't know how to drive."
01:18:44;01:18:46;"And I'm 17, I'm from New York."
01:18:46;01:18:48;"- So you probably were in the passenger side"
01:18:48;01:18:49;"of your best friend's ride."
01:18:49;01:18:51;"- Yeah, and there was nothing wrong with that."
01:18:51;01:18:52;"My best friend was older."
01:18:52;01:18:53;"- They're trying to imply that you're broke."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"You don't even have your own car."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"- Yeah."
01:18:55;01:18:56;"- Although I don't think somebody"
01:18:56;01:18:57;"would consider it a scrub"
01:18:57;01:18:59;"just 'cause they don't own a vehicle."
01:18:59;01:19:00;"- That's not, you're missing the point."
01:19:00;01:19:02;"The point's not that he doesn't have a car."
01:19:02;01:19:04;"The point is that he's treating her disrespectfully"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"and he doesn't even, like, if he had a car,"
01:19:06;01:19:07;"it might make it a little better,"
01:19:07;01:19:11;"'cause he's just hollering at her in a (beep) way."
01:19:11;01:19:14;"But he's not even like, he's driving, yeah."
01:19:14;01:19:15;"- He was like, ooh."
01:19:15;01:19:16;"- At least he's got a (beep) together."
01:19:16;01:19:18;"He's got a car."
01:19:18;01:19:19;"And maybe it was a bad moment."
01:19:19;01:19:22;"- No Scrubs is a very unromantic song"
01:19:22;01:19:23;"because it was basically talking about"
01:19:23;01:19:24;"the dark side of courtship."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"- Well, you also got Bill's Bill's Bills,"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"which is another kind of demeaning song,"
01:19:28;01:19:29;"if you think about it."
01:19:29;01:19:31;"- Men's rights."
01:19:31;01:19:32;"There was a real, there was a real"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"like get your (beep) together attitude going on."
01:19:34;01:19:36;"- Yeah, it's about that you need to like"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"be able to support,"
01:19:38;01:19:40;"there would never be a top female artist"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"that would release a song now"
01:19:42;01:19:45;"about needing to be supported by a man."
01:19:45;01:19:46;"- 'Cause if you--"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"- Because it wouldn't be a strong message"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"saying like you don't need a man to support you."
01:19:50;01:19:52;"- Yeah, right, 'cause Destiny's Child, Bill's Bill's,"
01:19:52;01:19:53;"what were the lyrics?"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"You gotta pay my automobile bills."
01:19:55;01:19:56;"- Pay my telephone bills."
01:19:56;01:19:58;"- And then maybe we can chill."
01:19:58;01:20:01;"Although, pay my automobile bills."
01:20:01;01:20:03;"I guess they're, yeah, I can't picture"
01:20:03;01:20:07;"Beyonce releasing a Bill's Bill's Bills in 2016."
01:20:07;01:20:10;"- It doesn't seem like it would be appropriate."
01:20:10;01:20:11;"- Yeah, which is a good thing."
01:20:11;01:20:12;"I think it's a good thing."
01:20:12;01:20:13;"I'm just saying it doesn't seem,"
01:20:13;01:20:14;"it would fly now."
01:20:14;01:20:16;"- Yeah, 'cause they chant with independent,"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"unless they framed it as like,"
01:20:18;01:20:21;"you know what, you're such a sexist Scrub,"
01:20:21;01:20:22;"you don't even deserve to talk to me."
01:20:22;01:20:23;"You can pay my bills,"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"then maybe I'll deign to speak to you."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"That's like kind of an empowering version."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"- It's called Fyndom,"
01:20:28;01:20:32;"a financial dominatrixism."
01:20:32;01:20:33;"- Wait, what does that mean?"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"- A Fyndom is like,"
01:20:35;01:20:38;"they make like shopping lists on like Amazon.com"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"and then they have these admirers"
01:20:40;01:20:41;"and they're like, yeah,"
01:20:41;01:20:44;"buy me like 10 purses and five pairs of shoes"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"and I'll let you talk to me."
01:20:46;01:20:47;"- Yeah."
01:20:47;01:20:48;"- And the guys are like, oh yeah."
01:20:48;01:20:50;"- It's really sexy actually, you should try it."
01:20:50;01:20:50;"- Yeah."
01:20:50;01:20:53;"- You go on Amazon and you pay for a bunch of shit"
01:20:53;01:20:54;"for a stranger on the internet"
01:20:54;01:20:57;"and then you talk to them after."
01:20:57;01:21:00;"- Can I say the link to my Amazon wishlist?"
01:21:00;01:21:01;"- Do you have?"
01:21:01;01:21:01;"- No."
01:21:01;01:21:02;"(laughing)"
01:21:02;01:21:03;"- Just buy it, Amazon."
01:21:03;01:21:06;"- Well, I have seen people on Twitter"
01:21:06;01:21:09;"who have like their Amazon wishlist in their bio,"
01:21:09;01:21:10;"but I didn't think it was like,"
01:21:10;01:21:11;"pay for it, then you talk to me."
01:21:11;01:21:13;"I thought it was almost more like, hey."
01:21:13;01:21:14;"- If you wanna send a gift."
01:21:14;01:21:15;"- If you wanna send a gift,"
01:21:15;01:21:18;"if you appreciate me as a social media personality."
01:21:18;01:21:19;"- Well, some people--"
01:21:19;01:21:20;"- This is stuff that I need."
01:21:20;01:21:21;"That's pretty reasonable."
01:21:21;01:21:24;"- Some people do it, perform it as a fetish."
01:21:24;01:21:26;"Other people are just like, yeah, I'm broke."
01:21:26;01:21:27;"Get me an iPad."
01:21:27;01:21:31;"- There's guys out there who feel sexually aroused by--"
01:21:31;01:21:32;"- Buying stuff."
01:21:32;01:21:34;"- By buying stuff for people."
01:21:34;01:21:34;"- Yeah."
01:21:34;01:21:36;"- Well, that sounds like a win-win then."
01:21:36;01:21:37;"- Yeah, I guess."
01:21:37;01:21:39;"- Yeah, I want one of those guys to be attracted to me."
01:21:39;01:21:40;"(laughing)"
01:21:40;01:21:41;"- I got a wishlist."
01:21:41;01:21:43;"- Pay my automobile."
01:21:43;01:21:45;"- The guy's probably like married with kids"
01:21:45;01:21:48;"and his wife is like, it's really weird that we're broke."
01:21:48;01:21:50;"And he's like, well, you know, I had to buy this."
01:21:50;01:21:51;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:21:51;01:21:52;"- I have four PlayStations."
01:21:52;01:21:55;"- I would never judge another person's fetish or situation,"
01:21:55;01:21:56;"but here's what I want to say"
01:21:56;01:21:59;"to all the Amazon wishlist guys out there."
01:21:59;01:22:01;"Be honest with your wife about it."
01:22:01;01:22:02;"- Yeah, don't hide it."
01:22:02;01:22:03;"- Don't hide it."
01:22:03;01:22:03;"- Yeah."
01:22:03;01:22:04;"- That ruins a lot of marriages."
01:22:04;01:22:06;"- Yeah, your wife would be totally cool with it."
01:22:06;01:22:07;"(laughing)"
01:22:07;01:22:08;"- Well, it's not a problem."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"- I mean--"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"- And if she's not, she's not the right one, bro."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"- Let's flip it, let's flip it, guys."
01:22:13;01:22:16;"Let's say that you were married and your wife said,"
01:22:16;01:22:19;"listen, I love you, but I do feel a little bit constricted"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"by our relationship."
01:22:21;01:22:24;"I will never cheat on you, and I will never ask"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"to have an open relationship,"
01:22:26;01:22:30;"but just to let a little air out of the bag,"
01:22:30;01:22:31;"(laughing)"
01:22:31;01:22:35;"I would like to buy some hot young men"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"things on their Amazon wishlist."
01:22:37;01:22:38;"How would you take that?"
01:22:38;01:22:39;"- Whose money are you using?"
01:22:39;01:22:41;"- That's A."
01:22:41;01:22:42;"- She'd be using her own money."
01:22:42;01:22:44;"- Do we have a joint bank account?"
01:22:44;01:22:45;"- Let's say you have a joint bank account."
01:22:45;01:22:47;"- Yeah, then no, get out."
01:22:47;01:22:49;"- Do we get one as well, though?"
01:22:49;01:22:51;"Like anything they buy them, they have to buy us as well."
01:22:51;01:22:53;"- Not if I'm paying for it."
01:22:53;01:22:54;"Then don't buy me anything."
01:22:54;01:22:55;"- Okay, okay, let's say--"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"- It's a surprise, it's nice to get a present."
01:22:57;01:22:59;"- Let's say that your wife is financially,"
01:22:59;01:23:00;"let's say your wife makes more money than you."
01:23:00;01:23:01;"- Then it's all good."
01:23:01;01:23:02;"- Okay."
01:23:02;01:23:04;"- Dude, you should just drop that Ricky Martin song"
01:23:04;01:23:05;"in the middle of this conversation."
01:23:05;01:23:07;"(laughing)"
01:23:07;01:23:08;"- Now that's--"
01:23:08;01:23:09;"- Oh, I'm sad."
01:23:09;01:23:10;"(laughing)"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"- Now that's living La Vida Loca."
01:23:12;01:23:13;"I truly believe--"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"- That's what I'd say to my wife."
01:23:15;01:23:17;"You're living La Vida Loca right now."
01:23:17;01:23:18;"(laughing)"
01:23:18;01:23:19;"- Yeah."
01:23:19;01:23:21;"- She's probably buying stuff for Ricky Martin."
01:23:21;01:23:23;"- You should never judge another person's fetish,"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"but don't lie."
01:23:25;01:23:26;"- Let me ask you this."
01:23:26;01:23:27;"- Yeah."
01:23:27;01:23:28;"- Just since we're on an interesting subject matter."
01:23:28;01:23:30;"I do want to, before I go on, just say,"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"I'm not knocking Destiny's Child"
01:23:32;01:23:33;"for making bills, bills, bills."
01:23:33;01:23:35;"I'm just thinking it's an interesting sign"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"of the times of what we're doing,"
01:23:37;01:23:40;"by going back to 1999,"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"imagining that that wouldn't be a song today."
01:23:42;01:23:44;"- It doesn't feel like the most modern sentiment."
01:23:44;01:23:44;"I know what you mean."
01:23:44;01:23:46;"- I think it would be an odd message"
01:23:46;01:23:49;"for a top female artist to put out right now."
01:23:49;01:23:51;"- Well, no, 'cause even if you think about"
01:23:51;01:23:55;"on the last Beyonce album, on that song Formation,"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"she's talking about if he hits it good,"
01:23:57;01:24:00;"maybe I'll take him to Red Lobster."
01:24:00;01:24:01;"- And that's awesome."
01:24:01;01:24:02;"That's an awesome message."
01:24:02;01:24:03;"- Yeah."
01:24:03;01:24:06;"- She also made 10 songs about being an independent"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"and powerful woman after that."
01:24:08;01:24:10;"- Right, of course, dude."
01:24:10;01:24:11;"I mean, of course."
01:24:11;01:24:12;"I'm not knocking that."
01:24:12;01:24:13;"It's just interesting to think about that song"
01:24:13;01:24:14;"being released now."
01:24:14;01:24:15;"That's what I'm saying."
01:24:15;01:24:17;"- It's also interesting that Beyonce was the person"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"saying pay for everything in my life."
01:24:19;01:24:20;"- But the times were different."
01:24:20;01:24:22;"- And then she was like, you know what?"
01:24:22;01:24:23;"I'll pay for it."
01:24:23;01:24:23;"- Here's my take."
01:24:23;01:24:24;"- Don't you think?"
01:24:24;01:24:27;"- I think Beyonce has always been addressing"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"the power imbalance between men and women,"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"including Bills, Bills, Bills."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"It's just the solution has changed."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"Bills, Bills, Bills is addressing the power imbalance"
01:24:35;01:24:36;"between men and women, but it's saying,"
01:24:36;01:24:39;"this is all messed up, so you're gonna pay for me."
01:24:39;01:24:42;"And now she's saying, I'm gonna pay for you."
01:24:42;01:24:44;"- And Ricky's just saying, it's free over here."
01:24:44;01:24:45;"(laughing)"
01:24:45;01:24:48;"- He's over here and the wig's going all y'all are cray, dude."
01:24:48;01:24:51;"- So we've come a long way."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"- On a more romantic note, this song was big in '99."
01:24:53;01:24:55;"You guys remember this one?"
01:24:55;01:24:58;"(acoustic guitar music)"
01:24:58;01:25:00;"- Oh yeah."
01:25:00;01:25:01;"Still sounds good to me."
01:25:01;01:25:02;"- This sounds good."
01:25:02;01:25:03;"- Damn, this is '99?"
01:25:03;01:25:05;"- Yeah, man."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"- Feels like it was like '90."
01:25:07;01:25:08;"- Oh really?"
01:25:08;01:25:09;"- Yeah."
01:25:09;01:25:09;"- Wait, do you know what this is?"
01:25:09;01:25:10;"- This is a Timeless song."
01:25:10;01:25:12;"- Yeah, this is ""Kiss Me,"" right?"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"- By who?"
01:25:13;01:25:14;"- I don't know."
01:25:14;01:25:14;"- Are you?"
01:25:14;01:25:15;"- No."
01:25:15;01:25:16;"- Come on, Despot, you know."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"- P. Diddy?"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"And the family?"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"- Despot, admit it, you know what this is."
01:25:21;01:25:23;"The name of the band starts with six."
01:25:23;01:25:25;"- Six Pence, None the Richer?"
01:25:25;01:25:27;"(laughing)"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"- Maybe the worst name in music history."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"- Every tough guy has their soft side."
01:25:31;01:25:32;"- Damn."
01:25:32;01:25:33;"- I love that band name."
01:25:33;01:25:36;"- Was this from ""Romeo and Juliet"" soundtrack?"
01:25:36;01:25:37;"- No, no, you're thinking of ""Cardigans."""
01:25:37;01:25:38;"- Oh, that was ""Cardigans."""
01:25:38;01:25:39;"- That was ""Cardigans,"" yeah."
01:25:39;01:25:41;"- That was ""Love Fool."""
01:25:41;01:25:42;"Beautiful song, that's from '97."
01:25:42;01:25:44;"- What's this from, like ""Empire Records"" or something?"
01:25:44;01:25:47;"- Oh, no, ""She's All That."""
01:25:47;01:25:48;"- ""She's All That."""
01:25:48;01:25:51;"- I thought this was like Melissa Etheridge or something."

01:26:47;01:26:50;"All the movies that these were on the soundtrack to,"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"like those Freddie Prinze Jr. movies,"
01:26:52;01:26:57;"like that whole Rachel Leigh Cooks era of like teen movies."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"- Super evocative of that era."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"No, I mean, we can talk about it."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"What do you gotta say about it?"
01:27:01;01:27:04;"- No, like, honestly."
01:27:04;01:27:05;"Honestly, man, I don't have (beep) to say about it."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"I just think it's an interesting,"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"those movies are like really interesting to me."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"Like they're--"
01:27:10;01:27:11;"- Yeah, there's something,"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"those movies were all like a little corny."
01:27:13;01:27:15;"Those movies, that was kind of--"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"- They were the equivalent to the music of that era,"
01:27:17;01:27:17;"and that's why it's interesting."
01:27:17;01:27:20;"- I have no disrespect to Freddie Prinze Jr."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"or his beautiful wife, Sarah Michelle Gellar."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"They're good friends."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"But to me, the '80s teen movies--"
01:27:25;01:27:26;"- Good friends with each other."
01:27:26;01:27:27;"- Good friends with each other."
01:27:27;01:27:28;"- Exactly."
01:27:28;01:27:32;"- '80s teen movies had like a lot of heart and intelligence,"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"like the John Hughes ones."
01:27:34;01:27:35;"- These ones were lazy."
01:27:35;01:27:35;"- And this was kind of a dip."
01:27:35;01:27:37;"- You know what was a good movie"
01:27:37;01:27:41;"about high school students later was ""Superbad."""
01:27:41;01:27:42;"And I'm not just saying that 'cause we're friends."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"That kind of like changed the game a little bit."
01:27:44;01:27:47;"- I would say there were good ones before."
01:27:47;01:27:49;"Like I think ""Can't Hardly Wait"" genuinely was a good,"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"was one that when it came out, I remember--"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"- I feel like that wouldn't hold up."
01:27:52;01:27:53;"- I haven't seen it since it came out,"
01:27:53;01:27:56;"but I remember us liking it in a different way"
01:27:56;01:27:57;"than we hated on these kinds of teeny movies."
01:27:57;01:27:59;"- It had like a real story."
01:27:59;01:28:00;"It had a natural story."
01:28:00;01:28:01;"- They tried to make a John Hughes movie."
01:28:01;01:28:02;"- Yeah."
01:28:02;01:28:04;"- That was what I liked about it."
01:28:04;01:28:05;"And then, well, ""Dazed and Confused""--"
01:28:05;01:28:08;"- Or like, it was like a ""Dazed and Confused,"""
01:28:08;01:28:10;"like a '90s ""Dazed and Confused."""
01:28:10;01:28:11;"- Yeah, I guess that's true."
01:28:11;01:28:14;"I mean, like the '80s, like John Hughes is just"
01:28:14;01:28:17;"because he's such a dope artist, right?"
01:28:17;01:28:20;"So it's like, it's literally John Hughes went on a tear"
01:28:20;01:28:25;"of just like digging deep into his emotional core"
01:28:25;01:28:28;"of how he felt in high school for like six straight years."
01:28:28;01:28:32;"And literally made like two a year that were like bangers."
01:28:32;01:28:33;"You know, he's just a legend."
01:28:33;01:28:34;"So it's like--"
01:28:34;01:28:37;"- 'Cause there was other great stuff about high school"
01:28:37;01:28:40;"in that era, I would say ""Daria."""
01:28:40;01:28:41;"- Yes."
01:28:41;01:28:42;"- That's showing it, the cartoon on MTV."
01:28:42;01:28:45;"That was like funny and like unique to the era."
01:28:45;01:28:46;"- ""Kids."""
01:28:46;01:28:47;"- ""Kids,"" yeah."
01:28:47;01:28:49;"- Like that other side of--"
01:28:49;01:28:51;"- Yeah, so there was good, it just like that kind of like"
01:28:51;01:28:55;"suburban high school movie was not popping in the '90s."
01:28:55;01:28:58;"- But ""Kids"" was mid '90s, it wasn't 2000."
01:28:58;01:28:59;"- Yeah."
01:28:59;01:29:00;"- It wasn't like late '90s."
01:29:00;01:29:02;"- It's like everything was like a little phony."
01:29:02;01:29:03;"- Everything frosted over."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"- Yeah, everything's like a little sugar-coated"
01:29:05;01:29:06;"and fake and shiny."
01:29:06;01:29:07;"- All right guys."
01:29:07;01:29:08;"- ""Things I Hate About You,"" all of those."
01:29:08;01:29:10;"- I didn't see any of those movies."
01:29:10;01:29:12;"- Sega Saturn, early PlayStation."
01:29:12;01:29:13;"- Yeah, totally."
01:29:13;01:29:14;"- Dreamcast."
01:29:14;01:29:15;"- Dreamcast."
01:29:15;01:29:18;"All right guys, we gotta wrap up our 1999 segment."
01:29:18;01:29:18;"- One more."
01:29:18;01:29:19;"- Let's listen to one more song."
01:29:19;01:29:22;"I want you to tell me what this evokes for you."
01:29:22;01:29:25;"(dramatic music)"
01:29:25;01:29:29;"You recognize it yet?"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"- No."
01:29:31;01:29:33;"- This song was massive in '99."
01:29:33;01:29:35;"(dramatic music)"
01:29:35;01:29:39;"- Oh gosh."
01:29:39;01:29:40;"- Oh."
01:29:40;01:29:41;"- This is ""Life After Love""?"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"- No, nobody ever talks about this song."
01:29:43;01:29:45;"- By the way, this (beep) sounds like"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"every David Bueta (beep) song."

01:37:26;01:37:30;"We're taking it back to 2007 here on Top Prices. It's time for the Top 5."
01:37:30;01:37:36;"It's time for the Top 5 on iTunes."
01:37:36;01:37:40;"My man Michelangelo would say, ""Buyakasha."""
01:37:40;01:37:42;"Let's do it."
01:37:42;01:37:48;"Number 5, Calvin Harris, featuring Rihanna, ""This Is What You Came For."""
01:37:48;01:37:50;"You heard about this one?"
01:37:50;01:37:52;"No."
01:37:52;01:37:58;"Is this popular? I can't tell. I thought this was going to set the world on fire and no one seems to care."
01:37:58;01:38:02;"I think it's doing well. It's not quite ""We Found Love in a Hopeless Place."""
01:38:02;01:38:08;"[singing]"
01:38:08;01:38:10;"This would not be on the charts without Cher."
01:38:10;01:38:12;"I haven't heard these in over a year."
01:38:12;01:38:20;"I have a question. Because I'm not a musician, obviously. Is Calvin Harris, he makes all this music? He makes the music?"
01:38:20;01:38:28;"Calvin Harris is known in the industry as... There's a lot of stuff where people, like some DJs who are nameless, slap their name on somebody else's beat."
01:38:28;01:38:34;"Calvin Harris is not just a DJ. He's like a composer. He actually writes songs."
01:38:34;01:38:36;"So he makes this music. He's a talented dude."
01:38:36;01:38:42;"Calvin Harris, I'm sure, programmed the vast majority of this and wrote it."
01:38:42;01:38:46;"As a musician, do you respect this kind of music?"
01:38:46;01:38:54;"Yeah, sure. If I'm being harsh, I would say that this is not quite as great a pop song as ""We Found Love in a Hopeless Place."""
01:38:54;01:38:56;"Right. Well, that's so harsh."
01:38:56;01:38:58;"Is that a Calvin Harris?"
01:38:58;01:39:00;"You're being an a**hole."
01:39:00;01:39:02;"Yeah, take that back."
01:39:02;01:39:06;"This is why I don't say anything negative on this show. I'm going to have to send Calvin Harris and Rihanna some Bite of Cocoa."
01:39:06;01:39:08;"Smooth things over. Yeah, sure, I respect this."
01:39:08;01:39:13;"I just don't know when it's a DJ. I don't really know what that means as an outsider."
01:39:13;01:39:19;"There's a lot of people who might be like Calvin Harris and this song is credited to them."
01:39:19;01:39:24;"We're talking about you, DJ Scribble. Yeah, I said it. Do something."
01:39:24;01:39:26;"Calvin Harris is a great songwriter."
01:39:27;01:39:29;"I'm a fan of Calvin Harris."
01:39:29;01:39:31;"I'm a fan of his music."
