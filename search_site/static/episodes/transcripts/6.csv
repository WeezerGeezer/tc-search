00:00;00:04;"Six may be the devil's number, but this is not going to be a devilish episode because"
00:04;00:08;"I'm joined by three people who I consider to be great people."
00:08;00:13;"The Longstreth brothers, Jake, and for the first time, Dave."
00:13;00:15;"As well as my own sister, Emma."
00:15;00:19;"It's a real family affair, and we'll be exploring topics like Thin Lizzy, the Billboard Charts"
00:19;00:24;"of 1985, and 2015's Question King, Justin Bieber."
00:24;00:31;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:38;00:45;"[applause]"
01:23;01:38;"[applause]"
01:58;02:08;"[applause]"
09:38;09:40;"[applause]"
09:40;09:44;"That was Dirty Projectors with Because Your Light Is Turning Green."
09:44;09:46;"This is a very exciting show."
09:46;09:49;"This is the first time on Time Crisis we've ever had two sets of siblings."
09:49;09:50;"Yeah."
09:50;09:52;"The Longstress and the Koenigs."
09:52;09:55;"Jake, a little later on you're going to be teaching us about Thin Lizzy."
09:55;09:56;"Yeah."
09:56;09:57;"Band from the 70s."
09:57;09:59;"A lot of people probably know Boyz R Back in Town."
09:59;10:00;"Yeah."
10:00;10:01;"But there's more to them than that."
10:01;10:02;"Yeah, absolutely."
10:02;10:03;"So we'll be getting to that a little bit later."
10:03;10:05;"Also we're going to try something different for the top five."
10:05;10:08;"Normally we count down the top five songs on iTunes on Time Crisis."
10:08;10:11;"But this time we're actually doing something that approaches a time crisis."
10:11;10:13;"Can't believe it took us this long to think of it."
10:13;10:17;"We're going to be juxtaposing the top five songs on Billboard right now"
10:17;10:21;"with the top five songs on Billboard 30 years ago in 1985."
10:21;10:22;"I'm psyched."
10:22;10:23;"So that's going to be crazy."
10:23;10:26;"But before we get into that, how's everybody been doing this week?"
10:26;10:27;"I've been good."
10:27;10:29;"Yeah, and what's the most exciting thing that happened to you this week?"
10:29;10:31;"I went to Palm Springs."
10:31;10:32;"Why?"
10:32;10:38;"I went for a birthday party and I didn't even end up going."
10:38;10:41;"I only went to the birthday party for like 30 minutes."
10:41;10:42;"Really?"
10:42;10:43;"It was too crazy."
10:43;10:48;"People were jumping on beds, people with their shoes on."
10:48;10:49;"Really?"
10:49;10:51;"And I felt like the people I was with, we couldn't get past that."
10:51;10:53;"Like in an Airbnb?"
10:53;10:54;"At a hotel."
10:54;10:55;"I don't respect that at all."
10:55;11:00;"Okay, and let me tell you why."
11:00;11:02;"I'm very excited."
11:02;11:06;"Okay, first of all, just because it's a hotel and they wash the sheets"
11:06;11:09;"in some weird industrial laundromat, it's still nasty."
11:09;11:13;"I don't know, if somebody's going to put their shoes on a bed, even at a hotel,"
11:13;11:15;"they might put their shoes anywhere."
11:15;11:16;"I think that's disgusting."
11:16;11:18;"And then you feel like you can't trust those people."
11:18;11:19;"Then you can't trust them."
11:19;11:20;"Everybody in here has stayed at a hotel before, right?"
11:20;11:22;"Yeah, it's a super douchey move."
11:22;11:26;"And we all know that when you're staying at a hotel, one of the biggest anxieties"
11:26;11:28;"is what's happened in this room before I got here."
11:28;11:29;"Right."
11:29;11:31;"Because you know what happened at your home or office."
11:31;11:32;"Hopefully."
11:33;11:35;"But at a hotel, you don't know what happened the day before."
11:35;11:37;"You don't know if people were having sex."
11:37;11:38;"Beating off."
11:38;11:41;"Or worst of all, jumping on the bed with their shoes on."
11:41;11:43;"So I got no respect for that."
11:43;11:45;"Your friends are trash."
11:45;11:49;"So there were a lot of concerns with the party, but we also went to the Integratron."
11:49;11:50;"Have you guys ever been there?"
11:50;11:51;"Yeah."
11:51;11:52;"Did you enjoy it?"
11:52;11:54;"Wait, is that the sound place with the bowls?"
11:54;11:56;"Yeah, yeah, the crystal bowls."
11:56;11:58;"It's very California."
11:58;12:02;"It's very California because also the guy who constructed it"
12:02;12:05;"apparently was given the blueprint by aliens."
12:05;12:08;"Well, that's super like desert vibe."
12:08;12:10;"Aliens might exist."
12:10;12:11;"It's true."
12:11;12:13;"I'm willing to believe it."
12:13;12:18;"Today on the music front, I was putting together a few songs, some ideas for the playlist today."
12:18;12:22;"I feel like Time Crisis is getting a reputation for playing a lot of old music from the 50s,"
12:22;12:24;"60s, and 70s."
12:24;12:28;"So I thought maybe today I'd make more of an effort to play some newer music, stuff"
12:28;12:30;"from the 90s."
12:30;12:33;"So I was thinking about some of my favorite 90s songs, and I put together a little rock"
12:33;12:34;"block."
12:34;12:36;"For some reason, all these songs go together."
12:36;12:39;"They're kind of like the rootsy side of the 90s."
12:39;12:44;"Some people would say Nirvana is what makes them feel like the ultimate early 90s music"
12:44;12:46;"or maybe like hip hop."
12:46;12:50;"But for me, this song just makes me feel like the early 90s so hard."
12:50;12:51;"I'm psyched to hear what it is."
12:51;12:52;"Me too."
12:52;12:56;"All right, let's see who can guess it first from the opening bars."
12:56;12:59;"Oh, Aerosmith?"
12:59;13:00;"Yeah, Aerosmith."
13:00;13:01;"Strong."
13:01;13:02;"Love this song."
13:03;13:04;"Do you?"
13:04;13:05;"Yeah."
13:06;13:15;"There was a time when I was so brokenhearted."
13:15;13:20;"Love wasn't much of a friend of mine."
13:20;13:29;"The tables have turned, yeah, and caused me in them ways I parted."
13:29;13:34;"That kind of love was the killing kind."
13:35;13:42;"Listen, all I want is someone I can't resist."
13:42;13:48;"I know all I need to know right away is I got you."
13:48;13:56;"I was crying when I met you, but now I'm trying to forget you."
13:56;14:02;"Love is sweet misery."
14:02;14:10;"I was trying just to get you, now I'm down 'cause I let you."
14:10;14:15;"Do what you do down on me."
14:15;14:23;"Now he's not in a waiting room, they're talking 'bout you and me."
14:23;14:26;"You, you cry when I make it loud."
14:26;14:30;"Must be what you were saying."
14:30;14:33;"It's down on me."
14:33;14:37;"Yeah, I got to tell you one thing."
14:37;14:39;"It's been on my mind."
14:39;14:42;"Girl, I gotta say."
14:42;14:47;"We're partners in crime."
14:47;14:51;"You got that certain something."
14:51;14:56;"What you give to me takes my breath away."
14:56;15:04;"All I know is true is the devil's in your kiss."
15:04;15:08;"If I let go, I'll be frozen to fire."
15:08;15:10;"I can't resist."
15:10;15:18;"I was crying when I met you, but now I'm trying to forget you."
15:18;15:23;"Love is sweet misery."
15:23;15:31;"I was trying just to get you, now I'm down 'cause I let you."
15:31;15:37;"Do what you do down on me."
15:38;15:41;"[guitar solo]"
15:41;15:58;"What you do is sad and why you let it stay."
15:58;16:01;"Yeah, I know, too late, I know."
16:01;16:05;"Do you give your heart away?"
16:05;16:08;"Yeah, I know."
16:08;16:16;"I was crying when I met you, but now I'm trying to forget you."
16:16;16:21;"Your love is sweet misery."
16:21;16:30;"I was trying just to get you, now I'm dying to let you."
16:30;16:36;"Do what you do, what you do, do, do, do, do."
16:36;16:39;"[guitar solo]"
17:09;17:17;"I was crying when I met you, but now I'm trying to forget you."
17:17;17:22;"Your love is sweet misery."
17:22;17:30;"I was crying when I met you, but now I'm dying 'cause I let you."
17:30;17:36;"Do what you do, what you do, do, do, do, do."
17:36;17:39;"[guitar solo]"
17:39;17:47;"I was trying just to get you, now I'm dying to let you."
17:47;17:51;"Your love is sweet misery."
17:51;17:54;"[guitar solo]"
17:57;18:15;"It looks like a road that you travel on when there's one day here and the next day gone."
18:15;18:19;"Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand, sometimes you turn and you're back to the way."
18:19;18:24;"There's a world outside the darkened door where blues won't haunt you anymore."
18:24;18:29;"With a brave heart, free love and soul, come ride with me to the distant shore."
18:29;18:34;"We won't hesitate, break down the guarded gate."
18:34;18:38;"There's not much time left today."
18:38;18:47;"Life is a highway, I won't ride it all night long."
18:47;18:54;"Get your door in my way, I won't drive it all night long."
18:54;18:57;"[guitar solo]"
18:57;19:01;"Through all these cities and all these towns, it's in my blood and it's all around."
19:01;19:04;"I loved you now like I loved you then."
19:04;19:06;"This is the road and these are the hands."
19:06;19:11;"From Mozambique to those Memphis nights, the Cabo Pass to Vancouver's lights."
19:11;19:13;"Knock me down, I'm back up again."
19:13;19:16;"You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man."
19:16;19:20;"With no load I can't hold, roads are rough, this I know."
19:20;19:25;"I'll be there when the light comes in, just tell 'em we're survivors."
19:25;19:34;"Life is a highway, I won't ride it all night long."
19:34;19:44;"Get your door in my way, I won't drive it all night long."
19:44;19:51;"Life is a highway, I won't ride it all night long."
19:51;20:03;"Get your door in my way, I won't drive it all night long."
20:03;20:13;"There was a distance between you and I."
20:13;20:23;"Misunderstanding once, but now we're looking in the eye."
20:23;20:42;"[guitar solo]"
20:42;20:46;"With no load I can't hold, roads are rough, this I know."
20:46;20:53;"I'll be there when the light comes in, just tell 'em we're survivors."
20:53;21:02;"Life is a highway, I won't ride it all night long."
21:02;21:10;"Get your door in my way, I won't drive it all night long."
21:10;21:12;"Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah!"
21:12;21:21;"Life is a highway, I won't ride it all night long."
21:21;21:29;"Get your door in my way, I won't drive it all night long."
21:29;21:31;"Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah!"
21:31;21:39;"Life is a highway, I won't ride it all night long."
21:39;22:01;"Get your door in my way, I won't drive it all night long."
22:01;22:05;"That was Tom Cochran with Life is a Highway off his album Mad Mad World."
22:05;22:08;"What's that full length like?"
22:08;22:11;"Not familiar with any of the deeper cuts."
22:11;22:16;"There's something about that Aerosmith crying, and Life is a Highway,"
22:16;22:21;"you know, 'cause it's so 90s, but it's also like, it was kind of backwards looking, like rootsy."
22:21;22:24;"Yeah, it was like the mainstream hits that were super out of step"
22:24;22:27;"with what the cool thing that was happening in the mainstream was."
22:27;22:31;"Yeah, I mean Nirvana, why do I keep calling Aerosmith Nirvana?"
22:31;22:34;"That's the best mix-up ever."
22:34;22:35;"Same difference."
22:35;22:37;"I feel like Aerosmith, was Aerosmith cool?"
22:37;22:40;"You know, wait, does Beavis or Butthead wear an Aerosmith t-shirt?"
22:40;22:43;"No, Metallica and AC/DC."
22:43;22:46;"Does Wayne or Garth wear an Aerosmith t-shirt?"
22:46;22:51;"Wayne and Garth to our listeners who are under 25"
22:51;22:55;"are characters from the Wayne's World film franchise and SNL sketch."
22:55;22:59;"Okay, yeah, we just got word from our producers that"
22:59;23:02;"somebody in Wayne's World wore an Aerosmith t-shirt."
23:02;23:04;"Yeah, 'cause Aerosmith was popping off in the 90s."
23:04;23:05;"Oh, it was Garth."
23:05;23:09;"Em and I were talking about earlier that Liv Tyler is our cousin."
23:09;23:10;"Just barely."
23:10;23:12;"Just barely, not even."
23:12;23:13;"You know, I met Liv Tyler once."
23:13;23:14;"Oh, did you?"
23:14;23:16;"And I walked right up to her and said,"
23:16;23:17;"""Hey, cuz."""
23:17;23:18;"""You're my cousin."""
23:18;23:22;"Nah, we like knew somebody in common, and so we started talking, I said,"
23:22;23:25;"""This might sound weird, but supposedly we're cousins."""
23:25;23:31;"Basically, Liv Tyler's mom married a guy who is our cousin that we never met."
23:31;23:32;"Oh my God."
23:32;23:34;"That's about as deep as it goes."
23:34;23:36;"This episode's all about family, if you can't tell."
23:36;23:38;"That's a strong connection."
23:38;23:42;"I want to continue with the new music, because like I said,"
23:42;23:46;"Time Crisis is not just about music from the '50s, '60s, and '70s."
23:46;23:48;"So I was trying to think of more recent hits,"
23:48;23:51;"stuff more from the past 25, 30 years."
23:51;23:55;"And one song that came to mind is a song from the 2000s that I loved."
23:55;23:59;"And I realized I've been talking about this with some of the younger people"
23:59;24:01;"at the office, and they don't really remember this song."
24:01;24:04;"But in some ways, this song paved the way for a lot of what's going on today."
24:04;24:08;"This is a young guy named Eamon, E-A-M-O-N."
24:08;24:11;"I'm probably pronouncing that wrong, but he's a young man from Staten Island,"
24:11;24:15;"and he made this song that was kind of a little bit like doo-wop,"
24:15;24:17;"but it had a lot of foul language."
24:17;24:21;"And it's basically a breakup song called ""F*ck It, I Don't Want You Back."""
24:21;24:23;"Oh, I remember this."
24:23;24:26;"This was a big song about 10, 12 years ago."
24:26;24:29;"But I feel like it's--I don't know, people aren't really respecting it for its influence."
24:29;24:30;"Do you remember this one, Jake?"
24:30;24:31;"I might when you start playing it."
24:31;24:32;"All right, check it out."

28:01;28:04;"I don't know how I feel about it anymore, but whatever"
28:04;28:05;"But poignant"
28:05;28:07;"Poignant, people should know that it existed"
28:07;28:11;"We just, for the first time, opened up the mailbag here on Time Crisis"
28:11;28:13;"Do you have a favorite type of pasta?"
28:13;28:15;"For me, it's squid ink fettuccine"
28:15;28:16;"What's your opinion on Bernie Sanders?"
28:16;28:19;"Do you think he can win the Democratic bid?"
28:19;28:19;"Yes"
28:19;28:21;"People are excited about him"
28:21;28:22;"You think he can?"
28:22;28:23;"Yeah, yeah"
28:23;28:27;"I didn't think he could a few weeks ago, but I don't know, there's a lot of momentum"
28:27;28:28;"How about you?"
28:28;28:31;"He seems like the best of the worst"
28:31;28:33;"Politicians are all trash, man"
28:33;28:37;"That's a hopeful message for the youth"

28:39;28:40;"Do you wear socks and sandals?"
28:40;28:41;"No, of course not"
28:41;28:43;"I don't wear sandals"
28:43;28:45;"I don't wear socks"
28:45;28:49;"Do you have a strict no sandals policy?"
28:49;28:49;"Yeah"
28:49;28:50;"Really?"
28:50;28:51;"Yeah"
28:51;28:52;"You wouldn't do Birkenstocks?"
28:52;28:53;"No"
28:53;28:58;"Okay, maybe we'll dig back into the questions bag a little bit later"
28:58;29:01;"Thank you so much to everybody on Twitter for reaching out"
29:02;29:05;"Time Crisis with Ezra King"
29:05;29:14;"Okay, Jake, it's time to talk about Thin Lizzy"
29:14;29:19;"Okay, Jake, Thin Lizzy is a band from?"
29:19;29:21;"Dublin, Ireland"
29:21;29:21;"Dublin, Ireland"
29:21;29:22;"Yep"
29:22;29:24;"They're probably best known in the States for..."
29:24;29:26;"The Boys Are Back in Town"
29:26;29:27;"You know that song, Emma?"
29:27;29:28;"Yes, I know that one"
29:28;29:30;"And you're not a big classic rock person"
29:30;29:30;"No"
29:30;29:31;"But you know the song The Boys Are Back in Town?"
29:31;29:32;"Of course"
29:32;29:33;"But you would..."
29:33;29:35;"So some people might even think of them as a one-hit wonder"
29:35;29:37;"But you would say that's far from true"
29:37;29:42;"Yeah, that's off Jailbreak from 1976, which I think is their sixth album"
29:42;29:43;"Whoa, really?"
29:43;29:43;"Yeah, yeah"
29:43;29:44;"So they were started..."
29:44;29:49;"They formed in 1969 in Dublin and put out their first record in '71"
29:49;29:50;"Yeah, I mean, I think Thin Lizzy..."
29:50;29:54;"I think the way kind of classic rock radio formatting has gone"
29:54;29:57;"They get kind of lumped in with pretty bad bands from that era"
29:57;30:00;"Bachman Turner Overdrive, Bad Company"
30:01;30:02;"You know, those kind of bands"
30:02;30:03;"AC/DC even"
30:03;30:06;"Wait, but you don't think AC/DC are bad?"
30:06;30:06;"It's okay"
30:06;30:08;"I guess that's a whole other can of worms"
30:08;30:09;"I mean, yeah"
30:09;30:11;"I'll talk about that in two weeks"
30:11;30:14;"Okay, I would say AC/DC is in a different level than Bachman Turner Overdrive"
30:14;30:17;"One interesting thing to me about Thin Lizzy and AC/DC as well"
30:17;30:21;"These are the rock bands that almost had a touch of punk in them"
30:21;30:24;"Bachman Turner Overdrive has zero percent punk"
30:24;30:24;"Right"
30:24;30:27;"AC/DC, even though they're just kind of rock dudes"
30:27;30:30;"There's something about their attitude and even the production"
30:31;30:32;"that I think..."
30:32;30:33;"And the simplicity"
30:33;30:36;"Yeah, like they got written about in early issues of Punk Magazine"
30:36;30:37;"Interesting"
30:37;30:37;"I could see that"
30:37;30:40;"Magazine in New York, that was one of the first punk magazines"
30:40;30:45;"And even Thin Lizzy, there was something almost proto-New Wave about the sound"
30:45;30:47;"Yeah, I mean, it was really like sparse"
30:47;30:50;"Yeah, maybe it's the symbols that... sparse"
30:50;30:53;"The singing was really idiosyncratic and unique to Phil Lynott"
30:53;30:54;"Right"
30:54;30:55;"Well, so let's just kick things off"
30:55;30:56;"Okay"
30:56;30:57;"Just for people who haven't heard him before"
30:57;30:59;"Let's listen a little bit of The Boys Are Back in Town"
30:59;31:01;"Just to remind people who Thin Lizzy is"
31:01;31:05;"Yeah, and this song might include my favorite lyrical rock couplet ever"
31:05;31:06;"What's that?"
31:06;31:09;"Which is ""Friday night they'll be dressed to kill"
31:09;31:10;"Down at Dino's Bar and Grill"""
31:10;31:13;"Friday night they're dressed to kill"
31:13;31:15;"Down at Dino's Bar and Grill"
31:15;31:17;"It's an amazing line"
31:17;31:19;"That's so... it's so good"
31:19;31:23;"It's so funny, but also evocative of, you know, the whole song"
31:23;31:23;"The 70s"
31:23;31:27;"But the whole song is sort of this like nostalgic look at"
31:27;31:31;"The guy is coming back into town and everyone's meeting at the bar on a Friday night"
31:31;31:34;"And it's a summer and the jukebox is blasting out my favorite song"
31:34;31:34;"And..."
31:34;31:36;"At the bar and grill"
31:36;31:37;"Yeah"
31:37;31:38;"Here's Thin Lizzy with The Boys Are Back in Town"
31:38;32:05;"Guess who just got back today?"
32:06;32:08;"Them wild-eyed boys that had been away"
32:08;32:11;"Haven't changed, had much to say"
32:11;32:14;"But man, I still think them cats are crazy"
32:14;32:17;"They were asking if you were around"
32:17;32:20;"How you was, where you could be found"
32:20;32:23;"Told them you were living downtown"
32:23;32:26;"Driving all the old men crazy"
32:26;32:28;"The boys are back in town"
32:28;32:34;"I said the boys are back in town"
32:34;32:43;"The boys are back in town"
32:43;32:59;"You know that chick that used to dance a lot"
32:59;33:03;"Every night she'd be on the floor shaking what she'd got"
33:03;33:06;"Man, when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot"
33:06;33:07;"I mean she was steaming"
33:07;33:11;"And that time over at Johnny's Place"
33:11;33:14;"Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face"
33:14;33:17;"Man, we just fell about the place"
33:17;33:19;"If that chick don't want to know, forget her"
33:19;33:22;"The boys are back in town"
33:22;33:28;"I said the boys are back in town"
33:32;33:33;"The boys are back in town"
33:33;33:37;"The boys are back in town"
33:37;33:55;"Spread the word around"
33:55;33:59;"Guess who's back in town"
33:59;34:06;"You spread the word around"
34:06;34:16;"Friday night they'll be dressed to kill"
34:16;34:19;"Down at Dino's Bar and Grill"
34:19;34:22;"The drink will flow and blood will spill"
34:22;34:24;"And if the boys want to fight, you better let 'em"
34:26;34:29;"There's a new box in the corner blasting out my favorite song"
34:29;34:31;"The night's a-getting warmer, it won't be long"
34:31;34:34;"Won't be long 'til summer comes"
34:34;34:36;"Now that the boys are here again"
34:36;34:39;"The boys are back in town"
34:39;34:45;"The boys are back in town"
34:45;34:51;"The boys are back in town"
34:51;34:54;"Spread the word around"
34:55;34:57;"The boys are back in town"
34:57;35:00;"The boys are back in town"
35:00;35:02;"The boys are back in town"
35:02;35:04;"[Guitar Solo]"
35:35;35:37;"The boys are back in town again"
35:37;35:43;"They're hanging down at Dino's"
35:43;35:55;"The boys are back in town again"
35:55;35:59;"That was Thin Lizzy with ""The Boys Are Back In Town"""
35:59;36:02;"So we were just talking before about the line about a bar and grill"
36:02;36:05;"I'm very interested in this concept of the bar and grill"
36:05;36:07;"What does it connote?"
36:07;36:10;"'Cause everybody knows what a bar is"
36:10;36:11;"Yep"
36:11;36:12;"Everybody knows what a grill is"
36:12;36:15;"But a bar and grill, it's like a grown-up restaurant?"
36:15;36:16;"Yeah"
36:16;36:18;"Is there a ""just a grill"" restaurant?"
36:18;36:20;"Like it's like ""welcome to so-and-so's grill"""
36:20;36:22;"But if you're grillin', you're probably drinkin'"
36:22;36:23;"You're probably also a bar"
36:23;36:24;"But there's something about bar and grill"
36:24;36:27;"You know that TGI Fridays originally was like"
36:27;36:31;"Just like this kind of like bar, I think in Times Square"
36:31;36:31;"I did know this"
36:31;36:32;"That people would go to"
36:32;36:35;"I feel like that was almost like a swingers bar or something"
36:35;36:39;"I think it was like a hip New York City club for a few years"
36:39;36:40;"Maybe it was a bar and grill"
36:40;36:45;"So a bar and grill is a place where you can go up post-sub at the bar and have a drink"
36:45;36:48;"Or you can be seated and there's table service"
36:48;36:50;"Yeah, I mean, it's like an Applebee's or a Chili's"
36:50;36:54;"That's like the sh*tty modern corporate version of like the 70s bar and grill"
36:54;36:58;"I'll have you know, Applebee's and Chili's both started in the mid-70s"
36:58;36:59;"Oh god"
36:59;36:59;"In Texas"
37:00;37:05;"So I think, so I think, and so I think, you know, if we're wondering about Phil Lynott"
37:05;37:08;"Singing about Dino's bar and grill, there's a couple options"
37:08;37:12;"One, there is a place in Dublin, Ireland called Dino's bar and grill that exists"
37:12;37:13;"Seems unlikely"
37:13;37:16;"Or, yeah, and like, and like some sort of Americanization's already happening"
37:16;37:18;"In Dublin they have pubs"
37:18;37:19;"Right"
37:19;37:21;"That's the original bar and grill, is a pub"
37:21;37:22;"Because you can usually get food at a pub"
37:22;37:23;"Absolutely"
37:23;37:25;"Or he has like some fantasy of America"
37:25;37:29;"And he's projecting that like Dino's bar and grill someplace in like San Diego"
37:29;37:30;"Right"
37:30;37:32;"And even Dino sounds like more like an American guy"
37:32;37:34;"Yeah, like North Jersey"
37:34;37:34;"Yeah"
37:34;37:36;"Yeah, you remember Mr. Dino's"
37:36;37:39;"Oh yeah, that was the local pizza place by where we grew up with Mr. Dino's"
37:39;37:43;"But something about Friday night they'll be dressed to kill down at Dino's bar and grill"
37:43;37:46;"Has always been super evocative to me"
37:46;37:46;"Right"
37:46;37:48;"It's so specific and it's so funny"
37:48;37:52;"But also it's sung with such like emotion and heart"
37:52;37:53;"Yeah, there's no joke in there"
37:53;37:55;"No, there's zero joke"
37:55;37:56;"Which is another like a thing about Thin Lizzy"
37:56;38:00;"Like a lot of their songs, especially like the later material"
38:00;38:01;"There is a lot of humor in it"
38:01;38:06;"And I don't know the extent to which it was deliberately kind of funny"
38:06;38:07;"You know that song, Cowboy Song?"
38:07;38:08;"Yeah, maybe we should get into that one"
38:08;38:09;"Yeah"
38:09;38:12;"That's probably one of their best known songs after the boys are back in town"
38:12;38:13;"Same record, Jailbreak"
38:13;38:14;"Oh"
38:14;38:15;"From '76"
38:15;38:17;"Opening lyrics of Cowboy Song are"
38:17;38:20;"I am just a cowboy, lonesome on the plane"
38:20;38:21;"No, no, sorry, I f***ed it up"
38:21;38:22;"I f***ed it up"
38:22;38:25;"But wait, I am just a cowboy"
38:25;38:27;"Lonely on the trail, Lonesome on the Trail"
38:27;38:28;"Yeah, Lonesome on the Trail"
38:28;38:31;"Lord, I'm just thinking about a certain female"
38:31;38:33;"Which also, we were talking about this earlier"
38:33;38:37;"The concept of calling a woman a female seemed so '70s too"
38:37;38:38;"And hilarious"
38:38;38:40;"A female"
38:40;38:42;"Do you think he meant it as a joke?"
38:42;38:42;"No"
38:42;38:44;"Like it's a bad rhyme"
38:44;38:45;"Lonesome on the Trail"
38:45;38:47;"Lord, I'm just thinking about a certain female"
38:47;38:47;"I mean"
38:47;38:49;"It's almost like proto R. Kelly"
38:49;38:50;"Yeah, in a way"
38:50;38:52;"What do you think, Emma?"
38:52;38:54;"You're the only woman on the panel today"
38:54;38:59;"What do you think it implies to call somebody a female versus a woman?"
38:59;39:00;"What does it connote?"
39:00;39:01;"It's hard to say"
39:01;39:03;"I mean, I think it's better than"
39:03;39:06;"I think a lot of people have a problem with calling women girls"
39:06;39:07;"Adult women, girls"
39:07;39:12;"But there's no real casual equivalent for guy or a woman, you know?"
39:12;39:14;"There's guys and men"
39:14;39:15;"And then there's girls"
39:15;39:16;"Well, it's dolls"
39:16;39:17;"Guys and dolls"
39:17;39:18;"Right"
39:18;39:21;"So, but yeah, I think a female"
39:21;39:23;"I don't know if I've ever heard that used"
39:23;39:24;"Yeah, a certain female"
39:24;39:25;"It does sound kind of R&B"
39:25;39:28;"I can't think of another use of the word female in a song"
39:28;39:30;"Usually it's like, ""Babe"""
39:30;39:30;"Right"
39:30;39:31;"You know, that kind of stuff"
39:31;39:35;"So it's my instinct to say it's sincere and it's not offensive"
39:35;39:36;"It's a forced bad rhyme"
39:36;39:39;"But again, it's sung with such feeling"
39:39;39:43;"Well, it also just seems very uncowboyish to say female"
39:43;39:43;"But whatever"
39:43;39:45;"I mean, it's an anachronism"
39:45;39:49;"Yeah, this is basically him digging into every trope of American cowboy songs"
39:49;39:51;"And just jamming them all into one song"
39:51;39:53;"And maybe getting it a little wrong"
39:53;39:53;"Yeah"
39:53;39:55;"All right, so here's Thin Lizzy with ""Cowboy Song"""
39:56;39:59;"I am just a cowboy"
39:59;40:03;"Lonesome on the trail"
40:03;40:08;"The starry night"
40:08;40:10;"The campfire light"
40:10;40:18;"The coyote call"
40:18;40:24;"And the howling wind's wheel"
40:24;40:33;"So I'll ride out to the old sundown"
40:33;40:56;"I am just a cowboy"
40:56;41:00;"Lonesome on the trail"
41:02;41:05;"Lord, I'm just thinking 'bout a certain female"
41:05;41:10;"The nights we spent together"
41:10;41:14;"Riding on the road"
41:14;41:17;"Looking back"
41:17;41:20;"It didn't seem so strange"
41:20;41:27;"Roll me over and turn me around"
41:27;41:29;"Left me keep standing 'til I hit the ground"
41:30;41:33;"Roll me over and let me go"
41:33;41:36;"Right near the rodeo"
41:36;41:39;"I was took in Texas"
41:39;41:43;"I did not know her name"
41:43;41:49;"Lord, all these southern girls, they seem the same"
41:49;41:54;"Down below the water"
41:54;41:57;"In a town in Mexico"
42:00;42:03;"I got my job, bustin' bras for the rodeo"
42:03;42:10;"Roll me over and turn me around"
42:10;42:12;"Left me keep spinning 'til I hit the ground"
42:12;42:16;"Roll me over and let me go"
42:16;42:19;"Running free with a buffalo"

45:11;45:14;"Interesting."
45:14;45:15;"Both those songs are off the"
45:15;45:17;"Jailbreak album from '76"
45:17;45:18;"which was their big commercial"
45:18;45:19;"breakthrough."
45:19;45:20;"They had been grinding it out"
45:20;45:23;"for a good seven years prior to"
45:23;45:24;"that, putting out a lot of"
45:24;45:25;"records, a lot of lineup changes"
45:25;45:26;"in the band."
45:26;45:27;"A lot of the records went"
45:27;45:29;"nowhere, kind of touring a lot."
45:29;45:30;"They kind of had their sound"
45:30;45:32;"developed from the get-go and it"
45:32;45:34;"took a while for their sound to"
45:34;45:35;"sync up with sort of what was"
45:35;45:36;"going to be popular at the time."
45:36;45:37;"We could listen to the first"
45:37;45:39;"song off their first record."
45:39;45:40;"Yeah, let's put it in contrast."
45:40;45:41;"Let's go back to the very start."
45:41;45:42;"Yeah."
45:42;45:43;"What's that, the friendly ranger"
45:43;45:45;"at Klontarf Castle?"
45:45;45:46;"Exactly."
45:46;45:47;"It sounds like a Wes Anderson"
45:47;45:48;"movie."
45:48;45:49;"Yeah."
45:49;45:50;"He's probably a Thin Lizzy fan."
45:50;45:51;"One interesting thing about"
45:51;45:53;"Thin Lizzy is that now we kind of"
45:53;45:55;"take it for granted that because"
45:55;45:57;"U2 became one of the biggest"
45:57;45:58;"bands in the world, I think we"
45:58;45:59;"take it for granted that"
45:59;46:01;"musicians from Ireland can take"
46:01;46:02;"over."
46:02;46:06;"U2, Riverdance, Van Morrison."
46:06;46:07;"The Coors."
46:07;46:09;"Okay, I'm not counting Van"
46:09;46:10;"Morrison."
46:10;46:11;"Elvis Costello?"
46:11;46:12;"Wait, okay."
46:12;46:13;"Elvis Costello, I believe, is of"
46:13;46:14;"Irish descent."
46:14;46:15;"Oh, he came up through London."
46:15;46:16;"I got you."
46:16;46:17;"Yeah, I mean, I think he was"
46:17;46:18;"born and raised in the UK."
46:18;46:20;"But for Thin Lizzy at the time,"
46:20;46:21;"Ireland, first of all, is a very"
46:21;46:22;"small country."
46:22;46:23;"Yeah."
46:23;46:24;"You know the population of"
46:24;46:25;"Ireland is?"
46:25;46:26;"No."
46:26;46:27;"It's like four million."
46:27;46:28;"Really?"
46:28;46:29;"Wow."
46:29;46:30;"Yeah, so about the same size as"
46:30;46:31;"LA."
46:31;46:32;"And I think at the time, being a"
46:32;46:34;"band from Ireland was probably"
46:34;46:35;"not that different than being a"
46:35;46:37;"band from Denmark or something."
46:37;46:38;"You know, an incredibly rich"
46:38;46:39;"musical history, but just in"
46:39;46:41;"terms of on the world stage."
46:41;46:42;"Sure, sure."
46:42;46:43;"Outside of it, for sure."
46:43;46:44;"Right."
46:44;46:45;"And as a band, I mean, they were"
46:45;46:46;"unique."
46:46;46:47;"I mean, Phil Lynott, who was the"
46:47;46:49;"lead singer and guitar and bass"
46:49;46:50;"player and songwriter, was a"
46:50;46:52;"black Irishman, which was a"
46:52;46:54;"really interesting visual"
46:54;46:55;"component of the band because it"
46:55;46:57;"was like two other guys with this"
46:57;46:58;"long blonde hair and then the"
46:58;46:59;"black Irishman playing bass up"
46:59;47:01;"front with the huge afro."
47:01;47:03;"And also he was like proudly"
47:03;47:04;"Irish."
47:04;47:05;"There's like a lot of Irish"
47:05;47:06;"mythology and stuff."
47:06;47:07;"Yeah, in the early records, they"
47:07;47:08;"really, like Whiskey in the Jar,"
47:08;47:09;"that kind of stuff, they are"
47:09;47:11;"taking the sort of ancient"
47:11;47:13;"Celtic songs and then making them"
47:13;47:14;"into these rock songs."
47:14;47:15;"And it's funny, too, because"
47:15;47:17;"it's like there is a lot of local"
47:17;47:18;"Irish energy in their music, but"
47:18;47:20;"it's also this like weirdly"
47:20;47:22;"international language of rock"
47:22;47:23;"and roll."
47:23;47:24;"I guess in this first song that"
47:24;47:25;"we're going to hear after the"
47:25;47:26;"first song on their first"
47:26;47:27;"record, the friendly ranger at"
47:27;47:31;"Clontarf Castle, it opens with a"
47:31;47:32;"spoken word piece that has this"
47:32;47:34;"kind of like psychedelic"
47:34;47:35;"Hendrix vibe."
47:35;47:36;"And you can kind of hear his"
47:36;47:37;"Irish accent."
47:37;47:38;"Yeah."
47:38;47:39;"And then they kind of kick in,"
47:39;47:40;"the band drops in and he starts"
47:40;47:42;"singing and it turns into this"
47:42;47:44;"like very distinctive vocal"
47:44;47:45;"singing mode."
47:45;47:46;"Like I said, it stops sounding"
47:46;47:47;"Irish."
47:47;47:49;"It just turns into his like rock"
47:49;47:50;"voice."
47:50;47:51;"Right."
47:51;47:52;"Which he had developed like from"
47:52;47:53;"the get go."
47:53;47:54;"Right."
47:54;47:55;"Well, yeah, I'm excited to hear"
47:55;47:56;"this."
47:56;47:57;"And then it goes out with"
47:57;47:58;"harmonized guitars."
47:58;47:59;"The drums are super nimble and"
47:59;48:00;"light."
48:00;48:01;"It's really sparse."
48:01;48:02;"The bass playing is like driving"
48:02;48:03;"the whole song."
48:03;48:04;"It's so good."
48:04;48:05;"Anyway, let's get in."
48:11;48:13;"The friendly ranger paused and"
48:13;48:15;"scooping a bowl of beans,"
48:15;48:17;"spreading them like stars,"
48:17;48:19;"falling like justice on different"
48:19;48:21;"scenes."
48:21;48:23;"I'm damned, indeed comrade, I'm"
48:23;48:25;"being bombed and all the people's"
48:25;48:30;"faces turn strawberry blonde."
48:30;48:32;"By the morning gate, the friendly"
48:32;48:34;"ranger waits for the sun making"
48:34;48:36;"sure it's not late."
48:36;48:38;"Just in time, no need to fear,"
48:38;48:40;"well just in case and all the"
48:40;48:44;"people are happy for another year."
48:44;48:46;"And in the evening shade he climbs"
48:46;48:52;"upon the sun, getting its glow."
48:52;48:56;"He goes on, singing the song."
49:10;49:12;"To feel the goodness glowing"
49:12;49:15;"inside, to walk down the street"
49:15;49:18;"with my arms about your hips,"
49:18;49:22;"side by side."
49:22;49:24;"To play with the sad eyed child"
49:24;49:27;"till he smiles, to look at the"
49:27;49:30;"starry sky at night, realize the"
49:30;49:33;"miles."
49:33;49:36;"To see the sunset behind the"
49:36;49:39;"steeple, clonk, clonk, castle,"
49:39;49:45;"no king, queen or nightly people."
49:45;49:49;"Cold by and it's pouring rain,"
49:49;49:51;"to wave goodbye to a very good"
49:51;49:58;"friend, never meet again."
49:58;50:02;"Little thoughts bring little"
50:02;50:08;"memories of you to me."
51:04;51:07;"- Than Lizzie with the friendly"
51:07;51:09;"ranger at Clontarf Castle."
51:09;51:10;"So Jay, we had some discussion"
51:10;51:11;"in the studio before."
51:11;51:12;"- Yeah."
51:12;51:13;"- Now you were describing Phil"
51:13;51:14;"Lynott."
51:14;51:15;"- Lynott."
51:15;51:16;"- Phil Lynott."
51:16;51:17;"- I think that's how you said it."
51:17;51:18;"- As being black Irish because"
51:18;51:20;"he was a person of partial"
51:20;51:22;"African descent but also Irish"
51:22;51:23;"nationality."
51:23;51:24;"- Right."
51:24;51:25;"- But our producer in the studio"
51:25;51:26;"is pointing out that there's"
51:26;51:28;"another meaning for the phrase"
51:28;51:29;"black Irish."
51:29;51:30;"- Which was?"
51:30;51:31;"- Which I think just means when"
51:31;51:33;"you're Irish and you have kind of"
51:33;51:35;"like darker skin and darker hair."
51:35;51:36;"- Huh."
51:36;51:37;"- As opposed to being fair and"
51:37;51:38;"having red hair."
51:38;51:39;"- Right."
51:39;51:40;"- As opposed to being, yeah,"
51:40;51:42;"like super white with freckles"
51:42;51:43;"and red hair which is one"
51:43;51:44;"classic Irish look."
51:44;51:45;"The way it's been explained to"
51:45;51:48;"me is that Colin Farrell is a"
51:48;51:50;"classic example of being, of"
51:50;51:51;"what it means to be black Irish."
51:51;51:52;"- Ah."
51:52;51:53;"- I guess the term would be"
51:53;51:54;"African Irish."
51:54;51:55;"- Yeah."
51:55;51:57;"- For Phil Lynott."
51:57;51:58;"- I think his father might have"
51:58;51:59;"been African American and his"
51:59;52:00;"mother was Irish."
52:00;52:01;"- Okay."
52:01;52:02;"- So yeah, he's African Irish."
52:02;52:03;"- African Irish."
52:03;52:04;"- Are you Irish at all?"
52:04;52:05;"- Maybe mildly."
52:05;52:07;"A lot of, like I, mildly Irish."
52:07;52:08;"- Mildly Irish."
52:09;52:10;"There's like a mix of British"
52:10;52:12;"Isle stuff happening."
52:12;52:13;"- Right, Western European."
52:13;52:14;"Okay, so I think you've made a"
52:14;52:15;"strong case for Thin Lizzy."
52:15;52:17;"Notice how I haven't said this"
52:17;52:18;"whole show that you think Thin"
52:18;52:20;"Lizzy are trash."
52:20;52:22;"'Cause I think actually Thin Lizzy"
52:22;52:24;"resonates with the kids today."
52:24;52:26;"- What do you think, Ezra/Emma?"
52:26;52:28;"Kane Higgs?"
52:28;52:30;"- I think Thin Lizzy are great."
52:30;52:31;"I love their sound."
52:31;52:32;"That's the kind of rock music"
52:32;52:34;"that I like, is like minimalist"
52:34;52:36;"stuff, I like the guitar sound."
52:36;52:37;"And there's that feeling that"
52:37;52:39;"it's like proto-New Wave to me."
52:39;52:41;"That's what I like."
52:41;52:42;"I like that and I like Dino's"
52:42;52:43;"Barn Girl."
52:43;52:45;"Okay, Jake, so let's wrap things"
52:45;52:47;"up with one last song from Thin"
52:47;52:49;"Lizzy, Phil and the Boys."
52:49;52:50;"- Okay."
52:50;52:52;"Let's do another one off of"
52:52;52:53;"Jailbreak."
52:53;52:55;"One of my favorite songs by them"
52:55;52:57;"is called Running Back."
52:57;52:58;"And it's just like an awesome"
52:58;53:00;"little pop song."
53:03;53:29;"♪ I'm a fool now that it's over"
53:29;53:34;"♪ Can you guess my name"
53:34;53:35;"♪ I make my money singing"
53:35;53:37;"♪ Songs about you"
53:37;53:41;"♪ It's my claim to fame"
53:41;53:44;"♪ When they say it's over"
53:44;53:45;"♪ It's not all over"
53:45;53:48;"♪ There's still the pain"
53:48;53:50;"♪ And I'd come running"
53:50;53:51;"♪ I'd come running"
53:51;53:54;"♪ Back to you again"
53:54;53:57;"♪ Oh, I'd come running"
53:57;53:58;"♪ I'd come running"
53:58;54:02;"♪ Back to you again"
54:02;54:05;"♪ If I said I was sorry"
54:05;54:09;"♪ Would you still leave me"
54:09;54:11;"♪ I never thought you'd go"
54:11;54:13;"♪ 'Til you did"
54:13;54:16;"♪ Believe me"
54:16;54:19;"♪ When they say it's over"
54:19;54:23;"♪ It's not all over"
54:23;54:25;"♪ Completely"
54:25;54:26;"♪ 'Cause I'd come running"
54:26;54:29;"♪ I'd come running"
54:29;54:32;"♪ Back to you again"
54:32;54:35;"♪ Yes, I'd come running"
54:35;54:40;"♪ I'd come running"
54:40;54:43;"♪ Back to you again"
54:46;54:49;"♪ I miss that girl"
54:56;55:17;"♪ The show is over"
55:17;55:21;"♪ And we must all go home"
55:21;55:23;"♪ Just leave me by myself"
55:23;55:28;"♪ I'll be all right here on my own"
55:28;55:30;"♪ If it's all over"
55:30;55:32;"♪ It's all over"
55:32;55:35;"♪ And I'm all alone"
55:35;55:36;"♪ And I'd come running"
55:36;55:38;"♪ I'd come running"
55:38;55:40;"♪ Back to you again"
55:40;55:43;"♪ Don't you know I'd come running"
55:43;55:44;"♪ I'd come running"
55:44;55:47;"♪ Back to you again"
55:47;55:48;"♪ Now"
55:48;55:53;"♪ Oh ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma"
55:53;56:00;"♪ Oh tra la la la la la la la la la la la la la la"
56:00;56:02;"♪ Now"
56:02;56:05;"♪ Oh na na na na na na na na"
56:05;56:07;"- That was Thin Lizzy with ""Running Back."""
56:07;56:09;"- And that wraps up our Thin Lizzy segment."
56:09;56:13;"Thank you, Jake, for teaching the world"
56:13;56:15;"- Absolutely. - About Thin Lizzy in 2015."
56:15;56:20;"- You're listening to ""Time Crisis"" on Beats 1."
56:20;56:22;"- We've just been joined in the studio"
56:22;56:25;"by your brother, Dave Longstrap."
56:25;56:28;"Thanks for being here. [laughter]"
56:28;56:30;"Thanks for coming, Dave. - Good to be here."
56:30;56:34;"- We opened up the questions bag recently on Twitter,"
56:34;56:36;"and 'cause it's your first time on the show,"
56:36;56:37;"maybe we'll just get things started"
56:37;56:39;"by asking you a few random Internet questions."
56:39;56:41;"- Oh, Jesus. - First one."
56:41;56:43;"This is an interesting question."
56:43;56:46;"You think Obama has ever watched ""Hentai""?"
56:46;56:47;"No, I don't. Okay."
56:47;56:48;"- What's ""Hentai""?"
56:48;56:51;"- ""Hentai"" is, like, anime porn. - Anime porn."
56:51;56:54;"- There was a funny time where Obama was, like--"
56:54;56:55;"I think he was in Japan,"
56:55;56:58;"or maybe he was hosting the Japanese prime minister,"
56:58;57:01;"and he was, like, kind of shouting him out,"
57:01;57:02;"and in his speech he said..."
57:02;57:05;"- Today's also a chance for Americans,"
57:05;57:06;"especially our young people,"
57:06;57:10;"to say thank you for all the things we love from Japan,"
57:10;57:14;"like karate and karaoke. - Karaoke."
57:14;57:16;"- Manga. - Manga."
57:16;57:18;"- And anime. - Anime."
57:18;57:21;"- And, of course, emojis."
57:21;57:25;"- Basically, he's saying karaoke, anime, and manga."
57:25;57:26;"- Oh. - I mean, I'm saying it"
57:26;57:27;"with my American accent. - Yeah, yeah."
57:27;57:29;"- Probably somebody briefed him and was like,"
57:29;57:31;"""This is the most Japanese way to say it."""
57:31;57:34;"But so the-- and you can tell-- look at the video."
57:34;57:36;"The Japanese prime minister is kind of just, like,"
57:36;57:39;"so, like, kind of, like, shocked and amused by it."
57:39;57:41;"""In America, we love your karaoke, anime."""
57:41;57:43;"George Bush never would have done that."
57:43;57:46;"- Anime. - Manga."
57:46;57:49;"- Obama just has the deepest Texan drawl."
57:49;57:52;"- Anime. - Anime."
57:52;57:54;"- Karaoke. - Karaoke."
57:54;57:56;"- Here's an interesting one, Dave."
57:56;58:00;"This comes from a Twitter user, existentialbree."
58:00;58:02;"""In a postmodern, hyper-real world,"
58:02;58:05;"is music a fashion choice in musicians' designers?"""
58:05;58:08;"- Sure. - You heard it here first."
58:08;58:10;"Existentialbree."
58:10;58:12;"- I'm not into that. - You're not into that?"
58:12;58:15;"- No. You know, giving in. - Giving into what? Fashion?"
58:15;58:17;"- Just nothing meaning anything."
58:17;58:20;"- The three of us have kind of had a similar conversation before."
58:20;58:22;"And Ezra, I always remember when you were like,"
58:22;58:25;"""Music is, like, one part fashion and one part art."""
58:25;58:27;"- Did I say that? - Yeah, you did."
58:27;58:29;"- I stand by that. - Yeah. And--"
58:29;58:30;"- Although maybe it's shifted."
58:30;58:32;"Maybe today, if you're cooking up some music,"
58:32;58:34;"you might want to add two parts fashion,"
58:34;58:37;"one part art to one part art."
58:37;58:38;"- New recipe."
58:38;58:40;"- See, I liked it when it was one-to-one."
58:40;58:42;"- Who do you feel like is a classic example?"
58:42;58:44;"- Of one-to-one ratio? - One-to-one."
58:44;58:46;"- The Beatles. - Right. And a lot of people--"
58:46;58:47;"I think we should point out that a lot of people"
58:47;58:50;"are sitting at home saying, ""I don't think the Beatles--"
58:50;58:51;"with fashion."""
58:51;58:54;"But the truth is, the Beatles, from day one,"
58:54;58:56;"they were wearing a very specific type of suit."
58:56;58:58;"They were wearing those collarless suits."
58:58;59:00;"- That was Brian Epstein's idea. - Oh, was it his idea?"
59:00;59:02;"- Mm-hmm. They hated those suits."
59:02;59:05;"The long hair. Plus, I mean, changing the look of every album."
59:05;59:07;"- They were all dressing the same way."
59:07;59:09;"It was, like, super concerted. It was the first boy band."
59:09;59:11;"But what's weird to receive that music"
59:11;59:13;"as, like, the children of boomers"
59:13;59:16;"is that the fashion has faded,"
59:16;59:21;"and we're more inclined to just see it as, like, the music."
59:21;59:23;"- Right. - The art part of it."
59:23;59:24;"The fashion is disposable."
59:24;59:26;"- And so that's why you get a lot of people today saying,"
59:26;59:28;"""Oh, look at all these people."
59:28;59:30;"Look at Miley Cyrus doing this and that."""
59:30;59:32;"The Beatles used to be about the music."
59:32;59:34;"If you look at Sgt. Peppers,"
59:34;59:36;"that's one of the most fashion-y,"
59:36;59:39;"artificial, weird albums ever."
59:39;59:41;"You know, we just got a follow-up question, Dave."
59:41;59:43;"I'm curious to hear this from you. Favorite Beatles song?"
59:43;59:46;"- I don't know. That's hard. - Least favorite Beatles song?"
59:46;59:48;"- Um, maybe, um,"

01:11:22;01:11:24;"and you had no idea that he was singing ""Cheerleader""?"
01:11:24;01:11:26;"No, I was just content-- # Cheerleader #"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"content to hear the melody"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"without knowing what the words were."
01:11:30;01:11:32;"Well, it's a beautiful song."
01:11:32;01:11:34;"So I guess-- so we're off to an interesting start."
01:11:34;01:11:36;"I think our first piece of evidence suggests"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"that 2015 is better than 1985."
01:11:38;01:11:40;"[laughter]"
01:11:40;01:11:43;"And also more nuanced in feeling."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"I love that he's talking about, like--"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"I don't really feel that way."
01:11:47;01:11:49;"It's like just a shade of a feeling."
01:11:49;01:11:51;"Whereas Huey Lewis is talking about this"
01:11:51;01:11:53;"just, like, power of love."
01:11:53;01:11:54;"That sounds like-- I don't know."
01:11:54;01:11:56;"Right, that's when people use propagandist--"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"Like, yeah, when people believe"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"that their narrative was universally true."
01:12:00;01:12:01;"Right."
01:12:01;01:12:02;"Now it's more specific."
01:12:02;01:12:04;"Yeah, and I also just want to point out"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"another way to compare these songs is"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"""Omi,"" ""Cheerleader,"" the big hit version"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"is a remix by, like, a German teenager."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"Omi's from Jamaica."
01:12:12;01:12:14;"So this song is a Jamaican guy"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"and a German guy who never met"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"making a hit song together."
01:12:18;01:12:20;"Whereas the power of love is Huey Lewis and the News,"
01:12:20;01:12:22;"a bunch of guys from the Bay Area."
01:12:22;01:12:24;"From Marin County."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"A Marin County bar band."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"Bar and grill band."
01:12:28;01:12:30;"A bar and grill band,"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"which is not necessarily a bad thing."
01:12:32;01:12:34;"Okay, so now let's go back to 1985."
01:12:34;01:12:36;"The number four song this week in 1985."
01:12:36;01:12:38;"Man, I don't really remember this song."
01:12:38;01:12:40;"This is ""Cool and the Gang,"""
01:12:40;01:12:42;"who are an amazing band, with ""Cherish."""
01:12:42;01:12:44;"I feel like it's gonna be a ballad?"

01:14:03;01:14:05;"I think--no, this is the chorus."

01:14:07;01:14:09;"that first section was so weak and neither of us--"

01:15:24;01:15:25;"Bernie gotta do that."
01:15:25;01:15:28;"Yeah, Bernie wouldn't do that."
01:15:28;01:15:30;"No. Sure he would. No he won't."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"We'll see."
01:15:31;01:15:33;"Bernie's saving up for a far more elaborate dance."

01:15:42;01:15:45;"What do you guys think about Hillary? We were asked about Bernie earlier."
01:15:45;01:15:47;"Who asked you about Bernie? Oh, somebody on Twitter?"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"Yeah, somebody from the question bag."
01:15:49;01:15:51;"I can't get excited about Hillary."
01:15:51;01:15:55;"I mean, so you imagine 1985."
01:15:55;01:15:55;"Reagan was-"
01:15:55;01:15:57;"They're chilling in Little Rock."
01:15:57;01:15:59;"They're chilling in Little Rock. Reagan is president."
01:15:59;01:16:01;"The actor?"
01:16:01;01:16:02;"The actor."
01:16:02;01:16:03;"Good call."
01:16:03;01:16:04;"Back to the future."
01:16:04;01:16:07;"Who's president in 1985, future boy?"
01:16:07;01:16:14;"30 years later, Hillary might be president and she's whipping and nae-nae-ing on TV."
01:16:14;01:16:16;"I mean, that's just sad pandering."
01:16:16;01:16:17;"It's just like-"
01:16:17;01:16:19;"Is it? Maybe she wants to whip, man."
01:16:19;01:16:21;"Maybe that's her true soul."
01:16:21;01:16:23;"Do you guys honestly think that for one second?"
01:16:23;01:16:24;"No."
01:16:24;01:16:27;"It was clearly her like communications director was like,"
01:16:27;01:16:31;"""This is a popular song and we have this TV appearance lined up with-"""
01:16:31;01:16:32;"Was it Ellen?"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"It was Ellen, yes."
01:16:34;01:16:36;"It's just like-"
01:16:36;01:16:37;"There's just- I mean, you know."
01:16:37;01:16:37;"Well, also-"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"Maybe I'm being too like real."
01:16:39;01:16:42;"That's that part of politics where like though you have to-"
01:16:42;01:16:47;"It's about drawing together, you know, different constituencies."
01:16:47;01:16:49;"Why not? She's dancing."
01:16:49;01:16:51;"It's about going viral in 2015."
01:16:51;01:16:54;"She's trying to go viral. She just wants to get those clicks."
01:16:54;01:16:56;"But in the most inauthentic way."
01:16:56;01:16:58;"Bernie's going viral on his own terms."
01:16:58;01:16:59;"Yeah."
01:16:59;01:16:59;"I don't think anyone sees-"
01:16:59;01:17:02;"What's an example of Bernie's virality though?"
01:17:02;01:17:05;"He's leading in the polls in New Hampshire and Iowa."
01:17:05;01:17:10;"He's doing okay, but deep down, Jake, you're a huge music fan, right?"
01:17:10;01:17:10;"Yeah."
01:17:10;01:17:13;"Music's a big part of your life, including popular music."
01:17:13;01:17:13;"Yeah."
01:17:13;01:17:21;"And would you rather have a president who's committed to closing the income gap and, you know,"
01:17:21;01:17:26;"bombing other countries less or a president who actually has their finger on the pulse of pop culture?"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"You're right, Ezra."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"Hillary 2016."
01:17:29;01:17:35;"When I think of a candidate that has their finger on the pulse of pop culture, it's obviously Hillary."
01:17:35;01:17:38;"That's right. Compared to Bernie. She makes Bernie look old."
01:17:38;01:17:44;"So we've established across the board enthusiastic support for Hillary Clinton in the Time Crisis Studio."
01:17:44;01:17:49;"Back to 1985, Hillary's in Little Rock with Bill."
01:17:49;01:17:52;"This was the number three song on the charts."
01:17:52;01:17:54;"This was by a little band called Dire Straits."
01:17:54;01:17:55;"Oh."
01:17:55;01:17:57;"Money for nothing."
01:18:53;01:18:59;"So that was the number three song on the charts in 1985, Money for Nothing by Dire Straits."
01:18:59;01:19:04;"In the full version, that song is eight minutes and 26 seconds."
01:19:04;01:19:05;"That's amazing."
01:19:05;01:19:06;"Which is crazy."
01:19:06;01:19:07;"Amazing?"
01:19:07;01:19:08;"I don't know if it's amazing."
01:19:08;01:19:11;"Well, by amazing, I mean appalling."
01:19:11;01:19:12;"Appalling."
01:19:12;01:19:18;"The number three song on the charts in 2015 is by another foreigner."
01:19:18;01:19:20;"Dire Straits were from England."
01:19:20;01:19:22;"This is another foreigner, Justin Bieber from Canada."
01:19:22;01:19:24;"What do you mean?"
01:19:24;01:19:26;"Coming in at a lean three minutes and 28."
01:19:26;01:19:28;"You guys already know I love this song."
01:19:31;01:19:33;"You know what I realized the other day when I heard this on the radio?"
01:19:33;01:19:34;"That's a clock ticking."
01:19:34;01:19:36;"Yeah, I was just thinking that."
01:19:50;01:19:54;"Yeah, the stuff from '85 is sounding super stiff."
01:19:54;01:19:56;"2015 is mopping the floor."
01:19:56;01:19:58;"Kind of is."
01:19:58;01:20:00;"It's sounding so, yeah, one-dimensional."
01:20:04;01:20:06;"The pitch bending on the pan flutes."
01:20:06;01:20:08;"Have you seen the video for this?"
01:20:08;01:20:11;"There's all these drawings projected on him while he's dancing."
01:20:11;01:20:12;"Oh, and he's like killing people."
01:20:12;01:20:13;"No."
01:20:13;01:20:14;"Yeah."
01:20:14;01:20:15;"No, that's --"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"No, no, you're thinking of Where Are You Now, maybe."
01:20:17;01:20:18;"Oh."
01:20:18;01:20:19;"Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right."
01:20:19;01:20:21;"Where Are You Now, what do you mean?"
01:20:21;01:20:24;"This is kind of like the game, that movie with Michael Douglas."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"Right, that's the one I'm thinking of."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"Yeah."
01:20:26;01:20:27;"Fincher film."
01:20:27;01:20:29;"Number three on the charts, Justin Bieber, What Do You Mean?"
01:20:29;01:20:33;"Clearly a superior song to Money for Nothing by dire straits."
01:20:33;01:20:35;"The entire studio is in agreement."
01:20:35;01:20:37;"Such a beautiful song."
01:20:37;01:20:40;"You know, it was interesting, Dave, you were pointing out how all that music from the '80s"
01:20:40;01:20:45;"has this kind of like aggressive, like, rightness, like cheerleader."
01:20:45;01:20:47;"It's almost like, ooh, I think I found myself a cheerleader."
01:20:47;01:20:50;"That stuff from the '80s is like, it's the power of love."
01:20:50;01:20:51;"Yeah."
01:20:51;01:20:52;"It's almost like it's aggressive."
01:20:52;01:20:55;"It's very sure of itself."
01:20:55;01:20:59;"One thing that's interesting about Justin Bieber lately is he's become pop music's question king."
01:20:59;01:21:00;"What do you mean?"
01:21:00;01:21:01;"He's asking questions."
01:21:02;01:21:03;"What do you mean?"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"And the big single this summer was Where Are You Now."
01:21:05;01:21:07;"New phone, who is this?"
01:21:07;01:21:08;"That's a new single."
01:21:08;01:21:09;"That's dropping next week."
01:21:09;01:21:11;"Who's this?"
01:21:11;01:21:17;"So Justin Bieber, one of the biggest pop stars in the world, he's asking questions."
01:21:17;01:21:21;"In the '80s, pop stars would just come out and say declarative statements."
01:21:21;01:21:22;"Wow."
01:21:22;01:21:23;"Love this."
01:21:23;01:21:26;"Wait, Jake, think of a song in the '80s where they're asking questions."
01:21:26;01:21:28;"God, put me on the spot."
01:21:28;01:21:31;"There's got to be an epic one."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"I don't think so."
01:21:32;01:21:34;"All I'm saying is Justin Bieber."
01:21:34;01:21:35;"Reagan had the answers."
01:21:35;01:21:40;"No, because Ronald Reagan, he was all about this kind of old school American narrative."
01:21:40;01:21:44;"He was all about fighting the evil empire, black and white, right?"
01:21:44;01:21:47;"Whereas today, it's all gray."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"It's gray."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"We got Obama talking about anima."
01:21:49;01:21:55;"You could say Springsteen, born in the USA, was a question."
01:21:55;01:22:00;"It was a question disguised as an authoritative statement."
01:22:00;01:22:07;"It's a very triumphant, huge chorus declaring that I was born in the USA, but then the verses"
01:22:07;01:22:11;"are all just about these sad Vietnam vets that can't get jobs."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"So it is sort of like a question."
01:22:13;01:22:15;"It's a stretch."
01:22:15;01:22:18;"Justin Bieber is much better at posing questions than Springsteen."
01:22:18;01:22:20;"Let's get back to 19--"
01:22:20;01:22:26;"When it comes to ambiguity and rich songwriting, Bieber is just crushing Springsteen."
01:22:26;01:22:27;"That's right."
01:22:27;01:22:30;"Bieber Clinton 2016."
01:22:30;01:22:33;"Let's get back to 1985."
01:22:33;01:22:38;"Wow, a lot of soundtrack songs were in the charts in 1985 because we had the Power of"
01:22:38;01:22:42;"Love from Back to the Future, and then the number on the charts then was We Don't Need"
01:22:42;01:22:44;"Another Hero from Mad Max."
01:22:44;01:22:49;"Speaking of things coming full circle, we just had a Mad Max film in the theaters 30"
01:22:49;01:22:50;"years ago."
01:22:50;01:22:51;"What did they have?"
01:22:51;01:22:53;"A Mad Max film in the theaters."
01:22:53;01:22:57;"Here's Tina Turner with We Don't Need Another Hero in parentheses."
01:22:57;01:23:01;"Thunderdome."
01:23:01;01:23:04;"It kind of sounds like the Justin Bieber song."
01:23:04;01:23:30;"Wow, she sounds like she's had a rough night."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"Some real character in that voice."
01:23:32;01:23:33;"I like it."
01:23:33;01:23:34;"I don't know this song."
01:23:34;01:23:35;"Some patina."
01:23:35;01:23:36;"You might recognize the chorus."
01:23:37;01:23:38;"I like it."
01:24:11;01:24:15;"That was Tina Turner with We Don't Need Another Hero, Thunderdome from the film Mad Max Beyond"
01:24:15;01:24:16;"Thunderdome."
01:24:16;01:24:18;"That was number two on the charts in 1985."
01:24:18;01:24:20;"What's its counterpart today?"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"Well, it's our old friend The Weeknd."
01:24:22;01:24:25;"He's been tearing up the charts all summer long with The Hills."
01:24:29;01:24:30;"A real hot summer song."
01:24:30;01:24:33;"Wait, is this the 531?"
01:24:33;01:24:34;"Yeah, this is the only one."
01:24:34;01:24:35;"It's half past five."
01:24:38;01:24:40;"What is he saying about Promo?"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"He's saying it's half past five."
01:25:25;01:25:29;"So Dave, to answer your question, the opening lyrics to this song are, ""You're man on the"
01:25:29;01:25:30;"road, he doing promo."
01:25:30;01:25:33;"You said, 'Keep our business on the low low.'"""
01:25:33;01:25:38;"Now, for people who don't work in the music industry, when you're out on the road doing"
01:25:38;01:25:42;"promo, that means you're doing interviews."
01:25:42;01:25:47;"I don't know, what other industries besides showbiz people say people go on the road doing"
01:25:47;01:25:48;"promo?"
01:25:48;01:25:49;"Roofing."
01:25:49;01:25:50;"Farm equipment."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"[laughter]"
01:25:52;01:25:58;"So it sounds to me like The Weeknd is having sex with somebody whose husband probably sells"
01:25:58;01:26:02;"farming equipment, probably out in Nashville for a conference."
01:26:02;01:26:05;"I didn't realize that this song was also about cheating."
01:26:05;01:26:08;"Authorized John Deere dealership."
01:26:08;01:26:13;"And little does he know The Weeknd is up in his mansion in the Hollywood Hills having"
01:26:13;01:26:14;"sex with his girlfriend."
01:26:14;01:26:17;"I don't know, is the Tina Turner song better or The Weeknd song?"
01:26:17;01:26:20;"They're both kind of harsh, kind of dark."
01:26:20;01:26:22;"Both have great voices."
01:26:22;01:26:23;"I think we gotta go to The Weeknd's."
01:26:23;01:26:27;"I think we gotta go to The Weeknd, but I think what we're noticing, as Dave pointed out on"
01:26:27;01:26:30;"the first song, the modern songs have a lot of ambiguity."
01:26:30;01:26:37;"This song is literally about cheating on somebody and you only have sex with them at 5.30am."
01:26:37;01:26:40;"Everything about it is kind of ambiguous."
01:26:40;01:26:41;"What is it?"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"What kind of relationship is that?"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"I guess that's what the song's exploring."
01:26:45;01:26:47;"What does he say on the bridge?"
01:26:47;01:26:48;"On the hills?"
01:26:48;01:26:49;"Yeah."
01:26:49;01:26:50;"Is there, what counts as, oh."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"Hills have eyes, the hills have..."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"[laughter]"
01:26:52;01:26:53;"You know what's really funny?"
01:26:53;01:26:57;"Just reading the lyrics without hearing the music, because this actually sounds like some"
01:26:57;01:26:59;"old timey preacher."
01:26:59;01:27:01;"Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"Who are you to judge?"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"Only you to trust, only you."
01:27:07;01:27:10;"You heard it here first from The Weeknd, the hills have eyes."
01:27:10;01:27:13;"The Hills Have Eyes is a horror film."
01:27:13;01:27:14;"Who are you to judge?"
01:27:15;01:27:19;"It's like The Weeknd is literally looking at the Hollywood hills and saying, don't judge"
01:27:19;01:27:20;"me, hills."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"You're all doing it."
01:27:22;01:27:23;"I like this song."
01:27:23;01:27:24;"This song's growing on me more and more."
01:27:24;01:27:27;"The more we explore the lyrics, I love this song."
01:27:27;01:27:31;"Okay, are you guys ready for the number one songs of 1985 and 2015?"
01:27:31;01:27:32;"Oh yeah."
01:27:32;01:27:37;"The number one song this week in 1985 was also from a film."
01:27:37;01:27:43;"It was from St. Elmo's Fire, and the song is called St. Elmo's Fire by John Parr."
01:27:43;01:27:44;"You guys remember this?"
01:27:44;01:27:45;"Instrumental?"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"My bad."
01:27:47;01:27:49;"You're thinking of Beverly Hills Coffin?"
01:27:49;01:27:50;"Yeah."
01:27:50;01:27:52;"Wait, who is this by?"
01:27:52;01:27:53;"John Parr."
01:27:53;01:28:22;"(singing)"
01:28:22;01:28:27;"Is this the chorus?"
01:28:27;01:28:54;"(singing)"
01:28:54;01:28:57;"Key change was so '80s."
01:28:57;01:29:01;"Wait guys, I don't really know this song well, but I just remembered that I was told a hilarious"
01:29:01;01:29:02;"story about it."
01:29:02;01:29:06;"I don't know this person well, but I spent some time with Rob Lowe once, who was in this"
01:29:06;01:29:08;"film, and he's a big music buff."
01:29:08;01:29:12;"And it was kind of amazing hearing him talk about '80s music."
01:29:12;01:29:14;"And I remember him telling this story, but at the time I didn't know the song that well,"
01:29:14;01:29:16;"so I couldn't really put it into context."
01:29:16;01:29:21;"And he was saying, you know, the theme from St. Elmo's Fire is written by this very famous"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"songwriter, David Foster."
01:29:23;01:29:27;"He's like a very accomplished songwriter, big in the music industry."
01:29:27;01:29:34;"And he told this story that David Foster had agreed to write a theme song for a wheelchair-bound"
01:29:34;01:29:39;"Canadian man who was going across the country."
01:29:39;01:29:43;"And basically, a wheelchair-bound Canadian man who was kind of doing like an inspirational,"
01:29:43;01:29:49;"maybe to raise money, kind of tour across the country where he was going to be making"
01:29:49;01:29:52;"his way across Canada in his wheelchair."
01:29:52;01:29:55;"But he'd also agreed to do the St. Elmo's Fire theme."
01:29:55;01:29:57;"And he didn't have time to write two songs."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"Oh my God."
01:29:58;01:29:59;"So he--"
01:29:59;01:30:00;"Doubled up."
01:30:00;01:30:04;"So he wrote-- so technically, St. Elmo's Fire is called St. Elmo's Fire Man in Motion."
01:30:04;01:30:08;"And if you look at the chorus, it's, ""I can see the new horizon underneath the blazing"
01:30:08;01:30:09;"sky."
01:30:09;01:30:11;"I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher."
01:30:11;01:30:13;"Gonna be your man in motion."
01:30:13;01:30:15;"All I need is a pair of wheels."
01:30:15;01:30:16;"Take me where my future's lying."
01:30:16;01:30:19;"St. Elmo's Fire."""
01:30:19;01:30:20;"That is--"
01:30:20;01:30:22;"I never saw St. Elmo's Fire, but I don't think there's anybody in a wheelchair."
01:30:22;01:30:23;"I don't believe so."
01:30:23;01:30:24;"Never saw it."
01:30:24;01:30:25;"I love it."
01:30:25;01:30:27;"David Foster, you're a legend for that one."
01:30:27;01:30:28;"That's amazing."
01:30:28;01:30:30;"A true pragmatist there."
01:30:30;01:30:32;"A true 1980s--"
01:30:32;01:30:33;"Terrible song."
01:30:33;01:30:34;"OK, yeah."
01:30:34;01:30:37;"We didn't even talk about the quality of the song."
01:30:37;01:30:39;"You're not feeling St. Elmo's Fire?"
01:30:39;01:30:41;"This is the worst thing of the top five."
01:30:41;01:30:43;"That probably was the worst song that we've heard so far."
01:30:43;01:30:45;"But that was number one?"
01:30:45;01:30:46;"That was number one."
01:30:46;01:30:47;"Wow."
01:30:47;01:30:50;"Someone was buying a 7-inch of that, a cassette single."
01:30:50;01:30:52;"B-side, instrumental version?"
01:30:52;01:30:53;"Yeah."
01:30:53;01:30:55;"David Parr, full length."
01:30:55;01:31:01;"I think we're about to come up with the most extreme contrast of our top five experiment."
01:31:01;01:31:06;"The number one song in 1985 was St. Elmo's Fire,"
01:31:06;01:31:11;"this weird half-wheelchair, half '80s movie song."
01:31:11;01:31:17;"And the number one song in 2015 is this gem from The Weeknd."
01:31:17;01:31:23;"[MUSIC - ST. ELMO'S FIRE, ""THE BEST OF ME""]"
01:31:23;01:31:27;"And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb."
01:31:27;01:31:32;"And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come."
01:31:32;01:31:36;"But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young."
01:31:36;01:31:40;"This I know, this I know."
01:31:40;01:31:44;"She told me don't worry about it."
01:31:44;01:31:49;"She told me don't worry no more."
01:31:49;01:31:53;"We both know we can't go without it."
01:31:53;01:31:59;"She told me you'll never be alone."
01:31:59;01:32:05;"I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it."
01:32:05;01:32:08;"But I love it."
01:32:08;01:32:14;"I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it."
01:32:14;01:32:16;"But I love it."
01:32:16;01:32:21;"And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb."
01:32:21;01:32:25;"And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come."
01:32:25;01:32:26;"All the misery--"
01:32:26;01:32:30;"Song of the summer, still number one, The Weeknd with ""Can't Feel My Face."""
01:32:30;01:32:33;"I mean, that's an extreme contrast, St. Elmo's Fire versus ""Can't Feel My Face."""
01:32:33;01:32:35;"That's crazy."
01:32:35;01:32:38;"Again, 2015, mopping the floor."
01:32:38;01:32:39;"Mopping the floor."
01:32:39;01:32:41;"I wouldn't have thought that was the case."
01:32:41;01:32:43;"I want to point out, this was originally Jake's idea to do this segment,"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"was to bring in the top five of 1985."
01:32:45;01:32:47;"Yeah, you didn't think it was going to be this bad."
01:32:47;01:32:48;"I didn't think it would be this bad."
01:32:48;01:32:50;"I mean, I thought '85 would be interesting."
01:32:50;01:32:51;"Right."
01:32:51;01:32:54;"I mean, nice round number 30 years ago."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"Right."
01:32:55;01:33:02;"'95, '75, it seemed like '85 was a good choice, but wow."
01:33:02;01:33:05;"This is also just a very strong top five right now."
01:33:05;01:33:06;"Yes."
01:33:06;01:33:07;"That we're having in 20--"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"Well, you know what's--it's making me--hearing the '85 stuff is making me"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"appreciate the 2015 stuff more."
01:33:11;01:33:14;"If we just did a cold listen on the 2015 stuff--"
01:33:14;01:33:15;"Right."
01:33:15;01:33:18;"--I'd probably be bringing a higher degree of skepticism or something."
01:33:18;01:33:23;"It was something about the compare and contrast and just like--2015 is funky."
01:33:23;01:33:24;"Right."
01:33:24;01:33:27;"Well, I think a lot of people--people always forget how bad the past was"
01:33:27;01:33:30;"because you can look at the past in rose-colored glasses."
01:33:30;01:33:32;"Well, the good stuff rises to the top too."
01:33:32;01:33:38;"I mean, the stuff--the chorus of ""Cherish"" by Kool and the Gang was dope."
01:33:38;01:33:39;"Yes."
01:33:39;01:33:42;"Yeah, I mean, there were good things going on in 1985, right?"
01:33:42;01:33:43;"Yeah."
01:33:43;01:33:44;"I'm not joking."
01:33:44;01:33:45;"For one."
01:33:45;01:33:46;"What was '85?"
01:33:46;01:33:47;"I mean, I'll just say in general--"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"No, maybe ""Making Sense"" was '84."
01:33:49;01:33:50;"I don't know if--"
01:33:50;01:33:51;"""Ghostbusters"" was '84."
01:33:51;01:33:53;"This stuff didn't necessarily come out in 1985, but I'm just saying that was"
01:33:53;01:33:58;"the era of Michael, Prince, Bruce, Madonna."
01:33:58;01:34:02;"Those were the superstars of the era, and that's a pretty idiosyncratic mix."
01:34:02;01:34:04;"Yeah, for sure."
01:34:04;01:34:06;"""WrestleMania,"" that was the first one?"
01:34:06;01:34:08;"The first ""WrestleMania"" was 1985."
01:34:08;01:34:11;"That's actually an interesting--one of our producers is pointing out that"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"the first ""WrestleMania"" was 1985."
01:34:13;01:34:16;"It's interesting because in some ways, modern pop culture actually has learned"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"a lot from ""WrestleMania."""
01:34:18;01:34:20;"Oh, my God, I just realized a really weird thing."
01:34:20;01:34:21;"What?"
01:34:21;01:34:24;"Oh, my God, you guys, I just realized a super weird thing."
01:34:24;01:34:29;"1985, number one single was the questionable song"
01:34:29;01:34:32;"""St. Elmo's Fireman in Motion,"" written by David Foster."
01:34:32;01:34:36;"30 years later, the number one song is ""Can't Feel My Face"" by The Weeknd,"
01:34:36;01:34:40;"and as we were Googling The Weeknd, it said that he's dating"
01:34:40;01:34:43;"something Hadid who is the stepdaughter of David Foster."
01:34:43;01:34:44;"Wow."
01:34:44;01:34:45;"That's crazy."
01:34:45;01:34:46;"Full circle."
01:34:46;01:34:48;"You know what that says to me, though, more than anything?"
01:34:48;01:34:52;"Is that powerful families maintain power at all costs."
01:34:52;01:34:54;"It doesn't surprise me--"
01:34:54;01:34:55;"The kingdom."
01:34:55;01:34:57;"Yeah, that's how power works."
01:34:57;01:35:00;"It doesn't surprise me that two number one singles 30 years apart"
01:35:00;01:35:02;"could all kind of come back to one family."
01:35:02;01:35:04;"That's how America works."
01:35:04;01:35:05;"That's true."
01:35:05;01:35:07;"That's sad and dark and true."
01:35:07;01:35:11;"I realize that I'm--Jake, I see why you like Bernie Sanders better"
01:35:11;01:35:12;"than Hillary Clinton."
01:35:12;01:35:14;"Now I'm starting to see your point."
01:35:14;01:35:17;"I'm just the punk rock idealist over here."
01:35:17;01:35:19;"That was a hell of a top five."
01:35:19;01:35:26;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats 1."
