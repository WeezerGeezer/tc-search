00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, back again. On today's episode, we're joined by very special guest Stephen"
00:07;00:13;"Hyden to talk about his new book, about Bruce Springsteen and the Born in the USA album."
00:13;00:21;"Speaking of America, when you order a burrito, what do you expect to get on the side?"
00:23;00:31;"Think about that and listen to Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:17;01:23;"Time Crisis back again. Breaking news, the boys just ordered Mexican food. Jake, what'd you get?"
01:23;01:28;"A chicken burrito, no lettuce. Chicken burrito, no lettuce. Seinfeld, meanwhile,"
01:28;01:35;"ordered a large chicken burrito, which is just stuffed to the gills with rice."
01:35;01:39;"Okay, I didn't know that going in. This burrito's stuffed to the gills with rice,"
01:39;01:44;"and it comes with a side of tortilla chips, but additionally, you ordered a side of fries."
01:44;01:48;"Yeah. And I just got to say, there's something about ordering a side of fries with a burrito"
01:48;01:52;"that's so twisted. I love it, and I'm the beneficiary. I'm housing those fries."
01:52;01:58;"Here's the thing. I like fries, and what I'll say is that when I saw the burrito on the menu,"
01:58;02:02;"first of all, it wasn't explicit that it came with chips. This was through DoorDash. We didn't"
02:02;02:07;"order, I mean, I was sent the menu through DoorDash. Also, the amount of rice in the burrito,"
02:07;02:13;"also not clear to me. This is not a place I order from regularly, and I see fries. I like fries."
02:14;02:17;"If I see them on the menu, I'm going to get the fries. I was hungry."
02:17;02:23;"All right, I got an idea. It's called Casa de Seinfeld."
02:23;02:23;"Oh, boy."
02:23;02:28;"It's a Mexican restaurant, except we got a guarantee. Zero tortilla chips, only fries."
02:28;02:31;"It's an American fusion."
02:31;02:34;"Fries and salsa. No ketchup available."
02:34;02:38;"Yeah, there was no ketchup, by the way. No ketchup, no cutlery, no napkins."
02:38;02:40;"And when you're eating a burrito, you don't really need napkins, right?"
02:41;02:46;"Well, burritos frequently have structural problems, so yeah, you need a napkin."
02:46;02:46;"Deeply sarcastic."
02:46;02:50;"What if we opened two places across the street from each other? One place is a burger place"
02:50;02:55;"that has no fries, only tortilla chips, and then across the street is a taco and burrito place"
02:55;02:56;"that only has fries."
02:56;03:00;"I think there's a cycle being created. I like it. Also, let me just point out,"
03:00;03:03;"they were house-cut fries. They weren't just regular fries."
03:03;03:04;"That's a problem."
03:04;03:05;"Cut in-house."
03:05;03:05;"House-cut."
03:05;03:10;"They're good. I mean, they're kind of just like nice, thick pieces of potato."
03:11;03:12;"They're not that fries-y."
03:12;03:16;"No, they were a little soggy. Fries don't travel well, as I think we've documented on this show"
03:16;03:20;"before. They were fine. They were fine. I would have liked ketchup. I don't want to dip fries in"
03:20;03:22;"salsa, necessarily, but here we are."
03:22;03:26;"I'm an all-American guy. I eat fries with my burrito. You know what I mean?"
03:26;03:34;"It's just, I don't know why. Something about that really gets me."
03:34;03:39;"And also just being at a very traditional Mexican place and everybody's just going around"
03:39;03:41;"ordering and you're just like, ""And do you have fries?"""
03:41;03:46;"I mean, how often does a Mexican place have fries?"
03:46;03:47;"I think it's a standard thing."
03:47;03:47;"I think you canâ€”"
03:47;03:48;"Standard?"
03:48;03:51;"Because a lot of times you can go to a Mexican restaurant and order a burger."
03:51;03:52;"Hamburguesa."
03:52;03:53;"See?"
03:53;03:55;"Yeah, hamburguesa."
03:55;03:55;"See?"
03:55;03:58;"So, yeah. I mean, that's frequently on the menu."
03:58;04:04;"I feel like fries are like 6 out of 10 Mexican restaurants. You're going to have a fry option."
04:04;04:04;"Yeah."
04:04;04:05;"Six or seven."
04:05;04:07;"I like that. I would push it to seven."
04:07;04:08;"Seven."
04:08;04:11;"If I worked there, I'd be like, ""You have a big order here. I just want to be clear that"
04:11;04:15;"the fries are meant to go with the hamburguesa, not the burrito."""
04:15;04:17;"Did you guys see hamburguesa on that menu?"
04:17;04:18;"I didn't. Maybe I didn't do it."
04:18;04:20;"I didn't scroll down that far. It's also the end of the menu."
04:20;04:23;"So this place had no hamburguesa, only fries."
04:23;04:29;"See? Now I'm feeling crazy. I want to actually look back at the menu and see what I missed."
04:29;04:35;"No, I mean, look, again, this is America. It's a land of different cultures coming together."
04:35;04:40;"Oh, you know what? I lied. It does say in very small print, ""Serve with chips,"" first of all."
04:40;04:43;"But you know, when you're hungry, you're not really reading the fine print."
04:43;04:47;"Had I seen that, maybe I'm not getting the fries, but they are house cut."
04:47;04:49;"Burritos and fries."
04:51;04:57;"You may be sweet and nice"
04:57;05:03;"But that won't keep you warm at night"
05:03;05:09;"'Cause I'm the one who showed you how"
05:09;05:15;"To do the things you're doing now"
05:15;05:21;"He may feel all your charms"
05:21;05:27;"He may hold you in his arms"
05:27;05:33;"But I'm the one who let you in"
05:33;05:41;"I was right beside you then"
05:41;05:44;"Have you guys ever ordered a shawarma?"
05:44;05:45;"Yeah."
05:45;05:46;"Where they put the fries in the shawarma."
05:46;05:47;"Oh yeah, I love that. I love that."
05:47;05:50;"Okay. What is a shawarma but not a Middle Eastern burrito?"
05:50;05:53;"At the end of the day. It's the same thing."
05:53;05:56;"It's just not done, Seinfeld. It's just not done."
05:56;05:59;"It's the same thing. It's the same food product."
05:59;06:03;"I think for whatever reason, it would be more normal, actually, if the fries were in the burrito."
06:03;06:06;"There's something about just, like, housing a burrito plus fries."
06:06;06:11;"It's just the sense and memory of eating thousands of burritos in my life and having crunchy chips next to it."
06:11;06:15;"There's something about having these soggy house-cut fries next to the burrito."
06:15;06:17;"It just feels off."
06:17;06:20;"Listen, NGL, not gonna lie. I was very, very hungry."
06:20;06:25;"And you know that thing when you go to a restaurant and you're like, ""Oh, I could just eat everything on this menu."""
06:25;06:27;"Yeah, yeah. There was a little bit of that spirit."
06:27;06:30;"This is the Seinfeld bit. ""We're eating!"""
06:30;06:31;"You're hungry as a horse."
06:31;06:34;"More everything, yeah. Hungry as a horse."
06:34;06:36;"Couldn't, you know, one of the fries, one of the burrito."
06:36;06:38;"I think we've covered it."
06:38;06:42;"Got 'em both. Friend of the show, Steve Heiden, is on today."
06:42;06:44;"And he's gonna talk about..."
06:44;06:48;"We have to ask Steven about his opinion on the cover of Get a Grip."
06:48;06:49;"Oh, yeah."
06:49;06:50;"We're open with that."
06:50;06:55;"After our wildly successful Aerosmith episode last time."
06:55;06:56;"Let's get him on."
06:56;07:01;"Let's get right into it. Steven Heiden's got a new book about Bruce Springsteen, and he's gonna be our guest."
07:01;07:08;"And I think this episode is gonna be mostly dedicated to the all-American icon Bruce Springsteen and his album Bored in the USA."
07:08;07:15;"Which came out on June 4th, 1984, and we are taping on June 4th, 2024."
07:15;07:20;"Wow. I was two months old when that came out. Now I'm 40."
07:20;07:23;"I'm the exact same age as Born in the USA, basically."
07:23;07:25;"That's deep."
07:25;07:28;"And what could be more American than a burrito with fries?"
07:28;07:32;"Now that's a dish that was born in the USA."
07:32;07:35;"Alright, let's get him on the phone and talk about his new book."
07:35;07:41;"There Was Nothing You Could Do, Colin. Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA and the End of the Heartland."
07:41;07:45;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
07:45;07:52;"I'm bumping this record in the car for Lizzie the last three mornings."
07:52;07:53;"Born in the USA?"
07:53;07:56;"Yeah. I've been listening to this audiobook. I've just been in the zone."
07:56;07:57;"What does she think?"
07:57;07:59;"She really likes I'm on Fire."
07:59;08:01;"The openness, the space."
08:01;08:02;"She's got a taste."
08:02;08:06;"Yeah, the sparse-ness of it."
08:06;08:10;"I mean, what did she think about just track one?"
08:10;08:14;"I mean, I was sort of like, ""Lizzie, keyboard."""
08:14;08:16;"And she was kind of blank stare."
08:16;08:18;"Wasn't getting much."
08:18;08:21;"You know, as we wait for Steven, perfect timing."
08:21;08:27;"With the 40th anniversary, they just dropped a new Bruce live album, Born in the USA, tour '84 to '85."
08:27;08:28;"Oh, wow."
08:28;08:34;"I was listening to this Born in the USA live at Giant Stadium, August 22nd, 1985."
08:34;08:40;"And I mean, the album version is raucous enough, but hearing this live version, I've been struck."
08:40;08:43;"But this is just such an insane song."
08:43;08:44;"Yeah."
08:44;08:48;"Just like, so balls to the wall."
08:52;08:53;"Did they open the show with it?"
08:53;08:54;"I think so."
08:54;08:56;"One, two, three, four!"
09:02;09:04;"I mean, this is just crazy music."
09:09;09:10;"Can you hear this, Steven?"
09:10;09:11;"I can."
09:11;09:14;"We're listening to that live album they just dropped."
09:14;09:15;"Right."
09:15;09:16;"I saw that."
09:18;09:20;"August of '85."
09:22;09:25;"I think those whole shows are on Nuggets."
09:25;09:26;"Oh, really?"
09:26;09:28;"Or Nuggets. Yeah."
11:14;11:16;"I'm struck by how raucous that song is."
11:16;11:17;"Yeah."
11:17;11:20;"It's just so intense. The synths are so loud."
11:20;11:21;"[whistles]"
11:21;11:22;"Right."
11:22;11:23;"That's just crazy music."
11:23;11:24;"It's pretty singular."
11:24;11:25;"Yeah."
11:25;11:27;"On that album and its catalog."
11:27;11:31;"Yeah, and on the album especially. I think it hits so hard."
11:31;11:32;"Yeah."
11:32;11:34;"It's such an amazing entry point."
11:34;11:39;"And they're playing live in the studio on the album track, so that's basically live."
11:39;11:46;"They're not in front of 50,000 people, but it is an entrance into an album."
11:46;11:47;"Yeah."
11:47;11:49;"They're not messing around with that."
11:49;11:53;"And I guess that synth line, is that just mimicking the vocal line?"
11:53;11:56;"[sings]"
11:56;11:57;"Yeah."
11:57;11:59;"Who's the synth player again? Is it Roy?"
11:59;12:01;"It's Professor Roy Bitt."
12:01;12:03;"The same guy who plays all the iconic piano parts."
12:03;12:09;"I wonder if he was like, ""Is this too dumb if I just mimic what you're singing?"""
12:09;12:11;"[sings]"
12:11;12:16;"Well, it's my understanding that they didn't really have an arrangement for the song."
12:16;12:20;"Bruce just showed them the chords and then they just played it."
12:20;12:25;"So I don't think there was a lot of premeditation with the different parts."
12:25;12:26;"They just--"
12:26;12:27;"Right."
12:27;12:29;"Bruce was like, ""Here's the song. Let's go."""
12:29;12:32;"And they were such a good band."
12:32;12:37;"They've been touring for so long that it just worked."
12:37;12:43;"The thing with Born in the USA that I think is really interesting is that it's looked at as this slick pop record,"
12:43;12:47;"which it is in a lot of ways, but those tracks came together pretty quickly."
12:47;12:51;"And they weren't really messing around with a lot of different takes."
12:51;12:56;"It was like, ""Let's play it live. Play it live a few times and we're good to go."""
12:56;12:59;"And it's also funny. I mean, this is a larger conversation."
12:59;13:01;"We've had a little bit on this show too."
13:01;13:07;"As Jake has often said, he believes the 1970s is the peak of recorded music"
13:07;13:12;"because it's all the innovations of the '50s and '60s."
13:12;13:19;"And it is kind of the pinnacle of analog recording where they had it so dialed in on recording to tape."
13:19;13:23;"And it's before the introduction of some of the things that make '80s music exciting,"
13:23;13:26;"drum machines and synths and digital tape."
13:26;13:30;"The '70s was the high point of a certain type of recording technology."
13:30;13:35;"And as much as people in a broad sense have sometimes referred to--"
13:35;13:40;"This is maybe in the '90s, like the haters being like, ""Oh, the '80s were so slick. It lacked life."""
13:40;13:42;"And I've always felt like there's something funny about it"
13:42;13:48;"because a lot of classic '80s recordings have almost like a lo-fi quality compared to the '70s."
13:48;13:55;"I don't think it would be crazy to say that ""Born to Run"" is in a sense more slick sounding than ""Born in the USA."""
13:55;14:00;"Because ""Born to Run"" is a perfect mid-'70s, beautifully produced album."
14:00;14:04;"By 1975, they knew exactly how to mic and record a piano."
14:04;14:07;"And they spent the time to arrange it as well."
14:07;14:08;"Yeah."
14:08;14:09;"It's much more sophisticated."
14:10;14:16;"In the day we sweated out on the streets of a runaway American dream"
14:16;14:23;"At night we racked up mansions of glory and suicide machines"
14:23;14:26;"Sprung from cages on Highway 9"
14:26;14:31;"Torn wheel, fume injected and stepping out over the line"
14:31;14:36;"Oh, baby, this town rips the bones from your back"
14:36;14:39;"It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap"
14:39;14:42;"We gotta get up while we're young"
14:42;14:48;"'Cause trance like us, baby, we were born to run"
14:48;14:58;"And then you get into the '80s where people are using new technology and it's like..."
14:58;15:01;"I don't know. It's like the gated snare."
15:01;15:03;"To me, this is like..."
15:04;15:06;"crazier sounding..."
15:06;15:07;"It's raw."
15:07;15:08;"Yeah, this is not slick."
15:08;15:18;"Born down in a dead man's town"
15:18;15:22;"The first kick I took was my hit-and-run"
15:22;15:25;"Ended up like a dog that's been beat too much"
15:25;15:30;"'Til you spent half your life just to cover him up now"
15:31;15:34;"Born in the U.S.A."
15:34;15:38;"I was born in the U.S.A."
15:42;15:46;"Born in the U.S.A. now"
15:46;15:49;"Anyway, I think that's roughly true of a lot of '80s stuff."
15:49;15:50;"Like, we've talked on the show, too."
15:50;15:52;"A lot of classic Prince..."
15:52;15:53;"Right."
15:53;15:54;"It's like lo-fi..."
15:54;15:55;"Mm-hmm."
15:55;15:56;"In a way."
15:56;15:57;"Right."
15:57;15:58;"You know what I mean?"
15:58;15:59;"Like, the '80s..."
15:59;16:01;"I'm talking about the '80s being slick."
16:01;16:02;"It's synth-y."
16:02;16:03;"Right."
16:03;16:06;"Yeah, I think it's an idea of slickness"
16:06;16:09;"rather than the actual execution of the music."
16:09;16:10;"Yes."
16:10;16:11;"I think with Bruce in this time,"
16:11;16:14;"it's really hard to separate him"
16:14;16:17;"from the music videos that he made"
16:17;16:20;"and just the way he was perceived and packaged."
16:20;16:25;"I think that adds to people's perception of the music."
16:25;16:27;"But going along with what you were saying,"
16:27;16:29;"what I think is so interesting about this record--"
16:29;16:31;"and this isn't a unique observation--"
16:31;16:33;"but the story of Born in the U.S.A."
16:33;16:35;"is intertwined with Nebraska."
16:35;16:36;"Mm-hmm."
16:36;16:38;"And there was an overlap"
16:38;16:42;"in when Bruce was recording these songs"
16:42;16:47;"because the bulk of the album was made in early '82."
16:47;16:51;"And that was around the time when Bruce was"
16:51;16:53;"trying to figure out what he was going to do"
16:53;16:54;"with these Nebraska songs."
16:54;16:58;"So there is a period where he is thinking about Nebraska"
16:58;17:00;"and Born in the U.S.A. at the same time."
17:00;17:07;"And there's a synth part that he recorded for Nebraska."
17:07;17:09;"And I should look this up quickly."
17:09;17:10;"You can edit this."
17:10;17:12;"But I think it's in ""State Trooper."""
17:12;17:13;"Hmm."
17:13;17:15;"I'm trying to remember what song that is."
17:15;17:18;"But there's a song that he lays down a synth part for"
17:18;17:20;"in Nebraska, and he did that"
17:20;17:22;"while he was working on Born in the U.S.A."
17:22;17:27;"Nebraska is a record that we all think of as being lo-fi."
17:27;17:29;"But there's also some interesting production things"
17:29;17:30;"going on there, too."
17:30;17:31;"Mm."
17:31;17:34;"In the book, I make the case that that record"
17:34;17:37;"is more like a post-punk record than a folk record"
17:37;17:39;"because it's more about the murkiness"
17:39;17:42;"and kind of being anti-technology with that record"
17:42;17:46;"than a folk record, which typically is about clarity"
17:46;17:50;"of the vocal and the guitar and putting the lyrics up"
17:50;17:52;"above everything else."
17:52;17:55;"And with Nebraska, there's a lot of things you can't hear"
17:55;17:58;"or that you think you hear that aren't quite there."
17:58;18:01;"So yeah, I think how you talk about both of those records,"
18:01;18:05;"it goes deeper than just the common perception"
18:05;18:08;"or conversation is about those records."
18:08;18:09;"Mm."
18:09;18:12;"Right, yeah, because they're famously contrasting"
18:12;18:13;"with each other."
18:13;18:15;"Yeah, lo-fi versus slick."
18:15;18:16;"But yeah, that's a great point."
18:16;18:18;"But actually, they're both lo-fi records."
18:18;18:20;"Yeah, in a way."

18:58;19:02;"Please don't stop me"
19:10;19:20;"[Instrumental]"
19:20;19:24;"Maybe you've got a kid"
19:24;19:28;"Maybe you've got a pretty wife"
19:28;19:32;"The only thing that I've got"
19:32;19:36;"Been bothering me my whole life"
19:36;19:40;"Mr. State Trooper"
19:40;19:44;"Please don't stop me"
19:52;20:04;"Certainly, like, again, like, you're talking about Born to Run. I mean, that's a record that is much more produced in terms of, you know, going for like a Phil Spector
type aesthetic."
20:04;20:12;"Certainly, like, the song Born to Run is like just this grand production with all these different parts and things going on."
20:12;20:18;"And Born in the USA is like, again, largely recorded live, and it's like pretty spare."
20:18;20:27;"Like, there's not like a ton of instruments going on a lot of those songs. I mean, like Clarence Clemens is not on the record very much."
20:27;20:35;"It's like a pretty like lean rhythm guitar, like the synth, the drums are like very simple, but like powerful."
20:35;20:41;"It's all pretty like clean and stripped down and straightforward, but it sounds huge."
20:41;20:53;"For the listeners, tell us like the origin of this book, why you wanted to zoom in on this album and this moment in particular, like what kind of kickstarted it?"
20:53;21:02;"Well, there was a personal reason and like a broader reason. The personal reason was that this is one of the first records I ever loved."
21:02;21:07;"At the beginning of the book, I write about how I heard this album when I was six years old."
21:07;21:12;"That's how old I was in the summer of '84 when this record dropped."
21:12;21:19;"So it's really like one of those works of art that has been with me pretty much as long as anything."
21:19;21:23;"So that was interesting to me. So that's the personal reason."
21:23;21:31;"And then the broader reason was I just felt like this is a record that I think just the record itself, it's a great record."
21:31;21:42;"It has a really interesting backstory. I think in Bruce's career, it feels like the pivotal record in terms of like him building up to a moment like that in the first
decade of his professional life."
21:42;21:53;"And then afterward reacting in various ways to the phenomenon that he went through and the fame and the iconic status that it gave him."
21:53;21:58;"This sort of macho image that he's talked about rebelling against in a lot of ways."
21:58;22:02;"And then the larger kind of cultural and political things."
22:02;22:11;"Like when I wrote my Kid A book, I felt like talking about Kid A was a way to talk about the internet and technology and the beginning of a new century."
22:11;22:19;"And I kind of felt like with this album, it was like a way to talk about how the country's changed in the last 40 years, like how music has changed in the last 40 years."
22:19;22:25;"It's like a rich text. There's like a lot of different directions that you can go in when talking about this record."
22:25;22:35;"Yeah, it's a political record, but he's taking that sort of detached observer stance. There isn't like a strident political message."
22:35;22:41;"Yeah, and it's like, it's interesting because it's not as political as people believe it is."
22:41;22:42;"Right."
22:42;22:48;"It is political because of Born in the USA. And then you have My Hometown as the bookend track."
22:48;22:56;"And it's funny like how albums are put together, how a track list or a sequence can really affect how people look at the album."
22:56;23:05;"Because like this was a record, Bruce wrote a lot of songs for this record. There were a lot of different track lists, trying to figure out what songs would go on."
23:05;23:14;"And at some point, Chuck Plotkin, who's like one of the co-producers, like he suggested you got to put Born in the USA at the beginning and My Hometown at the end."
23:14;23:24;"And with those songs as bookends, the record will feel like it's cohesive, even though you've got a lot of songs on the record that like aren't political at all."
23:24;23:33;"Like I'm On Fire is not political or I'm Dancing in the Dark. Not really. I mean, it's a pretty personal song, but not really political."
23:33;23:43;"But it feels that way. And I think that in combination with how the band sounds, I think the band is the through line of that record."
23:43;23:52;"Like how they play with Bruce, the feeling of community that that band brought to his music, which I think is really important."
23:52;23:59;"And it's interesting because it's like really like the last gasp of that classic era of the band."
23:59;24:05;"Because once you get to Tunnel of Love, he's like working by himself, largely in the studio."
24:05;24:12;"And then of course, the band breaks up in '88. So yeah, it's like a last hurrah for them."
24:12;24:17;"But it's also like in a lot of ways, like maybe their greatest moment on record with Bruce."
24:17;24:22;"So, yeah, all those things, I think, feed into what makes the record interesting to me."
24:22;24:30;"I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand"
24:30;24:38;"To the bus stop to pick up a paper from my old man"
24:38;24:46;"He said on his lap in that big old Buick, the steers we drove through town"
24:46;24:54;"Tassel my hair, say something, good luck around"
24:54;24:58;"This is your hometown"
24:58;25:03;"This is your hometown"
25:03;25:07;"This is your hometown"
25:07;25:10;"This is your hometown"
25:10;25:18;"Can we talk a little bit about, because I'm not sure I totally know the answer, like, where was Bruce career-wise just before this album?"
25:18;25:24;"I think there's something about, because Nebraska is this like strange left turn."
25:24;25:31;"Sometimes I think, oh, right, he was like really due for a comeback. But The River was like a huge album."
25:31;25:37;"I mean, so was he still seen as being kind of like a 70s guy in '84?"
25:37;25:43;"What was going on in the year leading up to this in terms of Bruce's status and how he saw himself?"
25:43;25:48;"Yeah, I mean, you're right. He was this big star already."
25:48;25:55;"Certainly, as a live performer, I think you could make the case that he was probably a bigger concert draw than he was"
25:55;25:59;"in terms of selling records or certainly having hit songs."
25:59;26:05;"One thing I talk about in the book is that Bruce, he talked about this in the mid-80s,"
26:05;26:11;"but he's talked about this throughout his entire career, this idea of music being a unifier of people,"
26:11;26:16;"that you can put out a hit song and people hear it and they have a connection to it."
26:16;26:21;"That kind of music, it really matters. Like music for the people is a term that he's used."
26:21;26:26;"And Bruce, in a lot of ways, wasn't necessarily doing that."
26:26;26:32;"He wasn't like a Tom Petty or Bob Seger. Those guys had pop hits."
26:32;26:37;"Bruce largely didn't do that. He had ""Born to Run,"" that was a radio song."
26:37;26:41;"He had ""Hungry Heart"" from The River, which was a top five song."
26:41;26:47;"But he was like an album guy. ""Darkness on the Edge of Town"" doesn't really have any hits on it."
26:47;26:55;"Couldn't really look at that album. I guess ""Badlands"" you could maybe say is a hit, but it's not really a pop song."
26:55;26:59;"And meanwhile, he's writing songs like ""Because the Night"" and ""Fire."""
26:59;27:03;"""Because the Night"" goes to Patti Smith, ""Fire"" goes to the Pointer Sisters."
27:03;27:09;"These songs that do become hits for other people, but he's consciously giving those songs away."
27:09;27:15;"So there is this sort of mixed emotion that he has, I think, about engaging pop music."
27:15;27:27;"So that leads to ""Born in the USA,"" which I think there was an idea in the business that this was going to be the record that put him on that super, superstar level."
27:27;27:37;"And ""Thriller"" comes out, and that shows how a record like that can be rolled out over several months, where you just have single after single."
27:37;27:47;"I think there's seven singles from ""Thriller."" I know there's seven from ""Born in the USA,"" but I think there's seven singles from ""Thriller."""
27:47;27:54;"Just this idea that you can keep putting out singles and having hits, keeping an album around for two years."
27:54;28:01;"""Thriller"" helps to set that template, and then ""Born in the USA"" really capitalizes on that."
28:01;28:10;"But yeah, I think he was a big star on the verge of becoming a really big star, but also feeling ambivalence about it."
28:10;28:17;"And that's how you get ""Nebraska,"" that's how you get ""Tunnel of Love"" coming after ""Born in the USA."""
28:17;28:27;"Bruce has always been kind of ambivalent about ""Born in the USA"" generally, just the comments he's made in his book or elsewhere."
28:27;28:37;"He doesn't really think it's his best record. I think he's had misgivings about going as pop as he did with that record."
28:37;28:43;"So that's another interesting wrinkle with his album, that he fully embraced it."
28:43;28:50;"I was really surprised by that in the book, how ambivalent he was about the whole project that he's saying."
28:50;28:59;"It was interesting how John Landau basically browbeat him into doing ""Dancing in the Dark,"" and that was the last song they recorded."
28:59;29:07;"And I was just like, ""Wow, this is such an interesting portrait of an artist working with having a good synergy with his management,"""
29:07;29:15;"where the management is really challenging the artist in a way that's actually creatively productive."
29:15;29:18;"Because I think ""Dancing in the Dark"" â€” that's one of the great Bruce songs."
29:18;29:27;"It's weird to think that, I don't know, if he had a different relationship with Landau or a different manager, that song wouldn't exist."
29:27;29:34;"And it's so strange because the album is such a big swing, and it's such an extroverted record,"
29:34;29:38;"that he would make that record but also at the same time be doubting it."
29:38;29:43;"Because it's such a confident record with that cover, the first track."
29:43;29:46;"Everyone's just like, ""Wow, Bruce is going for it. He's all jacked."""
29:46;29:54;"But at the same time, he's like, ""I don't know about this."" I was really surprised by that in your book."
29:54;30:01;"He's a contemplative guy. If you read about him in many aspects of his life, but certainly creatively,"
30:01;30:08;"he's the type of guy who's going to write three or four songs for every one song that goes on the record."
30:08;30:13;"He's going to be ruminating about what kind of record to make."
30:13;30:17;"If you look at the records before this, there were other examples of him doing this."
30:17;30:21;"I don't know if you saw that documentary about ""Darkness on the Edge of Town,"""
30:21;30:28;"but a big thing with that record was that he wrote all of these songs that were more in the style of ""Born to Run."""
30:28;30:37;"Just great poppy, early '60s-type sounding rock songs. He didn't put any of those on the record."
30:37;30:44;"He instead makes ""Darkness,"" which is this very Spartan, downbeat, story-oriented album."
30:44;30:50;"We look at that record as being iconic now, but it's really different from ""Born to Run."""
30:50;30:55;"It's nothing really like that record in terms of the music."
30:55;31:02;"That's really the beginning of Bruce becoming the modern Bruce Springsteen that we all think of when we think of Bruce."
31:02;31:07;"That's where Bruce is literally writing a song called ""Factory"" on ""Darkness."""
31:07;31:16;"That's when he's writing about guys racing in the street and going home, and their girlfriend's there, and she's crying."
31:16;31:19;"Those types of stories. He wasn't really writing those."
31:19;31:30;"""Born to Run"" is more romantic, and it feels more maybe adolescent, where ""Darkness"" is grown-up."
31:30;31:35;"Grown-up people having real problems, trying to work through it."
31:35;31:40;"That becomes his theme from then on, the kind of song he's going to be writing."
31:41;31:47;"Early in the morning, factory whistle blows"
31:47;31:53;"Man rises from bed and puts on his clothes"
31:53;31:59;"Man takes his lunch, walks out in the morning light"
31:59;32:05;"It's the work, the work, and just the work in life"
32:05;32:11;"Through the mansions of fear, through the mansions of pain"
32:11;32:17;"See my daddy walking through them factory gates in the rain"
32:17;32:23;"Factory takes his ear and factory gives him life"
32:23;32:28;"The work, the work, and just the work in life"
32:28;32:34;"Before then, you could see the first three albums, which I think are all excellent."
32:34;32:39;"But it's not hard to see Bruce through a hater's eyes in the first three records."
32:39;32:46;"They might be like, ""Alright, what are 'Born to Run'?"" It's a good song, but they might have thought he was a bit corny or something."
32:46;32:49;"Even if he had exhibited craft."
32:49;32:54;"I think there's intense dark moments, of course, on ""Born to Run,"" but you could still see it through a hater's eyes."
32:54;32:59;"Until ""Darkness,"" they might still just like..."
32:59;33:02;"They see him as a smiling, high-energy dude."
33:02;33:08;"He hasn't really made an album yet that broadens the Bruce world."
33:08;33:13;"Right. There's this story about Todd Rundgren, who is a famous hater."
33:13;33:18;"He was asked to produce ""Bat Out of Hell,"" the Meatloaf record."
33:18;33:24;"He agreed to do it because he thought it was intended to be a parody of ""Born to Run."""
33:24;33:27;"That's how he viewed that record."
33:27;33:31;"If you listen to it that way, it does make sense."
33:31;33:35;"That Meatloaf record, which I'm a fan of, I enjoy that record."
33:35;33:37;"But it's a very grandiose record."
33:37;33:45;"It takes a lot of those piano-based, epic songs on ""Born to Run"" and just exaggerates it."
33:45;33:47;"Does Roy Bitton play on both albums?"
33:47;33:49;"Yeah, I think Weinberg does too."
33:49;33:52;"Right, so there's some shared person. I wonder if Bruce felt that way at all."
33:52;33:59;"He was kind of like, ""Uh, guys, you're backing up a dude called Meatloaf?"""
33:59;34:02;"Doing kind of like E Street stuff? I don't know."
34:02;34:07;"â™ª Well, I remember every little thing as if it happened only yesterday â™ª"
34:07;34:12;"â™ª Walking by the lake and there was not another car in sight â™ª"
34:12;34:18;"â™ª And I never had a girl looking any better than you did â™ª"
34:18;34:23;"â™ª And all the kids at school, they were wishing they were me that night â™ª"
34:23;34:28;"â™ª And now our bodies are holding so close and tight â™ª"
34:28;34:33;"â™ª It never felt so good, it never felt so right â™ª"
34:33;34:37;"â™ª And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife â™ª"
34:37;34:40;"â™ª Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife â™ª"
34:40;34:42;"â™ª Come on, hold on tight â™ª"
34:42;34:45;"â™ª Well, come on, hold on tight â™ª"
34:45;34:49;"â™ª"
34:49;34:55;"â™ª Oh, it's cold and lonely in the deep, dark night â™ª"
34:55;35:02;"â™ª I can see paradise by the dance floor light â™ª"
35:02;35:06;"But that kind of shows, if Bruce didn't already feel that way,"
35:06;35:10;"that might have been a sign of, ""Okay, maybe I have to do something different now."""
35:10;35:17;"Because my style, it's reached the point now where people can do this exaggerated version of it."
35:17;35:20;"And maybe I'm going to become a parody of myself."
35:20;35:25;"You know, music was changing too, punk was coming in, it was a different type of vibe."
35:25;35:33;"And ""Darkness"" was definitely a better record for that type of rock scene, really, in the late '70s."
35:33;35:37;"And I've always gotten the impression that Bruce has his ear to the ground."
35:37;35:38;"Right."
35:38;35:40;"Maybe I've even asked you about this before."
35:40;35:43;"This is this thing I always look up and then I forget the answer."
35:43;35:49;"I remember hearing way back in the day that Nebraska was influenced by the '70s."
35:49;35:52;"And that Nebraska was influenced by suicide."
35:52;35:53;"Right."
35:53;35:54;"By the band Suicide."
35:54;36:00;"And then later on, in the 2000s, Bruce started covering ""Dream Baby Dream,"" the Suicide song."
36:00;36:06;"And I just never had a definitive answer, though, was in the mid to late '70s--"
36:06;36:10;"they would have been playing a lot of the same clubs, like Max's Kansas City or whatever."
36:10;36:16;"Was Bruce on record seeing Suicide, knowing those early records, being a fan?"
36:16;36:22;"And then with ""Darkness,"" would he have already been familiar with these really intense,"
36:22;36:27;"kind of beyond punk, like proto-punk avant-garde things like Suicide?"
36:27;36:29;"Did that come up in your research at all?"
36:29;36:32;"Yeah, I wrote about Suicide a bit in the book."
36:32;36:37;"And the first Suicide record was recorded at the same studio that Bruce originally worked at"
36:37;36:43;"in the early '70s, before Lando was like, ""We've got to go to the record plant."""
36:43;36:47;"So the song ""Born to Run"" was recorded at the same studio that Suicide worked in."
36:47;36:52;"And then Lando was like, ""Let's go to a real studio,"" you know, in Manhattan."
36:52;36:53;"Right."
36:53;36:55;"And the rest was history there."
36:55;37:00;"But I don't know exactly when he came into Suicide."
37:00;37:03;"I mean, I'm sure it was before Nebraska."
37:03;37:09;"He's talked about the song ""Frankie Teardrop"" in particular as being a song that he really loves."
37:09;37:13;"That song is kind of like a Bruce Springsteen song."
37:13;37:21;"Like, it's about this guy who loses his job, and he doesn't know what to do, and he's depressed."
37:21;37:25;"But in the Suicide song, the guy ends up killing his wife and kid."
37:25;37:27;"So that goes beyond--"
37:27;37:29;"Did Bruce ever go that dark?"
37:29;37:31;"Bruce never went that dark."
37:31;37:33;"And I mean, that song is so wild, too."
37:33;37:34;"I mean, just--"
37:34;37:39;"""Killed my wife and kid in Baltimore, Jack!"""
37:39;37:43;"I mean, it's like a 10-minute song, and like--"
37:43;37:46;"What year did this come out?"
37:46;37:48;"Is this the first record?"
37:48;37:50;"I think it's '77, I think."
37:50;37:52;"But it was recorded way earlier, I think."
37:52;37:53;"Right."
37:53;37:59;"Do you know, Stephen, with early Suicide, they were recording in '73, '74?"
37:59;38:00;"I don't know exactly."
38:00;38:01;"I'd have to look that up."
38:01;38:09;"I don't know if they were recording-- I think they were playing in New York, going back to '77."
38:09;38:17;"Adam Vega was actually quite older than the average punk musician at that time."
38:17;38:19;"But yeah, Frankie Kidro--"
38:19;38:22;"Does it scream in that song?"
38:22;38:25;"I think he kills his kid first."
38:25;38:30;"And it is the most unsettling thing."
38:30;38:31;"Yeah, like-- 'cause what's his name?"
38:31;38:33;"Alan Vega was always doing like--"
38:33;38:36;"Like, yeah, pretty Bruce-type, pretty Nebraska."
38:36;38:37;"Right."
38:37;38:41;"Yeah, and Alan Vega had an Elvis thing, just like Bruce did."
38:41;38:45;"I mean, Alan Vega was really into the '50s rockers."
38:45;38:50;"And it's like, Alan Vega and Bruce Springsteen definitely had some shared influences."
38:50;38:53;"It's just that they came at it from totally different angles."
38:53;38:59;"But Frankie can't make it"
38:59;39:05;"'Cause things are just too hard"
39:05;39:11;"Frankie can't make enough money"
39:11;39:17;"Frankie can't buy enough food"
39:17;39:22;"And Frankie's getting evicted"
39:22;39:31;"All I do for Frankie"
39:31;39:42;"Oh Frankie, Frankie"
39:42;39:45;"Oh Frankie, Frankie"
39:45;39:50;"I feel like there's some of the songs in Nebraska where he's using the acoustic in a really rhythmic way--"
39:50;39:51;"Right."
39:51;39:54;"--to really conjure that same feeling of that suicide song."
39:54;39:58;"Yeah, there's a quote from Alan Vega where he said when he heard the song ""Stay Trooper"""
39:58;40:01;"that he thought it was a suicide song that he forgot that he recorded."
40:01;40:06;"And that song is very suicide-like."
40:06;40:08;"Yeah, you can picture him singing it."
40:08;40:11;"Please don't stop me, please don't stop me"
40:11;40:14;"You know, another thing that I always think about--"
40:14;40:20;"'cause I know this loomed so large for all urbane people in the late '70s"
40:20;40:23;"and I can't remember if you've written about this, Stephen, but"
40:23;40:26;"1977, Eraserhead comes out."
40:26;40:27;"Right."
40:27;40:29;"How old would Bruce have been then?"
40:29;40:30;"27?"
40:30;40:31;"Late 20s."
40:31;40:36;"And there's no way that Bruce, as a guy spending a lot of time in Manhattan,"
40:36;40:41;"would not have seen Eraserhead at a midnight movie once or twice."
40:41;40:44;"And obviously Lynch is coming at things from a--"
40:44;40:46;"well, it is all interrelated."
40:46;40:50;"You know, David Lynch, a dude very interested in the American heartland."
40:50;40:53;"I don't think his dad worked in a factory like Bruce,"
40:53;40:56;"but he always talks about how he went to art school in Philadelphia"
40:56;40:59;"and he was just like the weird parts of Philly."
40:59;41:02;"These bombed-out industrial parts haunted him"
41:02;41:04;"and basically helped create his aesthetic."
41:04;41:07;"It's a whimsical, spooky, even also whimsical version,"
41:07;41:12;"but there's something about Eraserhead, even though it doesn't take place in the real world,"
41:12;41:19;"it has this kind of urban alienation, post-industrial thing."
41:19;41:23;"It weirdly feels connected to suicide and Bruce, like a wildly different take."
41:23;41:28;"And I could just totally picture Bruce working on darkness,"
41:28;41:30;"catching some Eraserheads."
41:30;41:31;"Right."
41:31;41:33;"Any crossover between David Lynch and Bruce?"
41:33;41:35;"I haven't heard that."
41:35;41:38;"One thing I read about in the book is Bruce and Paul Schrader."
41:38;41:39;"Oh, yeah!"
41:39;41:40;"Oh, right. Yes."
41:40;41:45;"Because Paul Schrader, he wrote a screenplay called Born in the USA"
41:45;41:47;"that he sent to Bruce."
41:47;41:50;"There was a brief moment maybe when Bruce was going to be an actor"
41:50;41:52;"and that he would have starred in this movie."
41:52;41:54;"And that's where Bruce got the title."
41:54;41:56;"That's where he got the title."
41:56;41:59;"It's a movie about this bar band in Cleveland"
41:59;42:01;"and there's two brothers who are in the band."
42:01;42:04;"And the movie actually did end up getting made several years later."
42:04;42:06;"It was called Light of Day,"
42:06;42:09;"which is named after another Bruce Springsteen song."
42:09;42:13;"And basically gave Paul Schrader this song as penance"
42:13;42:15;"for taking the title of a screenplay."
42:15;42:20;"But that's a movie with Michael J. Fox and Joan Jett in it."
42:20;42:23;"Not a great movie. It's kind of an interesting movie."
42:23;42:27;"Like a very mulleted Michael J. Fox playing guitar"
42:27;42:29;"and then Joan Jett is his sister."
42:29;42:31;"I don't know who would have been the Springsteen role."
42:31;42:33;"I guess probably Michael J. Fox."
42:33;42:35;"Because it was originally two brothers"
42:35;42:38;"and then he changed it to a brother and a sister."
42:38;42:40;"I think it's interesting the connection."
42:40;42:43;"I talk about Taxi Driver in the book."
42:43;42:45;"That's also '77, right?"
42:45;42:47;"That's '76."
42:47;42:49;"That came out, yeah."
42:49;42:53;"Just the idea that movie is about a Vietnam veteran"
42:53;42:56;"who snaps, essentially."
42:56;43:00;"And Paul Schrader was part of that being a genre of film."
43:00;43:03;"That was something that other movies were made about."
43:03;43:07;"These Vietnam veterans coming home as ticking time bombs."
43:07;43:10;"Rambo is probably the most famous example of that."
43:10;43:11;"Great film."
43:11;43:15;"But it was also very famous as well with that."
43:15;43:17;"There's a story about..."
43:17;43:19;"It's unclear whether this is true,"
43:19;43:24;"but it's been suggested that the You Talking to Me improv"
43:24;43:28;"in Taxi Driver was taken from some stage banter"
43:28;43:30;"that Bruce Springsteen had"
43:30;43:33;"when Stacey and De Niro saw him at the bottom line"
43:33;43:36;"in New York in '75."
43:36;43:39;"De Niro has thrown that out as a possibility."
43:39;43:42;"Springsteen's like, ""I don't think that's true."""
43:42;43:45;"So it's unclear, but it's an interesting connection."
43:45;43:49;"But just this idea of a solitary man in a room,"
43:49;43:52;"lost in his thoughts,"
43:52;43:55;"just alienated from society."
43:55;43:58;"I think that was something that connected with Bruce"
43:58;44:00;"in his writing at that time."
44:00;44:03;"I think it speaks to what was going on in America"
44:03;44:05;"at that moment in time as well."
44:05;44:07;"But the David Lynch thing is interesting."
44:07;44:09;"I'm sure he saw Eraserhead."
44:09;44:11;"Bruce is a big cinephile."
44:11;44:14;"Movies are a big influence on what he does,"
44:14;44:17;"and his lyrics are very cinematic."
44:17;44:20;"I think he's the best of that kind of songwriting,"
44:20;44:22;"like a storytelling type songwriting,"
44:22;44:24;"where you see the song in your head."
44:24;44:26;"That type of lyric writing,"
44:26;44:29;"I think Bruce does probably better than anybody."
44:29;44:31;"Right, and of course in Nebraska,"
44:31;44:35;"there's the songs that are like the Terrence Malick movie."
44:35;44:37;"Oh, right."
44:37;44:40;"And then the one about, ""My name is Joe Roberts."""
44:40;44:43;"I think Sean Penn made a movie of that song."
44:43;44:44;"Is that right?"
44:44;44:46;"Yeah, The Indian Runner."
44:46;44:48;"That came out in '91."
44:48;44:50;"It's a pretty good movie, actually."
44:50;44:51;"Great story."
44:51;44:54;"Yeah, but Bruce is..."
44:54;44:57;"He's talked about Badlands being an influence on Nebraska."
44:57;44:59;"There's another movie called True Confessions"
44:59;45:03;"that no one remembers, but it came out in '81."
45:03;45:06;"He's like a big John Ford guy."
45:06;45:09;"The 1956 movie The Searchers,"
45:09;45:12;"which all those new Hollywood directors always talk about."
45:12;45:15;"Paul Schrader loves that movie, too."
45:15;45:18;"That was an influence on Taxi Driver."
45:18;45:21;"So yeah, I definitely think Bruce and Schrader"
45:21;45:23;"definitely have a connection."
45:23;45:25;"I could see Bruce being into Lynch"
45:25;45:28;"because Lynch also has that '50s, '60s thing."
45:28;45:29;"Yeah."
45:29;45:31;"That Bruce has always been interested in."
45:31;45:33;"Like that version of America."
45:33;45:37;"Lynch is fascinated with that, and so is Bruce."
45:37;45:39;"But again, they're coming at it from"
45:39;45:43;"two very different points of view or artistic approaches."
45:43;45:47;"My name is Joe Roberts"
45:47;45:51;"I work for the state"
45:51;45:56;"I'm a sergeant out of Burbank"
45:56;46:01;"Barracks number 8"
46:01;46:05;"I always done an honest job"
46:05;46:10;"As honest as I could"
46:10;46:13;"I got a brother named Frankie"
46:13;46:19;"Frankie ain't no good"
46:19;46:23;"Now ever since we was young kids"
46:23;46:28;"It's been the same come down"
46:28;46:32;"I get a call on the short way"
46:32;46:37;"Frankie's in trouble downtown"
46:37;46:41;"Well if it was any other man"
46:41;46:47;"I'd put him straight away"
46:47;46:49;"But when it's your brother"
46:49;46:55;"Sometimes you look the other way"
46:55;46:59;"Yeah me and Frankie laughing and drinking"
46:59;47:04;"Nothing feels better than blood on blood"
47:04;47:08;"Taking turns dancing with Marie"
47:08;47:14;"As a band played night at the Johnstown flood"
47:14;47:19;"I'd catch him when he's street"
47:19;47:24;"Like any brother would"
47:24;47:27;"Man turns his back on his family"
47:27;47:31;"Well he just ain't no good"
47:31;47:34;"We know that they at least know one person in common."
47:34;47:37;"Peter Wolfe from J. Giles Band."
47:37;47:39;"Lynch knows Peter Wolfe?"
47:39;47:41;"Peter Wolfe and Lynch were roommates."
47:41;47:43;"What?"
47:43;47:46;"Yeah there's some story that they were roommates in Boston."
47:46;47:48;"Maybe they were in school or something."
47:48;47:51;"And they went to a Bob Dylan concert together."
47:51;47:53;"And that Lynch wasn't feeling it."
47:53;47:55;"And he left."
47:55;47:57;"And I think Lynch tells the story in the documentary."
47:57;47:59;"And he says, and then like Peter Wolfe said to me"
47:59;48:01;"No one walks out on Dylan man."
48:01;48:05;"And I said, I walk out on Dylan."
48:05;48:09;"And then Peter Wolfe and Bruce, they were buddies from the New York."
48:09;48:11;"East Coast rock scene."
48:11;48:14;"We've talked on the show a bit about like listening to some J. Giles."
48:14;48:16;"And being like, well actually we talked a lot."
48:16;48:18;"Actually this is, now this is perfect."
48:18;48:20;"It's too bad I can never remember."
48:20;48:22;"Because when we do this show every two weeks."
48:22;48:24;"So just enough time to forget every episode."
48:24;48:26;"Which in some ways is a good thing."
48:26;48:30;"But I vaguely remember that we talked about once on the show."
48:30;48:33;"The fact that early 80s J. Giles Band."
48:33;48:35;"Like centerfold and stuff."
48:35;48:40;"Seems like the most obvious precedent for the sound of Born in the USA."
48:40;48:43;"And then we looked it up and we're like, yeah of course they knew each other from playing."
48:43;48:45;"No but, and centerfold was like early."
48:45;48:48;"Centerfold is like 80, 81?"
48:48;48:50;"Yeah, it's definitely, it's before Born."
48:50;48:52;"It predates Born by a lot, yeah."
48:52;48:54;"Yeah, definitely by a few years."
48:54;48:56;"What do you think about that theory?"
48:56;48:58;"Good call Ezra, I forgot about that."
48:58;48:59;"Right."
48:59;49:00;"No that totally makes sense."
49:00;49:04;"That's sort of like arena sounding bar band type thing."
49:04;49:05;"Where you have the synths."
49:05;49:06;"And very East Coast."
49:06;49:07;"Right."
49:07;49:09;"Catchy, catchy synth riff."
49:09;49:11;"Check this out, let's just listen to it."
49:11;49:13;"This came out September '81."
49:13;49:15;"So this is even before Nebraska."
49:15;49:19;"So Bruce is still kind of, I mean his last album would have been The River at this point."
49:19;49:22;"So he's still very much like in the 70s."
49:22;49:24;"And then his boy."
49:24;49:28;"Yeah, '81."
49:28;49:32;"Early J. Giles has so much in common with the E Street Band."
49:32;49:33;"Right."
49:37;49:40;"I don't know, this reminds me so much of Glory Days in particular."
49:40;49:41;"Totally."
49:41;49:45;"Especially because, I guess even lyrically, I mean this is like the goofball version."
49:45;49:48;"Glory Days has a little more gravitas."
49:48;49:56;"But even this is about a guy running into somebody he went to high school with."
49:56;50:00;"I mean running into, I mean."
50:00;50:01;"Seeing her in a magazine."
50:01;50:03;"Seeing her in a girly magazine."
50:03;50:04;"Oh yeah."
50:04;50:05;"Yeah, totally."
50:05;50:07;"My blood runs cold"
50:07;50:09;"My memory has just been sold"
50:09;50:11;"My angel is the centiphone"
50:11;50:13;"Angel is the centiphone"
50:13;50:15;"My blood runs cold"
50:15;50:18;"My memory has just been sold"
50:18;50:22;"Angel is the centiphone"
50:22;50:24;"Slippy notes under the desk"
50:24;50:26;"While I was thinking about her dress"
50:26;50:30;"I was shy, turned away before she caught my eye"
50:30;50:32;"I was shaking in my shoes"
50:32;50:34;"Whenever she flashed those baby blues"
50:34;50:36;"Did something happen to hold on me"
50:36;50:38;"When angel passed close by"
50:38;50:40;"No soft pussy sweater"
50:40;50:42;"Too magical to touch"
50:42;50:44;"To see her in that necklace"
50:44;50:46;"Yeah, it's really just too much"
50:46;50:48;"My blood runs cold"
50:48;50:51;"Yeah, my memory has just been sold"
50:51;50:53;"My angel is the centiphone"
50:53;50:55;"Angel is the centiphone"
50:55;50:57;"My blood runs cold"
50:57;51:00;"My memory has just been sold"
51:00;51:02;"Oh yeah"
51:02;51:04;"Angel is the centiphone"
51:04;51:18;"Now I want to go back and add a chapter about Jay Giles. I didn't delve into Jay Giles"
51:18;51:24;"at all in the book. Well, maybe in 2027 you can do a book about the 45th anniversary of"
51:24;51:31;"centerfold. I'm thinking, oh my God, about 900 pages. I mean, I was looking forward in"
51:31;51:37;"a lot of ways, like where I connected glory days to the song walk of life by Dire Straits."
51:37;51:43;"Oh yeah, totally. Because of the sound and also like the music video for that video is"
51:43;51:49;"like sports bloopers. So there's like a sports theme that's brought in because of the music"
51:49;51:54;"video and just like there was that moment in the 80s like where sports bloopers were"
51:54;52:00;"just huge. And I remember I had like a VHS tape of sports bloopers that I would just"
52:00;52:06;"watch all the time. You could just buy that stuff and it was really popular. I guess stuff"
52:06;52:10;"that you would just go on YouTube now to go see. I feel like people don't get into bloopers"
52:10;52:14;"as much with sports like athletes like, you know, falling down when they're chasing the"
52:14;52:19;"ball or they run into the wall. Like if they're an outfielder trying to catch a home run or"
52:19;52:24;"something. Yeah, it's real baseball based. I feel like the sports bloopers."
52:24;52:28;"Well, yeah, then there's the bloopers like where they're not even bloopers. It's like"
52:28;52:34;"the football bloopers I feel like are usually guys just getting nailed really hard."
52:34;52:35;"With sound effects. Yeah."
52:35;52:41;"It's like it's so dangerous, a football blooper. Right. There's the most like yucks. You can"
52:41;52:43;"get the most yucks out of baseball bloopers."
52:43;52:48;"I think too, like back then there was more AstroTurf. So like the ball was bouncier."
52:48;52:52;"So like if you're playing football and someone fumbles, the ball would bounce in a funnier"
52:52;52:57;"way. Oh, maybe you don't have as many bloopers if you're playing on grass. I don't know."
52:57;52:59;"I don't know if anyone's investigated that."
52:59;53:02;"Were there sports bloopers on America's Funniest Home Videos?"
53:02;53:05;"There's certainly backyard sports bloopers. Backyard sports."
53:05;53:09;"Right. Yeah. Amateur sports bloopers, but not professional."
53:09;53:16;"A lot of wiffle ball bats flying out of the hands of young children towards their father."
53:16;53:22;"Yeah. So anyway, and I love that video for Walk of Life. If I'm feeling sad, I'll watch"
53:22;53:28;"the video for Walk of Life and I'll feel better because I like that song. And sports bloopers,"
53:28;53:32;"you know, pretty funny actually. I got to say I'm making fun of it here a little bit,"
53:32;53:34;"but I do appreciate a good blooper every now and then."
54:51;54:59;"I would say that in terms of like 80s slickness, in terms of whatever you want to call this"
54:59;55:05;"genre is like 70s rockers who like use synths and kind of combine everything. By the time"
55:05;55:08;"you get to Dire Straits, that is like slick."
55:08;55:09;"Right. Dialed in."
55:09;55:13;"That is a fine European production. And you compare that to Born in the USA and Born in"
55:13;55:15;"the USA is very scrappy in comparison."
55:15;55:21;"Right. But I think it's like a similar idea and I don't use this term, but I think it's"
55:21;55:25;"how those records were probably conceived as like yuppie rock."
55:25;55:26;"Right."
55:26;55:32;"You know, that this is a music that if you're in your mid thirties and you have an expensive"
55:32;55:36;"sound system in your car, like these are the kind of records that you're going to be listening"
55:36;55:37;"to."
55:37;55:38;"American psycho music."
55:38;55:43;"Yeah. Yeah. Like, or maybe like a little bit before that. I don't know if like, I don't"
55:43;55:47;"know, people always talk about like what Patrick Bateman would be listening to now if you remade"
55:47;55:52;"American Psycho. And I don't know if like that analogy really carries because I think"
55:52;55:56;"he's such a specific 80s type construction."
55:56;55:58;"Right. He could be listening to almost anything."
55:58;56:03;"Right. I almost feel like the lyrical content of Born in the USA probably wouldn't appeal"
56:03;56:04;"to him."
56:04;56:07;"No. What does he love famously? He loves sports."
56:07;56:14;"Yeah, he listens to this, which was another record that I loved as a kid. And in my mind,"
56:14;56:19;"it wasn't that different from Born in the USA, like sports and Born in the USA. It was"
56:19;56:24;"like the same kind of music, really. Like for me, as like a six year old, it was like,"
56:24;56:30;"oh, this is rock music, you know, and they're not that different, really, if you kind of"
56:30;56:32;"look at it from a certain way."
56:32;56:37;"They're all guys who are like straddling worlds. Like these guys all had roots in like rock"
56:37;56:41;"and roll. If you look at the new romantics or the new wave English people, these are"
56:41;56:48;"like punk rockers who like did not give a shit about like Big Bill Bruns here or any,"
56:48;56:51;"you know what I mean? These guys like could go all the way. But these guys that we're"
56:51;56:56;"talking about, they were trying to marry worlds together. Just sidebar on American Psycho"
56:56;56:58;"in terms of what he'd be listening to now. I don't know why this just popped into my"
56:58;57:03;"head, but I can really picture modern American Psycho monologue. But it's about the Drake"
57:03;57:07;"and Kendrick beef. I don't know why that's so funny to me, because obviously people of"
57:07;57:12;"all walks of life found that interesting. But I could just totally picture like Christian"
57:12;57:17;"Bale just being like, now a lot of people say that Kendrick handily won the battle."
57:17;57:21;"But I have to say, some of Drake's bars and family matters. I could just like, yeah, because"
57:21;57:25;"especially maybe I kind of know this dude, like a New York finance dude who probably"
57:25;57:29;"followed that beef so intently. You could see those guys sitting at the table at the"
57:29;57:34;"fancy restaurant just being like, all right, fellas, hands up. Who thinks that Drake had"
57:34;57:37;"some bars?"
57:37;57:41;"On the Bruce Springsteen subreddit, there's a whole section of Patrick Bateman Reviews"
57:41;57:46;"Your Favorite Bruce Springsteen Song. Candy's Room isn't one of the quintessential songs"
57:46;57:50;"on Darkness on the Edge of Town, but contains a style Springsteen would employ throughout"
57:50;57:57;"his several albums. Most famously, Born in the USA, an uptempo, high-energy rocker veiled"
57:57;58:02;"in optimism, but much darker in subject matter. The track doesn't focus on a delusional narrator"
58:02;58:06;"who fails to acknowledge the hopelessness of the present situation, namely that he's"
58:06;58:13;"another customer of his beloved Candy, a hard body. I mean, that's really perfect. A hard"
58:13;58:17;"body who takes quote strangers from the city and guides them through the darkness of her"
58:17;58:22;"hallway so that she can enjoy the toys they bring. The narrator notices, but chooses to"
58:22;58:29;"ignore the quote sadness hidden in that pretty face. I mean, there's hundreds of these."
58:30;58:36;"In Candy's room, there are pictures of her heroes on the wall. They get to Candy's room,"
58:36;58:43;"hit a wall, the darkness, the Candy's hall. Strangers from the city call my baby's number"
58:43;58:50;"and they bring her toys. When I come knocking, she smiles pretty. She knows I might be Candy's"
58:50;58:52;"boy."
58:52;59:03;"There's a sadness hidden in that pretty face. A sadness all her own, from which no man can"
59:03;59:12;"keep Candy safe. We kiss. My heart rushes through my brain. And her blood rushes in my veins."
59:12;59:22;"My fire rushes through the sky. I go driving, driving deep into the night. I go driving"
59:22;59:30;"deep into the light in Candy's eyes. She says, ""Baby, if you wanna be wild, you got a lot"
59:30;59:40;"to learn. Close your eyes, let them melt, let them fire, let them burn."" 'Cause in the"
59:40;59:50;"darkness, a being worth his shine. When old Candy blows, she makes the city world's heart"
59:50;59:52;"beat."
59:52;59:56;"I mean, like, the joke of that book, when it goes into those sections in the movie as"
59:56;01:00:03;"well, is that he's using music critic language to talk about records that maybe music critics"
01:00:03;01:00:08;"at the time wouldn't have been talking about in those terms. And I have to say, as a music"
01:00:08;01:00:15;"critic myself, I always have that fear that you are writing about a record or a song in"
01:00:15;01:00:23;"that very sort of stilted, over-serious language, you know? 'Cause it is a brilliant satire"
01:00:23;01:00:26;"of just music critic language."
01:00:26;01:00:30;"Right. Well, also, I never thought about the fact that, like, when did that book actually"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"come out, in the '80s?"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"It was '91, I think it came out."
01:00:34;01:00:39;"So, you're Bredi Stenellis or whatever, and you know that your friends and the type of"
01:00:39;01:00:44;"readers and critics who would, you know, engage with your book, there's something about you"
01:00:44;01:00:50;"using that highfalutin language to talk about Huey Lewis that just would have seemed crazy"
01:00:50;01:00:56;"at the time. But in retrospect, didn't Patrick Bateman win? Isn't that, like..."
01:00:56;01:01:00;"Well, that's the thing, is that, you know, yeah, like, when that book was written, it"
01:01:00;01:01:06;"was at a time when you could make a joke about someone over-intellectualizing Huey Lewis"
01:01:06;01:01:12;"in the news, or Phil Collins, or the Whitney Houston song ""Greatest Love of All,"" and it"
01:01:12;01:01:15;"would register as a joke. 'Cause it's like, why would anyone write about Phil Collins"
01:01:15;01:01:21;"with this level of critical analysis? And of course, now, this is why maybe you can't"
01:01:21;01:01:25;"do a Patrick Bateman analogy, is that everything is written about like that."
01:01:25;01:01:26;"Right."
01:01:26;01:01:29;"You know, like, there's no artist where you're like, ""Oh, it's weird that you're"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"over-intellectualizing this."""
01:01:30;01:01:31;"Yeah."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"Like, every artist gets over-intellectualized now."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"And it's almost like the poppier the better."
01:01:35;01:01:36;"Right."
01:01:36;01:01:40;"It's almost like you get more eye rolls from, like, analyzing something that's, like,"
01:01:40;01:01:44;"kind of on its face more intellectual. It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where it's actually"
01:01:44;01:01:49;"like, no, it's like, no pun intended, it's a sport to, like, try to really engage with,"
01:01:49;01:01:54;"like, kind of very mainstream things. I mean, also, I'm not saying this, but I imagine"
01:01:54;01:02:00;"people have had some fun imagining if Patrick Bateman was a Swifty. That's not hard to picture."
01:02:00;01:02:03;"It's him just going deep on the albums."
01:02:03;01:02:09;"Yeah, you know, as a hardcore fan of American Psycho, I think that the whole idea, whether"
01:02:09;01:02:14;"it's fashion at the time, you know, because he goes so deep on fashion, it's just that"
01:02:14;01:02:16;"all the things that have no depth or substance."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"Right."
01:02:17;01:02:20;"Right. That's just a sheen, he goes very deep on."
01:02:20;01:02:21;"The business cards, right."
01:02:21;01:02:26;"The business, yeah. So, pop music. But so it's, yeah, you can absolutely see a pitch"
01:02:26;01:02:32;"fork that is doing a very in-depth analysis of a Dua Lipa album. And so that doesn't make"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"it funny anymore."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"Yeah."
01:02:35;01:02:41;"It's actually eerie to picture American Psycho 2024, and it's just some guy living in a luxury"
01:02:41;01:02:47;"apartment in the city, and he's going deep talking about Drake and Taylor Swift, and"
01:02:47;01:02:53;"he's, you know, doing online shopping and, you know, browsing essence or whatever, just"
01:02:53;01:02:57;"talking about like, you know, some of what's happening in streetwear right now. And you"
01:02:57;01:03:02;"can picture the whole book and people would just read it and be like, what's the joke?"
01:03:02;01:03:05;"What's interesting about this? You're just describing a normal guy."
01:03:05;01:03:06;"What's psychotic about this?"
01:03:06;01:03:07;"Yeah, yeah."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"Maybe it would be like."
01:03:09;01:03:11;"It'd be called American Guy."
01:03:11;01:03:12;"Normie."
01:03:12;01:03:13;"American Normie."
01:03:13;01:03:19;"But maybe he'd be writing about like 21 Pilots or something or like stuff that's like really"
01:03:19;01:03:20;"people do that."
01:03:20;01:03:23;"No, but even that would not be. Yeah, there would just be nothing novel about it."
01:03:23;01:03:28;"What if he like was like, I found a Creed CD in a shoebox in the back of my closet and"
01:03:28;01:03:32;"I threw that and he does like two pages on like the Creed record. Even that it's not."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"I'm just trying to think of something beyond the pale."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"Nothing shocking, man."
01:03:35;01:03:36;"Nothing."
01:03:36;01:03:42;"There are so many revisionist think pieces that have come out since American Psycho was"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"published and even the movie was made."
01:03:44;01:03:51;"I don't think there's any artist that you could have a psychotic person talk about and"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"have it register as crazy."
01:03:53;01:03:57;"It would have to be Patrick Bateman reviews like the Despicable Me movies or something."
01:03:57;01:03:59;"I mean, just something."
01:03:59;01:04:00;"No, even that."
01:04:00;01:04:01;"Even that."
01:04:01;01:04:02;"In Kanto."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"No, or even like."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"In Kanto."
01:04:04;01:04:05;"Hamilton."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"No, wait, he'd be like just a Disney adult."
01:04:07;01:04:08;"Right."
01:04:08;01:04:09;"OK, yeah, there are those."
01:04:09;01:04:11;"Yeah, people would be like, leave him alone, man."
01:04:11;01:04:13;"There's nothing that seems."
01:04:13;01:04:14;"There's nothing pop."
01:04:14;01:04:22;"There's nothing that is just like thought like you could just approach and receive thoughtless."
01:04:22;01:04:26;"No, I was going to say like obscure items in the Taco Bell menu that there's I'm sure"
01:04:26;01:04:27;"there's weird."
01:04:27;01:04:28;"That's what we do."
01:04:28;01:04:29;"Tongue in cheek."
01:04:29;01:04:30;"But yes."
01:04:30;01:04:31;"Yeah, but that's them saying tongue in cheek or not."
01:04:31;01:04:32;"Right."
01:04:32;01:04:39;"Being like obsessively interested in mainstream pop music, restaurants, clothes and wellness."
01:04:39;01:04:43;"Like all the things are supposed to make him psycho, like wearing the ice mask."
01:04:43;01:04:47;"And it's like this mother put on five things on his face before he even went out."
01:04:47;01:04:50;"And people be like, yeah, it's called self-care."
01:04:50;01:04:51;"You just be a hero."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"Skincare routine."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"Drop the skincare routine, Bateman."
01:04:55;01:04:56;"Dude, American normie."
01:04:56;01:04:57;"American normie."
01:04:57;01:04:58;"Wow."
01:04:58;01:05:05;"I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser."
01:05:05;01:05:23;"I should not be left to my own devices."
01:05:23;01:05:43;"I end up in crisis."
01:05:43;01:06:05;"I forget who said that, but the point in the film that he's talking about these things"
01:06:05;01:06:10;"because they signify maybe a certain kind of status or he's in a lot of ways, I think"
01:06:10;01:06:15;"pretending to be a human being and he's doing things that he thinks human beings do."
01:06:15;01:06:19;"And he thinks this music is signifying that."
01:06:19;01:06:25;"I don't know if music necessarily has the power to signify that sort of thing anymore."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"Maybe in the same way that it did in the 80s."
01:06:27;01:06:32;"I feel like people's relationship to music has changed and it would just have to be something"
01:06:32;01:06:33;"else."
01:06:33;01:06:35;"I'd like to think that he's maybe in that like AI type stuff."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"Like he likes AI created art."
01:06:37;01:06:41;"But maybe that's too on the nose."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"I don't know."
01:06:42;01:06:43;"I just think he's an 80s character."
01:06:43;01:06:44;"I don't think that you can."
01:06:44;01:06:45;"Right."
01:06:45;01:06:46;"Yeah, you're totally right."
01:06:46;01:06:47;"Yeah."
01:06:47;01:06:49;"He's definitely a creature of the 80s."
01:06:49;01:06:54;"When I think about how I would create the American psycho of today, I just can't say"
01:06:54;01:06:55;"any of it."
01:06:55;01:06:58;"I'd have to really throw some musician under the bus."
01:06:58;01:07:02;"I have a few good ideas, but it would just seem too cruel."
01:07:02;01:07:03;"Not worth it."
01:07:03;01:07:04;"Yeah, it's not worth it."
01:07:04;01:07:09;"I think the thing that's interesting about Born in the USA 2 is I feel like a lot of"
01:07:09;01:07:16;"times Madonna, Michael Jackson and Bruce are seen as a trio of the superstars of the 80s."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"And Prince."
01:07:17;01:07:18;"I think Prince."
01:07:18;01:07:19;"And Prince."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"Yeah."
01:07:20;01:07:21;"Okay."
01:07:21;01:07:22;"Those are the four horse people."
01:07:22;01:07:26;"And Bruce is like certainly the oldest by a long shot, right?"
01:07:26;01:07:27;"Yeah."
01:07:27;01:07:32;"I mean, I think he's like about a decade older than MJ and Prince."
01:07:32;01:07:34;"I think Madonna must have been born around that same time."
01:07:34;01:07:35;"Yeah."
01:07:35;01:07:38;"Those other three are probably within a few years of each other."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"Born 40, 49, 50."
01:07:39;01:07:40;"Oh, sorry."
01:07:40;01:07:42;"He was 35 in 84."
01:07:42;01:07:43;"Yeah."
01:07:43;01:07:51;"And also, actually, I'm curious if anybody can think of a comparable gap between two"
01:07:51;01:07:54;"monster albums by an artist."
01:07:54;01:07:55;"You know what I mean?"
01:07:55;01:07:58;"Like, of course, there's many artists who just keep chugging, but there's something"
01:07:58;01:08:02;"about Bruce has two monster albums, right?"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"Born to Run and Born in the USA."
01:08:04;01:08:07;"And Stephen, those are like far and away his biggest commercial successes."
01:08:07;01:08:09;"Yeah, I think that's fair to say."
01:08:09;01:08:12;"Although Born in the USA is like a lot."
01:08:12;01:08:15;"Even that is just like crazy orders of magnitude."
01:08:15;01:08:17;"But like, those are his biggest hits."
01:08:17;01:08:22;"Obviously, if you're a fan, he's got so much great material in between."
01:08:22;01:08:27;"And you know, once he was going, he never, until the 90s, he never really hit like a"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"significant downturn."
01:08:29;01:08:35;"But nine years between like monster albums, it's atypical, right?"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"Like age 25 and age 35."
01:08:37;01:08:41;"Well, like, so Michael Jackson's biggest albums, I mean, it's almost nine years, but they were"
01:08:41;01:08:43;"back to back to back."
01:08:43;01:08:49;"Off the Wall, Thriller, Bad, that's one giant imperial phase."
01:08:49;01:08:51;"From 79 to 87."
01:08:51;01:08:55;"And then, you know, by Dangerous, he's still huge, but it's a new decade."
01:08:55;01:08:59;"And Dangerous is a massive album, but it's not as big as those three."
01:08:59;01:09:00;"I'm just trying to think like..."
01:09:00;01:09:08;"I mean, Taylor Swift sort of had a dip where she had 1989 and then Reputation wasn't as"
01:09:08;01:09:09;"popular."
01:09:09;01:09:13;"There was, I think, my memory of that time is that there was an idea that she was going,"
01:09:13;01:09:16;"that she peaked and then she was going to go down."
01:09:16;01:09:17;"Lover."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"And Reputation."
01:09:18;01:09:19;"And Lover, I think, did pretty well."
01:09:19;01:09:21;"I think that was the bomb."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"I think that was the one that's considered..."
01:09:23;01:09:24;"Although she never actually has bombed."
01:09:24;01:09:26;"So that's only perception."
01:09:26;01:09:34;"Bruce didn't bomb, although Darkness, I think, was a record that like, he went out of his"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"way not to really promote at all."
01:09:36;01:09:40;"And it didn't do well at the time."
01:09:40;01:09:46;"And they ended up broadcasting all of these concerts from the Darkness tour that ended"
01:09:46;01:09:47;"up being bootleg."
01:09:47;01:09:52;"But like, there were like five shows that were simulcast over radio stations as a way"
01:09:52;01:09:56;"to promote Bruce because the record really wasn't doing anything."
01:09:56;01:09:57;"It was in his flop era."
01:09:57;01:09:58;"Yeah."
01:09:58;01:10:01;"But like, people heard these shows and that tour is amazing."
01:10:01;01:10:07;"And it really helped to spread the word outside the Northeast that Bruce was like this all-time"
01:10:07;01:10:11;"concert performer that leads to the river."
01:10:11;01:10:14;"It's kind of amazing how well Nebraska did it."
01:10:14;01:10:19;"I think in the book, you said it reached like, was it a top 10 album on Billboard?"
01:10:19;01:10:20;"It went to number three."
01:10:20;01:10:21;"That's crazy."
01:10:21;01:10:25;"Nebraska was the number three selling record?"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"It's like, that's nuts to me."
01:10:27;01:10:30;"I don't think it hunkered down very well."
01:10:30;01:10:31;"It was not a big hit."
01:10:31;01:10:35;"I think that was just because the river was such a big record."
01:10:35;01:10:41;"And there was like this expectation or anticipation for a new Bruce record."
01:10:41;01:10:45;"So we're going to buy this, whatever record he puts out, and then they heard it."
01:10:45;01:10:51;"And I think critics love the record, but I think there was some confusion among, certainly"
01:10:51;01:10:55;"his more casual fans who probably wanted more songs like Hungry Heart."
01:10:55;01:11:03;"And here he is writing acoustic songs about murderers and his father and all that kind"
01:11:03;01:11:04;"of stuff."
01:11:04;01:11:07;"John Lindo's banging his head against the wall."
01:11:07;01:11:22;"That's perfect."
01:11:22;01:11:48;"I'm going to see what them racket boys can do."
01:11:48;01:12:08;"We were just listening before the show to the new Eminem single, which in the grand"
01:12:08;01:12:11;"tradition of Eminem opens with his manager, Paul Rosenberg."
01:12:11;01:12:12;"Is that his name?"
01:12:12;01:12:13;"Yeah."
01:12:13;01:12:14;"Call him like, you're killing me, man."
01:12:14;01:12:16;"I can't, I can't be a part of this."
01:12:16;01:12:17;"This new material, dude."
01:12:17;01:12:18;"I'm out."
01:12:18;01:12:22;"It's too bad John Lindo never jumped on."
01:12:22;01:12:23;"Is that Houdini?"
01:12:23;01:12:24;"Yeah, Houdini."
01:12:24;01:12:32;"Because I saw Steve Miller came out and he was thrilled that Eminem samples his song"
01:12:32;01:12:33;"Abracadabra."
01:12:33;01:12:38;"And Steve Miller came out and he, I'm looking this up quick."
01:12:38;01:12:45;"He said that he was really happy that Eminem sampled his song because he considers Eminem"
01:12:45;01:12:46;"a true artist."
01:12:46;01:12:47;"Wow."
01:12:48;01:12:52;"He did not extend the same courtesy to the Grateful Dead."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"We haven't talked about this in a long time on this show."
01:12:54;01:12:55;"Enemy of the show."
01:12:56;01:12:57;"Steve Miller."
01:12:57;01:13:00;"Steve Miller hates the Grateful Dead, loves Eminem."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"So we know he's up for it with those two."
01:13:02;01:13:04;"You got to keep him guessing."
01:13:04;01:13:06;"You would not have expected that."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"He's a wild card, that Steve Miller."
01:13:08;01:13:13;"Well, I mean, I guess the simple psychological analysis is that he's maybe a little bit of"
01:13:13;01:13:14;"an ego."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"Well, we've talked about this on the show, you know, all due respect, Mr. Miller, but"
01:13:17;01:13:22;"you did say kind of rude things about the Grateful Dead, even after Jerry died and even"
01:13:22;01:13:25;"after you opened for them in the late 80s, early 90s."
01:13:25;01:13:30;"And I think, I just imagine he probably did those Grateful Dead opening slots and probably"
01:13:30;01:13:33;"in his head was like, I wrote Fly Like an Eagle."
01:13:33;01:13:36;"These guys never had a song as big as that."
01:13:36;01:13:38;"I wrote the Joker."
01:13:38;01:13:41;"And probably in his mind, he's like, and I'm a better musician than all these guys."
01:13:41;01:13:45;"I'm not saying it's true, but I could see him seeing that because he's like slicker"
01:13:45;01:13:46;"and tighter and whatever."
01:13:46;01:13:51;"And then I could just picture in like 1990 opening for the dead in front of like 80,000"
01:13:51;01:13:54;"people in Las Vegas or whatever."
01:13:54;01:13:58;"He's looking out and he's just like, this is so backwards."
01:13:58;01:13:59;"I could just see him feeling that way."
01:13:59;01:14:03;"Just like, I like, I've got the jams."
01:14:03;01:14:06;"I sold so many more records than these guys in the 70s."
01:14:06;01:14:10;"I can't believe that I'm playing before them."
01:14:10;01:14:14;"I bet he probably thought he was like, they're just doing the most interminable, a good love"
01:14:14;01:14:15;"thing."
01:14:15;01:14:22;"He's just like, I can rip so much harder than Jerry, you know, obviously."
01:14:22;01:14:25;"So I bet he probably, maybe, hopefully he was like, thanks for the opportunity."
01:14:25;01:14:29;"But I just bet after that he was kind of like, it probably just stuck in his craw because"
01:14:29;01:14:36;"he was like, these guys were my peers and they were obviously beneath me."
01:14:36;01:14:40;"And I don't know what happened, you know, in the 80s, but this doesn't make sense that"
01:14:40;01:14:46;"they of all people get this audience and shredders like me don't."
01:14:46;01:14:51;"Whereas Eminem, he's sitting back just being like daydreaming about those royalty checks"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"coming in."
01:14:53;01:14:56;"And he, you know, and Eminem just like from a totally different generation."
01:14:56;01:14:58;"So he's like, thank you for showing me respect, young gun."
01:14:58;01:14:59;"Right."
01:14:59;01:15:00;"Yeah."
01:15:00;01:15:03;"I mean, yeah, I definitely think that there's probably like a flattering thing with Eminem"
01:15:03;01:15:04;"sampling."
01:15:04;01:15:07;"I mean, I think a lot of people look at Eminem as being like still this like really hip and"
01:15:07;01:15:08;"relevant artist."
01:15:08;01:15:13;"And this proves that I'm also hip and relevant because he's sampling my song."
01:15:13;01:15:17;"But maybe there was a reality where in 90, when he was opening for the dead, he was just"
01:15:17;01:15:20;"backstage listening to some golden age hip hop."
01:15:20;01:15:23;"And that's what he was into."
01:15:23;01:15:25;"And Jerry famously did dis rap, right?"
01:15:25;01:15:27;"Said it wasn't music."
01:15:27;01:15:28;"Right."
01:15:28;01:15:29;"Yeah, actually."
01:15:29;01:15:31;"Maybe Steve Miller is coming from like a very, a very positive point of view."
01:15:31;01:15:37;"And he's just like, honestly, Jerry's dismissal of rap just really rubbed me the wrong way,"
01:15:37;01:15:38;"man."
01:15:38;01:15:39;"Not cool."
01:15:39;01:15:40;"Yeah."
01:15:40;01:15:41;"Like they're up there doing Chuck Berry covers."
01:15:41;01:15:42;"And they're dissing rap."
01:15:42;01:15:43;"It's like, Jerry, have you heard Trifold Quest?"
01:15:43;01:15:44;"It's not music."
01:15:44;01:15:45;"It's not music, man."
01:15:45;01:16:07;"Can I kick it?"
01:16:07;01:16:26;"Can I kick it?"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"To all the people who can quest like a tribe does."
01:16:28;01:16:31;"Before this, did you really know what live was?"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"Comprehend to the track for us."
01:16:33;01:16:34;"Why?"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"Cause getting mentions on the tip of the vibe was."
01:16:36;01:16:38;"Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz."
01:16:38;01:16:40;"Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug."
01:16:40;01:16:43;"If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug."
01:16:43;01:16:46;"Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug."
01:16:46;01:16:48;"Afrocentric living is a big shrug."
01:16:48;01:16:49;"A life filled with."
01:16:49;01:16:50;"That's what I love."
01:16:50;01:16:51;"A lower plateau is what we're above."
01:16:51;01:16:52;"If you diss us, we won't even think of."
01:16:52;01:16:53;"We'll nip a dog and give a big shove."
01:16:53;01:16:54;"This rhythm really fits like a slug glove."
01:16:54;01:16:55;"Like a box of positives, it's a plus love."
01:16:55;01:16:56;"As the trial flies high like a dove."
01:16:56;01:16:57;"This African-American rap is a big shrug."
01:16:57;01:16:58;"I'm a big shrug."
01:17:01;01:17:06;"I'm a big shrug."
01:17:06;01:17:07;"I'm a big shrug."
01:17:27;01:17:30;"Wait, hold on."
01:17:30;01:17:34;"Did he just like f*** up the first guitar part?"
01:17:34;01:17:35;"Listen closely to the guitar."
01:17:35;01:17:42;"He just kind of like didn't quite let that one..."
01:17:42;01:17:43;"It works."
01:17:43;01:17:54;"You can't redo it."
01:17:54;01:17:55;"This is '82."
01:17:55;01:17:58;"Again, Jay Galsvan's centerfold."
01:17:58;01:17:59;"These lyrics."
01:17:59;01:18:00;"I'm a big shrug."
01:19:48;01:19:52;"But you gotta give it up to Eminem."
01:19:52;01:19:53;"This is perfect."
01:19:53;01:19:54;"Well look what the stork brung."
01:19:54;01:19:55;"Little baby devil with the forked tongue."
01:19:55;01:19:56;"And it's sticking out, yeah, like a sore thumb."
01:19:56;01:19:57;"With a forehead that it grew horns from."
01:19:57;01:19:58;"Still a white tree."
01:19:58;01:19:59;"Steve Miller listening to this and being like, ""Respect."""
01:19:59;01:20:00;"And I'm like, ""Shit, you all like me."""
01:20:00;01:20:01;"And when I look up and stare at you, I make believe."
01:20:01;01:20:02;"And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me."
01:20:02;01:20:03;"If I was to ever take a leave, it would be as friendly to break your feet."
01:20:05;01:20:17;"If I was to ever take a leave, it would be as friendly to break your feet."
01:20:17;01:20:18;"If I was to ever take a leave, it would be as friendly to break your feet."
01:20:26;01:20:48;"If I was to ever take a leave, it would be as friendly to break your feet."
01:20:48;01:21:17;"If I was to ever take a leave, it would be as friendly to break your feet."
01:21:17;01:21:19;"Do you guys remember this?"
01:21:19;01:21:22;"This is the kid who rewrote American Boy"
01:21:22;01:21:24;"to be about Fortnite."
01:21:24;01:21:25;"- Oh my God."
01:21:25;01:21:27;"- I was obsessed with this song."
01:21:27;01:21:29;"You know American Boy, right?"
01:21:29;01:21:30;"- Wait, who's that by?"
01:21:30;01:21:31;"- Estelle?"
01:21:31;01:21:32;"- Between Kanye? - And Kanye was on the,"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"â™ª You be my American Boy â™ª"
01:21:34;01:21:36;"â™ª We got a number one victory royale â™ª"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"â™ª Yeah, Fortnite, we 'bout to get down â™ª"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"â™ª It's sound, controls on the board right now â™ª"
01:21:40;01:21:43;"â™ª We just wiped out Tomato Town â™ª"
01:21:43;01:21:44;"- Tomato Town!"
01:21:44;01:21:44;"- That's so good!"
01:21:44;01:21:46;"â™ª All the rifles now we're heading southbound â™ª"
01:21:46;01:21:48;"â™ª Now we're in the pleasant park streets â™ª"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"â™ª Look at the map, go to the mark sheet â™ª"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"(laughing)"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"- It's kind of the same energy."
01:21:54;01:21:56;"â™ª You can check me on Steve Wyatt â™ª"
01:21:56;01:21:58;"â™ª What my loot like â™ª"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"â™ª Oh, I really love to â™ª"
01:22:00;01:22:03;"â™ª Chug jug with you â™ª"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"- We can be pro Fortnite gamers!"
01:22:05;01:22:10;"â™ª He says, hey broski â™ª"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"â™ª You got some heals in the shield pot â™ª"
01:22:12;01:22:16;"â™ª I need healing and I am only at one HP â™ª"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"â™ª Hey dude, sorry â™ª"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"â™ª I found nothing on this safari â™ª"
01:22:20;01:22:22;"â™ª I checked the upstairs of that house â™ª"
01:22:22;01:22:24;"â™ª But not the underneath yet â™ª"
01:22:24;01:22:27;"â™ª There's a chest that's just down there â™ª"
01:22:27;01:22:28;"â™ª The storm is coming fast â™ª"
01:22:28;01:22:31;"â™ª And you need heals to prepare â™ª"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"â™ª I've got the bucks that I'll spend â™ª"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"â™ª More than you can contend â™ª"
01:22:35;01:22:38;"â™ª I'm a cool pro Fortnite gamer â™ª"
01:22:38;01:22:39;"â™ª Cool pro Fortnite â™ª"
01:22:39;01:22:43;"â™ª Take me to your Xbox to play Fortnite today â™ª"
01:22:43;01:22:45;"â™ª You can check me on Steve Wyatt â™ª"
01:22:45;01:22:47;"â™ª What my loot like â™ª"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"â™ª I really love to â™ª"
01:22:49;01:22:52;"â™ª Chug jug with you â™ª"
01:22:52;01:22:57;"â™ª We can be pro Fortnite gamers â™ª"
01:22:57;01:23:01;"â™ª La la la la la la la â™ª"
01:23:01;01:23:05;"â™ª La la la la la la la â™ª"
01:23:05;01:23:08;"â™ª La la la la la la la â™ª"
01:23:08;01:23:11;"â™ª You'll be my pro Fortnite gamer â™ª"
01:23:11;01:23:12;"â™ª Pro Fortnite gamer â™ª"
01:23:12;01:23:15;"- I don't understand any of the references in this."
01:23:15;01:23:15;"- Oh, I do."
01:23:15;01:23:17;"- But I just always love,"
01:23:17;01:23:18;"â™ª 10 kills on the board right now â™ª"
01:23:18;01:23:21;"â™ª Just wiped out Tomato Town â™ª"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"(laughing)"
01:23:23;01:23:24;"- Oh my God."
01:23:24;01:23:26;"â™ª I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bro â™ª"
01:23:26;01:23:28;"(laughing)"
01:23:28;01:23:32;"- But he's parodying himself, you know?"
01:23:32;01:23:33;"That's what's incredible."
01:23:33;01:23:36;"- He's done this thing like where,"
01:23:36;01:23:37;"like later career Eminem,"
01:23:37;01:23:40;"like where he samples classic rock songs."
01:23:40;01:23:41;"- A lot."
01:23:41;01:23:42;"- Aerosmith."
01:23:42;01:23:44;"- Aerosmith, there was like a,"
01:23:44;01:23:46;"'cause like the last Eminem record"
01:23:46;01:23:47;"I really paid attention to"
01:23:47;01:23:50;"was like the Marshall Mathers LP Part II."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"- That came out like 10 years ago."
01:23:52;01:23:55;"And like he samples like Joe Walsh on there,"
01:23:55;01:23:56;"Life's Been Good."
01:23:56;01:23:59;"There's like a Zombies song that he samples on there."
01:23:59;01:24:00;"- Really?"
01:24:00;01:24:01;"- Yeah, like."
01:24:01;01:24:01;"- He knows his (beep)"
01:24:01;01:24:03;"- Yeah, so he's like, I don't know,"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"as he's aged, he's just, you know,"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"listening to like the classic rock"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"and oldie stations, I guess."
01:24:09;01:24:10;"- Okay, how about Eminem."
01:24:10;01:24:12;"- He's getting ideas for samples."
01:24:12;01:24:13;"- Eminem and Bruce."
01:24:14;01:24:15;"(laughing)"
01:24:15;01:24:19;"I don't know, you just got an assignment to write a book."
01:24:19;01:24:20;"- Right."
01:24:20;01:24:21;"- That's all I'm telling you."
01:24:21;01:24:22;"- American Heartland."
01:24:22;01:24:23;"- Eminem and Bruce,"
01:24:23;01:24:26;"we need the first draft in three months."
01:24:26;01:24:27;"Where are you going?"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"- Yeah, we need the worst music book ever written."
01:24:29;01:24:31;"- Well, hold on."
01:24:31;01:24:32;"- The draft in three months."
01:24:32;01:24:35;"Oh man, you're putting me on the spot here."
01:24:35;01:24:37;"I mean, okay, I'm just spitballing here."
01:24:37;01:24:41;"I would probably have,"
01:24:42;01:24:45;"you know, I would contrast their views"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"of blue collar America."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"Like how Bruce wrote about blue collar Americans"
01:24:49;01:24:52;"in the 80s versus Eminem,"
01:24:52;01:24:55;"like what he did like in the late 90s, early 2000s,"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"like the sort of trailer park,"
01:24:57;01:25:01;"like motif of like a lot of his songs,"
01:25:01;01:25:02;"I feel like early on."
01:25:02;01:25:03;"So that's my pitch."
01:25:03;01:25:04;"That's off the top of the dome"
01:25:04;01:25:06;"for like the worst music book of all time."
01:25:06;01:25:09;"- I think there could be something to it."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"- Have you guys watched the ""Bagbra,"""
01:25:11;01:25:14;"I mean the Houdini music video?"
01:25:14;01:25:16;"- Can you work back on this?"
01:25:16;01:25:17;"- No, 'cause I just like,"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"to me the concept is, you know,"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"what if Slim Shady was today?"
01:25:21;01:25:22;"'Cause he comes through a porthole, right?"
01:25:22;01:25:26;"He opens a wormhole through the fabric of space and time"
01:25:26;01:25:29;"and the doctor is like, you got, right, you gotta come."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"And then what he sees is like one of those like"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"robot food delivery trucks."
01:25:33;01:25:34;"And then he looks up to a window,"
01:25:34;01:25:36;"there's a guy wearing a VR headset"
01:25:36;01:25:40;"and Shady's Eminem voice, he's like, what the (beep)"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"and then he doesn't talk about any of it on the song."
01:25:42;01:25:46;"He talks about R. Kelly and you know, whatever else anyway."
01:25:46;01:25:47;"- Hitting eight year olds in the face."
01:25:47;01:25:48;"- Right, missed opportunity."
01:25:48;01:25:51;"- Has Bruce ever commented on Eminem?"
01:25:51;01:25:54;"- That didn't come up for me, I don't know."
01:25:54;01:25:56;"- Let's do some digging."
01:25:56;01:25:57;"- You're on a targeted search?"
01:25:57;01:26:00;"- Okay, but as the editor who assigned you this book,"
01:26:00;01:26:01;"I can say you're definitely going to the right place."
01:26:01;01:26:04;"It's gotta be something about blue collar America,"
01:26:04;01:26:05;"compare and contrast."
01:26:05;01:26:08;"And I guess it's fair to say that like they,"
01:26:08;01:26:12;"at the respective moments, they were the guy."
01:26:12;01:26:12;"- Right."
01:26:12;01:26:15;"- You know, who was telling that story."
01:26:15;01:26:17;"Who wore it on their sleeve."
01:26:17;01:26:18;"- Guys, I'm sorry to interrupt."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"- Yeah."
01:26:19;01:26:21;"- This is from the Eminem subreddit."
01:26:21;01:26:24;"Bruce Springsteen comforted Eminem after the Eminem show"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"and Springsteen's ""The Rising"" both got sniped"
01:26:26;01:26:29;"and Nora Jones has come away with me."
01:26:29;01:26:30;"So here's the story."
01:26:30;01:26:33;"As album of the year award brought the evening to a close,"
01:26:33;01:26:37;"nominees Eminem and Bruce Springsteen stood backstage"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"at Madison Square Garden, watching a monitor"
01:26:39;01:26:40;"as their names were announced."
01:26:40;01:26:42;"When Nora Jones was declared the winner,"
01:26:42;01:26:45;"completing her Grammy sweep, Em's head sank."
01:26:45;01:26:49;"The boss noticing simply put his arm around Shady's shoulder"
01:26:49;01:26:52;"and the two walked off together into the shadows."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"(laughing)"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"- We gotta find out what they,"
01:26:55;01:26:58;"we gotta find out what they talked about."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"(soft music)"
01:27:00;01:27:05;"â™ª I waited till I saw the sun â™ª"
01:27:06;01:27:11;"â™ª Don't know why I didn't come â™ª"
01:27:11;01:27:17;"â™ª I left you by the house of fun â™ª"
01:27:17;01:27:22;"â™ª Don't know why I didn't come â™ª"
01:27:22;01:27:28;"â™ª Don't know why I didn't come â™ª"
01:27:28;01:27:33;"â™ª When I saw the break of day â™ª"
01:27:34;01:27:39;"â™ª I wished that I could fly away â™ª"
01:27:39;01:27:44;"â™ª Instead of kneeling in the sand â™ª"
01:27:44;01:27:49;"â™ª Catching teardrops in my hand â™ª"

01:28:01;01:28:05;"â™ª You'll be on my mind forever â™ª"
01:28:05;01:28:14;"- I looked up Bruce and Eminem"
01:28:14;01:28:18;"and apparently there's a song from 2017"
01:28:18;01:28:20;"where Eminem makes a Bruce Springsteen reference."
01:28:20;01:28:22;"- Yes, I just queued it up."
01:28:22;01:28:23;"Let's find it."
01:28:23;01:28:23;"- Okay."
01:28:23;01:28:26;"God, this is deep Eminem."
01:28:26;01:28:28;"Oof."
01:28:30;01:28:31;"One thing I'll say about Eminem"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"that he has in common with Bruce"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"is that they always go for it."
01:28:35;01:28:38;"Whenever I hear like a deeper Bruce song I never heard"
01:28:38;01:28:41;"or a deeper Eminem song from an era I don't know that well,"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"I'm always struck by the fact that they,"
01:28:43;01:28:49;"I don't know, like they try, there's passion there."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"You know, they both,"
01:28:51;01:28:55;"they're both like real hard workers."
01:28:58;01:28:59;"- Yeah."
01:28:59;01:29:02;"- There is like a mythology about Eminem"
01:29:02;01:29:03;"that he was in the movie ""8 Mile"""
01:29:03;01:29:05;"that he was this outsider."
01:29:05;01:29:07;"I mean, I think people look at that movie"
01:29:07;01:29:08;"as being like the Eminem story"
01:29:08;01:29:10;"even though it's obviously fictionalized"
01:29:10;01:29:13;"but that he was like this guy who came from nothing"
01:29:13;01:29:16;"and pulled himself up and became this huge star."
01:29:16;01:29:18;"You know, that classic American story."
01:29:18;01:29:19;"- Yeah."
01:29:19;01:29:22;"- And there's certainly some mythology with Bruce as well."
01:29:22;01:29:25;"- Wait, check this out."
01:29:25;01:29:26;"â™ª To get a floozy inside that jacuzzi â™ª"
01:29:26;01:29:27;"â™ª And have a loosey goosey â™ª"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"â™ª It's what it ooze â™ª"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"â™ª But I am to rap â™ª"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"â™ª What blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen â™ª"
01:29:32;01:29:33;"â™ª Glued we be â™ª"
01:29:33;01:29:33;"â™ª I'm true TV â™ª"
01:29:33;01:29:34;"â™ª You're too PG â™ª"
01:29:34;01:29:35;"â™ª I'm schooled â™ª"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"- Oh, 'cause he's wearing tight blue jeans."
01:29:37;01:29:38;"- Let's run that back."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"â™ª Goosey goosey â™ª"
01:29:39;01:29:40;"â™ª It's what it ooze â™ª"
01:29:40;01:29:41;"â™ª But I am to rap â™ª"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"â™ª What blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen â™ª"
01:29:43;01:29:44;"â™ª Glued we be â™ª"
01:29:44;01:29:45;"â™ª I'm Bruce Springsteen â™ª"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"(laughing)"
01:29:47;01:29:50;"- Is it, ""I am to rap what blue jeans mean"
01:29:50;01:29:51;"""to Bruce Springsteen""?"
01:29:51;01:29:52;"- Glued."
01:29:52;01:29:54;"- What Bruce Springs mean to, yeah."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"- Because he's wearing those tight pants,"
01:29:56;01:29:57;"they're glued on."
01:29:57;01:30:00;"- The tightness of Bruce's ""Born in the USA"" jeans"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"has been wildly overstated after the years."
01:30:02;01:30:03;"- Yeah, it's not that tight."
01:30:03;01:30:04;"- Take a look at it, people."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"And that was also in an era."
01:30:06;01:30:08;"- Yeah, it's pretty loose and boxy,"
01:30:08;01:30:09;"like if you look at the live clips."
01:30:09;01:30:12;"- And people weren't quite as obsessed with butts"
01:30:12;01:30:14;"in the mainstream."
01:30:14;01:30:17;"I bet in all that time when Bruce was lifting weights,"
01:30:17;01:30:19;"and actually we were talking earlier about him pumping iron,"
01:30:19;01:30:21;"getting ready for this album."
01:30:21;01:30:22;"I kind of remember,"
01:30:22;01:30:24;"maybe this is more top of mind for you, Stephen."
01:30:24;01:30:27;"In his book, there's something I always think about"
01:30:27;01:30:28;"when I'm lifting weights,"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"and it's Bruce's own description of lifting weights"
01:30:30;01:30:31;"in this period."
01:30:31;01:30:33;"And maybe this is part of what you were saying"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"with him being somewhat dismissive of this album"
01:30:35;01:30:38;"or not as proud of it as you might think."
01:30:38;01:30:38;"He says something,"
01:30:38;01:30:41;"""When I think back to that era of lifting weights,"
01:30:41;01:30:46;"""these just pointless hours of my arms moving up and down"
01:30:46;01:30:47;"""with weights."""
01:30:47;01:30:49;"He has some funny description"
01:30:49;01:30:51;"of where he's describing lifting weights"
01:30:51;01:30:55;"as being the most mundane, stupid thing he ever did."
01:30:55;01:30:57;"I just remember this thing, pointless hours spent."
01:30:57;01:30:58;"- Yeah."
01:30:58;01:31:00;"- They're also connected."
01:31:00;01:31:02;"On November 14th, 2014,"
01:31:02;01:31:05;"Fox News declared Eminem and Bruce Springsteen"
01:31:05;01:31:06;"fools of the week."
01:31:06;01:31:07;"- Fools of the week."
01:31:07;01:31:08;"- Oh, wow."
01:31:08;01:31:11;"- Because they both performed at a concert of valor"
01:31:11;01:31:12;"on Veterans Day,"
01:31:12;01:31:17;"and both dropped either F-bombs or anti-war sentiments"
01:31:18;01:31:22;"that made them brothers in being fools of the week."
01:31:22;01:31:26;"So maybe that's where that--"
01:31:26;01:31:26;"- There's a lot there."
01:31:26;01:31:29;"Also this album, this song we just listened to"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"with the Bruce Springsteen lyric,"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"it's an Eminem album called ""Revival."""
01:31:33;01:31:35;"The cover is an American flag."
01:31:35;01:31:36;"- There we go."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"- Oh, there you go."
01:31:38;01:31:40;"It all connects."
01:31:40;01:31:43;"- Eminem's got a song on that album with Alicia Keys"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"where they try to do an empire state of mind,"
01:31:45;01:31:47;"but about America."
01:31:47;01:31:50;"- It's like very broad and very nationalistic."
01:31:50;01:31:51;"It's like an anti-Trump."
01:31:51;01:31:53;"He has a whole verse about Trump."
01:31:53;01:31:56;"- That's something he has in common with Bruce."
01:31:56;01:31:57;"They both hate Trump."
01:31:57;01:31:57;"- Mm."
01:31:58;01:31:59;"- Yo."
01:31:59;01:32:02;"Shout to everybody"
01:32:02;01:32:05;"who's been on this trip with me."
01:32:05;01:32:06;"- Everybody."
01:32:06;01:32:09;"- You don't have to agree,"
01:32:09;01:32:13;"but if you feel like me."
01:32:13;01:32:16;"Someone get this shit."
01:32:16;01:32:18;"Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare"
01:32:18;01:32:19;"to get impeached."
01:32:19;01:32:20;"Everybody on your feet."
01:32:20;01:32:22;"This is where terrorism and hair was a meat"
01:32:22;01:32:23;"square off in the street."
01:32:23;01:32:25;"This chump barely even sleeps."
01:32:25;01:32:27;"All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"and repeats while he looks like a canary with a beak."
01:32:29;01:32:30;"Why you think he banned transgenders"
01:32:30;01:32:32;"from the military with a tweet?"
01:32:32;01:32:33;"He's trying to divide us."
01:32:33;01:32:35;"This shit's like a cult, but like Johnny,"
01:32:35;01:32:36;"he'll only unite us."
01:32:36;01:32:37;"- I think this is the roughest stuff"
01:32:37;01:32:38;"we've ever played on this."
01:32:38;01:32:39;"(laughing)"
01:32:39;01:32:40;"- Similar to when two cars collide,"
01:32:40;01:32:43;"'cause our spirits crushed in the spot to type one."
01:32:43;01:32:44;"- This is from 2017."
01:32:44;01:32:45;"- Here's where the cause of life comes."
01:32:45;01:32:46;"To pull us from the wreckage,"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"that's what we get pride from."
01:32:48;01:32:50;"When we came from a star to a strike."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"- There's this whole era of Eminem that like,"
01:32:52;01:32:53;"I don't know."
01:32:53;01:32:55;"- This is the awfully hot, coffee pot era."
01:32:55;01:32:56;"- Yeah. - Oh yeah."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"â™ª Band together for Charlottesville â™ª"
01:32:58;01:32:59;"â™ª And for heaven â™ª"
01:32:59;01:33:00;"- Like, the last, like I said,"
01:33:00;01:33:03;"the last album I know of is from 10 years ago."
01:33:03;01:33:04;"And then I feel like I just,"
01:33:04;01:33:07;"I'm checked out ever since then."
01:33:07;01:33:08;"- Dude, I think that there really is a connection"
01:33:08;01:33:11;"between Eminem and Bruce for this book."
01:33:11;01:33:13;"They both care about this country."
01:33:13;01:33:14;"They're, you know."
01:33:14;01:33:17;"â™ª Here to the land that made me â™ª"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"â™ª That made me who I am â™ª"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"- They're basically embracing patriotism"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"from the position of the Democratic Party."
01:33:23;01:33:25;"â™ª Here to the land that raised me â™ª"
01:33:25;01:33:30;"â™ª This one for the only place that really knows me â™ª"
01:33:30;01:33:34;"â™ª For the cracks in the road that drove me â™ª"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"â™ª There's no place like home â™ª"
01:33:36;01:33:37;"â™ª Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya? â™ª"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"â™ª Can't denounce the Klan 'cause they play golf with ya â™ª"
01:33:39;01:33:42;"â™ª You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off â™ª"
01:33:42;01:33:43;"â™ª I do not see a way y'all differ â™ª"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"â™ª And all you gotta race cards big as the â™ª"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"â™ª With your name carved in it should be your trademark â™ª"
01:33:47;01:33:48;"â™ª 'Cause hate's all you played off â™ª"
01:33:48;01:33:49;"â™ª And you just lick the plate off â™ª"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"â™ª So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos â™ª"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"â™ª So basically you ate off â™ª"
01:33:53;01:33:54;"â™ª But you ain't ruining our country, punk â™ª"
01:33:54;01:33:56;"â™ª Or taking our pride from us â™ª"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"â™ª You won't define us 'cause like a dictionary â™ª"
01:33:58;01:33:59;"â™ª Things are looking up so much â™ª"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"â™ª Gotta sprain neck, know we will rise up â™ª"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"â™ª Against this train wreck and take a stand â™ª"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"â™ª Even if it means sitting when they raise the flag â™ª"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"â™ª The same, the star-spangled banner â™ª"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"â™ª This man just praised the statue of General Lee â™ª"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"â™ª 'Cause he generally hates the black people â™ª"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"â™ª The great Hispanics take it back â™ª"
01:34:13;01:34:15;"â™ª To the shady national convention â™ª"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"â™ª Wish I would've spit on it before I went to shake his hand â™ª"
01:34:17;01:34:20;"â™ª At the event or maybe had the wherewithal â™ª"
01:34:20;01:34:22;"- So I got three months to write this thing?"
01:34:22;01:34:23;"- You got three months."
01:34:23;01:34:27;"- Yeah, we just wanna get it up before the election."
01:34:27;01:34:30;"I think this could be really big leading into,"
01:34:30;01:34:31;"and somehow work Trump and Biden in there too."
01:34:31;01:34:33;"- Well, do you work Axel Rosen to it too?"
01:34:33;01:34:34;"Because-"
01:34:34;01:34:36;"- Well, they both did it, an ad for,"
01:34:36;01:34:39;"I just read here that they've done an ad for Biden."
01:34:39;01:34:41;"- Eminem and Bruce? - Eminem and Bruce."
01:34:41;01:34:42;"- Is Axel in it?"
01:34:42;01:34:45;"- I mean, I worked Axel into this Bruce-"
01:34:45;01:34:48;"- I really liked how you worked Axel into it."
01:34:48;01:34:51;"- So I can definitely work Axel into a Bruce and Eminem book."
01:34:51;01:34:53;"- Eminem and Bruce brings in support Biden in new ads,"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"so maybe they're separate ads."
01:34:55;01:34:57;"This is just, they let them use their music though, right?"
01:34:57;01:35:01;"It's not like, what Eminem song are you using in the ad?"
01:35:01;01:35:02;"- Stephen, I really liked in the book"
01:35:02;01:35:06;"how you use this album to sort of like talk about music,"
01:35:06;01:35:08;"sort of like kind of contextualize music"
01:35:08;01:35:10;"like ""Guns N' Roses"" that came right after it."
01:35:10;01:35:11;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:35:11;01:35:14;"And that's what I like to do with these books."
01:35:14;01:35:16;"I mean, I always feel like, you know,"
01:35:16;01:35:17;"you're writing about the album,"
01:35:17;01:35:22;"but then I like making connections to other things"
01:35:22;01:35:23;"that were happening at the time"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"that at least to me are significant"
01:35:25;01:35:27;"that help maybe to understand the thing"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"that you're talking about."
01:35:29;01:35:31;"Just talking about like ""Appetite for Destruction"""
01:35:31;01:35:35;"being like, kind of like the next really big rock record"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"that came after ""Born in the USA,"""
01:35:37;01:35:39;"but in a way kind of having the opposite vibe."
01:35:40;01:35:44;"You know, like having a much more sort of like"
01:35:44;01:35:47;"tear everything down type energy"
01:35:47;01:35:48;"versus what Bruce was talking about"
01:35:48;01:35:50;"on the ""Born in the USA"" tour,"
01:35:50;01:35:53;"which was this more sort of like,"
01:35:53;01:35:54;"nobody wins unless everybody wins,"
01:35:54;01:35:56;"like that type of message."
01:35:56;01:35:57;"- It's interesting too,"
01:35:57;01:36:01;"to think about somebody making a superstar giant record"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"at age 35."
01:36:03;01:36:04;"- Yeah."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"- And maybe it's because he was using new technology,"
01:36:06;01:36:10;"but the songs, almost every song on the album"
01:36:10;01:36:15;"is about, in a way about being old or worn out"
01:36:15;01:36:18;"or past your prime."
01:36:18;01:36:21;"It's so unique that a record like that"
01:36:21;01:36:24;"would connect in such a mainstream way."
01:36:24;01:36:25;"- And with children."
01:36:25;01:36:26;"- Yeah, and yeah."
01:36:26;01:36:28;"- With children and adults alike, yeah."
01:36:28;01:36:29;"- Right."
01:36:29;01:36:32;"- 'Cause even what ""Dancing in the Dark"" being like,"
01:36:32;01:36:33;"that's the one that Landau was like,"
01:36:33;01:36:34;"""We need one more hit."""
01:36:34;01:36:35;"- Yeah."
01:36:35;01:36:36;"- And that anybody could relate."
01:36:36;01:36:41;"I guess that's where being 35 and 13 could intersect,"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"is looking in the mirror and wanting to change your hair,"
01:36:43;01:36:44;"your clothes, your face."
01:36:44;01:36:46;"Coming at it from different angles."
01:36:46;01:36:48;"One is a kid going through puberty,"
01:36:48;01:36:50;"just like, ""I feel weird, man."""
01:36:50;01:36:52;"And the other one is just like a guy on the downslope."
01:36:52;01:36:54;"- Just like, ""I drank too much last night."
01:36:54;01:36:56;"Oh God, I'm losing my hair."
01:36:56;01:36:57;"The (beep)"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"The bag's under my eyes."
01:36:59;01:37:02;"It's getting worse and it's never gonna get better."""
01:37:03;01:37:07;"â™ª I get up in the evening â™ª"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"â™ª And I ain't got nothing to say â™ª"
01:37:09;01:37:12;"â™ª I come home in the morning â™ª"
01:37:12;01:37:16;"â™ª I go to bed feeling the same way â™ª"
01:37:16;01:37:19;"â™ª I ain't nothing but tired â™ª"
01:37:19;01:37:23;"â™ª Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself â™ª"
01:37:23;01:37:26;"â™ª Hey there, baby â™ª"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"â™ª I could use just a little help â™ª"
01:37:28;01:37:32;"â™ª You can't start a fire â™ª"
01:37:32;01:37:35;"â™ª You can't start a fire without a spark â™ª"
01:37:35;01:37:38;"â™ª This gun's for hire â™ª"
01:37:38;01:37:41;"â™ª Even if we're just dancing in the dark â™ª"
01:37:41;01:37:44;"- Yeah, I guess there is an intersection there,"
01:37:44;01:37:47;"but yeah, it's all, it's these worn out feelings."
01:37:47;01:37:51;"- But there were a lot of pop stars back then"
01:37:51;01:37:54;"that were guys in their mid thirties."
01:37:54;01:37:56;"Like that was a thing in the mid eighties."
01:37:56;01:37:58;"It was really the end of that."
01:37:58;01:38:01;"Like, it feels like even a few years later,"
01:38:01;01:38:02;"that wasn't gonna be as prevalent,"
01:38:02;01:38:04;"but you know, there were like a lot of these people"
01:38:04;01:38:08;"from the seventies that were able to continue their careers"
01:38:08;01:38:11;"in the eighties and be really big."
01:38:11;01:38:14;"I mean, we talked about Huey Lewis,"
01:38:14;01:38:16;"there's Dire Straits, that's another example."
01:38:16;01:38:18;"- Phil Collins. - Phil Collins, Don Henley,"
01:38:18;01:38:22;"Billy Joel, Paul Oates, you know,"
01:38:22;01:38:25;"all of these people that you look at it now"
01:38:25;01:38:28;"and it's amazing like how many just like,"
01:38:28;01:38:31;"I'm a guy who's 35 and I'm singing"
01:38:31;01:38:33;"about 35 year old guy subjects."
01:38:33;01:38:36;"And that was on the radio, you know?"
01:38:36;01:38:41;"I mean, I think, you know, the boomers were still"
01:38:41;01:38:46;"in control of like what was popular, I think at that time."
01:38:46;01:38:48;"And it wasn't gonna last much longer."
01:38:48;01:38:50;"I mean, because I think by the end of the eighties"
01:38:50;01:38:52;"into the nineties, you have more of a Gen X thing going on."
01:38:52;01:38:53;"- Right. - But there was like"
01:38:53;01:38:57;"this hunger for like, oh, like I'm a parent too"
01:38:57;01:38:59;"and I'm getting older and I'm thinking about like"
01:38:59;01:39:00;"what I was like in high school"
01:39:00;01:39:03;"and I'm gonna buy records that reflect that, you know?"
01:39:03;01:39:06;"And that could be a pop song subject."
01:39:06;01:39:07;"- You know, I think about that show,"
01:39:07;01:39:10;"30 something a lot when I, you know, and--"
01:39:10;01:39:11;"- That from the eighties?"
01:39:11;01:39:12;"- Yeah, 'cause I remember thinking,"
01:39:12;01:39:16;"God, that seems like old, these were old as (beep)"
01:39:16;01:39:19;"Then, you know, immediately after this would come"
01:39:19;01:39:22;"friends, signed, I mean, these are young people, right?"
01:39:22;01:39:23;"The idea of making a TV show about people"
01:39:23;01:39:26;"in their mid thirties and that's the focus."
01:39:26;01:39:28;"I just, you couldn't even imagine now."
01:39:28;01:39:33;"- When I think, yeah, and 35 year olds were older then too."
01:39:33;01:39:34;"I mean, I-- - Yeah, big time."
01:39:34;01:39:37;"- I think a 35 year old now is a lot younger"
01:39:37;01:39:39;"than like a 35 year old in like 1984."
01:39:39;01:39:42;"- Well, I think probably Taylor Swift's probably pretty close"
01:39:42;01:39:44;"she's born in 1989 famously."
01:39:44;01:39:45;"So she's probably pretty close to 35."
01:39:45;01:39:49;"So it's interesting to think about her now"
01:39:49;01:39:52;"being one of the biggest stars in the world and Bruce then."
01:39:52;01:39:55;"And I mean, I guess when you compare,"
01:39:55;01:39:56;"maybe in a way that makes sense,"
01:39:56;01:39:58;"they both been around for a minute."
01:39:58;01:40:01;"They're both like kind of like a uniquely"
01:40:01;01:40:03;"like big phase of their career."
01:40:03;01:40:07;"But even just thematically the Bruce stuff,"
01:40:07;01:40:10;"it'd be interesting to hear a Taylor Swift glory days."
01:40:10;01:40:13;"But also she writes from a different perspective often"
01:40:13;01:40:17;"like the, it seems like lately it's more just her talking"
01:40:17;01:40:19;"about her life and she's so famous people know"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"so many details about her life."
01:40:21;01:40:25;"Whereas like Bruce never quite took it there."
01:40:25;01:40:27;"- That would have been maybe a little bit more"
01:40:27;01:40:28;"tunnel of love."
01:40:28;01:40:30;"You're getting like a touch of like what it's like"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"to actually be Bruce."
01:40:32;01:40:35;"Whereas, he was still digging into like"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"the place he came from."
01:40:37;01:40:38;"- Right."
01:40:38;01:40:40;"I mean like the Brassica is a pretty personal record"
01:40:40;01:40:42;"but he's still writing about characters on that record."
01:40:42;01:40:45;"But like it's inspired a lot by his childhood"
01:40:45;01:40:46;"and thinking about his dad."
01:40:46;01:40:49;"I mean, people think of that as a political record"
01:40:49;01:40:52;"but it is more of like a personal album, but you're right."
01:40:52;01:40:55;"I mean, I think Taylor Swift, because she's so famous"
01:40:55;01:40:58;"anytime she puts out a record, everyone is just playing"
01:40:58;01:41:02;"like the investigation game, like who she's writing about."
01:41:02;01:41:05;"There's also like a score settling aspect"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"of her songwriting."
01:41:07;01:41:11;"You know, like I'm getting revenge on you type thing"
01:41:11;01:41:15;"which is interesting with her songwriting."
01:41:15;01:41:17;"- Yeah, not really Bruce's style."
01:41:17;01:41:18;"- Not really, not necessarily."
01:41:18;01:41:20;"Yeah, at least not as like."
01:41:21;01:41:24;"If Glory Days was going back to like a hometown bar"
01:41:24;01:41:26;"and just like flexing on everybody."
01:41:26;01:41:29;"Like this guy who used to be an incredible baseball player"
01:41:29;01:41:31;"back in high school."
01:41:31;01:41:32;"And then they asked me what I was up to."
01:41:32;01:41:35;"And I said, you know what I've been up to?"
01:41:35;01:41:36;"I'm Bruce."
01:41:36;01:41:37;"- Right."
01:41:37;01:41:39;"- I just did four nights at the Spectrum."
01:41:47;01:41:52;"â™ª My head of plan was a big baseball player â™ª"
01:41:52;01:41:56;"â™ª Back in high school â™ª"
01:41:56;01:42:00;"â™ª He could throw that speedball fire â™ª"
01:42:00;01:42:04;"â™ª Make you look like a fool, boy â™ª"
01:42:04;01:42:07;"â™ª Saw him the other night at this roadside bar â™ª"
01:42:07;01:42:11;"â™ª I was walking in, he was walking out â™ª"
01:42:11;01:42:15;"â™ª We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks â™ª"
01:42:15;01:42:20;"â™ª But all we kept talking about was Glory Days â™ª"
01:42:20;01:42:25;"â™ª Well, they left passing by Glory Days â™ª"
01:42:25;01:42:27;"â™ª And the wink of a young girl's eye â™ª"
01:42:27;01:42:31;"â™ª Glory Days, Glory Days â™ª"
01:42:31;01:42:34;"- Last thing I wanna say,"
01:42:34;01:42:36;"just to take it into some TC place."
01:42:36;01:42:39;"And this is actually a thought that I'd had"
01:42:39;01:42:40;"a few months ago."
01:42:40;01:42:45;"Even though I love both Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen,"
01:42:45;01:42:48;"and as a born and raised Tri-State area resident,"
01:42:48;01:42:52;"I do kinda, I love that there are these two superstar,"
01:42:52;01:42:55;"iconic songwriters from the Tri-State area"
01:42:55;01:42:58;"who have so many things in common,"
01:42:58;01:43:00;"but also, you know,"
01:43:00;01:43:02;"Billy obviously is more of the pop dude and whatever."
01:43:02;01:43:05;"And I always, in my head,"
01:43:05;01:43:07;"'cause you know, I wasn't there for it."
01:43:07;01:43:12;"I always assumed that Allentown probably came out"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"after Born in the USA."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"I always assumed that that whole album,"
01:43:16;01:43:19;"the Nylon Curtain, 'cause it has ""Goodnight, Saigon."""
01:43:19;01:43:23;"It has Billy's Vietnam song."
01:43:23;01:43:25;"And it has Allentown, which is his like,"
01:43:25;01:43:27;"you know, kinda Reagan era,"
01:43:27;01:43:30;"like death of American industry type song."
01:43:30;01:43:34;"I always assumed that he probably was following"
01:43:34;01:43:35;"Born in the USA."
01:43:35;01:43:38;"And when I realized that this album is from September '82,"
01:43:38;01:43:38;"I felt bad."
01:43:38;01:43:39;"I was like, man, I should've given Billy"
01:43:39;01:43:43;"a little more credit that he was,"
01:43:43;01:43:44;"I mean, he still might've been influenced"
01:43:44;01:43:47;"by elements of Bruce."
01:43:47;01:43:49;"He could've been influenced by the river and darkness,"
01:43:49;01:43:50;"but I was like, you know what?"
01:43:50;01:43:53;"Dropping like a big single as a pop star"
01:43:53;01:43:56;"about a steel town in the Rust Belt"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"and then having like a big Vietnam song in '82,"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"I was like, you know, you gotta give Billy some credit."
01:44:00;01:44:03;"- Yeah, he definitely got to Vietnam before Bruce did."
01:44:03;01:44:06;"So that's score one for Billy."
01:44:06;01:44:07;"I think that the Billy Joel,"
01:44:07;01:44:12;"the Billy Joel like fighting Bruce Springsteen example"
01:44:12;01:44:15;"is ""A Matter of Trust."""
01:44:15;01:44:16;"You remember that song?"
01:44:16;01:44:18;"- Oh yeah, which is a good song."
01:44:18;01:44:21;"- It's like in the video, Billy's playing guitar."
01:44:21;01:44:22;"- Yeah, yeah, right."
01:44:22;01:44:23;"- Which is weird."
01:44:23;01:44:24;"- Wait, how does that one fight Springsteen?"
01:44:24;01:44:25;"Sorry."
01:44:25;01:44:27;"(Billy vocalizing)"
01:44:27;01:44:28;"- Just like the melody."
01:44:28;01:44:29;"(Billy vocalizing)"
01:44:29;01:44:30;"- And like at the start too, he's like,"
01:44:30;01:44:34;"â™ª A one, two, a one, two, three, four â™ª"
01:44:34;01:44:35;"It's like a very kind of Bruce-y type."
01:44:35;01:44:36;"- I see what you mean."
01:44:36;01:44:39;"- And he kinda looks like Bruce in the video a little bit."
01:44:39;01:44:41;"I feel like he's like rolled up sleeves."
01:44:41;01:44:42;"- Yes."
01:44:42;01:44:43;"- And he's playing like in a rehearsal space"
01:44:43;01:44:45;"and all these people in New York"
01:44:45;01:44:47;"are coming to see him play."
01:44:47;01:44:50;"So I always feel like, even his jaw in the video,"
01:44:50;01:44:53;"he's kind of like a Bruce type jaw action,"
01:44:53;01:44:55;"kind of grimacing a little bit."
01:44:55;01:44:57;"So I always felt like ""A Matter of Trust"""
01:44:57;01:45:00;"was Billy tipping the cap to Bruce."
01:45:00;01:45:04;"â™ª One, two, a one, two, three, four â™ª"
01:45:13;01:45:17;"â™ª Some love is just an eye of the heart â™ª"
01:45:17;01:45:20;"â™ª The core remains of what began â™ª"
01:45:20;01:45:23;"â™ª With a passionate start â™ª"
01:45:23;01:45:27;"â™ª And they may not want it to end â™ª"
01:45:27;01:45:31;"â™ª But it will, it's just a question of when â™ª"
01:45:31;01:45:35;"â™ª I've lived long enough to have learned â™ª"
01:45:35;01:45:37;"â™ª The closer you get to the fire â™ª"
01:45:37;01:45:41;"â™ª The more you get burned â™ª"
01:45:41;01:45:45;"â™ª But that won't happen to us â™ª"
01:45:45;01:45:48;"â™ª 'Cause it's always been a matter of trust â™ª"
01:45:48;01:45:50;"- I actually just wrote a thing about Billy Joel,"
01:45:50;01:45:53;"like a big column about him, like a Billy Joel list."
01:45:53;01:45:56;"- Is it your top 100 Billy Joel songs?"
01:45:56;01:45:58;"- I didn't go 100, it was like 40"
01:45:58;01:45:59;"and then I had like 10 songs that didn't go like this."
01:45:59;01:46:01;"- Oh, hell yeah, I love those."
01:46:01;01:46:04;"- So I've been recently immersed in Billy Joel"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"and I think with Billy Joel"
01:46:06;01:46:08;"that people don't give him enough credit for"
01:46:08;01:46:12;"is that like, he's like a really good mimic."
01:46:12;01:46:14;"Like he's really good at like,"
01:46:14;01:46:18;"okay, I'm gonna make a Beatles sounding song."
01:46:18;01:46:22;"I'm gonna make a song that sounds like Steely Dan."
01:46:22;01:46:24;"You know, like ""52nd Street"" is kind of like"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"there's some Steely Dan type songs on that record."
01:46:26;01:46:30;"Like ""Glass Houses"" is like, I listened to Elvis Costello."
01:46:30;01:46:32;"I can write those kinds of songs too."
01:46:32;01:46:34;"And just to bring Jake in the conversation,"
01:46:34;01:46:36;"I think that there's some parallels"
01:46:36;01:46:39;"between Billy Joel and Ween in that regard."
01:46:39;01:46:42;"And Gene Ween actually did a tour"
01:46:42;01:46:43;"where he covered Billy Joel."
01:46:43;01:46:46;"Like he did like a Billy Joel tribute show."
01:46:46;01:46:48;"- Oh yeah, man, those are like YouTubes of him"
01:46:48;01:46:51;"at Brooklyn Bowl or whatever."
01:46:51;01:46:52;"- Yeah, and he's like what in Philly?"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"- Just got an all DJ set. - He's like really good."
01:46:54;01:46:57;"- Yeah, it's like, you know, no irony,"
01:46:57;01:46:59;"just straightforward Billy Joel."
01:46:59;01:47:01;"It's like the best Billy Joel tribute band of all time."
01:47:01;01:47:04;"- Yeah, 'cause they're both like incredible musicians."
01:47:04;01:47:06;"Like I bet the same way you could sit with Billy Joel"
01:47:06;01:47:09;"and say like, play something that sounds like Ray Charles."
01:47:09;01:47:10;"He would just do it."
01:47:10;01:47:11;"Play something that sounds like Tchaikovsky,"
01:47:11;01:47:13;"he would do it in the same way with Dean Wayne."
01:47:13;01:47:14;"You're probably just like--"
01:47:14;01:47:15;"- Gene. - Oh, Gene."
01:47:15;01:47:19;"Say like some Jimmy Page. - Right."
01:47:19;01:47:20;"- George Benson, you know, Prince."
01:47:20;01:47:21;"You know, they just do it."
01:47:21;01:47:24;"They understand the language of music"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"in almost like a music school way."
01:47:26;01:47:28;"Yeah, so they're capable of doing anything."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"- And his vocals too are underrated."
01:47:29;01:47:30;"Like he can do that vocally."
01:47:30;01:47:34;"Like whenever I hear ""You May Be Right,"""
01:47:34;01:47:36;"I always think of like how his phrasing"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"is like really similar to Mick Jagger."
01:47:38;01:47:41;"Like how he says like, ""In the rain."""
01:47:41;01:47:43;"I think it's like very Mick Jagger sounding."
01:47:43;01:47:45;"And it's like a subtle thing,"
01:47:45;01:47:47;"but like, I don't know, he's like really good at that."
01:47:47;01:47:50;"Like, I don't know if you've ever seen like"
01:47:50;01:47:52;"his interviews with Howard Stern."
01:47:52;01:47:54;"He's got like a bunch of like long interviews"
01:47:54;01:47:57;"with Howard Stern where he like breaks down his songwriting."
01:47:57;01:47:58;"And it's pretty interesting."
01:47:58;01:48:01;"Like that's how I learned that"
01:48:01;01:48:02;"""It's Still Rock and Roll to Me"""
01:48:02;01:48:05;"has the same chord progression as ""Lay, Lady, Lay."""
01:48:05;01:48:07;"Talked about that."
01:48:07;01:48:10;"So now I always think of that whenever I hear that song."
01:48:10;01:48:12;"But he's really good at talking about songwriting."
01:48:12;01:48:14;"- And maybe that's what works against him too,"
01:48:14;01:48:19;"is that like, even though Bruce obviously also writes"
01:48:19;01:48:22;"from different perspectives and does research"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"and uses characters in his song,"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"there's something because you know,"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"Billy Joel is just such like a gifted mimic"
01:48:28;01:48:31;"and just like, yeah, kind of like an old school showbiz guy."
01:48:31;01:48:33;"I can do this, I can do that."
01:48:33;01:48:35;"That when you hear a song like ""Allentown,"""
01:48:35;01:48:37;"Bruce really could write a song like that"
01:48:37;01:48:39;"about a place that he's not from,"
01:48:39;01:48:43;"about people who are not exactly people from his own life,"
01:48:43;01:48:46;"but it's still maybe the audience,"
01:48:46;01:48:49;"it comes across differently or something."
01:48:49;01:48:51;"And maybe also Bruce has his world"
01:48:51;01:48:53;"that he returns to over and over again."
01:48:53;01:48:58;"I'm pretty sure ""Allentown"" is the one Rust Belt song"
01:48:58;01:49:00;"in the Billy Joel discography."
01:49:00;01:49:02;"- Yeah, my theory on Billy Joel"
01:49:02;01:49:04;"is that people looked at him as like,"
01:49:04;01:49:07;"he's just gonna do whatever it takes to get on the charts."
01:49:07;01:49:09;"So it's like, oh, you want some doo-wop songs?"
01:49:09;01:49:10;"He can write you some doo-wop songs."
01:49:10;01:49:15;"If you want like arena rock sounding songs, he can do that."
01:49:15;01:49:17;"And I actually think that's like one of his strengths,"
01:49:17;01:49:18;"that he has that versatility."
01:49:18;01:49:21;"But if you compare him to someone like Bruce,"
01:49:21;01:49:22;"like Bruce has his thing."
01:49:22;01:49:26;"And I think he has his persona, he has his sound."
01:49:26;01:49:27;"And I think for a lot of people,"
01:49:27;01:49:29;"they look at that as like, oh, he's authentic."
01:49:29;01:49:33;"He's got like, he's not, he is who he is."
01:49:33;01:49:35;"- He's got more of a point of view, yeah."
01:49:35;01:49:37;"- But even Bruce had to like work to get to that."
01:49:37;01:49:41;"Like his early records aren't like his classic era records."
01:49:41;01:49:43;"I mean, I love ""Wild In The Instant"""
01:49:43;01:49:44;"and ""The East Street Shuffle,"""
01:49:44;01:49:47;"but like that's a pretty Van Morrison sounding record."
01:49:47;01:49:50;"I mean, that's not a novel observation."
01:49:50;01:49:53;"He's taken a lot from Van on that record."
01:49:53;01:49:54;"And it's a great record,"
01:49:54;01:49:58;"but he had to find his way too over time."
01:49:58;01:50:01;"- I know a pretty little place in Southern California"
01:50:01;01:50:03;"down San Diego way."
01:50:03;01:50:06;"(laughing)"
01:50:06;01:50:07;"â™ª Spread out now, Rosie â™ª"
01:50:07;01:50:12;"â™ª Dr. Conklin, loose her mama's reins â™ª"
01:50:12;01:50:15;"â™ª You know playing blind man's love â™ª"
01:50:15;01:50:18;"â™ª Is a little baby's game â™ª"
01:50:18;01:50:21;"â™ª You pick up little dynamite â™ª"
01:50:21;01:50:24;"â™ª I'm gonna pick up little guns â™ª"
01:50:24;01:50:27;"â™ª And together we're gonna go high tonight â™ª"
01:50:27;01:50:31;"â™ª And make that highway run â™ª"
01:50:31;01:50:33;"â™ª You don't have to call me Lieutenant Rosie â™ª"
01:50:33;01:50:37;"â™ª And I don't wanna be your son â™ª"
01:50:37;01:50:39;"â™ª The only lover I'm ever gonna need â™ª"
01:50:39;01:50:43;"â™ª Just lost these little girls down the line â™ª"
01:50:43;01:50:48;"â™ª Oh, Rosie, you're a one â™ª"
01:50:48;01:50:53;"â™ª Dynamites in the milk cream, baby â™ª"
01:50:53;01:50:55;"â™ª Playing with the bats â™ª"
01:50:55;01:50:58;"â™ª Little guns downtown in front of Rover's â™ª"
01:50:58;01:51:02;"â™ª Trying out his attitude on all the cats â™ª"
01:51:02;01:51:05;"â™ª Papa's on the corner â™ª"
01:51:05;01:51:08;"â™ª Waiting for the bus â™ª"
01:51:08;01:51:11;"â™ª Mama, she's holding the window â™ª"
01:51:11;01:51:14;"â™ª Waiting up for us â™ª"
01:51:14;01:51:16;"â™ª She'll be there in that shuttle â™ª"
01:51:16;01:51:17;"â™ª The rest of us upstairs â™ª"
01:51:17;01:51:20;"â™ª 'Cause you know we ain't gonna come â™ª"
01:51:20;01:51:24;"â™ª I ain't here on business, baby â™ª"
01:51:24;01:51:27;"â™ª I'm only here for fun â™ª"
01:51:27;01:51:32;"â™ª And Rosie, you're the one â™ª"
01:51:32;01:51:36;"â™ª Roll this jumbo lighter â™ª"
01:51:36;01:51:39;"â™ª Say Rita, come sit by my fire â™ª"
01:51:39;01:51:42;"â™ª I just wanna be your lover, ain't no lie â™ª"
01:51:42;01:51:46;"â™ª Rosie, you're my strong desire â™ª"
01:51:46;01:51:47;"- All right, well, thanks so much for calling in, Steven."
01:51:47;01:51:50;"Everybody check out the book in stores now."
01:51:50;01:51:52;"Great book, there was nothing you could do."
01:51:52;01:51:53;"- Thank you."
01:51:53;01:51:55;"- I know we were kind of scattershot today,"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"but love the book."
01:51:57;01:51:58;"Couldn't recommend it more."
01:51:58;01:51:59;"- Thanks, man."
01:51:59;01:52:01;"Can I make a quick plug here too?"
01:52:01;01:52:02;"- Yeah, of course."
01:52:02;01:52:05;"- 'Cause I'm gonna be in LA on June 11th."
01:52:05;01:52:08;"I'm doing a book event at Book Soup in West Hollywood."
01:52:08;01:52:09;"- So this is a banked up."
01:52:09;01:52:10;"- Oh, it is."
01:52:10;01:52:11;"- You know what, I can basically guarantee"
01:52:11;01:52:12;"it won't come out."
01:52:12;01:52:13;"(laughing)"
01:52:13;01:52:14;"But you know what?"
01:52:14;01:52:15;"- But we'll keep this part in."
01:52:15;01:52:17;"- So everybody check out the book"
01:52:17;01:52:19;"and all the great writing."
01:52:19;01:52:22;"And let's go out on the final track on Born in the USA,"
01:52:22;01:52:23;"My Hometown."
01:52:23;01:52:26;"We'll see you next time."
01:52:26;01:52:29;"â™ª I was eight years old â™ª"
01:52:29;01:52:34;"â™ª And running with a dime in my hand â™ª"
01:52:34;01:52:40;"â™ª To the bus stop to pick up a paper from my old man â™ª"

01:53:26;01:53:33;"â™ª There was a lot of fights between the black and white â™ª"
