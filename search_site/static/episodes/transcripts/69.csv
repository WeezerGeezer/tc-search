00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, episode 69 if you can believe it. I'm here with Jake and this"
00:07;00:14;"is a very special show as we have a guest calling in a legend. That's right"
00:14;00:21;"Alanis Morissette. We'll also be talking about Tic Tacs a little more, the Richard"
00:21;00:26;"Pictures Vampire Weekend shows in Ojai and counting down the hits of 1974. This"
00:26;00:32;"is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
02:11;02:15;"Time Crisis back once again. Jake and I just rolled up to the studio there were a bunch"
02:15;02:20;"of acoustic instruments in here. Including an acoustic bass. Yeah Jake grabbed the guitar."
02:20;02:26;"I got the acoustic bass. You were just playing a pretty kind bass solo on there."
02:26;02:34;"Yeah a couple of Martin acoustic bass. Not an upright bass. I don't know what the"
02:34;02:41;"practicality of the acoustic bass is really. I mean I guess you want to do some. It's got"
02:41;02:47;"a different kind of sound. Every time I pick up a bass I always play the same songs. Like"
02:47;02:58;"Give It Away. Is that Rage? Yeah. Bomb Track. Oh the intro to Bomb Track. It'd be better"
02:58;03:14;"with a pick. And then. Wait. Do it again. This is like two dudes in their bedroom in"
03:14;03:25;"high school. 90's bedroom. And the other one. It's all like 90's. The other one I always"
03:25;03:35;"play was. Look out. Wait what is that? I don't know what that is. It's another one of the"
03:35;03:47;"black rockin beats. It's like a Chemical Brothers song. Oh man. Do you know any Chili's dude?"
03:47;03:58;"On bass? Yeah dude like some sick Flea Parts. Give It Away dude. I don't know how to do"
03:58;04:13;"the funk of it. This is a major show we got today. Yeah. Packed. This is a packed show."
04:13;04:17;"You know normally when we do this show we always like barely even talk about what's"
04:17;04:21;"gonna happen. Maybe you know in the intro but we don't talk about it here but today"
04:21;04:26;"we got a big guest calling in. Yep. Alanis Morissette. Finally getting her on the horn."
04:26;04:31;"Makes sense. She's been coming up a lot lately. She's definitely in the zeitgeist. She got"
04:31;04:35;"some shows coming up. She got a musical. We're gonna talk about that with her. But before"
04:35;04:41;"that Jake you actually dropped some of your own musical stylings recently. I did man."
04:41;04:46;"Wrote it today. That was today? Yeah. Wow. Woke up really inspired. Was thinking about"
04:46;04:52;"that sweet Chili Heat refrain from last show. And I just had it in my head. So you turned"
04:52;04:59;"it into a proper song. Poured a cup of coffee. Grabbed the guitar and panned an instant classic."
04:59;05:05;"So for people who don't remember. I actually don't even remember. Sweet Chili Heat was"
05:05;05:12;"the Canadian version. That's the Canadian version of Spicy Sweet Chili. Spicy Sweet Chili."
05:12;05:16;"Which is in the verse of the song I reference. Oh and to clarify we're talking about Doritos."
05:16;05:20;"Oh yeah. Which we are not sponsored by. People sometimes find it hard to believe that on"
05:20;05:25;"time crisis we're not sponsored. But you know what? That's how crass the world has become."
05:25;05:31;"Anytime somebody shouts something out just cause they like it. Right. People say what"
05:31;05:36;"are you sponsored by them? You gotta say that it's an ad if you're sponsored. I just wanted"
05:36;05:40;"to write a song about Doritos. Sometimes you just like stuff people. Or just want to talk"
05:40;05:46;"about it. By the way we keep it real on this show. We don't always toe the Frito-Lay corporate"
05:46;05:54;"line. Not at all. Yeah in fact Fritos suck. Lays are okay but Fritos suck. I like Frito"
05:54;05:59;"Pie maybe but just like Fritos? I don't want to eat that. That's bottom of the barrel."
05:59;06:09;"You should just hold that bass the whole show. I might hold the bass the whole time. And"
06:09;06:15;"just maybe just do some interludes here and there. Can you play any like Seinfeld style?"
06:15;06:20;"Beyo was playing that the other day at the rehearsal. He can actually play it. That's"
06:20;06:21;"tight."
07:03;07:08;"Yeah so anyway we're not sponsored by Frito-Lay. Fritos suck but we do take an interest in"
07:08;07:12;"these types of things and we're not even being complimentary about Doritos. In fact I think"
07:12;07:16;"it's confusing that they give two different names to the same chip in America and Canada."
07:16;07:22;"But anyway we were talking about how in Canada there's a Dorito called Sweet Chili Heat and"
07:22;07:26;"that's what inspired you to write this song. Yeah well last episode I just kept like singing"
07:26;07:30;"just Sweet Chili Heat. It just sounded like a song to me. Let's listen to it man. Let's"
07:30;07:33;"listen to it. This is exciting. This is a world premiere. Yeah. So we gotta use our"
07:33;07:46;"world premiere ID. (music)"
07:46;07:49;"So now this is becoming a real thing. Oh this is the second straight episode with a world"
07:49;07:52;"premiere. Yeah so this is the second straight episode with a world premiere. Time Crisis"
07:52;07:57;"is getting pretty spicy over here. So again the last episode we premiered Beyo's Sting"
07:57;08:02;"and Shaggy remix. Yep. And this one even more on brand. Our Sweet Chili Heat world premiere"
08:02;08:06;"is a song called Sweet Chili. So let's listen to that intro one more time."
08:06;08:14;"Time Crisis. This is the Time Crisis Sweet Chili Heat. Sweet Chili Heat world premiere"
08:14;08:21;"brought to you by Doritos. Sweet Chili Heat. Oh man. That's good. Maybe now we should have"
08:21;08:26;"more world premieres on this show. I think so. I'll even say this. If you write a song"
08:26;08:30;"let's try to keep them short. Maybe 45 seconds to a minute and a half. But if you write a"
08:30;08:35;"song that's about a time crisis type of thing we'll give you a world premiere. We'll give"
08:35;08:39;"you a Doritos Sweet Chili Heat. Yeah cause this song I wrote this morning is definitely"
08:39;08:47;"this is about time crisis culture and the time slot. Right. Yeah that's the way it should"
08:47;08:53;"be. This is the first entry into that field. Okay great. So here is the world premiere"
08:53;09:03;"of Jake Longstrap with Sweet Chili Heat. Oh yeah have one on me it's just a sweet sweet"
09:03;09:17;"sweet chili heat. Oh yeah have one on me it's a sweet sweet chili heat. 12 noon on a Sunday"
09:17;09:32;"Pacific Standard Time. It's three o'clock in the afternoon in the Maritimes. Grab a cold"
09:32;09:48;"one crack it bud. Maybe Medello maybe we could. Crack a bag of that spicy sweet chili. Oh"
09:48;10:01;"yeah have one on me it's a sweet sweet sweet chili heat. Oh yeah have one on me it's a"
10:01;10:11;"sweet sweet chili heat. It's a sweet sweet chili heat. Love it. Clocking in at a lean"
10:11;10:20;"minute 17. Oh hell yeah. It's a sweet sweet sweet chili heat. I feel like a band of good"
10:20;10:27;"musicians could make that sound like the Eagles. That's what I was going for I would love to"
10:27;10:34;"hear that with like a lion eyes aesthetic. You know what that sounds like big star to"
10:34;10:39;"me too. Oh yeah I can hear that. I would say a little more big star. I think the vocal"
10:39;10:43;"voice sounds great on it by the way. Thanks man. The vocal has a little bit of that Alex"
10:43;10:50;"Chilton. Yeah I can hear that. Like a more slightly 70s early power pop. Oh yeah have"
10:50;11:03;"one on me it's a sweet sweet chili heat. September girls this so much. Oh yeah have one on me."
11:03;11:10;"So in that song I like that it was kind of a nuanced allusion to time crisis. You didn't"
11:10;11:16;"drop the name but you with the time zone stuff. Right. Is the narrator of the song encouraging"
11:16;11:20;"somebody else to listen to the show. Here we go this is your logic. This is your song"
11:20;11:26;"logic. Who's singing is it you Jake. Yeah. Co-host of time crisis. Well no I don't know"
11:26;11:31;"who's singing. Fair enough. You know what I mean. Like do you have a established perspective"
11:31;11:36;"for every song you sing. Is it also a vaguely first person. I have five characters. There's"
11:36;11:41;"one called Ezra that doesn't mean it's me. Then there's Sasha Fierce Koenig. That's for"
11:41;11:47;"like the harder stuff. I don't think this is me. I think this is a friend singing a"
11:47;11:52;"song to his friend of just like dude let's crack a brew. Let's crack a bag of sweet chili"
11:52;11:59;"heat. Throw on the show. Chill out. Nice. That's what it is. It's not me. At home. Yeah"
11:59;12:05;"I guess. I don't know. We talk a lot about like who's listening to time crisis and where."
12:05;12:11;"I think you know probably a lot of people just solo earbuds in. Right. On the bus. Driving."
12:11;12:15;"Maybe their job involves driving. Maybe they're doing deliveries or something. Been there."
12:15;12:20;"Yeah maybe it's like a young Jake Longstreth delivering for Papa John's. Run and Zah. Run"
12:20;12:25;"and Zah in Portland. We got a young Jake Longstreth just taking in some time crisis but we've"
12:25;12:29;"always been interested in the communal aspect because obviously this show is about community"
12:29;12:33;"and bringing people together. So we've gotten a lot of nice emails from like couples who"
12:33;12:37;"listen together. Right. They like go for a drive on a Sunday. Especially like Sundays"
12:37;12:43;"are classic kind of like couple day. Right. So if you're coupled up. Throw on that TC."
12:43;12:47;"Throw on that TC. Yeah because I think there's an expectation. Like we're promoting our own"
12:47;12:56;"show on the show. So lame. That's the sequel to Sweet Chili Eat. It's just. Have one on"
12:56;13:03;"me. It's a Sunday. Listen to TC. Yeah that's verse two. How about like a couple."
13:03;13:06;"Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
13:06;13:22;"I like the way your sparkling earrings lay. Against your skin so brown. And I wanna sleep"
13:22;13:37;"with you in the desert tonight. With a billion stars all around. Cause I got a peaceful easy"
13:37;14:01;"feeling. And I know you won't let me down. Cause I'm already standing on the ground."
14:01;14:16;"I found out a long time ago. What a woman can do to your soul. Oh but she can't take"
14:16;14:34;"you anyway. You don't already know how to go. And I got a peaceful easy feeling. And"
14:34;14:50;"I know you won't let me down. Cause I'm already standing on the ground. My wife Hannah was"
14:50;14:55;"saying that her manager Ben drove out to Palm Springs and back last weekend and listened"
14:55;15:00;"to TC both ways. Both ways? Nice. So two full eps probably. Hell yeah. When we visualized"
15:00;15:05;"our listeners and we've talked about the communal aspect we've often visualized couples. Cause"
15:05;15:10;"Sundays is a very couple-y day. If you're coupled up Sundays there's an expectation"
15:10;15:16;"that you're gonna be with your significant other. Whether it's brunch. If you're a heathen."
15:16;15:21;"Or church. If you're religious. Or even just having a lazy Sunday in bed. Doing laundry"
15:21;15:29;"at home. Just doing some chores. Maybe cooking a pot of chili. Chili Sundays. But I also"
15:29;15:36;"wanna say that not everybody in the world is coupled up. And we do live in a very couple"
15:36;15:41;"centric society. As people have rightly pointed out from time to time. You know that's not"
15:41;15:47;"the only valid or important relationship in life. So in this song it could be a couple."
15:47;15:51;"But I also like the idea. And I don't know if this happens. If there's ever just like"
15:51;15:56;"a couple of bros. Or just any type of friends. Who are just getting together. Maybe they're"
15:56;16:00;"both single. Maybe they're not interested in a relationship at this point in their life."
16:00;16:04;"And so their Sunday is wide open. But they still love TC. And they may love the communal"
16:04;16:09;"aspect of it. So maybe they do just get together. Maybe that Saturday night late text. Hey man"
16:09;16:16;"your place or mine. For TC. How about your place? My roommate's got his cousin staying"
16:16;16:22;"in town. Alright cool man. Grab a couple bags of sweet chili heat. You know it. Then just"
16:22;16:26;"sit down on the couch and just play it off an iPhone. Just like sitting there in silence."
16:26;16:32;"Also just like a little too quiet for two people to listen to in the house. Just playing."
16:32;16:36;"Maybe play through the speakers. Maybe the song is also just about like prepping for"
16:36;16:42;"like a football game too. Like your friends are coming over. Right. Have one on me dude."
16:42;16:47;"Crack that bag of sweet sweet chili heat. Yeah because if you were throwing like a football"
16:47;16:52;"watching event and you saw. What was that like. Have one on me. Does that mean a whole"
16:52;16:59;"bag or just one chip. In my head there's some logic jumps. It's have a brew on like have"
16:59;17:04;"one on me. But then yeah then we're talking about chips. Maybe have one single serving"
17:04;17:09;"bag on me. I thought it was almost like yeah you roll over for the football game party."
17:09;17:13;"Have one on me dude. Full size family bag. And you're kind of just like poking around"
17:13;17:17;"in the kitchen. You see this bag of sweet chili heat and maybe there's some just like"
17:17;17:23;"some Fritos and lays laid out in the living room. And then you're like hey man what's"
17:23;17:27;"up with these sweet chili heat. Be like oh actually those are mine for the week. But"
17:27;17:35;"those are not part of the party. Those are mine for the week. OK. I should put those"
17:35;17:40;"away. But you know everyone's going to get really confused. No but then maybe it's like"
17:40;18:08;"You know what, man? Have one on me. I could have one sweet chili heat chip? Yes. Well, I have one on me. One chip. Have one on me. Have one on me. One chip. Have one on me. It's
sweet, sweet. I can picture it as the Eagle song, too, though. Yeah, like, really sweet."
18:08;18:16;"Sweet chili heat. Great song, and I hope it's the first of many from you and from any listeners."
18:16;18:17;"Fan base."
18:17;18:24;"Fan base, because if you send us a song, you could be our Doritos Sweet Chili Heat world"
18:24;18:25;"premiere."
18:25;18:42;"Hey, man, are these sweet chili heat for the party? Hey, man, couldn't help noticing when"
18:42;18:43;"I was out and..."
18:43;18:47;"I got nothing. I was trying to read from the perspective of the guy who found the sweet"
18:47;18:50;"chili heat in the kitchen."
18:50;19:01;"Very specific perspectives. Okay, this song is about a guy that goes to his friend's house,"
19:01;19:05;"sees a bunch of Doritos laid out, and then is told he can't have any."
19:05;19:09;"What's up, Kansas City? This next one's about..."
19:09;19:13;"There's some hard truths in this one."
19:13;19:17;"This next one's about a guy who goes to a party at his friend's house. He buys a bag"
19:17;19:22;"of chips, but it's not in the designated party snack area."
19:22;19:31;"Looking out at the road, rushing under my wheels. Looking back at the years gone by,"
19:31;19:34;"like so many sour peels."
19:34;19:41;"At 65, I was 17, living at Earth 101."
19:41;19:48;"I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on."
19:48;20:01;"Running on that deep, running blind. Running into the sun, but I'm running behind."
20:01;20:10;"Gotta do what you can just to keep your mother alive."
20:10;20:17;"Try not to confuse it with what you do to survive."
20:17;20:24;"At 69, I was 21, and I called the love of my own."
20:24;20:31;"I don't know when that road turned onto the border."
20:31;20:41;"Running on that deep, running blind. Running into the sun, but I'm running behind."
20:41;20:44;"Okay, man, I think it's time to get Lanis Morissette on the horn."
20:44;20:48;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
20:48;20:51;"[phone ringing]"
20:51;20:52;"Hello?"
20:52;20:53;"Hello."
20:53;21:02;"What are you doing, man? I'm good. How are you? Not bad! We're just wrapping up a meeting and we're gonna head up into conference room. Can I just put you on hold? Yeah.
Sweet, thank you."
21:09;21:36;"Sweet, sweet, sweet chili heat. Sweet, sweet, sweet chili heat. Sweet, sweet, sweet chili heat. Sweet, sweet, sweet chili heat. Born inside a nation, none of myself
and a cup of ambition and a sweet chili heat on all my fingertips."
21:36;21:52;"Woke up in the morning, inside a bed, and I see the chili heat in the ground in the kitchen. I want it, man, I'm begging thee. Is it sweet chili heat? Am I waiting on the bed?
Ain't that sweet chili heat? What am I--"
21:52;22:11;"This is still about the guy. Is that sweet chili heat that I found inside the kitchen? Is that sweet chili heat that I found in my friend's kitchen? Sweet chili heat that
I'm on a meditation?"
22:29;22:47;"Woke up in the morning in my kitchen, and myself a cup of ambition and a sweet chili heat. Went over to Jake's house in the morning, and I'm sitting there listening to me."
22:47;23:07;"Is that sweet chili heat that I found in my friend's kitchen? Is that sweet chili heat that I found in my friend's kitchen? Is that sweet chili heat? What am I waiting to do?"
23:07;23:25;"It's a little hard to fully come up with it on the fly, but I guess--oh, you know what would make sense? Because if the part two of the song is a kind of nine-to-five homage,
it could make sense that you find a bag of sweet chili heat in the office kitchen, and nobody's name is on it."
23:25;23:29;"Then you wail on it, and then--"
23:29;23:30;"And then an email goes out."
23:30;23:31;"Yep."
23:31;23:32;"Who ate--"
23:32;23:33;"Repercussions."
23:33;23:34;"Yeah."
23:37;23:45;"Woke up in the morning in the meditation, poured myself a cup of--that's the only line I know from it, ""poured myself a cup of ambition."""
23:45;24:00;"Poured myself a cup of ambition, and I went on and go to work. I was getting breakfast, and I was really hungry, and I got to the office, and I saw a bag of sweet chili heat."
24:00;24:16;"So I crushed that bag that I found in the office kitchen, and I crushed that bag, and I--"
24:23;24:24;"Second verse."
24:24;24:34;"In the medicine in the morning, and then I got an email from the HR department saying, ""Who ate that bag of sweet chili heat?"""
24:34;24:37;"Sort of felt bad, but really I didn't."
24:37;24:43;"Sort of felt bad, but really I didn't. No one's name was on that bag, and then I--"
24:43;24:46;"Crushed that bag of sweet chili heat."
24:46;25:01;"Got that sweet chili bag, and then I found 'em in the kitchen, and I crushed that bag in the morning, and I crushed that bag, and it's all--"
25:01;25:05;"That's really cheap. I go crazy if you let 'em--"
25:06;25:07;"What?"
25:07;25:08;"[Laughter]"
25:08;25:09;"Trying to make fun of it, eh?"
25:09;25:12;"Okay, we were just writing a song while we were waiting."
25:12;25:15;"Sweet. All right, so we're all set whenever you are."
25:15;25:16;"Great, yeah, you can just throw it on."
25:16;25:18;"They're listening for like five minutes."
25:19;25:22;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
25:22;25:25;"[Phone ringing]"
25:25;25:26;"Hi."
25:26;25:27;"Hello?"
25:27;25:28;"Hello, it's Alanis."
25:28;25:31;"Hey, Alanis, welcome to the show. This is Ezra and Jake."
25:31;25:32;"Hey."
25:32;25:33;"Hi, Ezra. How you doing?"
25:33;25:36;"First of all, it's an honor to have you on the show. Massive fans."
25:36;25:37;"Oh, thank you for having me."
25:37;25:39;"And we also want to say happy birthday."
25:39;25:41;"Aw."
25:41;25:47;"We're very excited to hear about the musical because we've recently just been kind of revisiting that album"
25:47;25:50;"and thinking about the impact it had."
25:50;25:52;"Can you tell us a little bit about the musical?"
25:52;25:53;"That's kind of what you're working on right now, right?"
25:53;25:59;"Yeah, we had the opening. We had previews for a while in Cambridge at ART, the repertory,"
25:59;26:02;"and then the opening was the 24th."
26:02;26:04;"But it was really exciting."
26:04;26:11;"To be perfectly honest, I still kind of stitch with this. This has been in the making for about eight years."
26:11;26:16;"And so it having come to fruition even at this point, and with the people,"
26:16;26:23;"so Diablo Cody writing the book, and Diane Paulus directing it, and Larbi choreographing it,"
26:23;26:27;"and just the whole team, and the cast, and the producers, and everybody,"
26:27;26:32;"it's a very surreal experience for me. My mouth is agape."
26:32;26:34;"Is every song from Jagged Little Pill in it?"
26:34;26:38;"Every song from Jagged Little Pill is in it, and then some songs that I've written over the years,"
26:38;26:42;"and then two new ones, and then some lyrics from some new ones for a new record I'm writing now."
26:42;26:46;"Oh, sick. And so we saw a little--we haven't gotten to see the show yet."
26:46;26:49;"I would love to, but I saw one little detail that we're interested in."
26:49;26:51;"The musical takes place in Connecticut?"
26:51;26:52;"Yep."
26:52;26:58;"Jake is from Connecticut, and we've often talked about how Connecticut is sometimes unfairly or fairly derided"
26:58;27:05;"as a random state, and so we were kind of excited to see Connecticut get a little shine."
27:05;27:07;"What's the story with that?"
27:07;27:10;"I didn't write the book, so it's Diablo Cody. I call her Brooke, by the way,"
27:10;27:13;"so if you hear me say Brooke, I call her by her real name."
27:13;27:18;"She came up with the Connecticut thing, and we basically brainstormed in Malibu."
27:18;27:23;"I have an office that overlooks the ocean, and we just brainstormed for 48 hours straight"
27:23;27:28;"on a whiteboard and just bandied ideas around and went down certain rabbit holes and trajectories"
27:28;27:32;"of where characters could go, where we specifically didn't want them to go."
27:32;27:37;"It was pretty harrowing and beautiful, and it was one of those cases of two plus two people in a room"
27:37;27:42;"felt like 50. It was overwhelming, and now that the musical is being formally shared,"
27:42;27:46;"it's still stressful for me a little bit, I have to be honest, because as you can imagine,"
27:46;27:52;"I'm actually sending--I'm on stage sending it out, so to be in the audience receiving it"
27:52;27:55;"is a whole head spinner for me."
27:55;27:59;"Oh, yeah, that's true. Yeah, as a musician, you never can--"
27:59;28:00;"How could you, right?"
28:00;28:02;"Yeah, you have such a different vibe."
28:02;28:06;"So after this run in Cambridge, do you know where it's going to go next"
28:06;28:10;"for everybody else who wants to see it around the country, or that's kind of TBD?"
28:10;28:14;"I think the general sense of movement is toward being in New York next year,"
28:14;28:19;"but there's no assumption about anything, and we're just keeping our heads--"
28:19;28:22;"our eyes on the prize and our heads down and just keep doing what we're doing"
28:22;28:27;"one in front of the other. But yeah, ideally it would be to share it in New York"
28:27;28:29;"and then ultimately to share it around the planet."
28:29;28:30;"Tight."
29:00;29:03;"'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket"
29:03;29:06;"And the other one is giving a high five"
29:11;29:13;"I feel drunk but I'm sober"
29:13;29:16;"I'm young and I'm underpaid"
29:16;29:20;"I'm tired but I'm working, yeah"
29:21;29:24;"I care but I'm restless"
29:24;29:26;"I'm here but I'm really gone"
29:26;29:30;"I'm wrong and I'm sorry, baby"
29:30;29:35;"And what it all comes down to"
29:35;29:41;"Is that everything's gonna be quite alright"
29:41;29:44;"'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket"
29:44;29:47;"And the other one is flicking a cigarette"
29:47;29:49;"So we've been talking about Jagged Little Pill a lot,"
29:49;29:52;"and one kind of thought that I had when we've been thinking about it--"
29:52;29:56;"it's really cool hearing about the musical and stuff"
29:56;29:58;"because it just shows how timeless those songs are."
29:58;30:01;"And, you know, that's just one of those albums that--"
30:01;30:04;"one conversation that we had, and I don't know if this is because"
30:04;30:07;"obviously we were younger in the '90s too,"
30:07;30:10;"but I feel like when you talk about that album"
30:10;30:13;"and you remind people how old you were when you wrote it"
30:13;30:16;"and when it came out, often they're like blown away."
30:16;30:19;"You were 20 or 21 when it dropped?"
30:19;30:22;"Yeah, I wrote it when I was 19 and 20,"
30:22;30:25;"and then it came out right at my 21st birthday."
30:25;30:27;"Oh, on your 21st birthday? That's wild."
30:27;30:29;"So I guess this is a question that I've had."
30:29;30:33;"This maybe gets a little heady, but I've been thinking a lot about how"
30:33;30:35;"I feel like when Jagged Little Pill came out--"
30:35;30:37;"and maybe it's because it was so successful--"
30:37;30:42;"that people didn't talk about you like you were this super young person."
30:42;30:45;"Because now--because I've also had this general feeling"
30:45;30:47;"that maybe there's this kind of extended adolescence"
30:47;30:50;"that's kind of happened in the last 20 years."
30:50;30:52;"I even noticed this at the royal wedding"
30:52;30:55;"when the priest kept talking about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle"
30:55;30:59;"and kept saying it's so nice to see two young people come together in love."
30:59;31:03;"And I was watching this like, ""Young people? She's pushing 40!"""
31:03;31:07;"And I'm not trying to be mean. I'm 34. I'm getting older too."
31:07;31:10;"But I was just kind of like--in another era it would have been laughable"
31:10;31:14;"to call somebody in their late 30s a young person getting married."
31:14;31:18;"You see a lot of these narratives that focus on how young a musician is"
31:18;31:21;"and how they should be seen through that lens and whatever."
31:21;31:23;"And then I was thinking about, well, Jagged Little Pill is probably"
31:23;31:27;"one of the greatest albums of all time that was written by a teenager."
31:27;31:30;"And how come nobody talks about it that way?"
31:30;31:34;"Well, because the thing that you're describing, you're describing ageism,"
31:34;31:38;"which is when an older person is freaked out by the new generation kicking ass"
31:38;31:40;"or jealous, straight up."
31:40;31:44;"Or you're also--oh, Arrested Development, straight up."
31:44;31:50;"So some of us are actually writing in our 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s."
31:50;31:54;"We're still--certain bands that are still on stage in their 70s,"
31:54;31:58;"they're still kind of rehashing certain dysfunctional dynamics"
31:58;32:02;"and relationships through their lyrics in the same way that they were doing"
32:02;32:04;"maybe when they were 19."
32:04;32:06;"So I think it's a combination of that."
32:06;32:09;"But perhaps in my case--and I have no idea, I'm just guessing--"
32:09;32:12;"I think my age was almost irrelevant in a way"
32:12;32:15;"because I was just writing about my human experience."
32:15;32:18;"Maybe it didn't chronologize me or something. I have no idea."
32:18;32:22;"It's a very common narrative these days, and I'm not even knocking it."
32:22;32:25;"It's just like something changed where if an album was written by a 15-year-old,"
32:25;32:29;"16-year-old, 19-, 25-year-old, there is often this narrative about"
32:29;32:33;"a new young voice coming through, whereas I don't know if it just speaks"
32:33;32:36;"to the quality of the album that there was--"
32:36;32:38;"There wasn't a lot of reference to that, right?"
32:38;32:42;"And to the point where people now assume that I'm in my 60s."
32:42;32:46;"It's like, ""Oh no, I'm still in my early 40s."""
32:46;32:52;"So yeah, for me, it is--you can connote that there's extra experience,"
32:52;32:56;"but that's not always the case, especially in Hollywood where so many of us"
32:56;33:00;"are given a green light to stay regressed for the rest of our lives here."
33:00;33:03;"Playing out some teenage dynamics when we're in our 50s"
33:03;33:06;"is kind of informal for Hollywood in a way."
33:06;33:10;"Yeah, and I think it's interesting because there are people--"
33:10;33:13;"the albums that they would write--literally the album that might come out"
33:13;33:16;"when they're 21 might have a lot of references to high school."
33:16;33:19;"There could be songs about the prom or graduation."
33:19;33:23;"That is something that's interesting that you wrote an album"
33:23;33:26;"that at that young age-- - Went the other direction."
33:26;33:30;"- Fully connected with people truly of all ages."
33:30;33:34;"It's kind of amazing to think--and I think that's partially why"
33:34;33:37;"people still talk about that album so much today--is that it's not like,"
33:37;33:40;"""Oh yeah, that was this kind of high school young person's album."""
33:40;33:43;"You really hit on these kind of universal themes."
33:43;33:46;"When you were writing it at the time, did you feel like you were--"
33:46;33:49;"I know obviously that wasn't the beginning of your career at all,"
33:49;33:52;"but did you have this feeling of, ""I'm a very young person"
33:52;33:54;"stepping into this world,"" or were you just always kind of like,"
33:54;33:56;"""I write what I write""?"
33:56;33:59;"I don't think I was putting as much conscious thought into it"
33:59;34:01;"as that might give me credit for."
34:01;34:04;"I started a record company when I was 10 because I'd always loved"
34:04;34:07;"writing songs, and the first songs that I wrote as a younger person"
34:07;34:11;"were little precursors to my eventual full-blown love addiction."
34:11;34:14;"But I think what was happening then was it was a little more fictional"
34:14;34:16;"for what might be obvious reasons."
34:16;34:19;"And then as I grew older and I had a record deal with MCA Records"
34:19;34:23;"in my teen years, and they wanted--there was a record company"
34:23;34:26;"that wanted to release it around the planet internationally,"
34:26;34:28;"and I wasn't ready yet. I didn't want to leave high school."
34:28;34:34;"So basically by the time I was 18 or 19, I had been dropped by MCA Records,"
34:34;34:38;"with them having viewed my career as having been done by then."
34:38;34:40;"They're like, ""Oh, she's done."""
34:40;34:43;"I started writing songs that heaven forbid didn't rhyme"
34:43;34:47;"and were very stream-of-consciousness and autobiographical"
34:47;34:50;"and just this wild narrative, and I think they all just thought,"
34:50;34:52;"""Oh, this is the end for you."""
34:52;34:55;"And in my own mind, I just thought, ""Oh, how fantastic that I get"
34:55;34:59;"to shed this snakeskin."" And geographically speaking,"
34:59;35:02;"I went from Canada to Los Angeles, and no one had any sense at all"
35:02;35:05;"of who I was. Some knew that I could hit certain notes vocally,"
35:05;35:08;"but nobody knew anything about what I was up to."
35:08;35:12;"So I felt that beautiful kind of insulation vacuum thing"
35:12;35:15;"that maybe not for all artists, but certainly for me,"
35:15;35:17;"I really benefit from feeling completely off the radar"
35:17;35:21;"when I'm creating something, almost forgotten would be ideal."
35:21;35:24;"So--and I remember saying to myself that I wouldn't stop writing"
35:24;35:26;"until I loved it with all of my heart."
35:26;35:30;"And in terms of the sort of egoic pie-in-the-sky visions"
35:30;35:33;"of what could be possible for record sales specifically,"
35:33;35:36;"I just thought, you know, on a really, really good day,"
35:36;35:39;"at best, this record will sell maybe, you know,"
35:39;35:41;"fingers crossed, 100,000 copies."
35:41;35:45;"So I knew I loved it, and I knew I was really proud to share it,"
35:45;35:47;"but I had no idea of what was to come."
35:47;35:50;"And in retrospect, I just think it was this wave"
35:50;35:53;"that was, you know, accumulating, and the crest was getting"
35:53;35:56;"super white and fluffy, and I just volunteered."
35:56;35:59;"I just put my hand up and said, ""I'll ride this surfboard, man."
35:59;36:02;"I'll get my head chopped off. Put me in the room."""
36:02;36:05;"And so the movement was happening with or without me,"
36:05;36:09;"but I just stood up and volunteered and said, ""I'll do it."""
36:09;36:11;"And that was that little juncture, that sort of, like,"
36:11;36:15;"geisty, wild tailspin of a moment."
36:15;36:21;"# I recommend getting your heart jumbled up to anyone"
36:21;36:26;"# Yeah, no"
36:26;36:34;"# I recommend walking around naked in your living room"
36:34;36:37;"# Yeah"
36:37;36:43;"# Swallow it down, what a jagged little pill"
36:43;36:48;"# It feels so good, swim in your stomach"
36:48;36:54;"# Wait until the dust settles"
36:54;36:57;"# You live, you learn"
36:57;37:00;"# You love, you learn"
37:00;37:02;"# You cry, you learn"
37:02;37:05;"# You lose, you learn"
37:05;37:08;"# You bleed, you learn"
37:08;37:12;"# You scream, you learn"
37:12;37:15;"# You scream, you learn"
37:15;37:17;"# You learn"
37:17;37:24;"# I recommend biting off more than you can chew to anyone"
37:24;37:28;"# I certainly do"
37:28;37:36;"# I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time"
37:36;37:40;"# Ooh, feel free"
37:40;37:45;"# Hold it down, the caution marks you from the wind"
37:45;37:51;"# Hold it up, take the reins"
37:51;37:57;"# You weigh in and see when the smoke clears"
37:57;37:59;"# You live, you learn"
37:59;38:02;"# You love, you learn"
38:02;38:05;"# You cry, you learn"
38:05;38:08;"# You lose, you learn"
38:08;38:11;"# You bleed, you learn"
38:11;38:17;"# You scream, you learn"
38:17;38:22;"We were also reflecting recently about the, um,"
38:22;38:24;"what are your memories of Radiohead opening for you?"
38:24;38:26;"'Cause that was right in that era, right?"
38:26;38:29;"That was like at the peak of touring, ""Jagged Little Pill""?"
38:29;38:33;"Yeah, that was, um, I just remember listening to so many new songs"
38:33;38:36;"because I, you know, I was the girl that listened to meditation music, you know?"
38:36;38:41;"I was super highly sensitive and easily affected by even the tiniest of energies."
38:41;38:45;"So people often thought that I'd be blasting, you know, anthrax in my hotel room"
38:45;38:48;"all my days off, and I was just like quite the opposite, actually."
38:48;38:51;"So I didn't listen to a lot of music, and when ""Jagged Little Pill"" came out,"
38:51;38:53;"everyone kept, you know, giving, doing the initial records"
38:53;38:57;"and giving me every record that was out there, and the Radiohead records."
38:57;39:00;"Then Taylor Hawkins handed it to me, and he said, ""We,"" he said,"
39:00;39:05;"""Let's listen to this together at the back of the bus on our way to God knows where we were traveling from."""
39:05;39:09;"And I just listened to it front to bottom, and I was completely blown away"
39:09;39:14;"at all the subtleties and the mix and the, you know, the magic that is and was them."
39:14;39:18;"And then when it came time to try to figure out who to play with in America"
39:18;39:21;"on our American tour, a third name was either thrown into the hat or,"
39:21;39:26;"I don't know which version it was, but it was just super fun for me as an artist"
39:26;39:29;"to share the stage with people whom I bowed down to, you know?"
39:29;39:32;"One of Jake's favorite of your songs is ""Thank You,"" and we were listening to that,"
39:32;39:36;"and as we were revisiting that song, we were kind of like, ""This reminds us of Radiohead in some ways."""
39:36;39:38;"And we were like, ""Oh, maybe there's a slight Radiohead influence."""
39:38;39:40;"And then we thought about it later, and we were like,"
39:40;39:42;"""Maybe Radiohead was actually influenced by you."""
39:42;39:44;"That's what we started to think."
39:44;39:45;"[laughs]"
39:45;39:46;"Let's not get crazy."
39:46;39:49;"Well, who knows? I mean, they were the opener."
39:49;39:51;"Yeah, yeah, hilarious."
39:51;39:55;"No, but they, you know, I always felt, as an artist, you know, there's certain sort of"
39:55;39:59;"factions of self that were invisible in certain contexts."
39:59;40:02;"My academic part was invisible in the rock and roll world,"
40:02;40:05;"and my vocalist was invisible in certain other areas."
40:05;40:11;"But when I was on tour, I always felt like Tommy Ork was fascinated with my evolution as an artist."
40:11;40:16;"And I remember him having said somewhere that he was excited about what songs were coming down,"
40:16;40:18;"you know, were coming in the future."
40:18;40:21;"And I remember just really being touched by that, because so many people were, you know,"
40:21;40:24;"""She's gonna be bankable, scalable,"" you know?"
40:24;40:27;"And there were so many other orientations and projections."
40:27;40:33;"And just for him to say something that simple, like, ""Yeah, I look forward to beholding her evolution"
40:33;40:36;"in his own way,"" his having said that, it's just like an outbreath for me."
40:36;40:41;"Like, finally, someone just cares about my evolution and not about what it means externally."
40:41;40:42;"What a relief."
40:42;40:43;"All right, yeah."
40:43;40:44;"That's awesome."
40:44;40:48;"And that makes total sense, especially at that moment, when you basically, like, released, like,"
40:48;40:49;"the thriller of the '90s."
40:49;40:50;"Yeah."
40:50;40:55;"People, I'm sure, so many people around you were just all of, their concern was--"
40:55;40:57;"It was just so frothing."
40:57;41:03;"Yeah, how do we whip this thing up in this album to be just as big as possible?"
41:03;41:07;"And so it's cool for somebody to be a fan of you and to say in the moment, like, ""Yeah,"
41:07;41:09;"and where's this gonna lead to?"""
41:09;41:10;"Yeah."
41:10;41:16;"And that also gave me, in some weird way, like, in a brotherly way, it gave me permission to"
41:16;41:20;"do whatever I wanted to write next without, you know, without the daunting pressure of having to"
41:20;41:23;"somehow repeat as though I could do that anyway."
41:23;41:24;"I don't even think it's possible."
41:24;41:25;"Yeah."
41:25;41:29;"I mean, records like that for the whole world come across so infrequently."
41:29;41:35;"I had no choice but to hear you."
41:35;41:41;"You stated your case time and again."
41:41;41:47;"I thought about it."
41:47;41:53;"You treat me like I'm a princess."
41:53;41:59;"I'm not used to lying naked."
41:59;42:03;"You ask how my day was."
42:03;42:09;"You've already won me over in spite of me."
42:09;42:15;"Don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet."
42:15;42:19;"And don't be surprised if I love you."
42:19;42:25;"For all that you are, I couldn't help it."
42:25;42:29;"It's all your fault."
42:29;42:35;"Your love is thick, and it swallowed me whole."
42:35;42:41;"You're so much braver than I gave you credit for."
42:41;42:45;"That's not lip service."
42:45;42:51;"You've already won me over in spite of me."
42:51;42:57;"And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet."
42:57;43:01;"And don't be surprised if I love you."
43:01;43:07;"For all that you are, I couldn't help it."
43:07;43:11;"It's all your fault."
43:11;43:17;"You are the bearer of unconditional things."
43:17;43:23;"You held your breath and the door for me."
43:23;43:27;"Thanks for your patience."
43:27;43:31;"This is super random, but I've always wondered this."
43:31;43:37;"Do you ever think about the fact that quite a few of the biggest albums of the 90s were made by Canadian women?"
43:37;43:41;"And I specifically think about you, Shania, and Celine Dion."
43:41;43:43;"Canada's just not that big of a country."
43:43;43:47;"Gigantic, tens of millions selling albums."
43:47;43:51;"People from a country a tenth the size of the US. Is there anything to that?"
43:51;43:55;"I really think it's the fluoride in the water up there."
43:55;43:59;"I've had cheeky thoughts about why that is."
43:59;44:03;"It's so cold in the winters there that all we can do is dialogue."
44:03;44:07;"There's a perspective and a lens that we look through."
44:07;44:11;"If I could be crassly broad-strokey, we're a very dialogical culture."
44:11;44:17;"I think about people like Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell and Neil Young and Katie Lang."
44:17;44:21;"I think we really enjoy painting with our words and telling stories."
44:21;44:25;"And we're an emotive bunch."
44:25;44:29;"We're a feisty bunch with a lot of opinions."
44:29;44:33;"Underneath all of it is a big, shiny little heart trying to stay warm in the winter."
44:33;44:37;"I have no idea is my answer."
44:37;44:39;"No, that's a decent hypothesis."
44:39;44:43;"One thing that's come up on this show quite a bit is moving from cold places to warm places."
44:43;44:45;"That's just a classic time crisis theme."
44:45;44:49;"So you were talking about moving from Canada to LA."
44:49;44:53;"Do you ever need to go cold up?"
44:53;44:55;"Yeah, I need to cold it up sometimes."
44:55;45:03;"Snow snowing is one of the most exhausting athletic experiences of my whole life."
45:03;45:05;"It's so exhausting."
45:05;45:07;"I miss snow snowing and skiing."
45:07;45:09;"I skied a lot as a kid."
45:09;45:13;"We lived in Germany when I was younger, so we skied all those really fun European mountains."
45:13;45:15;"I miss the snow a lot, and I need it."
45:15;45:19;"My kids have both been born in LA and California here."
45:19;45:24;"So when I talk about snow with them, there's a look in my eye that they want to know more."
45:24;45:26;"So I look forward to snowball fights."
45:26;45:29;"To show them the ancestral homeland?"
45:29;45:31;"Yes, keep that in their bones somehow."
45:31;45:32;"The motherland."
45:32;45:37;"Do you think of Jagged Little Pill as a warm weather album, being that you made it in LA?"
45:37;45:40;"Or were you bringing a lot of cold weather emotion to it?"
45:40;45:47;"Well, I think when I was writing Jagged Little Pill, I was basically five days a week, we'd write a song a day."
45:47;45:52;"And then on the weekends, I would rollerblade from Santa Monica Pier to Manhattan Beach and back."
45:52;45:57;"So I didn't have a ton of friends. I had maybe one, maybe two friendly acquaintances."
45:57;46:01;"So I basically just exercised my face off on the weekends."
46:01;46:04;"And then I would come in during the week with Glenn Ballard at his studio,"
46:04;46:07;"and we would just write a song a day and eat our chopped salad."
46:07;46:10;"And it was just such an epic routine for me."
46:10;46:15;"It was something I really held on to, especially with having moved to LA and not having known a soul."
46:15;46:19;"We were just talking about also how great and iconic the videos from that album were."
46:19;46:26;"And this is such a small thing, but I just always love that it's cold in the ironic video,"
46:26;46:28;"that there's hats and scarves and stuff."
46:28;46:32;"I don't know, and maybe that's why I think of it as such a cold weather album."
46:32;46:35;"But you could have made that video in a convertible driving down Sunset."
46:35;46:37;"But I don't know, I always love the--"
46:37;46:38;"It was in Brooklyn."
46:38;46:40;"Oh, it was in Brooklyn."
46:40;46:45;"It was in Brooklyn. And yeah, snow is just such a part of my whole jam."
46:45;46:47;"So I'm always trying to figure out how to get snow."
46:47;46:51;"Even in the musical, I was like, ""Can we get snow?"""
46:51;46:54;"Snow, snow, snow everywhere in photo shoots."
46:54;46:56;"I'm constantly trying to chase the snow."
46:56;46:59;"Even the salt flats in the ""You Oughta Know"" video, it's just this whiteness."
46:59;47:00;"I love it."
47:00;47:03;"Oh yeah, another iconic location. Great video."
47:03;47:05;"Thanks so much for calling in."
47:05;47:08;"It's truly an honor to have you on the show."
47:08;47:10;"I hope we get a chance to see the musical."
47:10;47:15;"And you're playing Arroyo Seco coming up here in Southern California."
47:15;47:19;"Thank you for having me. I'm excited to have chatted with you guys."
47:19;47:22;"Thanks for the kind of interview you do. It's so unique."
47:22;47:25;"We don't interview a lot of people, so we don't--"
47:25;47:29;"It's the kind I love, too. It's basically a conversation."
47:29;47:31;"Thanks so much."
47:31;47:32;"Yeah, thank you."
47:32;47:33;"Have a good one."
47:33;47:34;"You too. Have a good one. Bye."
47:34;47:35;"Bye."
47:35;47:43;"I want you to know that I'm happy for you."
47:43;47:51;"I wish nothing but the best for you both."
47:51;47:54;"I know the version of me."
47:54;47:56;"Is she perverted like me?"
47:56;48:01;"Would she go down on you in a theater?"
48:01;48:03;"Does she speak Araquanine?"
48:03;48:05;"And would she have your baby?"
48:05;48:10;"I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother."
48:10;48:17;"'Cause the love that you gave me we made wasn't able to make it up for you to really open wide."
48:17;48:19;"No."
48:19;48:24;"And every time you speak her name does she know how you told me it helped me?"
48:24;48:28;"Until you died, until you died, but you're still alive."
48:28;48:37;"And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away."
48:37;48:46;"It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you did to me."
48:46;48:49;"You, you, you ought to know."
48:49;48:54;"You seem very well."
48:54;48:58;"Things look peaceful."
48:58;49:02;"I'm not quite as well."
49:02;49:07;"I thought you should know."
49:07;49:11;"Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity?"
49:11;49:16;"I hate to find you in the middle of dinner."
49:16;49:18;"There was a slap in the face."
49:18;49:20;"How quickly I was replaced."
49:20;49:25;"And are you thinking of me when you fuck her?"
49:25;49:34;"'Cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able to make it up for you to be open wide."
49:34;49:39;"And every time you speak her name does she know how you told me it helped me?"
49:39;49:43;"Until you died, until you died, but you're still alive."
49:43;49:52;"And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away."
49:52;50:01;"It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you did to me."
50:01;50:04;"You, you, you ought to know."
50:14;50:41;"[vocalizing]"
50:41;50:47;"'Cause I hope that you're laid in a bed that was made and I'm not gonna fade as soon as you prove your lies."
50:47;50:50;"And you know it."
50:50;50:56;"Every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back I hope you feel it."
50:56;50:58;"Can you feel it?"
50:58;51:07;"Well, I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away."
51:07;51:16;"It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you did to me."
51:16;51:19;"You, you, you ought to know."
51:19;51:28;"I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away."
51:28;51:37;"It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you did to me."
51:37;51:41;"You, you, you ought to know."
51:41;51:47;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
51:47;51:50;"Wow, I'm buzzing off that Alanis call."
51:50;51:51;"That was a great call."
51:51;51:54;"Man, she's so cool. I'm really walking on air."
51:54;52:00;"You know what's funny? When she first got on the phone I suddenly tensed up because I was like, ""Is it Alanis or Alanis?"""
52:00;52:01;"Oh, wow."
52:01;52:07;"It's like a name that you know so well but then suddenly you just get like in your head about it and then she said Alanis."
52:07;52:09;"Wow, you're operating on another level."
52:09;52:12;"I like that she has such like a kind vibe."
52:12;52:18;"Like, you can tell like she's somebody who's like spent time thinking about the meaning of life, what it means to be a human being."
52:18;52:19;"Mindfulness."
52:19;52:21;"Mindfulness. Yeah, she's cool."
52:21;52:23;"Should've asked her about the dead."
52:23;52:24;"Oh, man. That would've been sick."
52:24;52:25;"Missed opportunity."
52:25;52:26;"Just at the very end."
52:26;52:28;"By the way, Alanis, like The Grateful Dead?"
52:28;52:29;"What's your favorite period of the dead?"
52:29;52:31;"Yeah."
52:31;52:33;"Spring '90."
52:33;52:35;"Also the Alanis Alanis thing."
52:35;52:38;"I've been like starting to take some singing lessons."
52:38;52:39;"Really?"
52:39;52:42;"Because losing your voice on tour is the worst thing ever."
52:42;52:43;"It's happened a couple times."
52:43;52:52;"So, you know, I always like kind of as we start looking towards the future of touring I try to get together and people give you warm-ups you can do and ways of thinking
about singing and things like that."
52:52;52:55;"So it's a way to preserve the skill set in the long run."
52:55;53:00;"Yeah, because you might sometimes do something on the record to like make a point."
53:00;53:02;"But if you do that night after night you might do."
53:02;53:05;"Man, I was just reading about SZA."
53:05;53:11;"She's been talking publicly about having like some real intense vocal issues from touring a lot the past year."
53:11;53:13;"And I'm sure she'll be fine."
53:13;53:14;"But that's just like heavy."
53:14;53:17;"It's like, you know, when you're a singer, like that's your thing."
53:17;53:18;"Yeah."
53:18;53:20;"It's a terrible feeling when you lose your voice or when you can't perform."
53:20;53:26;"So anyway, I'm always on the lookout for ways that I can make my life less stressful, especially having not sang very much in the past years."
53:26;53:32;"But so much of what they talk about sometimes when you're going over stuff is vowel sound."
53:32;53:37;"And as we've talked about on the show, people often say that I have like a weird ass accent."
53:37;53:43;"So there'll be times when they're like, we'll go back and listen to some early Vampire Weekend songs, which would like sound crazy to me."
53:43;53:45;"And we're like working on some word."
53:45;53:50;"And I was like showing her the song Kids Don't Stand a Chance or something."
53:50;53:54;"And there's some word, like the word pure."
53:54;53:56;"And probably back then I'd be like, ""We got it."""
53:56;53:58;"Like I'll do that kind of thing."
53:58;54:00;"And she was just like, ""No, but we're going to say pure."""
54:00;54:01;"And I was like, ""OK."""
54:01;54:03;"I was like, ""Whatever you tell me."""
54:03;54:05;"And then we were getting to some word."
54:05;54:07;"I sang it one way and she was like, ""Come on, how's it pronounced?"""
54:07;54:12;"And I was like, ""Hmm, this is how I would pronounce it."""
54:12;54:18;"Whatever word it was, like devastating or what are the words in that song?"
54:18;54:20;"France. I just say stuff weird."
54:20;54:26;"And it's funny because it makes you think about vowel sounds and Alanis, Alanis."
54:26;54:28;"So you'll be singing the song slightly differently now?"
54:28;54:29;"Well, it's interesting."
54:29;54:34;"Sometimes if you change the vowel sound, I haven't actually tried this stuff out."
54:34;54:36;"I was like showing her one of our new songs."
54:36;54:40;"And I was like, ""This one's going to be like a little intense to sing live."""
54:40;54:42;"I want to get up to it."
54:42;54:46;"And she was just showing me certain ways to kind of tweak the pronunciation."
54:46;54:49;"And then I did it and I listened back to the recording."
54:49;54:51;"You couldn't even tell the difference."
54:51;54:56;"I've always wondered that too, if people with certain accents are naturally slightly better singers"
54:56;55:00;"because the vowel sounds lend themselves more to singing."
55:00;55:01;"The British."
55:01;55:03;"Yeah, I always thought about a Cockney accent like, ""Oi."""
55:03;55:06;"Because apparently ""Oi"" is kind of like an easier vowel."
55:06;55:10;"But when I think about my accent or like New Jersey, it's like the worst."
55:10;55:14;"Yeah, it's real like flat, angular."
55:14;55:22;"[singing]"
55:22;55:24;"I think English people might have it a little easier."
55:24;55:25;"Yeah."
55:25;55:30;"If I was doing my real accent, [singing]"
55:30;55:32;"Yeah, so there's just times where we're like we're working on [bleep]"
55:32;55:35;"and she's a great teacher and she'll be like, ""How is the word pronounced?"""
55:35;55:37;"And I'll just be like, ""I don't know."""
55:37;55:40;"I know how I would say it. I know how that person might say it."
55:40;55:44;"I'll get too postmodern. I'll be like, ""No such thing as pronunciation."""
55:44;55:46;"But I just want to know what's the easiest way."
55:46;55:53;"[singing]"
55:53;56:13;"[singing]"
56:27;56:34;"You criticize the practice by murdering the plants"
56:34;56:41;"Ignoring all the history, denying them romance"
56:41;56:48;"The pinstripe men of mourning are coming for to dance"
56:48;56:54;"Forty million dollars, the kids don't stand a chance"
56:54;56:58;"So speaking of live, we got to talk about these shows we got coming up."
56:58;57:00;"Yeah, man, big announcement this past week."
57:00;57:03;"Well, a couple of things happened. One, Vampire Weekend got back on Instagram."
57:03;57:04;"That's huge."
57:04;57:06;"Got a couple pieces of press."
57:06;57:08;"I saw that. That is headline worthy."
57:08;57:11;"Well, I'm glad they're spreading the word, man. It's a big deal to us."
57:11;57:12;"Running that gram."
57:12;57:15;"Sometimes you get a headline and you're like, ""It's a big deal for us."""
57:15;57:17;"I don't know what everybody else is going to think about that,"
57:17;57:22;"but I've totally been in this kind of weird place where the album is so close to being done."
57:22;57:23;"It's basically done."
57:23;57:28;"But even when an album's done, you got to make sure you like the mixing and mastering and stuff."
57:28;57:31;"And we got festivals this summer, and we're doing all the--"
57:31;57:34;"It's really coming together, but it's funny."
57:34;57:38;"As you start kind of awakening these things--"
57:38;57:41;"Our Instagram account had two pictures of Steve Buscemi from five years ago."
57:41;57:42;"That was it."
57:42;57:43;"Really?"
57:43;57:45;"And they were like, ""You got to start using this again."""
57:45;57:48;"Everybody, the promoters, they were like, ""You guys got to start using this."""
57:48;57:49;"And I was like, ""All right."""
57:49;57:53;"So I just posted a few random pictures, and people were like, ""What are these cryptic images?"""
57:53;57:57;"Just give us some-- I was like, ""Nothing cryptic. We're a band."
57:57;58:01;"Obviously, we got an album coming soon. We're finishing it. We got some shows booked."
58:01;58:02;"We're getting started. That's all."""
58:02;58:03;"Getting warmed up here."
58:03;58:04;"We're just getting warmed up."
58:04;58:09;"It's like I kind of do just want to be more straightforward because I don't like all this weird cryptic [expletive]"
58:09;58:11;"kind of like, ""Why are we playing shows?"""
58:11;58:13;"Because the album's almost done."
58:13;58:14;"""Why are you playing festivals?"""
58:14;58:20;"Because that's a good place where you can get a nice check and go play for a [expletive] load of people."
58:20;58:22;"""Why are you playing small shows before that?"""
58:22;58:24;"So that we're ready for the festivals."
58:24;58:25;"""When's the album going to come out?"""
58:25;58:32;"When it's done, obviously we book these shows with the expectation that the album would be done in or around that era,"
58:32;58:33;"that amount of time."
58:33;58:35;"That's what's happening. It's all straightforward."
58:35;58:40;"""Why are you posting a picture of a Columbia fleece on Instagram?"""
58:40;58:44;"Because that's what I was wearing when they told me I got to get the Instagram popping."
58:44;58:45;"So I took a little picture of it."
58:45;58:47;"And the album is called Columbia Fleece."
58:47;58:49;"And the album's called Columbia Fleece."
58:50;58:52;"Texting messages, I don't know the number"
58:52;58:55;"Flexing on these lexuses, every bone and muscle"
58:55;58:58;"Steady taking shots, never hurting 'em"
58:58;59:00;"Even then, y'all don't worry nothing"
59:00;59:04;"And I'd like to give a shout-out to my nigga with the gang plan"
59:04;59:07;"And shout-outs to my nigga with escape plans"
59:07;59:10;"20 bands, rain dance"
59:10;59:13;"We can either rain check or we can make plans"
59:13;59:16;"Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, can't let's rock and roll this"
59:16;59:20;"Timeless dope, lock stopping, smoking barrels locked and loaded"
59:20;59:22;"Diamonds glowing, chalk climbing on 'em"
59:22;59:25;"You think I'm jumping out the window, I got 'em open"
59:25;59:28;"Line around the corner, line 'em up, the block ain't over"
59:28;59:31;"Sometimes I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus"
59:31;59:34;"My shade, Dior, my pants, Velour"
59:34;59:37;"Create, explore, expand, concord"
59:37;59:40;"I came, I saw, I came, I saw"
59:40;59:43;"I praise the Lord and break the law"
59:43;59:46;"I take what's mine and take some more"
59:46;59:49;"It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours"
59:49;59:52;"I came, I saw, I came, I saw"
59:52;59:55;"I praise the Lord and break the law"
59:55;59:58;"I take what's mine and take some more"
59:58;01:00:01;"It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours"
01:00:01;01:00:04;"But anyway, so these shows that we're talking about are"
01:00:04;01:00:07;"Richard Pictures, which is Jake's Grateful Dead cover band"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"Formerly known as DickPix"
01:00:09;01:00:12;"And Vampire Weekend doing two shows"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"Not two nights, two shows"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"Saturday night and Sunday morning"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"In Ojai, California"
01:00:18;01:00:19;"At the Libby Bowl"
01:00:19;01:00:22;"And um, I'm very excited about these shows"
01:00:22;01:00:25;"This will be the first time, well you and I have shared the stage before"
01:00:25;01:00:28;"We opened for Bernie Sanders in Washington Square Park"
01:00:28;01:00:29;"That's right"
01:00:29;01:00:30;"We did Dirty Projectors together"
01:00:30;01:00:34;"But this will be the first time that Richard Pictures and Vampire Weekend have shared the stage"
01:00:34;01:00:35;"It's huge, I'm thrilled"
01:00:35;01:00:38;"It's huge, I mean, I also feel like"
01:00:38;01:00:41;"It's funny because like last week we announced the show"
01:00:41;01:00:44;"And you could see, I also forget because it's been a while"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"That like our fans are from all over the place"
01:00:46;01:00:47;"So some people would be like"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"That's cool, I live in Argentina"
01:00:49;01:00:52;"And it's like, oh yeah, this is a fairly regional show"
01:00:52;01:00:53;"Oh this is very local"
01:00:53;01:00:54;"It's very local"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"It's not even in LA"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"It's 90 minutes outside of LA"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"But Ojai's the right vibe"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"This is a kind, first step"
01:01:02;01:01:03;"Ojai's a kind vibe"
01:01:03;01:01:04;"It's a kind first step"
01:01:04;01:01:07;"Ojai and the entire Ventura County, Santa Paula"
01:01:07;01:01:11;"All those places recently survived one of the worst fires in California history"
01:01:11;01:01:14;"Even just the fact that the community survived that comeback"
01:01:14;01:01:19;"It feels like the perfect place to do a kind of a chill, quiet relaunch"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"So anyway, maybe there's some tickets left"
01:01:21;01:01:22;"You can look it up"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"Very reasonably priced"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"What are they running?"
01:01:25;01:01:26;"In at around 20 bucks"
01:01:26;01:01:27;"Okay"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"We made the decision that we're like"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"These shows are not about making money"
01:01:31;01:01:32;"We just want to make sure that anybody"
01:01:32;01:01:35;"That like the real heads who want to see the show can come"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"That's very Fugazi of you"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"Right, what they used to do, five dollars?"
01:01:39;01:01:40;"Five dollars"
01:01:40;01:01:42;"At some point they must have changed"
01:01:42;01:01:45;"I feel like I saw them in like '98 or something"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"At like a real professional rock venue"
01:01:47;01:01:49;"And I think it was more than five dollars"
01:01:49;01:01:50;"Inflation"
01:01:50;01:01:51;"All good"
01:01:51;01:01:52;"Yeah, it's gonna be great"
01:01:52;01:01:54;"Saturday night, June 16th"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"And then Sunday morning"
01:01:56;01:01:57;"Yeah"
01:01:57;01:01:58;"11am?"
01:01:58;01:02:01;"Yeah, you guys are hitting the stage at 11am on Sunday"
01:02:01;01:02:02;"Okay, great"
01:02:02;01:02:05;"Well, The Dead, you know, did a lot of daytime, like weekend shows"
01:02:05;01:02:06;"Oh yeah, no"
01:02:06;01:02:07;"It's perfect"
01:02:07;01:02:08;"That's part of the thought that I had"
01:02:08;01:02:09;"'Cause you know like"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"When you're a young band"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"And you play in festivals"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"At first they might be throwing you on"
01:02:15;01:02:16;"1, 2pm"
01:02:16;01:02:19;"Even more brutally, sometimes like 11am"
01:02:19;01:02:22;"It's like, somebody's gotta kick off that main stage"
01:02:22;01:02:23;"Oh my"
01:02:23;01:02:24;"I even remember"
01:02:24;01:02:27;"It was just like, earnest, like really heavy music"
01:02:27;01:02:28;"Yeah"
01:02:28;01:02:29;"At like 11am"
01:02:29;01:02:30;"It doesn't work for everybody"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"But, so you always wanna play at night"
01:02:32;01:02:33;"And you're really excited about it"
01:02:33;01:02:34;"But then you get to the place"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"And you're more or less playing at night all the time"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"And there's a part of me that's like, you know what?"
01:02:38;01:02:41;"I remember like, chill early Vampire Weekend shows"
01:02:41;01:02:42;"We're just playing during the day"
01:02:42;01:02:44;"Our music works during the day"
01:02:44;01:02:45;"Totally"
01:02:45;01:02:46;"We can do both"
01:02:46;01:02:49;"So, that's why I didn't wanna do"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"Saturday night and Sunday night"
01:02:51;01:02:53;"And also it's Father's Day weekend"
01:02:53;01:02:54;"Right"
01:02:54;01:02:55;"So we gotta start grillin'"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"After Sunday afternoon"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"The whole thing will be wrapped up by 2pm"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"Yeah, straight to the grill"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"I might even wear the apron on stage"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"Nice"
01:03:04;01:03:05;"With the tongs"
01:03:05;01:03:06;"Bathing suit under"
01:03:06;01:03:07;"And a bathing suit under"
01:03:07;01:03:10;"'Cause we gotta start grillin' ASAP"
01:03:10;01:03:12;"Vampire Weekend Richard Pictures"
01:03:12;01:03:13;"Father's Day BBQ"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"It's gonna be a hell of an event"
01:03:15;01:03:17;"I hope that families come too"
01:03:17;01:03:18;"Yeah"
01:03:18;01:03:20;"I wanna see some fathers and sons"
01:03:20;01:03:21;"Mothers and daughters"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"Fathers and daughters"
01:03:23;01:03:24;"I have a few friends bringing their kids"
01:03:24;01:03:25;"I just wanna see families"
01:03:25;01:03:26;"Yeah"
01:03:26;01:03:27;"I think that's gonna be the vibe"
01:03:27;01:03:28;"That'll be cool"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"It'll be a good vibe"
01:03:30;01:03:32;"I think there's a farmer's market in walking distance"
01:03:32;01:03:33;"Great"
01:03:33;01:03:36;"If that 8 minute Cape Cod feels going on a little too long"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"Pop over to the farmer's market"
01:03:38;01:03:39;"Buy some produce"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"[Laughs]"
01:03:41;01:03:42;"Come back"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"Oh, they're still in it"
01:03:44;01:03:45;"Oh yeah"
01:03:45;01:03:48;"I can't stay much longer"
01:03:48;01:03:53;"My dear Melinda, the sun is getting high"
01:03:53;01:03:57;"I can't help you with your trouble"
01:03:57;01:04:01;"If you won't help with mine"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"I gotta get down"
01:04:05;01:04:12;"I gotta get down to, to mine"
01:04:55;01:04:59;"You keep me up just one more night"
01:04:59;01:05:03;"I can't sleep here no more"
01:05:03;01:05:07;"Middleman clock says quarter to eight"
01:05:07;01:05:12;"You kept me up till the morn"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"I gotta get down"
01:05:16;01:05:22;"I can't work there no more"
01:06:01;01:06:05;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
01:06:05;01:06:07;"Richard Pichard's gotta come on stage at Vampire Weekend at some point"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"Oh yeah, we should talk about that maybe off air"
01:06:09;01:06:10;"Yeah, maybe off air"
01:06:10;01:06:11;"Maybe off air"
01:06:11;01:06:15;"We should do like a closing kind of like Last Waltz style jam"
01:06:15;01:06:18;"I think everybody's gonna expect that we'd bring you guys on for, to do an 8 minute Cape Cod"
01:06:18;01:06:19;"But I wanna"
01:06:19;01:06:20;"That's strong"
01:06:20;01:06:21;"I wanna do something else"
01:06:21;01:06:22;"Okay"
01:06:22;01:06:23;"I've got some ideas"
01:06:23;01:06:24;"Okay, great"
01:06:24;01:06:25;"We'll talk about it on air"
01:06:25;01:06:26;"So anyway, oh Peter Rabbit"
01:06:26;01:06:27;"[Laughter]"
01:06:27;01:06:28;"Oh, I forgot about that idea"
01:06:28;01:06:30;"12 minute Peter Rabbit"
01:06:30;01:06:34;"For people who don't remember, I wrote a song for James Corden, Peter Rabbit"
01:06:34;01:06:37;"We are gonna be working in some deep cuts for sure"
01:06:37;01:06:38;"That's tight"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"12 minute Peter Rabbit, it's hilarious"
01:06:40;01:06:44;"Lot of poor man's payin' a five dollar bill"
01:06:44;01:06:48;"Keeps him happy all the time"
01:06:48;01:06:52;"Some other fellas pay nothing at all"
01:06:52;01:06:56;"And you can hear him cry"
01:06:56;01:07:00;"Can I go buddy, can I go down"
01:07:00;01:07:04;"Take your shift at the mine"
01:07:04;01:07:08;"Gotta get down to the Gumballin' Mine"
01:07:08;01:07:14;"That's where I mainly spend my time"
01:07:14;01:07:18;"Make good money, five dollars a day"
01:07:18;01:07:26;"Maybe tomorrow I might move away"
01:07:26;01:07:54;"[Guitar solo]"
01:07:54;01:08:01;"Lot of poor man got the Gumballin' blues"
01:08:01;01:08:05;"He can't win for losin'"
01:08:05;01:08:09;"Lot of poor man got to go bloody mad"
01:08:09;01:08:13;"Just to pay his human dues"
01:08:13;01:08:18;"I don't know now, I just don't know"
01:08:18;01:08:22;"If I'm going back again"
01:08:22;01:08:26;"I don't know now, I just don't know"
01:08:26;01:08:30;"If I'm going back again"
01:08:30;01:08:34;"I don't know now, I just don't know"
01:08:34;01:08:38;"If I'm going back again"
01:08:38;01:08:42;"So we're talking about the Peter Rabbit song that I wrote for the movie"
01:08:42;01:08:46;"Which they used my demo, that's kind of the last I heard about it"
01:08:46;01:08:50;"And then like two months later, I come across this"
01:08:50;01:08:54;"Which is a music video and recording of the song"
01:08:54;01:08:58;"By a Brazilian pop group called Rouge"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"Wow"
01:09:04;01:09:06;"You see the video?"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"Oh yeah, I'm seeing it now"
01:09:08;01:09:12;"Oh wow, this is high production value"
01:09:12;01:09:16;"I guess they made this to promote the movie in Brazil"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"Sony did"
01:09:18;01:09:20;"Yeah"
01:09:24;01:09:52;"And"
01:09:52;01:09:54;"I guess there's also like a Japanese version."
01:09:54;01:09:57;"They just send instrumental to people."
01:09:57;01:09:59;"Sounds good."
01:09:59;01:10:07;"Yeah, it sounds good in Portuguese."
01:10:07;01:10:19;"Alright, you get the idea."
01:10:19;01:10:21;"It's a good song."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"Even better in 12 minutes."
01:10:22;01:10:23;"Playing that live would be tight."
01:10:23;01:10:25;"Maybe I'll do the Rouge version."
01:10:25;01:10:28;"Heads only would just be like..."
01:10:28;01:10:29;"Just blown away."
01:10:29;01:10:33;"Like when you see a band and they play like a really deep cut."
01:10:33;01:10:35;"Oh, this dude."
01:10:35;01:10:38;"It's been funny as we've been kind of like getting ready."
01:10:38;01:10:45;"Because you know, the funny thing is, is like, before you even start learning the new album,"
01:10:45;01:10:47;"you have to make sure you know all the old too, right?"
01:10:47;01:10:51;"So it's like an interesting moment when you're kind of like starting to practice again to"
01:10:51;01:10:53;"reflect on all your old songs."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"I mean, like, which ones are fun to play?"
01:10:54;01:10:57;"Which ones could we improve on that we never like nail live?"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"And then you start to like look at it."
01:10:58;01:11:04;"And I was like, if you count the first three albums, plus deep cuts, and some kind of like"
01:11:04;01:11:08;"extended Vampire Weekend family songs, you're getting well over 40 songs in the catalog."
01:11:08;01:11:11;"And you throw in the new album covers, we could probably..."
01:11:11;01:11:18;"I think we could do people when we announced the Ohai show, a few people on Instagram were"
01:11:18;01:11:23;"like, is this the Twix?"
01:11:23;01:11:24;"Did we talk about this on Time Crisis?"
01:11:24;01:11:25;"I don't know."
01:11:25;01:11:30;"We talked about how Phish did the Baker's Dozen where they did 13 songs, no repeats."
01:11:30;01:11:36;"And we talked about how we could do a Twix sponsored two for series where we do two shows,"
01:11:36;01:11:37;"no repeats."
01:11:37;01:11:38;"Right."
01:11:38;01:11:42;"And we're almost by the time the next album comes out, we'll be able to do three."
01:11:42;01:11:44;"Oh, like 20 songs a show?"
01:11:44;01:11:45;"Roughly."
01:11:45;01:11:46;"Okay."
01:11:46;01:11:47;"So maybe a few covers."
01:11:47;01:11:49;"Especially if you're doing a 12 minute Peter Rabbit."
01:11:49;01:11:50;"Oh yeah."
01:11:50;01:11:52;"You're looking at like a two and a half hour show."
01:11:52;01:11:55;"Show three opens with a 12 minute Peter Rabbit."
01:11:55;01:11:56;"Love it."
01:11:56;01:12:01;"I just solo for five minutes before I even come in with the vocals."
01:12:01;01:12:05;"Life's nice on a sunny day."
01:12:05;01:12:08;"Or do like a real down tempo one."
01:12:08;01:12:11;"But anyway, in Ohai, we're definitely going to be switching up the set list significantly."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"I've already been brainstorming."
01:12:13;01:12:14;"Great."
01:12:14;01:12:16;"I'll have you know Richard Pictures is doing no repeats as well."
01:12:16;01:12:17;"Oh, you're doing no repeats in Ohai?"
01:12:17;01:12:18;"Yeah, dude."
01:12:18;01:12:19;"Two separate sets."
01:12:19;01:12:20;"Okay."
01:12:20;01:12:21;"I'm not saying we're doing no repeats, but..."
01:12:21;01:12:23;"Well, we're also not playing as long as you are."
01:12:23;01:12:27;"Plus, we're playing the music of the Grateful Dead."
01:12:27;01:12:31;"There's a vast catalog."
01:12:31;01:12:32;"That's true."
01:12:32;01:12:37;"And we were like, if we're doing these two opening slots, it's conceptually strong as"
01:12:37;01:12:40;"well as fun to do no repeats."
01:12:40;01:12:42;"You're standing on the shoulders of giants."
01:12:42;01:12:43;"Yep."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"You're doing your thing though."
01:12:44;01:12:48;"I mean, the one way that I think about it too is like, rather than get all up in my"
01:12:48;01:12:51;"head about like, oh, no repeats."
01:12:51;01:12:55;"You know, what's interesting is that also why I'm glad we're not doing two night shows."
01:12:55;01:12:58;"Saturday night and Sunday morning are two very distinct vibes."
01:12:58;01:12:59;"Yep."
01:12:59;01:13:00;"So you can think about it that way."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"So rather than be like, well, what songs, you know, it's like, well, whatever the first"
01:13:03;01:13:06;"three songs should be on a Saturday night."
01:13:06;01:13:07;"Right."
01:13:07;01:13:12;"Versus the next morning, Vampire Weekend hitting the stage, broad daylight, farmer's market,"
01:13:12;01:13:13;"children playing."
01:13:13;01:13:14;"That's your opener."
01:13:14;01:13:15;"Yeah."
01:13:15;01:13:16;"A man selling ice cream."
01:13:16;01:13:17;"All these things that happen."
01:13:17;01:13:19;"Then yeah, it's a different vibe."
01:13:19;01:13:20;"It's a different vibe."
01:13:20;01:13:24;"So anyway, we had a rehearsal last night and we were having that same discussion."
01:13:24;01:13:28;"We're like, okay, Saturday night show, Sunday morning show."
01:13:28;01:13:29;"What's a good opener for Sunday morning?"
01:13:29;01:13:30;"I don't know."
01:13:30;01:13:33;"I could see like bird song on Sunday during the day."
01:13:33;01:13:34;"You might get it."
01:13:34;01:13:35;"Really?"
01:13:35;01:13:36;"You might be."
01:13:36;01:13:37;"I'm not saying that has to be the opener."
01:13:38;01:13:42;"Nah, it's a little, yeah."
01:13:42;01:13:45;"Maybe a dark star."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"That could go night or day actually."
01:13:47;01:13:48;"Yeah."
01:13:48;01:13:51;"The Grateful Dead also, interestingly, their music is versatile."

01:14:56;01:14:58;"do you know the term of these restaurant business?"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"Soft opening?"
01:15:00;01:15:01;"- Yeah, I've heard that term."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"- I look at these shows as kind of a soft opening."
01:15:03;01:15:04;"- Sure."
01:15:04;01:15:06;"- But anyway, I do think these are special shows."
01:15:06;01:15:08;"If it's not sold out, come."
01:15:08;01:15:09;"If it is sold out,"
01:15:09;01:15:12;"we'll definitely be doing more (beep) like this."
01:15:12;01:15:14;"Also, I saw a couple people being like,"
01:15:14;01:15:16;"""Yo, I live in the UK."
01:15:16;01:15:17;"""I would love to see Catch Richard Pictures"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"""and Vampire Weekend any chance"
01:15:19;01:15:20;"""you're bringing them to Europe."""
01:15:20;01:15:22;"And I was like, ""Let's see if we can make that work."""
01:15:22;01:15:24;"(laughing)"
01:15:24;01:15:27;"Richard Pictures, live in London."
01:15:27;01:15:30;"- A semi-professional Grateful Dead cover band."
01:15:30;01:15:32;"(laughing)"
01:15:32;01:15:35;"- Easily top five in LA."
01:15:35;01:15:36;"- Yeah, okay."
01:15:36;01:15:37;"I feel that."
01:15:37;01:15:39;"- Okay, well anyway, so that's enough about the Ojai shows."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"We'll let you know how they go."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"We talked a little bit the other day"
01:15:43;01:15:47;"about the Tic Tac travesty, I would say."
01:15:47;01:15:48;"- Right."
01:15:48;01:15:49;"- For people who don't remember,"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"Tic Tacs are loaded with sugar,"
01:15:51;01:15:55;"but because they call the serving size of Tic Tacs"
01:15:55;01:15:58;"one Tic Tac, one capsule,"
01:15:58;01:16:01;"and each capsule has less than five grams of sugar,"
01:16:01;01:16:03;"they're allowed to claim on the label"
01:16:03;01:16:05;"that each serving has zero sugar."
01:16:05;01:16:06;"It's some weird rule"
01:16:06;01:16:09;"that if you're less than five, you can round down."
01:16:09;01:16:11;"Whereas if you look at the ingredients of Tic Tacs,"
01:16:11;01:16:15;"the number one ingredient is, of course, sugar."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"Tic Tacs are loaded with sugar,"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"but they can kind of play both ways."
01:16:18;01:16:21;"So anyway, we got an email from a fellow named Guillermo."
01:16:21;01:16:24;"- Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
01:16:24;01:16:27;"- He emailed us and said, ""Hey, gents."
01:16:27;01:16:29;"""I got this email back from someone I know at Ferrero."""
01:16:29;01:16:32;"As we also pointed out the other day,"
01:16:32;01:16:35;"Tic Tac is owned by Ferrero, the Italian company."
01:16:35;01:16:36;"Tic Tacs are Italian."
01:16:36;01:16:38;"He said, ""Not sure how important it is for them, but maybe."""
01:16:38;01:16:42;"So this guy Guillermo emailed a guy named Giovanni"
01:16:42;01:16:46;"who works for Ferrero, and he said, ""Hello, Giovanni."
01:16:46;01:16:47;"""Hope all is well."
01:16:47;01:16:48;"""How are things?"""
01:16:48;01:16:51;"Just passing along a bit of negative press."
01:16:51;01:16:53;"I heard about Ferrero this weekend, in case it's helpful."
01:16:53;01:16:54;"- Uh-oh."
01:16:54;01:16:55;"- I was listening to a radio show"
01:16:55;01:16:57;"on Apple Music this weekend."
01:16:57;01:16:59;"It's kind of like a podcast."
01:16:59;01:17:00;"Okay, fair enough."
01:17:00;01:17:02;"It is kind of like a podcast."
01:17:02;01:17:04;"It's called Time Crisis, and it's hosted by Ezra Koenig,"
01:17:04;01:17:07;"the singer of a popular band called Vampire Weekend."
01:17:07;01:17:09;"They often talk about food culture and advertising,"
01:17:09;01:17:11;"and on this episode, they spent a good amount of time"
01:17:11;01:17:14;"on Tic Tacs and its advertised zero sugar content,"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"something maybe you think about."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"In any case, it wasn't positive,"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"and they asked if anyone listening from Tic Tac"
01:17:20;01:17:21;"to respond to them."
01:17:21;01:17:24;"I assume no one at Tic Tac/Ferrero would have heard it,"
01:17:24;01:17:26;"(laughs)"
01:17:26;01:17:27;"since the audience isn't huge."
01:17:27;01:17:29;"How do you know, Guillermo?"
01:17:29;01:17:30;"Well, okay, Guillermo, I appreciate the email,"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"but how do you know our audience isn't huge?"
01:17:32;01:17:35;"They have about 10,000 Twitter followers"
01:17:35;01:17:36;"at Time Crisis 2000."
01:17:36;01:17:38;"That's not too shabby."
01:17:38;01:17:38;"That's not too shabby."
01:17:38;01:17:41;"We put a lot of work in to get that up."
01:17:41;01:17:43;"But passing it along, in case it's something"
01:17:43;01:17:45;"that Ferrero would want to respond to,"
01:17:45;01:17:46;"you can find the show on Apple Music,"
01:17:46;01:17:47;"and they have an email as well."
01:17:47;01:17:48;"Hope this is helpful."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"Then Giovanni wrote back to Guillermo,"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"""Thank you very much for the heads up."
01:17:51;01:17:53;"""I will pass this on to my Tic Tac colleagues."""
01:17:53;01:17:57;"So we have reason to believe that over the past couple weeks"
01:17:57;01:17:59;"some of the Tic Tac division of Ferrero"
01:17:59;01:18:02;"may be heard about that negative press."
01:18:02;01:18:03;"Some of the higher ups."
01:18:03;01:18:06;"So thank you, Guillermo, for passing that along,"
01:18:06;01:18:07;"and I would like a response."
01:18:07;01:18:10;"Now that we know that people at Tic Tac"
01:18:10;01:18:15;"are aware of the controversy, I would like a response."
01:18:15;01:18:16;"And if anybody else has any other channels"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"to get into Tic Tac."
01:18:18;01:18:21;"- Hey, listen, man, if your American FDA"
01:18:21;01:18:25;"allows you to round down, those are the rules."
01:18:25;01:18:27;"That's what they'll come back with."
01:18:27;01:18:29;"- Excuse me, gentlemen."
01:18:29;01:18:34;"Ferrero did not create the disgusting culture of your FDA."
01:18:35;01:18:38;"- I love your sugar consumption and your obesity."
01:18:38;01:18:38;"I don't know what I'm doing."
01:18:38;01:18:40;"- Yeah, it's like some vaguely,"
01:18:40;01:18:43;"it's like a very like upper crust Italian."
01:18:43;01:18:46;"In Italy, we sell many products full of,"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"oh, this is definitely not Italian, whatever."
01:18:48;01:18:49;"- Oh, um."
01:18:49;01:18:50;"- We sell many products full of sugar,"
01:18:50;01:18:54;"and yet our obesity rate is far below yours."
01:18:54;01:18:58;"We merely play by the rules of your so-called democracy."
01:18:58;01:18:59;"- Almost going Russian there."
01:18:59;01:19:01;"- Yeah, now it's Russian."
01:19:01;01:19:02;"Here in Italy, we do not,"
01:19:02;01:19:05;"we do not believe it is our purview"
01:19:05;01:19:10;"to change the laws of your country."
01:19:10;01:19:12;"We in Italy do not round down."
01:19:12;01:19:16;"The disgusting legacy of American imperialism"
01:19:16;01:19:19;"is a stain on all of you."
01:19:19;01:19:24;"To direct this animosity towards the humble Tic Tac"
01:19:24;01:19:24;"is shameful."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"- Division of Ferrero."
01:19:26;01:19:27;"- Division. (laughs)"
01:19:27;01:19:30;"To direct this animosity at the humble Tic Tac"
01:19:30;01:19:31;"is shameful."
01:19:31;01:19:34;"- Division of Ferrero is absolutely shameful."
01:19:34;01:19:35;"It's a little more Spanish, I think."
01:19:35;01:19:38;"- I'll say this, though, and I think I tweeted this."
01:19:38;01:19:41;"I usually have a tin of Altoids in my car,"
01:19:41;01:19:43;"and the next day I looked at it,"
01:19:43;01:19:46;"and it's three Altoids per serving."
01:19:46;01:19:47;"- And an Altoid's bigger than a Tic Tac."
01:19:47;01:19:49;"- So Altoids is keeping it real."
01:19:49;01:19:51;"- Yeah, the average--"
01:19:51;01:19:52;"- Shout out to Altoids."
01:19:52;01:19:54;"- Because some people are gonna have one Altoid."
01:19:54;01:19:56;"Some people, that's one end of the spectrum."
01:19:56;01:19:58;"- That's a serving, one is a serving."
01:19:58;01:20:03;"- And an Altoid is so much meatier than a Tic Tac."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"- It's like probably 2.5 Tic Tacs."
01:20:05;01:20:07;"- Average serving size for a Tic Tac,"
01:20:07;01:20:10;"I would accept two, but it's really more like three or four."
01:20:10;01:20:11;"- Yep."
01:20:11;01:20:13;"- And Altoids is keeping it real."
01:20:13;01:20:16;"If you find our competitors at Altoids"
01:20:16;01:20:23;"to be so much more ethical,"
01:20:23;01:20:28;"by all means, indulge in that chalky,"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"disgusting English mint."
01:20:30;01:20:34;"But when you want a small, smooth capsule,"
01:20:34;01:20:39;"you will come to Tic Tac regardless of our sugar content."
01:20:39;01:20:42;"- I mean, he's kind of right,"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"pretending that my terrible impression was a real person."
01:20:44;01:20:45;"He's got a point."
01:20:45;01:20:47;"- We just did his job for him."
01:20:47;01:20:48;"- We just did his point."
01:20:48;01:20:49;"Yeah, it's true."
01:20:52;01:20:56;"(singing in foreign language)"
01:21:05;01:21:11;"(singing in foreign language)"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"- I think it's time to get in the top five."
01:21:42;01:21:47;"- It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:21:47;01:21:50;"- So this week on the top five,"
01:21:50;01:21:53;"we're comparing the top five songs on iTunes currently"
01:21:53;01:21:56;"to the top five Billboard hits of 1974."
01:21:56;01:21:57;"Why 1974?"
01:21:57;01:22:00;"- That was the year that Alanis was born."
01:22:00;01:22:01;"- That's right, Alanis."
01:22:01;01:22:04;"The Queen Alanis Morissette was born in 1974."
01:22:04;01:22:08;"- She just had her birthday, so she is 44."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"- 44."
01:22:09;01:22:11;"- A mere two years older than Kanye."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"- Well, no, four years."
01:22:13;01:22:14;"Kanye's 77."
01:22:14;01:22:15;"- Oh, he's 77."
01:22:15;01:22:16;"- He's my year, dude."
01:22:16;01:22:17;"- Okay."
01:22:17;01:22:18;"- I'm older than Kanye."
01:22:18;01:22:20;"- They still could have gone to high school together."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"- Yeah, sure."
01:22:21;01:22:22;"- Five years younger than Jay-Z."
01:22:22;01:22:23;"- Interesting."
01:22:23;01:22:25;"- She got started early, dropping classics."
01:22:25;01:22:28;"The number five song this week in 1974"
01:22:28;01:22:31;"is Marvin Hamlisch from the soundtrack to ""The Sting."""
01:22:31;01:22:32;"- Oh, great movie."
01:22:32;01:22:33;"- I never saw it."
01:22:33;01:22:37;"What's it, it's about old timey pool sharks?"
01:22:37;01:22:38;"- Card sharks."
01:22:38;01:22:39;"- Card sharks with Paul Newman?"
01:22:39;01:22:41;"- Yeah, and Robert Redford."
01:22:41;01:22:43;"- So this is ""The Entertainer,"""
01:22:43;01:22:45;"which I guess is the famous, what's his name?"
01:22:45;01:22:46;"- Scott Joplin."
01:22:46;01:22:48;"- Scott Joplin, old timey piano."
01:22:48;01:22:51;"So this was actually made it on the Billboard charts"
01:22:51;01:22:52;"back then."
01:22:52;01:22:54;"(piano music)"
01:22:54;01:23:01;"- But this was a re-record?"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"By Marvin?"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"- Marvin Hamlisch."
01:23:05;01:23:06;"- Oh, this song, okay."
01:23:06;01:23:08;"(piano music)"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"That's funny, this was a, wow, okay."
01:23:10;01:23:14;"- I guess the movie kind of reintroduced this song"
01:23:14;01:23:15;"into the public consciousness."
01:23:15;01:23:18;"- It's honestly worth watching that movie."
01:23:18;01:23:19;"It's a great movie."
01:23:19;01:23:20;"- I'll check it out."
01:23:20;01:23:26;"The movie won the Academy Award for best picture,"
01:23:26;01:23:29;"best director, and best original screenplay."
01:23:29;01:23:29;"- That's interesting."
01:23:29;01:23:32;"It's a very lighthearted, it's sort of like"
01:23:32;01:23:35;"the same tone as ""Ocean's Eleven."""
01:23:35;01:23:36;"- Really?"
01:23:36;01:23:39;"- A bunch of movie stars in their prime"
01:23:39;01:23:42;"having fun making a caper movie."
01:23:42;01:23:44;"It has a real comedic edge."
01:23:44;01:23:46;"- I mean, the song definitely has."
01:23:46;01:23:48;"- But can you imagine a movie like that?"
01:23:48;01:23:52;"Even being nominated for an Oscar today?"
01:23:52;01:23:53;"It's cool that it won."
01:23:53;01:23:58;"(imitates trumpet)"
01:23:58;01:24:02;"- Number five on the charts, that's pretty wild."
01:24:02;01:24:04;"I mean, it's an iconic piece of music."
01:24:04;01:24:06;"- Early summer of '74."
01:24:06;01:24:08;"(imitates trumpet)"
01:24:08;01:24:10;"- Yeah, I mean, were they playing that on the radio"
01:24:10;01:24:12;"or this was just people walking right out of the movie"
01:24:12;01:24:15;"and being like, ""Oh, let me get this single."""
01:24:15;01:24:16;"- By the seven inch."
01:24:16;01:24:18;"- Yeah, they're like kids."
01:24:18;01:24:20;"It's like hanging out in their room listening to that."
01:24:20;01:24:21;"- Probably on the radio too, but it would seem"
01:24:21;01:24:24;"like really out of sync with the rest of the radio."
01:24:24;01:24:27;"- Well, for instance, the number five song right now"
01:24:27;01:24:30;"on the iTunes charts, slightly different."
01:24:30;01:24:31;"Imagine Dragons."
01:24:31;01:24:34;"- They're hanging tough."
01:24:34;01:24:35;"- They're the biggest band in the world."
01:24:35;01:24:38;"Like, say what you will, but these guys are hit makers"
01:24:38;01:24:40;"and they're crushing it."
01:24:40;01:24:46;"- Do these guys ever play like those festivals,"
01:24:46;01:24:49;"like Coachella or, you know, I don't know."
01:24:49;01:24:51;"I mean, they're too big for like Lollapalooza"
01:24:51;01:24:53;"or Pitchfork probably, right?"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"What about like Reading Festival in England or whatever?"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"- I don't think you're gonna see them at Pitchfork,"
01:24:57;01:24:58;"but I don't know."
01:24:58;01:25:02;"I mean, they might be so big that playing festivals"
01:25:02;01:25:03;"is like barely worth it for them."
01:25:03;01:25:06;"- Like Beyonce played Coachella, right?"
01:25:06;01:25:08;"- Yeah. - And she did."
01:25:08;01:25:10;"- No, Coachella's definitely leaning more mainstream lately."
01:25:10;01:25:12;"I don't know."
01:25:12;01:25:13;"I don't know if you'd see Imagine Dragons."
01:25:13;01:25:14;"I don't think you'd see them at Coachella."
01:25:14;01:25:16;"Yeah, right. - Bonnaroo."
01:25:16;01:25:19;"- I'm sure they do festivals somewhere, but they're so big."
01:25:19;01:25:21;"They might just be doing their own kind of like,"
01:25:21;01:25:22;"I wonder if they do stadiums."
01:25:22;01:25:23;"- Okay, here we go."
01:25:23;01:25:25;"Upcoming festivals for Imagine Dragons."
01:25:25;01:25:28;"Summerfest 2018, Milwaukee, Wisconsin."
01:25:30;01:25:34;"FM4 Frequency Festival in Austria."
01:25:34;01:25:37;"And then some other deep, like Zurich."
01:25:37;01:25:39;"Lollapalooza Berlin."
01:25:39;01:25:41;"- Okay, that's tight."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"- All right."
01:25:42;01:25:43;"- Yeah, so they're on their own wave."
01:25:43;01:25:46;"- Lost Lake Festival, Phoenix, Arizona."
01:25:46;01:25:48;"- Should we drive out for that?"
01:25:48;01:25:49;"- TC Road Trip."
01:25:49;01:25:50;"- All right."
01:25:50;01:25:53;"Number four song in 1974, The Stylistics,"
01:25:53;01:25:54;"You Make Me Feel Brand New."
01:25:54;01:25:56;"- Oh, dude, this song is great."

01:29:49;01:29:52;"- And also 'cause you're allowed to like (beep) on Vegas."

01:30:28;01:30:30;"- It was a great show, but one thing I was gonna say"
01:30:30;01:30:32;"is that there was this moment where he,"
01:30:32;01:30:33;"and he was like very funny and personable"
01:30:33;01:30:36;"and telling stories and just kind of being himself,"

01:30:47;01:30:48;"And I'm sure it's one of those things"

01:48:53;01:48:55;"Kings of Leon came out maybe a couple years after,"

01:49:08;01:49:09;"Really?"

01:49:35;01:49:36;"Okay, before we even listen to this,"
01:49:36;01:49:38;"I want to explain what it says here."
01:49:38;01:49:41;"Ray Stevens is an American comedian and country singer-songwriter."
01:49:41;01:49:43;"He's considered a novelty artist."
01:49:43;01:49:47;"He always wrote original songs that were based on cultural trends,"
01:49:47;01:49:49;"and this song, ""The Streak,"""
01:49:49;01:49:54;"is a response to the cultural phenomenon of streaking in the early '70s,"

01:49:56;01:49:58;"That was the high-water mark for streaking?"
01:49:58;01:50:00;"I guess--well, I guess--I mean, this is after the song came out,"
01:50:00;01:50:04;"but at the 1974 Academy Awards, Robert Opel streaked."
01:50:04;01:50:06;"Wait, so does that mean run naked across the stage?"
01:50:06;01:50:09;"I think that's all it means, streaking is running naked."
01:50:09;01:50:10;"[crowd murmuring]"

01:50:20;01:50:21;"Yeah, I did."
01:50:21;01:50:23;"I was standing over there by the tomatoes,"
01:50:23;01:50:25;"and here he come, running through the pole beans,"
01:50:25;01:50:28;"through the fruits and vegetables, naked as a jaybird."

01:51:05;01:51:07;"If there's an audience to be found,"

01:51:18;01:51:19;"Yeah, I did."
01:51:19;01:51:22;"I was just in here getting my cars checked,"
01:51:22;01:51:24;"and he just appeared out of the traffic."

01:51:27;01:51:29;"I've never heard this in my life."
01:51:29;01:51:31;"I've heard of Ray Stevens."

01:51:38;01:51:43;"Flash, the rock star in front of the shop was sold."
01:51:43;01:51:47;"I feel like we talked about novelty songs last week."
01:51:47;01:51:49;"Right, felt like there weren't as many lately."

01:51:58;01:52:01;"All right, the Ray Stevens with the streak."
01:52:01;01:52:05;"It's so funny to think of streaking as a hot phenomenon."
01:52:05;01:52:06;"What the hell?"
01:52:06;01:52:09;"Like at baseball games and stuff, people would be like--"
