00:00;00:12;"Time Crisis 2017. Today marks the first time crisis in the era of the new president. We"
00:12;00:17;"won't be talking about him too much, but we will be talking with Bart Elmore, author of"
00:17;00:24;"Citizen Coke, The Making of Coca-Cola Capitalism. We'll be talking about the new film, The Founder,"
00:24;00:28;"plus digging a little deeper into the connection between McDonald's and Walt Disney. This is"
00:28;00:36;"Time Crisis with Ezra King. B-B-B-B-Beats 1."
00:37;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:43;00:50;"The war I felt, the war beneath All my rightful chances"
00:50;00:57;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:57;01:04;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the boss had to go"
01:04;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:15;01:20;"Even only they"
01:20;01:25;"Time Crisis 2017. Can you believe it?"
01:25;01:28;"Sort of. Sort of."
01:28;01:53;"Back in LA, I'm here with Jake. This is the first episode of 2017, which also means it's the first episode of the Trump presidency. Plenty to talk about there, but we know
that the true TC heads have been waiting a long time for us to get back in the mix, so we want to start you off with some real time crisis type stuff."
01:53;01:59;"So, not only am I joined by Jake, we also got Seinfeld 2000 back in the mix. What's up, Seinfeld 2000?"
01:59;02:00;"Hey, what's up?"
02:00;02:09;"First off, I put you in charge of running the Time Crisis Twitter account, Time Crisis 2000. I haven't been keeping a close eye on it. How's it been going?"
02:09;02:15;"It's fully viral. We got almost 2,500 Twitter followers, which is almost as many as you have."
02:15;02:16;"Well, I-"
02:16;02:17;"It's twice as many as me."
02:17;02:18;"Really?"
02:18;02:19;"Three times the amount."
02:19;02:20;"You got over a thousand?"
02:20;02:21;"No."
02:21;02:31;"Okay, well, Seinfeld, I want to say one thing. I haven't been looking at it every day, but I noticed that I think it got to about 2,500 very quickly."
02:31;02:32;"Yeah."
02:32;02:35;"And the growth has really slowed."
02:35;02:45;"Yeah, well, you haven't really been pumping it. I mean, nobody here has really been supporting it the way I have, so it's been its own autonomous thing, but if you want to
lend some of your juice to it-"
02:45;02:48;"That's not how virality works."
02:48;02:51;"Virality comes from content."
02:51;02:53;"Content is hot fire."
02:53;02:57;"Okay, I want you to get to 5K."
02:57;02:59;"By when?"
02:59;03:01;"Two weeks. Can you do it?"
03:01;03:06;"If we can mention the Twitter account every 10 minutes throughout this episode, I can guarantee you-"
03:06;03:22;"Okay, we have a Time Crisis Twitter. It's @TimeCrisis2000, and it's run by Seinfeld 2000. But anyway, Seinfeld, I wanted to have you on for this first segment, because
as we said, the world's changed in many ways."
03:22;03:37;"But Time Crisis, we talk about what's happening in the world, but it's also supposed to be a brief Sunday respite from some of the brutality of what's going on. And it's
important to continue to take these moments to enjoy culture."
03:37;03:45;"So I wanted to talk about a song, because originally this was a music show, before it became a corporate food history and politics."
03:45;03:52;"Originally this was a music show, so I want to play you guys a song. I assume you know it. Let's just listen to it first."
03:52;03:54;"It's a jazz tune."
04:22;04:24;"Yikes."
04:24;04:29;"So that's a classic tune. Who can identify it?"
04:29;04:31;"It's a Fraser theme."
04:31;04:43;"That's the Fraser theme. So it's in a jazz style. It's a very notable 90s TV theme song, because it's jazz, and because- who's that on vocals?"
04:43;04:44;"Kelsey."
04:44;04:49;"That's Kelsey Grammer, the star of Fraser, singing the show's theme song, which is pretty rare."
04:49;04:58;"So Seinfeld 2000, can you contextualize Fraser? As somebody who really cares a lot about 90s TV, just explain what Fraser is, in case anybody at home is not familiar."
04:58;05:06;"Okay, well, to understand Fraser, I think you've got to take it back to another show called Cheers. Do you remember Cheers, the TV show?"
05:06;05:07;"Vaguely. Ted Danson."
05:07;05:21;"Kelsey Grammer, Fraser was a character who was in that show, and he was kind of the erudite, educated doctor who would come in, and he'd provide his sort of elevated,
highbrow perspective."
05:21;05:35;"Cheers ends, and a few years later, Fraser has his own spinoff, where he's now set in Seattle. He's a radio host. He lives with his father, and has a dog named Eddie.
That's his father's dog."
05:35;05:39;"And is there a jazz element to the show? Does he play a little sax on the side?"
05:39;05:40;"He's sophisticated."
05:40;05:44;"Yeah, he liked jazz. He's a sophisticated man."
05:44;05:48;"It's like Carrie on Homeland. She's a big jazz head."
05:48;05:55;"Oh my god, I totally forgot. I stopped watching Homeland because it got so racist. But I guess that was her redeeming quality."
05:55;05:59;"And that show has the worst theme music of any show in history."
05:59;06:00;"Oh yeah, it has this kind of like…"
06:00;06:01;"Collage-y."
06:01;06:02;"Yeah, yeah."
06:02;06:04;"Like, jazzy, collage-y."
06:04;06:06;"Yeah, there's that like…"
06:06;06:20;"Homeland is the original La La Land. I just realized the connection. They're both lands, and they're both about jazz. La La Land is kind of like, they didn't want to
touch some of those more political elements."
06:20;06:22;"Okay, but anyway, back to Fraser."
06:22;06:23;"Yeah."
06:23;06:24;"Wait, I got a question for you."
06:24;06:25;"Shoot."
06:25;06:30;"We all know that you're a huge fan of NBC in the 90s. Seinfeld, Friends, you name it, right?"
06:30;06:31;"Not Friends."
06:31;06:33;"Oh, you don't like Friends?"
06:33;06:34;"Dude."
06:34;06:35;"Okay, alright, alright."
06:35;06:36;"Follow me on…"
06:36;06:44;"You specifically like Seinfeld. Okay, so we know hardcore Seinfeld heads hate Friends. Where do they fall on Fraser?"
06:44;06:53;"Fraser's cool. I mean, Fraser never really tried to ape the Seinfeld formula. It was doing its own thing. You know, the two shows kind of complemented each other."
06:53;06:54;"I think they were on different nights of the week."
06:54;06:56;"That's why you hate Friends. You think it was aping Seinfeld."
06:56;07:08;"Yeah, what they did was that they took the core elements of Seinfeld and they tried to pretty them up and, you know, we'll have better looking people and we'll have more
people and the apartment will be nicer and on and on. Give me a break."
07:08;07:09;"Wow."
07:09;07:10;"Sand off all the edges."
07:10;07:11;"Right?"
07:11;07:12;"Exactly."
07:12;07:23;"But I never thought of them as directly competing because Seinfeld tonally was very unique and it was ironic and it was original. Friends was just like a
straightforward sitcom, right?"
07:23;07:26;"I didn't think that they were even trying to go for the same…"
07:26;07:34;"I think Friends sort of like also had a bit of that focus on like the minutia of the day and like the stories were very small."
07:34;07:44;"I know what you mean. Friends is kind of like a more basic Seinfeld. But frankly, they're both kind of basic compared to the erudite, jazzy Seattle atmosphere of Fraser."
07:44;07:48;"Okay, I thought that the Fraser song was a Joni Mitchell song."
07:48;07:50;"Wait, you thought this was a Joni Mitchell song?"
07:50;08:03;"I thought it was a cover of a Joni Mitchell song. Yeah. Okay, can someone cue up the last song on Court and Spark? The 1974 Joni Mitchell album, Court and Spark, the last
song."
08:03;08:07;"Oh, this is the song. You think it's Twisted by Joni Mitchell?"
08:07;08:08;"Yeah."
08:08;08:11;"Okay, it's jazzy. I'll give you that."
08:30;08:31;"Do you like this song?"
08:31;08:36;"Not really. It's the worst song on Court and Spark, which is an amazing record."
08:43;08:47;"Oh, wow. So Nick just found some info."
08:47;08:49;"Okay, and this song was about an analyst."
08:49;08:57;"Okay, so you're right. Initially, okay, I didn't know this. Initially, in the pilot, they used this as the theme song."
08:57;08:58;"Boom."
08:58;08:59;"But then they couldn't afford it."
08:59;09:00;"Boom."
09:00;09:01;"All right. Wow, great ear, Jake."
09:01;09:04;"Starting 2017 in a very strong way."
09:13;09:22;"So that was not part of the story that I found, because part of the reason I wanted to listen to the Frazier song is because I read the story about how it was composed."
09:22;09:27;"So one interesting thing, so in the Joni Mitchell song, she says, ""My analyst told me."""
09:27;09:34;"And Frazier is about an analyst, about a very erudite, sophisticated Seattle psychiatrist."
09:34;09:44;"However, if you listen to the actual Frazier theme song, you're not going to hear a lot of chitter-chatter about psychiatry."
09:44;09:46;"If anything, he's talking about food."
09:46;09:47;"Right."
09:47;09:56;"I found this great blog where the songwriter, composer Bruce Miller, finally opened up all these years later."
09:56;09:57;"[Laughter]"
09:57;09:59;"Broke his silence."
09:59;10:03;"This is what Bruce Miller, the composer of the song, had to say."
10:03;10:10;"""I was told they wanted something pretty eclectic and jazzy. We now know. They wanted something that sounded like that Joni Mitchell song."
10:10;10:14;"But to avoid any direct references to specific subject matter."
10:14;10:23;"So it was necessary to stay away from words about psychiatry, radio shows, the name Frazier, and anything else directly indicating aspects of the show."""
10:23;10:25;"So just think about that."
10:25;10:31;"You're a songwriter, a composer, and you get this huge opportunity, the new Kelsey Grammer show."
10:31;10:33;"And you're psyched."
10:33;10:34;"Cheers, spin-off."
10:35;10:36;"You're psyched."
10:36;10:37;"This is a guaranteed hit."
10:38;10:39;"It's a big gig, right?"
10:39;10:40;"Tenth pole."
10:40;10:42;"And you're like, ""Okay, great. What's the show about?"""
10:42;10:52;"And then you get this kind of zen riddle where they say, ""Well, the thing is, unlike most theme songs, we don't want you to reference what the show's about."
10:52;10:55;"The show's about a psychiatrist, but don't talk about that."""
10:55;10:57;"And you can't even use the guy's name."
10:57;11:00;"It's gotta be a song about nothing."
11:00;11:01;"Basically."
11:01;11:02;"Yeah."
11:02;11:04;"Frazier is the true Seinfeld."
11:04;11:05;"Wait, what? No."
11:05;11:07;"Okay, moving on."
11:07;11:09;"So let's get back to Bruce Miller."
11:09;11:14;"""I immediately wrote the music itself, but then needed a lyric that would work."""
11:14;11:16;"Yeah, no, that's a hell of a challenge."
11:16;11:19;"I immediately ripped off the Joni Mitchell song, ""Twisted."""
11:19;11:21;"Who knows?"
11:21;11:24;"Bruce Miller, he's in a real bind."
11:24;11:26;"So let's get back to him."
11:26;11:33;"""So I called my friend Darryl Finnessy, who's really talented and really smart."
11:33;11:42;"I gave him the idea of the show, and he called back with the idea of tossed salads and scrambled eggs."
11:42;11:48;"At first I was a bit baffled myself, until he explained that these were things..."""
11:48;11:50;"You ready for the bombshell?"
11:50;11:51;"I'm ready."
11:51;11:56;"""Those are things that are mixed up, just like Frazier Crane's patience."""
11:56;12:01;"There it is."
12:01;12:02;"""Once we agreed on the--"""
12:02;12:03;"That is cosmic."
12:03;12:09;"""Once we agreed on this premise, by the time I finally understood it, we went into completing the song."
12:09;12:13;"I actually did contribute a couple lines, but the heavy lifting here was Darryl."""
12:13;12:15;"So I want everybody to remember that."
12:15;12:17;"This is not a solo Bruce Miller joint."
12:17;12:18;"Heavy lifting."
12:18;12:21;"""And lucky for me that I went to him in the first place."""
12:21;12:25;"And then he actually goes kind of line by line to talk about the whole song."
12:25;12:29;"So we know the opening lines is, ""Hey baby, I hear the blues a-callin'."""
12:29;12:33;"And that refers to patience with troubles calling into the radio show."
12:33;12:34;"Okay."
12:34;12:36;"""Tossed salads and scrambled eggs."""
12:36;12:37;"We already talked about that."
12:37;12:39;"""But maybe I seem a bit confused."""
12:39;12:41;"Frazier's personality was a little confusing."
12:41;12:43;"""Maybe, but I got you pegged."""
12:43;12:45;"Frazier does understand these people and helps them."
12:45;12:48;"""But I don't know what to do with those tossed salads and scrambled eggs."""
12:48;12:52;"""It's a tough business, and he's got to deal with those wild people every day."""
12:52;12:54;"""They're callin' again, oh oh."""
12:54;12:56;"That's self-explanatory."
12:56;13:00;"""When I first wrote the song, I instantly thought of the great jazz singer Mel Tormé."""
13:00;13:01;"Velvet Fog."
13:01;13:02;"Yeah, the Velvet Fog."
13:02;13:03;"A gorgeous voice."
13:03;13:05;"""He would have been perfect."""
13:05;13:08;"""But the producers wanted me to try Kelsey."""
13:08;13:11;"""And of course he really made it his own with his interpretation."""
13:11;13:12;"We can listen to some more."
13:12;13:13;"Kelsey really cuddly."
13:13;13:14;"He's got some cool ad libs."
13:14;13:20;"""But I don't know what to do with those tossed salads and scrambled eggs."""
13:20;13:22;"""They're callin' again."""
13:22;13:23;"The patience."
13:23;13:25;"""Scrambled eggs all over my face."""
13:25;13:26;"I bet that was a Kelsey ad lib."
13:26;13:29;"""What is a boy to do?"""
13:29;13:31;"""Goodnight, everybody!"""
13:31;13:32;"Wow."
13:32;13:36;"Kelsey Grammer famously, a hard-to-place accent."
13:36;13:39;"People often were confused by Frazier because Frazier and Niles,"
13:39;13:42;"they kind of seemed like they were British or something."
13:42;13:43;"There was something off about it."
13:43;13:45;"It sounded like Robin Williams a little."
13:45;13:47;"Yeah, what's the head of that guy who's like European?"
13:47;13:52;"Like really generic, upper-crust, erudite, rich guy voice."
13:52;13:54;"Like, ""Oh, I went to Harvard."""
13:54;13:55;"You know, it's like--"
13:55;13:56;"Well, Niles."
13:56;14:00;"Like the Dan Aykroyd character in Trading Places."
14:00;14:01;"Oh, it is very similar to that."
14:01;14:03;"It's like that sort of like--"
14:03;14:04;"""Come here, Valentine."""
14:04;14:06;"1% accent."
14:06;14:07;"Yeah."
14:07;14:08;"That's a great movie, Trading Places."
14:08;14:09;"Great film."
22:19;22:23;"So pivoting away, I want to talk more about TV shows and jazz,"
22:23;22:25;"but I think we'll save that for the next episode."
22:25;22:29;"With the more pressing matters at hand, obviously the world is a disaster."
22:29;22:33;"We're going to try to make Time Crisis a relatively safe space."
22:33;22:36;"One interesting thing that I read recently was that Trump,"
22:36;22:39;"the bad man who's now president,"
22:39;22:42;"a lot of people thought he wasn't going to like staying at the White House"
22:42;22:46;"because he's known as to be this real scumbag rich dude homebody."
22:46;22:49;"He likes to stay in his golden apartment,"
22:49;22:52;"and plus his son Barron is still in school in New York."
22:52;22:57;"It turns out his first week down in D.C., he stayed at the White House the whole time."
22:57;22:59;"So there's this New York Times article."
22:59;23:05;"The title is A Homebody Finds the Ultimate Home Office by Maggie Haberman."
23:05;23:11;"Isn't it funny how even as he's doing these absurd, immoral executive orders and stuff,"
23:11;23:16;"they still have to just also write about, ""Well, how's he finding the house?"""
23:16;23:18;"Yeah, a lifestyle piece."
23:18;23:20;"It's definitely not a puff piece, but whatever."
23:20;23:22;"He does like his midnight snacks."
23:22;23:24;"Yeah, exactly."
23:24;23:29;"So there's so many amazing quotes about this horrendous bad person."
23:29;23:33;"It says, ""His aide said privately that he seemed apprehensive about the move to his new home."""
23:33;23:36;"It sounds like you're talking about a 10-year-old. This is a 70-year-old man."
23:36;23:38;"I don't know if I'm going to like it."
23:38;23:40;"""But Mr. Trump has discovered there's a lot he likes."
23:40;23:43;"'These are the most beautiful phones I've ever used in my life,'"
23:43;23:46;"Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview Tuesday evening."
23:46;23:49;"'The world's most secure system,' he added, laughing."
23:49;23:51;"'The words just explode in the air.'"
23:51;23:54;"What he meant was that no one was listening and recording his words."""
23:54;23:57;"So also just picture this. This is how the world works."
23:57;24:00;"This new president out here ruining people's lives,"
24:00;24:04;"and he's getting on the phone with the New York Times just to chat about how he likes his new house."
24:04;24:07;"And one of the first things he says to this New York Times reporter is,"
24:07;24:11;"""These are the most beautiful phones I've ever used in my life."""
24:11;24:15;"He must just be like, ""Uh, okay, sir."""
24:15;24:16;"I mean, I kind of like this."
24:16;24:19;"Let's talk about the phones. I mean, what's the deal with the phones?"
24:19;24:21;"I think he just meant that nobody's listening."
24:21;24:24;"Is he so paranoid he thinks people are listening to him all the time?"
24:24;24:26;"Do you think it's like an old phone?"
24:26;24:29;"Maybe he's just talking about he likes that it's a secure system."
24:29;24:31;"It's got a landline. You think it's cordless?"
24:31;24:34;"Yeah, I wonder what kind of actual phone they have in the White House."
24:34;24:39;"I like this because on Time Crisis we like to talk about routines, what people do."
24:39;24:41;"""His mornings, he said, are spent just as they were in Trump Tower."
24:41;24:46;"He rises before 6 a.m., watches television tuned to a cable channel first in the residence."""
24:46;24:50;"As many people have pointed out, sometimes when he gets these absurd tweets off,"
24:50;24:54;"you can literally trace it to the thing he saw on Fox News that set him off."
24:54;24:58;"""He rises before 6 a.m., watches television tuned to a cable channel first in the residence,"
24:58;25:03;"and later in a small dining room in the West Wing, and looks through the morning newspapers,"
25:03;25:06;"The New York Times, The New York Post, and now The Washington Post."""
25:06;25:15;"I like that character trait of this dipsh that he wakes up, turns the TV on in the bedroom,"
25:15;25:18;"and then shuttles over to breakfast in the West Wing."
25:18;25:19;"More TV."
25:19;25:20;"Turns the TV back on."
25:20;25:25;"That's like some real '90s middle-class people started having a little TV in the kitchen."
25:25;25:26;"Right."
25:26;25:30;"He's kind of setting us up for this horrendous internet-everywhere nonstop thing"
25:30;25:33;"where you wake up and throw on the TV in the bedroom."
25:33;25:34;"Right."
25:34;25:36;"Then you go and start making breakfast, throwing the little TV."
25:36;25:37;"Brutal."
25:37;25:40;"So anyway, in this arc, he keeps talking about, he told the reporter,"
25:40;25:46;"there's a lot of boardrooms in the White House, and he's been enjoying showing people around the White House."
25:46;25:48;"But this is the reason that I bring it up."
25:48;25:53;"""His first breakfast at the White House was Saturday morning, the day after the inauguration."
25:53;25:58;"A buffet in the residence, spread with fresh fruit, pastries, and other treats,"
25:58;26:01;"where his adult children and their families joined him."""
26:01;26:07;"One of the funniest phrases in the English language is ""adult children."""
26:07;26:14;"Also, I'm so curious, just about how does information--that's a big theme of the moment is,"
26:14;26:16;"how does information flow?"
26:16;26:17;"Where do these things come from?"
26:17;26:24;"Did this reporter, Maggie Haberman, have some other info that told her that there was a buffet for breakfast?"
26:24;26:31;"Or did Trump literally say to her, ""The first breakfast was a wonderful buffet."
26:31;26:35;"We had fresh fruit, pastries, and other treats."""
26:35;26:37;"Because it's so detailed."
26:37;26:42;"So anyway, he had that breakfast, and I guess already on Saturday--this is a quote from The New York Times--"
26:42;26:50;"""The kitchen has been stocked with the same types of snacks that Mr. Trump had on his private plane,"
26:50;26:52;"including Lay's potato chips."""
26:52;26:53;"Boom!"
26:53;26:56;"Boom. Okay. So there's a lot to unpack there."
26:56;26:58;"You think there were Lay's in the Obama White House?"
26:58;27:00;"Yeah, if he wanted them."
27:00;27:06;"I mean, it's reasonable to imagine that the White House would have some kind of storeroom that would have--"
27:06;27:07;"An assortment of snacks."
27:07;27:10;"An assortment, including the number one snack chip in the country."
27:10;27:14;"But there's something about the way this was written that really made it seem like Trump needs his Lay's."
27:14;27:15;"Specific."
27:15;27:18;"Because that's the thing about him, right? He just eats junk food."
27:18;27:20;"I think he's wilds out on KFC and junk food."
27:20;27:24;"We've always tiptoed around on this show, do we support Lay's or do we not?"
27:24;27:31;"I gotta say, after reading that, I don't have a hankering for any Lay's."
27:31;27:32;"Those are Trump chips."
43:27;43:31;"Well you know what the intermediary step incorporation made me think of?"
43:32;43:34;"The movie that we saw last night."
43:34;43:38;"Oh, The Founder."
43:38;43:44;"That's right. Jake made the great call that we should go see the film The Founder,"
43:44;43:48;"which is the story of Ray Kroc, the supposed founder of McDonald's."
43:48;43:50;"It's played by Michael Keaton."
43:50;43:55;"And it's kind of the story of how McDonald's grew from this small place"
43:55;43:58;"in San Bernardino, California run by the McDonald brothers."
43:58;44:00;"Maurice and Dick."
44:00;44:02;"Maurice, forgot that."
44:02;44:08;"And how this guy from Illinois, Ray Kroc, kind of came across their burger stand"
44:08;44:11;"and kind of transformed into what it is today."
44:11;44:12;"Yeah."
44:12;44:15;"And he kind of did it partially by establishing an intermediary company"
44:15;44:19;"which was buying up all the real estate and forcing McDonald's franchisees"
44:19;44:24;"to lease the real estate from them, increasing the profitability."
44:24;44:26;"The Franchise Realty Corporation."
44:28;44:31;"So first things first, did you enjoy watching this film?"
44:31;44:33;"Yeah, I did."
44:33;44:34;"Is it a good film?"
44:34;44:37;"No, it's tonally muddled."
44:37;44:40;"It doesn't know what it wants to be. It's kind of two movies."
44:40;44:48;"On one hand, a sort of benign, glossy portrait of this successful businessman."
44:48;44:54;"And on the other hand, it's sort of like a dark, seedy underbelly of ambition and greed."
44:54;44:56;"It's in an awkward middle ground."
44:56;44:59;"It's a little bit unclear what the movie is saying about Ray Kroc."
44:59;45:01;"I mean, he definitely was not a great dude."
45:01;45:02;"Yeah."
45:02;45:07;"It reminded me a lot of The Social Network in that it kind of pits two brothers"
45:07;45:11;"who kind of get into a head-on collision with a scrappy outsider"
45:11;45:14;"who takes their idea and makes billions."
45:14;45:16;"Right, right."
45:16;45:20;"Zuckerberg is the Ray Kroc of our era."
45:20;45:27;"You know, the famous quote in The Social Network from the Mark Zuckerberg character is,"
45:27;45:30;"""If you started Facebook, you would have started Facebook."""
45:30;45:31;"Right."
45:31;45:36;"Which is kind of reminiscent also, I think, of the Trump line, ""It's 'cause I'm smart."""
45:36;45:40;"Which basically is this kind of like idiotic American concept that's kind of like"
45:40;45:43;"whoever got away with it owns it and is the smart one."
45:43;45:45;"And it's kind of similar to The Founder."
45:45;45:50;"It's like these two brothers, these kind of nice guys--"
45:50;45:52;"the movie at least makes it seem like these are these nice guys"
45:52;45:56;"who just want to run an efficient, tasty, family-friendly burger stand."
45:56;45:59;"They had devised the Speedy system."
45:59;46:01;"That's what separated McDonald's from the rest of the pack."
46:01;46:03;"Right, which was their sort of response to Henry Ford."
46:03;46:08;"They looked at the automated factory production styles of making automobiles"
46:08;46:10;"and they applied that to hamburger making."
46:10;46:13;"So they were passionate about the speed of their system"
46:13;46:15;"and they were passionate about the quality of their food."
46:15;46:18;"And I think Ray Kroc was passionate about business."
46:18;46:19;"Right."
46:19;46:22;"And that's the fundamental conflict in the film."
46:22;46:24;"So then Ray Kroc shows up and he's like, ""This is amazing."
46:24;46:27;"We could easily replicate this."""
46:27;46:31;"And every town has a church and every town has a town square."
46:31;46:32;"That's a classic line in this film."
46:32;46:34;"Every town could have a McDonald's."
46:34;46:37;"He sees it from the get-go, which is kind of interesting."
46:37;46:38;"And he did it."
46:38;46:42;"He took their idea and turned it into a Coca-Cola-esque corporation."
46:42;46:46;"I mean, yeah, the movie was flawed, but it still managed to convey"
46:46;46:49;"the sort of arc of his vision and career."
46:49;46:53;"I think in the beginning he was genuinely passionate about"
46:53;46:56;"McDonald's being a family-friendly establishment."
46:56;47:01;"And I think he was genuinely passionate about being an American entrepreneur."
47:01;47:04;"I think he legitimately saw McDonald's as a way to improve"
47:04;47:07;"the quality of life in the U.S."
47:07;47:10;"And then as the movie progresses, you see him sort of like"
47:10;47:13;"that grand vision, that grand dream becomes curdled and corrupted"
47:13;47:16;"by his will for power and money."
47:16;47:18;"That's a very classic journey."
47:18;47:21;"We have dreams when we're young."
47:21;47:26;"When you have a dream, if the dream involves being rich and famous,"
47:26;47:30;"but also maybe something positive like making people happy or something,"
47:30;47:33;"when you're still dreaming it, it's all tied together."
47:33;47:37;"So you don't actually have to parse out what's the most important part of your dream."
47:37;47:40;"So, you know, like in music or something, when you're young,"
47:40;47:43;"maybe you'll be like, ""Oh, wow, I want to be a rock star."
47:43;47:46;"I want to be a professional musician."""
47:46;47:50;"And I've had this conversation a lot with various entertainers or something,"
47:50;47:52;"because then eventually you get to this place where you're like--"
47:52;47:55;"When I would daydream about-- I don't know who was cool when I was a kid."
47:55;47:57;"Stone Temple Pilots."
47:57;47:59;"Stone Temple Pilots. When I would daydream about--"
47:59;48:02;"I wasn't much of a fan. Rest in peace, Scott Weiland, though."
48:02;48:05;"But you were like, ""If I could only play bass in STP,"
48:05;48:07;"my life would be cool."""
48:07;48:09;"They're playing the MTV Music Awards in 1994."
48:09;48:11;"So I'm saying, when you're young and you have this dream,"
48:11;48:13;"like what if I was in Stone Temple Pilots?"
48:13;48:15;"It's a simple dream. You're just in Stone Temple Pilots."
48:15;48:17;"You don't have to ask yourself these questions."
48:17;48:20;"Do I want to be in Stone Temple Pilots because I want to rock out on great tunes,"
48:20;48:22;"enjoy camaraderie with two to three other--"
48:22;48:23;"Great guys."
48:23;48:26;"Great guys. Is that the primary thing?"
48:26;48:28;"Or is it because I want to have that Scott Weiland money"
48:28;48:30;"and that Scott Weiland success?"
48:30;48:32;"And that Scott Weiland respect."
48:32;48:35;"Exactly. So you don't have to--"
48:35;48:37;"You don't have to parse it out."
48:37;48:39;"Exactly. You don't have to parse it out."
48:39;48:41;"And that's like the classic American dream thing."
48:41;48:43;"You don't have to parse it out until you get there."
48:43;48:48;"So Ray Kroc, like you said, it's very possible this guy sees this efficient little restaurant"
48:48;48:52;"and says, ""This is great because if we bring this to the rest of the country,"
48:52;48:55;"people can go to a restaurant and not have to worry about waiting forever."
48:55;48:58;"They can spend more time with their families, and we're going to make it clean."""
48:58;48:59;"Family-friendly."
48:59;49:00;"And we're going to make it consistent."
49:00;49:01;"Affordable."
49:01;49:06;"Right. If you're driving cross-country with your family, you don't have to pull into some place."
49:06;49:09;"I believe that maybe he truly believes he was bettering people's lives."
49:09;49:12;"And of course it's a business, so he expects some profit."
49:12;49:15;"But then you reach these moments where it's like, ""Okay, you did something good."
49:15;49:17;"You are making people's lives better."""
49:17;49:20;"The catch is you're not making as much money as you thought you were."
49:20;49:24;"You successfully franchised 100 restaurants, and yet you're still in debt."
49:24;49:25;"This is what happens in the movie."
49:25;49:26;"Right."
49:26;49:27;"This is not a spoiler, I don't think."
49:27;49:28;"Right."
49:28;49:30;"This is the point where you're like, ""I've built a brand."
49:30;49:31;"That feels pretty good."
49:31;49:36;"I'm serving good, clean hamburgers to families, and yet I'm still not raking it in."""
49:36;49:40;"That's when people start realizing that they like money more than they thought,"
49:40;49:41;"and they start making decisions."
49:41;49:43;"What matters in the end?"
49:43;49:45;"And on that note, let's listen to some Stone Temple Pilots."
51:40;51:42;"I feel like Starbucks is a good example."
51:42;51:47;"When I first went to a Starbucks when I was like 11 or 12, they were doing a similar thing."
51:47;51:52;"Starbucks was kind of like supposed to be like, ""Hey, not everybody gets to live in Greenwich Village."""
51:52;51:54;"You know what I'm saying?"
51:54;51:58;"Like, yeah, we don't all get to live in Greenwich Village or San Francisco."
51:58;51:59;"Right."
51:59;52:03;"We don't all have like a, you know, three poetry slams down the block,"
52:03;52:10;"but you still deserve a place to go drink a cup of coffee and read a book and not feel like a bum."
52:10;52:15;"You still deserve to go spend $3 to be in a place that you feel an air of culture."
52:15;52:16;"Frankly, I agree with that."
52:16;52:17;"Yeah."
52:17;52:19;"I've lived in cities. I've lived in suburbs."
52:19;52:23;"It's like I hate the monopoly on like, you know, on cool."
52:23;52:24;"Yeah, we're not all Frazier Crane."
52:24;52:27;"We're not all living in Seattle drinking fine coffee."
52:27;52:31;"But so I like the idea that like just because you live in a smaller town or something,"
52:31;52:37;"there's still like a coffee shop that has like decent coffee and feels like culture."
52:37;52:41;"And I guess Starbucks was kind of providing that for, I mean, it sounds really idiotic as I say it out loud,"
52:41;52:44;"but Starbucks is kind of like providing that in a way."
52:44;52:46;"Similar to Whole Foods now and Starbucks would come to a town."
52:46;52:51;"It's kind of like, I think there probably was a type of person who felt like finally a place for me."
52:51;52:52;"But you know what I mean?"
52:52;52:57;"Like that's not a crazy feeling like you live somewhere where maybe there's nowhere cool to hang out."
52:57;52:58;"You don't like going to the diner."
52:58;52:59;"There's no culture."
52:59;53:00;"There's no, yeah."
53:00;53:02;"Or there's not the culture that you're looking for."
53:02;53:06;"You can't go to the diner anymore because Rusty gives you the stink eye."
53:06;53:10;"And now finally the Starbucks, it's like a place you can just go have a cup of coffee."
53:10;53:13;"And they don't have, you know, the lighting's decent."
53:13;53:16;"So maybe Starbucks did start out by providing some decent service."
53:16;53:21;"It's like we're going to bring you good coffee that's made the right way and give you a place to hang out."
53:21;53:24;"But then, you know, then the growth was just insane."
53:24;53:27;"And like the Starbucks just became like dirtier."
53:27;53:29;"In my opinion, the coffee got worse."
53:29;53:31;"Yeah, the coffee's undrinkable."
53:31;53:32;"Disgusting."
53:32;53:36;"We're dissing a lot of beverages on this show."
53:36;53:37;"Yeah."
53:37;53:38;"But you know what I mean?"
53:38;53:44;"It's like at some point I think we can all agree that Starbucks for all their fronting about like social justice"
53:44;53:48;"and being like, you know, a place where you can like buy--"
53:48;53:50;"Buy a brand new Joni Mitchell CD."
53:50;53:51;"But I don't know."
53:51;53:54;"Maybe Starbucks still does provide that for people."
53:54;53:55;"I don't know."
53:55;53:56;"It's complicated, man."
53:56;54:01;"You know, this is a wall we hit a lot on Time Crisis is this feeling of this is the world that we were born into."
54:01;54:06;"Are we supposed to want to end big corporate chains?"
54:06;54:09;"Or do we have to kind of find the humanity in them ourselves?"
54:09;54:10;"You know what I'm saying?"
54:10;54:15;"If I was spending time in a place that didn't have like all these artisanal coffee shops and there's just a Starbucks"
54:15;54:20;"and I was like, hey, you want to like go over to Starbucks and, you know, just like sit and have a coffee or something?"
54:20;54:24;"And somebody like got all like, ugh, I don't want to go to Starbucks."
54:24;54:27;"I'd be like, man, let's just experience a little bit of joy."
54:27;54:30;"You know it's going to be better than the gas station coffee."
54:30;54:31;"Lighten up."
54:32;54:40;"Like, yeah, OK, it would be cool if every town had a neighborhood independent coffee shop."
54:40;54:42;"But this is the world we're living in, man."
54:42;54:44;"Can we just go to Starbucks and enjoy it?"
54:44;54:45;"It's not that bad."
54:45;54:46;"They got grapes."
54:46;54:47;"Can we just do that?"
54:47;54:48;"Is that a bad attitude?"
54:48;54:49;"No."
54:49;54:50;"Where do you draw the line?"
54:50;54:51;"I guess that's what I'm asking."
54:51;54:52;"Carl's Jr."
54:52;54:59;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
54:59;55:04;"I've got to run to keep from hatin'"
55:04;55:09;"And I'm bound to keep on ridin'"
55:09;55:14;"I've got one more silver dollar"
55:14;55:17;"But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no"
55:17;55:22;"Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider"
55:23;55:34;"Not all on the clothesline, baby"
55:34;55:39;"And the road goes on forever"
55:39;55:44;"I've got one more silver dollar"
55:44;55:47;"But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no"
55:47;55:52;"Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider"
55:53;55:54;"guitar solo"
55:54;55:59;"electric guitar solo"
56:37;56:42;"And I've gone by the point of carin'"
56:42;56:47;"Some old man I'll soon be sharin'"
56:47;56:52;"And I've got one more silver dollar"
56:52;56:56;"But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no"
56:56;57:01;"Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider"
57:01;57:06;"No, I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no"
57:06;57:11;"I'm not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider"
57:11;57:16;"No, I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no"
57:16;57:21;"I'm not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider"
57:21;57:26;"No, I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no"
57:26;57:32;"I'm not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider"
57:32;57:37;"guitar solo"
57:43;57:47;"I wonder what the McDonald's Corporation calls you as a consumer"
57:47;57:49;"'Cause like they probably have their heavy user"
57:49;57:50;"Yeah, yeah"
57:50;57:53;"He's like, we got our heavy user two to three times a day"
57:53;57:54;"Very infrequent"
57:54;57:57;"But then we have this infrequent guy"
57:57;57:58;"Like maybe spontaneous user"
57:58;58:00;"We got the spontaneous user"
58:00;58:02;"Spontaneous/desperate user"
58:02;58:04;"Who's doing breakfast at best"
58:04;58:07;"At best we're selling this guy an egg McMuffin and a coffee"
58:07;58:10;"He's doing like .7 breakfasts annually"
58:10;58:12;"I'm not on their radar, dude"
58:12;58:14;"I'm doing like an airport"
58:14;58:17;"Like Boise, Idaho airport"
58:17;58:20;"How do we get those breakfast numbers up?"
58:20;58:24;"But there probably is a type of consumer who's like a breakfast only McDonald's guy"
58:24;58:25;"I can totally imagine that"
58:25;58:26;"Breakfast 24 hours, dude"
58:26;58:27;"They went there"
58:27;58:28;"Remember last year?"
58:28;58:29;"I guess that was probably a way to be like"
58:29;58:34;"We got this type of consumer who's coming in on the way to work"
58:34;58:38;"They like the coffee, they like the price, and they like the hash browns"
58:38;58:43;"But for whatever reason they find lunch or dinner at McDonald's to be uncouth"
58:43;58:47;"How do we get that guy to broaden his spectrum, so to speak?"
58:47;58:52;"How do we get that guy to maybe occasionally get an extra value meal?"
58:52;58:55;"Oh, you know, that's one thing I read in an article about the Coke book"
58:55;58:56;"I should ask Bart"
58:56;59:02;"But apparently Coke was semi-responsible for the McDonald's super-size idea"
59:02;59:05;"Coke said to McDonald's in the 90s"
59:05;59:09;"Why don't you create some kind of special thing that's only a little bit more"
59:09;59:11;"That just increases the volume?"
59:11;59:13;"More fries, more Coke"
59:13;59:14;"God, that's buff"
59:14;59:18;"I guess on the positive side"
59:18;59:21;"One man in a very bad time that we're living in"
59:21;59:23;"When we think about the super-size debacle"
59:23;59:25;"One man, Morgan Spurlock"
59:25;59:28;"He kind of gets credit for taking down the super-size option"
59:28;59:30;"That's a crazy documentary"
59:30;59:32;"Yeah, that was wild when it came out"
59:32;59:34;"He can't get hard at the end?"
59:34;59:36;"Is that what happens?"
59:36;59:39;"After 30 days of McDonald's, he experienced erectile dysfunction"
59:39;59:41;"That's bonkers"
59:41;59:43;"That is just crazy"
59:43;59:45;"Take it all the way back to the beginning"
59:45;59:48;"If McDonald's was about a place that a family can get together"
59:48;59:50;"Know that the food is going to be good quality"
59:50;59:52;"Know that it's not going to take a long time"
59:52;59:53;"And then you look at it today"
59:53;59:58;"It's horrible that we can't trust these brands that are such a big part of our life"
59:58;01:00:03;"The basic solid of not creating dysfunction in our sex lives"
01:00:04;01:00:08;"We can't even count on our government and our favorite brands"
01:00:08;01:00:11;"To disrespect our marital duties"
01:00:11;01:00:13;"My man"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"That's brutal"
01:00:15;01:00:18;"Obviously today was a bit of a respite from the horrible things happening in the world"
01:00:18;01:00:23;"But obviously we're off to a pretty brutal start in terms of the new regime"
01:00:23;01:00:27;"And how they're taking even more power away from the American consumer"
01:00:27;01:00:31;"In terms of lack of information about what's happening in the environment"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"What's happening in our food"
01:00:33;01:00:34;"Think about that"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"I'm maybe an extreme example"
01:00:36;01:00:40;"As a kind of musician man about town"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"I never cook"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"I'm grabbing a burrito on the go"
01:00:44;01:00:45;"Are you?"
01:00:45;01:00:46;"Taco"
01:00:46;01:00:47;"Okay"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"I'm grabbing a taco on the go"
01:00:49;01:00:50;"Too many carbs in that burrito"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"Yeah, too many carbs in the burrito"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"I'm post-mating"
01:00:53;01:01:00;"I rely so much on my belief that the food products out there surrounding me"
01:01:00;01:01:01;"Are not going to kill me"
01:01:01;01:01:02;"And you know what?"
01:01:02;01:01:03;"Even if I did cook"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"I'm still going to be buying food from strangers"
01:01:05;01:01:07;"Most of it at the supermarket"
01:01:07;01:01:09;"Even if you go to the farmer's market"
01:01:09;01:01:12;"It's not like you literally watch the person pick the carrot out of the ground"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"So we rely so much on the trust"
01:01:14;01:01:19;"That there's a system in place to make sure that these foods don't stop us from fulfilling our marital duties"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"But even more, just kill us"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"We trust so much"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"Now we're losing even more of that trust"
01:01:25;01:01:26;"Imagine that"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"You go to the grocery store"
01:01:28;01:01:29;"And I mean this stuff happens"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"It used to happen more"
01:01:30;01:01:32;"You go to the grocery store"
01:01:32;01:01:34;"You buy a can of progresso soup"
01:01:34;01:01:35;"Italian wedding"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"You go home, throw it on the stove"
01:01:37;01:01:38;"You eat it"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"You should think that you're getting nourishment"
01:01:40;01:01:41;"What if you ate that"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"And there was something in it that killed you?"
01:01:43;01:01:44;"That would suck"
01:01:44;01:01:46;"That's basically what I'm saying"
01:04:51;01:04:54;"Alright, we could talk about this all day"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"How about some top five, get some music"
01:04:56;01:04:59;"It's time for the top five"
01:04:59;01:05:02;"Five on iTunes"
01:05:02;01:05:06;"So, we just experienced"
01:05:06;01:05:08;"The first week"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"Of President Trump in office"
01:05:10;01:05:11;"Yeah"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"As we compare Trump to previous presidents"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"You always gotta keep in mind"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"Sometimes things are incomparable"
01:05:17;01:05:19;"Sometimes things happen that truly have no precedent"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"You gotta be ready for it"
01:05:21;01:05:23;"But, just for fun"
01:05:23;01:05:26;"We're gonna compare the top five songs this week"
01:05:26;01:05:29;"And this is a week that will have gone down in history"
01:05:29;01:05:32;"The first week of President Trump"
01:05:32;01:05:35;"We're gonna compare it to 36 years ago"
01:05:35;01:05:37;"The first week of President Reagan"
01:05:37;01:05:38;"Huh"
01:05:38;01:05:39;"1981"
01:05:39;01:05:40;"Okay"
01:05:40;01:05:42;"So we'll be comparing the top five songs on iTunes"
01:05:42;01:05:43;"2017"
01:05:43;01:05:45;"To the top five billboard hits"
01:05:45;01:05:47;"This week in 1981"
01:05:47;01:05:50;"So we're gonna start with the number five song"
01:05:51;01:05:53;"When Reagan first took office"
01:05:53;01:05:56;"This is a great one, I love this song"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"And I know you do too"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"Oh"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"Nice"
01:06:01;01:06:04;"So just imagine"
01:06:04;01:06:09;"You're a left wing kid"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"You voted for Carter"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"Instead you get this maniac"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"Reagan in office"
01:06:15;01:06:18;"Well, it's actually fitting because"
01:06:18;01:06:20;"Reagan's vibe was like"
01:06:20;01:06:22;"It's morning in America"
01:06:22;01:06:25;"A return to American optimism and power"
01:06:25;01:06:26;"Right"
01:06:26;01:06:29;"And this Bruce Springsteen song is like a retro song"
01:06:29;01:06:30;"It's a retro song"
01:06:30;01:06:33;"It's like absolutely like a 1950s kinda"
01:06:33;01:06:37;"Didn't he write this in response to singing the Ramones?"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"Yeah, he saw them play in Asbury Park"
01:06:39;01:06:43;"Joey Ramone asked him if he would write a song for the Ramones"
01:06:43;01:06:44;"He wrote this song and his manager was like"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"Don't give that one away Bruce"
01:06:46;01:06:47;"Yeah"
01:06:47;01:06:49;"Was this his first"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"Like top five single or something?"
01:06:51;01:06:52;"I don't know"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"It was his first really big single"
01:06:54;01:06:55;"Like Born to Run was big"
01:06:55;01:06:59;"But this was his first like top five hit or something"
01:06:59;01:07:03;"The King's come back"
01:07:03;01:07:09;"This is a song about the"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"It's kind of Ray Kroc-esque"
01:07:11;01:07:12;"It's about the"
01:07:12;01:07:15;"These insatiable desires we humans have"
01:07:15;01:07:16;"It's never enough"
01:07:16;01:07:17;"Right"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"Everybody's got a hungry heart"
01:07:19;01:07:21;"It's a very simple idea"
01:07:21;01:07:23;"I think the hungry heart means"
01:07:23;01:07:24;"It's like you're searching"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"Always looking for more"
01:07:26;01:07:30;"Like a river that don't know where it's flowing"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"Exactly"
01:07:31;01:07:34;"I took a wrong turn and I just kept going"
01:07:34;01:07:38;"Kinda, you know, it was also a fitting song to ring in the Reagan years"
01:07:38;01:07:42;"Because it's this like optimism covering up all this like horrible stuff"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"So like it's a kinda happy"
01:07:44;01:07:45;"It's a happy feeling song"
01:07:45;01:07:46;"Right"
01:07:46;01:07:48;"Some people may think it's just about falling in love or something"
01:07:48;01:07:49;"And I mean it kind of is"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"But the opening line is"
01:07:51;01:07:54;"Got away from kids in Baltimore, Jack"
01:07:54;01:07:55;"I went out for a ride"
01:07:55;01:07:57;"And I never went back"
01:07:57;01:07:58;"Classic Bruce"
01:07:58;01:08:00;"I mean just sort of like"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"Yeah, like a nice optimistic rock song"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"With this sad kernel"
01:08:04;01:08:05;"Yeah"
01:08:05;01:08:07;"Great"
01:08:07;01:08:08;"So what's the"
01:08:08;01:08:09;"We're off to a great start here"
01:08:09;01:08:10;"We're off to a great start"
01:08:10;01:08:11;"Downhill from here"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"Can't you just like picture like the kid"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"Whose parents are watching Reagan's inauguration"
01:08:15;01:08:16;"And he's just like this"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"Goes upstairs, puts on his headphones"
01:08:18;01:08:20;"Listens to Bruce's Hungry Heart"
01:08:20;01:08:21;"Count it"
01:08:21;01:08:22;"So"
01:08:22;01:08:23;"Straight into the river, dude"
01:08:23;01:08:26;"So now as we return to 2017"
01:08:26;01:08:27;"These are the songs"
01:08:27;01:08:30;"That are in the future Adam Curtis documentary"
01:08:30;01:08:32;"That are gonna define"
01:08:32;01:08:33;"Right"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"Trump's first week in office"
01:08:35;01:08:36;"I mean this is fitting"
01:08:36;01:08:37;"Reality"
01:08:37;01:08:38;"The number"
01:08:38;01:08:41;"The number five song"
01:08:41;01:08:42;"On iTunes"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"Yeah"
01:08:43;01:08:44;"The week"
01:08:44;01:08:45;"When Trump took office"
01:08:45;01:08:47;"It's called Bad Things"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"You remember this one, Jake?"
01:08:49;01:08:54;"This is Machine Gun Kelly"
01:08:54;01:08:55;"I don't know this"
01:08:55;01:08:56;"And Camila Cabello"
01:08:56;01:08:57;"I'm just"
01:08:57;01:08:59;"I'm still laughing about the Adam Curtis"
01:08:59;01:09:00;"Right"
01:09:00;01:09:01;"Character you were doing over this"
01:09:01;01:09:02;"Oh yeah"
01:09:02;01:09:06;"The liberal elite of the West was"
01:09:06;01:09:07;"Oh God"
01:09:07;01:09:10;"But as President Trump"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"It's hard even"
01:09:12;01:09:15;"But the Democrats were nowhere to be found"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"Don't matter what you say"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"Don't matter what you do"
01:09:19;01:09:22;"I only wanna do bad things"
01:09:22;01:09:23;"To you"
01:09:23;01:09:24;"So good"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"That you can't explain it"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"Chuck Schumer and Cory Booker"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"Implied they were the resistance"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"But this was a fantasy"
01:09:32;01:09:35;"Oh you know what I found out about this song?"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"Actually we gotta shout out"
01:09:37;01:09:39;"Long time Tom Crisis listener"
01:09:39;01:09:41;"Daniel Ralston"
01:09:41;01:09:42;"Oh tight"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"He pointed out to me in an email"
01:09:44;01:09:45;"That"
01:09:45;01:09:46;"Cause you know like"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"Oh okay I know where you're going with this"
01:09:48;01:09:49;"Cause obviously that's a very"
01:09:49;01:09:50;"Like that melody"
01:09:50;01:09:51;"Yeah we talked about this"
01:09:51;01:09:54;"Da da da da da da da da da da"
01:09:54;01:09:57;"Only wanna do bad things to you"
01:09:57;01:09:58;"And"
01:09:58;01:09:59;"And I'm out of my mind"
01:09:59;01:10:00;"Right so he pointed out"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"And I didn't even think about this"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"That that is actually an interpolation"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"These guys have publishing on this song"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Of fastball"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"And 90's band"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"Kind of like a squeeze vibe here"
01:10:12;01:10:13;"Yeah this is a good song"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"Their big hit was The Way"
01:10:14;01:10:15;"This is like their second"
01:10:15;01:10:16;"Right"
01:10:16;01:10:17;"Song"
01:10:17;01:10:21;"Fastball was always a confounding band to me"
01:10:21;01:10:24;"Like who went to a fastball show?"
01:10:24;01:10:28;"Like fastball's playing like the Wiltern in 1998"
01:10:28;01:10:29;"Who's going there?"
01:10:29;01:10:30;"I mean like"
01:10:30;01:10:31;"I don't know"
01:10:31;01:10:32;"Just like"
01:10:32;01:10:33;"Catchy"
01:10:33;01:10:35;"Some regular people"
01:10:35;01:10:36;"Just some good hard working Americans"
01:10:36;01:10:37;"Okay"
01:10:37;01:11:02;"So this is where it comes from"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"Shout out to Daniel Ralston"
01:11:04;01:11:07;"Great call"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"Oh he actually says bad things"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"Oh wow"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"I mean I respect that as a songwriter"
01:11:13;01:11:14;"They"
01:11:14;01:11:15;"Somebody"
01:11:15;01:11:16;"Well sick"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"Not Camilla or Machine Gun Kelly I'm pretty sure"
01:11:18;01:11:19;"But somebody somewhere"
01:11:19;01:11:20;"Was listening to that fastball"
01:11:20;01:11:21;"Or maybe they heard the beat"
01:11:21;01:11:22;"And they started singing something"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"Like oh it kind of sounds like that fastball song"
01:11:24;01:11:25;"And they were like instead of"
01:11:25;01:11:27;"He's saying I never meant to do bad things to you"
01:11:27;01:11:29;"And then they're like"
01:11:29;01:11:30;"Well that sounds kind of"
01:11:30;01:11:33;"That's some Clinton era feel good"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"Bullshit"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"We're about to get President Trump"
01:11:37;01:11:38;"Instead of saying"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"I never meant to do bad things to you"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"I only do"
01:11:42;01:11:44;"I only want to do bad things to you"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"This song"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"Gives me chills"
01:11:48;01:11:51;"But this was a fantasy"
01:11:51;01:11:54;"Truth was a negotiable value"
01:11:54;01:11:57;"The notion of alternative facts"
01:11:57;01:12:00;"Brought the country to a standstill"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"As fascism crept in"
01:12:02;01:12:05;"The Democrats were nowhere to be found"
01:12:05;01:12:08;"They feigned an opposition"
01:12:08;01:12:11;"But this was a fantasy"
01:12:11;01:12:14;"Do you take the red pill or the blue pill?"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"I could do that all day"
01:12:16;01:12:17;"Oh god"
01:12:17;01:12:18;"We probably will"
01:12:18;01:12:19;"Yeah we probably will"
01:12:19;01:12:21;"Probably every single 2017 song will be"
01:12:21;01:12:22;"We're living in the bad things era"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"But this is a fantasy"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"But this was a fantasy"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"So dude last year maybe it was all about"
01:12:27;01:12:28;"In my neighborhood"
01:12:28;01:12:29;"Oh right this year it's all about"
01:12:29;01:12:31;"But this was a fantasy"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"If society even survives long enough"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"To get an Adam Curtis doc"
01:12:35;01:12:36;"Good lord"
01:12:36;01:12:40;"Back to the good old days of Reagan"
01:12:40;01:12:42;"Which was also a bad period"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"Maybe it's always been bad"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"No I would take that in a heartbeat"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"Well you would"
01:12:48;01:12:49;"You didn't have the CIA"
01:12:49;01:12:51;"Flooding your neighborhood with crack"
01:12:51;01:12:52;"Fair"
01:12:52;01:12:55;"Okay Reagan was at least a"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"Rational"
01:12:57;01:12:58;"Sane human"
01:12:58;01:12:59;"Debatable"
01:12:59;01:13:01;"He was a sane human"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"In control of his emotions"
01:13:03;01:13:04;"Anyway let's move on"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"Okay so the number four song"
01:13:06;01:13:07;"When Reagan took office"
01:13:07;01:13:09;"Was Guilty"
01:13:09;01:13:11;"By Barbra Streisand and Barry Gibb"
01:13:11;01:13:12;"I don't know this"
01:13:12;01:13:13;"You know this song?"
01:13:13;01:13:14;"Love Gibb"
01:13:14;01:13:18;"Sounds good"
01:13:18;01:13:25;"This is kind of like the aging Lothario"
01:13:25;01:13:27;"The inauguration's on"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"And he's like"
01:13:29;01:13:30;"That"
01:13:30;01:13:31;"Turns it off"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"Takes a deep pull"
01:13:33;01:13:34;"From the J"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"Puts this on"
01:13:36;01:13:37;"Come here baby"
01:13:37;01:13:41;"Shadows falling baby"
01:13:41;01:13:43;"We stand alone"
01:13:43;01:13:45;"Out on the street"
01:13:45;01:13:46;"Anybody you meet"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"Got a heartache of their own"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"I wouldn't guess that was Barbra Streisand"
01:13:50;01:13:53;"Make it a crime to be lonely"
01:13:53;01:13:56;"I don't even know what Barbra Streisand sounds like"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"I thought she had more of a Brooklyn accent"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"Barbra Streisand's one of those people that like"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"I can't name one song of hers"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"She was like a huge star"
01:14:04;01:14:05;"People love her"
01:14:05;01:14:07;"I don't know one song"
01:14:07;01:14:09;"Is that all show tunes?"
01:14:09;01:14:11;"Yeah I think so"
01:14:11;01:14:13;"Yeah not exactly like a pop artist"
01:14:13;01:14:14;"Yeah"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"Night and day"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"Just a matter of time"
01:14:18;01:14:22;"And we got nothing to be guilty of"
01:14:22;01:14:25;"That's an interesting sentiment for"
01:14:25;01:14:28;"We got nothing to be guilty of"
01:14:28;01:14:31;"Every time a Republican comes into office"
01:14:31;01:14:33;"Like 50% of the country"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"Kind of feels like"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"You know what I'm tired of apologizing"
01:14:37;01:14:38;"Yeah yeah"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"Early 70s Nixon"
01:14:40;01:14:41;"Yeah"
01:14:41;01:14:42;"I mean"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"This is some good late yacht rock"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"Yep"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"The number four song"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"The week"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"Trump came to power"
01:14:52;01:14:53;"Was by our good friends the Chainsmokers"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"I don't know if you have you heard the Chainsmokers new single yet?"
01:14:55;01:14:56;"No"
01:14:56;01:14:57;"I know you've been waiting for it man"
01:14:57;01:15:00;"What context would I possibly hear that in?"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"Office Depot?"
01:15:02;01:15:03;"Yeah not CVS"
01:15:03;01:15:04;"CVS is oldies"
01:15:04;01:15:05;"I was in Office Depot today"
01:15:05;01:15:06;"Really?"
01:15:06;01:15:07;"But they weren't playing Chainsmokers"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"Well maybe you just didn't know it was Chainsmokers"
01:15:09;01:15:11;"Have you heard this song?"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"It's called Paris"
01:15:13;01:15:15;"But this"
01:15:15;01:15:19;"Like the city in Texas"
01:15:19;01:15:21;"We were staying in Paris"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"Good rhyme"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"If I could take this in a shot right now"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"I don't think that we could work this out"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"Out on a terrace"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"I don't know if it's fair but"
01:15:32;01:15:34;"I thought how"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"Could I let you fall by yourself"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"Well I'm wasted with someone else"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"If we go down"
01:15:40;01:15:43;"Then we go down together"
01:15:43;01:15:46;"They'll say you could do anything"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"They'll say that I was clever"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"If we go down"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"Then we go down together"
01:15:52;01:15:55;"We'll get away with everything"
01:15:55;01:15:58;"Let's show them we are better"
01:15:58;01:16:02;"Let's show them we are better"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"This is a very strange drop"
01:16:04;01:16:07;"Let's show them we are better"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"There's the drop"
01:16:09;01:16:10;"No"
01:16:10;01:16:11;"Really?"
01:16:11;01:16:13;"No the part before was the drop"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"Okay I felt like that was the drop"
01:16:15;01:16:18;"I felt like they were doing the verse over the drop"
01:16:18;01:16:21;"We breathe in the air of this small town"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"I wonder what these guys think of Trump"
01:16:23;01:16:26;"I wonder if they're just like fully apolitical"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"They're from New York I bet"
01:16:28;01:16:31;"But I wonder if they're just like ""yeah it's fine whatever"""
01:16:31;01:16:33;"I bet their vibe is kind of like"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"Their tour manager's like"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"""You see this new..."""
01:16:37;01:16:40;"They're just like ""Yo that's crazy man, that's crazy"""
01:16:40;01:16:41;"Yeah"
01:16:41;01:16:42;"Anyway"
01:16:42;01:16:46;"I wonder if the Chainsmokers got an invite to play the INAG"
01:16:46;01:16:47;"Okay you know what?"
01:16:47;01:16:48;"We weren't fair"
01:16:48;01:16:49;"We just found out that the Chainsmokers"
01:16:49;01:16:52;"Denounced Donald Trump at the Ultra Music Festival"
01:16:52;01:16:53;"Last year"
01:16:53;01:16:54;"That's legit"
01:16:54;01:16:55;"No Chainsmokers, those guys are smart"
01:16:55;01:16:59;"They're not gonna play the Trump Inauguration"
01:16:59;01:17:01;"No of course not"
01:17:01;01:17:03;"We didn't talk about that though dude"
01:17:03;01:17:07;"The image of three doors down playing in front of the Lincoln Memorial"
01:17:07;01:17:08;"Oh dude you know what they covered?"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"They covered Smash Mouth"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"No no that was a joke"
01:17:12;01:17:13;"Wait was it?"
01:17:13;01:17:14;"I'm an idiot"
01:17:14;01:17:15;"I'm completely gullible"
01:17:15;01:17:18;"Jake's referring to a video that somebody tweeted at us"
01:17:18;01:17:21;"That was three doors down performing"
01:17:21;01:17:23;"And then somebody just synced it to be"
01:17:23;01:17:24;"Somebody"
01:17:24;01:17:26;"Dude it totally was plausible to me"
01:17:26;01:17:27;"Because I was like"
01:17:27;01:17:30;"What songs are three doors down playing?"
01:17:30;01:17:31;"I don't know"
01:17:31;01:17:32;"It's an alternate universe man"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"They don't have any songs"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"The number three song"
01:17:36;01:17:37;"When Reagan took office"
01:17:37;01:17:38;"This is a classic"
01:17:38;01:17:41;"Remember this one Jake?"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"This is a cover"
01:17:43;01:17:45;"Of a 60's Jamaican record"
01:17:45;01:17:48;"Done by New York City's own Blondie"
01:17:48;01:17:49;"Oh okay"
01:17:49;01:17:50;"Yeah"
01:17:50;01:18:00;"I can totally picture this"
01:18:00;01:18:01;"It's kind of like"
01:18:01;01:18:05;"The new wave teenager at home"
01:18:05;01:18:06;"Just listening to this"
01:18:06;01:18:10;"Mom and dad watching Reagan's inauguration"
01:18:10;01:18:13;"This is the best Blondie song"
01:18:13;01:18:14;"That's cold Jake"
01:18:14;01:18:15;"Because they didn't even write this one"
01:18:15;01:18:16;"I know Blondie sucks"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"But this is their best song"
01:18:18;01:18:19;"Blondie doesn't suck"
01:18:19;01:18:20;"They suck"
01:18:20;01:18:21;"Are you kidding me?"
01:18:21;01:18:23;"Dude didn't we hear Blondie last night"
01:18:23;01:18:25;"When we were at that pizza restaurant after the movie?"
01:18:25;01:18:26;"I don't know"
01:18:26;01:18:27;"Call me"
01:18:27;01:18:28;"And I was just like"
01:18:28;01:18:29;"This is"
01:18:29;01:18:30;"Wow that's dumb man"
01:18:30;01:18:31;"I like Blondie"
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Really you're in?"
01:18:32;01:18:33;"Yeah"
01:18:33;01:18:35;"I feel like Blondie's one of those bands"
01:18:35;01:18:36;"That people were like"
01:18:36;01:18:37;"Oh yeah Blondie's cool"
01:18:37;01:18:38;"Blondie's good"
01:18:38;01:18:39;"They were like"
01:18:39;01:18:40;"You know new wave punk rock"
01:18:40;01:18:41;"But like they suck"
01:18:41;01:18:42;"Their songs suck"
01:18:42;01:18:43;"Jake you're just not as"
01:18:43;01:18:46;"I'm more punk than you I think"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"That's actually an interesting question"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"Because neither of us is very punk"
01:18:50;01:18:53;"I'm more punk than you man"
01:18:53;01:18:54;"In some ways yes"
01:18:54;01:18:56;"In some ways no"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"You're more of a classic rock dude"
01:18:58;01:18:59;"No that's for sure"
01:18:59;01:19:02;"But me I like punk rock"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"And new wave"
01:19:04;01:19:07;"I like many Blondie songs"
01:19:07;01:19:08;"You don't like"
01:19:08;01:19:09;"I think you like punk rock"
01:19:09;01:19:10;"As like a cultural thing"
01:19:10;01:19:11;"I don't think you actually"
01:19:11;01:19:12;"Like listen to punk rock"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"I listen to the Clash"
01:19:14;01:19:15;"Okay that's like a sophisticated"
01:19:15;01:19:17;"Interpretation of punk rock"
01:19:17;01:19:19;"You're not throwing on circle jerks"
01:19:19;01:19:20;"Black Flag"
01:19:20;01:19:21;"I like some circle jerks"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"I like Black Flag"
01:19:23;01:19:24;"Yeah I probably don't listen to it"
01:19:24;01:19:25;"As much these days"
01:19:25;01:19:26;"Yeah of course not"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"You're like a 35 year old man"
01:19:28;01:19:29;"I'm a 32 year old man"
01:19:29;01:19:30;"So obviously I'm listening"
01:19:30;01:19:31;"To a little more jazz"
01:19:31;01:19:32;"A little more Frazier"
01:19:32;01:19:35;"But I'm not listening to quite as much punk rock"
01:19:35;01:19:37;"But no I like punk rock"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"Homeland soundtrack"
01:19:39;01:19:40;"No if Homeland"
01:19:40;01:19:43;"If they made Homeland about me"
01:19:43;01:19:44;"It wouldn't be jazz"
01:19:44;01:19:45;"It'd be punk"
01:19:45;01:19:46;"It'd be post punk"
01:19:47;01:19:48;"Jawbreaker"
01:19:48;01:19:49;"Oscar Dew"
01:19:49;01:19:50;"I like them"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"80's SST catalog"
01:19:52;01:19:53;"I like that"
01:19:53;01:19:54;"I've been listening to Minutemen a lot lately"
01:19:54;01:19:55;"Okay"
01:19:55;01:19:58;"I watch the documentary about them"
01:19:58;01:19:59;"Econo"
01:19:59;01:20:00;"Weejim Econo"
01:20:01;01:20:02;"They weren't even that punk"
01:20:02;01:20:03;"They're kind of"
01:20:03;01:20:04;"They're like very funky"
01:20:04;01:20:05;"I'm really surprised that you say Blondie"
01:20:05;01:20:06;"So I think they're cool"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"I think Debbie Harry is real cool"
01:20:08;01:20:09;"You don't like"
01:20:09;01:20:12;"Their songs are just not that good"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"That's all it is"
01:20:14;01:20:16;"What about Sunday Girl?"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"How's that go?"
01:20:18;01:20:22;"Baby I would like to go out tonight"
01:20:22;01:20:25;"If I go with you my folks will get uptight"
01:20:25;01:20:27;"Run and hide Sunday Girl"
01:20:27;01:20:28;"Yeah"
01:20:28;01:20:29;"I saw your girl"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"Not on a different street"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"Cold as ice cream but still as sweet"
01:20:33;01:20:34;"I like that"
01:20:34;01:20:36;"Cold as ice cream but still as sweet"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"Sounded like your vampire song dude"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"Could be"
01:20:40;01:20:44;"Might have to drop a little ice cream track on LP4"
01:20:44;01:20:47;"Back to the number three song on iTunes"
01:20:47;01:20:51;"The week of Trump's inauguration"
01:20:51;01:20:52;"Migos"
01:20:52;01:20:53;"Bad and Boujee"
01:20:53;01:20:57;"This song was number one on the Billboard charts recently"
01:20:57;01:20:58;"You know this song?"
01:20:58;01:20:59;"No"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"You know who Migos is?"
01:21:01;01:21:02;"Nope"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"We got a whole lot of new money though"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"And young bitches don't trust you"
01:21:06;01:21:07;"Motherfuckers"
01:21:07;01:21:08;"Hey"
01:21:08;01:21:09;"Rain drop"
01:21:09;01:21:10;"Drop top"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"Smoking on Cook and the hotbox"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"Who's Migos?"
01:21:14;01:21:15;"Uh"
01:21:15;01:21:17;"They're from Atlanta"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"I think two of them are brothers"
01:21:19;01:21:21;"Call up the gang and they come and get jank"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"Cry me a river give you a tissue"
01:21:23;01:21:24;"Bad and Boujee"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"Cooking up with the Uzi"
01:21:26;01:21:28;"It's a savage roof"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"We got thuggers and hunter rounds too"
01:21:30;01:21:32;"Bad and Boujee"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"Cooking up with the Uzi"
01:21:34;01:21:36;"It's a savage roof"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"We got thuggers and hunter rounds too"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"Woo woo woo"
01:21:40;01:21:43;"I think he's cooking up drugs with an Uzi"
01:21:43;01:21:45;"What does that mean?"
01:21:45;01:21:47;"I take your pick and shoot you"
01:21:47;01:21:48;"I'm a dog"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"I don't know"
01:21:50;01:21:54;"I think probably he got a part time job working at the Stepin Corporation"
01:21:54;01:21:57;"Who's removing the cocaine from the coca leaf"
01:21:57;01:21:58;"Copy that"
01:21:58;01:21:59;"Jumping me"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"Back rows on me keep me company"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"We did the most"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"Pull up in goals"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"My diamonds a choker"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"We're just hearing that apparently Migos"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"And by the way Migos' first big single"
01:22:11;01:22:14;"At least that I heard was a song called Versace"
01:22:14;01:22:15;"Do you remember that?"
01:22:15;01:22:17;"They became famous for this triplet flow"
01:22:17;01:22:19;"Versace Versace Versace da da da da da da"
01:22:19;01:22:23;"They've consistently been hit makers for a long time"
01:22:23;01:22:27;"So they're a very famous important group"
01:22:27;01:22:29;"And apparently"
01:22:29;01:22:32;"Even at this current juncture"
01:22:32;01:22:35;"Migos were rejected by every late night show"
01:22:35;01:22:38;"Until Donald Glover shouted them out at the Golden Globes"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"When he was winning a Golden Globe for Atlanta"
01:22:40;01:22:43;"He thanked them for making this song"
01:22:43;01:22:45;"And I guess that was enough to"
01:22:45;01:22:49;"You know convince the Jimmy Kimmel's of the world to have him on"
01:22:49;01:22:52;"So despite having songs in the top five"
01:22:52;01:22:55;"Late night was like"
01:22:55;01:22:56;"What was the problem?"
01:22:56;01:22:57;"What were they averse to?"
01:22:57;01:22:58;"I don't know maybe they didn't"
01:22:58;01:22:59;"You know America's a big country"
01:22:59;01:23:02;"Maybe they didn't understand how important Migos is to people"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"Maybe they don't want to know"
01:23:04;01:23:07;"Maybe they look down on them"
01:23:07;01:23:10;"Because of their genre"
01:23:10;01:23:13;"They're worried about their audience being alienated"
01:23:13;01:23:14;"Maybe"
01:23:14;01:23:17;"But the weird thing is that Donald Glover shouting them out"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"Is not going to appeal"
01:23:19;01:23:23;"Or like cross the divide with that segment of the audience"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"That was alienated to begin with"
01:23:25;01:23:28;"Atlanta is watched by many people"
01:23:28;01:23:31;"And it's considered like a prestigious TV show"
01:23:31;01:23:32;"It's a great show"
01:23:33;01:23:36;"You could imagine that there's somebody who doesn't"
01:23:36;01:23:39;"I guess it's funny to imagine somebody loving Atlanta"
01:23:39;01:23:40;"Yeah"
01:23:40;01:23:44;"Who's like deeply deeply unfamiliar with contemporary rap music"
01:23:44;01:23:45;"Well I am"
01:23:45;01:23:47;"Oh so that's you"
01:23:47;01:23:48;"Yeah but I'm not gonna"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"You know Jake if you were the booker at Jimmy Kimmel"
01:23:50;01:23:51;"And I called you and said"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"Jake how about Migos?"
01:23:53;01:23:54;"You'd be like"
01:23:54;01:23:55;"I gotta bump them"
01:23:55;01:23:58;"Don Henley's got a new solo album coming out"
01:23:58;01:23:59;"And then I'd be like"
01:23:59;01:24:00;"Jake I know you don't know them"
01:24:00;01:24:01;"But they're really important"
01:24:01;01:24:02;"They have a lot of hits"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"They're very influential"
01:24:04;01:24:05;"And then you'd be like"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"I mean no if I was the booker"
01:24:07;01:24:08;"You'd be like Spiral Stairs from Pavement"
01:24:08;01:24:10;"Was gonna come through and do an acoustic set"
01:24:10;01:24:13;"Oh my god"
01:24:13;01:24:16;"Yeah J Masks is gonna do an acoustic set"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"No"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"Okay if I was the booker at Jimmy Kimmel though"
01:24:19;01:24:20;"I would be like"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"This is my job to know what's up"
01:24:22;01:24:25;"And it would take about 9 seconds"
01:24:25;01:24:28;"On Google to figure out who Migos was"
01:24:28;01:24:29;"And that they had top 5 singles"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"Yeah I agree that's strange"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"Like who knows maybe there's more to this story"
01:24:33;01:24:34;"That's insane"
01:24:34;01:24:38;"I mean look the kind of racist resentment"
01:24:38;01:24:41;"Of rap that talks about"
01:24:41;01:24:42;"Or rap period"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"Let alone rap that talks about drugs and weapons"
01:24:44;01:24:47;"You know that goes deep"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"Was only"
01:24:48;01:24:49;"Sure"
01:24:49;01:24:50;"Back in the Reagan era"
01:24:50;01:24:51;"When you had all these"
01:24:51;01:24:53;"The old rockers"
01:24:53;01:24:56;"Saying stuff like rap is crap"
01:24:56;01:24:57;"Who was saying that?"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"I remember watching like some VH1 show as a kid"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"I think it was like"
01:25:01;01:25:02;"I mean I feel bad"
01:25:02;01:25:05;"It was like some dude from like the Allman Brothers or something"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"They would like do some interview in the 80's"
01:25:07;01:25:08;"Be like"
01:25:08;01:25:09;"Hey Dickie"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"What do you think about rap?"
01:25:11;01:25:12;"And be like"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"Rap?"
01:25:13;01:25:14;"Rap is crap"
01:25:14;01:25:17;"Lord I was born a ramblin' man"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"Just some goofball"
01:25:19;01:25:23;"Now Nick's showing me an article on Breitbart"
01:25:23;01:25:26;"A horrible website written by Ben Shapiro"
01:25:26;01:25:27;"Huge idiot"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"Who's Ben Shapiro?"
01:25:29;01:25:30;"He's this conservative right?"
01:25:30;01:25:32;"He's truly a moron"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"How old is he you think?"
01:25:33;01:25:34;"30's?"
01:25:34;01:25:35;"He's in his 30's"
01:25:35;01:25:36;"And the article is called ""Rap is Crap"""
01:25:36;01:25:39;"I don't understand people in their 30's that are like"
01:25:39;01:25:41;"Writing for Breitbart"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"It's like what are you doing dude?"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"Just being a scumbag man"
01:25:44;01:25:45;"A lot of scumbags out there"
01:25:45;01:25:46;"Jesus"
01:25:46;01:25:48;"Alright let's go back to"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"1981"
01:25:50;01:25:52;"The number 2 song"
01:25:52;01:25:54;"Was ""Love on the Rocks"" by Neil Diamond"
01:25:54;01:25:55;"This is interesting to me"
01:25:55;01:25:58;"It's in the top 5 of 1981"
01:25:58;01:26:02;"You got Barbra Streisand, Barry Gibb and Neil Diamond?"
01:26:02;01:26:03;"Yeah"
01:26:03;01:26:07;"It's called ""Love on the Rocks"" from the Jazz Singer soundtrack"
01:26:07;01:26:12;"Love on the rocks"
01:26:12;01:26:15;"Ain't no surprise"
01:26:15;01:26:19;"Just pour me a drink"
01:26:19;01:26:22;"And I'll tell you some lies"
01:26:24;01:26:27;"Got nothing to lose"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"So you just sing the blues"
01:26:29;01:26:32;"All the time"
01:26:32;01:26:41;"Gave you my heart"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"Now presenting"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"President Ronald Reagan"
01:26:45;01:26:48;"And First Lady Nancy Reagan"
01:26:48;01:26:53;"As they take the floor at the inaugural ball"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"For their first dance"
01:26:55;01:26:59;"As the leader of the free world"
01:26:59;01:27:02;"Vice President George Bush"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"Looking on"
01:27:04;01:27:15;"Reagan's first term was definitely kind of like the end of like a certain type of American liberalism"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"Oh yeah"
01:27:17;01:27:18;"I wonder"
01:27:18;01:27:21;"You think W was at this inauguration?"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"I bet he was"
01:27:23;01:27:26;"Yeah W is like"
01:27:26;01:27:29;"My dad's Vice President"

01:27:38;01:27:40;"And his dad's becoming the VP"
01:27:40;01:27:42;"Hadn't been saved yet"

01:28:26;01:28:27;"Oh yeah"
01:28:27;01:28:28;"He wrote Red Red Wine"
01:28:28;01:28:29;"Yeah"
01:28:29;01:28:30;"Beautiful song"
01:28:30;01:28:33;"So the number two song on iTunes"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"The week of Trump becoming President"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"Is called I Don't Want to Live Forever"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"As I'm sure you know Jake"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"It's by Zane and Taylor Swift"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"And it's from the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack"
01:28:43;01:28:44;"News to me bro"
01:28:44;01:28:46;"Did you see the first Fifty Shades movie?"
01:28:46;01:28:48;"No although I heard part of the audio book"
01:28:48;01:28:52;"In my girlfriend's Prius"
01:28:52;01:28:53;"Okay"
01:28:53;01:28:56;"We were driving from Austin to LA about a year ago"
01:28:56;01:28:58;"Yeah and she was listening to it?"
01:28:58;01:29:01;"We were alternating between the Keith Richards memoir"
01:29:01;01:29:04;"And Fifty Shades audio book"
01:29:04;01:29:07;"Well this song's called I Don't Want to Live Forever"
01:29:07;01:29:08;"I want to point something out"
01:29:08;01:29:10;"The top five songs on iTunes this week"
01:29:10;01:29:12;"When Trump became President"
01:29:12;01:29:14;"Two of them have bad in the title"
01:29:14;01:29:16;"Bad things and bad and bougie"
01:29:16;01:29:19;"One was a bittersweet ballad called Paris"
01:29:19;01:29:22;"And this one is called I Don't Want to Live Forever"
01:29:22;01:29:25;"Let's give it a listen"
01:29:25;01:29:29;"So who is this?"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"Zane and Taylor Swift?"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"Teaming up for the first time"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"So Zane is from Backstreet Boys"
01:29:34;01:29:35;"That's right"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"I mean the other, you know, the English version"
01:29:37;01:29:38;"Yeah that's right"
01:29:38;01:29:39;"I'm not going to tell you what it is"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"New edition, no"
01:29:41;01:29:42;"No"
01:29:42;01:29:46;"Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"Hoping you'll come"
01:29:48;01:29:52;"It's just a cruel existence"
01:29:52;01:29:56;"Like it's no point hoping at all"
01:29:56;01:30:00;"Baby baby"
01:30:00;01:30:01;"I feel crazy"
01:30:01;01:30:04;"Up all night, all night"
01:30:04;01:30:06;"And every day"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"Give me something"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"But you say nothing"
01:30:10;01:30:12;"What is happening to me?"
01:30:12;01:30:17;"I don't want to live forever"
01:30:17;01:30:20;"Cause I know I'll be living in vain"
01:30:20;01:30:25;"And I don't want to fit wherever"
01:30:25;01:30:28;"I just want to keep calling your name"
01:30:28;01:30:31;"Until you come back home"
01:30:31;01:30:36;"I just want to keep calling your name"
01:30:36;01:30:37;"Until you come back home"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"Very slow song"
01:30:39;01:30:41;"What do you think so far, Jake?"
01:30:41;01:30:42;"I don't know"
01:30:42;01:30:44;"That was kind of Mumford and Sons style right there, right?"
01:30:44;01:30:45;"The woah-woahs?"
01:30:45;01:30:46;"Yeah"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"Woah-woahs are kind of like a classic, yeah"
01:30:48;01:30:50;"Or it's like a Toyota ad or something"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"Yeah, woah-woah!"
01:30:52;01:30:53;"And I'm not judging anybody else"
01:30:53;01:30:55;"I'm a little over woah-woah, woah-woahs"
01:30:55;01:30:58;"Yeah, it seems tired"
01:30:58;01:31:02;"Well, I think when Mumford and Coldplay first started doing it"
01:31:02;01:31:04;"It hadn't been done in a long time"
01:31:04;01:31:07;"So it was kind of like, yeah, I like to hear people just like"
01:31:07;01:31:08;"Yeah"
01:31:08;01:31:10;"They're so excited and the feeling is so powerful"
01:31:10;01:31:11;"They can't even come up with words"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"Just woah, woah"
01:31:13;01:31:14;"Yeah"
01:31:14;01:31:17;"You know, but now in 2017, it's like, use your words"
01:31:17;01:31:20;"This feels like boilerplate"
01:31:20;01:31:21;"Like, we just need something there"
01:31:21;01:31:22;"Let's put that in"
01:31:22;01:31:25;"Like, back in the day when like a soul singer or somebody"
01:31:25;01:31:26;"Just had to go in a woah"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"It's because the feeling was overpowering"
01:31:28;01:31:29;"Yeah"
01:31:29;01:31:30;"You could feel it"
01:31:30;01:31:31;"Well, it was improvised"
01:31:31;01:31:32;"It felt improvised"
01:31:32;01:31:34;"This is very canned"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"So what are these lyrics about, though?"
01:31:36;01:31:38;"He doesn't want to live forever because he doesn't want to be in pain?"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"It's something like, I don't want to live forever"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"Because I'd be living in vain"
01:31:42;01:31:43;"I guess like without you"
01:31:43;01:31:47;"And I'm going to wait until you come back home or something"
01:31:47;01:31:49;"And then Taylor drops in, second verse"
01:31:49;01:31:50;"Oh, yeah, you want to hear it?"
01:31:50;01:31:51;"Leather and lace"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"I'm sitting eyes wide open"
01:31:53;01:31:57;"I got one thing stuck in my mind"
01:31:57;01:32:01;"Wondering if I dodged a bullet"
01:32:01;01:32:05;"Or just lost the love of my life"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"Oh"
01:32:07;01:32:09;"Baby, baby"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"I feel crazy"
01:32:11;01:32:12;"I like that part"
01:32:12;01:32:15;"All night and every day"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"I gave you something"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"But you gave me nothing"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"What is happening to me?"
01:32:21;01:32:26;"I don't want to live forever"
01:32:26;01:32:29;"'Cause I know I'd be living in pain"
01:32:29;01:32:31;"And I don't want to live forever"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"Okay, I think I understand what the song is about"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"Zayn and Taylor broke up"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"Oh, they were a couple?"
01:32:37;01:32:38;"No, in the song"
01:32:38;01:32:39;"Okay"
01:32:39;01:32:40;"In the song"
01:32:40;01:32:42;"They broke up and each one of them"
01:32:42;01:32:44;"Is having a sleepless night"
01:32:44;01:32:46;"Eyes wide open"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"Thoughts running through their head"
01:32:48;01:32:49;"You know, they're taking it from slightly different angles"
01:32:49;01:32:52;"They're just like, broke up, I feel crazy"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"Was it a good idea?"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"So then they're both saying"
01:32:56;01:32:58;"I feel so weird right now"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"Being without you"
01:33:00;01:33:03;"That even though I used to want to live forever"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"I don't anymore"
01:33:05;01:33:08;"Because I'd just be calling your name"
01:33:08;01:33:11;"In a futile attempt to get you to come back home"
01:33:11;01:33:12;"For eternity"
01:33:13;01:33:14;"I don't want to live forever"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"I mean, you weren't going to live forever in the first place"
01:33:16;01:33:17;"That's why I'm sort of like"
01:33:17;01:33:18;"Let's keep it real, yeah"
01:33:18;01:33:19;"It's kind of a dumb idea"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"That's not on the menu"
01:33:21;01:33:24;"You living forever"
01:33:24;01:33:27;"It's not Burger King, you can't have it your way"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"My gym teacher always used to say that to us"
01:33:29;01:33:30;"What?"
01:33:30;01:33:32;"My gym teacher always used to say"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"He always used to say"
01:33:34;01:33:35;"Like somebody would be like"
01:33:35;01:33:38;"Yo coach, can we count three pointers"
01:33:38;01:33:40;"In the gym class basketball game today?"
01:33:40;01:33:41;"No"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"Every basket counts as one"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"Yeah, but come on, can't we do it more like NBA style?"
01:33:45;01:33:46;"Hey, it's not Burger King"
01:33:46;01:33:49;"Can't have it your way"
01:33:49;01:33:50;"Wow"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"Like, can me and Rob be on the same team?"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"It's not Burger King"
01:33:54;01:33:55;"You can't have it your way"
01:33:55;01:33:58;"That's funny coach, because I didn't think that I could have it my way at Burger King"
01:33:58;01:34:02;"I thought I went in there and I just got the burger under the heat lamp"
01:34:02;01:34:05;"You know what, the more I think about it, it's so depressing"
01:34:05;01:34:08;"It's like, listen kids"
01:34:08;01:34:14;"In terms of freedom, the high water mark in your existence is Burger King"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"And this sure as hell is not that"
01:34:16;01:34:20;"We're about ten steps below the freedom of choice"
01:34:20;01:34:23;"You young consumer have at Burger King"
01:34:23;01:34:24;"And this is gym class"
01:34:24;01:34:26;"This is boot camp"
01:34:26;01:34:30;"If you thought at your public school gym class"
01:34:30;01:34:33;"You were going to have the dazzling array of options"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"One has at Burger King"
01:34:35;01:34:39;"You my friend are sadly mistaken"
01:34:39;01:34:43;"This song would have been good for maybe the Highlander movie series"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"Where Living Forever is on the table"
01:34:45;01:34:46;"I know, wait"
01:34:46;01:34:47;"Well maybe, okay"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"That series always messed with me"
01:34:49;01:34:50;"Because like"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"You can live forever unless you get your head cut off"
01:34:52;01:34:53;"You know what's crazy, man?"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"Sometimes I think about that series"
01:34:55;01:34:58;"And I'm like, I'm aging, my friends are aging"
01:34:58;01:35:00;"Family members are aging"
01:35:00;01:35:01;"And then I have this fantasy"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"I'm like, what if I was a Highlander"
01:35:03;01:35:06;"And I was like, permanently 39 years old"
01:35:06;01:35:09;"I'd be in this situation where all my friends were like"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"You know, being in their mid-40s"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"And then turning 50 and I'm still 39"
01:35:13;01:35:18;"I'd have to like, somehow extricate myself from my entire life"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"Because it would get weird that I wasn't aging"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"I have fantasies about this"
01:35:22;01:35:23;"Yeah, no, picture that like"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"You'd have to like, you'd have to leave"
01:35:25;01:35:26;"Yeah, no like"
01:35:26;01:35:27;"You'd have to like, disappear"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"Say like in 50 years, I'm 82"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"And you're still 39"
01:35:31;01:35:34;"And you're kicking it with all people in their 30s and stuff"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"Or like a new crew every like 5 years"
01:35:36;01:35:38;"You got a new crew because you're going to barbecues and stuff"
01:35:38;01:35:41;"You're not going to want to come hang out at the nursing home"
01:35:41;01:35:42;"You know what also, this"
01:35:42;01:35:43;"I don't want to live forever, man"
01:35:43;01:35:46;"This song also might have made more sense for Twilight"
01:35:46;01:35:47;"Because the vampires"
01:35:47;01:35:48;"Actually, Twilight's really sad"
01:35:48;01:35:52;"Because that's a lot of the tension of that epic film series"
01:35:52;01:35:53;"And the novel series"
01:35:53;01:35:56;"Was about literally what you're talking about"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"You fall in love with somebody"
01:35:58;01:36:00;"Who's mortal"
01:36:00;01:36:01;"Who's mortal"
01:36:01;01:36:02;"Well guess what"
01:36:02;01:36:04;"In 50 years"
01:36:04;01:36:07;"Kristen Stewart is going to be an old lady"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"And you're going to look exactly the same"
01:36:09;01:36:11;"Are you still going to love her?"
01:36:11;01:36:14;"When she's no longer young and beautiful?"
01:36:14;01:36:15;"But also to be fair"
01:36:15;01:36:18;"Neither one of us have seen 50 Shades Darker"
01:36:18;01:36:19;"That's true"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"Perhaps there's an element in the film"
01:36:21;01:36:24;"That would make us understand the song better"
01:36:24;01:36:26;"That would explain that"
01:36:26;01:36:28;"That living forever is an option"
01:36:28;01:36:29;"Okay but also"
01:36:29;01:36:31;"I'm trying to be charitable here"
01:36:31;01:36:32;"I want to be charitable"
01:36:32;01:36:34;"Here's another interpretation that actually makes sense"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"As you said"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"None of us will live forever"
01:36:38;01:36:39;"However"
01:36:39;01:36:40;"Sometimes"
01:36:40;01:36:42;"In a nice moment in life"
01:36:42;01:36:46;"You might fantasize about living forever"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"So even though you know you can't live forever"
01:36:48;01:36:50;"On a spring day"
01:36:50;01:36:53;"Indoors watching Frasier with your girlfriend"
01:36:53;01:36:54;"You might be like"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"I wish this moment could last forever"
01:36:56;01:36:58;"Just a beautiful spring day"
01:36:58;01:36:59;"The sun"
01:36:59;01:37:00;"Sun's out"
01:37:00;01:37:01;"You know me"
01:37:01;01:37:04;"I love watching TV on a beautiful spring day"
01:37:04;01:37:06;"You're inside with the shades down"
01:37:06;01:37:07;"Watching Frasier"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"And you say I wish this could last forever"
01:37:09;01:37:10;"So I guess you could say"
01:37:10;01:37:11;"That these people are saying"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"You know I used to imagine living forever"
01:37:13;01:37:14;"Right"
01:37:14;01:37:17;"And now I don't even want to imagine it anymore"
01:37:17;01:37:18;"That makes sense"
01:37:18;01:37:20;"Okay dude I'm picturing us"
01:37:20;01:37:23;"At like 2 o'clock on a weekday at Arclight"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"Watching Fifty Shades Darker"
01:37:25;01:37:27;"Time Crisis Research"
01:37:27;01:37:29;"On a beautiful spring day"
01:37:29;01:37:30;"Love it"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"Ezra it's like 72 with a light breeze"
01:37:32;01:37:34;"How about we meet at the Arclight"
01:37:34;01:37:37;"And sit in a dark room and watch Fifty Shades Darker"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"You know I've been wanting to check out that movie"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"Ever since"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"Our conversation about the lyrics"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"To the lead single from the soundtrack"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"Is that just like the credit song?"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"Who knows"
01:37:49;01:37:54;"Vampire Weekend we did a song for one of the Twilight movies"
01:37:54;01:37:56;"Oh really?"
01:37:56;01:37:57;"Yeah"
01:37:57;01:37:59;"Like off your album or wrote a song for it?"
01:37:59;01:38:01;"It's like a really random song"
01:38:01;01:38:02;"Not on your album"
01:38:02;01:38:03;"No"
01:38:03;01:38:04;"Albums"
01:38:04;01:38:05;"It's called Jonathan Lowe"
01:38:05;01:38:06;"It's actually probably the least"
01:38:06;01:38:07;"What?"
01:38:07;01:38:08;"The least known Vampire Weekend song"
01:38:08;01:38:09;"I don't know it"
01:38:09;01:38:10;"I haven't listened to it in a long time"
01:38:10;01:38:11;"And I don't really want to"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"Jonathan Lowe?"
01:38:13;01:38:14;"Yeah it's a song"
01:38:14;01:38:15;"I started writing it like in high school"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"And then they were kind of like"
01:38:17;01:38:18;"It's weird"
01:38:18;01:38:19;"It's kind of like"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"It's almost like an early U2 song or something"
01:38:21;01:38:22;"You gotta throw this on"
01:38:22;01:38:23;"Alright"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"Let's see if it's in"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"Jonathan Lowe like"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"That's a dude's name?"
01:38:29;01:38:30;"I don't know"
01:38:30;01:38:31;"It's like I was in high school"
01:38:31;01:38:32;"And I was just kind of"
01:38:32;01:38:33;"W-E?"
01:38:33;01:38:34;"Like Rob Lowe?"
01:38:34;01:38:35;"And I was just kind of like writing"
01:38:35;01:38:36;"A"
01:38:36;01:38:38;"Why did you resurrect a song from high school?"
01:38:38;01:38:40;"It was just sort of like"
01:38:40;01:38:41;"You were just like"
01:38:41;01:38:42;"This is a dope"
01:38:42;01:38:44;"Inspired"
01:38:44;01:38:46;"Chord progression?"
01:38:46;01:38:47;"What was"
01:38:47;01:38:48;"I mean"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"I think basically we had the opportunity"
01:38:50;01:38:51;"And"
01:38:51;01:38:52;"This was a song"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"I always kind of liked this song"
01:38:54;01:38:55;"And then"
01:38:55;01:38:57;"You know we took it to the next level"
01:38:57;01:39:01;"This is it?"
01:39:01;01:39:02;"Yeah"
01:39:02;01:39:07;"Oh yeah"
01:39:07;01:39:08;"Rustem added like"
01:39:08;01:39:10;"Kind of like a Fleetwood Mac vibe?"
01:39:10;01:39:11;"Or like"
01:39:11;01:39:12;"You know what?"
01:39:12;01:39:13;"I feel like me and Rustem"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"Are like the Beatles or something"
01:39:15;01:39:20;"This is tight"
01:39:20;01:39:22;"I totally forgot about this song"
01:39:22;01:39:24;"He lived inside a house"
01:39:24;01:39:27;"Beneath a hanging tree"
01:39:27;01:39:30;"London derry nights"
01:39:30;01:39:33;"They chilled into the boat"
01:39:33;01:39:36;"It was a crowded night"
01:39:36;01:39:40;"In unforgiving tones"
01:39:40;01:39:43;"Blood of his men"
01:39:43;01:39:46;"Was gone from its stone"
01:39:46;01:39:49;"He picked up his knife"
01:39:49;01:39:51;"And his bow"
01:39:51;01:39:54;"Killed a child in the love"
01:39:54;01:40:02;"This part really doesn't sound like Vampire Weekend"
01:40:02;01:40:03;"Pretty lo-fi"
01:40:03;01:40:14;"Dude that tone is pretty Jerry"
01:40:14;01:40:15;"We do do"
01:40:18;01:40:21;"Violence from without"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"You know what I mean about early U2?"
01:40:23;01:40:24;"Yeah yeah yeah"
01:40:24;01:40:25;"For sure"
01:40:25;01:40:27;"I will follow"
01:40:27;01:40:28;"Yeah yeah"
01:40:28;01:40:31;"Be-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de"
01:40:31;01:40:34;"They all took the facts"
01:40:34;01:40:37;"They all knew his name"
01:40:37;01:40:40;"And if he could return"
01:40:40;01:40:43;"The property would stay"
01:40:43;01:40:46;"Blood of his friends"
01:40:46;01:40:49;"Was gone from his stone"
01:40:49;01:40:52;"For all that I know"
01:40:52;01:40:53;"I like that"
01:40:53;01:40:54;"He died"
01:40:54;01:40:56;"Killed a child in the love"
01:40:56;01:40:57;"Ross put in some bells, you hear that?"
01:40:57;01:40:58;"Yeah yeah"
01:40:58;01:41:02;"Classic CT here"
01:41:02;01:41:05;"Sick drum fills"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"I'm not mad at this actually"
01:41:17;01:41:18;"It doesn't sound like"
01:41:18;01:41:21;"That much like Vampire Weekend to me but"
01:41:21;01:41:28;"It rocks harder"
01:41:28;01:41:30;"Than most Vampire stuff"
01:41:30;01:41:34;"That's pretty classic that Ross Evans harpsichord"
01:41:34;01:41:35;"Yeah"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"Kinda like first album vibe"
01:41:38;01:41:39;"Ba-na-na-na"
01:41:39;01:41:52;"Oh yeah this part's good"
01:41:52;01:41:53;"This part's tight"
01:41:53;01:41:54;"Yeah"
01:41:54;01:41:56;"You think we should bring this back in the setlist?"
01:41:56;01:41:58;"Let's do this part for like five minutes"
01:41:58;01:41:59;"Right"
01:41:59;01:42:03;"Have John Mayer come on stage and just solo over it dude"
01:42:14;01:42:15;"Interesting"
01:42:15;01:42:17;"Dude that'd be tight if like"
01:42:17;01:42:19;"The next series of vampire shows"
01:42:19;01:42:22;"Like your first show out you just open with Jonathan Lowe"
01:42:22;01:42:25;"Just like blow the"
01:42:25;01:42:27;"Like blow the heads"
01:42:27;01:42:29;"Mind"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"Blow the heads minds that's a weird phrase"
01:42:31;01:42:32;"I mean"
01:42:32;01:42:33;"All the vampire heads would just be like"
01:42:33;01:42:34;"Open with"
01:42:34;01:42:35;"Dude imagine if vampire"
01:42:35;01:42:38;"Like started to have setlists that were just like crazy unpredictable"
01:42:38;01:42:39;"Like it was like a fish show"
01:42:39;01:42:40;"I wanna do that"
01:42:40;01:42:41;"And just sort of like"
01:42:41;01:42:42;"Dude they open with Jonathan Lowe man"
01:42:42;01:42:44;"They never played it live before"
01:42:44;01:42:47;"No I've always known that starting on the fourth album"
01:42:47;01:42:50;"Which yes is getting worked on everyday"
01:42:50;01:42:52;"Cause you know the first three albums"
01:42:52;01:42:53;"It's like we still"
01:42:53;01:42:55;"Like we really had to"
01:42:55;01:42:56;"Just nail the show"
01:42:56;01:42:57;"You know"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"It's like we didn't wanna like switch up the setlist too much"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"Especially for me it's still like getting used to like singing on the road"
01:43:01;01:43:02;"Mmhm"
01:43:02;01:43:04;"Fourth album it's time to like"
01:43:04;01:43:05;"Get a little work"
01:43:05;01:43:06;"Wild out dude"
01:43:06;01:43:07;"You know it's"
01:43:07;01:43:08;"No setlist style to show up like"
01:43:08;01:43:09;"I feel like people don't"
01:43:09;01:43:10;"Well"
01:43:10;01:43:11;"What do you guys wanna hear?"
01:43:11;01:43:13;"You know what the song that people used to request"
01:43:13;01:43:14;"It was not this one"
01:43:14;01:43:16;"But another movie soundtrack song called Ottoman"
01:43:16;01:43:17;"You know that one?"
01:43:17;01:43:18;"No"
01:43:18;01:43:19;"It was on this"
01:43:19;01:43:20;"From this movie"
01:43:20;01:43:22;"Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist"
01:43:22;01:43:23;"It was a Michael Cera movie"
01:43:23;01:43:26;"That's probably our most beloved soundtrack"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"Work"
01:43:28;01:43:30;"Wait how many soundtrack songs have you done"
01:43:30;01:43:31;"On albums?"
01:43:31;01:43:33;"Uh maybe just those two"
01:43:33;01:43:34;"Okay"
01:43:34;01:43:35;"Coachella 2018"
01:43:35;01:43:38;"Jonathan Lowe"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"Open with Jonathan Lowe dude"
01:43:40;01:43:42;"Just played Jonathan Lowe four times in a row"
01:43:42;01:43:45;"So anyway that was a fun detour"
01:43:45;01:43:46;"Let's get back to the top five"
01:43:46;01:43:47;"Yep"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"And also think about Frasier before"
01:43:49;01:43:51;"Let's not be too hard on I Don't Wanna Live Forever"
01:43:51;01:43:52;"Because"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"When that comes across your desk"
01:43:54;01:43:55;"This opportunity to make a song"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"For something amazing like Frasier or Twilight"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"Or Fifty Shades Darker"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"It's not the easiest thing in the world"
01:44:01;01:44:03;"To like make something that thematically fits"
01:44:03;01:44:05;"And you know what I mean?"
01:44:05;01:44:07;"Sure"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"Not really"
01:44:09;01:44:12;"You gotta capture the spirit of the film"
01:44:12;01:44:13;"And also say something"
01:44:13;01:44:15;"Whatever"
01:44:15;01:44:17;"I don't think any of those songs capture"
01:44:17;01:44:18;"I haven't seen Twilight"
01:44:18;01:44:20;"I haven't seen Fifty Shades Darker"
01:44:20;01:44:21;"I probably never will"
01:44:21;01:44:23;"Really?"
01:44:23;01:44:25;"And the Frasier thing"
01:44:25;01:44:28;"Why just because President Trump makes the future seem so bleak"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"That you can't even imagine"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"Yourself getting to enjoy these films?"
01:44:32;01:44:34;"I have only so many hours in the day"
01:44:34;01:44:35;"Whatever man"
01:44:35;01:44:37;"The number one song"
01:44:37;01:44:38;"I gotta watch Homeland dude"
01:44:38;01:44:39;"I can't be messing around"
01:44:39;01:44:40;"Don't watch Homeland man"
01:44:40;01:44:41;"That's racist"
01:44:41;01:44:43;"Fifty Shades Darker might be racist too"
01:44:43;01:44:44;"I don't know"
01:44:44;01:44:45;"I'll have to go see and find out"
01:44:45;01:44:47;"Don't quote me on that"
01:44:47;01:44:49;"The number one song"
01:44:49;01:44:50;"Reagan"
01:44:50;01:44:51;"Now this is messed up"
01:44:51;01:44:52;"I mean"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"There's no point in comparing"
01:44:54;01:44:55;"Like we're truly"
01:44:55;01:44:56;"We're living in dark times now"
01:44:56;01:44:57;"Yeah"
01:44:57;01:44:58;"I know people don't appreciate"
01:44:58;01:44:59;"When people try to say"
01:44:59;01:45:00;"Oh well now it's horrible"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"And things might be getting worse than ever"
01:45:02;01:45:03;"But you know what?"
01:45:03;01:45:04;"Bad things have happened"
01:45:04;01:45:05;"Like who cares?"
01:45:05;01:45:06;"Yes"
01:45:06;01:45:07;"Bad things happen"
01:45:07;01:45:08;"You gotta deal with them"
01:45:08;01:45:09;"And you know"
01:45:09;01:45:10;"It's like when you're depressed"
01:45:10;01:45:11;"And somebody says"
01:45:11;01:45:12;"Yeah but you know"
01:45:12;01:45:13;"Like in a couple weeks"
01:45:13;01:45:14;"You might be psyched"
01:45:14;01:45:15;"Who cares?"
01:45:15;01:45:16;"You gotta deal with things as they come"
01:45:16;01:45:17;"But anyway"
01:45:17;01:45:19;"Not to make a comparison"
01:45:19;01:45:20;"To make us feel better"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"But just to draw a connection"
01:45:22;01:45:24;"When Reagan took office"
01:45:24;01:45:25;"Was also a deeply messed up time"
01:45:25;01:45:26;"Remember how last year"
01:45:26;01:45:27;"Everybody kept being like"
01:45:27;01:45:28;"2016 is the worst year ever"
01:45:28;01:45:29;"Yeah"
01:45:29;01:45:30;"And now we're entering"
01:45:30;01:45:31;"Perhaps an even worse year"
01:45:31;01:45:33;"Just picture this"
01:45:33;01:45:34;"You're a"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"Peace-neck hippie type"
01:45:36;01:45:38;"It's late 1980"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"November comes"
01:45:40;01:45:43;"You're kinda crunchy-ish"
01:45:43;01:45:44;"President Carter"
01:45:44;01:45:46;"Gets his ass handed to him"
01:45:46;01:45:49;"By these new energized Republicans"
01:45:49;01:45:50;"Led by Ronald Reagan"
01:45:50;01:45:52;"You're in this new era"
01:45:52;01:45:53;"The 80s"
01:45:53;01:45:54;"And you're like holy"
01:45:54;01:45:55;"Oh my god is the 80s gonna suck?"
01:45:55;01:45:57;"We're gonna have President Reagan"
01:45:57;01:45:59;"Man"
01:45:59;01:46:00;"The actor?"
01:46:00;01:46:01;"The actor"
01:46:01;01:46:02;"Like that sucks"
01:46:02;01:46:04;"I really thought by now"
01:46:04;01:46:07;"The hippies would've like fully won"
01:46:07;01:46:09;"Now I see all my"
01:46:09;01:46:10;"It's 1980"
01:46:10;01:46:11;"It would've felt regressive"
01:46:11;01:46:12;"Yeah and you imagine you're like"
01:46:12;01:46:13;"A summer of love type dude"
01:46:13;01:46:15;"And like now it's 1980"
01:46:15;01:46:17;"And you're like"
01:46:17;01:46:19;"Not only did the liberals like lose"
01:46:19;01:46:22;"But a lot of my hippie brothers and sisters"
01:46:22;01:46:23;"Are becoming yuppies"
01:46:24;01:46:25;"Selling out"
01:46:25;01:46:26;"They're getting jobs"
01:46:26;01:46:27;"Eating Haagen Dazs"
01:46:27;01:46:28;"And you're just like man"
01:46:28;01:46:29;"Could it get any worse"
01:46:29;01:46:31;"For me, a former hippie?"
01:46:31;01:46:33;"Well I got news for you man"
01:46:33;01:46:35;"December 8th, 1980"
01:46:35;01:46:37;"John Lennon murdered"
01:46:37;01:46:38;"Oh"
01:46:38;01:46:40;"Just imagine that few months"
01:46:40;01:46:41;"Right"
01:46:41;01:46:42;"Like that's crazy"
01:46:42;01:46:43;"So like Reagan wins"
01:46:43;01:46:46;"Ugh, November of '80"
01:46:46;01:46:47;"A few weeks later"
01:46:47;01:46:49;"Lennon gets murdered"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"So the number one song"
01:46:51;01:46:52;"When Reagan took office"
01:46:52;01:46:53;"Imagine?"
01:46:53;01:46:54;"No, it was his last single"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"Which"
01:46:56;01:46:57;"Watching the wheels?"
01:46:57;01:46:58;"No, this is like weird"
01:46:58;01:47:00;"It's uncomfortable"
01:47:00;01:47:01;"But you know his last single was called"
01:47:01;01:47:03;"It'll Be Just Like Starting Over"
01:47:03;01:47:04;"Oh"
01:47:04;01:47:05;"Which is so brutal"
01:47:05;01:47:06;"Because to me"
01:47:06;01:47:07;"Whoa"
01:47:07;01:47:08;"This song is from his last album"
01:47:08;01:47:09;"And this song was"
01:47:09;01:47:11;"Starting over"
01:47:11;01:47:12;"This song is kind of like"
01:47:12;01:47:13;"I think"
01:47:13;01:47:14;"Well let's listen to it"
01:47:14;01:47:15;"I think it's about like a couple"
01:47:15;01:47:16;"Being like look"
01:47:16;01:47:17;"Some messed up things have happened between us"
01:47:17;01:47:18;"But you know what"
01:47:18;01:47:19;"We're still here"
01:47:19;01:47:20;"We're still alive"
01:47:20;01:47:21;"We're still together"
01:47:21;01:47:22;"Let's do it"
01:47:22;01:47:23;"It'll be just like starting over"
01:47:23;01:47:24;"Yeah"
01:47:24;01:47:25;"We can like start from scratch"
01:47:25;01:47:27;"So imagine this"
01:47:27;01:47:29;"This murdered"
01:47:29;01:47:30;"Ugh"
01:47:30;01:47:31;"Songwriter"
01:47:31;01:47:32;"Is number one on the charts"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"An icon of the 1960s"
01:47:34;01:47:35;"Right"
01:47:35;01:47:36;"Reagan just took office"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"Woo"
01:47:38;01:47:39;"We have grown"
01:47:39;01:47:44;"We have grown"
01:47:44;01:47:48;"Although our love"
01:47:48;01:47:51;"Is still special"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"Let's take a chance"
01:47:54;01:47:56;"And fly away"
01:47:56;01:47:59;"Somewhere"
01:47:59;01:48:02;"Alone"
01:48:02;01:48:07;"It's been too long"
01:48:07;01:48:08;"We've took the time"
01:48:08;01:48:09;"No one's been there"
01:48:09;01:48:10;"It's kind of a throwback song"
01:48:10;01:48:11;"Yeah totally"
01:48:11;01:48:18;"But when I see you darling"
01:48:19;01:48:22;"It's like we both are falling in love again"
01:48:22;01:48:28;"It'll be just like starting over"
01:48:28;01:48:33;"Starting over"
01:48:33;01:48:39;"Everything used to make it look white"
01:48:39;01:48:43;"Can't you make it look nice and easy"
01:48:43;01:48:48;"It'll be just like starting over"
01:48:49;01:48:52;"Have you seen 20th Century Women?"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"Oh yeah"
01:48:54;01:48:55;"Great movie"
01:48:56;01:48:57;"Beautiful movie"
01:48:57;01:48:58;"I thought I told you and Dave"
01:48:58;01:48:59;"You guys gotta see it"
01:48:59;01:49:00;"I looked so early screening of it"
01:49:00;01:49:01;"And I was like"
01:49:01;01:49:02;"Oh okay"
01:49:02;01:49:03;"It's a 1979 Santa Barbara"
01:49:03;01:49:04;"You gotta see it"
01:49:04;01:49:05;"Yeah"
01:49:05;01:49:06;"Because you got a family from Santa Barbara"
01:49:06;01:49:07;"It's incredible"
01:49:07;01:49:08;"Well there's a great Jimmy Carter scene in that"
01:49:08;01:49:09;"Oh yeah"
01:49:09;01:49:10;"The crisis of confidence speech"
01:49:10;01:49:11;"Right"
01:49:11;01:49:14;"But I mean yeah"
01:49:14;01:49:15;"That movie"
01:49:15;01:49:16;"That's centered around that character"
01:49:16;01:49:17;"Right"
01:49:17;01:49:18;"The Billy Crudup"
01:49:18;01:49:19;"That you were describing"
01:49:19;01:49:20;"Sort of a progressive"
01:49:20;01:49:21;"Who's like"
01:49:21;01:49:22;"The Billy Crudup character"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"Yeah people of all these different ages"
01:49:24;01:49:25;"Trying to like figure out what's going on"
01:49:25;01:49:26;"Yeah I love that"
01:49:26;01:49:29;"The simultaneous woman who grew up in the Great Depression"
01:49:29;01:49:31;"Aging hippie"
01:49:31;01:49:33;"Young punks"
01:49:33;01:49:35;"Yeah"
01:49:35;01:49:36;"But"
01:49:36;01:49:37;"Oh man"
01:49:37;01:49:38;"You know what"
01:49:38;01:49:39;"It's like"
01:49:39;01:49:40;"That is so crazy"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"The genre just murdered by"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"Just like some nut"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"What's really sad is that"
01:49:46;01:49:47;"It's that's so brutal"
01:49:47;01:49:49;"That his final like big single"
01:49:49;01:49:50;"Is literally"
01:49:50;01:49:53;"It's been too long since we took the time"
01:49:53;01:49:54;"No one's to blame"
01:49:54;01:49:56;"I know time flies so quickly"
01:49:56;01:49:57;"Oh so quickly"
01:49:57;01:49:58;"So basically it's like"
01:49:58;01:49:59;"Hey look"
01:49:59;01:50:00;"It's neither one of our faults"
01:50:00;01:50:02;"But we've been living our lives"
01:50:02;01:50:04;"We haven't stopped to smell the roses"
01:50:04;01:50:06;"And appreciate each other"
01:50:06;01:50:07;"But when I see you darling"
01:50:07;01:50:09;"It's like we both are falling in love again"
01:50:09;01:50:12;"It'll be just like starting over"
01:50:12;01:50:14;"That's life man"
01:50:14;01:50:15;"When you finally pause"
01:50:15;01:50:16;"To be like you know what"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"I've been like worrying about the wrong things"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"I want to appreciate life"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"That's like the message of the song"
01:50:22;01:50:24;"It's like take a moment to appreciate the people you love"
01:50:24;01:50:25;"Yep"
01:50:25;01:50:26;"That's crazy"
01:50:26;01:50:27;"That was his last single"
01:50:27;01:50:28;"And then he dies"
01:50:28;01:50:29;"Murdered"
01:50:29;01:50:32;"Also weird parallel with the Bruce Springsteen"
01:50:32;01:50:35;"Hungry Heart with the sort of throwback"
01:50:35;01:50:36;"It's funny you say that"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"Because as Colin pointed out on this piece of paper"
01:50:38;01:50:40;"On the day of his murder"
01:50:40;01:50:41;"In December 8, 1980"
01:50:41;01:50:43;"I guess John Lennon did an interview"
01:50:43;01:50:44;"And he said"
01:50:44;01:50:46;"Hungry Heart was a great record"
01:50:46;01:50:47;"And compared it to his song"
01:50:47;01:50:49;"Just like Starting Over"
01:50:49;01:50:50;"Whoa"
01:50:50;01:50:52;"Imagine that you're Bruce"
01:50:52;01:50:53;"And you're like"
01:50:53;01:50:54;"Whoa"
01:50:54;01:50:57;"The dude from the Beatles shouted out my single"
01:50:57;01:50:58;"And then got mur-"
01:50:58;01:50:59;"Oh God"
01:50:59;01:51:01;"Violence man"
01:51:01;01:51:04;"People treating each other with disrespect, hatred"
01:51:04;01:51:05;"It's awful"
01:51:05;01:51:07;"But that must have been a crazy time"
01:51:07;01:51:08;"Those few months"
01:51:08;01:51:09;"That must have been"
01:51:09;01:51:11;"But we got our own crazy time to worry about"
01:51:11;01:51:12;"So let's go back to the future"
01:51:12;01:51:14;"I mean the present"
01:51:14;01:51:18;"The number one song on iTunes"
01:51:18;01:51:21;"During our inauguration"
01:51:21;01:51:24;"Of a president who's gonna roll back a lot of"
01:51:24;01:51:26;"Things that we need to protect ourselves"
01:51:26;01:51:27;"And the people we care about"
01:51:27;01:51:29;"The number one song this week"
01:51:29;01:51:31;"Epitomizing"
01:51:31;01:51:33;"Trump becoming president"
01:51:33;01:51:35;"Is the new Ed Sheeran"
01:51:35;01:51:36;"Shape of You"
01:51:38;01:51:39;"Have you heard this yet Jake?"
01:51:39;01:51:41;"Finger on the pulse"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"No I haven't heard this"
01:51:43;01:51:44;"People are saying this is him"
01:51:44;01:51:45;"You know, dipping his toes a little bit"
01:51:45;01:51:47;"Into the tropical house movement"
01:51:47;01:51:50;"The best place to find the lovers of the bar is where I go"
01:51:50;01:51:53;"Me and my friends at the table doing shots"
01:51:53;01:51:55;"Drinking fast and then we talk slow"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"Come over and start a-"
01:51:57;01:51:58;"I feel like Chainsmokers are kinda trying to do"
01:51:58;01:52:00;"Like an Ed Sheeran thing actually"
01:52:00;01:52:02;"He's kinda like the main like storyteller"
01:52:02;01:52:03;"Pop songwriter right now"
01:52:03;01:52:04;"Is he?"
01:52:04;01:52:05;"Yeah"
01:52:05;01:52:06;"I don't even know who Ed Sheeran is"
01:52:06;01:52:08;"I mean I've heard the name"
01:52:08;01:52:09;"He's British too right?"
01:52:09;01:52:11;"Yeah he's red headed"
01:52:11;01:52:13;"Was he like a talent show winner?"
01:52:13;01:52:15;"I don't think so"
01:52:29;01:52:31;"That's where the drop would normally go"
01:52:43;01:52:45;"Jake is not appreciating that line"
01:52:55;01:52:56;"This is weak"
01:52:56;01:52:57;"Not feeling it?"
01:52:57;01:52:58;"No"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"I like that"
01:53:11;01:53:14;"As President Trump takes office"
01:53:14;01:53:16;"I'm in love with your body"
01:53:16;01:53:18;"Begins to destroy the world and the country"
01:53:18;01:53:20;"Just over and over again"
01:53:20;01:53:22;"This mantra"
01:53:22;01:53:24;"I'm in love with your body"
01:53:26;01:53:28;"I mean what don't you like about it Jake?"
01:53:28;01:53:29;"You can't relate to that"
01:53:29;01:53:31;"You can't relate to just"
01:53:31;01:53:32;"No I can relate to it"
01:53:32;01:53:35;"Love, you know just drunk on lust"
01:53:35;01:53:37;"You met somebody new"
01:53:37;01:53:38;"Yeah"
01:53:38;01:53:40;"And you're just still discovering new things about them"
01:53:40;01:53:41;"And you just"
01:53:41;01:53:42;"I mean that's real"
01:53:42;01:53:44;"That's human sexuality"
01:53:44;01:53:45;"No doubt"
01:53:45;01:53:46;"You're thinking over and over again"
01:53:46;01:53:47;"I'm in love with your body"
01:53:47;01:53:49;"No doubt"
01:53:49;01:53:50;"I've heard"
01:53:50;01:53:51;"But what?"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"You gotta bring a new angle to that bro"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"Like you gotta just like"
01:53:55;01:53:57;"You gotta really impress me"
01:53:57;01:53:59;"If that's what you're coming with"
01:53:59;01:54:01;"Well it's an understated song"
01:54:01;01:54:02;"Okay"
01:54:02;01:54:03;"I mean is that the right subject matter"
01:54:03;01:54:05;"To be understated with?"
01:54:05;01:54:06;"It's slinky and sexy"
01:54:06;01:54:07;"I think"
01:54:07;01:54:09;"Oh is that what it is?"
01:54:21;01:54:22;"There's no hook"
01:54:22;01:54:23;"There's no like"
01:54:23;01:54:24;"What are you talking about?"
01:54:24;01:54:25;"I'm in love with your body"
01:54:25;01:54:26;"I'm in love with the shape of you"
01:54:26;01:54:27;"Come on be my baby"
01:54:27;01:54:28;"Come on"
01:54:28;01:54:29;"Come on be my baby"
01:54:29;01:54:30;"Come on"
01:54:30;01:54:31;"Come on be my baby"
01:54:31;01:54:32;"Come on"
01:54:32;01:54:33;"Come on be my baby"
01:54:33;01:54:34;"Come on"
01:54:34;01:54:35;"Come on be my baby"
01:54:35;01:54:36;"Come on"
01:54:36;01:54:37;"Come on be my baby"
01:54:37;01:54:38;"Come on"
01:54:38;01:54:39;"Come on be my baby"
01:54:39;01:54:40;"Come on"
01:54:40;01:54:41;"Come on be my baby"
01:54:41;01:54:42;"Come on"
01:54:42;01:54:43;"Come on be my baby"
01:54:43;01:54:44;"Come on"
01:54:44;01:54:45;"Come on be my baby"
01:54:45;01:54:46;"Come on"
01:54:46;01:54:49;"I'm in love with the shape of you"
01:54:49;01:54:52;"We push and pull like a magnet do"
01:54:52;01:54:55;"Although my heart is falling too"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"I'm in love with the strip club"
01:54:57;01:55:00;"Last night you were in my room"
01:55:00;01:55:02;"Now my bedsheets smell like you"
01:55:02;01:55:03;"Bedsheets?"
01:55:03;01:55:05;"Yeah so what's your problem with that line man?"
01:55:05;01:55:07;"You made a face both times"
01:55:07;01:55:10;"Ed sang ""My bedsheets smell like you"""
01:55:10;01:55:12;"Like what's your freaking problem dude?"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"Why don't you like that?"
01:55:14;01:55:16;"I don't know man"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"[Laughter]"
01:55:18;01:55:22;"The term bedsheets is just like so clinical"
01:55:22;01:55:23;"Yeah I guess it's like"
01:55:23;01:55:24;"Bedsheets?"
01:55:24;01:55:25;"You probably needed"
01:55:25;01:55:26;"Yeah"
01:55:26;01:55:27;"Well okay"
01:55:27;01:55:28;"Would you change the bedsheets?"
01:55:28;01:55:32;"As a professional songwriter I can imagine that"
01:55:32;01:55:33;"Ed probably"
01:55:33;01:55:34;"Is he bringing in a hospital?"
01:55:34;01:55:36;"Ed probably felt like he needed two syllables there"
01:55:36;01:55:37;"Right"
01:55:37;01:55:39;"So he couldn't just say sheets"
01:55:39;01:55:40;"And now my sheets"
01:55:40;01:55:42;"And now my sheets"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"And now my my my sheets"
01:55:44;01:55:46;"And my my my sheets smell like you"
01:55:46;01:55:47;"Bedsheets"
01:55:47;01:55:48;"Maybe in England they say"
01:55:48;01:55:50;"That rolls off the tongue"
01:55:50;01:55:52;"Maybe in England they say bedsheets more"
01:55:52;01:55:55;"God these bedsheets are filthy"
01:55:55;01:55:59;"Just imagine like after a passionate night with a lover"
01:55:59;01:56:02;"And you text them the next morning and be like"
01:56:02;01:56:06;"Babe I've been thinking about you all morning"
01:56:06;01:56:09;"My bedsheets smell like you"
01:56:09;01:56:10;"But maybe it's a cultural thing"
01:56:10;01:56:12;"Maybe in England they say bedsheets"
01:56:12;01:56:13;"I bet they do"
01:56:13;01:56:14;"Maybe"
01:56:14;01:56:15;"I don't know"
01:56:15;01:56:17;"I don't have charitable interpretations"
01:56:17;01:56:20;"Oh man I got this dog suitor coming over"
01:56:20;01:56:24;"They're gonna stay at my place and watch after the dog"
01:56:24;01:56:27;"I gotta change the bedsheets"
01:56:30;01:56:31;"Yeah we don't say"
01:56:31;01:56:33;"You say sheets in America"
01:56:33;01:56:35;"Bedsheets smell like you"
01:56:35;01:56:36;"Also smell"
01:56:36;01:56:39;"I just like"
01:56:39;01:56:41;"I just hate all those words"
01:56:41;01:56:43;"Nurse Anderson"
01:56:43;01:56:47;"Did you change Mrs. Napolitano's bedsheets today?"
01:56:47;01:56:51;"Well Mrs. Napolitano said you did not change the bedsheets today"
01:56:51;01:56:55;"Yeah it sounds institutional"
01:56:55;01:56:57;"Bedsheets"
01:56:57;01:56:59;"Cultural differences"
01:56:59;01:57:00;"Fascinating"
01:57:00;01:57:01;"Well anyway"
01:57:01;01:57:03;"Who can blame Ed Sheeran in times like these"
01:57:03;01:57:07;"For wanting to retreat into a world of sexuality"
01:57:07;01:57:09;"It's very tempting"
01:57:09;01:57:10;"If you look at what's happening"
01:57:10;01:57:12;"Escapist hedonism"
01:57:12;01:57:14;"Who wouldn't want to just stay"
01:57:14;01:57:18;"Wrapped in bedsheets with their lover"
01:57:18;01:57:21;"Well let's wrap it up"
01:57:21;01:57:23;"That was a great top five"
01:57:23;01:57:26;"Rest in peace John Lennon"
01:57:26;01:57:29;"We spent a pleasant couple hours"
01:57:29;01:57:32;"I wouldn't say avoiding the topics of the day"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"But just talking about kind of tangential things"
01:57:34;01:57:35;"Sure"
01:57:35;01:57:38;"We gotta still keep learning about how America works"
01:57:38;01:57:40;"How big corporations work"
01:57:40;01:57:41;"How pop music works"
01:57:41;01:57:43;"How films work"
01:57:43;01:57:45;"How TV show theme songs work"
01:57:45;01:57:47;"We can't give up on this stuff"
01:57:47;01:57:48;"I'm not worried about it"
01:57:48;01:57:49;"What?"
01:57:49;01:57:50;"Us giving up on it"
01:57:50;01:57:51;"We won't give up"
01:57:51;01:57:55;"That was our first episode of the Trump era"
01:57:55;01:57:58;"I hope that everybody enjoyed these two hours"
01:57:58;01:57:59;"It's Sunday"
01:57:59;01:58:02;"This is a day you can take a couple hours to chill"
01:58:02;01:58:04;"Spend time talking with your friends"
01:58:04;01:58:07;"Researching corporate food history"
01:58:07;01:58:10;"Anyway we'll be back in a couple weeks"
01:58:10;01:58:12;"I'm sure we'll have plenty to talk about"
01:58:12;01:58:15;"Thank you so much to our guest Bart Elmore"
01:58:15;01:58:16;"Over there at Ohio State University"
01:58:16;01:58:18;"Check out his book Citizen Coke"

01:58:30;01:58:32;"Ray Kroc, Grinding It Out"
01:58:32;01:58:34;"Highly recommend it"
01:58:34;01:58:36;"Especially if you're trying to build a business"

01:58:47;01:58:49;"Mercy"
01:58:49;01:58:51;"And maybe I seem a bit confused"
01:58:51;01:58:52;"Yeah maybe"
01:58:52;01:58:54;"But I got your pegs"
01:58:54;01:58:56;"Ha ha ha ha"
01:58:56;01:58:57;"But I don't know what to do"
01:58:57;01:59:02;"With those tossed salads and scrambled eggs"
01:59:02;01:59:05;"They're calling again"
01:59:05;01:59:08;"Scrambled eggs all over my face"
