00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis back again."
00:02;00:06;"We've got a crazy, mega-loaded episode."
00:06;00:09;"We're talking Ariana Grande and Starbucks,"
00:09;00:11;"Bebe Rexha and Lays."
00:11;00:14;"We're talking about the return of the Jonas Brothers."
00:14;00:17;"Here's a very special foodie edition of"
00:17;00:21;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:21;00:23;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beats."
00:23;00:25;"One."
00:29;00:31;"They passed me by"
00:31;00:34;"All of those great romances"
00:34;00:38;"They were after, wobbly"
00:38;00:41;"All my rightful chances"
00:41;00:44;"But picture clear"
00:44;00:49;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:49;00:52;"And so I dealt to the floor"
00:52;00:55;"When the bus had to go"
00:56;01:00;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:00;01:03;"One of us is crying"
01:03;01:06;"One of us is lying"
01:06;01:10;"Leave the lonely man"
01:10;01:12;"Time Crisis back again."
01:12;01:14;"Jake and I are sitting here."
01:14;01:17;"We're sipping on the new Ariana Grande drink from Starbucks."
01:17;01:18;"Rough."
01:18;01:21;"I mean, I don't know if it's just because I sometimes see it,"
01:21;01:24;"but it does feel like just generally the news"
01:24;01:26;"has gotten way more TC."
01:26;01:27;"You know what I mean?"
01:27;01:29;"I just think the frequency of us getting sent articles"
01:29;01:32;"where people are just like, ""This is peak time crisis,"""
01:32;01:33;"has skyrocketed."
01:33;01:34;"I agree."
01:34;01:35;"I mean, we're going to talk about all sorts of stuff,"
01:35;01:37;"but I mean, this week alone,"
01:37;01:41;"we got Bebe Rexha doing some weird campaign for Lays."
01:41;01:44;"We don't even want to get into that, but Ariana Grande,"
01:44;01:47;"she's a Starbucks celebrity ambassador now,"
01:47;01:49;"which I don't think used to be a thing."
01:49;01:51;"And it's called a Cloud Macchiato."
01:51;01:53;"Cloud?"
01:53;01:54;"I used to be the macchiato guy."
01:54;01:56;"That was the working title of Father of the Broad,"
01:56;01:57;"was Mitsubishi Macchiato."
01:57;01:58;"That's a good title."
01:58;02:01;"I do want to call an album eventually Mitsubishi Macchiato,"
02:01;02:04;"so maybe I got to start reaching out to Starbucks and Mitsubishi."
02:04;02:07;"What does the Mitsubishi tie in with it?"
02:07;02:08;"Well, I don't want to get--"
02:08;02:09;"What does that mean? Okay, I don't know."
02:09;02:10;"I don't want to get into that yet"
02:10;02:12;"because that album might not come out for years."
02:12;02:13;"But I mean, on first sip--"
02:13;02:15;"It's gross."
02:15;02:17;"I wasn't going to say gross, but--"
02:17;02:18;"Well, it's just pure sugar."
02:18;02:21;"Well, yeah, because, you know, maybe when I was like 14,"
02:21;02:24;"I might get a beverage like this, but, you know,"
02:24;02:26;"I'm a serious coffee drinker."
02:26;02:27;"Grown man."
02:27;02:28;"I'm a grown man."
02:28;02:29;"I drink my coffee black,"
02:29;02:32;"and it's not because I don't think it tastes slightly better"
02:32;02:34;"sometimes as a latte,"
02:34;02:37;"but also because in the morning my stomach can't handle milk."
02:37;02:40;"But anyway, this is a very, very sweet drink."
02:40;02:41;"I think I have a headache now."
02:41;02:42;"I just sipped it."
02:42;02:43;"From one sip?"
02:43;02:44;"Like three sips."
02:44;02:45;"I'm putting it away."
02:45;02:46;"It's the Cloud Macchiato."
02:46;02:47;"I guess Ariane is really into clouds."
02:47;02:48;"That's cool."
02:48;02:49;"I'm not mad at her."
02:49;02:50;"I'm thinking, like, the cloud."
02:50;02:51;"Oh, really?"
02:51;02:52;"Yeah."
02:52;02:55;"Maybe her point is like, ""Hey, guys, I'm Ariane Grande."
02:55;02:56;"""I'm a major pop star."
02:56;02:59;"""Just like my music and all corporate culture is inescapable"
02:59;03:03;"""because of our crazy networked digital world,"
03:03;03:05;"""I wanted to make a drink that symbolized that,"
03:05;03:08;"""the inescapability of popular things"
03:08;03:11;"""by bringing my celebrity to your coffee."
03:11;03:14;"""I named it the Cloud after the conceptual framework"
03:14;03:15;"""of fully integrated--"
03:15;03:16;"Data storage."
03:16;03:18;"Data-storaged world."""
03:18;03:21;"# Breakfast at Tiffany's in bottles of bubbles"
03:21;03:25;"# Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble"
03:25;03:28;"# Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines"
03:28;03:32;"# Buy myself all of my favorite things"
03:32;03:35;"# Been through some bad, I should be a savage"
03:35;03:39;"# Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage"
03:39;03:42;"# Rather be tied up with calls and not strings"
03:42;03:45;"# Buy my own checks like I might want to sing #"
03:45;03:48;"The drink comes in caramel or cinnamon flavor,"
03:48;03:51;"features espresso, whipped cold foam, and caramel drizzle."
03:51;03:52;"I mean-- Oh, drizzle."
03:52;03:54;"I don't know, maybe the very-- Yeah, drizzle."
03:54;03:56;"That's gross."
03:56;03:58;"Caramel drizzle."
03:58;03:59;"Ugh!"
03:59;04:01;"It's so sweet. It's just like--"
04:01;04:03;"It says on the side of the cup-- It says all high-end."
04:03;04:06;"It says Ger-ist-car-clud-mac."
04:06;04:09;"I mean, it's also possible that not everybody at Starbucks"
04:09;04:11;"might exactly know how to nail a Cloud Macchiato."
04:11;04:14;"Right, they didn't do the company-wide training."
04:14;04:16;"So you can get this iced or hot?"
04:16;04:19;"I mean, all this is is just, like, an iced coffee"
04:19;04:23;"with a ton of, like, 8 pumps of corn syrup in it."
04:23;04:26;"I fail to see how this is any different than, like,"
04:26;04:29;"the frap machine that used to come in the glass bottle"
04:29;04:30;"you get at the gas station."
04:30;04:33;"Well, it's just, like, 10% more sugar than that."
04:33;04:35;"It's like half coffee, half foam."
04:35;04:38;"So they're actually, like, making a killing on this."
04:38;04:40;"They're charging a premium for the brand,"
04:40;04:43;"but it's only half the coffee. Genius, right?"
04:43;04:45;"All right, and Starbucks reached out."
04:45;04:47;"They're gonna help you get some press for the tour"
04:47;04:49;"and give you a big fat check."
04:49;04:52;"They want to make sure that it's a catchy name for the drink,"
04:52;04:56;"and they want to figure out a way that it can have 50% less coffee"
04:56;04:57;"to cut costs."
04:57;04:59;"All right, I just got down to thinking,"
04:59;05:00;"""Okay, what do I like?"""
05:00;05:03;"So half of it's coffee at the bottom."
05:03;05:05;"I got it. It's 50% foam."
05:05;05:07;"Oh, wait, we were just drinking the caramel one?"
05:07;05:09;"All right, I'm gonna try the cinnamon one now."
05:09;05:11;"Kind of like a horchata flavor."
05:11;05:14;"Ooh, I'm gonna be lit on this for about 20 minutes."
05:14;05:16;"It's hard to stop drinking, though."
05:16;05:18;"Yeah, the cinnamon one's a little better, but it's also--"
05:18;05:20;"Yeah, I gotta move these."
05:20;05:22;"I know, we gotta get them out of our arms range."
05:22;05:24;"Because especially today, today's a real foodie show."
05:24;05:27;"Not only did we just kick things off with a cloud macchiato,"
05:27;05:30;"we also finally have some Sour Patch Kids cereal."
05:30;05:32;"What's the backstory on this?"
05:32;05:35;"I saw this today when I came in, and I was confused."
05:35;05:37;"I feel like we got a lot of tweets and messages"
05:37;05:39;"when they first announced they were gonna make"
05:39;05:40;"Sour Patch Kids cereal."
05:40;05:43;"So, Jake, you may not remember, but before it was a cereal,"
05:43;05:45;"Sour Patch Kids was primarily known as a candy."
05:45;05:47;"You might get it at the corner store."
05:47;05:48;"Sure."
05:48;05:50;"So then they teamed up with Post to make a cereal,"
05:50;05:52;"and at first everybody's like, ""That's crazy,"
05:52;05:54;"because Sour Patch Kids are sour."
05:54;05:56;"First they're sour, then they're sweet."""
05:56;06:00;"So the idea of a sour cereal, people already were just, like, hating."
06:00;06:02;"And it was hard to actually track down a box at first."
06:02;06:04;"I think they did kind of a slow rollout,"
06:04;06:07;"but we finally got some, and we figured we'd try that."
06:07;06:09;"I think we gotta wait a minute between the cloud macchiato."
06:09;06:10;"I know, dude. I'm kind of like--"
06:10;06:13;"I think if we did straight cloud macchiatos into Sour Patch Kids cereal,"
06:13;06:16;"we would just have to kind of, like, just throw on, like, some Pink Floyd"
06:16;06:18;"and be like, you know, that's the rest of the show."
06:18;06:20;"We're dosing, dude. Yeah."

08:22;08:23;"It's insane."
08:23;08:26;"I guess some people are used to it, but sugar is like the silent killer."
08:26;08:27;"It really is, man."
08:27;08:28;"It's brutal when--"
08:28;08:29;"Sugar is no joke."
08:29;08:33;"Even sometimes you think you're eating healthy, and then you kind of look back, and you're like,"
08:33;08:38;"""Well, between that fruit smoothie and that,"" you're taking in way more--"
08:38;08:41;"Just because you don't house a Butterfinger for breakfast"
08:41;08:44;"doesn't mean you're not taking down horrific amounts of sugar."
08:44;08:49;"I had a banana and peanut butter this morning, kind of a mid-morning snack because I was up early."
08:49;08:50;"On a piece of bread?"
08:50;08:56;"No, I just sliced a banana and took a spoonful of peanut butter out of a jar."
08:56;08:57;"On each individual--"
08:57;09:01;"Yeah, I just put the big dab of peanut butter on the plate, cut the peanut butter,"
09:01;09:06;"and then with the knife, kind of swiped a little bit of peanut butter on each little chunk of banana."
09:06;09:10;"But I was looking at the peanut butter, second ingredient, cane sugar."
09:10;09:11;"Oh, man."
09:11;09:15;"It's like ground peanuts, sugar, and palm oil."
09:15;09:19;"Yeah, man. Sugar is really not good for you."
09:19;09:21;"[explosion]"
09:21;09:24;"How many grams of sugar in a cloud macchiato?"
09:24;09:27;"Good Housekeeping had an article, ""Is the new cloud macchiato healthy?"""
09:27;09:29;"Oh, my God."
09:29;09:32;"Okay, so apparently there's egg whites in the cloud macchiato."
09:32;09:33;"Gross."
09:33;09:38;"Really nothing except black coffee is going to be ""healthy."""
09:38;09:41;"So the caramel cloud macchiato is 39 grams of sugar."
09:41;09:44;"How many grams, or is the recommended daily allowance?"
09:44;09:45;"That's a great question."
09:45;09:50;"The maximum amount of added sugars you should eat in a day are 37 grams."
09:50;09:51;"Booyah."
09:51;09:56;"So if you drink a whole Ariana Grande, you're already over your limit."
09:56;10:02;"Maybe she was like, ""All right, guys, I want my drink to be close to the daily recommended intake of sugar."""
10:02;10:05;"But she should be clear with the fans, this is your treat for the day."
10:05;10:06;"Yeah."
10:06;10:07;"That's it."
10:07;10:09;"Oh, and women, 25 grams a day."
10:09;10:11;"Men, 37 grams."
10:11;10:12;"Wait."
10:12;10:16;"Do men, like, burn calories faster because they have more muscle or, like--"
10:16;10:17;"Really?"
10:17;10:18;"They have different metabolisms."
10:18;10:21;"I think that's, like, kind of a thing, right?"
10:21;10:24;"Men have a higher caloric intake or whatever."
10:24;10:26;"I don't know what I'm talking about."
10:26;10:27;"I mean, it's all--"
10:27;10:28;"Man."
10:28;10:29;"It's all guesswork."
10:29;10:31;"Food and calories and stuff."
10:31;10:36;"Now, fellas, you're listening to a very men's health episode of Time Crisis."
10:36;10:41;"Imagine if Ariana Grande came out and said, ""Hey, I'm so excited to announce to everybody that I've got this new cloud macchiato."
10:41;10:45;"It's 39 grams of sugar, so ladies, keep away."
10:45;10:47;"This one's for the fellas."""
10:47;10:48;"What are her fans called?"
10:48;10:49;"Ariana-nators?"
10:49;10:50;"What?"
10:50;10:51;"Ariana Ralph-nators."
10:51;10:53;"That rolls off the tongue."
10:53;10:54;"Ariana-nators."
10:54;10:57;"Did you ever get to the bottom of the Vampire Weekend fan base?"
10:57;10:58;"No."
10:58;10:59;"I mean, we've gotten some emails."
10:59;11:00;"Weekenders?"
11:00;11:02;"I still like the dude from Mexico who said we should be bochos."
11:02;11:03;"Right."
11:03;11:04;"And I feel like--"
11:04;11:05;"That's pretty good."
11:05;11:07;"--people often throw out Weekenders, which I'm not mad at."
11:07;11:08;"Vampies?"
11:08;11:09;"Maybe."
11:09;11:10;"Maybe--"
11:10;11:11;"Vampires."
11:11;11:12;"Maybe."
11:12;11:17;"If someone as popular and beloved as Ariana Grande's fans can be called Ariana-nators."
11:17;11:18;"That's terrible."
11:18;11:22;"Hey, I've got a very special announcement for male Ariana-nators only."
11:22;11:24;"I've got a new drink at Starbucks."
11:24;11:25;"Limited time only."
11:25;11:27;"For limited time only."
11:27;11:32;"I specially crafted this with the daily intake of sugar for the average American male in mind."
11:32;11:34;"Way too much sugar for the women."
11:34;11:38;"And, fellas, if you do drink an entire one, that's it for the day."
11:38;11:39;"Okay."
11:39;11:43;"No apples, no bananas, no peanut butter, no dessert."
11:43;11:51;"Just like Ariana Grande decides in 2019 to make a super-gendered coffee press campaign."
11:51;11:55;"Now, I'm sure a lot of women are asking, ""Well, how can I participate in this?"""
11:55;11:58;"Well, you can help the men keep track of their sugar."
11:58;12:02;"Now, obviously, your body is not equipped to handle this much sugar."
12:02;12:07;"But it can be kind of fun for you to maybe team up with a man and keep an eye on him,"
12:07;12:09;"making sure that he doesn't have a banana later in the day."
12:09;12:10;"Open a spreadsheet."
12:10;12:11;"Yeah."
12:11;12:14;"Kind of like being the manager for the high school baseball team."
12:14;12:16;"You can ride the bus, but you can't play."
12:16;12:17;"I bet they'd go over really well."
12:17;12:24;"Okay, so we were just informed that the Cloud Macchiato dropped when it did because of International Women's Day."
12:24;12:30;"I find it even stranger that Ariana Grande would drop a men's macchiato on International Women's Day."
12:30;12:31;"That's messed up."
12:31;12:32;"Where's the outrage?"
12:32;12:35;"I love Ariana Grande, but I've got to say there's some hypocrisy here."
12:35;12:36;"Why does she get a pass?"
12:36;12:42;"Clearly, almost to the gram, this drink was crafted with a men's sugar intake in mind."
12:42;12:47;"Or maybe because the drink is so clearly unhealthy, it's a way on International Women's Day to punish men."
12:47;12:50;"Can you only get it in the Grande size?"
12:50;12:51;"That's a great question."
12:51;12:53;"Could you get the Ariana Grande venti?"
12:53;12:57;"I also specify the ounceage if I go to a Starbucks."
12:57;12:59;"Wait, what do you get at Starbucks?"
12:59;13:01;"Let me get a 16-ounce iced coffee."
13:01;13:03;"I never learned the names."
13:03;13:06;"But is that easier than saying medium or large?"
13:06;13:08;"I like to specify the ounces."
13:08;13:13;"I'm not even sure what, like, is a 16, I guess a 16 is probably a medium."
13:13;13:16;"Because at some coffee shops, it's a large."
13:16;13:20;"But 16 is just such a standard cup size that you feel confident going in there?"
13:20;13:21;"I guess that's my question."
13:21;13:25;"Yeah, 12 ounces is your standard hot cup of coffee."
13:25;13:27;"And then you know when you get an iced coffee, it's a little bit bigger."
13:27;13:30;"I always get a real tall boy at Coffee Bean."
13:30;13:33;"You get like a 20 or 22-ounce iced coffee."
13:33;13:35;"I wonder, I just house those."
13:35;13:36;"I go 16, dude."
13:36;13:39;"These are fairly standard across coffee shops."
13:39;13:42;"Somebody's like, ""Sir, I have a 15 or a 17-ounce."""
13:42;13:44;"That'd be cool."
15:49;15:51;"I don't know if I've said this on Sound Prez before,"
15:51;15:55;"but you know how when Starbucks kind of first went global,"
15:55;15:58;"oh man, we should have had a winter call-in."
15:58;15:59;"Oh, man."
15:59;16:00;"Shout out to Winter."
16:00;16:02;"And I want to get Winter's take on Howard Schultz."
16:02;16:05;"Okay, all right, next episode, let's get Winter."
16:05;16:09;"What if Winter teamed up with one of the biggest Arianators"
16:09;16:14;"to go to every U.S. Starbucks and have a Cloud Macchiato?"
16:14;16:15;"They'd both die."
16:15;16:19;"Yeah, because Winter is really like, he's all about just the black coffee"
16:19;16:21;"because otherwise, yeah, he wouldn't be able to sustain it."
16:21;16:23;"And Winter seems like he's in good shape."
16:23;16:25;"He's pretty health conscious."
16:25;16:28;"Yeah, I mean a guy that's like spending the bulk of his life in a car"
16:28;16:31;"driving to Starbucks is clearly pretty health conscious."
16:31;16:32;"Yeah, we should ask Winter about that next time."
16:32;16:34;"What's his diet like?"
16:34;16:37;"Just like really intense, like lean, like camping food."
16:37;16:39;"I mean, he seemed like he was in great shape."
16:39;16:40;"Yeah."
16:40;16:42;"Winter seems like he's a thoughtful guy, so I would imagine that--"
16:42;16:43;"Oh, for sure."
16:43;16:44;"--if he's spending a lot of time in the car,"
16:44;16:47;"I bet he's making sure he gets some cardio in the morning,"
16:47;16:50;"pulls over to a rest stop, does some jumping jacks, something like that."
16:50;16:51;"Push-ups."
16:51;16:54;"Okay, clearly we got a lot of questions for you, Winter, on the next episode."
16:54;16:56;"Oh, but the thing I was thinking about was Starbucks."
16:56;16:58;"Oh my God, I'm jacked off this."
16:58;17:00;"Cloud Macchiato."
17:00;17:01;"Can't think straight."
17:01;17:03;"Do not recommend the product, folks."
17:03;17:05;"Anything I say on this time crisis doesn't count."
17:05;17:06;"Yeah, this is a weird one."
17:06;17:08;"We are under the influence, man."
17:08;17:09;"We're dosed."
17:10;17:11;"[laughs]"
17:11;17:13;"Dosed by Ariana."
17:13;17:17;"The thing I was going to say is, remember when Starbucks first came out,"
17:17;17:21;"everybody would joke about the fact that the sizes had funny names."
17:21;17:22;"Yeah."
17:22;17:23;"Venti, Grande, whatever."
17:23;17:29;"I even remember when Ariana--early days, that was like a common joke you'd see repeated a lot."
17:29;17:31;"Ariana Grande--well, I think you saw two things."
17:31;17:33;"There were two classic tweets about her."
17:33;17:36;"It was, ""Ariana Grande, that sounds like a font in Microsoft Word."""
17:36;17:37;"That was pretty witty."
17:37;17:40;"And I was like, ""Ariana Grande sounds like something you order at Starbucks."""
17:40;17:41;"Boom."
17:41;17:42;"Yeah, so there was a lot of that."
17:42;17:45;"But when Starbucks first came out, that was the classic joke."
17:45;17:49;"That was like, ""Venti, Grande, hey, I'm just a regular person."
17:49;17:50;"Can I just get a large?"""
17:50;17:55;"And so that was always a joke, right, where people were kind of puncturing the pretension of Starbucks."
17:55;17:56;"Yep."
17:56;17:58;"But then, like, with a lot of things that are rooted in truth,"
17:58;18:02;"eventually the meme of it all actually overtakes reality,"
18:02;18:06;"and it became this thing that people would always go on about, ""Oh, my God, Starbucks and Venti."""
18:06;18:12;"And I'm pretty sure in my lifetime as an adult going to Starbucks for the past 15 years--"
18:12;18:13;"Probably longer."
18:13;18:18;"Well, I'm saying, you know, as an adult, maybe when I was like 12, I would tag along with my mom."
18:18;18:22;"But, you know, as an adult making my own decisions, I go to Starbucks."
18:22;18:26;"I've often said medium or large because I didn't really--I got confused, right?"
18:26;18:28;"I didn't feel comfortable saying it."
18:28;18:30;"And I basically never got pushback."
18:30;18:31;"Yeah, I've never gotten pushback."
18:31;18:32;"I've never gotten pushback."
18:32;18:34;"And I feel like there's this joke that people still make."
18:34;18:38;"They still find this kind of--I don't know why I'm defending--I'm not defending Starbucks."
18:38;18:41;"But, you know, I'm interested in the truth, man."
18:41;18:47;"And I feel like it's 2019, and you still see people making these jokes about, like,"
18:47;18:51;"""So I go into Starbucks to ask for a medium. Don't you mean a grande?"""
18:51;18:52;"I still hear people say this."
18:52;18:54;"This is your Sebastian--"
18:54;18:57;"Yeah, it sounds like something he would say, but, you know, I'm a fan of his comedy."
18:57;18:59;"I don't know if he said this, but I'm not even talking about professional comedians."
18:59;19:04;"I'm just talking about regular people still make this kind of '90s joke about, ""Oh, my God,"""
19:04;19:09;"and then you go to Starbucks and everything's Venti and grande, like whatever happened to small, medium, and large."
19:09;19:13;"I don't go to Starbucks that much, but I've never gone in there and asked for, like, a small or medium"
19:13;19:16;"and gotten serious pushback from the people who work there."
19:16;19:20;"Because, like, obviously the people who work at Starbucks are, by and large, regular people"
19:20;19:22;"who just want a little health insurance."
19:22;19:23;"It's probably part of their training."
19:23;19:29;"They're like, ""Listen, people are going to come in. They're not going to play ball with the Venti, the grande."
19:29;19:30;"Just, you know, roll with it."""
19:30;19:31;"Just roll with it."
19:31;19:35;"If they say something that you think they might be confused, you could say,"
19:35;19:39;"""I see you want the 16-ounce or something, but if somebody says medium, give them a grande."""
19:39;19:43;"They're like, ""Really? Aren't we supposed to, like, fight them and be condescending?"""
19:43;19:45;"They're like, ""No, we don't want to sell as much coffee as possible."""
19:45;19:47;"Grande is a confusing name."
19:47;19:50;"That should be the large because it's, like, grand."
19:50;19:52;"Grande in Spanish is, like, large, I think."
19:52;19:53;"Big?"
19:53;19:54;"Big."
19:54;19:55;"Yeah."
19:55;19:56;"So it's, like, kind of misleading."
19:56;19:59;"But that's also part of a trend that goes far beyond Starbucks."
19:59;20:02;"That also was, like, a big '90s joke how at the movie theater they shifted everything"
20:02;20:04;"where you're like, ""Can I get a small soda?"""
20:04;20:08;"And they'll be like, ""We have medium, large, extra large, and extreme."""
20:08;20:10;"That is the most George Orwell."
20:10;20:11;"Right."
20:11;20:12;"Small doesn't exist."
20:12;20:13;"Nothing is small."
20:13;20:15;"God, that's messed up."
20:15;20:17;"But anyway, my point is--"
20:17;20:21;"and the TC crew can sound off in the comments--"
20:21;20:24;"have you truly, any time recently, gone to a Starbucks"
20:24;20:29;"and not used their preferred nomenclature and gotten serious pushback?"
20:29;20:32;"Because also, the way I think about it is, like, you go to Starbucks,"
20:32;20:35;"in another moment in life you could have been working at Starbucks."
20:35;20:37;"You know, we're all more or less the same people."
20:37;20:40;"Just picture, like, that you worked at Starbucks, Jake."
20:40;20:43;"Whatever you're training, and somebody came and asked you for a medium,"
20:43;20:45;"you'd be like, ""Okay, this one?"""
20:45;20:46;"Yeah."
20:46;20:49;"So you're saying societally we need to get over this joke"
20:49;20:52;"because we're 25 years deep on that joke."
20:52;20:54;"That joke isn't funny anymore."
20:54;20:55;"Starbucks won."
20:56;20:57;"They affected our language."
20:57;20:58;"Talk about Orwell."
20:58;21:01;"Or arguably we the people won."
21:01;21:03;"No, I would argue they won."
21:03;21:06;"It's not like people are now going into 7-Eleven and being like,"
21:06;21:09;"""Hey, you're out of Venti cups for the big gulps."""
21:09;21:11;"We won."
21:11;21:14;"That would be amazing."
21:14;21:15;"Just everybody in America--"
21:15;21:17;"That would be so heavy."
21:17;21:20;"--started just using short, tall, grande, and Venti"
21:20;21:22;"to be, like, the sizes for everything."
21:22;21:23;"Whoa."
21:23;21:25;"It's like the merch guy on tour."
21:25;21:29;"How many days left from the UK tour t-shirt?"
21:29;21:31;"I picked up a great t-shirt this past weekend."
21:31;21:32;"Which one?"
21:32;21:34;"At the Twiddle show."
21:34;21:35;"Oh, yeah, I got the same one."
21:35;21:37;"Oh, man, this is a real--"
21:37;21:40;"Maybe it's a good thing that we're high off our asses on Cloud Macchiatos"
21:40;21:43;"because we got so much material to cover today."
21:43;21:45;"This is going to be a four-hour show because we're just--"
21:45;21:47;"They're just going to end the show, go into the next one,"
21:47;21:50;"we'll just still be in the studio just chatting it up."
21:50;21:53;"They think they're still taping."
21:53;21:56;"Yeah, everybody's gone home for the day."
21:56;21:57;"Lights are out."
22:01;22:04;"[rapping]"
22:23;22:27;"If you don't ask it then I'm at your mans house Nickname Gitmo, cause he ran out"
22:27;22:30;"What trends have you seen, can I ask? Rocking lace fronts but you coming last"
22:30;22:34;"So where they be getting at bag? Saying if 12 closed for the tax?"
22:34;22:38;"Weak ass music got my ear bleeding My stiffers on junk when I'm cheerleading"
22:38;22:42;"Noise in the crib I don't fear demons Claiming they woke but they still dreaming"
22:42;22:46;"Wake em up with a large cup, large cup, large cup"
22:46;22:49;"Give em some of that starbucks, starbucks, starbucks"
22:49;22:53;"When they see me they starstruck, starstruck, starstruck"
22:53;22:57;"Big money calling starbucks, starbucks, starbucks"
22:57;23:03;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beast1"
23:03;23:06;"Oh wait dude we've seen a lot of concerts together"
23:06;23:10;"We saw Bob Seger, and the Silver Bullet Band at the Forum"
23:10;23:12;"And we saw Twiddle at the Troubadour"
23:12;23:14;"Huge week"
23:14;23:16;"Well let's start with Twiddle cause it's a little fresher"
23:16;23:18;"Yep, they rolled out the red carpet"
23:18;23:22;"Shout out to Twiddle, Mahali, also their management"
23:22;23:23;"Shout out to Kevin"
23:23;23:24;"And Ben"
23:24;23:27;"I was nervous I wasn't going to be in town but I was psyched that I was there"
23:27;23:29;"So Twiddle came and played their LA show"
23:29;23:30;"They've been on tour a bunch"
23:30;23:32;"I met up with Jake and uh"
23:32;23:36;"About four-sevenths of Richard Pictures"
23:36;23:38;"Twiddle and their team hooked it up"
23:38;23:39;"Got right in"
23:39;23:41;"Had a drink at the bar at the Troubadour"
23:41;23:43;"They took us to chop it up with Mahali a little bit"
23:43;23:45;"In the front before the show started"
23:45;23:46;"Good to meet him"
23:46;23:47;"Great dude"
23:47;23:51;"And this is the first show of their kind of west coast leg"
23:51;23:52;"So we didn't know what to expect"
23:52;23:56;"We got tipped off a little bit early that Jam Flow Man was going to be in the second set"
23:56;23:57;"Right"
23:57;23:58;"And it kind of started late"
23:58;24:00;"It started at 10.15"
24:00;24:01;"Oh wow"
24:01;24:02;"I didn't realize it was that late"
24:02;24:03;"Yeah, I don't"
24:03;24:04;"Two sets"
24:05;24:07;"Their merch operation was substantial"
24:07;24:08;"Very professional"
24:08;24:11;"Yeah I mean I feel like even Vampire Weekend we've never had that much merch"
24:11;24:13;"We gotta get cracking for this year"
24:13;24:16;"They had multiple hats, multiple shirts"
24:16;24:18;"We both got the twiddle tie-dye"
24:18;24:19;"It was kind of the most fun one"
24:19;24:20;"The other ones were cool too"
24:20;24:22;"But we should talk about the actual show"
24:22;24:23;"So first of all"
24:23;24:25;"The set list was an anagram"
24:25;24:27;"Maybe this is kind of a Jam Band thing"
24:27;24:28;"I think Phish does this"
24:28;24:29;"I'd never quite heard of it"
24:29;24:30;"So basically"
24:30;24:34;"The first letter of every song spelled something out"
24:34;24:36;"So in set one"
24:36;24:38;"They opened with ""Lost in the Cold"""
24:38;24:42;"And then they followed up with the song that we talked about with Mahali before"
24:42;24:43;"""Orlandos"""
24:43;24:46;"Because that's part of the extended Jamflow Man universe"
24:46;24:47;"That song"
24:47;24:48;"So ""Lost in the Cold"""
24:48;24:49;"Then ""Orlandos"""
24:49;24:51;"Then ""Syncopated Healing"""
24:51;24:52;"Sick"
24:52;24:54;"So so far we got L.O.S."
24:54;24:56;"And guess where the show was"
24:56;24:57;"Los Angeles"
24:57;25:00;"So basically"
25:00;25:02;"The entire show spelled out"
25:02;25:04;"Los Angeles Jams"
25:04;25:05;"With the J being"
25:05;25:06;"Jamflow Man"
25:07;25:08;"Deep into the second set"
25:09;25:11;"We had a great vantage point"
25:11;25:13;"People ask me about the show"
25:13;25:16;"Because obviously we're deeply familiar with Jamflow Man"
25:16;25:18;"A few other songs"
25:18;25:21;"But neither of us can claim to be like hardcore Twiddle junkies"
25:21;25:23;"That we know everything"
25:23;25:24;"And they have a lot of material"
25:24;25:25;"And so some people ask me"
25:25;25:26;"Well yeah how was the show"
25:26;25:27;"And I was like honestly"
25:27;25:29;"If there's a band or genre to watch"
25:29;25:31;"When you don't know every song"
25:31;25:33;"It's like a Twiddle Jam type set"
25:33;25:34;"Because"
25:34;25:35;"I just like picturing"
25:35;25:38;"If I only knew three to four songs from somebody else's set"
25:38;25:40;"I'd be like bored out of my mind"
25:40;25:42;"But they keep it fun"
25:42;25:43;"There's jams"
25:43;25:46;"There's a lot of solo moments"
25:46;25:48;"It's like a crazy dubstep breakdown"
25:48;25:49;"Crowd loved it"
25:49;25:51;"Oh and the crowd was amazing"
25:51;25:52;"So we talked a little bit about this"
25:52;25:54;"With the Twiddles management and Mahali too"
25:54;25:56;"LA has always had a reputation"
25:56;25:58;"To be of all the big cities in America"
25:58;26:00;"One of the least jammy"
26:00;26:01;"Jam band hostile"
26:01;26:02;"No country for"
26:02;26:03;"Jam band"
26:03;26:05;"No country for Jamflow Man"
26:05;26:07;"That's the song I'm going to write"
26:07;26:09;"That's the sequel"
26:09;26:11;"So LA's just never been real jam band country"
26:11;26:13;"And I think the reason people point that out"
26:13;26:15;"Is because it just seems surprising"
26:15;26:17;"Because arguably jam bands"
26:17;26:19;"Via the Grateful Dead come from California"
26:19;26:20;"Sure"
26:20;26:21;"San Francisco"
26:21;26:22;"And you know"
26:22;26:23;"You got your NorCal SoCal rivalry"
26:23;26:24;"But still"
26:24;26:26;"Yeah I mean LA is like a chill"
26:26;26:28;"Psychedelic town"
26:28;26:29;"Right"
26:29;26:31;"But it's also corporate"
26:31;26:32;"And uptight"
26:32;26:33;"I don't know I mean it's"
26:33;26:35;"Is it like Hollywood"
26:35;26:36;"Is anti-jam"
26:36;26:37;"Yeah it's weird"
26:37;26:39;"There are a lot of old hippies and stuff in LA"
26:39;26:41;"I mean I guess kind of a lot of the"
26:41;26:43;"Post-dead jam bands were East Coast"
26:43;26:44;"Yeah"
26:44;26:45;"Phish"
26:45;26:46;"Bisco"
26:46;26:48;"Widespread is Southern"
26:48;26:49;"But East Coast Southern"
26:49;26:50;"Yeah"
26:50;26:51;"So maybe just naturally"
26:51;26:53;"When Phish is you know"
26:53;26:55;"Selling 200,000 tickets in Maine or something"
26:55;26:56;"And people like take notice"
26:56;26:57;"And then they come to LA"
26:57;26:59;"And they just can't put up the same numbers"
26:59;27:01;"People are like yeah it's not jam band country"
27:01;27:02;"But you know they probably still did okay"
27:02;27:04;"That's kind of interesting actually"
27:04;27:05;"If you think of the whole West Coast"
27:05;27:06;"Like other"
27:06;27:07;"Well I think"
27:07;27:09;"Prominent jam bands from like Oregon or"
27:09;27:11;"Well cause Oregon is super crunchy"
27:11;27:12;"And jammy"
27:12;27:14;"And they said that they have great shows up there"
27:14;27:15;"So I don't know"
27:15;27:17;"I'm lost"
27:17;27:21;"And I can't seem to find my way home"
27:21;27:23;"I've been burning up inside"
27:23;27:25;"Burning out my mind"
27:25;27:27;"On an endless winding road"
27:27;27:29;"All my burdens keep me hurting"
27:29;27:31;"Ever present, never certain"
27:31;27:34;"All alone make me beating out my soul"
27:34;27:36;"It's hard to see the future"
27:36;27:38;"When the present doesn't suit you"
27:38;27:40;"Everyday feels like a blinding cold"
27:40;27:46;"Blinding cold"
27:46;27:48;"There's a hole in my energy"
27:48;27:50;"It's blurring out my sanity"
27:50;27:52;"A road and a thrill of getting on"
27:52;27:54;"I'm a bit in with society"
27:54;27:56;"It's blinding my integrity"
27:56;27:58;"While undermining my goals"
27:58;28:00;"It's blurring my intensity"
28:00;28:01;"Muting my ability"
28:01;28:03;"To avoid the bumps in the road"
28:03;28:05;"I can't execute the skills I need"
28:05;28:07;"Relax and keep my dreaming free"
28:07;28:09;"While stumbling out in the cold"
28:09;28:14;"Out in the cold"
28:14;28:16;"Cause I've been struggling"
28:16;28:20;"For way way too long"
28:20;28:22;"It ain't time for a change"
28:22;28:25;"I'm ready to move on"
28:25;28:28;"And yes I'm scared"
28:28;28:31;"To right all my wrongs"
28:31;28:33;"But I'll be okay"
28:33;28:37;"I'm stronger than I thought"
28:37;28:39;"They're getting bored with technology"
28:39;28:41;"It's eating up my decency"
28:41;28:43;"So why do I feel so alone?"
28:43;28:45;"I'm disconnected from my family"
28:45;28:47;"My friends don't want to talk to me"
28:47;28:49;"It's getting out of control"
28:49;28:51;"I turned from my destiny"
28:51;28:53;"And filled it with an evil seed"
28:53;28:55;"That's suing me and you take hold"
28:55;28:57;"The truth was right in front of me"
28:57;28:59;"That all along I had the key"
28:59;29:01;"In front of the cold"
29:01;29:06;"In front of the cold"
29:06;29:08;"Cause I've been struggling"
29:08;29:11;"For way way too long"
29:11;29:14;"It ain't time for a change"
29:14;29:17;"I'm ready to move on"
29:17;29:19;"And yes I'm scared"
29:19;29:23;"To right all my wrongs"
29:23;29:25;"But I'll be okay"
29:25;29:28;"I'm stronger than I thought"
29:28;29:30;"And I'm not gonna waste"
29:30;29:34;"One minute of this life"
29:34;29:36;"I got a second chance"
29:36;29:39;"To do what is right"
29:39;29:42;"I'm gonna dance in the rain"
29:42;29:45;"And lay out in the sunshine"
29:45;29:47;"Take all my pain"
29:47;29:51;"And turn it into moonlight"
29:51;29:53;"I'm lost"
29:53;29:56;"And I can't seem to find my way home"
29:57;29:59;"I've been burning up time"
29:59;30:01;"And burning out my mind"
30:01;30:03;"On an endless winding road"
30:03;30:05;"All my burdens keep me hurting"
30:05;30:07;"Ever present, ever certain"
30:07;30:09;"All alone they keep eating up my soul"
30:09;30:11;"It's hard to see the future"
30:11;30:13;"When the present doesn't suit you"
30:13;30:15;"Every day feels like a blinding cold"
30:15;30:20;"Blinding cold"
30:20;30:22;"Cause I've been struggling"
30:22;30:26;"For way way too long"
30:26;30:28;"And it's time for a change"
30:28;30:31;"I'm ready to move on"
30:31;30:33;"And yes I'm scared"
30:33;30:37;"To right all my wrongs"
30:37;30:39;"But I'll be okay"
30:39;30:42;"I'm stronger than I thought"
30:42;30:45;"And I'm not gonna waste"
30:45;30:48;"One minute of this life"
30:48;30:50;"I got a second chance"
30:50;30:53;"To do what is right"
30:53;30:56;"I'm gonna dance in the rain"
30:56;30:59;"And lay out in the sunshine"
30:59;31:01;"Take all my pain"
31:01;31:05;"And turn it into moonlight"
31:05;31:07;"Take all my pain"
31:07;31:10;"And melt it with the sunshine"
31:10;31:12;"Take all my pain"
31:12;31:16;"And turn it into white light"
31:16;31:18;"Take all my pain"
31:18;31:23;"And give myself a good light"
31:23;31:25;"I wonder if it's a Hollywood thing"
31:25;31:27;"You know you always see these weird quotes"
31:27;31:29;"from like kinda Hollywood moguls"
31:29;31:31;"where they're kinda say stuff like"
31:31;31:33;"I feel like Netflix, something, maybe somebody"
31:33;31:35;"made a comment like ""What are the challenges"
31:35;31:37;"you're gonna face?"" and maybe one of the executives"
31:37;31:39;"there said something like ""Listen,"
31:39;31:42;"our competitors are not HBO and Showtime"
31:42;31:44;"or Hulu, our competitor is Fortnite."""
31:44;31:46;"Right? I saw this quote somewhere."
31:46;31:49;"So because a place like Netflix is just so huge"
31:49;31:51;"and just taking over,"
31:51;31:53;"they're not looking at other content creators,"
31:53;31:56;"other people who have streaming TV, movie platforms."
31:56;31:59;"They're saying ""What we're doing is fighting for eyeballs."""
31:59;32:01;"We're so much bigger than just like"
32:01;32:03;"""Oh, who has the best shows?"""
32:03;32:05;"We're literally fighting for the time"
32:05;32:07;"that somebody could spend watching stranger things"
32:07;32:09;"versus playing something."
32:09;32:11;"And I honestly think there could be a connection"
32:11;32:12;"with the Jam Band thing."
32:12;32:13;"If you're a Hollywood mogul,"
32:13;32:15;"you know you're running Disney,"
32:15;32:18;"Warner Brothers, Sony Pictures Classic,"
32:18;32:20;"these guys have this bird's eye view of the industry."
32:20;32:22;"So they're not worried about"
32:22;32:24;"winning an Oscar this year,"
32:24;32:26;"you know, how are we gonna do at the box office?"
32:26;32:28;"They're like ""We need to keep the eyes and ears"
32:28;32:31;"of America on our Hollywood products."
32:31;32:33;"And if you wanna go see Ariana Grande do a show"
32:33;32:35;"for 90 minutes, that's fine."
32:35;32:36;"She's part of our world."
32:36;32:38;"We can incorporate her into the Hollywood world."""
32:38;32:39;"And then you say ""Well, okay,"
32:39;32:42;"but what if I told you that there's a form of music"
32:42;32:44;"that encourages people to check out"
32:44;32:45;"for hours at a time,"
32:45;32:46;"and even during the day,"
32:46;32:48;"listen back to the show you just saw?"""
32:48;32:49;"Well, hold on."
32:49;32:50;"You know what?"
32:50;32:52;"You told me you wanted to go see Ariana Grande"
32:52;32:53;"at Staples Center."
32:53;32:54;"How as cool was that?"
32:54;32:55;"'Cause I knew on the way home,"
32:55;32:57;"you'd be back on my corporate platforms"
32:57;32:58;"talking about it,"
32:58;32:59;"and I knew that the next day"
32:59;33:01;"you'd be back on Netflix streaming"
33:01;33:03;"and you'd be watching TV and movies."
33:03;33:04;"But now you're telling me"
33:04;33:05;"that you're embracing a lifestyle"
33:05;33:07;"that could seriously take away"
33:07;33:10;"eyeballs and ears from the Hollywood corporate machine?"
33:10;33:11;"No, no."
33:11;33:12;"I don't like Jam Bands anymore."
33:12;33:14;"And that's why LA's not a Jam Band town,"
33:14;33:16;"is 'cause big Hollywood can't stand it."
33:16;33:18;"- It was a giant conspiracy."
33:18;33:19;"- Yep."
33:19;33:20;"- Hell of a theory, man."
33:20;33:22;"- They like music up to a point,"
33:22;33:24;"but Jam Band fans, that's a lifestyle."

34:51;34:54;"- My freshman year of college roommate, this guy Nat Keefe..."
34:54;34:55;"- Yeah?"
34:55;34:57;"- Is a--I think a pretty preeminent musician"
34:57;34:59;"in the contemporary bluegrass world."
34:59;35:00;"- Oh, yeah, you told me about him."
35:00;35:02;"- And he has a band called the Hot Buttered Rum Band."
35:02;35:03;"- Right."
35:03;35:04;"- And they, too, are big."
35:04;35:05;"- Right."
35:05;35:07;"- And in San Francisco, where they're from,"
35:07;35:09;"they play big shows, they'll, like, sell to Fillmore."
35:09;35:10;"- And bluegrass is one of those genres"
35:10;35:11;"that you're always surprised to be like,"
35:11;35:13;"""Wow, there's, like, a lot of bluegrass festivals"
35:13;35:14;"around the country."""
35:14;35:16;"- Yeah, and in the summer, they're touring a ton"
35:16;35:17;"and playing, like, big outdoor shows,"
35:17;35:19;"and I'm in occasional touch with him,"
35:19;35:21;"and I'm always like, ""Dude, let me know"
35:21;35:22;"when you're coming through LA."
35:22;35:24;"Like, I'd love to come out and see you."""
35:24;35:26;"He's like, ""Dude, we don't have love in LA."
35:26;35:27;"We don't have fans in LA."""
35:27;35:28;"- Yeah."
35:28;35:30;"- Like, we struggle with playing shows there."
35:30;35:32;"But then they'll, like, sell out to Fillmore"
35:32;35:33;"in San Francisco."
35:33;35:34;"It's, like, super regional."
35:34;35:36;"- The two biggest cities in the same state."
35:36;35:37;"- Yeah."
35:37;35:38;"- And it's night and day."
35:38;35:39;"- Oh, they got some tours."
35:39;35:40;"- Oh, yeah, so they're on tour."
35:40;35:42;"They're hitting Eugene, Oregon, Bend, Oregon, Portland."
35:42;35:44;"So they're covering all of Oregon."
35:44;35:46;"- Yep, Seattle, Winters, California,"
35:46;35:49;"which is, like, kind of northern central valley,"
35:49;35:50;"Berkeley, Sebastopol."
35:50;35:52;"- Whitefish, Montana, Livingston, Montana."
35:52;35:54;"You're telling me that-- - No LA."
35:54;35:56;"- Hot Buttered Rum can do two shows in Montana"
35:56;35:57;"and it won't even come down to LA."
35:57;35:59;"- Maybe we should get Nat on the phone,"
35:59;36:00;"have him call into the show."
36:00;36:03;"Love to get a breakdown of the SoCal bluegrass scene."
36:03;36:05;"- Yeah, maybe it's the same thing."
36:05;36:06;"He's just like, ""I'll tell you, man,"
36:06;36:07;"""it's hostile."
36:07;36:09;"""Hollywood doesn't want bluegrass coming down"
36:09;36:12;"""'cause our music is all about looking to the past,"
36:12;36:15;"""tradition, encouraging people to unplug."""
36:15;36:16;"Imagine that, that-- - Yeah."
36:16;36:19;"- That somebody who spends, you know,"
36:19;36:22;"six hours on their phone, I mean, like a lot of us,"
36:22;36:24;"wake up, you're on your phone all day."
36:24;36:27;"Come home, you throw on Netflix,"
36:27;36:31;"binging Stranger Things or House of Cards or whatever."
36:31;36:34;"- We don't want you listening to acoustic music."
36:34;36:36;"- And the next thing you know,"
36:36;36:38;"suddenly you're into The Grateful Dead and bluegrass."
36:38;36:41;"- You're checking out that Garcia Grissom material."
36:41;36:43;"- Yeah, and the crossover material,"
36:43;36:44;"old and in the way."
36:44;36:47;"And the next thing you know, big Hollywood,"
36:47;36:50;"the kind of tech Hollywood conglomerate,"
36:50;36:52;"suddenly lost hundreds of hours"
36:52;36:53;"of your eyeballs and your ears."
36:53;36:56;"You're sitting on the back porch plucking on a banjo"
36:56;36:58;"because bluegrass encourages its listeners"
36:58;37:01;"to participate in the music in a way that,"
37:01;37:02;"to learn the music, whereas I would say"
37:02;37:05;"the kind of corporate music encourages people"
37:05;37:09;"to just shut up and become soldiers for the music."
37:09;37:10;"- Become an Arianator."
37:11;37:13;"That's an unfortunate Arianator."
37:13;37:14;"- Did I pronounce that?"
37:14;37:18;"- Well, I guess to be fair, her name is Ariana,"
37:18;37:19;"so they're Arianators."
37:19;37:23;"- So it's more like kind of aerating, Arianators,"
37:23;37:24;"not Arianators."
37:24;37:25;"- Right."
37:25;37:26;"- Arianators?"
37:26;37:28;"- Ariana-nators."
37:28;37:29;"- Ariana-ators."
37:29;37:31;"- It sounds too close to Ariana-haters."
37:31;37:33;"I'm a fan of Ariana Grande, but--"
37:33;37:36;"- But she is part of the corporate machine."
37:36;37:37;"- It's not her fault."
37:37;37:38;"She built her own thing,"
37:38;37:40;"and the corporate machine wants to use it."
37:40;37:41;"Ariana seems cool to me."
37:41;37:43;"It wouldn't shock me if she checks out"
37:43;37:46;"from this 1984 reality at some point."
37:46;37:47;"- Starts touring with Twiddle."
37:47;37:49;"- Maybe starts touring with Twiddle."
37:49;37:50;"- Hot buttered rum."
37:50;37:51;"- Although, as I say this,"
37:51;37:53;"I guess it actually makes me worried."
37:53;37:54;"You know why?"
37:54;37:55;"- Where does this put a vampire?"
37:55;37:57;"- Oh, I wasn't even gonna say that."
37:57;37:58;"- Why?"
37:58;37:59;"- I just wasn't thinking about that."
37:59;38:00;"- No, no, but what worries you?"
38:00;38:03;"- What worries me is that Hollywood's been"
38:03;38:06;"in Southern California for over 100 years."
38:06;38:07;"Big Hollywood."
38:07;38:09;"- Hollywood moved to Southern California."
38:09;38:10;"- Kind of."
38:10;38:12;"It did actually move from the East Coast in Chicago."
38:12;38:13;"The film business moved here."
38:13;38:15;"And, you know, so whatever, they set up shop."
38:15;38:16;"- Yep."
38:16;38:17;"- Hollywood, in a very real way,"
38:17;38:19;"helped build this town, modern L.A."
38:19;38:20;"- Mm-hmm."
38:20;38:23;"- So Hollywood already had a base of operations"
38:23;38:24;"when, in the '60s,"
38:24;38:26;"jam bands tried to come through."
38:26;38:27;"Hollywood could repel them."
38:27;38:29;"They could send their thugs, you know,"
38:29;38:32;"that Josh Brolin character in ""Hail, Caesar."""
38:32;38:34;"- Or the one from ""Inherent Vice."""
38:34;38:35;"- Yeah."
38:35;38:37;"They sent the Josh Brolins of the world."
38:37;38:38;"Probably back in the '60s,"
38:38;38:39;"a twiddle-type band would come through."
38:39;38:41;"They'd probably get their asses kicked"
38:41;38:42;"by a guy in a three-piece suit."
38:42;38:45;"- Brolin's just like, ""No country for jam-throwing, man."""
38:45;38:46;"- Yeah."
38:46;38:47;"- It's a combination of--"
38:47;38:49;"- ""Stay the hell out of Southern California."""
38:49;38:53;"- It's a combination of Brolin's later period characters"
38:53;38:54;"and Anton Chigurh."
38:54;38:56;"- Yeah, exactly."
38:56;38:59;"So Hollywood has already had this base of operations"
38:59;39:01;"to keep the jam bands out."
39:01;39:03;"- Yeah, the Dead really didn't have a big--"
39:03;39:05;"like, a ton of shows here either."
39:05;39:06;"- And then when they did have shows,"
39:06;39:09;"I feel like a lot of them were outside of Los Angeles proper."
39:09;39:11;"- Yeah. Ventura County Fairgrounds."
39:11;39:13;"- Yeah. Anaheim."
39:13;39:15;"But so Hollywood already ran this town."
39:15;39:16;"- Yeah."
39:16;39:18;"- Now, up in San Francisco, it's kind of the opposite."
39:18;39:21;"Nobody was running the town at first."
39:21;39:24;"And in the '60s, you know, you'd get a cheap house"
39:24;39:27;"and you'd eat an Ashbury and it was a very fertile scene."
39:27;39:29;"The eyes of the world were looking toward San Francisco"
39:29;39:31;"as a place that you could let your freak flag fly."
39:31;39:34;"And sadly, as many people have discussed,"
39:34;39:36;"San Francisco's been one of the biggest changes"
39:36;39:40;"of any American city in that it went from a crunchy town"
39:40;39:43;"to a crazy influx of capital"
39:43;39:44;"and a new business that took over,"
39:44;39:46;"which of course is tech."
39:46;39:48;"Computers, tech, Internet, whatever you want to call it."
39:48;39:53;"So actually, one of the hungriest industries ever--"
39:53;39:56;"way hungrier than Hollywood, Big Brother Tech--"
39:56;39:58;"that wants your eyes and ear balls,"
39:58;40:00;"they're sitting in the backyard of the Grateful Dead, man."
40:00;40:03;"So literally, the place that jam band music comes from,"
40:03;40:06;"which is all about being in the moment,"
40:06;40:07;"hanging out in a space,"
40:07;40:10;"checking out for hours at a time,"
40:10;40:11;"and even sometimes weeks at a time"
40:11;40:12;"if you go and follow the band,"
40:12;40:14;"there's a battle in their own backyard."
40:14;40:15;"- Heavy, man."
40:15;40:18;"- That's why Vermont is truly the jam band capital now."
40:18;40:21;"- You just got Ben & Jerry's, you got Bernie."
40:21;40:22;"- You got Bernie holding it down."
40:22;40:25;"I guess it's no surprise that somebody like Mahali,"
40:25;40:26;"Jersey guy like me,"
40:26;40:28;"listening to Phish and the Dead,"
40:28;40:31;"wants to start a jam band in the 2000s."
40:31;40:33;"A guy like Mahali, he's going to Burlington, Vermont,"
40:33;40:34;"he's not going to the Bay."
40:34;40:36;"He wants to be as far away from Hollywood"
40:36;40:37;"and big tech as he can be."
40:37;40:39;"He wants to be near Ben & Jerry's."
40:39;40:41;"- I have a theory too, maybe with the East Coast,"
40:41;40:43;"after getting pummeled by the winter,"
40:43;40:45;"it's summertime in the East Coast,"

52:59;53:00;"I'm just gonna eat them."
53:00;53:01;"That's a palate cleanser."
53:01;53:03;"I don't like all this, like, sugar kind of just--"
53:03;53:05;"- I can see how this would be addictive."
53:05;53:07;"Eating this is just as crazy as eating"
53:07;53:09;"Frosted Flakes or any of these other sugars."
53:09;53:10;"- I don't know if I want Frosted Flakes"
53:10;53:12;"or any of these other sugary cereals."
53:12;53:14;"Okay, let's throw on some music."
53:14;53:15;"I need a little break."
53:15;53:18;"I gotta process this crazy chemical roller coaster"

58:52;58:53;"Now's the perfect time."
58:53;58:57;"I mean, like we said, the news has just been getting more and more TC."
58:57;59:00;"The frequency of TC news stories is just going through the roof."
59:00;59:04;"Last week, Bebe Rexha, friend of the show,"
59:04;59:06;"my former table mate."
59:06;59:08;"I think it's fair to say that you broke bread with Bebe."
59:08;59:10;"I quite literally broke bread with Bebe."
59:10;59:11;"We were at the same table."
59:11;59:14;"I think if you sit at the same table and you break bread,"
59:14;59:16;"and they were coming around with pretzel rolls and stuff,"
59:16;59:18;"so I literally broke bread."
59:18;59:23;"So Bebe Rexha has teamed up with Lay's to introduce three new--"
59:23;59:24;"So she teamed up with Lay's brand,"
59:24;59:26;"but she teamed up with Frito-Lay Corporation."
59:26;59:30;"She teamed up with Lay's to introduce three new chip flavors"
59:30;59:31;"inspired by music."
59:31;59:33;"I mean, did we write this?"
59:33;59:34;"Did we dream this?"
59:34;59:37;"One of our favorite artists, shout out to Seinfeld,"
59:37;59:39;"who sounds like his exile is almost over,"
59:39;59:41;"but we know he's a massive Bebe Rexha fan."
59:41;59:44;"So for Bebe Rexha to team up with Lay's,"
59:44;59:46;"but not just some throwaway thing."
59:46;59:50;"They actually got in the lab together and came up with Lay's flavors"
59:50;59:51;"that are inspired by music."
59:51;59:53;"I mean, it's unbelievable."
59:53;59:55;"So there's three chips."
59:55;01:00:00;"We got wavy electric lime and sea salt, which represents pop music."
01:00:00;01:00:01;"Obviously."
01:00:01;01:00:02;"Yeah, because it's wavy electric."
01:00:02;01:00:04;"That makes sense."
01:00:04;01:00:08;"Then we got flaming hot dill pickle remix, which represents hip hop."
01:00:08;01:00:10;"Questionable."
01:00:10;01:00:14;"Flaming hot dill pickle."
01:00:14;01:00:18;"And then we got kettle cooked classic beer cheese, which represents rock."
01:00:18;01:00:20;"That one's about right."
01:00:20;01:00:21;"Beer cheese."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"Yeah, see, I thought it said originally--"
01:00:23;01:00:26;"I thought it said beer chase, like a beer chaser."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"Oh, like you just took a shot and then you chased with some beer."
01:00:28;01:00:30;"And I was like, okay, that sounds about right."
01:00:30;01:00:35;"Well, the one thing I can't tell is it's beer cheese or it's beer and cheese."
01:00:35;01:00:37;"I don't know what beer cheese is."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"Is there like a type of cheese that's made with beer?"
01:00:39;01:00:40;"Gross."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"That sounds like something."
01:00:41;01:00:44;"That seems like you're at some kind of like gastro pub and they're just like,"
01:00:44;01:00:45;"can I get a burger?"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"And they're like, just so you know, our burger comes with aged Guinness"
01:00:48;01:00:51;"infused beer cheese, tomato chutney."
01:00:51;01:00:55;"You know, like is beer cheese like a foodie thing or is it like just a--"
01:00:55;01:00:59;"I think it's like Midwestern like bar finger food."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"Oh, yeah."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"That's my guess."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"Maybe it's kind of a German Midwestern thing."
01:01:02;01:01:06;"Okay, so anyway, I think of all of them, the kettle cook classic beer cheese"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"representing rock makes a lot of sense."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"So she didn't just throw her name on this."
01:01:10;01:01:14;"She also remixed versions of her new single right here, right now,"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"to match the profiles of each new chip flavor."
01:01:16;01:01:20;"As part of Lay's Turn Up the Flavor program."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"This is unbelievable."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"I love the program."
01:01:24;01:01:28;"I love when just like food corporations have programs and initiatives."
01:01:28;01:01:33;"It's like as if they're like an NGO or like a government department like the UN."
01:01:33;01:01:37;"The UN has like a program to, you know, end child slavery somewhere."
01:01:37;01:01:41;"And it's like we have a Turn Up the Flavor program."
01:01:41;01:01:44;"So it's some kind of thing where if you get the bag,"
01:01:44;01:01:49;"you get a download code to get the version of the song."
01:01:49;01:01:54;"So the new remixed version of the song is inspired by the chip?"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"To match the profiles."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"It's a chicken or the egg thing. It matches it."
01:01:58;01:02:02;"So I also wonder if this is the type of thing, like I'd love to,"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"no pun intended, crunch the numbers on this."
01:02:04;01:02:07;"Because I wonder if this is one of these things where, I know BB Rex is a big star."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"I'm sure this is making some waves."
01:02:09;01:02:14;"But if you're like, hey, Lay's, how many people actually used the kettle cook"
01:02:14;01:02:19;"classic beer cheese download code to actually download the rock remix"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"of Right Here Right Now?"
01:02:21;01:02:24;"They might just be like, globally, 82."
01:02:24;01:02:27;"You know what I mean? Lay's, share the numbers with us."
01:03:24;01:03:29;"She's not on the bag at all."
01:03:29;01:03:31;"I mean, how are you supposed to even know about this?"
01:03:31;01:03:32;"She's not on the front of the bag."
01:03:32;01:03:35;"Short of if you do an internet radio program and someone prints this out for you."
01:03:35;01:03:38;"Well, I guess if you're a BB fan or you follow her on social media."
01:03:38;01:03:40;"Well, let's check out this video. What's she got to say?"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"Hey, I'm BB Rexha."
01:03:42;01:03:47;"I'm here in the studio doing something completely different than anything I've ever done before."
01:03:47;01:03:51;"Flavor and music can trigger such powerful emotions."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"Wait, pause it."
01:03:52;01:03:53;"Okay."
01:03:53;01:03:58;"Flavor and music can get me feeling all sorts of emotions?"
01:03:58;01:04:02;"Flavor and music can trigger powerful emotions."
01:04:02;01:04:05;"Okay. I mean, she's not wrong about that."
01:04:05;01:04:09;"I can't think of too many times in my life flavor triggered an emotion."
01:04:09;01:04:11;"Maybe a memory."
01:04:11;01:04:13;"Yeah, maybe a memory. Maybe..."
01:04:13;01:04:21;"I know that there's extreme stories like somebody who was like a refugee and hadn't tasted maybe a type of food in 40 years"
01:04:21;01:04:24;"and had all these repressed memories of being five years old in a war zone."
01:04:24;01:04:31;"I imagine you have that Proustian thing where then you taste something and you're suddenly remembering stuff you didn't even know you remembered."
01:04:31;01:04:33;"I guess that's probably the kind of thing she's referencing."
01:04:33;01:04:36;"I've never experienced that. I've been lucky in life."
01:04:36;01:04:37;"But maybe you need decades."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"Maybe when I'm older I'll taste something and it'll just take me back."
01:04:39;01:04:42;"There's a very powerful scene in Ratatouille."
01:04:42;01:04:43;"I've never seen that film."
01:04:43;01:04:46;"The food critic tastes the Ratatouille."
01:04:46;01:04:47;"Yeah."
01:04:47;01:04:50;"He's like a snooty, highfalutin food critic."
01:04:50;01:04:55;"And the shot goes into... you see him eat it and then the camera pushes in..."
01:04:55;01:04:56;"Into his nose?"
01:04:56;01:04:58;"No, into his eyeball and you go into his memory."
01:04:58;01:05:01;"And he goes back to being a child and eating his mom's Ratatouille."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"And then he's like..."
01:05:02;01:05:03;"And he's won over."
01:05:03;01:05:07;"Why am I such a pretentious f***? I used to just be a kid who just enjoyed things that were good."
01:05:07;01:05:08;"40 years ago."
01:05:08;01:05:10;"Wow. Okay, so she's right. Let's keep going."
01:05:10;01:05:13;"Different genres of music can get me feeling certain ways."
01:05:13;01:05:16;"And the same goes for different flavors."
01:05:16;01:05:20;"So, what if you paired the two together?"
01:05:20;01:05:24;"Now that would be a crazy sensory experience."
01:05:38;01:05:39;"Oh, here's the remix."
01:05:39;01:05:41;"Here's the dill pickle remix."
01:05:41;01:05:43;"Dude, this is the hip-hop remix."
01:05:43;01:05:50;"As Seinfeld pointed out, they used the crunching chip as a drum sound."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"What does the dill pickle have to do with hip-hop?"
01:05:52;01:05:53;"Well, it's Flamin' Hot."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"Look, this is the rock version."
01:06:06;01:06:09;"Okay, so you know what? I gotta say, this..."
01:06:09;01:06:13;"What at first, to me, seemed like maybe a kind of just like lightweight..."
01:06:13;01:06:17;"Bebe Rex is a popular singer. We need somebody."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"You know, just kind of not a very thought-through thing."
01:06:19;01:06:22;"Actually, after watching that, I realized there is something interesting here."
01:06:22;01:06:24;"They're building a multimedia..."
01:06:24;01:06:25;"Multisensory."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"A multisensory experience."
01:06:27;01:06:31;"Which I guess is similar to what Ariana Grande did with her vaguely psychedelic..."
01:06:31;01:06:33;"I wonder if Ariana called a..."
01:06:33;01:06:34;"Bebe."
01:06:34;01:06:35;"Is it Bebe?"
01:06:35;01:06:36;"Bebe?"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"It was like, ""Hey, how'd that work out for you?"""
01:06:39;01:06:40;"It's Bebe."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"Bebe."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"If Ariana called up Bebe and was like,"
01:06:44;01:06:48;"""Hey, I'm thinking about teaming up with Starbucks. How'd that work out with Lay's for you?"""
01:06:48;01:06:49;"And she would..."
01:06:49;01:06:51;"Love to be a fly on the wall for that one."
01:06:51;01:06:52;"I wonder if they talk."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"Do they have beef?"
01:06:53;01:06:54;"No, but Ariana is..."
01:06:54;01:06:57;"I mean, Bebe's crushing it, but Ariana is a..."
01:06:57;01:06:58;"Kind of a different level."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"She's been in the game longer."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"But maybe they could still have a relationship."
01:07:02;01:07:05;"Yeah, maybe she was like, ""Bebe, you're my canary in the coal mine."""
01:07:05;01:07:10;"We're both interested in the intersection of flavor and music."
01:07:10;01:07:14;"I see you did some really kind of interesting multisensory experience."
01:07:14;01:07:16;"I'm thinking about doing the same thing with Starbucks."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"Yeah, how did it go?"
01:07:17;01:07:22;"And Bebe was probably like, ""Well, I'm happy to report we did something truly groundbreaking"
01:07:22;01:07:25;"to eat that Flamin' Hot Dill Pickle while listening to the hip-hop remix."""
01:07:25;01:07:27;"Yeah, it is kind of all tied in."
01:07:27;01:07:30;"Do you mind if I ask how many downloads of those remixes you got?"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"Um..."
01:07:31;01:07:32;"Globally?"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"Well, for the pop one..."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"No, no, I want to know about the Kettle Cook Classic Beer Cheese."
01:07:36;01:07:38;"What kind of numbers did that download put up?"
01:07:38;01:07:42;"Well, some of the numbers are still coming in from some of our international partners,"
01:07:42;01:07:45;"but we're looking at almost 100."
01:07:45;01:07:46;"Thousand?"
01:07:46;01:07:47;"No, ma'am."
01:07:47;01:07:53;"Sometimes with these big campaigns, that metric is besides the point."
01:07:53;01:07:58;"It's like, maybe only 82 people downloaded the Kettle Cook Classic Beer Cheese rock remix"
01:07:58;01:08:00;"of Bebe's single, but..."
01:08:00;01:08:01;"True Bebeheads."
01:08:01;01:08:06;"True Bebeheads heard it, and then the casual fans like us are here talking about it."
01:08:06;01:08:11;"So in 10 years, somebody might say, ""Hey, can you talk about how that Kettle Cook Classic"
01:08:11;01:08:14;"Beer Cheese rock remix of Right Here Right Now sounded?"""
01:08:14;01:08:16;"And we'll say no, and say, ""But do you remember that whole campaign?"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"Do you remember when Bebe teamed up with Lay's?"""
01:08:18;01:08:19;"Vividly."
01:08:20;01:08:21;"And that's really all that matters."
01:08:21;01:08:22;"Yep."
01:08:22;01:08:25;"And Bebe has declared that her fandom is called Rexars."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"The Rexars and the Arianators."
01:08:27;01:08:30;"How do you say, what is it?"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"Ariana..."
01:08:31;01:08:32;"Ari..."
01:08:32;01:08:33;"Arian..."
01:08:33;01:08:34;"Arianators."
01:08:34;01:08:36;"It's like legitimately hard to say."
01:08:36;01:08:37;"Arianators."
01:08:37;01:08:39;"Wait, so we have another Bebe video?"
01:08:39;01:08:46;"Yeah, I haven't watched this, but there's something about her and this chip promoting the voice."
01:08:46;01:08:47;"Oh, interesting."
01:08:47;01:08:49;"Which I feel is just sort of like, almost like..."
01:08:49;01:08:50;"Even more multi-platform."
01:08:50;01:08:51;"Exactly."
01:08:51;01:08:52;"Lay's music."
01:08:52;01:08:53;"All right, let's see this."
01:08:53;01:08:54;"What's up, boys fans?"
01:08:54;01:08:59;"It's Bebe Rexha, and this season I'm partnering with Lay's, and together with The Voice, we're"
01:08:59;01:09:04;"making sure you don't miss out on discovering new flavors, music, and experiences with the"
01:09:04;01:09:06;"comeback stage presented by Lay's."
01:09:06;01:09:10;"And as the fifth coach, I'll be adding my own personal flavor and helping the artists discover"
01:09:10;01:09:11;"their own."
01:09:11;01:09:16;"Lay's is going to be rolling out three delicious limited edition flavors inspired by music that"
01:09:16;01:09:17;"you don't want to miss."
01:09:17;01:09:21;"So get ready to turn up the flavor this season on The Voice."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"Right here, right now."
01:09:23;01:09:26;"Right here, right now."
01:09:26;01:09:27;"Is that a new single?"
01:09:27;01:09:28;"That's the song."
01:09:28;01:09:31;"Is it a weird rewrite of the Van Halen song?"
01:09:31;01:09:33;"Wait, wasn't there used to be some other song?"
01:09:33;01:09:35;"Right here, right now."
01:09:35;01:09:37;"I just think of the Van Halen one from like early '90s."
01:09:37;01:09:39;"Right now."
01:09:39;01:09:41;"I mean, it's just, it's classic."
01:09:41;01:09:44;"Oh yeah, I'm thinking Fatboy Slim right here, right now."
01:09:44;01:09:47;"Whatever, you know, that's an evergreen title."
01:09:47;01:09:48;"Oh, and then there's Jesus Jones."
01:09:48;01:09:51;"Right here, right now."
01:09:51;01:09:53;"Okay, there's a Kylie Minogue song."
01:09:53;01:09:55;"Look, everybody's got a Right Here, Right Now."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"It's all about what you do with it."
01:09:57;01:09:58;"Just like there's a lot of sunflowers."
01:09:58;01:10:01;"Oh yeah, a lot of sunflowers."
01:10:01;01:10:02;"Oh wait, I almost forgot about that."
01:10:02;01:10:03;"New music's out."
01:10:03;01:10:04;"All right, let's shift gears."
01:10:04;01:10:07;"Maybe we should shift gears and play those real quick before we do the top five."
01:10:07;01:10:09;"We just dropped another two songs."
01:10:09;01:10:12;"The first two were Harmony Hall and 2021."
01:10:12;01:10:15;"Then this past week we dropped Sunflower and Big Blue."
01:10:15;01:10:16;"Great."
01:10:16;01:10:17;"So have you heard these?"
01:10:17;01:10:18;"Have you heard Sunflower?"
01:10:18;01:10:19;"Probably, I just, I mean."
01:10:19;01:10:21;"Yeah, maybe you haven't."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"Anyway, this is Sunflower."
01:10:22;01:10:23;"This one's with Steve Lacey."
01:10:23;01:10:24;"Who's Steve Lacey?"
01:10:24;01:10:25;"He's in that band, The Internet."
01:10:25;01:10:27;"He's also a great solo artist."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"He's a young dude."
01:10:28;01:10:30;"He hit me up on Twitter like years ago."
01:10:30;01:10:34;"Have you heard this one?"
01:10:34;01:10:35;"Yeah, I have."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"Oh yeah, I showed you that little video."
01:10:36;01:10:37;"This is the real, like, this one."
01:10:37;01:10:39;"Oh, you said you thought this was psychedelic."
01:10:39;01:10:40;"Like real 60s."
01:10:51;01:10:57;"Sunflower in the morning, standing in the garden."
01:10:57;01:11:01;"All before you wait."
01:11:01;01:11:07;"No power can compare you out into the daylight."
01:11:07;01:11:11;"Let that evil way."
01:11:11;01:11:16;"Strange thoughts are haunting us."
01:11:16;01:11:18;"What day we met today?"
01:11:18;01:11:20;"The harmonies from Steve."
01:11:39;01:11:45;"Sunflower in the evening, standing in the garden."
01:11:45;01:11:47;"This one's going to go off live."
01:11:47;01:11:49;"Oh yeah, we've been working on some extended versions."
01:11:49;01:11:53;"Yeah, it seems perfect for that."
01:11:58;01:12:03;"Strange thoughts are haunting us."
01:12:03;01:12:07;"What day we met today?"
01:12:07;01:12:09;"Well, I don't know."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"This part's funny."
01:12:28;01:12:30;"Kind of playful, prog."
01:12:35;01:12:37;"It's a tight 218."
01:12:37;01:12:39;"Loving these song lengths."
01:12:39;01:12:40;"Yeah, so that's Sunflower."
01:12:40;01:12:41;"Tight."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"And this one's Big Blue."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"I feel like I played this for you pretty early on."
01:12:44;01:12:48;"Big Blue, for once in my life I felt close to you."
01:12:48;01:12:51;"I was so overcome with emotion."
01:12:51;01:12:54;"When I was hurt and in need of affection."
01:12:54;01:12:58;"When I was tired and I couldn't go home."
01:12:58;01:13:01;"Then you offered protection."
01:13:01;01:13:04;"So am I learning my lesson?"
01:13:04;01:13:10;"Or am I back on my own?"
01:13:10;01:13:14;"Big Blue, for once in my life I felt close to you."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"I was so overcome with emotion."
01:13:17;01:13:20;"When I was hurt and in need of affection."
01:13:20;01:13:24;"When I was tired and I couldn't go home."
01:13:24;01:13:27;"Then you offered protection."
01:13:27;01:13:31;"So am I learning my lesson?"
01:13:31;01:13:35;"Or am I back on my own?"
01:13:35;01:13:37;"Who's playing that acoustic lead?"
01:13:37;01:13:39;"The lead stuff is Greg Lees."
01:13:39;01:13:41;"You met him once at the studio."
01:13:41;01:13:42;"Did I?"
01:13:42;01:13:43;"He's the guy who plays pedal steel too."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"Oh, cool."
01:13:44;01:13:45;"Like he's been around a minute."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"Oh yeah, he's like a legend."
01:13:47;01:13:50;"When I was tired and I couldn't go home."
01:13:50;01:13:53;"Then you offered protection."
01:13:53;01:13:57;"So am I learning my lesson?"
01:13:57;01:14:02;"Or am I back on my own?"
01:14:02;01:14:06;"Big Blue, for once in my life I felt close to you."
01:14:06;01:14:09;"I was so overcome with emotion."
01:14:09;01:14:12;"When I was hurt and in need of affection."
01:14:12;01:14:16;"When I was tired and I couldn't go home."
01:14:16;01:14:18;"This is beautiful, man."
01:14:18;01:14:19;"Oh, thank you."
01:14:19;01:14:22;"So am I learning my lesson?"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"Or am I back on my own?"
01:14:25;01:14:28;"Also, is that under three?"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"This one's under two."
01:14:30;01:14:32;"So wait, there was no change in that."
01:14:32;01:14:35;"That was just sort of like the same part,"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"sort of like just terraced up and back down."
01:14:37;01:14:38;"Yeah, exactly."
01:14:38;01:14:42;"I was saying to Zane last week when I was back here"
01:14:42;01:14:45;"doing interviews with him that that's one where,"
01:14:45;01:14:48;"you know, and also this album's 18 songs."
01:14:48;01:14:51;"So it's like been kind of important that there's a,"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"I knew that if there was going to be an 18 song album,"
01:14:53;01:14:54;"we had to keep some of them short."
01:14:54;01:14:57;"So I didn't beat myself up about letting a song like Big Blue"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"be a minute 48."
01:14:59;01:15:01;"But we really thought for a second,"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"do I need to change the lyrics every time"
01:15:03;01:15:05;"and have it be like a four-verse thing?"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"The more I thought about it, I was like--"
01:15:07;01:15:08;"It's the same lyrics too, right?"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"It's the same lyric over and over again."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"But I was just like, that lyric is the song."
01:15:11;01:15:14;"It's like a little poem and the music changes."
01:15:14;01:15:16;"And I think the music changes drastically."
01:15:16;01:15:19;"Because the original part I did with DJ Dahi,"
01:15:19;01:15:20;"and that's when I wrote the,"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"♪ Ba-dum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum ♪"
01:15:22;01:15:23;"And he had his like, (imitates a bird)"
01:15:23;01:15:24;"And then it just changes so much"
01:15:24;01:15:25;"when the acoustics come in."
01:15:25;01:15:27;"So I was like, that feels right."
01:15:27;01:15:29;"Warm acoustics."
01:15:29;01:15:31;"And we're going to definitely extend that one live too."
01:15:31;01:15:32;"All right."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"I think it's time for the top five."
01:15:34;01:15:37;"It's time for the top five."
01:15:37;01:15:41;"Five on iTunes."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"So this week on the top five,"
01:15:43;01:15:47;"we're doing the top five songs on iTunes right now in 2019"
01:15:47;01:15:50;"and comparing them with the top five Billboard hits of 1985."
01:15:50;01:15:52;"Why 1985?"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"Well, according to my sheet here, it says,"
01:15:54;01:15:57;"the year that Sour Patch Kids were rebranded"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"and introduced to the US."
01:15:59;01:16:01;"They were previously known as Mars Men."
01:16:01;01:16:02;"What?"
01:16:02;01:16:03;"That's a red letter date."
01:16:03;01:16:04;"That's a real bombshell."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"I'd never, have you ever heard of Mars Men before?"
01:16:06;01:16:07;"No."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"What does that say about the infantilization"
01:16:08;01:16:11;"of American culture that in 1985,"
01:16:11;01:16:14;"Mars Men had to be downgraded to Sour Patch Kids?"
01:16:14;01:16:15;"What's that about?"
01:16:15;01:16:17;"That's a dissertation right there."
01:16:17;01:16:18;"I want to dig into that."
01:16:18;01:16:21;"I need to do some more research, but Mars Men."
01:16:21;01:16:24;"Seems like a great use of your time."
01:16:24;01:16:25;"All right."
01:16:25;01:16:26;"Let's get right in."
01:16:26;01:16:29;"The number five song in 1985."
01:16:29;01:16:33;"Starting big, right off the bat."
01:16:33;01:16:34;"Madonna."
01:16:34;01:16:40;"Yep."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"Produced by Nile Rodgers."
01:16:42;01:16:43;"Who's that again?"
01:16:43;01:16:46;"From Chic."
01:16:46;01:16:47;"Oh, come on."
01:16:47;01:16:49;"I got a weird blind spot with Nile's,"
01:16:49;01:16:51;"Nile's Rodgers."
01:16:51;01:16:53;"Nile Rodgers or Niles Rodgers?"
01:16:53;01:16:54;"Nile Rodgers."
01:16:55;01:16:59;"He's like, played guitar in Chic and wrote all the songs."
01:16:59;01:17:00;"Yeah, I don't know Chic either."
01:17:00;01:17:01;"Oh, come on."
01:17:01;01:17:02;"It's a weird blind spot."
01:17:02;01:17:05;"You know, like the good times that rappers light them."
01:17:05;01:17:06;"(singing)"
01:17:06;01:17:07;"Okay."
01:17:07;01:17:08;"Oh, wait, was I starting to sing?"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"I was getting confused with Another One Bites the Dust."
01:17:10;01:17:14;"And so Chic had all these hits and then he produced Madonna,"
01:17:14;01:17:17;"he produced David Bowie, Duran Duran."
01:17:17;01:17:18;"You're familiar with his work."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"For sure."
01:17:19;01:17:23;"He and Bernard from Chic also did like the really classic"
01:17:23;01:17:26;"Diana Ross '79, '80 comeback stuff."
01:17:26;01:17:27;"Oh, okay."
01:17:27;01:17:31;"(singing)"
01:17:31;01:17:32;"Okay."
01:17:32;01:17:33;"He's incredible."
01:17:33;01:17:36;"(singing)"
01:17:36;01:17:39;"I guess this song was like a bit of a turning point."
01:17:39;01:17:43;"(singing)"
01:17:43;01:17:44;"I bet this is one of those, you know,"
01:17:44;01:17:47;"we always talk about certain songs that somebody from a"
01:17:47;01:17:49;"previous generation probably heard and was just like,"
01:17:49;01:17:50;"""What the f---?"""
01:17:50;01:17:51;"Right."
01:17:51;01:17:55;"But just like some big Lebowski type hippie who's, you know,"
01:17:55;01:17:59;"like super anti-materialist, like deadhead."
01:17:59;01:18:02;"And then just like 1985, every time they turn on the radio,"
01:18:02;01:18:06;"it's just, ""We are living in a material world and I'm a"
01:18:06;01:18:07;"material girl."""
01:18:07;01:18:09;"And you just have to like no context for it,"
01:18:09;01:18:12;"just be like, ""What the f--- happened?"""
01:18:12;01:18:13;"And not to say that they're--"
01:18:13;01:18:14;"So you know what, man, she's right."
01:18:14;01:18:18;"Yeah, I mean, arguably, Madonna's just telling it like it is."
01:18:18;01:18:20;"There's a kind of a world weariness in this song."
01:18:20;01:18:22;"Yeah, I was going to say, is there like a critique in this song?"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"I haven't really listened to the lyrics closely."
01:18:24;01:18:26;"I think there's a pragmatism."
01:18:26;01:18:27;"Right."
01:18:27;01:18:30;"That's kind of like you old hippies can debate what's right"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"and wrong until the cows come home,"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"but in the meantime, we're living in a material world"

01:40:31;01:40:34;"- A thrilling roller coaster that the whole family can enjoy."
01:40:34;01:40:36;"Like, are those from articles?"

01:40:46;01:40:50;"- And she definitely thought they had chemistry in ""Starsborne""?"
01:40:50;01:40:51;"- Yes, for sure. The film."
01:40:51;01:40:54;"- They always struck me as an odd couple in the movie,"
01:40:54;01:40:56;"but I guess that's part of the vibe."
01:40:56;01:40:57;"- Yeah."

01:40:58;01:41:00;"about the awkwardness of their courtship."
01:41:00;01:41:01;"- Yeah."
01:41:01;01:41:03;"- I mean, I think it's a good thing."
01:41:03;01:41:04;"- Yeah."

01:41:46;01:42:14;"- I mean, I think it's a good thing."
01:42:14;01:42:41;"- Yeah."
01:42:41;01:42:42;"- Shallow finally went to number one."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"That was an exciting thing."
01:42:44;01:42:45;"- So that's all post Oscars?"
01:42:45;01:42:47;"- Yeah, it put it over the edge."
01:42:47;01:42:51;"And I think the Gaga fans who were called the Little Monsters waged a campaign to get her"
01:42:51;01:42:52;"that number one."
01:42:52;01:42:53;"- Is that real?"
01:42:53;01:42:54;"- Yeah, they're called Little Monsters."
01:42:54;01:42:58;"Easier to say than, I'm not even gonna try."
01:42:58;01:43:03;"The number one song this week in 1985, REO Speedwagon."
01:43:03;01:43:05;"I feel like they don't come up enough on the show."
01:43:05;01:43:06;"- Big power ballad here?"
01:43:06;01:43:07;"- Can't Fight This Feeling."
01:43:07;01:43:08;"I don't even know if I know this one."
01:43:08;01:43:09;"- I love this song."
01:43:09;01:43:10;"- I'm gonna know this right when I hear it."
01:43:10;01:43:11;"- You're gonna know it."
01:43:11;01:43:12;"This song rules."
01:43:12;01:43:13;"- Does it?"
01:43:13;01:43:14;"- Mm-hmm."
01:43:14;01:43:23;"- But is it like a pale imitation of those great Chicago '80s power ballads?"
01:43:23;01:43:24;"- I wouldn't say it's a pale imitation."
01:43:24;01:43:32;"I would say it's like a solid lateral move from '80s Satara."
01:43:32;01:43:38;"Like if Peter Satara wrote this, he would have been stoked."
01:43:38;01:43:41;"- Yeah."
01:43:41;01:43:48;"- Written by Kevin Cronin."
01:43:48;01:43:58;"- Who I believe is the singer."
01:43:58;01:44:01;"- Really what the song is about was about my inability to have the courage to express"
01:44:01;01:44:02;"myself."
01:44:02;01:44:05;"I was brought up in an Irish Catholic family and you're taught to always keep a bright"
01:44:05;01:44:10;"face, always act like everything was okay, even if maybe everything on the inside wasn't"
01:44:10;01:44:11;"so okay."
01:44:11;01:44:12;"- Yeah, it's heavy."
01:44:12;01:44:15;"So that's something I've struggled with and over the years I've gotten better at."
01:44:15;01:44:18;"- Therapy, man."
01:44:18;01:44:26;"Do you know this song?"
01:44:26;01:44:27;"- We haven't gotten the chorus yet, have we?"
01:44:27;01:44:28;"- No, this is like the..."
01:44:28;01:44:29;"- This is the pre-chorus?"
01:44:29;01:44:30;"- The bridge, or yeah."
01:44:30;01:44:31;"It just keeps climbing."
01:44:31;01:44:32;"- Approaching a minute 30."
01:44:32;01:44:33;"- I'm gonna know this one."
01:46:32;01:46:41;"- I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might."
01:46:41;01:46:47;"'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore."
01:46:47;01:46:48;"- All right."
01:46:48;01:46:49;"I see that."
01:46:49;01:46:50;"There's some craft in these songs."
01:46:50;01:46:51;"- You seem lukewarm on it."
01:46:51;01:46:52;"I'm stoked."
01:46:52;01:46:53;"- You know what it is?"
01:46:53;01:46:54;"Last time we were getting in '80s power ballads"
01:46:54;01:46:55;"and we listened to those Chicago ones,"
01:46:55;01:46:56;"I was just like so in on those."
01:46:56;01:46:57;"- Oh, those are sick."
01:46:57;01:46:58;"- That I just went too deep,"
01:46:58;01:46:59;"and now this just,"
01:46:59;01:47:00;"I can't fully give this proper credit."
01:47:00;01:47:01;"- Yeah, I know."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"I was in a corporate retail environment recently"
01:47:02;01:47:03;"and I heard,"
01:47:03;01:47:04;"♪ I am the man who will fight for your honor ♪"
01:47:04;01:47:05;"- Oh yeah, from the Karate Kid 2 soundtrack."
01:47:05;01:47:06;"- That was like, this is sick."
01:47:06;01:47:07;"- Solo."
01:47:07;01:47:08;"Solo Saterra."
01:47:08;01:47:09;"- Oh yeah, I'm so in."
01:47:09;01:47:10;"- We need justice for Peter Saterra."
01:47:10;01:47:11;"I don't think we ever went deep,"
01:47:11;01:47:12;"but I think he's got some bad blood"
01:47:12;01:47:13;"with the other guys in Chicago or something."
01:47:13;01:47:14;"- Well, he was not in that doc."
01:47:14;01:47:15;"- Right."
01:47:15;01:47:16;"- The Chicago doc."
01:47:16;01:47:17;"- And they seem to be dismissive of him."
01:47:17;01:47:18;"- Yeah, it seemed like,"
01:47:18;01:47:19;"I don't know,"
01:47:19;01:47:20;"I don't know if it's just me,"
01:47:20;01:47:21;"but I think it's just me."
01:47:21;01:47:22;"- Yeah, I think it's just me."
01:47:22;01:47:23;"- I think it's just me."
01:47:24;01:47:25;"- Mr. Saterra at that time decided"
01:47:25;01:47:26;"that he no longer wanted to participate"
01:47:26;01:47:27;"in the second European leg of the tour"
01:47:27;01:47:28;"and we informed Mr. Saterra"
01:47:28;01:47:29;"that we would be terminating his contract"
01:47:29;01:47:30;"with the Chicago corporation."
01:47:30;01:47:31;"I wonder if it's a slight,"
01:47:31;01:47:32;"Steve Miller, Jerry."
01:47:32;01:47:33;"Okay, we're gonna go deep on Chicago one day."
01:47:33;01:47:34;"- Yeah, I'm gonna go deep on Chicago."
01:47:34;01:47:35;"- Okay, we're gonna go deep on Chicago."
01:47:35;01:47:36;"- I'm gonna go deep on Chicago."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"- I don't know who that is, really."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"- The Jonas Brothers, three brothers from New Jersey,"
01:48:09;01:48:11;"so they're already inclined to like them."
01:48:11;01:48:13;"They became like a very popular boy band."
01:48:13;01:48:16;"Three brothers, they're probably, they're really young."
01:48:16;01:48:19;"They had a TV show on the Disney Channel"
01:48:19;01:48:21;"and they'd be huge playing stadiums."
01:48:21;01:48:24;"Then they got older and kind of stopped doing that"
01:48:24;01:48:27;"and some of them had pretty successful solo careers."
01:48:27;01:48:30;"- Well, one of them was in this movie called Goat,"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"which is this like crazy frat boy film."
01:48:32;01:48:35;"- Oh, it's probably Nick Jonas, I think he acts the most."
01:48:35;01:48:39;"And Joe Jonas was once in a Vampire Weekend video"
01:48:39;01:48:42;"and I always thought he was like a super nice, cool guy."
01:48:42;01:48:43;"You see him around here and there."
01:48:43;01:48:45;"They got the band back together."
