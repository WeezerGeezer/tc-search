00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis back again."
00:02;00:06;"It's July. Things are heating up."
00:06;00:13;"It's a great time to grab a brew, sit by the pool, and reflect."
00:13;00:21;"We'll be joined in the studio by Dave Longstreth to dig into some of the music that he and Jake made in the mid to late 90s."
00:21;00:26;"All that, plus the biggest concerts of all time."
00:27;00:33;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:38;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:43;00:50;"You were a fellow, I believe, all my rightful chances."
00:50;00:57;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:57;01:04;"And so I dealt to the floor, when a bus had to go."
01:05;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:15;01:19;"Leave it on me babe."
01:19;01:22;"Time Crisis back again."
01:22;01:25;"I'm chomping on some Pop Chips."
01:25;01:28;"Never fried, always real."
01:28;01:32;"We went on a whole thing about Pop Chips a few months ago."
01:33;01:35;"Made some barbecue ones, what do you think?"
01:35;01:38;"Not bad, I'm down. It's a clean chip."
01:38;01:41;"Wait, what's it made out of again? It's a little bit unnerving."
01:41;01:44;"It's a popped potato snack."
01:44;01:47;"It is made, it's potato rice flour sunflower oil."
01:47;01:49;"Yikes."
01:49;01:51;"That's a seed oil."
01:51;01:53;"What's the deal with seed oils?"
01:53;01:56;"I don't feel so good. They're bad for you."
01:56;01:58;"People say so on the internet."
01:58;02:00;"And your great grandmother definitely did not cook food with them."
02:01;02:03;"My grandmother definitely cooking with corn oil."
02:03;02:05;"Yeah, I don't know about sunflower oil."
02:05;02:09;"I thought sunflower seed oil was supposed to be like good."
02:09;02:11;"It's a high smoke point."
02:11;02:13;"That's what they tell you."
02:13;02:15;"Yeah."
02:15;02:16;"We'll save that for another episode."
02:16;02:18;"Anyway, this is a banked episode."
02:18;02:20;"It's the dog days of summer."
02:20;02:22;"We're back."
02:22;02:24;"We got Dave Longstreth in the studio."
02:24;02:26;"Welcome back, Dave."
02:26;02:28;"Good to be here."
02:28;02:30;"Thanks for coming down."
02:30;02:31;"In the next couple episodes,"
02:31;02:33;"I'm sure we'll talk about all sorts of stuff."
02:33;02:38;"We were kind of vaguely thinking that our July episodes"
02:38;02:44;"will be about some of the music that we were all part of in the early days."
02:44;02:47;"Our juvenalia, if you will."
02:47;02:49;"The early stuff."
02:49;02:52;"A lot of which I think people have never heard before."
02:52;02:55;"And for me, I'm not talking about early Vampire Weekend."
02:55;02:57;"I'm talking about before then."
02:58;03:00;"Going way back, even to childhood."
03:00;03:02;"And Jake and Dave, I know you guys have a lot of stuff too."
03:02;03:08;"I guess we could say this is our youth and young manhood episodes."
03:08;03:11;"Does anybody on the panel know what youth and young manhood is?"
03:11;03:14;"Not a single person in the room?"
03:14;03:16;"Is that a phrase that should resonate?"
03:16;03:18;"Youth and young manhood?"
03:18;03:20;"Nobody knows?"
03:20;03:22;"I've never heard that."
03:22;03:24;"Beyond what is obvious?"
03:25;03:27;"What do the words mean as a phrase?"
03:27;03:31;"Are you talking about the debut album from American rock band Kings of Leon?"
03:31;03:33;"Yep. That's after my time."
03:33;03:37;"A room full of rockers and nobody knows the name of KOL's debut album?"
03:37;03:39;"KOL."
03:39;03:41;"Dave, how many KOL songs can you name?"
03:41;03:43;"Um..."
03:43;03:45;"Sex on Fire."
03:45;03:47;"Jake, can you name one more?"
03:47;03:49;"I got nothing."
03:49;03:51;"After my time."
03:51;03:53;"Okay, how about, ""You know that I could use somebody."""
03:54;03:55;"Okay, use somebody."
03:55;03:57;"I don't know that song."
03:57;03:59;"Really? But you know Sex on Fire."
03:59;04:01;"I don't think so. How does it go?"
04:01;04:03;"It starts with an offbeat guitar thing."
04:03;04:07;"Well, the chorus goes, ""Yeah, your sex is on fire."""
04:07;04:09;"[imitates guitar]"
04:09;04:11;"Don't know it."
04:11;04:13;"Really?"
04:13;04:15;"Dead ass serious."
04:15;04:17;"I've heard of Kings of Leon."
04:17;04:19;"What are you guys talking about?"
04:19;04:21;"These were blockbuster smash hits."
04:21;04:23;"I tapped out on rock radio."
04:23;04:24;"It's a continuum."
04:24;04:26;"You guys don't know?"
04:26;04:28;"I don't know. I'm feeling this is a..."
04:28;04:30;"I think it's the resident Gen Xers."
04:30;04:32;"What year?"
04:32;04:34;"No, I think this is a Mandela effect thing."
04:34;04:36;"What year was Kings of Leon? Was this like '03?"
04:36;04:39;"In your memory, did Nelson Mandela die in prison?"
04:39;04:41;"Or as a free man?"
04:41;04:43;"Free man."
04:43;04:45;"He was released from prison after being in there for 26 years."
04:45;04:47;"And then what happened? He became?"
04:47;04:49;"The president."
04:49;04:51;"Of?"
04:51;04:52;"South Africa."
04:52;04:53;"[laughs]"
04:53;04:55;"Jake, 2008. Sex on fire."
04:55;04:58;"Oh, yeah, I'm tapped out, dude. 2008?"
04:58;05:00;"[guitar playing]"
05:00;05:02;"Sounds good so far."
05:02;05:04;"[laughs]"
05:04;05:07;"That was so genuine. Jake heard it once and said, ""Sounds pretty good."""
05:07;05:09;"I'm feeling it."
05:09;05:13;"They formed before 2008, though."
05:13;05:15;"Yeah?"
05:15;05:17;"Yeah, yeah."
05:17;05:19;"I feel 2004."
05:19;05:21;"Rock radio just got so bad."
05:21;05:22;"I just..."
05:22;05:27;"Not ringing a bell."
05:27;05:41;"Scott revival?"
05:41;05:43;"Yeah, it is a little Scott, but..."
05:43;05:48;"I mean, he's got real emotion in his voice. He's a good singer."
05:48;05:49;"[guitar playing]"
05:49;05:55;"Do you know anything about this band, Jake?"
05:55;05:57;"No."
05:57;06:00;"People call them the Southern Strokes, but they're really the Southern Oasis."
06:00;06:03;"'Cause they're brothers, known to scrap a bit."
06:03;06:05;"Mm-hmm."
06:05;06:11;"Doesn't ring a bell?"
06:11;06:13;"Never heard it."
06:13;06:17;"Sounds like a car commercial to me."
06:17;06:19;"Well, it was an influential song."
06:19;06:24;"That's where I think maybe our exposure to them might have been."
06:24;06:26;"[guitar playing]"
06:26;06:33;"You know, my taste is a little poppier."
06:33;06:38;"This is a little kind of heavy and despairing."
06:38;06:41;"Okay, wait. This is from their second album."
06:41;06:43;"This song's called ""The Bucket."""
06:43;06:45;"[guitar playing]"
06:46;06:47;"This song's stark."
06:47;06:50;"Yeah, the guitar tones are sick."
06:50;06:56;"[guitar playing]"
06:56;06:58;"I would say they're one of like that..."
06:58;07:00;"That's Stroke scene. Oh, man."
07:00;07:03;"Yeah. Also, Southern Strokes, people would say that derisively."
07:03;07:05;"That's a great concept."
07:05;07:07;"Yeah, that is a great..."
07:07;07:10;"If somebody gave me an elevator pitch, soft strokes, I'd say, ""How do I buy a share of that?"""
07:10;07:12;"[guitar playing]"
07:13;07:19;"Also, I don't know if I'm dissing myself, but I'd rather hear a guy from Tennessee singing like this"
07:19;07:23;"than like a dude in Brooklyn going, ""I'm honest."""
07:23;07:25;"Like, this guy's just being himself."
07:25;07:27;"[guitar playing]"
07:27;07:33;"I love the chorus of this song."
07:33;07:35;"[guitar playing]"
07:35;07:38;"[guitar playing]"
07:39;07:40;"[guitar playing]"
07:40;07:47;"18 balding star."
07:47;07:49;"[laughing]"
07:49;07:51;"[guitar playing]"
07:51;08:02;"So it's like, is this song about like..."
08:02;08:07;"Like a young dude in a rock band who blows up when he's 18?"
08:07;08:08;"And he's..."
08:08;08:10;"Balding?"
08:10;08:11;"Don't go and bald pretty early."
08:11;08:13;"[guitar playing]"
08:13;08:25;"It does sound pretty homemade in a cool way."
08:25;08:27;"Yeah, I like this. I like this one."
08:27;08:29;"[guitar playing]"
08:36;08:37;"Hear those blood harmonies?"
08:37;08:39;"Blood harmonies."
08:39;08:42;"Oh, you're about to hear some blood harmonies."
08:42;08:44;"We're gonna hear some blood harmonies."
08:44;08:48;"Anybody doesn't know blood harmonies is when siblings harmonize."
08:48;08:52;"And just that shared genetic material just makes the voices..."
08:52;08:54;"Sound so good together."
08:54;08:56;"Vibrate."
08:56;08:58;"[guitar playing]"
08:59;09:00;"[guitar playing]"
09:00;09:13;"[singing]"
09:14;09:15;"[singing]"
09:15;09:29;"Alright, anyway."
09:29;09:31;"Right on, little walk down the KOL lane."
09:31;09:34;"Also, one thing I always thought was cool about them..."
09:34;09:36;"Is I'm pretty sure..."
09:36;09:38;"I gotta double check this."
09:38;09:41;"I'm pretty sure all of their albums had five syllables."
09:42;09:44;"Album one, Youth and Young Manhood."
09:44;09:47;"Album two, Ah-Ha! Shake Heartbreak."
09:47;09:50;"Album three, Because of the Times."
09:50;09:53;"Album four, Only by the Night."
09:53;09:56;"Album five, Come Around Sundown."
09:56;09:59;"Album six, Mechanical Bull."
09:59;10:01;"Okay, then album seven..."
10:01;10:04;"Is this like a known thing or you just thought about this..."
10:04;10:06;"Like you were just kind of..."
10:06;10:08;"You know, whether this..."
10:08;10:10;"It's possible..."
10:11;10:14;"They were just doing a kind of beautiful mind analysis one day in a record store."
10:14;10:18;"It's also possible I read it in NME in 2009 or something."
10:18;10:20;"I guess they broke it with Walls."
10:20;10:22;"They were like, ""Enough already."""
10:22;10:25;"But I love that they kept that going for six albums."
10:25;10:28;"Wait, and then they came back with When You See Yourself."
10:28;10:30;"I wonder if things didn't go that well with Walls."
10:30;10:32;"[laughs]"
10:32;10:34;"That's crazy. Wait, they..."
10:34;10:36;"Yeah, that is wild."
10:36;10:39;"Sorry. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
10:40;10:41;"Eight albums, only one."
10:41;10:44;"I mean, I understand you got to break it up at some point."
10:44;10:46;"But I like that they came back to it."
10:46;10:48;"They did their Walls thing."
10:48;10:50;"I wonder how conscious that really is."
10:50;10:52;"Or maybe it's just like how..."
10:52;10:54;"It is like that flow."
10:54;10:56;"Here's an actual number crunch."
10:56;10:59;"What are the odds that seven out of eight albums would have five syllables"
10:59;11:04;"just randomly if you look at the average number of syllables in albums throughout history?"
11:04;11:06;"That's an easy one for you, dude."
11:06;11:08;"No, but it's not random."
11:09;11:13;"They probably have a certain kind of wordplay and flow that they like."
11:13;11:15;"You know that it comes from them."
11:15;11:17;"Is it conscious or unconscious, you mean?"
11:17;11:20;"Yeah. Are they literally sitting down and being like,"
11:20;11:23;"""Well, at some point after maybe the third album when they realized"
11:23;11:26;"that all of the albums had five syllables in the title,"
11:26;11:28;"they're like, 'We got to keep this going.'"""
11:28;11:31;"Or if they just like the way that youth and young manhood..."
11:31;11:33;"Someone's like, ""Let's call this album Riding a Mechanical Bull."""
11:33;11:35;"And they're like, ""One, two, three, four."""
11:35;11:37;"""No, no, no, no, no. We can just say Mechanical Bull."""
11:38;11:40;"That's five. Or is it just it rolls off the tongue?"
11:40;11:45;"Is it possible that WALLS is an acronym and that it's W-A-L-L-S?"
11:45;11:47;"Oh, it's five letters."
11:47;11:50;"Good call. Just putting it out there."
11:50;11:52;"Although W is technically more than one syllable."
11:52;11:56;"No, but maybe each letter stands for a..."
11:56;12:01;"What a long life, son."
12:01;12:04;"What a long... Damn, son."
12:04;12:07;"What a long life, son."
12:07;12:12;"Okay. I knew our guys wouldn't let us down with WALLS."
12:12;12:14;"It's like a callback to the first album."
12:14;12:16;"What is it? Young and..."
12:16;12:18;"Youth and Young Manhood."
12:18;12:20;"What a long life, son."
12:20;12:25;"WALLS, stylized as WALLS, is an acronym for We Are Like Love Song."
12:25;12:27;"Oh my God."
12:27;12:30;"Damn, son."
12:30;12:32;"Great number crunch, Nick."
12:32;12:35;"Wow. Seifold, you just pulled that out of the ether."
12:36;12:40;"I don't know. I got the probability calculator up and I'm out."
12:40;12:42;"I'm bailing. I don't understand any of this."
12:42;12:45;"You would need a lot of information to calculate that."
12:45;12:47;"But what does it stand for again?"
12:47;12:49;"We Are Like Love Songs."
12:49;12:52;"We Are Like Love Songs. The boys did it."
12:52;12:56;"These crazy bastards. I knew they wouldn't let it go."
12:56;13:00;"I'm dying to know if it's truly deliberate at this point. It's gotta be."
13:00;13:02;"I think it's gotta be."
13:02;13:04;"Seven in a row?"
13:05;13:06;"Yeah, I think it's seven in a row."
13:06;13:08;"I think it's seven in a row."
13:34;13:35;"I've always shown those guys to be there."
13:35;13:39;"I can't remember if I met everybody, but I just always thought they were extremely sweet."
13:39;13:41;"Very down to earth. Just like Oasis."
13:41;13:45;"That's right. You've hung with the Gallagher bros. At least one of them."
13:45;13:47;"I've hung with them each separately."
13:47;13:49;"Not in the same room."
13:49;13:51;"Definitely not in the same room."
13:51;13:53;"Hey, listen. Brothers fight, you know?"
13:53;13:55;"It's true."
13:55;13:58;"Do you guys ever beat the shit out of each other in your youth and young manhood?"
13:58;14:01;"Well, I'm five years older than Dave."
14:01;14:03;"So never full on."
14:03;14:04;"Like when you were 10, that would have just been."
14:04;14:06;"Yeah."
14:06;14:08;"Dave would rage."
14:08;14:10;"I would rage and Jake was always very gentle."
14:10;14:14;"He would sort of restrain me if I needed to be restrained."
14:14;14:22;"If I'm 12 and Dave's seven and he's like pissed and just like red in the face and is just like coming at me full steam,"
14:22;14:25;"you know, I could kind of like, I wasn't going to just like deck him."
14:25;14:30;"I can't. Yeah. I mean, I can't recall like a single time that you just like hit me."
14:30;14:32;"Yeah. If we were like two years."
14:32;14:34;"I can definitely recall trying to hit you."
14:34;14:36;"Oh, for sure. Yeah, definitely."
14:36;14:39;"I remember you slamming me in the head once with a metal Tonka truck."
14:39;14:41;"Wow."
14:41;14:47;"When I was like, when you were probably five and I was like 10 and we were like wrestling on the ground and I was on my back and you were like on top of me."
14:47;14:57;"She just like with both hands took this like, you know, metal toy with like a yellow Tonka truck that probably weighed like, I don't know, four or five pounds."
14:58;15:01;"And she just like, boom, like a cinder block in my head."
15:01;15:09;"And I was like, damn. And just like, you know, threw you off and was like, that's the only time I really remember just being like, yo, that, that got kind of burly."
15:09;15:12;"Yeah. Well, I could say at five, you wouldn't know the extent of."
15:12;15:15;"You say burly? Yeah. Burly. Burly situation."
15:15;15:17;"Burly is similar to buff."
15:17;15:20;"Yeah. It's a buff and burly, buff and burly."
15:21;15:28;"They claimed that the first three albums were coincidentally five syllables, but they surreptitiously kept it going."
15:28;15:35;"Uh huh. Okay. Okay. So yeah, you're right, Jay. Good. First it was, it just came from the first three albums just came from source."
15:35;15:38;"And then they were like, we, after that, let's keep this going."
15:38;15:40;"When was their last album?"
15:40;15:42;"2021. When you see yourself."
15:42;15:44;"So still a band."
15:44;15:47;"Yeah. Going strong. Cannot say the same for Oasis."
15:47;15:50;"Is there like a reunion in the mix? Is that?"
15:50;15:51;"For Oasis?"
15:51;15:53;"Yeah. Did I see that or did I not? I don't know."
15:53;16:05;"There's always, there's always somebody talking about it. And like, not, not that long ago, somebody sent me a video of Noel being very mean, but also very funny as the
Gallagher Brothers legend earlier."
16:05;16:12;"Cause somebody, there was some interview or something where the guy from the 1975, who were also from Manchester said like, you know, come on."
16:12;16:16;"You always have people saying this, like, come on guys, get over your and just like get to you."
16:17;16:23;"And then he just like, just went off on how terrible they were and how, when he saw them win the best rock award, he's like, are you kidding me?"
16:23;16:30;"I was watching them. I was just going to show my sons. And I thought maybe I'm just a grumpy old man. My son said, no, dad, you're right. It's ****. It's absolute."
16:30;16:38;"But he was like a smile on his face. But so he was basically on some, just like mind your **** business and your band sucks. So be careful."
16:38;16:42;"Even if you're a big Oasis fan, if you get a little too in their business, they will."
16:42;16:44;"Noel's going to slap back."
16:44;16:46;"Yeah. They're going to slap back."
16:46;16:47;"I'm going to slap back."
16:47;16:49;"I'm going to slap back."
17:15;17:16;"I'm going to slap back."
17:16;17:18;"I'm going to slap back."
17:44;17:47;"And so Sally can wait."
17:47;17:54;"She knows it's too late as we're walking on by."
17:54;18:00;"Her soul slides away."
18:00;18:03;"But don't look back in anger."
18:03;18:06;"I heard you say."
18:06;18:09;"Maybe we'll get a reunion at some point."
18:09;18:11;"It'd be kind of cool if they just never did."
18:11;18:13;"That would also be cool."
18:13;18:15;"I mean, clearly there's like actually bad blood."
18:15;18:17;"I think they're just such charming guys."
18:17;18:19;"It's hard to believe."
18:19;18:21;"When you see them get asked about in an interview,"
18:21;18:24;"they got this smile on their face and they have that classic northern wit."
18:24;18:26;"They'll say something funny."
18:26;18:28;"It's like you're never going to see like one of those guys like,"
18:28;18:30;"so you know, when you know that's your brother,"
18:30;18:32;"they're going to say, ""Oh, my mom still likes him."""
18:32;18:34;"You know, they're never going to be like,"
18:34;18:36;"they're never going to be like,"
18:36;18:41;"it's really triggering when you bring up my dysfunctional family."
18:42;18:44;"And how many times?"
18:44;18:46;"I've been in therapy about it for years."
18:46;18:49;"So there is that dissonance, but clearly there's something real."
18:49;18:52;"Did you not see, I'm trying to find it,"
18:52;18:55;"because it was a couple of weeks ago that Noel Gallagher"
18:55;18:59;"posted something on his Instagram."
18:59;19:01;"And then just right beneath it,"
19:01;19:05;"Liam just wrote, ""Why are you such a massive b****?"""
19:05;19:08;"Did you see this?"
19:08;19:09;"No."
19:09;19:11;"Oh, it's amazing."
19:11;19:12;"Noel's minding his business."
19:12;19:14;"And look here, what is it?"
19:14;19:16;"It says, ""Just subtweeting your brother."
19:16;19:18;"Last chance to ask Noel any..."""
19:18;19:20;"Oh, it was about like an AMA on Reddit."
19:20;19:24;"Noel posted an AMA on, he said, ""Hey, ask me anything."""
19:24;19:26;"And his brother's just like, ""You moron."
19:26;19:28;"Why are you such a moron?"""
19:28;19:30;"Love it. Wow."
19:30;19:32;"And then he started getting into fights with other fans."
19:32;19:34;"Just nothing to do, hanging out on Reddit,"
19:34;19:37;"like 11 in the morning on a Wednesday."
19:37;19:39;"That seems pretty good nature."
19:40;19:41;"Here's the thing."
19:41;19:43;"They're so funny."
19:43;19:45;"You feel like there's always this reunion around the corner."
19:45;19:47;"It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we play it up a bit for,"
19:47;19:49;"you know, for the press."
19:49;19:51;"But, you know, actually, we've been rehearsing."
19:51;19:53;"Actually, we got a pint last week."
19:53;19:55;"But I don't think it's true."
19:55;19:57;"I think there really is, they're just charming, funny guys,"
19:57;19:59;"but there's real bad blood."
19:59;20:01;"You know what I'd say? I'd say it's up to them."
20:01;20:04;"Do you know the producers that have Broadway play?"
20:04;20:06;"Oh, the Mel Brooks."
20:06;20:08;"The premise that they could make more money"
20:09;20:10;"through, like, failure than..."
20:10;20:12;"Is that what's maybe happening with Oasis,"
20:12;20:14;"where they crunch the numbers and they're like,"
20:14;20:16;"""I'm not gonna do the accent,"""
20:16;20:18;"but they could be like, ""We could make more money,"
20:18;20:20;"actually, like, not together."""
20:20;20:22;"Do you know what I mean?"
20:22;20:24;"I like where you're at, but I don't think that's true."
20:24;20:26;"I just don't think it's true."
20:26;20:28;"Although, actually, it might be."
20:28;20:30;"Well, you know what? It's funny."
20:30;20:32;"I say that, and then I remember"
20:32;20:34;"that when I worked on that song for a couple days"
20:34;20:36;"for Liam's album,"
20:37;20:39;"I was in the mix with his band and stuff."
20:39;20:41;"They were talking about how they're trying to finish"
20:41;20:43;"the record by a certain time"
20:43;20:45;"because he had these massive gigs."
20:45;20:47;"And he was playing..."
20:47;20:49;"He sold out to Nebworth's,"
20:49;20:52;"which is famously where Oasis kind of, like,"
20:52;20:55;"when they ascended to the biggest band in the world,"
20:55;20:57;"in England, they played some place where maybe"
20:57;21:01;"they sold 100,000 tickets in an hour,"
21:01;21:03;"you know, some nutty thing like that."
21:03;21:06;"Anyway, Liam did it by himself."
21:06;21:08;"Maybe he even did two nights or something."
21:08;21:10;"So actually..."
21:10;21:11;"Was he playing Oasis songs?"
21:11;21:13;"I think he's playing Oasis songs."
21:13;21:15;"Actually, Seinfeld, can we get a number crunch"
21:15;21:19;"on Liam Gallagher's Nebworth set list"
21:19;21:21;"whenever he played the last couple of years?"
21:21;21:23;"Yeah, so if anybody's imagining"
21:23;21:25;"anybody who I think would have to be outside the UK"
21:25;21:27;"to realize, you know,"
21:27;21:29;"they were, like, the biggest thing on Earth."
21:29;21:31;"Yeah."
21:31;21:33;"And I don't think there's even, like, an American equivalent."
21:33;21:35;"So if anybody's picturing, like, well, with Oasis,"
21:35;21:36;"they were massive."
21:36;21:38;"You know, Liam, he's doing, he's doing,"
21:38;21:41;"you could do 1,500 Newcastle."
21:41;21:43;"It's not Oasis numbers, but that's not true either."
21:43;21:45;"Right."
21:45;21:47;"Okay, we got Liam Gallagher's set list"
21:47;21:50;"at Nebworth, June 3rd, 2022."
21:50;21:53;"Yeah, he opens with three Oasis songs,"
21:53;21:55;"""Hello, Rock and Roll Star,"" ""Morning Glory."""
21:55;21:58;"Then he starts getting into some solo material,"
21:58;22:00;"""Wall of Glass,"" about four songs."
22:00;22:03;"People had to get their second pint of the evening."
22:04;22:05;"Yep."
22:05;22:07;"Around the fourth song."
22:07;22:09;"Well, who knows?"
22:09;22:11;"No, Trueheads are up front."
22:11;22:13;"The Trueheads are like, oh, they're like, oh, hell yeah."
22:13;22:15;"Then he did another three Oasis."
22:15;22:17;"Which ones?"
22:17;22:19;"""Stand By Me,"" ""Roll It Over,"" ""Slide Away."""
22:19;22:21;"Okay."
22:21;22:23;"I mean, he still hasn't done any of, like, the global hits."
22:23;22:25;"Right."
22:25;22:26;"But I think even, even, like, an Oasis album track."
22:26;22:28;"Sure."
22:28;22:30;"Is over there."
22:30;22:32;"And then they did five more originals."
22:33;22:34;"""6060,"" ""40."""
22:34;22:36;"And then, are they doing, like, ""Don't Look Back in Anger,"""
22:36;22:38;"like, for the encore, or?"
22:38;22:40;"Interestingly, he didn't play ""Don't Look Back in Anger,"" but..."
22:40;22:42;"Well, Noel sings that one."
22:42;22:44;"Ah, there you go."
22:44;22:46;"That'd be pretty cheeky if he sang it."
22:46;22:48;"Too much respect for the material and his brother."
22:48;22:50;"That's right."
22:50;22:52;"He could just do it."
22:52;22:54;"No, then the encore is all Oasis."
22:54;22:56;"Some might say ""Cigarettes and Alcohol,"" ""Supersonic,"""
22:56;22:58;"""Wonderwall,"" ""Live Forever,"""
22:58;23:00;"""Encore 2,"" ""Champagne Supernova."""
23:00;23:02;"Wow."
23:02;23:03;"And it's all coming out very strong."
23:03;23:04;"How many special people change?"
23:04;23:06;"How many lives are living strange?"
23:06;23:08;"Where were you while we were getting high?"
23:08;23:10;"Slowly walking down the hall"
23:10;23:12;"Faster than a cannonball"
23:12;23:14;"Where were you while we were getting high?"
23:14;23:16;"Someday you will find me"
23:16;23:18;"Caught beneath the last of the sea"
23:18;23:20;"And I'll be gone before you know it"
23:20;23:22;"I'm not gonna wait for you"
23:32;23:33;"I'm not gonna wait for you"
23:33;23:35;"I'm not gonna wait for you"
24:01;24:02;"I'm not gonna wait for you"
24:02;24:04;"I'm not gonna wait for you"
24:31;24:34;"Someday you will find me"
24:34;24:38;"Carved beneath the last slide"
24:38;24:41;"In a champagne, safe and open"
24:41;24:43;"In the sky"
24:43;24:46;"Someday you will find me"
24:46;24:50;"Carved beneath the last slide"
24:50;24:54;"In a champagne, safe and open"
24:54;24:57;"A champagne, safe and open"
24:58;25:00;"'Cause people believe"
25:00;25:06;"That the color can't wait for the sun"
25:06;25:14;"'Cause you and I are living down here"
25:14;25:16;"The world's still spinning around"
25:16;25:19;"We're talking about why"
25:19;25:25;"Why, why, why, why"
25:26;25:30;"So, um, he did 12 Oasis songs and 10 originals."
25:30;25:35;"So, I mean, if you're a fan, it's like, you're not gonna get ""Don't Look Back in Anger."""
25:35;25:40;"But the rest of it, if you're, especially if you're, you know, a couple hundred yards back,"
25:40;25:45;"knowing that Noel is up there playing rhythm guitar might mean a lot to you."
25:45;25:49;"Or it could just be like, ""This sounds like a Liam solo gig to me."""
25:49;25:52;"You know, I mean, he's singing the songs."
25:52;25:55;"It's not like there's like those classic Oasis harmonies."
25:55;25:57;"There's not that blood harmony."
25:57;25:59;"I mean, sometimes."
25:59;26:05;"A little bit, but like, I'm just saying, if you're like halfway, you know, up the like upper deck at like Wembley."
26:05;26:11;"I guess another way to look at it, though, is if Liam is this big as a solo gig,"
26:11;26:16;"does that mean that, you know, like, sometimes when you read about these concerts from the 80s,"
26:16;26:21;"the ones that come to mind, it's always like, and just for anybody who's not a music industry professional,"
26:22;26:28;"you probably know this, like an arena show, if it's like the classic half full arena, it's like 12,000 people."
26:28;26:32;"If you do the full arena, 360, that's maybe 20,000."
26:32;26:36;"An arena like Taylor Swift plays, she might be selling 80,000 tickets."
26:36;26:41;"And then, you know, like, let me try to think, like a classic venue in New York, like Webster Hall."
26:41;26:44;"Who wouldn't be psyched to sell out Webster Hall?"
26:44;26:47;"But that's 1,200 people, you know, just to give some..."
26:48;26:52;"So anyway, Liam Gallagher, he's doing Taylor Swift plus numbers."
26:52;26:57;"And then every once in a while, you know, on some like weird post on social media,"
26:57;27:04;"you see something about like, when Metallica went to Moscow in 1988, they played to 1.2 million people."
27:04;27:08;"So that, you know, there's like big, big superstar stadium shows."
27:08;27:11;"And then there's this level above that are like the biggest shows of all time."
27:11;27:15;"You always see this, you read about something in Brazil, where it's a million people."
27:15;27:17;"Or Mark Brook, Central Park."
27:17;27:19;"That's not a million. That's maybe a hundred."
27:19;27:22;"No, no, that was like 700,000 or something."
27:22;27:24;"What does that even mean?"
27:24;27:25;"I don't know."
27:25;27:27;"They're counting people in restaurants on Fifth Avenue."
27:27;27:30;"I just remember that Garth Brooks Netflix doc."
27:30;27:32;"Oh, yeah?"
27:32;27:35;"When he was just like tearing up and like weeping in front of the camera for half of it."
27:35;27:38;"They went deep on the 1997, I think that was..."
27:38;27:41;"Central Park. OK, Number Crunch. How many tickets?"
27:41;27:43;"Maybe it was a free show too."
27:43;27:45;"Oh, I'm sure. Yeah, I don't think it was ticketed."
27:46;27:49;"Think about any time if you've ever been to a stadium show or even a festival,"
27:49;27:55;"like a big, big festival like Glastonbury, the whole thing is maybe 200,000 people."
27:55;27:58;"And that you already feel like you're in a city."
27:58;28:00;"Yeah."
28:00;28:04;"You know, so whenever I read about a concert that drew one million people,"
28:04;28:06;"at a certain point, like what are you talking?"
28:06;28:10;"I think you are starting to just count people in restaurants and apartment buildings."
28:10;28:12;"Like, what does that mean?"
28:12;28:14;"Yeah, I don't know how a million people watch Metallica."
28:15;28:18;"Anyway, I think of this because maybe Oasis could play to a million people."
28:18;28:19;"Where would they do it?"
28:19;28:21;"Moscow."
28:21;28:22;"Yeah, Moscow."
28:22;28:26;"No, but like, yeah, but like their popularity drops pretty significantly outside the UK."
28:26;28:29;"And what's the population of the UK? 60 million or something?"
28:29;28:32;"Yeah, 60, 70, 80, 60 to 80."
28:32;28:34;"So you need to be..."
28:34;28:35;"65."
28:35;28:38;"To play to a million people, you need one out of 60 people to go to your show?"
28:38;28:43;"I think Oasis could go to Germany and pull some big numbers and maybe Japan."
28:44;28:48;"Oasis in LA, where do you think they'd play? Hollywood Bowl or bigger? Dodger Stadium?"
28:48;28:52;"Oh, I mean, at this point, with all the people excited to see them,"
28:52;28:56;"Oasis could do many nights at the Hollywood Bowl."
28:56;28:57;"I think Oasis could..."
28:57;28:58;"Forum?"
28:58;29:01;"If I'm Oasis booking agent, I'm saying, you know what, boys?"
29:01;29:03;"Let's go big. Let's do Dodger Stadium."
29:03;29:05;"And you know what? Let's even put a hold on night two."
29:05;29:06;"See how it does."
29:06;29:08;"You're talking Oasis reunion?"
29:08;29:09;"Yeah, yeah."
29:09;29:10;"Oh, yeah, this is Oasis reunion."
29:10;29:11;"This is like Dodger Stadium for sure."
29:11;29:14;"Hypothetical 2025 Oasis tour."
29:14;29:15;"They come to LA."
29:15;29:19;"Well, just for instance, the Cure just sold out three nights at Hollywood Bowl."
29:19;29:21;"How much is that? $14,000?"
29:21;29:23;"Hollywood Bowl is $18,000 if you sell it out."
29:23;29:26;"So times three, that's $54,000."
29:26;29:27;"They could have done Dodger Stadium."
29:27;29:29;"Well, that's debatable because..."
29:29;29:30;"Fifty?"
29:30;29:32;"The Cure might have played Dodger Stadium."
29:32;29:37;"It's $56,000. So can they do SoFi Stadium, which is $70,000?"
29:37;29:38;"I don't like that for my guys."
29:40;29:42;"I'm going to pause."
29:42;29:45;"I'm going to talk to the boys."
29:45;29:46;"You're talking big."
29:46;29:49;"I'm going to try to get a nice offer for Dodger Stadium."
29:49;29:52;"You know what? If we blow that out, maybe we come back for SoFi in a couple of years."
29:52;29:57;"But SoFi, Oasis and SoFi, I'm getting a tiny bit nervous."
29:57;30:00;"Maybe. I don't think it's impossible, though."
30:00;30:01;"I don't think it's impossible."
30:01;30:06;"God, Oasis and Dodger Stadium seems like a stretch to me, but talking it through,"
30:06;30:07;"I mean, they could do three nights at the Bowl."
30:07;30:09;"So that's the same thing. So, okay."
30:09;30:13;"And I do also feel like LA, we've talked about LA is not jam country,"
30:13;30:16;"although Phish blew out three nights at the Bowl."
30:16;30:20;"LA is not jam country, but LA has always had a connection to British music."
30:20;30:23;"You know, everybody is famously the Morrissey thing."
30:23;30:26;"But also Depeche Mode, that's an LA band."
30:26;30:27;"Sure."
30:27;30:28;"You know what I mean? They're from England."
30:28;30:32;"Depeche Mode, beloved in LA. They always come through, do big shows."
30:32;30:36;"The Cure. I felt like even... I really should have gone."
30:36;30:39;"That's around the time I had laryngitis, didn't feel like going."
30:39;30:41;"I wouldn't have been able to sing along."
30:41;30:45;"But I even felt like when those three shows, the Cure shows were happening,"
30:45;30:47;"I just felt like I really knew about it."
30:47;30:48;"Yeah."
30:48;30:50;"You know, there's bands that come to town, they could do five nights."
30:50;30:52;"Nobody I know would mention it."
30:52;30:55;"But I really knew a lot of people going and a lot of conversation."
30:55;30:59;"And there's even somebody invited us to go, and I said, ""Rishi, do you want to go to..."""
30:59;31:03;"I don't think she'd be embarrassed by that. She's a R&B person."
31:03;31:04;"That's well documented on the show."
31:04;31:06;"Well documented, Gen X, R&B person."
31:06;31:07;"Not a rock fan."
31:07;31:09;"I said, ""Would you want to see The Cure at Hollywood Bowl?"""
31:09;31:12;"And she was like, ""Oh, I'm embarrassed. Wait, who exactly are The Cure?"""
31:12;31:14;"And then I started playing songs."
31:14;31:15;"Friday, I'm in love."
31:15;31:17;"Yeah, but when I played..."
31:17;31:23;"She was like, ""Oh my God. Oh, of course, of course."""
31:23;31:26;"And she was like, ""Oh, right, right. Oh man, this takes me back to my childhood."""
31:26;31:27;"Dude, this was on the radio."
31:27;31:31;"So even just her growing up in LA, that was a big hit."
31:31;31:34;"She was like, ""Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh right, of course, The Cure."""
31:34;31:38;"Maybe it's something to do with this gloomy British outlook of those bands we repre..."
31:38;31:40;"Smiths, Cure, Depeche Mode."
31:40;31:49;"And then that's somehow the opposite, and it resonates with the sunny, bleached out LA warmth or something."
31:49;31:50;"I think there's some..."
31:50;31:51;"Tropical goth, it's a thing."
31:51;31:53;"Tropical goth. SoCal goth."
31:53;31:58;"It's like we've discussed Latin America, goth country."
31:58;31:59;"Big time."
31:59;32:01;"Emo, goth."
32:01;32:06;"Yeah, you could also imagine, you're growing up in Bogota or something."
32:06;32:08;"Kind of hot a lot of the time."
32:08;32:11;"Throw on Smiths, you hear Morrissey."
32:11;32:14;"A dreaded sunny day, so I'll meet you at the cemetery gates."
32:14;32:16;"I can feel you really connect with them."
32:16;32:18;"It cools you right down."
32:18;32:19;"That's right."
32:19;32:23;"Whenever I'm alone with you"
32:26;32:30;"You make me feel like I am whole again"
32:30;32:36;"Whenever I'm alone with you"
32:36;32:44;"You make me feel like I am whole again"
32:45;32:59;"(instrumental)"
32:59;33:03;"Whenever I'm alone with you"
33:03;33:11;"You make me feel like I am young again"
33:13;33:17;"Whenever I'm alone with you"
33:17;33:25;"You make me feel like I am father again"
33:25;33:30;"However far away"
33:30;33:34;"I will always love you"
33:34;33:37;"However far I stay"
33:37;33:41;"I will always love you"
33:41;33:44;"Whatever words I say"
33:44;33:48;"I will always love you"
33:48;33:51;"I will always love you"
33:51;33:55;"But anyways, how many people saw Garth Brooks in Central Park?"
33:55;33:57;"Let me just do a number crunch on that."
33:57;34:01;"I did want to tell you that the Rolling Stones played Dodger Stadium in 1997."
34:01;34:02;"And blew it out, I bet."
34:02;34:04;"Well, yeah, and they played SoFi recently."
34:04;34:07;"That's because my guys have been out there working it on the road."
34:07;34:09;"Keeping the legend alive."
34:09;34:10;"90,000 people."
34:10;34:12;"Oh, wait. So I added a zero. My bad."
34:12;34:14;"You said 9,000 or 9?"
34:14;34:15;"I said 900."
34:15;34:18;"And then Garth Brooks has also played Yankee Stadium."
34:18;34:22;"I'm sure it also must feel pretty good, especially back then, to be a country artist."
34:22;34:24;"And come through and blow it out in New York City."
34:24;34:27;"According to his Wikipedia, it's a million."
34:27;34:28;"It's a million."
34:28;34:29;"Oh, okay. It is a million."
34:29;34:30;"Wait, I apologize."
34:30;34:33;"The Garth Brooks show in Central Park in '97 was a million."
34:33;34:34;"Right?"
34:34;34:36;"Where in Central Park is it? How are there a million people there?"
34:36;34:39;"The biggest place you can do a show is the Great Lawn."
34:39;34:41;"That's where the famous Simon and Garth Bunkle show is."
34:41;34:44;"I just remember watching that doc and being like, ""What are they saying?"""
34:44;34:45;"There are a million people."
34:45;34:46;"What are they saying?"
34:46;34:47;"I was like, ""What?"""
34:47;34:50;"Isn't the whole population of the city 10 million or something?"
34:50;34:52;"14 million?"
34:52;34:56;"You would have a Garth Brooks plate for 10 million people in Manhattan."
34:56;35:00;"One out of 10 people in the entire city is at the Garth Brooks show?"
35:00;35:01;"Unbelievable."
35:01;35:05;"Citizen, exit your building immediately."
35:05;35:08;"And make your way to Central Park for the Garth Brooks show."
35:08;35:12;"The population of New York is like 8. something million."
35:12;35:15;"A couple people come in from Jersey and Connecticut, you got yourself 10 million."
35:15;35:19;"One member of every household must attend."
35:19;35:21;"You will be scanned upon entry."
35:21;35:25;"When you really think about the logistics, too, of a million-plus show,"
35:25;35:28;"and especially it is funny to think if you want to get into record-breaking,"
35:28;35:32;"10 million, you'd have to find basically the flattest place in the world."
35:32;35:34;"You'd have to go to the Great Plains."
35:34;35:35;"Yeah."
35:35;35:38;"And you would have to have a military operation."
35:38;35:40;"Like Salt Flats in Utah."
35:40;35:41;"Yeah."
35:41;35:42;"10 million people."
35:42;35:44;"I mean, it's terrifying when you think--"
35:44;35:48;"I actually get chills thinking about it, a 10 million-person concert."
35:48;35:49;"It's horrible."
35:49;35:51;"I have a great idea."
35:51;35:56;"An EDM festival in August on the Great Salt Flats in Utah."
35:56;35:57;"10 million people."
35:58;35:59;"Let's get them there."
35:59;36:00;"It's nonstop."
36:00;36:07;"Like every mile, there's a new giant screen and speakers."
36:07;36:08;"It also sounds so insane."
36:08;36:09;"It's a weird delay."
36:09;36:10;"[MIMICS DISTORTED SOUND]"
36:10;36:11;"Totally."
36:11;36:12;"Well, you could use headphones."
36:12;36:13;"It could be all Bluetooth."
36:13;36:15;"Oh, yeah, like a silent disco?"
36:15;36:16;"Yeah, like a silent disco."
36:16;36:21;"I want to tell you the estimation of the number of attendees is wildly inconsistent."
36:21;36:22;"I'm sure."
36:22;36:27;"Multiple sources going anywhere from 300,000 to 450,000 to 980,000."
36:27;36:32;"And there are articles that are like, depending on who you talk to, is either 300,000 or a million."
36:32;36:34;"So I just want to call out--"
36:34;36:37;"There's definitely some Garth Brooks truthers out there."
36:37;36:38;"That's what I'm saying."
36:38;36:39;"Garth did not do a million."
36:39;36:42;"[LAUGHTER]"
36:42;36:50;"OK, so I think we've got to find the flattest part of England, and we're doing a 10 million-person Oasis reunion, the biggest concert of all time."
36:50;36:51;"I like that for my guys."
36:51;36:52;"I love that for my guys."
36:52;36:53;"10 million people don't show up."
36:53;36:54;"They won't play."
36:54;36:56;"Like, there should be an ultimatum."
36:56;36:57;"True."
36:57;36:58;"Baked in."
36:58;36:59;"Oh, that would be sick, too."
36:59;37:02;"And actually, let's make the tickets reasonable."
37:02;37:04;"Let's say tickets are--"
37:04;37:05;"$1."
37:05;37:06;"20 quid."
37:06;37:08;"How about 20 quid?"
37:08;37:10;"That's 200 million quid."
37:10;37:11;"I'll take a modest 5%--"
37:11;37:12;"That's $25."
37:12;37:14;"--for my troubles."
37:14;37:16;"$25 US."
37:16;37:17;"OK."
37:17;37:21;"You get people coming from all over the-- I mean, that would also be sick, too, just like,"
37:21;37:25;"I know you could not stomach each other for a year-long world tour."
37:25;37:28;"I know you're never going to come to LA and play Dodger Stadium."
37:28;37:34;"All I'm asking for is you put aside your differences for one night, and we're going to do the biggest"
37:34;37:36;"concert of all time."
37:36;37:37;"10 million people."
37:37;37:39;"The tickets are reasonable."
37:39;37:40;"20 quid."
37:40;37:44;"You're going to get multi-generational families rolling together."
37:44;37:48;"You're going to gross 200 million quid in one night."
37:48;37:52;"Plus, we're going to sell the TV rights to certain territories."
37:52;37:53;"I don't know."
37:53;37:56;"At the end of the day, we're making 400 million quid."
37:56;37:57;"What do you say, boys?"
37:57;37:59;"If only 10% of those people buy t-shirts."
37:59;38:00;"Oh, yeah."
38:00;38:01;"Forget-- oh."
38:01;38:02;"I was there."
38:02;38:03;"Concessions?"
38:03;38:05;"You getting a cut of that?"
38:05;38:06;"10 million people."
38:06;38:08;"So that's a lot of beer being sold."
38:08;38:14;"Do you think that the brothers have been pitched this idea or variations of this idea?"
38:14;38:17;"Yeah, I'm sure they've gotten an offer to headline Coachella or something like that."
38:17;38:18;"Yeah."
38:18;38:23;"I'm sure they've had the big companies come and offer them $100 million tours."
38:23;38:27;"Of course, because remember back in the day when Live Nation started, you'd hear, ""Oh,"
38:27;38:28;"you two got $300 million."
38:28;38:29;"Madonna got this."""
38:29;38:33;"In some ways, it's like they're getting a check from a bank that they have to then pay"
38:33;38:34;"off for years."
38:34;38:39;"But I'm sure somebody came and said, ""Oasis, if you guys will tour on and off for the next"
38:39;38:44;"four years, we will give you, I don't know, $100 million each right now."""
38:44;38:45;"Maybe."
38:45;38:46;"That could happen."
38:46;38:48;"Maybe Noel being like, ""I'm already rich."""
38:48;38:49;"Yeah, exactly."
38:49;38:50;"Yeah."
38:50;38:53;"Okay, but if they sold that out, that's 200 million quid."
38:53;38:56;"That's $250 million."
38:56;38:57;"Yeah."
38:57;38:59;"A quarter of a billion in one night."
38:59;39:00;"If that was a success."
39:00;39:01;"That's bad for a day's work."
39:01;39:02;"Right?"
39:02;39:03;"Yeah."
39:03;39:04;"Now, I think that's how we get them."
39:04;39:05;"""Hey, this is a moonshot."
39:05;39:06;"This is a Theranos."
39:06;39:08;"I don't know if this could work."""
39:08;39:10;"We're going to need to evacuate Manhattan."
39:10;39:12;"""Where's the Great Steps?"
39:12;39:13;"The Great Step?"
39:13;39:15;"That's in the hinterlands."
39:15;39:16;"The Great Step."""
39:16;39:17;"Oh, the Great Step of Mongolia?"
39:17;39:18;"Yeah."
39:18;39:19;"Mongolia."
39:19;39:20;"Oh my gosh."
39:20;39:21;"The Eurasian Step?"
39:21;39:22;"Because I don't know if this is possible."
39:22;39:26;"It's going to gross $250 million, but it's going to cost $400 million to put it on."
39:26;39:27;"Yeah."
39:27;39:28;"We're going to lose."
39:28;39:29;"Maybe the guys will be into it."
39:29;39:30;"Maybe it's not about the money."
39:30;39:33;"It's just about being the biggest concert ever."
39:33;39:35;"It's about being a legend, mate."
39:35;39:40;"It's about somehow figuring out how to get 10 million people in one place."
39:40;39:42;"There might not even be a place in England you could do it."
39:42;39:44;"Also, you're calling it Oasis."
39:44;39:48;"We are building the infrastructure for essentially the future city."
39:48;39:53;"So you play one night, and for the, I don't know, forever."
39:53;39:55;"Under a dome, so it doesn't, right?"
39:55;39:57;"We're not dealing with environmental issues."
39:57;39:59;"I don't know if you can make a dome for 10 million people."
39:59;40:00;"Not yet."
40:00;40:01;"Not with that attitude."
40:01;40:07;"Look, to find room to make a 10 million person concert, it's going to get weird."
40:07;40:09;"The UN is going to investigate it."
40:09;40:11;"People will probably be forcibly removed."
40:11;40:17;"You know, with the new Apple Vision Pro, that dream could become a real reality if you did it with Bluetooth."
40:17;40:19;"Hmm."
40:19;40:20;"Not the same?"
40:20;40:21;"Let me talk to the guys."
40:21;40:23;"I don't like that for the guys."
40:23;40:26;"I just don't know if that's going to get them excited."
40:26;40:28;"I'm sure they've been pitched that, too."
40:28;40:31;"Can you imagine Noel riffing on AI?"
40:31;40:33;"Oasis is going to be virtual reality."
40:33;40:34;"We got an idea."
40:34;40:37;"You're going to be playing in Roblox."
40:37;40:40;"You're going to have an Oasis concert."
40:40;40:42;"Do you know what Fortnite is?"
40:42;40:45;"You're going to be playing in Fortnite."
40:45;40:51;"No joke, I could totally picture, especially during COVID, somebody goes to the guys and is like,"
40:51;40:54;"""Boys, I know you can't stand being in the same room together."
40:54;41:05;"What if I told you, one night only, you could be across the world from each other, but you plug in and you do a Fortnite concert, 4 million quid each."
41:05;41:07;"What do you say, boys?"""
41:07;41:09;"I think the answer is still no."
41:09;41:11;"It has to be more than just the money."
41:11;41:14;"I think it has to be a record-setting, legendary thing."
41:14;41:20;"We'll have to get some sort of civic engineer to let us know if there's anywhere on Earth you could have 10 million people see a concert."
41:20;41:25;"Actually, before we drop this, can we just get a list of the biggest concerts of all time?"
41:25;41:28;"How many is Nebworth? What's the capacity there?"
41:28;41:31;"I think it's like 80,000 each night."
41:31;41:38;"I vaguely remember something about a Zeppelin show at Nebworth in '79 or something."
41:38;41:43;"That was maybe the biggest show of that era."
41:43;41:44;"Where is Nebworth?"
41:44;41:46;"I think it's up by Manchester."
41:46;41:52;"Liam did two shows last year and he sold 160,000 tickets."
41:52;41:53;"Wow."
41:53;41:57;"Okay, so supposedly, these are the biggest concerts of all time."
41:57;42:07;"For ticketed concerts, the biggest ticketed concert of all time was Indio Solari in Olavarilla, Argentina."
42:07;42:12;"Supposedly, Indio Solari sold 500,000 tickets."
42:12;42:18;"In 1990, Roger Waters played a concert at the Berlin Wall."
42:18;42:22;"Actually, I know that concert. I've listened to it because he brought out Van Morrison to sing ""Comfortably Numb."""
42:22;42:25;"It's pretty tight. This one they used in ""The Departed."""
42:25;42:29;"So supposedly, that concert, he did 350,000 tickets."
42:29;42:31;"I hope they were cheap."
42:31;42:32;"Yeah, come on."
42:32;42:37;"You're celebrating this historic event in geopolitics."
42:37;42:40;"Yeah, I feel like a lot of these big concerts are going to be in politics."
42:40;42:44;"Somebody's coming out of East Germany and they're just like..."
42:44;42:45;"I have no money, dude."
42:45;42:46;"Yeah, you got to come see this."
42:46;42:52;"Hello, is there anybody in there?"
42:52;42:56;"Just God, if you can hear me."
42:56;43:01;"Is there anyone at home?"
43:01;43:04;"Come on, come on down."
43:04;43:08;"I hear you're feeling down."
43:08;43:15;"Well, I can ease your pain and get you on your feet again."
43:15;43:22;"Relax, I need some information."
43:22;43:26;"Just the basic facts."
43:26;43:31;"Can you show me where it hurts?"
43:31;43:36;"There is no pain you are receiving."
43:36;43:46;"But this tension smoke on the horizon."
43:46;43:52;"You are only coming through getting laid."
43:52;43:59;"You're desperate but I can't hear what you're saying."
43:59;44:07;"When I was a child I had a fever."
44:07;44:14;"My hands went just like two balloons."
44:14;44:21;"Now I've got that feeling once again."
44:21;44:26;"I can explain but you would not understand."
44:26;44:33;"Well, this is not how I am."
44:33;44:41;"I have become comfortably numb."
44:41;44:44;"If I go through the list of..."
44:44;44:47;"Yeah, then you see some Paul McCartney shows."
44:47;44:50;"A lot of these shows are in Rio de Janeiro."
44:50;44:55;"Frank Sinatra, 1980 played to 175,000 people in Rio."
44:55;44:58;"Let's go to free concerts."
44:58;45:00;"This is where you get psycho."
45:00;45:02;"It was $20 a ticket."
45:02;45:03;"It was?"
45:03;45:05;"At the Roger Waters show."
45:05;45:07;"Come on, why didn't you just make it free, bro?"
45:07;45:10;"It soon became free because people just started flooding in."
45:10;45:13;"This is so bizarre."
45:13;45:16;"Supposedly, the biggest concert of all time,"
45:16;45:18;"and this is a free concert,"
45:18;45:20;"was Jean-Michel Jarre."
45:20;45:21;"You guys know who he is?"
45:21;45:22;"No."
45:23;45:24;"JMJ."
45:24;45:27;"He's kind of like a French synth legend."
45:27;45:30;"I'd always find his records from the '70s."
45:30;45:33;"He's been sampled a bunch."
45:33;45:39;"He maybe shares something in common with Vangelis."
45:39;45:40;"Okay."
45:40;45:43;"He's kind of like a Prague synth guy from the '70s."
45:43;45:47;"His famous album is called Oxygen."
45:47;45:54;"But supposedly, he played in Moscow, September 6, 1997,"
45:54;45:58;"for the 850th anniversary of Moscow,"
45:58;46:06;"and over 3.5 million people were there."
46:06;46:10;"Just jamming to this."
46:10;46:13;"3.5 million people in Moscow just going nuts for this?"
46:13;46:15;"In '97?"
46:15;46:17;"You guys probably have heard this before."
46:17;46:19;"It's not ringing a bell."
46:19;46:31;"God, this is weird."
46:31;46:34;"So, attendance numbers for many of the kinds of events listed here"
46:34;46:36;"rely on estimations from the premieres."
46:36;46:37;"Dave, get on that mic if you're going to."
46:37;46:39;"And are known to be exaggerations."
46:39;46:40;"Yes, it could be exaggerated."
46:40;46:45;"Also, they claim Rod Stewart played for 3.5 million people in Rio de Janeiro."
46:45;46:49;"Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face."
46:49;46:51;"New Year's Eve of '94."
46:51;46:52;"3 million people."
46:52;46:55;"So, do you think all the top four are all from the '90s"
46:55;46:59;"because after the '90s, the numbers got more accurate?"
46:59;47:01;"Ooh, that's a good point."
47:01;47:03;"Yeah, because actually, Jean-Michel Jarre claims to have"
47:03;47:06;"three of the top ten biggest shows ever."
47:06;47:08;"Something about that's not adding up for me."
47:08;47:10;"Including in Houston in '86."
47:10;47:15;"He played a concert in 1986 called Rendezvous Houston, a city in concert."
47:15;47:19;"It's a live performance by Jean-Michel Jarre amidst the skyscrapers of downtown Houston."
47:19;47:22;"Looks like they projected stuff onto the skyscrapers."
47:22;47:24;"He's claiming 1.3 million people came."
47:24;47:25;"I'm not buying this."
47:25;47:27;"1.3 million people in downtown Houston?"
47:27;47:28;"No."
47:28;47:29;"1986?"
47:29;47:31;"For a French synth artist?"
47:31;47:34;"I'm watching his Moscow show now."
47:34;47:35;"Yeah."
47:35;47:39;"I mean, it's pretty sick looking, but he has those giant inflatable--"
47:39;47:41;"I mean, for the largest show ever."
47:41;47:45;"You know the inflatable guys in front of a car dealership?"
47:45;47:46;"Sure, sure."
47:46;47:47;"Oh, yeah."
47:47;47:48;"Those are his legs."
47:48;47:49;"Oh, that's like Death Spot at MSG."
47:49;47:50;"Yeah, exactly."
47:50;47:54;"Maybe he pulled it from Jean-Michel."
47:54;47:55;"JMJ."
47:55;47:57;"I mean, he does look like he's rocking."
47:57;48:02;"3.5 million people is basically the population of LA."
48:02;48:03;"True. City limits."
48:03;48:04;"Yeah."
48:04;48:06;"That's bigger than Chicago."
48:06;48:08;"For what it's worth, there are no crowd shots."
48:08;48:10;"What was the Porto Potty situation?"
48:10;48:11;"It must have been fierce."
48:11;48:12;"Oh, it must have been insane."
48:12;48:18;"Okay, now I'm just curious about largest ever gathering of human beings."
48:18;48:21;"[laughter]"
48:21;48:25;"Okay, list of largest peaceful gatherings on Wikipedia."
48:25;48:26;"Wow."
48:26;48:29;"Okay, there's a lot of pilgrimages."
48:29;48:37;"They claim that the Kumbh Mela in India, which is a religious gathering--"
48:37;48:42;"I just remembered in that book, Autobiography of a Yogi, he talks about how he met his guru there or something like that."
48:42;48:49;"It's a gathering that happens in India where supposedly every spiritual person comes together in one place."
48:49;48:54;"And I think it happens every-- maybe every six years or something."
48:54;48:56;"So it's a big deal when it happens."
48:56;48:58;"It's like you got to be there."
48:58;49:01;"They're claiming 50 million people, but that's gathering in a city."
49:01;49:04;"That doesn't mean they're in one spot like a concert."
49:04;49:07;"But also, 50 million people, that just takes up a lot of space."
49:07;49:09;"It's not one place at that point."
49:09;49:11;"Yes, exactly."
49:11;49:15;"I mean, let's see, you have some major funerals."
49:15;49:25;"They claim that the funeral of C.N. Anandurai in Tamil Nadu, India, 1969, brought 15 million people."
49:25;49:33;"The funeral of Khomeini in Iran, 1989, they claim they pulled 10 million people."
49:33;49:36;"OK, here's an interesting one, the first one in the US."
49:36;49:44;"4/20/1951, celebration of General Douglas MacArthur being relieved of duty by President Harry S. Truman."
49:44;49:48;"They're claiming they got 7.5 million people in New York."
49:48;49:50;"But what does that mean? That's just the whole city."
49:50;49:55;"Yeah, was it like a parade down Fifth Avenue and people were lined up?"
49:55;50:04;"I don't know. They're claiming that Pope John Paul II pulled 5 million people when he visited the Philippines at World Youth Day '95."
50:04;50:11;"The nice thing about the Apple Vision Pro is that you'll be able to track the numbers with precision."
50:11;50:14;"There's none of this, how many people for Garth Brooks."
50:14;50:16;"It's down to the exact number."
50:16;50:17;"You know what I'm saying?"
50:17;50:18;"You're making a great point."
50:18;50:21;"You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying, though, right?"
50:21;50:22;"Right."
50:22;50:23;"They have geo-tracking."
50:23;50:24;"The biggest con for the, yeah."
50:24;50:25;"Diagnostics."
50:25;50:30;"I like that you're kind of subtly doing a little advertising for the parent company on the show."
50:30;50:31;"I mean, it's organic."
50:31;50:32;"Yeah, I know."
50:32;50:33;"It's organic."
50:33;50:34;"You're a company man."
50:34;50:41;"This claims that 1 million people gathered in the mall outside Buckingham Palace in London for the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Elizabeth II in 2002."
50:41;50:44;"So they're talking about one place, not just the city of London."
50:44;50:48;"The mall outside Buckingham Palace that could hold 1 million people."
50:48;50:49;"All right."
50:49;50:51;"They're saying that there was Earth Day 1990."
50:51;50:55;"There were 1.5 million people in Central Park."
50:55;50:56;"Hmm. Why 90?"
50:56;50:59;"I guess the 20th anniversary started in 70, I think."
50:59;51:01;"Yeah, maybe there's, oh, that makes sense."
51:01;51:04;"Earth Day '90, they're like, we're going to get this handled."
51:04;51:05;"Right."
51:05;51:07;"We've had environmental awareness now for 20 years."
51:07;51:10;"We've got a lot of like momentum behind this."
51:10;51:11;"We got the numbers."
51:11;51:12;"We got this."
51:12;51:13;"In the '90s."
51:13;51:15;"The '90s are going to be sick, man."
51:15;51:16;"We can do this."
51:16;51:17;"All right."
51:17;51:22;"Well, if anybody who's maybe some type of civic engineer or city planner or something, just let us know."
51:22;51:25;"Or maybe even just a concert promoter."
51:25;51:27;"Is it possible to do a 10 million person concert?"
51:27;51:29;"And we don't want to fudge the numbers."
51:29;51:36;"We don't want all this lame 10 million people gathered in the general Manchester area."
51:36;51:40;"Is there a place that we can have 10 million people watching the concert?"
51:40;51:48;"I want everybody to have eyes on a screen, and I don't care if they're five miles away, as long as they're hearing live music blasted through the speakers."
51:48;51:49;"Can we do it?"
51:49;51:51;"And if so, where?"
51:51;51:52;"Is it the Great Steps?"
51:52;51:54;"Is it the Great Plains?"
51:54;51:58;"We'd love to do it in England, if possible."
51:58;52:01;"I think that's where we have the numbers, but let us know."
52:21;52:36;"Just think about this again."
52:36;52:39;"3.5 million people in Moscow."
52:42;52:49;"Honestly, how is there -- people love making spy shows, and everybody loves doing throwback stuff."
52:49;53:03;"How is there not some post-Cold War prestige series that just opens with an undercover CIA agent in the crowd at the 1997 Jean-Michel Jarre concert in Moscow?"
53:03;53:06;"A lot of extras. It sounds pricey."
53:06;53:09;"How about a whole movie that takes place at this concert?"
53:17;53:19;"The perfect crime. 10 million people."
53:19;53:20;"3.5 million people."
53:20;53:23;"3.5 million people get away with anything."
53:23;53:27;"No one's paying attention. All eyes on Jean-Michel."
53:27;53:41;"Or maybe it's more of like a dazed and confused, one crazy day and night, and it's about some young Russian people falling in love, and there's a CIA agent who doesn't
know what to do with himself in the '90s."
53:41;53:42;"He's got the day off."
53:42;53:44;"He's got the day off."
53:44;53:48;"I'm picturing a lot of Pepsi being drunk for some reason. I'm picturing a Pepsi sponsorship."
53:48;53:49;"They're slamming Pepsi."
53:49;53:56;"And it's just these young people, these idealistic young people, bohemians, just slamming Pepsi."
53:56;53:58;"I mean, wow. Yeah, picture that."
53:58;54:01;"[HUMMING]"
54:01;54:11;"1997, if you were like an older person, let's say you were 90, born in 1907, when you were born, there was a czar."
54:11;54:16;"You saw it all. You saw the various revolutions, World War II."
54:16;54:30;"And I mean, to get to 3.5 million people, you saw it all. You saw Lenin, Stalin, the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and maybe the last concert you ever saw,
your grandchildren wheeled you out to--"
54:30;54:32;"I think Putin was in charge in '97."
54:32;54:34;"He was rising in the ranks? Maybe already there?"
54:34;54:35;"I think he was president."
54:42;54:51;"Wow, just picture a 90-year-old Muscovite just reflecting on your whole life at the JMJ concert."
54:51;54:56;"3.5 million people just kind of-- how did they even move to this music?"
54:56;54:57;"That was still Yeltsin."
54:57;54:58;"OK."
54:58;55:00;"Putin, 1999."
55:00;55:01;"'99."
55:01;55:09;"It also kind of makes us Americans-- I think sometimes Daft Punk seems like it's truly from another planet."
55:09;55:14;"Us young Americans, when we first heard Daft Punk in the late '90s, early 2000s."
55:14;55:19;"But you got to keep in mind, Europe is a very different place than America."
55:19;55:22;"There's a lot of context. Amazing artists."
55:22;55:31;"But when Daft Punk was just starting to break in the US, there were also 3.5 million people in Moscow listening to this music."
55:34;55:36;"It's the Twilight Zone over there."
55:36;55:37;"Wow."
55:37;55:38;"America caught up eventually."
55:38;55:40;"Do you know the original Doctor Who?"
55:40;55:41;"Oh, yeah."
55:41;55:42;"Very similar."
55:42;55:44;"I don't know why that makes me think of that."
55:44;55:45;"Spooky."
55:45;55:46;"All right."
55:46;55:48;"Let's do some old music."
55:48;55:51;"Let's talk about some old music."
55:51;55:53;"Just another day on TC talking about old music."
55:53;55:54;"All right."
55:54;55:59;"So let's start out talking about some Longstreet Brothers old music."
55:59;56:02;"I mean, so walk me through this."
56:02;56:03;"OK."
56:03;56:07;"Just tell me the history of you guys and bands."
56:07;56:09;"What was the first band, Jake, that you were in?"
56:09;56:10;"Was it with Dave?"
56:10;56:12;"Or you being older, maybe you had another band?"
56:12;56:13;"I had a few other bands."
56:13;56:16;"I think the first band I was in was called Food."
56:16;56:17;"Very short-lived band."
56:17;56:18;"Food?"
56:18;56:19;"Yeah, Food was the name."
56:19;56:20;"Great name."
56:20;56:21;"Yeah, thanks."
56:21;56:22;"That was in '94."
56:22;56:24;"That was very short-lived, a few weeks."
56:24;56:27;"Weird that there's not a bigger band called Food."
56:27;56:28;"I know."
56:28;56:30;"Food is-- that's an awesome name."
56:30;56:34;"And then I had a high school band called Vince Vince Chlortho."
56:34;56:36;"Was it through with that?"
56:36;56:37;"It's really dumb."
56:37;56:38;"It's like a Ghostbusters reference?"
56:38;56:39;"Yeah, it's a Ghostbusters reference."
56:39;56:40;"We don't need to get into it."
56:40;56:41;"Not worth."
56:41;56:42;"What was the biggest show Food ever played?"
56:42;56:44;"Food played, I think, like a coffee shop."
56:44;56:45;"I did like a summer program."
56:45;56:48;"Food actually did $400,000 in Moscow in '95."
56:48;56:52;"It was part of a weird Building Bridges exchange program."
56:52;56:54;"This was in high school."
56:54;56:58;"And I did like a high school summer program at RISD in Providence."
56:58;57:03;"So I formed Food with my roommate, this guy Matt, who was from Sarasota, Florida,"
57:03;57:05;"who was a really good guitar player."
57:05;57:07;"And I was not a very good guitar player."
57:07;57:09;"So we were just into the same kind of stuff."
57:09;57:11;"So we did like one coffee shop open mic."
57:11;57:13;"Do we have any Food recordings?"
57:13;57:16;"Not that's been transcribed to digital."
57:16;57:18;"I think they're in a box somewhere."
57:18;57:21;"I think there's like one handheld tape recorder."
57:21;57:23;"It's not great."
57:23;57:24;"I mean, a lot of the music will--"
57:24;57:28;"Wait, Matt-- that guy's-- his band in Florida is called Blanket?"
57:28;57:29;"Yeah, Blanket was great."
57:29;57:31;"They're a super good band."
57:31;57:32;"Yeah."
57:32;57:34;"And then, yeah, I had the high school band."
57:34;57:39;"Yeah, so then Dave and I started making music together in 1996."
57:39;57:43;"All right, so '96, you're-- so you're already 19."
57:43;57:44;"Yeah, I'm 19."
57:44;57:45;"Dave's 14."
57:45;57:46;"Interesting."
57:46;57:49;"So how come you guys never came together before that?"
57:49;57:50;"I just think that--"
57:50;57:51;"Tonka truck?"
57:51;57:52;"That--"
57:52;57:53;"Took a while to heal."
57:53;57:54;"Yep."
57:54;57:55;"That took a while to heal."
57:55;57:56;"The Tonka incident."
57:56;58:00;"I just don't think that like a 16-year-old is going to make music with like an 11-year-old."
58:00;58:02;"I guess that's possible."
58:02;58:05;"I mean, I didn't really start getting into playing music till I was like 16 maybe."
58:05;58:06;"Right."
58:06;58:07;"Maybe 17."
58:07;58:08;"So it was kind of new to you."
58:08;58:14;"Yeah, and then so by the time I was 19, I'd played with a few, you know, little bands."
58:14;58:17;"And then Dave was 14, and he was playing music a lot."
58:17;58:20;"So you went to college when you were 18?"
58:20;58:21;"Yeah, yeah, so--"
58:21;58:25;"So it was just like you came home from college, and you came back, and you're just like, ""What's up, little bro?"""
58:25;58:28;"And you're just like, ""Oh, [bleep] little bro getting pretty good at guitar. Okay!"""
58:28;58:29;"No, no, no."
58:29;58:30;"Here's how it went."
58:31;58:39;"I bought a four-track my senior year of high school, made some terrible recordings with my high school band, which we will not be listening to."
58:39;58:40;"Wait, which band?"
58:40;58:41;"Vince--"
58:41;58:42;"Yeah, Vince Vincicorto."
58:42;58:43;"Jake, not terrible."
58:43;58:45;"Jake's real tight-lipped about Vince Vincicorto."
58:45;58:46;"Yeah."
58:46;58:47;"Oh, my God."
58:47;58:48;"I guess--"
58:48;58:51;"We can transfer the tape for a later episode."
58:51;58:53;"It cuts closer to the bone. It's good."
58:53;58:54;"Vince Vincicorto is good."
58:54;58:55;"Yeah, right."
58:55;58:56;"I haven't actually heard that stuff in years."
58:56;58:57;"So you bought the four-track."
58:57;59:06;"Bought the four-track, went away to college fall '95, left the four-track behind. Dave started using it because he was still living at home."
59:06;59:11;"I started a band in eighth grade. It was called the Cartesian Divers."
59:11;59:12;"Oh, right. I've heard of Cartesian Divers."
59:12;59:13;"Great band."
59:13;59:17;"And then, yeah, maybe it was that-- I guess we didn't start American People until you came back."
59:17;59:20;"But were you mailing tapes to Jake?"
59:20;59:21;"Yes."
59:21;59:22;"Yeah, yeah."
59:22;59:26;"So when you were hearing these tapes, is that when you realized you're like, ""Little bro's not so little anymore."""
59:26;59:33;"Yeah, Dave was sending these tapes that were so layered and sophisticated of his eighth grade band."
59:33;59:34;"There was so much--"
59:34;59:37;"Did that blow your mind or you kind of already knew that Dave was an artistic type?"
59:37;59:43;"No, that was like-- I was like, ""Oh, wow. Dave's throwing down with these four-track tapes. These things rule."""
59:43;59:47;"And then so he was already like, you know, recording regularly on four-track."
59:47;59:54;"Then I came home '96 to work like a landscaping job between freshman and sophomore year of college."
59:54;59:57;"So I was living at home for like whatever it was, two, three months."
59:57;01:00:01;"And then we started recording together. We started a band called American People."
01:00:01;01:00:05;"And that was the first true collab."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"Yes."
01:00:06;01:00:07;"Between the brothers."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"How do you remember that time, Dave?"
01:00:09;01:00:14;"Yeah, I mean, same like I started playing the guitar after Jake did."
01:00:14;01:00:20;"He had his like little kind of like three-quarter size nylon string"
01:00:20;01:00:25;"from when my parents had tried to get him lessons when you were 12 or something."
01:00:25;01:00:31;"And Jake strung that upside down for me, showed me how to play ""Come As You Are,"" the riff."
01:00:31;01:00:34;"And then that was kind of the beginning of stuff for me."
01:00:34;01:00:38;"And yeah, I guess I was psyched that Jake left the four-track behind."
01:00:38;01:00:42;"I was a big Vince ""Vince"" Glortho fan, still am."
01:00:42;01:00:43;"And--"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"One grit sandpaper."
01:00:45;01:00:47;"Yeah, that was very early."
01:00:47;01:00:50;"Okay. And when you left, you weren't like, ""Don't touch my stuff."""
01:00:50;01:00:51;"No."
01:00:51;01:00:55;"You're talking to your college roommate, ""Oh my God, look at this letter."
01:00:55;01:00:58;"My little bro's been in my room using my four-track."
01:00:58;01:01:01;"Oh, man, I'm going to beat his ass when I get home."""
01:01:01;01:01:05;"You're like chilled out, roommate from rural Oregon."
01:01:05;01:01:07;"""Hey, man, give it a chance."""
01:01:07;01:01:08;"""Take a listen."""
01:01:08;01:01:11;"""Let's throw it on in my cassette radio."""
01:01:11;01:01:12;"""Okay."""
01:01:12;01:01:14;"You're like, ""No, I'm too pissed."""
01:01:14;01:01:16;"He's like, ""Chill, Jake."""
01:01:16;01:01:18;"Puts it on, you're like, ""Okay."
01:01:18;01:01:21;"I'm a little less angry now."
01:01:21;01:01:24;"Little bro's cooking up something pretty good."""
01:01:24;01:01:27;"So, Dave, what music were you into?"
01:01:27;01:01:31;"It was Nirvana? Nirvana changed your life?"
01:01:31;01:01:34;"I mean, I think I was pretty into Nirvana, pretty into the Beatles,"
01:01:34;01:01:37;"pretty into like Pavement."
01:01:37;01:01:41;"Just trying to think, like Cartesian Divers, Beatles, Pavement."
01:01:41;01:01:42;"I don't think I got into--"
01:01:42;01:01:46;"Cartesian Divers was like an eighth grade Pavement ripoff band."
01:01:46;01:01:47;"Yeah."
01:01:47;01:01:50;"What are some-- do we have any Cartesian Divers?"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"Not today, but we--"
01:01:52;01:01:53;"I just looked on my-- I mean, we do--"
01:01:53;01:01:54;"Oh, you have some?"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"Yeah, let's play one as we're talking about it."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"I want to hear this."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"All right."
01:01:58;01:02:02;"Because we just had-- I had a box of tapes sitting around the last like 25 years,"
01:02:02;01:02:05;"and we just had a friend of ours--"
01:02:05;01:02:06;"Digitize?"
01:02:06;01:02:07;"Exactly."
01:02:07;01:02:11;"But I didn't remember that there was Cartesian Divers stuff in there."
01:02:11;01:02:12;"Oh, here we go."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"Yeah."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"[MUSIC - CARTESIAN DIVERS, ""CARTESIAN DIVERS""]"
01:02:14;01:02:17;"(SINGING) Hey, carpet bagger, get away from me."
01:02:17;01:02:21;"Don't try to coax me with your union money."
01:02:21;01:02:22;"Is that you on vocals?"
01:02:22;01:02:23;"Yeah."
01:02:23;01:02:24;"This is really good."
01:02:24;01:02:28;"For eighth grade, like guitar tone."
01:02:28;01:02:33;"(SINGING) Oh, I'm a sand dropper, and I'm not about to give up my land."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"So good."
01:02:35;01:02:39;"(SINGING) I'm not a trader, and I'm not a scataway."
01:02:39;01:02:42;"So put your things away in your carpet bag."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"Hey, carpet bagger, get away from me."
01:02:44;01:02:47;"I think in history, we were like studying the Reconstruction."
01:02:47;01:02:48;"It's very sophisticated."
01:02:48;01:02:51;"You're singing from the point of view of a Southern man that's"
01:02:51;01:02:52;"been defeated in the Civil War."
01:02:52;01:02:53;"Wow."
01:02:53;01:02:55;"Hey, carpet bagger, stay away from me."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"(SINGING) Don't try to coax me with your union money."
01:02:57;01:03:00;"Don't try to coax me with your union money."
01:03:00;01:03:02;"Also, it's just so tight."
01:03:02;01:03:03;"Robbie Rancourt on drums."
01:03:03;01:03:06;"You'll hear all of my old school recordings."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"Much sloppier than this."
01:03:08;01:03:12;"(SINGING) Every day I work real hard in the field."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"It don't look much, but it's Robots on Wheels."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"Robbie Rancourt, city of town."
01:03:15;01:03:19;"(SINGING) Now, for slavery, slavery is bad."
01:03:19;01:03:23;"These perpetrators are invading our land."
01:03:23;01:03:26;"I'm not a trader, and I'm not a scataway."
01:03:26;01:03:30;"So put your things away in your carpet bag."
01:03:30;01:03:32;"Hey, carpet bagger, get away from me."
01:03:32;01:03:35;"So this is like '95, probably."
01:03:35;01:03:36;"Yeah."
01:03:36;01:03:37;"I think it's the year before American people--"
01:03:37;01:03:39;"I feel like you probably could have gotten signed to Matador"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"with this in '95."
01:03:41;01:03:44;"(SINGING) Don't try to coax me with your corporate arrest."
01:03:44;01:03:50;"Yeah, it's so funny."
01:03:50;01:03:52;"It's like, that stuff seemed like such a world away."
01:03:52;01:03:56;"We didn't know anybody who put out records."
01:03:56;01:03:57;"No."
01:03:57;01:04:03;"I think that's one of the things that I loved about the Beatles"
01:04:03;01:04:06;"is just the sense that they had a four track."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"And we have a four track."
01:04:08;01:04:09;"Yeah, classic."
01:04:09;01:04:10;"Anything's possible."
01:04:10;01:04:22;"And you recorded it all one by one?"
01:04:22;01:04:23;"Drums, bass, guitar, vocals?"
01:04:23;01:04:24;"Oh, yeah."
01:04:24;01:04:25;"One, two, three, four?"
01:04:25;01:04:28;"(SINGING) Don't try to coax me with your corporate arrest."
01:04:28;01:04:32;"I think I'll play with the front letter of the world."
01:04:32;01:04:35;"I think I'll play with the front letter of life."
01:04:35;01:04:39;"(SINGING) It comes in time to get away from me."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"That's a lot of lyrics, too."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"I think, yeah, I don't know."
01:04:43;01:04:46;"This is the pavement rip off sequel to the night"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"they drove old Dixie down."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"[LAUGHS]"
01:04:49;01:04:55;"Wow."
01:04:55;01:04:56;"Anyway, yeah."
01:04:56;01:04:57;"That was great."
01:04:57;01:04:59;"All right, so I could totally-- now I can really picture it."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"Yeah."
01:05:00;01:05:04;"Oh, yeah, so I'm getting that in the mail, like October,"
01:05:04;01:05:08;"'95, and I'm like, OK, this rules."
01:05:08;01:05:10;"Listened to those tapes a lot, played them for my friends"
01:05:10;01:05:11;"a lot."
01:05:11;01:05:14;"Got Katie Davidson, friend of the show, really into--"
01:05:14;01:05:15;"Cartesian divers."
01:05:15;01:05:18;"Yeah, Adam Forkner, a lot of old friends from college."
01:05:18;01:05:22;"Like we're like huge Dave heads for many, many years."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"But long before the Dirty Projectors started."
01:05:24;01:05:27;"Right, because is this like a solid five, six years"
01:05:27;01:05:29;"before any Dirty Projectors?"
01:05:29;01:05:32;"I think the first Projectors is like '03."
01:05:32;01:05:33;"Glad fact."
01:05:33;01:05:36;"Yeah, this is-- we're good eight years out."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"Right."
01:05:37;01:05:40;"So then get back and then just keep"
01:05:40;01:05:43;"it cooking with the four track stuff in '96."
01:05:43;01:05:45;"We play She Don't Love Me first."
01:05:45;01:05:49;"Yeah, so we just kind of like every summer or Christmas"
01:05:49;01:05:53;"break for a few years, we would make a quote album, really"
01:05:53;01:05:54;"more of an EP."
01:05:54;01:05:57;"So you think this is your first summer back from college?"
01:05:57;01:05:58;"Yeah, this is '96."
01:05:58;01:06:02;"I don't know like, yeah, what a kind of like emblematic song"
01:06:02;01:06:03;"of American people would be."
01:06:03;01:06:06;"It seems so weird to start with She Don't Love Me."
01:06:06;01:06:07;"Yeah, it's kind of misleading."
01:06:07;01:06:09;"Or we can start with You Don't Love Me."
01:06:09;01:06:11;"Or we can start with 90s Man."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"I think we've got to start with 90s Man."
01:06:13;01:06:16;"OK, so 90s Man is a song I wrote."
01:06:16;01:06:19;"And you know, it's really-- it's due to my love for the TC"
01:06:19;01:06:23;"community that I'm willing to embarrass myself by--"
01:06:23;01:06:24;"Abase yourself."
01:06:24;01:06:26;"Exactly, by listening to this."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"But it will have-- I was texting with Dave yesterday"
01:06:28;01:06:31;"and it will have strange resonance with I"
01:06:31;01:06:32;"Was Born in the Boom."
01:06:32;01:06:33;"OK."
01:06:33;01:06:35;"I was thinking about-- OK, yeah."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"Yeah, let's listen to 90s Man."
01:06:37;01:06:39;"So this is you guys playing--"
01:06:39;01:06:41;"Jake wrote the song, but you guys played and arranged it"
01:06:41;01:06:42;"together."
01:06:42;01:06:45;"And Jon Joyce from Vince Glortho is on this song as well."
01:06:45;01:06:46;"All right, let's check it out."
01:06:46;01:06:48;"This is probably like June of '96."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"American people with 90s Man."
01:06:50;01:06:53;"[MUSIC - ""90S MAN""]"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"I think that's Jon on bass."
01:06:55;01:06:58;"[MUSIC - ""90S MAN""]"
01:06:58;01:07:05;"[LAUGHS]"
01:07:05;01:07:07;"I got to tell you, I love this."
01:07:07;01:07:09;"This is like Moldy Peaches or something, huh, man?"
01:07:09;01:07:10;"Oh, yeah."
01:07:10;01:07:13;"[MUSIC - ""90S MAN""]"
01:07:13;01:07:17;"(SINGING) We'll discuss poetry till the bitter end."
01:07:21;01:07:25;"'Cause I'm thoughtful and I'm resourceful."
01:07:25;01:07:31;"I'm a 90s man going out of my head."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"I'm a 90s man."
01:07:33;01:07:35;"Oh, that was funny."
01:07:35;01:07:36;"That really sounds like you."
01:07:36;01:07:37;"Dave's in there."
01:07:37;01:07:39;"I couldn't really recognize your voice on--"
01:07:39;01:07:40;"Oh, here we go."
01:07:40;01:07:41;"--the Cartesian Divers."
01:07:41;01:07:45;"(SINGING) The world wide web is here today."
01:07:45;01:07:46;"[LAUGHS]"
01:07:46;01:07:47;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:07:47;01:07:49;"(SINGING) It's the wave of the future."
01:07:49;01:07:54;"I've got so much on my mind these days."
01:07:54;01:08:01;"Like the issues at hand spreading across our land."
01:08:01;01:08:05;"'Cause I'm a man within a global community."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"[LAUGHS]"
01:08:06;01:08:09;"(SINGING) I'm a 90s man."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"Whoa."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"He's so close."
01:08:11;01:08:14;"[MUSIC - ""90S MAN""]"
01:08:18;01:08:21;"An ironic Gen X anthem for the era."
01:08:21;01:08:21;"Yeah."
01:08:21;01:08:26;"Part of the global community."
01:08:26;01:08:26;"Yeah, man."
01:08:26;01:08:28;"World wide web is here to stay."
01:08:28;01:08:30;"It's the wave of the future."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"Just like reading Newsweek articles about that"
01:08:32;01:08:33;"and just being like, OK."
01:08:33;01:08:36;"With that being like sarcastic somehow."
01:08:36;01:08:37;"Totally."
01:08:37;01:08:46;"OK, this third verse is not as hot, but it's all good."
01:08:47;01:08:51;"It's very sarcastic about the future."
01:08:51;01:08:55;"(SINGING) I've got my life together, or so it seems."
01:08:55;01:08:56;"Together."
01:08:56;01:08:59;"Is your vocal influence Malcolm is here?"
01:08:59;01:09:00;"I don't know, dude."
01:09:00;01:09:03;"(SINGING) I know who my friends are and what the hell they need."
01:09:03;01:09:09;"And I'm responsible."
01:09:09;01:09:15;"And I know what the hell is going on around me all the time."
01:09:15;01:09:17;"You really have to swear so darn hard."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"(SINGING) I'm a 90s man."
01:09:18;01:09:26;"I'm a 90s man."
01:09:26;01:09:30;"John Joyce."
01:09:30;01:09:31;"Yeah."
01:09:31;01:09:32;"(SINGING) Resourceful."
01:09:32;01:09:33;"Dave."
01:09:33;01:09:34;"Yeah."
01:09:34;01:09:38;"(SINGING) Buying all of the stereo designs."
01:09:41;01:09:45;"I mean, you guys already have a real knack for arrangement."
01:09:45;01:09:46;"You know, like--"
01:09:46;01:09:47;"I guess."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"And I've got mail."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"Oh, yeah."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"And I've got mail."
01:09:51;01:09:54;"(SINGING) I'm a 90s man."
01:09:54;01:09:59;"So this is 1996?"
01:09:59;01:10:00;"Yeah."
01:10:00;01:10:01;"Summer of '96."
01:10:02;01:10:05;"(SINGING) I'm a 90s man."
01:10:05;01:10:07;"It's funny to think."
01:10:07;01:10:09;"It feels sad, though, Jake."
01:10:09;01:10:10;"Great."
01:10:10;01:10:13;"OK Computer had not come out yet."
01:10:13;01:10:14;"No, man."
01:10:14;01:10:15;"Bump on the Benz."
01:10:15;01:10:16;"Yep."
01:10:16;01:10:18;"Benz era."
01:10:18;01:10:19;"Wow."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"Yeah."
01:10:20;01:10:21;"Great song."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"Goofy."
01:10:22;01:10:25;"But already some of that trademark Jake's tics."
01:10:25;01:10:28;"All the global community talk, World Wide Web."
01:10:28;01:10:29;"It's actually--"
01:10:29;01:10:30;"It's so true."
01:10:30;01:10:32;"I was thinking-- I listened to it yesterday,"
01:10:32;01:10:33;"and I was like, oh my god."
01:10:33;01:10:36;"This is like-- almost like it's like a funny--"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"like it made me think of Merle Haggard,"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"""Okie from Muskogee."""
01:10:40;01:10:42;"Where it's sort of like, is it sarcastic?"
01:10:42;01:10:46;"Or is it a parody or not?"
01:10:46;01:10:49;"Because it's sung from the point of view of a reactionary."
01:10:49;01:10:52;"It was like all this newfangled stuff."
01:10:52;01:10:53;"I don't like it."
01:10:53;01:10:55;"Kid smoking weed, World Wide Web, whatever."
01:10:55;01:10:56;"I don't like any of it."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"Although here--"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"But then it's sort of like, is it--"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"But the guy is saying that he likes it."
01:11:00;01:11:01;"I mean, kind of."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"But you're sort of mocking the guy."
01:11:03;01:11:04;"It comes off as sarcastic."
01:11:04;01:11:05;"I don't--"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"Well, I mean, if it was a Talking Head song,"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"it would be kind of like sincere."
01:11:09;01:11:11;"We talked about the classic-- the Talking Heads vibe"
01:11:11;01:11:14;"of just listing aspects of modern technology"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"and all the people in the buildings and the highways"
01:11:16;01:11:17;"and stuff."
01:11:17;01:11:21;"And it kind of reads as sincere, just like, wow, modern world."
01:11:21;01:11:22;"Look at that."
01:11:22;01:11:23;"The modern world's pretty neat."
01:11:23;01:11:25;"I don't really remember my mindset exactly."
01:11:25;01:11:26;"I think it--"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"It's kind of interesting that it's like,"
01:11:28;01:11:29;"you can't tell, really."
01:11:29;01:11:31;"I mean, I think that's the pavement part."
01:11:31;01:11:32;"It's like, cut your hair or something."
01:11:32;01:11:34;"I mean, it's like there's--"
01:11:34;01:11:37;"it's very specific that Gen X '90s."
01:11:37;01:11:41;"Like, there's-- it's ironic, but it's not so ironic"
01:11:41;01:11:42;"that you don't mean it."
01:11:42;01:11:43;"It's just sort of--"
01:11:43;01:11:44;"Right."
01:11:44;01:11:45;"I was thinking about that."
01:11:45;01:11:46;"It's fully protected."
01:11:47;01:11:48;"That's interesting."
01:11:48;01:11:50;"On the drive over, I was thinking about,"
01:11:50;01:11:53;"I was born in the boom."
01:11:53;01:11:56;"And how, like, how boomerish it is to, like,"
01:11:56;01:11:59;"place yourself at the center of a heroic narrative."
01:11:59;01:12:00;"Right."
01:12:00;01:12:01;"And then this is equal--"
01:12:01;01:12:03;"I mean, this is kind of the point you made earlier."
01:12:03;01:12:06;"It's like, kind of, like, perfectly Gen X"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"to just be--"
01:12:08;01:12:11;"sort of be mused."
01:12:11;01:12:12;"Right."
01:12:12;01:12:13;"It's the wave of the future."
01:12:13;01:12:16;"Yeah, and kind of have this-- yeah, this feeling of just,"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"like, well, this is happening."
01:12:18;01:12:19;"A little more nihilistic."
01:12:19;01:12:20;"If the boomer--"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"Passive."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"Yeah, passive."
01:12:22;01:12:23;"The boomer's more like, what?"
01:12:23;01:12:24;"I was born in the boom."
01:12:25;01:12:28;"Or, of course, we didn't start the fire."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"Just like--"
01:12:29;01:12:30;"Right, of course."
01:12:30;01:12:31;"--angry, just like, all this stuff's happening."
01:12:31;01:12:33;"I say."
01:12:33;01:12:35;"Jake's the '90s man who's just kind of like,"
01:12:35;01:12:38;"within a global community."
01:12:38;01:12:40;"World Wide Web."
01:12:40;01:12:41;"It's here to stay."
01:12:41;01:12:43;"Yeah, I mean, it's the passive."
01:12:43;01:12:45;"It's-- everything I've been told, everything I'm reading,"
01:12:45;01:12:47;"OK, get some."
01:12:47;01:12:49;"I'm just kind of browsing a Newsweek"
01:12:49;01:12:52;"while I eat a plate of nachos here at the kitchen counter."
01:12:52;01:12:53;"Right."
01:12:53;01:12:56;"They tell me it's a digital era, OK."
01:12:56;01:12:57;"All right."
01:12:57;01:12:58;"Sure."
01:12:58;01:12:59;"Whatever."
01:12:59;01:13:01;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:13:01;01:13:02;"Internet, whatever."
01:13:02;01:13:04;"They tell me I'm part of a global community."
01:13:04;01:13:07;"Oh, yeah, it's very influenced by Beavis and Butthead, maybe."
01:13:07;01:13:09;"Like, global community."
01:13:09;01:13:10;"Right."
01:13:10;01:13:12;"But you're also-- you're sophisticated enough"
01:13:12;01:13:16;"that you don't go into that annoying tone of just be--"
01:13:16;01:13:17;"of like, internet?"
01:13:17;01:13:19;"Who cares?"
01:13:19;01:13:20;"Global community?"
01:13:20;01:13:21;"Snooze."
01:13:21;01:13:22;"It's a little-- it's drier than that."
01:13:22;01:13:23;"Yeah, it's drier."
01:13:23;01:13:24;"You just lay it out."
01:13:24;01:13:25;"It's cool."
01:13:25;01:13:26;"What should we listen to next?"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"Let's do ""She Don't Love Me."""
01:13:28;01:13:31;"This is from the same summer '96 sessions."
01:13:31;01:13:34;"This is like-- this is Dave on vocals."
01:13:34;01:13:35;"Well, no, we're both on vocals."
01:13:35;01:13:36;"You're in the chorus."
01:13:36;01:13:37;"We're doing British accents."
01:13:37;01:13:38;"OK."
01:13:38;01:13:41;"It's like 19-- we're trying to do like an '80s song."
01:13:41;01:13:42;"OK."
01:13:42;01:13:43;"In 1996."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"All right, let's check it out."
01:13:44;01:13:47;"[MUSIC - DAVE ON VOCALS, ""SHE DON'T LOVE ME""]"
01:13:47;01:13:55;"Oh."
01:13:55;01:14:02;"Oh, we started dancing under the muddy sky."
01:14:02;01:14:08;"And I stood up and I moved my heart."
01:14:08;01:14:09;"Dave's 14."
01:14:09;01:14:15;"We started walking along the muddy beach."
01:14:15;01:14:18;"And the moon was high above."
01:14:18;01:14:20;"The other way, time to begin."
01:14:24;01:14:27;"And I knew you loved me."
01:14:27;01:14:31;"And I knew you loved me."
01:14:31;01:14:33;"And I knew you loved me."
01:14:33;01:14:34;"Wow."
01:14:34;01:14:37;"And I knew you loved me."
01:14:37;01:14:47;"Yeah, Lisa, the time for me."
01:14:47;01:14:50;"Caught me by surprise."
01:14:50;01:14:52;"And I knew you loved me."
01:14:56;01:14:58;"It's very Purgualva."
01:14:58;01:15:00;"If they had done like an '80s--"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"You were a massive Ween fan at this point."
01:15:02;01:15:04;"Yes, we both were."
01:15:04;01:15:06;"She don't love me."
01:15:06;01:15:09;"Hey, she don't love me."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"They don't love me."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"You guys invented electroclash."
01:15:13;01:15:15;"Just a little bit too early."
01:15:15;01:15:18;"This solo's sick."
01:15:18;01:15:20;"What keyboard were you using?"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"I think it was like a Korg."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"It was a Korg of some kind."
01:15:24;01:15:26;"Maybe an X5."
01:15:26;01:15:29;"She don't love me."
01:15:29;01:15:32;"Hey, she don't love me."
01:15:35;01:15:39;"Hey, she don't love me."
01:15:39;01:15:42;"Yeah, Korg X5."
01:15:42;01:15:45;"She don't love me."
01:15:45;01:15:48;"I remember that like pitch shifter pedal."
01:15:48;01:15:50;"Yeah, the boss."
01:15:50;01:15:52;"Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo maybe?"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"I remember this song."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"It's amazing I remember this."
01:15:56;01:15:58;"The entire song was just the keyboard through--"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"Oh, and you were kind of doing those real-time effects."
01:16:00;01:16:02;"The like pitch shifter."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"There was no guitars or anything."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"It was just like--"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"Sounds sick."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"She don't love me."
01:16:10;01:16:12;"Let's do ""You don't love me."""
01:16:12;01:16:14;"I remember they were back-to-back on the tape."
01:16:14;01:16:16;"They had like Beach Boys,"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"or like Gary Lewis and the Playboys."
01:16:18;01:16:20;"Kind of like '60s bubble gum."
01:16:20;01:16:22;"Okay."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"""You don't love me."""
01:16:24;01:16:27;"Studio Shatter?"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"Classic."
01:16:29;01:16:34;"I remember church bells ringing"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"And I remember you"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"Oh, I've heard this one."
01:16:38;01:16:42;"That you don't love me anymore"
01:16:42;01:16:46;"I remember one"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"This is the closest to ""We."""
01:16:48;01:16:50;"Maybe, yeah, with that like"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"sort of swirling keyboards in the back."
01:16:52;01:16:54;"To be mine"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"Was that a dream or reality?"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"This is a real duet,"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"'cause Dave comes in here."
01:17:00;01:17:05;"Follow me down a garden path"
01:17:05;01:17:09;"Where no one knows your name"
01:17:09;01:17:12;"If you know what I mean"
01:17:12;01:17:17;"And I mean what I say"
01:17:17;01:17:22;"I remember church bells ringing"
01:17:22;01:17:26;"And I remember you were singing"
01:17:26;01:17:30;"That you don't love me anymore"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"Yeah, the oldies station in our area"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"was called Big D-103."
01:17:34;01:17:36;"Yeah."
01:17:36;01:17:40;"And Big D-103 has probably come up on Time Crisis."
01:17:40;01:17:42;"Yeah, no, that was the oldies."
01:17:42;01:17:44;"You send them a tape of American people?"
01:17:44;01:17:47;"No, we really should have."
01:17:47;01:17:53;"Follow me down a garden path"
01:17:53;01:17:58;"Where no one knows your name"
01:17:58;01:18:02;"If you know what I mean"
01:18:02;01:18:05;"And I mean what I say"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"What do those lyrics mean?"
01:18:07;01:18:10;"If you know what I mean and I mean what I say."
01:18:10;01:18:12;"Church bells ringing"
01:18:12;01:18:16;"And I remember you were singing"
01:18:16;01:18:20;"That you don't love me anymore"
01:18:24;01:18:27;"Yeah, this is super ""Wean,"" yeah."
01:18:27;01:18:31;"I mean, I think with ""Wean,"" too, it was like"
01:18:31;01:18:33;"these dudes just have a four track."
01:18:33;01:18:36;"I think I thought that ""Wean"" were actually brothers."
01:18:36;01:18:38;"Because their names were Dean and Gene."
01:18:38;01:18:41;"Also, GBV, too."
01:18:41;01:18:42;"Oh, yeah."
01:18:42;01:18:43;"We were real into that, too."
01:18:43;01:18:45;"That didn't come later?"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"I think in '96, '97, yeah, we were,"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"at least I was in, yeah."
01:18:49;01:18:50;"Yeah."
01:18:50;01:18:53;"What was the, was there an American people hit?"
01:18:53;01:18:55;"What did your parents think of the band?"
01:18:55;01:18:58;"Were they like, ""Oh, I like 'She Don't Love Me.'"""
01:18:58;01:19:02;"I think ""90s Man,"" that had some like--"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"Oh, yeah, Mom liked ""90s Man."""
01:19:04;01:19:05;"Yeah."
01:19:05;01:19:06;"But did we play it for them?"
01:19:06;01:19:07;"Yeah, I think a little bit."
01:19:07;01:19:08;"How many tapes were made?"
01:19:08;01:19:09;"Who else had copies?"
01:19:09;01:19:11;"Probably like a half dozen."
01:19:11;01:19:13;"Steve Schrader, Katy."
01:19:13;01:19:15;"It was like strictly a recording project."
01:19:15;01:19:16;"We never--"
01:19:16;01:19:17;"We printed 20,000 copies."
01:19:17;01:19:19;"[laughter]"
01:19:19;01:19:20;"We never--"
01:19:20;01:19:21;"It was a big hit in Russia."
01:19:21;01:19:22;"Right."
01:19:22;01:19:25;"Did ""90s Man"" ever get played at like Lewis and Clark Radio?"
01:19:25;01:19:28;"No, not radio, but I played it sometimes with like"
01:19:28;01:19:31;"various musical projects I had in college."
01:19:31;01:19:32;"Okay."
01:19:32;01:19:33;"I had a lot of short-lived bands."
01:19:33;01:19:35;"One was called the Navin R. Johnsons,"
01:19:35;01:19:37;"which I did not name, never liked the name."
01:19:37;01:19:39;"Don't like the movie ""The Jerk."""
01:19:39;01:19:41;"It was a reference to the Steve Martin character."
01:19:41;01:19:43;"But we would play that one."
01:19:43;01:19:45;"That was a band with Katy and Richie"
01:19:45;01:19:47;"before ""Dear Nora"" started."
01:19:47;01:19:48;"Anyway, we would play that one."
01:19:48;01:19:50;"I think we did ""You Don't Love Me,"" too."
01:19:50;01:19:52;"Everybody brought their own material?"
01:19:52;01:19:53;"Kind of."
01:19:53;01:19:56;"So we would do ""90s Man"" in like '96."
01:19:56;01:19:58;"I know, dude."
01:19:58;01:20:00;"But it was really just a recording thing."
01:20:00;01:20:03;"Never even thought about playing a show."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"But also, like, Ezra,"
01:20:05;01:20:08;"I mean, we got to get into your juvenilia"
01:20:08;01:20:11;"and early in young manhood."
01:20:11;01:20:13;"I almost feel like it's a difference"
01:20:13;01:20:16;"between two different corners of the tri-state area"
01:20:16;01:20:17;"in the sense that you're just like"
01:20:17;01:20:20;"so much more connected to New York."
01:20:20;01:20:23;"And so the idea of shows, concerts, and stuff,"
01:20:23;01:20:24;"it never even--"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"Of going into the city?"
01:20:26;01:20:27;"Or even just doing your own."
01:20:27;01:20:28;"That's an interesting point."
01:20:28;01:20:29;"Or like, I don't know, just like--"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"Any kind of live performance."
01:20:31;01:20:32;"If you made a band, you thought,"
01:20:32;01:20:34;"""Oh, there's probably places you could play."""
01:20:34;01:20:36;"It literally didn't even occur to me."
01:20:36;01:20:38;"Yeah, 'cause you guys are like,"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"you were vaguely rural Connecticut?"
01:20:40;01:20:41;"Yeah."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"We were in a town that,"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"when my parents moved there in the 1970s,"
01:20:45;01:20:46;"was rural."
01:20:46;01:20:48;"And by the time the '90s came around,"
01:20:48;01:20:52;"it was pretty like Blockbuster Video and Starbucked out."
01:20:52;01:20:55;"But it was, it still always had this quaint"
01:20:55;01:20:58;"kind of New England feel to it."
01:20:58;01:20:59;"And there's parts of it did."
01:20:59;01:21:02;"Yeah, that's not my part of Jersey quite."
01:21:02;01:21:03;"Yeah."
01:21:03;01:21:05;"My part of Jersey is very dense."
01:21:05;01:21:07;"So it's like, if you saw my town,"
01:21:07;01:21:10;"you'd be like, ""Oh, it's green and nice."""
01:21:10;01:21:13;"But it's still, like I've said many times,"
01:21:13;01:21:14;"my favorite fun fact,"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"I actually got to drop this at somebody the other night,"
01:21:16;01:21:19;"an LA guy who lived in New Jersey for a while"
01:21:19;01:21:20;"and then came back to Montclair."
01:21:20;01:21:22;"Sorry, he lived in this town in New Jersey called Montclair"
01:21:22;01:21:24;"and then he came back to LA."
01:21:24;01:21:26;"And so we were talking about his time in Jersey"
01:21:26;01:21:28;"and he didn't realize this,"
01:21:28;01:21:31;"which is that New Jersey has more towns than California."
01:21:31;01:21:33;"So anytime I meet somebody with a connection to both places,"
01:21:33;01:21:34;"I got to drop that."
01:21:34;01:21:35;"Wow."
01:21:35;01:21:36;"His mind was blown."
01:21:36;01:21:37;"Yeah, that's a nugget."
01:21:37;01:21:38;"So many little towns."
01:21:38;01:21:40;"Even though Southern Jersey is like real rural."
01:21:40;01:21:43;"Yeah, but I guess there's still just a lot of smaller municipalities."
01:21:43;01:21:47;"But like where I lived in Essex County,"
01:21:47;01:21:50;"you could literally in five minutes,"
01:21:50;01:21:51;"you could drive through five towns."
01:21:51;01:21:52;"Right."
01:21:52;01:21:54;"And I remember like recently you were talking about"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"going to like noise shows in like New Brunswick."
01:21:56;01:21:57;"Yeah."
01:21:57;01:21:58;"Was that in high school?"
01:21:58;01:21:59;"No, that was when--"
01:21:59;01:22:00;"At Rutgers or--"
01:22:00;01:22:01;"Yeah, because I had some older friends."
01:22:01;01:22:03;"So people went to Rutgers and moved there."
01:22:03;01:22:05;"But yeah, we did play a lot of shows."
01:22:05;01:22:07;"And actually when I get into some of my material,"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"there's a lot of live stuff."
01:22:09;01:22:10;"Oh, cool."
01:22:10;01:22:11;"Which is interesting."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"And also it's funny too because the town we grew up in,"
01:22:13;01:22:15;"Glen Ridge, is very small."
01:22:15;01:22:20;"But it's next to a bigger, slightly better known suburb called Montclair."
01:22:20;01:22:23;"And Montclair is--"
01:22:23;01:22:25;"there's definitely a huge contingent of people"
01:22:25;01:22:29;"who move from the Upper West Side or Brooklyn to Montclair."
01:22:29;01:22:30;"So you're right."
01:22:30;01:22:33;"There's like a bigger connection to New York"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"and people's parents work in New York."
01:22:35;01:22:37;"I'm sure you guys said that in Connecticut too."
01:22:37;01:22:40;"But a lot of people like from New York."
01:22:40;01:22:43;"You know, like the fact that my dad's from the Bronx"
01:22:43;01:22:46;"and my cousin Asher, part of the TC family,"
01:22:46;01:22:48;"he grew up one town over Montclair."
01:22:48;01:22:50;"His parents are from Brooklyn and Queens."
01:22:50;01:22:51;"Very typical."
01:22:51;01:22:54;"So yeah, of course, you still have your grandparents live in the city."
01:22:54;01:22:56;"You probably go to the city more."
01:22:56;01:22:59;"But even then, maybe just the fact that it was dense,"
01:22:59;01:23:02;"there just were a lot of shows happening."
01:23:02;01:23:03;"So it's funny."
01:23:03;01:23:07;"When I found this treasure trove of all these old recordings,"
01:23:07;01:23:09;"I was calling some of my friends and I was like,"
01:23:09;01:23:12;"""Can you remember how we even knew these shows were happening?"""
01:23:12;01:23:15;"Because a lot of them were in Montclair in a church basement"
01:23:15;01:23:17;"that some local kids had organized."
01:23:17;01:23:19;"Because I was like--"
01:23:19;01:23:20;"This is high school."
01:23:21;01:23:22;"I just literally couldn't remember."
01:23:22;01:23:24;"I was like, ""Were we like emailing?"
01:23:24;01:23:26;"Were we using AIM?"
01:23:26;01:23:28;"How did we know to go--?"""
01:23:28;01:23:30;"So this would have been like around 2000?"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"Yeah, exactly."
01:23:32;01:23:33;"What years were you in high school?"
01:23:33;01:23:37;"I was in high school from '98 to 2002."
01:23:37;01:23:38;"Okay."
01:23:38;01:23:41;"Yeah, so '99, 2000, 2001, that was a sweet spot."
01:23:41;01:23:43;"And then when all our older friends went to college,"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"we'd go play--"
01:23:44;01:23:49;"I played a show at Johns Hopkins in a basement or stuff like that."
01:23:49;01:23:50;"There's a lot of that happening."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"And then also, sometimes we would just set up"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"and play our own shows on the street."
01:23:54;01:23:55;"Wow."
01:23:55;01:23:56;"There's stuff like that."
01:23:56;01:23:57;"That's cool."
01:23:57;01:24:00;"So yeah, I remember a lot of moving equipment"
01:24:00;01:24:04;"in a series of vehicles."
01:24:04;01:24:07;"Yeah, this is way more isolated, what we were up to."
01:24:07;01:24:08;"Right."
01:24:08;01:24:10;"Yeah, there was a sense of--"
01:24:10;01:24:11;"and maybe we had a bigger crew."
01:24:11;01:24:13;"I mean, even though we were just a small town,"
01:24:13;01:24:16;"we had definitely a crew of five or six people"
01:24:16;01:24:18;"who were all maybe even slightly more--"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"who were all roughly into the same type of music"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"and liked to get together."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"So you had a few bands in high school."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"In fact, I'm not even sure where to start."
01:24:26;01:24:27;"I mean, maybe I'll--"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"this will be a two-parter, so I could--"
01:24:29;01:24:30;"Should we go back and forth?"
01:24:30;01:24:32;"--start off a little bit."
01:24:32;01:24:33;"Well, here's the thing."
01:24:33;01:24:36;"So my boy Andre, very influential figure in my life."
01:24:36;01:24:39;"I was talking to him before the show started."
01:24:39;01:24:43;"He was a senior when I was a freshman."
01:24:43;01:24:44;"Oh, I didn't realize that."
01:24:44;01:24:45;"Yeah, yeah, he's older."
01:24:45;01:24:47;"And we lived in such a small town,"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"you kind of knew everybody."
01:24:48;01:24:52;"So Wes, Wes Miles, who's going to call in on the next episode,"
01:24:52;01:24:56;"one of my best friends going back to, I think, the age of four."
01:24:56;01:24:57;"We're the same age."
01:24:57;01:24:59;"But then Wes had an older brother,"
01:24:59;01:25:02;"and we met guys when we got to high school like Andre."
01:25:02;01:25:03;"So he was a senior."
01:25:03;01:25:04;"We were freshmen."
01:25:04;01:25:07;"And he was always a cool guy, lived near me,"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"and always had great taste."
01:25:09;01:25:13;"So I was saying to Jake before, just to contextualize Andre,"
01:25:13;01:25:17;"who always leaned a little bit punk rock in a very cool way."
01:25:17;01:25:19;"If you met somebody who was like, yeah,"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"I was kind of into punk rock in high school,"
01:25:21;01:25:22;"sometimes it could be like, yikes."
01:25:22;01:25:24;"But he always had great taste."
01:25:24;01:25:25;"So he was like--"
01:25:25;01:25:28;"I was saying, for instance, he was a dude who in 1998"
01:25:28;01:25:32;"was obsessed with the television album Marquee Moon."
01:25:32;01:25:35;"And once The Strokes came out in 2001,"
01:25:35;01:25:38;"you meet all sorts of dweebs who listen to Marquee Moon."
01:25:38;01:25:42;"To just be like a regular dude in high school in 1998,"
01:25:42;01:25:44;"just be jamming Marquee Moon all the time,"
01:25:44;01:25:46;"you had to be a different type of person."
01:25:46;01:25:47;"For sure."
01:25:47;01:25:48;"Which he was."
01:25:48;01:25:49;"He always had great taste."
01:25:49;01:25:51;"Was that your first encounter with television?"
01:25:51;01:25:55;"Well, I was lucky because my dad also was a bit of a punk rocker"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"with great taste."
01:25:56;01:25:59;"So we did have the Marquee Moon record at home."
01:25:59;01:26:02;"I was not hip to Marquee Moon in 1998."
01:26:02;01:26:03;"And I was 21."
01:26:03;01:26:04;"Really?"
01:26:04;01:26:05;"Yeah."
01:26:05;01:26:08;"Yeah, see, when I just started getting interested in original punk rock,"
01:26:08;01:26:13;"I was very lucky that my dad had the first four Talking Heads records"
01:26:13;01:26:16;"and Marquee Moon and the first couple Ramones records."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"That's so cool."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Madness and Squeeze and stuff."
01:26:19;01:26:20;"On vinyl?"
01:26:20;01:26:21;"And Elvis Costello, yeah."
01:26:21;01:26:25;"Yeah, he would like, you know, he stopped buying records once he,"
01:26:25;01:26:28;"around 1984 when he became a dad and stuff."
01:26:28;01:26:29;"Wasn't his last record?"
01:26:29;01:26:30;"Run DMC."
01:26:30;01:26:31;"The first Run DMC record."
01:26:31;01:26:33;"Which is the first tape I ever bought."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"Oh, crazy."
01:26:34;01:26:35;"Wow."
01:26:35;01:26:36;"So days between."
01:26:36;01:26:37;"Days between."
01:26:37;01:26:38;"Albums between."
01:26:38;01:26:39;"Yeah, so my dad, he's born in 1950,"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"so he has great records from the '60s and stuff."
01:26:41;01:26:45;"But he always had like, his taste was always like a lean cooler."
01:26:45;01:26:48;"So he has like cool old blues records and like a lot of Rolling Stones records."
01:26:48;01:26:50;"Not that much Beatles."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"Kind of basic."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"Yeah."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"Well, kind of like."
01:26:53;01:26:54;"You could hear that anywhere."
01:26:54;01:26:55;"The Beatles?"
01:26:55;01:26:56;"Yeah."
01:26:56;01:26:57;"Yeah, I think a little bit."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"So you could see how, I'm sure there are a lot of people like him who probably,"
01:26:59;01:27:03;"you know, in the '60s, they probably liked the Kinks and the Rolling Stones."
01:27:03;01:27:04;"And they're like, what about the Beatles?"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"Like, they're good, you know."
01:27:06;01:27:07;"Not as in."
01:27:07;01:27:08;"That is very cool guy."
01:27:08;01:27:11;"I remember like being so annoyed with dudes like that, actually."
01:27:11;01:27:13;"Like who I'd meet like in art school and they'd be like,"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"the Kinks are actually better than the Beatles."
01:27:15;01:27:19;"And I'd just be like, okay, dude, you can like have that hot take,"
01:27:19;01:27:20;"but come on."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"Right."
01:27:21;01:27:22;"You got to respect the Beatles."
01:27:22;01:27:23;"Be real."
01:27:23;01:27:24;"You got to respect the Beatles."
01:27:24;01:27:25;"I think my dad respects the Beatles, but the."
01:27:25;01:27:27;"I'm going to have it out with your dad."
01:27:27;01:27:29;"No, no, he respects the Beatles."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"He always thought their harmonies were great,"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"but I could totally see why some was like, but you know,"
01:27:33;01:27:34;"I like the Stones better."
01:27:34;01:27:35;"You can't argue with that."
01:27:35;01:27:36;"I can see that."
01:27:36;01:27:39;"The Kinks to me are not even in the same ballpark as the Beatles and the Stones,"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"but that's a different episode, different conversation."
01:27:41;01:27:43;"All I'm saying is you can picture like a guy like him,"
01:27:43;01:27:48;"by the time you get to the '70s and you start hearing like the Ramones"
01:27:48;01:27:51;"and Marquee Moon, you could probably feel like great."
01:27:51;01:27:54;"This is cool in the same way that the stuff I liked in the '60s was cool."
01:27:54;01:27:57;"I remember"
01:27:57;01:28:01;"how the darkness doubled"
01:28:01;01:28:04;"I recall"
01:28:04;01:28:08;"lightning struck itself"
01:28:08;01:28:12;"I was listening,"
01:28:12;01:28:16;"listening to the rain"
01:28:16;01:28:20;"I was listening,"
01:28:20;01:28:25;"listening to the rain"
01:28:25;01:28:28;"I was hearing,"
01:28:28;01:28:32;"hearing something else"
01:28:32;01:28:37;"playing in bright rhythm"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"Did he like Zeppelin?"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"No."
01:29:10;01:29:14;"I bet he would have thought Zeppelin was kind of dweeby or just like..."
01:29:14;01:29:15;"What about like Elton John?"
01:29:15;01:29:17;"He might have kind of liked Elton John."
01:29:17;01:29:19;"What about the Velvets?"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"He had the first Velvet Underground record."
01:29:21;01:29:23;"I don't know when he bought it."
01:29:23;01:29:25;"He didn't have any Lou Reed solo material."
01:29:25;01:29:27;"No Eagles or anything."
01:29:27;01:29:28;"No, definitely no Eagles."
01:29:28;01:29:29;"It was very cool stuff."
01:29:29;01:29:32;"Yeah, but also like classic country music."
01:29:32;01:29:33;"Loved reggae."
01:29:33;01:29:34;"Really good."
01:29:34;01:29:38;"Your dad's like the coolest record store guy ever."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"Yeah, no."
01:29:39;01:29:40;"It's a very urbane collection."
01:29:40;01:29:41;"Yeah."
01:29:41;01:29:43;"And also, but it's very specific."
01:29:43;01:29:44;"I don't know how to describe it."
01:29:44;01:29:45;"I don't know if it's like a New York thing,"
01:29:45;01:29:48;"but it's not like he had any like can records."
01:29:48;01:29:50;"I think he would just be like a dude in New York,"
01:29:50;01:29:52;"listen to radio and probably like hear television,"
01:29:52;01:29:53;"be like, ""That's cool. I'm going to buy that."""
01:29:53;01:29:56;"You know, and I can totally see how the Ramones probably like,"
01:29:56;01:29:59;"he probably loved the sensibility and thought it was funny."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"And then he loved the British stuff."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"Like I said, Madness and the Specials."
01:30:03;01:30:05;"So yeah, we had a copy of Marquee Moon in the house."
01:30:05;01:30:09;"But you know, like also, I especially picture being 14,"
01:30:09;01:30:13;"I can totally imagine like knowing the record a little bit,"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"but then, you know, sometimes you meet like a,"
01:30:15;01:30:17;"you make a friend, especially at that age,"
01:30:17;01:30:19;"and they're like telling you what's so cool about it."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"And like suddenly you're like, ""Oh yeah, this rules."""
01:30:21;01:30:25;"Like, you know, so both things impacted me."
01:30:25;01:30:28;"So anyway, Andre, he's like a great archivist,"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"and he had saved so much stuff."
01:30:30;01:30:32;"So I started looking through this folder,"
01:30:32;01:30:36;"and I was pretty blown away because not only did it have,"
01:30:36;01:30:39;"our main high school band was called the Sophisticuffs."
01:30:39;01:30:40;"I did not come up with a name."
01:30:40;01:30:42;"I believe Steve Condoris did."
01:30:42;01:30:44;"That was our main outfit."
01:30:44;01:30:46;"But when I started looking through this folder,"
01:30:46;01:30:47;"it was like crazy."
01:30:47;01:30:50;"There was so much stuff, stuff that I even forgot about."
01:30:50;01:30:53;"So this is the earliest recording that I found in this folder."
01:30:53;01:30:55;"I must've given Andre this tape,"
01:30:55;01:30:57;"and he digitized it when we were teenagers."
01:30:57;01:30:59;"I may have mentioned this before."
01:30:59;01:31:02;"Like there was a kid who lived in my town named Simon Timoney."
01:31:02;01:31:03;"Great guy."
01:31:03;01:31:05;"We were like really tight friends,"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"and I've seen him once or twice in my adult life."
01:31:07;01:31:10;"And we were really tight when I think we were six or seven years old."
01:31:10;01:31:14;"So he moved to my town, and immediately we like loved each other."
01:31:14;01:31:15;"We hung out all the time."
01:31:15;01:31:17;"And then as I started to hang out with him,"
01:31:17;01:31:18;"I started to realize,"
01:31:18;01:31:19;"because I didn't know what any of this stuff was."
01:31:19;01:31:21;"I was the little kid that his family had all these connections"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"to pretty like out there stuff."
01:31:23;01:31:26;"Like I'm pretty sure his dad was a member of the band,"
01:31:26;01:31:27;"The Residents,"
01:31:27;01:31:29;"the kind of like where the eyeball heads,"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"like legendary avant-garde band."
01:31:31;01:31:35;"And his mom had something to do with Sonic Youth."
01:31:35;01:31:36;"I think I've told this story."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"Like I have a memory of being like eight maybe,"
01:31:38;01:31:41;"and rolling with Simon and his mom to Hoboken."
01:31:41;01:31:44;"And we went to Steve Shelley's apartment,"
01:31:44;01:31:45;"who's the drummer of Sonic Youth."
01:31:45;01:31:47;"And he was getting rid of old t-shirts."
01:31:47;01:31:48;"As I say it out loud, I'm just like,"
01:31:48;01:31:50;"it just seems like such a dream."
01:31:50;01:31:52;"But I was at Steve Shelley's apartment,"
01:31:52;01:31:55;"and he was getting rid of old t-shirts."
01:31:55;01:31:56;"'Cause for a long time,"
01:31:56;01:31:58;"I had this t-shirt that said MTV,"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"and then underneath Machine Gun TV."
01:32:00;01:32:02;"And I wore that for years."
01:32:02;01:32:03;"And I didn't realize later,"
01:32:03;01:32:04;"that was like a Japanese noise band."
01:32:04;01:32:06;"But so I was wearing that when I was like eight or nine,"
01:32:06;01:32:08;"just being like, check out my MTV shirt."
01:32:08;01:32:11;"But really it was a Japanese noise band t-shirt"
01:32:11;01:32:14;"that I had received at Steve Shelley's apartment."
01:32:14;01:32:16;"- In like '92."
01:32:16;01:32:17;"- Yes."
01:32:17;01:32:18;"- The year that Punk broke."
01:32:18;01:32:19;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:32:19;01:32:21;"- Okay, a lot of pedigree here."
01:32:21;01:32:22;"I'm loving this."
01:32:22;01:32:23;"- This is very interesting."
01:32:23;01:32:24;"- It was a very weird connection."
01:32:24;01:32:26;"And then also Simon knew Kurt."
01:32:26;01:32:27;"- Colbain."
01:32:27;01:32:29;"- Yeah, 'cause Simon had a band called the Stinky Puffs."
01:32:29;01:32:32;"And Kurt was like a fan."
01:32:32;01:32:33;"And then look--"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"- But Simon is roughly your age?"
01:32:35;01:32:36;"- Exactly my age."
01:32:36;01:32:38;"No, Simon was a little boy who made some recordings."
01:32:38;01:32:41;"And Kurt was like a fan."
01:32:41;01:32:42;"'Cause I kind of remember,"
01:32:42;01:32:44;"I didn't even know who Nirvana was at the time."
01:32:44;01:32:45;"And I kind of remember Simon being like,"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"I feel like I've heard of the Stinky Puffs."
01:32:47;01:32:48;"- Yeah, that was Simon's band."
01:32:48;01:32:49;"- Wow."
01:32:49;01:32:51;"- And it was like a little kid band."
01:32:51;01:32:54;"And he had recorded that when he used to live in San Francisco"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"and he lived in New Jersey for one year."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"- Do you think Steve Shelley passed the tape to Kurt Cobain?"
01:32:58;01:32:59;"- I don't know."
01:32:59;01:33:02;"Maybe Simon's mom knew all these people."
01:33:02;01:33:04;"- This is crazy."
01:33:04;01:33:05;"- Yeah, it was pretty wild."
01:33:05;01:33:06;"Because I kind of remember,"
01:33:06;01:33:08;"I actually have a memory of this,"
01:33:08;01:33:09;"being like eight and seven,"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"being like, do you know the band Nirvana?"
01:33:11;01:33:14;"And I was like, I've heard of the state Nirvana,"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"but I didn't mean the state of Nirvana."
01:33:16;01:33:17;"I meant Nevada."
01:33:17;01:33:19;"And there's a diner in New Jersey called Nevada Diner."
01:33:19;01:33:22;"I really, like, I was still so young"
01:33:22;01:33:23;"that I would hear somebody say Nirvana."
01:33:23;01:33:25;"I was like, oh yeah, I've heard of that,"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"that state out by California."
01:33:27;01:33:28;"- Oh man."
01:33:28;01:33:32;"- And he was like, yeah, it says my name in one of their CDs."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"And I was like, what?"
01:33:34;01:33:35;"And I was like, oh."
01:33:35;01:33:36;"But I was like a kid."
01:33:36;01:33:38;"None of this made any sense."
01:33:38;01:33:41;"Anyway, Simon's stepdad at the time,"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"or at least his mom's boyfriend,"
01:33:43;01:33:46;"was Jad Fair, who had the band Half Japanese."
01:33:46;01:33:47;"- Yeah."
01:33:47;01:33:48;"- Probably when I was 14 or 15,"
01:33:48;01:33:50;"I looked back on all this stuff and I was like, what?"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"- Wait, so his stepdad, you said?"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"- His stepdad was in the band Half Japanese."
01:33:54;01:33:55;"- And was Jad Fair."
01:33:55;01:33:56;"- Was Jad Fair."
01:33:56;01:33:58;"So for anybody, you know, Half Japanese is kind of like"
01:33:58;01:34:04;"starting in the '80s, kind of like an original lo-fi indie band."
01:34:04;01:34:07;"Like, I think it might've been two brothers."
01:34:07;01:34:10;"- Jad and David Fair."
01:34:10;01:34:11;"- Jad and David Fair."
01:34:11;01:34:12;"- Yeah."
01:34:12;01:34:14;"- You know, so Jad's like a legend."
01:34:17;01:34:20;"- Is this like a Matador thing?"
01:34:20;01:34:21;"- It's even before Matador."
01:34:22;01:34:23;"This is the '80s."
01:34:25;01:34:34;"- A little Jonathan Richman, a little Daniel Johnston kind of thing."
01:34:34;01:34:35;"- Yeah."
01:34:35;01:34:40;"- So Jad Fair was just living in Hoboken."
01:34:40;01:34:43;"- So that's what Half Japanese kind of sounds like."
01:34:43;01:34:44;"- But at the time--"
01:34:44;01:34:45;"- Great K Records."
01:34:45;01:34:48;"- Yeah, at the time, Simon and his mom were living in Glen Ridge."
01:34:48;01:34:50;"So maybe--I don't know what Jad Fair was doing."
01:34:50;01:34:51;"I feel like I only met him a couple times."
01:34:51;01:34:53;"- By the way, he formed in 1974."
01:34:53;01:34:54;"- Okay."
01:34:54;01:34:55;"- Wow."
01:34:55;01:34:56;"- Half Japanese."
01:34:56;01:34:57;"- Yeah."
01:34:57;01:34:59;"- So Jad Fair's this kind of like indie legend,"
01:34:59;01:35:02;"but I have this recording that I found in this folder,"
01:35:02;01:35:03;"which I vaguely remember."
01:35:03;01:35:05;"I don't know what the story was."
01:35:05;01:35:07;"Maybe Jad Fair was just dating Simon's mom or something"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"because I remember he wasn't around that much."
01:35:09;01:35:10;"Like, maybe he was on tour."
01:35:10;01:35:14;"He came back from tour for all--I don't know if they were married"
01:35:14;01:35:15;"or it was his girlfriend."
01:35:15;01:35:16;"Whatever."
01:35:16;01:35:19;"He's like seeing his current person."
01:35:19;01:35:22;"You totally picture it, and she's got like a seven, eight-year-old son."
01:35:22;01:35:23;"You like come back."
01:35:23;01:35:24;"You're like burned out, and she's like,"
01:35:24;01:35:27;"""Oh, Simon's friend's sleeping over,"" and you're like,"
01:35:27;01:35:28;"""Okay, what's up?"""
01:35:28;01:35:32;"So anyway, I have very little memory of like interacting with him,"
01:35:32;01:35:36;"but at some point he brought home a drum machine,"
01:35:36;01:35:41;"and I guess just to do something fun with his girlfriend's son,"
01:35:41;01:35:44;"stepson, and his little friend, he busted out the drum machine"
01:35:44;01:35:48;"and made a tape of us just kind of like singing and rapping over it."
01:35:48;01:35:51;"So I have this like 25-minute MP3."
01:35:51;01:35:54;"I found some--so this is Jad Fair--"
01:35:54;01:35:56;"- Is there a date on there?"
01:35:56;01:35:57;"92, 93."
01:35:57;01:36:00;"- I'm saying it's 90--I'm saying 92, 93."
01:36:00;01:36:03;"[rap music]"
01:36:03;01:36:04;"That's me rapping."
01:36:04;01:36:05;"Let me see what's good."
01:36:05;01:36:06;"So this is just like--"
01:36:06;01:36:07;"- So you're like eight or nine."
01:36:07;01:36:10;"- Yeah, Jad Fair just like cycling through beats on this drum machine"
01:36:10;01:36:13;"and then me and Simon just like taking turns."
01:36:13;01:36:15;"[rap music]"
01:36:15;01:36:16;"[laughs]"
01:36:16;01:36:21;"[rap music]"
01:36:21;01:36:22;"- Snickers."
01:36:22;01:36:23;"- Ha!"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"[rap music]"
01:36:25;01:36:26;"- Candy canes."
01:36:26;01:36:29;"[rap music]"
01:36:29;01:36:43;"[rap music]"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"- So I'm just like--I wonder how old--"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"how old was Jad Fair in 1992?"
01:36:47;01:36:51;"[rap music]"
01:36:51;01:36:52;"This is sick."
01:36:52;01:36:53;"[laughs]"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"[rap music]"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"He was born in '54."
01:36:57;01:37:00;"So he was 38."
01:37:00;01:37:01;"- 38."
01:37:01;01:37:03;"- He's like my age now."
01:37:03;01:37:05;"Yeah, I'm saying like, ""Oh, I don't think I did it."
01:37:05;01:37:06;"I messed up."""
01:37:06;01:37:07;"- Yeah, I'm gonna write it down."
01:37:07;01:37:10;"- Oh, yeah, I gotta write them down."
01:37:10;01:37:12;"I just want to do a better job."
01:37:12;01:37:13;"[rap music]"
01:37:13;01:37:14;"[laughs]"
01:37:14;01:37:26;"[rap music]"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"- Almond Roka."
01:37:28;01:37:29;"[laughs]"
01:37:29;01:37:33;"[rap music]"
01:37:33;01:37:34;"[laughs]"
01:37:34;01:37:37;"[rap music]"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"- Almond Roka is a very specific--"
01:37:39;01:37:40;"- I know."
01:37:40;01:37:41;"I wonder where I had that."
01:37:41;01:37:42;"- [laughs]"
01:37:42;01:37:43;"- Almond Roka."
01:37:43;01:37:45;"So, yeah, I haven't even listened to the whole thing."
01:37:45;01:37:46;"- Wow."
01:37:46;01:37:47;"- I clicked around, and there's like--"
01:37:47;01:37:48;"- Wow."
01:37:48;01:37:49;"- There's some moments."
01:37:49;01:37:51;"- Almond Roka's been discontinued."
01:37:51;01:37:52;"- Oh."
01:37:52;01:37:53;"- Bummer."
01:37:53;01:37:54;"- R.I.P."
01:37:54;01:38:08;"[rap music]"
01:38:08;01:38:10;"- That's such a kid thing."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"Subterfuge has two times."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"- Counting."
01:38:12;01:38:13;"- Yeah."
01:38:13;01:38:18;"[rap music]"
01:38:18;01:38:20;"- We're, like, whispering to each other."
01:38:20;01:38:23;"Anyway, so this is some of my earliest recording."
01:38:23;01:38:24;"- Wow."
01:38:24;01:38:26;"So where's Simon on this?"
01:38:26;01:38:49;"[rap music]"
01:38:49;01:38:50;"[laughs]"
01:38:50;01:39:00;"[rap music]"
01:39:00;01:39:02;"- That's some strong Joe from Simon."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"He said, ""Simon is my name."
01:39:04;01:39:06;"There's a band called Simon and Garfunkel."
01:39:06;01:39:08;"I wish it was called Simon and Barfunkel."
01:39:08;01:39:10;"Then it might gross people out."""
01:39:10;01:39:12;"So that's, like, some--"
01:39:12;01:39:13;"- Simon and Barfunkel."
01:39:13;01:39:14;"- Barfunkel."
01:39:14;01:39:15;"[laughs]"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"Some very early material."
01:39:17;01:39:18;"- Pretty garbage-bill kids."
01:39:18;01:39:19;"- That's a great T-shirt."
01:39:19;01:39:21;"- ""Simon's got to make Simon and Barfunkel."""
01:39:21;01:39:23;"- And then somewhere--"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"Yes, so anyway, so that's very early material."
01:39:25;01:39:27;"And then I would start to make songs."
01:39:27;01:39:28;"I had, like, a tape recorder."
01:39:28;01:39:30;"I don't know if any of those are digitized."
01:39:30;01:39:33;"Write some of my earliest songs, just, like, solo on the piano."
01:39:33;01:39:34;"I probably mentioned, like--"
01:39:34;01:39:35;"I always thought the first song I wrote"
01:39:35;01:39:37;"was this one called ""Bad Birthday Party."""
01:39:37;01:39:39;"It's also kind of, like, a '50s song."
01:39:39;01:39:40;"- So is this, like, middle school?"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"- Yeah, that's probably being, like, 10 or 11."
01:39:42;01:39:43;"- Wow."
01:39:43;01:39:46;"- But then, you know, about 7th grade, 13,"
01:39:46;01:39:48;"that's when we started having, like, bats."
01:39:48;01:39:49;"- Right."
01:39:49;01:39:50;"- You know, go over to Wes's house and, like,"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"""Oh, you can play-- I have a guitar."""
01:39:52;01:39:53;"You know, that's--"
01:39:53;01:39:56;"So we started having bands who did, like, covers."
01:39:56;01:39:58;"I remember we, uh--"
01:39:58;01:39:59;"We played--"
01:39:59;01:40:02;"I think we played at our 7th grade graduation."
01:40:02;01:40:04;"There's no recordings of this, I don't think."
01:40:04;01:40:06;"But, you know, we did one original,"
01:40:06;01:40:08;"a song that I wrote called ""The Beast from the Sea."""
01:40:08;01:40:10;"And then we did one by U2."
01:40:10;01:40:12;"Wes's brother was a huge U2 fan."
01:40:12;01:40:15;"And maybe we did, like, ""Sunshine of Your Love."""
01:40:15;01:40:16;"- Oh, sick. - Super rad."
01:40:16;01:40:18;"- Middle schoolers doing ""Sunshine of Your Love"" is--"
01:40:18;01:40:19;"- [hums]"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"- One of the most timeless things."
01:40:21;01:40:23;"- Oh, yeah, one more, like, funny pit stop"
01:40:23;01:40:27;"before we get to, like, the real band is that--"
01:40:27;01:40:28;"So then we're in high school,"
01:40:28;01:40:29;"and we had this older friend"
01:40:29;01:40:32;"who's actually been on the show back in the day, Raj."
01:40:32;01:40:35;"And Raj was a great drummer and DJ,"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"and we were kind of, like, the younger kids."
01:40:37;01:40:39;"He wanted to start an acid jazz band."
01:40:39;01:40:43;"So he got all these people who were in, like, the school band."
01:40:43;01:40:45;"- How old was Raj at this point?"
01:40:45;01:40:46;"- So Raj was, like, a senior,"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"so he might have been 17 or 18."
01:40:48;01:40:49;"- Okay."
01:40:49;01:40:51;"- And let's say we're, like, 14, 15."
01:40:51;01:40:52;"So then I found, like, there's a show"
01:40:52;01:40:54;"of us playing live on the street"
01:40:54;01:40:58;"playing a Greyboy All-Stars song called ""Happy Friends."""
01:40:58;01:41:00;"- That one's called ""Hot Dog."""
01:41:00;01:41:02;"- So this was, like, '98?"
01:41:02;01:41:03;"- This is..."
01:41:03;01:41:04;"- All right, we're gonna keep it moving"
01:41:04;01:41:05;"with the Boogaloo jazz."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"- Realistically, spring '99."
01:41:07;01:41:10;"- This one's called ""West Coast Boogaloo."""
01:41:10;01:41:12;"- Yeah."
01:41:14;01:41:15;"- And what are you playing?"
01:41:15;01:41:16;"- Saxophone."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"- Oh, okay."
01:41:17;01:41:19;"- I probably just turned 15."
01:41:19;01:41:20;"I could have been 14."
01:41:20;01:41:21;"It's right around--"
01:41:21;01:41:23;"- Is this at, like, a farmer's market or something?"
01:41:23;01:41:24;"- It's on the street."
01:41:24;01:41:25;"- Here we go."
01:41:25;01:41:26;"- Church Street in Montclair."
01:41:26;01:41:29;"- Did you get, like, a full permit, or did you just set up?"
01:41:29;01:41:31;"- No, we just set up, and I think there's a health food store"
01:41:31;01:41:33;"run by these kind of older hippie dudes,"
01:41:33;01:41:35;"and they would let us, like, run some power."
01:41:35;01:41:37;"- Uh-huh."
01:41:37;01:41:38;"- This one's sick."
01:41:38;01:41:40;"- Yeah, you guys sound pretty tight."
01:41:40;01:41:41;"- Who's playing drums?"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"- Who's the other saxophone player?"
01:41:42;01:41:43;"- That's Raj on drums."
01:41:43;01:41:44;"- Oh, wow."
01:41:44;01:41:45;"- No, it's me and Wes."
01:41:45;01:41:46;"Wes played tenor, and I played alto."
01:41:46;01:41:48;"- You guys sound great."
01:41:48;01:41:51;"- Wait, check this out."
01:41:51;01:41:53;"And then, like, later, Raj, who's the band leader,"
01:41:53;01:41:56;"he would just, like, call out, ""Time for solos."""
01:41:56;01:42:02;"- Are you reading off a chart?"
01:42:02;01:42:03;"- A little pitchy."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"We might have written it down."
01:42:05;01:42:06;"This is my solo."
01:42:07;01:42:10;"[saxophone solo]"
01:42:10;01:42:14;"- Damn, son."
01:42:14;01:42:16;"- Harmelodics, man."
01:42:16;01:42:18;"- Unfortunately, I never advanced past this,"
01:42:18;01:42:21;"but actually, I do--I want to play the saxophone more."
01:42:21;01:42:22;"I miss."
01:42:22;01:42:25;"- Dude, that'd be sick if you did a sax solo to a BW show."
01:42:25;01:42:27;"- I've always wanted to."
01:42:27;01:42:34;"- Who were your main influences as a sax player?"
01:42:34;01:42:36;"- Well, I remember the jazz band teacher"
01:42:36;01:42:37;"gave me an Eric Dolphy CD,"
01:42:37;01:42:39;"and he said, ""You should listen to Eric Dolphy."""
01:42:39;01:42:41;"- I get a little bit."
01:42:41;01:42:43;"It's like a later--it's not cool."
01:42:43;01:42:45;"It's not like..."
01:42:45;01:42:46;"""Gets,"" Dan Gets."
01:42:46;01:42:47;"- No, no, no."
01:42:47;01:42:48;"- It's like..."
01:42:48;01:42:49;"- Bebop."
01:42:49;01:42:50;"Goin' hard."
01:42:50;01:42:51;"- Bebop, dude."
01:42:51;01:42:53;"- Wes taking a tenor solo."
01:42:53;01:42:58;"Yeah, I mean, I think the sad truth is"
01:42:58;01:43:00;"I'll never be able to fully express myself"
01:43:00;01:43:03;"on guitar improvisationally."
01:43:03;01:43:06;"But maybe with some practice, I could on sax."
01:43:06;01:43:07;"- Dude, get back out there."
01:43:07;01:43:09;"- I'm gonna get back on it."
01:43:09;01:43:12;"- What song would be good to solo over"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"in the Vampire Weekend catalog?"
01:43:14;01:43:16;"- I mean, a lot of them on sax."
01:43:16;01:43:21;"- 2021."
01:43:21;01:43:22;"- 2021?"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"8-minute Cape Cod, man."
01:43:24;01:43:25;"- Yeah, I was gonna say."
01:43:25;01:43:26;"Cape Cod."
01:43:26;01:43:27;"- Wearin' it right now."
01:43:27;01:43:28;"- Oh, yeah."
01:43:28;01:43:30;"- So anyway, these were--"
01:43:30;01:43:32;"that's some of the real early work."
01:43:32;01:43:35;"And then we started this band called The Sophisticus"
01:43:35;01:43:38;"who released multiple albums."
01:43:38;01:43:40;"- When you say ""released,"" what do you mean?"
01:43:40;01:43:43;"- We would burn, like, 20 to 30 copies."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"And sometimes we would sell them at the shows."
01:43:45;01:43:48;"And they all had an aesthetic."
01:43:48;01:43:49;"They would always be, like, white covers"
01:43:49;01:43:51;"with, like, really simple text."
01:43:51;01:43:52;"So we made--"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"- I'm getting, like, stencil."
01:43:54;01:43:55;"- It's a little bit like that."
01:43:55;01:43:57;"We just, like, print it out on--"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"- And wait, so, like, what year is this?"
01:43:59;01:44:02;"- So now we're talking, like, 2000."
01:44:02;01:44:04;"And I vividly--this is also around the time"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"that Wes's family got some, like,"
01:44:06;01:44:09;"solid recording gear in their basement."
01:44:09;01:44:10;"They had an ADAT machine,"
01:44:10;01:44:12;"which is the first thing we recorded on."
01:44:12;01:44:13;"And then at some point,"
01:44:13;01:44:15;"they got an early version of Pro Tools."
01:44:15;01:44:16;"And then suddenly we were just, like,"
01:44:16;01:44:18;"recording a lot and playing shows."
01:44:18;01:44:20;"But it's funny. It's, like--"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"I mean, yeah, this stuff is--"
01:44:22;01:44:25;"so just, like, dozens and dozens of songs."
01:44:25;01:44:27;"But they're very, like--it's weird."
01:44:27;01:44:29;"Like, when I heard your guys' songs,"
01:44:29;01:44:31;"I was very impressed because--"
01:44:31;01:44:32;"- What--yeah."
01:44:32;01:44:33;"- I mean, I guess it makes sense."
01:44:33;01:44:35;"Maybe when I was 19, I was starting to write, like,"
01:44:35;01:44:36;"proper songs with, like, lyrics."
01:44:36;01:44:38;"But definitely when I was, like,"
01:44:38;01:44:40;"the age you were doing ""Cartesian Divers,"""
01:44:40;01:44:41;"the idea of just, like, sitting down"
01:44:41;01:44:43;"and writing, like, a full song that said something,"
01:44:43;01:44:45;"it just wasn't possible."
01:44:45;01:44:47;"Luckily, I didn't care because I didn't--"
01:44:47;01:44:48;"even though I should have been,"
01:44:48;01:44:49;"I wasn't embarrassed by it."
01:44:49;01:44:50;"So we would play shows."
01:44:50;01:44:52;"I'd just make up the words the whole time."
01:44:52;01:44:53;"And, like, even on the recordings--"
01:44:53;01:44:54;"- Solid."
01:44:54;01:44:57;"- The songs barely have any--"
01:44:57;01:45:00;"- I mean, if you know what I mean,"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"and I mean what I say, I mean--"
01:45:02;01:45:03;"- Follow me down the garden path."
01:45:03;01:45:06;"- I didn't start caring about lyrics until I was, like, 40."
01:45:06;01:45:07;"So--"
01:45:07;01:45:08;"[laughter]"
01:45:08;01:45:09;"- Until ""Mountain Bruce."""
01:45:09;01:45:10;"- Pretty much."
01:45:10;01:45:12;"- I mean--all right, let me see what some, like--"
01:45:12;01:45:15;"and it's funny because as I went through all these songs,"
01:45:15;01:45:18;"I could really hear, like, our kind of development."
01:45:18;01:45:19;"Here's the thing."
01:45:19;01:45:21;"My embarrassment of these recordings"
01:45:21;01:45:22;"is not that they're sloppy,"
01:45:22;01:45:23;"and it's not even the songwriting."
01:45:23;01:45:25;"It's my voice is what it's hard to hear."
01:45:25;01:45:27;"- Hard relate on that, dude."
01:45:27;01:45:30;"- Like--and then it's funny."
01:45:30;01:45:33;"I can see how we got a little more sophisticated"
01:45:33;01:45:35;"as time went on."
01:45:35;01:45:36;"Let me see."
01:45:36;01:45:40;"- By 2000, ""American People"" was over."
01:45:40;01:45:41;"- Yeah."
01:45:41;01:45:42;"""American People"" is done."
01:45:42;01:45:45;"- But we made, like, six, five albums."
01:45:45;01:45:46;"- Yeah. - Whoa, that's a lot."
01:45:46;01:45:48;"- EPs, yeah."
01:45:48;01:45:51;"From, like, '96 to '98, I think, was the run of AP."
01:45:51;01:45:55;"In '98, I was sort of like, ""Eh, I'm not that good at music."

01:45:57;01:45:59;"and maybe play guitar in my friends' bands."""
