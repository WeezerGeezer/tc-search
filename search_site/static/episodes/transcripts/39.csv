00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, late March."
00:04;00:08;"We'll be talking to Lush Life, my old friend."
00:08;00:13;"Plus, Jonathan Wolfe, composer of the Seinfeld theme song."
00:13;00:19;"All this, plus we count down the hits of 1989 and today."
00:19;00:23;"It's almost spring, and this is..."
00:23;00:27;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:27;00:31;"B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-spot one."
00:31;00:37;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:37;00:44;"The war I felt, wobbly me, all my rightful chances."
00:44;00:52;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:52;00:59;"And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go."
00:59;01:03;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:03;01:09;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:09;01:14;"Leave a lonely man."
01:14;01:16;"Time Crisis, we're back."
01:16;01:17;"What's up, Jake?"
01:17;01:18;"Hey."
01:18;01:19;"How you doing, man?"
01:19;01:20;"Pretty good."
01:20;01:22;"Did you listen to the new Drake playlist?"
01:22;01:23;"No."
01:23;01:24;"Do you care about Drake?"
01:24;01:26;"No, I mean, I'm fine with them, but I don't--"
01:26;01:27;"You respect Drake?"
01:27;01:28;"Yeah, sure."
01:28;01:33;"But so when a new Drake album or playlist comes out,"
01:33;01:34;"you're not rushing to listen to it?"
01:34;01:36;"Didn't even hear about it."
01:36;01:37;"You didn't know that he dropped a new playlist?"
01:37;01:39;"How would I know about that?"
01:39;01:40;"Where do you first see that?"
01:40;01:42;"Where do I first see that?"
01:42;01:47;"Something like that I'd probably first see on social media."
01:47;01:48;"Okay, so you're on Twitter."
01:48;01:49;"You wake up--"
01:49;01:51;"I don't check Twitter every day, but--"
01:51;01:52;"Really?"
01:52;01:53;"Yeah, no."
01:53;01:54;"I find that shocking."
01:54;01:55;"I've been weaning myself off."
01:55;01:56;"It's toxic right now."
01:56;01:57;"It's brutal."
01:57;01:58;"Nobody needs to check Twitter every day."
01:58;02:00;"But I think somebody just told me,"
02:00;02:01;"""Oh, the new Drake thing is out."""
02:01;02:03;"So like a friend texted you?"
02:03;02:04;"Yeah."
02:04;02:05;"Was like, ""Oh, did you hear that?"""
02:05;02:07;"Yeah, because there's a lot of people that I know"
02:07;02:11;"who would be like, ""What do you think of the new Drake?"""
02:11;02:13;"I need an answer."
02:13;02:15;"But Drake made-- it's not an album, it's a playlist."
02:15;02:17;"Kind of like my Home Depot playlist?"
02:17;02:19;"Well, it's all original music."
02:19;02:20;"Oh."
02:20;02:22;"It's presented as a playlist."
02:22;02:23;"Is it a little more casual than--"
02:23;02:24;"Yeah, maybe it's a little more casual."
02:24;02:26;"There's some like fun moments where people are just talking."
02:26;02:28;"It's like a lateral move from a mixtape?"
02:28;02:30;"That's a good way to look at it."
02:30;02:34;"But everybody was talking about it when it came out last week."
02:34;02:35;"Haven't heard it."
02:35;02:36;"You haven't heard any of it?"
02:36;02:37;"Nope."
02:37;02:39;"I mentioned to you that there was a reference on it."
02:39;02:42;"So this is a song called ""Lose You."""
02:42;02:44;"I don't care what society thinks."
02:44;02:45;"They're nothing anyway."
02:45;02:47;"They're no better than me."
02:47;02:49;"You just have to fit into a pattern."
02:49;02:50;"If somebody's on a hit, I'm for you."
02:50;02:52;"The life we live, you have to set your own patterns,"
02:52;02:53;"your own ideals."
02:53;02:55;"You have to handle the whole job yourself."
02:55;02:57;"Yeah."
02:57;03:00;"That's a Canadian biker speaking."
03:00;03:01;"Like bicyclist?"
03:01;03:04;"No, like a Hells Angel type."
03:04;03:05;"Oh, like a--"
03:05;03:07;"[MUSIC - DRAKE, ""LOSE YOU""]"
03:07;03:09;"Oh, you get the idea of the vibe of the song."
03:09;03:11;"There's a specific line I wanted you to hear."
03:11;03:13;"[MUSIC - DRAKE, ""LOSE YOU""]"
03:13;03:16;"Drake often has songs like this on his albums,"
03:16;03:19;"mixtapes, whatever, that's kind of like where he's"
03:19;03:20;"kind of in a reflective mode."
03:20;03:23;"And he's kind of thinking about how he can't trust anybody,"
03:23;03:25;"and how there's so many fake people,"
03:25;03:29;"and how the more famous and rich you get, you get new problems."
03:29;03:31;"He always has these songs where he's kind of like--"
03:31;03:33;"Did he do ""Straight to my face?"""
03:33;03:34;"Is that Drake?"
03:34;03:35;"""Straight up to my face?"""
03:35;03:37;"Yeah, about people who lie to you."
03:37;03:40;"So he's really on that Bob Dylan, Positively 4th Street"
03:40;03:41;"tip."
03:41;03:43;"He loves that mode."
03:43;03:47;"Of just being like, yeah, all the fake people who you just"
03:47;03:49;"want to be on the side that's winning."
03:49;03:50;"Yeah."
03:50;03:51;"So--"
03:51;03:53;"When I was down, you just stood there grinning."
03:53;03:58;"And it's kind of like, oh, you liked me when I was starting."
03:58;04:00;"People don't like you once you've made it."
04:00;04:01;"[MUSIC - DRAKE, ""LOSE YOU""]"
04:01;04:03;"Be honest with myself and take ownership."
04:03;04:05;"Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn."
04:05;04:07;"I really used to feel like they loved the [BLEEP]"
04:07;04:08;"at first."
04:08;04:11;"Exciting times revitalized, trust this little light of mine."
04:11;04:13;"It's going to shine positively."
04:13;04:14;"But listen to this."
04:14;04:17;"I'm mistaken, but God will give me."
04:17;04:19;"Grateful like Jerry, Bob, and Mickey."
04:19;04:21;"Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me."
04:21;04:22;"I did."
04:22;04:23;"Rewind."
04:23;04:25;"What did you say, Drake?"
04:25;04:27;"Grateful like Jerry, Bob, and Mickey."
04:27;04:29;"Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me."
04:29;04:31;"I don't catch in flies and honey, it's still sticky."
04:31;04:32;"I wrote the book--"
04:32;04:33;"Jerry, Bob, and Mickey."
04:33;04:37;"So to anybody at home who doesn't know what Drake means"
04:37;04:41;"when he says that he's grateful like Jerry, Bob, and Mickey,"
04:41;04:43;"he's referencing the Grateful Dead, one of Jake's"
04:43;04:44;"all-time favorite bands."
04:44;04:47;"He rhymes Mickey with give me."
04:47;04:49;"No, well, he-- no, then he says sticky."
04:49;04:50;"Listen to the whole line."
04:50;04:51;"Oh, wait."
04:51;04:52;"Grateful like Jerry, Bob, and Mickey."
04:52;04:54;"Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me."
04:54;04:56;"I don't catch in flies and honey, it's still sticky."
04:56;04:57;"OK."
04:57;04:58;"No, is that--"
04:58;04:59;"That's a good point."
04:59;05:02;"Is that a reference to the Grateful Dead honey bear?"
05:02;05:04;"You know, one of their logos is like the bear?"
05:04;05:05;"I don't think so."
05:05;05:06;"[LAUGHS]"
05:06;05:08;"But anyway, the main thing I want to talk about"
05:08;05:11;"is I feel like the Grateful Dead doesn't get a ton of shout outs"
05:11;05:17;"in modern pop music, let alone name-checking three members."
05:17;05:21;"Like, first of all, Jerry Garcia is an icon, very famous."
05:21;05:23;"Bob Weir, to a lesser extent."
05:23;05:24;"Mickey, that's deep."
05:24;05:25;"Mickey Hart."
05:25;05:27;"Mickey Hart is the drummer."
05:27;05:28;"Second drummer."
05:28;05:29;"Second drummer in the Dead."
05:29;05:32;"You know, I'm sure Drake chose it for the rhyme"
05:32;05:33;"because Mickey rhymes with sticky."
05:33;05:34;"Yeah."
05:34;05:39;"The one tough thing about this is that as much as I'm sure"
05:39;05:41;"the living members of the Grateful Dead"
05:41;05:44;"appreciate the shout out, perhaps just due"
05:44;05:49;"to syllabic constraints, Drake did not shout out"
05:49;05:50;"every member of the band."
05:50;05:52;"Didn't shout out Phil Lesh."
05:52;05:54;"And he specifically didn't shout out Phil Lesh,"
05:54;05:55;"who's the bassist."
05:55;06:01;"Kind of like the sweet-natured, often forgotten bassist."
06:01;06:04;"Doesn't have the flash of the Jerry, Bob, or Mickey."
06:04;06:05;"Iconic in his own right."
06:06;06:09;"So, you know, just imagine that you're Phil Lesh's"
06:09;06:13;"grandchildren, and you hear that your grandpa's band"
06:13;06:15;"got shouted out on a Drake song."
06:15;06:16;"I think that's pretty cool."
06:16;06:20;"And you're like, Grandpa Phil, the biggest rapper in the world,"
06:20;06:23;"just shouted out Grateful Dead on his new playlist."
06:23;06:24;"And Phil Lesh's like, oh, I didn't know Drake"
06:24;06:25;"had a new playlist."
06:25;06:26;"That's pretty cool."
06:26;06:28;"He's like, what is a playlist?"
06:28;06:31;"No, I think Phil Lesh is up on that."
06:31;06:32;"Oh, that's interesting."
06:32;06:34;"Drake's always having fun with the album form."
06:34;06:35;"What did he say?"
06:35;06:39;"And they said, well, he said he's grateful,"
06:39;06:41;"like Jerry, Bob, and Mickey."
06:41;06:45;"And Phil Lesh says, hmm, okay."
06:45;06:48;"Mickey wasn't even a founding member."
06:48;06:50;"Well, that's great, guys."
06:50;06:54;"Couldn't he have gone grateful like Jerry, Bob, Phil, and Mickey?"
06:54;06:55;"Just cram it in."
06:55;06:57;"I'm just taking what God will give me."
06:57;06:59;"Grateful like Jerry, Bob, and Mickey."
06:59;07:02;"Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me."
07:02;07:04;"I know catching flies with honey is still sticky."
07:04;07:07;"I wrote the book on world-class finesses and tasteful gestures"
07:07;07:09;"and making efforts and never placing second."
07:09;07:12;"Even better, knowing you first, but then taking second."
07:12;07:14;"Inspiring and never taking credit."
07:14;07:15;"I know I deserve more."
07:15;07:16;"I just never said it."
07:16;07:19;"Two middle fingers as I make an exit."
07:19;07:20;"Yeah."
07:20;07:23;"Did I lose you?"
07:23;07:24;"Did I?"
07:25;07:28;"Did I lose you?"
07:28;07:29;"Did I?"
07:30;07:32;"Did I lose you?"
07:35;07:43;"Winning is problematic."
07:43;07:46;"People like you more when you working towards something,"
07:46;07:47;"not when you have it."
07:47;07:49;"Way less support from my peers in recent years"
07:49;07:51;"as I get established."
07:51;07:53;"Unforgiving times, but I manage."
07:53;07:55;"Why is my struggle different than others?"
07:55;07:58;"Only child is taking care of his mother."
07:58;08:00;"His health worsens, his bills double."
08:00;08:01;"That's not respectable."
08:01;08:04;"All of a sudden, I don't get a pat on the back for the come up."
08:04;08:06;"What do you see when you see me?"
08:06;08:09;"When did all the things I mean from the bottom of my heart"
08:09;08:10;"start to lose meaning?"
08:10;08:12;"Maybe I shared with too many people."
08:12;08:15;"Back then, the usages feel like our secret."
08:15;08:17;"Back when I would write and not think about how to receive it,"
08:17;08:21;"I'd be trying to manifest the things I needed."
08:21;08:24;"And look now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me."
08:24;08:29;"But you're mindful of it all when you're mindful of it all."
08:29;08:31;"How'd it go from not wanting me at all"
08:31;08:34;"to wanting to see me lose it all?"
08:34;08:36;"Things get dark when my heart just starts glowing."
08:36;08:39;"I'm overcome with emotions, ones I can't access"
08:39;08:40;"when I'm stone sober."
08:40;08:43;"Jealous ones still envy and turn King Cobra."
08:43;08:45;"I could only speak what I know."
08:45;08:47;"Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinking"
08:47;08:49;"and Icy Hanna can drink it."
08:49;08:52;"And rival neighborhoods linking and putting your trust"
08:52;08:55;"in someone with the risk of financially sinking."
08:55;08:58;"All you did was write the book on garbage-ass rollies,"
08:58;09:00;"ego stroking, picture posting."
09:00;09:03;"Claiming that you do it for motivational purposes only,"
09:03;09:05;"but you just had to show me."
09:05;09:08;"See, I know 'cause I study you closely."
09:08;09:10;"I know when someone lying."
09:10;09:12;"I know there's people standing for nothing or getting tired."
09:12;09:15;"I know what we're both thinking even when you're quiet."
09:15;09:18;"Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you."
09:18;09:21;"Did I?"
09:21;09:22;"Did I?"
09:22;09:25;"Did I lose you?"
09:25;09:26;"Did I?"
09:26;09:28;"Did I?"
09:28;09:30;"Did I lose you?"
09:30;09:36;"Wait, is Phil the only person that he's really passing over here?"
09:36;09:38;"Well, no. There's Pigpen."
09:38;09:39;"There's Pigpen."
09:39;09:40;"R.I.P. He died in like 1970."
09:40;09:41;"He died early."
09:41;09:45;"And then there's Keith Godchow, who replaced Pigpen."
09:45;09:46;"But he's kind of like a touring member?"
09:46;09:49;"Yeah, I mean, he was probably in the mid-'70s records."
09:49;09:52;"Well, that's not fair either, but definitely the most egregious."
09:52;09:54;"Donna Godchow as well."
09:54;09:55;"Oh, his wife?"
09:55;09:56;"Yeah."
09:56;09:57;"She play a little fiddle too?"
09:57;09:58;"No, I think just vocals."
09:58;09:59;"Oh, I'm thinking somebody else."
09:59;10:01;"But Phil is definitely the most egregious omission here."
10:01;10:02;"Yeah."
10:02;10:05;"Mickey Hart, interesting story."
10:05;10:07;"One of their great songs is called ""He's Gone."""
10:07;10:08;"Mm-hmm."
10:08;10:10;"It's on Europe 72."
10:10;10:13;"But anyway, that's about Mickey Hart's dad who was managing the dead."
10:13;10:14;"Oh, and ripping them off?"
10:14;10:18;"And then stole a bunch of their money and then absconded."
10:18;10:22;"Just vaporized, left, and then so they wrote ""He's Gone"" about it."
10:22;10:28;"It's one thing to steal money, but to abscond with it is--"
10:28;10:29;"that's hitting somebody one day."
10:29;10:31;"And I think-- I could be getting this wrong,"
10:31;10:34;"but I feel like the vibe was so bad after that"
10:34;10:36;"that they kicked Mickey Hart out"
10:36;10:40;"because Bill Kreutzman is the only drummer on the Europe 72 album."
10:40;10:44;"But then Mickey Hart came back mid-'70s."
10:44;10:47;"I think for a while they had to just be like, ""Dude, your dad ripped us off."
10:47;10:49;"You're not going on this tour."""
10:49;10:51;"That's a tough position to be in if your dad ripped off the band."
10:51;10:52;"Can you imagine?"
10:52;10:53;"That's rough."
10:53;10:57;"Also, I got to say, I wish there were tapes of them talking about that"
10:57;10:59;"because it must be hilarious."
10:59;11:02;"Because that must just be some straight-up Big Lebowski sh--"
11:02;11:08;"is a bunch of zonked-out hippies talking about financial matters."
11:08;11:10;"That is always funny."
11:10;11:11;"Oh my God."
11:11;11:17;"Just kind of like, ""Mickey, man, your dad made off with the bread, man."
11:17;11:19;"You know, we were out there touring, man."
11:19;11:25;"And yeah, your dad took the bread and he absconded, man."
11:25;11:29;"He absconded with the bread, man."
11:29;11:31;"Bob, am I wrong here?"
11:31;11:36;"No, Jerry, that's a real harsh move your dad pulled, man."
11:36;11:37;"That's not cool."""
11:37;11:38;"That's a real harsh toke."
11:38;11:42;"That's a real harsh toke, Mickey."
11:42;11:49;"And like, ""I don't know if I'm comfortable with the son of a bread absconder"
11:49;11:53;"keeping time behind me, man."""
11:53;11:57;"We just got to move forward here, guys."
11:57;11:59;"We got to."
11:59;12:01;"What's done is done."
12:01;12:03;"Yeah."
12:03;12:08;"Water under the bridge, man, but that's not cool."
12:08;12:12;"That's a harsh toke on the bong of existence."
12:12;12:14;"They got it together."
12:21;12:25;"You know better but I know him"
12:25;12:37;"Like I told you, what I said"
12:37;12:43;"Steal your face right off your head"
12:48;12:53;"Now he's gone"
12:53;13:00;"Now he's gone"
13:00;13:04;"But he's gone"
13:04;13:07;"He's gone"
13:07;13:16;"Like a steam locomotive"
13:16;13:19;"Running down the track"
13:19;13:21;"He's gone"
13:23;13:26;"But he's gonna bring him back"
13:26;13:30;"He's gone"
13:30;13:33;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
13:33;13:36;"Well, anyway, that's quite a start to the show."
13:36;13:38;"We already talked about Drake and the Grateful Dead."
13:38;13:41;"We got a big one coming up, Jake."
13:41;13:45;"We have two guests today calling in."
13:45;13:47;"We're going to be talking about Ed Sheeran."
13:47;13:50;"We're going to be talking about Mike Sheeran."
13:50;13:52;"The Ed Sheeran news just doesn't stop."
13:52;13:53;"Oh, there's news?"
13:53;13:54;"Oh, yeah, there's news."
13:54;13:55;"We'll get into that a little bit later."
13:55;13:57;"But the two guests we have today,"
13:57;13:59;"one is my buddy Raj,"
13:59;14:02;"also professionally known as the rapper Lush Life,"
14:02;14:03;"who I grew up with."
14:03;14:07;"He wrote a great moving op-ed for the Washington Post recently"
14:07;14:09;"about the violence against South Asians"
14:09;14:10;"that's been happening in America."
14:10;14:12;"So he's going to call in, going to catch up and talk."
14:12;14:14;"And then on a lighter note,"
14:14;14:16;"we also have Jonathan Wolfe,"
14:16;14:18;"the composer of the Seinfeld theme."
14:18;14:21;"We've really gotten some, like, top-shelf guests."
14:21;14:22;"That's big, man."
14:22;14:23;"Yeah, I know."
14:23;14:25;"[imitates guitar]"
14:25;14:26;"I just want to point out, you know,"
14:26;14:28;"when Sound Crisis first started,"
14:28;14:31;"I'll admit we had some real top-shelf guests."
14:31;14:33;"We had stars of films and programs."
14:33;14:35;"We came out of the gate hot, yep."
14:35;14:37;"We had Jamie Foxx."
14:37;14:38;"That was memorable."
14:39;14:41;"One day maybe we'll get back to that,"
14:41;14:43;"the real high-level stars."
14:43;14:44;"In the meantime,"
14:44;14:47;"between the Seinfeld theme song composer"
14:47;14:50;"and the invention of the Flamin' Hot Cheetos bagel,"
14:50;14:53;"I think we're getting coverage on Time Crisis"
14:53;14:55;"that you're really not going to find anywhere else."
14:55;14:58;"You're listening to..."
14:58;15:01;"Time Crisis on Beats 1."
15:01;15:02;"A lot of breath."
15:03;15:05;"A lot of bread, man."
15:05;15:07;"That was a lot of bread"
15:07;15:10;"that your dad, like, absconded with, man."
15:10;15:13;"And... [laughs]"
15:13;15:17;"Oh, man, that was just Mickey in the hot seat."
15:17;15:18;"Okay, but anyway,"
15:18;15:20;"just a little bit of background about Raj."
15:20;15:21;"Lush Life."
15:21;15:23;"I call him Raj 'cause I've known him since back in the day."
15:23;15:24;"Yep."
15:24;15:26;"He was almost like a mentor figure for me."
15:26;15:29;"I don't know if it was like this when you went to high school,"
15:29;15:31;"but I was just thinking about this."
15:31;15:32;"Like, when you're in middle school,"
15:32;15:34;"you kind of get to flex a little bit."
15:34;15:35;"Like, you know, if you're in seventh or eighth grade,"
15:35;15:36;"whenever you switch over,"
15:36;15:39;"you're kind of like the big kids in middle school."
15:39;15:41;"And you have a sense of, like, you're 12 or 13."
15:41;15:42;"You're like, ""We made it."""
15:42;15:44;"In the Jewish faith, you even have a bar mitzvah."
15:44;15:46;"All these things are happening at that age"
15:46;15:47;"where you're kind of like, ""We made it."""
15:47;15:49;"And then you turn 14,"
15:49;15:51;"you get knocked right back down to size."
15:51;15:52;"Now you're a freshman."
15:52;15:53;"That's a scary day, man."
15:53;15:54;"You might have been the cock of the walk,"
15:54;15:57;"but now--yeah, fresh-- fresh first day of high school."
15:57;15:58;"First day of high school?"
15:58;15:59;"That's a classic one."
15:59;16:00;"That's--yeah, it's like--"
16:00;16:01;"it makes you think of Freaks and Geeks."
16:01;16:02;"Whoo!"
16:02;16:03;"That's a weird one."
16:03;16:04;"But anyway, so, you know,"
16:04;16:05;"I remember being in freshman high school"
16:05;16:07;"and not knowing if I was gonna--"
16:07;16:09;"what it was gonna be like, and I remember--"
16:09;16:10;"I met a bunch of people."
16:10;16:12;"Raj was a senior when I was a freshman."
16:12;16:13;"We both were into music,"
16:13;16:15;"and very influential person in my life."
16:15;16:16;"Taught me a lot about music,"
16:16;16:19;"and he continues to make music, as do I."
16:19;16:21;"So anyway, Raj is gonna call in"
16:21;16:23;"and talk a little bit about his article."
16:23;16:24;"Cool."

19:00;19:04;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
19:04;19:08;"(Phone ringing)"
19:08;19:09;"What's up, Raj?"
19:09;19:10;"Hey, how's it going, guys?"
19:10;19:11;"Hey, how you doing, man?"
19:11;19:12;"Not bad."
19:12;19:17;"So, it was very cool to see that you had this op-ed in the Washington Post."
19:17;19:18;"Yeah."
19:18;19:25;"The title of the op-ed was ""Indian Americans Won't Be Safe As Long As The White House Is Inciting Fear."""
19:25;19:30;"So, I was curious. I just want to kind of share that with our listeners and talk about what inspired you to write this."
19:30;19:37;"Ever since the election, really, it's been, I think, for everybody, just been confusing time."
19:37;19:42;"And it's just, you know, I've been sort of finding different ways to process it all."
19:42;19:50;"And, you know, I spent basically 10 weeks after the election working on a mixtape that kind of dealt with how we got here and where to go next."
19:50;19:53;"And that was all before the inauguration."
19:53;19:57;"And post-inauguration, things just kind of got worse and worse."
19:57;20:02;"Hate crimes are on the rise, and particularly against Indian Americans, there's a rash of them."
20:02;20:11;"And I felt pretty compelled to speak out because I saw people in my community on social media and elsewhere, you know,"
20:11;20:19;"basically calling on Trump after one of the most egregious ones where, you know, there was actually somebody killed."
20:19;20:22;"It was an Indian engineer working in Kansas for Garmin."
20:22;20:29;"He was shot by his assailant after the assailant yelled, ""Get out of my country,"" or something."
20:29;20:38;"You know, just I saw so many people in my community saying, you know, calling on Trump to denounce the attacks and, you know,"
20:38;20:41;"waiting for him to make some sort of forceful comment on it."
20:41;20:47;"And I just felt like that was a useless approach to tackling the issue,"
20:47;20:57;"because the real story here is that the Trump administration, no matter what sort of lip service they might offer their actions or speaking volumes,"
20:57;21:09;"just in terms of the Muslim ban and, you know, calling for a border wall and pointing Jeff Sessions, who's a racist of epic proportions,"
21:09;21:12;"as attorney general, like, that's the stuff we need to be fighting."
21:12;21:20;"And so I basically wanted to stop everything I was doing and write a piece to call on Indian Americans, South Asians in general,"
21:20;21:27;"to stop asking for apologies for their denouncement of the hate crimes from Trump and to start organizing."
21:27;21:32;"One thing that I found interesting about your piece and that I kind of related to in my own way,"
21:32;21:39;"you point out the need for solidarity across boundaries, because it's kind of interesting in America, like a lot of times we talk about"
21:39;21:43;"sometimes one horrible thing happens to a specific community and we focus on that community,"
21:43;21:48;"but you also were talking about the ways in which it's all kind of interrelated, too."
21:48;21:56;"Well, yeah, with the shooting of Srinivas Kuchipothila in Kansas that I was talking about in the article,"
21:56;22:02;"the person who shot him, the reports say that that person mistook him for a Middle Eastern person."
22:02;22:13;"So ultimately, the anti-immigrant sentiment and policy and xenophobia that's directed at Muslims, it's affecting all of us."
22:13;22:18;"And so there's Islamophobia within the Indian community."
22:18;22:28;"And in the article, I talk about a fundraiser that Trump held in Edison, New Jersey, which is like a big Indian community there in New Jersey."
22:28;22:36;"And I remember it was in like October of last year, and I remember reading a BuzzFeed article about it the day after it happened."
22:36;22:42;"It's just amazing to me, the level of Islamophobia was like a theme of the evening, basically."
22:42;22:46;"Like before Trump spoke at it, they had all this entertainment."
22:46;22:49;"And apparently, like they have videos of it online."
22:49;23:02;"There was this dance sequence where couples are doing like the fox trot and then these terrorists ostensibly with lightsabers come out and start like attacking these
dancers."
23:02;23:06;"And then they're rescued by Navy SEALs and then they all start dancing."
23:06;23:08;"They're born in the USA. It's like totally crazy."
23:08;23:11;"So bananas."
23:11;23:17;"But like at that event, Trump said to the audience, I'm a big fan of Hindu."
23:17;23:20;"I just want to point that out because that's jumped out of me in an article."
23:20;23:23;"Trump is at a Hindu American fundraiser."
23:23;23:25;"I imagine there weren't a lot of Muslims in attendance."
23:25;23:31;"And so there's this kind of like bananas, terrorist dancing."
23:31;23:35;"And then when Trump takes the stage, he doesn't say I'm a big fan of the Hindu community."
23:35;23:41;"He literally says the sentence, I'm a big fan of Hindu."
23:41;23:50;"Yeah. And like, you know, fast forward whatever, four months later and he's showing his cards that he's not such a big fan of Hindu."
23:50;23:57;"And he's been reluctant to say anything about any of the recent hate crimes against Indians in this country."
23:57;24:03;"And so, yeah, I mean, I think instead of giving money to politicians, Indian Americans need to run in greater numbers."
24:03;24:13;"And I think we need to cross boundaries, sects of Sikh and Hindu and Muslim and start to realize that there's an attack on us all."
24:13;24:17;"And together is probably the only way we're going to effectively fight it."
24:17;24:20;"So tell me about the grizzly bear cover you just released."
24:20;24:28;"Rough Trade asked me to be part of this great 90 day project that they're doing called The Song of Day Keeps the Pain Away."
24:28;24:39;"And it benefits Southern Poverty Law Center. And they release a song every day for the first 90 days of Trump's administration."
24:39;24:44;"And I decided to cover Grizzly Bear's Foreground, which is one of my favorite songs."
24:44;24:49;"And my read on the song, it's about like a relationship falling apart."
24:49;24:57;"And I kind of projected that on maybe how I'm feeling about my relationship with this country at the moment."
24:57;25:08;"And it's bookended with two verses that take on the issues with xenophobia and nationalism that are at the fore right now."
25:08;25:12;"So, yeah, I released it last week and reception on it's been really great."
25:12;25:14;"And I'd like to play it for you guys."
25:14;25:15;"Cool."
25:16;25:23;"When the waters come crashing down in Babylon, justice of the peace turn around and bangers gavel on people in the streets."
25:23;25:27;"Give them heat if it's Ramadan. They always hated you and always will."
25:27;25:30;"And the Pentagon eyes wide shut on a bomb."
25:30;25:34;"Hella hypocritical when they the only ones holding nuclear arms."
25:34;25:37;"Rap phenomenon, lush V to rock, tell them."
25:37;25:41;"Take away the coffers of the bankers and the war mongerers and expel them."
25:41;25:45;"Follow the motion."
25:45;25:51;"Arms in the air, hands in the air."
25:51;25:57;"Work on another day."
25:57;26:04;"Something's marked, another justice."
26:04;26:15;"It is a foreground."
26:15;26:26;"Oh, those countrymen, take direction, get collected."
26:26;26:38;"I'm afraid they say, dead detected, not in ranking."
26:38;26:44;"Fall in, or take flight."
26:44;26:50;"Have a thought, or push it, soften."
26:50;26:55;"Something about this life."
26:55;27:01;"Take all evening, I'll just be cleaning."
27:01;27:07;"It is a foreground."
27:13;27:24;"Oh, little jimmy, matter evolving, motion and soften."
27:24;27:30;"Something about this life."
27:30;27:48;"Take all evening, I'll just be cleaning."
27:48;27:54;"Matter of fact, I'm the young Abyssinian, young Hindustani, Pakistani and the Indians."
27:54;27:57;"We all look the same, do a merengue condominium."
27:57;28:00;"Look at down plot and how to get us out the paint."
28:00;28:02;"Why they ruin the millennium."
28:02;28:05;"How you gonna practice self-care when you want welfare?"
28:05;28:08;"And the first order of business is to take your health care."
28:08;28:11;"Elsewhere they dropping bombs like lightning."
28:11;28:14;"Wicked white men is hyping men and it's frightening."
28:14;28:18;"I don't need to tell them that the world is steady hanging in the balance, so keep hyping it."
28:18;28:24;"Daily acts of protest, daily acts of unrest, daily acts of violence till they changing in the next step."
28:24;28:28;"Cool, thanks a lot Raj. So you're about to go on tour?"
28:28;28:32;"A little bit later this year, I'm just wrapping up a new record."
28:32;28:35;"Should be done in the next couple of weeks, fingers crossed."
28:35;28:40;"And I don't know if I can allow to talk about this yet, but I just signed a book deal."
28:40;28:42;"So kind of wrapping up some stuff on that."
28:42;28:43;"Oh, sick."
28:43;28:46;"I think we're planning some dates for the summer and onwards."
28:46;28:51;"Awesome. Any final thoughts that you want to leave the Time Crisis listeners with?"
28:51;28:54;"Oh yeah, FDT."
28:54;28:58;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
28:58;29:00;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
29:00;29:02;"One."
29:02;29:06;"Obviously we haven't been going too deep on politics on Time Crisis lately."
29:06;29:11;"We've been sometimes taking a breather to talk about Home Depot and some of the finer things in life."
29:11;29:14;"But of course, it's never far from our minds."
29:14;29:18;"It was really nice to hear from Raj and I really recommend everybody check out his op-ed"
29:18;29:26;"because it kind of shows one of the oldest lessons that we have that no form of hate is tolerable."
29:26;29:30;"It's nice to see obviously people we know educating others."
29:30;29:32;"Yeah, that's great."
29:32;29:37;"Well, what can we do given how horrible the world is,"
29:37;29:40;"given how much we all need to educate ourselves every day,"
29:40;29:44;"continue to donate money to places like the ACLU, Southern Poverty Law Center."
29:44;29:47;"I get four emails a day from John Ossoff."
29:47;29:49;"Who's that?"
29:49;29:53;"He's a 30-year-old dude running for Congress in Georgia."
29:53;29:59;"Tom Price, who is Trump's appointee to head up the Health and Human Services Department."
29:59;30:00;"Okay."
30:00;30:02;"So he was a congressman from Georgia."
30:02;30:05;"He got the job from Trump, so he vacated his congressional position."
30:05;30:07;"And so there's an open seat."
30:07;30:08;"Oh, in a special election."
30:08;30:11;"In this suburban Atlanta district."
30:11;30:15;"And John Ossoff is a 30-year-old kid, a Democrat, running."
30:15;30:16;"And it's neck and neck."
30:16;30:18;"A 30-year-old man, Jake."
30:18;30:19;"30-year-old man."
30:19;30:21;"You can't be putting that kind of energy out there."
30:21;30:24;"John Ossoff is a 30-year-old man who is running."
30:24;30:27;"So Trump won that district by a single percentage point."
30:27;30:31;"We got a tie ball game in this district between the Dems and the Republicans."
30:31;30:34;"And John Lewis noted Trump enemy."
30:34;30:35;"Yes."
30:35;30:37;"Is all about John Ossoff."
30:37;30:42;"And so there's a lot of national energy and money being focused towards this race,"
30:42;30:43;"which is in April sometime."
30:43;30:44;"It's coming up."
30:44;30:45;"Right."
30:45;30:50;"And so this is the exact stuff that right when Trump was elected,"
30:50;30:55;"the things that we told ourselves was like, OK, this is really bad."
30:55;30:57;"However, there's midterm elections."
30:57;30:58;"Yeah."
30:58;31:00;"There's going to be opportunities for the Democrats."
31:00;31:04;"They can't take back the White House anytime soon short of impeachment."
31:04;31:05;"Crazy."
31:05;31:06;"Or something crazy."
31:06;31:09;"But there are ways in which we can do this on a local level."
31:09;31:10;"Yeah."
31:10;31:13;"And so this right here is a sterling example,"
31:13;31:17;"a special election where the Democrats could win one more seat in the House."
31:17;31:19;"So John Ossoff is a 30-year-old man."
31:19;31:20;"What else do you know about him?"
31:20;31:21;"Not a whole lot."
31:21;31:22;"He's from that region."
31:22;31:24;"He sends a few too many emails."
31:24;31:25;"Yeah."
31:25;31:27;"So, yeah, I watched some YouTubes of him."
31:27;31:29;"And I just like, you know, I'm on these mailing lists."
31:29;31:31;"So I became aware of him a while ago."
31:31;31:36;"So then I was like, yeah, there's a lot of national momentum and energy on this race."
31:36;31:40;"And people are like, if he can win this seat in Georgia, that's a good sign."
31:40;31:41;"That's momentum."
31:41;31:44;"That's like a good harbinger of things for 2018."
31:44;31:50;"So, anyway, I'm giving him $5 a week until the election, which is in April or May or something."
31:50;31:54;"So, yeah, it's a pretty small in terms of like energy and money,"
31:54;31:57;"a pretty small drop in the bucket from me."
31:57;32:01;"But I just, you know, anyway, so I get four emails a day from him about it."
32:01;32:03;"I'm looking at a picture of John Ossoff."
32:03;32:04;"He's a good-looking guy."
32:04;32:05;"Yeah."
32:05;32:06;"And he has a beard."
32:06;32:11;"He kind of looks like a barista, but at like a nice place."
32:11;32:15;"And there's a ton of money coming in from the RNC running ads about him."
32:15;32:19;"And they found some like goofy videos of him from when he was in college."
32:19;32:20;"What was he doing, rapping?"
32:20;32:22;"No, he was like in like a a cappella group."
32:22;32:23;"Oh, God."
32:23;32:24;"You know what they were doing?"
32:24;32:25;"What?"
32:25;32:26;"They were doing Billy Joel, Uptown Girl."
32:26;32:28;"And what's the problem with that?"
32:28;32:29;"I don't know, it's a great song."
32:29;32:30;"Oh, what?"
32:30;32:31;"It's like, what's the--"
32:31;32:33;"Now the Republicans got a problem with Billy Joel?"
32:33;32:34;"Yeah, it's insane."
32:34;32:37;"They don't like the class anger of Uptown Girl."
32:37;32:38;"That's true."
32:38;32:41;"The Republicans, they don't want--"
32:41;32:42;"They don't want to talk about class."
32:42;32:46;"They don't want downtown guys and Uptown Girls getting together."
32:46;32:50;"They want that downtown guy to die because he doesn't have health care."
32:50;32:52;"They don't want Billy Joel to marry Christie Brinkley."
32:52;32:57;"I think it's exciting, like a really young man, 30-year-old guy running for Congress."
32:57;32:58;"I think that's cool."
32:58;33:00;"That's great."
33:00;33:01;"We should have him call in."
33:01;33:02;"Let's try to get him for the next show."
33:02;33:04;"Check him out."
33:04;33:06;"One more Democrat down in Georgia?"
33:06;33:07;"Yep."
33:07;33:08;"Come on."
33:08;33:09;"It's a no-brainer."
33:09;33:12;"Okay, so far we know at the very least he was in an acapella group."
33:12;33:14;"We haven't found out anything bad about him."
33:14;33:15;"And they sang Uptown Girl."
33:15;33:17;"I mean, come on, it's pretty good, right?"
33:17;33:19;"John, this one's for you and your golden pipes, bro."
34:34;34:39;"All right, so you ready for our second call of the day?"
34:39;34:40;"Yep."
34:40;34:42;"Now this one we're going over to the lighter side."
34:42;34:45;"We looked at some of the darkness in the world,"
34:45;34:49;"and now we're going to remember the reason why we care"
34:49;34:51;"is because there is beauty in this world."
34:51;34:55;"The reason why we want the world to continue and people to live in freedom"
34:55;34:57;"is so they can enjoy the beauty of the world."
34:57;35:01;"And what's often referred to as one of the most beautiful pieces of art"
35:01;35:04;"is not Seinfeld the series."
35:04;35:05;"That's--"
35:05;35:06;"Middling."
35:07;35:09;"But the Seinfeld theme song."
35:09;35:11;"Jake's doing some air bass already."
35:11;35:13;"[imitates air bass]"
35:13;35:14;"I want something to cue it in."
35:14;35:15;"I want to hear it."
35:15;35:16;"Can we listen to it before--"
35:16;35:19;"Yeah, let's listen to it because we're going to talk to the man who composed this."
35:21;35:23;"Oh, I forgot about those horns."
35:23;35:26;"Well, because, you know, they have to have little bumpers"
35:26;35:27;"for, like, different moments in the show."
35:27;35:28;"I thought it was just--"
35:28;35:31;"In my memory, it was just pure unaccompanied bass."
35:31;35:33;"This is, like, full."
35:35;35:40;"Well, there's so many versions."
35:40;35:41;"Oh, my God."
35:41;35:43;"I love it."
35:43;35:44;"That's probably what you're thinking of."
35:46;35:52;"We have to ask this guy if he played the bass."
35:52;35:55;"If it's him playing, it must be, right?"
35:55;35:58;"It almost sounds like a synth bass."
35:58;36:00;"Yeah, maybe you're right."
36:02;36:07;"That sounds synth-y."
36:07;36:08;"And you hear that--"
36:08;36:10;"[imitates synth bass]"
36:10;36:12;"Well, anyways, we're going to talk to this guy, Jonathan Wolfe."
36:12;36:13;"Well, it's '89."
36:13;36:14;"Is that when the show started?"
36:14;36:15;"Yeah, the show--"
36:15;36:16;"People, you know, ""Significant 90s Show,"""
36:16;36:18;"people forget that it started in 1989."
36:18;36:21;"So that's--yeah, if it was, like, a synth slap bass,"
36:21;36:23;"that seems perfect for '89."
36:23;36:25;"Yeah, we'll find out."
36:25;36:28;"There's definitely some programming happening."
36:28;36:30;"All right, so let's get on the phone with Jonathan Wolfe."
36:30;36:34;"Now, let's go to the ""Time Crisis"" hotline."
36:34;36:37;"[phone ringing]"
36:37;36:38;"Jonathan, what's up, man?"
36:38;36:40;"Ezra, what an honor."
36:40;36:42;"I'm so pleased to hear from you."
36:42;36:43;"Likewise."
36:43;36:45;"You're also on with my co-host, Jake,"
36:45;36:46;"and we're very psyched to have you on the show."
36:46;36:47;"Hey, what's up?"
36:47;36:49;"I'm happy to be here."
36:49;36:51;"Thanks for bringing me up."
36:51;36:53;"So, Jonathan, we talk about Seinfeld all the time on this show,"
36:53;36:55;"so it's really incredible to have you on."
36:55;36:57;"We were just listening to the theme song."
36:57;37:01;"So this was 1989 when you get the call to compose this theme?"
37:01;37:02;"Yeah."
37:02;37:03;"What were you doing then?"
37:03;37:05;"Were you already kind of in the TV composing game?"
37:05;37:07;"What was your background?"
37:07;37:09;"Yeah, I was already doing a few series."
37:09;37:12;"I was already had ""Who's the Boss?"""
37:12;37:15;"and ""Married with Children"" and a bunch of other shows."
37:15;37:19;"But I got this phone call from Jerry Seinfeld."
37:19;37:21;"Had you ever heard of him at that point?"
37:21;37:23;"No, no one had ever heard of him."
37:23;37:29;"He had one HBO special, and this was his big shot at doing TV."
37:29;37:34;"And he described to me a sound design issue."
37:34;37:37;"It was not really a music issue so much."
37:37;37:41;"He wanted his opening credits to be Jerry Seinfeld"
37:41;37:43;"standing in front of a group of people."
37:43;37:44;"He tells jokes, they laugh."
37:44;37:47;"And he wanted theme music to go with it."
37:47;37:50;"Now, you're too young to remember this,"
37:50;37:54;"but in the '80s, theme music was melodic."
37:54;37:58;"We did a lot of sassy saxophones and silly lyrics,"
37:58;38:00;"and I'm guilty of all that."
38:00;38:02;"But it was not going to work here."
38:02;38:07;"To use those would have been a recipe for an audio conflict"
38:07;38:09;"with his voice, so I pitched him,"
38:09;38:11;"""Hey, Jerry, how about this?"
38:11;38:14;"""Your human voice is the one we need to hear."
38:14;38:18;"""How about that's the melody of the Seinfeld theme?"
38:18;38:23;"""Every monologue you do will be a variation on the theme,"
38:23;38:26;"""and my job will be to accompany you in a way"
38:26;38:30;"""that is the elements will be thematic."
38:30;38:33;"""The organic nature of your human voice,"
38:33;38:35;"""talking and telling jokes and people laughing,"
38:35;38:37;"""might go well with the organic nature"
38:37;38:42;"""of my human lips and tongue, finger snaps, like this."""
38:42;38:46;"[claps and beatboxes]"
38:46;38:49;"-Ah, oh. -And I had his attention."
38:49;38:51;"-So he comes at you... -Yeah."
38:51;38:54;"-...with already a very forward-thinking, out-of-the-box idea."
38:54;38:57;"He's like, ""It's already 1989. It's almost the '90s."
38:57;39:00;"""No more of the schmaltzy..."""
39:00;39:02;"-""Alan Thicke."" -""Alan Thicke stuff."""
39:02;39:06;"Yeah, this is not gonna be pretty pictures of his cast"
39:06;39:09;"over a silly thing. No, it's him doing--"
39:09;39:12;"And that whole notion of getting away from the show"
39:12;39:16;"and presenting, in his case, comedy material,"
39:16;39:18;"aside from the plot of the show,"
39:18;39:21;"was kind of groundbreaking in itself."
39:21;39:23;"Right. So he's basically saying to you,"
39:23;39:26;"""I need instrumental music, but that's still gonna feel"
39:26;39:28;"""kind of thematic and fit with 'Go Under My Stand-Up.'"""
39:28;39:30;"-Yeah. -So you get the idea"
39:30;39:32;"that you want to do something kind of a cappella,"
39:32;39:34;"essentially, using the sounds that you can make"
39:34;39:36;"with your own voice."
39:36;39:38;"Were you influenced by, like, Bobby McFerrin?"
39:38;39:40;"Where does this idea come from?"
39:40;39:42;"Everybody's influenced by Bobby McFerrin,"
39:42;39:44;"even if they don't know it."
39:44;39:47;"-Sure words. -But mostly, I just wanted to get his attention."
39:47;39:49;"'Cause when you're doing a pitch,"
39:49;39:52;"that's the most important thing, is that they're not looking around."
39:52;39:54;"So I got his attention with that,"
39:54;39:57;"and said, ""Come on over, Jerry. Let's see what you got."""
39:57;40:01;"So he came over and showed me his HBO special,"
40:01;40:05;"and I watched it and noticed that his delivery,"
40:05;40:07;"the way his voice goes up and down,"
40:07;40:10;"and his motion, he kind of put a clock on it."
40:10;40:12;"[ Clicks tongue ]"
40:12;40:14;"About 110. And so, okay, that's..."
40:14;40:16;"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. Hold on."
40:16;40:19;"So you're watching Jerry Seinfeld do stand-up,"
40:19;40:21;"and your musical mind, the gears are turning,"
40:21;40:25;"and you're like, ""This guy tells jokes at 110 beats per minute."""
40:25;40:29;"Well, it's kind of reverse engineering the music for his choreography."
40:29;40:33;"Right, but you felt a natural musicality and rhythm in his stand-up."
40:33;40:37;"Yeah, he kind of moves, and he gives visual cues."
40:37;40:39;"He moves with his elbows and his fingers."
40:39;40:42;"He does -- If you watch him, he does --"
40:42;40:44;"It's not obvious,"
40:44;40:47;"not like Michael Richards' kind of physical comedy,"
40:47;40:50;"but he does move with his jokes."
40:50;40:53;"And I put a clock on it, and that's where I clocked it."
40:53;40:55;"I said, ""Let's try this and see how it works."""
40:55;40:58;"And it seemed to have a nice groove to go with him."
40:58;41:03;"The bass that people know that I added after that,"
41:03;41:06;"you know, 'cause you got to have some kind of musical element."
41:06;41:12;"At the time, slap bass had not yet enjoyed celebrity status"
41:12;41:14;"as a solo instrument."
41:14;41:17;"At the time, it was, you know, an element of funk music."
41:17;41:20;"-Jocko? -What's that?"
41:20;41:24;"-How about Jocko? -Jocko was not really doing --"
41:24;41:28;"Yeah, again, just like McFerrin, everybody loved Jocko."
41:28;41:32;"But that was not really his signature, the slap bass, right up front,"
41:32;41:34;"at least not that I'm aware of."
41:34;41:37;"Right, he was more that smooth, fretless..."
41:37;41:39;"-Okay. -Correct."
41:39;41:41;"He was a fretless monster."
41:41;41:44;"Is that a real bass on the Seinfeld?"
41:44;41:47;"Well, it was when I sampled it."
41:47;41:49;"Okay, break that down for us."
41:49;41:52;"To create a sonic brand,"
41:52;41:56;"something that's a new species of music,"
41:56;41:59;"as you know, sometimes you got to break a few rules."
41:59;42:02;"You got to do some audio gene splicing."
42:02;42:08;"At the time, sampling, editing technology was in its infancy."
42:08;42:11;"We had really crude, rudimentary tools."
42:11;42:16;"But I wanted to do it, so I sampled several of my basses."
42:16;42:20;"Just getting those samples, and then tweaked them and played with them"
42:20;42:25;"and created this kind of Frankenstein combination of those samples,"
42:25;42:29;"which became the Seinfeld sound."
42:29;42:33;"Loaded them all, mapped them out onto a keyboard"
42:33;42:35;"so that I could play it superhuman."
42:35;42:37;"You know, because there are certain things that --"
42:37;42:41;"So it was real bass sounds, but you were kind of performing it on a MIDI keyboard?"
42:41;42:43;"Correct, yeah."
42:43;42:46;"Nobody's that superhuman to do the kind of stuff I was doing."
42:46;42:47;"Wait, wait, I'm sorry."
42:47;42:51;"You're saying that no one could physically play those lines on a bass?"
42:51;42:53;"Some of them. Some of the stuff I was doing."
42:53;42:55;"The bends."
42:55;42:57;"Well, yeah, some of the sounds --"
42:57;42:58;"I was wondering about the bends."
42:58;43:01;"I'm sure some, but, you know, Thundercat could play the lines,"
43:01;43:03;"but it's not going to have that --"
43:03;43:05;"There are certain elements of the sample quality,"
43:05;43:08;"the way things get cut off, that would be impossible for a live bassist."
43:08;43:09;"Copy that."
43:09;43:10;"Correct."
43:10;43:13;"And things that happen to the tone and the texture"
43:13;43:16;"when you pitch bend and you use the mod wheel"
43:16;43:20;"and things like that that are just not natural sounding."
43:20;43:21;"And I kind of like that."
43:21;43:23;"There was even -- I did --"
43:23;43:25;"Just to make it pop a little bit more,"
43:25;43:28;"I took a narrow band of --"
43:28;43:29;"I don't even remember what the band was."
43:29;43:33;"Somewhere around 1.5 or 2k and phase reversed it,"
43:33;43:36;"put it back in, see what it would do."
43:36;43:39;"And what it does is it really jumps out."
43:39;43:42;"So it's a sampled bass, and all the other elements are snaps,"
43:42;43:45;"and you definitely hear that ""ah"" like a vocal sound."
43:45;43:48;"Everything else is also sampled organic sounds?"
43:48;43:49;"Yeah, pretty much."
43:49;43:52;"Well, there's those horns, those kind of cheesy late '80s --"
43:52;43:54;"What keyboard was that? You remember?"
43:54;43:57;"I don't remember. It was all samples."
43:57;43:59;"I was deep into sound."
43:59;44:05;"I can tell you that I was probably serving samples off of Sample Cell,"
44:05;44:11;"which was a PCI-based sample server."
44:11;44:13;"How old were you in 1989?"
44:13;44:16;"I want to paint more of a picture."
44:16;44:18;"I would have been 31."
44:18;44:21;"So you're 31, 1989."
44:21;44:22;"Yeah."
44:22;44:24;"What kind of music were you into outside of your work?"
44:24;44:26;"Were you listening to, like, hip-hop?"
44:26;44:28;"You had, like, the first ""Dayless Soul"" album?"
44:28;44:31;"Your sentence does not compute outside of my work."
44:31;44:33;"I was working like a fiend."
44:33;44:34;"I was working like crazy."
44:34;44:39;"My regular scheduled work week, Ezra, was over 100 hours a week."
44:39;44:40;"Good Lord."
44:40;44:46;"Just because I had that fear, that rush that all musicians have"
44:46;44:50;"at some point in their life where, ""Man, people are calling me"
44:50;44:53;"and paying me money to create music? Really?"
44:53;44:55;"I'm going to take those jobs."""
44:55;44:58;"When you're flavor of the week, a lot of people call."
44:58;45:00;"So I was taking a lot of work."
45:00;45:04;"I was flavor of the week way longer than I probably should have been,"
45:04;45:06;"but I was taking all those jobs."
45:06;45:11;"So I really didn't have a whole lot of time to listen to stuff."
45:11;45:13;"My music editor, a guy named Jack Diamond,"
45:13;45:18;"it was his job to make sure that I heard what was important."
45:18;45:20;"Every new album that came out, he would critique it."
45:20;45:24;"He would pick cuts on it that I had to listen to"
45:24;45:29;"and make sure that I at least was aware of the lexicon."
45:29;45:34;"So like season 2 of Seinfeld, he's like, ""There's a new band called Nirvana."
45:34;45:36;"You got to listen to them."""
45:36;45:38;"Really? They were new in '91?"
45:38;45:41;"Well, that's when the big album dropped in '91."
45:41;45:42;"'89's funny though."
45:42;45:46;"Was it like Motley Crue, like Dr. Feelgood record?"
45:46;45:47;"Throw that on."
45:47;45:49;"I was into rock, so yeah, those were my bands."
45:49;45:52;"'89 was a good year. Fine Young Cannibals, She Drives Me Crazy."
45:52;45:53;"That's '89, great song."
45:53;45:57;"And it was fun. Fine Young Cannibals, fun."
45:57;45:59;"They didn't mind, it was fun."
45:59;46:01;"They weren't so serious. I love that about them."
46:01;46:02;"Yeah, they were great."
46:02;46:03;"Well, you know what, Jonathan?"
46:03;46:07;"I don't know if you know, but one member of the Time Crisis crew"
46:07;46:11;"is a legendary Seinfeld fan called Seinfeld2000."
46:11;46:13;"I believe you've come across his work."
46:13;46:18;"I love that occasionally I just drop in and leave a little Easter egg,"
46:18;46:19;"little comments and things."
46:19;46:23;"I love that there's a format for that, like Seinfeld2000,"
46:23;46:25;"for me to reminisce a little bit."
46:25;46:26;"So thank you for that."
46:26;46:28;"He's keeping the flame alive, but he's here in the studio."
46:28;46:29;"Jonathan!"
46:29;46:32;"And we--okay, he's already on the mic."
46:32;46:33;"How are you?"
46:33;46:34;"Okay, I was going to introduce him, but--"
46:34;46:38;"Jonathan, I'm very excited. Sorry, I just jumped right in."
46:38;46:39;"Yeah."
46:39;46:41;"Jonathan, I usually play the background,"
46:41;46:45;"but the fact that you're on the show, I just had to get on the microphone."
46:45;46:47;"One of the things that I do with the account is"
46:47;46:50;"I like to imagine what Seinfeld would be like today."
46:50;46:51;"Do you ever think about that?"
46:51;46:53;"Like if the show was still on the air,"
46:53;46:56;"what Jerry and the gang would be up to if it was still on television?"
46:56;46:58;"Oh, God."
46:58;47:00;"I really don't think about those kind of things."
47:00;47:07;"The reality is we lived that experience for nine years,"
47:07;47:10;"and we're deep into--and we quit."
47:10;47:12;"We stopped doing it for a reason."
47:12;47:14;"It was time to do it."
47:14;47:17;"You know, you have to get it while you're on top before it gets stale."
47:17;47:22;"A lot of shows--and I've worked on those shows--stayed too long at the fair,"
47:22;47:24;"and they got stale."
47:24;47:28;"The creative juices that folks like you and others"
47:28;47:33;"who put Seinfeld in modern times with cell phones and electric cars and stuff--"
47:33;47:34;"iPads."
47:34;47:39;"They are way more creative than we probably would be at this point."
47:39;47:42;"Wow. Okay, I accept that."
47:42;47:47;"You know, it seems to me like you were part of the evolution of the TV theme,"
47:47;47:52;"and after Seinfeld things became just a lot shorter, the lyrics went away."
47:52;47:55;"I guess what I'm building up to here is that, you know,"
47:55;47:59;"a couple years after Seinfeld comes out, a show called Friends comes on the TV,"
47:59;48:07;"and they've got this damn four-minute-long intro with claps and lyrics and stuff."
48:07;48:11;"Did you guys ever just, you know, just watch that intro and just go,"
48:11;48:12;"""Oh, God."""
48:12;48:15;"I don't know if it was actually four minutes long, but okay."
48:15;48:16;"It felt four minutes."
48:16;48:17;"240."
48:17;48:18;"Yeah, 240."
48:18;48:24;"Seinfeld kind of juxtaposed itself with Friends as the not-Friends show."
48:24;48:29;"You know, Larry had certain rules--no learning, no hugging,"
48:29;48:33;"which is the opposite of Friends."
48:33;48:37;"You know, that theme, it splashed hard, and it still lives."
48:37;48:39;"People still know it. People still think of it."
48:39;48:45;"So all I can do is salute that theme and, you know, wish them well."
48:45;48:50;"I did plenty of shows like that that were kind of generic sitcom."
48:50;48:54;"Friends, however, did it really, really well."
48:54;48:59;"You know, those characters they had--you know, I don't really watch TV."
48:59;49:01;"I didn't watch Friends a lot, but I know who the characters are,"
49:01;49:05;"and I recognize those actors when I see them from being Friends."
49:05;49:07;"Here's a little factoid."
49:07;49:12;"After Seinfeld, Larry David did a movie."
49:12;49:13;"Sour Grapes."
49:13;49:14;"It was awful."
49:14;49:17;"Sour Grapes, that's right. You're the one."
49:17;49:21;"I did the music for it, and there was--did you actually see Sour Grapes?"
49:21;49:24;"I did. I didn't know you did the music for it, though. That's awesome."
49:24;49:31;"There was--one of the actors was a sitcom actor on a sitcom"
49:31;49:34;"that was lampooning Friends."
49:34;49:35;"You remember that?"
49:35;49:38;"And I wrote--there was actually an opening credits,"
49:38;49:41;"kind of like that opening credits for Friends,"
49:41;49:45;"so I got to write, you know, a fake Friends."
49:45;49:49;"Within the Larry David film Sour Grapes, there's a Friends parody."
49:49;49:55;"Yeah, yeah, and I think the song was ""I'll catch you if you fall"""
49:55;49:57;"instead of ""I'll be there for you."""
49:57;50:03;"It was pretty weird, but, you know, it was a job, and I did it."
50:03;50:06;"You just check that out."
50:06;50:09;"The rest of the movie, not so much."
50:09;50:11;"You know, just one more question, I guess."
50:11;50:13;"You and Jerry ever still chat?"
50:13;50:16;"You guys ever, you know, shoot the shit about music?"
50:16;50:17;"Ha!"
50:17;50:18;"That kind of thing."
50:18;50:19;"Not really."
50:19;50:25;"He--I'm retired. I fully retired in 2005, by the way."
50:25;50:26;"Good for you."
50:26;50:28;"Yeah, yeah, it was time."
50:28;50:33;"My wife and I decided that our family needed me more"
50:33;50:37;"than Hollywood needed more of my music,"
50:37;50:42;"so I retired and became a full-time PTA room parent"
50:42;50:45;"and sports assistant coach and field trip chaperone"
50:45;50:48;"and did that for about 10 years."
50:48;50:52;"Now the kids are older now, and they don't need me 24/7,"
50:52;50:54;"but for a while I did that."
50:54;51:00;"When I first started on Seinfeld, Jerry and I used to hang a little bit."
51:00;51:03;"We were both single, we were both guys about the same age,"
51:03;51:06;"and we would hang a little bit, and it was fun, I guess."
51:06;51:08;"What do you think of the Curb Your Enthusiasm music?"
51:08;51:11;"It's fun. It's good. It stays out of the way."
51:11;51:15;"Let's keep it real. Not as forward-thinking as the Seinfeld theme."
51:15;51:19;"He didn't, you know, there's no new--it's not a new species of music."
51:19;51:21;"He didn't reinvent a wheel."
51:21;51:24;"On its own, it's not really a sonic brand."
51:24;51:29;"It's not an earworm that would instantly identify"
51:29;51:31;"and create a signature for the show."
51:31;51:34;"Actually, our producer's telling us that that's just library music."
51:34;51:36;"That's probably true."
51:36;51:37;"Didn't even hire a composer."
51:37;51:39;"Here's a Larry David story. Ready?"
51:39;51:44;"I mean, see, I'm retired. I don't have to flatter anybody, right?"
51:44;51:47;"My last encounter with Larry--"
51:47;51:50;"and I'd worked with him since Seinfeld, as you already know."
51:50;51:56;"I start getting these shot breakdowns and schedules and crew lists"
51:56;51:59;"and things for Curb Your Enthusiasm at my office."
51:59;52:01;"And I didn't know anything."
52:01;52:04;"No one had hired me. Larry hadn't talked to me about it."
52:04;52:06;"I just started getting these materials."
52:06;52:08;"So I just kind of ignored them for a while,"
52:08;52:12;"because I'm looking to retire, and it's on cable, which I don't really do,"
52:12;52:16;"until I start getting cuts, you know, actual tapes."
52:16;52:19;"Now I've got to do what nobody wants to do."
52:19;52:23;"I had to call Larry David, which put yourself--"
52:23;52:27;"you're putting yourself right into that target range."
52:27;52:31;"You're in his scope now, because, you know, you're talking to him on the phone,"
52:31;52:34;"and I'd say, ""Hey, Larry, Curb looks great."
52:34;52:36;"You are funny. I'm really proud of you."
52:36;52:40;"Thanks for sharing those materials with me, but I got to tell you,"
52:40;52:45;"I'm retiring, so let me help you get somebody else to do your music, okay?"""
52:45;52:46;"Mm-hmm."
52:46;52:47;"And he says--"
52:47;52:50;"""What are you saying, Wolf? What do you mean?"""
52:50;52:51;"Oh, he had no idea."
52:51;52:54;"He couldn't compute that maybe I'm not doing a show."
52:54;52:57;"So Larry--and by the way, as you know from Curb,"
52:57;53:01;"Larry is lord of the gray area."
53:01;53:04;"If you're not black and white with him, he will take advantage of you,"
53:04;53:06;"and you will lose."
53:06;53:09;"So I said, ""Larry, I'm going to make this as clear as possible."
53:09;53:14;"I hope this is not offensive, but I am not the composer for Curb Your Enthusiasm."
53:14;53:16;"I will never be the composer for--"
53:16;53:19;"I'm never going to write a single note of music for your show."
53:19;53:22;"My name is never going to be in the credits."
53:22;53:25;"Is that clear enough?"""
53:25;53:27;"And he says, ""What are you saying?"
53:27;53:29;"You thought I was going to hire you?"
53:29;53:31;"I wouldn't hire you."
53:31;53:32;"You're a hack."""
53:32;53:34;"Oh."
53:34;53:37;"Wait, so why was he sending the tapes to your office?"
53:37;53:40;"Believe me, I don't want to go down that rabbit hole with him."
53:40;53:43;"I just said, ""I'll send them back."""
53:43;53:46;"But, yeah, of course he had assumed that I was going to do it"
53:46;53:48;"when I didn't want to do it."
53:48;53:50;"Then he turned."
53:50;53:54;"Which, as you know, he's really quite skilled at."
53:54;53:56;"If you ever interview him, get ready."
53:56;53:58;"He's going to pick a fight with you."
53:58;54:03;"And you can't win because guys like you and me, we just go through life."
54:03;54:05;"We're not looking for trouble."
54:05;54:10;"He actively seeks it out because he minds it for comedy."
54:10;54:14;"That's true. Curb Your Enthusiasm is all about Larry getting into trouble."
54:14;54:16;"He is only comfortable when you are not."
54:16;54:18;"So you were familiar with that."
54:18;54:20;"You were just like, ""All right, man, whatever."""
54:20;54:23;"Or you were like, ""You know what, Larry? Go f--- yourself."""
54:23;54:25;"No, I did not. I just did not want to get in."
54:25;54:27;"Because he will win."
54:27;54:31;"If you get into an argument, he will win because he's a pro, and I am not."
54:31;54:33;"So, ""You know what, Larry, you piece of s---?"
54:33;54:36;"Why don't you just go dig in the library music"
54:36;54:40;"and use some old Polka or Klezmer?"""
54:40;54:42;"""You know what? That's all you deserve."""
54:42;54:44;"And he said, ""I will do that."""
54:44;54:45;"""You know what, Wolf? I will do that."""
54:45;54:51;"I was just grateful that I did not have to recommend a friend to work with him"
54:51;54:55;"because, man, it's hazard pay."
54:55;54:58;"We're going to Larry because he is just so unpredictable."
54:58;55:04;"Now, he's also, lest the moment goes by, he's genius."
55:04;55:07;"-Absolutely. -Probably the best writer I've ever worked with"
55:07;55:10;"because he's Larry David."
55:10;55:13;"So there's that."
55:13;55:16;"Understood. Well, that was a great story. Thank you for sharing it with us."
55:16;55:19;"So, Jonathan, it's been amazing talking to you."
55:19;55:22;"Finally, this is a song we've been hearing our entire lives."
55:22;55:26;"We got all this new information about it, and I know the listeners are going to love this."
55:26;55:29;"Well, I'm so glad that you noticed my music."
55:29;55:35;"It makes me feel good that folks of different generations enjoy my work."
55:35;55:38;"And, man, long may it wave."
55:38;55:40;"It's going to live forever."
55:40;55:46;"And if you're ever out there enjoying your retirement in Louisville, Kentucky,"
55:46;55:52;"and a little earworm kind of enters your brain,"
55:52;55:57;"we could always use some new interstitial theme music on ""Time Crisis."""
55:57;56:02;"There's a whole bunch of young, hot, smart, strong music creators."
56:02;56:06;"People like you. I had my turn."
56:06;56:10;"I was at bat for a long time, and I hit that ball hard over and over again."
56:10;56:13;"It's no longer my turn. It's your turn."
56:13;56:18;"All you young folks, I travel around. I give lectures and concerts at universities now."
56:18;56:21;"And I meet a lot of really strong music creators."
56:21;56:26;"It's their turn to step up to the plate and do some really great music."
56:26;56:30;"So you're not going to hear anything else musically from me."
56:30;56:32;"I am fully retired. I wrote enough music."
56:32;56:38;"There were 75 primetime network series that I did."
56:38;56:40;"Okay, so that's a maybe?"
56:40;56:43;"[laughter]"
56:43;56:44;"No, okay, I got to say--"
56:44;56:45;"You're like Larry David."
56:45;56:47;"I really--you know what, Jonathan?"
56:47;56:50;"I wouldn't want you composing music for ""Time Crisis."""
56:50;56:52;"I don't need your music."
56:52;56:55;"I really respect that, Jonathan, because I always say this."
56:55;57:00;"You know, in the arts, I always respect people who retire,"
57:00;57:02;"not because I think people need to retire,"
57:02;57:06;"but because there's not a lot of people with the kind of generosity of spirit,"
57:06;57:08;"like with what you just said."
57:08;57:10;"You know, you look at some of the old rockers."
57:10;57:16;"They're going to cling to--you got to pry that career out of their cold, dead hands,"
57:16;57:20;"the idea that that kind of--you know, like you do your thing,"
57:20;57:25;"and you go enjoy life and let somebody else go put in those crazy 100-hour weeks."
57:25;57:27;"You know, it's like I really respect that,"
57:27;57:31;"and especially that you're going out and encouraging young composers too,"
57:31;57:33;"because you don't see that a lot."
57:33;57:36;"It's a lesson learned from Seinfeld, go out on top,"
57:36;57:38;"because I was still working when I--you know,"
57:38;57:41;"Will & Grace was still on the air, Reba was still on the air,"
57:41;57:46;"but it was time for me to leave, so that was a lesson I learned from Seinfeld."
57:46;57:49;"Know when it's time to quit."
57:49;57:51;"We appreciate that, Jonathan."
57:51;57:53;"All right, great talking to you, man."
57:53;57:56;"You too. Well, guys, thank you so much for reaching out to me."
57:56;57:59;"It is an honor to speak with you."
57:59;58:03;"I can't wait to tell my daughter, who's in college,"
58:03;58:05;"that I talked with Ezra Koenig tonight."
58:05;58:07;"Oh, that's great."
58:07;58:10;"And hey, I mean, I know that the composing music's out of the question,"
58:10;58:12;"but maybe you'll call in again."
58:12;58:14;"We can talk about who's the boss, Reba, another one,"
58:14;58:17;"because I know you probably get mostly Seinfeld questions."
58:17;58:19;"What do you think about that?"
58:19;58:21;"I'm happy to--yeah, you mean at the end of all of it,"
58:21;58:24;"most people want to talk about Seinfeld or Will & Grace,"
58:24;58:28;"but I'm happy to talk about any of them, and I enjoyed this a lot."
58:28;58:31;"I'm happy to--if you guys are having a slow news day"
58:31;58:34;"and you want to reach out to me again, happy to talk to you."
58:34;58:37;"Amazing. All right, thanks a lot, Jonathan. Great talking to you."
58:37;58:39;"Thanks, guys. Bye."
58:39;58:40;"Bye."
59:01;59:07;"Nobody move, there's blood on the floor"
59:07;59:13;"And I can't find my heart"
59:13;59:19;"Where did it go, did I leave it in the cold"
59:19;59:25;"So please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take"
59:25;59:31;"It must have fell when I lost my mind"
59:31;59:37;"I'm sweeping the cup, drowning it in pain"
59:37;59:43;"Somebody help, 'cause I can't find my way"
59:43;59:49;"Nobody move, nobody move"
59:49;01:00:06;"[harmonizing]"
01:00:06;01:00:12;"Ah"
01:00:12;01:00:17;"Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel"
01:00:17;01:00:23;"When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real"
01:00:23;01:00:29;"I'm trying hard, but I give my heart to you"
01:00:29;01:00:35;"Just to watch you throw it in the trash"
01:00:35;01:00:41;"I've been struggling so long, I don't think I can hold on"
01:00:41;01:00:46;"Where were you when I needed you the most"
01:00:46;01:00:52;"Now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest"
01:00:52;01:00:58;"A heartless, broken mess"
01:00:58;01:01:09;"[harmonizing]"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"Wow, Jake, that was a hell of a call."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"Amazing."
01:01:12;01:01:16;"I gotta say, I really like Jonathan Wolfe's vibe."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"Mm-hmm."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"He seemed to have the right attitude."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"He created this iconic piece of music,"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"and he's happy to talk about it."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"He's got definitely a generosity of spirit."
01:01:24;01:01:25;"He likes to share the stories."
01:01:25;01:01:29;"But at the same time, he also allows that to be"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"a fun piece of his past."
01:01:31;01:01:32;"Right."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"It's history."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"He's happy to talk about it, but it's also like,"
01:01:35;01:01:38;"you know, he doesn't need to go be out there"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"continuing to compose or using that to get other gigs."
01:01:41;01:01:42;"Right."
01:01:42;01:01:43;"That's cool."
01:01:43;01:01:44;"That's a good place to be, man."
01:01:44;01:01:46;"It seems like he has an inner peace."
01:01:46;01:01:47;"All right, Jake, you ready for the top five?"
01:01:47;01:01:48;"Yep."
01:01:48;01:01:51;"It's time for the top five."
01:01:51;01:01:55;"Five on iTunes."
01:01:55;01:01:57;"Oh, yeah."
01:01:57;01:02:02;"So this week, we're going to do a comparative top five,"
01:02:02;01:02:05;"of course, but we're not going to go back to 1981."
01:02:05;01:02:08;"We've been comparing this year to 1981 a lot"
01:02:08;01:02:11;"because of the Trump Reagan similarity."
01:02:11;01:02:15;"We're going to go back to 1989 because that's the year"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"that Seinfeld began."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"Yep."
01:02:19;01:02:21;"Now we know Jonathan Wolfe was so busy,"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"he wasn't listening to a lot of pop music,"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"but just to paint a picture of the zeitgeist,"
01:02:25;01:02:28;"we're going to look at the top five songs of 1989"
01:02:28;01:02:30;"and compare them with the top five songs of iTunes today."
01:02:30;01:02:34;"The number five song this week in 1989 was Rod Stewart."
01:02:34;01:02:37;"He was chatted up for multiple decades."
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Oh, is this Forever Young?"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"No, that was a little earlier, I think."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"This is My Heart Can't Tell You No."
01:02:42;01:02:43;"Do you know this song?"
01:02:43;01:02:44;"I don't know."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"I love Rod Stewart, but I don't--"
01:02:46;01:02:47;"Ooh."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"Ooh, listen to that."
01:02:49;01:02:51;"This is kind of vaporwave."
01:02:51;01:02:54;"So this is 17 years after Maggie Mae."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"Yeah."
01:02:55;01:02:58;"[MUSIC - ROD STEWART, ""90.7""]"
01:03:03;01:03:13;"You're listening to 90.7."
01:03:13;01:03:14;"I don't know this."
01:03:14;01:03:17;"[MUSIC - ROD STEWART, ""90.7""]"
01:03:17;01:03:38;"Listen to those synth marimba sounds."
01:03:38;01:03:41;"[MUSIC - ROD STEWART, ""90.7""]"
01:03:42;01:03:48;"I'm gonna wake up missing you, wake up missing you."

01:07:46;01:07:48;"She sings to her baby."
01:07:48;01:07:50;"And then she takes on the voice of the mother."
01:07:50;01:07:52;"So rockabye, baby, I'm going to rock you."
01:07:52;01:07:56;"And then Sean Paul comes in, and he's actually the second person."

01:13:42;01:13:44;"I don't know."
01:13:44;01:13:45;"Achilles kissed."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"Who's the dude that had his hair cut off and he lost his power?"
01:13:47;01:13:48;"Samson."
01:13:48;01:13:49;"OK."
01:13:49;01:13:50;"That's from the Bible."
01:13:50;01:13:51;"I love that one."
01:13:51;01:13:52;"That's an interesting story."
01:13:52;01:13:53;"Oh, that's a Bible one."
01:13:53;01:13:54;"That's a Bible story."
01:13:54;01:13:55;"I just want to point something out."
01:13:55;01:13:58;"I've heard people talk about when Chris Martin comes in the beginning of this,"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"they're like, oh, he's singing so low."
01:14:00;01:14:01;"It's almost weird."
01:14:01;01:14:02;"It's cool."
01:14:02;01:14:03;"It's cool, though."
01:14:03;01:14:06;"Do you know that meme that's like, my hands look like this so hers can look like this?"
01:14:06;01:14:07;"No."
01:14:07;01:14:12;"It's a-- you would show a picture of some grizzled worker's hands to imply that these"
01:14:12;01:14:17;"hands are the hands of the person in the relationship who works so that her hands can look like--"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"I guess this is very heteronormative."
01:14:19;01:14:20;"That's like old school."
01:14:20;01:14:21;"Yeah, actually--"
01:14:21;01:14:24;"In reality, you're both working 50 hours a week in an office."
01:14:24;01:14:28;"You both have super soft hands."
01:14:28;01:14:33;"The reality in modern America would be like, my hands look like this-- horrible, gnarled,"
01:14:33;01:14:37;"overworked hands-- so that hers can look like this-- comparably overworked."
01:14:37;01:14:43;"Anyway, my point was just that the meme is kind of like, we make a sacrifice here so"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"that this can be beautiful."
01:14:45;01:14:50;"The hands of the working partner in the relationship-- it should be beyond gender-- but the hands"
01:14:50;01:14:56;"of the working partner are gnarled, full of scabs, dirt, so that the hands of the other"
01:14:56;01:15:01;"partner can be gorgeous, bejeweled, bedazzled, whatever."
01:15:01;01:15:04;"I say all this because Chris Martin has to sing low here."
01:15:04;01:15:05;"Yeah?"
01:15:05;01:15:06;"So he can go high later."
01:15:06;01:15:07;"Exactly."
01:15:07;01:15:09;"So Chris Martin's voice sounds like this."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"[VOCALIZING]"
01:15:10;01:15:12;"His voice sounds like this here."
01:15:12;01:15:13;"[MUSIC - CHRIS MARTIN, ""SPIDERMAN'S CONTROL""]"
01:15:13;01:15:16;"Spider-Man's control, and Batman with his fingers."
01:15:16;01:15:18;"Kind of the low end of his range."
01:15:18;01:15:21;"I don't see myself at all at risk."
01:15:21;01:15:23;"She said, where'd she want to go?"
01:15:23;01:15:24;"So that his voice can get high."
01:15:24;01:15:25;"Yeah."
01:15:25;01:15:26;"But he's not done yet."
01:15:26;01:15:27;"No."
01:15:27;01:15:30;"If this was the highest note, he could have sang the whole thing up."
01:15:30;01:15:35;"Some superhero, some fairy tidbits."
01:15:35;01:15:39;"Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss."
01:15:39;01:15:42;"I want something just like this."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"We haven't even got to the payoff yet."
01:15:44;01:15:46;"[VOCALIZING]"
01:15:46;01:15:52;"I want something just like this."
01:15:52;01:15:53;"All right, come on, Chris."
01:15:53;01:15:56;"Show us why you picked this king."
01:15:56;01:15:58;"Where are you going to take it?"
01:15:58;01:16:03;"Oh, I want something just like this."
01:16:03;01:16:08;"Now you really feel the drop, because he went high."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"I want something just like this."
01:16:10;01:16:11;"I think it's over an octave."
01:16:11;01:16:13;"I sing the first verse really low."
01:16:13;01:16:15;"So the chorus sounds like this."
01:16:15;01:16:18;"[VOCALIZING]"
01:16:18;01:16:21;"So the chorus sounds like this."
01:16:21;01:16:24;"A little songwriting technique."
01:16:24;01:16:25;"Picking keys is hard."
01:16:25;01:16:26;"I didn't think about that a lot."
01:16:26;01:16:29;"Yeah, I wonder if he came in and they were messing around with keys."
01:16:29;01:16:32;"And then he was like, let's just drop it down even more, guys."
01:16:32;01:16:34;"Yeah, or maybe he was already in that key and it just worked."
01:16:34;01:16:38;"I mean, I'm sure Chris Martin is such a consummate professional singer-songwriter"
01:16:38;01:16:41;"that I bet he's so intimately familiar with his range."
01:16:41;01:16:42;"Right."
01:16:42;01:16:46;"I bet he's probably like, I can really now A high B."
01:16:46;01:16:47;"Yeah."
01:16:47;01:16:49;"E is a good key for me, because the fifth in the E is B."
01:16:49;01:16:51;"And I can just kill it."
01:16:51;01:16:52;"Right."
01:16:52;01:16:53;"It's crazy."
01:16:53;01:16:56;"Sometimes in the studio working on a song, you move something up a half step."
01:16:56;01:16:57;"It's like night and day."
01:16:57;01:16:58;"I always wonder about that."
01:16:58;01:17:01;"Sometimes you look songs up and they're like, it's in E flat."
01:17:01;01:17:03;"And you're just like, Jesus."
01:17:03;01:17:05;"I've been working on a song in E flat."
01:17:05;01:17:07;"It's such an awkward song to play on the guitar."
01:17:07;01:17:08;"It's awkward for a guitar."
01:17:08;01:17:10;"E flat's a classic key for piano."
01:17:10;01:17:14;"Because some people learn to play on the black keys kind of."
01:17:14;01:17:17;"So Beatles have a lot of songs in A flat and E flat."
01:17:17;01:17:19;"Yeah, or like B flat."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"You're just like, really?"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"I want to just do a better job of that."
01:17:22;01:17:26;"I sing the first verse really low."
01:17:26;01:17:28;"I sing the chorus just like this."
01:17:28;01:17:30;"Da da da da da da."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"Is that one octave you're doing?"
01:17:32;01:17:33;"What is that?"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"I sing the first verse really low."
01:17:35;01:17:38;"I sing the chorus just like-- yeah, it's over an octave, I think."
01:17:38;01:17:39;"Yeah."
01:17:39;01:17:40;"Like an octave and a half?"
01:17:40;01:17:44;"I mean, some people think that's what songwriting is all about, is about intervals."
01:17:44;01:17:46;"What, like jumping intervals, you mean?"
01:17:46;01:17:47;"Or the relation--"
01:17:47;01:17:52;"Or like just having it have a big harmonic spectrum."
01:17:52;01:17:54;"Yeah, and these things kind of go in and out of fashion."
01:17:54;01:17:57;"But for a long time, you know, the idea of a big chorus means that the vocals jump up."
01:17:57;01:18:00;"You know who loves to jump up octaves?"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"Um--"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"One of Chris Martin's predecessors, arguably."
01:18:04;01:18:05;"Bono."
01:18:05;01:18:06;"Yeah."
01:18:06;01:18:09;"Bono's also like a classic of just like--"
01:18:09;01:18:10;"(SINGING) With or without you--"
01:18:10;01:18:11;"Oh, dude."
01:18:11;01:18:12;"You're tapped in."
01:18:12;01:18:13;"Oh, wow."
01:18:13;01:18:14;"Great minds."
01:18:14;01:18:18;"(SINGING) With or without you, I know I can't live."
01:18:18;01:18:20;"With or without you, I can't--"
01:18:20;01:18:21;"I can't--"
01:18:21;01:18:22;"I can't live."
01:18:22;01:18:27;"I-- I-- I can't live."
01:18:27;01:18:30;"With or without--"
01:18:30;01:18:31;"Jump the octave."
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Yeah."
01:18:32;01:18:33;"Jumping octaves is not easy, though."
01:18:33;01:18:34;"Shout out to these guys."
01:18:34;01:18:35;"These guys have great voices."
01:18:35;01:18:37;"I can't jump the octave in every K."
01:18:37;01:18:41;"Bono's crazy, too, because when he's singing really high, it doesn't even sound that high."
01:18:41;01:18:47;"I remember like in high school being in a car and ""With or Without You"" was on, one of those Joshua Tree songs."
01:18:47;01:18:50;"And I tried to like-- I tried to match his note."
01:18:50;01:18:52;"And I had to do it in falsetto."
01:18:52;01:18:54;"It's like-- (SINGING) With or without you--"
01:18:54;01:18:56;"But he's actually singing it like full--"
01:18:56;01:18:57;"Full voice, yeah."
01:18:57;01:18:58;"Full voice."
01:18:58;01:18:59;"He has a beautiful voice."
01:18:59;01:19:00;"Yeah."
01:19:00;01:19:02;"At that point, I was like, oh, whoa, I can't sing at all."
01:19:02;01:19:06;"We all have to take the range God gave us and make it as good as possible."
01:19:06;01:19:08;"And maybe you can expand it a little bit, but--"
01:19:08;01:19:09;"Yeah."
01:19:09;01:19:14;"You know, Bob Dylan couldn't sing something just like this."
01:19:14;01:19:15;"No."
01:19:15;01:19:16;"Yeah, he made it work."
01:19:16;01:19:20;"(SINGING) A single fuzz was really low."
01:19:20;01:19:23;"Joshua Tree was only two years old in '89."
01:19:23;01:19:24;"Three."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"'87, bro."
01:19:26;01:19:28;"'86."
01:19:28;01:19:29;"Money on this."
01:19:29;01:19:30;"OK, yeah, I think you're right."
01:19:30;01:19:31;"Tariq came out in '87."
01:19:31;01:19:33;"Yeah, all right, I think you're right."
01:19:33;01:19:34;"Is it '87?"
01:19:34;01:19:37;"I wonder if they were still putting out singles like almost into '89."
01:19:37;01:19:38;"Big album like that?"
01:19:38;01:19:39;"I don't know."
01:19:39;01:19:40;"I'm curious."
01:19:40;01:19:41;"They're still working on it."
01:19:41;01:19:42;"Like One Tree-- what's that?"
01:19:42;01:19:43;"Like Red Dirt Town or Red Dirt--"
01:19:43;01:19:44;"One Tree Hill."
01:19:44;01:19:45;"Yeah."
01:19:45;01:19:46;"Yeah, you're right."
01:19:46;01:19:47;"You're right."
01:19:47;01:19:48;"It was March '87."
01:19:48;01:19:49;"(SINGING) Hangin' on."
01:19:49;01:19:50;"All right, let's go back to 1989."
01:19:50;01:19:51;"Ah, this is a classic."
01:19:51;01:19:52;"I was just talking about them."
01:19:52;01:19:53;"Remember Milli Vanilli?"
01:19:53;01:19:54;"Oh, yeah."
01:19:54;01:20:02;"For our younger listeners, this was the German R&B duo that was kind of put together."
01:20:02;01:20:03;"The guys were chosen for their looks."
01:20:03;01:20:06;"They were not actually the singers on the song."
01:20:06;01:20:09;"And they would kind of pretend they would lip sync."
01:20:09;01:20:10;"Live at their shows."
01:20:10;01:20:11;"Live."
01:20:11;01:20:14;"And nobody really cares about lip syncing, but they were lip syncing to other people's"
01:20:14;01:20:15;"voices."
01:20:15;01:20:20;"And this is really crazy is that they won the Grammy for Best New Artist, and it was"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"taken back once they got caught."
01:20:22;01:20:24;"Do you think that would happen now?"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"They did not sing at all on the album."
01:20:26;01:20:27;"They could not sing straight up."
01:20:27;01:20:29;"I just don't think anybody would pull that these days."
01:20:29;01:20:30;"Right."
01:20:30;01:20:32;"Because also, you don't need to be as good of a singer."
01:20:32;01:20:37;"You could, with auto-tune, even people without great pitch can still express themselves on"
01:20:37;01:20:38;"the mic."
01:20:38;01:20:42;"I remember seeing clips of the recording of that album, and it was like a middle-aged"
01:20:42;01:20:43;"guy singing the parts."
01:20:43;01:20:45;"Like, ""Girl, you know it's true."""
01:20:45;01:20:48;"Yeah, and famously, that's the song we're about to listen to, ""Girl, You Know It's True."""
01:20:48;01:20:49;"Great song."
01:20:49;01:20:54;"When they got caught, they were doing a live performance, and the tape started skipping."
01:20:54;01:20:57;"And it kept skipping on, ""Girl, you know it's true."""
01:20:57;01:20:58;"""Girl, you know it's true."""
01:20:59;01:21:01;"And they just kind of looked at each other, and just like, ""Ugh."""
01:21:01;01:21:05;"God, that is like, can you imagine, sorry to sound, but can you imagine the pressure"
01:21:05;01:21:06;"of that?"
01:21:06;01:21:07;"So what are you doing back?"
01:21:07;01:21:11;"Well, I sat back and thought about the things we used to do."
01:21:11;01:21:12;"It really made me..."
01:21:12;01:21:13;"Also, keep in mind, these guys were German."
01:21:13;01:21:14;"That's weird."
01:21:14;01:21:16;"I really mean that much to you?"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"Was it German dudes singing it, or American dudes?"
01:21:18;01:21:19;"""Girl, you know it's true."""
01:21:19;01:21:20;"That's a good question."
01:21:20;01:21:23;"I mean, sick production."
01:21:23;01:21:25;"This still sounds fresh, actually."
01:21:26;01:21:30;"But can you imagine the pressure those guys must have dealt with every day?"
01:21:30;01:21:34;"No, you know what's really sad is that they became villainized, and one of the guys ended"
01:21:34;01:21:37;"up dying eight, nine years later."
01:21:37;01:21:38;"Jesus Christ."
01:21:38;01:21:39;"Like, depressed."
01:21:39;01:21:43;"And I think back on drugs, medication, petty crime."
01:21:43;01:21:44;"Oh my God, dude."
01:21:44;01:21:45;"Let them live."
01:21:50;01:22:08;"I have this weird memory of playing Little League and being on the mound at baseball"
01:22:08;01:22:14;"practice, pitching, and having this song coursing through my head."
01:22:14;01:22:19;"I was basically replaying the song in my mind, in vivid detail."
01:22:19;01:22:22;"And I remember my, like, it was like a TV show in my mind."
01:22:22;01:22:25;"I remember my coach coming up and yelling at me."
01:22:25;01:22:27;"I was listening to the song in my head."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"Really?"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"And he was yelling at me, and I wasn't listening to him."
01:22:30;01:22:31;"It's a super weird memory."
01:22:31;01:22:32;"Drake!"
01:22:32;01:22:33;"Yeah?"
01:22:33;01:22:34;"Throw a fastball!"
01:22:34;01:22:37;"And you're just in your head, just like, how old are you?"
01:22:37;01:22:38;"Twelve?"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"And you're just on the mound."
01:22:40;01:22:41;"I was listening to this in my head."
01:22:41;01:22:43;"And you're just like, ""Girl, you know it's true."""
01:22:43;01:22:44;"Yeah."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"Joe Carpasassi."
01:22:46;01:22:48;"Was the coach?"
01:22:48;01:22:50;"Coach Carpasassi, I'm sorry."
01:22:50;01:22:52;"Get your head out of your ass."
01:22:52;01:22:56;"I'm sorry, Coach Carpasassi, I got vanilla in my eye."
01:22:56;01:22:58;"Well, you get it out, kid."
01:22:58;01:23:00;"Really random memory."
01:23:01;01:23:03;"My emotions start up when I hear your name."
01:23:03;01:23:05;"Maybe a sweet, sweet voice was ringing my ears."
01:23:05;01:23:08;"Stimulate my senses, girl, when you on me."
01:23:08;01:23:10;"Now what you wear, I don't care how you dress."
01:23:10;01:23:13;"I'm the reason that I like you, girl, you see what you are."
01:23:13;01:23:15;"If I say to think about it, you rule my world."
01:23:15;01:23:17;"You try to understand."
01:23:17;01:23:19;"I'm in love, girl."
01:23:19;01:23:21;"I'm still in love, girl."
01:23:21;01:23:24;"I'm just in love, girl."
01:23:24;01:23:26;"And this is true."
01:23:26;01:23:29;"Girl, you know it's true."
01:23:30;01:23:34;"Oh, oh, oh, I love you."
01:23:34;01:23:37;"I had that Milli Vanilli full length."
01:23:37;01:23:38;"Really?"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"Blame it on the rain."
01:23:40;01:23:42;"They had two big hits."
01:23:42;01:23:43;"That was another one."
01:23:43;01:23:44;"I feel like they had three."
01:23:44;01:23:47;"Do you remember Blame It On The Rain?"
01:23:47;01:23:48;"Yeah."
01:23:48;01:23:50;"These guys are, well, I heard more after the fact."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"'89, what a weird period."
01:23:52;01:23:54;"'89, there were cool things happening."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"You know what?"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"People are too hard on lip syncers, man."
01:23:59;01:24:01;"Remember Jessica Simpson?"
01:24:01;01:24:03;"Oh, Ashley Simpson, I'm sorry."
01:24:03;01:24:04;"Kind of."
01:24:04;01:24:07;"She sang, she was a singer, but on SNL,"
01:24:07;01:24:10;"she was lip syncing to make herself feel more comfortable or something."
01:24:10;01:24:12;"Or maybe her voice wasn't sounding good that day."
01:24:12;01:24:15;"And it kind of really hurt her career."
01:24:15;01:24:17;"And it was kind of like, man, who cares?"
01:24:17;01:24:18;"Right."
01:24:18;01:24:21;"The funny thing is, people get more uptight about"
01:24:21;01:24:24;"vocals are this unique thing."
01:24:24;01:24:27;"It's like if you found out the keyboards were on a track,"
01:24:27;01:24:30;"and the doo-doo, nobody would care."
01:24:30;01:24:32;"What is it about vocals?"
01:24:32;01:24:35;"If you watch those '60s, a lot of those '60s--"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"Like Ed Sullivan or something?"
01:24:37;01:24:40;"Yeah, a lot of that's the instruments on tracks."
01:24:40;01:24:43;"Maybe the vocals are just like a window to the soul or whatever."
01:24:43;01:24:46;"That's the signature part."
01:24:46;01:24:50;"But you don't think of Ashley Simpson with a distinct voice."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"No, whatever."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"I mean, she had a voice."
01:24:53;01:24:55;"We all have voices, Jake."
01:24:55;01:24:57;"I'm not even bashing-- I'm just saying like--"
01:24:57;01:25:00;"I guess I also just kind of feel like,"
01:25:00;01:25:02;"you know there's still some people who get all uptight about"
01:25:02;01:25:04;"who writes their own songs?"
01:25:04;01:25:05;"Yeah."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"So there's still these old school people who'd be like,"
01:25:07;01:25:10;"""That pop star is not a true artist."
01:25:10;01:25:11;"She doesn't write her own songs."""
01:25:11;01:25:13;"And then other people are like, ""Who cares?"""
01:25:13;01:25:14;"Yeah."
01:25:14;01:25:16;"What if there was just a different tradition where"
01:25:16;01:25:18;"there were people who were studio singers,"
01:25:18;01:25:21;"and other people would just go lip sync?"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"Like, none of it makes any sense."
01:25:23;01:25:25;"Okay, maybe it's the deception."
01:25:25;01:25:28;"Like in old school musicals, that's often the case."
01:25:28;01:25:29;"A different person sings."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"Right, but maybe it's the deception."
01:25:31;01:25:34;"Basically, it's like, ""If you're going to lip sync, come clean."
01:25:34;01:25:36;"I want to know what I'm getting."""
01:25:36;01:25:37;"And so if I find out--"
01:25:37;01:25:41;"That would be interesting if just like a really attractive person"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"came out and they were just like--"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"""I didn't sing this."""
01:25:44;01:25:46;"Actually, these days, you know,"
01:25:46;01:25:48;"people kind of can build careers off of"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"pictures of themselves on Instagram"
01:25:50;01:25:53;"in a way that you used to have to be like a professional model."
01:25:53;01:25:55;"But now you really can just share pictures of yourself."
01:25:55;01:25:56;"I'm doing that."
01:25:56;01:25:58;"You're doing it. We all do that."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"Some people get more paid off than others,"
01:26:00;01:26:02;"but we all do that. We all post selfies."
01:26:02;01:26:06;"Some people are like, ""Oh, you know, what happened to real talent?"
01:26:06;01:26:09;"This person, they just have a million Instagram followers"
01:26:09;01:26:10;"just because they're hot."""
01:26:10;01:26:11;"Yeah."
01:26:11;01:26:13;"And it's kind of like, life is meaningless."
01:26:13;01:26:14;"Like, who cares?"
01:26:14;01:26:16;"Well, people don't like that as a takeaway."
01:26:16;01:26:18;"Life is meaningless. Nothing means anything."
01:26:18;01:26:22;"No one wants that as the takeaway of cultured entertainment."
01:26:22;01:26:24;"I think the issue is the deception."
01:26:24;01:26:25;"Right."
01:26:25;01:26:28;"So I'm saying somebody should come out and not deceive."
01:26:28;01:26:30;"Somebody should come out and be like, ""Listen,"
01:26:30;01:26:33;"I am a pop star not because I write songs or sing,"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"but because I've got cool style."""
01:26:35;01:26:37;"""I'm working out eight hours a day."""
01:26:37;01:26:39;"""I work out eight hours a day. I don't even have time to learn the songs."
01:26:39;01:26:41;"And I will be there for the photo shoots."
01:26:41;01:26:42;"I will be in the video."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"And you know what? I'll be at the concert,"
01:26:44;01:26:46;"and I'll be staying late signing autographs."
01:26:46;01:26:49;"But yeah, you're not going to hear my voice because I can't sing."""
01:26:49;01:26:52;"I think a lot of people would find that refreshing"
01:26:52;01:26:54;"and would support that pop star."
01:26:54;01:26:56;"It's kind of Trump."
01:26:56;01:26:58;"Oh, God. Okay. Now I don't like it."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"Yeah, it's kind of Trump just being like, ""Listen,"
01:27:00;01:27:03;"I'm not a good person."
01:27:03;01:27:04;"I'm not trustworthy."""
01:27:04;01:27:05;"""I have no talent."""
01:27:05;01:27:08;"""I have no talent, but I keep it real."""
01:27:08;01:27:12;"""Yeah, I'll lie to you, but I won't lie to you."""
01:27:12;01:27:14;"""I like this guy."""
01:27:14;01:27:16;"That's all you have to do is you can literally be like,"
01:27:16;01:27:17;"""I might be dishonest."
01:27:17;01:27:20;"I might not tell the truth, but I won't lie to you."""
01:27:20;01:27:22;"Yeah, I don't think that would fly, man."
01:27:22;01:27:23;"I'm going to try."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"If there's anybody out there--"
01:27:25;01:27:26;"That'd be like a weird--"
01:27:26;01:27:27;"If there's anybody out there--"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"Like Andy Warhol-style art project."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Anybody out there who wants to be a pop star,"
01:27:31;01:27:35;"but doesn't write songs, doesn't know music, and doesn't sing."
01:27:35;01:27:37;"No talent. Maybe has a dance."
01:27:37;01:27:39;"No, I think your talent is your--"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"It's like reality TV or Instagram."
01:27:41;01:27:43;"Your talent is your natural magnetism."
01:27:43;01:27:44;"Right, natural charisma."
01:27:44;01:27:47;"I guess what I'm saying is natural magnetism"
01:27:47;01:27:51;"might be more important than singing voices and writing talent."
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Clearly."
01:27:52;01:27:55;"Anyway, hit me up if you're interested."
01:27:55;01:27:56;"Back to our time."
01:27:56;01:27:58;"Sam Hunt, ""Body Like a Back Road."""
01:27:58;01:27:59;"Remember this?"
01:27:59;01:28:00;"Oh, yeah."
01:28:00;01:28:01;"Body like a back road."
01:28:06;01:28:07;"Oh, yeah."
01:28:20;01:28:21;"Fell about."
01:28:27;01:28:28;"Persistent."
01:28:30;01:28:31;"I like that."
01:28:31;01:28:33;"Took him six weeks."
01:28:33;01:28:37;"But I've been working on some stuff in a similar vein."
01:28:37;01:28:39;"Not musically or vibe-wise,"
01:28:39;01:28:42;"but that feeling that I saw you once,"
01:28:42;01:28:44;"this person walking by with braids."
01:28:44;01:28:46;"I didn't know you."
01:28:46;01:28:49;"And I continued not to know you for six weeks."
01:28:49;01:28:52;"And now, now we go way back."
01:28:52;01:28:54;"There was a time we didn't know each other."
01:28:54;01:28:57;"And now we go way back, like Cadillac sings."
01:28:57;01:28:59;"They were in the same circles."
01:28:59;01:29:02;"He was seeing a lot of her over that six-week period."
01:29:02;01:29:05;"It wasn't just like, ""I saw this girl at the coffee shop."
01:29:05;01:29:06;"I've been obsessed with her."""
01:29:06;01:29:08;"And then six weeks later, I saw her again."
01:29:08;01:29:10;"I feel like he's saying, like--"
01:29:10;01:29:11;"He's saying--"
01:29:11;01:29:12;"They were working--they were like on the same--"
01:29:12;01:29:15;"It took me six weeks to get--yeah, okay, I can picture it."
01:29:15;01:29:16;"You know what I mean?"
01:29:16;01:29:19;"Maybe she's like the waitress at the local diner,"
01:29:19;01:29:23;"and he's coming in, and he's being like,"
01:29:23;01:29:26;"""I'm gonna say hi, and I'll get your number."""
01:29:26;01:29:27;"God, that's a funny dynamic."
01:29:27;01:29:31;"And she's just like--it's a little bit of harassment."
01:29:31;01:29:32;"You gotta just let it go."
01:29:32;01:29:35;"If you're like a super cute girl working at a coffee shop,"
01:29:35;01:29:38;"you just have, like, 15 guys a day coming in."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"Oh, Jesus."
01:29:39;01:29:42;"Who are like regulars, like getting the coffee on the way to work."
01:29:42;01:29:43;"Oh, God, what a nightmare."
01:29:43;01:29:44;"I've seen that happen."
01:29:44;01:29:45;"It's, like, brutal."
01:29:45;01:29:48;"You're standing in line, and the guy's trying to get his 45 seconds"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"of FaceTime to flirt with her,"
01:29:50;01:29:52;"to try to, like, move the ball down the field--"
01:29:52;01:29:54;"Oh, God, is that what this song is about?"
01:29:54;01:29:55;"What?"
01:29:55;01:29:58;"Sam's like, ""She worked down at the Starbucks."""
01:29:58;01:29:59;"Yeah."
01:29:59;01:30:00;"Just, like, every morning--"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"I'm on my way to the job site."
01:30:02;01:30:04;"I park my F-150."
01:30:04;01:30:07;"I'm on my way to Home Depot."
01:30:07;01:30:09;"You know what's also so brutal about that?"
01:30:09;01:30:12;"It's, like--I'm also just picturing it just, like, rush hour."
01:30:12;01:30:15;"Just, like--you know when you go to Starbucks and there's, like--"
01:30:15;01:30:16;"Slammed."
01:30:16;01:30:18;"You know, it doesn't take much to make a Starbucks feel full."
01:30:18;01:30:20;"Just, like, 11 people in line."
01:30:20;01:30:22;"Oh, my God."
01:30:22;01:30:25;"It's just, like, 11 people in line just waiting, like--"
01:30:25;01:30:26;"just doing all this sh--."
01:30:26;01:30:28;"People being like, ""This is not what I ordered."""
01:30:28;01:30:29;"""Can I have the next guest?"""
01:30:29;01:30:31;"And then just, like, some dude just kind of lingering by the place"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"where they put the drinks out, just being like--"
01:30:33;01:30:36;"""Uh, so anyway, how was your weekend?"""
01:30:36;01:30:37;"Yeah."
01:30:37;01:30:39;"""Um, it was pretty good, Frank."
01:30:39;01:30:41;"""Can I get that macchiato?"
01:30:41;01:30:43;"""Oh, yeah, oh, that's cool."
01:30:43;01:30:44;"""Are you doing anything special?"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"""Um..."""
01:30:46;01:30:50;"Just, like, what kind of maniac would just monopolize somebody's time like that?"
01:30:50;01:30:54;"Dude, I just remembered I actually asked a girl out that worked at a coffee shop."
01:30:54;01:30:55;"Oh, God."
01:30:55;01:30:56;"In 2000."
01:30:56;01:30:57;"You're no better than Sam Hunt, man."
01:30:57;01:30:59;"No, no, no, but here's how I did it."
01:30:59;01:31:00;"It was a block from my place."
01:31:00;01:31:01;"Yeah."
01:31:01;01:31:02;"But here's the thing."
01:31:02;01:31:05;"I was so self-conscious of this concept, and I would not linger."
01:31:05;01:31:07;"But, like, I was in there enough so we knew each other's names,"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"and then I called her."
01:31:09;01:31:10;"At the coffee shop?"
01:31:10;01:31:11;"No, I called her at home."
01:31:11;01:31:12;"I don't know how I had her number."
01:31:12;01:31:15;"Well, that's a pretty important part of the story is how you got her number."
01:31:15;01:31:17;"How the hell did I have her number?"
01:31:17;01:31:18;"I don't remember."
01:31:18;01:31:21;"That's incidental."
01:31:21;01:31:22;"Was this pre-cell phones?"
01:31:22;01:31:25;"Yeah, straight-up landline, cold call."
01:31:25;01:31:26;"And did you go out on a date?"
01:31:26;01:31:27;"Nope."
01:31:27;01:31:28;"She just shut you down?"
01:31:28;01:31:29;"I think she had a boyfriend."
01:31:29;01:31:31;"Oh, did you have to stop going to that coffee shop?"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"I think I took a breather."
01:31:33;01:31:37;"Like a solid, like, 60-day breather on it."
01:31:37;01:31:38;"It was fine."
01:31:38;01:31:40;"It was not, like, a big deal."
01:31:40;01:31:41;"Okay."
01:31:41;01:31:44;"I mean, is there a way -- this is the Sam Hunt song situation."
01:31:44;01:31:47;"I mean, look, there's marriages that started in a coffee shop."
01:31:47;01:31:52;"Sometimes you meet people in unexpected ways, and it's a little awkward."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"I mean --"
01:31:53;01:31:56;"You know, yeah, it's a tough one because you've got these, like,"
01:31:56;01:31:58;"scumbag pickup artist types."
01:31:58;01:32:01;"For the record, I do not feel at all bad about asking that girl out."
01:32:01;01:32:04;"And she seemed kind of -- I remember, like, my memories."
01:32:04;01:32:05;"I was, like, 22."
01:32:05;01:32:06;"Maybe she was, like, 27."
01:32:06;01:32:10;"I think she was sort of like, ""Oh, that's cute."""
01:32:10;01:32:11;"She wasn't weirded out."
01:32:11;01:32:15;"It's maybe no different than any other situation where you ask somebody out."
01:32:15;01:32:17;"Okay, I remember now."
01:32:17;01:32:19;"I did an exhibition at the coffee shop."
01:32:19;01:32:21;"I hung my art in the coffee shop for a month."
01:32:21;01:32:23;"That's why I had her number."
01:32:23;01:32:27;"And then I called her, and I was like, ""Hey, I'm going to go see this"
01:32:27;01:32:31;"art exhibition downtown in a few days."
01:32:31;01:32:33;"Do you want to roll?"""
01:32:33;01:32:35;"Chill."
01:32:35;01:32:36;"That's -- okay."
01:32:36;01:32:37;"That seems appropriate."
01:32:37;01:32:38;"You guys had already established a relationship."
01:32:38;01:32:42;"She was, like, organizing the art shows at the coffee shop, so I, like --"
01:32:42;01:32:45;"that's why I had her -- anyway, blah, blah, blah."
01:32:45;01:32:48;"All right, well, all I can say is Sam Hunt."
01:32:48;01:32:50;"I guess Sam Hunt it worked out."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"Bought it like a back road."
01:32:52;01:32:53;"Let's go back to 1989."
01:32:53;01:32:55;"Bangles, Eternal Flame."
01:32:55;01:32:56;"That's a good one."
01:32:56;01:33:03;"This is a great one."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"'89 is kind of popping."

01:33:18;01:33:21;"This feels like it could have been written by, like, the Bee Gees."

01:43:39;01:43:41;"Yeah, he was in Genesis."
01:43:41;01:43:43;"Mike was in Genesis before."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"So yeah, his dad's like a--"
01:43:45;01:43:46;"Old English guy."
01:43:46;01:43:47;"Right."
01:43:47;01:43:48;"And he's like--"
01:43:48;01:43:50;"He's running around with Peter Gabriel."
01:43:50;01:43:55;"His dad's probably like a World War II guy, and then he has this, like, snotty rock star son."
01:43:55;01:43:57;"Not even rock star, just like--"
01:43:57;01:43:58;"Yeah, he's like--"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"He's like a musician's son."
01:44:00;01:44:01;"Oh, God."
01:44:01;01:44:02;"He's growing his hair out, and he's just like, ""Dad."""
01:44:02;01:44:05;"Dad, come see my progressive rock band."
01:44:05;01:44:10;"And he goes, sees Peter Gabriel wearing, like, a costume, and his dad's just like, ""Get a real job."""
01:44:10;01:44:13;"But, Dad, it's in 7/16 time."
01:44:13;01:44:15;"I don't care."
01:44:15;01:44:17;"A song shouldn't be nine minutes."
01:44:17;01:44:21;"And then his dad drops dead in, like, 1982 or something."
01:44:21;01:44:24;"Mm."
01:44:24;01:44:26;"It's pretty, like, Springsteen-y, too."
01:44:41;01:44:43;"Stilted conversation."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"Man, it'd be tough."
01:45:50;01:45:53;"Like, my parents and I see more of this eye-to-eye."
01:45:53;01:45:55;"Like, for instance, like, with the last election."
01:45:55;01:45:59;"Like, if my parents were Trump supporters, that would be tough, man."
01:45:59;01:46:03;"That would be, like-- And I have friends that, you know, are in that situation."
01:46:03;01:46:06;"It would be a real weird--"
01:46:06;01:46:07;"Man, I mean--"
01:46:07;01:46:09;"As you said, stilted conversation."
01:46:09;01:46:10;"That's heavy."
01:46:10;01:46:19;"Obviously, you gotta-- If your parents are making political decisions that ruin other people's lives, you can't take their side."
01:46:19;01:46:21;"You have to limit your sympathy."
01:46:21;01:46:27;"But at the same time, generally speaking, we consider family a permanent bond that you have to work through."
01:46:27;01:46:29;"Absolutely."
01:46:29;01:46:33;"I mean, a lot of people would say you don't have to--"
01:46:33;01:46:37;"You shouldn't give too much ground to Trump supporters."
01:46:37;01:46:40;"Well, you don't have to give them any ground politically."
01:46:40;01:46:42;"I don't know, man. That's a tough one."
01:46:42;01:46:44;"Let's just look at the chorus for a second."
01:46:44;01:46:47;"Say it loud. Say it clear."
01:46:47;01:46:50;"You can listen as well as you hear."
01:46:50;01:46:53;"It's too late when we die."
01:46:53;01:46:56;"""Die"" is such a heavy word, right?"
01:46:56;01:46:59;"To admit we don't see eye to eye."
01:46:59;01:47:01;"You know what's brutal?"
01:47:01;01:47:04;"It's so much of life is just acceptance."
01:47:04;01:47:08;"You know, like, there's-- This has been a very tough thing for me to learn in life."
01:47:08;01:47:11;"This is classic. This is tough for everybody."
01:47:11;01:47:16;"To learn that there's not always resolution in life."
01:47:16;01:47:19;"And you want to believe that there's resolution in life."
01:47:19;01:47:23;"And I can understand if you're somebody with very different beliefs than your parents"
01:47:23;01:47:27;"or like this guy's dad in World War II and he's just like, ""They just don't get each other."""
01:47:27;01:47:31;"You want to believe that if you'd done something differently,"
01:47:31;01:47:35;"if you listened more or something, that there could have been a resolution."
01:47:35;01:47:38;"But what's an even more bitter pill to swallow is sometimes it's not."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"Not on the cards."
01:47:40;01:47:43;"It's not always in the cards."
01:47:43;01:47:45;"And, yeah, you know, that's life."
01:47:45;01:47:49;"And I think that's the thing that's been really hard for me in life."
01:47:49;01:47:51;"Should I have done something? Yeah, it's tough."
01:47:51;01:47:56;"I mean, maybe that's the difference between him and Bruce Springsteen."
01:47:56;01:48:01;"Because this song is like a little sentimental and a little maudlin and schmaltzy."
01:48:01;01:48:06;"Because it's like, you know, the message he's putting forth, like, you don't really buy."
01:48:06;01:48:08;"Like, you can listen as well as you hear."
01:48:08;01:48:10;"And it's like, well, it doesn't work out that way."
01:48:10;01:48:19;"But he's acknowledging the divide with his father and not trying to sugarcoat it with, like--"
01:48:19;01:48:21;"Like, this is brutal. Yeah."
01:48:21;01:48:24;"This pain will haunt me. This pain will haunt me."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"That's the Bruce-- Right."
01:48:26;01:48:33;"Later, Mike, and the mechanics, says, ""I wasn't there that morning when my father passed away."
01:48:33;01:48:35;"I didn't get to tell him all the things I had to say."""
01:48:35;01:48:36;"That's brutal."
01:48:36;01:48:41;"You ever heard a story like that, somebody wasn't there when a loved one passed and wished they were there?"
01:48:41;01:48:43;"But the tough part is that--"
01:48:43;01:48:47;"And maybe you would feel better if you got to say everything you wanted to say."
01:48:47;01:48:48;"I certainly believe that. Sure."
01:48:48;01:48:53;"But the tough part is even if you get to say all the things you want to say to a person,"
01:48:53;01:48:57;"it doesn't necessarily mean that resolution-- you're going to get resolution."
01:48:57;01:48:59;"Yeah, or that's going to resonate with them."
01:48:59;01:49:00;"I know. It's brutal."
01:49:00;01:49:02;"Are you doing it for them or you?"
01:49:02;01:49:05;"Like, yeah, that'd be way more Bruce to be like, you know--"
01:49:05;01:49:08;"And look, this is this guy's lived experience, so I'm not trying to take away from it,"
01:49:08;01:49:14;"but just in terms of what it makes me think about, it would be more Springsteen-ian to be like,"
01:49:14;01:49:18;"""I went back one last day. I said all the things I had to say."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"He just shook his head and I just walked away."""
01:49:20;01:49:23;"That'd be like some-- you know, that feeling of like--"
01:49:23;01:49:25;"Yeah, it'd be ambiguous."
01:49:25;01:49:27;"Yeah. And it'd be like--"
01:49:27;01:49:29;"I did. Because sometimes-- that's a really brutal song."
01:49:29;01:49:32;"This song is almost like, ""I missed my chance to do what I should have done,"""
01:49:32;01:49:36;"and that's haunting in its own way, but to also be like, ""I did everything I could,"
01:49:36;01:49:39;"and I was still left with a lack of resolution."""
01:49:39;01:49:41;"That's such an awful part of life."
01:49:41;01:49:45;"Yeah. And the tone of this song is almost suggesting that he thinks he would have had--"
01:49:45;01:49:50;"it's like a naive hope and belief that he would have had the sense of resolution,"
01:49:50;01:49:52;"which I don't think he would have."
01:49:52;01:49:56;"Now, doesn't the song end with like, ""It's all good because it's the cycle of life and I--"""
01:49:56;01:49:58;"Well, yeah, he says, ""I think I caught his spirit later that same year."
01:49:58;01:50:01;"I'm sure I heard his echo in my baby's newborn tears."
01:50:01;01:50:04;"I just wish I could have told him in the living years."""
01:50:04;01:50:08;"That's terrible. That's awful lyric writing. I mean, I get it. He's feeling it."
01:50:08;01:50:11;"No, but you know what? You remember that song we listened to that--"
01:50:11;01:50:13;"I don't think you like Cat's Cradle? The cats in the cradle?"
01:50:13;01:50:14;"Oh, I hate that song."
01:50:14;01:50:18;"But that song is about-- the singer of that song had conflict with his dad."
01:50:18;01:50:19;"Right."
01:50:19;01:50:22;"And then later, the end of that song is like, ""And now I have a son."
01:50:22;01:50:25;"And I have conflict with my son too."""
01:50:25;01:50:26;"The circle game."
01:50:26;01:50:33;"So the circle of life, the positive spin is like people die, but new people come into the world."
01:50:33;01:50:36;"And there's always a chance for redemption and hope, whatever."
01:50:36;01:50:41;"But then the negative side is kind of like-- another way to look at it was like this guy had conflict with his father."
01:50:41;01:50:43;"Later that same year, he had a baby."
01:50:43;01:50:50;"And he realized that human life is suffering and it's hard to connect or something."
01:50:50;01:50:54;"Bruce just would have never brought up his newborn baby's tear."
01:50:54;01:50:56;"Uh..."
01:50:56;01:50:57;"He wouldn't have."
01:50:57;01:51:00;"There's no way. It's too maudlin."
01:51:00;01:51:02;"Yeah, he might talk about his baby."
01:51:02;01:51:06;"As I hold my baby son in my arms"
01:51:06;01:51:08;"Late, Bruce."
01:51:08;01:51:11;"I know there's nothing I could do"
01:51:11;01:51:16;"The factory was closing down and I'm done too"
01:51:16;01:51:20;"I said, ""Daddy, I'm not in need."""
01:51:20;01:51:24;"You're born alone and you die alone"
01:51:24;01:51:30;"I hold my son, I pray to God his life won't be marked by these fears"
01:51:30;01:51:33;"'Cause there's nothing you can do"
01:51:33;01:51:37;"The hopes and dreams"
01:51:37;01:51:43;"'Cause I know he won't find happiness in the living years"
01:51:43;01:51:47;"When death's embrace takes my sweet son"
01:51:47;01:51:49;"I don't know."
01:51:49;01:51:54;"But whatever. I still like this song and this is his experience."
01:51:54;01:51:57;"Oh, that's a great song. I'm into this song."
01:51:57;01:51:58;"It's a great song, yeah."
01:51:58;01:52:00;"It's a little over the line, but I'm in."
01:52:00;01:52:03;"That was the number one song in 1989."
01:52:03;01:52:10;"The number one song in 2017 is not so concerned with that type of stuff."
01:52:10;01:52:13;"It's a little more concerned with matters of the flesh."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:52:15;01:52:18;"Not as existential."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"People gotta have sex."
01:52:20;01:52:21;"Well, I mean, they don't."
01:52:21;01:52:22;"Circle of life, dude."
01:52:22;01:52:27;"The club isn't the best place to find a lover, so the bar is where I go"
01:52:27;01:52:28;"Bed sheets?"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"Yeah, exactly."
01:52:30;01:52:31;"I like to imagine that--"
01:52:31;01:52:33;"This song is called ""Bed Sheets,"" right?"
01:52:33;01:52:36;"Ed Sheeran is Mike and the Mechanic's baby son growing up."
01:52:36;01:52:38;"Oh my God."
01:52:38;01:52:42;"1989, he was held in his father Mike and the Mechanic's arms."
01:52:42;01:52:45;"Was Ed Sheeran born in '89?"
01:52:45;01:52:46;"Wouldn't surprise me."
01:52:46;01:52:49;"Wait, how old--Ed would make you 28, wouldn't it?"
01:52:49;01:52:51;"He's probably a little younger."
01:53:04;01:53:05;"This is a massive song."
01:53:05;01:53:07;"Yeah, it's big."
01:53:07;01:53:08;"I mean, that's the circle of life."
01:53:08;01:53:11;"It's like this pain that other people experienced in the past,"
01:53:11;01:53:16;"and then 28 years later, you're taking girls to a Chinese buffet"
01:53:16;01:53:19;"and making out in the backseat of the cab."
01:53:19;01:53:21;"These are all parts of life."
01:53:21;01:53:26;"I don't mean to imply that Mike and the Mechanic's are better than Ed Sheeran"
01:53:26;01:53:32;"because their number one song had more gravitas, 'cause the truth is,"
01:53:32;01:53:37;"as much as life is about haunting memories and death and the circle of life,"
01:53:37;01:53:43;"it is equally about Chinese buffets, making small talk, sensuality, lust."
01:53:43;01:53:45;"Anything is valid subject matter."
01:53:45;01:53:47;"That's right."
01:53:47;01:53:51;"We should point out that Ed Sheeran gave songwriting credits on this song"
01:53:51;01:53:54;"recently to the people who wrote TLC ""No Scrubs."""
01:53:54;01:53:56;"Oh, whoa."
01:53:56;01:53:59;"Whoa, like 18 years ago or whatever?"
01:53:59;01:54:00;"Yeah."
01:54:00;01:54:01;"That song's old."
01:54:01;01:54:03;"I guess 'cause--I mean--"
01:54:03;01:54:04;"Wait, what?"
01:54:04;01:54:05;"'Cause there's a part of his song where he goes--"
01:54:05;01:54:10;"I may be crazy, don't mind me, say boy, let's not talk too much."
01:54:10;01:54:12;"Grab on my waist and do the--"
01:54:12;01:54:13;"I guess--"
01:54:13;01:54:16;"No, I don't want your number, no."
01:54:16;01:54:18;"I don't want to give you mine, and no--"
01:54:18;01:54:20;"Girl, I don't want--"
01:54:20;01:54:21;"That's a stretch."
01:54:21;01:54:23;"I think it's a stretch, personally."
01:54:23;01:54:24;"Ed Sheeran--"
01:54:24;01:54:26;"There's like a billion songs like that without cadence."
01:54:26;01:54:29;"Ed Sheeran, I think, has been sued a lot lately, so he's probably a little--"
01:54:29;01:54:30;"He has?"
01:54:30;01:54:33;"Yeah, the Marvin Gaye's family sued him for--"
01:54:33;01:54:35;"He has a song that kind of has a similar groove"
01:54:35;01:54:40;"and some melodic similarities to ""Let's Get It On."""
01:54:40;01:54:41;"Oh, really?"
01:54:41;01:54:42;"'Cause--"
01:54:42;01:54:43;"♪ Let's get it on ♪"
01:54:43;01:54:44;"And Ed Sheeran goes--"

01:54:54;01:54:55;"I don't know."
01:54:55;01:54:58;"I always think that when it comes to suing people,"
01:54:58;01:55:01;"you should err on the side of eh."
01:55:01;01:55:02;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:55:02;01:55:04;"Yeah, there's been 10 million pop songs."
01:55:04;01:55:06;"There's going to be a little crossover."
01:55:06;01:55:09;"I understand that people--"
01:55:09;01:55:12;"Well, first of all, there was once some commercials"
01:55:12;01:55:16;"for some random movie that had these brutal fake Vampire Weekend songs in it,"
01:55:16;01:55:19;"and it was funny 'cause one was fake A-punk,"
01:55:19;01:55:22;"and then right after it they played fake Oxford comma."
01:55:22;01:55:25;"And I just remember watching those and being like,"
01:55:25;01:55:28;"""You know, we could go get the musicologist and try to be like,"
01:55:28;01:55:30;"'Mm, that's clearly based on this.'"""

01:55:36;01:55:37;"That's funny."
01:55:37;01:55:39;"Like, it's funny and also--"
01:55:39;01:55:43;"I mean, what if that song had gone and become a huge hit?"
01:55:43;01:55:45;"Well, that's an interesting point."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"Would you say it was a bad horror movie?"
01:55:47;01:55:50;"No, it's just some random comedy. It's like a low-budget comedy or something."
01:55:50;01:55:54;"So yeah, what if someone wrote a blatant A-punk rip?"
01:55:54;01:55:55;"Instead of--"
01:55:55;01:55:56;"♪ Da-da-da-da ♪"

01:55:59;01:56:01;"Some weird version."
01:56:01;01:56:03;"It's hard to know where to draw the line."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"It was like number one."
01:56:05;01:56:08;"Well, that's an interesting question because then some part of you has to say,"
01:56:08;01:56:12;"""Okay, so the fact that it went number one, that's what made me finally sue?"""
01:56:12;01:56:14;"""Is because I got dollar signs?"""

01:56:45;01:56:47;"I don't know. Remember we were talking about the Libertines in the last show?"
01:56:47;01:56:49;"Remember the Libertines were kind of like the English Strokes?"
01:56:49;01:56:50;"Right."
01:56:50;01:56:53;"They looked similar, but they did their own thing."
01:56:53;01:56:54;"It's still different."
01:56:54;01:56:57;"You still know that they're two different things."
01:56:57;01:56:59;"You know, what if the Strokes sued the Libertines?"
01:56:59;01:57:01;"I almost feel like that's going to happen."
01:57:01;01:57:03;"We're going to get to a point where that happens,"
01:57:03;01:57:05;"where people are just like--"
01:57:05;01:57:07;"Remember that guy Skeet Ulrich?"
01:57:07;01:57:08;"And everybody was like--"
01:57:08;01:57:09;"That actor?"
01:57:09;01:57:10;"Yeah, he looks like Johnny Depp."
01:57:10;01:57:11;"Okay."
01:57:11;01:57:13;"He was just a dude who looked like Johnny Depp."
01:57:13;01:57:15;"And no, he's a fine actor, but--"
01:57:15;01:57:17;"And people were just like, ""Oh, he's the fake Johnny Depp."
01:57:17;01:57:18;"He's the budget Johnny Depp."""
01:57:18;01:57:20;"People talk that way about actors a lot."
01:57:20;01:57:23;"Or sometimes you think that you did something so original"
01:57:23;01:57:25;"and somebody takes a similar idea and does it better."
01:57:25;01:57:27;"You got to just take that L."
01:57:27;01:57:28;"Take that L."
01:57:28;01:57:30;"Skeet Ulrich really looks like Johnny Depp."
01:57:30;01:57:32;"Yeah, but you couldn't sue for--"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"I mean--"
01:57:34;01:57:36;"Yeah, that's the more thing with actors,"
01:57:36;01:57:43;"with someone is the poor man's version of so-and-so."
01:57:43;01:57:45;"It's a little different with music."
01:57:45;01:57:47;"Yeah, no, of course it's different with music."
01:57:47;01:57:52;"I just think ethically, I'm not saying I would never sue somebody."
01:57:52;01:57:56;"I would just try to draw the line as charitably as possible."
01:57:56;01:57:57;"Right."
01:57:57;01:57:59;"Also, you know what's tough?"
01:57:59;01:58:01;"There's also the thing about honesty."
01:58:01;01:58:05;"It's like sometimes you can be inspired by a song and just lie about it,"
01:58:05;01:58:08;"but if somebody comes to you and is like, ""Hey, listen, your song inspired it,"""
01:58:08;01:58:12;"and then you're like, ""Okay, you're directly saying that you based it off of this."
01:58:12;01:58:14;"All right, thank you."
01:58:14;01:58:16;"Give you my piece."""
01:58:16;01:58:18;"But if I just hear something and I'm like--"
01:58:18;01:58:20;"We were talking about ""Kids Don't Stand a Chance"" before."
01:58:20;01:58:23;"[singing]"
01:58:23;01:58:25;"That's such a basic idea."
01:58:25;01:58:26;"If somebody came out with something and went,"
01:58:26;01:58:31;"[singing]"
01:58:31;01:58:33;"and had the same drum groove, I'd have to be like,"
01:58:33;01:58:37;"""All right, this is inspired by what we did."""
01:58:37;01:58:40;"But, like, whatever, it's lame."
01:58:40;01:58:42;"I don't know."
01:58:42;01:58:45;"Yeah, well, if they had a different vocal and, you know--"
01:58:45;01:58:46;"Whatever."
01:58:46;01:58:47;"Ed Sheeran is--"
01:58:47;01:58:50;"It's over the line, I think, that he had to, like, give writing credit."
01:58:50;01:58:51;"Maybe he did."
01:58:51;01:58:53;"He's probably just scared of getting sued."
01:58:53;01:58:54;"That sucks."
01:58:54;01:58:56;"Although, maybe he got away with some other theft,"
01:58:56;01:58:59;"and he was like, ""This is my penance."""
01:58:59;01:59:00;"Heavy."
01:59:00;01:59:04;"Well, those are the top five songs of 2017 and 1989."
01:59:04;01:59:06;"Wow, Jake, that was a hell of an episode."
01:59:06;01:59:07;"Yep."
01:59:07;01:59:10;"We talked to Raj Halder, Lush Life."
01:59:10;01:59:14;"We talked to Jonathan Wolfe, composer of the ""Seinfeld"" theme song."
01:59:14;01:59:16;"And we counted down the hits."
01:59:16;01:59:17;"Some work he asked for."
01:59:17;01:59:19;"I will see everybody in two weeks."
01:59:19;01:59:20;"Thank you."
01:59:20;01:59:23;"""Time Crisis"" with Ezra King."
01:59:23;01:59:27;"Beats 1."
