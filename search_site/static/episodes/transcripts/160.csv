00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis back again. On this week's episode we delve deep into the heart of"
00:08;00:16;"the alleged NFT week with Despot. We also hear new music from Adele, old music"
00:16;00:23;"from Sheena Easton and so much more. Check which timeline you're on because"
00:23;00:30;"you're about to enter. Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:14;01:19;"Alright let's do this thing. Start the show. That always made a big"
01:19;01:23;"impression on me. Do you remember there used to be a Hulk Hogan reality show"
01:23;01:28;"with his whole family? No I missed that one. I mean it's kind of sad because I'm"
01:28;01:33;"pretty sure he and his longtime wife Linda split up and I think there's a"
01:33;01:38;"it's been troubles for some of the kids but in the beginning there's a part"
01:38;01:42;"where the Hulkster calls out to each member of the family with some type of"
01:42;01:49;"exhortation to like begin just like ""Linda let's go like Brooke haul ass"" and"
01:49;01:54;"I remember to somebody he goes ""Nick let's do this thing"" it's just one of"
01:54;02:00;"those things. Okay brother. Let's do this thing. It was called Hogan knows best. Oh"
02:00;02:04;"Hogan knows best of course. I mean I don't remember anything about the show"
02:04;02:08;"other than the the opening but it made a big impression on me. It's just you know"
02:08;02:11;"sometimes just a phrase hits you at a certain time in your life and it just"
02:11;02:16;"anytime I'm in a beginning scenario now I have a family of my own so sometimes"
02:16;02:21;"I'm the one kind of revving up the Hummer trying to get the family to come"
02:21;02:29;"go. Rashida let's do this thing. Rashida let's do this thing. Get in the Hummer we're"
02:29;02:35;"going to Costco. Anyway it's useful for a family scenario and anybody with family"
02:35;02:39;"but you know what you don't need to have kids you could say it to your roommate"
02:39;02:44;"you could say it to your friend you could say it to your co-hosts on your"
02:44;02:51;"internet radio show slash podcast let's do this thing. Anyway apologies if my"
02:51;02:58;"quality is lower today. I've been having mic problems. Alright welcome back to"
02:58;03:04;"time crisis Jake and Nick good to see you. Seinfeld he had to do something for"
03:04;03:10;"his other job. Wait I just had a thought like Seinfeld has like a full-time job"
03:10;03:17;"he's desk jockey but I wonder if if you added up all the hours of time crisis"
03:17;03:22;"that one of us does in a year if it's comparable to working at Sweet Martha's"
03:22;03:30;"you know the classic two week a year. Oh right. We do like roughly what 24 a year?"
03:30;03:38;"Eps? Yeah 25. We're clocking in at 50 hours of content but probably like 75"
03:38;03:43;"hours of work total. That'd be like working part-time at the Sweet Martha's"
03:43;03:48;"stall for like two weeks. Yeah pulling a couple. Should we consider a new model"
03:48;03:55;"where just every August we go rent a nice house up on Lake Minnetonka in"
03:55;04:00;"the beautiful Minnesota wilderness. Get everybody together can bring some"
04:00;04:05;"friends, partners, whoever and we just bang out a whole year's worth in two"
04:05;04:10;"weeks. We're gonna eat good. Jake's man on the grill. Sweet Martha's cookies for"
04:10;04:16;"everybody and we can kind of guess what might happen in the next year. Maybe next"
04:16;04:19;"year we'll try that. Trying to wrap my mind around as much time as I feel we"
04:19;04:25;"put into this and I love it that we work one week a year. No no more like two"
04:25;04:28;"weeks. Wait sorry let's get the math right. Man now I really wish I really"
04:28;04:32;"wish Seinfeld was here. The one time we have an actual number crunch. It's about"
04:32;04:38;"75 hours and when I look up a 70 hour workweek it's basically we work a"
04:38;04:43;"truckers workweek. They're not allowed to work more than 70 hours. And 70 hours is"
04:43;04:46;"a hardcore workweek. Oh it's a hardcore workweek. No no. There's a lot of"
04:46;04:51;"Americans who do work 70 hours a week. No if Apple were making us do this every"
04:51;04:56;"week we would unionize. Like that would be too much. Yeah because that's kind of"
04:56;05:03;"like five 12-hour days and then one 10-hour day on Saturday, Sunday off. All"
05:03;05:06;"right we can bang it out. We're gonna spread it out over like two weeks though."
05:06;05:12;"What's a topic that we could actually do a full year's worth of commentary on? The"
05:12;05:20;"dead? That would truly be the most psychotic time crisis thing ever. Just"
05:20;05:24;"like hey guys I actually feel like we've gone a little bit light on the dead in"
05:24;05:28;"the past few months. Although I'm sure if I look back there's probably a round of"
05:28;05:33;"every every episode. Pick up the pace. Yeah. We've been threatening to do a whole like kind of"
05:33;05:38;"guide to the Grateful Dead for a long time. This year we're really gonna go"
05:38;05:43;"deep. 2022 is Grateful Dead year. Every episode has something to do with the dead. But you"
05:43;05:48;"know classic time crisis fashion. We're gonna weave in some memories and corporate"
05:48;05:51;"food history. So it's something you could listen to with the whole family. You"
05:51;05:57;"don't have to be interested in the dead specifically. Maybe we could. What if we"
05:57;06:01;"open it up did like the whole history of rock music? That would require actual"
06:01;06:05;"organizing and work. We'll just go year by year. You know what we actually could"
06:05;06:13;"do? Actually that's kind of a cool idea. Ken Burns presents rock. I was gonna do Ken Burns rock."
06:13;06:21;"Is it just too funny? Just Peter Coyote narrating the story of rock. Oh is he the narrator of a lot of that stuff?"
06:21;06:26;"Peter Coyote? Peter Coyote is the narrator of a bunch of Ken Burns stuff. Oh wow."
06:26;06:31;"Notably the Vietnam doc. Jake I recently after we were hanging out the other day"
06:31;06:37;"I sent you a trailer for a UFO documentary not by Ken Burns but they"
06:37;06:41;"were smart to get Peter Coyote to be the narrator. So it gives it a bit of"
06:41;06:46;"gravitas. All right yeah I gotta check that out. Phenomenon. Highly recommended."
06:46;06:52;"I do love this this Ken Burns rock idea. I mean it would be Ken Burns rock and"
06:52;06:58;"roll but. Oh right. Ken Burns rock is. I just think there's Ken Burns jazz. So Ken"
06:58;07:06;"Burns rock. This American art form. This American art form forged in the"
07:06;07:12;"conflicts of the 1950s and 1960s. I could also see us doing like a year-by-year"
07:12;07:17;"thing where we're like all right we're doing 25 episodes this year it's gonna"
07:17;07:24;"be from 1970 to 1995. Each episode is one year. We just go super deep get Seinfeld"
07:24;07:27;"number crunch and giving us fun facts about that year. We could actually do"
07:27;07:30;"that. Two weeks. Actually that sounds pretty cool. All right everybody clear"
07:30;07:36;"your schedules we're doing two weeks corporate TC retreat in Scottsdale. Get a"
07:36;07:44;"little golfing. No time for that. Post up. We'll do one day a week. It's gonna be two weeks and we'll do"
07:44;07:48;"one day a week is golf day where we learn how to play golf. All right tell"
07:48;07:55;"the family we're going to Scottsdale. Let's do this thing. And let's do this"
07:55;07:57;"thing."
08:01;08:12;"I live five years if I take my time Ballin' that jack and drinkin' my wine"
08:12;08:23;"I've been shippin' them rocks from dawn till doom On my ride I hide my bottle in another room"
08:23;08:34;"Doctors say better stop ballin' that jack If I live five years I'm gonna bust my back"
08:34;08:36;"Yes I will"
08:36;08:44;"Easy win Cross the bayou today"
08:44;08:55;"'Cause there's a whole lot of women, mama Out in red on the streets today"
08:55;09:00;"It was good seeing everybody in person the other week out back in California for a little bit."
09:00;09:02;"Rock shows are back."
09:02;09:08;"Exactly, we had our only show of 2021 at the Outside Lands Festival."
09:08;09:10;"What did you guys open with?"
09:10;09:11;"Bambina."
09:11;09:14;"Cool, interesting choice."
09:14;09:17;"That's been a good opener in the FOTB era."
09:17;09:22;"Bayou designed an excellent set list, what was notable about the show."
09:22;09:24;"Bayou was like, ""This is the set list."""
09:24;09:26;"And you looked at it and you're like, ""Okay, cool."""
09:26;09:29;"That's been our go-to way for a while."
09:29;09:33;"Sometimes CT would throw it together, but in the last few years,"
09:33;09:37;"Bayou would put together a first draft, say, ""What do you think?"""
09:37;09:42;"We would chime in, and sometimes I might have strong feelings that I was really thinking,"
09:42;09:45;"""In this city, we should do this,"" or I've been wanting to do that."
09:45;09:49;"But he usually has very good instincts about the flow of the show"
09:49;09:55;"and what we haven't played in a while, making sure we're mixing it up night to night."
09:55;10:02;"Of course, in a 70-minute festival set, you don't have as much time to really dig in"
10:02;10:10;"as during our 2019 2.5 to 3-hour shows, where we're playing probably double the number of songs."
10:10;10:12;"This was a short but sweet, tight set."
10:12;10:17;"Made sure we played 2021, as it was our only show of 2021."
10:17;10:21;"Oh, and also, I don't know how this went down. It was a little bit hard to read."
10:21;10:24;"I mean, the audience was great. It was a huge crowd."
10:24;10:27;"Probably one of our bigger US festival crowds ever."
10:27;10:31;"It looked crazy. Just the little clips I saw on Instagram, I was like,"
10:31;10:32;"""Damn!"""
10:32;10:35;"The festival told us it was 50,000 people."
10:35;10:36;"Jeez Louise."
10:36;10:40;"After 30, you can't really tell from the stage, but there are 50."
10:40;10:42;"I was like, ""All right, damn."""
10:42;10:46;"But when we were all talking about it, the head of the show, Bale, said,"
10:46;10:51;"""I was thinking we could walk out to a 2021 instrumental, just to be a nod to the heads."
10:51;10:53;"This is our 2021 show."""
10:53;10:57;"I said, ""I'm with you, but can we spice it up somehow?"""
10:57;10:58;"He was like, ""All right, how?"""
10:58;11:01;"I said, ""Put a beat behind it."""
11:01;11:04;"Then I was thinking about something that was around the same tempo."
11:04;11:08;"I said, ""Could you mock up the 'We Will Rock You' stomps and claps,"
11:08;11:11;"and then have the 2021 thing come over it?"""
11:11;11:15;"Then two minutes later, literally, he was like, ""How about this?"""
11:15;11:18;"It was somewhere in between cringe and funny."
11:18;11:19;"[laughs]"
11:19;11:22;"So basically, we played it, and it was like..."
11:22;11:24;"[beatboxing]"
11:24;11:26;"Crowd started screaming, the lights changed."
11:26;11:29;"[beatboxing]"
11:29;11:37;"[humming]"
11:37;11:39;"[stomping]"
11:39;11:50;"[stomping]"
11:50;12:11;"[stomping]"
12:11;12:16;"So we walked out, and I don't know to what extent the crowd clocked that"
12:16;12:20;"we had done a ""We Will Rock You"" remix of our own song."
12:20;12:26;"But we walked out, and yeah, just kind of saw a pretty rock-heavy set"
12:26;12:28;"outside of 2021."
12:28;12:30;"Great to hear it was rock-heavy."
12:30;12:32;"[laughs]"
12:32;12:38;"It was like Bambina, Sunflower, our extended Black Sabbath version."
12:38;12:40;"Oh, wow. Okay, he brought it."
12:40;12:46;"Cousins, Holiday, Unbelievers, of course, A-Punk, Campus."
12:46;12:47;"Yeah."
12:47;12:49;"And with a big Walcott, real old school."
12:49;12:50;"Anyway, it was a great vibe."
12:50;12:52;"Did you do Harmony Hall?"
12:52;12:55;"Oh, yeah, Harmony Hall, of course, This Life."
12:55;12:56;"Yeah, it was a great vibe."
12:56;13:00;"I didn't know, leading up to it, it seemed so surreal,"
13:00;13:04;"especially because it's coming home to do this show."
13:04;13:07;"It sounded on paper kind of crazy, first show in 18 months."
13:07;13:11;"But then we rehearsed two days, and by the afternoon of the first day,"
13:11;13:12;"it felt pretty dialed in."
13:12;13:15;"It was like, ""Oh, yeah, these things don't go away."""
13:15;13:19;"In fact, I might even say that that was one of our better Sunflowers of all time,"
13:19;13:23;"specifically Brian Jones and CT, very locked in."
13:23;13:26;"I had a few notable [expletive] ups."
13:26;13:29;"I was playing the riff for 2021, and the first time I started playing it,"
13:29;13:33;"just that weird feeling where it's like, ""Oh, [expletive] I forget how it goes."""
13:33;13:35;"I got it back by the end."
13:35;13:37;"[singing]"
13:37;13:44;"Yeah, I think I was like, [singing]"
13:44;13:45;"That kind of thing."
13:45;13:47;"But, yeah, the band was very tight."
13:47;13:50;"I think it's one of those things, you know, when you're learning something new"
13:50;13:53;"and you rehearse and practice it a lot,"
13:53;13:56;"and you kind of reach a point where you're pretty good,"
13:56;13:58;"but you're not necessarily getting that much better,"
13:58;14:02;"and then you take some time off, and then weirdly it's stronger when you come back?"
14:02;14:03;"It's fresher."
14:03;14:06;"I think that happened a little bit with the band, minus my [expletive] ups."
14:06;14:10;"So, all in all, thanks to everybody who came out to Outside Lands."
14:10;14:12;"Always loved playing in the Bay Area."
14:12;14:15;"Great vibe. Great crowd."
14:15;14:20;"So it was short but sweet, but that was our 2021 tour, Outside Lands."
14:20;14:22;"[singing]"
14:25;14:46;"Were you, like, hella nervous before you went out?"
14:46;14:48;"I was pretty calm."
14:48;14:51;"I was in a good mood, very peaceful."
14:51;14:56;"And then, standing on the side of the stage, I felt like, ""Let's do this thing."""
14:56;14:59;"And then, as soon as we walked out and I saw all the people,"
14:59;15:02;"despite my mental calmness, my heart started beating faster."
15:02;15:05;"It took me a couple songs to kind of catch my breath."
15:05;15:09;"Also, like, singing, feeling like a little bit,"
15:09;15:12;"your heart starts beating and you gotta think, it's a little bit difficult."
15:12;15:17;"But then, yeah, after two or three songs, I felt pretty mellow and dialed in."
15:17;15:20;"When's the next Richard Pictures show?"
15:20;15:21;"Depends on the books."
15:21;15:24;"We were, like, gonna try to play some gigs this fall,"
15:24;15:26;"and then we just didn't get it together."
15:26;15:32;"Our drummer, Moe's, his wife had a baby, like, a month ago or two weeks ago or something."
15:32;15:34;"Well, congratulations."
15:34;15:38;"Shout out to Moe's and Jillian and their beautiful baby,"
15:38;15:40;"whose name I don't remember."
15:40;15:41;"But..."
15:41;15:43;"She's baby here."
15:43;15:47;"Too many moving parts, and we just, like, we're grateful to the cover band."
15:47;15:52;"We don't--we're fine. We don't need to stress ourselves out and push hard to, like,"
15:52;15:54;"""Get back out there!"""
15:54;15:55;"[laughter]"
15:55;15:59;"We'll get back out there on our own sketch."
15:59;16:00;"Music never stopped."
16:00;16:01;"No, man."
16:01;16:04;"Richard Pictures stopped playing for a while, but the music never stopped."
16:04;16:05;"They'll be back."
16:05;16:09;"I saw a friend of the show, Little Wings, play last night."
16:09;16:10;"Oh, yeah?"
16:10;16:13;"I've seen three concerts in the last, like, month."
16:13;16:18;"The first one I saw was ""Writers on the Doors,"" a ""The Doors"" tribute act."
16:18;16:21;"[laughter]"
16:21;16:25;"That was the first concert I'd seen, you know, since COVID started."
16:25;16:33;"And then I saw Vediver and Casey Johansson play out in Joshua Tree at Pappy and Harriet's."
16:33;16:36;"And then last night I was back at Permanent Roadhouse, great venue."
16:36;16:39;"I think we're going to play there a bunch next year, hopefully."
16:39;16:42;"I hadn't seen Kyle in two years."
16:42;16:43;"Whoa."
16:43;16:45;"I'd never saw him during the pandemic."
16:45;16:46;"Not even in person?"
16:46;16:48;"No, we never linked."
16:48;16:51;"We never, like, did, like, an outdoor socially distanced hang."
16:51;16:53;"This was a reunion in more ways than one."
16:53;16:54;"This was big."
16:54;16:56;"It was great to see him."
16:56;17:00;"Funny to see a band play that I've played a lot in."
17:00;17:07;"I kept wanting to rip some, like, kind solos of Little Wings songs."
17:07;17:09;"You were ripping some kind mental solos?"
17:09;17:11;"Exactly."
17:11;17:12;"Mental solos."
17:12;17:18;"♪ Hair it like a pounce upon a pico, look at what the light did now ♪"
17:18;17:24;"♪ Bear it like a bounce upon the beco, look at what the light did now ♪"
17:24;17:30;"♪ Land and water and bird or beast, oh, look at what the light did now ♪"
17:30;17:36;"♪ Shiny little band or golden fleece, oh, look at what the light did now ♪"
17:36;17:42;"♪ Look at what the light did now, look at what the light did now ♪"
17:42;17:46;"♪ Look at what the light did now ♪"
17:46;17:59;"[Humming]"
17:59;18:01;"So were all these shows outdoors?"
18:01;18:02;"Mm-hmm."
18:02;18:05;"Are you ready to just roll to an indoor concert?"
18:05;18:09;"I have tickets to Ween on Saturday at the Wiltern."
18:09;18:10;"Oh, okay."
18:10;18:13;"So that's like show your Vax Card style indoors."
18:13;18:16;"I'm a little trepidatious, but I'm going to go."
18:16;18:19;"Well, I'll tell you once the OXYGO goes."
18:19;18:22;"I just haven't heard about, like, there's been all sorts of indoor concerts"
18:22;18:24;"where people present Vax Cards."
18:24;18:25;"Oh, yeah, of course."
18:25;18:29;"I haven't heard anything that's like, that Foo Fighters show was a super spreader event."
18:29;18:34;"Wait, so what's the, uh, do you have to wear a mask in California right now?"
18:34;18:35;"I don't know."
18:35;18:37;"Indoors? I don't know."
18:37;18:43;"I went to a show at Largo and present your Vax Cards, everyone has to wear a mask."
18:43;18:44;"So you were seated at Largo?"
18:44;18:46;"I was seated at Largo."
18:46;18:48;"And I mean, obviously, like, I'm pretty freaked out."
18:48;18:51;"I've been, it was like the first time I've done anything."
18:51;18:52;"Mm-hmm."
18:52;18:55;"And it was an indoor event, but it was definitely felt very safe."
18:55;18:57;"I'm sure it was fine, but I don't think it'll rock."
18:57;19:02;"I don't, I don't think at an actual concert people sitting up, anybody's wearing masks."
19:02;19:03;"Yeah, I kind of doubt it."
19:03;19:07;"Do you have a sense, Nick, was that a California law or a Largo law?"
19:07;19:09;"I think it's a Largo law."
19:09;19:15;"And I think it was also probably mainly enforced by the person performing."
19:15;19:21;"Like, I know that she really, uh, it was that Jacqueline Novak show, Get On Your Knees."
19:21;19:22;"Oh, okay."
19:22;19:25;"And I know that she's, and I know she's like very much everyone wearing a mask."
19:25;19:26;"A masker?"
19:26;19:27;"She's a masker."
19:27;19:31;"Did you at least point out that your constitutional rights were being violated?"
19:31;19:33;"Yeah, when I walked in, I told everybody."
19:33;19:34;"Loudly."
19:35;19:36;"In the middle of the show."
19:36;19:37;"All right."
19:37;19:38;"As long as you're-"
19:38;19:39;"You went full Walter Subcheck."
19:39;19:40;"This is about our rights, man."
19:40;19:42;"This affects us all."
19:42;19:51;"I'm guessing, unless it's like some crazy law and the venue is like religiously enforcing it,"
19:51;19:55;"I'm guessing at a Wien show, the vast majority will not be wearing masks."
19:55;19:56;"I agree."
19:56;19:59;"And so, you know, are you going to rock a mask the whole time?"
19:59;20:01;"Just being like stared at by Wien fans?"
20:01;20:03;"I'm going to take the temperature of the room."
20:03;20:10;"Oh, do you think you'll see some people wearing masks with the Wien guy on the mask?"
20:10;20:11;"The Wien guy?"
20:11;20:12;"I'm sure."
20:12;20:13;"100%."
20:13;20:16;"Does the Wien guy have a name?"
20:16;20:17;"That's a good question."
20:17;20:18;"I feel like he should."
20:18;20:19;"The Wien guy."
20:19;20:24;"That's going to be really tough if you're like an anti-mask Wien fan,"
20:24;20:26;"which I'm sure there are quite a few of,"
20:26;20:30;"because you'll roll up and see somebody wearing a mask and you'll be shaking your head,"
20:30;20:37;"but then you'll see it's got the Wien guy on it and you'll be like, ""Respect, but not cool."""
20:37;20:39;"I mean..."
20:39;20:41;"I just want to keep doing Hulk Hogan now."
20:41;20:42;"Respect, brother."
20:42;20:44;"The Wien official..."
20:44;20:45;"Respect."
20:45;20:52;"The official Wien online store sells a Wien mask with the Wien guy on it that says,"
20:52;20:54;"""Please don't let me die."""
20:54;20:55;"Oh, nice."
20:55;20:58;"""Am I going to see God, Mommy?"
20:58;21:00;"Please don't let me die."""
21:00;21:03;"The lyric from Spinal Meningitis."
21:03;21:06;"Very tasteful."
21:06;21:09;"You know, I don't think the Wien guy has..."
21:09;21:13;"The Wien guy I don't think has a name."
21:13;21:15;"That's interesting."
21:15;21:17;"There's no Steely or whatever."
21:17;21:18;"Yeah, there's no..."
21:18;21:21;"The Iron Maiden guy is named Eddie."
21:21;21:22;"Right, right."
21:22;21:24;"Is this true?"
21:24;21:28;"Matt just texted me saying, ""Is it Boognish?"""
21:28;21:29;"Oh, right."
21:29;21:30;"Okay, that rings a bell."
21:30;21:31;"Boognish?"
21:31;21:32;"Boognish."
21:32;21:33;"I didn't know that guy was called..."
21:33;21:35;"Is he called Boognish or The Boognish?"
21:35;21:38;"Well, Boognish is a Wien song."
21:38;21:39;"Yeah."
21:39;21:42;"That makes sense that he'd be called Boognish."
21:42;21:44;"Just rolling up to a mask wearer at a Wien show."
21:44;21:47;"How dare you, disgrace Boognish."
21:47;21:48;"Ooh, okay."
21:48;21:49;"Matt, throw in Boognish."
21:49;21:50;"Okay."
21:50;21:53;"So, according from Wien's Wikipedia,"
21:53;21:56;"from Wien's earliest days, they claim to be, quote,"
21:56;21:59;"""sprouted from the demon god Boognish."""
21:59;22:02;"The image of the Boognish is the band's logo."
22:02;22:03;"Okay."
22:03;22:05;"That's the Boognish."
22:05;22:08;"Oh, so it's a very important part of their mythology."
22:08;22:09;"Yes."
22:09;22:10;"Their origin story."
22:20;22:30;"[applause]"
23:15;23:17;"All right, guys."
23:17;23:18;"All right."
23:18;23:21;"I'm seeing major label potential written all over these guys."
23:21;23:23;"[laughter]"
23:23;23:25;"That's like the earliest Wien?"
23:25;23:26;"I guess so."
23:26;23:27;"I've never heard that."
23:27;23:30;"Maybe most Wien fans don't know that the face is called Boognish,"
23:30;23:33;"but it's a great conversation starter if you ever see that face"
23:33;23:36;"roll up to somebody and say, ""Sweet Boognish,"""
23:36;23:38;"and see how they react."
23:38;23:40;"Sweet Boognish, brother."
23:40;23:42;"[laughter]"
23:42;23:44;"Sorry, this is so dumb."
23:44;23:47;"I like the idea of Hulk Hogan going to a Wien show."
23:47;23:49;"That actually kind of makes sense."
23:49;23:51;"Kind of tracks."
24:01;24:11;"[applause]"
24:41;24:55;"[applause]"
24:55;24:57;"Over the last five years,"
24:57;25:03;"Alec, a.k.a. Despot, has clocked quite a few TC hours."
25:03;25:06;"It's not enough to be FAA certified,"
25:06;25:10;"but eventually we're going to have a whole fleet of captains"
25:10;25:14;"ready to step in at a moment's notice with full TC training."
25:14;25:22;"I think right now only me, Nick, Seinfeld, and Jake"
25:22;25:24;"have clocked enough hours,"
25:24;25:27;"but eventually we'll have a few more people ready to go."
25:27;25:29;"All right, let's get Despot on the horn."
25:29;25:32;"He's going to talk to us about the McRib NFT."
25:32;25:36;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
25:36;25:39;"[beeping]"
25:39;25:41;"Jake, you're going to Wien."
25:41;25:43;"Also, when I was back in LA,"
25:43;25:46;"I went with CT to see fish at the Santa Barbara Bowl."
25:46;25:47;"Oh, right."
25:47;25:48;"Excellent show."
25:48;25:50;"You told me about that. It sounded fun."
25:50;25:59;"I talked to a guy who said that he had been to 256 fish shows or something."
25:59;26:00;"Wow."
26:00;26:05;"He said that the Santa Barbara show, they took it to another level."
26:05;26:07;"Whoa."
26:07;26:10;"I mean, this is from a real head."
26:10;26:13;"Really? I mean, I did have a feeling in the second set."
26:13;26:18;"I was kind of jet lagged, and I kind of closed my eyes."
26:18;26:21;"They got into some pretty heady jams in the second set."
26:21;26:25;"As it got dark, I was very impressed, and it was a fun set."
26:25;26:29;"A few classics, a bunch of new stuff."
26:29;26:33;"I realized that actually I know their last album, Sigma Oasis, very well,"
26:33;26:38;"and I was happy to hear a few of those songs, called the song ""The Lizards."""
26:38;26:40;"Any of you guys know ""The Lizards""?"
26:40;26:41;"I don't know that one."
26:41;26:43;"Alec, do you know any fish songs?"
26:43;26:46;"No, not even ""The Lizards."""
26:46;26:47;"[laughs]"
26:47;26:52;"Wait, but could you name a few Grateful Dead songs?"
26:52;26:53;"""Fire on the Mountain."""
26:53;26:54;"Oh, yeah. There you go."
26:54;26:55;"Boom."
26:55;26:56;"[bleep]"
26:56;26:58;"What's the other one?"
26:58;27:01;"""Driving That Train High on Cocaine."" You know that one?"
27:01;27:03;"We talked about that one."
27:03;27:05;"I don't know, man. Not really a Deadhead."
27:05;27:07;"What about their big hit from the '80s?"
27:07;27:09;"I don't know their big hit from the '80s."
27:09;27:11;"♪ I will get by ♪"
27:11;27:13;"♪ Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun ♪"
27:13;27:17;"I have heard that song. Is it called ""I Will Get By""?"
27:17;27:19;"[laughs]"
27:19;27:22;"No. ""Touch."" ""Touch of."""
27:22;27:24;"""The Grateful Dead."""
27:24;27:28;"♪ Every silver lining's got a ♪"
27:28;27:31;"♪ Touch of dead ♪"
27:31;27:34;"That's when they came back in the '80s, ""Touch of the Grateful Dead."""
27:34;27:35;"Reintroducing--"
27:35;27:37;"I remember that."
27:37;27:38;"I was young, but--"
27:38;27:40;"So you can't name a single Fish song?"
27:40;27:42;"Oh, no way."
27:42;27:49;"I like drugs, though, and a lot of the people that give me drugs are fish guys and Deadheads,"
27:49;27:52;"and that's how you know the drugs are good."
27:52;27:53;"You got that drug connection."
27:53;27:55;"Yeah, I have a drug connection."
27:55;27:57;"Is that a Fish song?"
27:57;27:59;"[laughs]"
27:59;28:02;"I feel like they do have a song with drugs in the title."
28:02;28:04;"It was kind of funny leaving Santa Barbara."
28:04;28:08;"There wasn't-- The Santa Barbara Bowl is, like, right in town."
28:08;28:12;"It's not like an amphitheater that's, like, out in the middle of nowhere."
28:12;28:16;"So I think they have pretty strict rules about the volume and the curfew."
28:16;28:21;"It's a relatively quiet place, but it was totally fine."
28:21;28:26;"But also that means-- It's not like there's, like, a big parking lot, like, right on site."
28:26;28:31;"And I think the city has ordinances about, like, if you're allowed to post up and sell stuff."
28:31;28:33;"So it wasn't much of a lot scene."
28:33;28:37;"One thing we thought was pretty funny is, like, when we were walking to the venue,"
28:37;28:41;"there was a guy-- And I don't know if this was, like, code for drugs,"
28:41;28:44;"but there was a guy holding a big tray of baklava, and he was just like,"
28:44;28:50;"""Get your baklava. Come on, I know you want some baklava. Come on, man."""
28:50;28:54;"If he actually had baklava, though, then maybe he was just selling baklava."
28:54;28:57;"I mean, he did have baklava. I don't know if when you actually go up to him, he's like,"
28:57;29:03;"""All right, man, baklava. One triangle baklava, 40 bucks."""
29:03;29:08;"And you're like, ""Great deal."" And then he hands you--"
29:08;29:12;"But he was there on the way in and out, so maybe he really was just, like--"
29:12;29:17;"That seems like kind of, like, fish-wing type humor to just roll up to the show selling baklava."
29:19;29:23;"I sang through the corridor, I came upon an aging knight"
29:23;29:26;"Who leaned against the wall in army armor"
29:26;29:30;"He was on his way to see the king"
29:30;29:38;"Wilson, Wilson, Wilson"
29:38;29:41;"He led me through the streets of Prussia talking"
29:41;29:46;"As he tried to crush a bug that scurried underneath his boot heel"
29:46;29:52;"He said there was a place where we should go"
29:52;29:55;"So we led him through the forest to the edge of a lagoon"
29:55;30:00;"By which we wandered till we reached above the spring"
30:00;30:04;"The night grew very quiet as we stood there"
30:04;30:09;"He lifted up his visor and he turned to me and he began to sing"
30:09;30:11;"He said, ""I come from the land of darkness"""
30:11;30:13;"He said, ""I come from the land of doom"""
30:13;30:15;"He said, ""I come from the land of damage"""
30:15;30:17;"He said, ""I come from the land of the big baboon"""
30:17;30:19;"""But I'm never ever going back there"""
30:19;30:21;"""And I couldn't if I tried"""
30:21;30:23;"""Cause I come from the land of lizards"""
30:23;30:25;"""And the lizards, they have died"""
30:31;30:35;"Well, Deadspot, great to have you back on the program."
30:35;30:36;"Great to be here."
30:36;30:41;"The first thing we want to talk about with you, the McRib NFT."
30:41;30:44;"I saw that. I saw the McDonald's tweet about it."
30:44;30:47;"And it's like a shiny spinning McRib or something, right?"
30:47;30:49;"I believe so."
30:49;30:53;"And this is to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the McRib."
30:53;30:55;"It was introduced to the McDonald's menu in '81,"
30:55;30:58;"but due to low sales, it was removed in '85."
30:58;30:59;"It's appeared on and off since."
30:59;31:01;"I didn't realize that at all."
31:01;31:03;"Were you a McRib fan?"
31:03;31:07;"I think I've only ever had one, and no, I can't say I was a fan."
31:07;31:09;"I may have only ever had one, too."
31:09;31:11;"People get excited about you."
31:11;31:12;"Yeah, people get really excited."
31:12;31:14;"You know, Jake, I'm sure I've asked you this before"
31:14;31:16;"because we've talked about McRibs many times,"
31:16;31:19;"but what's your take on the McRib?"
31:19;31:21;"We know they loomed large in your childhood."
31:21;31:23;"Right, we've definitely covered it."
31:23;31:25;"What's your personal take?"
31:25;31:29;"I don't think I've had one in 30 years."
31:29;31:32;"I don't feel comfortable weighing in."
31:32;31:36;"I don't think I would like it because it's like reconstituted."
31:36;31:40;"It's a reconstituted patty of rib meat,"
31:40;31:42;"something you should be eating off a bone."
31:42;31:43;"Yeah, true."
31:43;31:45;"That sounds troubling."
31:45;31:46;"I will say this, though."
31:46;31:51;"I did have my first Big Mac in probably 15 years,"
31:51;31:53;"about a week ago."
31:53;31:54;"Impulse move."
31:54;31:55;"All right, break it down."
31:55;31:57;"What was happening?"
31:57;32:00;"Hannah and I were driving back from the desert, back to LA."
32:00;32:02;"We left at a weird time of day."
32:02;32:04;"We were kind of hungry."
32:04;32:06;"We knew we'd get into traffic and be really hungry."
32:06;32:11;"Saw Mickey D's, pulled in, and just got some a la carte items."
32:11;32:13;"Did not get a value meal."
32:13;32:14;"I like that."
32:14;32:17;"I think that's a good way to go to McDonald's."
32:17;32:18;"Were you starving when you ate it?"
32:18;32:20;"The meal is crazy."
32:20;32:22;"Or were you planning on being starving?"
32:22;32:24;"I was headed towards starving."
32:24;32:26;"It was a little bit preemptive,"
32:26;32:30;"but we were maybe 40 minutes out from truly starving."
32:30;32:34;"You got in the car knowing you had a two, two and a half hour drive ahead of you."
32:34;32:35;"Correct."
32:35;32:36;"You were starving."
32:36;32:39;"There must have been some flicker in your mind about where are we going to stop."
32:39;32:40;"Right."
32:40;32:43;"As we were sort of rolling down the hill, getting towards the interstate,"
32:43;32:45;"just sort of like, ""Okay, what's the move here?"
32:45;32:46;"Are we just going to eat a Clif Bar?"
32:46;32:47;"What are we feeling?"""
32:47;32:49;"You set yourself up for it."
32:49;32:54;"You kind of maybe somewhere in there, you wanted a Big Mac."
32:54;32:56;"You knew that this maybe was coming."
32:56;33:00;"I surprised myself when I heard the words coming out of my mouth."
33:00;33:03;"I was like, ""Wow, I just ordered a Big Mac."
33:03;33:04;"Let's see how this goes."""
33:04;33:05;"I have to say it was great."
33:05;33:07;"What were the other options?"
33:07;33:09;"Eat it while driving."
33:09;33:11;"Didn't eat in the parking lot with the car in park."
33:11;33:16;"It was full, like 75 miles on the interstate."
33:16;33:20;"Left hand on steering wheel, right hand on the Big Mac with the box"
33:20;33:23;"kind of like balanced precariously on my lap"
33:23;33:26;"and like the lettuce kind of falling all over the floor."
33:26;33:29;"Yeah, I was about to say, you're going to be finding a little shredded lettuce"
33:29;33:32;"in the bottom of the car for a while."
33:32;33:35;"Special sauce on the steering wheel."
33:35;33:37;"A little bit of that greasy special."
33:37;33:38;"The special sauce was great."
33:38;33:42;"I did hit the floor of the van with a shop vac when we got back."
33:42;33:43;"Okay."
33:43;33:44;"Yeah."
33:44;33:47;"Wait, I'm sorry, but I got to understand."
33:47;33:48;"You're on the highway."
33:48;33:50;"There must have been many options."
33:50;33:53;"Did you see things go by like a Panera, this and that?"
33:53;33:54;"No, no, no, sorry."
33:54;33:55;"We were getting to the highway."
33:55;33:59;"We were like leaving Joshua Tree area."
33:59;34:03;"Oh, so it's kind of like last food for a while."
34:03;34:06;"Yeah, it wasn't like let's cruise on the highway and get off the highway."
34:06;34:09;"It was like we're about to get on the freeway,"
34:09;34:11;"probably get in a little Sunday afternoon traffic."
34:11;34:14;"Let's nip this in the bud."
34:14;34:18;"I didn't know if there was an Arnold Palmer available on the McDonald's menu"
34:18;34:22;"and I asked them and they said, I'll make you one."
34:22;34:26;"And if I could have tipped the McDonald's workers to the drive-thru,"
34:26;34:28;"I would have because it worked out great."
34:28;34:29;"You can't."
34:29;34:30;"You think they refuse your money?"
34:30;34:31;"It just felt weird."
34:31;34:33;"I mean, because you pay in the one window."
34:33;34:34;"It's whatever."
34:34;34:35;"It's boring."
34:35;34:36;"It's you know, you're paying with your card."
34:36;34:38;"It's just, yeah, I don't know if you can."
34:38;34:39;"That's a good question."
34:39;34:43;"Can you I mean, if you were at the counter, yeah, you could like paying cash."
34:43;34:48;"I don't think there's like a tip on a card transaction at McDonald's."
34:48;34:50;"All right, especially if you're doing it with a card."
34:50;34:51;"Yeah."
34:51;34:54;"Yeah, as you're as you pulled up to say,"
34:54;34:58;"I'm not exactly sure who made me that Arnold Palmer."
34:58;35:04;"But if you could just go check and give me their crypto wallet address."
35:04;35:06;"Wait, is that the right terminology?"
35:06;35:07;"Address?"
35:07;35:09;"Yeah, it's an address."
35:09;35:12;"If you can just give me their crypto wallet address,"
35:12;35:16;"I'll be blessing them with a McRib NFT shortly."
35:16;35:21;"I'll send them point zero zero zero zero one of a Bitcoin."
35:21;35:24;"That's not bad."
35:24;35:26;"I think how many zeros?"
35:26;35:27;"Might be all right."
35:27;35:31;"I'll send them one one hundred thousandth of a Bitcoin."
35:31;35:34;"One Jake Longstreth NFT."
35:34;35:37;"It's NFT week here in New York."
35:37;35:42;"It is against McDonald's policy to tip or to accept tips."
35:42;35:43;"Terrible policy."
35:43;35:45;"Come on, McDonald's."
35:45;35:46;"What people get tipped."
35:46;35:47;"Come on."
35:47;35:49;"It's food service for Christ's sake."
35:49;35:50;"Couldn't hurt."
35:50;35:53;"I am McDonald's rich, hundred grand, flick a wrist,"
35:53;35:56;"be stimulated, stimulated, hit a lick, hit a lick."
35:56;35:59;"I am McDonald's rich, hundred grand, flick a wrist,"
35:59;36:02;"hit a lick, hit a lick, flick a wrist, flick a wrist."
36:02;36:05;"I am McDonald's rich, hundred grand, flick a wrist,"
36:05;36:08;"hit a lick, hit a lick, stimulated, stimulated."
36:08;36:11;"I am McDonald's rich, hundred grand, best gift,"
36:11;36:14;"hit a lick, hit a lick, stimulated, stimulated."
36:14;36:17;"I am Yaki Yamamoto with the flex."
36:17;36:20;"I am Coca-Cola with the chips."
36:20;36:23;"With the mother of flex soda with the reps."
36:23;36:26;"I am mother of Fyodor with the text."
36:26;36:30;"I don't mean to call her bitch, but she bad though."
36:30;36:31;"Facts though."
36:31;36:33;"I've been lit since Kermit was a tadpole."
36:33;36:34;"Mad though."
36:34;36:35;"Flames though."
36:35;36:36;"Shopping at the back though."
36:36;36:37;"Natural."
36:37;36:39;"Only chill, 'cause it's in my trap though."
36:39;36:40;"Back to NFTs."
36:40;36:42;"It's NFT week in New York."
36:42;36:44;"So Alec, what--"
36:44;36:47;"Have you been involved in NFTs from the jump?"
36:47;36:50;"I know you know a thing or two about crypto,"
36:50;36:54;"but like, NFTs, like, what's your personal history with them?"
36:54;36:57;"I have no real personal history with NFTs."
36:57;36:59;"I'm aware of them."
36:59;37:01;"I understand how they work."
37:01;37:03;"I've never owned one."
37:03;37:05;"They're really dumb to me."
37:05;37:09;"I understand that people are tricking other people"
37:09;37:12;"in these very big ways and making a lot of money,"
37:12;37:14;"and I guess that's cool."
37:14;37:19;"But, I mean, it's like, I've had a pretty bad experience here"
37:19;37:22;"with crypto/NFT week or whatever."
37:22;37:23;"Wait."
37:23;37:26;"What does NFT week entail?"
37:26;37:29;"There's all these raves and, like, big-ass parties,"
37:29;37:32;"and these parties are being thrown by basically, like, kids"
37:32;37:36;"who have hundreds of millions of dollars, I guess,"
37:36;37:39;"or at least tens of millions that they just made"
37:39;37:41;"in, like, ten minutes or whatever."
37:41;37:42;"Right."
37:42;37:44;"And it's, like, these dorks."
37:44;37:50;"Like, I mean, so I went to a rave, I guess, the other night,"
37:50;37:56;"and it was a coin called Friends With Benefits, FWB coin."
37:56;37:59;"A new coin? Like, this is the launch?"
37:59;38:02;"No, it's, like, a new-ish coin, but I guess it's been around."
38:02;38:05;"I never heard of it until I went to this rave."
38:05;38:07;"This rave was a block away from my house."
38:07;38:10;"I was just walking home, and then I see this rave,"
38:10;38:12;"and people I know were there."
38:12;38:16;"People I know played, like, Caroline Polachek DJed,"
38:16;38:22;"and this girl Daz DJed, and this kid Paliq Moll performed."
38:22;38:24;"Whatever."
38:24;38:26;"So I go to the thing because it's on my way home,"
38:26;38:28;"and it's, like, this big thing."
38:28;38:30;"I don't know how to describe--like, I don't know."
38:30;38:34;"I go to a lot of things, shows, parties, whatever."
38:34;38:38;"I never feel weird being at one or walking in."
38:38;38:40;"I don't know if I don't know anybody or whatever,"
38:40;38:44;"but I don't know if these particular people are, like, people that--"
38:44;38:48;"I've maybe only seen people who look like that and act like that"
38:48;38:52;"in, like, weird--like, made-for-TV movies or something."
38:52;38:54;"Like, I don't know."
38:54;38:56;"I just felt very weird."
38:56;38:58;"Because they're--"
38:58;39:00;"Like Silicon Valley?"
39:00;39:01;"No."
39:01;39:03;"Like that TV movie from the '90s that was, like,"
39:03;39:05;"Steve Jobs versus Bill Gates?"
39:05;39:07;"Maybe, but the new version of that"
39:07;39:10;"where they're wearing, like, Nike Tech sweats"
39:10;39:17;"and, like, everyone has a bag strapped across them or whatever."
39:17;39:19;"Like, one of those."
39:19;39:22;"True, like, neo-rave crypto culture."
39:22;39:25;"But that sounds like a pretty good lineup."
39:25;39:27;"But that's what I'm saying."
39:27;39:30;"Like, there is so much money."
39:30;39:32;"So, like, last night there was a show"
39:32;39:36;"at a not very big venue in Brooklyn called Brooklyn Steel,"
39:36;39:39;"and the show was ""Lil Baby"" and ""The Strokes."""
39:39;39:41;"What the hell is that?"
39:41;39:43;"[laughing]"
39:43;39:45;"Wait, who threw it?"
39:45;39:49;"So I'm, like, a kid who probably just made $10 million yesterday"
39:49;39:52;"and was like, ""I'll f---ing pay 'The Strokes' $2 million"
39:52;39:56;"and 'Lil Baby' $2 million and have a show in this--"
39:56;39:59;"You know, what is that? Like a 1,000-cap venue?"
39:59;40:01;"2,000? I don't know. Whatever it is."
40:01;40:04;"Brooklyn Steel's, like, yeah, $1,800 maybe?"
40:04;40:07;"Right, but, I mean, that's not ""Lil Baby"" and ""The Strokes"" size."
40:07;40:10;"And I guess that's the idea here,"
40:10;40:13;"is that these guys could do whatever they want."
40:13;40:16;"They all have, like, $100,000 watches on,"
40:16;40:18;"and they're just these dorks."
40:18;40:20;"And then my experience at the party,"
40:20;40:23;"there's all these people coming up to me"
40:23;40:25;"telling me that they knew me."
40:25;40:27;"They were like, ""I don't know what's going on there."
40:27;40:29;"Something's weird. This one guy was, like--"
40:29;40:32;"We used to hang out all the time nine years ago,"
40:32;40:34;"and I was like, ""I have no idea who you are."""
40:34;40:37;"And there's no way we used to hang out all the time nine years ago"
40:37;40:40;"'cause I know people I hung out with nine years ago."
40:40;40:42;"It felt like it was some kind of tactic"
40:42;40:45;"'cause it wasn't just-- It's [bleep] like that kept happening."
40:45;40:47;"Like, I didn't-- I don't know."
40:47;40:49;"Is it possible that having all these, like,"
40:49;40:52;"powerful tech lords in one place"
40:52;40:54;"maybe opened up the multiverse?"
40:54;40:55;"Maybe."
40:55;40:58;"It's very possible that those people"
40:58;41:00;"in their dimension"
41:00;41:02;"actually did know you nine years ago."
41:02;41:04;"I guess I didn't consider that."
41:04;41:06;"They did look--"
41:06;41:08;"Some of the people who were saying those things"
41:08;41:12;"looked like they possibly came from somewhere else."
41:12;41:15;"There was some that were, like, the dorky,"
41:15;41:17;"you know, cross-strap bag guy,"
41:17;41:20;"and then there was, like, the Mad Max guys."
41:20;41:22;"There was, like, a guy was, like--"
41:22;41:24;"You know, they looked like Mad Max guys."
41:24;41:27;"-Really? -Well, like, Mohawks and, like--"
41:27;41:30;"Yeah, like that kind of [bleep] like steampunk almost."
41:30;41:32;"I don't know what was going on in there."
41:32;41:34;"You're definitely in a different timeline."
41:34;41:35;"Wow."
41:35;41:37;"We picked the right name for this show, ""Time Crisis,"""
41:37;41:39;"'cause I truly think we're all speaking to each other"
41:39;41:41;"from different timelines."
41:41;41:44;"'Cause, honestly, in the timeline that I've been living in,"
41:44;41:46;"NFTs aren't that big of a deal."
41:46;41:48;"There's no such thing as NFT week."
41:48;41:51;"They weren't a big deal until this week,"
41:51;41:53;"and I don't know."
41:53;41:54;"What the hell?"
41:54;41:57;"Wait, sorry. Is NFT week real?"
41:57;41:58;"Is that a real thing?"
41:58;42:00;"Yeah, there's, like, conferences--"
42:00;42:03;"In his timeline, in Alex's timeline, it is real, Jake."
42:03;42:05;"You have to expand your concept of what's real"
42:05;42:07;"when we're talking about the multiverse,"
42:07;42:11;"because real, not real, these are relative ideas."
42:11;42:14;"There was one in Miami, apparently, right before this."
42:14;42:18;"And so the guy who put on the ""Brooklyn Steel"" show"
42:18;42:20;"that made $10 million yesterday,"
42:20;42:23;"is he a guy that minted NFTs"
42:23;42:29;"that he then sold to other NFT enthusiasts for mad cash?"
42:29;42:31;"I think that's what's happening,"
42:31;42:34;"and I guess, like, a lot of these keep on getting uncovered as scams."
42:34;42:36;"Like, there was one that just happened."
42:36;42:39;"I think it was called ""Monkey [bleep]."""
42:39;42:42;"And it was a guy who did--"
42:42;42:47;"a guy who, like, created the ""Monkey [bleep]"" series of NFTs."
42:47;42:50;"'Cause these are-- you know, there's, like, crypto punks,"
42:50;42:52;"there's apes, there's whatever."
42:52;42:53;"-Yeah. -And it's all, like,"
42:53;42:56;"just very bad cartoon art."
42:56;42:58;"Oh, it's the worst-looking [bleep] ever."
42:58;43:01;"It's so-- it's, like, embarrassingly bad."
43:01;43:02;"That's the other thing, is, like,"
43:02;43:04;"at least make the things look cool or something,"
43:04;43:07;"or make them, like, stupid enough that they're cool."
43:07;43:09;"-They're not even stupid enough. -Okay, well, all right."
43:09;43:12;"So I think me and probably a few of our listeners"
43:12;43:14;"who maybe live in alternate timelines"
43:14;43:16;"need a little bit of clarification,"
43:16;43:18;"'cause to some people,"
43:18;43:20;"depending on where they first heard about NFTs,"
43:20;43:22;"it might have been presented to them as,"
43:22;43:24;"""Well, NFTs are digital art."
43:24;43:27;"So you have real artists creating real art."
43:27;43:29;"Yeah, you can't hold it in your hands."
43:29;43:32;"Maybe you don't agree with the value,"
43:32;43:34;"but these are real artists creating real art,"
43:34;43:37;"but they're doing it digitally, and this is, like, the future."""
43:37;43:39;"And then you have these corporations"
43:39;43:41;"kind of doing these cheeky things,"
43:41;43:43;"like a McRib NFT or Taco Bell NFTs."
43:43;43:47;"But generally, it seemed like the concept was--"
43:47;43:48;"or, like, NBA NFTs."
43:48;43:51;"Like, it's either it's art or it's collectible."
43:51;43:54;"And that, I think, most people could wrap their head around."
43:54;43:57;"But now you're talking about, like, scams."
43:57;44:01;"So is that because people are only buying it?"
44:01;44:04;"Like, you can't really get scammed with art, you know?"
44:04;44:06;"Either you like it or you don't."
44:06;44:08;"I don't totally understand,"
44:08;44:10;"but I think what happens is, like,"
44:10;44:13;"""Okay, I'm the guy who made CryptoPunks,"
44:13;44:15;"and you buy CryptoPunk,"
44:15;44:17;"and a hundred other people buy CryptoPunks,"
44:17;44:21;"and now there's millions of dollars invested in CryptoPunks."
44:21;44:26;"And then I guess I have access to whatever,"
44:26;44:29;"like that money or something?"""
44:29;44:34;"'Cause you're basically storing your ether in my NFT,"
44:34;44:36;"and then you can sell it or whatever."
44:36;44:40;"But I could also just run away with all the NFTs and disappear,"
44:40;44:43;"which apparently has happened a bunch of times already."
44:43;44:45;"'Cause, like, I could just be, like, you know,"
44:45;44:47;"the monkey-[bleep] guy."
44:47;44:49;"I could be like, ""Here, I made monkey-[bleep]"
44:49;44:51;"Everybody buy some. It's blowing up."""
44:51;44:54;"And then people are like, ""Sure, here's $10,000 for a monkey-[bleep]"""
44:54;44:58;"You can literally get, like, lose your money."
44:58;45:01;"I mean, I'm sure also, just like there's scams in the real art world"
45:01;45:05;"where somebody could get a couple journalists and a few phone calls,"
45:05;45:08;"and you could hype up some artist that nobody really cares about"
45:08;45:11;"and then convince somebody to pay top dollar."
45:11;45:16;"Yeah, they get people to bid stuff up at auctions, stuff like that."
45:16;45:19;"That's a different situation than what Alex is describing."
45:19;45:21;"You're describing outright theft."
45:21;45:25;"If you bought an overhyped painting that then sold for much less"
45:25;45:27;"at an auction a year later,"
45:27;45:29;"everyone understands that, like,"
45:29;45:31;"""Okay, yeah, you took a risk. Didn't work out."""
45:31;45:34;"It's like buying a stock for a tech company that took a nosedive."
45:34;45:37;"What you're describing sounds different."
45:37;45:38;"Yeah, it seems like there's--"
45:38;45:39;"Straight-up theft."
45:39;45:42;"Outright theft, yeah. I think that's happening."
45:42;45:45;"Don't quote me on it, or do, I don't care."
45:45;45:47;"I heard that, too."
45:47;45:50;"But I was wondering the same thing about, like, how--"
45:50;45:54;"Even aside from the theft, I mean, I guess in the art world,"
45:54;45:56;"you're some rich collector,"
45:56;46:00;"somebody convinces you to buy an artist, the value tanks,"
46:00;46:04;"you're already loaded, you probably say win some, lose some, all good."
46:04;46:06;"But I guess with NFTs,"
46:06;46:09;"you probably have people trying to jump into the NFT world"
46:09;46:11;"who don't particularly have a lot of money."
46:11;46:13;"So this is like a combination of the art world"
46:13;46:16;"and Wolf of Wall Street, like, penny stocks."
46:16;46:19;"That's my-- This is my other issue."
46:19;46:23;"I have a friend, like a sort of peripheral friend,"
46:23;46:25;"who I met in, like,"
46:25;46:29;"when all this crazy GameStop stock sh*t was happening,"
46:29;46:33;"these guys I know formed a group chat with all these other people"
46:33;46:35;"who were investing in that, and I made some money on that."
46:35;46:36;"That was fun, but--"
46:36;46:40;"And, like, I didn't know anything about the stock market, but whatever."
46:40;46:44;"Now, like, the chat has shifted a little to, like, crypto and NFTs and stuff,"
46:44;46:46;"and I'm like, ""Man, you guys-- I don't know."
46:46;46:48;"You guys sound crazy."""
46:48;46:52;"And my problem is, like, if you're doing this dumb sh*t"
46:52;46:55;"that is just objectively dumb, like, it's f*cking dumb."
46:55;46:59;"But I get that, like, maybe there are opportunities"
46:59;47:02;"to, like, do something else with it that is less dumb,"
47:02;47:04;"but not so much of that is happening yet."
47:04;47:07;"If you're doing this and you're trying to sell me on it,"
47:07;47:10;"and I'm like, ""Okay, are you rich?"
47:10;47:12;"Like, where is your millions of dollars?"""
47:12;47:15;"And most of the people who are talking about it"
47:15;47:19;"and constantly tweeting about it and online all day, like, collecting them"
47:19;47:21;"are not really making money."
47:21;47:23;"And then there's, like, this handful of dudes at the top"
47:23;47:25;"who are making ridiculous amounts of money,"
47:25;47:29;"and I'm like, ""Okay, it looks like they're just screwing all of you guys."
47:29;47:33;"You're all getting ripped off, and you're going to their little raves and sh*t,"
47:33;47:34;"and you're paying."""
47:34;47:36;"There was the rave I went to, which I walked right into,"
47:36;47:38;"because I didn't even know it cost money."
47:38;47:43;"I later saw a tweet that someone paid $60,000 to get in."
47:43;47:44;"What the f*ck is that?"
47:44;47:45;"What?"
47:45;47:46;"God."
47:46;47:49;"It's because they have so much of these weird, you know,"
47:49;47:52;"internet things that are worth a lot of money,"
47:52;47:56;"and, like, the value of a dollar, like, whatever, they forget about it."
47:56;47:59;"And they're just like, ""Oh, $60,000, and I can skip the line"
47:59;48:02;"and get five of my friends in and free drinks?"
48:02;48:03;"Cool."""
48:03;48:05;"And it's like, ""No, what?"
48:05;48:08;"You just paid $60,000 to get into a party, you idiot."""
48:08;48:11;"And that's a new thing with these NFTs and these tokens."
48:11;48:15;"The token for the party I went to was Friends With Benefits,"
48:15;48:20;"and I think the idea behind that token is that it's like if you hold X amount,"
48:20;48:22;"you can get into all these events,"
48:22;48:26;"and you can get these perks at, like, parties you go to and sh*t."
48:26;48:29;"And it's f*cking insane, because I get the same perks."
48:29;48:31;"I don't have any tokens."
48:31;48:34;"Something very strange is happening in your timeline."
48:34;48:35;"That sounds wild, man."
48:35;48:38;"I also had a thought that maybe the reason you don't know any Phish songs"
48:38;48:41;"is because you crossed over into a timeline where NFT week"
48:41;48:45;"is something that happens in New York and the band Phish never existed."
48:45;48:47;"It's possible, although I've heard Phish."
48:47;48:53;"That's a weird memory you have from the old timeline."
48:53;48:58;"Man, I'm already picturing, like, when, like, Michael Lewis writes a book"
48:58;49:07;"about this time, it's going to, like, open at the Lil Baby Strokes party."
49:07;49:10;"I'm going to another one. I'm going to a crypto party tonight."
49:10;49:12;"Because it's still happening?"
49:12;49:14;"Why? I thought you hated it."
49:14;49:18;"I hated it, but that's the thing is that there's, like, this crossover,"
49:18;49:21;"because a lot of my friends are performing at these things,"
49:21;49:23;"and they're, like, in town, and I'm like,"
49:23;49:26;"""Wait, you guys all came here for f*cking crypto week?"""
49:26;49:30;"And it's like, yeah, we're getting paid way more than we get paid"
49:30;49:33;"for, like, a regular show because these guys don't care about money."
49:33;49:35;"They're not paid in cash, right?"
49:35;49:38;"Yeah, you're paid in, like, tokens or coins or whatever."
49:38;49:43;"But, I mean, you could sell that coin night of if you don't believe in this sh*t,"
49:43;49:45;"which is what I would probably do."
49:45;49:47;"Absolutely. Sell that now."
49:47;49:50;"Absolutely top of the market right now."
49:50;49:51;"Yeah."
49:51;49:56;"Chairlift was paid $80 million in Ether to reunite."
49:56;49:58;"No, no, this is a different show."
49:58;50:02;"Chairlift was paid $80 million."
50:02;50:06;"Original lineup of Chairlift, $80 million."
50:06;50:09;"They did a show, a party at Mercury Lounge."
50:09;50:13;"I can see it. That might happen tomorrow."
50:13;50:17;"Wow. We really crossed over into a new world."
50:17;50:19;"This is very vibing."
51:37;51:46;"So you don't hate crypto, but you hate NFTs. Is that correct?"
51:46;51:48;"I kind of hate all of it."
51:48;51:58;"I mean, I understand the importance of the decentralization of currency and the idea of like,"
51:58;52:13;"I mean, for me, it still seems like the overall idea of even introducing crypto into the world is to really stress that money is fake and stupid and bulls**t."
52:13;52:25;"And I can agree that money is fake, stupid bulls**t. But now you just have all these money hungry people who are trying to find ways to like scam more crypto and whatever
and scam money out of people."
52:25;52:28;"And now it's just like, now it's just hyper capitalism."
52:28;52:37;"And it's like, I thought the mission was to be like, you know, eat the rich and, you know, get all the poor people rich for pennies."
52:37;52:41;"Because like, we're smarter and like we could figure it out and whatever."
52:41;52:50;"But now it's like, let's all f**k each other over and get as rich as we can and like brag about being rich and throw parties about being rich."
52:50;52:51;"And that's right."
52:51;52:53;"Something got lost."
52:53;53:01;"And even beyond these like 20 year old billionaires who are forcing little baby to rap over strokes beats."
53:01;53:11;"There's probably also at this point, I mean, I think this is this is out there that at this point, the powers that be are definitely involved in the crypto market."
53:11;53:15;"Like the same old, same old, right? Like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, they have crypto, right?"
53:15;53:17;"They're involved in this."
53:17;53:21;"The first Bitcoin ETF launched like not long ago."
53:21;53:27;"Like that is happening. So you have like institutions getting in for sure."
53:27;53:28;"Because they have to."
53:28;53:29;"This is a wild time."
53:29;53:37;"You heard about the joke as coin where that guy made five point seven billion dollars on an eight thousand dollar investment."
53:37;53:38;"What was it called?"
53:38;53:40;"In a year, Shiba Inu."
53:40;53:44;"It was the it was like an offshoot of Dogecoin."
53:44;53:50;"The guy put eight thousand bucks in and his wallet is now worth five point seven billion."
53:50;53:51;"Did he cash out?"
53:51;53:55;"No, but that's the other thing is it feels like it's just some weird scam."
53:55;54:03;"Because how the f*** you gonna watch your eight thousand dollars turn into one hundred million, two hundred million, three hundred million and be like, nah, you know
what? I'm gonna wait."
54:03;54:05;"But also, how do you cash out?"
54:05;54:07;"This is like there is no that's not real."
54:07;54:08;"Can you cash out?"
54:08;54:09;"There's no bank that cashes out."
54:09;54:11;"That's what I don't know if it ever jumps."
54:11;54:12;"You could sell it."
54:12;54:15;"In theory, you sell it in the open market, right?"
54:15;54:17;"You sell it within the crypto space."
54:17;54:18;"Yes."
54:18;54:19;"Like it never turns into real cash."
54:19;54:24;"Right. But the market cap on Shiba Inu is forty nine billion or something."
54:24;54:27;"So technically, technically it could happen."
54:27;54:38;"But I think that person who is holding five point seven billion ends up with like two hundred million after they pay taxes and like all the fees and the whatever."
54:38;54:41;"But still, I mean, where are all the fees going to?"
54:41;54:43;"There's like gas fees."
54:43;54:45;"There's what I don't understand all that."
54:45;54:51;"But once obviously, once you're trading billions of dollars, everybody got off of that."
54:51;54:56;"A couple billion to the feds, one billion to little baby, one billion to the strokes."
54:56;54:57;"Yeah. Yeah."
54:57;55:02;"OK, by the way, I'm just getting word."
55:02;55:05;"I'm just getting word that Fugazi is reuniting."
55:05;55:13;"They're getting paid four hundred tokens of monkey and they're going to end world hunger with that."
55:13;55:14;"Absolutely."
55:14;55:22;"Yeah. They decided that the only way they could get around that five dollar frozen thing is to is to change the currency."
55:22;55:26;"So now it's actually five billion Shiba Inu coins."
55:26;55:29;"It's actually the richest band in the world now."
55:29;55:30;"Well, that makes sense."
55:30;55:32;"That sounds like a vice article."
55:32;55:36;"Did you know that Fugazi is the richest band in the world?"
55:36;55:41;"They own eight hundred billion dollars in monkey."
55:41;55:47;"The last Fugazi show, they took home three thousand dollars, invested it all in Bitcoin."
55:47;55:49;"And this was in 2002."
55:49;55:55;"So a little bit before people, very few people were in."
55:55;55:56;"They're all billionaires now."
55:57;56:07;"Somewhere in these private minds, the last will come just in time to clear out the chambers, show up the lips."
56:07;56:11;"That's the price to pay for hoping every slip's not a slide."
56:25;56:28;"In other words, not to get it wrong,"
56:28;56:32;"Pundits you up with as best as you run."
56:32;56:35;"Secured on the weight of one foot of ice."
56:35;56:40;"Love to sleep under clear, expansive skies."
56:40;56:43;"Have people been talking about the McRib NFT?"
56:43;56:47;"I haven't heard anyone mention that, but probably."
56:47;56:57;"I honestly also let me tell a little story that kind of really, I think, illustrates my disdain for this whole thing."
56:57;57:02;"And like, maybe this will give you some perspective, because I'm very mad about this."
57:02;57:06;"So I'm at that rave the other night."
57:06;57:07;"It's a block from my house."
57:07;57:10;"So I was like, this is pretty low stakes, whatever."
57:10;57:12;"I go walk home whenever I want."
57:12;57:14;"So I'm at the thing."
57:14;57:15;"I'm like drinking."
57:15;57:18;"What I keep getting like accosted by people."
57:18;57:20;"And I finally was like, I'm out."
57:20;57:22;"Like, I'm going to walk home."
57:22;57:24;"I'm not going to say bye to anybody, whatever."
57:24;57:26;"So I walk outside."
57:26;57:31;"I run into this guy who I actually did used to hang out with eight, nine years ago."
57:31;57:33;"So you actually have, you have memories of hanging out with this guy?"
57:33;57:34;"I know this guy."
57:34;57:35;"Yeah."
57:35;57:36;"Okay."
57:36;57:37;"So he's like, what's up?"
57:37;57:38;"I live in Detroit now."
57:38;57:39;"You know, whatever."
57:39;57:41;"I do an internet radio show."
57:41;57:43;"I have all this crypto stuff going on."
57:43;57:46;"I'm like, okay, wait, wait, wait, back up, back up."
57:46;57:48;"He does the internet radio show."
57:48;57:49;"Huh?"
57:49;57:51;"He does the internet radio show."
57:53;57:54;"Not a podcast."
57:54;57:56;"Look, man, I know."
57:56;57:58;"I know about the distinction."
57:58;58:00;"I like the cut of this guy's jib."
58:00;58:05;"You know, I think people who are on the cutting edge like this guy, they're not saying podcast, man."
58:05;58:06;"That's over."
58:06;58:07;"It's an internet radio show."
58:07;58:09;"They're not vlogging or whatever."
58:09;58:13;"And you're an internet radio OG."
58:13;58:14;"I'm a pioneer."
58:14;58:15;"Yeah."
58:15;58:16;"You're a pioneer."
58:16;58:17;"Okay."
58:17;58:19;"So he comes up to you, living in Detroit."
58:19;58:20;"I'm living in Detroit now."
58:20;58:25;"They're telling me, like, I don't really know what this rave I was just at is about."
58:25;58:26;"It kind of fills me in."
58:26;58:28;"He's like, yeah, I know the guys, whatever."
58:28;58:30;"Then here come the guys."
58:30;58:32;"It's like four or five guys walk out of the party."
58:32;58:35;"They're about to get in like a suburban."
58:35;58:36;"I guess they're leaving."
58:36;58:39;"And he's like, yo, yo, wait, come over here."
58:39;58:41;"Meet my friend."
58:41;58:46;"And it's like, okay, we're the four dorks or five dorks who, like, invented this thing."
58:46;58:48;"He's like, this is my friend, Def Spot."
58:48;58:50;"He's like the coolest guy who's here tonight."
58:50;58:52;"And I'm like, oh, cool."
58:52;58:59;"And then he's like, yo, can we send him 75 FWB real quick?"
58:59;59:03;"And I was like, I didn't, you know, like, I didn't ask for that."
59:03;59:08;"But then the guy, like one of these dorks is like, I don't know about that, man."
59:08;59:11;"You know, like, it's like he plays me kind of."
59:11;59:13;"And I'm like, yo, I'm not the guy."
59:13;59:14;"I didn't ask for that."
59:14;59:17;"But now I feel like I'm getting played by this nerd."
59:17;59:19;"And like, what am I supposed to do?"
59:19;59:20;"Beat you up?"
59:20;59:23;"Like, why did you just, like, turn your nose up at me, piece of shit?"
59:23;59:25;"I didn't ask you for anything."
59:25;59:30;"So then one of the other dorks kind of, like, hugs me from behind."
59:30;59:33;"And he goes like, good hanging, man."
59:33;59:37;"Kind of like some real patronizing, like, you'll get there one day, kid."
59:37;59:38;"Like, you know."
59:38;59:40;"And I was just like, what the fuck just happened?"
59:40;59:42;"And they all jump in a Suburban and leave."
59:42;59:47;"And I was like, I just got, like, fucked on by a group of nerds, kind of."
59:47;59:48;"They negged you."
59:48;59:50;"They negged me, but I never asked them for it."
59:50;59:53;"I didn't know I was asking for free money."
59:53;01:00:01;"And then, you know, I found out that's like $11,000 that this guy who is my friend was just being like,"
01:00:01;01:00:04;"yo, give my friend $11,000 real quick."
01:00:04;01:00:07;"But like, this is something that happens."
01:00:07;01:00:12;"Like, you know, had that played out differently, they would have been like, oh, yeah, you seem cool."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"Here's $11,000."
01:00:13;01:00:14;"Whatever."
01:00:14;01:00:15;"Anyway, I'm getting in my Uber."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"Like, that is the thing that happens."
01:00:17;01:00:23;"Right, because the fact that that guy even suggested it, you got the sense this is a somewhat normal thing."
01:00:23;01:00:31;"It was explained to me that you need, I think, that many of that coin to be allowed on their Discord server."
01:00:31;01:00:38;"So then if you have enough FWB, you can be on the Discord and, you know, be part of the whole thing."
01:00:38;01:00:43;"If you were like Timothee Chalamet and these guys are like, hey, hey, guys, you know Timothee Chalamet?"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"They'd be like, oh, yeah."
01:00:45;01:00:47;"We need to see the new Dune movie."
01:00:47;01:00:51;"All right, Tim, here's a 750 FWB."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"See on the Discord."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"And then Timothee could just be like, **** that."
01:00:55;01:01:02;"Like, I'm cashing out and, you know, get his whatever $100,000 and never join the Discord."
01:01:02;01:01:04;"But they're just really throwing money around."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"I mean, I'm so fascinated."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"I can't wait to see where it goes."
01:01:08;01:01:12;"I mean, of course, it sounds like such a big scam, but like clearly something's happening."
01:01:12;01:01:21;"Yeah, I mean, it's all part of, I guess, the, I don't know, decreasing the significance of money."
01:01:21;01:01:28;"When you say the decreasing significance of money, you mean that the whole concept is a scam and nobody cares about money anymore?"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"I think that's what's happening."
01:01:30;01:01:38;"But I also think if nobody cares about money anymore, why are you guys tripping over yourself to find ways to scam more money out of the system?"
01:01:38;01:01:46;"Like, well, I don't know that it seems like there could be a more constructive way to do whatever they're doing."
01:01:46;01:01:52;"When you say nobody cares about money anymore, because you also keep hearing these stories that nobody wants to work anymore,"
01:01:52;01:02:02;"maybe because people got their unemployment or their stimulus checks and people just don't really like care about."
01:02:02;01:02:10;"People who used to probably work certain jobs kind of like look at their options and say, ""Eh, I'd rather just like stay home."""
01:02:10;01:02:15;"But is that because people's values are changing or are there other reasons that people don't care about money?"
01:02:15;01:02:24;"I think large amounts of money feel more attainable to a lot of people who it never felt attainable to right now."
01:02:24;01:02:29;"If you're like a f***ing gamer and you spend all your time streaming games on it,"
01:02:29;01:02:36;"even those guys, they make tons of money with in-deals or whatever weird s*** they're doing."
01:02:36;01:02:43;"And then those people, of course, transition into the crypto NFT world because it's gamifying money, basically."
01:02:43;01:02:54;"And I think then on the macro level, you have old people like me and then even older people who are even older than me"
01:02:54;01:03:02;"who are like, ""What the f*** is this s***?"" And like, ""What the f*** is a $20 bill at this point?"""
01:03:02;01:03:09;"I don't even know. What's going on? This f***ing kid just gave another kid $100,000 for saying hello to him."
01:03:09;01:03:21;"What the hell is going on? And then I guess you can say that that contributes to this larger idea of just proving that money is fake or whatever."
01:03:21;01:03:23;"But then what do you do?"
01:03:23;01:03:28;"It's very confusing. I'm glad I don't live in that timeline."
01:03:28;01:03:37;"Maybe if I go to the NFT rave tonight, I can come back to the previous timeline."
01:03:37;01:03:43;"That actually could be kind of a tight movie. It opens on the last day of NFT week."
01:03:43;01:03:45;"Despot's really burned out."
01:03:45;01:03:46;"And rich."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"He's been disrespected by a bunch of nerds."
01:03:48;01:03:49;"Also not rich."
01:03:49;01:03:56;"Well, I'm not sure if you're rich or not rich in this premise, but basically you go to the crazy closing night rave."
01:03:56;01:04:00;"You got Yaysayer and Chairlift reunited, billion dollars a piece."
01:04:00;01:04:04;"Lil B and Animal Collective doing a set together."
01:04:04;01:04:08;"You have a great time, but you're kind of burned out on NFT week."
01:04:08;01:04:11;"Go home, go to sleep and say, ""I'm glad that's over."""
01:04:11;01:04:15;"Then you wake up the next morning, look at your phone."
01:04:15;01:04:18;"Wait a second. It's supposed to be Monday."
01:04:18;01:04:24;"You're forever trapped in NFT week and you have to crypto your way out."
01:04:24;01:04:28;"I don't know. That's the concept. That's the elevator pitch."
01:04:28;01:04:30;"All right. I like it."
01:04:30;01:04:35;"Actually, maybe it's the only way that you can get out of NFT week and get back onto the other timeline."
01:04:35;01:04:42;"Over the course of that one day, the last day of NFT week, you actually have to make a billion dollars in Ether yourself."
01:04:42;01:04:47;"It's like Groundhog's Day, but eventually you keep going back to that same interaction with the nerds."
01:04:47;01:04:50;"At first, you're all mad as they disrespect you."
01:04:50;01:04:55;"By the end, you're finally like, ""I'll [expletive] all your [expletive]."""
01:04:55;01:05:00;"It's part of the dialed in one in the movie that works out every time because I'm so used to it."
01:05:00;01:05:07;"I'm just like, ""Hey, man. What's up? 75FWB. That sounds sick. Here's my QR code. Anyway, see you later."""
01:05:07;01:05:11;"The other ones are the hard ones."
01:05:11;01:05:22;"Just little by little, you're rolling up to the little baby Strokes show. You're just begging Nick a lot for just a little bit of his Ether."
01:05:22;01:05:25;"Actually, I really like this. I think we should go pitch this."
01:05:25;01:05:28;"Nick, you work in TV. You like it?"
01:05:28;01:05:30;"Sold."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"Where is it going to air?"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"I think it's going to air on Coinbase."
01:05:34;01:05:37;"I think the loading is going to be that it's an NFT."
01:05:37;01:05:41;"We just sell it to one crypto billionaire?"
01:05:41;01:05:45;"It's a 90-minute NFT. I like that."
01:05:59;01:06:04;"But now the man is dead"
01:06:04;01:06:09;"He marched for the cause"
01:06:09;01:06:15;"In my heart"
01:06:15;01:06:18;"I will hear"
01:06:18;01:06:22;"That you can see"
01:06:22;01:06:28;"In my heart"
01:06:28;01:06:31;"In my heart"
01:06:31;01:06:34;"Has anybody done like a movie NFT yet?"
01:06:34;01:06:35;"They're working on it."
01:06:35;01:06:36;"Yeah, I feel like it's happening."
01:06:36;01:06:39;"I mean, there's a lot. I mean, there's so much going on with..."
01:06:39;01:06:42;"I mean, there's so... I can't really..."
01:06:42;01:06:45;"It would derail this whole episode."
01:06:45;01:06:53;"But it's so... I mean, the way people in TV and movies right now talk about NFTs is ridiculous."
01:06:53;01:06:56;"Very specifically, there is a NFT..."
01:06:56;01:07:00;"The first NFT show, like series."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"NFTV, if you will."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"That really is a low-hanging fruit."
01:07:06;01:07:11;"I've read hundreds of articles and no one has written that on this show called..."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"Cool, let's copyright NFTV."
01:07:13;01:07:15;"Matt, this is really when you need..."
01:07:15;01:07:16;"Matt, copyright that."
01:07:16;01:07:18;"Matt, copyright it."
01:07:18;01:07:26;"There's an NFT series called Stoner Cats that is about stoner cats."
01:07:26;01:07:35;"And it is created by Ashton Kutcher, sort of very known entrepreneurial tech crypto bro."
01:07:35;01:07:42;"Starring Mila Kunis, his wife, and Jane Fonda."
01:07:42;01:07:52;"And it's basically you buy these tokens for these drawings of these cats that are like stoned."
01:07:52;01:07:57;"And in theory, and they've made so much money, just millions of dollars off of this."
01:07:57;01:08:04;"With the promise that those who own these tokens, that own these pictures of these stoner cats,"
01:08:04;01:08:13;"will have access to a sort of anywhere between like a three to nine minute episodic TV show on stoner cats."
01:08:13;01:08:17;"But the show doesn't exist, and it may never exist."
01:08:17;01:08:23;"So the stoner cats would be voiced by Jane Fonda and Mila Kunis?"
01:08:23;01:08:24;"And Mila Kunis."
01:08:24;01:08:25;"Ashton Kutcher maybe."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"Yeah, I'm sure and Ashton Kutcher."
01:08:27;01:08:31;"Good at doing voices, it's one of his things that he does."
01:08:31;01:08:33;"Yeah, but one of the smartest..."
01:08:33;01:08:36;"So the thing is, it really blew up and you can read so much about it."
01:08:36;01:08:45;"And the whole thing is just totally seems like this insane, you know, grift house of cards or whatever."
01:08:45;01:08:51;"But one of the ways that they really pushed it and it blew up was they did do sort of cynically,"
01:08:51;01:08:54;"I think the smartest thing, just something I wish that I would have thought of,"
01:08:54;01:09:00;"which is they made one of the stars of the stoner cats, the guy that founded Ethereum."
01:09:00;01:09:04;"So the founder of the currency is one of the stoner cats."
01:09:04;01:09:09;"So like he pushed it out to all of, you know, his followers in the community."
01:09:09;01:09:10;"Wow."
01:09:10;01:09:16;"And they all bought these things because they're like, oh, this is essentially like this is like a cosine by Ethereum."
01:09:16;01:09:22;"And so, I mean, literally, if you look at it, I mean, it's just such an it's it's absolutely an absurd amount of money."
01:09:22;01:09:25;"I don't know if the thing will ever exist, but they've sold it as that."
01:09:25;01:09:34;"And now there are people doing the same thing with films, like trying to create companies around buying tokens that will help support films or get films made."
01:09:34;01:09:38;"Only the people with the tokens could watch the movie. Is that the idea?"
01:09:38;01:09:43;"Yeah, that it's certainly that it wouldn't be like a normal movie that gets released."
01:09:43;01:09:48;"It would be like 300 people have tokens and only those 300 people can watch the movie."
01:09:48;01:09:49;"Is that the idea?"
01:09:49;01:09:52;"I mean, you know, there's there's a lot of different models."
01:09:52;01:09:58;"And this is like it's going to turn like I don't know what I don't know what I'm feeling it out, but they're feeling it out."
01:09:58;01:10:03;"But there is a version where I think there are wide release movies that are supported by the people that own the tokens."
01:10:03;01:10:08;"And the success of the movie is you'd make money if you own those tokens."
01:10:08;01:10:09;"It's like investing in a movie."
01:10:09;01:10:10;"You're investing in the movie."
01:10:10;01:10:11;"OK."
01:10:11;01:10:18;"Although it does kind of sound like another way to to almost make people pretend they're investing in a movie, because there are things like that."
01:10:18;01:10:24;"I remember the first time I heard about it was there's a Japanese girl group that has like 30 members."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"This is way before the K-pop boom."
01:10:26;01:10:37;"But there is a J-pop group that has many members. And when you would buy a CD, you would get some sort of like legal documentation that you were buying like a share in the
organization."
01:10:37;01:10:44;"But as we all know, there's many ways to dilute shares or have kind of like almost like worthless shares."
01:10:44;01:10:50;"But people would like if you're a hardcore fan, you might go buy 10 CDs or more because you really wanted to be like supporting the organization."
01:10:50;01:10:58;"Feel like you own something. But it's like, you know, it's almost like if you're, you know, cutting something off the back of like a cereal box."
01:10:58;01:11:04;"You know, like sometimes when you there's like the tokens on some sort of game or something that would be like on the back of Captain Crunch."
01:11:04;01:11:10;"Then like you'd look down and be like, cash value of this is point zero zero zero zero zero one percent, like one cent."
01:11:10;01:11:13;"Because they're basically saying like, don't go crazy."
01:11:13;01:11:15;"This is actually not worth anything."
01:11:15;01:11:18;"And if we had to put a cash value on it, it would essentially be nothing."
01:11:18;01:11:23;"But it almost sounds a little bit like somebody's like, oh, yeah, yeah, I invested in this film."
01:11:23;01:11:31;"And they're like, well, yeah. So what you're like, you have like a share in the production company or you have like some you put in something with the creators."
01:11:31;01:11:36;"And it's like, well, no, I own a gif of a cat that I bought."
01:11:36;01:11:47;"You own a piece of the movie on the block chain, I guess, which is like and then if the movie is resold, you get your there's like a creator percentage or whatever."
01:11:47;01:11:48;"I don't know."
01:11:48;01:11:55;"It seems like a very easy way to scam people where they're kind of like, oh, no, no, you still own a percentage of the block chain version of the film."
01:11:55;01:12:01;"But, you know, the thing that we sold for one hundred million dollars to Netflix, that's something different."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"Well, that's off the chain."
01:12:03;01:12:06;"You know, people are making it's off."
01:12:06;01:12:10;"It's off the chain. Like, yeah, because Netflix doesn't show NFTs."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"You own some of the NFT."
01:12:12;01:12:17;"But yet Netflix, they don't actually you can't stream an NFT."
01:12:17;01:12:20;"So, yeah, we had to. Oh, we thought you knew that."
01:12:20;01:12:23;"Right. But that's what people are doing."
01:12:23;01:12:30;"You know, people are making like albums as NFTs and like selling songs as NFTs and selling publishing."
01:12:30;01:12:34;"Right. I mean, they're going to start selling up part of the publishing to people as NFTs."
01:12:34;01:12:44;"In some cases they're selling publishing, but in most cases what's actually happening is like like this kid who I know who performed at the rave I was at."
01:12:44;01:12:55;"His name is Halik Mall. I can't say he's ever had any success making music, but he just sold, I think, like one song or maybe an EP for like a quarter million."
01:12:55;01:13:04;"And like, you know, someone bought it, whatever, because he's part of this like NFT music community."
01:13:04;01:13:08;"And I was talking to him about it because I saw him at the thing and I was like, that's cool, man."
01:13:08;01:13:12;"Like, you know, whatever. But like, what does that mean?"
01:13:12;01:13:18;"You can set your creator percentage. So now, like whoever bought his he said at 15 percent."
01:13:18;01:13:25;"So whoever bought his whenever they sell it to someone else, he gets 15 percent of the sale forever."
01:13:25;01:13:31;"And beyond that, I was like, OK, but whoever bought it, they can exploit the music now. Right."
01:13:31;01:13:36;"Like you can they can release your album. They can license it in a movie. They could do whatever."
01:13:36;01:13:43;"And he was like, no, they just own it on the block chain. I can go sign a record deal for that album still."
01:13:43;01:13:48;"Like they don't actually write anything. They own the block chain version of it."
01:13:48;01:13:55;"Right. It kind of sounds like if you go to I was at Abbey Road Studios."
01:13:55;01:14:01;"They have like a store next to it. There's like, you know, because Beatle fanatics want to go and go to the crosswalk and take a picture."
01:14:01;01:14:06;"So then they have like a store next to the studio and you go in and there's all these like sweatshirts and stuff."
01:14:06;01:14:14;"There's also like they have stuff along the lines of like they were selling a piece of sheet music."
01:14:14;01:14:24;"And I guess maybe it was autographed by George Martin, but it was kind of made to look like his original score for like, I don't know, a day in the life or something."
01:14:24;01:14:29;"But then you look and you realize this is from like, you know, 2019."
01:14:29;01:14:38;"And it was a special run they did of collector's edition sheet music, basically just for, you know, Beatles obsessives to buy."
01:14:38;01:14:44;"And, you know, we were talking on the last episode about collectibles and what's going to hold value."
01:14:44;01:14:48;"And maybe with the Beatles, it's they're so popular that there'll always be something."
01:14:48;01:14:53;"But these similar to NFTs, these are not you're not buying like the thing."
01:14:53;01:15:03;"Like if you could buy George Martin's original score for a Beatles song, you know, in his handwriting from the 60s, that'll hold a special value historically forever."
01:15:03;01:15:12;"But then there are these things where, you know, somebody be like, this is the collectors only 1995 box set version of blah, blah, blah."
01:15:12;01:15:15;"You're buying something that has to do with the aura of the real thing."
01:15:15;01:15:23;"You're not buying anything even close to like the heart of like the valuable music collectible or the album itself."
01:15:23;01:15:28;"Just like you could go buy, yeah, like a special edition of Sergeant Pepper at an exorbitant price."
01:15:28;01:15:31;"It doesn't mean that you own like the masters."
01:15:31;01:15:38;"And I think there's like always been this kind of like funny thing where people try to squeeze as much money out of something as they can."
01:15:38;01:15:41;"Will this be different? I really wonder."
01:15:41;01:15:49;"It's really complicated if you wanted to like if you wanted to let a thousand people own a movie or a song, that would be extremely complicated."
01:15:49;01:15:51;"Like to police it, you mean?"
01:15:51;01:15:57;"Well, you just need every everybody would need a lawyer. You need to like, you know, sign documents and stuff."
01:15:57;01:16:01;"I don't know. Maybe an NFT heads listening is like, no, you guys don't understand."
01:16:01;01:16:03;"This is totally different."
01:16:03;01:16:10;"That's how every NFT conversation I've ever had with an NFT person goes. No, man, it's not that it's like this."
01:16:10;01:16:14;"And I'm just like, all right, I'm not falling for it, man."
01:16:14;01:16:19;"But granted, like I know I can sit down tonight and be like, all right, I'm going to do this."
01:16:19;01:16:26;"I'm going to make some type of I could do whatever I want and probably make like a million dollars this month."
01:16:26;01:16:29;"But I don't know. It feels gross."
01:16:29;01:16:35;"I was going to say, Despot, you have sort of famously never released a record."
01:16:35;01:16:39;"This is the conversation that I actually had with Haleak Mall."
01:16:39;01:16:47;"I was like, OK, so now is the time I have released these highly collectible songs and it's a lot of money."
01:16:47;01:16:55;"But then there's this other guy in the conversation who who founded like a crypto music platform."
01:16:55;01:17:02;"And I was like, I'm like sort of blowing up right now. And I asked him, I was like, all right, say you step to me and you're like,"
01:17:02;01:17:06;"give me an album's worth of songs to put on my platform."
01:17:06;01:17:16;"And, you know, the idea behind the platform is like, I don't know, like, like ownership of your through cryptocurrency."
01:17:16;01:17:23;"And I was like, that all sounds great. But like if a record label steps to me and says, I'm offering you five million dollars."
01:17:23;01:17:31;"What's the move here? Do I take the five million dollars? Like, or do I get on your platform and like own my ****?"
01:17:31;01:17:36;"He's like, oh, no, you take the five million dollars. I was like, all right, so what is this for?"
01:17:36;01:17:46;"And he was like, well, it's for like someone like Haleak Mall who like he can make a thousand dollars a month or, you know, whatever."
01:17:46;01:17:52;"Some rapper who's not on a label is not like well known. Make a thousand dollars a month."
01:17:52;01:17:56;"It sounds like that requires the NFT fervor to continue."
01:17:56;01:18:05;"Yeah. I really think that the Despot NFT Week, movie, NFT movie could really be good."
01:18:05;01:18:07;"And I also think. On NFTV, of course."
01:18:07;01:18:18;"On NFTV. It's going to be the first big hit on NFTV. And I think also because it's kind of cool and techie, it should be computer animation."
01:18:18;01:18:32;"So, Nick, I think you could really spearhead this. I think it should probably look like either like like Xavier Renegade Angel or like those Taiwanese computer
animated news clips that went viral like 10 years ago."
01:18:32;01:18:35;"Yeah. Or like look like Grand Theft Auto or something."
01:18:35;01:18:44;"You just kind of like watching Alec walk around NFT Week as he tries to get one billion ether so that he can get out of the time loop."
01:18:44;01:18:54;"It probably would be like much like Grand Theft Auto, because I think the way that movie resolves itself is I rob everybody, because that's the other thing."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"Yeah."
01:18:55;01:19:06;"Why aren't all these people getting robbed? They're like these dorks who probably who don't even care enough about money for like if you took their you blow off their
wrist, they probably like, oh, that sucks."
01:19:06;01:19:09;"But whatever. I'll get one tomorrow."
01:19:09;01:19:17;"But to rob somebody, though, you can't really you can't really do it through hacking. You'd have to go up to somebody and say, hey, brute force."
01:19:17;01:19:21;"Transfer this to my wallet or I'll use brute force against you."
01:19:21;01:19:29;"Well, that's how people get robbed for crypto. It's like the stick up has to be like you can't just take their phone because then you're not going to get it."
01:19:29;01:19:35;"You got to be like, yo, give me all your ****. Here's my **** address. And people do get robbed for crypto."
01:19:35;01:19:56;"You never give me your money. You only give me your funny paper. And in the middle of negotiations, you break down."
01:19:56;01:20:19;"I never give you my number. I only give you my situation. And in the middle of investigation, I break down."
01:20:19;01:20:34;"One thing I don't totally understand is with the block chain, because there's like a ledger for everything. People talk about that, giving people more anonymity and
freedom, but also theoretically, wouldn't that make it easier to track, say, somebody who kidnapped somebody for crypto?"
01:20:34;01:20:43;"Well, think about think about this 5.7 billionaire, which she knew nobody knows who it is. They just know that the wallet exists."
01:20:43;01:20:50;"Oh, interesting. I don't know. Why can't they find out? There must be that. I don't know."
01:20:50;01:21:00;"Well, I guess it depends what they do with it. If they want to buy traditional things like real estate, make rib NFTs, we'll say, wow, NFT week."
01:21:00;01:21:06;"That's a gross thing to talk about. Like, I feel like I feel disgusting talking about this stuff."
01:21:06;01:21:09;"All right, well, hold on. I got something else that's going to make you feel pretty good."
01:21:09;01:21:25;"OK, better bagel. Better Brand is a food tech startup company, and they just released the better bagel, which contains only five net carbohydrates, as opposed to a
regular bagel that features 50 to 60 net carbs, roughly as much as two slices of banana."
01:21:25;01:21:31;"It also contains the same amount of sugar content as one stalk of celery and the same protein content as four eggs."
01:21:31;01:21:37;"Amy Yang, founder and CEO of Better Brand, said, I started to look at all the innovation that was happening around us."
01:21:37;01:21:47;"If we can make beans into meat, then why can't we use food tech to enable a world where we can eat freely and to change the foods that we crave the most that are the worst for
us into foods that are actually good for us?"
01:21:47;01:21:57;"The main ingredient in the better bagels are refined wheat starch and not flour. You get a texture that where you feel like you're eating a food where you don't have to
compromise."
01:21:57;01:22:12;"They have a secret recipe. They have their own special dough. Kind of expensive right now. It doesn't cost 45 bucks, but this is kind of like the crypto bagels."
01:22:12;01:22:15;"Yeah, but it tastes like s***. You know it tastes like s***."
01:22:15;01:22:19;"Well, hold on. We're trying to track some down, maybe for the next episode."
01:22:19;01:22:21;"I want to see what it looks like."
01:22:21;01:22:27;"It's very Silicon Valley vibe. Oh, and by the way, even if you're not, you don't believe in it."
01:22:27;01:22:33;"Better Brand just closed a two point five million dollar fundraising round led by VC firm 776."
01:22:33;01:22:38;"So they're getting pretty much money for a bagel company. It's a lot of money for bagels."
01:22:38;01:22:46;"My favorite quote from that article is if you took our dough to any manufacturer, any bakery, they would have absolutely no idea what to do with it."
01:22:46;01:22:52;"Are these individually boxed bagels? They come in their own box for one bagel?"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"I think they might come in their own little wrapper."
01:22:54;01:23:02;"No, this is a cardboard box and it like a tray slides out and the bagel is in there. This is ridiculous."
01:23:02;01:23:12;"45 bucks for a dozen. I mean, I will say that I do love bagels and I don't eat them that much because there's too many net carbohydrates."
01:23:12;01:23:18;"And if they had less net carbohydrates, I might actually on the bus up to outside lands."
01:23:18;01:23:22;"I was starving and they're just like a full bagel spread."
01:23:22;01:23:26;"And I was like, all right, I don't care if this is up the show."
01:23:26;01:23:30;"I'm going to eat some bagels. And they're from Noah's Bagels, which is like a chain."
01:23:30;01:23:34;"It's kind of like an Einstein roast. But I'll tell you this. I don't know if I was just starving."
01:23:34;01:23:38;"It was excellent. It was really yourself."
01:23:38;01:23:42;"You see yourself about to be starving. You hit the road."
01:23:42;01:23:49;"Are you getting a better bagel or are you getting a Mickey D's Big Mac?"
01:23:49;01:23:54;"Oh, I'm getting a better bagel. Well, better brand, please."
01:23:54;01:24:01;"I'm Crisis. We're a very tech oriented show. If you check out the last episode, we actually had a death spot on."
01:24:01;01:24:07;"We did a whole thing about NFT week. We're always kind of informing our listeners about futuristic technology."
01:24:07;01:24:12;"We also cover food tech quite often. We're very interested in the food tech sector."
01:24:12;01:24:17;"So better bagel really sits at the intersection of a lot of our interests."
01:24:17;01:24:22;"We'd love to try it. We'll guarantee you minimum a B plus."
01:24:22;01:24:26;"You know, if the guys love it, we'll give it an A plus. But we're not going to on your product."
01:24:26;01:24:31;"So please, if you could send us some better bagels. Let's do business."
01:24:31;01:24:39;"OK, get in the top five. It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:24:39;01:24:46;"OK, so this week for the top five, we're comparing the top five hits of right now to the same week in 1981."
01:24:46;01:24:53;"Why 1981? Well, I already said it because that's when the Big Mac first hit the scene."
01:24:53;01:24:58;"The McRib. Oh, oops, the McRib. Got them all over the place."
01:24:58;01:25:09;"All right. The number five song on the Billboard Hot 100 this week in '81, Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, ""Trying to Live My Life Without You."""
01:25:09;01:25:11;"I don't know if I know this one."
01:25:22;01:25:34;"It is very similar to the Eagle song, ""The Long Run."" Oh, and this is a cover originally performed by Otis Clay in '73."
01:25:34;01:25:37;"Is this live? Yeah."
01:25:37;01:25:49;"I thought this was like a top five single. A live Bob Seger song?"
01:25:49;01:25:53;"I mean, he is great live. Jake and I saw him at the forum."
01:25:53;01:26:04;"You guys hear about that new McRib? New sandwich at McDonald's. Hear about that?"
01:26:04;01:26:06;"It is reconstituted rib meat."
01:26:06;01:26:11;"They shave it up real nice."
01:26:11;01:26:25;"This is so Bruce. And it's literally the same chord. The Eagles just took this chord progression."
01:26:25;01:26:34;"Oh, yeah. It's the same bass line and everything."
01:26:35;01:26:43;"I forgot the love we once shared. It's the hardest thing I'll ever find."
01:26:43;01:26:49;"I said."
01:26:49;01:26:53;"Introducing the McRib."
01:26:53;01:26:54;"The McRib."
01:26:54;01:27:10;"I'm excited that the McRib launched in the first year of Reagan's presidency."
01:27:10;01:27:15;"1981 truly was like, ""Welcome to the new America."""
01:27:15;01:27:16;"Yeah."
01:27:16;01:27:18;"Ronald Reagan, McRib."
01:27:18;01:27:21;"It's morning in America. Here's your McRib."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"Totally."
01:27:23;01:27:26;"Wow. I'm still shocked that that was a hit."
01:27:26;01:27:29;"A live Bob Seger cover."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Didn't feel like a hit."
01:27:31;01:27:35;"It felt like the deepest cut on his live record."
01:27:35;01:27:38;"I mean, it had good energy. Sure."
01:27:38;01:27:40;"He asked the crowd if they felt funky."
01:27:40;01:27:42;"I like that."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"Yeah, I'm feeling pretty funky."
01:27:44;01:27:46;"I mean, also like..."
01:27:46;01:27:48;"They all just ate McRib, so..."
01:27:48;01:27:51;"Now that you mention it."
01:27:51;01:27:57;"Maybe it's just an example of a white dude slightly misusing black slang."
01:27:57;01:28:01;"When I consider white people say feeling funky,"
01:28:01;01:28:05;"I generally would think that they were complaining about an upset stomach."
01:28:05;01:28:06;"Right."
01:28:06;01:28:10;"Feeling a little funky here after that McRib."
01:28:10;01:28:15;"It really depends, I think, on the context and the intonation."
01:28:15;01:28:18;"Because if you were like... Even if you were a white person,"
01:28:18;01:28:20;"you were like, ""I'm feeling funky."""
01:28:20;01:28:22;"That doesn't mean your stomach hurts."
01:28:22;01:28:25;"But if you were like, ""I'm feeling a little funky."""
01:28:25;01:28:27;"Right, especially a little funky."
01:28:27;01:28:28;"Yeah."
01:28:28;01:28:31;"Has James Brown ever said that he was feeling funky?"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"He definitely said, ""Make it funky."""
01:28:33;01:28:36;"He must have said he was feeling funky at some point."
01:28:36;01:28:39;"Bob Seger, though."
01:28:39;01:28:42;"""Oh, man, I'm feeling a little funky."""
01:28:42;01:28:44;"""What's the matter, Bob?"""
01:28:44;01:28:48;"""Oh, you know, man, I couldn't resist that second McRib."""
01:28:48;01:28:54;"""I know it wasn't a good-- Oh, man, my wife is always telling me to eat healthier."""
01:28:54;01:28:58;"""Oh, man, I think we're going to have to push the show."""
01:28:58;01:28:59;"""All right, Bob."""
01:28:59;01:29:01;"Right, so he got on stage and he's like,"
01:29:01;01:29:06;"""Is anyone else feeling, like, funky?"""
01:29:06;01:29:08;"Because I might have to go."
01:29:08;01:29:11;"Yeah, people say feeling funky all the time."
01:29:11;01:29:14;"Oh, Corey Feldman had a song called ""Feeling Funky."""
01:29:14;01:29:20;"I can't say I would ever say feeling funky to mean that my stomach hurts."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"It doesn't seem like your style."
01:29:22;01:29:24;"I'm picturing the next night, Bob's like,"
01:29:24;01:29:27;"""You know what? I'm just going to have a salad before the show."""
01:29:27;01:29:32;"And the salad in 1981 is just iceberg lettuce with, like, a half a gallon of ranch."
01:29:32;01:29:34;"Tucked on there."
01:29:34;01:29:39;"""I got to eat healthy tonight, folks."""
01:29:39;01:29:47;"In '81, Bob Seger was doing two to four McRibs on stage"
01:29:47;01:29:50;"during his tour with the Silver Bullet Band."
01:29:50;01:29:52;"The night that ""Try to Live My Life Without You"" was recorded,"
01:29:52;01:29:57;"he was definitely feeling funky, and pretty soon he kind of ended the tradition."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"Yeah, that was a crazy time."
01:29:58;01:30:01;"The McRib had just come out. I was loving them."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"I would eat one on stage."
01:30:03;01:30:09;"All right, the number five song this week in 2021,"
01:30:09;01:30:13;"I have a feeling it's not going to be a live Bob Seger track,"
01:30:13;01:30:14;"but let's check it out."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"Oh, no, it's Drake featuring Future and Young Thug."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"It's another cover."
01:30:21;01:30:23;"It's kind of another cover."
01:30:31;01:30:36;"This is the ""I'm Too Sexy"" cassette single."
01:30:36;01:30:38;"Of the original ""Right Side Fred""?"
01:30:38;01:30:39;"Yes."
01:30:39;01:30:41;"I mean, it's a classic."
01:30:50;01:30:52;"I feel like we did an ""I'm Too Sexy"" breakdown on the show,"
01:30:52;01:30:55;"like, three or four years ago."
01:30:55;01:30:56;"You have the actual song?"
01:30:56;01:31:00;"Yeah, that's probably where they got the idea to do this song from."
01:31:00;01:31:03;"I mean, this is no value judgment,"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"because this song has some appeal,"
01:31:05;01:31:10;"but I could totally picture, like, on some TV show or movie,"
01:31:10;01:31:14;"like, when trap first became, like, the dominant form of music,"
01:31:14;01:31:19;"if somebody was making, like, a trap CB4 kind of parody"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"six or seven years ago,"
01:31:21;01:31:25;"I really could imagine them doing a song that sampled"
01:31:25;01:31:29;"""I'm Too Sexy"" with a trap beat"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"and made, like, a fake song."
01:31:31;01:31:32;"Mm-hmm."
01:31:32;01:31:34;"""I'm Too Sexy"" from..."
01:31:34;01:31:37;"The song sounds like a joke, is what you're saying."
01:31:37;01:31:38;"[laughs]"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"I would never say that, but..."
01:31:40;01:31:42;"You're saying it kind of sucks."
01:31:42;01:31:45;"No, but I'm saying also what maybe would have seemed like a joke"
01:31:45;01:31:48;"six or seven years ago, maybe in this era,"
01:31:48;01:31:50;"and during NFT week, you know,"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"because that does happen."
01:31:52;01:31:54;"No, truly, I don't mean a value judgment."
01:31:54;01:31:57;"Things that would have seemed, like, absurd back in the day,"
01:31:57;01:32:01;"you know, taste change, and there's something kind of bold about it."
01:32:01;01:32:04;"Bold like the taste of the McRib."
01:32:04;01:32:05;"I know."
01:32:05;01:32:07;"I know, and I'm pretty forgiving."
01:32:07;01:32:09;"That was rough stuff. Let's move on."
01:32:09;01:32:10;"I like it."
01:32:10;01:32:12;"[laughs]"
01:32:12;01:32:13;"Well..."
01:32:13;01:32:15;"Me and Despa like it. What the [bleep] is wrong with you guys?"
01:32:15;01:32:16;"Takes all kinds, huh?"
01:32:16;01:32:19;"I will say that the two number fives that we've heard,"
01:32:19;01:32:22;"the live Bob Seger and the new Drake,"
01:32:22;01:32:25;"they do both kind of have McRib flavor."
01:32:25;01:32:27;"1981 and 2021."
01:32:27;01:32:28;"You know what I mean?"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"Real dregs."
01:32:30;01:32:31;"That's not what I mean."
01:32:31;01:32:33;"We're scraping the bottom here."
01:32:33;01:32:35;"Reconstituted."
01:32:35;01:32:36;"Right, there you go."
01:32:36;01:32:37;"[laughs]"
01:32:37;01:32:38;"That's true."
01:32:38;01:32:45;"The number four song this week in the year zero for the McRib, 1981,"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"is Sheena Easton, ""For Your Eyes Only."""
01:32:47;01:32:50;"Oh, and this was the theme to a James Bond movie."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"There's a new James Bond movie out now."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"Haven't seen it yet. Have you seen it?"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"I haven't seen it."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"Someone just asked me to go see it."
01:32:58;01:33:00;"And then they were--"
01:33:00;01:33:01;"During an FT week?"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"Yeah, exactly."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"I was like, ""Are you [bleep] crazy?"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"I'm going to go see a movie?"""
01:33:07;01:33:09;"I'm going to go make $300 million this week."
01:33:09;01:33:12;"I don't have time to see James Bond."
01:33:12;01:33:16;"Would you ask Karl Lagerfeld during Paris Fashion Week"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"if he wants to go see the new Star Wars?"
01:33:18;01:33:20;"[bleep] moron."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"Right."
01:33:37;01:33:38;"Do I know this song?"
01:33:38;01:33:41;"Yeah, this is weird."
01:33:41;01:33:44;"Introducing the McRib."
01:33:44;01:33:47;"Reconstituted rib meat."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"This is a James Bond movie?"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"New."
01:33:51;01:33:53;"This was in the James Bond movie."
01:33:53;01:33:54;"This was the opening credits,"
01:33:54;01:33:59;"very low energy opening credits of an early '80s Bond film."
01:33:59;01:34:03;"Probably late period Roger Moore, I'm guessing."
01:34:03;01:34:05;"Sounds like--"
01:34:05;01:34:09;"Could definitely be a sitcom theme from that era."
01:34:09;01:34:10;"Yeah."
01:34:10;01:34:13;"It's hard to picture going from this to Mr. Bond."
01:34:13;01:34:15;"[laughs]"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"I mean, James Bond movies,"
01:34:17;01:34:19;"I'm sure somebody's charted it."
01:34:19;01:34:24;"Now a James Bond movie is 87% action."
01:34:24;01:34:28;"It's just crazy scenes and the camera's shaking"
01:34:28;01:34:31;"and he's busting through windows and stuff."
01:34:31;01:34:32;"Back then, James Bond movies,"
01:34:32;01:34:35;"there were a lot of just talk."
01:34:35;01:34:38;"Yeah, it's like he's checking into a hotel."
01:34:38;01:34:40;"Way more sex."
01:34:40;01:34:43;"He looks at the woman at the bar."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"He plays roulette for 20 minutes."
01:34:45;01:34:47;"Yeah, goes for a swim."
01:34:47;01:34:48;"This is crazy."
01:34:48;01:34:50;"I definitely would have thought"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"this is just somewhere in the movie,"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"but it really is the theme song."
01:34:54;01:34:56;"This is insane."
01:34:56;01:35:00;"This, you picture Mr. Belvedere petting a dog or whatever"
01:35:00;01:35:03;"and he throws a Frisbee or whatever."
01:35:03;01:35:04;"Like in slow-mo."
01:35:04;01:35:06;"Yeah, exactly."
01:35:06;01:35:12;"It'd be funny if the villain in this movie was Mr. Belvedere."
01:35:12;01:35:15;"But what's happening during the opening"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"to the James Bond movie with that song?"
01:35:17;01:35:19;"Is he just putting his socks on?"
01:35:19;01:35:20;"What is it?"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"As a point of comparison,"
01:35:22;01:35:24;"play the one from the new movie."
01:35:24;01:35:26;"I think it's Billie Eilish."
01:35:26;01:35:27;"It's dubstep."
01:35:27;01:35:30;"Eason can be seen performing, for your eyes only,"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"at the beginning of the movie,"
01:35:32;01:35:34;"making it the only Bond theme"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"where the artist can actually be seen on screen"
01:35:36;01:35:38;"seeing the song."
01:35:38;01:35:41;"Usually the themes are highly choreographed"
01:35:41;01:35:44;"scenes of someone dancing"
01:35:44;01:35:47;"or silhouetted with crazy colors."
01:35:47;01:35:49;"Goat finger!"
01:35:49;01:35:51;"[imitates music]"
01:35:51;01:35:53;"So this is just James Bond in a jazz club"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"and Sheena Easton singing."
01:35:55;01:35:56;"She's just singing it."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"He's in a soft rock club."
01:35:58;01:35:59;"[laughs]"
01:35:59;01:36:00;"Right."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"Is this the new Bond?"
01:36:06;01:36:07;"Yeah."
01:36:07;01:36:10;"It's already a million times spookier."
01:36:10;01:36:12;"But similarly..."
01:36:12;01:36:13;"Low energy."
01:36:13;01:36:14;"Yeah."
01:36:14;01:36:15;"[laughs]"
01:36:15;01:36:17;"They're allowed to be low energy."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"They can just be really spooky."
01:36:19;01:36:22;"[imitates music]"
01:36:22;01:36:24;"That's just the theme song."
01:36:24;01:36:27;"But Goat Finger is pretty banging."
01:36:27;01:36:29;"Living Let Die is kind of banging too."
01:36:29;01:36:30;"Yeah."
01:36:34;01:36:41;"I'd leave alone"
01:36:41;01:36:46;"Just goes to show"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"That the blood you bleed"
01:36:48;01:36:54;"Is just the blood you own"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"We were living"
01:36:56;01:37:01;"Does Billie Eilish always sing like a witch?"
01:37:01;01:37:02;"Is that her thing?"
01:37:02;01:37:03;"I don't really know her music."
01:37:03;01:37:05;"She's doing something kind of different here."
01:37:05;01:37:08;"I usually think of her as more of a kind of breathy,"
01:37:08;01:37:10;"kind of whispering vibes."
01:37:10;01:37:12;"Yeah."
01:37:12;01:37:14;"You were my life"
01:37:14;01:37:19;"But life is far away from fair"
01:37:19;01:37:23;"Was I stupid to love you?"
01:37:23;01:37:26;"Was I reckless to help?"
01:37:26;01:37:33;"Was it obvious to everybody else"
01:37:33;01:37:36;"That I'd fall in love with you?"
01:37:36;01:37:37;"I'm not mad at this."
01:37:37;01:37:40;"And they're actually using James Bond intervals."
01:37:40;01:37:42;"[imitates music]"
01:37:42;01:37:46;"I'd rather run in my side"
01:37:46;01:37:50;"Fool me once, fool me twice"
01:37:50;01:37:52;"Does the James Bond theme song"
01:37:52;01:37:54;"always have to be the name of the movie?"
01:37:54;01:37:57;"I think that's how it is, yeah."
01:37:57;01:37:58;"What's the new one called, Time to Die?"
01:37:58;01:37:59;"No Time to Die?"
01:37:59;01:38:00;"Yeah."
01:38:00;01:38:01;"No Time to Die?"
01:38:01;01:38:02;"No Time to Die."
01:38:02;01:38:05;"All right, well this sounds James Bond-y."
01:38:05;01:38:07;"I kind of want to see that movie."
01:38:15;01:38:19;"I'd let it burn"
01:38:19;01:38:23;"All right, so a lot's changed on the James Bond front in 40 years."
01:38:23;01:38:28;"The number four song in 2021,"
01:38:28;01:38:29;"we've heard this one a lot,"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"Ed Sheeran, Bad Habits."
01:38:31;01:38:32;"His album just came out."
01:38:32;01:38:34;"You listen, Jake?"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"I have not had a chance yet."
01:38:36;01:38:37;"Do you know this one?"
01:38:37;01:38:38;"I haven't heard this."
01:38:38;01:38:40;"Oh yeah, we've heard this many times."
01:38:40;01:38:43;"This is the song of the summer."
01:38:43;01:38:45;"You never heard this?"
01:38:45;01:38:49;"Maybe, let's see when it gets into the thick of it."
01:38:49;01:38:52;"Does he talk about Chinese food in it?"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"[laughter]"
01:38:54;01:38:59;"No, he kind of got away from that hyper-specific storytelling vibe on this one."
01:38:59;01:39:01;"That's too bad."
01:39:13;01:39:15;"Oh yeah, I do know that song."
01:39:15;01:39:18;"I like this song more and more every time I hear it."
01:39:18;01:39:23;"This song is kind of about me at the NFT rave."
01:39:23;01:39:26;"Conversations with a stranger I barely know."
01:39:26;01:39:28;"This is your NFT week anthem."
01:39:28;01:39:29;"Yeah."
01:39:43;01:39:46;"All right, solid song."
01:39:46;01:39:52;"One thing that's so crazy is that the Chinese food song, what's it called again?"
01:39:52;01:39:53;"Shape of You."
01:39:53;01:39:55;"That song is just so big."
01:39:55;01:39:59;"I think that's one of the biggest songs of all time."
01:39:59;01:40:00;"That's so depressing."
01:40:00;01:40:04;"Even Bad Habits is going to have a hard time catching up to Shape of You."
01:40:04;01:40:07;"Reconstituted rib meat."
01:40:07;01:40:08;"[laughter]"
01:40:08;01:40:11;"Reconstituted rib meat."
01:40:11;01:40:18;"All right, the number three song back in '81, Christopher Cross, Arthur's Theme."
01:40:18;01:40:20;"Wow, we're deep into the soft rock era."
01:40:20;01:40:22;"This is peak."
01:40:22;01:40:26;"This is that depressing early '80s stuff."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"I like Christopher Cross, but he's--"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"I like Sailing, I guess."
01:40:30;01:40:32;"I wouldn't say I'm a Christopher Cross fan."
01:40:32;01:40:34;"Sailing's vibey."
01:40:34;01:40:41;"This is like if you're in a Russian barbershop, you might hear this song."
01:40:41;01:40:45;"Christopher Cross is really beloved across cultures."
01:40:45;01:40:46;"It's true."
01:40:46;01:40:52;"You know something Christopher Cross has in common with Billie Eilish?"
01:40:52;01:40:53;"What's that?"
01:40:53;01:40:56;"They both swept the Grammys."
01:40:56;01:41:02;"People talk about the big four, which are Best New Artist, Song of the Year,"
01:41:02;01:41:04;"Record of the Year, Album of the Year."
01:41:04;01:41:08;"It's very, very rare that anybody wins all four of those categories."
01:41:08;01:41:11;"I'm sure there's others, but off the top of my head, I know Billie Eilish"
01:41:11;01:41:14;"and Christopher Cross were two of the only ones who ever did."
01:41:14;01:41:20;"In Christopher Cross' case, it was kind of a curse."
01:41:20;01:41:21;"I mean, just in the sense that he--"
01:41:21;01:41:22;"Too much too soon."
01:41:22;01:41:23;"Yeah."
01:41:29;01:41:33;"The B-side of this is a song called ""Minstrel Gigolo."""
01:41:33;01:41:35;"[laughter]"
01:41:35;01:41:36;"That's a title."
01:41:55;01:42:00;"I just love the bit of introducing the McRib."
01:42:00;01:42:02;"It works on all those songs."
01:42:06;01:42:10;"The number--"
01:42:10;01:42:11;"Here we go."
01:42:11;01:42:15;"The number three song back in 2021,"
01:42:15;01:42:18;"you got to give it up, Biggest Artist in the World,"
01:42:18;01:42:21;"another one, Ed Sheeran with ""Shivers."""
01:42:30;01:42:31;"Do I know this one?"
01:42:31;01:42:35;"This is newer, so it hasn't been out quite as long."
01:42:35;01:42:37;"Shiver me timbers."
01:42:37;01:42:41;"[laughter]"
01:42:41;01:42:42;"Shiver me timbers."
01:42:42;01:42:46;"I haven't really been taking Ubers much lately,"
01:42:46;01:42:48;"and so I'm missing a lot of this stuff."
01:43:01;01:43:03;"I mean, I like this slightly better than ""Bad Habits."""
01:43:16;01:43:18;"""I want to stay up all day"" is kind of weird to say."
01:43:18;01:43:22;"[laughter]"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"Everybody wants to stay up all day."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"[laughter]"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"Maybe it works with night shifts."
01:43:28;01:43:31;"I mean, he said, ""I want to stay up all day and all night."""
01:43:31;01:43:32;"And all night."
01:43:32;01:43:36;"But to say, ""I want to stay up all day"" is kind of weird."
01:43:36;01:43:39;"[laughter]"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"Too bad you weren't in the room with him, man."
01:43:41;01:43:42;"That's true."
01:43:42;01:43:43;"You could have helped him out."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"Ed, I don't know, Ed."
01:43:45;01:43:47;"Are you narcoleptic or something?"
01:43:47;01:43:48;"Are you good?"
01:43:48;01:43:49;"[laughter]"
01:44:14;01:44:18;"Honestly, ""I want to be that guy"" is a weird thing to say, too."
01:44:18;01:44:19;"You know?"
01:44:19;01:44:21;"You don't want to be that guy."
01:44:21;01:44:24;"Yeah, generally people say, ""Not to be that guy."""
01:44:24;01:44:25;"Right."
01:44:25;01:44:26;"[laughter]"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"He's like, ""I want to be that guy."""
01:44:28;01:44:30;"Unless he's talking about a very specific guy."
01:44:30;01:44:32;"""I want to stay up all day."""
01:44:32;01:44:34;"He's just watching this girl dance with some guy,"
01:44:34;01:44:36;"and he says, ""I want to be that guy."""
01:44:36;01:44:38;"Right, I get that."
01:44:38;01:44:42;"But then he should have said it, like, ""I want to be that guy."""
01:44:42;01:44:43;"Hmm."
01:44:43;01:44:45;"We should check out--"
01:44:45;01:44:48;"Jake, when you're painting later today,"
01:44:48;01:44:50;"throw on the new album, ""Equal."""
01:44:50;01:44:52;"Is that the name of the record?"
01:44:52;01:44:53;"Equals."
01:44:53;01:44:57;"Equals, because all his albums are math stuff."
01:44:57;01:44:58;"Really?"
01:44:58;01:45:02;"His first album was called ""Plus,"" with a plus sign."
01:45:02;01:45:06;"And then he came back with ""X,"" also known as ""Multiply."""
01:45:06;01:45:08;"And then he came back with ""Divide,"""
01:45:08;01:45:10;"and it's just the divide sign."
01:45:10;01:45:12;"So he's got all these ones, equals."
01:45:12;01:45:16;"So the only thing he hasn't done yet is minus."
01:45:16;01:45:18;"Maybe he feels like that's too negative."
01:45:18;01:45:21;"Quite literally negative."
01:45:21;01:45:22;"Yeah."
01:45:22;01:45:24;"Or maybe that's next, minus."
01:45:24;01:45:28;"It's going to be his, like, ""Roll a [bleep] You"" album."
01:45:28;01:45:33;"The number two song this week in '81,"
01:45:33;01:45:37;"after a bunch of soft rock, here's some rock rock."
01:45:37;01:45:40;"This is the one, ""Start Me Up."""
01:45:40;01:45:42;"Hell yeah."
01:45:42;01:45:45;"Yeah, this song is not older than that."
01:45:45;01:45:48;"This was like their last hit, early '80s,"
01:45:48;01:45:50;"although they recorded it in the '70s."
01:45:50;01:45:54;"[music - ""start me up""]"
01:45:54;01:45:57;"(SINGING) You can start me up."

01:46:02;01:46:05;"You can start me up."
01:46:05;01:46:10;"You can start me up, I'll never stop."
01:46:10;01:46:13;"I've been running hot."
01:46:13;01:46:18;"You got me rickin', I don't know my top."
01:46:18;01:46:21;"You can start me up."
01:46:21;01:46:24;"Well, as discussed, the ""Tattoo You"" album,"
01:46:24;01:46:27;"Side B, a true classic."
01:46:27;01:46:28;"Oh, you know what?"
01:46:28;01:46:31;"It was just the 40th anniversary of ""Tattoo You,"""
01:46:31;01:46:33;"because I was walking down the street,"
01:46:33;01:46:36;"and I saw this big poster,"
01:46:36;01:46:39;"it was like, ""Rolling Stones, 'Tattoo You.'"""
01:46:39;01:46:41;"And I had a slight moment,"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"I fell into an alternative timeline,"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"then I looked a little closer,"
01:46:45;01:46:47;"and it was 40th anniversary edition."
01:46:47;01:46:49;"I think they got it back on the charts."
01:46:49;01:46:50;"Really?"
01:46:50;01:46:54;"Yeah, it came in at number 25 on the album charts this week."
01:46:54;01:46:56;"That's insane."
01:46:56;01:47:01;"People are buying a digital copy of ""Tattoo You"" on their--"
01:47:01;01:47:03;"Maybe they did a special--"
01:47:03;01:47:06;"Maybe they did a new vinyl with extra stuff."
01:47:06;01:47:11;"Well, this whole record is a bunch of basically unfinished B-sides"
01:47:11;01:47:15;"from earlier records throughout the '70s."
01:47:15;01:47:17;"I need a fire."
01:47:17;01:47:21;"Don't make a grown man cry."
01:47:25;01:47:28;"Don't make a grown man cry."
01:47:28;01:47:31;"I mean, the best line in the song is at the end,"
01:47:31;01:47:34;"because this whole time he's been talking about,"
01:47:34;01:47:38;"it's all pretty general, just like rock, sexy rock lyrics,"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"""You make a grown man cry,"""
01:47:40;01:47:43;"and then just at the end, he just changes it up and starts going,"
01:47:43;01:47:45;"""You make a dead man [bleep]."""
01:47:45;01:47:47;"Classic."
01:47:47;01:47:49;"That's wild."
01:47:49;01:47:52;"I just love that he saves it for the end."
01:47:52;01:47:53;"Yeah."
01:47:53;01:47:56;"He's talking about that he rides in a mean machine,"
01:47:56;01:47:59;"""You got me running hot,"" all this stuff,"
01:47:59;01:48:03;"and then by the end, he's like, ""You make a dead man cry."""

01:48:11;01:48:15;"Ride like the wind at double speed."

01:48:21;01:48:25;"[vocalizing]"
01:48:25;01:48:28;"So ""Start Me Up"" was recorded during the Some Girls sessions,"
01:48:28;01:48:31;"which was, what, like in '78 or something?"
01:48:31;01:48:32;"That came out in '78."
01:48:32;01:48:33;"'77."
01:48:33;01:48:37;"It began as a reggae rock song named ""Never Stop."""
01:48:37;01:48:39;"I kind of want to hear the reggae version."
01:48:39;01:48:42;"After dozens of takes, it was abandoned,"
01:48:42;01:48:46;"and then in '81, engineer Chris Kimsey found two takes of ""Start Me Up"""
01:48:46;01:48:49;"with a more rock vibe, including run throughs--"
01:48:49;01:48:50;"All right, wait."
01:48:50;01:48:51;"--""Start Me Up"" took about six hours to record."

01:48:58;01:49:01;"You make a dead man cry."
01:49:01;01:49:06;"The lyrics-- the lyrics of Sir Mick Jagger."
01:49:06;01:49:10;"Although it seems like they're referencing a song from 1935"
01:49:10;01:49:14;"called ""Shave 'Em Dry"" by Lucille Bogan."
01:49:14;01:49:17;"Matt, can we listen to Lucille Bogan ""Shave 'Em Dry""?"
01:49:17;01:49:21;"Oh, this is like a real-- this is a real dirty old song."
01:49:21;01:49:23;"Wait, what does that mean, ""Shave 'Em Dry""?"
01:49:23;01:49:25;"I don't know. We got to listen to it."
01:49:25;01:49:27;"I feel like they'll have to bleep out this whole song,"
01:49:27;01:49:31;"but, you know, a lot of people-- this song is actually from the '20s."
01:49:31;01:49:36;"Sometimes people forget that everybody thinks their generation invented sex."
01:49:36;01:49:38;"Guess what, folks?"
01:49:38;01:49:41;"There have been horny, dirty songs as long as there have been songs."
01:49:41;01:49:44;"Oh, wow. I'm looking at the lyrics right now."

01:54:11;01:54:13;"Oh, right, so he's a mixture of both."
01:54:13;01:54:14;"Yeah."
01:54:14;01:54:18;"Danny Brown, Adele, Ed Sheeran start a super group."
01:54:18;01:54:21;"It's called Equation."
01:54:21;01:54:26;"They use numbers, symbols, teach kids about math."
01:54:26;01:54:28;"Anyway, the song is called Easy on Me."
01:54:28;01:54:31;"I've already watched the video, I've heard it."
01:54:31;01:54:35;"But I'm curious to see people who haven't heard it to get their gut reaction."
01:54:35;01:54:38;"I've already spent some time with this."
01:54:38;01:54:45;"I saw a bunch of Adele at Carnival Halloween party."
01:54:45;01:54:48;"Oh, right, from that picture from last year?"
01:54:48;01:54:49;"Yeah."
01:54:49;01:54:53;"She's also in the Bond single club."
01:54:53;01:54:56;"She did a Bond song? Skyfall."
01:54:56;01:55:03;"That I've been washing my hands in forever"
01:55:03;01:55:10;"I know there is hope in these waters"
01:55:10;01:55:17;"But I can't bring myself to swim when I am drowning"
01:55:17;01:55:24;"In this silence baby let me in"
01:55:24;01:55:30;"Go easy on me baby"
01:55:30;01:55:34;"I was still a child"
01:55:34;01:55:39;"Didn't get the chance to feel"
01:55:39;01:55:41;"I mean, this sounds like an Adele song."
01:55:41;01:55:42;"Yeah, it does."
01:55:42;01:55:44;"The world around me"
01:55:44;01:55:47;"It's definitely on some classic Adele sh*t."
01:55:47;01:55:50;"What I chose to do"
01:55:50;01:55:55;"So go easy on me"
01:55:55;01:56:10;"There ain't no room for things to change"
01:56:10;01:56:17;"When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways"
01:56:17;01:56:24;"You can't deny how hard I've tried"
01:56:24;01:56:30;"I changed who I was to put you both first"
01:56:30;01:56:34;"But now I give up"
01:56:34;01:56:41;"Go easy on me baby"
01:56:41;01:56:44;"I was still a child"
01:56:44;01:56:52;"Didn't get the chance to feel"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"The world around me"
01:56:54;01:56:58;"Had no time to choose"
01:56:58;01:57:01;"What I chose to do"
01:57:01;01:57:06;"So go easy on me"
01:57:06;01:57:08;"I mean, nothing not to like."
01:57:08;01:57:11;"Yeah, pretty classic Adele piano ballad."
01:57:11;01:57:14;"Yeah, very just heavy emotion."
01:57:14;01:57:17;"She's definitely like doing some excellent vocal performance."
01:57:17;01:57:21;"That ""eeh"""
01:57:21;01:57:23;"Pretty special."
01:57:23;01:57:25;"It's not fun. That's my only issue with it."
01:57:25;01:57:31;"That probably doesn't even show"
01:57:31;01:57:34;"Go easy on me baby"
01:57:34;01:57:39;"Do you think there's any impulse after five years to just do something different?"
01:57:39;01:57:40;"Have some fun, man."
01:57:40;01:57:43;"This is just like, what kind of..."
01:57:43;01:57:46;"This just bums me out."
01:57:46;01:57:51;"Maybe there'll be like an Ed Sheeran dance hall remix."
01:57:51;01:57:54;"Ed's having too much fun. You gotta split the difference."
01:57:54;01:57:56;"Between Adele and Ed."
01:57:56;01:57:58;"That's the equation. You got it."
01:57:58;01:58:00;"The equation is"
01:58:00;01:58:03;"Ed minus fun"
01:58:03;01:58:05;"Adele plus fun"
01:58:05;01:58:07;"And then they meet in the middle."
01:58:07;01:58:10;"That'll be on their collab album."
01:58:10;01:58:12;"We need to write it out."
01:58:12;01:58:17;"Ed divided by two plus Adele divided by two."
01:58:17;01:58:19;"Right."
01:58:19;01:58:24;"We're gonna talk. You're having too much fun."
01:58:24;01:58:27;"Ed, my man."
01:58:27;01:58:31;"I can totally see like in an alternate timeline,"
01:58:31;01:58:35;"Jake is just like the music critic for like a regional newspaper."
01:58:35;01:58:40;"And he just like hands in his kind of like 2021 year wrap up."
01:58:40;01:58:43;"At the end of the day this year, Ed Sheeran had a little too much fun."
01:58:43;01:58:45;"Adele didn't have enough."
01:58:45;01:58:48;"This is Jake's takes."
01:58:48;01:58:51;"For the Des Moines Register, Jake Longstreet."
01:58:51;01:58:58;"That Sheena Easton song comes on and you like see him walking to his car with his head down."
01:58:58;01:59:03;"He drives home and he feeds the dog and he has no family."
01:59:03;01:59:05;"And that's the beginning of..."
01:59:05;01:59:07;"That's the Jake timeline?"
01:59:07;01:59:12;"Yeah, it's a TV show about Jake being a music reporter."
01:59:12;01:59:14;"Being James Bond."
01:59:14;01:59:19;"In 1981. In a timeline where Ed Sheeran and Adele were also at 1981."
01:59:19;01:59:21;"Well, that's a good note to end on."
01:59:21;01:59:24;"Let's make sure everybody has kind of a weird day."
01:59:24;01:59:26;"And let's end with that Sheena Easton song."
01:59:26;01:59:28;"For your eyes only."
01:59:28;01:59:30;"Let's all stay up all day."
01:59:30;01:59:33;"And everybody stay awake all day."
01:59:33;01:59:37;"It's going to be tough listening to the Sheena Easton song again."
01:59:37;01:59:42;"Let's stay up all day."
01:59:42;01:59:45;"Alright, thanks everybody. We'll see you in two weeks."
01:59:45;01:59:48;"Thank you, Death Spot. Peace."
01:59:48;01:59:55;"For your eyes only can see me through the night"
01:59:55;02:00:03;"For your eyes only I never need to hide"
02:00:03;02:00:12;"You can see so much in me, so much in me that's new"
02:00:14;02:00:20;"I never felt till I looked at you"
02:00:20;02:00:28;"For your eyes only I'll live for you"
02:00:28;02:00:31;"You'll see what no one else can see"
02:00:31;02:00:33;"And now I'm breaking free"
02:00:33;02:00:39;"For your eyes only I'll live for you"
02:00:40;02:00:43;"The love I know you needed me"
02:00:43;02:00:46;"The fantasy you created me"
02:00:46;02:00:49;"Only for you"
02:00:49;02:00:54;"Only for you"
02:00:54;02:01:01;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
02:01:01;02:01:04;"(whispering)"
