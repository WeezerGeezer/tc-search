00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis, still in a time of crisis."
00:06;00:13;"The crew reunites via FaceTime for a FaceTime crisis in a time of crisis."
00:13;00:19;"It's only been one week since the last TC, but we couldn't possibly let you go two weeks"
00:19;00:21;"without checking in."
00:21;00:32;"This is a very unusual, very special, weekly edition of Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:32;00:34;"Beats 1."
01:20;01:21;"What's up?"
01:21;01:28;"Time Crisis, very special, entering, at least for now, a weekly mode."
01:28;01:32;"So this is the first Time Crisis we've ever done on an off week."
01:32;01:33;"It's quite historical."
01:33;01:35;"It's a world historical event."
01:35;01:36;"What's a bye week?"
01:36;01:37;"Is that like a sports thing?"
01:37;01:39;"Jake, you know what a bye week is?"
01:39;01:41;"Oh yeah, it's when a team doesn't play."
01:41;01:44;"Normally this would have been a bye week."
01:44;01:45;"Now it's game day."
01:45;01:49;"I think it's specific to football, the bye week."
01:49;01:53;"In sports that are played weekly, especially gridiron football,"
01:53;01:58;"the team that does not play at all during a given week is said to be on its bye week."
01:58;01:59;"B-Y-E."
01:59;02:01;"What does gridiron mean anyway?"
02:01;02:03;"Gridiron."
02:03;02:05;"I don't even want to know."
02:05;02:07;"Got bigger fish to fry."
02:07;02:10;"Anyway, so we're getting together again remotely."
02:10;02:13;"Seinfeld, he was in an underground parking garage."
02:13;02:16;"He didn't have very good reception, surprisingly."
02:16;02:21;"So I think he's driving his car around looking for a better place."
02:21;02:23;"He'll get back in eventually."
02:23;02:26;"I guess he's going to do this show from his car."
02:26;02:28;"I thought about going into a car."
02:28;02:30;"Just for privacy?"
02:30;02:31;"Yeah, quiet."
02:31;02:32;"But it's quiet."
02:32;02:33;"I'm in the room by myself."
02:33;02:37;"So Jake, you went to Home Depot recently?"
02:37;02:38;"Let's talk about that."
02:38;02:40;"I saw on the internet that--"
02:40;02:44;"By the way, we're recording this on Saturday, one day before."
02:44;02:48;"So who knows what might have changed between now and when this airs."
02:48;02:54;"But currently, Los Angeles is in a type of lockdown, as are a lot of places."
02:54;02:56;"New Jersey."
02:56;02:58;"It doesn't mean people can't go on the streets."
02:58;03:02;"It's kind of almost more like the government's formalizing their recommendations."
03:02;03:05;"Where they're just like, you can only go out for essential things."
03:05;03:07;"You can walk your dog."
03:07;03:10;"But when did you go to Home Depot and why?"
03:10;03:13;"That was yesterday, Friday, that I went to the Home Depot."
03:13;03:18;"Because Thursday night is when Gavin Newsom, the governor,"
03:18;03:20;"put those recommendations into place."
03:20;03:24;"That everyone stay at home except for essential travel."
03:24;03:25;"Right."
03:25;03:28;"So you went to Home Depot on the first day of the lockdown."
03:28;03:30;"Which is really called the stay-in-place order."
03:30;03:33;"So I guess my first question is, did you need something from there?"
03:33;03:37;"Or was it just your rebellious, Kid Rock style, libertarian streak?"
03:37;03:40;"Where you said, ""Governor Newsom, you cannot tell me what to do."
03:40;03:42;"I will get into my car and drive to Home Depot today."""
03:42;03:44;"Is that kind of where you were coming from?"
03:44;03:46;"Absolutely."
03:46;03:49;"[Laughter]"
03:49;03:53;"I needed to get some replacement pads for my belt sander."
03:53;03:55;"It had to happen Friday."
03:55;03:56;"Wait, really?"
03:56;03:58;"No, I'm joking."
03:58;04:02;"My painting studio is like two blocks from a Home Depot."
04:02;04:05;"Which is, I admit, very on brand for me."
04:05;04:09;"So I drove down to my studio to do some work yesterday afternoon."
04:09;04:13;"And I was parking and I was like, ""Oh, you know what?"
04:13;04:17;"I'm kind of curious about how comprehensive these recommendations are."
04:17;04:20;"I'm going to drive by the Home Depot and check out the vibe."""
04:20;04:22;"And I really thought it might be empty in there."
04:22;04:24;"And I drove by."
04:24;04:26;"Parking lot was jammed."
04:26;04:31;"There were classically 30 or 40 guys standing around looking for work."
04:31;04:33;"I was kind of blown away."
04:33;04:37;"So I just drove to the parking lot, kind of just cruised through."
04:37;04:41;"And then I got on Twitter and I was like, ""I don't really understand these directives."""
04:41;04:48;"And then people were saying hardware stores are exempt from the recommendations."
04:48;04:52;"So grocery stores are open, pharmacies are open, hardware stores are open."
04:52;04:54;"And I was like, ""Huh."""
04:54;04:56;"I understand Home Depot is in the hardware industry,"
04:56;05:00;"but there's like 300 people in that store at any given time."
05:00;05:05;"So it doesn't really conform to your classic definition of a hardware store."
05:05;05:10;"And then I noticed there's some new condos being built a block from my studio."
05:10;05:16;"And there were dudes just working yesterday, throwing up drywall and roofing."
05:16;05:21;"Right. I guess as far as jobs affected by corona,"
05:21;05:24;"at least construction, you can be outdoors,"
05:24;05:27;"and it's probably not that hard to stay six feet apart."
05:27;05:31;"But to me, it makes sense that they would count hardware stores as essential."
05:31;05:32;"Totally."
05:32;05:37;"Here's the thing, Home Depot is such a great mega store"
05:37;05:41;"that it has so many products that they're not all essential."
05:41;05:43;"Somebody's rolling up there just being like,"
05:43;05:47;"""I want my quarantine to be a little more green,"
05:47;05:51;"so I'm going to go to the nursery and get a lot of plants."""
05:51;05:55;"That's kind of inessential, but I can understand why people might feel like,"
05:55;05:59;"let's say somebody does all the repairs on their house themselves,"
05:59;06:02;"and then something breaks and you're all freaked out,"
06:02;06:05;"and you can't afford some handyman to come through,"
06:05;06:07;"or you don't have time, or you're close."
06:07;06:10;"I can understand where you might be like, ""Oh my God, my drill's not working."
06:10;06:12;"Let me hit Home Depot. I need to fix this."""
06:12;06:16;"I can understand people feel very uncomfortable not having access to that."
06:16;06:18;"But I guess what's strange with all these things,"
06:18;06:20;"you would hope that there's also directives"
06:20;06:23;"about how many people are allowed in the store at a given time."
06:23;06:28;"Right. Because I have driven past a few restaurants in the neighborhood"
06:28;06:30;"that are doing to-go orders,"
06:30;06:33;"and I notice that people will line up outside the restaurant,"
06:33;06:37;"stand four or five or six feet apart,"
06:37;06:39;"and then go in one at a time to get their food."
06:39;06:42;"But Home Depot, again, you're dealing with hundreds of people."
06:42;06:45;"I mean, that Home Depot in Lincoln Heights is always slammed."
06:45;06:47;"It's always crushed."
06:47;06:49;"So many surfaces."
06:49;06:52;"Yeah. So many metal surfaces."
06:52;06:56;"Oh, we got Seinfeld on now. Seinfeld, are you out of the garage?"
06:56;06:58;"Yeah, I'm out of the parking lot."
06:58;07:01;"Well, yeah, I hope that places like Home Depot"
07:01;07:05;"are figuring out ways to stay open, but do it in a safe way."
07:29;07:36;"A man in me will do nearly any task"
07:36;07:42;"And ask for compensation, there's a little he would ask"
07:42;07:53;"Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me"
07:53;08:00;"Sun clouds are raging all around my door"
08:00;08:06;"I think to myself I might not take it anymore"
08:06;08:16;"Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me"
08:16;08:23;"But oh, what a wonderful feeling"
08:23;08:30;"Just to know that you are near"
08:30;08:36;"Sets my heart a-reeling"
08:36;08:43;"From my toes up to my ear"
08:43;08:50;"A man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen"
08:50;08:56;"But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine"
08:56;09:07;"Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me"
09:19;09:23;"Have either of you started taking part in the Hi-Lo Challenge?"
09:23;09:25;"With all your time on your hands?"
09:25;09:27;"That's going to be my next question."
09:27;09:30;"So we challenged each other to watch the films of Billy Wilder."
09:30;09:34;"There was a moment the next day, you know, classic TC fashion."
09:34;09:38;"We record the show and the next day, don't even remember if it happened,"
09:38;09:40;"especially in these troubled times."
09:40;09:42;"The next day, it kind of flipped through my mind."
09:42;09:44;"I was like, yeah, I don't know if I'll get to that."
09:44;09:47;"But then I strengthened my resolve."
09:47;09:51;"And I'm proud to report that in the past week in my household,"
09:51;09:54;"we have watched four Billy Wilder films."
09:54;09:57;"Wow. Hats off, dude."
09:57;10:01;"Thank you. I think we might just leave it at four for now."
10:01;10:02;"What did you watch?"
10:02;10:04;"We went with the real classics."
10:04;10:09;"We watched Some Like It Hot, which is like a fun, silly one"
10:09;10:13;"where Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon have to dress up as women"
10:13;10:14;"and Marilyn Monroe's in it."
10:14;10:16;"It's like a true comedy."
10:16;10:19;"Then we watched The Apartment, which is the movie he made after that"
10:19;10:21;"with Jack Lemmon that's cool."
10:21;10:23;"It's like kind of a Mad Men vibe."
10:23;10:25;"I'm sure it's a bit of an influence on Mad Men."
10:25;10:31;"Like 1960, a guy working in this sleek, modern insurance company."
10:31;10:34;"And basically he's getting taken advantage of by the higher-up dude."
10:34;10:39;"So I want to use his apartment to have sex with their mistresses."
10:39;10:43;"So young Shirley MacLaine, who's an absolute delight."
10:43;10:46;"And then we watched Sunset Boulevard."
10:46;10:48;"Pretty incredible, dark."
10:48;10:54;"And then we watched Double Indemnity, which is kind of like a film noir murder."
10:54;10:59;"Double Indemnity and The Apartment both have a lot to do with the insurance industry."
10:59;11:01;"I like that."
11:01;11:03;"I got to say, yeah, I like Billy Wilder."
11:03;11:06;"He seems to be kind of like a cynical dude."
11:06;11:11;"All his movies are kind of funny and dark and kind of pessimistic"
11:11;11:16;"about the motivations of people, which makes them feel kind of modern in a way."
11:16;11:19;"But so Jake, how many Billy Wilder films have you watched?"
11:19;11:21;"Zero."
11:21;11:22;"Wow."
11:22;11:27;"I have not been pulling my weight, although I have been slaving over the old Wisdom playlist."
11:27;11:30;"Okay, so maybe you're pulling your weight there."
11:30;11:33;"Yeah, we'll have that ready for next episode."
11:33;11:37;"But we did watch a few Criterion Channel movies."
11:37;11:42;"I did ask Hannah if she had seen any of those Billy Wilder movies, and she'd seen them all, of course."
11:42;11:44;"Okay, right."
11:44;11:47;"And expressed little interest in re-watching them."
11:47;11:48;"Fair."
11:48;11:53;"So I watched a movie the other night called My Colt is My Passport,"
11:53;11:57;"which is a Japanese movie from 1967."
11:57;12:02;"Clearly a big influence on Tarantino and Spaghetti Westerns."
12:02;12:06;"It's sort of, I guess, contemporary with Spaghetti Westerns."
12:06;12:14;"But it's a real ham and egger of a crime thriller film."
12:14;12:16;"Very solid."
12:16;12:21;"Watch this movie, this Sean Connery movie, The Anderson Tapes."
12:21;12:22;"Anyone know it?"
12:22;12:23;"Not familiar."
12:23;12:26;"Sydney Lumet movie from 1971."
12:26;12:31;"The way Criterion sold it, they made it sound a lot cooler than it was."
12:31;12:38;"Sort of like a Sydney Lumet movie from 1971 about the early surveillance state."
12:38;12:40;"And I was like, ""Ooh, cool."""
12:40;12:43;"And then it ended up being more of an Ocean's Eleven kind of caper film."
12:43;12:44;"Right."
12:44;12:46;"Criterion can be hit and miss."
12:46;12:52;"I mean, it's a very prestigious brand,"
12:52;12:58;"but I feel like they can really kind of oversell some kind of schlocky stuff."
12:58;12:59;"Yeah, totally."
12:59;13:02;"I mean, it's always been that way."
13:02;13:06;"And I'm sure we'll see the music equivalent of it in our lifetimes."
13:06;13:11;"Maybe we already have, where you have an organization that in their library,"
13:11;13:13;"they have some truly classic stuff."
13:13;13:18;"But then also they have an interest in kind of dressing up older things from the past"
13:18;13:20;"that maybe aren't quite the same quality level."
13:20;13:22;"But they're like these historical documents,"
13:22;13:26;"and with the right graphic design and interesting blurb,"
13:26;13:29;"you can kind of make it seem a little more special."
13:29;13:31;"But actually, I respect that. That's cool."
13:31;13:36;"It's like, I don't know how relevant the idea of a compilation is these days."
13:36;13:38;"Although, like Light in the Attic and those places,"
13:38;13:40;"they still put together really cool compilations."
13:40;13:48;"But I've always thought about the day when people put together a fascinating rap rock compilation."
13:48;13:51;"We've definitely talked about it on Time Crisis, where it's kind of--"
13:51;13:53;"Yeah, you use kind of like buzzy language."
13:53;13:56;"Like even right now, Surveillance State is very buzzy."
13:56;13:57;"Right, right."
13:57;13:59;"For good reason. We live in a surveillance state."
13:59;14:04;"But you can only watch the conversation so many times."
14:04;14:08;"There's only so many just truly excellent films."
14:08;14:10;"I respect that. Look for it."
14:10;14:14;"It would be kind of like-- I bet this exists somewhere."
14:14;14:20;"Somebody writing about rap rock and seeing it through the lens of neoliberalism."
14:20;14:25;"To use another kind of relevant intellectual term."
14:25;14:28;"So it's just kind of like something about Fred Durst"
14:28;14:32;"and the aftermath of Clinton-style neoliberalism."
14:32;14:34;"You could do something like that."
14:34;14:36;"And maybe I will."
14:36;14:39;"I think you're the man for the job for that."
14:39;14:43;"Sometimes with that type of intellectual academic stuff where you're looking for connections,"
14:43;14:47;"it can be-- I mean, this is like the story of all of our lives a little bit."
14:47;14:50;"And I feel this way as a fan and an artist."
14:50;14:54;"You look for these connections between what's going on in the world"
14:54;14:56;"and the art you like and when it was made."
14:56;14:59;"And there's times where you find these connections,"
14:59;15:01;"and it really is almost mind-blowing."
15:01;15:03;"It's like a new way to see the world."
15:03;15:04;"Yeah."
15:04;15:08;"I feel like even Jake, when you and I first met over a decade ago,"
15:08;15:13;"part of why we connected and we had these great conversations with your brother Dave,"
15:13;15:18;"where we would talk about-- at that time, everybody knew a lot of music fans."
15:18;15:23;"But when you meet a music fan who would just love to talk about when something was made"
15:23;15:26;"and just like-- I feel like everybody does this now,"
15:26;15:28;"but it was kind of novel back then."
15:28;15:31;"And I think a lot of hardcore music nerds feel this way."
15:31;15:34;"When you meet somebody who wasn't just like, ""Well, here are my top five albums,"""
15:34;15:39;"but who would have the type of conversations like, ""Dude, just picture this."
15:39;15:43;"1972, Glenn Frey and Don Henley are sitting together in La--"
15:43;15:49;"like really paint the scene and be like-- or just like picture post-Watergate,"
15:49;15:51;"like the Eagles are back in the studio, man."""
15:51;15:54;"Like people who like that kind of sociological angle."
15:54;15:59;"And I still like it, but the tricky thing is that I think in the Internet era"
15:59;16:02;"where there's people incentivized to share their opinions so much,"
16:02;16:07;"I'm sure I've been guilty of it too, there's a sweet spot for finding connections."
16:07;16:11;"And then there's definitely a huge area that's the overshoot area"
16:11;16:16;"where it's like on the one hand, be like, ""Wow, when this film came out,"
16:16;16:19;"it really tapped into the anxieties of the American people"
16:19;16:21;"because they were still reeling from these events."""
16:21;16:23;"And you know, like that can be interesting."
16:23;16:26;"And then they're like, there's one step beyond where you're just kind of like,"
16:26;16:29;"""Limp Bizkit is neoliberalism,"" where you're kind of like making these"
16:29;16:33;"really specific points and you're kind of like--"
16:33;16:36;"it's like your mind's working overtime, you're finding connections where they're--"
16:36;16:40;"and maybe there are some. I'm not saying Limp Bizkit isn't neoliberal."
16:40;16:44;"And I hope we get a TC head who sends us an email who they really go through."
16:44;16:48;"Well, initially I thought in this hypothetical essay you're writing"
16:48;16:51;"that Limp Bizkit was a reaction to neoliberalism,"
16:51;16:54;"but I like them being neoliberal."
16:54;16:59;"Fred Durst's political, economic outlook was firmly neoliberal."
16:59;17:02;"Well, no, you would say that Rage Against the Machine,"
17:02;17:05;"who was sort of like one of the early rap rock bands,"
17:05;17:10;"was a reaction to neoliberalism, like coming out of like Fugazi or something."
17:10;17:14;"And then in this essay, be like, Limp Bizkit actually is just"
17:14;17:19;"the pure embodiment of neoliberalism in this dumb thesis paper we're writing."
17:19;17:22;"Right, and also neoliberalism, I don't know why--"
17:22;17:26;"For some reason it's hard for me to say. Neoliberalism is one of these words."
17:26;17:30;"I'm sure as we've been talking about it, we have some TC heads just rolling their eyes."
17:30;17:31;"Oh, absolutely."
17:31;17:35;"It's a word that bothers people because over the past few years especially,"
17:35;17:38;"it's been used in such a broad way."
17:38;17:43;"To a certain extent, the concept of neoliberalism comes from economics."
17:43;17:48;"It's like an economic concept that already goes back decades."
17:48;17:50;"Can we just define it real fast for the audience?"
17:50;17:53;"Is it just sort of like unfettered global capitalism?"
17:53;17:55;"How do you define it?"
17:55;17:59;"That's what I think. When you challenged me to come up with the real definition,"
17:59;18:04;"I think it has something to do with unfettered global free market capitalism."
18:04;18:07;"That's my basic understanding."
18:07;18:12;"The type that was really pushed by the West in the post-war era"
18:12;18:14;"onto the rest of the world."
18:14;18:16;"People who were experimenting with things like socialism,"
18:16;18:21;"making sure that the West crushed those kind of left-wing governments"
18:21;18:23;"in South America, Asia, and parts of the world"
18:23;18:27;"in favor of this kind of global free trade thing."
18:27;18:32;"For instance, you look at the 90s and it's still a huge source of debate"
18:32;18:34;"within the Democratic Party's NAFTA."
18:34;18:38;"Bill Clinton was in favor of NAFTA, which was a trade agreement"
18:38;18:43;"that probably brought cheaper goods into the US by having favorable trade terms,"
18:43;18:46;"but also helped probably close a lot of factories."
18:46;18:49;"So Bernie Sanders, he was anti-NAFTA and other people were like,"
18:49;18:51;"""Man, what's your problem?"""
18:51;18:55;"So I think on a really specific level, that's an example of a battle"
18:55;18:57;"over a neoliberal policy."
18:57;19:01;"But the way that people use it now kind of has almost become..."
19:01;19:03;"And maybe it makes sense."
19:03;19:07;"It's like an economic system eventually is reflected in culture."
19:07;19:10;"And also I think because the fact that it has the word ""liberal"" in it,"
19:10;19:13;"which is really a reference to liberal economics,"
19:13;19:15;"and then this is neoliberal,"
19:15;19:21;"but I think people use neoliberal a lot to describe a type of fake liberal."
19:21;19:25;"Even though, of course, a right-wing person could have neoliberal economic views,"
19:25;19:28;"but I think the fashionable way to use neoliberal"
19:28;19:32;"is to describe a type of fake pro-business Democrat."
19:32;19:34;"Like a Bill Clinton style."
19:34;19:37;"A Bill Clinton. But then I think at a certain point,"
19:37;19:39;"when the word becomes fashionable enough,"
19:39;19:42;"people will start to use it to describe music and individual people"
19:42;19:44;"who have nothing to do with politics,"
19:44;19:46;"where people will just be like,"
19:46;19:50;"""Ed Sheeran, he's neoliberal. That's why I like the 1975."""
19:50;19:52;"The 1975 is not neoliberal."
19:52;19:54;"""Ed Sheeran, he's a real neoliberal."""
19:54;19:57;"It's like eventually it becomes..."
19:57;20:00;"And that's where maybe people using these terms"
20:00;20:02;"start to become a little bit unfair,"
20:02;20:06;"because you could probably make the case that almost all global culture"
20:06;20:09;"that happens within an economic system,"
20:09;20:12;"a neoliberal economic system, is influenced by it."
20:12;20:15;"From Rage Against the Machine all the way to Limp Bizkit."
20:15;20:17;"And sometimes I feel like when I think about music,"
20:17;20:19;"I can really get into that mindset where I'm like,"
20:19;20:24;"""Well, the 90s, rap rock in the 90s kicked off with Beastie Boys and Rage,"
20:24;20:27;"who had true left-wing views,"
20:27;20:32;"and then it got disgustingly taken over by these dirtbags from Florida, Limp Bizkit."""
20:32;20:34;"And then there's a part of me that's like,"
20:34;20:36;"""You know what? I've got to check my biases."""
20:36;20:38;"That's a really easy story, isn't it?"
20:38;20:42;"It's like all this shit basically being put out by the same mega-corporations,"
20:42;20:48;"being played to the masses via the same giant corporate media systems."
20:48;20:50;"I don't know."
