00:46;00:49;"But picture clear"
00:49;00:54;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:54;00:57;"And so I dealt you the blow"
00:57;01:00;"One of us had to go"
01:00;01:05;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:05;01:08;"One of us is crying"
01:08;01:11;"One of us is lying"

03:49;03:52;"Time Crisis, episode 50."
03:52;03:56;"This is just insane that we've done 50 episodes of this show."
03:56;03:58;"I guess it kind of makes sense."
03:58;04:00;"We do it every two weeks."
04:00;04:02;"It's been about two years."
04:02;04:04;"These years have really been flying by, man."
04:04;04:09;"Anyway, this is a really special Time Crisis because I'm here in Los Angeles"
04:09;04:12;"where I've been living in exile for over a year."
04:12;04:18;"Normally, my co-host in LA is Jake Longstreth, but he's out of town."
04:18;04:25;"So finally, we got Despot and Cousin Asher flown out here to LA."
04:25;04:26;"Welcome, guys."
04:26;04:27;"What's up, Ezra?"
04:27;04:29;"What's up, Cousin Asher? What's up, Despot?"
04:29;04:30;"Hi."
04:30;04:32;"[LAUGHTER]"
04:32;04:36;"The energy in the room is palpable."
04:36;04:39;"I cannot believe that we got these two East Coast dudes here on the West Coast."
04:39;04:43;"Now, Despot, you come out to LA pretty frequently."
04:43;04:45;"Yeah, against my will."
04:45;04:46;"You just love it."
04:46;04:47;"Yeah."
04:47;04:48;"You got your sun time in."
04:48;04:49;"Got to get out to Malibu."
04:49;04:52;"But Asher, you haven't been to LA in over a decade."
04:52;04:53;"In over a decade."
04:53;04:57;"I went to school in LA at Occidental College,"
04:57;05:03;"and I left the day of graduation, and this is my first full day back."
05:03;05:04;"That's crazy."
05:04;05:06;"Since I graduated. Yeah, it's crazy."
05:06;05:08;"It's going to be your only full day because you've got to go back."
05:08;05:10;"Only full day. I've got to get back to the East Coast."
05:10;05:11;"This is wild, man."
05:11;05:13;"Yeah, it's crazy."
05:13;05:15;"I mean, we've got a lot of catching up to do."
05:15;05:18;"I can't believe this, the two coasts of Time Crisis reunited."
05:18;05:22;"Of course, Jake is not here, but we got Despot, Cousin Asher."
05:22;05:23;"We also got Seinfeld 2000."
05:23;05:24;"Hey, what's up?"
05:24;05:27;"You're going to have to get on the mic more today, Seinfeld."
05:27;05:30;"Okay."
05:30;05:33;"But anyway, Jake is not fully forgotten because when Jake leaves,"
05:33;05:36;"he becomes our correspondent elsewhere."
05:36;05:38;"So we're going to give Jake a call, see what he's been up to."
05:38;05:42;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis hotline."
05:42;05:45;"[phone ringing]"
05:45;05:47;"Jake, what's up?"
05:47;05:49;"Hey, I'm calling from a landline in Vermont."
05:49;05:50;"Where are you?"
05:50;05:53;"I'm at the Lake Mansfield Trout Club."
05:53;05:55;"[laughter]"
05:55;05:59;"It's about five miles outside of Stowe, Vermont."
05:59;06:03;"And actually, I drove by the Ben & Jerry's factory today."
06:03;06:05;"Oh, my God. Oh, nice."
06:05;06:07;"I know, I've got to stop in sometime this week."
06:07;06:09;"You can like, it's open to the public?"
06:09;06:11;"Yeah."
06:11;06:13;"Yeah, I went a few times as a kid."
06:13;06:18;"Yeah, they got that graveyard where you can look at all the flavors that they've retired."
06:18;06:20;"That's pretty morbid."
06:20;06:22;"Yeah, it's pretty rough."
06:22;06:23;"How are you guys?"
06:23;06:26;"Not bad. We just got in here back in L.A."
06:26;06:28;"Cousin Asher and Despot in the building."
06:28;06:31;"You and Cousin Asher have never met, and I guess you never will."
06:31;06:32;"It's never going to happen."
06:32;06:33;"At this rate."
06:33;06:35;"Maybe the 100th episode."
06:35;06:38;"Maybe on the 100th, we can finally get everybody in the same room."
06:38;06:40;"So, Jake, you got anything to report from Vermont?"
06:40;06:42;"Well, I just got here today."
06:42;06:46;"I was in Casper, Wyoming the last three days."
06:46;06:48;"Oh, you went to go see the eclipse?"
06:48;06:52;"Yep, I saw the eclipse in its totality."
06:52;06:57;"Right, so you hauled ass from Los Angeles to Casper, Wyoming because you wanted to be right in the path."
06:57;06:59;"Check it out."
06:59;07:04;"I came up with a good name for like either a rapper or some kind of rock and roll guy."
07:04;07:07;"His name is Dave Totality."
07:09;07:12;"You're like an 80s stand-up comedian who teaches you about science?"
07:12;07:15;"Because, you know, it was the day of totality."
07:15;07:17;"Dave Totality."
07:17;07:20;"Yeah, that could be like a Bill Nye type guy."
07:20;07:24;"Yeah, yeah, Dave Totality teaches you about the stars and stuff."
07:24;07:26;"So what was going on in Casper, Wyoming?"
07:26;07:30;"I saw some of your pictures. You're just like in a kind of field?"
07:30;07:34;"Yeah, Casper, Wyoming is on the North Platte River."
07:34;07:41;"And that was like a big spot for the wagons that were crossing the plains to cross the North Platte River."
07:41;07:44;"And so it's like nestled in this little valley."
07:44;07:46;"Oh, like some Oregon Trail s***?"
07:46;07:53;"Yeah. So then the day of the eclipse, we went up on this hill, this like grassy hill that overlooks the whole valley."
07:53;08:01;"It was actually right next to the Casper Events Center, which I was surprised to learn is a pretty large venue."
08:01;08:05;"So what was the scene like outside the Casper Events Center?"
08:05;08:10;"Was there like a buzz in the air? Were you, were strangers stopping strangers, making friends?"
08:10;08:14;"Yep. Really good morale. People were really pumped."
08:14;08:17;"There was a lot of like RVs parked."
08:17;08:23;"A lot of dudes, like amateur astronomers with like serious gear situations,"
08:23;08:33;"who had like been out all night with like various telescopes and like laptops balanced on folding chairs with like headphones."
08:33;08:43;"And it's like, I don't know what they were doing, but the dudes were super deep on like monitoring or like recording this eclipse event that happened."
08:43;08:51;"And so it started around 1030 in the morning is when like the first bit of the moon would like nick into the sun."
08:51;08:56;"You couldn't see it with the naked eye, you couldn't look into the sun with the naked eye, you'd be blinding obviously."
08:56;09:03;"But if you put on these eclipse glasses, like all you could see was like the silhouette of the sun."
09:03;09:10;"And then you could start to see this like black disk start to like impede and eclipse over the sun."
09:10;09:13;"And then that, and then, so that process took about an hour."
09:13;09:21;"And then it started getting darker and as wind kicked up and the temperature started dropping really quickly."
09:21;09:27;"And then right at the moment of the eclipse, which was like 1142 or something, it got super crazy."
09:27;09:31;"Like it just got really cold and like really dark really quickly."
09:31;09:35;"And then you could take off your glasses and then just look up at the sun."
09:35;09:44;"And there was just like this black disk with this like piercing white circumference around it with like this kind of like halo glow."
10:42;10:47;"At the moment of totality, what was the vibe in the field? Did people applaud?"
10:47;10:52;"Yeah, people were cheering like, ""Woo!"" Like people were like totally pumped."
10:52;10:56;"Anybody have like an acoustic guitar and a djembe? Was there music?"
10:56;11:00;"No, no music. I mean, there was music earlier in the day."
11:00;11:06;"There was like some old timers playing cowboy songs in the parking lot of the Gaffer Event Center."
11:06;11:14;"Did anybody spontaneously weep or bellow or scream when the animals freak out?"
11:14;11:17;"At the moment of totality, was there any like harsh vibes?"
11:17;11:19;"No, nothing harsh."
11:19;11:21;"No blood-curdling screams?"
11:21;11:27;"No, no like sacrifice vibes or... I didn't see any tears."
11:27;11:34;"I mean, I could see like someone kind of hamming it up and being overly emotional for their own reasons and crying."
11:34;11:39;"But I didn't see that. Everyone was just like... Everyone was just amped because there was a lot of anticipation."
11:39;11:47;"And visually, in terms of like what a full-body experience it was because the temperature dropped so much so quickly,"
11:47;11:57;"it really did not disappoint. It was a very unique, memorable, sensory, almost like animalistic experience."
11:57;12:01;"Like you really felt like, ""Wow."" The sun just like went away."
12:01;12:05;"You'd be dead in three hours. I mean, it was just like the place that just turned into an icebox."
12:05;12:07;"You know in the next eclipses?"
12:07;12:15;"Yeah, there is one in southern Chile in 2019. And then in the US, there's going to be one in seven years."
12:15;12:16;"2024?"
12:16;12:19;"Oh yeah, that's right where you are in Vermont. It's going to go through, I think."
12:19;12:21;"It's going to go through like Burlington."
12:21;12:26;"That next eclipse, the next US eclipse, is on my 40th birthday."
12:26;12:27;"Really?"
12:27;12:29;"Yeah, April 8th, 2024."
12:29;12:30;"Dude!"
12:30;12:34;"Yeah, so I was thinking maybe we get some of the fellas together. Maybe we rent a house."
12:34;12:37;"I guess I'll be 47. How surreal is that?"
12:37;12:38;"Damn!"
12:38;12:40;"47!"
12:40;12:43;"So we all going to be old as f***. Maybe we'll get a house together."
12:43;12:47;"Actually, I can't say for sure yet if it'll be appropriate to do just the fellas."
12:47;12:50;"It might have to be, maybe we'll have kids and stuff. Maybe it has to be like a family event."
12:50;12:55;"But I want to get a house in the path of totality. All you guys are invited."
12:55;12:57;"Oh my god. I love it."
12:57;13:02;"We can discuss plus ones and plus twos. We can sketch out the details later."
13:02;13:07;"But let's say April 8th, 2024. Maybe start with a breakfast around 9."
13:07;13:08;"Birthday breakfast."
13:08;13:11;"Birthday breakfast around 9. Do the eclipse."
13:11;13:14;"And then maybe get a volleyball game going in the afternoon."
13:14;13:15;"Nice, nice."
13:15;13:17;"Ping pong tournament."
13:17;13:18;"Pencil it in."
13:18;13:21;"Siri, April 8th, 2024."
13:21;13:22;"You guys say, ""Hey Siri."""
13:22;13:26;"I think I'm going to be dead. I'm almost positive."
13:26;13:34;"If you are going to be dead, Despot, I need in writing that we are legally allowed to take your bones to my 40th."
13:34;13:36;"You could scatter my ashes there."
13:36;13:40;"Oh, perfect."
13:40;13:43;"That's 10 a.m. after breakfast."
13:43;13:49;"Maybe just the ashes. Can you get ashes of particular parts of your body?"
13:49;13:52;"If you chop it up ahead of time?"
13:52;13:59;"Yeah, I mean, I'm sure it costs more money, but I'll give you my **** ashes or, you know, whatever."
13:59;14:03;"My ass ashes."
14:03;14:05;"We got Despot's **** ashes."
14:05;14:06;"Yeah."
14:06;14:07;"DDA."
14:07;14:08;"And an urn."
14:08;14:11;"Also, it's going to be on the table during the breakfast."
14:11;14:12;"So be careful."
14:12;14:14;"You can use it if you want."
14:14;14:17;"I'm going to sprinkle a little bit in everybody's omelet."
14:17;14:19;"It's going to be a lot of ashes."
14:19;14:24;"[Laughter]"
14:24;14:26;"That's going to be a lot of fun, man."
14:26;14:28;"I'm getting kind of psyched about this."
14:28;14:31;"Yeah, me too."
14:31;14:32;"I'm pumped."
14:32;14:33;"All right, that's going to be fun."
14:33;14:34;"Wait, so, Jake."
14:34;14:35;"Yeah."
14:35;14:37;"You made a Led Zeppelin playlist?"
14:37;14:38;"Oh, yeah, I did."
14:38;14:39;"So what's on the playlist?"
14:39;14:42;"Did you just go for all the hits or like what is just an intro to Led Zeppelin?"
14:42;14:46;"I tried to avoid stuff that you would typically hear on like classic rock radio."
14:46;14:50;"So there's no Black Dog or Heartbreaker."
14:50;14:52;"Yeah, no."
14:52;14:53;"No Stairway?"
14:53;14:55;"No Whole Lotta Love, no Stairway."
14:55;15:00;"It's just like all my favorite songs that are the massive hits."
15:00;15:02;"Jake's takes."
15:02;15:04;"Jake's takes presents Led Zeppelin."
15:04;15:05;"Yeah."
15:05;15:06;"All right, cool."
15:06;15:09;"Everybody can find it on the Time Crisis Show page inside Apple Music."
15:09;15:12;"A good introduction to Led Zeppelin."
15:12;15:13;"All right, Jake."
15:13;15:14;"Well, thanks for calling in, man."
15:14;15:15;"Enjoy the rest of your vacation."
15:15;15:17;"We'll see you back here for the next show."
15:17;15:18;"Awesome."
15:18;15:19;"All right, have a good one, dude."
15:19;15:20;"Nice talking to you guys."
15:20;15:21;"Peace."
15:21;15:22;"Bye, Jake."
15:22;15:23;"Bye."
18:00;18:02;"Time Crisis."
18:02;18:03;"Ezra K. Nick."
18:03;18:05;"Time Crisis crew."
18:05;18:07;"50 episodes, man."
18:07;18:08;"Y'all did it, man."
18:08;18:11;"I remember when we was up here brainstorming the joint, man."
18:11;18:12;"Salute to you and yours."
18:12;18:14;"Keep making us laugh and think."
18:14;18:15;"Time Crisis, man."
18:15;18:17;"Love from Ebro Darden."
18:17;18:19;"Your anchor here, Beats 1, New York City."
18:19;18:21;"Beats 1."
21:42;21:44;"Despot and Cousin Asher."
21:44;21:46;"Back at it again."
21:46;21:48;"Got so many questions for you guys."
21:48;21:51;"The first one is for Despot."
21:51;21:54;"[laughter]"
21:54;21:57;"To get out to Los Angeles, there's a lot of ways to come."
21:57;21:59;"Train, car, helicopter."
21:59;22:01;"You guys came on a plane."
22:01;22:02;"Yeah."
22:02;22:04;"Now, Asher, you told me your flight was seriously delayed."
22:04;22:06;"How are you keeping yourself occupied?"
22:06;22:09;"Netflix lets you download things now."
22:09;22:10;"So the day of your trip, you were like,"
22:10;22:13;"""I need to load up the iPad or the laptop."""
22:13;22:15;"I was literally in my office,"
22:15;22:17;"and it was the last thing I did before I left."
22:17;22:19;"I loaded up the iPad with--"
22:19;22:20;"Some Netflix originals?"
22:20;22:22;"Some Netflix originals."
22:22;22:25;"Burning through Twin Peaks, the original."
22:25;22:26;"Nice."
22:26;22:29;"Yeah, I had a four-hour delay on the runway,"
22:29;22:30;"getting in the air."
22:30;22:32;"Headphones in, just taking down Twin Peaks."
22:32;22:33;"Yeah."
22:33;22:34;"You got some books and magazines."
22:34;22:37;"I'm going through the Lizzie Goodman book, actually."
22:37;22:38;"Oh, Meet Me in the Bathroom?"
22:38;22:39;"Yeah."
22:39;22:40;"Oh, nice."
22:40;22:41;"Yeah, it's pretty good."
22:41;22:43;"Learning about the early 2000s indie rock."
22:43;22:45;"I'm right in the good, in the Ryan Adams Strokes zone now."
22:45;22:46;"Oh, the juicy stuff."
22:46;22:47;"Yeah, it's pretty good."
22:47;22:50;"So you got a book, you got a big old oral history,"
22:50;22:52;"you got Twin Peaks, all this stuff,"
22:52;22:54;"and that's entertaining you."
22:54;22:56;"Now, Despot, on the other hand,"
22:56;22:58;"always found this fascinating."
22:58;23:01;"When you travel, what do you take with you?"
23:01;23:02;"My clothes."
23:02;23:04;"[laughter]"
23:04;23:06;"So you pack your clothes in a duffel bag?"
23:06;23:08;"Yeah, a Filson duffel bag."
23:08;23:10;"But then how do you entertain yourself on a flight?"
23:10;23:11;"Do you load up the iPad?"
23:11;23:12;"What kind of books do you bring?"
23:12;23:14;"What kind of music do you listen to?"
23:14;23:17;"I generally stare at the seat in front of me."
23:17;23:22;"I don't turn the screen on, or I stare at my thighs."
23:22;23:26;"I've never brought headphones or used the headphones"
23:26;23:27;"that they give you on the plane."
23:27;23:28;"That part's too crazy."
23:28;23:30;"You don't bring headphones on the plane?"
23:30;23:33;"No, and I don't read on the plane, and I don't--"
23:33;23:36;"I always get a window seat, and I don't get up."
23:36;23:37;"[laughter]"
23:37;23:42;"A flight for me is like a test of strength and will,"
23:42;23:44;"and I, yeah, don't pee."
23:44;23:46;"Pure meditation."
23:46;23:49;"Yeah, and usually by the end, I'm in, like,"
23:49;23:52;"sort of rough shape, depending on how long it was."
23:52;23:54;"'Cause a flight from New York can sometimes"
23:54;23:55;"take 5 1/2, 6 hours."
23:55;23:58;"I was delayed on the runway for an hour and a half,"
23:58;24:00;"and a half hour at the gate."
24:00;24:02;"So basically, 8 hours."
24:02;24:03;"Yeah."
24:03;24:04;"You're sitting there."
24:04;24:05;"Yeah."
24:05;24:07;"You don't get antsy, or you just suppress it?"
24:07;24:09;"I suppress it, and I think about other things,"
24:09;24:12;"and on this particular flight, I had two small children"
24:12;24:14;"right in front of me who were yelling the whole time,"
24:14;24:17;"and they weren't quite babies, so they were old enough"
24:17;24:20;"to stand up on their seats and turn around"
24:20;24:21;"and yell right in my face."
24:21;24:24;"And they kept doing it, and they weren't yelling words."
24:24;24:27;"They were just, like, going, ""Ahh!"" in my face."
24:27;24:29;"And I was, like, staring at their parents,"
24:29;24:30;"like, ""What is this?"""
24:30;24:31;"Did you wish you had headphones?"
24:31;24:33;"Yeah, you need the Bose noise-canceling."
24:33;24:34;"Nah, I thought about it."
24:34;24:36;"I looked around, and I was like, ""You guys, okay,"
24:36;24:40;"you got your headphones on, maybe you got your little mask on"
24:40;24:42;"so you could sleep, whatever it is,"
24:42;24:45;"but I bet you hear a little piece of that baby,"
24:45;24:48;"like, underneath your music, and that's even worse"
24:48;24:50;"than just hearing the baby all the way."""
24:50;24:53;"I don't want to hear the baby yelling over, like,"
24:53;24:56;"I don't know, Lil Uzi or whatever."
24:56;24:57;"[ Laughter ]"
24:57;25:00;"Lil Uzi is already a yelling baby."
25:00;25:02;"[ Laughter ]"
25:02;25:04;"To me, that's a very debatable point."
25:04;25:08;"I like to experience everything completely,"
25:08;25:09;"and as it's presented to me,"
25:09;25:14;"I don't like to alter the experience of flying on a plane."
25:14;25:16;"If the experience of flying on a plane"
25:16;25:20;"is supposed to be miserable without interference,"
25:20;25:24;"then I want to experience the miserable flight."
25:24;25:28;"I respect that, but just taking to its extreme,"
25:28;25:31;"some people believe that just life on Earth is miserable."
25:31;25:32;"Yeah, it is."
25:32;25:35;"But you still live in a house."
25:35;25:37;"An apartment."
25:37;25:39;"[ Laughter ]"
25:39;25:40;"Little miserable."
25:40;25:45;"Well, I guess, yeah, I guess you kind of have an aesthetic streak."
25:45;25:47;"Like, you don't eat a lot of food, right?"
25:47;25:49;"I eat, you know, like, maybe once a day,"
25:49;25:51;"sometimes twice, though."
25:51;25:52;"And when it comes to food,"
25:52;25:54;"you don't search out the finest foods?"
25:54;25:55;"I mean, you --"
25:55;25:56;"Whoa!"
25:56;25:59;"[ Laughter ]"
25:59;26:00;"Yes, I do."
26:00;26:01;"I mean, you --"
26:01;26:02;"I eat crazy food."

28:42;28:45;"Do you think that makes living life easier?"
28:45;28:51;"Yeah, it prepares you for all of the hardships that are inevitably going to come your way."
28:51;28:55;"I guess you can never have a terrible flight if all flights are terrible."
28:55;28:56;"Yeah."
28:56;29:01;"I fly first class a lot, but then I'm just flying first class."
29:01;29:03;"I'm still not going to watch TV."
29:03;29:07;"But are you going to accept when they give you that champagne in the beginning before the flight,"
29:07;29:09;"are you going to accept that or is that too far?"
29:09;29:10;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
29:10;29:11;"That's part of it."
29:11;29:12;"Alright, alright."
29:12;29:15;"But that came with it. I didn't have to do anything."
29:15;29:17;"You would never ask for the champagne."
29:17;29:18;"No way."
29:18;29:21;"When you're on the flight, it's like hour four."
29:21;29:23;"How long is this flight?"
29:23;29:25;"Let's say it's six. New York to LA."
29:25;29:26;"Oh, so this one."
29:26;29:30;"So it's hour four. You're sitting next to some guy."
29:30;29:33;"He's just laughing his ass off, watching some--"
29:33;29:34;"Pixar movie."
29:34;29:36;"Some Pixar movie."
29:36;29:38;"It's usually that."
29:38;29:45;"And then you see another guy just like so engrossed reading a fascinating article in the Airline magazine,"
29:45;29:47;"and you're just sitting there staring."
29:47;29:53;"Are you thinking to yourself, ""This sucks,"" or you're kind of like, ""Do you have a sense of calm?"""
29:53;29:55;"I'm calm, and there's a lot to think about there,"
29:55;29:59;"because it's like, ""What's that guy reading about in the dumb airport magazine, Airline magazine?"""
29:59;30:02;"And then I'm like, ""Oh, that guy's an idiot."""
30:02;30:05;"And how about this guy watching f***ing Toy Story?"
30:05;30:07;"You're f***ing 60 years old."
30:07;30:10;"Why are you watching Toy Story? You don't have a kid with you."
30:10;30:14;"If you have a kid, your kid's f***ing 30 years old."
30:14;30:16;"Why are you watching Toy Story?"
30:16;30:17;"I think that's a big thing."
30:17;30:21;"I think a lot of adults low-key watch Pixar movies on planes all the time."
30:21;30:23;"I see it all the time."
30:23;30:24;"I've done it."
30:24;30:30;"They're watching trolls and s***, which, I mean, trolls looked all right, but I'm not going to watch them."
30:30;30:34;"Right, but so when you see this guy watching trolls, there's no part of you that almost thinks about,"
30:34;30:36;"""Man, I wish I was watching trolls too."""
30:36;30:39;"Because I might be—I'll glance over at trolls once in a while."
30:39;30:43;"How is that better? How is it better to watch trolls with no audio?"
30:43;30:46;"It's not better. It's just like, it's happenstance, though."
30:46;30:48;"I didn't put trolls on."
30:48;30:53;"I'm like, ""Oh, look at the fat troll lady. She must be the bad one because she's fat."""
30:53;30:56;"Like, all right, I understand this movie now."
30:56;30:57;"Yeah, that's fair."
30:57;30:58;"And this guy's dumb."
30:58;30:59;"So you're not bored?"
30:59;31:01;"Yeah, I'm bored."
31:01;31:04;"Okay, so you're bored. You're just embracing it."
31:04;31:08;"Yeah, I'm bored, but I can, like—look, you're just reading a book."
31:08;31:11;"That's all you got. I got all this different s***."
31:11;31:14;"I got this baby screaming in my face."
31:14;31:18;"I got a troll movie. I got your man reading the magazine."
31:18;31:20;"I got the lady handing out pretzels."
31:20;31:22;"I got whatever I want."
31:22;31:23;"Okay, fair point."
31:23;31:26;"I could do anything. Just not get up."
31:26;31:28;"The world is your in-play movie."
