00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, episode 51. Jake returns from Vermont. We'll talk about that, plus"
00:08;00:15;"weather. Cold, cold East Coast weather. All this, plus Zack Fox, the artist"
00:15;00:20;"formerly known as Booty Math. We'll also count down the top five hits of today"
00:20;00:24;"and 1980. This is a very special..."
00:24;00:32;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:32;00:38;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:38;00:46;"You were a friend who I believed, all my rightful chances."
00:46;00:53;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:53;01:00;"And so I dealt you the blow, when the boss had to go."
01:00;01:04;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:04;01:10;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:10;01:13;"Leave it on me babe."
01:13;01:19;"Time Crisis, West Coast edition restored. Jake, welcome back."
01:19;01:20;"Thank you."
01:20;01:24;"On the last episode, you were up in the wilderness in Vermont."
01:24;01:25;"Yeah."
01:25;01:28;"I was holding it down here with Deathspot and Cousin Asher. Shout out to those guys."
01:28;01:30;"Great episode."
01:30;01:32;"Thanks for calling in. Thanks for listening."
01:32;01:33;"Yeah."
01:33;01:34;"Jake."
01:34;01:34;"Absolutely."
01:34;01:39;"So when you were up in Vermont, you were staying at a kind of hotel type place where you had"
01:39;01:40;"no service."
01:40;01:41;"Yep."
01:41;01:42;"And no Wi-Fi."
01:42;01:43;"Correct."
01:43;01:47;"Sun up to sun down. You're not checking emails, you're not checking Instagram?"
01:47;01:48;"Off the grid."
01:48;01:49;"Fully?"
01:49;01:50;"Fully. Felt great."
01:50;01:53;"So you straight up didn't check your email for a week?"
01:53;01:58;"I would say every other day we would drive into town, which was like a 15 minute drive."
01:58;01:59;"And go to a cyber cafe?"
01:59;02:03;"No, we would just like park on the street in Stowe, Vermont and-"
02:03;02:05;"Oh, and then you'd have service."
02:05;02:06;"Fire up your phone."
02:06;02:09;"Right. So how did it feel to be off the grid?"
02:09;02:10;"It was amazing."
02:10;02:15;"How did you feel different? You feel like more relaxed? Did you have more mental acuity?"
02:15;02:19;"I don't know about that. I could see that happening. If like I-"
02:19;02:20;"Did you have more peace of mind?"
02:20;02:27;"I found that like checking Twitter and Instagram, it's confirmed, is a huge waste of time."
02:28;02:28;"Oh."
02:28;02:30;"Because I didn't miss it at all."
02:30;02:32;"Okay. Maybe for you."
02:32;02:37;"I didn't need to know every four hours what the new Trump news was."
02:37;02:39;"That doesn't improve your life at all."
02:39;02:40;"Right."
02:40;02:43;"Because generally if I check in, like Instagram is pretty like,"
02:43;02:45;"that can be pretty low key and innocuous."
02:45;02:49;"And it's like people's kids or like your friends or whatever."
02:49;02:53;"Like if you check the internet beyond Instagram, it's just all Trump."
02:53;02:54;"Right."
02:54;02:59;"And I don't need that all the time. Especially if I'm just kicking it by a lake in Vermont,"
02:59;03:04;"doing some fishing, doing some swimming, sitting on the porch, reading a novel."
03:04;03:06;"How about that? Sitting on a porch-"
03:06;03:08;"You sat on the porch and read a novel?"
03:08;03:12;"In a rocking chair and read the new Tom Perotta novel,"
03:12;03:15;"Mrs. Fletcher in about a day and a half."
03:15;03:17;"Was it like big text?"
03:17;03:18;"Normal text."
03:18;03:23;"Normal text. So you took down a novel. What do you call it? Current fiction?"
03:23;03:24;"Contemporary fiction."
03:24;03:27;"A contemporary fiction novel in a day and a half."
03:27;03:33;"Yep. Because if I read normally, like if I get into bed at my house in LA and I read,"
03:33;03:39;"I get into bed, I look at my phone and then I get sucked into like BS on Twitter for 12 minutes."
03:39;03:40;"Well, that's a classic thing."
03:40;03:43;"And then I read for five minutes and then I'm asleep."
03:43;03:49;"I sometimes make the excuse for myself almost like it's because I'm just such a curious person,"
03:49;03:54;"but it's also just because like, you know, I'm just a scumbag like everybody with no self-control."
03:54;03:56;"You flatter yourself. I'm curious."
03:56;03:59;"I flatter myself that I'm curious because this does happen a lot."
03:59;04:03;"I'll be reading a book, like a, you know, a real paper book."
04:03;04:04;"Yeah."
04:04;04:08;"And I'll come across a word I don't know, a reference to something."
04:08;04:12;"And I want to, you know, like Wikipedia generation, I want to check what that is."
04:12;04:15;"So then next thing you know, I'm on Wikipedia."
04:16;04:20;"Hours go by somehow I ended up back on Instagram."
04:20;04:23;"You ended up reading about like the formation of Chuck E. Cheese."
04:23;04:27;"Right. So you read a whole novel in a rocking chair."
04:27;04:28;"Yeah."
04:28;04:32;"That's what the world has come to is that you got to fly across the country."
04:32;04:37;"Surely you have novels and rocking chairs at home in LA."
04:37;04:38;"No rocking chair, but yeah."
04:38;04:41;"I try more and more to log off."
04:41;04:44;"And this place where we were staying, the Lake Mansfield Trout Club,"
04:45;04:51;"they've made the very conscious and deliberate effort to keep the internet out of that place."
04:51;04:55;"I mean, they could easily wire the place."
04:55;04:56;"Right."
04:56;05:00;"I don't know, like, I guess the management and their members there have decided to like, you know."
05:00;05:01;"Right. We don't want any internet."
05:01;05:01;"Right."
05:01;05:04;"I like the vibe sometimes when you're out somewhere"
05:04;05:07;"staying in a house or staying in a hotel or something."
05:07;05:11;"And it's not that you like are fully logged off,"
05:11;05:15;"but you're in that kind of vibe where you're like, I'll leave my phone in my room."
05:15;05:16;"Yeah."
05:16;05:19;"Because most of the time when I'm in LA or New York or something,"
05:19;05:25;"I'm staying in a residence that's too small for me to ever be more than,"
05:25;05:27;"say, 15 feet away from my phone."
05:27;05:27;"Right."
05:27;05:29;"You know, if you're like somewhere you're at like a big house."
05:29;05:30;"A big sprawling house."
05:30;05:33;"Or you're out in the country or something and you walk down to the pool."
05:33;05:36;"I love that vibe where it's like your phone is functioning,"
05:36;05:38;"but you just have that peace of mind where you can like be,"
05:38;05:41;"you know, you're in your bedroom, you look at your phone, put it down."
05:42;05:45;"Walk down to the creek, go hang out."
05:45;05:47;"And then, you know, next thing you know,"
05:47;05:50;"you've been fishing with your buddies, cracking a few cold ones."
05:50;05:52;"And then you come back to the house."
05:52;05:52;"Two hours have passed."
05:52;05:55;"You didn't have your phone on you and you're not freaking out"
05:55;05:56;"because you're in the country."
05:56;05:57;"And no one's texted or called."
05:57;05:58;"No, then you pick up the phone."
05:58;05:59;"And there's no emails."
05:59;06:00;"And that's great."
06:00;06:03;"You have a healthy haul of four to five texts and or missed calls."
06:03;06:08;"Not too many to overwhelm you, make you think that somebody died"
06:08;06:10;"and not too few to make you feel like a loser."
06:10;06:12;"Sometimes I'm relieved when I have nothing."
06:12;06:13;"Nothing."
06:13;06:15;"Sometimes that just gives me a huge sigh of relief."
06:15;06:17;"Really? You don't want to you don't like a healthy haul?"
06:17;06:18;"Sometimes I do."
06:18;06:20;"A healthy haul of four to five."
06:20;06:21;"Healthy haul of four to five."
06:22;06:25;"You came from out of nowhere."
06:25;06:29;"You came in a nick of time."
06:29;06:33;"I can't believe my luck now."
06:33;06:35;"Came to my rescue."
06:35;06:37;"I'm heaven bound."
06:37;06:41;"Whoever thought I'd meet a winner."
06:41;06:46;"You were an angel in disguise."
06:46;06:49;"Best things come unexpected."
06:50;06:52;"Out of nowhere."
06:52;06:53;"What a surprise."
06:53;06:58;"This time I hit the jackpot."
06:58;07:01;"How lucky can a guy be?"
07:01;07:06;"This time I hit the jackpot."
07:06;07:09;"Lady luck smiling on me."
07:09;07:14;"Okay, you saved my life now."
07:14;07:18;"And I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart."
07:19;07:22;"And this time I hit the jackpot."
07:22;07:26;"Now you're gonna stay mine."
07:26;07:28;"How many texts are you getting a day you think?"
07:28;07:33;"Unsolicited communication from people in your contacts hitting you up."
07:33;07:39;"Are we discounting like girlfriend, mom, dad, sibling, like inner circle?"
07:39;07:41;"Sure."
07:41;07:45;"I don't know like, well see that's the thing is like"
07:46;07:50;"I'm rarely away from my phone long enough to do that healthy haul."
07:50;07:55;"Because sometimes you know you sit on your phone and it's like next to you for an hour."
07:55;07:58;"And then it's like just go you just get every text that comes in in real time."
07:58;08:01;"And then sometimes I love these moments when I truly put it down walk away."
08:01;08:03;"I'm just saying it's harder to do."
08:03;08:09;"I walk away and then over an hour or two the text accrue and then I come back to the healthy haul."
08:09;08:13;"I don't know in a day like if I just put my phone down on a normal weekday."
08:15;08:19;"I woke up at 8am, flip my phone over, walk down to the creek."
08:19;08:21;"Come back at 8pm."
08:21;08:22;"Come back at 8pm."
08:22;08:23;"12 hours."
08:23;08:24;"On a normal weekday."
08:24;08:25;"Let's test this."
08:25;08:27;"I don't know if I can."
08:27;08:30;"I would think I'd probably have like 10 to 15."
08:30;08:33;"Discreet messages."
08:33;08:36;"Discreet text slash missed calls."
08:36;08:40;"But you know what else I'm also like counting like people I work with like my management."
08:40;08:44;"You know what yeah once you strip away people I work with"
08:44;08:49;"inner circle friends, romantic partners, and nuclear family."
08:49;08:50;"Time crisis family as well."
08:50;08:52;"And time crisis family."
08:52;08:54;"Then it's going to be the random one or two a day maybe."
08:54;08:57;"I mean what about you when you're in your studio painting"
08:57;09:00;"do you go an hour without looking at your phone?"
09:00;09:02;"Yeah."
09:02;09:03;"Two hours?"
09:03;09:05;"Yeah sometimes."
09:05;09:10;"I mean what happens is I'll be listening to music or like a podcast on my phone."
09:10;09:13;"But I'll have the phone on silent."
09:13;09:15;"So I won't even know if I'm getting things."
09:15;09:18;"So you're just plastered in Europe 72."
09:18;09:19;"Yeah."
09:19;09:21;"And when you get the text you don't get that little bing?"
09:21;09:21;"No."
09:21;09:22;"And the music goes down."
09:22;09:23;"No so you don't even know."
09:23;09:24;"No."
09:24;09:26;"All right."
11:34;11:45;"Another thing I wanted to talk about that we were talking about last weekend."
11:45;11:50;"You know we're pretty harsh on Wendy's on the program."
11:50;11:55;"We really lay into all Wendy's because we don't believe a lot of what they say in their advertising."
11:55;12:00;"But you had a kind of memory pop up that we never really talked about on this show."
12:00;12:03;"And I think the older listeners will definitely appreciate it."
12:03;12:08;"And the younger listeners it uh maybe it'll inspire them to hear about a time gone by."
12:08;12:15;"And the thing that you brought up was that Wendy's used to have salad bars."
12:15;12:16;"Yeah they used to have a salad bar."
12:16;12:17;"I totally forgot that."
12:17;12:19;"What's up with that?"
12:19;12:20;"All Wendy's?"
12:20;12:24;"With well I you know I'm not going to go to bat for that."
12:24;12:28;"But yes I remember going to Wendy's and just being like even as a kid just being like whoa."
12:28;12:35;"Just like the thing of like ranch sitting at like room temperature and like the plastic bin."
12:35;12:37;"This is a Wendy's super bar commercial."
12:43;12:43;"You've got a year on this?"
12:45;12:45;"88."
12:45;12:46;"Wait so you hear that?"
12:48;12:49;"Almost Frazier-esque."
12:49;12:52;"Oh yeah this is just like the Frazier theme song actually."
12:52;12:55;"So this guy's saying you've seen handle bars you've seen Zanzibar."
12:55;12:58;"But you've never seen anything like the Wendy's super bar."
13:12;13:15;"I wonder how much the all-you-can-eat salad bar in 88 was at Wendy's."
13:15;13:16;"That's a great question."
13:16;13:17;"$1.99?"
13:17;13:22;"Well and also the salad bar like maybe it started as a salad bar then they made the super bar."
13:22;13:27;"The super bar also seems to have spaghetti with tomato sauce."
13:27;13:29;"Okay."
13:29;13:30;"And tacos."
13:30;13:30;"Yeah."
13:30;13:33;"1988 they're showing tacos in the commercial."
13:33;13:34;"Tacos I can see."
13:41;13:42;"Wendy's used to have salad bars."
13:42;13:47;"And you made also a good point is that there used to be salad bars everywhere."
13:47;13:52;"I guess now all these places have salad but they're like pre-made or you just order the salad."
13:52;13:53;"They hand it to you."
13:53;13:57;"Yeah it's in like a pre you know it's like in like the individual package like clear plastic."
13:57;14:00;"People used to really be into salad bars."
14:00;14:02;"They really there are far fewer of them now."
14:02;14:06;"And one thing that you pointed out is there were so many salad bars in the 80s and 90s."
14:06;14:12;"That there was a salad bar thing that became part of the lexicon."
14:12;14:15;"That I wonder if the young people today have even heard about."
14:15;14:17;"Sneeze guard?"
14:17;14:18;"Yeah sneeze guard."
14:18;14:19;"Yeah sneeze guard."
14:19;14:21;"So how old are you again?"
14:21;14:22;"I'm uh 34."
14:22;14:24;"35 actually."
14:24;14:25;"I don't know why I lied."
14:25;14:25;"I'm 35."
14:25;14:27;"Do you remember sneeze guards?"
14:27;14:28;"Sneeze guards?"
14:28;14:29;"Yeah I remember."
14:29;14:30;"Did they have those up in Canada?"
14:30;14:30;"Bigly."
14:30;14:33;"Yeah they had they had the sneeze guards in Canada."
14:33;14:35;"I was just thinking about how Wendy's used to have a smoking section."
14:35;14:36;"Do you remember that?"
14:36;14:40;"But it would like there was no division so the smoke would just be wafting around the Wendy's."
14:40;14:41;"I don't remember that."
14:41;14:42;"Did you have that in USA?"
14:42;14:44;"No."
14:44;14:45;"It's the USA."
14:45;14:46;"Well."
14:46;14:47;"Wait wait hold on."
14:47;14:47;"I don't think."
14:47;14:50;"Is that a real Canadian thing that you just say in USA?"
14:50;14:52;"Is that that sounds more like a Borat thing."
14:52;14:56;"Did you have that in the United States?"
14:56;14:57;"No."
14:57;15:01;"If you went into a Wendy's in like 1985 I don't think you could smoke in there."
15:01;15:02;"Oh we had that."
15:02;15:02;"We had that."
15:02;15:05;"I wonder if Canada was more liberal with their smoking."
15:05;15:09;"And by liberal I mean more lenient with smokers."
15:09;15:10;"So when you when you were like a kid."
15:10;15:15;"I remember my mom would say you know let's go to Wendy's let's get a Dave's Big Double."
15:15;15:15;"Uh-huh."
15:15;15:16;"Or whatever."
15:16;15:17;"And I loved Wendy's."
15:17;15:18;"I'll smoke a cig."
15:18;15:20;"She wasn't smoking."
15:21;15:24;"I'll I'll smoke a Du Maurier."
15:24;15:25;"Yeah."
15:25;15:27;"Because I'm fiending for a Du Maurier."
15:27;15:29;"What's that a Canadian cigarette?"
15:29;15:31;"Canadian cigarette with the red package."
15:31;15:32;"That was like our Marlboro."
15:32;15:33;"Du Maurier?"
15:33;15:34;"Du Maurier."
15:34;15:36;"You sitting in the smoking section with your mom."
15:36;15:37;"I'm endlessly."
15:37;15:38;"Just we were just blowing smoke clouds."
15:38;15:39;"I really love Canada."
15:39;15:43;"I'm endlessly amazed how like different Ameri."
15:43;15:46;"There's just so many little details you know for places."
15:46;15:47;"Two places so similar."
15:47;15:47;"Yeah."
15:47;15:48;"And so close."
15:48;15:50;"Did they have loonies back then?"
15:50;15:51;"Uh loonies."
15:51;15:54;"Yeah I think I think I was like 10 when the loonies came in."
15:54;15:57;"And then maybe like 14 when the toonies."
15:57;16:00;"Okay so loonies and toonies for people who don't know is is the Canadian"
16:00;16:03;"uh dollar and two dollar coins."
16:03;16:04;"Oh wow."
16:04;16:05;"And it's it's a gold coin right?"
16:05;16:08;"Yeah I mean I it's gold colored."
16:08;16:10;"Right."
16:10;16:13;"Okay so she might have said Seinfeld get in the car."
16:13;16:15;"Grab a handful of loonies."
16:15;16:16;"A pack of Du Mauriers."
16:16;16:19;"We're going to Wendy's to hit the super bar."
16:20;16:21;"And smoke ourselves silly."
16:21;16:22;"I'll get you a frosty."
16:22;16:25;"I found six loonies in the couch cushions."
16:25;16:28;"Let's head over to Wendy's."
16:28;16:28;"No."
16:28;16:29;"Because I'm itching for smoke."
16:29;16:33;"I have a big plate of Wendy's linguine with clam sauce."
16:33;16:37;"Was there probably was somebody back in the day in Canada who would have said"
16:37;16:42;"""Hey Frank you got a toonie I'm going down to Tim Horton's to buy a pack of Du Mauriers."""
16:42;16:43;"Yeah yeah yeah."
16:43;16:45;"No that sounds very Canadian."
16:45;16:47;"What you just said that sounds very passable."
19:47;19:51;"I imagine Canada has lower rates of depression than or is it?"
19:51;19:52;"I always wonder about this."
19:52;19:53;"Climate though dude."
19:53;19:57;"You know what maybe it's because I like I've been we were talking about it's been in LA too long."
19:57;20:00;"I'm just like I miss the east coast so badly."
20:00;20:02;"I miss the weather. I miss the light."
20:02;20:05;"I just haven't like woken up on a cold morning."
20:05;20:06;"I had a hot cup of coffee."
20:06;20:09;"Went outside. I had to wrap a scarf around my face."
20:09;20:14;"These are all things that I know intellectually get old after a while when you're in a really cold place."
20:14;20:17;"Maybe like day 30."
20:17;20:22;"But I'm picturing Canada and I'm just picturing like young Seinfeld"
20:22;20:24;"just walking out in the freezing Montreal."
20:24;20:25;"Beautiful sunlight."
20:25;20:27;"Old Montreal."
20:28;20:30;"Stole a DeMaurier from mom."
20:30;20:32;"Got a couple Toonies in his pocket."
20:32;20:34;"It's just so appealing to me."
20:34;20:37;"Then I picture being here in LA and I just picture like baking in the sun."
20:37;20:42;"It was like you know a week ago was getting over 100 degrees."
20:42;20:44;"That harsh white LA summer light."
20:44;20:46;"Yeah but dude January here is amazing."
20:46;20:48;"Is it? I don't even remember anymore."
20:48;20:49;"Yeah."
20:49;20:51;"You're not with me at all Jake."
20:51;20:52;"You grew up in Connecticut."
20:52;20:56;"You know that east coast fall winter early spring."
20:56;20:58;"There's nothing appealing to you at all about."
20:58;21:00;"Yeah I mean for a day or two."
21:00;21:02;"I'm not nostalgic for it."
21:02;21:05;"I mean I love an east coast summer."
21:05;21:07;"If there's one season that I miss it's the east coast summer."
21:07;21:10;"I was just back in Vermont you know in August."
21:10;21:11;"That was great."
21:11;21:13;"I don't miss the winter at all."
21:13;21:15;"But what about the coziness?"
21:15;21:18;"You can get cozy at home."
21:18;21:22;"I mean you know LA it'll drop down into the 40s at night."
21:22;21:25;"Maybe the high 30s on a winter night."
21:26;21:28;"You know you're out outside for 10 minutes."
21:28;21:32;"That's you know it's a chill through your bones."
21:32;21:34;"Get inside make some tea."
21:34;21:38;"Okay cozy up throw a narco season three."
21:38;21:39;"And that sounds pretty tight."
21:39;21:43;"Ezra it sounds like you're just really hankering for east coast time."
21:43;21:45;"Yeah I know I am."
21:45;21:47;"I spent one day on the east coast this entire summer."
21:47;21:48;"Really that's it?"
21:48;21:49;"Literally one day."
21:49;21:51;"It's funny too because I think of you as an east coast guy."
21:51;21:53;"I'm an east coast guy."
21:53;21:55;"I know you are and you've been living out here for a few years."
21:55;21:57;"I've been living in exile basically."
21:57;21:58;"We've been doing the show out here."
21:58;21:59;"It's been great."
21:59;22:01;"This is like one week in LA turned into two years basically."
22:01;22:03;"So you got a taste of that crisp cool weather."
22:03;22:06;"I know I've never gone this long without some crisp cool weather."
22:06;22:09;"Well go back this fall man."
22:09;22:10;"I'll try."
22:10;22:12;"I mean yeah it's just I got too much going on here."
22:12;22:13;"Oh good."
22:13;22:14;"It's making it yeah."
22:14;22:15;"What's going on with you?"
22:15;22:17;"You have a show coming out?"
22:17;22:20;"Oh yeah we got the cartoon coming out that just got announced last week."
22:20;22:21;"We got to get Jaden on."
22:21;22:22;"Congrats."
22:22;22:23;"Thank you."
22:23;22:25;"We got to get Jaden on time crisis."
22:25;22:27;"People might not know what I'm talking about."
22:27;22:30;"Jaden Smith actor, musician, entrepreneur."
22:30;22:32;"We made a cartoon."
22:32;22:39;"I'm not calling it an anime even though we teamed up with these kind of well-known Japanese anime"
22:39;22:44;"studios and we worked very closely with Japanese storyboard artists and character designers"
22:44;22:46;"and it's in arguably the style of anime."
22:46;22:48;"I don't want to get in this whole thing."
22:48;22:49;"I'm not going to call it an anime."
22:49;22:52;"I just call it a cartoon because we're American."
22:52;22:57;"It's a cross-cultural collaboration between us and the Japanese team, the Korean team."
22:57;22:59;"Most of it was animated in Korea."
22:59;22:59;"Gotcha."
22:59;23:01;"So anyway Jaden's the star of that."
23:01;23:04;"It's called Neo Yokio and the trailer is up now."
23:04;23:06;"It's going to come out very soon on Netflix."
23:06;23:08;"But anyway I want to have Jaden on the show."
23:08;23:12;"I once was on his show because he used to have a Beats 1 radio show."
23:12;23:13;"Oh really?"
23:13;23:13;"Yeah."
23:13;23:17;"You know I was thinking we should start a new segment on this show."
23:17;23:18;"We've kind of danced around this."
23:19;23:23;"I think you and I are both very interested in the daily grind."
23:23;23:24;"Like people's routines?"
23:24;23:26;"In so many words yes."
23:26;23:28;"The routine."
23:28;23:32;"So I was thinking like we should do a segment and I know Jaden would definitely have an"
23:32;23:37;"interesting one where it's just like walk us through your typical day."
23:37;23:39;"Yeah the alarm goes off at what time."
23:39;23:40;"Yeah."
23:40;23:42;"And you're going to bed at what time."
23:42;23:44;"What should we call the segment?"
23:44;23:45;"What's your day-to-day like?"
23:45;23:46;"Oh what's your day-to-day like?"
23:46;23:47;"That's what it's called."
23:48;23:50;"That's like an NPR segment."
23:50;23:52;"Today we have actor Russell Crowe on."
23:52;23:56;"Tell me Russell what's your day-to-day like?"
23:56;23:59;"Reporting from Los Angeles, California."
23:59;24:05;"Our correspondent Joe Perry is sitting down with actor Russell Crowe for a segment called"
24:05;24:07;"What's Your Day-to-Day?"
24:07;24:08;"Walk me through."
24:08;24:10;"Well anyway we actually do have a guest today."
24:10;24:14;"We got Zach Fox formerly known as Booty Math."
24:14;24:16;"Okay that's a cool name."
24:17;24:20;"He used to be @bootymath on Twitter."
24:20;24:22;"Now he just goes by his name @ZachFox."
24:22;24:26;"He's an author, actor, radio host, art director of Awful Records."
24:26;24:28;"All-around talented dude."
24:28;24:30;"I wonder why he bailed on Booty Math."
24:30;24:31;"We got to find out."
24:31;24:33;"Let's get Zach Fox in here and I'm going to start."
24:33;24:37;"I think I want to kick off this What's Your Day-to-Day segment with Zach and then we're"
24:37;24:39;"going to follow up with Jaden on a future episode."
24:39;24:40;"Nice."
24:40;24:40;"Let's do this."
27:22;27:23;"All right."
27:23;27:25;"Now, welcome to the program, Zach Fox."
27:25;27:26;"What's up, man?"
27:26;27:30;"So you first rose to prominence as @bootymath on Twitter."
27:30;27:31;"Yeah."
27:31;27:32;"And then what?"
27:32;27:33;"You just outgrew the name?"
27:33;27:34;"No, not necessarily."
27:34;27:42;"It kind of got to a point of I wanted to just be Zach Fox."
27:42;27:43;"You know what I mean?"
27:43;27:48;"People knew me as that and literally like coming up with the name was so random."
27:48;27:55;"I think I was I smoked a resin bowl on my friend's couch watching Spice World and I"
27:55;27:57;"was like, I want to start a Twitter."
27:57;27:59;"I'd never been on social media."
27:59;27:59;"Really?"
27:59;28:01;"What year was this?"
28:01;28:02;"2013."
28:02;28:02;"Oh, okay."
28:02;28:03;"Yeah."
28:03;28:04;"So well into the Twitter era."
28:04;28:05;"Yeah, yeah."
28:05;28:05;"Well into it."
28:05;28:11;"And I just kind of jumped right in and didn't really know what the I was doing."
28:11;28:15;"I was kind of just like spouting my own humor or whatever."
28:15;28:17;"And you're @bootymath from the start?"
28:17;28:20;"From the absolute start and nothing about that has changed."
28:20;28:24;"Nothing about, you know, my personality has changed over the years."
28:24;28:30;"I was just kind of like, oh, I want to do more like that, you know, to a public eye."
28:30;28:33;"I was just like, it would be cool to just be myself for a second."
28:33;28:35;"I think that happened a lot on Twitter."
28:35;28:38;"A lot of people just say, you know, I'm just gonna be my name."
28:38;28:38;"Yeah."
28:38;28:39;"I don't need to be anything."
28:39;28:41;"I think that's what that was."
28:41;28:43;"So we got a lot to talk about."
28:43;28:49;"But first, Jake and I just came up with a new segment."
28:49;28:52;"And if you don't mind, we'd like to christen the segment with you."
28:52;28:54;"Okay."
28:54;28:57;"The segment is called, What's Your Day-to-Day Like?"
28:57;29:02;"And I think this is a great way for us to learn more about you and for our audience to kind of"
29:02;29:03;"get more of a sense of who you are."
29:03;29:03;"Okay."
29:03;29:07;"So basically, we're kind of making this up as we go along."
29:07;29:10;"I think the concept is we just want to walk through a typical day with you."
29:10;29:12;"You just tell us what happens."
29:12;29:13;"Typical weekday."
29:13;29:14;"A typical weekday."
29:14;29:15;"Yeah, that's important."
29:15;29:18;"None of that Saturday, Sunday bullsh*t."
29:18;29:18;"That's f*cking important."
29:18;29:23;"We're talking about like Tuesday, Wednesday, maybe Monday."
29:23;29:25;"Or Thursday."
29:25;29:26;"Probably not even a Friday."
29:26;29:26;"No."
29:26;29:27;"Okay."
29:27;29:29;"Because my Mondays are really..."
29:29;29:32;"Yeah, some people keep Monday as part of the weekend."
29:32;29:38;"So, okay, let's say like on a typical Tuesday or Wednesday, the heart of the working week."
29:38;29:38;"Okay."
29:38;29:41;"So we're going to start with waking up."
29:41;29:42;"Okay."
29:42;29:44;"You setting the alarm?"
29:44;29:47;"So I got like a natural circadian rhythm."
29:47;29:48;"Really?"
29:48;29:49;"I'm jealous."
29:49;29:51;"That wakes me up like eight."
29:51;29:52;"Always."
29:53;29:53;"Pretty much always."
29:53;29:54;"Eight to nine."
29:54;29:58;"And if I set an alarm, I'll wake up three minutes before it."
29:58;29:59;"Always."
29:59;30:00;"Classic."
30:00;30:00;"All the time."
30:00;30:03;"You've just been blessed with a gorgeous circadian rhythm."
30:03;30:06;"It didn't kick in until I was 25."
30:06;30:07;"I'm 26 now."
30:07;30:10;"What about when you were like 15, 16?"
30:10;30:11;"Were you like typical teenager?"
30:11;30:12;"3 p.m."
30:12;30:12;"I woke up."
30:12;30:13;"Yeah."
30:13;30:14;"3 p.m."
30:14;30:15;"I used to wake up every day."
30:15;30:16;"So you just grew up."
30:16;30:17;"You just became..."
30:17;30:19;"That's when you really became an adult was age 25."
30:19;30:20;"25."
30:20;30:20;"It just..."
30:20;30:21;"Everything stopped."
30:21;30:22;"Everything fun stopped."
30:22;30:22;"Okay."
30:22;30:26;"But do you go to sleep at a reasonable hour?"
30:26;30:26;"No."
30:26;30:29;"There's a bit of pain to this beautiful circadian rhythm."
30:29;30:30;"Absolutely."
30:30;30:38;"Because the best that I think of or the best that I ever find or do happens between 1 and 5 a.m."
30:38;30:43;"Oh, so sometimes you're just like going deep on the internet."
30:43;30:45;"Very deep, stupid going on."
30:45;30:48;"And then I'll find, you know, whatever, work on something."
30:48;30:50;"And no matter what time I go to sleep."
30:50;30:51;"Okay."
30:51;30:54;"I end up, I wake up at like 8 or 9."
30:54;30:55;"So how many hours of sleep you get?"
30:55;30:56;"Like 5, 6?"
30:56;30:57;"Man, 4."
30:57;30:57;"Like 5."
30:57;30:58;"4."
30:58;30:58;"Okay."
30:58;30:59;"High blood pressure."
30:59;31:00;"I'm dying."
31:00;31:02;"So 8 a.m."
31:02;31:08;"When your circadian rhythm wakes you up, are you like, you wake up and are you in a bad mood?"
31:08;31:10;"Because you're like, damn, I wish I was still sleeping."
31:10;31:15;"I wake up and I usually just thank whoever that I have an erection."
31:15;31:16;"Oh."
31:16;31:18;"This is a family show."
31:21;31:21;"All right."
31:21;31:22;"Well, fair enough."
31:22;31:24;"To be fair, we ask you what your day to day is like."
31:24;31:25;"Everybody's going to be different."
31:25;31:26;"That's the morning."
31:26;31:33;"When I woke up this morning and got out of bed, I had some really fresh thoughts going through my head."
31:33;31:37;"They were the thoughts that came from a wonderful dream."
31:37;31:41;"It was a vision of a world working as a team."
31:41;31:42;"It was a dream."
31:42;31:46;"Just a dream."
31:50;31:51;"Okay."
31:51;31:56;"So I'm always interested in this because I often like hang out in bed for a long time"
31:56;31:59;"between when I wake up and when my day really gets started."
31:59;32:00;"In bed."
32:00;32:01;"But."
32:01;32:02;"On the phone."
32:02;32:02;"Yeah."
32:02;32:06;"On the phone, reading articles, maybe starting to do some like emails or something."
32:06;32:08;"So you wake up."
32:08;32:10;"Then what?"
32:10;32:11;"Are you getting out of bed quickly?"
32:11;32:12;"Are you, what are you doing?"
32:12;32:12;"Taking a shower?"
32:12;32:14;"Are you just walking into the kitchen?"
32:14;32:20;"Honestly, that first, that first emotion is really, um, really visceral."
32:20;32:24;"Cause the first emotion that I have is we've established that it's sexual."
32:24;32:28;"Cause I have this almost life ending direction."
32:28;32:35;"And then the second thought I have is what bad thing happened today or what bad thing"
32:35;32:37;"happened in the time that I was asleep."
32:37;32:38;"And I'm not even joking."
32:38;32:39;"I'm like."
32:39;32:40;"Like in the world you mean?"
32:40;32:40;"Yeah."
32:40;32:41;"I'm like, what?"
32:41;32:42;"Like Trump stuff."
32:42;32:44;"Terrible thing happened."
32:44;32:48;"And, uh, you know, so by this time, three minutes."
32:48;32:48;"You're even hornier."
32:48;32:52;"So my, my three minute window of if I've set an alarm yet."
32:52;32:52;"Yeah."
32:52;32:55;"If I, if I had set an alarm, the alarm is going off."
32:55;32:56;"I look at the phone."
32:56;32:58;"I check, you know, okay."
32:58;32:59;"Wait, this is brutal."
32:59;33:02;"Would you say any M is your sexual peak?"
33:02;33:05;"I have multiple through the day."
33:05;33:09;"It kind of works like a waveform where, you know, and you're 26."
33:09;33:10;"Yeah."
33:10;33:12;"Oh, it'd be 26 again."
33:12;33:13;"It'll be 26."
33:13;33:14;"We're not at age."
33:14;33:15;"Morning boners."
33:15;33:16;"I love this."
33:16;33:18;"No, but I like this."
33:18;33:23;"So because these are the things that other radio shows are scared to talk about is just"
33:23;33:26;"the real things that happen in a person's life."
33:26;33:27;"Yeah."
33:27;33:28;"We're being very courageous."
33:28;33:30;"We're being very courageous right now."
33:30;33:31;"So brave."
33:31;33:33;"The lamestream media doesn't cover this type of."
33:33;33:35;"So, so yeah, I like this."
33:35;33:36;"I like that."
33:36;33:38;"We haven't even moved past three minutes."
33:38;33:39;"Yeah, no, it's those eyes."
33:39;33:41;"Those are the hardest moments."
33:43;33:49;"So you wake up, you're in bed, just brutally horny."
33:49;33:49;"Right."
33:49;33:52;"And I wouldn't even say I'm horny."
33:52;33:52;"I think I'm just."
33:52;33:53;"Okay, horny is not the word."
33:53;33:54;"Horny isn't the word."
33:54;33:56;"It's just filled with."
33:56;33:58;"I actually already wish I didn't say that."
33:58;34:00;"You wake up full of lust."
34:00;34:01;"This is not atypical."
34:01;34:03;"This is part of the human process."
34:03;34:05;"We're not talking about anything controversial here."
34:05;34:07;"And then I'm on my phone."
34:07;34:09;"No, but then you get filled with a sense of dread."
34:09;34:10;"Right."
34:10;34:11;"Dystopian dread."
34:11;34:14;"And then suddenly sex is the furthest thing from your mind."
34:14;34:15;"Yes."
34:15;34:15;"Okay."
34:15;34:19;"So when you start worrying, you wake up and immediately, would you call it anxiety or."
34:19;34:26;"No, it almost feels at this point, it kind of feels like a game that I'm playing."
34:26;34:30;"It's almost like, well, let's see what moves the opponents made today."
34:30;34:31;"Yeah."
34:31;34:33;"You know, I'm just like, who f***ed up?"
34:33;34:36;"Like who did something that I don't like?"
34:36;34:37;"You don't wake up with anxiety."
34:37;34:40;"That's like, what if you f***ed up?"
34:40;34:42;"I don't really experience that."
34:42;34:46;"I usually wake up and I'm like, oh, I'm doing fine."
34:46;34:47;"Oh, that's good."
34:47;34:49;"You're not, you're not like an anxious person."
34:49;34:52;"When it comes to tasks."
34:52;34:52;"Yes."
34:52;34:53;"But right."
34:53;34:54;"Overall life."
34:54;34:56;"No, I don't wake up like, you know."
34:56;35:01;"But then once you start checking the news, do you feel calm?"
35:01;35:01;"Yeah."
35:01;35:05;"I mean, there's only so much that you can fix."
35:05;35:07;"You know, we were just talking about this out there."
35:07;35:12;"There's only so much that you can like on a day to day look at that's bad."
35:12;35:15;"And there's like a hurricane and like ISIS."
35:15;35:19;"It's 830 and I'm like, well, I can't really fix any of this."
35:19;35:21;"And are you OK?"
35:21;35:23;"Well, we are you looking at your phone?"
35:23;35:25;"Did you crack the laptop?"
35:25;35:26;"Are you a tablet guy?"
35:26;35:28;"Are you three screening at this point?"
35:28;35:32;"I do kind of get the screen Trinity going some pretty quickly."
35:32;35:32;"Yeah."
35:32;35:36;"Phone screen Trinity phone laptop."
35:36;35:40;"Netflix kind of have we're getting into screen Trinity within 15."
35:40;35:41;"No eyes open."
35:41;35:41;"Oh, absolutely."
35:41;35:44;"So you crash out at 430 in a state of screen."
35:44;35:47;"You sleep three and a half hours."
35:47;35:48;"Yes, I wake up."
35:48;35:49;"You rock hard."
35:49;35:50;"Then you get back in the screen Trinity."
35:50;35:51;"Yes, yes."
35:51;35:56;"OK, then how much time might pass once we enter?"
35:56;35:57;"No days."
35:57;35:58;"This this screen Trinity."
35:58;35:59;"We're on the next day."
35:59;36:01;"But really, you're hanging in bed."
36:01;36:02;"Got the screens cranking."
36:02;36:02;"I'm hanging."
36:02;36:04;"What's the first thing you're checking?"
36:04;36:07;"Just the day's Twitter stuff."
36:07;36:07;"New York."
36:07;36:13;"All the just pile of that I didn't catch when I went to sleep at 3 a.m."
36:13;36:14;"I just I get all that in."
36:14;36:19;"So I can be ready for the day and then I cook."
36:19;36:24;"You might fire off a tweet before you've even had a bite to eat."
36:24;36:24;"Yeah."
36:24;36:25;"Before you."
36:25;36:27;"Thank you."
36:27;36:31;"Bars before you even tasted some of the sweet."
36:32;36:32;"Who?"
36:32;36:40;"Before I even ski before you even ski, you might tweet."
36:40;36:41;"You might."
36:41;36:46;"So you leave the bed."
36:46;36:47;"Yeah."
36:47;36:48;"30 to an hour."
36:48;36:50;"Let's say it's an hour after eyes open."
36:50;36:51;"Yes, I'm on like 30 percent job."
36:51;36:57;"Going down, losing steam down there."
36:57;36:58;"Next stop is the kitchen."
36:58;36:59;"Yeah."
36:59;37:00;"Or not the bathroom."
37:00;37:02;"No, nine or five."
37:02;37:03;"You're hitting the kitchen."
37:03;37:03;"Yeah."
37:03;37:05;"What are you looking for?"
37:05;37:05;"Food?"
37:05;37:06;"Yeah, I'm ready to cook."
37:06;37:07;"What do you cook?"
37:07;37:09;"I'm a pretty healthy eater."
37:09;37:12;"So like morning time, I'm kind of like a kale bowl."
37:12;37:13;"Oh, wow."
37:13;37:16;"With like a fried egg on top."
37:16;37:17;"How long does that take?"
37:17;37:19;"Quite a long time."
37:19;37:22;"If none of those ingredients are prepped, you have to massage the kale."
37:22;37:24;"You have to massage the kale."
37:24;37:26;"So you're like, and get a grease the pan."
37:26;37:27;"That's pretty low key."
37:27;37:28;"And then this."
37:28;37:28;"Yeah, it's not."
37:28;37:29;"That's not too hard."
37:29;37:30;"Well, see, that's it."
37:30;37:32;"I don't do kale in the morning, but respect."
37:32;37:34;"I need a lot of fiber."
37:34;37:39;"OK, but so in the morning you're because in the morning I find either I'm not hungry at all"
37:39;37:42;"or I'm so hungry that I couldn't possibly like start cooking."
37:42;37:44;"I'm like violently hungry in the morning."
37:44;37:45;"You're violently hungry."
37:45;37:46;"Yeah."
37:46;37:47;"The morning you're ready to start cooking."
37:47;37:49;"The morning is intense."
37:49;37:53;"The morning is when I'm most everything that a human shouldn't be."
37:53;37:56;"You're lustful, lustful, starving."
37:56;37:58;"I'll have racist thoughts in the morning."
37:59;37:59;"Wow."
37:59;38:03;"Very just terrible murder thoughts, because I mean."
38:03;38:06;"Do not talk to me until I've had my quinoa."
38:06;38:07;"Yes, I'm that person."
38:07;38:08;"I'm going to make a t-shirt for you."
38:08;38:10;"Do not talk to me until I've had my quinoa."
38:10;38:13;"And then on the back, I might be pretty racist."
38:13;38:17;"Oh, I can see the darkness in me and it's quite amazing."
38:17;38:20;"Life and death is no mystery and I want to taste it."
38:20;38:24;"Step inside of my mind and you'll find curiosity, animosity,"
38:24;38:26;"hyperlipidoxy, I can prophesize meditation."
38:26;38:29;"Reminisce on my wonder years and I wonder if"
38:29;38:32;"sentiments in my words ain't been so sincere."
38:32;38:36;"It's intimate to my nerves that I just persevere the big daughter fall"
38:36;38:37;"and don't disappear to my faith."
38:37;38:38;"They say that heaven's real."
38:38;38:40;"Analyze my demise."
38:40;38:41;"I say I'm super anxious."
38:42;38:44;"Recognize I deprive this feeling, then embrace it."
38:44;38:47;"Vandalizing these walls only if they can talk."
38:47;38:50;"Conversations don't contemplate to my dark thoughts."
38:50;38:52;"Look down on my soul now."
38:52;38:54;"Tell me I'm in control now."
38:54;38:57;"Tell me I can live long and I can live wrong and I can live right and I can sing song"
38:57;38:59;"and I can unite with you that I love, you that I like."
38:59;39:01;"Look at my life and tell me I fight."
39:01;39:02;"It's that final destination."
39:02;39:03;"It's that final information."
39:03;39:05;"It's that final inspiration."
39:05;39:06;"It's that crack, the installation."
39:06;39:09;"It's that quantum jumping, that fist pumping, that bomb detonation."
39:09;39:11;"Please don't bomb my nation."
39:11;39:12;"If I may blow away in it."
39:12;39:14;"I got my control and I'm here."
39:14;39:15;"You gonna hate me when I'm gone."
39:15;39:17;"Ain't no blood pumping, no fear."
39:17;39:18;"I got hope inside of my bones."
39:18;39:20;"It's that life beyond your own life."
39:20;39:21;"This ain't physical for mankind."
39:21;39:23;"It's that out of body experience."
39:23;39:24;"No coincidence, you've been died."
39:24;39:25;"Forget."
40:22;40:25;"Okay, let's say it's a day because I feel like a lot of people listen to Time Crisis"
40:25;40:26;"can relate to this."
40:26;40:30;"They might all of us have a kind of freelance creative lifestyle."
40:30;40:35;"So we probably have work to do every day, but it doesn't always mean we have to be in"
40:35;40:36;"one specific place to do it."
40:36;40:40;"Well, Jake, as a painter, you maybe are kind of often going to the studio."
40:40;40:45;"So let's say it's a day where you don't have any meetings necessarily."
40:45;40:47;"You're not filming anything."
40:47;40:49;"Maybe you have some work to do on the computer."
40:49;40:53;"Are you going to go to like a coffee shop?"
40:53;40:55;"You can go post up a coffee bean."
40:55;40:55;"Nope."
40:55;40:57;"I'm a desk kind of guy."
40:57;41:01;"So I'll just relocate the Trinity over to the desk."
41:01;41:02;"So you have a desk in your home?"
41:02;41:08;"Yeah, so that's the place where, you know, I feel most mobility to move."
41:08;41:13;"If I want to draw, I want to edit something, make a mix."
41:13;41:14;"Yeah, whatever."
41:14;41:15;"Okay, so I've never been good at that."
41:15;41:21;"Just like turning your home space into a workspace where you sit down, you get the devices popping"
41:21;41:23;"and you're just doing work."
41:23;41:23;"Right."
41:23;41:27;"And you feel like you can get in the zone and you can really accomplish something that way?"
41:27;41:28;"Oh, yeah."
41:28;41:32;"I mean, sometimes I clothes aren't even on at this point."
41:32;41:34;"And that might take you all the way to dinner time or what?"
41:34;41:36;"It might, depending on what happens."
41:36;41:41;"Like the other day, I was trying to mix the SpongeBob Fun song with the Playboy Cardi song"
41:41;41:44;"and also make a video to it."
41:44;41:49;"So that took up quite a long portion of my day."
41:49;41:52;"And you're just like sitting naked at your desk for four hours?"
41:52;41:56;"Yeah, and I mean, stuff like that will happen just in the spur of the moment."
41:56;41:59;"So let's say your girlfriend was left in the morning."
41:59;41:59;"Yeah."
42:00;42:03;"You wake up, cook breakfast for yourself."
42:03;42:05;"You're posted up working at your desk for five hours."
42:05;42:08;"Next thing you know, it's like 5.30 p.m."
42:08;42:09;"She might come back."
42:09;42:10;"And then she comes back and you're like, ""Great."
42:10;42:13;"It's another beautiful day."""
42:13;42:14;"Another day."
42:14;42:15;"Let's have a glass of rose."
42:15;42:16;"And then I cook dinner for her."
42:16;42:17;"Okay."
42:17;42:20;"By that point, you guys are just happy to see each other."
42:20;42:23;"And she's probably exhausted from her working."
42:23;42:27;"So you're not trying to go anywhere, just enjoying each other's companies."
42:27;42:29;"And then she falls asleep and then you have..."
42:29;42:31;"We might watch episode one."
42:31;42:32;"Four hours of 4chan until..."
42:32;42:33;"Yeah."
42:33;42:35;"Yeah."
42:35;42:37;"Precisely."
42:37;42:38;"The day it really starts."
42:38;42:41;"You were talking about those hours between one and five."
42:41;42:44;"I'm assuming that she's asleep if she left the house early."
42:44;42:45;"Yeah."
42:45;42:47;"And it's really weird because we live in a really small space."
42:47;42:50;"So I have to be kind of quiet with what I'm doing."
42:50;42:51;"So..."
42:51;42:51;"Okay."
42:51;42:53;"So I'm picturing this."
42:53;42:54;"A lot of people could picture this."
42:54;42:57;"You and your partner are in a bed together."
42:57;42:58;"Yes."
42:58;43:02;"That person, because they're on a pretty different schedule, out cold."
43:02;43:03;"Out cold."
43:03;43:05;"I have big ass headphones on."
43:05;43:08;"Like big, big ass headphones."
43:08;43:10;"Beats by Dre?"
43:10;43:10;"Yes."
43:10;43:12;"So you got your Beats by Dre on."
43:12;43:15;"You're just on your phone for like hours at night."
43:15;43:16;"Yeah."
43:16;43:19;"You say you're getting into some dark **** between one and five."
43:19;43:20;"Oh yeah."
43:20;43:20;"What are you looking at?"
43:20;43:21;"You're looking at Twitter."
43:21;43:22;"You're looking at..."
43:22;43:24;"Are you on message boards?"
43:24;43:26;"Yeah, sometimes."
43:26;43:27;"Like what's a dark message board?"
43:27;43:28;"Give me some specifics."
43:28;43:28;"Give me some specifics."
43:28;43:29;"From the last few days."
43:29;43:31;"Last night, 2 a.m."
43:31;43:32;"What are you hitting?"
43:32;43:33;"I can't even really talk about that."
43:33;43:34;"Oh my God."
43:34;43:35;"Now I'm really interested."
43:35;43:42;"Does your girlfriend know that at 2 a.m. while she's sleeping,"
43:42;43:46;"you're looking at such weird **** on your phone that you can't even say it?"
43:46;43:48;"She must wake up sometimes and just be like, ""What are you doing?"""
43:48;43:49;"Yeah, no."
43:49;43:49;"She knows."
43:49;43:51;"She'll wake up and she'll just be like, ""**** damn it."""
43:51;43:53;"Or she'll just see..."
43:53;43:57;"Because I try to stifle my laughter a lot of times."
43:58;44:01;"So if I'm laughing at something, she'll just feel my chest moving."
44:01;44:04;"She's a very light sleeper, so she'll just be like, ""Stop."""
44:04;44:04;"Right."
44:04;44:07;"But recently I found this website."
44:07;44:08;"I didn't find it recently."
44:08;44:08;"I'm lying."
44:08;44:15;"I found it back in 2010, but it's recently in the span of things."
44:15;44:17;"And it's called Chaotic."
44:17;44:23;"And it's basically the YouTube of snuff on the internet."
44:23;44:26;"So anything bad that happens in the world..."
44:26;44:27;"This is dark."
44:28;44:28;"Yeah."
44:28;44:30;"Anything bad that happened in the world that day,"
44:30;44:34;"like that I woke up and saw a headline about,"
44:34;44:39;"I can be sure to go on their website and find actual video footage of it."
44:39;44:40;"And this is just a regular website?"
44:40;44:42;"You don't need to use Tor?"
44:42;44:43;"No, no Tor."
44:43;44:48;"So what keeps you wanting to see the new ones?"
44:48;44:48;"You're searching for..."
44:48;44:53;"This weird **** that movie with damn..."
44:53;44:56;"What is that boy's name?"
44:57;44:57;"Nightcrawler."
44:57;44:59;"It's like this weird..."
44:59;45:00;"Oh, okay."
45:00;45:00;"Gyllenhaal."
45:00;45:01;"No, I mean..."
45:01;45:03;"Gyllenhaal, Gyllenhaalian."
45:03;45:06;"I think we've all been there one way or another."
45:06;45:08;"There is that weird feeling of late at night,"
45:08;45:10;"you're looking at something dark."
45:10;45:10;"Yeah."
45:10;45:14;"Well, there's this feeling of here in America,"
45:14;45:18;"we're so, so, so, so drastically removed"
45:18;45:20;"from the actual brutality of these events."
45:20;45:24;"So one might call it this weird, sick voyeurism."
45:24;45:29;"But is it voyeurism when someone who is actually in that environment"
45:29;45:31;"has to see it happen?"
45:31;45:33;"Because that happens a lot every single day."
45:33;45:36;"No, you could totally make a case that you're just like"
45:36;45:38;"experiencing the world as it is."
45:38;45:40;"Yeah, and I really feel like that's what it is."
45:40;45:44;"I'm like, no, I actually want to see what happened."
45:44;45:46;"And it's never..."
45:46;45:46;"2am."
45:46;45:47;"...enjoying it."
45:47;45:49;"Right, so 2am you're looking at..."
45:49;45:49;"How many..."
45:49;45:50;"Are you..."
45:50;45:52;"You might be on this site for like hours?"
45:52;45:53;"Or you're just like..."
45:53;45:54;"I can't handle it, man."
45:54;45:55;"A tight 15."
45:55;45:56;"I can't handle it."
45:56;45:58;"And that's just like, because I'm a soft American."
45:58;45:59;"I don't know."
45:59;46:01;"But a lot of times I look at..."
46:01;46:03;"So you're almost like testing yourself in a way."
46:03;46:05;"Can you actually handle the brutality of the world?"
46:05;46:06;"Yeah, yeah."
46:06;46:10;"And I feel like 99% of people here in this country"
46:10;46:11;"probably couldn't."
46:11;46:13;"So in a way, when you go on this website,"
46:13;46:16;"it's like, it's a really hardcore way of getting the news."
46:16;46:17;"Absolutely."
46:18;46:28;"Absolutely."
