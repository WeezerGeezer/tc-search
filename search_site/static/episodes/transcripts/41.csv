00:00;00:09;"Time Crisis, on the final day of Coachella, I will talk with Jake about this great majestic festival."
00:09;00:16;"Plus, we'll dig in to some of Wendy's claims about freshness."
00:16;00:24;"All this, plus Guided by Voices, and the top five songs of 1969 and today."
00:24;00:30;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:30;00:34;"B-B-B-B-Beasts 101."
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:41;00:48;"The world I felt, wobbly, all my rightful chances"
00:48;00:55;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:55;01:02;"And so I dealt to the floor, when a bus had to go"
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:13;01:18;"Leave the lonely bare"
01:18;01:19;"What's up, Jake?"
01:19;01:20;"Hey."
01:20;01:21;"Another Time Crisis."
01:21;01:22;"Yeah, here we are."
01:22;01:26;"The two weeks between shows, it's just enough to forget."
01:26;01:31;"You know, if it was like weekly, then it's like every week we do it."
01:31;01:33;"Two weeks, I feel like..."
01:33;01:36;"Yeah, it's like, what did we talk about last time, and what happened?"
01:36;01:38;"It vanishes, and then it's like..."
01:38;01:39;"It stays fresh."
01:39;01:41;"Fresh is a concept I want to talk about later."
01:41;01:42;"Okay."
01:42;01:43;"What does it mean to be fresh?"
01:43;01:44;"Fresh."
01:45;01:49;"But before we get into freshness, today is the last day of Coachella."
01:49;01:50;"Right."
01:50;01:55;"I think we need to talk about Coachella, which, you know, it's a two weekend extravaganza."
01:55;01:56;"Yeah."
01:56;01:57;"I've never been."
01:57;01:58;"Never."
01:58;01:59;"Nope, never been."
01:59;02:02;"It's been going on since the late 90s."
02:02;02:04;"I think early 2s."
02:04;02:05;"I think 99."
02:05;02:06;"Okay."
02:06;02:08;"Not going to fight you on it."
02:08;02:09;"About 18 years."
02:09;02:10;"Okay."
02:10;02:11;"That's crazy."
02:11;02:14;"Pretty soon, Coachella will have been happening for 20 years."
02:14;02:20;"Although, I feel like in 1999, I remember being alive in 1999 and hearing about Woodstock '99."
02:20;02:21;"Right."
02:21;02:23;"I definitely wasn't hearing about Coachella."
02:23;02:26;"Woodstock was only 30 years old at that point."
02:26;02:27;"Yeah."
02:27;02:28;"The sands of time."
02:28;02:31;"Apparently, Coachella was very mellow back in the day."
02:31;02:34;"I've heard this from like SoCal people."
02:34;02:37;"Say like when you first went to Coachella, it was like half empty."
02:37;02:39;"Just kind of walk around."
02:39;02:43;"It was mellow, like, you know, a certain type of festival."
02:43;02:45;"And now, it's kind of taken on a-"
02:45;02:46;"Burning Man level."
02:46;02:47;"Yeah."
02:47;02:48;"I mean, what is Burning Man?"
02:48;02:49;"I get people saying-"
02:49;02:50;"Never been."
02:50;02:51;"Burning Man changed too."
02:51;02:52;"It's corporate, man."
02:52;02:53;"It's still not corporate."
02:53;02:57;"I mean, Coachella, it's like, I've been to festivals all around the world."
02:57;02:59;"Coachella's a unique one."
02:59;03:00;"So, you've played it?"
03:00;03:01;"Three times."
03:01;03:02;"Wow."
03:02;03:03;"And you know what?"
03:03;03:04;"I'll probably play it again."
03:04;03:10;"Actually, I've played Coachella five times, if you count my guest appearances, also known"
03:10;03:12;"as ""cameo clowning."""
03:12;03:13;"With who?"
03:13;03:16;"Cameo clowning is a phrase that Ed Drossier from Grizzly Bear developed."
03:16;03:23;"I think cameo clowning, according to Ed or the Grizzly Bear people, cameo clowning is"
03:23;03:27;"when somebody brings you on stage for no good reason."
03:27;03:28;"Okay."
03:28;03:29;"So, maybe these weren't cameo clowns."
03:29;03:34;"I guess a classic cameo clown would be, say, we were on tour together, and I was like,"
03:34;03:36;"""Jake, man, you want to come out for the finale?"""
03:36;03:37;"And be like, ""All right, cool, man."
03:37;03:39;"Are we going to duet on something?"""
03:39;03:42;"And I'd just be like, ""Grab a tambourine and stand by the drummer, bro."""
03:42;03:44;"I think that's cameo clowning."
03:44;03:46;"Or, ""I'll rip a solo, dude."""
03:46;03:47;"Well."
03:48;03:49;"Pump the brakes on that."
03:49;03:52;"Or, like, cameo clowning would be like, ""Yo, come out and sing 'Back Up.'"""
03:52;03:53;"I've done that before."
03:53;03:56;"People have been like, ""Come out and just grab a piece of percussion."""
03:56;04:01;"But I guess a proper cameo would be more like, ""Yeah, you sing, rip a solo, rap."""
04:01;04:03;"Oh, I see."
04:03;04:05;"Cameo clowning is like, you're not actually doing anything."
04:05;04:06;"That's why it's the clowning."
04:06;04:07;"Yeah."
04:07;04:10;"It's like a rodeo clown meets a cameo."
04:10;04:14;"Once at Coachella, I sang a duet with Chromio and played a sax solo."
04:14;04:15;"Sick."
04:15;04:19;"And then once I played with Subtract, we did a song together."
04:19;04:24;"So that plus three Vampire Weekend performances, five Coachellas."
04:24;04:25;"Wow."
04:25;04:29;"So, for the Vampire Weekend shows, was that on the big stage?"
04:29;04:31;"Because I know there's three or four stages."
04:31;04:32;"Great question, Jake."
04:32;04:33;"Yeah."
04:33;04:34;"There's the main stage, of course."
04:34;04:35;"Every festival has a main stage."
04:35;04:37;"That's your Radiohead and your Kendrick."
04:37;04:38;"That's right."
04:38;04:43;"And then you've got the outdoor theater, which is kind of like the main stage junior."
04:43;04:46;"You've got your Whopper and your Whopper junior."
04:46;04:49;"So, this might be totally wrong, but it's like the main stage of the headliner."
04:49;04:52;"You might be getting like 150,000 people watching."
04:52;04:53;"Jeez."
04:53;04:55;"And maybe on the other stage, it could be more like 50."
04:55;04:56;"It's still big."
04:56;04:57;"Not bad."
04:57;04:58;"It feels big."
04:58;05:04;"So, yeah, the first time we played, we played on that second stage, the outdoor stage."
05:04;05:07;"And also, you know, when you play festivals, it's about the time of day."
05:07;05:11;"So, I think we had a nice 2 p.m. slot."
05:11;05:15;"I mean, look, if you're like a kid and you're going for the first time, you're going to"
05:15;05:18;"be probably just like rolling around all day, checking out everything."
05:18;05:23;"But then, you know, like old rich people, they're not showing up until sundown."
05:23;05:24;"Right."
05:24;05:26;"That's how rich people do Coachella."
05:26;05:32;"They're at Palm Springs, sitting by the pool, listening to probably like a low-level celebrity"
05:32;05:36;"DJ set at the Parker or something."
05:36;05:37;"Wow."
05:37;05:42;"Hanging out all day, just knocking back banana daiquiris by the pool."
05:42;05:43;"Mojitos."
05:44;05:45;"Pomegranate margaritas."
05:45;05:47;"You go swimming a little bit."
05:47;05:50;"The smell of warm colitas rising up through the air."
05:50;05:51;"Exactly."
05:51;05:54;"Maybe catch a little catnap around 430."
05:54;05:57;"Wake up around 6."
05:57;05:59;"Put on your festival clothes."
05:59;06:00;"Early dinner, maybe?"
06:00;06:02;"Some tacos on site."
06:02;06:04;"Roll over to Coachella just in time to catch."
06:04;06:05;"Black SUV."
06:06;06:09;"Uber XL."
06:09;06:12;"With like 8 times the normal pricing scheme."
06:12;06:16;"Oh yeah, you're dropping about $350 for that ride."
06:16;06:22;"And then you get to Coachella, wander around the artist area, inappropriately ask people"
06:22;06:27;"for pictures, and catch half of XX and then Radiohead."
06:27;06:29;"Then go back to the Palm Springs for parties."
06:29;06:31;"That's how some people do it."
06:31;06:35;"But my point being that when you start out and you're playing at 2pm, there's literally"
06:35;06:37;"just not everybody's at the festival yet."
06:37;06:38;"But it's cool."
06:38;06:39;"It was kind of cool playing in daylight."
06:39;06:44;"Like, our first album at least is not brutal to play during the day."
06:44;06:45;"Right, yeah I could see it working."
06:45;06:48;"You know, sometimes with the darker songs, you can hide behind darkness."
06:48;06:51;"You really put yourself out there with the cheerful songs and you know, that's why everybody"
06:51;06:52;"should have both."
06:52;06:58;"But I'm saying like at least a 2pm first album Vampire Weekend set in the blazing desert sun"
06:58;07:02;"goes down a little easier than like, you know, occasionally you see the band where it's like"
07:02;07:07;"the guys are all like wearing like black jeans, sweating, like just dropping some like harsh"
07:07;07:08;"post-punk."
07:08;07:09;"Right."
07:09;07:15;"I remember going to Lollapalooza 95 and seeing the Jesus Lizard play like a 3pm set."
07:15;07:18;"And like this, the blinding summer sun."
07:18;07:21;"I was like, and like, they were like those like pale rock club guys."
07:21;07:25;"Like they looked like guys that were like roadies at like a crappy rock club."
07:25;07:28;"And they were like sweating so much."
07:28;07:30;"And I was down with the Jesus Lizard."
07:30;07:32;"Not my favorite band, but I was like, cool."
07:32;07:35;"But that's like nighttime rock club music."
07:35;07:36;"Yeah, exactly."
07:36;07:39;"It couldn't sustain itself in the harsh light of the sun."
07:39;07:44;"It's tough for artists who make nighttime music, but don't put up nighttime numbers."
07:44;07:46;"Woo."
07:46;07:48;"So do you remember like were you actually in the sun?"
07:48;07:51;"That's one of my five rules of live music."
07:51;07:53;"You can find it in my book."
07:53;07:55;"Yes, we were just out in the sun."
07:55;07:56;"No shade."
07:56;07:57;"You were just like."
07:57;07:58;"Yeah, I was wearing."
07:58;08:00;"Direct sun rays on your guitar."
08:00;08:05;"Yeah, I was wearing plastic Ray-Bans, fake Ray-Bans as one did back then."
08:05;08:09;"Then the next time we played like we headlined that stage."
08:09;08:10;"The second stage."
08:11;08:16;"And then the third time we played third from the top on the main stage."
08:16;08:18;"So we made it to the main stage eventually."
08:18;08:20;"I guess like, let me look."
08:20;08:26;"I think the equivalent of where we played last time would be future."
08:26;08:27;"All right."
08:27;08:29;"Decent."
08:29;08:32;"Okay, so future this year played third from the last."
08:32;08:34;"On the Saturday."
08:34;08:36;"It's a fascinating festival."
08:37;08:38;"Percocet."
08:38;08:39;"Miley Percocet."
08:39;08:40;"Percocet."

09:01;09:03;"Two cups."
09:03;09:05;"Toast out with the gang."
09:05;09:08;"From footsteps to a whole nother domain."
09:08;09:10;"Out the bottom."
09:10;09:12;"I'm a living proof."
09:12;09:15;"And compromising half a million on the coup."
09:15;09:16;"Drug houses."
09:16;09:18;"Looking like Peru."
09:18;09:19;"Graduated."
09:19;09:21;"I was overdue."
09:21;09:22;"Pink Miley."
09:22;09:24;"I can barely move."
09:24;09:26;"Ask about me."
09:26;09:28;"I'm gonna bust a move."
09:28;09:29;"Red James."
09:29;09:31;"33 chains."
09:31;09:32;"Oceanair."
09:32;09:34;"Cruising big scheme."

09:36;09:39;"And compromising half a million on the coup."

10:28;10:30;"Parliament."
10:30;10:32;"Then attendance."
10:32;10:34;"Before the business."
10:34;10:36;"Theodore lenses."
10:36;10:38;"More prescriptions."
10:38;10:40;"Focus on the mission."
10:40;10:42;"Intermission."
10:42;10:44;"Never take a break."
10:44;10:46;"Switch states."
10:46;10:48;"Touchdown foreign places."
10:48;10:50;"Ain't no way."
10:50;10:52;"We come to play."
10:52;10:54;"We done come to play."
10:54;10:56;"Rob the bank."
10:56;10:58;"We gon' rob the gang."
10:58;11:00;"Miley Perkins."
11:00;11:02;"Perkins."
11:04;11:06;"Gotta rep the set."

11:32;11:34;"Gas gun."
11:34;11:36;"Never not."
11:36;11:38;"Push back against Coachella lately."
11:38;11:40;"Right."
11:40;11:44;"I'm not sure exactly why people get so mad."
11:44;11:46;"People make a lot of jokes about flower crowns."
11:46;11:50;"They're like, oh, girls go to Coachella and they wear flower crowns."
11:50;11:53;"So people are getting pissed off that people are like posers?"
11:53;11:57;"Is that what it is? It's like rich people from LA that are like--"
11:57;11:58;"Yeah, that's the classic thing."
11:58;12:04;"Have a lot of idle time and money to burn and they're just like there to be on Instagram and like look cool."
12:04;12:06;"Like lifestyle stuff. People get pissed off."
12:06;12:08;"I think that's exactly what--"
12:08;12:11;"But if they had the opportunity to do it, they would do it themselves."
12:11;12:13;"That's right."
12:13;12:15;"Punk rock's dead, so come on."
12:15;12:17;"Yeah, hey man."
12:17;12:20;"50-year-old ex-punk rocker."
12:20;12:23;"Still living in mom's basement."
12:23;12:25;"Getting on the internet."
12:25;12:29;"Hating on the beautiful young things of international wealth."
12:29;12:31;"Throwing on flower crowns."
12:31;12:39;"Enjoying Porter Robinson, Hans Zimmer, Kiara, Jack Garrett, DJ Khaled."
12:39;12:42;"They're not going to the GBV set."
12:42;12:44;"Oh yeah, well I wanted to talk about that with you."
12:44;12:49;"So probably a lot of our listeners are aware of some of the major people who played at Coachella."
12:49;12:57;"The main stage acts. Radiohead, XX, Lorde, Lady Gaga, Bon Iver, Kendrick Lamar, etc."
12:57;13:05;"But Jake was the most interested in a group that was playing on one of the smaller stages, but headlining it."
13:05;13:07;"And that's guided by voices."
13:07;13:08;"Favorite band of all time."
13:08;13:10;"This is Jake's favorite band of all time."
13:10;13:12;"Seen him like 25 times."
13:12;13:16;"We have very little information about the demographics of Time Crisis listeners."
13:16;13:17;"Right."
13:17;13:18;"We can only guess."
13:18;13:24;"We have a little info because Seinfeld 2000 mailed out membership cards to our most hardcore fans."
13:24;13:25;"Right."
13:25;13:28;"And we do know that there are people listening all over the world."
13:28;13:29;"That's all we know."
13:29;13:34;"But like, does the average Time Crisis listener know or care who Guided by Voices are?"
13:34;13:38;"I feel like they're referenced every few episodes."
13:38;13:41;"Maybe people just know them as Jake's favorite band."
13:41;13:42;"Yeah, yeah, favorite band."
13:42;13:50;"So just to contextualize it for the listeners who are not big GBV fans, they're kind of like a 90s grungy band."
13:50;13:51;"Not grungy."
13:51;13:55;"They are like the kings of indie rock."
13:55;13:56;"90s indie rock."
13:56;13:57;"They're Matador Records."
13:57;14:00;"So they're like peers of like Pavement."
14:00;14:02;"This is a song called Salty Salute."
14:02;14:07;"There's definitely somebody listening being like, this is grungy, man."
14:07;14:10;"Well, it's not like sludgy the way, it's not like metal."
14:10;14:11;"It's coming from pop."
14:11;14:12;"It's coming from."
14:12;14:13;"I didn't say metal."
14:13;14:15;"It's lo-fi basement rock."
14:15;14:16;"It's American basement genius."
14:45;14:48;"The bus will get you there."
14:48;14:49;"Yeah."
14:53;14:55;"To carry us to the lake."
14:57;14:59;"The club is open."
15:01;15:04;"Yeah, the club is open."
15:06;15:09;"Hey, the club is open."
15:11;15:14;"Come on, come on, the club is open."
15:19;15:23;"So guided by voices, this is really interesting to me that Coachella has become way more youthful,"
15:23;15:24;"I think, recently."
15:24;15:26;"I see where you're going."
15:26;15:30;"Like if you look at the three headliners, okay, Radiohead, they're no spring chickens."
15:30;15:31;"Right."
15:31;15:35;"But Lady Gaga, okay, none of these people are spring chickens, but they're."
15:35;15:37;"But they're like massive celebrity status."
15:37;15:40;"Right, Lady Gaga is a pop star."
15:40;15:44;"Kendrick Lamar is relatively early in his career."
15:44;15:45;"Yeah."
15:45;15:46;"He's only about 30."
15:46;15:51;"And then once you get into like Lorde and a lot of the other artists, you got like much younger people."
15:51;15:57;"One thing I really respect about Coachella is that when you look at it across the board,"
15:57;15:59;"there really is a lot of stuff going on."
15:59;16:01;"It's not dominated by old rock or anything."
16:01;16:03;"It's a cool mix."
16:03;16:08;"But I genuinely wonder at Coachella, who is going to see guided by voices?"
16:08;16:11;"Because to me, you're a typical guided by voices fan."
16:11;16:13;"Yeah, like I'm 40."
16:13;16:14;"Yeah."
16:14;16:16;"Like Modelo's."
16:16;16:17;"Yeah."
16:17;16:19;"And it's interesting, you've never been to Coachella."
16:19;16:22;"And probably if you die without going to Coachella."
16:22;16:23;"I'll be okay."
16:23;16:24;"Yeah."
16:24;16:26;"Well, GBV is like a legendary act."
16:26;16:28;"And Bob's old."
16:28;16:31;"It's unclear how long he'll be playing shows for."
16:31;16:32;"He's 60 years old."
16:32;16:36;"That's up there, especially for the high energy rock show they're bringing."
16:36;16:37;"Yeah."
16:37;16:38;"A lot of drinking on stage."
16:38;16:39;"A lot of leg kicks."
16:39;16:41;"A lot of jumps."
16:41;16:43;"Like Bob does stuff on stage that I can't do."
16:43;16:46;"I'm 20 years his junior."
16:46;16:47;"You couldn't pull it off either, bro."
16:47;16:51;"Oh, well, you just wait to Vampire Weekend and Coachella next year."
16:51;16:52;"Right."
16:52;16:53;"Okay, the XX are playing."
16:53;16:56;"That's kind of like washy, ambient, boring stuff."
16:56;16:58;"Radioheads get a headline."
16:58;17:03;"That's going to be more washy, ambient, let's face it, kind of boring stuff."
17:03;17:07;"So let's get in a high energy rock show."
17:07;17:09;"Let's go see this classic band GBV."
17:09;17:11;"Let's pound some brews."
17:11;17:12;"Yeah."
17:12;17:15;"Get like a nice buzz on and then go over to Radiohead and see that."
17:15;17:17;"Who's saying that?"
17:17;17:20;"A lot of people, dude."
17:20;17:27;"Just like the truth is I actually have no idea who's at Coachella because I've never gone to Coachella purely."
17:27;17:28;"As a fan."
17:29;17:36;"Even when I did those little cameos and then I would hang out, like at least I could kid myself and be like, go in there to work."
17:36;17:37;"I'm working Friday."
17:37;17:38;"Right."
17:38;17:40;"Maybe I'll take it easy on Saturday."
17:40;17:42;"But I was genuinely thinking about it."
17:42;17:45;"Like, is it one of those things where someone's like Coachella is for kids?"
17:45;17:50;"But then if you actually looked around, the average age of people at Coachella maybe is like 30."
17:50;17:51;"Sure."
17:51;17:53;"Are parents living like 13 year olds go?"
17:53;17:55;"Maybe families go."
17:55;17:56;"I bet, man."
17:56;17:57;"You know what, man?"
17:57;17:58;"You know better than me, man."
17:58;17:59;"I've never been."
17:59;18:00;"Yeah, I just don't know."
18:00;18:02;"So maybe this is it."
18:02;18:05;"It's like there is some L.A. moms and dads."
18:05;18:08;"Their 13 year old sons and daughters are begging them."
18:08;18:09;"Can we go to Coachella?"
18:09;18:10;"And they're like, you're too young."
18:10;18:12;"I'm not going to let you go camp."
18:12;18:13;"Are you crazy?"
18:13;18:14;"Right."
18:14;18:19;"And they're like, well, dad, you like Guided by Voices and Radiohead, right?"
18:19;18:20;"It's like, I sure do."
18:20;18:23;"Those are my two top favorite bands of all time."
18:23;18:24;"Madison."
18:24;18:26;"And they're playing the same night?"
18:26;18:28;"Dad, you could catch them back to back."
18:28;18:31;"You could even see Father John Misty on the front end."
18:31;18:32;"I've been reading about him."
18:32;18:38;"He seems like an interesting throwback to some of the acerbic singer songwriters that your grandfather liked."
18:38;18:39;"I like Randy Newman."
18:40;18:41;"I like Harry Nilsson."
18:41;18:42;"I like those cats."
18:42;18:49;"And then I can catch a high energy rock show, get my buzz on, and then go to Radiohead and cool out."
18:49;18:55;"Well, dad, while I'm chilling out to boring ambience, you could catch a high energy rock show."
18:55;19:05;"Dad, while I'm pumping my fist to Steve Angelo in the Sahara tent, you could be 110 over in Sonora enjoying a high energy rock show from Guided by Voices."
19:05;19:08;"The club is open."
19:08;19:09;"Actually, I love that."
19:09;19:11;"I hope there's Coachella families."
40:50;40:52;">> So Jake, back to Wendy's and the freshness."
40:52;40:53;">> Yeah, yeah, yeah."
40:53;40:57;">> After I watched this one about the fresh mozzarella chicken, I was just Googling."
40:57;41:02;"This is a major part of Wendy's brand identity is that especially their burgers are fresh."
41:02;41:04;"And for them, that means never frozen."
41:04;41:05;">> Okay."
41:05;41:09;">> And you know that the vast majority of food in America is transported frozen."
41:09;41:10;">> Sure."
41:10;41:12;">> How else are you going to get stuff all over the world?"
41:12;41:13;"You got to freeze it."
41:13;41:15;"So a lot of people don't believe it."
41:15;41:16;">> Right."
41:16;41:25;">> In fact, there was a guy who tweeted at Wendy's, you know we don't buy your never frozen BS."
41:25;41:30;"And Wendy's, who's recently hired a sassy young social media person,"
41:30;41:36;"they tweeted back at the dude like, basically like, oh, you never heard of a refrigerator, you moron?"
41:36;41:42;"And then it became this whole thing and a lot of people were writing, Wendy's epically trolled a hater."
41:42;41:44;">> Oh, my God."
41:44;41:45;">> Corporations are people, my friend."
41:45;41:46;">> Epically trolled."
41:46;41:49;">> But okay, so that's on like the front lines."
41:49;41:56;"But behind the scenes, Burger King took issue with some claims that Wendy's made."
41:56;42:01;"Wendy's in an ad claimed, our hamburgers are made with fresh never frozen beef."
42:01;42:02;"Who else can say that?"
42:02;42:04;"It's better than fast food, it's Wendy's."
42:04;42:06;">> In-N-Out can say that."
42:06;42:08;">> Yeah, well, that's a good question."
42:08;42:09;">> Not a national chain, though."
42:09;42:10;">> Maybe Burger King can't."
42:10;42:12;"There's another line from a Wendy's commercial."
42:12;42:16;"I assume the context is between a father and son."
42:16;42:20;"So, dad, you know Wendy's is dedicated to using fresh beef that's never been frozen."
42:20;42:22;"Do you realize what kind of commitment that takes?"
42:22;42:24;">> That's a chill conversation."
42:24;42:29;">> I mean, to vow to something and then to continue to live around that promise."
42:29;42:31;"A promise is only good if it is kept."
42:31;42:35;"Wendy's hot and juicy hamburgers are made with fresh never frozen beef."
42:35;42:36;"That's a promise."
42:36;42:38;"It's way better than fast food."
42:38;42:40;"It's Wendy's."
42:40;42:43;"I'm assuming that the context of the commercial was something humorous."
42:43;42:44;">> Oh, my God."
42:44;42:46;">> Otherwise, it sounds like a commercial from the '50s."
42:46;42:49;"Just like, son, what are you thinking about, son?"
42:49;42:52;"Dad, did you know that -- but anyway."
42:52;42:53;">> Oh, my God."
42:53;43:00;">> But specifically, Burger King took a complaint to the National Advertising Division of the Council of the Better Business Bureau."
43:00;43:02;"So, basically, Burger King snitched on Wendy's."
43:02;43:03;"Like, they're lying."
43:03;43:04;">> Imagine the back channels on that."
43:04;43:05;">> Yeah."
43:05;43:09;"Burger King just, like, trying to put together a bulletproof case against Wendy's."
43:09;43:20;"And specifically, Burger King singled out those two lines because you can't just go and be, like, to the National Advertising Division and go, ""Hey, guys, Wendy's,
they're, like, they're full of it, man."
43:20;43:22;"They're saying all this junk."""
43:22;43:24;"You have to go and say, like, what did they say that was a lie?"
43:24;43:26;"And Burger King singled out this line."
43:26;43:29;"So, dad, you know Wendy's is dedicated to -- whatever."
43:29;43:30;"That's what Burger King submitted."
43:30;43:31;">> Yeah."
43:31;43:44;">> And then Wendy's responded to the NAD with a thorough explanation of how the process was specifically designed to process only fresh beef and why there's no danger
of the beef temperature falling below the freezing temperature."
43:44;43:54;"The NAD reviewed it and found that the advertiser provided a reasonable basis to support the claim, ""Wendy's always fresh, never frozen,"" with respect to its burger
patties."
43:54;43:55;">> Burgers, not chicken."
43:55;43:57;">> So maybe they're lying about some of this stuff."
43:57;44:08;">> I've just read enough articles about chicken being slaughtered and processed in China and being sent frozen over in container ships over to the U.S. across the
Pacific, which is an incredible image."
44:08;44:09;">> Yeah."
44:09;44:15;">> Like, cows I could see not having to do that with because you're going to get a lot more meat from one cow."
44:15;44:17;">> Yeah."
44:17;44:18;"Well --"
44:18;44:23;">> So in the ad -- so the ad you played, it said ""freshly grilled"" specifically."
44:23;44:24;">> Well, this is --"
44:24;44:25;">> It doesn't say ""fresh chicken."""
44:25;44:26;"It says ""freshly grilled."""
44:26;44:28;">> And even with -- I just want to point out one thing."
44:28;44:35;"Even with the burgers, perhaps they're not frozen, but I also kind of wonder if it's like -- and I'd love to learn more."
44:35;44:41;"If anybody works at Wendy's, please tweet @TimeCrisis2000 and let us know."
44:41;44:48;"What I want to know is there's something fishy about their response that's like, ""We specifically designed the process to stay above the freezing temperature."""
44:48;44:49;">> Right, right."
44:49;44:50;">> And I just wonder if they're like --"
44:50;44:51;">> 33."
44:51;44:59;">> Our burgers never drop below 33 degrees in our semi-freezing shipping trucks."
44:59;45:00;">> Right."
45:00;45:03;">> And now McDonald's is saying that they're going to get in the game."
45:03;45:08;"McDonald's is now saying that they're going to start making more fresh beef burgers."
45:08;45:14;"And Wendy's tweeted at them something like, ""Oh, you're going to make some of your burgers fresh?"""
45:14;45:16;"Oh, great."
45:16;45:18;"I hate this like -- the kind of like sassy --"
45:18;45:19;">> I know. I hate it."
45:19;45:20;">> -- brand voice."
45:20;45:28;">> There's some like 26-year-old kid getting paid way too much money to run the Twitter account for this like gnarly corporation."
45:28;45:30;">> I mean, look, if that's your job, it's your job."
45:30;45:35;"The worst part is like the people who write about this stuff and be like, ""Wendy's just --"""
45:35;45:36;">> Smackdown."
45:36;45:38;">> ""Wendy's just dragged McDonald's."""
45:38;46:07;"[ Music ]"
47:05;47:27;"[ Music ]"
47:27;47:28;">> You're so crazy."
47:28;47:57;"[ Music ]"
48:55;49:05;"[ Music ]"
49:05;49:30;"[ Music ]"
49:30;49:59;"[ Music ]"
49:59;50:22;"[ Music ]"
50:22;50:24;">> There's something that jumped out to me about that phrase."
50:24;50:28;"They're basically saying, ""Our food doesn't just say fresh."
50:28;50:31;"It actually tastes like it."""
50:31;50:32;"And of course, it's advertising."
50:32;50:35;"They put thought into the -- how they constructed the sentence."
50:35;50:36;">> Every word."
50:36;50:39;">> So I was thinking, ""It doesn't just say fresh."
50:39;50:42;"It tastes like it."""
50:42;50:44;"There's something that just seemed odd to me about that."
50:44;50:45;">> That's dark."
50:45;50:47;"You know what that reminds me of is Adam Curtis."
50:47;50:49;"But this was a fantasy."
50:49;50:50;">> But this was a fantasy."
50:51;50:56;">> Well, no, remember in ""Hyper-Normalization,"" it opens with, like, that text on the black screen."
50:56;50:59;"And it just says, like, ""We know politicians lie to us."
50:59;51:01;"They know that we know."""
51:01;51:02;">> Right."
51:02;51:04;"We're all playing a big game here."
51:04;51:08;">> So, like, we all know that advertisers or fast food places are going to say, ""It's fresh."
51:08;51:10;"Subway's fresh,"" right?"
51:10;51:12;"And then we know that that's BS."
51:12;51:13;">> Right."
51:13;51:15;">> And so they're trying to get one step ahead of us."
51:15;51:18;">> Yeah, it's almost, like, Trumpian in a way."
51:18;51:24;"It's kind of like, yeah, these parties are disgusting, rich fat cats going to rip you off."
51:24;51:27;"And I'm a rich fat cat who's not going to --"
51:27;51:28;">> I know the game."
51:28;51:31;">> Yeah, I'm not going to just play the game."
51:31;51:32;"I'm going to tell you that I'm playing the game."
51:32;51:33;"It's kind of like that."
51:33;51:35;"There's, like, an element of, like --"
51:35;51:37;">> It tastes like it's fresh."
51:37;51:38;">> So, basically --"
51:38;51:40;">> I seem like I'm authentic."
51:40;51:42;">> Yeah, Wendy's, they're kind of saying here --"
51:42;51:44;">> It's super post-modern."
51:44;51:45;">> It's interesting."
51:45;51:46;"Yeah, it's very post-modern."
51:46;51:50;"McDonald's will just throw around this word ""fresh,"" right?"
51:50;51:53;"And then they'll give you something that doesn't taste fresh."
51:53;51:55;"Now, I'm going to level with you."
51:55;51:58;"Our food is no fresher than McDonald's."
51:58;52:03;"Or at least our chicken mozzarella sandwiches is no fresher than McDonald's."
52:03;52:07;"But when we call it fresh, yeah, it's a lie."
52:07;52:11;"But we're going to make sure it tastes a little fresh because I care about you."
52:11;52:13;">> It tastes like it's fresh."
52:13;52:15;">> We don't just say it's fresh."
52:15;52:19;"We work to actively give you the illusion that it's fresh."
52:19;52:20;">> What is the line?"
52:20;52:22;"What is the last line again?"
52:22;52:25;">> They're a pair that says more than fresh, they actually taste like it."
52:25;52:27;">> Mmm!"
52:27;52:28;">> Right."
52:28;52:30;"It tastes like it."
52:30;52:31;">> Who knows?"
52:31;52:34;"Maybe it is fresh and this is just, like, a poor choice of words."
52:34;52:39;"But, yeah, there's something, like, really kind of weird about that to me."
52:39;52:43;"Because that kind of makes me think, okay, some places say it's fresh and it doesn't taste fresh."
52:43;52:46;"Some places say it's fresh and it tastes fresh."
52:46;52:48;"Some places say it's fresh and it is fresh."
52:48;52:52;">> Some places it is fresh and it doesn't taste fresh either."
52:52;52:53;">> Right."
52:53;53:01;"To me that's almost like it opens up a kind of weird territory of, like, real and fake where you could be, like, you know, it's almost like Monsanto."
53:01;53:02;">> Right."
53:02;53:11;">> That would be sick if Monsanto started making commercials that was, like, you ever go down to the farmer's market and you get some organic tomato?"
53:11;53:15;"It's all tiny and shriveled up and then you bite it and it doesn't even taste that good?"
53:15;53:17;"They said it's fresh."
53:17;53:18;"It's organic."
53:18;53:19;"Who cares?"
53:19;53:22;"Come get one of our disgusting GMO --"
53:22;53:23;">> Monsters."
53:23;53:25;">> Monster tomatoes."
53:25;53:32;"And when you look at it and you see that ruby red skin and you bite into it and you just feel that flavorless wetness,"
53:32;53:39;"you're going to get so many of the signifiers of freshness and organic, you're going to regret the day you ever went down to the farmer's market."
53:39;53:41;">> Wait, does that metaphor make sense?"
53:41;53:43;">> Yeah, no, I'm in."
53:43;53:46;"I'm just tripping out on the supply line of Wendy's now."
53:46;53:49;"I'm wondering what their mozzarella situation is."
53:49;53:53;"I have a good sense of what their chicken situation is, and I'm not buying it."
53:53;53:58;">> What if Wendy's said the American people want freshness?"
53:58;54:00;"We can't freeze the burgers."
54:00;54:02;"We're going to take an L on the burgers."
54:02;54:03;"We're going to lose --"
54:03;54:04;">> That's a loss leader."
54:04;54:08;">> Yeah, we're going to lose five cents on every burger."
54:08;54:10;"It's a false flag."
54:10;54:11;">> False flag operation."
54:11;54:12;">> It's a false flag operation."
54:12;54:13;">> Ladies and gentlemen."
54:13;54:14;">> Because you know what?"
54:14;54:17;"Burgers are not even as big as they used to be."
54:17;54:19;"But we're going to wave around our burgers."
54:19;54:21;"It's very Machiavellian."
54:21;54:28;"We're going to wave around our fresh burgers knowing that the morons at Burger King and McDonald's are going to come for us because they won't believe it."
54:28;54:32;"They won't believe that we would lose a nickel on every burger."
54:32;54:43;"And then when Burger King takes us before the National Ad Council and says we don't believe you, we'll say f--- you."
54:43;54:45;"We never froze those burgers."
54:45;54:50;"And all the while, we'll lie to them about the chicken."
54:50;54:52;"Is that not a good plan?"
54:52;54:54;">> Or we won't even lie to them about the chicken."
54:54;54:57;"We're just going to skirt the issue."
54:57;54:58;">> Yeah, because we already --"
54:58;55:00;">> Freshly grilled."
55:00;55:02;">> Yeah, imagine you're the dude at Burger King."
55:02;55:09;"You're doing a beautiful mind style, all the calculations on your window, and you just realized it wasn't the burgers."
55:09;55:11;"They're lying about the chicken."
55:11;55:12;"And then you go to your higher ups like it's the chicken."
55:12;55:13;"The chicken's not fresh."
55:13;55:15;"We got to go to the National Council."
55:15;55:17;"And they're like, no, we've already been burned on the burgers."
55:17;55:18;"We can't go back."
55:18;55:21;">> You're like the rookie detective in the movie."
55:21;55:29;"And in your apartment, your sad, empty apartment, the whole wall is just full of pie charts and photographs with arrows connecting everything."
55:29;55:31;"And you're like, it's the chicken."
55:31;55:32;">> It's the chicken."
55:32;55:34;">> The whole time it's the chicken."
55:34;55:44;">> It would almost be like if I opened a fro-yo place and I was like come down to Ezra's fro-yo, because I believe in high quality ingredients."
55:44;55:52;"And that's why my original Ezra's tart flavor, which is kind of like the neutral flavor of fro-yo, is all natural."
55:52;55:55;"And I'll put it up against any of the big guys."
55:55;56:00;"And then you come in and I get people in the door with my natural tart fro-yo."
56:00;56:03;"And then everything else is just full of poison."
56:03;56:06;">> Can you imagine the Wendy's executives listening to this?"
56:06;56:08;">> Call in, guys."
56:08;56:09;"I'm not anti-Wendy's."
56:09;56:11;"I just want to know the truth."
56:11;56:40;"[ Music ]"
56:40;56:50;"[ Music ]"
59:10;59:18;"[ Music ]"
59:18;59:23;">> You're listening to ""Time Crisis"" on Beast1."
59:23;59:25;">> I believe that Wendy's probably is fresher."
59:25;59:26;"I don't think it's total bull."
59:26;59:28;"I believe that their burgers are fresher."
59:28;59:35;"What I want to know is they're still shipping it on a truck to that Wendy's in the strip mall."
59:35;59:40;"And I just want to know what does the inside of that truck look like?"
59:40;59:45;"They're setting up this thing that freezing beef is so disgusting, tastes so bad."
59:45;59:53;"Whereas realistically, high-quality beef that's been, like, frozen, if you get some, like, frozen Omaha steaks from the Omaha Steak Club."
59:53;59:54;">> I've done it."
59:54;01:00:00;">> That's going to taste way better than, you know, hormone-ed up beef that's never been frozen."
01:00:00;01:00:08;"So I'm just kind of wondering, if we got on a Wendy's truck and we looked around and then we got on a McDonald's truck and looked around, is it truly just one degree of
difference?"
01:00:08;01:00:15;"Or are we going to look at the Wendy's truck and it's going to be all clean and we're going to be like, this is beautiful, and then we get on the McDonald's truck and it's
disgusting?"
01:00:15;01:00:16;">> No, it's the same."
01:00:16;01:00:17;">> Yeah, maybe it's the same."
01:00:17;01:00:18;">> Okay."
01:00:18;01:00:19;">> I worked at Domino's and Papa John's."
01:00:19;01:00:20;">> Yeah."
01:00:20;01:00:22;">> And let me tell you, it's the exact same thing."
01:00:22;01:00:23;">> Yeah?"
01:00:23;01:00:26;">> The difference is the garlic sauce cup that you can get with Papa John's."
01:00:26;01:00:28;">> They're not pizzerias in the traditional sense."
01:00:28;01:00:31;"I guess that goes without saying, but they're more like --"
01:00:31;01:00:32;">> They're stores, Ezra."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"They're referred to as stores."
01:00:34;01:00:36;">> That's -- yeah, they're stores."
01:00:36;01:00:37;">> Yeah."
01:00:37;01:00:39;">> They're kind of like depots."
01:00:39;01:00:41;">> Yeah, it's a depot or a store."
01:00:41;01:00:43;"It's a pizza outlet."
01:00:43;01:00:44;">> Yeah."
01:00:44;01:00:46;">> Carry out and delivery only."
01:00:46;01:00:48;">> In some ways it's like a shipping center."
01:00:48;01:00:49;">> Oh, yeah."
01:00:49;01:00:57;">> It's like when you order, like, two things from Amazon, and one comes from Florida, and one comes from Austin,"
01:00:57;01:01:02;"and they probably meet at, like, a shipping depot in Charlotte, and they package them."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"I don't know."
01:01:03;01:01:09;"So all this stuff comes together at a little place in your hometown, and then the pizza comes to you, huh?"
01:01:09;01:01:10;">> Yep."
01:01:10;01:01:13;">> Really, a Papa John's is a warming station."
01:01:13;01:01:14;">> Yeah."
01:01:14;01:01:16;"There's the conveyor belt oven."
01:01:16;01:01:17;">> Right."
01:01:17;01:01:20;">> You take the pizza out, and then you take it to Cocktails and Dreams."
01:01:20;01:01:22;">> What?"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"Was that Papa John's language?"
01:01:24;01:01:29;">> No, you take the pizza to Cocktails and Dreams, which is a popular strip club about a half mile up."
01:01:29;01:01:31;">> I wish I could see that."
01:01:31;01:01:33;">> Also Club Cocoa, too."
01:01:33;01:01:35;">> So you're delivering a lot of Papa John's to strip clubs?"
01:01:35;01:01:36;">> Oh, yeah."
01:01:36;01:01:40;">> So do you get to, like, go in the back door, or you just, like, have to pull up up front?"
01:01:40;01:01:44;"There's, like, some, like, skeevy dudes waiting, and does, like, the bouncer know you?"
01:01:44;01:01:45;"He's like, ""Hey, Jake."""
01:01:45;01:01:46;">> No, not that level."
01:01:46;01:01:49;"But, yeah, like, I would just go in the front and then be like, ""Okay, go around back."""
01:01:49;01:01:51;">> Would they ID you?"
01:01:51;01:01:52;">> No."
01:01:52;01:01:53;"I was 21 then."
01:01:53;01:01:54;">> Yeah, but..."
01:01:54;01:01:55;">> Yeah, but I didn't look."
01:01:55;01:01:56;"I mean, I got ID'd last week."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"I'm 40."
01:01:57;01:01:58;">> Right."
01:01:58;01:01:59;">> I told the guy, I was like, ""I'm 40."""
01:01:59;01:02:00;">> Yeah."
01:02:00;01:02:01;">> Well..."
01:02:01;01:02:02;">> Law is the law."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"Wait, so you would go in the front door."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"Are you, like, walking past the strippers, like, holding a pizza?"
01:02:06;01:02:07;">> Mm-hmm."
01:02:07;01:02:10;"It was usually for the strippers."
01:02:10;01:02:12;">> But obviously not the stripper on stage."
01:02:12;01:02:13;">> Sometimes."
01:02:13;01:02:14;">> Really?"
01:02:14;01:02:18;">> Yeah, I would bring a pizza to Club Coco 2 in Portland at, like, 3 in the afternoon,"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"like a beautiful summer afternoon."
01:02:20;01:02:21;">> Yeah."
01:02:21;01:02:22;">> And I go in."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"There's no one in there."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"There's only a couple old dudes at the bar."
01:02:25;01:02:28;"And I'm like, ""This pizza's for -- oh, Jasmine."
01:02:28;01:02:29;"Okay, perfect."""
01:02:29;01:02:33;"And then I look, and the bartender's like, ""Okay, well, just have a seat at the bar."
01:02:33;01:02:37;"Jasmine will be with you in a few minutes when the song's over."""
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Because I look over..."
01:02:38;01:02:39;">> And she's on stage?"
01:02:39;01:02:40;">> No, she's giving a lap dance to a dude."
01:02:40;01:02:41;">> Yeah."
01:02:41;01:02:42;">> It's like some, like, mystical song or something."
01:02:42;01:02:43;"That ends."
01:02:43;01:02:45;"The guy is, like, feeling it so hard."
01:02:45;01:02:47;"He throws out another 20."
01:02:47;01:02:48;">> Oh, no."
01:02:48;01:02:50;">> The next song starts up."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"And I'm, like, hanging out."
01:02:52;01:02:55;"I'm literally wearing a Papa John's green windbreaker."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"[ Laughter ]"
01:02:57;01:02:59;">> And, like, a pink polo shirt."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"3 in the afternoon."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"And so the next song starts."
01:03:03;01:03:06;"And then I think some other bartender came in and was just like, ""All right, I'll just"
01:03:06;01:03:07;"cover that for Jasmine."""
01:03:07;01:03:09;"And gives me, like, a 20."
01:03:09;01:03:10;">> Oh, really?"
01:03:10;01:03:11;">> Yeah."
01:03:11;01:03:15;">> I think I'm going to have to walk over and do a lap dance and be like, ""Jasmine, excuse"
01:03:15;01:03:16;"me, sir."
01:03:16;01:03:17;"Sorry to interrupt."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"That'll be $9.95."""
01:03:18;01:03:21;">> I got your meatlover's combo."
01:03:21;01:03:25;">> Well, shout out to Jasmine."
01:03:25;01:03:29;"I mean, yeah, people got to remember that, like, you know, stripping's a job like any"
01:03:29;01:03:30;"other."
01:03:30;01:03:31;">> Yeah."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"And I think the bartender did not want to break the spell."
01:03:32;01:03:35;"I didn't think -- you know, I think the bartender did not want to just shout out, like, ""Jasmine,"
01:03:35;01:03:36;"your pizza's here."""
01:03:36;01:03:37;">> Right."
01:03:38;01:03:42;">> The bartender wanted, like, me to kind of lay back, be discreet, not shatter the"
01:03:42;01:03:43;"fantasy for the man."
01:03:43;01:03:44;">> Right."
01:03:44;01:03:45;">> Getting the lap dance."
01:03:45;01:03:50;">> Yeah, because I guess part of a strip club is creating this kind of, like, fantasy where"
01:03:50;01:03:51;"people --"
01:03:51;01:03:52;">> Fantasy."
01:03:52;01:03:55;">> Yeah, people just want to be in the moment."
01:03:55;01:03:58;"They don't want to think about their own life."
01:03:58;01:04:01;"They don't want to think about the performer's life."
01:04:01;01:04:05;"And, you know, eating a Papa John's pizza is such a basic part of life that, yeah, that"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"would definitely break the spell."
01:04:07;01:04:12;"So, anyway, shout out to all the hardworking strippers out there and the patrons, too, because"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"it's a whole ecosystem."
01:04:14;01:04:19;"And shout out to the pizza delivery guys, the unsung heroes of the strip world."

01:51:31;01:51:34;">> And he's like supposed to be like triggering like some weird ""do"" sounds."
01:51:34;01:51:35;">> Yeah."
01:51:35;01:51:36;">> But he just keeps hitting the wrong one by accident."
01:51:36;01:51:41;"So it's just like throughout the show, just like every time Tom York sits down."
01:51:41;01:51:43;"[laughter]"
01:51:43;01:51:48;"[singing]"
01:51:48;01:51:51;">> Oh, [bleep] off."
01:51:51;01:51:52;"Sorry, Tom."
01:51:52;01:51:53;"[laughter]"
01:51:53;01:51:57;">> Backstage pre-show, Johnny's got his Beats by Dre headphones on."
01:51:57;01:51:58;">> Just listening to this."
01:51:58;01:52:00;">> Like super intense expression."
01:52:00;01:52:01;"He's like super focused."
01:52:01;01:52:02;">> Yeah."
01:52:04;01:52:05;"What are you listening to, Johnny?"
01:52:05;01:52:07;">> Oh, nothing."
01:52:07;01:52:12;">> These Bartok piano concertos."
01:52:12;01:52:13;">> That'd be a good--"
01:52:13;01:52:14;">> Eric Satie."
01:52:14;01:52:15;">> That'd be a good movie."
01:52:15;01:52:19;"It's like British band comes to America."
01:52:19;01:52:21;"The singer's super cranky."
01:52:21;01:52:24;"Doesn't want to be on tour."
01:52:24;01:52:25;"Oh, and he hates Miami."
01:52:25;01:52:27;"He's really pale."
01:52:27;01:52:30;"All the other guys are like, ""Hey, dude, you want to like go down to the beach?"""
01:52:30;01:52:36;"And he's like, ""Why? So I can get burned, get sand in my shoes?"""
01:52:36;01:52:38;"""No, I don't want to."""
01:52:38;01:52:40;"And then they're like, ""All right, man."""
01:52:40;01:52:41;"They're all having a good time."
01:52:41;01:52:42;"He's alone."
01:52:42;01:52:45;"And then he's like, ""I can't wait to get out of Miami."
01:52:45;01:52:47;"I don't like it here."""
01:52:47;01:52:49;"And they're like, ""Well, you know, tour bus leaving in the morning."""
01:52:49;01:52:50;"I don't know."
01:52:50;01:52:51;"Then there's like a hurricane in Alabama."
01:52:51;01:52:52;"They can't leave."
01:52:52;01:52:53;">> Right."
01:52:53;01:52:54;">> Got to spend another few days there."
01:52:54;01:52:58;">> The lightproof curtains in the hotel room just drawn."
01:52:58;01:52:59;">> Yeah."
01:52:59;01:53:01;">> For days on end."
01:53:01;01:53:05;">> And then finally he's like, ""Well, I'm not going to leave my room because I don't like Miami."
01:53:05;01:53:07;"I don't like the beach."
01:53:07;01:53:09;"I don't like Cuban sandwiches."
01:53:09;01:53:12;"And I don't like people having fun."""
01:53:12;01:53:14;"And then he's just ordering room service."
01:53:14;01:53:16;"And then maybe --"
01:53:16;01:53:18;">> Just like deep vegan food."
01:53:18;01:53:21;"[ Laughter ]"
01:53:21;01:53:23;">> Take the chicken out of the Caesar salad."
01:53:23;01:53:24;">> Yeah."
01:53:24;01:53:26;"Vegan Cuban sandwich."
01:53:26;01:53:31;">> But then he starts to develop a rapport with the woman from room service."
01:53:31;01:53:32;">> Right."
01:53:32;01:53:35;">> And she's like, ""Miami's beautiful."
01:53:35;01:53:36;"You should like get out and see it."""
01:53:36;01:53:38;"And he's like, ""At first, whatever."""
01:53:38;01:53:39;"And then whatever."
01:53:39;01:53:42;"Finally she gets him to come out, introduce him to her family."
01:53:42;01:53:43;"A lot of ups and downs."
01:53:43;01:53:47;"Maybe like a drug dealer tries to kill him and they go on an adventure."
01:53:47;01:53:51;"And then he comes out and he learns how to be a good person and stop being so cranky and stuff."
01:53:51;01:53:59;"And then the final scene is like the tour manager being like, ""Well, Tom, your dream came true."
01:53:59;01:54:03;"I got you a first-class ticket out of Miami first thing in the morning."
01:54:03;01:54:08;"You're flying to L.A. to play Coachella."
01:54:08;01:54:11;"I bet you're pretty psyched to get out of Miami."""
01:54:11;01:54:13;">> He's like, ""Wait, what?"""
01:54:13;01:54:14;">> And he's like, ""Wait, what?"""
01:54:14;01:54:15;">> ""I'm in love."""
01:54:15;01:54:16;">> And he's like, ""Cancel Coachella."
01:54:16;01:54:18;"I'm going to be here for a while."""
01:54:18;01:54:23;"Hangs up the phone, him and his new girlfriend making out down South Beach."
01:54:23;01:54:30;"[ Music ]"
01:54:30;01:54:32;">> ""Time Crisis."" Thanks for listening."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"We'll be back in two weeks."
01:54:34;01:54:44;"[ Music ]"
