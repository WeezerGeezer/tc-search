00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, November."
00:04;00:08;"It's the first Time Crisis since the World Series, so we'll talk about the Dodgers, the"
00:08;00:13;"Astros and baseball, perhaps the most frickin' random sport in America."
00:13;00:20;"We'll also talk to John Gourley of Portugal Demand and Tim Heidecker about his new album."
00:20;00:23;"All this, plus the top five songs on iTunes."
00:23;00:28;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:35;00:42;"[applause]"
01:18;01:25;"So, as we talked about on the last episode, a lot of people get their news from Time Crisis,"
01:25;01:29;"which is slightly irresponsible given that we're a bi-weekly show."
01:29;01:30;"And heavily biased."
01:30;01:33;"And heavily biased, so that's fine."
01:33;01:35;"Some people don't have time to catch up."
01:35;01:37;"So the Astros won the World Series."
01:37;01:39;"They won it about five days ago."
01:39;01:41;"I'm announcing it now."
01:41;01:42;"We watched game seven."
01:42;01:44;"We watched game seven together."
01:44;01:47;"It was interesting for me because, you know, I'm not really a sports guy."
01:47;01:48;"Yep."
01:48;01:50;"I thought you were a bit of a baseball nut."
01:50;01:51;"I know baseball historically."
01:51;01:54;"I can't front, like I'm a Dodgers fan."
01:54;01:55;"I can name like four players."
01:55;01:57;"But you know like the lingo."
01:57;02:01;"As we were watching it, you were making calls like, ""Should have put in Kershaw earlier."""
02:01;02:02;"Yeah."
02:02;02:04;"Whereas I know very little about baseball."
02:04;02:09;"But I watched the last two games because I'm here in LA working with a lot of LA-based"
02:09;02:10;"people."
02:10;02:14;"In my heart, I made a split-second decision that I wanted the Astros to win."
02:14;02:15;"Respect."
02:15;02:18;"Sports is really boring if you're not rooting for one team, right?"
02:18;02:20;"Is that generally understood in the sports community?"
02:20;02:22;"No, I wouldn't say that, but we can move on."
02:22;02:23;"Really?"
02:23;02:25;"Yeah, I can watch a game and not have a vested interest."
02:25;02:30;"You'll just like watch the Milwaukee Bucks are taking on the Utah Jazz and you'll just"
02:30;02:32;"be like, ""High level of gameplay."""
02:32;02:33;"Tell you what."
02:33;02:34;"Yeah."
02:34;02:38;"If I'm in a hotel room and I flip on ESPN and it's like four minutes left in the fourth"
02:38;02:41;"quarter and it's tied, I'll watch the end of it."
02:41;02:42;"Sure."
02:42;02:43;"Really?"
02:43;02:44;"Sure."
02:44;02:45;"Even with just like two random ass teams?"
02:45;02:46;"Yeah."
02:46;02:47;"If it's like a good vibe, if it's tense."
02:47;02:48;"Yeah, I just don't relate to that."
02:48;02:49;"So, tell me about Houston."
02:49;02:51;"Okay, so Houston versus the Dodgers."
02:51;02:54;"So my friend makes me watch game six."
02:54;02:56;"He's a born and raised LA guy."
02:56;02:59;"I do some very minor research."
02:59;03:02;"So I know that Houston suffered a hurricane."
03:02;03:03;"Hurricane Harvey."
03:03;03:04;"Crazy flooding."
03:04;03:07;"So on some level already, I feel like they could use a W."
03:07;03:11;"Isn't that weird that there's been two Harveys in the news in the last like two months?"
03:11;03:12;"That crossed my mind for a second."
03:12;03:19;"I was like, they're both just like too horrible for even anybody to like talk about."
03:19;03:20;"Anyway, it's kind of a random name."
03:20;03:22;"So Houston got slammed with a hurricane."
03:22;03:23;"Houston got slammed."
03:23;03:24;"So of course they could kind of use it."
03:24;03:25;"They've never won."
03:25;03:27;"And then I saw that they never won."
03:27;03:28;"So come on."
03:28;03:30;"Now I'm really kind of rooting for them."
03:30;03:36;"And then also like I had this feeling and this doesn't cover everybody, but I felt like"
03:36;03:40;"proportionally the Dodgers probably have more fake fans."
03:40;03:41;"Okay."
03:41;03:42;"Cause it's a big trendy city."
03:42;03:43;"Yeah."
03:43;03:44;"Okay."
03:44;03:45;"Sure."
03:45;03:48;"And I know that's not fair because the Dodgers probably have millions of fans born and raised"
03:48;03:51;"like grew up in a few miles from the park and they want to see him win."
03:51;03:53;"So I was kind of like, I don't know."
03:53;03:56;"There's something in my gut told me that Houston seemed more like the underdog."
03:56;04:01;"And I feel like it'd be corny for me being just like a semi LA resident to just like"
04:01;04:02;"root for them."
04:02;04:04;"Just get all ride or die Dodgers."
04:04;04:05;"Yeah."
04:05;04:07;"I would feel corny about that."
04:07;04:08;"Sure."
04:08;04:09;"That makes sense."
04:09;04:13;"But as the game unfolded and we were researching the players, just almost everything I would"
04:13;04:14;"hear about the Houston players."
04:14;04:18;"I was like, that is a more interesting squad."
04:18;04:19;"Right?"
04:19;04:22;"So first I was researching Altuve."
04:22;04:26;"I found out that he was the shortest guy in MLB."
04:26;04:32;"We were reading about Bregman, a Jewish kid out of Albuquerque, which I thought was random."
04:32;04:34;"Shout out to Mark Maron."
04:34;04:36;"Another Jew from Albuquerque."
04:36;04:42;"And then you pointed out one of the best guys, at least his backstory is one of the best"
04:42;04:43;"was Evan Gattis."
04:43;04:48;"Well, first of all, he's the only player that doesn't use batting gloves and his bat is"
04:48;04:51;"just like a raw piece of wood, no pine tar, no varnish."
04:51;04:54;"He just has like a primal connection."
04:54;04:56;"And then, yeah, his whole backstory was interesting."
04:56;05:03;"Like really into new age kind of healing culture out of New Mexico had been drafted originally"
05:03;05:08;"fell into some troubles with substance abuse and then like spent three or four years kind"
05:08;05:12;"of like in the wilderness, like working at ski resorts, living in his van."
05:12;05:13;"Right."
05:13;05:14;"So this guy, he was a hot baseball."
05:14;05:17;"He was like, he was nationally known as a high school player."
05:17;05:21;"How long has this just become like a sports show now?"
05:21;05:26;"With two guys that have no business talking about sports."
05:26;05:28;"Bear with us, Crisis Crew."
05:28;05:29;"We're going to get through this."
05:29;05:34;"We're talking about Evan Gattis, nationally recognized, one of the hottest players on"
05:34;05:37;"the high school circuit, full ride to Texas A&M."
05:37;05:41;"And then his senior year of high school around then, his life kind of fell apart."
05:41;05:42;"His parents got divorced."
05:42;05:44;"He started abusing substance."
05:44;05:45;"So he never ended up at college."
05:45;05:47;"That's like in movies and stuff."
05:47;05:52;"You're this golden athlete, pride of your high school, about to go to a huge school."
05:52;05:53;"Everybody's excited."
05:53;05:57;"Think about how much pressure, like even random people from your town are putting on you."
05:57;05:58;"That's a big deal."
05:58;06:01;"And then we were reading about like what he got up to instead of going to college."
06:01;06:07;"I guess he briefly went to a junior college in Oklahoma, tried playing some baseball,"
06:07;06:08;"burned out and quit."
06:08;06:14;"So then he left school in baseball and became a parking valet in Dallas."
06:14;06:19;"And then he went to Boulder, Colorado, worked in a pizza parlor and was a ski lift operator."
06:19;06:22;"Probably running some sweet delivery in Boulder."
06:22;06:24;"That's a kind of vibe city."
06:24;06:25;"But he still wasn't happy."
06:25;06:27;"He still suffered serious mental health problems."
06:27;06:29;"Former MLB prospect."
06:29;06:35;"Then he and his brother moved to Dallas where they worked as janitors for Datamatics Global"
06:35;06:37;"Services, which sounds made up."
06:37;06:39;"Yeah, it's like a Mike Judge film."
06:39;06:46;"Then he met a spiritual advisor who advised him that he should follow her to Taos, New"
06:46;06:47;"Mexico."
06:47;06:49;"He worked at a ski resort there."
06:49;06:50;"I don't know."
06:50;06:53;"We don't have all the info about what happened, but I guess that was some type of spiritual"
06:53;06:54;"reawakening for him."
06:54;06:56;"He became refreshed."
06:56;06:57;"He wanted to go back to school."
06:57;07:01;"He went back to University of Texas, but not big old Texas A&M."
07:01;07:04;"He ended up at the University of Texas at Permian Basin."
07:04;07:07;"He got another shot to play ball and then he ended up back in the MLB."
07:07;07:12;"But this is like a dude who, you know, especially when people talk about athletes, it seems"
07:12;07:16;"like the age like 18 to 23 is like a real prime time to like get your together."
07:16;07:18;"Yeah, you got to do it."
07:18;07:21;"That's where you go from like being the best player at your school or in your state to"
07:21;07:23;"being like a world class athlete."
07:23;07:28;"So to imagine that this in this period he was suffering in so many ways to come back"
07:28;07:32;"at age 23, 24, whatever, start playing high school, college ball again."
07:32;07:33;"Yeah."
07:33;07:34;"Already that's crazy."
07:34;07:36;"And then from there he ended up being on the Braves."
07:36;07:38;"Then he ended up winning a World Series."
07:38;07:41;"So when you told me about Evan Gattis, then I was like, these guys got to win."
07:41;07:48;"It reminded me of the 2001 series when it was a month and a half after 9/11 and the"
07:48;07:53;"Yankees were playing the Arizona Diamondbacks and it went to game seven and Rivera blew"
07:53;07:54;"the save."
07:54;08:00;"And I remember thinking at the time, like, wow, there is no cosmic justice in sports"
08:00;08:03;"as it relates to geopolitical events."
08:03;08:07;"Because if that's a year that the Yankees should have won the series, that was it."
08:07;08:08;"Oh, one."
08:08;08:10;"The first post September 11th World Series."
08:10;08:12;"It's like, wow, okay."
08:12;08:13;"There is no God."
08:13;08:14;"That's what I learned that day."
08:14;08:19;"Well, maybe God is back because God rewarded God was rooting for Houston."
08:19;08:21;"How does rooting for the Astros?"
08:21;08:28;"I'm going to run that bait so it's not nice."
08:28;08:29;"For this life I cannot change."
08:29;08:30;"In the hills, deep off in the main."
08:30;08:31;"Eminem, sweet like candy cane."
08:31;08:32;"Drop the top, pop it, let it bang."
08:32;08:33;"For this life I cannot change."
08:33;08:34;"In the hills, deep off in the main."
08:34;08:35;"Eminem, sweet like candy cane."
08:35;08:36;"Drop the top, pop it, let it bang."
08:36;08:37;"For this life I cannot change."
08:37;08:38;"In the hills, deep off in the main."
08:38;08:39;"Eminem, sweet like candy cane."
08:39;08:40;"Drop the top, pop it, let it bang."
08:40;08:41;"For this life I cannot change."
08:41;08:42;"In the hills, deep off in the main."
08:42;08:43;"Eminem, sweet like candy cane."
08:43;08:44;"Drop the top, pop it, let it bang."
08:44;08:45;"For this life I cannot change."
08:45;08:46;"In the hills, deep off in the main."
08:46;08:51;"Eminem, sweet like candy cane."
08:51;08:56;"Drop the top, pop it, let it bang."
08:56;08:57;"Drop the top, lay high to see."
08:57;08:58;"Jump inside, jump straight to the lead."
08:58;08:59;"Take a sip, feel just how I be."
08:59;09:00;"On freeway, but know ain't nothing free."
09:00;09:01;"Been lost, been laced."
09:01;09:02;"Been busting bills, but still ain't nothing changed."
09:02;09:03;"You in the mob, soon as you rock the floor."
09:26;09:47;"You in the mob, soon as you rock the floor."
09:47;10:11;"You in the mob, soon as you rock the floor."
10:11;10:40;"You in the mob, soon as you rock the floor."
10:40;10:41;"You in the mob, soon as you rock the floor."
10:55;11:16;"You in the mob, soon as you rock the floor."
11:16;11:42;"You in the mob, soon as you rock the floor."
11:42;11:49;"You in the mob, soon as you rock the floor."
11:49;11:53;"You in the mob, soon as you rock the floor."
12:09;12:12;"You in the mob, soon as you rock the floor."
12:36;12:38;"You in the mob, soon as you rock the floor."
12:38;12:41;"You in the mob, soon as you rock the floor."
17:08;17:12;"I can only imagine that Ray playing on that opening day was quite the party."
17:12;17:17;"Okay, he sent in photos from the Whole Foods 1980 Grand Opening."
17:17;17:19;"We'll throw those up for everybody to see."
17:19;17:21;"Well, let's hear what his song ""Snake Farm"" sounds like."
17:33;17:36;"Well, the woman I love is named Ramona."
17:36;17:39;"She kind of looks like Tempest Storm."
17:39;17:42;"She can dance like a little Egypt."
17:42;17:46;"She works down at the snake farm, snake farm."
17:46;17:49;"It just sounds nasty, snake farm."
17:49;17:52;"Pretty much is snake farm."
17:52;17:55;"It's a reptile house, snake farm."
18:08;18:09;"One more paragraph here."
18:09;18:10;"We'll just read it over the music."
18:10;18:12;"1980, Austin, Texas."
18:12;18:16;"Summer's winding down, but something even more exciting is buzzing on the horizon."
18:16;18:18;"Organic in every sense of the word."
18:18;18:24;"Nineteen hippie Whole Foods employees and their friends celebrating graduating from the co-op to owning their own store."
18:24;18:27;"All fueled by the music of Ray Wiley and his prime."
18:27;18:31;"I like to imagine Willie might have been there and sat in for a few tunes."
18:31;18:35;"At the very least, he crushed a few cold Lone Stars from the audience."
18:35;18:36;"Take care, Matt."
18:36;18:37;"Great email."
18:37;18:39;"Hell of an email, Matt."
18:39;18:40;"So that's interesting, too."
18:40;18:45;"It's like this small group of people, the original employees, kind of sounds like they opened it together."
18:45;18:47;"I wonder if they all had equity in it."
18:47;18:52;"Are there 19 former Austin hippie billionaires?"
18:52;18:56;"Or alienated, pissed off people that got lawyered out?"
18:56;19:00;"We should make a movie like the Steve Jobs movie, except it's about Whole Foods."
19:00;19:01;"Oh, man."
19:01;19:03;"You know who should make that is Richard Linklater."
19:03;19:04;"Oh, yeah."
19:04;19:05;"Because he's from Austin."
19:05;19:06;"He's an Austin guy."
19:06;19:09;"But he also makes movies that, like, span time."
19:09;19:11;"Like, that is his true subject in a way."
19:11;19:15;"Like, there's the Before Sunrise trilogy and, of course, Boyhood."
19:15;19:18;"And Richard Linklater made Fast Food Nation."
19:18;19:19;"So up his alley."
19:19;19:22;"So he's tapped in with corporate America as a subject."
19:22;19:24;"Rick, if you're listening."
19:24;19:26;"Make the Whole Foods movie, man."
19:26;19:28;"All right, so, Jake, we got another good email."
19:28;19:30;"This one's about the '90s."
19:30;19:33;"And it's a different perspective on the 1990s."
19:33;19:38;"And actually, I've been thinking about it lately, especially as I've been in the studio, kind of finishing up this album."
19:38;19:39;"Yeah."
19:39;19:41;"I've been thinking about different palettes."
19:41;19:44;"And maybe it's just because of the age I'm at, but I've been thinking back to my youth,"
19:44;19:48;"and the '90s palette has interested me more than the '70s lately."
19:48;19:50;"Specifically which '90s palette?"
19:50;19:54;"I was just kind of thinking about all that music that wasn't, like, grunge or hip-hop,"
19:54;20:02;"but still was, like, on the radio all the time, like, Aerosmith, Hootie, Wallflowers, '90s Tom Petty."
20:02;20:03;"Sure."
20:03;20:06;"After the '80s, all those people were kind of, like, trying to shake off the '80s."
20:06;20:08;"That had, like, way more effects on the drums."
20:08;20:11;"And kind of doing the '90s version of the tasteful '70s palette."
20:11;20:13;"But it just was different."
20:13;20:14;"Yeah."
20:14;20:16;"Because you know, like, when they were producing those records, they were probably like,"
20:16;20:19;"""No, no, I don't want any of that '80s crap, man. I want it to sound like the '70s."""
20:19;20:21;"But it just ended up sounding like the '90s. That's what happens."
20:21;20:24;"But anyway, this email is from Rebecca Hertz."
20:24;20:27;"""Hi, Time Crisis crew. Care of Jake."
20:27;20:31;"Though I may not be in your typical demographic, I am an avid TC listener and fan."""
20:31;20:34;"The truth is we have no idea who our typical demographic is."
20:34;20:35;"Yeah, I have no idea."
20:35;20:36;"So you, who knows?"
20:36;20:38;"""I am writing today to reopen a discussion that I have heard you reference,"
20:38;20:41;"but I think the perspective could be widened a bit. The '90s."""
20:41;20:44;"Yeah, we've been pretty shallow on our '90s."
20:44;20:45;"It's mostly GBV talk."
20:45;20:47;"We talk about GBV."
20:47;20:49;"""I was a teenager in the '90s."""
20:49;20:50;"So if you're a teenager in the '90s, you're--"
20:50;20:52;"She's like my age, probably."
20:52;20:57;"I was partially a teenager in the '90s, but yes, maybe late '70s, early '80s birth."
20:57;20:58;"""I was a teenager in the '90s."
20:58;21:00;"That means I went to high school, graduated from high school, went to college,"
21:00;21:02;"and graduated from college all in that decade."""
21:02;21:04;"Boom. Class of '99 over here."
21:04;21:06;"Class of '99. You got in at the buzzer."
21:06;21:07;"You're a true '90--"
21:07;21:11;"Yeah, I've never thought about that in terms of eras, to put it that way."
21:11;21:12;"We've got to come up with a name for that."
21:12;21:15;"""When your entire eight years, from freshman year of high school"
21:15;21:18;"through senior year of college, is in one decade."""
21:18;21:20;"What do we call that? Golden eight?"
21:20;21:21;"Tight eight."
21:21;21:22;"Just a tight eight."
21:23;21:24;"'91 and '99, bud."
21:24;21:25;"You had a tight eight."
21:25;21:27;"So you're a true '90s guy."
21:27;21:28;"It's a great eight."
21:28;21:33;"My tight eight was from 1998 to 2006."
21:33;21:35;"Wait, you were a freshman in college and--"
21:35;21:37;"Okay, that makes sense. I'm seven years older than you."
21:37;21:38;"That's just funny to think about."
21:38;21:43;"You were a freshman in high school, and I'm entering my senior year of college."
21:43;21:45;"Imagine if we could have met then."
21:45;21:47;"We would have still been bros."
21:47;21:48;"Oh, yeah. For sure."
21:48;21:49;"We would have hit it off."
21:49;21:51;"Oh, yeah. But I would have been 21."
21:51;21:53;"You would have been 14."
21:53;21:54;"Yeah."
21:54;21:56;"You want a brew, man?"
21:56;21:58;"I think I had my first beer at 14."
21:58;22:00;"But anyway, I had a real freaking random--"
22:00;22:02;"But in a way, I've been blessed."
22:02;22:05;"I felt like my high school through college years"
22:05;22:08;"was such a freaking random, like, sh-- time in history."
22:08;22:11;"Just late '90s, American hubris."
22:11;22:14;"Yeah, you're going from Clinton to Bush. It's brutal."
22:14;22:17;"But even, like, the height of the Clinton years is kind of gross and f--ed up."
22:17;22:18;"Sure."
22:18;22:19;"And then into Bush."
22:19;22:21;"And so in some ways, there was kind of something cool about, like,"
22:21;22:24;"I began my working life as a teacher for a year."
22:24;22:25;"Vampire Weekend comes out."
22:25;22:29;"Obama becomes president, and then we get, like, a kind of a tight eight."
22:29;22:31;"Or a seemingly tight eight."
22:31;22:33;"At least we could, like, pat ourselves on the back."
22:33;22:35;"Let's just say it's a tight eight."
22:35;22:39;"I guess we're about to have some kids who had a full 2010s tight eight."
22:39;22:42;"I love that Rebecca helped us talk about this concept of the tight eight."
22:42;22:43;"So she had a tight eight."
22:43;22:46;"She went to high school, college, all that sh-- in the '90s."
22:46;22:48;"I went to high school in Los Angeles and college in Manhattan."
22:48;22:50;"My experience of the '90s is radically different"
22:50;22:52;"than the one I've heard you guys talk about on the show."
22:52;22:54;"It was not a period of calm politically."
22:54;22:58;"We could see the tidal wave of hyper-militarized corporate oppression approaching,"
22:58;23:00;"and we did everything we could to work against it."
23:00;23:02;"The music of the time reflected that."
23:02;23:06;"In fact, I look at the '90s as a time of deeply political music."
23:06;23:08;"And that's kind of what I was just saying about the Obama years."
23:08;23:14;"It's like, in retrospect, because we have such, like, brutally, openly harsh presidents,"
23:14;23:17;"we start to look back through rose-colored glasses at, like,"
23:17;23:20;"when Obama was president, when Clinton was president."
23:20;23:24;"And then, of course, as we start to realize, like, well, Clinton, they signed the crime bill."
23:24;23:26;"It's a very good point."
23:26;23:30;"So, anyway, here are some of Rebecca's examples of political music from the '90s."
23:30;23:33;"See Sonic Youth's 1992 album ""Dirty,"""
23:33;23:36;"a song swimsuit issue about sexual harassment in Hollywood,"
23:36;23:38;"great San Fernando Valley references, too,"
23:38;23:41;"and ""Youth Against Fascism,"" which is anti-Nazi,"
23:41;23:44;"and also contains the iconic line, ""I believe in Anita Hill."""
23:44;23:48;"Bikini Kill's seminal '90s anti-patriarchy albums,"
23:48;23:51;"songs such as ""Don't Need You"" and ""Suck My Left One,"""
23:51;23:55;"as well as ""Pretend We're Dead"" off of L7's 1992 album ""Bricks Are Heavy,"""
23:55;24:00;"about frustration with the silence of the left in the face of the Gulf War."
24:00;24:03;"Wasn't that L7's kind of, like, radio song, right?"
24:03;24:05;"I don't remember."
24:05;24:07;"Yeah, it's the number one song for them on--"
24:07;24:08;"Okay, this is good."
24:08;24:09;"This sounds tight."
24:09;24:11;"Yeah, no, L7's f---ing cool."
24:11;24:13;"I had this L7 album."
24:13;24:15;"I think I got it through Columbia House."
24:15;24:26;"♪"
24:26;24:27;"So poppy."
24:27;24:28;"I love it."
24:28;24:30;"Yeah, it's that kind of cool--"
24:30;24:31;"[imitates guitar]"
24:31;24:33;"Yeah, that grunge 30--"
24:33;24:34;"Almost like a Weezer."
24:34;24:36;"Yeah, this is before Weezer."
24:36;24:38;"That's a solid three years."
24:38;25:01;"♪"
25:01;25:02;"This is a great song."
25:02;25:05;"I did not know that it was about the silence of the left"
25:05;25:07;"in the face of the first Gulf War."
25:07;25:08;"♪"

26:10;26:13;"I guess sometimes you don't get all those things coalescing"
26:13;26:16;"into a giant movement at the same time"
26:16;26:21;"in quite the same picker-esque way that it happened in the '60s,"
26:21;26:24;"but that doesn't mean that it was like there were less people caring."
26:24;26:29;"Yeah, in the '60s, the major kind of divisive social issues"
26:29;26:32;"were larger, basically, than they were in the '90s."
26:32;26:35;"Or not even larger, but more straightforward."
26:35;26:36;"Right."
26:36;26:37;"And that is a tough one."
26:37;26:40;"Yeah, easier to point your finger at."
26:40;26:42;"Yeah, because you could say to somebody something like,"
26:42;26:45;"in the '60s, I guess, if you were arguing with a white supremacist"
26:45;26:49;"and you were saying black people were treated terribly in this country,"
26:49;26:51;"you'd be like, ""Give me one example,"" and you could be like,"
26:51;26:54;"""The Jim Crow laws of the South,"" whereas today,"
26:54;26:57;"people actually use that to try to pretend that nothing's the matter."

26:59;27:01;"There's no segregated waterfronts."""

27:16;27:19;"Certainly not all people, but for some people to understand."
27:19;27:21;"I mean, right now is a very political time."
27:21;27:23;"There's plenty of people out there protesting."
27:23;27:25;"There's people making political music."
27:25;27:27;"It is now like the '60s, Jake."
27:27;27:32;"Are there people making political music that are huge superstars?"
27:32;27:36;"Yeah, people would say that Beyoncé was very political on her last album."
27:36;27:39;"Katy Perry was vaguely political on her last album."
27:39;27:43;"As we talked about, Eminem went on BET and dropped--"
27:43;27:46;"literally threatened to drop a very hot coffee pot on the president."
27:46;27:51;"So I know it's funny, but on a very basic level,"
27:51;27:55;"if we take off our music critic glasses for a second,"
27:55;27:59;"is Eminem getting up there and saying, ""That's an awfully hot coffee pot""?"

29:10;29:13;"No, it's easy to idealize the '60s protest music."
29:13;29:15;"That's for sure."
29:15;29:18;"I think it's good to take all protest music with a grain of salt"
29:18;29:20;"and not pit it against each other and say,"
29:20;29:24;"""60s protest music is, like, corny if you look at it through a certain lens."
29:24;29:29;"'90s protest music is a little impressionistic in a way."""
29:29;29:31;"It's a generation removed, yeah."
29:31;29:33;"And even--because you can have a sense of irony"
29:33;29:35;"and still be very passionate about political issues,"
29:35;29:40;"but it's all art, and, you know, art can just sit there"
29:40;29:42;"and be a reflection of the moment."
29:42;29:43;"And that's cool."
29:43;29:45;"I think art should be a reflection of the moment,"
29:45;29:50;"but I guess then you still got to vote, still got to read books,"
29:50;29:53;"got to do all, like, the kind of boring stuff"
29:53;29:55;"to affect political change--protest."
29:55;29:58;"It's interesting how Nirvana really wasn't political,"
29:58;30:00;"because they--yeah, like, as Rebecca says,"
30:00;30:04;"I mean, they definitely were influenced by, like, all those bands--"
30:04;30:10;"Sonic Youth, L7, all of the Kill Rockstars bands,"
30:10;30:12;"all the K-Records bands."
30:12;30:16;"But Kurt Cobain's songs were, like, weirdly kind of personal."
30:16;30:19;"Well, if you watch the documentary and you read interviews about him,"
30:19;30:22;"you realize that he had very strong feelings about gender equality."
30:22;30:23;"Absolutely."
30:23;30:26;"He hated the patriarchy, he hated the white male patriarchy."
30:26;30:30;"He felt--even him as a white male, he felt victimized by it."
30:30;30:33;"And the truth is, white males are victimized, you know, in their own way."
30:33;30:34;"That's a winning argument."
30:34;30:38;"Yeah. No, but that's an argument that I've heard extremely woke people make."
30:38;30:40;"I'm not trying to say that they're victimized"
30:40;30:43;"in the sense that they got it just as bad as everybody else."
30:43;30:45;"I'm saying this is, like, a very old idea"
30:45;30:47;"that in any kind of oppressive system,"
30:47;30:52;"the oppressor is also being sucked into something horrible."
30:52;30:54;"You know, that's some [bleep] that, like, Nelson Mandela would say."
30:54;30:55;"Okay."
30:55;30:58;"Like, even him as a black man in apartheid South Africa"
30:58;31:00;"being treated like a subhuman."
31:00;31:03;"Even he, when he would talk about his prison guards,"
31:03;31:06;"when he's in prison forever, would talk about the way in which they were--"
31:06;31:08;"maybe ""victim"" is not the right word,"
31:08;31:11;"but that their lives were sucked into this oppressive system, too."
31:11;31:13;"He had sympathy for them?"
31:13;31:15;"Yeah, I think you could call it a type of sympathy."
31:15;31:17;"But anyway, my point is that Kurt Cobain,"
31:17;31:20;"it seemed like he felt victimized by growing up in a macho--"
31:20;31:23;"because he would describe his hometown as being full of macho rednecks."
31:23;31:26;"And because even though he was a white male, he wasn't that."
31:26;31:29;"So people were mean to him, made him feel like [bleep]"
31:29;31:30;"and abused him, whatever."
31:30;31:32;"So the more you know about Kurt Cobain,"
31:32;31:35;"the more you know that he's definitely somebody who had political views."
31:35;31:39;"To pull that out of the music, because his lyrics are so impressionistic,"
31:39;31:41;"is not exactly an easy task."
31:41;31:43;"But the music and the lyrics are still great."
31:43;31:46;"Won't you believe it, it's just my luck"
31:55;31:59;"No reason"
31:59;32:02;"No reason"
32:03;32:05;"No reason"
32:05;32:13;"Won't you believe it, it's just my luck"
32:13;32:16;"Won't you believe it, it's just my luck"
32:22;32:26;"No reason"
32:30;32:32;"No reason"
32:34;32:37;"[guitar solo]"
33:04;33:07;"You're an asshole again"
33:22;33:24;"You're an asshole again"
33:24;33:28;"You're an asshole again"
33:28;33:31;"No reason"
33:32;33:34;"No reason"
33:34;33:37;"No reason"
33:43;33:47;"No reason"
33:47;33:49;"No reason"
33:49;33:52;"Okay, so Jake, you weren't familiar with them already,"
33:52;33:57;"but we were listening to a song that's been racing up the charts the past few months,"
33:57;33:59;"""Feel It Still"" by Portugal the Man."
33:59;34:04;"And when we first heard it, you correctly pointed out that there was kind of a riff"
34:04;34:10;"from ""Please Mr. Postman,"" and then we looked them up and they're from Wasilla, Alaska."
34:10;34:13;"So anyway, we got John Gourley, the lead singer of Portugal the Man, calling in."
34:13;34:14;"Love it."
34:14;34:17;"He's down to talk about whatever, answer our questions about ""Feel It Still,"""
34:17;34:19;"answer our questions about Alaska."
34:19;34:20;"Very psyched about this one."
34:20;34:21;"Let's do it."
34:21;34:25;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
34:25;34:28;"[phone ringing]"
34:28;34:29;"Hello?"
34:29;34:31;"Hey John, what's up? Welcome to Time Crisis."
34:31;34:33;"You're on with me, Ezra, and Jake."
34:33;34:34;"What up?"
34:35;34:37;"How are you doing? Where are you calling from, John?"
34:37;34:39;"I'm in Portland, Oregon right now."
34:39;34:43;"We have a little break from tour, hanging out with my daughter."
34:43;34:44;"How old?"
34:44;34:45;"Six years old."
34:45;34:48;"So you're a Portland-based musician,"
34:48;34:53;"but one thing that we definitely want to talk about with you is your Alaskan heritage."
34:53;34:59;"So we read that your father moved to Alaska, but he went to Woodstock."
34:59;35:03;"So does that mean he was like a continental U.S. hippie"
35:03;35:07;"who decided to get out of Dodge and see what was popping in Alaska?"
35:07;35:09;"What's the story? How did your family end up in Alaska?"
35:09;35:15;"Yeah, so my dad is--he is a hippie in kind of like the loose sense of it."
35:15;35:19;"He cares about people, cares about the environment, things like that."
35:19;35:21;"He's not a pacifist in any way."
35:21;35:26;"He's one of the hardest-working people I know, and he's worked for everything."
35:26;35:28;"He's the type of guy that will get in a fist fight."
35:28;35:30;"So he's like a tough hippie."
35:30;35:32;"Yeah, he's like a tough hippie."
35:32;35:38;"In his circle of friends, his best friend's dad actually is the one that inspired him and his group"
35:38;35:42;"to move from Morrisville, New York, up to Alaska."
35:42;35:44;"So he moved with a whole posse?"
35:44;35:49;"Yeah, so my dad and a group of his friends--his friend's dad is Robert Durer,"
35:49;35:51;"who wrote ""The Iceman Cometh."""
35:51;35:52;"Oh, wow."
35:52;35:54;"There must have been something in the air at that time."
35:54;35:57;"Alaska is known as the last frontier."
35:57;36:01;"My mom and dad are both from the same town, Morrisville, New York,"
36:01;36:06;"and moved up there kind of around the same time, didn't know each other in Morrisville,"
36:06;36:09;"but met each other in Wasilla, Alaska."
36:09;36:13;"There's just a lot of people on that Morrisville to Wasilla circuit?"
36:13;36:15;"That's a coincidence?"
36:15;36:19;"I think it's all around that circle of friends and that group."
36:19;36:21;"But what's the story about him going to Woodstock?"
36:21;36:24;"Was this right after Woodstock they decided to make the move?"
36:24;36:27;"Well, Woodstock happened--my dad graduated in '69."
36:27;36:29;"From high school?"
36:29;36:30;"Yeah."
36:30;36:34;"You know, if I'm being honest, I never really got a lot of the stories about Woodstock."
36:34;36:38;"I never really got a lot of the things that's happened to my dad."
36:38;36:42;"I've gotten these little bits and pieces as we've gone along."
36:42;36:46;"I mean, my gift to him 10 years ago was a tape recorder,"
36:46;36:50;"so I have all of his stories stored on his tape recorder somewhere"
36:50;36:52;"that he gave me at some point."
36:52;36:55;"But I've gotten little bits and pieces along the way."
36:55;36:57;"The newest Portugal the Man album is called Woodstock."
36:57;37:01;"Yeah, yeah, which is loosely inspired by that."
37:01;37:03;"Woodstock '94, right?"
37:03;37:06;"My dad went to Woodstock '94."
37:06;37:08;"There is something interesting to me."
37:08;37:10;"Obviously, I don't know your dad, but it's like--"
37:10;37:15;"that's kind of intense that you would be--1969, you just graduated high school."
37:15;37:17;"You already live in upstate New York,"
37:17;37:24;"and you happen to witness this iconic, epic, gigantic concert of hippies."
37:24;37:28;"You couldn't--in 1969, in terms of youth culture,"
37:28;37:31;"you couldn't possibly have been more in the mix than being at Woodstock."
37:31;37:32;"It's ground zero."
37:32;37:39;"So one year your dad is looking around at America's finest hippies together."
37:39;37:42;"Hendricks just ripping into the national anthem."
37:42;37:45;"One year later, he's in Wasilla, Alaska."
37:45;37:48;"That's a hell of a year, a year to year."
37:48;37:50;"Yeah, I'd say so."
37:50;37:53;"The way they did it, when they went up to Alaska,"
37:53;37:55;"my dad and his group of friends, they all went out--"
37:55;37:59;"actually, to Taquita and the Chase Mountain Range,"
37:59;38:01;"and they all went their separate ways."
38:01;38:04;"It was at this time where you could stake a claim on land."
38:04;38:05;"Really?"
38:05;38:07;"These were 19-year-old dudes just like--"
38:07;38:09;"Just homesteading in 1970?"
38:09;38:10;"That's amazing."
38:10;38:14;"My dad didn't even have the $50 or whatever it was to pay for the deed"
38:14;38:17;"or the title on the land, so they were just living out--"
38:17;38:19;"kind of, I mean, really in the middle of nowhere."
38:19;38:23;"They're in this place that nobody really knows a lot about at the time"
38:23;38:25;"and just living off the land."
38:25;38:27;"They did this for three years."
38:27;38:29;"I'm pretty sure that was the whole plan."
38:29;38:31;"They all went out to the mountains, went their separate ways,"
38:31;38:33;"and they lived off the land for three years,"
38:33;38:36;"and then came back to town and all met up."
38:36;38:37;"That's wild."
38:37;38:39;"Okay, so then flash forward to your birth."
38:39;38:41;"So you're growing up in Wasilla, Alaska."
38:41;38:44;"For people like us, never been to Alaska before,"
38:44;38:47;"obviously Wasilla in the past 10 years,"
38:47;38:49;"most people associate it with Sarah Palin."
38:49;38:51;"What's the vibe of Wasilla?"
38:51;38:54;"Is it, like, semi-rural? How big is the town?"
38:54;38:56;"Is there a Best Buy there?"
38:56;39:01;"Well, I think now we have Target, we have all that big city stuff."
39:01;39:03;"Growing up, we didn't really have a lot."
39:03;39:07;"I think there were 5,000 people in Wasilla when we were growing up there."
39:07;39:10;"And when you say 5,000 people in Wasilla,"
39:10;39:15;"you're counting anywhere from 20 to 50 miles around Wasilla."
39:15;39:16;"The hinterlands."
39:16;39:19;"Yeah, they kind of take everybody in there."
39:19;39:21;"It was a pretty small place."
39:21;39:24;"I mean, we grew up hanging out at the Cars parking lot,"
39:24;39:26;"which is like our grocery store."
39:26;39:27;"Whoa."
39:27;39:29;"When I was a kid, I'd sometimes hang out in the 7-Eleven parking lot,"
39:29;39:32;"but even that's kind of a different vibe."
39:32;39:36;"So was there, like, for instance, a record store anywhere near you?"
39:36;39:38;"We did have a record store."
39:38;39:42;"So even when I grew up in Wasilla, I was 15, 20 miles away."
39:42;39:44;"I grew up in a really amazing place."
39:44;39:46;"I got to be straight about that."
39:46;39:48;"When you grow up in these spots,"
39:48;39:52;"I never thought about how great it was that I grew up on the Cook Inlet."
39:52;39:55;"My neighbors were five miles away,"
39:55;39:56;"and we grew up on the Cook Inlet,"
39:56;40:02;"which is this kind of deep, gray, silty body of water behind our house."
40:02;40:05;"And we'd have these--like, every year, we'd have beluga whales"
40:05;40:07;"swimming up behind my house."
40:07;40:08;"That's unreal."
40:08;40:11;"So you're just a kid looking out the window, and you see some belugas."
40:11;40:14;"Yeah, and I don't give a [bleep] at all,"
40:14;40:16;"because I've seen it a million times."
40:16;40:18;"Like, every year, I'd see the same beluga whales coming up."
40:18;40:21;"You wouldn't even look up from your Game Boy?"
40:21;40:25;"Yeah, I'd be hanging out, like, hanging out with friends, playing in the woods,"
40:25;40:28;"and my friends would see the whales coming up the water with the tide."
40:28;40:31;"And it's--I mean, it's just this deep, gray, silt water"
40:31;40:34;"with these white whales kind of rolling around,"
40:34;40:37;"and they would flip out, and I'd say, ""Come on, man."
40:37;40:39;"Yeah, there's [bleep] whales. They're back there all the time."
40:39;40:42;"Get your stick. Let's go play guns in the woods."""
40:42;40:44;"For you, that was like seeing a pigeon."
40:44;40:46;"Yeah, it was just like--I'd see that [bleep] all the time."
40:46;40:48;"Were there grizzly bears around?"
40:48;40:50;"Oh, yeah, we had bears."
40:50;40:53;"We had black bears, grizzly bears."
40:53;40:56;"So was that a concern when, like, playing in the woods as a kid,"
40:56;40:59;"like, were your parents like, ""Well, there's grizzlies around."
40:59;41:04;"Don't get eaten by a grizzly,"" or if you see a grizzly, ""Play dead,"" or what?"
41:04;41:07;"Well, I know this is controversial, but I grew up in Alaska."
41:07;41:11;"I was carrying guns at, like, 17 years old."
41:11;41:13;"Carrying guns with me."
41:13;41:16;"And looking back on it now, it's absolutely ridiculous."
41:16;41:20;"This little kid is going to shoot at a bear if he comes at him."
41:20;41:22;"Were the guns for the bears, though?"
41:22;41:25;"Yeah, the guns were for the bear for protection."
41:25;41:27;"I mean, literally, like, there's moose out there."
41:27;41:28;"There's bears."
41:28;41:32;"Moose are just so much crazier than anybody ever thinks."
41:32;41:37;"We see stories in the paper every year about some tourist got the [bleep]"
41:37;41:40;"kicked out of him by a moose trying to go and edit."
41:40;41:45;"Because they look so dopey, but they're just this hyper-aggressive giant horse."
41:45;41:47;"I mean, they'll kick you."
41:47;41:48;"They'll stomp you."
41:48;41:49;"No, no, that's a good point."
41:49;41:54;"People think of moose as being, like, a cute goofball animal."
41:54;41:56;"Like, they call that ice cream moose tracks."
41:56;42:00;"Like, moose--people almost talk about moose like they're rabbits or something."
42:00;42:05;"Whereas the truth is, moose is like the lion of the ecosystem in some places."
42:05;42:09;"Every one of us has been chased by a moose at one point."
42:09;42:12;"That's like a Wasilla rite of passage is getting chased by a moose?"
42:12;42:14;"Yeah, you've been chased by a moose."
42:14;42:19;"Obviously, Wasilla is a place full of natural beauty, majestic creatures."
42:19;42:20;"What's, like, the vibe?"
42:20;42:23;"Like, at your school, as somebody who was interested in--"
42:23;42:26;"or had at least a burgeoning interest in, like, music"
42:26;42:30;"and maybe a left-of-center taste in music, were you, like, a weirdo?"
42:30;42:33;"Or, like, it's just a small town, everybody knows each other, it's pretty chill?"
42:33;42:35;"Everybody knew each other."
42:35;42:36;"It's like any other small town."
42:36;42:38;"I mean, you tour quite a bit as well."
42:38;42:41;"Whenever you hit the small towns, like middle America,"
42:41;42:43;"it always reminds me of Alaska."
42:43;42:46;"It's just--yeah, there's the freaks, there's the jocks,"
42:46;42:49;"there's, you know, the stoners and the skaters,"
42:49;42:52;"and I was always obsessed with that stuff."
42:52;42:56;"Kind of a lot of the music I found in high school was through, like, Welcome to Hell."
42:56;43:01;"It was Toy Machine and Ed Templeton, and I was in that circle, like the skater kid."
43:01;43:05;"I was my group of friends, but where I lived, I didn't have any pavement."
43:05;43:07;"I couldn't skateboard."
43:07;43:08;"Like, I would just watch these movies."
43:08;43:10;"Did you own a skateboard?"
43:10;43:11;"No."
43:11;43:12;"I had no use for one."
43:12;43:14;"I would go snowboarding."
43:14;43:15;"No, I'm with you."
43:15;43:19;"Like, I love the culture of skate movies."
43:19;43:23;"I've never skateboarded in my life, but yeah, I was kind of enjoyed watching that."
43:23;43:24;"The music's great."
43:24;43:26;"It's like seeing the dudes, like, goof off."
43:26;43:28;"You learn a lot from them, especially when you're a kid."
43:28;43:30;"Yeah, that's what I was really obsessed with."
43:30;43:34;"And it was Ed Templeton in particular, was his style, his art,"
43:34;43:38;"everything around Toy Machine was really exciting to me."
43:38;43:42;"I loved his high waters and his kind of nerdy look that he had."
43:42;43:48;"That was all really cool, but it was just everything that we saw had to be shipped in."
43:48;43:49;"Right."
43:49;43:51;"You couldn't walk down the street and find that."
43:51;43:54;"So a lot of the music that we came across was through our parents,"
43:54;43:57;"and that's where Woodstock comes into play."
43:57;44:02;"It was my dad showing me that VHS copy of Woodstock,"
44:02;44:08;"seeing Richie Haven just opening up Woodstock, like, tearing his guitar in half."
44:08;44:12;"Like, you feel like you could see, like, blood coming out of his throat."
44:12;44:19;"He's, like, tearing something and delivering this just passionate rendition of Motherless Child."
44:19;44:21;"There was something about that."
44:21;44:23;"Seeing that is what got me excited about music,"
44:23;44:30;"was seeing that, seeing Joe Cocker with his all-male band doing the female backup vocals."
44:30;44:33;"That's when I realized that maybe I can sing."
44:33;44:35;"Maybe I can do this, because I always had a higher voice."
44:35;44:37;"I always felt really self-conscious about singing,"
44:37;44:39;"and I was seeing people, like, sing falsetto"
44:39;44:44;"and also backing up this complete psychopath in Joe Cocker."
44:44;44:51;"What would you do if I sat at a tomb?"
44:51;44:57;"Would you stand up and walk out on me?"
44:57;45:04;"Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song."
45:04;45:09;"I will try not to sing out of key."
45:09;45:14;"Oh baby, how did I, how did I,"
45:14;45:20;"oh, I made it my way."
45:20;45:27;"Oh baby, how did I, how did I,"
45:27;45:32;"I'm gonna make it my way."
45:32;45:36;"Well, so let's fast forward to current day,"
45:36;45:39;"because, you know, on this show we always do the top five,"
45:39;45:43;"and so your song ""Feel It Still"" has been in the top five quite a few times now."
45:43;45:47;"I think it's a great song, and also I've been kind of pointing out to people,"
45:47;45:50;"because not everybody always thinks about this,"
45:50;45:53;"that to actually have, like, a band,"
45:53;45:55;"I don't know how you guys define yourself, but, like, you know,"
45:55;45:58;"left of center, alternative, whatever,"
45:58;46:02;"rarely in these days, not since the 90s,"
46:02;46:04;"ever crack, like, the top ten,"
46:04;46:06;"ever have what anybody would call, like, a hit song."
46:06;46:09;"I'm kind of curious, so when you started working on this song,"
46:09;46:13;"did you have a sense that you wanted ""Portugal the Man"""
46:13;46:15;"to have, quote unquote, a hit,"
46:15;46:18;"and that just seemed so crazy you couldn't even think about it?"
46:18;46:19;"How has this been?"
46:19;46:22;"You probably approach music the same way we do,"
46:22;46:25;"which is I just want to write the best song I can,"
46:25;46:28;"and we set out to do that."
46:28;46:32;"I mean, we worked with Mike D, who, by the way, speaks very highly of you."
46:32;46:34;"Oh, appreciate that. Love Mike."
46:34;46:36;"He's the f***ing best, man."
46:36;46:41;"And working with him and Brian Danger Mouse, John Hill,"
46:41;46:43;"all of these people have always just pushed me"
46:43;46:45;"to try something more and do something better,"
46:45;46:48;"and we wanted to write that song, for sure,"
46:48;46:50;"but you can't predict that stuff."
46:50;46:53;"Like, there's no way I could have written that song"
46:53;46:55;"if I sat down and said, ""You know what?"
46:55;46:57;"I'm going to write a number one song."
46:57;46:59;"I'm going to write a top five."""
46:59;47:01;"You just can't do it."
47:01;47:03;"I want to be in the top five on Time Crisis."
47:03;47:07;"Every musician's dream is to get there."
47:07;47:09;"Yeah, get me a break. Can I get on ""Esmer's Show""?"
47:09;47:12;"I also think a lot about, like, with hit songs,"
47:12;47:15;"it's like a classic hindsight is 20/20 thing."
47:15;47:18;"Like, somebody could listen to your song ""Feel It Still Now"""
47:18;47:21;"and be like, ""Well, yeah, obviously that's a hit."
47:21;47:24;"It has all the hallmarks of a hit song, you know,"
47:24;47:26;"like the number of elements happening and the way the hook works,"
47:26;47:28;"and it reminds me of this and that."""
47:28;47:31;"But go back three years ago and play it for somebody and say, like,"
47:31;47:34;"""You think this is going to be top five"
47:34;47:37;"in between Chainsmokers songs in a few years?"""
47:37;47:39;"You wouldn't think that."
47:39;47:41;"You don't sit down to write a song like that,"
47:41;47:43;"and sometimes you're surprised which songs go the furthest."
47:43;47:45;"So the first time we heard it,"
47:45;47:48;"Jake kind of recognized the ""Please, Mr. Postman"" melody,"
47:48;47:51;"and we saw that the people who wrote that song have publishing on it."
47:51;47:53;"So we're kind of curious about how that came about,"
47:53;47:56;"because on this show we talk a lot about how, you know,"
47:56;47:59;"sometimes somebody goes out of their way to reference a song,"
47:59;48:02;"and more often than not these days, a song is written,"
48:02;48:05;"and somebody says, ""That kind of reminds me of this other song,"""
48:05;48:07;"and then you have a lawsuit."
48:07;48:10;"So was this a preemptive thing, or when you start writing,"
48:10;48:13;"would it be cool to kind of reference ""Please, Mr. Postman"""
48:13;48:15;"in a different context? Like, what's the story with it?"
48:15;48:18;"We set out to do that. I mean, that was the whole thing."
48:18;48:21;"Like, when I sat down and started working on the song,"
48:21;48:23;"it really did come out of nowhere."
48:23;48:27;"We were mixing ""Livin' the Moment"" with John Hill in one room,"
48:27;48:30;"and I kind of stepped into a side room,"
48:30;48:32;"and Asa Tacone from Electric Guest--"
48:32;48:34;"Yeah, I did not know Asa there."
48:34;48:36;"He's a rad dude, and as you know,"
48:36;48:39;"it gets always weird if an outside--another artist"
48:39;48:42;"steps in on your songwriting."
48:42;48:44;"But I just kind of stepped in the side room,"
48:44;48:47;"and he was working on his own thing in one corner,"
48:47;48:50;"and I just picked up this 1960s Hoffner"
48:50;48:52;"and started playing that bass line."
48:52;48:56;"And just immediately Asa kind of tilted his headphones back"
48:56;48:59;"and looked over and said, ""Yo, Jay, you mind if I record that real quick?"""
48:59;49:02;"And I was kind of caught off guard by it, to be honest."
49:02;49:06;"Like, it's just not a normal thing for artists to be so open"
49:06;49:08;"and just to kind of jump on it like that."
49:08;49:11;"And I let him record it, and he asked if I had a bridge."
49:11;49:14;"I threw down the bass just for a bridge real quick."
49:14;49:18;"And everything just started happening really quickly."
49:18;49:23;"I had written that lyric with Mike, actually, 5 years ago."
49:23;49:25;"I'd been thinking about this lyric forever,"
49:25;49:27;"and I'd used it a million times."
49:27;49:30;"And there was just something about the thump of the bass."
49:30;49:33;"It reminded me of those drives to town to get groceries."
49:33;49:36;"I mean, we'd have, like, 2-hour drives to go get groceries sometimes."
49:36;49:39;"- Wow. - Just depending on where we lived."
49:39;49:42;"And we would sing along with Mr. Postman."
49:42;49:44;"And we'd sing along with Motown and The Beatles."
49:44;49:48;"And there was just something about it that was so immediate to me."
49:48;49:51;"And I sang that lyric, ""I'm a rebel just for kicks,"""
49:51;49:54;"and then it just led me to 1966."
49:54;49:57;"And everything just kind of snowballed from there."
49:57;49:59;"I mean, every lyric led to the next."
49:59;50:04;"""Let me kick it like it's 1986"" was a Beastie Boys reference."
50:04;50:06;"- I mean, I was ""kick it."" - Right."
50:06;50:10;"The funniest thing about this is I said it to everybody when I sent it in."
50:10;50:13;"I said, ""Hey, just so you know, this is Mr. Postman."""
50:13;50:16;"And everybody came back saying, ""No, it's not. You're cool."""
50:16;50:17;"I can totally picture that."
50:17;50:18;"Because that's funny, too."
50:18;50:21;"Sometimes when you're the artist, you're trying to be extra sensitive"
50:21;50:24;"to put yourself in the shoes of another songwriter."
50:24;50:27;"You really want them to know that you would never intentionally rip them off."
50:27;50:30;"And then you have other people being like, ""Wait, you're crazy."
50:30;50:32;"""What, are you going to give up some publishing?"
50:32;50:35;"""No, get it? No, no, no. Don't do it."""
50:35;50:37;"That's so classic."
50:37;50:40;"No, it's funny. It was like two weeks before the song came out."
50:40;50:41;"We actually got hit."
50:41;50:43;"The musicologist called me up and said,"
50:43;50:49;"""Okay, he's walking me through exactly how this is exactly Mr. Postman."""
50:49;50:51;"The pacing, the time, everything about it."
50:51;50:54;"""This is Mr. Postman. He's playing full back to me."""
50:54;50:56;"And he gets done, and I go, ""Yeah, I know."""
50:56;50:58;"That was intentional."
50:58;51:02;"So you have that scramble to try and clear it before it comes out."
51:02;51:04;"Obviously they cleared it, and everything was cool."
51:04;51:08;"But the thing that I loved about it was--it's that thing."
51:08;51:12;"It's that I get to sing this song for the rest of my life"
51:12;51:17;"that reminds me of those drives singing Mr. Postman with my family."
51:17;51:21;"There's these really great memories of us just singing along in the car"
51:21;51:25;"and these long trips to go see my dad when he's running the Yukon Quest."
51:25;51:29;"It's just cool to share that stuff with other generations."
51:29;51:32;"It's something we've talked about it a million times."
51:32;51:36;"It's Keith Seeger and Woody Guthrie traveling across the country"
51:36;51:41;"writing folk songs and learning a new folk song in Missoula"
51:41;51:45;"and taking it to Idaho Falls and writing a new verse along the way."
51:45;51:47;"It becomes their song."
51:47;51:49;"It becomes something a little bit different along the way."
51:49;51:53;"I always think, to me, that I've done a lot of work"
51:53;51:58;"with references, other songs, inspiration, kind of do my own thing with it."
51:58;52:00;"But of course it's indebted to the other song."
52:00;52:05;"I've done a lot of songs where another artist--you kind of had to clear a sample, so to speak."
52:05;52:09;"And the truth is that sometimes people think that that's kind of"
52:09;52:13;"some new-fangled hip-hop way of doing things, that it's like an aberration."
52:13;52:15;"It used to be people just sat down and wrote songs."
52:15;52:19;"No, the vast majority of human history has been people using melodies"
52:19;52:21;"as a way to remember stuff."
52:21;52:25;"If you think about it, Homer, the Iliad, actually had a melody."
52:25;52:27;"Or the Bible has a melody."
52:27;52:30;"You know, like the Old Testament, the Bible, you could sing the whole thing."
52:30;52:34;"Because our brains work really well to use melodies to do your own thing with"
52:34;52:39;"and to spin and to--every folk song, like you said, is a million versions of it."
52:39;52:41;"So yeah, I love stories like that."
52:41;52:45;"I think it's super cool that there's a part of something from your old memory"
52:45;52:47;"that's part of a new song."
52:47;52:50;"And look, millions of people are hearing this song now."
52:50;52:54;"Maybe 80% to 90% of them just like the song."
52:54;52:56;"But there's going to be a sizable percentage of people who are like,"
52:56;52:59;"""Oh, I wonder, like, I see these other names in the songwriting credits."
52:59;53:00;"Who's that?"""
53:00;53:03;"Like, that's how I was when I was a kid. I learned a lot that way."
53:03;53:05;"No, man, that's what's great about music."
53:05;53:07;"And I think that's what music should be."
53:07;53:13;"I mean, this was hip-hop as well, where hip-hop comes from just sampling records."
53:13;53:19;"And I love that idea of creating something new with something that is so familiar to you"
53:19;53:21;"and something that means so much to you."
53:21;53:23;"Some people are just sampling records that they love,"
53:23;53:26;"and they get to rap over it and write a new chorus."
53:26;53:29;"And that should be how we share music."
53:29;53:32;"Totally. And one last thing that I'll say is also, like,"
53:32;53:35;"you made something that's really connecting with a lot of people"
53:35;53:37;"that's deeply original too."
53:37;53:40;"And you know, you put 1,000 people in a room with ""Please Mr. Postman,"""
53:40;53:42;"they're not all going to come out with your song."
53:42;53:45;"They're not all going to write a Time Crisis Top 5 song."
53:45;53:49;"So, you know, as much as obviously the song's indebted to that,"
53:49;53:51;"you did your thing with it, and I think that's great."
53:51;53:53;"Well, John, we've got to wrap up."
53:53;53:54;"Thanks so much for calling in, man."
53:54;53:56;"I hope we cross paths in person in the future,"
53:56;54:01;"and thanks for talking to us, painting that beautiful portrait of your youth up in Alaska."
54:01;54:02;"There you go."
54:02;54:04;"All right, talk to you soon, man. Have a good rest of your tour."
54:04;54:05;"Thanks, buddy."
54:05;54:06;"All right, peace."
56:49;56:50;"Thanks for having me."
56:50;56:51;"Our pleasure."
56:51;56:52;"It's an honor to be here."
56:52;56:53;"You're also a radio host in a way."
56:53;57:01;"Office Hours, it's a Facebook live stream call-in show where people can call into my Skype."
57:01;57:08;"It's a little bit of a ripoff, I guess, of Tom Sharpling's show or the Howard Stern show or any other radio show."
57:08;57:12;"And then that gets turned into a podcast after I do the live stream."
57:12;57:15;"I want to say one thing before we get in, because we were talking about it."
57:15;57:20;"Sometimes you get people who call in the show and they just say, ""Oh, I'm just a big fan."""
57:20;57:22;"And it kind of ruins the flow of the show, but I'm a big fan."
57:22;57:27;"And I was thinking about this because I've always been very interested in the year 2004."
57:27;57:29;"Have I ever talked about this on the show?"
57:29;57:30;"No, I don't think so."
57:30;57:31;"I've always had this weird theory."
57:31;57:36;"I don't have to go into detail, but it's like there's a lot of weird connections between '94 and 2004."
57:36;57:45;"So, for instance, the first OutKast album came out in 1994, and then in 2004, they won Album of the Year for their final album."
57:45;57:48;"And a week later, Kanye's first album came out."
57:48;57:53;"So I've always been interested in things that happened in 2004 because a lot of things just come together."
57:53;57:55;"And I remember a lot of these things."
57:55;57:57;"I remember Kanye's first album coming out in 2004."
57:57;57:58;"That was a big deal for me."
57:58;58:04;"I remember Facebook launching in 2004 because it very quickly came to my school."
58:04;58:07;"You're like one of the first 500 users of Facebook?"
58:07;58:08;"Yeah, I looked it up."
58:08;58:11;"I'm one of the first 5,000 people on Facebook."
58:11;58:16;"So recently I was thinking about it because I was wondering when Tom Goes to the Mayor came out."
58:16;58:19;"That was the first show you and Eric had on TV, right?"
58:19;58:20;"Yeah."
58:20;58:21;"2004, right?"
58:21;58:22;"Yeah."
58:22;58:27;"So I'm just saying in the year 2004, George W. Bush is president, Iraq War is cooking."
58:27;58:29;"It's spiraling out of control."
58:29;58:30;"And I think three--"
58:30;58:31;"Or it's starting to simmer out of control."
58:31;58:40;"Yes, and three things that to me really changed culture, Kanye's first album, Tim and Eric on TV, and Facebook all came out in 2004."
58:40;58:41;"That's a big year."
58:41;58:45;"If we want to go a step deeper, I'll have to do this in maybe like a book format."
58:45;58:52;"I think we could then look at ways in which Kanye changed culture, Tim and Eric changed culture, and Facebook changed culture."
58:52;58:54;"Eventually those things--"
58:54;58:55;"Gave us Donald Trump."
58:55;58:57;"--take on a life of their own and they start to intersect."
58:57;59:00;"I wasn't going to say Trump, but I bet you could make the case."
59:00;59:01;"I guess so."
59:01;59:06;"Eric made some video for Kanye West and I'm on Facebook doing my office hours show."
59:06;59:07;"That's right."
59:07;59:08;"I think we've connected the dots."
59:08;59:09;"Little did you know."
59:09;59:10;"And you have Trump fans calling in."
59:21;59:23;"You know what the Midwest is?"
59:23;59:27;"Young and restless, but restless might snatch your necklace."
59:27;59:30;"The next is might jack your Lexus."
59:30;59:32;"Somebody tell these who Kanye West is."
59:32;59:35;"I walk through the valley of the shower deck is."
59:35;59:38;"Top floor to view alone and leave you breathless."
59:38;59:39;"Try to catch it."
59:39;59:40;"It's kind of hard."
59:40;59:42;"Get choked by the text."
59:42;59:43;"Yeah, yeah, now check the method."
59:43;59:46;"They be asking us questions, harassing, arrest us."
59:46;59:49;"Saying we eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast."
59:49;59:50;"I leave pieces."
59:50;59:51;"What's the basis?"
59:51;59:54;"We ain't going to ever get suits and cases."
59:54;59:57;"A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis."
59:57;01:00:00;"My mama used to say only Jesus could save us."
01:00:00;01:00:04;"Well, Mama, I know I act a fool, but I'll be gone till November."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"I got packs to move."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"I hope Jesus will."
01:00:07;01:00:11;"God show me the way because the devil's trying to break me down."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"Jesus will."
01:00:12;01:00:16;"The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now."
01:00:16;01:00:19;"Jesus will."
01:00:19;01:00:22;"And I don't think there's nothing I can do now to right my wrongs."
01:00:22;01:00:24;"Jesus will."
01:00:24;01:00:27;"I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we've spoken so long."
01:00:27;01:00:29;"Jesus will."
01:00:29;01:00:33;"Anyway, 2004 was a seminal year, but now it's 2017."
01:00:33;01:00:35;"But I don't want to just talk about that because I think--"
01:00:35;01:00:36;"Let's not talk about the old days."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"So this is primarily a music show."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"Yes."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"And increasingly baseball."
01:00:41;01:00:42;"Oh, baseball."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"What are you-- I can't talk about baseball."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"No, we're not."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"Baseball's over."
01:00:46;01:00:48;"It was so-- yeah, it drained me of everything."
01:00:48;01:00:51;"But so you got a new record coming out."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"This is not your first album."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"In a weird way, it's like my seventh album."
01:00:54;01:00:55;"Seventh record."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"So this is your Born in the USA."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"Yeah."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"That was the seventh Bruce album."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"Was it?"
01:01:01;01:01:02;"Is that his seventh official?"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was his seventh official record."
01:01:04;01:01:08;"And then, of course, all throughout your TV stuff,"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"there's always been original music and original songs."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"I'm prolific in that sense."
01:01:13;01:01:16;"One that made a big impression on me was Petite Feet, Feminine Step."
01:01:16;01:01:19;"[MUSIC - PETITE FEET, FEMININE STEP, ""PETITE FEET""]"
01:01:19;01:01:36;"Petite feet, feminine step."
01:01:36;01:01:39;"Sounds like a lady when he's walking in the room."
01:01:39;01:01:43;"He's got petite feet, feminine step."
01:01:43;01:01:46;"Sounds like a lady when he's walking in the room."
01:01:46;01:01:49;"Now this is what a man sounds like when he walks."
01:01:49;01:01:56;"But this is what the dude sounded like when he walked."
01:01:56;01:02:03;"Now this is what a man sounds like when he walks."
01:02:07;01:02:10;"But this is what the dude sounded like when he walked."
01:02:10;01:02:17;"Now this is what a man sounds like when he walks."
01:02:17;01:02:24;"But this is what the dude sounded like when he walked."
01:02:24;01:02:30;"But to take us back a little bit, before we"
01:02:30;01:02:36;"talk about the new album, before your young man growing up"
01:02:36;01:02:37;"in Pennsylvania, right?"
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Yeah."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"Always had a band."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"Had to have a band."
01:02:42;01:02:46;"I think that was the case for a lot of generally creative people."
01:02:46;01:02:50;"Whether you ended up making music or if you became a TV"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"person or an actor or director or something,"
01:02:52;01:02:57;"I bet a lot of people had bands because it was a fraternal thing"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"to do, it was a friendship thing to do."
01:02:59;01:03:02;"It was easy, it was relatively cheap."
01:03:02;01:03:04;"You weren't going to make a movie, you weren't going to make"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"a virtual reality experience."
01:03:06;01:03:15;"You were going to get a PV bass and a Gorilla amp and write songs."
01:03:15;01:03:16;"What else could you do?"
01:03:16;01:03:18;"This was like mid-90s."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"Yeah, 90s."
01:03:19;01:03:22;"So actually, Tim, we were just talking about this before."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"What year did you start high school?"
01:03:24;01:03:28;"I graduated in '94, so I started in '90, '91."
01:03:28;01:03:30;"And did you go straight to college after?"
01:03:30;01:03:31;"Yeah."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"Did you graduate college?"
01:03:32;01:03:33;"Yep."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"You went straight to college in '98?"
01:03:34;01:03:35;"Yep."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"Oh, so you have a new phrase we have on the show called"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"the tight eight."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"[laughter]"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"Where your entire eight years of high school and college"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"was in one decade."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"Oh, okay."
01:03:44;01:03:45;"So Jake had that."
01:03:45;01:03:46;"You guys both had tight eights."
01:03:46;01:03:47;"I'm like, ""You're behind me."""
01:03:47;01:03:48;"I was in the '90s."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"Actually, musically, I had a big seminal year."
01:03:50;01:03:55;"I remember very distinctly my freshman year of college,"
01:03:55;01:03:57;"a couple big records."
01:03:57;01:03:59;"Your freshman year was '94?"
01:03:59;01:04:00;"Yeah."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"Cracked rear view, '94."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"What was that?"
01:04:03;01:04:04;"You don't know the cracked rear view?"
01:04:04;01:04:05;"I know--I can't remember."
01:04:05;01:04:06;"What is it?"
01:04:06;01:04:07;"I'll give you a hint."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"It's the 16th best-selling album in U.S. history."
01:04:09;01:04:13;"Is it--is it--that helps."
01:04:13;01:04:14;"Alanis Morissette?"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"No."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"Good guess."
01:04:16;01:04:17;"No, that's a good guess."
01:04:17;01:04:19;"Give me one more clue that's not chart-related."
01:04:19;01:04:22;"The kind of like syntax of the name is something in the--"
01:04:22;01:04:24;"Hootie and the Blowfish."
01:04:24;01:04:25;"That's right."
01:04:25;01:04:28;"I didn't like--I was cool enough to not like Hootie and the Blowfish."
01:04:28;01:04:29;"Okay?"
01:04:29;01:04:30;"I didn't care."
01:04:30;01:04:31;"Oh, so you were a hipster."
01:04:31;01:04:32;"I was a big hipster."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"What were your records in '94?"
01:04:34;01:04:35;"The Blue album from Weezer."
01:04:35;01:04:36;"Oh, sure."
01:04:36;01:04:37;"Huge."
01:04:37;01:04:38;"Classic."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"Big--I can picture driving down the road with that."
01:04:40;01:04:43;"I was into the Pavement record, Crooked Rain."
01:04:43;01:04:44;"Absolutely."
01:04:44;01:04:47;"I think this was in more of senior year high school,"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"but it was like Smashing Pumpkins, Siamese Dreams."
01:04:49;01:04:50;"Oh, yeah."
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Real big."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"There's another one that--Luna."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"I love that Luna record."
01:04:55;01:04:57;"Oh, it's early Luna."
01:04:57;01:04:58;"I was cool."
01:04:58;01:04:59;"I was a very cool music guy."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"Alt-rock."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"You're an alt-rock guy."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"John Spencer, Blues Explosion."
01:05:03;01:05:04;"Oh, wow."
01:05:04;01:05:05;"A lot of Matador records."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"A lot of Matador."
01:05:06;01:05:07;"A lot of Matador, Yola Tango."
01:05:07;01:05:08;"Oh, yeah."
01:05:08;01:05:10;"A lot of white guys."
01:05:10;01:05:11;"Ween."
01:05:11;01:05:12;"Ween, huge."
01:05:12;01:05:13;"Yeah, of course."
01:05:13;01:05:14;"Big."
01:05:14;01:05:15;"Chocolate and Cheese."
01:06:23;01:06:32;"So you had a very tight eight with a major pivot right in the middle."
01:06:32;01:06:35;"And then the next year, '95, you get Radiohead, right?"
01:06:35;01:06:36;"You get--"
01:06:36;01:06:37;"The Benz."
01:06:37;01:06:38;"Okay."
01:06:38;01:06:40;"Anyways, we're off topic."
01:06:40;01:06:44;"So you were down with Smashing Pumpkins, so you weren't too much of a snob."
01:06:44;01:06:48;"I was really a big classic rock guy when I was in high school."
01:06:48;01:06:54;"I was all about my Beatles, my Stones, my Zep, my Hendrix."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"Steve Miller."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"Whatever was on the local classic rock station."
01:06:57;01:07:01;"But I heard Jimi Hendrix, ""Axis Bold as Love"" in the Pumpkins."
01:07:01;01:07:02;"For sure."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"And I thought that was exciting."
01:07:04;01:07:09;"One thing we talk about on the show a lot is kind of the narcissism of small difference"
01:07:09;01:07:16;"and how when you're like a kid who's into something, these different bands and vibes are huge to you."
01:07:16;01:07:19;"And then to the outside world, they're like, ""This s--t all sounds the same."""
01:07:19;01:07:26;"And then even to kids down the line, to imagine there's a time where Pavement and Smashing Pumpkins would have an ideological beef."
01:07:26;01:07:27;"Right."
01:07:27;01:07:28;"I just heard that on the radio the other day."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"Oh, you didn't know about that at the time."
01:07:30;01:07:34;"Well, you knew about the line from the song from Range Life where he says,"
01:07:34;01:07:38;"""Out on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins, nature kids, but they don't have no function."""
01:07:38;01:07:39;"Yeah."
01:07:39;01:07:40;"I thought, ""Well, what's that about?"""
01:07:40;01:07:42;"I thought the Smashing Pumpkins were cool."
01:07:42;01:07:45;"Now this Pavement group is putting them in check."
01:07:45;01:07:49;"I'm thinking, ""Uh-oh, I better start picking out my sides here."""
01:07:49;01:07:51;"You go with Pavement."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"I had the exact same experience with that record."
01:07:53;01:07:57;"I was starting to smell a rat with that Billy Corrigan."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"He seems like an angry guy."
01:07:59;01:08:00;"But you know what's funny?"
01:08:00;01:08:03;"It's like maybe this is all Stephen Malcomus' fault."
01:08:03;01:08:06;"It seemed like that criticism really affected him."
01:08:06;01:08:07;"I don't remember at the time."
01:08:07;01:08:09;"He was very angry about it because he had a quote where he said,"
01:08:09;01:08:13;"""You know what? Nobody wakes up in the morning with a humming of Pavement's song."""
01:08:13;01:08:17;"He's basically trying to say that he was just a jealous [bleep]"
01:08:17;01:08:22;"The point is this idea that Pavement and Smashing Pumpkins are so, so different."
01:08:22;01:08:25;"Maybe different sensibilities of the singers, but the music is so different."
01:08:25;01:08:29;"Whereas now, there's no music like that on the radio anyway."
01:08:29;01:08:35;"So the idea that there'd be enough room for both of those bands to really be making it done is kind of funny."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"Do you remember this song?"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"Did this mean anything to you?"
01:08:40;01:08:43;"Oh, this was--is this the band Live?"
01:08:43;01:08:44;"No."
01:08:44;01:08:45;"No, that's Collective Soul."
01:08:45;01:08:47;"Collective Soul. Yeah, they were always a joke."
01:08:47;01:08:50;"In 1994, you heard this and you were like, ""Sucks."""
01:08:50;01:08:51;"Yeah, yeah."
01:08:51;01:08:54;"Harold's down for Rare Harold."
01:08:54;01:08:58;"We used to make fun of this guy singing because it sounded like he was ripping off Eddie Vedder."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"Yeah, many people were."
01:08:59;01:09:00;"Yeah, a lot of people were."
01:09:00;01:09:03;"But this guy seemed to be most flagrant."
01:09:03;01:09:04;"I just hated it."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"I hated the sound of this record."
01:09:06;01:09:08;"I hated the production of it."
01:09:08;01:09:09;"I hated the voice."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"Okay, but what about listening to it now?"
01:09:11;01:09:12;"Now you're a grown man."
01:09:12;01:09:14;"All right, give me some fresh ears."
01:09:14;01:09:15;"And a beer."
01:09:15;01:09:17;"Is this so bad?"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"Yes, it is. Wait."
01:09:19;01:09:20;"[singing]"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"Okay, that's the worst part."
01:09:22;01:09:26;"Listen to that fuzz--what's it called? Big Muff."
01:09:26;01:09:28;"[laughing]"
01:09:28;01:09:29;"But is the--"
01:09:29;01:09:30;"[singing]"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"Okay, the chorus is pretty good."
01:09:32;01:09:34;"Gotta get your light shine down."
01:09:34;01:09:35;"What does that mean?"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"[singing]"
01:09:37;01:09:39;"It drags."
01:09:39;01:09:40;"I think it drags."
01:09:40;01:09:42;"It's in the pocket."
01:09:42;01:09:43;"[laughing]"
01:09:43;01:09:46;"This guy's got a laid-back feel."
01:09:46;01:09:47;"Okay, but like--"
01:09:47;01:09:48;"Collective soul."
01:09:48;01:09:49;"The production's not bad."
01:09:49;01:09:52;"That reeked of inauthenticity to me in high school."
01:09:52;01:09:54;"I do recall that."
01:09:54;01:09:55;"That was '94."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"Feeling like, ""This guy's--what is this?"""
01:09:57;01:10:04;"It's like the grunge version of Asia or those bands in the '70s and '80s that were just like session guys."
01:10:04;01:10:05;"Toto."
01:10:05;01:10:06;"Toto, yeah."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Yeah, but now everybody loves Toto."
01:10:08;01:10:10;"Okay, well, maybe--"
01:10:10;01:10:11;"This is Ezra's philosophy."
01:10:11;01:10:12;"--Collective soul's going to become the cool band."
01:10:12;01:10:13;"I don't know."
01:10:13;01:10:18;"I'm just saying, like, I wonder if you played for a kid that and then you played some pavement today,"
01:10:18;01:10:21;"if you'd be like, ""Obviously the pavement's cooler,"" and they'd be like, ""I don't know, man."
01:10:21;01:10:23;"""That collective soul song was kind of catchier."""
01:10:23;01:10:24;"Yeah."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"""Had a more traditional structure."""
01:10:26;01:10:27;"How does this sound?"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"Speaking of 1994, how does this sound to you now?"
01:10:34;01:10:35;"It's good."
01:10:35;01:10:38;"It's a jingle not dissimilar from some--"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"I don't want to be with you."
01:10:40;01:10:42;"I would take this over the collective soul."
01:10:42;01:10:43;"Really?"
01:10:43;01:10:44;"Yeah."
01:10:44;01:10:45;"Yeah, I like this."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"This has got a lot more life to it."
01:10:49;01:10:51;"See, he leans into that--"
01:10:51;01:10:53;"He's also very veteran."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"He's bettering it up."
01:10:54;01:10:58;"I wonder if veteran was like an active influence on him or if that was just like the zeitgeist of the era."
01:10:58;01:10:59;"Yeah, what happened?"
01:10:59;01:11:02;"Maybe they're just all drinking from the same well."
01:11:13;01:11:15;"It's a good song, structurally."
01:11:15;01:11:16;"Off-tempo."
01:11:16;01:11:18;"Could have been like an Allman Brothers song."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"It does sound like an Allman Brothers song."
01:11:20;01:11:22;"They're from the South, right?"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"Yeah, they're from South Carolina."
01:11:24;01:11:27;"You know what else was big in '94 was Four Non-Blondes."
01:11:27;01:11:28;"Oh, yeah."
01:11:28;01:11:29;"I disliked that song."
01:11:29;01:11:30;"Really?"
01:11:30;01:11:31;"Yeah."
01:11:31;01:11:32;"You know, it's funny."
01:11:32;01:11:38;"We were just talking about-- because Jake's always believed that the '60s was a really special time for political music."
01:11:38;01:11:41;"The '60s changed everything, man."
01:11:41;01:11:44;"The way you put that is so brutal."
01:11:44;01:11:47;"Without the '60s, you don't get the '70s."
01:11:47;01:11:48;"That's right."
01:11:48;01:11:49;"You don't get the '80s."
01:11:49;01:11:50;"Forget about the '80s."
01:11:50;01:11:54;"So we were talking about was the music actually all that much more political?"
01:11:54;01:11:57;"And the funniest example to think of is Buffalo Springfield."
01:11:57;01:11:59;"Something's happening around here."
01:11:59;01:12:00;"That's the best."
01:12:00;01:12:01;"The '80s?"
01:12:01;01:12:03;"Ain't exactly clear."
01:12:03;01:12:05;"You know what's even better about that?"
01:12:05;01:12:09;"That song, for what it's worth-- that's the title of the song, by the way--"
01:12:09;01:12:13;"what inspired that song was not the Vietnam War, not civil rights."
01:12:13;01:12:21;"It was the Sunset Strip had begun having these shows, like rock concerts in the clubs and everything, and they were all ages."
01:12:21;01:12:25;"And the cops put a curfew in effect."
01:12:25;01:12:36;"And these overprivileged white sons of cinematographers in the Hollywood Hills rioted and freaked out because they were told to go home at midnight or something."
01:12:36;01:12:44;"And Stephen Stills saw these protests or whatever from these kids, and he wrote this paranoia in the streets."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"Oh, so that's what he's getting."
01:12:46;01:12:48;"So much resistance from the heat."
01:12:48;01:12:49;"Yeah, pretty much."
01:12:49;01:12:52;"But, I mean, it got co-opted by all the movements, I guess."
01:12:52;01:12:53;"Well, this is a [bleep] cool song."
01:12:53;01:12:54;"It's a great song."
01:12:54;01:12:55;"Power of the song."
01:12:55;01:13:00;"Well, I was thinking that this-- you point out Four Non Blondes-- this is kind of the '90s version of that song."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"Like, it's a similar sentiment."
01:13:03;01:13:05;"What's going on?"
01:13:05;01:13:10;"What's neat about this song, in retrospect, is that it is kind of a novelty song, right?"
01:13:10;01:13:11;"Right."
01:13:11;01:13:12;"At the heart of it."
01:13:12;01:13:14;"But it got major radio play."
01:13:14;01:13:18;"I mean, it was on the radio every day that I remember going to school."
01:13:18;01:13:19;"It was just like--"
01:13:19;01:13:20;"So '90s."
01:13:20;01:13:26;"But it is-- the way she sings, the way the chorus-- it's very much a novelty song."
01:13:26;01:13:36;"Everybody sang ""Crazy"" in the '90s."
01:13:36;01:13:37;"There's nothing wrong with it."
01:13:37;01:13:41;"It's very basic."
01:13:41;01:13:42;"Very bass."
01:13:43;01:13:46;"I realized quickly when I knew I should"
01:13:46;01:13:51;"That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man"
01:13:51;01:13:55;"For whatever that means"
01:13:55;01:14:01;"Into a crazier times when our mind made the decision"
01:14:01;01:14:02;"And this, like, is--"
01:14:02;01:14:03;"Well, hold on."
01:14:03;01:14:06;"This became a real karaoke-bar cliche."
01:14:06;01:14:11;"This gives way to that ""If I would walk 500 miles, then I would"""
01:14:11;01:14:13;"Another great song."
01:14:13;01:14:19;"I mean, people like to make fun of this song, but, like, you know what?"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"Try to karaoke this at your own peril."
01:14:21;01:14:24;"'Cause she's got a killer set of pipes."
01:14:24;01:14:26;"And she went on to be a major producer, right?"
01:14:26;01:14:28;"Yeah, that's right, and songwriter."
01:14:28;01:14:39;"That's what we're saying to this day still."
01:14:39;01:14:44;"Yeah. I just want to say also, like, it's really easy to make fun of songs"
01:14:44;01:14:48;"That kind of just earnestly say, ""Something's happening around here."""
01:14:48;01:14:51;"What it is ain't clear, or else the song would say, ""What's going on?"""
01:14:51;01:14:52;"But, like--"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"After Marvin Gaye already asked the question."
01:14:54;01:14:57;"Okay, yeah, I guess when you put it that way--"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"Oh, you know what? I just realized."
01:14:59;01:15:02;"That's why this ""Four Non Blondes"" song is not called ""What's Going On."""
01:15:02;01:15:03;"It's called ""What's Up?"""
01:15:03;01:15:05;"'Cause they couldn't probably--"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"They didn't have the right to say what's going on."
01:15:07;01:15:09;"It wasn't a wise move to call it ""What's Going On."""
01:15:09;01:15:12;"But, you know, on a basic level, it's very human."
01:15:12;01:15:14;"Just to say, like, you don't have to pretend you have the answer."
01:15:14;01:15:18;"Sometimes all you do is just write a catchy song and say, ""What's going on?"""
01:15:18;01:15:21;"I remember hearing that every morning in the car going to school."
01:15:21;01:15:25;"And being so mad at my local rock station for playing it."
01:15:25;01:15:28;"I think 'cause I was mad-- I think 'cause it was a woman."
01:15:28;01:15:30;"Oh, really? You were a sexist rock fan?"
01:15:30;01:15:33;"I think it was like, ""Come on, man. Where's Robert Plant?"""
01:15:35;01:15:37;"I've changed my position on that."
01:15:37;01:15:38;"So you weren't a whole fan?"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"No, probably not. I wasn't a big Nirvana fan, actually."
01:15:40;01:15:41;"Interesting."
01:15:41;01:15:46;"So do you feel like, in a weird way, having been a disaffected white kid,"
01:15:46;01:15:50;"albeit in the early '90s, used to call the local rock station and say--"
01:15:50;01:15:53;"Complain when they're playing. I remember they had a vote."
01:15:53;01:15:54;"I'm not kidding about that."
01:15:54;01:15:59;"They had a vote on the classic rock station whether to play the Sinéad O'Connor song."
01:15:59;01:16:01;"""Nothing Compares to You."""
01:16:01;01:16:02;"""Incredible Song."""
01:16:02;01:16:05;"Yeah, ""Unbelievable."" That's an unbelievable song."
01:16:05;01:16:07;"And some other rock song that was--"
01:16:07;01:16:10;"Maybe it was Bon Jovi or some [bleep] rock song."
01:16:10;01:16:12;"Like, ""Which should we choose?"" And I called up,"
01:16:12;01:16:16;"""How dare you even consider playing that Sinéad O'Connor [bleep] song?"""
01:16:16;01:16:23;"♪ I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant ♪"
01:16:23;01:16:31;"♪ But nothing, I said, nothing can take away this blues ♪"
01:16:31;01:16:36;"♪ 'Cause nothing compares ♪"
01:16:36;01:16:45;"♪ Nothing compares to you ♪"
01:16:45;01:16:48;"As a young kid, you had a misogynist streak in rock--"
01:16:48;01:16:53;"Misogynist. I was probably more aligned with George Bush,"
01:16:53;01:16:56;"the senior, than I would have been with Bill Clinton."
01:16:56;01:17:01;"I was born in a Republican house with a conservative family."
01:17:01;01:17:06;"I was artistic and creative and I had friends who were gay and I had that going on,"
01:17:06;01:17:09;"but I think I was already breaking out of that--"
01:17:09;01:17:11;"Right, so it was a transitional period."
01:17:11;01:17:14;"But there was certainly like earlier in high school."
01:17:14;01:17:17;"So do you feel like with these alt-right kids, they've called into your show and stuff."
01:17:17;01:17:18;"Yeah."
01:17:18;01:17:21;"Do you feel like you understand them better than most?"
01:17:21;01:17:25;"I think I probably do, and I think I don't let it get me too upset"
01:17:25;01:17:29;"because I know a lot of them are just going to plain grow out of it."
01:17:29;01:17:34;"And a lot of them will just go to college or they'll go get a job"
01:17:34;01:17:40;"and they'll discover more people in the world and just mellow out"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"and become a little more empathetic."
01:17:42;01:17:44;"So what was your journey to mellowing out?"
01:17:44;01:17:49;"I grew up in Allentown, Pennsylvania, which is a very small town outside of Philadelphia."
01:17:49;01:17:53;"Not that small, but it was small enough that I didn't really know anybody that didn't look like me."
01:17:53;01:17:56;"And I went to Temple University in North Philly,"
01:17:56;01:18:01;"which is about the biggest dichotomy you can imagine of environments."
01:18:01;01:18:03;"It was the ghetto of Philadelphia."
01:18:03;01:18:09;"And I was exposed to all kinds of different people that I didn't grow up around and stuff."
01:18:09;01:18:14;"And then you took--listen, college--they're not kidding about college liberalizing you."
01:18:14;01:18:19;"I took classes where they gave you the Howard Zinn books to read and everything"
01:18:19;01:18:23;"and exposed you to multiculturalism and all kinds of stuff like that."
01:18:23;01:18:25;"And I think it's a positive thing."
01:18:25;01:18:27;"But there is that--"
01:18:27;01:18:31;"So you're a case study of a kid going down the wrong path"
01:18:31;01:18:36;"who went to college, took one gender studies course, and finally realized Sinead O'Connor's good."
01:18:36;01:18:41;"Yeah, I took a lot of those--because those were the easy classes."
01:18:41;01:18:42;"Oh, okay."
01:18:42;01:18:45;"I got a question. Are you a communist?"
01:18:45;01:18:46;"No."
01:18:46;01:18:47;"Socialist?"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"No, I don't think so."
01:18:49;01:18:50;"I've just always been--"
01:18:50;01:18:53;"I don't really understand what I am."
01:18:53;01:18:59;"I'm socially liberal, fiscally--I wouldn't say conservative,"
01:18:59;01:19:05;"but you feel like you want to be smart with the money that we have?"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"You want to try to spend it wisely?"
01:19:07;01:19:08;"I hear you, man."
01:19:08;01:19:09;"I don't know."
01:19:09;01:19:13;"I just think, in a funny way, the stuff you've done on TV--"
01:19:13;01:19:18;"I think I've seen people make the case that Tim and Eric sometimes seem like a critique of capitalism."
01:19:18;01:19:22;"Definitely the commercialism, which is tied into capitalism,"
01:19:22;01:19:29;"but sort of the craven commercialism of late-night infomercials and stuff like that."
01:19:29;01:19:32;"There's certainly elements of that."
01:19:32;01:19:36;"But I do think I can be easily persuaded into socialism."
01:19:36;01:19:44;"I think the bigger macro issues coming our way, like a tsunami of the automation"
01:19:44;01:19:50;"and the fundamental changes in the way that people are expected to work and earn livings,"
01:19:50;01:19:54;"is going to force us into some kind of socialist system."
01:19:54;01:19:55;"Something's going to change."
01:19:55;01:19:59;"Because what are these guys that built trucks supposed to do?"
01:19:59;01:20:01;"And they don't need to be building trucks anymore."
01:20:01;01:20:03;"No one's given an answer for that."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"Or not even build trucks, drive trucks."
01:20:05;01:20:09;"Or put gas in the trucks or clean them."
01:20:09;01:20:12;"I mean, it's all going to be automated in 20 years."
01:20:12;01:20:17;"And also chipping away at this concept of work being something that somebody wants to do."
01:20:17;01:20:19;"Like, work sucks."
01:20:19;01:20:20;"We hate work."
01:20:20;01:20:22;"I hate work, man."
01:20:22;01:20:26;"Jobs, like manual labor, repetitive labor, it's very unhealthy."
01:20:26;01:20:27;"It's bad."
01:20:27;01:20:29;"It doesn't provide any satisfaction to the person."
01:20:29;01:20:34;"So you have to create other things in that person's life to give them satisfaction."
01:20:34;01:20:36;"You have to create sports teams to root for."
01:20:36;01:20:39;"And you have to do all this stuff to fill in those gaps."
01:20:39;01:20:43;"So when all that stuff gets torn down in the next quarter century,"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"there's going to be some big questions that need to be answered."
01:22:34;01:22:36;"So tell us about your new album."
01:22:36;01:22:41;"Well, it's just a collection of songs that I've put out this year."
01:22:41;01:22:45;"I think last year, once the election of Donald Trump happened,"
01:22:45;01:22:49;"I think a little bit before that, when he was running and the election was going on,"
01:22:49;01:22:56;"I would kind of freak out, and I did what I would often do in other times in my life."
01:22:56;01:23:00;"I'd kind of go down to my garage and play piano and sing about it."
01:23:00;01:23:03;"And some of the songs seemed to--I liked them."
01:23:03;01:23:05;"I liked what came out of me."
01:23:05;01:23:10;"And so I'd put them out on my website on Bandcamp."
01:23:10;01:23:12;"And the more I did it, the more people liked it,"
01:23:12;01:23:14;"the more I felt encouraged to keep doing it."
01:23:14;01:23:19;"And so throughout the year, when an idea came to me, I would put it out."
01:23:19;01:23:22;"It was fun to put something out on a Friday night,"
01:23:22;01:23:26;"and then all these music sites just picked up on them,"
01:23:26;01:23:29;"and Pitchfork and everybody was like, ""He's released another one."""
01:23:29;01:23:33;"I released this Richard Spencer song the day after he got punched."
01:23:33;01:23:37;"And I had this little two-minute--I mean, it's a real little ditty."
01:23:37;01:23:41;"It's just this two-minute little song about punching Richard Spencer."
01:23:41;01:23:44;"I put it out on a Saturday night."
01:23:44;01:23:47;"I just said that there was a song on my page."
01:23:47;01:23:50;"It was everywhere the next day, like on all those blogs."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"And I didn't promote it very much."
01:23:52;01:23:54;"I just kind of let it lay out there."
01:23:54;01:23:58;"So those built up to enough where my label, Jag Jaguar,"
01:23:58;01:24:00;"was like, ""We should put these out in a real way,"""
01:24:00;01:24:03;"because they're all just kind of spread out."
01:24:03;01:24:07;"And so they mastered it and made a nice album cover for it."
01:24:07;01:24:09;"Friend of the show, Eric Yonker, did the cover."
01:24:09;01:24:11;"Oh, is he a friend of the show?"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"Yeah, yeah, he's been on before. Remember when--"
01:24:13;01:24:17;"His cover is unbelievable, and it's controversial"
01:24:17;01:24:21;"and all that kind of cool stuff that you want cool things to be."
01:24:21;01:24:25;"So I got a lot of reaction. A lot of people like it."
01:24:25;01:24:29;"A lot of people think it's very lame to be making fun of Trump"
01:24:29;01:24:32;"because it's a low-hanging fruit."
01:24:32;01:24:35;"One thing that we've always been interested in on this show is--"
01:24:35;01:24:38;"and me personally--is tone."
01:24:38;01:24:43;"And I think as somebody who's kind of known as a comedian,"
01:24:43;01:24:47;"but even your comedy has a lot of different tones."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"It's interesting, like, with your music career,"
01:24:49;01:24:52;"there's a lot of people known for comedy who go into music,"
01:24:52;01:24:57;"and it's like comedy albums, like your classic Adam Sandler thing."
01:24:57;01:24:58;"Adam Sandler in the '90s--"
01:24:58;01:24:59;"Novelty songs."
01:24:59;01:25:02;"By the way, sold more records than a lot of rock bands."
01:25:02;01:25:04;"I looked it up. He's like--I think each of his albums--"
01:25:04;01:25:05;"All for one!"
01:25:05;01:25:06;"--is like four times platinum."
01:25:06;01:25:07;"Right."
01:25:07;01:25:08;"Jesus Christ."
01:25:08;01:25:10;"Adam Sandler probably sold more records than Collective Soul."
01:25:10;01:25:12;"[explosion]"
01:25:12;01:25:14;"Just when we're thinking about the '90s."
01:25:14;01:25:15;"Yeah."
01:25:15;01:25:19;"But you're somebody who, like, you make some songs that are obviously funny,"
01:25:19;01:25:22;"and then you make songs that are not straightforwardly comedy songs."
01:25:22;01:25:26;"You also have more musicianship and kind of love for music"
01:25:26;01:25:29;"than some, like, straight-up comedy people."
01:25:29;01:25:32;"Like, where does this album fall on the spectrum of, like, your music"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"and the tone of your music?"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"There's definitely funny songs."
01:25:35;01:25:38;"I think Mar-a-Lago's a funny song."
01:25:38;01:25:43;"There's funny ideas, and there's really sad, tragic ideas in it."
01:25:43;01:25:47;"My hero, when it comes to songwriting, has always been Randy Newman."
01:25:47;01:25:51;"And I got really deep into Randy Newman four or five years ago,"
01:25:51;01:25:56;"dug into his '70s records, a record called ""Good Old Boys"" in particular,"
01:25:56;01:25:59;"which is a perfect album, in my opinion."
01:25:59;01:26:02;"It's a 10 if I was writing for Pitchfork."
01:26:02;01:26:04;"[laughter]"
01:26:04;01:26:05;"I'll let you do a guest review."
01:26:05;01:26:11;"And it vacillates between sort of satirical, political commentary"
01:26:11;01:26:17;"and then terribly sad songs and very, very funny songs."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"And musically, it's the best."
01:26:19;01:26:22;"It's just so beautifully made."
01:26:22;01:26:26;"So that inspires me to, if I have a funny line or a funny perspective"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"on something, to pursue that."
01:26:28;01:26:31;"But this song on the record called ""Wilbur Ross,"""
01:26:31;01:26:35;"who Wilbur Ross is Trump's Commerce Secretary, I think."
01:26:35;01:26:36;"He looks like a turtle."
01:26:36;01:26:38;"He looks like a turtle."
01:26:38;01:26:42;"And where I grew up in Allentown, the neighboring town is Bethlehem,"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"and Bethlehem Steel was a big--"
01:26:44;01:26:45;"Yeah, famously."
01:26:45;01:26:48;"And one of the things we learned about Wilbur Ross is back in the '80s,"
01:26:48;01:26:52;"he basically bought Bethlehem Steel and sold it for scrap."
01:26:52;01:26:55;"He just decimated the town."
01:26:55;01:26:59;"So there's a very personal, hurtful feeling towards people like that."
01:26:59;01:27:02;"But I did learn something about him, that he wears these slippers"
01:27:02;01:27:05;"that are embroidered with the Department of Commerce,"
01:27:05;01:27:08;"and he has this collection of $500 slippers."
01:27:08;01:27:10;"That's the only shoes he wears."
01:27:10;01:27:12;"So that's absurd."
01:27:12;01:27:14;"And so the first line in the song is,"
01:27:14;01:27:19;"""Wilbur Ross puts his slippers on, just like all of us, $500 at a time."
01:27:19;01:27:21;"I don't see what's all the fuss."""
01:27:21;01:27:23;"So that's kind of a funny line."
01:27:23;01:27:26;"But then the second verse, I go into the point of view"
01:27:26;01:27:33;"of a West Virginia miner whose sister is on heroin,"
01:27:33;01:27:40;"and I just went for it as a real lyric about real people that I see on TV"
01:27:40;01:27:44;"and that I probably would know if I was still living in Allentown"
01:27:44;01:27:49;"that's absolutely and totally intentionally sincere"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"about what these people are like"
01:27:51;01:27:54;"and what they expect of people like Wilbur Ross to do for them"
01:27:54;01:27:56;"and how they're disappointed in them."
01:27:56;01:28:01;"And so I'm proud of the fact that you can go from the two different levels"
01:28:01;01:28:05;"of funny little one-liners to some serious subject matter."
01:28:05;01:28:09;"It wouldn't tell the whole story to call it a political comedy album."
01:28:09;01:28:11;"You can shorthand it that way fine."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"Sure, but there's more to it."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"You're not going to fight that."
01:28:15;01:28:20;"So we have to ask you, because on this show, from day one,"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"we've always talked about Billy Joel a lot."
01:28:22;01:28:28;"And of course, nationally, your hometown was really--"
01:28:28;01:28:31;"for a lot of people, they heard about it with the song ""Allentown."""
01:28:31;01:28:32;"Great song."
01:28:32;01:28:35;"As an Allentown native, what do you think of that song?"
01:28:35;01:28:38;"Well, it connected to what I just said about Wilbur Ross."
01:28:38;01:28:40;"It should have been ""I'm living here in Bethlehem,"""
01:28:40;01:28:43;"but I understand why you didn't do that, because that's--"
01:28:43;01:28:46;"Because of the emphasis on the syllable."
01:28:46;01:28:48;"And that the rest of the world--"
01:28:48;01:28:50;"Then they think it's a Christmas song."
01:28:50;01:28:52;"Yeah, but Bethlehem was truly--"
01:28:52;01:28:54;"Billy Joel is an international artist."
01:28:54;01:28:56;"He can't have that kind of confusion."
01:28:56;01:28:58;"Is Allentown not considered a steel town?"
01:28:58;01:29:01;"No, but it's really right next to Bethlehem."
01:29:01;01:29:04;"So I'm sure people lived in both areas."
01:29:04;01:29:07;"You never encountered any Allentown resistance to the fact,"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"like, why is this guy writing a song about art?"
01:29:09;01:29:11;"There was a little bit of that."
01:29:11;01:29:13;"I remember there being a little, what does he know?"
01:29:13;01:29:15;"First of all, he's from New York."
01:29:15;01:29:18;"He's a big pop star with a model wife, you know, Christy Brinkley, right?"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Right, the Uptown Girl herself."
01:29:20;01:29:23;"He got his Uptown Girl. He forgot about the downtown."
01:29:23;01:29:25;"There was a little bit of, like--"
01:29:25;01:29:28;"And I think in general, probably, what does this guy--"
01:29:28;01:29:30;"And also, what are you, Bruce Springsteen?"
01:29:30;01:29:33;"Well, obviously he was trying to keep up with Springsteen at that moment."
01:29:33;01:29:37;"But looking back on it, it's a pretty crafty little song."
01:29:37;01:29:40;"Yeah. Somebody-- Who was it that told me recently"
01:29:40;01:29:43;"that they saw Billy Joel at a massive concert,"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"because he's been doing kind of like a stadium tour,"
01:29:45;01:29:48;"and they said that when he plays Allentown,"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"it has an infamous beginning."
01:29:50;01:29:52;"[imitates drum roll]"
01:29:52;01:29:54;"[laughs]"
01:29:54;01:29:56;"That's pretty--"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"And then it kicks in."
01:29:58;01:30:01;"So somebody told me that they saw him sometime recently,"
01:30:01;01:30:03;"and, you know, it's Billy Joel's."
01:30:03;01:30:05;"It's like a big razzle-dazzle production,"
01:30:05;01:30:08;"but he's also still this kind of funny, sarcastic dude."
01:30:08;01:30:10;"So it's time for Allentown,"
01:30:10;01:30:13;"and, like, the lights go out in the stadium,"
01:30:13;01:30:16;"and, like, some big smokestacks are on stage,"
01:30:16;01:30:18;"and then just, like, you hear..."
01:30:18;01:30:19;"[hissing]"
01:30:19;01:30:22;"And then there's just, like, real steam coming out"
01:30:22;01:30:24;"and, like, crazy lights."
01:30:24;01:30:26;"Like, he momentarily turns into a factory."
01:30:26;01:30:28;"The drums kick in, and he's like--"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"And he's like, ""Stop, stop, stop!"""
01:30:30;01:30:32;"And he's like, ""Ah, I'm sorry. We f---ed up."""
01:30:32;01:30:34;"And then they kind of turn the lights back on,"
01:30:34;01:30:36;"and he's like, ""Should we take it from the top?"""
01:30:36;01:30:38;"And they're like, ""Yeah."" And of course all this stuff is programmed."
01:30:38;01:30:40;"You got the dude doing the lights and stuff."
01:30:40;01:30:42;"Then they, like, take it from the top."
01:30:42;01:30:44;"And then it's, like, this whole production again"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"of just, like, this steam coming out."
01:30:46;01:30:48;"And then they kick into it."

01:35:18;01:35:19;"Okay. Nicki Minaj?"
01:35:19;01:35:20;"Heard of it."
01:35:21;01:35:22;"New York."
01:35:22;01:35:23;"She's from New York. And Cardi B."
01:35:23;01:35:24;"Don't know that."
01:35:24;01:35:27;"She's a little newer as a truly famous person."

01:39:26;01:39:27;"Shine on you, crazy diamond."
01:39:27;01:39:28;"I can see that."
01:39:28;01:39:30;"This guy, Post Malone, I like him."
01:39:30;01:39:33;"Do you think I could, with the right producer,"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"make this kind of music pretty easily?"
01:39:35;01:39:37;"Or do you think it's not so easy?"
01:39:37;01:39:38;"Well--"
01:39:38;01:39:40;"Obviously, I've got a terrific sense of melody--"
01:39:40;01:39:41;"Yeah."
01:39:41;01:39:42;"--and song structure."
01:39:42;01:39:43;"I have a point of view."
01:39:43;01:39:44;"Well, here's the thing--"
01:39:44;01:39:45;"Could you take one of my songs and sort of"
01:39:45;01:39:47;"meld it into this kind of sound?"
01:39:47;01:39:49;"This type of music, it's like anything."
01:39:49;01:39:51;"The same way that somebody could listen to rock music"
01:39:51;01:39:53;"and say, ""Hey, just get a guitar, bass, drums."""
01:39:53;01:39:54;"It's easy."
01:39:54;01:39:56;"But I'm saying, with this type of music,"
01:39:56;01:40:00;"yes, you could go download some instrumentals off YouTube."
01:40:00;01:40:02;"There literally have been hit songs that were made that way."
01:40:02;01:40:04;"Somebody downloaded something that's like trap beat four"
01:40:04;01:40:05;"and it becomes a hit."
01:40:05;01:40:06;"Right."
01:40:06;01:40:07;"So you could find the beat."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"You got Auto-Tune in your Pro Tools."
01:40:09;01:40:10;"Mm-hmm."
01:40:10;01:40:11;"Okay, so you--"
01:40:11;01:40:12;"Logic."
01:40:12;01:40:13;"Oh, in your Logic?"
01:40:13;01:40:14;"Okay, so you use some Auto-Tune."
01:40:14;01:40:15;"You could get the vocal sound very easily."
01:40:15;01:40:17;"So these are open secrets."
01:40:17;01:40:19;"It's not hard to get that vocal sound."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"Post Malone, it's not like he's the only guy doing this."
01:40:21;01:40:25;"There's hundreds of thousands of kids on SoundCloud"
01:40:25;01:40:26;"making songs like this."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"I bet you could make something that sounded"
01:40:28;01:40:31;"professional rap song very quickly."
01:40:31;01:40:32;"Yeah."
01:40:32;01:40:34;"Could you make one that was a huge hit?"
01:40:34;01:40:35;"That's the hard part."
01:40:35;01:40:36;"That's always the big question."
01:40:36;01:40:38;"And I think you should try."
01:40:38;01:40:39;"I don't want to."
01:40:39;01:40:40;"You've been--"
01:40:40;01:40:42;"I don't want to try."
01:40:42;01:40:44;"Well, do you appreciate that that song is called ""Rockstar"""
01:40:44;01:40:45;"as a rock fan?"
01:40:45;01:40:48;"That seems pretty first draft to me."
01:40:48;01:40:49;"Really?"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"Call it ""Rockstar."" It doesn't matter."
01:40:51;01:40:54;"How long did that take for Post Malone to come up with ""Rockstar""?"
01:40:54;01:40:57;"He's looking at that 20-ounce bottle of energy drink"
01:40:57;01:40:58;"he was drinking at the time."
01:40:58;01:41:00;"Post Malone's a very interesting guy."
01:41:00;01:41:01;"Okay, I'll look into him more."
01:41:01;01:41:02;"Look into Post Malone."
01:41:02;01:41:03;"Post Malone."
01:41:03;01:41:04;"And also look into Migos."
01:41:04;01:41:05;"I think there are Migos songs you'd like."
01:41:05;01:41:06;"Okay."
01:41:06;01:41:09;"Well, we'll see."
01:41:09;01:41:10;"We'll make you--"
01:41:10;01:41:13;"You got any Joni Mitchell coming up?"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"Joni's got a new album coming out."
01:41:15;01:41:16;"Oh, really?"
01:41:16;01:41:17;"The single's a big hit."
01:41:17;01:41:19;"No."
01:41:19;01:41:21;"The number three song, Camila Cabello."
01:41:21;01:41:22;"I don't know."
01:41:22;01:41:25;"Do you know who Fifth Harmony is?"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"Yes, I think so."
01:41:27;01:41:28;"Maybe your daughter--"
01:41:28;01:41:31;"You know what's funny about them is my ""In Glendale"" album,"
01:41:31;01:41:33;"the single on that record was called ""Work From Home."""
01:41:33;01:41:34;"Oh, and they had the song--"
01:41:34;01:41:36;"And they had a song called ""Work From Home."""
01:41:36;01:41:37;"Yeah."
01:41:37;01:41:38;"And it came out the same week."
01:41:38;01:41:39;"It was very annoying."
01:41:39;01:41:40;"Oh."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"Maybe I got some sales off of accidental--"
01:41:42;01:41:44;"Yes, who knows?"
01:41:44;01:41:45;"It was a blessing in disguise."
01:41:45;01:41:48;"Camila Cabello used to be a member of Fifth Harmony."
01:41:48;01:41:50;"And this is her song ""Havana,"""
01:41:50;01:41:53;"which has been staying pretty strong in the top five,"
01:41:53;01:41:54;"featuring Young Thug."
01:41:57;01:41:59;"There's that piano that you're hoping you wanted."
01:41:59;01:42:01;"Little upright attitude, love it."
01:42:01;01:42:02;"Yeah."
01:42:16;01:42:18;"This has got to bust into something soon, right?"
01:42:18;01:42:19;"The bust in?"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"I think they'll kick it up a notch."
01:42:24;01:42:25;"Bassline drop."
01:42:25;01:42:27;"Still hasn't gotten all the way there yet."
01:42:34;01:42:37;"You kind of see where it's going the whole time, right?"
01:42:37;01:42:38;"A little bit?"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"Is that a good thing?"
01:42:40;01:42:42;"It's familiar, I guess."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"It's all right."
01:42:44;01:42:46;"It reminds me of that collective soul song"
01:42:46;01:42:48;"where it kind of plods along."
01:42:48;01:42:49;"[laughs]"
01:42:49;01:42:52;"Camila Cabello is a big collective soul fan."
01:42:52;01:42:55;"So, okay, so it seemed like the first two songs,"
01:42:55;01:42:58;"you're not up on new rap music."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"It's a little disoriented."
01:42:59;01:43:01;"But so are you the type of person,"
01:43:01;01:43:05;"because you love acoustic analog stuff so much,"
01:43:05;01:43:07;"as soon as you hear that real sounding piano,"
01:43:07;01:43:08;"you're more engaged?"
01:43:08;01:43:09;"I'm intrigued."
01:43:09;01:43:12;"I can visually see the instrument."
01:43:12;01:43:13;"I can connect to it."
01:43:13;01:43:14;"Okay, well, it's interesting."
01:43:14;01:43:15;"Actually, we've been getting,"
01:43:15;01:43:18;"as we go on to the number two song on this week's top five,"
01:43:18;01:43:22;"we've been getting progressively more organic."
01:43:22;01:43:26;"Because we started motorsport and rock star are totally,"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"you know, beats are electronic music."
01:43:28;01:43:30;"The only organic thing is the vocal."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"Havana is somewhere in between."
01:43:31;01:43:34;"And this guy, this guy gets on stage"
01:43:34;01:43:37;"in front of thousands and thousands of people,"
01:43:37;01:43:38;"just his voice and his guitar."
01:43:38;01:43:39;"Sheeran."
01:43:39;01:43:40;"That's right."
01:43:40;01:43:42;"I know him."
01:43:42;01:43:43;"Because you're a fan?"
01:43:43;01:43:44;"No."
01:43:44;01:43:46;"You know him socially?"
01:43:46;01:43:48;"No, I just know that I've seen him."
01:43:48;01:43:51;"He's big enough that he comes into my little circle."
01:43:51;01:43:53;"So as somebody vaguely knows about Sheeran,"
01:43:53;01:43:54;"who is he to you?"
01:43:54;01:43:55;"What does he represent?"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"You know, I think he's got a little too much"
01:43:57;01:44:03;"of that post-American idol show-off vocal acrobatics"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"that I don't like."
01:44:04;01:44:05;"Well, let's hear the song."
01:44:05;01:44:08;"Because on paper, his palette is not that different"
01:44:08;01:44:11;"than some, you know, Joni Mitchell blue."
01:44:11;01:44:12;"Well, I mean..."
01:44:12;01:44:14;"That's a big..."
01:44:14;01:44:16;"Miles away, bro."
01:44:16;01:44:17;"What have we got so far?"
01:44:17;01:44:18;"Organ?"

01:44:20;01:44:21;"Vocals?"
01:44:21;01:44:24;"A soulful delivery?"
01:44:27;01:44:29;"A little Jeff Buckley."
01:44:33;01:44:34;"So you can do some rap."
01:44:34;01:44:35;"Yeah."
01:44:48;01:44:49;"Sucks."
01:44:49;01:44:50;"Whoa!"
01:44:50;01:44:51;"Sorry."
01:44:51;01:44:52;"Sucks."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"You think that song sucks?"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"So that's the first time you said one of these songs sucks."
01:44:56;01:44:57;"No."
01:44:57;01:44:58;"Or you thought they were sucks?"
01:44:58;01:44:59;"I don't know."
01:44:59;01:45:00;"Where is it going?"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"Let's keep listening."
01:45:02;01:45:03;"Or do you like that kind of illusion,"
01:45:03;01:45:05;"that kind of '50s music that..."
01:45:05;01:45:06;"It's very doo-wop."
01:45:09;01:45:11;"Yeah, Dion or something."
01:45:13;01:45:14;"From 6/8?"
01:45:14;01:45:15;"You don't hear that on the radio a lot?"
01:45:22;01:45:24;"Well, let's see where he goes with it."
01:45:24;01:45:25;"We need a big chorus, Ed."
01:45:25;01:45:26;"Come on."
01:45:32;01:45:34;"Rip that off."
01:45:34;01:45:35;"From Briss?"
01:45:35;01:45:36;"Yeah."
01:45:36;01:45:38;"I'm a little closer."
01:45:39;01:45:40;"Hey, Ed."
01:45:40;01:45:41;"I heard your music, man."
01:45:41;01:45:42;"[Laughter]"
01:45:42;01:45:43;"Took one of my lyrics."
01:45:43;01:45:45;"Took one of my song titles."
01:46:01;01:46:02;"Strings come in."
01:46:02;01:46:06;"Another organic, old-time instrument."
01:46:06;01:46:09;"Give me ""Whiter Shade of Pale,"" you know?"
01:46:09;01:46:10;"Give me..."
01:46:10;01:46:12;"No, but ""Whiter Shade of Pale,"""
01:46:12;01:46:13;"that's from the '60s, man."
01:46:13;01:46:14;"The kids need their version."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"That's fine."
01:46:15;01:46:16;"I'm not very impressed with that,"
01:46:16;01:46:17;"to be honest with you."
01:46:17;01:46:18;"I'm sorry."
01:46:18;01:46:19;"I think it's very basic."

01:52:25;01:52:27;"So, coming-- It's time for number one."
01:52:27;01:52:31;"So, I didn't know that, Tim,"
01:52:31;01:52:33;"that you were-- you're just a rock guy."
01:52:33;01:52:34;"Nothing wrong with that."
01:52:34;01:52:35;"I'm not a rock guy."
01:52:35;01:52:36;"You're a rock guy."
01:52:36;01:52:39;"I'm not-- I'm a-- I'm all kinds of guy, but..."
01:52:39;01:52:40;"Just not hip-hop?"
01:52:40;01:52:41;"Not hip-hop."
01:52:41;01:52:42;"Or pop?"
01:52:42;01:52:43;"Not pop."
01:52:43;01:52:44;"No."
01:52:44;01:52:45;"Not Ed Sheeran?"
01:52:45;01:52:46;"I like jazz."
01:52:46;01:52:47;"I like, uh..."
01:52:47;01:52:48;"Yeah, I like all kinds of stuff,"
01:52:48;01:52:52;"but pop-- modern pop is a bit alien to me."
01:52:52;01:52:53;"Leaves you cold."
01:52:53;01:52:54;"OK."
01:52:54;01:52:56;"Well, you might be happy to know"
01:52:56;01:52:58;"that ""Against All Odds"" in 2017--"
01:52:58;01:53:01;"The song from Phil Collins, ""Against All Odds""?"
01:53:01;01:53:02;"Is number one."
01:53:02;01:53:03;"Again."
01:53:03;01:53:05;"It was in a Papa John's commercial."
01:53:05;01:53:06;"[laughter]"
01:53:06;01:53:08;"And it's racing up the charts."
01:53:08;01:53:10;"No, the number one song right now on iTunes"
01:53:10;01:53:12;"is actually by a rock band."
01:53:12;01:53:13;"Really?"
01:53:13;01:53:14;"An alternative rock band."
01:53:14;01:53:15;"It's an American band?"
01:53:15;01:53:16;"An American band."
01:53:16;01:53:17;"They're from Nevada."
01:53:17;01:53:18;"Jeez."
01:53:18;01:53:20;"And they've been around for a while,"
01:53:20;01:53:21;"or are they pretty new?"
01:53:21;01:53:22;"They're relatively new."
01:53:22;01:53:24;"I think this might be their second or third album."
01:53:24;01:53:26;"The band's called Imagine Dragons."
01:53:26;01:53:27;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:53:27;01:53:28;"You know them?"
01:53:28;01:53:29;"Are they considered a rock band?"
01:53:29;01:53:30;"Seems like--"
01:53:30;01:53:32;"Well, they are-- their music has, obviously,"
01:53:32;01:53:34;"a lot of, like, influence from modern pop production,"
01:53:34;01:53:37;"but the delivery and the tone, I think you could say,"
01:53:37;01:53:40;"is somewhere in the tradition of alternative rock."
01:53:40;01:53:42;"♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪"
01:53:42;01:53:43;"Yes."

01:53:51;01:53:53;"they've really had a lot of hits recently,"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"so this is their big song right now."
01:53:55;01:53:59;"Number one on the charts, 2017, ""Thunder."""

01:54:59;01:55:01;"in America, I guess."
01:55:01;01:55:03;"I have a slight theory."
01:55:03;01:55:06;"This really is, like, the 10th of this song"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"is kind of big enough for everybody."
01:55:08;01:55:10;"Like, this honestly doesn't sound that different"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"than, like, modern country."
01:55:12;01:55:13;"'Cause, you know, like, if you're listening"
01:55:13;01:55:15;"to modern country radio, and it's--"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"some of it, outside of a slight southern twang,"
01:55:17;01:55:19;"has nothing to do with traditional country."
01:55:19;01:55:22;"It has big pop drums and big hooks and stuff."
01:55:22;01:55:24;"So I think somebody who's into country could--"
01:55:24;01:55:26;"modern country could potentially, like,"
01:55:26;01:55:27;"imagine dragons."
01:55:27;01:55:28;"Somebody who's into rock could."
01:55:28;01:55:31;"Somebody who's into pop, somebody who's into hip-hop."
01:55:31;01:55:33;"It has, like, a big beat, a big hook."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"It's almost genre-less, I guess, in a way."
01:55:35;01:55:37;"- Where's the hook? I haven't heard it yet."
01:55:37;01:55:38;"- The hook was-- [imitates baby voice]"
01:55:38;01:55:39;"was the baby voice. - Uh-huh."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"- That's kind of EDM, too."
01:55:41;01:55:42;"- Yeah, it's a little EDM."
01:55:42;01:55:43;"- You get the idea."
