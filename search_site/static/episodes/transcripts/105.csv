00:00;00:03;">> Time Crisis back once again."
00:03;00:09;"On this episode, we dig deep on the relationship between the Trump family and Jam Bands."
00:09;00:14;"We also talk about Morrissey and his unusual merchandise."
00:14;00:20;"All that plus Beto, Bernie, and the top hits of 1972."
00:20;00:22;"This is a very special-"
00:22;00:26;">> Time Crisis with Ed's Rump King."
00:26;00:30;">> Peaceful World."
01:00;01:16;">> Time Crisis back once again."
01:16;01:20;">> Well, Jake, we find ourselves once again in the true time crisis."
01:20;01:24;"We banked an app because we both had to leave town."
01:24;01:26;"We both had to split."
01:26;01:29;"And then we came back again later to bank another app."
01:29;01:34;"But in the time that passed between the first banked app and this banked app that we're here to record,"
01:34;01:36;"some things changed in the world."
01:36;01:38;"So we're just going to give a heads up to the listeners."
01:38;01:42;"In this episode, we talk a lot about the Beto O'Rourke campaign."
01:42;01:44;">> This is very sensitive."
01:44;01:45;">> This is very sensitive."
01:45;01:50;"In this episode, we talked about the Beto O'Rourke campaign and some of the e-mails they were sending out."
01:50;01:54;"Since the time that we recorded it, Beto has ended his campaign."
01:54;01:56;"And look, as far as I'm concerned, it's a good thing."
01:56;01:57;">> It's a strong choice."
01:58;02:01;"And I have a feeling that now you've got a little more time to think,"
02:01;02:04;"and you'll figure out ways that you can help the eventual nominee."
02:04;02:07;"Or you say you're not going to run for Senate in Texas."
02:07;02:10;"That's cool, but I'm sure you can figure out all sorts of great things to do in Texas."
02:10;02:14;"But anyway, just when our listeners are listening to this episode,"
02:14;02:16;"and they hear us start to talk about the Beto campaign,"
02:16;02:20;"you've got to understand that at the time, it was a living, breathing campaign."
02:20;02:21;">> He was polling at 1%."
02:21;02:23;">> He was polling at 1%, but he was still in there."
02:23;02:24;">> Yeah, man."
02:24;02:25;">> And now he's gone."
02:25;02:28;">> Gone, he's gone."
02:28;02:30;">> So anyway, that was just a little bit of a heads up."
02:30;02:34;"And, you know, that's what happens with live streaming radio, live streaming banked-up radio."
02:34;02:35;"A true time crisis."
02:35;02:36;"So anyway, shout out to Beto O'Rourke."
02:36;02:38;"Strong choice, dropping out."
02:38;02:41;"I think you're in a way better position now to do some meaningful stuff."
02:41;02:42;">> Start a band, dude."
02:42;02:47;">> Yeah, my cousin Benji Sarlin, who works for NBC News, he's a political pundit,"
02:47;02:50;"he tweeted, ""In all seriousness, Beto should start a band."""
02:50;02:54;"But anyway, that's enough Beto talk from this moment."
02:54;03:00;"Now we're going to return to the beginning of the time crisis episode that was supposed to air"
03:00;03:03;"in an alternate universe where Beto's campaign had not ended yet."
03:03;03:05;">> Time Crisis."
03:05;03:08;">> This is a real time crisis original flavor."
03:08;03:09;">> Original lineup."
03:09;03:13;">> Just the core crew."
03:13;03:14;"No fancy guests."
03:14;03:15;">> No."
03:15;03:16;">> No even friends of the show."
03:16;03:17;"Just the boys."
03:17;03:20;">> Starting lineup."
03:20;03:21;">> For the first time."
03:21;03:23;"Almost in two months."
03:23;03:24;">> Yeah."
03:24;03:25;"It feels great."
03:25;03:26;">> Yeah."
03:26;03:30;"Just don't have to do any research about, you don't have to look at anybody's Wikipedia page."
03:30;03:32;"Just fly by the seat of our pants."
03:32;03:34;"Well, what should we talk about?"
03:34;03:37;"By this point, I think I'm probably on tour in Europe."
03:37;03:38;">> Right."
03:38;03:39;">> Because you're going to Europe too."
03:39;03:40;">> Yeah."
03:40;03:41;">> We're almost going to cross over."
03:41;03:43;">> I'm going for personal reasons."
03:43;03:44;">> Yeah."
03:44;03:45;">> Pleasure, not business."
03:45;03:46;">> Is it a pleasure trip?"
03:46;03:47;">> Yeah, it's pleasure."
03:47;03:48;">> No business whatsoever?"
03:48;03:49;">> None."
03:49;03:51;">> When you come back to the U.S., what was the purpose of your trip?"
03:51;03:52;"Pleasure, sir."
03:52;03:53;">> Pure pleasure."
03:54;03:58;">> Pleasure is such a funny word for that context."
03:58;04:01;"It's not like recreation or vacation."
04:01;04:02;"Pleasure is very sensual."
04:02;04:04;">> Yeah, it sounds like sex tourism."
04:04;04:07;"Traveling for pleasure is a euphemism for sex tourism."
04:07;04:08;">> Delectable cuisine."
04:08;04:15;">> Oh, man, that must be such a weird job being like a customs agent or a homeland security dude on the way back."
04:15;04:19;"Because on the one hand, you got all these stressed out, tired people."
04:19;04:24;"But then you probably also have the occasional person who's just really jazzed on the trip they just took."
04:24;04:25;">> I'm feeling great, man."
04:25;04:28;">> I've definitely seen people like chopping it up before."
04:28;04:30;">> Yeah, that seems like a tough nut to crack, though."
04:30;04:35;">> Well, I've just seen people be like -- yeah, like get back, be like, ""Oh, man."
04:35;04:36;"Oh, yeah, how was it over there?"
04:36;04:37;"Yeah, I don't know."
04:37;04:39;"I've seen -- it hasn't happened to me very often."
04:39;04:40;">> I'm going to try."
04:40;04:42;">> To chop it up with the agent."
04:42;04:43;">> Yeah."
04:43;04:44;">> When also you talk to the people on the other side."
04:44;04:45;">> Yeah."
04:45;04:46;">> When you get there."
04:46;04:47;"So you'll be traveling."
04:47;04:49;"When's the last time you were in Europe?"
04:49;04:50;"Oh, yeah, it was Italy?"
04:50;04:51;">> Well, yeah, look at me."
04:51;04:53;">> We talked about this on the show."
04:53;04:55;">> Globetrotter over here."
04:55;05:00;"I hadn't been to Europe in about like, I don't know, like 15 or 18 years."
05:00;05:02;"And then I went last year to Italy."
05:02;05:03;">> I feel like we talked about that in that episode."
05:03;05:05;"That was basically your honeymoon."
05:05;05:06;">> Yep."
05:06;05:07;">> You were cycling around Italy."
05:07;05:09;">> Yes, for part of the trip."
05:09;05:10;"And Hannah and I both fell."
05:10;05:11;">> Crazy."
05:11;05:13;">> I have a small scar on my knee."
05:13;05:14;">> Really?"
05:14;05:15;">> Oh, yeah."
05:15;05:19;">> I guess your matching scars are kind of like matching tattoos that some married couples get."
05:19;05:20;">> Love that."
05:20;05:22;">> Always remember."
05:22;05:26;"Yeah, I feel like we talked about that last time that you hadn't -- not only had you not been to Europe,"
05:26;05:29;"you hadn't, like, left the country in a really long time."
05:29;05:31;"Had you not left the country in a decade or am I forgetting something?"
05:31;05:32;">> Well --"
05:32;05:34;">> Or you'd been down Mexico way, something like that?"
05:34;05:37;">> No, I haven't been -- oh, no, I went there a few years ago."
05:37;05:38;"You know what it was?"
05:38;05:42;"When we started the show back in 2015, I think, yeah."
05:42;05:43;">> Sounds right."
05:43;05:50;">> I went to China in 2015, and that was the first time I had been out of the country in about 14 years."
05:50;05:52;">> And that was for a business trip."
05:52;05:53;">> That was business."
05:53;05:55;">> That was painterly business."
05:55;05:56;">> Exhibition in Beijing."
05:56;05:58;"Sounds very fancy."
05:58;06:00;">> Sir, what were you doing over there in China?"
06:00;06:02;"What were you doing down China way?"
06:02;06:04;">> Painter's business, sir."
06:04;06:05;">> All right."
06:05;06:06;"Fine art?"
06:06;06:11;">> I was there for painting business, and I'll tell you, brother, business is a-boomin'."
06:11;06:40;"[ Music ]"
06:40;06:50;"[ Music ]"
06:50;07:11;"[ Music ]"
07:11;07:13;">> So since 2015, I've really been a globetrotter."
07:13;07:18;"I went to Mexico once, Italy, Canada quite a few times this past year."
07:18;07:19;">> Oh, yeah, Calgary."
07:19;07:20;">> Spain."
07:20;07:21;">> So that's pretty hardcore."
07:21;07:23;"For 14 years, you were all American."
07:23;07:28;"You were bleeding red, white, and blue, not leaving our country, and now you're all over the place."
07:28;07:30;"Did the travel bug bite you?"
07:30;07:31;">> Hmm, I'm not sure about that."
07:31;07:33;"I think it's more circumstantial."
07:33;07:37;"Combination of business and my wife's interests."
07:37;07:39;"[ Laughter ]"
07:39;07:41;">> I'm here with the wife."
07:41;07:43;"[ Laughter ]"
07:43;07:46;"Yeah, it's too bad that we're not going to link up."
07:46;07:48;"Got a couple big shows in London."
07:48;07:49;">> Right."
07:49;07:52;">> I actually had a thought recently when I was thinking about set list."
07:52;07:59;"I don't think we should actually do this, but I think the next time to really bust out Mountain Brews,"
07:59;08:04;"which currently Vampire Wiggins is done once, Night 2 at Red Rocks, I was thinking, like, okay,"
08:04;08:10;"I definitely want to do it a lot when we do our mountain run with Twiddle next year when we're, you know, in Boise and Missoula."
08:10;08:15;"And it's not technically mountain time, but we could throw in Bend, Oregon, because it's part of the same run."
08:15;08:17;"It feels appropriate."
08:17;08:22;"But then I don't know if it would go down well, but I had this thought, like, if we dropped it in one, like, super random place,"
08:22;08:24;"and I was just thinking, like, Paris."
08:24;08:26;">> I would encourage it."
08:26;08:29;">> I guess I'd have to just really memorize the whole speech in French."
08:29;08:32;"Madame, madame et messieurs."
08:32;08:34;"Time in French is temps."
08:34;08:39;"T-E-M-P-S, temps de montagne, I think."
08:39;08:41;"Ah, my accent is so terrible now."
08:41;08:43;"I studied it for five years."
08:43;08:47;"Montagne, brew, beer is beer, I think."
08:47;08:48;">> Brew."
08:49;08:51;"Oh, yeah, yeah, brew de montagne."
08:51;08:53;"Yeah, I wouldn't be talking about mountain time."
08:53;08:59;"I learned one sentence in Spanish to drop in Monterrey when we were down there."
08:59;09:00;"Some people helped me out."
09:00;09:07;"Because I thought it was worth noting that the first time VW ever came to Mexico, we played in Monterrey."
09:07;09:11;"So I thought it was, like, cool to let, like, when we were playing in that city again, to let everybody know,"
09:11;09:14;"like, the first time we came to this great country, we played in Monterrey."
09:14;09:15;">> Man, I already forgot it."
09:15;09:19;"But it was, like, la primera vez que -- I already forgot it."
09:19;09:20;">> The first time --"
09:20;09:22;">> Do you speak -- how's your Spanish?"
09:22;09:23;">> How's your Spanish?"
09:23;09:24;">> Weak."
09:24;09:25;">> Weak?"
09:25;09:26;">> But I did take it for years."
09:26;09:27;">> Okay."
09:27;09:28;"La primera -- is it primera?"
09:28;09:34;"La primera vez que toqué en México fue Monterrey."
09:34;09:36;">> The first time we played in Mexico, we went to Monterrey."
09:36;09:37;">> Yeah."
09:37;09:38;">> Love it."
09:38;09:40;">> And then this comedian that I met down there --"
09:40;09:41;">> Toque, dude."
09:41;09:49;">> La primera vez que toqué en Mexico fue Monterrey."
09:49;09:51;">> Fue Monterrey, dude."
09:51;09:53;">> Que toque."
09:53;09:54;"Que toque is a good --"
09:54;09:56;">> Yo tengo hombre."
09:56;09:58;">> Yeah, I don't know how good my pronunciation is."
09:58;10:02;"I mean, I do love how people from there, they rolled R on Monterrey."
10:02;10:03;"Monterrey."
10:03;10:07;"I'm sure that sounds really awkward when I do it, but I try because I think it sounds cool."
10:07;10:12;"And then I was talking to a bunch of people, including this Mexican comedian named Richie O'Farrell."
10:12;10:16;"We did kind of like an episode of like a YouTube series that he does."
10:16;10:19;"He took me to like a dope old-school churro spot in Mexico City."
10:19;10:23;"But he was also at the festival in Monterrey, and I was like, he's from Mexico City, but I was just asking him generally,"
10:23;10:25;"like, is there anything good to say to get the crowd from you?"
10:25;10:28;"He's like, well, up here, you could say, ""Sacen la carnita asada."""
10:28;10:29;"And I was like, what does that mean?"
10:29;10:31;"I think it basically means like bring out the meat."
10:31;10:33;"Bring out the carne asada."
10:33;10:34;">> Bring out the meat."
10:34;10:36;">> Yeah, sacen."
10:36;10:37;"I don't even know how it's spelled."
10:37;10:38;"Maybe S-A-Q."
10:38;10:40;"Everybody's reached the limit of their Spanish here."
10:40;10:41;">> Sacar."
10:41;10:42;"I remember the verb, sacar."
10:42;10:43;"I just don't."
10:43;10:45;">> Sacar means to."
10:45;10:46;">> Bring, maybe?"
10:46;10:47;">> Maybe it's to bring."
10:47;10:49;"Maybe it just meant, it means bring out the carne asada."
10:49;10:50;">> Bring out the meat."
10:50;10:52;">> I think it just means a little bit like let's get this party started."
10:52;10:53;">> Right."
10:53;10:54;">> You know?"
10:54;10:55;">> That's a cool expression."
10:55;10:56;">> But he was very clear about one thing."
10:56;10:58;"He said, don't say this in Mexico City."
10:58;11:00;"This is a Monterrey thing."
11:00;11:02;"Sacen la carnita asada."
11:02;11:06;"And then when I was down in Mexico, people offered some more complicated versions of"
11:06;11:08;"what might play in Mexico City."
11:08;11:10;"Something more about like tacos or something."
11:10;11:13;"Oh, and then the other thing everybody told me to say, which I think just means like we"
11:13;11:17;"love you guys, which is something I would say in English at a show, so I was happy to"
11:17;11:20;"learn it, is los amo, cabrones."
11:20;11:21;">> Tight, man."
11:21;11:23;"You're like Beto O'Rourke up there, man."
11:23;11:26;">> Yeah, basically."
11:26;11:28;"Beto O'Rourke of indie."
11:28;11:33;"[ Music ]"
12:33;12:37;">> You know, we haven't talked politics in a long time in this show."
12:37;12:39;"Look, Beto seems like a nice guy."
12:39;12:41;"And we've talked about his emails before on the show, right?"
12:41;12:45;"We talked about his kind of infamous short story email that he just sent out that was"
12:45;12:49;"just like out of nowhere, just like, the kids are watching Last of the Mohicans."
12:49;12:51;"My coffee's bitter, but it's good."
12:51;12:55;"And just like dropping the names of everybody in his family as if we already know who they"
12:55;12:56;"are."
12:56;12:57;">> And like the dogs."
12:57;13:00;">> And the boy and an Artemis are running around outside."
13:00;13:04;">> So I've always been interested in his emails, so I don't mean to beat up on the guy, but"
13:04;13:09;"A, I gave money to his campaign for Senate, like a lot of people."
13:09;13:10;">> Yep."
13:10;13:15;">> I'm a classic coastal leftist who wanted to send some of my coastal money deep into"
13:15;13:20;"the heart of Texas to make Ted Cruz lose."
13:20;13:25;"I think most people could agree, Ted Cruz is not good for America."
13:25;13:27;"Beto seemed like a chill dude."
13:27;13:32;"I was charmed by the fact that he used to be in a band with some of the At The Drive-In"
13:32;13:33;"guys."
13:33;13:37;"And so I gave money to it, but there was something about just transferring from supporting somebody's"
13:37;13:39;"Senate campaign to the presidential campaign."
13:39;13:40;"It just snuck up on me."
13:40;13:43;"I'm like, I'm used to getting emails from his campaign, then suddenly it's about running"
13:43;13:44;"for president."
13:44;13:47;"And I'm just like, yeah, I wasn't consulted on this, man."
13:47;13:48;">> Bait and switch."
13:48;13:50;">> I'm not gonna give money to your presidential campaign."
13:50;13:52;"I don't see the point."
13:52;13:56;"But his presidential campaign emails, they've just gotten progressively darker."
13:56;13:58;">> I love that you still read them."
13:58;13:59;">> Well, now I have this interest."
13:59;14:00;">> Yeah."
14:00;14:04;">> To the Beto campaign's credit, and to a lot of the campaigns, they know how to get"
14:04;14:05;"you to click."
14:05;14:06;"In fact, I got one recently."
14:06;14:10;"I can't even remember everybody that I gave money to recently, but there's a guy running"
14:10;14:13;"against a Republican in California."
14:13;14:20;"Okay, his name's Amar Kampa Najjar, and he's running to defeat Republican Duncan Hunter,"
14:20;14:22;"who was recently indicted for fraud."
14:22;14:26;"So look, I'm sure I read something that I was like, man, we gotta help this dude, Amar"
14:26;14:28;"Kampa Najjar, beat Duncan Hunter."
14:28;14:33;"So I gave some money, and then they're always asking for more money, which that's how it"
14:33;14:34;"works."
14:34;14:35;"They need it."
14:35;14:36;"I don't knock them."
14:36;14:38;"But the last email I got, and this was effective."
14:38;14:40;"It made me just kick in a little more money."
14:40;14:44;"The last email I got from the Amar Kampa Najjar campaign just said, goodbye, Ezra."
14:44;14:45;">> Damn."
14:45;14:47;">> I was like, what's this one about?"
14:47;14:50;"And then I thought, is this campaign ending?"
14:50;14:52;"Did I do something to offend him?"
14:52;14:56;"And then I click on it, and it's just like, Ezra, our race reached a boiling point."
14:56;14:57;"Like, throw down."
14:57;14:58;"Well, it says donation."
14:58;15:00;">> Midnight deadline tonight."
15:00;15:02;">> Yeah, but I was just like, goodbye, Ezra."
15:02;15:03;">> Yeah, that's strong."
15:03;15:05;">> It's also funny when they use your name and stuff."
15:05;15:09;"So anyway, Beto, this is one that I sent to the thread, because I was like, this one's"
15:09;15:10;"just hilarious."
15:10;15:15;"And I think part of my issue, why I'm okay with a little gentle ribbing towards Beto,"
15:15;15:20;"not because I think he's a bad guy, but because I don't know why so many people are running."
15:20;15:24;"Look, we could narrow it down to four people, and you'd have basically your bases covered."
15:24;15:25;"And there's something about Beto."
15:25;15:29;"There's a part of me that's a little bit annoyed that he's not using all that goodwill to really"
15:29;15:30;"change things in Texas."
15:30;15:32;"This presidential run seems pointless."
15:32;15:36;"So there's a couple emails that I got from him recently, and I'm sure we have some listeners"
15:36;15:38;"who probably also have contributed money to Beto."
15:38;15:42;"Maybe they're even Team Beto, but they could still admit these are kind of funny emails"
15:42;15:43;"to get."
15:43;15:46;"So one was subject line, ""Game-changing news from NBC."""
15:46;15:49;"I'm like, all right."
15:49;15:52;"You have my curiosity."
15:52;15:53;"So I click."
15:53;15:54;"What is this game-changing news?"
15:54;15:59;"Is it going to say, you know, ""Turns out Beto is actually polling higher than Joe Biden."""
15:59;16:00;"You know, ""Turns out,"" like blah, blah."
16:00;16:01;"And this is what it said."
16:01;16:04;"""Ezra, we wanted to make sure you saw this."""
16:04;16:06;"And then there's a quote from NBC News."
16:06;16:11;"""Only 9% of all Democratic respondents say their minds are definitely made up."""
16:11;16:13;"And it goes on to say, ""This is game-changing news."
16:13;16:17;"It means the race is absolutely wide open."""
16:17;16:21;"And just to break this down for a second, the first thing I thought of was ""Dumb and"
16:21;16:23;"Dumber,"" where I believe -- what's the dialogue?"
16:23;16:28;"Jim Carrey, he's asking a woman, ""What's the chance you would ever, like, go out with me?"""
16:28;16:29;"And she says, ""I don't know, one in a million."""
16:29;16:32;"And he goes, ""So you're saying there's a chance."""
16:32;16:35;"It's an iconic line of '90s cinema."
16:35;16:38;"I don't know how that movie holds up for our younger listeners, but, you know, that was"
16:38;16:39;"a big movie."
16:39;16:40;"It's a great line."
16:40;16:43;"That was kind of like ""Joker"" for, you know, in the '90s."
16:43;16:46;"But, yeah, so you're saying there's a chance."
16:46;16:50;"Just like, you know, it's a great line because it sums up the epitome of somebody who just"
16:50;16:54;"doesn't get it, who looks for the bright side even when there truly is no bright side."
16:54;16:57;"So when I see this, it's not -- the game-changing news was not ""Beto has a chance."""
16:57;17:00;"It basically was they asked a bunch of Democrats, ""Who do you want to vote for?"""
17:00;17:02;"And almost everybody said, ""Not Beto."""
17:02;17:05;"And then the second question was, ""But is your mind definitely made up?"""
17:05;17:08;"And 91% of people said, ""I guess not."""
17:08;17:11;"And then Beto's team saw this and goes, ""So you're saying there's a chance."""
17:11;17:13;"I just love that, too."
17:13;17:15;"Just like we're polling at 1%."
17:15;17:23;"We clearly don't seem to be offering anything that Bernie, Warren, Biden, Kamala, Andrew"
17:23;17:24;"Yang, everybody's polling better."
17:24;17:26;"Tom Steyer, you know, every --"
17:26;17:29;"Plus, we're on stage in Ohio talking about confiscating guns."
17:29;17:34;"I mean, look, if that fired up the base, it'd be one thing, but I don't think it particularly did."
17:34;17:37;"So I saw this and I was like, ""What is going on over there, man?"""
17:37;17:41;"And then the next email that the campaign sent out, subject line, ""Amy Klobuchar."""
17:41;17:42;"Like, that's it."
17:42;17:44;"That's a sick subject line."
17:44;17:46;"Yeah, just somebody else who's running for president."
17:46;17:48;"And then this is the opening."
17:48;17:53;"""Ezra, this morning, Amy Klobuchar locked down her final requirement and officially"
17:53;17:57;"qualified for the November Democratic debate."""
17:57;17:59;"Amy effing Klobuchar."
17:59;18:02;"And then in bold, ""Beto still hasn't qualified."""
18:02;18:04;"[laughs]"
18:04;18:05;"Oh, man."
18:05;18:08;"You know, it's one thing when people are like, ""Yeah, we're trying to hit our SEC,"
18:08;18:11;"what is it, our filing deadline, and blah, blah, blah."""
18:11;18:16;"It's another thing where somebody -- the vibe of just like, ""Amy Klobuchar, are you f***ing kidding me?"""
18:16;18:19;"So I found that one kind of, like, sad."
18:19;18:21;"And this is the one that the team sent out today."
18:21;18:23;"This is the subject line."
18:23;18:25;"""Even Tom Steyer."""
18:25;18:26;"Oh, my God."
18:26;18:28;"Yeah, it's like, ""Even Tom Steyer."""
18:28;18:30;"And then, ""Beto"" -- open it."
18:30;18:31;"""Take a look at this, Ezra."
18:31;18:37;"Kate Silver's FiveThirtyEight website is reporting that nine candidates have officially made the November Democratic debate."
18:37;18:41;"Here is who will be on the debate stage when millions tune in and who has some more work to do."""
18:41;18:47;"And then it says, ""Joe Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, Buttigieg, Tom Steyer, Andrew Yang, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar."""
18:47;18:49;"And there's a check next to each of their names."
18:49;18:51;"And then it says, ""Beto O'Rourke."""
18:51;18:52;"Nothing."
18:52;18:54;"Rough stuff."
18:54;18:58;"I just feel like a lot of people have this feeling like, ""Beto, like, you're our guy in Texas, man."
18:58;18:59;"Make a difference down there."""
18:59;19:00;"Yeah."
19:00;19:04;"And then they keep sending out these emails that are just like, ""It's kind of seeming like nobody wants me to be president."""
19:04;19:06;"Yeah, is he trying to germ up sympathy?"
19:06;19:07;"I guess."
19:07;19:12;"That's just not the way to do -- I mean, that's not the right set of emotions that you look for in a candidate."
19:12;19:14;"Like, ""I feel sorry for this guy."""
19:14;19:16;"Yeah, I mean, but you're so right."
19:16;19:18;"I'm going to go ahead and give him some money because I just feel bad for the dude."
19:18;19:22;"But that vibe of, ""Amy f---ing Klobuchar."""
19:22;19:24;"""Even Tom Steyer."""
19:24;19:25;"""Even Tom Steyer."""
19:25;19:26;"You know what that makes me think of?"
19:26;19:28;"Tom Steyer's real deep."
19:28;19:30;"That is so deep."
19:30;19:31;"I can understand him."
19:31;19:32;"Who is like --"
19:32;19:38;"That sounds like something you say to your campaign manager when you're throwing a Jimmy John's sandwich against the wall."
19:38;19:40;"Flipping a folding table."
19:40;19:48;"You're at a truck stop in Iowa, just throwing a Jimmy John's down on the ground and going, ""Even Tom Steyer?"""
19:48;19:50;"I don't know why you bring that out to everyone."
19:50;19:53;"Yeah, it kind of makes me think of that Tom Petty song."
19:53;19:56;"""Even the losers."""
19:56;19:58;"""Even Tom Steyer."""
19:58;20:01;"""Even Tom Steyer gets lucky sometimes."""
20:01;20:08;"Well, it was nearly summer, we sat under a roof"
20:08;20:16;"Yeah, we smoked cigarettes and we stared at the moon"
20:16;20:22;"And I showed you stars you never could see"
20:22;20:28;"Baby, it couldn't have been that easy to forget about me"
20:28;20:35;"Spent a time when nothing really seemed real"
20:35;20:42;"Yeah, you could kiss like fire when you made me feel"
20:42;20:48;"Like every word you said was meant to be"
20:48;20:53;"No, it couldn't have been that easy to forget about me"
20:53;21:01;"Baby, even the losers get lucky sometimes"
21:01;21:08;"Even the losers keep a little bit of pride"
21:08;21:11;"They get lucky sometimes"
21:11;21:14;"Time Crisis on Beat One"
21:14;21:17;"But look, I don't mean to rag on Beto too much."
21:17;21:21;"I mean, I can imagine once you start running for president, a new kind of logic takes over."
21:21;21:24;"And that's what you're doing. You're goal-oriented."
21:24;21:28;"And your goal is to become president and until your campaign officially ends,"
21:28;21:33;"you're going to tackle it with zest and whatever it takes."
21:33;21:37;"But one thing I do want to say, just thinking about what's been going on lately,"
21:37;21:40;"and you know, we talked a lot about politics in the last election"
21:40;21:46;"and then didn't always necessarily feel like people needed their horrifying Trump news from us."
21:46;21:48;"But now that we're back in campaign season,"
21:48;21:49;"Jesus Christ."
21:49;21:51;"I do want to say, I like Bernie, man."
21:51;21:54;"I think actually we should go do some campaigning for Bernie."
21:54;21:55;"Get back out there."
21:55;21:56;"TCVW."
21:56;21:58;"We did it last time."
21:58;21:59;"Yeah, man."
21:59;22:00;"Remember in Iowa? We did a whole episode."
22:00;22:01;"Of course."
22:01;22:02;"Are you down to get back out there?"
22:02;22:03;"Yeah."
22:03;22:05;"Maybe do a mountain bruise?"
22:05;22:08;"Thank you, Jake, and mountain bruise."
22:08;22:13;"In the great state of Vermont, I too have partaken in a few mountain bruises in my day."
22:13;22:15;"What's Vermont called? The Green Mountain State?"
22:15;22:16;"It's the Green Mountain State."
22:16;22:20;"Jake, I hope some of those mountain bruises are Green Mountain Bruce."
22:20;22:26;"I'm referring, of course, to both the Green New Deal and the great state of Vermont."
22:26;22:28;"Green Mountain Bruce."
22:28;22:32;"Maybe we got to do a Green Mountain Bruce remix for the Bernie campaign."
22:32;22:33;"Should we have him sing?"
22:33;22:35;"Green Mountain Bruce."
22:35;22:36;"Green Mountain Bruce."
22:36;22:38;"Green Mountain Bruce."
22:38;22:40;"Sweet as morning dew."
22:40;22:42;"We got to play a little bit of his This Land is Your Land."
22:42;22:48;"For people who don't remember, during the last campaign, there was an uncovered album from Bernie from the '80s,"
22:48;22:54;"which I believe he did for charity or something, where he was reading, essentially talking over reggae."
22:54;22:57;"And one of them was a reggae version of This Land is Your Land."
22:57;23:00;"He was like, ""As I went walking these""--what is it? Crooked highways?"
23:00;23:01;"It rules."
23:01;23:02;"Yeah, it's cool."
23:02;23:07;"I saw above me that endless skyway."
23:07;23:12;"I saw below me that golden valley."
23:12;23:17;"This land was made for you and me."
23:17;23:22;"And look, I'm not going to go to the mat and say that there's anything wrong with Elizabeth Warren."
23:22;23:24;"She's saying all the right things."
23:24;23:31;"The most appreciable difference between her and Bernie is that Bernie just has a longer record as a public servant saying the exact same thing."
23:31;23:36;"And this is my personal take, is that there's a lot of reasons to be excited about her as well."
23:36;23:38;"I love the fact that they're on the same team."
23:38;23:46;"It's so clear when you watch the debates that they're two people who respect each other and have more in common with each other than some of the sellouts up there."
23:46;23:51;"But, you know, the reason that I support Bernie is just we live in such a nightmare world."
23:51;23:59;"Things need to be shaken up in such a big way, and the Democrats need to come correct with somebody who's just--maybe is a little bit intractable."
23:59;24:09;"Maybe is an ornery old person, and if you had to bet on who's going to be a little bit more hardcore about the agenda, Bernie is a pretty good bet compared to Warren."
24:09;24:17;"It doesn't mean they don't believe the same things, but again, just Bernie has this long record, and that's why it makes sense to call him a once-in-a-generation
politician."
24:17;24:28;"Not because he's saying things that no other politician is saying, just because he's the only politician saying it who has a decades-long career as a politician and
has been saying the same things over and over again."
24:28;24:33;"I like the fact that he's still an independent. I just think, why not?"
24:33;24:42;"So many groups of people in this country have just been f*cked over, over and over again by certainly the Republicans and even the occasional smooth-talking Democrat."
24:42;24:49;"So let's get that ornery person in there just to go lay the--why not try it? That's the thing, you know?"
24:49;24:55;"Elizabeth Warren has a slightly higher percentage chance of being in the classical Democrat mold than Bernie does. You know what I mean?"
24:55;24:58;"Yeah, I feel like we've tried every stripe of right-winger."
24:58;25:00;"Let's try a real lefty."
25:00;25:01;"Yeah, let's give that a shot."
25:01;25:04;"Let's try it, you know? And the fact that people really like him."
25:04;25:14;"And I also kind of feel a little bit like, look, I recognize we're sitting here, we're coastal elites, sitting here at the Apple studio in Southern California."
25:14;25:22;"But when you actually look at the math and stuff and you see that difficult jobs that a lot of people in this country have--teachers, fast food workers, truck drivers,
nurses--"
25:22;25:29;"and you look at the rates in which those people in those professions contribute to Bernie versus anybody else, it's like five or six times."
25:29;25:30;"That's amazing."
25:30;25:33;"And so there's a part of me that kind of feels like it's not just about what I want."
25:33;25:37;"That gives me a feeling that I should be supporting the working people in this world."
25:37;25:41;"I haven't had to worry about health insurance in 14 years."
25:41;25:45;"And sometimes I talk to people who are just like, ""Oh, Bernie, he says the same things over and over again."""
25:45;25:52;"But then you realize health insurance and health-related issues are a literal nightmare for so many of our fellow citizens."
25:52;25:56;"Again, let's just try. Try the guy who's hardcore."
25:56;26:02;"Try the guy who's like, ""No, f*** that. Medicare for all. Not budging."" Try it."
26:02;26:11;"Because it seems like, actually, despite what some of the media says, it does seem like that's what a lot of people in this country want, is true Medicare for all."
26:11;26:16;"Yeah, it's beyond screwed up that the health insurance industry is so profitable."
26:16;26:29;"One thing that does concern me, if we're just going straight real-deal politics, is this talking point of, if he gets the nomination, the big argument against him is
he's going to be taking away insurance from 150 million people."
26:29;26:36;"And even though the current status quo sucks, that's going to be such an insane change."
26:36;26:41;"Or, if you're casting it negatively, a disruption."
26:41;26:49;"That I worry that even though it's the right thing to do, that people aren't going to, I don't know, get the message on that."
26:49;26:52;"It's just like, that's the only thing that gives me a little pause."
26:52;26:56;"They're going to be coming hard for him, but again, I feel like, why not try?"
26:56;27:01;"If people are suffering to such a high extent, then why not try? That's how I feel."
27:01;27:05;"Well, I guess because Trump could get re-elected again."
27:05;27:07;"Oh, you mean if he loses because of that?"
27:07;27:09;"Yeah, I mean, I think that's a possibility."
27:09;27:11;"Well, look, we've just had Trump for four years."
27:11;27:17;"That's the thing that gives me, I mean, I think, like I said, I think Medicare for All is the morally righteous position."
27:17;27:18;"Right."
27:18;27:21;"But it gives me pause that it might be..."
27:21;27:26;"Well, I think the best argument against that is that a centrist Democrat already lost to Trump."
27:26;27:27;"Oh, yeah."
27:27;27:31;"Fairly, and perhaps unfairly, Hillary Clinton, you know, she came damn close to winning."
27:31;27:32;"Yeah."
27:32;27:34;"She basically won, but not quite."
27:34;27:37;"I mean, the insane thing is, is that Trump will lose the popular vote."
27:37;27:38;"We already know that."
27:38;27:39;"Yeah, like no matter what."
27:39;27:40;"That's insane."
27:40;27:43;"I think whatever Democrat runs has a good chance of beating Trump."
27:43;27:44;"Yeah."
27:44;27:47;"And Bernie, according to the polls, Bernie actually has the best chance."
27:47;27:51;"Look, I would totally agree with you or agree with the argument."
27:51;27:52;"That's my concern."
27:52;27:58;"No, no, and I would be very concerned if everybody was kind of like, ""Okay, Bernie, you say the right things."
27:58;28:01;"You know, we're going to pay for college. We're going to pay for health insurance."""
28:01;28:06;"But when you actually put those ideas out there, when we go do a poll of Bernie versus Trump"
28:06;28:11;"as opposed to Biden, as opposed to anybody else, Trump trounces you, man."
28:11;28:14;"People don't like those ideas, but it doesn't seem to be the case."
28:14;28:16;"It actually seems like people are pretty into it."
28:16;28:18;"Love to pull up some polling numbers."
28:18;28:21;"Everything that I've seen, Bernie always beats Trump the most comfortably."
28:21;28:22;"Yeah."
28:22;28:24;"And also, I got to say, I think it was really sick that AOC and--"
28:24;28:26;"That was sick."
28:26;28:29;"Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib endorsed Bernie."
28:29;28:34;"And I just love seeing the two of them together because they're two people who are united by what they believe in."
28:34;28:37;"There was an interview that they did together where, you know, they're sitting in front of both of them,"
28:37;28:41;"and the journalist said to AOC, ""Why are you endorsing an old white guy?"""
28:41;28:47;"AOC gets the, like, kind of the goofiest, most condescending questions over and over again, and she never breaks."
28:47;28:51;"She's always like, ""The reason I endorse Bernie is because I agree with everything he said because he blah blah."""
28:51;28:56;"And then she goes on to say, ""And because together, we form the coalition that this country needs."""
28:56;29:02;"You know, I think she was also subtly saying, ""Me endorsing Bernie doesn't turn me into an old white man, you moron."""
29:02;29:04;"But she's so polite."
29:04;29:10;"And then you kind of realize, like, oh, yeah, like, Bernie and her, that's literal diversity."
29:10;29:11;"Right."
29:11;29:12;"They share the same set of values."
29:12;29:14;"They share the same set of values, but they're different people."
29:14;29:17;"They come from different places, Queens and Brooklyn."
29:17;29:20;"But they obviously have different life experiences."
29:20;29:22;"She's right, you know, about he's an old white man."
29:22;29:24;"He's had different privileges and stuff in his life."
29:24;29:28;"But what he recognizes is that they're united by what they believe in, and that's what needs to happen in this country."
29:28;29:32;"And if people are divided by racism or something, well, then f--- them."
29:32;29:35;"They're going to miss out on what truly is a necessary good thing."
29:35;29:37;"And he's the one that inspired her to get into politics."
29:37;29:38;"Yeah, it's a great story."
29:38;29:39;"Yeah."
29:39;29:41;"It's like Star Wars or something."
29:41;29:43;"He's the Obi-Wan Kenobi?"
29:43;29:44;"She's Rogue One."
29:44;29:46;"I don't even know what Rogue One is."
29:46;29:48;"I haven't seen any of them in a while."
29:48;29:49;"I think he's Yoda and she's Rogue One."
29:49;29:50;"Oh, he's Yoda."
29:50;29:52;"Seinfeld, you a Star Wars nerd?"
29:52;29:54;"I just saw the first new one."
29:54;29:56;"But wouldn't he be like Harrison Ford?"
29:56;29:58;"Maybe Bernie's Rogue One and she's a new hope."
29:58;29:59;"Rey."
29:59;30:00;"No, AOC."
30:00;30:01;"Yeah, AOC is Rey."
30:01;30:02;"No, she's a new hope."
30:02;30:04;"I don't think Rogue-- is Rogue One a character?"
30:04;30:06;"I think that's just the name of the film."
30:06;30:09;"I think if Bernie wins, he'll get the Rogue One as the plane, right?"
30:09;30:11;"And in honor to--"
30:11;30:13;"Some dude wins the presidency."
30:13;30:14;"Yeah."
30:14;30:18;"Some, like, Star Wars nerd changing the name from Air Force One to Rogue One."
30:18;30:25;"It feels like a new sort of high that we're looking up the Wikipedia for Star Wars."
30:25;30:26;"[laughter]"
30:26;30:28;"Oh, wait, it's a ship."
30:28;30:29;"I don't know."
30:29;30:40;"In honor of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I hereby, in the obvious resonance that our mentor-mentee relationship has with the Star Wars universe,"
30:40;30:43;"I am renaming Air Force One, Rogue One."
30:43;30:47;"AOC, you're the Rogue One to my Boba Fett."
30:47;30:52;"America's just like, ""Who did we vote for? What is Boba Fett?"""
30:52;30:54;"The tight thing is that Bernie--"
30:54;30:55;"So, you mean Yoda."
30:55;30:56;"Rogue One is a movie."
30:56;30:58;"Exactly, a Star Wars movie."
30:58;31:03;"The tight thing is that Bernie is so kind of checked out on pop culture."
31:03;31:04;"Oh, yeah."
31:04;31:05;"Oh, did you see that--"
31:05;31:06;"Thank you, Twiddle."
31:06;31:07;"Did you see that Ariana--"
31:07;31:08;"[laughter]"
31:08;31:10;"Did you see that Ariana Grande thing?"
31:10;31:11;"Oh, yeah."
31:11;31:12;"No, I didn't see this."
31:12;31:13;"That was definitely a Bernie intern."
31:13;31:14;"Oh, yeah."
31:14;31:15;"Ariana Grande tweeted--"
31:15;31:17;"Ariana Grande tweeted--"
31:17;31:18;"What is it?"
31:18;31:19;"Is she down with Bernie?"
31:19;31:20;"It kind of seemed like it."
31:20;31:21;"Interesting."
31:21;31:22;"She wasn't not down with him."
31:22;31:24;"Isn't Cardi down with Bernie?"
31:24;31:25;"Oh, Cardi's really down with Bernie."
31:25;31:26;"She's done a lot to support the campaign."
31:26;31:27;"That's cool."
31:27;31:28;"She sat down for an interview with him."
31:28;31:31;"Ariana tweeted, ""Baby, how you feeling?"""
31:31;31:36;"And Bernie Sanders quote tweeted it with, ""Ready to fight for Medicare for all."""
31:36;31:38;"And then she followed up when she saw that like, ""Oh, my God."""
31:38;31:39;"That's right."
31:39;31:40;"Tight."
31:40;31:41;"Very elegant."
31:41;31:44;"660,000 likes on that Bernie Sanders retweet."
31:44;31:45;"I retweeted it."
31:45;31:50;"Look, it's a tiny bit corny, but corny times call for corny measures."
31:50;31:52;"So I retweeted that."
31:52;31:54;"I got on Twitter and I did a rare retweet."
31:54;31:58;"And now I'm picturing the Beto O'Rourke email, subject line, ""Ariana Grande."""
31:58;32:03;"Even Bernie Sanders is getting tweets off Ariana Grande."
32:03;32:06;"I need my Beto army."
32:06;32:11;"Subject line, ""Time crisis."""
32:11;32:15;"Even as an ex-indie rocker, I thought I could count on the support of contemporary prominent"
32:15;32:19;"indie rock musician, Ezra Koenig."
32:19;32:20;"Beto, you could."
32:20;32:22;"Just not for president, man."
32:22;32:24;"But I would respect the s--t of Beto if he was like, ""You know what?"
32:24;32:26;"F--k this s--t. I'm out."""
32:26;32:29;"I'm out and I'm going to go campaign hard for Bernie."
32:29;32:33;"Well, yeah, and there's also like another Texas Senate seat coming up, right?"
32:33;32:34;"Right."
32:34;32:35;"Yeah, he could run against the other guy."
32:35;32:36;"I wonder if people in Texas would be like, ""Bro, really?"""
32:36;32:39;"I mean, that would be the most brutal if it was kind of like you almost beat Ted Cruz."
32:39;32:40;"Right."
32:40;32:43;"And then you squandered the goodwill at home and abroad."
32:43;32:44;"Yeah."
32:44;32:46;"With this presidential campaign and then you go back to Texas."
32:46;32:47;"And people are just like..."
32:47;32:48;"Yeah, you lost five points."
32:48;32:49;"Yeah."
32:49;32:50;"You just can't make it back up."
32:50;32:51;"Yeah."
32:51;32:52;"Come on, Beto."
32:52;32:54;"Just go full-time and be like a Bernie guy."
32:54;32:57;"Even..."
32:57;33:01;"Beto army, I need you to flood Ariana's mentions."
33:01;33:02;"Beto army."
33:02;33:04;"Make sure she sees this."
33:04;33:09;"Yeah, I feel like Bernie's getting the full quote tweet back from Ariana Grande and Beto's"
33:09;33:12;"getting the, ""I hope she sees this, chief."""
33:12;33:19;"I hope she sees this."
33:19;33:30;"I hope she sees this."
33:30;33:50;"I hope she sees this."
33:50;34:14;"I hope she sees this."
34:14;34:42;"I hope she sees this."
34:42;34:49;"I hope she sees this."
34:50;34:59;"I hope she sees this."
35:08;35:18;"I hope she sees this."
35:18;35:30;"there's a picture of Trump with a Shannon Hoon, singer of Blind Melon, because Trump"
35:30;35:38;"went to a Blind Melon show in the early 90s, I think taking Don Jr. or Ivanka. So I'm curious,"
35:38;35:43;"was one of the Trump kids into both Blind Melon- like it's one thing to be like, ""Oh"
35:43;35:48;"yeah, I was a kid in the early 90s. The Grateful Dead was huge and the skull logo looked-"
35:48;35:53;"badass, so I got the poster."" If one of the kids was into the Dead and Blind Melon, now"
35:53;35:57;"we're starting to see a pattern. And going to the show. And going to the show. So one"
35:57;36:01;"of those kids was crunchy. Yeah. They were growing up with f*cking golden toilets and"
36:01;36:08;"sink faucets. Right. And they still were like- Responding to that earthy, early 70s vibes."
36:08;36:13;"So was one of the Trump kids just like a hippie, literally in a gilded cage? Well those instincts"
36:13;36:16;"have been repressed for so many decades at this point. Man, maybe- They're just gonna"
36:16;36:23;"burst out. We gotta make some stickers. Dost Don Jr. Dost Don Jr. Throw on Europe 72. And"
36:23;36:27;"just watch the waterworks turn on. This is who I am, man. I'm not down with all this"
36:27;36:33;"f*cking racist right wing sh*t, man. Imagine this. I could really imagine this. It's spring"
36:33;36:38;"'95. Don Jr's like, ""Dad, I got really good grades this year. Please let me go follow"
36:38;36:42;"the Grateful Dead."" It's like, ""What are you talking about? No, look. I took you to"
36:42;36:46;"the Blind Melon show. I let you have the poster, but enough's enough. You're gonna be taking"
36:46;36:51;"over this company one day."" He's like, ""But Dad, it's just one summer. A bunch of my friends"
36:51;36:55;"are gonna go follow the dead."" And Trump is just like, ""Absolutely not. They're a bunch"
36:55;37:01;"of losers. And you gotta start your internship program at Trump Casino in Atlantic City."""
37:01;37:05;"Or whatever. You know, succession sh*t. And then he misses out on the whole summer. And"
37:05;37:11;"guess what? Jerry dies that August. Never gets to see them again. He can't really forgive"
37:11;37:16;"his dad, but then his dad just has that imposing Logan Roy energy. Yeah, maybe he yells at"
37:16;37:21;"him the day he finds out Jerry dies. ""Dad, see what you f*cking did? Now I'll never f*cking"
37:21;37:25;"get to see them."" And then Trump is just like, holds him. He's like crying inconsolably."
37:25;37:29;"And Trump just holds him. He's like, ""It's over, Don. The Grateful Dead are over. I'm"
37:29;37:34;"glad this happened."" ""How could you say that?"" ""Because now it's finally over, my boy. The"
37:34;37:39;"Grateful Dead will never tour again. They would need to find some type of young hotshot"
37:39;37:45;"guitarist from Connecticut or something. And even then, they couldn't really call it the"
37:45;37:52;"Grateful Dead. But Don, my boy. Don, my boy, it's over."" I can totally picture that. Yeah,"
37:52;37:56;"then he dries his tears. Next day, he comes back. His hair is slicked back. ""Dad, you're"
37:56;38:01;"right. Jerry's dead."" ""It's 1995. Come on. It's time to move on."" ""It's the f*cking"
38:01;38:06;"90s, Don."" I think I've mentioned this on the show. My friend Ryan, who plays in the"
38:06;38:12;"band, has Paul Manafort's copy of a Byrds album. Wait, yeah, yeah. This is... I think"
38:12;38:18;"I've mentioned this. But yeah, he bought a used vinyl copy of the Byrds Untitled album"
38:18;38:21;"from 1969 or '70. And it just said Paul Manafort on the back. And you know how people used"
38:21;38:25;"to have their little... Stamps sometimes. Yeah, name tags with their address and phone"
38:25;38:30;"number on it. And it's Paul Manafort. Wow. Just on this Byrds album. He should mail that"
38:30;38:36;"to the prison he's in. He's in prison, right? I think he is. Manafort. Got a package for"
38:36;38:40;"you. Manafort got a package for you. Any chance this is like a John Voight, George Costanza"
38:40;38:46;"situation where it's just the same name? No, he looked up the address on the name tag."
38:46;38:51;"Wow. And it was actually in Connecticut. Legit. And that's where Paul's from. So it is the"
38:51;38:59;"same Paul Manafort. Wow. Now I'm picturing a Don Jr. handwritten dead cassette bootleg."
38:59;39:10;"Just like Giants Stadium 1990. Like, please return to Don Trump Jr. Pet House. Trump Tower."
39:10;39:15;"New York, New York. Man, maybe it's Ivanka. I don't know. But one of those Trump kids."
39:15;39:19;"Colin showed me. Shannon Hoon is definitely Ivanka. Apparently Blind Melon was one of"
39:19;39:27;"her favorite bands. Maybe all the kids were crunchy. All I can say. And then Shannon died"
39:27;39:32;"as well. Probably that year. Yeah. Trump taking out all the greats so that his kids don't"
39:32;39:38;"turn into hippies. Damn. Don, dry your eyes. Come into my office. I want you to meet somebody."
39:38;39:43;"This is Steve Miller. And I brought him here to talk to you about the Grateful Dead. Scared"
39:43;39:49;"straight. Hey, listen, Don, I know it probably sounds pretty cool. What? Taking drugs and"
39:49;39:53;"jamming a 40 minute version of playing in the band. Well, guess what, man? It's not"
39:53;40:01;"cool. It's bulls**t. It's indulgent. It's hedonistic. It's terrible. And look, I'm speaking"
40:01;40:06;"from experience. I jammed for those guys. I opened a whole tour. Don, go work for your"
40:06;40:10;"dad. Put these crazy dreams aside. Yeah, there's an alternate universe where he would have"
40:10;40:32;"started following fish. All I can say is that my life is pretty plain. I like watching the"
40:32;40:54;"point of view, but it's not safe. It's not safe. I just want someone to say to me, you"
40:54;41:07;"know, I like to keep my cheese dry today. So stay with me and I'll have it made. And I don't"
41:07;41:19;"understand why I sleep all day. And I start to complain that there's no way ahead of you."
41:19;41:29;"And all I can do is read a book to stay awake. And it rips my life away, but it's a great"
41:29;41:46;"escape. Escape. Escape. Escape."
41:46;41:49;"Let's try to get Tiffany Trump on the show. Tiffany, what's your favorite Robert Hunter"
41:49;41:54;"lyric? Maybe Tiffany's into twiddle. If we like reached out to Ivanka and were like,"
41:54;41:59;"Hey, we're doing this thing on Robert Hunter. Love to have you call in with your favorite"
41:59;42:04;"Robert Hunter lyrics. Maybe talk about your favorite dead song. I don't think it's impossible"
42:04;42:08;"that we could make it happen. Not because we have any particular sway, but she's probably"
42:08;42:15;"well, first of all, we would get destroyed for it. I think I could imagine thought exercise."
42:15;42:20;"Just imagine how much fake smiling she has to do being like, Oh yeah, this is everything's"
42:20;42:26;"going great. At the end of the day, Ivanka grew up in New York city. You know, she spent"
42:26;42:30;"her time in the kind of, I'm sure she went to high school with a mixed bag of people,"
42:30;42:36;"but trust me, Ivanka, she used to be out there hanging with the, you know, liberal Hollywood"
42:36;42:42;"type musicians and art people. So there's no way, like she's probably not letting it"
42:42;42:46;"enter her mind, but there's no way that she's not at least subconsciously clocking the fact"
42:46;42:52;"that like, she's not just closed a bunch of doors, but like burned crazy bridges. Maybe"
42:52;42:58;"she would be desperate enough to take a TC call. And just like, we're like, Ivanka, tell"
42:58;43:02;"us about that. A blind melon show. We saw the photograph on online. Oh, thank you. You"
43:02;43:06;"know, people just, they just always want to talk about my father's policies and things"
43:06;43:10;"that, you know, trust me, I try to steer my dad in the right direction. He's a good man,"
43:10;43:14;"but thank you. I, this is the real me. It's just a blind melon fan. I'm just a blind melon"
43:14;43:22;"fan from New York city. Can you imagine the blowback on that? Just like, Hey guys, that"
43:22;43:27;"would just detonate pitchfork guys. People are people. TC is all about the music, man."
43:27;43:31;"This is not a political show. This is not a political show, but look, we're not into"
43:31;43:35;"politics, man. We're into the music and blind melon rules. Can we do a fake time crisis"
43:35;43:39;"intro with Ivanka Trump? What do you mean? What do you mean? Like, what would that sound"
43:39;43:44;"like? You know, with the one of us, if we did it just to like fake people out, what"
43:44;43:51;"would that actually sound like? Time crisis back once again on this week's episode, we're"
43:51;43:56;"talking blind melon, the grateful dead, and one of the crunchiest ladies of all time,"
43:56;44:00;"Ivanka Trump. She'll join us in the studio to talk about some of her favorite early nineties"
44:00;44:11;"jam bands. All this plus the greatest hits of 1982 and 1967. This is time crisis with"
44:11;44:22;"Ezra King. Oh my God. Or just give her like super self-full questions like Ivanka. I'm"
44:22;44:26;"sure you get asked about your dad enough. What we want to know is when you get the Frito"
44:26;44:33;"Lay box at Costco, what are you going for first? Oh, well, I'm a Fritos girl. I guess"
44:33;44:39;"Ivanka Trump is a, she dropped a book a couple of years ago. This is a quote from the book"
44:39;44:45;"during my punk phase in the nineties. I was really into Nirvana. My wardrobe consisted"
44:45;44:49;"of ripped corduroy jeans and flannel shirts. One day after school, I dyed my hair blue."
44:49;44:52;"Mom wasn't a fan of my, of this decision. She took one look at me and immediately went"
44:52;44:56;"out to the nearest drugstore to buy a $10 box of nice and easy. That night she forced"
44:56;45:00;"me to dye my hair back to blonde. The color she picked was actually three shades lighter"
45:00;45:04;"than my natural color. And I've never looked back. You know, that's kind of a version of"
45:04;45:08;"the story we were just telling of being like, I was trying to become like a punk rocker"
45:08;45:12;"and get into Nirvana. And then I was punished so hard for it. Like, yeah, I made my hair"
45:12;45:17;"blue and I literally got punished so hard for it. I turned like super blonde and I never"
45:17;45:23;"went back. My punk phase. Yeah. Don Jr's version is like, I grew my hair out and came into"
45:23;45:29;"my dad's room with a, with a steal your face t-shirt. Dad took me to the nearest Brooks"
45:29;45:33;"brothers bought me a suit and I never looked back. Oh God. This is like a really crazy"
45:33;45:38;"dream now. In the early Trump days, we found something where Trump was at like a rat dog"
45:38;45:42;"show or something. Give me a number of crunch on that. It was Trump showed up at like Bob"
45:42;45:47;"weir or something. Whoa. Is there a photo of him in a weir? Oh wow. There's audio. Trump"
45:47;45:52;"introduces Bob. Oh, that's right. Oh yeah. Yeah. We played this a long time ago, but"
45:52;45:56;"it's probably about time to people that listen to the show multiple times per episode or"
45:56;46:11;"rolling their eyes now. 2006. This is 2006. People are already kind of harshed out. Yeah."
46:11;46:22;"Is that Trump? Wait, is that Trump? People are booing him. Yeah. Interesting. Trump's"
46:22;46:37;"been getting booed for years. Oh God. See this also, first of all, that's his classic"
46:37;46:44;"wrestling. He realizes people are booing him and yeah, I guess he probably wishes, just"
46:44;46:48;"wishes he had a mic when he was at the world series. Oh my God. That was insane. But this,"
46:48;46:52;"this is him. Everybody's booing him and Trump's like, okay, I'm the bad guy. I'm the undertaker"
46:52;47:00;"right now. Well guess what? Everybody Bob weirs not playing. I've got Bob. We're buried"
47:00;47:14;"in a coffin. Nobody has sold out Madison square garden more than Bob 251 times. That's not"
47:14;47:21;"true. Well, the dead, they played there 251 times. No way. It does sound like a lot. Well,"
47:21;47:27;"it's classic Trump though. Like wildly inflating the numbers to a very specific number. I mean"
47:27;47:36;"the dead by play the garden, like maybe what? 20 times. It could be more 30, 40 times, 50"
47:36;47:42;"maybe. I don't think they played there more than fish. 52. Okay. This website of the guy"
47:42;47:48;"who photographed the show says Donald actually stayed for the whole first set of the show."
47:48;47:52;"Actually stayed. Yeah. There's no, there's not really any pictures of him like posing"
47:52;47:59;"with Bob. Oh wow. There are, Oh my God. Let me see. Jesus God. That's wild. Yeah. And"
47:59;48:03;"you could even picture that also be pretty like Trump and succession is that then like"
48:03;48:08;"Don jr. Who's all like prepped out in corporate and right wing. Now I was like, uh, dad, uh,"
48:08;48:13;"did you really introduce Bob? We're in rat dog and the beacon theater. It's just business,"
48:13;48:19;"Don. But dad, you said I couldn't go on tour with the dead in 95. That's different. You"
48:19;48:28;"gotta play all the angles. There's a constituency there for me. How did he even end up there?"
48:28;48:33;"Like it's not like he like was like, I'm going to buy a ticket to see rat dog. Like maybe"
48:33;48:38;"he knows Bob's managed. Like there's some weird chain of events that led him to being"
48:38;48:44;"there. It probably unfolded like that day. Yeah. Very weird. I mean he only probably,"
48:44;48:49;"you know, live 30 blocks away. Yeah. Somebody who worked with Prince told me a story about"
48:49;48:54;"Prince playing at the garden and this was probably in a similar era in the apprentice"
48:54;48:58;"era and that Trump, you know, talked his way into the show. He probably had connections"
48:58;49:03;"with the building, you know? Sure. Like that's a, that's a funny thing with like when you"
49:03;49:07;"do shows cause you, you know, you sell as many as you can and then there's the extra"
49:07;49:12;"tickets for, you know, band guest list, the label and then the building, the building"
49:12;49:16;"always has their, you know, special things that have nothing to do with you. So probably"
49:16;49:20;"Trump had a connection with the garden. He knows Jimmy Dolan or something. So Trump wanted"
49:20;49:24;"to go to the Prince show and apparently Prince heard that he was coming and he couldn't stop"
49:24;49:28;"him from like being around and being backstage a little bit. The guy I talked to who worked"
49:28;49:32;"on the show just really stuck with him. And Prince just said, keep that guy away from"
49:32;49:37;"me. He's got bad vibes. You keep him far away from me. And then of course Trump is like,"
49:37;49:41;"kind of like, Oh, let me go say hi. And he's like, and he also was just apparently going"
49:41;49:46;"to random people like, welcome me to my seat. It's like, uh, sir, that's not what I do,"
49:46;49:51;"sir. I'm a keyboard tech. So walk me to my seat. Come on. Jesus. But Prince just had"
49:51;49:55;"this vibe where you just like, Ooh, yeah, I don't keep him away from it. I don't need"
49:55;50:18;"him in my head space. Yeah. Bad vibes."
50:18;50:48;"Okay. So clearly there's something unpacked with the Trump family and"
50:48;50:55;"the Jambans. Strange bedfellows. Yep. Oh my God. Speaking of a controversy, this is a"
50:55;50:59;"real news and politics oriented episode. This happened a few weeks ago, but it just crossed"
50:59;51:04;"my desk. Morrissey played the Hollywood bowl recently, hot off the hills of that, uh, Richard"
51:04;51:10;"pictures, tomorrow and a vampire show. And, um, at his merch stand, he was selling a t-shirt"
51:10;51:15;"that said the guardian, I guess he's referring to the newspaper has some kind of issue with"
51:15;51:20;"it. Okay. Um, and then the weird part though, is that he was also selling signed records,"
51:20;51:25;"but not Morrissey records. He's was selling signed copies of David Bowie's Aladdin, sane"
51:25;51:30;"Patty Smith's horses, Lou Reed's transformer and Iggy and the Stooges raw power all for"
51:30;51:37;"$300. I can actually imagine a Morrissey fan wanting that, but it's also like, it's such"
51:37;51:43;"a bizarre move. And what did Morrissey needs like the extra 1200 bucks of merch sales at"
51:43;51:47;"the Hollywood bowl. Do you think it was just one copy of each album? Like it was from his"
51:47;51:51;"personal collection and like kind of shop worn or was it just like, maybe you just had"
51:51;51:55;"a, like a stack of great idea that day. And you just like, it was like, send somebody"
51:55;52:01;"he's like, go to Amoeba by seven copies of Lou Reed's transformer and bring me a Sharpie"
52:01;52:07;"brand new reissue. Yeah. Taking the cellophane off. Yeah. Probably technically illegal if"
52:07;52:12;"it's a brand new copy. Well, like, can you just like buy stuff? I guess you can. Oh."
52:12;52:17;"And just like mark it up. It's a weird idea. Right. Just like go to Amoeba. Yeah. Buy like"
52:17;52:24;"a new reissue of Steve Miller's greatest hits. Yeah. For 2799. Yeah. I guess I could. Then"
52:24;52:28;"I can just put on eBay and be like, this is 20 and especially you, especially you as an"
52:28;52:32;"American painter, you could always just call it art. Oh, right. Here's a signed copy of"
52:32;52:39;"Steve Miller's greatest hits. Oh my God. $40,000. That's Andy Warhol lives on steroids. Morrissey"
52:39;52:46;"is selling an X-Box two with a Morrissey sticker on the top for $3,000 at his show in San Francisco."
52:46;52:52;"Just like really random stuff. A poster for the film devil's advocate, starring Al Pacino"
52:52;52:57;"and Keanu Reeves signed by Morrissey. That one's a hundred thousand dollars at a recent"
52:57;53:06;"Morrissey show. A recent Morrissey show. There were multiple sacks of 10 from white castle"
53:06;53:12;"selling one burger at a time, 30 bucks a piece. That'd be tight. If Morrissey just like rolls"
53:12;53:17;"up to where is it's Costco where, where Kirkland signature is the home brand. I feel like this"
53:17;53:21;"would happen to like a school fair. It's like the bake sale and somebody's parents are just"
53:21;53:26;"like, Oh, well here's a 40 pack of like giant muffins, Kirkland signature brand muffins."
53:26;53:30;"You can sell them, I don't know, for five bucks a piece. It's just like Morrissey sends"
53:30;53:38;"somebody to just bring back all this like Kirkland signature bull. This might be illegal."
53:38;53:42;"Morrissey sends somebody to Costco to buy like the Frito-Lay value packs. And he started"
53:42;53:46;"selling the individual bags of lays that say not for resale. Exactly. Morrissey is selling"
53:46;53:51;"them for 20. It's not even that dramatic. He's just selling them for $4 each. It's like"
53:51;53:56;"the first lawsuit in history where Frito-Lay actually sued somebody for selling, but not"
53:56;54:03;"for resale bags of lays. Morrissey killed it on those Frito-Lays. They made $160 that"
54:03;54:08;"night at the Hollywood bowl. Well, you got to understand. I wonder how much they made"
54:08;54:13;"those like off those records. Cause the Hollywood bowl is like a huge venue. So like a few thousand"
54:13;54:18;"dollars here, there's like not going to really move the needle. Oh yeah. You know, despite"
54:18;54:22;"some of the controversy around Morrissey, he's been accused of being a anti-immigrant"
54:22;54:27;"racist. He still does have a very passionate fan base, especially in Southern California."
54:27;54:31;"So you can imagine somebody like Morrissey he's making loads of money just selling t-shirts"
54:31;54:36;"that night. So yeah, it's a drop in the bucket. This was just an idea that he had. Wait Seinfeld."
54:36;54:41;"Actually, this is a real number crunch. How much does one of those Frito-Lays value packs"
54:41;54:42;"cost?"
54:42;54:51;"Now let's get a number crunch. Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000. We got the Frito-Lay"
54:51;54:55;"classic mix variety, 18 count for $7 from Walmart."
54:55;54:59;"What's in that? We got lays, Cheetos, Doritos."
54:59;55:00;"Two kinds of Doritos, Sun Chips."
55:00;55:06;"I got lays, Fritos, Cheetos, Doritos. Do you know that song? It kind of comes back every"
55:06;55:10;"Thanksgiving. So it's seasonally appropriate. She's actually a very famous gospel singer,"
55:10;55:15;"right? She's kind of singing a song, but it's also taking the, you know, she's also preaching"
55:15;55:18;"a little bit, you know, obviously gospel music is religious. And I think she's telling kind"
55:18;55:22;"of a Bible story where she's talking about all these animals that somebody has and animals"
55:22;55:27;"and vegetables, right? I got rams, lambs, potatoes, tomatoes. I think it's like a character"
55:27;55:30;"in the Bible is saying this. And so she's naming all these things. And then there's,"
55:30;55:34;"she goes, you name it. And it became like their remixes. It's just one of those, you"
55:34;55:37;"know, similar to rise and shine. It just became a meme."
55:37;55:38;"Shirley Caesar."
55:38;55:42;"Shirley Caesar. So in the gospel community, from what I understand, she's very well-known"
55:42;55:47;"icon, but then she became a meme for the younger generation. I got rams, lambs, potatoes, tomatoes."
55:47;55:51;"And I just can't believe I just thought of this. I got Cheetos, Fritos Doritos. I got"
55:51;56:00;"lay. You name it. Okay. So anyway, you said you can get 18 of those little ones for $7."
56:00;56:01;"So what's the unit price on that?"
56:01;56:02;"39 cents."
56:02;56:06;"This is actually like, you know, when there's like kids on the subway just selling candy"
56:06;56:10;"for their baseball team. That's usually what you do. Somebody went to Costco or something,"
56:10;56:14;"got a value pack probably is like 30 cents per Twizzler. But if the kid sells it for"
56:14;56:18;"a dollar, that's a decent little profit, you know, raising money for your team or your"
56:18;56:24;"charity or whatever. So just imagine straight up at a show. Morrissey is like just talking"
56:24;56:29;"to his merch guys. Like I have a brilliant idea. You know, I've really been thinking"
56:29;56:34;"I, I think we could be selling a lot, making a lot more money and by, I think I'm getting"
56:34;56:39;"the texture of his voice, right? Not the accent, the Manchester accent too specific and by"
56:39;56:43;"those Frito lays. What's the official name? A Frito lay."
56:43;56:49;"Classic mix variety pack. And by Frito lay classic mix variety pack. I crunched the numbers"
56:49;56:56;"and really we're looking at 39 cents a unit. We can sell them for $1. Now I'm just totally"
56:56;57:06;"losing, melting down. We sell them for $1. That's 61 cents profit. Quite a tidy sum."
57:06;57:17;"That sounds like a new Morrissey song. Reselling Doritos for a tidy sum. So he's making 61"
57:17;57:25;"cents per. The issue with this would be that volume, volume, volume. A, you have to move"
57:25;57:30;"a lot of volume and B, you know, the building in this case, the Hollywood bowl, they're"
57:30;57:36;"making quite a tidy sum selling their own food. So that could turn into a real brawl."
57:36;57:42;"Yep. Also, isn't there like animal byproducts in the chips that would violate Morrissey's"
57:42;57:45;"maybe in the Cheetos. That'd be a let, cause you know, Morrissey's"
57:45;57:52;"famously a hardcore vegetarian. Yeah. Is he vegan? Maybe vegan. Freegan. It's a free."
57:52;57:57;"He identifies as a freegan. Morrissey caught eating a plate of Buffalo Wild Wings. They"
57:57;58:07;"had extra, but most flavors of Doritos are not vegan. They contain cheese, milk, buttermilk"
58:07;58:10;"way. But is Morrissey vegan or just vegetarian?"
58:10;58:14;"He's vegan. Okay. But so what's the no go on those Cheetos? Okay. But the Fritos. Fritos,"
58:14;58:18;"I think are probably vegan. That would definitely eat into his profits."
58:18;58:23;"If he bought all the value packs, then remembered, Oh yeah, not the cheese isn't vegan. And then"
58:23;58:27;"they had to throw everything out. But the Fritos for the record, Fritos are vegan. The"
58:27;58:36;"other Frito flavors are not, but the original Fritos are vegan. Fritos are vegan. I pictured"
58:36;58:42;"like being at a school event where they're just like lays $1. So 71 cents profit and"
58:42;58:46;"in Seinfeld, can you get a better deal? Can you get a better per unit deal? If you what's"
58:46;58:51;"like the biggest 48 count? Yeah. What's the biggest count Frito-Lay box you can get on"
58:51;58:57;"Amazon? I'm seeing a 50 count. Whoa. Yeah. I think 50, 50 is the largest. All right."
58:57;59:01;"So let's get a number of crunch. If you buy the 50 pack, what's your per unit price? 29"
59:01;59:07;"cents. We got down to 29 cents. That's a real tidy sum. Now we're at 71 cents. Maybe vampire."
59:07;59:12;"We can just got to do this track one on the new record. A tidy sum, a tidy sum. Fritos"
59:12;59:23;"are vegan. Track two Fritos are vegan. Time crisis with Ezra Koenig. You know what I'm"
59:23;59:28;"thinking more about this? Uh, the Morrissey and the, I thought of two things. One is this"
59:28;59:33;"is on the tip of my tongue. So, you know, there's a Smith song, meat is murder. Yeah."
59:33;59:37;"Great song. That's prime Morrissey. That's when he was great. Just like, it's kind of,"
59:37;59:41;"you know, taking a stand for something good. Now I'm picturing a version of meat is murder"
59:41;59:46;"where that's like a little softer where he's kind of just like the whole song, rather than"
59:46;59:50;"just being like, what the is wrong with you? Disgusting people who murder animals. The"
59:50;59:54;"whole thing is like, guys, why do you have to eat animals when, when Fritos are vegan?"
59:54;59:58;"And it's really just more of like a, a kind of like guys, don't you like, Oh, you think"
59:58;01:00:01;"it's going to be so hard to be vegan? No, no, we get to eat Fritos, man. It's cool."
01:00:01;01:00:06;"So then I always loved this line, the chorus, the real one goes and the flesh you so fancifully"
01:00:06;01:00:14;"fry. That's so classic. And the flesh you so fancifully fry is not succulent, tasty"
01:00:14;01:00:19;"or kind it's death for no reason. And death for no reason is murder. But I'm picturing"
01:00:19;01:00:25;"when like, and the flesh you so fancifully fry is not succulent, tasty or kind it's death"
01:00:25;01:00:31;"for no reason. And don't you know, Fritos are vegan. Just being like, why death for"
01:00:31;01:00:36;"no reason when Fritos are vegan Fritos never killed nobody. I was thinking about that."
01:00:36;01:00:41;"And then, and then the last thing I'll say, this is classic TC just beating the dead horse."
01:00:41;01:00:45;"And now I'm also picturing like, this is actually a funnier with Steve Miller or like, or Don"
01:00:45;01:00:50;"Henley, just like an older crotchety American dude. Just like not only just doing that at"
01:00:50;01:00:54;"the show, selling the individual, not for resale bags for a dollar and making a tidy"
01:00:54;01:00:58;"sum of 71 cents, but also just like during a break during the show, just be like, now,"
01:00:58;01:01:02;"Hey guys, you might've noticed I'm selling Doritos, Fritos and Lay's. Now, now listen"
01:01:02;01:01:09;"to this. I send the interns over to Costco, my per unit price. And just like, just like"
01:01:09;01:01:15;"saying that to like a stadium. And then the last rent crickets, he's like waiting for"
01:01:15;01:01:21;"a big thing. He's like, and the grand total, my per unit profit, like the drummer. It's"
01:01:21;01:01:49;"like Bruce Brinksley, my per unit profit, Max Weinberg, 71 cents. This is dirty laundry."
01:01:49;01:02:15;"I just have to look good. I don't have to be clear."
01:02:15;01:02:32;"And then the last random thing I'll say, cause it stayed with me. I think I mentioned on"
01:02:32;01:02:36;"the last episode, how I read Elton John's book. I got to pass that around to the rest"
01:02:36;01:02:40;"of the crew, but two things. Cause you know, Elton's had this incredible life. He's knows"
01:02:40;01:02:44;"everybody, but I wondered, would there be any grateful dead talk in the book? And if"
01:02:44;01:02:48;"we ever get Elton on TC, cause you know, I went on his show. I'd love to get him on."
01:02:48;01:02:52;"He had me call in. I didn't go in person. I haven't met him in person, but he's real"
01:02:52;01:02:58;"sweet. Super into father of the bride. The one reference to the grateful dead. He tells"
01:02:58;01:03:04;"this story about how he had such mixed feelings about going to the rock and roll hall of fame"
01:03:04;01:03:10;"to be inducted in 1994. He tells the story that he was driving his husband, David Furnish"
01:03:10;01:03:14;"crazy because he would literally like get dressed and then like get in the car and just"
01:03:14;01:03:19;"be like, I don't want to do it. And then he'd be like, no, I should probably accept it."
01:03:19;01:03:22;"And then like they get in the limo and they like get to the rock and roll hall of fame"
01:03:22;01:03:25;"ceremony. He'd like walk inside and then just look around and be like, it's a bunch of skeletons"
01:03:25;01:03:28;"in here and like leave. Like I said, he's very funny and self-aware in how he writes"
01:03:28;01:03:34;"about himself. But he talks about that as being kind of an example of his peak mania"
01:03:34;01:03:38;"where he just had such mixed feelings about, is it corny to be at the rock and roll hall"
01:03:38;01:03:42;"of fame? Is this a bad thing? Am I lame for going? Am I lame for not going? And he was"
01:03:42;01:03:47;"just so in his head about it. One thing he says, he's like the grateful dead got on stage"
01:03:47;01:03:52;"and Jerry Garcia refused to go. They had to bring a cardboard cutout of him. Maybe Jerry"
01:03:52;01:03:56;"had the right idea after all. So it's funny. So basically Elton John is like, he's having"
01:03:56;01:04:02;"this real crisis of morality. And then I watched the video of the dead accepting and the dead"
01:04:02;01:04:07;"get up there and it's all the guys, you know, Jerry. No. And then at the very end, they"
01:04:07;01:04:10;"bring out this cardboard cutout of Jerry and they're like, and Hey Jerry. And apparently"
01:04:10;01:04:16;"just Jerry didn't want to go. That's corny, man. All these hierarchies. So Elton John"
01:04:16;01:04:20;"was like, yeah, he finally sits down and then this cardboard cutout of Jerry is like the"
01:04:20;01:04:25;"one dude who like actually felt the same way. Wow. Yeah. So anyway, that's the one reference"
01:04:25;01:04:29;"to the grateful dead in Elton John's book. And also another reason why I think Elton"
01:04:29;01:04:34;"John would be right at home on TC is because later in the book, he became a father very"
01:04:34;01:04:39;"late in life. So he has two kids and you know, so he's making a decision. He and his husband"
01:04:39;01:04:43;"are talking about it. And he said, my, my husband, uh, who had become his manager at"
01:04:43;01:04:50;"the time basically gave him like a 10 or 15 year plan. And he said, now listen, you know,"
01:04:50;01:04:53;"you're still hot. You can go tour around the world. You can make loads of money. I'm going"
01:04:53;01:04:58;"to be keeping an eye on all this stuff. But what I need you to tell me is like, you know,"
01:04:58;01:05:01;"obviously it's his husband and his manager. So he's like, so let's compare your touring"
01:05:01;01:05:05;"schedule to family life. So he said, you know, cause I just want you to keep in mind if you"
01:05:05;01:05:10;"go tour hard this year, that's the year that, you know, one of our sons is going to be in"
01:05:10;01:05:14;"eighth grade and you would miss this and you might miss his first, you know, day of school"
01:05:14;01:05:18;"as a freshman and his high school graduation. He basically painted him this picture of like,"
01:05:18;01:05:22;"this is what will be going on with our kids for the next 15 years. And he said to Elton,"
01:05:22;01:05:26;"what do you want to be here for? You know, cause cause Elton John might've been like,"
01:05:26;01:05:30;"well, okay. If I miss a few summers with the boys, that's okay. Or if I miss like part"
01:05:30;01:05:33;"of their school year, but we make up, you know, you could imagine what kind of conversation"
01:05:33;01:05:36;"somebody might have. And then Elton, it's a sweet moment says, you know what? I want"
01:05:36;01:05:40;"to be here for all of it. And that's when he's kind of like, I'm not going to tour as"
01:05:40;01:05:43;"hard as I used to. And let's figure out how to only do private. I don't know what, whatever"
01:05:43;01:05:47;"he came up with. And then the way he writes about it is saying like, you know, I realized"
01:05:47;01:05:51;"I wanted to be there for all of it. I don't want to miss it. Aerosmith style. I don't"
01:05:51;01:05:55;"want to miss a thing. And then he says the idea that like something special could be"
01:05:55;01:06:00;"happening in my boy's life. And I might be at Madison square garden or the Staples center"
01:06:00;01:06:05;"or Taco Bell arena in Boise. It crushed me. Yeah. It's like, he just said it cause it"
01:06:05;01:06:09;"was funny. That rules. He must've played there or seen it somewhere and just been like Taco"
01:06:09;01:06:14;"Bell arena in Boise. That's a funny name. So he moved the family to Vegas. Yeah. He"
01:06:14;01:06:18;"kind of, I guess he figured it out. Yeah. Boys, you're going to grow up in Vegas. Dad,"
01:06:18;01:06:22;"just go play Taco Bell arena. Actually Vegas seems like an interesting place to grow up."
01:06:22;01:06:28;"And I think the, the real, the real Vegans are people called Las Vegas, Las Vegas. I"
01:06:28;01:06:32;"think, uh, no, I think they're Las Vegas on the rare occasion that you meet a true native"
01:06:32;01:06:36;"Las Vegas. Yeah. They're very interesting people. Cause you know, it's like they get"
01:06:36;01:06:40;"to watch this crazy cross section of the rest of the country and world come in through their"
01:06:40;01:06:44;"city. I've always been curious because I've never actually gotten to see it because every"
01:06:44;01:06:47;"time I've been in Vegas, you know, you stay on the strip or you, you know, we were just"
01:06:47;01:06:53;"that life is beautiful. It can be really hard to meet the, you know, the permanent residents,"
01:06:53;01:06:58;"the locals. Yeah. But it must be a fascinating town to grow up in the shadow of all that"
01:06:58;01:07:03;"vice. Yeah. I wonder what, like, what does a suburb of Vegas look like? Probably like"
01:07:03;01:07:09;"a suburb of Phoenix or well, cause the desert starts so quick. Right? Yeah. Cause in movies,"
01:07:09;01:07:13;"movies that take place in Vegas, like casino or something, I feel like every good Vegas"
01:07:13;01:07:17;"movie always has a scene where they're just out and just like the rawest empty desert"
01:07:17;01:07:21;"they got in the car for 10 minutes. Yeah. And then they're just like on Mars. The time"
01:07:21;01:07:26;"I've driven through and played a few shows there about 20 years ago. Yeah. Wolf kernel."
01:07:26;01:07:31;"Yeah. Wolf kernel shows. And it was a real indie DIY. Yeah. They were in like, you know,"
01:07:31;01:07:37;"like an all ages show and like a coffee shop. Yeah. Like in a strip mall in like residential"
01:07:37;01:07:42;"Vegas. So you have seen true residential Vegas. I remember it just being pretty stark. I have"
01:07:42;01:07:47;"a vague memory being on tour and stopping for lunch in Cheyenne, Wyoming and seeing"
01:07:47;01:07:51;"that there were these like houses that look like they were from the 1880s, 1890s. Yeah."
01:07:51;01:07:55;"Like Victorian, Victorian frontier. So I wonder if there's, there must be towns in Nevada"
01:07:55;01:08:00;"like that. You know who would be a good person to get on the, on the program? Vegas centric."
01:08:00;01:08:05;"Yeah. Brandon flowers. Brandon flowers. Yeah. Jimmy Kimmel. Why? Why Jimmy Kimmel? He's"
01:08:05;01:08:08;"from Vegas. Jimmy Kimmel's from Vegas. I don't know why I know that, but he is. Yeah. Shout"
01:08:08;01:08:12;"out to Jimmy Kimmel. He, he listened to the Huey Lewis episode and he tweeted about it."
01:08:12;01:08:16;"That's right. That's awesome. I like that. He tweeted everybody check out this interview"
01:08:16;01:08:20;"with Huey Lewis. You should listen to it. It's cool. It starts at the 41 minute Mark."
01:08:20;01:08:24;"And then we had a couple of TC heads in the comments being like, don't sleep on that first"
01:08:24;01:08:30;"41, man. Don't don't sleep on that mountain. Brews break down that SLC soundboard. Yeah,"
01:08:30;01:08:34;"seriously. I wonder if Jimmy Kimmel listened to that. No, he scrubbed. He scrubbed forward"
01:08:34;01:08:39;"to that Huey Lewis. He scrabbled past. Yeah. He's scrabbled past. I wonder if the Elton"
01:08:39;01:08:45;"that was so tormented about the decision to go to the rock and roll hall of fame ceremony"
01:08:45;01:08:52;"in 1994, what that Elton felt like about the Vegas residency. Well, he said one interesting"
01:08:52;01:08:56;"thing in the book about it, which is one thing about him is he's a huge, huge music collector"
01:08:56;01:09:01;"and nerd. Yeah. So he talks about how like he was pretty checked out from streaming because"
01:09:01;01:09:05;"he just, at one point he owned, he bought this off a DJ. He owned every single released"
01:09:05;01:09:13;"in the UK from like 1955 to 1975. He literally owned maybe millions, at least hundreds of"
01:09:13;01:09:17;"thousands of records. Jesus Christ. And he's a huge stats geek too. He talks about when"
01:09:17;01:09:22;"he was growing up, he was obsessed with soccer and he was also just obsessed with the charts."
01:09:22;01:09:27;"And I watched this. Wow. He would be good for TC. Yeah. Seriously. I bet we'd be like,"
01:09:27;01:09:33;"I mean, comparing the top five is to September, 1972. And he'd just be like, BG's, but just"
01:09:33;01:09:38;"rain man style, just list them off. And, and he says how you would always keep a little"
01:09:38;01:09:42;"notebook where he would, he would just like write down the charts. And then he continued"
01:09:42;01:09:48;"to do that into adulthood. He was like obsessively watching his own singles and things like that."
01:09:48;01:09:52;"So when he talks about the rock and roll hall of fame, I think his feeling was because he"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"was such a hardcore rock and roll guy. He was like the beginning of the rock and roll"
01:09:55;01:10:01;"hall of fame, which was about honoring the original rockers, the 1950s originators. He"
01:10:01;01:10:05;"loved that because he felt like there are all these people, you know, the, I don't know"
01:10:05;01:10:08;"who he's talking about. Little Richard and probably people whose names aren't even as"
01:10:08;01:10:12;"big as little Richard. He was talking about, you know, these original American artists,"
01:10:12;01:10:17;"mostly black American artists who, you know, influenced the British people and all this."
01:10:17;01:10:23;"So he loved that. He just said he found it a little hoity toity to be honoring, you know,"
01:10:23;01:10:26;"who came next. He just didn't see the point. And when he talks about his Vegas show, I"
01:10:26;01:10:30;"guess the first time he did a Vegas show, it was like very controversial because he"
01:10:30;01:10:34;"hired David LaChapelle, the photographer, and they made it like very provocative. He"
01:10:34;01:10:39;"was a little bit too early to do a very provocative Vegas show. So I think he saw it as a, an"
01:10:39;01:10:44;"art form that you could do something interesting in. And also now everybody does it. Blink-182"
01:10:44;01:10:49;"did a Vegas residency recently. It's 25 years after you released your first album that you're"
01:10:49;01:10:59;"eligible for the rock and roll hall of fame. Wait, so 14 years from now, 2033, 2033, 2033."
01:10:59;01:11:05;"We think about me playing on the Vegas strip, dude, vampire weekend on the strip and rock"
01:11:05;01:11:09;"and roll hall of fame induction. Yeah. The year we get induction to the rock and roll"
01:11:09;01:11:14;"hall of fame, do a Vegas residency. Yeah. The Richard Victor's opening. That'd be tight."
01:11:14;01:11:25;"All right. Should we get into the top five? It's time for the top five on iTunes. All"
01:11:25;01:11:31;"right. So this week on the top five, which again, we can last time, how many TCs don't"
01:11:31;01:11:36;"have a top five? That's one for the stat sets. Maybe Elton knows this week on the top five,"
01:11:36;01:11:42;"we're comparing the top five songs on iTunes right now to the top five songs this week"
01:11:42;01:11:48;"in 1972 on the billboard charts. Why 1972? Cause Europe 72 simple as that. Also it's"
01:11:48;01:11:52;"the year that Beto was born. Our boy. Beto was born. I haven't done a seventies one in"
01:11:52;01:11:57;"a minute. Yeah. We're kind of getting back to the tasteful palate. The number five song."
01:11:57;01:12:01;"Oh, this is curious to me. I know as a, as a stats geek myself, that the song is from"
01:12:01;01:12:08;"the sixties moody blues nights in white satin. So, uh, I got to read up on this while originally"
01:12:08;01:12:14;"released in 1967 to marginal success only hit one Oh three in the U S nights and white"
01:12:14;01:12:18;"satin was re-released in the U S in 1972 and peaked at number two on the billboard hot"
01:12:18;01:12:22;"100. Weird. Maybe it was too ahead of its time in the seventies. Prog rock was finally"
01:12:22;01:12:29;"hitting and the moody blues like kind of got their respect. Super orchestral epic. Yeah,"
01:12:29;01:12:33;"it's funny. They're probably trying to like riff on like pet sounds or something, but"
01:12:33;01:12:50;"it ends up being more seventies. Yeah, totally. Great song."
01:12:50;01:13:19;"Never reaching the end. Never meaning to say. Just be good on a tasteful palate of the late"
01:13:19;01:13:27;"sixties. This song time of the season by the zombies and a proko harem. Yeah. Whiter shade"
01:13:27;01:13:34;"of pal walk away. Renee. Yeah. Doesn't this song go into like some weird spoken word part?"
01:13:34;01:13:39;"Well, yeah, this whole song is like eight minutes. I'm going to skip ahead. Eight minute"
01:13:39;01:13:47;"nights, eight minutes single in 67 is tough. This is where it gets super Prague. This is"
01:13:47;01:14:00;"also like very game of thrones. The Targaryens."
01:14:00;01:14:18;"We're fully out of like rock and pop at this point. Right. For orchestra. How does Game"
01:14:18;01:14:36;"of Thrones go? Yeah, yeah. Just like teenagers listening to this like babes and but this"
01:14:36;01:14:54;"part sucks. Like Beethoven or something, dude. This loves to people look back and lament"
01:14:54;01:14:59;"another day's useless energy spent. Impassioned lovers. Lonely man cries for love and has"
01:14:59;01:15:06;"a very game of thrones here. Do you mother picks up and settles her son? Senior citizens"
01:15:06;01:15:15;"were she's just citizens. I wonder what the context of that phrase was like. It's so poetic."
01:15:15;01:15:23;"You think you would just be like the ancient one, right? Elders decide which is right."
01:15:23;01:15:33;"Which is an illusion. But that was an illusion. But that was an illusion. Jesus Christ. That's"
01:15:33;01:15:39;"like a parody of. Yeah, but I guess they were inventing it. That's so funny. Yeah, it really"
01:15:39;01:15:46;"is proto Prague. It has like that like insanely pretentious, overly complicated vibe. I feel"
01:15:46;01:15:53;"like there was a disco nights in white that maybe Giorgio Marotta did one later. Nice"
01:15:53;01:16:02;"in white satin. Never leave in the year. Yeah, Giorgio Marotta did a nights in white satin."
01:16:02;01:16:08;"How does this sound? Check this out during the week of December 2nd, 1972. The song dropped"
01:16:08;01:16:14;"from number 17 to off the charts completely, setting the record for the biggest drop out"
01:16:14;01:16:19;"of the hot 100 in a single week. So people were just like, dude, that last four burned"
01:16:19;01:16:36;"out on that last four. This is weird as hell. Cool. Whisper vocals. Oh, everybody in the"
01:16:36;01:16:41;"comment section is Sopranos brought me here. I guess they play this in a scene where Tony's"
01:16:41;01:16:49;"having a drink at the bottom. Kind of Reznor style vocals there. Yeah. Cold hearted orb"
01:16:49;01:16:57;"that rules the night. For a tidy sum. For a tidy sum. The Frito lays. For a tidy sum."
01:16:57;01:17:07;"Fritos can be yours. But what's that behind the ancient doors? 71 cents. That's a fascinating"
01:17:07;01:17:13;"song. The number five song, the Knights in White Satin of 2019 is our good friends, YouTubers"
01:17:13;01:17:21;"Dan and Shay and Justin Bieber. Oh, tight. We're kind of hard on this song. I felt bad"
01:17:21;01:17:26;"about it. But it's just because we're so team. If it's meant to be, it'll be. This song became"
01:17:26;01:17:30;"the highest charting non holiday country song in the history of the Billboard streaming"
01:17:30;01:17:36;"songs chart. I think after the last episode with this on my Wikipedia page took a real"
01:17:36;01:17:41;"beating. Oh, yeah, that's true. We had some real pranksters out there. I think it's back"
01:17:41;01:17:46;"to normal now. They're saying that you are a YouTuber. Yeah, you're back to just being"
01:17:46;01:17:53;"a painter, musician and Internet radio personality. And actually, those same people did attack"
01:17:53;01:17:58;"the D.D.O.S. on Dan and Shay and made them YouTubers as well. OK, that we can support."
01:17:58;01:18:03;"Well, Dan and Shay actually are YouTubers, right? I think we determined they're not YouTube."
01:18:03;01:18:10;"OK, but Justin Bieber is a YouTuber for sure. Justin Bieber came up on YouTube. He's a YouTuber."
01:18:10;01:18:15;"OK, but he's his generation. You could be proud to be a YouTuber innovator. See, that's"
01:18:15;01:18:19;"why I think we need to do a Mountain Bruce music video, because then Jake can officially"
01:18:19;01:18:22;"be a YouTuber. Oh, yeah. I don't think we talked about it on the show that was on the"
01:18:22;01:18:28;"text thread. Oh, yeah. Let's do it. Do doing an official Mountain Bruce video. My idea"
01:18:28;01:18:34;"is that it should be like insanely high budget, expensive looking. We shoot it on film. And"
01:18:34;01:18:37;"I think somebody on the third was saying it should be very true to the story of the song,"
01:18:37;01:18:43;"which I'm totally into. Yeah. The only characters in the song is the narrator, the Jake. Yeah."
01:18:43;01:18:48;"And then Bobby. Someone's going to play Bobby. My pitch was Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jake"
01:18:48;01:18:53;"and Brad Pitt plays Bobby. Our kind of reunion after Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. I like"
01:18:53;01:18:56;"where you're at. They both live in L.A. so it wouldn't be hard to get them to go for"
01:18:56;01:19:01;"a hike. I never thought of the characters being old. I like that. Oh, yeah. And they"
01:19:01;01:19:05;"had like a rough night of drinking. They're just like, got to shake the cobwebs off. I"
01:19:05;01:19:10;"guess if we really want to, like, expand the Mountain Bruce fan base, we could make it"
01:19:10;01:19:18;"appeal more to younger people. I'll get some YouTubers a star. Yeah. We get to the guys"
01:19:18;01:19:25;"from BTS. I like that picture. It's a real long stress ask landscapes. Sure. The cinematography"
01:19:25;01:19:29;"should be really true to your art. Oh, yeah. The truth is you could do it anywhere where"
01:19:29;01:19:33;"there's mountains right here. It could be in Southern California. Maybe Glendale. BTS"
01:19:33;01:19:37;"does it in Korea. Oh, everyone makes their own Mountain Bruce video. Oh, that's not a"
01:19:37;01:19:43;"bad idea. Fan contest. Yeah. Gauntlet thrown to the fan base. Or we could get like famous"
01:19:43;01:19:48;"mountain climbers. The guy from Free Solo. Oh, yeah. No, but I like I think there's more"
01:19:48;01:19:55;"gravitas if it's kind of like older. Yeah. People guys in their 40s or old 30s. Older"
01:19:55;01:20:02;"people. Beto Bob Weir and Donald Trump. Don doesn't hike. Bill Kreutzman and Mickey Hart."
01:20:02;01:20:09;"Perfect. Beto would be tight. Me and Beto got late last night. Actually, in that first"
01:20:09;01:20:13;"email that I referenced, he talked. I think he's going for a hike like in the hills of"
01:20:13;01:20:18;"El Paso, like up the mountains. Yeah. A couple of mountain brews in that backpack. That's"
01:20:18;01:20:25;"new Beto email subject line. Mountain brews. Ezra hyphen. Sunday morning. Why don't we"
01:20:25;01:20:33;"go for a hike? The trailhead lot around a quarter to three. Already confusing. It'll"
01:20:33;01:20:36;"be Sunday morning or two forty five. Well, actually, that is a question I want to ask"
01:20:36;01:20:40;"you about Mountain Bruce. Sunday morning. The text comes through. Why don't we go for"
01:20:40;01:20:45;"a hike? Yeah. And then you're like, OK, I need about five hours to get ready for this."
01:20:45;01:20:49;"Sunday morning is just kind of like the scene setter. Right. I picture you're hung over"
01:20:49;01:20:53;"as hell. It's like 10 a.m. super hung over, still in bed. Oh, grab the phone. It's from"
01:20:53;01:20:58;"Bobby. Why don't we go for a hike? And you're just like, all right, dude, when do you have"
01:20:58;01:21:03;"in mind whenever you want, man? One dude. Let's meet at the trailhead lot around a quarter"
01:21:03;01:21:11;"to three. OK, that's all good. All right. See you in five hours. I mean, that's real."
01:21:11;01:21:16;"Oh, absolutely. That's some real. I'm going to go back to sleep for two. Take a shower."
01:21:16;01:21:21;"Get some food in me. Go to the diner. Yeah, dude, I did that this weekend. We had a rager"
01:21:21;01:21:25;"at our house. Yeah. You're super hung over. Dude, hit hit this place. Cocos. Yeah. I've"
01:21:25;01:21:30;"heard of this place. Yeah. Old diner on York. This is a first for me. Yeah. Threw up in"
01:21:30;01:21:37;"the bathroom. Oh, 42 year old man. Holy. Oh, wait. Oh, dude. Wait, I got to go to the."
01:21:37;01:21:40;"This is the first time you threw up in the bathroom period or that you were so hung over"
01:21:40;01:21:44;"you threw up in the bathroom. First time I've thrown up in a bathroom at a restaurant. I"
01:21:44;01:21:51;"threw up in the bathroom of a corner bistro in downtown Manhattan when I was in my mid"
01:21:51;01:21:56;"20s. I really barely drink anymore. I'm having a Stella right now. But I remember at the"
01:21:56;01:22:00;"time, you know, I just I always felt like sometimes I could drink a lot and sometimes"
01:22:00;01:22:04;"it wasn't for me. But I remember it was when I just I can't. I wonder if I ever told this"
01:22:04;01:22:08;"story. Maybe not. I don't think I'm TC. But I just remember at some point I was probably"
01:22:08;01:22:13;"like 25 and I had a dirty martini for the first time. I think sometimes if you're not"
01:22:13;01:22:18;"sure if you're a drinker or not, you're always just looking for what's my drink. Sure. And"
01:22:18;01:22:23;"I think I had a dirty martini and I was like, wow, this actually tastes good to me. I love"
01:22:23;01:22:27;"that. It's like salty. I never really liked sugary fruity drinks. I was like, I love that"
01:22:27;01:22:32;"it's salty and it comes, you know, an ice cold, dirty martini. Man, I could slam this."
01:22:32;01:22:37;"This makes me happy to drink. So I remember I was sitting at I was at some hotel. I remember"
01:22:37;01:22:40;"this is the first time I ever met Janelle Monáe. Thankfully, not later when I had corner"
01:22:40;01:22:43;"bistro. We were at some hotel and I was like, all these people are sitting around. I'm like,"
01:22:43;01:22:49;"you know, let me loosen up meeting people for the first time. Young man in downtown"
01:22:49;01:22:53;"Manhattan. So I remember I like drank one. Then I drank another one. I was like, life's"
01:22:53;01:22:56;"great. Life's great. I found my drink. And then this is where I know I really made a"
01:22:56;01:23:00;"mistake. I feel like my final count might have been like five, but they're in such quick"
01:23:00;01:23:05;"succession. Is that just pure vodka? Right. I think so. With like olive juice. I think"
01:23:05;01:23:12;"I was doing gin ones. But yes, yes. Vermouth gin. And so I remember maybe after two and"
01:23:12;01:23:18;"I'm just like, I feel great just hanging out. And I was like, you know what? I'm a drinker,"
01:23:18;01:23:22;"man. And so this is where I knew I really messed up. This is classic hubristic. This"
01:23:22;01:23:28;"is such hubris. And I remember that the waiter came back and I was like, let me get to I"
01:23:28;01:23:33;"was like, because I'm throwing these back so fast. I was so stupid. So I care. I know."
01:23:33;01:23:36;"But you know, you sometimes you got to go down some dark paths to find out who you really"
01:23:36;01:23:40;"are. And then I feel like maybe I had four in quick succession at whatever hotel we're"
01:23:40;01:23:45;"at. And then some other group peeled off to go to corner bistro. I'm like, that's good."
01:23:45;01:23:49;"The place is famous for its burgers. Yeah. Definitely is a burger. Just slammed four."
01:23:49;01:23:53;"But I'm still feeling good. Then I feel like I sat down there, probably ordered another"
01:23:53;01:23:57;"drink. And then I just remember like taking a bite and just being like, Oh yeah. And just"
01:23:57;01:24:00;"running to the bathroom. Just like puking. So was that night. It was like an hour later."
01:24:00;01:24:05;"Yeah. I feel like it was such a quick turnaround. And then I was just like, I'll never do this"
01:24:05;01:24:10;"again. Not a drinker. You're like, Janelle, I got to go. Yeah. No, luckily she didn't"
01:24:10;01:24:13;"come to corner bistro. Can you just come back out to hang out with Janelle? Your eyes are"
01:24:13;01:24:18;"all red. Yeah. Face is all puffy. I feel like she wasn't even drinking. I was just trying"
01:24:18;01:24:22;"to be a cool guy. Just slamming dirty martinis. I wasn't just trying to be cool. I legitimately"
01:24:22;01:24:28;"was enjoying drinking them and being like, Oh, this is what it's like to be a drinker."
01:24:28;01:24:33;"So that's unusual that this late. I mean, surely, you know, it happens every few years."
01:24:33;01:24:36;"Did you do beer before liquor? Yeah. It was like, we're having a big party at our house."
01:24:36;01:24:40;"No, but liquor before beer, you're in the clear. I don't think that's true. You didn't"
01:24:40;01:24:44;"know that at a certain quantity. It doesn't matter, dude. Just a lot of beer and tequila"
01:24:44;01:24:49;"over like a six hour period. Went to bed, felt great. Woke up at like eight, felt pretty"
01:24:49;01:24:54;"good. Yeah. Pop some Advil, went back to sleep, woke up at 10 30 and I was like, Ooh, clean"
01:24:54;01:24:58;"the place up. Went to breakfast. When did you have coffee? Didn't do coffee until the"
01:24:58;01:25:04;"breakfast did a Coke on ice. Oh yeah. That's classic hungover. Yeah. Carbonation. This"
01:25:04;01:25:10;"is such like, this is very unusual. Yeah. Like Fred, bro, bro. I'm with you. Four shots"
01:25:10;01:25:15;"of Jaeger. No, but I know that actually reminds me so much of being in college. It's before"
01:25:15;01:25:20;"I was like a hardcore Java hound. I knew that I liked coffee, but it was still kind of hit"
01:25:20;01:25:24;"or miss. Like occasionally I'd walk past like a street cart on my way to like my seminar"
01:25:24;01:25:28;"and just be like, Oh, let me get like a, a regular coffee. And this is, you know, New"
01:25:28;01:25:32;"Yorker, they just put like milk and sugar and just, and I was just kind of like, Oh,"
01:25:32;01:25:37;"yeah, light, sweet. And so I knew I liked coffee, but it wasn't that it wasn't like,"
01:25:37;01:25:42;"you know, now just like every morning my coffee, the coffee before the coffee vibe. Yeah. But"
01:25:42;01:25:46;"I totally remember that feeling of waking up like super hungover today. My body would"
01:25:46;01:25:50;"just be like, go get a coffee. But then just like rolling up to like the Seinfeld diner,"
01:25:50;01:25:54;"you know, that was like one of our go-to's and just be like, Oh, let me get a grilled"
01:25:54;01:25:59;"cheese with a pickle, a side of mashed potatoes and grape, like some weird ass thing. Oh, and"
01:25:59;01:26:04;"a Coke on ice. That was such like a young hungover thing. And then go back and be like,"
01:26:04;01:26:08;"all right, I feel okay. Now go back to my room, sleep for four hours. I hadn't pulled"
01:26:08;01:26:12;"that move in years, but I was thankful that there was some soda on the house. So then"
01:26:12;01:26:17;"you get down to the diner, one bite of French toast. And I was like, luckily no one was"
01:26:17;01:26:22;"in the bathroom. This should be the sequel to mountain Bruce. Mountain Bruce is like"
01:26:22;01:26:26;"you're you went for a hike? No. After that I went and worked on mountain Bruce. Oh really?"
01:26:26;01:26:33;"Yeah. You just wrote like, it's like a minor key. Sunday morning. Why don't I go for a"
01:26:33;01:26:42;"hike? Sunday morning. Why don't we go for a hike? Was it Morrissey? Jonathan Richmond"
01:26:42;01:26:53;"version. Actually this is like Scott Walker. I just threw up at Coco's please Jake come"
01:26:53;01:27:00;"out for a hike. I will not go for a hike. Yeah. That's home. Bruce. I'm going back to"
01:27:00;01:27:05;"bed. I've got a Modelo on the nightstand. That's what you're so hung over that you got"
01:27:05;01:27:09;"a Modelo on the nightstand. All the shades are drawn. You're just like streaming some"
01:27:09;01:27:14;"**** on your laptop in bed. Brutal. Yeah. Mountain Bruce is like that's that perfect"
01:27:14;01:27:18;"amount of hung over. Yeah. Mountain Bruce is a bummer. This is where you can't shake"
01:27:18;01:27:25;"the cobwebs free. You've succumbed to the cobwebs. Oh yeah. The number four song. The"
01:27:25;01:27:38;"number four song 1972. Helen Reddy, I am woman. Is this a country song? Is this I am woman"
01:27:38;01:27:53;"hear me roar? Is this how it goes? Oh yeah. So she's Australian. So this is Australian"
01:27:53;01:28:19;"country. Yes. I am wise. But it's wisdom for the pain. Yes I paid the price. But look how"
01:28:19;01:28:26;"I am ready. Sounds very interesting. Ready denied cores in 2003 from using I am woman"
01:28:26;01:28:31;"in an advertisement saying I'm not in the drug dealing business. I don't care how much"
01:28:31;01:28:39;"money they offer me. Whoa. Harsh words about alcohol. And then in 2006 Burger King featured"
01:28:39;01:28:47;"a lyrically adjusted version of I am woman called I am man for a commercial titled mantham"
01:28:47;01:28:51;"which compared the Texas double whopper to chick food and ending with eat like a man"
01:28:51;01:28:58;"man. Wow. That's when you realize things have really changed. What year was that? Oh six."
01:28:58;01:29:05;"Let's take this song that has sort of a political valence to it. A feminist viewpoint. And let's"
01:29:05;01:29:11;"rewrite it so it has the exact opposite meaning. Yeah. Will you sell that to us? It's so petty"
01:29:11;01:29:18;"too. That's so gnarly. Well I think this is a I am man. Hear me roar in numbers too big"
01:29:18;01:29:24;"to ignore. And I'm way too hungry to settle for. OK. Just to paint a picture. She sold"
01:29:24;01:29:31;"it. Yeah. Maybe she's like alcohol. No. Some weird kind of massage in his burgers. OK."
01:29:31;01:29:36;"But in this commercial the guy sitting at kind of like a fancy restaurant with his girlfriend"
01:29:36;01:29:40;"and he gets up from the table and he's like I don't know if he's talking about salads"
01:29:40;01:29:44;"or something. I'm way too hungry to settle for chick food. This is funny because 2006"
01:29:44;01:29:49;"was still a little bit before Jesus the time when like before paleo and stuff when there"
01:29:49;01:29:54;"was kind of like almost like a tough guy way to be obsessed with your diet. We're now like"
01:29:54;01:30:00;"a tough guy might be like yeah I'm vegan. I find that my muscle tone is more defined"
01:30:00;01:30:05;"if I'm vegan between 9 a.m. and noon. Yes sometimes I will eat a salad for lunch then"
01:30:05;01:30:09;"I'll have like organics. You know. Yeah. This is before that. This is still just like real"
01:30:09;01:30:16;"men crush brews and eat burgers. My stomach's starting to growl and I'm going on the prowl"
01:30:16;01:30:25;"for a pure beef double whopper man that's good. Oh yes. I'm a guy. I'll admit I've been"
01:30:25;01:30:33;"fed. Keshe. Wait. Bye bye. Now it's for the purest beef I reach. I will eat this meat."
01:30:33;01:30:43;"It's not even pure beef. Oh God. I am in cordial. I am in cordial. 100 percent pure beef flame"
01:30:43;01:30:51;"grill good thing. Now they're pushing a car. They're pushing a car off a bridge. This is"
01:30:51;01:30:58;"a straight up television ad for Burger King. And why do they keep saying I am incorrigible."
01:30:58;01:31:04;"This feels like this is written by somebody who hates men. This is like a stubborn I'm"
01:31:04;01:31:09;"incorrigible means like you can't be correct. You can't be like a child is incorrigible."
01:31:09;01:31:16;"I am incorrigible. I am. That's a big word for a Burger King. Yeah. Like so many people"
01:31:16;01:31:20;"are like what are you. Yeah. This came out in the same year that Trump introduced Bob"
01:31:20;01:31:26;"Weir. Oh yeah. Dark days. Oh six big year. But in my neighborhood my neighbor we were"
01:31:26;01:31:35;"still scarfing down burgers. Email from the Beto campaign subject line incorrigible. I"
01:31:35;01:31:40;"can't believe that happened. Also it's not that well known of a song. The percentage"
01:31:40;01:31:45;"of people watching that ad that understood the reference maybe 5 percent. It kind of"
01:31:45;01:31:49;"seems like a psyops campaign. I think that was a well known song in the 60s probably"
01:31:49;01:31:55;"more meaningful to 72. 72 right. Probably more meaningful to women because it was written"
01:31:55;01:32:02;"as kind of an anthem for women. So then you get a picture like oh my God dude in 2006"
01:32:02;01:32:06;"who like or maybe they figured you know what man it's just it's a funny song even if you"
01:32:06;01:32:12;"don't get the reference or just man like a true OG feminist from the 60s and 70s and"
01:32:12;01:32:19;"then smash cut to 2006 or driving around town that comes on. No I guess it's on the TV."
01:32:19;01:32:23;"Right. They're watching Fox News. This is meant to play in a commercial break for the"
01:32:23;01:32:30;"man show. I oh yeah. This is peak man show. Oh right. Right. Culture. We got to get Jimmy"
01:32:30;01:32:37;"Kimmel on. Absolutely. I am incorrigible. The number four song right now. Twenty nineteen"
01:32:37;01:32:43;"juice world and young boy never broke again. Bandit. I got to say young boy never broke"
01:32:43;01:32:48;"again is definitely the best name of any rapper of the past five years. Yeah. One thing that's"
01:32:48;01:32:53;"also cool about it is young boy is one word and everything else is it'd be that'd be crazy."
01:32:53;01:32:58;"Actually I might suggest if I may put a space between young and boy just a full five word"
01:32:58;01:33:04;"name. Young boy never broke again. This juice world and YB NBA which is I think how it's"
01:33:04;01:33:19;"often shortened. It's called bandit. Poor Juice WRLD is getting sued by a lot of people."
01:33:19;01:33:23;"Why. He had this big hit lucid dreams which samples sting. He cleared the sting sample"
01:33:23;01:33:29;"but now the pop punk band yellow card is suing him. Oh no. I say I don't need no molly to"
01:33:29;01:33:38;"be savage. When I'm on that molly I feel savage. Incorrigible. I'm the definition of a bandit."
01:33:38;01:33:42;"I don't need no molly to be savage. Juice WRLD was not allowed to listen to rap as a"
01:33:42;01:33:46;"child but he was allowed to listen to rock and pop music he found on video games such"
01:33:46;01:33:50;"as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Guitar Hero introducing him to artists such as Billy Idol"
01:33:50;01:33:57;"Blink 182 Black Sabbath Fall Out Boy Megadeth and Panic at the Disco. Megadeth is deep."
01:33:57;01:34:01;"I loved Guitar Hero when that first came out. I think Vampire Weekend was eventually in"
01:34:01;01:34:05;"Guitar Hero but maybe eventually everything like you could just buy any song you wanted"
01:34:05;01:34:10;"for Guitar Hero but we were definitely in this game called Just Dance 2 which actually"
01:34:10;01:34:15;"any TC heads who first heard Vampire Weekend from Just Dance 2 hit us up because you know"
01:34:15;01:34:20;"this is back in the day you get these like hilariously bad deals for video games but"
01:34:20;01:34:23;"you'd kind of just be like well whatever maybe don't introduce people to the music because"
01:34:23;01:34:28;"you'd be like you know you get an advance of like 200 bucks and a per unit royalty of"
01:34:28;01:34:33;".000 and you'd just be kind of like alright whatever. You'd kind of expect you'd never"
01:34:33;01:34:37;"get a check and then I remember like a few years later like the label was like got a"
01:34:37;01:34:41;"decent check off Just Dance 2 and we're like really? We never get video game checks and"
01:34:41;01:34:46;"they're like it became one of the best selling games of the decade. And still you know we"
01:34:46;01:34:49;"get this tiny royalty it's not like we raked it in or anything but I just remember being"
01:34:49;01:34:53;"like oh damn like so probably millions of people heard us for the first time in that"
01:34:53;01:34:59;"video game but then I haven't heard about it lately. Back to 1972 the number 3 song"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"is The Spinners I'll Be Around."
01:35:01;01:35:19;"Classic. Oh yeah. So cool. Little harpsichord. Is that harpsichord? It might just be the"
01:35:19;01:35:24;"guitar. But doubling the guitar for the lower thing? Sounds like a keyboard. It could be"
01:35:24;01:35:32;"a clav maybe. That classic blending. You gotta get to the bottom of that Billy Joel arrangement."
01:35:32;01:35:33;"Right."
01:35:33;01:36:01;"That's a cool song."
01:36:01;01:36:29;"That super prominent hand drum in the left ear."
01:36:29;01:36:51;"It doesn't change at all does it? Yeah the groove. Except for the I'll be around. Oh"
01:36:51;01:37:03;"yeah. But yeah the groove very constant. That bass is crazy. That's gotta be one of these"
01:37:03;01:37:11;"like famous session basses. Just like so confident. Great bass line. Great arrangement. Back to"
01:37:11;01:37:17;"our day 2019. I feel like we haven't actually heard this one maybe once. Post Malone Circles."
01:37:17;01:37:27;"I'm not supposed to. I just can't stop making hits. I've been hearing this one around. This"
01:37:27;01:37:46;"one's a little indie. A little Mac DeMarco. A little Blind Melon. A little jangly. Turn"
01:37:46;01:37:50;"it up. Post Malone's Bud Light Bar Dive Tour where he debuted this song he said it's a"
01:37:50;01:37:54;"little f***ing different. It's got a f***ing fat groove. Post Malone is currently being"
01:37:54;01:38:00;"featured on cans of Bud Light which are currently on sale in 15 cities in Texas. Malone called"
01:38:00;01:38:05;"the cans f***ing epic. That's tight. Post was cool selling to the drug industry. Oh"
01:38:05;01:38:10;"yeah. Post Malone and Helen Reddy very different artists. Oh yeah. Yeah this is a good song."
01:38:10;01:38:16;"You know who talked s*** about Budweiser on this very show? Huey Lewis. That's true. It's"
01:38:16;01:38:22;"like Budweiser sucks. I was surprised by that. Does Budweiser suck? You drink beer Jake."
01:38:22;01:38:27;"You're a real beer drinker. I'm more of a martini guy. Right. You know I'm kind of off"
01:38:27;01:38:34;"the bud. It's real like in your 20s. Yeah. I'm more on the Pacifico, Modelo. Okay what's"
01:38:34;01:38:40;"your favorite American beer? Great question. Maybe like a Lagunitas. You know what? Sierra"
01:38:40;01:38:44;"Nevada. Actually I want to get back on this. That says on the show that I want to try to"
01:38:44;01:38:48;"get Mountain Brews a sink. Like for Sierra Nevada or something? Yeah but I also have"
01:38:48;01:38:54;"another idea that's like we go straight to Jake and you do a campaign for like Modelo"
01:38:54;01:39:00;"or Pacifico or something or Corona and it's like a picture of you like in your studio."
01:39:00;01:39:04;"Yeah actually it's a Norman Rockwell painting of you painting a Jake Longstreth painting"
01:39:04;01:39:11;"and reaching for Pacifico and says this is like Mad Men era type print advertising. American"
01:39:11;01:39:20;"painter. Mexican beer. Wow. Sierra Nevada I am available. Sierra Nevada is American?"
01:39:20;01:39:25;"Yes. Out of Chico, California. Okay so they can have Mountain Brews in their commercial."
01:39:25;01:39:29;"I mean it's Sierra Nevada. It's like Mountain Brews is perfect for that. Right and then"
01:39:29;01:39:33;"one of the Mexican beers can have my print campaign. Yes. American painter Mexican beer."
01:39:33;01:39:40;"Open for biz. You know when we were in Colorado when we were ending that tour in Colorado"
01:39:40;01:39:44;"at some point we were like driving around and people were talking about times they'd"
01:39:44;01:39:48;"been to like breweries or something in Colorado and at some point somebody was like what's"
01:39:48;01:39:52;"the story with Coors? Like do you think it's still American owned or something? And then"
01:39:52;01:39:56;"I looked it up and like I don't know if it's still like if he's the CEO or just the chairman"
01:39:56;01:40:01;"but it's like Ted Coors or something is still like big in the company. Really? An actual"
01:40:01;01:40:06;"Coors. So it hasn't been sold to like InBev or whatever? It didn't seem to. But at the"
01:40:06;01:40:12;"very least there's still Coors family representation in the company. That's nice. Here's another"
01:40:12;01:40:20;"idea. Spinoff of Succession. Succession colon Coors. You could do so many Succession spinoffs"
01:40:20;01:40:26;"about just like real companies. Yeah. The Coors family fortune. Taco Bell Succession."
01:40:26;01:40:30;"What was the guy's name? Glenn. Glenn Bell. Glenn Bell. Oh yeah like a period piece. It's"
01:40:30;01:40:35;"set in the 70s. Yeah. Dad's thinking about selling to PepsiCo. The three Bell children."
01:40:35;01:40:42;"You know like there's like the Kendall who's like wants to keep the company, wants to take"
01:40:42;01:40:47;"over. Yeah. Then there's like the Roman who's just like sell to PepsiCo. Yeah. They have"
01:40:47;01:40:53;"the network. They have the infrastructure, the capital. And then Shiv is vegan. Shiv"
01:40:53;01:40:59;"is a vegan activist and then she comes back in. She starts Del Taco, rival chain. Yeah."
01:40:59;01:41:05;"Which initially vegetarian. Quickly sold out though. Shiv is tour managing Morrissey and"
01:41:05;01:41:14;"she's vegan. She brokers a sit down between Glenn Bell and Morrissey. Back to 1972 the"
01:41:14;01:41:21;"number three song then Lobo. I'd love you to want me now. I know I want you to want"
01:41:21;01:41:26;"me. The album is called Of a Simple Man. Who is Lobo? Are they country? I'm thinking of"
01:41:26;01:41:36;"country rock. Well there's Poco is country rock. Lobo I think is also sort of like poppy."
01:41:36;01:41:42;"Lobo is a person. His real name is Roland Kent Lavoie. Oh Lavoie began his music career"
01:41:42;01:41:50;"as a member of the Rumors. The band included Graham Parsons and Jim Stafford. It's a little"
01:41:50;01:41:57;"more of like a Brad vibe. Oh this is I'd love you to want me. It's so early 70s. It's also"
01:41:57;01:42:05;"very we had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun. Who's that? Terry Jax. Deep."
01:42:06;01:42:19;"What you tried so not to show. Something in my soul just cries. Actually this sounds like"
01:42:19;01:42:22;"it'd be in a Burger King commercial. You know what I mean? Like there's that era of Burger"
01:42:22;01:42:29;"King commercials that are all 70s music. Ooh that's real Eagles though. Yeah. Yeah this"
01:42:29;01:42:36;"is a Burger King commercial from 2006. A guy's about to marry a vegan chick and then his"
01:42:36;01:42:45;"groomsmen rush him out of there to the nearest Burger King. She's crying. All the people"
01:42:45;01:42:49;"at the wedding are like what the f***. It's like in slow motion. He just like jumps over"
01:42:49;01:42:55;"the cake and like smashes it. He's just like chowing down on the double whopper. Cause"
01:42:55;01:43:07;"you're a f***ing man. You'd never let your feelings show. The obligation that you made."
01:43:07;01:43:13;"You know this kind of has like a um. All I want is the air that I breathe. Oh yeah Hollies"
01:43:13;01:43:21;"yeah. I'm actually feeling this song. Oh yeah it's great. I'd love you to want me. The way"
01:43:21;01:43:33;"that I want you. The way that it should be. Baby. You'd love me to want you. The way that"
01:43:33;01:43:45;"I want to. Yeah this is a beautiful song. Great palette. Tasteful. Ooh get it. Seinfeld"
01:43:45;01:43:50;"can you get a number crunch that's ever been in a commercial? Has Cheap Trick covered this"
01:43:50;01:43:55;"song? Well they have. I want you to want me. It's a different song. They have I want you"
01:43:55;01:44:00;"to want me. Cause that was in a Diet Coke commercial. Also has like a Bee Gees feel."
01:44:00;01:44:06;"Yeah this is beautiful. This is a beautiful song. This could be a Cat Stevens song too."
01:44:06;01:44:18;"Very different vocal but kind of wild world vibe. I see the want in your blue eyes. Baby."
01:44:18;01:44:28;"I'd love you to want me. The way that I want you. I think the car manufacturer Isuzu. Isuzu?"
01:44:28;01:44:41;"Oh wait. No I spoke too soon. My bad. I'd love an Isuzu. Would you like an Isuzu? Oh"
01:44:41;01:44:48;"wait wait wait. What is it Tata Indica? What is that? Wait Tata there's the Indian car"
01:44:48;01:44:54;"manufacturer. So they used this song in one of their first ads. Oh okay. The Tata family"
01:44:54;01:45:01;"is one of the richest families in India. Oh deep. Succession colon Tata. Now the number"
01:45:01;01:45:08;"two song back in 2019. Tones and I. Okay new artist alert. This is the Isuzu new artist"
01:45:08;01:45:16;"alert. Every time we get an artist we've never talked about on Time Crisis. Isuzu will donate"
01:45:16;01:45:22;"seventy five dollars to a children's hospital. So Tones and I. The song's called Dance Monkey."
01:45:22;01:45:27;"Tones and I aka Tony Watson is a singer songwriter from Victoria Australia on a trip to Byron"
01:45:27;01:45:34;"Bay in early 2019. She took a chance at busking which was successful. Early 2018. Early 2018."
01:45:34;01:45:38;"When she returned from Byron Bay she quit her retail job to pursue a full time music"
01:45:38;01:45:44;"career. We want to hear more about this retail job. This is also just like very 2019. Back"
01:45:44;01:45:51;"in 1972 if your name was Tony Watson he would be like amazing name. You must be a pop star."
01:45:51;01:45:58;"Whereas today. I don't know the gender. Tony Watson has to become Tones and I. One more"
01:45:58;01:46:02;"thing about the Elton John book. It's also funny to think like I kind of get it but it's"
01:46:02;01:46:05;"a major turning point in his life where he changed his name to Elton John. That's actually"
01:46:05;01:46:09;"a pretty funny story. So his real name is Reginald Dwight. And he was just like he's"
01:46:09;01:46:14;"like Reg Dwight man. Such a shitty name. I can never be a pop star called Reg Dwight."
01:46:14;01:46:18;"And I'm just kind of like all right. I don't know why not. And then he was in another band"
01:46:18;01:46:22;"and he just had this turning point on tour where he's just like I'm sick of this. He's"
01:46:22;01:46:25;"like I got to get out on my own. He looks around in the van or whatever. One of the"
01:46:25;01:46:30;"guys names Elton another guy's name is John. He's like I'm gonna be Elton John. No way."
01:46:30;01:46:35;"And they're just like dude. Get out of here. Get the f*** out of here Reg. And then he"
01:46:35;01:46:44;"became Elton John. Oh my God. That's so funny. My solo artist name is Jake Seinfeld."
01:46:44;01:46:51;"So anyway here's Tones and I with their new hit Dance Monkey. This went number one in Australia."
01:47:25;01:47:29;"Her vocal style is very influenced by Sia right. Good call."
01:47:35;01:47:37;"Is she going to say monkey in the song?"
01:47:56;01:47:59;"I guess Dance Monkey's not in the chorus. Just dance for me?"
01:48:21;01:48:24;"So she's a monkey trainer in the song right?"
01:48:24;01:48:25;"She's talking to the monkey?"
01:48:25;01:48:26;"She's the monkey."
01:48:26;01:48:29;"Wait because somebody's telling her to dance?"
01:48:29;01:48:32;"Yes. I thought she was a monkey trainer."
01:48:32;01:48:34;"No she used to work retail."
01:48:34;01:48:36;"Oh that's right. That's right. I missed that."
01:48:36;01:48:40;"When she returned from Brian Bray she quit her job as a monkey trainer."
01:48:40;01:48:44;"Well Tones and I you're off to a great start. Number one in Australia. Welcome to the jungle."
01:48:44;01:48:47;"One week short of finishing her degree in zoology."
01:48:47;01:48:52;"All right shout out to Tones and I. It's nice to get some new blood in the top five. I mean"
01:48:52;01:48:57;"no disrespect but Post Malone, Justin Bieber, I feel like we've been talking about these guys for years."
01:48:57;01:48:59;"Kind of old hat at this point."
01:48:59;01:49:03;"Johnny Nash number two 1972. Oh no number one actually."
01:49:03;01:49:04;"God 72 is crushing."
01:49:04;01:49:09;"Yeah 70. This has been a particularly good 70s one. Johnny Nash I can see clearly now. Great song."
01:49:09;01:49:13;"This is the first reggae song to ever hit number one on the Hot 100."
01:49:13;01:49:20;"Although Johnny Nash is from Texas but whatever he went to Jamaica to record the song and this is a reggae song."
01:49:20;01:49:26;"And then in the 90s Jimmy Cliff recorded a version for the film Cool Runnings. That's a good movie."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"And he had another hit with it."
01:49:28;01:49:34;"I love that Johnny Nash is from Texas."
01:49:34;01:49:38;"I can see clearly now the rain is gone."
01:49:38;01:49:46;"I can see all obstacles in my way."
01:49:49;01:49:52;"I literally thought of this as a reggae song."
01:49:52;01:49:53;"It's not too..."
01:49:53;01:49:54;"It's not like..."
01:49:54;01:49:56;"But it is the groove."
01:49:56;01:49:57;"Yeah for sure."
01:49:57;01:50:00;"He's got such a beautiful voice. Such a great vocal performance."
01:50:01;01:50:08;"It's gonna be a bright bright bright sunshiny day."
01:50:08;01:50:16;"I think I can make it now the pain is gone."
01:50:16;01:50:23;"All of the bad feelings have disappeared."
01:50:23;01:50:26;"I bet Paul Simon liked this song."
01:50:26;01:50:30;"I think this is still after Mother and Child Reunion."
01:50:30;01:50:33;"I think it's like two years later."
01:50:33;01:50:36;"I guess Mother and Child Reunion didn't go to number one."
01:50:36;01:50:48;"This part is not very reggae."
01:50:55;01:51:00;"I wonder if he recorded the rhythm tracks in Jamaica and then brought this back to LA."
01:51:00;01:51:02;"Like Capitol Studios and they..."
01:51:02;01:51:04;"Somebody over-tugged all the horns."
01:51:04;01:51:10;"That part's crazy."
01:51:10;01:51:12;"It's funny. This is one of those songs..."
01:51:12;01:51:14;"Of course I know the verse so well."
01:51:14;01:51:19;"I couldn't have given you that bridge if you paid me."
01:51:21;01:51:25;"I can see all obstacles in my way."
01:51:25;01:51:27;"Weird synth in there."
01:51:27;01:51:29;"Yeah, cool fuzz."
01:51:29;01:51:33;"Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind."
01:51:33;01:51:34;"Oh yeah."
01:51:34;01:51:35;"Like a mood or..."
01:51:35;01:51:36;"Yeah yeah."
01:51:36;01:51:39;"Bright bright bright sunshiny day."
01:51:39;01:51:42;"Johnny Nash. Straight out of Texas."
01:51:42;01:51:46;"The number one song right now on the Billboard Hot 100"
01:51:46;01:51:50;"is that new-ish Travis Scott ""Highest in the Room""."
01:51:50;01:51:52;"You've heard this once, right?"
01:51:52;01:51:53;"Oh yeah."
01:51:53;01:52:11;"Damn, Travis Scott hurt himself performing at the Rolling Loud Festival in Queens."
01:52:11;01:52:12;"He seriously injured his knee."
01:52:12;01:52:16;"And he's on stage and said, ""I think I just broke my knee right now, but the show cannot stop."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"Nothing can ever stop this show."""
01:52:18;01:52:21;"And he performed the final song with a knee brace."
01:52:21;01:52:22;"Jesus."
01:52:22;01:52:25;"Don't want to laugh at a guy's injury, but..."
01:52:25;01:52:26;"Knee braces."
01:52:26;01:52:27;"That's hardcore."
01:52:27;01:52:29;"Would you continue the show?"
01:52:29;01:52:31;"If I broke my knee?"
01:52:31;01:52:33;"I don't think so."
01:52:33;01:52:35;"I still think it's gotta be so painful."
01:52:35;01:52:36;"Yeah."
01:52:36;01:52:38;"God, it's so painful."
01:52:38;01:52:41;"Waves crashing on the beach."
01:52:41;01:52:43;"Yeah, this is a good song."
01:52:43;01:52:45;"I've heard it enough that I feel like I know it now."
01:52:45;01:52:47;"Jake, you ever been the highest in the room?"
01:52:47;01:52:49;"No, I'm not much of a weed guy."
01:52:49;01:52:51;"You ever been the drunkest in the room?"
01:52:51;01:52:53;"I don't know."
01:52:53;01:52:54;"Probably."
01:52:54;01:52:57;"It's funny, like..."
01:52:57;01:52:58;"Not very often, though."
01:52:58;01:53:01;"It'd be so much harsher if it was called ""drunkest in the room""."
01:53:01;01:53:06;"Like, being the highest in the room, obviously the word ""high"", there's the double meaning of it."
01:53:06;01:53:11;"So it kind of... to be like very high is also to be exalted or whatever."
01:53:11;01:53:15;"And yet, being the highest in the room is like, ""Whoa, maybe you're seeing things other people aren't seeing."""
01:53:15;01:53:17;"You're on some other plane, dude."
01:53:17;01:53:21;"But it's like, ""Get out of here. I'm the drunkest in the room."""
01:53:21;01:53:23;"That's just so embarrassing."
01:53:23;01:53:25;"Jesus, dude. Keep it together."
01:53:25;01:53:26;"Yeah."
01:53:26;01:53:29;"Yo, can you guys get Travis out of here?"
01:53:29;01:53:31;"He's being super loud."
01:53:31;01:53:32;"He's sh*t-faced."
01:53:32;01:53:35;"No, don't get me wrong. He's a sweetheart when he's drunk."
01:53:35;01:53:38;"I mean, just a gem of a guy, but man, his energy."
01:53:38;01:53:40;"""I'm the drunkest in the room."""
01:53:40;01:53:42;"Dude, it's 3 in the morning."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"I think he's gonna throw up soon."
01:53:44;01:53:45;"Yeah."

01:54:38;01:54:39;"No, it's gang vocals."

01:54:43;01:54:45;"Some dialogue at the beginning."
01:54:45;01:54:49;"Oh my god."

01:55:07;01:55:10;"Also, you know there's that whole-"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"This is a real boozy."
01:55:12;01:55:13;"Yeah, that's true."

01:55:16;01:55:18;"""I'm the drunkest in the room."""
01:55:18;01:55:20;"It also-"
01:55:20;01:55:21;"That is so harsh."
01:55:21;01:55:27;"There's that whole genre of video, some of which are surprisingly well made, where it's"
01:55:27;01:55:32;"like the school or the class or the company does their parody song."
01:55:32;01:55:35;"You definitely see some of those on Catatonic Youth."
01:55:35;01:55:36;"Oh yeah."
01:55:36;01:55:37;"Which I think you showed me."
01:55:37;01:55:41;"But there's so many of those, and there's one that somebody showed me from- that was"
01:55:41;01:55:46;"posted on the Catatonic Youth's great account that was a bunch of real estate agents in"
01:55:46;01:55:47;"Denver."
01:55:47;01:55:50;"Maybe it's just because the last US trip, I keep referring back to our Red Rocks trip,"
01:55:50;01:55:53;"but I just remember walking around Denver and I couldn't get it out of my head where it's"
01:55:53;01:55:56;"like it's a Fresh Prince parody and it's all the real estate agents out there."
01:55:56;01:56:00;"It's like, ""Well, this is a story all about how the real estate market turned upside down."""

01:56:17;01:56:18;"Yeah, let's hear that."
01:56:18;01:56:20;"Oh yeah, it's super office."
01:56:20;01:56:23;"There's a lot of pushback I guess, because they deleted it maybe because people were"

01:56:31;01:56:32;"I've had a lot of questions about that."
01:56:32;01:56:34;"Yeah, because it's just like in Silver Lake or something."
01:56:34;01:56:38;"Well, and it's paid for by the AHF, which is an AIDS organization."
01:56:38;01:56:42;"So it's not exactly like on message, but there's a whole lot of interesting stuff about that"

01:59:20;01:59:21;"Change their policies."
01:59:21;01:59:26;"Cause I've never heard of a major real estate agent company in like a big city"
01:59:26;01:59:30;"like that, who doesn't love gentrification, love the chance to sell more luxury condos."
01:59:30;01:59:31;"Okay."

01:59:44;01:59:49;"arrested for weed is like still super out of whack, but it's legal."
01:59:49;01:59:50;"Oh, we'd totally legal in Colorado."
