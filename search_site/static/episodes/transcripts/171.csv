00:00;00:10;"Time Crisis, back again. On this week's episode, we're joined by longtime friend and legendary"
00:10;00:20;"guest Bruce Hornsby to talk about our new song. We'll also talk about Kenny G, Carl's Jr.,"
00:20;00:30;"Horse Meat, Venison, and so much more. This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:37;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:43;00:50;"They were a pal to a belief, all my rightful chances"
00:50;00:57;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:57;01:04;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:04;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:15;01:19;"He's the lonely man"
01:19;01:27;"Time Crisis, back again. We're here to kick off episode two of our year-long Horse Meat special."
01:27;01:29;"[Horse neighing]"
01:29;01:39;"The story of the horse started early April 22, we're wrapping up March 23."
01:39;01:45;"No, but seriously, we've been hearing great things about the Horse Meat episode, which is the last episode if you're just tuning in now."
01:45;01:47;"How you doing, Jake?"
01:47;01:49;"Doing well, thank you. How are you?"
01:49;01:52;"Not bad. Have you had any personal conversations about horse meat?"
01:52;01:53;"None."
01:53;01:59;"I bring it up to people sometimes. Well, first of all, people keep talking about this restaurant, Horses in LA."
01:59;02:05;"There's also a new show on Apple TV called Slow Horses that I've been hearing about."
02:05;02:06;"Slow Cooked Horses?"
02:06;02:11;"I think it's a cooking show. It's just out there in the atmosphere. It's having a moment."
02:11;02:14;"Have you been to Horses in LA?"
02:14;02:16;"No, I haven't been to Horses. Have you?"
02:16;02:24;"LA's hottest restaurant? No, I mean, I don't think I could get in. It's a restaurant out of a Bret Easton Ellis novel in the 80s."
02:24;02:25;"It's that hot?"
02:25;02:28;"How'd you get reservations? I think it's that hot."
02:28;02:32;"All right, maybe we can do the Time Crisis Christmas Party 2023 there."
02:32;02:38;"If we ask nicely now, try to get that res about 20 months in advance."
02:38;02:41;"Well, maybe we have Apple throw its weight around."
02:41;02:45;"Oh, yeah, well, Apple makes slow horses and they're horses, so why not?"
02:45;02:51;"The type of horse meat conversations that I have lately, now that I've pitched my horse meat restaurants to..."
02:51;02:58;"I mean, there is like a type of guy who if I'm talking to and they're like in the investment or financial world, I will..."
02:58;03:01;"or they make any reference to having invested in a restaurant."
03:01;03:04;"I kind of can't help myself. I have to dryly pivot to..."
03:04;03:07;"You know, I actually have a business plan for a restaurant group."
03:07;03:09;"And this guy's like, ""Oh, really?"""
03:09;03:11;"And then I start saying, and then it's like, ""Are you serious?"""
03:11;03:12;"And say, ""Yeah."""
03:12;03:14;"And then they're, ""Really?"""
03:14;03:18;"And say, ""Well, the good thing about this is I don't have to admit that I'm not serious."""
03:18;03:27;"I can just say, ""Well, the thing is, you know, Joe Biden helped to make horse meat very difficult in the US, so it's really not possible right now, but, you know, could use
some help."""
03:27;03:29;"So is it a realistic idea right now?"
03:29;03:30;"Maybe not."
03:30;03:36;"Your life sounds like it's so Larry David and curb, like just talking to people who are restaurant investors."
03:36;03:37;"Yeah, basically."
03:37;03:39;"Come on, invest in the restaurant."
03:39;03:41;"I have a pretty curb-esque life."
03:41;03:45;"I mean, I do work a bit, but I try to have a retired mentality."
03:45;03:46;"I love it."
03:46;03:50;"You know, I still go to the studio making a record, but I look at that as a hobby."
03:50;03:53;"Well, you're investing in restaurants. I mean, I think it's really..."
03:53;03:56;"I'm not investing in restaurants. I'm talking to... I'm having conversations."
03:56;03:57;"You're talking to people that..."
03:57;03:59;"I'm making small talk with restauranteurs."
03:59;04:01;"I don't think I've ever met a restauranteur."
04:01;04:02;"Really?"
04:02;04:06;"Have you met any, or do you ever socialize with hoteliers?"
04:06;04:10;"I've met hoteliers. I wouldn't count any of them in my good friends."
04:10;04:15;"I mean, you know everybody who's my good friend, but you get to two, three degrees further away."
04:15;04:17;"I've sat down with the hotelier."
04:17;04:20;"Do you have any hoteliers in your phone?"
04:20;04:23;"In my phone? No, not in my phone."
04:23;04:26;"I could think of like two or three... No, I could think of two."
04:26;04:29;"If I saw them somewhere and somebody said, ""Oh, do you know this person?"""
04:29;04:34;"I would be in a position to say, ""You don't remember me. Actually, we have met, blah, blah, blah."""
04:34;04:36;"I could jog their memory."
04:36;04:43;"I'd be like, big TC head tapped out with a horse meat epo."
04:43;04:46;"Say, ""Okay, well then we got nothing to talk about."""
04:46;04:50;"Seinfeld, we were just hearing a bit about these horse chips."
04:50;04:54;"Can you explain to us what these horse potato chips are all about?"
04:54;05:01;"Oh, yeah. We got tagged a couple times in our Twitter account, @TimeCrisis2000."
05:01;05:06;"There's a brand of chips. It's been created by Mischief."
05:06;05:15;"The trollish company that did the Lil Nas X Nike bootleg shoes with the blood that caused such a fervor."
05:15;05:20;"This is a chip called Illegal Chips, horse meat flavored."
05:20;05:25;"There's a quote on the bag that says, ""These are the flavor the government doesn't want you to try."""
05:25;05:32;"There's a mascot called Illegal Owl. He's a cool alligator with sunglasses and a chef's hat."
05:32;05:41;"This is a troll campaign they did of chips with these pretend flavors of illegal things that you can't eat, such as horse meat."
05:41;05:48;"Correct. Apparently, there was a poison blowfish flavor as well that they made."
05:48;05:52;"What was it? Maggot cheese? Someone was telling us before."
05:52;05:58;"Maggot cheese. This really bothers me. This also gets back to the anti-horse meat bias and hypocrisy."
05:58;06:04;"Yes, horse meat is illegal due to Joe Biden and his brother."
06:04;06:07;"I think the Democrats are going to take a beating in the next election."
06:07;06:10;"I think that's going to be one of the primary reasons why."
06:10;06:18;"Every seat that a Democrat loses in 2022, I can guarantee, has something to do with the horse meat ban."
06:18;06:24;"Let me clarify. Casu Marzu. This is actually interesting. Do you know about this cheese from Sardinia?"
06:24;06:26;"No, it actually has maggots in it?"
06:26;06:35;"I'm just learning this in real time. It is a pecorino style cheese made unique by drilling a hole in the top, allowing flies to lay eggs inside,"
06:35;06:40;"and then letting the forthcoming generation of maggots eat and defecate in the cheese."
06:40;06:51;"This is a real cheese that I guess is part of the grotesque suite of flavors that mischief has gone for."
06:51;06:53;"I like that there's a generational element."
06:53;06:54;"It's a legacy."
06:54;07:01;"Two generations of flies created this cheese. That's a family business right there."
07:01;07:07;"No doubt. The theme obviously being banned foods, I guess. I guess that poisoned blowfish."
07:07;07:12;"Fair enough if it's banned foods. I just don't like the idea that you're putting something like horse meat,"
07:12;07:16;"which Americans were buying in the grocery stores recently as the 1970s,"
07:16;07:23;"you're putting it in the same category as something like maggot cheese, which most people think maggots are gross,"
07:23;07:28;"or poisoned blowfish, which obviously is very dangerous to consume."
07:28;07:33;"This is the second time we've talked about this company because I think we talked about the Lil Nas X blood shoes."
07:33;07:38;"It's such a pseudo event. Those shoes even exist."
07:38;07:43;"It was just this totally made up, ""Lil Nas X is using blood. He's a Satanist."""
07:43;07:47;"Then he comes out and he's so savvy that he can make a joke about,"
07:47;07:53;"""Why are you guys worrying about my blood shoes when people are dying?"""
07:53;07:57;"But who is this company? They're just a troll business?"
07:57;08:05;"I would call them a marketing company that's very edgy, that uses deliberately provocative products to make noise."
08:05;08:09;"They made a saw blade weekend record. Did you see this?"
08:09;08:12;"It's a playable record by the weekend."
08:12;08:18;"It's an actual saw blade that you can put in a machine and cut stuff with, but it has the grooves of a record."
08:18;08:21;"I guess they do these outlandish products."
08:21;08:24;"Like a skill saw or a miter saw?"
08:24;08:27;"Oh man, I'm not as steeped in the hole as you are."
08:27;08:29;"10 inch blade on that?"
08:29;08:32;"I can find out. One of those."
08:32;08:36;"It's like some Andy Warhol shit. They've fully fused commerce and art."
08:39;08:42;"Biggest standing cinema"
08:42;08:45;"Dress my friends up just for show"
08:45;08:48;"See them as they really are"
08:48;08:54;"Put the people in my brain"
08:54;08:57;"Two new pens to have a go"
08:57;09:00;"I'd like to be a gallery"
09:00;09:03;"Put you all inside my show"
09:06;09:09;"Andy Warhol looks a scream"
09:09;09:12;"Hand him on my wall"
09:12;09:15;"Andy Warhol silver screen"
09:15;09:18;"Can't tell them apart at all"
09:18;09:27;"I feel like in the future, all big businesses, they'll have their mainstream marketing company."
09:27;09:31;"They'll have their crisis PR for damage control."
09:31;09:36;"But then they'll simultaneously be paying their troll company to create drama."
09:36;09:40;"I could totally see that one day that there's some congressional hearing."
09:40;09:47;"You just find out that Kraft Foods was both paying some company to save the reputation of Kraft Foods"
09:47;09:52;"while also paying some company to come up with insane, disgusting ideas."
09:52;09:55;"Just to stay in the conversation. Really."
09:55;09:57;"Just to dominate."
09:57;10:00;"Gotta keep those Kraft singles relevant."
10:00;10:02;"Gotta keep them edgy."
10:02;10:03;"That's right."
10:03;10:08;"The Weeknd record on a saw blade, it just feels like almost too incongruous."
10:08;10:09;"Do you know what I mean?"
10:09;10:11;"Like, I just don't see the Weeknd."
10:11;10:16;"Yeah, if it was like a casual Weeknd fan being like, or even the hardcore one."
10:16;10:20;"You mean just because you don't associate the Weeknd with like, power tools?"
10:20;10:22;"I'm thinking like Slayer."
10:22;10:23;"Or Slayer, sure."
10:23;10:28;"Or Tim Allen does a live comedy record, comes on a saw blade."
10:28;10:30;"You're like, well, of course, he's the home improvement guy."
10:30;10:32;"And he probably has released albums."
10:32;10:34;"That's a great idea."
10:34;10:36;"Seinfeld, hop on a Discogs."
10:36;10:39;"Check out the Tim Allen comedy specials on vinyl."
10:39;10:41;"Tim Allen tweets."
10:41;10:42;"Yeah, someone tweets."
10:42;10:46;"Can you buy a Tim Allen record? An LP?"
10:46;10:51;"Any comedy being issued on vinyl is so funny to me."
10:51;10:54;"I think strictly Bill Cosby, right?"
10:54;10:57;"Well, that's back in, that was the predominant media."
10:57;11:01;"But I'm saying like, there's like definitely new comedy that's on vinyl."
11:01;11:03;"And I'm just like, vinyl?"
11:03;11:05;"Yeah, I'm not seeing any Tim Allen."
11:05;11:07;"Oh, wait a second."
11:07;11:09;"Tool time."
11:09;11:11;"Tim Allen's Tool Time."
11:11;11:12;"No, no."
11:12;11:13;"No, I'm making it up."
11:13;11:17;"Tim, he actually doesn't, I think he only has one comedy."
11:17;11:18;"Oh, you know what?"
11:18;11:19;"It's on a compilation."
11:19;11:21;"It's a Just for Laughs compilation."
11:21;11:23;"Not sure if he's ever put out an album."
11:23;11:26;"Lay in the Attic is reissuing vinyl."
11:26;11:29;"I mean, back in the day, it really was a thing."
11:29;11:32;"In the early 60s, right when Kennedy was elected,"
11:32;11:35;"there was an album that was one of the best selling albums in the country"
11:35;11:38;"that was just a parody of The First Family."
11:38;11:39;"Yeah."
11:39;11:42;"You always see that at record stores for like 10 cents."
11:42;11:46;"Yeah, Cosby, Woody Allen, you know, comedians that had like--"
11:46;11:49;"Vaughn Meador, The First Family, 1962."
11:49;11:52;"Yeah, just the idea that that'd be something on an audio format."
11:52;11:56;"You know, and I guess in 1962, you're barely out of the radio age."
11:56;11:58;"So the idea that you would just be like, ""Come listen to this sh*t,"""
11:58;12:00;"and everybody sits down and listens to like, you know,"
12:00;12:04;"a 34-minute comedy album with like skits and stuff."
12:04;12:08;"I mean, I can remember in the 90s, like being at summer camp"
12:08;12:11;"and somebody playing me like Adam Sandler skits"
12:11;12:14;"and being like dying laughing."
12:14;12:16;"Jerky Boys."
12:16;12:18;"Oh, Jerky Boys."
12:18;12:21;"As discussed on the show, Jerky Boys, very influential."
12:21;12:26;"The first Radiohead album, Pablo Honey is named after a Jerky Boys bit."
12:26;12:28;"That's right. I love that for them."
12:28;12:31;"Yeah, Radiohead, when they came on the scene,"
12:31;12:36;"they were mixing influences, you know, everything from the Pixies to Kraut Rock,"
12:36;12:39;"a little bit of Jerky Boys, and they mixed it in a stew"
12:39;12:42;"and they created a type of experimental rock music"
12:42;12:45;"that the world had never heard before, and the rest is history."
12:45;12:48;"Just a sprinkling of dice."
12:48;12:50;"A little bit of Andrew Dice Clay."
12:50;12:54;"Colin Greenwood was a big Andrew Dice Clay head."
12:54;12:56;"It's basically Andrew Dice Clay meets Pink Floyd."
12:56;12:59;"That's what Radiohead is."
12:59;13:03;"I remember Dennis Leary had like a big album in the 90s."
13:03;13:04;"Huge. I had that."
13:04;13:06;"He had a pretty good song."
13:06;13:08;"Matt, can you throw on I'm an Ass**** by Dennis Leary?"
13:08;13:11;"Dude, Dennis Leary, classic. I'm an Ass****."
13:11;13:15;"Are those MTV bits he would do?"
13:15;13:16;"Oh, yeah."
13:16;13:20;"Like the black and white talking about Cindy Crawford, I remember."
13:20;13:24;"Do you remember who produced Dice's album?"
13:24;13:25;"Rick Rubin."
13:25;13:27;"What does that even mean?"
13:27;13:29;"Produced."
13:29;13:30;"It's like."
13:30;13:32;"I think he signed him."
13:32;13:51;"I'm just a regular Joe with a regular job."
13:51;13:53;"No cure for cancer."
13:53;13:54;"Suburbanites."
13:54;13:55;"Good title."
13:55;13:56;"Leakist."
13:56;13:57;"Yeah."
13:57;13:59;"Porno and books about."
13:59;14:02;"I actually know."
14:02;14:03;"It just."
14:03;14:04;"Damn."
14:04;14:06;"It just came out of nowhere."
14:06;14:08;"God, this is influential for me."
14:08;14:09;"Oh, yeah."
14:09;14:10;"No cure for cancer."
14:10;14:12;"I don't think I've ever heard this, to be honest."
14:12;14:36;"But sometimes that just ain't enough to keep a man like me interested."
14:36;14:48;"The violent fence."
14:48;14:57;"This is tight."
14:57;14:59;"What's wrong with that, Dennis?"
14:59;15:28;"It's hot out."
15:28;15:38;"I gotta tell you, this is very proto Tim Heidecker."
15:38;15:48;"Oh, yeah, that's a good bridge."
15:48;16:02;"I wonder if Heidecker would give it up for this or just like he'd just be like, distance."
16:02;16:09;"We were like, is he making fun of this kind of comedy or, you know, like the last Heidecker"
16:09;16:12;"special, obviously, clearly a parody of a bad standup."
16:12;16:18;"I just mean more like the music that, you know, there's this it's sincere enough that"
16:18;16:19;"it's good."
16:19;16:20;"Yeah, it's happening."
16:20;16:21;"Yeah."
16:21;16:22;"Two words, nuclear weapons of Russia, Germany, Romania."
16:22;16:23;"They can have all the democracy they want."
16:23;16:24;"They can have a big democracy cake walk right through the middle of the square."
16:24;16:25;"And it won't make a lick of difference because we got the bomb."
16:25;16:26;"So, John, wait, Russia has the bomb, too, bro."
16:26;16:27;"So does China."
16:27;16:28;"And he's going to be pretty pissed off."
16:28;16:29;"You know why?"
16:29;16:30;"Have you ever heard of the bomb?"
16:30;16:51;"We'll multiply that by 15 million times."
16:51;17:15;"So, you know, you really are an ass."
17:15;17:22;"I'm going to be on the news."
17:22;17:23;"I'm going to be on the news."
18:42;18:43;"Alright, Dennis Leary."
18:43;18:45;"Okay, I don't, yeah, I don't know if, I think I'm wrong."
18:45;18:50;"I don't think this album went platinum, but the single ""Asshole"" did go platinum in Australia."
18:50;18:52;"Very different time."
18:52;18:54;"What's the deal with Dennis Leary?"
18:54;19:00;"I mean, huge stand-up career, and then he was on like a weird like kind of network, like"
19:00;19:01;"a lot of FX shows."
19:01;19:02;"Fire department drama."
19:02;19:07;"I remember people, I remember, yeah, people just being like really into his, some of his"
19:07;19:09;"early FX shows."
19:09;19:14;"And then he had that like sex, drugs, and rock and roll show on FX."
19:14;19:22;"I feel like he's sort of had that, his personality works very well with the Sons of Anarchy adjacent"
19:22;19:23;"kind of crowd."
19:23;19:25;"So, okay, he's done many shows for FX."
19:25;19:28;"So he has this kind of like, I guess the way that like we're all curb heads, there's probably"
19:28;19:30;"like some Leary heads out there."
19:30;19:31;"Oh, definitely."
19:31;19:36;"I mean, I wonder if he ever like goes down and like gets on stage and does stand-up at"
19:36;19:38;"like the Cellar or whatever."
19:38;19:42;"Oh, and I guess he's also a major voice in the Ice Age franchise."
19:42;19:43;"Great career."
19:43;19:44;"Yeah, great career."
19:44;19:47;"I wonder when he's going to release another album."
19:47;19:55;"His last album, 2004, Merry F*** Christmas."
19:55;19:58;"These are the first three tracks on Merry F*** Christmas."
19:58;20:00;"Number one, Merry F*** Christmas."
20:00;20:03;"Number two, Fat Guy on the Plane."
20:03;20:06;"Number three, Death Mute Cocktail Party."
20:06;20:09;"All right, I don't know if we need to listen to this one."
20:09;20:14;"By the way, speaking, my elegant transition was speaking of great careers."
20:14;20:16;"We got Bruce Hornsby on the horn."
20:16;20:17;"Okay, great."
20:17;20:19;"Hornsby on the horn."
20:19;20:20;"Let's get Hornsby on the horn."
20:20;20:28;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
20:28;20:32;"I'm noticing he spells his name with one N, which I've never seen before, actually."
20:32;20:33;"I never heard of it."
20:33;20:34;"Oh yeah."
20:34;20:35;"It's kind of like French, like Denis."
20:35;20:36;"You know what's funny?"
20:36;20:43;"Now I'm picturing, I'm just picturing in 1993, there definitely was somebody somewhere whose"
20:43;20:48;"two favorite songs were Creep by Radiohead and A***** by Dennis Leary."
20:48;20:51;"Just jamming those two songs on repeat."
20:51;20:54;"Just like when they're feeling a little emo, it's Creep and then they're just like-"
20:54;20:55;"Early incel."
20:55;20:56;"Yeah, proto incel."
20:56;21:03;"Before you had 4chan and Reddit, you had to just kind of listen to, alternate between"
21:03;21:04;"listening to Creep and A*****."
21:04;21:08;"Speaking of A*****, here I am."
21:08;21:09;"What's up, Bruce?"
21:09;21:12;"In all my A*****."
21:12;21:13;"Welcome back to the show."
21:13;21:14;"How are you?"
21:14;21:16;"Wait, Bruce, do you know the song A***** by Dennis Leary?"
21:16;21:20;"Does Jake Longstretch want to sing it to me?"
21:20;21:22;"I'm an A*****."
21:22;21:25;"I just heard it for the first time in maybe 30 years."
21:25;21:29;"We were just walking down memory lane."
21:29;21:31;"It was a hit single in 1993."
21:31;21:32;"In 1993?"
21:32;21:33;"Okay, well, yeah."
21:33;21:34;"No, I listened."
21:34;21:35;"It was a hit single."
21:35;21:42;"No, but I got to say, Jake, just to change the subject from Dennis Leary, I've become"
21:42;21:44;"quite mad for your painting."
21:44;21:45;"Oh, wow."
21:45;21:46;"Oh, awesome."
21:46;21:48;"I just love it."
21:48;21:50;"It just hits me."
21:50;21:54;"The fading letters of toys for us."
21:54;21:55;"I just love the feeling of that."
21:55;21:59;"You know, it's just sort of a dying era, you know, representing it."
21:59;22:05;"I love the one with the majestic mountains in the background in the far distance, and"
22:05;22:08;"then in the near future, there's the Taco Bell, you know."
22:08;22:10;"I guess I'm mad for it."
22:10;22:15;"So anyway, just for that, I mean, you won the Pollock Krasner Award."
22:15;22:17;"Yes, many years ago."
22:17;22:19;"I see that you've been perusing my CV."
22:19;22:24;"Well, I saw the paintings and I decided to look a little closer."
22:24;22:29;"We're now aligned with Lee Krasner, the embattled Long Island wife."
22:29;22:30;"Hell yeah, Bruce."
22:30;22:33;"And Bruce, I don't know if I'm blowing up your spot."
22:33;22:36;"We don't have to talk about it if you don't, but we've had private conversations where"
22:36;22:38;"I know that you really know about painting."
22:38;22:42;"You've collected some work of some heavy hitter American painters."
22:42;22:45;"Well, mostly just one guy, Edward Hopper."
22:45;22:46;"Oh, wow."
22:46;22:51;"So we were moving back from LA after being there for 10 years, 80 to 90."
22:51;22:55;"I thought Tom Wolfe called that decade the me decade, but I think it was the 70s he was"
22:55;22:56;"talking about."
22:56;23:01;"But I always said I went out there for me, referencing Wolfe, but I had it wrong."
23:01;23:06;"Anyway, we're moving back to Williamsburg, Virginia, where we're from."
23:06;23:09;"So we needed to fill up some walls on a new house for a building."
23:09;23:16;"And so we went to New York and walked around the Soho area and went from gallery to gallery."
23:16;23:17;"And we didn't see anything we really loved."
23:17;23:21;"And toward the end of the day, we thought, you know what?"
23:21;23:23;"Hopper was a friend of my grandfather."
23:23;23:26;"They grew up in Nyack, New York together."
23:26;23:32;"We always thought we were related because some people in our family referred to Hopper's"
23:32;23:34;"mom as Auntie Hopper."
23:34;23:38;"So that thin bit of evidence made us think that he was related."
23:38;23:45;"And we used for the cover of my record, 1993, ""Harbor Lights,"" we used one of his famous"
23:45;23:47;"paintings, ""Rooms by the Sea."""
23:47;23:51;"And so my story at the time that I was telling in interview after interview was this guy"
23:51;23:53;"was related to us."
23:53;23:58;"We found another old, someone had saved an article about Hopper in the Nyack paper, and"
23:58;24:01;"my mom had it in her archives."
24:01;24:04;"And it said, ""Here's an article about our dear friend, Ed."""
24:04;24:10;"And then we realized, ""Okay, sorry, Hornsby, you're not related."""
24:10;24:13;"But anyway, we were very interested in Hopper."
24:13;24:19;"And we found out that a dealer named Herschel Adler up in Segway, 2nd Street, Eastside,"
24:19;24:25;"we went up there and they showed us these paintings and we instantly became Hopper collectors."
24:25;24:28;"- Wow, wait, I'm blown away right now."
24:28;24:32;"So were these like oil paintings or watercolors?"
24:32;24:36;"- The oils were made out of my league."
24:36;24:37;"- Or not available even."
24:37;24:39;"- Well, no, they were available."
24:39;24:47;"We started getting inundated with offers for someone who's selling a Hopper oil, and it"
24:47;24:50;"was for $15 million, that sort of thing."
24:50;24:51;"- In the '80s it was?"
24:51;24:52;"- Yes."
24:52;24:55;"- I was gonna say, man, you could have gotten a deal in the '80s."
24:55;24:57;"Now they'd be like, God knows what."
24:57;25:00;"- This was '91."
25:00;25:06;"And so first we have the catalog of Raisin A. over here."
25:06;25:08;"- So do I, I have that as well."
25:08;25:13;"- So yes, we have 20 Hopper pieces, mostly studies for drawing."
25:13;25:16;"Some famous oil paintings, we have studies."
25:16;25:20;"And we have, well, we used to have four watercolors."
25:20;25:22;"They're no joke on a financial level."
25:22;25:24;"They were our big purchases."
25:24;25:28;"- I would think even a watercolor would be a major commitment."
25:28;25:29;"- It's up there."
25:29;25:34;"It's just like anything where no more of these will be made 'cause the gas is gone."
25:34;25:35;"It just continues to."
25:35;25:41;"So it's frankly been probably the best investment we've made, but we didn't do it for that reason."
25:41;25:44;"We did it because we loved the work."
25:44;25:46;"So right, Ezra, you remember that."
25:46;25:47;"I guess we talked about it before."
25:47;25:50;"- Yeah, one time when you were hanging out, you were telling me a bit about your Hopper"
25:50;25:51;"collection."
25:51;25:54;"So you got an eye for great American painters."
25:54;25:59;"- I love Edward Hopper, and there's definitely a through line from his work to mine, for"
25:59;26:00;"sure."
26:00;26:01;"- I think so too."
26:01;26:03;"- So that makes sense that you're interested in my work."
26:03;26:04;"It's very flattering."
26:04;26:05;"I'm glad you looked it up."
26:05;26:06;"- Thank you."
26:06;26:07;"- Are these oils on canvas?"
26:07;26:09;"They don't look, they are oils on canvas."
26:09;26:13;"Okay, so you have your own way of doing it."
26:13;26:14;"It's just, I just love it."
26:14;26:17;"So anyway, just wanted to blow you up there."
26:17;26:18;"- I'll have to send you a book, Bruce."
26:18;26:21;"I'll have to get your address and I'll send you a book of my work."
26:21;26:22;"- Okay, yeah."
26:22;26:24;"That sounds great."
26:24;26:30;"We often use paintings for artwork 'cause I'm not much for sort of putting myself on"
26:30;26:32;"covers."
26:32;26:38;"And so, who knows, maybe I'll come to you and say, ""Hey, could I use this for something?"""
26:38;26:39;"Anyway, that's it."
26:39;26:40;"- That'd be amazing."
26:40;26:41;"- Yeah."
26:41;26:44;"- It looks like you've done some work for Ezra for Vampire Weekend."
26:44;26:49;"I saw some pieces that said Vampire Weekend, maybe a t-shirt."
26:49;26:51;"- That's a very rare, great shirt."
26:51;26:54;"I think we only sold it at the Hollywood Bowl."
26:54;26:58;"That's a Jake painting from Vampire Weekend, Richard Pictures."
26:58;27:02;"The one I'm thinking of, I think it's this one, where there's a tennis court with no"
27:02;27:05;"net and it says Vampire Weekend on it."
27:05;27:06;"I think I could have that."
27:06;27:07;"- Wow."
27:07;27:11;"- So anyway, that's just something that I saw when I Googled you."
27:11;27:13;"- That might've been some fan bootleg art."
27:13;27:15;"- Yeah, definitely possible."
27:15;27:17;"- Combining our worlds, yeah."

28:16;28:23;"Okay, do you guys know who the classical virtuoso concert pianist Jeremy Dink is?"
28:23;28:25;"- No, actually, not familiar."
28:25;28:28;"- He's really a freak, and he's a total polymath."
28:28;28:33;"You know, he's just one of those guys that if you were a jealous person, he would just"
28:33;28:36;"piss you off because he's just got it all."
28:36;28:41;"So he's a great writer, too, and he's written this memoir, and it's called--great title--"
28:41;28:47;"""For Us Music School Nerds, Every Good Boy Does Fine"" is the title."
28:47;28:49;"Do you guys know the reference?"
28:49;28:56;"- Yes. I always heard ""Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge,"" and yeah, you're, like, following the notes, E-G-B-D-F."
28:56;29:03;"- Exactly. It's the lines. The spaces are F-A-C-E, face, and on the stave,"
29:03;29:09;"and the lines are just what you said, ""Every good boy does fine or deserves fudge."""
29:09;29:12;"- I got a music theory question for you, Bruce."
29:12;29:20;"If you were playing that as a chord, E-G-B-D-F, what do you call it? Minor 7 plus--"
29:20;29:25;"- E-G-B-D-F. Yeah, it's a weird chord. It's a minor 7 flat 9."
29:25;29:26;"- Flat 9."
29:26;29:33;"- Yeah, the F makes--it gives you some--it takes you into more of a Schoenberg territory."
29:33;29:35;"- Yeah, you're getting weird with that F."
29:35;29:40;"- You know, Elliot Carter or whatever, they may do that. That's actually pretty tonal for them."
29:40;29:45;"But, you know, chords built in stacks of thirds generally are pretty tonal,"
29:45;29:51;"but you would use, obviously, if you want to make a tonal chord, it would be F-sharp, which would be the natural 9."
29:51;29:56;"So, you would have a beautiful Bill Evans-ish chord, E minor 9."
29:56;29:57;"- Right."
29:57;30:06;"- Yeah, so there you have it. I dare you to put that chord, E minor 7 flat 9, on the next Vampire record."
30:06;30:11;"- We recently got some positive feedback about having some music talk on the program."
30:11;30:14;"I'm just going to play it on the piano real quick. Let's hear what that sounds like."
30:14;30:16;"- Yeah, okay, great."
30:16;30:23;"[Piano playing]"
30:23;30:25;"- Is that five notes?"
30:25;30:29;"- Yeah, five does. It sounds like some Smiley Whiplash music."
30:29;30:31;"- We could make that work somewhere."
30:31;30:34;"[Humming]"
30:34;30:40;"- So, we got a lot to talk about, Bruce, but the first question, have you ever eaten horse meat?"
30:40;30:46;"- I don't think so, but who knows what's in the quarter pounder with cheese?"
30:46;30:47;"- Great point."
30:47;30:49;"- Who knows what's in the one quarter pounder?"
30:49;30:51;"- We did mean intentionally, but yeah."
30:51;30:55;"- You have not knowingly eaten horse meat. You've traveled the world."
30:55;30:59;"I'm sure you've been to places where horse meat is served or eaten."
30:59;31:04;"In your whole life in America, were you ever in a situation where you were near horse meat,"
31:04;31:09;"or you saw it at a store, or you knew people who ate horse meat in the U.S.?"
31:09;31:12;"- I don't think so. I used to ride ponies when I was a kid,"
31:12;31:18;"but nobody was slicing them up and keeping the meat, so yeah, no."
31:18;31:22;"- Well, you're clearly a savvy investor with the Edward Hopper paintings."
31:22;31:26;"What would you think about a chain of horse meat restaurants in the U.S.?"
31:26;31:30;"There's a bit of a stigma that we'd have to fight. We'd hire a good PR company."
31:30;31:32;"- Does Erewhon offer horse meat?"
31:32;31:38;"- We're going to fight to get horse meat in Erewhon."
31:38;31:41;"- That's your next food. That's right."
31:41;31:50;"You've got to go there tomorrow, you and Ariel, and insist upon a section totally dedicated to horse meat."
31:50;31:52;"- Organic American horse meat."
31:52;31:55;"- That may make Erewhon interested. I hope so."
31:55;31:58;"- What's the most unusual meat you've consumed in your life?"
31:58;32:02;"- Well, I'm not a big fan of venison. I'm not a big fan of deer meat."
32:02;32:04;"That's kind of standard, but it's—"
32:04;32:05;"- But you've had it?"
32:05;32:12;"- Yes, because it's common around here. My son—one of my twin sons is our resident country boy/daredevil,"
32:12;32:18;"so he's a bit of a hunter, and we live out in the woods, so there's a sizable deer population."
32:18;32:22;"And Russell Hornsby likes to go out and blast away."
32:22;32:26;"You know, we don't really like it, but we allow it. We're okay with it."
32:26;32:28;"- You're not a hunter yourself?"
32:28;32:34;"- No, no. My dad grew up in a real country family around here, and all his brothers hunted."
32:34;32:39;"So he thought he should do it because it was part of his family tradition."
32:39;32:43;"He took us out once or twice, but I always got the feeling—I was about maybe seven years old when this happened—"
32:43;32:46;"I always got the feeling that he kind of hated it."
32:46;32:52;"And I'm my dad's son. My idea of roughing it is no HBO in the hotel room."
32:52;32:55;"That's my dad, too, you know?"
32:55;33:00;"So I don't know where Russell Hornsby got it, but it's fine. You know, he loves all that."
33:00;33:03;"- Do you let him put all the meat in your chest freezer?"
33:03;33:09;"- We'll keep some of it, and we'll try to go through it and have at it every once in a while."
33:09;33:12;"I don't know what he ends up doing with it. I really don't know."
33:12;33:16;"He goes to New Kent County, which is one county up, it's real rural,"
33:16;33:23;"and there's some guy who slices and dices and gives him this big packages."
33:23;33:25;"And I don't know what happens to him."
33:25;33:32;"I guess he knows a couple of people around here who are mad for venison, so he gives it to them."
33:32;33:34;"And again, we end up eating it."
33:34;33:38;"He doesn't want to be one of those guys who just kills and doesn't eat the kill, so."
33:38;33:40;"- So this is kind of a sweet story."
33:40;33:45;"You're not a huge venison fan, but you'll eat a little bit a couple times a year"
33:45;33:48;"just to support your son and his interests."
33:48;33:51;"- It's not horrible, you know? It's edible. It's just—"
33:51;33:53;"- How are you cooking it up?"
33:53;33:55;"- I don't know. He does it. I'm just—"
33:55;33:59;"- But I mean, is it like—it's just like a steak? It's not like some—"
33:59;34:03;"- Yeah, it's kind of like steak. I'm just enduring this, you know?"
34:03;34:06;"So I'm not really having much to do with it. I really am pretty clueless."
34:06;34:12;"But I can get Russell Hornsby on the phone, and he'll be glad to regale you with his tails, if you'd like that."
34:12;34:19;"- Well, our last episode was a horse meat special, so maybe we'll do a venison special in the not-too-distant future."
34:19;34:23;"- I just want to see what Erewhon, how they react, because that could be something."
34:23;34:26;"They're doing pretty well, that store, aren't they?"
34:26;34:28;"- Oh, yeah. They're raking it in."

35:47;35:48;"- Hmm."
35:48;35:52;"- Tough to get a good vantage point on a Cheesecake Factory."
35:52;35:53;"- What do you mean?"
35:53;35:55;"- Well, they're usually... - Oh, as a painter."

36:10;36:12;"They're in very dense environments"

36:32;36:35;"which I photographed on three separate occasions..."
36:35;36:36;"- Wow."
36:36;36:38;"- With the hope of making a painting of it,"
36:38;36:39;"and it's just not happening."
36:39;36:40;"- It didn't work."
36:40;36:41;"- It's not happening."
36:41;36:43;"I got onto the roof of a building,"
36:43;36:45;"sort of semi-illegally, to photograph it."
36:45;36:46;"It just still wasn't..."
36:46;36:49;"- So you just gotta find the right CPK to inspire you."
36:49;36:50;"It's just not the one in Pasadena."
36:50;36:52;"- You gotta find the right one from the right angle."
36:52;36:55;"You can't just go there and just shoot a picture of it."
36:55;36:56;"It's gotta..."
36:56;36:58;"It has to be some poetry in it somehow,"
36:58;37:01;"which is tough to wring out sometimes."
37:01;37:02;"- Got it."
37:02;37:03;"Okay, I was just..."
37:03;37:04;"- Anyway, that's where I'm at."
37:04;37:05;"You mentioned fast food."
37:05;37:06;"I'm just like, ""Okay."""
37:06;37:07;"- Yeah."
37:07;37:09;"- I'll hit Del Taco once in a blue moon."
37:09;37:10;"I like Del Taco."
37:10;37:11;"- Me too."
37:11;37:13;"When I come to LA and I'm hungry,"
37:13;37:16;"I'll ride to see a Del Taco in the distance."
37:16;37:17;"I'm headed..."
37:17;37:19;"- You're there, drive-through."
37:19;37:20;"- Exactly right."
37:20;37:21;"I'm fine."
37:21;37:23;"- Hey, the first time you called into our show,"
37:23;37:26;"I remember you talking about you living in LA in the '80s"
37:26;37:28;"and hitting like..."
37:28;37:29;"- What was it?"
37:29;37:30;"- Carl's Jr.?"
37:30;37:32;"- Someone recognizing you in the parking lot?"
37:32;37:33;"Like a Carl's Jr. or something?"
37:33;37:34;"- Right."
37:34;37:37;"I drove this (beep) car that I've had for years."
37:37;37:38;"I'd never..."
37:38;37:40;"It was just a wreck."
37:40;37:43;"And I'm driving in with my guitar player at the time."
37:43;37:44;"When we walk out,"
37:44;37:49;"some guy's standing by my car and he sees me and he says,"
37:49;37:52;"""Oh, come on, man, you can do better than this."""
37:52;37:53;"- That's so funny."
37:53;37:56;"- Yeah, I think I may or may not have told the story."
37:56;37:58;"This car was on its last legs."
37:58;38:03;"I was buying an old Neve board from the studio, Unique."
38:03;38:06;"David Bowie and John Lennon had recorded on this."
38:06;38:08;"The provenance of this board was just amazing."
38:08;38:09;"- Wow."
38:09;38:11;"- And so Tony was setting me up"
38:11;38:13;"'cause he was sort of in the know"
38:13;38:16;"with all these gearheads and these companies"
38:16;38:17;"that sold this stuff."
38:17;38:19;"So he's coming with me."
38:19;38:22;"We're driving into Hollywood to see this board."
38:22;38:25;"And, okay, my air conditioner doesn't work."
38:25;38:30;"So it's just blasting hot air on a 98 degree LA day."
38:30;38:32;"His window will not go down."
38:32;38:34;"It's stuck up."
38:34;38:36;"The handle of the gear shift is broken"
38:36;38:41;"so you can cut your hand shifting into reverse."
38:41;38:43;"Luckily, I was gonna sell it"
38:43;38:46;"and I sold it to a former keyboard tech of mine."
38:46;38:49;"Who really did a pretty bad job for me."
38:49;38:54;"And so we didn't have great love for this guy."
38:54;38:56;"So it was sort of beautiful armor."
38:56;38:57;"He bought it for me."
38:57;38:59;"I lived in Van Nuys at the time."
38:59;39:01;"Balboa and Van Owen."
39:01;39:03;"Right across from, I think, Birmingham."
39:03;39:04;"- This is like '85?"
39:04;39:06;"- This is about '90."
39:06;39:07;"- Okay, okay, later."
39:07;39:08;"- Back to Virginia."
39:08;39:12;"And he buys it for me for 250 bucks or something."
39:12;39:14;"And he blew a gasket on the way back"
39:14;39:16;"from my house to his house."
39:16;39:19;"And so we thought, again, this is as it should be."
39:19;39:21;"Yeah, he was not a great worker."
39:21;39:23;"Kind of a pain in the ass."
39:23;39:26;"And this is your sentence for that."
39:26;39:30;"So yes, that's probably the story I told."
39:30;39:31;"The Carl's Jr."
39:31;39:32;"- Right."
39:32;39:36;"- And the subsequent sale to get rid of the old Hulk."
39:36;39:37;"A station wagon."
39:37;39:38;"'Cause you know, we keyboard players"
39:38;39:41;"plugging around old fender roads,"
39:41;39:44;"and OB, et cetera."
39:44;39:46;"Station wagon was our game."
39:46;39:49;"- And that was really like before the heyday of the minivan."
39:49;39:52;"How minivan would be the move?"
39:52;39:53;"- It would be good,"
39:53;39:55;"but there's not as much story space there."
39:55;39:57;"The seats go, at least the ones I know, go on."
39:57;39:58;"- That's where you're wrong."
39:58;39:59;"- Okay, see, I--"
39:59;40:02;"- 'Cause Jake used to rip around in a Honda Odyssey"
40:02;40:04;"that had nothing but the front two seats."
40:04;40:06;"- I have a 2011 Honda Odyssey"
40:06;40:08;"with all the seats out of the back."
40:08;40:11;"So you can fit like a four by eight sheet of plywood"
40:11;40:12;"in the back."
40:12;40:14;"So you can easily get like a fender roads in there."
40:14;40:16;"- Maybe three fender roads."
40:16;40:17;"- Easily."
40:17;40:18;"- Yeah, right?"
40:18;40:19;"Okay, to know about that,"
40:19;40:21;"'cause our minivans were built for our family."
40:21;40:24;"You know, we're bought for our family and friends."
40:24;40:27;"So it had three layers of seats."
40:27;40:28;"- Oh yeah, with all those seats,"
40:28;40:30;"yeah, that's gonna be a problem."
40:30;40:31;"- Yeah, you got no shot."
40:31;40:33;"The keyboard guys got no chance."
40:33;40:34;"You should play."
40:34;40:35;"Dulcimer."
40:35;40:37;"- You know what, actually, Bruce,"
40:37;40:39;"I was curious about this,"
40:39;40:41;"'cause at Jake's recommendation,"
40:41;40:45;"I finally watched this great documentary about Kenny G."
40:45;40:47;"I was struck watching Kenny G throughout the film."
40:47;40:50;"You know, he has such a light, nimble instrument,"
40:50;40:52;"the soprano saxophone."
40:52;40:54;"He's just practicing all around his house,"
40:54;40:55;"on the beach,"
40:55;40:57;"just like standing in the kitchen with his family,"
40:57;40:59;"in his bedroom, you know,"
40:59;41:01;"'cause you just like this stick you grab everywhere."
41:01;41:03;"Even compared to like an alto sax,"
41:03;41:05;"the soprano is uniquely light."
41:05;41:07;"But anyway, watching this film,"
41:07;41:10;"I was curious, 'cause Kenny G kind of like blew up"
41:10;41:12;"around the same time you did."
41:12;41:16;"His first big album was like '86, late '80s."
41:16;41:17;"- Okay."
41:17;41:19;"- Just curious, like, you guys ever cross paths?"
41:19;41:21;"You have any opinions on him?"
41:21;41:23;"- We did cross paths one time."
41:23;41:25;"Actually, no, a couple of times."
41:25;41:27;"The first time I crossed paths with Kenny G,"
41:27;41:33;"I was playing in 1992, Bill Clinton's inauguration."
41:33;41:37;"I was part of the band playing in the Arkansas Ball,"
41:37;41:39;"which was the one."
41:39;41:43;"So it was kind of fun, kind of not, but it was okay."
41:43;41:44;"- Wait, wait, but break that down."
41:44;41:46;"So you're saying you were playing in the band."
41:46;41:47;"It wasn't just like,"
41:47;41:50;"""Oh, and now here's Bruce Hornsby to play two songs."""
41:50;41:53;"They like put together like an all-star band for the event?"
41:53;41:54;"- Well, they did."
41:54;41:55;"They had me play on a lot."
41:55;41:58;"I was playing, I guess I was sort of the house pianist."
41:58;42:01;"George Duke and I were the two keyboard players."
42:01;42:02;"- Whoa."
42:02;42:04;"- And I did a couple of songs as well."
42:04;42:06;"So I get them a little mixed up in my mind"
42:06;42:07;"all these years later,"
42:07;42:11;"'cause I also did the '96 Arkansas Ball when he won again."
42:11;42:13;"I was Bill Clinton's opening act a lot."
42:13;42:14;"I played at Pacific Amber Theater,"
42:14;42:17;"the old Costa Mesa Pacific Amber Theater,"
42:17;42:19;"as one of the opening acts for Bill Clinton."
42:19;42:22;"And then I ended up doing so much for him"
42:22;42:26;"for the next many, six to eight years."
42:26;42:29;"And so, right, Kenny G,"
42:29;42:32;"he was either on the '92 Arkansas Ball"
42:32;42:34;"or he was on the '96 Arkansas Ball."
42:34;42:37;"I don't think I actually met him then,"
42:37;42:39;"but I just remember him holding a note"
42:39;42:43;"with his circular breathing skills for a minute."
42:43;42:45;"You know, walking through the crowd,"
42:45;42:48;"wafting through the crowd, holding that note."
42:48;42:50;"But I do remember another time,"
42:50;42:55;"but it's kind of not a kind memory for my best Kenny."
42:55;42:57;"But what the hell, I'll tell it."
42:57;42:59;"This actually happened."
42:59;43:01;"I won't name the name, but okay."
43:01;43:07;"So in 1990, I'm part of this Herbie Hancock special"
43:07;43:10;"called Coast to Coast at the China Club in LA."
43:10;43:12;"And it was an amazing array of geeks."
43:12;43:16;"It had, oh, I don't know, everybody from Herbie, of course,"
43:16;43:21;"to Lou Reed, Michael Bolton, Sang, Sting, on and on."
43:21;43:22;"- Oh, yeah, wow."
43:22;43:24;"- And B.B. King, I played,"
43:24;43:26;"B.B. King and I did something together."
43:26;43:29;"We did a Leon Russell's version of Mighty Quinn"
43:29;43:31;"from the Leon live."
43:31;43:34;"(Humming)"
43:34;43:37;"- I also just love Lou Reed and Michael Bolton"
43:37;43:39;"being listed back to back."
43:39;43:42;"That's wild that you just did that."
43:42;43:43;"- It is wild, yeah."
43:43;43:45;"So is the China Club still there?"
43:45;43:46;"It probably isn't."
43:46;43:47;"- Not familiar with it."
43:47;43:48;"- Oh, you don't know it."
43:48;43:49;"- Don't believe it."
43:49;43:50;"- Never heard of it."
43:50;43:52;"- Yeah, this was 1990, I think, yeah."
43:52;43:53;"- Okay."
43:53;43:58;"- So downstairs, one of the principals says to me,"
43:58;44:02;"""Hey, I want to do a song, just acoustic guitar,"
44:02;44:04;"and would you back me up on piano?"""
44:04;44:06;"I said, ""Sure, I love this guy."""
44:06;44:09;"And we go downstairs and so we're rehearsing."
44:09;44:11;"All of a sudden, Kenny walks in."
44:11;44:14;"He sees what's happening, the two of us doing this,"
44:14;44:16;"and he comes in and starts insinuating himself"
44:16;44:19;"into our little musical space."
44:19;44:20;"- Like he just starts playing?"
44:20;44:21;"Like you guys are rehearsing"
44:21;44:23;"and you just hear that sweet soprano sax?"
44:23;44:28;"- And my friend just walked off,"
44:28;44:30;"walked out of the room,"
44:30;44:32;"leaving me seated at the keyboard,"
44:32;44:34;"so I was sort of stuck there,"
44:34;44:38;"looking up at Kenny going, ""You know, I don't give a..."""
44:38;44:41;"So that was an awkward moment,"
44:41;44:43;"and I thanked my other friend there."
44:43;44:45;"""Hey, thanks a lot."""
44:45;44:46;"I just didn't know what to do."
44:46;44:48;"So, okay, there was that."
44:48;44:50;"- So there was a very uninspired"
44:50;44:53;"Bruce Hornsby/Kenny G jam."
44:53;44:54;"- Yeah, I thought you were gonna say,"
44:54;44:56;"and then you guys jammed for about 45 minutes."
44:56;44:59;"Only one cassette exists."
44:59;45:02;"- And we played, yes, that's right."
45:02;45:04;"I played one note,"
45:04;45:06;"and he played that circular breathing note."
45:06;45:10;"I just did my spider fingers on one note,"
45:10;45:15;"and it was a magical monochromatic moment."
45:15;45:18;"Okay, the other time was more recent,"
45:18;45:21;"about maybe 2015 or so,"
45:21;45:23;"my country soul brother Ricky Skaggs"
45:23;45:26;"was getting inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame"
45:26;45:28;"at Kenny G."
45:28;45:32;"And so Ricky asked me if I would come out,"
45:32;45:35;"'cause they wanted to play our bluegrass version"
45:35;45:36;"of ""The Way It Is,"""
45:36;45:38;"is my favorite version of that song."
45:38;45:39;"It's so good."
45:39;45:40;"If you want to check it out,"
45:40;45:42;"there's a live Skaggs Hornsby record"
45:42;45:44;"called ""Cluck Ole Hen,"""
45:44;45:46;"and it's just no joke."

46:36;46:39;"playing in some big Nina Squaws auditorium in Nashville,"
46:39;46:40;"and so we played that song,"
46:40;46:42;"and it was just rolling."
46:42;46:43;"It's just so much fun to play"
46:43;46:45;"with the Kentucky Thunderers band."
46:45;46:48;"These guys, just like the John Sebastian song says,"

46:56;46:58;"and Kenny G came over and was very gracious"
46:58;47:00;"and said, ""Wow, that was really something."""
47:00;47:02;"I just was so impressed with it."
47:02;47:04;"So he was very kind, and so I just thought,"

47:05;47:09;"It's very nice of you, and I love playing with this guy."""
47:09;47:11;"And bada-beep, bada-boop."
47:11;47:13;"- He seems like a very nice guy,"
47:13;47:15;"and I really recommend the documentary."
47:15;47:16;"I think you'd enjoy it."
47:16;47:18;"And he also seems to have a sense of humor,"
47:18;47:22;"at least he understands that there's people,"
47:22;47:25;"a lot of people like to hate on his music"
47:25;47:28;"and people in the jazz community go in on him."
47:28;47:30;"I wonder, are you familiar with, in the '90s,"
47:30;47:34;"there was an infamous Pat Metheny takedown?"
47:34;47:35;"- Oh, yeah."
47:35;47:38;"He's an astronaut in that world, or Kenny is."
47:38;47:40;"And, oh, yeah, I know it well."
47:40;47:43;"You know, Pat is one of my great friends."
47:43;47:45;"I mean, I just talked to him three days ago."
47:45;47:46;"- Oh, really?"
47:46;47:48;"So back then when Pat Metheny"
47:48;47:51;"just went for this epic Kenny G takedown,"
47:51;47:54;"did you think about dropping him an email,"
47:54;47:57;"just like, ""Hey, come on, cool it, Pat."
47:57;47:59;"We're doing our best out here""?"
47:59;48:01;"- I left it alone."
48:01;48:02;"It's really rough."
48:02;48:03;"It's so funny you should say that,"
48:03;48:05;"because I happened upon that."
48:05;48:09;"I was just doing the YouTube deep dive, you know,"
48:09;48:11;"that can never end sometimes."
48:11;48:15;"You come across some blues, some Paul Butterfield thing,"
48:15;48:17;"and then right over here you see Muddy Waters"
48:17;48:20;"and Howlin' Wolf do it, and you go, ""Okay, go into that,"""
48:20;48:22;"and then you see Sonny Boy Williamson,"
48:22;48:24;"this nasty as bad as [bleep]"
48:24;48:26;"and, you know, you just go down that rabbit hole"
48:26;48:27;"and it's beautiful."
48:27;48:31;"But somehow in their offerings, you know,"
48:31;48:34;"the algorithm thinks it knows what you like,"
48:34;48:37;"of course, so it's setting me up"
48:37;48:40;"with some Pat Metheny material,"
48:40;48:42;"and one of them was his diatribe,"
48:42;48:46;"you know, his screed, his PG screed."
48:46;48:48;"So I actually listened to that."
48:48;48:49;"It's hilarious you bring this up,"
48:49;48:50;"'cause I just actually listened to that"
48:50;48:52;"about an hour and a half, two hours."
48:52;48:53;"- Whoa. - What?"
48:53;48:55;"- Perfect timing. - And thought, ""Whoa,"
48:55;48:57;"this is harsh."""
48:57;49:00;"Yeah, so I tend to not be that guy."
49:00;49:04;"My mother taught me the old thumper saying"
49:04;49:05;"in the Bambi movie,"
49:05;49:07;"""If you don't have something nice to say,"
49:07;49:09;"don't say nothing at all."""

49:15;49:18;"if I'm gonna write a book, 'cause--"

49:19;49:22;"- Oh, yeah, great idea. - I actually should read"
49:22;49:23;"you guys some of this Jeremy Dink."
49:23;49:25;"It's so--it's so good."
49:25;49:28;"Anyway, my book would mostly be funny stories,"
49:28;49:30;"and I try to find some true-lie"
49:30;49:32;"that connect to these stories."
49:32;49:35;"But there won't be the rag-fest in my book."
49:35;49:37;"If I ever get around to doing it,"
49:37;49:38;"it would never happen."
49:38;49:41;"I will not do that, because,"
49:41;49:44;"I don't know, golden rule, what the hell."
49:44;49:46;"Always a good policy."
49:46;49:48;"And I also think that if there ever was gonna be"
49:48;49:50;"a Pat Metheny, Kenny G,"
49:50;49:52;"kind of like meet-up and truce,"
49:52;49:54;"you could facilitate that."
49:54;49:57;"Well, I know Pat a whole lot better than I know Kenny."
49:57;49:59;"I really don't know Kenny G."
49:59;50:01;"Just run into him, again, those three times."
50:01;50:04;"A Pat Metheny, Bruce Hornsby, Kenny G record would rule."
50:04;50:06;"That'd be--I would love that."
50:06;50:07;"You would have to be in charge."
50:07;50:09;"You'd have to be the boss of the project."
50:09;50:12;"I have to say, and I think this probably rankles Pat,"
50:12;50:14;"'cause I've told him this, and he just laughs about it."
50:14;50:17;"I've told him this, that I'll be in an airport gate,"
50:17;50:20;"and some--this hasn't happened in years,"
50:20;50:23;"but it used to happen in the late '80s, early '90s,"
50:23;50:26;"back in our heyday of being, you know, hit people."
50:26;50:28;"Yuppie women would come up to me and go,"
50:28;50:31;"""You know what? I just love your music."
50:31;50:35;"My husband and I, we make love to you,"
50:35;50:37;"Pat Metheny, and Kenny G."""
50:37;50:39;"[laughter]"
50:39;50:41;"Oh, God. There you go."
50:41;50:43;"There's your album title, ""We Make Love."""
50:43;50:45;"We make love to y'all."
50:45;50:47;"Pat Metheny's an amazing guy."
50:47;50:50;"You know, he played on a couple of my records in the '90s,"
50:50;50:53;"Harbor Lights and Odd House '93, '95."
50:53;50:56;"So he was down here at Odd House '92, '94,"
50:56;50:58;"and he was just ridiculous."
50:58;51:00;"He was just an amazing musician, and one time he played--"
51:00;51:03;"he was on these ridiculous flights of fancy,"
51:03;51:06;"and I had to just stop what we were doing and say,"
51:06;51:07;"""Hey, you know what?"
51:07;51:13;"At the height of your intense dealing with your instrument,"
51:13;51:16;"how much did you practice every day?"""
51:16;51:21;"And he said, ""Well, for about five years,"
51:21;51:27;"from age 13 to 18, I practiced 12 hours a day."""
51:27;51:30;"Because that's the sort of stuff that the Jeremy Danks do."
51:30;51:32;"You know, if you're a concert pianist"
51:32;51:37;"and you want to have a career of any worth and length,"
51:37;51:41;"that's the requirement is 8 to 12 hours a day."
51:41;51:46;"And you know Art Tatum and his disciple,"
51:46;51:49;"Art Tatum II was Oscar Peterson."
51:49;51:51;"Those guys were that way too."
51:51;51:52;"They practiced 12 hours a day."
51:52;51:55;"They would just--Art Tatum would get up and play all day"
51:55;51:58;"until he went to bed with a couple of food breaks."
51:58;52:05;"And so talk about a reason for that otherworldly virtuosity."
52:05;52:06;"That's the reason."
52:06;52:10;"So Pat was that guy, and he said--his statement was amazing."
52:10;52:13;"He said, ""Yes, I practiced 12 hours a day."
52:13;52:18;"I felt I needed to do that if I wanted to deal with Coltrane."""
52:18;52:20;"Because Coltrane was that guy too."
52:20;52:23;"He was that kind of heavy, as we call it, woodshedder."
52:23;52:27;"He was a real woodshedder, like Sonny Rollins on the bridge."
52:27;52:30;"I don't know if you guys know that story."
52:30;52:35;"Yeah, so Pat--there's a reason why he's a freaky musician"
52:35;52:36;"because he put in the work."
52:36;52:38;"He's incredible."
52:38;52:39;"Yeah, it's incredible."
52:39;52:41;"I always thought I was a heavy shedder until I heard--"
52:41;52:46;"I was a 5-hour-a-day guy in college and a little bit post-college"
52:46;52:49;"until I got into songwriting and got more focused on that."
52:49;52:55;"But I spent one semester out of school, living in a farmhouse out in the country"
52:55;52:59;"where they cut up the venison, and I practiced 8 hours a day."
52:59;53:03;"And it's amazing how much better--how much improvement you can make"
53:03;53:08;"in 4 months, say, when you're in the shed 8 hours a day."
53:08;53:09;"So yeah, that's--"
53:09;53:12;"Well, what's funny is that Matheny's beef with Kenny G"
53:12;53:16;"was not his lack of virtuosity, it was his taste,"
53:16;53:19;"which I can't account for because Kenny G is obviously a virtu--"
53:19;53:20;"And Kenny G was definitely playing--"
53:20;53:21;"He's a woodshedder."
53:21;53:22;"Yeah."
53:22;53:25;"In the doc he says now he's down to only 3 hours a day,"
53:25;53:28;"but this is him in his 60s."
53:28;53:30;"Yeah, so that's impressive, yes."
53:30;53:34;"When we do this summit, I think Kenny and Pat, they'll--"
53:34;53:39;"yeah, you get older and you get a little less passionate about issues of taste,"
53:39;53:42;"and they'll probably just relate to each other as just 2 woodshedders."
53:42;53:48;"Also, jazz has receded as a kind of ascendant cultural art form."
53:48;53:54;"In the late 20th century, we were still at the tail end of the jazz era,"
53:54;53:58;"where if Kenny G and Pat Matheny are coming up in the 70s,"
53:58;54:03;"they're right after the fusion period of Miles and all that."
54:03;54:06;"But now we're 50 years past all that,"
54:06;54:11;"so it's sort of like those very vital aesthetic arguments"
54:11;54:17;"that almost kind of religious arguments that Matheny and Kenny G were representing"
54:17;54:20;"in their polar opposite approaches."
54:20;54:22;"The waters have sort of settled."
54:22;54:25;"I understand well, and you may feel that way,"
54:25;54:27;"and in certain circles you may be right, but not in his circles."
54:27;54:28;"He's--"
54:28;54:29;"It's still--"
54:29;54:32;"It's still a spiritual thing."
54:32;54:37;"It's still a deep commitment and a deep aesthetic consciousness"
54:37;54:41;"regarding the jazz scene."
54:41;54:42;"And so--"
54:42;54:43;"I mean, that's great."
54:43;54:44;"I mean, you know."
54:44;54:45;"It is."
54:45;54:49;"It's virtual religion to these people."
54:49;54:53;"You know, I made a jazz record in '07 with Christian McBride and Jack DeJanette,"
54:53;54:55;"and Jack is a guy-- Jack came up."
54:55;54:58;"In fact, there's a great record I have right here."
54:58;55:00;"Speaking of them."
55:00;55:02;"Were you guys ever into the EC-- Can you see this record?"
55:02;55:03;"It's called--"
55:03;55:04;"Yeah."
55:04;55:07;"--New High, G-N-U High."
55:07;55:11;"The record by a trumpet player named Kenny Wheeler and Manfred Eicher,"
55:11;55:14;"the ECM guy, the head of ECM."
55:14;55:16;"He had a lot of cool with these amazing guys."
55:16;55:19;"You see the other names, Keith Tiarat, Dave Holland, and Jack DeJanette."
55:19;55:22;"This is a fantastic record, by the way."
55:22;55:28;"And supposedly the story has it that Manfred Eicher got Keith to play on the record,"
55:28;55:31;"but I guess he wasn't that into it, so he--"
55:31;55:32;"The story has it."
55:32;55:35;"Now, don't quote me on this because this is just what I've heard,"
55:35;55:39;"so it could be completely apocryphal, but it may also be true."
55:39;55:41;"That Keith-- I don't know if you knew Kenny Wheeler,"
55:41;55:45;"but he knew and had played with Dave Holland and Jack DeJanette for years."
55:45;55:49;"Jack DeJanette, he played with Keith for 50 years, you know,"
55:49;55:54;"in various-- from Charles Lloyd all the way up through the Keith Tiarat trio"
55:54;55:56;"with Gary Peacock and Jack."
55:56;56:00;"Supposedly Keith walked into the session, walked to the piano."
56:00;56:02;"There was some charts there, lead sheets."
56:02;56:06;"Didn't speak to anyone the entire time."
56:06;56:13;"Played his ass off, played so beautifully like Keith does and always has."
56:13;56:19;"And then when it was over, walked out, never spoke to anyone."
56:19;56:23;"It's interesting to know that when listening to ""New High"""
56:23;56:28;"because his playing transcended on that."
56:28;56:30;"Didn't need to talk."
56:30;56:33;"He did his talking with his playing and always did."
56:33;56:38;"You know, he was-- I have a son named Keith, and that's who he's named for."
56:38;56:41;"Son named Russell, named for Leon Russell."
56:41;56:44;"And we just like the names, too, you know."
56:44;56:47;"I wanted to go with Keith and Leon, but my wife wasn't feeling Leon."
56:47;56:51;"So Russell was good."
56:54;56:57;"[trombone solo]"
57:13;57:15;"(jazz music)"
57:44;57:46;"- Hey, Ezra, you saw that Keith told me"
57:46;57:50;"that you reposted his Instagram post"
57:50;57:52;"about ""Sidelines,"" about our--"
57:52;57:54;"- Oh yeah, yeah, that was cool"
57:54;57:57;"that your son was shouting out the song"
57:57;58:00;"and saying something nice about me being a part of it."
58:00;58:02;"Well, yeah, and I was about to pivot to that"
58:02;58:06;"'cause, yeah, I wanted to cover ""Horsemeat"" and Kenny G."
58:06;58:09;"Okay, now we should, I guess I'm through my checklist."
58:09;58:11;"Now we can talk about the new song."
58:11;58:12;"- Yes."
58:12;58:14;"- First of all, I'm so thrilled"
58:14;58:16;"that you invited me to be a part of the song."
58:16;58:19;"Should we just listen to it first?"
58:19;58:20;"- Matt, throw it on."
58:20;58:21;"- Well, you can if you want."
58:21;58:23;"Before we listen to it, let me just say this, okay?"
58:23;58:26;"You and Arielle did a session together."
58:26;58:27;"I had never heard it,"
58:27;58:30;"and then the three of us got together last year,"
58:30;58:31;"last May or so."
58:31;58:34;"We did the verses, but when I heard later on,"
58:34;58:38;"'cause I didn't hear them until you guys sent me this stuff,"
58:38;58:40;"when I heard your choruses,"
58:40;58:43;"I thought, ""Well, my choruses, I like them."
58:43;58:44;"They're fine, they're pretty good."""
58:44;58:47;"You singing the choruses was a whole different feeling,"
58:47;58:49;"and I just said, ""You know what?"
58:49;58:52;"He is now the lead on every chorus that he sings on."""
58:52;58:55;"You didn't sing on the first chorus, that's just me."
58:55;58:57;"So it gives the song a place to build,"
58:57;58:58;"a couple of places to go."
58:58;59:03;"And then the breakdown, Jake, he was very creative."
59:03;59:06;"He created his own sort of acapella breakdown,"
59:06;59:09;"or at least that's how we used it."
59:09;59:10;"We were playing it live, Ezra,"
59:10;59:13;"and we're not doing that part."
59:13;59:18;"It's so complex, and the range is two octaves plus."
59:18;59:20;"(Ezra howls)"
59:20;59:22;"- Oh yeah, we were having some fun."
59:22;59:24;"- We said, ""We're not tackling this."
59:24;59:25;"We're gonna do it."
59:25;59:26;"We're not gonna do it like the record."
59:26;59:29;"We're gonna do it the way the record was before."""
59:29;59:32;"You forced the issue with this great new section"
59:32;59:37;"that we just inserted as sort of a prelude"
59:37;59:38;"to the third chorus."
59:38;59:39;"So there you go."
59:39;59:43;"So yeah, this is, it has my name first."
59:43;59:45;"It should probably be your name first, really."
59:45;59:46;"- Oh, no, no, no."
59:46;59:47;"I mean, you guided me."
59:47;59:50;"It's actually really fun too,"
59:50;59:52;"because most of what I do is just Vampire Weekend,"
59:52;59:56;"to actually hear a song and just do my best"
59:56;59:58;"to kind of just sing it."
59:58;59:59;"You already had all the lyrics,"
59:59;01:00:01;"I think that's great lyrics."
01:00:01;01:00:03;"Yeah, I mean, the first time you sent me the demo,"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"I was like, ""Oh, this is a great song."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"Love to be a part of it."""
01:00:06;01:00:08;"Well, yeah, let's throw it on."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"Blake Mills is-"
01:00:09;01:00:12;"- Oh yeah, and Blake Mills, big part of the song, right?"

01:03:37;01:03:39;"Yeah, I really think it turned out great, Bruce."
01:03:39;01:03:42;"Yeah, really psyched to be a part of it."
01:03:42;01:03:45;"I'm curious, like, so how did the lyrics start?"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"You wrote the lyrics with Blake Mills?"
01:03:47;01:03:50;"- No, no, the song, the origin story,"
01:03:50;01:03:53;"the genesis story of the song is this."
01:03:53;01:03:57;"I was making the Absolute Zero record in 2018,"
01:03:57;01:04:02;"and there's a song on there Justin sang fantastically on it."
01:04:02;01:04:04;"It's called ""Meds."""
01:04:04;01:04:06;"So we got Blake to play on it."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"You know, Blake and Tony have their business"
01:04:08;01:04:11;"out at Sound City, and they run it together"
01:04:11;01:04:12;"out in the Valley."
01:04:12;01:04:15;"And so we're setting up for Blake,"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"setting the engineers out of the studio,"
01:04:17;01:04:20;"doing something with Blake's amp, whatever, biking it up."
01:04:20;01:04:23;"And so it's just Blake and I in the control room,"
01:04:23;01:04:28;"and he's kind of jamming along to the same,"
01:04:28;01:04:33;"to a click track for the song, for the ""Meds"" song."
01:04:33;01:04:35;"And he's playing this thing,"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"and I was really taken with it,"
01:04:37;01:04:40;"just sort of hypnotic and beautiful."
01:04:40;01:04:42;"I said, ""Hey, Blake, would you just press record"
01:04:42;01:04:45;"""and just record a little bit of that for me?"
01:04:45;01:04:48;"""I think I feel like I can do something with that."""
01:04:48;01:04:49;"And so he did."
01:04:49;01:04:54;"And so then fast forward to the shutdown,"
01:04:54;01:04:57;"the beginning of the shutdown era, March of 2020."
01:04:57;01:05:01;"All my tours had been postponed or canceled,"
01:05:01;01:05:03;"just like everyone else's."
01:05:03;01:05:04;"And so I can't go anywhere."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"So I thought, ""Well, okay, I'm gonna take the deep dive."""
01:05:06;01:05:08;"Again, I had a sequel to ""Absolute Zero,"""
01:05:08;01:05:11;"""Non-Secure Connection"" coming out in a few months."
01:05:11;01:05:14;"So I said, ""Well, okay, I'm gonna do this again."""
01:05:14;01:05:16;"And so the first, I remember this little,"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"what we called our Blake bit."
01:05:18;01:05:20;"And I said to my engineer,"
01:05:20;01:05:22;"set me up with a session with that,"
01:05:22;01:05:25;"with the click and this thing."
01:05:25;01:05:27;"And so I just wrote to it."
01:05:27;01:05:32;"I turned it on with the click and the guitar part."
01:05:32;01:05:36;"And I just decided to scat the first melody"
01:05:36;01:05:37;"that came into my head."
01:05:37;01:05:41;"So, you know, I'm a bit of a Schoenberg"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"and Euler melodicism kind of guy."
01:05:43;01:05:44;"So I scatted the,"
01:05:44;01:05:47;"(scatting)"
01:05:47;01:06:00;"You know, that melody came intact."
01:06:00;01:06:01;"It was the first time I sang it."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"I listened to it back."
01:06:02;01:06:04;"I said, ""Well, I like that."""
01:06:04;01:06:06;"I don't know if it's a little, again,"
01:06:06;01:06:09;"little angular for the average person,"
01:06:09;01:06:10;"but I don't care about that."
01:06:10;01:06:13;"I thought it was arresting to me, interesting, unique."
01:06:13;01:06:17;"And so that went from there and that's how it happened."
01:06:17;01:06:18;"So then I wrote the lyrics."
01:06:18;01:06:21;"And so we're in this shutdown era,"
01:06:21;01:06:25;"this COVID pandemic, beginning of the pandemic."
01:06:25;01:06:26;"And so I thought,"
01:06:26;01:06:30;"""Well, this is a bit of hysteria going on."""
01:06:30;01:06:32;"It's funny because the third verse,"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"if you remember,"
01:06:34;01:06:37;"there was a big fear at first about surfaces."
01:06:37;01:06:38;"- Oh, right."
01:06:38;01:06:39;"Every surface lethal."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"- Now every surface lethal,"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"wipe it down and change your mood."
01:06:43;01:06:44;"You know, you'll be less fearful"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"after you wipe down your whole kitchen,"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"you know, that whole idea."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"But I didn't want to make it so specifically"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"the whole song about this thing."
01:06:52;01:06:57;"So I made it just about various types of hysteria."
01:06:57;01:06:59;"The first verse being obviously"
01:06:59;01:07:00;"the Salem Witch Trials,"
01:07:00;01:07:02;"I'm traveling now to Salem."
01:07:02;01:07:05;"I'm a judge in a jury trial, et cetera."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"But the second verse is the most odd."
01:07:07;01:07:10;"Your verse is the most odd."
01:07:10;01:07:12;"It comes out of,"
01:07:12;01:07:14;"I'm a big Don DeLillo guy."
01:07:14;01:07:19;"Okay, so here's my DeLillo section,"
01:07:19;01:07:23;"which goes all the way across."
01:07:23;01:07:27;"A lot, up to the pinch and then learn."
01:07:27;01:07:29;"So in his great book, ""Underworld,"""
01:07:29;01:07:31;"I think it may be my favorite of his."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"He's got so many that I love."
01:07:33;01:07:36;"There was a bit in there about"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"this person just driving around"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"and getting into this strange mindset"
01:07:40;01:07:43;"where he sees, it takes place,"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"a guy's going to airport where you're passing"
01:07:45;01:07:48;"all these billboards for rental cars"
01:07:48;01:07:51;"and tires and chains and Applebee's."
01:07:51;01:07:54;"And then all of a sudden in real life,"
01:07:54;01:07:56;"everything he's seeing on the billboards"
01:07:56;01:07:59;"is not everything he sees happening in front of him."
01:07:59;01:08:04;"So that's just a very obtuse, inscrutable,"
01:08:04;01:08:09;"semi-inscrutable idea of one person's hysteria."
01:08:09;01:08:12;"So that's the most out verse."
01:08:12;01:08:13;"- Right, but now, yeah, but I see,"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"they're all linked by hysteria."
01:08:15;01:08:17;"It's good to have an out verse though."
01:08:17;01:08:19;"- Look, I'm not--"
01:08:19;01:08:20;"- Otherwise it's too by the,"
01:08:20;01:08:21;"kind of paint by numbers."
01:08:21;01:08:22;"- Absolutely."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"- That's right, exactly right."
01:08:24;01:08:25;"Realist painting."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"You want a little Krasner in there."
01:08:27;01:08:29;"- Yeah, you need some weirdness."
01:08:29;01:08:32;"- You need some Lee Krasner, not all Edward Hopper."
01:08:32;01:08:35;"- And I think you got a great balance in the lyrics"
01:08:35;01:08:38;"'cause you could foresee if it just felt"
01:08:38;01:08:41;"like a COVID song coming out now,"
01:08:41;01:08:43;"it'd be like, nobody wants to think about it,"
01:08:43;01:08:47;"but you have this kind of oblique reference to it,"
01:08:47;01:08:50;"which people will always serve as a reminder,"
01:08:50;01:08:51;"people listening to the future."
01:08:51;01:08:52;"But I love the opening,"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"just opening with this kind of Salem"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"witch trials, like,"
01:08:56;01:08:58;"♪ I'm traveling down to Salem ♪"
01:08:58;01:09:01;"♪ I'm a judge in a jury trial ♪"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"'Cause also, there's something about where you're like,"
01:09:03;01:09:06;"so is this taking place in like the 17th century?"
01:09:06;01:09:09;"Or, you know, Salem is still a town in Massachusetts."
01:09:09;01:09:12;"Maybe it's just some dude in modern day Massachusetts"
01:09:12;01:09:15;"who's just got to get down to Salem for a trial."
01:09:15;01:09:16;"And it's got this like,"
01:09:16;01:09:19;"kind of weird caught between worlds feeling."
01:09:19;01:09:20;"And that actually brings me to one other thing"
01:09:20;01:09:21;"that I was kind of interested in."
01:09:21;01:09:26;"So this upcoming album is part of this trilogy."
01:09:26;01:09:27;"- Yes."
01:09:27;01:09:29;"- Talking about the last one, ""Non-Secure Connection."""
01:09:29;01:09:32;"And so much of it has to do with a lot of the language"
01:09:32;01:09:37;"and the lyrics and the themes are about technology,"
01:09:37;01:09:40;"hysteria, science, paranoia."
01:09:40;01:09:42;"And so it's interesting to me that you're a big like,"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"Delilo fan and stuff like that,"
01:09:44;01:09:45;"'cause your work is known,"
01:09:45;01:09:47;"especially your early work for not being shy"
01:09:47;01:09:51;"about trying new technology, new sense and things like that."
01:09:51;01:09:54;"But it's interesting to me that you live out in the woods."
01:09:54;01:09:58;"As you said, you spend a lot of time playing piano,"
01:09:58;01:10:01;"an instrument that's hundreds of years old,"
01:10:01;01:10:03;"and yet you're also so interested"
01:10:03;01:10:08;"in this kind of like technological world."
01:10:08;01:10:10;"So I'm curious how that plays out in your life."
01:10:10;01:10:13;"Are you kind of like, by living out in nature"
01:10:13;01:10:16;"and kind of like dedicating yourself to a craft"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"that's existed for a long time,"
01:10:18;01:10:19;"is there like a tension in your life"
01:10:19;01:10:24;"between traditionalism and the strange world that we live in?"
01:10:24;01:10:28;"Are you critical of it in your work?"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"It's an interesting juxtaposition."
01:10:30;01:10:33;"- Well, that's a multi-tiered question."
01:10:33;01:10:34;"So let me try to answer it"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"with a couple of different answers."
01:10:36;01:10:40;"Okay, so I don't consider myself to be an intellectual,"
01:10:40;01:10:43;"but I'm truly intellectually curious."
01:10:43;01:10:47;"And I'm really interested in everything"
01:10:47;01:10:52;"from string theory to ornithology,"
01:10:52;01:10:55;"everything from the Large Hadron Collider"
01:10:55;01:10:58;"to the flight patterns of the hummingbirds,"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"you know, whatever."
01:11:00;01:11:03;"And I'm also a big devotee"
01:11:03;01:11:06;"of what Asnob would call literary fiction."
01:11:06;01:11:11;"And my library here's littered and dotted"
01:11:11;01:11:14;"with the Fransons and Wallaces."
01:11:14;01:11:18;"And so in a way, I'm kind of always working."
01:11:18;01:11:21;"I'm a pretty voracious reader."
01:11:21;01:11:23;"I'm slow as I can be, slow reader."
01:11:23;01:11:25;"Retention, maybe not the best,"
01:11:25;01:11:30;"but what I read about is always influencing my lyric writing."
01:11:30;01:11:32;"The page pretty filled in for me."
01:11:32;01:11:34;"I've been doing this for a long time."
01:11:34;01:11:37;"So another love song, man,"
01:11:37;01:11:41;"I've got to find a very interesting way into that one"
01:11:41;01:11:45;"to not feel like, oh boy, am I doing this again?"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"Why do this again?"
01:11:47;01:11:50;"So I'm not so interested in,"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"okay, so technologically speaking,"
01:11:52;01:11:53;"I guess that's where it comes from."
01:11:53;01:11:56;"I'm just interested in all that, interested in,"
01:11:56;01:11:59;"I love the magazine ""Wired"" for instance."
01:11:59;01:12:02;"There's a song on my, the ""Non-Secure Connection"" record"
01:12:02;01:12:06;"called, well, it's the title song, ""Non-Secure Connection."""
01:12:06;01:12:10;"It's about a hacker pulling some fairly nefarious deeds"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"out there in his hovel where he lives,"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"this dark cave where he's hanging out."
01:12:14;01:12:17;"I guess I'm channeling the Nina Simone edict"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"that the artists should write"
01:12:19;01:12:22;"about the times in which they live."
01:12:22;01:12:27;"And so I take that as, and run with that."
01:12:27;01:12:30;"Also on a record of making level though,"
01:12:30;01:12:35;"I was kind of turned out by this deep dive"
01:12:35;01:12:39;"into the Justin Vernon Bon Iver world."
01:12:39;01:12:41;"And then meeting Ariel and you,"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"because it's a similar thing."
01:12:43;01:12:46;"People who are really interested in an intense search"
01:12:46;01:12:50;"for new sounds, for new ways of doing things."
01:12:50;01:12:53;"So I'm just totally interested in all that too."
01:12:53;01:12:56;"Whereas before maybe I was more of a traditionalist."
01:12:56;01:13:01;"I made a really weird record in 2001 called ""Big Swing Face"""
01:13:01;01:13:05;"where my A&R guy challenged me"
01:13:05;01:13:08;"to make a modern quote unquote record."
01:13:08;01:13:09;"And it was that."
01:13:09;01:13:12;"I call it sort of my electronica blues record."
01:13:12;01:13:14;"For some people it was the first Bruce Hornby record"
01:13:14;01:13:15;"they'd ever liked."
01:13:15;01:13:18;"For other people it was like KG in the jazz world,"
01:13:18;01:13:19;"anathema to them."
01:13:19;01:13:20;"(laughing)"
01:13:20;01:13:23;"So for most- - Wow, divisive."
01:13:23;01:13:26;"- Yeah, it was very divisive, yes."
01:13:26;01:13:27;"I'm still proud of it."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"Yeah, if you heard the first song,"
01:13:28;01:13:29;"it's called ""Sticks and Stones."""
01:13:29;01:13:31;"I love the song ""Sticks and Stones."""
01:13:31;01:13:33;"I like playing a solo piano"
01:13:33;01:13:36;"and I feel like it really can really get it right."
01:13:36;01:13:39;"But the record is interesting too."
01:13:39;01:13:42;"I was inspired by the radio head record"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"""Everything in Its Right Place."""
01:13:44;01:13:45;"I think I-"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"♪ Everything ♪ - Oh yeah, on Kid A."
01:13:47;01:13:51;"- So I'm just, again, I'm curious"
01:13:51;01:13:55;"and interested in loads of bollocks out there."
01:13:55;01:13:58;"And so that's my answer."
01:13:58;01:14:00;"- Did you read that new ""Francine"" novel?"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"- I did, ""Crossroads."""
01:14:02;01:14:02;"I like it."
01:14:02;01:14:03;"- Yeah."
01:14:03;01:14:04;"- I like ""Francine."""
01:14:04;01:14:06;"I've read, look, I've read the four"
01:14:07;01:14:10;"since, oh come on, ""Corrections."""
01:14:10;01:14:11;"- Yeah."
01:14:11;01:14:14;"- ""Corrections,"" freedom, purity."
01:14:14;01:14:17;"It's funny 'cause purity's probably thought of"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"as the lesser of the four."
01:14:19;01:14:21;"It might be my favorite."
01:14:21;01:14:22;"I really liked purity."
01:14:22;01:14:25;"I liked ""Crossroads"" as well."
01:14:25;01:14:26;"I relate."
01:14:26;01:14:29;"I grew up in this small conservative town"
01:14:29;01:14:33;"where young life's religious groups did abound."
01:14:33;01:14:35;"And I was in one of them for a while"
01:14:35;01:14:38;"just 'cause the most beautiful girls in my high school"
01:14:38;01:14:42;"were in it, so that was my entree."
01:14:42;01:14:44;"That and hoops was my only way"
01:14:44;01:14:47;"of being able to hang with those lovelies."
01:14:47;01:14:49;"My standard line about myself is I got a lot better looking"
01:14:49;01:14:51;"when I got into a popular band."
01:14:51;01:14:54;"So this was a necessary thing to be into"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"what was called young life back then."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"- Yeah."
01:14:57;01:15:00;"- So right, I related to ""Crossroads."""
01:15:00;01:15:02;"So what'd you think of ""Crossroads,"" Jake?"
01:15:02;01:15:03;"- I loved it."
01:15:03;01:15:05;"I mean, I think he's writing sequels to it."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"So I'm excited."
01:15:07;01:15:09;"I do like his work a little bit more"
01:15:09;01:15:11;"when he's writing about contemporary life."
01:15:11;01:15:14;"Like I loved ""Freedom"" and I love ""Purity"" too."
01:15:14;01:15:17;"But so I was a little bit apprehensive with ""Crossroads"""
01:15:17;01:15:18;"'cause it was set in the '70s."
01:15:18;01:15:21;"And I was like, okay, I've seen enough things about,"
01:15:21;01:15:23;"I've read and seen enough movies about the '70s,"
01:15:23;01:15:25;"but I got into it."
01:15:25;01:15:26;"It's awesome."
01:15:26;01:15:28;"- I've never read any ""Franzen,"""
01:15:28;01:15:31;"but I'm surrounded by huge ""Franzen"" heads."
01:15:31;01:15:33;"- Yeah, 'cause Rasheed's a big ""Franzen"" head too, right?"
01:15:33;01:15:34;"- Yeah."
01:15:34;01:15:36;"- That's why it's at a high level."
01:15:36;01:15:38;"It's very articulate."
01:15:38;01:15:40;"He's also real funny."
01:15:40;01:15:41;"- Yeah, I'm a fan."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"- They're not difficult reads."
01:15:43;01:15:45;"They're not thick like some,"
01:15:45;01:15:48;"like say, trying to get through ""Gravity's Rainbow"""
01:15:48;01:15:49;"or ""Infinite Jest."""
01:15:49;01:15:50;"That's a little tough for me."
01:15:50;01:15:52;"I love more."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"I have a harder time with those."
01:15:54;01:16:00;"My favorite Wallace are the essays."
01:16:00;01:16:02;"Really funny, really great."
01:16:02;01:16:03;"- Oh, for sure."
01:16:03;01:16:04;"- A funny thing,"
01:16:04;01:16:07;"a supposedly fun thing I'll never do again."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"- Oh, classic."
01:16:08;01:16:09;"- Just great."
01:16:09;01:16:10;"- Classic."
01:16:10;01:16:14;"- I love him, but some of it's a little thick,"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"and I don't find that with ""Franzen."""
01:16:16;01:16:18;"I understand that his earlier works"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"before ""Corrections"" were more like that."
01:16:20;01:16:23;"He was really trying to be Wallace and Pynchon."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"So I'm not drawn to that."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"Maybe I'm wrong."
01:16:27;01:16:29;"Maybe I'll need to give it a chance and we'll love it."
01:16:29;01:16:30;"So who knows?"
01:16:30;01:16:31;"But yeah."
01:16:31;01:16:33;"- Thanks so much, Bruce, for coming through."
01:16:33;01:16:34;"Always a pleasure."
01:16:34;01:16:37;"Now you've been on ""Time Crisis"" three times."
01:16:37;01:16:38;"So you're starting to get into the ranks"
01:16:38;01:16:40;"of serious guests. - Three?"
01:16:40;01:16:42;"- 'Cause we've done two in-depth interviews,"
01:16:42;01:16:43;"and remember when you were kind enough"
01:16:43;01:16:45;"we called you last minute?"
01:16:45;01:16:48;"Like when you were just on tour?"
01:16:48;01:16:53;"- Regarding the supposed first podcast ever."
01:16:53;01:16:54;"- ""The Dead,"" yeah."
01:16:54;01:16:56;"- Is that still thought of?"
01:16:56;01:17:00;"Has anyone come to reclaim the title of first podcast?"
01:17:00;01:17:01;"- No. - No."
01:17:01;01:17:04;"The first podcast is ""A Grateful Dead Song."""
01:17:04;01:17:06;"The first podcast is ""A Grateful Dead Song."""
01:17:06;01:17:07;"Make of that what you will."
01:17:07;01:17:12;"If you discount women who are married to ""Time Crisis"" hosts,"
01:17:12;01:17:16;"you're really up there, Bruce,"
01:17:16;01:17:19;"in terms of multiple guests we've had on this show."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"- That's true."
01:17:20;01:17:21;"What a moment for me."
01:17:21;01:17:23;"No, I'm happy to- - This is big."
01:17:23;01:17:26;"- I thought it was a pleasure to check in with you guys."
01:17:26;01:17:30;"So just let me know when the next time can happen."
01:17:31;01:17:32;"I'm all for it."
01:17:32;01:17:36;"And Jake, please send me that book."
01:17:36;01:17:37;"- Oh yeah, I'll connect you guys."

01:20:28;01:20:30;"and I wanna point something out."
01:20:30;01:20:35;"We did a whole long segment with legendary Bruce Hornsby,"
01:20:35;01:20:37;"and you know what we didn't bring up once?"
01:20:37;01:20:38;"- The dead."
01:20:38;01:20:39;"- The dead."
01:20:39;01:20:40;"I'm proud of us."
01:20:40;01:20:42;"- I'm hoping horse meat becomes our dead."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"You know what I mean?"
01:20:43;01:20:44;"- Oh, absolutely not."
01:20:44;01:20:45;"(laughing)"
01:20:45;01:20:46;"I will resign from this show."
01:20:46;01:20:47;"- Jake is out on that."
01:20:47;01:20:49;"The people had enough of the Grateful Dead,"
01:20:49;01:20:51;"a horse meat's our new go-to."
01:20:51;01:20:52;"- No, the dead is evergreen."
01:20:52;01:20:56;"Horse meat is, there's a short shelf life on horse meat."
01:20:56;01:20:59;"(laughing)"
01:20:59;01:21:00;"- Okay, but could we add horse meat?"
01:21:00;01:21:04;"Maybe horse meat is our new Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
01:21:04;01:21:04;"- There you go."
01:21:04;01:21:06;"- 'Cause I feel like Flamin' Hot Cheetos,"
01:21:06;01:21:10;"we reached such a climax with the investigative journalism"
01:21:10;01:21:13;"from the LA Times trying to take down Richard Montanez,"
01:21:13;01:21:15;"even though he clearly survived."
01:21:15;01:21:18;"But I feel like that was the end of our Hot Cheetos journey."
01:21:18;01:21:20;"So yeah, I feel like in the future,"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"next time we have on some Luminary,"
01:21:22;01:21:25;"we can just do a kind of lightning round,"
01:21:25;01:21:28;"you know, and we're interviewing whoever that might be."
01:21:28;01:21:30;"- Jonathan Franzen."
01:21:30;01:21:32;"- Yeah, when Jonathan Franzen comes on,"
01:21:32;01:21:35;"or Hillary Clinton, you know,"
01:21:35;01:21:36;"next time we get a heavy hitter, we're just like,"
01:21:36;01:21:37;"all right, just to kick things off,"
01:21:37;01:21:41;"just to get you warmed up, Madam Secretary,"
01:21:41;01:21:42;"A, do you like the Grateful Dead?"
01:21:42;01:21:45;"Well, you know, I remember they were,"
01:21:45;01:21:48;"yeah, they came by the White House when Bill was president."
01:21:48;01:21:52;"And of course, one of their keyboardists, Bruce Hornsby,"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"he played the Arkansas ball twice."
01:21:54;01:21:55;"Of course, I'm familiar with him."
01:21:55;01:21:57;"And got any favorite songs?"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"Ah, you know, Truckin'."
01:21:59;01:22:01;"All right, very cool, very cool."
01:22:01;01:22:03;"Have you ever eaten horse meat?"
01:22:03;01:22:06;"Oh, well, once."
01:22:06;01:22:07;"Or you know, that'll become our new,"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"just like go-to lightning round."
01:22:09;01:22:10;"- Our five questions."
01:22:10;01:22:14;"I like the idea of having President Joe Biden on,"
01:22:14;01:22:17;"and it's only about horse meat."
01:22:17;01:22:22;"- I'm telling you, it's not looking good for the Dems"
01:22:22;01:22:24;"with the whole horse meat issue."
01:22:24;01:22:26;"A lot of people saying the Bidens are corrupt"
01:22:26;01:22:31;"because his little brother pressured him to get the votes"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"all at the behest of one oil heiress."
01:22:33;01:22:34;"- Thank you, Biden."
01:22:34;01:22:40;"- It's time for the Top Five on iTunes."
01:22:40;01:22:46;"- This week on the Top Five,"
01:22:46;01:22:51;"we're comparing the top five songs of 2022 on Apple Music"
01:22:51;01:22:54;"with the top five Billboard hits of 1988."
01:22:54;01:22:56;"Why 1988?"
01:22:56;01:22:57;"'Cause that's when Bruce started"
01:22:57;01:23:01;"♪ Playing, playing in the band ♪"
01:23:01;01:23:05;"- Which is funny 'cause as we discussed,"
01:23:05;01:23:07;"we did not talk about The Grateful Dead once"
01:23:07;01:23:10;"with Bruce Hornsby on the program."
01:23:10;01:23:12;"Little random that we're taking it back to '88,"
01:23:12;01:23:16;"but '88 was just a banner year for Hornsby."
01:23:16;01:23:18;"- Yeah, I'm excited about a top five from '88."
01:23:18;01:23:22;"I love '80s top fives, so I'm on board."
01:23:22;01:23:24;"- I don't know if we've done '88 any time recently."
01:23:24;01:23:27;"So the number five song this week in '88,"
01:23:27;01:23:31;"an absolute classic, Terrence Trent Darby with ""Wishing Well."""
01:23:31;01:23:36;"- This is the first tape I ever bought."

01:24:58;01:25:00;"Is this his one big hit?"
01:25:00;01:25:02;"- I don't know anything about this guy at all."
01:25:02;01:25:03;"- Yeah, I mean, he's kind of like,"
01:25:03;01:25:07;"he's a little bit Prince, a little bit rock."
01:25:07;01:25:09;"Kind of an interesting story that before he was a musician,"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"he was trained as a boxer"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"in one of the Florida Golden Gloves"
01:25:13;01:25:15;"Lightweight Championship in 1980."
01:25:15;01:25:16;"He enlisted in the army the next year,"
01:25:16;01:25:20;"but was court-martialed and dishonorably discharged"
01:25:20;01:25:23;"after going absent without leave."
01:25:23;01:25:24;"Then he signed a record deal."
01:25:24;01:25:26;"I just feel like there's all these stories"
01:25:26;01:25:29;"that he was kind of like a really arrogant guy,"
01:25:29;01:25:32;"like burned a lot of bridges or something."
01:25:32;01:25:37;"And then he changed his name to Sananda Francesco Maitreya,"

01:25:57;01:25:58;"Had a few other hits."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"This is far and away the biggest hit."
01:26:00;01:26:02;"I guess he was just kind of like,"
01:26:02;01:26:04;"he was just on some like Kanye (beep)"
01:26:04;01:26:07;"He would just speak very highly about himself."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"He would do interviews when this album came out"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"claiming it was the most important album"
01:26:11;01:26:12;"since Sergeant Pepper."
01:26:14;01:26:16;"- That's amazing."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"He was fired up."
01:26:17;01:26:18;"- Yeah, why not?"
01:26:18;01:26:20;"He later said that most of what he said"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"was exaggerated by the press,"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"but sometimes it's necessary to hit people over the head"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"to get their attention."
01:26:26;01:26:27;"I mean, he's right."
01:26:27;01:26:28;"Why not?"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"So I guess just what happened?"
01:26:30;01:26:31;"Why did he not like,"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"I guess he just didn't maintain"
01:26:33;01:26:37;"like the hit making capacity."
01:26:37;01:26:38;"- Times changed."
01:26:38;01:26:41;"- Yeah, I guess the follow-up albums were not quite as big."
01:26:41;01:26:45;"In 1995, he dropped an album called Vibrator"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"and then just straight up changed his name."
01:26:47;01:26:48;"- Vibrator."
01:26:48;01:26:50;"- Vibrator didn't land?"
01:26:50;01:26:50;"- Let me see."
01:26:50;01:26:52;"What's up with Vibrator?"
01:26:52;01:26:53;"- It's okay."
01:26:53;01:26:55;"It's not like amazing."
01:26:55;01:26:58;"He was clearly just like feeling himself"
01:26:58;01:26:59;"and like out of his mind."
01:26:59;01:27:02;"'Cause like Wishing Well, it's okay."
01:27:02;01:27:05;"It's like, that's a B at best."
01:27:05;01:27:06;"- Wow, can we drop a bomb to that?"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"(explosion)"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"- No, Wishing Well's like an A."
01:27:10;01:27:11;"I think Wishing Well's Earth's End."
01:27:11;01:27:12;"- No, it's not an A."
01:27:12;01:27:13;"- I think Wishing Well's an A."
01:27:13;01:27:16;"I also think that, do you know what he looks like, Jake?"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"- No, I have no idea."
01:27:18;01:27:19;"- He's beautiful."
01:27:19;01:27:22;"And you're talking about 1988 and MTV."
01:27:22;01:27:25;"I feel like a lot was happening around him for this."
01:27:25;01:27:26;"I mean."
01:27:26;01:27:28;"- I was watching a lot of MTV in 1988"
01:27:28;01:27:30;"and I don't remember this guy at all."
01:27:30;01:27:32;"That was the peak of my."
01:27:32;01:27:33;"- This is the number one hit."
01:27:33;01:27:35;"Were they not playing the video?"
01:27:35;01:27:36;"Yeah, he's very handsome."
01:27:36;01:27:37;"- They were."
01:27:37;01:27:38;"I'm saying, I know this from the video."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"- Okay."
01:27:39;01:27:43;"- I'm nine years old in '88 and I'm seeing this."
01:27:43;01:27:44;"I'm like, ""Oh, I gotta buy this."""
01:27:44;01:27:46;"- I'm a little bit younger than you guys."
01:27:46;01:27:48;"So the first Terrence Trent Darby album"
01:27:48;01:27:50;"I got into is Vibrator."
01:27:50;01:27:54;"It's also technically called Vibrator"
01:27:54;01:27:56;"and then in parentheses, batteries included."
01:27:56;01:27:59;"(laughing)"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"I'm just curious what his music sounded like in '95."
01:28:01;01:28:02;"Can you just throw on the title track from Vibrator?"
01:28:02;01:28:04;"- He looks corny as hell."
01:28:04;01:28:05;"I'm Google image searching."
01:28:05;01:28:07;"He looks corny as hell."
01:28:07;01:28:08;"- It's like a Billy Vandille type of."
01:28:08;01:28:10;"- Yeah, it's very Milly Vanille."
01:28:10;01:28:11;"And maybe like that didn't help."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"- Well, you can't knock him just 'cause he looks like."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"They cast the Milly Vanille guys"
01:28:15;01:28:16;"'cause they were good looking."
01:28:16;01:28:17;"- Or they looked like Terrence."
01:28:17;01:28:18;"- They looked like Terrence Trent Darby."
01:28:18;01:28:20;"- Honestly, hot take."
01:28:20;01:28:22;"Milly Vanille, better songs."
01:28:22;01:28:23;"- Oh my God."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"- Okay, but they didn't write them."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"- I don't care."
01:28:26;01:28:28;"- Or sing them."
01:28:28;01:28:28;"- Who cares?"
01:28:32;01:28:33;"Oh, this sounds rough."
01:28:33;01:28:36;"Great snare tone."
01:28:38;01:28:47;"Oh yeah, a little D and B."

01:28:57;01:28:57;"- '95."

01:35:41;01:35:42;"- Yeah, only kind of, if I'm honest."
01:35:42;01:35:44;"- I listen to a lot more classic rock radio"

01:36:14;01:36:16;"- Maybe I'm just wrong and it was like 500."
01:36:16;01:36:17;"That's actually like way more."
01:36:17;01:36:20;"- Are you going to the 38 show tonight?"
01:36:20;01:36:21;"Now I'm just curious, like,"
01:36:21;01:36:22;"what is the story with this band?"
01:36:22;01:36:24;"- They're from J-Ville."
01:36:24;01:36:26;"- But like, what year do they start?"
01:36:26;01:36:28;"- Well, and they have a Leonard Skinner connection."
01:36:28;01:36:29;"- '74?"
01:36:29;01:36:35;"- 'Cause Donny Van Zant, Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother,"
01:36:35;01:36:39;"I guess like founded 38 special."
01:36:39;01:36:40;"- Wow."
01:36:40;01:36:43;"- And they got their name, this is pretty tight."
01:36:43;01:36:45;"- The band's name was thought up after an incident"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"which found the boys practicing in a warehouse"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"out in the middle of nowhere."
01:36:49;01:36:51;"When police arrived after being notified"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"by locals of the noise,"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"the band members were unable to come out"
01:36:55;01:36:58;"because of a padlock on the door."
01:36:58;01:37:01;"One of the cops said, ""That's all right."
01:37:01;01:37:03;"We'll let this 38 special do the talking."""
01:37:03;01:37:05;"And shot off the lock."
01:37:05;01:37:06;"- That's very Skinner."
01:37:06;01:37:10;"- 38 special played at Florida theater in 2020,"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"capacity 1900."
01:37:12;01:37:14;"- If you're only selling 1900 tickets"
01:37:14;01:37:16;"and you got a 5,000 person guest list,"
01:37:16;01:37:18;"you gotta get that guest list shorter."
01:37:18;01:37:20;"Some of those people would probably buy tickets."
01:37:20;01:37:22;"- I mean, 5,000 people is that nobody knows,"
01:37:22;01:37:26;"there's people that nobody knows that are on the guest list."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"- The more I think about this, there's no way it's true."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"It must've been 500."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"- Yeah, it's funny this has no sub,"
01:37:31;01:37:34;"no trace of Southern heritage at all."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"This band could be from like Maine."
01:37:36;01:37:38;"- Oh, it totally."
01:37:38;01:37:39;"They could be from Canada."
01:37:39;01:37:42;"They could be from California."
01:37:42;01:37:43;"- Scotland."
01:37:43;01:37:44;"- Yeah, yeah, truly."
01:37:44;01:37:46;"It could be from Scotland."
01:37:46;01:37:50;"I'm sure as I explore their catalog,"
01:37:50;01:37:53;"I'll find some more of the Southern rock sound."
01:37:53;01:37:55;"- You should probably also find like a 300 page book"
01:37:55;01:37:59;"on 38 special and Donny Van Zandt."
01:37:59;01:38:03;"- Maybe I'm just thinking of the Wahlbergs,"
01:38:03;01:38:08;"but Donny is such like a name for like the other brother."
01:38:08;01:38:10;"Like it's like, oh man, you know,"
01:38:10;01:38:15;"we got Van Zandt on vocals like Ronnie, Ron, no Donny."
01:38:15;01:38:19;"Or it's like, oh yeah, we've got one of the Wahlbergs,"
01:38:19;01:38:22;"Mark Wahlberg, no Donny Wahlberg."
01:38:22;01:38:25;"Donny is just like a great name for like the other brother."
01:38:25;01:38:29;"- Yeah, come on Donny, let's go get a lane."
01:38:29;01:38:32;"- Yeah, and then of course you got Donny from Big Lebowski."
01:38:32;01:38:33;"- Yeah."
01:38:33;01:38:34;"- Got Donny Longstreth."
01:38:34;01:38:36;"- Donny was a surfer."

01:41:56;01:42:00;"have received four or more hot 100 number ones."
01:42:00;01:42:02;"Paula Abdul's ""Forever Your Girl"" in '88,"
01:42:02;01:42:06;"Janet Jackson ""Rhythm Nation 1814"" in '89,"
01:42:06;01:42:10;"this one, which is also '88,"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"Mariah Carey's self-titled debut in 1990,"
01:42:12;01:42:15;"and Katy Perry's ""Teenage Dream"" in 2010."
01:42:15;01:42:17;"- Wow."
01:42:17;01:42:19;"- That's interesting 'cause even with these"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"Blockbuster artists today,"
01:42:21;01:42:24;"the idea of having multiple four number one singles"
01:42:24;01:42:27;"from your album just doesn't make sense anymore"
01:42:27;01:42:29;"'cause you wouldn't be able to string along"
01:42:29;01:42:32;"a run of singles across two years"
01:42:32;01:42:35;"the same way that they could back in the day."
01:42:35;01:42:37;"It's like Taylor Swift puts out a new album,"
01:42:37;01:42:40;"the fans eat it up, but the idea that"
01:42:40;01:42:41;"three of the songs from that album"
01:42:41;01:42:43;"are gonna go number one over the next 18 months"
01:42:43;01:42:46;"just doesn't really make sense."
01:42:46;01:42:48;"- Or I feel like, yeah, they'll be like"
01:42:48;01:42:52;"seven of the songs will be in the top 10 for two weeks."
01:42:52;01:42:53;"That happens a lot."
01:42:53;01:42:56;"- It's interesting how, yeah,"
01:42:56;01:43:01;"like Whitney, Paula Abdul, Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey,"
01:43:01;01:43:04;"all in that short window between '88 and '90."
01:43:04;01:43:06;"- Burst on the scene."
01:43:06;01:43:07;"- But you're right, there was something about"
01:43:07;01:43:10;"the conditions of the record industry in that time."
01:43:10;01:43:12;"- Yeah, it's like when you look at those"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"Blockbuster Michael Jackson albums from the '80s,"
01:43:14;01:43:16;"for instance, it's always some wild thing"
01:43:16;01:43:20;"like where it's like, oh, ""Bad"" came out, whatever, 1987,"
01:43:20;01:43:24;"and then it's like, in February 1989,"
01:43:24;01:43:28;"""Dirty Diana"" went to radio and raced up the charts."
01:43:28;01:43:30;"It's just like, they could just work it."
01:43:30;01:43:33;"- You know who was probably the last person to do that"
01:43:33;01:43:36;"was Katy Perry, one of those early albums."
01:43:36;01:43:39;"I feel like she had like two years off of one album, yeah."
01:43:39;01:43:40;"- That's the last one in this list,"
01:43:40;01:43:43;"Katy Perry's ""Teenage Dream"" in 2010,"
01:43:43;01:43:45;"where, yeah, you'd be kind of aware of it"
01:43:45;01:43:48;"'cause whatever the first single was like ""California Girls"""
01:43:48;01:43:52;"and then like a year later, like the video just dropped"
01:43:52;01:43:55;"for ""E.T."" (laughs)"

01:44:10;01:44:12;"but we just gotta keep things moving."
01:44:12;01:44:17;"Then we're on the number two song of 1988,"
