00:00;00:04;"Fried chicken sandwiches all around me."
00:04;00:07;"Where should I spend my money?"
00:07;00:16;"Despot, Bruce Hornsby, and the history of the podcast."
00:16;00:20;"This is an internet radio show and it's called..."
00:20;00:25;"TIME CRISIS WITH ESRA KAYNIG"
00:26;00:30;"Time Crisis with Esra Kayning"
00:30;00:37;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:37;00:44;"They were a threat, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:44;00:51;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:52;00:58;"And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go."
00:58;01:03;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:03;01:08;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:08;01:13;"Leave it on me babe."
01:13;01:16;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:16;01:19;"Well Seinfeld, you're stepping up to the big leagues,"
01:20;01:22;"it's only you and me right now."
01:22;01:25;"I'm ready for it man, what's up? What's on the docket?"
01:25;01:28;"We knew Jake was going to be late today, but now we heard he's not feeling well."
01:28;01:31;"And I know he was feeling kind of weird this week."
01:31;01:34;"So, best wishes to Jake."
01:34;01:36;"You gotta rest up."
01:36;01:38;"We miss you man."
01:38;01:41;"We miss you Jake, heart and soul of the program."
01:41;01:44;"But, you're no slouch either Seinfeld."
01:44;01:48;"Oh hell yeah, I'm ready for whatever you throw my way."
01:49;01:52;"I mean, you're kind of like a man of mystery,"
01:52;01:55;"so I guess we can't really do your whole life story."
01:55;01:58;"I mean we've touched on aspects of my life story a little bit."
01:58;02:01;"We did Seinfeld 2000, origin story."
02:01;02:04;"We did, yeah. It was a classic."
02:04;02:07;"Well let me flip it on you, what's up with you?"
02:07;02:09;"What have you been up to?"
02:09;02:11;"Same old, same old."
02:11;02:14;"About to go some places for the first time."
02:14;02:17;"I played tennis for the first time in two years."
02:18;02:19;"Oh wow, how'd it go?"
02:19;02:23;"You know, I think I have some natural talent that I've squandered."
02:23;02:27;"So, I think if I keep playing I'll be able to hold it down."
02:27;02:30;"But, you know, I've been writing some music, reading,"
02:30;02:33;"hanging with the family, friends, getting ready for the summer."
02:33;02:35;"Nothing too exciting."
02:35;02:37;"What are you reading right now?"
02:37;02:41;"Let's see, I was, been reading Carl Jung's memoirs."
02:41;02:43;"Just some light summer fare."
02:43;02:46;"I mean, you know, so far it's pretty mellow."
02:47;02:48;"He grew up in Switzerland, so there's,"
02:48;02:52;"when he wasn't exploring the depths of the collective unconscious,"
02:52;02:57;"he was also, you know, just like, enjoying a childhood in idyllic Switzerland."
02:57;03:01;"Visiting people on the banks of Lake Geneva, things of that nature."
03:01;03:05;"He seems like an interesting cat. I'm excited to learn more about him."
03:05;03:08;"What happened with him and Freud? Was there a falling out?"
03:08;03:12;"Was there just a difference, there was like a theoretical difference between them?"
03:12;03:16;"Or was it an amicable parting of ways? Has it gotten there yet?"
03:16;03:18;"I think it was kind of a Seinfeld and friends thing."
03:18;03:27;"They were back to back on Central European television"
03:27;03:31;"in the first half of the, I think it was actually on Thursday nights,"
03:31;03:33;"which was interesting. And, you know,"
03:33;03:36;"they got a lot of like similar people were interested in what they were both doing."
03:36;03:39;"But they're fundamentally, there was this difference in worldview."
03:39;03:44;"And I think over time, the Freudians and the Jungians just really couldn't hang."
03:45;03:47;"Even though superficially, they seem to have a lot in common."
03:47;03:50;"I just appreciate you putting this in terms that I could understand,"
03:50;03:54;"sort of analogizing it with the Thursday night NBC must see TV lineup."
03:54;03:58;"Because immediately I'm like, okay, I get it. I see what you're saying here."
03:58;04:00;"This is what a good teacher does."
04:00;04:02;"That's right."
04:02;04:04;"I look at each individual student."
04:04;04:10;"Well, you know what? If Time Crisis has any Jungians listening,"
04:10;04:14;"any Jungian analysts, we would love for you to call in"
04:14;04:17;"and maybe do a deep dive on Friends and Seinfeld."
04:17;04:21;"And if you can pull any archetypes from those shows,"
04:21;04:25;"then maybe help explain why they had such a deep appeal."
04:25;04:28;"Because clearly both shows hit something deep in the collective unconscious."
04:28;04:32;"Jerry, George, Kramer, they all represent figures that probably,"
04:32;04:35;"I imagine go back to almost prehistoric times."
04:35;04:37;"Definitely."
04:37;04:41;"Well, this is interesting that we knew that Jake was going to be late,"
04:42;04:45;"and that there was a last minute call on his part, which is okay."
04:45;04:48;"But we got to find our groove."
04:48;04:51;"One thought we had was that it's been a long time"
04:51;04:53;"since we talked to the front of the show, Despot."
04:53;04:56;"So we're going to get him on board and we'll see how long he can hang."
04:56;04:59;"I'm so curious about what his whole..."
04:59;05:02;"Because we haven't talked to him at all during the pandemic, I don't think."
05:02;05:04;"Not since the early pandemic."
05:04;05:07;"Yeah, he was early pandemic."
05:07;05:11;"And we talked about, I think we did some Unabomber."
05:11;05:12;"Oh, that's right."
05:12;05:15;"He must have been like the second call,"
05:15;05:18;"this time crisis or something like that."
05:18;05:20;"It's coming back."
05:20;05:23;"I definitely don't... Jake is great."
05:23;05:25;"And he shall never be replaced."
05:25;05:27;"But I like the idea of this low-key being,"
05:27;05:30;"is this a tryout for second chair?"
05:30;05:33;"You know, I just think we should keep our..."
05:33;05:36;"I'm just saying, you know,"
05:36;05:39;"I definitely don't want to kick a man while he's down and sick."
05:40;05:43;"Well, Despot is sort of the original second chair, right?"
05:43;05:47;"Dating back to the New York days, which I wasn't really part of."
05:47;05:51;"It's hard to believe that Jake is now such a fundamental part of the program"
05:51;05:55;"because the early days, doing it in New York before we really had a vibe,"
05:55;06:00;"there was me, Despot and cousin Asher, who were great."
06:00;06:04;"But even then I was like recording these interviews, like piecemeal."
06:04;06:07;"Like I would do the interview whenever the artist was available."
06:08;06:11;"Yeah, I mean, the early days of TC,"
06:11;06:16;"I think it was always destined to become a me and Jake talking vibe."
06:16;06:18;"I will tell you this."
06:18;06:20;"I don't know if we talked about this."
06:20;06:25;"I have a memory of in the early, early days of like hearing about podcasts."
06:25;06:28;"When did podcasts first come out, Seinfeld?"
06:28;06:31;"Oh, let me take a guess while I do that number crunch."
06:31;06:34;"If I had to guess, I would say 2009 or 10."
06:34;06:36;"This is just a shot in the dark."
06:37;06:38;"Let's start looking at that."
06:38;06:40;"Let's get Despot on the phone because I want to talk with him"
06:40;06:43;"about the early history of internet radio, podcast, time crisis,"
06:43;06:45;"things of that nature."
06:45;06:49;"This might be kind of like, it feels like a very special episode of a TV show"
06:49;06:52;"where like the actor couldn't make it."
06:52;06:54;"I don't know."
06:54;06:56;"It's like an episode of Full House where it's like,"
06:56;07:00;"""Guys, I just got a phone call. Uncle Jesse's was in a motorcycle accident."""
07:00;07:03;"Like John Stamos couldn't make it."
07:03;07:06;"And then the whole episode is just like all them like sitting together"
07:06;07:08;"and like Danny and Uncle Joey just being like,"
07:08;07:10;"""Man, I remember the first time I met him."""
07:10;07:12;"And like flashbacks and everybody's talking."
07:12;07:14;"Oh, a clip show."
07:14;07:17;"It's kind of like a clip show all just because one actor couldn't make it."
07:17;07:19;"I was way off by the way."
07:19;07:26;"Podcasting began to catch hold in late 2004 alongside the advent of the iPod."
07:26;07:28;"So, it was really the, I mean, I guess that's right."
07:28;07:30;"It's built into the name."
07:30;07:32;"So, what was the first podcast?"
07:32;07:34;"What were the early podcast hits?"
07:35;07:36;"That's a great question."
07:36;07:40;"I mean, immediately the Marc Maron comes to mind, but that was years later."
07:40;07:45;"I actually think the Ricky Gervais, Steve Merchant one would be a date."
07:45;07:50;"Oh yeah, and then they made a TV show where they would do cartoons based on the podcast."
07:51;08:16;"[Rapping]"
08:17;08:46;"[Rapping]"
08:46;08:56;"[Rapping]"
08:57;09:26;"[Rapping]"
09:26;09:34;"[Rapping]"
09:34;09:36;"Now we got Deathspun on."
09:36;09:38;"Welcome back to the program."
09:38;09:40;"Thank you. Happy to be here."
09:40;09:42;"When do you think they invented podcasts?"
09:42;09:44;"Who's they?"
09:44;09:49;"Who invented it? Probably a combination of military technology and the private corporation Apple."
09:49;09:53;"Yeah, I honestly can't think of the first time I heard of a podcast."
09:54;09:56;"I think it was the nerdiest thing ever."
09:56;10:02;"And I guess I was doing, probably doing a podcast already when podcasts were invented."
10:02;10:04;"But you were doing an internet radio show."
10:04;10:08;"Exactly. And I would never call it a podcast and I never have."
10:08;10:14;"But I think a lot of people started being like, that was how I became aware of podcasts."
10:14;10:16;"Because they were like, where can I hear your podcast?"
10:16;10:18;"And I was like, what are you talking about? I don't do that."
10:18;10:22;"And just to be clear for the listeners, you're talking about Chillin Island."
10:23;10:24;"Where did that start?"
10:24;10:33;"East Village Radio, which was a little box on First and First where people made internet radio shows, not podcast."
10:33;10:36;"And you guys would go actually go into that little box."
10:36;10:38;"Yeah."
10:38;10:49;"So that, if anybody who wasn't in New York at the time, it was kind of funny because like, whoever was DJing or doing radio, like, what do you think the square footage was?
Is that like 50 square feet?"
10:50;10:53;"No way. It's like 20."
10:53;10:55;"20 square feet. Open a door."
10:55;10:59;"It's like three people comfortably, sort of comfortably."
10:59;11:03;"Yeah. Wait, maybe that's more like a four by five room."
11:03;11:05;"Something like that."
11:05;11:10;"And so people walking by, they'd be like, staring, they could see you so clearly because you're just standing in front of a glass window."
11:10;11:13;"Yeah. You're like in a little fish tank. Yeah."
11:14;11:22;"So you started doing Chillin Island then and East Village Radio was just like streaming online. Anybody could listen to it, but they had to listen to it when it was
broadcast. Right?"
11:22;11:35;"I think they archive stuff, but I don't remember. I mean, it was definitely like, I don't know, somewhere in the beginning of internet radio, there was that other
called like pseudo that was like rap stuff."
11:35;11:38;"Wasn't it 88 hip hop or something?"
11:38;11:40;"I used to work for 88 hip hop."
11:41;11:51;"In the NY building on Houston. And my job was to get rappers to sign release forms, which is a thankless, impossible task."
11:51;12:06;"In the early 2000s, I guess, or maybe late 90s, a big thing was to go to 88 hip hop slash pseudo and steal computers, laptops. That's what we did. Because there was so many
laptops."
12:07;12:12;"Another one of Nick's jobs was to ask people not to steal laptops."
12:12;12:20;"There's a C-Raze Walls song where he actually explicitly mentions that he stole a lot of laptops from pseudo."
12:20;12:22;"Nothing wrong with that."
12:22;12:25;"I, of course, didn't steal any."
12:25;12:30;"Taking that venture capital money. There's a long history of internet radio."
12:31;12:42;"We're really standing on the shoulders of giants here at Time Crisis. But I am sad to say that, you know, I didn't realize how deep the TC family went in terms of old school
internet radio."
12:42;12:46;"But I really do think we've lost a lot of ground to podcasts in the last few years."
12:46;12:54;"Like you said, Alec, people, you do an internet radio show, you'll get many people saying, where can I hear your podcast? I listen to your podcast."
12:54;12:57;"Sometimes people might even say, I love your podcast."
12:57;12:59;"They don't understand how disrespectful they're being."
13:00;13:01;"Someone said they loved your podcast."
13:01;13:09;"Yeah, I think it was a week ago, maybe not even. I went to a party. I didn't know what the party was for."
13:09;13:13;"It was at the Jane Hotel, which is a place people don't go to anymore."
13:13;13:18;"But for some reason, people were going there. And I asked why people were going there."
13:18;13:23;"Because I sort of wanted to know why I was going to a party."
13:23;13:27;"Apparently, everyone was going there because Olivia Wilde was there."
13:28;13:31;"Which I don't know who that is, but she was there."
13:31;13:38;"And when I walked in, this guy was like, yo, aren't you the Chilling Island guy?"
13:38;13:43;"And I was like, yeah. And he was like, I love your podcast or whatever."
13:43;13:49;"And he apparently was standing with Olivia Wilde, but I didn't know who she was."
13:49;13:52;"And that's who she was there with."
13:53;13:58;"I don't know. We talked very briefly about how he likes my podcast."
13:58;14:00;"And I think I let him."
14:00;14:02;"You didn't set him straight?"
14:02;14:07;"Nah. It's like when people call me Alex. It's too much work."
14:07;14:12;"Well, that's one thing. But hold on a second, man. I don't like this."
14:12;14:18;"You had a chance to set the record straight and do something really important for the internet radio community"
14:18;14:22;"in front of celebrated actress Olivia Wilde."
14:23;14:25;"And you didn't? That could have been big for all of us."
14:25;14:30;"I mean, in fairness, I spent years telling people I don't do a podcast."
14:30;14:35;"And it gets tiring after a while. You know, podcast denial gets really tiring."
14:35;14:42;"At some point, you have to just let people call you what they want, you know, as long as you know what you are."
14:42;14:44;"I know I'm not Alex."
14:48;14:57;"You're right. It's on them. If they're going to mislabel an internet radio show or a human being, it's between you and the Lord."
14:57;14:59;"Olivia Wilde."
14:59;15:01;"You know who she is now, though, right?"
15:01;15:03;"I know what her face looks like."
15:03;15:05;"Okay."
15:05;15:10;"She's in the number one movie in the country right now. A Quiet Place Part 2."
15:10;15:12;"I don't know what that is either."
15:13;15:18;"Oh, it's a horror franchise. It's breaking records post-pandemic. You got to keep real quiet around her."
15:18;15:20;"Oh, she's in that movie?"
15:20;15:27;"Isn't she? Oh, no, I'm thinking of Emily Blunt. You know what? Just edit this part out of the show."
15:27;15:29;"No, no, no. This part's staying in."
15:29;15:31;"That's not her at all."
15:31;15:37;"I mean, that's sick. We're a whole podcast and all of us don't know who Olivia Wilde is."
15:37;15:39;"No, I know who Olivia Wilde is."
15:39;15:41;"No, you don't."
15:42;15:43;"She's in Sudeikis, right?"
15:43;15:47;"Yeah, no, she goes out with Harry Styles, I was told."
15:47;15:49;"Oh, that sounds right."
15:49;15:51;"You seem to know a lot about her."
15:51;15:54;"Well, I was at a party with her and she really likes my podcast."
15:54;15:56;"No, her friend doesn't."
15:56;15:58;"Oh, wait. You know why?"
15:58;16:04;"No, she's an actress and a director. She directed Booksmart. She acted in various films and programs."
16:04;16:06;"Are you reading her Wikipedia?"
16:06;16:08;"No, I'm not reading her Wikipedia."
16:09;16:17;"Emily Blunt and John Krasinski are kind of similar in nature to Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis in a way."
16:17;16:23;"They're sort of like parallel. I'm just trying to defend myself. I feel like it's an easy mistake to make."
16:23;16:26;"Are they similar looking? Because I don't know what the other one looks like."
16:26;16:32;"I feel like they're similar looking. Like if you boiled their features down to like Lego people."
16:32;16:36;"If you reduced them down to their basic compounds."
16:37;16:39;"You're listening to the Us Weekly podcast."
16:39;16:47;"Four guys who really love gossip, the personal lives of various actors and actresses."
16:47;16:51;"We chime in. We keep you up to date with all the tea."
16:51;16:53;"Anyway, Seinfeld."
16:53;16:57;"Is that like all white people look the same thing?"
16:57;17:02;"No, it's not like that. It's a step further. They have similar attributes."
17:02;17:04;"I see what you're saying."
17:05;17:08;"Thank you very much. I feel like I got thrown a life preserver here."
17:12;17:28;"On a summer evening and it sounds just like a song, I want more berries and that summer feeling, it's so wonderful and warm."
17:28;17:48;"Breathe me in, breathe me out, I don't know if I could ever go without, I'm just thinking out loud, I don't know if I could ever go without."
17:48;18:00;"Watermelon sugar high, watermelon sugar high, watermelon sugar high, watermelon sugar high, watermelon sugar high."
18:00;18:14;"Okay, so anyway, we will be taking periodic breaks. Our new sponsors, Us Weekly, and we'll be checking in with Seinfeld and Despot are gonna go toe to toe about who knows
more celebrity tea."
18:14;18:19;"But yes, back to the time crisis stuff. Is there a first podcast?"
18:19;18:23;"So it seems to be that the consensus is the first podcast ever."
18:23;18:25;"Was Chillin' Island."
18:25;18:26;"Chillin', that's right."
18:26;18:27;"Sounds right."
18:27;18:32;"I mean, it really sort of like set the stage for all podcasts to come as the first ever podcast."
18:32;18:42;"But alternately, there seems to be some debate because a lot of people seem to think it's a show called Open Source, hosted by Christopher Lydon, produced out of WBUR."
18:42;18:44;"And it seemed, here's how it's described."
18:44;18:54;"Christopher Lydon hosts conversations about arts, ideas, and politics that connect big thinkers and concerns of the moment, which is very much like time crisis, I
would say."
18:54;19:07;"But, you know, if you go a little further back, there's a lot of sort of like, you know, more techie conversation about like podcasts being made available via RSS feeds."
19:07;19:22;"And this is interesting and relevant. If we're going pre-iPod, the first podcast technically launched on inauguration day 2001, and the feed contained one item, a
Grateful Dead song."
19:22;19:22;"What?"
19:22;19:24;"Yeah, so..."
19:24;19:26;"Where are you reading this?"
19:26;19:28;"I'm reading this on podnews.net."
19:28;19:33;"How is that a... wait, what? Alright, what qualifies as a pod?"
19:33;19:34;"That's a good question."
19:34;19:36;"Wait, it was just a song?"
19:36;19:44;"Yeah, I mean, I think, here's what they're saying. They're saying that this was podcasting's version of Alexander Graham Bell's first telephone transmission."
19:44;19:55;"So it's not, I guess technically it's not really a podcast, but it is the first downloadable piece of kind of radio audio that was available via the internet."
19:55;20:02;"It's like in coding, when people do the ""Hello World"", it's the ""Hello World"" of podcasts."
20:02;20:03;"There you go."
20:03;20:09;"It's just like, it's making the thing happen, but it's not even really a fully fleshed out version of the thing."
20:09;20:14;"Wait, hold on. You're gonna have to explain that to me. What does ""Hello World"" mean in terms of coding?"
20:14;20:28;"When you're like debugging or like testing like a program or a script, you'll make it print ""Hello World"" and that's like, okay, the script works because it wrote out
""Hello World"" or it..."
20:28;20:29;"You know, whatever."
20:29;20:31;"So that's a tradition?"
20:31;20:32;"I think so."
20:32;20:41;"Like the same way with a microphone, people say ""testing, testing, one, two, three"". It's a tradition to write ""Hello World"" when you're fixing a script in coding."
20:41;20:50;"Yeah. I mean, I used to do it because like the book would tell you to do that when you learn a programming language."
20:50;20:50;"""Hello World""."
20:50;20:52;"Wikipedia agrees."
20:52;20:53;"What?"
20:53;20:56;"Wikipedia confirms that's right."
20:56;20:58;"Oh, cool. I'm a genius."
20:58;21:02;"I think a podcast just means that it's downloadable."
21:02;21:10;"Because a podcast in the early days was a specific type of feed and had a specific tech thing."
21:10;21:18;"They were basically the first thing that went down those, the podcast tubes was a Grateful Dead song. That was their version of ""Hello World""."
21:18;21:20;"Yeah. Are you guys familiar with the..."
21:20;21:21;"What song was it? ""Eyes of the World""?"
21:21;21:23;"It was US blues."
21:23;21:25;"Okay."
21:25;21:31;"Just to sort of back this up a little bit, are you guys familiar with the MTV VJ Adam Curry?"
21:31;21:34;"Yeah. I think he was like an 80s guy, right?"
21:34;21:36;"It sounds really familiar."
21:36;21:46;"He was a VJ for seven years on MTV. From what I could tell, he conceptualized this idea of what was called audio blogging, but needed a way to test it out."
21:46;21:53;"So he like uploaded this Grateful Dead song. I'm doing like a very like reductive simplification."
21:53;21:55;"And that happened in 2001?"
21:55;21:57;"Yeah, that was launched 2001."
21:57;22:03;"Well, this is a pretty major breakthrough. Make a note. Let's tell Jake about this in two weeks."
22:05;22:07;"Red and white"
22:07;22:09;"Blue suede shoes"
22:09;22:13;"I'm Uncle Sam"
22:13;22:15;"How do you do?"
22:15;22:19;"Give me five"
22:19;22:23;"I'm still alive"
22:23;22:25;"Ain't no luck"
22:25;22:29;"I learned to duck"
22:33;22:35;"Check my pulse"
22:35;22:39;"It don't change"
22:39;22:41;"Stay 72"
22:41;22:45;"Come shine or rain"
22:45;22:49;"Wave the flag"
22:49;22:51;"Pop the bag"
22:51;22:55;"Rock the boat"
22:55;22:59;"Skin the goat"
22:59;23:01;"Wave that flag"
23:01;23:03;"Wave it wide"
23:03;23:19;"That's some really good tea. Thank you, Seinfeld. And I hope all our new Us Weekly listeners enjoy this celebrity tea."
23:19;23:25;"Wait, our tea was just that Emily Blunt is in the movie A Quiet Place?"
23:25;23:29;"We have two major bombshells. One is that Emily Blunt and Olivia Wilde are two different people."
23:29;23:37;"And our second one is that the first podcast was a Grateful Dead song."
23:37;23:39;"Yeah, that is pretty hot tea."
23:39;23:41;"That's actually like insane that we've never come across that before."
23:41;23:45;"And that Olivia Wilde is a big Chilling Island fan."
23:45;23:47;"And that Olivia Wilde is a big Chilling Island fan."
23:47;23:49;"She listens to internet radio."
23:49;23:51;"To this day."
23:51;23:53;"Maybe Harry Styles put her onto it."
23:53;23:55;"I love that that's this fact."
23:55;23:57;"On the one hand, it's such an amazing fact."
23:57;23:59;"It's almost like made for time crisis."
23:59;24:01;"The first podcast was a Grateful Dead song."
24:01;24:09;"And yet, it's so conceptually difficult that there's almost nobody you could tell it to."
24:09;24:15;"You could be like making small talk at a party with Olivia Wilde, Emily Blunt, people of that nature."
24:15;24:17;"And say, ""Hey, you want to hear something interesting?"
24:17;24:21;"Did you know that the first podcast was a Grateful Dead song?"""
24:21;24:23;"And everybody would just get kind of annoyed."
24:23;24:27;"They'd be like, ""What the f*ck does that mean?"""
24:27;24:29;"And you'd be like, ""Well, Adam Curry."
24:29;24:31;"The VJ Adam Curry."""
24:31;24:33;"Also, this feels..."
24:33;24:35;"Even if you were talking to a huge deadhead,"
24:35;24:37;"you like wounded up to a party,"
24:37;24:39;"and you're standing around with a bunch of hippies,"
24:39;24:41;"and everybody's talking about the Grateful Dead,"
24:41;24:43;"and be like, ""Oh guys, I love the Grateful Dead."
24:43;24:45;"Did you know that the first podcast was a Grateful Dead song?"""
24:45;24:49;"And they'd be like, ""Man, what the f*ck are you talking about?"""
24:49;24:53;"That tea is almost so hot that it's beyond the human mind."
24:53;24:55;"Yeah, it's screaming hot."
24:55;24:59;"You've got to understand too that I had a wall,"
24:59;25:01;"a 2,000 word block of text in front of me."
25:01;25:03;"So I agree with you."
25:03;25:05;"I think to tell that story properly,"
25:05;25:09;"you'd have to almost boil it down to its essence,"
25:09;25:11;"and find a way to simplify it."
25:11;25:13;"Yeah, I agree."
25:13;25:15;"It's hard to wrap your mind around."
25:15;25:17;"I'm even thinking..."
25:17;25:19;"You want to hear about my new party talk?"
25:19;25:21;"That's really like that."
25:21;25:23;"Yeah."
25:23;25:25;"Alright, I don't know anything about this,"
25:25;25:27;"so it's the same idea."
25:27;25:29;"But I just found out about it two days ago."
25:29;25:31;"Oh, I can't wait."
25:31;25:35;"And I mostly just know what my friend told me about it,"
25:35;25:37;"and then I read Wikipedia,"
25:37;25:39;"and then there's not much else up there."
25:39;25:41;"Okay, so there's this guy,"
25:41;25:43;"this Russian philosopher,"
25:43;25:45;"his name is Fyodorov."
25:45;25:47;"You know about him?"
25:47;25:49;"Sounds familiar."
25:49;25:51;"He has this idea."
25:51;25:53;"He wants to solve death."
25:53;25:55;"Well, he's dead."
25:55;25:57;"But he wanted to solve death."
25:57;25:59;"That's a big L."
25:59;26:03;"And part of the thing I really like about it is,"
26:03;26:05;"the overarching principle is that"
26:05;26:09;"he will obviously achieve immortality by solving death."
26:09;26:11;"However, he's going to do that."
26:11;26:15;"But the big thing that he has to do,"
26:15;26:17;"which is,"
26:17;26:19;"the big thing he has to do is"
26:19;26:23;"resurrect every single person who ever died."
26:23;26:25;"And the reasoning is,"
26:25;26:27;"it's not fair that we all get to live forever"
26:27;26:29;"because he solved death,"
26:29;26:31;"but all the people who died have to be dead."
26:31;26:33;"So he wants them all to come back."
26:33;26:35;"And obviously you say,"
26:35;26:39;"""Okay, we can't even all fit on the planet."""
26:39;26:41;"But he has an answer for that."
26:41;26:43;"Of course, the answer is,"
26:43;26:45;"""We will colonize all the stars."""
26:45;26:47;"And that's where we'll live."
26:47;26:49;"That's the long and short of it."
26:49;26:51;"But when I was a kid,"
26:51;26:53;"I used to think about that."
26:53;26:55;"I used to be like, ""I want to live forever."""
26:55;26:57;"But I was like, ""Also, it's not fair if I live forever."""
26:57;26:59;"So everyone has to live forever."
26:59;27:01;"That crossed your mind as a child?"
27:01;27:07;"Yeah, so I'm really surprised that it wasn't an original idea."
27:07;27:09;"I like this guy."
27:09;27:11;"You're a pretty ethical child."
27:11;27:13;"This is what I talk about at parties,"
27:13;27:15;"but I don't know anything about her."
27:15;27:17;"Did you bring it up with Olivia Wilde?"
27:17;27:19;"No, I didn't have a chance."
27:19;27:21;"We were mostly just talking about Jill and I."
27:21;27:23;"That reminds me of Ray Kurzweil,"
27:23;27:25;"the futurist who works at Google"
27:25;27:27;"who believes that in 2045,"
27:27;27:29;"we will all as a species achieve immortality"
27:29;27:31;"because you'll be able to download your consciousness."
27:31;27:33;"The singularity."
27:35;27:37;"Yeah, same idea."
27:37;27:39;"But obviously,"
27:39;27:41;"Fyodorov had less to work with."
27:41;27:45;"There's no such thing as downloading."
27:45;27:47;"He was probably more like,"
27:47;27:49;"you could harvest your toe."
27:49;27:51;"I don't know what his ideas were."
27:51;27:53;"Probably harvesting your toe."
27:53;27:55;"Toe harvesting."
27:55;27:57;"Well, but I guess neither you nor Fyodorov"
27:57;27:59;"nor Ray Kurzweil"
27:59;28:01;"believe in reincarnation."
28:01;28:03;"Or is that incompatible?"
28:03;28:05;"I don't know."
28:05;28:07;"Hard to say because maybe"
28:07;28:09;"that's how you resurrect all the dead people."
28:09;28:11;"You locate the bird"
28:11;28:13;"that they are now."
28:13;28:15;"And you turn it back"
28:15;28:17;"into a person using magic."
28:17;28:19;"I don't know."
28:19;28:21;"I don't know how the people who believe in reincarnation"
28:21;28:23;"account for the fact that there's"
28:23;28:25;"more people now"
28:25;28:27;"than there were back in the day."
28:27;28:29;"Maybe that's not that hard to explain."
28:29;28:31;"If you can download your consciousness"
28:31;28:33;"into a microchip or whatever."
28:33;28:35;"Maybe you can do that with all creatures."
28:35;28:37;"And then you can just change the file extension"
28:37;28:39;"at the end so that everything"
28:39;28:41;"just kind of reconverts to the same."
28:41;28:43;"It could be .dog, .bird, .human."
28:43;28:45;"Exactly."
28:45;28:47;"Change .dog to .human."
28:47;28:49;"I think we've got a lot of great advice so far"
28:49;28:51;"on this show. If we've got any listeners who are shy."
28:51;28:53;"Maybe people are going to parties"
28:53;28:55;"for the first time in over a year."
28:55;28:57;"They've got social anxiety."
28:57;28:59;"I haven't been around people in a long time."
28:59;29:01;"I don't remember how to talk."
29:01;29:03;"Especially how do you be charming?"
29:03;29:05;"How do you keep somebody's attention?"
29:05;29:07;"So here's the thing. You start off with"
29:07;29:09;"Fyodorov's concept"
29:09;29:11;"of the ethics of"
29:11;29:13;"solving death."
29:13;29:15;"And obviously that's a great way to say it."
29:15;29:17;"Say you're with Olivia."
29:17;29:19;"""Olivia, do you think it'd be fair"
29:19;29:21;"if we could all live forever but then"
29:21;29:23;"all the people who had died are no longer with us?"""
29:23;29:25;"And see what they say and go."
29:25;29:27;"Now, if it gets weird"
29:27;29:29;"because there's reasons why"
29:29;29:31;"what if that person"
29:31;29:33;"says, ""I don't like this conversation."
29:33;29:35;"You're playing God."" Stuff like that."
29:35;29:37;"That could happen. Then, in your mind,"
29:37;29:39;"you've got to have that voice in your head"
29:39;29:41;"say, ""Bail, bail, bail."""
29:41;29:43;"And then you just hard change the subject."
29:43;29:45;"""Did you know the first"
29:45;29:47;"podcast was a Grateful Dead song?"""
29:47;29:49;"And then you're golden."
29:49;29:51;"So that's the Time Crisis"
29:51;29:53;"X Chillin' Island"
29:53;29:55;"two-step party trick"
29:55;29:57;"to reintroducing yourself to society."
29:57;29:59;"It cannot go wrong."
29:59;30:01;"How to make everyone like you"
30:01;30:03;"in two easy steps."
30:03;30:07;"And honestly, if they're not with you"
30:07;30:09;"after you do the hard bail to the"
30:09;30:11;"first podcast being a Grateful Dead song,"
30:11;30:13;"f*ck 'em."
30:13;30:15;"They're not worth your time."
30:15;30:17;"Move on to Emily Blunt."
30:17;30:19;"Yeah, who will"
30:19;30:21;"definitely be right next to Olivia Wilde."
30:21;30:23;"Absolutely."

31:15;31:17;"I think that's, yeah,"
31:17;31:19;"in a parallel universe that exists in the same"
31:19;31:21;"dimension."
31:21;31:23;"I think you're onto something."
31:23;31:25;"Yeah, I think because"
31:25;31:27;"of all, you know, with all this technology"
31:27;31:29;"and all these new emerging ideas,"
31:29;31:31;"maybe reincarnation has"
31:31;31:33;"changed. You know, the parameters"
31:33;31:35;"of reincarnation are different now."
31:35;31:37;"Like maybe Ezra is the"
31:37;31:39;"reincarnation of me."
31:39;31:41;"Right, maybe time got flattened."
31:41;31:43;"It doesn't have to be some linear"
31:43;31:45;"time thing. One person dies."
31:45;31:47;"I thought I was the reincarnation of"
31:47;31:49;"Philip K. Dick when I was like in junior"
31:49;31:51;"high because he died the year"
31:51;31:53;"I was born and I liked him a lot"
31:53;31:55;"and that was all I needed. That seems"
31:55;31:57;"decent. Decent evidence."
31:57;31:59;"I think so. When somebody"
31:59;32:01;"tried to do a past life regression"
32:01;32:03;"on me when I was like"
32:03;32:05;"11 or 12"
32:05;32:07;"and I threw up."
32:07;32:09;"I don't know what that means. Wait, hold"
32:09;32:11;"on, hold on a second. Pump the brakes"
32:11;32:13;"for a second here. Let's back this up."
32:13;32:15;"Somebody tried to do a past life"
32:15;32:17;"regression on you? Yeah."
32:17;32:19;"Was it a friend? What's the context"
32:19;32:21;"on that? They make"
32:21;32:23;"you be the guy you were"
32:23;32:25;"before or whatever, the cat or dog"
32:25;32:27;"you were before. I think they help you tap into your"
32:27;32:29;"past life. This was"
32:29;32:31;"my grandma's friend and I guess"
32:31;32:33;"she was into past life. Actually, yeah"
32:33;32:35;"as I'm saying it out loud, this was a very"
32:35;32:37;"unusual event. I think"
32:37;32:39;"I was too young."
32:39;32:41;"I think I already went in, probably"
32:41;32:43;"similar to you Alec, where I already"
32:43;32:45;"had some sh*t on my mind."
32:45;32:47;"I don't think I went in totally"
32:47;32:49;"blank slate style."
32:49;32:51;"I feel like she was"
32:51;32:53;"I don't think she hypnotized"
32:53;32:55;"me. She was just"
32:55;32:57;"like, I feel like I was laying on"
32:57;32:59;"a couch in upstate"
32:59;33:01;"New York and she was just talking to me"
33:01;33:03;"and I think I'd eaten a lot of cookies or"
33:03;33:05;"something, which is why I threw up. Or maybe"
33:05;33:07;"it was like my body couldn't"
33:07;33:09;"handle the g-force of"
33:09;33:11;"my past life regression."
33:11;33:13;"But I just remember feeling like"
33:13;33:15;"I think I started to develop"
33:15;33:17;"this image in my mind"
33:17;33:19;"that I was like one of the crew"
33:19;33:21;"of guys who killed Caesar. Not"
33:21;33:23;"necessarily Brutus, but one"
33:23;33:25;"of the guys. But then I was like"
33:25;33:27;"I think at the time I"
33:27;33:29;"knew that, I bet I had just"
33:29;33:31;"read about that. You know,"
33:31;33:33;"like that was a moment in history and I knew it."
33:33;33:35;"So, I don't think I was"
33:35;33:37;"regressing in good faith."
33:37;33:39;"I think I probably was thinking about"
33:39;33:41;"oh, like ancient Rome"
33:41;33:43;"and togas and"
33:43;33:45;"et tu Brute?"
33:45;33:47;"And all that stuff. I would love to do a past"
33:47;33:49;"life regression now that I think I could probably"
33:49;33:51;"go in a little more seriously."
33:51;33:53;"But, um, and then it got cut short because I"
33:53;33:55;"threw up. Right. But they"
33:55;33:57;"always, I mean like, you know, people always say"
33:57;33:59;"like how come when you're being told"
33:59;34:01;"what your past lives were they're never like"
34:01;34:03;"oh, you were a snail or you were"
34:03;34:05;"like a janitor or whatever. Right."
34:05;34:07;"You were always something great."
34:07;34:09;"I have a audio"
34:09;34:11;"cassette tape of my"
34:11;34:13;"parents friend who was like a"
34:13;34:15;"whatever, like psychic"
34:15;34:17;"guy. He did my birth chart"
34:17;34:19;"when I was born and then he recorded"
34:19;34:21;"this 90 minute tape going"
34:21;34:23;"through like what my life was going to be"
34:23;34:25;"and what all my other lives were."
34:25;34:27;"And it was like"
34:27;34:29;"I was a samurai"
34:29;34:31;"and a renaissance painter and like"
34:31;34:33;"a **** like that. And of course"
34:33;34:35;"I listened to it and I was like yeah."
34:35;34:37;"I mean, of course"
34:37;34:39;"I was those things."
34:39;34:41;"You have the creativity of a renaissance painter,"
34:41;34:43;"the honor of a samurai."
34:43;34:45;"Yeah, and then there was some other good ones"
34:45;34:47;"but I don't remember."
34:47;34:49;"But yeah, I still have all those things"
34:49;34:51;"so it makes perfect sense. You should listen"
34:51;34:53;"and see how your life matches up"
34:53;34:55;"because there were also predictions."
34:55;34:57;"Yeah, I did listen when I was like"
34:57;34:59;"19, 20 and it was"
34:59;35:01;"like, I mean, but you know"
35:01;35:03;"they speak in these vague"
35:03;35:05;"terms so you're like yeah."
35:05;35:07;"That's kind of what happened"
35:07;35:09;"but it's not really what happened."
35:09;35:11;"It's like those mediums who are like"
35:11;35:13;"oh I'm thinking of somebody, their name has"
35:13;35:15;"an E or an A in it and you're like"
35:15;35:17;"oh yeah, that's like"
35:17;35:19;"that's the person. Yeah,"
35:19;35:21;"it's definitely that person."
35:21;35:23;"He said I see you doing something"
35:23;35:25;"I don't know what these words"
35:25;35:27;"mean, it's a podcast"
35:27;35:29;"and you're just like this guy's full of **** man."
35:29;35:31;"An internet radio show."
35:31;35:33;"Dumbass."
35:33;35:37;"An internet radio show"
35:37;35:39;"the acronym for that would be IRS."
35:39;35:41;"Have you talked about that?"
35:41;35:43;"Whoa, that's actually never come up."
35:43;35:45;"Maybe we should collaborate"
35:45;35:47;"Time Crisis, Chilling Island,"
35:47;35:49;"Sudow"
35:49;35:51;"and print out some IRS gear."
35:51;35:53;"Yeah, just take the"
35:53;35:55;"IRS logo. Yeah, they probably have"
35:55;35:57;"so many good... Yeah, they have probably a whole"
35:57;35:59;"graphic design world. Yeah,"
35:59;36:01;"they do and it's a scary thing"
36:01;36:03;"to see on a piece of mail."
36:03;36:05;"So, it's probably even scarier to see"
36:05;36:07;"on a dad hat. Or also"
36:07;36:09;"we actually just start mailing"
36:09;36:11;"we start sending mail to"
36:11;36:13;"prominent podcasters. Right,"
36:13;36:15;"just mail like this week on Time"
36:15;36:17;"Crisis and it's an IRS logo."
36:17;36:19;"This is an official IRS..."
36:19;36:21;"I don't even know, what are famous"
36:21;36:23;"podcasts? Call Her Daddy."
36:23;36:25;"I just..."
36:25;36:27;"I don't know what that is. That's a major"
36:27;36:29;"podcast. Okay."
36:29;36:31;"This is an official IRS statement."
36:31;36:33;"Internet radio show is a valid"
36:33;36:35;"form of self-expression."
36:35;36:37;"Just because you're on a popular podcast"
36:37;36:39;"does not mean..."
36:39;36:41;"And if you're on a podcast, it doesn't mean you're"
36:41;36:43;"not on an IRS as well."
36:43;36:45;"They overlap. Interesting, true."
36:45;36:47;"You can't call an IRS"
36:47;36:49;"a podcast maybe. I'm making"
36:49;36:51;"a prediction right now. I think by the year"
36:51;36:53;"2045, podcasts and"
36:53;36:55;"internet radio show will be one thing."
36:55;36:57;"You have a lot of work to do"
36:57;36:59;"to get there, I think. It's mostly"
36:59;37:01;"back-end work. It's going to be..."
37:01;37:03;"It's going to involve a lot of coding."
37:03;37:05;"Yeah, just changing file extension from"
37:05;37:07;".podcast to .IRS."
37:07;37:09;".IRS."
37:09;37:11;"Have you guys been getting those"
37:11;37:13;"scam calls from people"
37:13;37:15;"who claim to be from the IRS"
37:15;37:17;"and it's like... or like... I mean there's"
37:17;37:19;"a car warranty one as well, but like"
37:19;37:21;"the scary one is like, ""The federal"
37:21;37:23;"government would like to reach you. Attention"
37:23;37:25;"is required immediately."" Do you know those?"
37:25;37:27;"I have heard those."
37:27;37:29;"Yeah, it says you owe..."
37:29;37:31;"It'll say an amount if you listen"
37:31;37:33;"long enough. It's like you owe us"
37:33;37:35;"$6,000 or whatever."
37:35;37:37;"Pay it right now. Oh, we should start doing"
37:37;37:39;"those. I always just pay it."
37:39;37:41;"[laughter]"
37:41;37:43;"Say, ""F*** it."""
37:43;37:45;"Better safe than sorry. What about the"
37:45;37:47;"car warranty ones? When you get those"
37:47;37:49;"calls, do you stay on? Because I always stay on"
37:49;37:51;"and I mess with them until they hang up on me."
37:51;37:53;"I had one today that was actually"
37:53;37:55;"weird, because it"
37:55;37:57;"was real. Oh, what was it? Oh."
37:57;37:59;"I got a call from an 888"
37:59;38:01;"number, and I do pick them"
38:01;38:03;"up because every so often"
38:03;38:05;"it's like it actually is something."
38:05;38:07;"Usually if it's like, ""We're"
38:07;38:09;"going to talk about your car's warranty,"""
38:09;38:11;"I hang up, but sometimes"
38:11;38:13;"I listen a little. But this"
38:13;38:15;"one was like, ""Hello,"
38:15;38:17;"is this..."" and it was my dad's"
38:17;38:19;"name. My dad passed away in January."
38:19;38:21;"It gives you"
38:21;38:23;"a second to respond, and I was like,"
38:23;38:25;"""No."""
38:25;38:27;"Then some lady"
38:27;38:29;"got on, and she was like, ""Well,"
38:29;38:31;"do I have the wrong number?"" I was like,"
38:31;38:33;"""You were a robot a second ago,"
38:33;38:35;"and now you're just jumping in like that."
38:35;38:37;"That's not fair. It's shocking."""
38:37;38:39;"Then she was"
38:39;38:41;"like, ""Well, do you have a"
38:41;38:43;"student loan out?"" I was like, ""No."""
38:43;38:45;"""Oh, I said I was his son."""
38:45;38:47;"They're like, ""You have a student loan?"" I was like,"
38:47;38:49;"""No."" They're like, ""Does anyone"
38:49;38:51;"in your family?"" I was like, ""Yeah, my brother."""
38:51;38:53;"Then it was cool"
38:53;38:55;"because I won."
38:55;38:57;"I just kind of cut her"
38:57;38:59;"off because she was about to be like, ""Your"
38:59;39:01;"loan is in default,"" which I knew it was."
39:01;39:03;"My brother's student loan is currently in default."
39:03;39:05;"I cut her off, and I was like,"
39:05;39:07;"""Yeah, well, guess what? My father"
39:07;39:09;"died in January. The loan is in"
39:09;39:11;"his name."" She was like,"
39:11;39:13;"""Oh."" I was like, ""Yeah,"
39:13;39:15;"and federal loans are forgiven"
39:15;39:17;"if the holder of the loan"
39:17;39:19;"dies, so I guess the loan is forgiven."""
39:19;39:21;"She was like, ""Yeah,"
39:21;39:23;"it is."""
39:23;39:25;"- Oh, man. Did she offer sympathy"
39:25;39:27;"and condolences? - No, not at all."
39:27;39:29;"- Really? - No. She was like,"
39:29;39:31;"""Okay. Well, they are"
39:31;39:33;"forgiven."" I think"
39:33;39:35;"they know, but they could probably still"
39:35;39:37;"scare you into pain a little bit"
39:37;39:39;"or whatever. - So you"
39:39;39:41;"did a full goodwill hunting"
39:41;39:43;"on her. - I did, yeah. Exactly."
39:43;39:45;"But no condolences were offered."
39:45;39:47;"Then she was just like, ""Okay, you got a copy of the"
39:47;39:49;"death certificate. Mail it to this address."""
39:49;39:51;"She was like, ""All right, whatever."""
39:51;39:53;"- Oh, yeah, definitely."
39:53;39:55;"I'm gonna get right on that."
39:55;39:57;"- I mean,"
39:57;39:59;"I am. - Oh, because you actually"
39:59;40:01;"will be helping"
40:01;40:03;"your brother by doing that?"
40:03;40:05;"- I don't know how that works. If you just ignore"
40:05;40:07;"it, I mean, maybe not. Maybe it doesn't"
40:07;40:09;"matter, but..."
40:09;40:11;"The point is I won."
40:11;40:13;"- Yeah, you won."
40:13;40:15;"Despot won. Hey, I got"
40:15;40:17;"one of those student loan forgiveness ones"
40:17;40:19;"a couple years ago. I'll never forget it. It was"
40:19;40:21;"a scam. It wasn't real."
40:21;40:23;"Sometimes when that happens, I try to seem"
40:23;40:25;"really extremely pathetic."
40:25;40:27;"They were like, ""Oh, you know,"
40:27;40:29;"student loan forgiveness, whatever."" I was like,"
40:29;40:31;"""Oh."" I showed all this"
40:31;40:33;"gratitude. They were like, ""How much debt"
40:33;40:35;"are you in?"" I said, ""A million"
40:35;40:37;"dollars."" Without missing a beat,"
40:37;40:39;"the lady on the phone said, ""F*** yourself"
40:39;40:41;"a million times."" - Whoa!"
40:41;40:43;"- Yeah, it was"
40:43;40:45;"like... It was pretty amazing."
40:45;40:47;"- Wait. - She could've been nicer. She"
40:47;40:49;"could've been like, ""Where'd you go to college?"""
40:49;40:51;"It must've been very nice."
40:51;40:53;"- I think something in my voice. I think"
40:53;40:55;"I was a little too theatrical."
40:55;40:57;"- Oh, you broke character? - I think so."
40:57;40:59;"I think she'd picked it up immediately"
40:59;41:01;"having, you know, probably done the..."
41:01;41:03;"- Could've got her fired, I'm sure."
41:03;41:05;"- Well, the thing is when you try to call"
41:05;41:07;"those numbers back, it doesn't go"
41:07;41:09;"anywhere. - But it's still recorded"
41:09;41:11;"for quality assurance. - That is true."
41:11;41:13;"It is always recorded for quality assurance."
41:13;41:15;"- So, you probably"
41:15;41:17;"could've got in touch with the company and been like,"
41:17;41:19;"""You should check your quality assurance records."""
41:19;41:21;"- That was low. - I had low quality"
41:21;41:23;"interaction. - Very low quality."
41:23;41:25;"Yeah. - Also, it's"
41:25;41:27;"just a ridiculous thing to say."
41:27;41:29;"How can you f*** yourself a million times?"
41:29;41:31;"It's hyperbole."
41:31;41:33;"It's just like unreal. It's just..."
41:33;41:35;"It's mean. Obviously, it's only meant to"
41:35;41:37;"be very mean. - Yeah, I mean..."
41:37;41:39;"- You could've just said, ""Go f*** yourself,"" once."
41:39;41:41;"- Well, I think the incorporation of"
41:41;41:43;"my... You know, I think"
41:43;41:45;"she had it in her back pocket. She's obviously heard"
41:45;41:47;"it all, and so there was a certain"
41:47;41:49;"parallel that she was ready for. She was ready"
41:49;41:51;"for that comeback. - Maybe that's her script."
41:51;41:53;"Her script is just, ""Go f*** yourself,"""
41:53;41:55;"and whatever amount the person says, she's"
41:55;41:57;"like, ""Yeah, well, f*** yourself"
41:57;41:59;"15,326"
41:59;42:01;"and 49 cents times."""
42:01;42:03;"[laughter]"
42:05;42:07;"They're just pranking people."
42:07;42:09;"- Yeah, pretty much."
42:09;42:11;"That's kinda cool, if you look at it that way."
42:11;42:13;"If you're this big financial"
42:13;42:15;"institution, and all these people owe you"
42:15;42:17;"money, and you just hire a bunch of trolls"
42:17;42:19;"to prank everyone, that's pretty sick."
42:21;42:26;"Up inside, hang your dollar on me."
42:26;42:30;"Listen to the water still."
42:30;42:34;"Listen to the causeway."
42:34;42:38;"You're all mad and educated."
42:38;42:42;"Primitive and wild."
42:42;42:46;"Welcome to the occupation."
42:46;42:50;"Here, we stand and here we fight."
42:50;42:54;"All you fallen heroes."
42:54;42:58;"Held and died and skinned alive."
42:58;43:01;"Listen to the Congress fire."
43:01;43:05;"Humoring the educated."
43:05;43:09;"Primitive and loyal."
43:09;43:13;"Welcome to the occupation."
43:13;43:17;"Hang your collar up inside."
43:17;43:21;"Hang your freedom higher."
43:21;43:25;"Listen to the fire still."
43:25;43:32;"Listen to the Congress where we propagate confusion."
43:32;43:36;"Primitive and wild."
43:36;43:40;"Fire on the hemisphere."
43:40;43:43;"All this talk about over the past five years"
43:43;43:47;"about Russian bots and interference"
43:47;43:49;"in our democracy and social media."
43:49;43:53;"That'd be tight if they just started."
43:53;43:55;"What would really demoralize America"
43:55;43:57;"is actual prank phone calls."
43:57;43:59;"Then you'd really get people."
43:59;44:02;"And you have a lot of people ready to do that job who"
44:02;44:05;"maybe don't have jobs right now."
44:05;44:07;"You'd say, look, you get, I don't know,"
44:07;44:10;"1,000 bucks a week to make X amount of prank calls"
44:10;44:12;"to these people who owe us money."
44:12;44:14;"Actually, that kind of sounds like--"
44:14;44:16;"I think if you did it really dryly,"
44:16;44:21;"it almost sounds like a art film that they--"
44:21;44:23;"it could be part of an exhibition at the Whitney"
44:23;44:27;"Biennial or the Venice Biennale, where it's like,"
44:27;44:32;"imagine if we made this really kind of dry art film."
44:32;44:34;"It also sounds like one of those things where"
44:34;44:36;"you get some government grant for--"
44:36;44:39;"or some corporate grant for $5 million."
44:39;44:42;"And then we go to a call center in India."
44:42;44:44;"And we give people the top dollar,"
44:44;44:47;"whatever the best call center pays,"
44:47;44:49;"and then hire a few hundred people"
44:49;44:53;"to just prank call Americans for a month."
44:53;44:59;"But then you kind of film it in that kind of art film style."
44:59;45:01;"And then you just kind of watch it, really long takes."
45:01;45:03;"And I don't know what the [BLEEP]"
45:03;45:06;"it's a commentary on something."
45:06;45:08;"Capitalism, globalization."
45:08;45:09;"Long--"
45:09;45:10;"Commentary on him knows."
45:10;45:16;"Like, long Jerky Boys style, or just sort of Bart Simpson,"
45:16;45:18;"Seymour Butts, just in and out."
45:18;45:21;"But it's like a Jerky Boys boiler room."
45:21;45:24;"There's hundreds, thousands of them."
45:24;45:26;"And they're all Jerky Boys."
45:26;45:29;"Jerky Boys boiler room."
45:29;45:33;"Thousands."
45:33;45:35;"And I mean, some of them could be old school, just like,"
45:35;45:38;"hello, is your refrigerator running?"
45:38;45:40;"Well, you better go and catch it."
45:40;45:41;"And then just like, onto the next one."
45:41;45:42;"That's entry level."
45:42;45:44;"That's like the low--"
45:44;45:44;"Right."
45:44;45:46;"--the junior accounts, or whatever,"
45:46;45:49;"they get the refrigerator one."
45:49;45:51;"Yeah, just like hundreds of people."
45:51;45:52;"Yeah, and little cubicles."
45:52;45:55;"I have a good prank call thing."
45:55;45:59;"When I was a little kid, I was like nine or something."
45:59;46:02;"There was a pool behind my apartment building."
46:02;46:06;"So like, people used to go to the pool when I was nine."
46:06;46:09;"And there was a payphone, like, you know,"
46:09;46:12;"that you could-- when people still used payphones."
46:12;46:15;"There was a payphone at the pool so you can make phone calls,"
46:15;46:17;"because you didn't have a phone in your pocket."
46:17;46:21;"There was a helpline on every box of tampons,"
46:21;46:22;"Tampax tampons."
46:22;46:24;"And it was 1-800-TAMPON."
46:24;46:29;"And you could call 800 numbers for free from a payphone."
46:29;46:33;"So when I was like nine, my go-to prank call"
46:33;46:35;"was to call 1-800-TAMPON."
46:35;46:39;"And pretend I was a girl having a problem with a tampon."
46:39;46:40;"But I was--"
46:40;46:44;"I knew very little about tampons or anything like that,"
46:44;46:46;"because I was nine years old."
46:46;46:50;"So I'd call and be like--"
46:50;46:55;"pretend I'm crying and be like, I can't get it out or whatever."
46:55;46:57;"And they'd be like, OK, well, that happened."
46:57;46:59;"It's like, you know, you should try this."
46:59;47:00;"And they really, like, talk you through it."
47:00;47:03;"And so, you know, obviously, I'd throw in, like,"
47:03;47:06;"some gross, like, perverted thing."
47:06;47:07;"And it wouldn't make any sense."
47:07;47:09;"And then they'd figure it out."
47:09;47:12;"But that was a really reliable, you know--"
47:12;47:15;"do that on speakerphone with a bunch of nine and eight-year-olds."
47:15;47:16;"And you could really--"
47:16;47:18;"Everybody was just dying."
47:18;47:21;"What I like about you doing it from the payphone"
47:21;47:22;"is that, you know, that's really--"
47:22;47:25;"without a speakerphone or recording device,"
47:25;47:26;"that's just for the love of the game."
47:26;47:27;"It was just for me."
47:27;47:28;"For you."
47:28;47:29;"Yeah, it's great."
47:29;47:31;"It was for me."
47:31;47:35;"Yeah, I have very vivid memories being, like, soaking wet."
47:35;47:40;"Because I just ran out of the pool to, like, go call 1-800-TAMPONS again."
47:40;47:43;"Because, like, I, you know, I really just had to do it."
47:43;47:46;"Just a beautiful summer day in Queens."
47:46;47:48;"People splashing and enjoying themselves."
47:48;47:51;"And you're calling 1-800-TAMPONS."
47:51;47:54;"You might bring, like, a couple of friends to the payphone,"
47:54;47:55;"pass it around."
47:55;47:59;"Each one takes a turn with that 1-800-TAMPONS."
47:59;48:00;"I wonder if that still exists."
48:00;48:02;"Almost definitely."
48:02;48:03;"They wouldn't give up that number."
48:03;48:06;"That's a great phone number to have."
48:06;48:08;"Yeah, seven digits."
48:08;48:09;"T-A-M-P-O-N-S."
48:09;48:12;"Seinfeld, can we get a number crunch?"
48:12;48:14;"And by the way, anybody who's listening at home,"
48:14;48:17;"unless you're nine years old, we do not advocate"
48:17;48:19;"prank calling 1-800-TAMPONS."
48:19;48:22;"But it could be a good resource if you need any info."
48:22;48:27;"Yeah, it appears to still exist."
48:27;48:31;"Also, the first result when you Google 1-800-TAMPONS"
48:31;48:33;"is that somebody named Matthew Farzam"
48:33;48:37;"has trademarked 1-800-TAMPONS."
48:37;48:41;"And there's a lot of information about everything"
48:41;48:43;"to do with the trademark, the serial number."
48:43;48:46;"I assume that's different from the phone number."
48:46;48:49;"This is just like a--"
48:49;48:50;"this is just a branding."
48:50;48:51;"Clothing line."
48:51;48:52;"Oh, yeah, it's probably streetwear."
48:52;48:53;"It's like 1-800-TAMPONS."
48:53;48:54;"Streetwear, yeah."
48:54;48:55;"Shirt."
48:55;48:57;"Supreme Palace, 1-800-TAMPONS."
48:57;48:59;"Tampons, yeah."
48:59;49:00;"Dad hats."
49:00;49:02;"Socks, whatever."
49:02;49:04;"Tube socks."
49:04;49:04;"Yeah."
49:04;49:05;"That would be sick."
49:05;49:07;"It's not operational."
49:07;49:07;"Really?"
49:07;49:09;"Is it not working?"
49:09;49:10;"No, I just called."
49:10;49:12;"You were about to prank 1-800-TAMPONS."
49:12;49:14;"I was about to get you on the phone to prank."
49:14;49:16;"I mean, that would have been beautiful, right?"
49:16;49:17;"You would have--"
49:17;49:21;"Yeah, I could have got back in character, started crying."
49:21;49:25;"But there is-- but Matt did just send me"
49:25;49:30;"an article from the cut about four or five years ago, 2016."
49:30;49:31;"Here it is."
49:31;49:33;"There's now a tampon hotline because everyone hates"
49:33;49:35;"the new Tampax pocket pearl."
49:35;49:36;"So there does seem--"
49:36;49:39;"They brought it out of retirement."
49:39;49:40;"Yeah, maybe that's the--"
49:40;49:42;"They brought out a dud."
49:42;49:44;"It's like any kind of company."
49:44;49:47;"Yeah, I mean, I think it's a case where the hate is really--"
49:47;49:48;"it's really justified."

01:01:42;01:01:46;"So theoretically, Burger King could have picked any time in history,"
01:01:46;01:01:52;"or any Pride Month in history, to wage war on Chick-fil-A."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"But they're really only doing it--"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"Actually, you know what's messed up too?"
01:01:56;01:02:02;"Is it specifically says in the tweet, ""We'll donate money from every chicken sold"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"to the human rights campaign."""
01:02:04;01:02:06;"They didn't say from every meal."
01:02:06;01:02:09;"They said specifically, ""If you want money for gay rights,"
01:02:09;01:02:12;"you have to buy our random new chicken sandwich."""
01:02:12;01:02:14;"You're like, ""What if I want a Whopper?"""
01:02:14;01:02:16;"Well, sorry."
01:02:16;01:02:18;"Well, then you hate gay people."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"Yeah, we'll keep the money."
01:02:20;01:02:23;"Yeah, so actually, in a weird way, Burger King just actually--"
01:02:23;01:02:27;"rather than trolling Chick-fil-A, they trolled their own customers."
01:02:27;01:02:29;"Because I imagine the Chick-king--"
01:02:29;01:02:34;"Right, because it's anti-gay to buy anything but the new Chick-king sandwich."
01:02:34;01:02:36;"And who knows if the Chick-king sandwich is even--"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"the Chick-king is even good."
01:02:38;01:02:41;"Because it might not even be a top 10 Burger King item."
01:02:41;01:02:44;"So people are rolling in there during Pride Month saying,"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"""I'd like a Whopper with some fries."""
01:02:46;01:02:49;"And the person says, ""If you get the Chick-king, we'll give some money"

01:02:51;01:02:53;"And say, ""I really want a Whopper."""
01:02:53;01:02:55;"40 cents."
01:02:55;01:02:59;"Have you ever had a bad fast food chicken sandwich?"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"So they're all pretty good. They're fine."
01:03:01;01:03:05;"I'll say the Church's has a terrible one."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"Really?"
01:03:07;01:03:08;"Yeah."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"That's funny. I was just doing some research on Church's."
01:03:10;01:03:12;"Wait, what's the other one?"
01:03:12;01:03:14;"There's another really bad chicken sandwich"
01:03:14;01:03:17;"that tastes like how a urinal cake smells."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"Cool."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"It really does."
01:03:19;01:03:21;"And I've tried it more than once,"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"because I was like, ""There's no way it always tastes like this."""
01:03:23;01:03:24;"How could this be this bad?"
01:03:24;01:03:26;"Maybe someone f***ed on it."
01:03:26;01:03:28;"Man, what is the place called?"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"I remember this very vividly."
01:03:30;01:03:32;"We were in Miami."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"What's the Miami fast food spot?"
01:03:34;01:03:36;"I don't know."
01:03:36;01:03:38;"Anyway, really bad chicken sandwich."
01:03:38;01:03:42;"But other than that, I think every fast food chicken sandwich--"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"Wait, I have kind of a dumb question"
01:03:44;01:03:46;"that I'm surprised they don't have the answer for."
01:03:46;01:03:49;"Does McDonald's have a fried chicken sandwich?"
01:03:49;01:03:51;"Well, they have the McChicken or whatever."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"But McChicken's grilled."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"Or is McChicken fried?"
01:03:54;01:03:55;"Nah."
01:03:55;01:03:57;"There's both, I think."
01:03:57;01:03:59;"They do have a higher level--"
01:03:59;01:04:02;"They have a top-tier chicken sandwich as well."
01:04:02;01:04:04;"So there is the McChicken."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"That is fried."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"I think it's like their fish filet,"
01:04:08;01:04:10;"or filet of fish, rather."
01:04:10;01:04:13;"But then they have the deluxe--"
01:04:13;01:04:15;"That's not what it's called."
01:04:15;01:04:17;"There's the McChicken deluxe."
01:04:17;01:04:19;"The McChicken sandwich is great."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"Yeah."
01:04:21;01:04:24;"Is Sonic the urinal cake?"
01:04:24;01:04:25;"Nah."
01:04:25;01:04:27;"Just to put a button on that,"
01:04:27;01:04:30;"it's the crispy chicken deluxe,"
01:04:30;01:04:32;"which is part of their deluxe line."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"Yeah, they have a whole deluxe line."
01:04:34;01:04:36;"It's a cut above."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"Checkers. Is Checkers a urinal cake?"
01:04:38;01:04:40;"Yes. Checkers. Yeah."
01:04:40;01:04:42;"It's so bad."
01:04:44;01:04:46;"Actually, I think when I said churches,"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"I meant Checkers."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"Yeah, because Churches has a good reputation"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"for people like Churches."
01:04:52;01:04:54;"Yeah, Churches is like a chicken spot."
01:04:54;01:04:55;"Yeah."
01:04:55;01:04:57;"Checkers is f***ed up."
01:04:57;01:04:59;"Holy s***."
01:04:59;01:05:01;"I went to Miami."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"It was a stop on a tour,"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"and we routed it so that we could hang out"
01:05:05;01:05:07;"in Miami for a few days."
01:05:07;01:05:09;"And it rained the whole time."
01:05:09;01:05:11;"It poured, and it was really sad."
01:05:11;01:05:13;"And there was nothing to eat"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"in the hotel, but there was a Checkers"
01:05:15;01:05:16;"directly in front of it."
01:05:16;01:05:18;"And we just kept eating these pee-pee sandwiches,"
01:05:18;01:05:20;"even though they were really good."
01:05:20;01:05:23;"Why didn't you just switch to burgers?"
01:05:23;01:05:26;"I don't know, because it couldn't have been much better."
01:05:26;01:05:28;"I don't know. I don't know what was going on."
01:05:28;01:05:30;"You know, when you're on tour for a while,"
01:05:30;01:05:32;"you get into this fog at some point,"
01:05:32;01:05:35;"and you can't explain why you do anything, really."
01:05:35;01:05:37;"I don't know."
01:05:37;01:05:40;"You just wanted urinal cake chicken sandwiches."
01:05:40;01:05:42;"I thought it was going to get better,"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"and I was really excited about it getting better"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"at some point."
01:05:46;01:05:48;"But those things just taste like s***."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"You know what this makes me think of a little bit?"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"I don't know."
01:05:52;01:05:54;"You guys remember early--I'm sure you wouldn't,"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"but very early on the show,"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"I went to Iceland"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"just on a random vacation."
01:06:00;01:06:02;"And in Iceland, there's no McDonald's."
01:06:02;01:06:04;"McDonald's was outlawed from the country."
01:06:04;01:06:06;"Whoa!"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"No McDonald's?"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"No McDonald's in Iceland."
01:06:10;01:06:12;"Well, that's a whole other tangent."
01:06:12;01:06:14;"They were open,"
01:06:14;01:06:16;"and then they were exiled."
01:06:16;01:06:18;"They were eliminated from Iceland."
01:06:18;01:06:22;"But they do have a national burger chain"
01:06:22;01:06:25;"that's almost like a bootleg McDonald's."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"It's called Akto Takto."
01:06:27;01:06:29;"I was like, ""I gotta try this."""
01:06:29;01:06:32;"And it was the worst fast food I've ever--"
01:06:32;01:06:38;"It had all sorts of exotic European spices."
01:06:38;01:06:40;"It was quite--"
01:06:40;01:06:42;"It wasn't good."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"Akto Takto."
01:06:44;01:06:46;"Yeah, check it out."
01:06:46;01:06:49;"It's even designed to sort of look like McDonald's."
01:06:49;01:06:51;"God, I mean, it seems like the easiest--"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"And Burger R."
01:06:53;01:06:54;"What could go wrong?"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"That was how I felt about it, yeah."
01:06:56;01:06:58;"All right, Seinfeld, I need you to do--"
01:06:58;01:07:00;"make a little note here,"
01:07:00;01:07:02;"because I did some more research about the whole Chaking."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"And--"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"So Burger King specified"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"that it would donate 40 cents"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"for every Chaking sold this month"
01:07:10;01:07:13;"up to $250,000."
01:07:13;01:07:16;"So they're capping it at 250K."
01:07:16;01:07:19;"And I'm gonna do a number crunch here real quick,"
01:07:19;01:07:22;"because basically, I'd like for you to follow up"
01:07:22;01:07:25;"in July with Burger King"
01:07:25;01:07:30;"and find out if they made it to 250K."
01:07:30;01:07:32;"That would mean they sold--"
01:07:32;01:07:36;"they would have to sell 625,000 Chaking sandwiches"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"during Pride Month."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"I honestly don't know."
01:07:39;01:07:42;"Do you guys think that first month out,"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"June 2021,"
01:07:44;01:07:50;"is Burger King going to sell 625,000 Chakings?"
01:07:50;01:07:53;"Well, I think one thing that would be helpful--"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"I just looked up how many Burger King locations"
01:07:55;01:07:56;"there are in the US."
01:07:56;01:07:59;"There are 7,257."
01:07:59;01:08:00;"So what was it?"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"600 and how many?"
01:08:02;01:08:03;"Hold on, I'm on it."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"7,257?"
01:08:05;01:08:06;"Yeah."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"Okay, so each Burger King location"
01:08:08;01:08:10;"only has to sell 86."
01:08:10;01:08:12;"No problem."
01:08:12;01:08:13;"That seems reasonable."
01:08:13;01:08:14;"Yeah, I think that's doable."
01:08:14;01:08:15;"In a month? Yeah."
01:08:15;01:08:19;"So if they don't make it to $250,000"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"for the Human Rights Campaign,"
01:08:21;01:08:24;"either they're lying and taking money away"
01:08:24;01:08:25;"from a good cause,"
01:08:25;01:08:29;"or the Chaking sucks."
01:08:29;01:08:32;"And I would love to find out in July"
01:08:32;01:08:33;"what they did."
01:08:33;01:08:35;"And I would also just remind everybody"
01:08:35;01:08:38;"that we're not advocating you go buy a Chaking"
01:08:38;01:08:42;"because you could always go get a chicken sandwich--"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"not Chick-fil-A,"
01:08:43;01:08:46;"but you could always get a different chicken sandwich"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"and donate 40 cents or more"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"to the Human Rights Campaign"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"if you want to have that chicken sandwich"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"human rights combo."
01:08:54;01:08:56;"I don't think it can be Chick-fil-A"
01:08:56;01:08:57;"based on what I know about Chick-fil-A,"
01:08:57;01:09:01;"but you could probably roll to Checkers"
01:09:01;01:09:04;"or Sonic or something"
01:09:04;01:09:05;"and hit them with the 40 cents."
01:09:05;01:09:07;"But anyway, I'm very curious about this."
01:09:07;01:09:14;"Can the Chaking muster a meager 86 sold per location?"
01:09:14;01:09:15;"We'll see."
01:09:15;01:09:19;"Burger King's Chaking hit the scene nationwide June 3rd."
01:09:19;01:09:21;"The sandwich, two years in development,"
01:09:21;01:09:22;"is hand-breaded,"
01:09:22;01:09:25;"and I think that's the operative word here."
01:09:25;01:09:26;"Hand-breaded?"
01:09:26;01:09:27;"Hand-breaded."
01:09:27;01:09:29;"Yeah, so people, it's--"
01:09:29;01:09:33;"There's somebody in the back of a Burger King"
01:09:33;01:09:36;"who's taking the chicken cutlet,"
01:09:36;01:09:37;"dipping it in--"
01:09:37;01:09:38;"what is it?"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"Egg yolk and flour,"
01:09:40;01:09:44;"and then smacking it into the breadcrumbs?"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"Rolling it in crumbs."
01:09:46;01:09:48;"Burger King had to invest in fresh training"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"and equipment to make it."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"Fresh training."
01:09:51;01:09:53;"Yeah, fresh training."
01:09:53;01:09:55;"This is like a seismic event."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"They've been developing this for two years."
01:09:57;01:09:59;"I don't know if I stressed that enough."
01:09:59;01:10:01;"I mean, this is a seismic change,"
01:10:01;01:10:04;"and I think, you know, despite the name,"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"this isn't a flash in the pan."
01:10:06;01:10:07;"This is here to stay."
01:10:07;01:10:09;"But just one more thing on that."
01:10:09;01:10:11;"Per CNBC, the name hails from a customer"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"who, during testing, told employees"
01:10:13;01:10:17;"Burger King should change its name to Chicken King."
01:10:17;01:10:19;"So almost like an IHOP type of situation."
01:10:19;01:10:21;"Maybe there was a bit of a compromise there,"
01:10:21;01:10:22;"and they said, ""Well."""
01:10:22;01:10:25;"As an aside, I was on the OctuTalk2 website,"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"but I didn't really look at it."
01:10:27;01:10:30;"But they have some crazy combos."
01:10:30;01:10:33;"One of the big combos that they're advertising is--"
01:10:33;01:10:37;"do you know what a Prince Polo chocolate bar is?"
01:10:37;01:10:38;"I think I've seen that."
01:10:38;01:10:40;"I do, because I live in a Polish neighborhood,"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"and they're big here."
01:10:42;01:10:43;"Prince Polo?"
01:10:43;01:10:44;"Prince Polo."
01:10:45;01:10:46;"No."
01:10:46;01:10:49;"It's like a chocolate and hazelnut wafer chocolate bar."
01:10:49;01:10:50;"It's good."
01:10:50;01:10:55;"But this combo is a Prince Polo, a Coke, and a hot dog."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"Pretty weird."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"Yeah, that's just it."
01:10:58;01:11:01;"It was kind of an alternate universe thing."
01:11:01;01:11:05;"And by the way, I don't want to disparage our listeners in Europe."
01:11:05;01:11:08;"I just seem to remember the fries were seasoned with very--"
01:11:08;01:11:09;"it was very spicy fries."
01:11:09;01:11:13;"I don't know if you guys are into spice on your fries."
01:11:13;01:11:14;"I'll take some spice."
01:11:14;01:11:15;"I'm not mad at it."
01:11:15;01:11:16;"You'll take some spice on your fries?"
01:11:16;01:11:17;"Really? OK."
01:11:17;01:11:18;"I think for me."
01:11:18;01:11:22;"I think I was just going and expecting something very close to McDonald's,"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"and that's not what I got is all I'm saying."
01:11:24;01:11:27;"Doesn't Popeye's season the fries?"
01:11:27;01:11:29;"Yes, they do."
01:11:29;01:11:30;"Those are pretty good."
01:11:30;01:11:31;"OK, well, hold on, guys."
01:11:31;01:11:34;"So back to the chicken."
01:11:34;01:11:37;"First of all, they should have just called it the Chicken King."
01:11:37;01:11:38;"That's a cool name."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"Yeah, definitely."
01:11:39;01:11:40;"That would have been better."
01:11:40;01:11:43;"It's like the Fisher King, but it's chicken."
01:11:43;01:11:44;"The Chicken King."
01:11:44;01:11:45;"It's a good movie."
01:11:45;01:11:47;"This isn't even like a good origin story."
01:11:47;01:11:51;"The name hails from a customer who during testing told--"
01:11:51;01:11:55;"so what they were just doing one of these like awkward consumer tests,"
01:11:55;01:11:59;"a bunch of people like sitting in some like, you know,"
01:11:59;01:12:07;"depressing fluorescent light boardroom trying this new sandwich,"
01:12:07;01:12:11;"and there's one just like hyped up dude just being like,"
01:12:11;01:12:13;"""This sandwich is so good."
01:12:13;01:12:16;"You should change your name from Burger King to Chicken King."""
01:12:16;01:12:19;"And then just like the two people with clipboards like, ""Ooh, I like that,"
01:12:19;01:12:21;"and I love your enthusiasm, man."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"That's awesome."
01:12:22;01:12:25;"We're going to run that up the flagpole to corporate."
01:12:25;01:12:26;"That's so cool."""
01:12:26;01:12:31;"It sounds like the guy was quite possibly just being a d*ck."
01:12:31;01:12:33;"It was like, ""Oh, you're making chicken sandwiches?"
01:12:33;01:12:36;"Why don't you call yourself Chicken King, f*cking dork?"""
01:12:36;01:12:39;"And then they were like, ""Wow, great."""
01:12:39;01:12:40;"Awesome."
01:12:40;01:12:44;"We'll make it even stupider and we'll use an apostrophe."
01:12:44;01:12:45;"Oh, yeah."
01:12:45;01:12:47;"You guys should change your name to Chicken King."
01:12:47;01:12:49;"You really know what you're doing with chicken."
01:12:49;01:12:50;"[laughs]"
01:12:50;01:12:53;"But yeah, I'm looking at some figures over here."
01:12:53;01:12:58;"I mean, Chick-fil-A has far and away the biggest share"
01:12:58;01:13:01;"of the fast food chicken sandwich market,"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"and Burger King is like basically in last."
01:13:03;01:13:06;"So we'll see if this gambit pays off."
01:13:06;01:13:09;"But anyway, we talked about all this because we wanted to talk about Chick-fil-A."
01:13:09;01:13:12;"I don't mean just to beat up on the Chick King,"
01:13:12;01:13:15;"although please tune in two episodes from now"
01:13:15;01:13:21;"when Seinfeld will release our findings after we audit Burger King."
01:13:21;01:13:23;"Also, imagine that Burger King is just like,"
01:13:23;01:13:28;"""Well, yeah, we got about $47,000 for HRC."""
01:13:28;01:13:30;"And we're just like, ""Wow."""
01:13:30;01:13:36;"You couldn't just give the whole $250,000 plus the Chick King failed."
01:13:36;01:13:41;"But anyway, Seinfeld, what's the deal with Chick-fil-A?"
01:13:41;01:13:44;"So they really are--and I would like to point something out."
01:13:44;01:13:46;"I know this sounds crazy."
01:13:46;01:13:48;"I've never had Chick-fil-A in my life."
01:13:48;01:13:49;"-Whoa. -Wow."
01:13:49;01:13:50;"Never."
01:13:50;01:13:55;"Because of their value system or just your own values about fast food"
01:13:55;01:13:56;"or what's going on there?"
01:13:56;01:14:00;"It wasn't a big New York or like, you know, tri-state area thing until--"
01:14:00;01:14:03;"No, they definitely--they didn't have it in Jersey."
01:14:03;01:14:05;"Yeah, now they do have it everywhere."
01:14:05;01:14:08;"Well, first and foremost, as much as I give them a hard time,"
01:14:08;01:14:13;"I've always been a huge Chick King guy since January--June 3rd."
01:14:13;01:14:16;"So I'm a Chick King guy."
01:14:16;01:14:20;"I have some issues with some of the rollout, but I'm a Chick King guy."
01:14:20;01:14:23;"I think the truth is I never even heard of Chick-fil-A"
01:14:23;01:14:27;"until, like Alex said, they don't have it in the tri-state area."
01:14:27;01:14:28;"Or they didn't."
01:14:28;01:14:31;"I'd never heard of it until maybe I was in college"
01:14:31;01:14:34;"and maybe I met some people from Georgia or something."
01:14:34;01:14:37;"And I don't think I even had the chance to have it"
01:14:37;01:14:40;"until maybe I was touring in my mid-20s or something."
01:14:40;01:14:42;"So by the time it was even on my radar,"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"I had zero sentimental attachment to it."
01:14:44;01:14:49;"I don't even care that much about fried chicken sandwiches to begin with."
01:14:49;01:14:51;"And then on top of that, people are telling me"
01:14:51;01:14:54;"that they're giving money to anti-gay stuff."
01:14:54;01:14:59;"So whatever small part of me was like, ""I got to try this,"""
01:14:59;01:15:00;"it was extinguished."
01:15:00;01:15:03;"So I'm not trying to say, you know, that I'm a saint."
01:15:03;01:15:06;"And I was like, ""Oh, I'll stop eating my favorite sandwich ever."""
01:15:06;01:15:11;"No, but I do remember once or twice,"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"let's say like the three times in my life anybody said,"
01:15:13;01:15:15;"""Oh, you never had Chick-fil-A? Do you want to go?"""
01:15:15;01:15:18;"I just said, ""No, that's my Chick-fil-A story."""
01:15:18;01:15:20;"I was like, ""Eh, I don't need to go to Chick-fil-A."""
01:15:20;01:15:25;"- That's a story of standing up for what you believe in."
01:15:25;01:15:27;"- Yeah, it's courageous."
01:15:27;01:15:30;"I'd say, you know, if I could boil it down,"
01:15:30;01:15:33;"the history of--I mean, Chick-fil-A really is founded on two,"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"I would say, core values."
01:15:35;01:15:37;"One being technology."
01:15:37;01:15:41;"You know, it was started when S. Truett Cathy,"
01:15:41;01:15:44;"the founder of Chick-fil-A,"
01:15:44;01:15:48;"according to their history, he found a pressure fryer"
01:15:48;01:15:53;"that could cook a chicken sandwich in the same amount of time as a burger."
01:15:53;01:15:55;"That was in 1961."
01:15:55;01:15:58;"So if you can imagine how revolutionary that would be"
01:15:58;01:16:01;"where this person discovers this--it says ""found."""
01:16:01;01:16:04;"The word is ""found."" He found this fryer and goes,"
01:16:04;01:16:07;"""Oh, my goodness, there's a whole business model"
01:16:07;01:16:11;"that I can kind of derive from this technology."""
01:16:11;01:16:16;"And then the other core value is his devout religious belief."
01:16:16;01:16:19;"He was a devout Southern Baptist."
01:16:19;01:16:23;"And so that fervor sort of made its way into the DNA of the company"
01:16:23;01:16:25;"all the way to today."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"And of course, one of the biggest parts of that"
01:16:27;01:16:30;"is that the restaurant does not open on Sundays,"
01:16:30;01:16:33;"which ties us back to that Burger King tweet."
01:16:33;01:16:37;"And a very telling example is that the Chick-fil-A"
01:16:37;01:16:40;"at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta,"
01:16:40;01:16:44;"which I know we're all fans of that--I mean, it's a great stadium."
01:16:44;01:16:46;"That Chick-fil-A closes on Sunday,"
01:16:46;01:16:51;"even though the Falcons play most of their home games on Sundays."
01:16:51;01:16:55;"So they are adamant about this ""no Sundays"" thing."
01:16:55;01:16:57;"And of course, the other--"
01:16:57;01:16:59;"They'll take that hit. That's a big hit."
01:16:59;01:17:02;"And that's got to be the vast majority of events."
01:17:02;01:17:05;"The whole year of events at that stadium,"
01:17:05;01:17:08;"I'd imagine Falcon games are like the biggest thing."
01:17:08;01:17:11;"What else happens? Like a marching band competition"
01:17:11;01:17:14;"with like a tenth of the attendance?"
01:17:14;01:17:17;"Maybe like a mega church event, which would also happen on Sunday."
01:17:17;01:17:18;"Yeah."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"So they're just screwed."
01:17:19;01:17:22;"A Garth Brooks concert that might happen on Sunday?"
01:17:22;01:17:25;"He only performs on Sunday."
01:17:25;01:17:30;"So basically, in some ways, Chick-fil-A has a monument"
01:17:30;01:17:34;"to their faith in Mercedes-Benz Stadium"
01:17:34;01:17:38;"because basically it's only there just to remind"
01:17:38;01:17:41;"all the Falcons fans that we will not serve you food today."
01:17:41;01:17:44;"That it's closed. Yeah."
01:17:44;01:17:45;"Yeah, it's sort of--"
01:17:45;01:17:49;"That Chick-fil-A is a false idol in and of itself,"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"if you think about it."
01:17:51;01:17:54;"It's like a big statue of Jesus, except it's a Chick-fil-A."
01:17:54;01:17:58;"The Old Testament would not f*** with that restaurant at all."
01:17:58;01:18:00;"If anybody's not--"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"If we got any real Christians in the house,"
01:18:02;01:18:05;"real Christian Falcon fans, you should destroy that Chick-fil-A"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"because it is a false idol."
01:18:45;01:19:03;"I also have a question. This is kind of naive."
01:19:03;01:19:06;"This might be a hard one to number crunch."
01:19:06;01:19:09;"Of course, Sunday is famously the Lord's Day,"
01:19:09;01:19:12;"but obviously in a lot of different faiths,"
01:19:12;01:19:15;"what you can and cannot do on a holy day"
01:19:15;01:19:18;"is a matter of interpretation sometimes"
01:19:18;01:19:21;"or a matter of which denomination you're a part of."
01:19:21;01:19:24;"So, you're not supposed to work on Sundays."
01:19:24;01:19:27;"Are you allowed to go to watch a Falcons game?"
01:19:27;01:19:31;"Could you be a devout Southern Baptist and go cheer on the Falcons?"
01:19:31;01:19:34;"I guess what I'm asking is, what's the actual theology"
01:19:34;01:19:36;"behind Chick-fil-A being closed on Sunday?"
01:19:36;01:19:39;"Is it because they shouldn't be making people work on Sunday?"
01:19:39;01:19:43;"Or is it because they don't want people coming to Chick-fil-A?"
01:19:43;01:19:45;"You know what I mean?"
01:19:45;01:19:48;"Yeah, no, I'm pretty sure it's the work thing."
01:19:48;01:19:51;"I think leisure is fine,"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"but it's more from the company standpoint."
01:19:53;01:19:56;"We will not operate because it violates the sacred,"
01:19:56;01:20:00;"the sacrament of our Christian beliefs."
01:20:00;01:20:02;"I think so."
01:20:02;01:20:04;"On their web, it's pretty clear."
01:20:04;01:20:07;"It's the Truett Cathy in '46,"
01:20:07;01:20:10;"who founded Chick-fil-A,"
01:20:10;01:20:14;"said that having worked seven days a week in restaurants open 24 hours,"
01:20:14;01:20:17;"that he saw an importance of closing on Sundays"
01:20:17;01:20:22;"so that he and his employees could set aside one day to rest and worship if they chose."
01:20:22;01:20:25;"So, I think it's really just to say, ""Hey, guys."""
01:20:25;01:20:27;"It's non-denominational."
01:20:27;01:20:30;"Yeah, let's just--it's a pause."
01:20:30;01:20:34;"Which is interesting because if you were Jewish, for example,"
01:20:34;01:20:37;"you'd like to have that day on Saturday, probably."
01:20:37;01:20:38;"Right."
01:20:38;01:20:41;"So, maybe it's not non-denominational,"
01:20:41;01:20:43;"but it's being sold as that."
01:20:43;01:20:45;"Yeah, they still chose Sundays."
01:20:45;01:20:46;"Yeah."
01:20:46;01:20:47;"Well, that's somewhat kind vibe."
01:20:47;01:20:49;"He's almost on some like, ""Listen, we got to--"
01:20:49;01:20:52;"the working person needs some time to relax."""
01:20:52;01:20:54;"And they don't have to go to church, but they have to relax."
01:20:54;01:20:57;"But I guess it's not actually that kind vibe,"
01:20:57;01:21:00;"ultimately, of a company."
01:21:00;01:21:02;"Well, also, couldn't they just say,"
01:21:02;01:21:05;"""We're not going to make any of our own employees work seven days a week."""
01:21:05;01:21:07;"You know?"
01:21:07;01:21:10;"Like, ""We'll give you one day off paid."""
01:21:10;01:21:16;"Maybe on Sundays, if you're not Christian, you come work."
01:21:16;01:21:19;"Well, but then you have to take into account"
01:21:19;01:21:23;"that the corporate structure of Chick-fil-A needs Sunday off."
01:21:23;01:21:25;"Right, the whole business thing."
01:21:25;01:21:29;"Do you hire a bunch of non-Christians to run the office on Sunday?"
01:21:29;01:21:30;"I don't think so."
01:21:30;01:21:33;"Yeah, and I guess if they're open, you could get into some trouble"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"because if the restaurants are open,"
01:21:35;01:21:38;"as true at Cathy, would have to have his like antenna on"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"and get a call just like--"
01:21:40;01:21:43;"It kind of sounds like a dumb old joke,"
01:21:43;01:21:48;"but like, ""Okay, Mr. Cathy, we got a Muslim,"
01:21:48;01:21:52;"a Jew, and a Hindu running a Chick-fil-A in Atlanta,"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"and there's a big problem."

01:21:55;01:21:58;"He said, ""You know what? This is why I just wanted them closed on Sunday."
01:21:58;01:22:00;"It doesn't work for me."""
01:22:00;01:22:02;"He'd be like, ""I heard this one already."""
01:22:02;01:22:05;"Yeah, ""I heard this joke before, and I don't like it."""
01:22:05;01:22:10;"To be clear, as true at Cathy, did pass away in 2014."
01:22:10;01:22:15;"It's currently run by his son, Dan, who is chairman and CEO."
01:22:15;01:22:19;"His brother, Bubba, is executive vice president,"
01:22:19;01:22:22;"and their sister, Trudy, is the ambassador."
01:22:22;01:22:25;"Trudy Cathy is a sick name, so is Bubba Cathy."
01:22:25;01:22:28;"Yeah, Bubba Cathy is a great name."
01:22:28;01:22:30;"There's a bit of a Righteous Gemstones--"
01:22:30;01:22:31;"I was about to say that."

01:23:07;01:23:08;"Interesting."
01:23:08;01:23:11;"It was called Dwarf Grill,"
01:23:11;01:23:15;"and then later he renamed it Dwarf House."
01:23:15;01:23:20;"Seinfeld, do you have any info on why he called it Dwarf Grill"
01:23:20;01:23:23;"and then Dwarf House?"

01:23:25;01:23:27;"No, I don't."
01:23:27;01:23:30;"It looks like Dwarf House still exists."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"Oh, okay."
01:23:32;01:23:34;"So I googled Dwarf Grill,"
01:23:34;01:23:36;"and one of the questions at the top goes,"
01:23:36;01:23:40;"""What is different about Chick-fil-A Dwarf House?"""

01:23:49;01:23:52;"He started with Dwarf House, then it became Chick-fil-A."
01:23:52;01:23:56;"But then real quick, so what's the real deal with--"
01:23:56;01:24:01;"look, nothing wrong with being a man of faith, Mr. Cathy,"

01:24:34;01:24:37;"I mean, yeah. Exactly."
01:24:37;01:24:40;"It looks like he tried to then clarify the comments"
01:24:40;01:24:43;"and dug himself a little deeper."

01:34:55;01:34:57;"- All right, so now we got Bruce Horn's ""Beyond."""
01:34:57;01:34:59;"Welcome back to the show, Bruce."
01:34:59;01:35:01;"- Yes, good to be here."
01:35:01;01:35:05;"- This is a very special edition 'cause Jake got sick"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"and he had to bail on this episode on the last minute,"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"so we've been reaching out to various friends of the show"
01:35:09;01:35:13;"to come through, and we thought maybe we'd check in with you."
01:35:13;01:35:18;"- Well, you caught me about 20 minutes before I got the message"
01:35:18;01:35:22;"when I just walked off stage and checked my phone"
01:35:22;01:35:26;"near Syracuse, New York, where we were trying to give it up"
01:35:26;01:35:31;"to the people, and so that was great fun."
01:35:31;01:35:36;"So yeah, we're just heading to--got a nice nine-hour drive"
01:35:36;01:35:38;"to Richmond, Virginia. We play there tomorrow night,"
01:35:38;01:35:41;"and then I'm home. So just grinding through it"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"using the Riggs method."
01:35:43;01:35:45;"- Oh, right. Last time we hung out, we were talking about"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"the Riggs vocal warm-up method. That's working out for you?"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"How's the voice holding up?"
01:35:49;01:35:53;"- So far, not terrible. Not--yeah, you can probably hear"
01:35:53;01:35:58;"it's crusty, but not--going for an Otis Redding feeling,"
01:35:58;01:36:02;"not quite getting there, but Joe Cocker-esque, maybe."
01:36:02;01:36:04;"- Okay, nothing wrong with that."
01:36:04;01:36:05;"- Not at all."
01:36:05;01:36:09;"- Well, so Bruce, the crew today, we got Seinfeld 2000,"
01:36:09;01:36:14;"and Nick around here, as always, and then I'm sure you remember"
01:36:14;01:36:18;"Alec, aka Deathspot, who we had a pizza party with in LA,"
01:36:18;01:36:20;"is a guest host."
01:36:20;01:36:25;"- Yeah, okay. Mm-hmm. And so, are these guys--"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"these guys want to try to stump me or something,"
01:36:27;01:36:28;"or ask me a question?"
01:36:28;01:36:31;"- Well, we did want to share with you--it's not a question,"
01:36:31;01:36:35;"but we uncovered something, a very unusual fun fact today"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"that we did want to share with you."
01:36:37;01:36:38;"- Please do, yes, go."
01:36:38;01:36:41;"- Okay, and it's going to sound weird when I say it,"
01:36:41;01:36:45;"but we found out today, and we weren't looking for anything"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"related to the Grateful Dead. I know you probably feel like"
01:36:47;01:36:50;"you have people shoehorning Grateful Dead stuff into conversation"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"with you all the time. This is not it."
01:36:52;01:36:53;"We found out today--"
01:36:53;01:36:54;"- Not so much."
01:36:54;01:36:58;"- That the first podcast was a Grateful Dead song."
01:36:58;01:37:03;"- The first podcast ever produced, ever on,"
01:37:03;01:37:06;"was a Grateful Dead, or your podcast."
01:37:06;01:37:09;"- No, no, no. The first podcast ever produced"
01:37:09;01:37:13;"was a Grateful Dead song. I know it sounds crazy."
01:37:13;01:37:16;"Does that mean--can you make heads or tails of that statement?"
01:37:16;01:37:21;"- I could kind of not, yeah. I cannot make heads or tails."
01:37:21;01:37:26;"So, a podcast was a song, okay?"
01:37:26;01:37:30;"So, the contents of the first podcast contained"
01:37:30;01:37:34;"a Grateful Dead song played ad nauseum,"
01:37:34;01:37:37;"or maybe an hour-long version of a song, and that was the podcast?"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"- No, they just played ""U.S. Blues"" once."
01:37:39;01:37:42;"- Wow, that's a short song. That's about a three-and-a-half-minute,"
01:37:42;01:37:44;"four-minute song, ""U.S. Blues."" It's a great song. I love it."
01:37:44;01:37:46;"- And it's a very short podcast."
01:37:46;01:37:49;"- Well, okay. So, maybe the first one still holds the record"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"for the shortest podcast ever."
01:37:51;01:37:53;"- It was also the shortest podcast."
01:37:53;01:37:56;"We barely understand what this means, but essentially,"
01:37:56;01:37:59;"one of the first times somebody officially--"
01:37:59;01:38:02;"Seinfeld, can you explain it one more time?"
01:38:02;01:38:03;"- Yeah, um--"
01:38:03;01:38:05;"- It sounds like some pretty key information"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"that we all need to know about."
01:38:07;01:38:10;"- It's great for parties."
01:38:10;01:38:14;"It's a great icebreaker."
01:38:14;01:38:16;"Look, I think the best way to understand it"
01:38:16;01:38:19;"is that it's being compared to the first transmission"
01:38:19;01:38:22;"on a telephone by Alexander Graham Bell,"
01:38:22;01:38:25;"where essentially, emerging podcast technology"
01:38:25;01:38:29;"was used to upload and make available for download"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"the Grateful Dead song, ""U.S. Blues,"""
01:38:31;01:38:35;"which sort of makes it considered the first podcast,"
01:38:35;01:38:39;"even though it didn't contain the formal attributes"
01:38:39;01:38:41;"of the podcast as we know it today."
01:38:41;01:38:42;"So, it's kind of like--"
01:38:42;01:38:46;"- It was like a test run for the tubes."
01:38:46;01:38:48;"It was a test run for the technology."
01:38:48;01:38:52;"- And was it a test run going from someone"
01:38:52;01:38:55;"to someone else in the same house like Bell?"
01:38:55;01:38:58;"- This was from one person to the world on the internet"
01:38:58;01:39:02;"who, you know, the audience who were aware of this technology."
01:39:02;01:39:05;"From what I could tell, it wasn't very popular."
01:39:05;01:39:07;"It doesn't seem like a lot of people--"
01:39:07;01:39:10;"It was too new of a technology to catch on in a big way,"
01:39:10;01:39:13;"but it's technically the first sort of instance"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"of that technology used."
01:39:15;01:39:17;"- Well, it sounds like it's maxed--"
01:39:17;01:39:21;"It has the footprints of John Barlow"
01:39:21;01:39:23;"that could be found on this."
01:39:23;01:39:25;"Was this a Barlow production?"
01:39:25;01:39:26;"- No, that's a good call."
01:39:26;01:39:30;"No, yeah, John Barlow wrote lyrics for Bob Weir."
01:39:30;01:39:32;"He was an early internet doctor."
01:39:32;01:39:33;"- He was such an internet--"
01:39:33;01:39:36;"Yes, he was a real innovator in the early days"
01:39:36;01:39:38;"from what I understand."
01:39:38;01:39:40;"I mean, it's not--"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"- So to give it some context,"
01:39:42;01:39:45;"so this--the song was uploaded--"
01:39:45;01:39:51;"It was basically in response to Bush being elected in 2001."
01:39:51;01:39:54;"So they put US Blues up."
01:39:54;01:39:56;"It was on inauguration."
01:39:56;01:39:58;"Someone posted this."
01:39:58;01:40:00;"So in some ways, it is a commentary."
01:40:00;01:40:02;"There's just no talking over it."
01:40:02;01:40:06;"And then he continued, I guess, over the course--"
01:40:06;01:40:08;"the person who did this,"
01:40:08;01:40:12;"who was the first guy to do this was Adam--"
01:40:12;01:40:15;"- Adam Kurya, a former MTV VJ."
01:40:15;01:40:18;"- Yeah, and he then continued to upload"
01:40:18;01:40:22;"a few more dead songs to that podcast."
01:40:22;01:40:25;"So I guess after a few months or a year"
01:40:25;01:40:26;"of sort of experimenting,"
01:40:26;01:40:28;"I guess you could say the podcast was,"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"you know, probably ended up being 17 minutes long"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"or something like that would be my guess."
01:40:32;01:40:36;"But so it did have a commentary"
01:40:36;01:40:37;"sort of attached to it."
01:40:37;01:40:39;"- Okay, that's good to know."
01:40:39;01:40:41;"- And so were the extra songs,"
01:40:41;01:40:42;"were they sort of--"
01:40:42;01:40:46;"you could call US Blues slightly political."
01:40:46;01:40:48;"Were the other dead songs included?"
01:40:48;01:40:49;"Did they also have some of this?"
01:40:49;01:40:53;"I don't remember dead songs being too political too often."
01:40:53;01:40:54;"- No, no."
01:40:54;01:40:56;"I think--I guess you could basically say"
01:40:56;01:40:59;"that the first podcast basically just became"
01:40:59;01:41:01;"a collection of dead songs."
01:41:01;01:41:03;"- A collection of Grateful Dead songs."
01:41:03;01:41:05;"- Yeah, I don't think that they served any purpose."
01:41:05;01:41:08;"- This is such an interesting fun fact"
01:41:08;01:41:11;"because on the one hand, it's so fun."
01:41:11;01:41:14;"It's wild that these things are together"
01:41:14;01:41:16;"and yet it's so not fun"
01:41:16;01:41:18;"'cause it's so difficult to explain."
01:41:18;01:41:23;"It seems like something you should be telling everybody."
01:41:23;01:41:26;"But imagine, Bruce, after this, you call Bob Weir"
01:41:26;01:41:29;"and say, ""Hey, Bob, I heard something really interesting."""
01:41:29;01:41:32;"He's just like, ""Man, what are you talking about?"""
01:41:32;01:41:33;"- Yeah, I would tell him--"
01:41:33;01:41:34;"I guess I would tell him that--"
01:41:34;01:41:36;"I'd say, ""Hey, Bobby, I heard that"
01:41:36;01:41:40;"""the Grateful Dead crowd is responsible"
01:41:40;01:41:43;"""for the first podcast ever disseminated,"""
01:41:43;01:41:46;"and he would probably--yeah, he'd probably do"
01:41:46;01:41:47;"like what you said."
01:41:47;01:41:49;"He'd probably say, ""What the hell are you talking about?"
01:41:49;01:41:50;"""You sound crazy."""
01:41:50;01:41:51;"[laughing]"
01:41:51;01:41:54;"But I can call him and try him if you want me to."
01:41:54;01:41:55;"Well, you can too."
01:41:55;01:41:58;"- Well, I think we've talked about this enough."
01:41:58;01:42:00;"I mean, I also want to know,"
01:42:00;01:42:02;"just since we caught you right after the show,"
01:42:02;01:42:06;"so you've just done a week of your first shows post-COVID,"
01:42:06;01:42:07;"right?"
01:42:07;01:42:08;"- Yes, that's right."
01:42:08;01:42:10;"- So what's happening in the world of live music?"
01:42:10;01:42:11;"How was it?"
01:42:11;01:42:12;"What's the vibe?"
01:42:12;01:42:19;"- Well, big crowds and fairly boisterous crowds"
01:42:19;01:42:22;"'cause they can't believe they're out doing this,"
01:42:22;01:42:25;"and so they're sort of euphoric about it,"
01:42:25;01:42:29;"and so we're the nice recipients of that vibe,"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"although tonight was a little less so."
01:42:31;01:42:33;"Tonight was a little deader,"
01:42:33;01:42:35;"and I don't know why that--"
01:42:35;01:42:36;"I'm not going to blame us."
01:42:36;01:42:38;"I usually would, but in this case, I'm not."
01:42:38;01:42:40;"But yeah, so it's been good."
01:42:40;01:42:43;"It's been--I think that pretty much explains it."
01:42:43;01:42:47;"It's been a joyful noise that we've made"
01:42:47;01:42:48;"for a joyful audience because--"
01:42:48;01:42:50;"- And are you playing outdoors exclusively,"
01:42:50;01:42:51;"or are you playing indoors too now?"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"- Yeah, these are all--no, these are all--"
01:42:53;01:42:54;"no, these are all outdoors."
01:42:54;01:42:56;"I love playing indoors."
01:42:56;01:43:00;"Maybe more, but no, these are all outdoors."
01:43:00;01:43:04;"When we play--we got a couple of festivals"
01:43:04;01:43:08;"in the Rocky Mountains and Wyoming and Colorado,"
01:43:08;01:43:11;"the Alliance Folk Festival for one"
01:43:11;01:43:14;"and some other one in Casper, Wyoming."
01:43:14;01:43:17;"But otherwise, our main next run is in September,"
01:43:17;01:43:18;"and a lot of those are indoors"
01:43:18;01:43:20;"because I guess everyone feels like by then,"
01:43:20;01:43:21;"it'll be safe."
01:43:21;01:43:23;"And so--but it's so funny."
01:43:23;01:43:25;"Okay, so two nights ago, we played"
01:43:25;01:43:28;"in Westport, Connecticut,"
01:43:28;01:43:31;"and, oh, they had it all marked off."
01:43:31;01:43:35;"It was a big lawn and no seats,"
01:43:35;01:43:39;"and all the pods were clearly delineated"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"by chalk on the grass."
01:43:41;01:43:45;"And so there was spaces where no one was supposed to be."
01:43:45;01:43:47;"Well, we got out there,"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"and everyone had completely ignored that"
01:43:49;01:43:53;"and was not feeling worried at all about it, obviously."
01:43:53;01:43:56;"So it was just one big mass of people."
01:43:56;01:43:59;"So that--I don't think that was supposed to happen,"
01:43:59;01:44:02;"but nobody felt too freaked about it to stop it,"
01:44:02;01:44:03;"and so that was--so that--"
01:44:03;01:44:07;"that's one, you know, early post-COVID-era story,"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"which was--which was fun."
01:44:09;01:44:10;"We liked that."
01:44:10;01:44:11;"We thought it would be a little strange."
01:44:11;01:44:12;"Now, tonight, it was more--"
01:44:12;01:44:14;"the people were more diligent."
01:44:14;01:44:15;"They were more dutiful,"
01:44:15;01:44:18;"and they stayed in their little areas,"
01:44:18;01:44:21;"and so that may have contributed to"
01:44:21;01:44:24;"why it was a little less rowdy, okay?"
01:44:24;01:44:25;"If you understand what I'm saying."
01:44:25;01:44:27;"- Right. Yeah, 'cause it's still--"
01:44:27;01:44:29;"they're still easing their way back"
01:44:29;01:44:31;"into the regular concert vibe."
01:44:31;01:44:33;"- Yeah, yeah, that's right."
01:44:33;01:44:36;"So some are really comfortable"
01:44:36;01:44:37;"and not worried about distancing,"
01:44:37;01:44:40;"and others are a little more concerned."
01:44:40;01:44:42;"So, hey, we just do what we're doing,"
01:44:42;01:44:43;"and we have one more, like I said,"
01:44:43;01:44:46;"enrichment, and then we break."
01:44:46;01:44:49;"But, yeah, so that's that."

01:46:37;01:46:41;"- We were talking about the history of Chick-fil-A recently."
01:46:41;01:46:44;"So, um, I gotta ask,"
01:46:44;01:46:47;"and you're technically from the South."
01:46:47;01:46:48;"- Yes."
01:46:48;01:46:51;"- Which is where fried chicken sandwiches come from, I believe."
01:46:51;01:46:53;"- Yeah, you would say where I'm from is,"
01:46:53;01:46:55;"I think where I'm from is called Upper South."
01:46:55;01:46:56;"- Upper South."
01:46:56;01:46:58;"- Right below the Mason-Dixon line."
01:46:58;01:47:00;"- Right, just below."
01:47:00;01:47:03;"So, A, do you care about fried chicken sandwiches?"
01:47:03;01:47:06;"And sandwiches B, which are the best?"
01:47:06;01:47:10;"- Well, I don't really give a flying about fried chicken sandwiches,"
01:47:10;01:47:13;"but my family is mad for Chick-fil-A."
01:47:13;01:47:16;"I also have, to be honest, a bit of a,"
01:47:16;01:47:21;"I'm a little persnickety about the political area"
01:47:21;01:47:25;"that this Chick-fil-A management deals in."
01:47:25;01:47:27;"And that makes me,"
01:47:27;01:47:32;"I'm not that interested in getting their sandwich,"
01:47:32;01:47:35;"but I'm really not as interested when I hear other things."
01:47:35;01:47:38;"So, yeah, I'm not trying to be incendiary here,"
01:47:38;01:47:41;"but that's how I feel about it, not feeling that."
01:47:41;01:47:46;"So, yeah, but mostly chicken sandwiches, no big thing to me."
01:47:46;01:47:50;"I guess I'm more of a taco hell,"
01:47:50;01:47:54;"and I like the Beyond Burgers,"
01:47:54;01:47:58;"'cause it makes me feel much more healthy."
01:47:58;01:47:59;"And of course they could fool me,"
01:47:59;01:48:03;"because some of these fake burgers really taste pretty good."
01:48:03;01:48:04;"- Oh, absolutely."
01:48:04;01:48:06;"- So that's it."
01:48:06;01:48:10;"- Also environmentally responsible."
01:48:10;01:48:13;"- Well, let's hope, that's what they're telling us."
01:48:13;01:48:17;"It could be all a ruse, but I hope it's not."
01:48:17;01:48:19;"- Most things are."
01:48:19;01:48:21;"- Well, I think everyone here on this call"
01:48:21;01:48:25;"becomes a fairly cynical place about all this."
01:48:25;01:48:26;"And so, yes."
01:48:26;01:48:28;"- It's a world of illusion."
01:48:28;01:48:31;"- Oh, but sorry, Bruce, one last thing,"
01:48:31;01:48:32;"because we saw that you tweeted,"
01:48:32;01:48:37;"it was recently what would have been Tupac's 50th birthday."
01:48:37;01:48:40;"You had a nice tribute to him on Twitter,"
01:48:40;01:48:44;"where you said that of all the rap versions"
01:48:44;01:48:46;"who sampled your famous song the way it is,"
01:48:46;01:48:49;"""Changes"" by Tupac is your favorite."
01:48:49;01:48:53;"But there really are like, there's a bunch of other ones."
01:48:53;01:48:55;"- Oh, yeah, there's some really good ones."
01:48:55;01:48:57;"Yeah, Akon, I love."
01:48:57;01:48:59;"Akon, I love the most, maybe it's 'cause it's the newest,"
01:48:59;01:49:04;"but are you familiar with the Chicago rapper Polo G?"
01:49:04;01:49:07;"- Yeah, he's like huge now, right?"
01:49:07;01:49:09;"- He's gigantic now."
01:49:09;01:49:13;"- He's really great, and he did a fantastic version"
01:49:13;01:49:17;"of the way it is called ""Wishing for a Hero."""
01:49:17;01:49:18;"I would say he would probably say"
01:49:18;01:49:22;"it's more of an homage to Tupac, and hence my song."
01:49:22;01:49:26;"And I had a great time with this young man, Polo G."
01:49:26;01:49:30;"We did a remote duet for the Virtual Bonnaroo Festival"
01:49:30;01:49:35;"last September, and so we actually performed together,"
01:49:35;01:49:38;"quote, unquote, but I really love his version."
01:49:38;01:49:39;"It's really good."
01:49:39;01:49:41;"It has a great line in there,"
01:49:41;01:49:44;"""They killed Martin for Dreamin', and now I can't sleep."""
01:49:44;01:49:47;"And that really resonated to me."
01:49:47;01:49:52;"So I love Polo G, I love Akon, Snoop Dogg,"
01:49:52;01:49:55;"and some guy named, I don't know,"
01:49:55;01:49:58;"I forget the name, Brother Lynch Hung maybe,"
01:49:58;01:50:00;"did a version that I like."
01:50:00;01:50:05;"But I think my favorites are Changes, Tops, Polo G2,"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"and Akon 3, but I'm probably forgetting something"
01:50:07;01:50:10;"'cause there's been, I think there have been 17."
01:50:10;01:50:12;"- Oh. - If I look at the last count."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"Yeah, that's great, Steve."
01:50:14;01:50:17;"- Across four decades, there have been versions,"
01:50:17;01:50:19;"'cause of course your version came out in the '80s,"
01:50:19;01:50:23;"Tupac was in the '90s, and then through the 2000s, 2000,"
01:50:23;01:50:27;"I guess five decades actually, '80s, '90s,"
01:50:27;01:50:32;"thousands, tens, and now the '20s again."
01:50:32;01:50:35;"- Yeah, the early part of the '20s."
01:50:35;01:50:38;"Yeah, 'cause it's 35 years since the way it came out"
01:50:38;01:50:41;"and broke in England in August of '86."
01:50:41;01:50:44;"So, right, 35 years."
01:50:44;01:50:49;"And so one every couple years almost, 17."
01:50:49;01:50:52;"So that's, it's always fun to hear."
01:50:52;01:50:54;"Oh, you know what?"
01:50:54;01:50:57;"The rapper Mase had a pretty good one."
01:50:57;01:50:59;"- Really? - Anyway, I could keep going."
01:50:59;01:51:01;"There's a lot, there's lots of good, but yeah,"
01:51:01;01:51:04;"that's my top three, and Tupac is,"
01:51:04;01:51:07;"I mean, probably always, and I think it's,"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"it had the greatest impact, I think."
01:51:09;01:51:12;"It gave me great credibility with my son Keith's"
01:51:12;01:51:14;"AAU basketball teams, where he was the only white dude"
01:51:14;01:51:19;"on the team, from age 10 to 17."
01:51:19;01:51:21;"And so these kids--"
01:51:21;01:51:24;"- Right when the Tupac song was a big hit."
01:51:24;01:51:27;"- Yes, right, right, just a little bit after that."
01:51:27;01:51:30;"I think Tupac came out, I think Changes came out in '98,"
01:51:30;01:51:33;"and Keith started playing in 2002."
01:51:33;01:51:36;"So that was, and look, Changes is still,"
01:51:36;01:51:38;"Changes still has a huge presence."
01:51:38;01:51:41;"So that was fun for me. - Oh, absolutely."
01:51:41;01:51:44;"- Yeah, that was good that the young brothers"
01:51:44;01:51:46;"looked at me a little differently when they found out"
01:51:46;01:51:48;"that I wrote that, and worked for Spike Lee."
01:51:48;01:51:53;"So that gave me nice cred with the Boo Williams AAU program."
01:51:53;01:51:56;"- Well, Bruce, thanks so much for jumping on the phone"
01:51:56;01:51:57;"at the last minute."
01:51:57;01:51:59;"So glad to know that you're back on the road,"
01:51:59;01:52:02;"and let's get you on TC more regularly,"
01:52:02;01:52:04;"and happy birthday, Tupac."
01:52:04;01:52:08;"- And if you tell anybody about this Grateful Dead podcast"
01:52:08;01:52:10;"being the first podcast, let us know"
01:52:10;01:52:12;"what their responses are."
01:52:12;01:52:14;"- Okay, I'll be back."
01:52:14;01:52:16;"- Phil Lesh just hangs up the phone,"
01:52:16;01:52:18;"just like, ""Man, I don't have time for this."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"""What the (beep) did you just say?"""
01:52:20;01:52:22;"All right, Bruce, have a good one, man."
01:52:22;01:52:23;"We'll talk soon."
01:52:23;01:52:25;"- Okay, as we're talking soon."
01:52:25;01:52:26;"Bye. - All right, bye."
