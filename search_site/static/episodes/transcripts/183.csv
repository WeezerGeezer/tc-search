00:04;00:07;"Horse meat sashimi"
00:07;00:10;"It's a very 90s episode of time crisis"
00:10;00:15;"We got some great guests and some great conversation"
00:15;00:19;"Stick around you're not gonna want to miss this one"
00:19;00:22;"here on"
00:22;00:25;"Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
00:25;00:27;"*music*"
00:35;00:45;"All of those great romances they were a threat, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:45;00:53;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:53;01:04;"And so I dealt to the blow. One of us had to go. Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:04;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying. Leave it on me babe."
01:15;01:21;"Time crisis back again. How many time zones are we in today? I'm in the Japanese countryside."
01:21;01:25;"You got three guys in LA and we got Matt in Brooklyn."
01:25;01:27;"Oh, you're not still on Martha's Vineyard Jake?"
01:27;01:30;"No, I bounced. I bounced yesterday, flew back."
01:30;01:31;"Welcome back."
01:31;01:33;"Thank you. Feels great to be back."
01:33;01:35;"You're spiritually West Coast."
01:35;01:38;"Dipped through Boston very briefly because we flew out of Logan."
01:38;01:39;"Oh, how was that?"
01:39;01:43;"I haven't been there a long time. I'll keep it quick because we have a call that we have"
01:43;01:44;"to get to very quickly."
01:44;01:45;"Yes."
01:45;01:50;"We ate lunch at the Rock Bottom Brewery in Boston. Maybe we could circle back to that."
01:50;01:53;"I'd love to hear about the Rock Bottom Brewery."
01:53;01:54;"Let's just table that."
01:54;01:55;"Not at the airport?"
01:55;02:00;"No, no. It was in downtown Boston, which is even weirder. I would love to just walk you"
02:00;02:04;"through our whole two hour adventure in Boston."
02:04;02:05;"In real time."
02:05;02:06;"But we have two hours."
02:06;02:11;"Well, okay. Let's just scratch the itinerary for the show."
02:11;02:16;"Okay. But yeah, we're about to get a friend of the show, Alex Skordelis on to tell us"
02:16;02:23;"about how somehow time crisis figures into this NBA scandal, which I know very little"
02:23;02:24;"about."
02:24;02:25;"Boston Celtics actually."
02:25;02:28;"Oh, Boston Celtics. Right. Head coach being suspended."
02:28;02:33;"Yeah. When I was in Martha's Vineyard, I got a bunch of texts from Alex. He's basically"
02:33;02:37;"like, ""Has this crossed your desk? The head coach has been suspended for a year. The story"
02:37;02:43;"broke on Twitter about an hour before it did officially from this obscure account that"
02:43;02:48;"only follows 34 people."" And they couldn't figure out who this person was that broke"
02:48;02:54;"the story early. And they follow 34 people and they follow me, you, Seinfeld, and the"
02:54;03:00;"official time crisis account. Sorry, Nick. I don't think you were in the mix on this"
03:00;03:01;"one, but you will be shortly."
03:01;03:07;"I better be. You know, I'm still... Pumpkin Spice Latte official account still won't accept"
03:07;03:12;"my... I don't even know what you call it. My submission to follow them? My request to"
03:12;03:13;"follow them?"
03:13;03:20;"Yeah. That's horse crap. But anyway, so there's some deep secret TC head that broke this."
03:20;03:24;"That's also very connected to the Celtics organization."
03:24;03:28;"We'll get Alex on the phone just to explain this to us. Yeah, because I remember I was"
03:28;03:33;"waking up in Japan, seeing a bunch of texts about the economic heads or tails of it. And"
03:33;03:37;"I didn't even put it together later that the coach, I guess there's this whole other element"
03:37;03:40;"that he was married to the famous actress, Nia Long."
03:40;03:42;"Okay, news to me."
03:42;03:44;"So we're never getting her on Time Crisis now."
03:44;03:47;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis hotline."
03:47;03:49;"Hey, guys."
03:49;03:50;"Hey."
03:50;03:55;"What's up, Alex? Welcome back to the show."
03:55;03:56;"Thank you for having me back."
03:56;04:01;"I was just trying to catch the boys up on this whole backstory of you texting me of"
04:01;04:06;"all this, you know, has this crossed your desk yet? Do you know what's going on?"
04:06;04:09;"Let me just try to summarize quickly. You just tell me if this is right. Head coach"
04:09;04:16;"of the Celtics suspended for having an inappropriate relationship, affair, something with somebody"
04:16;04:22;"who worked at the organization. He suspended on top of that. He's married to the actress"
04:22;04:29;"Nia Long. So there's this whole other element of people being dismayed that he would violate"
04:29;04:32;"the sanctity of their marriage. So this is a big news story because the Celtics are a"
04:32;04:39;"major organization in the National Basketball Association. So he's a famous coach. If you"
04:39;04:40;"follow basketball, this guy's famous."
04:40;04:45;"Extremely. Yeah, he was. I mean, he was the first year coach last year at Udoka, but took"
04:45;04:50;"the Celtics to the finals in his first season as a coach, which was incredible."
04:50;04:52;"Oh, so this is bad timing for Boston."
04:52;04:57;"Yeah. Boston's got a young team. They've got this hot coach who's in his first season,"
04:57;05:02;"almost took them to win the title. And then the scandal, it blows up and breaks up the"
05:02;05:05;"team a little bit or sets the team back for sure."
05:05;05:10;"Oh, dear. OK, so now I understand the magnitude of it because at first I was hearing like"
05:10;05:14;"coach of the Celtics suspended. You know, if you don't follow basketball that closely"
05:14;05:16;"at first, I was like, who gives a ****?"
05:16;05:20;"Yeah, the specifics of the allegations weren't what caught my interest. I mean, it is a one"
05:20;05:25;"year suspension, which is pretty unprecedented for a coach. And the details of the allegations,"
05:25;05:30;"they're not out there yet entirely. So people don't know what we're talking about."
05:30;05:36;"Yeah, yeah, exactly. But what caught my attention was the story obviously came out of nowhere."
05:36;05:42;"There's an ESPN reporter, Adrian Wojnarowski, who goes by Woj. His thing is that he drops"
05:42;05:49;"big NBA news stories on Twitter and those tweets are called Woj bombs. So, yeah, he"
05:49;05:55;"dropped a Woj bomb a week ago last Wednesday that this was happening. Twitter freaks out."
05:55;06:01;"But then people pointed to a tweet that predated the Woj bomb by one hour. A burner account"
06:01;06:04;"beat him to the story by one hour."
06:04;06:09;"Ah, OK. So I'm starting to understand this better. So not only was this a big story and"
06:09;06:13;"this burner account, because even something happening an hour early, sometimes you're"
06:13;06:18;"almost like, well, OK, maybe they read something somebody else didn't read. I don't know. But"
06:18;06:23;"now I understand that when Woj drops a Woj bomb. Yes. A big part of it is that he got"
06:23;06:30;"the story first. He always gets it first. So this is a really big deal that this burner"
06:30;06:33;"account beat the Woj bomb."
06:33;06:37;"It's historic. I mean, to beat Woj to a Woj bomb. I don't recall something like that happening."
06:37;06:43;"Someone getting scooped by a burner. And so immediately all the Boston sports world focuses"
06:43;06:48;"on this burner and starts throwing around guesses as to who this could be. Is it a member"
06:48;06:52;"of the Celtics who didn't like the coach? Is it somebody from an opposing team like"
06:52;06:56;"Kevin Durant plays on the Nets? He famously has a lot of burner accounts. So a lot of"
06:56;07:00;"people are like, is this Kevin Durant? Is this the spouse of somebody on the Celtics?"
07:00;07:06;"So there's all these wild guesses going around. And I think of myself as somewhat of an Internet"
07:06;07:10;"detective. So I'm like, I want to look into this. And this tweet that broke the story"
07:10;07:17;"is blowing up. And I go to look at the account and the burner account follows 34 people."
07:17;07:21;"So I'm like, oh, I can look at who they follow to get a better sense of who this is. Is it"
07:21;07:26;"KD? Is it a Celtics player? So I click on who this burner follows. And the first names"
07:26;07:28;"that pop up are @Dongstreath."
07:28;07:37;"This is for Canaic Time Crisis Seinfeld 2000 in winter. I was like, oh, in winter? The"
07:37;07:43;"burner is a deep TC head. I'm like, whoever is behind this is a TC head."
07:43;07:47;"Yet they don't follow me. Yeah, they will."
07:47;07:52;"They will. And so, yeah, I was, you know, to me, because everyone is guessing like,"
07:52;07:57;"yeah, is it somebody on the Celtics? And so it's like, clearly it's a TC head. I don't"
07:57;08:00;"know if there's an NBA player who listens to TC."
08:00;08:01;"Not that we know."
08:01;08:06;"There's no chance that it's someone who's separately a fan of Starbucking, painting."
08:06;08:09;"Wait, hold on. And Vampire Weekend."
08:09;08:15;"Wait, I just realized, I just realized who it is. It's Nick. That's why. Oh, damn. It"
08:15;08:16;"was you?"
08:16;08:17;"That's why Nick."
08:17;08:20;"The call was coming from inside the house."
08:20;08:26;"His name was Nick too. Oh, it was you. Now we know from a couple episodes ago that Nick"
08:26;08:30;"has is a deep state operative and he has a lot of connections in national security agencies."
08:30;08:35;"He used to work at the Pentagon. So, of course, he could beat a Woj bomb."
08:35;08:36;"Imagine."
08:36;08:39;"The one thing I never thought was to follow myself."
08:39;08:40;"Sorry."
08:40;08:44;"And that I was really undone because I just didn't think to follow myself."
08:44;08:47;"Oh, I love this. It's like Columbo."
08:47;08:48;"Oh, it's."
08:48;08:54;"Just one more thing. Why did that account not follow you, Mr. Weidenfeld?"
08:54;09:05;"Last night I met a woman. You recognize her name. Who in our conversation told me you"
09:05;09:14;"were her old flame. Well, I didn't want to listen, but as she told me more, I learned"
09:14;09:25;"more about you than I ever knew before. You're keeping too many secrets from me. But baby,"
09:25;09:36;"I'm wise too. You fool me like the others and I know what you'll do. You'll find yourself"
09:36;09:40;"a new love and give me a secret too."
09:40;09:45;"So in a way, as you look through all these people, the fact that there were four or five"
09:45;09:50;"TC related accounts, this actually might be the biggest clue for an Internet detective"
09:50;09:51;"out of all these accounts."
09:51;09:57;"It's a huge clue. And yeah, the other things somebody found, I can't verify this, but this"
09:57;10:03;"burner account posted a receipt to a donation to Nithya Raman, who's an L.A. politician."
10:03;10:07;"And so when people start to make very specific guesses as to who it could be, I don't want"
10:07;10:12;"to name names, but some of these people were friends of mine who were being guessed as"
10:12;10:15;"behind the burner account. And they were kind of freaked out by how much attention this"
10:15;10:16;"was getting."
10:16;10:20;"Sorry, what did the account actually tweet? They just said, big story about to drop."
10:20;10:25;"It was a kind of a cryptic tweet. It was, if there's one person who will never get fired"
10:25;10:30;"for sleeping around, it's M.A. Udoka. So they're accurate and that he didn't get fired. The"
10:30;10:36;"accusation was that he was sleeping around. So it was very cryptic, but like specific"
10:36;10:37;"at the same time."
10:37;10:42;"So that almost sounds insider-y because it would be one thing if somebody heard, oh,"
10:42;10:47;"the coach of the Celtics got in trouble. Then you could just tweet coach of the Celtics,"
10:47;10:51;"big story coming. They even knew that he wouldn't be fired. I guess that could be a guess, but"
10:51;10:55;"that almost sounds like somebody who was aware of the decision the organization made already."
10:55;10:56;"Right."
10:56;10:57;"Like kind of deep."
10:57;11:01;"Yeah, this is a TC head with top level Boston Celtics intel."
11:01;11:04;"Yeah, it's an accurate."
11:04;11:09;"This be a coincidence, like, like somebody just earnestly loves this coach and was just"
11:09;11:13;"like keeping praise on their integrity kind of thing."
11:13;11:19;"That thought did cross my mind. Is this coincidence that you would put like one hour before this"
11:19;11:20;"major story drops?"
11:20;11:23;"And also this account doesn't post much."
11:23;11:28;"Doesn't post that often. The previous tweet was something about Mitski and Weezer. So"
11:28;11:32;"that to me immediately ruled out like a Kevin Durant or a best Celtics player. So they seem"
11:32;11:37;"like they're interested in indie rock, rock and roll, basketball. They seem to be a fan"
11:37;11:41;"of the Denver Nuggets, interestingly. So there's a few clues out there."
11:41;11:45;"Are you sure that Kevin Durant is not a Mitski or Weezer fan?"
11:45;11:50;"He's very, no, actually, I stand corrected. I've seen Kevin Durant will practice like"
11:50;11:55;"wearing a Pearl Jam t-shirt or a Kurt Cobain t-shirt. So he's, he's into rock and roll"
11:55;11:58;"for sure. So it could be, I won't rule it out."
11:58;11:59;"He likes the Blue Album."
11:59;12:07;"Yeah, he tapped out after that. This account hasn't tweeted since they broke this story."
12:07;12:11;"So to me, like, obviously this person is a TC head. They're probably listening right"
12:11;12:17;"now. So to me, it's like just send up some kind of signal, like to confirm."
12:17;12:21;"So they're trying to, I mean, do you get the sense that it's important to them that they"
12:21;12:23;"maintain their secrecy?"
12:23;12:24;"Unclear."
12:24;12:27;"Are people still digging into trying to figure out who this person is or?"
12:27;12:31;"Well, yeah, maybe at this point they are just freaked out. You're saying your other friends"
12:31;12:36;"got freaked out. Maybe they don't want the whole, and also as I've put it together over"
12:36;12:42;"the weeks, this is, this story turned so big because obviously Boston fans are very passionate."
12:42;12:46;"Now you've given us some much needed context about why they're particularly passionate."
12:46;12:50;"They probably thought they were going to go to the, win the finals this year if they went"
12:50;12:57;"last year. But then on top of that, there's this, the amount of discussion about the other"
12:57;13:02;"side of it. Nia Long finding out that her husband was cheating on her in apparently"
13:02;13:09;"in real time. She found out as the story broke. That created a whole storm. There was a sitting"
13:09;13:14;"congressman from the Bronx, Jamal Bowman, tweeting his support for her and how they"
13:14;13:20;"should establish a national holiday to honor her. So this is, this story, I guess it really"
13:20;13:25;"had it all. So it is a big story. So I could imagine if there's just a humble TC head who"
13:25;13:31;"just, you know, maybe they're a hacker. They hacked into some of the Celtics emails or"
13:31;13:35;"something. They didn't mean for it to get this big. So they probably should lay low."
13:35;13:39;"Yeah. Like I said, they haven't tweeted since. You would think that if they were that freaked"
13:39;13:43;"by it, that you would delete the tweet or delete the account. They've left it up. Somebody"
13:43;13:47;"did some kind of reconnaissance and found out that this account before the tweet had"
13:47;13:51;"five followers and followed 34. Now I think they have over 2000 now."
13:51;13:57;"What? Wow. So who was like, how strange. And maybe it's not that deep. Maybe it really"
13:57;14:04;"is like, you know, within the Celtics organization, the day they're about to announce the suspension,"
14:04;14:09;"by that point you have to imagine at least like 20 or 30 people know about it. One of"
14:09;14:13;"them is on the phone that morning with his cousin saying, don't say anything, but pretty"
14:13;14:17;"soon they're going to announce that the coach is getting suspended and something like that."
14:17;14:21;"And then they're like, okay, to me, that's the most accurate theory. I feel like it's"
14:21;14:24;"a, cause this person has tweeted a lot about the Denver Nuggets. To me, I feel like it's"
14:24;14:29;"somebody in Denver who probably like has a cousin that works for the Celtics who sort"
14:29;14:33;"of let it slip. Like, Hey, the story is going to break. And this guy's like, I'm going to"
14:33;14:39;"drop this bomb on Twitter. Big TC head, big mountain bruise fan. TC head making waves."
14:39;14:43;"I wonder if this person came to the vampire weekend show at red rocks and saw us perform"
14:43;14:49;"mountain bruise. I'd bet money on it. That's what they should confirm or deny. If you saw"
14:49;14:54;"the performance that you were at, they might be one of those TC heads is not a VW fan,"
14:54;15:00;"right? Could be real deep as discussed. They exist."

15:56;16:01;"- So what's the fallout with this story now?"
16:01;16:03;"So who's going to be the coach now?"
16:03;16:05;"- They have an interim head coach announced."
16:05;16:07;"I think it was an assistant coach,"
16:07;16:08;"blanking on his name."
16:08;16:09;"They're kind of like, yeah,"
16:09;16:11;"not letting a lot more information out,"
16:11;16:14;"trying to let the story lose oxygen."
16:14;16:17;"But yeah, TC had really dropped the bomb."
16:17;16:19;"- Well, thanks for doing that,"
16:19;16:22;"or like getting that scoop for us, man."
16:22;16:23;"That was a-"
16:23;16:24;"- Yeah, no, I said to text Jake,"
16:24;16:25;"I'm like, are you aware of this?"
16:25;16:26;"I have a, you know, like,"
16:26;16:29;"I'm on text threads with friends who are NBA fans"
16:29;16:30;"and everyone's talking about it."
16:30;16:34;"- Wow. Anything else cool happening in the sports world?"
16:34;16:35;"- One more thing, yes."
16:35;16:37;"There is, there's one more thing"
16:37;16:39;"that I want to drop on you guys real quick,"
16:39;16:42;"which is that on Sunday night,"
16:42;16:46;"NBC aired a promo for next week's Sunday Night Game,"
16:46;16:48;"the Buccaneers versus the Chiefs."
16:48;16:51;"So it's Patrick Mahomes versus Tom Brady."
16:51;16:52;"- Major."
16:52;16:55;"- In the promo, they had Beck covering"
16:55;16:57;"Old Man by Neil Young."
16:57;16:58;"I'm in a Neil Young cover band,"
16:58;17:00;"so this caught my attention."
17:00;17:01;"It made sense to do Old Man"
17:01;17:04;"because it has the line in the song about being 24."
17:04;17:08;"And Brady and Mahomes each both won their first Super Bowl"
17:08;17:09;"when they were 24."
17:09;17:12;"Mahomes is still young, Brady's the old man."
17:12;17:13;"- Brady's the old man."
17:13;17:16;"So this is like Mahomes talking to Brady."
17:16;17:16;"- Yes."
17:16;17:17;"- Old man."
17:17;17:19;"- So Beck dropped it as a single"
17:19;17:21;"and it came out in the promo,"
17:21;17:22;"but as soon as it came out,"
17:22;17:26;"Neil Young posted on Instagram"
17:26;17:27;"a still from his music video,"
17:27;17:28;"This Note's For You,"
17:28;17:30;"where he's holding up the beer bottles"
17:30;17:31;"that's sponsored by no one."
17:31;17:33;"So he's throwing shade."
17:33;17:34;"- Love it."
17:34;17:35;"- Saying, you know, like, middle finger,"
17:35;17:38;"you guys are using my song as promo."
17:38;17:40;"I don't approve."
17:40;17:41;"But then--"
17:41;17:41;"- Neil's got to chill, man."
17:41;17:42;"- Back it up for a second."
17:42;17:47;"In 2021, he sold 50% of his catalog for $150 million."
17:47;17:48;"To me, it's like--"
17:48;17:49;"- You pay the piper, right."
17:49;17:51;"- Yeah, it's a you already,"
17:51;17:51;"you sold it off already,"
17:51;17:54;"you have no say anymore over how this is used."
17:54;17:55;"- I dig it."
17:55;17:57;"I like Neil going old school."
17:57;17:58;"He's a crotchety old dude."
17:58;18:00;"He's like, I'm a rock star."
18:00;18:05;"I don't chill for Coca-Cola and the NFL and Budweiser."
18:05;18:06;"I love that."
18:06;18:09;"- And let's not forget that Neil's Canadian."
18:09;18:10;"He likes Canadian football."
18:10;18:14;"What's the Canadian Super Bowl called again?"
18:14;18:14;"- The Grey Cup, I think."
18:14;18:16;"- The Grey Cup, yeah."
18:16;18:19;"- Yeah, I still have a good memory of watching that"
18:19;18:21;"with everybody on the,"
18:21;18:25;"I think we watched the 2019 Grey Cup on the bus,"
18:25;18:28;"the whole band, I was like, whoa, alternate universe."
18:28;18:31;"- Those CFL players, they have full-time jobs."
18:31;18:33;"They have other nine to fives."
18:33;18:35;"- I love it. - That's old school."
18:35;18:37;"- I know Neil can get behind that."
18:37;18:40;"- But yeah, I guess if you sell your catalog,"
18:40;18:42;"you kind of lose the right to complain."
18:42;18:43;"I don't know, I kind of like it."
18:43;18:46;"- Look, I don't find it coherent,"
18:46;18:47;"but I'm with you, Jake,"
18:47;18:52;"in that I support Neil's right as a legend--"
18:52;18:53;"- Well put."
18:53;18:55;"- As one of the GOATs to be a crotchety"
18:55;18:58;"incoherent old hippie rocker."
18:58;18:59;"Just like with the Joe Rogan thing,"
18:59;19:02;"I thought that did not totally make sense,"
19:02;19:06;"but I do support his right to be slightly incoherent"
19:06;19:09;"and angry and you know, that's cool."
19:09;19:12;"- You support his right to be old."
19:12;19:13;"- I support his right to be an old man."
19:13;19:16;"Wow, this is also very,"
19:16;19:18;"this is very Borghese and multi-layered too"
19:18;19:22;"with the young quarterback and the old quarterback"
19:22;19:25;"and the relatively much younger Beck"
19:25;19:27;"and the old Neil Young."
19:27;19:29;"Beck's gotta make a music video"
19:29;19:33;"that's just him doing yet another cover of old man"
19:33;19:35;"talking to Neil Young about how this made him feel."
19:35;19:37;"- I felt bad for Beck in all this."
19:37;19:39;"Like Beck just did a straightforward cover,"
19:39;19:41;"drops his cover and he all of a sudden"
19:41;19:42;"gets shaved to Neil Young."
19:42;19:44;"It's like Beck caught a stray in all this."
19:44;19:46;"- What was his angle though?"
19:46;19:47;"- I think a check."
19:47;19:48;"- Yeah."
19:48;19:50;"- Beck got a check and I don't know,"
19:50;19:53;"maybe he's a passionate football fan."
19:53;19:56;"- The Beck part was like the weirdest part of it for me."
19:56;19:58;"Like back in the NFL,"
19:58;20:03;"those are two American icons that do not blend."
20:03;20:06;"- They really should have gotten Greta Van Fleet."
20:06;20:07;"- Yeah."
20:07;20:08;"- That would have ruled because it's truly,"
20:08;20:12;"it's like the young Bucks keeping the flame of rock alive."
20:12;20:13;"I know you just would have killed it."
20:13;20:16;"Old man, live your life."
20:16;20:19;"Just like a heavy Led Zeppelin revival version."
20:19;20:20;"- I'm a lot like you."
20:20;20:22;"- I think this just smacks of like,"
20:22;20:26;"there's some Gen X,"
20:26;20:29;"Wyden Kennedy,"
20:29;20:29;"who just, you know,"
20:29;20:31;"exact who loves Beck."
20:31;20:34;"And he's just, Beck's like, okay."
20:34;20:37;"They're just like, you know what we could do for the football?"
20:37;20:38;"We could, you know, let's get Beck to do that."
20:38;20:40;"I mean, there's just no-"
20:40;20:42;"- I don't like the sincere singer songwriter"
20:42;20:44;"mode of Beck at all."
20:44;20:48;"I don't like it in the context of shilling for the NFL."
20:48;20:49;"- But he didn't write the song."
20:49;20:50;"- What are you doing, dude?"
20:50;20:52;"- You prefer Beck's more fun, ironic."
20:52;20:55;"But I can also see, let's say you're Beck."
20:55;20:57;"And as a professional musician, I can say,"
20:57;20:59;"sometimes you get all sorts of offers."
20:59;21:01;"Use your song this way, that way."
21:01;21:03;"At a certain point, it's like, you know,"
21:03;21:04;"you got to make some money."
21:04;21:07;"You say no to the things that are egregious."
21:07;21:10;"The rest of it, you know, is just showbiz."
21:10;21:12;"So I picture your Beck every once in a while,"
21:12;21:15;"somebody's like, hey Beck, you want,"
21:15;21:18;"somebody wants to use loser in this kind of derogatory way"
21:18;21:21;"to like, in a commercial to make fun of another brand."
21:21;21:23;"And Beck's like, no way, man."
21:23;21:24;"That's not what loser's all about."
21:24;21:26;"And they're, you know, you probably get some,"
21:26;21:27;"a hundred grand, you know,"
21:27;21:30;"you play at a Jared Kushner's birthday party."
21:30;21:32;"And Beck's like, nah, man, I'm not about that."
21:32;21:34;"Nah, I don't care how good the money is."
21:34;21:35;"All right."
21:35;21:37;"And then they're like, all right, Beck, we got one."
21:37;21:41;"This one, you're going to cover a very tasteful song"
21:41;21:43;"by beloved singer songwriter, Neil Young."
21:43;21:44;"So when Beck said first, he's thinking,"
21:44;21:46;"well, I guess Neil signed off on it,"
21:46;21:50;"which in a way he did by taking that big fat check."
21:50;21:52;"So Beck's thinking, all right, Neil signed off on it."
21:52;21:55;"He technically, and what's this all about?"
21:55;21:58;"He's like, well, actually it's for the NFL."
21:58;22:01;"Beck's like, I got no real problem with football."
22:01;22:03;"And then they say, and actually the reason they chose"
22:03;22:05;"this song is because it makes so much sense"
22:05;22:07;"because it's the young quarterback, 24 years old,"
22:07;22:08;"the old one, Tom Brady."
22:08;22:11;"And Beck's like, oh, this is, this is God's plan."
22:11;22:13;"This makes so much sense."
22:13;22:15;"This is not some weird stretch."
22:15;22:18;"This is not some misuse of one of my songs."
22:18;22:19;"Everything's lining up."
22:19;22:22;"And they say, you know what, and you know what else Beck?"
22:22;22:24;"The money's not bad."
22:24;22:25;"All right. I love that song."
22:25;22:26;"All I got to do is record a cover."
22:26;22:28;"- It's not great, but it's not bad."
22:28;22:29;"- It's not great, but it's not bad."
22:29;22:32;"- I like this idea that Jared Kushner wants Beck"
22:32;22:34;"to play loser at a birthday party."
22:34;22:37;"(laughing)"
22:37;22:39;"- I won't do it."
22:39;22:41;"So I just, yeah, I really feel for Beck in the sense"
22:41;22:43;"that he probably does ask all these questions"
22:43;22:45;"and it probably did seem like it all lined up"
22:45;22:48;"where Beck's like, it's football, American is apple pie."
22:48;22:49;"Neil signed off on it."
22:49;22:52;"It actually makes sense for once, you know?"
22:52;22:55;"- Do you think Neil can name one Beck song?"
22:55;22:58;"- Oh yeah. I've actually seen Neil and Beck play together."
22:58;23:00;"- Oh wow. Oh, another ring."
23:00;23:01;"- Where?"
23:01;23:03;"- I grew up in the Bay area and every October"
23:03;23:05;"I would go to the Bridge School benefit."
23:05;23:08;"And I think Beck played it a couple of times"
23:08;23:11;"and yeah, Neil would come out and play a song with Beck."
23:11;23:13;"- A Beck song?"
23:13;23:14;"- Usually a Neil song, I think."
23:14;23:15;"- Okay."
23:15;23:20;"My question today is, can Neil name one Beck song?"
23:20;23:21;"I'm going to guess no."
23:21;23:23;"- One time at the Bridge School benefit,"
23:23;23:25;"they had some banter and Beck said,"
23:25;23:27;"Neil, not to put you on the spot,"
23:27;23:29;"but could you name any of my songs?"
23:29;23:31;"It was a painful 10 minutes, but Neil got three."
23:34;23:38;"- Guys, I'm on the official NFL eShop"
23:38;23:43;"where they sell a Ed Sheeran starter jacket,"
23:43;23:46;"NFL starter jacket."
23:46;23:49;"So it is pretty sick."
23:49;23:52;"It looks like it's the Cowboys colors"
23:52;23:57;"and it just says, ""Sheeran 2021 NFL kickoff."""
23:57;24:00;"So they could have gone, that strikes me,"
24:00;24:02;"he strikes me as a fan of football."
24:02;24:04;"- They're casting a wide net there."
24:04;24:06;"- They needed an American to sing it."
24:06;24:08;"I think they should have gone with Greta Van Fleet"
24:08;24:11;"because if Neil Young hated on Greta Van Fleet,"
24:11;24:12;"they'd just be like, ""With all due respect, sir,"
24:12;24:14;"your time has passed."
24:14;24:15;"You've inspired us,"
24:15;24:17;"but we are the new generation of rock and roll."""
24:17;24:20;"All right, Alex, we got to let you go, dude."
24:20;24:22;"- Yeah, I got a bail."
24:22;24:23;"Thanks for having me."
24:23;24:24;"- All right, thanks for explaining that to us, Alex."
24:24;24:26;"- Of course, good talking to you guys."
24:26;24:26;"- Talk soon."
24:26;24:27;"Great reporting."
24:27;24:28;"- Thanks."
24:28;24:30;"- Great reporting, peace."

25:51;25:53;"'cause actually I had a thought saying it on air"
25:53;25:54;"just so you remember."
25:54;25:56;"We haven't had Bayo on the show in a while"
25:56;26:00;"and I'd love for him to come on the show soon"
26:00;26:04;"and talk about his cousin, Harrison Bader,"
26:04;26:05;"plays for the Yankees now."
26:05;26:07;"- Oh wow, he got traded?"
26:07;26:09;"- Yeah, I can't remember if we ever talked about this"
26:09;26:13;"but we'll go into detail hopefully with Chris."
26:13;26:15;"So Bayo has a little cousin named Harrison Bader."
26:15;26:19;"He grew up in the same town as Bayo in Westchester County."
26:19;26:21;"I must've met him very briefly"
26:21;26:24;"when he was like 13 or 14 years old"
26:24;26:28;"because he came and was in the Oxford Comma video."
26:28;26:29;"We had like a lot of our friends in it."
26:29;26:32;"It's a single shot video directed by Richard Ayoade"
26:32;26:36;"and there's a lot of people jumping out and random people"
26:36;26:38;"and like my sister's friend from college"
26:38;26:40;"who went on to be on that show, Pen15 is in it"
26:40;26:45;"and that guy Hamilton Morris who has that show about drugs."
26:45;26:46;"All these people just popping up."
26:46;26:48;"- Damn, a lot of heavyweights."
26:48;26:50;"- Yeah, people pop, I didn't really know these people"
26:50;26:52;"but you know, just like we asked friends and family,"
26:52;26:53;"you got some friends, everybody come through"
26:53;26:55;"and dressed up, it's a fun video."
26:55;26:58;"And at the end, there's like a bunch of kids running,"
26:58;27:00;"little kids, some older kids."
27:00;27:02;"And so, you know, we're in upstate New York"
27:02;27:03;"so of course Bayo said,"
27:03;27:05;"""Oh, maybe like some of my little cousins can come."""
27:05;27:08;"So Harrison is in that video somewhere"
27:08;27:10;"and then a few years ago,"
27:10;27:11;"Bayo was saying that his cousin is playing"
27:11;27:13;"for the St. Louis Cardinals."
27:13;27:14;"- I remember that."
27:14;27:16;"- You know, we were on tour during the season"
27:16;27:19;"so there's a lot of like, he's watching the games"
27:19;27:20;"and keeping us in the loop about it."
27:20;27:23;"And we've even happened to play in St. Louis on that tour"
27:23;27:28;"and Bayo wore a Bader St. Louis Cards jersey on stage."
27:28;27:31;"So, you know, I've been like pretty aware of it."
27:31;27:33;"So I was already like, ""Oh, that's awesome."""
27:33;27:34;"Always kind of curious,"
27:34;27:36;"even though I don't particularly follow baseball,"
27:36;27:37;"curious to hear from Chris."
27:37;27:38;"""Oh, how's your cousin doing?"""
27:38;27:39;"All that stuff."
27:39;27:42;"And then anyway, he got traded to the Yankees"
27:42;27:46;"a couple months ago and Bayo will loop us in more"
27:46;27:49;"but I know his first game was a week or two ago,"
27:49;27:50;"we were texting about it"
27:50;27:53;"and you know, you can imagine that for a guy"
27:53;27:57;"grew up Westchester County, Stone's Throat from the Bronx,"
27:57;28:00;"real kind of like New York kid,"
28:00;28:04;"like his mom is Bayo's aunt, grew up in Brooklyn."
28:04;28:07;"I assume his dad's a New Yorker guy."
28:07;28:10;"He's like part Jewish, part Italian,"
28:10;28:12;"real East Coast type dude."
28:12;28:15;"And then you end up on the Yankees, the magnitude of that."
28:15;28:17;"- And the Yankees are good this year."
28:17;28:18;"- Yeah, I've been hearing that."
28:18;28:20;"And they have this guy,"
28:20;28:22;"the guy breaking the home run record."
28:22;28:23;"- Aaron Judge."
28:23;28:24;"- It's major."
28:24;28:26;"Anyway, we should have Bayo on to tell us more about it"
28:26;28:30;"but I just wanted to end our sports roundup"
28:30;28:32;"with a little bit of that."
28:32;28:34;"I might have to follow, really start following the Yankees"
28:34;28:36;"'cause you know, I feel like with a lot of sports,"
28:36;28:39;"I don't truly follow it but I do have these teams."
28:39;28:41;"It's like, if I'm gonna have a donut,"
28:41;28:42;"I'm gonna go to Dunkin' Donuts."
28:42;28:45;"If I'm gonna follow baseball,"
28:45;28:46;"I'm gonna support the Yankees."
28:46;28:48;"- Let's get in man, it's the very end of the season,"
28:48;28:50;"there's like a week left of the regular season"
28:50;28:51;"and then the playoffs start."
28:51;28:52;"- Wait, but Jake, I always forget,"
28:52;28:55;"were you a Yankees fan or a Mets fan?"
28:55;28:56;"You're a Yankees fan."
28:56;28:58;"- Diehard Yankees when they were terrible."
28:58;28:59;"- All right."
28:59;29:00;"- Late 80s, early 90s."
29:00;29:02;"They lost over 100 games in 1990."
29:02;29:04;"(laughing)"
29:04;29:05;"Mattingly had a back injury,"
29:05;29:07;"he was out for most of the year, it was heartbreaking."
29:07;29:08;"- All right, let's get in."
29:08;29:10;"- I'd love to talk about that"
29:10;29:12;"but let's get into some Allison Shane's talk."
29:12;29:14;"- All right, shifting gears."
29:14;29:15;"Shifting gears."
29:15;29:18;"- Well, I know we're on a tight schedule tonight."
29:18;29:19;"We're trying to get in and out."
29:19;29:21;"- I overbooked the show, my apologies."
29:21;29:23;"- Jake did a great job booking the show."
29:23;29:25;"- We got a hard out for you"
29:25;29:28;"and we got three different calls to do."
29:28;29:31;"- That's right, I'm on vacation in the Japanese countryside."
29:31;29:33;"Oh, but real quick, before Allison Shane's,"
29:33;29:35;"I just have to say, I ate horse yesterday."
29:35;29:38;"(gunshot)"
29:38;29:40;"I ate horse sashimi yesterday."
29:40;29:42;"We went to a restaurant that has like some type"
29:42;29:45;"of kind of regional big udon noodles"
29:45;29:47;"and get a big bowl of that."
29:47;29:49;"And they had horse sashimi on the menu."
29:49;29:51;"I thought, all right, got to try it."
29:51;29:53;"It came out very cold."
29:53;29:55;"I talked to a person I was with"
29:55;29:56;"who actually lives in Japan"
29:56;29:58;"and I was like, ""It's supposed to be this cold."""
29:58;29:59;"And they were kind of like, ""I don't know."
29:59;30:01;"""Have you let it chill out?"""
30:01;30:04;"It felt like almost like fresh out of the freezer."
30:04;30:06;"With the soy sauce and they had like some kind"
30:06;30:10;"of spicy things to mix it with, the sauce was excellent."
30:10;30:13;"Once it kind of got a little less cold,"
30:13;30:16;"it tasted very close to like a really dark,"
30:16;30:19;"rich tuna sashimi."
30:19;30:20;"It tasted good."
30:20;30:23;"Nobody else at the table wanted to partake,"
30:23;30:26;"but I did feel, I weirdly felt like I needed it."
30:26;30:28;"(horse neighing)"
30:28;30:30;"- When nobody wanted to partake, were they grossed out?"
30:30;30:35;"Did you feel shunned or was it just sort of a neutral?"
30:35;30:37;"None for me, thank you."
30:37;30:39;"- It was more like a none for me."
30:39;30:42;"Also, I'd ridden a horse earlier in the day."
30:42;30:45;"So there was a bit of like conversation about that."
30:45;30:48;"Full circle and I said, ""Yes, circle life is what it is."""
30:48;30:49;"People weren't grossed out."
30:49;30:50;"'Cause when I sent you guys a picture,"
30:50;30:52;"when you looked at it, truly,"
30:52;30:54;"if I told you that was salmon sashimi,"
30:54;30:58;"it's that same rich, kind of dark purplish red color."
30:58;30:58;"- Tuna, yeah."
30:59;31:02;"It doesn't look, there's nothing about it look gross."
31:02;31:03;"And I would say nothing about it tasted gross,"
31:03;31:05;"but I think people just felt a little bit like,"
31:05;31:09;"""Eh, they made it this far without eating horse."
31:09;31:11;"""Why start now?"""
31:11;31:12;"- I would think the opposite."
31:12;31:14;"- Yeah, that's true."
31:14;31:14;"- This is a coincidence,"
31:14;31:18;"you didn't seek out this restaurant because you heard it."
31:18;31:18;"- That was the thing."
31:18;31:21;"It was just, suddenly saw it on the menu"
31:21;31:23;"and felt like now's the time."
31:23;31:25;"♪ Well my heart knows it better than I know myself ♪"

32:18;32:20;"- So anyway, let's get back to Alice in Chains,"
32:20;32:22;"but I did feel like I just needed to..."
32:22;32:24;"- No, that's huge, that's a huge..."
32:24;32:25;"- There's a lot of..."
32:25;32:26;"- It's almost like a drop."
32:26;32:29;"- There's a lot of grade A reporting happening today"
32:29;32:30;"on the show, so..."
32:30;32:33;"- We got, Tom Chris has a lot of people in the field."
32:33;32:35;"We've got our hands deep into the sports world,"
32:35;32:37;"deep into the horse world,"
32:37;32:40;"and now deep into the Alice in Chains world."
32:40;32:44;"So Jake, it's the 30th anniversary of Dirt."
32:44;32:46;"- Yes, it's the 30th anniversary of Dirt."
32:46;32:49;"Tomorrow, 'cause we're taping this on the 28th."
32:49;32:53;"It came out on September 29th, 1992."
32:53;32:57;"And Dirt and Soundgarden's Bad Motorfinger"
32:57;33:00;"are my favorite grunge albums."
33:00;33:02;"- Whoa, more than any Nirvana albums?"
33:02;33:04;"- Somehow I don't really think of Nevermind"
33:04;33:05;"as a grunge album."
33:05;33:07;"Maybe that's ridiculous."
33:07;33:10;"But yeah, they're albums I spend more time with"
33:10;33:12;"than Nevermind, for sure."
33:12;33:15;"I return to Dirt and Bad Motorfinger"
33:15;33:17;"more than Nevermind."
33:17;33:18;"- Interesting."
33:18;33:18;"- I love Nevermind."
33:18;33:21;"I just feel like the weight of history"
33:21;33:22;"when I listen to Nevermind."
33:22;33:24;"It's kind of like listening to Sergeant Peppins"
33:24;33:25;"or something."
33:25;33:27;"- Right, rather than the White Album."
33:27;33:30;"- Exactly."
33:30;33:34;"But yeah, Dirt came out in '92, incredible record."
33:34;33:36;"And I wanted to have,"
33:36;33:37;"well, I've been on a text thread"
33:37;33:41;"for the last six months with Aaron Olson and Ryan Adlaff,"
33:41;33:44;"who are from Richard Pictures and Mountain Bruce,"
33:44;33:45;"and my brother, Dave."
33:45;33:48;"We have a four-person text about Alice in Chains."
33:48;33:51;"Because several years ago,"
33:51;33:55;"Aaron had a one-off Alice in Chains cover band"
33:55;33:57;"called Five Lane Blacktop,"
33:57;34:00;"where there were five different people who sang lead."
34:00;34:06;"And so, there was discussion of maybe resurrecting"
34:06;34:07;"that band for this Halloween."
34:07;34:09;"Although I said that I would just serve"
34:09;34:10;"in a management role."
34:10;34:13;"That I actually don't have the musical chops"
34:13;34:17;"to participate in a revival of Five Lane Blacktop."
34:17;34:19;"- Was Dave in Five Lane?"
34:19;34:21;"- No, Dave was not in the original Five Lane Blacktop,"
34:21;34:25;"but we did a hangout for my birthday earlier this year,"
34:25;34:27;"and there was kind of like an impromptu jam session"
34:27;34:32;"in my living room with a bunch of detuned acoustic guitars."
34:32;34:35;"Take that down to drop D, with Aaron and Ryan."
34:35;34:39;"And then Dave doing, Dave knows Dirt incredibly well."
34:39;34:41;"And he was gonna call in today, but he got tied up."
34:41;34:42;"He can't call in today."
34:42;34:45;"Dave knows every little vocal nuance"
34:45;34:48;"that Layne Staley performed on that record."
34:48;34:50;"- Major influence on Dirty Projectors."
34:50;34:52;"- I mean, in a way, in a roundabout way."
34:52;34:53;"- Not, not, not."
34:53;34:55;"- Not, not, exactly."
34:55;34:57;"But anyway, we were texting today and I was just like,"
34:57;34:59;"""Wow, let's just like have the guys call in"
34:59;35:01;"""and talk about Dirt a little bit."""
35:01;35:02;"- Absolutely."
35:02;35:03;"- Ezra, are you a fan of Dirt?"
35:03;35:06;"- You know, I don't know, is the truth."
35:06;35:08;"Like, when I think about Alice in Chains,"
35:08;35:11;"they always seemed a little random to me,"
35:11;35:15;"but I always did, you know, I liked Man in the Box,"
35:15;35:18;"Rooster, are any of these songs on Dirt?"
35:18;35:20;"- Rooster's on Dirt."
35:20;35:23;"Man in the Box was on their first record, Facelift."
35:23;35:24;"- You know, I don't know them well enough,"
35:24;35:27;"but I always thought Alice in Chains was interesting."
35:27;35:29;"I'm looking at the Japanese listing,"
35:29;35:32;"it might be the same as in the US,"
35:32;35:34;"but the description is for Dirt is,"
35:34;35:36;"""Alice in Chains were initially tagged"
35:36;35:38;"""with the grunge moniker, when in fact,"
35:38;35:41;"""their haunting, ponderous sound was far closer"
35:41;35:44;"""to the progressive rock of Queensryche."""
35:44;35:46;"Their haunting, ponderous sound."
35:46;35:47;"I don't know if anybody wants their music"
35:47;35:50;"to be described as ponderous, but I like that."
35:50;35:52;"And I like their general vibe."
35:52;35:56;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
35:56;35:58;"(phone ringing)"
35:58;36:00;"- Hey, Aaron."
36:00;36:01;"- Hey."
36:01;36:02;"- What's up?"
36:02;36:03;"Welcome to TC."
36:03;36:04;"Welcome back."
36:04;36:05;"- Thank you."
36:05;36:07;"- Happy 30th anniversary."
36:07;36:10;"- Thank you."
36:10;36:10;"Finally."
36:10;36:14;"- My first question for you and Jake is,"
36:14;36:17;"did you guys buy Dirt on release day?"
36:17;36:22;"So is this actually your 30th anniversary with this album?"
36:22;36:23;"- I'll go first, I guess."
36:23;36:26;"I was seven when it came out."
36:26;36:28;"I don't think I bought it the day it came out,"
36:28;36:32;"but I think I bought it within the year or two"
36:32;36:34;"that it came out, probably."
36:34;36:35;"- On cassette?"
36:35;36:37;"- It was an early CD for me."
36:37;36:40;"I was really anti-CD for a long time,"
36:40;36:44;"as like a little kid, 'cause I thought it was like lame"
36:44;36:46;"to be able to skip songs."
36:46;36:47;"- That tracks for you."
36:47;36:48;"- Yeah."
36:48;36:49;"(laughing)"
36:49;36:51;"- As a seven-year-old?"
36:51;36:52;"- Yeah, as a seven-year-old."
36:52;36:56;"I remember friends were getting CDs"
36:56;36:58;"and I was like, ""That's lame."""
36:58;36:59;"But, you know what I mean."
36:59;37:01;"(laughing)"
37:01;37:04;"Yeah, I probably picked it up in '93."
37:04;37:05;"- At age eight."
37:05;37:06;"- At age eight, yes."
37:06;37:08;"- At the tender age of eight."
37:08;37:09;"- Yes."
37:09;37:11;"- Hold on, Mac, let's just put on our calendar."
37:11;37:13;"We gotta have Aaron back next year"
37:13;37:17;"for his 30th anniversary of owning the CD of Dirt."
37:17;37:20;"Ryan, how about you?"
37:20;37:25;"- I got Dirt for Christmas in 1993 from my grandmother."
37:25;37:26;"- So the album had been out."
37:26;37:27;"Wow."
37:27;37:29;"(laughing)"
37:29;37:30;"Cool grandma."
37:30;37:31;"- You will, it's one of those things"
37:31;37:33;"where my mom would ask like,"
37:33;37:35;"""Ryan, your grandma needs to get you a Christmas gift."
37:35;37:35;"""What do you want?"""
37:35;37:38;"And I said, ""I want Blood Sugar Sex Magic"
37:38;37:39;"""and I want Alice in Chains Dirt."""
37:39;37:42;"And then my grandma had to like give those to me."
37:42;37:45;"But, you know, what is Alice in Chains Dirt?"
37:45;37:47;"I had to try to explain it, she didn't care."
37:47;37:48;"- Thanks, grandma."
37:48;37:49;"- Yeah, exactly."
37:49;37:51;"I love you, grandma."
37:51;37:52;"(laughing)"
37:52;37:57;"I had a cassette tape of it, which I probably got in '93."
37:57;37:59;"'Cause it, wait, yeah, 'cause it came out in the fall of '92."
37:59;38:03;"I bet the singles, you know, I wasn't up on AIC before Dirt."
38:03;38:05;"And the singles started rolling out."
38:05;38:08;"And yeah, at some point I purchased the cassette"
38:08;38:11;"at the Wall, which is the local kind of"
38:11;38:14;"New England record store chain"
38:14;38:16;"that was in the shopping center near my house."
38:16;38:18;"- All right, so you were a bit older, Jake."
38:18;38:19;"You were like, you were 14."
38:19;38:21;"- Well, Ryan and I are 10 days apart."
38:21;38:23;"We're both February of '77."
38:23;38:26;"So we were the right age."
38:26;38:27;"- Yeah, wheelhouse."
38:27;38:30;"- What'd you guys think of that haunting ponderous sound?"
38:30;38:31;"(laughing)"
38:31;38:32;"- I loved it."
38:32;38:35;"- But Aaron, you as a small child,"
38:35;38:38;"you were ready for the haunting ponderous sound of..."
38:38;38:41;"- Yeah, I was so, so down."
38:41;38:44;"I have an older brother, three years older."
38:44;38:47;"So he was, you know, I was getting stuff"
38:47;38:49;"funneling from him."
38:49;38:50;"- So he was 11."
38:50;38:54;"- Yeah, I mean, I don't think, we were,"
38:54;38:57;"and still are, like, really into music, I guess."
38:57;39:01;"Like, yeah, my mom always had music on."
39:01;39:04;"Or I don't know, there's just, that's like all I knew."
39:04;39:06;"- But an 11-year-old saying to an eight-year-old,"
39:06;39:09;"like, dude, check out this song, ""Junkhead."""
39:09;39:10;"(laughing)"
39:10;39:12;"- Well, okay, so that's the thing is,"
39:12;39:14;"my brother did like Alice in Chains,"
39:14;39:16;"but you know when you're, maybe again,"
39:16;39:19;"maybe this is me and my weird, like,"
39:19;39:22;"fanaticism as a kid or whatever,"
39:22;39:25;"but Alice in Chains was like my band,"
39:25;39:26;"away from my brother."
39:26;39:28;"Like, I think he kind of liked it,"
39:28;39:30;"and then I like latched on, and I was like,"
39:30;39:32;"I'm the Alice in Chains guy."
39:32;39:34;"And like, you know, you really ride hard"
39:34;39:36;"for specific things when you're a little kid,"
39:36;39:38;"I find, or I found in my life."
39:38;39:40;"- And especially in that era,"
39:40;39:41;"where it'd be such a big deal to like,"
39:41;39:44;"invest in a t-shirt or a poster."
39:44;39:46;"- Which I had two of."
39:46;39:47;"- Even the CDs were expensive,"
39:47;39:48;"so it's like, if you're gonna start"
39:48;39:50;"buying someone's discography,"
39:50;39:52;"you kinda gotta be all in."
39:52;39:55;"- Yeah, and yeah, I had two Alice in Chains posters"
39:55;39:58;"next to each other on my wall in my bedroom"
39:58;39:59;"when I was a kid."
39:59;40:00;"- See, this is fascinating to me,"
40:00;40:03;"'cause I don't know if I could even cobble together"
40:03;40:07;"a text thread of other people I know in my life"
40:07;40:09;"who are passionate about Alice in Chains,"
40:09;40:12;"or even know the album Dirt particularly well."
40:12;40:14;"So I always thought Alice in Chains"
40:14;40:15;"seemed like pretty cool."
40:15;40:17;"Explain to me a little bit,"
40:17;40:21;"in the early '90s rock universe,"
40:21;40:23;"so maybe on one side of the spectrum,"
40:23;40:25;"you know, you had Metallica,"
40:25;40:27;"like just like a straight up metal band"
40:27;40:31;"full of darkness, Black Album came out '91,"
40:31;40:33;"that still was looming large around this time."
40:33;40:34;"So you have that side,"
40:34;40:35;"and then of course you have Pantera,"
40:35;40:37;"just like heavy, heavy music."
40:37;40:38;"And then in the middle you have Grunge,"
40:38;40:41;"you have Nirvana, and Pearl Jam,"
40:41;40:43;"who maybe come across a bit punkier"
40:43;40:45;"than the Alice in Chains and the Soundguards,"
40:45;40:48;"and then you have like maybe the Chili Peppers"
40:48;40:50;"or something, a bit more of a sense of humor, fun."
40:50;40:55;"What was Alice in Chains' lane in that landscape?"
40:55;40:57;"- Staley."
40:57;40:59;"- I love the way you phrased that question."
40:59;41:02;"- Yes, I really teed that one up."
41:02;41:06;"So their lane was Lane Staley, their singer."
41:06;41:07;"- For me it was like,"
41:07;41:12;"they had a very, very distinct, perfect ratio"
41:12;41:15;"between like metal, which I'm not a fan of,"
41:15;41:18;"hard rock, which I'm also not a fan of."
41:18;41:20;"And then I don't want to say pop,"
41:20;41:22;"'cause that's not the right word,"
41:22;41:27;"but some sort of like major key, melodic, sugary rock."
41:27;41:31;"And like, there was like such a perfect mix with that,"
41:31;41:34;"where there'd be like this kind of sugar rush release"
41:34;41:37;"on some of their great songs and the choruses,"
41:37;41:38;"but they really worked for it."
41:38;41:40;"So it didn't come off as like kind of too sweet,"
41:40;41:42;"too saccharine."
41:42;41:44;"That tracks."
41:44;41:45;"- I think it's the harmonies."
41:45;41:47;"I think it's the harmonies really is the gateway."
41:47;41:48;"If you're not a hard rock person,"
41:48;41:51;"the harmonies are so sweet and clear and smooth."
41:51;41:52;"And they don't feel like metal."
41:52;41:54;"They feel more like, I don't know,"
41:54;41:56;"a Crosby, Stills and Nash."
41:56;41:57;"- And like, why?"
41:57;42:00;"'Cause they have multi-part harmonies sometimes?"
42:00;42:02;"Did any of their, like how often was that happening?"
42:02;42:04;"- It was pretty distinct, I think."
42:04;42:06;"- Oh yeah, it was very, it was like their signature."
42:06;42:09;"And I'd extend that to the guitars too."
42:09;42:11;"They had some guitar harmony stuff happening,"
42:11;42:12;"which wasn't as unique,"
42:12;42:16;"but it really mimics the vocal harmonies, I thought."
42:16;42:17;"And like, I don't know,"
42:17;42:20;"it was very harmonically rich music,"
42:20;42:22;"I would say in general."
42:22;42:23;"- Interesting."
42:23;42:24;"What do you guys think are"
42:24;42:27;"Alice in Chains influences or origins?"
42:27;42:29;"Am I right to say that they seem like guys"
42:29;42:31;"who maybe didn't give a about punk rock?"
42:31;42:32;"That's interesting."
42:32;42:35;"- I don't, I wouldn't think that."
42:35;42:36;"- We've talked about this on the show before,"
42:36;42:38;"when everybody would talk about,"
42:38;42:38;"we're the same age, Aaron,"
42:38;42:40;"just like, you know, maybe you could see it"
42:40;42:42;"step in my shoes, growing up in the nineties,"
42:42;42:44;"I wasn't that passionate about grunge,"
42:44;42:45;"but then I got really into punk,"
42:45;42:47;"including like the whole history of punk."
42:47;42:48;"And then people are like, well, you know,"
42:48;42:50;"grunge is kind of like, you know,"
42:50;42:51;"91 is the year punk broke."
42:51;42:53;"And I would like listen to the grunge bands."
42:53;42:54;"I'd be like, what?"
42:54;42:55;"I couldn't see the,"
42:55;42:57;"because I was like so interested in the Clash"
42:57;43:00;"and the Ramones and even like Operation Ivy"
43:00;43:01;"and like local pop punk."
43:01;43:03;"And I couldn't see the connection,"
43:03;43:04;"but then I was like, okay,"
43:04;43:07;"I can see Kurt Cobain kind of being like a dude"
43:07;43:10;"with a punk rock spirit that he's bringing into his music."
43:10;43:12;"And then when I kind of found out, okay,"
43:12;43:14;"Eddie Vedder grew up loving punk rock,"
43:14;43:15;"I can kind of see it."
43:15;43:17;"By the time I got to Alice in Chains and Soundgarden,"
43:17;43:20;"I was like, punk could not have happened."
43:20;43:22;"And this still, music would still be a,"
43:22;43:25;"make sense coming out of the history of rock and roll."
43:25;43:26;"- That's interesting."
43:26;43:29;"I mean, I think it's there in sort of a backdoor way,"
43:29;43:30;"but yeah, I see what you're saying."
43:30;43:33;"I mean, to me, there is like a direct lineage"
43:33;43:36;"from like Sabbath and Zeppelin."
43:36;43:38;"- With those harmonies, which those bands have."
43:38;43:40;"- Eagles are in there too, man."
43:40;43:41;"- Yeah, totally."
43:41;43:42;"- Eagles, CSNY."
43:42;43:43;"- Yeah."
43:43;43:44;"- Well, yeah."
43:44;43:44;"- Totally."
43:44;43:48;"- I think that Alice in Chains getting lumped in as grunge"
43:48;43:51;"is, I mean, did them a lot of favors."
43:51;43:53;"It put them across my seven-year-old desk,"
43:53;43:55;"but I don't think they're a grunge band."
43:55;43:58;"I think if you listen to Dirt next to the Black Album,"
43:58;44:02;"it's just as metal as the Black Album is."
44:02;44:07;"And it's so just dour and bleak lyrically"
44:07;44:09;"that it's its own thing."
44:09;44:11;"- The lyrics go so much harder than Metallica."
44:11;44:13;"I mean, I like Metallica,"
44:13;44:16;"but like the lyrics in Metallica"
44:16;44:18;"are generally pretty terrible."
44:18;44:19;"- They write songs about werewolves."
44:19;44:20;"- Yeah."
44:20;44:23;"- Alice in Chains writes songs about real problems."
44:23;44:24;"- Wait, hold on a second."
44:24;44:25;"I don't really know what I'm talking about,"
44:25;44:29;"but like I know Alice in Chains, Rooster's about Vietnam."
44:29;44:32;"Couldn't you put that next to like one song"
44:32;44:33;"about the horrors of war?"
44:33;44:36;"- Rooster's about Jerry Cantrell's dad,"
44:36;44:37;"whose nickname was the Rooster."
44:37;44:38;"- Ah."
44:38;44:41;"- And who he was estranged from."
44:41;44:42;"And then like half the album is about like-"
44:42;44:43;"- More personal."
44:43;44:45;"- Half the album is basically about heroin,"
44:45;44:47;"like doing heroin."
44:47;44:47;"- Definitely."
44:47;44:48;"- And like being tor-"
44:48;44:50;"Not in like, and I was reading some stuff today"
44:50;44:52;"about how like Layne Staley was saying"
44:52;44:54;"how like fans would come up to him and be like,"
44:54;44:56;"""Yo, dude, I'm like messed up right now."""
44:56;44:58;"And Layne was like, ""I'm sorry."""
44:58;44:59;"Like, that's not,"
44:59;45:01;"this is not meant to celebrate doing heroin."
45:01;45:03;"This is, these songs are about like"
45:03;45:06;"the torment I feel that I'm an addict."
45:06;45:08;"But like anything where like"
45:08;45:10;"an artist takes troubling subject matter"
45:10;45:14;"and makes it aesthetic and makes it like exciting,"
45:14;45:15;"people kind of misinterpret."
45:15;45:18;"Like people would think Tony Soprano's a cool guy."
45:18;45:20;"It's a little bit like people,"
45:20;45:22;"I think a lot of, or at least according to Layne Staley,"
45:22;45:25;"people seem to like think that Dirt was a glorification"
45:25;45:27;"of like shooting heroin."
45:27;45:28;"- Well, it's like they say,"
45:28;45:32;"you can't make an anti-war war movie, right?"
45:32;45:35;"'Cause it's, it instantly is like glorifying it"
45:35;45:35;"or whatever."
45:35;45:36;"And it's kind of, I think it's kind of the same"
45:36;45:38;"with drug songs."
45:38;45:40;"- And this, these songs go hard."
45:40;45:41;"- They are dark."
45:41;45:42;"They're really dark."
45:42;45:44;"Like they're, they don't, if you listen to the lyrics,"
45:44;45:46;"it doesn't sound fun to do heroin."

47:28;47:30;"His addiction and his problems made it"
47:30;47:33;"so he couldn't be in the band relatively soon after this."
47:33;47:35;"And then obviously he died."
47:35;47:39;"When was the original first classic"
47:39;47:41;"Alice in Chains era over by?"
47:41;47:42;"- Like Dirt, basically."
47:42;47:44;"- Well, there was one more studio record."
47:44;47:47;"The self-titled from like '94, '95."
47:47;47:49;"- I know, but it was, so by '96,"
47:49;47:51;"he was having so many problems he couldn't--"
47:51;47:52;"- That's when they did Unplugged."
47:52;47:55;"And he's like half asleep the whole time,"
47:55;47:57;"probably nodding off, I mean, yeah."
47:57;47:59;"- So he was in bad shape by '96."
47:59;48:00;"And when did he die?"
48:00;48:02;"- 2002 or--"
48:02;48:03;"- Yeah, '02."
48:03;48:06;"Right, so between '96 and '02,"
48:06;48:08;"he was estranged from the band"
48:08;48:11;"and probably living a difficult life,"
48:11;48:13;"struggling with addiction."
48:13;48:14;"So when you think about it,"
48:14;48:16;"he was having big problems even as this album was made"
48:16;48:20;"and the life of the band did not extend too much past this."
48:20;48:22;"- No, this was undoubtedly the peak."
48:22;48:24;"- Right, heavy."
48:24;48:26;"- A short trajectory for the band."
48:26;48:28;"- What are the best songs on Dirt?"
48:28;48:30;"Everybody's got to pick one favorite."
48:30;48:31;"How about that?"
48:31;48:34;"Everybody on the AIC text group chat."
48:34;48:37;"- Okay, Aaron, what are your three?"
48:37;48:38;"- I can get it down to three."
48:38;48:40;"""Rain When I Die,"" which my wife,"
48:40;48:42;"we were just listening to it, was like,"
48:42;48:44;"I think I actually like this song."
48:44;48:45;"And I was like, yeah."
48:45;48:46;"- That's incredible."
48:46;48:48;"- And ""Junkhead."""
48:48;48:52;"And I'll just leave it at those two, actually."
48:52;48:53;"Keep it with two."
48:53;48:54;"- Ryan?"
48:54;48:57;"- Oh wait, actually, ""Damn That River,"" sorry."
48:57;48:59;"- ""Damn That River"" goes hard."
48:59;48:59;"- Yeah."
48:59;49:02;"- I'm gonna jump on ""Wood"" before anybody else takes it."
49:02;49:04;"The single soundtrack, that song was really,"
49:04;49:06;"it really jumped out for me."
49:06;49:07;"- Incredible."
49:07;49:08;"- Jake?"
49:08;49:12;"- I'm gonna go album opener, ""Them Bones."""
49:12;49:14;"Just like that opening with him going, ""Ah!"""
49:14;49:15;"(laughing)"
49:15;49:17;"In that weird time signature."
49:17;49:21;"- Because that's track one, throw that on for a second."
49:21;49:21;"- Throw on ""Wood."""
49:21;49:22;"I mean, ""Them Bones."""
49:22;49:23;"- Can I wait, before you start it,"
49:23;49:25;"can I just say, I was just talking"
49:25;49:30;"with our mutual friend, Nick Kurgovich, about ""Dirt."""
49:30;49:32;"And he said when he bought this album when it came out,"
49:32;49:35;"because he bought it 'cause he had the single soundtrack,"
49:35;49:38;"like ""Wood,"" that he put this on"
49:38;49:40;"and he actually had a jump scare."
49:40;49:43;"And he vividly remembers it, that it frightened him."
49:43;49:46;"- The beginning of this record is a perfect,"
49:46;49:48;"it's the perfect start to this record."
49:48;49:51;"- Everybody listening, it's 1992."

50:40;50:42;"And I don't know, I'm ashamed to say,"
50:42;50:44;"I may have never even heard this song,"
50:44;50:48;"and yet having a vague, just like '90s kid familiarity"
50:48;50:50;"with Alice in Chains, I know these harmonies."
50:50;50:53;"I know this vibe so well."
50:53;50:55;"- I feel like they use very distinct intervals."
50:55;50:57;"I don't know what they are, but they have a very distinct--"
50:57;50:59;"- Yeah, it's kind of like vocal--"
50:59;51:02;"- It's in weird medieval (beep)"
51:02;51:03;"- Yeah."
51:03;51:06;"- There's a lot of harmonies that are kind of"
51:06;51:09;"totally different melodic lines from each other."
51:09;51:11;"Like they're not always in--"
51:11;51:12;"- Like counterpoint?"
51:12;51:13;"- Yeah, kind of, yeah."
51:13;51:14;"They're not crossing over."
51:14;51:16;"Yeah, it's counterpoint."
51:16;51:20;"They're not parallel or in similar motion always."
51:20;51:23;"(upbeat rock music)"
51:23;51:29;"I love this solo too, by the way."
51:29;51:30;"- Yeah."
51:30;51:33;"But I feel like the verse is in like a weird time signature,"
51:33;51:35;"and then the chorus, they go into like straight 4/4."
51:35;51:37;"And it's like, that's kind of what I'm talking about."
51:37;51:40;"That like sugary kind of release."
51:40;51:41;"- Yeah."
51:41;51:43;"- I mean, the choruses in this band are so amazing."
51:43;51:46;"Like I said, I don't like metal really,"
51:46;51:49;"and I'm not a huge fan of hard rock,"
51:49;51:51;"which is a broad genre admittedly."
51:51;51:56;"But I love this band, and it's because of like those choruses."
51:56;51:59;"- It's, God, one of the like least accessible songs"
51:59;52:02;"on the album has one of the poppiest choruses."
52:02;52:04;"It's like basically a Weezer chorus or something,"
52:04;52:05;"but it's-"
52:05;52:06;"- Oh, ""Angry Chair""?"
52:06;52:08;"- Yeah, it's ""Angry Chair."""
52:08;52:10;"Yeah, I don't mind that one."
52:10;52:13;"- Throw in ""Down in a Hole."""
52:13;52:16;"You can go out on ""Down in a Hole."""
52:16;52:17;"- This is the single, right?"
52:17;52:18;"""Down in a Hole."""
52:18;52:19;"- Yeah, this was like a ballad,"
52:19;52:21;"but this was my other favorite."
52:21;52:24;"- I have nothing to confirm this,"
52:24;52:27;"but I think that Jerry Cantrell"
52:27;52:30;"must've grown up listening to Boston."
52:30;52:31;"- Yes."
52:31;52:34;"- And this, like the guitar. - Very true."
52:34;52:36;"- Think of this song as a Boston song."
52:36;52:38;"- Absolutely, great call."
52:38;52:39;"- Oh, totally."
52:39;52:44;"This is funny too, because they famously say"
52:44;52:48;"that Kurt was inspired by Boston more than a feeling"
52:48;52:50;"for ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."""
52:50;52:51;"- Funny."
52:51;52:52;"- ""Godfather's a Grunge."""
52:52;52:53;"- Yeah, man."
52:53;52:57;"- How is ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" related to?"
52:57;53:00;"- Well, just like, (imitates guitar)"

53:59;54:01;"We went to the Goose Show with him."

54:06;54:08;"that just came out this week."
54:08;54:10;"- One thing I wanna ask Stephen about is,"
54:10;54:11;"in the Pearl Jam book,"
54:11;54:15;"he talks quite a bit about Stone Temple Pilots,"
54:15;54:17;"who he likes and has a lot of compassion for."
54:17;54:19;"And it's funny, listening to Alice in Chains,"
54:19;54:21;"'cause people always said Stone Temple Pilots"
54:21;54:23;"were a Pearl Jam ripoff,"
54:23;54:26;"I weirdly hear more Alice in Chains."
54:26;54:28;"And of course, they were doing their own thing."
54:28;54:31;"- Wait, you mean you hear Pearl Jam in Alice in Chains,"
54:31;54:32;"or you hear Alice in Chains in Pearl Jam?"
54:32;54:37;"- I hear more Alice in Chains in STP than I do Pearl Jam."
54:37;54:38;"- Oh, interesting. - Yes, absolutely."
54:38;54:41;"- Especially when we were listening to Them Bones,"
54:41;54:44;"I was like, okay, I could see Stone Temple Pilots"
54:44;54:46;"take a lot of inspiration from the dynamics"
54:46;54:47;"and the chords of that song."
54:47;54:49;"- Think about this song,"
54:49;54:52;"and then Stone Temple Pilots' song ""Creep."""
54:52;54:53;"- Yeah."
54:53;54:55;"- Half the man I used to be."
54:55;54:57;"- Yeah. - Oh, yeah, yeah, totally."
54:57;55:02;"'Cause even lyrically, the Scott Weiland archetype"
55:02;55:05;"is more similar to Layne Staley than it is to Eddie Vedder."
55:05;55:09;"- And I feel like Cantrell and the DeLeo brothers"
55:09;55:13;"are more Zeppelin heads than Mike McReady."
55:13;55:16;"Mike McReady to me is straight Lynyrd Skynyrd."
55:16;55:18;"He doesn't have the sophistication of Page."
55:18;55:20;"- Jake has no respect for Mike. - I hate McReady."
55:20;55:22;"I have zero patience for him."
55:22;55:25;"But he doesn't have the sophistication of Page."
55:25;55:28;"But I feel like Cantrell and the DeLeo brothers,"
55:28;55:33;"they tap into that like houses of the holy era Zeppelin energy"
55:33;55:38;"which Pearl Jam never touched to their detriment."
55:38;55:43;"- Also, there's something else that STP and Chains"
55:43;55:45;"have in common, and that's, it's a minor thing,"
55:45;55:48;"but there's like this, I don't even know what you'd call it,"
55:48;55:50;"I guess like turns of phrase"
55:50;55:53;"that are very working man things."
55:53;55:56;"There's an Allison Chain song where he says,"
55:56;56:01;"like never wanted to end up like my old man or something."
56:01;56:04;"That's very like 70s, like, oh man, I'm working for county,"
56:04;56:06;"gonna end up like my old man."
56:06;56:10;"And then STP is like all I got is time."
56:10;56:14;"I don't know, there's like this weird,"
56:14;56:16;"I feel like it's something very 70s"
56:16;56:18;"working class thing or something."
56:18;56:22;"I don't know where it's coming from or what it's doing,"
56:22;56:24;"but I remember it distinctly as a kid"
56:24;56:28;"and thinking it was very cool to talk like that."
56:28;56:31;"Talking about my old man and like all I got is like"
56:31;56:32;"five bucks, man."
56:32;56:33;"- Right."
56:33;56:35;"- Or I says to the guys, yeah, I don't know."
56:35;56:38;"- Kurt would never, Eddie probably not."
56:38;56:41;"(rock music)"
56:41;56:50;"It's very interesting to think of them"
56:50;56:53;"as being kind of like the 90s CSNY."
56:53;56:55;"Just to break it down, you guys have been talking"
56:55;56:56;"about everybody in the band so far,"
56:56;56:59;"but just for me and the listeners."
56:59;57:03;"So you had Layne Staley, the brilliant but doomed singer."
57:03;57:06;"Jerry Cantrell was the lead guitarist"
57:06;57:10;"and kind of a co-songwriter or what was Jerry Cantrell's?"
57:10;57:13;"- I think the primary songwriter as far as I understand."
57:13;57:14;"- Yeah, primary songwriter."
57:14;57:15;"- He also sang quite a bit."
57:15;57:16;"- He was the harmony."
57:16;57:17;"- Yeah."
57:17;57:18;"- So he was singing a lot of those harmonies."
57:18;57:20;"And then you have bass and rhythm section"
57:20;57:22;"was the DeLeo brothers."
57:22;57:24;"(laughing)"
57:24;57:25;"That was STP, dude."
57:25;57:26;"- And it was-"
57:26;57:27;"- Oh, okay."
57:27;57:30;"- Dean and Robert DeLeo were the-"
57:30;57:31;"- The bassist and guitarist."
57:31;57:32;"- Yeah."
57:32;57:34;"- Wait, is it like Don DeLeo?"
57:34;57:35;"- Yeah."
57:35;57:36;"- Spelled differently."
57:36;57:37;"- No, no, no, spelled differently."
57:37;57:38;"It's D-E-L-E-O."
57:38;57:42;"Who are the two brothers on bass and drums in Alice in Chains?"
57:42;57:44;"- Honestly, couldn't tell you."
57:44;57:46;"- Mike Starr is the bass player."
57:46;57:48;"- Mike and Ricky Starr, the Starr brothers."
57:48;57:50;"- Mike and Spike Starr."
57:50;57:54;"And he left, I think,"
57:54;57:56;"'cause he had a crippling heroin addiction."
57:56;57:57;"- He was kicked out."
57:57;57:57;"- Yeah."
57:57;57:59;"- In early '93."
57:59;58:00;"- Damn."
58:00;58:03;"- And then the drummer is Mike."
58:03;58:06;"- I'm not wild about the drummer, I gotta say."
58:06;58:08;"I'm not wild about the bass playing and the drumming"
58:08;58:09;"in this band."
58:09;58:11;"It's really about Lane and Jerry."
58:11;58:14;"- I can't remember the drummer's name."
58:14;58:17;"- Speaking of, I've always said"
58:17;58:20;"how there's something about all these early '90s guys,"
58:20;58:23;"their names just sounded grunge."
58:23;58:24;"There were names that you would not have seen"
58:24;58:26;"in a different era of rock."
58:26;58:29;"Eddie Vedder, Kurt Cobain, Chris Novoselic,"
58:29;58:31;"especially Nirvana, Dave Grohl."
58:31;58:33;"There's names, you would not have seen them pop up"
58:33;58:35;"in the '60s or the '70s."
58:35;58:37;"But I can tell you, Jerry Cantrell,"
58:37;58:40;"that actually sounds like a dude playing guitar"
58:40;58:42;"on a record from 1968."
58:42;58:43;"- Oh yeah, for sure."
58:43;58:44;"- That's an old school name."
58:44;58:46;"- Yeah, Jerry Cantrell, he played with Ellis Presley."
58:46;58:47;"- Yeah."
58:47;58:48;"- Exactly."
58:48;58:50;"(laughing)"
58:50;58:55;"- He was in the Las Vegas Review Band."
58:55;58:58;"- And on guitar, on guitar, got my main man."
58:58;58:59;"Put your hands together for Jerry Cantrell."
58:59;59:00;"Woo!"
59:00;59:03;"- Jerry, his name's Jerry for Christ's sake."
59:03;59:04;"It's soft."
59:04;59:06;"- Yeah, the Jerry already obviously"
59:06;59:07;"is like a classic rock name,"
59:07;59:09;"and then the Cantrell just takes it to the next level."
59:09;59:12;"What's Jerry Cantrell been doing since--"
59:12;59:14;"- He's continuing Alice in Chains."
59:14;59:16;"- Right, who sings in Alice in Chains now?"
59:16;59:19;"They have a guy that sounds exactly like Lane."
59:19;59:20;"- Yep."
59:20;59:22;"Can I speak to how much you hate the drummer real quick,"
59:22;59:23;"Jake?"
59:23;59:24;"- Sure."
59:24;59:25;"- Have you ever listened to Jar of Flies,"
59:25;59:26;"the follow-up EP?"
59:26;59:28;"- Yeah, I know those songs."
59:28;59:30;"- Is it possible to throw on"
59:30;59:32;"just the beginning of No Excuses?"
59:32;59:36;"'Cause I think that encapsulates why he is not to like."
59:36;59:40;"- It's stiff, it's technical, and it's got a bad tone."
59:40;59:41;"- It's got too many cymbals."
59:41;59:43;"- And this says it all."
59:43;59:46;"(drumming)"
59:46;59:47;"- Thank you, Aaron."
59:47;59:49;"(drumming)"
59:49;59:54;"- I'm not mad at that."
59:54;59:56;"Wait, that's from 1993?"
59:56;59:57;"- It sounds like Dave Matthews Band."
59:57;01:00:02;"- Yeah, I enjoy the Dave Matthews Band element."
01:00:02;01:00:04;"- Here we go, the verses on the harmony."
01:00:04;01:00:07;"(drumming)"

01:00:31;01:00:33;"- Wait, can we hear that intro one more time, though?"
01:00:33;01:00:34;"I wanna hear that drum intro."
01:00:34;01:00:35;"- It just gives like a chill drum vibe."
01:00:35;01:00:38;"(drumming)"
01:00:38;01:00:41;"- It almost sounds like the beginning"
01:00:41;01:00:44;"of a Peter Gabriel song from like So, too."
01:00:44;01:00:47;"- Or it almost has like Tunnel of Love, Springsteen,"
01:00:47;01:00:48;"almost like--"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"- It sounds like '86, kind of."
01:00:50;01:00:53;"If you had some slight sample, like an ork stab or something."
01:00:56;01:01:02;"- Yeah, I actually think that Mike Starr was fine on bass,"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"and then when they got the other guy,"
01:01:04;01:01:08;"like Mike Inez, he's all busy."
01:01:08;01:01:11;"He's like the equivalent of the drummer, but on bass."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"- Right, too technical."
01:01:13;01:01:13;"- Yeah."
01:01:13;01:01:16;"- There's something about those harmonies that also,"
01:01:16;01:01:19;"when you hear like kind of haunting field recordings"
01:01:19;01:01:22;"of like regional folk music from like the '50s,"

01:03:05;01:03:08;"- I wonder if them calling it dirt"
01:03:08;01:03:11;"was like a grab at being more grunge."

01:05:50;01:05:52;"- If you're PJ curious, it's a great book"
01:05:52;01:05:55;"because you probably know many of the songs"

01:06:14;01:06:16;"All right, so let's get Steven on the phone."
01:06:16;01:06:20;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."

01:06:41;01:06:43;"I've actually been talking about this book since I read it,"

01:06:59;01:07:01;"with Jake at the Forum."
01:07:01;01:07:04;"- Yeah, and you did that episode about it"
01:07:04;01:07:07;"and you were with Adam from the War on Drugs."
01:07:07;01:07:10;"- Oh yeah, Adam from the War on Drugs came to the show."
01:07:10;01:07:12;"Actually, that's another thing, Jake."
01:07:12;01:07:13;"It's not very popping, but after that show,"
01:07:13;01:07:16;"we did have a little bit of a Pearl Jam text thread."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"- That's true."
01:07:17;01:07:20;"'Cause Steven, before you came on,"

01:07:41;01:07:42;"- Is that Alice in Chains thread?"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"Is that like really grim?"
01:07:44;01:07:47;"I just feel like if you're talking about Dirt,"
01:07:47;01:07:48;"it's a brilliant record,"
01:07:48;01:07:51;"but it's like one of the most depressing albums"
01:07:51;01:07:52;"of all time."
01:07:52;01:07:55;"- It's mostly texts about when can we get together"
01:07:55;01:07:56;"and drink and listen to Dirt?"
01:07:56;01:07:59;"(laughing)"
01:07:59;01:08:00;"And it's mostly like, I'm out of town,"
01:08:00;01:08:03;"the 10th to the 18th, I can't make it then."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"That's mostly what the text thread is."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"Although today was very active,"
01:08:06;01:08:09;"'cause I was trying to wrangle up some guests for the show,"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"and my brother Dave was gonna come on,"
01:08:11;01:08:12;"and he had to bail last minute,"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"'cause he's a huge Dirt head."
01:08:14;01:08:15;"Anyway."
01:08:15;01:08:17;"- What are you guys drinking on Dirt night?"
01:08:17;01:08:19;"- Hard, hard stuff."
01:08:19;01:08:19;"- Whiskey, bourbon."
01:08:19;01:08:21;"- Whiskey, tequila."
01:08:21;01:08:22;"- Everclear."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"(laughing)"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"- As long as it's not heroin."
01:08:26;01:08:27;"You know, as long as you're not"
01:08:27;01:08:28;"like shooting heroin together,"
01:08:28;01:08:29;"'cause I feel like that would be"
01:08:29;01:08:33;"the ultimate Dirt night expression."
01:08:33;01:08:36;"I feel like if you're just drinking Miller High Life"
01:08:36;01:08:39;"or something, that's like the safe Dirt night."
01:08:39;01:08:41;"- That's the dad's Dirt night."
01:08:41;01:08:42;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:08:42;01:08:45;"- That's like safe suburban dad's Dirt night."
01:08:45;01:08:46;"- When you're hanging out on Dirt night,"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"are you trying to discern like,"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"is this Layne Staley singing?"
01:08:50;01:08:53;"Is this Jerry Cantrell singing?"
01:08:53;01:08:54;"'Cause I always feel like that is,"
01:08:54;01:08:59;"if you're trying to dissect Alice in Chains sonically,"
01:08:59;01:09:02;"'cause there is like this thing with Alice in Chains,"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"I feel like where people feel like,"
01:09:04;01:09:07;"well, maybe Jerry Cantrell is like actually"
01:09:07;01:09:09;"the actual lead singer of that band,"
01:09:09;01:09:11;"because they're always singing together."
01:09:11;01:09:13;"Layne Staley gets so much credit as a great lead singer,"
01:09:13;01:09:17;"and he is, but I feel like especially as he faltered,"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"it was like Jerry Cantrell was almost like"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"the secret lead singer of that band."
01:09:21;01:09:26;"- Well, okay, I don't know their career very much after Dirt."
01:09:26;01:09:29;"Like Dirt is the height of the band."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"- Jake's a Dirt guy."
01:09:30;01:09:31;"- Yeah, I'm a Dirt guy, hey."
01:09:31;01:09:33;"(laughing)"
01:09:33;01:09:38;"On the song ""Wood"" and on the song ""Down in a Hole,"""
01:09:38;01:09:40;"that's Cantrell on the verses."
01:09:40;01:09:41;"- Right."
01:09:41;01:09:43;"- Maybe Layne is in there a little bit"
01:09:43;01:09:46;"on the harmonies with him, and they're gentle, they're soft."
01:09:46;01:09:51;"And then when the choruses just go off, huge choruses,"
01:09:51;01:09:53;"Layne comes in, we were just talking about this,"
01:09:53;01:09:56;"Layne comes in with no harmonies."
01:09:56;01:09:56;"- Right."
01:09:56;01:09:59;"- Like on ""Them Bones,"" it's like weird harmonies,"
01:09:59;01:10:03;"which is a really cool reversal of the classic"
01:10:03;01:10:07;"solo vocal verse, and then someone comes in on the chorus"
01:10:07;01:10:08;"just to beef it up a bit."
01:10:08;01:10:11;"- Well, if I may make a recommendation"
01:10:11;01:10:14;"for post-Dirt, Allison Chains."
01:10:14;01:10:15;"- Please."
01:10:15;01:10:19;"- The ""Jar of Flies"" EP is arguably as good as Dirt,"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"and it's a little more melodic, you know,"
01:10:21;01:10:24;"'cause that's like the unplugged version of Allison Chains."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"- Yeah, we were just listening to that"
01:10:26;01:10:26;"and making fun of the drum tone."
01:10:26;01:10:28;"- Jake can't stand the drummer."
01:10:28;01:10:32;"- I can't deal with, okay, here's the transition for you."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"I can't deal with the drummer of Allison Chains,"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"and I can't deal with the lead guitar player in Pearl Jam."
01:10:36;01:10:37;"So--"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"- Oh, what, McCready?"
01:10:39;01:10:40;"- I can't deal."
01:10:40;01:10:40;"- You're taking shots at McCready?"
01:10:40;01:10:41;"- Jake has been hating on McCready."
01:10:41;01:10:42;"- I can't deal with him."
01:10:42;01:10:43;"- Oh my God."
01:10:43;01:10:47;"- He's the most like hard rock cafe dude ever."
01:10:47;01:10:47;"(laughing)"
01:10:47;01:10:51;"He's the most awkward lead guitar player"
01:10:51;01:10:53;"of a major band I can think of."
01:10:53;01:10:55;"- Oh my God."
01:10:55;01:10:56;"- There's 10,000 guys like him."
01:10:56;01:10:58;"- I can't believe you're going that hard on him, Jake."
01:10:58;01:11:01;"Even at the show, Jake was just standing there"
01:11:01;01:11:03;"just being like, not feeling McCready."
01:11:03;01:11:06;"- I feel like this is like ""Saving Private Ryan,"""
01:11:06;01:11:08;"and like they're taking shots,"
01:11:08;01:11:12;"I'm taking bullets coming out on the beach immediately,"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"taking shots at McCready, 'cause like,"
01:11:14;01:11:15;"I mean, I write about this in the book,"
01:11:15;01:11:17;"he's my favorite member of the band."
01:11:17;01:11:18;"- Oh, wow."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"- So now like we're really throwing it down here."
01:11:20;01:11:21;"- We're at laundry heads."
01:11:21;01:11:22;"- I mean, I'll throw this out there"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"just like as an alternative thing,"
01:11:24;01:11:25;"maybe this will change your mind."
01:11:25;01:11:29;"I think that if you look at Pearl Jam"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"from a jam band perspective,"
01:11:31;01:11:34;"and if you're looking at the live recordings,"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"that McCready is the one who is bringing"
01:11:36;01:11:40;"the improvisational aspect to the live stuff."
01:11:40;01:11:43;"So like, if you're listening to like ""Even Flow,"""
01:11:43;01:11:47;"for instance, the like thousandth live version"
01:11:47;01:11:49;"of that song, the only reason why it's different"
01:11:49;01:11:52;"is what McCready is bringing to the table,"
01:11:52;01:11:56;"because he is playing a different solo every single time."
01:11:56;01:11:59;"Like he's the one who, I think especially live,"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"I mean, it's funny that you say this,"
01:12:01;01:12:03;"'cause like I went to go see Pearl Jam"
01:12:03;01:12:07;"with my friend Rob, who I did the ""36 From the Vault"""
01:12:07;01:12:08;"podcast with."
01:12:08;01:12:09;"- Oh, right, right."
01:12:09;01:12:11;"- And he was rolling his eyes at McCready a lot,"
01:12:11;01:12:12;"because he's very hammy live."
01:12:12;01:12:15;"He's like stalking around the stage,"
01:12:15;01:12:19;"he's like doing a lot of the rock theatric type stuff."
01:12:19;01:12:23;"But I think musically, he's the one who's like"
01:12:23;01:12:27;"bringing different things to every live performance"
01:12:27;01:12:28;"that they do."
01:12:28;01:12:32;"So that is part of like what I really like about him."
01:12:32;01:12:34;"If you wanna say there's a Jerry,"
01:12:34;01:12:35;"you wanna say Eddie is the Jerry,"
01:12:35;01:12:38;"but in a way, musically speaking,"
01:12:38;01:12:41;"McCready is the Jerry of Pearl Jam"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"in the sense of the guitar player"
01:12:44;01:12:47;"changing up the live versions every time they play live."
01:12:47;01:12:48;"- How about this?"
01:12:48;01:12:49;"There's no Jerry in Pearl Jam."
01:12:49;01:12:51;"(laughing)"
01:12:51;01:12:53;"Pearl Jam is Pearl Jam."
01:12:53;01:12:55;"The Grateful Dead are the Grateful Dead."
01:12:55;01:12:57;"- There's not even a Jerry Cantrell."
01:12:57;01:13:00;"- There's not even a Cantrell."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"He plays a different guitar solo every night"
01:13:02;01:13:03;"and they're all bad."
01:13:03;01:13:04;"I'm sorry."
01:13:04;01:13:06;"He can just be the weak guy."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"He can be like the SNL. - Jake is hating."
01:13:08;01:13:09;"- I'm sorry."
01:13:09;01:13:11;"Just sub him in for the guy that played"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"for the SNL band for 10 years."
01:13:13;01:13:15;"- I just like haven't played--"
01:13:15;01:13:16;"- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"You're taking shots at G.E. Smith now?"
01:13:18;01:13:19;"- Absolutely."
01:13:19;01:13:22;"- We're taking G.E. Smith shots?"
01:13:22;01:13:27;"- I'm taking shots at Hard Rock Cafe blues guitar players."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"Not interesting."
01:13:28;01:13:29;"- Oh dear."
01:13:29;01:13:30;"- I'm sorry, Steve."
01:13:30;01:13:30;"We're getting off on the wrong foot here."
01:13:30;01:13:32;"- First of all, I didn't know."
01:13:32;01:13:34;"- The only way to settle this is,"
01:13:34;01:13:37;"Steven, can you make Jake a playlist"
01:13:37;01:13:40;"of your top 25 even flows?"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"Try to spread them out over the last 30 years."
01:13:42;01:13:45;"- Your top 25 even flows."
01:13:45;01:13:46;"Jake."

01:15:06;01:15:08;"I had never seen Pearl Jam before."
01:15:08;01:15:10;"And I gotta say, I was so charmed with Vedder."
01:15:10;01:15:13;"I mean, to me Vedder is the band."
01:15:13;01:15:16;"He was such an incredible front man, great banter."
01:15:16;01:15:18;"I think we covered this on the show."
01:15:18;01:15:20;"He told this whole story about going,"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"trying to go see Pink Floyd and the wall era."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"His buddy lost one of the tickets."
01:15:24;01:15:27;"He just sat in his parking lot stoned all night."
01:15:27;01:15:28;"And then when he told it,"
01:15:28;01:15:31;"this like nice kind of drawn out five minute anecdote,"
01:15:31;01:15:32;"he won me over."
01:15:32;01:15:33;"I mean, hell of a front man."
01:15:33;01:15:35;"There's no band without Vedder."
01:15:35;01:15:38;"That to me, Vedder is the Jerry, even though there's no Jerry."
01:15:38;01:15:41;"- Well, can I just say too that because of Vedder,"
01:15:41;01:15:43;"I'll give Vedder credit for this."
01:15:43;01:15:47;"I think it was like '06 when Pearl Jam played,"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"I think it was Columbus, Ohio."
01:15:49;01:15:52;"Robert Pollard opened for,"
01:15:52;01:15:56;"the Robert Pollard Solar Band opened for Pearl Jam."
01:15:56;01:15:58;"And they played Bob O'Reilly together."
01:15:58;01:16:01;"Like Robert Pollard sang it with Pearl Jam."
01:16:01;01:16:03;"So because of Eddie Vedder,"
01:16:03;01:16:05;"Robert Pollard, guided by voices,"
01:16:05;01:16:09;"got to sing Bob O'Reilly in an arena."
01:16:09;01:16:12;"So I feel like any Pearl Jam skeptic"
01:16:12;01:16:16;"from an indie rock world ought to be able to recognize,"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"we all want to hear Robert Pollard sing Bob O'Reilly"
01:16:18;01:16:22;"in a huge room and it's because of Eddie Vedder."
01:16:22;01:16:25;"So that's another thing that you,"
01:16:25;01:16:27;"just to tie the worlds together."
01:16:27;01:16:28;"- Now you're just brown."
01:16:28;01:16:33;"- Well, I'm trying to bring Jake back here"
01:16:33;01:16:34;"because, okay."
01:16:34;01:16:37;"- This is one of the funniest situations."
01:16:37;01:16:39;"This is the worst first date."
01:16:39;01:16:40;"I know it's not a first date."
01:16:40;01:16:41;"(laughing)"
01:16:41;01:16:42;"- It's all love."
01:16:42;01:16:43;"- It's a really sit down."
01:16:43;01:16:44;"- It's all love."
01:16:44;01:16:44;"- We haven't even started the top five guys."
01:16:44;01:16:46;"- That's funny too."
01:16:46;01:16:48;"That's such like a genre of like,"
01:16:48;01:16:51;"kind of like a tweet or like a social media post"
01:16:51;01:16:52;"where somebody's like,"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"""I think I'm sitting next to the worst Tinder date"

01:16:55;01:16:56;"(laughing)"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"You know, like the girl's vegan"
01:16:58;01:17:01;"and the guys just told her she just got back"
01:17:01;01:17:03;"from a hunting in the woods."
01:17:03;01:17:05;"And he took down a 5.0."
01:17:05;01:17:06;"It's like that."
01:17:06;01:17:07;"It's like, ""Hey guys,"
01:17:07;01:17:09;"I think I'm at the worst Tinder date of all time."
01:17:09;01:17:12;"This dude just opened with how much he hates"
01:17:12;01:17:13;"Mike McCready of Pearl Jam."
01:17:13;01:17:14;"And the girl just said,"
01:17:14;01:17:17;"""That's actually my favorite member of the band."""
01:17:17;01:17:20;"And they're both 22, which is pretty cool."
01:17:20;01:17:22;"22 year olds talking PJ on the first date."
01:17:22;01:17:25;"- It's two 45 year old guys talking PJ."
01:17:25;01:17:27;"We're both 77, I think, right, Seton?"
01:17:27;01:17:28;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:17:28;01:17:30;"You're February 77."
01:17:30;01:17:31;"- Yeah."
01:17:31;01:17:32;"- I'm September."
01:17:32;01:17:34;"- So I'm English town."
01:17:34;01:17:35;"- Nice."
01:17:35;01:17:36;"- 77."
01:17:36;01:17:38;"In February, you would have been like,"
01:17:38;01:17:41;"you know, Madison, Wisconsin, probably."
01:17:41;01:17:43;"And February 77."
01:17:43;01:17:46;"I just brought up the power of the dead."
01:17:46;01:17:47;"I'm trying to bring you back here."
01:17:47;01:17:49;"- No, we're good, we're good, man."
01:17:49;01:17:50;"- Jake likes Pearl Jam, right?"
01:17:50;01:17:51;"- I do."
01:17:51;01:17:52;"I like Pearl Jam."
01:17:52;01:17:54;"- I mean, I feel bad that McCready's taking so much ire,"
01:17:54;01:17:55;"but okay, well, Stephen,"
01:17:55;01:17:57;"you can definitely speak to this"
01:17:57;01:18:00;"because I think one thing I love about the book,"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"I was saying this earlier,"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"is, and why I think your book is great"
01:18:04;01:18:05;"for even Pearl Jam skeptics,"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"maybe especially for Pearl Jam skeptics,"
01:18:07;01:18:11;"just 'cause it's like, you give people lots of context."
01:18:11;01:18:12;"Like you'll go off on a whole thing"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"about Stone Temple Pilots"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"or what was happening in the larger music world."
01:18:16;01:18:19;"You also really are interested in the band dynamics"
01:18:19;01:18:20;"and stuff like that."
01:18:20;01:18:22;"So you kind of keep it interesting"
01:18:22;01:18:23;"from a human perspective."
01:18:23;01:18:26;"Can you just give us your general take"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"about the humans in this band,"
01:18:28;01:18:31;"the elements of this band that come together,"
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Vetter is the type,"
01:18:32;01:18:33;"""Oh guys, it'd be cool to get Robert Power"
01:18:33;01:18:35;"to come sing Bob O'Reilly with us."""
01:18:35;01:18:36;"What are the other people,"
01:18:36;01:18:38;"such as the Mike McCready represent,"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"'cause obviously it's only Pearl Jam"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"with all of these people."
01:18:42;01:18:44;"Can you just give us your kind of bird's eye view"
01:18:44;01:18:47;"of how Pearl Jam reached this kind of the harmony"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"that makes them them?"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"What are the elements, the people, the influences?"
01:18:51;01:18:55;"- Yeah, so there's a phrase that I seize upon"
01:18:55;01:18:58;"early in the book that came from Matt Cameron,"
01:18:58;01:19:02;"where he described Pearl Jam as punk rock, arena rock,"
01:19:02;01:19:06;"which in my interpretation is this idea"
01:19:06;01:19:08;"of simultaneously being a band"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"that can play arenas and stadiums"
01:19:10;01:19:14;"and sort of be reminiscent of the bands of the past"
01:19:14;01:19:16;"that would play those types of rooms."
01:19:16;01:19:20;"You know, The Who, Zeppelin, Bruce Springsteen,"
01:19:20;01:19:24;"and at the same time operate like a band"
01:19:24;01:19:27;"that comes from the punk rock world."
01:19:27;01:19:30;"You know, specifically like the '80s indie world"
01:19:30;01:19:33;"that certainly people like Jeff Amitt"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"and Stone Gossard came from,"
01:19:35;01:19:37;"you know, playing in Green River,"
01:19:37;01:19:42;"you know, very sort of early Seattle punk band,"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"you know, from the mid '80s into the late '80s."
01:19:44;01:19:48;"And I think that that's a big part"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"of like why they've been able to stick around"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"for a long time."
01:19:52;01:19:56;"They can be a band that if you wanna see"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"The Who or Aerosmith or, you know,"
01:19:58;01:20:01;"like a band like that in a big room"
01:20:01;01:20:05;"and that can hit like that and deliver like that,"
01:20:05;01:20:06;"even in ways that like, you know,"
01:20:06;01:20:09;"like Jake was talking about, like the House of Rock thing,"
01:20:09;01:20:12;"I mean, that is part of the rock and roll tree, you know?"
01:20:12;01:20:13;"And I wouldn't say House of Rock."
01:20:13;01:20:15;"I would say Mike McCready is more of like"
01:20:15;01:20:19;"the Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan type style"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"of guitar playing, and maybe Stevie Ray Vaughan"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"would fall more into that House of Rock thing,"
01:20:23;01:20:26;"but that is part of like the arena rock tree."
01:20:26;01:20:29;"So they can be that, but they can also be a band"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"that has a lineage that does come from"
01:20:31;01:20:32;"like the indie rock world,"
01:20:32;01:20:35;"and maybe they carry themselves more"
01:20:35;01:20:38;"like a band that would be from there."
01:20:38;01:20:43;"And it seems like an impossible combination to pull off."
01:20:43;01:20:45;"And I think Pearl Jam over the course of their career,"
01:20:45;01:20:47;"it was always about trying to figure out a way"
01:20:47;01:20:52;"to pull that off, 'cause it is a really hard balancing act"
01:20:52;01:20:55;"to execute, but I think they really did figure it out"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"in the long run, 'cause like you look at them now,"
01:20:57;01:21:01;"and you just saw them at the, was it at the Forum in LA?"
01:21:01;01:21:02;"- Yeah, Forum."
01:21:02;01:21:05;"- So the Forum, they can play the Forum,"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"they can sell it out, but at the same time,"
01:21:07;01:21:10;"they're like, they have like really no media profile at all."
01:21:10;01:21:12;"You know, like when I've been talking about this book,"
01:21:12;01:21:16;"I often compare Eddie Vedder to Dave Grohl, you know,"
01:21:16;01:21:19;"and no shots at Dave Grohl, I mean, he's great,"
01:21:19;01:21:21;"but like Dave Grohl, like when they promote,"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"whenever there's like a new Foo Fighters record,"
01:21:23;01:21:24;"he's like all over the place."
01:21:24;01:21:28;"He's on award shows, he's on talk shows, very ubiquitous,"
01:21:28;01:21:31;"whereas Eddie Vedder has really avoided that"
01:21:31;01:21:34;"for a long time, and yet he still has the same"
01:21:34;01:21:37;"rockstar friends, you know, he can still play"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"the same big places, but it's like,"
01:21:39;01:21:43;"it can be invisible and very visible simultaneously."
01:21:43;01:21:46;"And again, that's a really hard thing to do,"
01:21:46;01:21:48;"but they've been able to pull it off for a long time."
01:21:48;01:21:52;"And I think that's the key to like their long-term survival."
01:21:52;01:21:54;"- And it is interesting, like,"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"I feel like I've noticed more people,"
01:21:56;01:21:59;"maybe it's just a natural function of time,"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"becoming kind of interested in Pearl Jam,"
01:22:01;01:22:04;"maybe just because they're hitting that 30 year mark"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"and people get interested in stuff"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"when it's been around 30 years and start to be like,"
01:22:08;01:22:10;"whether you like them back in the day,"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"were agnostic, disliked them,"
01:22:12;01:22:15;"I feel like there's been some growing energy lately."
01:22:15;01:22:17;"Maybe I'm just speaking about myself,"
01:22:17;01:22:18;"but we're just kind of like, oh yeah, Pearl Jam,"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"I'll go see Pearl Jam."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"Oh yeah, I've got a buddy, they go see Pearl Jam"
01:22:21;01:22:23;"every time they come to town."
01:22:23;01:22:25;"As you promote this book and talk about it,"
01:22:25;01:22:28;"is there a bit of a Pearl Jam renaissance happening?"
01:22:28;01:22:31;"- I don't know, I mean, there are really interesting"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"battle in that regard because,"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"and I don't want to put too much weight on this,"
01:22:35;01:22:39;"but like Pitchfork just put out a new list"
01:22:39;01:22:43;"of like the best albums of the 90s, 150 albums."
01:22:43;01:22:43;"- Oh, oh, I haven't seen that."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"- Very controversial."
01:22:45;01:22:47;"And there's like no Pearl Jam albums on there."
01:22:47;01:22:48;"I think-"
01:22:48;01:22:49;"- Zero Pearl Jam."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"- Zero Pearl Jam."
01:22:50;01:22:51;"- Really?"
01:22:51;01:22:52;"- Zero Pearl Jam."
01:22:52;01:22:53;"- Versus?"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"- Nothing from Pearl Jam."
01:22:55;01:22:59;"They did put Corduroy on their songs list this week,"
01:22:59;01:23:01;"which actually I was kind of surprised by"
01:23:01;01:23:05;"because Pitchfork generally,"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"if you look at their archives,"
01:23:06;01:23:09;"like they're not very positive toward that band,"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"but it is interesting."
01:23:11;01:23:13;"I don't feel like they've really,"
01:23:13;01:23:16;"they don't seem like the band that is like canonical"
01:23:16;01:23:17;"like to like younger generations yet"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"in the way that like Nirvana is."
01:23:19;01:23:22;"- And I'm curious about this, not having seen this list,"
01:23:22;01:23:24;"like for instance, is Nevermind in the top 10?"
01:23:24;01:23:26;"- It is in the top 10,"
01:23:26;01:23:30;"but like Holes lived through this as like two spots higher,"
01:23:30;01:23:31;"which was interesting to me."
01:23:31;01:23:32;"- Oh my God."
01:23:32;01:23:33;"- Like Nevermind-"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"- That is so funny."
01:23:35;01:23:36;"- Nevermind was number 10."
01:23:36;01:23:39;"It's an interesting top 10 list for the albums"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"because like Loveless,"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"My Bloody Valentine record was number one,"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"which actually surprised me a little bit."
01:23:45;01:23:46;"- That's kind of old school."
01:23:46;01:23:47;"- Exactly."
01:23:47;01:23:50;"And then like Lauryn Hill was number two."
01:23:50;01:23:51;"Okay, Computer was number three."
01:23:51;01:23:54;"I forget what comes after that, but so-"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"- Okay, so those are all like,"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"none of those are surprises that they'd be in the top 10."
01:23:58;01:24:01;"Again, perhaps the particular order is irrelevant."
01:24:01;01:24:03;"It's more like, all right, what's top 10?"
01:24:03;01:24:04;"What's top 50?"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"♪ Don't be mad ♪"
01:24:09;01:24:13;"♪ You're finally here and I'm a mess ♪"
01:24:13;01:24:16;"♪ I take your interest back ♪"
01:24:16;01:24:21;"♪ Can't let you roam inside my head ♪"
01:24:21;01:24:24;"♪ I don't wanna take what you can't give ♪"
01:24:24;01:24:28;"♪ I'd rather starve than eat your bread ♪"
01:24:28;01:24:31;"♪ I'd rather run but I can't walk ♪"
01:24:31;01:24:36;"♪ Guess I'll lie alone just like before ♪"
01:24:36;01:24:37;"- Where's Dirt?"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"- I don't know if Dirt made it, actually."
01:24:39;01:24:42;"It's funny 'cause like you see these lists and like,"
01:24:42;01:24:47;"and I hate that I do this because it annoys me."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"Like if I make my own list and people do this,"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"but like you do the control F"
01:24:51;01:24:54;"and you put in the thing that you are curious,"
01:24:54;01:24:55;"where did this land?"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"I think I looked up like Siamese Dream."
01:24:57;01:25:00;"- I mean, I was half kidding you by suggesting that."
01:25:00;01:25:03;"I assume Dirt is not on the list, if I had to guess."
01:25:03;01:25:06;"- They recently did like a Pitchfork review on Dirt."
01:25:06;01:25:09;"They did like a, it's funny that we're doing so much Dirt talk."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"- Dirt is not on the list."
01:25:11;01:25:12;"- Oh, no Dirt? - Dirt is not on the list."
01:25:12;01:25:15;"- Nick, do you think of B-1000 and Alien Lanes?"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"- I can tell you. - Okay, thank you, Steven."
01:25:17;01:25:20;"- I can tell you, Alien Lanes is not on the list."
01:25:20;01:25:22;"B-1000, I believe is about 129."
01:25:22;01:25:24;"Maybe we can confirm that, but I think it was about--"
01:25:24;01:25:27;"- We're talking about the most underrated rock bands"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"of all time, Alice in Chains and GBB."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"(laughing)"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"- AIC and GBB."
01:25:33;01:25:34;"- How about this?"
01:25:34;01:25:37;"- B-1000, yeah, B-1000, 123."
01:25:37;01:25:41;"- GBB, underrated, MBV, overrated."
01:25:41;01:25:43;"- Can I just say too, since we're talking"
01:25:43;01:25:46;"about the Pitchfork list here,"
01:25:46;01:25:48;"Octoon Baby was like 118."
01:25:48;01:25:49;"I think that's way too low."
01:25:49;01:25:51;"Can we talk about U2 for a second?"
01:25:51;01:25:54;"- Sure. - I think they're way underrated."
01:25:54;01:25:59;"I think Octoon Baby is for sure at least a top five album"
01:25:59;01:26:02;"of the '90s, as far as I'm concerned."
01:26:02;01:26:05;"- Well, I wouldn't go top five, but I would--"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"- I would for sure for myself."
01:26:07;01:26:10;"I think that album is a masterpiece."
01:26:10;01:26:11;"- No, I love it. - It's very good,"
01:26:11;01:26:14;"but I mean, I guess as, I know this is the exact type"
01:26:14;01:26:15;"of thing that you talked-- - Guys, just want you"
01:26:15;01:26:16;"to take a guess. - Yeah."
01:26:16;01:26:20;"- Steven, you do not get to answer since you know the list."
01:26:20;01:26:22;"Where do you think Dookie falls?"
01:26:22;01:26:25;"- Beautiful album."
01:26:25;01:26:27;"Okay, it was a number one, it was a number two,"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"and it was a number three, so I'm guessing four."
01:26:29;01:26:30;"- I'm gonna guess-- - Just kidding."
01:26:30;01:26:33;"- I'm gonna guess 115."
01:26:33;01:26:35;"- I'm gonna say not on the list."
01:26:35;01:26:37;"- I mean, that would be incredible if I did,"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"if it was a trick question."
01:26:39;01:26:41;"No, it's, what did you say, Jake?"
01:26:41;01:26:44;"- 115. - Ooh, it's 111."
01:26:44;01:26:46;"- Wow, good guess. - Ooh, wow."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"- Really good, Jake. - Thank you."
01:26:47;01:26:48;"- Wow. - I think like--"
01:26:48;01:26:52;"- Arthur Russell's ""Another Thought,"" that's 115."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"- That's '90s?"
01:26:53;01:26:56;"- Wait, was that like the '80s?"
01:26:56;01:26:57;"- That doesn't count."
01:26:57;01:27:00;"- '94. - It's like a reissue?"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"- Where is ""Siamese Dream?"""
01:27:02;01:27:04;"- It's like '98, I believe."
01:27:04;01:27:09;"- Damn, you're so good, I mean, you're, yes, it's '98."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"- Well, because this was something I looked up--"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"- It's incredible, Steven."
01:27:12;01:27:15;"- I looked that up specifically because I felt like,"
01:27:15;01:27:18;"again, as a aging music writer,"
01:27:18;01:27:22;"I felt like that was way too low on the list"
01:27:22;01:27:25;"'cause I was DMing with various people about this list."
01:27:25;01:27:26;"Someone brought up Dookie,"
01:27:26;01:27:28;"and someone brought up the self-titled"
01:27:28;01:27:30;"""Rage Against the Machine."""
01:27:30;01:27:31;"- That album, like the self-titled?"
01:27:31;01:27:34;"- Sure, where do you think that fell?"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"- I'm gonna guess 43. - I looked that one up."
01:27:36;01:27:38;"- Yeah, I was gonna say 40-something."
01:27:38;01:27:40;"- 120."
01:27:40;01:27:42;"- Ouch, oh, deep."
01:27:42;01:27:45;"- Which I'm not even a huge ""Rage Against the Machine"" fan,"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"but that seems way too low for me."
01:27:47;01:27:50;"- Okay, I remember the last time, like two years ago,"
01:27:50;01:27:53;"during COVID, Rolling Stone did the top 500 albums"
01:27:53;01:27:57;"of all time, and the top indie rock album,"
01:27:57;01:27:58;"do you guys remember what it was?"
01:27:58;01:27:59;"- Top indie rock album?"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"- It was a Matador release in the '90s,"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"and it wasn't ""Pavement,"" and it wasn't ""GBV."""
01:28:03;01:28:04;"- What'd be ""Liz Phair"" and ""Sebastian""?"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"- Yes, it was ""Liz Phair."""
01:28:06;01:28:07;"- Yeah, yeah, ""Exile"" and ""Guy-Ville."""
01:28:07;01:28:08;"- ""Liz Phair"" was the top indie rock album"
01:28:08;01:28:11;"on the top 500 list two years ago."
01:28:11;01:28:15;"I'm gonna guess ""Exile"" and ""Guy-Ville"" is number nine."
01:28:15;01:28:16;"- Number four."
01:28:16;01:28:17;"- Oh! - That was number four?"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"- Ooh, it took the Dookie slot."
01:28:19;01:28:24;"- It took Dookie, and they threw Dookie all the way to 111."
01:28:24;01:28:26;"- This is gonna be so all over the place."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"It's possible that we're done talking about ""Pearl Jam."""
01:28:27;01:28:29;"Maybe that's a good thing."
01:28:29;01:28:30;"You've been talking about ""Pearl Jam"""
01:28:30;01:28:32;"so much lately, right, Stephen?"
01:28:32;01:28:36;"- I mean, I'm happy to talk about ""Pearl Jam"""
01:28:36;01:28:37;"till the cows come home, but-"
01:28:37;01:28:40;"- Well, everybody, look, check out the book, everybody."
01:28:40;01:28:42;"- I love all of Stephen's books."
01:28:42;01:28:43;"I haven't got the PJ book yet."
01:28:43;01:28:44;"I'm gonna get it."
01:28:44;01:28:48;"I'm gonna read it, despite my misgivings of Mike McReady."
01:28:48;01:28:50;"I'm psyched to read this book."
01:28:50;01:28:52;"Stephen's a great writer, iconic band."
01:28:52;01:28:54;"I'll hit up the PJ thread,"
01:28:54;01:28:56;"and we'll add Stephen to that thread if he wants."
01:28:56;01:28:58;"Maybe he's PJ'd out."
01:28:58;01:28:59;"I don't know."
01:28:59;01:29:00;"- I mean, the thread, man."
01:29:00;01:29:02;"I mean, the Alice in Chains thread."
01:29:02;01:29:03;"- Oh, you know what I was gonna say?"
01:29:03;01:29:07;"Jake, Jake, we should buy it for Brian and Adam,"
01:29:07;01:29:08;"the other two guys on the list."
01:29:08;01:29:11;"We should buy them Stephen's book as a group chat present."
01:29:11;01:29:12;"- That's a great call."
01:29:12;01:29:14;"- Before I click out of this window."
01:29:14;01:29:15;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:29:15;01:29:16;"- Time out of mind."
01:29:16;01:29:18;"- Ooh, I was just thinking about that."
01:29:18;01:29:19;"- Is it on the list?"
01:29:19;01:29:20;"And if so, where does it fall?"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"- Well, I think it's gonna be high."
01:29:22;01:29:23;"I think it's gonna be high."
01:29:23;01:29:26;"It's gonna be, well, I think, first of all,"
01:29:26;01:29:27;"Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 3,"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"which came out in the '90s."
01:29:29;01:29:30;"That's probably number five."
01:29:30;01:29:33;"And then I think Time Out of Mind, an actual studio album."
01:29:33;01:29:35;"I think it's gonna be like 28."
01:29:35;01:29:38;"- Because I follow the Jokerman Podcast Twitter feed,"
01:29:38;01:29:40;"it's pretty much my entire Twitter feed"
01:29:40;01:29:43;"is basically just Bob Dylan at this point."
01:29:43;01:29:45;"Not on the list."
01:29:45;01:29:46;"- 68."
01:29:46;01:29:46;"- Oh, I guess I was wrong."
01:29:46;01:29:47;"I guess I misread the tweets."
01:29:47;01:29:49;"- So you were, yeah."
01:29:49;01:29:50;"- But I was a bit close."
01:29:50;01:29:51;"I mean, I just wanted to-"
01:29:51;01:29:52;"- You were very close."
01:29:52;01:29:53;"- Not as close as Jake and Dookie,"
01:29:53;01:29:54;"but it's interesting."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"- I think you know it's in the top 100."
01:29:56;01:29:58;"- Yeah, we were talking about a lot of records"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"that were falling outside the top 100."
01:30:00;01:30:01;"I do think Time Out of Mind's having a moment."
01:30:01;01:30:04;"And I wanted to say, just speaking of Steven's writing"
01:30:04;01:30:06;"and the fact that we went so deep on Bob Dylan"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"recently on the program,"
01:30:08;01:30:11;"one piece of Steven's writing that I really enjoy"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"and that I found myself returning to a lot"
01:30:13;01:30:17;"in my post Bob Dylan Greatest Hits Volume 3 mania"
01:30:17;01:30:21;"was Steven's Every Bob Dylan Studio Album Ranked,"
01:30:21;01:30:22;"which he wrote for Uproxx."
01:30:22;01:30:23;"- Yes."
01:30:23;01:30:26;"- And that to all of the Time Crisis fans"
01:30:26;01:30:30;"who got into middle period Bob Dylan via our two-parter,"
01:30:30;01:30:33;"and maybe you're interested in going through because-"
01:30:33;01:30:34;"- Can I just say, by the way,"
01:30:34;01:30:39;"that I love that you did a middle period Bob Dylan"
01:30:39;01:30:40;"like two-parter?"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"That's so inspiring to me."
01:30:42;01:30:45;"I love that this has become so normalized."
01:30:45;01:30:46;"I was just gonna say too,"
01:30:46;01:30:49;"I mean, I was joking about this with the Joker Men guys"
01:30:49;01:30:53;"that Froggy K McCorton from Good As I've Been To You"
01:30:53;01:30:56;"should have been on the songs list for-"
01:30:56;01:30:57;"- Some of his early 90s work."
01:30:57;01:31:01;"- His cover of Froggy K McCorton"
01:31:01;01:31:04;"that was woefully underappreciated"
01:31:04;01:31:08;"on the best songs list of the 90s."
01:31:08;01:31:10;"- Where's Wiggle Wiggle?"
01:31:10;01:31:10;"I mean, come on."
01:31:10;01:31:11;"- Right."
01:31:11;01:31:14;"Well, I mean, all kidding aside,"
01:31:14;01:31:15;"you could have put Lovesick"
01:31:15;01:31:20;"or Standing In The Doorway on that songs list"
01:31:20;01:31:21;"as legit great songs."
01:31:21;01:31:24;"But anyway, Ezra, I'm sorry."
01:31:24;01:31:25;"Sorry to interrupt you."
01:31:25;01:31:26;"- Well, I was just saying, it's a great piece of writing,"
01:31:26;01:31:27;"but one thing I should say,"
01:31:27;01:31:29;"and I don't know if Jake, if you've seen it,"
01:31:29;01:31:33;"but because via Bob Dylan's career since volume three,"
01:31:33;01:31:36;"me and Jake got so deep into Brownsville Girl,"
01:31:36;01:31:39;"I was a little bit sad to see that you put"
01:31:39;01:31:42;"knocked out, loaded, dead last"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"on your list number 39."
01:31:45;01:31:48;"And you give it up for Brownsville Girl."
01:31:48;01:31:50;"And to be fair, I do have to say Stephen's writing,"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"it really comes from a fan place."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"Over and over again in the list,"
01:31:53;01:31:56;"you make it clear that you love all Bob Dylan's music."
01:31:56;01:31:59;"And it's kind of a matter of which day you make the list,"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"but you did put knocked out, loaded, dead last."
01:32:01;01:32:03;"- And I love knocked out, loaded."
01:32:03;01:32:05;"You know, I mean, it's like not a knock on that album."
01:32:05;01:32:07;"It's like, if you're gonna rank Bob Dylan albums,"
01:32:07;01:32:08;"something has to be last."
01:32:08;01:32:11;"It doesn't mean you don't like it in a way."
01:32:11;01:32:15;"If you had to make your top 200 albums of all time,"
01:32:15;01:32:18;"knocked out and loaded would be number 39, number 40."
01:32:18;01:32:20;"- Right, exactly."
01:32:20;01:32:23;"- Okay, computer, number 41, Sergeant Pepper."
01:32:23;01:32:27;"But it's just, every Bob Dylan album is one through 39."
01:32:27;01:32:29;"- Exactly, I mean, 'cause you know,"
01:32:29;01:32:33;"the thing with Bob is that every album of his"
01:32:33;01:32:36;"that you think is bad will become your favorite album"
01:32:36;01:32:37;"in like five years."
01:32:37;01:32:39;"Like that's the thing I realized with him."
01:32:39;01:32:42;"Because honestly, like the thing I would be least interested"
01:32:42;01:32:46;"in putting on is, you know, something like ""Triplicate,"""
01:32:46;01:32:51;"you know, which is his triple album of standards."
01:32:51;01:32:53;"And like each album is like a half hour long"
01:32:53;01:32:56;"and it's the same tempo."
01:32:56;01:33:01;"But I know that at some point that is going to be the album"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"I am most obsessed with,"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"because that's just how Bob Dylan is."
01:33:05;01:33:07;"- That was ""Evans Doesn't Miss."""
01:33:07;01:33:09;"Wasn't that ""Evans"" number one?"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"- Yes, yeah."
01:33:11;01:33:12;"- He was trolling, I mean."
01:33:12;01:33:15;"- But he may not be though."
01:33:15;01:33:18;"- No, I mean, ""Jokerman"" mindset is deep."
01:33:18;01:33:22;"It affects, it's like a zombie apocalypse."
01:33:22;01:33:23;"- It affects us all eventually."
01:33:23;01:33:26;"- I really tried to get into ""Tempest"""
01:33:26;01:33:28;"based on the ""Jokerman's"" recommendation."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"And it definitely has its moments."
01:33:30;01:33:33;"- Well, there was this movie I seen one time"
01:33:33;01:33:37;"about a man riding across the desert"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"and it starred Gregory Peck."
01:33:39;01:33:44;"He was shot down by a hungry kid"
01:33:44;01:33:47;"trying to make a name for himself."
01:33:47;01:33:51;"The townspeople wanted to dress that kid down"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"and string him up by the neck."
01:33:53;01:33:58;"Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp."
01:33:58;01:34:05;"As the dying gunfighter lay under sun and gas"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"for his last breath."
01:34:07;01:34:10;"Turn him loose, let him go,"
01:34:10;01:34:13;"let him say he'll do me fair and square."
01:34:13;01:34:17;"I want him to feel what it's like"
01:34:17;01:34:20;"to every moment face his death."
01:34:20;01:34:24;"Well, I keep seeing this stuff"
01:34:24;01:34:26;"and it just comes a-rollin' in."
01:34:26;01:34:33;"And you know it blows right through me like a ball of chain."
01:34:35;01:34:37;"You know, I can't believe we've lived so long"
01:34:37;01:34:40;"and are still so far apart."
01:34:40;01:34:45;"The memory of you keeps calling after me"
01:34:45;01:34:48;"like a rolling train."
01:34:48;01:34:52;"- I will say, and I know Jake, you can relate to this"
01:34:52;01:34:53;"'cause we talk about it a lot."
01:34:53;01:34:55;"Like, what records are you actually gonna throw on?"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"And Steven, before you came on, Jake was saying"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"he listens to ""Dirt"" a lot more"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"than he listens to ""Nevermind"""
01:35:01;01:35:03;"because the weight of history on ""Nevermind"""
01:35:03;01:35:05;"just makes it, you're just less likely"
01:35:05;01:35:06;"to wanna throw it on than you,"
01:35:06;01:35:08;"at least for Jake, you'd want to ""Dirt."""
01:35:08;01:35:10;"And I wonder if you ever feel this way"
01:35:10;01:35:13;"and this might be different than your top Bob albums list."
01:35:13;01:35:18;"I've just found lately, I'd rather listen to ""Shot of Love"""
01:35:18;01:35:20;"and Fidel's ""Knocked Out, Loaded"""
01:35:20;01:35:23;"than any of the classic '60s stuff."
01:35:23;01:35:25;"And I've been feeling that way kind of for a long time."
01:35:25;01:35:27;"I'm sure it'll go back later."
01:35:27;01:35:29;"I'd rather listen to '80s or '90s, Bob,"
01:35:29;01:35:33;"than the objectively more classic,"
01:35:33;01:35:35;"tasteful '60s and '70s stuff."
01:35:35;01:35:36;"You ever feel that way?"
01:35:36;01:35:37;"- Oh, absolutely."
01:35:37;01:35:40;"And that's like what is so great about Bob Dylan"
01:35:40;01:35:45;"is that he has so many albums in his catalog"
01:35:45;01:35:48;"that still feel unclaimed in a way."
01:35:48;01:35:51;"And, you know, like for people like us,"
01:35:51;01:35:54;"""Shot of Love"" or ""Empire Burlesque"""
01:35:54;01:35:58;"or even an album like ""Street Legal"" or something,"
01:35:58;01:36:00;"they feel like classics already,"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"but in the larger scheme of things,"
01:36:02;01:36:04;"they're still under-discussed."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"Whereas an album like ""Blonde on Blonde,"""
01:36:06;01:36:09;"I mean, we've all read-"
01:36:09;01:36:10;"- It's a museum piece."
01:36:10;01:36:13;"- Yeah, we've all, and look, ""Blonde on Blonde,"""
01:36:13;01:36:15;"if I had, you know, to me,"
01:36:15;01:36:17;"that's the greatest album ever made."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"Like, and I will say that."
01:36:19;01:36:20;"- That's your number one?"
01:36:20;01:36:23;"- Yeah, if you're asking me to pick"
01:36:23;01:36:24;"the greatest album of all time,"
01:36:24;01:36:26;"I would say ""Blonde on Blonde."""
01:36:26;01:36:28;"And if you put it on, I would enjoy it."
01:36:28;01:36:32;"Like, I still listen to the classics too,"
01:36:32;01:36:36;"but, you know, when you listen to ""Shot of Love,"""
01:36:36;01:36:39;"there's just not as much like narrative baggage"
01:36:39;01:36:40;"attached to an album like that."
01:36:40;01:36:43;"Like, you don't hear like Grail Marcus's voice"
01:36:43;01:36:47;"in your head commenting on it as you're listening to it."
01:36:47;01:36:48;"And this is true of like other, you know,"
01:36:48;01:36:52;"sort of like canonical, like classic rock people,"
01:36:52;01:36:55;"like someone like Van Morrison, for instance."
01:36:55;01:36:57;"There's like this Grail Marcus book"
01:36:57;01:37:00;"where he writes about all the Van Morrison albums."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"And he's basically, he writes at one point,"
01:37:02;01:37:07;"like every Van Morrison album from like 1980s, 1995,"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"you don't need to listen to those at all."
01:37:09;01:37:12;"Like, they're all basically garbage."
01:37:12;01:37:14;"And I'm like, that's like one of my favorite periods"
01:37:14;01:37:16;"of Van Morrison."
01:37:16;01:37:16;"Like, I love that period."
01:37:16;01:37:19;"♪ Beautiful vision ♪"
01:37:19;01:37:20;"- ""Beautiful Vision."""
01:37:20;01:37:21;"- Yeah."
01:37:21;01:37:25;"- And like, ""Hymns to the Silence,"" ""Common One,"""
01:37:25;01:37:28;"and there's so many just beautiful records from then."
01:37:28;01:37:32;"And, you know, that's one of the very attractive things"
01:37:32;01:37:35;"about these sort of like big time artists"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"is that they have so many albums"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"and they have like entire decades of their career"
01:37:39;01:37:43;"that have been dismissed by experts."
01:37:43;01:37:45;"- It's like, almost like you're getting"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"multiple artists in one."
01:37:47;01:37:48;"- Right."
01:37:48;01:37:48;"- The same way that there might be one person"
01:37:48;01:37:51;"who's like, ""Yeah, I love the Beatles,"
01:37:51;01:37:55;"but then, you know, you also catch me listening"
01:37:55;01:37:57;"to West Coast Experimental Pop Group"
01:37:57;01:38:00;"or whatever, like obscure, weirder '60s stuff."""
01:38:00;01:38:01;"But with Bob Dylan or Van Morrison,"
01:38:01;01:38:04;"it's both are within the same artist."
01:38:04;01:38:05;"You can be like, ""Oh yeah, I'll listen."
01:38:05;01:38:07;"I'll throw Freewheel in on 'Once in a Blue Moon,'"""
01:38:07;01:38:09;"but like, you have this whole decade of them."
01:38:09;01:38:10;"It's almost like being into,"
01:38:10;01:38:13;"even though of course there's so much continuity,"
01:38:13;01:38:16;"to be into it and finding people to talk about it with"
01:38:16;01:38:19;"is almost like being into a semi-obscure artist."
01:38:19;01:38:20;"- Totally."
01:38:20;01:38:22;"- To talk about Empire Burlesque with somebody."
01:38:22;01:38:23;"- Well, I was gonna say,"
01:38:23;01:38:28;"it's like being into historically significant visual artists"
01:38:28;01:38:32;"that have different phases of their career."
01:38:32;01:38:34;"You can say like Picasso."
01:38:34;01:38:36;"The Blue Period is only like five, six years."
01:38:36;01:38:37;"- Right."
01:38:37;01:38:38;"- The work he was doing in the '30s was much different"
01:38:38;01:38:41;"than the work he was doing in the '70s."
01:38:41;01:38:43;"If you wanna go deep, you can."
01:38:43;01:38:43;"- I agree."
01:38:43;01:38:45;"I think there's something interesting though about,"
01:38:45;01:38:48;"'cause I always think of like Tunnel of Love"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"as this like very important,"
01:38:50;01:38:53;"I think when it's music, if you're from a certain era,"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"at some point, that's our nostalgia."
01:38:55;01:38:57;"Like even if it wasn't at the, you know,"
01:38:57;01:39:01;"it somehow connects us very specifically"
01:39:01;01:39:02;"to when we were growing up."
01:39:02;01:39:06;"I mean, my parents listened to Bob Dylan pretty religiously,"
01:39:06;01:39:10;"like, but at some point that '60s, '70s"
01:39:10;01:39:12;"is not my experience at all."
01:39:12;01:39:15;"And even those later albums, which were not on as much,"
01:39:15;01:39:18;"became much more of my childhood."
01:39:18;01:39:20;"- Just 'cause they were new when you came out, they came."
01:39:20;01:39:21;"- Yeah."
01:39:21;01:39:21;"- Yeah, that's cool."
01:39:21;01:39:23;"- And like you'd even hear it on MTV even."
01:39:23;01:39:24;"I mean, there's just something about"
01:39:24;01:39:26;"the connection at this age. - Yeah, watch 'em unplugged."
01:39:26;01:39:27;"- Totally."
01:39:27;01:39:29;"- Oh yeah, I like that, that there's two different ways"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"you can approach like a deep career artist like that."
01:39:31;01:39:33;"You can either start getting into the albums"
01:39:33;01:39:36;"that come out in real time, like when you're,"
01:39:36;01:39:38;"you know, if you're like 17 and 97,"
01:39:38;01:39:40;"like check out Time Out of Mind."
01:39:40;01:39:42;"You can do it that way."
01:39:42;01:39:45;"Or you can kind of just grow up with the records."
01:39:45;01:39:48;"And actually I have a memory of being in college"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"when I definitely was listening to Blonde on Blonde"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"all the time and Highway 61 Revisited,"
01:39:52;01:39:55;"just all like the classic, classic '60s stuff."
01:39:55;01:39:58;"And I remember hanging out with,"
01:39:58;01:40:01;"he's an interesting filmmaker, very talented guy,"
01:40:01;01:40:02;"Eugene Kotularenko."
01:40:02;01:40:03;"- Oh, hell yeah."
01:40:03;01:40:05;"- I went to college with him."
01:40:05;01:40:09;"And I remember being like 19 or 20"
01:40:09;01:40:12;"and him just being like, ""You ever listen to Infidels?"""
01:40:12;01:40:14;"And I was like, ""What is that, like '80s, Bob?"""
01:40:14;01:40:17;"And he was like, ""Oh yeah, you should listen to it."
01:40:17;01:40:18;"Great record."""
01:40:18;01:40:19;"And I just remember at the time being just like,"
01:40:19;01:40:22;"I remember kind of bookmarking it and I was just like,"
01:40:22;01:40:24;"and I think I tried, I was like, I cannot."
01:40:24;01:40:28;"- Eugene was at Infidels head at age 18 or 19."
01:40:28;01:40:29;"- Respect."
01:40:29;01:40:30;"- He's like, ""You gotta listen, there's a song about Israel."
01:40:30;01:40:33;"You're gonna, it's like, it's crazy."""
01:40:33;01:40:35;"And he's like, ""You gotta check it out."""
01:40:35;01:40:37;"But I really have this feeling where I'm like,"
01:40:37;01:40:40;"and you know, when Bob would have been,"
01:40:40;01:40:41;"when Infidels came out,"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"he would have been in his early 40s or something."
01:40:43;01:40:45;"So a little bit older than me."
01:40:45;01:40:47;"I can't even fully put it into words."
01:40:47;01:40:48;"It would be almost be too simple to say,"
01:40:48;01:40:49;"""Well, you know, you grow up,"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"you have more experiences, you relate more."""
01:40:51;01:40:54;"But it's like, I can feel my center of gravity"
01:40:54;01:40:55;"going more towards Infidels."
01:40:55;01:40:56;"There's something about it."
01:40:56;01:40:58;"I just understand it more."
01:40:58;01:41:02;"I feel more comfortable listening to it or something."
01:41:02;01:41:05;"And I really have a feeling."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"Now I've thrown on Tempest, I like it,"
01:41:07;01:41:10;"but I do have a feeling when I'm like old,"
01:41:10;01:41:11;"Tempest will be hitting."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"When I'm Bob's age, when he made Tempest,"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"I think I'll understand something deeper about it."
01:41:15;01:41:17;"I love that, having that too."
01:41:17;01:41:19;"- Yeah, I was just gonna say that."
01:41:19;01:41:21;"I think there is something to be said too"
01:41:21;01:41:25;"about how, you know, we're talking about ""Knocked Out Loaded"""
01:41:25;01:41:29;"and he was like 45 when that record came out"
01:41:29;01:41:31;"and I'm 45 now."
01:41:31;01:41:34;"So I feel like that makes me like that record more"
01:41:34;01:41:37;"because there's something about me being the same age"
01:41:37;01:41:38;"as Bob when he made that record."
01:41:38;01:41:40;"It's like, I kind of understand."
01:41:40;01:41:45;"Although his experience was obviously much different"
01:41:45;01:41:49;"than mine when he was 45 because he had this entire,"
01:41:49;01:41:53;"I mean, he was still having to reckon"
01:41:53;01:41:56;"with his younger self at that point."
01:41:56;01:41:58;"I mean, I feel like he's gotten beyond that now."
01:41:58;01:42:01;"Like where people, certainly people who love Bob Dylan,"
01:42:01;01:42:05;"they're not comparing him to who he was when he was 25."
01:42:05;01:42:08;"But like when he was making records in the 80s,"
01:42:08;01:42:12;"like that was still something he had to react against."
01:42:12;01:42:15;"And it just made those records sound worse,"
01:42:15;01:42:16;"I think, to people at the time."
01:42:16;01:42:18;"Whereas we can listen to those records now"
01:42:18;01:42:21;"and we have the benefit of just appreciating it"
01:42:21;01:42:24;"as like part of an unfolding story, you know?"
01:42:24;01:42:26;"- Yes. - Like where we're not"
01:42:26;01:42:28;"comparing it to what he was in the 60s."
01:42:28;01:42:30;"We can just kind of appreciate like,"
01:42:30;01:42:34;"oh, this is like the flavor of Bob in the 80s, you know?"
01:42:34;01:42:36;"But I gotta say, you know, to go back to Van Morrison,"
01:42:36;01:42:40;"Van Morrison is like, I feel like his legacy is in flux"
01:42:40;01:42:43;"just because he's like a lunatic"
01:42:43;01:42:47;"and he's said a lot of stupid things in recent years."
01:42:47;01:42:51;"His 80s period, I think is the best 80s period"
01:42:51;01:42:54;"of all the 60s like singer-songwriters."
01:42:54;01:42:56;"Like if you're gonna compare him."
01:42:56;01:43:00;"And I love 80s Bob, but like I think 80s Van,"
01:43:00;01:43:03;"that might be my favorite decade for Van."
01:43:03;01:43:06;"- What's your number one song from 80s Van?"
01:43:06;01:43:07;"(inhales)"
01:43:07;01:43:11;"- Man, ""Cleaning Windows"" is a great song."
01:43:11;01:43:12;"- All right, I'm gonna start there."
01:43:12;01:43:13;"- I think that one, I mean, ""Common One,"""
01:43:13;01:43:14;"""Common One"" is great."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"""Summertime in England,"""
01:43:16;01:43:18;"actually ""Summertime in England"" probably"
01:43:18;01:43:22;"from ""Common One"" is a great song."
01:43:22;01:43:23;"- I love the song ""Beautiful Vision."""
01:43:23;01:43:26;"Like, yeah, like the song ""Beautiful Vision,"""
01:43:26;01:43:28;"the song ""Dweller on the Threshold."""
01:43:28;01:43:29;"- I was gonna say ""Dweller on the Threshold,"""
01:43:29;01:43:31;"that's a great song too."
01:43:31;01:43:34;"That album with the Cheapkins he did is really beautiful."
01:43:34;01:43:36;"- Oh yeah, actually, I know that one."
01:43:36;01:43:37;"And I've always loved that,"
01:43:37;01:43:40;"'cause I've always loved that kind of traditional Irish stuff."
01:43:40;01:43:41;"- Actually, I'll say-"
01:43:41;01:43:43;"- We gotta do an 80s Van episode soon."
01:43:43;01:43:47;"- I was gonna say ""In the Garden,"" actually from,"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"""No Guru, No Method, No Teacher,"""
01:43:49;01:43:51;"which is like one of my favorite Van records."
01:43:51;01:43:53;"""In the Garden,"" beautiful song."
01:43:53;01:43:55;"- Okay, all right, I'm starting with ""In the Garden."""
01:43:55;01:43:59;"- Steven's making the time crisis"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"number one live even flows."
01:44:01;01:44:05;"- All right, and 80s Van Morrison."
01:44:05;01:44:09;"- Well, we decided on 25 even flows for Jake, right?"
01:44:09;01:44:10;"- We'll share them with the audience."
01:44:10;01:44:11;"- Top 25 even flows."
01:44:11;01:44:12;"And then with the Van thing,"
01:44:12;01:44:16;"you need to imagine that it's 1994,"
01:44:16;01:44:20;"and Van Morrison is making ""His Greatest Hits,"" volume three"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"at the time, a la Bob."
01:44:22;01:44:24;"And he has to dig into that material,"
01:44:24;01:44:27;"and he has to tell his own idiosyncratic story"
01:44:27;01:44:28;"of what he's been up to."
01:44:28;01:44:31;"And he did have some actual, like, pretty big songs,"
01:44:31;01:44:33;"at least in the late 80s, right?"
01:44:33;01:44:34;"- There's that song, ""Have I Told You Lately,"""
01:44:34;01:44:37;"that, like, Rod Stewart covered."
01:44:37;01:44:39;"- Right, so that became like a,"

01:48:59;01:49:03;"because for my 12 to 17 era, it's kind of true."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"I don't know what, if I was ranking them,"
01:49:05;01:49:07;"if I'd put them top, but of course,"
01:49:07;01:49:08;"oh wait, I'm blanking."
01:49:08;01:49:10;"What, Californication, what's that album called?"
01:49:10;01:49:11;"- Yeah, that's it."
01:49:11;01:49:13;"- Yeah, it's Californication."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"I thought that was great when it came out."
01:49:15;01:49:18;"But I also have a really soft spot for By The Way."
01:49:18;01:49:18;"- Right."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"- I remember even at the time being kind of like,"
01:49:20;01:49:23;"wow, strong followup."
01:49:23;01:49:25;"There are some really good songs on it."
01:49:25;01:49:26;"All right, let's keep moving."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"I mean, that's just some classic Red Hot Chili Peppers."
01:49:28;01:49:30;"You know what, it's funny,"
01:49:30;01:49:31;"Colin, another producer on the show,"
01:49:31;01:49:33;"emailed us about this song a while ago."
01:49:33;01:49:34;"I guess it's doing pretty well."
01:49:34;01:49:36;"This is Dirty Heads."
01:49:36;01:49:38;"I don't know how much you guys know about them."
01:49:38;01:49:40;"I associate them with like slightly stupid,"
01:49:40;01:49:45;"kind of like Southern California, reggae-ish."
01:49:45;01:49:46;"Jam band adjacent, right?"
01:49:46;01:49:47;"Is that fair?"
01:49:47;01:49:50;"Steven, are they jam band adjacent?"
01:49:50;01:49:50;"- Dirty Heads?"
01:49:50;01:49:52;"- Are they outside your beat?"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"- I mean, I don't go deep on Dirty Heads,"
01:49:54;01:49:57;"but like the slightly stupid reference"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"makes me feel like you're probably right."
01:49:59;01:50:03;"'Cause slightly stupid would be definitely jam band adjacent."
01:50:03;01:50:05;"- They're blowing out Red Rocks."
01:50:05;01:50:06;"- Yeah."
01:50:06;01:50:09;"- They got a bit of like a follow, you know."
01:50:09;01:50:10;"- Any kind of like-- - A little show to show."
01:50:10;01:50:12;"- Yeah, like lightly reggae stuff."
01:50:12;01:50:15;"Like you're gonna have some jam band people"
01:50:15;01:50:16;"in there for sure."
01:50:16;01:50:18;"- Well, you guys are gonna like this,"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"like Jake's gonna love this."
01:50:20;01:50:23;"This is Dirty Heads with their hit cover."
01:50:23;01:50:25;"I think it's fair to say it's number three"
01:50:25;01:50:26;"on the Alternative Airplay chart."
01:50:26;01:50:30;"This is their hit cover of Joe Walsh's ""Life's Been Good."""
01:50:30;01:50:31;"- Oh no."
01:50:31;01:50:32;"- Wow."
01:50:34;01:50:35;"- Oh no."
01:50:35;01:50:39;"- Steven, what are you drinking there?"
01:50:39;01:50:42;"- Just water, water and coffee."
01:50:42;01:50:43;"- Coffee?"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"- Yeah."
01:50:45;01:50:45;"- What is it?"
01:50:45;01:50:47;"- Are you in Japan too, Steven?"
01:50:47;01:50:50;"(laughing)"
01:50:50;01:50:52;"- I had another interview before this."
01:50:52;01:50:53;"- Wow."
01:50:53;01:50:54;"- Such."
01:50:54;01:50:55;"- Wow."
01:50:55;01:50:57;"Coffee at home at nine at night."
01:50:57;01:50:59;"- I know, I might be paying for it later."
01:50:59;01:51:00;"Hopefully not so much."
01:51:00;01:51:01;"- Some people can just do it."
01:51:01;01:51:02;"That sucks."
01:51:02;01:51:05;"- This is honestly, ""Life's Been Good"""
01:51:05;01:51:07;"is like one of my favorite songs of all time."
01:51:07;01:51:11;"I think the lyrics of the song are brilliant."
01:51:11;01:51:12;"Like every lyric is very quotable."
01:51:12;01:51:13;"- It's a great song."
01:51:13;01:51:17;"- And this cover of it just makes me,"

01:51:31;01:51:32;"- Of course."
01:51:32;01:51:33;"- And there's no irony here at all."
01:51:33;01:51:36;"It just feels like it's total bro rock."

01:51:50;01:51:53;"Okay, but I didn't, yeah, but they're rapping about,"

01:52:01;01:52:02;"- It just makes you like wonder,"
01:52:02;01:52:05;"like what is the alternative audience in 2022?"
01:52:05;01:52:07;"Because you talk about,"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"alternative was always like a weird term in the '90s,"
01:52:09;01:52:12;"but you felt like there was some unifying aesthetic"
01:52:12;01:52:14;"that defined what it was."
01:52:14;01:52:16;"And I don't know what this aesthetic is."
01:52:16;01:52:17;"- Now it's truly bizarre."
01:52:17;01:52:21;"And I mean, it's only gonna get more bizarre"

01:52:24;01:52:28;"I mean, I do understand how they're alternative,"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"but they also are in a sense,"

01:52:34;01:52:36;"Let's see what this one sounds like."

01:52:37;01:52:40;"Steve, are you an ""Imagine Dragons"" defender?"
01:52:40;01:52:41;"- I'm not a defender necessarily."
01:52:41;01:52:43;"I was just gonna shout out"
01:52:43;01:52:46;"a old school ""Time Crisis"" episode."
01:52:46;01:52:48;"I think that's like one of the great episodes"
01:52:48;01:52:51;"in the catalog where you talk about"
01:52:51;01:52:54;"""Imagine Dragons"" in the 1975."
01:52:54;01:52:55;"- Oh, right."
01:52:55;01:52:57;"The singer from 1975 was hating on them."
01:52:57;01:53:00;"- Yeah, that's a great riff."

01:53:12;01:53:15;"and where they fit in the world."
01:53:15;01:53:17;"And Dan Reynolds, lead singer,"
01:53:17;01:53:22;"seems like he's a legitimately positive guy."
01:53:22;01:53:23;"- Dude."
01:53:23;01:53:23;"- Yeah, like a positive good force."
01:53:23;01:53:26;"- And there's something too where it's like,"

01:53:33;01:53:36;"I do think though, if you could take a step back,"

01:53:42;01:53:43;"I've just always had that vibe off them."
01:53:43;01:53:45;"It's like, they're doing it right."
01:53:45;01:53:47;"They seem like a likely candidate for a band"
01:53:47;01:53:50;"that in 10 or 20 years, somebody with no baggage"
01:53:50;01:53:52;"could go back and like, you know,"

01:53:59;01:54:03;"and it's a timeout and Radioactive comes on,"
01:54:03;01:54:05;"you're gonna probably enjoy it."
01:54:05;01:54:08;"You know, it's like a good song for that environment."
01:54:08;01:54:11;"It's jock jams type music."
01:54:11;01:54:12;"- And they have a lot of them."
01:54:12;01:54:13;"- Exactly. - They got a lot of those songs."
01:54:13;01:54:17;"- Where if I'm just hanging out in my office,"
01:54:17;01:54:18;"I'm not gonna put it on,"

01:54:20;01:54:22;"I'm not gonna hate it."
01:54:22;01:54:22;"- Right."
01:54:22;01:54:24;"- Yeah, that's a good point."
01:54:24;01:54:27;"- I'm psyched in 20 years when our kids start a band"
01:54:27;01:54:29;"and the major touchstone is ""Imagine Dragons."""
01:54:29;01:54:32;"- Well, you know, I will say one of the things that maybe--"
01:54:32;01:54:33;"- Come on guys, no GBV?"
01:54:33;01:54:36;"- One of the things that made me appreciate Radioactive"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"is that years ago I was in my hometown"
01:54:38;01:54:42;"and we were at this like church picnic"
01:54:42;01:54:45;"and there was a teenage band on stage"
01:54:45;01:54:49;"and they played Radioactive and it was very charming."
01:54:49;01:54:50;"That was probably one of the first songs"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"they ever learned to play and I was like,"
01:54:52;01:54:54;"okay, I actually kind of like this song now"
01:54:54;01:54:55;"'cause I saw 14 year olds playing it."
01:54:55;01:54:56;"- I can see that sounding great,"
01:54:56;01:54:58;"just like kind of a garage band."
01:54:58;01:55:00;"♪ Radioactive ♪"
01:55:00;01:55:04;"- And they had this like teenage girl lead singer"
01:55:04;01:55:06;"and she was singing it kind of off key,"
01:55:06;01:55:07;"but it was great."
01:55:07;01:55:11;"It was like the best possible version of that song."
01:55:11;01:55:14;"So, yeah, exactly."
01:55:14;01:55:15;"- There's definitely something to it."
01:55:15;01:55:18;"Okay, and then the number one, I guess in a way,"
01:55:18;01:55:20;"the number one song is by The Killers."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"It's a new song called ""Boy."""
