00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:06;"There's a lot of things we thought we might talk about today,"
00:06;00:08;"but we didn't get to them,"
00:08;00:10;"because we went deep."
00:10;00:12;"On Oasis,"
00:12;00:14;"The Black Crows,"
00:14;00:16;"Falco,"
00:16;00:18;"and the end of history,"
00:18;00:22;"this is a very special Time Crisis."
00:22;00:25;"And a little Grateful Dead and Talking Heads too."
00:25;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:35;00:38;"They passed me by,"
00:38;00:41;"all of those great romances."
00:41;00:45;"They were a palpably,"
00:45;00:48;"all my rightful chances."
00:48;00:51;"My picture clear,"
00:51;00:56;"everything seemed so easy."
00:56;00:59;"And so I dealt to the blow,"
00:59;01:02;"when a bus had to go."
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:07;01:10;"One of us is crying,"
01:10;01:13;"one of us is lying."
01:13;01:17;"Even only they."
01:17;01:19;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:19;01:22;"Nick just commented I look pretty Euro,"
01:22;01:24;"on the FaceTime."
01:24;01:26;"Tracksuit and Estella, it's just a different..."
01:26;01:29;"Ironically, I was trying to be all American,"
01:29;01:32;"because I wanted to wear a light jacket,"
01:32;01:35;"so I grabbed one of the sportier things I have."
01:35;01:39;"You know, like a classical American person."
01:39;01:42;"And it just so happens I have this,"
01:42;01:45;"Venetia FC track jacket,"
01:45;01:47;"that was gifted to me,"
01:47;01:50;"by somebody involved in the club."
01:50;01:52;"And then I wanted to drink a beer,"
01:52;01:53;"like an all American,"
01:53;01:55;"just happened that the only beer we had in the fridge,"
01:55;01:57;"were some Estella Artois."
01:57;01:59;"I think you look like, what I imagine,"
01:59;02:02;"Noel Gallagher's best friend/handler,"
02:02;02:05;"to appear like."
02:05;02:07;"Full tracksuit at all times."
02:07;02:09;"Is Noel sober now?"
02:09;02:11;"Are the Gallagher brothers sober?"
02:11;02:13;"I don't think so."
02:13;02:15;"I always get confused, Noel is the older brother."
02:15;02:16;"He's the songwriter."
02:16;02:18;"Oh yeah, I love him."
02:18;02:20;"Liam is sober."
02:20;02:22;"Yeah, I thought, okay."
02:22;02:25;"If one of them is sober, I would imagine the other isn't."
02:25;02:27;"Have we ever gone deep on Oasis?"
02:27;02:29;"No, we never have."
02:29;02:32;"That's really not the plan for this episode, but."
02:32;02:33;"You know, it's funny,"
02:33;02:35;"I don't think I talked about it on the show, but,"
02:35;02:39;"last year, somewhere in the middle of COVID,"
02:39;02:41;"I got really into watching,"
02:41;02:43;"like, really long,"
02:43;02:45;"Noel Gallagher interviews."
02:45;02:48;"And, you know, I always liked Oasis."
02:48;02:50;"I met Noel once, partied with him."
02:50;02:52;"Do tell, partied with him."
02:52;02:53;"Well, whatever, it was just like,"
02:53;02:56;"it was like at a hotel or something, people were drinking."
02:56;02:58;"Just chatted with him a bit."
02:58;03:00;"I thought he was a very nice and charming guy."
03:00;03:02;"Yeah, I've always liked Oasis, and, you know,"
03:02;03:04;"like, on Time Crisis,"
03:04;03:07;"obviously I've made it my mission to try to,"
03:07;03:10;"you know, never s*** talk fellow musicians."
03:10;03:12;"You never know what's going on with somebody else."
03:12;03:15;"You know, try not to be too cruel,"
03:15;03:16;"even if you don't like their music,"
03:16;03:18;"or you got an issue with them."
03:18;03:22;"I think you said once that s*** talk does not age well."
03:22;03:25;"And I've thought about that a lot since."
03:25;03:27;"That's a lesson that stuck with me."
03:27;03:28;"Oh, really?"
03:28;03:30;"I wonder if I'm right."
03:30;03:32;"Well, and also, the first thing that I think of"
03:32;03:35;"when I hear that again,"
03:35;03:37;"is also, like, even outside of, like,"
03:37;03:39;"the good bands talking s*** about each other,"
03:39;03:43;"even if you pick, like, an objectively cool person,"
03:43;03:45;"and then pick an objectively uncool person,"
03:45;03:47;"and, you know, people might take issue"
03:47;03:49;"that there's no such thing as objectively cool."
03:49;03:51;"But let's say a classically cool person"
03:51;03:53;"is a classically uncool person,"
03:53;03:55;"even that doesn't age well."
03:55;03:57;"Wait, do you mean that the classically uncool person"
03:57;03:58;"is s*** talking?"
03:58;04:00;"No, no, I mean the classically cool."
04:00;04:02;"I mean where the person might be right."
04:02;04:04;"Lou Reed is s*** talking on, like,"
04:04;04:06;"the guys in, like, Emerson, Lake, and Palmer."
04:06;04:08;"Or, like, Rush."
04:08;04:10;"[laughs]"
04:10;04:12;"I mean, yeah, yeah, for instance."
04:12;04:13;"That just cracks me up, just like..."
04:13;04:14;"Yeah, you could totally..."
04:14;04:16;"Well, Lou Reed also is such a..."
04:16;04:18;"He was an iconic, like, s*** talking,"
04:18;04:22;"angry guy, alienating figure to a lot of people."
04:22;04:26;"But yeah, of course Lou Reed is cooler than Rush."
04:26;04:28;"But for instance, yeah, if you, like,"
04:28;04:29;"with all this distance..."
04:29;04:31;"Who had more hits?"
04:31;04:32;"Rush?"
04:32;04:34;"Well, yeah."
04:34;04:35;"Who sold more records?"
04:35;04:36;"Definitely Rush."
04:36;04:38;"Who could shred harder?"
04:38;04:39;"[laughs]"
04:39;04:40;"Rush."
04:40;04:43;"Who was filling arenas 30 years"
04:43;04:45;"after a local Ohio radio station"
04:45;04:49;"first broke their single ""Working Man""?"
04:49;04:50;"It's Rush!"
04:50;04:51;"Like, picture even, like,"
04:51;04:54;"peak cool Lou Reed just being like,"
04:54;04:56;"""Man, I heard this Rush album."
04:56;04:59;"I mean, Neil Peart, man, his lyrics are trash."
04:59;05:00;"Stick to the drums."""
05:00;05:02;"Whatever he might say,"
05:02;05:04;"it wouldn't age well."
05:04;05:05;"It's just not cool."
05:05;05:06;"You know what I mean?"
05:06;05:07;"Like, especially looking back and be like,"
05:07;05:09;"they all had something to offer."
05:09;05:10;"Yeah."
05:10;05:12;"Well, I have to say,"
05:12;05:15;"that was one thing that kind of turned me off"
05:15;05:17;"on Oasis when I was younger."
05:17;05:19;"When they had their big hits in the '90s,"
05:19;05:21;"I liked their hits."
05:21;05:23;"""Wonderwall,"" ""Don't Look Back in Anger."""
05:23;05:25;"I was like, ""These are good songs."""
05:25;05:27;"And then the fact that they were so aggro"
05:27;05:28;"about crapping on every other band."
05:28;05:29;"Yeah."
05:29;05:31;"I was like, ""You know what?"
05:31;05:33;"I think that's coming from a place of insecurity, guys."""
05:33;05:35;"Like, listen, you like the Beatles."
05:35;05:36;"I like the Beatles."
05:36;05:37;"We all like the Beatles."
05:37;05:39;"You guys are doing, like, a Beatles thing."
05:39;05:41;"Like, a kind of late Beatles thing."
05:41;05:42;"Great."
05:42;05:44;"But the fact that they were so aggro"
05:44;05:46;"about that and other bands"
05:46;05:48;"and them just being like,"
05:48;05:49;"""If we had existed in the '60s,"
05:49;05:51;"we would have been just as big as the Beatles."""
05:51;05:52;"Probably true."
05:52;05:54;"But just sort of like a moot point."
05:54;05:56;"It would have been pretty confusing."
05:56;05:58;"A dumb hypothetical."
05:58;06:00;"I was always just like, ""Guys,"
06:00;06:01;"you're obviously insecure"
06:01;06:03;"that you don't have an original vision."""
06:03;06:05;"And it's showing."
06:05;06:06;"Well, totally."
06:06;06:07;"And that's what I was getting to,"
06:07;06:09;"is that I had the exact same feeling as you"
06:09;06:12;"because I don't like s***talkers."
06:12;06:13;"I've always been on record."
06:13;06:15;"I try to avoid it in my life, you know?"
06:15;06:18;"Like, give people the benefit of the doubt, you know?"
06:18;06:20;"Like, be nice whenever possible."
06:20;06:22;"And there was something about the"
06:22;06:24;"always just seeing these headlines"
06:24;06:25;"of Noel Gallagher talking s***"
06:25;06:27;"about just about everybody."
06:27;06:29;"And I think he often crossed the line."
06:29;06:31;"But as I went deeper on some of these interviews,"
06:31;06:34;"I was watching, like, an unedited, like,"
06:34;06:36;"interview in Japan in, like,"
06:36;06:38;"I don't know when this was, like, 2001."
06:38;06:41;"Like, 53 minutes uncut."
06:41;06:42;"And just kind of, like, feeling like"
06:42;06:45;"I was starting to get to know the guy a little better."
06:45;06:47;"I really started to develop a sense,"
06:47;06:49;"and I don't think this is a very original thought,"
06:49;06:51;"but I really started to get a sense"
06:51;06:53;"that he's not arrogant."
06:53;06:56;"Like, it's kind of just like some wrestling s***."
06:56;06:58;"He's, like, this funny Manchester dude."
06:58;06:59;"He's taking the s***."
07:00;07:02;"And if anything,"
07:02;07:05;"I think he could credibly make a case."
07:05;07:06;"'Cause some people talk s***"
07:06;07:08;"just because they're terrible,"
07:08;07:10;"mean-spirited, petty people"
07:10;07:11;"with a chip on their shoulder"
07:11;07:13;"and want to take other people down."
07:13;07:14;"Of course that exists."
07:14;07:17;"I think Noel Gallagher could credibly make the case"
07:17;07:18;"that he's trying to just, like,"
07:18;07:22;"stir s*** up for the good of the community."
07:22;07:23;"Kind of."
07:23;07:24;"Like, I started to get this vibe"
07:24;07:25;"watching all these long interviews"
07:25;07:28;"that it's a dude who is a music nerd,"
07:28;07:31;"knows his, like, music history inside and out,"
07:31;07:33;"worships the greats,"
07:33;07:35;"the Smiths, the Beatles, whoever,"
07:35;07:38;"and deeply wants or wanted--"
07:38;07:40;"he probably gave up by now--"
07:40;07:43;"he deeply wanted rock music to be more interesting"
07:43;07:45;"and full of, like, the big characters"
07:45;07:48;"that he was familiar with from his youth."
07:48;07:50;"I'm willing to believe that when he would s***"
07:50;07:52;"on, like, Radiohead or Sonic Youth,"
07:52;07:54;"which are, like, two--"
07:54;07:55;"it's just so funny, like,"
07:55;07:58;"just being like, ""What is this s***?"""
07:58;07:59;"""Come on, guys."""
07:59;08:00;"He's droning."
08:00;08:03;"That he really was coming from a place of almost, like--"
08:03;08:04;"I bet he deep down--"
08:04;08:05;"I don't know if he respected Sonic Youth,"
08:05;08:06;"but I think he--"
08:06;08:07;"I'm sure he respected Radiohead"
08:07;08:09;"because, you know, he's a songwriter."
08:09;08:10;"There's no way that he doesn't respect"
08:10;08:12;"the great Radiohead songs."
08:12;08:13;"He wanted them to be more like him."
08:13;08:16;"He, like, wants them to talk more s*** and stuff."
08:16;08:18;"Like, I truly believe that he thought"
08:18;08:19;"that'd be for the good of everybody"
08:19;08:21;"if things were a little more fun,"
08:21;08:24;"a little more WWE vibe."
08:24;08:25;"I love this generous read."
08:25;08:26;"It's a great read."
08:26;08:29;"Yeah, I'm sure I could be dissuaded from it,"
08:29;08:31;"but, like, I just really got this feeling"
08:31;08:33;"that he wasn't as arrogant as he seemed"
08:33;08:34;"'cause he would really, like,"
08:34;08:37;"take the s*** out of Oasis and himself."
08:37;08:38;"Like, there's one--"
08:38;08:40;"I feel like I saved it on my phone."
08:40;08:41;"Let me see if I have it."
08:41;08:44;"I was taking, like, little videos of, like, the TV."
08:44;08:46;"While Ezra finds this,"
08:46;08:47;"I was making that joke, obviously."
08:47;08:49;"They famously hate each other,"
08:49;08:50;"him and his brother."
08:50;08:54;"And when I said that Liam was sober,"
08:54;08:55;"I made that joke that, obviously,"
08:55;08:57;"Noel must be a drinker."
08:57;09:02;"The first article that comes up in the Daily Mail"
09:02;09:04;"is that Noel Gallagher admits"
09:04;09:06;"that he has ignored instructions not to panic buy"
09:06;09:09;"as he stockpiles alcohol for coronavirus."
09:09;09:11;"So not only is he not sober--"
09:11;09:13;"He literally started drinking more"
09:13;09:14;"when his brother got sober."
09:14;09:15;"He started drinking more"
09:15;09:16;"when he found out his brother was sober."
09:16;09:17;"Oh, wait, I--"
09:17;09:19;"Despite drinking."
09:19;09:20;"Amazing."
09:20;09:22;"Very healthy, despite drinking."
09:22;09:24;"I'm gonna play this into the mic."
09:24;09:25;"See, but then, like,"
09:25;09:27;"it's the thing that I don't understand."
09:27;09:28;"You know, like,"
09:28;09:31;"when, uh, when radio went,"
09:31;09:34;"put the little bit of sexy Sadie in ""Karma Police,"""
09:34;09:37;"um, everybody says that, you know, he's a genius."
09:37;09:39;"And when I put a little bit of Dave Prudence"
09:39;09:40;"in ""Who Feels Love,"""
09:40;09:41;"it's called pastiche, you know what I mean?"
09:41;09:43;"It's so--"
09:43;09:45;"People just don't [bleep] like me anymore."
09:45;09:46;"I've done some--"
09:47;09:48;"And I can't quite work out what it is,"
09:48;09:50;"but there you go."
09:50;09:51;"Did you hear what he was saying?"
09:51;09:53;"Yeah, he said when he--"
09:53;09:56;"when radio had put a little bit of what in ""Karma Police""?"
09:56;09:57;"A little bit of sexy Sadie."
09:57;09:58;"-Oh, okay. -Which they did."
09:58;09:59;"And he did a little--"
09:59;10:00;"-Yeah, he said-- -Right."
10:00;10:02;"Whatever he says, he says, ""They're geniuses."""
10:02;10:03;"I put a little bit of Dave Prudence"
10:03;10:05;"in some Oasis song, I don't know."
10:05;10:06;"It's pastiche."
10:06;10:08;"He does also have that funny--"
10:08;10:10;"which is so classically English,"
10:10;10:13;"like, the very intelligent working-class guy"
10:13;10:15;"who, like, plays up both sides"
10:15;10:17;"when he wants to be, like,"
10:17;10:19;"""Oh, me? Yeah, I'm just a regular-ass guy."""
10:19;10:20;"But then he also, like,"
10:20;10:22;"he knows [bleep] as well as anybody,"
10:22;10:23;"and he, like, drops it in a bit."
10:23;10:25;"And then at the end, he goes,"
10:25;10:26;"""Yeah, I don't know why."
10:26;10:28;"They just don't [bleep] like me."""
10:28;10:29;"It's a little Trump, too."
10:29;10:30;"Oh, yeah."
10:30;10:31;"We don't have to take it political,"
10:31;10:32;"but, you know, obviously,"
10:32;10:35;"Trump looms large as, like, a type of person."
10:35;10:37;"He does sometimes have that funny vibe"
10:37;10:38;"of just being like,"
10:38;10:39;"""I don't know. They just don't [bleep] like me."""
10:39;10:42;"You kind of get this impression that he's not actually--"
10:42;10:44;"and this is where he differs from Trump--"
10:44;10:46;"that he actually has a sense of humor"
10:46;10:47;"about people not liking him."
10:47;10:49;"-Oh, absolutely. -Listen to this clip."
10:49;11:08;"[video playing]"
11:08;11:10;"-There's something funny-- -I love him."
11:10;11:12;"Yeah, I started to love him with those quotes,"
11:12;11:14;"just, like, picturing him doing an interview in Japan,"
11:14;11:16;"like, early 2000s."
11:16;11:18;"He's, like, in his mid-30s,"
11:18;11:20;"and he's just, like, feeling kind of frustrated"
11:20;11:22;"and just going like, ""I'm a man."
11:22;11:24;"I'm not a boy no more."""
11:24;11:27;"Just that line, like, the way it rolls off the tongue is great."
11:27;11:30;"And then just, like, again, not exactly arrogant,"
11:30;11:32;"just being like, ""I was great."
11:32;11:35;"Might be great again. Who knows?"
11:35;11:37;"I'm good at what I do. Let's leave it."""
11:37;11:39;"Just, like, thinking out loud, just being kind of like--"
11:39;11:41;"Like, he knows that their first two albums"
11:41;11:43;"are, like, stone-cold classics."
11:43;11:46;"Three and four get into some weirder territory."
11:46;11:48;"And he's just, like, kind of there being like,"
11:48;11:49;"""Yeah, I don't know."""
11:49;11:52;"There was just something about it that actually felt very honest."
11:52;11:54;"It didn't feel-- It made me realize"
11:54;11:57;"that there's this other dimension to the sh---talking."
11:57;11:59;"And I found it kind of charming."
11:59;12:01;"Because if the same person who's out there just sh---talking,"
12:01;12:03;"stirring stuff up, never breaks,"

12:14;12:16;"He takes the sh-- out of himself a bit."
12:16;12:19;"Yeah, I think my first response to them"
12:19;12:21;"was, like, when I was, like, 18,"
12:21;12:24;"in, like, the mid-'90s, and I didn't have--"
12:24;12:26;"I don't know, yeah, the long view"
12:26;12:29;"or the nuanced sort of understanding."
12:29;12:31;"So I just took them very seriously"
12:31;12:33;"and literally what they were saying."
12:33;12:35;"It's definitely, like, struck me over the years"
12:35;12:37;"as, like, more and more funny"
12:37;12:39;"and less and less serious."

13:35;13:37;"Oh, yeah, the Scottish power pop band."
13:37;13:39;"Yeah, and they were, like, recording"
13:39;13:41;"at some... maybe, like, you know,"
13:41;13:43;"like, one of the big studios in London or something."
13:43;13:45;"And then, next door was Oasis,"
13:45;13:47;"and they were just like, ""Oh, my God, what is this gonna be like?"""
13:47;13:49;"And then Oasis popped out, and they were just, like,"
13:49;13:51;"the hugest Teenage Fan Club fans."
13:51;13:53;"And then you're sort of like, ""Oh, I can kind of see that."
13:53;13:55;"I can kind of..."" Yeah, yeah, yeah."
13:55;13:57;"Or they were just being nice to their face."
13:57;13:59;"But it seemed like it was... from the interview,"
13:59;14:00;"it seemed, like, very genuine."
14:00;14:02;"Oh, yeah, I could totally believe that."
14:02;14:04;"Just being deep. Yeah."
14:04;14:06;"Deep in a Teenage Fan Club and, like..."
14:06;14:07;"Deep into Stone Roses."
14:07;14:09;"Oh, definitely."
14:09;14:11;"He just didn't like the arty stuff."
14:11;14:13;"He loved the Beatles. He, like... maybe he likes the middle ground."
14:13;14:15;"I also like that, um..."
14:15;14:17;"if anybody's ever seen that"
14:17;14:19;"really good documentary that came out"
14:19;14:21;"a few years ago about them,"
14:21;14:23;"Noel, before they started the band,"
14:23;14:25;"he also just worked on the road crew"
14:25;14:27;"for Inspiral Carpets,"
14:27;14:29;"who was, like, a Manchester band"
14:29;14:31;"that kind of, like, was"
14:31;14:33;"big-ish in the late '80s, early '90s."
14:33;14:35;"Oh, wow, I didn't know that."
14:35;14:37;"Yeah, they were kind of, like, part of the same"
14:37;14:39;"wave as, like,"
14:39;14:41;"Happy Mondays and stuff. But there's also"
14:41;14:43;"just something about it where I was just, like..."
14:43;14:45;"I guess also the fact that he worked"
14:45;14:47;"on another band's crew for a while"
14:47;14:49;"also just, like, endeared me to him."
14:49;14:51;"I was just kind of like, ""All right."""
14:51;14:53;"He, like... maybe he feels like, ""You know what? I worked my way up."""
14:53;14:55;"Like, when you said ""road crew"""
14:55;14:57;"initially, I thought you meant, like, he worked on a literal, like,"
14:57;14:59;"road crew doing, like, construction."
14:59;15:01;"[laughs] Yeah, I mean..."
15:01;15:03;"Which also would not have surprised me."
15:03;15:05;"I would have never even thought of that."
15:05;15:07;"Man, I have a visceral memory of"
15:07;15:09;"hearing ""Don't Look Back in Anger"" for the first time"
15:09;15:11;"when it was a single"
15:11;15:13;"in, like, '95 or '96 or whatever."
15:13;15:15;"So, at that point, I would have been"
15:15;15:17;"18 or 19, and I didn't know, like,"
15:17;15:19;"all the Beatles' solo albums at that point."
15:19;15:21;"I remember thinking,"
15:21;15:23;"""Oh, is this, like, a George Harrison"
15:23;15:25;"solo cut that I've never heard?"""
15:25;15:27;"Yeah. It's a great song,"
15:27;15:29;"and it's so triumphant."
15:29;15:31;"And the recording was, like..."
15:31;15:33;"I feel like I was pretty tapped in at that point on, like,"
15:33;15:35;"the subtle nuances and, like, recording."
15:35;15:37;"Uh-huh. Or maybe not so subtle"
15:37;15:39;"recording, sort of production techniques,"
15:39;15:41;"you know, across the decades."
15:41;15:43;"And I literally thought it was, like, a lost song"
15:43;15:45;"from the '70s. I could see that."
15:45;15:47;"That song in particular."
15:47;15:49;"Yeah, it had, like, a good attention to detail."
15:49;15:51;"And also, it is funny, too,"
15:51;15:53;"that it's, like, you know, in the UK,"
15:53;15:55;"Oasis..."
15:55;15:57;"You know, in the US, people..."
15:57;15:59;"the average person knows, like,"
15:59;16:01;"two, maybe three Oasis songs."
16:01;16:03;"There's a few hits that loom large."
16:03;16:05;"Yeah. Whereas in the UK, they have, like,"
16:05;16:07;"like, 15"
16:07;16:09;"all-time smash classics."
16:09;16:11;"And obviously, their story..."
16:11;16:13;"Everybody knows the ins and outs of their story"
16:13;16:15;"and the brothers and after the band."
16:15;16:17;"And they're also part of, like,"
16:17;16:19;"the Oasis versus Blur"
16:19;16:21;"and Britpop and the history of Manchester."
16:21;16:23;"There's just, like, so much context"
16:23;16:25;"for Oasis being, like,"
16:25;16:27;"the band of the '90s. And I feel like"
16:27;16:29;"I have kind of a similar memory"
16:29;16:31;"of, like, hearing that song on, like,"
16:31;16:33;"the radio in the '90s"
16:33;16:35;"and just also having this sense of just, like,"
16:35;16:37;"""Wait, where is this from?"""
16:37;16:39;"Oasis was, like, randomly really big"
16:39;16:41;"in America for essentially"
16:41;16:43;"one album. It did feel"
16:43;16:45;"like just, like, this weird"
16:45;16:47;"breakthrough from the UK. Like,"
16:47;16:49;"zero context and then, like,"
16:49;16:51;"kind of went back to just being a British band again."
16:51;16:53;"Matt sent this great"
16:53;16:55;"interview with Tom DeLonge from"
16:55;16:57;"Blink-182 giving this anecdote"
16:57;16:59;"about Liam Gallagher coming up"
16:59;17:01;"to him after a show where they"
17:01;17:03;"were on the same bill. And he says,"
17:03;17:05;"""You're the best I've seen in America."""
17:05;17:07;"And I go, ""You"
17:07;17:09;"like us?"" And he goes, ""I didn't say that,"
17:09;17:11;"but you're the best I've seen in America."""
17:11;17:13;"And then he slammed the door."
17:13;17:15;"That's Liam Gallagher? Oh my god."
17:15;17:17;"Yeah, Liam. I didn't say that."
17:17;17:19;"They're the best. They're the best. I didn't say that."
17:19;17:21;"That's so funny. And also, back"
17:21;17:23;"to, like, the sh*t-talking concept, like,"
17:23;17:25;"of course, it's always kinder not"
17:25;17:27;"to. I get the impression,"
17:27;17:29;"and again, I could be wrong, of, like,"
17:29;17:31;"those dudes, that it's, like,"
17:31;17:33;"the type of dudes who would"
17:33;17:35;"f*ck the talk, abandon the press,"
17:35;17:37;"just to keep things interesting, and then"
17:37;17:39;"actually be, like, really nice behind the scenes"
17:39;17:41;"because people are people, and,"
17:41;17:43;"you know? They actually have some"
17:43;17:45;"generosity of spirit"
17:45;17:47;"versus the opposite, which, you know,"
17:47;17:49;"is maybe more like the Hollywood,"
17:49;17:51;"like, weird American version"
17:51;17:53;"of just, like, the type of person"
17:53;17:55;"who would, like, maybe say something really"
17:55;17:57;"nice publicly, but"
17:57;17:59;"then be, like, incapable of, like,"
17:59;18:01;"connecting on a human level"
18:01;18:03;"because they are just"
18:03;18:05;"too, like, they don't have generosity"
18:05;18:07;"of spirit. So, obviously, those are"
18:07;18:09;"two extremes you don't really"
18:09;18:11;"need to do either, but"
18:11;18:13;"I think Oasis is a little more"
18:13;18:15;"the other one. And you gotta"
18:15;18:17;"give it up for Oasis. Just, like,"
18:17;18:19;"very durable hits."
18:19;18:21;"I would be happy to hear"

21:22;21:25;"where, like, one of the dudes in Black Girls"

22:56;22:58;"Very in the mix."

24:12;24:14;"for breast cancer awareness."
24:14;24:15;"So they shared the same stage."
24:15;24:16;"What?"
24:16;24:17;"Deep."
24:17;24:18;"Wait, what year was that?"
24:18;24:20;"2015."
24:20;24:21;"It's called ""Boobs""?"
24:21;24:22;"It's called--"
24:22;24:23;"It's ""Boobs"" plural?"
24:23;24:25;"""Boob Spelled Backwards is Boob."""
24:25;24:26;"Okay, right."
24:26;24:27;"'Cause that's actually true."
24:27;24:28;"Oh, it's a new ode."
24:28;24:30;"It's a new ode."
24:30;24:31;"So it happened to have been penned--"
24:31;24:32;"Okay, here we go."
24:32;24:34;"Penned by auspicious 8-year-old"
24:34;24:36;"Archer Nelson in direct--"
24:36;24:37;"This is insane."
24:37;24:39;"In direct response to the diagnosis"
24:39;24:41;"of his mother with breast cancer,"
24:41;24:42;"a tender little diddy,"
24:42;24:44;"""Boobs Spelled Backwards is Boob,"""
24:44;24:46;"pulls assuredly at the heartstrings."
24:46;24:47;"The teardrop acts as a love letter"
24:47;24:48;"and encouragement."
24:48;24:50;"So an 8-year-old who had found out"
24:50;24:51;"his mom was diagnosed with breast cancer"
24:51;24:52;"writes this song,"
24:52;24:56;"and then Florence Welch, Noel Gallagher,"
24:56;24:57;"and Phil Esch and Bill Grudson"
24:57;24:59;"perform it on stage."
24:59;25:01;"It is sweet, but it definitely means"
25:01;25:04;"that the hatred can't be that deep."
25:04;25:08;"Phil Esch has no idea who Noel was."
25:08;25:11;"It looks like Liam has a Grateful Dead"
25:11;25:13;"reference on his song ""Greedy Soul."""
25:13;25:14;"What does he say?"
25:14;25:16;"""Greedy Soul, she's got a spinning head,"
25:16;25:18;"like seeing Grateful Dead."""
25:18;25:19;"Okay."
25:19;25:21;"Man, I can't believe there's not"
25:21;25:23;"like some deeper..."
25:23;25:25;"All those guys do is talk."
25:25;25:27;"We gotta get Noel on the show now."
25:27;25:29;"He would love to just spend an hour"
25:29;25:32;"just like talking about bands."
25:32;25:33;"Yeah."
25:33;25:35;"Honestly, that would be a great interview."
25:35;25:37;"We just make a list of like every band"
25:37;25:39;"we can think of to want to get his take on."
25:39;25:40;"Mm-hmm."
25:40;25:42;"It's like guided by voices, go."
25:42;25:44;"I just feel like there'd be so many surprises."
25:44;25:45;"He would just be like..."
25:45;25:46;"Yeah."
25:46;25:48;"""Night, Alien Lanes changed my life."""
25:48;25:50;"I really actually wonder what he thinks of GBV."
25:50;25:53;"I always thought there was a GBV oasis."
25:53;25:56;"A Venn diagram with the Beatles right in the middle."
25:56;25:57;"Oh, yeah."
25:57;26:00;"There's definitely some shared DNA."
26:00;26:03;"Yeah, I feel like he'd be kind of into it."
26:03;26:05;"I could also see him not knowing that band"
26:05;26:08;"because he was a huge rock star"
26:08;26:10;"by the time GBV broke."
26:10;26:12;"I might be off here because now I'm painting"
26:12;26:15;"this picture of him as being like this gruff dude"
26:15;26:18;"who behind closed doors is actually a very sweet guy"
26:18;26:20;"who doesn't take himself seriously."
26:20;26:22;"There's probably somebody listening who is like,"
26:22;26:24;"""You're so deeply wrong."""
26:24;26:27;"But I'm picturing him having deep generosity of spirit."
26:27;26:30;"And I'm also picturing him being like a music nerd."
26:30;26:36;"I'm kind of picturing him on tour, mid-90s,"
26:36;26:40;"hitting the Amoeba in Berkeley,"
26:40;26:43;"just walking out with armfuls of all the latest"
26:43;26:47;"Matador releases, just checking in on everything,"
26:47;26:50;"just going deep and being like, ""All right, all right."
26:50;26:51;"Yeah, yeah."""
26:51;26:54;"That really says that his public persona was a character."
26:54;26:58;"I do think he was legitimately very arrogant."
26:58;27:01;"And arrogance leads to a disinterest in others' music."
27:01;27:03;"Or it would just be like, ""Oh, Matador?"
27:03;27:04;"That's all arty stuff."""
27:04;27:06;"Yeah, like, ""No, what do you think of Pavement?"
27:06;27:07;"No, what do you think of Nirvana?"
27:07;27:09;"Dinosaur Jr."""
27:09;27:10;"It'd be interesting."
27:10;27:14;"Hate Pavement, deeply respect GBV,"
27:14;27:17;"like some early Dinosaur Jr."
27:17;27:20;"I guess he's also a nationalist."
27:20;27:21;"You got to keep that in mind, too."
27:21;27:23;"Loves Stone Temple Pilots."
27:23;27:24;"Maybe."
27:24;27:25;"That's true. He's a nationalist."
27:25;27:26;"He's a nationalist."
27:26;27:28;"The British flags and all that shit."
27:28;27:31;"I could also just picture him just being deeply uninterested"
27:31;27:32;"in American rock."
27:32;27:34;"Maybe because Americans weren't interested enough"
27:34;27:37;"in Stone Roses and in spiral carpets."
27:37;27:40;"So he has to kind of repay the favor."
27:40;27:43;"This is fun, speculating on the Noel Gallagher interview"
27:43;27:44;"on the land."
27:44;27:47;"If we don't get him, we're going to create a Noel Gallagher AI,"
27:47;27:49;"and we're going to do a two-hour special."
27:49;27:51;"We're going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars"
27:51;27:53;"developing a Noel Gallagher AI,"
27:53;27:56;"and then we're going to ask it about all sorts of just, like,"
27:56;27:57;"random shit."
27:57;28:02;"Just like, ""Noel, the Lemonheads, go."""
28:02;28:05;"I got a list here of some Noel Burns on various bands."
28:05;28:06;"Do you want to hear a couple?"
28:06;28:07;"Sure."
28:07;28:09;"We'd love it."
28:09;28:12;"Okay, we got Noel on Radiohead."
28:12;28:15;"I reckon if Tom York [expletive] it into a light bulb"
28:15;28:17;"and started blowing it like an empty beer bottle,"
28:17;28:21;"it'd probably get 9 out of 10 in [expletive] Mojo."
28:21;28:22;"He's not wrong."
28:22;28:26;"And also, that's not even necessarily a Radiohead diss."
28:26;28:28;"That's just, like, cultural commentary."
28:28;28:29;"Yes."
28:29;28:30;"Yeah."
28:30;28:31;"Arctic Monkeys."
28:31;28:33;"Do you want to hear about Jack White?"
28:33;28:34;"What do you have to say about him?"
28:34;28:35;"Yes, please, please."
28:35;28:38;"Jack White, he looks like Zorro on Donuts."
28:38;28:39;"I remember that one."
28:39;28:42;"What's Donuts?"
28:42;28:43;"Is that a drug?"
28:43;28:44;"He was body shaming him."
28:44;28:45;"That's not cool."
28:45;28:46;"Oh, okay."
28:46;28:52;"What's so odious about being fat?"
28:52;28:53;"Okay, Jim Morrison would not approve."
28:53;28:55;"Wait, he said something about Arctic Monkeys?"
28:55;28:58;"I would rather drink petrol straight from the nozzle at a garage"
28:58;29:02;"than listen to an interview with Alex Turner from the Arctic Monkeys."
29:02;29:03;"That's via--"
29:03;29:05;"I guess it's not about the music, is my--"
29:05;29:08;"That one kind of works for my hypothesis."
29:08;29:11;"Because I would imagine if you're Noel Gallagher"
29:11;29:13;"and you see Arctic Monkeys come out"
29:13;29:17;"and you are a hardcore rock nationalist,"
29:17;29:20;"you would have to have some sense of pride"
29:20;29:25;"that there's another big northern UK rock band coming out."
29:25;29:27;"You would have to imagine he likes the music."
29:27;29:30;"But I almost, when I hear that quote, again with zero context,"
29:30;29:34;"I'm picturing him being like, ""Mate, the music's all right,"
29:34;29:38;"but your interview game is lacking."""
29:38;29:41;"Maybe he's almost just disappointed."
29:41;29:48;"Just like, ""Alex, we have a great tradition of UK rock dude interviews."
29:48;29:51;"I need you to think more holistically, man."
29:51;29:53;"I need you to come out and say more spicy sh*t."""
29:53;29:55;"You know what would roll if Noel came out"
29:55;29:59;"and just did a rock-based stand-up special?"
29:59;30:02;"Or one of those Eminem songs where he disses 50 people"
30:02;30:04;"in the span of an entire song?"
30:04;30:07;"Just like, taking it to the..."
30:07;30:08;"Here's what he said."
30:08;30:11;"So this is Noel on the worst band he's ever heard."
30:11;30:14;"""Do you ever look at the sky and think, 'I'm glad I'm alive?'"
30:14;30:16;"After I heard Sum 41, I thought,"
30:16;30:19;"'I'm actually alive to hear the sh*ttiest band of all time.'"""
30:19;30:22;"Which is quite something when you think about it."
30:22;30:24;"(imitates guitar riff)"
30:24;30:25;"Harsh."
30:25;30:26;"(imitates guitar riff)"
30:26;30:28;"But kind of deep, too."
30:28;30:31;"It is just like, honestly, putting it that way"
30:31;30:34;"is like, 10 times more interesting"
30:34;30:38;"than just being like, ""That band sucks. I hate them."""
30:38;30:40;"Well, it's also weird that his brother--"
30:40;30:42;"Wait, was it Blink-182 that his brother said"
30:42;30:44;"was the best he'd seen in America?"
30:44;30:45;"Yes."
30:45;30:48;"So, I mean, to me-- Maybe I'm crazier,"
30:48;30:52;"but Blink-182 and Sum 41, that's a similar universe."
30:52;30:53;"Sure."
30:53;30:55;"But you know what? They're brothers."
30:55;30:57;"Doesn't mean they have the same taste."
30:57;30:59;"No, in fact, they go out of their way not to."
30:59;31:01;"They don't get the pop punk."
31:01;31:02;"What else you got, Seinfeld?"
31:02;31:04;"Well, not so much."
31:04;31:07;"We got Billy Joe Armstrong."
31:07;31:09;"He said-- Oh, this is Liam, though."
31:09;31:11;"This is Liam. Do you want to hear what Liam had to say?"
31:11;31:12;"Okay, sure."
31:12;31:14;"""F*ck right off. I'm not having him."
31:14;31:16;"I just don't like his head."""
31:16;31:19;"What, he likes Blink and he doesn't like Green Day?"
31:19;31:21;"""He doesn't like his head."""
31:21;31:23;"(laughs)"
31:23;31:25;"It's not about the music."
31:25;31:28;"There's something about-- I can't fully explain it,"
31:28;31:31;"but there's-- Maybe because in the UK,"
31:31;31:35;"it's a smaller country, there's this really dedicated rock press"
31:35;31:36;"for a long time."
31:36;31:39;"I do think there's this-- It's almost like a tradition"
31:39;31:43;"of bands, and there's a way that sometimes"
31:43;31:47;"UK rock stars from that era talk about stuff"
31:47;31:49;"in this really straightforward way,"
31:49;31:52;"where it's almost just like-- I don't know how to put it."
31:52;31:54;"It's almost more like sports or something,"
31:54;31:57;"where they're just like, ""All right, you got some moves,"
31:57;31:59;"but you can't hit threes for sh*t."""
31:59;32:02;"They have this funny-- It makes me think of reading"
32:02;32:05;"The Bassist from Blur's book."
32:05;32:08;"That came out right when Vampire Weekend first toured the UK,"
32:08;32:11;"and I think one of us bought it at-- Who knows?"
32:11;32:13;"Literally could have been a rest stop,"
32:13;32:15;"and everybody ended up reading it."
32:15;32:17;"His name is Alex James."
32:17;32:19;"The Bassist from Blur."
32:19;32:21;"Seems like an interesting guy. Good-looking."
32:21;32:23;"And I just remember in the book--"
32:23;32:26;"Because he wasn't the primary songwriter by any stretch."
32:26;32:28;"There's obviously a Damon Albarn,"
32:28;32:31;"and then you have Graham,"
32:31;32:33;"who also wrote some great songs,"
32:33;32:35;"or Coffee and TV, a very strong single."
32:35;32:38;"And his vibe talking about the band,"
32:38;32:41;"he would just always talk about the superficial elements,"
32:41;32:43;"but in this funny way."
32:43;32:45;"And I just remember there's at least a few times"
32:45;32:47;"in the book that he talks about haircuts,"
32:47;32:49;"and he was just talking--"
32:49;32:51;"He's talking about his own haircut,"
32:51;32:53;"and he's talking about--"
32:53;32:55;"This line that always stood out to me,"
32:55;32:58;"he's talking about also-ran-type"
32:58;33:01;"failed musicians from his generation."
33:01;33:04;"He just said, ""Yeah, you know, there's this type of dude."
33:04;33:06;"They're pretty good at music,"
33:06;33:08;"but they could just never get their hair right."""
33:08;33:10;"And it was just this funny thing"
33:10;33:12;"for a '90s guy in a band to say."
33:12;33:15;"Just like, ""Yeah, you gotta feel for these guys."
33:15;33:17;"They just never get their hair right."""
33:17;33:19;"It reminds me of this Liam Gallagher,"
33:19;33:21;"just like, ""F*** off. I don't like your head."""
33:21;33:24;"It's almost like there's some sort of cultural understanding"
33:24;33:26;"in that era of British bands"
33:26;33:29;"that being in a band is kind of bulls***."
33:29;33:31;"Almost there's an acceptance"
33:31;33:34;"that it's some funny mix of modeling"
33:34;33:37;"meets just corporate marketing"
33:37;33:39;"meets a bit of art."
33:39;33:41;"I don't know why. I just can't think of"
33:41;33:43;"quite an American equivalent."
33:43;33:45;"Or in America, maybe we'd associate that type of talk"
33:45;33:47;"more with other genres."
33:47;33:49;"But in the UK, it's understood."
33:49;33:51;"""Yeah, rock and roll, baby. Just another form of pop music."
33:51;33:53;"Get your f***ing haircut right."""
33:53;33:55;"It sounds like they have sort of an '80s"
33:55;33:57;"hair metal band attitude."
33:57;33:59;"But their look is obviously much different."
33:59;34:03;"Whereas in the '90s, in that era in America,"
34:03;34:05;"the bands that were big were like,"
34:05;34:07;"at least in terms of their image,"
34:07;34:09;"were anti-corporate and anti-image."
34:09;34:11;"They couldn't admit it."
34:11;34:13;"Obviously, Kurt was very image-concerned."
34:13;34:15;"I've talked before about you look at his notebooks."
34:15;34:18;"He was a student of rock history."
34:18;34:20;"He knew you had to get the logo right."
34:20;34:22;"You had to get all that s*** on deck."
34:22;34:24;"He cared."
34:24;34:26;"But yet, you could never picture Kurt Cobain"
34:26;34:28;"in an interview where he'd just like..."
34:28;34:30;"You imagine somebody being like,"
34:30;34:32;"""So, Kurt, you guys really exploded out of the scene."
34:32;34:34;"But there's a lot of hard-rocking Seattle-based bands"
34:34;34:36;"with roots in punk rock."
34:36;34:38;"What is it about you guys?"""
34:38;34:40;"And just be like, ""Okay, well, first of all,"
34:40;34:42;"a lot of these dudes just can't get their f***ing hair right."
34:42;34:44;"I'm sorry. Say what you will."
34:44;34:46;"But me, Chris, and Dave,"
34:46;34:48;"our hair f***ing looks correct."""
34:48;34:50;"Even if he felt that..."
34:50;34:52;"I mean, Chris has got that burly goatee."
34:52;34:54;"I mean, come on."
34:54;34:56;"It kind of just worked."
34:56;34:57;"And it just worked."

35:35;35:36;"- Yeah. - He probably doesn't"
35:36;35:39;"like the Chili's, but it's like Pumpkins like."
35:39;35:41;"- He's toured with Smashing Pumpkins."
35:41;35:43;"- Really? - I'm just like, wow."
35:43;35:45;"Okay, wow. - High Flying Birds."
35:45;35:46;"Not long ago, a couple of years ago."
35:46;35:48;"- Oh wait, open for Pumpkins?"
35:48;35:50;"That had to be a little."
35:50;35:52;"- Unless this is Noel's solo."
35:52;35:55;"- No, I know, but still opening for Pumpkins must've."
35:55;35:57;"- But remember this dude used to work"
35:57;35:59;"in Spiral Carpets crew."

36:03;36:06;"at Smashing Pumpkins' Darcy Retsky."

36:09;36:11;"- 2019."
36:11;36:12;"- I didn't think Darcy was on that tour."
36:12;36:14;"I actually saw that tour."
36:14;36:15;"- Wait, what?"
36:15;36:17;"- I missed Noel."
36:17;36:19;"I saw the Pumpkins at the forum."
36:19;36:21;"I went with my brother."
36:21;36:23;"But we came in late, we missed the opening."
36:23;36:24;"- I missed Noel?"
36:24;36:25;"Damn."
36:25;36:27;"- I guess I missed Noel."
36:27;36:29;"Missed the first like 40 minutes of the show."
36:29;36:33;"- He also managed to take a swipe at Billy Corgan."
36:33;36:34;"I guess right while they were on tour,"
36:34;36:37;"he told Rolling Stone we were in the studio together"
36:37;36:38;"one time in LA."
36:38;36:39;"This is back in the day."
36:39;36:41;"I don't remember a great deal about it,"
36:41;36:43;"apart from I think Billy had just bought a new Ferrari"
36:43;36:45;"and he was very proud."
36:45;36:47;"He continues, ""I remember smoking a cigarette,"
36:47;36:48;"""looking at this Ferrari, thinking,"
36:48;36:51;"""I'm not into cars, it's just a (beep) car."""
36:51;36:52;"You know what I mean?"
36:52;36:54;"- Yes, I feel you."
36:54;36:55;"- Oh my God."
36:55;36:58;"Dude, Noel Gallagher and Billy Corgan"
36:58;37:01;"hanging out in the 90s is rough stuff."
37:01;37:03;"- And just Billy being like,"
37:03;37:06;"""Noel, you wanna see my new Ferrari?"""
37:06;37:09;"And him just like walking out and just be like,"
37:09;37:10;"""What do you want me to (beep) say?"
37:10;37:11;"""It's a car, man."""
37:11;37:13;"- Oh my God."
37:13;37:16;"I'm just a working class bloke from Manchester, man."
37:16;37:18;"I don't care about your car, dude."
37:18;37:19;"- And regarding the--"
37:19;37:19;"- I don't give a (beep)"
37:19;37:20;"- Oh my God."
37:20;37:23;"- And regarding the chili peppers,"
37:23;37:27;"Liam rips them for, calls them undignified."
37:27;37:29;"Things are undignified."
37:29;37:30;"- Oh my God."
37:30;37:31;"- Undignified."
37:31;37:34;"- For playing stadium shows, but again--"
37:34;37:34;"- Great word."
37:34;37:35;"- And I love this."
37:35;37:37;"For these reunion tours playing or whatever,"
37:37;37:40;"these playing these giant shows, he calls them undignified."
37:40;37:44;"And his brother's response is he goes on tour with them."
37:44;37:45;"- Wow."
37:45;37:46;"- So Noel then went on tour."
37:46;37:47;"- With the chili peppers?"
37:47;37:48;"- With the chilies?"
37:48;37:49;"- Oh, so he's on tour with everybody."
37:49;37:50;"- So he's on tour with chilies?"
37:50;37:51;"- But--"
37:51;37:52;"- Chili's pumpkins?"
37:52;37:53;"- I think he's just, yeah."
37:53;37:57;"If Liam says he doesn't like somebody or vice versa,"
37:57;37:59;"maybe it actually, I imagine actually it's vice versa."
37:59;38:02;"I imagine Noel said, ""I'll open for you."""
38:02;38:04;"And then Liam was like, ""They're undignified."""
38:04;38:06;"- Well, okay."
38:06;38:07;"- Everything for them does seem to come down"
38:07;38:11;"actually more to his hatred for his brother"
38:11;38:13;"than actually any band."
38:13;38:15;"- I like the idea of Liam doubling down"
38:15;38:17;"on his love of American punk."
38:17;38:20;"So Liam's gonna tour with the Joyce Manor."
38:20;38:24;"And then Noel's gonna keep touring"
38:24;38:25;"with these classic rock acts"
38:25;38:27;"or like classic rock rip off acts."
38:27;38:29;"Dude, Noel's gonna tour with Dead & Co."
38:29;38:30;"- Oh yeah."
38:30;38:31;"- Is this a grift?"
38:31;38:32;"Like one of them says something about--"
38:32;38:34;"- Liam rips Dead & Co a new one."
38:34;38:38;"John Mayer has no tone touch or lyricism."
38:38;38:43;"Noel responds, ""He's actually come a really long way."
38:43;38:46;"He's definitely tapping into some Prime Jerry,"
38:46;38:47;"chromaticism."""
38:47;38:52;"They really do keep things interesting."
38:52;38:55;"- I mean, we just spent an hour talking about Oasis."
38:55;38:56;"- Wasn't planning on it, so."
38:56;38:59;"- Not on the docket at all."
38:59;39:01;"- Not on the docket at all."
39:01;39:02;"I was great."
39:02;39:03;"I might be great again."
39:03;39:04;"Who knows?"

40:05;40:10;"- The last thing I'll say about this is,"
40:10;40:13;"I think I have told the story on the program before,"
40:13;40:17;"but we were, I think, playing right before them"
40:17;40:21;"in 2009 at a festival in Paris,"
40:21;40:23;"and I didn't see this happen."
40:23;40:25;"I remember hearing some commotion"
40:25;40:28;"in the much larger dressing area next to ours,"
40:28;40:30;"and I think some of the other guys in the band"
40:30;40:34;"saw what turned out to be $50,000 guitar"
40:34;40:38;"fly into the air and crash back to the ground."
40:38;40:40;"And this became famously known later"
40:40;40:43;"that this was the fight that ended Oasis,"
40:43;40:48;"that involved Liam destroying Noel's $50,000 guitar,"
40:48;40:49;"and they didn't go on."
40:49;40:54;"So I remember we played, maybe somebody else played,"
40:54;40:58;"then, but everybody's lined up, ready for Oasis to play."
40:58;41:02;"And then I remember just hearing somebody go on"
41:02;41:05;"and tell the audience in French,"
41:05;41:08;"Oasis will not be performing tonight,"
41:08;41:11;"and just hearing 50,000 people, like, whoa."
41:11;41:14;"And then I remember, it was this weird vibe,"
41:14;41:16;"and me and CT walked out,"
41:16;41:18;"and we're kinda just checking out what the vibe was,"
41:18;41:19;"and we were walking along the rail,"
41:19;41:22;"and we chatted with a few people."
41:22;41:25;"And I do remember seeing random people just in tears."
41:25;41:27;"They'd been waiting so long to see Oasis."
41:27;41:30;"They probably didn't even know that the band was breaking up."
41:30;41:32;"I remember at the time being like, really?"
41:32;41:33;"Who cares?"
41:33;41:35;"And then I thought-- - Dude, yeah."
41:35;41:37;"- But then I realized, oh, damn, this is like,"
41:37;41:39;"these are some French Oasis super fans,"
41:39;41:41;"been waiting forever, and now they don't get to see them."
41:41;41:43;"Yeah, that is pretty harsh."
41:43;41:45;"But anyway, outside of all that,"
41:45;41:48;"because Noel, in these long interviews,"
41:48;41:50;"he reveals this side of his personality"
41:50;41:52;"that seems so kinda just like funny,"
41:52;41:55;"aloof, and not self-serious,"
41:55;41:57;"it's always made me wonder"
41:57;42:00;"if the hatred between the brothers"
42:00;42:02;"is some type of like kayfabe,"
42:02;42:04;"you know, wrestling-style rivalry."
42:04;42:07;"And yet, based on everything I've ever heard,"
42:07;42:09;"it's not, at all. (laughs)"
42:09;42:13;"Because obviously, these two dudes,"
42:13;42:16;"they're leaving tens of millions of dollars on the table"
42:16;42:19;"by not having Oasis exist for a decade."
42:19;42:20;"I don't know any details or something,"
42:20;42:22;"and I've met people who know some of them,"
42:22;42:25;"and it's definitely real."
42:25;42:26;"And yet, I still sometimes get this vibe"
42:26;42:27;"where I'm just like,"
42:27;42:30;"even the way they talk (beep) about each other"
42:30;42:32;"in the press seems kinda playful,"
42:32;42:34;"there's something confusing about it to me."
42:34;42:35;"But clearly, it's not a bit."
42:35;42:37;"- I bet it'll happen, though."
42:37;42:40;"Like Coachella in like eight years,"
42:40;42:42;"or two years, or whatever."
42:42;42:44;"Something will bring them back together."
42:44;42:46;"- I don't think so."
42:46;42:47;"- Never?"
42:47;42:50;"- I mean, I think that they really, really hate each other."
42:50;42:52;"I mean, I'm not in a band,"
42:52;42:54;"but I know that, and we've heard,"
42:54;42:58;"there's obviously like deep-seated things of ego, right?"
42:58;43:00;"Of like publishing, of who's writing,"
43:00;43:02;"who's performing, all these things we know,"
43:02;43:04;"and those are very real."
43:04;43:06;"And those seem surmountable."
43:06;43:09;"Like money tends, and the economics,"
43:09;43:11;"surmount that with every one of these reunions."
43:11;43:15;"But you put the brother/family stuff in there,"
43:15;43:19;"and it feels so heightened that it just does,"
43:19;43:22;"it feels like, yeah, it became like a funny thing"
43:22;43:26;"for everyone, but they do genuinely seem to hate each other."
43:26;43:30;"And I do think it's like, it's beyond ego,"
43:30;43:31;"and it's beyond the money,"
43:31;43:33;"and it feels like it's so personal,"
43:33;43:36;"and I think that's what makes it feel so enjoyable also."
43:36;43:38;"But yeah, I don't know."
43:38;43:39;"Are the Black Crows getting together?"
43:39;43:40;"I've heard him talk about it."
43:40;43:42;"- Black Crows were about to do a reunion tour."
43:42;43:43;"- Oh yeah."
43:43;43:47;"- They were starting to advertise it, I think pre-COVID."
43:47;43:48;"So I don't know if it ever happened."
43:48;43:49;"- I remember that."
43:49;43:50;"- And I remember specifically"
43:50;43:54;"that in the promotional materials, they made it clear,"
43:54;43:56;"there will be no jamming."
43:56;43:57;"- Wait, really?"
43:57;43:58;"- Yeah, yeah, I remember in the,"
43:58;44:00;"there was like articles that were just like,"
44:00;44:02;"only the hits, no jamming."
44:02;44:04;"And I wonder if it's because like,"
44:04;44:07;"Chris had been out there, you know, jamming with Phil,"
44:07;44:08;"and doing his Chris Robinson brotherhood,"
44:08;44:11;"and getting like real crunchy and funky,"
44:11;44:14;"and that like the old school Black Crows fans were just like,"
44:14;44:17;"I'm only buying a ticket if both Robinsons are on stage,"
44:17;44:21;"and I can be assured that there will be no jamming."
44:21;44:23;"That'd be funny, like a class action lawsuit"
44:23;44:25;"against the Black Crows,"
44:25;44:29;"because they like vamped a little too long on one song."
44:29;44:30;"And there's like a jamming."
44:30;44:33;"- That version of Remedy was nine minutes and 30 seconds."
44:33;44:35;"- Or it's just like,"
44:35;44:39;"it's like that version of Remedy clocked in at 5.50."
44:39;44:41;"And there's like a judge somewhere who just has to be like,"
44:41;44:44;"I don't think that that counts as jamming."
44:44;44:47;"And just like a lawyer just desperately trying to like prove,"
44:47;44:50;"compared to the studio version, that was a jam."
44:50;44:52;"You have expert witness."
44:52;44:57;"- Matt did just send me that last week,"
44:57;45:00;"Noel tweeted something to the effect of that show"
45:00;45:01;"you were talking about Ezra,"
45:01;45:03;"that he wished that he would have played that."
45:03;45:06;"It would have quote, been a mad gig,"
45:06;45:09;"which has sparked reunion speculation."
45:09;45:12;"The one where he never ended up playing and they broke up."
45:12;45:13;"- Oh, that one."
45:13;45:13;"Would have been a mad gig."
45:13;45:14;"- Which has sparked it."
45:14;45:18;"Now I will say, I still have money on"
45:18;45:21;"that it will never happen because as you know,"
45:21;45:25;"you don't just reunite, you have to practice,"
45:25;45:26;"you have to rehearse."
45:26;45:29;"You have to jam and it won't make it past that."
45:29;45:31;"- Wouldn't it be cool if they did like a tour called like"
45:31;45:34;"the don't look back in anger tour."
45:34;45:36;"And they did like, what was that Metallica documentary"
45:36;45:37;"where they had like a therapist."
45:37;45:40;"- Some kind of, I had the same thoughts, Seinfeld."
45:40;45:41;"- Right, and it's like a real British,"
45:41;45:43;"like a British psychologist is like,"
45:43;45:45;"oh, like put it, like, I'm not gonna do the accent,"
45:45;45:47;"but like, you know, like a nice,"
45:47;45:48;"that would be like an interstitial."
45:48;45:50;"- Right, right."
45:50;45:52;"- Yeah, like do a whole, that'd be huge."
45:52;45:55;"- If you could get the two brothers to sit down"
45:55;45:57;"with like some celebrity psychologist"
45:57;45:59;"for like a five part series."
45:59;46:00;"- Oprah. - With Oprah."
46:00;46:04;"- It would draw more viewers than the Meghan Markle interview"
46:04;46:04;"at least in the UK."
46:04;46:05;"- Oh, absolutely."
46:05;46:08;"- Wait, by the way, I meant to say this earlier,"
46:08;46:11;"speaking of English TV, Nick, who's a TV producer,"
46:11;46:16;"among other things, has a show on the BBC right now."
46:16;46:17;"- Oh yeah."
46:17;46:18;"- Can we talk about this, Nick?"
46:18;46:19;"- It's a wild show."
46:19;46:21;"- It's made a big impression on me."
46:21;46:23;"I think about it all the time."
46:23;46:25;"- So do I, dude."
46:25;46:25;"- Also because-"
46:25;46:27;"- What's up with this show?"
46:27;46:29;"- It's called ""This is My House"""
46:29;46:33;"and the theme song to it is the amazing Flo Rida song,"
46:33;46:36;"♪ Welcome to my house ♪"
46:36;46:38;"And you guys use it over and over again in the show"

46:44;46:45;"Oh yeah."

47:07;47:09;"- I mean, it's an amazing song."
47:09;47:13;"It kind of changed the whole tenor of the idea"
47:13;47:17;"when someone mentioned me, I was talking to him about this,"

49:34;49:36;"So as I understand it,"
49:36;49:40;"the premise is that five contestants enter a house"
49:40;49:41;"and you have 10 minutes to figure out"
49:41;49:43;"if it's Flo Rida's house."
49:43;49:45;"- Yes, no."
49:45;49:46;"- And the whole time you're blasting the song"

49:52;49:53;"- It's like a torture."
49:53;49:56;"- And all the gold records and the platinum records"
49:56;49:58;"are covered up so you can't see."
49:58;50:00;"You're just like, you just like have to look at the,"
50:00;50:01;"open the fridge and you're like,"
50:01;50:06;"""Flo Rida drink vitamin water, uh, uh."""
50:06;50:08;"Anyway, so yeah, explain the actual premise of the show"
50:08;50:09;"'cause it's great."
50:09;50:12;"- The premise of the show is it's a game show."
50:12;50:16;"It's really stupid and it was sort of a joke"
50:16;50:18;"when we started talking about it."
50:18;50:21;"My friend Richard Bacon and I, and he's British,"
50:21;50:25;"and the idea is that four people"
50:25;50:27;"all claim to be the same person"
50:27;50:30;"and claim that it's their house."
50:30;50:32;"So there's, let's say it's you."
50:32;50:35;"There's four people saying they're Ezra Koenig"
50:35;50:36;"and we shoot them in their house"
50:36;50:39;"and they all live in, for 24 hours,"
50:39;50:41;"live in a house and walk around the house"
50:41;50:43;"talking about their house."
50:43;50:47;"But only one of them is really the owner of the house"
50:47;50:49;"and the other three are actors"
50:49;50:51;"all pretending to be that person"
50:51;50:53;"and making up their own stories about stuff."
50:53;50:55;"- And somebody's guiding them through the house"
50:55;50:57;"and meanwhile a panel of celebrities"
50:57;50:59;"are watching this go down."
50:59;51:01;"And just to give people an example"
51:01;51:03;"of like how does this look in practice."
51:03;51:04;"So you have four different people saying,"
51:04;51:06;"""Yeah, welcome to my house, this is my house."""
51:06;51:10;"And then the host might walk over to a piece of furniture,"
51:10;51:13;"like a couch and say, ""Any funny stories about this couch?"""
51:13;51:16;"And then one person say, ""Yeah, as a matter of fact,"
51:16;51:18;"""my husband didn't want me to buy it, whatever."""
51:18;51:20;"And then somebody else is looking at them being like,"
51:20;51:22;"""Oh my, ugh, you're just making this up."
51:22;51:23;"""Here's the story with this couch."
51:23;51:25;"""We actually inherited it from my mother-in-law."""
51:25;51:27;"And somebody's like, ""Ugh, oh my God,"
51:27;51:29;"""it's so weird hearing you lie about my couch."
51:29;51:31;"""Here's the story with the couch."
51:31;51:34;"""Actually, I've had it for years before we got together."""
51:34;51:36;"It's like a series of things like that"
51:36;51:39;"and the people get very competitive with each other,"
51:39;51:40;"kind of just looking at each other being like,"
51:40;51:42;"""Ugh, why are you saying that about my husband?"
51:42;51:44;"""It's so weird."""
51:44;51:46;"And some people are better actors than others"
51:46;51:48;"and one person obviously is the real person,"
51:48;51:52;"but they're all kind of one-upping each other to be like,"
51:52;51:54;"""That's the stupidest thing I ever heard."
51:54;51:57;"""This is my house and the reason that we have that painting"
51:57;51:59;"""is, you know, that kind of (beep)."""
51:59;52:01;"- The truth is that when you start getting very specific"
52:01;52:06;"about your stuff and sometimes the crazier the story sounds"
52:06;52:08;"and the more passionate you are about it,"
52:08;52:10;"the more it seems like you're lying."
52:10;52:11;"- Right. - And so, yeah,"
52:11;52:15;"they sort of argue over things like their couch"
52:15;52:17;"or the clothes in their closet."
52:17;52:21;"They usually bring out their girlfriend or boyfriend"
52:21;52:25;"or their spouse or partner and that person sits there"
52:25;52:29;"while they all recount their wedding story to him or her."
52:29;52:30;"- Right. - And it's,"
52:30;52:31;"I mean, it's psychotic."
52:31;52:33;"I mean, the show is really, like when you talk about,"
52:33;52:35;"yeah, you'll get five minutes of hearing people"
52:35;52:38;"talk about their couch, it's really stupid"
52:38;52:40;"and they get in real fights."
52:40;52:42;"- Yeah. - And then a group"
52:42;52:47;"of celebrities watch it and they have to try to deduce"
52:47;52:50;"who the owner of the house is. - Whose house is."
52:50;52:53;"- And like I said, it was sort of a joke"
52:53;52:57;"and then it became real and then someone suggested"
52:57;53:01;"this Flo Rida song and so then we've got the Flo Rida song"
53:01;53:03;"so we're like, ""We gotta use this at every moment."""
53:03;53:06;"So it is like also in the sort of, yeah,"
53:06;53:08;"kind of like insane nature of the show,"
53:08;53:10;"Flo Rida's voice just keeps popping in and going,"
53:10;53:11;"""That's my house."""
53:11;53:14;"I mean, it's really, it's insane."
53:14;53:17;"- Like back from commercial, ""Welcome to my house."""
53:17;53:19;"- Yeah, and then there's an elimination"
53:19;53:20;"so then about two thirds of the way in,"
53:20;53:24;"the real owner of the house tells the producer"
53:24;53:27;"who they think might be their biggest competition"
53:27;53:31;"and that person's removed so you have three left"
53:31;53:34;"and then those three go to meet the celebrities"
53:34;53:37;"where the celebrities get to ask them questions"
53:37;53:39;"and they have to pick if it's the owner of the house."
53:39;53:43;"And so like the dumb premise is there's never been"
53:43;53:47;"an easier game show to win, you just have to tell the truth."
53:47;53:49;"But nothing feels believable."
53:49;53:51;"There's an end of times element to it."
53:51;53:52;"I mean, I'm interested in what you guys"
53:52;53:55;"would have to say about it and to the, you know,"
53:55;53:58;"Matt Seinfeld, I'll send you some copies"
53:58;54:03;"'cause unless you have a VPN, it's on Wednesday nights"
54:03;54:05;"like at nine and yeah, on BBC One."
54:05;54:08;"- Are the people improvising their lies about the house"
54:08;54:09;"or do they have prep time?"
54:09;54:11;"Do they come up with their stories in advance?"
54:11;54:14;"- They have like 24 hours before where they've been,"
54:14;54:16;"they've walked through the house 'cause yeah,"
54:16;54:18;"if you were to like open a drawer"
54:18;54:20;"and like not know where like the cutlery is or something,"
54:20;54:21;"like then it would be too obvious."
54:21;54:24;"So people get to like, it's basically three people"
54:24;54:28;"sabotaging someone in their truth, you know?"
54:28;54:30;"- And they get a heads up about to start making up"
54:30;54:31;"little stories in their head"
54:31;54:34;"so that they're not totally on the spot."
54:34;54:36;"- Right, and you know, and as you guys know,"
54:36;54:39;"I just need to say it for anyone, you know, listening."
54:39;54:40;"Like this is also not,"
54:40;54:43;"what I don't normally make shows on like this."
54:43;54:44;"I'd like to make more,"
54:44;54:47;"but it is about the silliest and stupidest thing"
54:47;54:47;"that I've ever made."
54:47;54:51;"- It has like the tone, it's very unique,"
54:51;54:56;"but it's familiar in terms of like British reality show,"
54:56;54:57;"game show vibes."
54:57;54:58;"- Yeah."
54:58;55:00;"- Like if you're looking for some of Nick's"
55:00;55:03;"adult swim background, well, you could probably,"
55:03;55:06;"in a really deep way, you could probably make a connection."
55:06;55:11;"And also to be 9 p.m. on Wednesday on BBC One"
55:11;55:15;"or Channel One or whatever, the BBC, whatever in the UK,"
55:15;55:18;"that's like the equivalent of like some must see TV,"
55:18;55:19;"right, in the US."
55:19;55:20;"- Yeah."
55:20;55:22;"- That's like an American Idol type slot, right?"
55:22;55:24;"- Yeah, they moved it up."
55:24;55:27;"It was actually commissioned for BBC Two,"
55:27;55:29;"which I think of the lower, not lower,"
55:29;55:30;"but the more you go down,"
55:30;55:31;"I don't know the British system that well,"
55:31;55:34;"but they sort of, that's the cooler sort of smaller one."
55:34;55:37;"I think BBC Two may be where the office started"
55:37;55:39;"and then sort of graduates."
55:39;55:40;"- Right."
55:40;55:42;"- They saw this and they moved it to BBC One."
55:42;55:44;"- Is this like a big hit in the UK?"
55:44;55:46;"- It appears to me that it is."
55:46;55:47;"You know, I'm not there and I can't watch it,"
55:47;55:50;"but everyone seems very, very happy about it."
55:50;55:53;"And it's always like one of the number one trending topic."
55:53;55:55;"Like it's also like young."
55:55;55:57;"I mean, it feels weird."
55:57;56:00;"I think there is a sort of, it's right now,"
56:00;56:05;"like people want something that may not test them"
56:05;56:07;"and just is sort of enjoyable,"
56:07;56:11;"but also has some sort of very smart undercurrent."
56:11;56:15;"Like I do think that it's just bizarre enough."
56:15;56:16;"And I think, and it is smart enough"
56:16;56:20;"that you could like write why it's not stupid."
56:20;56:22;"- Do you think you've tapped into the zeitgeist in some way?"
56:22;56:26;"Like we've spent a year all homebound, you know,"
56:26;56:29;"getting acquainted with our houses,"
56:29;56:30;"the various ins and outs,"
56:30;56:32;"getting, developing a stronger relationship."
56:32;56:34;"Now here comes, this is my house."
56:34;56:35;"And it sort of becomes a fulfillment of-"
56:35;56:38;"- I mean, yeah, I definitely think"
56:38;56:40;"that this idea was before then,"
56:40;56:43;"but that it has benefited from quarantine"
56:43;56:44;"for a lot of reasons."
56:44;56:46;"And one of them definitely is that."
56:46;56:48;"I think that people are at home."
56:48;56:51;"They're used to being really at home,"
56:51;56:53;"but they're also not out at their friends' houses"
56:53;56:55;"or their family's houses as much."
56:55;56:56;"And like, they're looking at this"
56:56;56:59;"and they're able to like actually sort of"
56:59;57:01;"have that sort of enjoyment, I think."
57:01;57:05;"And I don't know, I saw some review today"
57:05;57:09;"that was like, they got quarantine TV right."
57:09;57:11;"'Cause I do think that so many people"
57:11;57:13;"tried to make things like quote, in quarantine."
57:13;57:14;"And they were just like,"
57:14;57:16;"""We're gonna do whole shows with people on Zooms"
57:16;57:17;"""and FaceTime."""
57:17;57:18;"And you're like, you can actually do something"
57:18;57:20;"that's not like that,"
57:20;57:24;"that captures a lot of the feelings that we may be having"
57:24;57:28;"and some of the ambitions that we may have,"
57:28;57:30;"but is not just being like,"
57:30;57:32;"""Oh yeah, we're doing a whole show with people on Zoom."""
57:32;57:35;"- Yeah, 'cause you spend your day on Zoom calls."
57:35;57:39;"You don't wanna like chill out on another Zoom call."
57:39;57:42;"- It sends a positive message to people."
57:42;57:44;"Actually, it makes you also wonder why"
57:44;57:47;"My House by Flo Rida wasn't a quarantine anthem"
57:47;57:48;"from the start."
57:48;57:51;"A kind of celebration of just, you know,"
57:51;57:56;"whether you rent, buy, have a room in somebody else's house,"
57:56;57:58;"living in somebody's basement,"
57:58;58:01;"that's still your space, it's still your house."
58:01;58:02;"You can't really appreciate your house"
58:02;58:04;"until you have three imposters walking around"
58:04;58:06;"saying it's theirs."
58:06;58:07;"And then suddenly, you know,"
58:07;58:09;"you start getting a little territorial."
58:09;58:10;"You know what, I didn't like this place that much,"
58:10;58:12;"but you know what, this is my house."
58:12;58:14;"Welcome to my house. - It's my house."
58:14;58:16;"You know, it's funny you said this thing."
58:16;58:18;"I've listened to this Flo Rida song"
58:18;58:21;"a thousand times at this point."
58:21;58:24;"And maybe it's 'cause I'm listening to it"
58:24;58:27;"through the lens of the show."
58:27;58:28;"But it's funny when you're like,"
58:28;58:29;"oh, it's about having a girl over."
58:29;58:31;"And obviously now I'm really listening to the lyrics,"
58:31;58:32;"I'm like, yeah."
58:32;58:33;"But I definitely was,"
58:33;58:36;"even if you have someone over to your house"
58:36;58:39;"for, you know, late night relations,"
58:39;58:42;"the idea that it's about the pride of your house,"
58:42;58:43;"I always sort of was like,"
58:43;58:44;"oh, it's about a guy having a party."
58:44;58:45;"Or you can almost say like,"
58:45;58:48;"this is a song written about when he bought his new house,"
58:48;58:49;"he's having a housewarming party."
58:49;58:50;"Like there's a weird thing,"
58:50;58:51;"it's like if you have someone over to your house"
58:51;58:53;"and you're like, hey, welcome to my house."
58:53;58:55;"This is, you know, there's one song"
58:55;58:56;"and you might wanna throw this on."
58:56;59:00;"'Cause I found the pride of the house like so,"
59:00;59:02;"you're right, it's so lovely."
59:02;59:03;"And you're like, yeah, I should,"
59:03;59:04;"no matter where I live, it's my house."
59:04;59:06;"It's my stuff, I should take pride in it."
59:06;59:07;"There was a moment where we didn't think"
59:07;59:10;"we could get the song and we got pretty nervous"
59:10;59:13;"because I was like, I had put so much stake on this song,"
59:13;59:15;"like the comedy of the show."
59:15;59:16;"We found one other song,"
59:16;59:18;"which is Diana Ross's song, ""My House."""
59:18;59:20;"When I was looking for songs about my house,"
59:20;59:20;"I don't know if you know,"
59:20;59:22;"but this is another one, which is,"
59:22;59:24;"it doesn't have the energy to be the theme,"
59:24;59:29;"but tonally and the lyrics made me laugh so hard."
59:29;59:29;"If you wanna put it on."
59:29;59:31;"- I'm not familiar with this Diana Ross song."
59:31;59:33;"- I wasn't familiar with it either,"
59:33;59:35;"but it's got a really cool, it's a very cool vibe."
59:38;59:45;"- Very vibey."
59:45;59:50;"♪ It's my house and I live here ♪"
59:50;59:55;"♪ It's my house and I live here ♪"
59:55;01:00:00;"♪ There's a welcome mat at the door ♪"
01:00:00;01:00:04;"♪ And if you come on in, you're gonna get much more ♪"
01:00:04;01:00:09;"♪ There's my chair, I put it there ♪"
01:00:09;01:00:14;"♪ Everything you see is with love and care ♪"
01:00:14;01:00:18;"♪ It's my house and I live here ♪"
01:00:18;01:00:23;"♪ I wanna tell ya, it's my house and I live here ♪"
01:00:23;01:00:26;"- I love this idea of having pride."
01:00:26;01:00:26;"It would've been great."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"And I think we'll probably use it"
01:00:28;01:00:31;"maybe as like a closing theme if we haven't already."
01:00:31;01:00:34;"But like, they were just saying that the energy"
01:00:34;01:00:35;"of the Flo Rida song,"
01:00:35;01:00:39;"but I love this feeling of having pride in your stuff."
01:00:39;01:00:41;"That's my chair and I put it there."
01:00:43;01:00:48;"- Did you ever consider ""Our House"" by Madness?"
01:00:48;01:00:51;"- Yeah, I feel like that's sort of been used a lot."
01:00:51;01:00:55;"But I, you know, I have a whole playlist of just songs"
01:00:55;01:00:57;"about people's homes. - And also that's our house."
01:00:57;01:01:00;"- Yeah, and it's our house and this is my house."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"You know."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"But there is--"
01:01:02;01:01:03;"- I love ""Our House."""
01:01:03;01:01:05;"- Oh yeah, Matt just said burning down the house."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"That's when they cancel us."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"- Well, and maybe this is a good transition."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"We don't have to go too deep."
01:01:10;01:01:11;"We've really been flying by the seat of our pants"
01:01:11;01:01:12;"on this episode."
01:01:13;01:01:14;"I didn't think we were gonna be doing"
01:01:14;01:01:15;"an Oasis Flo Rida episode."
01:01:15;01:01:16;"Although in the back of my head,"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"I did wanna talk about the show."
01:01:18;01:01:21;"But listening to those lyrics made me think"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"about talking heads."
01:01:23;01:01:26;"Because there's actually something very like,"
01:01:26;01:01:27;"I was thinking about David Byrne's lyrics today"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"because we found a picture,"
01:01:29;01:01:33;"it was posted by the Grateful Dead fan,"
01:01:33;01:01:38;"Jamban, the Instagram account, lot.com."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"And they found a picture I'd never seen before"
01:01:40;01:01:44;"of David Byrne and Bob Weir wearing headphones,"
01:01:44;01:01:47;"sitting next to each other in 1986."
01:01:47;01:01:51;"And actually I had a funny comment from Jack Wagner"
01:01:51;01:01:53;"of Yeah But Still Pod,"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"who said like, ""This is the first podcast."""
01:01:55;01:01:56;"And if you look at it,"
01:01:56;01:01:57;"it totally looks like they're doing,"
01:01:57;01:02:00;"you see like two dudes with headphones next to each other,"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"just like podcast vibe."
01:02:02;01:02:03;"But this is 1986,"
01:02:03;01:02:04;"so they were probably just doing a radio interview."
01:02:04;01:02:08;"But basically it turned out David Byrne"
01:02:08;01:02:11;"watched a Grateful Dead show in Berkeley"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"at the Greek Theater in 1986."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"And he was there,"
01:02:14;01:02:17;"it's unclear exactly what he was doing there,"
01:02:17;01:02:21;"but clearly he had some sort of chat with Bob Weir."
01:02:21;01:02:25;"And there's like a journalist there who asked about"
01:02:25;01:02:29;"if the talking heads could be the Grateful Dead of the 80s,"
01:02:29;01:02:32;"which maybe was something people were saying in 1986."
01:02:32;01:02:35;"Talking heads, you know, kind of legendary live band."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"Maybe there was some feeling,"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"could the talking heads, such a different band,"
01:02:39;01:02:42;"but could they maybe be handed the torch?"
01:02:42;01:02:44;"And this journalist, David Ganz asked Bob Weir,"
01:02:44;01:02:45;"""What do you think about that?"
01:02:45;01:02:48;"Could talking heads be the Grateful Dead of the 80s?"""
01:02:48;01:02:51;"And Weir's response was, ""God help them."""
01:02:51;01:02:53;"But anyway, the reason I started thinking"
01:02:53;01:02:53;"of talking heads just now"
01:02:53;01:02:57;"is I started going through the talking heads discography"
01:02:57;01:03:01;"and I asked the rest of the TC crew to do the same"
01:03:01;01:03:02;"to see what connections we could find."
01:03:02;01:03:06;"Like what's the most deadish head song?"
01:03:06;01:03:09;"What's the most heads-ish dead song?"
01:03:09;01:03:12;"Dead heads, that'd be the name for the cover band"
01:03:12;01:03:14;"that only does Grateful Dead and talking head song."
01:03:14;01:03:18;"But listening to David Byrne's lyrics,"
01:03:18;01:03:20;"he did invent the style, which is like the,"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"I don't know how to describe it."
01:03:22;01:03:25;"I associate it a lot with like cool, weird,"
01:03:25;01:03:28;"downtown New York, early punk rock, new wave,"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"but that vibe of just kind of being like,"
01:03:30;01:03:33;"let me just describe some regular (beep)"
01:03:33;01:03:35;"this kind of like eerie 70s vibe"
01:03:35;01:03:38;"of just kind of like describing modern life"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"with very little commentary,"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"which in and of itself has its own commentary."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"- More songs about buildings and food."
01:03:44;01:03:45;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:03:45;01:03:46;"More songs about buildings and food."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"And you could totally picture like"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"on one of the first three talking heads records,"
01:03:50;01:03:55;"like a song that's like, ""It's my house and I live here."
01:03:55;01:03:57;"That chair, I put it there."""
01:03:57;01:03:58;"You know what I mean?"
01:03:58;01:04:01;"It really has like a college art rock vibe."
01:04:01;01:04:04;"That chair, I put it there."
01:04:04;01:04:05;"You know what I mean?"
01:04:05;01:04:06;"And obviously talking heads do have,"
01:04:06;01:04:08;"""This is not my beautiful house."""
01:04:08;01:04:11;"That could have been another option for the show."
01:04:11;01:04:13;"But there's something about that type of lyric,"
01:04:13;01:04:15;"just like if not talking heads,"
01:04:15;01:04:18;"maybe somebody else from that era,"
01:04:18;01:04:20;"like Richard Hell or television or something,"
01:04:20;01:04:22;"just like, ""It's my house and I live here."""
01:04:22;01:04:24;"I even just like picture like picking up some like"
01:04:24;01:04:26;"punk single that had like the lyrics on it"
01:04:26;01:04:27;"and you don't even know what the band is."
01:04:27;01:04:29;"And you're like, ""What is this, 1978?"""
01:04:29;01:04:31;"And you just like read the lyrics on the back."
01:04:31;01:04:33;"""It's my house and I live here."
01:04:33;01:04:35;"That chair, I put it there."
01:04:35;01:04:36;"It's my house and I live here."""
01:04:36;01:04:37;"You know what I mean?"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"It just sounds like weird punk rock."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"It could also be like some LA hardcore,"
01:04:41;01:04:44;"like some weird Black Flag song."
01:04:44;01:04:45;"""It's my house and I live here."
01:04:45;01:04:46;"It's my house and I live here."
01:04:46;01:04:47;"That chair, I put it there."
01:04:47;01:04:49;"That chair, I put it there."""
01:04:49;01:04:51;"So maybe Diana, that sounds like some late '70s."
01:04:51;01:04:52;"Maybe Diana was feeling that kind of,"
01:04:52;01:04:53;"there's something in the air."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"She's feeling that punk rock spirit."
01:04:55;01:04:59;"But anyway, that was my awkward transition"
01:04:59;01:05:01;"from Diana Ross to talking heads."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"- Not awkward."
01:05:02;01:05:03;"- Thank you, I appreciate that, Jake."
01:05:03;01:05:04;"- Masterful."
01:05:04;01:05:05;"- Thank you."
01:05:05;01:05:07;"Thinking about this moment when, you know,"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"David Byrne's watching ""Bob Weir"""
01:05:09;01:05:12;"and we were already texting about it on the TC Text thread."
01:05:12;01:05:17;"Just like pulling up the set list at the Greek Theater."
01:05:17;01:05:20;"Jack Straw opener, box of rain closer."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"I think I told you guys that I was playing it"
01:05:22;01:05:23;"in my household."
01:05:23;01:05:26;"And there's a little bit of like,"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"""What are you listening to?"""
01:05:27;01:05:30;"It's not the strongest box of rain performance."
01:05:30;01:05:31;"- A little bit of domestic tension."
01:05:31;01:05:33;"- A little bit of domestic tension,"
01:05:33;01:05:33;"busting out that-"
01:05:33;01:05:34;"- Music choice."
01:05:34;01:05:37;"- That 622-86 box of rain."
01:05:37;01:05:40;"I had to explain, ""Babe, this is a great song."""
01:05:40;01:05:41;"- I'm working."
01:05:41;01:05:42;"- Hey, I'm working."
01:05:42;01:05:45;"- I'm prepping for the show."
01:05:45;01:05:46;"- This is a great song."
01:05:46;01:05:47;"It's one of Jake's all-time faves."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"Is that fair to say, Jake,"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"box of rain's one of your favorite dead songs?"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"- Yeah, I'd put that top 10."
01:05:52;01:05:53;"- It's just not, you know,"
01:05:53;01:05:55;"it's not like a classic live song."
01:05:55;01:05:58;"- I would never like seek out a live version of box of rain."
01:05:58;01:06:00;"But still, a great song nonetheless."
01:06:00;01:06:01;"That's when you-"
01:06:01;01:06:02;"- Beautiful song."
01:06:02;01:06:04;"- You want to start with the studio recording, for sure."
01:06:04;01:06:05;"- Yeah."
01:06:05;01:06:06;"- But anyway, we're just kind of picturing David Byrne,"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"like taking in the show."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"Our big question, you know, looking at like,"
01:06:10;01:06:11;"this is what's in like set one."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"Jack Straw, Must Have Been the Roses."
01:06:13;01:06:16;"Beautiful song, especially when Jake sings it."
01:06:16;01:06:19;"Cassidy, Roe, Jimmy Roe, New Minglewood Blues,"
01:06:19;01:06:20;"Big Railroad Blues."
01:06:20;01:06:21;"- Good set list."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"- Mama Tried, Big River, Stagger Lee,"
01:06:23;01:06:26;"Hell in a Bucket, Might As Well, Samson and Delilah,"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"Ship of Fools, Man, Smart Woman,"
01:06:28;01:06:33;"- That's a very strong set with a few exceptions."
01:06:33;01:06:36;"- Drum space, Out of Space, Truckin',"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"Going Down the Road, Feeling Bad, Stella Blue,"
01:06:38;01:06:39;"Turn on Your Love Light."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"I mean, you probably know that's a cover."
01:06:41;01:06:43;"US Blues, Box of Rain."
01:06:43;01:06:43;"We're just kind of wondering like,"
01:06:43;01:06:46;"how tapped in would David Byrne have been?"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"'Cause you could totally picture him just being like,"
01:06:49;01:06:50;"knowing about the Grateful Dead,"
01:06:50;01:06:54;"maybe being kind of fascinated by like the cultural element,"
01:06:54;01:06:57;"but like maybe not knowing 99% of these songs."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"- So he was born in '52."
01:07:00;01:07:03;"In '72, he's 20."
01:07:03;01:07:05;"Hard to know what his scene,"
01:07:05;01:07:09;"so he's 25 or 24 when he started talking heads,"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"or probably earlier, but like,"
01:07:11;01:07:11;"yeah, hard to know."
01:07:11;01:07:14;"Like we were texting, like maybe he had an older brother"
01:07:14;01:07:18;"that was kind of a hippie that was like in on the dead."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"'Cause like you gotta figure early '70s,"
01:07:20;01:07:24;"David Byrne's into like, go full circle here, Lou Reed."
01:07:24;01:07:25;"- You would think."
01:07:25;01:07:26;"- Can I just call out the TomTom Club"
01:07:26;01:07:29;"opened for Grateful Dead in 1988,"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"for whatever that's worth?"
01:07:31;01:07:32;"- Well, yeah, and then it's--"
01:07:32;01:07:33;"- Tight."
01:07:33;01:07:35;"- No, that's a good call, 'cause it seems like"
01:07:35;01:07:37;"Chris Franz, the drummer of Talking Heads,"
01:07:37;01:07:40;"who started TomTom Club with Tina Weymouth, his wife,"
01:07:40;01:07:43;"they had a whole connection where they opened for the dead,"
01:07:43;01:07:46;"and then they would hang out a lot with Bob."
01:07:46;01:07:49;"They hung out when they played the garden,"
01:07:49;01:07:52;"and seemed like they were like checking in on each other."
01:07:52;01:07:55;"He said Bob would came down to see TomTom Club"
01:07:55;01:07:57;"when they did a five night run at CBGB's."
01:07:57;01:08:01;"So maybe there is some kind of like deep interplay happening"
01:08:01;01:08:02;"between the two bands,"
01:08:02;01:08:05;"but that doesn't necessarily mean that Byrne"
01:08:05;01:08:06;"was that tapped in."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"And yeah, you could also picture Byrne"
01:08:08;01:08:11;"having very little context for them,"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"and this is just like the first time he's taking it all in,"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"it's like 1986 in Berkeley."
01:08:15;01:08:16;"But he sat down and did an interview with Bob,"
01:08:16;01:08:19;"where we gotta see if we can find the audio of that"
01:08:19;01:08:22;"somewhere, but it made me think a bunch about like,"
01:08:22;01:08:23;"the connections between the bands."
01:08:23;01:08:26;"'Cause obviously, maybe the loosest connection"
01:08:26;01:08:30;"is that they're both kind of like two legendary live bands,"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"and in very different ways, you know,"
01:08:31;01:08:36;"Grateful Dead, Improvisatory, Jerry Garcia's solos,"
01:08:36;01:08:40;"Talking Heads, just like the kind of like perfection"
01:08:40;01:08:43;"of Remain in Light, which by the way,"
01:08:43;01:08:46;"I'm not trying to be a hater, but it has a lot of overdubs."
01:08:46;01:08:48;"You know, they wanted it to be perfect."
01:08:48;01:08:50;"When you watch the movie-- - Like Europe 72."
01:08:50;01:08:53;"- Well yeah, and like Europe 72, that's true."
01:08:53;01:08:55;"So the talking, the Grateful Dead could relate."
01:08:55;01:08:59;"In their early days, they strive for a type of perfection."
01:08:59;01:09:00;"I think they probably loosened up a bit."
01:09:00;01:09:03;"- And I think the early Dick Picks releases in the 90s,"
01:09:03;01:09:07;"the Dead were very like uptight and controlling"
01:09:07;01:09:12;"about like which songs made it on those releases."
01:09:12;01:09:13;"And they loosened up over time,"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"but like the early Dick Picks collections"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"were not just like straight up shows."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"- Right."
01:09:18;01:09:20;"- They were sort of like greatest hits compilations"
01:09:20;01:09:24;"from like, you know, two shows, three shows."
01:09:24;01:09:25;"- That's actually interesting."
01:09:25;01:09:27;"I guess I vaguely knew that, but it's funny"
01:09:27;01:09:32;"because you picture the culture of Deadheads trading tapes"
01:09:32;01:09:36;"and having access in their network of tape traders"
01:09:36;01:09:38;"to just about every show."
01:09:38;01:09:40;"So you feel like, of course, that's part of the culture,"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"but that doesn't mean that the band was in on it."
01:09:42;01:09:44;"And you could imagine somebody's like,"
01:09:44;01:09:47;"""Guys, you should start doing more official live releases."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"""You have so much great stuff in the archives"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"""and people trade this (beep) all the time."""
01:09:51;01:09:53;"And, you know, maybe them listening back to a show"
01:09:53;01:09:56;"and just being like, ""Oh God, you're telling me"
01:09:56;01:10:00;"""that there's like a dorm room full of like stoners"
01:10:00;01:10:03;"""at like Andover jamming this?"
01:10:03;01:10:05;"""Jesus Christ, can somebody sneak in there"
01:10:05;01:10:07;"""and like delete all the tapes?"""
01:10:07;01:10:08;"Like, no."
01:10:08;01:10:11;"They didn't realize how deeply people were like interacting"
01:10:11;01:10:14;"with the recorded live material"
01:10:14;01:10:15;"or they didn't wanna think about it."
01:10:15;01:10:16;"And then suddenly they're like,"
01:10:16;01:10:17;"""All right, let's make this official."""
01:10:17;01:10:21;"And it's like, ""Oof, that was an off night or something."""
01:10:21;01:10:22;"- For sure."
01:10:22;01:10:26;"- Okay, so I was thinking a little bit about"
01:10:26;01:10:29;"what Grateful Dead and Talking Head songs"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"have the most in common."
01:10:31;01:10:32;"And it was a little random."
01:10:32;01:10:35;"Jake, did you come up with your own pairings?"
01:10:35;01:10:36;"Did you have any thoughts on it?"
01:10:36;01:10:37;"Okay, so maybe I'll start."
01:10:37;01:10:39;"This is like a weird one that came to mind."
01:10:39;01:10:41;"And this is also why I was thinking about"
01:10:41;01:10:43;"that Diana Ross song and that specific"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"kind of slice of David Byrne type lyrics"
01:10:45;01:10:48;"that's just like describing modern life"
01:10:48;01:10:51;"with like very little commentary."
01:10:51;01:10:56;"And this song has a weird touch of like Grateful Dead to me."
01:10:56;01:11:00;"And it's the last song on More Buildings and Food"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"and it's called ""The Big Country."""
01:11:02;01:11:04;"Are you familiar with this one?"
01:11:04;01:11:05;"- Maybe if I hear it."
01:11:05;01:11:07;"I'm not like a huge Talking Heads head, so."
01:11:07;01:11:09;"- You know, I was kind of wondering."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"I guess I just assumed you were"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"just 'cause they're like classic alternative band."
01:11:12;01:11:15;"But yeah, you don't talk about them a lot."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"- I have like a very like academic appreciation."
01:11:17;01:11:20;"I don't like connect on a deep, well,"
01:11:20;01:11:24;"kind of emotional level, but some of their songs I do."
01:11:24;01:11:26;"Heaven, you know, ""This Must Be the Place."""
01:11:26;01:11:28;"Yeah, obviously. - Oh yeah, beautiful song."
01:11:30;01:11:32;"Slide guitar."
01:11:32;01:11:33;"- Yeah."
01:11:33;01:11:35;"Oh yeah, this one."
01:11:37;01:11:39;"So what year is this?"
01:11:39;01:11:40;"- '78."
01:11:45;01:12:02;"- Real steady beat."
01:12:04;01:12:08;"♪ I see the shapes ♪"
01:12:08;01:12:13;"♪ I remember thumb maps ♪"

01:12:55;01:12:58;"And in a very vague sense,"
01:12:58;01:13:01;"this is kind of like psychedelic Americana."
01:13:01;01:13:03;"Like he's coming at it from his own angle,"
01:13:03;01:13:07;"but the idea of just kind of like being in a plane"
01:13:07;01:13:09;"and looking at America."
01:13:09;01:13:11;"- Well, do you know that late Grateful..."
01:13:11;01:13:12;"- Yeah, which one?"
01:13:12;01:13:13;"- I was gonna say,"
01:13:13;01:13:16;"there's that late Grateful Dead song, ""Standing on the Moon."""
01:13:16;01:13:18;"- Is that like on the last album?"
01:13:18;01:13:21;"- Yeah, it's on ""Built to Last."""
01:13:21;01:13:23;"Anyway, the perspective is like"
01:13:23;01:13:26;"Jerry and Robert Hunter are standing on the moon"
01:13:26;01:13:30;"and they're looking at the earth as it's rotating."
01:13:30;01:13:31;"And they're singing about"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"all the different continents and stuff."
01:13:33;01:13:34;"- Well, okay, deep."
01:13:37;01:13:41;"Anybody could write a song about being in a plane"
01:13:41;01:13:42;"and looking at any type of landscape,"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"but I do like that David Byrne,"
01:13:44;01:13:48;"he's saying all stuff that's very international"
01:13:48;01:13:49;"that you could find anywhere,"
01:13:49;01:13:52;"places to park, schools, whatever."
01:13:52;01:13:55;"But he also says,"
01:13:55;01:13:58;"I like when he goes, ""Baseball diamonds."""
01:13:58;01:14:00;"Just the idea of like this like tripped out,"
01:14:00;01:14:01;"like looking down in a plane,"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"just like looking at how all the parts"
01:14:03;01:14:04;"of the world work together."
01:14:04;01:14:06;"It is kind of psychedelic, just like,"
01:14:06;01:14:10;"look at that man, schools, baseball diamonds,"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"it's all part of a bigger thing."
01:14:12;01:14:15;"But the vibe of it with the slide guitar made me think,"
01:14:15;01:14:16;"and I was trying to think like,"
01:14:16;01:14:17;"what song do I connect it to?"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"And that's a great point,"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"lyrically, ""Standing on the Moon."""

01:17:30;01:17:32;"Did you have any songs that came to mind, Jake?"

01:17:33;01:17:35;"but I wanna hear what you got to say."
01:17:35;01:17:38;"- Okay, well, in terms of a talking head song"
01:17:38;01:17:41;"that made me think of the dead a little bit,"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"it's funny that Byrne was at that show in '86"
01:17:43;01:17:46;"'cause I chose a song off their True Stories album,"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"which was from '86."
01:17:48;01:17:51;"The song City of Dreams."
01:17:51;01:17:53;"If you could bring that up, Matt."
01:17:53;01:17:54;"That's the last song on that record."
01:17:54;01:17:55;"And it's sort of like, yeah,"
01:17:55;01:17:56;"I don't think of the Talking Heads"
01:17:56;01:17:59;"as doing a lot of like acoustic Americana stuff,"
01:17:59;01:18:02;"but I do feel like late period dead in the '80s"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"and also kind of late period Talking Heads,"
01:18:04;01:18:09;"they kind of met in a similar aesthetic production."
01:18:09;01:18:10;"- I was saying that."
01:18:10;01:18:10;"- Yeah."

01:18:15;01:18:16;"Again, very driving beat here."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"Not very dead, the beat."
01:18:19;01:18:23;"But the chord progression is like late Garcia Hunter."
01:18:23;01:18:25;"- Oh yeah, totally."

01:20:21;01:20:22;"Do you like this record?"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"The True Stories record?"
01:20:24;01:20:25;"Do you know it?"
01:20:25;01:20:29;"- I went back on Adam Scott and Scott Aukerman's podcast"
01:20:29;01:20:30;"that we did."
01:20:30;01:20:33;"They asked me to come back to talk about this album"
01:20:33;01:20:36;"because they shifted from REM to Talking Heads"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"and they were kind of like,"
01:20:38;01:20:39;"oh, would you do the show?"
01:20:39;01:20:40;"And do you like Talking Heads?"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"I said, yeah, yeah, I love Talking Heads."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"And they were like, okay,"
01:20:43;01:20:46;"well the only album left is True Stories."
01:20:46;01:20:47;"And I was like, all right, it's kind of deep."
01:20:47;01:20:49;"Could be fun to revisit it."
01:20:49;01:20:50;"- Yeah."
01:20:50;01:20:53;"- That and the one after Naked."
01:20:53;01:20:54;"- The one from '88."
01:20:54;01:20:56;"- Yeah, those are both like the,"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"probably the most poorly regarded Talking Heads albums."
01:20:58;01:21:00;"But one thing to their credit,"
01:21:00;01:21:03;"they always had solid songs on every record."
01:21:03;01:21:05;"So that record that True Stories,"
01:21:05;01:21:06;"that City of Dreams is from,"
01:21:06;01:21:09;"it had like a pretty big hit, Wild Wild Life."
01:21:09;01:21:10;"- Yeah."
01:21:10;01:21:13;"- Which is just like, you know, a solid, fun song."
01:21:13;01:21:15;"- There's a song on there called Dream Operator 2,"
01:21:15;01:21:17;"which was one of my favorite Talking Heads songs."
01:21:17;01:21:20;"I feel like a couple of their most beautiful songs"
01:21:20;01:21:21;"are on this record."
01:21:21;01:21:22;"- Yeah."
01:21:22;01:21:24;"- It's a little more straightforward or something."
01:21:24;01:21:25;"- Yes, I think."
01:21:25;01:21:29;"- But again, that's where the dead and the heads"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"were starting to maybe meet in a common place."
01:21:31;01:21:33;"And I wonder what,"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"if that was maybe an intuition that Burn had"
01:21:35;01:21:38;"that took him to that show at Berklee in '86."
01:21:38;01:21:40;"- Interesting."
01:21:40;01:21:41;"- Maybe he started hearing dead a little bit"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"and he's like, ""Ooh, maybe I have something in common"
01:21:43;01:21:45;"""with these guys."""
01:21:45;01:21:46;"Maybe he always loved them, we don't know."
01:21:46;01:21:48;"Gotta get them on the show."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"- Yeah."
01:21:49;01:21:52;"- Noel Gallagher, first hour, David Burn, second hour."
01:21:52;01:21:56;"- Be funny if we just keep this going for a few episodes,"
01:21:56;01:21:58;"speculating on what bands Noel Gallagher would get"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"and then finally we get the big news,"
01:22:00;01:22:01;"like, ""Guys, Noel's in."""
01:22:01;01:22:03;"Be like, ""You know what?"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"""We kinda did it."""
01:22:05;01:22:07;"- Thanks, but no thanks, Noel."
01:22:07;01:22:08;"Like, we kinda covered,"
01:22:08;01:22:10;"we hypothetically asked you about every band"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"we could think of."
01:22:12;01:22:13;"So we're good, man."
01:22:13;01:22:14;"But keep on rocking, dude."
01:22:14;01:22:16;"- The fantasy was, it's more fun."
01:22:16;01:22:19;"I actually met David Burn once"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"because my brother worked with him."
01:22:21;01:22:22;"- Oh, right, yeah."
01:22:22;01:22:24;"- They recorded a song together"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"and they played some music together,"
01:22:26;01:22:29;"but then I did like a solo art painting exhibition"
01:22:29;01:22:32;"in New York in 2013."
01:22:32;01:22:33;"And my brother was still living there"
01:22:33;01:22:37;"and he told David Burn to go to my opening."
01:22:37;01:22:38;"- Sick."
01:22:38;01:22:40;"- And I was like, ""Oh, cool, that'd be sick."""
01:22:40;01:22:43;"And then I was there, it was kind of early in the opening,"
01:22:43;01:22:46;"no one was really there yet, including my brother."
01:22:46;01:22:49;"And I saw David Burn roll up on his bicycle."
01:22:49;01:22:52;"And it was in this tiny little gallery on the Lower East Side"
01:22:52;01:22:53;"and David Burn rolled in."
01:22:53;01:22:55;"And it was like me and the gallerist"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"and two other people."
01:22:57;01:23:00;"And I admit, David Burn maybe in passing"
01:23:00;01:23:02;"for 10 seconds once with my brother a year ago."
01:23:02;01:23:05;"So he didn't remember me, but he was just going."
01:23:05;01:23:08;"And the gallerist was looking at me like,"
01:23:08;01:23:11;"""Why is David Burn, why did he just walk into here?"
01:23:11;01:23:12;"This is my little gallery."""
01:23:12;01:23:14;"And I just went up to David Burn and I was like,"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"""Hey, I'm Jake, I'm Dave's brother."
01:23:16;01:23:19;"Thanks for coming, man, nice to meet you."""
01:23:19;01:23:20;"He's like, ""These paintings look good."""
01:23:20;01:23:21;"- Oh, that's cool. - He stood there."
01:23:21;01:23:25;"It was just classic, awkward early art opening."
01:23:25;01:23:30;"There's no, a very stilted social situation."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"And then he was there for a few minutes"
01:23:32;01:23:33;"and then he bounced."

01:33:31;01:33:32;"Exactly."
01:33:32;01:33:36;"But I tore through the first two bottles on eggs"
01:33:36;01:33:39;"and like pizza crust and whatever, just like loving it."
01:33:39;01:33:42;"- Shout out to the killers and their hot sauce."
01:33:42;01:33:43;"- Nick, it was hot, but it was flavorful."
01:33:43;01:33:47;"And I'm worried about the last two becoming a little too hot"
01:33:47;01:33:50;"and not flavorful enough, but we'll see."

01:34:01;01:34:04;"- That David Byrne attended a Grateful Dead show."
01:34:04;01:34:07;"This is like maybe the most in the weeds,"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"quote, reason for doing a top five."

01:34:11;01:34:15;"It's the year that David Byrne attended a dead show"
01:34:15;01:34:18;"at the University of California at Berkeley."
01:34:18;01:34:21;"It was live broadcast on KPFA,"
01:34:21;01:34:24;"which I love, during a 14-hour dead-a-thon"
01:34:24;01:34:27;"as a fundraiser for the station."
01:34:27;01:34:29;"- And please, if anybody can help us,"
01:34:29;01:34:32;"if you can find, not the audio of the show,"
01:34:32;01:34:34;"that's easily accessible on archive,"
01:34:34;01:34:38;"but the interview that Byrne and Bob Weir"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"seem to have done together."
01:34:40;01:34:43;"Maybe anybody has access to the KFPA archives,"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"that'd be great to check out."
01:34:45;01:34:49;"Okay, 1986, the number five song, ""In Excess, What You Need."""
01:34:51;01:34:54;"- I still feel like I know very, very little about ""In Excess."""
01:34:54;01:34:56;"- Yeah, I haven't gone deep on this band."
01:34:56;01:34:59;"I mean-- - I know the ""Need You Tonight,"""

01:45:04;01:45:08;"in the 20th century and then at some point,"
01:45:08;01:45:10;"it starts eating itself and like--"
01:45:10;01:45:11;"- Right."
01:45:11;01:45:12;"And it's no coincidence--"
01:45:12;01:45:13;"- Like the first--"
01:45:13;01:45:15;"- That that corresponds with the internet"
01:45:15;01:45:18;"casting this whole new way that people interact"
01:45:18;01:45:21;"with each other and perceive the past and information."
01:45:21;01:45:22;"- Yes."
01:45:22;01:45:24;"- That obviously is a huge part of it."
01:45:24;01:45:25;"- Well, then my brother wrote back, he goes,"
01:45:25;01:45:29;"pessimistic, he discounts that a constantly changing world"
01:45:29;01:45:31;"imbues the same styles with different meanings"
01:45:31;01:45:33;"at different times."
01:45:33;01:45:34;"Who is Dean Kisic?"
01:45:34;01:45:38;"Which I think is a great call on my brother's part."
01:45:38;01:45:38;"It's sort of like--"
01:45:38;01:45:41;"- And I bet they might not actually be disagreeing"
01:45:41;01:45:42;"with each other in that sense."
01:45:42;01:45:44;"- Right."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"- This is the Dean Kisic quote."
01:45:46;01:45:47;"It's funny, we don't really know who this dude is,"
01:45:47;01:45:51;"but I was just on some website and I clicked on an article"
01:45:51;01:45:53;"that he wrote and this part stood out to me"
01:45:53;01:45:55;"as being very TC."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"There's just too much of everything."
01:45:57;01:45:58;"There are too many different Oreos."
01:45:58;01:46:01;"65 flavors in eight years is too many."
01:46:01;01:46:04;"Too many hot chicken wing Oreos, waffle and syrup Oreos,"
01:46:04;01:46:07;"jelly donut Oreos, supreme Oreos."
01:46:07;01:46:09;"There's too much content that appears different"
01:46:09;01:46:10;"but is the same."
01:46:10;01:46:12;"Too many identities are available to us."
01:46:12;01:46:14;"Too many manias, too many hysterias."
01:46:14;01:46:16;"Examine nearly any aspect of society"
01:46:16;01:46:18;"and you can see it's gone too far."
01:46:18;01:46:21;"The reason so many flavors of Oreos are invented,"
01:46:21;01:46:23;"according to the cookie's brand director,"
01:46:23;01:46:26;"is that this overabundance of choice"
01:46:26;01:46:29;"reminds us of and drives us back to the original."
01:46:29;01:46:32;"It reminds us of how much we like the old Oreo,"
01:46:32;01:46:35;"the platonic ideal of the Oreos of childhood."
01:46:35;01:46:38;"The Proustian Oreo with a glass of cold milk."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"When there's too much of everything, however,"
01:46:39;01:46:41;"at some point the original is lost."
01:46:41;01:46:43;"The memory is lost and all that remains"
01:46:43;01:46:46;"are faded, flat, hollowed out derivatives."
01:46:46;01:46:47;"So pretty complimentary, I think."
01:46:47;01:46:49;"- Why didn't you send that to the thread?"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"- I think I just forgot."
01:46:51;01:46:53;"- Get this guy on the show."
01:46:53;01:46:55;"- It's very Adam Curtis, too."
01:46:55;01:46:58;"- It intersects a lot, too, with Mark Fisher,"
01:46:58;01:47:02;"the writer, the K-punk dude a lot of people like digging."
01:47:02;01:47:05;"And I think everybody, even if people"
01:47:05;01:47:08;"have a different point of view, Dave or Dean Kisic,"
01:47:08;01:47:12;"Mark Fisher, the Oreos creative brand director,"
01:47:12;01:47:14;"it's like people might have a different interpretation,"
01:47:14;01:47:18;"but there definitely seems to be a unanimous feeling"
01:47:18;01:47:23;"that we're in some sort of exhausted, weird moment."
01:47:23;01:47:25;"And that has something to do with being"
01:47:25;01:47:29;"at the end of history, the internet,"
01:47:29;01:47:34;"too much of everything, the past being picked over infinitely."
01:47:34;01:47:37;"Like it's all pointing towards, whatever your take is,"
01:47:37;01:47:40;"there's something, a feeling coming together."
01:47:40;01:47:41;"- Yeah, it's funny with like, if you're talking"
01:47:41;01:47:43;"about music, like the rock and roll form"
01:47:43;01:47:45;"is like, what, 70 years old?"
01:47:45;01:47:49;"All of the major ideas were explored in the first 20 years,"
01:47:49;01:47:52;"from the mid-50s to like, let's say 25 years,"
01:47:52;01:47:55;"mid-50s to like the early 80s."
01:47:55;01:47:56;"And then since then, the last 40--"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"- That roughly covers it."
01:47:58;01:48:00;"And then hip hop-- - Roughly 40 something,"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"of course, I'm talking about rock, though, but yes."
01:48:02;01:48:04;"- No, and then-- - But hip hop's already--"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"- And then hip hop had its 30 years."
01:48:06;01:48:09;"If you want to be generous with both, you could say 35,"
01:48:09;01:48:13;"and then hip hop's had its 35 years, and we'll see."
01:48:13;01:48:16;"But I think one thing that a lot of these cultural critics"
01:48:16;01:48:18;"don't really take into account when they talk about"
01:48:18;01:48:21;"the exhausted art forms of the past"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"and how they're picked over infinitely,"
01:48:23;01:48:28;"is that yes, it's very difficult to make interesting music"
01:48:28;01:48:32;"in the rock form in the modern day,"
01:48:32;01:48:36;"but there are these kind of meta art forms,"
01:48:36;01:48:40;"in a Borghesean fashion, I'm not ashamed to say,"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"such as internet radio,"
01:48:42;01:48:46;"that radically recontextualizes the past."
01:48:46;01:48:51;"And maybe people who are feeling a little bit bummed out"
01:48:51;01:48:55;"about where music's at, they should dig a little deeper"
01:48:55;01:48:57;"into the exciting world of internet radio,"
01:48:57;01:49:00;"because then you get people will be talking"
01:49:00;01:49:03;"about the Grateful Dead and talking heads,"
01:49:03;01:49:06;"and use that as a jumping off point"
01:49:06;01:49:08;"to talk, no, actually, I don't,"
01:49:08;01:49:10;"do we actually use that as a jumping off point"
01:49:10;01:49:11;"to talk about something else?"
01:49:11;01:49:13;"I'm done with this bit, actually."
01:49:13;01:49:14;"But there's a little something to it."
01:49:14;01:49:16;"- I just kept thinking of my old coworker"
01:49:16;01:49:19;"crushing that Chipotle burrito going,"
01:49:19;01:49:20;"it's rocks played out, dog."
01:49:20;01:49:21;"- Well, the truth is--"
01:49:21;01:49:22;"- And that was 10 years ago."
01:49:22;01:49:25;"- That was 10 years ago, but think about how often"
01:49:25;01:49:28;"we reference that great story that you told us,"
01:49:28;01:49:31;"because-- - Great story."
01:49:31;01:49:33;"- In that moment, your coworker crushing the burrito"
01:49:33;01:49:35;"and saying rocks played out,"
01:49:35;01:49:39;"he thought that he was bringing this pessimistic energy"
01:49:39;01:49:41;"and just being like, damn, man, it's sad, but it's over."
01:49:41;01:49:44;"Little did he know that by saying that,"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"he was opening up a whole new universe of art."
01:49:46;01:49:49;"He was the artist in that moment."
01:49:49;01:49:52;"What your coworker did by crushing that burrito"
01:49:52;01:49:53;"and saying rocks played out, dog,"
01:49:53;01:49:57;"in a strange way is the equivalent"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"of Chuck Berry picking up a guitar for the first time."
01:49:59;01:50:02;"It opened up a whole new universe of possibilities"
01:50:02;01:50:07;"of aesthetic fault lines, I don't know."
01:50:07;01:50:09;"- Yeah, if you're working with the same chord progressions,"
01:50:09;01:50:12;"I just, I don't, I remember in the '90s,"
01:50:12;01:50:16;"it was like rocks dead, like electronic is the future,"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"but it's still the same chord progressions,"
01:50:18;01:50:21;"so it's sort of like, it was window dressing"
01:50:21;01:50:23;"at the end of the day, so it's sort of like--"
01:50:23;01:50:24;"- And then also, you know, you could get in"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"some deep, crazy fusion, but it's like,"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"how different do you really want the chord progressions"
01:50:28;01:50:29;"to be?"
01:50:29;01:50:31;"- You don't, you don't want them to be that different."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"The one thing I've never really heard anyone say"
01:50:33;01:50:36;"is that however you, like you said,"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"it's window dressing for an emotion."
01:50:38;01:50:41;"No one's ever like, fiction's played out, dog."
01:50:41;01:50:44;"- People, I think people say that sometimes."
01:50:44;01:50:45;"- Yeah, I do think people have said, yeah,"
01:50:45;01:50:47;"and then they move here and there,"
01:50:47;01:50:49;"but no one's giving up on the entire idea"
01:50:49;01:50:54;"of fictionalized writing and imagination."
01:50:54;01:50:56;"Like, they're just saying this is a vehicle"
01:50:56;01:50:58;"for telling a story or an emotion,"
01:50:58;01:51:02;"and maybe some of the limits of rock allow for that."
01:51:02;01:51:05;"I mean, I do think when we talk about hip hop"
01:51:05;01:51:08;"or rap specifically, it's because it's so born out"
01:51:08;01:51:11;"of like, using technology, it allows itself"
01:51:11;01:51:14;"to like, kind of constantly morph."
01:51:14;01:51:15;"You know, it's like, oh, we can sample,"
01:51:15;01:51:19;"or oh, we have a midi, like it's born out of an ability"
01:51:19;01:51:22;"to kind of keep redefining itself,"
01:51:22;01:51:24;"but rock would just like, hey, yeah,"
01:51:24;01:51:26;"we can like, tell a story or an emotion."
01:51:26;01:51:31;"That should be kind of evergreen if done well, like writing."
01:51:31;01:51:33;"And I do think, yeah, you hear people go,"
01:51:33;01:51:36;"I'm not reading, I'm reading more nonfiction now."
01:51:36;01:51:38;"But no one literally is like,"
01:51:38;01:51:40;"people should stop making up stories."
01:51:40;01:51:42;"- I think people should stop making up stories."
01:51:42;01:51:43;"(laughing)"
01:51:43;01:51:44;"There's enough already."
01:51:44;01:51:49;"- Okay, well, if you, yes, if you take that stance, then--"
01:51:49;01:51:50;"- We're really getting deep now,"
01:51:50;01:51:53;"but also, one thing for sure is that,"
01:51:53;01:51:55;"and I've seen people make this point before."
01:51:55;01:51:58;"I'm not taking issue with any one quote in particular,"
01:51:58;01:52:03;"but when people get really intense or dismissive"
01:52:03;01:52:06;"about the fact that art forms are not innovating"
01:52:06;01:52:09;"at the rate that they once did,"
01:52:09;01:52:14;"they are also betraying their own allegiance in a meta way"
01:52:14;01:52:18;"to a 20th century model of how art is supposed to progress."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"You know what I mean?"
01:52:20;01:52:21;"So it's like-- - Yes, I do."
01:52:21;01:52:23;"- So the dude who's crushing the burrito,"
01:52:23;01:52:26;"who, yeah, I recently was just referring to him"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"as being a type of visionary hero of sorts,"
01:52:28;01:52:31;"but I'm gonna take the alternate view now."
01:52:31;01:52:32;"When he says rock's played out,"
01:52:32;01:52:37;"he's being a very much a 20th century kinda hater"
01:52:37;01:52:40;"who expects things to click along at a certain rate."
01:52:40;01:52:43;"He expects a new guitar tone ASAP."
01:52:43;01:52:45;"He expects some new vibe, you know?"
01:52:45;01:52:48;"And the question that I would ask,"
01:52:48;01:52:51;"why is it so odious to be played out, dog?"
01:52:51;01:52:53;"Which a lot of people don't know."
01:52:53;01:52:54;"That's what Jake said back to him."
01:52:54;01:52:56;"As the dude crushed the burrito,"
01:52:56;01:52:58;"we've never, for the first time ever,"
01:52:58;01:53:00;"we're revealing the rest of the conversation."
01:53:00;01:53:02;"Jake turned to him. (laughs)"
01:53:02;01:53:04;"The guy said, ""Rock's played out, dog."""
01:53:04;01:53:05;"And Jake turned to him and said,"
01:53:05;01:53:10;"""Sir, I must ask, what is so odious about being played out?"""
01:53:10;01:53:15;"I said to him, I said, ""Sir, we're both visual artists."
01:53:15;01:53:17;"""We're both painters."
01:53:17;01:53:20;"""Talk about played out, sir."
01:53:20;01:53:25;"""There's been millenia, literally millennia of painting."""
01:53:25;01:53:27;"- It's a little bit Jim Morrison."
01:53:27;01:53:28;"- Oh, very much."
01:53:28;01:53:31;"Shall I lay down my paintbrushes?"
01:53:31;01:53:33;"'Cause what you described as so odious,"
01:53:33;01:53:35;"this feeling of being played out,"
01:53:35;01:53:39;"for me, when I feel played out, I feel powerful."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"I feel like a bear."
01:53:41;01:53:43;"I feel like late period Jim Morrison,"
01:53:43;01:53:45;"comfortable in my own skin."
01:53:45;01:53:50;"I mean, yeah, you're right about people"
01:53:50;01:53:52;"becoming beholden to the 20th century model"
01:53:52;01:53:55;"because the decades after World War II"
01:53:55;01:53:58;"were a unique time in history"
01:53:58;01:54:02;"where there were vastly new material conditions"
01:54:02;01:54:04;"in which new art could arise out of,"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"which we're still basically in."
01:54:06;01:54:10;"In the '50s and '60s after World War II,"
01:54:10;01:54:13;"there was this massively affluent consumer society"
01:54:13;01:54:18;"of cars and parking lots and supermarkets and radio and TV."
01:54:18;01:54:20;"- Baseball diamonds. - And that's when rock and roll started."
01:54:20;01:54:22;"Baseball diamonds."
01:54:22;01:54:24;"And we're still kind of in that world."
01:54:24;01:54:25;"We have the internet now,"
01:54:25;01:54:28;"but we're still in that world of shopping centers"
01:54:28;01:54:31;"and cars and TV and mass media,"
01:54:31;01:54:35;"which was the groundwork that rock and roll came out of."
01:54:35;01:54:37;"So I think unless there's absolute,"
01:54:37;01:54:42;"it has to be fully cataclysmic societal destruction"
01:54:42;01:54:46;"and then rebirth to actually get truly new forms of art."
01:54:46;01:54:47;"That's what I think."
01:54:47;01:54:48;"I don't wanna live through that."
01:54:48;01:54:53;"So I'm fine with just people recapitulating"
01:54:53;01:54:57;"and re-digesting rock and roll from 50 years ago."
01:54:57;01:55:00;"- I think you might be talking about the singularity."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"- Maybe I am."
01:55:01;01:55:02;"- Like the singularity happens"
01:55:02;01:55:05;"and then all sorts of new genres."
01:55:05;01:55:06;"- I think we have to live"
01:55:06;01:55:09;"in a completely different material world"
01:55:09;01:55:11;"for truly new forms to come out of."
01:55:11;01:55:13;"It's not gonna just happen."
01:55:13;01:55:15;"- Do you want a new form?"
01:55:15;01:55:16;"- Well, no, that's what I'm saying."
01:55:16;01:55:19;"The cost of a new form is a full cataclysmic destruction"
01:55:19;01:55:22;"of society and then a rebuilding."
01:55:22;01:55:22;"I don't want that."
01:55:22;01:55:24;"- You don't, okay."
01:55:24;01:55:27;"- I don't care about new forms of art enough."
01:55:27;01:55:30;"- This is gonna be the plot of our Avengers movie"
01:55:30;01:55:34;"is that an evil warlord who is so distraught"
01:55:34;01:55:37;"that rock is played out recognizes"
01:55:37;01:55:41;"that the only way for a new vibe in rock to happen"
01:55:41;01:55:44;"will be a cataclysmic destruction of society."
01:55:44;01:55:46;"So he goes and gets all the Thanos rings"
01:55:46;01:55:48;"and the only person who can stop him is Jake."
01:55:48;01:55:51;"Jake assembles the rest of the crisis crew"
01:55:51;01:55:53;"to be like, it's not worth it, man."
01:55:53;01:55:56;"You can just go listen to old Grateful Dead shows."
01:55:56;01:55:58;"Who gives a (beep)"
01:55:58;01:56:00;"Dude, it's not worth it."
01:56:00;01:56:04;"- It's not worth the human misery to create new art forms."
01:56:04;01:56:08;"It's just like, let's just start Grateful Dead cover bands."
01:56:08;01:56:12;"- It's a cataclysmic destruction of society."
01:56:12;01:56:14;"- Well, think about the world pre-World War II"
01:56:14;01:56:15;"and post-World War II."
01:56:15;01:56:17;"Pre-World War II is like the depression."
01:56:17;01:56:19;"It's like, after World War II,"
01:56:19;01:56:23;"it's like gleaming supermarkets and like mad men."
01:56:23;01:56:25;"I mean, at least I wasn't alive then, obviously,"
01:56:25;01:56:28;"but that's my like narrativized vision"
01:56:28;01:56:29;"of those different eras. - No, and as people"
01:56:29;01:56:31;"have pointed out, the post-war prosperity"
01:56:31;01:56:36;"of the United States was something never before seen"
01:56:36;01:56:41;"in human society and perhaps will never be seen again."
01:56:41;01:56:45;"Even when people describe the rise of China and all that,"
01:56:45;01:56:49;"the specific weird elements that went into the end"
01:56:49;01:56:53;"of the war, the raw materials that were found"
01:56:53;01:56:56;"in this country, the mix of immigrants and stuff,"
01:56:56;01:56:59;"just like the US pulled ahead in such a crazy way"
01:56:59;01:57:03;"in that era that it's possible that no country"
01:57:03;01:57:06;"on earth will ever quite have that type"
01:57:06;01:57:09;"of like unbelievable journey."
01:57:09;01:57:10;"- Stew."
01:57:10;01:57:12;"- Stew ever again."
01:57:12;01:57:13;"- Yeah."
01:57:13;01:57:17;"The way I see it is that Seinfeld's searching the internet"
01:57:17;01:57:20;"and he sort of writes the text thread and says,"
01:57:20;01:57:22;"guys, I found a new chord."
01:57:22;01:57:26;"I think that we can change music."
01:57:26;01:57:28;"And he's sort of, you know, he's (beep) around"
01:57:28;01:57:30;"and he sort of grows in power."
01:57:30;01:57:33;"And that's when Jake has to come in and say,"
01:57:33;01:57:34;"like, you can't do it."
01:57:34;01:57:35;"That's the Thanos thing."
01:57:35;01:57:41;"And we could change music, but it would ultimately be--"
01:57:41;01:57:43;"- I haven't seen it, but I think you might've, Nick,"
01:57:43;01:57:44;"maybe with your son, this is the plot"
01:57:44;01:57:47;"of ""Trolls 2"" world tour, correct?"
01:57:47;01:57:49;"(laughing)"
01:57:49;01:57:52;"- It's so deeply embedded."
01:57:52;01:57:54;"Yeah, yeah."
01:57:54;01:57:56;"I think that I sort of on my own came up"
01:57:56;01:57:58;"with the plot of ""Trolls 2."""
01:57:58;01:58:01;"- But this is ""Trolls 2"" for adults."
01:58:01;01:58:03;"- But I think ultimately everyone has to get together."
01:58:03;01:58:06;"There's no one in there that has Jake's point of view,"
01:58:06;01:58:08;"which I really like, which is you could,"
01:58:08;01:58:11;"which is that sort of eventually you can use that power,"
01:58:11;01:58:13;"but at what cost?"
01:58:13;01:58:14;"- Yeah."
01:58:14;01:58:16;"And the last thing I'll say that's always worth"
01:58:16;01:58:18;"keeping in mind is as much as the Grateful Dead"
01:58:18;01:58:21;"represent the spirit of the '60s,"
01:58:21;01:58:22;"and we can look through their discography"
01:58:22;01:58:25;"and see all these innovative things they did,"
01:58:25;01:58:28;"and that we can say that album sounds like '68,"
01:58:28;01:58:33;"that (beep) sounds like '78, '86, whatever."
01:58:33;01:58:36;"At the end of the day, the young Jerry Garcia,"
01:58:36;01:58:39;"Robert Hunter, these people in Northern California,"
01:58:39;01:58:42;"they were born during World War II."
01:58:42;01:58:45;"They grew up in the '50s prosperity era,"
01:58:45;01:58:47;"and part of the culture that they were in,"
01:58:47;01:58:52;"the folk music revival, the pre-hippie whatever,"
01:58:52;01:58:55;"was a little bit about looking around at modern America"
01:58:55;01:58:59;"with all the bells and whistles and being like,"
01:58:59;01:59:01;"""I don't know about all this."""
01:59:01;01:59:03;"It was a little bit about digging into the past."
01:59:03;01:59:08;"Like in the Jerry Garcia, some time in the early days,"
01:59:08;01:59:10;"took a lot of acid, he had this real (beep) up experience"
01:59:10;01:59:12;"where he was in Northern California,"
01:59:12;01:59:16;"and he really had this deep feeling of horror"
01:59:16;01:59:19;"when he realized that he was on Native American land,"
01:59:19;01:59:21;"and he thought about all the bloodshed that had happened,"
01:59:21;01:59:23;"something that I'm sure is very easy to ignore"
01:59:23;01:59:25;"growing up in '50s America."
01:59:25;01:59:28;"And he had this weird feeling of the darkness"
01:59:28;01:59:31;"that modern America was built on."
01:59:31;01:59:34;"So it's worth considering that this dude,"
01:59:34;01:59:37;"they were taking acid not to build the future"
01:59:37;01:59:40;"in the sense of technological progress,"
01:59:40;01:59:42;"they're exploring their minds,"
01:59:42;01:59:44;"and then spending hours and hours every day"
01:59:44;01:59:47;"learning how to shred bluegrass banjo music."
01:59:47;01:59:49;"You know what I mean?"
01:59:49;01:59:52;"So it's like the idea that you can't dig deeply"
01:59:52;01:59:57;"into the past as a way of understanding life"
01:59:57;02:00:00;"and centering yourself, and that you need to be committed"
02:00:00;02:00:04;"to what's fresh and new and not played out,"
02:00:04;02:00:07;"it's also a bit of a misunderstanding, I think."
02:00:07;02:00:10;"Like, and I guess bluegrass probably seemed kind of cool"
02:00:10;02:00:12;"in their circles, but just again,"
02:00:12;02:00:15;"visualize this guy from Northern California"
02:00:15;02:00:17;"spending hours and hours every day"
02:00:17;02:00:20;"just learning the technical aspects"
02:00:20;02:00:23;"of this old music, bluegrass,"
02:00:23;02:00:25;"literally digging into the past"
02:00:25;02:00:29;"in the prime period of exciting new music."
02:00:29;02:00:31;"There's some kind of lesson there."
02:00:31;02:00:33;"- Oh, absolutely, yeah, fully agree."
02:00:33;02:00:36;"I mean, if you're obsessed with the future,"
02:00:36;02:00:38;"you'll be a futurist."
02:00:38;02:00:39;"- Yeah. - And you know,"
02:00:39;02:00:42;"that was like a movement of painters in Italy in the '20s,"
02:00:42;02:00:47;"and you see that stuff, it's very dated, not alive."
02:00:47;02:00:48;"It's like the Jetsons or something."
02:00:48;02:00:51;"It's just like, okay, yeah, the future, cool."
02:00:51;02:00:54;"- The Italian futurists did not produce the Europe '72."
02:00:54;02:00:55;"- No, they did not."
02:00:55;02:00:58;"- And they're from Europe, so that's just sad."
02:00:58;02:00:59;"(laughing)"
02:00:59;02:01:01;"They're actually Europeans."
02:01:01;02:01:02;"All right, hold on, we gotta get down to--"
02:01:02;02:01:04;"- Where are we on this top five?"
02:01:04;02:01:06;"- Okay, okay. - I was just writing that."
02:01:06;02:01:07;"- The number two song. - We got two more."
02:01:07;02:01:08;"- All right, check this out."
02:01:08;02:01:11;"The number two song, ""Prince and the Revolution,"" ""Kiss."""
02:01:11;02:01:13;"Wow, Prince is just killing it."

02:01:27;02:01:28;"Excellent song."
02:01:28;02:01:30;"Rest in peace, Prince."
02:01:30;02:01:33;"This is probably far and away the best song on the top five."
02:01:33;02:01:35;"And the number one song,"
02:01:35;02:01:38;"Falco, ""Rock Me Amadeus."""

02:01:56;02:01:59;"Falco, the artist, said the inspiration behind the song was,"

02:02:13;02:02:14;"This is terrible."
02:02:14;02:02:16;"- Basically a German rap song."
02:02:16;02:02:18;"- This is rough."
02:02:18;02:02:20;"- This is truly rough stuff."
02:02:20;02:02:27;"- Well, you know, speaking of German bands,"
02:02:27;02:02:29;"Ezra, I think I texted you a few weeks ago"
02:02:29;02:02:31;"or a month ago or something about--"

02:02:45;02:02:52;"Damn."
02:02:52;02:02:56;"- I think maybe it's like the video"
02:02:56;02:02:57;"probably got a lot of MTV play."
02:02:57;02:02:59;"It was probably funny."
02:02:59;02:03:01;"People were, the movie ""Amadeus,"""

02:03:11;02:03:13;"- Solid film. - Yes, '84."
02:03:13;02:03:15;"- Okay, yes, and this is '86."
02:03:15;02:03:16;"- I almost feel like,"
02:03:16;02:03:18;"is there like a German producer connection"
02:03:18;02:03:20;"with Milli Vanilli?"
02:03:20;02:03:21;"- Yeah, they were German."
02:03:21;02:03:22;"- Oh, they were, okay."
02:03:22;02:03:25;"Something about that guy's flow"
02:03:25;02:03:30;"was reminding me of Milli Vanilli,"
02:03:30;02:03:31;"who had much better songs, by the way."

02:03:43;02:03:46;"- Yeah, and there's a whole story about it,"
02:03:46;02:03:48;"about his debts, and it's very biographical."
02:03:48;02:03:51;"- Okay, so I can understand why in Germany"
