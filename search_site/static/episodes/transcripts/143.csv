00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, back again. Jake returns to tell us about Pasadena Hospital food,"
00:07;00:14;"the birth of Subway, The Beatles, and so much more. We dip our toes into Tampa Bay,"
00:14;00:23;"discuss Herman's Hermits, and other great music. Reunited, together again, this is"
00:23;00:30;"Time Crisis, with Ezra Koenig."
01:13;01:20;"Time Crisis, back again. Jake, welcome back to the show."
01:20;01:22;"Great to be here, great to be here."
01:22;01:28;"Really was missing you on the last step, really could have used you as we went toe-to-toe with Robert Rosenberg."
01:28;01:29;"How was the interview?"
01:29;01:35;"It was solid, he's a great dude. He was down to talk about the whole Dunkin' Donuts story."
01:35;01:40;"A lot of nuggets of wisdom, but of course you had bigger fish to fry, we understand."
01:40;01:44;"Might have been weird for you to drop everything while you were at the hospital."
01:44;01:48;"Although you did attempt to have me call in."
01:48;01:51;"Right, we wondered if we could get you on the phone for like a tight 15."
01:51;01:57;"And I was like, I can't do it guys. Yeah, because Hannah was literally in labor at that point,"
01:57;01:59;"because you guys were taping on a Wednesday."
01:59;02:00;"Right."
02:00;02:04;"You know, I think our daughter was born during the taping of TC."
02:04;02:09;"Because she was born at 6.30, two Wednesdays ago, which we usually tape on a Wednesday."
02:09;02:11;"Oh, so it's definitely possible."
02:11;02:12;"I mean, that feels cosmic."
02:12;02:14;"Yeah, deeply."
02:14;02:21;"But yeah, I couldn't make it to the phone to weigh in on the minutiae of the Dunkin' book."
02:21;02:24;"Can you guys keep it down? I'm on the phone with Robert Rosenberg."
02:24;02:27;"Guys, chill out."
02:27;02:36;"Well, we were talking before the show, and it wouldn't be too TC to get like super personal about the beautiful miracle of life type thing."
02:36;02:37;"Absolutely not."
02:37;02:49;"But the TC angle to your experience is not to talk about your child or the beautiful life affirming experience."
02:49;02:55;"You and your partner shared the TC way in and say, you were roaming the halls of a hospital for five days."
02:55;02:59;"What the hell were you eating? What's going on over there, man?"
02:59;03:03;"Well, first of all, I wasn't roaming the halls because of COVID."
03:03;03:12;"We were stuck in our hospital room, and we went in on a Monday evening and left on a Saturday morning with our baby daughter."
03:12;03:15;"So, we were in there for five nights."
03:15;03:16;"Whoa."
03:16;03:26;"We were in the hospital room. Ordinarily, I think you could probably leave the hospital, walk across the street, get a coffee, pick up some groceries, maybe get some
takeout, go back to the hospital."
03:26;03:28;"But in this situation, no dice."
03:28;03:34;"So, we were ordering off the Huntington Hospital cafeteria menu for those five days."
03:34;03:36;"You couldn't even go to the cafeteria?"
03:36;03:40;"No, it was all, you would call in the order, and they would bring it to you."
03:40;03:42;"Just getting that hospital room service?"
03:42;03:48;"I literally could not pace the halls. I couldn't be a 1950s guy smoking a cigarette in the hall."
03:48;03:51;"""Oh, what's going on in there?"""
03:51;03:54;"Oh, man. I didn't realize it was that locked down."
03:54;03:56;"Extremely locked down."
03:56;03:59;"You were literally in one room for five days?"
03:59;04:04;"Well, two rooms, because the first two days, we were in the labor and delivery room."
04:04;04:10;"And then after the baby was born, they put us in a maternity room, and we were there for a few days."
04:10;04:15;"In addition to the food you're ordering, did you roll with like a go bag full of snacks?"
04:15;04:16;"Cliff bars."
04:16;04:17;"Modellos?"
04:17;04:22;"Didn't bring any brew. I didn't think that would be tone appropriate."
04:22;04:24;"Could you order a beer on -"
04:24;04:28;"No, there was no alcohol on the menu. I did look."
04:28;04:36;"I was reading somewhere before the birth, like reading some of the blog about like what their go bag was in the hospital."
04:36;04:39;"And someone was writing about like, ""Oh, man, I brought some beer."""
04:39;04:44;"But then I was like, ""Is it going to be a mini fridge in the hospital room?"""
04:44;04:47;"I'm not going to crack a lukewarm brew."
04:47;04:51;"I mean, even if there was a mini fridge, it just would have been in poor taste, I think."
04:51;04:58;"I'm sure there's people that do it. I'm sure there's people that roll in or like during normal times, not COVID times,"
04:58;05:01;"people like their buddy rolls in with like a 12 pack."
05:01;05:04;"I'm sure that happens. That would have been triumphant."
05:04;05:07;"Like people sneak in a bottle of champagne."
05:07;05:08;"Right."
05:08;05:13;"Actually, now that we're talking about it, doesn't that sound like a movie or something where like some dude gets shot"
05:13;05:16;"and then his like buddies go and hang out with him."
05:16;05:20;"He's like having a laugh and he's like, ""Oh!"" You know?"
05:20;05:24;"And they're like, somebody pulls out like a bottle of whiskey at the hospital."
05:24;05:27;"A little like a hospital party. That happens."
05:27;05:29;"Never participated in one."
05:29;05:38;"I feel like there's no context in which me sneaking booze into the hospital delivery room is going to work out well."
05:38;05:42;"I just, it's not a good look for me."
05:42;05:43;"Right."
05:43;05:44;"It's just like..."
05:44;05:45;"You're banned from the hospital?"
05:45;05:47;"It's just not a good vibe."
05:47;05:58;"I could be holding you tonight. I could quit doing wrong and start doing right."
05:58;06:09;"You don't care about what I think. Think I'll just stay here and drink."
06:09;06:20;"Hey, putting you down won't square the deal. At least you know the way I feel."
06:20;06:30;"Hey, take all the money in the bank. Think I'll just stay here and drink."
06:30;06:35;"Here's what I'll say off the top. The breakfast sandwich at Huntington Hospital, superb."
06:35;06:36;"Really?"
06:36;06:47;"It's like a homemade egg McMuffin. Fluffy, well scrambled eggs, a little slice of Canadian bacon, slice of melted cheese on an English muffin. Great."
06:47;06:51;"You're saying it's like as good as what you might expect at a kind of like artisanal cafe kind of vibe?"
06:51;06:55;"Oh, for sure. That is by far their standout item."
06:55;06:57;"Oh, that's tight."
06:57;06:59;"How late do they serve it to?"
06:59;07:04;"All day. Well, from like 6.30am to I think 7pm."
07:04;07:08;"Oh, really? Did you ever hit it for like multiple meals in one day?"
07:08;07:12;"Thought about it. Really, really considered it."
07:12;07:17;"I'm going to go wild, get the breakfast sandwich for lunch. Keep things interesting."
07:17;07:19;"And dinner, why not?"
07:19;07:24;"That's the Huntington Hospital triple crown is when you have the breakfast sandwich for all three meals."
07:24;07:29;"Yeah, like in the kitchen, they're just like, oh, yep, long stress, back in number three."
07:29;07:40;"That's tight because I actually associate like eggs as being a very simple, good thing that gets absolutely destroyed by industrial catering."
07:40;07:51;"I just have like memories of being someplace where they have like the giant metal tray of just like terrible, you know, scrambled eggs that they just make en masse."
07:51;07:56;"Yeah, like the color is like this, like sulfuric, like neon yellow."
07:56;08:00;"Yeah, or sometimes they get like gray. There's a kind of like gray scrambled eggs."
08:00;08:04;"But it just makes me think of some like being on like a ferry."
08:04;08:06;"I think those might be powdered eggs."
08:06;08:08;"Ah, yeah. Tastes terrible."
08:08;08:14;"OK, so at Bed Huntington, it sounds like some handmade crack the egg made to order."
08:14;08:17;"All right. So that was far and away the best item. Anything else good?"
08:17;08:20;"Yeah. Personal pan pizza, not bad."
08:20;08:26;"No, I don't think so, because each one was sort of irregular."
08:26;08:35;"Maybe like Papa John's style where they're like the cafeteria is buying cold dough, you know, like pre-made dough and then their hands stretching and topping."
08:35;08:45;"That's my guess. But when someone is going into labor at a certain point, the doctors restrict her food intake and she can only have like clear liquids, you know."
08:45;08:53;"So Hannah had not eaten in a while. And so as we were getting deep into the labor process, I was like, oh, I better get a food order in."
08:53;09:01;"I ordered a few pizzas that actually were delivered to the room during a pretty critical time in the delivery, which is also comical."
09:01;09:07;"It must happen to all the time with like the food people at these hospitals just like coming in at the weirdest times."
09:07;09:14;"But after our baby was born, we just like destroyed these personal pan pizzas."
09:14;09:20;"In case you're wondering, Ezra, Aramark does not supply the food at Huntington Hospital."
09:20;09:26;"Sounds like Huntington Hospital might be like an independent operation. Handmade breakfast sandwiches."
09:26;09:28;"Yeah. Pizza to order."
09:28;09:34;"Do you think people are just ever going there just for the food on its own, like treating it like a restaurant?"
09:34;09:40;"I mean, if I lived in the area, like I could see you like walking over there and getting that breakfast sandwich."
09:40;09:47;"And I feel like the word is out on that because I talked to some other couples that had had babies at Huntington and they were like, food's not bad."
09:47;09:50;"So we had that working for us."
09:50;10:01;"Well, especially now. Now it's going to get the TC bump. Just people kind of some food shows. Stanley Tucci rolling up to Pasadena."
10:01;10:06;"Is the Huntington Hospital cafeteria on Uber Eats by chance?"
10:06;10:09;"It's not a bad idea."
10:09;10:11;"I'm currently looking at the menu."
10:11;10:12;"Oh, nice."
10:12;10:16;"Did you get any of their sort of main entree dinners?"
10:16;10:18;"Remind me what was there again?"
10:18;10:22;"Well, they have a spaghetti. They have a pesto, a marinade, a meat sauce, a rigatoni."
10:22;10:27;"I got the pesto with like penne, a rigatoni or something. Pretty good."
10:27;10:30;"Yeah. Roast turkey and gravy."
10:30;10:32;"Didn't do that."
10:32;10:35;"I did get the chicken pot pie, which was very disappointing."
10:35;10:37;"Damn."
10:37;10:43;"This feels like the next TC bootleg merch, like the Huntington Hospital restaurant."
10:43;10:47;"Chicken pot pie at the Huntington Hospital."
10:47;10:50;"Very disappointing."
10:50;10:56;"So because you were confined to the room, you couldn't even do like a classic vending machine run?"
10:56;10:59;"I bet I could have if I was super stealth about it."
10:59;11:01;"Go grab a quick baby Ruth."
11:01;11:04;"Yeah, Snickers. Load up on some Snickers."
11:04;11:08;"So it was easy enough to order food, so like it never got dire?"
11:08;11:11;"Just being in one room for that long or two rooms, it sounds so wild."
11:11;11:15;"The first day was like, what is happening? And then you just get into like the rhythm."
11:15;11:17;"What about coffee?"
11:17;11:22;"Terrible, inedible. What I did was I'd order a cup of coffee and then I'd order a hot chocolate."
11:22;11:24;"And then I would just combine them."
11:24;11:25;"Whoa."
11:25;11:31;"It's actually drinkable because this just the coffee on its own was like 1972 like diner coffee."
11:31;11:34;"It's actually Starbucks coffee."
11:34;11:36;"At Huntington Hospital?"
11:36;11:39;"You know what? That didn't surprise me because as we've discussed in the program before,"
11:39;11:43;"just the black Starbucks coffee, just like the daily brew, inedible."
11:43;11:47;"It's funny, Jake, because that was a big topic of conversation with Robert Rosenberg,"
11:47;11:52;"how in the era when Dunkin Donuts started to take off,"
11:52;11:58;"he confirmed to us that the average adult had never had a decent cup of coffee in their life."
11:58;12:02;"Everybody was just drinking this brown sludge instant coffee."
12:02;12:06;"He said the only place you could get a decent cup of coffee in most cities"
12:06;12:11;"was like an after-dinner special blend cup at a fancy hotel."
12:11;12:12;"Oh, wow."
12:12;12:17;"So this coffee that you're describing, it is worth pouring some out for the people from generations past"
12:17;12:21;"who probably drank nothing but that for their entire life."
12:21;12:28;"Were you just hitting a hot chocolate coffee blend like 7 a.m. most days at the hospital?"
12:28;12:29;"Every day."
12:29;12:30;"Wow."
12:30;12:35;"I knew I could tell the coffee would be terrible, so I preemptively made that move day one."
12:35;12:38;"I was like, ""Let's get a coffee and a hot chocolate."""
12:38;12:42;"I feel like that was really like maybe the move that really preserved my sanity the most."
12:42;12:43;"Interesting."
12:43;12:48;"I mean, hot chocolate is a classic nice treat that people forget about"
12:48;12:55;"until one day it's like you're snowed in or it's like freezing or somebody offers it to you"
12:55;12:59;"or you had too much coffee and you're walking around in a cold place and it's the afternoon"
12:59;13:01;"and then suddenly you remember like hot chocolate."
13:01;13:05;"Very special treat, so it's nice that you had an opportunity to hit that."
13:05;13:08;"[Laughter]"
13:08;13:10;"They should add that to the menu."
13:10;13:11;"The Jake."
13:11;13:13;"Oh, the Jake. Yeah."
13:13;13:16;"Actually, it should be the Jake Longstreth because it's like an Arnold Palmer"
13:16;13:22;"except it's half dog s*** hospital coffee and half hot chocolate."
13:22;13:25;"That is the Jake Longstreth."
13:25;13:26;"The Jake Longstreth."
14:13;14:15;"This is unusual."
14:15;14:23;"Matt just sent me a Yelp review, a five-star Yelp review of the bistro at Huntington Hospital."
14:23;14:25;"It's just an interesting review."
14:25;14:26;"Oh, cool."
14:26;14:28;"Gosh, the food is great, but only on weekdays."
14:28;14:31;"I've been there on the weekend and I've been so disappointed,"
14:31;14:35;"but I still have to give credit to the staff for a wonderful job on that delicious food."
14:35;14:38;"I keep going back for more."
14:38;14:39;"Whoa."
14:39;14:41;"I keep going back for more."
14:41;14:45;"There's just a neighborhood person that goes to the cafeteria, just walks in."
14:45;14:46;"At the hospital."
14:46;14:50;"I mean, yeah, during normal times, people can just roll into a hospital."
14:50;14:52;"They're not like stopping you at the door."
14:52;14:58;"That's funny though because like Huntington Hospital is located in like pretty centrally in Pasadena."
14:58;15:03;"Like there's a Vons literally across the street and there's like a chicken shawarma place."
15:03;15:09;"There's like a bunch of like restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance of the hospital."
15:09;15:13;"So, it's funny to think about someone just being like, I'm in that hospital."
15:13;15:15;"I love that ambiance."
15:15;15:18;"Well, you never even got to experience what the bistro is actually like."
15:18;15:20;"Maybe it is just a good vibe."
15:20;15:21;"No, it could be."
15:21;15:22;"Yeah."
15:22;15:24;"I mean, the hospital itself is pretty beautiful."
15:24;15:27;"Like the exterior and like the entryway, it feels like a hotel."
15:27;15:29;"I mean, like the rooms don't."
15:29;15:30;"It's like a nice old hospital."
15:30;15:33;"Yeah, like once you're in the hospital like itself, it feels like a hospital."
15:33;15:36;"But the actual like entryway is like very stately."
15:36;15:37;"Interesting."
15:37;15:38;"Surprising."
15:38;15:39;"I'd never been before."
15:39;15:40;"So."
15:40;15:44;"Pasadena is such a major location for you in your life, Jake."
15:44;15:49;"From Dead Knight and the Dina at the Old Town Pub to Uncle Ted."
15:49;15:55;"Uncle Ted watching Van Halen play early days on somebody's tennis court."
15:55;15:56;"Birth of your child."
15:56;15:58;"It's the birth of my mom too."
15:58;15:59;"That's wild."
15:59;16:00;"Wow."
16:00;16:01;"Oh, yeah."
16:01;16:05;"I may have said this before on the show, but one of my earliest restaurant memories is"
16:05;16:13;"that the hospital where my sister was born when I was four years old had a McDonald's."
16:13;16:14;"So."
16:14;16:15;"Oh, man."
16:15;16:20;"I remember very little about like the specifics of her birth other than that on the ground"
16:20;16:22;"floor there was a McDonald's at the hospital."
16:22;16:28;"And just kind of like, I mean, I imagine I probably was like a little bit confused about"
16:28;16:30;"going to the hospital a few times."
16:30;16:33;"Like I probably didn't at four probably didn't fully understand what was happening."
16:33;16:36;"But I'm sure everybody was like, it's tight."
16:36;16:37;"There's a McDonald's there."
16:37;16:44;"I imagine that there are far fewer McDonald's in hospitals over the past 20, 30 years."
16:44;16:46;"I think that's a good guess."
16:46;16:47;"You know, it's funny."
16:47;16:48;"There's actually a good transition."
16:48;16:51;"I bet a lot of them were replaced by Subways."
16:51;16:55;"Like you can totally picture just like."
16:55;16:56;"Yeah."
16:56;16:58;"Subway franchisees being like, you know what?"
16:58;17:00;"Subway is the fastest growing chain in the world."
17:00;17:01;"It's healthy."
17:01;17:07;"McDonald's is dominated in a lot of spaces and like go talk to like the president of"
17:07;17:12;"a hospital or the, you know, board of executives and being like, guys, it's 2003."
17:12;17:18;"Are you really still having a McDonald's in a place where you're healing people?"
17:18;17:19;"You need a Subway."
17:19;17:22;"People need to eat fresh in a hospital."
17:22;17:23;"McDonald's is a bad vibe."
17:23;17:26;"I bet there's way more Subways now."
17:26;17:27;"I'm sure you're right."
17:27;17:32;"I mean, it's fascinating to me that your four year old brain picked up on the McDonald's"
17:32;17:35;"being in this in the hospital."
17:35;17:37;"Well, I'm sure that's all I was thinking about."
17:37;17:40;"I think that there's legislation against it."
17:40;17:41;"Right."
17:41;17:47;"So there are 15 states that allow fast food in hospitals."
17:47;17:53;"Florida and Texas earn the dishonorable mention, according to this HuffPost article I'm reading,"
17:53;17:57;"for being the states with the most fast food locations inside of hospitals."
17:57;17:59;"People always beating up on Florida and Texas."
17:59;18:01;"They can't catch a break."
18:01;18:03;"Come on."
18:03;18:04;"But it depends what it is."
18:04;18:07;"I mean, like, are they including like Chipotle?"
18:07;18:10;"A lot of people would be psyched if there's a Chipotle at the hospital."
18:10;18:11;"A Jamba Juice?"
18:11;18:13;"Yeah, Jamba Juice."
18:13;18:14;"Very healthy."
18:14;18:20;"I mean, is Chipotle going to be much more unhealthy than like just random cafeteria fare?"
18:20;18:21;"Probably not."
18:21;18:22;"You know, it'd be pretty tight."
18:22;18:23;"I always think of this."
18:23;18:26;"I'm sure I've talked about it before, but I remember hitting the--"
18:26;18:28;"I think with you, Jake, on the early Dirty Projector story,"
18:28;18:37;"I remember hitting an IHOP in El Paso for breakfast as we made our way, you know,"
18:37;18:39;"to New Mexico or whatever."
18:39;18:42;"An IHOP would actually be pretty tight to have in a hospital."
18:42;18:48;"A bleary-eyed hospital morning, got no sleep, go down to the lobby,"
18:48;18:53;"get up in an IHOP, get some eggs, bacon, some nice pancakes."
18:53;18:56;"That'd be like a really kind vibe energy at a hospital."
18:56;18:57;"That would rule."
18:57;19:02;"I don't know if ""kind vibe"" is the word I'm looking for, but yeah."
19:05;19:08;"It doesn't really matter 'cause there ain't no one around."
19:08;19:11;"Tiptoe through the alley and tiptoe through your life."
19:11;19:15;"You still gotta come and be a gun, be a knife."
19:15;19:20;"Next thing you know, you're eating hospital food."
19:38;19:41;"Karaoke castration to the most polite."
19:41;19:45;"He's gonna sting you anyway, tiptoe through the hive."
19:45;19:48;"Yesterday was sucking and tomorrow's looking bad."
19:48;19:51;"And today was the only thing I had."
19:51;19:53;"Well, should we talk about ""Subway""?"
19:53;19:56;"Oh, wait, Jake, as we transition into the ""Subway"" segment,"
19:56;20:00;"and I can't wait to hear everything you've learned from reading the ""Subway"" book,"
20:00;20:04;"it makes me wonder, all these hours in the hospital waiting,"
20:04;20:08;"and, you know, I'm sure Hannah probably had to rest a lot."
20:08;20:12;"Are you just, like, scrolling your phone the whole time?"
20:12;20:14;"Are you, like, taking down some big books?"
20:14;20:16;"Are you rereading the ""Subway"" book?"
20:16;20:18;"I did not bring the ""Subway"" book."
20:18;20:23;"I did bring a book that Nick recommended that I read most of,"
20:23;20:27;"""The Big Goodbye"" is the name of it, right, Nick? Isn't that what it's called?"
20:27;20:30;"Yeah, ""The Making of Chinatown,"" the movie."
20:30;20:37;"I thought I recommended ""To the Thread"" as a TC Book Club companion to ""Chaos,"""
20:37;20:41;"'cause I felt they sort of had a bit of a--"
20:41;20:43;"Oh, yeah, I want to check that out."
20:43;20:47;"- No, it's a good book. - '70s film vibes."
20:47;20:49;"Yeah, it's just about the making of that movie,"
20:49;20:52;"and the Polanski, Robert Evans, Robert Towne,"
20:52;20:57;"who's the other character, I'm forgetting, but, yeah, it's a cool book."
20:57;20:59;"I took down most of that when I was there."
20:59;21:02;"- Obviously looking at the phone, too. - Right."
21:02;21:04;"I've just started a new book now that I'm a new dad."
21:04;21:07;"- What's that? - ""World War Z."""
21:07;21:09;"Oh, like the movie that they made a movie of?"
21:09;21:12;"Yeah, I loved the movie, and then I was reading--"
21:12;21:14;"I saw some blurb about the book recently,"
21:14;21:20;"and the blurb made the book sound like it was this highly detailed"
21:20;21:24;"oral history of this zombie pandemic."
21:24;21:27;"It goes into insane logistics of the economics, the politics,"
21:27;21:29;"- obviously the military. - Whoa."
21:29;21:32;"And just insane survivalist stuff"
21:32;21:37;"told by dozens of different people from around the world."
21:37;21:40;"- I've read the first 50 pages today, loving it. - It's gripping."
21:40;21:43;"I don't really ever read sci-fi stuff."
21:43;21:46;"This is maybe the first sci-fi book I've ever read."
21:46;21:50;"This also sounds like something we might have talked about on TC before,"
21:50;21:54;"but I've always been interested in the difference between hard and soft sci-fi."
21:54;21:57;"You know, soft sci-fi can be kind of just like,"
21:57;22:02;"vibey takes place in the future, but it's still about emotions and relationships."
22:02;22:06;"And hard sci-fi, as I understand it,"
22:06;22:09;"has a high degree of technical detail,"
22:09;22:13;"where people-- there's a lot of readers who don't want to just be like,"
22:13;22:15;"""Then he said goodbye and jumped on the hover jet."""
22:15;22:18;"They want to know how stuff works,"
22:18;22:20;"and some of which I imagine is logistical."
22:20;22:22;"That's like, ""How do the flying cars work?"""
22:22;22:25;"And it's like, ""Well, they found a very specific mineral"
22:25;22:28;"in a mining colony in a distant solar system."""
22:28;22:31;"But I can also imagine kind of a middle ground."
22:31;22:33;"We should make a compilation of this,"
22:33;22:35;"where it's kind of like in that movie Ad Astra,"
22:35;22:38;"how there's an Applebee's on the moon that we talked about."
22:38;22:42;"It's not hard in terms of being technical,"
22:42;22:44;"but it's also not fully soft."
22:44;22:49;"It's just very detailed in terms of business logistics and bureaucracy."
22:49;22:53;"I think World War Z almost feels like hard poly-sci-fi."
22:53;22:57;"Because it's more about how different countries react."
22:57;22:58;"I like poly-sci-fi."
22:58;23:01;"It's poly-sci-fi. Pretty hard, too."
23:01;23:04;"Okay, so maybe we need to pioneer corporate food sci-fi."
23:04;23:09;"That's just like, ""Aliens come,"" or ""It takes place 200 years in the future."""
23:09;23:11;"And it's just like a very..."
23:11;23:13;"That'd actually be a tight novel."
23:13;23:16;"Just like Dunkin' Donuts 2150."
23:16;23:20;"And it's just like an insanely dense, detailed story"
23:20;23:24;"of how Dunkin' Donuts survived to the year 2150,"
23:24;23:27;"and how things work in that era."
23:27;23:28;"I wonder if it will."
23:28;23:32;"Did you guys read Jurassic Park, the original Michael Crichton novel?"
23:32;23:33;"Didn't read it, no."
23:33;23:38;"Well, he definitely would infuse his works with multiple pages of the science."
23:38;23:42;"I remember being a kid and just being like, ""Yo, where's the story?"""
23:42;23:46;"This is a lot of DNA, molecular sh*t."
23:46;23:49;"And then I remember reading, ""Oh, it's not even that accurate."""
23:49;23:51;"But I was 12 or something."
23:51;23:53;"Just very descriptive."
23:53;23:58;"Just like, ""As the nucleotides fuse together in the mRNA."""
23:58;24:01;"It was exactly like that for multiple pages."
24:01;24:03;"And then Disclosure, which was made--"
24:03;24:06;"The reverse-- The Demi Moore--"
24:06;24:07;"Do you remember that movie?"
24:07;24:08;"Vaguely."
24:08;24:13;"He got into all sorts of business, org, tech stuff as well."
24:13;24:17;"Anyway, he would have been great to write the Dunkin' Donuts thing,"
24:17;24:19;"but he's no longer with us."
24:19;24:23;"Dunkin' 2150, definitely located in a hospital."
24:23;24:25;"I feel like we have to go--"
24:25;24:27;"Some of us or all of us have to go try out that avocado toast."
24:27;24:28;"Is that out?"
24:28;24:29;"Yes, it's out now."
24:29;24:30;"I haven't tried it yet."
24:30;24:33;"Okay, well, let's circle back."
25:11;25:17;"Should we do the subway stuff?"
25:17;25:19;"Yeah, let's get in the subway."
25:19;25:22;"I was inspired by Ezra after he picked up the Robert Rosenberg book."
25:22;25:29;"I looked online and I found Start Small, Finish Big by Fred DeLuca,"
25:29;25:31;"who was the co-founder of Subway."
25:31;25:33;"And it's similar to the Robert Rosenberg book,"
25:33;25:39;"I think in the sense that the bulk of it is like advice for would-be entrepreneurs."
25:39;25:43;"But there is a very detailed chapter in here called My Story."
25:43;25:48;"And I thought I would just do sort of more of like a reading series from Fred DeLuca's book."
25:48;25:49;"Love it."
25:49;25:53;"The chapter is actually called So I Hear You Make Sandwiches."
25:53;25:56;"This story could have happened to almost anyone, anywhere."
25:56;26:02;"Carmela Hombres and Salvatore DeLuca just so happened to live in Brooklyn in the 1940s."
26:02;26:05;"One day they met and not long after, they were married."
26:05;26:08;"In 1947, they had a son, and that was me."
26:08;26:12;"For the first several years of my life, we lived in the basement apartment of a two-family house."
26:12;26:17;"It was a humble, low-rent apartment, something that newlyweds could afford."
26:17;26:22;"When I was five, we moved to the Bronx to a new development, which everyone called the Projects."
26:22;26:27;"It was public housing, one of the many similar developments built after World War II."
26:27;26:30;"For the DeLuca family, it was a setup."
26:30;26:36;"When I was 10, my dad's employer, Empire Devices, moved his manufacturing facility to Bridgeport, Connecticut."
26:36;26:41;"And that's where we met Pete Buck and his wife, Heidi, who soon became close friends."
26:41;26:48;"One Sunday in July 1965, we were invited to visit the Bucks' home and enjoy a family barbecue."
26:48;26:53;"That was the day Pete and I formed a business relationship that would eventually make a huge impact in the fast food industry."
26:53;26:59;"I had just graduated from high school, and my only real concern was to figure out how to pay for college."
26:59;27:05;"But in the summer of 1965, there wasn't much hope that I could get through college, because my family simply didn't have the money."
27:05;27:11;"I worked at a local hardware store as a stock clerk, earning $1.25, the minimum wage."
27:11;27:15;"The more I thought about college, the more I wondered about how I could find the money."
27:15;27:19;"As we pulled into Pete's driveway, it occurred to me I might ask Pete for some advice."
27:19;27:25;"The Bucks lived in a large white house, built on three quarters of an acre, which seemed to me like a sprawling property."
27:25;27:30;"I was really impressed when I saw the two-car garage with two cars parked inside."
27:30;27:34;"Pete must have landed himself a great job, one that paid a lot of money, I thought to myself."
27:34;27:39;"It was late afternoon when I saw the opportunity to talk privately with Pete in the backyard."
27:39;27:47;"As Pete and I stood in the middle of his green lawn, I said, ""Pete, I want to go to college at the University of Bridgeport, but I don't have the money."
27:47;27:52;"And I was wondering if you had any ideas how I might get the money to pay my way through school."""
27:52;27:58;"Pete looked at me, and without hesitation, he said, ""I think you should open a submarine sandwich shop."""
27:58;28:00;"What?"
28:00;28:03;"Of all the possible answers, this was not what I expected."
28:03;28:11;"What an odd thing to say to a 17-year-old kid, especially one who came from a modest home where no one ever owned any businesses."
28:11;28:15;"Pete explained the submarine sandwich business very simply."
28:15;28:22;"He said that all you had to do was rent a small store, build a counter, buy some food, and open it for business."
28:22;28:26;"Customers would then come into the restaurant and put their money on the counter."
28:26;28:33;"To Pete, it was just as simple as that, although Pete had never owned a business nor run a sandwich shop himself."
28:33;28:36;"Thinking now about our conversation, it's almost unbelievable."
28:36;28:44;"We were just two guys on a Sunday afternoon barbecue speculating, really, about something we knew very little to nothing about."
28:44;28:47;"Which is very in keeping with the TC theme."
28:47;28:54;"Guys hanging out on a Sunday, speculating about things they know nothing about."
28:54;29:06;"Pete goes on to tell Fred about a small chain of sandwich shops in upstate New York called Mike's Submarine Sandwiches,"
29:06;29:09;"which had opened 32 restaurants in 10 years."
29:09;29:13;"At that point, Peter Buck, also a great name..."
29:13;29:16;"Wait, is that the same as the R.E.M. guitarist?"
29:16;29:17;"Yeah, exactly."
29:17;29:24;"Peter Buck and Fred DeLuca formed a business relationship that day in the summer of '65,"
29:24;29:29;"where their plan from the outset was to open 32 restaurants in 10 years."
29:29;29:35;"And then the book goes into enormous detail about opening the first few restaurants, and it was definitely a struggle."
29:35;29:37;"What you just read is unbelievable."
29:37;29:44;"It's like, either he's leaving out part of the story because he doesn't want other entrepreneurs to know,"
29:44;29:51;"or I guess what maybe is more likely is just, that truly is how crazy the world is."
29:51;29:57;"Like, every once in a while, somebody has a weird idea."
29:57;30:00;"It's not even an original idea."
30:00;30:05;"Also, the fact that it's a dude asking for advice on how to pay for college,"
30:05;30:08;"it's such a weird answer to the question, where he's like,"
30:08;30:13;"""You know, I was recently in upstate New York where I saw a chain of 32 submarine sandwich shops."
30:13;30:17;"I think you should open a chain of 32 submarine sandwich shops."""
30:17;30:25;"Does he explain elsewhere what Pete saw in this chain that made him feel like it was a great business opportunity?"
30:25;30:28;"Well, I think it was, ""If this guy can do it, we can do it."""
30:28;30:30;"Wait, hold on, I have..."
30:30;30:34;"There's literally nothing to learn from his story."
30:34;30:37;"Oh, absolutely not."
30:37;30:40;"When Pete finished reading the article, he looked up at us and wondered,"
30:40;30:45;"""If Mike Davis can do this..."" Mike Davis is the guy that owned Mike's Submarine Sandwiches."
30:45;30:47;"There was an article in the paper about him."
30:47;30:52;"He started with almost nothing to create a mini empire in upstate New York of subway sandwich shops."
30:52;30:54;"When Pete finished reading the article, he looked up at us and wondered,"
30:54;30:57;"""If Michael Davis can do this, why can't we?"""
30:57;31:00;"I now know that the question didn't come out by accident."
31:00;31:04;"Pete wanted to set a long-term goal beyond the opening of one store."
31:04;31:08;"When no one could think of a reason why we couldn't perform as well as Michael Davis,"
31:08;31:11;"we began discussing what we could accomplish."
31:11;31:17;"That's how we set a goal to build 32 restaurants in 10 years, which they did not meet."
31:17;31:18;"Oh, really?"
31:18;31:21;"They were at like 28 or something by 1975."
31:21;31:25;"You never went to college? You just went full-time into the business?"
31:25;31:27;"Yeah, exactly."
31:27;31:28;"So, I could read a little more."
31:28;31:29;"Please."
31:29;31:30;"Later years."
31:30;31:34;"As we celebrated Subway's 10th anniversary in 1975,"
31:34;31:37;"the fact that we were several restaurants shy of our goal wasn't much of a disappointment."
31:37;31:41;"We knew it was only a matter of time until we would surpass that goal and set a new one."
31:41;31:47;"We opened our 32nd restaurant in 1976, and in two years we opened our 100th restaurant."
31:47;31:51;"And by '82, we had doubled our network to 200 restaurants."
31:51;31:56;"The rapid growth created numerous challenges that required the resolve of our talented home and office team."
31:56;31:58;"So now, what do we do?"
31:58;31:59;"How were we doing?"
31:59;32:01;"Was 200 restaurants a lot or a little?"
32:01;32:03;"What else was possible?"
32:03;32:05;"If we set another goal, what would it be?"
32:05;32:09;"After conducting a market study of the fast food industry in 1982,"
32:09;32:13;"sizing up other chains and their growth, and considering Subway's growth,"
32:13;32:18;"I decided our new goal would be 5,000 restaurants by 1994."
32:18;32:20;"It was an aggressive goal."
32:20;32:23;"Most of our employees were stunned when I announced it,"
32:23;32:25;"and some of them thought I was absolutely crazy."
32:25;32:29;"We have only 200 restaurants. How are we going to open 4,800 more?"
32:29;32:34;"From the perspective of many of our team members, it seemed impossible to grow Subway 25-fold."
32:34;32:38;"But from my perspective, it looked like an extremely challenging objective."
32:38;32:42;"But not much more challenging than opening 32 restaurants in 10 years."
32:42;32:44;"Which I don't understand at all."
33:01;33:04;"Obviously, these guys sound like they knew nothing"
33:04;33:07;"other than they somewhat looked down on Mike Davis."
33:07;33:10;"If this f***ing Mike Davis character can do it, why can't we?"
33:10;33:11;"We can do it."
33:11;33:12;"They have no original idea."
33:12;33:17;"And also, they just arbitrarily look at what Mike Davis accomplished, 32 restaurants,"
33:17;33:20;"and they just say, ""F*** it, we'll do 32 restaurants in 10 years."""
33:20;33:24;"It seems so arbitrary, and yet, based on what you just read,"
33:24;33:27;"32 was somehow the magic number."
33:27;33:31;"When they finally got to 32, then the curve went crazy."
33:31;33:34;"So I guess, if anybody, that is a big lesson for entrepreneurs,"
33:34;33:38;"is that the first 32 sub shops are the hardest."
33:38;33:42;"And the second you get to 33, then you're printing money."
33:42;33:44;"It's off to the races."
33:44;33:47;"33 to 5,000 is actually pretty easy."
33:47;33:50;"Zero to 32, that's the danger zone."
33:50;33:53;"Because after that, they blow through all their goals."
33:53;33:55;"They meet all their goals years early."
33:55;33:57;"When we passed our 8,000th store mark,"
33:57;34:00;"we decided it was time to publish a different type of goal."
34:00;34:03;"Now, rather than measuring how many restaurants we opened,"
34:03;34:08;"we decided to concentrate on cents per capita in North America."
34:08;34:14;"Our goal was for every man, woman, and child to spend 50 cents per week at Subway by 2005."
34:14;34:15;"Which..."
34:15;34:16;"Every..."
34:16;34:20;"They wanted every human in America to spend 50 cents?"
34:20;34:26;"They wanted every person to spend $26.50 annually at Subway."
34:26;34:31;"Do you think you've spent $26.50 annually at Subway in your life, on average?"
34:31;34:34;"No. I haven't been to Subway in 15 years."
34:34;34:35;"I could imagine a couple..."
34:35;34:36;"There was a period."
34:36;34:37;"Yeah, me too."
34:37;34:38;"There was a period."
34:38;34:39;"There was a period I might have hit that."
34:39;34:40;"Like early tours."
34:40;34:44;"Like, we're hitting a truck stop in Twin Falls, Idaho."
34:44;34:45;"Right."
34:45;34:47;"I'm going to get the Veggie Delight footlong."
34:47;34:48;"Yeah, classic."
34:48;34:53;"From like the gas station, Flying J, Subway, you know."
34:53;34:57;"I probably spent like between $15 and $100 those years."
34:57;34:59;"Regular chips or baked?"
34:59;35:02;"Sun chips, yeah. The sun chips."
35:02;35:04;"Oh, God. That's such a sh*tty meal."
35:04;35:05;"I got like..."
35:05;35:06;"Yeah."
35:06;35:10;"I like elements of Subway sandwiches, but at least at McDonald's,"
35:10;35:14;"the burger, the fries, and the Coke, it's like a balanced meal."
35:14;35:16;"It works together."
35:16;35:18;"It makes sense to me."
35:18;35:22;"There's something about just like being at Subway."
35:22;35:23;"I feel... Also, wait."
35:23;35:24;"Am I tripping?"
35:24;35:26;"Does Subway have fountain soda?"
35:26;35:28;"Or do you usually get it from the cooler?"
35:28;35:30;"Old school definitely had fountain soda."
35:30;35:33;"Like I said, I haven't been in the Subway in many years."
35:33;35:35;"So I could see them."
35:35;35:37;"Because I feel like a lot of Subways are small now,"
35:37;35:38;"where it's kind of mostly carry out."
35:38;35:40;"But like the old school like..."
35:40;35:41;"Yeah, some of them must have."
35:41;35:45;"But anyway, just when I picture like a Subway meal,"
35:45;35:49;"where it's like the sandwich, a bag of chips,"
35:49;35:53;"and like, you know, a Coke in a plastic bottle or something."
35:53;35:54;"There's just no balance there."
35:54;35:56;"That's like a terrible..."
35:56;35:57;"I mean, of course, what are they going to..."
35:57;36:00;"They're not going to start having like side salads or something."
36:00;36:02;"But there's just something about like..."
36:02;36:04;"I always kind of felt like keep the chips."
36:04;36:05;"I've always hated that."
36:05;36:07;"I've always just hated sandwich and a bag of chips."
36:07;36:11;"That's also a classic like institutional lunch."
36:11;36:13;"I mean, I was doing the bag of chips at Huntington Hospital."
36:13;36:14;"Let me tell you."
36:14;36:16;"Oh, were they bringing a bag of chips with all your sandwiches?"
36:16;36:18;"What sort of chips? Doritos?"
36:18;36:20;"No, just a Lay's. No."
36:20;36:21;"It's a classic regular?"
36:21;36:23;"It's like turkey sandwich with a bag of Lay's."
36:23;36:24;"Just the yellow Lay's?"
36:24;36:26;"Yellow Lay's, straight up."
36:26;36:29;"Subway water is Dasani."
36:29;36:31;"Of course. Disgraceful."
36:31;36:35;"A plastic bottle of Dasani, a Subway turkey sub,"
36:35;36:38;"and just a bag of plain Lay's."
36:38;36:39;"Jesus Christ."
36:39;36:42;"$7.89."
36:42;36:45;"I feel like roasted tomato sun chips."
36:45;36:48;"Oh, man."
36:48;36:51;"Don't forget the cookies that taste like the bread"
36:51;36:54;"because they absorb the bread fumes."
36:54;36:55;"That was always a treat."
36:55;36:57;"Oh, yeah. The cookie."
36:57;36:58;"That's even crazier."
36:58;36:59;"What's that?"
36:59;37:01;"Sandwich chips and a cookie."
37:01;37:03;"Oh."
37:03;37:04;"I've always felt this way."
37:04;37:08;"Even back in the '90s, the phrase, ""All that and a bag of chips."""
37:08;37:10;"I was always just kind of like, ""Ugh."""
37:10;37:13;"Sir, if you get the drink and the chips, it's actually less money"
37:13;37:15;"than just ordering the sandwich out of the cart."
37:15;37:16;"It's fine."
37:16;37:18;"It's fine."
37:18;37:20;"Keep your sun chips."
37:20;37:24;"Sun chips and Dasani are two of the biggest scams out there."
37:24;37:27;"The sandwich is kind of like the purest part of what's happening,"
37:27;37:29;"but yeah, Dasani is brutal."
37:29;37:32;"Sun chips, just like--"
37:32;37:35;"Because sun chips are so sad because they don't taste bad,"
37:35;37:39;"but it's like this vague gesture towards nature or something healthy."
37:39;37:41;"But so like, ugh."
37:41;37:42;"Nature."
37:42;37:43;"That's funny."
37:43;37:47;"It's like if you're going to do chips, just go nacho cheese Doritos."
37:47;37:49;"Absolutely."
37:49;37:52;"Stop jerking me around."
37:52;37:54;"The last thing I will say from this book,"
37:54;37:59;"and this kind of circles back to your economic sci-fi fantasy"
37:59;38:02;"about Dunkin' 2150."
38:02;38:06;"He feels very confident that by the year 2050,"
38:06;38:09;"a large fast food company will be able to operate"
38:09;38:11;"more than 100,000 outlets."
38:11;38:12;"Whoa."
38:12;38:14;"Well, how many are there right now?"
38:14;38:17;"Well, I think Subway, there's like 40,000 something."
38:17;38:21;"I feel like Subway is the most prolific of the chains."
38:21;38:25;"Yeah, it's 41,600 Subway locations worldwide,"
38:25;38:28;"down from 42,431 in 2019."
38:28;38:30;"They've cut back a little bit."
38:30;38:32;"I was going to say, I think they're leveling off."
38:32;38:34;"Right, well, you know, COVID years, tough."
38:34;38:37;"I'm very skeptical of that 100,000 outlets,"
38:37;38:40;"although 2050 is quite a long ways off."
38:40;38:43;"It would make sense if they keep growing at the current rate."
38:43;38:46;"But I think the curve is leveling."
38:46;38:48;"Yeah, you'd have to imagine."
38:48;38:51;"Are there a lot of Subways in China?"
38:51;38:55;"Because we know that that accounts for so much of Starbucks growth."
38:55;38:56;"Yeah, there's got to be."
38:56;38:58;"It seems like that's how it always is for these corporations."
38:58;39:02;"It's always about new markets."
39:02;39:05;"The US is a mature sub market."
39:05;39:09;"They've kind of probably reached more or less full saturation."
39:09;39:10;"Although, who knows?"
39:10;39:12;"Maybe over saturation."
39:12;39:16;"Yeah, I guess what they might be hoping for is also their rivals to fall"
39:16;39:21;"because a big part of Dunkin's growth and part of the cathartic ending"
39:21;39:25;"of the donut wars for the Rosenberg and Winokur families"
39:25;39:30;"was when Dunkin Donuts ended up purchasing all the rest"
39:30;39:34;"of the North American Mr. Donuts and then turning them into Dunkin's."
39:34;39:38;"So maybe that could be an end phase for Subway."
39:38;39:41;"I don't know how Quiznos is doing these days."
39:41;39:44;"Jersey Mike's seems to be thriving, actually."
39:44;39:49;"But maybe one day, if their finances get messy,"
39:49;39:52;"Subway could buy up all the Jersey Mike's, convert them,"
39:52;39:54;"and that might put them over the top."
39:54;39:57;"That could be another few thousand or something,"
39:57;39:59;"plus new and emerging sub markets."
39:59;40:03;"I'm on Quora, the question and answer website."
40:03;40:08;"There's an anecdote from two years ago from a civil engineer in China"
40:08;40:12;"who said, ""About five years ago, Subway opened three restaurants"
40:12;40:13;"in my city in China."
40:13;40:16;"My city is a third-tier city, by some reckoning,"
40:16;40:18;"perhaps a fourth-tier city."""
40:18;40:20;"Anyway, I won't bore you with the details,"
40:20;40:24;"but it seems like, from this person's perspective,"
40:24;40:32;"the Chinese interpretation of how a Subway sandwich is received in China"
40:32;40:35;"is that it's regarded as actually a hamburger."
40:35;40:40;"Sandwiches are most commonly recognized as a triangular shape,"
40:40;40:46;"sort of like your classic, what your mom might prepare for you at lunch."
40:46;40:47;"A slice of bread."
40:47;40:48;"A slice of bread, right."
40:48;40:53;"The hoagie is interpreted more as a burger,"
40:53;40:56;"and burgers are associated with unhealthy eating."
40:56;41:00;"So there's like--and again, this is one person's testimony,"
41:00;41:02;"but it seems like it's sort of--"
41:02;41:03;"So they weren't thriving."
41:03;41:07;"Yeah, it seems like, just anecdotally, kind of missing the mark"
41:07;41:09;"as far as what Subway is known for."
41:09;41:11;"Right, well, especially when you consider that"
41:11;41:15;"a big part of Subway's explosive growth was the decline of McDonald's,"
41:15;41:18;"and Subway making this big push to be like,"
41:18;41:21;"""We're a healthy fast food. You're stuffing your face with burgers."""
41:21;41:24;"And maybe it's not a failure of marketing."
41:24;41:27;"Maybe just the people in this third or fourth tier city in China,"
41:27;41:31;"they're not beholden to our bizarre cultural norms,"
41:31;41:33;"and they can see right through this bullsh*t."
41:33;41:37;"And they're just like, ""You're trying to present this as eating fresh?"
41:37;41:41;"This is just another disgusting American chain."
41:41;41:43;"This is no different than McDonald's, and we're not falling for it."""
41:43;41:48;"I found this article from Reuters in 2010 that says,"
41:48;41:51;"""Subway eyes""--this is about 11 years ago--"
41:51;41:55;"""Subway eyes matching McDonald's in China in 10 years."""
41:55;41:57;"And they're really like, ""We're going for it."""
41:57;41:59;"And they missed the mark."
41:59;42:03;"What I think is interesting is how competitive they seem."
42:03;42:07;"It's very like Michael Jordan, ""Last Dance."""
42:07;42:10;"They're like, ""We don't like Jersey Mike's."
42:10;42:13;"We're going after Jersey Mike's. We're going to go after their numbers."""
42:13;42:15;"But yeah, clearly they miss it."
42:15;42:17;"But there is something kind of interesting."
42:17;42:19;"It's the opposite of Dunkin'."
42:19;42:21;"It's not cool."
42:21;42:23;"[laughs]"
42:23;42:26;"Yeah, Subway is not cool."
42:26;42:28;"It's not kind at all. It's not cool."
42:28;42:30;"They've had a rough run."
42:30;42:33;"Let's not forget the rise and fall of Jared Fogle."
42:33;42:34;"Of course."
42:34;42:35;"That was rough."
42:35;42:39;"And then recently there was the whole tuna or not tuna snafu,"
42:39;42:41;"which Subway pushed back on very hard."
42:41;42:44;"Well, also, I think I talked about this on TC once."
42:44;42:49;"I read an article that was--this is like a little more in the weeds,"
42:49;42:51;"but still important nonetheless."
42:51;42:55;"There was an investigative article, I think in the New York Times,"
42:55;43:01;"that implied that Subway was kind of like being really sh*tty to their franchisees,"
43:01;43:04;"which is very much not the Dunkin' way, supposedly,"
43:04;43:07;"where they value their franchisees as part of the family."
43:07;43:12;"It basically was like a story of how they could use the blood, sweat, and tears"
43:12;43:15;"of a franchisee who tries to build a Dunkin',"
43:15;43:21;"but then by hitting them, dinging them with arbitrary violations,"
43:21;43:26;"they could then take the restaurant back to the mothership, so to speak."
43:26;43:29;"So, you know, imagine you dedicated your whole life to a Subway,"
43:29;43:31;"you sunk your life savings into it,"
43:31;43:34;"and then they send somebody from corporate a few times a year,"
43:34;43:37;"and they're just like, ""That light bulb was not screwed in properly."
43:37;43:41;"Two more violations, and we'll take your license away."""
43:41;43:43;"That's kind of what the article implied."
43:43;43:46;"But I'm only half remembering it, so don't quote me on it."
43:46;43:48;"Do your own research."

44:36;44:39;"[singing]"
44:39;44:43;"[singing]"
44:47;44:51;"But yeah, it is funny to think, like, Subway..."
44:51;44:53;"Like, I'm not even kidding."
44:53;44:55;"Subway just seems like a technology."
44:55;44:58;"It's so little about, like, the customer experience or the food."
44:58;45:02;"Like, even McDonald's feels more about, like, the food."
45:02;45:04;"Subway really just feels like a technology,"
45:04;45:07;"a viral technology that's spreading across the globe."
45:07;45:10;"There's just some-- It's like the food is so besides the point there."
45:10;45:13;"-Yeah. -I don't picture Fred DeLuca--"
45:13;45:17;"Well, I don't want to get personal, but, you know, like, this idea of--"
45:17;45:20;"We talked-- One thing that Robert Rosenberg said,"
45:20;45:25;"which is kind of shocking, is that he doesn't have very strong taste buds."
45:25;45:28;"-Mm. -So he's always relied on other people in the office"
45:28;45:30;"to, like, really decide if something tastes good"
45:30;45:32;"and if the consumers are going to like it."
45:32;45:34;"There's something about Subway where it just feels like--"
45:34;45:36;"I know they're always-- They have special sandwiches,"
45:36;45:38;"but it just feels like, who gives a f---?"
45:38;45:40;"It's just like, open a Subway."
45:40;45:42;"I feel like Subway gets most of their customers"
45:42;45:44;"just from people being like, ""Well..."""
45:44;45:47;"-""I'm hungry."" -""I'm hungry, and I probably shouldn't go to McDonald's."""

51:32;51:34;"It's like you don't even complain at Subway."
51:34;51:36;"It's food, it's function."
51:36;51:38;"Here's a tough question."
51:38;51:40;"For the show."
51:40;51:42;"If you had to eat at Subway or McDonald's"
51:42;51:44;"every day for the rest of your life,"
51:44;51:45;"you had to choose one."
51:45;51:46;"Which one?"
51:46;51:48;"Let's say lunch every day."
51:48;51:50;"Same meal?"
51:50;51:52;"Or you have diversity in..."
51:52;51:54;"Just lunch."
51:54;51:56;"Just lunch, diversity of the menu."
51:56;51:58;"McDonald's."
51:58;52:00;"And some big up salads at McDonald's."
52:00;52:02;"Yeah, I think actually McDonald's."
52:02;52:03;"It's a broader menu."
52:03;52:05;"I mean, of course there's a part of me"
52:05;52:08;"that still buys into this idea that Subway is healthier."
52:08;52:11;"So I could punish myself with a veggie delight."
52:11;52:16;"Lest I remind the whole crew what I sent in the group text,"
52:16;52:19;"which is they're being sued in Ireland"
52:19;52:22;"because their bread isn't technically bread."
52:22;52:26;"And the tuna, there's a legal battle in the US"
52:26;52:30;"because the tuna isn't technically tuna."
52:30;52:31;"I'm not sure about the tuna story."
52:31;52:32;"I'm not sure I buy that."
52:32;52:35;"But the bread has a ton of sugar in it for sure."
52:35;52:37;"You know, I'm..."
52:37;52:38;"What does that mean that it's not?"
52:38;52:41;"I'm looking at the Subway website now with their menu."
52:41;52:44;"I've got to say, it actually looks pretty good in the pictures."
52:44;52:47;"I might go Subway in that hypothetical."
52:47;52:50;"I mean, of course McDonald's would be more fun."
52:50;52:53;"But, okay, looking at Subway,"
52:53;52:55;"I guess Subway does have salads."
52:55;52:56;"Oh, and they got wraps."
52:56;52:57;"I didn't know they..."
52:57;52:59;"Oh, they got protein bowls now?"
52:59;53:00;"Okay, maybe I got to go back to Subway."
53:00;53:02;"I've been really harsh on it."
53:02;53:03;"Oh, they have a..."
53:03;53:05;"Subway has a breakfast menu."
53:05;53:09;"They have these like funny, like, kind of flatbread things."
53:09;53:10;"Yeah."
53:10;53:11;"Where you could get a bacon, egg and cheese,"
53:11;53:14;"a Black Forest egg and ham, egg and cheese,"
53:14;53:16;"egg and cheese, steak, egg and cheese."
53:16;53:17;"You know what?"
53:17;53:18;"I feel like next episode,"
53:18;53:22;"we all have to get the Dunkin' Donuts avocado toast."
53:22;53:25;"And we all have to get a Subway protein bowl."
53:25;53:26;"Right."
53:26;53:27;"And review them."
53:27;53:30;"Hey, what's the difference between ham and Black Forest ham?"
53:30;53:32;"What makes it Black Forest?"
53:32;53:33;"That's a good question."
53:33;53:38;"I mean, I picture Black Forest ham being dark on the edges."
53:38;53:39;"I guess it, you know,"
53:39;53:41;"comes from the Black Forest region of Germany."
53:41;53:42;"It sounds really cool."
53:42;53:45;"It's a kind of Bavarian preparation of ham."
53:45;53:47;"It's goth ham."
53:47;53:48;"It's not honey ham."
53:48;53:50;"It's not like a pink American ham."
53:50;53:53;"It's like a dark Bavarian ham"
53:53;53:57;"from the deepest, darkest parts of the Black Forest."
53:57;54:01;"I'm picturing that Subway protein bowl being very soggy."
54:01;54:03;"Very soggy?"
54:03;54:06;"The idea that they're just cutting up the meat,"
54:06;54:08;"like chopping up the thin meat"
54:08;54:10;"to make that the part of the protein."
54:10;54:11;"Do you know, it's so thin."
54:11;54:12;"This is gross."
54:12;54:14;"We gotta move on."
54:14;54:18;"It's like approaching slurry levels."
54:18;54:19;"Yeah, we gotta move on."
54:19;54:20;"All right."
54:20;54:21;"No more Subway bowls."
54:21;54:23;"But it's making me think like,"
54:23;54:26;"I wonder if I've ever had a day in my life,"
54:26;54:28;"and I'm sure many people have,"
54:28;54:31;"where it was Dunkin' for breakfast,"
54:31;54:32;"Subway for lunch,"
54:32;54:34;"Mickey D's for dinner."
54:34;54:35;"Oh, damn."
54:35;54:36;"I have not."
54:36;54:38;"You should probably have some fun with that."
54:38;54:39;"That's a good challenge, though."
54:39;54:41;"Maybe that's the TC challenge."
54:41;54:42;"Dunkin' for lunch."
54:42;54:43;"What is this?"
54:43;54:45;"This is a pathetic show."
54:45;54:47;"(laughing)"
54:47;54:48;"The TC challenge."
54:48;54:51;"We're basically just,"
54:51;54:52;"it's where,"
54:52;54:54;"I think sometimes we do hit a place with the show"
54:54;54:55;"where it's like,"
54:55;54:57;"the critical perspective"
54:57;55:00;"kind of runs into the kind vibe side,"
55:00;55:01;"and it just kind of like,"
55:01;55:03;"they fizzle out into just,"
55:03;55:05;"basically like a very straight ahead,"
55:05;55:06;"just like,"
55:06;55:07;"all right, gang,"
55:07;55:09;"if you love fast food as much as we do,"
55:09;55:10;"you should try the TC challenge."
55:10;55:12;"We're doing Dunkin' for breakfast,"
55:12;55:13;"Subway for lunch,"
55:13;55:14;"Mickey D's for dinner."
55:14;55:15;"Order what you want,"
55:15;55:16;"but you gotta hit all three."
55:16;55:19;"(laughing)"
55:19;55:21;"That is so weak."
55:21;55:23;"(laughing)"
55:23;55:24;"I hope,"
55:24;55:26;"I don't want any listeners to actually do that"
55:26;55:27;"on account of the show."
55:27;55:28;"Yeah, please don't."
55:28;55:29;"I'm not gonna do it."
55:29;55:30;"There's no way I'm gonna do that."
55:30;55:31;"Okay, how about,"
55:31;55:32;"Jake,"
55:32;55:34;"you can pick anyone you want,"
55:34;55:36;"but for one day,"
55:36;55:37;"each meal,"
55:37;55:38;"breakfast, lunch, and dinner"
55:38;55:40;"has to be a Subway protein bowl."
55:40;55:41;"Wait, what?"
55:41;55:43;"I have to eat three Subway protein bowls?"
55:43;55:45;"Yeah, but they have a lot,"
55:45;55:46;"so you could do,"
55:46;55:47;"for instance,"
55:47;55:48;"you could do the Italian--"
55:48;55:50;"Is there a breakfast bowl?"
55:50;55:51;"Um, no,"
55:51;55:52;"but there's a,"
55:52;55:54;"you could do tuna bowl for breakfast,"
55:54;55:57;"meatball marinara for lunch,"
55:57;56:00;"chicken and bacon ranch."
56:00;56:01;"Aw,"
56:01;56:03;"ranch is so nasty."
56:03;56:04;"(laughing)"
56:04;56:07;"The TC challenge"
56:07;56:11;"is that you have to spend $20.14 annually"
56:11;56:12;"at Subway."
56:12;56:14;"Yeah, exactly."
56:14;56:16;"We don't care when you spend it,"
56:16;56:18;"but every year,"
56:18;56:20;"it's a 10-year challenge."
56:20;56:22;"In honor of the late Fred DeLuca,"
56:22;56:24;"we're challenging all of our listeners"
56:24;56:27;"to hit Fred's financial goals."
56:27;56:28;"Well, shout out to Subway,"
56:28;56:29;"shout out to Connecticut."
56:29;56:31;"Connecticut pulling its weight."
56:31;56:32;"Jake, I talked to,"
56:32;56:35;"I did an interview with Goose this morning."
56:35;56:36;"Oh, wow."
56:36;56:37;"For Relics."
56:37;56:38;"Cool."
56:38;56:39;"I guess they're profiling Goose,"
56:39;56:40;"and they want to have a little sidebar thing"
56:40;56:41;"where we talk to them."
56:41;56:43;"The journalist from Relics asked, like,"
56:43;56:45;"""How'd Goose first got on my radar?"""
56:45;56:46;"So, of course, I explained, you know,"
56:46;56:48;"Stephen Hyden called him to the show."
56:48;56:49;"And he's like,"
56:49;56:50;"""So what made you interested in them"
56:50;56:51;"in the first place?"""
56:51;56:52;"And I said, ""Well, here's the thing."
56:52;56:54;"My co-host Jake is from Connecticut,"
56:54;56:55;"and he often says"
56:55;56:56;"Connecticut's not pulling its weight."
56:56;56:58;"So it was very exciting to hear about"
56:58;57:00;"a young band from Connecticut"
57:00;57:02;"making some waves."""
57:02;57:03;"Then they were talking about a lot of other bands"
57:03;57:05;"from the Connecticut band scene,"
57:05;57:07;"which we should probably go deeper on sometime."
57:07;57:09;"Also, Goose is just a great band name."
57:09;57:10;"I mean, that's such a catch."
57:10;57:11;"Yes, I said the same thing."
57:11;57:12;"I was like, first of all--"
57:12;57:14;"Wait, there's a band called Goose?"
57:14;57:16;"A jam band called Goose from Connecticut."
57:16;57:17;"Like--"
57:17;57:18;"Oh, man."
57:18;57:20;"That's already 90% of their--"
57:20;57:21;"and then the music's--"
57:21;57:22;"they're actually a great band."
57:22;57:23;"Even better."
57:23;57:25;"Stumble every time you do it"
57:25;57:28;"Ain't never gonna get used to it"
57:28;57:30;"Hanging on a garden rose"
57:30;57:33;"Untamed the way that my love grows"
57:33;57:35;"Oh Lord, I didn't see it coming"
57:35;57:38;"Arcadia's got me running"
57:38;57:40;"Just trying not to lose my breath"
57:40;57:43;"'Cause hell, I'm gonna take that step"
57:43;57:47;"And though my pride is going way down the line"
57:50;57:53;"I'm just fine"
57:54;57:57;"[instrumental break]"
58:32;58:37;"My luck is all that I have today"
58:37;58:43;"But it's no wonder that you found me"
58:43;58:47;"Buried underneath my weight"
58:47;58:56;"Well, I would still take little red pills"
58:56;59:00;"Maybe you're all that hold me up"
59:01;59:04;"But you pulled the blinds"
59:04;59:06;"In this room of mine"
59:06;59:08;"It's just a little bit brighter"
59:08;59:10;"Since you came"
59:10;59:13;"Oh, I stumble every time you do it"
59:13;59:16;"Ain't never gonna get used to it"
59:16;59:18;"Hanging on a garden rose"
59:18;59:21;"Untamed the way that my love grows"
59:21;59:23;"Oh Lord, I didn't see it coming"
59:23;59:26;"Arcadia's got me running"
59:26;59:28;"Just trying not to lose my breath"
59:28;59:31;"'Cause hell, I'm gonna take that step"
59:31;59:35;"Seep up all the light"
59:35;59:40;"From the bottom of the spine"
59:40;59:46;"Don't fret, don't hang your head"
59:46;59:51;"'Cause I'm just fine"
59:51;59:54;"So, we're hitting a lot of ""this show sucks"" moments."
59:54;59:57;"That's TC, we kind of get into that just like deep."
59:57;01:00:01;"Just kind of like dry fast food news."
01:00:01;01:00:02;"Yeah."
01:00:02;01:00:04;"That's a version of this show that we have to avoid"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"where it is just kind of like"
01:00:06;01:00:10;"""Wendy's announced a new spin on the Baconator."""
01:00:10;01:00:11;"Jake, you try it?"
01:00:11;01:00:13;"No, I haven't had the chance yet."
01:00:13;01:00:16;"Let's say for the next episode we all try the new chicken Baconator."
01:00:16;01:00:18;"What else, what else?"
01:00:18;01:00:21;"I went to Taco Bell the other day."
01:00:21;01:00:25;"No, but there is legitimately some very TC news happening"
01:00:25;01:00:30;"with Taco Bell dropping what I believe are the first fast food NFTs."
01:00:30;01:00:34;"So, who wants to explain what NFTs are?"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"I mean, Jake, do you already know?"
01:00:36;01:00:39;"They're nifty fun toys, right?"
01:00:39;01:00:42;"Jake spent five days in the hospital when he came out."
01:00:42;01:00:45;"Taco Bell was making fricking NFTs."
01:00:45;01:00:47;"You're Rip Van Winkle."
01:00:47;01:00:49;"It's like you're in prison for 40 years."
01:00:49;01:00:52;"Come out to a totally new world."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"Wait a second, corporations are making art,"
01:00:55;01:00:58;"like discreet art objects that you can buy one of a kind?"
01:00:58;01:01:01;"Imagine that, like Taco Bell was sort of like,"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"""We're having a painting exhibition."""
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Why not?"
01:01:04;01:01:08;"Who did the paintings? Taco Bell did the paintings."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"I mean, honestly, that is the next phase of like,"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"you know, we've been covering this for years now,"
01:01:12;01:01:17;"but of all like the kind of gimmicky, funny corporate sh*t."
01:01:17;01:01:22;"Oh, like Kentucky Fried Chicken made a Lifetime movie."
01:01:22;01:01:25;"And somebody else did a, you know, a street wear drop."
01:01:25;01:01:28;"And, you know, McDonald's and Travis Scott did all this stuff."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"Like maybe it is eventually just getting back to like"
01:01:30;01:01:33;"old school corporate kind of like classy sh*t."
01:01:33;01:01:36;"Where it's like not some big kind of viral joke."
01:01:36;01:01:39;"Where it is like, Taco Bell has like a serious art collection."
01:01:39;01:01:41;"They exhibit it sometimes."
01:01:41;01:01:43;"Like, what? You know, you think that's weird?"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"Oh, that I could see. I could see that."
01:01:45;01:01:47;"You think JP Morgan doesn't own a lot of art"
01:01:47;01:01:49;"that they exhibit here and there."
01:01:49;01:01:53;"And it's like, they kind of lose the millennial zany humor angle."
01:01:53;01:01:57;"And just kind of becomes like, we're a major global corporation."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"We consider part of our mission,"
01:01:59;01:02:03;"not just making money and serving great Mexican inspired cuisine."
01:02:03;01:02:07;"We also consider part of our mission to like enrich people's lives."
01:02:07;01:02:10;"And we're doing a dead-ass serious painting exhibition"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"where we're showing some of our collection."
01:02:12;01:02:15;"We paid top dollar from some of the best artists around the world."
01:02:15;01:02:18;"You know, like start acting with like the prestige of like investment banks."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"LACMA is expanding."
01:02:20;01:02:24;"And one of their things that we're excited about is the new Taco Bell wing."
01:02:24;01:02:25;"Yeah, seriously."
01:02:25;01:02:26;"At LACMA."
01:02:26;01:02:27;"I could see that."
01:02:27;01:02:29;"Taco Bell Stadium in Idaho. Why not?"
01:02:29;01:02:32;"I was making a weird joke of Taco Bell making..."
01:02:32;01:02:35;"Because Taco Bell released NFTs, right?"
01:02:35;01:02:36;"Like Taco Bell released art."
01:02:36;01:02:39;"So first we should actually explain what NFTs are for..."
01:02:39;01:02:42;"Because this is something that two weeks ago,"
01:02:42;01:02:44;"very few people were talking about."
01:02:44;01:02:47;"And now it's like everyone and their mothers dropping NFTs."
01:02:47;01:02:48;"It's so dumb."
01:02:48;01:02:52;"It screams like tulip bubble, if anything does."
01:02:52;01:02:53;"I mean, it's so funny."
01:02:53;01:02:55;"Seinfeld, do you want to jump in?"
01:02:55;01:02:56;"Because you had sent that article."
01:02:56;01:02:57;"I mean..."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"Did I send that?"
01:02:58;01:02:59;"I don't think I sent that."
01:02:59;01:03:02;"Seinfeld, do you feel you can explain?"
01:03:02;01:03:05;"I can do very high level."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"I kind of consider you..."
01:03:07;01:03:10;"Seinfeld as our kind of social media person."
01:03:10;01:03:15;"That kind of makes you also our lead science and technology reporter."
01:03:15;01:03:19;"Yeah, I definitely consider myself a tech guru in the crew."
01:03:19;01:03:24;"And I'll tell you also that I did put an NFT for Seinfeld 2008."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"That's right."
01:03:25;01:03:27;"Yeah, online or what I..."
01:03:27;01:03:30;"I don't even think it's online, but a couple of weeks ago."
01:03:30;01:03:33;"And let me tell you, it didn't meet the minimum price."
01:03:33;01:03:37;"So somebody bid one ether, which was the minimum reserve."
01:03:37;01:03:39;"And then they withdrew their bid."
01:03:39;01:03:43;"So I was like, oh, because then I was looking at the conversion rate."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"And it was like $1,600."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"And I was like, this is the dumbest thing ever."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"Did I just make money out of thin air?"
01:03:48;01:03:52;"And then somebody probably came to their senses and withdrew it before the auction ended."
01:03:52;01:03:55;"Anyway, I'm already going on a tangent here."
01:03:55;01:03:58;"NFT on its most basic level is what?"
01:03:58;01:04:02;"It's a digital sort of virtual..."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"Token."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"Token. There you go. Thank you."
01:04:04;01:04:07;"That represents a piece of artwork."
01:04:07;01:04:14;"And I believe if you purchase one, that sort of makes you the owner of said artwork,"
01:04:14;01:04:17;"even though it's not a physical, tangible art, right?"
01:04:17;01:04:20;"You own the rights to that art online."
01:04:20;01:04:21;"Does that sound..."
01:04:21;01:04:22;"You don't own the rights."
01:04:22;01:04:24;"No, you own the digital information."
01:04:24;01:04:29;"I mean, it's like cryptocurrency, but this is a crypto art object, right?"
01:04:29;01:04:34;"In a way of my understanding, non-fungible token is what it obviously stands for,"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"meaning that you own..."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"It's basically verifiable."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"You own the rights to it."
01:04:40;01:04:43;"So while other people can kind of copy or cut and paste it,"
01:04:43;01:04:45;"just the way you could a painting, right?"
01:04:45;01:04:49;"Like you can sell prints of the painting, but you own the painting."
01:04:49;01:04:50;"You own that."
01:04:50;01:04:51;"When you buy it, you own it."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"That's what an NFT is."
01:04:53;01:04:59;"So if you were to buy Jake's Blockbuster NFT, you own that."
01:04:59;01:05:03;"So yes, other people can screen share it, they can copy it,"
01:05:03;01:05:09;"but the fundamental verifiable ownership of that is to the person who has purchased it."
01:05:09;01:05:13;"So theoretically, you could also make money by owning an NFT."
01:05:13;01:05:14;"If you sold it."
01:05:14;01:05:15;"No, you don't own the rights."
01:05:15;01:05:16;"You don't own the rights."
01:05:16;01:05:17;"Okay."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"No, no, no."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"You do."
01:05:19;01:05:20;"Yeah, that's what I thought too."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"No, you don't."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"If you buy a painting."
01:05:24;01:05:27;"If you buy a painting, you don't own the rights to the painting."
01:05:27;01:05:29;"No, you own the physical object."
01:05:29;01:05:30;"That's all you own."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"And I think it's the same with NFT."
01:05:32;01:05:33;"You own."
01:05:33;01:05:34;"It truly is like."
01:05:34;01:05:35;"It's not fungible."
01:05:35;01:05:36;"It's all you're buying."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"Oh, wait."
01:05:37;01:05:38;"So, so Jake."
01:05:38;01:05:39;"The tokens are not fungible, man."
01:05:39;01:05:40;"What do you mean?"
01:05:40;01:05:42;"If I bought your painting, I have a painting in my house."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"You can just take it back?"
01:05:44;01:05:45;"No, you have the object."
01:05:45;01:05:46;"No, but you can't."
01:05:46;01:05:47;"You don't own the image."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"You can't start printing it."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"Yeah."
01:05:49;01:05:50;"You can't start printing up t-shirts."
01:05:50;01:05:51;"I could."
01:05:52;01:05:53;"Nick, you don't own the image."
01:05:53;01:05:54;"Like, like."
01:05:54;01:05:55;"I know."
01:05:55;01:05:56;"Yes, you own the object."
01:05:56;01:05:57;"That's sorry."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"That is what I'm."
01:05:58;01:05:59;"That is what I'm trying to say."
01:05:59;01:06:00;"So you own that."
01:06:00;01:06:01;"Yes, other people can reprint it."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"They can cut, copy and paste it."
01:06:02;01:06:07;"But the actual object itself, the digital object, you have the rights to."
01:06:07;01:06:08;"And exactly."
01:06:08;01:06:09;"A blockchain."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"Well, you don't have the rights to you."
01:06:10;01:06:11;"Yeah, you own that."
01:06:11;01:06:12;"You own the digital information."
01:06:12;01:06:17;"It's an oxymoron because you said the word digital object, which doesn't exist."
01:06:17;01:06:18;"It makes no sense."
01:06:18;01:06:21;"That's why NFTs, it truly is just bragging rights."
01:06:21;01:06:25;"Now you could make make the argument that buying expensive art is similar."
01:06:25;01:06:30;"But in that case, you actually have a physical object that you can hang on the wall or put"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"into storage or burn if you want."
01:06:32;01:06:37;"But with the NFT, it's like you're literally just owning the bragging rights, being like"
01:06:37;01:06:43;"there's this clip of Michael Jordan dunking that the NBA sold that's on YouTube."
01:06:43;01:06:44;"But they issued one token."
01:06:44;01:06:45;"Right."
01:06:45;01:06:46;"Which, and that's all it is."
01:06:46;01:06:51;"It's just like, I guess, I mean, this is what I imagine sort of every clubhouse conversation"
01:06:51;01:06:52;"is like right now."
01:06:52;01:06:59;"But I do think that I don't know the difference between then like having the Mona Lisa and"
01:06:59;01:07:02;"then having a print in your dorm room of the Mona Lisa."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"It's just like, yes, there's you."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"It is all bragging rights, I guess."
01:07:06;01:07:12;"It's conceptual, too, because it's like if the artists themselves or the rights holder"
01:07:12;01:07:18;"creates one NFT, yeah, you kind of have the bragging rights of saying I bought the one"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"they made."
01:07:20;01:07:24;"So like, friends, I guess to take it back in the day, if there were NFTs in the time"
01:07:24;01:07:31;"of Da Vinci and Da Vinci did create one digital version of the Mona Lisa that had a unique"
01:07:31;01:07:37;"place in the ether chain or whatever, you know, like I guess it might be meaningful"
01:07:37;01:07:42;"if somebody said, oh, yeah, the Louvre owns the actual Mona Lisa, but I own the one NFT"
01:07:42;01:07:43;"that Da Vinci created."
01:07:43;01:07:46;"I guess that would probably be valuable today."
01:07:46;01:07:47;"Right."
01:07:47;01:07:48;"And then you could verify it, too."
01:07:48;01:07:51;"Somebody say, are you sure you own the one and be like, check it out, man."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"It's in the ledger."
01:07:53;01:07:54;"It's in the ether ledger."
01:07:54;01:07:55;"Yes, I do own it."
01:07:55;01:07:57;"You can follow the chain from Da Vinci to me."
01:07:57;01:08:00;"That could be meaningful to people."
01:08:00;01:08:02;"And most importantly, man, it's non fungible."
01:08:02;01:08:04;"Lot of tokens are fungible."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"These are not."
01:08:05;01:08:07;"Yeah, there's no funging it."
01:08:07;01:08:10;"This is not your granddad's token, man."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"It's not fungible."
01:08:11;01:08:13;"You can't abscond with it, man."
01:08:13;01:08:18;"You can't abscond with the token."
01:08:18;01:08:23;"If they had NFTs back in the early 70s, man, Mickey Hart wouldn't have had to leave the"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"band for a couple of years."
01:08:25;01:08:26;"Things would have worked out."
01:08:26;01:08:47;"But, man, it's not fungible."
01:08:47;01:09:15;"It's not fungible."
01:09:15;01:09:42;"I've had people explain to me like how and why the technology behind Ethereum and other"
01:09:42;01:09:47;"cryptos could be incredibly useful and even form a whole new type of Internet, change"
01:09:47;01:09:48;"the world."
01:09:48;01:09:51;"People have made convincing cases for that."
01:09:51;01:09:55;"NFTs, that's up to the marketplace to decide if that's going to have value into the future."
01:09:55;01:10:02;"It is interesting that it went so quickly from, it became a meme so quickly."
01:10:02;01:10:06;"It's not like something that for like, you know, for five years, it was actually just"
01:10:06;01:10:09;"like really interesting artists were making these NFTs or whatever."
01:10:09;01:10:14;"This is starting in like, you know, NBA, Taco Bell universe."
01:10:14;01:10:16;"Kings of Leon are the first band to do it."
01:10:16;01:10:19;"I kind of remember hearing about it a couple of weeks ago and thinking to myself, I wonder"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"if any like musicians will do it."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"And it's like clockwork."
01:10:22;01:10:24;"It's like, boom, Kings of Leon."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"I wouldn't have guessed it was them, but you know, they did it."
01:10:26;01:10:29;"It's a speculative store of value, basically."
01:10:29;01:10:33;"It's like, which is kind of what some people say all currencies are."
01:10:33;01:10:37;"You see a lot of times when people debate like Bitcoin, somebody and somebody be like,"
01:10:37;01:10:41;"it's not gold and somebody be like, gold has no inherent value either."
01:10:41;01:10:43;"People can get in that."
01:10:43;01:10:47;"But it is funny because things that tend to be very valuable in the art world, those prices"
01:10:47;01:10:51;"are determined by a very small group of people."
01:10:51;01:10:54;"So could, I don't know."
01:10:54;01:10:56;"So what are these Taco Bell NFTs anyway?"
01:10:56;01:10:57;"Their images?"
01:10:57;01:11:00;"They sold them for a dollar, which respect."
01:11:00;01:11:03;"Dollar menu, non fungible tokens."
01:11:03;01:11:08;"You know, actually there is a nice resonance with NFTs and Subway because it reminds me"
01:11:08;01:11:11;"it's like it doesn't it's not about the image or the aesthetic or the art."
01:11:11;01:11:15;"It's sort of just like putting your money into this place and that that's going to do"
01:11:15;01:11:16;"the job."
01:11:16;01:11:18;"Whereas like in Subway, it's the same thing."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"I'm just like it's the food is not the point."
01:11:20;01:11:21;"Right."
01:11:21;01:11:22;"The art is not the point."
01:11:22;01:11:24;"It's sort of just like a bubble right now."
01:11:24;01:11:25;"Put your money in."
01:11:25;01:11:27;"Well, yeah, then you got to wonder."
01:11:27;01:11:28;"Eat lunch."
01:11:28;01:11:29;"Right."
01:11:29;01:11:31;"Are people reselling NFTs for big money?"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"Oh, yeah."
01:11:32;01:11:34;"I think the Taco Bell ones, they sold for a dollar."
01:11:34;01:11:40;"Then people started selling them for whatever, hundreds of dollars, thousands."
01:11:40;01:11:43;"Maybe in a year we'll be looking back and being like, damn, should have bought some"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"of those Taco Bell NFTs."
01:11:45;01:11:52;"So to me, the interesting part is a corporation issuing art, capital A art, which is much"
01:11:52;01:11:56;"different than when we were talking about like the Taco Bell wing of LACMA."
01:11:56;01:11:57;"Right."
01:11:57;01:11:58;"They're not sponsoring art."
01:11:58;01:11:59;"They're not collecting art."
01:11:59;01:12:00;"They're not buying."
01:12:00;01:12:01;"Taco Bell made art."
01:12:01;01:12:02;"Right."
01:12:02;01:12:05;"That's new and weird and dumb."
01:12:05;01:12:09;"It's a new, weird, dumb time to be alive."
01:12:09;01:12:10;"Taco Bell."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"Yeah, I got to bring an image of this up."
01:12:12;01:12:13;"Yeah."
01:12:13;01:12:17;"I mean, they're just kind of like ugly gifts."
01:12:17;01:12:19;"Some people have already resold for over three thousand dollars."
01:12:19;01:12:20;"So that's decent."
01:12:20;01:12:22;"I mean, how many did they put out?"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"I wonder."
01:12:23;01:12:24;"Not a lot."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"I mean, people are spending money."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"OK, so and by the way, Jake."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"Oh, five copies."
01:12:29;01:12:35;"This is important to note that Taco Bell says all profits will go towards its Live Moss"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"scholarship."
01:12:37;01:12:40;"So we should probably check what that is."
01:12:40;01:12:42;"Live Moss scholarship."
01:12:42;01:12:46;"It's not based on your grades or how well you play sports."
01:12:46;01:12:50;"It's about students passionate about creating a better future."
01:12:50;01:12:55;"Grimes sold her digital collection for five point eight million dollars, which means she's"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"getting out at the right time."
01:12:57;01:12:58;"Damn."
01:12:58;01:13:00;"That's a whole collection."
01:13:00;01:13:01;"Yeah, it really is."
01:13:01;01:13:02;"Wow."
01:13:02;01:13:06;"Has no one asked you to make an NFT, Ezra?"
01:13:06;01:13:11;"I've had some conversations with people like you heard about this and I was kind of like,"
01:13:11;01:13:14;"yeah, no, I think we probably missed the NFT boat."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"I guess you could consider it."
01:13:17;01:13:18;"Cryptocurrency is interesting."
01:13:18;01:13:21;"I don't know if this is up my alley, but we'll see."
01:13:21;01:13:23;"I got to do some more research."
01:13:23;01:13:31;"I have a friend who trying to explain to me NFTs a couple of months ago told me that he"
01:13:31;01:13:38;"has bought all of the garbage pail kids in NFTs because that's where they exist now."
01:13:38;01:13:43;"That helped me understand, you know, where it was trading cards for us."
01:13:43;01:13:48;"Right now, NFT garbage pail kids."
01:13:48;01:13:52;"And he reminds me a lot of of cards."
01:13:52;01:13:53;"And that helped me understand it."
01:13:53;01:13:58;"And it's also pretty silly is that he bought, I think, like a couple hundred dollars worth"
01:13:58;01:14:03;"of garbage pail NFTs and they're probably worth about seven thousand dollars now."
01:14:03;01:14:06;"OK, he should sell now."
01:14:06;01:14:07;"I wonder."
01:14:07;01:14:11;"I bet they'll be worthless in six months, but I don't know anything."
01:14:11;01:14:12;"I'm an idiot."
01:14:12;01:14:26;"I'm painting, I'm painting again."
01:14:26;01:14:47;"I'm painting again."
01:14:47;01:15:09;"I'm painting again."
01:15:09;01:15:37;"I'm painting again."
01:15:37;01:15:44;"I'm painting again."
01:15:44;01:15:55;"I'm painting again."
01:15:55;01:16:21;"I'm painting again."
01:16:21;01:16:50;"I'm painting again."
01:16:50;01:16:54;"all right, we're going to have to figure out how to dramatize that."
01:16:54;01:16:59;"Well, I love, I mean, I could picture like the cinematic grandeur though, because he's"
01:16:59;01:17:04;"coming from this working class background. They moved from the Bronx to Bridgeport."
01:17:04;01:17:11;"And then Peter Buck's living in this sprawling White House with two car garage, huge green lawn."
01:17:11;01:17:14;"I'm picturing like the beautiful crane shot like right over the house."
01:17:14;01:17:15;"I like that element of it."
01:17:15;01:17:16;"Expansive."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"The working class Italian dude."
01:17:18;01:17:20;"Lush Connecticut suburbia."
01:17:20;01:17:26;"And then the all American 1965 Senator's son kind of Peter Buck guy."
01:17:26;01:17:27;"Yeah. Yeah."
01:17:27;01:17:32;"Also, maybe again, you know much more about these people from the book,"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"but I like the idea of like Fred DeLuca."
01:17:34;01:17:39;"Maybe he's played by Michael Imperioli, kind of like passionate guy."
01:17:39;01:17:41;"A little old, but yeah."
01:17:41;01:17:43;"We'll de-age him like the Irishman."
01:17:43;01:17:46;"But also I know nothing about..."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"60 million dollars in de-aging."
01:17:48;01:17:51;"But let's have him be like a really emotive actor."
01:17:51;01:17:52;"Yeah."
01:17:52;01:17:56;"And then the Peter Buck character from the wealthier family."
01:17:56;01:18:00;"I like the idea of him being like a Michael Shannon character,"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"just kind of like a weird, eerie dude."
01:18:02;01:18:03;"Like stoic as hell."
01:18:03;01:18:07;"Yeah. We're just kind of like a dead-eyed, kind of like creepy."
01:18:07;01:18:10;"No disrespect to the Buck family."
01:18:10;01:18:14;"This is pure conjecture, but just kind of like a creepy, like dead-eyed fella."
01:18:14;01:18:15;"Yeah."
01:18:15;01:18:19;"And that, you know, Fred DeLuca is like, ""Pete, man, how am I going to pay for college?"""
01:18:19;01:18:21;"He just like looks straight past him."
01:18:21;01:18:26;"And he's like, ""You should open a chain of 32 submarine sandwich restaurants."""
01:18:26;01:18:27;"And then just like walks away."
01:18:27;01:18:29;"Yeah, just walks away."
01:18:29;01:18:29;"It's just..."
01:18:29;01:18:32;"Yeah. And then DeLuca is just standing there like, ""What?"""
01:18:32;01:18:37;"And he's just like, ""I'm leaving. See you later."""
01:18:37;01:18:40;"And he's like, ""I couldn't stop thinking about it. Why the number 32?"""
01:18:40;01:18:41;"And then he like kind of comes back to him and he's like,"
01:18:41;01:18:45;"""Did I hallucinate this? Or did you just say to me that"
01:18:45;01:18:49;"to pay for college, I should open up 32 submarine sandwich restaurants?"""
01:18:49;01:18:51;"""Yes, that's what I said. It'll take about 10 years."
01:18:51;01:18:55;"After that, once we make it to 33, the growth will be explosive."
01:18:55;01:18:59;"I imagine that by 1994, we could get to 8,000."""
01:18:59;01:19:01;"He's like, ""Pete, you're freaking me out, man."""
01:19:01;01:19:03;"He's like, ""We can do this."""
01:19:03;01:19:07;"And then he peels off 10 crisp $100 bills."
01:19:07;01:19:09;"I don't know anything about sandwiches."
01:19:09;01:19:10;"Take this money."
01:19:10;01:19:11;"This is your startup money."
01:19:11;01:19:12;"Take this money."
01:19:12;01:19:13;"Go to the..."
01:19:13;01:19:14;"Find us a location."
01:19:14;01:19:15;"Go to the grocery store."
01:19:15;01:19:20;"Buy some cold cuts, some bread, some tomatoes, and some lettuce."
01:19:20;01:19:21;"It's very simple."
01:19:21;01:19:23;"If you build it, they will come."
01:19:23;01:19:24;"Maybe there is a sci-fi element."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"Maybe Peter Buck was sent from the future."
01:19:26;01:19:29;"He actually knew what was to come to pass."
01:19:29;01:19:32;"And he took Fred DeLuca on this journey."
01:19:32;01:19:34;"Maybe it's the Peter Buck from REM."
01:19:34;01:19:35;"He goes back in time."
01:19:35;01:19:38;"Peter Buck made so much money when REM was at their peak."
01:19:38;01:19:43;"He built a time machine, went back to 1965."
01:19:43;01:19:45;"And this is the reality that we're living in, actually."
01:19:45;01:19:46;"Oh, yeah."
01:19:46;01:19:50;"When REM first came up in the '80s and the '90s, Subway didn't exist."
01:19:50;01:19:55;"And then in 1991, Peter Buck built a time machine, went back to 1965,"
01:19:55;01:20:01;"and started a tangent of reality in which Subway sandwich shops went global."
01:20:01;01:20:03;"And that's the reality that we're in right now."
01:20:03;01:20:08;"Because there's an alternate reality where Mike Davis and his upstate sandwich shops"
01:20:08;01:20:09;"were the Subway and took over."
01:20:09;01:20:10;"Yes."
01:20:11;01:20:11;"That's great."
01:20:11;01:20:14;"It starts with an earthquake."
01:20:14;01:20:16;"Birds and snakes and aeroplane."
01:20:16;01:20:18;"And Lenny Bruce is not afraid."
01:20:18;01:20:21;"I am a hurricane."
01:20:21;01:20:22;"Listen to yourself, churn."
01:20:22;01:20:23;"World serves its own needs."
01:20:23;01:20:24;"Dummies serve your own needs."
01:20:24;01:20:26;"Feed it off an ox feet grunt."
01:20:26;01:20:26;"No strength."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"The latter starts a clatter with fear."
01:20:28;01:20:29;"Fight down high."
01:20:29;01:20:31;"Fire and a fire represent a seven gauge."
01:20:31;01:20:34;"And a government for hire and a combat sight."
01:20:34;01:20:37;"Left and west are coming in a hurry with the furies beating down your neck."
01:20:38;01:20:40;"Team by team reformers battle Trump, Tether, Croft."
01:20:40;01:20:41;"Look at that."
01:20:41;01:20:42;"No claims."
01:20:42;01:20:42;"Fine."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"Then."
01:20:43;01:20:44;"Uh oh."
01:20:44;01:20:44;"Overflow."
01:20:44;01:20:45;"Population conifers."
01:20:45;01:20:46;"But it'll do."
01:20:46;01:20:46;"Save yourself."
01:20:46;01:20:47;"Sub yourself."
01:20:47;01:20:48;"World serves its own needs."
01:20:48;01:20:49;"Listen to your heart."
01:20:49;01:20:51;"Please dummy with the rapture and the reverence."
01:20:51;01:20:52;"Right."
01:20:52;01:20:52;"Right."
01:20:52;01:20:53;"You patriotic, patriotic."
01:20:53;01:20:54;"Slam."
01:20:54;01:20:54;"Fight."
01:20:54;01:20:54;"Right."
01:20:54;01:20:55;"Right."
01:20:55;01:20:55;"Feel it."
01:20:55;01:20:56;"Pretty."
01:20:56;01:20:56;"Sight."
01:20:56;01:21:00;"It's the end of the world as we know it."
01:21:00;01:21:05;"It's the end of the world as we know it."
01:21:05;01:21:09;"It's the end of the world as we know it."
01:21:09;01:21:11;"I feel fine."
01:21:11;01:21:15;"I mean, that is like a classic premise."
01:21:15;01:21:18;"And one I always think about is like, knowing everything you know now,"
01:21:18;01:21:22;"if you went back in time, what would you do?"
01:21:22;01:21:27;"There's been a million takes on this, but it is funny to think like, you know, obviously,"
01:21:27;01:21:33;"let's say you had a little money, you could probably make some good stock picks."
01:21:34;01:21:37;"But frankly, a lot of people, if you went back in time, you wouldn't have,"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"it wouldn't be like that easy."
01:21:39;01:21:44;"So it would about be how much like, I wonder how much like gumption it would take."
01:21:44;01:21:49;"Like, for instance, knowing what we know now about Subway, let's say Jake, let's say you"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"and I were sent back to 1965."
01:21:51;01:21:53;"Could we even do it?"
01:21:53;01:21:56;"We might not have the business acumen of a Fred DeLuca."
01:21:56;01:22:00;"I guess you and I, if we just found ourselves like we woke up and it's 1965,"
01:22:00;01:22:03;"we could just rip over to Bridgeport and at the very least, just kind of like try to"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"cut ourselves in with those dudes."
01:22:05;01:22:12;"Yeah, like, hey, listen, I'll invest $1,000 in and buy 5% of the company."
01:22:12;01:22:13;"Right."
01:22:13;01:22:15;"We probably couldn't compete with them, but we could probably maybe just go."
01:22:15;01:22:20;"I mean, also, what a grim, what a grim vision of time travel."
01:22:20;01:22:28;"Let's go back in time and then spend 30 years toiling, trading a Subway sandwich shop."
01:22:28;01:22:28;"Let's not have fun."
01:22:28;01:22:32;"Let's not go to concerts or like invest in stocks or bet on sports."
01:22:32;01:22:38;"Let's go back and start a chain restaurant and really work hard at it."
01:22:38;01:22:39;"Here's my hard sci-fi pitch."
01:22:39;01:22:43;"My hard sci-fi pitch is it's Jersey Mike."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"He's old."
01:22:45;01:22:49;"He's dedicated his life to these Subway sandwiches."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"He's unhappy."
01:22:50;01:22:53;"His life didn't turn out how he wanted."
01:22:53;01:22:55;"He goes back in time."
01:22:55;01:22:59;"He pretends to be Buck."
01:22:59;01:23:01;"He gives our guy the idea."
01:23:01;01:23:02;"Fred DeLuca."
01:23:02;01:23:06;"He gives Fred DeLuca the idea to open the sandwiches to take him out of business."
01:23:06;01:23:15;"So he loses the Subway war, loses the sandwich war, and then spends time with his family."
01:23:15;01:23:18;"So really our hero is Mike Davis."
01:23:18;01:23:20;"And how does--"
01:23:20;01:23:20;"Right."
01:23:20;01:23:23;"By the way, Mike Davis is not Jersey Mike."
01:23:23;01:23:23;"He's upstate Mike."
01:23:23;01:23:25;"Oh, he's upstate."
01:23:25;01:23:26;"Yeah, even more so."
01:23:26;01:23:27;"This whole time I've been thinking he's Jersey Mike."
01:23:27;01:23:28;"No, no."
01:23:28;01:23:30;"Mike Davis has been lost to history."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"He's an obscure figure."
01:23:32;01:23:36;"Although it's funny, there's also the Southern California-based writer Mike Davis."
01:23:36;01:23:37;"Yes."
01:23:37;01:23:39;"Maybe that's the same guy."
01:23:39;01:23:43;"All these Mike Davises are the same guy."
01:23:43;01:23:47;"He got run out of town in upstate New York, moved to LA, and started writing about urbanism."
01:23:47;01:23:50;"As you do."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"As one does."
01:23:52;01:23:54;"Only one of them is non-fungible."
01:23:54;01:23:58;"The non-fungible Mike Davis."
01:23:58;01:23:59;"Mike Davis, yeah."
01:23:59;01:24:02;"Someone gets sent back in time today, and they're just like--"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"They really got NFTs on their mind."
01:24:04;01:24:07;"They get sent back to 1965, and all they can think about is,"
01:24:07;01:24:08;"""All right, I'm going to be early on NFTs."""
01:24:08;01:24:16;"But they know nothing about the 50 years of history that led up to it."
01:24:16;01:24:19;"Just know nothing about actual computers."
01:24:19;01:24:26;"Just rolling up to an IBM supercomputer where there's 30 employees putting giant punch cards in,"
01:24:26;01:24:27;"and just being like, ""All right, guys."
01:24:27;01:24:29;"I'm about to blow your mind."""
01:24:29;01:24:30;"Non-fungible tokens."
01:24:30;01:24:34;"This is a million dollar idea."
01:24:34;01:24:37;"Grimes just made six million bucks selling them."
01:24:37;01:24:42;"With your guys' computer know-how and my vision of the future, we can make some serious cash."
01:24:42;01:24:44;"Oh my god."
01:24:44;01:24:51;"Just got to wait like 60 years."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"You know what?"
01:24:52;01:24:52;"We've definitely done--"
01:24:52;01:24:54;"I guess I'll open a Subway sandwich."
01:24:54;01:24:58;"We've definitely done a time travel bit on time crisis."
01:24:58;01:24:59;"I feel like it was--"
01:24:59;01:25:02;"I think it was like we got sent back to San Francisco."
01:25:02;01:25:03;"Yeah."
01:25:03;01:25:09;"And we had to be really careful when we went to see The Grateful Dead at Winterland or some sh*t,"
01:25:09;01:25:13;"because we wanted to catch the show but not to have a butterfly effect."
01:25:13;01:25:15;"I think we also wanted to--"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"Travis Scott, back to the future."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"Wasn't there a whole Travis Scott--"
01:25:18;01:25:20;"There was also Travis Scott back to the future."
01:25:20;01:25:21;"Yeah."
01:25:21;01:25:25;"But I think we also wanted to somehow spy on Charles Manson."
01:25:25;01:25:27;"Oh, maybe it was chaos related."
01:25:27;01:25:32;"Yeah, it was like we wanted to go back and just follow him around the hate and see if"
01:25:32;01:25:36;"he was talking to weird CIA operatives."
01:25:36;01:25:39;"But then while we're back there, we could also catch The Dead at the Fillmore."
01:25:39;01:25:40;"Right."
01:25:40;01:25:43;"I mean, if we're there, how could we not?"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"We get sent back to the mid-60s."
01:25:45;01:25:48;"We're just doing all sorts of stuff."
01:25:48;01:25:52;"We're investing early with Fred DeLuca and Subway."
01:25:52;01:25:56;"We're catching the first Warlocks gig at the pizzeria."
01:25:57;01:25:59;"In Palo Alto or whatever."
01:25:59;01:26:00;"Oh, in Menlo Park."
01:26:00;01:26:03;"We'd have to make an itinerary before we went back."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"We'd have to write down all the dates."
01:26:05;01:26:05;"Right."
01:26:05;01:26:09;"So we'd be back in the East Coast dealing with Fred DeLuca."
01:26:09;01:26:13;"Then we'd be like, ""Dude, Warlocks gig is in Palo Alto in two days."
01:26:13;01:26:17;"We got to get on a Pan Am flight pronto and get out there."""
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Forget about the butterfly effect for a second."
01:26:19;01:26:23;"But we end up in the mid-60s and we're just putting our heads together just to remember"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"every historically significant thing."
01:26:25;01:26:32;"And then one day, we look back 10 years later and we're super rich and just be like,"
01:26:32;01:26:36;"""Yeah, these two weird dudes, nobody knew where they came from, named Jake and Ezra."
01:26:36;01:26:40;"These guys have a significant stake in Subway."
01:26:40;01:26:43;"They own about 80 McDonald's in the Midwest."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"They manage the Grateful Dead."""
01:26:45;01:26:49;"They invented non-fungible tokens."
01:26:49;01:26:50;"Yeah."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"And they invented non-fungible tokens."
01:26:51;01:26:53;"I mean, you know, just a really interesting--"
01:26:53;01:26:54;"They started Apple computers."
01:26:54;01:26:56;"[laughter]"
01:26:56;01:26:59;"Just a real interesting portfolio for these dudes."
01:26:59;01:27:01;"They wrote some great songs too."
01:27:01;01:27:01;"I mean--"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"Wrote a lot of great songs."
01:27:03;01:27:05;"We could steal all the songs from the future."
01:27:05;01:27:06;"Oh, classic."
01:27:06;01:27:06;"They haven't written yet."
01:27:06;01:27:07;"Yeah, like the Beatles movie."
01:27:07;01:27:09;"Yeah."
01:27:09;01:27:12;"They financed Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver."
01:27:12;01:27:14;"[laughter]"
01:27:14;01:27:18;"I wish there was more time travel movies that were fun, like Back to the Future."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"Not like super serious like--"
01:27:20;01:27:20;"Right."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"I think just--"
01:27:21;01:27:21;"--looper or whatever the hell."
01:27:21;01:27:22;"I think part of it is--"
01:27:22;01:27:23;"Just like fun."
01:27:23;01:27:26;"Back to the Future is just so good that it's like--"
01:27:26;01:27:26;"Yeah."
01:27:26;01:27:27;"--it really sets the bar high."
01:27:27;01:27:28;"Bill and Ted's."
01:27:28;01:27:30;"Bill and Ted's fun."
01:27:30;01:27:31;"Bill and Ted's is cool."
01:27:31;01:27:37;"The part of Back to the Future when he's playing the Van Halen licks at the 1955 dance."
01:27:37;01:27:40;"I mean, that's just one of the most amazing scenes."
01:27:40;01:27:43;"And then like Chuck Berry's cousin is calling."
01:27:43;01:27:43;"It's just like--"
01:27:43;01:27:47;"That's truly like the epitome of time travel movie right there."
01:27:47;01:27:48;"That's it."
01:27:48;01:27:49;"Yeah, no."
01:27:49;01:27:50;"It's about as good as it gets."
01:27:50;01:27:51;"All right."
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Let's get in this top five."
01:27:52;01:27:55;"Number five, 1965."
01:27:55;01:27:58;"Herman's Hermits, Can't You Hear My Heartbeat."
01:27:58;01:28:07;"Nice hand claps."
01:28:07;01:28:11;"Baby, baby."
01:28:11;01:28:36;"What's DeLuca doing during this?"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"[APPLAUSE]"
01:28:39;01:28:48;"Yeah, he's driving around in his 1959 Chevy going to various suppliers around Bridgeport."
01:28:48;01:28:53;"He's got to go to the butcher, get the meat lined up, get the cheese lined up."
01:28:53;01:28:55;"He's got to go to the produce salesman."
01:28:55;01:28:58;"Ooh, yeah."
01:28:58;01:29:01;"And then like after this, it's like 10 years earlier."
01:29:01;01:29:04;"And then we'll see him sort of more destitute."
01:29:04;01:29:05;"You know?"
01:29:05;01:29:06;"Or not destitute, but needing--"
01:29:06;01:29:10;"Yeah, this is definitely not in my neighborhood."
01:29:10;01:29:15;"This is much more like industrious guy running errands on a Saturday."
01:29:15;01:29:19;"Yeah, this is not like mischievous, like in my neighborhood."
01:29:19;01:29:23;"[MUSIC - THE BATS, ""CAN'T YOU HEAR MY HEARTBEAT""]"
01:29:53;01:29:54;"Herman's Hermans have some gems."
01:29:54;01:29:55;"I mean, yeah, it's funny."
01:29:55;01:29:59;"Like that 1963 music still was very in my neighborhood."
01:29:59;01:30:03;"You listen to this '65, I mean, it's great."
01:30:03;01:30:08;"I guess it also makes you realize why like the Beatles were just like blowing people's minds."
01:30:08;01:30:10;"It's had a little more swagger."
01:30:10;01:30:12;"No, just Herman's Hermans are great."
01:30:12;01:30:13;"But like you can see--"
01:30:13;01:30:16;"It doesn't get more square than the Herman's Hermans, so that's for sure."
01:30:16;01:30:20;"It has a little more like groove and rock than some of that '63 [BLEEP]"
01:30:20;01:30:25;"But you can tell-- you can see why like '66, '67 were just insanely transformative years for"
01:30:25;01:30:27;"rock and roll and pop music."
01:30:27;01:30:28;"Number four."
01:30:28;01:30:30;"Oh, this is a classic."
01:30:30;01:30:34;"This is Roger Miller, King of the Road."

01:30:34;01:30:36;"You know this one, right?"
01:30:36;01:30:36;"All right."
01:30:36;01:30:38;"Of course."
01:30:38;01:30:44;"Yeah, picture going from that Herman's Hermans to like Jimi Hendrix two years later."
01:30:44;01:30:50;"[MUSIC - ROGER MILLER, ""KING OF THE ROAD""]"
01:30:50;01:30:51;"Great vocal tone."
01:30:51;01:30:52;"Yeah, great singer."
01:30:52;01:31:04;"[MUSIC - ROGER MILLER, ""KING OF THE ROAD""]"
01:31:04;01:31:24;"[LAUGHTER]"

01:31:25;01:31:48;"[MUSIC - ROGER MILLER, ""KING OF THE ROAD""]"
01:31:48;01:31:52;"So he's like a guy like hopping trains?"
01:31:52;01:31:55;"Yeah, actually now I'm confused about what the song is really about."
01:31:55;01:31:57;"I've never listened to the lyrics before."
01:31:57;01:32:03;"[MUSIC - ROGER MILLER, ""KING OF THE ROAD""]"
01:32:03;01:32:09;"It's funny because in the chorus he says, ""I'm a man of means, by no means, King of the Road."""
01:32:09;01:32:11;"So is he saying, ""I'm not the King of the Road""?"
01:32:11;01:32:14;"No, I think he's saying, ""I'm a man of means by no means."""
01:32:14;01:32:19;"Like he's not a man of means."
01:32:19;01:32:20;"Right."
01:32:20;01:32:26;"[MUSIC - ROGER MILLER, ""KING OF THE ROAD""]"
01:32:26;01:32:29;"So he's just living on the road, making money here and there?"
01:32:29;01:32:30;"Yeah."
01:32:30;01:32:35;"[MUSIC - ROGER MILLER, ""KING OF THE ROAD""]"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"I think the first time I heard this song was in Swingers."
01:32:37;01:32:39;"It's in Swingers?"
01:32:39;01:32:42;"Yeah, it's a pretty big moment in Swingers."
01:32:42;01:32:45;"Maybe on the way to Vegas?"
01:32:45;01:32:46;"Really?"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"I can't remember exactly where it was, but..."
01:32:48;01:32:48;"Good song."
01:32:48;01:32:54;"[MUSIC - ROGER MILLER, ""KING OF THE ROAD""]"
01:32:54;01:32:55;"It's funny."
01:32:55;01:32:59;"That song is objectively cooler than Herman's Hermits."
01:32:59;01:33:04;"Maybe because this new type of rock was still finding its footing,"
01:33:04;01:33:07;"whereas country was in this mature, cool place."
01:33:07;01:33:10;"Upright bass, the swagger."
01:33:10;01:33:13;"Yeah, I guess it's about a guy riding the rails."
01:33:14;01:33:20;"Also a perfect song for a montage of Fred DeLuca pounding the pavement."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"Oh, yeah."
01:33:21;01:33:22;"Not in--"
01:33:22;01:33:23;"""King of the Road,"" man."

01:33:25;01:33:31;"He's driving around Southern Connecticut, comparing prices from all these different suppliers."

01:34:20;01:34:25;"Right, so it's a montage of the fancy Connecticut barbecue."
01:34:25;01:34:26;"Right."
01:34:26;01:34:34;"And he pulls in and he's just gotten the semester fees and he's like, ""I can't afford to go to"

01:42:06;01:42:10;"Oh, wow. This is 65. I would guess that's like 64."
01:42:10;01:42:11;"I guess four. Yeah."
01:42:11;01:42:13;"Yeah, 65 transitional year."
01:42:13;01:42:16;"I guess it's early 65 too."
01:42:16;01:42:19;"We're only in March."
01:42:19;01:42:20;"Right."
01:42:20;01:42:31;"I mean, yeah, the Beatles had only been in America for a year at this point, I guess."
01:42:31;01:42:31;"So."
01:42:31;01:42:33;"Right. Ed Sullivan was 64."
01:42:33;01:42:36;"Yeah, I think like February of 64."
01:42:36;01:42:46;"Check this out. This is like classic crazy Beatles."
01:42:47;01:42:54;"This came out early 64. They released an album called Beatles 6 in June 65."
01:42:54;01:42:59;"And then just to give you a sense of what 1965 was like for them."
01:42:59;01:43:01;"So this is the first half of 1965."
01:43:01;01:43:09;"August 65, they released the album Help, which, you know, was also the soundtrack to the film"
01:43:09;01:43:15;"of the same name. And that had other huge songs like Yesterday, Help, Ticket to Ride."
01:43:15;01:43:20;"So that's August 65. And then December 3rd, 65 is Rubber Soul."
01:43:20;01:43:27;"So it's like, in this year, they had at minimum three distinct,"
01:43:27;01:43:31;"like hugely impactful eras all within one year."
01:43:31;01:43:35;"This part of the year, then the Help part of the year, and then just at the very end,"
01:43:35;01:43:38;"the Rubber Soul part of the year."
01:43:38;01:43:41;"I thought that was the following year. That's nuts."
01:43:41;01:43:43;"No, Revolver is the following year."
01:43:43;01:43:49;"Right. So this is the year they stopped touring too. Like they played the Shea Stadium show in 65 too."
01:43:49;01:43:53;"I think 66 is the last year they ever played Candlestick Park."
01:43:53;01:43:56;"Oh, really? How did they have time to make Rubber Soul?"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"They banged that out. I don't know."
01:44:07;01:44:14;"Girl, always on my mind One thing I can say"
01:44:14;01:44:25;"Girl, love you all the time Hold me, love me, hold me, love me"
01:44:25;01:44:36;"I ain't got nothin' but love, baby Hate days are weak, hate days are weak"
01:44:36;01:44:38;"Hate days are weak"
01:44:38;01:44:42;"Oh, yeah, the weird ending"
01:44:42;01:44:46;"Oh my, my, my, my, my, my, my"
01:44:46;01:44:50;"Yeah, the Beatles, I've been thinking more about the Beatles lately."
01:44:50;01:44:51;"Yeah?"
01:44:51;01:44:54;"They got that Get Back documentary coming out."
01:44:54;01:45:02;"Peter Jackson is making with, like, footage, I guess, that's never been used before from, like, the Let It Be era."
01:45:02;01:45:05;"I watched the trailer. I'm very excited about it."
01:45:05;01:45:09;"Just a very solid band, and influential."
01:45:09;01:45:11;"Good band."
01:45:11;01:45:17;"You know, the Beatles are, like, classic, like, you sometimes need to take a long time off from, like, thinking about them."
01:45:17;01:45:22;"Let them kind of, like, fade into the background, but, like, it's always so fun to go deep."
01:45:22;01:45:26;"But, yeah, the output, truly insane."
01:45:26;01:45:28;"Hate days are weak, not, like..."
01:45:28;01:45:29;"Not my favorite."
01:45:29;01:45:30;"Yeah, me neither."
01:45:30;01:45:34;"Weird that that was a hit the same year that, like, In My Life came out."
01:45:34;01:45:39;"Also, it's crazy they put out, like, Help and Rubber Soul the same year."
01:45:39;01:45:44;"Like, yesterday, and some of their most, like, beautiful songs coming out, like, four months apart."
01:45:44;01:45:45;"Right."
01:45:45;01:45:47;"I'm looking through you."
01:45:47;01:45:53;"Oh, yeah, that's... I'm Looking Through You is, like, that to me is, like, a major slept on Beatles song."
01:45:53;01:45:54;"As far as, like, non-singles go."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"Yeah."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"Right, you love that one too, right?"
01:45:57;01:45:58;"Yeah."
01:45:58;01:46:00;"Or I've Just Seen a Face."
01:46:00;01:46:02;"That's a... I love that one too."
01:46:02;01:46:04;"Those, like, McCartney acoustic numbers."
01:46:04;01:46:05;"Right."
01:46:05;01:46:08;"Things were changing very fast back then."
01:46:08;01:46:10;"I'm looking through you."
01:46:10;01:46:13;"Where did you go?"
01:46:13;01:46:16;"I thought I knew you."
01:46:16;01:46:19;"What did I know?"
01:46:19;01:46:24;"You don't look different, but you have changed."
01:46:24;01:46:27;"I'm looking through you."
01:46:27;01:46:29;"You're not the same."
01:46:30;01:46:33;"Your lips are moving."
01:46:33;01:46:36;"I cannot hear."
01:46:36;01:46:39;"Your voice is soothing."
01:46:39;01:46:42;"But the words aren't clear."
01:46:42;01:46:45;"You don't sound different."
01:46:45;01:46:48;"I've learned the game."
01:46:48;01:46:51;"I'm looking through you."
01:46:51;01:46:53;"You're not the same."
01:46:53;01:47:00;"Why tell me why?"
01:47:00;01:47:03;"You're right."
01:47:03;01:47:07;"Love has a nasty habit."
01:47:07;01:47:10;"You're feeling overnight."
01:47:10;01:47:13;"You're thinking of me."
01:47:13;01:47:15;"The same old way."
01:47:15;01:47:18;"You were above me."
01:47:18;01:47:20;"But not today."
01:47:20;01:47:26;"The only difference is your down breath."
01:47:26;01:47:29;"I'm looking through you."
01:47:29;01:47:32;"And you're my way."
01:47:32;01:47:34;"I mean, yeah, Beatles. What else is there to say?"
01:47:34;01:47:37;"I mean, that's dumb."
01:47:37;01:47:39;"I was going to say, I mean, it's really..."
01:47:39;01:47:42;"This is such, like, dorm room, like..."
01:47:42;01:47:44;"Alright, dude, favorite Beatles, straight up."
01:47:44;01:47:45;"Alright, let's do it."
01:47:45;01:47:47;"I understand it changes."
01:47:47;01:47:48;"Remember I was telling you about the game?"
01:47:48;01:47:51;"Just like, what's Time Crisis all about?"
01:47:51;01:47:55;"Well, like, they come up with, like, fun challenges."
01:47:55;01:47:59;"Like, hit Dunkin Donuts, Subway, and McDonald's in the same day."
01:47:59;01:48:00;"Protein Bowl."
01:48:00;01:48:02;"Okay, what else?"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"Well, there's also, like, the music side of it."
01:48:04;01:48:06;"They'll, like, list their top five favorite Beatles songs."
01:48:06;01:48:09;"Be like, okay."
01:48:09;01:48:11;"Um..."
01:48:11;01:48:13;"Man."
01:48:13;01:48:15;"Top five Beatles."
01:48:15;01:48:17;"I was telling you..."
01:48:17;01:48:19;"It's hard to do top five Beatles."
01:48:19;01:48:22;"On one of these episodes, a very fun game that we did"
01:48:22;01:48:26;"as a band when we were traveling to Chicago to play with you."
01:48:26;01:48:29;"Try to list the Beatles albums in order."
01:48:29;01:48:30;"Or, like, track by track."
01:48:30;01:48:31;"Like, track one of the White Albums."
01:48:31;01:48:32;"Go."
01:48:32;01:48:34;"And, like, try to list every track of the White Album in order."
01:48:34;01:48:35;"In order."
01:48:35;01:48:36;"That's very difficult."
01:48:36;01:48:37;"That's a fun game."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"That is a fun, dorky..."
01:48:39;01:48:42;"You're hanging out in a hotel room at one in the morning."
01:48:42;01:48:45;"And, like, not ready to go to bed yet."
01:48:45;01:48:46;"Dude, Abbey Road."
01:48:46;01:48:47;"Go."
01:48:47;01:48:48;"I think I'd be really bad at that, actually."
01:48:48;01:48:50;"I think I'd be good at..."
01:48:50;01:48:52;"Just 'cause I tend..."
01:48:52;01:48:55;"I think I'd be okay at listing every song on the album."
01:48:55;01:48:57;"The order would be very difficult."
01:48:57;01:49:00;"Track one White Album, back in the USSR, right?"
01:49:00;01:49:01;"Yeah."
01:49:01;01:49:04;"But then I get to track two, I'm already kind of lost."
01:49:04;01:49:06;"Prudence, dude."
01:49:06;01:49:07;"Is track two?"
01:49:07;01:49:08;"Uh-huh."
01:49:08;01:49:12;"And then I feel like Glass Onion is, like, six or something."
01:49:12;01:49:13;"No, Glass Onion's three."
01:49:13;01:49:14;"Oh, Glass Onion's three."
01:49:14;01:49:21;"I do it by, like, if I really get stuck, I try to, like, in my head, play the end of the song."
01:49:21;01:49:25;"And then, because I listened to that stuff so much as a kid, I can maybe..."
01:49:25;01:49:27;"Like, you know when you have, like, a mixtape?"
01:49:27;01:49:28;"Yeah."
01:49:28;01:49:31;"And you listen to it a million times, and then you're like, the song is fading out."
01:49:31;01:49:32;"And then, like..."
01:49:32;01:49:33;"And you know it's about to come in."
01:49:33;01:49:34;"Yeah."
01:49:34;01:49:37;"This makes me want to go listen to more Beatles albums, like, front to back."
01:49:37;01:49:40;"'Cause that's something I haven't done in decades."
01:49:40;01:49:43;"I also want to re-watch the Beatles Anthology."
01:49:43;01:49:45;"I remember really enjoying that."
01:49:45;01:49:48;"Dude, that'd be, like, a fun hang."
01:49:48;01:49:52;"Like, whatever, like, during COVID or not during COVID."
01:49:52;01:49:56;"But just, like, hang out and just, like, throw in a Beatles record."
01:49:56;01:49:58;"Just full 60s."
01:49:58;01:50:00;"Like, that would be, like, legit fun."
01:50:00;01:50:01;"Just, like, have a few drinks."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"Just throw in the White Album."
01:50:02;01:50:04;"We're listening to the entire White Album."
01:50:04;01:50:07;"Ezra and Jake invite you to a 1965 party."
01:50:07;01:50:08;"Dress appropriately."
01:50:08;01:50:11;"We're gonna listen to Rubber Soul, front to back, and eat Subway."
01:50:11;01:50:14;"[Laughter]"
01:50:14;01:50:17;"Why Subway?"
01:50:17;01:50:20;"Come on, guys."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"1969!"
01:50:22;01:50:25;"We're doing Abbey Road and we're ordering Wendy's."
01:50:25;01:50:28;"[Laughter]"
01:50:28;01:50:32;"What if we did, like, a whole series, like a Beatles listening series,"
01:50:32;01:50:36;"starting with the great albums that they released in 1965,"
01:50:36;01:50:40;"but then every year after, it's a new album, but it's still Subway?"
01:50:40;01:50:45;"It's just like, ""Alright, Ezra and Jake invite you to the Sgt. Pepper's party, man."
01:50:45;01:50:47;"Come through. We're gonna listen to it front to back."
01:50:47;01:50:51;"You know, it's '67, so feel free to get a little more psychedelic with your clothing."
01:50:51;01:50:53;"We will provide Subway."""
01:50:53;01:50:55;"Be like, ""Why Subway again?"""
01:50:55;01:50:58;"Be like, ""It was year two for Subway."""
01:50:58;01:51:01;"They opened their eighth location in '67."
01:51:01;01:51:04;"We can have, like, a permanent poster up at the party space"
01:51:04;01:51:07;"that'll say, like, current number of Subways."
01:51:07;01:51:10;"And it'll just be like, for the white album,"
01:51:10;01:51:13;"like, you know, like a baseball game, take it down,"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"it's just like, ""Four."""
01:51:15;01:51:17;"[Laughter]"
01:51:17;01:51:20;"Picture this, everybody. 1968."
01:51:20;01:51:22;"There are four Subways,"
01:51:22;01:51:25;"violence at the Democratic National Convention,"
01:51:25;01:51:27;"and the Beatles drop the white album."
01:51:27;01:51:30;"♪ Flew in from Miami Beach, B-O-A-C ♪"
01:51:30;01:51:33;"♪ Didn't get to bed last night ♪"
01:51:33;01:51:37;"♪ On the way to paperback was on my knee ♪"
01:51:37;01:51:39;"♪ Man, I had a dreadful flight ♪"
01:51:39;01:51:42;"♪ I'm back in the U.S.S.R. ♪"
01:51:42;01:51:46;"♪ You don't know how lucky you are, boy ♪"
01:51:46;01:51:48;"♪ Back in the U.S.S.R. ♪"
01:51:48;01:51:52;"We listen to, like, an early '90s McCartney solo album,"
01:51:52;01:51:54;"also eating Subway,"
01:51:54;01:51:57;"but now there's 8,000, 4,000?"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"37,000."
01:51:59;01:52:02;"What year did they open their 33rd location?"
01:52:02;01:52:04;"33rd?"
01:52:04;01:52:05;"That's when everything--"
01:52:05;01:52:06;"Oh, like '76."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"Yeah."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"That's when sh*t went crazy."
01:52:09;01:52:11;"All right, well, I think"
01:52:11;01:52:14;"maybe we're getting a little bit back more into this show rules territory."
01:52:14;01:52:17;"I think-- [Laughter]"
01:52:17;01:52:20;"The Duncan Subway McDonald's is a low point."
01:52:20;01:52:24;"Being on the precipice of just naming our top five Beatles songs"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"was perhaps a low point, but--"
01:52:26;01:52:27;"This show's ending very strong."
01:52:27;01:52:29;"But the Beatles Subway party,"
01:52:29;01:52:32;"I think that's something that we should legitimately do."
01:52:32;01:52:34;"We should each invite our friends and family,"
01:52:34;01:52:36;"especially as more people get vaccinated,"
01:52:36;01:52:38;"maybe this summer,"
01:52:38;01:52:40;"Jake and I host it."
01:52:40;01:52:43;"But also, that's something that TC heads can do as well."
01:52:43;01:52:46;"And it's called the Subway Series."
01:52:46;01:52:47;"It's called the Subway Series."
01:52:47;01:52:49;"This is our Subway Series."
01:52:49;01:52:50;"That's right."
01:52:50;01:52:51;"This is our Mets Yankees."
01:52:51;01:52:53;"And the Beatles famously played at Shea Stadium."
01:52:53;01:52:54;"Yeah, this one's strong."
01:52:54;01:52:57;"I feel like there's a lot of synergy happening right here."
01:52:57;01:52:59;"But anyway, we're going to start with help"
01:52:59;01:53:02;"and just get a bunch of subs from Subway."
01:53:02;01:53:03;"All right."
01:53:03;01:53:04;"In two weeks--"
01:53:04;01:53:07;"I just want to say this on the show to hold ourselves to it."
01:53:07;01:53:10;"I think we should finally talk about the Super Bowl."
01:53:10;01:53:11;"Cool."
01:53:11;01:53:14;"I think I'm finally ready to talk about them."
01:53:14;01:53:16;"Jake, who won the Super Bowl this year?"
01:53:16;01:53:17;"Do you know?"
01:53:17;01:53:18;"[Sigh]"
01:53:18;01:53:20;"Whoever Tom Brady was playing for."
01:53:20;01:53:22;"Florida something?"
01:53:22;01:53:23;"Okay, correct."
01:53:23;01:53:26;"Tom Brady and the--"
01:53:26;01:53:27;"And the Florida--"
01:53:27;01:53:29;"Florida Gators."
01:53:29;01:53:31;"And the Florida Gators took it."
01:53:31;01:53:34;"The easy way to remember what team Tom Brady plays for now"
01:53:34;01:53:37;"is the phrase ""Tompa Bay."""
01:53:37;01:53:41;"Because his name is Tom, and he lives in Tampa Bay."
01:53:41;01:53:43;"So just remember, ""Tompa Bay."""
01:53:43;01:53:45;"Wait, did you make that up, or is that a thing?"
01:53:45;01:53:46;"No, that's a thing."
01:53:46;01:53:47;"Right?"
01:53:47;01:53:48;"That is so weak."
01:53:48;01:53:49;"[Laughter]"
01:53:49;01:53:51;"That's not a thing!"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"""Tompa Bay."""
01:53:53;01:53:55;"Because Tom Brady moved to Tampa Bay."
01:53:55;01:53:56;"""Tampa Bay."""
01:53:56;01:53:58;"Is that a thing, Seinfeld?"
01:53:58;01:54:00;"Yeah, it's a thing."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"People call it ""Tampa Bay""?"
01:54:02;01:54:05;"Yeah, I assume."
01:54:05;01:54:06;"I don't know."
01:54:06;01:54:09;"Do people call Tampa Bay ""Tampa Bay,"""
01:54:09;01:54:15;"or is it more like a conceptual, psychological geography?"
01:54:15;01:54:18;"It's like calling the Kennedy administration ""Camelot."""
01:54:18;01:54:20;"You know, I hadn't--"
01:54:20;01:54:24;"I'd never heard of it before,"
01:54:24;01:54:28;"but Tom Brady is actually seeking to trademark Tampa Bay"
01:54:28;01:54:32;"and Tampa Brady per ESPN."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"Tampa Brady?"
01:54:34;01:54:41;"Tom Brady's agents are seeking to trademark Tampa Bay."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"There's merch."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"Yeah, this is a thing."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"It's a phenomenon."
01:54:45;01:54:46;"This is the new wave."
01:54:46;01:54:49;"We've got to trademark the Beatles' subway parties."
01:54:49;01:54:52;"Maybe that's the TC NFTs we're going to drop."
01:54:52;01:54:55;"We get sued by the Beatles and subway?"
01:54:55;01:54:59;"A cool collage of the Beatles with subs in front of them."
01:54:59;01:55:00;"Right."
01:55:00;01:55:04;"We make $40 million in two days,"
01:55:04;01:55:06;"and then the lawsuits start."
01:55:06;01:55:08;"Paul McCartney is not feeling it."
01:55:08;01:55:10;"No peace and love from Ringo."
01:55:10;01:55:12;"Just, ""How dare you?"""
01:55:12;01:55:17;"Fred DeLuca Jr., just irate, coming after us."
01:55:17;01:55:19;"All right, so in two weeks, though,"
01:55:19;01:55:23;"we're going to go deep into not only the Super Bowl ads,"
01:55:23;01:55:25;"but I also want to do some play-by-play analysis"
01:55:25;01:55:31;"of exactly what happened between Tampa Bay and Kansas City."
01:55:31;01:55:33;"Correct? All right."
01:55:33;01:55:37;"So Kansas City, KC Masterpiece."
01:55:37;01:55:38;"Just freestyling here."
01:55:38;01:55:40;"KC Masterpiece versus Tampa Bay."
01:55:40;01:55:42;"We're going to get into granular detail"
01:55:42;01:55:45;"what went down on that fateful day,"
01:55:45;01:55:48;"and we will talk about the ads as well."
01:55:48;01:55:51;"That would be funny if we spent so much time analyzing the game"
01:55:51;01:55:54;"that we still had to push the ads to the next show."
01:55:54;01:55:57;"But also, definitely let's talk about Bob Marley in Delaware,"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"because we had a good thread about that,"
01:55:59;01:56:03;"and that goes deeper than we thought."
01:56:03;01:56:06;"Bob Marley's year in Delaware made an impact on him, his music,"
01:56:06;01:56:09;"and of course on the people of the Wilmington area."
01:56:09;01:56:12;"We should try to find out if Joe Biden ever commented on it."
01:56:12;01:56:14;"Anyway, all that and more in two weeks."
01:56:14;01:56:16;"Great to have you back, Jake."
01:56:16;01:56:18;"See everybody soon."
01:56:18;01:56:19;"Great to be back."
01:56:19;01:56:23;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:56:23;01:56:25;"(siren wailing)"
