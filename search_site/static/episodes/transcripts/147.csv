00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis back again. On this episode we finally go deep on an iconic American chain."
00:08;00:11;"A pizzeria called Domino's."
00:11;00:15;"We talk about its origins, its future, and everything in between."
00:15;00:22;"We avoid the Noid and listen to some great music from Billy Joel, Three Dog Night, and The Jackson 5."
00:22;00:25;"That was Michael Jackson's band. This is..."
00:25;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:17;01:19;"Time Crisis back once again. What's up, Jake?"
01:19;01:21;"Not much. How are you?"
01:21;01:23;"I'm alright. Business as usual."
01:23;01:26;"Typical low energy start to the show."
01:26;01:31;"We'll get in our groove. Don't want to hit them with too much off the top."
01:31;01:35;"Nothing prepped for the top. I never know what to say when you're like, ""What's up, Jake?"""
01:35;01:40;"I'm just like, was cleaning out a paintbrush like five minutes ago."
01:40;01:42;"Just wrapping up work for the day."
01:42;01:45;"Poured myself a Mezcal on the rocks here."
01:45;01:46;"Okay."
01:46;01:48;"I've been working by myself for the last eight hours."
01:48;01:52;"I haven't talked to anyone for a while, so I need to kind of transition."
01:52;01:54;"The first ten minutes of the show might be a little rocky."
01:54;02:00;"I wonder if any TC heads have picked up on this different energy that now that Jake records at his studio,"
02:00;02:08;"we kind of get to witness this full transition from working man into radio personality."
02:08;02:10;"Yeah, it's not a smooth transition."
02:10;02:12;"I don't know. The engine's a little cold right now."
02:12;02:18;"It's going to take a few tries to turn it over or whatever dumb metaphor you want to apply."
02:18;02:22;"So, what's up, guys? Good to see some peeps on the screen."
02:22;02:24;"Good to see some people on FaceTime."
02:24;02:26;"Oh, yeah. Very intimate."
02:26;02:29;"I'm drinking the last Stella Artois that was in my fridge."
02:29;02:31;"Okay. You've been working on those for a second."
02:31;02:35;"I feel like you were drinking that when you were dressed in your British tracksuit."
02:35;02:36;"Exactly."
02:36;02:43;"Well, I guess, you know, we can jump right in because we got some pretty deep stuff to get into today."
02:43;02:47;"The first thing is that Domino's is bringing back the Noid."
02:47;02:57;"That's a sentence that either is immediately filling somebody with joy or dread or truly is so deeply meaningless to the listener."
02:57;03:04;"But I guess before we even talk about the Noid, I don't think we've ever talked too much about Domino's, which is kind of surprising."
03:04;03:06;"Major oversight."
03:06;03:09;"Corporate food history."
03:09;03:13;"Let's talk about it."
03:13;03:17;"I have somewhat warm feelings towards Domino's personally."
03:17;03:20;"I don't know. I feel like my family was like cool with it."
03:20;03:25;"We would order Domino's and I just had a sense of like, I guess Domino's is okay."
03:25;03:29;"Was your family snobby about other like chain fast food places?"
03:29;03:34;"Yeah, I know. Even though she eventually felt like she had to take us."
03:34;03:37;"I know my mom was not psyched about taking us to McDonald's."
03:37;03:41;"That felt like, you know, okay, fine, but this is not cool."
03:41;03:47;"Whereas like Domino's, I don't know. Domino's was just like our local pizza chain."
03:47;03:52;"Like I always felt like I would see commercials for like Little Caesars, Papa John's, that kind of sh*t."
03:52;03:56;"And I would just be like, I have no idea where this is. It looks sick."
03:56;04:02;"Maybe it was just like on the wrong highway strip mall from like where we lived."
04:02;04:06;"So I don't know. I only really felt like I had experience with Domino's."
04:06;04:16;"What were the occasions that would result in your parents choosing Domino's over a local northern New Jersey mom and pop pizzeria?"
04:16;04:19;"That's a great question. I literally was just thinking that."
04:19;04:21;"Because surely you must have patronized those spots as well."
04:21;04:25;"Oh yeah. Vinny's in Bloomfield, New Jersey."
04:25;04:29;"Vinny's. I mean it's like so on the nose."
04:29;04:34;"Just straight up. Seinfeld, can I get a number crunch? Is Vinny's in Bloomfield still open?"
04:34;04:37;"I don't know. Domino's reminds me of Dunkin Donuts."
04:37;04:41;"I guess maybe just because it's two brands that I have slightly warm associations with from childhood."
04:41;04:47;"Where I weirdly think of them as being kind of classy, but I know that's not the majority opinion."
04:47;04:48;"That's weird."
04:48;04:53;"Actually like Pizza Hut seemed harsher to me. Domino's seemed like slightly better pizza."
04:53;04:56;"Although, whatever. I came around to Pizza Hut."
04:56;05:00;"But there's something about Domino's. I don't know. The branding seemed kind of..."
05:00;05:03;"It actually seemed like decent quality ingredients."
05:03;05:08;"But then when you actually go to a Domino's, it reminds me so much of like off-track betting."
05:08;05:13;"Just that kind of weird vibe of like you step in, there's this counter."
05:13;05:16;"It's always kind of dingy in the place where you hang out."
05:16;05:21;"It feels like being at like a little bit like being at Port Authority or something."
05:21;05:26;"Like a bus depot. That same vibe of kind of like, ""We don't want you here. Keep it moving."""
05:26;05:29;"Right. Vinny's is still going strong, by the way."
05:29;05:32;"Vinny's on... Was it on Broad Street?"
05:32;05:33;"Yeah."
05:33;05:34;"They're still in business."
05:34;05:37;"Okay, that's great. Yeah, I thought Vinny's was pretty good."
05:37;05:39;"I mean, what were you hitting, Jake?"
05:39;05:42;"I mean, well, I was going to say Domino's is quick."
05:42;05:49;"Domino's is quick. If you're in a pinch and you need the food there pronto, you go to Domino's."
05:49;05:50;"Domino's."
05:50;05:54;"Seinfeld, quick number crunch, Antonio's in Southbury, Connecticut."
05:54;05:59;"Because that was our spot. We didn't have a chain pizza zone in Southbury."
05:59;06:02;"Are pizzerias basically always somebody's name?"
06:02;06:07;"Well, there was another one called Pizza Villa, who actually sponsored one of the Little League teams."
06:07;06:10;"And I always thought that was cool to play for Pizza Villa."
06:10;06:13;"Yeah. It looks like Antonio's is still going, too."
06:13;06:14;"Cool."
06:14;06:17;"Is this the original Antonio's on East Hill?"
06:17;06:19;"I couldn't tell you the street, but..."
06:19;06:22;"Yeah, the classic pizzeria is somebody's name."
06:22;06:27;"Yeah, like a Mexican restaurant tends to be like..."
06:27;06:31;"I mean, I feel like one of the local places in my part of Jersey was called like Mexicali Rose."
06:31;06:32;"Evocative name."
06:32;06:35;"Evocative. Yeah, Chinese restaurants tend to have..."
06:35;06:39;"Like, they really would name the restaurant like something house."
06:39;06:43;"I love thinking about the choices to name restaurants."
06:43;06:47;"We had a cool Mexican restaurant near our house called Tortilla Flat,"
06:47;06:51;"which is, I believe, a reference to the John Steinbeck novel."
06:51;06:57;"This got me thinking about the naming conventions for Irish pubs."
06:57;07:00;"It's usually a last name, right?"
07:00;07:05;"Yeah. Or isn't it always like the Fox and the Fiddle or the Friar and the..."
07:05;07:07;"Well, that's like... There's a lot of English ones."
07:07;07:11;"I don't know. Irish like that too. The English ones that are like two funny things."
07:11;07:14;"The Cat and the Fiddle, the Something and the Something."
07:14;07:16;"Pizzeria are usually people's names. I mean, well, let's start with..."
07:16;07:18;"Italian Dynasty."
07:18;07:21;"Yeah, right. Yeah, exactly."
07:21;07:22;"Because that's like... There's like a classic..."
07:22;07:26;"A Chinese restaurant could easily be called Hunan Dynasty."
07:26;07:32;"And like, I'm trying to think of just something taken from like Italian history."
07:32;07:35;"Mount Etna. Would there be something like that?"
07:35;07:38;"Like a pizzeria named after a mountain?"
07:38;07:40;"Just like Renaissance pizzeria?"
07:40;07:43;"I mean, Little Caesar is a little bit like that, isn't it?"
07:43;07:45;"Right, but that's when you get into the chain."
07:45;07:49;"I kind of respect Little Caesar as like referencing Roman history."
07:49;07:51;"And they had like a cool mascot."
07:51;07:54;"Yeah, well, what was that mascot called?"
07:54;07:55;"He was Little Caesar."
07:55;07:57;"It's not Little Caesar?"
07:57;07:58;"It's his spot."
07:58;08:01;"Oh, was he Little Caesar? Yeah, I guess that makes sense."
08:26;08:29;"There was a Little Caesar in the Kmart in my town."
08:29;08:30;"Little Caesar's in the Kmart?"
08:30;08:35;"Yeah, Little Caesar's inside the Kmart that my buddies and I would hit a few times in high school."
08:35;08:36;"Oh, boy."
08:36;08:41;"It's like Friday night, like hanging out at like Jared's house."
08:41;08:44;"Let's roll over to Kmart, get some pizza."
08:44;08:47;"Oh, yeah, get some two liters of Mountain Dew."
08:47;08:48;"I didn't drink in high school at all."
08:48;08:51;"So I was like... In fact, one time we went..."
08:51;08:53;"Oh, my God, this is such a random memory."
08:53;08:56;"One time we went to the Little Caesars in the Kmart in my town."
08:56;08:59;"For some reason, we thought it'd be really funny if we like dressed in camo."
08:59;09:03;"Because my friend Jared was like really into like, I don't know, like..."
09:03;09:04;"Military?"
09:04;09:05;"Military."
09:05;09:06;"Technology?"
09:06;09:09;"He wanted to go... My friend Jared, growing up, he wanted to go into like the army."
09:09;09:11;"Okay, he's a classic army dude."
09:11;09:12;"Yeah, he was an army guy."
09:12;09:16;"And he was like... It's so funny because like this is in the 90s."
09:16;09:18;"He was like, ""Yeah, man, I'm a Republican."""
09:18;09:20;"And I was like, ""Okay, cool, whatever that means."""
09:20;09:23;"When you're like 15 or 16 or whatever."
09:23;09:28;"And then he went to this military academy after he graduated high school for like a week."
09:28;09:30;"And then he was like, ""This sucks."""
09:30;09:35;"And like went home, back to Southberry and worked at the Home Depot in Danbury for a year."
09:35;09:36;"And then reapplied to college."
09:36;09:39;"But anyway, we went to the Little Caesars one time."
09:39;09:42;"Dressed in camo because he had like just tons of camo."
09:42;09:44;"Even put like on like camo face paint."
09:44;09:45;"Whoa."
09:45;09:46;"I know, it was really weird."
09:46;09:48;"It was like you're like 16 in like a weird town."
09:48;09:51;"You might end up in jail today if you did that."
09:51;09:52;"No, I know, it'd be weird."
09:52;09:54;"We weren't armed."
09:54;09:55;"So..."
09:55;09:57;"I don't think Connecticut is open care."
09:57;10:01;"We got a local high school militia entering the Kmart."
10:01;10:05;"No, looking back on that now, from our 16-year-old brain..."
10:05;10:06;"It was like terrifying."
10:06;10:07;"Oh yeah, no, absolutely."
10:07;10:14;"From our 16-year-old brain perspective in 1993 or whatever, it was funny to put on camo and face paint."
10:14;10:16;"And like go to like the Kmart and pick up pizza."
10:16;10:18;"Like pick up for Jared."
10:18;10:19;"Right."
10:19;10:24;"And it's interesting to look back on that memory and like it would have a different valence today."
10:24;10:26;"Well, yeah, it's before like..."
10:26;10:27;"School shootings."
10:27;10:31;"Before school shootings, before the Oklahoma City bombing."
10:31;10:32;"Early Clinton years."
10:32;10:34;"I guess it was like a year before that."
10:34;10:40;"It was actually the Clinton years where people really started getting freaked out about this concept of militias."
10:40;10:41;"Right, yeah."
10:41;10:46;"I think for us it was more of like a weird, funny, like art, like punk prank."
10:46;10:47;"Right."
10:47;10:54;"Today, you would have been like suspended from school for three months and people would be asking like, ""Who radicalized Jake?"""
10:54;10:59;"You'd just be like, ""It was a punk prank and we just wanted to get some Little Caesars."""
10:59;11:03;"Oh my God."
11:03;11:05;"Yeah, it would have been like on the internet."
11:05;11:07;"There would have been like dumb like footage."
11:07;11:09;"That would have gone very sideways."
11:09;11:15;"Look at these radicalized teens in Connecticut going like in the Kmart wearing camo and be like, ""Wait, what?"""
11:15;11:17;"You're like, ""We weren't armed, man."""
11:17;11:19;"It's so weird to think about that."
11:19;11:22;"That was such a good deep memory I just pulled out."
11:22;11:26;"Maybe one day, because we were texting earlier, you're working on some new brews."
11:26;11:34;"Maybe one day there'll be a brews EP that's truly like just, it's your kind of like in remembrance of things past."
11:34;11:37;"Just like looking back at childhood memories."
11:37;11:41;"There'll be one camo in the Kmart about that memory."
11:41;11:42;"Oh, that's good."
11:42;11:46;"We wore camo in the Kmart."
11:46;11:54;"Yeah, because we would try to remake Rambo using his dad's VHS camcorder."
11:54;11:59;"Just try to film action sequences and stuff in the woods."
11:59;12:08;"That reminds me, very early, I wonder what grade you first would even be encouraged to write a story."
12:08;12:10;"Like second grade maybe?"
12:10;12:11;"Yeah, something."
12:11;12:19;"I can really picture that like big fat paper they would give you that would be like two solid lines with like a perforated one in the middle."
12:19;12:24;"Where you're kind of trying to learn how to do cursive by learning the upper half and the bottom half."
12:24;12:28;"So, I have some memory of being told we had to write stories."
12:28;12:29;"Yeah, I feel like second grade."
12:29;12:31;"So, you know, handwriting's still pretty f***ed."
12:31;12:41;"And I have this memory of already, you know, experiencing how compromised art can be once it leaves your head and you're thinking about an audience."
12:41;12:46;"That I feel like I was writing some kooky story that felt kind of like me."
12:46;12:55;"And I don't know why, because I was so not into any of this stuff, I felt like I needed to write a kind of like boyish story."
12:55;12:57;"And I wrote a story called ""Army Guys""."
12:57;13:02;"And I just remember just like knowing absolutely nothing about the military."
13:02;13:10;"Being mostly uninterested in it, it had a bit of an allure because like nobody in my life would like let me get toy guns or even like military stuff."
13:10;13:17;"I have a memory of like being at a store with my grandpa and you know, like a supermarket in the Bronx and him being like, ""You want to get a coloring book?"""
13:17;13:18;"And I was like, ""Yeah."""
13:18;13:21;"And I kind of went for like this G.I. Joe and he was like, ""Not that one."""
13:21;13:24;"I was like, ""Come on, man. Please."""
13:24;13:27;"- Oh, your grandpa was shutting down the G.I. Joe?"
13:27;13:29;"- Wow. I wonder what his perspective was."
13:29;13:32;"That grandfather, I think he was in the Navy."
13:32;13:36;"He did some, obviously like everybody that generation, he did something in World War II."
13:36;13:38;"He might've just been like, seems violent."
13:38;13:44;"I don't think he was on some like deep like pacifist thing necessarily."
13:44;13:46;"I think he probably just looked at that and was like, ""What are all these guns?"""
13:46;13:47;"You know, it seems violent."
13:47;13:48;"- Mm-hmm."
13:48;13:51;"- Or maybe he was a Cobra sympathizer."
13:51;13:54;"Maybe he'd been radicalized to the Cobra side."
13:54;14:01;"- Did you feel like a pressure to like write like a masculine, like male story?"
14:01;14:02;"- I think so."
14:02;14:06;"I think I had a feeling like, ""Oh, that's like, there's something cool about that."""
14:06;14:08;"But I knew my heart wasn't quite in it."
14:08;14:12;"But yeah, like what the f*ck would I have known about the military?"
14:12;14:18;"And I'm sure it was like some very vague, like the army guys are on a mission"
14:18;14:22;"and they're climbing up a hill."
14:22;14:24;"Oh no, one of the army guys got lost."
14:24;14:26;"I'm sure it was like totally meaningless."
14:26;14:32;"But yeah, those are like the kind of symbols that like loomed large in childhood."
14:32;14:35;"Maybe because of just like stuff like GI Joe or going over to some kid's house."
14:35;14:38;"He's got like all these like crazy guns."
14:38;14:44;"And you know, that's such like a classic boy toy or like those little green army dudes"
14:44;14:46;"where their feet are on a platform."
14:46;14:47;"- Yeah."
14:47;14:51;"- So probably just having some sense of like, ""Oh yeah, this is like an important thing,"""
14:51;14:54;"but probably having zero context for it."
14:54;14:57;"- I mean, it goes to show, man, you're growing up in a militaristic empire."
14:57;14:59;"- Yeah, who knows what I... I don't know."
15:05;15:07;"What he sayin', ""You know this up"""
15:07;15:08;"I'm the twins, geeked and stuff"
15:08;15:10;"I'm in the Benz, pushin' the pedal"
15:10;15:12;"New FN, ain't no metal"
15:12;15:13;"Pray for sins, I might move wrong"
15:13;15:15;"Brought them tens, hand in clouds"
15:15;15:16;"Then the b***h that I saw in the crowd"
15:16;15:18;"Told her shut up, she screamin' too loud"
15:18;15:21;"I told you so, get mad I've told"
15:21;15:23;"Big AK's like GI Joe"
15:23;15:24;"V-Fake like CGI"
15:24;15:26;"West Coast like TDE"
15:26;15:28;"Tell that s***o you ain't know"
15:28;15:30;"Asked 'bout Boat, no hint, he don't go"
15:30;15:32;"Point and false, and a bottle 'bout four or five benzes"
15:32;15:34;"I got a tent, I crash to back"
15:34;15:36;"I got the b***h in the back, getting bent"
15:36;15:37;"I saw it in the back of the crib in the tent"
15:37;15:40;"Slap, I got a four pack"
15:40;15:42;"I had to fold the Mac"
15:42;15:43;"Droppin' the s*** off the track"
15:43;15:45;"Yeah, I moved them boys live"
15:45;15:47;"Fear I might n***a too big in the five"
15:47;15:49;"Jump in that water and first I dive"
15:49;15:51;"I have such a good transition"
15:51;15:53;"from our Little Caesars to our Domino talk"
15:53;15:54;"Back to Domino's"
15:54;15:59;"that in 1992, I mean, this feels so TC"
15:59;16:03;"the owners of Little Caesars bought the Detroit Tigers"
16:03;16:05;"the baseball team"
16:05;16:08;"from the owner of Domino's"
16:08;16:09;"Whoa"
16:09;16:10;"That rules"
16:10;16:11;"Deep"
16:11;16:12;"And I think there's still"
16:12;16:14;"Is Little Caesars Michigan based?"
16:14;16:17;"I'm pretty sure there's a Little Caesars arena in Detroit"
16:17;16:19;"Is that where the Pistons play?"
16:19;16:22;"Okay, so yeah, they're major out there"
16:22;16:24;"I think Little Caesars was founded in Detroit"
16:24;16:28;"and they're still headquartered in Detroit"
16:28;16:32;"That's crazy that two huge Visa chains are coming out of Michigan"
16:32;16:34;"Shout out to Michigan"
16:34;16:36;"Alright, so back to Domino's"
16:36;16:38;"So what's the story? Why is it even called Domino's?"
16:38;16:41;"It's funny, all of these, the ones"
16:41;16:44;"All of the really big chains"
16:44;16:47;"I guess kind of seem like they were built to be chains"
16:47;16:49;"Although I guess Papa John's"
16:49;16:51;"if you really take a step back"
16:51;16:52;"that kind of just sounds like a local dude"
16:52;16:54;"Like, ""Oh yeah, Papa John"""
16:54;16:55;"He's an older Italian man"
16:55;16:57;"He opened it in the 50s"
16:57;16:59;"It's family business"
16:59;17:02;"But Domino's just sounds like"
17:02;17:04;"It has a little bit of that Einstein Brothers energy"
17:04;17:05;"where you're kind of like"
17:05;17:07;"a bunch of people put their heads together and were like"
17:07;17:09;"""Guys, people love pizza"
17:09;17:13;"but you're never going to go national with Antonios or Vinnie's"""
17:13;17:16;"Let's pull something that feels fun"
17:16;17:18;"maybe doesn't feel too Italian"
17:18;17:20;"and like somebody's like, ""What about like Domino?"""
17:20;17:22;"A lot of different people like to play Domino's"
17:22;17:24;"and you're like, ""Yeah, sure, it's a good symbol"""
17:24;17:26;"But does anybody have the actual story?"
17:26;17:29;"Yeah, it was originally called Dominic's Restaurant"
17:29;17:31;"Oh, okay"
17:31;17:32;"when it was purchased"
17:32;17:34;"and it seems like it was a little contentious"
17:34;17:37;"because when they expanded"
17:37;17:39;"they wanted to keep the same branding"
17:39;17:43;"but the original owner did not let them keep Dominic's"
17:43;17:43;"so they"
17:43;17:46;"an employee of the restaurant"
17:46;17:47;"suggested Domino's"
17:47;17:49;"That person probably did not get any royalties"
17:49;17:51;"But the people who took over from"
17:51;17:54;"who took over Dominic's were Tom"
17:54;17:56;"Monaghan and his brother"
17:56;18:00;"and the little fun thing I'm reading here is that"
18:00;18:03;"one of the brothers didn't want to split the work evenly"
18:03;18:08;"because he didn't want to quit his full-time postman job"
18:08;18:11;"So he wasn't as gung-ho"
18:11;18:11;"He wasn't going to"
18:11;18:13;"He was dipping his toe in the water"
18:13;18:18;"But he was like, ""I'm not going to quit my postman job"""
18:18;18:20;"Wow, so Monaghan's an Irish name, right?"
18:20;18:21;"It sounds like a pub"
18:21;18:22;"Kind of"
18:22;18:24;"Is this a little bit of a reverse McDonald's?"
18:24;18:27;"Like with two brothers"
18:27;18:29;"purchasing someone's restaurant"
18:29;18:31;"like instead of Ray Kroc"
18:31;18:33;"and keeping the name"
18:33;18:34;"Yeah, they actually changed the name"
18:34;18:37;"So this sounds also like a story where"
18:37;18:38;"the"
18:38;18:40;"people kind of just got lucky because"
18:40;18:43;"I'm picturing these two Irish brothers"
18:43;18:44;"who are just like, ""Alright"
18:44;18:48;"we bought out this old Italian dude Dominic's"
18:48;18:50;"and now we're going to be Dominic"""
18:50;18:52;"Nobody would ever take us seriously"
18:52;18:53;"a couple Irish dudes"
18:53;18:54;"selling pizza"
18:54;18:56;"but we have this amazing IP"
18:56;18:58;"Dominic"
18:58;18:59;"Then Dominic's like, ""No, no, no, no"
18:59;19:00;"You can't have my IP"
19:00;19:01;"You can't call it Dominic's"""
19:01;19:03;"And they're just like, ""F***"
19:03;19:04;"We love the name"""
19:04;19:05;"But then deep down"
19:05;19:07;"Can you imagine there being"
19:07;19:10;"America just having like, you know"
19:10;19:13;"25,000 pizza chains called Dominic's?"
19:13;19:15;"It's like the fact that it's called Domino's"
19:15;19:17;"is what separates it from"
19:17;19:20;"the local Italian"
19:20;19:21;"mom and pop spot"
19:21;19:24;"Just imagine that you're like Dominic's family"
19:24;19:27;"and he probably sold it for a little bit of money"
19:27;19:29;"and then they don't even keep his name"
19:29;19:30;"and it's just like"
19:30;19:32;"it's almost like insult to injury"
19:32;19:34;"that they're just like, ""Alright, fine"
19:34;19:36;"What's a word that vaguely starts"
19:36;19:37;"sounds like your-"
19:37;19:38;"It's just like so random"
19:38;19:38;"Domino"""
19:38;19:40;"I think of the Van Morrison song"
19:40;19:41;"Oh yeah"
19:41;19:42;"Domino"
19:42;19:46;"Don't wanna discuss it"
19:46;19:50;"Think it's time for a change"
19:50;19:54;"You make it disgusting"
19:54;19:57;"Besides thinking that I'm strange"
19:57;20:01;"In case I go underground"
20:01;20:04;"Get some heavy rest"
20:04;20:08;"Never have to worry"
20:08;20:09;"About what is worse"
20:09;20:10;"Or what is best"
20:10;20:11;"Do it"
20:11;20:13;"Oh"
20:13;20:14;"Domino"
20:14;20:15;"Alright"
20:15;20:16;"Don't be a wimp"
20:16;20:17;"Don't be a"
20:17;20:20;"There you go"
20:20;20:22;"Lord have mercy"
20:22;20:24;"I said, ""Oh"
20:24;20:26;"Domino"""
20:26;20:27;"Don't be a wimp"
20:27;20:28;"Don't be a"
20:28;20:31;"There you go"
20:31;20:33;"Say it again"
20:33;20:37;"I said, ""Oh"
20:37;20:38;"Domino"""
20:38;20:41;"Alright, so now two Irish brothers"
20:41;20:42;"have this"
20:42;20:44;"random name"
20:44;20:46;"named pizzeria Domino's"
20:46;20:48;"and I guess just little by little"
20:48;20:50;"they turn into an empire"
20:50;20:51;"Yeah"
20:51;20:51;"It's interesting"
20:51;20:54;"Purchased by Bain Capital in '88"
20:54;20:56;"Again? Bain Capital?"
20:56;20:57;"As you do, man"
20:57;20:58;"Always"
20:58;21:00;"The company logo originally had three dots"
21:00;21:04;"representing the three original stores in 1965"
21:04;21:06;"Monaghan planned to add a new dot"
21:06;21:09;"with the addition of every new store"
21:09;21:10;"but this idea quickly faded"
21:10;21:12;"as Domino's experienced rapid growth"
21:12;21:16;"Okay"
21:16;21:17;"Like"
21:17;21:18;"17,000 dots?"
21:18;21:20;"It's just like"
21:20;21:22;"It's very abstract"
21:22;21:23;"What was their goal gonna be?"
21:23;21:24;"Like they thought like"
21:24;21:26;"""Oh, we won't have more than, what?"
21:26;21:28;"Nine stores?"""
21:28;21:30;"It's like the American flag"
21:30;21:31;"If they turn DC into a state"
21:31;21:32;"what are you gonna do?"
21:32;21:33;"You're gonna"
21:33;21:34;"Right"
21:34;21:36;"51 stars on the flag"
21:36;21:39;"I wonder if they ever went out to Van Morrison for"
21:39;21:41;"to see if they could secure that song for an ad"
21:41;21:43;"Oh, it'd be perfect"
21:43;21:46;"I mean, if he like re-sang it in like 1991"
21:46;21:47;"And just said Domino's"
21:47;21:48;"instead of"
21:48;21:49;"Cause I think it's like"
21:49;21:50;"Domino"
21:50;21:52;"Yeah, it's singular in the song"
21:52;21:53;"But if you change it to"
21:53;21:54;"Domino's"
21:54;21:57;"Yeah, I really have no idea where Domino falls"
21:57;21:58;"Cause this says"
21:58;22:00;"In a 2009 survey of"
22:00;22:02;"consumer taste preferences among national chains"
22:02;22:04;"by brand keys"
22:04;22:05;"Domino's"
22:05;22:07;"tied for last place"
22:07;22:09;"along with Chuck E. Cheese"
22:09;22:11;"Now that's crazy"
22:11;22:14;"Friend of the show, Chuck E. Cheese"
22:14;22:17;"I didn't think Domino's was like down there"
22:17;22:19;"Yeah, I think it has a pretty bad reputation"
22:19;22:22;"Wait, so is Papa John's considered classier than Domino's?"
22:22;22:23;"I think so"
22:23;22:24;"I mean"
22:24;22:24;"Really?"
22:24;22:26;"Before Papa John Schnatter"
22:26;22:28;"like kind of trashes"
22:28;22:30;"his reputation within sort of like"
22:30;22:32;"liberal circles"
22:32;22:36;"Like if you asked someone in like 2006"
22:36;22:37;"of the major three chains"
22:37;22:40;"Pizza Hut, Papa John's and Domino's"
22:40;22:41;"who has the best pizza"
22:41;22:46;"I think you'd get a vast majority of people saying Papa John's"
22:46;22:47;"Now I don't think that's the case anymore"
22:47;22:50;"because politics now consumes everything"
22:50;22:51;"Right"
22:51;22:52;"I think Papa John's"
22:52;22:54;"because of the garlic sauce cup"
22:54;22:57;"and because they were slightly like a newer brand"
22:57;22:58;"Okay"
22:58;23:00;"Had like a better reputation"
23:00;23:01;"15, 20 years ago"
23:01;23:04;"And Domino's is basically just considered trash?"
23:04;23:04;"Yeah, I think so"
23:04;23:07;"I think you have a weird perception of it"
23:07;23:10;"I mean, I never thought it was like great"
23:10;23:11;"but I thought it, you know, it's like fine"
23:11;23:12;"Here's the thing"
23:12;23:14;"I mean, I worked for Domino's"
23:14;23:15;"and I worked for Papa John's"
23:15;23:18;"and I've eaten Pizza Hut a fair amount in my life"
23:18;23:19;"and it's all the same stuff"
23:19;23:23;"It doesn't, you know, there's a few like slight variations"
23:23;23:25;"like the garlic sauce cup or whatever"
23:25;23:25;"Yeah"
23:25;23:28;"But like it's all coming from the same"
23:28;23:30;"you know, offsite sort of like"
23:30;23:33;"Right, Pizza Hut feels more like unique"
23:33;23:36;"It's that kind of strange deep dish"
23:36;23:39;"almost like fried flavor"
23:39;23:41;"They put mayonnaise in the pan"
23:41;23:42;"At Pizza Hut?"
23:42;23:44;"And that's what gives it"
23:44;23:45;"its special crust"
23:45;23:46;"I don't buy that"
23:46;23:47;"It's true"
23:47;23:47;"I'm gonna look at it"
23:47;23:48;"I'm gonna number crunch this"
23:48;23:49;"but that's true"
23:49;23:50;"That's why the crust tastes different"
23:50;23:54;"Pizza Hut has that special mayonnaise crust"
23:54;23:56;"Wait, I think they probably put some sort of like"
23:56;23:58;"margarine based like"
23:58;24:01;"greasing product up like in the pan"
24:01;24:03;"but I don't think it's mayonnaise"
24:03;24:06;"To give it that special fried cake feel"
24:06;24:09;"Does Pizza Hut have a significant delivery business"
24:09;24:11;"or they were just always about eating, dining?"
24:11;24:13;"Oh no, Hut has serious delivery"
24:13;24:17;"Yeah, maybe it's just a quirk of the street I grew up on"
24:17;24:17;"Yeah"
24:17;24:21;"We didn't have Pizza Hut anywhere nearby"
24:21;24:23;"and just couldn't get delivered"
24:23;24:24;"Okay, so sounds like"
24:24;24:28;"after that really abysmal survey in 2009"
24:28;24:31;"they announced plans to entirely reinvent pizza"
24:31;24:33;"which included a self-critical ad campaign"
24:33;24:36;"in which consumers were filmed criticizing the pizza's quality"
24:36;24:38;"Chefs were then shown developing a new pizza"
24:38;24:41;"then they hired J. Patrick Doyle as their new CEO"
24:41;24:45;"and experienced a 14.3% quarterly gain"
24:45;24:48;"Okay, so maybe the new Domino's has only been"
24:48;24:50;"roughly the past 10 years"
24:50;24:51;"Then I've started hearing"
24:51;24:52;"Oh, people really, you know"
24:52;24:54;"Wall Street really likes Domino's stock"
24:54;24:58;"because they're investing in all this new tech"
24:58;25:00;"That's actually something that Bayo has said to me over the years"
25:00;25:03;"that Domino's is considered almost a tech company"
25:03;25:06;"because they put so much money into their software"
25:06;25:08;"and their delivery systems"
25:08;25:10;"and they're going to be building oven cars"
25:10;25:13;"and all sorts of crazy stuff"
25:13;25:15;"Actually, I was just reading about this"
25:15;25:16;"Oven car?"
25:16;25:16;"Three weeks ago"
25:16;25:20;"So yeah, they had an oven car they released in 2015"
25:20;25:21;"that was like"
25:21;25:23;"it has a built-in oven"
25:23;25:26;"but I don't think they rolled it out like super wide"
25:26;25:29;"but I was just reading that three weeks ago"
25:29;25:32;"Domino's launched an autonomous pizza delivery"
25:32;25:34;"robot car in Houston"
25:34;25:38;"Customers can choose to have their meal delivered by an R2 robot"
25:38;25:41;"It's the first completely autonomous on-road delivery vehicle"
25:41;25:44;"approved by the US Department of Transportation"
25:44;25:46;"All right, Domino's fortunes have really turned"
25:46;25:48;"But so this pizza car"
25:48;25:50;"it pulls up to your house or your apartment building"
25:50;25:54;"and then you got to just walk outside and meet it?"
25:54;25:57;"There's a picture of a person walking to the car"
25:57;26:01;"and there's like some sort of like hole in the car"
26:01;26:03;"Maybe it's a push"
26:03;26:04;"Is this like RoboCop?"
26:04;26:07;"Mr. Koenig"
26:07;26:09;"You ordered two large, two topping"
26:09;26:11;"pepperoni, green pepper"
26:11;26:14;"pepperoni, black olive"
26:14;26:17;"It looks like you push a button and then the thing opens"
26:17;26:18;"and your pizza is inside"
26:18;26:19;"You take it out"
26:19;26:28;"No, this is too much, man"
26:28;26:29;"It's too intense"
26:29;26:30;"Too harsh"
26:30;26:32;"I want to just go to Antonio's, man"
26:32;26:34;"I just want to see a dude"
26:34;26:36;"throwing that crust up into the air"
26:36;26:37;"Yep"
26:37;26:39;"Dollop some of that red sauce on with a ladle"
26:39;26:40;"spread it around"
26:40;26:41;"Boom"
26:41;26:42;"Brutal"
26:42;26:46;"Have you guys used the Domino's app like ever?"
26:46;26:49;"No, but I imagine that must be part of their tech or something"
26:49;26:51;"Oh yeah, well, when you talked about tech"
26:51;26:54;"I was like, oh yeah, their app is pretty advanced"
26:54;26:57;"Like they really do keep you updated every step of the way"
26:57;26:59;"It's like there's a little loading bar"
26:59;27:01;"and it's like making the throwing it up"
27:01;27:02;"Now it's in the oven"
27:02;27:05;"Like you can get like text notifications as well"
27:05;27:09;"Like you get really kept up to date with that app"
27:09;27:10;"That's so cool, dude"
27:10;27:13;"Like, oh wow, my pizza's in the oven"
27:13;27:15;"That's so cool that I know that"
27:15;27:16;"Maybe there's something about that app"
27:16;27:19;"but we don't understand because we're not tech guys"
27:19;27:22;"There's something about like the"
27:22;27:24;"how quickly the information moves"
27:24;27:25;"or some algorithm that they crack"
27:25;27:27;"that actually is like incredibly useful"
27:27;27:29;"and maybe they're selling that code"
27:29;27:32;"or like some version of it to like all sorts of other"
27:32;27:35;"Yeah, maybe to the Pentagon"
27:35;27:38;"Domino's is licensing their code to the NSA"
27:38;27:41;"Who knows, like maybe they're at some conference"
27:41;27:44;"and yes, maybe like a hospital network"
27:44;27:46;"finds that actually that tech is very valuable"
27:46;27:48;"for their patients"
27:48;27:50;"I mean, I guess stuff like that happens"
27:50;27:52;"But yeah, I'm pretty sure there was a quote"
27:52;27:53;"from the Domino's CEO a while back"
27:53;27:57;"that's like, man, pizza is like the last thing on my mind"
27:57;27:58;"We're a tech company"
27:58;28:02;"And I guess it's paying off"
28:03;28:04;"Just like"
28:04;28:06;"So funny"
28:06;28:11;"Pizza's the last thing on my mind"
28:11;28:14;"Just one day Domino's Pizza Tech"
28:14;28:19;"is being used in like the drone war with China"
28:19;28:22;"and just like some sort of like guided missile system"
28:22;28:24;"One day people write that it has its roots"
28:24;28:26;"in Domino's technology"
28:26;28:28;"You just think about Dominic"
28:28;28:33;"Just like, did this guy even, could he ever have guessed?"
28:33;28:35;"Dominic probably never even could have guessed"
28:35;28:39;"that one day there'd be this weird chain called Domino's"
28:39;28:42;"that just like dotted the whole world"
28:42;28:43;"And then just you go one step further"
28:43;28:46;"and you're just like, oh, that's not all Dominic"
28:46;28:48;"It actually became a tech company"
28:48;28:50;"He just like, what's that?"
28:50;28:53;"And this is like, Dominic this little"
28:53;28:56;"I wonder what Dominic's story was"
28:56;28:58;"Was he an immigrant from Italy?"
28:58;28:58;"- I'll tell you, first of all,"
28:58;29:01;"like if we're thinking about like the economics of it"
29:01;29:06;"the deal was secured by a $500 down payment in 1960"
29:06;29:10;"and the company is now valued at $4.1 billion"
29:10;29:13;"- Oh no, I hate that"
29:13;29:18;"- Yeah, as far as who that was, his name was Dominic DeVarti"
29:18;29:21;"and huh, it's like one of those things"
29:21;29:25;"Yeah, I'm not seeing a lot of information about him"
29:25;29:26;"to be honest with you"
29:26;29:28;"His Wikipedia doesn't have like the blue"
29:28;29:30;"like highlighting under his name"
29:30;29:32;"and Google isn't really"
29:32;29:36;"- Domino's is gunning to become the fourth"
29:36;29:38;"'cause right now there's the big three of tech"
29:38;29:40;"Google, Apple and Facebook"
29:40;29:45;"Domino's is just almost there to turn into the big four"
29:45;29:47;"- We got his obituary by the way"
29:47;29:51;"He passed away in 2001, but he's from Jersey city"
29:52;29:56;"Born in 1923, graduated from University of Michigan"
29:56;30:00;"ran for mayor of Ann Arbor in 1957, but was defeated"
30:00;30:04;"and served in the army air corps during World War II"
30:04;30:07;"- Okay, so maybe it's full, it came full circle"
30:07;30:11;"that his pizzeria started to create military technology."
30:11;30:13;"I hate to hear the story about the dude"
30:13;30:15;"who sold something for 500 bucks"
30:15;30:16;"and then it's worth billions."
30:16;30:19;"But when I do take a step back,"
30:19;30:21;"it does kind of seem like"
30:21;30:23;"if you bought somebody's pizzeria"
30:23;30:25;"and they don't even let you keep the name,"
30:25;30:27;"what did you actually buy?"
30:27;30:29;"You bought like a building, he didn't invent pizza"
30:29;30:30;"- You bought the oven"
30:30;30:31;"- Yeah, you bought a building oven"
30:31;30:33;"- You really were just buying the oven"
30:33;30:35;"- And I guess if people hate Domino's so much,"
30:35;30:37;"it's not even like you bought a secret recipe."
30:37;30:41;"This is almost like if somebody bought your old car"
30:41;30:43;"and then they made like a movie"
30:43;30:45;"where they did a road trip with a car"
30:45;30:47;"and the movie, you know, made $200 million."
30:47;30:49;"I mean, what could you really say?"
30:49;30:50;"All right, yeah, you bought my car."
30:50;30:51;"You did your thing with it."
30:51;30:54;"- I feel like if there is a McDonald's style,"
30:54;30:57;"like a founder style movie about the Domino's story,"
30:57;30:59;"there'd be such an incredible scene"
30:59;31:01;"about like the name issue"
31:01;31:03;"and like the sort of defiant,"
31:03;31:05;"like, oh, we don't even need your name, you know?"
31:05;31:09;"Like, I feel like it would be a real major plot point."
31:09;31:11;"- You can't take my name."
31:11;31:13;"The Monaghan brothers put their heads together."
31:13;31:16;"They're like, you know what, Dominic, (beep) you."

31:27;31:28;"when you think about it."
31:28;31:30;"Domino's is a super random company,"
31:30;31:33;"not particularly beloved pizza."
31:33;31:34;"It's kind of just like--"
31:34;31:35;"- Get 'er done."
31:35;31:37;"- I mean, it's almost like Pepsi in a sense,"
31:37;31:41;"although I don't think they serve Pepsi at Domino's,"
31:41;31:44;"but I just feel like Pepsi is,"
31:44;31:45;"you sometimes get this impression"
31:45;31:48;"that it's just a hardworking company"
31:48;31:51;"that carved out a niche for itself."
31:51;31:55;"It's not America's favorite, but it did its thing."
31:55;31:56;"And it's like, still here."

32:49;32:50;"maybe after the Bain Capital purchase"
32:50;32:54;"is when Domino's became kind of like this real powerhouse."
32:54;32:55;"Now we've laid the groundwork,"
32:55;32:58;"we understand what Domino's is,"
32:58;33:00;"now we can talk about the Noid."
33:00;33:02;"The Noid is returning to Domino's advertising"
33:02;33:05;"to help promote its testing of driverless cars"
33:05;33:06;"meant to streamline pizza delivery."
33:06;33:09;"Okay, this is what Kate Trumbull,"
33:09;33:12;"Domino's vice president of advertising said in a statement."
33:12;33:16;"The Noid is Domino's oldest and most famous villain."
33:16;33:21;"How many villains does Domino's have?"
33:21;33:23;"She's talking about it like it's Greek mythology."
33:23;33:26;"Like there's all these characters in the Domino's universe"
33:26;33:30;"and of course we have, or it's like the Batman universe"
33:30;33:31;"where they're basically saying like, you know,"
33:31;33:34;"of course you've got the Riddler and you've got Bain,"
33:34;33:36;"but there's only one Joker"
33:36;33:39;"and he's coming back in the new movie."
33:39;33:41;"But anyway, the Noid is Domino's oldest"
33:41;33:44;"and most famous villain, name me one other villain,"
33:44;33:46;"and the pizza delivery testing we're doing"
33:46;33:48;"with Neuro's autonomous vehicles"
33:48;33:50;"is exactly the kind of technology and innovation"
33:50;33:53;"that could provoke the Noid to return."
33:53;33:55;"However, after 35 years of practice in avoiding the Noid,"
33:55;33:58;"we're pretty confident we know how to defeat it."
33:58;34:03;"So, okay, the Noid was created in 1986 by Group 243,"
34:03;34:06;"the advertising agency for Domino's Pizza."
34:06;34:09;"They made these commercials with this creature."
34:09;34:12;"He was like a humanoid dude wearing red"
34:12;34:14;"and the slogan was ""Avoid the Noid."""
34:14;34:16;"He was named after the employee's nickname"
34:16;34:19;"of Dominoids in advertisements."
34:19;34:21;"The Noid would attempt to delay the delivery of pizzas"
34:21;34:24;"who at the time guaranteed delivery in under 30 minutes"
34:24;34:25;"or the pizza was free."
34:25;34:27;"So I guess that's also worth saying."
34:27;34:29;"A huge part of Domino's marketing"
34:29;34:31;"was about the fact that it would get there quick."
34:31;34:32;"And I feel like back in the day"
34:32;34:34;"there were always so many jokes about like,"
34:34;34:37;"that would be like a common thing in like movies"
34:37;34:39;"where like some kids would order pizza"
34:39;34:41;"and just be like, ""That was 31 minutes."""
34:41;34:44;"And the pizza guy's like, ""Come on, man."""
34:44;34:45;"That really caught people's imagination,"
34:45;34:47;"this idea of 30 minutes or less."
34:47;34:51;"So I guess by creating a villain,"
34:51;34:52;"they were getting people to really believe"
34:52;34:54;"in the 30 minutes or less concept"
34:54;34:59;"and almost root for the person to get there in 30 minutes."
34:59;35:01;"It's almost like gambling a little bit"
35:01;35:03;"where people probably felt like,"
35:03;35:04;"""(beep) Little Caesars taste way better,"
35:04;35:07;"""but Domino's, I don't know, might get that free pizza."""
35:07;35:11;"- I just wonder like how rigid those rules were."
35:11;35:13;"I mean, they must've been like,"
35:13;35:15;"they must've had very specific delivery areas"
35:15;35:18;"'cause 30 minutes is fast."
35:18;35:21;"I mean, if you're slammed on like on a Friday night,"
35:21;35:23;"that's not happening."
35:23;35:24;"Even if you're like around the corner."
35:24;35:25;"- Well, I guess that's why--"
35:25;35:27;"- There must've been like intense stipulations"
35:27;35:28;"with that agreement."
35:28;35:30;"- They probably had some kind of super computer already"
35:30;35:33;"to know exactly how many pizzas to have in the oven"
35:33;35:35;"to keep it coming quick."
35:35;35:37;"Yeah, actually, that raises a great question"
35:37;35:41;"is like how did that actually play out in practice?"
35:41;35:43;"You must've had so many tense situations"
35:43;35:47;"where there's just like a delivery person by themselves"
35:47;35:50;"in some weird part of town and they come to the door"
35:50;35:51;"and the person is just like--"
35:51;35:53;"- 34 minutes, dude."
35:53;35:54;"- Yeah, just like some nut is like,"
35:54;35:58;"""Oh, nice try, you didn't make it in 30."""
35:58;36:00;"And the guy's like, ""Well, I have the receipt right here."
36:00;36:03;"""I actually made it in 20."""
36:03;36:06;"And the guy's like, ""No, sir, no, you didn't."""
36:06;36:08;"And the guy's like, ""I can't give you the pizza, sir."""
36:08;36:10;"And he's like yanks it out of his hands."
36:10;36:12;"That must've happened so much."
36:12;36:15;"Well, actually, so Jake, you did deliver for Domino's,"
36:15;36:17;"which hasn't been discussed much on the show."
36:17;36:20;"We've talked many times about your tenure with Papa John's."
36:20;36:24;"Were you engaging in any of this 30 minutes or less stuff?"
36:24;36:26;"- No, I think this was,"
36:26;36:28;"I wanna say this was the year 2000."
36:28;36:30;"And I think at that point,"
36:30;36:34;"the 30 minutes or less was like ancient mythology."
36:34;36:36;"- They eliminated it in the '90s."
36:36;36:37;"This is pretty crazy. - There'd been too much"
36:37;36:38;"death and destruction?"
36:38;36:41;"- Yeah, according to-- - It's an impossible standard."
36:41;36:43;"- It was tearing the country apart."
36:43;36:48;"- 1993 lawsuit basically alleged that this policy"
36:48;36:51;"had caused over 20 fatalities in the '80s."
36:51;36:52;"- Oh my God. - What the hell?"
36:52;36:54;"- Dozens of accidents."
36:54;36:56;"- Oh, just 'cause the delivery people were so stressed,"
36:56;36:57;"they're just driving like crazy?"
36:57;37:00;"- Yeah, and then what ended the guarantee"
37:00;37:05;"was that a St. Louis woman sued Domino's"
37:05;37:08;"and won a $78 million verdict."
37:08;37:11;"- Whoa. - She was hit in 1989"
37:11;37:13;"by a Domino's driver."
37:13;37:15;"- God. - And was awarded"
37:15;37:17;"almost $79 million."
37:17;37:20;"- Jeez, just 'cause they were trying to get there in 30."
37:20;37:21;"- Yeah. - I also wonder,"
37:21;37:23;"this is probably impossible to research."
37:23;37:26;"If anybody's listening who delivered for Domino's"
37:26;37:27;"in the 30 minutes or less era,"
37:27;37:29;"we'd love to hear your war stories."
37:29;37:31;"Please contact us."
37:31;37:33;"'Cause I also just wonder how it worked."
37:33;37:35;"If the delivery people were so stressed"
37:35;37:39;"that they were just driving like crazy to get there,"
37:39;37:42;"does that mean it came out of their salary or something?"
37:42;37:42;"You think it was something harsh like that?"
37:42;37:46;"- No way, no way, that's insane."
37:46;37:51;"It just goes to show, if you put people in a situation,"
37:51;37:53;"they're like hamsters on a wheel."
37:53;37:56;"Why would the driver really care"
37:56;37:58;"if it's like 35 minutes as opposed to 30?"
37:58;38:00;"- Maybe it affected their income somehow."
38:00;38:02;"Well, they certainly wouldn't get a tip."
38:02;38:03;"- They were not charged."
38:03;38:05;"The drivers would not be charged if they were late."
38:05;38:07;"So it really, that is interesting."
38:07;38:12;"I mean, that kind of employer loyalty feels incredible."
38:12;38:15;"- Yeah, I'm sure the manager was like, ""Go, go on, go."""
38:15;38:19;"The manager's getting heat from the regional manager."
38:19;38:20;"- Well, at the very-- - And it's like,"
38:20;38:21;"""We gotta get those delivery times down."
38:21;38:23;"Come on, guys, haul balls."""
38:23;38:26;"- And even if, time to haul balls."
38:26;38:31;"And even if the driver wasn't charged for the lost pizza,"
38:31;38:34;"they might still have a nervousness about losing their job"
38:34;38:37;"if they were late too often."
38:37;38:40;"I also wonder, how often would you be leaving Domino's"
38:40;38:43;"with one delivery for one address?"
38:43;38:46;"Often, or you're always trying to get two or three?"
38:46;38:50;"- I mean, maybe half the time, it'd be one address."
38:50;38:53;"And then during busy rushes, you'd have, I don't know,"
38:53;38:55;"two or three or four."
38:55;38:57;"- So just imagine without a phone,"
38:57;39:00;"no maps or anything like that."
39:00;39:03;"Your local driver, you probably know the area pretty well,"
39:03;39:06;"but still, you would occasionally be like,"
39:06;39:11;"""This one's on 19 East Hamilton Way."""
39:11;39:14;"And you're like, ""I think I know where that is."""
39:14;39:15;"And you have to get out the big map"
39:15;39:18;"and look up the name of the street in the appendix."
39:18;39:21;"And then imagine you're trying to figure out how to,"
39:21;39:22;"they're like, ""These two are close together."""
39:22;39:24;"And you're in the car trying to figure out"
39:24;39:25;"which one to go to first."
39:25;39:27;"Seems incredibly stressful and difficult."
39:27;39:33;"So I guess by imposing this insane standard,"
39:33;39:35;"it probably did create a corporate culture"
39:35;39:38;"where they knew they needed to invest in tech."
39:38;39:40;"They saw the fallibility of humans."
39:40;39:43;"There is something also very militaristic about the,"
39:43;39:50;"imposing this ticking clock on the food delivery,"
39:50;39:51;"just like Mark Wahlberg"
39:51;39:54;"racing through the streets of Kabul."
39:54;39:56;"Like, ""We're on a mission, we only have this amount of time."""
39:56;39:58;"Yeah, maybe after that lawsuit,"
39:58;39:59;"they just kind of felt like"
39:59;40:01;"there was a feeling within the company that's like,"
40:01;40:03;"""One day we will transcend"
40:03;40:06;"the inefficiencies of flesh and blood."""
40:06;40:08;"- I remember at Papa John's,"
40:08;40:11;"I just remember when we'd leave for delivery,"
40:11;40:15;"you'd have to call out what the time on,"
40:15;40:17;"how long the order had been in for."
40:17;40:20;"So you'd be like, ""Driver out, 22 minutes."""
40:20;40:22;"- Wait, you would just yell it in the store?"
40:22;40:23;"- Yeah, it was just like a, you know,"
40:23;40:25;"I mean, there might be like some carryout orders,"
40:25;40:27;"but like, you know, you'd like yell it"
40:27;40:29;"in the direction of like the store manager."
40:29;40:31;"""Driver out, 22 minutes."""
40:31;40:32;"- Did you get into it?"
40:32;40:34;"- I mean, I would do it."
40:34;40:35;"- No, but I'm like, would you actually be like,"
40:35;40:36;"""Driver out,"" like get,"
40:36;40:37;"or you would just always be kind of like,"
40:37;40:40;"""Uh, driver out, uh."""
40:40;40:42;"(laughs)"
40:42;40:44;"- Probably more of the latter."
40:44;40:46;"Driver out, man."
40:46;40:49;"20 minutes."
40:49;40:50;"- Call games in the refrigerator."
40:50;40:51;"Doors closed."
40:51;40:52;"Lights are out."
40:52;40:54;"- But it's getting hot!"

42:26;42:28;"- I wonder if they cleared that with corporate."
42:28;42:31;"- I mean, that seems really going off book there."
42:31;42:35;"- I mean, any of that loss comes out of his pocket"
42:35;42:36;"or her pocket."
42:36;42:38;"- Well, that also raises the question,"
42:38;42:40;"is there a Rogue Domino's anywhere"
42:40;42:42;"that still does the 30 minutes or less thing?"
42:42;42:45;"- Yeah, if you're in like a tiny town."
42:45;42:46;"- Right."
42:46;42:47;"- I was just thinking about this,"
42:47;42:49;"you know, you're talking about it being militaristic"
42:49;42:51;"and thinking about Jake and, you know,"
42:51;42:53;"16 year old Jake and his fatigues."
42:53;42:56;"And just the idea that if maybe it would be cool"
42:56;42:59;"if Domino's dressed all of their drivers in fatigues."
42:59;43:01;"And like when you just saw your pizza"
43:01;43:03;"get run up to the door,"
43:03;43:05;"I don't know, it's sort of, I think it would be nice."
43:05;43:06;"- Sir, yes sir."
43:06;43:08;"Mr. Koenig, you ordered two large, two topping."
43:08;43:10;"- Go, go, go, go, go, go."
43:10;43:11;"- Fallout."
43:11;43:15;"- Actually, I think maybe we just cracked a code"
43:15;43:17;"for a new business idea."
43:17;43:18;"Military pizza."
43:18;43:19;"- Is that the name of it?"
43:19;43:20;"Military pizza?"
43:20;43:22;"- I mean, we could probably come up with something better."
43:22;43:23;"- Better name."
43:23;43:24;"Working title."
43:24;43:26;"- Maybe we could hire veterans,"
43:26;43:29;"although maybe that's actually messed up"
43:29;43:32;"to make veterans reenact military procedures."
43:32;43:35;"So maybe it is, we just hire just like randos."
43:35;43:37;"We hire just like the rando people who like,"
43:37;43:39;"are like obsessed with the military,"
43:39;43:42;"but never had the courage to enlist."
43:42;43:45;"And they get to dress in military fatigues."
43:45;43:47;"They get to have like the face paint."
43:47;43:50;"They get to work in teams too."
43:50;43:52;"Of course they deliver it in Jeeps."
43:52;43:55;"The boxes are green"
43:55;44:00;"and we guarantee it 10 minutes or less."
44:00;44:02;"- Yeah, it's not an eco-friendly chain."
44:02;44:07;"It is, they consume an enormous amount of resources,"
44:07;44:08;"making the pizza extremely fast"
44:08;44:11;"and getting to you extremely fast."
44:11;44:12;"- Guys."
44:12;44:14;"- And you know, they don't care about"
44:14;44:15;"if there's collateral damage."
44:15;44:18;"I mean, if they like have to run a red light,"
44:18;44:19;"they'll do it."
44:19;44:24;"- Usually there's a lot of usage of smoke bombs."
44:24;44:29;"- Guys, this is terrible."
44:29;44:33;"Domino's is still doing the 30 minute policy in India."
44:33;44:34;"- Oh my God."
44:34;44:35;"Of course they are."
44:35;44:37;"- Of course."
44:37;44:40;"- Indian cities infamously having terrible traffic."
44:40;44:41;"- Right."
44:41;44:43;"- Can you imagine some like rich dude"
44:43;44:45;"from like the upper castes of India,"
44:45;44:48;"ordering Domino's?"
44:48;44:48;"- Wow."
44:48;44:50;"- That's so heavy."
44:50;44:51;"- This is on their website."
44:51;44:53;"Our massive team of store staff"
44:53;44:56;"starts timing the order as soon as they get off the phone."
44:56;44:59;"And then they go into a very specific explanation"
44:59;45:02;"of how many minutes each step in the process comes."
45:02;45:04;"And then they say, next comes the delivery itself."
45:04;45:06;"That never takes more than eight minutes."
45:06;45:07;"- Never, what?"
45:07;45:08;"- Yeah, well that, I mean,"
45:08;45:11;"you have to have very specific hemmed in,"
45:11;45:13;"tight delivery areas."
45:13;45:15;"- So maybe there's just an abundance of Domino's?"
45:15;45:17;"- And it's just seriously geotech."
45:17;45:20;"- Guys, guys, this is insane."
45:20;45:22;"The Domino's founder,"
45:22;45:25;"this is from Bon Appetit magazine, 2011."
45:25;45:29;"The Domino's founder opens a military themed burger joint"
45:29;45:31;"with camo wearing delivery guys."
45:31;45:33;"- Oh my God."
45:33;45:34;"Whoa, we are tapped in."
45:34;45:35;"- Where was this?"
45:35;45:36;"- I didn't even read the article."
45:36;45:38;"I just saw the title."
45:38;45:40;"- Wait, so the founder being Monaghan?"
45:40;45:43;"- Tom Monaghan, founder of Domino's."
45:43;45:44;"- It's called Punisher Burgers."
45:44;45:47;"(laughing)"
45:47;45:51;"- Famous Catholic cause philanthropist"
45:51;45:53;"has decided to get back into the delivery food business"
45:53;45:54;"with a military themed burger joint"
45:54;45:59;"called Green, G-Y-R-E-N-E, Green Burger."
45:59;46:00;"- Oh my God."
46:00;46:03;"- The main selling point is G-Y-R-E-N-E."
46:03;46:04;"- Green?"
46:04;46:05;"- G-Y-R-E-N-E."
46:05;46:06;"- What the hell?"
46:06;46:08;"- Just spell it, green."
46:08;46:10;"- Its main selling point is the way"
46:10;46:11;"they deliver the burgers."
46:11;46:14;"Employees wearing military camo ring your doorbell,"
46:14;46:16;"call you sir and ma'am."
46:16;46:17;"This is insane."
46:17;46:19;"- I know, this is not real."
46:19;46:22;"- Salute after handing off the sack of food."
46:22;46:24;"- Mr. Koding, sir, yes sir."
46:24;46:26;"- And then they run back to their car."
46:26;46:27;"- They salute you?"
46:27;46:32;"- Yes, the delivery people will be called Green Joggers,"
46:32;46:35;"G-Y-R-E-N-E, and their bosses will be called captains"
46:35;46:37;"instead of just managers."
46:37;46:38;"For the curious or confused,"
46:38;46:40;"Green is a nickname for a Marine,"
46:40;46:42;"a World War II mashup of G-I,"
46:42;46:46;"itself short for galvanized iron, and Marine."
46:46;46:50;"Monaghan accidentally joined the Marines in 1956,"
46:50;46:52;"intending to sign up with the Army,"
46:52;46:54;"and he stayed there for a three year tour."
46:54;46:57;"I mean, that's honestly, that's insane."
46:57;47:00;"- That chain didn't exactly thrive."
47:00;47:02;"- It didn't, but that it's the dominoes guy,"
47:02;47:03;"like the fact that you are, yeah, it went bust."
47:03;47:05;"- Wait, so they didn't even open one?"
47:05;47:06;"They opened one? - They opened one."
47:06;47:07;"- Where was it? - They opened one."
47:07;47:08;"- Where?"
47:08;47:09;"Michigan?"
47:09;47:10;"- Monaghan told the National Restaurant News"
47:10;47:14;"that he was not sure, I like this, I do like,"
47:14;47:15;"he's like, I'm not, quote,"
47:15;47:17;"I'm not sure if the concept will work,"
47:17;47:20;"but it's being put into test in two pilot locations"
47:20;47:21;"in Southwest Florida,"
47:21;47:24;"so I guess then maybe another one in Tennessee."
47:24;47:25;"It didn't work, but don't,"
47:25;47:29;"the fact that you could feel"
47:29;47:31;"the sort of militaristic kind of organ,"
47:31;47:34;"like that you could feel that in dominoes,"
47:34;47:35;"this is wild. - This is going way deeper"
47:35;47:36;"than I thought it would."
47:36;47:39;"I thought the dominoes becoming a tech company thing"
47:39;47:41;"is funny, but like,"
47:41;47:43;"I think we're barely scratching the surface here."
47:43;47:46;"Okay, well, hopefully there's a good book on dominoes."
47:46;47:48;"- I feel like that concept could have legs."
47:48;47:52;"I feel like burgers are the wrong food for delivery service,"
47:52;47:55;"'cause like fries are terrible"
47:55;47:57;"five minutes after they're made."
47:57;47:58;"- Yeah. - Burgers,"
47:58;47:59;"you wanna eat a burger that's--"
47:59;48:01;"- Burgers can get all sloppy and move around."
48:01;48:02;"- 40 minutes old, like,"
48:02;48:06;"but I feel like there is a place in American culture"
48:06;48:09;"for a militaristic food delivery."
48:09;48:09;"- Absolutely. - You know,"
48:09;48:11;"maybe it's pizza, maybe it's like,"
48:11;48:14;"what else is good food?"
48:14;48:16;"- Shouldn't it be like rations, like survival food?"
48:16;48:20;"Like cans of like, just to stay on theme."
48:20;48:22;"- Well, that would make sense,"
48:22;48:23;"but still, people,"
48:23;48:25;"that's not a good thing, - Soups and beef stew."
48:25;48:28;"- because the mission is that you have to get there quickly"
48:28;48:30;"because this is hot food."
48:30;48:32;"- I need something hot. - Yeah, you're drinking hot."
48:32;48:34;"- Sure, coffee?"
48:34;48:37;"- I mean, pizza really is like the archetypal,"
48:37;48:42;"true apex food for delivery, I think."
48:42;48:43;"- Military pizza."
48:43;48:45;"I actually, I'm coming back to that name."
48:45;48:47;"I think there's something about it."
48:47;48:50;"Just military-- - Military pizza."
48:50;48:52;"- Or, you know-- - USSS pie."
48:52;48:55;"No. (laughing)"
48:55;48:56;"- Oh, you know what could be cool?"
48:56;48:57;"We could also like split it up"
48:57;48:59;"to all branches of the armed forces"
48:59;49:01;"and have some healthy rivalries in town."
49:01;49:02;"- Oh, yeah. - Where, all right,"
49:02;49:04;"Jake's working late at the studio."
49:04;49:06;"He wants a pie."
49:06;49:08;"He opens the military pizza app,"
49:08;49:10;"and the first thing they ask him is,"
49:10;49:12;"which branch of the military do you wanna order from?"
49:12;49:16;"- Yeah, wait, or do I wanna order from Colonel Pepperoni?"
49:16;49:18;"(laughing)"
49:18;49:20;"- Or Admiral Olive."
49:20;49:24;"You could start a reserves program,"
49:24;49:26;"one weekend a month, two weeks a year,"
49:26;49:28;"just to do a little bit of delivery on the side."
49:28;49:30;"But also, maybe there's another version too"
49:30;49:34;"that's like, I mean, this definitely would not play well,"
49:34;49:37;"but the idea of it not being American military."
49:37;49:39;"Maybe it's like Italian."
49:39;49:40;"You know, they have that,"
49:40;49:42;"in Italy, I've never fully understood it,"
49:42;49:45;"but there's two different,"
49:45;49:46;"I'm sure an Italian person would be like,"
49:46;49:47;"no, you totally have it wrong,"
49:47;49:50;"but my understanding is that there's these two"
49:50;49:53;"similar type police organizations."
49:53;49:57;"There's the police, and then there's the Carabinieri."
49:57;49:59;"I think the Carabinieri is like a little bit"
49:59;50:00;"in between the military and the police,"
50:00;50:03;"but they both are present in many towns and cities,"
50:03;50:05;"so it's a little bit unclear to me"
50:05;50:09;"what their relationship is and what the difference is."
50:09;50:11;"But yeah, maybe we could do kind of like"
50:11;50:13;"an Italian-themed military."
50:13;50:15;"- Colonel Pepperoni."
50:15;50:18;"(laughing)"
50:18;50:20;"- Do you know that there's this chain,"
50:20;50:21;"where did I see it?"
50:21;50:22;"I feel like it's out west a little bit,"
50:22;50:24;"like in Colorado and stuff,"
50:24;50:27;"called Magic Mushroom Pizza."
50:27;50:30;"- Oh yeah, small chain."
50:30;50:32;"- Seinfeld, give me a little info on Magic Mushroom,"
50:32;50:34;"just 'cause I feel like this is like the polar opposite."
50:34;50:37;"- Okay, so yeah, Magic Mushroom Pizza."
50:37;50:40;"- Oh no, I'm thinking, is it Mellow Mushroom?"
50:40;50:42;"- Okay, yeah, there is a Mellow Mushroom as well."
50:42;50:44;"- Oh, it's from Atlanta, that's right."
50:44;50:46;"- I've eaten many a Mellow Mushroom."
50:46;50:49;"- Oh yeah, 'cause you used to live in Georgia."
50:49;50:51;"Ah, that's where I first saw Mellow Mushroom,"
50:51;50:52;"and I had it when in Atlanta."
50:52;50:54;"- That'd be a good band name, too."
50:54;50:55;"- Mellow Mushroom. - I saw Mellow Mushroom."
50:55;50:57;"- Oh, totally. - That'd be a great band name."
50:57;50:59;"- Yeah, and you could just use their logo."
50:59;51:00;"- Oh, hell yeah."
51:00;51:04;"- This anthropomorphic yellow mushroom eating some pizza,"
51:04;51:07;"and he's got kind of like a wink, you know, a sly grin."
51:07;51:11;"There's 150 Mellow Mushrooms, so that's decent."
51:11;51:12;"That's pretty big."
51:12;51:15;"- That's huge, 150, wow."
51:15;51:16;"That's awesome."
51:16;51:20;"- Mellow Mushroom, takes as long as it takes, man."
51:20;51:22;"The average delivery trip,"
51:22;51:24;"depending on how much you order,"
51:24;51:27;"it could take as long as eight to 10 hours."
51:27;51:28;"Hold tight, buddy."
51:28;51:31;"- I mean, if you're in a hurry and looking for efficiency,"
51:31;51:35;"then order from Colonel Pepperoni, be my guest."
51:35;51:40;"It's gonna be, you know, very industrialized and efficient,"
51:40;51:45;"but I mean, it's not gonna satiate"
51:45;51:47;"any sort of spiritual need."
51:47;51:49;"- Mellow Mushroom pizza takes time."
51:49;51:52;"You gotta ride it out, you gotta be open-minded."
51:52;51:55;"There's also DMT Vape Pizza,"
51:55;51:58;"takes 15 minutes if you're really in a hurry."
51:58;52:00;"- And dude, it would be like the CEOs"
52:00;52:02;"of Colonel Pepperoni and Mellow Mushroom,"
52:02;52:05;"like both used to work at the other company."
52:05;52:06;"- Yeah."
52:06;52:09;"- Like the CEO of Colonel Pepperoni started at Mellow Mushroom"
52:09;52:11;"and was like, was just like, yeah, man."
52:11;52:13;"I started working there in '78, and you know what?"
52:13;52:16;"I was like, I hadn't fallen to dead for a few years,"
52:16;52:17;"and it seemed like a good fit,"
52:17;52:19;"but you know what, during the reigning years,"
52:19;52:21;"like I started to have a change of heart about things,"
52:21;52:24;"and I started to see all the things"
52:24;52:25;"that I thought were virtues of Mellow Mushroom"
52:25;52:27;"as real liabilities."
52:27;52:29;"(laughing)"
52:29;52:33;"And then like the guy that runs Mellow Mushroom was like,"
52:33;52:36;"yeah, I was real high-strung as a young man."
52:36;52:39;"I mean, I had enlisted, and things didn't go"
52:39;52:41;"the way I thought they might in bootcamp,"
52:41;52:44;"and I had to like just fully abort from that situation,"
52:44;52:46;"and then--"
52:46;52:46;"- I went AWOL."
52:46;52:47;"- You know, Mellow--"
52:47;52:49;"(laughing)"
53:00;53:27;"I like the idea that Colonel Pepperoni,"
53:27;53:29;"it sounds like, you know,"
53:29;53:31;"it sounds like a McDonald's character,"
53:31;53:33;"like what's his name, Mayor Cheeseburger?"
53:33;53:35;"- Mayor McCheese?"
53:35;53:38;"- Mayor McCheese, just like a big, cutesy, childish thing."
53:38;53:41;"But I like the idea that our Colonel Pepperoni,"
53:41;53:44;"his backstory is just like way darker."
53:44;53:46;"You picture it'd be like a big pepperoni"
53:46;53:47;"with a smiley face or something."
53:47;53:50;"It's like, no, Colonel Pepperoni is a man."
53:50;53:51;"- Oh yeah."
53:51;53:53;"- He's a man, he's played by--"
53:53;53:54;"- Josh Brolin."
53:54;53:55;"- Yeah, something like that."
53:55;53:57;"- I was gonna say like,"
53:57;53:59;"what's that guy's name, Mads Mikkelsen?"
53:59;54:00;"Mads Mikkelsen?"
54:00;54:02;"- Oh, that's a good one too."
54:02;54:03;"(laughing)"
54:03;54:04;"Mads Mikkelsen."
54:04;54:06;"(laughing)"
54:06;54:08;"- He's played by Michael Shannon."
54:08;54:10;"(laughing)"
54:10;54:11;"And it's just like--"
54:11;54:12;"- Russell Crowe."
54:12;54:14;"- It's just like these really intense pictures of him,"
54:14;54:18;"and he has like a very realistic military outfit,"
54:18;54:20;"and his backstory is just like,"
54:20;54:22;"is actually like really dark."
54:22;54:23;"- It's like Frank Castle, man."
54:23;54:24;"It's like no joke."
54:24;54:25;"- Yeah."
54:25;54:29;"The mission-based job is kind of like interesting."
54:29;54:31;"It should pay well,"
54:31;54:34;"and it shouldn't put people at risk, but--"
54:34;54:36;"- Thank you for calling Colonel Pepperoni's."
54:36;54:37;"This is Jake, how may I help you?"
54:37;54:39;"- Also, what about like,"
54:39;54:41;"this is back to some kind of Punisher Burger (beep),"
54:41;54:43;"but what if Colonel Pepperoni was also like,"
54:43;54:45;"was literally one person?"
54:45;54:46;"It was kind of like Captain America,"
54:46;54:48;"it's only one person at a time."
54:48;54:50;"And, you know, this would be an interesting way"
54:50;54:52;"to actually, I feel like at this point,"
54:52;54:56;"pop-up restaurants are so like mid-2000s."
54:56;54:57;"- Right."
54:57;54:57;"- I'm sure people still like them,"
54:57;54:59;"but you know, the novelty of like,"
54:59;55:01;"oh my God, there's this cute little pop-up place"
55:01;55:02;"that's only there for a little bit,"
55:02;55:04;"or food trucks or stuff."
55:04;55:05;"Obviously that stuff still exists,"
55:05;55:07;"but I feel like the real excitement"
55:07;55:11;"about these like temporary special pop-ups and food trucks"
55:11;55:14;"kind of peaked maybe about 10 years ago."
55:14;55:15;"But--"
55:15;55:16;"- Interesting."
55:16;55:17;"- I think what they're missing,"
55:17;55:19;"what would really make one stand out from the pack now"
55:19;55:21;"is something kind of narrative."
55:21;55:25;"So if there was a story about this kind of mysterious"
55:25;55:28;"ex-military dude who made incredible pizza,"
55:28;55:31;"and you would just kind of like get these like,"
55:31;55:36;"like a weird flyer, or somebody just like posts on like--"
55:36;55:39;"- Yeah, just like weird punk flyer on like a telephone pole."
55:39;55:42;"- Like a mysterious kind of QAnon type post"
55:42;55:44;"on 8chan or something."
55:44;55:46;"And it's just basically like,"
55:46;55:48;"I don't know, this information is totally unverified,"
55:48;55:52;"but it sounds like Colonel Pepperoni"
55:52;55:55;"is coming to Tacoma in November."
55:55;55:57;"And there's just like this buzz in the city,"
55:57;55:58;"and people are like, ""What the (beep)?"""
55:58;55:59;"And be like, ""The only way to do it"
55:59;56:02;"""is to download the Colonel Pepperoni app."""
56:02;56:05;"And like, it is something like everybody puts in the orders,"
56:05;56:07;"each pizza costs $300,"
56:07;56:09;"and then you don't know if it's gonna come,"
56:09;56:11;"and everybody's waiting."
56:11;56:12;"You invite your friends over,"
56:12;56:13;"and you're like, ""Holy (beep), holy (beep),"
56:13;56:15;"""are we gonna get a Colonel Pepperoni pizza?"""
56:15;56:17;"And then you get like this buzz"
56:17;56:21;"that's just like a very ominous countdown, 10."
56:21;56:23;"It's like starts at 10 minutes, 10, nine."
56:23;56:25;"And then just like this weird ass dude comes,"
56:25;56:28;"the pizza's in like a black box."
56:28;56:28;"(laughing)"
56:28;56:30;"Almost like some X-Files. - I was thinking,"
56:30;56:31;"yeah, I was thinking like,"
56:31;56:35;"what is Colonel Pepperoni's sort of online"
56:35;56:37;"sort of Twitter brand voice?"
56:37;56:40;"But maybe it is just like going to visit some"
56:40;56:43;"ex-Marine buddies in Tacoma."
56:43;56:45;"And then they're like, ""Oh, (beep),"
56:45;56:47;"""Colonel Pepperoni's gonna be here."""
56:47;56:48;"In town."
56:48;56:49;"- Yep."
56:49;56:50;"- So he's sort of just like a dude."
56:50;56:51;"- Yeah."
56:51;56:52;"- You know, like, ""My mom's sick."
56:52;56:55;"""I gotta head up to Seattle, Washington."""
56:55;56:56;"- Right."
56:56;56:57;"Well, yeah, you know what?"
56:57;56:59;"We're taking the Frank Castle Punisher burgers"
56:59;57:00;"to the next level,"
57:00;57:03;"where it's not merely this backstory,"
57:03;57:04;"it's an ongoing story,"
57:04;57:08;"where it's like, why is Colonel Pepperoni in Tacoma?"
57:08;57:10;"- You know, like taking like Liam Neeson,"
57:10;57:12;"like he has like-- - Great film."
57:12;57:14;"- Yeah, yeah, and he's like a lone wolf,"
57:14;57:17;"but like when it comes time to like get some help,"
57:17;57:19;"he's got like his old crew of like--"
57:19;57:20;"- Yes."
57:20;57:21;"- Military special ops guys."
57:21;57:23;"So I feel like there's kind of like,"
57:23;57:25;"maybe there's a bit of an outfit like that"
57:25;57:26;"with Colonel Pepperoni."
57:26;57:27;"- Oh, I love that."
57:27;57:29;"But that also makes me think that realistically,"
57:29;57:32;"our version is a bit too dark."
57:32;57:34;"We live in the MCU world now,"
57:34;57:36;"where truly-- - Right."
57:36;57:37;"- And I hate to say this,"
57:37;57:39;"it's just so much less interesting,"
57:39;57:41;"but I think like,"
57:41;57:42;"there's probably some version"
57:42;57:44;"where we create a bunch of like superheroes,"
57:44;57:46;"and they roll up to town together."
57:47;57:48;"No, but let's keep it like"
57:48;57:51;"on the realistic side of comics, you know, like--"
57:51;57:53;"- Yeah, harsh realism,"
57:53;57:54;"just like Rambo first blood style."
57:54;57:56;"- We're going for like the dark side of Marvel,"
57:56;58:00;"the Punisher, Nick Fury, these kind of people."
58:00;58:01;"- His name is John Pepperoni."
58:01;58:04;"(laughing)"
58:04;58:08;"Colonel Pepperoni is doing a residency in West Hollywood."
58:08;58:09;"(laughing)"
58:09;58:12;"- And then he has an arch enemy who's doing the same thing."
58:12;58:16;"And there's like, there's kind of like this deep fear."
58:16;58:18;"There's an undercurrent of deep fear in the country,"
58:18;58:20;"'cause we always have a vague sense"
58:20;58:22;"of where John Pepperoni is,"
58:22;58:25;"but then there's also like Frank Mushroom--"
58:25;58:27;"- Major deep dish."
58:27;58:29;"- Yeah, like just imagine that every,"
58:29;58:30;"we kind of like, we have a very simple map,"
58:30;58:32;"and you're always monitoring them."
58:32;58:33;"And then you get this like,"
58:33;58:35;"they're on the two different coasts,"
58:35;58:38;"and we kind of like start to feed this story about like,"
58:38;58:40;"when these guys see each other,"
58:40;58:42;"they'll have no choice but to kill each other."
58:42;58:44;"It's gonna be pandemonium."
58:44;58:45;"And then just like little by little,"
58:45;58:47;"they're both heading in direction."
58:47;58:49;"And then, you know, all the fans are watching,"
58:49;58:50;"just like, holy (beep)"
58:50;58:52;"these guys are about to meet up in Chicago."
58:52;58:56;"And then we have this like whole narrative battle Chicago."
58:56;58:58;"I don't know what form that actually takes."
58:58;59:00;"- I like that, you know, I can see,"
59:00;59:02;"the taken thing has me think it's like, yeah,"
59:02;59:06;"like John Pepperoni's going to Los Angeles"
59:06;59:10;"to visit his estranged daughter."
59:10;59:11;"They haven't spoken in years."
59:11;59:12;"- Right, right."
59:12;59:13;"- And then when he gets there--"
59:13;59:15;"- He'll be making pizzas in West Hollywood--"
59:15;59:16;"- For three weeks."
59:16;59:18;"- For three weeks, but then when he gets there,"
59:18;59:20;"he's like, his daughter's not there."
59:20;59:23;"- But he's sold her six months in advance though."
59:23;59:25;"- Yeah, but the daughter's been taken"
59:25;59:28;"by this competitor now is in Chicago."
59:28;59:29;"I just feel like there's like a lot--"
59:29;59:31;"- But he has to stay, but he's booked out time."
59:31;59:34;"He has to stay in West Hollywood for three weeks."
59:34;59:34;"- To finish out his order."
59:34;59:38;"- He's sold three weeks of pizza six months in advance."
59:38;59:39;"So even though his daughter's been taken,"
59:39;59:42;"he has to like fulfill his contract and make the pizza."
59:42;59:43;"- I love the idea."
59:43;59:46;"I love the idea of like the pizza being his burden,"
59:46;59:48;"like almost like his duty."
59:48;59:49;"Like he doesn't take--"
59:49;59:50;"- His cross to bear."
59:50;59:51;"- It's his cross to bear, exactly."
59:51;59:54;"(laughs)"
59:54;59:55;"- He's a Christ figure."
59:55;59:56;"- Very grim."
59:56;59:56;"- He was put on this--"
59:56;59:58;"- Man, I watched ""Rambo First Blood"" last year."
59:58;01:00:00;"That movie is so legit."
01:00:00;01:00:01;"That's one of the best Vietnam movies."
01:00:01;01:00:04;"Just weird sidetrack, but just shout out."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"Just shout out to ""First Blood."""
01:00:05;01:00:06;"- No, I know you're a big ""Rambo"" fan."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"- Hard recommend to the audience."
01:00:08;01:00:10;"- There's definitely something here."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"I mean, basically it's like ""Food Truck"""
01:00:11;01:00:15;"meets kind of narrative storytelling."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"'Cause you know, I remember there used to be this excitement,"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"ooh, that food truck comes on Tuesdays"
01:00:19;01:00:20;"to this park or something."
01:00:20;01:00:22;"Also to really build, not a food truck,"
01:00:22;01:00:25;"but some kind of like, what car would he have?"
01:00:25;01:00:26;"Just like some--"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"- A tank, dude."
01:00:28;01:00:30;"(laughs)"
01:00:30;01:00:33;"- I think it's a makeshift food truck"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"that he like constructed himself."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"And it's pretty good."
01:00:36;01:00:37;"Like he did a pretty good job."
01:00:37;01:00:38;"- Bulletproof."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"- And it's painted with camo and stuff."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"- Totally."
01:00:41;01:00:44;"- No, dude, I like that it's like $300 pizzas"
01:00:44;01:00:45;"and you have to, but you have to,"
01:00:45;01:00:47;"to sell a $300 pizza, you have to commit to the aesthetic."
01:00:47;01:00:51;"So it's a tank that's parked on Sunset Boulevard"
01:00:51;01:00:52;"for three weeks."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"It got the clearance from the city."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"And there's like dudes with like rifles,"
01:00:56;01:00:57;"like standing like,"
01:00:57;01:01:00;"just next to the tank."
01:01:00;01:01:02;"And it's like a full performance art thing."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"The pizza has to be really good"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"so you have to like back it up."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"- Wait, real quick, 'cause I felt,"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"can you find anybody in America"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"who's actually named John Pepperoni?"
01:01:11;01:01:12;"I love the idea of keeping it authentic"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"by working backwards."
01:01:13;01:01:14;"- John!"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"- I feel like generally,"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"almost any Italian word you can think of,"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"there often is somebody with that name."
01:01:20;01:01:23;"Like I've heard of people with the last name pizza."
01:01:23;01:01:23;"Why not pepperoni?"
01:01:23;01:01:27;"- I mean, the first results are,"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"I'm just on whitepages.com now"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"'cause the first Google results are like,"
01:01:31;01:01:32;"Papa John's pepperoni."
01:01:32;01:01:34;"- Oh, yeah, no, no, no."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"- Yeah."
01:01:35;01:01:35;"Oh, oh, okay."
01:01:35;01:01:38;"First result is a (beep) pepperoni."
01:01:38;01:01:38;"That's with,"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"what?"
01:01:41;01:01:42;"- One P,"
01:01:42;01:01:43;"P-E-P-E-R."
01:01:43;01:01:45;"- Pepperoni is the last name of the,"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"so sick."
01:01:47;01:01:49;"- There are alternate spellings."
01:01:49;01:01:51;"I have a John Pepperoni,"
01:01:51;01:01:55;"P-E-P-E-R-O-N-E."
01:01:55;01:01:56;"- I kinda like that."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"- Oh, he might say pepperon, but yeah, okay."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"- Pepperon. - John Pepperon."
01:01:59;01:02:03;"- Seems like pepperon is actually a pretty common surname."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"No other pepperonis."
01:02:05;01:02:06;"I feel like we've really blown up."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"- So it's just (beep) pepperoni?"
01:02:07;01:02:08;"- I'm out here."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"Maybe bleep the (beep) for her privacy"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"'cause it seems like there aren't."
01:02:12;01:02:14;"Oh, there's a J-P pepperoni as well."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"- Okay, I'm into that, J-P pepperoni."
01:02:16;01:02:18;"- Pretty smooth."
01:02:18;01:02:22;"Imagine seeing that on a business card."
01:02:22;01:02:26;"- Yeah, just like, private eye, J-P pepperoni."
01:02:26;01:02:28;"- I'm a strong consultant."
01:02:28;01:02:31;"- It is actually way cooler for the story."
01:02:31;01:02:34;"It makes it a little less madcap kooky"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"if it is just spelled pepperon."
01:02:36;01:02:37;"I mean, that would actually be"
01:02:37;01:02:40;"in some hard-boiled detective novel"
01:02:40;01:02:44;"where he's this guy kind of crisscrossing the country"
01:02:44;01:02:45;"serving pizza and people are just like,"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"Mr. Pepperoni, I can't thank you enough."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"And he's like, it's pepperon."
01:02:49;01:02:54;"That would be his little thing at the end of every episode."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"It's pepperon."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"- Okay, so we got a new business"
01:02:57;01:03:00;"to compliment Punisher Burger."
01:03:00;01:03:02;"So we got Colonel Pepperonis."
01:03:02;01:03:04;"- Colonel Pepperon."

01:03:42;01:03:44;"- We got a little bit off track,"
01:03:44;01:03:47;"but we made a new friend, John Pepperoni."
01:03:47;01:03:48;"- Yeah."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"- I have a feeling he'll be with us for a long time."
01:03:50;01:03:54;"And I personally feel a sense of calm"
01:03:54;01:03:57;"knowing that he's driving across this country"
01:03:57;01:04:01;"in his camo food truck."
01:04:01;01:04:05;"- His camo food truck tank making $300 pizzas"
01:04:05;01:04:08;"and battling his sworn enemies."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"We have avoided the Noid."
01:04:10;01:04:13;"Jake, do you wanna talk about the Noid now?"
01:04:13;01:04:14;"- I don't."
01:04:14;01:04:15;"I'm good."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"I think we like tapped out on,"
01:04:16;01:04:19;"we've been talking about dominoes for a long time."
01:04:19;01:04:20;"I think for the sake of the show,"
01:04:20;01:04:23;"we should like transition to another topic."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"- Okay, you got good instincts, Jake."
01:04:25;01:04:27;"I do think we should bring back the Noid at some point."
01:04:27;01:04:28;"- Yeah, maybe another show."
01:04:28;01:04:30;"- Maybe another show."
01:04:30;01:04:32;"I don't think two hours of dominoes"
01:04:32;01:04:35;"is like a great vibe for the show."
01:04:35;01:04:36;"I mean, it's a solid vibe."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"It's not a great vibe though."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"(laughing)"
01:04:40;01:04:42;"- That's a ""This Show Sucks"" moment."
01:04:42;01:04:45;"- Yeah, like, damn, those guys are,"
01:04:45;01:04:47;"they're skipping the top five this week"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"to talk about the Noid?"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"- I was kind of into the pepperon stuff,"
01:04:51;01:04:56;"but then it got really dry just like at an hour 52 minutes,"
01:04:56;01:04:59;"just like, now they went back to when Bain Capital bought it"
01:04:59;01:05:04;"and Jake's breaking down kind of like the deal points."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"Just like, whoa, you know what?"
01:05:06;01:05:08;"This show sucks."
01:05:08;01:05:11;"- And this has been this week's time crisis."
01:05:11;01:05:13;"- Yeah, we're just in the middle of like,"
01:05:13;01:05:17;"and then the Noid, oh, (beep) ran out of time."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"Okay, see you guys in two weeks."
01:05:19;01:05:21;"This show sucks."
01:05:21;01:05:23;"All right, Jake, I do want to talk about the Noid"
01:05:23;01:05:24;"at some point, but you're right,"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"we've gone pretty deep on dominoes."
01:05:26;01:05:29;"I will say, you never know when we start going deep"
01:05:29;01:05:29;"on one of these things."
01:05:29;01:05:32;"Sometimes it's more or less what you expect."
01:05:32;01:05:33;"Sometimes it's just funny."
01:05:33;01:05:36;"There is something about dominoes that it did feel"
01:05:36;01:05:41;"like we tapped into something weird, fascinating, dark,"
01:05:41;01:05:44;"futuristic, militaristic."
01:05:44;01:05:47;"- Yeah, I like the dominoes, Robocop connection."
01:05:47;01:05:50;"'Cause I think Robocop was set in Detroit too."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"So it's like, there's some real Michigan energy."
01:05:52;01:05:55;"- So the last thing we'll say is if anybody listening"
01:05:55;01:05:59;"knows anybody who delivered in the 30 minutes or less era,"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"please, we'd love to talk to you."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"Maybe if anybody knows somebody"
01:06:02;01:06:06;"who currently delivers in India, we'd love to talk to you."
01:06:06;01:06:09;"And if we have any TC heads in Houston"
01:06:09;01:06:13;"who are dominoes fans, please try to get a delivery"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"from the autonomous vehicle."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"- I'd love to see footage of that."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"- Just also picture like back in like the early nineties,"
01:06:19;01:06:22;"just like pitching something in Hollywood."
01:06:22;01:06:26;"- Okay, the film takes place in the year 2021."
01:06:26;01:06:29;"An autonomous pizza delivery vehicle"
01:06:29;01:06:31;"has just hit the streets of Houston."
01:06:31;01:06:32;"- Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down."
01:06:32;01:06:33;"What's that?"
01:06:33;01:06:36;"- It's full Robocop."
01:06:36;01:06:38;"- It's full Demolition Man too,"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"when Taco Bell is the only restaurant"
01:06:40;01:06:41;"that has survived the restaurant wars."
01:06:41;01:06:46;"- I never saw Demolition Man, is that?"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"- I feel like that's set in like 2014 or something."
01:06:50;01:06:54;"It's just like, this movie, it was like from the mid nineties"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"and it was set like 20 years in the future."
01:06:56;01:06:58;"And I was just like, like Sylvester Stallone"
01:06:58;01:07:00;"is at like the high end Taco Bell."
01:07:00;01:07:01;"- It was 2032."
01:07:01;01:07:04;"- Oh, 2032, honestly not that far off."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"- All right, Taco Bell, you got 11 years left"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"to win the restaurant wars."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"- If we're still doing TC in 2032,"
01:07:10;01:07:13;"we should really do a deep dive on Demolition Man."
01:07:13;01:07:14;"- Oh, absolutely."
01:07:14;01:07:16;"That'll be the theme."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"- Mark your calendars."
01:07:17;01:07:21;"- Okay, so we're gonna transition to Billy Joel."
01:07:21;01:07:22;"- As you do."
01:07:22;01:07:24;"- It's a somewhat painful."
01:07:24;01:07:28;"I'm still so enchanted by this strange,"
01:07:28;01:07:33;"dystopian dominoes world, but it is Billy Joel's birthday."
01:07:33;01:07:35;"So how old is he turning today?"
01:07:35;01:07:36;"- 72."
01:07:36;01:07:39;"- Happy 72nd birthday, Mr. Joel."
01:07:39;01:07:42;"I was thinking, what song should we look at?"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"I mean, there's so many classic BJ songs."
01:07:44;01:07:46;"I might, we may have mentioned this song,"
01:07:46;01:07:48;"but I don't think we ever went deep on it."
01:07:48;01:07:49;"This seemed like an interesting one."
01:07:49;01:07:52;"And actually I felt like I was getting a vibe"
01:07:52;01:07:53;"off some of the new brews."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"I don't wanna blow up your spot, Jake."
01:07:55;01:07:59;"But one of them had a slightly dystopian,"
01:07:59;01:08:02;"climate change, anxiety vibe."
01:08:02;01:08:03;"Is that fair to say?"
01:08:03;01:08:04;"- Sure, yeah."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"- Is that like a theme?"
01:08:05;01:08:06;"- 97 in the shade."
01:08:06;01:08:09;"- Yeah, it's one about how hot it's getting."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"It actually seemed like, from what I've heard,"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"there's a somewhat, something of a preoccupation"
01:08:12;01:08:15;"with like natural disasters and climate."
01:08:15;01:08:17;"Is there a theme developing?"
01:08:17;01:08:20;"- Yeah, I like writing songs about that stuff."
01:08:20;01:08:23;"I mean, I like writing songs about drinking"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"and I like writing songs about"
01:08:25;01:08:29;"just sort of like general, like time going by"
01:08:29;01:08:30;"and like, what does that mean?"
01:08:30;01:08:33;"And like, what is the future gonna look like?"
01:08:33;01:08:36;"And, but like making it sound like an Eagle song."
01:08:36;01:08:39;"- Yeah, actually now I'm thinking back on your first hit,"
01:08:39;01:08:42;"""Mountain Bruise,"" beautiful song."
01:08:42;01:08:45;"There's this moment when the narrator"
01:08:45;01:08:46;"is up at the top of a mountain"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"looking at the buildings below"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"and then says, ""Wouldn't take much for those buildings"

01:09:32;01:09:34;"So like a lot of people don't know it."
01:09:34;01:09:36;"And it's speaking of like, you know,"
01:09:36;01:09:40;"choosing years that sounded futuristic in the 20th century,"

01:09:53;01:09:55;"And you know, he's writing in the '70s."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"So, you know, New York was on hard times"
01:09:57;01:09:58;"and probably a lot of people felt like"
01:09:58;01:10:01;"there was an apocalyptic energy in New York."
01:10:01;01:10:04;"But so he's imagining everybody who goes going down to Miami."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"But let's get into it."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Let's throw on this tune."
01:10:08;01:10:10;"- I should write a song called ""Taco Bell 2032."""
01:10:11;01:10:13;"(laughing)"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"- Perfect."
01:10:14;01:10:15;"- You know what's funny though?"
01:10:15;01:10:16;"It's like New York in the '70s,"
01:10:16;01:10:19;"I think of that as more like decrepit and neglected"
01:10:19;01:10:22;"and not so much like apocalyptic."
01:10:22;01:10:26;"Like apocalyptic to me, like is like futuristic."
01:10:26;01:10:29;"Like technology has, like things have accelerated so fast"

01:10:31;01:10:33;"That's what I think of in terms of apocalypse."

01:10:34;01:10:37;"I think of just as like corruption,"
01:10:37;01:10:40;"like old school corruption and like neglect."
01:10:40;01:10:41;"- Right."

01:11:46;01:11:47;"- A lot going on."
01:11:47;01:11:50;"This song also to me says so much about Billy Joel"

01:11:52;01:11:57;"some classic, ""Piano Man,"" ""New York State of Mind."""
01:11:57;01:11:59;"- ""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant."""
01:11:59;01:12:00;"- ""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant."""
01:12:00;01:12:02;"And actually all those songs I think contain"
01:12:02;01:12:06;"a bit of his ambition and his depth of feeling."
01:12:06;01:12:08;"But there's something about this song"
01:12:08;01:12:09;"where you're kind of like, you know what?"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"Billy Joel's like a deep thinker."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"He's kind of angry."
01:12:13;01:12:14;"He's kind of pessimistic."
01:12:14;01:12:17;"He's like a funny choice for like a kind of a song"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"and dance man."
01:12:19;01:12:20;"I mean, like somebody might say I'm totally wrong,"
01:12:20;01:12:24;"but it's like, he was almost like the Bruno Mars of his day."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"Just like this super talented hit maker"
01:12:26;01:12:29;"can kind of try things in different genres."
01:12:29;01:12:31;"Maybe one day Bruno Mars will release"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"some like really like angry music."
01:12:33;01:12:35;"And definitely some of his like later hits"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"have a slightly like eerier feeling."
01:12:37;01:12:41;"But I just feel like Billy Joel's this guy who probably,"
01:12:41;01:12:42;"I think probably part of the drama"
01:12:42;01:12:45;"of his professional life was feeling like,"
01:12:45;01:12:48;"people think I'm like Barry Manilow,"
01:12:48;01:12:50;"like making easy listening stuff."
01:12:50;01:12:53;"But no, I'm like a dude, I'm haunted by visions"
01:12:53;01:12:56;"of the place where I'm from being laid,"
01:12:56;01:13:00;"you know, turning into ruins."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"He's like Cassandra, the oracle,"
01:13:03;01:13:05;"where he could see the future,"
01:13:05;01:13:07;"but nobody would believe it."
01:13:07;01:13:08;"And in his case, it's because the songs"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"are just so beautiful."
01:13:10;01:13:12;"And he was just so good at writing pop songs."
01:13:12;01:13:14;"But he weirdly, this song is like,"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"I can't even know what to compare it to."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"It's like some dark like Prague song."
01:13:18;01:13:21;"But anyway, I seen the lights go out on Broadway."
01:13:21;01:13:23;"I saw the Empire State laid low"
01:13:23;01:13:25;"and life went on beyond the Palisades."
01:13:25;01:13:27;"They all bought Cadillacs and left there long ago."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"Everybody head out."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"And this is where it gets very interesting."
01:13:30;01:13:33;"Like you could just write a whole thing about just like,"
01:13:33;01:13:35;"you could just think of other New York landmarks"
01:13:35;01:13:38;"and be like, and Times Square was empty."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"And Central Park was full of animals."
01:13:40;01:13:44;"And the, you know, Statue of Liberty was,"
01:13:44;01:13:45;"fell into the ocean."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"But then he pivots to this weird thing."
01:13:47;01:13:49;"They held a concert out in Brooklyn"
01:13:49;01:13:51;"to watch the island bridges blow."
01:13:51;01:13:53;"So he's like getting weirdly specific"
01:13:53;01:13:57;"where he's like really envisioning this like formal thing"
01:13:57;01:14:00;"where they're like, Manhattan's a rap."
01:14:00;01:14:02;"And he, also this idea,"
01:14:02;01:14:06;"'cause this is like a classic trope in TV and movies"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"of blowing the bridges to Manhattan."
01:14:08;01:14:12;"Like, I feel like that's part of like Escape from New York,"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"which came out years after this,"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"where it's kind of like Manhattan was like left"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"as like this kind of prison complex"
01:14:18;01:14:21;"and like all the bridges were blown"
01:14:21;01:14:22;"because like nobody can go there"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"'cause it's a danger zone."
01:14:24;01:14:26;"So this idea that like Billy Joel's writing this,"
01:14:26;01:14:29;"you know, he's not the first person to imagine New York"
01:14:29;01:14:30;"or any major city abandoned,"
01:14:30;01:14:34;"but he suddenly goes from like these scenes of emptiness"
01:14:34;01:14:37;"and then just imagining like this,"
01:14:37;01:14:40;"a big concert being held on the day"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"they blow up the bridges to make sure nobody can,"
01:14:42;01:14:43;"there's something about that that I'm just like,"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"damn, Billy, where'd you get that one?"
01:14:45;01:14:48;"That's like kind of weird and deep and like--"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"- Also, they held a concert out in Brooklyn."
01:14:50;01:14:54;"He's like foreshadowing the exodus"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"from Manhattan into Brooklyn."
01:14:56;01:15:00;"The shift of the cultural center towards Brooklyn."
01:15:00;01:15:03;"He was just gobbling up real estate in Williamsburg"
01:15:03;01:15:05;"on the cheap back then."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"- He's buying all those properties over on Bedford"
01:15:07;01:15:12;"and I don't even remember the streets over there, whatever."
01:15:12;01:15:14;"What are the other streets in Brooklyn, in that area?"
01:15:14;01:15:15;"- Roebling."
01:15:15;01:15:17;"- Oh yeah, okay, yeah."
01:15:17;01:15:20;"- No, Billy Joel owns like three full blocks of Roebling."
01:15:20;01:15:24;"They turned our power down and drove us underground,"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"but we went right on with the show."
01:15:26;01:15:28;"See, now I don't even, I'm a little bit confused,"
01:15:28;01:15:31;"but still, the fact that he's picturing this weird mix"
01:15:31;01:15:35;"of like the mundane and the apocalyptic is like kind of deep."
01:15:35;01:15:37;"Okay, let's listen to the second verse."
01:15:37;01:15:38;"- Let's keep going."

01:17:37;01:17:38;"- Oh, right."

01:20:37;01:20:38;"I mean, obviously it's written"
01:20:38;01:20:41;"from like a '70s New York perspective,"
01:20:41;01:20:43;"although I guess they say he was in LA when he wrote it,"
01:20:43;01:20:48;"but still, he's a Long Island guy, tri-state area dude."
01:20:48;01:20:50;"So he's picturing everybody moved to Florida,"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"which is interesting 'cause during COVID"
01:20:52;01:20:54;"that became this whole thing about like,"
01:20:54;01:20:56;"oh, are people abandoning New York?"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"And Miami seems to be like popping"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"and people wanna go there."
01:21:00;01:21:02;"But then the idea that the mafia took over Mexico,"

01:21:11;01:21:15;"- Yeah, he's not talking about the Mexican drug cartels."
01:21:15;01:21:20;"He's talking about like John Pepperoni taking over Mexico."
01:21:20;01:21:22;"- Yeah, that didn't quite happen."
01:21:22;01:21:23;"- That didn't pan out."
01:21:23;01:21:26;"- But in a weird way, the song kind of sticks to landing."
01:21:26;01:21:27;"There are not many who remember."
01:21:27;01:21:29;"They say a handful still survive to tell the world"
01:21:29;01:21:32;"about the way the lights went out and keep the memory alive."
01:21:32;01:21:36;"So in a weird way, he was correct in that,"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"I've never seen it, but I like what you're saying, Jake,"
01:21:38;01:21:41;"the final episode of ""The Deuce"" vibe."
01:21:41;01:21:46;"Billy was correct in that this period that he was seeing"

01:22:02;01:22:04;"This place will be forgotten."
01:22:04;01:22:06;"And Miami will be like the new cultural center."""
01:22:06;01:22:10;"He was correct in the sense that that moment"
01:22:10;01:22:13;"is kind of forgotten, that the people who really lived it"
01:22:13;01:22:16;"and were part of the culture of that moment,"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"very few of them are around."
01:22:18;01:22:19;"And even if they're around,"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"the world they live in is so different"
01:22:21;01:22:23;"that their memory, yeah,"
01:22:23;01:22:25;"a handful of people keep the memory alive."
01:22:25;01:22:27;"I guess that's true about apocalyptic stuff."
01:22:27;01:22:30;"It's like either it pans out"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"and truly the city's in ruins"
01:22:32;01:22:37;"and grass will grow over your city and it's forgotten,"
01:22:37;01:22:40;"or it doesn't, and even that intense moment"
01:22:40;01:22:43;"of pain and darkness is forgotten either way."
01:22:43;01:22:44;"You know what I mean?"
01:22:44;01:22:45;"- Damn."
01:22:45;01:22:48;"I remember, this is kind of related to the song."
01:22:48;01:22:53;"I remember being at a Yankee game when I was in my teens"
01:22:53;01:22:54;"and just being like,"
01:22:54;01:22:56;"""What are the circumstances gonna be"
01:22:56;01:22:59;"when there's the final game?"""
01:22:59;01:23:03;"Not at the stadium, but the final Yankees game."
01:23:03;01:23:06;"Are they gonna know it's the final Yankees game?"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"Is it just that the culture will shift"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"and that interest in baseball will wane"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"and they'll just be like,"
01:23:12;01:23:16;"""Yeah, we had to downsize to a different stadium."
01:23:16;01:23:19;"It's really kind of a cultural artifact at this point."
01:23:19;01:23:20;"You know what, we're gonna close up shop."""
01:23:20;01:23:25;"Or is it gonna be massive cataclysmic destruction"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"where that ended up being"
01:23:27;01:23:28;"the final major league baseball game."
01:23:28;01:23:29;"It was crazy."
01:23:29;01:23:31;"No one knew at the time."
01:23:31;01:23:33;"I remember thinking being at a Yankees game"
01:23:33;01:23:36;"in this massive stadium with 40,000 people"
01:23:36;01:23:39;"watching this culturally significant event."
01:23:39;01:23:41;"And it seems so permanent."
01:23:41;01:23:43;"If you think about museums,"
01:23:43;01:23:46;"when will the last day of the Metropolitan Museum of Art"
01:23:46;01:23:48;"in New York City be open?"
01:23:48;01:23:49;"These things will happen."
01:23:49;01:23:51;"- But will people know?"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"- And will it be cataclysmic"
01:23:53;01:23:58;"or will it be just a gradual shift in cultural priorities?"
01:23:58;01:24:00;"- Generally, there's a feeling that a lot of things"
01:24:00;01:24:04;"are too big to fail and you would think they wouldn't know"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"and it would have to be something really cataclysmic."
01:24:06;01:24:11;"But yeah, I don't see baseball being done in our lifetimes."
01:24:11;01:24:12;"But it's a good question."
01:24:12;01:24:14;"Could there be something,"
01:24:14;01:24:17;"will there still be baseball in 200 years?"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"What's the first sport that's gonna go?"
01:24:19;01:24:20;"Hockey?"
01:24:20;01:24:23;"Well, not in Canada, but in the US."
01:24:23;01:24:25;"- Things fade, so I don't know."
01:24:25;01:24:26;"I don't know."
01:24:26;01:24:28;"And that's what Billy's kind of writing about, right?"
01:24:28;01:24:30;"I mean, he's talking about things fading,"
01:24:30;01:24:32;"but also things blowing up."
01:24:32;01:24:33;"I don't know."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"It's not like the most specific song."
01:24:35;01:24:36;"- Right."
01:24:36;01:24:37;"- Which is cool, it's a song."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"It doesn't need to be specific."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"- Miami 2017."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"- Wonder if Billy's got real estate down in Miami."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"- I would guess so."
01:24:45;01:24:46;"- Oh, for sure."
01:24:46;01:24:49;"- Well, I mean, that's what Matt just said to me"
01:24:49;01:24:53;"that that's why Billy picked Miami was specifically"
01:24:53;01:24:58;"because when New Yorkers get old, they go to Miami."
01:24:58;01:24:59;"- Right."
01:24:59;01:25:01;"- I think there'll be a point when real estate in Miami"
01:25:01;01:25:02;"just becomes worthless."
01:25:02;01:25:03;"- Not yet."
01:25:03;01:25:07;"- A friend who's moving there right now says it is popping."
01:25:07;01:25:08;"- Really?"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"- Says it is popping."
01:25:10;01:25:11;"It's like you can't,"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"it's just shot through the roof, interestingly,"
01:25:13;01:25:18;"because there's a whole tech boom that's happening in Miami."
01:25:18;01:25:23;"But to your point, it feels like the whole area"
01:25:23;01:25:26;"would be uninsurable 'cause it's all gonna be underwater."
01:25:26;01:25:28;"So it is like the last gasps."
01:25:28;01:25:31;"I mean, it's like the idea that people would move"
01:25:31;01:25:35;"out there feels, that feels apocalyptic."
01:25:35;01:25:36;"- Well, maybe with all that money there,"
01:25:36;01:25:37;"they'll figure it out."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"- In 2013--"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"- Tech money, they'll raise it up."
01:25:40;01:25:45;"- In 2013, Billy Joel sold his Miami Beach mansion"
01:25:45;01:25:46;"to an Italian--"
01:25:46;01:25:47;"- Wait, hold on, how much?"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"No, you don't tell me."
01:25:49;01:25:53;"I wanna know what the group thinks."
01:25:53;01:25:54;"- Oh, yeah."
01:25:54;01:25:55;"- How much did Billy Joel--"
01:25:55;01:25:55;"- Wait, sorry, what was it?"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"Miami Beach mansion?"
01:25:56;01:25:57;"- In 2013?"
01:25:57;01:26:02;"- Joel does, 2013, and it's on La Gorce Island."
01:26:02;01:26:05;"Does anybody know what the La Gorce--"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"- No, but I know there's these really fancy islands"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"in that area."
01:26:09;01:26:10;"- 18 million."
01:26:10;01:26:12;"- I was gonna guess right around there."
01:26:12;01:26:13;"All right, so I'll go a little bit higher."
01:26:13;01:26:16;"I'll say 21.4."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"- 14 million."
01:26:17;01:26:18;"- Okay."
01:26:18;01:26:21;"- I like when we over-guess."
01:26:21;01:26:24;"- A modest property for Mr. Joel."
01:26:24;01:26:26;"All right, let's get in the top five."
01:26:26;01:26:31;"- It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:26:31;01:26:36;"- We're just gonna do the top five hits of 1971."
01:26:36;01:26:37;"Why 1971?"
01:26:37;01:26:40;"- That was the year that Billy dropped his first record,"
01:26:40;01:26:41;"right?"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"- Yep, I believe his first solo album."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"- Did that have Piano Man on it?"
01:26:45;01:26:46;"- No, not yet."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"This one doesn't really have any hits."
01:26:47;01:26:50;"I think it's called Cold Spring Harbor."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"- Like Cold Spring New York?"
01:26:51;01:26:53;"Isn't that a town?"
01:26:53;01:26:57;"- Yeah, and Cold Spring Harbor's on Long Island."
01:26:57;01:26:57;"- Oh, I see."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"That makes sense."
01:26:59;01:26:59;"- So this, you know,"
01:26:59;01:27:02;"Billy was still not particularly known yet in '71,"
01:27:02;01:27:05;"but he was starting to spread his wings as a solo artist."

01:32:54;01:32:56;"This takes it to like another level."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"- No Neil Diamond's got a deep side."
01:32:58;01:33:00;"He's like, I think he was also frustrated"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"about the way he was seen."
01:33:02;01:33:05;"- I love that Neil was included in the last waltz."
01:33:05;01:33:06;"- Oh right."
01:33:06;01:33:08;"- The final band concert."
01:33:08;01:33:09;"- They had some respect for him."
01:33:09;01:33:12;"- In like '76 or whatever that was."
01:33:12;01:33:14;"When you have like fully coked out Van Morrison,"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"friend of the show."
01:33:16;01:33:17;"And then yeah Neil comes out."
01:33:17;01:33:19;"It's just like, it's all like hip people."
01:33:19;01:33:23;"It's like Joni and like Neil Young."
01:33:23;01:33:24;"And then like Neil Diamond's there"
01:33:24;01:33:27;"and it's like whoa cool, weird."
01:33:27;01:33:30;"He probably felt like he was rolling up to a garden party."
01:33:30;01:33:31;"Just like a mile and a quarter."
01:33:31;01:33:32;"- Oh absolutely."
01:33:32;01:33:33;"- A little bit out of place like whoa."
01:33:33;01:33:34;"But no Neil Diamond's like,"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"he's written a lot of beautiful songs"
01:33:36;01:33:38;"and like I always think too like,"
01:33:38;01:33:40;"I mean this one's overtly,"
01:33:40;01:33:42;"he's probably you know trying to be kind of existential."
01:33:42;01:33:44;"I mean it's such a heavy chorus, I am."
01:33:44;01:33:47;"- But he pulls it off."
01:33:47;01:33:47;"- No totally."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"But I even think about some of his songs"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"that are seen as like pretty simple."
01:33:51;01:33:54;"Like Red Red Wine which has always been"
01:33:54;01:33:55;"one of my favorite songs."
01:33:55;01:33:57;"Like I love all the versions."
01:33:57;01:33:59;"- The Ubi version is (beep) sick."
01:33:59;01:34:00;"- That's great."
01:34:00;01:34:02;"Ubi 40 version's beautiful."
01:34:02;01:34:05;"And I always, the version I first got into was,"
01:34:05;01:34:09;"you know when I was a kid I was so into ska."
01:34:09;01:34:10;"Third wave ska."
01:34:10;01:34:11;"But also all of it."
01:34:11;01:34:14;"So I would, some of like the earliest CDs I bought"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"when I was like 12, 13 were like"
01:34:16;01:34:19;"compilations of like 60s Jamaican ska."
01:34:19;01:34:22;"And so there's this great version by Tony Tribe"
01:34:22;01:34:25;"that was like way before Ubi 40."
01:34:25;01:34:27;"There's this kind of up-tempo ska version."
01:34:27;01:34:29;"♪ Red red wine dun dun dun ♪"
01:34:29;01:34:31;"♪ Da dun dun dun dun ♪"
01:34:31;01:34:34;"And it seems like such a silly childish song"
01:34:34;01:34:36;"when you just kind of take it in."
01:34:36;01:34:37;"You know you can feel the sadness,"

01:34:48;01:34:50;"kind of like alcoholic depression."
01:34:50;01:34:52;"And he also kind of sticks the landing on that too."
01:34:52;01:34:55;"Just like, I don't know if I have the lyrics exactly right,"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"but that line always gets me."

01:40:56;01:40:59;"""Red, red wine, stay close to me."
01:40:59;01:41:00;"""Don't let me be alone."
01:41:00;01:41:04;"""It's tearing apart my blue, blue heart."""
01:41:04;01:41:05;"Like, it is pretty funny."
01:41:05;01:41:08;"He's like singing to the red, red wine"
01:41:08;01:41:09;"and talking about his blue, blue heart,"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"but it makes a lot of sense."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"And it is just like sad."
01:41:13;01:41:15;"He's like, ""My heart's so blue."""
01:41:15;01:41:17;"I guess that's why he chose red, red wine."
01:41:17;01:41:19;"He just needs to add a different shade,"
01:41:19;01:41:22;"chemically, to his existence."
01:41:22;01:41:26;"Anyway, maybe we should go deeper on Neil Diamond."
01:41:26;01:41:28;"I don't think I really knew this song,"
01:41:28;01:41:29;"Jake, ""I Am,"" I said, but."
01:41:29;01:41:30;"- Oh, really?"
01:41:30;01:41:31;"- Let's go a little deeper."
01:41:31;01:41:34;"- Yeah, I mean, I'm down for another ep."
01:41:34;01:41:37;"- The number three song, ""Ocean."""
01:41:37;01:41:41;"Cool name, not familiar."
01:41:41;01:41:43;"Put your hand in the hand."

01:43:21;01:43:24;"That was like the OG Christian rock guy."

01:43:25;01:43:28;"He's sort of credited as like the first"
01:43:28;01:43:30;"Christian rock artist,"
01:43:30;01:43:34;"'cause he put out records in the late '60s"
01:43:34;01:43:35;"that were before this kind of stuff"

01:44:18;01:44:21;"'cause it's like society was like mainstream"
01:44:21;01:44:24;"and the corporate society didn't like hippies."
01:44:24;01:44:26;"And then there was a contingent of hippies"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"that were like, ""Well wait, we're a Christian."
01:44:28;01:44:30;"So maybe like corporate America will like that."""
01:44:30;01:44:33;"And then corporate America or these big record labels"
01:44:33;01:44:35;"were like, ""Well, no, you're too Christian."""
01:44:35;01:44:36;"- Right."
01:44:36;01:44:39;"- You're gonna appeal to like the youth"
01:44:39;01:44:40;"who don't wanna listen to Christian music."
01:44:40;01:44:41;"It's like a funny,"
01:44:41;01:44:45;"like those like hippie Christian artists of this era"
01:44:45;01:44:48;"were like caught in this weird middle ground."
01:44:48;01:44:50;"They were like a little too Christian"
01:44:50;01:44:52;"for like kind of the rock audience"
01:44:52;01:44:55;"and then a little too rock and roll"
01:44:55;01:44:57;"for like the Christian audience."
01:44:57;01:44:58;"- Right."
01:44:58;01:45:00;"Little did they know. - I think of Judy Sill,"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"Ocean and Larry Norman, yeah."
01:45:02;01:45:03;"- Right, little did they know"
01:45:03;01:45:06;"that one day there'd be these kind of like"
01:45:06;01:45:11;"cool mega churches and Christian rap and Christian metal."
01:45:11;01:45:17;"- Wait, who was that like big 80s Christian metal band?"
01:45:17;01:45:18;"- Nelson?"
01:45:18;01:45:19;"Were they kind of Christian?"
01:45:19;01:45:20;"- No, I don't think so."
01:45:20;01:45:21;"There was a huge--"
01:45:21;01:45:24;"- Well, in the 90s there's Jars of Clay."
01:45:24;01:45:25;"- Right. - They're huge."
01:45:25;01:45:27;"- Was it Striper?"
01:45:27;01:45:29;"- Yes, thank you, Seinfeld."
01:45:29;01:45:33;"Always a fascinating sub-genre."
01:45:33;01:45:34;"The only stuff I'm interested in"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"though is that early 70s stuff."
01:45:36;01:45:38;"- Right, 'cause yeah, that's your era."
01:45:38;01:45:40;"(laughing)"
01:45:40;01:45:41;"- That's my era."
01:45:41;01:45:42;"- Well, that's your favorite."
01:45:42;01:45:43;"- No, for sure."
01:45:43;01:45:44;"- The Tasteful Palate."
01:45:44;01:45:45;"- Yeah, the Tasteful Palate"
01:45:45;01:45:47;"and like some of the songs are good."
01:45:47;01:45:48;"- Absolutely."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"- Theoretically, I would like to listen"
01:45:50;01:45:53;"to 80s hair metal Christian rock,"
01:45:53;01:45:57;"but you actually listen to it and it's not a fun hang."
01:45:57;01:45:59;"- And I think there's like a pretty deep zone"
01:45:59;01:46:01;"that I've heard about from people"
01:46:01;01:46:03;"who I know were like in that scene"
01:46:03;01:46:08;"of 90s Christian indie rock and punk."
01:46:08;01:46:09;"- Yeah."
01:46:09;01:46:12;"- Probably was true like on some very independent (beep)"
01:46:12;01:46:13;"you know?"
01:46:13;01:46:14;"- I loved Page of the Lion."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"Did you ever get into that band?"
01:46:15;01:46:17;"- I never actually, I got to."
01:46:17;01:46:18;"I've had enough people tell me to check it out."
01:46:18;01:46:19;"'Cause yeah--"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"- Page of the Lion, the first few records are killer."
01:46:21;01:46:24;"I saw them so many times,"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"like living up in Portland and the Pacific Northwest,"
01:46:26;01:46:27;"like early, late 90s."
01:46:27;01:46:31;"- So they bridge the gap between the GBV heads"
01:46:31;01:46:32;"and the Christians?"
01:46:32;01:46:35;"- Yeah, Page of the Lion shows were interesting"
01:46:35;01:46:38;"because a lot of his songs were about like,"
01:46:38;01:46:40;"if you followed his songwriting,"
01:46:40;01:46:43;"David Bazan's songwriting over an album or two,"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"you saw this creeping doubt."
01:46:45;01:46:47;"Definitely in organized religion"
01:46:47;01:46:49;"and even in his fundamental faith."
01:46:49;01:46:51;"But like the music was like, yeah, it was awesome."
01:46:51;01:46:54;"It was like really good."
01:46:54;01:46:57;"It didn't like rock hard like the way like, I don't know,"
01:46:57;01:46:59;"yeah, like GBV or something would,"
01:46:59;01:47:03;"but it was really cool like indie rock that like,"
01:47:03;01:47:06;"I don't know, he had like a specific voice musically that--"
01:47:06;01:47:07;"- I gotta check that out."
01:47:07;01:47:10;"- Anyway, we'll do a Larry Norman Page of the Lion app."
01:47:10;01:47:11;"- That's tight."
01:47:11;01:47:13;"I think I might be traveling a little bit this summer."
01:47:13;01:47:16;"We might have to start banking some apps."
01:47:16;01:47:18;"Might be smart too."
01:47:18;01:47:19;"- Okay, cool."
01:47:19;01:47:19;"Maybe we do."
01:47:19;01:47:20;"(laughs)"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"We do world religions."
01:47:22;01:47:24;"(laughs)"
01:47:24;01:47:28;"All right, this is the first banked up of the summer."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"We're coming at you."
01:47:29;01:47:32;"We're gonna start with Christianity."
01:47:32;01:47:35;"We got some Page of the Lion coming up."
01:47:35;01:47:37;"Okay, the number two song, 71, Jackson 5,"
01:47:37;01:47:38;"Never Can Say Goodbye."
01:47:38;01:47:42;"All in all, a very smooth top five."
01:47:45;01:47:48;"Definitely that AM Gold kind of energy."
01:47:49;01:47:52;"I feel it's sort of the most consistent."
01:47:52;01:47:56;"- Yes, it all sounds like 1971 AM radio."
01:47:56;01:47:58;"No curve balls so far."
01:48:15;01:48:16;"- Michael Jackson's like one of the best"
01:48:16;01:48:18;"like kid vocalists ever."
01:48:18;01:48:19;"- Yeah."
01:48:19;01:48:21;"- I can't think of any other ones."
01:48:21;01:48:22;"How old was he here?"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"Is he like nine, 10?"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"- What is this, 71?"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"- 71, he had no crunch."
01:48:30;01:48:34;"- He was born in '58."
01:48:34;01:48:35;"So he would have been--"
01:48:35;01:48:36;"- 13."
01:48:36;01:48:37;"- 12, yeah, 13."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"Wow, born in '58."
01:48:39;01:48:41;"- I guess Stevie Wonder was making records"
01:48:41;01:48:44;"when he was very young, like 12 or 13."
01:48:45;01:48:48;"- This is like hard to sing too."
01:48:48;01:48:49;"- No, I mean, obviously he's kind of--"
01:48:49;01:48:51;"- The notes, like the way the notes"
01:48:51;01:48:53;"are sitting over those chords."
01:48:53;01:48:57;"I can picture a lot of people trying to sing this karaoke"
01:48:57;01:48:59;"and just being like really off key."
01:48:59;01:49:00;"- Oh yeah."
