06:40;06:44;"- Welcome to Time Crisis, Volume Five."
06:44;06:48;"That was Brian Eno and John Cale with Spinning Away."
06:48;06:49;"I am still out here in LA."
06:49;06:51;"I thought I'd be back to New York by now,"
06:51;06:52;"but business has kept me out here."
06:52;06:57;"So that means I'm not joined by Cousin Asher and Despot,"
06:57;06:59;"but we can't wait to get back in the studio"
06:59;07:00;"with these guys."
07:00;07:02;"However, here in LA,"
07:02;07:05;"I am joined by longtime friend of the show,"
07:05;07:06;"Jake Longstreth."
07:06;07:07;"What's up, Jake?"
07:07;07:08;"- Hey, man."
07:08;07:11;"- Also, we have a New York resident in town,"
07:11;07:13;"Ethan Silverman of Terrible Records and Yak Radio."
07:13;07:14;"How's it going?"
07:14;07:15;"- Hey, man."
07:15;07:16;"Good to see you."
07:16;07:17;"- Good to see you."
07:17;07:18;"And also, very briefly,"
07:18;07:19;"'cause you can't stay the whole show,"
07:19;07:20;"we have my sister, Emma Kanig."
07:20;07:21;"What's up?"
07:21;07:22;"- Hey, Ezzie."
07:22;07:26;"- So, Emma, you were just back home in Jersey"
07:26;07:26;"hanging out with our parents."
07:26;07:27;"How was that?"
07:27;07:29;"- It was an experience."
07:29;07:30;"It was fun."
07:30;07:31;"- Yeah?"
07:31;07:34;"- Well, my new boyfriend met our parents."
07:34;07:35;"- How did that go?"
07:35;07:36;"- I think it went very well."
07:36;07:37;"- Yeah."
07:37;07:39;"- They were riffing, laughing."
07:39;07:40;"- Uh-huh."
07:40;07:42;"Did you show him some Jersey stuff"
07:42;07:43;"or some New York stuff?"
07:43;07:44;"- I showed him both."
07:44;07:48;"I showed him some home videos,"
07:48;07:50;"which is a risky move,"
07:50;07:53;"'cause I think I was a very annoying kid, maybe."
07:53;07:54;"- Oh, really?"
07:54;07:57;"- Well, in the videos, I'm just very manic."
07:57;07:58;"- Who was more annoying, you or me?"
07:58;08:00;"- I think me."
08:00;08:01;"- Really?"
08:01;08:03;"- Annoying in different ways."
08:03;08:04;"- Oh, okay."
08:04;08:06;"- What age are you in the video?"
08:06;08:11;"- Well, we were watching a particular vacation at Copake."
08:12;08:13;"- That's a town in upstate New York."
08:13;08:17;"- Yeah, and so I feel like maybe I was four"
08:17;08:18;"and you were eight."
08:18;08:21;"And I was definitely in a phase"
08:21;08:23;"of copying everything that you did."
08:23;08:24;"So there's a part where you're doing like--"
08:24;08:25;"- Oh, I remember that."
08:25;08:26;"- A stand-up comedy bit."
08:26;08:28;"- I do a stand-up comedy routine."
08:28;08:29;"And then my mom's like,"
08:29;08:33;"""Oh, Emma, you should do a stand-up routine."""
08:33;08:34;"And I mean, now that I'm older,"
08:34;08:36;"I know this is really true in the stand-up community,"
08:36;08:39;"that joke stealing is very, very frowned upon."
08:39;08:42;"And then Emma got up and literally did all my jokes."
08:42;08:44;"And she literally did my set almost for a bit."
08:44;08:47;"- But I couldn't understand what was funny about it."
08:47;08:49;"So I was just messing up the words"
08:49;08:52;"and it was very depressing to watch."
08:52;08:53;"- No, that sounds cute."
08:53;08:54;"- Hey, everybody."
08:54;08:55;"Hey, guys."
08:55;08:56;"Hey, everybody."
08:56;08:58;"Boy, this is weird."
08:58;09:01;"I haven't done any stand-up on TV for a while."
09:01;09:02;"I hate doing stand-up."
09:02;09:03;"Don't take it the wrong way."
09:03;09:07;"I just, I hate microphones."
09:07;09:09;"I hate holding them."
09:09;09:10;"I hate dealing with them."
09:10;09:11;"I hate talking to them."
09:11;09:14;"I worked at Burger King for three years."

12:03;12:08;"- Also, while you were home, dad emailed me an MP3,"
12:08;12:10;"which I think is a first."
12:10;12:11;"- I helped him."
12:11;12:11;"- Oh, okay. - Yeah."
12:11;12:15;"- So he sent me this MP3 that's called ""Ezzy and Emmy."""
12:15;12:16;"My parents used to call me Ezzy."
12:16;12:18;"Fall '89."
12:18;12:21;"And thought maybe we'd listen to a little bit of it"
12:21;12:22;"since we're both here."
12:22;12:23;"- Okay."
12:23;12:25;"- I think this is ripped from a cassette."
12:25;12:26;"- Yes, I think it was a cassette."
12:26;12:31;"- Hello, this is my show with Emma and my mom."
12:31;12:33;"I think I had a good day at school."
12:33;12:35;"- Mommy."
12:35;12:38;"- I played with my friends Dana and Gregory."
12:38;12:43;"We played with toy cars and then was--"
12:43;12:45;"- Okay, so right off the bat, I have a lot of questions."
12:45;12:47;"So one thing I've been thinking about,"
12:47;12:49;"lately I've been thinking about accents a lot."
12:49;12:52;"I can't tell if I just have like a baby voice"
12:52;12:55;"or if I used to have more of like a New York,"
12:55;12:59;"Joy-Z accent 'cause I say, ""We play with toy cars."""
12:59;13:00;"Or do all kids speak that way?"
13:00;13:04;"- I think all kids have a particular dialect"
13:04;13:07;"that is unique to children, which is,"
13:07;13:10;"I feel like all kids kind of sound like Jersey to me."
13:10;13:11;"I mean, we grew up in New Jersey, so I'm biased."
13:11;13:14;"- Maybe we have no idea 'cause we grew up in New Jersey."
13:14;13:14;"- Yeah."
13:14;13:17;"- When you, if you hear a kid say, ""I played with a toy."""
13:17;13:19;"What does that sound like to yours?"
13:19;13:21;"'Cause Ethan, you grew up in the South."
13:21;13:25;"- In the South, we would say, ""I played with a toy."""
13:25;13:26;"(laughs)"
13:26;13:27;"- Really?"
13:27;13:27;"- Yeah, I just got a new toy."
13:27;13:29;"- Did you have more of a Southern accent"
13:29;13:30;"when you were a child?"
13:30;13:33;"- No, because my parents were both from the Northeast."
13:33;13:34;"- Right."
13:34;13:36;"- So I was surrounded by very Southern sounding children"
13:36;13:40;"that would say toy, but I said, ""Toy."""
13:40;13:41;"- Toy."
13:41;13:42;"- Toy."
13:42;13:44;"I think you just, you emulate your parents, right?"
13:44;13:46;"And then you put a little kid sauce on it."
13:46;13:47;"- Right, well, that's something funny"
13:47;13:48;"'cause I was playing this,"
13:48;13:49;"let me see if there's a part where mom talks."
13:49;13:51;"Mom's very soft-spoken."
13:51;13:55;"- Yeah, she was so gentle in the videos that we watched."
13:55;13:58;"- Say, ""Ezzie."""
13:58;13:59;"- Ezzie."
13:59;14:00;"- Ezzie."
14:00;14:01;"- Say, ""Emmy."""
14:01;14:03;"- Take your fingers and say, ""Emmy."""
14:03;14:04;"- Say, ""Emmy."""
14:04;14:07;"Say, ""Emmy."""
14:07;14:10;"- Mom, come on, it's your turn."
14:10;14:11;"- Say, ""Eyes."""
14:11;14:12;"- Uh, I'm going."
14:12;14:13;"- Let's stop it."
14:13;14:16;"- Uh-oh."
14:16;14:19;"Say, ""Emmy."""
14:20;14:23;"- Mom, come on, it's your turn."
14:23;14:24;"- I'll say, ""Emmy."""
14:24;14:26;"- Twinkle, twinkle."
14:26;14:30;"- The thing is that my mom is like,"
14:30;14:35;"people, when my friends do impressions of her,"
14:35;14:36;"not that they're like doing like stand-up routines,"
14:36;14:37;"but when they're just kind of saying,"
14:37;14:39;"""Oh, your mom said something."""
14:39;14:40;"They do this impression of mom"
14:40;14:42;"that to me sounds like coffee talk."
14:42;14:46;"- Exactly, well, whenever I've imitated mom telling a story"
14:46;14:48;"and I'm doing some kind of extreme"
14:48;14:50;"New York-y, New Jewish, New Jewish."
14:50;14:51;"- New Jewish."
14:51;14:52;"- Freudian slip."
14:52;14:54;"- New York-y, old Jewish."
14:54;14:57;"- New Jersey-an like voice, really over the top."
14:57;14:58;"Like, I'm like, and then my mom's like,"
14:58;15:00;"""Emma, why did you do that?"""
15:00;15:03;"And people are like, ""Your mom sounds exactly like that."""
15:03;15:04;"- No, but she doesn't sound like that."
15:04;15:05;"- Of course not."
15:05;15:06;"- But you think, now I hear it more."
15:06;15:08;"She does have a slight accent."
15:08;15:09;"- It's subtle."
15:09;15:10;"Dad has more of an accent."
15:10;15:13;"- Is he you playing with the, I don't know."
15:13;15:14;"They don't sound like super New York to me."
15:14;15:15;"Dad is more of an accent."
15:15;15:17;"- That's New Jewish."
15:17;15:18;"- That's a New Jewish accent."
15:18;15:19;"- Neo-Jewish."
15:19;15:23;"Well, I feel like the thing that distinguishes dad's dialect"
15:23;15:27;"is the lack of H's whenever he'll be like,"
15:27;15:29;"""It was a human being."""
15:29;15:29;"- Huge."
15:29;15:31;"- Oh yeah, he's like, dad is like Donald Trump"
15:31;15:32;"'cause he says huge."
15:32;15:35;"It was huge."
15:35;15:37;"And you know one weird thing is,"
15:37;15:39;"this is like so random, it doesn't come up often."
15:39;15:41;"Dad says, ""Gymnast."""
15:41;15:43;"- Well, wait, mom says all these weird words."
15:43;15:46;"She says anorectic for anorexic."
15:46;15:48;"And trauma."
15:48;15:49;"- Trauma?"
15:49;15:51;"- Yeah, for trauma."
15:51;15:53;"She has this very German pronunciation of certain words."
15:53;15:54;"- Oh, trauma?"
15:54;15:56;"Maybe it's 'cause she's a psychotherapist."

19:20;19:23;"because that was his prom theme song."

19:24;19:27;"Was that like mid-70s Frankie Valli?"

19:46;19:49;"because you used to work at Jersey Boys in New York."
19:49;19:51;"- I was an usher for Jersey Boys."
19:51;19:52;"- Which is a musical."
19:52;19:53;"- Which is a musical on Broadway."
19:53;19:55;"I worked at a lot of different Broadway shows,"
19:55;19:57;"but I worked there the most."
19:57;19:59;"So I probably saw it about 80 times."
19:59;20:00;"- Do you love it?"
20:00;20:01;"- I do love it."
20:01;20:03;"- Do you think you could like write"
20:03;20:05;"the whole play from memory?"
20:05;20:07;"- At the time I could've because at a certain point"
20:07;20:10;"I became so bored having seen it so many times"
20:10;20:14;"that I would just memorize like the lighting keys and stuff."
20:14;20:17;"- What is, is an usher in the theater the whole time?"
20:17;20:19;"- Yeah, you hand out the programs"
20:19;20:22;"and then you're there to essentially guard"
20:22;20:23;"against all the rules, you know,"
20:23;20:24;"if people are on their phones"
20:24;20:27;"or taking pictures or talking."
20:27;20:28;"- So you stop people from trying"
20:28;20:29;"to plug in their phones on stage."
20:29;20:31;"- Yes, yes."
20:31;20:33;"- Did anybody ever die at Jersey Boys?"
20:33;20:35;"- What?"
20:35;20:36;"Well, hold on."
20:36;20:38;"- In this story, yes."
20:38;20:40;"No, I think there was one performance"
20:40;20:44;"where someone had some kind of medical emergency"
20:44;20:46;"and they had to stop the show."
20:46;20:47;"- Well, that's what I was thinking of"
20:47;20:49;"because I don't see Broadway plays that often,"
20:49;20:54;"but my friend took me to see ""The Elephant Man,"""
20:54;20:55;"which was a big hit on Broadway last year"
20:55;21:00;"with Bradley Cooper, the American sniper himself."
21:00;21:03;"And kind of towards the end of the play,"
21:03;21:07;"""Elephant Man"" is about to die."
21:07;21:09;"Like he basically goes to get in his bed to die."
21:09;21:11;"And also the whole time, Bradley Cooper,"
21:11;21:13;"he's not wearing any prosthetics or anything."
21:13;21:15;"So he kind of just twists his body"
21:15;21:17;"and makes a lot of noises and goes,"
21:17;21:19;"(gasps)"
21:19;21:20;"""Thank you, sir."""
21:20;21:21;"Like literally for the whole play,"
21:21;21:23;"that's Bradley Cooper's voice."
21:23;21:24;"So he kind of is-"
21:24;21:25;"- He's English?"
21:25;21:27;"- Yeah, the original ""Elephant Man"" was English."
21:27;21:30;"And so Bradley Cooper's doing this hunchback"
21:30;21:31;"and he's walking over to his bed to die"
21:31;21:35;"and he's going, (gasps)"
21:35;21:37;"And then you start to hear this other noise,"
21:37;21:39;"like, (groans)"
21:39;21:42;"And it's like, is that coming from the stage?"
21:42;21:43;"It was literally this moment,"
21:43;21:46;"this really tense moment of him going across the stage."
21:46;21:48;"And then, (groans)"
21:48;21:49;"And he's getting closer to the bed"
21:49;21:51;"and I'm kind of looking around,"
21:51;21:54;"like what is this, some weird surround sound thing?"
21:54;21:55;"And then suddenly a woman stands up"
21:55;21:58;"and is like, ""Oh my God, baby, no!"""
21:58;22:00;"This woman's horrified, she's like weeping."
22:00;22:01;"And then you literally have a full house"
22:01;22:05;"of like four or 500 people just sitting in seats,"
22:05;22:07;"full brightness, while this is going on."
22:07;22:09;"And she's like, ""Is there a doctor?"
22:09;22:10;"""Is there a doctor?"""
22:10;22:11;"And then like a doctor runs over"
22:11;22:12;"and everybody just like sits there."
22:12;22:16;"Bradley Cooper's just like sitting on stage on the bed,"
22:16;22:17;"did not break character,"
22:17;22:19;"but also didn't turn around or do any,"
22:19;22:22;"I mean, I don't know what you do in that scenario."
22:22;22:23;"And then they like very, like some stagehand,"
22:23;22:26;"like very subtly brought like a scrim down"
22:26;22:27;"on the front of the scene,"
22:27;22:29;"but you could still see the actors like frozen up there."
22:29;22:32;"And then like 40 minutes later,"
22:32;22:34;"they get the guy on a stretcher,"
22:34;22:37;"they take him out, it seemed like he was okay."
22:37;22:40;"Oh, and then also the head usher or whatever"
22:40;22:42;"kept coming over the intercom and just be like,"
22:42;22:45;"""An ambulance has been called."""
22:45;22:46;"And just everybody's sitting there"
22:46;22:48;"and it's so weird and uncomfortable."
22:48;22:50;"It seemed like by the time the guy got on the stretcher"
22:50;22:52;"that he was like in good shape and was gonna survive."
22:52;22:55;"And then like literally 30, 40 minutes later,"
22:55;22:59;"bring it down and do like the last four minutes of the play."
22:59;23:02;"Like then Bradley Cooper like dies on stage."
23:02;23:02;"- Wow."
23:02;23:03;"- And that was that."
23:03;23:06;"Anyway, I'm glad that that guy seemed to be okay."
23:06;23:07;"And respect to Bradley Cooper"
23:07;23:09;"for being one of our finest actors."
23:09;23:10;"So here is-"
23:10;23:11;"- I heard he killed that night."
23:11;23:14;"(laughing)"
23:14;23:17;"- And now in honor of the gentleman"
23:17;23:21;"who survived a near-death experience at the theater"
23:21;23:23;"and to Bradley Cooper for being one of our finest actors,"

29:43;29:45;"is gonna walk us through one of his favorite albums"
29:45;29:48;"of all time, Alien Lanes by Guided By Voices."
29:48;29:50;"Emma, have you ever heard of Guided By Voices?"
29:50;29:52;"- I've heard of them."
29:52;29:54;"- Do you know anything about them?"
29:54;29:56;"What do you think they sound like?"
29:56;29:59;"- Uh, I'm the wrong person to ask."
29:59;30:00;"- No, no, you're the right person."
30:00;30:03;"- Oh, because I'm such a novice?"
30:03;30:04;"- No, you're not a novice."
30:04;30:05;"You're just the youngest person in the room."
30:05;30:06;"- Okay."
30:06;30:07;"Guided By Voices--"
30:07;30:09;"- Aside from my little cousin in the corner."
30:09;30:10;"- Hey."
30:10;30:14;"- But, so you're the youngest person in the room."
30:14;30:15;"Do you know Guided By Voices?"
30:15;30:17;"Do you care about rock music?"
30:17;30:22;"- I care, uh, on a macro level about rock music."
30:22;30:23;"Um--"
30:23;30:24;"- What does that mean?"
30:24;30:27;"- Well, I just, I don't know a lot of the minutia."
30:27;30:30;"I don't know a lot of the data about music."
30:30;30:32;"But I think it's important."
30:32;30:34;"- When people ask you, like, what kind of music do you like,"
30:34;30:35;"what do you say?"
30:35;30:36;"- I usually pass out."
30:36;30:38;"- Everything but country?"
30:38;30:40;"- Jersey boys?"
30:40;30:42;"- Musicals?"
30:42;30:46;"I usually just say, like, Liz Phair and Elvis Costello."
30:46;30:48;"- And you've been saying that for 15 years?"
30:48;30:50;"- For like 10 to 15 years."
30:50;30:53;"- So what's a typical thing that you would listen to?"
30:53;30:57;"- Um, just friends of mine making music."
30:57;30:58;"That's my go-to."
30:58;30:59;"- Is friends?"
30:59;31:00;"- Yeah."
31:00;31:04;"I feel the most connected to that."
31:04;31:06;"- When it's your friends who made the music?"
31:06;31:08;"- Yes, like my friends who are musicians."
31:08;31:10;"- I totally hear you on that."
31:10;31:11;"- Yeah."
31:11;31:12;"- Yeah, friend rock."
31:12;31:13;"- Friend rock."
31:13;31:14;"- Yeah, friend rock."
31:14;31:15;"- That's my genre."
31:15;31:18;"You can always go to the show, give them support."
31:18;31:20;"It doesn't have to be great."
31:20;31:22;"It just has to be about friends."
31:22;31:24;"- Yeah, but are you really going to be listening to it"
31:24;31:27;"when you're driving around or something?"
31:27;31:28;"- Definitely."
31:28;31:29;"- Yeah, okay."
31:29;31:33;"- Well, I'm not very technologically savvy,"
31:33;31:35;"so I still listen to CDs in my car,"
31:35;31:37;"and I've made, like, mixed CDs"
31:37;31:40;"that are just my friends' songs for myself."
31:40;31:41;"- Okay, that's nice."
31:41;31:42;"- You've got to support."
31:42;31:44;"- Well, I know you've got to go,"
31:44;31:46;"but tune in later if you care at all"
31:46;31:48;"about what ""Guided by Voices"" sounds like."
31:48;31:49;"- You might like it."
31:50;31:51;"- I'm very intrigued now."
31:51;31:53;"You've whet my appetite."
31:53;31:55;"- Okay, so please check that out."

35:27;35:29;"Time Crisis"
35:29;35:31;"On Beats 1"
35:31;35:34;"That was Peter, Paul, and Mary with Puff the Magic Dragon."
35:34;35:38;"I don't know, that just feels like a good, kinda sad Sunday song"
35:38;35:40;"to play on Time Crisis."
35:40;35:42;"How does that song make you guys feel?"
35:42;35:44;"It does remind me of my youth."
35:44;35:47;"There was a cartoon, right? Puff the Magic Dragon?"
35:47;35:49;"Yeah, yeah, I think there was."
35:49;35:54;"And I can see it-- I can't really remember it, but I can see it."
35:54;35:58;"It was some sort of animation with a dragon."
35:58;36:01;"The thing I always think about with that song is, like,"
36:01;36:06;"why is there so much stuff for children that's about childhood ending?"
36:06;36:09;"There's Puff the Magic Dragon, then there's The Giving Tree."
36:09;36:11;"Do you remember that book, Shel Silverstein?"
36:11;36:12;"Oh, sure."
36:12;36:14;"That's basically the same thing."
36:14;36:17;"It's about a tree that this boy--"
36:17;36:19;"it's in the boy's life the whole time,"
36:19;36:25;"and the tree gives him apples and a place to hang out and a place to play."
36:25;36:31;"And then the boy grows up and literally murders the thing that provided him joy."
36:31;36:35;"It's just a metaphor for any childhood."
36:35;36:40;"Resource exploitation, job creator."
36:40;36:42;"It's brutal."
36:42;36:44;"But also, these are for kids."
36:44;36:48;"It's not like these are books for an adult."
36:48;36:50;"How do you process the passing of time?"
36:50;36:54;"This is literally for children that's saying, ""Buckle up."
36:54;36:59;"All this s--t that's meaningful to you now, you're going to murder it,"
36:59;37:02;"and you're going to hate it, and you're going to make it really sad."""
37:02;37:04;"Dreams die."
37:04;37:08;"Your imagination will crumble and become brittle."
37:08;37:11;"But is that important? I guess that's important for children to learn."
37:11;37:16;"There's one other song that I feel kind of exists in this category"
37:16;37:19;"that's also got that kind of melancholy growing up vibe."
37:19;37:22;"This is the only other one that I can think of that was a hit song."
37:22;37:25;"This is Harry Chapin, ""Cats in the Cradle."""
37:25;37:26;"Brutal."
37:26;37:28;"Terrible."
37:39;37:42;"My child arrived just the other day"
37:42;37:45;"He came to the world in the usual way"
37:45;37:49;"But there were planes to catch and bills to pay"
37:49;37:51;"He learned to walk while I was away"
37:51;37:53;"And he was talking 'fore I knew it"
37:53;37:58;"And as he grew, he'd say, ""I'm gonna be like you, Dad"

38:09;38:12;"When you're coming home, Dad, I don't know when"
38:12;38:15;"But we'll get together then"
38:15;38:19;"You know we'll have a good time then"
38:27;38:30;"My son turned ten just the other day"
38:30;38:33;"He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play"
38:33;38:36;"Can you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today"
38:36;38:39;"I got a lot to do"" He said, ""That's okay"""
38:39;38:42;"And then he walked away but his smile never dimmed"
38:42;38:45;"And said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah"
38:45;38:50;"You know I'm gonna be like him"""
38:50;38:53;"And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon"

39:02;39:06;"You know we'll have a good time then"
39:14;39:17;"I came from college just the other day"
39:17;39:20;"So much like a man, I just had to say"
39:20;39:23;"""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?"""
39:23;39:26;"He shook his head and he said with a smile"
39:26;39:30;"""What I'd really like, Dad, is the bar or the car keys"
39:30;39:34;"See you later, can I have them, please?"""
39:34;39:37;"And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon"

39:58;40:01;"I've long since retired, my son's moved away"
40:01;40:05;"I called him up just the other day"
40:05;40:08;"I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind"""
40:08;40:12;"He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time"""
40:12;40:15;"You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids are the flu"
40:15;40:18;"But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad"
40:18;40:23;"It's been sure nice talking to you"
40:23;40:26;"And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me"
40:26;40:29;"He'd grown up just like me"
40:29;40:34;"My boy was just like me"
40:34;40:37;"And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon"

40:46;40:50;"We're gonna have a good time then"
40:53;40:55;"That was Harry Chapin with Cats in the Cradle."
40:55;40:57;"So I guess that song is almost like--"
40:57;40:59;"that song is basically like Puff the Magic Dragon"
40:59;41:02;"or The Giving Tree, just without the metaphor."
41:02;41:06;"It's like straight up about a parent and a child growing up"
41:06;41:09;"and not really having time for the person that nurtured you."
41:09;41:11;"The most rote, sentimental--"
41:11;41:12;"Oh, you don't like this song?"
41:12;41:13;"It's terrible."
41:13;41:14;"Really?"
41:14;41:15;"Oh, God, I hate that song."
41:15;41:17;"I thought you'd like it 'cause it's from the '70s."
41:17;41:19;"I mean, I like the palette of the song, sonically."
41:19;41:20;"You like the sonic palette?"
41:20;41:21;"But, like, it's just like--"
41:21;41:25;"Yeah, I don't remember it being such a tasty little bass line."
41:25;41:28;"Yeah, it actually sounds kind of good, just like arrangement-wise."
41:28;41:29;"Yeah, I don't remember."
41:29;41:31;"I just remember it being this song"
41:31;41:34;"about the pains of childhood and fatherhood."
41:34;41:38;"Also, I feel like there's no songs that are hit songs like this"
41:38;41:40;"in 2015."
41:40;41:41;"You know what I mean?"
41:41;41:44;"It's so '70s that there'd be a hit song"
41:44;41:48;"by a singer-songwriter about your relationship with your parents."
41:48;41:50;"Not that people don't write those songs today,"
41:50;41:52;"but just this is a hit song."
41:52;41:53;"Yeah."
41:53;41:55;"Do you remember that song by Mike and the Mechanics,"
41:55;41:56;"The Living Years?"
41:56;41:58;"Oh, yeah, that's also about a dad."
41:58;42:01;"Which is a super heavy song about a son"
42:01;42:04;"who's reflecting on his recently passed father."
42:04;42:05;"Oh, yeah."
42:05;42:06;"And how he--"
42:06;42:09;"That's a really good song, and that was a hit song."
42:09;42:10;"Maybe we should hit that."
42:10;42:11;"Yeah, we should hit that."
42:11;42:12;"That's a good song."
42:12;42:15;"[MUSIC - THE MECHANICS, ""THE LIVING YEARS""]"
42:15;42:30;"Every generation blames the one before."
42:30;42:40;"And all of their frustrations come beating on your door."
42:40;42:45;"I know that I'm a prisoner to all my fatherhouse, oh, dear."
42:45;42:49;"I know that I'm a hostage to all his hopes and fears."
42:49;42:55;"I just wish I could have told him in the living years."
42:59;43:09;"Oh, crumpled bits of paper filled with imperfect thoughts"
43:09;43:14;"still to conversations."
43:14;43:19;"I'm afraid that's all we've got."
43:19;43:22;"You say you just don't see it."
43:22;43:24;"He says it's perfect sense."
43:24;43:28;"You just can't get agreement in this present tense."
43:28;43:34;"We all talk a different language, talking in defense."

43:57;44:00;"It's too late."
44:00;44:02;"It's too late."
44:02;44:05;"When we die."
44:05;44:07;"Oh, when we die."
44:07;44:09;"Too early."
44:09;44:14;"We don't see eye to eye."
44:14;44:25;"So we open up a quarrel between the present and the past."
44:26;44:32;"We only sacrifice the future."
44:32;44:37;"It's the bitterness that lasts."
44:37;44:40;"So don't give to the fortunes."
44:40;44:45;"Sometimes these fates, it may have a new perspective"
44:45;44:47;"on a different day."

44:53;44:56;"Safe life."
44:59;45:02;"Safe and clean."
45:02;45:05;"Oh, safe and clean."
45:05;45:13;"You can be so as well as you need."
45:13;45:16;"Because it's too late."
45:16;45:18;"It's too late."
45:20;45:23;"When we die."
45:23;45:25;"Oh, when we die."
45:25;45:28;"Too early."
45:28;45:32;"We don't see eye to eye."
45:32;45:43;"I wasn't there that morning when my father passed away."
45:46;45:56;"I didn't get to tell him all the things I had to say."
45:56;46:01;"I think I caught his spirit later that same year."
46:01;46:06;"I'm sure I heard his echo in my baby's newborn tears."
46:06;46:14;"I just wish I could have told him in the living years."
46:14;46:17;"So safe, safe, safe life."
46:17;46:20;"Safe life."
46:20;46:22;"Safe and clean."
46:22;46:25;"Oh, safe and clean."
46:25;46:34;"You can be so as well as you need."

47:02;47:04;"Safe and clean."
47:04;47:06;"That was Mike and the Mechanic with the Living Years."
47:06;47:08;"I feel like over the past 15, 20 minutes,"
47:08;47:11;"we've kind of covered the entire life cycle."
47:11;47:15;"Growing up, moving away, becoming an adult,"
47:15;47:17;"dealing with death."
47:17;47:20;"It's nice that we can do all that with pop music."
47:20;47:22;"Maybe we should brighten things up."
47:22;47:24;"Maybe it's time to get into some guided by voices."
47:24;47:26;"We ready for a rock block with Jake?"
47:26;47:27;"Yeah, man, let's do it."
47:27;47:32;"Time Crisis with Ezra Kanin."
47:32;47:35;"All right, so first of all, we've had you on this show"
47:35;47:36;"make a cameo."
47:36;47:39;"We've had you on this show make a case for the Grateful Dead,"
47:39;47:41;"make a case for the Eagles."
47:41;47:43;"A lot of young kids think those bands are trash."
47:43;47:45;"Some kids don't think they're trash."
47:45;47:47;"I would venture to say that no young kids think"
47:47;47:50;"guided by voices are trash because they're not familiar"
47:50;47:51;"with guided by voices."
47:51;47:52;"Yeah, I don't know."
47:52;47:53;"I mean--"
47:53;47:55;"I know I'm going to get some kid on Twitter who says"
47:55;47:56;"guided by voice is my favorite band."
47:56;47:57;"I'm sure."
47:57;47:58;"Or they're my dad."
47:58;47:59;"What?"
47:59;48:01;"A kid on Twitter might say Robert Pollard's my dad."
48:01;48:02;"Oh, yeah, Kevin Pollard."
48:02;48:05;"This is going to be like, ""Fuck you, man."""
48:05;48:08;"No, first of all, I have nothing against guided by voices."
48:08;48:11;"I think guided by voices are a cool band."
48:11;48:15;"But they're interesting because they remind us so much"
48:15;48:18;"of this kind of like vanished world."
48:18;48:19;"You know what I mean?"
48:19;48:22;"It's like the guided by voices, it's like art from"
48:22;48:24;"Vienna in the '20s, you know?"
48:24;48:26;"Like vanished world."
48:26;48:31;"Do you mean like DIY '90s indie rock recorded on a four track?"
48:31;48:33;"I mean like pre-internet."
48:33;48:34;"Right."
48:34;48:35;"They're regional because where are they from?"
48:35;48:36;"Ohio?"
48:36;48:37;"Dayton, Ohio, yeah."
48:37;48:39;"There's something about them being like this regional band"
48:39;48:43;"that built a cult following very slowly through touring."
48:43;48:44;"I mean--"
48:44;48:45;"Well, yeah."
48:45;48:49;"I feel like they're the classic college rock band, right?"
48:49;48:52;"Yeah, and college rock totally fell apart with the student"
48:52;48:54;"loan crisis, so that's over."
48:54;48:55;"Bye, college rock."
48:55;48:57;"So why don't you explain to us who are guided by voices"
48:57;48:59;"and what do they mean to you?"
48:59;49:01;"Okay, well, they're one of my favorite bands for sure"
49:01;49:05;"and definitely my favorite band from that era of the '90s."
49:05;49:07;"We're talking '90s indie rock, Matador Records,"
49:07;49:09;"that kind of thing."
49:09;49:12;"They were formed in Dayton, Ohio in the early '80s."
49:12;49:15;"This guy named Bob Pollard is the primary songwriter and singer"
49:15;49:19;"and they released a lot of-- they released like five albums"
49:19;49:23;"in utter obscurity in the '80s, meaning they would record"
49:23;49:26;"a record at a little recording studio or at home and then"
49:26;49:28;"press 500 copies and that was kind of the deal."
49:28;49:31;"And then some of their records started to get to cool people"
49:31;49:32;"in New York."
49:32;49:36;"I know that Matt Sweeney was an early big fan of theirs"
49:36;49:38;"and sort of like went to bat for them."
49:38;49:39;"He was in the band Chavez?"
49:39;49:40;"Yeah."
49:40;49:41;"Right."
49:41;49:43;"And so like some of the records they were making in the early '90s"
49:43;49:46;"sort of got into hands of cool tastemaker people in New York."
49:46;49:49;"They released a record in '94 called B-1000,"
49:49;49:52;"and at that point Bob Pollard was like 36."
49:52;49:56;"He'd been teaching fourth grade for about 12 years."
49:56;50:02;"So unusually old to suddenly become the toast of big city music people."
50:02;50:07;"I remember the first time I saw them live, it was in '96, '97,"
50:07;50:10;"and it was before the internet was really a thing."
50:10;50:13;"I wasn't in the habit of Googling bands or watching videos on YouTube."
50:13;50:18;"So I had no idea what they even looked like or how they were live."
50:18;50:19;"And I remember listening to these records."
50:19;50:20;"That's crazy."
50:20;50:22;"Yeah, so I remember listening to these records and they were sort of"
50:22;50:27;"like lo-fi homemade records, so I just kind of assumed that live"
50:27;50:34;"they would be sort of like shoegazy, pretty introverted, kind of mellow show."
50:34;50:38;"And then when I got to the show, it was like this crazy rock show."
50:38;50:40;"Did you ever see them live, Ethan?"
50:40;50:44;"Yeah, but probably not until mid-2000s."
50:44;50:45;"Okay, yeah."
50:45;50:48;"So I remember going and not even knowing who Bob Pollard was,"
50:48;50:51;"and then he just came out on stage, and he didn't even play guitar."
50:51;50:55;"He just sang, which in the context of indie rock in the mid-'90s"
50:55;51:00;"was kind of a crazy move to just go out there and just be singing"
51:00;51:04;"and twirling the mic like he's Roger Daltrey or something."
51:04;51:06;"And so I think they're great records."
51:06;51:12;"There's this really savvy relationship between their recorded output"
51:12;51:16;"and their live performance of those songs was really, really different."
51:16;51:17;"Where should we start?"
51:17;51:20;"Alien Lands, Guided by Voices, this is one of their big albums, 1995."
51:20;51:22;"Yeah, this is maybe my favorite record of theirs."
51:22;51:24;"It was released in '95."
51:24;51:25;"Let's start with Game of Pricks."
51:25;51:27;"I mean, that's one of my favorite songs."
51:27;51:28;"I love this recording."
51:28;51:32;"If I imagine what a band would sound like playing in a garage"
51:32;51:35;"and they somehow perfectly recorded it and encapsulated it,"
51:35;51:36;"that's what it sounds like to me."
51:36;51:39;"I don't know if this is a boombox recording or a four-track recording"
51:39;51:41;"made to sound like a boombox recording."
51:41;51:45;"Bob's voice is really sweet and high, and I love this recording."
51:45;51:47;"All right, let's check it out, Game of Pricks."

54:55;54:57;"A couple of tracks from ""Guided by Voices"" ""Alien Lanes"""
54:57;54:59;"So these are very short songs"
54:59;55:02;"Yeah, it's a 41 minute album"
55:02;55:04;"And it's 28 tracks"
55:04;55:07;"So most of the songs are under 2 minutes"
55:07;55:09;"And some of them are, you know, 30 seconds or 40 seconds"
55:09;55:11;"We should play some of those too, for sure"
55:11;55:14;"And it's definitely like the way the album is compiled"
55:14;55:18;"I think they had been recording this music at home pretty quickly"
55:18;55:22;"Then amassed like a ton of music and then added it down to a record"
55:22;55:25;"And there's no spaces between the songs"
55:25;55:27;"It just sort of is like one after another"
55:27;55:28;"Yeah"
55:28;55:29;"No pauses"

01:14:44;01:14:51;"Mama said it was a shame about Billy Joe anyhow."
01:14:51;01:14:59;"Seems like nothing ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge."
01:14:59;01:15:08;"And now Billy Joe McAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge."
01:15:08;01:15:15;"My brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billy Joe"
01:15:15;01:15:23;"put a frog down my back at the Carroll County Picture Show."
01:15:23;01:15:31;"And wasn't I talking to him after church last Sunday night?"
01:15:31;01:15:39;"""You got another piece of apple pie? You know it don't seem right."""
01:15:39;01:15:46;"I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge."
01:15:46;01:15:55;"And now you tell me Billy Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge."
01:15:55;01:16:02;"Mama said to me, ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?"""
01:16:02;01:16:10;"""I've been cooking all morning and you haven't touched a single bite."""
01:16:10;01:16:18;"That nice young preacher brother Taylor dropped by today."
01:16:18;01:16:26;"He said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday. Oh, by the way."
01:16:26;01:16:33;"He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge."
01:16:33;01:16:41;"And she and Billy Joe was throwing something off the Tallahatchie Bridge."
01:16:41;01:16:49;"A year has come and gone since we heard the news about Billy Joe."
01:16:49;01:16:56;"Brother married Becky Thompson. They bought a store in Tupelo."
01:16:56;01:17:04;"There was a virus going 'round. Papa caught it and he died last spring."
01:17:04;01:17:12;"And now Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything."
01:17:12;01:17:20;"And me, I spend a lot of time picking flowers up on Choctaw Ridge."
01:17:20;01:17:27;"And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge."
01:17:33;01:17:38;"That was Bobby Gentry with ""Ode to Billy Joel."" A number one hit from 1967."
01:17:38;01:17:39;"Kind of a weird song."
01:17:39;01:17:40;"Top 40?"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"Yeah, Billboard Hot 100."
01:17:42;01:17:43;"Wow."
01:17:43;01:17:46;"Number one. There's a lot of unanswered questions in this song."
01:17:46;01:17:50;"Times have really changed if that was a number one song."
01:17:50;01:17:56;"I mean, you know, she's coming out of country music, so I think that helped to ground the song."
01:17:56;01:18:00;"You know, it's like a story. It's a classic country story song, but with kind of a vibe-y production."
01:18:00;01:18:03;"You guys know this song, Skeeter Davis, ""The End of the World""?"
01:18:03;01:18:05;"Maybe. I don't think so."
01:18:05;01:18:14;"You'll probably recognize it. It's like she came out of country, but this song, it doesn't sound particularly country."
01:18:14;01:18:19;"It's got a little bit almost of that early Elvis kind of flavor, like an Elvis ballad."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"It's got a great lyrical conceit."
01:18:21;01:18:23;"And Elvis would cross over a lot."
01:18:23;01:18:27;"Yeah, so this is right on that kind of, right in that line between pop and country."
01:18:27;01:18:33;"So this is a song about a broken heart, and it's about, it's everything about in the song is kind of like,"
01:18:33;01:18:36;"how come the world keeps going on? Don't they know it's the end of the world?"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"Oh yeah, yeah, this one."
01:18:40;01:18:42;"I gotta take a leak."
01:18:42;01:18:49;"Why does the sun go on shining?"
01:18:49;01:18:56;"Why does the sea rush to shore?"
01:18:56;01:19:02;"Don't they know it's the end of the world?"
01:19:02;01:19:09;"'Cause you don't love me anymore."
01:19:09;01:19:16;"Why do the birds go on singing?"
01:19:16;01:19:23;"Why do the stars glow above?"
01:19:23;01:19:29;"Don't they know it's the end of the world?"
01:19:29;01:19:36;"It ended when I lost your love."
01:19:36;01:19:43;"I wake up in the morning and I wonder"
01:19:43;01:19:50;"why everything's the same as it was."
01:19:50;01:19:57;"I can't understand, no I can't understand"
01:19:57;01:20:04;"how life goes on the way it does."
01:20:04;01:20:11;"Why does my heart go on beating?"
01:20:11;01:20:18;"Why do these eyes of mine cry?"
01:20:18;01:20:24;"Don't they know it's the end of the world?"
01:20:24;01:20:32;"It ended when you said goodbye."
01:20:32;01:20:39;"Why does my heart go on beating?"
01:20:39;01:20:46;"Why do these eyes of mine cry?"
01:20:46;01:20:52;"Don't they know it's the end of the world?"
01:20:52;01:21:01;"It ended when you said goodbye."
01:21:16;01:21:24;"And when I see the sign that points one way,"
01:21:24;01:21:32;"the love we used to pass by every day."
01:21:32;01:21:40;"Just walk away, Renee, you won't see me follow you back home."
01:21:40;01:21:48;"The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same."
01:21:48;01:21:54;"You're not to blame."
01:21:54;01:22:02;"From deep inside the tears that I've forced to cry,"
01:22:02;01:22:10;"from deep inside the pain that I chose to hide."
01:22:10;01:22:18;"Just walk away, Renee, you won't see me follow you back home."
01:22:18;01:22:26;"Now as the rain is down upon my weary heart,"
01:22:26;01:22:31;"hold me and cry."
01:22:47;01:22:55;"Just walk away, Renee, you won't see me follow you back home."
01:22:55;01:23:03;"Now as the rain is down upon my weary heart,"
01:23:03;01:23:09;"hold me and cry."
01:23:09;01:23:17;"Young women burn inside her heart upon a wall."
01:23:17;01:23:25;"Still fans away to haunt me, though they're so small."
01:23:25;01:23:33;"Just walk away, Renee, you won't see me follow you back home."
01:23:33;01:23:41;"The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same."
01:23:41;01:23:45;"You're not to blame."
01:23:45;01:23:47;"That was ""The Left Bank"" with ""Just Walk Away, Renee,"""
01:23:47;01:23:50;"a top five single from 1967."
01:23:50;01:23:51;"Top five?"
01:23:51;01:23:54;"Top five. It peaked at five. That still counts, though."
01:23:54;01:23:55;"That's top five."
01:23:55;01:23:59;"Speaking of which, you guys ready to get into this week's top five?"
01:23:59;01:24:06;"It's time for the Top Five on iTunes."
01:24:06;01:24:07;"Pretty ready."
01:24:07;01:24:09;"What is it?"
01:24:09;01:24:12;"Well, Ethan, because you're new to the show."
01:24:12;01:24:16;"Brand new, first time, long time listener, first time listener, actually."
01:24:16;01:24:19;"On Time Crisis, because this show is all about time and crises,"
01:24:19;01:24:24;"we like to play the top five songs on iTunes and just use that as a jumping off point"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"to talk about what's going on in the world."
01:24:26;01:24:30;"We've been listening to quite a few of the same songs all summer."
01:24:30;01:24:33;"I hope there's a few things that are different."
01:24:33;01:24:38;"But let's just go ahead and start out with number five, ""Locked Away,"" ""Our City,"""
01:24:38;01:24:40;"featuring Adam Levine."
01:24:40;01:24:44;"If I got locked away and we lost it all today,"
01:24:44;01:24:49;"tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?"
01:24:49;01:24:54;"If I showed you my flaws, if I couldn't be strong,"
01:24:54;01:25:00;"tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?"
01:25:00;01:25:02;"Right about now."
01:25:02;01:25:06;"If I judged for life, man, would you stay by my side?"
01:25:06;01:25:09;"Or is you gonna say goodbye?"
01:25:09;01:25:12;"Can you tell me right now?"
01:25:12;01:25:14;"If I couldn't buy you a new car--"
01:25:14;01:25:16;"""Our City,"" ""Locked Away,"" featuring Adam Levine."
01:25:16;01:25:19;"Jake, you remember this song from last show?"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"Yeah, a little bit."
01:25:21;01:25:22;"How does it strike you?"
01:25:22;01:25:25;"Do you remember Jamie Foxx telling the whole story about ""Our City"""
01:25:25;01:25:27;"also being known as ""Rock City""?"
01:25:27;01:25:30;"Right, 'cause they're producers, been doing their thing for a minute."
01:25:30;01:25:31;"So you guys like the song?"
01:25:31;01:25:32;"Mm."
01:25:32;01:25:35;"I mean, I like that Adam Levine's on it, L.A. and St. Martin's coming together."
01:25:35;01:25:37;"That's pretty cool."
01:25:37;01:25:39;"I gotta say, you know, going through the top five,"
01:25:39;01:25:41;"maybe the bloom's off the rose."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"In general, or--"
01:25:42;01:25:44;"Maybe you should start doing six through ten."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"On the whole song."
01:25:45;01:25:47;"Maybe we gotta start doing six through ten."
01:25:47;01:25:49;"On the whole segment or just this song?"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"Well, we'll see, we'll see. I don't want to speak too soon."
01:25:51;01:25:52;"Four."
01:25:52;01:25:54;"Maybe the joy of talking about pop music is fading."
01:25:54;01:25:55;"That would be big."
01:25:56;01:25:57;"We'll see. Well, let's keep going."
01:25:57;01:25:59;"This is a song that maybe will get us a little more excited."
01:25:59;01:26:02;"This is a guy having a hell of a summer."
01:26:02;01:26:04;"The Weeknd with ""The Hills."""
01:26:09;01:26:13;"Young man on the road, he doing promo"
01:26:13;01:26:17;"You said keep our business on the low low"
01:26:17;01:26:21;"I'm just trying to get you out the friend zone"
01:26:21;01:26:26;"'Cause you look even better than the photos"
01:26:26;01:26:30;"I can't find your house, send me the info"
01:26:30;01:26:34;"Driving through the gated residential"
01:26:34;01:26:38;"Found out I was coming, sent your friends home"
01:26:38;01:26:42;"Keep on trying to hide it, but your friends know"
01:26:42;01:26:47;"I only call you when it's half past"
01:26:47;01:26:51;"By the only time that I'll be back, so"
01:26:51;01:26:55;"I only love it when you touch me, not feel me"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"The Hills with The Weeknd."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"I just looked up the lyrics for the first time in this song."
01:26:59;01:27:03;"I thought he was saying, ""I only f*** you when it's hot out."""
01:27:03;01:27:05;"Is that what you guys thought it was?"
01:27:05;01:27:07;"I hadn't thought that far, but..."
01:27:07;01:27:09;"What do you think he's saying?"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"I only call you when it's half past five."
01:27:11;01:27:13;"Okay, that's what the actual lyric is."
01:27:13;01:27:17;"I only f*** you when it's hot out"
01:27:17;01:27:22;"I only f*** you when it's hot out"
01:27:22;01:27:25;"Yeah, Dong Strathe, you got a Weeknd impression?"
01:27:25;01:27:28;"I only f*** you when it's hot"
01:27:28;01:27:29;"He likes to sweat."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Like that's his summer girl."
01:27:31;01:27:37;"First of all, this whole thing, some people claim to have seasonal relationships."
01:27:37;01:27:38;"Summer babe."
01:27:38;01:27:41;"Summer fling."
01:27:41;01:27:43;"That song from Grease."
01:27:43;01:27:48;"So I thought, the Hills, I assume he's talking about the Hollywood Hills out here in Los Angeles."
01:27:48;01:27:49;"Definitely."
01:27:49;01:27:52;"And he says some s*** about, ""Oh, you live in the gated residential."""
01:27:52;01:27:54;"So what does this imply about the woman?"
01:27:54;01:27:56;"She's rich."
01:27:56;01:27:57;"She's rich."
01:27:57;01:28:01;"And when it's really hot out, brutal summer,"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"you want to be at a rich person's house or a poor person's house?"
01:28:03;01:28:05;"Rich. They have a pool."
01:28:05;01:28:07;"They have a pool, and what else do they have?"
01:28:07;01:28:08;"Central AC."
01:28:09;01:28:13;"And I'm saying, even if you're down, even if you hate rich people,"
01:28:13;01:28:16;"that time of year, the class struggle is out the window."
01:28:16;01:28:20;"So you're saying that this guy in the song doesn't have AC?"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"Obviously the Weeknd has AC, so I take it back."
01:28:22;01:28:24;"I want to return to Adam Levine."
01:28:24;01:28:26;"I don't even want to talk about Adam Levine anymore."
01:28:26;01:28:28;"He's made a career out of being mild."
01:28:28;01:28:29;"I'm not a fan."
01:28:29;01:28:34;"And when you said it's our city featuring Adam Levine, I had a huge bias."
01:28:34;01:28:36;"And I actually tuned out."
01:28:36;01:28:39;"When you said his name, I was like, ""I'm not even listening to this."""
01:28:39;01:28:40;"Right."
01:28:40;01:28:42;"I hate Maroon 5."
01:28:42;01:28:45;"And that guy is the most mild, uninteresting dude."
01:28:45;01:28:47;"You want to hear some Adam Levine gossip?"
01:28:47;01:28:48;"Yeah."
01:28:48;01:28:52;"I went with my friend recently--I think I was telling Ethan about this the other night--"
01:28:52;01:28:56;"I went with my friend to this hardcore fitness trainer."
01:28:56;01:28:58;"She had an appointment because she knew this guy,"
01:28:58;01:29:01;"and she's like, ""You want to come meet this guy because this guy will drop some knowledge on you."""
01:29:01;01:29:03;"This guy's famous, man."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"He's the guy who got Chris Pratt not fat."
01:29:05;01:29:06;"Okay. Wow."
01:29:06;01:29:12;"This guy was--I'm sitting in his office, listening to him give his spiel to my friend,"
01:29:12;01:29:15;"and I'm looking on the wall, all sorts of celebrities and this and that."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"I don't know if he works with him or he's just seeing him around"
01:29:17;01:29:20;"because people in LA, everybody just sees each other at the gym and stuff."
01:29:20;01:29:23;"And he was just saying, ""Hey, you know who's killing it right now?"""
01:29:23;01:29:24;"I said, ""Who?"""
01:29:24;01:29:26;"And he said, ""Adam Levine."
01:29:26;01:29:28;"He looks better than Brad Pitt in Fight Club."
01:29:28;01:29:32;"He stopped doing yoga, and he started just beefing up and lifting weights."""
01:29:32;01:29:33;"Because he was always in good shape."
01:29:33;01:29:37;"But basically in the fitness community in LA, Adam Levine's body is the talk of the town."
01:29:37;01:29:39;"It's going to make him write better songs."
01:29:39;01:29:42;"Yeah, so does that change how you feel about Maroon 5?"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"No, it confirms everything that I thought."
01:29:44;01:29:45;"I was not making the point that--"
01:29:45;01:29:50;"I'm tired of these guided-by-voices-loving indie dudes who are body-shaming jacked guys."
01:29:50;01:29:51;"Yeah."
01:29:51;01:29:56;"Just because Levine cares about his body more than Bob Pollard doesn't mean he can't make good music."
01:29:56;01:29:58;"Guys, I was off--you know what?"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"I was so out of line."
01:30:00;01:30:01;"All right."
01:30:01;01:30:04;"I want to apologize publicly to you and Adam Levine."
01:30:04;01:30:05;"Thank you."
01:30:05;01:30:08;"Adam Levine, your jacked body is the talk of the town."
01:30:08;01:30:12;"I literally can't go to a gym in LA without hearing about it, so congratulations on that."
01:30:12;01:30:15;"Now here's number three, finally a new song."
01:30:15;01:30:18;"Probably for most of the world, this is not a new song."
01:30:18;01:30:21;"I haven't heard it yet because this was not only just released as a single."
01:30:21;01:30:25;"This is Taylor Swift with ""Wildest Dreams"" from the hit album 1989."
01:30:25;01:30:26;"Number three."
01:30:37;01:30:44;"He said, ""Let's get out of this town, drive out of the city, away from the crowds."""
01:30:44;01:30:47;"I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now."
01:30:47;01:30:49;"Nothing lasts forever."""
01:30:49;01:30:52;"But this is gonna take me down."
01:30:52;01:30:55;"He's so tall and handsome as hell."
01:30:55;01:30:58;"He's so bad, but he does it so well."
01:30:58;01:31:01;"I can see the end as it begins."
01:31:01;01:31:05;"My one condition is--"
01:31:05;01:31:12;"Say you'll remember me, standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe."
01:31:12;01:31:14;"Bad lips and nosy cheeks."
01:31:14;01:31:21;"Say you'll see me again, even if it's just in your wildest dreams."
01:31:21;01:31:26;"Wildest dreams."
01:31:26;01:31:34;"Wildest dreams."
01:31:34;01:31:38;"So ""Wildest Dreams,"" Jake, what do you think about this song?"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"I don't even know, man."
01:31:40;01:31:41;"I mean--"
01:31:41;01:31:43;"Okay, do you know who Taylor Swift is?"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"Of course I know who Taylor Swift is."
01:31:45;01:31:47;"What's your favorite Taylor Swift song?"
01:31:47;01:31:52;"I don't know, she's like, ""Starbucks lovers, and we go to the Office Depot."""
01:31:52;01:31:53;"And then we only have--"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"""And we go to Starbucks, now."""
01:31:55;01:31:59;"I mean, this album, I guess, is basically like our ""Born in the USA"" now."
01:31:59;01:32:00;"How is that the case?"
01:32:00;01:32:06;"I think in a way that maybe ""Born in the USA"" was about kind of like Reagan destroying America."
01:32:06;01:32:10;"That 1989 is Taylor talking about Obama destroying America."
01:32:10;01:32:12;"Okay, so she's pretty right wing."
01:32:12;01:32:14;"No, I'm just kidding."
01:32:14;01:32:16;"We have no reason to believe that Taylor Swift is right wing."
01:32:16;01:32:17;"She's never claimed that."
01:32:17;01:32:19;"Jake, you're in the doghouse on this episode, man."
01:32:19;01:32:23;"You're just taking down Sacred Cow's left, right, and center, my friend."
01:32:23;01:32:24;"I wasn't taking her down, man."
01:32:24;01:32:31;"Moving on to number two, it's our old friend of the weekend, still holding strong, with ""I Can't Feel My Face."""
01:32:31;01:32:35;"And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb"
01:32:35;01:32:40;"And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come"
01:32:40;01:32:44;"But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young"
01:32:44;01:32:48;"This I know, this I know"
01:32:48;01:32:52;"She told me don't worry about it"
01:32:52;01:32:57;"She told me don't worry no more"
01:32:57;01:33:01;"We both know we can't go without it"
01:33:01;01:33:07;"She told me you'll never be alone"
01:33:07;01:33:11;"I can't feel my face when I'm with you"
01:33:11;01:33:16;"But I love it, but I love it"
01:33:16;01:33:20;"I can't feel my face when I'm with you"
01:33:20;01:33:25;"But I love it, but I love it"
01:33:25;01:33:29;"Okay, this is a huge song, ""I Can't Feel My Face."""
01:33:29;01:33:36;"It's almost sad how these really great songs eventually just become like wallpaper."
01:33:36;01:33:38;"I guess that's what the summer's all about."
01:33:38;01:33:41;"We heard this song for the first time early on in ""Time Crisis."""
01:33:41;01:33:45;"It's funky, lyrically interesting, beautiful voice."
01:33:45;01:33:49;"And now, no fault of the weekends, but now it's just wallpaper."
01:33:49;01:33:51;"That's the journey of art, Ezra."
01:33:51;01:33:52;"What do you mean?"
01:33:52;01:33:57;"Well, the year after Jackson Pollock made those crazy splatter paintings,"
01:33:57;01:34:02;"they were used as a backdrop for a photo shoot in Vogue."
01:34:02;01:34:04;"So they were literally wallpaper."
01:34:04;01:34:06;"The weekend is killing it. It's amazing."
01:34:06;01:34:09;"I heard his performance at the VMAs last week was incredible."
01:34:09;01:34:11;"I missed that part of the VMAs."
01:34:11;01:34:13;"I only f--- you when it's hot out"
01:34:13;01:34:16;"You got AC, I'm lonely when I'm with me"
01:34:16;01:34:19;"And I'm the wind and the moon in my scene"
01:34:19;01:34:22;"You guys ready for the number one song on iTunes now?"
01:34:22;01:34:23;"What is it? I have no idea."
01:34:23;01:34:24;"It's finally something new."
01:34:24;01:34:26;"I have no idea what it is, honestly."
01:34:26;01:34:28;"It's by a guy called Justin Bieber, another Canadian."
01:34:28;01:34:29;"Who's that?"
01:34:29;01:34:31;"All right, let's give it a listen. Justin Bieber, ""What Do You Mean?"""
01:34:45;01:34:47;"What do you mean?"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Oh, oh, oh"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"When you nod your head yes"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"But you wanna say no"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"What do you mean?"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"Hey, yeah"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"When you don't want me to move"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"But you tell me to go"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"What do you mean?"
01:35:03;01:35:07;"Oh, what do you mean?"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"Since you're running out of time"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"What do you mean?"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"Oh, oh, oh"
01:35:13;01:35:14;"What do you mean?"
01:35:14;01:35:15;"Pan flutes?"
01:35:15;01:35:16;"Mm."
01:35:16;01:35:18;"What do you mean?"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"You like those pan flutes, Jake?"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"Yeah."
01:35:22;01:35:24;"Well, I gotta say, this is very tasteful."
01:35:24;01:35:28;"I think he's been writing a lot with Pooh Bear."
01:35:28;01:35:31;"Who's one of the biggest writers in the game right now."
01:35:31;01:35:33;"I don't know that much about pop music."
01:35:33;01:35:35;"You don't?"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"Yeah, who am I kidding? I know how the sausage gets made."
01:35:37;01:35:39;"[Laughter]"
01:35:39;01:35:40;"I've been in these rooms."
01:35:40;01:35:41;"You know what I would imagine?"
01:35:41;01:35:44;"Is 'cause like, I feel like everybody has something to say about how pop music gets made."
01:35:44;01:35:48;"First of all, who cares if one pop star wrote something and another pop star didn't?"
01:35:48;01:35:51;"Does writing a hit song make you a good person? I don't know."
01:35:51;01:35:52;"Elvis didn't write anything."
01:35:52;01:35:54;"Elvis didn't write anything and he was a horrible person."
01:35:54;01:35:56;"[Audience booing]"
01:35:56;01:36:00;"The way I imagine this song probably got made is a lot of people always want to say,"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"""Did Justin Bieber write a song?"""
01:36:02;01:36:04;"And I definitely see a lot of people be like, ""There's no way he wrote it."""
01:36:04;01:36:06;"You know what? I bet he did write some."
01:36:06;01:36:08;"Yeah. Some of these lyrics sound like he might have written."
01:36:08;01:36:09;"Absolutely."
01:36:09;01:36:15;"That just sounds like the older Swedish man and the younger American producer sat Justin down,"
01:36:15;01:36:17;"said, ""What's going on in your love life?"""
01:36:17;01:36:20;"And Justin was just like, ""This girl, I never know what she means."
01:36:20;01:36:23;"Sometimes she wants to do this, sometimes she wants to do that."
01:36:23;01:36:24;"What does she mean?"""
01:36:24;01:36:27;"And the guys are like, ""Ah, what do you mean? Let's go."""
01:36:27;01:36:28;"♪ What do you mean? ♪"
01:36:28;01:36:33;"I guess I would argue that the overall song is pretty ambient."
01:36:33;01:36:35;"And I'm hearing new age pipes."
01:36:35;01:36:38;"Which I want him to further explore."
01:36:38;01:36:40;"You know what I'm talking about? The [imitates pipe sound]"
01:36:40;01:36:42;"That's pipe music."
01:36:42;01:36:43;"Pan flute."
01:36:44;01:36:46;"Well, look, this guy's been in the game five, six years."
01:36:46;01:36:47;"He's seen a lot of ups and downs."
01:36:47;01:36:49;"Maybe he's finding his spirituality."
01:36:49;01:36:52;"He had the classic story. Young, evangelical Christian kid."
01:36:52;01:36:53;"Oh, really?"
01:36:53;01:36:54;"Yeah, yeah."
01:36:54;01:36:58;"Kind of like, I don't know, rural, suburban, maybe more like suburban."

01:37:14;01:37:16;"Back up? What are you talking about?"
01:37:16;01:37:17;"Did he actually pee in a bucket?"
01:37:17;01:37:18;"Yeah, he famously peed in a bucket."
01:37:18;01:37:20;"I missed that one. What happened?"
01:37:20;01:37:23;"He peed in a bucket backstage at a club and somebody--"
01:37:23;01:37:24;"Why is that a thing?"
01:37:24;01:37:26;"Like in a bucket of ice? Like a champagne bucket?"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"Because we live in a celebrity-obsessed culture."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"You know that, uh, what's her name?"
01:37:30;01:37:35;"Ariana Grande was caught on video licking donuts at a donut place like a month ago?"
01:37:35;01:37:38;"Well, that's weird. Licking them and putting them back?"
01:37:38;01:37:42;"Yeah, yeah. She licked them and they were like out on the counter and she just like licked them."
01:37:42;01:37:43;"Or maybe she spit on them."
01:37:43;01:37:44;"That's gnarly."
01:37:44;01:37:48;"Peeing in a bucket backstage is like, seems like pretty par for the course."
01:37:48;01:37:51;"Well, either way, I just hate how we like build people up and tear them down."
01:37:51;01:37:56;"Like, when you were like in your early 20s, did you never go to a donut place and just like lick them?"
01:37:56;01:37:58;"Or like pee in a bucket somewhere?"
01:37:58;01:38:01;"Yes, peed in a bucket, did not lick donuts. I'm drawing a distinction."
01:38:01;01:38:07;"My friend in college peed into a pitcher of beer and served it to some strangers."
01:38:07;01:38:09;"I'll never forget that. I was shocked."
01:38:09;01:38:10;"Okay, that's horrifying."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"That's insane."
01:38:11;01:38:15;"On the spectrum of horrible things a young person could do, I think we put them in order."
01:38:15;01:38:18;"The least bad thing is peeing in a bucket, the second worst is licking a donut."
01:38:18;01:38:19;"Yeah."
01:38:19;01:38:22;"And the third worst is serving your urine."
01:38:22;01:38:23;"Out of the pitcher."
01:38:23;01:38:25;"To other people. Who knows what pop stars are doing that?"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"That's for sure the order of those three."
01:38:27;01:38:29;"That's like a Motley Crue move."
01:38:29;01:38:33;"You know, actually, just hearing you say that, it sends a chill up my spine because I realize"
01:38:33;01:38:39;"how many of these pop stars are doing things like that, making people drink things that they shouldn't be drinking."
01:38:39;01:38:40;"It's horrifying."
01:38:40;01:38:44;"My friend wasn't even a pop star at the time. He was just a kid in college."
01:38:44;01:38:46;"I know, but it really makes me think back."
01:38:46;01:38:48;"We were talking about Adam Levine earlier."
01:38:48;01:38:49;"Who knows what he's doing, man?"
01:38:49;01:38:53;"He's working out and keeping his body tight, looking better than Brad Pitt in Fight Club."
01:38:53;01:38:55;"First of all, I don't buy that."
01:38:55;01:38:57;"No one looks better than Brad Pitt in Fight Club."
01:38:57;01:39:00;"No, he's got those divots or whatever."
01:39:00;01:39:02;"He's got the lines. He's got the V."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"Levine's too old to pull that off."
01:39:04;01:39:06;"He ain't licking any donuts if he's got the V."
01:39:06;01:39:07;"You know what?"
01:39:07;01:39:08;"Let's go back to Bieber."
01:39:08;01:39:09;"Okay, sorry. I just want to say one other thing."
01:39:09;01:39:16;"It disgusts me that people would give the weekend a hard time for just singing about making love to multiple different women in one night."
01:39:16;01:39:21;"When you compare that to licking a donut or serving your urine to your friends."
01:39:21;01:39:25;"No, no, no. That's not... You got to get the story right."
01:39:25;01:39:28;"He p****d into the pitcher."
01:39:28;01:39:30;"When you compare..."
01:39:30;01:39:31;"This guy has two kids now, by the way."
01:39:31;01:39:35;"When you compare..."
01:39:35;01:39:38;"He filled a pitcher with urine and then served it to people."
01:39:38;01:39:44;"And you would turn around and as the lead singer of a big band like Maroon 5, people look up to you."
01:39:44;01:39:45;"You're on The Voice."
01:39:45;01:39:50;"And you would turn around and serve a pitcher of your urine to a bunch of college kids in North Carolina."
01:39:50;01:39:52;"I mean, how could you even put those things on..."
01:39:52;01:39:55;"You know what? What is this sexual conservatism?"
01:39:55;01:39:57;"Adam Levine's supposed to be a role model."
01:39:57;01:40:00;"And you know what? I was big-upping him before because he's in great shape."
01:40:00;01:40:11;"But I'm sorry. It disgusts me that he would take advantage of a bunch of college students in North Carolina and pull a disgusting prank like that."
01:40:11;01:40:13;"I imagine nobody got too sick."
01:40:13;01:40:15;"But what if they had?"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"It's a psychological damage."
01:40:17;01:40:20;"Every pitcher of beer you've ever ordered..."
01:40:20;01:40:22;"I'm not saying it was p****."
01:40:22;01:40:23;"I'm saying it might have been."
01:40:23;01:40:25;"I hate that, man."
01:40:25;01:40:27;"I hate that. How did she get caught?"
01:40:27;01:40:29;"They had a security camera."
01:40:29;01:40:33;"I'm gonna have to start brewing my own beer and baking my own donuts."
01:40:33;01:40:35;"And you know what? I'll probably become a better man because of it."
01:40:35;01:40:37;"Now here's Big Pun with ""It's So Hard."""

01:47:27;01:47:28;"where all the samples come from,"
01:47:28;01:47:30;"a lot of like the classic samples of G-Funk,"

01:48:00;01:48:01;"if you start to throw in Detroit,"

01:48:42;01:48:43;"Is that the theme?"

01:48:46;01:48:48;"one of the richest cities,"
01:48:48;01:48:51;"is that as much as it maybe takes from the Midwest,"
