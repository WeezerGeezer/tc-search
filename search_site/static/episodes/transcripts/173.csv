00:00;00:12;"Time Crisis, back again. Drinking whiskey, eating horse meat, listening to Pearl Jam."
00:12;00:18;"Some and perhaps all of these things will be discussed today. I get together"
00:18;00:25;"with Jake and Seinfeld to hash out culture, life, and love on this week's"
00:25;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:36;00:42;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:42;00:49;"They were a value of me, all my rightful chances."
00:49;00:56;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:56;01:03;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go."
01:03;01:08;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:08;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:13;01:18;"Leave it all in me, babe."
01:18;01:23;"Time Crisis, back again. What's up, Jake?"
01:23;01:28;"Not much, man. Still reeling from our concert experience a few days ago."
01:28;01:32;"Oh yeah, we're going to be talking about this for quite a bit of the show."
01:32;01:35;"I think for months. I mean... I think for months, yeah."
01:35;01:41;"I've had many conversations about this show. The show that we're talking about is Pearl Jam."
01:41;01:47;"Jake and I attended. Shout out to Brian, hooked us up with tickets."
01:47;01:51;"So we rolled to see the first of their two nights at the Forum."
01:51;01:54;"But we got a guest calling in in a little bit, who is also at the show."
01:54;01:58;"So maybe we'll hold off a little bit. Okay, table the PJ discussion."
01:58;02:02;"I'm just... I'm raring to go. Are you still buzzing? Oh yeah."
02:02;02:05;"Alright, well maybe let's do a little bit then."
02:05;02:11;"The first thing I want to say, just as some back story, because I love this story that you told."
02:11;02:17;"Because Pearl Jam is one of these bands that could really break either way for Jake."
02:17;02:20;"I mean, obviously you're going to have your own point of view, but it's like..."
02:20;02:24;"I think I have a pretty good handle on your taste. Okay."
02:24;02:29;"But Pearl Jam is just one of those bands that, obviously I know from talking about you."
02:29;02:34;"But if somebody just said, ""Based on all the information you know about Jake, his taste,"
02:34;02:39;"do you think he likes Pearl Jam?"" I'd be like, ""Damn, that's a straight up 50/50 for me."""
02:39;02:45;"I could totally picture Jake just being like, ""What are you talking about, man? Pearl Jam rules."""
02:45;02:49;"Loved the first three albums, and honestly there's some good sh*t in the next eight."
02:49;02:52;"Always been a fan. Loved them when they came out."
02:52;02:55;"I could see it going that way, and I could also just picture you just being like,"
02:55;03:02;"""Pearl Jam sucks, dude. No, even 10. Never been a fan. Always hated them."""
03:02;03:07;"When I asked if you wanted to come to the concert, I wondered which way it was going to go."
03:07;03:08;"But you were psyched."
03:08;03:14;"Oh yeah. I'd never seen them. I mean, yeah, I'm not a super fan. I think he kind of nailed it."
03:14;03:18;"I mean, it could have been a coin toss with me, with PJ."
03:18;03:23;"Had the first three records in high school, on compact disc."
03:23;03:27;"Listened to them a lot, and then it felt like a different..."
03:27;03:31;"Something, I think because that stuff was early and mid-90s,"
03:31;03:36;"I feel like the first half of the 90s were a different decade than the second half of the 90s."
03:36;03:39;"There was a shift in the vibes."
03:39;03:42;"That's interesting. That was the first vibe shift."
03:42;03:46;"That was a vibe shift. From '94 to '97 is a vibe shift."
03:46;03:48;"Because I feel like Vitalogy was '94."
03:48;03:53;"They came out hot with 10 and 91, versus '92 or '93."
03:53;03:56;"Vitalogy is '94. That's a solid quick run."
03:56;04:00;"And then I feel like they took a break, came back with No Code."
04:00;04:03;"The culture was different. They were different."
04:03;04:06;"And I just, for whatever reason, I wasn't a super fan."
04:06;04:10;"I wasn't anticipating the new PJ by the time it came out."
04:10;04:15;"And they're an interesting band, because when you study their discography,"
04:15;04:21;"as I've referenced before, I recently read an early draft of Stephen Hyden's forthcoming Pearl Jam book."
04:21;04:26;"So I have quite a bit of information still fresh in my mind from that."
04:26;04:30;"But even just in a casual way, because in his book he also notes how"
04:30;04:33;"No Code, their fourth album, was just like this huge turning point."
04:33;04:36;"It also coincided with their Ticketmaster war."
04:36;04:44;"If anybody is not aware, they waged this huge, unwinnable campaign against Ticketmaster,"
04:44;04:49;"standing up for what they believed in, and also for the fans."
04:49;04:54;"I guess they just felt like Ticketmaster charged all this extra money, bummed them out."
04:54;04:58;"They didn't like the monopoly they had on the ticketing business."
04:58;05:01;"And yet, kind of nobody backed them up."
05:01;05:05;"Very few of their peers really wanted to go there."
05:05;05:10;"And then they had to go on a weird patchwork tour where they couldn't play certain venues,"
05:10;05:12;"and the fans were bummed."
05:12;05:16;"So the late 90s was definitely, and certainly the No Code era was difficult for Pearl Jam."
05:16;05:21;"But one interesting thing about them, even when you just casually look at their discography,"
05:21;05:26;"even when you just look at their Wikipedia discography, as I have many times,"
05:26;05:31;"I'm a big Wikipedia discography guy, as I imagine you are, Jake,"
05:31;05:33;"and many people listen to Time Crisis."
05:33;05:40;"Wikipedia discography is a quick and easy way sometimes to get an overview of somebody's career."
05:40;05:43;"And with Pearl Jam, I don't know how accurate these things are,"
05:43;05:48;"but with Pearl Jam, when you look at it, it gives you all the certifications as well,"
05:48;05:52;"which is not the only way, of course, to measure the success of music."
05:52;05:58;"But in Pearl Jam's case, their first album, Ten, was such a monster hit, it went diamond."
05:58;06:00;"Was that 10 million?"
06:00;06:03;"Yeah, it's over 10 million. 10 million or over."
06:03;06:04;"I don't have this at my fingertips."
06:04;06:08;"Seinfeld, maybe you could get a list of how many rock albums went diamond,"
06:08;06:11;"certainly in the 90s on."
06:11;06:20;"You know, for Pearl Jam to go diamond, it truly is just such a level of cultural saturation and success above anything."
06:20;06:25;"Nowadays, it's amazing somebody could sell 100,000 records."
06:25;06:32;"Certainly to go gold or platinum is pretty wild in this era for a rock band."
06:32;06:37;"But to go diamond, that just puts Pearl Jam in this funny league with, I don't know,"
06:37;06:42;"the AC/DCs of the world, The Eagle, the biggest rock bands of all time."
06:42;06:43;"So that's their first album."
06:43;06:48;"And then you just see in the US at least, every album after that kind of drops off a bit,"
06:48;06:49;"which you could expect."
06:49;06:55;"Second album did great, like 7 million. Third album also did great, like 4 million."
06:55;06:56;"They're not all going to go diamond."
06:56;07:02;"But then starting with No Code, they never went more than platinum again."
07:02;07:09;"They kind of entered this cruising altitude of roughly about 10% as many records as they sold on 10."
07:09;07:12;"That's not like a diss, it's just like an interesting type of career."
07:12;07:17;"Many bands, their first album is always going to loom large and perhaps be their biggest."
07:17;07:23;"But there's something pretty wild about just coming out the gate that huge"
07:23;07:32;"and then just kind of by album four settling into this much humbler, mellower place."
07:32;07:36;"And again, maybe to their credit, or I would say to their credit,"
07:36;07:41;"they weren't trying to have their fourth and fifth albums go diamond."
07:41;07:42;"Yes, certainly not."
07:42;07:45;"After the first record, they were defiantly anti-commercial."
07:45;07:48;"Stop making videos, or at least appearing in the videos."
07:48;07:55;"Yeah, to settle into a cruising altitude of platinum. Is that what that is? Is that a million?"
07:55;07:57;"Yeah, platinum is a million, gold is 500,000."
07:57;07:59;"That's cruising altitude."
07:59;08:01;"Oh yeah, absolutely."
08:01;08:08;"Distinctly a different cruising altitude than the massive superstar status of their first album."
08:20;08:30;"She's a empty canvas, untouched she's a clay"
08:30;08:42;"Worldly spread out before me, has her body still"
08:45;08:54;"Oh, five horizons revolve around her song"
08:54;08:57;"As the earth goes on"
08:57;09:06;"Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn"
09:09;09:18;"Oh, and all I taught her was everything"
09:18;09:32;"Oh, I know she gave me all that she wore"
09:34;09:40;"And now my bitter hands are shaped beneath the clouds"
09:40;09:43;"Of what was everything"
09:43;09:46;"All the pictures said"
09:46;09:49;"Old man wants to play"
09:49;09:52;"Tattooed everyday"
09:52;09:55;"And I think you're right. I think it's at least partially by design,"
09:55;09:57;"they really were like doing their thing."
09:57;10:02;"And I think when they entered that zone, they kind of had a real consistency."
10:02;10:07;"I think for like a hardcore PJ fan, every album has something to offer."
10:07;10:13;"And then also one thing about the show is that they're really great at kind of putting a set list together"
10:13;10:19;"where you're going to get like a bunch of the new album, a bunch of songs,"
10:19;10:22;"you know, if you're a casual fan, a bunch of songs, you probably don't know that well,"
10:22;10:27;"but they're always going to space out like the first three album material just when you want it."
10:27;10:30;"Every four songs is a classic."
10:30;10:34;"You're never going to be just like deep in the weeds, just being like, what the hell is this?"
10:34;10:37;"And also, you know, like then you hear these songs that you don't know, but it's cool."
10:37;10:41;"Like there's this kind of like 6/8 kind of like African song in the middle of the set."
10:41;10:43;"It's like, oh, what's this?"
10:43;10:46;"And it's like, oh, it's something from off Gigaton."
10:46;10:49;"I'm only familiar with about half of Gigaton, the new album."
10:49;10:52;"That philosophy of set list, it makes sense."
10:52;10:56;"And it's consistent with their whole ethos of like after the first album,"
10:56;11:03;"they're not going to give everyone candy because they could come out and just do hit after hit after hit like AC/DC or something."
11:03;11:10;"They could just come out and just be like, because like, yeah, there were a bunch of classics that were huge hits that they did not play."
11:10;11:12;"They didn't play Jeremy. They didn't play Daughter."
11:12;11:14;"But I bet they did Night 2."
11:14;11:15;"I looked at the set list."
11:15;11:16;"Oh, yeah."
11:16;11:18;"What did they open with? Night 2, Release, dude."
11:18;11:20;"I kept hoping that we would get Release."
11:20;11:23;"You got to go see them again. Now you're chasing a Release."
11:23;11:25;"Yeah. They played Leash."
11:25;11:30;"I mean, they ended, yeah, they ended Night 2, Jeremy, Leash, Alive, Indifference."
11:30;11:32;"Oh, so they did Alive both nights. Okay."
11:32;11:36;"I think they do Alive every show."
11:36;11:42;"But anyway, yeah, I mean, they could come out and just like melt everyone's faces with just hit after hit."
11:42;11:43;"Not how they roll."
11:43;11:46;"No, but it's very inspiring."
11:46;11:49;"And I'm always interested in looking at Pearl Jam set list."
11:49;11:53;"In fact, that's kind of like somebody, I probably told this story before on the show,"
11:53;11:58;"I remember like early on Father of the Bride era, probably before the album even came out,"
11:58;12:03;"doing some small show somewhere and somebody kind of checking out like the bigger band."
12:03;12:05;"And like we were starting to mix up set list."
12:05;12:08;"I just remember talking to somebody who was like, I see what you guys are doing."
12:08;12:12;"Because at the time, you know, you have people being like, oh, are they trying to be a jam band?"
12:12;12:16;"And I remember I met this dude, I forget where he, he worked in music somehow."
12:16;12:19;"He's a cool guy. And he was just like, all right, I see what you're doing."
12:19;12:22;"He's like, yeah, you're not going, you're not like being like a jam band."
12:22;12:25;"And I was like, no, you know, we have a couple guitar solos and stuff."
12:25;12:28;"How can we go full jam band? It's like not our thing."
12:28;12:36;"I was like, you know, I love the dead, but - and he's like, no, no, you're pulling more from like a Bruce PJ kind of thing."
12:36;12:38;"And then I was like, I talked to him more about like, what do you mean by that?"
12:38;12:39;"He's like, oh, I've seen them a million times."
12:39;12:43;"And I realized what he meant is just putting on a slightly different show every night,"
12:43;12:48;"but like mixing things up within reason, you know?"
12:48;12:53;"I feel like at that show or something, he's like, you guys didn't play Oxford Comma tonight."
12:53;12:55;"And I was like, oh yeah, I guess we didn't."
12:55;12:58;"And he was like, no, but that's cool. You know, he'll play Oxford Comma the next show."
12:58;13:05;"You know, it was one of those things where he was kind of like giving me his interpretation of the PJ Bruce worldview."
13:05;13:12;"And I was like, it totally makes sense because like Pearl Jam is going to give you three or four songs off 10 every night."
13:12;13:21;"And, you know, when I think about like, if Vampire Weekend is ever touring our 12th album, our gigaton."
13:21;13:22;"Stoked."
13:22;13:23;"Oh yeah, it's going to be sick."
13:23;13:28;"But I would still be proud and happy and just like almost kind of relieved to be like, you know,"
13:28;13:33;"if we're doing two nights somewhere in our gigaton era, Baio's like cooking up some first draft setlist,"
13:33;13:36;"like I'd be like, all right, let's do A Punk both nights."
13:36;13:39;"Like let's not f*** around. Let's do A Punk both nights."
13:39;13:44;"Maybe we only do Oxford Comma one night, you know, maybe we only do, you know, Drop A Whore Child."
13:44;13:48;"You know, like start to mix it up. We already started to do it a little bit, but like,"
13:48;13:52;"I like that they have like the right mix of old and new."
13:52;13:57;"It's neither just like, like you said, AC/DC just like, here's like the biggest hits."
13:57;14:03;"Nor is it on some like f*** you s*** that's like, you really want me to play a live?"
14:03;14:05;"That's a different guy you're talking about."
14:05;14:10;"Man, I f***ing wrote that song 30 plus years ago. Do you know how much I've changed?"
14:10;14:14;"No, we're giving you gigaton front to back. Like they're not, it's not that vibe either."
14:14;14:15;"Out of the gates."
14:15;14:17;"We're going to open with the full gigaton album."
14:17;14:23;"And then after that, we're going to do, you know, five songs off a Lightning Bolt."
14:23;14:26;"We're going to dig into four off the Avocado album."
14:26;14:31;"And then if you guys really beg, we'll give you Last Kiss in the encore."
14:31;14:34;"But that's it. That's f***ing it, man."
14:34;14:39;"Where oh where can my baby be?"
14:39;14:43;"The Lord took her away from me"
14:43;14:47;"She's gone to heaven so I've got to be kind"
14:47;14:53;"So I can see my baby when I leave this world"
14:53;15:00;"We were out on a date in my daddy's car"
15:00;15:04;"We hadn't driven very far"
15:04;15:08;"There in the road straight ahead"
15:08;15:12;"A car was stalled and the engine was dead"
15:12;15:16;"I couldn't stop so I swerved to the right"
15:16;15:21;"I'll never forget the sound that night"
15:21;15:25;"The screaming tires, the busting glass"
15:25;15:31;"The painful scream that I heard last night"
15:31;15:36;"There are 39 albums that went diamond in the 1990s."
15:36;15:38;"Oh, across genres."
15:38;15:40;"Across genres."
15:40;15:46;"In the rock genre, there was Nevermind, Nirvana, Kenny G."
15:46;15:49;"Oh, that's not rock. Creed, Human Clay, 1999."
15:49;15:51;"Kenny G rocks, but he's not rock."
15:51;15:52;"There you go."
15:52;15:54;"Creed, Human Clay. Wow, that went diamond?"
15:54;15:56;"Human Clay."
15:56;15:58;"One of the greatest album covers of all time."
15:58;16:02;"Matchbox 20, Yourself or Someone Like You."
16:02;16:04;"That went diamond? Wow."
16:04;16:09;"Other albums, Santana Supernatural, I think that counts."
16:09;16:10;"This is a rough list."
16:10;16:13;"MC Hammer, MC Ed Sink."
16:13;16:15;"But very few rock albums."
16:15;16:18;"Jewel, Pieces of You, is that a rock album? I guess."
16:18;16:21;"Adult Content. No, that's Adult Content."
16:21;16:22;"That's Pop Folk."
16:22;16:25;"Hootie and the Blowfish, Cracked Rearview."
16:25;16:27;"That's rock. That is rock."
16:27;16:30;"Kid Rock, Devil Without a Cause."
16:30;16:32;"Great album. Definitely rock."
16:32;16:34;"Dixie Chicks, The Country."
16:34;16:37;"Anyway, you get the idea."
16:37;16:43;"I'm getting the impression, if we call Hootie and the Blowfish pop rock,"
16:43;16:47;"I would say Matchbox 20, solid, but pop rock."
16:47;16:53;"Rob Thomas, clearly he proved himself, he's a great pop songwriter across genre."
16:53;16:57;"He's just different than Eddie Vedder, just like, dude in a band."
16:57;17:00;"Eddie Vedder was never going to write smooth."
17:00;17:02;"Friend of the show, Alanis Morissette, famously."
17:02;17:05;"Okay, that's rock. That's rock."
17:05;17:10;"But in a way, as far as, she's also a solo artist, that's different."
17:10;17:14;"Maybe I'm cooking the books here, but I'm kind of getting the impression,"
17:14;17:19;"there's only two straight up rock bands who went diamond in the whole 90s."
17:19;17:21;"Nirvana and Pearl Jam."
17:21;17:23;"Well, and Creed."
17:23;17:25;"Creed, dude."
17:25;17:27;"No, no, you're right. I was trying to figure out a way to like..."
17:27;17:28;"Let's not forget Creed."
17:28;17:30;"I was trying to cook the books so that Creed didn't count."
17:30;17:32;"Okay, there's three..."
17:32;17:33;"The new Pearl Jam."
17:33;17:37;"Well, this goes to my, I mean, yeah, this goes to my first half of the 90s,"
17:37;17:39;"it was a different decade than the second half."
17:39;17:41;"The second half was the, I don't know,"
17:41;17:46;"the sad sort of buffoonish cartoonish version of the first half."
17:46;17:48;"And I mean, that's a perfect bookend."
17:48;17:50;"Ten and then Human Clay."
17:50;17:54;"That is so rough."
17:54;17:56;"Matt, let's throw on like some song off Human Clay."
17:56;17:58;"I mean, give me Higher, dude."
17:58;18:00;"Higher is there alive."
18:00;18:02;"Oh, absolutely."
18:02;18:04;"Now go there."
18:04;18:08;"Also guys, Green Day's Dookie sold almost 20 million records."
18:08;18:11;"Okay, oh no, all right, we forgot about Dookie."
18:11;18:13;"That's pop punk."
18:13;18:14;"Yeah."
18:14;18:17;"Okay, there's four rock band albums in the 90s."
18:17;18:21;"Wait, so Chili Peppers, Blood Sugar Sex Magic didn't sell 10 million?"
18:21;18:26;"Probably Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness also, 95."
18:26;18:29;"But I think that counts as like a double album maybe,"
18:29;18:31;"so they might be doubling it."
18:31;18:34;"Back in the day when like they did weird stuff like that."
18:42;18:44;"So far I'm in."
18:44;18:45;"This is sounding good."
18:45;18:48;"How sick would it be if Pearl Jam just dropped a Higher?"
18:48;18:50;"Like no commentary?"
18:50;18:52;"They just dropped--"
18:52;18:54;"Everybody's kind of like, ""Wait, which song is this?"""
18:54;18:56;"Just kind of like nodding their heads."
19:05;19:08;"Pearl Jam just unironically dropping a Creed song?"
19:08;19:10;"That would rule."
19:10;19:11;"At the Forum?"
19:11;19:13;"I mean, there's no way that it would--"
19:13;19:15;"I'm getting goosebumps thinking about it."
19:15;19:17;"But I mean, there's no way that it would be--"
19:17;19:19;"It's impossible for that to be unironic."
19:19;19:23;"I mean, if Eddie really just like delivered it very seriously,"
19:23;19:25;"no smiling."
19:25;19:27;"Could you do a quick number crunch on like,"
19:27;19:29;"has Vedder ever commented on Creed?"
19:40;19:42;"[imitates drumming]"
20:13;20:15;"This is relevant."
20:15;20:18;"So I'm looking up whether or not Eddie Vedder has said anything."
20:18;20:19;"At first glance, no."
20:19;20:22;"However, there's an article from MTV News from 2000."
20:22;20:26;"""Creed bassist disses Pearl Jam in radio interview."""
20:26;20:28;"Here's the quote."
20:28;20:31;"So Brian Marshall, the bassist from Creed,"
20:31;20:36;"was on Seattle radio station KNDD in 2000,"
20:36;20:40;"and he said, ""Eddie Vedder wishes he could write like Scott Stapp."""
20:40;20:41;"Then he backpedaled slightly."
20:41;20:45;"I love Pearl Jam, but I just don't understand the route they took,"
20:45;20:49;"and I don't think it all had to do with Eddie Vedder."
20:49;20:51;"So I guess he sort of caught himself,"
20:51;20:53;"and then he thought, ""Well, let me qualify this a little bit."""
20:53;20:54;"Interesting."
20:54;20:56;"So you said that was from the year 2000?"
20:56;20:57;"Yeah."
20:57;20:59;"Interesting, because, you know, so this is--"
20:59;21:02;"Pearl Jam is entering their wilderness phase."
21:02;21:04;"Records aren't selling like they used to,"
21:04;21:06;"kind of shunning the spotlight."
21:06;21:09;"And then here comes Creed with ""Human Clay,"""
21:09;21:11;"which is their 10."
21:11;21:13;"They're going diamond."
21:13;21:14;"And maybe at that moment--"
21:14;21:17;"This is why you got to be careful with trend forecasting."
21:17;21:20;"At a certain moment, it looks like something's going to go up forever"
21:20;21:21;"and something's going down."
21:21;21:23;"But these things--"
21:23;21:25;"That's not the nature of the universe, man."
21:25;21:27;"You never know where it's heading."
21:27;21:31;"So at that moment, he was probably like, ""Pearl Jam's played out."
21:31;21:32;"I love the early sh--."
21:32;21:33;"They gave up."
21:33;21:34;"The public's turned on them."
21:34;21:36;"We're the f---ing new Pearl Jam."
21:36;21:40;"We're selling more records than them in 20 years."
21:40;21:43;"At minimum, we'll be doing two nights at the Forum."
21:43;21:46;"Pearl Jam, they'll be playing the Troubadour."""
21:46;21:47;"That's how it was looking at that time."
21:47;21:49;"But you got to be careful about trends."
21:49;21:51;"You never know where your ceiling is."
21:51;21:53;"You never know where the floor is."
21:53;21:56;"I always remember I had some professor in college,"
21:56;22:00;"this kind of funny older dude where he talked about"
22:00;22:04;"being in Rochester, New York in the '60s."
22:04;22:05;"Cool."
22:05;22:07;"Rochester's a tight town."
22:07;22:08;"I'm a fan."
22:08;22:09;"But you got to picture this."
22:09;22:16;"In the '60s, I think they had Xerox, IBM, and Eastman Kodak"
22:16;22:18;"were all headquartered in Rochester, New York."
22:18;22:20;"And so for people who don't know, Rochester, New York,"
22:20;22:23;"it's very far from New York City."
22:23;22:25;"It's basically in Canada/Pennsylvania."
22:25;22:26;"Really far away."
22:26;22:28;"Totally different region."
22:28;22:32;"So you can imagine that at the time, people were like,"
22:32;22:34;"""This is like this new power center."""
22:34;22:36;"I mean, of course, I'm sure it already had been a power center"
22:36;22:37;"in some ways."
22:37;22:39;"But anyway, this professor always used to tell the stories."
22:39;22:40;"I remember being at--"
22:40;22:44;"Maybe he went to one of the many colleges in Rochester."
22:44;22:47;"He was like, ""I remember somebody saying at the current growth rates,"""
22:47;22:50;"because Rochester on the business side was so popping in the '60s"
22:50;22:54;"with those companies, that he's like, ""I remember attending a talk"
22:54;22:58;"where somebody said at the current rate, like, Rochester, New York"
22:58;23:04;"is going to be the richest city in the world by the next century."""
23:04;23:08;"He was like, ""The GDP of Rochester is going to equal the GDP"
23:08;23:13;"of like the United Kingdom,"" or whatever, which I'm sure was true"
23:13;23:16;"in the past 10 years at the explosive growth rate."
23:16;23:20;"It's not even that crazy to be like, ""Man, they got IBM."
23:20;23:23;"They were entering the computer age in the '60s."
23:23;23:26;"Maybe Rochester was going to be like the Silicon Valley."""
23:26;23:30;"This is before Apple, before Northern California became the center"
23:30;23:31;"of all that stuff."
23:31;23:34;"Anyway, just an anecdote."
23:34;23:37;"And Rochester is still a cool town, but obviously did not become"
23:37;23:43;"the richest city in the world, nor did its GDP dwarf the United Kingdom,"
23:43;23:45;"let alone anywhere."
23:45;23:47;"You got to be careful with trend forecasting."
23:47;23:51;"In the year 2000, the dude from Creed, he probably felt on top"
23:51;23:54;"of the world, and he felt bad for Eddie."
23:54;23:57;"Maybe he wasn't even--he said, ""I like him,"" but he was just like,"
23:57;23:59;"""Man, this guy lost the plot."""
23:59;24:01;"He said, ""I don't understand the direction they took."""
24:01;24:06;"He seemed mystified by their flagrant anti-commercial stance"
24:06;24:07;"that they took."
24:07;24:11;"Probably the Ticketmaster stuff was very confusing, not to mention"
24:11;24:15;"the palette shift and the songwriting shift from 10 to Versus."
24:15;24:19;"When Eddie started to--the sense I get with 10 is it was basically"
24:19;24:23;"a bunch of classic rock instrumentals that the guys in Pearl Jam"
24:23;24:28;"had written, and then Eddie figured out vocals to sing over them."
24:28;24:31;"Then starting with Versus--and maybe that's a slight exaggeration,"
24:31;24:35;"but I think that was kind of the vibe--and then starting with Versus,"
24:35;24:40;"it was like writing more collaboratively, and it was a much edgier--"
24:40;24:44;"my buddy Alex is going to be calling in in a second--he described Versus"
24:44;24:49;"as Red Hot Chili Peppers meets Fugazi, which is a really funny description"
24:49;24:51;"and accurate."
24:51;24:57;"It's just kind of like--it's upbeat, kind of--I wouldn't say funky,"
24:57;25:04;"but riffy kind of rock, but then with this very confusing punk ethos"
25:04;25:07;"imprinted over it."
25:07;25:10;"Anyway, I can see the guy from Creedus being like, ""What is--what?"
25:10;25:12;"What is this?"""
25:12;25:15;"Right, and then by the time you get to No Code, getting kind of like"
25:15;25:19;"spiritual and kind of world music, he's just like--"
25:19;25:22;"Yeah, that probably just sounds like metal machine music to him"
25:22;25:26;"or something. It just sounds like--it just sounds like--like what?"
25:26;25:30;"This is f***ing insane. Although it is funny because by the time"
25:30;25:34;"they get to their fifth album, Yield, it's like a pretty--just like"
25:34;25:37;"solid, serviceable rock album."
25:37;25:41;"And I guess also he was at the start of his journey with Creed."
25:41;25:44;"I mean, I'm sure Creed had been around for a few years, but he was just"
25:44;25:47;"probably becoming part of this massive band."
25:47;25:52;"Maybe another five years after that, when he'd lived a life in the spotlight"
25:52;25:57;"and all the frustrations and difficulties and drama that come with"
25:57;26:01;"being a public person and being a successful band and stuff,"
26:01;26:05;"I wonder if you caught up with him in 2005 and he would have been like,"
26:05;26:09;"""I don't know what I was talking about, man. I was early in my journey."
26:09;26:12;"Now I understand exactly where Eddie and the boys were coming from."
26:12;26:14;"I'm no longer mystified."""
26:14;26:16;"Yeah, I'm ready for Creed to make our No Code."
26:16;26:19;"Man, a Creed No Code would have been sick."
26:19;26:22;"A Creed No Code probably would have just sounded like the band live."
26:22;26:23;"Yeah, true."

27:33;27:35;"This is a buddy of mine named Alex Gordelis."
27:35;27:39;"He's a writer. He's a multi-hyphenate screenwriter."
27:39;27:40;"He's also a journalist."
27:40;27:43;"He wrote a piece many years ago,"
27:43;27:47;"maybe like 20 years ago on Kyle Field, Little Wings."
27:47;27:50;"And then he recently wrote a piece for Vice."
27:50;27:52;"Got some traction online, I think,"
27:52;27:56;"about the November rain video."
27:56;27:58;"And there's a scene where a guy,"
27:58;28:00;"it's like when it starts raining at the wedding"
28:00;28:02;"with Axel and Stephanie Seymour,"
28:02;28:06;"and a guy just fully dives into the wedding cake."
28:06;28:07;"So he wrote this long piece."
28:07;28:12;"He tracked down who the guy was,"
28:12;28:15;"what the deal with the wedding cake dive was."
28:15;28:18;"He's doing hard-hitting journalism."
28:18;28:20;"- I love it. - Important topics like that."
28:20;28:23;"That's also Donald Trump's favorite music video."
28:23;28:24;"Oh, really?"
28:24;28:26;"Yeah, did we ever talk about this on the show?"
28:26;28:29;"There was this news item a few years ago."
28:29;28:31;"You know how everybody who had anything to do"
28:31;28:33;"with the Trump White House dropped a book?"
28:33;28:35;"You can't even keep track of them anymore,"
28:35;28:39;"but all these people who clearly were drinking the Kool-Aid"
28:39;28:41;"and standing by him and working with him."
28:41;28:44;"And then when things turned, when he's out of office,"
28:44;28:46;"people started to be like, ""I mean, I always f***ing hated him."
28:46;28:48;"Working at the White House was a nightmare."""
28:48;28:50;"And they put out the book immediately."
28:50;28:53;"Just such flagrant cash grabs."
28:53;28:56;"But I remember one of them was somebody who worked in the White House"
28:56;28:58;"or had some connection to him telling stories"
28:58;29:00;"about how weird he was."
29:00;29:03;"And one of them was him just forcing the staff"
29:03;29:06;"to sit down and watch the November rain video."
29:06;29:09;"- What? - It was something like him talking to--"
29:09;29:11;"Who would he have been talking to?"
29:11;29:15;"Like Kellyanne Conway or some spokesperson"
29:15;29:17;"and just being like-- - You gotta see this."
29:17;29:19;"- He made some reference and somebody's like, ""Oh, I haven't seen that."""
29:19;29:21;"He's like, ""You're kidding. You gotta sit down."
29:21;29:23;"This is the weirdest music video of all time."""
29:23;29:25;"- Let's hit pause on this policy meeting"
29:25;29:28;"and then watch a nine-minute music video."
29:28;29:31;"- Yeah. [laughs]"
29:31;29:34;"Like, ""Wait, wait, watch this part. The guy jumps into the cake."
29:34;29:37;"Oh, hell yeah."" - Stephanie Seymour, she's beautiful."
29:37;29:40;"- We should ask Alex if he knows about that."
29:40;29:43;"- Oh, yeah. But I guess he's also a big Pearl Jam fan."
29:43;29:45;"- He's a big PJ head. Yeah, when I found out"
29:45;29:47;"that we were going to the show, I texted him."
29:47;29:49;"I was like, ""You going to this PJ show, dude?"""
29:49;29:51;"So, yeah, he's a big PJ head."
29:51;29:54;"And I feel like he's gonna bring some insight."
29:54;29:57;"- Awesome, yeah, 'cause I'd love to talk to a true head."
29:57;29:59;"- PJ head. - Yeah."
29:59;30:01;"- I mean, I had a great time at the show,"
30:01;30:04;"and I respect them deeply, but I cannot call myself a head."
30:04;30:06;"- Nor I. - Maybe we'll become heads."
30:06;30:08;"- Honestly, as we left that show,"
30:08;30:10;"if schedule had permitted and somebody said,"
30:10;30:12;"""You guys want to come back for night two,"
30:12;30:14;"roll out the red carpet for you,"""
30:14;30:16;"I would have been open to it."
30:16;30:17;"- [laughs]"
30:17;30:19;"- Would that have been a hard no from you, Jake?"
30:19;30:23;"- I think that probably would have been a pass from me."
30:23;30:26;"- No, but let's imagine that you just had nothing to do"
30:26;30:27;"the next day or night."
30:27;30:31;"- If, like, Hannah and the baby were out of town or something,"
30:31;30:32;"and I just, like-- - Yes."
30:32;30:33;"- Yeah, I got nothing."
30:33;30:34;"- [laughs]"
30:34;30:36;"- That's what I'm saying."
30:36;30:38;"You got absolutely nothing going on,"
30:38;30:40;"family's out of town."
30:40;30:42;"- Uh..."
30:42;30:44;"Yeah, sure, yeah, let's do it."
30:44;30:45;"Night two."
30:45;30:47;"- And somebody offered us, like, a party bus,"
30:47;30:49;"so it's gonna be a smooth ride."
30:49;30:52;"We can have a couple drinks on the way down in the party bus."
30:52;30:54;"Not bummer sitting in traffic."
30:54;30:56;"- You're gonna get Jeremy."
30:56;30:58;"You're gonna maybe get Dissident, you know."
30:58;31:00;"- Then, yeah, okay, I'm in."
31:00;31:01;"- Two nights at the Forum."
31:01;31:03;"Could have done it."
31:03;31:05;"All right, but let's get Alex on the phone."
31:05;31:08;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
31:08;31:11;"[phone ringing]"
31:11;31:13;"- Hey."
31:13;31:14;"- Alex."
31:14;31:16;"- Alex, welcome to Time Crisis."
31:16;31:17;"- Thanks, thanks, thanks."
31:17;31:19;"- So, first question, Jake was just talking about"
31:19;31:23;"how you wrote a great piece about the November Rain music video."
31:23;31:26;"That's Donald Trump's favorite music video of all time, right?"
31:26;31:28;"- Yeah, I heard there's a story that he, like,"
31:28;31:31;"made his cabinet members watch the video."
31:31;31:34;"- Yes, okay, that's what I heard."
31:34;31:36;"- Unproven if that's true, but yeah,"
31:36;31:38;"there was, like, a rumor going around."
31:38;31:40;"Some reporter said that, yeah, at a cabinet meeting,"
31:40;31:43;"he, like, took out a laptop and made them watch the video"
31:43;31:46;"and said this is the greatest music video of all time."
31:46;31:49;"- Now, as somebody who's clearly put a lot of,"
31:49;31:51;"maybe more work than anybody on Earth"
31:51;31:53;"into, like, studying this video"
31:53;31:55;"and researching it and unpacking it,"
31:55;31:57;"do you have any, like, gut reaction"
31:57;31:59;"about why he might love that video?"
31:59;32:00;"Is it just 'cause it rules?"
32:00;32:04;"- I also just have some sort of, like, nostalgia."
32:04;32:06;"I feel like '92, I think, is when that video came out."
32:06;32:09;"It was probably, like, his heyday in Manhattan."
32:09;32:11;"He was probably, like, riding high at that time"
32:11;32:14;"in terms of him being on, like, the social scene in Manhattan."
32:14;32:16;"Probably, yeah, just a nostalgia for '92."
32:16;32:18;"- And I guess also, as we're talking about it,"
32:18;32:23;"if you take away any notion of morality or ethics or politics,"
32:23;32:26;"it might just be also as simple as just, like,"
32:26;32:27;"yeah, somebody being--"
32:27;32:30;"Like, because Trump is such a bizarre person,"
32:30;32:32;"when you hear these stories from when he was president,"
32:32;32:34;"they're tinged with weirdness"
32:34;32:38;"and, like, a kind of psychopathic, strange vibe."
32:38;32:40;"Imagine if somebody, like, wrote a book"
32:40;32:42;"and they're just like, ""Memories from the Obama White House."""
32:42;32:44;"It's like, once he stopped a meeting"
32:44;32:46;"to make us all watch the November rain video,"
32:46;32:50;"you'd be kind of like, ""I didn't know Obama liked GNR."""
32:50;32:51;"That's tight."
32:51;32:55;"- Yeah, it's a weird footnote in his presidency."
32:55;32:57;"I don't know if he, like, appreciates"
32:57;32:58;"other Guns N' Roses songs."
32:58;33:00;"I think there's also, like,"
33:00;33:03;"that video is so opulent and over-the-top"
33:03;33:04;"and, like, to his aesthetic."
33:04;33:05;"- Right."
33:05;33:07;"- I think that's probably a larger reason of it as well."
33:07;33:11;"Just, like, the grandiosity of it is very Trumpian."
33:11;33:13;"- Yes, right, that's a good point."
33:13;33:16;"It's super long, it's expensive,"
33:16;33:19;"it's a big, giant wedding, it's big emotions."
33:19;33:23;"Yeah, it's, like, similar to his work as a building developer."
33:23;33:26;"He likes big, dramatic things."

34:09;34:11;"- Before we get to the show,"
34:11;34:14;"tell us about your relationship to Pearl Jam."
34:14;34:16;"- Oh, I'm a head. I'm a huge fan."
34:16;34:19;"By my count, I've seen them 12 times."
34:19;34:21;"I think this was the 12th time seeing them."
34:21;34:22;"- Damn. - Whoa."
34:22;34:24;"- Majority of those were, like, was--"
34:24;34:26;"I was in high school in the '90s,"
34:26;34:27;"and I lived in the Bay Area,"
34:27;34:29;"and they played the Bay Area pretty frequently."
34:29;34:32;"- Now, are there other bands that you've seen that many times?"
34:32;34:34;"- Yeah, this is a good question."
34:34;34:35;"People have mentioned online, like,"
34:35;34:38;"""Is there a band you've seen in the '90s,"
34:38;34:40;"the aughts, the teens, and the '20s?"""
34:40;34:43;"Pearl Jam is the first one I've seen all four."
34:43;34:45;"- Whoa. - The other two would be"
34:45;34:46;"Mudhoney and the Mr. T Experience."
34:46;34:49;"If I see Mudhoney and the Mr. T Experience this decade,"
34:49;34:52;"I will check those lists for all of them."
34:52;34:55;"- Now, can you explain-- I might already have the answer,"
34:55;34:57;"but I'm curious to hear from a true head."
34:57;35:00;"If somebody told me they've seen Mudhoney 12 times or something,"
35:00;35:02;"I'd be like, ""All right, they love Mudhoney."
35:02;35:04;"They check them out every time they come to town."""
35:04;35:07;"Whereas there's something about the way that people talk about"
35:07;35:08;"seeing Pearl Jam many times,"
35:08;35:13;"which weirdly seems closer to people who go see Fish or the Dead."
35:13;35:15;"It seems to transcend a bit of just like,"
35:15;35:18;"""Oh, I like that band. I see them when they come to town."""
35:18;35:22;"It seems like there's a bit more of a communal experience,"
35:22;35:25;"a kind of deeper connection."
35:25;35:27;"Can you speak to that? Is that correct?"
35:27;35:28;"- That's absolutely correct."
35:28;35:31;"I wouldn't say that I'm a part of that community."
35:31;35:32;"From what I've heard,"
35:32;35:35;"the people in that community call themselves the Jamily."
35:35;35:39;"So people who follow Pearl Jam around on the road are the Jamily."
35:39;35:41;"And it's definitely like a Dead-style thing"
35:41;35:44;"where they rove around, follow the band from town to town."
35:44;35:45;"- We did catch--"
35:45;35:48;"I guess these people were probably members of the Jamily"
35:48;35:50;"because when you're watching this show"
35:50;35:52;"and I'm kind of looking for it, I'm like, ""Who is the--?"""
35:52;35:54;"Because of course, it's such a stereotype."
35:54;35:58;"If you go to a jam band show, you see an old head."
35:58;36:02;"It's like, you know, there's a million signifiers, how they look."
36:02;36:03;"You see a young head."
36:03;36:06;"The way their hair is, the way they smell,"
36:06;36:07;"the clothes they're wearing."
36:07;36:09;"There's so many things that broadcast,"
36:09;36:12;"""I dedicate my life to this music, to this community,"
36:12;36:14;"to this lifestyle, and I follow this band around."""
36:14;36:18;"At a Pearl Jam show, you're getting a lot of just like"
36:18;36:23;"very professional-looking Gen Xers, moms and dads, people."
36:23;36:25;"You could catch it, all sorts of different stuff."
36:25;36:26;"But on our way out of the show,"
36:26;36:28;"we were hanging in the lot for a while,"
36:28;36:30;"and I swear-- do you remember this, Jake?"
36:30;36:32;"We passed a Ford Econoline,"
36:32;36:37;"and it was straight up a bunch of gray-haired 55-year-olds"
36:37;36:39;"wearing matching flannel shirts."
36:39;36:40;"It's like as if you had to--"
36:40;36:42;"you know, if you ask somebody,"
36:42;36:45;"""Pick up what somebody who follows Pearl Jam would be."
36:45;36:48;"Take a deadhead, but make them for Pearl Jam."""
36:48;36:49;"And we saw it."
36:49;36:51;"It wasn't overwhelming, but it's this one van"
36:51;36:55;"that was a bunch of people wearing flannels,"
36:55;36:58;"looking like real Pacific Northwest vibes,"
36:58;37:02;"and kind of cracking brews 30, 40 minutes after the show."
37:02;37:05;"I don't know if that's indicative of how most people roll,"
37:05;37:08;"but it was a very strange scene to catch."
37:08;37:10;"- Yeah, it was straight out of a Richard Linklater movie."
37:10;37:13;"- And they were, like, blasting PJ out of--"
37:13;37:16;"like, they had the Econoline back doors open,"
37:16;37:20;"blasting PJ and just slamming, like, Coors Light."
37:20;37:22;"[laughter]"
37:22;37:23;"It was a very cool scene, and yeah,"
37:23;37:26;"and they were probably, like, yeah, guys who were, like, 57"
37:26;37:29;"who have, like, been seeing PJ every year"
37:29;37:31;"for, like, 30-plus years."
37:31;37:33;"- I think Vedder, during the show,"
37:33;37:34;"at some point pointed out, like,"
37:34;37:36;"""Oh, I see a lot of familiar faces in the front"
37:36;37:39;"from the previous show in San Diego."""
37:39;37:41;"I think he gave them a shout-out, so..."
37:41;37:44;"I think those people in the pit do go show to show."
37:44;37:45;"It's a smaller contingent than, like,"
37:45;37:47;"what would follow around ""Fish of the Dead,"""
37:47;37:49;"but they have that community. - Right."
37:49;37:50;"- It goes gig to gig."
37:50;37:52;"- Well, remember, like-- - Okay, but--yeah."
37:52;37:54;"- I was just gonna-- like, on this live tip,"
37:54;37:55;"remember, like, 20 years ago,"
37:55;37:59;"they put out just an obscene amount of live CDs?"
37:59;38:01;"How many shows did they put out, Alex?"
38:01;38:02;"Do you remember?"
38:02;38:03;"- It's a really big number."
38:03;38:04;"I don't know the exact number."
38:04;38:07;"- It was, like, 60-- they, like, dropped, like, 60 live--"
38:07;38:08;"- I think it was, like, every show."
38:08;38:10;"- And I still am mystified by this,"
38:10;38:11;"'cause, like, they--"
38:11;38:14;"like, sometimes Mike McReady will take, like, a long solo,"
38:14;38:15;"but it's, like--"
38:15;38:17;"they're not, like, exploring the material"
38:17;38:20;"in the way that, like, ""The Dead"" and ""The Fish"" do,"
38:20;38:21;"where-- ""The Fish""--"
38:21;38:22;"""The Dead"" and ""Fish"" do,"
38:22;38:24;"where it lends itself to, like,"
38:24;38:26;"""Okay, this version is truly different"
38:26;38:29;"than, like, a version they played a year ago,"""
38:29;38:30;"you know?"
38:30;38:32;"PJ is, like, pretty by the book"
38:32;38:34;"with some, like, extended solos,"
38:34;38:36;"which aren't very good, by the way."
38:36;38:38;"And sort of, like--"
38:38;38:39;"I don't-- I'm so mystified by--"
38:39;38:41;"- Oh, yeah, we haven't talked about this."
38:41;38:42;"Jake loves the show, but--"
38:42;38:46;"but he is not a fan of Mike McReady's guitar work."
38:46;38:48;"- I'm really not a fan, but let's--"
38:48;38:49;"Okay. We can get into it."
38:49;38:50;"- Let's keep it positive."
38:50;38:52;"- [laughs]"
38:52;38:53;"No, I hear you."
38:53;38:55;"- All right, so you're not part of the Jamily."
38:55;38:56;"- Yeah."
38:56;38:57;"- You're Jamily adjacent?"
38:57;38:58;"You're extended Jamily?"
38:58;39:00;"- I'm extended Jamily, for sure."
39:00;39:01;"I'm adjacent."
39:01;39:02;"I fell off--"
39:02;39:03;"previous to this show,"
39:03;39:05;"the last time I saw them was in 2014,"
39:05;39:07;"so it had been a while since I'd seen them."
39:07;39:08;"- Welcome home."
39:08;39:09;"- Thank you."
39:09;39:10;"[laughs]"
39:10;39:12;"- Did you go to both nights?"
39:12;39:14;"- Oh, I only went to the first night."
39:14;39:16;"I sat in the upper deck, back row,"
39:16;39:18;"and the scene around me reminded me of, like,"
39:18;39:19;"a Richard Linklater movie."
39:19;39:21;"Like, Jake was saying, ""Everybody around me."""
39:21;39:22;"It was weird."
39:22;39:24;"It was, like, people in their 20s"
39:24;39:25;"who were wearing flannels"
39:25;39:27;"and had long hair and were headbanging."
39:27;39:28;"It surprised me that there was, like,"
39:28;39:30;"a younger crowd sitting around me."
39:30;39:31;"- Ah, I'm interested in that,"
39:31;39:33;"because where we were--"
39:33;39:36;"our friend hooked us up with, like, great seats."
39:36;39:39;"I was eating some fettuccine in the Forum Club"
39:39;39:41;"just before we had--"
39:41;39:43;"- Winning time style."
39:43;39:45;"- I've only been to a few shows at the Forum,"
39:45;39:47;"but in the Forum Club,"
39:47;39:49;"which is where the Lakers used to party"
39:49;39:50;"back in the day,"
39:50;39:51;"and now is just kind of, like,"
39:51;39:52;"a slightly corporate, like,"
39:52;39:54;"VIP area to get a drink and food."
39:54;39:55;"Every time I go,"
39:55;39:59;"there's, like, a different theme for the food,"
39:59;40:01;"and I can't make heads or tails of it,"
40:01;40:02;"but--well, actually,"
40:02;40:04;"I saw Drake there,"
40:04;40:06;"and it was all, like, Southern barbecue,"
40:06;40:09;"and I was like, ""Well, Migos was opening."
40:09;40:10;"They're from Atlanta."""
40:10;40:12;"I was like, ""All right, that kind of makes sense."""
40:12;40:16;"But for Pearl Jam Night, all Italian food."
40:16;40:18;"[laughter]"
40:18;40:19;"- Well, I was sitting in the--"
40:19;40:21;"at the bar near the upper deck."
40:21;40:24;"They were selling a drink called the Evenflow."
40:24;40:26;"It was $16.50 for a Jack and Coke,"
40:26;40:28;"but they called the Jack and Coke an Evenflow."
40:28;40:31;"- Oh, they didn't even, like, mix it up somehow"
40:31;40:32;"to make it--"
40:32;40:33;"- No."
40:33;40:36;"- Picture telling Eddie that 25 years ago."
40:36;40:39;"[laughter]"
40:39;40:42;"One day, they'll be selling a $16.50"
40:42;40:44;"Jack and Coke called the Evenflow."
40:44;40:46;"Now he can probably laugh about it."

42:07;42:11;"a lot of, like, older couples, like, mom and dad's night out."
42:11;42:14;"I don't think I saw a single person under 30,"
42:14;42:16;"but you're saying you felt there was a youth contingent"
42:16;42:17;"in the building."
42:17;42:19;"- But it had a presence around me, yeah,"
42:19;42:21;"and so it was like, it made me think of, like, oh, yeah,"
42:21;42:24;"that would be, like, my age, I'm 41."
42:24;42:26;"Like, I had friends in high school who were, like,"
42:26;42:28;"really into the page and plant reunion."
42:28;42:31;"- Sure, yeah."
42:31;42:32;"- It's the same vibe."
42:32;42:35;"It's like, oh, yeah, like, these guys are from a while back."
42:35;42:37;"They're from before I was born, but they're my thing."
42:37;42:38;"I'm gonna go check them out."
42:38;42:40;"And they were living the grunge lifestyle."
42:40;42:41;"These guys, yeah, they all had long hair."
42:41;42:42;"They all had flannels on."
42:42;42:44;"They were headbanging the whole show."
42:44;42:46;"It was funny, I mean, blah."
42:46;42:48;"- So what did you think of the show?"
42:48;42:50;"First show in eight years."
42:50;42:51;"- Been a while."
42:51;42:53;"I mean, I loved the show."
42:53;42:54;"I loved the energy."
42:54;42:56;"I thought the band played great."
42:56;42:59;"As I exited, I had a couple thoughts,"
42:59;43:02;"critical thoughts that I sort of went in and checked"
43:02;43:04;"the fan forums to see what the fans,"
43:04;43:05;"if they agreed with me."
43:05;43:07;"And people were agreeing on these two things."
43:07;43:11;"One was that a typical Pearl Jam set list"
43:11;43:13;"pre-pandemic is 30 songs."
43:13;43:16;"And they do a 50/50 split."
43:16;43:21;"So it's like 15 classics, 15 deep cuts and new songs."
43:21;43:23;"- Ah, that's the formula?"
43:23;43:25;"- That's the formula, but the current set list,"
43:25;43:27;"they're doing 22 songs."
43:27;43:31;"Still 50/50, so you're getting 11 deep cuts"
43:31;43:33;"and new songs, 11 classics."
43:33;43:36;"As I left, as good as the show was,"
43:36;43:39;"I did feel deprived of four classics."
43:39;43:42;"I felt like there was no Better Man,"
43:42;43:44;"no Daughter, no Rearview Mirror."
43:44;43:47;"A lot of live staples weren't in the set list."
43:47;43:49;"- Well, that's why you gotta go to night two."
43:49;43:50;"- Night two, you heard all of them."
43:50;43:51;"They switched it out."
43:51;43:54;"Night two, you heard the four songs that we didn't hear."
43:54;43:55;"- That's Eddie's way of signaling,"
43:55;43:57;"""Listen, when we do a two-night stand,"
43:57;43:59;"""you get your ass to both nights."""
43:59;44:00;"(laughing)"
44:00;44:04;"""I'm not giving you 30 songs night one and night two."
44:04;44:06;"""I gotta pace myself."""
44:06;44:09;"- This is a big topic on the fan forums."
44:09;44:11;"So the fans are saying the 22-song set list"
44:11;44:13;"is the new normal."
44:13;44:16;"And they're hypothesizing that these guys are pushing 60."
44:16;44:19;"I think Better's 57, Heyman's 59."
44:19;44:22;"They're saying the days of the 30-song set list are over."
44:22;44:23;"- That's tough."
44:23;44:24;"(laughing)"
44:24;44:25;"That's tough."
44:25;44:26;"- A lot of theories floating around."
44:26;44:28;"They're like, ""Maybe the forum had a curfew."""
44:28;44:30;"But I think all the shows have been that way."
44:30;44:33;"So you're getting a show that's two hours and change"
44:33;44:35;"and not a three-hour show."
44:35;44:36;"- Yeah, how long was this show?"
44:36;44:37;"- I'm happy with that."
44:37;44:38;"(laughing)"
44:38;44:40;"- This show felt kind of like a perfect length,"
44:40;44:41;"although I could see--"
44:41;44:42;"- It flew by."
44:42;44:43;"- It actually flew by."
44:43;44:45;"Yeah, if they had added a few songs,"
44:45;44:46;"I wouldn't have been mad."
44:46;44:49;"But I'm also speaking as a very casual fan."
44:49;44:53;"Yeah, if I was super hardcore, maybe I'd want a bit more."
44:53;44:55;"I know that with Pearl Jam fans,"
44:55;44:57;"the length of the show is a big thing."
44:57;45:00;"I've definitely looked up longest Pearl Jam shows ever."
45:00;45:02;"And it's like, I think their longest is what,"
45:02;45:04;"like three and a half?"
45:04;45:05;"- Yeah, I think probably like three and a half."
45:05;45:07;"- Was this pushing like two and a half?"
45:07;45:09;"- I think this was like 2.15,"
45:09;45:11;"maybe two hours, 10 minutes, maybe."
45:11;45:12;"Around there."
45:12;45:13;"- That's pretty solid."
45:13;45:15;"And I got another question for you."
45:15;45:20;"When you talk about the classics versus new and deep cuts,"
45:20;45:22;"do Pearl Jam classics have to be"
45:22;45:25;"from the era of the first three albums?"
45:25;45:26;"Like how do you define classics?"
45:26;45:28;"Does that mean singles?"
45:28;45:30;"- Singles from the '90s, I would say,"
45:30;45:32;"is how I define the classics."
45:32;45:34;"- Okay, so all the way to Yield?"
45:34;45:35;"- All the way to--"
45:35;45:37;"Yield and No Code are my two favorites."
45:37;45:39;"I've had this conversation with Jake before, I think."
45:39;45:42;"Yield and No Code are my personal favorites."
45:42;45:44;"Going up, probably Yield, I think."
45:44;45:45;"- Amazing."
45:45;45:46;"(laughing)"
45:46;45:47;"That's incredible."
45:47;45:49;"(laughing)"
45:49;45:50;"I've never heard Yield."
45:50;45:53;"- I think No Code is really cool and underrated."
45:53;45:55;"- And the two things those albums have in common"
45:55;45:57;"is those are the only two albums"
45:57;45:59;"with Jack Irons on drums,"
45:59;46:01;"who was the Chili Peppers original drummer."
46:01;46:02;"- Okay, here we go."
46:02;46:03;"- Right."
46:03;46:04;"- The drummer talk was the other thing"
46:04;46:06;"that's all over the fan forums."
46:06;46:08;"So Pearl Jam has had five drummers."
46:08;46:11;"Matt Cameron has been their drummer since '98."
46:11;46:13;"Just like a monster drummer, incredible drummer,"
46:13;46:16;"but there's a large contingent of the fans"
46:16;46:19;"that are critical of his tempos."
46:19;46:21;"- Classic longstanding band issue."
46:21;46:23;"I mean, like, the fans are hating"
46:23;46:25;"the Dead & Co. tempos, for instance."
46:25;46:27;"- I was reading the fan forums,"
46:27;46:30;"people criticizing his tempo on Evenflo."
46:30;46:32;"- Too fast or too slow?"
46:32;46:33;"- Well, here's the thing."
46:33;46:35;"I looked at the video from the show we went to."
46:35;46:38;"The first comment on Evenflo video on YouTube"
46:38;46:40;"from the show we went to was, ""What's the rush, bro?"""
46:40;46:43;"So there's a fan definitely being critical."
46:43;46:46;"His BPM, I timed it on my phone."
46:46;46:47;"I got the--"
46:47;46:48;"- ♪ Evenflo ♪"
46:48;46:49;"(laughing)"
46:49;46:51;"(scatting)"
46:51;46:53;"- I got the metronome out on my iPhone,"
46:53;46:54;"and I timed it."
46:54;46:56;"So on the album version,"
46:56;46:57;"the beats per minute is 105."
46:57;47:00;"Live, he's pushing 120, 125."
47:00;47:01;"- Oh, wow. - Whoa."
47:01;47:02;"- It's a big jump."
47:02;47:03;"- Bro."
47:03;47:04;"(laughing)"
47:04;47:05;"- I feel like we've talked, too,"
47:05;47:09;"about maybe him being slightly too technical."
47:09;47:12;"We were talking about PJ drumming,"
47:12;47:13;"and you were sort of saying,"
47:13;47:15;"or maybe we were kind of agreeing,"
47:15;47:17;"that if they had a less flashy,"
47:17;47:20;"kind of more like No Frills bar band drummer,"
47:20;47:21;"like Dave Krusev,"
47:21;47:23;"and he played on the original record,"
47:23;47:24;"that might be a better fit."
47:24;47:25;"- Yes."
47:25;47:26;"- I feel like you were saying,"
47:26;47:28;"I don't want to make you publicly"
47:28;47:30;"put Matt Cameron on blast."
47:30;47:32;"(laughing)"
47:32;47:34;"- You were saying to me"
47:34;47:36;"that you thought he was too good,"
47:36;47:37;"like too technical."
47:37;47:38;"- Too technical, I mean,"
47:38;47:41;"he's one of my favorite drummers ever."
47:41;47:42;"- I mean, Soundgarden."
47:42;47:44;"- Soundgarden, incredible."
47:44;47:45;"Oh, yeah, Dave Krusev,"
47:45;47:46;"he's the drummer who played on 10."
47:46;47:49;"There's definitely more of a swing to his playing"
47:49;47:50;"than what Cameron does."
47:50;47:55;"And then also, Dave Abruzzese was the second drummer,"
47:55;47:56;"or the third drummer."
47:56;47:57;"There've been five."
47:57;48:01;"Abruzzese drummed on Versus and Vitology."
48:01;48:02;"- Vitology, yeah."
48:02;48:04;"- And also, surprisingly,"
48:04;48:05;"he didn't get nominated"
48:05;48:07;"into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with them,"
48:07;48:09;"even though he plays on two of their biggest albums."
48:09;48:10;"They have some differences."
48:10;48:13;"But yeah, those two drummers are slower,"
48:13;48:16;"more feel-based drummers than, yeah,"
48:16;48:18;"Matt Cameron's a lot of fireworks,"
48:18;48:19;"a lot of technical stuff."
48:19;48:21;"Big disagreements in the fan community."
48:21;48:22;"- What's the rush, bro?"
48:22;48:24;"- What's the rush, bro, is that comment."
48:24;48:25;"- Next time I meet anybody"
48:25;48:27;"who identifies as a Pearl Jam fan,"
48:27;48:28;"I'm gonna be like,"
48:28;48:30;"""All right, rank the five drummers in order."""
48:30;48:34;"- Oh, I, that's, I mean, I have a ranking."
48:34;48:35;"- Please. - You do?"
48:35;48:37;"All right, bro, take it down."
48:37;48:39;"- Jack Irons plays on my two favorites."
48:39;48:40;"He's number one."
48:40;48:43;"I love Matt Cameron, gonna put him two."
48:43;48:46;"Dave Kruisen only played on 10, great album."
48:46;48:47;"Matt Chamberlain is a drummer"
48:47;48:49;"who only played in the band for a month."
48:49;48:51;"And he's an interesting story."
48:51;48:52;"I feel like he's a minor figure"
48:52;48:54;"in the Pearl Jam story."
48:54;48:55;"- What era?"
48:55;48:56;"- 10 era."
48:56;48:58;"So Dave Kruisen, who played on 10,"
48:58;49:02;"had to go to rehab for alcoholism."
49:02;49:03;"So I had to leave the band"
49:03;49:05;"and the band had to keep trucking on without him."
49:05;49:08;"So they hire this guy, Matt Chamberlain,"
49:08;49:10;"who was previously the drummer"
49:10;49:12;"and E.D. Burkell and the New Bohemians."
49:12;49:13;"- Okay."
49:13;49:16;"- He drums with them for a month in '91,"
49:16;49:18;"like summer of '91, drums them for one month."
49:18;49:21;"And then at that time, 10 was out,"
49:21;49:24;"but 10 took one year to take off."
49:24;49:26;"10 didn't hit the Billboard Top 10"
49:26;49:28;"'til it had been out for almost a year."
49:28;49:29;"- Wow."
49:29;49:30;"- Which is unheard of now."
49:30;49:33;"But so Matt Chamberlain is in the band for one month."
49:33;49:35;"The band hasn't taken off yet."
49:35;49:36;"Matt Chamberlain gets a call,"
49:36;49:38;"gets a job offer to be the drummer"
49:38;49:40;"in the house band for SNL."
49:40;49:42;"Leaves Pearl Jam to take that job."
49:42;49:43;"(laughing)"
49:43;49:45;"And so like, at the time,"
49:45;49:47;"that probably seems like a good decision."
49:47;49:49;"It's like, oh, you're like filling in"
49:49;49:50;"on this like Seattle band"
49:50;49:52;"that has an album out that's not selling."
49:52;49:54;"You get the call from G.E. Smith"
49:54;49:56;"or Lorne Michaels or whoever."
49:56;49:57;"And they say, ""Come join."""
49:57;49:59;"You get to be on TV every week."
49:59;50:00;"Steady gig."
50:00;50:03;"- Early '90s SNL, pretty strong cast."
50:03;50:06;"- Yeah, so he left the band after a month"
50:06;50:07;"to take that SNL gig."
50:07;50:08;"- Wow."
50:08;50:09;"Has he ever done an interview?"
50:09;50:10;"Does he regret it?"
50:10;50:11;"- I don't think he regrets it."
50:11;50:12;"He is like a very--"
50:12;50:13;"- I hope not, yeah."
50:13;50:14;"I hope he doesn't regret it."
50:14;50:16;"- He was on SNL for a few years, I think."
50:16;50:18;"And then went on to become like"
50:18;50:20;"one of the top studio drummers."
50:20;50:22;"He drummed on the most recent Bob Dylan album."
50:22;50:24;"- Oh yeah, he's a great drummer."
50:24;50:27;"I actually, I met him once at a studio"
50:27;50:29;"and I asked him about when Edie Burkell"
50:29;50:32;"and the New Bohemians opened for the dead."
50:32;50:33;"- What did he have to say about that?"
50:33;50:34;"(laughing)"
50:34;50:36;"So you knew his pedigree meeting him."
50:36;50:39;"You knew like, oh, this guy was in the New Bohemians."
50:39;50:41;"- Yeah, I think I knew that part."
50:41;50:43;"I'd never heard this SNL thing before,"
50:43;50:46;"but I knew that he kind of like came up with Edie Burkell."
50:46;50:48;"I remember he said like, Jerry was funny."
50:48;50:51;"No, no great stories, but he was just kind of like,"
50:51;50:53;"I just had to ask."

51:57;52:02;"- All this is to say that you're disrespecting Dave Abruzzese?"
52:02;52:04;"- Oh, wait, no, no, no. - To the extent that you're"
52:04;52:07;"putting him dead last? - No, no, no, I left it out."
52:07;52:10;"Abruzzese probably comes, has to come above Matt Chambers."
52:10;52:13;"Abruzzese plays on their iconic albums,"
52:13;52:16;"which is why I think it's weird that they didn't induct him."
52:16;52:18;"I don't know if the Hall of Fame is like whatever, but yeah, they didn't induct him."
52:18;52:21;"He plays on arguably, yeah, two of their biggest albums."
52:21;52:23;"- And he was a good drummer. Not arguably."
52:23;52:25;"- Without a doubt, yeah, without a doubt, yeah, yeah."
52:25;52:29;"- And anyway, I guess you, we forced you to rank them, so..."
52:29;52:32;"- Wait, so you're putting Matt Cameron above Abruzzese?"
52:32;52:35;"- Ah, see, now we're getting into it. I think, no."
52:35;52:38;"You're right, I should probably swap him. Abruzzese, those are iconic songs,"
52:38;52:41;"and he played on them, you gotta give him credit."
52:41;52:44;"- Do you like his playing on those songs? Do you like that snare tone?"
52:44;52:47;"- That's a weird snare tone, right?"
52:47;52:50;"- Yeah, on verses? - Yeah, it's a little thin and reedy."
52:50;52:55;"- The early '90s were an insane time for snare tones across the board."
52:55;52:58;"A real low point for rock snare tones."
52:58;53:02;"- Yeah, it's not a great drum sound. I do like his playing, though."
53:02;53:07;"And he's just funny because I think the reason why they fired him from the band"
53:07;53:11;"was he just loved being a rock star, and that was not their scene."
53:11;53:15;"He didn't understand why they weren't making a ton of music videos,"
53:15;53:18;"he didn't understand why they weren't doing interviews,"
53:18;53:21;"he wanted to be on magazine covers."
53:21;53:27;"- Yes, I've heard this story that Eddie, he wanted a moratorium on Pearl Jam Press,"
53:27;53:33;"and Dave Abruzzese accepted an offer to be on the cover of Modern Drummer magazine."
53:33;53:36;"Eddie f***ing blew a gasket."
53:36;53:39;"You Hollywood piece of s***."
53:39;53:42;"- Of all the magazines. - You egotistical bastard."
53:42;53:45;"You just had to be on the cover of Modern Drummer."
53:45;53:48;"- Yeah, on the cover of Modern Drummer."
53:48;53:51;"Obviously this is all rumor, but reading magazine articles"
53:51;53:54;"that Eddie didn't like that he wore track suits also,"
53:54;53:57;"I think he wore Adidas track suits."
53:57;54:01;"I think that was not in step with the Pearl Jam image."
54:01;54:04;"And unfortunately, he got a big Pearl Jam tattoo."
54:04;54:07;"- I think he's a little bit biased."
54:07;54:10;"- Yeah, I think so."
54:10;54:13;"- And Abruzzese also was born in Stamford, Connecticut,"
54:13;54:15;"so Jake's got a ride for him."
54:15;54:18;"He's a Connecticut rocker. Tri-state area rocker."
54:18;54:21;"- Okay, gotta add him to the pantheon."
54:21;54:23;"- What was your thoughts on the show?"
54:23;54:27;"How did you guys feel about the set? How Pearl Jam played?"
54:27;54:32;"Because you're casual fans, did it bug you that almost half the set was songs off of gigaton?"
54:32;54:36;"- I did my research, you know, like it's a kind of a when in Rome situation."
54:36;54:41;"If you know you're traveling to another country, you should familiarize yourself with the cuisine."
54:41;54:46;"If you know you're going to see Pearl Jam in 2022, you gotta throw on gigaton that day."
54:46;54:47;"- For sure."
54:47;54:52;"- And we both did. So, I actually, you know, I felt like by showtime,"
54:52;54:56;"I was familiar with at least three or four of the songs they played off the new album."
54:56;54:58;"And I enjoyed them."
54:58;55:00;"And then I was pleasantly surprised. I was saying to Jake,"
55:00;55:03;"there was this one kind of like African groove in 6/8,"
55:03;55:06;"that song that they dropped called ""Buckle Up""."
55:06;55:09;"I was like, this is either from the new album or from No Code."
55:09;55:11;"I looked it up later, it was from the new album."
55:11;55:15;"And I was like, it was like provided a totally different feel, a different moment in the set."
55:15;55:16;"It was a good song."
55:16;55:25;"I got blood, blood on my hands"
55:25;55:34;"The stain of, of a human"
55:34;55:44;"I finally awoke to my mother's wrath"
55:44;55:55;"Cold lies, bed sores and sponge baths"
55:55;56:00;"Firstly do no harm"
56:00;56:08;"Then put your seatbelt on"
56:08;56:17;"Buckle up"
56:17;56:23;"Buckle up"
56:23;56:26;"- And also, as we were discussing, you know,"
56:26;56:29;"they're really good at kind of like spacing things out."
56:29;56:31;"- For sure. Yeah. There's a good flow to the set."
56:31;56:35;"Like when the classics do hit, it's a big moment."
56:35;56:37;"And like, yeah, it keeps you engaged the whole time."
56:37;56:40;"- Also, I mean, they would take these little mini set breaks"
56:40;56:44;"where all the lights would come down except for a light on Eddie."
56:44;56:48;"And he would do like a good three, four minutes of banter."
56:48;56:51;"- His banter, yeah, his banter was surprisingly good."
56:51;56:54;"- Is that a classic Pearl Jam thing that Eddie talks a lot?"
56:54;56:55;"- That is a classic thing."
56:55;56:58;"Definitely like going into like after an encore break,"
56:58;57:01;"he'll do like a two or three minute speech usually."
57:01;57:03;"And yeah, sometime in the middle of the regular set,"
57:03;57:05;"he'll go off and do a speech."
57:05;57:08;"- He did a couple. I mean, there was the Howard Zinn shout out."
57:08;57:10;"- Which I didn't follow. I was trying to like,"
57:10;57:12;"I heard him mention Howard Zinn."
57:12;57:14;"- That was the least coherent."
57:14;57:16;"You could tell he was freestyling."
57:16;57:19;"Also, he's drinking a bottle of red wine throughout the show,"
57:19;57:21;"which we were both very surprised by."
57:21;57:23;"Just not that he would be drinking on stage,"
57:23;57:26;"but just like red wine and his voice sounded great."
57:26;57:27;"- Yeah."
57:27;57:29;"- And he didn't have any water on stage."
57:29;57:34;"And he drank from the red wine bottle probably like a half dozen times,"
57:34;57:38;"which is like the driest possible drink."
57:38;57:40;"- Yes. And he did make a comment though,"
57:40;57:42;"that like the red wine straight from the bottle"
57:42;57:44;"is something he usually does during shows."
57:44;57:46;"And he made a comment that he'll also drink from it"
57:46;57:48;"and pass it around the audience."
57:48;57:51;"- But he said he doesn't do that anymore due to COVID, right?"
57:51;57:53;"- Yeah. Can't do that anymore due to COVID."
57:53;57:54;"He's like, I'd give it to you, but I can't."
57:54;57:56;"So he keeps the red wine to himself."
57:56;57:58;"- So the guy loves red wine."
57:58;57:59;"So that's a classic move."
57:59;58:01;"Full bottle of red wine."
58:01;58:02;"That's unique."
58:02;58:04;"- Put down a full bottle of red wine."
58:04;58:08;"Some of his like moments were just like telling these great,"
58:08;58:10;"engaging, funny stories."
58:10;58:12;"Like he was being at the forum."
58:12;58:14;"He talks about the history of the forum."
58:14;58:18;"Then he tells a funny, sad story about him being 14"
58:18;58:20;"and coming to see Pink Floyd, the wall tour,"
58:20;58:23;"smoking weed with his buddy in the car."
58:23;58:25;"And he started to get anxious."
58:25;58:26;"I don't want to miss the show, man."
58:26;58:28;"The guy's like, hold on, hold on, let's finish the joint."
58:28;58:31;"And then the guy finally realizes he doesn't have the tickets"
58:31;58:32;"to the show."
58:32;58:33;"Eddie's crestfallen."
58:33;58:35;"And then the guy's like, well, okay, hold on."
58:35;58:36;"Maybe we could buy a ticket."
58:36;58:39;"And the guy had just had enough money to buy himself a ticket."
58:39;58:42;"So young Eddie Vedder had to sit in the parking lot"
58:42;58:45;"of the forum for like three hours while his buddy went"
58:45;58:48;"and watched the show he had hoped to see and came out."
58:48;58:49;"And then he had like really good timing"
58:49;58:51;"and everybody was like, aw."
58:51;58:54;"And then Eddie goes, but look at me now."
58:54;58:55;"(laughing)"
58:55;58:56;"I was like, all right."
58:56;58:58;"- It was a well-crafted story, yeah."
58:58;59:01;"- Yeah, yeah, he's got top shelf banter."
59:01;59:04;"But the one moment where we thought it was a little bit"
59:04;59:07;"incoherent, although still charming and funny,"
59:07;59:09;"he just went on this thing about like,"
59:09;59:13;"you know, Bill Burr played here last night at the forum"
59:13;59:17;"and people were like, kind of like, woo, all right."
59:17;59:19;"He's like, he's from Boston."
59:19;59:22;"And you know, because like the forum still represents"
59:22;59:24;"the Lakers to people and they famously had the rivalry"
59:24;59:25;"with the Celtics, there's a little bit of like rumbling,"
59:25;59:27;"like Boston."
59:27;59:30;"And he's like, you know, I love Boston."
59:30;59:31;"People are like, what?"
59:31;59:34;"And he's like, you know, my favorite person from Boston"
59:34;59:36;"is Howard Zinn."
59:36;59:38;"- It was a weird left turn."
59:38;59:40;"- The Bill Burr to Howard Zinn thing."
59:40;59:43;"But no, all in all, A plus banter."
59:43;59:45;"And that really gave the show a kind of like,"
59:45;59:47;"even though you're in this big arena,"
59:47;59:51;"and Pearl Jam, they do, do they always do 360 seating?"
59:51;59:53;"- And all the times I've seen them, surprisingly,"
59:53;59:55;"this is the first time I've ever seen them indoors."
59:55;59:57;"- Oh, oh, interesting."
59:57;59:59;"You've seen them at amphitheaters and--"
59:59;01:00:00;"- Amphitheaters."
01:00:00;01:00:03;"The first time I ever saw them was in '95."
01:00:03;01:00:05;"They played the Polo Field in San Francisco."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"Infamous show."
01:00:06;01:00:07;"- Sick."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"- Eddie started vomiting during--"
01:00:09;01:00:10;"- Oh, and then Neil Young came out?"
01:00:10;01:00:13;"- Yeah, it was a show, there was like 60,000 people there,"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"their biggest show to date."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"And like six songs into the set,"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"he just started vomiting on stage."
01:00:19;01:00:20;"- What?"
01:00:20;01:00:21;"- And had to bail."
01:00:21;01:00:22;"- Stomach flu?"
01:00:22;01:00:25;"- He said he ate like a bad tuna sandwich at the hotel,"
01:00:25;01:00:26;"something like that."
01:00:26;01:00:29;"- He's like, ""This bottle of red wine is skunked."
01:00:29;01:00:31;"""Oh no."""
01:00:31;01:00:33;"- So he had to leave,"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"and then Neil Young was hanging out backstage,"
01:00:35;01:00:36;"and at the time,"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"Neil Young had just made the album Mirrorball"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"with Pearl Jam."
01:00:40;01:00:43;"And so Neil came out and played like an hour and a half set instead."
01:00:43;01:00:45;"And Pearl Jam was embarrassed"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"because the fans were not cool with Neil coming out."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"I think there was some booing going on"
01:00:50;01:00:54;"when it was announced that Eddie Vedder wouldn't be returning."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"- Who the hell is Neil Young?"
01:00:56;01:00:59;"- Yeah, that was the vibe."
01:01:01;01:01:04;"There's a place called downtown"
01:01:04;01:01:08;"Where the hippies all go"
01:01:08;01:01:12;"And they dance the Charleston"
01:01:12;01:01:16;"And they do the limbo"
01:01:16;01:01:20;"Yeah, the hippies all go there"
01:01:20;01:01:24;"'Cause they wanna be seen"
01:01:24;01:01:28;"It's like a room full of pictures"
01:01:28;01:01:31;"It's like a psychedelic dream"
01:01:31;01:01:35;"Downtown, let's go downtown"
01:01:35;01:01:39;"Downtown at night"
01:01:39;01:01:43;"Downtown, let's have a party"
01:01:43;01:01:47;"Downtown at night"
01:01:47;01:01:49;"- What's the origin of the name Pearl Jam?"
01:01:49;01:01:51;"Like, what is that?"
01:01:51;01:01:55;"Is that something that's found around a pearl?"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"Like, what is the etymology?"
01:01:57;01:02:01;"- I mean, does anybody wanna field this?"
01:02:01;01:02:04;"- Well, I mean, the popular myth is that it's a..."
01:02:04;01:02:05;"[bleep]"
01:02:05;01:02:06;"- Yeah."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"- I mean, they're probably gonna bleep this out on the show, but..."
01:02:08;01:02:11;"- Oh my God, I've never heard that in that context before."
01:02:11;01:02:12;"Oh no."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"[laughter]"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"I didn't realize that was the thing, for real."
01:02:15;01:02:16;"- Wait, did you really not know?"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"- I truly did not know."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"I've never known that in my life."
01:02:20;01:02:21;"I wasn't trying to..."
01:02:21;01:02:22;"- On the one hand..."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"- ...publicate you to talk about..."
01:02:23;01:02:27;"- Was it known for a fact that the band..."
01:02:27;01:02:30;"in the band's mind in 1991, that that's what it was referencing?"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"- I've read interviews, like at the time,"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"obviously when you're a new band, you get the question,"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"""Where'd you come up with your band name?"""
01:02:36;01:02:37;"They would get that in early interviews,"
01:02:37;01:02:40;"and they would have a made-up story of like,"
01:02:40;01:02:43;"""Oh, one of us has a grandmother named Pearl,"
01:02:43;01:02:44;"and she used to make jam."""
01:02:44;01:02:46;"They would just tell a nonsense story."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"- That's what I'm seeing."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"Vedder said the name Pearl Jam was a reference"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"to his great-grandmother, Pearl."
01:02:51;01:02:54;"- Also, there's like classic rock connotations"
01:02:54;01:02:57;"to both words, ""jam"" and ""Pearl"" is Janis Joplin."
01:02:57;01:02:59;"There's like, I don't know."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"- It's... - It's also Pearl Drums."
01:03:01;01:03:02;"- Yes, exactly."
01:03:02;01:03:03;"- Famous brand of drums."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"It's a cool name."
01:03:05;01:03:08;"I mean, I don't love the male ejaculate association."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"[laughter]"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"Although, when you think about Pearl Jam"
01:03:11;01:03:14;"being kind of a very late period classic rock band,"
01:03:14;01:03:16;"it's a pretty appropriate name."
01:03:16;01:03:19;"- Right, it's just a bunch of dudes on stage."
01:03:19;01:03:21;"- They're just, yeah, I mean, that's the ethos"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"of a lot of classic rock, maybe."
01:03:23;01:03:25;"- Is this a well-known expression, though?"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"Like, when you were kids?"
01:03:27;01:03:28;"- No, no, no, no."
01:03:28;01:03:30;"- So you learned about this."
01:03:30;01:03:32;"- The first time I ever heard the term Pearl Jam"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"was in relation to the band."
01:03:34;01:03:36;"- And did it immediately click for you?"
01:03:36;01:03:37;"- No. - No."
01:03:37;01:03:38;"- When I was 14? - No, okay."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"- No, it was many, many years later"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"that I heard, more of an urban legend, really,"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"in my book, that I would hear someone be like,"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"""Oh, you know what that's in reference to?"""
01:03:45;01:03:47;"And I'd be like, ""Oh, that actually does make sense."""
01:03:47;01:03:49;"I had that moment that you just had, Seinfeld,"
01:03:49;01:03:51;"like 15 years ago or whatever."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"- Same, same, I probably, like, grew up through that,"
01:03:53;01:03:54;"I was gonna dawn on me."
01:03:54;01:03:55;"I was like, ""Oh, is that what that means?"""
01:03:55;01:03:56;"- Wow. - Did you guys buy"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"any merch at the show?"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"- Well, our friend Brian did."
01:04:00;01:04:03;"He bought our whole crew some bootleg merch."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"So Jake and I now have matching"
01:04:05;01:04:09;"three-quarter length Pearl Jam bootleg baseball shirts."
01:04:09;01:04:12;"If we ever started, like, a softball team."
01:04:12;01:04:14;"- Yeah, talk about Richard Linklater."
01:04:14;01:04:17;"Man, the three-quarter length T-shirts."
01:04:17;01:04:19;"- Yeah. - Yeah, after the show,"
01:04:19;01:04:22;"we did, like, parking lot hot dogs."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"- Ooh, that was so good."
01:04:23;01:04:24;"- And Brian scored those shirts."
01:04:24;01:04:28;"We did, like, a solid, like, 25-minute parking lot"
01:04:28;01:04:31;"kind of hang afterwards, which felt great."
01:04:31;01:04:33;"- It's a real classic rock experience."
01:04:33;01:04:35;"- Yeah. - Yeah, I definitely felt like"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"I was starting to understand the jamily"
01:04:37;01:04:40;"and the Pearl Jam ethos, and I'll definitely catch"
01:04:40;01:04:42;"another Pearl Jam show in the future."
01:04:42;01:04:45;"And as Jake was saying, there's a lot of songs we missed."
01:04:45;01:04:48;"- Got ahead of multiple shows on the tour to hear 'em all."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"- It's time to getcha."
01:04:49;01:04:52;"And I could see how even if each song"
01:04:52;01:04:55;"is not particularly different, you get a different set list,"
01:04:55;01:04:58;"you get some different banter, different vibe at the show."
01:04:58;01:05:00;"In some ways, that's enough to, like,"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"want to catch a few shows on a tour."
01:05:02;01:05:05;"- Yeah. - We heard another one"
01:05:05;01:05:08;"of our producers, Colin, who's a big Pearl Jam head,"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"said that on some of the fan forums,"
01:05:10;01:05:14;"there was discussion that the audience was subdued"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"or low energy at this show."
01:05:16;01:05:18;"That was not my experience."
01:05:18;01:05:20;"- No, I checked the forums."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"The forums I read said the opposite."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"They were like, ""This was a better crowd"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"""than the San Diego show the night before."""
01:05:26;01:05:28;"- Hmm. - ""I heard the San Diego show"
01:05:28;01:05:30;"""was subdued. I heard that this crowd"
01:05:30;01:05:32;"""was pretty lively and energetic."""
01:05:32;01:05:34;"Yeah, around me, everyone was, like, on their feet,"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"headbanging when appropriate."
01:05:36;01:05:38;"- Yeah, it seemed like everybody there was having a ball."
01:05:38;01:05:40;"- Yeah, it was a good time."
01:05:40;01:05:42;"And I could see down in the pit, there was no--"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"obviously, people don't mosh anymore at these shows."
01:05:44;01:05:46;"But... - Yeah, maybe a bit of, like,"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"head-- dramatic head movements."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"- Yeah. - No moshing."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"One more question for you."
01:05:52;01:05:54;"Even though you've seen Pearl Jam 12 times,"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"are there any songs that you're chasing"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"or that you're dying to see one more time?"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"- Oh, yeah, because with ""No Code"""
01:06:00;01:06:02;"being my favorite album,"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"""Hail, Hail,"" track two off that album,"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"one of my favorites,"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"didn't play it, haven't seen it on"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"any of the recent setlists."
01:06:10;01:06:12;"But yeah, I'd chase that one for sure."
01:06:12;01:06:14;"- But that's the type of song they'll definitely drop"
01:06:14;01:06:16;"a few times on this tour, right?"
01:06:16;01:06:18;"It's not like they go years without playing it?"
01:06:18;01:06:20;"- It seems like it's a song they played frequently."
01:06:20;01:06:22;"I checked the setlists."
01:06:22;01:06:24;"I think they've done four or five shows so far."
01:06:24;01:06:26;"It hasn't appeared yet."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"May have been, you know, retired for this tour."
01:06:28;01:06:30;"But yeah, it seems like a standard."
01:06:30;01:06:32;"Yeah, I'd want to hear it."
01:06:32;01:06:34;"- I got one last question."
01:06:34;01:06:36;"What's the most memorable cover that you've seen them play?"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"- One time I saw them open for"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"the Rolling Stones. - Whoa."
01:06:40;01:06:42;"- At the Oakland Coliseum."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"'97. They played four nights in a row,"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"opening for the Stones,"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"and they covered ""Beast of Burden."""
01:06:48;01:06:50;"- Whoa."
01:06:50;01:06:52;"- That's cool. - Covering the band."
01:06:52;01:06:54;"- I think"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"they said something before, like,"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"""We checked with the Stones to make sure they weren't going to play this one"
01:06:58;01:07:00;"tonight, and we're going to play it."""
01:07:00;01:07:02;"- That was the first thing that came to mind."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"- That's the first time I've seen a band"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"cover the band they're playing with."
01:07:06;01:07:08;"- That's a cool move. - Yeah."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"- Bands should do that more."
01:07:10;01:07:12;"- My first thought, before you told me that they"
01:07:12;01:07:14;"said it in the banter, was,"
01:07:14;01:07:16;"as you described it, I could already have an image"
01:07:16;01:07:18;"in my head of Eddie"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"knocking on Mick's door and just being like,"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"""Now, Mick, I wanted to run."
01:07:22;01:07:24;"I'm a huge fan, first of all,"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"carrying, like, a few records,"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"and I'd love for you to sign this copy of Goat's Head Soup,"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"but also,"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"this idea. I will spike it immediately"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"if you have any problem with it,"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"but we want to play Beast of Burden."
01:07:36;01:07:38;"Guy's worked up a pretty solid cover."
01:07:38;01:07:40;"What do you say?"""
01:07:40;01:07:42;"Mick was just like, ""Yeah, alright, alright."
01:07:42;01:07:44;"It's fine, it's fine."
01:07:44;01:07:46;"Yeah, we're not going to play it."""
01:07:46;01:07:48;"Eddie seems like he's such a reverent, fan-type"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"dude. - Yeah."
01:07:50;01:07:52;"- I couldn't picture him, like, trolling"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"the Stones. - Yeah, wouldn't do it without their"
01:07:54;01:07:56;"permission, for sure. - I wonder if he went"
01:07:56;01:07:58;"individually to each member of the band."
01:07:58;01:08:00;"Knocked on Ronnie's door."
01:08:00;01:08:02;"Got a minute? - That's, I mean, there's"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"a legend that, like, the bad blood"
01:08:04;01:08:06;"between Nirvana and Pearl Jam"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"came from, uh,"
01:08:08;01:08:10;"there was a legendary"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"show, uh, the Chili Peppers,"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"Nirvana, and Pearl Jam, but the Cow Palace"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"in San Francisco. - Ah, I've heard about that tour. - I was not"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"there, but Pearl Jam was the first"
01:08:18;01:08:20;"band on, and as a joke, they"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"covered, like, a minute of Smells Like Teen Spirit."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"- Ah. Eddie learned"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"his lesson. - Yeah, and I think"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"that Nirvana was not cool with that."
01:08:28;01:08:30;"Uh, and that may have..."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"There was already, you know, some"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"- Tension. - Yeah,"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"tension between the two bands. - Yeah."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"- And that didn't help things. - Kurt was famously"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"not a fan. - Famously, yeah, yeah."
01:08:40;01:08:42;"- Always ask when you're gonna cover"
01:08:42;01:08:44;"the Headliners song."
01:08:44;01:08:46;"Even if it's just a little tease."
01:08:46;01:08:48;"Alright, well, thanks so much, Alex, for calling in."
01:08:48;01:08:50;"- Thanks for having me on, guys."
01:08:50;01:08:52;"- Yeah, we'll definitely have you back in the future,"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"and, um, if you catch any"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"DJ shows over the next few months on this tour,"
01:08:56;01:08:58;"let us know. We'll be back sooner rather than later."
01:08:58;01:09:00;"- Yeah, I'll call in from the road, yeah."
01:09:00;01:09:02;"- Alright, have a good one, man."
01:09:02;01:09:04;"- Thanks, later, guys. - Peace."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"- Peace."
01:09:10;01:09:20;"It's broke off, but it's a hurt All I want for you to make love to me"
01:09:20;01:09:33;"Oh, I'd, I'd never be your beast to burn I'd walk for miles, but my feet would hurt"
01:09:33;01:09:40;"All I want for you to make love to me"
01:09:40;01:09:53;"Am I hard enough? Am I rough enough? Am I rich enough? I'm not too blind to see"
01:09:53;01:10:01;"As is often the case in this era of time crisis, we like to cover Pearl Jam and horse meat."
01:10:01;01:10:07;"That's our bread and butter. People wanted us to stop talking about the Grateful Dead and Flaming Hot Cheetos."
01:10:07;01:10:12;"Well, guess what? Here you go. Pearl Jam and horse meat."
01:10:12;01:10:22;"I don't want to actually put in too much work to do it, but sometimes when there's a, I come across a phrase that has like four syllables,"
01:10:22;01:10:33;"I like to do it to the tune of, remember that Fat Joe song, The Rockaway that has the part."
01:10:33;01:10:40;"So anyway, we're talking about Starbucks horse meat, so I can't help but want to go Starbucks horse meat."
01:10:40;01:10:51;"I don't know that song. You don't remember? Throw on The Rockaway real quick. Oh, it's called Lean Back."
01:10:51;01:10:52;"Lean Back."
01:10:52;01:10:59;"Bucks horse meat."
01:10:59;01:11:07;"I think you said this was a Billy Joel song. No, Fat Joe."
01:11:07;01:11:12;"Here, throw it on for the beginning again. One more time. I'll get it right."
01:11:14;01:11:21;"Bucks horse meat. Starbucks horse meat."
01:11:21;01:11:34;"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Kazakhstan, where you can get a horse meat salad at Starbucks."
01:11:36;01:11:46;"And to all the Americans hating, because you can't get horse meat at your Starbucks or any restaurant. Keep your comments to yourself."
01:11:47;01:11:51;"We from the Bronx, New York. Kids clapping. Let us walk the place."
01:11:51;01:11:58;"Half the *** in the squad got a scar on their face. It's a cold world and this is ice. Half a mil for the chump. This is life."
01:11:58;01:12:03;"Got the Phantom in front of the building. Trinity, yeah. Ten years, been legit. They still figure me bad."
01:12:03;01:12:09;"As a young ***, was too much to cope with. Why you think? Mom *** nicknamed me Coochie Coochie."
01:12:09;01:12:16;"Should have been called armed robbery, stall **** or maybe grand larceny. I did it all to put the pieces to the puzzle."
01:12:16;01:12:21;"This is long. I knew me and my people was gun bubble. Came out the gate, known as the flow Joe."
01:12:21;01:12:28;"Fat **** with the shot, he was the logo kid. Said my *** don't dance, we just pull up our pants and do the rockaway."
01:12:28;01:12:38;"Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back. I said my *** don't dance, we just pull up our pants and do the rockaway."
01:12:38;01:12:44;"Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back."
01:12:44;01:12:54;"This is very interesting because there's actually quite a bit happening with Starbucks. I don't know if you saw that what went down with the actor James Cromwell in New
York."
01:12:54;01:13:02;"No, I did not see. Seinfeld, can we get a scene report from the New York Starbucks where James Cromwell protested?"
01:13:02;01:13:16;"Sure, yeah, I'm on the site right now at the Starbucks in New York where actor James Cromwell, who plays Uncle Ewan on Succession, glued his hand to a counter at
Starbucks."
01:13:16;01:13:26;"This was in protest of Starbucks is extra charge for plant based milk. Now, James Cromwell did not do this on his own."
01:13:26;01:13:34;"He didn't do this solo. This was part of a protest organized by the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals."
01:13:34;01:13:45;"That's PETA for short. Apparently, the increased price for plant based milk is seen as a deterrent from buying plant based milk."
01:13:45;01:13:55;"So that's what they were protesting. The additional price is a way to sway people towards still buying animal based milk."
01:13:55;01:14:00;"So that's what happened. There is a line in this article that's pretty interesting."
01:14:00;01:14:05;"Cromwell glued his hand to the counter, then later used a knife to scrape it off."
01:14:05;01:14:11;"Police said there were no arrests. So that's pretty hardcore. Super glue."
01:14:11;01:14:16;"It's like chaining yourself to a tree before they can cut it down."
01:14:16;01:14:23;"Was it really super glue? Because if you super glued your hand to a counter, that'd be like crazy, right? You might lose skin."
01:14:23;01:14:29;"I mean, this article, NPR that I'm reading, they use the word super glue, but here's how they say it."
01:14:29;01:14:36;"They say actor James Cromwell has gone from Succession's Uncle Ewan to real life super glue-in."
01:14:36;01:14:39;"They put a little rhyme in there."
01:14:39;01:14:41;"Real life super glue-in."
01:14:41;01:14:47;"Yeah. Now that's the only place where I can see that it was super glue. Maybe there are other articles."
01:14:47;01:14:50;"Yeah. I mean, all the headlines say super glued."
01:14:50;01:14:53;"Super glued. Well, all right."
01:14:53;01:14:54;"Was he by himself?"
01:14:54;01:15:10;"He was with another activist. But I got to say, the reason I think of it is because it's an interesting juxtaposition that in the US you have a PETA activist, like actor
James Cromwell, super gluing their hand and doing this kind of intense thing"
01:15:10;01:15:16;"because they think it's wrong that they charge more for nut milks than they do for cow's milk."
01:15:16;01:15:22;"But I wonder if he's even aware that out in Kazakhstan, Starbucks serves horse meat."
01:15:22;01:15:26;"He's going to need a lot of super glue when he hears about this."
01:15:26;01:15:34;"He's going to be rolling out like 10, 20 activists deep, just full body super glue at every Starbucks in Kazakhstan."
01:15:34;01:15:52;"I heard about this because my friend Laura saw that on Instagram somebody was traveling and they took a picture of the kind of, you know, deli counter, you know, the
little fridge in front of the counter at a Starbucks in Kazakhstan where they were serving salad with horse meat."
01:15:52;01:15:58;"So, she sent me the little picture, salad with horse meat. And I was like, for real? Wow."
01:15:58;01:16:04;"Of course, I'm very aware as a horse meat entrepreneur that horse meat is sold all over the world."
01:16:04;01:16:12;"But I was still kind of surprised that an American company like Starbucks, even in a different region, would be selling horse meat."
01:16:12;01:16:20;"I was very fascinated by it. And then we did some research and not only do they sell horse meat salads, they sell horse meat sandwiches."
01:16:20;01:16:24;"So, they're really all in on horse meat in Kazakhstan."
01:16:24;01:16:36;"We looked at a trip advisor for one Kazakhstan Starbucks and some of the travelers said it's a really good option."
01:16:36;01:16:39;"Bread is freshly baked. The horse meat sandwich is pretty good."
01:16:39;01:16:40;"Pretty good."
01:16:40;01:16:47;"They have chicken sandwiches and horse meat sandwiches, which is maybe how it should be in the U.S. too."
01:16:47;01:16:54;"But yeah, I gotta say, I'd be very surprised if you told me McDonald's was serving horse meat anywhere in the world. Maybe I'm wrong."
01:16:54;01:17:00;"You would think Starbucks corporate would be afraid that this would blow back on them on the internet."
01:17:00;01:17:07;"And they'd be like, would call the Kazakhstan regional manager and be like, we gotta cool it with the horse meat."
01:17:07;01:17:14;"I mean, good for them for being brave. Because obviously, there's a huge bias against horse meat in the U.S."
01:17:14;01:17:23;"The current administration, Joe Biden, was very involved in banning it. He and his brother, very anti-horse meat."
01:17:23;01:17:32;"So, you know, Starbucks is not afraid to make a political statement by saying, hey, we can't serve it in America, but we're going to serve it in Kazakhstan because
that's how we roll."
01:17:32;01:17:41;"Starbucks is pro-horse meat. I doubt any of the other giant American global chains, Subway, Burger King, KFC are doing horse meat anywhere."
01:17:41;01:17:50;"Unless Seinfeld. Can you find anything? I think Starbucks might be one of the only pro-horse meat American fast food chains."
01:17:50;01:17:55;"Yeah, I mean, there was that incident at IKEA where horse meat was discovered in the meatballs."
01:17:55;01:17:59;"But I think they were like quick to, they were like, oh, no, no, no, no, no."
01:17:59;01:18:05;"That was, yeah, that was a mistake. Like a horse fell in. Like they weren't like, you know, they weren't owning it."
01:18:05;01:18:13;"I'm sorry, but if you order meatballs, you should assume it's some mix of various meats, including horse meat."
01:18:13;01:18:16;"You're going to get a hodgepodge. Everybody knows that. It's in the name."
01:18:16;01:18:23;"In my life, I operate by every time I eat a meatball, I assume there's horse meat in it unless proven otherwise."
01:18:23;01:18:27;"Horse meat until proven guilty is how you're."
01:18:27;01:18:37;"I found an article, but I found an article, but it's sort of like all about like, oops, like similar to IKEA, like Taco Bell accidentally had a horse meat thing."
01:18:37;01:18:44;"Burger King. Accidental horse meat. Damn. The new album from Guided by Voices."
01:18:44;01:18:49;"Accidental horse meat."
01:18:49;01:18:54;"Nobody's really owning it. No, I don't think there's a chain that's really like."
01:18:54;01:18:58;"Starbucks is the only company doing purposeful horse meat."
01:18:58;01:19:03;"Proudly doing horse meat. Owning it. Living it."
01:19:03;01:19:09;"You could imagine Howard Schultz of Starbucks when he heard about the James Cromwell thing saying,"
01:19:09;01:19:13;"you're really complaining that we charged a quarter more for coconut milk."
01:19:13;01:19:17;"You think I give a **** about you super gluing your hand? Mother******."
01:19:17;01:19:21;"My company serves horse meat. I'm giving zero ****."
01:19:21;01:19:26;"By the way, like, again, just to go back to that little two line sort of snapshot of what happened."
01:19:26;01:19:30;"Cromwell glued his hand to the counter, then later used a knife to scrape it off."
01:19:30;01:19:35;"Police said there were no arrests. So in other words, Cromwell glues his hand to the counter."
01:19:35;01:19:40;"Everybody kind of goes like, all right, like it doesn't just doesn't sound like a rowdy protest."
01:19:40;01:19:47;"It sounds like he sort of sat there with his hand glued and then eventually nothing like police didn't apprehend anybody."
01:19:47;01:19:51;"And he goes, OK, well, I guess that's, you know, enough time has passed."
01:19:51;01:19:54;"I'm going to now scrape this off by myself in front of everybody."
01:19:54;01:19:58;"It just seems like a little bit of a peaceful protest."
01:19:58;01:20:03;"Oh, yeah, it's totally with a dramatic. OK, to be fair, here we are talking about it."
01:20:03;01:20:08;"I had no idea that Starbucks charges more for nut milks."
01:20:08;01:20:12;"I would assume it just has something to do with the price of nut milks."
01:20:12;01:20:17;"But maybe James Cromwell's point is I don't care if the nut milk costs you more. Make it the same."
01:20:17;01:20:23;"Charge the same. And it's 50 cents more for the plant based than the nut based."
01:20:23;01:20:27;"Per drink. Like a 12 ounce cup."
01:20:27;01:20:34;"Breaking news. Starbucks now to charge 50 cents for cow's milk."
01:20:34;01:20:38;"Not to dwell on this, but it just feels like what I'm trying to say is like Jane Fonda."
01:20:38;01:20:45;"Like, do you remember she protest? She was arrested a couple of years ago for like protesting on the Capitol steps or something like that."
01:20:45;01:20:50;"It was a big thing. It just feels like this was maybe a little bit more anticlimactic than that."
01:20:50;01:20:54;"There was no lower stakes. That's that's kind of what I'm. But but you're right."
01:20:54;01:20:58;"We're talking about it. I'm picturing him with his hands stuck to the counter."
01:20:58;01:21:03;"And after it's been like 40 minutes, people coming in and being like, is that the actor?"
01:21:03;01:21:08;"What's his name? James Cromwell, sir. Are you all right? Then he's like, he's a pretty old guy, too."
01:21:08;01:21:11;"He's probably. Yeah, he's got one hand on the counter."
01:21:11;01:21:15;"Maybe it looks like he's probably leaning on the counter, like supporting himself."
01:21:15;01:21:23;"Like, well, he was, you know, he was also reading a kind of like statement and he's wearing like a T-shirt, a PETA T-shirt."
01:21:23;01:21:29;"So I saw the video on his phone. Right. Yeah. I don't know if eventually things calm down."
01:21:29;01:21:33;"You just sitting there. The most interesting thing about. Are you in line? Props to him."
01:21:33;01:21:41;"He's doing his thing. One of the most interesting things I found about the video is he's so he's sitting there on the counter and like right in front of the cash registers."
01:21:41;01:21:50;"And you just see the people who work there kind of confused and they're just trying to direct people saying, yeah, I can take your order over here because like they just
can't stop working."
01:21:50;01:21:55;"So they're just a little bit like, yeah, how can I help you? And it's just a kind of an awkward scene."
01:21:55;01:22:03;"Starbucks and the vegan upcharge. Accidental horse meat, vegan upcharge. The vegan upcharge."
01:22:03;01:22:12;"That was accidental horse meat with the vegan upcharge."
01:22:12;01:22:21;"The vegan upcharge. Well, now everybody knows that Starbucks is anti-vegan and pro-horse meat."
01:22:21;01:22:28;"So make of that what you will. We're not judging. It's a crazy world. You do what you got to do, Starbucks."
01:22:28;01:22:30;"All right, let's get in the top five."
01:22:30;01:22:37;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:22:37;01:22:48;"OK, so this week on the top five, we're comparing the top five songs of today with the top five Billboard hits this week in 1991."
01:22:48;01:22:51;"Is that correct? Yep. Why 1991?"
01:22:51;01:22:58;"Even flow. Gotta rise like butterflies."
01:22:58;01:23:01;"What's he saying there? Gotta rise like butterflies?"
01:23:01;01:23:06;"I think so. That's the year that Ten came out. 31 years ago."
01:23:06;01:23:13;"So your Pearl Jam hit the scene with their hit album Ten. The number five song this week."
01:23:13;01:23:22;"So actually, you know, just to be clear, because we're doing 91 and it's May, we're kind of jumping into the time just before Ten came out."
01:23:22;01:23:28;"So this is like we can kind of imagine this is what 1991 was like before Nirvana."
01:23:28;01:23:35;"Well, before Nevermind, before Ten by Pearl Jam, before Blood Sugar Sex Magic. All those albums came out towards the end of the year."
01:23:35;01:23:41;"I think before Metallica Black Album too. Wow. OK, so we're still in the 80s, basically."
01:23:41;01:23:49;"Yeah, it's May 91. It could be 89. Bill Clinton wasn't president yet. Yeah. George H.W. Bush."
01:23:49;01:23:55;"OK, the number five song this week, 91, Kathy Dennis with Touch Me All Night Long."
01:23:55;01:24:00;"Have you ever heard of Kathy Dennis? Not familiar. Never heard of her."
01:24:00;01:24:11;"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Good vibe."
01:24:11;01:24:18;"You know, the song is over. Oh, interesting."
01:24:18;01:24:22;"Kathy Dennis went on to become a very successful songwriter for other artists."
01:24:22;01:24:30;"She worked on Toxic for Britney Spears, Can't Get You Out of My Head for Carly Minogue and I Kissed a Girl for Katy Perry."
01:24:30;01:24:48;"All right."
01:24:48;01:24:52;"Still kind of feels like the 80s. Yeah. 80s dance hit."
01:24:52;01:24:58;"Like if I just heard this and someone was like, guess the year, I'd be like 1988."
01:24:58;01:25:12;"Yeah, I would say 89."
01:25:12;01:25:19;"This is funny because it's like it's kind of like club music, but above all, it has like mall energy."
01:25:19;01:25:30;"Yeah, there's a little bit of like a kind of Debbie Gibbs and Tiffany feel with like the vocals and the songwriting over like the light club music."
01:25:30;01:25:38;"Kind of has like a Japanese feel. I feel like if you're watching like an old anime and if it was in Japanese, this would be like the outro music."
01:25:38;01:25:43;"All right, let's keep moving. The number five song this week, Lady Gaga Withhold My Hand."
01:25:43;01:25:47;"Oh, you know, I've been wanting to hear this song. Hello, old friend."
01:25:47;01:25:59;"And this is also co-written and co-produced by my dear friend Blood Pop."
01:25:59;01:26:06;"So this is from the first single from the new Top Gun soundtrack."
01:26:06;01:26:10;"This guy has 1991 energy so far."
01:26:10;01:26:17;"I see that you're hurting. Why'd you take so long to tell me you need me?"
01:26:17;01:26:24;"I see that you're bleeding. You don't need to show me again."
01:26:24;01:26:30;"But if you decide to, I'll ride in this life with you."
01:26:30;01:26:36;"I won't let go till the end."
01:26:36;01:26:41;"So fly tonight."
01:26:41;01:26:45;"OK, definitely 80s throwback chorus."
01:26:45;01:26:50;"Yeah, going first. Well, I guess because they need to deliver a ""take my breath away""."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"Right."
01:26:51;01:26:56;"I won't leave till I understand."
01:26:56;01:27:00;"Promise me just hold my hand."
01:27:00;01:27:06;"Raise your head. Look into my wishful eyes."
01:27:06;01:27:11;"That fear that's inside you will lift again in time."
01:27:11;01:27:13;"I like the vibe."
01:27:13;01:27:17;"Combining a kind of 80s grandeur with like a modern pop sensibility."
01:27:17;01:27:24;"It's tough, though, because the movie's a throwback to the big 80s hit with the iconic ""take my breath away""."
01:27:24;01:27:34;"It's like if you're going to be dipping your toes into those waters of 80s, it's hard for me not just to want to hear ""take my breath away""."
01:27:34;01:27:36;"Well, let's not take my breath away."
01:27:36;01:27:48;"I just kind of want to hear that."
01:27:48;01:27:53;"Watching every motion in my foolish love's hand."
01:27:53;01:27:56;"See, yeah, they're going for almost like kind of like a big pop metal thing."
01:27:56;01:28:00;"The thing about Berlin is that they're a new wave band."
01:28:00;01:28:03;"I love their early shit, like that song ""The Metro""."
01:28:03;01:28:05;"Oh, I don't know that stuff."
01:28:05;01:28:08;"Oh, yeah, it's like cool."
01:28:08;01:28:15;"Turning every turn into some secret place inside."
01:28:15;01:28:16;"Beautiful song."
01:28:16;01:28:25;"Yeah."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"Did the band Berlin write this song?"
01:28:27;01:28:32;"Take my breath away."
01:28:32;01:28:36;"Oh, this song was written by Giorgio Moroder."
01:28:36;01:28:37;"Oh, the whole song?"
01:28:37;01:28:38;"Yeah, the whole song."
01:28:38;01:28:39;"From Whitlock."
01:28:39;01:28:55;"Wow, Giorgio Moroder, what a guy."
01:28:55;01:29:08;"Got to rewatch ""Top Gun""."
01:29:08;01:29:10;"Jake, are you going to go see the new ""Top Gun""?"
01:29:10;01:29:11;"No."
01:29:11;01:29:13;"I'm hearing word that it rules."
01:29:13;01:29:14;"Have you heard that?"
01:29:14;01:29:16;"I wasn't a fan of the first one, really."
01:29:16;01:29:23;"I don't -- I'm really not that interested, but I'll probably see it on HBO Max like a month after it comes out."
01:29:23;01:29:25;"I'm behind on movies, man."
01:29:25;01:29:26;"I haven't seen the new ""Batman""."
01:29:26;01:29:30;"I haven't seen everything, everywhere, all at once."
01:29:30;01:29:32;"I haven't seen ""The Northmen""."
01:29:32;01:29:33;"Oh, I saw that the other night."
01:29:33;01:29:34;"Oh, which one?"
01:29:34;01:29:35;"Last night."
01:29:35;01:29:36;"Which one?"
01:29:36;01:29:37;"""Northmen""."
01:29:37;01:29:38;"Ezra, you see ""Northmen""?"
01:29:38;01:29:41;"I saw all three of those movies, Jake, in theaters."
01:29:41;01:29:42;"Oh, [bleep] man."
01:29:42;01:29:43;"I can't get it in my schedule."
01:29:43;01:29:46;"I mean, as discussed, I got a looser schedule."
01:29:46;01:29:47;"Yeah."
01:29:47;01:29:49;"You got detail-oriented."
01:29:49;01:29:55;"I've also increasingly, when my schedule changes or when I realize I have some time free during the day,"
01:29:55;01:30:01;"now I'm just in this kind of -- after having not done it for a while, I'm getting into this zone of just like, ""I'm going to go to the movies."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"I'll go solo."
01:30:03;01:30:04;"I'll go with a friend if they're around."""
01:30:04;01:30:06;"Dude, it's awesome."
01:30:06;01:30:07;"I mean, I'm jealous."
01:30:07;01:30:12;"If I didn't have such a kind of intense deadline situation with paintings,"
01:30:12;01:30:21;"I would totally go with you at 2 in the afternoon on a Tuesday to the Glendale Galleria and see ""The Northmen."""
01:30:21;01:30:23;"After you finish your next big show."
01:30:23;01:30:25;"Yeah, we'll get there."
01:30:25;01:30:29;"We're hitting some Tuesday 1/15 film screenings."
01:30:29;01:30:30;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:30:30;01:30:32;"Seinfeld, did you like ""The Northmen""?"
01:30:32;01:30:42;"You know, I saw it very late with some friends, and I was -- you ever go to see a movie very tired?"
01:30:42;01:30:44;"What time was the screening?"
01:30:44;01:30:45;"Did you fall asleep?"
01:30:45;01:30:50;"Honestly, this hasn't happened to me in a long time, but I was a little bit in and out of sleep."
01:30:50;01:30:53;"And I was forcing myself to try to stay awake."
01:30:53;01:30:54;"I was very tired that day."
01:30:54;01:31:00;"The screening was -- we went to a 10 p.m. show at -- yeah, 10 to 12."
01:31:00;01:31:02;"Oh, dude."
01:31:02;01:31:04;"Tuesday night."
01:31:04;01:31:06;"That's wild."
01:31:06;01:31:10;"I saw a morning show of ""The Northmen"" just jacked up on coffee."
01:31:10;01:31:11;"Oh, yeah."
01:31:11;01:31:13;"No, I was the opposite end of that spectrum."
01:31:13;01:31:19;"It was at TCL Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard, which also added a little bit of --"
01:31:19;01:31:20;"Hectic."
01:31:20;01:31:23;"I don't know, a little hectic, a little extra exhaustion."
01:31:23;01:31:25;"Well, that's an interesting movie to be in and out of sleep of."
01:31:25;01:31:30;"And on the one hand, it's a pretty mainstream Viking movie, blood and gore and action."
01:31:30;01:31:36;"But it's also, as many people know, the director is -- he's coming from a slightly more artistic place."
01:31:36;01:31:40;"And it's very surreal and trippy."
01:31:40;01:31:43;"There's some drug ceremonial moments."
01:31:43;01:31:46;"The entire score is just big movie drums, but also like --"
01:31:46;01:31:49;"[imitates drum roll]"
01:31:49;01:31:51;"Like drones?"
01:31:51;01:31:52;"Yeah, weird drones."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"Like Sicario-style?"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"Very intense."
01:31:55;01:31:57;"Bjork was cool in it."
01:31:57;01:32:00;"I liked Bjork's appearances."
01:32:00;01:32:02;"It was like the perfect role for her."
01:32:02;01:32:03;"I want to see the movie."
01:32:03;01:32:05;"I mean, I just hate hearing this."
01:32:05;01:32:06;"I'm very jealous."
01:32:06;01:32:07;"Okay, I won't say any more."
01:32:07;01:32:11;"The one thing I'll say about ""Batman"" -- I always like going to the movies."
01:32:11;01:32:14;"I've never walked out of a movie in my life."
01:32:14;01:32:15;"Agreed."
01:32:15;01:32:16;"Good, bad, whatever."
01:32:16;01:32:17;"I'm happy to be there."
01:32:17;01:32:20;"It's meditative, going to darkroom."
01:32:20;01:32:23;"The one thing I'll say about ""Batman"" -- three hours long."
01:32:23;01:32:25;"Literally, three full hours."
01:32:25;01:32:28;"Longer than a PJ show in 2022."
01:32:28;01:32:30;"You're not getting a PJ show that long."
01:32:30;01:32:34;"I'm sorry, but I just don't believe that ""Batman"" movies should be longer than Pearl Jam shows."
01:32:34;01:32:36;"What is going on with 2022?"
01:32:36;01:32:38;"Could this year suck any worse?"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"That's a really solid policy."
01:32:40;01:32:43;"Now, this year's okay, but I don't like where culture's heading"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"when ""Batman"" movies are longer than PJ shows."
01:32:45;01:32:48;"I've only walked out of one movie in my life, and I'll tell you,"
01:32:48;01:32:54;"I was 14 years old, and I saw a matinee screening of ""12 Monkeys"" with Bruce Willis,"
01:32:54;01:32:58;"which I know is a great film, but at the time, I was like,"
01:32:58;01:33:02;"""You know when you're young and you're not acclimated to--?"""
01:33:02;01:33:07;"I was into Ace Ventura and stuff, and then I'm like, ""12 Monkeys"" was so depressing,"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"and I was like, ""I can't deal with this."""
01:33:09;01:33:11;"Wow, it was too hard for you."
01:33:11;01:33:16;"It was monochromatic and very bleak, and I was just like, ""This is making me sad."""
01:33:16;01:33:18;"Okay. Well, I respect--"
01:33:18;01:33:20;"You have to get out. I was 14. Keep that in mind."
01:33:20;01:33:23;"I respect walking out of a movie because it makes you sad."
01:33:23;01:33:27;"Walking out of a movie because it sucks, I don't respect."
01:33:27;01:33:30;"Because sometimes life sucks, and you can't walk out of that."
01:33:30;01:33:32;"That's my two cents."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"Damn, that's deep."
01:33:34;01:33:36;"Let's get back to the top five."
01:33:36;01:33:41;"The number four song this week in 91, ""CNC Music Factory"""
01:33:41;01:33:43;"with ""Here We Go, Let's Rock and Roll."""
01:33:43;01:33:45;"I mean, I know ""CNC Music Factory."" I don't know--"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"This title."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"This is 1957?"
01:33:49;01:33:55;"The ""CNC Music Factory"" is like dance music."
01:33:55;01:34:03;"This sounds great."
01:34:03;01:34:09;"That kind of metal guitar in the beginning was like,"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"""Oh, you thought we were going to actually make some rock and roll?"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"No, that s--t sucks. Here's some good music."""
01:34:13;01:34:34;"Oh, man. That--"
01:34:34;01:34:37;"Those power chords. Yeah."
01:34:40;01:34:43;"Okay, this is not ""CNC Music Factory's"" best song."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"Yeah, kind of filler."
01:34:45;01:34:55;"This guy also reminds me of Ice-T."
01:34:55;01:34:58;"Yeah, yeah. He sounds like Ice-T."
01:34:58;01:35:01;"I think in my head I always thought it was Ice-T."
01:35:01;01:35:05;"I mean, I knew it wasn't, but when I would hear ""CNC Music Factory,"""
01:35:05;01:35:07;"I'd be like, ""Ice-T isn't his band."""
01:35:07;01:35:12;"You know what I think is a slightly better 1991 combination"
01:35:12;01:35:14;"of rock and dance music?"
01:35:14;01:35:16;"""Black and White"" by Michael Jackson."
01:35:16;01:35:22;"Same vibe."
01:35:22;01:35:24;"What year was the ""Judgment Night"" sound--"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"That was a little later. That was like '93."
01:35:26;01:35:28;"Oh, yeah. A little bit later."
01:35:28;01:35:30;"All right, let's keep moving. The number four song this week."
01:35:30;01:35:32;"Yeah. Yeah?"
01:35:32;01:35:35;"I was going to say, in some other episode, we could do the ""Judgment Night"" soundtrack."
01:35:35;01:35:37;"We could listen to the entire soundtrack."
01:35:37;01:35:39;"Oh, classic. Yeah, I only know a few songs off of it."
01:35:39;01:35:41;"I've never gone-- Yeah, I don't really know it."
01:35:41;01:35:45;"I know the ""Teenage Fan Club,"" ""De La Soul Song,"" ""Fallen,"""
01:35:45;01:35:47;"the ""Sonic Youth"" and ""Cypress Hill."""
01:35:47;01:35:51;"Number four, Taylor Swift, ""This Love,"" Taylor's version."
01:35:51;01:35:55;"So this is a single she re-recorded"
01:35:55;01:35:58;"from her hit album, ""1989."""
01:35:58;01:36:02;"Remember the conversation we had when she first started doing her Taylor's version of stuff?"
01:36:02;01:36:03;"Yeah."
01:36:03;01:36:06;"I think about that a lot because"
01:36:06;01:36:10;"we were talking about how people have tried to re-record music throughout history"
01:36:10;01:36:12;"and it almost never works."
01:36:12;01:36:13;"Right."
01:36:13;01:36:15;"Because it doesn't sound anything like it."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"And only in this century"
01:36:17;01:36:18;"Yeah."
01:36:18;01:36:21;"can somebody reproduce their music so faithfully"
01:36:21;01:36:24;"because they can use the same sounds. It's all digital."
01:36:24;01:36:28;"And anytime I hear anybody talk about, like, culture being stuck"
01:36:28;01:36:31;"or, like, there being no ideas,"
01:36:31;01:36:34;"I just always think, like, ""Well, yeah, it's technology."""
01:36:34;01:36:39;"We're in this moment where you're never far away from anything anymore."
01:36:39;01:36:42;"Right. I mean, the technology is improving every year,"
01:36:42;01:36:45;"but it's basically improving on last year's model."
01:36:45;01:36:48;"So it's the same aesthetic."
01:36:48;01:36:51;"Whereas, yeah, in the 1670s, it would be wild."
01:36:51;01:36:55;"Like, yeah, Beatles starting on a four-track and ending on a 16-track."
01:36:55;01:36:56;"Right."
01:36:56;01:36:59;"Yeah, any number of, like, innovations are happening."
01:36:59;01:37:03;"The Beatles could not re-record their music from the '60s"
01:37:03;01:37:07;"in a convincing way because technology was different"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"and it made time feel different."
01:37:09;01:37:11;"So this is no knock to Taylor Swift."
01:37:11;01:37:14;"It's, like, pretty amazing that she can do this."
01:37:14;01:37:17;"But it's just, like, technology, time,"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"this weird century we're in,"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"it all kind of goes together."
01:37:21;01:37:24;"Well, she's also re-recording this stuff, like, hilariously,"
01:37:24;01:37:27;"like, soon after she made the original recordings"
01:37:27;01:37:30;"because I feel like we've talked about"
01:37:30;01:37:36;"Def Leppard re-recording ""Hysteria,"" like, 25 years after they did it."
01:37:36;01:37:38;"And it's just, like, they can't--"
01:37:38;01:37:40;"Technology aside, like, as humans,"
01:37:40;01:37:43;"I don't think they could, like, recreate that."
01:37:43;01:37:44;"No, sir."
01:37:44;01:37:47;"And I don't think Taylor could re-record this"
01:37:47;01:37:50;"as convincingly in, like, 20 years."
01:37:50;01:37:51;"Right."
01:37:51;01:37:54;"But this is, like, what? Like, when is this album from?"
01:37:54;01:37:56;"I think this is, like, eight years old."
01:37:56;01:37:58;"This is from, like, 2015 or '16 or something?"
01:37:58;01:37:59;"Seven or eight years old."
01:37:59;01:38:00;"Yeah, yeah."
01:38:00;01:38:01;"Not that long."
01:38:01;01:38:04;"Also, it's a good way to get your songs back in the top five."
01:38:04;01:38:05;"Yeah."
01:38:05;01:38:07;"If you're a superstar."
01:38:32;01:38:36;"Back to 1991. This is ""High Five"" with ""I Like the Way,"""
01:38:36;01:38:38;"the kissing game."
01:38:38;01:38:43;"I don't know if I know this song."
01:38:43;01:38:46;"Very consistent palette so far of '91."
01:38:46;01:38:47;"Yeah."
01:38:47;01:38:50;"You know who would definitely know this song?"
01:38:50;01:38:52;"I do."
01:38:52;01:38:53;"[Laughs]"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"Rashida would definitely know it."
01:38:55;01:38:59;"Right. Early '90s R&B."
01:38:59;01:39:01;"Obscure."
01:39:01;01:39:02;"Well, it's not--"
01:39:02;01:39:03;"Long lost hits."
01:39:03;01:39:05;"It's produced by Teddy Riley. He's very fam--"
01:39:05;01:39:09;"I mean, I don't know how famous ""High Five"" was in '91."
01:39:15;01:39:17;"Nice long intro here."
01:39:17;01:39:19;"Yeah, surprisingly long intro."
01:39:45;01:39:47;"All right, not bad."
01:39:47;01:39:49;"All right, we got to keep moving though."
01:39:49;01:39:50;"Yeah."
01:39:50;01:39:52;"This is a Pearl Jam episode."
01:39:52;01:39:58;"The number three song this week in 2022,"
01:39:58;01:40:00;"Kendrick Lamar with ""The Heart Part V."""
01:40:00;01:40:01;"Oh, wow."
01:40:01;01:40:03;"Have you guys seen the video for this?"
01:40:03;01:40:04;"No."
01:40:04;01:40:05;"Yes."
01:40:05;01:40:07;"I didn't know he had new music out."
01:40:07;01:40:08;"It's an excellent video."
01:40:08;01:40:10;"I almost don't want to tell you what the hook is,"
01:40:10;01:40:13;"what the visual hook is, so you can just watch it because--"
01:40:13;01:40:14;"Okay."
01:40:14;01:40:17;"It's kind of fun just to see for the first time."
01:40:17;01:40:22;"I mean, the video is so kind of striking that I barely paid attention to the song."
01:41:25;01:41:26;"It's a vibey song."
01:41:26;01:41:27;"Yeah, it sounds cool."
01:41:27;01:41:33;"I feel like Kendrick's the type of artist that alternates between just like the big fat hits"
01:41:33;01:41:35;"and then the kind of like vibey--"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"You're saying he's the Pearl Jam of rap?"
01:41:37;01:41:38;"Kind of."
01:41:52;01:41:56;"I mean, like the last album, the first single was like humble."
01:41:56;01:41:58;"Really simple beat."
01:41:58;01:41:59;"Memorable hook."
01:41:59;01:42:01;"This is just a different mode."
01:42:01;01:42:04;"I like this more lush vibe, personally."
01:42:04;01:42:05;"Yeah."
01:42:05;01:42:06;"No, it's cool."
01:42:06;01:42:07;"Marvin Gaye sample."
01:42:07;01:42:10;"We listened to Marvin Gaye, I think, on the last episode."
01:42:33;01:42:37;"The number two song this week in '91, Amy Grant with ""Baby Baby."""
01:42:37;01:42:38;"I know this one."
01:42:38;01:42:40;"Oh, I remember this one."
01:42:40;01:42:45;"God, the snare tones are just, you know, every song."
01:42:53;01:42:58;"Yeah, this is also a very like consistent tone with what we've been hearing from '91."
01:42:58;01:43:01;"Kind of sweet, a little saccharine."
01:43:01;01:43:07;"Yeah, I mean, the vocals feel very like karaoke style on top of the tracks."
01:43:24;01:43:30;"So the story with Amy Grant is that she went on to have a career in Christian music."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"I really don't know."
01:43:31;01:43:34;"Well, I'm sure when she came out, this song was a huge hit."
01:43:34;01:43:42;"I imagine there was some expectation in the industry that she could have like, I don't know, like a big pop career."
01:43:42;01:43:43;"Yeah."
01:43:53;01:43:57;"So she was born in 1960, so she was 31, which is pretty old."
01:43:57;01:43:59;"Oh, she was 31 when this came out?"
01:43:59;01:44:00;"Okay."
01:44:00;01:44:01;"Yeah, 31."
01:44:01;01:44:06;"When I guess it says she wrote ""Baby Baby"" for her baby, her daughter Millie."
01:44:06;01:44:09;"She's referred to as the queen of Christian pop."
01:44:09;01:44:12;"So maybe she was already a Christian artist."
01:44:12;01:44:19;"She made her debut as a teenager and gained fame in the Christian music during the '80s with such hits as ""Father's Eyes"" and ""Angels."""
01:44:19;01:44:20;"Okay."
01:44:20;01:44:25;"This is a crossover hit from a Christian artist, not a pop star who went Christian later."
01:44:25;01:44:26;"Yeah."
01:44:26;01:44:27;"I see."
01:44:56;01:45:01;"She married Vince Gill."
01:45:01;01:45:02;"Okay."
01:45:02;01:45:04;"Vince Gill's got an incredible voice."
01:45:04;01:45:07;"You know, I'm really not that familiar with Vince Gill."
01:45:32;01:45:38;"The number two song, Nate Smith, ""With Whiskey on You."""
01:45:38;01:45:40;"It's got to be country, right?"
01:45:40;01:45:41;"Oh, definitely."
01:45:41;01:45:44;"What do you think ""Whiskey on You"" might mean?"
01:45:44;01:45:48;"Well, my first thought is, like, this round's on you, dude."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"Oh, right, right, right."
01:45:50;01:45:51;"Oh, yeah, that must be it."
01:45:51;01:45:52;"That must be it."
01:45:52;01:45:53;"You're getting this one, dude."
01:45:53;01:45:54;"You just had a huge payday."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"Whiskey's on you."
01:45:55;01:45:58;"Or, ""I spilled whiskey on you."""
01:45:58;01:45:59;"Oops."
01:45:59;01:46:00;"It's just sad."
01:46:00;01:46:04;"Oops, I spilled whiskey on you."
01:46:04;01:46:06;"It's not something that I meant to do."
01:46:06;01:46:09;"Oh, spilled whiskey on you."
01:46:09;01:46:11;"My bad."
01:46:11;01:46:14;"Whiskey on you."
01:46:14;01:46:22;"Just, like, a surprisingly detailed, very innocuous story about spilling whiskey on your friend at the bar,"
01:46:22;01:46:24;"and then the guy's like, ""Man, I just got this."
01:46:24;01:46:26;"This is a white suit."
01:46:26;01:46:29;"Okay, I'll pay for the dry cleaning."""
01:46:29;01:46:31;"""Are you going to take it to the dry cleaner?"""
01:46:31;01:46:34;"No, I thought, ""You take it to your dry cleaner."
01:46:34;01:46:37;"I'll Venmo you however much it costs."""
01:46:37;01:46:40;"Oh, so you spilled whiskey on me, and then I got to go to the dry cleaner."
01:46:40;01:46:42;"I wasn't planning on going to the dry cleaner."
01:46:42;01:46:44;"Well, what do you want me to do?"
01:46:44;01:46:46;"I don't care about the $8."
01:46:46;01:46:47;"It's more of an errand."
01:46:47;01:46:49;"I have to go to the dry cleaner."
01:46:49;01:46:51;"It's the inconvenience."
01:46:51;01:46:55;"Okay, but no, you're definitely right that this has to be about--"
01:46:55;01:46:58;"the most likely thing is that this whiskey's on you."
01:46:58;01:47:01;"I just wonder what the scenario is."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"Whiskey on me."
01:47:02;01:47:06;"All right, I know that song's about you feel bad about something."
01:47:06;01:47:07;"You're just being there for a friend."
01:47:07;01:47:08;"Whiskey on you."
01:47:08;01:47:11;"I wonder how Nate Smith's going to play this one."
01:47:11;01:47:12;"Let's listen."
01:47:21;01:47:25;"I've wasted a paycheck on whiskey and longnecks"
01:47:25;01:47:29;"Ever since you left, trying to figure this out"
01:47:29;01:47:33;"This jack I've been drinking's been wasting on thinking"
01:47:33;01:47:37;"Now I got a new reason for throwing them down"
01:47:37;01:47:42;"Light 'em up, light 'em up, hold 'em tall, hold 'em tall"
01:47:42;01:47:46;"This is what's happening, never after all"
01:47:46;01:47:49;"Ain't gonna wait one more night"
01:47:49;01:47:51;"Missing wanting you back"
01:47:51;01:47:55;"No, I ain't gonna cry another tear in this glass"
01:47:55;01:47:59;"Didn't waste any time finding somebody new"
01:47:59;01:48:04;"So I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you"
01:48:04;01:48:05;"No, I ain't--"
01:48:05;01:48:08;"Oh, I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you."
01:48:08;01:48:13;"What the hell with the lonely and the why don't you want me"
01:48:13;01:48:17;"Yeah, bartender, pour me a farewell round"
01:48:17;01:48:21;"Light 'em up, light 'em up, make 'em strong, make 'em strong"
01:48:21;01:48:25;"Tell the band that I need me a drink of song"
01:48:25;01:48:28;"Ain't gonna waste one more night"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"Missing wanting you back"
01:48:30;01:48:34;"No, I ain't gonna cry another tear in this glass"
01:48:34;01:48:38;"Didn't waste any time finding somebody new"
01:48:38;01:48:43;"So I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you"
01:48:43;01:48:47;"No, I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you"
01:48:47;01:48:51;"So I ain't gonna cry another tear in this glass"
01:48:51;01:48:55;"Didn't waste any time finding somebody new"
01:48:55;01:48:59;"So I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you"
01:48:59;01:49:03;"No, I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you"
01:49:03;01:49:07;"So I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you"
01:49:07;01:49:10;"Wasted a paycheck on whiskey and long necks"
01:49:10;01:49:13;"That's a good line, wasted a paycheck on whiskey and long necks."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"Ever since you left trying to figure this out."
01:49:15;01:49:19;"This Jack I've been drinking's been wasted on thinking."
01:49:19;01:49:23;"Now I got a new reason for throwing him down."
01:49:23;01:49:28;"So is he maybe-- he doesn't really expand on what the new reason is,"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"but I feel like maybe he's saying,"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"""I've been trying to drink to forget you,"""
01:49:32;01:49:34;"a kind of red red wine scenario,"
01:49:34;01:49:38;"but it's not working. Instead I just end up drunken in my feelings."
01:49:38;01:49:41;"So he's like, ""I tried to drink the whiskey to forget about you,"
01:49:41;01:49:44;"but instead the whiskey combined with all my painful thoughts in my brain,"
01:49:44;01:49:48;"and now I wasted the Jack. I wasted the Jack Daniels."""
01:49:48;01:49:51;"So maybe he's like, ""I'm not gonna do any more sad drinking."""
01:49:51;01:49:53;"Maybe he's getting ready to do some happy drinking."
01:49:53;01:49:57;"No, I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"No, I ain't"
01:50:02;01:50:07;"No, I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you"
01:50:07;01:50:11;"Oh, I see. He's not wasting drops at this point when it's happy."
01:50:11;01:50:14;"Yeah, it's a tiny bit unclear."
01:50:14;01:50:17;"I mean, I get the sentiment. He's basically saying,"
01:50:17;01:50:22;"""I'm done feeling sad. You moved on, so I'm gonna stop thinking about you."""
01:50:22;01:50:24;"He's gonna keep drinking whiskey."
01:50:24;01:50:27;"He's just not gonna be fixating on her."
01:50:27;01:50:29;"He's gonna be like--"
01:50:29;01:50:32;"The things on the table, the behaviors, the lifestyle hasn't changed."
01:50:32;01:50:35;"No, the lifestyle hasn't changed. The whiskey is getting downed."
01:50:35;01:50:38;"It's just he's having a mental--"
01:50:38;01:50:41;"He flipped a switch in his brain."
01:50:41;01:50:45;"He said, ""That was the last glass of whiskey I drank for you."
01:50:45;01:50:47;"This next glass of whiskey is for me."""
01:50:47;01:50:51;"It's for the future. I'm drinking this whiskey for my future."
01:50:51;01:50:55;"Yeah, because he also says, ""I ain't gonna cry another tear in this glass."""
01:50:55;01:50:58;"So he's not leaving the bar. Don't get it twisted."
01:50:58;01:51:03;"This is not a song about, ""I've been drinking to excess since you broke my heart."
01:51:03;01:51:05;"I'm gonna go home, get a good night's sleep."
01:51:05;01:51:07;"Tomorrow I'm gonna set my alarm for 6.30 a.m."
01:51:07;01:51:09;"I'm gonna get a run in."
01:51:09;01:51:11;"I'm not gonna drink for a few months. I'm gonna eat healthy."""
01:51:11;01:51:13;"No, that's not what's happening."
01:51:13;01:51:16;"""I'm gonna stay in this bar."
01:51:16;01:51:19;"Keep getting sh*t-faced, but now it's not for you."""
01:51:19;01:51:21;"Seems a little bit defensive."
01:51:21;01:51:24;"Yeah, I think that's a hard turn, though, because if you're in the zone"
01:51:24;01:51:27;"and you're crying tears over somebody drinking whiskey"
01:51:27;01:51:31;"and then you make a decision, ""Okay, these next whiskeys are gonna be happy whiskey,"""
01:51:31;01:51:33;"I think there's some bleed over."
01:51:33;01:51:36;"I don't think it's a clean switch over."
01:51:36;01:51:41;"No, no. Imagine being this guy's friend and you call him up and you're like,"
01:51:41;01:51:45;"""Where you at, man?"" He picks up and he's like, ""I'm at the bar."""
01:51:45;01:51:48;"And you're just like, ""Dude, I went to the bar with you the last two nights."
01:51:48;01:51:50;"It's Sunday night. It's kind of dark."""
01:51:50;01:51:52;"And he's like, ""Oh, no, no, no."""
01:51:52;01:51:56;"I was like, ""Man, I know you're hurting, but let's do something more positive."""
01:51:56;01:51:59;"And he's like, ""No, no, no. I'm not drinking for her anymore."""
01:51:59;01:52:01;"You're not? No, no, no."
01:52:01;01:52:02;"This is positive."
01:52:02;01:52:04;"No, no. I'm done drinking for her."
01:52:04;01:52:07;"Last night with you, I was still drinking for her."
01:52:07;01:52:08;"Now it's just for me."
01:52:08;01:52:12;"You're like, ""Okay. All right."""
01:52:12;01:52:17;"I mean, respect to Nate Smith for writing a song"
01:52:17;01:52:22;"that intricately explores this guy's interior monologue."
01:52:23;01:52:27;"You're right. He could have done a really straightforward country song"
01:52:27;01:52:29;"that was basically just like..."
01:52:29;01:52:33;"Well, there's so many classic songs that are just about like a red, red wine"
01:52:33;01:52:36;"that are basically just sitting there being like,"
01:52:36;01:52:38;"""I'm here and I'm drunk because I miss you."""
01:52:38;01:52:39;"That's what it's about."
01:52:39;01:52:44;"Whereas he's like, defiantly, ""I'm done drinking for you,"
01:52:44;01:52:48;"but I'm not done drinking. Make of that what you will."""
01:52:48;01:52:51;"Am I deluding myself? Who knows?"
01:52:51;01:52:53;"He's really expanding on the genre."
01:52:53;01:52:58;"I feel like what he should do if he's not drinking for that person anymore"
01:52:58;01:53:01;"is just start drinking a different brand of whiskey."
01:53:01;01:53:04;"It would be a nice way to section it off."
01:53:04;01:53:09;"Like, ""Bartender, that's the brand that I do for my depressed drinking."""
01:53:09;01:53:10;"I don't want to drink anymore..."
01:53:10;01:53:11;"Maybe switch to tequila."
01:53:11;01:53:13;"No more Jack Daniels."
01:53:13;01:53:17;"Bring me some of that Florida Georgia Line whiskey."
01:53:17;01:53:20;"And that's when Florida Georgia Line come in with a cameo."
01:53:20;01:53:23;"Pour me that Old Camp. And that's the cue."
01:53:23;01:53:25;"Give me a glass of Old Camp."
01:53:25;01:53:27;"Then the whole vibe changes."
01:53:27;01:53:31;"The number one song this week in '91, ""Roxette."""
01:53:31;01:53:33;"I have to go, so let's blast these."
01:53:33;01:53:35;"Let's blast this. ""Roxette"" with Joyride."
01:53:35;01:53:36;"One minute."
01:53:36;01:53:37;"We got 60 seconds here."
01:53:37;01:53:39;"I don't think I know the song."
01:53:39;01:53:40;"Let's do it."
01:53:40;01:53:42;"""Roxette"" was a German band, right?"
01:53:42;01:53:43;"It did. It's a lot of hits."
01:53:43;01:53:44;"Yeah."
01:53:44;01:53:48;"It must have been love, but it's all over now."
01:53:48;01:53:50;"I love you."
01:53:50;01:53:52;"I'm going to join the Joyride."
01:53:52;01:53:54;"Oh, this is huge."
01:53:54;01:53:56;"This was big in Canada."
01:53:56;01:54:00;"This seems like a song that would be big in Canada, not the U.S."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"Oh, yeah. This was like on our..."
01:54:02;01:54:06;"This was top in our charts for sure when I was like nine."
01:54:06;01:54:09;"All right. Well, we got to go."
