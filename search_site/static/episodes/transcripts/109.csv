00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis back once again."
00:02;00:04;"It's Super Bowl Sunday."
00:04;00:06;"But we still have to talk about last Sunday."
00:06;00:10;"This is a major Sunday."
00:10;00:12;"Many Sundays at the same time."
00:12;00:14;"We'll be talking about the Grammys,"
00:14;00:16;"sports,"
00:16;00:18;"Snickers, Boston Accents,"
00:18;00:23;"all that, plus the greatest hits of 1967 and 1993."
00:23;00:28;"This is a very special Sunday of Sundays on..."
00:28;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:31;00:33;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beast."
00:33;00:35;"One."
00:42;00:49;"There was a felled wobbly leaf of my rightful chances."
00:49;00:56;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:56;01:04;"And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go."
01:04;01:08;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:08;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:15;01:19;"Leave the lonely man."
01:19;01:21;"Time Crisis back once again."
01:21;01:24;"Rolling in, hard commute over here to Culver City."
01:24;01:26;"Slamming pizza pre-show."
01:26;01:29;"Just crushing some slices."
01:29;01:30;"Do you still say ""za""?"
01:30;01:32;"Yeah. Is it kind of basic now?"
01:32;01:34;"That's a good question."
01:34;01:38;"Feel free to tweet @TimeCrisis2000, let us know how you feel."
01:38;01:40;"I feel like you've been saying ""za"" for a long time,"
01:40;01:43;"and the way that you always said it, you were just like a chilled out dude."
01:43;01:48;"Whereas like, I think there became something on the internet"
01:48;01:53;"about being really into pizza that became kind of lame."
01:53;01:54;"So when you say it, I'm still down."
01:54;01:57;"I think I'm like 20 years deep on saying ""za""."
01:57;02:00;"Listen man, whatever people are talking, memes people are sharing on Facebook,"
02:00;02:03;"I've been crushing ""za"" for 20 years, and I'm not going to stop."
02:03;02:04;"I'm old school."
02:04;02:08;"I remember saying it around my parents' house, like, ""Oh, let's get some za."""
02:08;02:11;"My dad just being like, ""What? What are you saying?"""
02:11;02:13;"You know, like, ""Pizza. Za."""
02:13;02:14;"So it just came to you?"
02:14;02:15;"Yeah."
02:15;02:17;"I remember thinking this is really pushing it with the abbreviations,"
02:17;02:19;"but I'm going to give it a spin."
02:19;02:20;"It makes a lot of sense."
02:20;02:21;"You know what it is?"
02:21;02:24;"I like the way that you deliver it, because when you say, like, ""Let's get some za,"""
02:24;02:26;"I was slamming some ""za."""
02:26;02:30;"You just sound like a hungry dude who doesn't have time to say the whole thing,"
02:30;02:35;"versus I feel like there's this type of fetishization of being into pizza."
02:35;02:38;"If somebody's just like, ""Is it za time?"""
02:38;02:39;"And it's like, ""Chill."""
02:39;02:40;"Calm down."
02:41;02:43;"Being really into pizza."
02:43;02:45;"Being really into anything."
02:45;02:49;"I was watching--I was, like, really stoned a few weeks ago at my house."
02:49;02:50;"Which I don't usually--"
02:50;02:51;"Yeah, I know."
02:51;02:53;"People probably assume that you're a huge stoner."
02:53;02:54;"I'm not."
02:54;02:55;"Yeah, just time to time."
02:55;03:00;"The guy that owns the gym that I go to gave me some pot brownies that he made."
03:00;03:01;"Whoa."
03:01;03:03;"And they were, like, fierce."
03:03;03:05;"And I went in on one one night."
03:05;03:08;"But then I started watching this David Chang cooking show."
03:08;03:09;"I think that's his name, right?"
03:09;03:10;"Oh, I've heard about this."
03:10;03:11;"Yeah, yeah."
03:11;03:14;"And, like, they're going around from, like, high-end pizzeria to high-end pizzeria."
03:14;03:15;"Yeah."
03:15;03:17;"Really parsing the differences between these restaurants."
03:17;03:18;"Yeah."
03:18;03:21;"But I was so baked, and I was like, ""Dudes, it's pizza."""
03:21;03:22;"Yeah."
03:22;03:23;"""It's all good."""
03:23;03:24;"Right."
03:24;03:25;"""Who cares?"""
03:25;03:28;"Like, ""Oh, there's, like, arugula on here."
03:28;03:29;"Who cares?"
03:29;03:30;"It's going to be good."""
03:30;03:31;"I know what you mean."
03:31;03:32;"I was, like, so tripped out."
03:32;03:35;"I find, at times, when I'm really baked--"
03:35;03:39;"On the one hand, being really baked, if you're, like, absorbing the right thing,"
03:39;03:42;"because you're a little bit in slow motion, you can be like,"
03:42;03:45;"""Whoa, there's this whole dimension of this that I never saw before."""
03:45;03:49;"On the other hand, when you're really baked, because you're in slow motion,"
03:49;03:51;"if something feels--"
03:51;03:53;"And, by the way, I ride for David Chang."
03:53;03:54;"Oh, yeah."
03:54;03:55;"Great restaurateur."
03:55;03:56;"I'm sure."
03:56;03:57;"I'm just covering my base."
03:57;03:58;"I've never had his food, but--"
03:58;03:59;"He's a good dude."
03:59;04:05;"But if I'm really baked and I'm in a situation that maybe has a lot of pretense--"
04:05;04:07;"[laughter]"
04:07;04:08;"--or formality--"
04:08;04:11;"The first time I remember having this feeling, actually, it was kind of different."
04:11;04:15;"I was just at a concert in Brooklyn when I used to live in Brooklyn,"
04:15;04:18;"and I just went to a show, and I just remember, like, seeing this band."
04:18;04:20;"You know, they were making some waves at the time,"
04:20;04:26;"and I just remember being in the audience and just being like, ""Yo, this sucks."""
04:26;04:28;"Like, in a way that I wouldn't have felt normally."
04:28;04:30;"And I was just, like, seeing it in slow motion."
04:30;04:36;"And I got a little high once at a semi-formal event where somebody was, like, speaking a lot."
04:36;04:38;"And I just remember, again, hearing this [bleep] in slow motion,"
04:38;04:44;"just being, like--a little bit out of character, just like, ""Dude, shut the [bleep] up, man."""
04:44;04:51;"I know. It's funny when weed makes it--puts you in, like, a negative headspace, but it's kind of fun."
04:51;04:56;"It's kind of fun, but you're just like--it does seem like the scales fall from your eyes."
04:56;04:58;"You're getting weed-pilled."
04:58;05:03;"You're literally getting weed-pilled, where you're just like, ""Dude, who cares?"""
05:03;05:09;"And I could totally picture that, like, watching a show, just like, ""Oh, my God, who gives a [bleep]?"""
05:09;05:11;"It only happens every now and then."
05:11;05:14;"We were, like, so serious about this pizza."
05:14;05:16;"Man, it's pizza."
05:16;05:18;"People probably think we're both big stoners."
05:18;05:20;"I've had, like, stoner moments in life."
05:20;05:28;"I wouldn't say it's an everyday thing, but just a couple of being a little too stoned stories come to mind."
05:28;05:31;"That also involved, like, the way you interpret something."
05:31;05:33;"This was, like, only half negative."
05:33;05:34;"I wonder if I've told this story."
05:34;05:37;"And also, by the way, sometimes when you're in a situation that's pretense"
05:37;05:39;"and you feel like you're super high and you're seeing through it,"
05:39;05:42;"it doesn't mean you're right, necessarily."
05:42;05:44;"You were in a special state of mind."
05:44;05:49;"I remember this time in college that a bunch of us were kind of stoned."
05:49;05:51;"And I was, like, more stoned than I thought."
05:51;05:52;"We'd, like, walk out onto the streets."
05:52;05:56;"We went down to Coronet's Pizza, which is the go-to pizza by Columbia."
05:56;05:57;"They do a big slice."
05:57;06:04;"The guy in front of us, there was a kind of, you know, collegiate guy."
06:04;06:07;"And I was, like, watching him, just, like, watching the back of his head, him talking to his friend."
06:07;06:10;"And I'm just, like, already in my head just being, like, ""Oh, my God, man."
06:10;06:12;"Shut the f--- up."""
06:12;06:15;"You know, I'm, like, a mellow guy, but I was in that slightly negative head space"
06:15;06:17;"where I'm just, like, listening to these guys have a conversation."
06:17;06:20;"I'm just thinking, like, ""Oh, my God. What the f---?"""
06:20;06:24;"And then anyway, so then they get to the front of the line."
06:24;06:25;"They each order their slice."
06:25;06:29;"And then the guy that I've been looking at goes, ""Can I get a large orange soda?"""
06:29;06:30;"And I died."
06:30;06:31;"You just--"
06:31;06:33;"Oh, my God."
06:33;06:34;"Just picture that."
06:34;06:36;"You're in that negative head space, and the dude gets an orange soda."
06:36;06:38;"Orange, bro."
06:38;06:41;"I think if I wasn't high, I almost might have given him a tip of the hat."
06:41;06:43;"Like, interesting choice."
06:43;06:44;"Solid choice."
06:44;06:49;"But at the time, I was probably thinking, like, ""Bro, you're 19, drinking orange?"
06:49;06:51;"Oh, my God."""
06:51;06:55;"And I'm not even anti-orange soda, but the idea of this dude just, like, eating this huge slice of pizza"
06:55;07:00;"with, like, a big orange soda, I was just, like, in my weird high and negative logic"
07:00;07:03;"of already, like, being like, ""This guy just won't shut up, man."""
07:03;07:06;"I get real quiet, so I'm like, ""This guy won't f---ing shut up."""
07:06;07:07;"And then he gets an orange soda."
07:07;07:08;"It was just, like, so on brand."
07:08;07:14;"It was, like, the perfect punchline in that bizarre logic, and I was just, like, dying."
07:14;07:16;"It's also funny the--"
07:16;07:19;"And this is more of a public service announcement."
07:19;07:21;"You know, you really got to be careful with edibles."
07:21;07:22;"It's no joke."
07:22;07:27;"I once was solo at home, and I felt like getting a little high."
07:27;07:30;"I looked around, and all I could find was, like, some big cookie."
07:30;07:34;"And it was one of those ones, you know, California-style legal weed cookie,"
07:34;07:35;"probably given as a gift."
07:35;07:37;"Nobody in our household is, like, buying that."
07:37;07:42;"So this was a big weed cookie, and I looked at the whole thing, and the whole thing was, like, 100 milligrams,"
07:42;07:46;"which is a lot, unless you're, like, a super, super stoner."
07:46;07:48;"I think, like, 5 to 10 is plenty."
07:48;07:49;"Wow."
07:49;07:51;"But I look at 100, so I'm like, ""All right, 100."
07:51;07:53;"I'm going to eat a very small bite of this."""
07:53;07:55;"But then you got your hot spots."
07:55;07:56;"You know, if it's not--"
07:56;07:57;"Oh, is that a thing?"
07:57;08:00;"I had this conversation once with, like, a real weed-type person."
08:00;08:03;"They were like, ""Got to watch out for the hot spots, man,"" because, you know--"
08:03;08:05;"It's not a uniform density."
08:05;08:10;"So, you know, I eyeballed it, and I was like, ""What do I think would be at, like, less than a tenth of this cookie?"""
08:10;08:11;"And I ate it."
08:11;08:15;"It must have all been in one chocolate chip or something because I was just so baked,"
08:15;08:16;"and I felt it coming on."
08:16;08:18;"I was like, ""Holy s---,"" and I was, like, alone at home."
08:18;08:21;"And it was the first time I ever watched ""Hypernormalization."""
08:21;08:22;"Oh, dude."
08:22;08:23;"Adam Curtis."
08:23;08:25;"So--and that was--I was, like, freaked out, but I kind of enjoyed it"
08:25;08:29;"because that's--instead of that ""shut the f--- up"" vibe, it was more just like--"
08:29;08:30;"Whoa!"
08:30;08:32;"That is a perfect doc to watch in that state."
08:32;08:36;"By the way, any TC head should watch ""Hypernormalization"" by Adam Curtis."
08:36;08:37;"Oh, yeah."
08:37;08:39;"We haven't done that joke in a while, but when we used to go--"
08:39;08:40;"It's a real touchstone."
08:40;08:41;"This is a fantasy."
08:41;08:43;"We're kind of doing an impersonation of Adam Curtis."
08:43;08:45;"He's a documentarian."
08:45;08:48;"""Hypernormalization,"" not everybody agrees with his theses."
08:48;08:50;"Very talented man, though."
08:50;08:51;"Definitely."
08:51;08:52;"It gets you thinking."
08:52;08:56;"There's that part where they're talking about in the years leading up to 9/11,"
08:56;09:01;"disaster movies were very popular, and so they have this whole sequence of visions"
09:01;09:04;"of, like, you know, Independence Day, the White House getting destroyed,"
09:04;09:07;"all these movies from, like, the late '90s, early 2000s"
09:07;09:10;"that just show stuff being destroyed."
09:10;09:16;"And the song behind it is the suicide song ""Dream Baby Dream."""
09:16;09:17;"You know, Bruce did a good cover of this."
09:17;09:18;"Yeah, sure, sure."
09:18;09:19;"Classic."
09:19;09:23;"So this is from--I just picture being, like, super high and, like, this coming in."
09:23;09:26;"This is also the type of song that's, like--it's almost like feels like a massage"
09:26;09:29;"when you're high and just, like, watching all this [bleep] blow up."
09:29;09:35;"The sequence felt like it was two hours, and I just, like, by myself, like, mouth open."
09:35;09:37;"Holy [bleep]"
09:52;09:54;"Thought about getting big for the Grammys. Didn't do it."
09:54;10:00;"That would have been a true, like, ""Dude, shut the f up"" moment."
10:00;10:02;"Drank a little tequila at the Grammys."
10:02;10:04;"Nice, dude. Pre or post?"
10:04;10:09;"It was during the televised part. Some of our compatriots somehow, like, bounced for a while"
10:09;10:11;"and were, like, up in somebody's box."
10:11;10:13;"Because, you know, it's just like any event at the Stable Center."
10:13;10:15;"There's corporate boxes."
10:15;10:19;"Somebody ended up there, and they were just like, ""Oh, yo, brought down some, like,"
10:19;10:23;"real high school style, just, like, a Poland Spring bottle with some tequila in it."""
10:23;10:26;"And we're like, ""All right."" Took it back to our seats, just like--"
10:26;10:29;"So there's no alcohol allowed on, like, the general floor?"
10:29;10:31;"I don't even know what's going on."
10:31;10:36;"It's like, once the show starts, you can't, like, get nachos or chicken tenders anymore."
10:36;10:38;"Are those available pre-show?"
10:38;10:41;"I think they're-- it was slightly available."
10:41;10:42;"At some point in the middle of the show--"
10:42;10:43;"That's hilarious."
10:43;10:48;"I walked back up to, like, the area that encircles the actual arena where there's vendors and stuff."
10:48;10:50;"And the only thing you could buy was water."
10:50;10:55;"Well, people were probably in, like, their fancy clothes, and they didn't want to be eating, like, nachos and hot dogs."
10:55;10:58;"Maybe. But people get hungry because it takes so long."
10:58;11:01;"How long is the ceremony? How long were you there?"
11:01;11:03;"Well, we might as well go through the whole day."
11:03;11:05;"First of all, congratulations."
11:05;11:06;"Oh, thank you."
11:06;11:09;"Let's just do a little Grammy blow-by-blow here."
11:09;11:11;"[applause]"
11:11;11:13;"[laughter]"
11:13;11:18;"All right, it's time for-- and we kind of-- actually, Seinfeld, on the Twitter, he already kind of billed this as, like,"
11:18;11:20;"""This is going to be our big Grammy episode."""
11:20;11:21;"Right, right."
11:21;11:25;"I don't know if we have time to make it the whole Grammy episode, maybe get in a little Super Bowl later."
11:25;11:26;"This is a big weekend."
11:26;11:27;"Huge."
11:27;11:29;"I was just in Iowa with Bernie Sanders."
11:29;11:31;"I regret I was not there."
11:31;11:34;"I mean, there's so much to talk about, but yeah, let's start with the Grammys."
11:34;11:41;"""Father of the Bride"" wins second-- your second consecutive Grammy for best alternative album? Is that--"
11:41;11:44;"We were looking it up. These are the artists who have won three."
11:44;11:47;"That category is interesting. I've seen this before."
11:47;11:51;"Who was the last artist to win two-- win consecutive Grammys?"
11:51;11:55;"So there's three artists who have won three, and there's two artists who have won two."
11:55;11:57;"For alternative album we're talking about?"
11:57;12:02;"Yeah. Which artists do you think have won-- and keep in mind, that category started in, like, 1990."
12:02;12:03;"Radiohead?"
12:03;12:04;"Yes, that's one of them."
12:04;12:08;"So they won, like, OK Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac?"
12:08;12:10;"I'm going to look it up to know for sure."
12:10;12:11;"Radiohead won that for--"
12:11;12:13;"That's not consecutive."
12:13;12:15;"No, not consecutive, but just period."
12:15;12:16;"They won for OK Computer--"
12:16;12:18;"In Rainbows, and Kid A."
12:18;12:20;"So they won consecutively with OK--"
12:20;12:22;"Three albums in a row."
12:22;12:23;"OK Computer and Kid A."
12:23;12:24;"Oh, yeah, not Amnesiac."
12:24;12:27;"Right. So they've won three total, but two consecutive."
12:27;12:29;"What other artists do you think have won three?"
12:29;12:31;"Um, Beck?"
12:31;12:33;"Yeah. Look at you, Jake."
12:33;12:34;"Pulled that out."
12:34;12:44;"Beck won three for Odelay in '97, then Mutations in 2000, and then he won for Colors last year."
12:44;12:46;"And there's one other artist who ever won three."
12:46;12:47;"Got our two for two here."
12:47;12:49;"Yeah, this one's a little harder."
12:49;12:50;"What era?"
12:50;12:52;"They really came to prominence in the early 2000s."
12:52;12:54;"Arcade Fire? No."
12:54;12:55;"That's a good guess, but no."
12:55;12:56;"Strokes?"
12:56;12:59;"I think you should have thought about that one more, Jake."
12:59;13:02;"Not to be hard on, but I'm just saying--"
13:02;13:05;"What, they dropped off so hard for the first record? Is that what you mean?"
13:05;13:09;"Well, I don't think they did at all, but that was-- the haters tried to say that."
13:09;13:12;"Although, shout out to the Strokes. They're doing a show for Bernie, too."
13:12;13:13;"I saw that."
13:13;13:14;"Up in New Hampshire."
13:14;13:15;"I like the second record."
13:15;13:16;"Second record's great."
13:16;13:17;"Yeah."
13:17;13:21;"Third record's solid, and then fourth through however many, all have tunes."
13:21;13:25;"But there's another artist that came out around the same time as the Strokes--"
13:25;13:26;"Wilco?"
13:26;13:29;"That had-- also a decent guess, but also Wilco came out earlier."
13:29;13:32;"But there's another artist that came out around the same time as the Strokes"
13:32;13:36;"who had more-- probably equal impact,"
13:36;13:41;"but had more albums that kind of just like people rallied behind as albums."
13:41;13:45;"The Strokes always got a harder time just 'cause the first album's just like so out of this world."
13:45;13:46;"Right."
13:46;13:48;"Almost came out at the exact same time."
13:48;13:49;"Another New York band?"
13:49;13:52;"No. They're from another part of the country, and there's actually--"
13:52;13:54;"[laughter]"
13:54;13:56;"They did a kind of legendary--"
13:56;13:57;"It's a great segment."
13:57;14:01;"They did a legendary set of concerts where when these guys came to New York,"
14:01;14:05;"they opened for the Strokes, and then they took the Strokes back to their city of origin,"
14:05;14:06;"and the Strokes opened for them."
14:06;14:07;"I'm really--"
14:07;14:10;"I'm going to name the albums that they won for."
14:10;14:11;"Okay."
14:11;14:16;"2004, they won their first Best Alternative Grammy for ""Elephant."""
14:16;14:18;"Okay, I'm drawing a blank here."
14:18;14:23;"In 2006, they scored another with ""Get Behind Me, Satan."""
14:23;14:24;"Wow."
14:24;14:25;"And then in 2008--"
14:25;14:27;"This is not a band that I'm very familiar with."
14:27;14:33;"In 2008, they got their third and final Best Alternative Grammy with ""Icky Thump."""
14:33;14:34;"This is amazing."
14:34;14:35;"[laughter]"
14:35;14:36;"I've never heard of any of those albums."
14:36;14:37;"Really?"
14:37;14:38;"No."
14:38;14:39;"""Icky Thump."""
14:39;14:40;"[laughter]"
14:40;14:41;"Yeah."
14:41;14:43;"Wait, can you just play one of their songs, play their top song?"
14:43;14:44;"Yeah, yeah, sure."
14:44;14:45;"And I'll just see if I recognize it."
14:45;14:46;"Yeah."
14:46;14:47;"You will."
14:47;14:48;"[laughter]"
14:48;14:51;"Because their top song is just so massive."
14:51;14:52;"Remember I said they have--"
14:52;14:53;"It's not ""Arcade Fire."""
14:53;14:54;"It's not."
14:54;14:57;"They have one song that is like truly--"
14:57;14:58;"It's probably the biggest--"
14:58;14:59;"Oh, ""White Stripes."""
14:59;15:00;"Yes."
15:00;15:03;"[singing]"
15:03;15:06;"You could probably make the case that this is the biggest rock song--"
15:06;15:07;"I think we touched on this one."
15:07;15:08;"--of the past 20 years."
15:10;15:16;"Yeah, there's no Stroke songs that are played during timeouts at like basketball games."
15:16;15:17;"Last night!"
15:17;15:18;"[laughter]"
15:18;15:20;"I could do that at like a Knicks game or something."
15:20;15:21;"Yeah."
15:22;15:24;"They're gonna rip it off."
15:24;15:29;"Taking their time right behind my back."
15:29;15:35;"And I'm talking to myself at night because I can't forget."
15:35;15:43;"Back and forth through my mind behind a cigarette."
15:43;15:51;"And a message coming from my eyes says leave it alone."
15:51;15:53;"Were you ever a White Stripes guy?"
15:53;15:55;"No, I never got the appeal."
15:55;15:58;"Even that song, I'm just sort of like, it's so basic."
15:58;16:00;"It's not like a cool melody."
16:00;16:01;"It doesn't really rock."
16:01;16:02;"I don't know."
16:02;16:03;"It doesn't rock?"
16:03;16:04;"I mean, it kind of does."
16:04;16:05;"It just was like--"
16:05;16:07;"OK, but I do have to say that--"
16:07;16:08;"I don't know."
16:08;16:12;"--that saying it's not a very good melody is a little bit funny when it's literally"
16:12;16:17;"the only melody that rock music has produced in 20 years that everybody in the world knows."
16:17;16:18;"That is true."
16:18;16:19;"Not for Jake, though."
16:19;16:20;"Not everybody."
16:20;16:23;"[singing]"
16:23;16:25;"You could be at like a soccer game literally anywhere in the world."
16:25;16:26;"Yeah."
16:26;16:28;"If you go, bah, da-da-da-da-da-da."
16:28;16:30;"Well, we don't have to dwell on this."
16:30;16:33;"But yeah, those are the three artists who have three."
16:33;16:35;"Beck, Radiohead, and the White Stripes."
16:35;16:37;"And then there's two artists that have two."
16:37;16:38;"We're still going with this."
16:38;16:41;"Yeah, can you name the two artists that have two?"
16:41;16:43;"Well, one is Vampire Weekend."
16:43;16:44;"There you go."
16:44;16:45;"One is Vampire Weekend."
16:45;16:49;"The other one is a band that probably their albums wouldn't-- and we should talk about"
16:49;16:52;"this, the whole Grammy controversy and the voting and all that."
16:52;16:53;"But today--"
16:53;16:54;"What era?"
16:54;16:56;"They won their two in the early 2000s as well."
16:56;16:57;"Years back to back."
16:57;17:00;"They won one in 2002, one in 2003."
17:00;17:05;"And this band, today, I bet if the committee that decides who's eligible-- because that's"
17:05;17:09;"the whole thing with the Grammys, is that a committee decides-- it literally sits around"
17:09;17:11;"and says, ""Well, is this alternative?"""
17:11;17:12;"Right."
17:12;17:15;"And today, if they put out a record, I bet a lot of people would be like, ""No, they're"
17:15;17:16;"no longer alternative."""
17:16;17:17;"They're too big."
17:18;17:19;"They crossed over into pop."
17:19;17:20;"And they're still going."
17:20;17:21;"They're still going."
17:21;17:22;"Foo Fighter?"
17:22;17:23;"No."
17:23;17:24;"No?"
17:24;17:25;"Foo Fighter is like '90s."
17:25;17:27;"Is it like that kind of band?"
17:27;17:28;"Or like Fountains of Wee?"
17:28;17:32;"I don't-- there's all these bands, like, who are kind of heavy that I don't--"
17:32;17:33;"No, they're not heavy."
17:33;17:34;"They're not heavy."
17:34;17:35;"They were never really heavy."
17:35;17:41;"It's just that they became so big and became a real force in the pop world in their career."
17:41;17:42;"They're English."
17:42;17:43;"2002, 2003, the Grammys--"
17:43;17:49;"What's an English band that in the early 2000s just rose to prominence and went on to become"
17:49;17:51;"perhaps the biggest band in the world?"
17:51;17:52;"Oh, Coldplay."
17:52;17:53;"Coldplay."
17:53;17:54;"Yeah, that's right."
17:54;17:55;"Right."
17:55;17:56;"Okay."
17:56;17:57;"One thing I'll say about best alternative album, and then we should probably talk about the"
17:57;18:01;"controversy of the Grammys, is that given that it's the only category that we've ever won"
18:01;18:07;"in, I do feel like when you look through it, I'm just like, look, there's records I love"
18:07;18:08;"that won it."
18:08;18:10;"There's records I think are just okay that won it."
18:10;18:13;"But when I look through everything that's ever been nominated, at least there's like"
18:13;18:18;"rhyme and reason to it, which is not true of all things in the Grammys, which is why"
18:18;18:20;"a lot of people have a problem with them."
18:20;18:23;"But like, even just going back, the first one, '91, Sinead O'Connor."
18:23;18:24;"'92, R.E.M."
18:24;18:25;"At a Time."
18:25;18:27;"'93, Tom Waits, Bone Machine."
18:27;18:28;"'94, U2."
18:28;18:29;"'95, Green Day."
18:29;18:30;"'96, Nirvana."
18:30;18:31;"MTV Unplugged."
18:31;18:35;"And then you get into this era where it's almost every year it's Beck Radiohead, Beastie"
18:35;18:39;"Boys, Beck Radiohead, Coldplay, Coldplay, White Stripes, Wilco."
18:39;18:42;"You know, whatever you want to say about the individual records."
18:42;18:43;"Phoenix, well deserved."
18:43;18:45;"They won that for Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix."
18:45;18:46;"Terrific record."
18:46;18:47;"Great record."
18:47;18:48;"Boney Vare."
18:48;18:53;"Anyway, I'm just saying, I look through it, St. Vincent, Alabama Shakes, David Bowie,"
18:53;18:54;"The National, Beck."
18:54;18:57;"I'm just like, all right, those are all artists that I respect."
18:57;19:00;"There's nobody on that list that I'm just like, oof."
19:00;19:04;"Like, we're winning the same award that was a mere three years ago given to, and just"
19:04;19:07;"like name some (beep) you can't even understand."
19:07;19:08;"It's not like that."
19:08;19:10;"But it was a funny year at the Grammys."
19:10;19:13;"I mean, first of all, it was a pleasant morning."
19:13;19:15;"You know, we had a fun crew going to the Grammys."
19:15;19:21;"Me and Rashida, Ariel and Danielle, Chris and Chris, Dave Maklovich."
19:21;19:22;"It looked fun on the 'Gram."
19:22;19:24;"So it was like a good crew of people."
19:24;19:29;"In the morning, we were all like kind of getting ready together, drinking coffee, blasting"
19:29;19:30;"some tunes."
19:30;19:31;"What were you blasting?"
19:31;19:36;"At first, somebody was just playing like a very random playlist that was like pop and"
19:36;19:37;"trap music."
19:37;19:41;"And then at some point I threw on Dick Pick's Volume One."
19:41;19:42;"Nice."
19:42;19:47;"I was getting ready to listen to Stephen Hyden's new podcast, which we talked about on this,"
19:47;19:49;"which is called 36 From the Vault, I believe."
19:49;19:51;"Yep, I listened to episode two today."
19:51;19:52;"Oh, really?"
19:52;19:53;"Big fan of that show."
19:53;19:55;"Yeah, everybody should check that out."
19:55;19:57;"But you know, they go each episode is a different Dick Pick."
19:57;19:59;"So I didn't like kind of listen to like half of it."
19:59;20:02;"And then I was like, you know what, I want to like just listen to the whole thing."
20:02;20:03;"So we throw that on."
20:03;20:05;"Opens with a great Here Comes Sunshine."
20:05;20:06;"Great vibe."
20:06;20:07;"So we're all hanging out."
20:07;20:09;"Everybody's having a good time."
20:09;20:13;"You know, it's like we all know each other, but it's not every day that obviously me,"
20:13;20:17;"Chris and Chris spend a lot of time together and not every day that we get Dave and everybody"
20:17;20:18;"together."
20:18;20:19;"So we're having a ball."
20:19;20:21;"But then you get the Kobe news."
20:21;20:22;"Right."
20:22;20:24;"And it's like so sad, so disturbing."
20:24;20:25;"Yeah."
20:25;20:26;"So right."
20:26;20:27;"You're just kind of like, man."
20:27;20:30;"And you know, like we were kind of looking out a window at a dress."
20:30;20:33;"Somebody's like, oh, can you normally like see is there like a view here normally?"
20:33;20:35;"And I was like, you know, you can kind of see stuff."
20:35;20:37;"And we just looked at this before we heard."
20:37;20:38;"We just like."
20:38;20:40;"But today it's like this weird, just like white."
20:40;20:41;"Yeah."
20:41;20:43;"Full white, white out sky."
20:43;20:44;"So there's like, oh, my God."
20:44;20:46;"Then you're picturing the whole thing."
20:46;20:47;"So anyway."
20:47;20:50;"And then then you did don's on everybody like already just talking about how sad that is."
20:50;20:52;"And you're just hearing about all these people died."
20:52;20:53;"And it's just a it's a tragedy."
20:53;20:56;"Then you're like, oh, man, you're going to Staples Center."
20:56;20:58;"And anyway, so that kind of already created a weird vibe."
20:58;21:03;"And then even before that, the week before, did you follow any of this controversy?"
21:03;21:09;"The Grammys or the Recording Academy had dismissed the the new head of the organization."
21:09;21:11;"Her name is Deborah Dugan."
21:11;21:13;"So I've read about it a bit."
21:13;21:17;"I've mostly had it explained to me by music industry professionals."
21:17;21:23;"Basically, the Grammys used to be run by a guy named Neil Portnow, and he was doing it for a long time."
21:23;21:29;"He was the guy who there always be a part in the night where he'd come out and say a few words about the mission statement of the Academy."
21:29;21:33;"And they do a lot of good stuff, from what I understand, give money for music education."
21:33;21:39;"And there's this organization, Music Cares, that helps out musicians who don't have health insurance, which I think the Academy is part of."
21:39;21:40;"It's a big organization."
21:40;21:41;"It's a little hard to wrap your head around."
21:41;21:47;"But he'd been there a long time, and I think he made a sexist statement."
21:47;21:51;"Something like people asked him a question like, ""How come more women aren't nominated?"""
21:51;21:53;"And he made kind of like a glib..."
21:53;21:55;"He had kind of like..."
21:55;21:57;"Very creaky mic stand here."
21:57;22:02;"So he had like a somewhat glib response where he said something like, ""Well, the ladies got to step it up."""
22:02;22:03;"That didn't land."
22:03;22:04;"It didn't land at all."
22:04;22:08;"So next thing you know, he's out finally bringing in a woman to be head of it."
22:08;22:14;"And then a couple weeks before the Grammys, the Grammys are like, ""She's out. She abused staff members."""
22:14;22:15;"And you're like, ""Whoa."""
22:15;22:16;"Damn."
22:16;22:17;"And they're not specific."
22:17;22:21;"And then she comes back and says, ""I didn't do anything. I was about to blow the lid off this whole thing."""
22:21;22:29;"And she has a long lawsuit that's public that I clicked through where she's saying she was sexually harassed by their lawyer,"
22:29;22:32;"the guy who is like the head lawyer for the Grammys."
22:32;22:39;"So she personally experienced that and then she's talking about allegations against other people, other big dogs in the organization."
22:39;22:40;"That's one thing."
22:40;22:42;"You have your kind of like sexual misconduct side of it."
22:42;22:45;"But then she also says stuff about like..."
22:45;22:48;"And also they're cooking the books on who wins."
22:48;22:49;"Whoa."
22:49;22:54;"And she alleges that there are times when people are pushed to the front of the line in the nominations."
22:54;23:01;"I don't think she alleged that the vote is ever like fully discarded, which is kind of what I believe."
23:01;23:07;"That was always my understanding is that because they have these committees and there's the whole TV element of it,"
23:07;23:12;"that there are strings pulled in terms of disqualifying something."
23:12;23:16;"Or maybe like somebody sits on a committee that decides what counts for best dance music,"
23:16;23:20;"but they earn A&R for a label that has skin in the game."
23:20;23:22;"I think there's a lot of stuff like that."
23:22;23:25;"But there's always a part of me that's kind of like, ""Yeah, that's lame."""
23:25;23:29;"But I guess as long as once the nominations are in, the votes count,"
23:29;23:33;"maybe that's the best you could hope for, for like a big giant award ceremony."
23:33;23:39;"And she also alleged that one of the primary ways that things get messy for the big categories,"
23:39;23:43;"that maybe there have been times strings were pulled to ensure that real A-list artists"
23:43;23:45;"who maybe they'd want to perform at the ceremony."
23:45;23:50;"Because keep in mind, you have your Grammys, all the awards, but then you have the TV show."
23:50;23:52;"And the TV show, folks, big business."
23:52;23:53;"Huge."
23:54;23:59;"CBS paid something like $700 million for the 10-year rights."
23:59;24:00;"Oh, the 10-year rights. Okay."
24:00;24:01;"Yeah, not per."
24:01;24:05;"But still, they're dropping 70 mil every year."
24:05;24:06;"There's a lot of money out there."
24:06;24:11;"So she kind of alleged that there are times where they want a big name performing,"
24:11;24:15;"but maybe that big name isn't going to say yes unless they're nominated,"
24:15;24:16;"and then they make sure they're not."
24:16;24:17;"Okay."
24:17;24:18;"So I think there's a lot of stuff like that."
24:18;24:23;"And I talked to various people who seem knowledgeable,"
24:23;24:25;"and I'm just like, ""Man, can you count any of this stuff?"""
24:25;24:26;"This is what the people said to me."
24:26;24:28;"I don't know if they're just trying to put my mind at ease."
24:28;24:34;"They're just like, ""Trust us. This is the type of s*** that probably made you guys get less nominated rather than more."""
24:34;24:35;"But who knows?"
24:35;24:37;"I'm kind of like, ""Show us the books."""
24:37;24:39;"I'm also just like a numbers guy."
24:39;24:40;"So I'd love to--"
24:40;24:45;"I feel like I said this back in the day where we would talk about the idea that those years when you and I didn't vote,"
24:45;24:47;"maybe somebody lost by one vote."
24:47;24:49;"We're just like, ""Show us the numbers, man."""
24:49;24:54;"It would be so sick if there's like, ""And the best new artist by a margin of seven votes,"""
24:54;24:55;"and everyone's like, ""Oh!"""
24:55;24:56;"Right."
24:56;24:57;"Billie Eilish."
24:57;24:58;"But see, we don't know."
24:58;25:02;"So it's not like a political election, which I'm sure is very compromised too,"
25:02;25:04;"where we really know."
25:04;25:08;"White shirt now red, my bloody nose"
25:08;25:10;"Sleeping, yeah, on you"
25:10;25:15;"Tippy toes creeping around like no one knows"
25:15;25:18;"Think you're so criminal"
25:18;25:21;"Bruises on both my knees"
25:21;25:24;"For you, don't say thank you"
25:24;25:27;"Oh, please, I do what I want"
25:27;25:29;"When I'm wanting to"
25:29;25:32;"My soul so cynical"
25:32;25:35;"So you're a tough guy, like you're really rough guy"
25:35;25:39;"Just can't get enough guy, chest always so puffed guy"
25:39;25:42;"I'm that bad type, make your mama sad type"
25:42;25:46;"Make your girlfriend mad tight, might seduce your dad type"
25:46;25:49;"I'm the bad guy"
25:49;25:51;"Duh."
25:51;25:53;"But anyway, so all this was hanging over the Grammys, like going in."
25:53;25:59;"It's so similar to what you hear about major political parties."
25:59;26:02;"All like the weird handshakes in the back room and just sort of like,"
26:02;26:05;"it's funny to think about someone representing Vampire Weekend,"
26:05;26:07;"like really throwing their weight around in the back rooms."
26:07;26:09;"Well, I've heard stories about like,"
26:09;26:10;"You guys like hire some fixer."
26:10;26:11;"Yeah."
26:11;26:15;"You guys have like a Michael Cohen, working for Vampire."
26:15;26:18;"Well, the first thing that I thought of actually is like,"
26:18;26:21;"I do think in the best alternative category,"
26:21;26:23;"that's the place where more likely than not,"
26:23;26:25;"somebody would have tried to disqualify us."
26:25;26:28;"Because I have heard stories, not about us, but about"
26:28;26:30;"we make sense in best alternative."
26:30;26:31;"You know, it's a matter of taste."
26:31;26:35;"If you liked our record better than, you know, Justin's, but yeah,"
26:35;26:36;"we belong there."
26:36;26:39;"But the most likely thing that happens is people knocking each other out."
26:39;26:42;"So I've heard stories about like somebody telling me like,"
26:42;26:45;"Oh, that year, this like beloved indie band,"
26:45;26:46;"there was just somebody like,"
26:46;26:50;"just some kind of like intractable person on the committee who was just like,"
26:50;26:51;"they're too big."
26:51;26:52;"They're mainstream rock."
26:52;26:54;"And everybody like being like, come on."
26:54;26:56;"And like somebody just putting their foot down."
26:56;26:58;"So that kind of stuff happens."
26:58;27:01;"I guess that could happen like when you're..."
27:01;27:07;"But I would refer you to 1993, U2 won best alternative record for Octoon Baby."
27:07;27:10;"It's kind of like constitutional scholars just being like,"
27:10;27:15;"So you mean to tell me, sir, that the Black Keys, I don't know, like..."
27:15;27:18;"REM in '91, when they won for Out of Time."
27:18;27:20;"They're the biggest band in the world."
27:20;27:23;"They were the second biggest grossing band touring wise that year."
27:23;27:26;"You're going to tell me that that's alternative?"
27:26;27:29;"Well, we talked about last time, the alternative nominees,"
27:29;27:31;"again, whatever your taste may be,"
27:31;27:36;"it's a fairly wide, generous, somewhat generous interpretation of what alternative is."
27:36;27:40;"When we talked about best rock song, which Harmony Hall was nominated for,"
27:40;27:41;"that was all over the place."
27:41;27:45;"That was us, Gary Clark Jr. who won 1975, Tool."
27:45;27:46;"Hell yeah."
27:46;27:49;"And Tool did win an award when we were in the building."
27:49;27:50;"That was tight."
27:50;27:51;"For what?"
27:51;27:52;"I don't know."
27:52;27:53;"Packaging or something?"
27:53;27:54;"I really don't remember."
27:54;27:57;"Best metal performance or something?"
27:57;27:58;"Oh, I think you're right."
27:58;27:59;"I think I saw that."
27:59;28:02;"So even then, it's like, well, so you can be metal and rock?"
28:02;28:06;"Not all rock is metal, but all metal is rock."
28:06;28:08;"I can only picture what people might have said about Vampire Weekend."
28:08;28:10;"Just picture what we talked about last time."
28:10;28:14;"Just picture in the committee meeting when they're debating if Harmony Hall is a rock song."
28:14;28:17;"It was probably like, f*** Instagram comments."
28:17;28:18;"You know what?"
28:18;28:24;"Grammys, as a two-time Grammy award winner, I call on you for more transparency, for one."
28:24;28:25;"Just show us the numbers."
28:25;28:26;"I love the numbers."
28:26;28:27;"We all love the numbers."
28:27;28:34;"And also, please release the footage, if you filmed it, of the debate, the committee debate"
28:34;28:35;"during the best rock song."
28:35;28:39;"I just want to see somebody being like, ""You're really trying to put Vampire Weekend in the"
28:39;28:40;"same category as Tool?"
28:40;28:42;"I guess rock really is played out, dawg."""
28:42;28:46;"It'd be like that kind of meme of Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson fighting in a marriage"
28:46;28:49;"story, ""Rock's played out because of you!"""
28:49;28:52;"That's why rock's played out, dawg!"
28:52;28:54;"If you put Vampire Weekend next to Tool, then rock's played out."
28:54;28:58;"If we don't put them next to it, then rock's really played out!"
28:58;29:02;"One thing I'll say about the whole day, the whole strange day, is that, look, I think"
29:02;29:06;"I said on the show, I thought we had a decent shot in the rock song in alternative."
29:06;29:09;"And again, I've never taken the Grammys too seriously, because there's a part of me that's"
29:09;29:12;"like, look, we've won some, we've lost some."
29:12;29:17;"It's a nice pat on the back to know that some slight majority of people voted for you within"
29:17;29:18;"a community of musicians."
29:18;29:22;"I think they could do a better job of getting more people voting."
29:22;29:24;"Jake, you still haven't voted, right?"
29:24;29:25;"Yeah."
29:25;29:28;"This is a dark stain on this show at this point."
29:28;29:33;"The hardcore TC heads will remember when Jake and I first talked about the Grammys, because"
29:33;29:37;"I pointed out, my understanding is that almost any musician can vote in the Grammys."
29:37;29:41;"If you've played on a few records that have been officially released?"
29:41;29:44;"Four or five officially released credits."
29:44;29:50;"So, I've always had this feeling too, that to me, we need to like investigate some of"
29:50;29:52;"Debra Dugan's allegations."
29:52;29:58;"But generally speaking, they easily could be the most ethical awards show."
29:58;29:59;"Most democratic."
29:59;30:00;"Because they could be the most democratic."
30:00;30:01;"Right."
30:01;30:05;"Because even at the Oscars, they made a big push after some of the outcry the past few"
30:05;30:08;"years to invite new people to vote."
30:08;30:09;"So you don't have to have won an award."
30:09;30:11;"But even then, that's rarefied air though."
30:11;30:12;"That's still rarefied air."
30:12;30:17;"That's them turning around and being like, ""Well, why don't we let this young actor vote?"""
30:17;30:23;"Instead of the Academy, which at least in terms of their rules, there could be, you"
30:23;30:25;"know, like, who did Jake vote for?"
30:25;30:26;"Like, Jake should be voting."
30:26;30:28;"Playboy Cardi should be voting."
30:28;30:30;"Yeah, I mean, like half of our friends could probably vote."
30:30;30:33;"Almost everybody we know from music could be voting."
30:33;30:34;"And yet very few do."
30:34;30:35;"Let's get registered."
30:35;30:36;"Yeah, get registered."
30:36;30:39;"Voter registration drive next to Emmy's."
30:39;30:43;"But anyway, going in, I had a realization a couple of days before, because we were nominated"
30:43;30:45;"for our two Pre-Tell awards."
30:45;30:47;"Cool term, Pre-Tell."
30:47;30:49;"Look, we're Pre-Tell people, man."
30:49;30:50;"Go on without us."
30:50;30:51;"We're Pre-Tell."
30:51;30:52;"You're Tell."
30:52;30:53;"Best rock song is Pre-Tell?"
30:53;30:54;"Yeah."
30:54;30:55;"I guess rock really is played out."
30:55;30:56;"Rock's really played out."
30:56;30:57;"Well, first of all."
30:57;30:58;"That is disappointing."
30:58;31:00;"You know, it's just pure economics, man."
31:00;31:04;"They're trying to sell 60-second spots to Budweiser and..."
31:04;31:05;"State Farm."
31:05;31:08;"State Farm for $10-15 million."
31:08;31:11;"You know, and then you go to State Farm and be like, ""Hey, you guys just spent a shitload"
31:11;31:13;"of money on this ad."""
31:13;31:14;"And they're like, ""All right, cool."
31:14;31:16;"What's going to lead us into our ad?"""
31:16;31:19;"And they're just going to be like, ""Well, it's a real hot one this year."
31:19;31:21;"Vampire Weekend versus Tool."""
31:21;31:26;"Just like, ""We're pulling out, man."""
31:26;31:28;"That rules."
31:28;31:29;"Anyway."
31:29;31:30;"But you know what?"
31:30;31:34;"I will say again, I like being part of Pre-Tell culture."
31:34;31:37;"Vampire is Pre-Tell culture because you go there."
31:37;31:39;"I've talked about the NRG before, but whatever."
31:39;31:41;"It only happens once a year."
31:41;31:43;"Might as well go in again."
31:43;31:44;"They classed it up a little bit."
31:44;31:45;"The lights were lower."
31:45;31:48;"In years past, we'd go in and you kind of felt like you're in a convention hall."
31:48;31:49;"This time, the lights were lower."
31:49;31:50;"They actually had a stage."
31:50;31:51;"And there were some cool performances."
31:51;31:52;"So we came in."
31:52;31:55;"In the past, we'd roll up and be like, ""This is so weird."""
31:55;31:57;"Feel almost embarrassed."
31:57;31:58;"Like, ""This is throwaway."
31:58;31:59;"The big show is the real show."""
31:59;32:02;"And actually, this year, they did a great job."
32:02;32:03;"It was dark in the room."
32:03;32:05;"It was like a nicer theater than it used to be in."
32:05;32:10;"And so we got there, and in the 30 minutes before they transitioned to the Rock Awards,"
32:10;32:11;"it was all classical."
32:11;32:14;"And you watch that and you see the people getting on stage."
32:14;32:16;"People gave really nice speeches."
32:16;32:19;"And people were shouting out their mentors."
32:19;32:21;"And you could tell it meant a lot to the people who won."
32:21;32:24;"There was like a quartet playing people on and off."
32:24;32:28;"And as we were watching that, it did kind of like warm my cold heart."
32:28;32:29;"Where I was like, ""This is cool."""
32:29;32:31;"And then I was like, ran to the bathroom."
32:31;32:34;"Then you walk out, and it's like people from all over the world."
32:34;32:39;"Like, friend of the Vampire Weekend and Neo-Yokio Universe, Angelique Kijo, won an award."
32:39;32:41;"It's like, see Angelique."
32:41;32:46;"Then you see there was like a band of Norteno musicians from Mexico."
32:46;32:48;"Everybody got like cowboy hats on and stuff."
32:48;32:49;"And you kind of felt like, ""You know what?"
32:49;32:53;"This is like what you want to imagine a celebration of music is like."""
32:53;32:57;"People from all over the world, different genres, all together,"
32:57;32:59;"and kind of like in a mellow environment,"
32:59;33:01;"which is very different than when you go in a Staples Center."
33:01;33:03;"Not brutally commercial."
33:03;33:04;"Not brutally commercial."
33:04;33:05;"Right."
33:05;33:07;"So anyway, that was actually kind of a good vibe."
33:07;33:10;"And then we sit down, and you know, for the morning of,"
33:10;33:12;"we're all having a good time, and everybody's just kind of like, ""Who cares?"
33:12;33:13;"It doesn't matter."""
33:13;33:16;"You still get nervous when they're announcing the awards."
33:16;33:17;"Sure."
33:17;33:19;"And then they announced Best Rock Song."
33:19;33:20;"We took an L on that one."
33:20;33:22;"Gary Clark Jr. won?"
33:22;33:23;"Oh yeah, he was cleaning up."
33:23;33:25;"He won like three or something."
33:25;33:27;"And then suddenly, it's moving so quick."
33:27;33:29;"And then suddenly, Best Alternative Album."
33:29;33:31;"And then they called it Father of the Bride."
33:31;33:34;"And we rolled down, and it was nice because Steve Lacey was already there,"
33:34;33:36;"and Chris and John, who were both engineers on the record."
33:36;33:38;"So it's like everybody kind of converges."
33:38;33:39;"It took us a while to get down there."
33:39;33:41;"They were up there, and I just like looked around at everybody,"
33:41;33:42;"and I was like, ""This is cool."""
33:42;33:45;"No disrespect, it was a tough category this year."
33:45;33:49;"Friendly with at least James and Justin, both great musicians."
33:49;33:51;"I would have been happy to see them win."
33:51;33:52;"I ride for Big Thief."
33:52;33:53;"That would have been a great win."
33:53;33:55;"Tom York, he doesn't need it."
33:55;33:57;"But he's a legend."
33:57;33:59;"Big Thief was nominated for Best Alternative?"
33:59;34:00;"Yeah, that's tight."
34:00;34:01;"That's tight."
34:01;34:02;"And also, one thing I'll say--"
34:02;34:03;"Good record."
34:03;34:06;"One thing I'll say is the first time we were nominated was for our second album, Contra."
34:06;34:08;"And then of course we lost."
34:08;34:10;"You rarely win the first time."
34:10;34:12;"I'm like, ""You know what, Big Thief."""
34:12;34:13;"Next time around."
34:13;34:14;"I can see it, yeah."
34:14;34:15;"Sure."
34:15;34:17;"If people, we get registered to vote."
34:17;34:18;"[laughs]"
34:18;34:19;"[dog whines]"
34:25;34:29;"♪ Cool autumn rain ♪"
34:29;34:34;"♪ Bugs died and you went shit on the freeway ♪"
34:34;34:39;"♪ Wonder if you'll be the same ♪"
34:39;34:44;"♪ Century's flower ♪"

34:47;34:50;"♪ We have the same power ♪"
34:56;34:59;"So that's not in the huge arena."
34:59;35:00;"No, I think it's--"
35:00;35:02;"Is it called the Microsoft Theater or something?"
35:02;35:03;"But it's like adjacent."
35:03;35:04;"It's adjacent."
35:04;35:05;"It's the same complex."
35:05;35:06;"Then you walk over to Staples."
35:06;35:09;"Then you walk over to Staples and we walked through a car but took some pictures."
35:09;35:12;"As I think I alluded to on the show, I chose to go very cash."
35:12;35:14;"I saw the socks and the--"
35:14;35:17;"I guess they're not Birkenstocks, but I still call that look Stocks and Socks."
35:17;35:18;"Stocks and Socks."
35:18;35:19;"Yeah."
35:19;35:20;"It's actually Chocks and Socks."
35:20;35:21;"What is it?"
35:21;35:22;"Chocos."
35:23;35:24;"Okay."
35:24;35:25;"Not familiar."
35:25;35:26;"It's like a Tiva type brand."
35:26;35:27;"Yeah."
35:27;35:28;"I didn't regret it at all."
35:28;35:29;"Strong choice."
35:29;35:32;"I've been to the Grammys enough that I just knew you can wear literally whatever you want."
35:32;35:36;"You could roll up in the most formal, expensive suit, ball gown, whatever."
35:36;35:38;"You won't seem out of place."
35:38;35:43;"You could do flip-flops, board shorts, and a tank top."
35:43;35:46;"How was Rashida dressed?"
35:46;35:48;"She was a little more formal."
35:48;35:51;"I think she just felt like, ""That's going to make me feel more comfortable."""
35:51;35:53;"We just realized we don't all have to match."
35:53;35:58;"Dave from Chromio, he's always on point with YSL."
35:58;35:59;"But that's him."
35:59;36:01;"He was wearing a nice suit, right?"
36:01;36:02;"Yeah, that's what he looks like."
36:02;36:06;"It would be weirder if he rolled up in shorts."
36:06;36:07;"It just wouldn't be him."
36:07;36:08;"Right."
36:08;36:12;"The morning of, I really questioned, ""Is this going to look just too random?"""
36:12;36:14;"But it's actually the sandals tied it all together."
36:14;36:17;"I didn't put the sandals on until we left the house."
36:17;36:21;"I'm looking in the mirror, and I'm just wearing socks and a corduroy shirt and corduroy pants."
36:21;36:23;"I'm just like, ""Does this look too random?"""
36:23;36:26;"Then I was like, ""Ah, the sandals pull it all together."""
36:26;36:27;"Shoes will do that."
36:27;36:29;"But so, yeah, you do this."
36:29;36:34;"You walk the red carpet, and then you sit down in a Staples Center."
36:34;36:35;"Here's the thing."
36:35;36:39;"I knew that we wouldn't win Album of the Year because we were nominated in our two pre-TEL categories."
36:39;36:43;"We had one TEL award, and that was Album of the Year."
36:43;36:44;"But a couple days before--"
36:44;36:45;"Backroom conversations."
36:45;36:47;"Backroom conversations. These guys aren't TEL."
36:47;36:48;"They're not TEL."
36:48;36:49;"They're not TEL caliber."
36:49;36:52;"Vampires not TEL."
36:52;36:56;"When I looked at all the nominees, and I just thought logically, this was my whole thing."
36:56;37:02;"I was kind of like, ""We definitely don't have the best shot, but I want to be semi-prepared because it's not impossible."
37:02;37:04;"The vote gets split."""
37:04;37:10;"Like, for instance, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lizzo, some of these people are even on the same labels."
37:10;37:13;"There's so many different ways that the vote could go. You never know."
37:13;37:16;"So I was kind of like, ""It's unlikely, but what do we have to say?"""
37:16;37:24;"And then the one thing I got a little stressed out about was to win a TEL award on the day that there's this tragedy,"
37:24;37:28;"and after all these questions are raised about the whole thing."
37:28;37:31;"That award seems a little almost too big to accept."
37:31;37:32;"Dicey."
37:32;37:35;"I was even asking people, ""If we win, do we have to accept it?"""
37:35;37:39;"So I was like, in my head, I never came up with the right thing, but I was thinking, ""What's the right move here?"""
37:39;37:43;"Be like, ""We accept this conditionally if you..."""
37:43;37:49;"Yeah, and then people would roll their eyes, or you'd just be like, ""Thanks,"" which feels funny."
37:49;37:53;"Or it could have just been like, ""Bernie 2020, come out to Cedar Rapids."""
37:53;37:55;"Nothing felt quite right."
37:55;37:59;"But I was thinking about it a little bit, because you need to be somewhat prepared."
37:59;38:02;"And then it dawned on me about two days before, ""We're not going to win."""
38:02;38:05;"And you know why? Because they didn't ask us to play."
38:05;38:08;"And I just really quickly did a roll call in my mind, and I was like,"
38:08;38:12;"""They almost always have the person who wins Album of the Year performs."""
38:12;38:17;"And I was trying to think, ""Well, who are people that you could imagine maybe didn't perform?"""
38:17;38:21;"And one was Beck. And I happened to see Beck, and I said, ""The year you won Album of the Year, did you perform?"""
38:21;38:24;"He said, ""Yeah, yeah, right before the award."""
38:24;38:27;"And I was like, ""Huh. Okay. We're definitely not winning."""
38:27;38:33;"The people who were performing who were nominated were Billie Eilish, Lizzo, Ariana Grande, most of the heavy hitters."
38:33;38:38;"The people who weren't invited to perform--well, I don't want to say invited. I can only speak for us."
38:38;38:42;"But the people who weren't performing that I knew for sure were us, Boney Ver, and Lana Del Rey."
38:42;38:47;"So even in the back of my head, I'm thinking, ""Well, the weird alternative kids. They're not going to win either."""
38:47;38:49;"I mean, Lana Del Rey, she transcends alternative."
38:49;38:51;"I feel like she straddles."
38:51;38:53;"In some ways, she's the perfect AOTY."
38:53;38:54;"True."
38:54;38:59;"A little something for the critics. She got a lot of stands. Wouldn't have been a bad--"
38:59;39:00;"Okay, fair point."
39:00;39:01;"I think people would have been happy about it."
39:01;39:03;"But anyway, I wasn't trying to be a Debbie Downer."
39:03;39:08;"I wasn't trying to tell all these people ahead of time, ""Hey, by the way, you're not going to win."""
39:08;39:11;"But it dawned on me two days earlier. I was like, ""Ah, that's a hell of a theory."""
39:11;39:14;"And I think I'm mostly right about this."
39:14;39:16;"Somebody else can--too bad Seinfeld's not here."
39:16;39:18;"We're going to get him on the phone later, by the way."
39:18;39:21;"It's been too long. Seinfeld's getting busy out there."
39:21;39:23;"But somebody should crunch those numbers."
39:23;39:26;"When was the last time somebody won Album of the Year that didn't perform?"
39:26;39:29;"I don't think it's happened in the past five."
39:29;39:33;"Anyway, we won our award, and now we're rolling into the Stable Center."
39:33;39:35;"So then I'm just like, ""Chill."""
39:35;39:39;"We were all having a good time, just cracking jokes, hanging out."
39:39;39:43;"And then maybe some people listening watched the ceremony."
39:43;39:45;"Watching it in person is just like--"
39:45;39:49;"I'm so curious about how--I haven't watched it on TV in a while, how it comes across."
39:49;39:53;"I think when on TV, people get really mad about it."
39:53;39:58;"When you're there, whether you like the performance or not, you're kind of just seeing it in person."
39:58;40:00;"So you're kind of like, ""All right."""
40:00;40:04;"You know, you don't like Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani's performance."
40:04;40:07;"You're just watching it taken in like, ""Okay, cool."""
40:07;40:10;"So I didn't actually judge the show that much."
40:10;40:13;"You're just kind of all there saying hi to people."
40:13;40:18;"Yeah, you're taking it in. There's no TV director who's guiding your experience."
40:18;40:19;"And also--"
40:19;40:21;"So you're far away, probably."
40:21;40:23;"And the sound is echoing in this big room."
40:23;40:25;"So it's like--when we heard Aerosmith, I was like--"
40:25;40:27;"What was that like?"
40:27;40:28;"It was noisy."
40:28;40:30;"I was like, ""I wonder what this sounds like on TV."""
40:30;40:31;"I couldn't tell."
40:31;40:34;"♪ Something wrong with the world today ♪"
40:34;40:37;"I was like--I saw on Twitter--I didn't watch the show."
40:37;40:38;"But I saw that--"
40:38;40:39;"A clip?"
40:39;40:44;"Yeah, I saw a clip and I saw that they had played ""Living on the Edge"" and I was like, ""That's a deep pull."""
40:44;40:48;"They went ""Living on the Edge"" into ""Walk This Way,"" which makes more sense."
40:48;40:49;"They brought Run DMCA."
40:49;40:50;"Sure."
40:50;40:51;"Yeah, ""Living on the Edge."""
40:51;40:55;"That's like kind of post--kind of like after their glory years."
40:55;40:57;"It was a big album, but--"
40:57;40:58;"Yeah, I mean--"
40:58;40:59;"No, I know what you mean."
40:59;41:00;"It's not--"
41:00;41:01;"It's not one of the big power ballads."
41:01;41:02;"It's not top five Aerosmith."
41:02;41:04;"And it's not one of the '70s classic rock."
41:04;41:05;"It's real kind of deep."
41:05;41:08;"It's top 20, but it's not top five Aerosmith."
41:08;41:10;"It's not even top 10."
41:10;41:14;"I mean, and if I was a huge Aerosmith head, I might be psyched on it."
41:14;41:21;"I guess if they felt like Aerosmith was going to bring in some different energy to the show, an older rock band,"
41:21;41:28;"maybe they just thought about it and they were like, ""Well, which Aerosmith single from their past most speaks to this cultural moment?"""
41:28;41:30;"And they're just like, ""Living on the Edge."""
41:30;41:31;"Right."
41:31;41:34;"A timeless song about a society pushed to the brink."
41:53;41:59;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
41:59;42:04;"A tennis pro that I know, I go to his clinics sometimes during the week."
42:04;42:05;"Oh, really?"
42:05;42:07;"And he's like a real kind of like rock and roll kind of guy."
42:07;42:09;"Like he's like an old '80s rocker kind of guy."
42:09;42:10;"Yeah."
42:10;42:11;"He's probably like 50."
42:11;42:13;"Played in a lot of like kind of like hard rock and metal bands."
42:13;42:14;"Tight."
42:14;42:17;"And he was like, ""You see Aerosmith last night?"""
42:17;42:18;"And I was like, ""No."""
42:18;42:19;"He's like, ""Pathetic."""
42:19;42:20;"Oh."
42:20;42:21;"They play Living on the Edge."
42:21;42:23;"It's like this desperate plea for relevance."
42:23;42:24;"They're trying to be political."
42:24;42:25;"Pathetic."
42:25;42:26;"You know what's funny?"
42:26;42:29;"I was like, ""Nobody hates rock music more than aging rockers."""
42:29;42:36;"It's like, it's literally just like in your life, just like the 30-something dude hanging"
42:36;42:42;"art with you, crushing Chipotle, Rocks Played Out Dog, the former rocker, tennis pro just"
42:42;42:44;"like, ""Absolutely pathetic."""
42:44;42:47;"Well, he was really fired up too because the whole Joey Kramer."
42:47;42:48;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
42:48;42:49;"We should talk about this."
42:49;42:50;"Controversy."
42:50;42:52;"We were talking about this at the ceremony."
42:52;42:54;"Basically, Joey Kramer, I guess, was injured."
42:54;42:57;"He's the drummer of Aerosmith, been playing with them for decades."
42:57;42:58;"Since like the '70s, right?"
42:58;42:59;"Yeah."
42:59;43:01;"And I think so he was like, ""All right, guys, I'm better."
43:01;43:02;"Let me play with you."
43:02;43:03;"Let's get ready for the Grammys."""
43:03;43:04;"And they're like, ""You know what, man?"
43:04;43:05;"You got to audition."""
43:05;43:06;"Wait, so he was injured?"
43:06;43:08;"It wasn't like a drugs and alcohol thing?"
43:08;43:10;"No, I think he was recovering."
43:10;43:11;"Whoa."
43:11;43:12;"But anyway, here's the backstory."
43:12;43:13;"You got to audition."
43:13;43:14;"Here's what Bayo told me."
43:14;43:16;"And I don't know his sources, but-"
43:16;43:17;"Bayo had some hot goss on Aerosmith."
43:17;43:19;"Bayo had some Aerosmith tea."
43:19;43:25;"What Bayo told me was that it wasn't just out of nowhere that Joey Kramer was getting"
43:25;43:28;"pushed away just because he got injured or whatever or had to take a break."
43:28;43:30;"There had already been a lot of tension."
43:30;43:31;"Guess why?"
43:31;43:32;"I have no idea."
43:32;43:33;"Joey Kramer, pro-Trump."
43:33;43:35;"Wow, I love that."
43:35;43:39;"And so apparently it wasn't just them being mean to him because he suffered minor injuries."
43:39;43:41;"It was because things were at a boiling point."
43:41;43:42;"And Bayo said-"
43:42;43:43;"I'm just picturing like the tour bus."
43:43;43:44;"Oh, yeah."
43:44;43:46;"Kramer watching Fox News, ""Can you believe this shit?"
43:46;43:48;"Hey, Joey, chill out, man."""
43:48;43:50;"""That's propaganda, Joey."""
43:50;43:54;"I'm trying to do a Stephen Tyler speaking voice."
43:54;43:59;"I think Bayo said there was something like that Aerosmith, maybe from like an official"
43:59;44:04;"Aerosmith Twitter account or somehow Aerosmith, which I'm sure is mostly controlled by Stephen"
44:04;44:05;"Tyler and Joe Perry."
44:05;44:06;"Yeah."
44:06;44:10;"They had made some public statement about like, ""Fuck Trump,"" or maybe they did a concert"
44:10;44:14;"and met Joey Kramer, I don't know, like on his Facebook page or something like the day"
44:14;44:18;"after that was like, ""Just so you know, these like liberal statements do not speak for Aerosmith"
44:18;44:19;"as a band."""
44:19;44:22;"And you imagine like Stephen Tyler would just be like, ""Mm."""
44:22;44:27;"Anyway, so I read some like reviews of the TV show aspect where people were just like,"
44:27;44:29;"""It's all over the place."""
44:29;44:32;"And I was kind of like, ""It should be all over the place."""
44:32;44:36;"There's a part of me that's like, ""I think it should have been shorter and I won't name"
44:36;44:37;"names."""
44:37;44:40;"I could think of, they should have cut like three or three to four performances."
44:40;44:44;"They could have slimmed it down a bit, but if people are like, ""It's all over the place."
44:44;44:47;"You got to be going from Billie Eilish to like old ass Stephen Tyler."""
44:47;44:49;"And I'm just like, ""Lizzo."""
44:49;44:52;"And then, you know, I'm just like, ""Yeah, that's how it should be."""
44:52;44:53;"Right."
44:53;44:55;"And another funny thing I've been thinking about with the Grammys is again, the corruption"
44:55;44:59;"aside, which I hope they do more to just like be more open about the stuff."
44:59;45:00;"It's rigged, folks."
45:00;45:01;"It's rigged."
45:01;45:03;"The Grammy's very corrupt."
45:03;45:05;"Billie Eilish sweeps."
45:05;45:06;"Come on."
45:06;45:09;"Joey Kramer, not performing."
45:09;45:10;"Imagine."
45:10;45:14;"Also, remember how we talked on the show?"
45:14;45:15;"Because Billie Eilish swept."
45:15;45:21;"She won all four of the big categories, which is the first time that a debut artist has"
45:21;45:24;"done that since Christopher Cross in 1980."
45:24;45:25;"But she swept."
45:25;45:29;"And remember we were talking about how there was this brief tempest in a teapot about how"
45:29;45:31;"she didn't know who Van Halen was."
45:31;45:32;"People were like, ""Oh my God."""
45:32;45:33;"And then, who cares?"
45:33;45:38;"It would be funny if just during one of her acceptance speeches, she just went off about"
45:38;45:39;"the Aerosmith situation."
45:39;45:41;"Be like, ""I thought she didn't like classic rock."""
45:41;45:43;"She's like, ""No, she just doesn't know anything about Van Halen."""
45:43;45:46;"She's like, ""Joey Kramer's the heart and soul of Aerosmith."""
45:46;45:49;"His iconic grooves propelled that band."
45:49;45:51;"And I know people are going to say it's all about Tyler and Joe Perry."
45:51;45:53;"Let me make a case for you."
45:53;45:55;"Joey Kramer, if you're watching, you should have been here."
45:55;45:56;"This one's for you."
45:56;46:01;"You are one of the most underrated drummers in rock history."
46:01;46:07;"And it breaks my heart to see politics come between old friends and old bandmates."
46:07;46:10;"Yeah, afterwards they're just like, ""So you're a big Aerosmith fan?"
46:10;46:12;"Don't know Van Halen?"
46:12;46:13;"Who?"
46:13;46:14;"Oh, that Jimmy Kimmel band?"
46:14;46:15;"Not familiar."
46:15;46:16;"Aerosmith."""
46:16;46:23;"Anyway, I kind of like the randomness of the Grammys because music is hilarious because"
46:23;46:27;"it is even the idea of like, I got asked a few times, we did a handful of interviews,"
46:27;46:29;"""What do you think about being nominated for album of the year?"""
46:29;46:31;"And I was just like, ""Man, it's too much."""
46:31;46:33;"Like, do I think we made a great album?"
46:33;46:34;"Of course I do."
46:34;46:35;"I know we did."
46:35;46:36;"It's a great album."
46:37;46:40;"I just keep wanting to go to Trump."
46:40;46:41;"Oh God."
46:41;46:42;"That's bad news."
46:42;46:45;"If that's just like creeping into my psyche."
46:45;46:48;"Well, he's just be, hopefully just because he is a punchline."
46:48;46:49;"Right."
46:49;46:51;"Treat him as a joke."
46:51;46:55;"Like anytime someone's saying that sort of like, ""Yeah, I'm proud of this."""
46:55;46:56;"Right."
46:56;46:57;"It just turns into Trump."
46:57;46:58;"Yeah, folks."
46:58;46:59;"Yeah, we made a great album."
46:59;47:04;"Anyway, I know it's great, but the idea of, and again, even with like best alternative,"
47:04;47:08;"I know there's people out there probably say like, ""Oh, father brought on that album."
47:08;47:09;"How did that beat this?"""
47:09;47:10;"Like, whatever."
47:10;47:11;"Yeah, of course."
47:11;47:12;"Whatever."
47:12;47:13;"Yeah, of course."
47:13;47:14;"We're psyched."
47:14;47:15;"Our fans are psyched."
47:15;47:17;"People who like that album are psyched."
47:17;47:20;"But again, it's like Contra Lost is an album by the Black Keys."
47:20;47:22;"It's like stuff wins, it doesn't."
47:22;47:26;"At least there's like some vague sense that the category makes sense."
47:26;47:29;"And also one thing that I should note about the Grammys this year,"
47:29;47:31;"and maybe for a long time, I don't really know the rules,"
47:31;47:35;"but you can't vote, people aren't allowed to vote in every category."
47:35;47:39;"So it's like if you vote outside of the big four, everybody can vote in,"
47:39;47:42;"which is best new artist, song, record, album."
47:42;47:47;"If you're voting in like niche categories, such as alternative or regional,"
47:47;47:53;"this or that, or best classical solo, you made a choice to use one of your votes for that."
47:53;47:55;"It's not just like everybody has to click a button."
47:55;47:59;"So, you know, at least there's some type of curation happening"
47:59;48:02;"that voters actually care about that category chose to vote in it,"
48:02;48:04;"versus like if you--"
48:04;48:05;"People randomly."
48:05;48:09;"Yeah, it's like if you got some like old classical cellist to just vote in every category"
48:09;48:13;"and then he just gets to best hip hop and he just sees the first name he recognizes,"
48:13;48:14;"he'll vote for that."
48:14;48:16;"But this gets rid of some of that."
48:16;48:18;"But anyway, once you get to album of the year,"
48:18;48:23;"the idea of like just albums that sound wildly different,"
48:23;48:27;"people of different ages, different backgrounds, it's kind of hilarious."
48:27;48:32;"And anyway, so by the time we got to that category, I was just like, ""We're not going to win."""
48:32;48:34;"By that point, my heart rate didn't go up at all."
48:34;48:36;"I was like, ""We're not going to win this."""
48:36;48:41;"I was kind of surprised that Billie Eilish swept everything, but not that surprised."
48:41;48:43;"First artist since Christopher Cross, huh?"
48:43;48:46;"Maybe first like debut artist."
48:46;48:50;"I guess there's the part of me that, you know, want to see more different people winning."
48:50;48:51;"Right."
48:51;48:55;"But, you know, there's a part of me, it's like, ""Who'd you see up on stage during the TV show part?"""
48:55;49:00;"Taylor, Billie, Lizzo, Dan and Shay representing YouTubers."
49:00;49:01;"Okay."
49:01;49:07;"Anyway, so when I see everybody who got on stage, I'm kind of like, ""Look, this is a big, messy organization"
49:07;49:12;"that clearly has some major things they need to deal with, such as, I mean, these sexual harassment allegations."
49:12;49:15;"Like, come on, they got to be very transparent about that."""
49:15;49:20;"Then when I like, I'm looking at this and I'm like, ""I can't be like mad about this."""
49:20;49:23;"Yeah, there's somewhere in my heart for me generationally,"
49:23;49:26;"I might have wanted to see Lana win album of the year."
49:26;49:29;"I did want to see Lil Nas X win record of the year."
49:29;49:31;"That just seemed like a no-brainer."
49:31;49:34;"But, you know, I'm just kind of like, it's like an interesting mix of people."
49:34;49:36;"You won't remember a year from now."
49:36;49:40;"Yeah, and seeing like a youngish pair of siblings up there who made some,"
49:40;49:44;"started making music by themselves, like, whether it's your cup of tea or not,"
49:44;49:48;"you're like, ""That's like kind of a sweet story. Can't be mad at that."""
49:48;49:51;"Anyway, yeah, so that was the Grammys."
49:51;49:54;"You know, crew went out to some parties, said what's up to some people."
49:54;49:55;"That was that."
49:55;50:01;"We took a vow in summertime, now we find ourselves in late December."
50:01;50:11;"I believe that New Year's Eve will be the perfect time for their great surrender."
50:11;50:14;"But they don't remember."
50:14;50:19;"Anger wants a voice, voices want to sing."
50:19;50:24;"Singers harmonize, till they can't hear anything."
50:24;50:29;"Thought that I was free from all that questioning."
50:29;50:34;"But every time a problem ends, another one begins."
50:34;50:38;"And the stone walls are vomiting all their witness."
50:38;50:43;"Anybody with a world in mind can never forgive the sight."
50:43;50:48;"Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified."
50:48;50:52;"I don't want to live like this, but I don't want to die."
50:53;50:55;"You're listening to..."
50:55;50:59;"Time Crisis on Beat One."
50:59;51:01;"We're in the thick of awards season, man."
51:01;51:03;"Grammys, got the Oscars next weekend, right?"
51:03;51:05;"And today, the Super Bowl."
51:05;51:06;"That's right."
51:06;51:08;"That's a sports award, when you think about it."
51:08;51:09;"For best team."
51:09;51:12;"The Super Bowl is part of awards season."
51:12;51:14;"The only difference is that at these other awards,"
51:14;51:19;"the process of winning happens in smoky backdoor rooms over the course of weeks and months."
51:19;51:22;"Here we actually watch the battle in real time."
51:22;51:23;"Who's playing this year?"
51:23;51:25;"I have no idea."
51:25;51:27;"I was following football a little bit."
51:27;51:28;"We were getting into it a little bit on tour."
51:28;51:29;"That's tight."
51:29;51:34;"Because the Giants had a new quarterback, so half as a joke started to get into the Giants."
51:34;51:37;"Wait, no, I know who's playing. It's the 49ers."
51:37;51:38;"You used to live in San Francisco."
51:38;51:40;"You got any special affinity for them?"
51:40;51:41;"None."
51:41;51:43;"49ers versus the Chiefs?"
51:43;51:45;"Kansas City versus SF?"
51:45;51:47;"Really leaving the East Coast out in the cold."
51:47;51:49;"Patriots fans very upset."
51:49;51:54;"But anyway, we don't really need to talk about the sports element because there's going to be a lot of great ads."
51:54;51:59;"And there's this thing now that they release the ads before the night of."
51:59;52:00;"That is a weird thing."
52:00;52:04;"Yeah, they want people talking about them the week before."
52:04;52:10;"So we've already seen Super Bowl ads released, I guess, for the extremely online people to start talking about."
52:10;52:14;"And then they'll air during the Super Bowl and everybody talks about them."
52:14;52:16;"So I've been paying a little bit of attention."
52:16;52:19;"And one that I'm interested in is for Hyundai."
52:19;52:22;"And we were talking about this on the thread a little bit."
52:22;52:24;"So this is one I watched."
52:24;52:29;"This is a Hyundai commercial that seems to take place in Boston."
52:29;52:34;"And it stars John Krasinski, Rachel Dratch, and Chris Evans."
52:34;52:35;"You know who Chris Evans is?"
52:35;52:36;"I do."
52:36;52:37;"Captain America."
52:37;52:38;"Yep."
52:38;52:39;"So let's listen to it."
52:39;52:41;"Oh, look at this guy."
52:41;52:43;"Chris Evans standing with Rachel Dratch."
52:43;52:44;"Hey, good, how are you?"
52:44;52:46;"He's not getting that car in there."
52:46;52:47;"No, sir."
52:47;52:48;"And they're watching John Krasinski try to park a car."
52:48;52:49;"Look at these two troublemakers."
52:49;52:50;"Hey, Johnny, how are you?"
52:50;52:52;"Wicked car. Is that new?"
52:52;52:54;"Yeah, it's a Sonata. Let me pack it."
52:54;52:55;"Oh, you're not fitting your car in there."
52:55;52:59;"Chris, stop being a smarty-pants, all right?"
52:59;53:01;"Look who's got SmartPak."
53:01;53:02;"SmartPak?"
53:02;53:04;"Just hit the clicker, car packs itself."
53:04;53:05;"It's smart."
53:05;53:06;"But he got out of the car and the car--"
53:06;53:07;"I can pack it anywhere."
53:07;53:08;"How about Dorchester?"
53:08;53:09;"Packed it."
53:09;53:10;"Foxboro?"
53:10;53:11;"Packed it."
53:11;53:12;"The Garden?"
53:12;53:13;"Packed it."
53:13;53:14;"You kidding me?"
53:14;53:15;"I packed it."
53:15;53:16;"And then unpacked it."
53:16;53:17;"You unpacked it?"
53:17;53:19;"Kid, game changer."
53:19;53:21;"That Sonata ain't got no driver."
53:21;53:22;"That's all right. He's got SmartPak."
53:22;53:24;"Hey, look at him back there."
53:24;53:26;"He's got SmartPak."
53:26;53:27;"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
53:27;53:28;"SmartPak."
53:28;53:30;"Then David Ortiz, Big Papi."
53:30;53:32;"So my first question about this, not being from Boston,"
53:32;53:35;"but, you know, not too far away,"
53:35;53:36;"and being familiar with Boston culture,"
53:36;53:38;"and this is what I asked the thread,"
53:38;53:39;"this is a very Twitter phrase,"
53:39;53:41;"why is this okay?"
53:41;53:44;"I'm thinking, and this might be from more of a New York perspective,"
53:44;53:49;"but I'm like, okay, I get that all these people are from the Boston area,"
53:49;53:52;"but none of them actually have the accent."
53:52;53:54;"I get it could be fun in a commercial,"
53:54;53:58;"you like bring somebody who has like a very strong regional accent."
53:58;54:01;"That's like a way that people get, you know,"
54:01;54:04;"a memorable performance when somebody has a cool accent,"
54:04;54:06;"but none of these people actually talk like that."
54:06;54:08;"Yeah, Dorchester?"
54:08;54:09;"Dorchester?"
54:09;54:10;"SmartPak."
54:10;54:11;"Hey, Rachel."
54:11;54:13;"So I'm watching, I'm like, I know you guys are all actors,"
54:13;54:16;"but like it's weird that Chris Evans is like,"
54:16;54:20;"""Hey, Rachel, hey, Rachel, hey, quit being such a smarty-pit."""
54:20;54:22;"Like they're doing this like extreme Boston accent,"
54:22;54:24;"and I'm kind of like, and I might be wrong here,"
54:24;54:25;"but my first thought was like,"
54:25;54:27;"isn't that kind of like a working class Boston accent?"
54:27;54:29;"It's like you really have that accent."
54:29;54:30;"Maybe I'm wrong."
54:30;54:31;"I thought it was like a South Boston accent."
54:31;54:32;"Sure, yeah."
54:32;54:34;"So the first thing that I said on the thread,"
54:34;54:36;"I was like, just picture the New York version,"
54:36;54:39;"where you get some iconic people who are from New York,"
54:39;54:43;"and the examples I came up with were Scarlett Johansson,"
54:43;54:44;"born and raised in New York City,"
54:44;54:47;"Timothy Chalamet, and Donald Trump Jr."
54:47;54:50;"All New Yorkers, but who don't talk like New Yorkers."
54:50;54:52;"Yeah, they're from Manhattan."
54:52;54:53;"Yeah, they're from Manhattan."
54:53;54:56;"They all speak in a, I won't say an upper crust way,"
54:56;54:58;"but they don't have the vibe."
54:58;54:59;"I see what you're saying."
54:59;55:00;"So I'm saying, then there's one over there in Brooklyn,"
55:00;55:02;"and it's just like Timothy Chalamet would be like,"
55:02;55:05;"""Hey, Scarlett, where you park the car?"
55:05;55:07;"Hey, shut up, shut up, Timmy."
55:07;55:10;"Hey, Chalamet. Hey, Chalamet, you shut up."""
55:10;55:12;"And then Don Jr. just comes down and like,"
55:12;55:14;"""Oh, what are you guys talking about?"
55:14;55:17;"Forget all. Oh, you gotta park the car."""
55:17;55:18;"Like, if you did that in New York,"
55:18;55:20;"there'd be like riots, 'cause people would be like,"
55:20;55:23;"""Why are you trying to steal our cool Brooklyn accent?"
55:23;55:25;"You guys didn't live this shit."""
55:25;55:27;"So you think Krasinski, Evans, and Dratch"
55:27;55:29;"are a little too upper crust?"
55:29;55:31;"'Cause what if they had gotten Wahlberg?"
55:31;55:32;"Is there a world in which-"
55:32;55:33;"Well, Wahlberg was more of a working class guy."
55:33;55:35;"That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm asking."
55:35;55:37;"So if they had gotten Wahlberg,"
55:37;55:39;"Damon's not working class background,"
55:39;55:41;"but let's just say he's an iconic-"
55:41;55:43;"First of all, I didn't know that any of those three people"
55:43;55:45;"were from Boston. I had no idea."
55:45;55:48;"When I think Boston, I think Damon, Affleck, Wahlberg."
55:48;55:49;"I think the Departed."
55:49;55:50;"Matt Damon pulls up,"
55:50;55:52;"""Hey, none of you even in the Departed."
55:52;55:54;"You weren't even in the Departed."
55:54;55:56;"You got a smart parking car."
55:56;55:57;"You weren't in the Departed."""
55:57;55:59;"But if they did a Departed reunion,"
55:59;56:01;"that would have been amazing."
56:01;56:02;"I see what you're saying."
56:02;56:04;"I mean, so like in the New York version,"
56:04;56:05;"they should have gotten like-"
56:05;56:07;"Bernie Sanders."
56:07;56:10;"Yeah, and even though Joe Pesci's from Jersey,"
56:10;56:11;"those kind of actors."
56:11;56:12;"Yeah, or if you-"
56:12;56:14;"Let's say you were doing something about New Yorkers"
56:14;56:16;"who have a real New York accent."
56:16;56:17;"Danny Aiello."
56:17;56:19;"And even, obviously, in any city,"
56:19;56:21;"you have a diversity of accents."
56:21;56:22;"You get Danny Aiello."
56:22;56:24;"You could even get Barbra Streisand,"
56:24;56:25;"Cardi B."
56:25;56:26;"She has her own kind of New York accent."
56:26;56:27;"Rosie Perez."
56:27;56:28;"Exactly."
56:28;56:29;"If you wanted to make it like"
56:29;56:31;"people who really lean into their accents,"
56:31;56:33;"you could have Rosie Perez"
56:33;56:34;"just being like,"
56:34;56:36;"""Oh my God, who's this old idiot"
56:36;56:37;"trying to park the car?"""
56:37;56:38;"And then he like, window goes down,"
56:38;56:39;"it's Bernie Sanders."
56:39;56:41;"He's like, ""Hey, Rosie, give me-"
56:41;56:43;"Rosie, let's be clear,"
56:43;56:44;"I'm trying to park this car."""
56:44;56:45;"You could have fun with it,"
56:45;56:46;"but those are all real accents."
56:46;56:47;"And then if Timoth-"
56:47;56:49;"Bernie Sanders and a Hyundai-"
56:49;56:53;"""Hey, Jay-Z, wanna be in this Hyundai ad"
56:53;56:56;"with Rosie Perez and Bernie Sanders?"""
56:56;56:58;"A lesser person would, straight up."
56:58;57:01;"A lesser political candidate would 100% be in it."
57:01;57:03;"Yeah, but just like all old school New York-"
57:03;57:04;"Larry David."
57:04;57:05;"I'm sure somebody has pitched that,"
57:05;57:06;"where they're just like,"
57:06;57:08;"""Here's a Super Bowl ad for you."
57:08;57:10;"Larry David and Bernie Sanders"
57:10;57:12;"and Jay-Z and Rosie Perez."
57:12;57:15;"And it's a real New York moment."
57:15;57:17;"Real New Yorkers."""
57:17;57:18;"Anyway,"
57:18;57:20;"New York's a bigger city than Boston,"
57:20;57:21;"but still like any city,"
57:21;57:22;"you got your divisions."
57:22;57:24;"And at least in New York,"
57:24;57:25;"your accent,"
57:25;57:26;"it could be a badge of pride,"
57:26;57:28;"where exactly you're from,"
57:28;57:30;"or something that maybe you even used to be ashamed of,"
57:30;57:33;"and then you see Timothy Chalamet."
57:33;57:34;"Just picture it."
57:34;57:36;"Somebody who really is from Brooklyn."
57:36;57:37;"And even within Brooklyn,"
57:37;57:39;"I'm sure people get mad."
57:39;57:42;"This'll happen more in gentrified North Brooklyn,"
57:42;57:43;"but if in 30 years,"
57:43;57:44;"they're doing an ad where"
57:44;57:46;"it's a bunch of Brooklyn people,"
57:46;57:47;"and then somebody's like,"
57:47;57:49;"""Wait, this kid was born and raised"
57:49;57:51;"Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint?"
57:51;57:52;"F*** outta here."
57:52;57:53;"You know, like,"
57:53;57:57;"this kid was born in 2025 in Greenpoint?"
57:57;57:58;"Oh my God,"
57:58;58:00;"I feel like I'm wrong."
58:00;58:02;"(laughter)"
58:02;58:04;"So I asked the thread,"
58:04;58:08;"'cause I don't really know any real Boston people,"
58:08;58:12;"and you and Nick both knew some real Boston people."
58:12;58:13;"I think Matt, not me."
58:13;58:14;"Oh, Matt."
58:14;58:16;"Yeah, Matt and Nick both knew some real Boston people,"
58:16;58:18;"and you guys sent it to the most Boston-ass,"
58:18;58:19;"I don't want to say Bostonian,"
58:19;58:21;"that doesn't sound right."
58:21;58:23;"And generally, everybody was like,"
58:23;58:24;"They loved it."
58:24;58:25;"""Oh, we love it!"""
58:25;58:26;"Wicked."
58:26;58:27;"I mean, it's a funny ad."
58:27;58:29;"Just straight up, in the most basic way."
58:29;58:30;"But I guess what we determined,"
58:30;58:33;"and I'd love to hear from any Boston TC heads,"
58:33;58:35;"is that in Boston,"
58:35;58:37;"everybody's Boston strong."
58:37;58:39;"I guess it also helps that with the Boston accent,"
58:39;58:41;"it's not crossing racial lines."
58:41;58:43;"That would be very uncomfortable."
58:43;58:44;"A bunch of rich white actors"
58:44;58:46;"doing an accent from their city"
58:46;58:48;"that no white people had."
58:48;58:50;"That would be some angry letters."
58:50;58:53;"But it generally seems that people,"
58:53;58:55;"I guess there's a type of Boston pride,"
58:55;58:56;"where it's like,"
58:56;58:57;"""Hey, look!"
58:57;58:59;"""Bunch of rich Boston actors."
58:59;59:01;"""They're paying tribute to us."""
59:01;59:02;"In New York, I don't think it would be seen"
59:02;59:03;"as paying tribute."
59:03;59:05;"Yeah, and I think in your example,"
59:05;59:06;"of the New York example,"
59:06;59:07;"you went really upper crust."
59:07;59:08;"You went like,"
59:08;59:11;"Noah Baumbach film cast."
59:11;59:13;"Noah Baumbach's from Brooklyn."
59:13;59:14;"Oh, is he?"
59:14;59:15;"Okay, you're right."
59:15;59:16;"You're totally right."
59:16;59:17;"For the new Hyundai Sonata ad,"
59:17;59:18;"we got Noah Baumbach,"
59:18;59:19;"Paul Giamatti,"
59:19;59:20;"Noah Baumbach,"
59:20;59:21;"Paul Giamatti,"
59:21;59:23;"Adam Driver."
59:25;59:28;"I like the idea of regional car ads, though."
59:28;59:31;"Like if there was a Hyundai ad for LA,"
59:31;59:32;"and it was just like,"
59:32;59:34;"""Malibu burnout dudes."""
59:34;59:35;"Yeah."
59:35;59:37;"But again,"
59:37;59:39;"they'd probably get famous actors."
59:39;59:40;"Get McConaughey, dude."
59:40;59:41;"We should pitch that."
59:41;59:42;"We should get Kyle."
59:42;59:43;"Oh, yeah, dude."
59:43;59:44;"To do--"
59:44;59:45;"You get Jeff Bridges,"
59:45;59:46;"Matthew McConaughey,"
59:46;59:47;"and Kyle Field."
59:47;59:48;"To do--"
59:48;59:49;"Well, McConaughey's Texas."
59:49;59:50;"He's due Texas."
59:50;59:51;"Yeah, but he could do it."
59:51;59:52;"Yeah, just to get chilled out,"
59:52;59:54;"chilled out kind of surfer bros"
59:54;59:55;"just being like,"
59:55;59:57;"""Dude, how are you going to park the car, man?"""
59:57;59:59;"He's like, ""Oh, dude, I got Smart Park."""
59:59;01:00:00;"""What? What did he say?"""
01:00:00;01:00:02;"""He said he's got Smart Park."""
01:00:02;01:00:03;"""What?"""
01:00:03;01:00:05;"And it's like a very stressful"
01:00:05;01:00:08;"parallel parking situation on the PCH."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"It was just cars going,"
01:00:09;01:00:10;"""Few, few,"""
01:00:10;01:00:12;"flying by at like 80 miles an hour."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"You know what would rule, too?"
01:00:13;01:00:14;"There's another character"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"who's super high on the PCH,"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"and he's holding his hands to his head,"

01:02:31;01:02:32;"It's kind of endearing."
01:02:32;01:02:33;"It puts a smile on your face."

01:02:43;01:02:45;"Yeah, because maybe somebody's like, ""Listen, you got it wrong."
01:02:45;01:02:47;"It's not really a working class accent."""
01:02:47;01:02:51;"So you're trying to bring your Bernie Sanders class war [bleep] into this."
01:02:51;01:02:52;"It's not your misunderstanding."
01:02:52;01:02:55;"That accent doesn't read as the working people of Boston"
01:02:55;01:02:59;"being parodied by rich actors from the suburbs,"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"which in another city it could."

01:03:06;01:03:09;"Another one that caught my eye that I saw was the Snickers one."
01:03:09;01:03:10;"This one's insane."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"This one's very strange."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"It's called #SnickersFixTheWorld."
01:03:13;01:03:17;"Just for comparison's sake, to be fair, this one doesn't have any celebrities in it,"
01:03:17;01:03:20;"but you just said that one had 17 million views already."
01:03:20;01:03:22;"This one has 35,000."

01:03:34;01:03:45;"[singing]"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"So we're being the world of Snickers?"
01:03:47;01:03:48;"Yep."

01:03:49;01:03:52;"[singing]"
01:03:52;01:03:53;"Okay, I hate this."

01:03:54;01:03:57;"It seems a little dated already,"
01:03:57;01:04:00;"but it's like the thing is all these people complaining."
01:04:00;01:04:04;"And they chose a diverse array of 20, 30-something people"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"to be complaining about this changing world,"
01:04:06;01:04:09;"because I don't think they wanted it to be old boomers complaining."
01:04:09;01:04:12;"But it's still-- Yeah, it's a little bit like,"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"""What is all this? Oh, my God."""
01:04:14;01:04:17;"So this woman, for instance, now they keep reinventing milk,"

01:04:28;01:04:30;"[laughs]"
01:04:30;01:04:33;"But I feel like they're also saying that the world's kind of out of sorts"
01:04:33;01:04:35;"in a larger sense."
01:04:35;01:04:37;"Yeah, I think as they go on, they talk about politics a little bit."
01:04:37;01:04:40;"And a lot of people-- It's funny that it's airing during the Super Bowl,"
01:04:40;01:04:42;"because people are going to be like--"
01:04:42;01:04:47;"Football is going to be truly 50-50 with the MAGA nation"

01:04:48;01:04:49;"Well, that's a classic way to--"

01:04:53;01:04:56;"Well, no, that's not true, because the MAGA world,"
01:04:56;01:04:58;"they're happy with losing the White House,"
01:04:58;01:05:01;"but that's because the world is so out of sorts."

01:09:30;01:09:33;"They keep using this phrase, ""The world is out of sorts."""
01:09:33;01:09:34;"Right."
01:09:34;01:09:35;"So, ""The world is out of sorts."""

01:09:37;01:09:40;"Right. ""The world is out of sorts."""
01:09:40;01:09:42;"Yeah, it's also a very horror movie."
01:09:42;01:09:43;"Just like, ""What'd you say, Grandma?"""
01:09:43;01:09:44;"""The world is out of sorts."""
01:09:44;01:09:45;"""What?"""
01:09:45;01:09:48;"And then like suddenly the little kid in the world is out of sorts."

01:10:05;01:10:07;"Okay, part of the bonus features."
01:10:07;01:10:08;"Yeah, bonus features."
01:10:08;01:10:10;"And people are like, ""Man, why you got to rag on DJs?"""
01:10:10;01:10:15;"And so already this, knowingly or not, Snickers is really pushing a sore spot,"
01:10:15;01:10:18;"which is this kind of like generational thing."
01:10:18;01:10:21;"You know, this kind of like millennials and young people getting blamed for everything."

01:10:26;01:10:29;"So anyway, I kind of wonder what the conversation was."
01:10:29;01:10:33;"Like, I bet Snickers is probably a little bit on the ropes these days"
01:10:33;01:10:38;"because it's a candy bar and now, like, you know, here at Apple,"
01:10:38;01:10:41;"we have bars like Humming Bar with a hummingbird on it,"
01:10:41;01:10:43;"Honey and Cinnamon Hemp Bar."

01:10:48;01:10:50;"I'm not seeing a lot of Snickers on campus."
01:10:50;01:10:54;"That'd be so tight if we just came into the studio here and there was like some Snickers."
01:10:54;01:10:56;"Yeah, just like king size."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"I'd be down, dude."
01:10:57;01:11:01;"I have to say, I think Snickers should go back to the classic, ""Snickers satisfies."""
01:11:01;01:11:03;"I think that was a great campaign."
01:11:03;01:11:06;"And I've been in situations where I'm like, ""God, I'm kind of hungry,"
01:11:06;01:11:10;"but I don't want to get like a full burrito or a bunch of tacos right now."""
01:11:10;01:11:11;"You know what I'm going to do?"

01:11:13;01:11:14;"I'm going to get a Snickers."
01:11:14;01:11:15;"It's like 3 in the afternoon."
01:11:15;01:11:16;"You've done that?"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"Dude, on the reg."
01:11:18;01:11:19;"And is it because--"
01:11:19;01:11:20;"I'm probably eating like--"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"Is it because their advertising just worked on you?"
01:11:22;01:11:23;"Yes."
01:11:24;01:11:26;"I think of the construction worker, like, on the I-beam,"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"and it's like, ""Snickers satisfies."""
01:11:28;01:11:29;"Like those hearty peanuts."
01:11:29;01:11:30;"Yeah."
01:11:30;01:11:33;"I'm probably doing like 1.5 Snickers a month."
01:11:33;01:11:34;"That's my go-to bar."
01:11:34;01:11:35;"That's insane to me."
01:11:35;01:11:37;"And especially because you're purchasing them."
01:11:37;01:11:40;"Somebody might eat a Snickers, like, you know, on Halloween,"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"but you're like--you're purchasing them."
01:11:42;01:11:43;"Go-to bar."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"I'll say, you know, we've been pretty hard on Snickers so far,"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"but I also have warm feelings towards Snickers."
01:11:47;01:11:48;"Hell yeah."
01:11:48;01:11:53;"I always thought of Snickers as being like a dependable, classy candy bar."
01:11:53;01:11:56;"It's also funny to think that I'm sure like nutrition-wise,"
01:11:56;01:11:59;"Snickers is no better or worse than any other chocolate bar,"
01:11:59;01:12:02;"but the idea that--I mean, it is a good one, too."
01:12:02;01:12:03;"It has a little more heft."
01:12:03;01:12:04;"But also--"
01:12:04;01:12:05;"In like a milky way."
01:12:05;01:12:06;"It satisfies."
01:12:07;01:12:09;"You roll to--you're just like, ""Damn, I'm hungry,"""
01:12:09;01:12:11;"and you like roll to the corner store,"
01:12:11;01:12:13;"and you're just like, ""Butterfinger?"""
01:12:13;01:12:14;"And just like--"
01:12:14;01:12:15;"Oh, dude."
01:12:15;01:12:17;"No, I'm a grown man."
01:12:17;01:12:18;"I'll get a Snickers."
01:12:18;01:12:20;"Butterfinger's messed up."
01:12:20;01:12:24;"Even as a kid, I was like, ""This is a f---ed up candy bar."""
01:12:24;01:12:25;"Well, and they always knew it."
01:12:25;01:12:26;"Impossible to eat."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"They always knew that they were f---ed up."
01:12:28;01:12:30;"That's why they got Bart Simpson."
01:12:30;01:12:33;"They were like, ""Listen, we're not classy like the Snickers."
01:12:33;01:12:36;"The Butterfingers brand is chaotic."""
01:12:36;01:12:39;"Bart Simpson just like skateboarding, stealing s---."
01:12:39;01:12:41;"Our mascot's an eight-year-old boy."
01:12:41;01:12:43;"[laughter]"
01:12:43;01:12:46;"Crispity, crunchity, peanut buttery."
01:12:46;01:12:48;"And his catchphrase is,"
01:12:48;01:12:51;"""Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger."""
01:12:51;01:12:53;"They're like, ""Listen, maybe you're just like"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"a salt-of-the-earth construction worker."""
01:12:55;01:12:57;"Okay, what's that guy eating?"
01:12:57;01:12:58;"A Snickers."
01:12:58;01:13:00;"He's a good man working hard for his family."
01:13:00;01:13:04;"But Butterfinger, we're appealing to the chaotic evil."
01:13:04;01:13:06;"We're appealing to the gluttons."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"We want selfish people."
01:13:08;01:13:11;"You better not touch my f---ing Butterfinger!"
01:13:11;01:13:12;"Don't you touch my f---ing Butterfinger!"
01:13:12;01:13:15;"I honestly can't believe that Butterfinger's on the market."
01:13:15;01:13:18;"Because that suggests there's people that are buying it regularly."
01:13:18;01:13:19;"Well, first of all--"
01:13:19;01:13:22;"Like, who the hell is eating Butterfinger's on the reg?"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"I think Butterfinger's taste good."
01:13:24;01:13:27;"But the texture is so screwed up, dude."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"It is--"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"It's mystifying."
01:13:30;01:13:31;"And it's like orange."
01:13:31;01:13:32;"Yeah."
01:13:32;01:13:33;"No, it's so dense."
01:13:33;01:13:34;"It's almost like--"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"Like some sort of like a waste product."
01:13:36;01:13:38;"It's dense and flaky."
01:13:38;01:13:39;"At the same time."
01:13:39;01:13:40;"Right."
01:13:40;01:13:41;"It's like very dry."
01:13:41;01:13:44;"I think--"
01:13:44;01:13:45;"This sounds like we might have covered it before,"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"but I also remember being a kid and just being like,"
01:13:47;01:13:49;"""I like Butterfingers."""
01:13:49;01:13:51;"Although, I like all these things in the smaller bites."
01:13:51;01:13:54;"A king-sized Butterfinger or Snickers is disgusting."
01:13:54;01:13:56;"But I like Butterfinger."
01:13:56;01:13:58;"And I just remember when Bart Simpson used to be like,"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"""Crispy, crunchy, peanut buttery."""
01:14:00;01:14:03;"And I'd just be like, ""Peanut butter? Is that what this s--- is?"""
01:14:03;01:14:05;"Because it doesn't taste like peanut butter."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"It's so weird."
01:14:07;01:14:08;"It's a very chaotic candy."
01:14:08;01:14:14;"♪ ...terrorized flickering as you pull up to the truck stop ♪"
01:14:14;01:14:21;"♪ The same old crowd was hanging out again tonight ♪"
01:14:21;01:14:28;"♪ He said, ""Fill up my tank while I go check my load"" ♪"
01:14:28;01:14:33;"♪ It feels like it's shifting all around ♪"

01:15:02;01:15:04;"So Snickers is the third biggest bar in America."
01:15:04;01:15:08;"After Reese's and Hershey's."
01:15:08;01:15:10;"Well, just a plain Hershey's."
01:15:10;01:15:13;"Who's buying a straight up plain Hershey's bar?"
01:15:13;01:15:15;"But Snickers used to be the big one."
01:15:15;01:15:17;"Snickers used to be the Coca-Cola to me."
01:15:17;01:15:19;"It still is, dude."
01:15:19;01:15:21;"But I guess they must be down because"
01:15:21;01:15:22;"they used to just be able to be like,"
01:15:22;01:15:25;"""Eat us when you're hungry. We're the classy bar."
01:15:25;01:15:26;"You can eat us when you're hungry."""
01:15:26;01:15:28;"It's not like getting a Butterfinger."
01:15:28;01:15:31;"But now it's like this weird thing where they're trying to appeal to like"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"older people or something."
01:15:33;01:15:35;"I think they're just overthinking it, man."
01:15:35;01:15:37;"I think they're lashing out at a world that rejected them."
01:15:37;01:15:40;"I mean, do we have evidence that their sales are down?"
01:15:40;01:15:43;"I mean, this is really getting in the weeds here."
01:15:43;01:15:45;"But like, I don't even, I mean."
01:15:45;01:15:46;"We'll look it up for next time."
01:15:46;01:15:49;"I doubt the premise that their sales are down."
01:15:49;01:15:50;"No, no, I can picture this."
01:15:50;01:15:52;"This is Don Draper talking to them."
01:15:52;01:15:55;"It's like, ""Gentlemen, you're dead and you don't even know it."""
01:15:55;01:15:57;"Sales are down for the fifth straight quarter."
01:15:57;01:15:59;"Look at what's happening in our society."
01:15:59;01:16:02;"Kids out there on the streets protesting."
01:16:02;01:16:05;"You think Greta Thunberg wants to eat a Snickers?"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"No, not at all."
01:16:07;01:16:09;"Here's how I can save you."
01:16:09;01:16:10;"Greta Van Fleet."
01:16:10;01:16:11;"Yeah."
01:16:11;01:16:12;"Now they're eating Snickers."
01:16:12;01:16:13;"Now you guys are--"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"[laughter]"
01:16:15;01:16:17;"Hey, guess what, guys?"
01:16:17;01:16:18;"You're the old guard now."
01:16:18;01:16:21;"You used to be doing your funny ads in the '90s and 2000s,"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"but now you're old school."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"I hate to tell you, but Rock's played out."
01:16:25;01:16:26;"Yeah."
01:16:26;01:16:30;"In the '90s, you had Rock, MTV, Budweiser was like cool."
01:16:30;01:16:32;"They always had like the funny ads."
01:16:32;01:16:33;"Spuds, dude."
01:16:33;01:16:34;"Yeah."
01:16:34;01:16:36;"Spuds McKenzie, dude."
01:16:36;01:16:42;"But now Budweiser, Rock Music, MTV, and Snickers,"
01:16:42;01:16:44;"that's the old guard, man."
01:16:44;01:16:46;"And so I guess you have a choice to either reinvent yourself"
01:16:46;01:16:49;"and be like, ""Listen, we're going to learn from the youth,"""
01:16:49;01:16:52;"or you have a chance to become conservative,"
01:16:52;01:16:53;"and Snickers made their choice."
01:16:53;01:16:54;"They're conservative now."
01:16:54;01:16:56;"They should do Snickers Classic."
01:16:56;01:16:59;"You know what they've been doing, actually, on the rappers"
01:16:59;01:17:01;"is putting weird words."
01:17:01;01:17:02;"Have you noticed that?"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"I don't eat 12 to 15 Snickers a year."
01:17:04;01:17:05;"I'm--"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"Oh, yeah, yeah, that say like--"
01:17:07;01:17:08;"I have seen this."
01:17:08;01:17:09;"They say like awkward or like--"
01:17:09;01:17:10;"What do they say?"
01:17:10;01:17:14;"Rebellious, snappy, spacey, goofball, loopy."
01:17:14;01:17:17;"I feel like I've seen weirder ones like awkward or like--"
01:17:17;01:17:18;"Although I like that."
01:17:18;01:17:20;"Maybe they're like, ""This is like a fun, confused--"""
01:17:20;01:17:21;"Yeah, I've seen--"
01:17:21;01:17:23;"But in the Snickers font."
01:17:23;01:17:24;"Yeah."
01:17:24;01:17:25;"Hangry."
01:17:25;01:17:26;"Hangry, that's a good one."
01:17:26;01:17:28;"Maybe that campaign was to appeal to young people,"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"and this one's to appeal to old people."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"But this is kind of Snickers going Trump,"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"just like the world's changing,"
01:17:34;01:17:37;"and let me tell you, folks, it's not for the better."
01:17:37;01:17:38;"It's not pretty."
01:17:38;01:17:40;"Snickers is basically saying make Snickers great again."
01:17:40;01:17:41;"Hate to see it."
01:17:42;01:17:43;"Rough stuff."
01:17:43;01:17:45;"There's something just weird about this commercial"
01:17:45;01:17:49;"because it's all these downtown urban professionals"
01:17:49;01:17:52;"at the farmer's market at the bourgeois coffee shop,"
01:17:52;01:17:57;"diverse racially, all look like graphic designers,"
01:17:57;01:17:58;"people who, you know--"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"Not eating Snickers."
01:18:00;01:18:02;"But then they're putting these kind of conservative ideas"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"into their mouths."
01:18:04;01:18:05;"What's up with that?"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"Like the young guy at the farmer's market being like,"
01:18:07;01:18:09;"""What's happening in the world today?"
01:18:09;01:18:10;"Ew."""
01:18:10;01:18:11;"It's weird."
01:18:11;01:18:13;"It would have been almost cooler if they just made it"
01:18:13;01:18:14;"confused old people who are just like,"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"""What's happening to the world?"""
01:18:16;01:18:18;"Because then actually kids would find that funny."
01:18:18;01:18:19;"Yeah."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"It's like how kids love The Office."
01:18:21;01:18:23;"The youth today, like Billie Eilish, for instance,"
01:18:23;01:18:26;"she claims she's seen The Office like 12 times,"
01:18:26;01:18:27;"the whole series."
01:18:27;01:18:28;"Twelve?"
01:18:28;01:18:29;"Something like that."
01:18:29;01:18:30;"That's so deep."
01:18:30;01:18:32;"She like samples The Office on her album."
01:18:32;01:18:33;"I once read this interesting article."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"That is incredibly lame fantasy."
01:18:35;01:18:36;"I think I've talked about that with Nick before."
01:18:36;01:18:38;"Somebody wrote this article where they were saying"
01:18:38;01:18:41;"why some movies that are made by older people"
01:18:41;01:18:44;"that are about teenagers haven't really--"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"There hasn't been a hit teenage movie in a long time,"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"even though there have been some decent attempts."
01:18:48;01:18:49;"Booksmart?"
01:18:49;01:18:50;"Well, this article--"
01:18:50;01:18:51;"Booksmart wasn't a hit."
01:18:51;01:18:53;"No, it kind of was, but yeah."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"Not--"
01:18:54;01:18:55;"Critical."
01:18:55;01:18:56;"It was a critical hit."
01:18:56;01:18:59;"You live in a liberal bubble, Jake."
01:18:59;01:19:01;"Out in Snickers country?"
01:19:01;01:19:02;"Didn't do numbers."
01:19:02;01:19:03;"But--"
01:19:03;01:19:05;"But I'm in Snickers country."
01:19:05;01:19:06;"True."
01:19:07;01:19:08;"You straddle worlds."
01:19:08;01:19:10;"But the thesis of this thing was like"
01:19:10;01:19:14;"Booksmart had the potential to be the teen movie of this era."
01:19:14;01:19:15;"Yeah."
01:19:15;01:19:16;"This is not my viewpoint."
01:19:16;01:19:17;"This is the article."
01:19:17;01:19:18;"And they're like, it didn't connect."
01:19:18;01:19:21;"Even though it seems to be a fun movie that people like."
01:19:21;01:19:24;"Obama said it was one of his favorite movies of the year,"
01:19:24;01:19:27;"but at the end of the day, Obama's in his 50s."
01:19:27;01:19:29;"And then, look, this is this guy's thesis."
01:19:29;01:19:32;"But he says, because you know what really has connected with teenagers?"
01:19:32;01:19:33;"The office."
01:19:33;01:19:35;"And then you could get into, well, the office is streaming"
01:19:35;01:19:36;"and Booksmart is a movie, whatever."
01:19:36;01:19:38;"That's an important point, too."
01:19:38;01:19:40;"But he was like, because the office is cringe humor."
01:19:40;01:19:43;"So anyway, it wouldn't shock me if you could do some ad for Snickers"
01:19:43;01:19:49;"that like, rather than showing like young urban professional yuppie 20-year-olds,"
01:19:49;01:19:53;"just showed all weird old people just being confused and like angry."
01:19:53;01:19:56;"And just talking about how they need to feed the world to Snickers."
01:19:56;01:19:57;"Who knows?"
01:19:57;01:20:00;"That might win over some irony poisoned young people."
01:20:00;01:20:03;"And then just go in full midsummer with the mass suicide at the end."
01:20:03;01:20:04;"Yeah."
01:20:04;01:20:06;"[laughter]"
01:20:06;01:20:07;"I'm on board."
01:20:07;01:20:09;"We've opened a whole can of worms."
01:20:09;01:20:10;"We're getting in--"
01:20:10;01:20:13;"First of all, if anybody worked on the Snickers ad, just hit us up."
01:20:13;01:20:17;"That could be a cool new segment on TC, just like actual advertising people."
01:20:17;01:20:19;"Just be like-- and they probably sign NDAs and stuff."
01:20:19;01:20:20;"Yeah."
01:20:20;01:20:21;"Anonymous hotline."
01:20:21;01:20:22;"It could be an anonymous hotline, yes."
01:20:22;01:20:24;"If you worked on the Snickers campaign, call us."
01:20:24;01:20:26;"Use one of those voice changers."
01:20:26;01:20:30;"Just be like, ""Listen, the client was very--"
01:20:30;01:20:31;"[laughter]"
01:20:31;01:20:37;"""The client was really clear that we needed to say 'f*** you' to the younger people."""
01:20:37;01:20:40;"That ad, the Snickers ad, was directed by Tom Kuntz."
01:20:40;01:20:42;"Oh, hey!"
01:20:42;01:20:43;"That's messed up."
01:20:43;01:20:44;"Hey!"
01:20:44;01:20:45;"How do you spell that?"
01:20:45;01:20:47;"K-U-N-T-S."
01:20:47;01:20:49;"That's so f***ed up."
01:20:49;01:20:50;"T-Z, right?"
01:20:50;01:20:51;"T-Z, right."
01:20:51;01:20:52;"T-Z."
01:20:52;01:20:53;"Holy s***."
01:20:53;01:20:55;"I was f***ing off guard because I hadn't said it out loud."
01:20:55;01:20:56;"That's a name."
01:20:56;01:20:57;"I didn't expect it to sound the way it sounded."
01:20:57;01:20:58;"Oh, Kuntz."
01:20:58;01:20:59;"Kuntz."
01:20:59;01:21:00;"It's like Dean Kuntz."
01:21:00;01:21:01;"Nobody spelled it differently."
01:21:01;01:21:02;"Two O's."
01:21:02;01:21:04;"I went to-- there was somebody--"
01:21:04;01:21:09;"The reason I bring him up is he has directed a good handful of rock videos."
01:21:09;01:21:11;"He's done an LCD Sound System video."
01:21:11;01:21:14;"He's done some MGMT videos."
01:21:14;01:21:16;"Okay, we could probably get this guy on the horn."
01:21:16;01:21:21;"Although, the director did not necessarily come up with the concept."
01:21:21;01:21:23;"It's BBDO who's behind it."
01:21:23;01:21:25;"Oh, that's one of the biggest agencies."

01:21:39;01:21:40;"It's also a little bit Larry."

01:21:46;01:21:49;"going to have a bit about saying New Year's--"

01:22:00;01:22:05;"And we were like, ""There have been brief references to that idea in episodes of Seinfeld and Curb."""
01:22:05;01:22:06;"So we knew."
01:22:06;01:22:08;"It's a preoccupation of Larry's."
01:22:08;01:22:11;"This is the first time he made it a running gag in an episode."
01:22:11;01:22:14;"But there's episodes of both Seinfeld and Curb where somebody says, ""Happy New Year's."""

01:23:13;01:23:15;"There are all sorts of other bowls."
01:23:15;01:23:21;"'93 was the first time they did the huge halftime show extravaganza,"
01:23:21;01:23:22;"and Michael Jackson performed."
01:23:22;01:23:23;"Right."
01:23:23;01:23:25;"Before that, they just have marching bands play and stuff."

01:23:33;01:23:35;"You guys have a bad reputation."
01:23:35;01:23:41;"You got players getting hurt and injured, treated Colin Kaepernick very badly."

01:31:17;01:31:18;"in New York and stuff,"
01:31:18;01:31:20;"just kind of tough guys on a street corner"
01:31:20;01:31:21;"just working on their harmonies."
01:31:21;01:31:22;"Bring it back."
01:31:22;01:31:24;"Complex four- and five-part harmonies."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"Yeah, 'cause you know what?"
01:31:26;01:31:29;"Not to be a dick, but what I don't like as much"
01:31:29;01:31:30;"is acapella culture."
01:31:30;01:31:32;"And I know there's been some great stuff"
01:31:32;01:31:34;"that's come from acapella culture."
01:31:34;01:31:35;"Fully agree."
01:31:35;01:31:36;"But there's just something about it."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"Acapella, it's so collegiate."
01:31:38;01:31:41;"And you know, I can't stand music that started out of college."
01:31:41;01:31:42;"Unacceptable."
01:31:43;01:31:44;"Unacceptable, folks."
01:31:44;01:31:47;"Good music doesn't start in college dorm rooms, okay?"
01:31:47;01:31:49;"It starts on street corners."
01:31:49;01:31:51;"So I'm not that into acapella culture,"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"even though I've met great acapella groups."
01:31:53;01:31:55;"Van Berwigan's performed with some great acapella groups,"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"including at a Bernie Sanders rally four years ago."
01:31:57;01:31:58;"That's right."
01:31:58;01:31:59;"Shout out to them."
01:31:59;01:32:01;"So it's just that acapella culture..."
01:32:01;01:32:03;"Let me get my thoughts straight,"
01:32:03;01:32:07;"because I don't want a whole press nightmare here."
01:32:07;01:32:09;"I like acapella culture at colleges."
01:32:09;01:32:11;"He's repeating on acapella."
01:32:11;01:32:12;"Yeah, just get in."
01:32:12;01:32:14;"I can't even say it."
01:32:14;01:32:16;"Acapella culture."
01:32:16;01:32:17;"Acapella culture."
01:32:17;01:32:19;"Acapella Twitter going nuts."
01:32:19;01:32:20;"Yeah, just, no."
01:32:20;01:32:21;"First of all, acapella..."
01:32:21;01:32:23;"Please acapella Twitter."
01:32:23;01:32:24;"It's nothing but love."
01:32:24;01:32:26;"But I like the idea of acapella"
01:32:26;01:32:29;"as being something that people do at college,"
01:32:29;01:32:30;"because that's cool."
01:32:30;01:32:31;"Get together and sing."
01:32:31;01:32:32;"That's fun."
01:32:32;01:32:34;"I guess what I'm saying is,"
01:32:34;01:32:36;"what we're missing in addition to that,"
01:32:36;01:32:38;"because that's a fun group activity,"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"but doo-wop is something where you just get a gang together"
01:32:40;01:32:41;"and you start it."
01:32:41;01:32:43;"So think about all the people who do acapella in college,"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"and then college is over."
01:32:45;01:32:46;"Well, that's it."
01:32:46;01:32:47;"Maybe you do a reunion every now and then,"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"but you're not part of the institution anymore."
01:32:49;01:32:51;"Those people should be able to..."
01:32:51;01:32:53;"There should be a Tinder or something"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"for people who want to sing together."
01:32:55;01:32:57;"You just graduated from Vassar,"
01:32:57;01:32:59;"and now you move to Chicago,"
01:32:59;01:33:00;"take a job in advertising."
01:33:00;01:33:02;"You used to be in a fun acapella group."
01:33:02;01:33:03;"Now you're all alone in Chicago."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"There should be a Tinder where you open that up"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"and say, ""I'm looking for three other people."
01:33:07;01:33:08;"I sing tenor."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"I need an alto soprano and a kind of bass voice."
01:33:10;01:33:11;"And let's link up,"
01:33:11;01:33:14;"and let's meet on a corner in Lincoln Park."""
01:33:14;01:33:15;"You know what?"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"I'll put out an open casting call right now."
01:33:17;01:33:20;"And I respect what Pentatonix did for the acapella culture."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"They took it out of the colleges,"
01:33:22;01:33:24;"and they took it to the people."
01:33:24;01:33:25;"They're huge."
01:33:25;01:33:26;"They're doing crazy numbers."
01:33:26;01:33:27;"-Hella pro."
01:33:27;01:33:28;"-They're very pro."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"And there's some cool people in Pentatonix."
01:33:30;01:33:33;"But again, that comes from acapella culture."
01:33:33;01:33:34;"That's the Beatles."
01:33:34;01:33:36;"I'm here to pitch a Rolling Stones to that."
01:33:36;01:33:37;"-Right."
01:33:37;01:33:39;"-I'm looking for four tough guys."
01:33:39;01:33:41;"And listen, to start out, rehearsals,"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"I'm sorry, it's going to be on a street corner."
01:33:43;01:33:44;"Because..."
01:33:44;01:33:45;"-Outdoors."
01:33:45;01:33:46;"-It's going to be outdoors."
01:33:46;01:33:47;"-Regardless of temperature."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"[laughter]"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"-I'm looking for four Boston guys."
01:33:51;01:33:53;"Oh, wait, actually, that could work."
01:33:53;01:33:54;"Chris Evans."
01:33:54;01:33:55;"-John Krasinski."
01:33:55;01:33:56;"-Mad Damon."
01:33:56;01:33:57;"No, no, I'm looking for..."
01:33:57;01:33:58;"-Vernon Wahlberg."
01:33:58;01:34:00;"-I'm looking for unknowns."
01:34:00;01:34:02;"I'm looking for four tough guys."
01:34:02;01:34:03;"Maybe we should start in L.A."
01:34:03;01:34:05;"I don't want to be too harsh, but look,"
01:34:05;01:34:06;"you know, sometimes at night in L.A."
01:34:06;01:34:08;"could get down to the 40s."
01:34:08;01:34:09;"Bundle up, fellas."
01:34:09;01:34:11;"-That's the rules of the genre."
01:34:11;01:34:14;"It has to be practiced and written and performed outdoors."
01:34:14;01:34:18;"-And we'll be making the biopic in real time."
01:34:18;01:34:20;"That'll be a great moment for the biopic."
01:34:20;01:34:23;"You know the manager of Bob Marley and Peter Tosh's first band"
01:34:23;01:34:26;"when they were like 13, basically,"
01:34:26;01:34:28;"and he would make them go practice singing all the time?"
01:34:28;01:34:30;"And in the Bob Marley documentary,"
01:34:30;01:34:33;"they tell the story that he made them go sing"
01:34:33;01:34:36;"and perform in the graveyard at night,"
01:34:36;01:34:37;"and they were like scared shitless."
01:34:37;01:34:38;"-Wow."
01:34:38;01:34:40;"-And he was like, ""If you can sing,"""
01:34:40;01:34:42;"I think he used the word ""duppy,"""
01:34:42;01:34:44;"I mean, like, I don't know, I guess ghosts or spirits."
01:34:44;01:34:46;"I'm not totally sure, but he's like,"
01:34:46;01:34:48;"""If you can go sing for the duppies,"
01:34:48;01:34:51;"""and not be scared, you can sing in front of everybody."""
01:34:51;01:34:52;"-I didn't know that backstory."
01:34:52;01:34:56;"It's almost like, what was that movie about the drummer?"
01:34:56;01:34:58;"-I think it's called ""Drumstick."""
01:34:58;01:34:59;"-Whiplash."
01:34:59;01:35:00;"-No, it's called ""Drumstick."""
01:35:00;01:35:03;"-It wasn't ""Whiplash."" I think it's called ""Drumstick."""
01:35:03;01:35:06;"-Yeah, so, like, the bald guy in ""Drumstick"""
01:35:06;01:35:09;"is taking this, like, militaristic approach"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"to Miles Teller, and is just like,"
01:35:11;01:35:12;"""You effing suck!"""
01:35:12;01:35:13;"-Yeah."
01:35:13;01:35:15;"You got to pay your dues."
01:35:15;01:35:17;"Anyway, I'm putting an open call out there."
01:35:17;01:35:20;"That I'm starting, I'll be your manager,"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"and I guess creative director."
01:35:22;01:35:24;"How old should they be? I don't know."
01:35:24;01:35:26;"-Like, 16, 17?"
01:35:26;01:35:27;"-18 to 25."
01:35:27;01:35:28;"-Okay."
01:35:28;01:35:30;"-'Cause I want them to be able to buy cigarettes."
01:35:30;01:35:31;"-Adult."
01:35:31;01:35:32;"-Yeah."
01:35:32;01:35:33;"-Legally adults."
01:35:33;01:35:34;"-I want them to be 18 to 25,"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"'cause I want them to be buying cigarettes a lot."
01:35:36;01:35:38;"[laughs]"
01:35:38;01:35:40;"And that'll be a cool part of, like, the biopic, too,"
01:35:40;01:35:42;"is that I send them to go just, like, make waves"
01:35:42;01:35:45;"at an a cappella conference or a competition,"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"and everybody's like, ""Who are these guys?"""
01:35:47;01:35:50;"And then they just go up there and, like, blow some minds."
01:35:50;01:35:52;"-They crush with original material."
01:35:52;01:35:53;"-And we're doing originals."
01:35:53;01:35:54;"-Yeah."
01:35:54;01:35:55;"-And there's gonna be a lot of"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"""Bing, bing, bang, ba-dime, ba-dime, boom, ba-dime."""
01:35:57;01:36:00;"We're gonna use the language of old doo-wop."
01:36:00;01:36:03;"And also, first of all, doo-wop is--"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"it doesn't have to be a cappella, of course,"
01:36:05;01:36:08;"and often it wasn't, at least on-- it recorded,"
01:36:08;01:36:10;"but you could take it a lot of different places,"
01:36:10;01:36:13;"'cause, I don't know, they were a doo-wop vocal group,"
01:36:13;01:36:17;"but the Tokens who did ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight."""
01:36:17;01:36:18;"-Oh, my God."
01:36:18;01:36:19;"-He-he!"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"You got the guy with the really high voice."
01:36:21;01:36:24;"You got the-- you know, also, like, people love Jersey Boys."
01:36:24;01:36:27;"Those guys basically come from the doo-wop tradition."
01:36:27;01:36:28;"-Sure."
01:36:28;01:36:30;"-Tough Italian guys from Jersey."
01:36:30;01:36:31;"-And also-- and then--"
01:36:31;01:36:32;"-Maybe I gotta go-- this would be a good reason"
01:36:32;01:36:34;"for me to get back to Jersey more often."
01:36:34;01:36:36;"-Well, dude, this is a full tri-state tie-in,"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"because then you got the Billy Joel record,"
01:36:38;01:36:40;"where it's like a full doo-wop/Four Seasons,"
01:36:40;01:36:42;"like, tribute record."
01:36:42;01:36:43;"-Yeah, you know?"
01:36:43;01:36:44;"-But it's all originals."
01:36:44;01:36:45;"-This could be big."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"I'm gonna get--"
01:36:46;01:36:47;"-Dude, next vampire?"
01:36:47;01:36:48;"-Maybe."
01:36:48;01:36:49;"Well, you know what it is--"
01:36:49;01:36:50;"-That would be the least cool thing,"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"but I'd be so on board."
01:36:52;01:36:55;"-♫ What else could I do? ♫"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"♫ I'm so inspired by-- ♫"
01:36:57;01:36:58;"No, this is separate."
01:36:58;01:36:59;"I might-- you know, I might--"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"I might-- I might get these guys on a track"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"on the new record, just to get, you know--"
01:37:03;01:37:04;"-Yeah."
01:37:04;01:37:05;"-Just to get their name out there,"
01:37:05;01:37:06;"but no, I'm gonna do my thing."
01:37:06;01:37:07;"-Yeah."
01:37:07;01:37:09;"-I wanna find four Jersey Boys."
01:37:09;01:37:11;"Maybe we'll call them the New Jersey Boys."
01:37:11;01:37:12;"It's kind of a plan of ours."
01:37:12;01:37:14;"-How has that not been a band already?"
01:37:14;01:37:16;"The New Jersey Boys."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"-The New Jersey Boys."
01:37:17;01:37:19;"You know what, I'm gonna make them practice"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"out in front of a dunk of donuts."
01:37:21;01:37:23;"They gotta put a Yankees hat out"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"to ask for change,"
01:37:25;01:37:27;"and then that'll be, like, the story."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"It'll just be like--"
01:37:28;01:37:29;"-We were busking for donut holes."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"-Yeah, oh, God, that's such, like,"
01:37:31;01:37:33;"a corny part of, like, a biopic."
01:37:33;01:37:36;"Just like, ""Uh, Mr. Koenig, you know,"
01:37:36;01:37:37;"we're kind of hungry."
01:37:37;01:37:38;"You mind buying us a few donuts?"""
01:37:38;01:37:41;"And I'll say, ""Fellas, you sing, then you eat."
01:37:41;01:37:43;"I'm not buying the donuts."
01:37:43;01:37:44;"Sing for your donuts."""
01:37:44;01:37:46;"[laughter]"
01:37:46;01:37:48;"All right, New Jersey Boys."
01:37:48;01:37:50;"-That's the name of the memoir they write."
01:37:50;01:37:52;"-Sing for your donuts."
01:37:52;01:37:53;"[laughter]"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"All right, New Jersey Boys, but seriously,"
01:37:55;01:37:56;"if there's any TC heads,"
01:37:56;01:37:59;"I'm looking for four tough Jersey motherf---ers"
01:37:59;01:38:00;"with the voice of an angel."
01:38:00;01:38:04;"All right, back to 1967,"
01:38:04;01:38:06;"we got Snoopy versus the Red Baron."
01:38:06;01:38:08;"-What the hell is this?"
01:38:08;01:38:10;"-This is a novelty record, as I recall."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"-Do you know this one?"
01:38:11;01:38:12;"-I'm vaguely familiar."
01:38:12;01:38:13;"I think this is a novelty record"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"that's Snoopy versus the Red Baron."
01:38:15;01:38:17;"I've never fully understood why Snoopy--"
01:38:17;01:38:20;"I think in the Peanuts, Snoopy would often have--"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"Snoopy's the dog."
01:38:22;01:38:23;"-Yeah."
01:38:23;01:38:24;"-He walks upright."
01:38:24;01:38:26;"He's kind of a humanoid dog."
01:38:26;01:38:27;"And I think Snoopy would often have--"
01:38:27;01:38:28;"-Terrifying."
01:38:28;01:38:29;"[laughter]"
01:38:29;01:38:32;"-I think Snoopy would often have flights of fancy."
01:38:32;01:38:33;"'Cause obviously--"
01:38:33;01:38:34;"-Is it literally about Snoopy?"
01:38:34;01:38:35;"-Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it was--"
01:38:35;01:38:36;"-This isn't a joke?"
01:38:36;01:38:37;"-It was him versus the Red Baron,"
01:38:37;01:38:39;"like a World War I German ace."
01:38:39;01:38:40;"-Like a fighter pilot."
01:38:40;01:38:41;"-Yeah, like a fighter pilot."
01:38:41;01:38:43;"Because I think, if you picture the world of Peanuts--"
01:38:43;01:38:44;"-Jesus."
01:38:44;01:38:46;"-Was a very kind of mundane, quiet, suburban--"
01:38:46;01:38:47;"-Yeah."
01:38:47;01:38:50;"-Melancholic existence, just Charlie Brown being like,"
01:38:50;01:38:51;"""What's going on?"""
01:38:51;01:38:52;"But then--"
01:38:52;01:38:53;"-Just a sad ennui."
01:38:53;01:38:54;"-I think they would spice things up"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"by letting Snoopy would have a dream"
01:38:56;01:38:58;"where next thing you know, he's just out there,"
01:38:58;01:39:02;"just 30 confirmed kills during the campaign."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"[laughter]"
01:39:04;01:39:07;"-Anyway, so this is--"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"This is a novelty record about--"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"-After the turn of the century"
01:39:11;01:39:14;"In the clear blue skies over Germany"
01:39:14;01:39:15;"-Sounds like the Beach Boys."
01:39:15;01:39:16;"-Yeah."
01:39:16;01:39:17;"-Is it like--"
01:39:17;01:39:18;"Sounds like Mike Love singing."
01:39:18;01:39:19;"-Game of Road and Thunderman"
01:39:19;01:39:20;"Have never heard"
01:39:20;01:39:23;"Like the screaming sound of a big war bird"
01:39:23;01:39:27;"Up in the sky, a man in a plane"
01:39:27;01:39:31;"Baron von Richthofen was his name"
01:39:31;01:39:34;"He tried and 80 men died"
01:39:34;01:39:38;"Now they're buried together on the countryside"
01:39:38;01:39:42;"10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or more"
01:39:42;01:39:43;"-Confirmed kills, man."
01:39:43;01:39:45;"-Oh, he's talking about his confirmed kills, yeah."
01:39:45;01:39:47;"-And he's just racking them up."
01:39:47;01:39:49;"-Dude, American sniper."
01:39:49;01:39:51;"-This song can be heard towards the end"
01:39:51;01:39:53;"of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."
01:39:53;01:39:54;"-Oh, that's perfect."
01:39:54;01:39:55;"-Perfect."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"Also, just imagine, this is 1967."
01:39:57;01:40:00;"There are 100% dudes in Vietnam"
01:40:00;01:40:01;"hearing this on like the"
01:40:01;01:40:03;"Good Morning Vietnam radio station."
01:40:03;01:40:04;"-Nuts."
01:40:04;01:40:06;"-These guys are like a novelty group"
01:40:06;01:40:07;"called the Royal Guardsmen"
01:40:07;01:40:08;"and they went on to record"
01:40:08;01:40:11;"several other Snoopy theme songs including--"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"-Ooh."
01:40:13;01:40:14;"I mean, it's not that bad."
01:40:14;01:40:15;"-No, it's good music."
01:40:15;01:40:17;"-If they had written like different lyrics,"
01:40:17;01:40:19;"it just would have been a band."
01:40:19;01:40:22;"-But they record other Snoopy songs including"
01:40:22;01:40:25;"The Return of the Red Baron and Snoopy's Christmas."
01:40:25;01:40:29;"In 2006, they reunited and released"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"[laughter]"
01:40:31;01:40:33;"-What?"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"-In 2006, these guys reunited"
01:40:35;01:40:39;"and released Snoopy vs. Osama."
01:40:39;01:40:40;"[laughter]"
01:40:40;01:40:41;"That's what it says."
01:40:41;01:40:43;"We got--oh, God."
01:40:43;01:40:44;"We got to look this up."
01:40:44;01:40:46;"Oh, my God."
01:40:46;01:40:49;"-That's a reunion that no one was asking for."
01:40:49;01:40:52;"-Snoopy vs. Osama."
01:40:54;01:40:56;"Jesus Christ."
01:40:56;01:40:57;"-Nice."
01:40:57;01:40:59;"-Oh, my God."
01:41:10;01:41:13;"Oh."
01:41:13;01:41:16;"Truly a tasteless palate on every level."
01:41:24;01:41:28;"In a real bad land."
01:41:28;01:41:32;"Shame on you, rail guardsmen."
01:41:37;01:41:39;"[laughter]"
01:41:39;01:41:43;"Oh, God."
01:41:43;01:41:47;"This is like weirdo outsider art at this point."
01:41:47;01:41:49;"[laughter]"
01:41:51;01:41:55;"This is like that dude--what's his name?"
01:41:55;01:41:57;"Matt something Noakes who did the Tower--"
01:41:57;01:41:58;"-Oh, Martin Noakes."
01:41:58;01:42:00;"-Martin Noakes who did the Tower 7 song."
01:42:00;01:42:01;"-Martin Noakes is far more talented."
01:42:01;01:42:02;"Oh, by the way--"
01:42:02;01:42:03;"-I agree."
01:42:03;01:42:04;"-We forgot we were going to get Martin Noakes on the show."
01:42:04;01:42:05;"-I was like, ""Did we do that?"""
01:42:05;01:42:06;"-No, no, we're going to do it."
01:42:06;01:42:08;"That's a good reminder to get Martin on the show."
01:42:08;01:42:10;"-Holy Christ."
01:42:10;01:42:14;"-I mean, guys, just--so just imagine."
01:42:14;01:42:16;"It's 2006, five years after--"
01:42:16;01:42:18;"-That's like the best thing I've heard in a long time."
01:42:18;01:42:21;"-Five years after 9/11 and these guys are just like,"
01:42:21;01:42:24;"""Guys, America needs us."
01:42:24;01:42:28;"We need another flight of fancy in which Snoopy,"
01:42:28;01:42:32;"the cartoon dog, murders the enemies of America."""
01:42:32;01:42:35;"Also, just like the lyrics, ""In a real bad land,"""
01:42:35;01:42:37;"just like--and also opening with like the--"
01:42:37;01:42:38;"-Oh, yeah."
01:42:38;01:42:40;"-It's like super Islamophobic."
01:42:40;01:42:44;"Royal Guardsmen, shame on you."
01:42:44;01:42:46;"Back to '93."
01:42:46;01:42:50;"-Wow, very--in '93, very soundtrack heavy."
01:42:50;01:42:52;"So far, everything's been on a soundtrack."
01:42:52;01:42:53;"-Bodyguard?"
01:42:53;01:42:56;"-No, Aladdin, A Whole New World."
01:42:56;01:42:59;"It's been all kind of '90s, vaguely R&B power ballads."
01:42:59;01:43:01;"-Is this David Foster?"
01:43:01;01:43:02;"It's got that palette."
01:43:02;01:43:04;"-Tim Rice."
01:43:04;01:43:08;"-I can show you the world"
01:43:08;01:43:12;"Shining, shimmering, splendid"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"-What is this?"
01:43:14;01:43:15;"-That was real deep."
01:43:15;01:43:17;"-Did you see Aladdin when it came out, or were you too old?"
01:43:17;01:43:22;"-I think I was too old. I was 16."
01:43:22;01:43:25;"-This is where the days between really comes into effect,"
01:43:25;01:43:26;"is in the early '90s."
01:43:26;01:43:28;"-You saw it?"
01:43:28;01:43:32;"-You were 16, and I was 9?"
01:43:32;01:43:34;"-Yeah."
01:43:34;01:43:36;"-Or you were like 17-ish."
01:43:36;01:43:38;"-93, I would have been 16, yeah."
01:43:38;01:43:41;"-It's also funny that this is like the grown-up version of it."
01:43:41;01:43:44;"You know, like also Elton John doing the great songs"
01:43:44;01:43:46;"from The Lion King, those are crossover pop hits."
01:43:46;01:43:48;"-I did see The Lion King in the theater."
01:43:48;01:43:49;"-Good film."
01:43:49;01:43:51;"But you know, Elton John, that's a song,"
01:43:51;01:43:53;"even if you didn't see The Lion King,"
01:43:53;01:43:56;"the lyrics to, what's the big Lion King song?"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"-Can you feel it?"
01:43:58;01:43:59;"-Is that the one?"
01:43:59;01:44:00;"-Yeah, yeah."
01:44:00;01:44:01;"-Okay, it is."
01:44:01;01:44:03;"-That's one of the big ones, and that was a pop crossover"
01:44:03;01:44:06;"because that doesn't really reference the movie much."
01:44:06;01:44:10;"He does use the word vagabond, which is the funny word choice."
01:44:10;01:44:14;"It's enough to make kings and vagabonds."
01:44:14;01:44:16;"-That's pretty on-brand for Bernie Taupin."
01:44:16;01:44:17;"-Yeah, that's pretty on-brand."
01:44:17;01:44:19;"I don't think he wrote those lyrics, but sure."
01:44:19;01:44:21;"It's not a weird Elton John thing."
01:44:21;01:44:24;"-I like that you know that Taupin didn't write the stuff on Lion King, dude."
01:44:24;01:44:28;"-I think he linked up with Tim Rice again or something like that."
01:44:28;01:44:30;"But in this song, A Whole New World,"
01:44:30;01:44:33;"you don't need to see the movie to relate to it."
01:44:33;01:44:35;"A Whole New World, that could be a pop song."
01:44:35;01:44:37;"-Is this the one that goes, ""A whole new world?"""
01:44:37;01:44:41;"-Yeah, ""Don't you dare close your eyes, a new fantastic--"""
01:44:41;01:44:42;"Yeah, I know the song very well."
01:44:42;01:44:44;"I'm the right age to know the song very well."
01:44:44;01:44:45;"-Let's get to the chorus."
01:44:45;01:44:48;"-But anyway, I just wanted to point out that that part always--"
01:44:48;01:44:51;"In the movie, Aladdin is literally talking to Princess Jasmine."
01:44:51;01:44:53;"So when he says, ""Tell me, princess,"""
01:44:53;01:44:56;"he's literally just saying the character's name, Princess."
01:44:56;01:44:58;"There's always something funny to me being a kid"
01:44:58;01:45:00;"when I would hear the grown folks version on the radio,"
01:45:00;01:45:03;"and Peebo Bryson goes, ""Tell me, princess."""
01:45:03;01:45:11;"[singing]"
01:45:11;01:45:13;"I remember hearing that on the radio as a kid"
01:45:13;01:45:15;"and being like, ""This is weird."""
01:45:15;01:45:32;"[singing]"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"Magic carpet ride, bro."
01:45:34;01:45:38;"[singing]"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"Great singer, though."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"It's a good hook, that chorus."
01:45:42;01:46:04;"[singing]"
01:46:04;01:46:08;"This early '90s R&B pop ballad aesthetic,"
01:46:08;01:46:11;"I'm finding pretty tasteful right now."
01:46:11;01:46:13;"I could see Bon Iver going in this direction."
01:46:13;01:46:15;"Oh, yeah, that'd be sick."
01:46:15;01:46:35;"[singing]"
01:46:35;01:46:37;"This is a beautiful song."
01:46:37;01:46:38;"I'm really feeling it."
01:46:38;01:46:40;"This is the song so far we've heard by a mile."
01:46:40;01:46:43;"[singing]"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"The harp, yeah, gorgeous."
01:46:45;01:46:48;"[singing]"
01:46:48;01:46:50;"Wait, wait, time was our hoax."
01:46:50;01:47:03;"[singing]"
01:47:03;01:47:04;"Nice."
01:47:04;01:47:06;"[laughing]"
01:47:06;01:47:07;"Great tone."
01:47:07;01:47:08;"[laughing]"
01:47:08;01:47:11;"Not the most tasteful guitar tone, but..."
01:47:11;01:47:13;"Trans-Siberian orchestra vibes."
01:47:13;01:47:16;"Couldn't this be like a sick David Bowie song?"
01:47:16;01:47:17;"Oh, yeah."
01:47:17;01:47:20;"[singing]"
01:47:20;01:47:23;"[laughing]"
01:47:23;01:47:25;"Like something of Ziggy Stardust."
01:47:25;01:47:26;"Yeah."
01:47:26;01:47:28;"Queen featuring David Bowie."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"For sure."
01:47:29;01:47:30;"Oh, yeah."
01:47:30;01:47:32;"Just Bowie and Freddie Mercury going head-to-head on this."
01:47:32;01:47:33;"That would've been sick."
01:47:33;01:47:35;"Do you think they sang that live together?"
01:47:35;01:47:38;"It sounds to me like they did, but..."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"That's just a convincing performance."
01:47:40;01:47:41;"Right."
01:47:41;01:47:46;"I was picturing them, like, both with headphones, like, in the studio singing together."
01:47:46;01:47:48;"Who is this singing?"
01:47:48;01:47:50;"Peebo Bryson and Regina Bell."
01:47:50;01:47:54;"This would go on to win Grammy for Song of the Year."
01:47:54;01:47:55;"Well, that's tight."
01:47:55;01:47:57;"And it won the Academy Award for Best Original Song."
01:47:57;01:47:59;"That's like a shallow moment."
01:47:59;01:48:01;"Cleaning up at the Grammys and the Oscars."
01:48:01;01:48:02;"Hell, yeah."
01:48:02;01:48:09;"Zayn Malik and Javi Award recorded a new version for the 2019 remake of Aladdin."
01:48:09;01:48:11;"Did you see the remake of Aladdin?"
01:48:11;01:48:12;"No."
01:48:12;01:48:13;"Did you?"
01:48:13;01:48:14;"No."
01:48:14;01:48:16;"Seemed disrespectful to the cartoon."
01:48:16;01:48:17;"Was it live action?"
01:48:17;01:48:18;"It was live action, but..."
01:48:18;01:48:21;"Who wants to see a live action Aladdin?"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"Apparently, a lot of people."
01:48:23;01:48:24;"Was it a global smash?"
01:48:24;01:48:29;"It was a global smash, but I think all these movies do pretty well because the parents are nostalgic for it."
01:48:29;01:48:30;"Right."
01:48:30;01:48:33;"And they're like, ""Oh, man, now I get to share this with my kids."
01:48:33;01:48:38;"I get to share the slightly more disturbing live action version of The Lion King with my kids."""
01:48:38;01:48:39;"Oh, right."
01:48:39;01:48:41;"They did the weird live action scene."
01:48:41;01:48:42;"Well, hold on."
01:48:42;01:48:45;"Let's see how the Zayn and Javi Award hits."
01:48:45;01:48:51;"Wait, is Zayn from One Direction?"
01:48:51;01:48:52;"Formally, yes."
01:48:52;01:48:53;"Okay."
01:48:53;01:48:54;"Look at me."
01:48:59;01:49:00;"Zayn got that TC bump."
01:49:00;01:49:01;"Yeah."
01:49:01;01:49:03;"I'd bring a little more Middle Eastern flavor to it."
01:49:03;01:49:07;"He's like real laid back."
01:49:07;01:49:09;"Yeah, it's not the right vibe for the song."
01:49:09;01:49:13;"This is not bad, but I mean..."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"He needs to be emphatic about it, dude."
01:49:15;01:49:16;"Look, no..."
01:49:16;01:49:18;"I can open your eyes."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"Nobody should have to compete with Peebo Bryson."
01:49:20;01:49:22;"That guy sings his ass off."
01:49:22;01:49:26;"Back to '67, the number two song, Georgie Girl."
01:49:26;01:49:27;"I know this song."
01:49:27;01:49:29;"By the Seekers?"
01:49:29;01:49:30;"Yeah."
01:49:30;01:49:34;"""Hey there, Georgie girl, walking down the street so fancy free."""
01:49:34;01:49:36;"This is from a movie..."
01:49:36;01:49:38;"A lot of movie songs from a movie called Georgie Girl."
01:49:38;01:49:42;"I've never seen the film, but this always seemed like a fun song."
01:49:42;01:49:44;"And also, they're from Australia."
01:49:44;01:49:47;"This is probably one of the very early hits for Australians."
01:49:55;01:49:57;"This song also reminds me..."
01:49:57;01:50:01;"It's not on it, but it's very similar to songs on the Rushmore soundtrack."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"Oh, sure."
01:50:02;01:50:04;"Could totally see that."
01:50:04;01:50:19;"Could totally hear this deep background on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, too."
01:50:19;01:50:20;"Oh, yeah."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"I mean, probably everything on this top five."
01:50:22;01:50:24;"""Hey, Cliff, uh..."""
01:50:24;01:50:25;"Yeah."
01:50:25;01:50:29;"Just a great '60s pop song."
01:50:29;01:50:34;"Back to '93, ""If I Ever Fall in Love."""
01:50:34;01:50:36;"Now we got a remix here."
01:50:36;01:50:41;"So this is ""Shy,"" ""If I Ever Fall in Love."""
01:50:41;01:50:44;"Nothing but slow jams this week in '93."
01:50:44;01:50:45;"Very mellow week."
01:50:45;01:50:47;"[laughs]"

01:51:04;01:51:12;"It's cool."
01:51:12;01:51:13;"Cool production."
01:51:13;01:51:14;"Spooky."
01:51:15;01:51:17;"[sings]"
01:51:17;01:51:20;"His lead vocal is kind of mixed low."

01:51:51;01:51:52;"That's kind of sick."
01:51:52;01:51:53;"That's a great..."
01:51:53;01:51:57;"Also, that reminds me of Dirty Projector's ""Gun Has No Trigger."""
01:51:57;01:51:58;"Oh, yeah."
01:51:58;01:51:59;"Totally, dude."
01:51:59;01:52:01;"I mean, that's like a common chord change, but..."
01:52:01;01:52:04;"This song's cool as hell."
01:52:04;01:52:05;"Yeah, I'm in."
01:52:05;01:52:08;"The number one song back in '67."
01:52:08;01:52:11;"This one needs no introduction."
01:52:11;01:52:14;"""The Monkees."""
01:52:20;01:52:22;"Now this is no re-record."
01:52:22;01:52:23;"Yeah."
01:52:23;01:52:28;"Also, so ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."""
01:52:28;01:52:29;"Oh, yeah."
01:52:29;01:52:46;"It's funny, I think about Tarantino editing the movie and trying out different songs."
01:52:46;01:52:47;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:52:47;01:52:49;"Like, ""Oh, it's Brad Pitt with 'Drunk Driving Home.'"""
01:52:49;01:52:51;"Like, ""Let's try this 'Monkees' song."""
01:52:51;01:52:53;"This has like hundreds and hundreds of them."
01:52:53;01:53:03;"Did you grow up watching reruns of ""The Monkees""?"
01:53:03;01:53:05;"Yeah, I did a little bit."
01:53:05;01:53:08;"I don't really remember the show very well, but..."
01:53:08;01:53:13;"This is also a great song in that the music helps tell the story of the lyrics."
01:53:13;01:53:16;"Like, the verses are just like, ""I don't know, man. I don't really believe in love."
01:53:16;01:53:19;"I'm kind of dejected and I'm singing down low."""
01:53:19;01:53:20;"And then it's like..."
01:53:20;01:53:26;"Yeah."
01:53:26;01:53:28;"The organ represents the love."
01:53:28;01:53:29;"Yeah."
01:53:29;01:53:31;"Sick."
01:53:31;01:53:32;"Great song."
01:53:32;01:53:36;"Of course, this was a little cover by Smash Mouth for the Shrek soundtrack."
01:53:36;01:53:40;"And then Weezer would cover it for another Shrek movie, ""Shrek Forever After."""
01:53:40;01:53:44;"And I believe I've told the story on this show about how they reached out to Vampire Weekend"
01:53:44;01:53:46;"about covering this song for..."
01:53:46;01:53:47;"Covering this song?"
01:53:47;01:53:49;"I can't even remember the story anymore."
01:53:49;01:53:52;"It was something about somebody from Shrek asked us if we would do a song,"
01:53:52;01:53:55;"but it was partially because Weezer had just been in a bus accident."
01:53:55;01:53:56;"Uh-huh."
01:53:56;01:54:00;"Somehow it was made clear to us that because Weezer was unavailable, they like..."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"Nick just pulled out..."
01:54:02;01:54:05;"I know I told this story because Nick just pulled up an article."
01:54:05;01:54:08;"""Vampire Weekend didn't appear on Shrek soundtrack because"
01:54:08;01:54:12;"Ezra Koenig refused to capitalize on Weezer's misfortune."""
01:54:12;01:54:14;"Is that from a TC story?"
01:54:14;01:54:16;"No, this is... I think I said it on Twitter."
01:54:16;01:54:19;"I'm also confused. They're asking..."
01:54:19;01:54:20;"Okay, here..."
01:54:20;01:54:22;"...bands to cover the same song multiple times?"
01:54:22;01:54:24;"Yeah, you know, it's like on a TV show."
01:54:24;01:54:27;"Every season they get somebody new to do the song kind of thing."
01:54:27;01:54:28;"Okay."
01:54:28;01:54:30;"I f***ing wrote this article because they had my back."
01:54:30;01:54:32;"James Grabe."
01:54:32;01:54:33;"I'm sorry, I don't know how to pronounce your name."
01:54:33;01:54:35;"James Grabe."
01:54:35;01:54:36;"Grabe."
01:54:36;01:54:38;"He told the story like it is."
01:54:38;01:54:44;"So he talks about how Weezer were scheduled to contribute a cover of ""I'm a Believer"" to the 2010 film."
01:54:44;01:54:47;"Right, the timing makes total sense. Shrek ever after."
01:54:47;01:54:50;"But it looked like they weren't going to be able to make it following a bus accident."
01:54:50;01:54:53;"The soundtrack supervisor turned to Vampire Weekend to fill in,"
01:54:53;01:54:57;"but Koenig declined saying he refused to capitalize on Weezer's misfortune."
01:54:57;01:55:00;"Weezer were ultimately able to record the track and Koenig made the right choice,"
01:55:00;01:55:01;"but it was a hard choice to make indeed."
01:55:01;01:55:04;"""Do I sometimes regret the decision? Of course,"" he tweeted."
01:55:04;01:55:08;"""Do I sometimes lie on Twitter and say I was on Shrek soundtracks? Yes, once."""
01:55:08;01:55:13;"That's how it all started, is because somebody asked me if we'd ever been on a Shrek soundtrack,"
01:55:13;01:55:15;"and I said, ""Yes."""
01:55:15;01:55:18;"And then I actually told the real story about how we almost were."
01:55:18;01:55:19;"Deep."
01:55:19;01:55:21;"We're hoping to get Smash Mouth on the show, actually."
01:55:21;01:55:23;"We got so many questions for them."
01:55:23;01:55:27;"I was just painting a picture for us, that early '90s San Jose scene."
01:55:27;01:55:29;"I mean, that'll be a hell of an episode if we actually get them."
01:55:29;01:55:33;"Anyway, ""I'm a Believer,"" great song."
01:55:33;01:55:36;"This has been a great top five on both sides."
01:55:36;01:55:40;"It's a little more upbeat from the '67, but '93, just some killer ballads."
01:55:40;01:55:42;"Kind of deeper ballads."
01:55:42;01:55:44;"And you're not going to believe what's number one."
01:55:44;01:55:48;"So far we've been talking, we've had a lot of these killer ballads from movie soundtracks."
01:55:48;01:55:51;"Guess what's number one, '93? Maybe the ultimate."
01:55:51;01:55:53;"Oh, Whitney Houston?"
01:55:53;01:56:00;"You know, you weren't here at that time when Justin from Boney Ver came,"
01:56:00;01:56:03;"and we talked about this song, and this song meant a lot to him, too."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"He had a very deep emotional connection to it."
01:56:05;01:56:08;"And he probably knew the Whitney version first."
01:56:08;01:56:10;"I think so, yeah."
01:56:10;01:56:16;"Yeah, he had a really deep story."
01:56:16;01:56:20;"I think they had a cassette of it, maybe somebody's grandpa died or something,"
01:56:20;01:56:21;"and he's listening to it a lot."
01:56:21;01:56:22;"Wow."
01:56:22;01:56:29;"Dude, I was listening to this Dolly Parton podcast that kind of was a hit, I think, in the last few months."
01:56:29;01:56:33;"And she was telling the story of this song when she was leaving."
01:56:33;01:56:34;"When she wrote this?"
01:56:34;01:56:40;"Yeah, she was leaving the Porter Wagoner television show, which had made her a huge star."
01:56:40;01:56:48;"And he got crappy with her, very possessive, and was like, ""You're leaving? I made you, how can you leave?"""
01:56:48;01:56:51;"And she's like, ""I have to leave, the vibe's not there anymore."""
01:56:51;01:56:55;"And so she played this song for him in his office."
01:56:55;01:56:57;"That was the story she told."
01:56:57;01:57:00;"And this was her goodbye song, like, ""Listen, I'll always love you."""
01:57:00;01:57:02;"Really? And I wonder how he reacted."
01:57:02;01:57:06;"Was he just like, ""Okay, whatever, like I said, f*** you."""
01:57:06;01:57:09;"Yeah. ""I'll have my lawyer call you."""
01:57:09;01:57:11;"Songs don't always hit the same way the first time."
01:57:11;01:57:12;"Sure."
01:57:12;01:57:15;"I think they were estranged, okay, I'm trying to remember the episode."
01:57:15;01:57:19;"They were estranged for decades, and then I think they had a deathbed reunion."
01:57:19;01:57:20;"Wow."
01:57:20;01:57:22;"Where they kind of made it okay."
01:57:22;01:57:26;"But I got kind of choked up, I was in the car listening to this, and I was like..."
01:57:26;01:57:30;"I mean, this is such an emotional song. Beautiful song."
01:57:30;01:57:35;"Now, because he's been gone for such a long time, and we almost got him this time,"
01:57:35;01:57:38;"but between being out of the country and being very busy,"
01:57:38;01:57:41;"we've been very sad to not have Seinfeld here,"
01:57:41;01:57:43;"although Nick's done a great job crunching the numbers."
01:57:43;01:57:46;"We're going to do a quick check-in with Seinfeld, just to cap off this episode."
01:57:46;01:57:47;"Sweet. Great."
01:57:47;01:57:51;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:57:51;01:57:55;"Hey, what's up?"
01:57:55;01:57:58;"Seinfeld. Listen to that energy, man."
01:57:58;01:57:59;"You're raring to go."
01:57:59;01:58:01;"What's going on? I miss you guys."
01:58:01;01:58:02;"Where the hell you been, man?"
01:58:02;01:58:03;"Miss you, man."
01:58:03;01:58:05;"Yeah, well, don't worry about where I've been."
01:58:05;01:58:09;"I bet you've been out crunching numbers for some other internet radio shows."
01:58:09;01:58:13;"Oh, I would never-- I mean, I've been crunching numbers for myself personally,"
01:58:13;01:58:17;"but, you know, it's just part of my life."
01:58:17;01:58:22;"All right, well, look, we don't want to give any of your crazy fans too much info."
01:58:22;01:58:25;"We want to protect your privacy, but can you at least tell the Crisis Crew,"
01:58:25;01:58:28;"are you in the continental United States?"
01:58:28;01:58:30;"I'm in the USA."
01:58:30;01:58:33;"Okay. So now we're getting somewhere."
01:58:33;01:58:34;"Yeah."
01:58:34;01:58:37;"We have to keep him on the phone for another 30 seconds,"
01:58:37;01:58:41;"so that we can fully pinpoint his location."
01:58:41;01:58:48;"Anyway, so Seinfeld, have you been watching the new Curb Your Enthusiasms?"
01:58:48;01:58:51;"Yeah, did you say Enthusiasms?"
01:58:51;01:58:53;"That's multiple episodes now. It's two at least."
01:58:53;01:58:55;"Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:58:55;01:58:58;"Yeah, I've been checking it out, and I've actually-- for the listeners,"
01:58:58;01:59:04;"I've prepared a special report recapping what's been happening so far."
01:59:04;01:59:05;"On Curb?"
01:59:05;01:59:06;"Yeah."
01:59:06;01:59:09;"Great. All right. Episode recap. Here we go."
01:59:09;01:59:10;"Let's get into it."
01:59:10;01:59:12;"All right."
01:59:12;01:59:16;"It's official. Seinfeld co-creator and friend of the show,"
01:59:16;01:59:21;"Kazzy David's dad, Larry David, and his usual gang of comedy misfits are back"
01:59:21;01:59:26;"with season 10 of the hit HBO comedy, Curb Your Enthusiasm."
01:59:26;01:59:28;"And this time, he's playing for keeps."
01:59:28;01:59:31;"Okay. Are you reading something?"
01:59:31;01:59:32;"You prepared it."
01:59:32;01:59:33;"Yeah."
01:59:33;01:59:34;"Is that all you got?"
01:59:34;01:59:38;"No, no, no. I've got a little bit more."
01:59:38;01:59:42;"And Jake, I'd appreciate it if you don't interrupt my flow."
01:59:42;01:59:46;"This Super Bowl Sunday might be the big game,"
01:59:46;01:59:51;"but the biggest tackles will be coming in after the final touchdown on Curb,"
01:59:51;01:59:56;"where Larry David will be tackling some of the hot button issues of our time."
01:59:56;02:00:00;"Those buttons are so hot, you're going to need some Neosporin for your fingers"
02:00:00;02:00:06;"because of the third-degree burns from those hot buttons."
02:00:06;02:00:10;"Larry is declaring war on MAGA hats, the #MeToo movement,"
02:00:10;02:00:13;"and also not to mention even the coffee industry."
02:00:13;02:00:19;"As they say in the movie 1917, when it comes to war, laughter is the best medicine."
02:00:19;02:00:27;"Paging Dr. Larry, we're going to need three cc's of comedy to the ICU. Stat."
02:00:27;02:00:30;"I have a feeling that Seinfeld might have gotten a job at HBO"
02:00:30;02:00:34;"because that level of work would only be somebody who's actually been professionally--"
02:00:34;02:00:37;"Yeah, there's a professional sheen to this copy."
02:00:37;02:00:39;"Not to the performance, but the copy."
02:00:39;02:00:40;"Yeah."
02:00:40;02:00:44;"But the copy that's not characteristic of TC."
02:00:44;02:00:47;"You need to write this kind of stuff for TC because, again,"
02:00:47;02:00:53;"when an average TC head goes up to a civilian and they're trying to describe,"
02:00:53;02:00:55;"""You've got to check out this internet radio show,"" first of all, they're already like,"
02:00:55;02:00:58;"""What do you mean? A podcast?"" ""No, it's an internet radio show."""
02:00:58;02:01:01;"""Well, what's it about?"" ""I mean, these guys are talking about corporate food culture, grateful--"""
02:01:01;02:01:08;"""What? What are the--? What? Well, it's Ezra and Jake, man. It's a painter, American painter."""
02:01:08;02:01:11;"""No, it's a mess. You try to get somebody into the show, it's a mess."""
02:01:11;02:01:13;"You need to do this kind of--"
02:01:13;02:01:14;"Impenetrable mess."
02:01:14;02:01:15;"It's an impenetrable mess."
02:01:15;02:01:21;"You need to create this kind of slick language so that maybe we even start printing it on cards."
02:01:21;02:01:23;"We could send this out to members of the crisis crew."
02:01:23;02:01:26;"The next time they want to describe it, they don't have to be grasping and be like,"
02:01:26;02:01:28;"""Oh, well, then they were talking about--"""
02:01:28;02:01:29;"Okay."
02:01:29;02:01:33;"""Wayne, Houston."" It's going to be something that was written by our in-house--"
02:01:33;02:01:34;"our head of marketing--"
02:01:34;02:01:35;"Copywriter."
02:01:35;02:01:38;"Our copywriter, Seinfeld 2000, that says something like--"
02:01:38;02:01:39;"You know what I mean?"
02:01:39;02:01:48;"Okay. Yeah, I got to say, I put a lot of effort into making this report on Curb Your Enthusiasm informative,"
02:01:48;02:01:50;"but also feel natural."
02:01:50;02:01:59;"And I feel like it's sort of inspired a lot of running commentary on both my report itself,"
02:01:59;02:02:06;"my role in the show, and the future as far as bringing cards into things."
02:02:06;02:02:10;"I don't really appreciate it."
02:02:10;02:02:13;"I'm a big fan of the show."
02:02:13;02:02:15;"This came from the heart, what I prepared tonight."
02:02:15;02:02:19;"And I feel like I've just been getting a lot of snarky energy, frankly."
02:02:19;02:02:25;"And Jake, I don't know about your process, but I certainly don't--"
02:02:25;02:02:32;"I know that I don't come into your art studio and start commenting on your work as you do it in real time."
02:02:32;02:02:34;"Same goes for you, Ezra."
02:02:34;02:02:36;"I would never let you do that."
02:02:36;02:02:40;"Okay, look, someone's getting lost in translation."
02:02:40;02:02:43;"I know we had text about you coming by the studio."
02:02:43;02:02:45;"I'm rescinding the invitation."
02:02:45;02:02:46;"Whoa."
02:02:46;02:02:49;"Wait, no, no, I--"
02:02:49;02:02:53;"I like this new plot point. It's Jake versus Seinfeld."
02:02:53;02:02:54;"Invitation rescinded."
02:02:54;02:02:59;"I'm sorry if we got a snarky energy in the way our tones--"
02:02:59;02:03:02;"First of all, you got to understand, you might not understand this as a Canadian,"
02:03:02;02:03:04;"it's Super Bowl Sunday."
02:03:04;02:03:06;"It's basically a holiday in the U.S."
02:03:06;02:03:09;"And we might be adopting a kind of snarky bro-type humor,"
02:03:09;02:03:14;"but only because this is a day when we get that kind of energy."
02:03:14;02:03:18;"You know, the guys get together, they have a laugh, watch funny Budweiser ads."
02:03:18;02:03:21;"So there might be a bit of a cultural thing happening here."
02:03:21;02:03:24;"It's not like when you watch the CFL Grey Cup."
02:03:24;02:03:26;"It's a little bit of a different--"
02:03:26;02:03:27;"It's a little bit of a different energy."
02:03:27;02:03:30;"And anyway, we're saying you did a great job with that."
02:03:30;02:03:33;"And we want you to--we want to bring--we're promoting you, Seinfeld."
02:03:33;02:03:35;"You just got a promotion."
02:03:35;02:03:36;"Oh, okay."
02:03:36;02:03:39;"You are no longer our social media intern."
02:03:39;02:03:42;"You are our CMO, Chief Marketing Officer."
02:03:42;02:03:45;"That actually is a great feeling, man."
02:03:45;02:03:49;"And I got to say, I feel bad that I exploded there."
02:03:49;02:03:53;"You know, it's a role that I accept, and I will take it seriously."
02:03:53;02:03:55;"I appreciate you talking me down"
02:03:55;02:03:58;"and making me really feel like a valued member of the crisis crew."
02:03:58;02:04:01;"I can't have my guys fighting."
02:04:01;02:04:02;"I'm like a coach."
02:04:02;02:04:04;"I can't have my guys fighting."
02:04:04;02:04:06;"Listen, our enemy--"
02:04:06;02:04:07;"I appreciate it."
02:04:07;02:04:10;"Our enemy is the San Francisco 49ers, not each other."
02:04:10;02:04:12;"I don't know why I chose that we're the Chiefs."
02:04:12;02:04:13;"But--"
02:04:13;02:04:14;"Party unity."
02:04:14;02:04:17;"But Seinfeld, seriously, write up some copy"
02:04:17;02:04:20;"that's one or two succinct paragraphs"
02:04:20;02:04:23;"that will help explain time crisis to the layperson."
02:04:23;02:04:25;"We're going to print up about 30 of them."
02:04:25;02:04:27;"We're going to laminate them,"
02:04:27;02:04:30;"and we're going to send them out to 30 of the biggest TC heads."
02:04:30;02:04:31;"Okay?"
02:04:31;02:04:33;"All right. I'm on it."
02:04:33;02:04:35;"Well, that's about all the time we have."
02:04:35;02:04:37;"We'll see you next time."
02:04:37;02:04:39;"Seinfeld, you going to get back to the studio soon?"
02:04:39;02:04:40;"Oh, yeah."
