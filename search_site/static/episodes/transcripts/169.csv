00:00;00:09;"Time Crisis, back again. In this episode we talk music publishing, performance"
00:09;00:19;"rights, the year 1969, and HUMAN, the double album. We'll learn so much about"
00:19;00:30;"the music industry and the culture. This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:16;01:25;"Oh I'm snacking. Time Crisis back again. Sorry, I hope it's not too noisy. All right, I'll stop for now."
01:25;01:32;"Were you snacking on those leftover megabytes or what? I do have some megabytes left. I've given"
01:32;01:37;"them to my son for snacks a few times but I made the mistake of explaining to him in painstaking"
01:37;01:43;"TC detail initially that these were gold larger goldfish marketed to grown-ups. So sometimes when"
01:43;01:47;"he's asked for like a fun snack as children do I'll be like oh what about these and I'll be like"
01:47;01:53;"those are for grown-ups. Like come on man just eat the megabytes. Now I'm eating Asha Pops,"
01:53;02:00;"a real LA snack baked and handcrafted in LA. Popped water lily seeds. Wow I don't know what the"
02:00;02:07;"hell that is. You see them at all the Erewhon and all like the kind of bougie LA supermarkets but"
02:07;02:13;"they're good. They're popped water lily seeds. Asha and Jay are a mother and son team. Seems"
02:13;02:18;"of a South Asian descent and brought this snack to the US. All right. They do it together like that,"
02:18;02:24;"a family business and they're flavored and they're I don't know they're crunchy, they're good."
02:24;02:30;"Shout out to Asha Pops. I think it's a good snack. You don't see a lot of mother-son teams in the"
02:30;02:37;"snack industry. I feel like it's always brothers or father-son. Father-sons, maybe mother-daughters."
02:37;02:43;"Sure. Just a mom and a son teaming up to do business. Ezra. Yeah. I have to hold you to"
02:43;02:48;"account a little bit. I was about to hold you to account on this episode. I wonder what you're"
02:48;02:55;"about to say. Well I'm going to say did you drink any Folgers in the last two weeks? Oh god I don't"
02:55;02:59;"even remember what I said. I said I was going to drink it for the next two weeks. Yeah you felt"
02:59;03:04;"like you had been a little hard on them questioning their claim to New Orleans being their hometown"
03:04;03:10;"and you said you know what I'm going to drink some. Thanks for reminding me Jake. I'll do it"
03:10;03:15;"for next episode. All right. Not only did I forget about that the instant after we wrapped the"
03:15;03:21;"episode in the last couple weeks I even went more hipster with my coffee. Been buying some sort of"
03:21;03:27;"like glass jar cold brew concentrate which I think tastes good. I've just been drinking the concentrate"
03:27;03:33;"ice cold in the morning. I thought you were lukewarm on cold brew. Yeah. It's too strong"
03:33;03:39;"for you. It's not it was never that it was too strong. I like it strong. I just always I still"
03:39;03:45;"consider most cold brew to be what I call sour diesel and there's so many times where I'll get"
03:45;03:52;"a cold brew from a coffee shop and I'll say no no this is that sour diesel. I don't like it. Yeah."
03:52;03:57;"It's sour. It tastes weird. I don't know why this one brand I'm shouting out all these like little"
03:57;04:02;"brands today. I think it's called chameleon. I think there's a chameleon on the thing. It comes"
04:02;04:09;"in glass bottles and the concentrate it's not sour and I don't even like to dilute it. I like to drink"
04:09;04:13;"it. Gives me a nice clean high. A balanced brew it sounds like. You know what no are you getting"
04:13;04:21;"that at a Erewhon as well? And you're getting those popped water lily buds? You can get this all over."
04:21;04:26;"I order it sometimes. Yeah you would find this at an Erewhon type place. You might even find it at"
04:26;04:31;"a more mainstream supermarket now that everybody likes all the same stuff. But Jake can I hold you"
04:31;04:37;"to account? Sure. Did you get the first birthday present that I sent to your daughter? I don't"
04:37;04:43;"believe so. Okay maybe it never even showed up. Wait hold on what was it? Well this puts me in an"
04:43;04:48;"awkward position because either it never showed up or it got swiped from your porch but now I'd"
04:48;04:54;"have to if I describe it I'll lose the element of surprise that's important. Well when did you mail"
04:54;04:59;"it? Should have gotten to your house last week. I'm gonna feel like an ass if you say what it is"
04:59;05:06;"and I'm like oh yeah. This is so specific that you would probably think of me when it came."
05:06;05:13;"Was it not signed? Like there was no card? Man I don't know. What's the tracking number? Is there"
05:13;05:20;"a tracking number? Yes I need a number crunch. No no there's supposed to be a card. It was a"
05:20;05:28;"handmade crocheted plush toy. Do you remember receiving any handmade crocheted plush toys?"
05:28;05:37;"I don't think so. Oh man. Wait what did you send? It was a little stuffed crocheted forklift"
05:37;05:45;"for a small child to play with. A little forklift stuffy. Yeah I don't think we got that man."
05:45;05:49;"All right Seinfeld you have to do some real number crunching and some detective work."
05:49;05:55;"You know it's probably still on the way. Supply chain issues and whatnot. I wouldn't be surprised."
05:55;05:59;"I think it said that it was delivered but I'll tell you what this wouldn't be the first time"
05:59;06:06;"that I sent a baby gift and then I found out that it had been stolen. Can I throw this in the mix?"
06:06;06:11;"Yeah. It probably was delivered and it might have gotten opened without me being there."
06:11;06:17;"Very possible. And I'm not aware of it. I think that's probably the highest likelihood"
06:17;06:24;"is that it's in a pile of other stuffed animals and stuff and it's kind of lost in the mix."
06:24;06:30;"No I don't think it's possible because if it came if your daughter received a crocheted plush toy"
06:30;06:36;"forklift that'd instantly become her favorite toy. She'd be playing with it 24/7. There's"
06:36;06:41;"no way it would be thrown in a pile of other toys. That is true actually."
06:51;06:54;"Time is my life, no it hurts"
06:54;06:59;"What does it mean to take a glass and not get sweaty?"
06:59;07:06;"It's just one time, just one time, just one time, just one time, baby"
07:06;07:16;"Our summer sucks, it's been a week, we had a dancey whiff"
07:16;07:21;"Old lady full of nickels, full of nickels and dimes"
07:21;07:27;"Makes me tired, lose myself, lose my cash"
07:27;07:32;"But get real, I'm a sucker, and I'm a sucker for a woman"
07:32;07:37;"And it's easy to be a sucker if everybody in the city got a body"
07:37;07:39;"But can you eat something at all?"
07:39;07:41;"I'm a sucker for a woman"
07:41;07:46;"I'm gonna scour through her plush toys when I get home"
07:46;07:48;"I have a feeling it's there"
07:48;07:49;"I hope so"
07:49;07:52;"There is an epidemic of box stealing"
07:52;07:54;"We've had it happen once or twice"
07:54;07:57;"Not recently, knock on wood"
07:57;07:59;"Alright, well I'm praying that it's there"
07:59;08:04;"That was a very, um, kinda lightweight holding each other to account"
08:04;08:06;"Yeah"
08:06;08:09;"I'm glad that we both got something off our chest"
08:09;08:14;"Hey man, I wanted to check in with you about your New Year's resolution"
08:14;08:19;"You know, now that it's March, I'm pretty sure you said you wanted to drink more Folgers this year"
08:19;08:22;"Just wanted to make sure, you know, are you actually doing it?"
08:22;08:25;"Well, speaking of holding people to account, Seinfeld"
08:25;08:27;"What's the latest with Chet?"
08:27;08:28;"Oh, great question"
08:28;08:29;"Oh my goodness"
08:29;08:31;"Hanks Fit? Fit Hanks?"
08:31;08:37;"Well, truthfully, I've maintained the nutritional regimen"
08:37;08:42;"But I've been a little too busy to keep up with the burpees, is the truth"
08:42;08:46;"Which is to say that I have dropped a few pounds"
08:46;08:47;"You look a slim"
08:47;08:49;"Well, I mean, thank you"
08:49;08:51;"And right back at ya"
08:51;08:55;"But, you know, the exercise has dropped off a little bit"
08:55;08:58;"Due to the busy nature of my life at this current time"
08:58;09:04;"But I do think that Hanks' nutritional plan was a gift"
09:04;09:07;"I've been keeping up with it, and I feel great, I feel lighter on my feet"
09:07;09:10;"So, all is not lost, and thanks for checking in"
09:10;09:12;"I think let's circle back in the summer"
09:12;09:15;"I might be going full Hanks Fit again"
09:15;09:17;"But I am a little ashamed to admit that"
09:17;09:18;"But again, the fitness component"
09:18;09:22;"Which is one of the most important parts of it has slipped a little bit"
09:22;09:25;"Now, has he even hit you up?"
09:25;09:29;"Oh boy, well, now we're going a layer deeper"
09:29;09:33;"Because I did inform him"
09:33;09:34;"You know, here's what happened"
09:34;09:36;"I received an invoice"
09:36;09:40;"I said I wasn't able to keep up with, you know, the exercise part of the plan"
09:40;09:44;"And over text, he did not make me feel especially great about that"
09:44;09:45;"And I deserved it"
09:45;09:47;"I'm not trying to shirk that at all"
09:47;09:50;"But certainly he had a few words for me about, you know"
09:50;09:52;"Twitter's never win, that sort of talk"
09:52;09:53;"And I did say to him, you know, we'll..."
09:53;09:54;"Let's be clear"
09:54;10:00;"He wasn't busting your b*** just because he was losing a paying client"
10:00;10:00;"No"
10:00;10:02;"He's going to be absolutely fine without your money"
10:02;10:04;"Oh, for sure, yeah"
10:04;10:06;"He was busting your b*** because he was so..."
10:06;10:11;"Just kind of let down to see a fellow man not giving his all"
10:11;10:12;"Yeah, I think that's about right"
10:12;10:14;"And, you know, he..."
10:14;10:19;"I think the writing was on the wall because, you know, he has these weekend Zoom calls"
10:19;10:22;"And I wasn't showing up to those"
10:22;10:25;"So it couldn't have been a surprise when I dropped off"
10:25;10:28;"But you're right, I think, you know, it's just..."
10:28;10:31;"You know, he was just let down in general, not for losing the business"
10:31;10:34;"But just for my sake, on my behalf"
10:34;10:35;"So, yeah, you're right about that"
10:35;10:38;"But I'll be back, I'll be back in the Hanks Fit world"
10:38;10:39;"Okay, glad to hear it"
10:39;10:41;"We've really held each other to account here"
10:41;10:46;"All right, glad we cleared the air"
10:46;10:48;"Doing that mid-March check-in"
10:48;10:51;"A lot of promises are made in the early months of the year"
10:51;10:54;"They often go by the wayside instantly"
10:54;10:56;"Well, you know what I want to start with?"
10:56;10:59;"Because I feel like this has been on the docket for months"
10:59;11:02;"It's always getting punted because there's some hot news"
11:02;11:04;"Like, you know, the jury sign fell"
11:04;11:08;"Pop-Tarts movie is, you know, going into production"
11:08;11:12;"Which, by the way, you know, we were questioning if perhaps that movie's not real"
11:12;11:15;"It was part of some sort of elaborate tax scam or something"
11:15;11:17;"Or we thought there was something kind of strange about it"
11:17;11:20;"But I was randomly talking to a musician friend, I won't say who"
11:20;11:22;"Because this is their private business"
11:22;11:24;"And I was like, just making small talks"
11:24;11:25;"""Did you hear about this Pop-Tarts movie?"""
11:25;11:28;"And he said, ""Oh, yeah, I'm writing a song for it"""
11:28;11:30;"And I was like, ""Okay"""
11:30;11:32;"And they said, ""Oh, yeah, I read the script"""
11:32;11:35;"""It's gonna be great"""
11:35;11:36;"So, who knows?"
11:36;11:40;"Is he writing like a jingle or like, writing a song?"
11:40;11:44;"Maybe it's like just a feel-good, like, never give up on your dreams"
11:44;11:46;"Kind of closing credits type song"
11:46;11:48;"I'll keep doing some research, but the movie is real, folks"
11:48;11:53;"Commissioning an original song for the closing credits?"
11:53;11:54;"Amazing"
11:54;11:57;"Jerry wants a hit soundtrack to the Pop-Tarts movie"
12:18;12:19;"You want to start with the catalogues"
12:19;12:21;"But anyway, yes, the music catalogues"
12:21;12:26;"Because, A, we did go pretty hard on the food last time"
12:26;12:29;"It's always gonna be part of Timecredits, as we said, somewhat controversial"
12:29;12:30;"But I thought we brought our A-game"
12:30;12:34;"But, look, at the end of the day, we're also at least 50% of Music Show"
12:34;12:38;"And we've never, I don't think we've talked about this too much on the show"
12:38;12:40;"But everybody's selling their catalogues"
12:40;12:43;"Maybe we talked about it with their publishing"
12:43;12:45;"But a lot of people are selling their master recordings"
12:45;12:48;"And I think whenever the last time we might have talked about it was"
12:48;12:52;"So many of the heavy hitters have come through selling stuff"
12:52;12:52;"Yeah"
12:52;12:53;"Bob Dylan sold it all"
12:53;12:56;"Bruce Springsteen sold it all"
12:56;12:58;"Neil Young sold it all"
12:58;13:00;"Yeah, it's big business"
13:00;13:01;"The numbers are staggering"
13:01;13:03;"Oh yeah, Paul Simon"
13:03;13:04;"All the big wigs"
13:04;13:05;"Sting"
13:05;13:08;"And then also as a music industry professional myself"
13:08;13:10;"I'm also hearing about ones that maybe aren't making the news"
13:10;13:12;"You know, more of like a mid-career artist"
13:12;13:14;"Who just decides to sell"
13:14;13:15;"This is happening as well"
13:15;13:19;"Well, I'm seeing that Killers sold all releases up to 2020"
13:19;13:22;"To Elridge Industries, price undisclosed"
13:22;13:24;"Whoa, I didn't know about that one"
13:24;13:25;"Killers?"
13:25;13:26;"Friends of the show, Killers"
13:26;13:27;"Yeah, mid-career"
13:27;13:31;"I mean, they're the only ones on this list that I'm looking at"
13:31;13:34;"That seem to be sort of contemporary"
13:34;13:36;"One interesting thing about it is"
13:36;13:39;"For a lot of the big names, the number"
13:39;13:40;"The price is in the news"
13:40;13:42;"So like Bob Dylan sold his entire publishing catalogue"
13:42;13:44;"To Universal Music Publishing"
13:44;13:47;"For an estimated three to four hundred million"
13:47;13:49;"And then he sold his master recordings to Sony"
13:49;13:51;"For another two hundred million"
13:51;13:54;"So Bob Dylan just walking away with a cool six hundred million"
13:54;13:56;"In the past year"
13:56;13:58;"When it says he sold the master recordings"
13:58;14:00;"Like he owned the recording of like"
14:00;14:04;"Blonde on Blonde and Blood on the Tracks and stuff?"
14:04;14:07;"Or are those still Columbia Records property, you think?"
14:07;14:09;"Well, that's a great question"
14:09;14:12;"Because my understanding is that"
14:12;14:13;"In the early to mid-sixties"
14:13;14:17;"It'd be highly unusual for an artist to sign a deal"
14:17;14:19;"Where they had ownership of the masters"
14:19;14:20;"Yeah"
14:20;14:22;"And obviously there's these famous stories about"
14:22;14:25;"The Beach Boys or, you know, somebody who like sold"
14:25;14:27;"All of their early amazing work"
14:27;14:28;"You know, for barely anything"
14:28;14:31;"With like zero interest in it"
14:31;14:32;"So it would be unusual"
14:32;14:34;"So I don't know what the Bob Dylan story is"
14:34;14:35;"But I will say"
14:35;14:38;"Sometimes you hear about these like big names"
14:38;14:39;"Who, when they made so much money"
14:39;14:41;"They went back in the seventies or eighties"
14:41;14:43;"And bought their masters back"
14:43;14:45;"Or maybe it reverted to them at some point"
14:45;14:46;"So I don't know, I mean"
14:46;14:48;"If Sony gave them two hundred million dollars"
14:48;14:50;"They must, there's no way"
14:50;14:53;"They were just like paying for his like eighties work"
14:53;14:54;"Right"
14:54;14:56;"As much as I love Joker Man"
14:56;14:58;"That's definitely a top five Bob song"
14:58;15:00;"Joker Man's not gonna be, you know"
15:00;15:03;"Raking in the commercial money"
15:03;15:05;"The way that like a blowin' in the wind would"
15:05;15:07;"I would think that the master recordings"
15:07;15:10;"Would be worth more than the actual publishing"
15:10;15:11;"But I don't know, I'm a"
15:11;15:13;"I don't know anything about this world really"
15:13;15:16;"Because I would figure you're gonna license the record"
15:16;15:18;"The song is great"
15:18;15:19;"And you hear someone cover the song"
15:19;15:20;"Maybe it's good, maybe it's not"
15:20;15:24;"But our cultural memory is attached to these recordings"
15:24;15:27;"Of these songs from the sixties and seventies"
15:27;15:29;"And if you're gonna use that in a movie or"
15:29;15:32;"Or an ad, that's the most powerful"
15:32;15:33;"Realization of that"
15:33;15:36;"Well, but in the case of a Bob Dylan"
15:36;15:38;"He's written so many songs"
15:38;15:39;"People have"
15:39;15:41;"On the really big Adele album"
15:41;15:43;"There's a Bob Dylan cover"
15:43;15:43;"What song?"
15:43;15:44;"Sounds like I get a number crunch"
15:44;15:46;"Adele covered"
15:46;15:47;"Make You Feel My Love"
15:47;15:48;"Is that right?"
15:48;15:49;"That's correct"
15:49;15:50;"What era is that from?"
15:50;15:51;"Matt, can we get up"
15:51;15:53;"Make You Feel My Love by Bob Dylan?"
15:53;15:55;"I believe that that is"
15:55;15:58;"It's one of the favorite late period Bob songs"
15:58;16:00;"I think it's on"
16:00;16:02;"Time Outta Mind"
16:02;16:04;"Like a late nineties Bob"
16:04;16:05;"Kinda sweet ballad"
16:05;16:08;"That's right, it's 1997 Time Outta"
16:08;16:08;"Gotcha"
16:08;16:09;"Outta Mind"
16:09;16:12;"Showing my ignorance of late period Bob"
16:12;16:13;"Are you familiar with that album in particular"
16:13;16:14;"Time Outta Mind?"
16:14;16:15;"No"
16:15;16:17;"I've just been getting into Oh Mercy"
16:17;16:19;"Which is from '89"
16:19;16:21;"I'm slowly working my way"
16:21;16:22;"You're almost in the nineties"
16:22;16:24;"I'm almost there"
16:24;16:25;"This is interesting"
16:25;16:28;"It was first released commercially by Billy Joel"
16:28;16:30;"Under the title to Make You Feel My Love"
16:30;16:33;"Before Dylan's version came out the same year"
16:33;16:34;"Like Bob showed it to Billy Joel"
16:34;16:36;"He's like, hey, check this song out"
16:36;16:37;"It's mine now"
16:37;16:43;"I have this memory of it"
16:43;16:45;"This album"
16:45;16:49;"Time Outta Mind being the last CD my parents ever bought"
16:49;16:50;"That makes sense"
16:50;16:55;"Like Tunnel of Love and Time Outta Mind feel like"
16:55;16:57;"Them trying to stay in the game"
16:57;16:59;"Great grown up albums"
16:59;17:03;"Yeah, but they're both great grown up albums by like"
17:03;17:05;"Iconic American artists"
17:05;17:07;"After their youthful periods"
17:07;17:09;"Who just sold their catalogs"
17:09;17:10;"And who are on Columbia Records"
17:10;17:14;"And there is no one there to die or tease"
17:14;17:16;"I could hold you for a million years"
17:16;17:19;"So this really sounds like an Adele song"
17:19;17:22;"Although one of the opening lines is about"
17:22;17:24;"When the whole world is on your case"
17:24;17:28;"Play the Bob Dylan version"
17:28;17:31;"Are you a fan of Time Outta Mind, Ezra?"
17:31;17:33;"You know, I've always been wanting to go deeper"
17:33;17:36;"Because the Dylan heads love it"
17:36;17:40;"I've thrown it on here and there"
17:40;17:43;"This kind of sounds more like he's covering Adele"
17:43;17:46;"You know what I mean? Couldn't you just hear like"
17:46;17:48;"Some headline just like"
17:48;17:51;"Weird Bob Dylan cover of Adele on his new record"
17:51;17:53;"And you like throw it on and it sounds like this"
17:53;17:54;"And you'd be like, alright"
17:54;17:56;"Alright Bob, interesting interpretation"
17:56;18:01;"And the evening shatters and the stars appear"
18:01;18:09;"And there is no one there to dry your tears"
18:09;18:13;"I could hold you for a million years"
18:13;18:15;"But I guess just to go back to the publishing"
18:15;18:19;"Versus the master distinction"
18:19;18:21;"Yeah, master recordings in the streaming era"
18:21;18:24;"I think maybe are slightly more valuable"
18:24;18:26;"But in the case of like a Bob Dylan"
18:26;18:31;"The fact that he wrote a song on Adele's gigantic album"
18:31;18:34;"Was probably like the most money"
18:34;18:38;"One of his late period songs raked in by a mile"
18:38;18:42;"You know, so like Bob Dylan is like often covered"
18:42;18:44;"And you know like there's that Rod Stewart"
18:44;18:46;"Forever Young where he had"
18:46;18:47;"He like realized he kind of ripped off Bob"
18:47;18:49;"And he gave him some publishing"
18:49;18:51;"And so I don't know"
18:51;18:52;"Also in the case of Bob Dylan"
18:52;18:53;"There's probably all this money coming in"
18:53;18:55;"From like weird surprising sources"
18:55;18:59;"Like blowing in the wind, being performed"
18:59;19:01;"Just the really old school stuff"
19:01;19:04;"Adele claims to have quote saved Bob Dylan"
19:04;19:06;"With the royalties earned from her single"
19:06;19:09;"Adele has claimed, this is in 2011"
19:09;19:12;"Adele has claimed that she quote saved Bob Dylan"
19:12;19:15;"With the royalties he earned from her rendition"
19:15;19:16;"Of Make You Feel My Love"
19:16;19:17;"The singer believes that the track"
19:17;19:19;"Which is expected to chart at the top five on Sunday"
19:19;19:24;"Will earn Dylan over one million in the next few months"
19:24;19:26;"And it is his second favorite version"
19:26;19:31;"After his own, she told The Sun"
19:31;19:34;"That's some classic Bob Dylan weird sense of humor"
19:34;19:36;"First of all, he's probably doing like a prank call"
19:36;19:38;"I mean there's no way Bob Dylan was saved"
19:38;19:40;"By one million dollars"
19:40;19:42;"Many people would be saved by one million dollars"
19:42;19:45;"I don't see Bob Dylan being that person"
19:45;19:46;"But I can picture him just kind of like"
19:46;19:48;"Almost giggling and like calling"
19:48;19:49;"He's like, hello?"
19:49;19:50;"Is this Adele?"
19:50;19:51;"She's like, oh my god Bob!"
19:51;19:52;"Bob Dylan, what?"
19:52;19:53;"Are you really calling me?"
19:53;19:59;"And he's like, yeah I just wanted to say"
19:59;20:01;"Thanks for covering that song"
20:01;20:03;"Damn I was about to go broke"
20:03;20:05;"I needed that million real bad"
20:05;20:06;"I was behind on my car payments"
20:07;20:09;"And they're being like, oh really?"
20:09;20:10;"Like okay"
20:10;20:14;"Yeah man, they're about to come take my van"
20:14;20:15;"Oh man"
20:15;20:17;"Yeah, it was pretty dark"
20:17;20:19;"Anyway, I just wanted to say great job"
20:19;20:22;"It's my second favorite version of the song"
20:22;20:23;"After mine"
20:23;20:24;"Have a good one"
20:24;20:29;"You know, and just so she doesn't seem"
20:29;20:31;"Give it some context"
20:31;20:33;"So she doesn't seem like a maniac either"
20:33;20:34;"Because you said, what do you mean saved?"
20:34;20:36;"I think Adele's also pretty funny"
20:36;20:38;"She said, look, someone told me the other day"
20:38;20:40;"That I killed Bob Dylan"
20:40;20:41;"With Make You Feel My Love"
20:41;20:44;"I actually think I saved him"
20:44;20:48;"But then he said, and this is funny"
20:48;20:50;"I reckon with the amount it's been played on the radio"
20:50;20:54;"It's worth a lot to maybe he'll buy me a watch or something"
20:54;20:55;"So I feel like she's being cute"
20:55;20:57;"Yeah, yeah"
20:57;20:59;"They probably had a very humorous discussion"
20:59;21:02;"Yeah, I mean, you know, in this day and age"
21:02;21:04;"Like back in the day"
21:04;21:05;"There were so many covers all the time"
21:05;21:06;"Like people always say that yesterday"
21:06;21:09;"The Beatles song has been like the most covered song ever"
21:09;21:11;"500 versions"
21:11;21:13;"And so in this day and age"
21:13;21:16;"If you're like a huge songwriter"
21:16;21:17;"It's kind of..."
21:17;21:18;"I don't know though"
21:18;21:21;"Even with Dylan, I gotta say like"
21:21;21:22;"Yeah, there's some iconic Dylan covers"
21:22;21:24;"But the bulk of his stuff"
21:24;21:26;"You remember the version that he did"
21:26;21:29;"I mean, someone might cover, you know"
21:29;21:31;"Desolation Row or something"
21:31;21:32;"But you're not gonna"
21:32;21:33;"It's not gonna make the impact"
21:33;21:36;"That his recording of it did"
21:36;21:39;"Every time Vampire Weekend drops to Joker Man Live"
21:39;21:42;"ASCAP is paying Bob Dylan"
21:42;21:43;"You save Bob Dylan"
21:43;21:44;"We save Bob Dylan"
21:44;21:46;"I reckon with all the times we've covered Joker Man"
21:46;21:49;"He might've made three to four hundred dollars"
21:49;21:50;"For real?"
21:50;21:51;"I don't know how it works"
21:51;21:53;"But I really should know better"
21:53;21:55;"One day we'll do a whole"
21:55;21:58;"Time Crisis Guide to the Music Industry"
21:58;22:00;"'Cause I'm a music industry professional"
22:00;22:01;"I've learned a thing or two"
22:01;22:04;"I probably don't know as much as I should"
22:04;22:06;"But so you know, ASCAP is a collections agency"
22:06;22:07;"It's not the only one"
22:07;22:09;"But it's kind of the most famous one"
22:09;22:10;"ASCAP"
22:10;22:12;"So it's a collections agency"
22:12;22:13;"Which means"
22:13;22:14;"As I understand it"
22:14;22:18;"They're grabbing payments for music"
22:18;22:22;"That transcend the master publishing binary"
22:22;22:24;"I mean, it's kind of like publishing"
22:24;22:25;"But there's little royalties"
22:25;22:27;"That you might not think of"
22:27;22:28;"That somebody needs to collect"
22:28;22:30;"From like music played in bars"
22:30;22:32;"Or on digital jukeboxes"
22:32;22:34;"There's all this like random stuff"
22:34;22:35;"And there is money"
22:35;22:37;"And I don't know"
22:37;22:38;"The music industry is so weird"
22:38;22:40;"Like sometimes I'll hear some story"
22:40;22:41;"Where somebody's like"
22:41;22:42;"I'll hear from like my management"
22:42;22:43;"Back in the day like"
22:43;22:46;"Oh yeah, we hired this agency in Europe"
22:46;22:47;"'Cause you had a lot of royalties"
22:47;22:51;"Just like, you know, sitting uncollected"
22:51;22:54;"You know, like a few thousand bucks in Hungary"
22:54;22:57;"500 Euro in Lithuania"
22:57;22:59;"That was just sitting there"
22:59;23:00;"You're like, wait, what?"
23:00;23:01;"And they're like, yeah"
23:01;23:02;"So you got to hire an agency"
23:02;23:03;"Goes and gets it"
23:03;23:04;"Why do they do that?"
23:04;23:06;"And it's like, well, you know, they take a cut"
23:06;23:07;"That's how you get it"
23:07;23:08;"It's weird"
23:08;23:08;"Well, hold on"
23:08;23:10;"Let's back up to Vampire Weekend"
23:10;23:12;"Covering Joker, man"
23:12;23:13;"Yes, OK"
23:13;23:14;"So you literally think"
23:14;23:16;"That ASCAP sent him a check?"
23:16;23:18;"Like so ASCAP"
23:18;23:19;"Collected money from the venue"
23:19;23:20;"Or from you?"
23:20;23:21;"From the venue"
23:21;23:23;"So the venue reports"
23:23;23:25;"The set lists to ASCAP?"
23:25;23:27;"This part sounds crazy, but this is true"
23:27;23:28;"This is mind-blowing"
23:28;23:31;"ASCAP, a lot of restaurants, bars"
23:31;23:34;"And particularly venues report to ASCAP"
23:34;23:37;"Wait, restaurants and bars?"
23:37;23:39;"Like if you're just playing music over the PA"
23:39;23:42;"You like have like an Italian restaurant"
23:42;23:44;"And it's like very low volume"
23:44;23:47;"And you're playing scenes from an Italian restaurant"
23:47;23:48;"At your Italian restaurant"
23:48;23:50;"At a very low volume"
23:50;23:52;"To the point where it's just more of just kind of like"
23:52;23:54;"Background ambient music"
23:54;23:57;"No one's even like really there to listen to music"
23:57;24:00;"They're there to eat the pasta"
24:00;24:01;"And the bread"
24:01;24:03;"Have a bottle of red, drink a bottle of red"
24:03;24:04;"A bottle of white"
24:04;24:05;"Here's where I'm going to"
24:05;24:07;"I have to plead ignorance a little bit"
24:07;24:08;"I think you're right"
24:08;24:11;"That not every single bar restaurant in the US"
24:11;24:13;"Is paying ASCAP money"
24:13;24:15;"Because there's some sort of cut off"
24:15;24:17;"In fact, I mean, this is such an annoying number crunch"
24:17;24:19;"But Seinfeld, Nick"
24:19;24:21;"You guys want to like Google this as I'm talking"
24:21;24:22;"Maybe you can help me explain it"
24:22;24:25;"My understanding is that, for instance, with venues"
24:25;24:27;"There's a certain threshold"
24:27;24:29;"I don't know if it has to do with"
24:29;24:31;"Different venues have different deals"
24:31;24:33;"Or if it has to do with the capacity"
24:33;24:34;"Because I could totally see that"
24:34;24:37;"That ASCAP maybe goes to arenas"
24:37;24:39;"And says like, listen, you got to do this by the books"
24:39;24:42;"You got to pay songwriters"
24:42;24:43;"But they're not going to go to like, you know"
24:43;24:47;"A punk house in Iowa City"
24:47;24:48;"And just like, you know"
24:48;24:50;"Just send some local person to be like"
24:50;24:54;"We heard a local hardcore band did an ironic cover of"
24:54;24:56;"Hit Me Baby One More Time, pay up"
24:56;24:58;"Like that's not happening"
24:58;24:59;"There's some sort of threshold"
24:59;25:01;"But truly, I remember at a certain point"
25:01;25:03;"When we were touring"
25:03;25:04;"I don't know if the shows got big enough"
25:04;25:06;"Or it was the venues we were playing"
25:06;25:07;"Our tour manager started to like"
25:07;25:09;"Ask for the set list"
25:09;25:10;"And this is back in the day"
25:10;25:11;"When we didn't even change the set list"
25:11;25:13;"And I was like, wait, why?"
25:13;25:15;"And he'd be like, the venue needs it"
25:15;25:17;"To report to ASCAP"
25:17;25:20;"So I don't know if we got paid for playing our own songs"
25:20;25:23;"Or they need to see if there's a cover or something"
25:23;25:24;"Or maybe, you know, for instance"
25:24;25:26;"Let's say Madison Square Garden"
25:26;25:30;"Maybe just pays a flat fee to ASCAP every year"
25:30;25:32;"And then they look at all the music they played"
25:32;25:34;"Over the loudspeakers at Knicks games"
25:34;25:35;"And they look at all the songs that were covered"
25:35;25:37;"Maybe they divide it up"
25:37;25:38;"And maybe if they're like, oh"
25:38;25:41;"Somebody came through and covered Joker Man"
25:41;25:43;"They're like, well, that's five bucks for Bob"
25:43;25:45;"I don't know how it works"
25:45;25:46;"But it's something like this"
25:46;25:49;"There's a whole alternate universe of royalties"
25:49;25:51;"Did you cover Joker Man at MSG?"
25:51;25:52;"No, as I was saying"
25:52;25:53;"And I realized that's a bad example"
25:53;25:55;"Because we did not cover Joker Man at MSG"
25:55;25:57;"We dropped..."
25:57;25:58;"That would have been a baller"
25:58;26:02;"We did a notable Joker Man at..."
26:02;26:03;"In Indianapolis"
26:03;26:04;"You did it at Webster Hall"
26:04;26:05;"We did it at Webster Hall"
26:05;26:09;"So yeah, maybe Webster Hall pays ASCAP"
26:09;26:11;"Hopefully enough of our listeners"
26:11;26:12;"Are the type of people who are like"
26:12;26:13;"Vaguely interested in the music industry"
26:13;26:16;"But don't know, actually know how it works"
26:16;26:19;"So that my vague rambling is somewhat interesting"
26:19;26:21;"But yes, this is..."
26:21;26:23;"There is random royalties sitting there"
26:23;26:25;"All over the world"
26:25;26:27;"Who knows? You might have some somewhere"
26:27;26:28;"Well, I was going to say the big question is"
26:28;26:31;"All the times that Vampire Weekend covered Mountain Brews"
26:31;26:33;"Wait, Jake, I'm dead ass serious"
26:33;26:34;"Red Rocks..."
26:34;26:36;"Because we played Mountain Brews at Red Rocks"
26:36;26:38;"Red Rocks is exactly the type of venue"
26:38;26:40;"Because it's this iconic large venue"
26:40;26:42;"That would be paying ASCAP"
26:42;26:45;"I would imagine that we submitted the setlist"
26:45;26:46;"For night two at Red Rocks"
26:46;26:48;"And there could be..."
26:48;26:50;"You might need to talk to ASCAP, Jake"
26:50;26:52;"I need to hire one of those services"
26:52;26:54;"To go collect the Mountain Brews royalties"
26:54;26:57;"You could have hundreds of dollars sitting in Hungary"
26:57;26:58;"Right now with your name on it"
26:58;27:00;"I think our friend Morgan Leibus"
27:00;27:03;"Really gets off on doing this sort of thing"
27:03;27:05;"Oh really? Is this his purview?"
27:05;27:06;"Oh yeah, he'll chase down this money"
27:06;27:08;"Should we try to get Morgan on the phone real quick?"
27:08;27:09;"Oh my god, he'd be amazing"
27:09;27:11;"We were going to hire him"
27:11;27:13;"Amantha was going to hire him"
27:13;27:15;"To chase down some money that we thought might be owed"
27:15;27:18;"From some Capricorn stuff of her father's"
27:18;27:18;"He really..."
27:18;27:19;"We could get..."
27:19;27:21;"Yeah, so he's the kind of guy you hire"
27:21;27:22;"You want to call him right now?"
27:22;27:23;"Should we call him?"
27:23;27:25;"I think he'd be really fun to talk to"
27:25;27:26;"Let's call him"
27:26;27:28;"While you wait for this, something I noticed"
27:28;27:30;"Because you definitely have to pay"
27:30;27:32;"I mean, the bar has to pay ASCAP"
27:32;27:34;"The restaurant theoretically has to"
27:34;27:36;"It's why when you go into Starbucks"
27:36;27:37;"Or a large chain"
27:37;27:39;"It's always usually the same music or stuff"
27:39;27:40;"From CDs they put out"
27:40;27:42;"Because they have to pay this royalty"
27:42;27:44;"You can't just play whatever you want"
27:44;27:47;"Something I noticed recently is that in"
27:47;27:48;"COVID"
27:48;27:50;"When Amantha had to"
27:50;27:52;"Take a lot of her sort of"
27:52;27:53;"You know, workout"
27:53;27:55;"Classes online over Zoom"
27:55;27:58;"Certain ones didn't want to pay the ASCAP fee"
27:58;28:00;"So they're just using really whack"
28:00;28:01;"Oh right"
28:01;28:02;"See, that's a good example"
28:02;28:04;"And so she's taking these classes"
28:04;28:06;"That normally if you're in a small space"
28:06;28:08;"And you're playing Megan Thee Stallion"
28:08;28:10;"No one's going to report you"
28:10;28:12;"But if this is being sent out over a large Zoom"
28:12;28:14;"So they're just using"
28:14;28:16;"Just really like library music"
28:16;28:19;"I think there might have been a Peloton lawsuit already"
28:19;28:21;"Because at first"
28:21;28:22;"You know, Peloton's using some of the"
28:22;28:24;"You know, classic music"
28:24;28:26;"They're using the hits of today"
28:26;28:27;"They're doing Grateful Dead rides"
28:27;28:29;"They're using all the great music"
28:29;28:31;"And I think the music industry"
28:31;28:33;"Or some of these agencies had to negotiate with them"
28:33;28:35;"Because at a certain point"
28:35;28:36;"Yeah, like of course"
28:36;28:39;"If you go just to your local gym"
28:39;28:41;"And they're playing some music"
28:41;28:43;"Who knows if they're paying anything"
28:43;28:44;"But when you're"
28:44;28:46;"Peloton, that's kind of like a TV show"
28:46;28:49;"When you got like 20, 30,000 people tuning in"
28:49;28:52;"That's more people than watch a lot of TV shows these days"
28:52;28:54;"So like, yeah, it creates this thing"
28:54;28:56;"And anyway, I got to say with all this stuff"
28:56;28:58;"As I understand it"
28:58;29:00;"Just because you hear a song at a supermarket"
29:00;29:02;"That doesn't mean that that person's getting like super paid"
29:02;29:04;"They might be getting paid five cents"
29:04;29:06;"But in the case of a Bob Dylan"
29:06;29:09;"Just when you imagine how big his catalog is"
29:09;29:12;"When you start to like scale that up"
29:12;29:13;"And you're like at any given moment"
29:13;29:14;"Somewhere in the world"
29:14;29:17;"There's like a Bob Dylan song playing somewhere"
29:17;29:18;"Somebody's covering it"
29:18;29:20;"Maybe there's a megachurch"
29:20;29:23;"That, you know, broadcasts to millions of people"
29:23;29:24;"And they have, you know"
29:24;29:27;"30,000 people come to that megachurch every Sunday"
29:27;29:29;"And they do a special"
29:29;29:31;"I shall be released"
29:31;29:33;"Yeah, they bring somebody out to do"
29:33;29:34;"I shall be released"
29:34;29:37;"Or you got to serve somebody from his Christian period"
29:37;29:38;"There's all these like funny ways"
29:38;29:41;"So when you get to a Bob Dylan level"
29:41;29:43;"That could really get substantial"
29:43;29:45;"Because he has thousands of songs"
29:45;29:48;"But yeah, I've always kind of wanted to understand this a little better"
29:48;29:50;"If there's anybody listening from ASCAP"
29:50;29:53;"You can call the show and explain this to us"
29:53;29:55;"And it looks like a typical restaurant, for example"
29:55;29:57;"It's a couple hundred dollars probably"
29:57;30:00;"To pay whatever ASCAP fee to play music"
30:00;30:02;"But if you are caught"
30:02;30:04;"The penalty is anywhere between"
30:04;30:07;"A thousand to thirty thousand dollars"
30:07;30:10;"So ASCAP has like agents"
30:10;30:13;"The owner of the new smoothie and grain bowls place"
30:13;30:17;"Was renditioned by ASCAP private security"
30:17;30:20;"After failing to pay the yearly fee"
30:20;30:23;"It just turned out that a few years ago at least"
30:23;30:28;"The ASCAP fee for a restaurant is about $380"
30:28;30:30;"So that's any restaurant?"
30:30;30:31;"Any restaurant in America?"
30:31;30:36;"But yeah, any restaurant in America is supposed to pay $380"
30:36;30:37;"Which I can't tell here"
30:37;30:39;"But I guess it's like"
30:39;30:42;"Allows you to play any music that you want"
30:42;30:44;"Seems like a pretty small fee given the penalty"
30:44;30:46;"You know there's some kind of vibe coffee shops"
30:46;30:49;"That have mountain brews on rotation?"
30:49;30:50;"We gotta get Jake his money"
30:50;31:05;"Sunday morning, why don't we go for a hike?"
31:07;31:10;"Meet in the trailhead light around a quarter to three"
31:10;31:16;"Me and Bobby stayed out late last night"
31:16;31:21;"Get on the trail and shake the cobwebs free"
31:21;31:27;"As we get to the top of the mountain there's a view"
31:27;31:32;"Take a load off and crack a few mountain brews"
31:36;31:41;"Mountain brews"
31:41;31:44;"Sweet mountain brews"
31:44;31:51;"Mountain brews"
31:51;31:54;"Sweet as morning dew"
31:54;31:57;"Jake, I bet you have at least thousands of dollars"
31:57;32:00;"Sitting uncollected across the globe"
32:00;32:03;"And it would cost me thousands to retrieve it"
32:03;32:05;"Yeah, you're gonna be in the hole about 10k if you try to get it"
32:05;32:06;"But um"
32:06;32:09;"I, I, I, I"
32:09;32:11;"That's where a guy like Morgan comes in"
32:11;32:13;"Because he does it for free"
32:13;32:15;"If he thinks there's"
32:15;32:16;"If he sees the money"
32:16;32:17;"Passionate"
32:17;32:19;"Morgan's never doing God's work"
32:19;32:21;"He's doing it because he sees the money"
32:21;32:22;"He's like I'm gonna get myself a cut of that"
32:22;32:24;"So if he goes oh"
32:24;32:26;"That mountain brews"
32:26;32:27;"I see a paycheck"
32:27;32:31;"Right, I'll get Jake 2500 bucks and a little 500 for my troubles"
32:31;32:33;"Pretty good"
32:33;32:34;"I'll take that deal"
32:34;32:37;"I mean the whole reason we were talking about catalogs is because"
32:37;32:42;"Apparently Motley Crue sold their entire recorded music catalog to BMG"
32:42;32:44;"For an estimated 150 million"
32:44;32:46;"And I know this ever since you heard about this Jake"
32:46;32:49;"This has just blown your mind"
32:49;32:50;"How could Motley Crue's"
32:50;32:52;"You're on record on the show saying that"
32:52;32:56;"You don't respect Motley Crue's music or catalog at all"
32:56;32:57;"Well it just doesn't track"
32:57;33:00;"I mean 150 million's a lot of money"
33:00;33:03;"Stevie Nicks sold a majority stake in her songs"
33:03;33:05;"To Primary Wave for 100 million"
33:05;33:11;"Neil Young sold 50% of his catalog for an estimated 150 million"
33:11;33:14;"So if Neil Young sold half his catalog for 150"
33:14;33:18;"I guess we could say that means his catalog is worth 300"
33:18;33:23;"Is there any universe in which Motley Crue's catalog is worth 50% of Neil Young's?"
33:23;33:23;"No"
33:23;33:28;"Yeah if you asked me to spitball I would guess their catalog be worth 10% of Neil Young's"
33:28;33:28;"Precisely"
33:28;33:32;"And of course at their peak they were huge but it's like"
33:32;33:34;"I never hear Motley Crue anywhere"
33:34;33:37;"No we remember Motley Crue because of their image"
33:37;33:42;"Because of Tommy Lee and Tam and Pommy"
33:42;33:42;"Tam and Tommy"
33:42;33:43;"Tam and Pommy"
33:43;33:45;"[Laughter]"
33:45;33:46;"Tam and Paula"
33:46;33:50;"No we remember Motley Crue as icons of the 80s"
33:50;33:52;"But like their actual music"
33:52;33:53;"And I don't know does that translate?"
33:53;33:57;"Like just them being sort of iconic 80s guys"
33:57;34:00;"No and you pull some like 14 year olds off the street"
34:00;34:02;"Of like rock bands"
34:02;34:05;"Yeah they might know one AC/DC song, one Rolling Stones song"
34:05;34:07;"I think they're not going to know any Motley Crue songs"
34:07;34:07;"No"
34:07;34:10;"And by the way we're not pulling an Eddie Vedder here"
34:10;34:14;"We respect Motley Crue's artistry we're not trying to [ __ ] on them"
34:14;34:14;"I'm just saying that"
34:14;34:18;"It doesn't matter what I think about Motley Crue personally"
34:18;34:21;"I'm just saying the numbers like they have a great lawyer"
34:21;34:22;"That's what I'll say"
34:22;34:25;"I'll tell you one thing about these people who buy catalogs"
34:25;34:27;"There's big money behind this"
34:27;34:30;"The people investing in these companies that are buying up all the publishing"
34:30;34:31;"These are billionaires"
34:31;34:35;"These are you know the JP Morgans, the Black Rocks"
34:35;34:38;"These are serious business people"
34:38;34:40;"They're cracking open the books saying"
34:40;34:44;"Hey Neil Young's manager how much did Neil's catalog make last year?"
34:44;34:45;"I want to see everything"
34:45;34:47;"I'll give you 25 times that"
34:47;34:47;"Right"
34:47;34:49;"Or maybe with Neil Young because he's so prestigious"
34:49;34:51;"They'll say I'll give you 40 times"
34:51;34:52;"You know they'll really butt it up"
34:52;34:56;"But I've always had this explained to me as like multiples"
34:56;34:58;"Where they're like they look at how much you make in a year"
34:58;35:03;"And they say here's a check up front for your next 30 years of earnings"
35:03;35:04;"But now it's mine"
35:04;35:05;"Like they're looking hard at this"
35:05;35:09;"I don't see Motley Crue getting like a deal"
35:09;35:11;"So I think we have to confront the cold hard fact"
35:11;35:17;"That Motley Crue is way more popular in 2022 than we understand"
35:17;35:20;"People are enjoying their music"
35:20;35:21;"They're playing it"
35:21;35:25;"And they're confident that Motley Crue will be a true legacy artist"
35:25;35:28;"Whose music will be enjoyed in 10, 20, 30 years"
35:28;35:29;"Oh yeah"
35:29;35:31;"Also think about think about international"
35:31;35:33;"Think about like you know Malaysia"
35:33;35:34;"Think about you know Latvia"
35:34;35:36;"You know they they might be a lot bigger"
35:36;35:40;"Out in some of those places they might still be very relevant"
35:40;35:42;"Also just to put this in context"
35:42;35:47;"Imagine Dragons sold their catalog a couple years ago 100 million"
35:47;35:50;"And that's early so that's only for like a few albums"
35:50;35:53;"Honestly I feel like Imagine Dragons have more hits than Motley Crue"
35:53;35:54;"Okay"
35:54;35:56;"He's the one that got Dr. Feel Good"
35:56;35:58;"He's gonna make it feel alright"
35:58;36:03;"All right Jake which is a better band Imagine Dragons or Motley Crue?"
36:03;36:07;"Well I'm a sucker for Power Ballads so I'm gonna go Motley Crue"
36:07;36:09;"Because they got Without You and they got Home Sweet Home"
36:09;36:12;"Okay but what about Radioactive?"
36:12;36:14;"Is that a Imagine Dragons Power Ballad?"
36:14;36:16;"Power Ballad?"
36:16;36:20;"I'm really not trying to go Vetter here but Imagine Dragons is way better"
36:20;36:20;"Wow"
36:20;36:23;"They're more formally innovative than Motley Crue"
36:23;36:25;"Well Imagine Dragons I also respect them"
36:25;36:27;"Because I feel like they're just like out there on their own"
36:27;36:29;"They're like the biggest band in the world"
36:29;36:32;"I mean I've defended Imagine Dragons many times"
36:32;36:33;"Not that they need my my defense"
36:33;36:37;"They're sitting on a hundred million dollars plus"
36:37;36:43;"But you know back in the day when some people were popping off dissing them"
36:43;36:44;"We always took Imagine Dragons side"
36:44;36:47;"But I'll say yeah Imagine Dragons are weird because they're like"
36:47;36:49;"To me they're like the only band like them"
36:49;36:52;"They exist in this weird space between pop and rock"
36:52;36:54;"And they're they're just like doing their own thing"
36:54;36:58;"With Motley Crue they're so clearly part of this wave"
36:58;37:00;"So I think the tough part and I know you feel this way Jake"
37:00;37:02;"When we've talked about them in the past"
37:02;37:06;"It's like you instantly just start comparing them to like Def Leppard"
37:06;37:09;"And these bands that just have these like Guns N' Roses"
37:09;37:13;"These bands just like these other 80s rock/metal bands"
37:13;37:16;"That just kind of have superior songwriting"
37:16;37:17;"But that said"
37:17;37:23;"Motley Crue has four albums that have gone four times platinum"
37:23;37:24;"Motley Crue?"
37:24;37:25;"Yeah"
37:25;37:26;"Yeah look they did their thing"
37:26;37:29;"They've sold a lot of records"
37:29;37:30;"They don't have the catalog"
37:30;37:34;"I'm saying their cultural legacy is pure image"
37:34;37:37;"And I don't understand the value of their music going forward"
37:37;37:41;"As their image fades into the ether"
37:41;37:41;"I just don't-"
37:41;37:44;"Well look Pam and Tommy they're back in the news"
37:44;37:47;"Was there any Motley Crue in that show?"
37:47;37:47;"I don't think so"
37:47;37:48;"No but that-"
37:48;37:49;"The Dirt which you two loved"
37:49;37:50;"The Dirt?"
37:50;37:51;"I loved The Dirt"
37:51;37:54;"It was a top 10 album in 2019"
37:54;37:55;"The Dirt soundtrack"
37:55;37:57;"They're a legacy band"
37:57;38:01;"Three years ago Motley Crue was doing some serious damage on the charts"
38:01;38:04;"Jake you're living in your coastal liberal elite bubble"
38:04;38:08;"Where Motley Crue is not a major heritage act"
38:08;38:09;"But newsflash"
38:09;38:12;"You drive a few miles outside of Los Angeles"
38:12;38:16;"People are blasting Crue like 24/7"
38:16;38:20;"Motley Crue is worth half of what Neil Young is"
38:21;38:24;"Right and think about international too right?"
38:24;38:26;"South Africa, Korea"
38:26;38:28;"No I feel you Seinfeld and it is true"
38:28;38:34;"It's like Tommy Lee is probably more recognizable to more people than Neil Young"
38:34;38:39;"Again I don't know how that translates to money from actual music"
38:39;38:42;"More people are familiar with his whole body than Neil Young"
38:42;38:43;"There you go"
38:43;38:45;"I wonder if Methods of Mayhem"
38:45;38:46;"Do you think that's part of that deal?"
38:46;38:48;"Or do you think that was just like Tommy keeps that?"
38:48;38:52;"We'll throw in Methods of Mayhem"
38:52;38:53;"We'll throw in Get Naked"
38:53;38:56;"Listen there's probably outside of our world"
38:56;39:01;"There's probably an internet radio show some other country some other place"
39:01;39:04;"Where a bunch of people are looking at the same numbers as us and they're like"
39:04;39:09;"You're telling me Neil Young sold his catalog for more than Motley Crue?"
39:09;39:13;"Like whoa who the f*** listens to that old hippie sh*t anymore?"
39:13;39:13;"What?"
39:13;39:15;"I could totally see that"
39:15;39:19;"I'm totally bringing my subjective coastal elite taste to this"
39:19;39:21;"No doubt about it"
39:21;39:21;"I'll own that"
39:21;39:24;"I guess all of it's a little crazy"
39:24;39:25;"I wonder if they're over..."
39:25;39:29;"I mean it's like if they're making a long-term investment in this music"
39:29;39:32;"I don't think any of it is a sure bet"
39:32;39:38;"It's like what will Neil Young's music be worth in 15 years?"
39:38;39:39;"Who can possibly say?"
39:39;39:43;"It's only going to get less and less valuable with every year I would think"
39:44;39:47;"My my hey hey"
39:47;39:54;"Rock and roll is here to stay"
39:54;40:04;"It's better to burn out than to fade away"
40:04;40:09;"My my hey hey"
40:09;40:12;"What's interesting about this too is that"
40:12;40:16;"So again like my understanding what I was saying about Motley Crue"
40:16;40:20;"that I don't see this as their lawyer finessing somebody who's just like"
40:20;40:22;"""Okay you really think it's a good investment?"""
40:22;40:23;"The guy's like ""Oh absolutely"""
40:23;40:26;"I really think when people do these deals they're cracking open the books"
40:26;40:29;"These are hardcore businessmen"
40:29;40:33;"These are not like some like pie in the sky like you know"
40:33;40:35;"fun weird label guy who's like"
40:35;40:38;"""You know what f*** it I'll sign you I'll sign you for 10 million dollars"""
40:38;40:40;"You know it's not like that kind of thing"
40:40;40:43;"I think it really is pencil pushers who are looking at these numbers"
40:43;40:47;"So what I think all of this says because you know whether"
40:47;40:50;"you're a Neil Young person or a Motley Crue person"
40:50;40:54;"and I know a lot more of you are probably Motley Crue people statistically speaking"
40:54;41:01;"What all of this reflects is that the marketplace, the street, Wall Street,"
41:01;41:07;"international capital really believes that people will be listening to this 20th century music"
41:07;41:09;"for the next 100 years"
41:09;41:10;"The street has spoken"
41:10;41:14;"They believe that this is a good good long-term investment"
41:14;41:16;"It's also one of the stories like you know"
41:16;41:19;"you plant a tree for the next generation to enjoy its shade"
41:19;41:21;"The people buying this stuff now"
41:21;41:26;"they'll probably be dead before their investment turns a profit"
41:26;41:30;"but at a certain point it'll just be like the faucet will be going"
41:30;41:33;"Like once they recoup whatever they paid for all this stuff"
41:33;41:37;"then it's going to be just pure money coming in to their children and grandchildren"
41:37;41:41;"Guys, I just got a text that Morgan's available"
41:41;41:42;"Okay"
41:42;41:42;"Give him a call"
41:42;41:47;"So I to your point of the value, the market value of this"
41:47;41:51;"I have this memory of talking to Morgan about the catalog publishing stuff"
41:51;41:56;"and I feel that it's like the deluxe lifestyle thing"
41:56;41:59;"Like a catalog is like a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle"
41:59;42:01;"Is that there's something about the tangibility"
42:01;42:03;"like that you know that you have this thing"
42:03;42:06;"and the more it ages that you own something"
42:06;42:08;"or a watch, the watches that we talked about"
42:08;42:11;"the vintage cars that whoever owns this"
42:11;42:14;"it's never going to lose value"
42:14;42:18;"because it's from a time where someone crafted something"
42:18;42:23;"and then moving forward in a SoundCloud universe"
42:23;42:24;"or streaming universe"
42:24;42:25;"there just won't be as much value"
42:25;42:30;"So if you can get these big heritage catalogs that has a similar value"
42:30;42:34;"But it's still a bet because you always read these stories where somebody's like"
42:34;42:39;"this person was like the most famous songwriter of like 1905"
42:39;42:41;"We don't know a single one of their songs today"
42:41;42:43;"But you know that was a different era maybe"
42:43;42:47;"Also now these the people buying these are incentivized to keep the fire burning"
42:47;42:50;"We're not going to let Motley Crue fall off"
42:50;42:53;"All of Wall Street is now invested in Motley Crue"
42:53;42:56;"becoming the iconic band of the 80s"
42:56;42:57;"What about public domain though?"
42:57;43:00;"Isn't there a certain statute where you know after"
43:00;43:02;"what is it 125 years, 100 years?"
43:02;43:05;"Anyone can do it whatever they want"
43:05;43:06;"That's a great question actually"
43:06;43:10;"That wouldn't be true for the master because I think they could always own it"
43:10;43:13;"Well they're probably also betting that the laws will keep changing"
43:13;43:18;"Right they keep extending the the length until it becomes public domain"
43:18;43:23;"I like this universe where this huge hedge fund VC firm owns this"
43:23;43:27;"And they also own all of McDonald's"
43:28;43:32;"And so they're just pushing every it's like we gotta keep pushing Motley Crue"
43:32;43:36;"Right it's like one giant equity firm owns Motley Crue and McDonald's"
43:36;43:39;"Another one owns Poison and Burger King"
43:39;43:41;"It becomes this like weird proxy war"
43:41;43:47;"We're like yeah it's funny like Burger King is really pushing the"
43:47;43:53;"the new six-part uh Poison prestige TV drama"
43:53;43:56;"It's weird what like what does that have to do with the Burger King kids club?"
43:56;44:00;"I mean it makes no sense Burger King just keeps using unskinny bop in every ad"
44:00;44:03;"That makes no sense"
44:03;44:04;"There's a Burger King poison meal"
44:04;44:11;"Somehow it becomes like some weird like it's actually like a Chinese"
44:11;44:19;"equity firm bought the Poison catalog and an American one owns Motley Crue"
44:19;44:23;"And then like somehow some like conflict in the South China Sea"
44:24;44:27;"They fly Vince Neil out you're like how come so much of geopolitics"
44:27;44:29;"seems to revolve around these 80s hair metal bands"
44:29;44:31;"And you're like listen man"
44:31;44:31;"Vince Neil's like 70"
44:31;44:36;"Vince Neil's out there man"
44:37;44:39;"I'm about to get you so jump in"
44:39;44:45;"I can't just stand still yeah"
44:45;44:49;"I got you on the pump man"
44:49;44:55;"And leave my way to get your feel yeah"
44:55;45:00;"Every time I touch you you get hot"
45:00;45:03;"I wanna make love you never stop"
45:03;45:05;"Come up and hit it put me to the floor"
45:06;45:08;"What's been going on in here"
45:08;45:10;"Unskinny bop just blew me away"
45:10;45:12;"Unskinny bop bop on and on"
45:12;45:14;"Unskinny bop bop bop bop"
45:14;45:16;"Skinny just loves to play"
45:16;45:18;"Unskinny bop nothing more to say"
45:18;45:20;"Alright let's get Morgan on the phone I've known him for years and he works in music publishing"
45:20;45:22;"Now let's go to the time crisis"
45:22;45:24;"I'm gonna get you on the pump man"
45:34;45:36;"Time Crisis Hotline"
45:36;45:38;"*Phone Ringing*"
45:38;45:40;"Hi Ezra"
45:40;45:42;"Hi Jake"
45:42;45:44;"What's up Morgan welcome to time crisis"
45:44;45:46;"Pleasure to have you on the show"
45:46;45:48;"Alright so you're a music publisher"
45:48;45:50;"I think we more or less know what music publishing is"
45:50;45:52;"It's like song writing"
45:52;45:54;"But now ASCAP"
45:54;45:56;"What does ASCAP do"
45:56;45:58;"Are they a music publisher too"
45:58;46:00;"They collect royalties but a different type of royalties right"
46:00;46:02;"ASCAP is a performing rights organization"
46:02;46:04;"So in America"
46:04;46:06;"Their equivalent is BMI"
46:06;46:08;"And so what they're collecting"
46:08;46:10;"On behalf of song writers"
46:10;46:12;"And if a song writer has a publisher"
46:12;46:14;"Then they're collecting the publisher share"
46:14;46:16;"I'll differentiate that in a second"
46:16;46:18;"But what they're after"
46:18;46:20;"Is public performance income"
46:20;46:22;"This would be like"
46:22;46:24;"Radio airplay"
46:24;46:26;"You have a song that plays on the radio"
46:26;46:28;"You have a song that plays at the"
46:28;46:30;"Music festival"
46:30;46:32;"You have a song that plays at the"
46:32;46:34;"DSP's the digital service providers"
46:34;46:36;"You have a song that plays"
46:36;46:38;"On television whether that's"
46:38;46:40;"A synchronization with a"
46:40;46:42;"Inside of a TV show"
46:42;46:44;"Netflix"
46:44;46:46;"All of those Hulu everything"
46:46;46:48;"Pretty much so long"
46:48;46:50;"As it's not a buyout"
46:50;46:52;"Sometimes licensees"
46:52;46:54;"Will do a buyout like a Netflix"
46:54;46:56;"Will prefer to pay a little bit more money for a license"
46:56;46:58;"This has kind of gotten swatted away"
46:58;47:00;"By the industry"
47:00;47:02;"Let me get a little more specific"
47:02;47:04;"The listeners they probably have a vague sense"
47:04;47:06;"That you have music on TV"
47:06;47:08;"Music on Netflix"
47:08;47:10;"You're getting paid"
47:10;47:12;"I think what is more surprising to people"
47:12;47:14;"Is that people are getting paid when their music plays"
47:14;47:16;"In a restaurant"
47:16;47:18;"Or when it's covered in a live concert"
47:18;47:20;"The example"
47:20;47:22;"That we were talking about was"
47:22;47:24;"Vampire weekend covering Joker man"
47:24;47:26;"By Bob Dylan"
47:26;47:28;"Morgan you might not know this"
47:28;47:30;"Vampire weekend our second night at Red Rocks"
47:30;47:32;"In 2019 we covered"
47:32;47:34;"Jake's song Mountain Bruce"
47:34;47:36;"Does Jake get a little taste of that?"
47:36;47:38;"Great question"
47:38;47:40;"If Jake was to get a taste of that"
47:40;47:42;"You would have submitted a set list"
47:42;47:44;"And I believe we did"
47:44;47:46;"So if you did then Jake theoretically"
47:46;47:48;"There would be a little cash on the vine"
47:48;47:50;"Now again we're talking about a nickels and dimes"
47:50;47:52;"Space of publishing but it's where a PRO"
47:52;47:54;"Is like you know super important"
47:54;47:56;"Like literally a nickel"
47:56;47:58;"Or like $10"
47:58;48:00;"My guesstimation would be you getting your song"
48:00;48:02;"Covered at Red Rocks"
48:02;48:04;"Might be somewhere between a nickel and 10 bucks"
48:04;48:06;"Somewhere in that"
48:06;48:08;"Listen Morgan Jake's planning his future"
48:08;48:10;"Here"
48:10;48:12;"So Morgan if I wanted to"
48:12;48:14;"Hire you to collect"
48:14;48:16;"That royalty that I'm"
48:16;48:18;"Owed out of Red Rocks"
48:18;48:20;"Where is that $7.20"
48:20;48:22;"Sitting and how would"
48:22;48:24;"I get it?"
48:24;48:26;"So if you're a songwriter"
48:26;48:28;"Wants to affiliate with a performing rights organization"
48:28;48:30;"That's the first step"
48:30;48:32;"Any publisher that sort of presents themselves"
48:32;48:34;"As being a person who"
48:34;48:36;"Provides that service"
48:36;48:38;"Well you know great terrific"
48:38;48:40;"But really it's a very easy process"
48:40;48:42;"To affiliate with a PRO"
48:42;48:44;"And as a songwriter you should just"
48:44;48:46;"Take that on board yourself"
48:46;48:48;"And when doing it I think it's really important"
48:48;48:50;"That you create a publishing designee"
48:50;48:52;"A lot of times as a publisher"
48:52;48:54;"We look at a song we look for a songwriter"
48:54;48:56;"And we see no publishing"
48:56;48:58;"Designee we just see the songwriter"
48:58;49:00;"This is like"
49:00;49:02;"On ASCAP.com"
49:02;49:04;"BMI.com on their public"
49:04;49:06;"Forward facing repertoire search"
49:06;49:08;"And when you don't see a pub designee"
49:08;49:10;"That means BMI"
49:10;49:12;"And ASCAP pass the publisher"
49:12;49:14;"Share directly across to the writer"
49:14;49:16;"Which is fine you don't lose"
49:16;49:18;"Any money that way but it's really"
49:18;49:20;"Good to have a pub designee"
49:20;49:22;"Because then what happens is you kind of get"
49:22;49:24;"Two checks you get a writer share check"
49:24;49:26;"And a publisher share check"
49:26;49:28;"It sounds like Jake's getting no checks"
49:28;49:30;"Because he has no relationship with ASCAP or BMI"
49:30;49:32;"Or any kind of PRO"
49:32;49:34;"Morgan don't you have a special"
49:34;49:36;"Website you can look up"
49:36;49:38;"Like how much money is sitting around"
49:38;49:40;"For different songwriters"
49:40;49:42;"No if we had that you know that would be fantastic"
49:42;49:44;"But no that doesn't exist"
49:44;49:46;"So you can't do a quick number crunch to tell me"
49:46;49:48;"How much money Jake's leaving on the table"
49:48;49:50;"No I can't but what I can't"
49:50;49:52;"But the way that we would work backwards"
49:52;49:54;"Would be and again"
49:54;49:56;"It's really hard right now to pin"
49:56;49:58;"For instance if you have"
49:58;50:00;"A million streams on a song"
50:00;50:02;"Let's also assume you had 100%"
50:02;50:04;"Of the song right that's a very important"
50:04;50:06;"Factor. Are you the sole songwriter"
50:06;50:08;"Of Mountain Brews? No I credit"
50:08;50:10;"Everyone. Got it"
50:10;50:12;"So we're splitting the nickels"
50:12;50:14;"Well actually Mountain Brews might be just me"
50:14;50:16;"Everything later was everyone"
50:16;50:18;"Well but also Jake"
50:18;50:20;"Well Jake and I have had this kind of conversation"
50:20;50:22;"It's going to matter when you find that money"
50:22;50:24;"But Jake I think also I need to"
50:24;50:26;"Pull focus here and split two sides of it"
50:26;50:28;"I recall maybe you told me this"
50:28;50:30;"And correct me if I'm wrong but you were splitting"
50:30;50:32;"Because you put the songs up on like"
50:32;50:34;"TuneCore you know. I'm looking at my"
50:34;50:36;"TuneCore account right now. And that"
50:36;50:38;"Jake that is um that's master"
50:38;50:40;"Income because right all these guys"
50:40;50:42;"They showed up and they played with you right"
50:42;50:44;"These masters wouldn't exist"
50:44;50:46;"Without all these people's time. So you're"
50:46;50:48;"Splitting that. That's your master"
50:48;50:50;"Revenues. I see that's"
50:50;50:52;"Just okay. You're publishing"
50:52;50:54;"Which I don't think you've assigned to anybody. That is"
50:54;50:56;"Your authorship of the composition"
50:56;50:58;"Which you've written"
50:58;51:00;"100% of. Let's just say"
51:00;51:02;"Which I think is probably fair to say"
51:02;51:04;"So you know these people you know Esquib"
51:04;51:06;"Do you think if Jake linked up with one of them"
51:06;51:08;"Knowing that he's got"
51:08;51:10;"Somewhere between 5 cents and 10 dollars"
51:10;51:12;"Right there from"
51:12;51:14;"Vampire Weekend covering his song at Red Rocks"
51:14;51:16;"But also imagining that"
51:16;51:18;"You know I think Mountain Brew"
51:18;51:20;"Has probably been on some playlists that could have been"
51:20;51:22;"Played you know here and there"
51:22;51:24;"At a coffee shop or restaurant"
51:24;51:26;"So coffee shops and restaurants"
51:26;51:28;"That's impossible to track"
51:28;51:30;"Right. So what happens is you open up a"
51:30;51:32;"Coffee shop you open up a restaurant"
51:32;51:34;"It's not like you know somebody has to"
51:34;51:36;"Work overtime to submit"
51:36;51:38;"Their playlist from the previous week"
51:38;51:40;"Those are blanket licenses"
51:40;51:42;"And so ASCAP and BMI"
51:42;51:44;"Effective you know they just they bill"
51:44;51:46;"These places and say if you want to play"
51:46;51:48;"Music in this spot you know"
51:48;51:50;"You've got to pay this blanket license"
51:50;51:52;"When you fill out your license"
51:52;51:54;"They'll ask you how much revenue you make"
51:54;51:56;"How many people fit into your restaurant"
51:56;51:58;"Blah blah blah all these kind of things"
51:58;52:00;"And so you know if you're"
52:00;52:02;"Horses maybe you're"
52:02;52:04;"Busting off $600 a year to"
52:04;52:06;"Horses is a hot new restaurant in"
52:06;52:08;"LA by the way that's probably very"
52:08;52:10;"Excusing. But that does not"
52:10;52:12;"Serve horse meat. It doesn't serve"
52:12;52:14;"Horse meat. Actually we're going to pivot"
52:14;52:16;"To that in a second. But anyway so they'll pay like"
52:16;52:18;"A blanket license and then what ASCAP"
52:18;52:20;"Will do which is not dissimilar from what I"
52:20;52:22;"Will do. I will get unassigned"
52:22;52:24;"Royalties that will come in each"
52:24;52:26;"Quarter you know that really just don't"
52:26;52:28;"They've been paid to us and it's not clear"
52:28;52:30;"Who they're owed to and we"
52:30;52:32;"Me as a company we"
52:32;52:34;"Will distribute that income pro"
52:34;52:36;"Rata across our"
52:36;52:38;"Because there's a what we call a lot of dust in our"
52:38;52:40;"Business. A lot of missing"
52:40;52:42;"Nickels and dimes that don't match up. And"
52:42;52:44;"We don't want them. As a company we don't want to keep"
52:44;52:46;"Them. We don't want any liability. We don't want them. So we"
52:46;52:48;"Want to distribute them. We're going to get them off our books"
52:48;52:50;"And again you know for my company"
52:50;52:52;"Well not again but for my company which is small"
52:52;52:54;"I think last year"
52:54;52:56;"It was a very insignificant amount of money. But for"
52:56;52:58;"A very large publisher it might be in the millions"
52:58;53:00;"And it probably is certainly"
53:00;53:02;"In the millions. Millions of dollars of dust"
53:02;53:04;"Unclaimed. Unclaimed"
53:04;53:06;"And they'll distribute it on a pro rata"
53:06;53:08;"Share. So you know"
53:08;53:10;"The David Bowie estate for instance would see"
53:10;53:12;"More than Jake would see in that distribution."
53:12;53:14;"But it's definitely possible that Jake"
53:14;53:16;"Has a few thousand bucks on the table"
53:16;53:18;"Distributed all over the world."
53:18;53:20;"I want to hope so. I think the"
53:20;53:22;"First thing you do is. Here's an interesting"
53:22;53:24;"Exercise Jake. And this is the"
53:24;53:26;"Pandora's box as far as how much time you"
53:26;53:28;"Have. I think it'll take you 25 to"
53:28;53:30;"30 minutes to affiliate with"
53:30;53:32;"ASCAP or BMI. And then"
53:32;53:34;"There's a company called the MLC.com"
53:34;53:36;"Now this is some fascinating"
53:36;53:38;"All of you guys I know are occasionally on"
53:38;53:40;"Pitchfork. And you might recall"
53:40;53:42;"Like a year or so ago there was"
53:42;53:44;"A ton of news on the music press about how"
53:44;53:46;"There was you know 750 million"
53:46;53:48;"Or whatever hundreds of millions of dollars"
53:48;53:50;"In unclaimed"
53:50;53:52;"Mechanical income. And"
53:52;53:54;"What it was is if you didn't"
53:54;53:56;"Have a publisher from the time"
53:56;53:58;"That the DSPs kickstarted. Apple"
53:58;54:00;"iTunes. All of these things."
54:00;54:02;"Or at least have an astute enough"
54:02;54:04;"Manager or business manager"
54:04;54:06;"Collecting on your behalf. All"
54:06;54:08;"The mechanical royalties"
54:08;54:10;"That were accrued on behalf of"
54:10;54:12;"Writers who didn't have a"
54:12;54:14;"Publisher or someone looking for them"
54:14;54:16;"Went to a black box."
54:16;54:18;"And it was an astounding"
54:18;54:20;"Amount of money. Now"
54:20;54:22;"Mind you. Performance"
54:22;54:24;"Mechanical income combined. If you have"
54:24;54:26;"A million streams. You might be"
54:26;54:28;"Talking about $250"
54:28;54:30;"To $500"
54:30;54:32;"Depending on how that person. Whether"
54:32;54:34;"It's a YouTube. It's very hard to"
54:34;54:36;"Pinpoint. But the point is"
54:36;54:38;"A million dollars. You're talking about a"
54:38;54:40;"Few hundred dollars. And if"
54:40;54:42;"You had a hundred percent of the song. But"
54:42;54:44;"Imagine all of the people"
54:44;54:46;"Threw up so much music."
54:46;54:48;"And to get it up on the board"
54:48;54:50;"It's not as if they had to have like"
54:50;54:52;"The entire song monetized."
54:52;54:54;"I.e. a label. I.e."
54:54;54:56;"Every songwriter having a publisher."
54:56;54:58;"They just. Based on"
54:58;55:00;"Whatever"
55:00;55:02;"Distributions. Copyright boards"
55:02;55:04;"Or whatever their deals were"
55:04;55:06;"With labels or publishers or whatever."
55:06;55:08;"They just knew that each time"
55:08;55:10;"A stream happened on this DSP"
55:10;55:12;"Or within that DSP"
55:12;55:14;"This tier or that tier"
55:14;55:16;"X amount of money goes to the songwriter"
55:16;55:18;"And X amount of money goes to the label"
55:18;55:20;"Or the owner or the master."
55:20;55:22;"And they don't know who to send it to."
55:22;55:24;"It goes to a black box."
55:24;55:26;"And they had so much money."
55:26;55:28;"And so in America"
55:28;55:30;"A coalition of publishers got together"
55:30;55:32;"And started a thing called the MLC"
55:32;55:34;"The Mechanical Licensing Collective"
55:34;55:36;"I think is what it stands for."
55:36;55:38;"The. Like the word the."
55:38;55:40;"MLC.com"
55:40;55:42;"And you can go on that. Just like you"
55:42;55:44;"Can go on ASCAP or BMI or CSAC"
55:44;55:46;"And you can look."
55:46;55:48;"And you can see."
55:48;55:50;"Anyone can. This is like not"
55:50;55:52;"This is kind of seen as publisher"
55:52;55:54;"Juju but this is not. This is some"
55:54;55:56;"Straight up. Anyone can do this."
55:56;55:58;"So this is what I meant before. Can't we just like"
55:58;56:00;"Look up Mountain Brews?"
56:00;56:02;"Well we can look up to see if Jake is affiliated"
56:02;56:04;"But we can't look up and just see a number"
56:04;56:06;"Next to it and go hey there's $80 here waiting."
56:06;56:08;"That feature doesn't exist."
56:08;56:10;"No matches found on Mountain Brews."
56:10;56:12;"I'm putting in my name."
56:12;56:14;"Well it's giving me a lot of songs called Brews."
56:14;56:16;"Guys I have 120 seconds"
56:16;56:18;"And then I gotta go do some math with my daughter."
56:18;56:20;"But all of this"
56:20;56:22;"I'm telling you these details"
56:22;56:24;"This is just America."
56:24;56:26;"This is just for revenue generated in America."
56:26;56:28;"So Canada"
56:28;56:30;"Instead of the MLC they have the CMRRA."
56:30;56:32;"You know Germany's got"
56:32;56:34;"A mechanical collection society."
56:34;56:36;"France does too. And that's in addition to"
56:36;56:38;"The PROs I mentioned."
56:38;56:40;"So it all adds up."
56:40;56:42;"And also my Pandora's box comment"
56:42;56:44;"To Jake. He can go"
56:44;56:46;"Affiliate with ASCAP and BMI."
56:46;56:48;"And he can go to the MLC and he can affiliate there too."
56:48;56:50;"But he's just at that point"
56:50;56:52;"Got the 50 states covered."
56:52;56:54;"He doesn't have the rest of the world."
56:54;56:56;"However he might just get that Red Rocks bread."
56:56;56:58;"That would have originated in America."
56:58;57:00;"Yeah I know we did cover"
57:00;57:02;"Can you help us track down"
57:02;57:04;"Jake's Red Rock bread?"
57:04;57:06;"I can't."
57:06;57:08;"Okay get on it. We'll return to this on another episode."
57:08;57:10;"I feel like I did license with one of them."
57:10;57:12;"When you upload stuff to Bandcamp"
57:12;57:14;"Or TuneCore I feel like they"
57:14;57:16;"I could be misremembering."
57:16;57:18;"I don't know either. I forget."
57:18;57:20;"I honestly don't remember."
57:20;57:22;"We gotta do some research. I know we did play"
57:22;57:24;"Mountain Bruise or at least part of it"
57:24;57:26;"In Germany."
57:26;57:28;"A couple other shows I remember."
57:28;57:30;"Alright. Well Seinfeld pack your sh*t"
57:30;57:32;"We're flying out to Germany tomorrow."
57:32;57:34;"We need to come back with Jake's money."
57:34;57:36;"I'm ready."
57:36;57:38;"Alright well thanks so much Morrie."
57:38;57:40;"Thanks for calling in."
57:40;57:42;"It's an honor. I hope that wasn't too boring."
57:42;57:44;"No man."
57:44;57:46;"I'm not a fan of the show."
01:43:56;01:43:58;"If you had a girl that told you that"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"she also did corporate food history,"
01:44:00;01:44:02;"would you have been excited?"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"Or would you have been"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"sort of like, ""Oh no."""
01:44:06;01:44:08;"I would be excited because"
01:44:08;01:44:10;"I like Dua Lipa. I'm a fan."
01:44:10;01:44:12;"And I'd be like, ""You know what?"
01:44:12;01:44:14;"She's going to bring corporate food history"
01:44:14;01:44:16;"to a bigger audience than we could."
01:44:16;01:44:18;"And, you know, we're all doing God's work."""
01:44:18;01:44:20;"That's how I'd feel."
01:44:20;01:44:22;"I mean, is it fair to call somebody"
01:44:22;01:44:24;"who's never been on the show a friend of the show?"
01:44:24;01:44:26;"I'm sure."
01:44:28;01:44:30;"Because you feel like Dua Lipa is a friend of the show,"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"even though she's never been on the show?"
01:44:32;01:44:34;"Yeah."
01:44:34;01:44:36;"Any musician who hosts"
01:44:36;01:44:38;"an internet radio show"
01:44:38;01:44:40;"or podcast is automatically a friend of the show."
01:44:40;01:44:42;"Correct."
01:44:42;01:44:44;"They understand my struggle."
01:44:44;01:44:46;"Dua Lipa has to tell her"
01:44:46;01:44:48;"press people that they need to release"
01:44:48;01:44:50;"an announcement saying,"
01:44:50;01:44:52;"""I am not a friend of the show."""
01:44:54;01:44:56;"I am unequivocally not a friend of the show."
01:44:56;01:44:58;"I would say that Elton John's a friend of the show"
01:44:58;01:45:00;"because I went on his"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"Apple Music internet radio show."
01:45:02;01:45:04;"You did?"
01:45:04;01:45:06;"Yeah."
01:45:06;01:45:08;"When?"
01:45:08;01:45:10;"It was like Father of the Bride era."
01:45:10;01:45:12;"2019?"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"Yeah, it was 2019. He couldn't have been nicer."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"In person or phone?"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"No, I was on the phone."
01:45:18;01:45:20;"First of all, he really did his homework."
01:45:20;01:45:22;"He clearly had some notes."
01:45:22;01:45:24;"He had really nice things to say about"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"the album."
01:45:26;01:45:28;"He said Father of the Bride was his favorite album of the year"
01:45:28;01:45:30;"so far."
01:45:30;01:45:32;"I think I talked to him in June of that year."
01:45:32;01:45:34;"I meant to check in with him"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"early the next year."
01:45:36;01:45:38;"Then due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I forgot about it."
01:45:38;01:45:40;"But I"
01:45:40;01:45:42;"say, ""Hey Elton, I know"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"a lot of time has passed."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"Did that make it to the end?"""
01:45:46;01:45:48;"I have a bad feeling it didn't."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"Matt, can we get Elton"
01:45:50;01:45:52;"John on the phone real quick?"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"Right now?"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"Yeah, let's see if he picks up."
01:45:56;01:45:58;"He's probably sleeping. He's probably in a different"
01:45:58;01:46:00;"time zone."
01:46:00;01:46:02;"My understanding is that Elton John's show is"
01:46:02;01:46:04;"the longest running"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"Apple Music show and"
01:46:06;01:46:08;"Time Crisis is only second to Elton"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"John's show. Is that"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"correct? Matt is shaking his head."
01:46:12;01:46:14;"I'm completely incorrect on that."
01:46:14;01:46:16;"Nobody knows."
01:46:16;01:46:18;"The longest running."
01:46:18;01:46:20;"One thing that stands out to me"
01:46:20;01:46:22;"is that he said, which was tight,"
01:46:22;01:46:24;"he really"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"listens to music. He really was familiar"
01:46:26;01:46:28;"with the record because at some point he said,"
01:46:28;01:46:30;"""I heard you're a father now."""
01:46:30;01:46:32;"""Oh yeah, we had a baby last year."""
01:46:32;01:46:34;"He goes, ""Is that what Bambina's about?"""
01:46:34;01:46:36;"I was like,"
01:46:36;01:46:38;"""Oh, no."""
01:46:38;01:46:40;"I didn't want to get into the weeds on it."
01:46:40;01:46:42;"I was like, ""Yeah, no."""
01:46:42;01:46:44;"I wasn't thinking that."
01:46:44;01:46:46;"Anyway, shout out to Elton John. That's tight."
01:46:46;01:46:48;"Great guy. Friend of the show."
01:46:48;01:46:50;"Friend of the show."
01:46:50;01:46:52;"Elton John puts out a statement. He's like,"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"""I reserve the right to call you a friend of the"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"show, although I wouldn't now,"
01:46:56;01:46:58;"but I'm certainly not a friend of your show."""
01:46:58;01:47:00;"How dare you?"
01:47:00;01:47:02;"Joint statement from Dua Lipa and Elton John."
01:47:02;01:47:04;"I've been in this"
01:47:04;01:47:06;"business a long time, kid."
01:47:06;01:47:08;"I mean,"
01:47:08;01:47:10;"it's very, you know, we could do"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"something for them, but they can do nothing for us."
01:47:12;01:47:14;"Are you thirsting more?"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"It's very thirsting."
01:47:16;01:47:18;"I'd love to revisit that, actually."
01:47:18;01:47:20;"I've thought a lot about..."
01:47:20;01:47:22;"That was an episode of Time Crisis that I really"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"took back into my own week."
01:47:24;01:47:26;"You know, because sometimes we'll talk"
01:47:26;01:47:28;"about some sh*t like, you know,"
01:47:28;01:47:30;"I'll promise that I'm going to drink Folgers for two weeks"
01:47:30;01:47:32;"and I instantly forget about it. I'm not going to forget this time."
01:47:32;01:47:34;"The next two weeks, I'm going hard on Folgers."
01:47:34;01:47:36;"But, you know,"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"just because I enjoy talking"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"about it with you guys,"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"you know, other people in my life,"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"it's not going to come up where I'm going to be like..."
01:47:44;01:47:46;"Just like"
01:47:46;01:47:48;"talking to some other friends or family"
01:47:48;01:47:50;"and just be like, ""You guys check out the new"
01:47:50;01:47:52;"Folgers ad campaign?"""
01:47:52;01:47:54;"Yikes. What do you think about this whole New Orleans"
01:47:54;01:47:56;"thing? I mean, come on, it's just the roastery."
01:47:56;01:47:58;"Like, it's not going to come up."
01:47:58;01:48:00;"It's very unlikely to come up."
01:48:00;01:48:02;"Not going to come up. Whereas there was something"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"about Thirst and More talking about fish that"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"actually I wanted to keep talking about it with people."
01:48:06;01:48:08;"You know, whether it's like talking with a CT"
01:48:08;01:48:10;"who's like an OG fish fan."
01:48:10;01:48:12;"Or just like other people I knew"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"who maybe had met Thirst and More"
01:48:14;01:48:16;"or Grateful Dead."
01:48:16;01:48:18;"That one just came up a lot. I thought about it a lot."
01:48:18;01:48:20;"Just like, ""Hey, you guys..."""
01:48:20;01:48:22;"Just making a small, ""You know about this? Thirst and More"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"kind of thought that they were going to be the next fish"

01:48:26;01:48:28;"Ezra, I love you"

01:48:38;01:48:40;"Basically I'm going to spend my two weeks"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"I'm going to drink Folgers."" And people around the party"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"are like, ""Wow, what a quirky guy."""

01:48:54;01:48:56;"exclusively drink Folgers for the next two weeks."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"I'll just never reference Time Crisis."
01:48:58;01:49:00;"I think that's what I should do when I meet"

01:49:10;01:49:12;"I'll just reference Time Crisis stuff, but"
01:49:12;01:49:14;"no zero context."
01:49:14;01:49:16;"Matt did a number crunch."
01:49:16;01:49:18;"TC and Elton John"
01:49:18;01:49:20;"both started the same week, their shows."

01:49:28;01:49:30;"Yeah, there's another show called Soul Election"

01:50:22;01:50:24;"I didn't even think about it. It's like a Tim Robinson"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"level. You know what's funny? I didn't even think about"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"it. I immediately started doing my bad"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"Tim Robinson impression because..."
01:50:30;01:50:32;"Yeah, it's that guy. He's the king"

01:50:36;01:50:38;"Yeah, I probably should go"

01:50:40;01:50:42;"I'm worried if they're going to sell out"

01:50:46;01:50:48;"Folgers says, ""Damn now."" So,"
01:50:48;01:50:50;"yeah, I think"
01:50:50;01:50:52;"a lot of younger people are going to get in the Folgers game."

01:50:56;01:51:00;"and I got a little bit of egg on my face, uh, due to the whole New Orleans roastery thing."
01:51:00;01:51:08;"All right, the number two song 1969, Creedence Clearwater Revival, ""Proud Mary."""
01:51:08;01:51:13;"Classic."
01:51:13;01:51:33;"That accent, ""waken,"" yeah, ""waken."""
01:51:37;01:51:43;"Oh, actually, John Fogerty referred to that. He said that was a funky pronunciation he got"
01:51:43;01:51:51;"from Howlin' Wolf. I guess Howlin' Wolf would say ""waken,"" ""boinin."" Sounds like New York."
01:51:51;01:51:52;"That's so funny."
01:51:52;01:52:00;"What'd he say about New Orleans?"
01:52:01;01:52:08;"Uncle Otto. The Folgers Roastery down in New Orleans."
01:52:08;01:52:14;"Wait, hold on. That song, didn't he say ""big wheel keep on boinin""? Here, back up."

01:52:17;01:52:19;"""Proud Mary keep on boinin."""
01:52:19;01:52:26;"Did it? Sounds like he said ""big wheel keep on boinin."""
01:52:26;01:52:26;"Yeah, yeah, you're right."
01:52:26;01:52:29;"He messed up. The ""big wheel keeps on toinin."""
