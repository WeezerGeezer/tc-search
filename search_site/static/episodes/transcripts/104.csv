00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:03;00:06;"We're joined by friend of the show Kazzy David."
00:06;00:09;"And we discuss all sorts of stuff."
00:09;00:11;"My recent trip to Mexico."
00:11;00:13;"My new favorite candy."
00:13;00:18;"All this, plus a deep exploration of the BJU."
00:18;00:19;"What does that stand for?"
00:19;00:21;"Well, you're about to find out."
00:21;00:24;"This is yet another..."
00:24;00:28;"Time Crisis with Eds Ronkainen."
00:28;00:31;"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sporting One."
00:32;00:36;"They passed me by"
00:36;00:40;"All of those great romances"
00:40;00:43;"They were a threat, probably"
00:43;00:47;"All my rightful chances"
00:47;00:50;"But picture clear"
00:50;00:54;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:54;00:58;"And so I dealt to the blow"
00:58;01:01;"One of us had to go"
01:01;01:06;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:06;01:09;"One of us is crying"
01:09;01:12;"One of us is lying"
01:12;01:16;"Leave that on me, babe"
01:16;01:18;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:18;01:19;"What's up, Jake?"
01:19;01:21;"Not much. How are you?"
01:21;01:24;"Pretty good."
01:24;01:26;"A little stiff out of the gate, I'm sorry."
01:26;01:28;"This is our first kind of back to normal show."
01:28;01:29;"Right."
01:29;01:32;"Time Crisis went in a real star-studded direction."
01:32;01:33;"Heavy duty."
01:33;01:36;"Wait, was that back to back, Justin Vernon and into Huey Lewis?"
01:36;01:37;"Mm-hmm."
01:37;01:40;"That was Celeb Month."
01:40;01:41;"On TC."
01:41;01:46;"No, it's just back to the scrubs, ham and egging it."
01:46;01:48;"I've never heard that phrase before."
01:48;01:49;"Really?"
01:49;01:50;"Just to mean like back to basics?"
01:50;01:51;"Yeah, like a ham and egger."
01:51;01:53;"I think it's like a baseball player term."
01:53;01:56;"Just like a real kind of--"
01:56;01:57;"What, it's like meat and potatoes?"
01:57;01:58;"Yeah, ham and egger."
01:58;01:59;"It's the same thing?"
01:59;02:00;"Yeah."
02:00;02:04;"He's a real ham and egg type guy or is it specifically a ham and egger?"
02:04;02:05;"Am I making this up?"
02:05;02:07;"I feel like I've heard ham and egger."
02:07;02:11;"Ham and egger, a common person who might be seen eating ham and eggs."
02:11;02:12;"There you go."
02:12;02:16;"Not possessing many spectacular qualities, your average Joe."
02:16;02:18;"Going to sign off on that."
02:18;02:21;"I just feel like people say meat and potatoes like all the time."
02:21;02:22;"Right."
02:22;02:23;"Ham and egger."
02:23;02:25;"It doesn't roll off the tongue really."
02:25;02:27;"Ham and egger."
02:27;02:28;"There's a guy, Dave Eggers."
02:28;02:29;"True."
02:29;02:32;"Never read any of his books, but people are into him."
02:32;02:34;"We got Kazzy David stopping by."
02:34;02:37;"But you know, once somebody's been on the show more than once,"
02:37;02:38;"they become a friend of the show."
02:38;02:39;"Right."
02:39;02:42;"But if they've only been once, they're executive platinum."
02:42;02:46;"So if Huey or Justin comes back, they actually get downgraded."
02:46;02:49;"Or upgra-- yeah, in a way."
02:49;02:52;"Lady Gaga recently tweeted fame is a prison."
02:52;02:53;"That's deep."
02:53;02:54;"There's two ways to look at it."
02:54;02:58;"This is kind of what the Vampire Weekend song Rich Man is about in a way."
02:58;03:01;"It's kind of like the higher you go, the higher your status is."
03:01;03:04;"Yeah, you're winning a higher status, but you're also losing something."
03:04;03:08;"So, you know, I bet Justin and Huey, they're pretty down to earth guys."
03:08;03:12;"If we told them, guys, right now you have a very rare status in the show."
03:12;03:14;"You're both executive platinum."
03:14;03:16;"You've only ever been on the show once."
03:16;03:18;"And they'd be like, well, what are the other levels?"
03:18;03:20;"And we'd be like, well, you know, it's low key."
03:20;03:21;"It's like friend of the show."
03:21;03:24;"I bet those guys would be like, I want to be a friend of the show."
03:24;03:25;"I'm not a god."
03:25;03:27;"You'd rather spend more time with us."
03:27;03:28;"Yeah."
03:28;03:31;"Than maintain your executive platinum status."
03:31;03:32;"I think so."
03:32;03:34;"That's like a really human tradeoff."
03:34;03:35;"Yeah."
03:35;03:36;"What if I quit the show right now?"
03:36;03:37;"Yeah."
03:37;03:39;"What would my status be?"
03:39;03:41;"It would be former co-host."
03:41;03:42;"Well, you would have--"
03:42;03:45;"But if I keep doing the show--"
03:45;03:50;"Well, first of all, all those hours you logged out the window, non-transferable."
03:50;03:52;"That's true."
03:52;03:54;"Nowhere near 10,000."
03:54;03:55;"You're like a permanent friend."
03:55;03:57;"Oh, no, what do we call it?"
03:57;03:58;"Time crisis inner circle?"
03:58;04:00;"I feel like we've referred to it on the show."
04:00;04:01;"Core crew."
04:01;04:02;"Oh, yeah, core crew."
04:02;04:04;"You could be former core crew then."
04:04;04:05;"Yeah."
04:44;04:45;"How was Mexico?"
04:45;04:46;"Oh, yeah, Mexico was tight."
04:46;04:47;"Yeah."
04:47;04:49;"Just been a week down there."
04:49;04:50;"Sounds fun."
04:50;04:53;"I don't know why this terrible phrase always pops into my head."
04:53;04:58;"It must be from a song or something that I feel like people sometimes say, ""Down Mexico Way."""
04:58;04:59;"Does that sound familiar?"
04:59;05:00;"Yeah, they like a song."
05:00;05:01;"It's like a thing."
05:01;05:05;"Is it like a '60s kind of Jay and the Americans kind of song?"
05:05;05:06;"Maybe."
05:06;05:07;"Down Mexico Way."
05:07;05:12;"There's a 1941 American Western film called ""Down Mexico Way,"" so maybe that's the start of it."
05:12;05:13;"Huh, all right."
05:13;05:14;"Is that a phrase?"
05:14;05:19;"Would you be like-- you'd be in Connecticut and be like, ""We're going down Jersey Way, down Florida Way?"""
05:19;05:22;"I feel like if you were going south, you would say ""down."""
05:22;05:24;"But you can't be like, ""I'm going up Seattle Way."""
05:24;05:28;"I mean, I hear people confuse this all the time, like, ""Oh, I'm going down to the Bay Area."""
05:28;05:29;"Seriously?"
05:29;05:30;"Well, people don't say that, actually."
05:30;05:34;"But I have heard people say, like, ""Reverse the north-south direction,"" and it drives me crazy."
05:34;05:40;"That's the type of one I feel like on the show we've had discussions before about when is it appropriate to care about something."
05:40;05:41;"Right."
05:41;05:42;"Actually, that was an exchange we had once."
05:42;05:48;"I said I was telling you how some people get mad when somebody says ""ATM machine"" because the ""M"" stands for ""machine."""
05:48;05:51;"So you're basically saying automatic teller machine machine."
05:51;05:53;"And you ironically-- I think you were being sarcastic."
05:53;05:56;"You said, ""That's a cool thing to get mad about."""
05:56;05:58;"I was being completely sincere."
05:58;06:03;"That is a very cool thing to get mad about."
06:03;06:06;"I'm picturing going back to that conversation."
06:06;06:16;"You're just watching two people talk, like, me, you, and Seinfeld, and Seinfeld says, ""Hey, guys, I just got to go get some currency out of the ATM machine."""
06:16;06:19;"And I'm like, ""Seinfeld, the 'M' stands for 'machine.'"
06:19;06:20;"Just say 'ATM.'"""
06:20;06:24;"And you're standing there going, ""Very cool."""
06:24;06:25;"""Nice."
06:25;06:27;"You, like, give me a pound."""
06:27;06:29;"Hell yeah, dude."
06:29;06:30;"Hell yeah."
06:30;06:33;"And Seinfeld's like, ""Jager, are you being sarcastic?"""
06:33;06:34;"""Not at all."
06:34;06:35;"ATM."
06:35;06:36;"Get the f--- out of here."""
06:38;06:39;"Rough stuff."
06:39;06:41;"So down Mexico way--"
06:41;06:48;"Oh, but I was going to say, that is one where I'm just like, if somebody's in L.A. and they straight up said, ""Oh, yeah, I'm going down to the Bay."
06:48;06:52;"I'm going down to San Francisco,"" I would find it hard to not say anything."
06:52;06:54;"You'd be like, ""Up, north."""
06:54;06:55;"That's crazy."
06:55;06:56;"Yeah, I've definitely heard--"
06:56;06:59;"Wait, what if they're from Australia or the Southern Hemisphere?"
06:59;07:00;"Yeah, mate."
07:00;07:01;"Oh, right."
07:01;07:03;"Mate, I'm going down it, down Australia."
07:03;07:04;"You're going up to Australia."
07:04;07:06;"Oh, depends how you look at it, mate."
07:06;07:07;"Oh, that's a really bad one."
07:07;07:08;"Sorry."
07:08;07:10;"I'll just do it in an American accent."
07:10;07:13;"Hey, mate, I'm going down Frisco way."
07:13;07:15;"You're going up to San Francisco."
07:15;07:19;"And now I'm going down, just like I came down to L.A."
07:19;07:20;"You know, why not?"
07:20;07:21;"Yeah, man."
07:21;07:22;"Maybe it's not appropriate to get mad about."
07:22;07:24;"Anyway, I've said it before."
07:24;07:28;"We have a real connection to our fans in Mexico, some of the most dedicated fans in the world."
07:28;07:31;"It's one of the only places where people wait at the airport for us."
07:31;07:33;"Wow, Beatles style."
07:33;07:37;"If anybody was doing that in the U.S., I'd just be like, ""What the f---?"""
07:37;07:41;"But, yeah, when we pulled in Mexico City, it was like 30 people."
07:41;07:42;"Wow."
07:42;07:43;"We're getting gifts and stuff."
07:43;07:44;"Just like by baggage claim?"
07:44;07:47;"Like you exit customs and they're standing right there with signs?"
07:47;07:49;"Well, it's past baggage claim."
07:49;07:50;"Okay."
07:50;07:52;"But, yeah, it's the last thing before you get to your car."
07:52;07:53;"Wow."
07:53;07:54;"That's amazing."
07:54;07:56;"We did two festivals, Guadalajara and Monterey."
07:56;07:58;"Those were both really good."
07:58;08:03;"And then we did our first ever headline shows in Mexico City because it's always been festivals."
08:03;08:09;"So, we did two nights at a place called the Teatro Metropolitan, which is in the film Roma."
08:09;08:10;"Oh, cool."
08:10;08:11;"So, it's like a beautiful old theater."
08:11;08:12;"Yeah, it used to be a movie theater."
08:12;08:13;"Wow."
08:13;08:15;"Yeah, so the shows were great."
08:15;08:16;"Great fans."
08:16;08:18;"Maybe one of the loudest crowds ever."
08:18;08:20;"Night one was extremely loud."
08:20;08:21;"Ask Morgan."
08:21;08:22;"He came down Mexico way."
08:22;08:23;"That's right."
08:23;08:24;"Morgan called me."
08:24;08:25;"He's like, ""Hey, buddy."
08:25;08:26;"I'm going down Mexico way."
08:26;08:27;"You want to come?"""
08:27;08:28;"I'm like, ""Oh, man."
08:28;08:29;"I can't go down Mexico way."
08:29;08:30;"I'm busy."""
08:30;08:31;"I can't pull it off, Morgan."
08:31;08:32;"I can't make a run for the border."
08:32;08:33;"South of the border, down Mexico way."
08:33;08:34;"That's where I fell in love when stars above came out to play."
08:34;08:58;"Now as I wander, my thoughts ever stray."
08:58;09:11;"South of the border, down Mexico way."
09:11;09:20;"She was a picture in old Spanish lace."
09:20;09:39;"For a tender while I kissed the smile on her face."
09:39;09:45;"For it was fiesta."
09:45;09:46;"We were so gay."
09:46;09:47;"South of the border, down Mexico way."
09:47;09:48;"I just love being in Mexico."
09:48;09:49;"Mexico City is so tight."
09:49;09:50;"I'm not going to get out of here."
09:50;09:51;"I'm going to get out of here."
10:08;10:31;"I'm going to get out of here."
10:31;10:59;"I'm going to get out of here."
10:59;11:02;"I'm going to get out of here."
11:02;11:03;"I'm going to get out of here."
13:04;13:06;"This is the time crisis, Sweet Chili Heat."
13:06;13:10;"Sweet Chili Heat, world premiere, brought to you by Doritos, Sweet Chili Heat."
13:10;13:13;"It's a Mexican candy called Pulparindo."
13:13;13:15;"Maybe it's more like Pulparindo."
13:15;13:16;"Uh-huh."
13:16;13:17;"You guys know it?"
13:17;13:18;"No, I don't know it."
13:18;13:19;"No."
13:19;13:20;"Kazzy David just entered the building."
13:20;13:21;"Hello."
13:21;13:24;"You know there's a lot of tamarind candy in Mexico?"
13:24;13:25;"What's tamarind?"
13:25;13:26;"Sorry."
13:26;13:27;"I guess tamarind is a fruit."
13:27;13:32;"The way it looks on the outside when you see raw tamarind, it's got this kind of like"
13:32;13:36;"beige, brown covering, and it's got like seeds."
13:36;13:41;"But when you mix it with sugar and you make it sweet, it kind of becomes like a lot of"
13:41;13:45;"tamarind paste in Central and South American candy."
13:45;13:48;"It's kind of like a tangy, fruity, tropical flavor."
13:48;13:49;"Okay."
13:49;13:54;"But then tamarindo, it truly is one of the most sophisticated flavor palettes of any"
13:54;13:56;"major candy, at least in North America."
13:56;13:57;"Is it sold north of the border?"
13:57;13:58;"Well, of course."
13:58;14:00;"I mean, could you get this candy at like..."
14:00;14:03;"Oh, I'm sure in LA you could find it in all sorts of places."
14:03;14:04;"But are you going to find it..."
14:04;14:08;"Well, just because, you know, obviously Mexican food and Mexican culture is a part of the"
14:08;14:09;"US."
14:09;14:10;"Of course."
14:10;14:14;"Are you going to find it in a super gringo neighborhood right next to the Almond Joy?"
14:14;14:15;"Maybe not."
14:15;14:20;"I would estimate in America, you're never more than 25 miles from a tamarindo."
14:20;14:23;"Are you going to start incorporating this into your regular diet?"
14:23;14:25;"Well, no, because it's candy."
14:25;14:26;"Okay."
14:26;14:28;"So your favorite candy is poporindo?"
14:28;14:29;"Yeah."
14:29;14:32;"It's spicy, salty, sweet and tangy all at the same time."
14:32;14:33;"Sounds so bad."
14:33;14:37;"Ezra, did you try the extra hot poporindo by any chance?"
14:37;14:38;"I didn't come across it."
14:38;14:39;"Okay."
14:39;14:40;"That's good."
14:40;14:41;"But I would."
14:41;14:43;"That's very good because apparently the California Department of Public Health determined that"
14:43;14:50;"the extra hot variety contained between 0.12 and 0.18 ppm of lead in it, which is above"
14:50;14:53;"the acceptable limit for small children to eat."
14:53;14:57;"And you're not a small child, but probably no one should be eating that much lead."
14:57;14:59;"But that's only the extra spicy?"
14:59;15:02;"That's the sweet chili heat poporindo."
15:02;15:05;"And also, I think it's such a common candy."
15:05;15:10;"So anybody Mexican who's listening is like, yeah, all right, you tasted like a starburst."
15:10;15:12;"You know, it's just like very, very common."
15:12;15:14;"It's a really sophisticated flavor palette."
15:14;15:18;"I remember the first time I ever had it like 10, 15 years ago, I was a little bit like,"
15:18;15:22;"whoa, because it's a sophisticated flavor palette that's a little bit alien to maybe"
15:22;15:24;"certain gringo sensibilities."
15:24;15:28;"But anyways, after two or three, you're like, you know what, this is my favorite thing ever."
15:28;15:32;"Is it manufactured by a major snack food corporation or is it?"
15:32;15:34;"Yes, I believe it's De La Rosa, right, Seinfeld?"
15:34;15:36;"So you can't make your own version of it."
15:36;15:38;"It's like a brand."
15:38;15:39;"You're right, it is."
15:39;15:40;"But what is De La Rosa?"
15:40;15:43;"De La Rosa is a major candy company down Mexico way."
15:43;15:44;"Oh, down Mexico way."
15:44;15:46;"Who owns De La Rosa though?"
15:46;15:47;"Let's see here."
15:47;15:48;"Viacom."
15:48;15:50;"A Brazilian comrade."
15:50;15:53;"Sumner Redstone."
15:53;15:55;"Elon Musk."
15:55;16:00;"You know, you go to De La Rosa on Wikipedia and it does that disambiguation thing where"
16:00;16:03;"it goes to like 47 different De La Rosas."
16:03;16:06;"Oh yeah, because there must be so many with the last name and stuff."
16:06;16:07;"Is that of the Rose?"
16:07;16:09;"Yeah, of the Rose, that's right."
16:09;16:10;"Do you speak Spanish?"
16:10;16:11;"Yeah."
16:11;16:12;"Have you been down Mexico way?"
16:12;16:15;"Yeah, I've been down there, Mexico way."
16:15;16:19;"Have you been to Mexico City or you go on like a resort?"
16:19;16:22;"I've been to Cabo."
16:22;16:24;"You need to go to Mexico City."
16:24;16:26;"Yeah, no, definitely."
16:26;16:28;"It's the new place I heard."
16:28;16:30;"I think people are kind of..."
16:30;16:31;"A lot of people are going down there."
16:31;16:32;"Going down Mexico way?"
16:32;16:33;"Yeah."
16:33;16:35;"It might be the best city in North America."
16:35;16:37;"Is it the oldest of the major cities?"
16:37;16:38;"I think it's the biggest."
16:38;16:39;"It's pretty old."
16:39;16:44;"Well, I remember there's a weird mix of like ancient like Aztec stuff and then like colonial"
16:44;16:45;"Spanish stuff."
16:45;16:49;"In the States, you don't really get the like remnants of the civilizations that were here"
16:49;16:51;"like a thousand years ago."
16:51;16:54;"Like in like Omaha, there's not like a temple."
16:54;16:58;"Yeah, because the pyramids that are just outside of Mexico City, because yeah, Mexico City"
16:58;17:03;"is ultimately the place where it's built was part of the Aztec civilization."
17:03;17:09;"So it's ancient and you go out to the pyramids and these structures and it's like really"
17:09;17:13;"intense and you know, like the sun hits at the right angle and there's all this very"
17:13;17:16;"sophisticated physics and astronomy going on."
17:16;17:20;"Is there anything like that in North America or just the indigenous people weren't using"
17:20;17:22;"that type of building material?"
17:22;17:23;"Yeah, I don't think there is."
17:23;17:26;"There's like the caves in like New Mexico, but obviously that's."
17:26;17:27;"Oh yeah, yeah, right."
17:27;17:30;"There's not like a temple, right?"
17:30;17:33;"It would make the texture of life different, right?"
17:33;17:35;"If there was like an ancient temple."
17:35;17:37;"We have like old Hollywood."
17:37;17:38;"Right."
17:38;17:39;"We got Musso and Franks."
17:39;17:41;"We got once upon a time in Hollywood."
17:41;17:43;"Well, yeah, that's a good question."
17:43;17:49;"If there were more of these permanent structures, obviously the average American knows that"
17:49;17:51;"we live on stolen land."
17:51;17:52;"Yeah."
17:52;17:53;"But would it like."
17:53;17:54;"Of course we know that."
17:54;17:55;"Did you not know that?"
17:55;17:56;"No, I didn't."
17:56;18:00;"Yeah, but there's no physical remnant to like remind us."
18:00;18:01;"Right."
18:01;18:06;"No, we have Columbus Day every year and all of the tweets that come on that day about"
18:06;18:07;"how we're on stolen land."
18:07;18:09;"Well, Kaz, how old are you now?"
18:09;18:10;"I'm 25."
18:10;18:11;"So."
18:11;18:13;"I'm not ashamed of my age here."
18:13;18:14;"No, no, you shouldn't be."
18:14;18:19;"But I feel like when I was like in middle school or high school, they still just kind"
18:19;18:22;"of tried out Columbus Day with like not a whole lot of pushback."
18:22;18:27;"Like you kind of knew it wasn't like a foreign concept that, oh, Columbus maybe wasn't so"
18:27;18:29;"great, but there was still, you know, whatever."
18:29;18:30;"It's Columbus Day."
18:30;18:34;"By the time you were like in high school, was Columbus already kind of canceled?"
18:34;18:37;"He was on the way to getting canceled, I would say for sure."
18:37;18:39;"Now it's like we take the day off."
18:39;18:43;"I feel like people still have Columbus Day off, but it's like to really think about like"
18:43;18:47;"what we've done in history and how to change that."
18:47;18:48;"Right."
18:48;18:53;"It's a worldwide day to basically talk about how we're going to, you know, tell our children"
18:53;18:55;"about this day moving forward."
18:55;18:56;"But I think you're right."
18:56;19:01;"That's the one day a year where there really feels like this giant conversation about it."
19:01;19:02;"Wasn't it just Columbus Day?"
19:02;19:03;"Yeah."
19:03;19:04;"When was it?"
19:04;19:05;"Like last Monday?"
19:05;19:06;"Yeah, it was last Monday."
19:06;19:07;"The 10th or something?"
19:07;19:10;"I might have been down Mexico way."
19:10;19:11;"It was the 14th."
19:11;19:13;"Great radio."
19:13;19:15;"Wait, I'm looking at my..."
19:15;19:17;"People are looking at their iPhone counters."
19:17;19:18;"It was two weeks ago."
19:18;19:19;"When was Columbus Day?"
19:19;19:20;"I have to know."
19:20;19:22;"This is classic time crisis."
19:22;19:24;"A couple of weeks later."
19:24;19:28;"All right, guys, on this week's episode, we're getting to the bottom of a major debate about"
19:28;19:30;"Columbus Day."
19:30;19:31;"When was it this year?"
19:31;19:33;"Not whether or not it should be celebrated."
19:33;19:34;"When was it?"
01:58:36;01:58:37;"One."
01:58:37;01:58:39;"(explosion)"
