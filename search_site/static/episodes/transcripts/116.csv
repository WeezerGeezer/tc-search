00:00;00:03;"Time crisis in a continuing time of crisis"
00:03;00:11;"We get back together via FaceTime to talk about the news of the day the news that matters"
00:11;00:18;"We're joined by a new friend of the show Jerry salts to talk coffee art and so much more"
00:18;00:24;"We also get into a little bit of steakums and a lot of life"
00:24;00:27;"this"
00:28;00:30;"Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
00:30;00:32;"I"
00:40;00:42;"Oh"
00:50;00:54;"But picture clear everything seems so easy"
01:19;01:26;"All right time crisis back once again, this is the fourth or the fifth quarantine edition fifth"
01:26;01:32;"Five weeks of FaceTime crisis feel you know, I'm pretty used to the new reality. How you feeling Jake?"
01:32;01:36;"I'm feeling okay. I wore a mask today in public for the first time"
01:36;01:41;"Have you not been out of the house in a while? I haven't been out of the house hardly at all"
01:41;01:45;"Mm-hmm. And so I was taking the dog to the vet. Oh god"
01:45;01:49;"There's a whole I just take the dog to the vet. Well, not a big deal"
01:49;01:52;"Just she had to get some booster shots for rabies and stuff"
01:52;01:56;"Hmm, but the whole there's a whole protocol with you park in the parking lot of the vet office"
01:56;02:03;"You call them on your cell they come out. They're wearing masks. They take your dog in they do the stuff"
02:03;02:08;"They need to do you pay for it over the phone with your credit card. You never go in"
02:08;02:11;"You're sitting in your truck the whole time. Mm-hmm. I"
02:11;02:14;"Like that you refer to my van as a truck"
02:15;02:20;"I'm always into that when guys refer to their vans as trucks"
02:20;02:27;"There's something cool about just referring to all vehicles as trucks. Yeah, some are bigger than others, but it's all truck man"
02:27;02:31;"But yes, and Jake you're sitting to pick up you rolled up to the vet"
02:31;02:37;"They pick them up and then how long are we talking very quick turnaround 10 minutes tops"
02:37;02:42;"Did you think for a second at all about like I guess it is pretty important to get rabies shots"
02:42;02:47;"It did it cross your mind at all to be like, you know, maybe we'll take the dog a few months later"
02:47;02:51;"It crossed the mind but it was sort of like this is not gonna be a big deal"
02:51;02:56;"And I knew the protocol going in it seemed like a relatively low stress errand to run"
02:56;03:02;"Mm-hmm. Have you gone out in public wearing a mask yet? Well, I have long before"
03:02;03:08;"Kovid I've worn masks on planes before if like I felt a little sick and I eat or something like that"
03:08;03:12;"There's a while where I posted some pictures of me wearing a mask"
03:12;03:16;"Actually, I was helped out by some vampire fans because maybe two or three years ago"
03:16;03:21;"We were like working on the album and I was like starting to feel a little sick and are ill"
03:21;03:23;"He was really nervous about getting sick"
03:23;03:27;"He had just been sick and but we saw it kind of work and he was a little bit like"
03:27;03:32;"Stressed about you know, I was feeling pretty good, but he was stressing. I was like, you know, man"
03:32;03:34;"Let's like not take any chances"
03:34;03:38;"I'll wear a mask and we had some at the house and I threw on like a surgical mask and rolled over there"
03:38;03:44;"I didn't know exactly how to wear it correctly. And then the next day I actually figured out you got to like bend the nose part"
03:44;03:48;"Yeah to like really get it fitted. But so I wore that now and as I was doing that and I was like, you know"
03:48;03:54;"What this feels good. I feel like I'm not getting anybody sick. Nobody's getting into my zone either"
03:54;04:01;"So I was kind of into it then the next time was probably on my final trip before the"
04:02;04:05;"Pandemic really shut everything down. We were rolling out to Florida"
04:05;04:10;"We've talked about this a little bit but the weekend that we flew to Florida to play the Okachobe Festival"
04:10;04:15;"That was like this the kind of the last week before everything got canceled"
04:15;04:19;"So that week, you know, you still have people being like, oh, this is totally overblown"
04:19;04:23;"It's not gonna be a big deal and you had other people being like, I don't know it's gonna get wild"
04:23;04:27;"so I kind of wondered what the vibe would be at the airport and on the plane and"
04:27;04:31;"I wore a mask on the plane. I don't know where it came from"
04:31;04:36;"It was like this kind of like chic Korean one. It was like black and like foam"
04:36;04:37;"I don't know how effective it was"
04:37;04:44;"But I was wearing it and I saw maybe two or three other people five tops on the whole plane wearing masks"
04:44;04:48;"I did feel like a little bit funny and I was like am I overthinking this?"
04:48;04:54;"Although there were some people just open mouth coughing no hands whatsoever"
04:54;04:58;"Which I don't know if I would have noticed it in the past, but you know, like some dude just like, huh?"
04:58;05:03;"Huh, like very close to me. I was like look at this guy like what the fuck is wrong with you, dude"
05:03;05:08;"Cover your mouth. Yeah. So anyway on the one hand I felt self-conscious about wearing a mask"
05:08;05:12;"but on the other hand, I was like looking at how other people were acting and I was like"
05:12;05:18;"Who knows anyway now that everybody's supposed to wear a mask that probably makes it a little less weird"
05:18;05:24;"And like do you think this is gonna be an ongoing thing? That's pretty typical in urban centers"
05:24;05:29;"Like do you think in like four years people will be like wearing masks at Trader Joe's?"
05:29;05:33;"I think you absolutely see it stick to some extent"
05:33;05:39;"Yeah, like when you go to another country like often in East Asian people wearing masks all the time you"
05:39;05:42;"Realize that it's like it just makes sense"
05:42;05:48;"It's a way of people not transmitting disease and those countries obviously have had a little more experience"
05:48;05:50;"with the"
05:50;05:52;"Viral disease outbreak, but yeah"
05:52;05:57;"I have to imagine the average American after this even if like in some sort of miracle"
05:57;06:02;"Like a year later people like COVID-19's vanished from the face of the earth. Even if that happens"
06:02;06:09;"I think people will still continue to wear masks. I don't know if I like it, but you don't like mass culture"
06:09;06:15;"I'm not into people wearing the masks after this unless you have obviously if you have a particular sort of like"
06:16;06:19;"Immobility because of your immune systems, you know"
06:19;06:26;"Compromised for some reason but just in general like well, how did you feel in the early 2000s when when everybody started wearing skinny jeans?"
06:26;06:29;"I refuse to adopt dad jeans all the way"
06:29;06:34;"So, you know at least you have some experience with a new style"
06:34;06:41;"Taking over and you know, you do what you do and life goes on. I'm gonna be out there in 2023"
06:41;06:44;"Rocking the minivan with dad jeans and no mask"
06:45;06:49;"No mask, you're gonna see me and just be like look at that ass"
06:49;06:53;"There's a variety of masks you can wear though. You can like customize a bandana"
06:53;06:59;"You can really you know use an old t-shirt. You can like customize the mask to whatever style works for you"
06:59;07:05;"It doesn't have to be a medical mask is all I'm saying you have as an artist"
07:05;07:09;"You have a lot of creative freedom there with the mask. Could I wear one of those?"
07:09;07:12;"Zodiac killer masks like a despot was wearing"
07:14;07:18;"Balaclava yeah, just wear that into the Trader Joe's in 2023"
07:18;07:20;"Yeah, I don't know about that"
07:20;07:23;"Maybe did the despot mask of a mouthful?"
07:23;07:29;"It did yeah, so, you know, it's not super effective then"
07:29;07:36;"Molly percocets"
07:36;07:43;"Gotta represent chase a chick never chase a mask"
07:43;07:48;"Get mask on mask on get mask on"
07:48;07:51;"Percocets Molly percocets"
07:51;07:55;"Chase a chick never chase a chick"
07:55;08:01;"Two cups toast up with the game from food stamps to a whole nother domain"
08:01;08:07;"Out the bottom. I'm a living proof and compromising half a million on the coup"
08:07;08:10;"Drug houses looking like Peru"
08:11;08:17;"Graduated I was over pink money. I can barely move"
08:17;08:20;"Ask about I'm gonna bust a move"
08:20;08:22;"read James"
08:22;08:24;"33 chains"
08:24;08:26;"Oh Chanel cruising bitch game"
08:26;08:28;"type up"
08:28;08:30;"That's a liability"
08:30;08:31;"Hit yeah"
08:31;08:35;"Boosting my adrenaline. Well in terms of brand news"
08:35;08:40;"Actually, we've had a lot of people hitting this up about various things even with the weekly schedule"
08:40;08:43;"It can be hard to stay on top of all the news. I mean, especially now"
08:43;08:46;"Because we've got obviously"
08:46;08:51;"COVID-19 wreaking havoc on the world by the way, Jake maybe is very obvious to everybody"
08:51;08:54;"I had a feeling that I understood what COVID-19"
08:54;08:56;"meant"
08:56;09:03;"But I've seen like goofballs like get into like fights about it. So like the 19 in"
09:03;09:05;"COVID-19 is"
09:05;09:10;"2019 okay. I just saw like some goofy exchange where like people are like listen, man"
09:10;09:16;"We've been dealing with corona viruses for a long time. In fact, we've had 18 of them before this"
09:16;09:18;"Oh, so let's just like put things in perspective"
09:18;09:24;"We've been here before and I was like, so then I was like, I don't think this is number 19"
09:24;09:27;"I think they're like four or five six Corona"
09:27;09:34;"Viri, there's a bunch but like just in case this is I'm sure a lot of people are like, yeah, I know but just in case"
09:35;09:36;"sometimes"
09:36;09:39;"Something staring at you in plain sight. You don't really think about it"
09:39;09:42;"COVID-19 is"
09:42;09:48;"Basically a portmanteau which TC heads will appreciate and it's Corona virus disease"
09:48;09:56;"2019 Wow, so they're taking that so why isn't it just CVD? They're taking the first two letters. It really should be"
09:56;10:02;"Covity it's weird that it's yeah, Rona virus and then they just take the D from disease, right?"
10:03;10:07;"It's either like do two letters per word or one or like Co V's"
10:07;10:10;"I don't know. It's unclear to me if there's like a"
10:10;10:15;"Very specific convention like it's not like with like hurricanes or something where it's like"
10:15;10:20;"All right, then that this agency decides that it's called Hurricane Irene with"
10:20;10:26;"Diseases, even though I looked up like, okay, what's the name? They're like a corona virus disease 19"
10:26;10:30;"It's caused by the novel coronavirus, which is called like SARS something"
10:30;10:36;"It's like how come SARS was was just called SARS and this seems to be another SARS"
10:36;10:40;"Or did SARS cause a disease that was called like kovat?"
10:40;10:45;"When was the initial SARS outbreak like go three was it like kovat of the three?"
10:45;10:48;"Seinfeld I get number country. There are various other kovats"
10:48;10:54;"Let's get a number crunch brought to you by"
10:54;10:59;"2000 so SARS was actually SARS"
11:00;11:04;"Cov - - is the scientific name for SARS"
11:04;11:08;"So you get a little bit of the Co in there you get a touch of Co and"
11:08;11:13;"Then the V and then it drops off and it goes to a - what does the - stand for Oh -"
11:13;11:17;"SARS was severe acute respiratory syndrome"
11:17;11:20;"Coronavirus - oh, it's a strain"
11:20;11:26;"So it's a strain of just SARS are Co V. This is so deep"
11:26;11:31;"Okay, all I know for sure is that go 19. It's coronavirus disease"
11:31;11:32;"2019"
11:32;11:34;"That's news to me. I had no idea"
11:34;11:40;"I actually was wondering that because I feel like at some point all of the news sources started using the term kovat 19"
11:40;11:46;"Earlier in the story. It was corona virus corona virus. I'm still saying corona virus. I haven't made the switch"
11:46;11:52;"Well, I did 19 when you're comparing corona virus and kovat 19. It's also like HIV versus AIDS"
11:52;11:56;"You're talking about the name of the virus versus the disease it causes"
11:56;12:03;"Okay, I guess also for a lot of people outside of China and even in China it really kicked off in their life"
12:03;12:10;"Worrying about it dealing with it in 2020. So I guess people aren't thinking that much about 2019 anymore"
12:10;12:18;"But that's when it got started. So anyway as we live through kovat 19, we've seen some brand responses"
12:18;12:23;"It's been a strange time. I don't think we've still kind of found our equilibrium"
12:23;12:26;"There haven't been when things first started getting weird"
12:26;12:33;"There weren't too many like brutal brand Twitter fails that I'm aware of there's like some"
12:33;12:39;"Eye roll stuff like there was something it's somewhere in the world that McDonald's made announcement"
12:39;12:44;"They were gonna move the Golden Arches apart to represent social distancing or something like that"
12:44;12:51;"Yeah, I think they did that at one location in Brazil, right? And then it gets like global news coverage"
12:51;12:57;"Otherwise, obviously they did that online which is you know, obviously easy to do. I do love to think about"
12:57;13:04;"like thousands of like cherry-picker trucks going around to Golden Arches all across America and they're like"
13:04;13:07;"Separating the M and pulling them apart"
13:07;13:14;"You know the problem with that though is that the the M is a single letter that it's been divided in half"
13:14;13:18;"It's not like the the equivalent would be like if I just cut my body in half"
13:19;13:23;"To set do you know what I'm saying? It's not like it was M and then C. Donald's is over here"
13:23;13:30;"It's just a bit of a weird way to represent social distancing because it was originally one unit. That's a great point"
13:30;13:34;"Yeah, the only thing that I'll say is that you're talking about splitting one thing apart"
13:34;13:40;"Versus asking two different things to move apart. They could have said like, you know, what the densest"
13:40;13:46;"Concentration of McDonald's in the world is in you know, like Manhattan or something"
13:46;13:53;"We're gonna close every other McDonald's and show you a map that would represent social distancing"
13:53;13:57;"We're not gonna have any to McDonald's too close to each other or Starbucks could have done that"
13:57;14:01;"That's right, but it is weird though that McDonald's became the Golden Arches"
14:01;14:08;"Do you ever like think about that that they're basically just it's the letter M the Golden Arches"
14:08;14:13;"It's not like a regular M is like the Black Arches. That's right. I guess it's also the power of"
14:14;14:19;"Recognization that it's like you have this like giant and I'm just looming over"
14:19;14:23;"Highways and cities all around the world and at a certain point"
14:23;14:29;"It's no longer that the M represents McDonald's the M is McDonald's and it's not a letter anymore"
14:29;14:33;"It's a symbol and so I guess you look at the symbol and you're like it's two arches"
14:33;14:35;"And I guess they called them golden rather than yellow"
14:35;14:38;"because yellow"
14:38;14:42;"I don't know yellow. Oh my goodness, you know, it's got like a bad connotation"
14:42;14:48;"Because if you look at the McDonald's logo the M see in my mind the M was part of the word"
14:48;14:54;"But it's actually it is a giant yellow M and then it says McDonald's with an M inside"
14:54;15:02;"Underneath it right underneath it, which means that that is not an M. Those are just straight-up arches. Otherwise, it would be"
15:02;15:06;"double M McDonald's I feel like maybe I I"
15:06;15:10;"Overuse this on this show, but I think that's poor hazy"
15:11;15:15;"You know what? I'm saying? Like yeah at the very least it sounds like some French"
15:15;15:17;"philosophical shit that the M"
15:17;15:25;"Came from McDonald's, but then suddenly the signifier and the signified there's a disconnect almost like the arches being ripped apart"
15:25;15:31;"It becomes a disconnect and you're like man, isn't that just an M and it's like no, it's the golden arches. You're like well, doesn't it?"
15:31;15:39;"Represent the M and McDonald's and you're like it was inspired by the M and McDonald's but no the golden arches has its own identity"
15:39;15:43;"It's like a fully different thing. It's a very strange concept and I so I guess somewhere"
15:43;15:51;"You said this is one location in Brazil. It actually was there was no location. It was truly done just in Photoshop"
15:51;15:55;"Okay, that makes more sense because it's kind of like I got that"
15:55;15:58;"No, I I do I do the article that you read"
15:58;16:06;"Said that Brazil got heat for it because while it was promoting social distancing they were still making their employees go to work"
16:07;16:13;"Okay, and so we're getting heat for right working well within six feet of each other. Absolutely"
16:13;16:15;"I"
16:43;16:46;"Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
16:46;16:52;"You know, we've talked about variations of this before that the a"
16:52;16:55;"lot of these brand maneuvers now"
16:55;17:02;"Actually require no cherry pickers. No chainsaws. It's basically just a concept that you put out there"
17:02;17:05;"I remember on International Women's Day"
17:05;17:10;"There's a bunch of goofy brand where somewhere it was like McDonald's is turning their arch"
17:10;17:16;"Upside down to become a W for women and I had the same thought I was like did they do this somewhere?"
17:16;17:22;"Or this is just like a tweet or just like a press release and people just talk about it like it happened"
17:22;17:28;"There's also a pretty they did they actually did that some W McDonald's was in Linwood, California"
17:28;17:32;"There's also um on International Women's Day people were"
17:32;17:38;"Going insane because shell shell oil which you know doesn't have the best reputation"
17:39;17:42;"Being an oil company. They announced that"
17:42;17:50;"To honor women they were gonna insert a small apostrophe into their logo. So that shell would become"
17:50;17:52;"Chill it's funny that way"
17:52;18:00;"It's funny that the contraction of she will in like a typical American accent is chill. Yeah, chill that is so like condescending"
18:00;18:04;"It's just like fully meaningless. Yeah, I wouldn't truly sounds like a joke"
18:04;18:09;"That sounds like a joke that we would like makeup on this show. Just like what's a cool way?"
18:09;18:14;"Like here's a great idea, but like how does the CEO of shell does not I roll that like sir"
18:14;18:19;"We have an idea. I mean, come on. Maybe there's something about like a certain form of like"
18:19;18:26;"Empty signifying that's made it far enough up the corporate ladder that the guys like listen ten years ago"
18:26;18:32;"I would roll my eyes, but you know what we need to honor women in today's world. Nobody respects women"
18:33;18:36;"More than shell is a Trump. Yeah, sorry"
18:36;18:42;"I'm doing a bad Trump, but I loved it when Trump was like nobody respects women more than me. That's really like wow"
18:42;18:49;"Okay, what do you anybody can say it and there's something especially funny about shell oil where it's like, you know"
18:49;18:53;"For all I know shell has like more female executives than other oil companies"
18:53;18:58;"But that's the kind of thing where some people are like and so what you know"
18:58;19:02;"It's like Sarah Palin could have been the first female vice president. Not a lot of people were"
19:03;19:09;"Convinced that that was like historically important that she needed to be in office because obviously she didn't share a lot of people's values"
19:09;19:15;"But also like shell becoming chill. It's not even witty. I will actually give it up a little bit that McDonald's"
19:15;19:17;"painfully"
19:17;19:20;"Sending some like construction workers down to Linwood, California"
19:20;19:25;"So yeah, turn this big ass thing. You can make the case that that's like performance art"
19:25;19:28;"You're just like it's like this right?"
19:28;19:31;"corporate performance"
19:31;19:38;"They were all in it. Yeah, so if Marina Abramovich did that she rolled down to Linwood, California and"
19:38;19:40;"like painfully"
19:40;19:48;"over the course of like a day turned this like giant heavy M into a W and she was like"
19:48;19:52;"what this represents is like the brutality of"
19:52;19:58;"Changing notions of gender roles in this society and like, you know people would like come out and watch"
19:58;20:04;"You know, you could make a case for that. But yeah turning shell into shield. It's like chill what?"
20:04;20:06;"like"
20:06;20:13;"She'll buy gas. Very cool. She'll destroy the earth. Hell, you destroy the earth even better than the boys can"
20:13;20:20;"Thank you totally picture that like a commercial where there's like a little girl and"
20:20;20:23;"Like her brothers are playing with like some like, you know"
20:23;20:26;"toy cars and trucks and she's like I want to play and they're just like"
20:26;20:34;"Girls can't play with heavy-duty vehicles and she's pissed off and then like shows her growing up and like she never lets those like boys"
20:34;20:38;"Keep her down and then like she goes to engineering school"
20:38;20:42;"And she like she's driving like a Jeep or like and then she starts making money"
20:42;20:46;"She's driving a Hummer and then she like finally gets this job where she's like working on like an oil rig"
20:46;20:49;"Pristine"
20:50;20:56;"Untouched jungle somewhere and she like discovers like a huge amount of oil and then she you know"
20:56;21:01;"Like you see like the CEO being like damn you really did us a solid or you know, something like that"
21:01;21:04;"I guess that's kind of what shill is all about"
21:04;21:08;"Way back in the year of 2017"
21:08;21:12;"The sun was growing hotter and the oil was way beyond its peak"
21:12;21:16;"Crazy Hector Johnson broke into the refinery"
21:16;21:21;"And the black gold started flowing just like Boston tea"
21:21;21:25;"It was the summer of the riots and London suffered sweltering heat"
21:25;21:29;"And the gangs of mini-coopers took the battle to the streets"
21:29;21:33;"But when the creed was handed down for no more trucks and no more cars"
21:33;21:37;"They threw cans of petrol through the windows of Scotland Yard"
21:37;21:39;"And they yelled"
21:39;21:47;"Gasoline! We'll be free! We'll be free! Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
21:47;21:56;"Gasoline! We'll be free! We'll be free! Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
21:56;22:01;"It's unfortunate. I like shill's name. I think shill, I'm sure not as a company"
22:01;22:05;"Yeah, I think I looked it up once and it's like a very old Dutch company"
22:05;22:08;"That was like before they were in the oil business"
22:08;22:11;"They're like an import-export company that was like taking stuff"
22:11;22:14;"Probably like on some like Dutch East India Company s***"
22:14;22:19;"Like just transporting like goods from the rest of the world to Europe"
22:19;22:24;"And I think literally including stuff like shells, like exotic shells"
22:24;22:28;"So I think they were called shill because they were in the shill business"
22:28;22:34;"And they do have like a simple shill logo for a relatively dark company"
22:34;22:36;"But anyway, those are a couple things that have been going on"
22:36;22:40;"I think things kind of quieted down because truthfully at a lot of these companies"
22:40;22:46;"They're probably way more concerned with how they can keep selling their products"
22:46;22:48;"Rather than marketing their products"
22:48;22:52;"It's like such a crazy time for everybody"
22:52;22:57;"But into the mix we find who else? Stake 'Em"
22:57;22:58;"Old friend"
22:58;23:00;"Old friend of the show, Stake 'Em"
23:00;23:05;"And Stake 'Em, I guess Stake 'Em, they came into the brand Schrader game pretty late"
23:05;23:09;"So for them to make a splash, they've always gone for like this"
23:09;23:12;"Kind of like we know everything's bulls***"
23:12;23:15;"Like they came in so long after the kind of like"
23:15;23:18;"Haha, we're funny and mean kind of Wendy's thing"
23:18;23:23;"That the only angle left was to be kind of like nihilistic"
23:23;23:26;"And I feel like Stake 'Em kind of came onto the"
23:26;23:28;"We talked about it on the show, Stake 'Em came on the scene"
23:28;23:32;"With a long tweet thread that was about basically like"
23:32;23:35;"Modern life is f***ing meaningless"
23:35;23:36;"We work jobs we don't like"
23:36;23:38;"We're crushed by student debt"
23:38;23:41;"Yeah, we're crushed by student debt"
23:41;23:42;"We don't have health insurance"
23:42;23:47;"It was like Bernie Sanders campaign messaging through the Stake 'Em account"
23:47;23:48;"Right"
23:48;23:51;"But somehow it read as nihilistic and not like"
23:51;23:54;"It had like no political valence actually"
23:54;23:56;"I think they ended it by being like"
23:56;23:57;"And who are we?"
23:57;23:59;"We're just a f***ing brand"
23:59;24:00;"Stake 'Em"
24:00;24:02;"Yeah, we just sell frozen chipped beef"
24:02;24:06;"But anyway, they recently made some noise again because"
24:06;24:10;"What thetakeout.com is calling a postmodernist soliloquy"
24:10;24:11;"They posted"
24:11;24:13;"Takeout.com?"
24:13;24:14;"They posted a lot of s***"
24:14;24:16;"They wrote the time of corporate Twitter accounts is over"
24:16;24:18;"The time of government Twitter accounts is beginning"
24:18;24:19;"Which is fair"
24:19;24:21;"We've been monitoring that with the rise of like"
24:21;24:23;"New NJ Govs of the world"
24:23;24:25;"At least they're keeping it real"
24:25;24:28;"That's the brand Twitter version of Rock's played out dog"
24:28;24:29;"It's like"
24:29;24:32;"Listen man, brand Twitter's played out"
24:32;24:34;"We had our moment in the sun"
24:34;24:36;"Hey listen, it had a good run"
24:36;24:37;"Yeah, I know I'm implicated"
24:37;24:39;"But uh, it's over"
24:39;24:41;"And then they wrote this whole tweet thread about like"
24:41;24:44;"How you have to be smart about how you trust the data"
24:44;24:48;"When everybody's throwing out stats and numbers at you"
24:48;24:50;"During a pandemic"
24:50;24:52;"Blah blah blah, it's hard to know who to trust"
24:52;24:53;"Nah nah nah"
24:53;24:55;"And then they ended it by saying"
24:55;24:56;"We're frozen meat"
24:56;24:58;"So they have a real style"
24:58;25:00;"They basically post a lot of just kind of like"
25:00;25:03;"Deep s*** fully unrelated to their product"
25:03;25:05;"Trying to like wake people up a little bit"
25:05;25:08;"And then they always close by bringing back the steakums"
25:08;25:09;"We're a frozen meat brand"
25:09;25:14;"Posting ads inevitably made to misdirect people and generate sales"
25:14;25:15;"So this is peak irony"
25:15;25:17;"But hey, we live in a society"
25:17;25:20;"They know they're being funny when they say we live in a society"
25:20;25:23;"So please make informed decisions to the best of your ability"
25:23;25:26;"And don't let anecdotes dictate your worldview, okay?"
25:26;25:28;"Steakum bless"
25:28;25:29;"Oh yeah"
25:29;25:32;"It's a little bit unclear to me what they're really going for"
25:32;25:34;"If they're saying like don't trust the right"
25:34;25:38;"Or maybe even a little bit don't trust the media period"
25:38;25:40;"Wait, so what did they say again?"
25:40;25:42;"It was like don't trust anecdotes?"
25:42;25:45;"That don't let anecdotes like throw you off"
25:45;25:47;"When you're trying to understand the numbers"
25:47;25:51;"Which to me, that doesn't make me think about Trump"
25:51;25:53;"That actually makes me think about like the New York Times or something"
25:53;25:56;"Where they'll write, you know, a whole profile"
25:56;26:00;"About like, you know, a really heartbreaking case of somebody dying"
26:00;26:03;"Like a surprisingly young person dying"
26:03;26:06;"Which I don't think is wrong if you want to read about that"
26:06;26:09;"But when you hear about a shocking case of somebody"
26:09;26:12;"In their 30s or 40s dying from COVID"
26:12;26:16;"You might want to know that just to know what people are going through in your community"
26:16;26:19;"It doesn't necessarily give you an understanding of like"
26:19;26:22;"The points on the spreadsheet"
26:22;26:24;"Because as we've known for a long time"
26:24;26:28;"It still seems to predominantly kill people much older"
26:28;26:31;"So I don't know exactly what they're going for here"
26:31;26:35;"But of course, these kind of threads make a little bit of noise"
26:35;26:37;"And Steakum can kind of come back and be like"
26:37;26:39;"Steakum bless"
26:39;26:41;"Then I guess people like to share this and be like"
26:41;26:44;"I'm sorry but Steakums is making a lot more sense"
26:44;26:47;"Than a lot of members of the media right now"
26:47;26:51;"And then it kind of, you know, it gets a little bit of buzz"
26:51;26:54;"But they're not really"
26:54;26:57;"I mean, what they're saying is pretty oblique"
26:57;27:00;"You know what, and look, I do have sympathy for the people working on Steakums' account"
27:00;27:03;"Because they're probably some pretty chill people"
27:03;27:05;"They're doing their best, but there is"
27:05;27:08;"As they point out, there's a ceiling"
27:08;27:10;"To how real Bran Twitter can get"
27:10;27:12;"Because if you always got to turn it back and be like"
27:12;27:15;"And hey, by the way, we're part of the problem too bro"
27:15;27:18;"We're just trying to sell you bullsh*t"
27:18;27:20;"We're just trying to generate sales"
27:20;27:23;"It kind of is a reminder why a brand can't be Bernie"
27:23;27:26;"By the way, RIP to the Bernie campaign"
27:26;27:29;"But a brand can't be Bernie because at a certain point"
27:29;27:33;"The only thing that a brand can do to really make life better"
27:33;27:37;"And you know, change things for people suffering from student debt"
27:37;27:40;"Lack of healthcare, all those things, doesn't involve social media"
27:40;27:43;"The only thing that a brand can do to be Bernie-esque"
27:43;27:48;"Would be to be like, and that's why we are giving our workers"
27:48;27:50;"The seat on the board of this company"
27:50;27:52;"So that they can have a voice in decision making"
27:52;27:54;"And not just let it be the executives"
27:54;27:57;"And that's why we're raising the minimum wage"
27:57;27:59;"You know, it's like, that's the thing about Bran Twitter"
27:59;28:02;"Is that there's this hard ceiling where the most self-aware"
28:02;28:04;"Funny Bran Twitter"
28:04;28:09;"You can only get so far with memes and tweet threads"
28:09;28:12;"Because they never actually take it to that place of being like"
28:12;28:15;"We're donating SACIMs to local hospitals"
28:15;28:16;"And even that"
28:16;28:19;"Actually, weirdly, the hospitals turned us down"
28:19;28:23;"Hey, I'll keep it real with you"
28:23;28:24;"We tried"
28:24;28:25;"We tried?"
28:25;28:27;"It was a Craven publicity ploy"
28:27;28:29;"And they didn't even want our sh*t"
28:29;28:32;"So yeah, maybe some of you can relate to that"
28:32;28:34;"You know what though?"
28:34;28:37;"It's like, because they hire Bran Twitter"
28:37;28:39;"Just to kind of generate hype"
28:39;28:41;"And not to actually help direct the company"
28:41;28:43;"I'm telling you, if I owned SACIMs"
28:43;28:45;"I would be like, you know what?"
28:45;28:46;"Cool fantasy"
28:46;28:49;"It's my dream"
28:49;28:51;"I'd be like, you know what?"
28:51;28:52;"The world's falling apart"
28:52;28:56;"And I've unleashed full nihilism on the timeline"
28:56;28:58;"With my social media department"
28:58;29:00;"Why not just take that extra step and say"
29:00;29:03;"Maybe the only way to generate attention"
29:03;29:04;"In this brutal time"
29:04;29:07;"Is to actually do something deeply good"
29:07;29:09;"Like to really set yourself apart from the pack"
29:09;29:11;"Just be like, you know what?"
29:11;29:12;"From now on"
29:12;29:16;"SACIMs is like becoming a non-profit"
29:16;29:17;"And look, we're gonna be honest"
29:17;29:20;"Our CEO is still gonna take down a hefty salary"
29:20;29:23;"But hey, so does the chairman of the Metropolitan Opera"
29:23;29:25;"Dude, I love this"
29:25;29:27;"This is basically a Punisher Burgers kind of fantasy"
29:27;29:30;"Where you're actually like, cut the sh*t"
29:30;29:32;"And you're just like, every day I see f*cking brands"
29:32;29:36;"Talk about how they can relate to the alienated millennials"
29:36;29:37;"Blah blah blah"
29:37;29:39;"I'm actually gonna f*cking do something about it"
29:39;29:40;"Because they don't need ironic tweets"
29:40;29:42;"What they need is food"
29:42;29:44;"What they need is board seats"
29:44;29:46;"What they need is essentially like socialism"
29:46;29:48;"Like, SACIMs"
29:48;29:51;"And you know, apparently Marx was interested"
29:51;29:53;"In the structure of corporations"
29:53;29:56;"Because he saw the way that it could be a vehicle for socialism"
29:56;29:58;"So just like, full on"
29:58;30:01;"From now on, SACIMs goals as a business"
30:01;30:03;"Are fundamentally different"
30:03;30:04;"Than just about anybody else's"
30:04;30:06;"In the frozen beef sector"
30:06;30:09;"Well dude, I think you take it even farther"
30:09;30:11;"And you go full on Shell Corporation"
30:11;30:14;"Which started off as shipping shells and other things"
30:14;30:15;"Before they got into oil"
30:15;30:18;"I think you get out of the chipped beef industry"
30:18;30:20;"Because it's not good for the planet"
30:20;30:22;"But you do maintain the SACIMs name"
30:22;30:24;"Just making an environmental non-profit?"
30:24;30:27;"Yeah, you just get into environmental advocacy"
30:27;30:30;"You're, you know, saving rain forests or whatever"
30:30;30:31;"But you're still called SACIMs"
30:31;30:33;"That would be the ultimate social media move"
30:33;30:35;"Is you go viral"
30:35;30:38;"But there's absolutely no financial upside"
30:38;30:42;"Rather than using viral tweets to generate sales"
30:42;30:45;"You sacrifice sales to go viral"
30:45;30:48;"And you say SACIMs will no longer manufacture"
30:48;30:51;"Our frozen chipped beef product"
30:51;30:54;"From now on, SACIMs is a non-profit"
30:54;30:57;"That's committed to reducing global warming"
30:57;30:59;"By two degrees"
30:59;31:02;"In the next five years"
31:02;31:04;"To do this, we're gonna"
31:04;31:06;"And like, you bring people in and you're like"
31:06;31:09;"Hey, we've got a lot of factory equipment to sell"
31:09;31:11;"We've got some rotators"
31:11;31:13;"That we're looking to sell"
31:13;31:14;"And you're basically like"
31:14;31:16;"Alright Jimmy Dean Sausage, your move"
31:16;31:18;"We have fully divested"
31:18;31:20;"I would love to see like, just one brand"
31:20;31:22;"I would even respect it"
31:22;31:25;"Even if it's some like, scumbag giant corporation"
31:25;31:27;"That owns like, two thousand brands"
31:27;31:28;"I would even respect that"
31:28;31:30;"If like, wait, who's our favorite brand"
31:30;31:33;"That owns Fiddle Faddle and all that sh*t"
31:33;31:35;"Isn't it ConAgra?"
31:35;31:36;"Oh, ConAgra, right"
31:36;31:38;"It would be cool if ConAgra was like"
31:38;31:42;"Listen, we know that we make a lot of sh*t products"
31:42;31:44;"Not everything we do is good for the planet"
31:44;31:47;"But we're gonna put our money where our mouth is"
31:47;31:51;"From now on, we are converting Fiddle Faddle"
31:51;31:53;"Into an environmental non-profit"
31:53;31:55;"Fiddle Faddle will no longer exist"
31:55;31:58;"As a caramel corn product"
31:58;32:01;"But all of the resources we put into Fiddle Faddle"
32:01;32:03;"Will now go towards, you know, whatever"
32:03;32:07;"Fiddle Faddle will become a labor organization"
32:07;32:11;"That will actually help organize unions"
32:11;32:13;"Across the rest of our brands"
32:13;32:15;"Including all our factories"
32:15;32:18;"And look out for workers' rights"
32:18;32:20;"All that money we made from Fiddle Faddle"
32:20;32:23;"We will commit to this kind of kind vibes sh*t"
32:23;32:29;"Watching while some old friends do a line"
32:29;32:37;"Holding back the want to in my own addicted mind"
32:37;32:48;"And it was still the thing even I could do"
32:48;32:53;"Wishing all these old things were new"
32:53;32:59;"Watching while some young men go to jail"
32:59;33:07;"And to show it all on TV just to see somebody fail"
33:07;33:18;"And I guess there's not a single thing a man like me can do"
33:18;33:23;"Wishing all these old things were new"
33:23;33:25;"I don't know if this is the energy we need right now"
33:25;33:27;"You know, it's like, you're getting caught in the middle"
33:27;33:30;"I know Stakem is pushing the Overton window of brand Twitter"
33:30;33:32;"About as far as it'll go"
33:32;33:35;"But at a certain point, this always happens"
33:35;33:37;"You kind of innovate, a form gets innovated"
33:37;33:40;"And at a certain point, what seemed innovative"
33:40;33:42;"Kind of seems stuck in the middle"
33:42;33:43;"And you're kind of like, you know what?"
33:43;33:45;"Either just sell us the f*cking beef"
33:45;33:49;"Or end the company and go full fight the power, man"
33:49;33:52;"But like, you're trying to do too much at once"
33:52;33:54;"It's kind of like the Democrats"
33:54;33:55;"It's kind of like, come on guys"
33:55;33:57;"Either be the opposition party"
33:57;34:00;"Or just f*ck, be the Republicans and let somebody else do it"
34:00;34:02;"But you know, enough of this"
34:02;34:05;"Keep some healthcare stuff, like, come on"
34:05;34:08;"Anyway, we're about to get on the phone with Jerry Saltz"
34:08;34:10;"Now Jake, as an American painter"
34:10;34:13;"You might be the best at explaining who Jerry Saltz is"
34:13;34:17;"Sure, yeah, he's the chief art critic at New York Magazine"
34:17;34:19;"And is a pretty prolific writer"
34:19;34:21;"I've read his stuff for years"
34:21;34:25;"He's also very active on Twitter and Instagram"
34:25;34:27;"Which is unusual for art critics"
34:27;34:31;"Usually the art critic is a little more of a staid, quieter person"
34:31;34:34;"Sort of like, kind of waiting in the wings, you know"
34:34;34:37;"But Jerry's very public and has fun with it"
34:37;34:39;"And that's kind of why he went viral recently"
34:39;34:42;"Because he posted a picture of 18 large coffee cups"
34:42;34:44;"That he got from a gas station"
34:44;34:47;"And he said, I buy these and I take them home"
34:47;34:48;"And put them in the fridge"
34:48;34:50;"And that's my coffee for the week"
34:50;34:54;"So you can imagine, it received a range of responses"
34:54;34:57;"Some people being like, that's weird as hell"
34:57;34:58;"Other people were just angry"
34:58;35:00;"They were just like, dude, just make coffee at home"
35:00;35:04;"Why would you buy 18 large gas station coffees and bring them home?"
35:04;35:06;"And we had a lot of people tweeting at us"
35:06;35:09;"And of course the first thing that went through any TC head's mind"
35:09;35:10;"Sure"
35:10;35:13;"Was that he's the Lonnie's dad of gas station coffee"
35:13;35:17;"Just as Lonnie's dad had a chest freezer in Jake's hometown"
35:17;35:20;"Full of frozen McRibs"
35:20;35:23;"Jerry's Salt's is kind of hoarding gas station coffee"
35:23;35:26;"The only difference is that the McRib is a seasonal thing"
35:26;35:29;"So Lonnie's dad, it makes actually a lot of sense"
35:29;35:31;"Why he would want to freeze a bunch"
35:31;35:33;"So he could eat them in the off season"
35:33;35:36;"Whereas coffee is something that's very easy to make at home"
35:36;35:39;"So we had to get on the phone with him"
35:39;35:41;"And learn a little more about what's going on with him"
35:41;35:43;"And he's also got a book out right now"
35:43;35:44;"It's called How to Be an Artist"
35:44;35:45;"I actually started reading it"
35:45;35:49;"It's a cool book but it doesn't talk a lot about coffee so far"
35:49;35:51;"But maybe this all kind of ties in"
35:51;35:52;"So we need to talk to him"
35:52;35:53;"He's got a lot going on"
35:53;35:57;"To kind of understand what's happening over in his world"
35:57;36:01;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
36:01;36:05;"Hello Jerry"
36:05;36:07;"Hello, who am I speaking to?"
36:07;36:09;"This is Ezra and Jake on Time Crisis"
36:09;36:11;"Thank you very much for joining us on the podcast"
36:11;36:12;"Hey Jerry"
36:12;36:14;"Hey Ezra, hey Jake"
36:14;36:16;"I love being here"
36:16;36:20;"You guys are calling me pretty late at night on the East Coast"
36:20;36:22;"But I love hearing from you"
36:22;36:24;"Well we appreciate you slotting us in"
36:24;36:27;"I understand the end of the day"
36:27;36:29;"Is not always the best time for an interview"
36:29;36:31;"But we appreciate you making the time"
36:31;36:32;"Well Jerry, to start"
36:32;36:35;"You went a little bit viral recently"
36:35;36:39;"With your tweet about your current mode"
36:39;36:42;"Of purchasing and storing coffee"
36:42;36:46;"Yes it did"
36:46;36:48;"You really made some waves"
36:48;36:50;"And I think you ruffled a few feathers"
36:50;36:51;"Yeah"
36:51;36:52;"Now on this program"
36:52;36:55;"We've always been interested in people who"
36:55;36:57;"Even long before COVID"
36:57;37:00;"People who are very dedicated to something specific"
37:00;37:01;"And buy it in bulk"
37:01;37:02;"Yeah"
37:02;37:03;"So in this instance"
37:03;37:04;"You're out in Connecticut"
37:04;37:07;"Obviously you don't have to give your specific location"
37:07;37:08;"But are you in a rural area?"
37:08;37:13;"I'm about two hours north of New York City"
37:13;37:16;"It is very rural around here"
37:16;37:18;"Listen, for the listeners that don't know"
37:18;37:20;"What I do is"
37:20;37:22;"I'm an art critic"
37:22;37:24;"And you're listening to an art critic"
37:24;37:26;"So get ready"
37:26;37:28;"And I was a truck driver"
37:28;37:29;"Until I was 40"
37:29;37:31;"And this is a long story"
37:31;37:34;"And they may or may not ask me about it"
37:34;37:38;"I did not start doing what I'm doing"
37:38;37:41;"Until very, very, very late in life"
37:41;37:43;"And I have no degrees"
37:43;37:45;"Didn't go to school"
37:45;37:49;"And was desperate somehow to be in the art world"
37:49;37:50;"Right?"
37:50;37:52;"I also was raised by animals"
37:52;37:54;"Basically"
37:54;37:58;"And I, among the many things I never learned to do"
37:58;38:00;"Was to cook"
38:00;38:02;"Or even to make coffee"
38:02;38:04;"And I know making coffee is easy"
38:04;38:06;"And I've done it"
38:06;38:09;"I've operated coffee machines and whatnot"
38:09;38:11;"But right now"
38:11;38:14;"As a guy that started so late in life"
38:14;38:19;"Every single minute for me counts of working"
38:19;38:22;"So now I'll tell you what I posted"
38:22;38:25;"Once every few days when I'm in the city"
38:25;38:30;"I buy about 10 cups of deli coffee"
38:30;38:32;"Large, black"
38:32;38:34;"And I put them in the fridge"
38:34;38:36;"And about 5 years ago"
38:36;38:41;"My wife and I bought a handful of 7 and 11 double-golts"
38:41;38:44;"With metal, reusable straws"
38:44;38:48;"We reuse these same 5 cups"
38:48;38:50;"And every morning I fill them with ice"
38:50;38:53;"And I suck 2 of them back"
38:53;38:55;"And so does my wife"
38:55;38:57;"Now that we're sheltering in place"
38:57;39:00;"And I'm very careful about going into town"
39:00;39:03;"I bought 18 coffees"
39:03;39:05;"Put them in my car"
39:05;39:07;"Decided to have a little fun"
39:07;39:10;"Posted the picture of the damn coffees"
39:10;39:13;"And the internet lost its sh*t"
39:13;39:15;"It turns out"
39:15;39:17;"That even though"
39:17;39:19;"Tens of millions of Americans"
39:19;39:21;"The people like me"
39:21;39:23;"That used to work on trucks"
39:23;39:25;"Drink deli coffee"
39:25;39:27;"And gas station coffee"
39:27;39:28;"Every day"
39:28;39:29;"And we kind of love it"
39:29;39:31;"You big babies"
39:31;39:33;"That the art world"
39:33;39:35;"And the world of the 1 million people"
39:35;39:39;"That follow me across my 3 social network platforms"
39:39;39:45;"Artisanal people that started going on and on"
39:45;39:46;"About like"
39:46;39:50;"Wow, you really must drink cold brew"
39:50;39:52;"French press"
39:52;39:53;"Trip"
39:53;39:55;"Special blend coffee beans"
39:55;39:58;"From Malaysia"
39:58;40:00;"And I was really shocked"
40:00;40:02;"And there was a lot of hate"
40:02;40:04;"Tweeting about my post"
40:04;40:06;"Saying I'm a bad man"
40:06;40:09;"I deserve to get COVID-19"
40:09;40:11;"And I found it amazing"
40:11;40:13;"But yeah, okay"
40:13;40:15;"You don't like how I drink coffee"
40:15;40:18;"I'm sure I could have better coffee"
40:18;40:23;"But I'm on a daily deadline as an art critic"
40:23;40:26;"So that's one of the ways"
40:26;40:29;"I don't do things at home"
40:29;40:32;"So do I sound defensive?"
40:32;40:33;"Yes I do"
40:33;40:37;"I was really torn about a hundred new assholes"
40:37;40:39;"When you say you"
40:39;40:41;"I imagine you're talking about the haters on the internet"
40:41;40:44;"On this show, you have two supporters"
40:44;40:45;"Jake and I"
40:45;40:47;"We didn't have you on"
40:47;40:50;"To have a kind of Jerry Springer moment"
40:50;40:52;"We were fascinated by it"
40:52;40:53;"I will be"
40:53;40:56;"And I can understand getting called late at night"
40:56;40:58;"By a bunch of west coast knuckleheads"
40:58;41:00;"After the hell you've been through online"
41:00;41:03;"I can understand being a little bit"
41:03;41:05;"You know, what am I getting myself into here?"
41:05;41:07;"First of all, we support it"
41:07;41:08;"We're not coffee snobs"
41:08;41:10;"What do you drink?"
41:10;41:12;"Don't lie, don't lie"
41:12;41:13;"Okay, well first of all"
41:13;41:15;"We have something in common"
41:15;41:18;"Is that most of my life I've been a musician"
41:18;41:20;"My only honest job was as a teacher"
41:20;41:22;"I taught eighth grade in Brooklyn"
41:22;41:24;"I've also been somebody between"
41:24;41:27;"Teaching when I was 22, 23"
41:27;41:29;"And then being a musician"
41:29;41:32;"I've never been good at cooking or making coffee"
41:32;41:34;"And I love deli coffee"
41:34;41:35;"I love street cart coffee"
41:35;41:37;"And I really like Dunkin Donuts coffee"
41:37;41:40;"But you know, I'll go to a hipster coffee place too"
41:40;41:41;"I guess one difference"
41:41;41:42;"I don't mind sitting around"
41:42;41:44;"I like sitting around at a coffee shop"
41:44;41:46;"I've never been a coffee snob"
41:46;41:47;"Jake, what about you?"
41:47;41:48;"Yeah, I mean, historically"
41:48;41:49;"I'm right there with you"
41:49;41:51;"I was never a coffee snob"
41:51;41:52;"I'm down for whatever"
41:52;41:54;"As long as it's hot and fresh"
41:54;41:56;"Now recently, you know"
41:56;41:58;"I'll buy nice beans from the artisanal place"
41:58;42:00;"Down the street and I'll make it at home"
42:00;42:02;"But again, I have a long history with gas station coffee"
42:02;42:04;"I think the thing that really kind of"
42:04;42:05;"Piqued our interest"
42:05;42:09;"Was drinking like four day old gas station coffee"
42:09;42:11;"Because I don't care if you have the nicest coffee"
42:11;42:12;"On planet earth"
42:12;42:14;"When it's four days old"
42:14;42:16;"I've never noticed it going"
42:16;42:18;"Changing in taste"
42:18;42:19;"Honestly"
42:19;42:21;"I guess I have bad taste"
42:21;42:22;"Okay?"
42:22;42:23;"Well, it sounds like you're icing it"
42:23;42:25;"I'm doing it for the drug"
42:25;42:27;"I am not drinking it so much for the taste"
42:27;42:30;"The way most people are"
42:30;42:32;"I'm on the drug, man"
42:32;42:33;"From morning to night"
42:33;42:35;"I don't have a life"
42:35;42:36;"I'm with you"
42:36;42:38;"To me, coffee is about the high"
42:38;42:40;"Yeah, because I don't use anything else"
42:40;42:42;"I got no other drugs"
42:42;42:44;"I'm 69 years old"
42:44;42:46;"I can't do drugs really anymore"
42:46;42:48;"I barely drink"
42:48;42:50;"You know, five beers a year"
42:50;42:52;"And so, you know, I'm a huge loser"
42:52;42:55;"That needs to be awake"
42:55;42:58;"You know, 16, 20 hours a day"
42:58;42:59;"Well, 16"
42:59;43:00;"Writing"
43:00;43:01;"It's all I do"
43:01;43:03;"I don't do any other thing"
43:03;43:05;"You're writing all day, every day"
43:05;43:06;"Oh, yeah"
43:06;43:07;"Because"
43:07;43:08;"Listen"
43:08;43:11;"For most of my writing life"
43:11;43:13;"Post 40 years old"
43:13;43:16;"I've been on a weekly deadline"
43:16;43:19;"And, you know, the last, say, 10 years"
43:19;43:21;"Of social media"
43:21;43:24;"I've been on a daily and more"
43:24;43:27;"And I can't write if writing is without you"
43:27;43:29;"That means the reader"
43:29;43:33;"I'm not interested in writing for the future"
43:33;43:36;"That, you know, in 50 years"
43:36;43:39;"Some great textbook will have one of my essays"
43:39;43:42;"I'm interested right now"
43:42;43:45;"In speaking to as many people as possible"
43:45;43:47;"May I add one more thing, you guys?"
43:47;43:49;"Or am I going now?"
43:49;43:50;"No, please"
43:50;43:51;"Go for it"
43:51;43:53;"Most art criticism"
43:53;43:55;"Is annoying or boring"
43:55;43:58;"Probably because it's written from"
43:58;44:01;"The one at the top of a pyramid"
44:01;44:03;"Down to the many"
44:03;44:06;"And what I was interested in from the start"
44:06;44:10;"And you can hear from how I even talk and think"
44:10;44:13;"I was not fit to write with that kind of authoritative"
44:13;44:16;"One down to the many"
44:16;44:19;"I wanted to have it be where"
44:19;44:22;"The many could speak to one another"
44:22;44:25;"And that's what I've tried to do with my work"
44:25;44:27;"Social media"
44:27;44:28;"Even now"
44:28;44:31;"I don't pretend to have the authority"
44:31;44:33;"Nobody's got the authority"
44:33;44:35;"If people don't realize that now"
44:35;44:37;"With the crisis we're living in"
44:37;44:39;"You're just never going to realize it"
44:39;44:40;"Oh yeah"
44:40;44:42;"And the coffee thing"
44:42;44:44;"You know, it's a minor tick"
44:44;44:47;"That drives people majorly crazy"
44:47;44:49;"And it's rather beautiful"
44:49;44:50;"That we can be friends"
44:50;44:51;"Well, hold on a second"
44:51;44:53;"I mean, well Jerry, I gotta say"
44:53;44:54;"When I found out you were going to come on the show"
44:54;44:56;"I just started reading your book"
44:56;44:57;"How to be an artist"
44:57;44:58;"Hey, thanks"
44:58;45:00;"No, I've been really enjoying it"
45:00;45:01;"You briefly mentioned at the beginning of the book"
45:01;45:03;"How you were a truck driver"
45:03;45:05;"Didn't have a formal education as an art critic"
45:05;45:07;"And you talk a lot about"
45:07;45:09;"Every chapter is basically advice for people"
45:09;45:11;"Who are interested in becoming artists"
45:11;45:12;"And from what I've seen so far"
45:12;45:13;"I really like the vibe"
45:13;45:15;"Encouraging, reminding people"
45:15;45:17;"That a lot of it is just getting down to work"
45:17;45:19;"Which clearly is important to you"
45:19;45:20;"As you're telling us"
45:20;45:22;"But based on what you're saying"
45:22;45:25;"This coffee incident"
45:25;45:27;"It doesn't sound like a minor thing"
45:27;45:28;"I mean"
45:28;45:29;"Okay, I'm defensive"
45:29;45:30;"No, no, I know you're defensive"
45:30;45:32;"But again, you're in a safe space here"
45:32;45:34;"I guess what I'm saying is"
45:34;45:36;"That obviously"
45:36;45:38;"I'm sure our listeners don't need to be told"
45:38;45:40;"But of all the art forms"
45:40;45:42;"Visual art is one that is often"
45:42;45:44;"The most controlled, as you said"
45:44;45:46;"By kind of"
45:46;45:48;"Gobbledygook criticism"
45:48;45:50;"By rich people"
45:50;45:51;"By privileged people"
45:51;45:53;"Gatekeepers"
45:53;45:54;"Gatekeepers, right"
45:54;45:56;"Everything you're doing"
45:56;45:58;"Being somebody who didn't have that background"
45:58;45:59;"Didn't have that privilege"
45:59;46:01;"And worked in a totally different field"
46:01;46:02;"As a truck driver"
46:02;46:04;"The way you come to writing about art"
46:04;46:06;"You're on a mission to kind of"
46:06;46:08;"Upend some of that stuff"
46:08;46:10;"At least in the way that you write about your work"
46:10;46:12;"So this coffee thing"
46:12;46:14;"The fact that a lot of your followers"
46:14;46:16;"Might have an expectation"
46:16;46:18;"That a well-known New York Magazine art critic"
46:18;46:21;"Is going to share their values about coffee"
46:21;46:23;"I feel like this incident kind of gets at"
46:23;46:26;"At some of these larger issues"
46:26;46:28;"Within the art world"
46:28;46:30;"And I guess the coffee world"
46:30;46:32;"You're saying something kind of big"
46:32;46:34;"And very beautiful and very right"
46:34;46:36;"Viruses come"
46:36;46:38;"And viruses go"
46:38;46:40;"But art is long"
46:40;46:42;"Art is going to be here"
46:42;46:45;"Long after all of this"
46:45;46:48;"Has faded even into memory"
46:48;46:51;"Creativity was with us in the caves"
46:51;46:54;"It's in every bone"
46:54;46:56;"In every person's body"
46:56;46:58;"It's a survival strategy"
46:58;47:01;"I've never met a person"
47:01;47:03;"That's not creative"
47:03;47:07;"Darwin, in fact, did not say"
47:07;47:10;"It's survival of the strongest and the fittest"
47:10;47:12;"What he was trying to say"
47:12;47:14;"And he spent the whole last years of his life"
47:14;47:16;"Trying to clarify"
47:16;47:20;"It's survival of those able most to adapt"
47:20;47:23;"Right now"
47:23;47:25;"Art finds itself"
47:25;47:27;"And creativity"
47:27;47:29;"Anybody listening to this"
47:29;47:33;"Finds itself in its almost ideal state"
47:33;47:37;"That is, creativity thrives"
47:37;47:39;"Under pressure"
47:39;47:42;"And now we are in smaller spaces"
47:42;47:44;"In more intimate settings"
47:44;47:46;"With like the kids at the table"
47:46;47:49;"And Nana in the background"
47:49;47:51;"Like washing somebody's clothes"
47:51;47:53;"And cooking going on"
47:53;47:59;"But 99.999% of all the things we've ever made"
47:59;48:02;"In the last 50,000 years"
48:02;48:05;"Were created in exactly these conditions"
48:05;48:07;"The art world"
48:07;48:09;"Had grown"
48:09;48:11;"Big, bloated"
48:11;48:13;"Obscene with money"
48:13;48:16;"Efficient, safe"
48:16;48:19;"A place to, you know, park money"
48:19;48:22;"And what I'm interested in"
48:22;48:27;"And this goes all the way back to that idiot question about the coffee"
48:27;48:31;"Is that I'm not that efficient"
48:31;48:36;"I believe in an art world that's not efficient, safe, hyperactive"
48:36;48:39;"I believe in one that's eccentric"
48:39;48:41;"That's based in risk"
48:41;48:46;"That is composed, frankly, of losers like me"
48:46;48:51;"Ne'er-do-wells, outlaws, visionaries, geniuses"
48:51;48:54;"People like you"
48:54;48:55;"And me"
48:55;48:59;"That really have no other chance"
48:59;49:01;"I mean, out in the world"
49:01;49:04;"I lived there, man, as a truck driver"
49:04;49:06;"That was really hard"
49:06;49:08;"I'm an excellent driver"
49:08;49:10;"And after this is all over"
49:10;49:13;"Maybe I can go back if I lose my job"
49:13;49:16;"Because, after all, when I started writing Criticism"
49:16;49:18;"There were thousands of critics"
49:18;49:24;"And there's now probably all of 50 weekly critics in America"
49:24;49:27;"I'm the last of my kind"
49:27;49:29;"I'm writing as hard as I can"
49:29;49:32;"And, yeah, I'm eccentric"
49:32;49:34;"I barely can do anything"
49:34;49:37;"Except the one lousy thing I do"
49:37;49:39;"And so"
49:39;49:44;"It's a tick that's probably a disease or a neurosis"
49:44;49:46;"And I'm actually writing about it"
49:46;49:52;"So you've actually asked about something that I've just written about 8,000 words on"
49:52;49:53;"Oh, wow"
49:53;49:57;"Give me your body"
49:57;50:01;"Give me your mind"
50:01;50:05;"Open your heart"
50:05;50:08;"Hold down your blind"
50:08;50:10;"Give me your love"
50:10;50:12;"Give me it all"
50:12;50:14;"Get me in the kitchen"
50:14;50:16;"Get me in the hall"
50:16;50:20;"All for God's sake"
50:20;50:24;"Money for God's sake"
50:24;50:28;"All for God's sake"
50:28;50:31;"Money for God's sake"
50:31;50:34;"With this response that you were getting from people"
50:34;50:35;"I guess on the one hand"
50:35;50:38;"You just had old-fashioned classism and snobbery"
50:38;50:41;"You had people basically going, ""Ew, gas station coffee"""
50:41;50:43;"That was one part of the attack"
50:43;50:44;"Yeah"
50:44;50:49;"And then you had other people who just didn't understand why you were getting so much"
50:49;50:52;"Which were the comments that really got under your skin?"
50:52;50:57;"That drinking coffee this way proved that I am a bad person"
50:57;51:00;"And while that could be true"
51:00;51:04;"You just never know where the litmus test is"
51:04;51:06;"And I'm sure I'm a bad person"
51:06;51:09;"But I don't sound that bad, do I?"
51:09;51:10;"I'm a little weird"
51:10;51:13;"Not much weirder than anyone listening"
51:13;51:17;"I know how to do a lot of things other people can't do"
51:17;51:20;"And I don't think you're bad for not being able to"
51:20;51:26;"You know, piece together the entire Sistine Chapel ceiling on your own"
51:26;51:30;"So they said you're a bad person because you don't make coffee at home?"
51:30;51:31;"Was that the thrust of it?"
51:31;51:32;"Yes"
51:32;51:37;"Yeah, because it's so simple that an idiot could do it"
51:37;51:39;"And you know what my answer to them is?"
51:39;51:41;"I'm an idiot"
51:41;51:44;"You know, it's a wonder I can even feed myself, right?"
51:44;51:46;"Like Dylan said"
51:46;51:47;"Idiot Wendt"
51:47;51:48;"Hey"
51:48;51:50;"I think, first of all, I think you're totally"
51:50;51:52;"You're interested in this for some reason"
51:52;51:53;"I think you're totally"
51:53;51:55;"Well, first of all, I think you're totally in the right here"
51:55;51:58;"Because I would challenge all the haters"
51:58;52:01;"Because look, yes, one could make coffee at home"
52:01;52:03;"Is it a useful skill? Often?"
52:03;52:05;"Is it for everybody? Not necessarily"
52:05;52:08;"But I would challenge all these haters who are giving you sh*t about this"
52:08;52:10;"Throw open your pantry"
52:10;52:11;"Let's see what's going on inside"
52:11;52:13;"Is there anything in your fridge?"
52:13;52:16;"Any product that you could have made yourself?"
52:16;52:18;"Is there Campbell's soup in your pantry?"
52:18;52:20;"You don't know how to make chicken soup from scratch?"
52:20;52:22;"Is there dried pasta?"
52:22;52:23;"You don't know how to make your own pasta?"
52:23;52:26;"Like at a certain point, it's like, chill out"
52:26;52:28;"None of us are frontiersmen"
52:28;52:29;"Like"
52:30;52:31;"Here's the thing"
52:31;52:33;"I think I understand"
52:33;52:35;"And why I kind of don't mind at all"
52:35;52:38;"A couple of things you have to understand about me"
52:38;52:40;"Is I have elephant skin"
52:40;52:43;"I am pretty out there in my work"
52:43;52:46;"I write about what I do like"
52:46;52:48;"But I also write about what I don't like"
52:48;52:52;"And that can really stir up a lot of, you know, bad feelings"
52:52;52:55;"And I don't want people to feel bad"
52:55;52:57;"And if you ever go on my"
52:57;53:00;"Just follow me, say, on Instagram"
53:00;53:02;"@jerrysalz"
53:02;53:03;"Okay?"
53:03;53:05;"You will see 50 people"
53:05;53:08;"Tear me a new one every day"
53:08;53:10;"On Twitter"
53:10;53:11;"On Facebook"
53:11;53:13;"And I guess I have a couple things"
53:13;53:15;"I wrote about this in the book"
53:15;53:16;"But I think"
53:16;53:17;"One"
53:17;53:19;"You could be right"
53:19;53:21;"I think there's a grain of truth"
53:21;53:24;"In every single criticism that people get"
53:24;53:27;"I don't feel so bad from it"
53:27;53:29;"And the other thing is"
53:29;53:30;"Frankly"
53:30;53:33;"There's nothing anybody could say to me"
53:33;53:34;"Bad about me"
53:34;53:36;"That I have not said"
53:36;53:39;"A hundred times worse to myself"
53:39;53:42;"And that I will every day"
53:42;53:44;"All day while I'm trying to work"
53:44;53:47;"I too hear the same demons"
53:47;53:49;"That all of you hear"
53:49;53:50;"I'm no good"
53:50;53:52;"I don't know what I'm doing"
53:52;53:53;"I have a bad neck"
53:53;53:55;"I don't have enough money"
53:55;53:57;"Men don't like me"
53:57;53:58;"Women don't like me"
53:58;53:59;"Whoever"
53:59;54:00;"So"
54:00;54:01;"Criticism"
54:01;54:03;"Is the price of admission"
54:03;54:05;"And there's nothing wrong with that"
54:05;54:06;"Oh yeah"
54:06;54:07;"What I wanted to say is"
54:07;54:10;"The one thing I really did love"
54:10;54:11;"About the criticism is"
54:11;54:13;"I think it's fun listening to"
54:13;54:16;"Like a call-in sex show"
54:16;54:17;"For example"
54:17;54:18;"Because"
54:18;54:22;"No matter what the person is saying"
54:22;54:23;"You think"
54:23;54:26;"Well at least I'm better at sex than that person"
54:26;54:31;"And I think that I became the idiot caller"
54:31;54:34;"Where everyone else could go"
54:34;54:37;"Well as weird as my refrigerator"
54:37;54:38;"Or my sex life"
54:38;54:40;"Or my work life"
54:40;54:42;"Or my home life is"
54:42;54:45;"This guy is weirder"
54:45;54:46;"And you know what?"
54:46;54:47;"I'll own it"
54:47;54:49;"It's pretty weird"
54:49;54:51;"But wait till you read about the story"
54:51;54:53;"Of how this came to pass"
54:53;54:55;"It'll only get weirder"
54:55;54:56;"Looking forward to that"
54:56;54:57;"You know like I said"
54:57;54:59;"I just started the book"
54:59;55:01;"I'll probably finish it by tomorrow"
55:01;55:02;"But in the meantime"
55:02;55:04;"What I've noticed so far is that"
55:04;55:05;"You talk in the book"
55:05;55:07;"That not only were you a truck driver"
55:07;55:09;"You also were an aspiring artist"
55:09;55:11;"Before you became an art critic"
55:11;55:12;"That's right"
55:12;55:13;"But there's times in the book"
55:13;55:14;"That you"
55:14;55:16;"Even though you're primarily giving"
55:16;55:19;"Advice to like visual artists"
55:19;55:20;"Or however you describe that world"
55:20;55:22;"You say that this could be useful to anybody"
55:22;55:24;"And there's even times when you refer to"
55:24;55:26;"Your work as an art critic"
55:26;55:27;"And you see the ways in which"
55:27;55:30;"Things that apply to an artistic practice"
55:30;55:32;"Advice or ideas"
55:32;55:34;"Also apply to the practice of art criticism"
55:34;55:36;"Which also opens up this question"
55:36;55:39;"Is art criticism a form of art?"
55:39;55:40;"So I guess one question I have is"
55:40;55:41;"When you"
55:41;55:43;"I don't know if we're talking about social media"
55:43;55:45;"Or the image itself"
55:45;55:47;"Obviously this is how you drink coffee"
55:47;55:49;"That's just a fact of your life"
55:49;55:51;"When you post the picture"
55:51;55:53;"And you let people know about it"
55:53;55:54;"Is that art?"
55:54;55:56;"Ah, good question"
55:56;55:58;"I think it's this"
55:58;56:02;"I believe that all of us in our work"
56:02;56:05;"There's a few things incumbent on us"
56:05;56:07;"One is that we make our work"
56:07;56:11;"As much as possible in our own voice"
56:11;56:14;"That idiot lyric that you wanted to write"
56:14;56:16;"That silly poem"
56:16;56:18;"That funny dance"
56:18;56:20;"That new recipe"
56:20;56:22;"Whatever it is you're trying to make"
56:22;56:25;"I don't want you to draw a picture"
56:25;56:28;"Exactly like Leonardo da Vinci"
56:28;56:31;"I have really no interest in you doing that"
56:31;56:33;"And if you want to, good for you"
56:33;56:35;"Good on you"
56:35;56:37;"I'm interested in you drawing a picture"
56:37;56:39;"Of your Nana"
56:39;56:42;"With as much skill as you could learn"
56:42;56:44;"But then taking that skill"
56:44;56:46;"And doing it in your own voice"
56:46;56:48;"The next thing I'm interested in"
56:48;56:53;"Is what I call radical vulnerability"
56:53;56:55;"What I want you to do in your work"
56:55;56:58;"Is to make yourself"
56:58;57:00;"Your inner self"
57:00;57:03;"The self that sometimes you're ashamed of"
57:03;57:06;"Sometimes it's kind of weird or eccentric"
57:06;57:08;"You don't have to tell your secrets"
57:08;57:12;"But I want you to be as radical in your work"
57:12;57:15;"As you would want to gain access to"
57:15;57:17;"In anyone else's"
57:17;57:21;"And so that idiot picture of the coffee"
57:21;57:23;"Is simply that"
57:23;57:25;"Of just trying to live out loud"
57:25;57:27;"A little bit"
57:27;57:29;"Dance naked in public"
57:29;57:32;"That's what all people who make things"
57:32;57:34;"Every musician"
57:34;57:37;"If you make food just at home for yourself"
57:37;57:39;"That's fine with me"
57:39;57:41;"It's a beautiful thing"
57:41;57:43;"But some people really like it"
57:43;57:46;"When other people eat the food"
57:46;57:48;"And yeah, I bought the coffee"
57:48;57:51;"And yeah, I shared it"
57:51;57:54;"And yes, I knew there was something weird about it"
57:54;57:56;"But I also knew"
57:56;57:59;"There's something very me about it"
57:59;58:02;"And so I shared it"
58:02;58:05;"Is this a podcast about food and coffee?"
58:05;58:07;"It's an internet radio show"
58:07;58:11;"About music and corporate food history"
58:11;58:13;"It's a free-for-all"
58:13;58:16;"Okay, so here's what's going to happen to your subject"
58:16;58:20;"The whole thing is being absolutely changed"
58:20;58:21;"As we speak"
58:21;58:23;"100%"
58:23;58:26;"When the few restaurants reopen again"
58:26;58:28;"That finally reopen"
58:28;58:30;"And there are not going to be many"
58:30;58:32;"The chefs in them"
58:32;58:33;"The cooks"
58:33;58:35;"You're going to be eating basically"
58:35;58:37;"Airline type food"
58:37;58:39;"Those will survive"
58:39;58:41;"And people that like good food"
58:41;58:44;"Chefs have to work without gloves"
58:44;58:47;"Because when they're putting in pinches of spices"
58:47;58:50;"They're tasting from everything at all times"
58:50;58:52;"That's completely out"
58:52;58:54;"Restaurants will never be allowed"
58:54;58:56;"To have more than 50% capacity"
58:56;58:59;"For a year or two in this country"
58:59;59:02;"What do you do when the person next to you coughs?"
59:02;59:05;"When I go back to museum guys"
59:05;59:08;"What do I do if there's somebody standing right next to me"
59:08;59:10;"And their nose is running"
59:10;59:12;"Or they do cough"
59:12;59:16;"There's many aspects to what we're living through"
59:16;59:18;"And I can promise you"
59:18;59:22;"Food culture is just going to be devastated"
59:22;59:24;"As is my world"
59:24;59:29;"The art world is going to be devastated"
59:29;59:31;"And a lot of people may say"
59:31;59:33;"Well, they deserve it"
59:33;59:36;"Just don't wish ill on anybody right now"
59:36;59:38;"It might deserve it, it might not"
59:38;59:40;"What I would say is"
59:40;59:42;"These worlds are being wiped out"
59:42;59:45;"And here's what I want to say to your listeners"
59:45;59:47;"Once upon a time"
59:47;59:50;"I am from that former world"
59:50;59:52;"Of eccentrics and losers"
59:52;59:54;"Unprofessionals"
59:54;59:57;"Idiots, visionaries, whatever"
59:57;01:00:00;"Geniuses, not me, but others"
01:00:00;01:00:04;"And I was able to build a world"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"I helped build that city"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"I built that art world"
01:00:08;01:00:10;"And it was beautiful"
01:00:10;01:00:12;"And that food world was beautiful"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"And it became too big"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"And bloated"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"And f***ed up with money"
01:00:18;01:00:20;"And servicing too many rich people"
01:00:20;01:00:23;"And in my world, the prices were too high"
01:00:23;01:00:26;"I'd say nothing of restaurant prices"
01:00:26;01:00:29;"What I would say to you all is that"
01:00:29;01:00:33;"Batons are being passed as we speak"
01:00:33;01:00:36;"That when the virus goes"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"And the old worlds are gone"
01:00:38;01:00:42;"New worlds are going to have to be rebuilt"
01:00:42;01:00:46;"And you are being given the most incredible gift of all"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"The one that I had"
01:00:48;01:00:52;"You are tasked to create a new world"
01:00:52;01:00:54;"And it's going to be great"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"It's going to be hard"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"It's going to be fun"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"It's going to be insane"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"There's going to be a lot of trying of everything"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"You're going to play fast"
01:01:04;01:01:06;"You're going to play loose"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"You're going to live off the land"
01:01:08;01:01:10;"You're going to have to adapt"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"Adapt like creativity always has"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"In real time"
01:01:14;01:01:18;"And it's going to be fine"
01:01:18;01:01:21;"It's just not going to be fine for a little bit"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"So long term you're optimistic?"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"It isn't that I'm optimistic"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"It's just that I know"
01:01:27;01:01:30;"I'm beginning to glean what's going on"
01:01:30;01:01:33;"That this thing has many phases to it"
01:01:33;01:01:37;"And that the infrastructure that was too big"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"Not to fail"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"Is failing as we speak"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"But you can't see it quite yet"
01:01:43;01:01:47;"No one can afford to not make money for"
01:01:47;01:01:49;"Two months"
01:01:49;01:01:51;"Let alone three"
01:01:51;01:01:53;"Performing art spaces in America"
01:01:53;01:01:56;"Can usually go about one month"
01:01:57;01:02:01;"The same way Trump had fast food places"
01:02:01;01:02:04;"At the stimulus table"
01:02:04;01:02:06;"And Amazon"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"And Twitter"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"Facebook and all of that"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"They had places at the table"
01:02:12;01:02:15;"The restaurant world didn't have much of one"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"And the creative world"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"The art world had nothing"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"And so"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"They're not being protected"
01:02:23;01:02:26;"And being an artist is one of the most precious"
01:02:26;01:02:29;"Fragile jobs of all"
01:02:29;01:02:31;"In the very best of times"
01:02:31;01:02:33;"Again listeners will say"
01:02:33;01:02:36;"Oh those f*****s they made so much money"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"My answer is that about"
01:02:38;01:02:42;"55 mostly white male artists"
01:02:42;01:02:44;"Made a lot of money"
01:02:44;01:02:50;"That's 1% of 1% of 1% of 1%"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"Of all the artists working"
01:02:52;01:02:55;"And we became obsessed with them"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"And the big mega galleries"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"You know David Swerner"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"Hauser and Wirth"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"That's Domino's Pizza"
01:03:03;01:03:06;"That's Taco Bell you're being obsessed with"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"Those will survive"
01:03:08;01:03:10;"They're going to do just fine"
01:03:10;01:03:11;"And they have some"
01:03:11;01:03:14;"I mean Domino's Pizza is pretty damn good pizza"
01:03:14;01:03:15;"You know"
01:03:15;01:03:18;"Yeah I'm going to be attacked for that too now"
01:03:18;01:03:19;"Anyway"
01:03:19;01:03:20;"The point being"
01:03:20;01:03:24;"Let's not worry about Domino's Pizza right now"
01:03:24;01:03:25;"Get ready"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"Because in about 18 months"
01:03:27;01:03:29;"You're going to be rebuilding the world"
01:03:29;01:03:30;"And it's going to be great"
01:03:30;01:03:31;"Right well I hope so"
01:03:31;01:03:32;"Because"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"I'm not optimistic and I'm not pessimistic"
01:03:34;01:03:35;"There's definitely a school of thought"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"Like you're saying in the art world"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"And in music too"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"There's a school of thought that"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"Rather than this crisis moment"
01:03:42;01:03:45;"Weakening the big institutions"
01:03:45;01:03:46;"If anything"
01:03:46;01:03:47;"They'll come out of it stronger"
01:03:47;01:03:50;"Because their smaller competitors"
01:03:50;01:03:51;"Might get wiped out"
01:03:51;01:03:52;"So"
01:03:52;01:03:53;"Oh yeah"
01:03:53;01:03:54;"You're right"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"Even more reason why people have to"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"Work harder to create alternatives"
01:03:58;01:04:01;"And other ways of being an artist"
01:04:01;01:04:02;"And creating work"
01:04:02;01:04:07;"Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor"
01:04:07;01:04:13;"Come and say something about a queen"
01:04:13;01:04:19;"There were peasants singing and drummers drumming"
01:04:19;01:04:23;"And the archers split the tree"
01:04:23;01:04:29;"There was a fanfare blowing to the sun"
01:04:29;01:04:37;"That was floating on the breeze"
01:04:37;01:04:56;"Look at mother nature on the run in the 1970s"
01:04:56;01:04:57;"Well Jerry just before you go"
01:04:57;01:04:58;"Because"
01:04:58;01:04:59;"Yeah"
01:04:59;01:05:00;"It's been great talking to you about"
01:05:00;01:05:01;"The coffee stuff and the art stuff"
01:05:01;01:05:02;"But I don't think there's a lot of people"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"Who've had the transition from Chuck Driver"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"To major art critic"
01:05:06;01:05:07;"I mean you would know if there were some others"
01:05:07;01:05:08;"But I'm not aware of any"
01:05:08;01:05:11;"But I hear that your CB handle"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"Was the Jewish Cowboy"
01:05:13;01:05:14;"Is that correct?"
01:05:14;01:05:15;"Shalom partner"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"I used to say yes"
01:05:17;01:05:18;"Really?"
01:05:18;01:05:19;"That's true"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"I'd get on the radio and go"
01:05:21;01:05:23;"This is the Jewish Cowboy"
01:05:23;01:05:25;"Shalom partner"
01:05:25;01:05:29;"Anybody like to talk about the work of Richard Serra?"
01:05:29;01:05:35;"And no one ever spoke to me"
01:05:35;01:05:37;"Those guys had me marked"
01:05:37;01:05:39;"You know on the radio"
01:05:39;01:05:41;"And in the truck stops too"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"I was never spoken to"
01:05:43;01:05:46;"You just seemed too different from the other Chuck Drivers?"
01:05:46;01:05:47;"You weren't embraced by the community?"
01:05:47;01:05:48;"Never"
01:05:48;01:05:51;"I wanted to meet prostitutes every night"
01:05:51;01:05:53;"That was my"
01:05:53;01:05:55;"You know I was a young guy"
01:05:55;01:05:56;"I was single"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"And that was my dream"
01:05:58;01:05:59;"But no one ever"
01:05:59;01:06:03;"They looked at me and they knew in five seconds"
01:06:03;01:06:06;"That I was weird"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"And I must have been"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"Speaking of weird outsiders"
01:06:10;01:06:11;"With regards to trucking"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"I don't know what type of music you listen to"
01:06:13;01:06:17;"But do you feel any type of kinship with Jerry Garcia"
01:06:17;01:06:19;"Given that you have the same first name"
01:06:19;01:06:22;"And he famously wrote a song called Truckin"
01:06:22;01:06:25;"Despite not being a classical truck driver"
01:06:25;01:06:28;"Are your listeners ready to really hate on me?"
01:06:28;01:06:29;"Yes"
01:06:29;01:06:32;"I loathe the Grateful Deck"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"I think that"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"That is such bullsh*t"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"Hippie crap"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"And people"
01:06:40;01:06:42;"I hope you enjoy it"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"I'm not against it"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"You sound a bit against it"
01:06:46;01:06:47;"Sir"
01:06:47;01:06:50;"I'm not against people who like it"
01:06:50;01:06:51;"Jerry hold on"
01:06:51;01:06:52;"Like we said this is a safe space"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"But I would like to challenge you for a second"
01:06:54;01:06:55;"Oh god"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"Don't you feel"
01:06:56;01:06:57;"You don't be a hippie"
01:06:57;01:06:58;"Turn the page"
01:06:58;01:07:00;"Forget the 60s"
01:07:00;01:07:01;"Well first of all"
01:07:01;01:07:02;"The Grateful Dead"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"They toured all the way until 1995"
01:07:04;01:07:05;"With the tragic death"
01:07:05;01:07:06;"Of your"
01:07:06;01:07:07;"What was it?"
01:07:07;01:07:09;"Of your namesake Jerry Garcia"
01:07:09;01:07:10;"And then they continued to tour"
01:07:10;01:07:11;"With John Mayer"
01:07:11;01:07:12;"With Dead & Co"
01:07:12;01:07:14;"And they're still out there"
01:07:14;01:07:15;"Yeah"
01:07:15;01:07:16;"But why"
01:07:16;01:07:17;"You know"
01:07:17;01:07:18;"Because we've talked on the show a little bit"
01:07:18;01:07:19;"That Lou Reed"
01:07:19;01:07:21;"Another kind of downtown New York"
01:07:21;01:07:22;"Art type dude"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"He was very jealous of the Grateful Dead"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"And they used to play together in the 60s"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"Velvet Underground and Grateful Dead"
01:07:28;01:07:29;"And he would always say"
01:07:29;01:07:30;"I'm better at"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"The 60s"
01:07:31;01:07:32;"He would say"
01:07:32;01:07:33;"I'm better at guitar than Jerry Garcia"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"And he had a lifelong hatred towards them"
01:07:35;01:07:37;"Do you feel like it's worth"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"You're somebody who challenges the status quo"
01:07:39;01:07:40;"The art world"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"Don't you think there is just a thing"
01:07:42;01:07:46;"That these kind of downtown New York"
01:07:46;01:07:48;"Cool artsy people"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"They just hate on the Grateful Dead"
01:07:50;01:07:51;"Willy nilly"
01:07:51;01:07:52;"Here's what I think"
01:07:52;01:07:53;"Is it possible that you're falling into"
01:07:53;01:07:54;"No"
01:07:54;01:07:55;"No?"
01:07:55;01:07:56;"Okay alright"
01:07:56;01:07:57;"I'd love to hear your defense"
01:07:57;01:07:58;"Here but let me just"
01:07:58;01:07:59;"I get to defend myself"
01:07:59;01:08:00;"All I know is"
01:08:00;01:08:01;"I did live in a time"
01:08:01;01:08:03;"When there was an underground"
01:08:03;01:08:04;"Okay"
01:08:04;01:08:06;"And I would never say"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"The Grateful Dead were bad"
01:08:08;01:08:12;"Because they were a big successful mega band"
01:08:12;01:08:15;"You know even if they were still weird"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"And acid heads and all that"
01:08:17;01:08:19;"But listen"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"This is just like art"
01:08:21;01:08:23;"You cannot prove"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"That Jerry Garcia is good"
01:08:25;01:08:26;"Or bad"
01:08:26;01:08:29;"It's all a matter of taste"
01:08:29;01:08:31;"Now I would love to tell"
01:08:31;01:08:34;"Your whole damn generation"
01:08:34;01:08:37;"Turn the page from the 60s"
01:08:37;01:08:41;"It was your parents and grandparents time"
01:08:41;01:08:43;"And you've got to turn the page"
01:08:43;01:08:45;"There's nothing there for you anymore"
01:08:45;01:08:47;"Turn the page kids"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"Jerry why do you think the 60s"
01:08:49;01:08:52;"Like still cast such a huge shadow"
01:08:52;01:08:53;"Culturally"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"Because you all"
01:08:55;01:08:57;"Are mythifying it"
01:08:57;01:08:59;"You're bestowing it with like some"
01:08:59;01:09:02;"Integrity and honesty"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"And underground"
01:09:04;01:09:06;"Or you know purity"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"And it was none of that"
01:09:08;01:09:09;"It was just"
01:09:09;01:09:11;"The beginning of something"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"That got very good"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"And then got bad"
01:09:15;01:09:18;"Don't just focus on that period"
01:09:18;01:09:19;"Okay but Jerry"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"I think the 90s were much better"
01:09:21;01:09:22;"As a decade"
01:09:22;01:09:23;"But you know what"
01:09:23;01:09:24;"Do it yourself"
01:09:24;01:09:25;"I think the Deadheads"
01:09:25;01:09:26;"They particularly like"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"The shows from spring 1990"
01:09:28;01:09:29;"Because"
01:09:29;01:09:30;"Oh good for them"
01:09:30;01:09:31;"I mean"
01:09:31;01:09:34;"The f***s are like fetishizing stuff"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"And all I can say is"
01:09:36;01:09:38;"Keep fetishizing it"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"I'll buy my coffee fetish"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"You go back to 1990"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"And share your tapes"
01:09:44;01:09:47;"And if you're making your work"
01:09:47;01:09:48;"I love you"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"I deeply deeply mean it"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"I truly do"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"I would not even care if you're listening to Jerry Garcia"
01:09:55;01:09:58;"Well are you familiar with his work as a visual artist?"
01:09:58;01:09:59;"Right"
01:09:59;01:10:01;"No I'm just f***ing with you"
01:10:01;01:10:05;"Can we stop with coffee and Jerry Garcia?"
01:10:05;01:10:07;"If you ever wear ties"
01:10:07;01:10:09;"We would love to send you a Jerry Garcia tie"
01:10:09;01:10:11;"With his original paintings"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"Maybe for a formal occasion"
01:10:13;01:10:15;"No no but you're right"
01:10:15;01:10:16;"It's a matter of taste"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"The only thing that I would say is that"
01:10:18;01:10:19;"Oh my god"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"The last thing I'll say Jerry"
01:10:21;01:10:22;"Look"
01:10:22;01:10:25;"It's not every day we have a Jerry on the program"
01:10:25;01:10:26;"You know?"
01:10:26;01:10:27;"I know it's a dead name"
01:10:27;01:10:28;"I have a dead name"
01:10:28;01:10:29;"It's a great name"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"And then you also got Jerry Seinfeld"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"He's a little more 90s"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"And Jerry Sandusky"
01:10:36;01:10:37;"So f*** me"
01:10:37;01:10:38;"Yeah"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"And also it's a name"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"I wonder if it's gonna come back"
01:10:42;01:10:43;"I feel like you don't"
01:10:43;01:10:44;"No it's Jewish"
01:10:44;01:10:45;"People hate us"
01:10:45;01:10:46;"How old are you?"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"I was born in 1984"
01:10:48;01:10:50;"I just turned 36"
01:10:50;01:10:51;"Hey happy birthday"
01:10:51;01:10:53;"And how old are you Jake?"
01:10:53;01:10:54;"I'm 43"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"Hey you're both kids to me"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"And remember"
01:10:58;01:11:02;"I had not started doing what I am now doing"
01:11:02;01:11:05;"Until after I was your age"
01:11:05;01:11:08;"I mean in this case being a weekly art critic"
01:11:08;01:11:13;"I was 47 the first time I tried that"
01:11:13;01:11:14;"Wow"
01:11:14;01:11:17;"And then I won a Pulitzer Prize last year"
01:11:17;01:11:18;"So what the hell"
01:11:18;01:11:19;"It's amazing"
01:11:19;01:11:20;"Don't"
01:11:20;01:11:21;"No it's amazing"
01:11:21;01:11:22;"I'm so lucky"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"And you give a lot of examples in the book too"
01:11:24;01:11:27;"That's one of your encouragements to people"
01:11:27;01:11:29;"Is like don't freak out about"
01:11:29;01:11:30;"Is it too late to start?"
01:11:30;01:11:31;"No"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"And you give examples of other artists"
01:11:32;01:11:33;"Who also got a late start"
01:11:33;01:11:34;"Oh yeah"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"In fact the late Bill Withers"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"Who just recently died"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"I don't know if you got a problem with him"
01:11:40;01:11:41;"A la the Grateful Dead"
01:11:41;01:11:44;"No he had sunshine even when he was gone"
01:11:44;01:11:45;"He was beautiful"
01:11:45;01:11:46;"He's a great songwriter"
01:11:46;01:11:47;"Yeah"
01:11:47;01:11:48;"It's not late 40s"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"But as far as pop music goes"
01:11:50;01:11:53;"To pick up a guitar in your 30s"
01:11:53;01:11:54;"And begin a career"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"That involves writing 5 or 6"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"Of the most iconic songs"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"American pop music has ever produced"
01:12:00;01:12:01;"Very very rare"
01:12:01;01:12:03;"And also then he just dipped too"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"He didn't want to do it his whole life either"
01:12:05;01:12:06;"Which I also think is cool"
01:12:06;01:12:07;"Amazing"
01:12:07;01:12:09;"Well a lot of your listeners"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"If they would"
01:12:11;01:12:14;"Get to work you big babies"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"You could be Bill Withers"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"You could be me"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"You could be these two guys"
01:12:20;01:12:22;"With a radio show"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"It's pretty easy"
01:12:24;01:12:27;"Good things happen to the people who work"
01:12:27;01:12:31;"Not working is the easiest thing in the world"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"And right now people"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"If you're sheltering in place"
01:12:35;01:12:40;"You have the secret weapon of time"
01:12:40;01:12:41;"Use a little of it"
01:12:41;01:12:44;"Do that idiot thing in the back of your mind"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"For me, make bad art"
01:12:46;01:12:49;"For me and I will love you"
01:12:49;01:12:51;"It's interesting that you're saying this"
01:12:51;01:12:52;"And just as a final thing Jerry"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"It's interesting that you're leaving us with this"
01:12:54;01:12:55;"Your main thing"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"Is you're encouraging other people to work"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"Because lately on social media"
01:12:59;01:13:01;"It feels like there's been this big debate"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"About how productive do you need to be"
01:13:03;01:13:04;"When you're quarantined"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"And you see a lot of people using the language"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"Of like self care"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"And you know"
01:13:10;01:13:11;"Trauma and stuff"
01:13:11;01:13:12;"It's a TED talk"
01:13:12;01:13:13;"Well basically you see a lot of people saying"
01:13:13;01:13:14;"Oh well guys"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"Shakespeare was quarantined from the plague"
01:13:16;01:13:17;"When he wrote King Lear"
01:13:17;01:13:19;"Go do that thing you've been waiting to do"
01:13:19;01:13:20;"But then you've seen a lot of people being like"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"Um hey guys"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"If you're processing the trauma"
01:13:24;01:13:25;"Even if it's not directly affecting you"
01:13:25;01:13:28;"If you're processing the trauma of this horrible time"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"And that makes you feel drained"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"And like you don't have anything to do"
01:13:32;01:13:33;"That's fine"
01:13:33;01:13:34;"You can veg out all day"
01:13:34;01:13:35;"Because do what you ever have to do"
01:13:35;01:13:36;"Sign with me"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"White people are weird that way"
01:13:38;01:13:42;"They love talking about wellness and bullsh*t"
01:13:42;01:13:43;"And I'm saying"
01:13:43;01:13:44;"Do whatever you want"
01:13:44;01:13:47;"I'm a permission machine"
01:13:47;01:13:51;"To make you enter the ecstatic wormhole"
01:13:51;01:13:55;"That is in your DNA"
01:13:55;01:13:57;"And if you don't want to do anything"
01:13:57;01:14:01;"And if you just want to watch CNN or something all day"
01:14:01;01:14:02;"Be my guest"
01:14:02;01:14:03;"I'm happy"
01:14:03;01:14:06;"But you're saying that there's an ecstatic wormhole"
01:14:06;01:14:07;"In front of all of us"
01:14:07;01:14:08;"If we get to work"
01:14:08;01:14:09;"Everywhere"
01:14:09;01:14:10;"Turn off the TV"
01:14:10;01:14:11;"Jerry I gotta say"
01:14:11;01:14:12;"It's been great talking to you"
01:14:12;01:14:13;"I think if he was here today"
01:14:13;01:14:14;"You too"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"I think you and Jerry Garcia would get along"
01:14:16;01:14:17;"Call me crazy"
01:14:17;01:14:21;"I think you and Ezra Klein and Jake Tapper would get along"
01:14:21;01:14:22;"That's totally different"
01:14:22;01:14:23;"That's unfair"
01:14:23;01:14:24;"That's very unfair"
01:14:25;01:14:26;"It's first name"
01:14:27;01:14:30;"You're still fighting the 60s"
01:14:30;01:14:31;"Jerry I just told you"
01:14:31;01:14:32;"Spring 90"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"The dead heads love spring 90"
01:14:34;01:14:35;"Oh Jesus"
01:14:35;01:14:36;"Okay Jerry"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"That's 30 years ago"
01:14:38;01:14:39;"Okay okay Jerry"
01:14:39;01:14:40;"What about fish"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"Okay you know what"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"We'll talk about it next time"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"Jerry thank you so much for taking the time"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"What about late Dylan"
01:14:48;01:14:49;"Oh Murder Most Foul"
01:14:49;01:14:50;"Murder"
01:14:50;01:14:51;"I mean amazing"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"Murder Most Foul man"
01:14:53;01:14:54;"Did you love it"
01:14:54;01:14:55;"Are you a fan"
01:14:55;01:14:56;"It's like he says"
01:14:56;01:14:57;"It's like Dylan says"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"And I quoted him in the book"
01:14:59;01:15:02;"Yeah I don't know where those songs come from"
01:15:02;01:15:05;"It's like a ghost writes them"
01:15:05;01:15:09;"That's all that Dylan is asking you all to do"
01:15:09;01:15:13;"Just get out of the way and let the ghost use you"
01:15:13;01:15:14;"It's a great song"
01:15:14;01:15:16;"It's just great"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"Give them another Nobel or whatever they gave you"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"It's one of the most affecting pieces of art"
01:15:20;01:15:21;"I'm going to sleep"
01:15:21;01:15:22;"It's 10 o'clock"
01:15:23;01:15:25;"And old people that write all day"
01:15:25;01:15:26;"We're going to sleep"
01:15:26;01:15:27;"I love you guys"
01:15:27;01:15:29;"I wish I lived on the west coast"
01:15:29;01:15:30;"We'll call you earlier"
01:15:30;01:15:31;"We'll call you"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"We'll call you earlier next time"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"And we hope you'll call in again"
01:15:35;01:15:36;"Once you're not at home"
01:15:36;01:15:37;"I didn't call you"
01:15:37;01:15:38;"You called me"
01:15:38;01:15:39;"I did not call you"
01:15:39;01:15:41;"Jerry it's a figure of speech"
01:15:41;01:15:44;"Come on man"
01:15:44;01:15:45;"It's a figure of speech"
01:15:45;01:15:46;"I'm a writer"
01:15:46;01:15:47;"Are we going to split hairs here"
01:15:47;01:15:48;"I'm limited"
01:15:48;01:15:49;"Alright fair enough Jerry"
01:15:49;01:15:52;"Hopefully you'll allow us to call you again"
01:15:52;01:15:53;"In the future"
01:15:53;01:15:54;"I love your takes"
01:15:54;01:15:57;"And obviously a lot of the time today was taken up by"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"The controversy you've been embroiled in"
01:15:59;01:16:01;"But we'd love to ask you more questions about"
01:16:01;01:16:03;"The Grateful Dead among other things"
01:16:03;01:16:05;"And buy the god damn book"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"How to be an artist"
01:16:07;01:16:10;"You'll thank me if you do people"
01:16:10;01:16:11;"Absolutely"
01:16:11;01:16:12;"Alright thanks Jerry"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"Alright thank you both a lot"
01:16:14;01:16:15;"Keep up the great work"
01:16:15;01:16:16;"Thank you"
01:16:16;01:16:17;"You too, bye"
01:16:17;01:16:23;"Ain't no sunshine when she's gone"
01:16:23;01:16:29;"It's not warm when she's away"
01:16:29;01:16:33;"Ain't no sunshine when she's gone"
01:16:33;01:16:36;"And she's always gone too long"
01:16:36;01:16:42;"Anytime she goes away"
01:16:42;01:16:48;"Wonder this time where she's gone"
01:16:48;01:16:55;"Wonder if she's gonna stay"
01:16:55;01:16:58;"Ain't no sunshine when she's gone"
01:16:58;01:17:01;"And this house just ain't no home"
01:17:01;01:17:07;"Anytime she goes away"
01:17:07;01:17:22;"And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know"
01:17:22;01:17:25;"I leave the young thing alone"
01:17:25;01:17:30;"But ain't no sunshine when she's gone"
01:17:30;01:17:34;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"Well Jake that was a hell of a call"
01:17:36;01:17:37;"What a legend"
01:17:37;01:17:40;"Senior art critic at New York Magazine"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"Pulitzer Prize winner"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"Very influential guy"
01:17:44;01:17:49;"But obviously also getting into scraps about coffee on Twitter"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"Interesting guy with a lot to say"
01:17:51;01:17:56;"I meant to ask him whether he was doctoring the four day old coffee with like cream and sugar"
01:17:56;01:18:00;"Well you know I'll tell you one thing actually which I didn't get a chance to say either"
01:18:00;01:18:06;"The day of the Grammys everybody came to our house to kind of get together"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"Do a little hair and makeup whatever so you know"
01:18:08;01:18:12;"C.T. and Bao, Ariel and Danielle, everybody came to the crib"
01:18:12;01:18:16;"And so you know when you're hosting everybody in the morning"
01:18:16;01:18:19;"You gotta make sure you get some breakfast and coffee"
01:18:19;01:18:27;"So I got those big cardboard jug cartons, a box"
01:18:27;01:18:31;"I got two big boxes of coffee from Coffee Bean"
01:18:31;01:18:34;"Every big coffee chain does them, Starbucks does it too"
01:18:34;01:18:39;"So we got two big ones of those you know and then also came with all the fixins"
01:18:39;01:18:44;"And you know we probably got through, you know classic, you get a little too much"
01:18:44;01:18:48;"And so we probably got through about two thirds of one"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"And then we got this whole other one and so you know"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"We're not gonna just waste all that coffee"
01:18:52;01:18:55;"There's probably like 30 cups in there or something like that"
01:18:55;01:18:58;"So we put the whole other one in the fridge"
01:18:58;01:19:02;"And then I was kind of like well this seems weird like that this is just sitting there"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"There's something about it struck me as a little gross"
01:19:04;01:19:07;"You're not supposed to have this cold but do I reheat it?"
01:19:07;01:19:10;"And then you know what I said f*** it and I started just pouring myself an iced coffee"
01:19:10;01:19:14;"From the formerly hot Coffee Bean coffee box"
01:19:14;01:19:17;"Just about every day for the next week or so"
01:19:17;01:19:20;"And other people were like are you sure that's good?"
01:19:20;01:19:22;"Like there's something seemed weird about it"
01:19:22;01:19:25;"But the more I drank it I was like this tastes fine"
01:19:25;01:19:29;"I was a week out, it had been in the fridge for a week and I was still enjoying it"
01:19:29;01:19:33;"So I gotta say that I can see where Jerry's coming from"
01:19:33;01:19:36;"I don't think it would taste terrible especially when it's cold"
01:19:36;01:19:37;"He's throwing it on ice"
01:19:37;01:19:41;"I think ice is crucial, I think if you were microwaving that week old coffee"
01:19:41;01:19:43;"It would taste terrible"
01:19:43;01:19:46;"Hot coffee's gotta be fresh but yeah"
01:19:46;01:19:47;"I agree with that"
01:19:47;01:19:49;"That's the difference"
01:19:49;01:19:52;"I bet at some hipster coffee shops which according to Jerry"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"Probably aren't very long for this world"
01:19:54;01:19:57;"But in the old world when there'd be a hipster coffee shop"
01:19:57;01:20:01;"And you'd sometimes get a cold brew or whatever his haters were going on about"
01:20:01;01:20:06;"I bet a lot of times they're probably pulling some jug out of the fridge"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"That might be a few days old"
01:20:08;01:20:11;"And I bet many people have drank that and said mmm"
01:20:11;01:20:12;"Mmm mmm mmm"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"You know like they don't know"
01:20:14;01:20:16;"Well especially cold brew"
01:20:16;01:20:21;"Which is a different process than the coffee you were drinking out of the coffee bean carton"
01:20:21;01:20:25;"And we've talked about on this show that to me cold brew is often very sour and weird"
01:20:25;01:20:32;"And I bet that a Jerry's Salt 8 day old gas station iced coffee"
01:20:32;01:20:38;"Probably has a smoother finish than a lot of these sour diesel cold brews"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"So yeah"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"He's an innovator, I mean let's face it"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"He's an innovator and as he also said"
01:20:44;01:20:45;"You know"
01:20:45;01:20:48;"I think he enjoys being provocative a little bit"
01:20:48;01:20:51;"But you know clearly this was a lot deeper than just coffee"
01:20:51;01:20:56;"And I appreciate him taking us into his kind of world view as a critic and as an artist"
01:20:56;01:20:59;"Coming up the rest of this episode just about is"
01:20:59;01:21:03;"An interview that I did with Ed O'Brien"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"Six weeks ago"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"And as people say all the time"
01:21:07;01:21:11;"Six weeks ago feels like another universe"
01:21:11;01:21:13;"I don't know if I totally buy that"
01:21:13;01:21:15;"But I get what people are saying when they're like"
01:21:15;01:21:17;"Holy s*** six weeks ago man"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"Even four weeks ago, three weeks ago"
01:21:19;01:21:21;"That was a totally different world"
01:21:21;01:21:25;"Yeah I mean maybe I'm still just holding on to some sort of misplaced optimism"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"About what the future will be like"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"But I'm kind of like yeah yeah"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"Obviously there wasn't a quarantine then but you know"
01:21:31;01:21:33;"Of course this is different now but anyway"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"So in some ways it was a very long time ago"
01:21:35;01:21:37;"Jake how familiar are you with Ed O'Brien?"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"I'm pretty familiar with him"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"You're in Radiohead right?"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"Well you're not that familiar with him Jake because he's a guitarist in Radiohead"
01:21:43;01:21:45;"Oh okay yeah you're right"
01:21:45;01:21:49;"Sorry I'm not trying to shame you but yeah he's a guitarist"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"He and Johnny Greenwood are the guitarists"
01:21:51;01:21:55;"Yeah I guess in like an old school band way"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"He's more of the rhythm guitarist but maybe that's not even true"
01:21:57;01:22:03;"He's just playing bar chords while Johnny Greenwood shreds solos over them"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"But they're not like a metal band so I'm sure like"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"No I'm just joking"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"Who's the bass player in Radiohead?"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"Colin Greenwood he's Johnny's brother"
01:22:11;01:22:15;"Right and then you got Phil Selway on drums"
01:22:15;01:22:19;"Yeah one thing about Ed that's cool is that in the context of Radiohead"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"His name sounds very Radiohead-y"
01:22:21;01:22:23;"But like if it was like a guy from Jersey"
01:22:23;01:22:27;"He's the only guy whose name could be a guy from like the East Coast"
01:22:27;01:22:29;"Like a Jersey guy"
01:22:29;01:22:31;"Ed O'Brien"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"Totally"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"Oh yeah Ed O'Brien"
01:22:37;01:22:39;"He played hockey at you know St. Dominic's or something"
01:22:39;01:22:45;"He runs a body shop doesn't he down in Bayonne?"
01:22:45;01:22:47;"Yeah Ed O'Brien"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"He's a Boston guy"
01:22:49;01:22:51;"Yeah I got this cousin Ed O'Brien"
01:22:51;01:22:53;"Anyway but Ed is a very elegant man"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"Very tech guy"
01:22:55;01:22:59;"And so I got a call about six weeks ago saying hey Ed's in town"
01:22:59;01:23:01;"He's doing some press for his first solo album"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"Which you know he's been playing with Radiohead for decades"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"So this is a big deal"
01:23:05;01:23:07;"His first solo album it's under the name EOB"
01:23:07;01:23:09;"Essentially Ed O'Brien"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"And I said would you want to interview him?"
01:23:11;01:23:13;"And I said yeah oh yeah"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"And I met Ed before and I always thought he was a cool guy"
01:23:15;01:23:17;"So it came together very last minute"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"And we didn't have access to the studio"
01:23:19;01:23:23;"So it turned into a thing where I basically interviewed him in my backyard"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"In person?"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"In person yeah"
01:23:27;01:23:29;"Since this interview was recorded"
01:23:29;01:23:31;"Apparently Ed got coronavirus"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"Sounds like he's doing okay"
01:23:33;01:23:37;"But it's interesting because we talk quite a bit about health and eating"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"And stuff"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"Because I basically you know going into the interview"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"I was like I think when somebody comes on"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"Crisis I like to ask them about you know"
01:23:45;01:23:47;"Time crisis topics to get the ball rolling"
01:23:47;01:23:49;"As I did with Jerry Saltz a little bit"
01:23:49;01:23:51;"So you know with Ed I was like I want to hear about"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"And even before he came in"
01:23:53;01:23:55;"I was like you know just so Ed knows"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"The things we talk about on the show"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"We don't always do like hardcore interviews"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"Like so what's going on with you"
01:24:01;01:24:03;"You know and they're like no that's cool"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"And I was like alright I'll probably ask him about"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"The Grateful Dead and they wrote back"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"Like yeah well Ed actually is more into fish"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"And I was like even better"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"I can't wait to hear about this"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"But I also knew I was going to ask him about"
01:24:15;01:24:17;"You know Flamin' Hot Cheetos and things like that"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"And that led to a whole discussion about health"
01:24:19;01:24:21;"And some of his struggles over the years"
01:24:21;01:24:23;"So I hope that his battle with coronavirus"
01:24:23;01:24:25;"COVID-19"
01:24:25;01:24:27;"Wasn't too terrible"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"And that he's doing well so that's good"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"But anyway this is my backyard interview"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"With Ed O'Brien"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"From six weeks ago"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"And you should check out his album"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"We were just talking about the last time we saw each other"
01:24:39;01:24:41;"It was at Glaston"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"Let me say it correctly Glastonbury"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"How do you say it?"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"Glastonbury what do you say? Glastonbury"
01:24:47;01:24:49;"You know Americans it's very tempting for us to say Glastonbury"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"You can say Glastonbury"
01:24:51;01:24:53;"Because we've got enough American acts"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"Like yourselves who come over and play it"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"Hey Glastonbury"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"It sounds wrong but it still doesn't feel right"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"To say Glastonbury"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"Does that sound correct? That sounds great"
01:25:03;01:25:05;"When I say that Glastonbury? Perfect"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"Glastonbury"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"So it was interesting the time that I saw you"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"Because at this point Vampire Weekends played four times"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"How many times has Radiohead? Five"
01:25:13;01:25:15;"Five? Five yeah"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"So we're actually neck and neck"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"I thought it would be more of a disparity"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"But the time I saw you was the only time I've ever gone"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"As a punter as English people say"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"So I had to check it out"
01:25:25;01:25:27;"And I had a great time and I saw you"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"And you go every year"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"Is it as a punter or is it weird to call an adult a punter?"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"No punter is perfect"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"So you go as a punter? I go as a punter"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"And I've been sort of the first one I went to was in 1990"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"As a punter"
01:25:39;01:25:41;"Well this is"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"The band weren't signed we had the band"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"And sort of I guess since then"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"Most years I've kind of gone"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"As a punter whether we play or not"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"And in fact I actually prefer it when we don't play"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"Because for me"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"And my wife"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"And our friends it's our carnival"
01:25:57;01:25:59;"We've got kids and we live sort of"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"Lives that are quite busy"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"And organised and a very"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"London life so Glastonbury"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"Gives us a place to"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"Literally go out and play be like kids again"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"And it's a funny thing"
01:26:11;01:26:13;"It feels like I've been talking"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"Quite a lot about this recently"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"It's more than just a festival"
01:26:17;01:26:19;"There's a power there that you tap into"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"That you"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"People have been doing this in that part of the country"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"In Britain"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"For thousands of years"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"Celebrating essentially midsummer the solstice"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"And that's what it taps into"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"That area of Britain is not far from Stonehenge"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"It's very old"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"Right and there's Glastonbury tour"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"Exactly"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"What is it it's a mound?"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"Yeah it's a mound with a little castle on top"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"That whole area where Glastonbury was used to be underwater"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"And Glastonbury tour"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"Used to be an island"
01:26:49;01:26:51;"Oh wow"
01:26:51;01:26:53;"So I guess when the sea levels were higher or something"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"And there's all this mythology"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Not mythology but all these stories"
01:26:57;01:26:59;"Of Joseph of Arimathea"
01:26:59;01:27:01;"Jesus' uncle"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"Visiting Glastonbury"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"And apparently there was an old"
01:27:05;01:27:07;"And the reason it was there was an old trade route"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"From Palestine, Middle East"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"There was this trade route"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"That they would come and trade tin in Cornwall"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"Because it had tin mines"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"It was an outpost of the Roman Empire"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"Right because of the Roman Empire"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"It's not crazy to imagine"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"Somebody from the Middle East"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"Could have made it to the British Isles"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"Exactly"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"Well like you just said the first time you went"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Was as a punter and then you played"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"For me coming from the US"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"I played it with Vampire Weekend three times"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"Before I went"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"And you know when you play sometimes you go out and check stuff out"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"But you know like you said it's such a different feeling"
01:27:41;01:27:43;"You're stressed out you've got to perform"
01:27:43;01:27:45;"You're on to the next thing usually because it's part of a tour"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"So to actually spend a full weekend"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"In the mud"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"Hang out all night"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"Not even worry about my voice or anything"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"It was really eye opening because"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"It can be so bewildering"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"When you're on tour"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"You suddenly get pushed out on stage"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"Especially at a festival you often don't even have a sound check"
01:28:03;01:28:05;"And you just like play and you bounce"
01:28:05;01:28:07;"And it's like you know you have this brief moment"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"Where you connect with the people there but then you're gone and they're there"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"So to actually see what it's like"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"To just be there"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"It made me appreciate it so much more"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"It's so true because on the touring thing"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"It's like you're popping your head above ground"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"For an hour or so an hour and a half"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"And then you're back down into your own little world"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"And you're taken on to the next place"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"Did you find"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"Because I think for us it's always"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"And you played the Pyramid Stage"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"We played there so we've done that three times now"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"And each time we play there it's always like nothing else"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"It's a bit like"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"It's so big"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"And you're so far from the front row"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"I think that must be the furthest stage"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"To front row stretch anywhere"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"Yeah it feels like"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"Half a football field or something"
01:28:49;01:28:51;"So you see pockets of movement and stuff"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"But it's almost too big to comprehend"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"Every time we've ever played I always walk off"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"In a slightly bad mood"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"And then one of our"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"And I'm willing to trust other people"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"Like someone from the label will be like ""Oh man it was great"""
01:29:03;01:29:05;"And I'll be like ""Yeah was it?"""
01:29:05;01:29:07;"And then I'll come back and if I talk to three or four people"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"They'll relax and say ""Oh yeah"""
01:29:09;01:29:11;"We had exactly the same"
01:29:11;01:29:13;"You come off that stage and you think ""We've blown it"""
01:29:13;01:29:15;"First time we played it we played it in '97"
01:29:15;01:29:17;"It was a torrential year"
01:29:17;01:29:19;"Like the other stage, the stage was sinking in the mud"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"And all this stuff"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"And it was our big"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"It was the biggest thing we'd ever done"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"OK Computer had just come out"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"And it was a nightmare"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"Tom's monitors went, all our monitors went"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"The lights went"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"And we couldn't hear"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"You'd go like after about the seventh song"
01:29:37;01:29:39;"He said ""By the way, just to let you know"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"I'm walking off after the next song"""
01:29:41;01:29:43;"And it was literally like"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"""Let's just do one more song, let's do 'Just'"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"'Just' is the next one, we can do 'Just'"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"We can play that, you know"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"And we came off and we thought we'd blown it"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"And we absolutely were like, we were crushed"
01:29:53;01:29:55;"And like you said, you come off"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"And then people go, Michael Evers said it was one of his"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"Favourite Glastonbury sets ever"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"It's weird, you never know at that place"
01:30:01;01:30:03;"Because I think you're so far"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"Removed from it, in a way"
01:30:05;01:30:07;"I'm not going back"
01:30:09;01:30:11;"To your house"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"I've burned it to the ground"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"That I live"
01:30:15;01:30:17;"And wrapped around your door"
01:30:17;01:30:19;"On the other side"
01:30:19;01:30:21;"Peace will never, never"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Live again"
01:30:35;01:30:37;"Live"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"Again"
01:30:51;01:30:53;"You know, there's no festival"
01:30:53;01:30:55;"Or no yearly festival"
01:30:55;01:30:57;"That quite has that Glastonbury"
01:30:57;01:30:59;"Mix of old and new and"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"Hippie and modern"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"But the thing that we have in the US"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"That you don't quite have in the UK"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"Is jam band culture"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"And so this is something we kind of ask"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"Everybody is, do you listen to the Grateful Dead?"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"Here's the thing"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"I don't listen to the Grateful Dead but"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"I love the jam band culture"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"And I know that you do"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"I had an epiphany with"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"Phish, three years ago"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"Three years ago?"
01:31:25;01:31:27;"2017"
01:31:27;01:31:29;"October the 31st, Las Vegas"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"Oh you went to their Halloween show?"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"Yeah"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"In the MGM Grand"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"So many questions"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"So before we get to that"
01:31:39;01:31:41;"One thing that's interesting is that"
01:31:41;01:31:43;"How old are you?"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"I'm 51"
01:31:45;01:31:47;"So you're kind of the same generation as those guys"
01:31:47;01:31:49;"They started in the early 80s"
01:31:49;01:31:51;"You guys started under a different name"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"Yeah, 85"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"High school"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"They're like four or five years older"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"So both bands came to"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"True prominence in the 90s"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"See that in common"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"So yeah, like we said"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"Jam band culture doesn't exist in the UK"
01:32:07;01:32:09;"You know, the Grateful Dead played there"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"They probably played in the UK 20 times"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"Over the course of four decades"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"Not really a big deal"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"But in the 90s, you guys are touring all over the world"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"Did you have much awareness of Phish then?"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"No, so here's the thing"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"And I'll tell you a bit about why"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"You might know this a bit"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"In Britain, when I grew up"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"Punk cast such a long shadow"
01:32:29;01:32:31;"Which was anti-jamming"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"And anti all of that"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"And almost anti-musicianship"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"Which is ridiculous"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"So anything that was vaguely"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"Like the Grateful Dead"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"I remember coming across the Grateful Dead"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"Because I travel around America by Greyhound in 1987"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"And in the summer of 1987"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"I end up in"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"Fort Mason Youth Hostel"
01:32:51;01:32:53;"In San Francisco"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"And the Youth Hostel"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"Was a solo trip"
01:32:57;01:32:59;"Where I did it with a school friend"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"My oldest friend"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"We did it together"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"And it was great"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"We went around America with one of those Ameripasses"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"For like six months"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"And it was amazing"
01:33:11;01:33:13;"I never heard of the Grateful Dead"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"And then suddenly this Youth Hostel"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"You literally hadn't heard of the Grateful Dead"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"In 1987"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"So I was weaned on"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"So my, you know the things"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"I was into at that stage were"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"The Smiths"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"U2, Echo and the Bunnymen"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"You know a bit of early hip hop"
01:33:31;01:33:33;"But in terms of"
01:33:33;01:33:35;"Bands like, I mean we"
01:33:35;01:33:37;"Hippies were a dirty word and I think there was an"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"Association with hippies"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"You know, Grateful Dead being hippies"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"It was reduced to very simplistic"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"Notion of what this band were"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"So I get to this Youth Hostel"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"And it was sort of"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"One generational and you know"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"People in their like 70s"
01:33:53;01:33:55;"And then teenagers my age"
01:33:55;01:33:57;"All in tie dyed and like what's going on"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"This great, this dead concert"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"And everybody was so nice and it was almost like"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"They were too nice"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"It seemed a bit cult like"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"Well it's that British thing that you know we're so uptight"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"A lot of the time that we're kind of sceptical"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"Of anybody who's really nice and warm"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"And like what do they want, you know"
01:34:13;01:34:15;"Would you like to come to Golden Gate Park"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"With us and have, well what do they want"
01:34:17;01:34:19;"You know sort of"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"Yeah especially your young dude traveling in a different country"
01:34:21;01:34:23;"You gotta watch your back"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"Yeah we had knives pulled on us but these were genuinely"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"Nice people, anyway it was"
01:34:27;01:34:29;"Grateful Dead were doing a concert there so"
01:34:29;01:34:31;"I hadn't really come across them and then"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"When we were touring in the 90s"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"We were still"
01:34:35;01:34:37;"Grateful Dead seemed"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"So sort of removed from"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"We were into a lot of American bands"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"But they weren't the Grateful Dead, they were the Pixies"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"They were R.E.M."
01:34:45;01:34:47;"Or the great Dinosaur Jr."
01:34:47;01:34:49;"They weren't, it was only"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"When I got older and it was"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"Somebody we worked with and the amount of touring"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"That we did in America"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"You start to understand it a bit more"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"Maybe when you start playing places"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"Like the Sheds right"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"And the arenas"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"And you start realizing the culture"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"Of this country and music"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"And I was saying this the other night, I think American audiences"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"Are"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"The most musical in a way"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"Because"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"They will go on a journey with you"
01:35:17;01:35:19;"You know, you don't have to fire out"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"Your greatest hits"
01:35:21;01:35:23;"Every night, they will go on a musical journey"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"And if you've got"
01:35:25;01:35:27;"Like on the last Radiohead tour we would do"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"Two shows in each city, two arenas and we'd do"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"A different setlist every night"
01:35:31;01:35:33;"And they'd be different every single night"
01:35:33;01:35:35;"And that was"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"And that was the first time you guys had really committed to that?"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"Yeah we'd done sort of"
01:35:39;01:35:41;"Different, we always did different sets"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"But the idea of playing a different set"
01:35:43;01:35:45;"Each night was kind of like"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"That was the awakening to the fact"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"That this is a culture that we can do that in"
01:35:49;01:35:51;"You wouldn't have felt as comfortable"
01:35:51;01:35:53;"Doing that in the UK or other places?"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"I guess"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"We would do now"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"But America is the kind of place that"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"Gives you the confidence to try it first of all"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"Right, I see"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"So then take me to Halloween 2017"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"You kind of found out about the dead a little bit"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"Yeah"
01:36:09;01:36:11;"But you were still not making a huge impression"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"And then you were somewhat"
01:36:13;01:36:15;"You must have been somewhat aware of Phish"
01:36:15;01:36:17;"But even then in the 90s they were kind of on their own trip"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"That's when they were doing their massive festivals"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"By themselves, I wonder how often you guys were even in the same place"
01:36:21;01:36:23;"Well there was a photographer friend"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"Called Danny Clinch"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"Danny's a good friend of Phish's"
01:36:27;01:36:29;"And he was a friend of ours"
01:36:29;01:36:31;"And he kept on telling me, he said ""Ed you've got to check this out"""
01:36:31;01:36:33;"And also the Bonnaroo thing"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"And we played Bonnaroo in 2006"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"The Jam Band Festival, when it was a Jam Band Festival"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"And loved it, we did like a three hour set"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"And it was like a kind of giddy warm night"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"And so the Phish concert happened"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"Because"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"I got the same management"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"Corrin Capshaw and Red Light"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"And I was on a road trip with my wife and my kids"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"In the South West"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"In that period"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"Three years ago, whatever"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"And Corrin said ""Oh, are you in Vegas on the 31st?"""
01:36:59;01:37:01;"And I said ""Yeah, so come along to the show"""
01:37:01;01:37:03;"So you were just planning on going to Vegas"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"Just to visit the family"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"One night we did the whole Sedona"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"Oh yeah, very crunchy town"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"Yeah, we did Joshua Tree"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"I love, I love, love, love"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"This country"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"Once you get out of the cities in America"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"I just think it's the most stunning"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"And to be in a car"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"And it was a really great thing for us as a family"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"And so we go to, we walk into the MGM Grand"
01:37:25;01:37:27;"That evening"
01:37:27;01:37:29;"And I walk in and I go"
01:37:29;01:37:31;"""This is pretty extraordinary, the atmosphere"""
01:37:31;01:37:33;"And I'm like ""Oh my god, this is amazing"""
01:37:33;01:37:35;"""It's pretty extraordinary, the atmosphere"""
01:37:35;01:37:37;"And then they go on"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"And they start playing, and then we see them do"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"Bowie had died that year"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"So they did the whole of Ziggy Stardust"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"Right, and also for people who don't know, this is a long running fish tradition"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"That one of their sets on Halloween"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"Is their musical costume where they cover an album"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"Yeah, so they've done the White Album"
01:37:51;01:37:53;"They did Ziggy Stardust our year"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"And they did it in sequence"
01:37:55;01:37:57;"Yeah"
01:37:57;01:37:59;"And it was brilliant, and I'd never been at a gig"
01:37:59;01:38:01;"Where you walk in"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"And the vibe, for want of a better word"
01:38:03;01:38:05;"Is warm"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"Welcoming"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"Celebratory"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"Musical"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"People are high"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"I'm like ""Oh my god, I love this"""
01:38:15;01:38:17;"I mean, you've done it right?"
01:38:17;01:38:19;"I've been to a couple now, and one thing that always struck me"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"Is that, you know"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"A handful of people have come up"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"And said hi or something"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"At a show like that, and it's very different than if you're at some other show"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"And somebody spots you, they might be like"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"""Hey man, could I get a picture?"""
01:38:31;01:38:33;"Or like, yeah, whatever"
01:38:33;01:38:35;"At that show, people said ""Oh man, it's really cool to see you here"""
01:38:35;01:38:37;"It's kind of like when you saw me at Glastonbury"
01:38:37;01:38:39;"It was kind of a welcoming thing"
01:38:39;01:38:41;"Not just ""Hey, look at you"""
01:38:41;01:38:43;"It was kind of just like ""I'm happy that you're here"""
01:38:43;01:38:45;"""I'm happy that you came to this environment"""
01:38:45;01:38:47;"And I think the vibe is like"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"I don't have a very long"
01:38:49;01:38:51;"Attention span for music"
01:38:51;01:38:53;"I don't think there's that many"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"Shows where I could actually handle"
01:38:55;01:38:57;"Being there for more than three hours"
01:38:57;01:38:59;"And there's something about the combination"
01:38:59;01:39:01;"Of the music and the crowd"
01:39:01;01:39:03;"And the vibe that makes it easy"
01:39:03;01:39:05;"That makes you happy to be there"
01:39:05;01:39:07;"You know, and it also"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"I saw Trey's other band, Trey Anastasio band"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"And I maybe knew"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"Like a third"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"Or maybe like half of it"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"There's a lot of stuff I didn't know"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"And you know, I used to be the type of person"
01:39:19;01:39:21;"I don't want to go see something if I don't know the songs, I'll be bored"
01:39:21;01:39:23;"And yet I was just like so happy to hang the whole time"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"Because it was like the right environment"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"To discover new music and look around"
01:39:27;01:39:29;"And it is, I don't know any fish music"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"But I would go to a fish gig every time"
01:39:31;01:39:33;"Because I knew nothing but I was"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"I'm the same, you want to have something you can hold on to"
01:39:35;01:39:37;"And so you and the guys had never met?"
01:39:37;01:39:39;"No, and I met them"
01:39:39;01:39:41;"Corin brought me backstage and I met Trey"
01:39:41;01:39:43;"And John and Paige"
01:39:43;01:39:45;"They've busted out some Radiohead over the years, haven't they?"
01:39:45;01:39:47;"I think so, I think they have"
01:39:47;01:39:49;"And Trey, I was really chuffed because I did this"
01:39:49;01:39:51;"Guitar with Fender, this Strat"
01:39:51;01:39:53;"This Susayna Strat"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"I actually used it"
01:39:55;01:39:57;"The only other guitar he's used apparently"
01:39:57;01:39:59;"Is the EOB Strat"
01:39:59;01:40:01;"But here's the thing"
01:40:01;01:40:03;"I saw you did something"
01:40:03;01:40:05;"You did a thing in one of the Sunday papers"
01:40:05;01:40:07;"And you did a podcast recommendation"
01:40:07;01:40:09;"And you, Long May They Run"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"Yes, oh you listened to it?"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"F*** man, I listened to it"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"It's my favourite podcast, I really liked"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"The band before that, afterwards"
01:40:17;01:40:19;"I f***ing love the band"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"It's extraordinary"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"How brave are they?"
01:40:23;01:40:25;"They played on the Millennium"
01:40:25;01:40:27;"Down in Florida"
01:40:27;01:40:29;"90,000 people"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"And all night set, there was nothing in the press"
01:40:31;01:40:33;"But they just do it"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"And they do it for their fans"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"And they do it for the music"
01:40:37;01:40:39;"It's just, I was on stage the other night"
01:40:39;01:40:41;"And I, because what I'm trying to do with this band"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"That I've got at the moment"
01:40:43;01:40:45;"I'm trying to do this thing where we"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"Have endings that we go to a place"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"We jam and I've been directly"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"Inspired by what Fish have said"
01:40:51;01:40:53;"About, yeah, about"
01:40:53;01:40:55;"Saying they go out there and it might not happen"
01:40:55;01:40:57;"For seven or eight minutes"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"And it might not even happen that evening"
01:40:59;01:41:01;"And it might not happen the next evening"
01:41:01;01:41:03;"But there's that moment of transcendental"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"Beauty, magic that happens"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"Can happen one night, and that's what"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Everybody's willing to be bold enough"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"To do that, and Radiohead"
01:41:11;01:41:13;"Have never done that"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"So Radiohead, have there ever been"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"Songs that you extend or do something"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"Different with live, or it's always pretty faithful"
01:41:19;01:41:21;"To the record? Well there's one, there's everything"
01:41:21;01:41:23;"In it's right place, which is kind of like"
01:41:23;01:41:25;"It's a track off Kid A"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"And it's a kind of a, it's free for"
01:41:27;01:41:29;"There's that live manipulation, do do do do"
01:41:29;01:41:31;"Yeah, exactly, all that stuff"
01:41:31;01:41:33;"And sampling, but the Radiohead"
01:41:33;01:41:35;"Songs have been, you know, arrangement"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"Is such a big part of it"
01:41:37;01:41:39;"That we don't know how to do it"
01:41:39;01:41:41;"And all the parts were worked out"
01:41:41;01:41:43;"You know, is that the future"
01:41:43;01:41:45;"For you, because that's the future for me"
01:41:45;01:41:47;"Because as a musician now, what I'm chasing now"
01:41:47;01:41:49;"Is different experiences"
01:41:49;01:41:51;"And new experiences, and that to me"
01:41:51;01:41:53;"Feels like the frontier"
01:41:53;01:41:55;"And I've come, listen, I've come from"
01:41:55;01:41:57;"Punk and post-punk in the UK, which"
01:41:57;01:41:59;"This is not where we, this is like"
01:41:59;01:42:01;"Two and a half, three minute songs"
01:42:01;01:42:03;"But as you get older or whatever, you kind of"
01:42:03;01:42:05;"Yeah I've done that, and of course there's a place"
01:42:05;01:42:07;"For those songs, but"
01:42:07;01:42:09;"It's not too dissimilar as well to"
01:42:09;01:42:11;"The thing that I liken it to is a bit like"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"Rave and dance culture"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"You know a DJ back in the day"
01:42:15;01:42:17;"I don't know if they still do, I don't know what"
01:42:17;01:42:19;"EDM's like here, but"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"A DJ would play, would respond"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"To the vibe of the audience"
01:42:23;01:42:25;"And the gig, and that to me"
01:42:25;01:42:27;"Is the exciting place where"
01:42:27;01:42:29;"There's something happening that night"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"And you try and gauge it"
01:42:31;01:42:33;"And you feel it, and you go, okay"
01:42:33;01:42:35;"I guess it's like musical surfing"
01:42:35;01:42:37;"We're gonna ride this wave, let's see where this takes us"
01:42:37;01:42:39;"That's where I'm really"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"Interested in, and it's that bit where"
01:42:41;01:42:43;"Kind of fish meets rave"
01:42:43;01:42:45;"Totally, and I think that comparison you draw"
01:42:45;01:42:47;"Is very apt, and certainly in the US"
01:42:47;01:42:49;"There's 100%"
01:42:49;01:42:51;"A fan base that"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"Enjoys both those things, if you went to a festival that"
01:42:53;01:42:55;"For lack of a better word is kind of like"
01:42:55;01:42:57;"A hippie crunchy festival, 100%"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"There's electronic music"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"Stuff you'd call EDM"
01:43:01;01:43:03;"That specifically lives in that world"
01:43:03;01:43:05;"I think there's definitely"
01:43:05;01:43:07;"An improvisatory"
01:43:07;01:43:09;"Electronic dance music culture"
01:43:09;01:43:11;"That still is influenced"
01:43:11;01:43:13;"By the jam band world"
01:43:13;01:43:17;"This bad dream has got me"
01:43:17;01:43:25;"Falling like I'm falling live"
01:43:25;01:43:33;"It's in me and it's in you"
01:43:42;01:43:46;"As above and so below"
01:43:46;01:43:54;"Falling like I'm falling live"
01:43:54;01:44:02;"How much more of this to take"
01:44:02;01:44:10;"To see you smile and laugh again"
01:44:10;01:44:12;"This is your first album?"
01:44:12;01:44:14;"Yeah"
01:44:14;01:44:16;"Anything else that you had under a different name"
01:44:16;01:44:18;"Or that you, besides Radiohead?"
01:44:18;01:44:20;"Yeah, not really"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"This is the point, I didn't know how to write"
01:44:22;01:44:24;"I didn't know how to write"
01:44:24;01:44:26;"And I didn't realise, I had lots of"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"Little musical motifs"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"But I mean, kind of ridiculously"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"I don't know why I didn't ever sit down with Tom and say"
01:44:32;01:44:34;"How do you do it?"
01:44:34;01:44:36;"You know?"
01:44:36;01:44:38;"Because I think it's probably that pride in bands"
01:44:38;01:44:40;"You don't ask for help"
01:44:40;01:44:42;"Or you don't ask for your like"
01:44:42;01:44:44;"And also, this guy"
01:44:44;01:44:46;"To my left, Tom"
01:44:46;01:44:48;"Been writing songs at school since he was 12"
01:44:48;01:44:50;"And like anything that I started writing"
01:44:50;01:44:52;"It's like, well it's not as good as Street Spirit"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"You know?"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"The high bar"
01:44:56;01:44:58;"But what you didn't realise is the process"
01:44:58;01:45:00;"That took him to get to Street Spirit"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"So he might present the song"
01:45:02;01:45:04;"In its form"
01:45:04;01:45:06;"Like two years after"
01:45:06;01:45:08;"He'd started that process"
01:45:08;01:45:10;"So that for me was"
01:45:10;01:45:12;"Right, you're saying the edited, finished"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"Exactly, so that for me was a big thing"
01:45:14;01:45:16;"Finding out, and so I had all these chunks"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"And I've got cassettes of"
01:45:18;01:45:20;"Stuff like back in the 90s around OK Computer"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"But I didn't know how to"
01:45:22;01:45:24;"Fit those chunks together"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"Or how to do it"
01:45:26;01:45:28;"What was your attitude about that?"
01:45:28;01:45:30;"I mean, you've always struck me as a laid back dude"
01:45:30;01:45:32;"Like, was your vibe kind of like"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"Well, alright"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"Like sometimes there's people"
01:45:36;01:45:38;"And bands can feel like, I've got to do something else"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"Is it because you're a laid back dude"
01:45:40;01:45:42;"That you were chill with waiting"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"Until you started to like"
01:45:44;01:45:46;"See the, you know"
01:45:46;01:45:48;"Feel the right inspiration"
01:45:48;01:45:50;"Or were you just so busy it didn't matter?"
01:45:50;01:45:52;"I was so busy"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"I literally, the whole family thing"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"I wanted to be"
01:45:56;01:45:58;"You were on tour in the studio with Ray Dad"
01:45:58;01:46:00;"Or you were a home-grown dad"
01:46:00;01:46:02;"I wanted to be a dad"
01:46:02;01:46:04;"You know the writer J.G. Ballard"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"Sure, yeah"
01:46:06;01:46:08;"He raised his kids on his own"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"Oh, I didn't know that"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"He raised three kids and he would write at night"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"After he put the kids to bed"
01:46:14;01:46:16;"And he'd make sure that they got off to school"
01:46:16;01:46:18;"And he'd do all their meals and stuff"
01:46:18;01:46:20;"And he would write"
01:46:20;01:46:22;"And I thought that was the noblest thing"
01:46:22;01:46:24;"You know, because the story is"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"Most people in our game, it's like"
01:46:26;01:46:28;"The art comes first"
01:46:28;01:46:30;"I am a f***ing artist"
01:46:30;01:46:32;"I'm some famously bad parents"
01:46:32;01:46:34;"Exactly"
01:46:34;01:46:36;"In the music world"
01:46:36;01:46:38;"That's what I wanted to do, I wanted to be a dad"
01:46:38;01:46:40;"I've found, you know"
01:46:40;01:46:42;"My brief experience as a parent too"
01:46:42;01:46:44;"It's like, it's kind of like with anything"
01:46:44;01:46:46;"It is, you're always better at doing something"
01:46:46;01:46:48;"When, whether it's for an afternoon"
01:46:48;01:46:50;"A morning, a day, a week"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"To say, this is what I'm doing this week"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"Because music and creative stuff"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"Has a way of like"
01:46:56;01:46:58;"It's a little bit like when your battery"
01:46:58;01:47:00;"Is drained and then you look at your phone"
01:47:00;01:47:02;"And it's like, well I've had that app open in the background"
01:47:02;01:47:04;"This whole time"
01:47:04;01:47:06;"Like, you know, sometimes you just gotta close it"
01:47:06;01:47:08;"And you just get nervous, do you want to?"
01:47:08;01:47:10;"But you know, you gotta focus on stuff"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"Here's the thing, I think it's good"
01:47:12;01:47:14;"I think, I say this to a lot of people"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"Don't be scared of being a full-time parent"
01:47:16;01:47:18;"And don't be scared of like"
01:47:18;01:47:20;"Whilst your children are young"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"Your creative output isn't as big or as great"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"As it was before, because I believe"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"Like, in the long run"
01:47:26;01:47:28;"In terms of, you feed that humanity"
01:47:28;01:47:30;"Back into your music"
01:47:30;01:47:32;"And that's the most, and there's"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"Something very, very humbling about being a parent"
01:47:34;01:47:36;"Because it's the most amazing thing"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"But it's supremely challenging"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"For me, it was like, you know"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"It was like a mirror on all my Achilles heels"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"All the things, all my weaknesses"
01:47:44;01:47:46;"And I had to sort my sh*t out"
01:47:46;01:47:48;"And it wasn't easy"
01:47:48;01:47:50;"Like, that stuff isn't easy, but you have to do it"
01:47:50;01:47:52;"And being an artist is about"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"Feeding that humanity back"
01:47:54;01:47:56;"What am I trying to say?"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"That humanity is really important"
01:47:58;01:48:00;"It feeds your art and it nourishes in a way"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"That gives you longevity"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"So, I mean, obviously it's not a coincidence"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"But it sounds like it perfectly fits your world view"
01:48:06;01:48:08;"To be releasing your debut album at this juncture"
01:48:08;01:48:10;"Yeah, totally"
01:48:10;01:48:12;"With kids in their teens"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"And you know, having toured all around the world"
01:48:14;01:48:16;"With this other band"
01:48:16;01:48:18;"It's like, this is the moment"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"And so many things like, the experiences"
01:48:20;01:48:22;"Or influences on the record have been because"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"So one might be reading a book"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"I read this amazing book to our kids"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"By a writer called William Nicholson"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"Which is a trilogy called the Wind on Fire trilogy"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"It's extraordinary"
01:48:32;01:48:34;"It's sort of, do you know the Philip Pullman books?"
01:48:34;01:48:36;"Yes, like Golden Compass"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"Yeah, it's like that"
01:48:38;01:48:40;"It's like"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"It's Lord of the Rings"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"And I think he got an Oscar for it"
01:48:44;01:48:46;"He wrote the screenplay to Gladiator"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"But he wrote this incredible book"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"That when I was reading it, I was in tears"
01:48:50;01:48:52;"And the third one is this family"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"And it's in a sort of another world"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"But that informs one of the songs"
01:48:56;01:48:58;"Another time was I was taking the kids down to the IMAX"
01:48:58;01:49:00;"At half ten in the morning"
01:49:00;01:49:02;"To go and see this film about"
01:49:02;01:49:04;"That NASA did on the re-commissioning of the Space Shuttle"
01:49:04;01:49:06;"To go and see when they fixed the Hubble Telescope"
01:49:06;01:49:08;"That afternoon I was so inspired"
01:49:08;01:49:10;"I went back and a song came out"
01:49:10;01:49:12;"You know"
01:49:12;01:49:14;"So it's for me"
01:49:14;01:49:16;"To put my place"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"Rather than"
01:49:18;01:49:20;"To put my place"
01:49:20;01:49:22;"Rather than go like to shut myself off"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"And go like right now I have to create"
01:49:24;01:49:26;"Certainly there are times you have to do that"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"But to be fluid and to allow"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"That kind of cross pollination"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"Between family and creativity"
01:49:32;01:49:34;"And it's been"
01:49:34;01:49:36;"For me it's been so enriching"
01:49:36;01:49:38;"And inspiring"
01:49:38;01:49:40;"I'd be remiss not to ask you about"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"Some classic time crisis stuff"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"I imagine at home"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"Correct me if I'm wrong"
01:49:46;01:49:48;"You're very healthy"
01:49:48;01:49:50;"Vegetarian or vegan"
01:49:50;01:49:52;"Well I was for about five years"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"And then I collapsed"
01:49:54;01:49:56;"Because I got chilled to the bone"
01:49:56;01:49:58;"Meaning you physically collapsed"
01:49:58;01:50:00;"Yeah I couldn't get up out of bed one day"
01:50:00;01:50:02;"I'd been a vegan for five years"
01:50:02;01:50:04;"You like felt paralyzed"
01:50:04;01:50:06;"Or you felt so weak"
01:50:06;01:50:08;"What was going through your head"
01:50:08;01:50:10;"What did you think was happening"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"Well I'd suffered from bad back earlier in my year"
01:50:12;01:50:14;"When I was younger"
01:50:14;01:50:16;"And I'd been out for a walk the day before"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"On top of the mountains"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"And I basically got chilled to the bone"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"And I couldn't my circulation was so bad"
01:50:22;01:50:24;"Like you were literally chilled to the bone"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"I was literally chilled to the bone"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"It didn't matter how you know"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"And did you have a feeling when you went to sleep that night"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"You were like yeah I was outside too much today"
01:50:32;01:50:34;"I just felt exhausted"
01:50:34;01:50:36;"And I didn't know what it was"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"And in the little Welsh town"
01:50:38;01:50:40;"It's quite an eccentric little place"
01:50:40;01:50:42;"This guy came around and he did emergency acupuncture"
01:50:42;01:50:44;"He's like a Chinese doctor"
01:50:44;01:50:46;"And he said what do you eat"
01:50:46;01:50:48;"And I said oh I'm a vegan"
01:50:48;01:50:50;"And he said he laughed"
01:50:50;01:50:52;"He said I came out here 15 years ago and I was a vegan"
01:50:52;01:50:54;"And he said you won't last the winter"
01:50:54;01:50:56;"I didn't know it was especially hard for Welsh vegans"
01:50:56;01:50:58;"Yeah"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"Well here's the other thing"
01:51:00;01:51:04;"So about four months later"
01:51:04;01:51:06;"I get my blood test done"
01:51:06;01:51:08;"And I'm type O"
01:51:08;01:51:10;"And there's a whole train of thoughts"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"About eating to your blood type"
01:51:12;01:51:14;"Are you aware of that?"
01:51:14;01:51:16;"Yes I've heard about this"
01:51:16;01:51:18;"So blood O need protein"
01:51:18;01:51:20;"And they need apparently a bit of meat"
01:51:20;01:51:22;"And I was very reluctant"
01:51:22;01:51:24;"However I was back out in Wales"
01:51:24;01:51:26;"And I thought there's a local farm"
01:51:26;01:51:28;"Organic, they're humanely kept the lamb"
01:51:28;01:51:30;"And I had some roast lamb"
01:51:30;01:51:32;"I cooked some lamb"
01:51:32;01:51:34;"And it was like this inner heat in me"
01:51:34;01:51:36;"And it was just like"
01:51:36;01:51:38;"Oh okay"
01:51:38;01:51:40;"And it was telling me I actually need it"
01:51:40;01:51:42;"So basically what I am now is I'm essentially a vegan"
01:51:42;01:51:44;"But I now feel when I need"
01:51:44;01:51:46;"Some meat"
01:51:46;01:51:48;"And what I do is"
01:51:48;01:51:50;"I made the mistake or maybe the good fortune"
01:51:50;01:51:52;"Of reading that book by Eric Schlosser"
01:51:52;01:51:54;"Fast Food Nation"
01:51:54;01:51:56;"I've never eaten meat in America since"
01:51:56;01:51:58;"Apart from the places where you get"
01:51:58;01:52:00;"A good organic or whatever"
01:52:00;01:52:02;"But I'm very very careful where I eat the meat"
01:52:02;01:52:04;"And so I'll have it occasionally"
01:52:04;01:52:06;"And do you lean towards lamb?"
01:52:06;01:52:08;"Or do you just go like well you know"
01:52:08;01:52:10;"They don't factory farm lamb"
01:52:10;01:52:12;"Lamb or beef"
01:52:12;01:52:14;"It's like a red meat"
01:52:14;01:52:16;"That's what they specifically say for typos"
01:52:16;01:52:18;"You just need that"
01:52:18;01:52:20;"So when's the last time you crushed some Doritos?"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"Well I had"
01:52:22;01:52:24;"Probably Christmas"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"Was that a Christmas present to yourself?"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"Yeah here's the deal"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"Did somebody get you the Doritos as a gift?"
01:52:30;01:52:32;"Uh"
01:52:32;01:52:34;"I think we have the equivalent"
01:52:34;01:52:36;"Of Doritos"
01:52:36;01:52:38;"Like you know"
01:52:38;01:52:40;"They're like essentially tortilla chips right?"
01:52:40;01:52:42;"Yes except and originally in the US"
01:52:42;01:52:44;"Doritos were just sold as tortilla chips"
01:52:44;01:52:46;"But now they're almost always flavoured"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"Like there's Cool Ranch"
01:52:48;01:52:50;"Yeah exactly"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"Here's the other thing"
01:52:52;01:52:54;"I don't know if you've ever heard of this thing called Candida"
01:52:54;01:52:56;"Yes"
01:52:56;01:52:58;"I had that for years"
01:52:58;01:53:00;"I had low energy, depression"
01:53:00;01:53:02;"And sort of chronic fatigue"
01:53:02;01:53:04;"Had it for years and so much of it"
01:53:04;01:53:06;"It got ridiculous"
01:53:06;01:53:08;"2006 it was ridiculous"
01:53:08;01:53:10;"I drive down to Oxford to rehearse"
01:53:10;01:53:12;"From London with Radiohead"
01:53:12;01:53:14;"Then it was an hour and a half"
01:53:14;01:53:16;"And we'd have"
01:53:16;01:53:18;"We were always well looked after"
01:53:18;01:53:20;"There was always lots of coffee and cake and stuff like that"
01:53:20;01:53:22;"And I'd load up on all of that stuff"
01:53:22;01:53:24;"All this sugary stuff"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"And I'd drive back at about 5.30 in the afternoon back to London"
01:53:26;01:53:28;"And I'd have to stop half way for a sleep"
01:53:28;01:53:30;"My energy was so bad"
01:53:30;01:53:32;"Yeah and I thought"
01:53:32;01:53:34;"Something wrong here"
01:53:34;01:53:36;"I went to see a functional medicine doctor"
01:53:36;01:53:38;"And he did blood tests"
01:53:38;01:53:40;"And he said you've got Candida"
01:53:40;01:53:42;"I'm not surprised"
01:53:42;01:53:44;"And he showed me my blood"
01:53:44;01:53:46;"And there were no other symptoms just the fatigue"
01:53:46;01:53:48;"Fatigue, depression"
01:53:48;01:53:50;"It's a really massive thing"
01:53:50;01:53:52;"So my whole tip since 2006"
01:53:52;01:53:54;"Is trying to take out sugar, wheat, dairy"
01:53:54;01:53:56;"All that stuff"
01:53:56;01:53:58;"And you know this is all well trodden stuff"
01:53:58;01:54:00;"But it's had a profound effect"
01:54:00;01:54:02;"On my energy"
01:54:02;01:54:04;"And I started doing these things as well"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"Like every year"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"In 2007 to 2012"
01:54:08;01:54:10;"Every year I'd do a water fast"
01:54:10;01:54:12;"Where I would just drink water"
01:54:12;01:54:14;"For 7 days not eat anything"
01:54:14;01:54:16;"Really? Nothing but water for 7 days?"
01:54:16;01:54:18;"Nothing but water"
01:54:18;01:54:20;"Do you have like visions and stuff?"
01:54:20;01:54:22;"Well"
01:54:22;01:54:24;"I'll tell you it's funny"
01:54:24;01:54:26;"So I picked up this book about"
01:54:26;01:54:28;"It was this old book someone gave me"
01:54:28;01:54:30;"And I opened up"
01:54:30;01:54:32;"And it was about staying in good health"
01:54:32;01:54:34;"And it opened up on the page on water fasting"
01:54:34;01:54:36;"Like how old?"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"It's like 60 years old"
01:54:38;01:54:40;"And when you realise I come from a family of osteopaths"
01:54:40;01:54:42;"And doctors"
01:54:42;01:54:44;"And my father's been very interested"
01:54:44;01:54:46;"In osteopathy"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"And in nutrition"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"And 80 years ago"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"If you went to osteopathic college in America"
01:54:52;01:54:54;"They taught you about nutrition"
01:54:54;01:54:56;"Everybody did fast"
01:54:56;01:54:58;"That was part of maintaining a good"
01:54:58;01:55:00;"Healthy lifestyle"
01:55:00;01:55:02;"And people would fast once a year"
01:55:02;01:55:04;"Or twice a year particularly changing seasons"
01:55:04;01:55:06;"Right and also almost every"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"Religion including the very ancient ones"
01:55:08;01:55:10;"Has some tradition of fasting"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"Exactly so I did this water fast"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"And the first 3 days"
01:55:14;01:55:16;"Like first of all you realise"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"That eating is kind of like a habit"
01:55:18;01:55:20;"It just takes up time in the day too"
01:55:20;01:55:22;"Yeah it does"
01:55:22;01:55:24;"So you were just home off tour"
01:55:24;01:55:26;"Yeah I was in London"
01:55:26;01:55:28;"The third day I'm like I think I'm gonna die"
01:55:28;01:55:30;"I'm feeling so bad"
01:55:30;01:55:32;"And I sort of literally get a cab"
01:55:32;01:55:34;"Because I'm craving being in nature"
01:55:34;01:55:36;"And the only nature in North London is Hampstead Heath"
01:55:36;01:55:38;"So I go to Hampstead Heath"
01:55:38;01:55:40;"And I literally walk from bench to bench"
01:55:40;01:55:42;"And I think this is rubbish I'm gonna stop this"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"The next day I wake up"
01:55:44;01:55:46;"And I'm awake and alive"
01:55:46;01:55:48;"Like I've never been before"
01:55:48;01:55:50;"Right you're like mentally sharp"
01:55:50;01:55:52;"But it was like"
01:55:52;01:55:54;"Almost like that William Blake thing"
01:55:54;01:55:56;"I felt like the wonder of life"
01:55:56;01:55:58;"It was extraordinary"
01:55:58;01:56:00;"And I was like that for days"
01:56:00;01:56:02;"My only knowledge is like taking ecstasy"
01:56:02;01:56:04;"It was literally"
01:56:04;01:56:06;"That kind of high"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"Feeling more connected to everything in nature"
01:56:08;01:56:10;"Totally"
01:56:10;01:56:12;"More like generosity of spirit"
01:56:12;01:56:14;"Totally and I had totally everything"
01:56:14;01:56:16;"And I went into the centre of London"
01:56:16;01:56:18;"And I remember walking around and going oh my god"
01:56:18;01:56:20;"Because you get these connections"
01:56:20;01:56:22;"And your smell is so sensitive"
01:56:22;01:56:24;"And I'd smell and I'd go"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"We're a society obsessed"
01:56:26;01:56:28;"With eating and consumption"
01:56:28;01:56:30;"Because everything smells"
01:56:30;01:56:32;"You're like drawn in that"
01:56:32;01:56:34;"You walk past something it smells"
01:56:34;01:56:36;"It's all about feed feed feed"
01:56:36;01:56:38;"And so I thought right I'm gonna do this"
01:56:38;01:56:40;"Every year second time I did it"
01:56:40;01:56:42;"The next year I was chasing that experience"
01:56:42;01:56:44;"You know in life"
01:56:44;01:56:46;"Similar to drugs like first time so fun"
01:56:46;01:56:48;"Second time and it wasn't the same"
01:56:48;01:56:50;"You know you get your ass kicked"
01:56:50;01:56:52;"You were chasing an experience"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"But it's"
01:56:54;01:56:56;"So for me what I'm trying to say"
01:56:56;01:56:58;"Is like how I eat now"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"I won't go to McDonald's to eat a burger"
01:57:00;01:57:02;"If that's the only food I just"
01:57:02;01:57:04;"I don't need to eat"
01:57:04;01:57:06;"Because I know what that does to me"
01:57:06;01:57:08;"I know what that does to my energy"
01:57:08;01:57:10;"That just pulls me right down"
01:57:10;01:57:12;"So I'm guessing you probably never had"
01:57:12;01:57:14;"Have you ever had any Cheetos?"
01:57:14;01:57:16;"What are Cheetos?"
01:57:16;01:57:18;"You don't know what Cheetos are?"
01:57:18;01:57:20;"They're made by Frito-Lay who makes Fritos"
01:57:20;01:57:22;"Oh I know Fritos"
01:57:22;01:57:24;"It's the same company"
01:57:24;01:57:26;"It's a puffed corn thing"
01:57:26;01:57:28;"With orange cheese around it"
01:57:28;01:57:30;"And their mascot is"
01:57:30;01:57:32;"Chester"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"He's a cheetah"
01:57:34;01:57:36;"Oh ok there you go"
01:57:36;01:57:38;"You must have your"
01:57:38;01:57:40;"You have weird stuff like Monster Munch"
01:57:40;01:57:42;"We had Wotsits"
01:57:42;01:57:44;"The cheesy ones"
01:57:44;01:57:46;"And that was the advert"
01:57:46;01:57:48;"And they were the same kind of"
01:57:48;01:57:50;"Monster Munch"
01:57:50;01:57:52;"Crunchy texture"
01:57:52;01:57:54;"So these are cheesy and there's these ones"
01:57:54;01:57:56;"Flaming hot"
01:57:56;01:57:58;"It's actually an interesting story"
01:57:58;01:58:00;"The guy who was initially a janitor at Frito-Lay"
01:58:00;01:58:02;"He had this idea"
01:58:02;01:58:04;"To make them spicier"
01:58:04;01:58:06;"And now he's kind of this legend"
01:58:06;01:58:08;"There's going to be a movie about him"
01:58:08;01:58:10;"His name is Richard Montanez"
01:58:10;01:58:12;"What's your fascination with this?"
01:58:12;01:58:14;"A big part of it is the story"
01:58:14;01:58:16;"Because it's such an unusual story"
01:58:16;01:58:18;"And he's a very inspiring guy"
01:58:18;01:58:20;"But also I think"
01:58:20;01:58:22;"On the show a lot of our fascination"
01:58:22;01:58:24;"With food"
01:58:24;01:58:26;"Stuff related to food"
01:58:26;01:58:28;"Is the advertising element"
01:58:28;01:58:30;"Because the truth is"
01:58:30;01:58:32;"On our show we're not particularly like foodies"
01:58:32;01:58:34;"It's always more about the cultural"
01:58:34;01:58:36;"Almost sociological aspect"
01:58:36;01:58:38;"Of these foods that everybody has"
01:58:38;01:58:40;"Marketed and sold to us and become part of our lives"
01:58:40;01:58:42;"That's like the more interesting part"
01:58:42;01:58:44;"Than the food itself"
01:58:44;01:58:46;"We should probably wrap it up"
01:58:46;01:58:48;"Thanks so much for coming through"
01:58:48;01:58:50;"Thank you Ezra"
01:58:50;01:58:52;"Great having you"
01:58:52;01:58:54;"Somebody will"
01:58:54;01:58:56;"Somebody won't"
01:58:56;01:59:00;"Somebody do and somebody don't"
01:59:00;01:59:04;"All our lives played out so"
01:59:04;01:59:08;"Intersecting the greatest flow"
01:59:08;01:59:12;"Every sight, every sound"
01:59:12;01:59:16;"And everything that goes around"
01:59:16;01:59:20;"The kaleidoscope start to spin"
01:59:20;01:59:22;"Gotta shake it up"
01:59:22;01:59:24;"All the mess we're in"
01:59:24;01:59:26;"Gotta shake it up"
01:59:26;01:59:28;"All the mess we're in"
01:59:28;01:59:30;"Shout out to Ed O'Brien"
01:59:30;01:59:32;"Thanks for coming through to the Backyard"
01:59:32;01:59:34;"Jake, before we say goodbye"
01:59:34;01:59:36;"We referenced when we talked to"
01:59:36;01:59:38;"Jerry Saltz, the death of Bill Withers"
01:59:38;01:59:40;"It's hard to keep up"
01:59:40;01:59:42;"These are very chaotic times"
01:59:42;01:59:44;"And there's been quite a few notable deaths lately"
01:59:44;01:59:46;"Some related to COVID-19"
01:59:46;01:59:48;"Certainly not all"
01:59:48;01:59:50;"In addition to Bill Withers dying"
01:59:50;01:59:52;"We also lost John Pryne"
01:59:52;01:59:54;"So Jake, John Pryne"
01:59:54;01:59:56;"I've only been aware of him for"
01:59:56;01:59:58;"Been listening to him maybe like a year"
01:59:58;02:00:00;"I always kind of knew the name"
02:00:00;02:00:02;"But I didn't go too deep"
02:00:02;02:00:04;"John Pryne seems really like in your wheelhouse"
02:00:04;02:00:06;"Tasteful 70's"
02:00:06;02:00:08;"Country rock"
02:00:08;02:00:10;"How do you even describe his music?"
02:00:10;02:00:12;"Yeah, I would say more like folk country"
02:00:12;02:00:14;"Maybe like a slight"
02:00:14;02:00:16;"Tinge of rock in there"
02:00:16;02:00:18;"Yeah, you know, it's funny"
02:00:18;02:00:20;"There's kind of a nice resonance"
02:00:20;02:00:22;"After talking to Jerry Saltz"
02:00:22;02:00:24;"Because Jerry was talking about being a long distance"
02:00:24;02:00:26;"Truck driver for many years"
02:00:26;02:00:28;"Before he started to become a professional"
02:00:28;02:00:30;"Art critic"
02:00:30;02:00:32;"John Pryne was a mailman in his early days"
02:00:32;02:00:34;"Oh wow"
02:00:34;02:00:36;"At least wrote the lyrics to many of his songs"
02:00:36;02:00:38;"On his first two albums"
02:00:38;02:00:40;"In his head while he was on his route"
02:00:40;02:00:42;"Which I always loved"
02:00:42;02:00:44;"As an image of just a guy"
02:00:44;02:00:46;"Deep in thought"
02:00:46;02:00:48;"While he was delivering mail"
02:00:48;02:00:50;"And carefully constructing these lyrics"
02:00:50;02:00:52;"Because his songs are very narrative"
02:00:52;02:00:54;"And they're really funny"
02:00:54;02:00:56;"And they're really sad"
02:00:56;02:00:58;"And you know what's strange about that"
02:00:58;02:01:00;"I'd been meaning forever"
02:01:00;02:01:02;"I'd always heard that this documentary"
02:01:02;02:01:04;"Still Bill about Bill Withers"
02:01:04;02:01:06;"Was really good"
02:01:06;02:01:08;"So with his tragic passing"
02:01:08;02:01:10;"I was like, gotta watch Still Bill"
02:01:10;02:01:12;"It's mostly just a portrait of him"
02:01:12;02:01:14;"After he left the music industry"
02:01:14;02:01:16;"And he's a very thoughtful guy"
02:01:16;02:01:18;"Like I said earlier"
02:01:18;02:01:20;"He entered music in his early 30s"
02:01:20;02:01:22;"And dipped by his mid 40s"
02:01:22;02:01:24;"So he has a pretty unusual story"
02:01:24;02:01:26;"And before he became a musician"
02:01:26;02:01:28;"He was like an airplane mechanic"
02:01:28;02:01:30;"And they show clips of videos"
02:01:30;02:01:32;"Where he's talking about"
02:01:32;02:01:34;"What would you do before this"
02:01:34;02:01:36;"And he's like, I had a good job man"
02:01:36;02:01:38;"I built toilets for airplanes"
02:01:38;02:01:40;"And people are kind of like, whoa"
02:01:40;02:01:42;"That's a good job, I liked it"
02:01:42;02:01:44;"It was cool"
02:01:44;02:01:46;"And at some point he basically says the same thing"
02:01:46;02:01:48;"Where he's like, you know in fact"
02:01:48;02:01:50;"I think I wrote a lot of my songs"
02:01:50;02:01:52;"When I was just working"
02:01:52;02:01:54;"And he kind of lists a lot of his biggest songs"
02:01:54;02:01:56;"Like the central words"
02:01:56;02:01:58;"I don't know if he was literally developing the chords"
02:01:58;02:02:00;"Or he was just kind of working"
02:02:00;02:02:02;"He was like, you know sunshine once he's gone"
02:02:02;02:02:04;"That sounds like a song, I don't know"
02:02:04;02:02:06;"But it's actually a very similar story"
02:02:06;02:02:08;"These two guys who recently died"
02:02:08;02:02:10;"Both working jobs that had nothing to do"
02:02:10;02:02:12;"With the music industry"
02:02:12;02:02:14;"And I guess slowly"
02:02:14;02:02:16;"Just as they're doing other work"
02:02:16;02:02:18;"Thinking about words and ideas for songs"
02:02:18;02:02:20;"And then they became two very iconic American songwriters"
02:02:20;02:02:22;"Yeah I guess if you can"
02:02:22;02:02:24;"Work by yourself"
02:02:24;02:02:26;"And your job gives you the mental bandwidth"
02:02:26;02:02:28;"To think about other things"
02:02:28;02:02:30;"You can really get a lot done"
02:02:30;02:02:32;"With your creative life"
02:02:32;02:02:34;"And Mailman particularly seems like a good job"
02:02:34;02:02:36;"Because it's like, you're probably seeing"
02:02:36;02:02:38;"Glimpses of people's lives"
02:02:38;02:02:40;"And he writes songs about people"
02:02:40;02:02:42;"He wrote a lot of famous story songs"
02:02:42;02:02:44;"So you can imagine"
02:02:44;02:02:46;"He's like, jobbing off some mail"
02:02:46;02:02:48;"He's like a 20-something guy"
02:02:48;02:02:50;"Sitting in a porch, he's like, what's that guy's deal?"
02:02:50;02:02:52;"He's just back from Vietnam"
02:02:52;02:02:54;"I'm gonna write a song about"
02:02:54;02:02:56;"Is that guy on drugs? Whose house is this?"
02:02:56;02:02:58;"Do you have a favorite John Prine song?"
02:02:58;02:03:00;"I think it's a song called"
02:03:00;02:03:02;"Sweet Revenge"
02:03:02;02:03:04;"Is that from the 70s?"
02:03:04;02:03:06;"I think it's from his third album"
02:03:06;02:03:08;"I think it's from like '72 or '73"
02:03:08;02:03:10;"It's killer"
02:03:10;02:03:12;"Let's leave it off with Sweet Revenge"
02:03:12;02:03:14;"We'll see everybody in a week"
02:03:14;02:03:16;"Peace"
02:03:16;02:03:18;"I turned my cheek to one kind remark"
02:03:18;02:03:20;"There was two of everything"
02:03:20;02:03:22;"But one of me"
02:03:22;02:03:24;"And when the race came tumbling down"
02:03:24;02:03:26;"I held my breath and I stood my ground"
02:03:26;02:03:28;"And I watched that ship go sailing"
02:03:28;02:03:30;"Out to sea"
02:03:30;02:03:32;"Take it back, take it back"
02:03:32;02:03:34;"Oh no, you can't save that"
02:03:34;02:03:36;"All of my friends are now dead"
02:03:36;02:03:38;"I'm gonna write a song about"
02:03:38;02:03:40;"Is that guy on drugs? Whose house is this?"
02:03:40;02:03:42;"Do you have a favorite John Prine song?"
02:03:42;02:03:44;"I think it's from the 70s"
02:03:44;02:03:46;"All of my friends are now dead"
02:03:46;02:03:48;"O-N-G"
02:03:48;02:03:50;"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
02:03:50;02:03:52;"Rocking off the stone"
02:03:52;02:03:54;"The black wind still blows"
02:03:54;02:03:56;"Sweet revenge"
02:03:58;02:04:00;"Without fail"
02:04:00;02:04:02;"I caught an owl seed on a plane"
02:04:02;02:04:04;"Drawing English teacher half insane"
02:04:04;02:04:06;"Making up jokes about"
02:04:06;02:04:08;"Bicycle spokes and red balloons"
02:04:08;02:04:10;"So I called up my little friend"
02:04:10;02:04:12;"And I said, ""Hey, you know,"
02:04:12;02:04:14;"I've got a friend who's a DJ"
02:04:14;02:04:16;"And he's got a lot of tunes"
02:04:16;02:04:18;"So I called up my local DJ"
02:04:18;02:04:20;"And he didn't have a lot to say"
02:04:20;02:04:22;"But the radio"
02:04:22;02:04:24;"Has learned all of my favorite tunes"
02:04:24;02:04:26;"Take it back, take it back"
02:04:26;02:04:28;"Oh no, you can't save that"
02:04:28;02:04:30;"All of my friends are now dead"
02:04:30;02:04:32;"O-N-G"
02:04:32;02:04:34;"Yeah, yeah, yeah"

02:04:36;02:04:38;"The black wind still blows"
02:04:38;02:04:40;"Sweet revenge"
02:04:42;02:04:44;"Without fail"
02:04:44;02:04:46;"The white meat is on the run"
02:04:46;02:04:48;"And the dark meat is far too done"
02:04:48;02:04:50;"And the milkman left me a note"
02:04:50;02:04:52;"Yesterday"
02:04:52;02:04:54;"Get out of this town by noon"
02:04:54;02:04:56;"You're coming on way too soon"
02:04:56;02:04:58;"And besides that"
02:04:58;02:05:00;"We never liked you anyway"
02:05:00;02:05:02;"So I called up my little friend"
02:05:02;02:05:04;"And I said, ""Hey, you know,"
02:05:04;02:05:06;"I've got a friend who's a DJ"
02:05:06;02:05:08;"And he didn't have a lot to say"
