00:26;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:30;00:32;"B-B-B-Beast."
00:32;00:34;"One."

01:12;01:16;"We were only made"
01:16;01:20;"Time Crisis, February 12th, 2017."
01:20;01:23;"It's Grammy Day, Jake. Did you know that?"
01:23;01:24;"I did."
01:24;01:26;"I'm about to roll to the Grammys."
01:26;01:27;"Are you? You're going?"
01:27;01:28;"Yeah, man."
01:28;01:29;"Why?"
01:29;01:30;"'Cause I'm nominated."
01:30;01:31;"You are? For what?"
01:31;01:35;"I don't think a lot of people know, but I'm nominated for Album of the Year."
01:35;01:36;"What?"
01:36;01:38;"For Time Crisis."
01:38;01:39;"Oh!"
01:39;01:40;"No, just kidding."
01:40;01:41;"Comedy album."
01:41;01:45;"I'm nominated for Album of the Year because of my work on the Beyonce album."
01:45;01:46;"That's right."
01:46;01:47;"I've learned a lot about--"
01:47;01:48;"Okay."
01:48;01:49;"It's complicated."
01:49;01:52;"In different categories, different people get nominated."
01:52;01:57;"But for Album of the Year, all featured artists and all producers are nominated"
01:57;02:01;"as a producer on the song Hold Up."
02:01;02:02;"I'm nominated."
02:02;02:03;"Okay. That was my question."
02:03;02:06;"I was like, ""Were you a featured artist or were you a--?"""
02:06;02:07;"No, it's as a producer."
02:07;02:08;"Not as a writer."
02:08;02:10;"Writers don't get nominated, but--"
02:10;02:11;"So you helped produce that song?"
02:11;02:13;"I thought you just wrote that."
02:13;02:15;"Remember last year we did that whole segment?"
02:15;02:16;"Yeah, we broke it down."
02:16;02:17;"That was cool."
02:17;02:20;"No, me and Diplo and Beyonce are the three producers on that song."
02:20;02:21;"Really?"
02:21;02:22;"Yeah."
02:22;02:23;"That's cool, man."
02:23;02:24;"We'll see."
02:24;02:26;"So are you going to sit with them?"
02:26;02:28;"See, I don't know how all that's going to go down."
02:28;02:29;"I think--"
02:29;02:31;"There's harsh hierarchies."
02:31;02:36;"Well, I heard that I will be sitting in the vicinity of Beyonce"
02:36;02:38;"because I think they try to keep the crew--"
02:38;02:40;"because we're rolling with the crew."
02:40;02:42;"We're going to go with Ariel, too."
02:42;02:43;"Okay."
02:43;02:44;"Because Ariel's also nominated for Album of the Year"
02:44;02:48;"because he worked on the Adele album."
02:48;02:49;"Oh, wow."
02:49;02:50;"So I'm going head to head."
02:50;02:51;"God, look at you guys."
02:51;02:54;"Going head to head with one of my good friends."
02:54;02:56;"I was just asking somebody, like, oh, can we all sit together?"
02:56;02:58;"And they're like, well, you've got to sit by Beyonce"
02:58;02:59;"and Ariel's got to sit by Adele."
02:59;03:00;"And I was like, really?"
03:00;03:02;"Because I don't think Beyonce and Adele care."
03:02;03:04;"Yeah."
03:04;03:07;"So if she won, you'd go up on stage with her."
03:07;03:08;"That's another question."
03:08;03:09;"I'm not aware of that."
03:09;03:12;"That's something I'm going to have to figure out there."
03:12;03:13;"Here's the thing."
03:13;03:15;"I wasn't even sure I was going to go."
03:15;03:16;"Wait, why is that?"
03:16;03:21;"Just because, you know, like most things,"
03:21;03:23;"most things are better to watch on TV."
03:23;03:25;"I was just thinking about this because of the Super Bowl."
03:25;03:26;"OK."
03:26;03:28;"Because I was talking to a dude who's"
03:28;03:30;"like a huge Boston sports fan."
03:30;03:32;"And he was really torn up about all the Trump"
03:32;03:34;"connections on the Pats."
03:34;03:35;"Right."
03:35;03:37;"And he was like, you know, I had a ticket to go."
03:37;03:38;"And this is actually before."
03:38;03:40;"We were having dinner before the Super Bowl."
03:40;03:43;"And he's like, you know, I had a ticket to go to the Super Bowl."
03:43;03:46;"But I feel like I should just watch it on TV."
03:46;03:48;"I feel like going there, it feels too weird"
03:48;03:49;"with the political situation."
03:49;03:51;"And, you know, he's trying to make a moral choice."
03:51;03:52;"Wow."
03:52;03:54;"I wonder if he regrets it now that it's like considered"
03:54;03:56;"one of the best Patriots games of all time."
03:56;03:59;"But anyway, he was saying all this to me like, yeah,"
03:59;04:00;"I don't know."
04:00;04:02;"I mean, you know, I know it'd be really fun."
04:02;04:03;"Like, I love going to see football."
04:03;04:06;"And I was like, look, morality aside,"
04:06;04:08;"isn't it just better to watch on TV?"
04:08;04:09;"Yeah."
04:09;04:10;"I went to the Super Bowl once."
04:10;04:11;"Really?"
04:11;04:15;"Yeah, when it was in New Jersey at the Metaland"
04:15;04:17;"or whatever it's called, MetLife Stadium."
04:17;04:18;"And I was just watching it."
04:18;04:19;"And I was like, we had good seats."
04:19;04:21;"And I was like, I can't tell what's going on."
04:21;04:22;"Yeah."
04:22;04:23;"Bruno Mars did the halftime show."
04:23;04:25;"I couldn't hear a damn word."
04:25;04:28;"I was like, I wish I was watching this at home"
04:28;04:32;"on the flat screen, Trey Buffalo Wings, all the bros."
04:32;04:33;"Right."
04:33;04:34;"Surround sound."
04:34;04:35;"So anyway."
04:35;04:36;"Yeah, football's weird."
04:36;04:38;"There's so many like down times and timeouts."
04:38;04:40;"And I never have any idea what's going on."
04:40;04:43;"It's hard enough to follow, let alone being a giant thing."
04:43;04:44;"I've gone to some college games."
04:44;04:45;"Really?"
04:45;04:46;"Yeah."
04:46;04:47;"What college games?"
04:47;04:48;"Like University of Alabama?"
04:48;04:49;"No."
04:49;04:50;"My friend Kyle Field."
04:50;04:53;"His dad used to be the defensive coordinator"
04:53;04:55;"for UCLA Bruins for years."
04:55;04:56;"Oh, really?"
04:56;04:57;"Yeah."
04:57;04:58;"Oh, wow."
04:58;04:59;"And that's like a serious--"
04:59;05:00;"That's how his family--"
05:00;05:01;"That's a serious organization."
05:01;05:02;"Very."
05:02;05:03;"So Kyle grew up in this heavy football house."
05:03;05:07;"So I've gone with him and his brothers to a UCLA game."
05:07;05:08;"Oh, wow."
05:08;05:10;"But I had no-- and I don't really know football."
05:10;05:11;"It's like my least favorite sport."
05:11;05:13;"And there were so many times when there would just"
05:13;05:14;"be like a weird turnout."
05:14;05:17;"I don't even-- you know, someone would like fumble the ball"
05:17;05:18;"or whatever."
05:18;05:19;"And there'd be a--"
05:19;05:20;"See, this is terrible."
05:20;05:21;"This is terrible."
05:21;05:22;"I can't--"
05:22;05:23;"You'd just be like, I don't know what's happening."
05:23;05:25;"Yeah, they were just like, well, like, here's"
05:25;05:26;"the thing with football."
05:26;05:28;"And OK, people say baseball's slow."
05:28;05:29;"But you like baseball."
05:29;05:30;"I love baseball."
05:30;05:31;"Football's slow because it takes three hours"
05:31;05:35;"to play an hour-long game, which to me is like insane."
05:35;05:38;"You might like rugby."
05:38;05:39;"I doubt it."
05:39;05:42;"I think you should start supporting the New Zealand"
05:42;05:44;"National Rugby Squad."
05:44;05:47;"It's like football, except there's no brakes."
05:47;05:49;"And the clothes are better."
05:49;05:51;"That's heavy about your friend, though."
05:51;05:52;"Oh, yeah."
05:52;05:53;"Skipping the ball."
05:53;05:55;"We're going into Russian doll storytelling."
05:55;05:56;"So he skipped it."
05:56;05:58;"At the time, I was just also being like, dude,"
05:58;05:59;"it's not a hard choice."
05:59;06:03;"It's like not only you don't have to go like shell out"
06:03;06:05;"all this money to go support an organization that maybe you're"
06:05;06:08;"having mixed feelings about because of Robert Craft"
06:08;06:10;"and the Trump and Bill Belichick."
06:10;06:12;"It's also just going to be better to watch it at home"
06:12;06:15;"with like a bunch of your Boston friends or whatever."
06:15;06:16;"Who's Robert Craft?"
06:16;06:17;"Who's that?"
06:17;06:19;"Robert Craft is the owner of the New England Patriots."
06:19;06:23;"Also an alumnus of Columbia University because I remember"
06:23;06:27;"there's a bunch of junk named after him when I was an undergrad."
06:27;06:29;"Is there a relation to the Kraft Foods Group?"
06:29;06:30;"I don't think so."
06:30;06:31;"Okay, different spelling."
06:31;06:33;"You know who owns the Falcons?"
06:33;06:34;"The losers."
06:34;06:35;"Coke?"
06:35;06:37;"No, the Home Depot dude."
06:37;06:38;"Oh, my God."
06:38;06:40;"He's also like a crazy right winger, right?"
06:40;06:41;"Is he?"
06:41;06:42;"Yeah, I think so."
06:42;06:43;"Oh, man, you can't win."
06:43;06:44;"His name's Arthur Blank."
06:44;06:45;"He was wearing like a funny suit on the field."
06:45;06:48;"But anyway, my point is like stuff is better on TV."
06:48;06:49;"Right."
06:49;06:50;"Don't play yourself."
06:50;06:55;"And the Grammys are better on TV because when you sit there,"
06:55;06:57;"even if you have good seats on the floor,"
06:57;06:59;"you know, they have all these stages."
06:59;07:01;"It's like Saturday Night Live where there's like four stages"
07:01;07:03;"because they have to switch from that to that."
07:03;07:05;"So there's no such thing as a great seat."
07:05;07:06;"You can't see the details."
07:06;07:08;"Katy Perry is over here and you're craning your neck,"
07:08;07:14;"and then on the left is Imagine Dragons featuring Kendrick Lamar."
07:14;07:16;"So wait, there's four stages?"
07:16;07:18;"There's at least like three."
07:18;07:19;"No, yeah, there's like four."
07:19;07:22;"So that means three quarters of the time you're just looking at nothing?"
07:22;07:23;"And then kind of."
07:23;07:24;"Well, you got to like turn around,"
07:24;07:27;"and then suddenly somebody's like performing behind you."
07:27;07:28;"Wow."
07:28;07:31;"Elton John and Eminem are like -- so I'm just saying."
07:31;07:35;"My initial gut impulse was like I'd happily watch the Grammys at home,"
07:35;07:39;"play to Buffalo Wings, all my Boston guys surrounding me as always."
07:39;07:41;"And so I was like I'm probably not going to go."
07:41;07:42;"Boston strong."
07:42;07:49;"I'm just -- all my Boston boys just enjoying some wangs."
07:49;07:51;"So I was like I don't need to go."
07:51;07:55;"And also like obviously I'm proud of my work on the Beyonce album,"
07:55;07:58;"but it is like a tangential nomination."
07:58;08:01;"You know, it's like it's her album obviously."
08:01;08:05;"Would you actually get one of those little horn statues?"
08:05;08:06;"It's called a Grammy."
08:06;08:07;"Oh, oh."
08:07;08:09;"[laughter]"
08:09;08:11;"Oh, it's a gramophone, okay."
08:11;08:12;"Yeah, yeah."
08:12;08:13;"No, I would get one."
08:13;08:16;"You know, a horn statue."
08:16;08:18;"And the golden --"
08:18;08:21;"Wrap it in bubble wrap, put it in the back of the closet."
08:21;08:25;"The golden horn statue for album of the year goes to"
08:25;08:27;"Steely Dan for Two Against Nature."
09:59;10:01;"But anyways, I was thinking I wasn't going to go,"
10:01;10:04;"and then like Ariel was going to go,"
10:04;10:06;"and then I was like all right, maybe it'll be kind of fun."
10:06;10:08;"It'll be exciting to be."
10:08;10:12;"I haven't been since -- I haven't been in a few years."
10:12;10:14;"But then as far as this getting up on stage thing,"
10:14;10:18;"I do legitimately have some anxiety about that because historically"
10:18;10:22;"when somebody wins album of the year, the whole gang does often --"
10:22;10:23;"well, I don't know."
10:23;10:25;"Maybe I should be doing some research."
10:25;10:27;"Often the whole gang goes on stage."
10:27;10:31;"I have a picture when Taylor Swift won album of the year a couple years ago."
10:31;10:32;"Clearly."
10:32;10:37;"Because you see that picture comes up a lot because of this unending drama"
10:37;10:39;"between her and Kanye and the Kardashians."
10:39;10:41;"So there's always a picture of her giving her speech,"
10:41;10:46;"and you can see she's like flanked by all the producers."
10:46;10:48;"Seinfeld 2000 just pulled up the image."
10:48;10:50;"It says album of the year behind her."
10:50;10:52;"She's holding the horn statue."
10:52;10:57;"She's wearing a magenta and orange dress,"
10:57;11:03;"and behind her are eight or nine men in tuxedos."
11:03;11:07;"Is one guy wearing a leather jacket?"
11:07;11:11;"Oh, Macklemore is standing on stage because he must have given it to her."
11:11;11:13;"Or maybe he has a feature on that album that I forgot."
11:13;11:15;"Or maybe that's not Macklemore."
11:15;11:17;"But is it your call whether to go on stage,"
11:17;11:21;"or is there going to be like some dude with a wireless headset that's just like--"
11:21;11:23;"See, I don't know."
11:23;11:24;"That sounds stressful."
11:24;11:25;"Well, because here's my feeling."
11:25;11:27;"I don't feel one way or another about it."
11:27;11:31;"If she wins, I think it should be her call."
11:31;11:34;"Does she want to go--maybe she wants to say something"
11:34;11:39;"and doesn't want to be surrounded by 25 knuckleheads."
11:39;11:43;"But at the same time, if everybody else went on stage"
11:43;11:46;"and I was like too nervous or something, I don't want to like hang back"
11:46;11:48;"or imagine like a really bad scenario."
11:48;11:50;"Then what if everybody did go on stage,"
11:50;11:52;"and then I'm like, ""Oh, wait."
11:52;11:53;"So we're going on stage?"""
11:53;11:55;"And they're like, ""Yeah, yeah, you should go."""
11:55;11:57;"And then I'm like the last idiot on stage."
11:57;11:58;"They already started talking."
11:58;12:00;"That would be even worse."
12:00;12:05;"So anyway, I just--I think it should be the artist's prerogative."
12:05;12:06;"But you see it in other years."
12:06;12:08;"You see everybody just jumps up, and they're running."
12:08;12:10;"I don't know."
12:10;12:12;"Stressful, man."
12:12;12:15;"It sounds like dodgeball or something."
12:15;12:16;"Yeah."
12:16;12:19;"You're just like jockeying for the right position."
12:19;12:21;"Yeah, when the pinata breaks open."
12:21;12:23;"So it's her, it's Adele."
12:23;12:25;"Sturgill Simpson is also nominated for album of the year."
12:25;12:26;"21 Pilots?"
12:26;12:28;"They did not get a nom for album of the year."
12:28;12:30;"Chainsmokes?"
12:30;12:32;"Chainsmokers have never released an album."
12:32;12:34;"Oh, okay."
12:34;12:37;"Sheermag?"
12:37;12:39;"No, it's Bieber."
12:39;12:40;"Oh."
12:40;12:42;"Another Time Crisis favorite is nominated."
12:42;12:45;"The favorites are Beyonce and Adele."
12:45;12:51;"But then sometimes it happens that the two frontrunners rob votes from one another,"
12:51;12:53;"and then you get the surprise victory."
12:53;12:54;"Sturgill."
12:54;12:56;"Maybe you get a Sturgill."
12:56;12:59;"That's how people felt when Beck won."
12:59;13:01;"Oh, yeah."
13:01;13:02;"I don't know."
13:02;13:03;"I also got to figure out what to wear."
13:03;13:05;"Straight up tux?"
13:05;13:07;"No, definitely not a tux."
13:07;13:12;"The first time Vampire Weekend was nominated, and we'd never been before,"
13:12;13:14;"felt like, oh, we should dress up a little bit."
13:14;13:18;"I was wearing kind of like a fancy blazer."
13:18;13:20;"What album was this for?"
13:20;13:23;"Contra was nominated for best alternative album."
13:23;13:26;"We lost to the Black Keys."
13:26;13:30;"We went and was kind of dressed up, and I was like, this is--"
13:30;13:33;"I was like, if I ever come back here, I'm going to be way more casual."
13:33;13:37;"And then the next time we came back, I just wore a sweater,"
13:37;13:40;"and then we actually won, and I felt way more comfortable."
13:40;13:41;"And I'm like, I'm glad."
13:41;13:42;"Yeah."
13:42;13:47;"At the Grammys, you do have everything from people wearing tuxedos to T-shirts."
13:47;13:50;"Yeah, like Kid Rock's wearing like a Bob Seger tee."
13:50;13:51;"You can wear whatever you want."
13:51;13:52;"Yeah, I mean, you're an artist."
13:52;13:54;"You should wear whatever you want, right?"

28:04;28:04;"You know what?"
28:04;28:07;"From the same era, or maybe more '90s,"
28:07;28:08;"it's a little fancier."
28:08;28:10;"But a very rare treat that would really"
28:10;28:12;"brighten up a dark New England winter morning"
28:12;28:16;"is a nice and toasty Sara Lee croissant"

28:17;28:19;"You ever have those?"
28:19;28:19;"No."
28:19;28:21;"You know, Sara Lee would make frozen--"

28:22;28:24;"Frozen?"
28:24;28:25;"What was the point of frozen orange juice?"
28:25;28:28;"Is it cheaper than just buying it fresh?"
28:28;28:30;"Fresh was like not a thing on the market"
28:30;28:32;"commonly in the '80s, man."
28:32;28:34;"You couldn't go to the supermarket"
28:34;28:34;"and just get like a--"
28:34;28:35;"Like a Tropicana?"
28:35;28:36;"Really?"
28:36;28:37;"No, that started in the--"
28:37;28:38;"I remember that specifically."
28:38;28:39;"Oh my-- really?"
28:39;28:42;"In the '90s, it was like all of a sudden there was like,"
28:42;28:44;"oh, wait, you can just buy like a half gallon"
28:44;28:49;"carton of Tropicana orange juice for like $3.50 or whatever."
28:49;28:52;"And it's way better."
28:52;28:54;"I remember asking my mom like, why didn't we"
28:54;28:58;"like drink this much better orange juice back in the '80s?"
28:58;28:59;"She's like, we couldn't."
28:59;28:59;"Yeah, wasn't around."
28:59;29:02;"Under Reagan, no such thing."
29:02;29:04;"One thing I've always wondered about orange juice"
29:04;29:07;"is, why does it taste so much worse than an orange?"
29:07;29:10;"Even the best not from concentrate orange juice"
29:10;29:13;"does not have that clear, gorgeous taste of when you're"
29:13;29:14;"just like eating fresh orange."
29:14;29:15;"Well, it makes sense."
29:15;29:17;"I mean, you're one degree removed."
29:17;29:19;"You know, orange juice is messed up, though."
29:19;29:21;"It's like drinking like--"
29:21;29:23;"when we talk about diet stuff, that's"
29:23;29:25;"just like drinking a soda that has like vitamins in it."
29:25;29:26;"Yeah, you can--"
29:26;29:28;"It's just like sugar."

29:33;29:35;"All right, well, let's talk to Mr. Berkowitz"
29:35;29:36;"from the Bagel Nook."
29:36;29:39;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
29:39;29:41;"[PHONE RINGING]"
29:41;29:46;"Hello, how you doing?"
29:46;29:47;"Hey, what's up, David?"
29:47;29:49;"You're on with Ezra and Jake from Time Crisis."
29:49;29:51;"We understand you also have your wife, Stacey, with you."
29:51;29:52;"That's right."
29:52;29:53;"Hello."
29:53;29:54;"Hey, guys."
29:54;29:57;"So you guys are the owner operators of the Bagel Nook"
29:57;29:58;"in Freehold, New Jersey."
29:58;30:02;"Along with my son, Alex, and my daughter, Jessica,"
30:02;30:04;"does all our Instagram and social media."
30:04;30:06;"Oh, so it's a whole family business."
30:06;30:07;"So it's a family business, yes."
30:07;30:09;"So how long has the Bagel Nook been open?"
30:09;30:13;"We're open about 17 months now."
30:13;30:17;"This is a new venture, and we came out with a home run."
30:17;30:19;"Obviously, we want to talk about the Flamin' Hot Cheetos"
30:19;30:21;"bagel, because we talk about Flamin' Hot Cheetos"
30:21;30:22;"a lot on this show."
30:22;30:25;"But what initially put the Bagel Nook on the map?"
30:25;30:27;"When we first opened up, me and Alex, my son,"
30:27;30:29;"we said, we've got to come out with something with a bang."
30:29;30:32;"So I said, let's do an Oreo cream cheese."
30:32;30:34;"And then he said, let's do an Oreo bagel."
30:34;30:38;"And then we're selling the Oreo cream cheese on the Oreo bagel."
30:38;30:40;"And then one day, Alex said to somebody, hey,"
30:40;30:43;"you want Oreos in the middle of that?"
30:43;30:45;"And we called it an Oreo overload."
30:45;30:50;"So once we did that, then it was picked up by BuzzFeed."
30:50;30:52;"And after it was picked up by BuzzFeed,"
30:52;30:54;"it was picked up by the Today Show and Live with Kelly."
30:54;30:56;"And it went viral."
30:56;30:59;"And that was only about six or eight months ago."
30:59;31:02;"And since then, we're always coming out"
31:02;31:05;"with different types of bagels and different types of cream"
31:05;31:06;"cheeses."
31:06;31:08;"And we're always pushing the limits"
31:08;31:12;"to try and do different things and wacky, crazy stuff."
31:12;31:14;"Wow, so I got to ask, since you guys are a new operation,"
31:14;31:17;"you're coming out doing Oreo overload, Flamin' Hot Cheetos"
31:17;31:18;"bagels, Captain Crunch bagels."
31:18;31:19;"You're all over the place."
31:19;31:22;"What was the bagel scene in the Freehold region"
31:22;31:24;"like before Bagel Nook opened?"
31:24;31:27;"There's no bagel store that does what we do."
31:27;31:31;"We have 30 different wild flavors of cream cheeses."
31:31;31:33;"They try and copy us, but they just"
31:33;31:37;"don't keep up with it because it's very labor intensive."
31:37;31:39;"And they don't know the ingredients and the time"
31:39;31:41;"and labor that goes into it."
31:41;31:43;"And we're the only game in town that"
31:43;31:46;"does all these crazy things."
31:46;31:51;"We get people from Baltimore, Massachusetts, Manhattan,"
31:51;31:53;"Philadelphia, all over the place."
31:53;31:56;"People travel every single weekend."
31:56;31:58;"And it's a mob scene in the store."
31:58;31:59;"It's great."
31:59;32:01;"So I got to ask, because you're from Freehold,"
32:01;32:03;"have you had a Bruce Springsteen visit yet?"
32:03;32:07;"We did not have a Bruce Springsteen visit yet,"
32:07;32:08;"and I just can't wait."
32:08;32:10;"I know it's going to happen."
32:10;32:15;"I just, two hours ago, finished his book."
32:15;32:16;"And it's the best, best book."
32:16;32:17;"Growing Up New Jersey."
32:17;32:19;"Oh, it's a great book, yeah."
32:19;32:20;"Huge, huge Springsteen fan."
32:20;32:23;"I'm just waiting for him to come in."
32:23;32:26;"We have a poster on the wall from 1971"
32:26;32:29;"of the original members of the band."
32:29;32:31;"And it's just, you know, I'm just waiting."
32:31;32:32;"If I see Bruce at the Grammys, that's"
32:32;32:34;"the one thing I'm going to say to him."
32:34;32:35;"Tell him to come to the Nook, man."
32:35;32:36;"Get your ass down to the Nook."
32:36;32:38;"Get your ass to the Nook."
32:38;32:39;"All right, so obviously you guys have"
32:39;32:42;"the kind of wacky stuff on lock."
32:42;32:47;"Can I come through and just get a sesame bagel with a schmear?"
32:47;32:48;"Absolutely."
32:48;32:49;"We're a full bagel deli."
32:49;32:54;"We do pancakes, stuffed French toast, regular French toast,"
32:54;32:57;"pork roll egg and cheese, bacon egg and cheeses,"
32:57;32:59;"salad, the full line of Borscht."
32:59;33:00;"Oh, wow."
33:00;33:03;"Yeah, we're soup, salad, sandwiches."
33:03;33:04;"We're everything."
33:04;33:07;"We're just known for all the wacky stuff, all the stuff."
33:07;33:09;"OK, so speaking of the wacky stuff,"
33:09;33:11;"we just tried the Flamin' Hot Cheetos bagels."
33:11;33:14;"Does this actually contain the Frito-Lay's product,"
33:14;33:15;"Flamin' Hot Cheetos?"
33:15;33:16;"Yes, it does."
33:16;33:18;"OK, so can you walk us through the process?"
33:18;33:20;"Obviously, you don't want to give up any trade secrets,"
33:20;33:22;"but how do you make these?"
33:22;33:25;"It's really a red and orange bagel"
33:25;33:29;"that's hand twisted with the Flamin' Hot Cheetos in it."
33:29;33:30;"They're in the dough."
33:30;33:33;"They're in the dough, and they're on the outside."
33:33;33:36;"But what happened before the Flamin' Hot Cheeto,"
33:36;33:39;"to get to that, I think about a month ago, two months ago,"
33:39;33:43;"I wanted to do a ghost chili pepper cream cheese."
33:43;33:45;"That's like an incredibly hot pepper."
33:45;33:47;"The hottest chili out there."
33:47;33:51;"So I couldn't find it to buy, because nobody carries it."
33:51;33:53;"But I just had it in my mind, I want to do a ghost"
33:53;33:56;"pepper chili cream cheese."
33:56;33:59;"So there's one food market that's close by."
33:59;34:00;"They have it."
34:00;34:02;"It's in dried form."
34:02;34:04;"And I'm like, holy mackerel, I'm going to buy this."
34:04;34:06;"I'm going to finally try and make it."
34:06;34:07;"So I buy it."
34:07;34:08;"We make it."
34:08;34:13;"It's super, super, super spicy, but it's delicious."
34:13;34:16;"So I said to Alex, I said, we've got to come up with something"
34:16;34:17;"that goes with this."
34:17;34:19;"We do a Dorito bagel."
34:19;34:21;"Oh, wait, wait, sorry, just real quick, with the Dorito bagel,"
34:21;34:23;"are we talking Cool Ranch--"
34:23;34:23;"Nacho cheese."
34:23;34:24;"--nacho cheese?"
34:24;34:28;"The Dorito bagel is the straight up nacho cheese Dorito bagel,"
34:28;34:29;"which really is delicious."
34:29;34:30;"Straight up."
34:30;34:31;"Straight up."
34:31;34:34;"And then after that, not too far after that, we said,"
34:34;34:36;"let's do the Flamin' Hot Cheeto."
34:36;34:38;"So we did the Flamin' Hot Cheeto,"
34:38;34:40;"paired it with the ghost pepper cream cheese."
34:40;34:41;"Ah."
34:41;34:43;"Oh, it's so good, I can't tell you."
34:43;34:47;"But also, for those that don't want to go hot, hot,"
34:47;34:50;"we made a Cool Ranch cream cheese to go with it."
34:50;34:51;"Oh."
34:51;34:51;"I know."
34:51;34:53;"There's such a variety."
34:53;34:53;"That's wild."
34:53;34:54;"Great, yeah."
34:54;34:57;"So I'm just curious, were you in the food services industry"
34:57;34:59;"before the family started this business?"
34:59;35:00;"I was not."
35:00;35:04;"My son, actually, Alex went to two years of Johnson and Wales."
35:04;35:07;"Before high school, he worked in a bunch of bagel stores."
35:07;35:10;"He went to Johnson and Wales in Rhode Island."
35:10;35:13;"He partied a little bit too much."
35:13;35:14;"Oh."
35:14;35:14;"Yep."
35:14;35:16;"Neglected the grades."
35:16;35:19;"He was asked to leave and bring up the grades,"
35:19;35:21;"and he'll be allowed back."
35:21;35:23;"So my wife and I said, you know what?"
35:23;35:26;"We're not going to waste the money because you're"
35:26;35:27;"partying too much."
35:27;35:30;"Go to a community college, and we'll look for a business"
35:30;35:33;"because Alex is so passionate."
35:33;35:37;"And this was his dream from when he was like 16 years old."
35:37;35:39;"And we knew he wanted to do it, and we took a long time"
35:39;35:41;"to find a bagel store."
35:41;35:43;"And we just said, you're not going to go back to school."
35:43;35:45;"We'll just put the money into a business."
35:45;35:49;"And we finally found something, and we took it over,"
35:49;35:51;"and the rest is history."
35:51;35:55;"So if you could estimate, how many Flamin' Hot Cheetos"
35:55;35:57;"are in a bagel that you would make?"
35:57;35:57;"Good question."
35:57;36:01;"Do you have to buy, like, bags and bags and bags of Flamin'"
36:01;36:02;"Hot every week?"
36:02;36:03;"You're not saying enough."
36:03;36:07;"It's bags and bags and bags and bags and bags and bags"
36:07;36:08;"and then more bags."
36:08;36:09;"What are we talking here in terms of volume?"
36:09;36:14;"We're talking probably like 30 bags a weekend."
36:14;36:15;"Is it your best seller?"
36:15;36:16;"What's your best seller?"
36:16;36:17;"Oreos are best seller."
36:17;36:20;"And what we decided to do is take the Oreo bagel"
36:20;36:24;"with Oreo cream cheese and Oreos inside,"
36:24;36:26;"and Alex decided to deep fry it."
36:26;36:29;"So he puts it in some type of batter"
36:29;36:32;"and throws the whole thing into the fryer."
36:32;36:37;"And it comes out with this warm, crusty crunch on the outside."
36:37;36:40;"And inside, the cream cheese starts to ooze."
36:40;36:43;"And everybody loves that."
36:43;36:43;"Oh, wow."
36:43;36:45;"This is fully a dessert item."
36:45;36:46;"Is that a breakfast item?"
36:46;36:48;"People do it for breakfast all the time."
36:48;36:49;"Oh, no."
36:49;36:49;"Woo!"
36:49;36:52;"So are you guys ever at the shop--"
36:52;36:53;"what time do you guys open?"
36:53;36:55;"6 o'clock to 3 o'clock, seven days a week."
36:55;36:56;"Oh, wow."
36:56;36:58;"Yeah, I guess a bagel place has to open early."
36:58;37:00;"So you're ever there, it's like 6.15,"
37:00;37:02;"a construction worker comes in, says,"
37:02;37:04;"let me get the deep fried--"
37:04;37:05;"what's it called, Oreo--"
37:05;37:06;"Overload."
37:06;37:08;"Let me get a deep fried Oreo Overload"
37:08;37:09;"and a cup of black coffee."
37:09;37:11;"And you're just like, wow."
37:11;37:13;"It's not as sweet as people think."
37:13;37:15;"It's just delicious."
37:15;37:17;"People get such great reactions from it."
37:17;37:21;"They're so surprised that it's not as sweet as you think it is."
37:21;37:22;"Because of the cream cheese, right?"
37:22;37:23;"Is that why?"
37:23;37:25;"The cream cheese, yeah."
37:25;37:27;"Oh, I know why, sure."
37:27;37:28;"I just can't tell you why."
37:28;37:30;"Oh."
37:30;37:32;"It sounds like you need a nap afterwards."
37:32;37:33;"You do."
37:33;37:34;"I grew up in New Jersey."
37:34;37:36;"I'm a little further north than you guys."
37:36;37:39;"Being from the East Coast, I love a good bagel."
37:39;37:40;"But I also do--"
37:40;37:42;"I have to admit, one of my guilty pleasures,"
37:42;37:44;"I also like to go to Dunkin' Donuts sometimes"
37:44;37:45;"and get an egg and cheese there."
37:45;37:48;"As a small business owner, what's your take on Dunkin'?"
37:48;37:50;"What's my take on Dunkin'?"
37:50;37:51;"We have a delicious--"
37:51;37:53;"we have a full coffee bar."
37:53;37:56;"So first of all, I'm a Starbucks kind of guy."
37:56;37:57;"My wife is a Starbucks girl."
37:57;38:00;"And they're all both in the same shopping center as us."
38:00;38:03;"Yeah, there's really zero comparison."
38:03;38:05;"Because our bacon, egg, and cheese"
38:05;38:08;"and our pork roll egg and cheese, they're all made fresh."
38:08;38:10;"They're not put in the microwave or anything."
38:10;38:12;"But so how does that make you feel"
38:12;38:15;"if you see a consumer comes in holding a venti from Starbucks"
38:15;38:17;"and ordering a bagel from you?"
38:17;38:18;"Do you ever just want to say to them, come on,"
38:18;38:19;"our coffee's good too."
38:19;38:21;"Just we're a one stop."
38:21;38:22;"No, not at all."
38:22;38:24;"Everything's all good."
38:24;38:26;"No, if people want to bring in Starbucks, bring in Starbucks."
38:26;38:30;"Sometimes I drink my caramel macchiato in the store."
38:30;38:31;"So it's all good."
38:31;38:32;"Oh, really?"
38:32;38:32;"Yeah."
38:32;38:33;"It's all good."
38:33;38:35;"I like that you guys are mellow."
38:35;38:36;"We're totally mellow."
38:36;38:39;"And the people of Freehold are so, so nice."
38:39;38:40;"Where'd you grow up?"
38:40;38:41;"I grew up in Glen Ridge."
38:41;38:43;"It's up kind of closer to Newark."
38:43;38:45;"Yeah, that's by Tenafly, right?"
38:45;38:47;"Yeah, not too far from Tenafly, one county over."
38:47;38:50;"Yeah, you're only about 40 minutes from us."
38:50;38:50;"No, yeah."
38:50;38:52;"Next time I'm over at my parents' house,"
38:52;38:54;"I'd love to take them down and check out the Nook."
38:54;38:55;"Do you guys do merchandise?"
38:55;38:57;"We have t-shirts."
38:57;38:58;"And we ship nationwide."
38:58;39:01;"If you go to the website, there's"
39:01;39:03;"a link for clicking, and it's Goldbelly."
39:03;39:05;"And we ship nationwide, too."
39:05;39:07;"Oh, you know, one last question."
39:07;39:08;"And Jake, I'm curious."
39:08;39:09;"This was a nationwide thing."
39:09;39:12;"I remember growing up in northern New Jersey, where"
39:12;39:14;"you got a lot of bagel shops, and you"
39:14;39:16;"got a lot of Irish people."
39:16;39:20;"Since I was a little kid, every single St. Paddy's Day,"
39:20;39:22;"we would eat green bagels in school."
39:22;39:23;"You have green bagels in Connecticut?"
39:23;39:24;"Oh, yeah."
39:24;39:27;"So you guys must do green bagels on St. Patrick's Day, right?"
39:27;39:29;"We absolutely do green bagels."
39:29;39:33;"And this year, we're going to be shipping them nationwide."
39:33;39:35;"And I'm going to come out with a cream cheese."
39:35;39:37;"I can't say it right now, because I"
39:37;39:38;"don't want to put it out there."
39:38;39:39;"But when I make it, if you want,"
39:39;39:41;"I'll get back in touch with you."
39:41;39:43;"And I'll give you a first dip at what it is."
39:43;39:46;"But I have, like, two cream cheeses"
39:46;39:48;"that are going to blow you away."
39:48;39:49;"OK, I can't wait."
39:49;39:51;"Maybe closer to St. Paddy's Day, you could call in again."
39:51;39:53;"I absolutely will."
39:53;39:54;"Where are you shipping to?"
39:54;39:57;"We ship to Arizona, Florida--"
39:57;39:58;"Hawaii."
39:58;39:59;"Hawaii a couple times."
39:59;40:00;"Oh, wow."
40:00;40:02;"All over, all over."
40:02;40:03;"That's incredible."
40:03;40:05;"It's crazy."
40:05;40:08;"We're just riding this and enjoying the moment."
40:08;40:09;"I mean, we're talking to you guys."
40:09;40:11;"The media is just getting in touch with us."
40:11;40:16;"It's just a fantastic, great thing for my son, my daughter,"
40:16;40:17;"even for us."
40:17;40:18;"Yeah, I mean, it's a great story."
40:18;40:19;"That sounds amazing."
40:19;40:20;"The whole family can get together,"
40:20;40:21;"do something like that."
40:21;40:24;"Well, thanks so much, David and Stacey."
40:24;40:25;"Send our regards to the kids."
40:25;40:28;"And congratulations on the success of the Bagel Nook."
40:28;40:29;"We'll definitely be in touch again."
40:29;40:30;"OK, thanks."
40:30;40:33;"And when you're in town, please come in,"
40:33;40:34;"have breakfast and lunch on us."
40:34;40:35;"Oh, amazing."
40:35;40:36;"I'm coming through."
40:36;40:37;"All right, have a good one, guys."
40:37;40:37;"Got it."
40:37;40:38;"Thank you so much."
40:38;40:39;"All right, bye."

45:24;45:26;"Like, some people always dream about opening a bar."

45:28;45:29;"And now I'm thinking like Bagel Place."

45:31;45:32;"Yeah, and I wouldn't mind that much."
45:32;45:34;"I mean, I think that's a really beautiful thing."

45:57;45:57;"Oh, really?"
45:57;45:59;"--in a strip mall near my house."
45:59;46:01;"It was called Kim's Coffee."
46:01;46:03;"It was named after their daughter, Kim."
46:03;46:07;"And so she would reluctantly do shifts there when she was 17."
46:07;46:08;"And would you go?"
46:08;46:08;"Yeah."
46:08;46:10;"I'd go down there with my dad on a Sunday morning."
46:10;46:12;"So this is like a '90s mom and pop Connecticut."
46:12;46:13;"Yeah."
46:13;46:14;"So what was the vibe?"
46:14;46:15;"Is it like fluorescent lighting?"
46:15;46:16;"Yeah."
46:16;46:17;"Was it cozy?"
46:17;46:18;"No."
46:18;46:20;"Yeah, it lasted three or four years."
46:20;46:23;"It was not a smash hit."
46:23;46:27;"And maybe part of that was the ambiance or lack thereof."
46:27;46:29;"But I do remember going down there one Sunday morning,"
46:29;46:34;"like early, with my dad at like 715 or something."
46:34;46:36;"And hanging out in the back where"
46:36;46:37;"they were making the donuts."
46:37;46:39;"And I'd never seen donuts or even thought"
46:39;46:41;"about how donuts were made."
46:41;46:41;"Oh, yeah."
46:41;46:44;"And there was just this giant vat of grease."
46:44;46:47;"And then he was just peeling off--"
46:47;46:49;"so he had the donut batter."
46:49;46:51;"He was forcing it through this chute."
46:51;46:56;"And he would drop these basically round batter balls"
46:56;46:57;"into this--"
46:57;46:58;"The boiling--"
46:58;46:59;"--boiling grease."
46:59;47:01;"Was it unappetizing?"
47:01;47:02;"A little bit."
47:02;47:03;"Great donuts, though."
47:03;47:06;"Should we look at some of these listener questions?"
47:06;47:06;"Oh, yeah."
47:06;47:10;"So first, let's get Seinfeld 2000 on the mic for a second."

47:10;47:11;"Hey, what's up?"
47:11;47:15;"Well, first of all, I wanted to congratulate you."
47:15;47:18;"I think you got those Time Crisis Twitter account numbers"
47:18;47:19;"up."
47:19;47:20;"I want to check right now."
47:20;47:21;"We're fully viral."
47:21;47:26;"So I think last week, we were at like around 2,500?"
47:26;47:29;"Yeah, about 2.5K."
47:29;47:34;"For a variety of reasons, I haven't been on Twitter"
47:34;47:35;"all that much lately."
47:35;47:38;"I'm trying to make this album."
47:38;47:40;"I'm trying to take in what's happening,"
47:40;47:42;"the awful events of the world around me,"
47:42;47:46;"in a measured, sane way where I can process it."
47:46;47:47;"So I haven't been on Twitter all that much."
47:47;47:49;"So I haven't seen all of your tweets, which I love."
47:49;47:51;"I love that you're just doing your thing over there."
47:51;47:51;"Wow."
47:51;47:52;"OK."
47:52;47:54;"You crossed the 5,000 threshold."
47:54;47:54;"Congratulations."
47:54;47:55;"Thank you."
47:55;47:56;"Yeah, I'm just crushing it."
47:56;47:58;"You are a hell of a social media manager."
47:58;47:59;"Well, thank you very much."
47:59;48:00;"I also want to tell you guys--"
48:00;48:02;"this is going to be a bad story, because I"
48:02;48:03;"don't want to say where."
48:03;48:04;"But the other day, I was having lunch,"
48:04;48:08;"and Kelsey Grammer was in the restaurant."
48:08;48:10;"Why don't you want to say where?"
48:10;48:11;"I don't want people to know where I go to."
48:11;48:14;"Was it Cafe Nervosa?"
48:14;48:15;"Cafe 101?"
48:15;48:16;"I'll say it was in Los Angeles."
48:16;48:17;"What was Kelsey's vibe?"
48:17;48:18;"And I don't want to put him on blast."
48:18;48:21;"I don't want people to know where Kelsey goes to."
48:21;48:24;"So when Kelsey goes into a restaurant like that,"
48:24;48:27;"do you think the waiter has to restrain herself"
48:27;48:31;"not to ask if he's going to get the tossed salad?"
48:31;48:33;"Because that's all I would be thinking."
48:33;48:35;"If Kelsey ever came to my diner--"
48:35;48:36;"Ezra's Place."
48:36;48:39;"Whatever-- if he came to Ezra's Place, whatever he ordered,"
48:39;48:43;"he'd be like, well, Niles, I'll have the Denver omelet"
48:43;48:45;"and a side of bacon."
48:45;48:46;"The waiter comes back, and I'm like,"
48:46;48:48;"we're bringing this full tossed salad and scrambled eggs."
48:48;48:49;"I don't give a--"
48:49;48:51;"[LAUGHTER]"
48:51;48:53;"Anyway, it was nice that after we"
48:53;48:54;"talked so much about Frazier last time"
48:54;48:56;"that I got to at least briefly bask"
48:56;48:59;"in the glow of the man himself."
48:59;49:00;"That's cosmic."
49:00;49:03;"OK, so @signful2000, you requested"
49:03;49:04;"people to ask some questions."
49:04;49:07;"Yeah, I said something like, everybody"
49:07;49:11;"respond to this tweet with questions for Ezra and Jake."
49:11;49:12;"And you know what?"
49:12;49:13;"People didn't disappoint."
49:13;49:16;"OK, so these are-- you picked out your favorites"
49:16;49:17;"that I have printed out here?"
49:17;49:17;"Yeah."
49:17;49:19;"OK, so I'm going to start."
49:19;49:24;"Jake, from @motherjossmisty, wow, I hope--"
49:24;49:26;"you know, I've seen some of these names before."
49:26;49:27;"Forgive me if I'm not saying it correctly."
49:27;49:29;"You never really know how to say somebody's Twitter handle."
49:29;49:30;"Yeah."
49:30;49:32;"Because you'd normally just type it."
49:32;49:34;"If you had to eat one flavor of chips for the rest of your life,"
49:34;49:35;"what would it be?"
49:35;49:38;"That is a tough one."
49:38;49:40;"Like a pita chip?"
49:40;49:41;"Something really chill."
49:41;49:42;"Oh, wow, something boring."
49:42;49:43;"Yeah."
49:43;49:44;"All right, fair enough."
49:44;49:48;"OK, Ezra, this is from @bennybiju."
49:48;49:51;"Hey, guys, I'm a huge ABBA fan, and I've"
49:51;49:52;"always wondered why you chose One of Us"
49:52;49:55;"as the opener for the show."
49:55;49:56;"Oh, great question."
49:56;49:58;"I always loved that song."
49:58;49:59;"And I always--"
49:59;50:01;"I don't know, I just knew it had a good intro."
50:01;50:04;"Every time I would hear that cinematic intro,"
50:04;50:07;"I would just picture a radio host speaking over it."
50:07;50:09;"So I don't know, I just kind of felt"
50:09;50:12;"like that'd be good to talk over, and then just like,"
50:12;50:14;"bom, bom, bom, bom."
50:14;50:20;"Jake, @bandsandplants, which had better music, 1970s or 1980s?"
50:20;50:21;"'70s."
50:21;50:22;"Wow, I didn't even have to think."
50:22;50:24;"No, that's obvious."
50:24;50:29;"@tondog is wondering, Ezra, will you team up"
50:29;50:33;"with the Chainsmokers on LP4?"
50:33;50:33;"Wow, all right."
50:33;50:34;"Or would you?"
50:34;50:35;"How about that?"
50:35;50:35;"Or would I?"
50:35;50:36;"Well, I don't know."
50:36;50:37;"They asked, will you?"
50:37;50:39;"I'm going to amend it slightly and say,"
50:39;50:42;"if they reached out to you, would you?"
50:42;50:44;"I would definitely sit down and break bread with those guys."
50:44;50:46;"I respect what they do."
50:46;50:48;"I'm always interested in picking somebody's brain"
50:48;50:50;"and getting to know somebody, even if they're"
50:50;50:51;"from a different genre."
50:51;50:54;"I will say to the fans who are listening,"
50:54;50:57;"after having written, I think, the vast majority of the songs"
50:57;51:04;"for LP4 so far, very few of them are in a Chainsmokers vein."
51:04;51:07;"Which either means that that's what the album's missing,"
51:07;51:09;"or that they could bring some of that over here."
51:09;51:13;"Maybe LP5 is the one to team up with the Chainsmokers on."
51:13;51:14;"Doesn't quite feel right."
51:14;51:15;"I like that."
51:15;51:16;"Jake."
51:16;51:16;"Yeah."

51:24;51:27;"what country would you live in?"
51:27;51:28;"Jeez."
51:28;51:29;"You're such an all-American guy."
51:29;51:32;"That's a tough one."

51:42;51:43;"London."
51:43;51:46;"Yeah, speak in English."
51:46;51:49;"I wasn't even thinking that."
51:49;51:50;"No, but I mean, that's a good--"
51:50;51:53;"From my line of work, what I-- yeah, I don't know."
51:53;51:54;"I've always liked London."
51:54;51:55;"You gave a pragmatic answer."
51:55;51:56;"I haven't been there in a long time."
51:56;51:59;"I've always had an affinity for it."
51:59;52:00;"Yeah."
52:00;52:04;"Jake McKay asks, if you could make any product flaming hot,"
52:04;52:06;"what would it be and why?"
52:06;52:09;"Doesn't have to be food."
52:09;52:10;"Oh, any product."
52:10;52:11;"Like a shower curtain?"
52:11;52:12;"A car?"
52:12;52:13;"Yeah."
52:13;52:14;"Oh, you know what?"
52:14;52:17;"You know how a lot of people have the fancy hand"
52:17;52:19;"soap now that's all grainy?"
52:19;52:20;"Oh, this is tight."
52:20;52:20;"Yeah."
52:20;52:24;"And I would make flaming hot."
52:24;52:27;"And it would rub your skin raw a little bit"
52:27;52:29;"and leave your fingers tingling."
52:29;52:30;"You know that lava soap?"
52:30;52:32;"Yeah, lava was the OG."
52:32;52:34;"My dad had that in the basement bathroom."
52:34;52:35;"He was like, come home from work."
52:35;52:38;"But now there's the Aesop fancy ones."
52:38;52:40;"Or if you get a nice restaurant, they have the grainy one."
52:40;52:42;"So I'd do a flaming hot hand soap."
52:42;52:47;"Ezra, @MotherJawMisty asks, Ezra,"
52:47;52:50;"have you seen that photo of you at the SAG Awards looking lost?"
52:50;52:52;"It's very funny."
52:52;52:53;"Yes, I've seen that picture."
52:53;52:54;"What is that?"
52:54;52:55;"Screen Actors Guild?"
52:55;52:56;"What is that?"
52:56;52:58;"It's the Screen Actors Guild Award."
52:58;53:00;"Oh, OK."
53:00;53:02;"I went to the SAG Awards as a plus one."
53:02;53:08;"And I wasn't there to do press or anything."
53:08;53:10;"So I roll with the crew."
53:10;53:13;"The people I were were actually actors in the guild."
53:13;53:14;"So we get there."
53:14;53:16;"They're going to do press."
53:16;53:19;"It's one of the most awful places to be and stressful."
53:19;53:20;"All these people--"
53:20;53:21;"OK, yeah."
53:21;53:21;"All these--"
53:21;53:23;"Time Held's showing me it."
53:23;53:24;"All these people are just--"
53:24;53:24;"You look lost."
53:24;53:26;"I was just trying to make a beeline to get off"
53:26;53:29;"of the carpet because there's literally"
53:29;53:30;"hundreds of photographers."
53:30;53:32;"People are just yelling, posing."
53:32;53:33;"So I was just making a beeline."
53:33;53:36;"And I guess I got caught in the back of a picture of some"
53:36;53:38;"of the people from the Big Bang Theory."
53:38;53:39;"I don't think you look lost, man."
53:39;53:41;"You look like James Bond or something in that."
53:41;53:44;"I'm just like, huh?"
53:44;53:48;"Jake, at Bands and Plants, what is that one thing/memory that"
53:48;53:50;"always makes you laugh when you think about it?"
53:50;53:53;"Bands and Plants is up in this."
53:53;53:56;"Asking the deep ones."
53:56;53:59;"Oh, jeez."
53:59;54:00;"That's a tough one."
54:00;54:02;"What's a pleasant memory?"
54:02;54:04;"Yeah, what's something that's always funny?"
54:04;54:10;"Big Lebowski."
54:10;54:12;"Yeah, that's true."
54:12;54:17;"Doing lines from Lebowski with my buddy Kyle."
54:17;54:19;"That's not really a memory."
54:19;54:21;"What about you and your brother?"
54:21;54:25;"Siblings always have old school jokes that--"
54:25;54:27;"OK."
54:27;54:29;"I think I was telling you this the other night."
54:29;54:30;"My brother and I--"
54:30;54:32;"because we listened to the oldie station all the time"
54:32;54:33;"growing up."
54:33;54:33;"Yeah."
54:33;54:35;"My mom loves the music of the '60s,"
54:35;54:37;"but the oldie station would play '60s,"
54:37;54:41;"and then it would get into pretty innocuous '70s pop,"
54:41;54:44;"or we'd get into Gary Puckett and the Union Gap,"
54:44;54:47;"like really bottom of the barrel, top 40 stuff."
54:47;54:50;"So my brother and I would figure out what song she hated,"
54:50;54:53;"and then we would sing them in the backseat of the car."
54:53;54:58;"Young girl, get out of my mind."
54:58;54:59;"Stop it, boys."
54:59;55:02;"Yeah, my love for you is way out of--"
55:02;55:05;"guys!"
55:05;55:09;"Something about that warms my heart."
55:09;55:11;"Another one from Anne--"
55:11;55:14;"or Anne, @BandsAndPlants."
55:14;55:17;"Oh, god, this is a real question."
55:17;55:20;"How can we get Americans to take climate change seriously"
55:20;55:22;"and make lifestyle changes to help prevent it?"
55:22;55:26;"OK, I'm glad we had one serious question."
55:26;55:28;"So everybody should check out this Naomi Klein book"
55:28;55:30;"from a couple of years ago."
55:30;55:33;"It's shocking and depressing, but also gives you some hope."
55:33;55:35;"It's called This Changes Everything, Capitalism"
55:35;55:37;"Versus the Climate."
55:37;55:39;"And she really explains, gets to the heart of it."
55:39;55:42;"Why would Koch brothers and all these right-wing billionaires"
55:42;55:45;"and people put so much money towards convincing people"
55:45;55:45;"it's not real?"
55:45;55:47;"And the answer is fairly simple, is"
55:47;55:51;"that they see attempts by the government"
55:51;55:53;"to limit the burning of fossil fuels or these things that"
55:53;55:56;"affect the environment as also limiting"
55:56;55:59;"the unfettered growth of their businesses."
55:59;56:01;"So they've put so much money into convincing"
56:01;56:04;"just regular people who really have no horse in the game, who"
56:04;56:06;"are only going to suffer because of this."
56:06;56:11;"So it's kind of shocking how organized the enemy is."
56:11;56:14;"How can we convince Americans to make lifestyle changes?"
56:14;56:15;"I mean, you're probably right."
56:15;56:19;"Unfortunately, the best way to deal with these big things"
56:19;56:20;"is for the government to set limitations"
56:20;56:22;"on how much you can pollute."
56:22;56:25;"The US wouldn't even agree to make sure"
56:25;56:28;"that the planet doesn't get more than a few degrees hotter."
56:28;56:30;"We're having a really hard time on a global scale."
56:30;56:32;"How do you get people to do it?"
56:32;56:34;"I mean, the brutal answer, it would"
56:34;56:38;"have to be continued climate disasters."
56:38;56:40;"And it might be too late by that point."
56:40;56:42;"By the time that--"
56:42;56:45;"already in our lifetimes, we've seen horrific things happening,"
56:45;56:48;"like Hurricane Katrina and stuff."
56:48;56:52;"It would probably have to be nonstop, even bigger events."
56:52;56:55;"And by the time people were like, OK, let's"
56:55;56:57;"do something about this, it might be too late."
56:57;56:59;"So what do you think, Jake?"
56:59;57:03;"Yeah, I mean, I guess not eat meat."
57:03;57:03;"That's a big one."
57:03;57:07;"Right, that's a good place to start."
57:07;57:11;"When you look at that stuff, how much water and also fossil fuels"
57:11;57:14;"go into creating a pound of beef, it's ridiculous."
57:14;57:18;"And all of the methane that cows fart out and burp out."
57:18;57:18;"It's insane."
57:18;57:20;"It's actually a real thing."
57:20;57:23;"I almost think that-- this is kind of messed up to say,"
57:23;57:28;"but I almost think that most people deep down don't care."
57:28;57:31;"Yeah, I wonder if you could straight up just say"
57:31;57:40;"to everybody in America, either you stop eating meat"
57:40;57:43;"or your great, great grandchildren"
57:43;57:48;"are going to die horrific deaths in a post-apocalyptic--"
57:48;57:48;"Famine."
57:48;57:50;"--famine."
57:50;57:51;"Yeah."
57:51;57:53;"Would people be like--"
57:53;57:56;"to actually picture people you're never going to meet,"
57:56;58:04;"just like Waterworld, Mad Max, The Road, just living that way."
58:04;58:06;"Would people really just be like, all right, I won't eat meat?"
58:06;58:09;"I bet future generations will look back at our time"
58:09;58:13;"and be like, what monsters."
58:13;58:16;"They knew what was happening, but they couldn't get their act"
58:16;58:19;"together to do anything."
58:19;58:20;"They're monsters."
58:20;58:22;"It's real bad."
58:22;58:26;"You've got an open heart, so you share what's inside,"
58:26;58:29;"thinking that all is said in confidence."
58:29;58:31;"But then you realize--"
58:31;58:37;"This heart is beating heavy."
58:37;58:41;"This heart is breaking my bones."
58:41;58:46;"This heart is incredibly unstable."
58:46;58:49;"It's over."
58:52;59:11;"Now you play your part."
59:11;59:13;"You're along for the ride, thinking"
59:13;59:15;"that all is said in confidence."
59:15;59:17;"Yeah, you realize--"
59:20;59:21;"Now I'm swimming the sea."
59:32;59:33;"I'm falling apart."
59:33;59:43;"I didn't know until I can't go see."
59:43;59:47;"My wings have been wasted."
59:47;59:50;"Oh, no, no, no."
59:50;59:51;"I've had enough."
01:01:03;01:01:18;"All right, Jake, you ready for the top five?"
01:01:18;01:01:19;"Mm-hmm."
01:01:19;01:01:24;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:01:24;01:01:29;"All right, because it's Grammy day,"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"we have to do a Grammy-based top five."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"It's actually not going to be quite a top five,"
01:01:33;01:01:37;"but because we're going to be comparing the songs nominated"
01:01:37;01:01:42;"for Song of the Year today for Grammys 2017,"
01:01:42;01:01:44;"and then we're going to go back to '81"
01:01:44;01:01:48;"for the first Grammys of the Reagan administration."
01:01:48;01:01:50;"That year, there were actually six songs recorded,"

01:02:34;01:02:36;"Well, one interesting thing about Song of the Year"
01:02:36;01:02:39;"is one of the few categories where the songwriters actually"
01:02:39;01:02:40;"win the Grammy."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"That's cool."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"Songwriter Amanda McBroom wrote the song"
01:02:44;01:02:47;"in response to her manager's suggestion"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"that she write some Bob Seger-type tunes"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"to get a record deal."
01:02:51;01:02:52;"I guess it's a little like--"
01:02:52;01:02:53;"Yeah."

01:05:31;01:05:32;"Yeah."
01:05:32;01:05:36;"It's like a unusual conceit for a modern pop song."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"I mean, it's basically--"
01:05:37;01:05:40;"Cats in the cradle and the silver spoon."

01:05:41;01:05:43;"It's like becoming your father."

01:05:52;01:05:55;"I think the most obvious precedent for the structure"
01:05:55;01:06:02;"is, when I was 17, it was a very good year."
01:06:02;01:06:05;"Because then it reverses, when I was--"

01:06:23;01:06:25;"It's a classic theme, but I mean,"

01:06:27;01:06:29;"aging and family and things like that."

01:06:32;01:06:34;"Yeah."
01:06:34;01:06:36;"Not that there's anything wrong with that."
01:06:36;01:06:42;"Let's go back to 1981 Grammys."

01:07:10;01:07:11;"the idea was that Lionel would come from R&B"

01:07:54;01:07:57;"is that it topped all four of Billboard's singles charts."
01:07:57;01:07:58;"Wow."
01:07:58;01:07:59;"Which back then--"
01:07:59;01:08:01;"I just want to point this out."
01:08:01;01:08:02;"Back then, the four singles charts"
01:08:02;01:08:03;"they had were the Hot 100--"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"of course, they still have that--"
01:08:05;01:08:10;"Country, Adult Contemporary, and Top Black Singles."
01:08:10;01:08:12;"That was the name of it?"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"Yeah, for a long time, there was a chart that was"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"called the Top Black Singles."
01:08:16;01:08:17;"But it's funny."
01:08:17;01:08:22;"So this song, I guess they thought that this belonged"
01:08:22;01:08:25;"in all four categories."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"Well, they thought it belonged in all four categories?"
01:08:27;01:08:28;"No, I mean, it was."
01:08:28;01:08:29;"Or just organically sold?"
01:08:29;01:08:30;"I don't know."
01:08:30;01:08:31;"Well, I don't know how it measured."
01:08:31;01:08:33;"I mean, were they actually monitoring--"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"that would have been crazy if they were actually"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"monitoring the consumers."
01:08:37;01:08:38;"Like, if you're black and you buy it,"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"it goes to the top single charts."
01:08:40;01:08:42;"If you're white and Southern, it goes to the country."
01:08:42;01:08:43;"Well, maybe it was on the radio, right?"
01:08:43;01:08:45;"On the country stations."
01:08:45;01:08:46;"I thought it was just sales."
01:08:46;01:08:47;"I don't know."
01:08:47;01:08:49;"That is bonkers."
01:08:49;01:08:52;"Yeah, and this is already in the '80s."
01:08:52;01:08:53;"Wow."
01:08:53;01:08:54;"Not a great song."
01:08:54;01:08:54;"Terrible song."
01:08:54;01:08:56;"[LAUGHS]"
01:08:56;01:08:58;"(SINGING) Lady."
01:08:58;01:09:02;"Let's get a little palate cleanser with a superior song"
01:09:02;01:09:03;"from our times."
01:09:03;01:09:06;"This one's Justin Bieber, ""Love Yourself,"" nominated"
01:09:06;01:09:06;"for Song of the Year."
01:09:06;01:09:11;"(SINGING) All the times that you're right in my parade."
01:09:11;01:09:13;"And all the clubs you get in using--"
01:09:13;01:09:18;"Is there like a predisposition to awarding ballads?"
01:09:18;01:09:20;"How come these are all ballads?"
01:09:20;01:09:23;"This is debatably a ballad."
01:09:23;01:09:25;"Well, compared to his other material."
01:09:25;01:09:26;"Yeah, you might be right."
01:09:26;01:09:29;"I mean, maybe--"
01:09:29;01:09:31;"Like melodramatic, kind of heavy."
01:09:31;01:09:33;"Maybe if they want to award songwriters,"
01:09:33;01:09:36;"they want to be like ballads have more gravitas."
01:09:36;01:09:37;"Right."
01:09:37;01:09:39;"Yeah, and I bet you're right."
01:09:39;01:09:44;"I bet like you're going to see less fun club songs."
01:09:44;01:09:45;"Right."
01:09:45;01:09:45;"Like who's to say--"
01:09:45;01:09:49;"I doubt Nelly was nominated for ""It's Getting Hot in Here."""
01:09:49;01:09:49;"Right."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"Even though it's probably--"
01:09:50;01:09:51;"Better than this song."
01:09:51;01:09:53;"Or tied."
01:09:53;01:09:54;"Or whatever was--"
01:09:54;01:09:54;"Tied for best."
01:09:54;01:09:57;"Well, whatever was nominated that year,"
01:09:57;01:09:58;"whatever the year that was."
01:09:58;01:09:59;"No two."
01:09:59;01:10:00;"I'm sure you're right."
01:10:00;01:10:02;"Probably there was a sense of like that the committee would"
01:10:02;01:10:05;"be like, oh, ""Hot in Here,"" that's not song of the year."
01:10:05;01:10:06;"That's a fun song."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"You know, don't get me wrong."
01:10:08;01:10:09;"It's a fun song, a few witty lines."
01:10:09;01:10:12;"But that's a party song versus like, why?"
01:10:12;01:10:16;"Why can't a party song be as well-written as--"
01:10:16;01:10:17;"Harder to write a good party song."
01:10:17;01:10:18;"It is harder."
01:10:18;01:10:19;"I agree."
01:10:19;01:10:21;"I got ballads for days."
01:10:21;01:10:21;"They're easy."
01:10:21;01:10:23;"That's the hard-- that's why it takes a long time"
01:10:23;01:10:24;"to finish an album is because you've"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"got to write the fast songs."
01:10:26;01:10:27;"It's a pro tip."
01:10:27;01:10:31;"One fun thing about this, similar to Lionel Richie"
01:10:31;01:10:35;"writing ""Lady"" for Kenny Rogers, Ed Sheeran"
01:10:35;01:10:37;"wrote this song for Justin Bieber."
01:10:37;01:10:38;"OK."
01:10:38;01:10:39;"You know, it's nice to see pop stars helping"
01:10:39;01:10:43;"each other out, collaborating."
01:10:43;01:10:45;"I don't mind this song."
01:10:45;01:10:45;"This is a good song."
01:10:45;01:10:48;"I like the voicings on the chords."
01:10:48;01:10:49;"Yeah, and it's cool."
01:10:49;01:10:50;"There's no drums."
01:10:50;01:10:50;"It's so minimalist."
01:10:50;01:10:52;"Yeah."
01:10:52;01:10:54;"And baby, I'll be moving on."
01:10:54;01:10:56;"And I think it should be something"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"I don't want to hold back."
01:10:58;01:11:03;"Maybe you should know that my mama don't like you,"
01:11:03;01:11:06;"and she likes everyone."
01:11:06;01:11:10;"And I never like to admit that I was wrong."
01:11:10;01:11:13;"And I've been so caught up in my job,"
01:11:13;01:11:16;"didn't see what's going on."
01:11:16;01:11:20;"But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own."
01:11:20;01:11:26;"Because if you like the way you look that much, oh, baby,"
01:11:26;01:11:30;"you should go and love yourself."
01:11:30;01:11:35;"And if you think that I'm still holding on to something,"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"you should go and love yourself."
01:11:37;01:11:59;"[MUSIC - BABY, ""LOVE YOURSELF""]"
01:11:59;01:12:03;"For all the times that you made me feel small,"
01:12:03;01:12:08;"I fell in love now I feel nothing at all."
01:12:08;01:12:13;"I never felt so low when I was vulnerable."
01:12:13;01:12:18;"Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?"
01:12:18;01:12:23;"Because if you like the way you look that much, oh, baby,"
01:12:23;01:12:27;"you should go and love yourself."
01:12:27;01:12:33;"And if you think that I'm still holding on to something,"
01:12:33;01:12:37;"you should go and love yourself."
01:12:37;01:12:43;"Because if you like the way you look that much, oh, baby,"
01:12:43;01:12:46;"you should go and love yourself."
01:12:46;01:12:49;"That seems like a fair thing to nominate for Song of the Year."
01:12:49;01:12:52;"Let's go back to 1981."
01:12:52;01:12:53;"Irene Cara."
01:12:53;01:12:53;"Remember her?"
01:12:53;01:12:54;"No."
01:12:54;01:12:55;"Maybe you'll remember this song."
01:12:55;01:12:59;"[MUSIC - IRENE CARA, ""BALLAD COUNTRY""]"
01:12:59;01:13:00;"We're out of ballad country here."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"Yeah, now we get something up-tempo."
01:13:02;01:13:03;"Is this from a movie?"
01:13:03;01:13:06;"[MUSIC - IRENE CARA, ""BALLAD COUNTRY""]"
01:13:06;01:13:17;"It's from a movie called Fame, a song called Fame."
01:13:17;01:13:17;"Oh, OK."
01:13:17;01:13:18;"Remember that movie?"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"I never saw it."
01:13:20;01:13:23;"I think we could categorize this as post-disco,"
01:13:23;01:13:26;"like early '80s, still kind of rooted in a disco groove,"
01:13:26;01:13:30;"but not quite disco, moving towards something else."
01:13:30;01:13:33;"Kind of a lateral move from Steely Dan."
01:13:33;01:13:35;"Yeah, this could be a Steely Dan song."
01:13:35;01:13:37;"[MUSIC - IRENE CARA, ""BALLAD COUNTRY""]"
01:13:37;01:13:38;"Oh, she's got a good voice."
01:13:38;01:13:41;"[MUSIC - IRENE CARA, ""BALLAD COUNTRY""]"
01:13:41;01:13:45;"[MUSIC - IRENE CARA, ""BALLAD COUNTRY""]"
01:14:11;01:14:34;"What was Fame about?"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"Was that a disco movie?"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"It's about kids at the Performing Arts High School"
01:14:38;01:14:39;"in New York."
01:14:39;01:14:40;"OK."
01:14:40;01:14:42;"This kind of has the same chord progression"
01:14:42;01:14:45;"and melodic motion that we talked about as Tony Braxton"
01:14:45;01:14:46;"in Metallica."
01:14:46;01:14:50;"Fame, fame, I'm going to live forever."
01:14:50;01:14:53;"So I dub thee unforgiving."
01:14:53;01:14:55;"Unbreak my fame."
01:14:55;01:14:58;"I'm going to live forever."
01:14:58;01:15:01;"So I dub thee unforgiving."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"You label me."
01:15:03;01:15:06;"Unbreak my heart."
01:15:06;01:15:08;"Anyway, that song was written by Michael Gore and Dean"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"Pitchford."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"I think Metallica has a song nominated this year."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"Oh, really, for like best rock?"
01:15:13;01:15:14;"Yeah, I was driving today."
01:15:14;01:15:16;"And I was listening to Kayla West,"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"which is a terrible station."
01:15:18;01:15:22;"But it's sort of like the hard rock station in LA."
01:15:22;01:15:23;"Oh, it's like heavy stuff?"
01:15:23;01:15:25;"Well, it's like classic rock, but also heavy."
01:15:25;01:15:30;"You know, yeah, like new Metallica, or like, you know,"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"Alice in Chains kind of stuff."
01:15:32;01:15:33;"But that's right."
01:15:33;01:15:35;"And so the DJ was like, Lady Gaga's"
01:15:35;01:15:39;"performing with Metallica at the Grammys this year."
01:15:39;01:15:42;"Yeah, the Grammys loves to pair people together."
01:15:42;01:15:46;"Do kind of surprising mashups, so to speak."
01:15:46;01:15:48;"And they were nominated for best rock song."
01:15:48;01:15:49;"Anyway."
01:15:49;01:15:52;"Let's go back to our era."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"This was a big one this year."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"Adele."
01:15:56;01:15:57;"Hello."
01:15:57;01:15:59;"So this will win, right?"
01:15:59;01:16:01;"Oh, wait."
01:16:01;01:16:02;"This or the--"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"This is probably going to win, I would guess."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"Wait, are you up for song or record?"
01:16:06;01:16:07;"Album."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"Oh, album."
01:16:08;01:16:09;"Song and record."
01:16:09;01:16:10;"Record is song."
01:16:10;01:16:11;"No."
01:16:11;01:16:13;"Song is for the songwriters."
01:16:13;01:16:15;"Record is for the artist."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"For the recording."
01:16:16;01:16:21;"Sometimes song and record will go to the same song."
01:16:21;01:16:22;"So who wrote this?"
01:16:22;01:16:27;"I believe Adele wrote it with Greg Kirsten, the producer."
01:16:27;01:16:30;"[MUSIC - ADELE, ""CAN YOU HEAR ME""]"
01:16:30;01:16:36;"I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be when"
01:16:36;01:16:43;"we were younger and free."
01:16:43;01:16:48;"I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet."
01:16:48;01:16:58;"There's such a difference between us and a million miles."
01:16:59;01:17:04;"How long from the other side?"
01:17:04;01:17:13;"I must have called a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"for everything that I've done."
01:17:15;01:17:22;"But when I call, you never seem to be home."
01:17:22;01:17:26;"How long from the other side?"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"How long from the outside?"
01:17:28;01:17:40;"At least I can say that I've tried to tell you I'm sorry"
01:17:40;01:17:43;"for breaking your heart."
01:17:43;01:17:45;"But it don't matter."
01:17:45;01:17:49;"It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore."
01:17:49;01:17:56;"Couldn't you see Metallica covering this?"
01:17:56;01:17:59;"Man, Adele should have performed with Metallica, not Lady Gaga."
01:17:59;01:18:00;"That would have been sick."
01:18:01;01:18:03;"She starts this, and then Kirk--"
01:18:03;01:18:04;"[MIMICS DRUMMING]"
01:18:04;01:18:05;"Oh, yeah."
01:18:05;01:18:07;"Oh, man, that'd be sick."
01:18:07;01:18:11;"Lars, just like that drum face."
01:18:11;01:18:15;"Just the double bass drum pedal going buck wild."
01:18:15;01:18:16;"Boom."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"Or if they medleyed into ""Unforgiven,"" dude."
01:18:18;01:18:20;"Oh, that'd be sick."
01:18:20;01:18:23;"Kirk and Hetfield just doing harmonized guitars."
01:18:23;01:18:26;"[MIMICS GUITAR]"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"[MIMICS DRUMMING]"
01:18:28;01:18:29;"Yeah."
01:18:29;01:18:33;"[MIMICS DRUMMING]"
01:18:33;01:18:35;"Man, wow."
01:18:35;01:18:36;"That's a missed opportunity."
01:18:36;01:18:37;"That's a real missed opportunity."
01:18:37;01:18:41;"No disrespect to Lady Gaga, but Adele and Metallica?"
01:18:41;01:18:43;"That'd be so sick."
01:18:43;01:18:45;"And maybe like an orchestra."
01:18:45;01:18:47;"Remember when Metallica made their orchestral album?"
01:18:47;01:18:50;"Yeah, it's-- Metallica's a trip to think about."
01:18:50;01:18:52;"Because in the '80s, they were like scary."
01:18:52;01:18:53;"Yeah."
01:18:53;01:18:55;"And they had no interest in appealing to the mainstream"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"or being liked."
01:18:57;01:19:00;"And it's like, at some point, maybe after the Black album,"
01:19:00;01:19:04;"they were just like, we'll do anything."
01:19:04;01:19:05;"So sort of like--"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"I mean, I'm not really bagging on them."
01:19:07;01:19:08;"They did it."
01:19:08;01:19:09;"No, they did it."
01:19:09;01:19:10;"They have cred."
01:19:10;01:19:13;"And even like some of the post-haircut music was good."
01:19:13;01:19:14;"Was it?"
01:19:14;01:19:18;"Yeah, I mean, I don't know."
01:19:18;01:19:19;"I'm not like--"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"I'm not trying to be all neg head on Metallica."
01:19:21;01:19:24;"It's just like-- maybe just--"
01:19:24;01:19:25;"well, you know--"
01:19:25;01:19:26;"My memory of them as a kid was like--"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"They went back to scary speed metal."
01:19:28;01:19:29;"Right."
01:19:29;01:19:30;"But it was no longer scary."
01:19:30;01:19:32;"These guys have hundreds of millions of dollars"
01:19:32;01:19:33;"and ride horses."
01:19:33;01:19:36;"So of course, they're not going to be quite as scary."
01:19:36;01:19:38;"The only way for a person with hundreds of millions of dollars"
01:19:38;01:19:41;"to be scary is by doing like Koch Brothers stuff."
01:19:41;01:19:43;"Are you running for president?"
01:19:43;01:19:46;"Yes, running for president."
01:19:46;01:19:48;"Hey, Hetfield, if you really want to scare us again,"
01:19:48;01:19:49;"run for president."
01:19:49;01:19:51;"Yeah, that's next level."
01:19:51;01:19:55;"Can you still tell me, see, Hetfield, Libertarian Party?"
01:19:55;01:19:56;"Oh, yeah."
01:19:56;01:19:58;"Hetfield Johnson."
01:19:58;01:20:00;"He would totally-- he would have that kind of like--"
01:20:00;01:20:03;"that like Joe Rogan, like Bill Burr."
01:20:03;01:20:04;"Totally, totally."
01:20:04;01:20:06;"Where they'd be like, so what do you think of--"
01:20:06;01:20:07;"imagine if he's in this race."
01:20:07;01:20:13;"You'd think like-- so all right, Hillary Trump, who's better?"
01:20:13;01:20:14;"Honestly?"
01:20:14;01:20:17;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:20:17;01:20:20;"I'd love to smack the [BLEEP] out of both of them."
01:20:20;01:20:22;"I got no time for either."
01:20:22;01:20:27;"Just two sides of the same coin, man."
01:20:27;01:20:28;"It's really--"
01:20:28;01:20:31;"Yeah, but then unable to articulate what that means."
01:20:31;01:20:32;"What do you mean?"
01:20:32;01:20:33;"I mean--"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"You're literally saying that Hillary's as bad as Trump?"
01:20:35;01:20:36;"Yep."
01:20:36;01:20:37;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:20:37;01:20:38;"Why?"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"They're all part of the same system."
01:20:40;01:20:44;"Part of the same system, man."
01:20:44;01:20:47;"Anyway, Adele plus Metallica."
01:20:47;01:20:49;"I was just handed a piece of paper."
01:20:49;01:20:52;"It would be Modelica."
01:20:52;01:20:55;"Maybe get Modelo in on that, too."
01:20:55;01:20:59;"Modelo presents Modelica."
01:20:59;01:21:03;"They'd make like special nine ounce cans of Modelica."
01:21:03;01:21:07;"Oh, man."
01:21:07;01:21:09;"That is such a type of dude, like a Hetfield dude,"
01:21:09;01:21:12;"who's just like all part of the same system, man."
01:21:12;01:21:16;"You totally right about the Rogan fan base, too."
01:21:16;01:21:19;"They're both scumbags."
01:21:19;01:21:22;"I mean, you know that we're--"
01:21:22;01:21:26;"we don't love the Democrats on ""Time Crisis."""
01:21:26;01:21:28;"But at the same time, you just got"
01:21:28;01:21:33;"to shake your head at that, just like hardcore, just like--"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"they're both--"
01:21:35;01:21:36;"that's so lame."
01:21:36;01:21:39;"We got to like--"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"like, you can talk about what the problem is"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"with the Republicans and the--"
01:21:43;01:21:44;"but I mean, come on."
01:21:44;01:21:46;"I bet there's still-- like, even today,"
01:21:46;01:21:51;"the Hetfields will be like, Trump, he's no good, man."
01:21:51;01:21:54;"But I'm honestly terrified to see what the Democrats are"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"going to come with in 2020."
01:21:56;01:21:58;"That's why I'm running."
01:21:58;01:21:59;"Terrified."
01:21:59;01:22:01;"Actually, I feel bad imagining all this shit about Hetfield."
01:22:01;01:22:03;"He's probably just like a chill dude."
01:22:03;01:22:05;"I actually listened to Hetfield on ""Marion"" a few weeks ago."
01:22:05;01:22:06;"Oh, yeah?"
01:22:06;01:22:07;"He's like a sensitive guy."
01:22:07;01:22:08;"Yeah, he was chill."
01:22:08;01:22:13;"Like, I think they skirted around politics."
01:22:13;01:22:14;"And he was sort of like--"
01:22:14;01:22:15;"You know what's funny?"
01:22:15;01:22:18;"Like, people also forget these dudes are from San Francisco."
01:22:18;01:22:19;"Oh, dude."
01:22:19;01:22:20;"Actually, well, check this out, man."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"This came up in the interview."
01:22:21;01:22:23;"He and his family left San Francisco"
01:22:23;01:22:27;"and moved to like rural Colorado and live on some like huge"
01:22:27;01:22:29;"property in rural Colorado."
01:22:29;01:22:31;"And he was sort of like, I started"
01:22:31;01:22:34;"to feel pretty uncomfortable around San Francisco."
01:22:34;01:22:35;"Oh, no."
01:22:35;01:22:36;"Yeah, it was a little bit like--"
01:22:36;01:22:37;"Is that like coded homophobia?"
01:22:37;01:22:38;"No, it wasn't homophobia."
01:22:38;01:22:40;"He was just sort of like, you know,"
01:22:40;01:22:46;"all the political correctness, you know, like, guy like me."
01:22:46;01:22:48;"It was a little vague."
01:22:48;01:22:50;"I think he was sort of just like, listen,"
01:22:50;01:22:54;"I like to hunt and like shoot guns and like drive big SUVs."
01:22:54;01:22:55;"Right."
01:22:55;01:22:56;"All good."
01:22:56;01:22:57;"Whatever."
01:22:57;01:23:01;"It's not like Metallica, at least that I can think of,"
01:23:01;01:23:04;"was ever like had sexist or racist lyrics."
01:23:04;01:23:05;"I mean, maybe I'm wrong."
01:23:05;01:23:08;"Like their brand of like offensiveness"
01:23:08;01:23:12;"was more just like, like, death, destruction."
01:23:12;01:23:14;"Like, I don't know."
01:23:14;01:23:16;"There's no left wingers."
01:23:16;01:23:19;"Blackened to begin the dance of the dead."
01:23:19;01:23:21;"Like, that's some real '80s--"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"like, oh, the PC police don't like it"
01:23:23;01:23:28;"when we sing about darkness imprisoning us."
01:23:28;01:23:29;"Nobody cares, man."
01:23:29;01:23:33;"It was interesting to think about San Francisco"
01:23:33;01:23:36;"awash in like tech money and like being the most"
01:23:36;01:23:37;"liberal city in the country."
01:23:37;01:23:39;"Like, him feeling out of step with like--"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"I think he was living in Marin County."
01:23:41;01:23:44;"And actually, dude, I have a Metallica SUV story."
01:23:44;01:23:45;"Really?"
01:23:45;01:23:46;"Because I used to live in San Francisco"
01:23:46;01:23:49;"and I used to deliver groceries out of the Whole Foods"
01:23:49;01:23:50;"at Franklin in California."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"And Kirk Hammett, the lead guitarist,"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"would always come in to that Whole Foods."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"I'd see him there all the time."
01:23:56;01:23:59;"And he drove this like huge white Escalade."
01:23:59;01:24:02;"And the garage underneath the Whole Foods"
01:24:02;01:24:05;"was so tiny, like San Francisco style."
01:24:05;01:24:07;"You know, like, super hard to maneuver."
01:24:07;01:24:10;"And like, you had to like back into every space."
01:24:10;01:24:13;"And he had this ginormous white Escalade."
01:24:13;01:24:15;"I remember him coming like within like an eighth"
01:24:15;01:24:18;"of an inch this time of like just scraping"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"the entire side of his white Escalade"
01:24:20;01:24:23;"against this like concrete pillar."
01:24:23;01:24:25;"I mean, that's cool he still wants to go"
01:24:25;01:24:26;"buy his groceries in person."
01:24:26;01:24:27;"That's true."
01:24:27;01:24:29;"I wish I delivered to him."
01:24:29;01:24:32;"Mr. Hammett, I hope I'm not overstepping, man."
01:24:32;01:24:34;"But you're always coming in here driving"
01:24:34;01:24:35;"your beautiful white Escalade."
01:24:35;01:24:37;"You're coming awful close to scratching that thing up."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"I just want to introduce myself."
01:24:39;01:24:40;"My name is Jake Longstrip."
01:24:40;01:24:44;"I work for Shop Hoppers."
01:24:44;01:24:48;"I'm a delivery associate at Shop Hoppers."
01:24:48;01:24:50;"And I--"
01:24:50;01:24:53;"Marin County is within our area."
01:24:53;01:24:55;"I think I could make your life a whole heck of a lot easier,"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"Mr. Hammett."
01:24:56;01:24:59;"[laughter]"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"Kirk always seemed like a real nice guy."
01:25:01;01:25:03;"Yeah, seemed like a real sweetheart."
01:25:03;01:25:05;"Yeah, he's the sweet one."
01:25:05;01:25:08;"Anyway, Grammys."
01:25:08;01:25:09;"Missed opportunity."
01:25:10;01:25:12;"I'm going to be shaking my head tonight"
01:25:12;01:25:16;"when I watch Lady Gaga take the stage with Metallica."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"What are they going to do?"
01:25:17;01:25:18;"What are her songs?"
01:25:18;01:25:20;"Probably a mashup."
01:25:20;01:25:24;"[imitating guitar]"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"Say your prayers, little one."
01:25:26;01:25:27;"Oh, I hope they don't do that."
01:25:27;01:25:29;"That'll suck."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"I mean, great song, but it's like--"
01:25:31;01:25:32;"Her singing, yeah."
01:25:32;01:25:33;"She's got great songs."
01:25:33;01:25:34;"They have great songs."
01:25:34;01:25:36;"I wish they did, like, early stuff, man."
01:25:36;01:25:39;"Well, their new stuff is, like, speed metal again."
01:25:39;01:25:40;"Is it?"
01:25:40;01:25:41;"Yeah."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"It's good?"
01:25:42;01:25:44;"It's good."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"OK."
01:25:45;01:25:47;"Adele's probably going to win."
01:25:47;01:25:48;"That's my pick."
01:25:48;01:25:49;"Yeah, yeah, I feel you."
01:25:49;01:25:51;"Back to 1981."
01:25:51;01:25:54;"We got Barbra Streisand with ""Woman in Love."""
01:25:54;01:25:56;"What a funny-- like--"
01:25:56;01:25:57;"Yeah."
01:25:57;01:25:58;"I mean--"
01:25:58;01:25:59;"We've had Midler and Streisand."
01:25:59;01:26:02;"Midler, Streisand, Kenny Rogers."
01:26:02;01:26:04;"It's the old crew."
01:26:04;01:26:06;"So Barbra Streisand, ""Woman in Love."""
01:26:06;01:26:07;"I don't know the song."
01:26:14;01:26:24;"It's a pretty schlocky year."
01:26:24;01:26:26;"Yeah, I mean, where was, like, Journey"
01:26:26;01:26:29;"and all those kind of bands?"
01:26:29;01:26:32;"Life is a moment in space."
01:26:32;01:26:33;"Oh, this is a good one."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"You know this song?"
01:26:34;01:26:35;"Yeah."
01:26:35;01:26:36;"""In."""
01:26:39;01:26:46;"Chord changes are nuts on this."
01:26:49;01:27:02;"Yeah."
01:27:06;01:27:09;"Yeah, this is early '81, so we're"
01:27:09;01:27:10;"basically still in the '70s."
01:27:10;01:27:11;"Yeah."
01:27:14;01:27:26;"Oh, wait, this is just like that Britney Spears song."
01:27:26;01:27:28;"Yeah, oh, that's what I was thinking."
01:27:31;01:27:32;"Or I was thinking--"
01:27:33;01:27:34;"Yeah, yeah, that one."
01:27:37;01:27:40;"I played with you."
01:27:40;01:27:41;"Yeah."
01:27:41;01:27:44;"Oh, babe, oops, I did it again."
01:27:44;01:27:48;"I wouldn't be shocked if Max Martin, those Swedish guys,"
01:27:48;01:27:50;"because, you know, they're real students of what"
01:27:50;01:27:51;"makes pop songs tick."
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Yeah."
01:27:52;01:27:53;"They're always going back to old songs"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"and studying the melodies."
01:27:55;01:27:57;"I mean, he could get sued for that."
01:27:57;01:27:58;"That's pretty damn close."
01:27:58;01:28:00;"I'd never recommend musicians suing each other,"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"because it's like--"
01:28:01;01:28:02;"No, no, no, I wasn't saying that."
01:28:02;01:28:04;"I just think, like, you're just going to--"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"what, you're going to ruin Britney Spears' day just"
01:28:06;01:28:08;"to get Barbra Streisand and another few mil?"
01:28:08;01:28:09;"Well, she didn't write it."
01:28:09;01:28:10;"Did she?"
01:28:10;01:28:11;"Probably not."
01:28:11;01:28:12;"[laughs]"
01:28:12;01:28:13;"Come on, man, do your homework."
01:28:13;01:28:14;"All right."
01:28:14;01:28:16;"Oh, dude, OK, ""Woman in Love,"" written"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"by Barry Gibb and Robin Gibb."
01:28:17;01:28:18;"Oh, OK, yeah, she was--"
01:28:18;01:28:19;"That makes a hell of a lot of sense."
01:28:19;01:28:21;"--she was real mobbed up with the Bee Gees."
01:28:21;01:28:22;"Oh, dude."
01:28:22;01:28:23;"Yeah, she had this duet."
01:28:23;01:28:24;"Yeah, last week."
01:28:24;01:28:26;"So--"
01:28:26;01:28:28;"From the album ""Guilty."""
01:28:28;01:28:30;"Maybe I got to check out this album."
01:28:30;01:28:33;"Never been a huge Barbra fan, but I'm curious."
01:28:33;01:28:36;"So back to our era, the 2017 nominees."
01:28:36;01:28:37;"Yeah, yeah."
01:28:37;01:28:40;"We can't play this song, because it's by Beyonce."
01:28:40;01:28:41;"OK."
01:28:41;01:28:44;"But the song everybody knows, it's called ""Formation."""
01:28:44;01:28:46;"You know that song, right?"
01:28:46;01:28:48;"Yeah, if I heard it, I would know it."
01:28:48;01:28:50;"The hook goes, ""OK, ladies, now let's get in formation."""
01:28:50;01:28:52;"And she played it at the Super Bowl last year."
01:28:52;01:28:53;"Right."
01:28:53;01:28:55;"This is a cool mix of people who wrote this."
01:28:55;01:28:58;"Kahlief Brown, who's one of the guys from ""Ray Shremmered,"""
01:28:58;01:29:02;"apparently he had the concept for the phrase ""Formation."""
01:29:02;01:29:06;"Jordan Frost, Ashton Hogan, Mike Will made it, and Beyonce."
01:29:06;01:29:08;"Definitely one of the big songs of the year."
01:29:08;01:29:09;"Yeah."
01:29:09;01:29:11;"Now, what's interesting about that is, like you were saying,"
01:29:11;01:29:13;"they go-- 10s in this category, song of the year,"
01:29:13;01:29:15;"they go pretty conservative."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"Get a lot of these middle-of-the-road ballads."
01:29:17;01:29:18;"Yeah."
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Just kind of classic heartstring stuff."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"""Once I was seven years old."""
01:29:22;01:29:24;"""Hello, it's me."""
01:29:24;01:29:26;"""Fame."""
01:29:26;01:29:28;"You know, there's something all these have in common."
01:29:28;01:29:29;"Yeah."
01:29:29;01:29:31;"""Formation"" is probably the most different."
01:29:31;01:29:34;"It's like a political song, it's got a ton of personality."
01:29:34;01:29:36;"This is the one that has the line, ""I got hot sauce in my bag."""
01:29:36;01:29:38;"Oh, right, OK."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"This has a lot of personality."
01:29:39;01:29:42;"It's a more progressive song."
01:29:42;01:29:44;"You mean like progressive rock?"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"You know, in a way."
01:29:46;01:29:49;"But this song, we can't play it, but I could impersonate it."
01:29:49;01:29:51;"This song starts out with literally just--"
01:29:51;01:29:55;"[imitating music]"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"It's like you don't even know what the sound is."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"It's like the strange sound."
01:29:58;01:30:00;"It could almost be a guitar or like hitting a piece of metal."
01:30:00;01:30:03;"[imitating music]"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"And then there's like these samples and stuff."
01:30:05;01:30:07;"It's progressive in terms of like having an unusual structure"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"and whatever."
01:30:09;01:30:14;"So anyway, will the Grammy committee go for it?"
01:30:14;01:30:15;"Probably not."
01:30:15;01:30:16;"They're going to go for ""Hello."""
01:30:16;01:30:17;"That's my guess."
01:30:17;01:30:18;"Right."
01:30:18;01:30:21;"Back to 1981, this is a hilarious mix of people"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"who were nominated that year."
01:30:23;01:30:30;"Hitler, Streisand, Kenny Rogers, Irene Cara, and Frank Sinatra."
01:30:30;01:30:32;"Really?"
01:30:32;01:30:36;"People always forget how late this song is from."
01:30:36;01:30:38;"Yeah, I had no idea it was from '81."

01:41:05;01:41:09;"I get to go on tour and play, like, weird shows, but it's sad."""
01:41:09;01:41:12;"His stack of cash is like his golden horn, dude."
01:41:12;01:41:15;"Yeah, exactly. Cold comfort."
01:41:15;01:41:16;"Yeah."
01:41:16;01:41:23;"When you have a bad day, yeah, he can log in to the Bank of America app"
01:41:23;01:41:26;"on his iPhone 6, look at that fat number,"
01:41:26;01:41:29;"but that doesn't make the phone ring."
01:41:29;01:41:33;"That doesn't stop that girl from walking out that door because..."
01:41:33;01:41:34;"It might."
01:41:34;01:41:36;"[laughter]"
01:41:36;01:41:42;"All right, but not-- you know a quality significant other wouldn't care."
01:41:42;01:41:43;"I don't know."
01:41:43;01:41:46;"I like hearing both versions of the song."
01:41:46;01:41:47;"Yeah."
01:41:47;01:41:50;"♪ You don't want to be high like this ♪"
01:41:50;01:41:52;"You know what, that's also, like, a classic question."
01:41:52;01:41:56;"I think one that's come up on Time Crisis here and there."
01:41:56;01:42:02;"Are the highs and lows of life worth the pain, the whiplash?"
01:42:02;01:42:04;"Would you rather just set things on cruise control"
01:42:04;01:42:07;"and just have every day be fine?"
01:42:07;01:42:12;"Are those amazing moments worth the inevitable crash that follows?"
01:42:12;01:42:14;"Yeah, probably."
01:42:14;01:42:17;"For every birth, there's a death?"
01:42:17;01:42:18;"Yeah."
01:42:18;01:42:23;"For every sick party, there's a horrible party?"
01:42:23;01:42:24;"There's the hangover."
01:42:24;01:42:25;"Right."
01:42:25;01:42:28;"Posner's hitting some deep questions."
01:42:28;01:42:31;"You know what, man? Posner for Song of the Year."
01:42:31;01:42:32;"No, Formation."
01:42:32;01:42:34;"Big upset."
01:42:34;01:42:35;"Imagine if he won."
01:42:35;01:42:36;"That'd be funny."
01:42:36;01:42:38;"I got to say, I do actually kind of like--"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"I respect every song that's nominated this year."
01:42:40;01:42:44;"Seven Years, probably my least favorite, but I like--"
01:42:44;01:42:47;"There is an element of craft in all of these songs."
01:42:47;01:42:49;"Seven Years, you got to give it up for the craft."
01:42:49;01:42:51;"It's not my favorite, but I respect it."
01:42:51;01:42:54;"Love Yourself by Bieber, it's tight."
01:42:54;01:42:56;"Hello by Adele, got to respect the craft."
01:42:56;01:42:59;"Took a pill on Ibiza, heart-wrenching."
01:42:59;01:43:02;"Formation, like legitimately great song."
01:43:02;01:43:05;"Formation is the only song that's firing on all cylinders,"
01:43:05;01:43:06;"I would say."
01:43:06;01:43:11;"I think that Barry Gibb pen song for Barbra Streisand was--"
01:43:11;01:43:12;"Firing on all cylinders."
01:43:12;01:43:16;"Yeah, that's-- in terms of craft, that one is far and away"
01:43:16;01:43:17;"the best."
01:43:17;01:43:18;"Well, actually, we didn't even finish."
01:43:18;01:43:21;"We got to go back to 1981 one more time, because in 1981,"
01:43:21;01:43:24;"there were six songs nominated instead of five."
01:43:24;01:43:27;"I am a woman in love."
01:43:27;01:43:32;"So Bombshell, none of the ones we listened to so far won."
01:43:32;01:43:33;"Oh."
01:43:33;01:43:34;"Whoa, OK."
01:43:34;01:43:36;"Because obviously we don't know what's going to win tonight,"
01:43:36;01:43:39;"but we do know what won in 1981."
01:43:39;01:43:40;"Song of the Year 1981."
01:43:40;01:43:43;"Hit me."
01:43:43;01:43:44;"Debut album."
01:43:44;01:43:46;"Let me see if I recognize it."
01:43:46;01:43:49;"Sweet Young Man from Texas."
01:43:49;01:43:52;"Oh."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"Marked it."
01:43:54;01:43:55;"You know it already?"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"It's not too far to paradise."
01:43:57;01:43:58;"So who is it?"
01:43:58;01:43:59;"Christopher Cross, dude."
01:43:59;01:44:00;"Right."
01:44:00;01:44:01;"What's the song called?"
01:44:01;01:44:02;"Sailing."
01:44:02;01:44:03;"The epitome of yacht rock."
01:44:03;01:44:05;"This is peak yacht rock."
01:44:05;01:44:06;"It's literally called Sailing."
01:44:06;01:44:08;"I love this guitar tone, though."
01:44:08;01:44:09;"Yeah."
01:44:09;01:44:10;"It's pretty Smashing Pumpkin."
01:44:10;01:44:13;"It's pretty melancholy, and even in sadness, that tone."
01:44:13;01:44:16;"[HUMMING]"
01:44:16;01:44:17;"It's also a little bit like Graceland."
01:44:17;01:44:22;"[MUSIC - GRACELAND, ""SHAKING PUMPKIN""]"
01:44:22;01:44:24;"People hated this when it came out."
01:44:24;01:44:28;"This was-- like, the cool people thought this was garbage."
01:44:28;01:44:33;"His voice is kind of Billy Corgan, too."
01:44:33;01:44:34;"Excellent."
01:44:34;01:44:37;"Like, with a softer Corgan."
01:44:37;01:44:39;"(SINGING) Oh, the fame."
01:44:39;01:44:41;"Yeah."
01:44:41;01:44:44;"(SINGING) Oh, the kind of America."
01:44:44;01:44:49;"Pumpkins should cover this, dude."
01:44:49;01:44:50;"I mean--"
01:44:53;01:44:54;"That harmony is sick."
01:44:54;01:44:56;"So for anybody who doesn't remember this song,"
01:44:56;01:44:58;"this was like a huge hit back then."
01:44:58;01:45:00;"And he's this kind of like sweet--"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"I think he was kind of like on the chubby side."
01:45:02;01:45:04;"Yeah, like balding slightly."
01:45:04;01:45:06;"Yeah, like not--"
01:45:06;01:45:08;"I guess you would say an average looking guy."
01:45:08;01:45:09;"Yeah."
01:45:09;01:45:14;"You know, like not like some gorgeous model-esque person."
01:45:14;01:45:15;"So he's like a sweet dude."
01:45:15;01:45:17;"Had this big first album."
01:45:17;01:45:19;"(SINGING) Sailing."
01:45:19;01:45:22;"And you know, the song is like this yacht rock"
01:45:22;01:45:24;"thing about daydreaming, about just sailing"
01:45:24;01:45:27;"to get away from your problems or whatever,"
01:45:27;01:45:30;"or whatever, getting with your girl again."
01:45:30;01:45:33;"And-- but people really didn't like this."
01:45:33;01:45:34;"And actually--"
01:45:34;01:45:39;"But it was also obviously hugely popular, too."
01:45:39;01:45:40;"As is often the case."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"(SINGING) Fantasy."
01:45:42;01:45:46;"I think it's the best of me."
01:45:46;01:45:47;"I'm sailing."
01:45:47;01:45:56;"All caught up in the red rain."
01:45:56;01:45:57;"Every word is--"
01:45:57;01:46:00;"You know, that whole album is pretty good, actually."
01:46:00;01:46:01;"Yeah, what was the other big single?"
01:46:01;01:46:02;"I've spent time with that album."
01:46:02;01:46:03;"OK."
01:46:03;01:46:05;"But it was years ago."
01:46:05;01:46:12;"(SINGING) Sailing takes me away to where I'm going."
01:46:12;01:46:16;"Word is broken."
01:46:16;01:46:18;"I'm lost, I'm lost."
01:46:18;01:46:21;"I dream of where you carry me."
01:46:21;01:46:23;"Soon I will be free."
01:46:28;01:46:32;"[music - ""it's not my bad to sail away""]"
01:46:54;01:46:58;"(SINGING) It's not my bad to sail away."
01:46:58;01:47:01;"The beast is not my friend."
01:47:01;01:47:05;"The wind is right to sail away."
01:47:05;01:47:07;"Find serenity."
01:47:07;01:47:11;"Oh, the canvas can do miracles."
01:47:11;01:47:14;"Just you wait and see."
01:47:14;01:47:16;"And it will be me."
01:47:21;01:47:27;"Sailing takes me away to where I'm going."
01:47:27;01:47:29;"And it will be me."
01:47:29;01:47:37;"Just a free wind to carry me."
01:47:37;01:47:39;"Soon I will be free."
01:47:39;01:47:41;"We got some notes on the '81 Grammys"
01:47:41;01:47:45;"from our intern, our unofficial intern, Matt from Cambridge."
01:47:45;01:47:46;"Shout out to Matt from Cambridge."
01:47:46;01:47:47;"Matt's doing great work."
01:47:47;01:47:48;"He's been doing great work."
01:47:48;01:47:52;"So let's just paint a bit of a story about--"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"just so you can picture the '81 Grammys."
01:47:54;01:47:56;"They were hosted on February 25, '81,"
01:47:56;01:47:59;"for the first time ever in New York's iconic Radio City"
01:47:59;01:48:00;"musical."
01:48:00;01:48:02;"The Grammys are usually in LA."
01:48:02;01:48:04;"Every once in a while, they go to New York."
01:48:04;01:48:08;"Paul Simon hosted the proceedings with vintage Simon Witt"
01:48:08;01:48:09;"and charm."
01:48:09;01:48:11;"Isn't that funny to picture Paul Simon hosting the Grammys?"
01:48:11;01:48:12;"Wow."
01:48:12;01:48:14;"He opened the show slyly, telling the crowd"
01:48:14;01:48:16;"that his parents actually met at Radio City,"
01:48:16;01:48:19;"where they were both Rockettes."
01:48:19;01:48:20;"All right."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"Wait, what?"
01:48:21;01:48:24;"He was just making a goofy joke."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"He continued to say, ""I'm very happy to be here."
01:48:26;01:48:28;"It's not only a great honor to be asked,"
01:48:28;01:48:31;"but I think it's a very nice career move as well."""
01:48:31;01:48:32;"OK."
01:48:32;01:48:34;"Undeniably, the biggest story of the evening"
01:48:34;01:48:36;"was Christopher Cross."
01:48:36;01:48:39;"Cross became the only artist in the history of the event"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"to win each of the Big Four awards--"
01:48:41;01:48:44;"Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year,"
01:48:44;01:48:45;"and Best New Artist."
01:48:45;01:48:46;"Wow."
01:48:46;01:48:47;"So think about that."
01:48:47;01:48:50;"This year, we're talking about maybe Beyonce winning"
01:48:50;01:48:51;"Album of the Year."
01:48:51;01:48:54;"People debate a lot, like do the Grammys reflect true artistry"
01:48:54;01:48:55;"or whatever."
01:48:55;01:48:56;"It's imperfect."
01:48:56;01:48:59;"But if you look at generally who wins some of the big categories,"
01:48:59;01:49:02;"they tend to be respected artists, at least lately."
01:49:02;01:49:04;"Like, whatever."
01:49:04;01:49:10;"Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Beck, they're respected artists-ish."
01:49:10;01:49:11;"Yeah."
01:49:11;01:49:12;"Well, yeah."
01:49:12;01:49:13;"But I mean, whatever."
01:49:13;01:49:16;"Like, the Christopher Cross of our day would probably not be winning."
01:49:16;01:49:17;"Whatever."
01:49:17;01:49:18;"Yeah, I see what you're saying."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"His sweep winning all four of the big categories--"
01:49:20;01:49:21;"That's crazy."
01:49:21;01:49:22;"--started backlash."
01:49:22;01:49:26;"His record was undeniably popular, eventually going quintuple platinum."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"That's five times platinum."
01:49:28;01:49:31;"And he scored a bona fide hit in sailing."
01:49:31;01:49:34;"His meteoric rise from struggling, soft-spoken Texas songwriter"
01:49:34;01:49:37;"to the top of the charts made his story a fascination in the papers"
01:49:37;01:49:38;"in the following days."
01:49:38;01:49:40;"Because also sometimes with the Grammys, something's already a hit,"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"but then now truly everybody knows about it."
01:49:42;01:49:45;"So everybody's talking, who's Christopher Cross?"
01:49:45;01:49:48;"Grandma's asking, who's Christopher Cross?"
01:49:48;01:49:51;"Yet his success inspired the critics' ire."
01:49:51;01:49:55;"They pointed to the awarding of his self-proclaimed pop and roll."
01:49:55;01:49:57;"I guess he kind of played himself calling his music pop and roll."
01:49:57;01:50:00;"The critics aren't going to like that."
01:50:00;01:50:03;"So the critics pointed to it as the Academy's failure to recognize"
01:50:03;01:50:07;"artistically innovative and critically acclaimed pop music."
01:50:07;01:50:10;"Critics argued that it was commercial pandering,"
01:50:10;01:50:13;"an attempt on behalf of the Academy to generate momentum"
01:50:13;01:50:17;"for a new market segment, adult contemporary."
01:50:17;01:50:20;"So I guess you look at other stuff that came out in like 1980."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"I mean, what's happened in 1980?"
01:50:22;01:50:27;"Talking heads, ""Rain and Light,"" ""Clash,"" all sorts of like cool post-punk stuff."
01:50:27;01:50:30;"That stuff never is going to win, right?"
01:50:30;01:50:35;"Aren't the Grammys like sort of known as sort of by the industry,"
01:50:35;01:50:37;"for the industry?"
01:50:37;01:50:38;"Well--"
01:50:38;01:50:40;"I feel like we joked about this."
01:50:40;01:50:45;"It would be like if the Oscars was like, ""Best Picture, 'Transformers 4.'"""
01:50:45;01:50:46;"Well, not quite."
01:50:46;01:50:51;"I mean like the Grammys maybe has a weirder track record."
01:50:51;01:50:53;"I think the Grammys has a better track record than the Oscars."
01:50:53;01:50:55;"I was actually just talking about this with somebody."
01:50:55;01:51:01;"Like the Oscars is like such a narrow idea of what a great movie is."
01:51:01;01:51:05;"The Grammys mess up from time to time, but like in the '70s, for instance,"
01:51:05;01:51:07;"the decade just preceding this one."
01:51:07;01:51:10;"Like Stevie Wonder won like two or three times."
01:51:10;01:51:14;"So like you had like the--you know, in the '80s, like Paul Simon, ""Graceland,"""
01:51:14;01:51:15;"I think won."
01:51:15;01:51:16;"""Outcast"" has won."
01:51:16;01:51:19;"It's like the Grammys occasionally gets it like dead wrong,"
01:51:19;01:51:24;"but also sometimes they do find that nexus of like something that's"
01:51:24;01:51:26;"like legitimately the people love."
01:51:26;01:51:27;"That's sold a ton."
01:51:27;01:51:29;"But sold a ton, but it's also artists."
01:51:29;01:51:30;"I don't know."
01:51:30;01:51:32;"Well, that happens with the Oscars too."
01:51:32;01:51:34;"I mean it happens--you know, sometimes they're way off,"
01:51:34;01:51:35;"sometimes they're on the ball."
01:51:35;01:51:36;"I mean it happens."
01:51:36;01:51:39;"I just feel like the reputation of the Grammys is it's like more strictly"
01:51:39;01:51:43;"based on like commercial success is the first barometer."
01:51:43;01:51:45;"And it's actually an interesting thing to think about."
01:51:45;01:51:51;"And then the Oscars is more critical in its criteria,"
01:51:51;01:51:54;"and sometimes that can be way off."
01:51:54;01:52:00;"Right, because like the Oscars would never like give ""Step Brothers""--"
01:52:00;01:52:01;"No."
01:52:01;01:52:05;"--a nomination, even though most people think ""Step Brothers"" is a classic film."
01:52:05;01:52:07;"They don't even have a category to honor comedy."
01:52:07;01:52:10;"At least the Grammys--"
01:52:10;01:52:11;"There's not? That's crazy."
01:52:11;01:52:12;"No."
01:52:12;01:52:14;"No, it's whack."
01:52:14;01:52:17;"That's why comedy classically underperforms at the Oscars."
01:52:17;01:52:22;"At least the Grammys, you know, they have best alternative."
01:52:22;01:52:27;"It gives like a chance for like a ""Vampire Weekend"" to like get a Grammy."
01:52:27;01:52:29;"And they have rap categories and R&B categories."
01:52:29;01:52:34;"So at least the genre categories at least make it not impossible to win a Grammy"
01:52:34;01:52:37;"if you're not like some type of--a specific type of artist."
01:52:37;01:52:39;"And then even Album of the Year, like we'll see."
01:52:39;01:52:40;"We'll see who wins today."
01:52:40;01:52:42;"God, that's amazing about Christopher Cross though."
01:52:42;01:52:43;"That is just--"
01:52:43;01:52:44;"Clean sweep."
01:52:44;01:52:46;"Has that been done since?"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"Oh, that's a good question. I don't know."
01:52:48;01:52:54;"But just imagine all the critics just railing on poor Christopher Cross."
01:52:54;01:52:56;"That's really funny."
01:52:56;01:52:59;"And I mean then you go back and you listen to it and you're like,"
01:52:59;01:53:01;"yeah, it's funny how time works."
01:53:01;01:53:04;"Deep down, I love Talking Heads."
01:53:04;01:53:06;"I love Remain in Light."
01:53:06;01:53:11;"But like I would throw Once in a Lifetime next to Sailing on a mixtape."
01:53:11;01:53:13;"They're both cool."
01:53:13;01:53:17;"But back then it'd be like this sucks."
01:53:17;01:53:21;"This is garbage. This is the industry pandering."
01:53:21;01:53:24;"One thing I'll say, whether or not that's true,"
01:53:24;01:53:27;"I'm willing to believe that Christopher Cross put just as much thought,"
01:53:27;01:53:34;"heart and soul and artistry into Sailing as David Byrne put into Once in a Lifetime."
01:53:34;01:53:38;"That's a deep mystery."
01:53:38;01:53:39;"Maybe more."
01:53:39;01:53:42;"You're saying he's as sincere as David Byrne?"
01:53:42;01:53:47;"I'm just saying like the critics back then maybe were mad at the recording academy"
01:53:47;01:53:55;"and they were like you're just rewarding this gross thing to try to sell more records to aging consumers."
01:53:55;01:54:00;"But putting that aside, whatever crassness there might be within the industry,"
01:54:00;01:54:04;"in terms of artistry, I'm just saying that as a man,"
01:54:04;01:54:09;"Christopher Cross put just as much thought, soul, emotion into this song."
01:54:09;01:54:10;"Probably maybe even more."
01:54:10;01:54:11;"I would say more emotion."
01:54:11;01:54:14;"Yeah, well David Byrne's known to be not the most emotional guy."
01:54:14;01:54:17;"I would say less thought and more emotion."
01:54:17;01:54:24;"In fact, it was David Byrne's detachment that made him a more revered artist in the eyes of critics."
01:54:24;01:54:25;"Right."
01:54:25;01:54:26;"You know."
01:54:26;01:54:32;"Because David Byrne singing the lyric, ""The canvas can do miracles."""
01:54:32;01:54:36;"The canvas can do-- yeah, I mean."
01:54:36;01:54:40;"Anyway, Sailing, Song of the Year, 1981."
01:54:40;01:54:44;"We'll see who wins in 2017."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"Wow."
01:54:45;01:54:47;"We'll find out very soon."
01:54:47;01:54:49;"I'm liking this '81 vibe though."
01:54:49;01:54:50;"Yeah, '81's an interesting time."
01:54:50;01:54:53;"It's a transitional moment for the country."
01:54:53;01:54:54;"Yeah."
01:54:54;01:54:55;"Just like now."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"All right, well let's wrap things up, Jake."
01:54:57;01:54:58;"Yeah."
01:54:58;01:54:59;"That was a hell of a show, man."
01:54:59;01:55:00;"Yep, we got into it."
01:55:00;01:55:03;"We really started your 40s with a bang."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"We talked about life."
01:55:05;01:55:11;"We talked about bagels with the Berkowitz family of Freehold, New Jersey."
01:55:11;01:55:13;"We talked about the Grammys."
01:55:13;01:55:16;"We talked about training regimens."
01:55:16;01:55:18;"Yeah."
01:55:18;01:55:24;"Man, it was probably not a good idea to house a Flamin' Hot Cheetos bagel."
01:55:24;01:55:25;"How's that sitting?"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"The day of the Grammys."
01:55:27;01:55:28;"I liked it."
01:55:28;01:55:29;"It's fine."
01:55:29;01:55:36;"You're going to be launching some gross Flamin' Hot Cheetos burps at the Grammys."
01:55:36;01:55:38;"Yeah, maybe I should just stay home."
01:55:38;01:55:39;"You know what?"
01:55:39;01:55:42;"I'm going to go home, just do a real quick 10 push-ups."
01:55:42;01:55:43;"Nice, dude."
01:55:43;01:55:44;"Get pumped up."
01:55:44;01:55:45;"Get the blood flowing."
01:55:45;01:55:46;"That's right."
01:55:46;01:55:47;"I'll be good."
01:55:47;01:55:52;"As always, it's been nice to spend a couple hours on Sunday afternoon"
01:55:52;01:55:58;"taking a slight break from the horror show of the times we're living in."
01:55:58;01:56:02;"Oh, the canvas can do miracles."
01:56:02;01:56:05;"Yeah, I like sailing because there's this dark undertone to it"
01:56:05;01:56:09;"where it's kind of just like it's about fantasizing about just sailing,"
01:56:09;01:56:11;"you know, take me away."
01:56:11;01:56:12;"Right."
01:56:12;01:56:14;"But it's also like there's a darkness there."
01:56:14;01:56:16;"Yeah, that could cut either way."
01:56:16;01:56:20;"You know, it's like a haunting song."
01:56:20;01:56:23;"I love those arpeggios."
01:56:23;01:56:24;"See you later, Time Crisis listeners."
01:56:24;01:56:25;"We'll be back in two weeks."
01:56:25;01:56:27;"Time Crisis."
01:56:27;01:56:29;"On Beats 1."
