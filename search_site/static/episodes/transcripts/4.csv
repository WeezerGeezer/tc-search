03:19;03:21;"Welcome back to Time Crisis everybody."
03:21;03:25;"This is episode 4, still in Los Angeles."
03:25;03:27;"I haven't been able to get out."
03:27;03:31;"That means that Despot and Cousin Asher can't be with us but we're very lucky for the second"
03:31;03:37;"week in a row to have painter Jake Longstreth in the building."
03:37;03:38;"Nice to be back."
03:38;03:39;"We're very happy to have you back."
03:39;03:44;"We got an incredible response to you on the last show."
03:44;03:47;"You're teaching the youth all about Grateful Dead."
03:47;03:51;"We actually got a lot of kids on Twitter saying that stuff along the lines of like ""I'm young"
03:51;03:53;"and I don't think the Grateful Dead is trash."""
03:53;03:54;"Are you serious?"
03:54;03:55;"Yeah."
03:55;03:56;"Wow."
03:56;03:57;"I think the tide might be turning."
03:57;03:59;"So how many- I mean I thought that was all a contentious"
03:59;04:01;"stance you were taking to begin with, that they were trash."
04:01;04:04;"Or that you would perceive the youth to think that they were trash."
04:04;04:06;"But I mean that's what happens."
04:06;04:08;"It's just the cycle of culture."
04:08;04:10;"Your parents like something then the kids think it's trash."
04:10;04:13;"And then eventually the kids think it's cool."
04:13;04:16;"So what have you been up to the past two weeks?"
04:16;04:18;"Let's see here."
04:18;04:19;"I was in Vegas last weekend."
04:19;04:20;"Why were you in Vegas?"
04:20;04:24;"I was there for the Las Vegas Film Festival with my girlfriend."
04:24;04:29;"And we were staying in this hotel in the sort of old part of town."
04:29;04:32;"And across the street there was this place called the Heart Attack Grill."
04:32;04:34;"Have you heard of this?"
04:34;04:35;"No."
04:35;04:37;"It's a small chain apparently."
04:37;04:41;"And it's like a libertarian burger chain."
04:41;04:47;"And on the outside of the building in huge red neon it says ""Over 350 pounds eats for"
04:47;04:48;"free."""
04:48;04:51;"And there's a huge scale on the outside of the building."
04:51;04:57;"And there's a flat screen monitor mounted above the scale with this loop."
04:57;04:58;"This really sounds like you're making this up."
04:58;04:59;"No, no, no."
04:59;05:00;"I'm serious."
05:00;05:03;"This sounds like it's from like Idiocracy or like Tim and Eric."
05:03;05:04;"Yeah."
05:04;05:09;"Wait, but what makes it, is there a connection between libertarianism and being overweight?"
05:09;05:11;"No, no, no."
05:11;05:12;"Well here's the thing."
05:12;05:16;"So all over the outside of this building there were quotes from the founder of the restaurant."
05:16;05:17;"Right."
05:17;05:21;"He said, ""We don't want every town in this country to turn into another San Francisco."
05:21;05:26;"Nowhere in the Constitution does it say that the caloric intake of adults should be regulated"
05:26;05:28;"and mandated by the government."
05:28;05:34;"This food is unabashedly terrible for you and it's dangerous for you."""
05:34;05:35;"Oh, okay."
05:35;05:37;"""But we have the freedom to eat this food."""
05:37;05:40;"The staff of the restaurant wears medical scrubs."
05:40;05:41;"Yeah."
05:41;05:42;"Oh, because it's the Heart Attack Grill?"
05:42;05:43;"Yeah."
05:43;05:48;"So a customer there, you put on this bib that's actually just sort of like a hospital gown."
05:48;05:50;"Wow, I have such mixed feelings about all of this."
05:50;05:55;"It was, no, so we walked past this place like five times in like 115 degree heat."
05:55;05:57;"It was just like, it was dark."
05:57;06:02;"I mean, I think it's kind of cool that they maybe are not like body shaming people."
06:02;06:03;"Absolutely."
06:03;06:08;"But at the same time, you shouldn't use other people's bodies for your own political agenda."
06:08;06:09;"Totally true."
06:09;06:16;"I, yeah, I mean, there's a part of me that could, that can understand the philosophy,"
06:16;06:21;"but it's just so grotesque that my delicate sensibilities were, I'm not going to say offended,"
06:21;06:23;"but I was depressed."
06:23;06:24;"Yeah."
06:24;06:27;"Well, Heart Attack Grill, check it out next time you're in Vegas."
06:27;06:28;"Here's Chicago with If You Leave Me Now."
06:28;06:35;"If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me."
06:35;06:39;"Ooh, no, baby, please don't go."
06:39;06:48;"And if you leave me now, you'll take away the best part of me."
06:48;06:54;"Ooh, no, baby, please don't go."
06:54;07:02;"And if you leave me now, you'll take away the very heart of me."
07:02;07:08;"Ooh, no, baby, please don't go."
07:08;07:14;"Ooh, God, I just want you to stay."
07:19;07:25;"Love like ours is love that's hard to find."
07:25;07:32;"How could we let it slip away?"
07:32;07:43;"We've come too far to leave it all behind."
07:46;07:50;"How could we end it all this way?"
07:50;07:56;"When tomorrow comes and we both regret it,"
07:56;08:00;"it feels the same to me."
08:00;08:03;"[MUSIC - THE BEATLES, ""LOVE LIKE OURS""]"
08:27;08:33;"Love like ours is love that's hard to find."
08:33;08:40;"How could we let it slip away?"
08:40;08:52;"We've come too far to leave it all behind."
08:54;08:59;"How could we end it all this way?"
08:59;09:07;"When tomorrow comes and we both regret the things we said today?"
09:07;09:17;"And if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me."
09:20;09:25;"Ooh, no, baby, please don't go."
09:25;09:40;"Ooh, God, what's got to get me by my side?"
09:47;09:52;"Ooh, no, baby, please don't go."
09:52;10:07;"Ooh, mama, I just got to have your love today."
10:14;10:17;"[MUSIC - THE BEATLES, ""I WAS DREAMING OF THE PAST""]"
10:17;10:34;"I was dreaming of the past."
10:34;10:41;"And my heart was beating fast."
10:42;10:46;"I began to lose control."
10:46;10:54;"I began to lose control."
10:54;11:04;"I didn't mean to hurt you, no, no."
11:06;11:11;"And I'm sorry I made you cry."
11:11;11:19;"I didn't want to hurt you."
11:19;11:20;"No, I didn't."
11:20;11:25;"I'm just a jealous guy."
11:25;11:33;"Now, I was feeling insecure."
11:34;11:38;"You might not want me anymore."
11:38;11:46;"I was trembling inside."
11:59;12:05;"I didn't mean to hurt you, no, no."
12:05;12:12;"And I'm sorry I made you cry."
12:12;12:21;"I didn't want to hurt you, no, no."
12:21;12:27;"I'm just a jealous guy."
12:27;12:29;"I'm just a jealous guy."
12:30;12:33;"I'm just a jealous guy."
12:33;12:36;"[MUSIC - THE BEATLES, ""I WAS DREAMING OF THE PAST""]"
13:01;13:08;"I didn't mean to hurt you, no, no."
13:08;13:15;"And I'm sorry I made you cry."
13:15;13:25;"Oh, I didn't want to hurt you, no, no."
13:25;13:29;"I'm just a jealous guy."
13:29;13:34;"I'm just a jealous guy."
13:34;13:38;"I'm just a jealous guy."
13:38;13:41;"Yes, I am."
13:41;13:45;"I'm just a jealous guy, yeah."
13:45;13:52;"And I wasn't gonna fight it, looking at you."
13:52;13:56;"'Cause I'm a jealous kind of fella."
14:00;14:01;"Yeah."
14:01;14:04;"[MUSIC - THE BEATLES, ""I WAS DREAMING OF THE PAST""]"
14:34;14:37;"Yeah, I'm a jealous guy."
14:37;14:38;"Yes, I am."
14:38;14:47;"Yeah."
14:47;15:03;"[APPLAUSE]"
15:04;15:12;"You're listening to Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig on Beats 1."
15:12;15:15;"That was Donny Hathaway covering John Lennon's Jealous Guy,"
15:15;15:17;"live at the Bitter End, 1971."
15:17;15:18;"You familiar with that cover, Jake?"
15:18;15:19;"Yeah, I love that."
15:19;15:20;"It's beautiful."
15:20;15:24;"And so that-- is that like the same year that the original song"
15:24;15:25;"came out?"
15:25;15:29;"I think more or less, yeah, at most a year later."
15:29;15:31;"I love when people do that."
15:31;15:33;"And I feel like that was a more common thing back then,"
15:33;15:36;"to just turn around, like hear a new song,"
15:36;15:38;"and then turn around and completely reinterpret it."
15:38;15:39;"Well, you'd be surprised."
15:39;15:42;"A lot of people are doing that on YouTube these days."
15:42;15:44;"And Vine."
15:44;15:46;"I mean, like fans, like amateur hour?"
15:46;15:48;"Or are we talking about like prominent artists?"
15:48;15:51;"Yeah."
15:51;15:54;"You definitely have a lot of fans who like the day a song comes out"
15:54;15:58;"will be like the first person doing the acoustic cover on YouTube."
15:58;16:01;"But you also have-- I don't know."
16:01;16:04;"I feel like there's also-- because there's such a hunger for content"
16:04;16:08;"in the modern digital global marketplace,"
16:08;16:10;"that you will have more covers."
16:10;16:13;"I feel like in Vampire Weekend we're always asked to do covers."
16:13;16:16;"You ever heard the Jimi Hendrix playing Sgt. Pepper?"
16:16;16:17;"Yeah, oh yeah."
16:17;16:19;"And that was like the week that album came out."
16:19;16:20;"Exactly."
16:20;16:21;"That's the lore."
16:21;16:25;"Right, so Hendrix was just like playing a show in London."
16:25;16:28;"This album drops, and he's just like, I'm just going to cover this song."
16:28;16:30;"Yeah, like the next day."
16:30;16:34;"I think I read that Taylor Swift covered ""Trap Queen."""
16:34;16:35;"What's that song?"
16:35;16:40;"""Trap Queen"" is a gargantuan hit this year."
16:40;16:42;"New Jersey rapper Fetty Wap."
16:42;16:45;"She either brought him out on stage or they covered the song together."
16:45;16:46;"I don't know."
16:46;16:47;"Covered?"
16:47;16:49;"Maybe she just watched him sing it."
16:49;16:51;"And did she sing the hook or something?"
16:51;16:52;"You know, that's unclear."
16:52;16:55;"Maybe she brought him out and he sang it and she watched him sing it."
16:55;17:01;"I still think there's a distinction from what we're talking about with kids doing covers on YouTube"
17:01;17:04;"and then that cover we just heard of Jealous Guy."
17:04;17:06;"Yeah, I know what you mean."
17:06;17:09;"I was thinking, I was kind of putting a playlist together for today,"
17:09;17:14;"and I was thinking that I was going to keep it a little bit rock,"
17:14;17:17;"because later you're going to teach us about the Eagles."
17:17;17:20;"So I was keeping it more on that 60s, 70s tip."
17:20;17:22;"I was actually thinking about Jimi Hendrix,"
17:22;17:27;"because sometimes it feels like the modern world doesn't really care about Jimi Hendrix."
17:27;17:30;"He's almost like Che Guevara."
17:30;17:32;"You know what I mean?"
17:32;17:33;"Like dorm room posters?"
17:33;17:36;"Like the same way that Che Guevara has just become a dorm room poster,"
17:36;17:42;"and a lot of people are more familiar with the poster than say with his politics."
17:42;17:44;"I think there's a similar disconnect with Hendrix and the music."
17:44;17:46;"I think you're right."
17:46;17:50;"Hendrix, I mean, I guess from my vantage point,"
17:50;17:55;"Hendrix, his main thing was what an incredible guitar player he was."
17:55;18:00;"And he wrote some amazing songs, but I don't think of him primarily as a terrific songwriter."
18:00;18:06;"And maybe with the guitar being sort of out of fashion, or out of favor, or just very hard to do."
18:06;18:08;"Yeah, no, it's out of fashion."
18:08;18:11;"Okay, confirmed. It's out of fashion."
18:11;18:13;"But his image is like so cool."
18:13;18:16;"Of course, because he's had an amazing style."
18:16;18:18;"He was a born performer."
18:18;18:20;"And he did write some good songs."
18:20;18:22;"I was going to play ""Bold is Love."""
18:22;18:26;"Let's see what the world thinks of Jimi Hendrix in 2015, ""Bold is Love."""
18:26;18:32;"Anger, he smiles, towering in shiny metallic purple armor."
18:32;18:36;"Queen jealousy, envy waits behind him."
18:36;18:41;"Her fiery green gown slayers at the grassy ground."
18:41;18:47;"Blue are the life-giving waters, take 'em for granted, they quietly understand."
18:47;18:55;"Once happy, turquoise armies lay opposite ready, but wonder why the fight is on."
18:55;19:00;"But they're all bold as love."
19:00;19:06;"They're all bold as love."
19:12;19:16;"Just ask the answers."
19:20;19:28;"My red is so confident he flashes trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria."
19:28;19:34;"Orange is young, full of daring, but very unsteady for the first go 'round."
19:34;19:37;"My yellow in this case is not so mellow."
19:37;19:41;"In fact, I'm trying to say it's frightened like me."
19:41;19:48;"And all of these emotions in mind keep tolling me from giving my life to a rainbow like you."
19:48;19:53;"But I'm a, yeah, I'm bold as love."
19:53;19:56;"Yeah, yeah."
19:56;20:01;"Well, I'm bold, bold as love."
20:01;20:07;"Let me tell you, I'm bold as love."
20:07;20:11;"Just ask the answers."
20:11;20:14;"He knows everything."
20:14;20:17;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."

25:12;25:14;"That was the album from the 60s."
25:14;25:16;"There's like a bunch of gospel covers of Dylan."
25:16;25:17;"You ever heard that?"
25:17;25:18;"- A little bit, I love that."
25:18;25:20;"- Yes, I-- - It's incredible."
25:20;25:22;"- Yeah, it really gives the song,"
25:22;25:24;"it makes the original not sound that good."
25:24;25:25;"- To me, it sort of is like,"
25:25;25:30;"it exposes how strong the foundation of that songwriting is"
25:31;25:34;"that you could translate his song into that"
25:34;25:38;"and it sound like some just complete classic"
25:38;25:42;"from before the rock and roll era."
25:42;25:43;"- Right."
25:43;25:45;"You knew what he was doing."
25:45;25:47;"- Bob."
25:47;25:48;"- Bob, yeah."
25:48;25:52;"It's very exciting 'cause today we have Jamie Foxx"
25:52;25:53;"coming in to do the top five with us."
25:53;25:55;"Are you familiar with Jamie Foxx?"
25:55;25:56;"- Yeah."
25:56;25:58;"- Are you familiar with his music?"
25:58;25:59;"- No."
25:59;26:00;"He's on a Kanye song, right?"
26:00;26:01;"On the first record?"
26:01;26:02;"- Yeah, he's on Slow Jam,"
26:02;26:04;"he's on the first and the second."
26:04;26:05;"He's on Slow Jams on the first"
26:05;26:06;"and Gold Digger on the second."
26:06;26:07;"- Oh, that's him?"
26:07;26:09;"- Yeah, yeah, he's doing like kind of the Ray Charles."
26:09;26:10;"- That's cool."
26:10;26:12;"- Yeah, we're very excited to have him."
26:12;26:16;"I was thinking today that he's a true triple threat in 2015,"
26:16;26:18;"which used to be more common, I think, in showbiz,"
26:18;26:20;"but he's like massive standup comedian."
26:20;26:21;"I don't think he's like gone on tour."
26:21;26:22;"- Still?"
26:22;26:23;"Okay."
26:23;26:24;"- No, I mean, he could."
26:24;26:25;"- Back in the day."
26:25;26:26;"- Not even that long ago."
26:26;26:28;"I think he's done, within the past like five years,"
26:28;26:30;"he's done like massive arena standup tours."
26:30;26:31;"- Wow."
26:31;26:34;"- Obviously, huge actor, Academy Award winning actor,"
26:34;26:36;"and then like a legitimately huge musician, too."
26:36;26:37;"- That's insane."
26:37;26:40;"That's like Sinatra, but Sinatra couldn't do comedy."
26:40;26:41;"- Standup."
26:41;26:46;"- Woe to them that are at ease in Zion."
26:46;26:47;"- Actually, have you ever--"
26:47;26:48;"- That seems kind of unprecedented, actually."
26:48;26:49;"- Yeah, standup."
26:49;26:50;"- Maybe Steve Martin?"
26:50;26:51;"- Yeah."
26:51;26:56;"The previous Triple Crown title holder was Steve Martin,"
26:56;26:58;"and then Jamie Foxx came in and just shit all over him."
26:58;27:00;"- But see, yeah, Steve Martin's music sucks."
27:00;27:01;"(laughing)"
27:01;27:03;"It's like novelty music."
27:03;27:06;"- Well, yeah, I mean, he can actually shred on banjo."
27:06;27:08;"- Yeah, okay, fair."
27:08;27:10;"He's a practitioner, for sure."
27:10;27:11;"- He's a practitioner."
27:11;27:14;"Although banjo is like obviously a little bit like guitar."
27:14;27:15;"It's like you get these dudes who just kind of like"
27:15;27:17;"learn how to shred on it."
27:17;27:21;"You know, doesn't exactly have that kind of forward thinking."
27:21;27:23;"You're not gonna get a number one pop hit."
27:23;27:25;"- So is Jamie Foxx writing songs?"
27:25;27:27;"- I think he writes, yeah."
27:27;27:30;"I mean, I'm sure he like collaborates with people,"
27:30;27:31;"'cause he's worked with so many different producers"
27:31;27:33;"and stuff, but he's definitely a writer."
27:33;27:37;"He plays piano, studied classical music,"
27:37;27:40;"I was reading today, in college."
27:40;27:44;"And then as I said, his career's been from ""In Living Color"""
27:44;27:46;"to the Jamie Foxx show, ""Booty Call,"""
27:46;27:49;"which my dad was a set dresser on."
27:49;27:50;"- That was a show he had?"
27:50;27:51;"- It was a film."
27:51;27:52;"- Oh, okay."
27:52;27:53;"- Oh, you never saw ""Booty Call?"""
27:53;27:54;"- No."
27:54;27:56;"- That's a real classic, it's him and Tommy Davidson."
27:56;27:59;"Then all like the huge movies of the past 15 years"
27:59;28:00;"and Ray and stuff."
28:00;28:00;"- Oh, incredible."
28:00;28:01;"- Yeah, incredible."
28:01;28:04;"So we're very blessed to have him in the studio."
28:04;28:06;"But before he gets here, I wanna play some of his music."
28:06;28:09;"My personal favorite, he's done a lot of music,"
28:09;28:13;"my personal favorite Jamie Foxx song is ""Extravaganza."""
28:13;28:15;"I believe this was on his first album,"
28:15;28:17;"and I love this, I love the lyrics to it."
28:17;28:18;"It's all about one crazy night,"
28:18;28:19;"and basically the hook is,"

32:38;32:40;"We're very excited because Jamie's gonna be"
32:40;32:43;"in the studio with us in person a little bit later"
32:43;32:45;"to count down the iTunes Top 5."
32:45;32:50;"But before that happens, we're gonna get into some Eagles."
32:50;32:53;"Jake, are you ready to do our little Eagles rundown?"
32:53;32:54;"- Sure, let's get into it."
32:54;32:55;"- Let's get into it."
32:55;32:58;"So I think the first question is,"
32:58;33:01;"for a lot of the younger people listening,"
33:01;33:04;"who are the Eagles and why are they important, if at all?"
33:04;33:06;"- Well, okay, the Eagles are one of the biggest"
33:06;33:08;"selling artists of all time."
33:08;33:12;"And their greatest hits, Volume 1, is, I think,"
33:12;33:16;"tied with Thriller for the greatest selling album of all time."
33:16;33:17;"- Tied with Thriller?"
33:17;33:18;"- Yeah. - Okay."
33:18;33:24;"- They were a rock and roll band formed in 1970, '71,"
33:24;33:26;"in Los Angeles. - Okay."
33:26;33:29;"- And they disbanded in about 1980, and they sort of,"
33:29;33:31;"I think in a lot of people's minds,"
33:31;33:34;"symbolize and embody the 1970s."
33:34;33:37;"I mean, they all met playing in Linda Ronstadt's band."
33:37;33:38;"- Right."
33:38;33:40;"- Playing gigs at the Troubadour in the late '60s."
33:40;33:45;"So they emerge out of that late '60s Laurel Canyon hippie scene."
33:45;33:47;"Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell,"
33:47;33:50;"all those really idiosyncratic great artists."
33:50;33:53;"And the Eagles kind of go and write the more sort of"
33:53;33:58;"straightforward commercial versions of their peers."
33:58;34:01;"- Which at the time, it made them a punchline a little bit."
34:01;34:02;"- Yeah, I mean--"
34:02;34:05;"- Like in the movie Big Lebowski, the dude hates the Eagles."
34:05;34:06;"- Right, absolutely."
34:06;34:09;"- I feel like there was like a Seinfeld where there was"
34:09;34:12;"some kind of joke about Desperado."
34:12;34:13;"- Oh, you know, witchy woman."
34:13;34:14;"- Oh, witchy woman."
34:14;34:15;"- Yeah, yeah."
34:15;34:17;"- They like hated hearing it on the radio or something."
34:17;34:18;"- They're a punchline."
34:18;34:19;"Well, this is what's interesting."
34:19;34:20;"So if you think about--"
34:20;34:21;"- For snarky New York intellectuals."
34:21;34:22;"- Right."
34:22;34:23;"- The Eagles had a bullseye."
34:23;34:26;"- For the tastemakers, the Eagles have always been a joke."
34:26;34:27;"- Right."
34:27;34:30;"- And I think it's interesting to think about the other"
34:30;34:34;"really big top-selling artists, Beatles, Stones, Zeppelin,"
34:34;34:39;"Michael Jackson, those artists are not hated in the same way"
34:39;34:40;"that the Eagles are."
34:40;34:43;"I mean, people might be indifferent to the Beatles"
34:43;34:46;"or love Zeppelin, but they're not like, ""The Beatles suck."
34:46;34:47;"""I hate the Beatles."""
34:47;34:50;"And I think the Eagles represent some sort of like"
34:50;34:56;"very middle-brow, vanilla, corporate vision of rock and roll."
34:56;34:59;"Now, I don't actually think that's the case."
34:59;35:01;"I'm here to make a case for the Eagles."
35:01;35:02;"- Right, yes, let's--"
35:02;35:05;"- I like the Eagles, but I think that it's--"
35:05;35:07;"to me, they're a fascinating band to think about"
35:07;35:10;"because they are so loved and so hated and so mild."
35:10;35:11;"- Right."
35:11;35:12;"So let's picture this."
35:12;35:14;"I'm a college senior right now."
35:14;35:16;"I'm 22 years old."
35:16;35:19;"To me, the Eagles represent vanilla garbage."
35:19;35:21;"What's the first song you're going to play to me"
35:21;35:23;"to show that that's not the case?"
35:23;35:29;"- Let's start with ""My Man,"" which is a song from '74"
35:29;35:32;"written by Bernie Leden to his friend, Graham Parsons,"
35:32;35:36;"who had just died the year prior from a drug overdose."
35:36;35:39;"They wrote this very, very touching, very beautiful,"
35:39;35:42;"but very saccharine song."
35:42;35:43;"- Okay."
35:43;35:45;"- But I actually like the song."
35:45;35:46;"I mean, it's very affecting, but--"
35:46;35:50;"- So this is the Eagles' tribute to Graham Parsons' ""My Man."""

39:13;39:16;"The first song in Jake Longstreet's defense"
39:16;39:17;"of the Eagles."
39:17;39:19;"That's a pretty good song."
39:19;39:20;"Yeah."
39:20;39:22;"I don't know if that's gonna convert the haters."
39:22;39:23;"No, probably not."
39:23;39:27;"I mean, my defense is somewhat ambivalent."
39:27;39:29;"I like the Eagles."
39:29;39:31;"I mean, I would even say I'm a fan of the Eagles."
39:31;39:32;"Yeah."
39:32;39:35;"But I definitely see why people don't like them"
39:35;39:37;"and they're reviled, and that's fascinating to me."
39:37;39:38;"Right."
39:38;39:40;"Well, I feel like the Eagles were essentially"
39:40;39:42;"like the pop music of the day in a way."
39:42;39:43;"Yeah, yeah."
39:43;39:46;"And I feel like there's a lot of times that"
39:46;39:50;"there's an argument to be made that is kind of just like--"
39:50;39:52;"it's almost like a kind of nihilistic"
39:52;39:54;"or pessimistic view of the world."
39:54;39:56;"It's kind of like, yeah, you know what?"
39:56;39:59;"You hate on pop music because it's simple or something"
39:59;40:01;"and you think it's trash, but you know what?"
40:01;40:02;"Like, everything's trash."
40:02;40:04;"I'm just saying that you might say--"
40:04;40:06;"like, who's to say that the Beatles or Zeppelin"
40:06;40:08;"is better than the Eagles?"
40:08;40:11;"Yeah, I mean, there's no way to qualitatively prove"
40:11;40:14;"that the Eagles are lame and Led Zeppelin's awesome."
40:14;40:16;"Well, and also, as time goes by,"
40:16;40:19;"I bet there probably are a lot more young people"
40:19;40:20;"putting on the Eagles."
40:20;40:22;"They're not putting on the Sex Pistols."
40:22;40:23;"Oh, hell no."
40:23;40:25;"They're probably not putting on the Ramones."
40:25;40:26;"Yeah."
40:26;40:29;"They're probably not putting on..."
40:29;40:30;"Buzzcocks."
40:30;40:32;"Buzzcocks."
40:32;40:34;"I mean, I'm just saying a lot of the music of the late '70s"
40:34;40:36;"that was considered so fresh and cool--"
40:36;40:37;"Right."
40:37;40:38;"--punk rock, whatever--"
40:38;40:39;"Right."
40:39;40:42;"--that probably seemed like an antidote to the Eagles."
40:42;40:43;"Yeah, yeah."
40:43;40:44;"I don't know."
40:44;40:46;"I don't think the youth are particularly preferring"
40:46;40:47;"punk rock to the Eagles."
40:47;40:48;"I see what you're saying."
40:48;40:50;"I mean, yeah, maybe today we're in sort of like"
40:50;40:51;"a post-ideological place--"
40:51;40:52;"Yeah."
40:52;40:53;"--where it's all just sort of available."
40:53;40:54;"Right."
40:54;40:56;"I mean, it's a common talking point these days,"
40:56;40:58;"and I think there's some truth to it."
40:58;41:00;"Well, look, if there are any young people listening,"
41:00;41:03;"anybody under the age of 25,"
41:03;41:08;"tweet @JakeLongstreth your opinion on the Eagles,"
41:08;41:10;"and we'll read it to ourselves--"
41:10;41:11;"That's on Twitter."
41:11;41:12;"--when this airs."
41:12;41:13;"What's your--"
41:13;41:14;"Dongstreth."
41:14;41:15;"Oh, tweet @Dongstreth--"
41:15;41:19;"that's D-O-N-G-S-T-R-E-T-H--"
41:19;41:21;"and let him know how you feel about the Eagles,"
41:21;41:24;"and we want to have some feedback on the program."
41:24;41:26;"So let's get into another Eagles song, Jake."
41:26;41:28;"What's another song you might pick that maybe people"
41:28;41:30;"haven't heard that kind of--"
41:30;41:32;"to make a case for these guys?"
41:32;41:36;"Let's do ""Dulin Dalton."""
41:36;41:37;"""Dulin Dalton."""
41:37;41:38;"That's another one."
41:38;41:39;"That's a funny name."
41:39;41:42;"Yeah, that's the first track on the Desperado album."
41:42;41:44;"I assume this is about the Upper East Side"
41:44;41:46;"private school Dalton School in New York."
41:46;41:48;"You would be wrong."
41:48;41:49;"Oh."
41:49;41:54;"It's the first song on a concept album called ""Desperado,"""
41:54;41:58;"which was sort of a half-baked concept album"
41:58;42:00;"about the Old West,"
42:00;42:04;"and it's Bill Dalton meets Bill Dulin."
42:04;42:05;"Okay."
42:05;42:06;"And they duel."
42:06;42:07;"Two guys named Bill."
42:07;42:08;"Yeah."
42:08;42:09;"Okay, so let's get into this."

45:37;45:38;"It's a name."
45:38;45:40;"So I guess that's a play on words."
45:40;45:41;"Dulin Dalton."
45:41;45:44;"Like, the cover of that record is them dressed up as cowboys."
45:44;45:45;"Right."
45:45;45:49;"It's like a kitschy exploration of themes of the Old West."
45:49;45:51;"So that was on Desperado."
45:51;45:53;"Yeah, and I feel like Henley kind of hits his peak"
45:53;45:55;"with the Hotel California album."
45:55;45:57;"I think that's the album that most people are familiar with."
45:57;45:58;"Yeah."
45:58;46:00;"Hotel California's probably their most famous song."
46:00;46:01;"It's like their signature song."
46:01;46:02;"Yeah."
46:02;46:04;"Not a song that I want to hear a lot of,"
46:04;46:07;"maybe because I've heard it so much."
46:07;46:09;"But lyrically, that song is incredible."
46:09;46:10;"It's dark."
46:10;46:11;"Right."
46:11;46:13;"Well, yeah, it's the first song on the Hotel California record."
46:13;46:16;"And it's like--it follows--it's a little ambiguous,"
46:16;46:19;"but it follows the journey of this guy"
46:19;46:21;"driving down a desert highway at night,"
46:21;46:24;"smelling the desert flowers,"
46:24;46:26;"and he sees this, you know, off in the distance,"
46:26;46:27;"a shimmering light."
46:27;46:29;"Which is L.A., you think?"
46:29;46:30;"Yeah."
46:30;46:32;"And Hotel California is a--"
46:32;46:34;"you know, he checks into the Hotel California."
46:34;46:35;"Right."
46:35;46:38;"And it's obviously a metaphor for him coming to L.A."
46:38;46:40;"with a sense of ambition and dreams."
46:40;46:41;"Yeah."
46:41;46:43;"And then as the album progresses,"
46:43;46:45;"he becomes the new kid in town."
46:45;46:48;"You know, talk on the street sounds so familiar."
46:48;46:50;"And then he gets into life in the fast lane."
46:50;46:51;"Okay."
46:51;46:53;"And he loses himself."
46:53;46:58;"And so through his desire to achieve the fame"
46:58;46:59;"and the American dream,"
46:59;47:01;"he becomes disillusioned throughout the record."
47:01;47:02;"It's very Faustian."
47:02;47:03;"Yeah."
47:03;47:05;"Be careful what you wish for."
47:05;47:08;"I mean, the funny part to me is that the Eagles did achieve--"
47:08;47:09;"Right."
47:09;47:12;"--this story that they're sort of satirizing."
47:12;47:14;"Yeah, I always find that funny as an artist."
47:14;47:16;"I think about that sometimes myself,"
47:16;47:20;"is like that so many artists--"
47:20;47:21;"like, here's an example."
47:21;47:24;"Like, remember, second or third album, Britney Spears,"
47:24;47:27;"she had this song called ""Lucky"" that went--"
47:27;47:30;"the video was all about her being like an old-school Hollywood starlet"
47:30;47:32;"who's, like, depressed in her room,"
47:32;47:33;"which probably was true because--"
47:33;47:34;"Sure."
47:34;47:38;"--a lot of people who achieve success in this miserable, you know,"
47:38;47:43;"late capitalist hell suffer from depression and anxiety."
47:43;47:44;"But there's something funny about that."
47:44;47:49;"You get those messages in the form of albums and movies."
47:49;47:50;"Right."
47:50;47:53;"Like, the rich, successful artists are the ones telling you this"
47:53;47:56;"cautionary tale about becoming a rich, successful artist."
47:56;47:59;"So it's almost like it's an American tradition to, like,"
47:59;48:03;"get rich and successful and then just kind of, like--"
48:03;48:04;"Distance-- yeah, like--"
48:04;48:05;"Yeah."
48:05;48:08;"--distance yourself or satirize it and say how miserable I am."
48:08;48:09;"I mean--"
48:09;48:10;"Like, what are you supposed to take away from that?"
48:10;48:12;"Like, don't be like the Eagles?"
48:12;48:13;"Well, I think-- no."
48:13;48:16;"I think what you're supposed to take away is that it's a sad--"
48:16;48:19;"I think you could apply it to kind of anyone's life."
48:19;48:22;"It's the sad underbelly of the American dream."
48:22;48:25;"I think everyone is sort of striving."
48:25;48:28;"I think in this case for material wealth."
48:28;48:29;"Yeah."
48:29;48:33;"And I think that album explores, like, that is going to be an empty pursuit."
48:33;48:36;"And I should also point out that I've been thinking about this a lot too,"
48:36;48:41;"is that a lot of times we talk about the idea that the American obsession"
48:41;48:44;"with wealth and success is what's so empty."
48:44;48:47;"But then I was thinking, you know, people in a lot of religions,"
48:47;48:49;"people have been saying, you know, like in Buddhism,"
48:49;48:51;"that desire is the root of all suffering."
48:51;48:54;"They were saying that pre-capitalism thousands of years ago."
48:54;48:57;"So in some ways it's like an eternal theme beyond money."
48:57;49:02;"Just the idea that pursuing desires and achieving them,"
49:02;49:05;"there's something fundamentally sad about that in the human experience."
49:05;49:07;"What's the next thing?"
49:07;49:12;"I've heard it described this way, that desire is a moving target."
49:12;49:15;"So you achieve it and it keeps moving further."
49:15;49:19;"So there's no such thing as truly achieving peace until whatever,"
49:19;49:21;"you destroy your ego or something."
49:21;49:24;"That explains the enduring power of Hotel California."
49:24;49:25;"Yes."
49:25;49:29;"But you don't want to listen to Hotel California because you're trying to stay away from the hits."
49:29;49:32;"Like I said, I think it's kind of messed up and perverse to come into your show"
49:32;49:34;"and play Hotel California."
49:34;49:35;"Yeah."
49:35;49:38;"I think my favorite song off that album is called ""Try and Love Again,"""
49:38;49:43;"which is towards the end of the album it's written and sung by Randy Meisner."
49:43;49:46;"Why is that name so funny?"
49:46;49:47;"It's a great name."
49:47;49:49;"Randy is just a great name."
49:49;49:52;"And so it's sort of towards the end of the album and he is just like--"
49:52;49:56;"this character has just been to the ringer and he's just going to try and love again."
49:56;49:59;"He's just like down at the bottom, he's going to try to start his ascent back up."
49:59;50:05;"And that's interesting because a lot of people would say that one of the things"
50:05;50:11;"that allows us to get through the cycle of desire and dissatisfaction or whatever is love."
50:11;50:12;"Absolutely."
50:12;50:16;"So to try and love again, I could imagine that being a nice ending to this saga."
50:16;50:22;"So here's The Eagles featuring Randy Meisner on lead vocals with ""Try and Love Again."""

55:25;55:27;"I think that is a beautiful song"
55:27;55:29;"I think that might be my favorite of the three that you played"
55:29;55:31;"I think so too"
55:31;55:34;"Well we really appreciate you coming through and making a case for ""The Eagles"""
55:34;55:38;"Unlike ""The Dead"" the youth don't really hate them, they're just kind of indifferent"

55:42;55:45;"about why they should give ""The Eagles"" a chance"
55:45;55:47;"You want to just kind of wrap it up?"
55:47;55:50;"Well yeah, ""The Eagles"" don't need me to go to bat for them"
55:50;55:54;"But I think with ""The Eagles"" there is sort of like"
55:54;55:56;"If you dig deep and actually listen to the lyrics"
55:56;56:03;"There are some surprisingly dark and satirical and funny aspects to their music"
56:03;56:10;"On the surface it's very kind of borderline generic palatable country rock"
56:10;56:13;"But when you actually get into it there's a whole"
56:13;56:21;"Especially with Henley, his lyrics are all about the ideals of the 60's not working out"
56:21;56:26;"As you follow Don Henley's solo career into the 80's"
56:26;56:28;"He had that song ""Boys of Summer"""
56:28;56:29;"Beautiful song"
56:29;56:34;"With that iconic lyric ""Out on the road today, saw a deadhead sticker on a Cadillac"""
56:34;56:38;"So there's an old guy driving some old guy car with a deadhead sticker"
56:38;56:43;"And sort of coming to terms with the spirit of the 60's and his youth"
56:43;56:47;"And that kind of going into Reagan era capitalism"
56:47;56:49;"And I feel like that is the drive"
56:49;56:52;"To me that's the compelling narrative in ""The Eagles"""
56:52;56:55;"It's just kind of watching things change and fall apart"
56:55;56:56;"Right"
56:56;57:00;"And that's maybe why there's a bit of melancholy running through"
57:00;57:01;"Yeah"

01:02:09;01:02:10;"Hello"
01:02:10;01:02:14;"But a lot of you might know him better as ""Electro Lemon"" from Twitter"
01:02:14;01:02:15;"Yeah"
01:02:15;01:02:16;"That's your Twitter handle"
01:02:16;01:02:17;"Yeah, it is"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"Am I pronouncing ""Electro Lemon"" correctly?"
01:02:19;01:02:27;"Perfectly, although, I mean, there's not really any real pronunciation of anything that I would say I created online, you know"
01:02:27;01:02:30;"It's like when people say there's ""gif"" and ""jif"" I think it doesn't matter"
01:02:30;01:02:31;"Because it's just text"
01:02:31;01:02:32;"Right"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"Because maybe some people think it's ""Electro Lemon"""
01:02:34;01:02:36;"Some people do, people have said that to me"
01:02:36;01:02:37;"Like King Solomon"
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Yeah"
01:02:38;01:02:42;"So, I first knew you through Twitter, you're not a full-time tweeter"
01:02:42;01:02:43;"No"
01:02:43;01:02:44;"What else do you do?"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"I work on a TV show called ""At Midnight"""
01:02:46;01:02:52;"I'm a digital producer over there, I work on social videos for their online stuff and sometimes for the show"
01:02:52;01:02:56;"And then I also do a podcast where I talk about Gilmore Girls"
01:02:56;01:02:59;"Now, Gilmore Girls, for people who don't know, that's a TV program"
01:02:59;01:03:00;"Yeah"
01:03:00;01:03:02;"Is it still on? What channel can I catch it on?"
01:03:02;01:03:06;"You can catch it on ABC Family, although it's been off the air for 8 years"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"You can catch reruns on ABC Family"
01:03:08;01:03:09;"Oh, what, they cancelled it?"
01:03:09;01:03:12;"Yeah, like 7 years after they started"
01:03:12;01:03:13;"So they had a good run"
01:03:13;01:03:17;"Okay, so what do you guys talk about, like specifically, with Gilmore Girls?"
01:03:17;01:03:21;"Well, so, I have never seen the show and my friends are a really big fan of it"
01:03:21;01:03:24;"So we started watching every single episode as we go"
01:03:24;01:03:28;"And just each episode is a recap of that episode and our opinions on the episode"
01:03:28;01:03:31;"And right now we're just about to start season 5"
01:03:31;01:03:33;"And you still have never watched a single episode?"
01:03:33;01:03:34;"No, no, I haven't"
01:03:34;01:03:35;"Oh, you actually watch it and then..."
01:03:35;01:03:40;"Although I'd love to do a show where I talk about an episode of something having not watched it ever"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"Jake, are you familiar with this program?"
01:03:42;01:03:43;"No, I mean I've heard of it"
01:03:43;01:03:44;"You've heard of Gilmore Girls?"
01:03:44;01:03:47;"Never saw it, and so that's a show that has maniac fans"
01:03:47;01:03:48;"Oh yeah"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"And this show, it takes place in New England?"
01:03:50;01:03:51;"Yeah, Connecticut"
01:03:51;01:03:52;"Where, Connecticut?"
01:03:52;01:03:53;"Hartford"
01:03:53;01:03:54;"That's where Jake's from"
01:03:54;01:03:55;"Oh really?"
01:03:55;01:03:57;"I don't think there's enough Connecticut-based programs"
01:03:57;01:03:59;"It's set in Hartford specifically?"
01:03:59;01:04:03;"Well, it's in Hartford and in a fictional town called Stars Hollow outside of Hartford"
01:04:03;01:04:07;"And Stars Hollow is like a kind of preppy little all-American type town?"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"Yeah, there's like a thousand people in it"
01:04:09;01:04:10;"Okay"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"Hartford's a weird choice, sorry"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"Yeah, Hartford's definitely a weird choice"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"That's just a zero city"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"Where would you have made it if you had..."
01:04:17;01:04:22;"I mean if you want to do a glamorous sort of Connecticut thing on TV, you would do like the Southwest Corner"
01:04:22;01:04:24;"You would do Greenwich, Fairfield"
01:04:24;01:04:28;"You know what television program took place in Connecticut a little bit?"
01:04:28;01:04:29;"What?"
01:04:29;01:04:30;"Mad Men"
01:04:30;01:04:31;"Oh yeah"
01:04:31;01:04:34;"Pete Campbell moves to Connecticut and lives in Costco"
01:04:34;01:04:40;"Which is funny because Vincent Carthizer who plays Pete Campbell is now married to Alexis Badell"
01:04:40;01:04:41;"Who was the star of Gilmore Girls"
01:04:41;01:04:42;"That's correct"
01:04:42;01:04:43;"She was the Gilmore Girl"
01:04:43;01:04:44;"Yeah"
01:04:44;01:04:46;"Okay guys, so Gilmore Girls, check it out on ABC Family"
01:04:46;01:04:49;"We're going to be right back with more from Electrolymon"

01:07:46;01:07:48;"And I moved my arms around"
01:07:48;01:07:51;"Moved my arms around"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"This summer I swam in the ocean"
01:07:53;01:07:56;"In a swim in a swimming pool"

01:08:19;01:08:21;"And you know that that's not all"
01:08:21;01:08:24;"I did the breaststroke and the butterfly"

01:08:27;01:08:29;"The old Australian crawl"
01:08:29;01:08:32;"This summer I swam in a public place"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"In a reservoir to go"
01:08:34;01:08:37;"At the latter I was informal"
01:08:37;01:08:40;"At the former I wore my suit"
01:08:40;01:08:43;"I wore my swimming suit, yeah"
01:08:43;01:08:55;"banjo solo"

01:09:03;01:09:05;"I did a cannonball"

01:09:53;01:09:55;"happy, sad, so many emotions"
01:09:55;01:09:56;"in that song."
01:09:56;01:09:57;"That song, I've never really"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"watched Gilmore Girls,"
01:09:59;01:10:00;"but I imagine Gilmore Girls"
01:10:00;01:10:01;"feels like that song."
01:10:01;01:10:02;"I feel like this show is sponsored"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"by Gilmore Girls unofficially now."
01:10:04;01:10:05;"Okay, I want everybody"
01:10:05;01:10:06;"to check out Gilmore Girls."
01:10:06;01:10:07;"As I said before, Demi,"
01:10:07;01:10:09;"I first met you via Twitter."
01:10:09;01:10:12;"I saw this dude, Electro Lemon,"
01:10:12;01:10:13;"writing up some tweets,"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"and we've been meaning to try this"
01:10:14;01:10:16;"on the show because it's 2015,"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"you want to integrate social media"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"with other content,"
01:10:20;01:10:21;"so we figured we got somebody"
01:10:21;01:10:22;"who kind of has a healthy"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"relationship with Twitter."
01:10:24;01:10:25;"Why not go through"
01:10:25;01:10:26;"some of his tweets?"
01:10:26;01:10:27;"So why don't you read to us"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"in whatever voice you think"
01:10:29;01:10:30;"is appropriate"
01:10:30;01:10:31;"some of your last tweets."
01:10:31;01:10:33;"The very last thing I tweeted"
01:10:33;01:10:34;"was earlier today,"
01:10:34;01:10:35;"and it was,"
01:10:35;01:10:36;"""If you ever run into me"
01:10:36;01:10:37;"on the street,"
01:10:37;01:10:38;"ask me to do my pitch perfect"
01:10:38;01:10:39;"'What if Bane was the tiger"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"from Jungle Book' impression."""
01:10:41;01:10:43;"How would you classify those accents?"
01:10:43;01:10:44;"Uh..."
01:10:44;01:10:45;"Fancy man?"
01:10:45;01:10:46;"Well, the one for Bane"
01:10:46;01:10:47;"is definitely a fancy man,"
01:10:47;01:10:48;"but the..."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"A fancy British vaudevillian."
01:10:50;01:10:51;"Right."
01:10:51;01:10:52;"Curled mustache,"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"WD--"
01:10:53;01:10:54;"Bruce Wayne!"
01:10:54;01:10:55;"Exactly."
01:10:55;01:10:56;"Wait, do that again."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"Bruce Wayne!"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"Wait, hold on."
01:10:58;01:10:59;"Can I do a good one?"
01:10:59;01:11:00;"Bruce Wayne!"
01:11:00;01:11:01;"Br--"
01:11:01;01:11:02;"Bruce Wayne!"
01:11:02;01:11:03;"Mmm."
01:11:03;01:11:04;"It's like that,"
01:11:04;01:11:05;"but then his mouth is covered"
01:11:05;01:11:06;"by like a cheese grater"
01:11:06;01:11:07;"or something."
01:11:07;01:11:09;"I was born in the darkness."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"You merely a--"
01:11:10;01:11:11;"Mmm."
01:11:11;01:11:12;"No, no."
01:11:12;01:11:13;"I give up."
01:11:13;01:11:14;"I didn't even realize"
01:11:14;01:11:15;"that Bane was British."
01:11:15;01:11:16;"Well, Bane is played by"
01:11:16;01:11:17;"one of the greatest actors"
01:11:17;01:11:18;"of all time, Tom Hardy."
01:11:18;01:11:19;"No, I'm aware of that."
01:11:19;01:11:20;"I'm aware that Tom Hardy"
01:11:20;01:11:21;"is British,"
01:11:21;01:11:22;"but I never realized"
01:11:22;01:11:23;"that he was doing"
01:11:23;01:11:24;"a British accent"
01:11:24;01:11:25;"doing his natural voice."
01:11:25;01:11:26;"The film implies that Bane"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"is from some sort of, like,"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"Central Asian country, right?"
01:11:30;01:11:31;"Yeah."
01:11:31;01:11:32;"Because Bane is from"
01:11:32;01:11:33;"the country with the pit."
01:11:33;01:11:34;"That's right."
01:11:34;01:11:35;"But you lose your accent"
01:11:35;01:11:36;"in the pit,"
01:11:36;01:11:37;"so you just kind of adopt"
01:11:37;01:11:38;"whatever sounds you hear."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"What was that movie called?"
01:11:39;01:11:40;"The Dark Knight Rises?"
01:11:40;01:11:41;"The Dark Knight Rises."
01:11:41;01:11:42;"That's another one I want every--"
01:11:42;01:11:43;"Excuse me?"
01:11:43;01:11:44;"That movie sucked."
01:11:44;01:11:45;"That was a--"
01:11:45;01:11:46;"Oh, come on."
01:11:46;01:11:47;"Now we're gonna get into it."
01:11:47;01:11:48;"All right, so Ezra's pro"
01:11:48;01:11:49;"Dark Knight Rises"
01:11:49;01:11:50;"and Jake is anti."
01:11:50;01:11:51;"State your case."
01:11:51;01:11:52;"I think--"
01:11:52;01:11:53;"I love that David's"
01:11:53;01:11:54;"just taking over as the host now."
01:11:54;01:11:55;"I actually appreciate that."
01:11:55;01:11:56;"I think that The Dark Knight"
01:11:56;01:11:57;"was a beautiful film."
01:11:57;01:11:58;"I don't know,"
01:11:58;01:11:59;"I just felt like it was moody"
01:11:59;01:12:00;"and dark and better"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"than the Heath Ledger one."
01:12:02;01:12:03;"Wow."
01:12:03;01:12:04;"I found that movie"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"to be unrelentingly grim."
01:12:06;01:12:08;"I felt like they wasted Tom Hardy,"
01:12:08;01:12:09;"who, as you said,"
01:12:09;01:12:10;"is a great actor,"
01:12:10;01:12:11;"very charismatic."
01:12:11;01:12:12;"I didn't even know"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"that that was him."
01:12:14;01:12:17;"I thought Bane had zero--"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"So your primary critique"
01:12:19;01:12:20;"of the film is that"
01:12:20;01:12:22;"they should have had Bane"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"not wear a mask."
01:12:24;01:12:25;"Yeah, and not speak"
01:12:25;01:12:26;"in that stupid voice."
01:12:26;01:12:27;"And also, what happened"
01:12:27;01:12:28;"to Batman's voice?"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"Why is that three octaves lower"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"than a normal human voice?"
01:12:32;01:12:33;"If he's Batman,"
01:12:33;01:12:34;"he's gotta disguise his voice"
01:12:34;01:12:35;"'cause he's also"
01:12:35;01:12:36;"the most famous man"
01:12:36;01:12:37;"in all of God."
01:12:37;01:12:38;"Right, that's what he's doing."
01:12:38;01:12:39;"That's always what I assume."
01:12:39;01:12:40;"And also, I loved how weird"
01:12:40;01:12:41;"Bane's voice was"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"and how it was really deep."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"Yeah."
01:12:44;01:12:45;"Someone has to die, comrade!"
01:12:45;01:12:46;"He sounds--"
01:12:46;01:12:47;"And it's so loud,"
01:12:47;01:12:48;"even though--"
