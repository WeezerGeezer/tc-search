00:00;00:06;"Tom Crysis back once again. Today in the studio we'll be joined by Gerard Carmichael,"
00:06;00:13;"my favorite comedian of all time. We'll also talk to Steve Horlick, composer of"
00:13;00:20;"the Reading Rainbow theme song, as well as RJ Ritchie, Kid Rock's son, Apple Genius"
00:20;00:28;"employee, and rising music star. This plus fan mail and the top five, today on"
00:28;00:36;"Time Crisis with Ezra King. Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep. Spawn One."
00:36;00:50;"They passed me by, all of those great romances. You are a friend to a many, all my rightful chances."
00:50;01:04;"My picture clear, everything seems so easy. And so I delve to the floor, when the bus had to go."
01:04;01:15;"Now it's different, I want you to know. One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:15;01:20;"Keep an eye on me babe."
01:20;01:29;"Tom Crysis back again. I'm here with Jake and Gerard Carmichael. What? Honorary member of the Crysis crew."
01:29;01:34;"I feel so connected to you guys. You've been on it more than anybody else. I like this place."
01:34;01:40;"It feels all warm and nice. We're very glad to have you back, even if only for the beginning of the show."
01:40;01:47;"We appreciate that. So just to set the stage for the people at home, because radio is not a visual medium,"
01:47;01:53;"both Jake and I are wearing Grateful Dead shirts right now. This was a gift you gave me just right now."
01:53;01:59;"I just gave Jake a bootleg Grateful Dead shirt that's a Grateful Dead and Mets baseball shirt."
01:59;02:02;"Mets logo within the skull of the Steely logo."
02:02;02:08;"Because I was just browsing Grateful Dead shirts on the internet. And you grew up as a Mets fan, right?"
02:08;02:10;"Yankees, but it's..."
02:10;02:12;"I really thought you were a Mets fan."
02:12;02:13;"No, no, no."
02:13;02:14;"Oh, that's hilarious."
02:14;02:17;"I'm ride or die '86 Mets. I mean, how could you not?"
02:17;02:24;"And then I'm wearing this like vintage weird one that was like from a series of concerts in 1985 in San Francisco."
02:24;02:26;"Oh, I thought it was Japan."
02:26;02:28;"I don't know if the Dead ever played Japan, but it's..."
02:28;02:29;"That's a good question."
02:29;02:33;"It was the year of the ox. But anyway, so we talk about the Grateful Dead on the show a lot."
02:33;02:39;"And so, Gerard, just before we started, you said you weren't sure if you've ever heard a Grateful Dead song."
02:39;02:43;"Yeah, I don't think I've ever knowingly. I'll say knowingly. I'm sure I was in a bar or something."
02:43;02:51;"And it came on and I was like, ""Oh, what is this?"" But knowingly, I don't think I've ever heard a single Grateful Dead song."
02:51;02:52;"Interesting."
02:52;02:55;"Do you know the name of a single member of the band?"
02:55;02:57;"Uh, in there, Jerry?"
02:57;02:59;"Yep. Jerry what?"
02:59;03:03;"Ah, damn it. Jerry, uh... You know, Jerry!"
03:03;03:05;"Gar."
03:05;03:07;"Jerry, come on. Jerry!"
03:07;03:09;"Jerry Gar."
03:09;03:10;"Gar's..."
03:10;03:12;"Wait, what?"
03:12;03:13;"Wait, Jerry Garcia."
03:13;03:14;"Garcia, that's right."
03:14;03:15;"Sounds familiar."
03:15;03:18;"That's right. Oh, yeah. Jerry Garcia. Of course, Jerry Garcia."
03:18;03:20;"I wonder if you'd like them."
03:20;03:25;"I wonder what the most famous Dead song is that you might have heard incidentally."
03:25;03:27;"Is there one like in a commercial?"
03:27;03:28;"No."
03:28;03:29;"Oh."
03:29;03:33;"I mean, there's this one, like, ""Driving That Train High On Cocaine."""
03:33;03:34;"Right."
03:34;03:35;"Let's see."
03:39;03:44;"Driving that train, high on cocaine."
03:44;03:45;"Ringing a bell?"
03:45;03:51;"Nope. Never heard it before in my life, but I've never heard a title and a vibe match so perfectly."
03:51;03:52;"True."
03:52;03:53;"That sounds like you."
03:56;03:58;"Do you like hippie s***?"
03:58;04:02;"Yeah. I mean, it's a fun vibe, like, you know."
04:02;04:03;"Oh, wow."
04:03;04:08;"Well, the first days are the hardest days, don't you worry."
04:08;04:12;"How's this sitting with you?"
04:12;04:14;"I mean, it's okay."
04:14;04:19;"This just sounds like..."
04:19;04:20;"It's nice."
04:20;04:21;"Be honest."
04:21;04:24;"It just kind of sounds like your dad's friends."
04:24;04:31;"Just like your dad's friends singing, like, you know, ""Oh, that's fun. It's nice. Oh, you guys sound nice together."""
04:31;04:33;"All right. Wait. How about this?"
04:33;04:34;"They're known for their live shows."
04:34;04:35;"Yeah."
04:35;04:38;"So this is live."
04:38;04:39;"China Cat? I was just thinking that."
04:39;04:42;"Yeah."
04:42;04:49;"This is live in Paris in 1972."
04:49;04:50;"This one's a little groovier."
04:50;04:51;"Yeah, yeah. It's groovier."
04:59;05:02;"Oh, that's great. That's great."
05:02;05:05;"I feel like actually this is the one that wins people over."
05:05;05:06;"Oh, that's fantastic."
05:06;05:07;"Yeah."
05:07;05:08;"That line is so sick."
05:08;05:17;"I've been listening to a lot of Dead at home a lot, and the only time I ever listened to one where Rashida was like, ""What's that?"" was this."
05:17;05:22;"Something about this is like, it's really soulful."
05:22;05:29;"I think the thing that Jake really likes about the Dead and which I, via Jake, like about the Dead is just that tasteful guitar tone."
05:29;05:30;"Yeah."
05:30;05:31;"Yeah. I like about the tasteful guitar."
05:31;05:34;"All right. How about this one?"
05:34;05:36;"Oh, come on."
05:36;05:38;"Wait, now you know this one."
05:38;05:39;"You know this one."
05:42;05:44;"What's this song?"
05:44;05:46;"The Reading Rainbow."
05:46;05:48;"The greatest theme song of all time."
05:48;05:49;"I know."
05:49;05:50;"How old are you?"
05:50;05:51;"30."
05:51;05:53;"So you're 30. I'm 33."
05:53;05:55;"Because, Jake, you were like deeply unfamiliar with this."
05:55;05:56;"Yeah."
05:56;05:57;"Oh, you don't know this?"
05:57;05:58;"No, I didn't know it."
05:58;05:59;"How old are you?"
05:59;06:00;"Oh, okay."
06:00;06:01;"Yeah, it's right after."
06:01;06:03;"Because my brother wouldn't respond to this."
06:03;06:04;"My brother's 39."
06:04;06:05;"Really?"
06:05;06:07;"And he wouldn't respond to the Reading."
06:07;06:09;"Right. We were right in the sweet spot."
06:09;06:11;"And they changed the theme."
06:11;06:12;"Like, they had a later one."
06:12;06:13;"Chaka Khan."
06:13;06:14;"Yeah, oh, you're ahead."
06:14;06:15;"Yeah."
06:15;06:16;"You're reading Rainbowhead."
06:16;06:18;"Oh, I'm a Rainbowhead."
06:18;06:21;"We talked about this on the last episode, and we're actually about to."
06:21;06:23;"Deadheads are angry right now."
06:23;06:25;"They're just angry."
06:25;06:28;"I'm like, ""Who are the Grateful Dead? Jerry what?"""
06:28;06:30;"No, I'm a Rainbowhead, bro."
06:30;06:31;"Just like, they hate."
06:31;06:32;"I'm sorry."
06:32;06:35;"This is that real kind of vibe hippie reading Rainbow."
06:35;06:36;"Reading Rainbow."
06:36;06:37;"So, here's the thing."
06:37;06:39;"The theme -- this is me being honest."
06:39;06:42;"I don't want to potentially stereotype being the only black person in the room."
06:42;06:47;"But I love that theme song, hated the show."
06:47;06:49;"I liked reading as a kid."
06:49;06:50;"I read a lot."
06:50;06:52;"I don't need you to read to me."
06:52;06:55;"I didn't even like my mom reading stories to me."
06:55;06:59;"It's like, no, either tell me -- don't read a passage for me."
06:59;07:00;"I don't do books on tape."
07:00;07:02;"Well, it's not my vibe."
07:02;07:03;"Right."
07:03;07:05;"Yeah, I don't want to -- because there are actual cartoons."
07:05;07:06;"You like to do it yourself."
07:06;07:07;"I don't want to just [bleep] show."
07:07;07:08;"It's a good show."
07:08;07:12;"But it lived in this weird gray area where it wasn't a cartoon,"
07:12;07:14;"and it wasn't somebody reading to you."
07:14;07:18;"It was just like pictures of a book where the camera moves,"
07:18;07:21;"but the picture doesn't, and it's just like this purgatory of like --"
07:21;07:22;"It's a poor man's cartoon."
07:22;07:23;"It was like kill me."
07:23;07:24;"I'd rather --"
07:24;07:25;"I know what you mean."
07:25;07:27;"Reading Rainbow wasn't paced well."
07:27;07:28;"Yeah, it was not paced well."
07:28;07:30;"LeVar Burton, incredibly condescending."
07:30;07:31;"Incredibly."
07:31;07:33;"As a host."
07:33;07:35;"The part I always thought was so awkward is that they would force these,"
07:35;07:38;"like, five- or six-year-old, like, child actors to do book reviews."
07:38;07:41;"We were talking about this last time where the kids would just be like,"
07:41;07:43;"""Jumanji, it's a book."""
07:43;07:46;"And we were saying it's like so Vanessa Bayer on SNL, just like --"
07:46;07:47;"Rainbow fish."
07:48;07:50;"But don't take my word for it."
07:50;07:51;"But, yeah, okay."
07:51;07:54;"And then once you show the fish, you've ruined the book."
07:54;07:55;"Yeah."
07:55;07:59;"Once you see the pop out at the end with the fish that's coming to its own."
07:59;08:01;"It's also -- yeah, that show is nothing but spoilers."
08:01;08:02;"Spoilers."
08:02;08:04;"Spoiler alert, here is the ending of this book."
08:04;08:07;"Maybe the only good thing about Reading Rainbow was the song."
08:07;08:08;"Oh, the song was perfect."
08:08;08:11;"Also, before it even kicks in, just listen to that synth."
08:11;08:14;"[Synth music]"
08:14;08:15;"♪ Butterfly in the sky ♪"
08:15;08:16;"Vibey."
08:16;08:17;"Oh, such a vibe."
08:17;08:18;"♪ I can go twice as high ♪"
08:18;08:20;"And it's funky, like, great rhythm section."
08:20;08:22;"♪ Take a look, it's in a book ♪"
08:22;08:25;"♪ Reading Rainbow ♪"
08:25;08:30;"♪ I can go anywhere ♪"
08:30;08:32;"It makes me so happy."
08:32;08:34;"Also, because the opening was a cartoon."
08:34;08:36;"Yes, an actual cartoon."
08:36;08:41;"♪ I can be anything ♪"
08:41;08:42;"You hear that harmony?"
08:42;08:43;"Yeah, it's beautiful."
08:43;08:45;"♪ Take a look, it's in a book ♪"
08:45;08:47;"♪ Reading Rainbow ♪"
08:47;08:48;"The harmony comes in right here."
08:48;08:50;"♪ Reading Rainbow ♪"
08:54;08:55;"Oh, and out?"
08:55;08:58;"And that whole song's only 54 seconds."
08:58;09:04;"The only song that has, that mirrors the intro/outro that well is Pastime Paradise with the gong."
09:04;09:05;"The gong."
09:05;09:07;"I love, yeah, I love a symmetrical song."
09:07;09:08;"Yeah, a symmetrical song."
09:08;09:09;"Symmetrical song."
09:09;09:11;"Just like, let's leave the way we came in this [bleep]"
09:11;09:13;"54 seconds, just a great tune."
09:13;09:20;"In, out, one of the greatest, genuinely top five greatest sung theme songs of all time."
09:20;09:28;"Jara, you had no idea when you came into Time Crisis today that you were going to actually get on the phone with Steve Horlick, composer of Reading Rainbow theme song."
09:28;09:30;"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Steve Horlick is here?"
09:30;09:36;"You're about to talk to Steve Horlick because when, you're a friend of the show, so you come by very casually."
09:36;09:39;"You don't know what we have on tap for the day."
09:39;09:40;"Yeah, I just showed up and this is..."
09:40;09:43;"I didn't even know if you were ahead."
09:43;09:45;"I'm a rainbow head, dude."
09:45;09:48;"Okay, this is perfect. All right, so let's talk to Steve, the composer."
09:48;09:52;"Now, let's go into the Time Crisis hotline."
09:52;09:56;"Hello, Steve?"
09:56;09:57;"Hey, hi."
09:57;09:58;"Steve!"
09:58;10:02;"Hey, what's up, Steve? This is Ezra on Time Crisis and you're also on with Jarod and Jake."
10:02;10:03;"Very nice to meet you, Steve."
10:03;10:04;"Hey, guys."
10:04;10:06;"We were just blasting the Reading Rainbow theme song."
10:06;10:10;"This is the second week in a row that we've talked about it because we're all in agreement here."
10:10;10:16;"It's one of the best, not even just children's TV themes of all time, one of the best TV themes of all time."
10:16;10:18;"Of all time, yeah, absolutely."
10:18;10:21;"Oh, jeez, you guys are great. Thanks. I really appreciate that."
10:21;10:23;"So right off the bat, we have a lot of questions for you."
10:23;10:28;"So did you compose this front to back? Did you do the music? Did you do the lyrics, all the above?"
10:28;10:38;"I did the music and all of the production, which at its time was, I think people have told me it's the first all-electronic theme song ever on TV."
10:38;10:39;"Oh, really?"
10:39;10:44;"I don't know if that's true. It's definitely the first all-electronic kids' TV theme song."
10:44;10:46;"We found it very striking, that opening synth."
10:46;10:47;"Yeah."
10:47;10:48;"So you're playing that?"
10:48;10:59;"That opening synth was made on a very rare module designed by Donald Buchla, who was one of the inventors of the synthesizers back in the '60s."
10:59;11:05;"He only made eight of those modules. It was called the Multiple Arbitrary Function Generator. Crazy name, right?"
11:05;11:07;"Things sounded more futuristic back then."
11:07;11:08;"Yeah."
11:08;11:12;"That's such a futuristic sounding thing. It's like a Jetsons name for it."
11:12;11:17;"Totally. It was very cool because you know, sequencers, he invented the sequencer."
11:17;11:18;"Oh, wow."
11:18;11:20;"He also allowed you to randomize a bunch of notes."
11:20;11:26;"I picked a bunch of notes that sounded good to me and I just randomized them and processed them and did all kinds of cool stuff."
11:26;11:31;"It really became a very important piece of that theme song."
11:31;11:35;"The whole concept of that, by the way, was so that what kids would hear it, they'd just run into the TV set."
11:35;11:37;"That's what I wanted to do."
11:37;11:38;"Oh, yeah. You can feel that."
11:38;11:39;"That way it worked."
11:39;11:42;"As soon as you hear that synth, and yeah, because the theme builds so well."
11:42;11:43;"It starts with the synth."
11:43;11:44;"Yeah."
11:44;11:47;"The bass and drums kick in and the vocals and it keeps building."
11:47;11:50;"So, yeah, you have a little time to kind of run over to the TV."
11:50;11:53;"Not bad for 8-bit and mono recording."
11:53;11:56;"That's a 1980, '81 when that was."
11:56;11:57;"Oh, that was '81?"
11:57;11:58;"Oh, wow."
11:58;11:59;"'81."
11:59;12:02;"Had you composed other songs prior to that?"
12:02;12:05;"This is just trying to do music for commercials."
12:05;12:10;"That's really why I came to New York and to play avant-garde electronic music in all the clubs, which I was doing too."
12:10;12:14;"Oh, yeah. Steve, Steve, we've got to go a little deeper on that."
12:14;12:16;"We all lit up. We're like, ""Wait."""
12:16;12:22;"So you were, when you say you're playing in the clubs, so this is the early '80s New York, you're doing avant-garde electronic music."
12:22;12:26;"Like, what type of club? Are you crossing paths with like the punk scene?"
12:26;12:27;"Arthur Russell?"
12:27;12:29;"Yeah, what was your milieu in New York?"
12:29;12:34;"We had this band called the Electronic Art Ensemble, and we played all over the place."
12:34;12:43;"We played the kitchen, we played Carnegie Recital Hall, and basically we were playing noise back when no one was doing noise, right?"
12:43;12:45;"Kind of ahead of our time."
12:45;12:49;"So you're doing this like really heady, noisy music."
12:49;12:55;"So whose idea was it to get somebody like that to do the new children's theme song?"
12:55;13:03;"Well, what happened was that they were creating a pilot for a TV, Dennis Kleiman, who wrote the lyrics, by the way,"
13:03;13:07;"for the Reading Rainbow theme song, along with my girlfriend at the time, Janet Weir, who is now my wife."
13:07;13:10;"Reading Rainbow, just success stories all around."
13:10;13:16;"You know, it came through the grapevine that they were doing this pilot."
13:16;13:21;"You know, they were trying to do a TV show for kids. We heard it was about a rainbow and about reading."
13:21;13:25;"And so we did a demo, and we were just kids. I was 26 years old, right?"
13:25;13:33;"And for some reason, they picked ours, and that led to a whole career of writing music for kids' TV, which was really awesome."
13:33;13:39;"So, okay, if I may, when you actually composed it, when you're just going in the studio, what are you doing?"
13:39;13:42;"Are you getting a little high coming up with this?"
13:42;13:48;"Because it's such a great—you don't have to answer that, obviously, but I really want to know what that vibe was."
13:48;13:54;"Because we were just talking about how we love a complete song, just the same synth that brought it in, took it out,"
13:54;13:57;"and just like how layered it is."
13:57;14:02;"But I'm just wondering what that moment was like when you actually had the spark for the song."
14:02;14:07;"You know, I—the original sketch, right, on ""Snooper,"" and I remember that moment really clearly."
14:07;14:16;"We were sitting around a big stump, and Janet and Dennis came up with the line, something about a butterfly flying in the sky."
14:16;14:22;"That just turned into a melody, and from there, the melody kind of took over, and they, you know, we—"
14:22;14:27;"I know the lyrics, you know, ""I have a voice that's high,"" and we just kept building it from there,"
14:27;14:30;"and it was organic in the way it happened."
14:30;14:35;"At that time in the early '80s, I imagine like the downtown noise scene,"
14:35;14:41;"lyrics about butterflies in the sky must have seemed like some real '60s hippie nonsense."
14:41;14:45;"Did you have mixed feelings about that, being like a harsh noise musician?"
14:45;14:48;"No, because, you know, I love all kinds of music."
14:48;14:49;"Okay."
14:49;14:55;"Having the opportunity to write a song like that was really—we just had so much fun composing that thing."
14:55;14:59;"So since then, you've been doing other composing for children's shows."
14:59;15:01;"What else have you been up to?"
15:01;15:04;"I still perform live electronic music to this very day."
15:04;15:07;"I do 3D immersive sound concerts."
15:07;15:09;"I did a couple of concerts in Berlin."
15:09;15:14;"I did a couple of concerts in New York, and I'm doing that, which is really a lot of fun."
15:14;15:17;"I'm also moving into online education."
15:17;15:20;"I have a partner in a company called ProVideo."
15:20;15:24;"We teach everybody all over the world how to use ProTools and Logic."
15:24;15:25;"Oh, cool."
15:25;15:26;"How to produce music."
15:26;15:28;"Are you still an analog synth guy?"
15:28;15:29;"I am."
15:29;15:31;"A huge Eurorack system."
15:31;15:37;"I love analog, and I love digital, but I have a huge Eurorack system and two Buchla systems,"
15:37;15:41;"and I'm always doing sound design and creating the most crazy stuff."
15:41;15:45;"I'm actually working on an album right now with Dream Theater's Jordan Rudess, the keyboard player."
15:45;15:46;"Oh, sick."
15:46;15:47;"Legit."
15:47;15:50;"He's doing acoustic piano, I'm doing electronics and the contrast."
15:50;15:52;"It's really quite beautiful."
15:52;15:53;"That's amazing."
15:53;15:56;"So, Steve, we just got one more kind of random question for you,"
15:56;16:00;"just because this is what we were talking about before we got into our Reading Rainbow segment."
16:00;16:02;"Are you a Grateful Dead fan?"
16:02;16:06;"No."
16:06;16:07;"Fair enough."
16:07;16:10;"But you said your wife's last name is Weir?"
16:10;16:12;"Oh, yeah, right."
16:12;16:14;"Is she related to Bob?"
16:14;16:16;"No, she's not related to Bob."
16:16;16:19;"Okay, well, don't be so sure."
16:19;16:22;"I'm an amateur genealogist."
16:22;16:24;"I might get back to you with some shocking information."
16:24;16:31;"I'm waiting for someone to grab a sample and make a loop out of Reading Rainbow and push it into the next universe."
16:31;16:33;"I think we might be the men for the job."
16:33;16:36;"I think that would be totally cool, man."
16:36;16:38;"I mean, it still sounds great, man."
16:38;16:39;"You sound like a deadhead."
16:39;16:41;"You do sound a little like a deadhead."
16:41;16:43;"That would be totally cool, man."
16:43;16:50;"I guess that there's analog synth head and deadheads are similar, and yet the twain shall never meet."
16:50;16:52;"The twain have met."
16:52;17:01;"All right, well, Steve, obviously you get a pass for not liking the Grateful Dead because you composed the Reading Rainbow theme song, and you're a sick musician."
17:01;17:02;"Thanks so much for calling in, man."
17:02;17:03;"We really appreciate it."
17:03;17:04;"It was a lot of fun."
17:04;17:05;"Thank you for calling."
17:05;17:06;"I appreciate it."
18:05;18:20;"That was a hell of a call, man."
18:20;18:21;"I like Steve Horlick."
18:21;18:24;"I still think that they were hot when they composed this song."
18:24;18:25;"Yeah."
18:25;18:28;"But I'm also picturing straight-edge noise musicians."
18:28;18:31;"They're just in a loft in Tribeca in the early '80s."
18:31;18:34;"Yeah, just like early adapter of pour over coffee."
18:34;18:36;"Maybe they're on a different truck."
18:36;18:38;"[laughter]"
18:38;18:39;"You know what I mean?"
18:39;18:40;"Just like, ""Not a deadhead."""
18:40;18:42;"So back to the Grateful Dead."
18:42;18:44;"We got one more dead thing."
18:44;18:49;"Okay, so, Drodd, now you maybe kind of know one or two Grateful Dead songs out of the past 10 minutes."
18:49;18:50;"Yeah."
18:50;18:51;"What was it called?"
18:51;18:52;"The Frisky Cat?"
18:52;18:53;"What was it?"
18:53;18:54;"KZ Jones?"
18:54;18:55;"China Cat Sunflower."
18:55;18:56;"China Cat."
18:56;18:57;"Yeah, yeah, China Cat."
18:57;18:58;"Let's do that back on."
18:58;18:59;"We got to make--"
18:59;19:00;"That's a little China Cat."
19:00;19:01;"Do you care about Game of Thrones?"
19:01;19:08;"I watched the first season, and I loved it, and then a dragon egg hatched, and I was like, ""This isn't for me."""
19:08;19:09;"Oh, that's all it took."
19:09;19:10;"That's fair."
19:10;19:13;"I don't do well with sci-fi because it's just like my niece telling me a story."
19:13;19:15;"I'm like, ""Oh, anything can happen."""
19:15;19:16;"Fantasy."
19:16;19:17;"Fantasy, whatever."
19:17;19:19;"Just, I'm like, ""Oh, anything can happen."""
19:19;19:20;"Right."
19:20;19:22;"All right, we're just making the rules up."
19:22;19:23;"I hear you."
19:23;19:24;"As we go along, okay."
19:24;19:25;"Wait, fair enough."
19:25;19:26;"Wait, Jake, do you watch Game of Thrones?"
19:26;19:27;"I'm not a fan."
19:27;19:28;"Really?"
19:28;19:29;"Straight up not a fan."
19:29;19:30;"Not a fan."
19:30;19:32;"Steve Warlick to Grateful Dead is you to GOT."
19:32;19:34;"Yeah, I'm not in."
19:34;19:35;"Really?"
19:35;19:36;"Wow."
19:36;19:37;"Are you in?"
19:37;19:38;"Yeah, I'm in."
19:38;19:39;"You watch every episode?"
19:39;19:44;"Yeah, recently because it came back on TV, so I was catching up on it."
19:44;19:46;"Oh, I've watched the last two episodes with Hannah."
19:46;19:47;"Oh, really?"
19:47;19:49;"You're just watching, like, just getting in deep?"
19:49;19:50;"Yeah, I'm on my phone."
19:50;19:51;"I'm watching."
19:51;19:52;"It's all good."
19:52;19:53;"I'm one of those guys."
19:53;19:54;"I watch the Red Wedding."
19:54;19:56;"I watched, like, the other episode."
19:56;19:58;"You're just the Greatest Hits guy."
19:58;19:59;"Yeah, Greatest Hits."
19:59;20:00;"Exactly."
20:00;20:01;"Like, the Grateful Dead."
20:01;20:02;"It's my..."
20:02;20:03;"Right, fair enough."
20:03;20:04;"I know the broad strokes."
20:04;20:05;"Okay."
20:05;20:11;"Well, clearly I did not gather the right group to talk about the connections between Game"
20:11;20:13;"of Thrones and Grateful Dead."
20:13;20:19;"But I was thinking about it because the show's back on TV recently."
20:19;20:25;"Some people are watching and talking about it, and I came across an article from 2015"
20:25;20:31;"where George R.R. Martin confirmed that there was a Grateful Dead influence on Game of Thrones"
20:31;20:37;"because he did an interview a couple years ago at the 92nd Street Y in New York, and"
20:37;20:41;"somebody just randomly asked him, like, ""Are you a Deadhead?"""
20:41;20:42;"This was his answer."
20:42;20:45;"Do your books have any references to the Grateful Dead?"
20:45;20:50;"You call your home Tarapin Station, and the song Direwolf and Cassidy and Darkstar have"
20:50;20:52;"names and references in the books."
20:52;20:53;"Direwolf's..."
20:53;20:54;"[laughter]"
20:54;20:57;"Well, I'm certainly a fan of the Grateful Dead."
20:57;21:05;"I've attended Grateful Dead coverts, and my wife Paris is perhaps even more of a fan of"
21:05;21:06;"the Grateful Dead."
21:06;21:14;"And there are a lot of Grateful Dead references in my famous rock and roll novel, The Armageddon"
21:14;21:15;"Rag."
21:15;21:16;"Not familiar."
21:16;21:22;"In fact, at one point we were hoping to make a movie of that and film the Nausicaa concert"
21:22;21:30;"scenes at Grateful Dead concerts, but of course that came to nothing, sad to say."
21:30;21:35;"And I do have Grateful Dead lyrics always coming around and rattling around in my head."
21:35;21:38;"Ripple is one of my favorite songs of all time."
21:38;21:40;"There is a road, no simple..."
21:40;21:42;"Oh man, he speaks like a novelist."
21:42;21:45;"That's actually exactly what you want his voice to sound like."
21:45;21:47;"The dude who wrote Game of Thrones."
21:47;21:48;"But, okay, so..."
21:48;21:51;"I also felt like the answer was ""yeah."""
21:51;21:52;"[laughter]"
21:52;21:54;"That's also an acceptable..."
21:54;21:55;"You like the Grateful Dead?"
21:55;21:56;"Yeah, they're alright."
21:56;21:57;"Yeah."
21:57;21:59;"Well, he said Ripple's one of his favorite songs of all time."
21:59;22:00;"There is a road, no simple highway."
22:00;22:04;"I guess you could say Game of Thrones is a famously complicated show."
22:04;22:06;"Maybe Ripple and Cousin do that."
22:06;22:09;"And in Game of Thrones, there are things called weirwood trees."
22:09;22:12;"And yes, they're named after Mr. Bob Weir."
22:12;22:13;"Wow."
22:13;22:14;"Oh, that's nice."
22:14;22:16;"Yeah, I mean, there's like a mystical hippie vibe."
22:16;22:17;"Yeah, but there's..."
22:17;22:19;"Not hippie, but like mystical vibe."
22:19;22:22;"You know, I really thought I was going to get more mileage out of this Game of Thrones, Grateful Dead."
22:22;22:27;"Never before have I felt information mean so much and yet mean nothing at all."
22:27;22:33;"It's like, I know that there are a lot of people that will hear this and go, ""Oh, wow."""
22:33;22:36;"And it's just funny looking around the room with us just being like, ""Oh, okay."""
22:36;22:38;"Yeah, nobody in this room."
22:38;22:43;"Imagine if when we were on the phone with Steve Horlick, composer of the Reed and Rainbow theme song,"
22:43;22:45;"when I asked him if he liked the Grateful Dead, he's like, ""No."""
22:45;22:47;"I'm just like, ""Do you like Game of Thrones?"""
22:47;22:48;"He's like, ""No."""
22:48;22:51;"""Well, listen to this."""
22:51;22:53;"""Well, Steve, I hope you're sitting down."""
22:53;22:54;"George R.R. Martin."
22:54;22:56;"We're about to go on a ride."
22:56;22:59;"If my words did glow"
22:59;23:04;"with the gold of sunshine"
23:04;23:08;"and my tunes were played"
23:08;23:11;"on the harp on the strum,"
23:11;23:15;"would you hear my voice"
23:15;23:19;"come through the music?"
23:19;23:24;"Would you hold it near"
23:24;23:26;"as if we're your own?"
23:26;23:30;"It's a hand-me-down."
23:30;23:35;"The thoughts are broken."
23:35;23:39;"Perhaps they're better"
23:39;23:42;"left unsung."
23:42;23:45;"I don't know."
23:45;23:50;"Don't really care."
23:50;23:55;"Let there be songs"
23:55;24:00;"to fill the air."
24:00;24:07;"Ripple in still water"
24:07;24:11;"when there is no pebble tossed,"
24:11;24:14;"no wind to blow."
24:14;24:18;"Reach out your hand"
24:18;24:22;"if your cup be empty."
24:22;24:26;"If your cup is full,"
24:26;24:29;"may it be again."
24:29;24:32;"Let it be known"
24:32;24:37;"there is a fountain"
24:37;24:41;"that was not made"
24:41;24:44;"by the hands of man."
24:44;24:47;"There is a road,"
24:47;24:52;"no simple highway"
24:52;24:55;"between the dawn"
24:55;24:59;"and the dark of night."
24:59;25:02;"And if you go,"
25:02;25:07;"no one may follow."
25:07;25:12;"That path is for"
25:12;25:16;"your steps alone."
25:16;25:23;"Ripple in still water"
25:23;25:27;"when there is no pebble tossed,"
25:27;25:31;"no wind to blow."
25:31;25:34;"You choose"
25:34;25:38;"to lead, must follow."
25:38;25:42;"But if you fall,"
25:42;25:46;"you fall alone."
25:46;25:49;"If you should stand,"
25:49;25:54;"then who's to guide you?"
25:54;25:58;"If I knew the way,"
25:58;26:01;"I would take you home."
26:01;26:04;"La da da da da."
26:04;26:09;"La da da da da."
26:09;26:13;"La da da da da."
26:13;26:16;"La da da da da."
26:19;26:24;"La da da da da."
26:24;26:28;"La da da da da."
26:28;26:30;"La da da da da."
26:30;26:32;"You're listening to"
26:32;26:34;"Time Crisis"
26:34;26:36;"on BEATS 1."
26:36;26:37;"So we're just getting started,"
26:37;26:38;"but we got a real big show today."
26:38;26:40;"We're gonna be digging in the mailbag."
26:40;26:42;"We've been getting so many good listener emails lately."
26:42;26:44;"Jake's just getting inundated."
26:44;26:45;"I know the listeners have been bringing it."
26:45;26:46;"Bringing it all over the world."
26:46;26:48;"So we're gonna get into some listener emails later."
26:48;26:50;"Of course, we're gonna do the top five."
26:50;26:53;"We're gonna be comparing it to 1991 today."
26:53;26:54;"Okay."
26:54;26:55;"Why '91?"
26:55;26:57;"Don't know."
26:57;26:58;"Nirvana?"
26:58;26:59;"Because that's--"
26:59;27:01;"You say '91, I think Nirvana."
27:01;27:03;"Nope, that was late '91 anyway."
27:03;27:04;"September."
27:04;27:05;"Yeah, that was like September."
27:05;27:06;"So that's really--"
27:06;27:08;"That really wasn't popping until '92."
27:08;27:11;"I think Use Your Illusion and Nevermind"
27:11;27:12;"came out like a week apart."
27:12;27:14;"Yeah, late September."
27:14;27:15;"Yeah."
27:15;27:17;"No, but the reason we're gonna compare it to '91"
27:17;27:19;"is because we're talking about George R. R. Martin."
27:19;27:20;"Oh."
27:20;27:22;"Not a super popular man in the room,"
27:22;27:23;"but that's the year he started writing"
27:23;27:25;"A Song of Fire and Ice,"
27:25;27:27;"which is the first Game of Thrones book."
27:27;27:28;"I love it."
27:28;27:30;"Maybe we can get him on the show one day."
27:30;27:31;"That'd be sick."
27:31;27:33;"'Cause we're having no problem getting crazy guests"
27:33;27:34;"on Time Crisis."
27:34;27:35;"Let's be real."
27:35;27:37;"Already today we had Gerard."
27:37;27:38;"I mean, he's family."
27:38;27:40;"He's part of the Time Crisis family."
27:40;27:41;"But we had Steve Horlick"
27:41;27:43;"compose the Reading Rainbow theme song."
27:43;27:45;"And we're not even done."
27:45;27:47;"You know, sometimes we do these real mellow shows,"
27:47;27:50;"just you and me just shooting the [bleep] riffing."
27:50;27:52;"And then when it rains, it pours, man."
27:52;27:55;"Because we're not even done with the guests."
27:55;27:58;"Today on Time Crisis, we got R.J. Ritchie."
27:58;28:00;"A lot of people might know him"
28:00;28:02;"because he's Kid Rock's son."
28:02;28:04;"24-year-old son of Kid Rock."
28:04;28:05;"Wow."
28:05;28:06;"And Kelly South Russell,"
28:06;28:08;"who Kid Rock first met in eighth grade."
28:08;28:09;"But I don't want to--"
28:09;28:11;"Obviously, like, you know, it's not just about the dad."
28:11;28:13;"He's also a musician in his own right."
28:13;28:14;"He's starting to put out music."
28:14;28:16;"We're gonna listen to some of that."
28:16;28:19;"And he's an Apple genius."
28:19;28:21;"Works at the Apple store?"
28:21;28:22;"Yeah."
28:22;28:23;"Which city?"
28:23;28:24;"Nashville."
28:24;28:25;"Okay."
28:25;28:26;"I mean, I honestly feel like--"
28:26;28:27;"Okay, I like it."
28:27;28:28;"In some ways--"
28:28;28:29;"I don't want to overhype this,"
28:29;28:33;"but in some ways, R.J. is the perfect Time Crisis guest"
28:33;28:35;"because he makes music."
28:35;28:37;"He's a fellow company man."
28:39;28:40;"I think we could do this entire interview"
28:40;28:42;"just asking about what it's like working at the Apple store"
28:42;28:43;"because that's fascinating."
28:43;28:45;"I've always been intrigued by that."
28:45;28:46;"But then also, his dad's Kid Rock,"
28:46;28:47;"who's about to--"
28:47;28:50;"who's claiming he might run for Senate."
28:50;28:51;"Republican Party."
28:52;28:53;"I mean--"
28:53;28:55;"You know, all those, like, Republican rappers."
28:55;28:57;"He's the first, kind of."
28:57;28:59;"First Republican rapper."
28:59;29:02;"So anyway, we got so much to talk about with R.J.,"
29:02;29:04;"so let's give him a call."
29:04;29:07;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
29:07;29:10;"[phone ringing]"
29:10;29:12;"Hey, R.J., are you there?"
29:12;29:13;"Yeah, I'm here. What's up?"
29:13;29:14;"Hey, what's up, man?"
29:14;29:15;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
29:15;29:16;"You're on with me, Ezra, and Jake."
29:16;29:17;"What's up?"
29:17;29:18;"Good to meet you guys."
29:18;29:20;"How's it going?"
29:20;29:21;"Not bad."
29:21;29:23;"So where are you calling from, Nashville?"
29:23;29:25;"Yeah, Nashville, downtown, yeah."
29:25;29:28;"We understand you're also part of the Apple family."
29:28;29:29;"Yeah, yeah."
29:29;29:32;"I work at the mall here."
29:32;29:34;"At the Apple store in a mall in Nashville?"
29:34;29:35;"Mm-hmm, yeah."
29:35;29:37;"Yeah, I'm a genius over there."
29:37;29:39;"I take apart computers and fix them,"
29:39;29:41;"just as a part-time--"
29:41;29:42;"Okay, yeah, so that's your day job,"
29:42;29:44;"'cause also you're a musician making music,"
29:44;29:46;"so this is just your day job right now."
29:46;29:48;"But is that a crazy job?"
29:48;29:51;"I mean, just, like, there's been so many viral videos"
29:51;29:54;"of people just going nuts at the Genius Bar."
29:54;29:55;"It's insane."
29:55;29:58;"I love the job because of all the people you meet"
29:58;30:01;"and just--it's like every day is different,"
30:01;30:03;"and it's just an adventure,"
30:03;30:06;"and it makes me stay quick on my toes."
30:06;30:08;"It's just one of those jobs where you go in,"
30:08;30:09;"and the time flies by,"
30:09;30:13;"but, I mean, that store is jam-packed every single day."
30:13;30:15;"And, I mean, you must be catching people"
30:15;30:18;"at their lowest points, some very low moments."
30:18;30:20;"You probably have to be a therapist sometimes."
30:20;30:23;"Oh, yeah, it's crazy 'cause, you know,"
30:23;30:25;"I just deal with people every single day who come in,"
30:25;30:27;"and I'm not seeing the happy ones who buy the stuff."
30:27;30:30;"I'm seeing the people who come in and need their stuff fixed."
30:30;30:34;"So every day, it's just like, ""Oh, my God, I lost my life,"
30:34;30:36;"and I got to put it back together."""
30:36;30:38;"Right. Are you getting a lot of tears--"
30:38;30:40;"tears in the Apple Store?"
30:40;30:42;"Yeah, of course."
30:42;30:44;"I can only imagine. Just brutal."
30:44;30:46;"It's also kind of like being a doctor, I guess."
30:46;30:48;"You have to sometimes deliver the harsh news,"
30:48;30:50;"just like it couldn't be saved."
30:50;30:51;"Oh, yeah."
30:51;30:53;"So many times I'll just walk in,"
30:53;30:55;"and, you know, I'm working with someone,"
30:55;30:57;"and just have to come back out and be like,"
30:57;31:01;"""Hey, you know, this is gonna cost, like, 700 bucks to get fixed."""
31:01;31:04;"It's not like I want to bring that news,"
31:04;31:06;"but, you know, I feel like a Grim Reaper or something."
31:06;31:09;"I'm like stumbling out, like, ""Oh, God."""
31:09;31:11;"I'm also picturing, like, the college kid"
31:11;31:15;"who's got, like, their, like, 30-page essay"
31:15;31:16;"and the computer freezes,"
31:16;31:19;"and, like, they're about to, like, lose the credit,"
31:19;31:20;"and then they're gonna have--"
31:20;31:22;"like, it's gonna ruin their entire life,"
31:22;31:24;"and they're just going to you. You're their only hope."
31:24;31:28;"Yeah, the best is when you get the girl who comes from college"
31:28;31:30;"and spilled wine on it three weeks in a row"
31:30;31:33;"and comes in, spills wine."
31:33;31:36;"I'm like, ""Okay, this is gonna cost $755"
31:36;31:38;"for you to get it fixed."""
31:38;31:40;"She's like, ""Okay, cool. Yeah, my parents are coming this time."
31:40;31:41;"Next week comes in."""
31:41;31:45;"Same exact thing. I'm like, ""What did we not learn?"
31:45;31:46;"Oh, God."""
31:46;31:51;"You're getting a lot of Vanderbilt sorority and fraternity people"
31:51;31:54;"coming in with alcohol-related--"
31:54;31:55;"Oh, yeah."
31:55;31:57;"And do you, like, get into the stories with them?"
31:57;31:59;"Are you like, ""How did this happen, ma'am?"""
31:59;32:01;"Yeah, I won't fix it till they tell me."
32:01;32:03;"So that's kind of my thing."
32:03;32:05;"You gotta let me know, like, what's going on."
32:05;32:06;"Like, how'd you do this?"
32:06;32:08;"There's gotta be a good story, and if it's not good enough,"
32:08;32:10;"then you're just gonna have to make it up,"
32:10;32:12;"'cause you gotta have a good story"
32:12;32:14;"with something that expensive."
32:14;32:17;"Fair enough. Now, RJ, are you familiar with the infamous"
32:17;32:20;"""I was told by AppleCare"" video?"
32:20;32:21;"I don't really remember it."
32:21;32:22;"Jake, do you know about this?"
32:22;32:24;"I don't know it."
32:24;32:27;"So this is a woman-- I think she's a mother."
32:27;32:30;"Like, she's in the Apple store, like, pushing a stroller,"
32:30;32:34;"and she's talking to one of the geniuses at the bar."
32:34;32:37;"It's unclear what the dispute is over,"
32:37;32:39;"but she says-- they're saying, like,"
32:39;32:40;"""Ma'am, you need to calm down."""
32:40;32:42;"And she goes, ""I was told by AppleCare,"""
32:42;32:45;"and she starts yelling, ""I was told by AppleCare!"""
32:45;32:46;"Like, she's so angry."
32:46;32:49;"It looks like she's about to, like, murder somebody."
32:49;32:52;"And she just keeps yelling, ""I was told by AppleCare."""
32:52;32:55;"So have you-- so, like, we talked about the sad situations."
32:55;32:57;"Have you ever just gotten yelled at?"
32:57;32:58;"Oh, yeah."
32:58;33:01;"I'd like to say I'm pretty good at calling people down."
33:01;33:03;"Like, that's one of my specialties in there,"
33:03;33:06;"is, like, if you come at me with a bad tone"
33:06;33:08;"or you're freaking out or you just want, like,"
33:08;33:10;"your phone fixed or replaced,"
33:10;33:12;"I'm gonna immediately just, like, bring you down"
33:12;33:15;"to another level and be like, ""Hey, we got two options."
33:15;33:18;"""You can either go somewhere else or I can help you out,"
33:18;33:20;"and we're gonna be adults about this."""
33:20;33:22;"You seem super chill."
33:22;33:24;"Yeah, you seem like a mellow dude, so..."
33:24;33:26;"Yeah, I try to stay that way."
33:26;33:29;"Do you have to address people as, like, ""Sir"" and ""Ma'am""?"
33:29;33:32;"Like, if somebody's, like, freaking out, are you just like, ""Sir""?"
33:32;33:34;"[laughing]"
33:34;33:36;"""Sir, we both want to fix this iPad."""
33:36;33:38;"We're on the same team here."
33:38;33:40;"""Sir, we're on the same--"
33:40;33:43;"""Ma'am, it's not my fault you didn't update your iOS for five years."
33:43;33:46;"""We're gonna get through this, but, ma'am, I--"""
33:46;33:48;"Do you use those words, ""Sir"" and ""Ma'am""?"
33:48;33:50;"[laughing] I don't."
33:50;33:52;"We got, like, on our iPads, we got, like,"
33:52;33:54;"all the information about the person,"
33:54;33:56;"so I, like, I know what they're wearing,"
33:56;33:58;"I have their full name and everything, so it's like--"
33:58;34:00;"What do you mean you know what they're--"
34:00;34:02;"Back up. Back up. What do you mean you know what they're wearing?"
34:02;34:04;"Like, it says on the iPad-- Because--"
34:04;34:06;"Yeah, that's how you gotta find people in the store, you know?"
34:06;34:09;"Everyone comes in, and they're like, ""Where do we find everyone?"""
34:09;34:12;"It's like, we gotta address you by the clothes that you're wearing."
34:12;34:15;"You got a black T-shirt, you know, blue jeans, whatever,"
34:15;34:18;"and that's how we find you, 'cause they all just come in,"
34:18;34:20;"they just stand there, and they're like, ""What do I do?"""
34:20;34:22;"There's no sign, there's no aisle."
34:22;34:24;"Right. I'm lost."
34:24;34:27;"I was in an Apple store in Pasadena recently,"
34:27;34:29;"and I hadn't been into a store in years,"
34:29;34:32;"and someone--you know, there's, like, the greeter in front"
34:32;34:36;"who took my name, and then I kinda loitered and hung out,"
34:36;34:38;"and then this dude came out of nowhere,"
34:38;34:40;"and this was, like, a super-crowded store."
34:40;34:43;"There was, like, 80 customers in the store,"
34:43;34:45;"and this dude made, like, a beeline towards me."
34:45;34:48;"Oh, because the person wrote down what you were wearing?"
34:48;34:51;"Yeah, he's wearing, like, a Grateful Dead T-shirt."
34:51;34:53;"A super-mellow Caucasian male,"
34:53;34:56;"approximately 40 years old, Grateful Dead T-shirt."
34:56;34:57;"[laughs]"
34:57;34:59;"Is that what it says on the iPad?"
34:59;35:01;"""Reeking of weed."" No, I'm kidding."
35:01;35:03;"Oh, that's great. Yeah, it's pretty close."
35:03;35:05;"But I wondered. I was like, ""How did--"""
35:05;35:07;"I didn't ask the guy, but I wondered."
35:07;35:09;"I was like, ""Why is this guy making a beeline towards me?"""
35:09;35:11;"Now I know. Now you know. Now you know."

36:25;36:26;"- Mm-hmm, yep."
36:26;36:27;"- So you're 24."
36:27;36:29;"So that means that you were born"
36:29;36:32;"like way before Kid Rock was a household name."
36:32;36:33;"So I'm just like curious,"
36:33;36:34;"like when he started getting really big,"
36:34;36:35;"how old were you?"
36:35;36:36;"Do you have memories of it?"
36:36;36:37;"- Oh yeah."
36:37;36:40;"I remember shooting the ""Only God Knows Why"" video"
36:40;36:42;"and I was like on his shoulders, super small."
36:42;36:44;"And I remember like sitting in front of the TV,"
36:44;36:48;"like here's Eminem and then there's my dad on TRL"
36:48;36:49;"and I thought it was so cool."
36:49;36:51;"- You were right along with him for the ride,"
36:51;36:53;"taking it all in real time."
36:53;36:54;"- Oh yeah, every step."
36:54;36:57;"I mean, I went to every show I could"
36:57;37:00;"and had my big red headphones on and--"
37:00;37:01;"- Oh right, that's the classic look,"
37:01;37:03;"the child of the musician"
37:03;37:07;"with like the giant like gardener style."
37:07;37:09;"- Oh, like deeply soundproofed."
37:09;37:10;"- Yeah, because you gotta wear those,"
37:10;37:11;"'cause you're like a little kid,"
37:11;37:13;"you can't be so loud."
37:13;37:14;"- And I'd be like at his shows,"
37:14;37:17;"playing my Game Boy like in the middle,"
37:17;37:19;"in the sound booth, in like the middle of the crowd"
37:19;37:20;"and everyone just be looking at her like,"
37:20;37:21;"what is this kid doing?"
37:21;37:25;"And then I'd like fall asleep like halfway through."
37:25;37:26;"I remember being in the studio,"
37:26;37:30;"like playing Mario Kart 64 when it came out"
37:30;37:32;"and like he was just like in there"
37:32;37:33;"recording every single day"
37:33;37:36;"and he'd be like, ""Bud, just go play some games."""
37:36;37:39;"And you know, it was just kind of a cool time"
37:39;37:42;"to like see him like work really hard,"
37:42;37:43;"get to where he's at."
37:43;37:45;"- So you followed in his footsteps now,"
37:45;37:47;"that you're kind of beginning a music career."
37:47;37:49;"Obviously your music's pretty different"
37:49;37:50;"from your dad's in some ways,"
37:50;37:52;"although you know, over the course of his career,"
37:52;37:53;"he's like done a lot of different things."
37:53;37:54;"Like do you feel the need"
37:54;37:57;"to kind of like differentiate yourselves"
37:57;38:00;"or like do you see that being the son of Kid Rock,"
38:00;38:02;"does that influence your music in any way?"
38:02;38:04;"- I don't think it influences my music,"
38:04;38:07;"'cause I've always, always had like a different taste"
38:07;38:09;"in music than what he's had."
38:09;38:12;"And he's just been like evolving year after year."
38:12;38:15;"And it's kind of weird because I feel like"
38:15;38:19;"I've stayed in the same place as like Devil Without a Cause."
38:19;38:23;"Like that was just such a good record."
38:23;38:25;"And I remember being like young and didn't really know it,"
38:25;38:27;"but when I grew older, like I listened to it"
38:27;38:30;"and I was like, I love this and I love hip hop."
38:30;38:34;"And then I got more into pop once I started to sing"
38:34;38:36;"and I think that's just kind of where I lie"
38:36;38:38;"is between those two realms."
38:38;38:42;"- So we were just talking about like your memories"
38:42;38:44;"of kind of like the changes that went through your dad's life"
38:44;38:46;"as his music career took off."
38:46;38:49;"So one thing that we're curious about is that,"
38:49;38:51;"so now there's these kind of like rumors or this buzz"
38:51;38:53;"that maybe he's entering yet another phase of his career,"
38:53;38:56;"which is politics."
38:56;38:58;"So have you been along for the ride so long"
38:58;39:01;"that having like your dad go from music into politics"
39:01;39:03;"is like par for the course"
39:03;39:06;"or is like, is this something that you guys talk about?"
39:06;39:09;"Like, I mean, has music prepared you to possibly be like"
39:09;39:11;"on the periphery of like a political campaign?"
39:11;39:14;"- Oh man, that's a big question."
39:14;39:16;"I feel like everything that he's done in his life"
39:16;39:18;"has kind of been unexpected."
39:18;39:20;"You know, there's not like a written handbook"
39:20;39:22;"or anything that's followed."
39:22;39:26;"So it's really cool to just like see all this unfold"
39:26;39:28;"and I wouldn't put it past him if he did"
39:28;39:30;"or did not pop into the Senate."
39:30;39:32;"I mean, it's, you kind of weigh the options, you know,"
39:32;39:34;"it'd be something personally,"
39:34;39:37;"I think it would be great to like be a part of like"
39:37;39:41;"that big of a power in like your government,"
39:41;39:42;"but at the same time,"
39:42;39:44;"there's a lot of crap that comes with that."
39:44;39:48;"And I don't know if he will, I don't know."
39:48;39:49;"- Do you follow politics much?"
39:49;39:51;"Like did you, this past election,"
39:51;39:54;"were you like up on it a lot?"
39:54;39:56;"- A little bit, not so much."
39:56;39:58;"I kind of have my views and my thoughts,"
39:58;40:01;"but it's, I just try to stay away from it"
40:01;40:06;"and, you know, I feel like if I'm doing a music career,"
40:06;40:08;"that's kind of something that I just need to,"
40:08;40:10;"you know, everyone has opinions."
40:10;40:14;"And so I understand that like when you stand for something,"
40:14;40:15;"it's great, but at the same time,"
40:15;40:17;"you might be dividing people."
40:17;40:20;"And I kind of just want to take my career,"
40:20;40:23;"I think would just be in a different path of just like,"
40:23;40:26;"hey, let's focus on maybe not politics."
40:26;40:29;"And I know that's very important,"
40:29;40:33;"but I kind of just want to focus on positivity of like life"
40:33;40:35;"and helping people out, making good music."
40:35;40:37;"Hey, that's cool if that's what you want to do,"
40:37;40:40;"but man, that's not for me."
40:40;40:43;"- So we're not going to catch you on Fox News being like,"
40:43;40:46;"so Senator Kid Rock announced a proposal this morning."
40:46;40:49;"RJ, will you please explain this to us?"
40:49;40:49;"- Yeah."
40:49;40:51;"- Yeah, I'll just start singing."
40:51;40:52;"(laughing)"
40:52;40:53;"I'll hold the mic."
40:53;40:55;"- I think that's the way of,"
40:55;40:58;"unless you want a full-time job as a spokesperson."
40:58;41:00;"I wonder if your dad would cut his hair."
41:00;41:02;"- Oh, that's a good question."
41:02;41:04;"- If he was running slash elected,"
41:04;41:05;"that'd be kind of interesting,"
41:05;41:09;"the first like goateed long hair dude."
41:09;41:12;"- Yeah, 'cause senators never have long hair."
41:12;41:14;"- Wear like a suit."
41:14;41:15;"- I don't know if I'd want to see that."
41:15;41:17;"- Wait, yeah, in your entire life."
41:17;41:20;"- I almost feel like your dad's kind of like a Samson."
41:20;41:22;"Like if you cut his hair, he wouldn't be Kid Rock."
41:22;41:25;"- Wait, do you have any, has your dad had a buzz cut ever?"
41:25;41:28;"- No, he just had the high top fade when he was younger."
41:28;41:30;"I got so many pictures of that."
41:30;41:33;"- Right, the kind of like early hip hop days."
41:33;41:36;"So you're almost your entire life, your dad had long hair."
41:36;41:41;"- First time I heard your dad's music was 1997."
41:41;41:46;"I was in a drive-through at Taco Bell in Beaverton, Oregon,"
41:46;41:48;"and a buddy of mine threw in a tape"
41:48;41:50;"and the song was called (beep) in your mouth."
41:50;41:52;"(laughing)"
41:52;41:55;"You would have been about four, I guess."
41:55;41:56;"- I was surprised."
41:56;41:56;"- Oh yeah."
41:56;41:57;"- 'Cause that's deep."
41:57;41:59;"That was still, he wasn't big."
41:59;42:01;"- No, no, no, I remember my buddy being like,"
42:01;42:03;"this is like this white rapper from Michigan."
42:03;42:04;"And I was like, what?"
42:04;42:07;"- You're familiar very early."
42:07;42:08;"- Oh yeah."
42:08;42:09;"- That's such a funny record."
42:09;42:12;"And he did that at Woodstock."
42:12;42:13;"- That's gnarly."
42:13;42:15;"- Were you at Woodstock 99, RJ?"
42:15;42:17;"- Yeah, I was so young."
42:17;42:20;"I don't think I was, if I was there, I don't remember."
42:20;42:22;"- Let's hope you weren't from what I heard"
42:22;42:24;"about Woodstock 99."
42:24;42:26;"So RJ, what kind of music do you listen to now?"
42:26;42:29;"Obviously you grew up with like a lot of music around."
42:29;42:31;"Do you have like specific tastes now?"
42:31;42:33;"Like what have you been listening to lately?"
42:33;42:34;"- Oh man, yeah."
42:34;42:38;"I love pop and hip hop right now."
42:38;42:40;"I'm just like immersed in it."
42:40;42:42;"I still listen to Michael Jackson on the regular."
42:42;42:43;"- Okay, straight up."
42:43;42:44;"- At least once a week."
42:44;42:47;"Love my Bruno Mars and some Weekends."
42:47;42:49;"- So not a lot of rock and country it sounds like."
42:49;42:53;"- No, I didn't get hit with that gene."
42:53;42:54;"- No Bob Seger?"
42:54;42:56;"- I'll jam a little Bob Seger."
42:56;42:58;"There's a couple songs."
42:58;43:00;"(imitates Bob Seger)"
43:00;43:01;"- Oh yeah, okay."
43:01;43:02;"- I like Bob Seger."
43:02;43:04;"(both laugh)"
43:04;43:06;"Yeah, I love hip hop."
43:06;43:07;"I like the good rap though."
43:07;43:11;"And I don't know if I can like handle any more"
43:11;43:15;"of like the mumbling and just like saying whatever"
43:15;43:17;"on tracks and like, I can't understand you."
43:17;43:20;"Like I miss just like the old school,"
43:20;43:23;"like hardcore rap where people were just spitting."
43:23;43:24;"People are still spitting."
43:24;43:26;"Like I love Kendrick's new album."
43:26;43:27;"That was awesome."
43:27;43:28;"- Is he one of your favorite rappers now?"
43:28;43:30;"- Yeah, for sure."
43:30;43:32;"- Cool, well, so speaking of music, RJ,"
43:32;43:34;"we wanna play some of your music."
43:34;43:35;"So we were gonna play ""Moonlight."""
43:35;43:37;"You wanna tell us something about the song?"
43:37;43:40;"- I just got the hook for like a year"
43:40;43:44;"and figured I'd get a girl to sing on it,"
43:44;43:45;"close friend Bailey."
43:45;43:48;"And it's just a fun, upbeat kind of song."
43:48;43:51;"You just wanna be outside on a rooftop at night"
43:51;43:54;"with your girl and just dancing."
43:54;43:55;"- Love it."
43:55;43:56;"Well, thanks so much for talking to us, RJ."
43:56;43:58;"We hope you'll call in again."
43:58;43:58;"- Yeah."
43:58;44:01;"- Anybody who's going to get a broken iPad fixed"
44:01;44:03;"in the Nashville area, you watch your mouth"
44:03;44:05;"'cause those are people too."
44:05;44:07;"So sir and ma'am, keep it in check."
44:07;44:09;"Awesome having you on and here's ""Moonlight."""
44:09;44:10;"- Appreciate it."
44:10;44:11;"- All right, thanks, dude."
44:11;44:12;"Great talking to you. - Bye."
44:12;44:13;"- Good talking to you too."

47:53;47:54;"Spawn, one."
47:54;47:57;"That's RJ Richie with Moonlight."
47:57;47:58;"He's a nice guy."
47:58;47:59;"Yeah, chill, dude."
47:59;48:03;"We have to point out that on Time Crisis, we can never endorse a Republican run for"
48:03;48:04;"the Senate."
48:04;48:05;"Absolutely not."
48:05;48:06;"That's not our values."
48:06;48:07;"That said--"
48:07;48:08;"I wonder why-- well, go ahead."
48:08;48:10;"I said, we knew that we were going to talk to RJ."
48:10;48:11;"Yeah."
48:11;48:13;"Obviously, the interview should be about him."
48:13;48:16;"But of course, the Kid Rock Senate runs on me in the background."
48:16;48:17;"But it's like--"
48:17;48:18;"Yeah."
48:18;48:20;"I didn't want to put him on the spot to be like--"
48:20;48:21;"Yeah, right."
48:21;48:23;"Yeah, because also, like-- because that's whack, too."
48:23;48:26;"It's like, I think he was kind of gently alluding to the fact that, like, obviously,"
48:26;48:28;"he's his own person with his own values."
48:28;48:32;"That said, maybe as a follow-up, we should get Kid Rock on the show."
48:32;48:34;"And we're bringing it."
48:34;48:37;"If you're running for Senate as a Republican, we're going to bring it."
48:37;48:38;"I'd love to hear his positions."
48:38;48:44;"I mean, it's hard to imagine him being super conservative on social issues."
48:44;48:47;"He did write the song, [BLEEP] Your Mouth."
48:47;48:48;"Right."
48:48;48:50;"Maybe he's one of those guys that's like, you know what?"
48:50;48:52;"I'm a self-made entrepreneur."
48:52;48:56;"I saw, like, the welfare state destroying people's motivation."
48:56;48:57;"He's like one of those kind of guys."
48:57;48:58;"I'm curious."
48:58;49:01;"I wonder what his-- why Republican."
49:01;49:03;"Maybe he's super Second Amendment."
49:03;49:04;"I don't know."
49:04;49:08;"You know, I would just hope, though, if you're like some kind of, like, badass musician,"
49:08;49:10;"like, run as an independent."
49:10;49:11;"You know what I'm saying?"
49:11;49:14;"Anyway, so Jake, you've been getting so many listener emails lately."
49:14;49:15;"I know."
49:15;49:19;"We can't possibly get into all of them, but we always take a look at just about everyone"
49:19;49:20;"that comes in."
49:20;49:21;"So everybody writes in."
49:21;49:22;"We really appreciate it."
49:22;49:28;"Man, we've been getting listener emails from Brazil, Germany, Spain, Canada."
49:28;49:29;"It's an excellent one."
49:29;49:34;"It kind of ties into-- at least in my mind, it ties into the Game of Thrones connection."
49:34;49:35;"Oh, yeah."
49:35;49:36;"Led Zeppelin."
49:36;49:37;"Very Game of Thrones vibe."
49:37;49:38;"Yeah, the lyrics."
49:38;49:39;"Oh, yeah."
49:39;49:40;"So, yeah, read the email, Jake."
49:40;49:41;"OK, this email."
49:41;49:46;"Mr. Longstreth, sorry to bother you in a personal email, but I didn't know how else to contact"
49:46;49:47;"you."
49:47;49:51;"As an avid Time Crisis listener, this email is bugging me for some time, and I had to"
49:51;49:53;"get it off my chest."
49:53;49:56;"My name is Dipnashu Gupta."
49:56;49:59;"Never mind if you can't pronounce it right."
49:59;50:03;"And I'm a physics master's from India, but currently living in Germany."
50:03;50:04;"Oh, OK."
50:04;50:06;"I don't know what physics master's is."
50:06;50:08;"Maybe I can get a master's degree in physics."
50:08;50:11;"Yeah, you could say, oh, my God, I'm a physics master's."
50:11;50:13;"Like, I'm a physics PhD."
50:13;50:15;"OK, I got you."
50:15;50:19;"I feel like this show sorely lacks a non-American perspective and taste on music."
50:19;50:24;"And someone who's never been in America more than a childhood vacation to Disneyland, here's"
50:24;50:25;"my story."
50:25;50:30;"Being an outsider from all pop culture phenomena that pervades through your country, I've had"
50:30;50:32;"a unique introduction to music."
50:32;50:37;"I didn't even listen to my first international track before I was in the 10th grade, 15 years"
50:37;50:38;"of age."
50:38;50:43;"My initial listening encompassed pop hits of the day, breezy new metal bands like Linkin"
50:43;50:46;"Park and commercial rap acts like Eminem."
50:46;50:52;"I wouldn't describe Linkin Park as breezy, but I'm not going to nitpick."
50:52;50:57;"It remained this way until one fine day I saw a cover by Miley Cyrus of an eclectic"
50:57;51:00;"and intriguing song called ""Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You."""
51:00;51:02;"And I was like, wow, what is that?"
51:02;51:04;"I've never heard anything like that."
51:04;51:10;"A bit of digging led to, pun intended, me to discover the Led Zeppelin ""One"" album,"
51:10;51:13;"and its vibrant rock song left a deep impression on me."
51:13;51:17;"I had heard ""Stairway"" before, but it did not influence me in a major way."
51:17;51:21;"The guitar riffs were so soulful and loud at the same time."
51:21;51:25;"I went through a rite of passage, one album after another, each album holds something"
51:25;51:26;"special for me."
51:26;51:32;"I could ramble on, another pun, about how this led me to discover other great artists"
51:32;51:37;"like the Beatles, Van Morrison, and The Who being prominent ones, but I'd like to cut"
51:37;51:39;"to the chase here."
51:39;51:44;"You speak so much about the tasteful palette of 70s rock, but why don't you ever talk"
51:44;51:45;"about Led Zeppelin?"
51:45;51:52;"They were inarguably, yes, not even inarguably, the band that defined the decade and influenced"
51:52;51:54;"music to come for generations."
51:54;51:56;"Soulful sitar tracks?"
51:56;51:57;"Done."
51:57;51:59;"Loudest riffs you'll ever hear?"
51:59;52:00;"Done."
52:00;52:03;"Brilliant songwriting and the second greatest guitarist of all time?"
52:03;52:05;"Can't forget about Jimi Hendrix."
52:05;52:08;"Churning out epic solos out of the back of his hand?"
52:08;52:09;"Check."
52:09;52:13;"Yes, the show is on the lighter side of things with all the fun things in life, Curb, and"
52:13;52:14;"Seinfeld."
52:14;52:18;"It just plain disheartens me to see the greatest band of all time go unmentioned every time"
52:18;52:20;"we talk about 70s rock."
52:20;52:27;"Maybe it's too much to ask, but can we have an episode where you guys talk about Led Zeppelin?"
52:27;52:28;"Great email."
52:28;52:29;"Wow."
52:29;52:31;"That was a tour de force."
52:31;52:34;"I love someone going to bat for Zeppelin."
52:34;52:35;"I know."
52:35;52:37;"As if it's some obscure band."
52:37;52:38;"I mean, he's right though."
52:38;52:39;"You know what?"
52:39;52:40;"Unsung heroes, Led Zeppelin."
52:40;52:44;"We talk so much about 70s rock on this show, we almost never talk about Zeppelin."
52:44;52:50;"I gotta say, it's also like, you know, it's a good story to remember perspective too."
52:50;52:51;"Right."
52:51;52:53;"Like, you grew up in America."
52:53;52:54;"Yeah."
52:54;52:56;"Classic rock radio."
52:56;53:01;"If you listen to classic rock radio, if your parents listen to that type of music, which"
53:01;53:04;"is a very large percentage of the country, you're just familiar."
53:04;53:05;"You at least know the name Led Zeppelin."
53:05;53:08;"Even via hip hop, Led Zeppelin gets sampled a lot."
53:08;53:09;"It's just part, you know, whatever."
53:09;53:10;"They were big in America."
53:10;53:16;"And it's kind of amazing to like, remember that this dude growing up in a different culture,"
53:16;53:20;"he's saying he didn't even hear anything outside of Indian music until he was 15."
53:20;53:21;"Right."
53:21;53:27;"That for him, you know, by like kind of guitar store, like rock dude vibe, it's like to get"
53:27;53:30;"into the Zeppelin off of Miley Cyrus cover is like, what?"
53:30;53:33;"And then it's like, well, yeah, check yourself, man."
53:33;53:37;"Not everybody like grew up with Led Zeppelin blasting on mic."
53:37;53:38;"Right."
53:38;53:39;"I'm running with a big dog radio."
53:39;53:40;"Yeah."
53:40;53:44;"Or like not everyone had the like kid that was like four years older than you that lived"
53:44;53:45;"down the street."
53:45;53:46;"Like a stoner older brother."
53:46;53:48;"It was like, ""Houses of the Holy Dude."""
53:48;53:49;"You gotta listen to this."
53:49;53:58;"In fact, I'll even go as far to say that our guy, Dibnashu, he's got better taste than"
53:58;54:05;"your average rando punk ass kid who's into Zeppelin in like the late 80s because he heard"
54:05;54:09;"through Miley, he was like, ""That's a good song."""
54:09;54:10;"Yeah."
54:10;54:11;"Pure songwriting."
54:11;54:14;"He was like, ""That's a good song."""
54:14;54:15;"And he got into it."
54:15;54:19;"Like if you're growing up in America and you're at some high school where an older kid was"
54:19;54:24;"into Zeppelin or something, it would already be so contextualized by the fact that you"
54:24;54:29;"thought rock is cool or you thought Jimmy Pate, you'd have so many other signifiers"
54:29;54:30;"to get into Zeppelin."
54:30;54:32;"He's hearing it on like a purely musical level."
54:32;54:36;"I mean, he should probably be an A&R guy."
54:36;54:38;"Divorced from cultural context."
54:38;54:39;"Yeah."
54:39;54:41;"Just imagine like you hear Miley Cyrus sing a Zeppelin tune and just be like, ""Now that's"
54:41;54:42;"a song."
54:42;54:43;"That's a song."
54:43;54:44;"Find me who wrote that song."
54:44;54:45;"I want to sign these guys."""
54:45;54:46;"Page Plant."
54:46;54:47;"Who's that?"
54:47;54:48;"Page Plant?"
54:48;54:49;"Get him in my office."
54:49;54:50;"These fellas can write a tune."
54:51;55:00;"I said, ""Baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you."
55:00;55:15;"I said, ""Baby, you know I'm gonna leave you."
55:15;55:30;"I'm gonna leave you when the summer comes rolling."
55:30;55:50;"I'm gonna leave you when the summer comes rolling."
01:19:30;01:19:40;"Our house is a very, very, very fine house with two cats in the yard."
01:19:40;01:19:50;"Life used to be so hard. Now everything is easy 'cause of you."
01:19:50;01:20:18;"And now..."
01:20:18;01:20:28;"Our house is a very, very, very fine house with two cats in the yard."
01:20:28;01:20:39;"Life used to be so hard. Now everything is easy 'cause of you."
01:20:39;01:21:00;"And now... I'll light the fire while you place the flowers in the vase that you bought today."
01:21:00;01:21:03;"Oh, come on, Crosby. Get it together, man."
01:21:03;01:21:05;"But yeah, on Twitter, always, people ask some questions."
01:21:05;01:21:07;"What do you think of Jim Morrison?"
01:21:07;01:21:09;"Overrated."
01:21:09;01:21:10;"Never liked him."
01:21:11;01:21:12;"Yeah, that's funny."
01:21:12;01:21:13;"That's a pretty tight take, actually."
01:21:13;01:21:14;"Right."
01:21:14;01:21:19;"It's also, like, hilarious, just, like, 50 years later, just talking s*** about one of your peers who died at 27."
01:21:19;01:21:20;"So long ago."
01:21:20;01:21:23;"He sucked."
01:21:23;01:21:25;"Is it time for the Top 5?"
01:21:25;01:21:26;"Yeah."
01:21:26;01:21:32;"It's time for the Top 5 on iTunes."
01:21:32;01:21:42;"All right, Jake, today we're comparing the Top 5 songs on iTunes to the Top 5 Billboard hits of 1991, the year that George R.R. Martin started writing ""Fire and Ice."""
01:21:42;01:21:45;"So, late July '91."
01:21:45;01:21:57;"Late July '91, George R.R. Martin sits down at his word processor, blastin' some Grateful Dead, and begins writing a book that will become a TV show that will change the
world."
01:21:57;01:22:00;"25 years later."
01:22:00;01:22:05;"The number 5 song of '91, this week, Paula Abdul, ""Rush Rush."""
01:22:05;01:22:22;"Good song."
01:22:22;01:22:23;"I don't know if I know--you know this song?"
01:22:23;01:22:24;"Oh, yeah."
01:22:24;01:22:29;"It's a good one."
01:22:29;01:22:33;"Paula is sort of, like, pre-Britney with her vocal fry."
01:22:33;01:22:45;"Yeah, you're right."
01:22:45;01:22:48;"Not quite full voice."
01:22:48;01:22:53;"Right, right, right."
01:22:53;01:22:59;"A lot of other R&B singers would probably be belting this a little more confidently."
01:22:59;01:23:00;"Right, she's not singing loud."
01:23:00;01:23:13;"Yeah."
01:23:13;01:23:17;"This was the big ballad off the ""Forever You're a Girl"" album."
01:23:17;01:23:19;"You're a real Paula Abdul fan, huh?"
01:23:19;01:23:20;"Yeah, well, it was right."
01:23:20;01:23:21;"Perfect timing for me."
01:23:21;01:23:23;"I mean, I was watching a lot of MTV at that point."
01:23:23;01:23:24;"Right."
01:23:24;01:23:27;"And ""Forever You're a Girl"" and ""Straight Up"" were big hits."
01:23:27;01:23:28;"""Straight Up,"" ""Nap Time."""
01:23:28;01:23:29;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:23:29;01:23:30;"And also ""Offices of Tract."""
01:23:30;01:23:31;"With the cartoon."
01:23:31;01:23:32;"Yeah."
01:23:32;01:23:33;"She danced with the cat in the video."
01:23:33;01:23:36;"So the ""Forever You're a Girl"" album was like a--she did a bunch of singles off that record."
01:23:36;01:23:38;"Yeah, she was a great dancer."
01:23:38;01:23:39;"Former Laker girl."
01:23:39;01:23:40;"Right."
01:23:40;01:23:42;"Soft spot in my heart for those singles."
01:23:42;01:23:45;"""Forever You're a Girl"" is a great album title."
01:23:45;01:23:46;"Great song."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"What year was she born?"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"Paula Abdul was born in 1962."
01:23:58;01:24:01;"Okay, so she was 29 here."
01:24:01;01:24:05;"So, oh, Paula Abdul is a Syrian Jew."
01:24:05;01:24:06;"I didn't know that."
01:24:06;01:24:08;"I wonder if she's still in L.A."
01:24:08;01:24:10;"Oh, yeah, she's definitely still in L.A."
01:24:10;01:24:11;"What's her day-to-day?"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"You know, also a Syrian Jew is Jerry Seinfeld."
01:24:13;01:24:14;"Oh, really?"
01:24:14;01:24:17;"He can trace some of his heritage back to Syria."
01:24:17;01:24:19;"When's he going to weigh in?"
01:24:19;01:24:21;"We should have Paula call in."
01:24:21;01:24:22;"I'd love to have Paula call in."
01:24:22;01:24:23;"Paula, what's your day-to-day?"
01:24:23;01:24:24;"She went to Van Nuys High School."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"What, did you know she was on, like, ""American Idol"" for a while and stuff?"
01:24:26;01:24:27;"Oh, that's right."
01:24:27;01:24:30;"I love that Jake's got a soft spot for Paula Abdul."
01:24:30;01:24:31;"I do."
01:24:31;01:24:32;"What about the number five today?"
01:24:32;01:24:34;"Shawn Mendes, the Caucasian Canadian."
01:24:34;01:24:35;"Oh, yeah."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"Canada's second most famous Caucasian."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"Very passionate music."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"Is that the same song we heard last week?"
01:24:49;01:24:50;"I think so, yeah."
01:24:52;01:24:54;"There's nothing holding me back."
01:24:59;01:25:00;"Oh, yeah."
01:25:08;01:25:11;"I like those, ""Mm, mm, mm."""
01:25:11;01:25:12;"Pretty jolly."
01:25:21;01:25:22;"You like that rock?"
01:25:22;01:25:23;"It's kind of crazy."
01:25:24;01:25:25;"Just the hand claps."
01:25:25;01:25:28;"[claps]"
01:25:28;01:25:30;"My inhibitions."
01:25:30;01:25:31;"That's pretty rock."
01:25:31;01:25:32;"Yeah."
01:25:32;01:25:34;"What, Canadians can't make rock?"
01:25:34;01:25:36;"I didn't say that."
01:25:36;01:25:38;"The number four song."
01:25:38;01:25:39;"I got to know this."
01:25:39;01:25:40;"Shawn Mendes is--"
01:25:40;01:25:41;"Yeah, that sucks."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"Oh, I wasn't going to say that, but--"
01:25:42;01:25:43;"It sucks."
01:25:43;01:25:44;"Okay."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"Jury's out."
01:25:45;01:25:47;"Oh, this is a good song."
01:25:47;01:25:50;"The number four song in summer '91."
01:25:50;01:25:53;"DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, ""Summertime."""
01:26:00;01:26:02;"Song sample is ""Summer Madness"" by Kool and the Gang."
01:26:02;01:26:03;"Great song."
01:26:29;01:26:34;"I feel like Will Smith, he certainly did invent this flow."
01:26:34;01:26:38;"[singing]"
01:26:38;01:26:41;"What was the last big Will Smith hit?"
01:26:41;01:26:42;"Like a true hit?"
01:26:42;01:26:43;"Yeah."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"I don't know."
01:26:45;01:26:47;"""Here Come the Men in Black."""
01:26:47;01:26:48;"[singing]"
01:26:48;01:26:51;"Like that kind of era."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"Late '90s."
01:26:53;01:26:55;"Late '90s."
01:26:55;01:27:00;"[singing]"
01:27:00;01:27:03;"So that was probably '99, yeah."
01:27:03;01:27:05;"You know, you can't say anything bad about ""Summertime."""
01:27:05;01:27:06;"No."
01:27:06;01:27:14;"The number four song in our era, 2017, ""Charlie Puth."""
01:27:14;01:27:16;"That's what happened last time."
01:27:16;01:27:17;"Yeah, now, I remember--"
01:27:17;01:27:20;"Charlie Puth, that name is funny."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"What's funny about it?"
01:27:21;01:27:24;"You know, man, you keep implying that the name Charlie Puth is funny."
01:27:24;01:27:25;"What's funny about it?"
01:27:25;01:27:28;"It's not like it sounds like anything."
01:27:28;01:27:29;"No, it doesn't, right?"
01:27:29;01:27:30;"Does it?"
01:27:30;01:27:31;"Not really."
01:27:31;01:27:32;"What?"
01:27:32;01:27:33;"Puth heads?"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"His fans are called Puthinators?"
01:27:35;01:27:36;"That's cool."
01:27:36;01:27:37;"That's so dumb."
01:27:37;01:27:38;"Why is that dumb?"
01:27:38;01:27:39;"It's the worst."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"Why?"
01:27:40;01:27:41;"How is that less dumb?"
01:27:41;01:27:43;"It's a dumb pun on Terminator."
01:27:43;01:27:44;"That's dumb."
01:27:44;01:27:46;"But was Deadhead dumb?"
01:27:46;01:27:47;"Deadhead's original."
01:27:47;01:27:48;"What's original about it?"
01:27:48;01:27:50;"There wasn't Buddy Holly heads."
01:27:50;01:27:51;"There wasn't Beatles heads."
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Deadheads."
01:27:52;01:27:53;"It rhymes."
01:27:54;01:27:55;"Deadheads."
01:27:55;01:27:58;"It's like original-- you know, that's where the term head comes from."
01:27:58;01:27:59;"Is it really?"
01:27:59;01:28:00;"It didn't exist before?"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"Are you sure?"
01:28:01;01:28:02;"No, I'm not sure."
01:28:02;01:28:05;"I bet it existed before Deadheads."
01:28:05;01:28:06;"I don't think so, dude."
01:28:06;01:28:07;"What, pothead?"
01:28:07;01:28:10;"Yeah, jazz musicians."
01:28:10;01:28:12;"Okay, whatever, man."
01:28:12;01:28:17;"I'm just saying, like, so Deadhead is cool because it rhymes, but Puthinators is dumb"
01:28:17;01:28:18;"because it's a pun?"
01:28:18;01:28:19;"So I just want to understand."
01:28:19;01:28:24;"In Jake's world view, rhyming is cool, puns suck."
01:28:24;01:28:26;"That's not what I'm saying."
01:28:26;01:28:29;"Deadhead was created whole cloth."
01:28:29;01:28:34;"Maybe it came from pothead, but they took it from a drug context to a band context,"
01:28:34;01:28:37;"taking it from, like, a bad '80s action movie to a band pun."
01:28:37;01:28:39;"Weak."
01:28:39;01:28:40;"Weak."
01:28:40;01:28:41;"You follow my logic."
01:28:41;01:28:43;"First of all, Terminator's a good movie."
01:28:43;01:28:45;"First of all."
01:28:45;01:28:47;"I want to show solidarity with the Puthinators."
01:28:47;01:28:48;"Agree to disagree."
01:28:48;01:28:50;"Let's agree to disagree."
01:28:50;01:28:51;"Puthinators."
01:28:51;01:28:53;"We heard this one last time, too."
01:28:53;01:29:04;"I think you like this song, Jake."
01:29:04;01:29:05;"Did I?"
01:29:05;01:29:14;"Is he Canadian, kid?"
01:29:14;01:29:16;"No, he's American."
01:29:17;01:29:21;"I know that dress is carnal, perfume regret."
01:29:21;01:29:25;"You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine."
01:29:25;01:29:31;"And now I'm all up on you, what you expect?"
01:29:31;01:29:35;"But you're not coming home with me tonight."
01:29:35;01:29:37;"You just want attention."
01:29:37;01:29:38;"Oh, the bass."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"Oh, yeah."
01:29:40;01:29:41;"We like this song."
01:29:41;01:29:44;"You just hate the thought of me with someone else."
01:29:44;01:29:45;"So RHCP."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"You just want attention."
01:29:47;01:29:49;"I knew from the start."
01:29:49;01:29:51;"Demo, demo, demo, demo, in down."
01:29:51;01:29:53;"Leave the lawn to say the ball, eh."
01:29:53;01:29:56;"Pumped in pain and flame and now I'm laid down."
01:29:56;01:29:59;"Run around, run around, run around, throwing that dirt all on money."
01:29:59;01:30:04;"Do you think the bass player had it strung up super high or super low?"
01:30:04;01:30:05;"I don't know."
01:30:05;01:30:07;"Above or below the--"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"It honestly might even just be samples."
01:30:09;01:30:10;"Oh, I'm sure."
01:30:10;01:30:12;"It's a MIDI keyboard."
01:30:12;01:30:13;"OK."
01:30:13;01:30:15;"You got to give it up for that."
01:30:15;01:30:16;"Puthenator's going wild."
01:30:16;01:30:19;"I think we got a new Puthenator in the building."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"From dead end to Puthenator."
01:30:21;01:30:22;"There are not Puthenators."
01:30:22;01:30:24;"That's not a thing."
01:30:24;01:30:26;"He's an extremely popular singer-songwriter."
01:30:26;01:30:27;"Staple Center?"
01:30:27;01:30:29;"Where's he going to play when he comes to?"
01:30:29;01:30:30;"Hollywood Bowl?"
01:30:30;01:30:31;"He might do--"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"Puth's show at the Hollywood Bowl."
01:30:33;01:30:34;"Puthenators are coming out."
01:30:34;01:30:37;"A guy like Charlie Puth is probably making so much money off his writing,"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"he probably doesn't feel the need to go tour the world,"
01:30:39;01:30:41;"but he could probably do Staple Center at this point."
01:30:41;01:30:43;"The robes that Puthenator's rolling in."
01:30:43;01:30:44;"That's right."
01:30:44;01:30:46;"All the deep cuts."
01:30:46;01:30:48;"They got the box set."
01:30:48;01:30:50;"There's no box set yet."
01:30:50;01:30:53;"The number three song in '91."
01:30:53;01:30:55;"Remember this one, ""EMF""?"
01:30:55;01:30:57;"Oh, yeah."
01:30:57;01:30:58;"Good one."
01:30:58;01:31:02;"It's a good song."
01:31:02;01:31:03;"What would happen to ""EMF""?"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"They had a couple of songs in this era,"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"and then they just went away."
01:31:07;01:31:09;"I'm sure much bigger in the UK."
01:31:23;01:31:25;"I love this guy's voice."
01:31:48;01:31:50;"Very early '90s."
01:31:50;01:31:51;"That song came out in 1990."
01:31:51;01:31:53;"Wow."
01:31:53;01:31:57;"Jake, I just got some info about Charlie Puth's touring,"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"in case you want to know how many Puthenators there are."
01:31:59;01:32:00;"Yeah?"
01:32:00;01:32:02;"He's on tour with Shawn Mendes right now."
01:32:02;01:32:03;"Ooh."
01:32:03;01:32:05;"And they're playing arenas across the country."
01:32:05;01:32:06;"Wow."
01:32:06;01:32:10;"They're probably selling 10,000 to 15,000 tickets in most major markets,"
01:32:10;01:32:14;"at least, and they might even be doing multiple nights."
01:32:14;01:32:22;"And I'm just this 40-year-old jack-off on this dumb show,"
01:32:22;01:32:24;"making fun of the Puthenators."
01:32:24;01:32:26;"They're just crushing it."
01:32:26;01:32:27;"That's right."
01:32:27;01:32:32;"Night in, night out, across the country."
01:32:32;01:32:34;"They're in Tampa tonight."
01:32:34;01:32:35;"Yeah."
01:32:35;01:32:38;"12,000 tickets sold."
01:32:38;01:32:44;"Just playing at the Chipotle Dome."
01:32:44;01:32:47;"Dear Charlie Puth, my name is Jake Longstreth."
01:32:47;01:32:50;"You might not know me, but I certainly know you."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"[laughter]"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"I've been listening to your voice--"
01:32:54;01:32:55;"Where is this going?"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"--since the Paul Walker song,"
01:32:57;01:33:01;"and commenting on it, often in a mean-spirited way,"
01:33:01;01:33:04;"on the hit radio show Time Crisis."
01:33:04;01:33:10;"I use the term ""hit"" very liberally."
01:33:10;01:33:13;"I did not respect you, nor your artistry,"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"and I certainly did not respect the Puthenators."
01:33:15;01:33:18;"However, since being informed of your tour schedule,"
01:33:18;01:33:21;"it's time for me to man up and admit that I was wrong."
01:33:21;01:33:22;"The people have spoken."
01:33:22;01:33:24;"[laughter]"
01:33:24;01:33:25;"The people have spoken."
01:33:25;01:33:29;"Mr. Puth, I formally renounce my life as a deadhead."
01:33:29;01:33:31;"I pledge myself to you as a Puthenator."
01:33:31;01:33:38;"[laughter]"
01:33:38;01:33:41;"I'll understand if you never want to hear from me again."
01:33:41;01:33:44;"But just know that when you set out multiple nights"
01:33:44;01:33:47;"at the Staples Center, I'll be there."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"Good luck with the show, man. Tallahassee."
01:33:49;01:33:53;"[laughter]"
01:33:53;01:33:58;"That's very big of you, Jake, to write that letter to Charlie Puth."
01:33:58;01:34:02;"Charlie Puth, Shawn Mendes, Double Bill."
01:34:02;01:34:04;"Who's headlining?"
01:34:04;01:34:05;"It's a co-headline."
01:34:05;01:34:06;"You get to co-headline."
01:34:06;01:34:07;"They swap."
01:34:07;01:34:09;"Yeah, they're probably swapping."
01:34:09;01:34:11;"I know who Jake likes. You like this one."
01:34:11;01:34:13;"[drums]"
01:34:13;01:34:15;"This is stated up here."

01:39:41;01:39:43;"- Wait, wait, wait, like Alexander Payne?"

01:39:45;01:39:47;"- Uh, could be. Well, he's British."
01:39:47;01:39:49;"So, so far... - God."

01:39:56;01:39:58;"- Yeah."
01:39:58;01:40:00;"- We had Shawn Mendes, who's Canadian."
01:40:00;01:40:03;"We had Charlie Puth, who's American."
01:40:03;01:40:05;"We had Niall Horan, who's..."

01:40:07;01:40:09;"- British? - Can we get a fact check"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"on Niall Horan's nationality?"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"- Seinfeld."
01:40:13;01:40:15;"- Seinfeld. - Irish."
01:40:15;01:40:17;"- Okay. - Northern Ireland"
01:40:17;01:40:19;"or straight-up Ireland? I guess it doesn't matter."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"- So Niall Horan's Irish."
01:40:21;01:40:23;"So we had... - Yeah."
01:40:23;01:40:25;"- We had a Canadian, American, and Irishman."
01:40:25;01:40:27;"And now we have an Englishman."
01:40:27;01:40:29;"Liam Payne. - Not familiar."
01:40:29;01:40:32;"- This is a very young male Caucasian top five."
01:40:32;01:40:34;"You don't know who Liam Payne is."
01:40:34;01:40:36;"- No. Is he One Direction? - Yes."
01:40:36;01:40:38;"- Okay. Of course. - So this is wild, man."
01:40:38;01:40:40;"- What a shocker though. - It's like..."
01:40:40;01:40:42;"So we had Shawn Mendes and Charlie Puth,"
01:40:42;01:40:44;"number five and four, on tour together."
01:40:44;01:40:47;"And then three and two are former members of One Direction."
01:40:47;01:40:50;"Not a ton of variety happening right now."
01:40:50;01:40:53;"- What does that say about people buying these singles?"
01:40:53;01:40:56;"- Well, look, first of all, we've been doing the top five for a long time."
01:40:56;01:41:00;"It's not like it's always, like, 24-year-old white guys, but..."
01:41:00;01:41:03;"- Lining up that way this week. - Yeah, this week it is. I don't know."
01:41:03;01:41:05;"There's just something in the air."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"So Niall Horan, you know, he's the one who loves Don Henley."
01:41:07;01:41:10;"- Oh, yeah. - And he's trying to go Don Henley."
01:41:10;01:41:12;"Liam Payne, he likes more hip-hop,"
01:41:12;01:41:14;"so he got ""Cuevo"" from Migos on his song."

01:50:10;01:50:12;"It's, uh, no, no, the Sheriff of Nottingham."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"Sheriff of Nottingham?"
01:50:14;01:50:16;"Sheriff of Nottingham's played by Jeremy Irons?"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"Yeah. I don't know who it actually is."
01:50:18;01:50:20;"It's like that kind of character actor."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"Sir Lawrence Olivier?"
01:50:22;01:50:24;"Robin Hood."
01:50:24;01:50:26;"Sheriff of Nottingham, you gotta go."
01:50:26;01:50:28;"It's not cool, man."
01:50:28;01:50:31;"I mean, the taxation rates are crazy."

01:50:33;01:50:35;"# I used to be in one deep"
01:50:35;01:50:37;"You gotta go home, but you can't stay here, Sheriff."
01:50:37;01:50:39;"Oh, Alan Rickman is in it?"
01:50:39;01:50:41;"Oh, yeah, Alan Rickman is the Sheriff of Nottingham."
01:50:41;01:50:43;"I forgot that."
01:50:43;01:50:45;"Alan Rickman was on a tear late 80s"
01:50:45;01:50:47;"because he played Hans Gruber in Die Hard."
01:50:47;01:50:49;"Great actor, RIP, man."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"So that was the number one song."
01:50:51;01:50:53;"Everything I Do I Do It For You '91."
01:50:53;01:50:55;"Want to take a wild guess"
01:50:55;01:50:57;"what the number one song on iTunes is right now?"
01:50:57;01:50:59;"July of '91?"
01:50:59;01:51:01;"No, no, that was '91 of 2017."
01:51:01;01:51:03;"Oh, yeah, you're right."
01:51:03;01:51:05;"[laughter]"
01:51:05;01:51:07;"Am I even paying attention right now?"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"Um, Despacito."
01:51:09;01:51:11;"Yes."
01:51:11;01:51:13;"F***ing damn."
01:51:13;01:51:15;"Justin Bieber, you know, he just cancelled"
01:51:15;01:51:17;"the rest of his world tour."
01:51:17;01:51:19;"What happened?"
01:51:19;01:51:21;"He said he wanted to, like..."
01:51:21;01:51:23;"Focus on a solo album?"
01:51:23;01:51:25;"No, he wanted to focus on his relationship with Christ."
01:51:25;01:51:27;"Whoa."
01:51:27;01:51:29;"That's actually an interesting story."
01:51:29;01:51:31;"We have nothing left to say about this song,"
01:51:31;01:51:33;"but he cancelled the tour."
01:51:33;01:51:35;"It wasn't like crazy. He'd already been on tour for a long time."
01:51:35;01:51:37;"People were speculating why,"
01:51:37;01:51:39;"and they kind of gave a vague answer."
01:51:39;01:51:41;"Like, at first he said something about exhaustion,"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"and then he said he pulled the plug"
01:51:43;01:51:45;"because he wanted to..."
01:51:45;01:51:47;"he rededicated his life to Christ."
01:51:47;01:51:49;"I don't know if he actually said that,"
01:51:49;01:51:51;"or if that's somebody from his church said that."
01:51:51;01:51:53;"Like, that's cool."
01:51:53;01:51:55;"I would just love to get some details about that,"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"because obviously there's plenty of Christian music"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"out there,"
01:51:59;01:52:01;"and obviously there's plenty of Christian touring musicians."
01:52:01;01:52:03;"Like, the exhaustion thing,"
01:52:03;01:52:05;"of course, no questions asked."
01:52:05;01:52:07;"If your health or your mental health is..."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"I have questions."
01:52:09;01:52:11;"I mean, that's a general platitude."
01:52:11;01:52:13;"Well, right."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"But look, if somebody says they're exhausted..."
01:52:15;01:52:17;"You checked yourself into the hospital for exhaustion,"
01:52:17;01:52:19;"you're like, ""What?"""
01:52:19;01:52:21;"What about the dude working 80 hours a week"
01:52:21;01:52:23;"at some crap job?"
01:52:23;01:52:25;"That's exhaustion, too."
01:52:25;01:52:27;"When I hear that, I'm just like,"
01:52:27;01:52:29;"""No, I don't buy that."""
01:52:29;01:52:31;"I'm just saying that at least if somebody says exhaustion"
01:52:31;01:52:33;"and you wonder if behind it there's something more serious"
01:52:33;01:52:35;"or there's more to the story,"
01:52:35;01:52:37;"at least you could be like..."
01:52:37;01:52:39;"That's also their way of telling you it's private."
01:52:39;01:52:41;"You know what I mean?"
01:52:41;01:52:43;"And it's kind of like, you should be like,"
01:52:43;01:52:45;"""Okay, maybe you're curious, but it's like,"
01:52:45;01:52:47;"""Okay, you're a human being."
01:52:47;01:52:49;"""Your job is not saving lives."
01:52:49;01:52:51;"""You don't have to go into it."""
01:52:51;01:52:53;"But the rededicating your life to Christ"
01:52:53;01:52:55;"is interesting because there's certainly"
01:52:55;01:52:57;"an evangelical side to Christianity."
01:52:57;01:52:59;"Justin Bieber was raised as an evangelical Christian,"
01:52:59;01:53:01;"so it does kind of beg the question,"
01:53:01;01:53:03;"what aspect of touring"
01:53:03;01:53:05;"affected your relationship"
01:53:05;01:53:07;"to Christ?"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"Because literally, there are people who go on tour"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"to share the message"
01:53:11;01:53:13;"of Christ through the world, right?"
01:53:13;01:53:15;"Many people. So I don't know."
01:53:15;01:53:17;"Obviously, it's personal and it's private,"
01:53:17;01:53:19;"but I'm always"
01:53:19;01:53:21;"very interested in the relationship"
01:53:21;01:53:23;"between religion and music, so I'm just curious."
01:53:23;01:53:25;"Justin Bieber dropped a deeply Christian record."
01:53:25;01:53:27;"Or go on tour"
01:53:27;01:53:29;"and do a Kanye speech"
01:53:29;01:53:31;"in the middle of the tour,"
01:53:31;01:53:33;"except it's just Christian stuff."
01:53:33;01:53:35;"His management would have a heart attack."
01:53:35;01:53:37;"Eh, everybody knows"
01:53:37;01:53:39;"that Justin is of a Christian background."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"It's an interesting conundrum."
01:53:41;01:53:43;"What if he really went"
01:53:43;01:53:45;"deep, deep in"
01:53:45;01:53:47;"and was just like,"
01:53:47;01:53:49;"""I don't care about my career."
01:53:49;01:53:51;"""I gotta spread the good word to the people,"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"""and I'm gonna do a 40-minute"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"""sermon mid-set."""
01:53:55;01:53:57;"I'd be so into that."
01:53:57;01:53:59;"I would love it."
01:53:59;01:54:01;"I'm sure his management would just be like,"
01:54:01;01:54:03;"""Okay, let's explore that."""
01:54:03;01:54:05;"Be like, ""We liked it better when you were getting DUIs, Justin."
01:54:05;01:54:07;"""See? Maybe Kanye"
01:54:07;01:54:09;"was right."""
01:54:09;01:54:11;"I forget what he said."
01:54:11;01:54:13;"He said something about you can rap about anything"
01:54:13;01:54:15;"except for Jesus."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"I don't know."
01:54:17;01:54:19;"That is the most taboo territory"
01:54:19;01:54:21;"for mainstream pop."
01:54:21;01:54:23;"Obviously, the Christian music market's"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"huge, but it's different."
01:54:25;01:54:27;"There's a lot of artists who people know"
01:54:27;01:54:29;"to be Christian, but the music doesn't necessarily"
01:54:29;01:54:31;"have a Christian message."
01:54:31;01:54:33;"Bieber and U2 should hook up."
01:54:33;01:54:35;"Also, apparently, he"
01:54:35;01:54:37;"got a new church"
01:54:37;01:54:39;"that he's a part of. I'm just genuinely curious."
01:54:39;01:54:41;"Maybe he will come out and share this information"
01:54:41;01:54:43;"and be like, ""Okay, guys. I know"
01:54:43;01:54:45;"""that when I canceled the tour and I gave"
01:54:45;01:54:47;"""a reason related to my religion,"
01:54:47;01:54:49;"""some people got it and some people didn't."""
01:54:49;01:54:51;"Well, let me explain."
01:54:51;01:54:53;"Maybe he feels like some of the material"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"doesn't reflect his values."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"That's understandable. That's a classic"
01:54:57;01:54:59;"musician"
01:54:59;01:55:01;"perspective shift."
01:55:01;01:55:03;"People don't want to do secular music anymore."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"Cat Stevens."
01:55:05;01:55:07;"Yeah, Al Green."
01:55:07;01:55:09;"Anyway, Justin, if you ever want to talk"
01:55:09;01:55:11;"about it, call in."
01:55:11;01:55:13;"You know the number."
01:55:13;01:55:15;"You got my number. I don't think you have Ezra's, but you got mine."
01:55:15;01:55:17;"[laughter]"
01:55:17;01:55:19;"If it's cool,"
01:55:19;01:55:21;"Jake can give your number to me."
01:55:21;01:55:23;"Hey, Justin. Ezra here."
01:55:23;01:55:25;"Jake, give me your contact."
01:55:25;01:55:27;"Ooh!"
01:55:27;01:55:29;"Just a few questions about the"
01:55:29;01:55:31;"tour cancellation. But it's also interesting because"
01:55:31;01:55:33;"first he said that it was about exhaustion,"
01:55:33;01:55:35;"so there's a lot of people being like, ""Hey, exhaustion."""
01:55:35;01:55:37;"Whatever."
01:55:37;01:55:39;"Then the Christ thing is actually more interesting."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"It just raises a lot more theological questions and stuff."
01:55:41;01:55:43;"Anyway,"
01:55:43;01:55:45;"that's our show. Covered a lot of ground."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"This is a real epic one."
01:55:47;01:55:49;"Remember, Gerard was here before."
01:55:49;01:55:51;"And also I want to say,"
01:55:51;01:55:53;"rest in peace to Chester Bennington."
01:55:53;01:55:55;"Obviously very sad to hear"
01:55:55;01:55:57;"that news. You know, best to"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"all his fans, family,"
01:55:59;01:56:01;"friends. I always really did..."
01:56:01;01:56:03;"I don't know. When I saw that, I was like..."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"I definitely felt a little messed up"
01:56:05;01:56:07;"by that. I've just always... I've never been a huge"
01:56:07;01:56:09;"Linkin Park fan, but there was something"
01:56:09;01:56:11;"I always thought was cool about him."
01:56:11;01:56:13;"I don't know. He just always seemed like a real one."
01:56:13;01:56:15;"And to anybody else who's a"
01:56:15;01:56:17;"Chester fan, you should check out"
01:56:17;01:56:19;"later today on Apple Music"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"Corey from Slipknot"
01:56:21;01:56:23;"on a series of bleeps is doing a whole show"
01:56:23;01:56:25;"dedicated to Chester and other"
01:56:25;01:56:27;"musicians who have"
01:56:27;01:56:29;"struggled in similar ways. So you should"
01:56:29;01:56:31;"check that out. We'll see you guys"
01:56:31;01:56:33;"in two weeks. Thanks to everybody"
01:56:33;01:56:35;"who called in. RJ,"
01:56:35;01:56:37;"Steve,"
01:56:37;01:56:39;"and Gerard for being here in person."
01:56:39;01:56:41;"Peace."
