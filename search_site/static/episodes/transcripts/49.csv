03:48;04:13;"- Time Crisis, episode 49."
04:14;04:18;"We have a couple 49ers over here getting up there."
04:18;04:19;"We got a really big show today, man."
04:19;04:20;"We got a lot of ground to cover."
04:20;04:22;"You've been getting crazy listener emails,"
04:22;04:24;"so we definitely gotta dig in the mailbag."
04:24;04:26;"You've been getting a lot of great ones."
04:26;04:29;"We're digging back in this week to a story"
04:29;04:31;"that really touched my heart a few episodes ago"
04:31;04:32;"when you came back from Minnesota"
04:32;04:34;"and you told me about Sweet Martha,"
04:34;04:36;"a person who runs a business"
04:36;04:39;"that's only open 12 days a year"
04:39;04:41;"and yet just rakes in the dough, no pun intended,"
04:41;04:43;"making cookies at the Minnesota State Fair."
04:43;04:45;"So we had a conversation about a while ago."
04:45;04:47;"We've been getting some great emails and tweets"
04:47;04:49;"from people from Minnesota."
04:49;04:51;"It's a really important part of Minnesota culture."
04:51;04:54;"And Time Crisis, we pay tribute to the whole world,"
04:54;04:57;"but specifically these United States."
04:57;04:59;"So anyway, we're picking up where we left off"
04:59;05:03;"and we somehow got Sweet Martha to call into the show."
05:03;05:05;"So you met Sweet Martha, so it's not as exciting for you."
05:05;05:06;"- Yeah, yeah."
05:06;05:07;"- You met her when you went to a wedding in--"
05:07;05:08;"- Yeah, in May."
05:08;05:09;"Went to her lake house."
05:09;05:11;"- Oh, so you've been to Sweet Martha's lake house."
05:11;05:12;"- Yep."
05:12;05:14;"- And the thing about it, learned a lot that night."
05:14;05:15;"- Well, this is gonna be my first time"
05:15;05:16;"talking to Sweet Martha"
05:16;05:19;"and hopefully reintroducing all the TC heads"
05:19;05:21;"to the magic that is Sweet Martha's cookie jar."
05:21;05:22;"So let's get her on the phone."
05:22;05:25;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis hotline."
05:25;05:29;"(phone ringing)"
05:29;05:30;"- Hey, Martha."
05:30;05:30;"- Hello."
05:30;05:32;"- Hey, it's Jake."
05:32;05:33;"- Hi, how are you?"
05:33;05:35;"- Great, how are you?"
05:35;05:37;"- Good, good."
05:37;05:38;"- Also, Ezra's here."
05:38;05:40;"Great to meet you."
05:40;05:42;"So, do people call you Sweet Martha?"
05:42;05:45;"It's my instinct to address you as Sweet Martha."
05:45;05:47;"- Actually, my family doesn't,"
05:47;05:48;"but a lot of other people do."
05:48;05:50;"- So you know, you'd be walking down the street,"
05:50;05:52;"you might get the occasional, ""Sweet Martha."""
05:52;05:54;"- Yes, exactly, if you can believe it."
05:54;05:57;"My husband wanted to name the business after me,"
05:57;05:59;"but then my brother chimed in"
05:59;06:01;"and he thought Sweet Martha would be an appropriate name,"
06:01;06:03;"and I'm like, ""Are you kidding me?"
06:03;06:06;"""I do not want to be sweet all the time like that."""
06:06;06:08;"- Right, you're getting pigeonholed."
06:08;06:10;"- Yeah, exactly."
06:10;06:12;"- My notes say that your husband's name is Gary."
06:12;06:12;"- Yes."
06:12;06:15;"- So Sweet Gary was never in the cards?"
06:15;06:18;"- Well, he felt that it could've been named Gorgeous Gary."
06:18;06:20;"- I don't want to buy cookies from Gorgeous Gary."
06:20;06:22;"(laughing)"
06:22;06:26;"- So just to remind people who haven't heard us"
06:26;06:28;"talk about Sweet Martha's before,"
06:28;06:31;"so Sweet Martha's, it's not exactly a cookie store."
06:31;06:33;"Is it more correct to call it a stand?"
06:33;06:37;"- Yes, we have, actually now we have three stands"
06:37;06:39;"at the Minnesota State Fair."
06:39;06:43;"So in Minnesota, the state fair is huge."
06:43;06:47;"In fact, for the amount of days that it is,"
06:47;06:51;"it's the highest grossing food fair in the country."
06:51;06:53;"- So the thing that I'm so fascinated about, Martha,"
06:53;06:55;"is so Jake told me that Sweet Martha's"
06:55;06:57;"is open for two weeks a year, essentially?"
06:57;06:58;"- About 12 days."
06:58;07:00;"- Okay, not even two weeks, 12 days."
07:00;07:02;"And over the course of those 12 days,"
07:02;07:04;"that's your year of business."
07:04;07:05;"- Right."
07:05;07:06;"- So was it always like that?"
07:06;07:08;"You were covering your entire year with 12 days?"
07:08;07:10;"Or when it started, was this like a hobby?"
07:10;07:11;"- Yeah, there was always that dream"
07:11;07:14;"of getting a booth at the state fair,"
07:14;07:16;"because you just saw all these people"
07:16;07:18;"and all this business,"
07:18;07:20;"and it just seemed like such a great idea."
07:20;07:24;"So probably, I think it was in '78,"
07:24;07:27;"my husband and I opened up a soft serve"
07:27;07:30;"frozen yogurt shop downtown Minneapolis."
07:30;07:33;"And there we started serving"
07:33;07:35;"famous, famous chocolate chip cookies."
07:35;07:37;"They were sort of the craze back then."
07:37;07:40;"That sort of gave us the idea of cookies."
07:40;07:44;"So we applied to the fair for frozen yogurt,"
07:44;07:46;"and we're rejected."
07:46;07:47;"So the following year,"
07:47;07:49;"besides we've kept applying for yogurt too,"
07:49;07:51;"we applied for cookies."
07:51;07:53;"And about a month before the fair started,"
07:53;07:56;"they called with someone that had canceled,"
07:56;07:58;"and they said, ""Do you want to be in the fair?"""
07:58;08:00;"And I said, ""Of course."""
08:00;08:02;"And we hang up, and I go, ""Oh my gosh,"
08:02;08:03;"""what are we gonna do now?"""
08:03;08:05;"Because of course, we knew everything about yogurt,"
08:05;08:08;"but we didn't really know about baking cookies."
08:08;08:09;"- When you first applied,"
08:09;08:13;"it's not like you had some classic recipe on deck."
08:13;08:15;"- Right, not really, no. (laughs)"
08:15;08:17;"- So how'd that first year go?"
08:17;08:20;"- So we had like this month to put together everything."
08:20;08:22;"It was my husband, Gary,"
08:22;08:26;"and then his classmates from high school, Neil."
08:26;08:28;"So I was working on recipes,"
08:28;08:30;"took all our mother's recipes,"
08:30;08:31;"basically compared them,"
08:31;08:35;"and then start getting in all types of chocolate,"
08:35;08:37;"because we all love chocolate,"
08:37;08:39;"and wanted the best kind of chocolate we could find."
08:39;08:42;"- So every year, for 12 days,"
08:42;08:43;"you sell one type of cookie,"
08:43;08:45;"and that's how you make your living."
08:45;08:48;"- Yes, but we do also have our frozen dough"
08:48;08:49;"in the grocery stores year-round."
08:49;08:50;"- That's the American dream,"
08:50;08:52;"is that you could work 12 days,"
08:52;08:54;"or you could sell something for 12 days."
08:54;08:55;"So do you have a lot of free time,"
08:55;08:57;"or the dough operation or getting ready"
08:57;09:00;"takes up so much of your time more than we might think?"
09:00;09:02;"- That's the latter, just what you said."
09:02;09:05;"You know, something that sort of turned into year-round,"
09:05;09:08;"we started in really February scheduling,"
09:08;09:10;"because like for instance, this year,"
09:10;09:12;"we hire for the 12 days."
09:12;09:15;"We're up to about 615 people."
09:15;09:16;"- Wow, it's also really interesting."
09:16;09:18;"Every year you're making one cookie,"
09:18;09:19;"it's the same cookie."
09:19;09:21;"Does the recipe change?"
09:21;09:23;"Are there sweet Martha heads who say like,"
09:23;09:26;"""I still have a bucket of 87 in the freezer."
09:26;09:29;"I'm telling you, nothing's touched it since."""
09:29;09:30;"Are there like people like that?"
09:30;09:34;"- No, a lot of them don't quite make it all the way home."
09:34;09:36;"- Do you feel like they taste the same every year,"
09:36;09:38;"or are there like intangibles?"
09:38;09:40;"Like one year the barometric pressure"
09:40;09:41;"in Minnesota was different."
09:41;09:44;"- There are those factors, seriously,"
09:44;09:47;"and that's where the mixers have to play with the dough"
09:47;09:52;"to try and make sure that it is the consistency we want."
09:52;09:55;"Just because we are actually, you know, mixing outside."
09:55;09:58;"- So you're on site all 12 days?"
09:58;09:59;"- Oh yes."
09:59;10:00;"- Are you eating cookies?"
10:00;10:01;"- Oh yes."
10:01;10:02;"- Yeah, I mean, when I'm around cookies,"
10:02;10:04;"I have a real problem."
10:04;10:05;"So one question I have is like,"
10:05;10:06;"so during those 12 days,"
10:06;10:08;"are you eating other foods besides cookies?"
10:08;10:10;"Or it's just like, that's cookie time."
10:10;10:12;"You gotta be making sure they taste good."
10:12;10:14;"- We eat more than just cookies,"
10:14;10:18;"because of course it is sort of a athletic event."
10:18;10:20;"- What sort of volume are you selling"
10:20;10:22;"in terms of like number of cookies?"
10:22;10:25;"- We do sell more in volume."
10:25;10:27;"You know, we're not like counting the cookies"
10:27;10:29;"as whatever fits in that pail."
10:29;10:31;"But at least a million a day, average."
10:31;10:32;"- A day?"
10:32;10:33;"- Yeah."
10:33;10:35;"- So you're serving out 12 million cookies"
10:35;10:37;"at the Minnesota State Fair?"
10:37;10:40;"- Well, we actually, we have these ovens"
10:40;10:41;"that are rack ovens,"
10:41;10:45;"and they make about 2000 cookies in 12 minutes."
10:45;10:49;"And we have about 17 of these rack ovens now"
10:49;10:50;"with our new stand."
10:50;10:51;"So we make, you know,"
10:51;10:55;"we can make 38,000 cookies in 12 minutes."
10:55;10:56;"- Oh my God. - Wow."
10:56;10:59;"- Yeah, so we are really high production."
10:59;11:00;"- That's unreal."
11:00;11:02;"So Martha, when Jake first told me about this,"
11:02;11:04;"and he's saying this incredible volume,"
11:04;11:07;"12 days, raking in money, all this stuff,"
11:07;11:09;"I'm sure you must get this question a lot,"
11:09;11:11;"but it's the classic American way"
11:11;11:13;"is you start a successful local business,"
11:13;11:15;"generally within four years."
11:15;11:18;"You're expanding, you're selling the license"
11:18;11:21;"to, you know, a French company or something."
11:21;11:23;"Surely you must have had offers."
11:23;11:25;"It sounds like you guys have stayed pretty independent."
11:25;11:26;"- We have."
11:26;11:28;"We sort of like running our own show."
11:28;11:30;"- Have you ever been, got a buyout offer?"
11:30;11:31;"- Oh, sure."
11:31;11:33;"I mean, the people are approaching us, you know,"
11:33;11:34;"in all different ways."
11:34;11:37;"We've done this for 39 years now."
11:37;11:40;"We sort of want to stay the way we are at this point."
11:40;11:41;"The people that are working for us,"
11:41;11:43;"we know so many of them."
11:43;11:46;"They're my family, all my nieces and have everybody,"
11:46;11:48;"and we all get together for 12 days,"
11:48;11:49;"and it's just so much fun."
11:49;11:52;"- I heard actually through the grapevine,"
11:52;11:54;"through Jenny, that you saw the Eagles last week."
11:54;11:57;"- Oh my gosh, they were great."
11:57;11:59;"- So that also begs the question,"
11:59;12:01;"in the early days of Sweet Martha, late 70s,"
12:01;12:04;"when you guys are coming up with the recipes and starting it,"
12:04;12:07;"what type of tunes were blasting out of the kitchen,"
12:07;12:09;"'77, '78, was it the Eagles?"
12:09;12:11;"♪ Take it easy ♪"
12:11;12:13;"- Yeah, it was all those."
12:13;12:16;"- Right, like ""Hall and Oates,"" ""Steely Dan,"""
12:16;12:18;"none of the nascent punk rock scene?"
12:18;12:18;"- No."
12:18;12:20;"- No replacements or prints?"
12:20;12:22;"- Not yet, yeah."
12:22;12:23;"- One last question, Martha."
12:23;12:24;"I'm just curious."
12:24;12:25;"It's so cool hearing you talk about"
12:25;12:28;"running this big operation, but keeping it local,"
12:28;12:29;"and employing friends and family."
12:29;12:32;"Just, I've always been interested by Minnesota culture."
12:32;12:34;"It seems like a really special thing."
12:34;12:37;"There seems like a real type of Minnesota pride,"
12:37;12:38;"and I guess the Minnesota State Fair,"
12:38;12:40;"I didn't even know it was this massive."
12:40;12:44;"Is this the time when Minnesotans can just get together"
12:44;12:47;"and be themselves and celebrate their culture?"
12:47;12:49;"- That's exactly right, you nailed it."
12:49;12:51;"- Is there still a lot of Scandinavian stuff?"
12:51;12:52;"- Oh yeah."
12:52;12:54;"- So when's the first day of the fair?"
12:54;12:55;"- August 24th."
12:55;12:56;"- All right, coming up."
12:56;13:00;"- Yeah, so we're right in the midst of doing all the setup."
13:00;13:02;"- We gotta get out there, this sounds incredible."
13:02;13:02;"- You've got to."
13:02;13:04;"- I always liked Minnesota."
13:04;13:05;"- Well, so do we."
13:05;13:07;"- Vampire show next year, dude."
13:07;13:09;"- Maybe we could get a gig at the Minnesota State Fair,"
13:09;13:11;"'cause there's like a lot of music, right?"
13:11;13:11;"- Oh yeah."
13:11;13:12;"- I bet you could, man."
13:12;13:14;"- Who's playing this year?"
13:14;13:15;"- Usher, I think, and--"
13:15;13:16;"- Usher?"
13:16;13:17;"- Yeah."
13:17;13:20;"- Wow, well cool, I hope Usher, if you're listening."
13:20;13:21;"Check out Sweet Martha's, man."
13:21;13:22;"- Yeah."
13:22;13:24;"- Great, well thanks so much, Martha,"
13:24;13:26;"and we hope you have a great fair this year."
13:26;13:27;"- Thank you so much."

15:32;15:39;"- You're listening to Time Crisis on Beast One."
15:39;15:41;"- Wow, sweet Martha."
15:41;15:43;"How about those numbers, Jake?"
15:43;15:44;"- Insane."
15:44;15:45;"How many cookies was that?"
15:45;15:47;"- Well, she said a million a day,"
15:47;15:49;"so we can guess about 12 million."
15:49;15:51;"Wait, and they've been doing it, well--"
15:51;15:54;"- They're doing 38,000 cookies every 12 minutes."
15:54;15:55;"Love that."
15:55;15:56;"- It also begs the question,"
15:56;15:57;"so she's saying that Famous Amos"
15:57;15:59;"was kind of their inspiration?"
15:59;16:00;"- Right."
16:00;16:02;"- So if sweet Martha is selling 12 million cookies"
16:02;16:04;"in 12 days, how many cookies"
16:04;16:06;"is Famous Amos selling a year?"
16:06;16:07;"A billion?"
16:07;16:08;"What about Grandma?"
16:08;16:09;"Not your grandma, but Grandma,"
16:09;16:10;"who makes Grandma's cookies."
16:10;16:11;"- Grandma's cookies you can buy"
16:11;16:14;"in like middle school cafeteria."
16:14;16:16;"- Yeah, a DMV vending machine."
16:16;16:18;"- Yeah, so it's like a different,"
16:18;16:20;"and it's admirable of sweet Martha's"
16:20;16:21;"to resist that."
16:21;16:24;"We're like deep, like Wall Street money's coming in,"
16:24;16:25;"being like, yo, I'll cut you a check"
16:25;16:28;"for 48 million right now."
16:28;16:30;"- Monsanto sneaking around, trying to get that recipe."
16:30;16:33;"- Like, just take this off your hands."
16:33;16:33;"- Yeah."
16:33;16:34;"- And just being like, you know what,"
16:34;16:35;"this is family business, we're keeping it local,"
16:35;16:37;"keeping it small."
16:37;16:40;"Savvy, too, to sell those cookies 12 days a year."
16:40;16:42;"That way people are like looking forward to it."
16:42;16:45;"If you went into like a CVS,"
16:45;16:47;"and there's sweet Martha's just there,"
16:47;16:51;"365 days a year available, you know,"
16:51;16:54;"when you go to the fair, the cookies won't have as much sway."
16:54;16:57;"- Look to the cookie, Elaine."
16:57;16:58;"Look to the cookie."
16:58;17:00;"- So Jake, we've been getting so many great emails,"
17:00;17:02;"as always, we read them all."
17:02;17:03;"- Oh yeah."
17:03;17:04;"- But sometimes the volume we can't keep up with,"
17:04;17:07;"but Jake, you picked a few good ones for this week,"
17:07;17:10;"and you got an interesting one about fish"
17:10;17:11;"that I think you should read."
17:11;17:11;"- Okay."
17:11;17:14;"Dear Jake, as with other Time Crisis fans"
17:14;17:16;"who have written you, I'd like to apologize"
17:16;17:18;"for intruding and using your personal email."
17:18;17:20;"- I love the politeness."
17:20;17:23;"- I'd also like to thank you for your disregard"
17:23;17:25;"for personal privacy and allowing this to become"
17:25;17:28;"an unofficial Time Crisis hotline."
17:28;17:29;"It's a personal/business email."
17:29;17:34;"- Don't even sweat it, it's personal/business."
17:34;17:35;"- I'm writing in the hope that you'll be able"
17:35;17:38;"to shed some light on a phenomenon I came across"
17:38;17:39;"living in Chicago last year."
17:39;17:42;"My usual country of residence is the UK,"
17:42;17:44;"to which I have now returned."
17:44;17:47;"The phenomenon in question is the band Fish"
17:47;17:49;"and the level of fanaticism it inspires."
17:49;17:52;"During my time in Chicago, I was amazed to meet"
17:52;17:54;"numerous people who followed the band around the country"
17:54;17:57;"on a seemingly endless touring schedule."
17:57;18:00;"One particularly impressive fish head took three flights"
18:00;18:03;"in a weekend to catch consecutive shows."
18:03;18:06;"I'd like to know how you and Ezra view Fish"
18:06;18:09;"and whether these fish heads are bona fide successors"
18:09;18:10;"to the original Deadheads."
18:10;18:11;"Best, Josh."
18:11;18:12;"- Great email."
18:12;18:14;"- Contentious territory."
18:14;18:16;"- Honestly, on this show, we've talked about"
18:16;18:18;"a lot of controversial things."
18:18;18:21;"Socialism, One Direction, but we've never ventured"
18:21;18:23;"into these waters, but maybe it's time."
18:23;18:25;"Infamously, for people who don't know,"
18:25;18:27;"the Grateful Dead, biggest touring band in America"
18:27;18:29;"in the late '80s, early '90s,"
18:29;18:31;"huge jam band, kind of post-hippie scene."
18:31;18:33;"- Yeah, started that archetype."
18:33;18:34;"- Started that archetype."
18:34;18:38;"1995, the tragic early death of Jerry Garcia."
18:38;18:40;"Dead stops touring."
18:40;18:42;"And the way a lot of people tell the story,"
18:42;18:45;"then these kind of Grateful Dead acolytes"
18:45;18:47;"from Vermont, Fish, fill the void."
18:47;18:49;"And Going to See Fish becomes the new"
18:49;18:50;"Going to See the Grateful Dead."
18:50;18:52;"And the next 20 years, Fish becomes"
18:52;18:54;"one of the biggest touring bands in America."
18:54;18:57;"So there's definitely some people who love"
18:57;18:59;"the Grateful Dead and they smoothly transition"
18:59;19:02;"into loving Fish, but then there's other people"
19:02;19:04;"who draw a line and say, ""No, no, I don't like Fish."
19:04;19:05;"""I like the Dead."""
19:05;19:08;"And Jake, I believe you're more in that category."
19:08;19:09;"- That is fair."
19:09;19:10;"- Not a Fish fan."
19:10;19:12;"- Well, first of all, the songs are not there."
19:12;19:15;"I think Jerry was a great songwriter."
19:15;19:16;"And I just don't hear that with Fish."
19:16;19:18;"I mean, they have a couple songs where I'm like,"
19:18;19:22;"""Okay, this is cool,"" but it's hard to really go in hard"
19:22;19:26;"on second generation of that thing."
19:26;19:29;"- Now, people would say Fish is like their own language"
19:29;19:30;"and I'm sure that's true."
19:30;19:34;"I also found Fish to be very technical and cold"
19:34;19:37;"and virtuosic in a way that was reminiscent"
19:37;19:41;"of dudes that are going to the Berkeley School of Music"
19:41;19:44;"in Boston and are deepest guitar shredders."
19:44;19:46;"To me, Fish seems academic."
19:46;19:48;"That's what it comes down to."
19:48;19:49;"- I knew some Fish heads growing up"
19:49;19:51;"and I never really listened to Fish,"
19:51;19:54;"but I remember they would tell me there was a Fish song"
19:54;19:57;"called ""Golgi Apparatus"" and I thought that was funny."
19:57;19:59;"Here's ""Golgi Apparatus"" live in '93."
20:02;20:16;"I like this part, it's kind of like Scott."
20:16;20:19;"- Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up."
20:19;20:22;"I gotta say, man, of those East Coast jam bands"
20:22;20:25;"in the '90s, I much preferred Blues Traveler."
20:25;20:26;"- Oh yeah, I like Blues Traveler."
20:26;20:30;"- Who wrote good songs, had a pretty unique,"
20:30;20:31;"idiosyncratic singer."
20:31;20:40;"I remember kids wearing Fish shirts in the early '90s"
20:40;20:42;"and I was like, those shirts are dope."
20:42;20:45;"And I wanted, yeah, just a green shirt"
20:45;20:48;"with that awesome green Fish logo on it."
20:48;20:50;"Like green on green."
20:50;20:50;"- Yeah, they had good t-shirts."
20:50;20:53;"- It was like a tight Vermont tie-in."
20:53;20:55;"And I remember really wanting to like Fish."
20:55;20:58;"- I love that they're from Vermont, I love Vermont."
20:58;21:01;"But, so that's Fish live at their peak."
21:01;21:04;"This is the Dead live at their peak."
21:04;21:05;"- 20 years prior."
21:05;21:08;"- It's a little unfair just because live recordings"
21:08;21:12;"simply sounded better in 1972 versus '93."
21:12;21:14;"- Well, why would live recordings sound better?"
21:14;21:16;"- 'Cause they were recording a tape."
21:16;21:18;"No, but they were recording a tape and stuff."
21:18;21:21;"I mean, I'm just saying, it had the tasteful '70s palette."
21:21;21:23;"- But I feel like the live recording comparison"
21:23;21:27;"would be in a way more objective or something."
21:27;21:31;"'Cause like '90s drum sounds in a recording studio"
21:31;21:32;"are gonna be brutal."
21:32;21:33;"- Ah, right."
21:33;21:34;"Well, yeah."
21:34;21:38;"Okay, Grateful Dead is definitely more tasteful."
21:38;21:42;"- Fish didn't have the melodic content that the Dead had."
21:42;21:43;"You know?"
21:43;21:47;"- My take is kinda like, sunflower."
21:47;21:50;"- I like Sunfish, Grateful Dead's a bigger fan,"
21:50;21:51;"speaks to me more."
21:51;21:53;"It's interesting because I always like music"
21:53;21:56;"that has the right balance of seriousness"
21:56;21:58;"and lightheartedness, which the Grateful Dead"
21:58;22:00;"really hit that perfectly."
22:00;22:02;"They got their kinda deep, hippie songs,"
22:02;22:03;"but then they have the fun ones."
22:03;22:11;"You know, these are very subtle differentiations."
22:11;22:14;"Arguably, this is the narcissism of small difference."
22:14;22:16;"- I don't think we're in the narcissism of small difference."
22:16;22:18;"- I think this is the narcissism"
22:18;22:21;"of pretty major differences."
22:21;22:23;"- Still narcissism, but it's a major difference."
22:23;22:26;"It's like Fish, it's either you're in on the joke"
22:26;22:27;"or you're not, and if you're not,"
22:27;22:29;"it could come across as maybe like--"
22:29;22:30;"- It's not goofy, though."
22:30;22:31;"It's generic."
22:31;22:32;"That's the problem with it."
22:32;22:34;"- No, but they do goofy stuff."
22:34;22:36;"They used to jump on trampolines in the show."
22:36;22:38;"- Yeah, no, I'm talking about the musical content,"
22:38;22:43;"like the harmonic content of their songs are like,"
22:43;22:46;"it's just generic to me."
22:46;22:50;"- Well, there's a lot of bands, like Widespread, Leftover."
22:50;22:54;"Those bands are all in the same genre as Fish,"
22:54;22:58;"which is like late '80s, early '90s, East Coast jam bands."
22:58;23:00;"The Dead were like fully on their own trip."
23:00;23:03;"- Let's listen to Fish live at Madison Square Garden '97,"
23:03;23:05;"Punch You in the Eye Live."
23:05;23:06;"Maybe this has a kinder vibe."
23:57;24:11;"- Maybe CT could give us some recs."
24:11;24:12;"- Oh yeah, we gotta call CT."
24:12;24:15;"- It's just like bad funk."
24:15;24:16;"- Live recordings are done."
24:16;24:19;"- I'm talking about the actual compositional content."
24:19;24:20;"- Wow."
24:20;24:23;"- I'm not talking about the live recording versus studio."
24:23;24:28;"- Even if Fish recorded on the tasteful 1972 tape machine."
24:28;24:29;"- Brutal."
24:29;24:31;"- Okay, well let's call Chris Thompson"
24:31;24:33;"'cause he's the biggest fishhead that I know."
24:33;24:34;"Let's get CT on the phone."
24:34;24:38;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
24:38;24:41;"(phone ringing)"
24:41;24:42;"- Hello?"
24:42;24:43;"- Hello."
24:43;24:44;"- Hey, what's up CT?"
24:44;24:44;"- How's it going?"
24:44;24:46;"- Welcome to Time Crisis, you're on with me and Jake,"
24:46;24:47;"you know us."
24:47;24:49;"- It's truly a pleasure to be here."
24:49;24:52;"- So we got a fan email this week."
24:52;24:56;"It was from an English guy who was in Chicago for a year"
24:56;24:57;"and he made some American friends"
24:57;24:58;"who introduced him to Fish"
24:58;25:00;"and he was kind of bewildered by it."
25:00;25:01;"And he asked us what we thought"
25:01;25:03;"and Fish is obviously in the atmosphere today"
25:03;25:05;"so we're just kind of talking Fish over here."
25:05;25:08;"Jake, you know, is a huge Grateful Dead fan"
25:08;25:10;"and he's not the biggest Fish fan."
25:10;25:13;"So I wanted to bring somebody on who I know is a Fish fan."
25:13;25:15;"Or actually, before I go any further,"
25:15;25:17;"just explain your relationship to Fish."
25:17;25:18;"- Well for me personally, they're very,"
25:18;25:20;"I would say elemental and fundamental."
25:20;25:24;"I found them probably as a lot of people do in high school."
25:24;25:27;"And I don't know, there was something about"
25:27;25:29;"both the vibe, the music itself,"
25:29;25:34;"like the visuals, sort of the mythos of the world"
25:34;25:36;"that really drew me in and drew me in deep."
25:36;25:38;"And I probably had like six to seven"
25:38;25:41;"like solid deep, deep years where that was like"
25:41;25:44;"a main concern of mine was Fish"
25:44;25:47;"and like hearing old shows, like digging into the albums,"
25:47;25:48;"like trying to see shows"
25:48;25:51;"when they weren't on hiatus at that point."
25:51;25:52;"So I think that that was definitely"
25:52;25:55;"one of my first true loves in music."
25:55;25:57;"- So how many times did you see them?"
25:57;25:58;"- You know, I've lost the exact count."
25:58;26:03;"I'd put it around 26 with my latest being last Friday"
26:03;26:07;"as the 11th show of the Baker's Dozen."
26:07;26:09;"- Oh, so you went to the Baker's Dozen?"
26:09;26:10;"- I went to one of them, yeah."
26:10;26:12;"I didn't go to all 13, but I went to one."
26:12;26:15;"- So, okay, so around 26."
26:16;26:19;"- It's somewhere between like 25 and 30."
26:19;26:20;"- This show that you saw in New York"
26:20;26:21;"in Madison Square Garden,"
26:21;26:23;"that was the first Fish show you'd seen in a while?"
26:23;26:26;"- Probably in like four or five years, yeah."
26:26;26:28;"I think the one previous to that was when"
26:28;26:30;"Vampiricum played Austin City Limits."
26:30;26:31;"And I don't know if you remember,"
26:31;26:33;"we had it hooked up where we played"
26:33;26:35;"right before Fish did across the field."
26:35;26:36;"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
26:36;26:37;"- And we had it set up where I could hustle"
26:37;26:40;"into the golf cart with one of my Fish cohorts,"
26:40;26:41;"the legendary Buddy Herms."
26:41;26:44;"And they kind of like whipped us right over there."
26:44;26:45;"Didn't miss a note."
26:45;26:48;"- I love, CT, final Vampire Weekend song,"
26:48;26:49;"probably Walcott."
26:49;26:51;"15 seconds later, CT's in the golf cart"
26:51;26:53;"on the way to see Fish."
26:53;26:55;"- I mean, that's a rare,"
26:55;26:58;"because Fish rarely plays with other people."
26:58;26:59;"- Yeah, yeah, actually, I was gonna say,"
26:59;27:02;"you don't hear about Fish at festivals that often."
27:02;27:05;"- I think they've done a few latter-day Bonnaroos."
27:05;27:08;"They were part of the original Horror Zone."
27:08;27:10;"I think one of their big opening slots ever was,"
27:10;27:13;"I believe in '92, was for Carlos Santana for a minute."
27:13;27:14;"- Oh, wow."
27:14;27:16;"- So, a weird middle zone for him."
27:16;27:19;"But yeah, yeah, so the fact that they were playing"
27:19;27:21;"this festival that we were playing literally"
27:21;27:24;"right before them was very meaningful to me."
27:24;27:26;"So, I had to get over there and check it out."
27:26;27:28;"- Okay, so now they're playing in New York,"
27:28;27:29;"Madison's Graveyard."
27:29;27:31;"You're going on the 11th night."
27:31;27:33;"So, paint a picture for us."
27:33;27:35;"13 nights of Fish is happening."
27:35;27:37;"Is there a crazy energy in the air?"
27:37;27:39;"What's the vibe over there?"
27:39;27:40;"Who's there?"
27:40;27:41;"What's the crowd like?"
27:41;27:42;"- My personal relationship to the Bakers doesn't."
27:42;27:43;"I knew about it for a while,"
27:43;27:47;"but sort of like in my now more cynical self,"
27:47;27:49;"sort of like, ""Ah, I've seen enough shows."
27:49;27:51;"""I'm probably okay."""
27:51;27:53;"And then, you know, the does starts rolling."
27:53;27:56;"And you're hearing reports from friends that are seeing it,"
27:56;27:58;"checking out the set list,"
27:58;28:00;"and kind of getting more and more excited"
28:00;28:01;"as the does goes along."
28:01;28:03;"And then finally, by the end of week one,"
28:03;28:04;"I had to pull the trigger."
28:04;28:05;"I was like, ""You know what?"
28:05;28:06;"""I gotta check this out."""
28:06;28:08;"- Did you buy a ticket, or did you get some weird hookup?"
28:08;28:09;"- Both."
28:09;28:10;"(laughing)"
28:10;28:11;"- Okay, got you."
28:11;28:12;"We'll buy."
28:12;28:14;"- Were they all sold out at that point, or not?"
28:14;28:16;"- Yes, as far as I knew they were, yeah."
28:16;28:19;"I went straight to the top of the pyramid"
28:19;28:21;"to buy three tickets."
28:21;28:22;"- Oh yeah, I'm sure."
28:22;28:26;"So when you're there, was it an older crowd?"
28:26;28:28;"Did you feel like a young guy at the Fizz Show, or what?"
28:28;28:29;"- You know what?"
28:29;28:30;"I'm not a young guy anymore."
28:30;28:34;"I felt like I was probably right around the average."
28:34;28:35;"- Did you see like college kids?"
28:35;28:37;"- Yeah, I think especially 'cause these tickets"
28:37;28:38;"were a little bit more expensive"
28:38;28:41;"than their normal tour runs and stuff."
28:41;28:43;"So it's like a lot of people who,"
28:43;28:47;"this is a Friday night, so if you work like a dog all week,"
28:47;28:48;"you get your Fizz Show on Friday."
28:48;28:50;"(laughing)"
28:50;28:53;"- That old chestnut."
28:53;28:55;"- I mean, I'm sure you've heard that before."
28:55;28:56;"- Yeah."
28:56;28:58;"- I think that's what the song ""Hard Day's Night"" is about."
28:58;29:02;"- So we're reading, now that the Baker's Dozen is over,"
29:02;29:03;"we got all the stats."
29:03;29:07;"So Fizz sold 227,000 tickets, three of those were you,"
29:07;29:09;"and over the course of 13 nights,"
29:09;29:14;"they played for 34 hours, 33 minutes and 38 seconds."
29:14;29:18;"And of those 13 shows and those 34 and a half hours--"
29:18;29:19;"- No repeats."
29:19;29:20;"- No repeats of the song."
29:20;29:21;"So-- - Sick."
29:21;29:22;"- Did you know that going in?"
29:22;29:24;"Was that like the buzz ahead of time"
29:24;29:25;"that there was gonna be no repeats"
29:25;29:27;"or that's something people started to realize"
29:27;29:28;"over the course of the run?"
29:28;29:30;"- Again, my face in the fandom"
29:30;29:31;"is a little bit tangential at this point,"
29:31;29:33;"so I wasn't really hearing the chatter,"
29:33;29:35;"but it sort of like became apparent"
29:35;29:37;"after four or five nights and like,"
29:37;29:38;"not only were they not repeating,"
29:38;29:40;"but they had kept a lot of their true bangers"
29:40;29:41;"like had not appeared."
29:41;29:44;"- Did you get any classic Fizz songs in your set"
29:44;29:47;"or did you show up and they're doing like a 45 minute"
29:47;29:50;"while my guitar gently weeps or something?"
29:50;29:51;"- I mean, I think that's, you know,"
29:51;29:54;"again, there's classics for everybody."
29:54;29:56;"The one song actually that my friend Brian,"
29:56;29:58;"who I went to my first Fizz show with,"
29:58;30:00;"the one that we got at our first Fizz show,"
30:00;30:02;"which is I think still fairly rare,"
30:02;30:03;"it's called ""Fluffhead."""
30:03;30:04;"- Great title."
30:04;30:05;"- It's about this guy named Fluffhead,"
30:05;30:08;"he goes to a banker, he's trying to get some pills."
30:08;30:09;"Yeah, it's a whole thing."
30:09;30:11;"I think it pushes, you know,"
30:11;30:12;"depending on how long they jam for,"
30:12;30:14;"like 10 to 15 minutes."
30:14;30:15;"Both Brian and I were very excited to get that"
30:15;30:17;"and they closed the second set with ""Fluffhead,"""
30:17;30:19;"so you can imagine the place going crazy."
30:19;30:20;"- Right, so opening notes of ""Fluffhead,"""
30:20;30:23;"you and Brian, your boy, look at each other"
30:23;30:25;"and you're just like, ""Holy (beep) man,"
30:25;30:26;"""they're playing 'Fluff.'"""
30:26;30:28;"- Essentially, yeah, Brian looks over and goes,"
30:28;30:29;"""Dude, it's 'Fluffhead.'"""
30:29;30:32;"- What percentage of that set did you know?"
30:32;30:33;"- 80%, 80%."
30:33;30:34;"- Okay, you're ahead."
30:34;30:35;"- Oh, truly."
30:35;30:36;"- Impressive."
30:36;30:37;"Any sick covers?"
30:37;30:38;"- Oh, dude, so my theme,"
30:38;30:41;"I don't know what you discussed about the Baker's Dozen, but--"
30:41;30:41;"- Oh no, actually explain it."
30:41;30:44;"We didn't explain the weird theme stuff"
30:44;30:44;"of the Baker's Dozen."
30:44;30:46;"- So I read an interview with Trey,"
30:46;30:48;"his own personal recap of the Dozen"
30:48;30:51;"was apparently this is just an age-old band joke"
30:51;30:53;"of if they played a Boston song"
30:53;30:55;"mashed up with a Cream song,"
30:55;30:56;"it's, you know, get Boston Cream."
30:56;30:57;"- Sick."
30:57;30:59;"- They extrapolated that out to a 13-night run"
30:59;31:02;"where every night had a theme donut flavor,"
31:02;31:04;"which I believe that they handed out"
31:04;31:07;"like 1,000 donuts per night of each flavor."
31:07;31:10;"I did not get a donut, but my theme was Lemon Poppy Seed."
31:10;31:12;"So the two Lemon songs were"
31:12;31:14;"See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"
31:14;31:15;"done by Blind Lemon Jefferson."
31:15;31:16;"- Old blues song, yeah."
31:16;31:20;"- And then I think more Time Crisis-friendly cover,"
31:20;31:22;"They Played Everything In Its Right Place."
31:22;31:23;"- Okay. - Oh, by Radiohead."
31:23;31:23;"- Yeah."
31:23;31:27;"- Because it goes, ♪ Yesterday I was sucking a lemon ♪"
31:27;31:28;"- I think that's exactly the reason why they played it."
31:28;31:30;"- So when they kicked into the Radiohead song,"
31:30;31:32;"are you putting it together?"
31:32;31:34;"Are you immediately thinking, ah, Lemon Night?"
31:34;31:36;"- Well, I will admit my engagement"
31:36;31:38;"with the nights that I didn't go to was somewhat less,"
31:38;31:41;"but I definitely did some poking around before."
31:41;31:42;"- Right."
31:42;31:42;"- Like once they announced the theme"
31:42;31:44;"like that morning or something,"
31:44;31:46;"that I sort of like, I was checking the chatter"
31:46;31:48;"and seeing what people were throwing out there."
31:48;31:50;"I think the one that people most expected"
31:50;31:52;"was the Lemon song from Zeppelin,"
31:52;31:54;"but I think that was too on the nose."
31:54;31:57;"But I see everything in its right place, like listed."
31:57;32:00;"So when the electric piano sort of kicks in,"
32:00;32:03;"you're kind of like, nice. (laughs)"
32:03;32:08;"♪ Lovehead was a man ♪"
32:08;32:13;"♪ With a horrible disease ♪"
32:13;32:18;"♪ Could not find no cure ♪"

34:15;34:18;"- And so, so this is like a pretty long show."
34:18;34:21;"- Yeah, you know, around two, two 20, I wasn't timing it."
34:21;34:24;"But you know, generally, we're talking like a basketball"
34:24;34:26;"game with overtime, so like two, two and a half."
34:26;34:28;"- Okay, so one thing that we've been talking about, CT,"
34:28;34:30;"is Fish versus the Dead."
34:30;34:33;"So when you got into Fish in high school,"
34:33;34:35;"were you already a Grateful Dead fan"
34:35;34:36;"or Grateful Dead meant nothing to you?"
34:36;34:39;"- I was aware of the Grateful Dead, you know,"
34:39;34:42;"like heard the classic rock radio songs."
34:42;34:43;"Don't think I'd listened to an album,"
34:43;34:46;"was generally aware of their cultural position,"
34:46;34:49;"or, you know, like equated like Grateful Dead, hippies,"
34:49;34:52;"you know, a very reductive sense of it."
34:52;34:54;"So I would say that I definitely got into Fish before"
34:54;34:57;"and then also way deeper than I ever did the Dead."
34:57;34:59;"I mean, I'm a Dead fan, but I'm a Fish head, I would say."
34:59;35:01;"- Do you think Fish is better than the Dead?"
35:01;35:03;"Is it more fun to be a Fish fan?"
35:03;35:07;"It seems like a really like fun culture to be a part of,"
35:07;35:09;"like, was that an element of it too?"
35:09;35:11;"Like outside of going to the shows and enjoying the music,"
35:11;35:13;"is it just like kind of fun to like go deep"
35:13;35:14;"with other Fish heads?"
35:14;35:18;"- Yeah, I mean, there's a certain tribal thing"
35:18;35:21;"that even as like early internet days,"
35:21;35:25;"Central New Jersey, 15 year old like myself,"
35:25;35:28;"if you get interested and like the spark hits,"
35:28;35:31;"there's just like mountains and upon mountains of like data"
35:31;35:35;"and like I had, I don't think I've thrown it away."
35:35;35:36;"I bought like a physical encyclopedia"
35:36;35:40;"that had every set list of every show up to like 2000."
35:40;35:42;"It was just a culture that connected"
35:42;35:47;"with my own innate sense of like archival detail."
35:47;35:48;"- One thing that Jake said earlier is that"
35:48;35:50;"he doesn't respect Fish's songwriting."
35:50;35:53;"It's not even about the jams or the musicianship."
35:53;35:55;"He just loves Jerry as a songwriter"
35:55;35:56;"and there aren't any like Fish songs"
35:56;35:58;"that really speak to him,"
35:58;35:59;"but maybe you could set him straight."
35:59;36:02;"Are there any like Fish songs that are not like the fun,"
36:02;36:05;"funky ones, but that you think are just like beautiful,"
36:05;36:06;"beautiful, good songwriting?"
36:06;36:09;"- The one that comes to mind is Brian and Robert"
36:09;36:11;"from ""Story of a Ghost."""
36:11;36:13;"The things that I were drawn to,"
36:13;36:16;"especially like in the initial burst were like songwriting"
36:16;36:18;"and more like a sense of composition,"
36:18;36:20;"like a song like, yeah, whatever,"
36:20;36:22;"""You Enjoy Myself"" or ""Divided Sky."""
36:22;36:24;"I thought it was like very well-written, like musically."
36:24;36:26;"I understand sort of the lyrical point."
36:26;36:29;"Try Brian and Robert and see how that hits you."
36:29;36:30;"- I have a question."
36:30;36:33;"Is there a sense of like humor"
36:33;36:36;"with the less tasteful aspects of Fish?"
36:36;36:39;"Because in the dead culture, at least personally,"
36:39;36:42;"there is a sense of like, yeah,"
36:42;36:45;"everyone knows Bob Weir singing ""El Paso"""
36:45;36:47;"is like kind of funny."
36:47;36:48;"And it's like kind of dorky."
36:48;36:50;"- Does Bob Weir know that?"
36:50;36:51;"- I don't think he does."
36:51;36:54;"And I'm sure there's deadheads that are like ride or die"
36:54;36:56;"for Bob Weir doing ""El Paso."""
36:56;36:58;"But to me, it's like part of like the charm of the dead"
36:58;37:00;"is that they could be so sublime"
37:00;37:02;"and transcendent and beautiful,"
37:02;37:07;"and then be so idiotic and like just do the dumbest,"
37:07;37:12;"terrible sounding versions of old country songs."
37:12;37:13;"So I'm wondering if in Fish,"
37:13;37:15;"there's that sort of like humor about-"
37:15;37:17;"- The less than tasteful side of the threat."
37:17;37:20;"- Yeah, like their own sort of, I don't know, idiocy."
37:20;37:22;"- Well, I think that if always,"
37:22;37:25;"and also I would suggest like a true starting point,"
37:25;37:26;"even if you're somewhat Fish-phobic,"
37:26;37:30;"is watching ""Bittersweet Motel."""
37:30;37:31;"- Oh, that's a Fish doc?"
37:31;37:32;"- It's worth your time."
37:32;37:34;"It's directed by a young Todd Phillips,"
37:34;37:35;"who as we all know,"
37:35;37:37;"went on to create the ""Hangover"" trilogy."
37:37;37:37;"- Wow."
37:37;37:40;"And he did a doc on Gigi Allen as well."
37:40;37:41;"- I think Fish saw that"
37:41;37:43;"and asked him to make a movie about that."
37:43;37:44;"- Wow."
37:44;37:47;"- I think it's like '97, like fall '97,"
37:47;37:49;"which is one of my personal favorite years."
37:49;37:52;"I remember seeing that in the theaters in Rochester,"
37:52;37:53;"like the day before Thanksgiving,"
37:53;37:55;"whatever year it came out."
37:55;37:57;"And like just being like so blown away"
37:57;37:59;"at like this sort of like inside peak"
37:59;38:00;"about like touring in general,"
38:00;38:02;"about this band that I really liked"
38:02;38:05;"and sort of only like heard,"
38:05;38:07;"I hadn't seen live yet at that point."
38:07;38:08;"That comes to mind because"
38:08;38:10;"that really does show their personalities."
38:10;38:12;"And I think that they definitely,"
38:12;38:14;"I agree with you that there's some of the same range there"
38:14;38:16;"where they can like,"
38:16;38:19;"some moments that they hit are like incredible,"
38:19;38:21;"that I feel like I've seen a few live."
38:21;38:22;"I've like definitely like felt it"
38:22;38:23;"when I've listened to some stuff."
38:23;38:24;"- Yeah."
38:24;38:26;"- But it can also be like total goofballs."
38:26;38:28;"- Yeah, they have a sense of humor about themselves."
38:28;38:29;"- Absolutely."
38:29;38:31;"- You're not gonna find Radiohead doing donut night"
38:31;38:32;"at Madison Square Garden."
38:32;38:34;"(laughing)"
38:34;38:35;"- You never know."
38:35;38:36;"- Yeah, maybe."
38:36;38:37;"Maybe they'll loosen up a little."
38:37;38:38;"- I mean, I think that's the future of touring."
38:38;38:40;"Like you have an audience in like a region"
38:40;38:42;"that you can draw from,"
38:42;38:43;"they could be with their families,"
38:43;38:44;"they could sleep at home every night."
38:44;38:46;"- Right, we gotta come up with a theme night."
38:46;38:48;"- Okay, Halloween, New York,"
38:48;38:50;"vampire weekends, vampires weekend."
38:50;38:52;"Friday and Saturday night,"
38:52;38:53;"different show, both nights."
38:53;38:54;"- Or should it be three nights?"
38:54;38:55;"- I guess I would start off with two,"
38:55;38:56;"I was just being kind of cautious."
38:56;38:58;"But yeah, sure, three, why not?"
38:58;39:01;"- I'd love to see you guys do three shows, no repeats."
39:01;39:03;"- Oh, that's tough, the no repeats thing."
39:03;39:04;"But we can get that."
39:04;39:05;"- Only played A-Punk once, dude."
39:05;39:06;"(laughing)"
39:06;39:07;"- I think we can do that with three shows."
39:07;39:09;"- Close the third night with A-Punk."
39:09;39:11;"- I think we just need to come up with a list"
39:11;39:13;"that's the songs that have to be repeated."
39:13;39:15;"It's sort of understood, like sort of baseline."
39:15;39:16;"And then there's--"
39:16;39:17;"- I don't know if the fans are gonna respect that, man."
39:17;39:19;"I think we have to be no,"
39:19;39:21;"okay, okay, so let's do two nights, no repeats."
39:21;39:23;"Eight minute Cape Cod for sure."
39:23;39:25;"So fish to the baker's dozen."
39:25;39:28;"- What's like a fun thing that comes in two?"
39:28;39:29;"Twix."
39:29;39:30;"(laughing)"
39:30;39:34;"That's perfect, Vampire Weekend, Halloween Twix."
39:34;39:34;"- Presented by Twix."
39:34;39:36;"- Presented by Twix."
39:36;39:40;"Each night we give you one of the Twix."
39:40;39:43;"You gotta write your name on the wrapper"
39:43;39:46;"and we administer one Twix each night."
39:46;39:47;"- No repeats."
39:47;39:49;"- No repeats."
39:49;39:52;"We wanna thank our corporate partner, Twix,"
39:52;39:54;"for sponsoring our two night no repeats."
39:55;39:57;"- Played giving up the gun both nights."
39:57;39:58;"(laughing)"
39:58;39:59;"- That would also be hilarious"
39:59;40:01;"if we planned out this whole thing"
40:01;40:02;"and then just randomly we played"
40:02;40:04;"giving up the gun both nights."
40:04;40:07;"And we're just like, after we play it on the second night,"
40:07;40:09;"everybody's looking at us and we're just like,"
40:09;40:13;"oh dude, we're so sorry."
40:13;40:15;"We're so sorry about that."
40:15;40:19;"All right, CT, well thanks so much for calling in, man."
40:19;40:21;"- Of course, Jake can ask you how do you,"
40:21;40:22;"you know, I'm sure you've probably"
40:22;40:25;"had this conversation before with people"
40:25;40:26;"not over FaceTime audio."
40:26;40:28;"How do you feel about after this talk though?"
40:28;40:30;"I really think Bittersweet Motel is worth your time."
40:30;40:32;"- The doc, I'd love to check it out"
40:32;40:34;"and I'm psyched to hear Brian and Robert."
40:34;40:35;"I'm psyched to hear it."
40:35;40:37;"Like I said, I have trouble connecting"
40:37;40:41;"with Trey's songwriting, but I'm dying to hear this song."
40:41;40:43;"- All right, well I wish you Godspeed."
40:43;40:44;"- I will talk to you later, CT."
40:44;40:46;"- All right, see ya. - Thank you, bye."
40:46;40:47;"- Beats one."
40:47;40:51;"Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
40:51;40:54;"Well, Jake, CT made a strong case for Fish, man."
40:54;40:56;"Maybe you're gonna see that doc come back"
40:56;40:59;"tell the rest of the dudes in the Grateful Dead cover band,"
40:59;41:02;"guys, maybe we start working some fish into the set."
41:02;41:06;"- I love that Todd Phillips went from G.G. Allen to fish."
41:06;41:08;"- And then the hangover."
41:08;41:08;"Quite a career."
41:08;41:10;"Here, let's check out the song CT was talking about."
41:10;41:11;"This is Brian and Robert."

46:58;47:02;"We're getting some real gold out of the mailbag this week."
47:02;47:03;"- Yeah."
47:03;47:05;"- You got another email that is kind of tied to the fish one"
47:05;47:07;"'cause it's also Vermont themed."
47:07;47:08;"Let's get into it."
47:08;47:09;"- I'll read this one."
47:09;47:10;"- Okay."
47:10;47:11;"- Hi Jake, my name is Sophia"
47:11;47:13;"and I'm a high school student from Vermont"
47:13;47:16;"and a long time TC listener and Vampire Weekend head."
47:16;47:19;"Like any TC fan who abides by the core values,"
47:19;47:21;"I'm interested in corporate branding and history"
47:21;47:23;"and the tasteful palette of 70s rock."
47:23;47:25;"Love it, that's a great start to an email."
47:25;47:27;"However, I think you're ignoring the brand"
47:27;47:30;"that can give you both Ben and Jerry's."
47:30;47:31;"I've done some research and concluded"
47:31;47:34;"that they are very on brand for the time crisis community"
47:34;47:35;"and wanted to share."
47:35;47:36;"Very true."
47:36;47:37;"- Yeah, she's not wrong."
47:37;47:39;"Allow me to set the scene."
47:39;47:41;"I love when people set the scene."
47:41;47:43;"You know, I feel like that's also a very time crisis thing."
47:43;47:44;"It's like when we hear somebody's story,"
47:44;47:47;"it's kind of like, set the scene for us, man."
47:47;47:50;"Anyway, allow me to set the scene."
47:50;47:52;"In 1978, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield"
47:52;47:55;"commenced their first capitalist venture"
47:55;47:57;"and founded Ben and Jerry's, a bagel shop."
47:57;48:01;"Oh, okay, already Sophia's dropping bombshells."
48:01;48:05;"So Ben and Jerry's, these so-called ice cream guys,"
48:05;48:06;"they started with a bagel shop?"
48:06;48:07;"Okay."
48:07;48:09;"When producing bagels proved too pricey,"
48:09;48:11;"they became a small homemade ice cream shop"
48:11;48:14;"here in Burlington and became very popular statewide"
48:14;48:16;"because of the large chunks of toppings."
48:16;48:20;"That doesn't exactly sound appetizing."
48:20;48:25;"The very large chunks of toppings found in their ice cream."
48:25;48:28;"- So they were generous with like the cookie dough."
48:28;48:30;"- Yeah, I guess-- - And like the Oreos."
48:30;48:32;"- I guess before then, I mean, I'm guessing here,"
48:32;48:35;"1970, it's about the same time Sweet Martha started."
48:35;48:36;"- Wow."
48:36;48:37;"- I'm already loving this email."
48:37;48:39;"I've always kind of wondered that."
48:39;48:40;"Is Ben and Jerry's that good?"
48:40;48:42;"I mean, it's certainly good."
48:42;48:43;"But it's like-- - Yeah, it's great."
48:43;48:43;"- It's great?"
48:43;48:45;"Is it better than Haagen-Dazs?"
48:45;48:47;"- I can't weigh in."
48:47;48:47;"I'm not a-- - Right."
48:47;48:49;"Well, I've always-- - It seems like a lateral move."
48:49;48:50;"- I've always been curious about like,"
48:50;48:51;"what was their innovation?"
48:51;48:53;"Was it just the branding?"
48:53;48:56;"But maybe to start, what got people excited,"
48:56;49:00;"at least in Vermont, was the very large chunks of toppings."
49:00;49:02;"So, 'cause probably around that time,"
49:02;49:05;"I'm picturing 1978, I wasn't around,"
49:05;49:07;"that generally you go to the ice cream store,"
49:07;49:12;"you get a scoop of chocolate, vanilla, coffee,"
49:12;49:14;"maybe cookies and cream with a little something in it,"
49:14;49:17;"maybe you get some sprinkles, or jimmies,"
49:17;49:19;"as they're called in parts of the country, on top."
49:19;49:22;"But this concept that you might be eating a bowl"
49:22;49:25;"of ice cream and get like a straight up--"
49:25;49:26;"- Just bite."
49:26;49:28;"- Just big bite of like a--"
49:28;49:29;"- Butterscotch."
49:29;49:30;"- Butterscotch or whatever."
49:30;49:33;"That was a novel idea in 1978."
49:33;49:36;"So you can picture probably like, the buzz gets around,"
49:36;49:37;"kinda similar to fish, people are like,"
49:37;49:38;"you know when you see fish,"
49:38;49:40;"they don't repeat a lot of songs, that speaks to me."
49:40;49:41;"And somebody's like, you know what,"
49:41;49:43;"in Ben and Jerry's, we eat Ben and Jerry's,"
49:43;49:45;"you're gonna get very large chunks of toppings."
49:45;49:46;"- You know what I love to think about?"
49:46;49:47;"- What?"
49:47;49:50;"- Our man Bernie Sanders, walking into that first"
49:50;49:52;"Ben and Jerry's store around 1978."
49:52;49:53;"- Oh, 'cause he was there in Burlington."
49:53;49:54;"- Yeah."
49:54;49:55;"- He was about to be mayor."
49:55;49:56;"- Yeah, he was mayor in the early 80s."
49:56;49:57;"- He was like city councilman or something."
49:57;50:00;"- You know that like Bernie Sanders and Ben and Jerry"
50:00;50:02;"had like, hangouts."
50:02;50:03;"- Circa like 1981."
50:03;50:05;"- Ben and Jerry's campaigned for Bernie."
50:05;50:09;"Actually me and CT hung out with Ben and Jerry briefly."
50:09;50:10;"- Wow."
50:10;50:11;"- When we were campaigning for Bernie."
50:11;50:14;"So Bernie's walking in there, he's checking it out,"
50:14;50:17;"and he's like, alright, small business,"
50:17;50:19;"Bernie could support a small business."
50:19;50:20;"- Seems like a nice establishment."
50:20;50:22;"- Seems like a nice establishment."
50:22;50:25;"So you know, it's a little expensive,"
50:25;50:27;"but the very large--"
50:27;50:30;"- Little garish with these chunks of Butterfingers."
50:30;50:34;"- I don't know why the chunks of toppings are so large."
50:34;50:37;"I really lost my Bernie touch."
50:37;50:39;"Okay, let's get back to the email."
50:39;50:41;"The company began to gain momentum"
50:41;50:43;"throughout the early 1980s and grew into a national chain."
50:43;50:45;"Wonder what Bernie thought of that."
50:45;50:46;"- Didn't like it."
50:46;50:48;"- During this time, the Pillsbury-owned"
50:48;50:50;"Haagen-Dazs ice cream brand began"
50:50;50:52;"strong-arming distributors, saying they could not"
50:52;50:54;"sell both brands."
50:54;50:55;"Oh wow, this is gangster (beep)"
50:55;50:56;"- Yeah."
50:56;50:58;"- So Haagen-Dazs is strong-arming distributors,"
50:58;51:00;"saying they could not sell both brands."
51:00;51:01;"So just straight, that's amazing."
51:01;51:05;"Haagen-Dazs is like hitting up a local Vermont"
51:05;51:07;"frozen food distributor, and being like,"
51:07;51:09;"""We're pulling the plug on your supply, man."
51:09;51:11;"""If you keep selling Ben & Jerry's,"
51:11;51:12;"""we're not giving you Haagen-Dazs."""
51:12;51:13;"Trying to scare people."
51:13;51:15;"In response, Ben & Jerry's launched"
51:15;51:17;"the What's the Doughboy Afraid of campaign,"
51:17;51:20;"and bought anti-Haagen-Dazs ads on banner planes,"
51:20;51:22;"buses, and even the ice cream pints themselves."
51:22;51:24;"Eventually, enough angry people called Haagen-Dazs"
51:24;51:26;"to complain that they backed off,"
51:26;51:28;"and Ben & Jerry's grew even more commercially successful"
51:28;51:29;"through the '80s."
51:29;51:31;"David & Goliath story."
51:31;51:34;"Haagen-Dazs and Pillsbury tried to--"
51:34;51:36;"- Strong-arm. - Strong-arm them."
51:36;51:38;"Ben & Jerry's shamed them."
51:38;51:40;"Ben & Jerry's turned to the good people of Vermont,"
51:40;51:41;"and probably the whole Northeast, and said,"
51:41;51:44;"""Is this the kind of society we wanna live in?"
51:44;51:47;"""Where just a big company can tell us"
51:47;51:50;"""that we can't sell our ice cream?"""
51:50;51:52;"- I remember seeing a TV ad for Ben & Jerry's"
51:52;51:53;"in the mid '80s."
51:53;51:54;"- Yeah."
51:54;51:57;"- In the Northeast, and it was like so homemade."
51:57;51:59;"It was like these two beardos."
51:59;52:00;"- Yeah."
52:00;52:01;"- It was like, ""I'm Ben, I'm Jerry."
52:01;52:03;"""We're making,"" and there's these fat hippies,"
52:03;52:04;"and we're just like--"
52:04;52:05;"- ""We're making ice cream."""
52:05;52:06;"- ""We're making ice cream."""
52:06;52:08;"And it was just like, and then it cut to this funny,"
52:08;52:13;"just homemade screen of just the most awkward yellow font"
52:13;52:15;"on a green screen."
52:15;52:16;"Ben & Jerry's."
52:16;52:17;"- Just like public access style."
52:17;52:19;"- It was during a baseball game,"
52:19;52:21;"'cause that's all I watched when I was a kid."
52:21;52:23;"- And you were just like, ""Man, these guys seem cool."""
52:23;52:26;"- I remember thinking, ""Wow, this is cut rate,"
52:26;52:28;"""aesthetically,"" 'cause then it would be"
52:28;52:29;"professional ads after that."
52:29;52:32;"It would be an ad for a Ford dealership."
52:32;52:33;"- So you were just--"
52:33;52:33;"- Or like, ""Nobody Beats the Wiz."""
52:33;52:34;"- Okay, okay, but--"
52:34;52:36;"- And then it would just be like, in between that,"
52:36;52:40;"there'd be this cut rate, local access station"
52:40;52:41;"in Burlington."
52:41;52:42;"- You're just like, big sound effects,"
52:42;52:45;"and just like, ""You want a truck that's Ford tough?"""
52:45;52:46;"- Yeah."
52:46;52:48;"- And then it just comes in, ""Hey, man, I'm Ben."
52:48;52:50;"""I'm Jerry, man."""
52:50;52:52;"Wait, so you're 10 years old watching this,"
52:52;52:54;"and the effect it had on you,"
52:54;52:57;"you were already so acclimatized to big money ads,"
52:57;52:59;"that you turned to your mom and dad and be like,"
52:59;53:00;"""Those guys suck, I hate them."""
53:00;53:02;"- No, I was intrigued."
53:02;53:06;"It was super, kind of like my interest in lo-fi rock."
53:06;53:07;"I was drawn to it."
53:07;53:10;"I was like, ""Who are these guys?"""
53:10;53:12;"I remember the ad had terrible sound,"
53:12;53:14;"just like a (imitates noise)"
53:14;53:16;"Just like, the worst noise level."
53:16;53:19;"- It's like some Hollywood produced ad comes in,"
53:19;53:21;"and then suddenly, just like this hiss."
53:21;53:23;"(laughter)"
53:23;53:24;"- ""Hey, I'm Ben."""
53:24;53:25;"- ""I'm Ben."""

55:49;55:51;"Ben and Jerry's top marketing strategy"

56:08;56:09;"Wow."
56:09;56:10;"Just a reminder."
56:10;56:11;"- She's from Burlington."

56:48;56:51;"- Even Willie Nelson has his own flavor, Peach Cobbler."
56:51;56:53;"(laughing)"
56:53;56:53;"- Okay."
56:53;56:55;"- All right, that's cool."
56:55;56:57;"It's in recognition of his Southern roots."
56:57;56:58;"So they went to Willie--"
56:58;56:59;"- I thought he was from like Texas."
56:59;57:01;"- Texas is the South."
57:01;57:03;"- Yeah, it's not the South South, it's Texas."
57:03;57:04;"It's different."
57:04;57:05;"- Well, I don't know."
57:05;57:06;"- You say Peach, I think of the Allman Brothers."
57:06;57:08;"I think of Georgia."
57:08;57:09;"- Who knows where he's from originally."
57:09;57:10;"- I'm nitpicking, but it's like--"
57:10;57:12;"- Okay, but I think that was kind of funny too"
57:12;57:14;"to picture like Ben and Jerry's."
57:14;57:16;"They go to, they're starting to become known"
57:16;57:18;"for going to like kind of like the kind vibe old musicians."

57:45;57:47;"""Let's go 420 friendly on it, man."""
57:47;57:50;"- Oh yeah, Willie's also known for smoking up--"
57:50;57:52;"- He's known for smoking a lot of weed."
57:52;57:54;"He could have easily done the like--"
57:54;57:55;"- Satisfy My Bowl."
57:55;57:57;"- Satisfy My Bowl part two."
57:57;57:58;"But instead Willie Nelson says,"
57:58;57:59;"""What flavor do you want?"""
57:59;58:00;"He just said, ""Peach Cobbler."""
58:00;58:01;"- Phone and that one in."
58:01;58:03;"- Yeah, just Willie, like what, even for his name,"
58:03;58:05;"it could have been like Chili--"
58:05;58:07;"- I'm thinking Bloody Mary Morning, dude."
58:07;58:08;"- 'Cause that's his song, it's called Bloody Mary Morning."

58:10;58:12;"- So what are they gonna do, like a tomato based ice cream?"

58:15;58:17;"- Tomato based sorbet."

01:00:43;01:00:44;"Is that a thing?"
01:00:44;01:00:45;"Do they make grape ice cream?"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"- You could have a grape sorbet."
01:00:48;01:00:49;"- Okay."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"- What's it called, granita?"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"- I don't know."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"- It's a dessert."

01:01:02;01:01:03;"Oh, that's so obvious, yeah."
01:01:03;01:01:05;"It's gotta be raspberry sorbet."

01:01:06;01:01:07;"But I love grape ice cream"
01:01:07;01:01:10;"'cause it just sounds like made up and so dumb."

01:01:11;01:01:13;"- If Ben & Jerry's ever comes to me"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"and they wanna do a Vampire Weekend one,"
01:01:15;01:01:15;"- That would be sick."
01:01:15;01:01:18;"- It'd be like, ""Vampire Weekend grape ice cream."""
01:01:18;01:01:21;"(laughing)"
01:01:21;01:01:22;"- Not a big seller."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"(laughing)"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"- And the whole thing is that"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"it's the least popular ice cream they do."
01:01:27;01:01:31;"- Only available at the factory in cone form,"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"not available in pint form."
01:01:33;01:01:36;"- Ben & Jerry's produces over 10 pints a year"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"of Vampire Weekend grape ice cream."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"And they're losing their shirt on it."
01:01:40;01:01:41;"- Yeah."
01:01:41;01:01:42;"- It's just a money pit."
01:01:42;01:01:43;"(laughing)"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"The grape ice cream."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"- Oh my God, wait, so we,"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"our producer, Colin, just showed us an article."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"- Okay, hold the phone, Sophia."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"- Yeah, what's this?"
01:01:50;01:01:54;"- This is an article on Thrillist."
01:01:54;01:01:56;"This is why no one makes grape ice cream"
01:01:56;01:01:58;"according to Ben & Jerry's."
01:01:58;01:02:01;"As ubiquitous a flavor in snack foods,"
01:02:01;01:02:04;"grapes' absence from the ice cream world is glaring."
01:02:04;01:02:04;"- Seriously?"
01:02:04;01:02:06;"- There are some truly bat (beep) theories"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"as to why grapes haven't made the jump"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"from vine to pint."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"One is that grapes simply can't be frozen."
01:02:12;01:02:16;"Another is that grape ice cream puts dogs"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"who may accidentally eat it at risk."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"So it's--"
01:02:19;01:02:20;"- Wait, what?"
01:02:20;01:02:21;"- Okay, that's dumb."
01:02:21;01:02:25;"Grapes are difficult fruit because of the water content."
01:02:25;01:02:28;"But it's also not a very mainstream flavor for ice cream,"
01:02:28;01:02:29;"Greenwood said."
01:02:29;01:02:32;"Most people don't even associate grape with ice cream."
01:02:32;01:02:33;"People grew up on cherry and vanilla,"
01:02:33;01:02:36;"so now they love cherry-based ice cream."
01:02:36;01:02:40;"- Grape has not broken through the creme de glace ceiling,"
01:02:40;01:02:41;"if you will."
01:02:41;01:02:42;"Well, that's a lame answer."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"The whole point of Ben & Jerry's"
01:02:44;01:02:44;"is supposed to be a trailblazer."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"- Yeah, 'cause these are from some ex-hippies."
01:02:46;01:02:48;"That's a pretty establishment view, man."
01:02:48;01:02:49;"I just wanna say Ben & Jerry's,"
01:02:49;01:02:53;"so people of the Northeastern are saying to you,"
01:02:53;01:02:54;"why is there no grape ice cream?"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"And your answer is, you know, man,"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"it's not a very mainstream flavor."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"Don't rock the boat, man, you know?"
01:03:00;01:03:03;"It's kinda just, you know, take what you're given."
01:03:03;01:03:06;"- Cherry and grape seem pretty similar to me."
01:03:06;01:03:10;"Like, if you're doing a cherry ice cream, do a grape."
01:03:10;01:03:12;"- I love this grape ice cream thing,"
01:03:12;01:03:15;"and even though I don't know if it would taste good,"
01:03:15;01:03:17;"I wanna spearhead grape ice cream."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"It could be a Vampire Weekend thing,"
01:03:18;01:03:20;"it could be a Time Crisis thing."
01:03:20;01:03:21;"I just wanna--"
01:03:21;01:03:24;"- I feel like they need to get with some hipper bands."
01:03:24;01:03:24;"- Ben & Jerry's?"
01:03:24;01:03:28;"- Like, they hit the jam band East Coast scene pretty hard."
01:03:28;01:03:31;"- Yeah, it's time for some Vampire Weekend grape ice cream."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"And you know what?"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"Ben & Jerry's doesn't wanna do it, that's fine."
01:03:34;01:03:37;"- You know what they need to do is hook up with Ween."
01:03:37;01:03:38;"- Chocolate and cheese."
01:03:38;01:03:40;"- I always bring up Ween, but honestly, chocolate."
01:03:40;01:03:41;"(laughing)"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"- Chocolate and cheese."
01:03:43;01:03:47;"- But Ween is a perfect band to have a flavor at Ben & Jerry's"

01:04:50;01:04:51;"I love this grape ice cream idea, though."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"Thank you so much, Sophia."
01:04:53;01:04:54;"So she was talking about all the different bands,"
01:04:54;01:04:58;"the Fish Food, the Willie Nelson's Peach Cobbler."
01:04:58;01:05:00;"However, before there was any of these,"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"there was Cherry Garcia,"
01:05:02;01:05:03;"named for Time Crisis favorite"
01:05:03;01:05:06;"and Grateful Dead front man, Cherry Garcia."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"In 1986, Conan Greenfield received"
01:05:08;01:05:12;"an anonymous letter asking, according to Ben & Jerry's,"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"""Why don't you make a cherry flavor"
01:05:14;01:05:15;"""and call it Cherry Garcia?"
01:05:15;01:05:16;"""You know it will sell"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"""because dead paraphernalia always sells."
01:05:18;01:05:20;"""We are talking good business sense here"
01:05:20;01:05:23;"""and it will be a good hoot for the fans."""
01:05:23;01:05:24;"Okay."
01:05:24;01:05:26;"I love that, it's like 1986,"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"cracking open the mailbag,"
01:05:27;01:05:29;"Ben & Jerry's just get that,"
01:05:29;01:05:31;"make something called Cherry Garcia."
01:05:31;01:05:33;"And so, okay. - Not a bad idea."
01:05:33;01:05:34;"- Clearly they thought it was a good idea."
01:05:34;01:05:36;"The flavor launched in 1987."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"- Oh, it got right on it."
01:05:37;01:05:39;"- Yeah, and according to Ben & Jerry's,"
01:05:39;01:05:42;"Caroline Garcia called to give the flavor a thumbs up,"
01:05:42;01:05:45;"but still no word on what Jerry himself thought."
01:05:45;01:05:47;"Conan Greenfield received another letter that year"
01:05:47;01:05:48;"with the same handwriting,"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"this time on a Cherry Garcia lid."
01:05:50;01:05:53;"It was Jane Williamson, taking credit for her idea."
01:05:53;01:05:56;"In typical McDonald's Brothers fashion,"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"- Uh-oh."
01:05:57;01:05:59;"- The only compensation Williamson ever received"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"was a one year supply of Ben & Jerry's."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"- One year?"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"- Although, Cherry Garcia became the brand's"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"best selling flavor until 2016."
01:06:06;01:06:07;"- What? - And has inspired"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"the company's leading marketing technique,"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"all while continuing to self-identify"

01:06:59;01:07:01;"(laughs)"
01:07:01;01:07:02;"- That's a new drop we got."
01:07:02;01:07:03;"- Love it."
01:07:03;01:07:06;"- That's Yorma from The Lonely Island made that."
01:07:06;01:07:07;"- Oh, tight."
01:07:07;01:07:10;"- He'd been checking in on Tom Craces a little bit."
01:07:10;01:07:13;"Love Lonely Island, one of my all-time favorite bands."

01:07:14;01:07:16;"""Hey, if you guys ever need a drop, hit me up."""
01:07:16;01:07:18;"And I said, ""We would love a drop."""
01:07:18;01:07:19;"- Loved him on Girls."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"- And on Girls."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Actually, I acted with him in a scene on Girls."
01:07:22;01:07:24;"- Wait, what was his character name?"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"It was like--"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"- Jonathan or something?"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"He was like an artist."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"- But his last name was Jonathan?"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"- I can't remember."
01:07:31;01:07:32;"- It was like Powers Jonathan or something?"
01:07:32;01:07:33;"- Oh yeah, something like that."
01:07:33;01:07:35;"So comedian, actor, and musician."
01:07:35;01:07:37;"So thank you for that, Yorma."
01:07:37;01:07:38;"We appreciate it."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"We'll be playing that many times."
01:07:39;01:07:41;"So Corporate Food History."
01:07:41;01:07:46;"- 1995, Jerry dies and they abolish the CEO pay limit?"
01:07:46;01:07:49;"- Yeah."
01:07:49;01:07:50;"- That's perfect."
01:07:50;01:07:51;"- I don't know if I'm reading this sentence correctly yet."
01:07:51;01:07:54;"I don't know if she was trying to imply causation."
01:07:54;01:07:56;"- No, man, I think it's like the zeitgeist."
01:07:56;01:07:57;"- It was like--"
01:07:57;01:07:58;"- What was it again?"
01:07:58;01:08:00;"- Christmas '94, Ben and Jerry hanging out"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"with Jerry Garcia."
01:08:02;01:08:03;"And he's just like, ""You know, man,"
01:08:03;01:08:07;"""you know why I let you guys use my name to sell ice cream?"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"""'Cause you guys are cool, man."
01:08:09;01:08:12;"""You only make six times as much"
01:08:12;01:08:13;"""as the average worker at your company."
01:08:13;01:08:15;"""When you hear about these Wall Street fat cats"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"""making 200 times, that's pretty cool, man."""
01:08:17;01:08:19;"And they're like, ""Yeah, Jerry, that's what we're all about."""
01:08:19;01:08:22;"And he's just like, ""That's so cool, guys."
01:08:22;01:08:23;"""I really appreciate that."""
01:08:23;01:08:26;"Six months later, the man dies."
01:08:26;01:08:27;"- They're like, ""You know what?"""
01:08:27;01:08:28;"- You know what?"
01:08:28;01:08:32;"- So in 1995, the lowest wage worker, Ben and Jerry's,"
01:08:32;01:08:33;"is like, what do you think they're making?"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"Like 18,000 a year?"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"- They might've been doing six times"
01:08:37;01:08:38;"that of the average worker."
01:08:38;01:08:41;"So maybe the average worker's making 25 grand, I don't know."
01:08:41;01:08:43;"- Okay, so they're making like--"
01:08:43;01:08:44;"- 150 a year each?"
01:08:44;01:08:45;"- Yeah."
01:08:45;01:08:46;"- That's not a lot for when you're owning"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"a huge, huge company like that."
01:08:48;01:08:51;"- That's a pretty big temptation for any human being."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"Do you think that you'd be able to stay the course, man?"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"You start an ice cream company,"
01:08:55;01:08:56;"and you're making good money."
01:08:56;01:09:00;"Let's make it by like modern standards."
01:09:00;01:09:01;"You start an ice cream company,"
01:09:01;01:09:02;"you're making good money, man."
01:09:02;01:09:04;"You're making 300 grand."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"Any American who's making 300 grand--"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"- Is doing great. - Is doing great."
01:09:08;01:09:11;"But at the same time, you start making 300 grand,"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"you know, maybe you move to a nicer house,"
01:09:13;01:09:16;"now you gotta pay the butlers, all these things."
01:09:16;01:09:19;"Suddenly your monthly burn is going way up."
01:09:19;01:09:20;"- Yep."
01:09:20;01:09:24;"- You start hanging out with Dave Matthews, Willie Nelson."
01:09:24;01:09:27;"Dave Matthews is like, ""Hey man, I'm taking a yacht"
01:09:27;01:09:31;"""around the Mediterranean this summer, love for you to join."""
01:09:31;01:09:33;"And you're like, ""Oh, I'd love to too."""
01:09:33;01:09:35;"And he's like, ""Yeah man, if you just fly out,"

01:09:42;01:09:44;"""it's gonna cost $15,000 right there."""

01:09:51;01:09:53;"Little by little, you start to be more and more"
01:09:53;01:09:55;"disconnected from the average worker."
01:09:55;01:09:58;"You're living that Dave Matthews lifestyle."
01:09:58;01:10:00;"Are you gonna one day look at Jerry--"
01:10:00;01:10:01;"- It's not worth it, man."
01:10:01;01:10:04;"- And just say, ""You know what, dude?"""
01:10:04;01:10:06;"Would you bump your salary up?"
01:10:06;01:10:07;"- It's not worth it, man."
01:10:07;01:10:08;"- What's not worth it?"
01:10:08;01:10:11;"- Not if your reputation is grounded in the fact"
01:10:11;01:10:12;"that you're a local--"
01:10:12;01:10:13;"- Okay, but you're--"
01:10:13;01:10:15;"- You're a local company where you're representing"
01:10:15;01:10:16;"the sort of--"
01:10:16;01:10:17;"- The working person."
01:10:17;01:10:18;"- Exactly."
01:10:18;01:10:21;"- But you're telling me that the fact that maybe"
01:10:21;01:10:25;"a few Burlington lefty types might be dragging"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"your name through the mud, is that gonna really"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"harsh you out when you're just--"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"- Well, look at Sophia's email, man."
01:10:31;01:10:32;"- You're coasting through the Mediterranean"
01:10:32;01:10:35;"on Dave Matthews' yacht, eating lobsters,"
01:10:35;01:10:36;"shrimps, and steak."
01:10:36;01:10:39;"You're just cruising, looking at a beautiful"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"crystal clear blue water."
01:10:41;01:10:44;"Dave is literally just playing Crash"
01:10:44;01:10:45;"on an acoustic guitar next to you."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"You really think that you're gonna be thinking"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"about the little guy back in Burlington?"
01:10:49;01:10:53;"- What I'm saying is the hit on your reputation"
01:10:53;01:10:55;"is not worth it if that's what you built"
01:10:55;01:10:56;"your reputation on."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"Look at Sophia's email."
01:10:57;01:11:02;"She's a high school student in 2017 writing this email."
01:11:02;01:11:03;"- Yeah."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"- With this sort of embittered attitude"
01:11:05;01:11:08;"towards Ben and Jerry's, a local company."
01:11:08;01:11:08;"- Right."
01:11:08;01:11:11;"- And she's like, ""Look at these clowns,"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"""these fat hippies, they sold out."""
01:11:13;01:11:14;"- She doesn't like fish either."
01:11:14;01:11:19;"- Oh, Sophia's got her head screwed on straight."
01:12:34;01:12:36;"- Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:12:36;01:12:38;"Beats."
01:12:38;01:12:41;"One."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"- That's funny."
01:12:42;01:12:43;"- What?"
01:12:43;01:12:44;"- Think about people who are like,"
01:12:44;01:12:47;"pissed at Ben and Jerry's."
01:12:47;01:12:48;"- Yeah."
01:12:48;01:12:49;"- For quote unquote selling out."
01:12:49;01:12:50;"- Yeah."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"- And then they're like, ""It's still really good though."""
01:12:52;01:12:53;"- Oh yeah, of course."
01:12:53;01:12:55;"- They're like in the 7-Eleven,"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"like a little drunk or something,"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"and they're just like, ""Oh man, chunky monkey."""
01:12:59;01:13:00;"- Yeah."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"I mean look, when you're getting high,"
01:13:03;01:13:04;"lot of different ways to say it."
01:13:04;01:13:05;"- On your own supply."
01:13:05;01:13:07;"- Getting high on your own supply."
01:13:07;01:13:10;"Especially these days, kids like to hit dabs,"
01:13:10;01:13:11;"get you real high."
01:13:11;01:13:13;"So you're walking over to that 7-Eleven,"
01:13:13;01:13:14;"you're real high."
01:13:14;01:13:16;"You're probably feeling a little paranoid, man,"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"if Ben and Jerry's sold out,"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"who's to say that everybody around me hasn't sold out?"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"Maybe this whole thing's a simulation."
01:13:22;01:13:24;"Maybe Ben and Jerry's,"
01:13:24;01:13:27;"based on their trajectory from 1978 to the present,"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"became such a huge evil corporation,"
01:13:29;01:13:30;"that they eventually created the simulation"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"that we all live in."
01:13:32;01:13:33;"And are harvesting organs from us"
01:13:33;01:13:35;"in some Matrix-like reality."
01:13:35;01:13:37;"So you might be having all sorts of weird paranoid thoughts,"
01:13:37;01:13:40;"but at the same time, when those munchies kick in,"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"and you're looking at the ice cream section,"
01:13:42;01:13:45;"and you know you want very large chunks of toppings"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"in your ice cream,"
01:13:47;01:13:48;"you're not gonna get Haagen-Dazs, man."
01:13:48;01:13:49;"Not gonna get Friars."
01:13:49;01:13:52;"- Outlandishly sized chunks of Butterfingers"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"in your ice cream."
01:13:54;01:13:56;"- I should have known."
01:13:56;01:13:59;"- Outlandishly sized."
01:13:59;01:14:03;"- It's like, Bernie turns on Ben and Jerry's."
01:14:03;01:14:07;"I should have known in 1978,"
01:14:07;01:14:12;"when I first encountered the outlandishly large"
01:14:12;01:14:17;"chunks of Butterfingers in your ice cream,"
01:14:17;01:14:20;"that your greed knew no bounds."
01:14:20;01:14:23;"- Ben and Jerry's recently announced"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"they'll be introducing a new flavor,"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"Rockstar Energy Drink."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"(laughing)"
01:14:29;01:14:32;"- Teaming up with Five Hour Energy."
01:14:32;01:14:34;"Ben and Jerry's."
01:14:34;01:14:36;"- Full time crisis."
01:14:36;01:14:37;"- Coming full circle."
01:14:37;01:14:39;"- Five Hour Energy, Ben and Jerry's."
01:14:39;01:14:40;"- That's sick."
01:14:40;01:14:42;"Anyway, back to Sophia's email."
01:14:42;01:14:43;"I just thought it was interesting"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"how two self-identified deadhead hippies"
01:14:45;01:14:49;"decided to try their hands at brass knuckled capitalism,"
01:14:49;01:14:50;"and still support liberal politics,"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"despite profiting from right-wing"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"corporate dirtbag activity."
01:14:54;01:14:56;"And I thought you guys might too."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"Thanks for taking the time to read my email."
01:14:57;01:14:59;"Love the show, Sophia."
01:14:59;01:15:00;"P.S. An eight minute Hannah Hunt"
01:15:00;01:15:01;"would make an excellent addition"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"to the next waves of vampire shows."
01:15:03;01:15:06;"That's what I'm talking about."
01:15:06;01:15:06;"I love that."
01:15:06;01:15:07;"- I'm pumped."
01:15:07;01:15:12;"- Not only is Sophia supporting the LP4,"
01:15:12;01:15:15;"eight minute VW era,"
01:15:15;01:15:17;"she's also awakening us to what's happening"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"behind the scenes in Burlington."
01:15:19;01:15:24;"Okay, I mean, is it fair to say that Ben and Jerry's"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"are doing brass knuckled capitalism?"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"- I don't know."
01:15:28;01:15:29;"- I guess the bar is so low these days."
01:15:29;01:15:33;"- It's sort of like, to expand your business"
01:15:33;01:15:36;"beyond the bounds of what you originally thought possible,"
01:15:36;01:15:41;"is that contradictory ethically to being a liberal?"
01:15:41;01:15:44;"I don't know."
01:15:44;01:15:45;"No, we live in a capitalistic society."
01:15:45;01:15:46;"I mean."
01:15:46;01:15:50;"- Maybe there's an inherent contradiction"
01:15:50;01:15:53;"in being capitalistical liberal."
01:15:53;01:15:54;"- They're businessmen."
01:15:54;01:15:55;"- Yeah."
01:15:55;01:15:57;"Can you be a kind of vibe businessman?"
01:15:57;01:15:58;"That's the question."
01:15:58;01:15:59;"- Outlandish chunks."
01:15:59;01:16:02;"- These outlandish chunks."
01:16:02;01:16:06;"- Yeah, I mean the five hour energy guy."
01:16:06;01:16:09;"- Many of our citizens in Burlington"
01:16:09;01:16:13;"have to eat generic store-bought ice cream,"
01:16:13;01:16:18;"flavors like vanilla, chocolate, strawberry,"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"nary a chunk to be found,"

01:16:23;01:16:24;"Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield."
01:16:24;01:16:27;"- Are gorging themselves."
01:16:27;01:16:32;"- On outlandishly large chunks of Heath bars,"

01:16:42;01:16:43;"ice cream, peach cobbler."
01:16:43;01:16:51;"- In fact, I hear a word of a Jimmy Buffet themed ice cream"
01:16:51;01:16:55;"with outlandishly large chunks of frozen banana."

01:17:46;01:17:47;"- Yep."

01:18:16;01:18:17;"- At the Minnesota State Fair."

01:22:29;01:22:30;"OK."
01:22:30;01:22:33;"The number four song is by a guy called Jon Stewart."
01:22:33;01:22:34;"The song is called ""Gold."""

01:22:35;01:22:36;"Oh, I know this."
01:22:37;01:22:42;"This is some classic Sirius XM bridge station."
01:22:42;01:22:45;"Oh, they say Stevie Nicks is on this song."
01:22:45;01:22:46;"Oh, and Lindsey Buckingham produced it."
01:22:46;01:22:51;"I mean--"

01:23:09;01:23:10;"Was he an older guy?"
01:23:10;01:23:14;"I think he was like a '60s folk singer."
01:23:14;01:23:15;"And here's the thing."
01:23:15;01:23:18;"I even want to say Jon Stewart wrote songs for like the Monkees."
01:23:18;01:23:19;"Oh, wow."
01:23:19;01:23:22;"(SINGING) --and we're riding over Canaan."
01:23:22;01:23:23;"There's Stevie."
01:23:23;01:23:24;"I could be wrong on that."
01:23:24;01:23:26;"I feel like Jon Stewart wrote ""Daydream Believer."""
01:23:26;01:23:27;"Oh, wow."
01:23:27;01:23:28;"But I could be wrong on that."

01:23:33;01:23:36;"(SINGING) Yeah, my buddy Jim Batts, he's a working pump"
01:23:36;01:23:41;"and gas, and he makes $2.50 for an hour."
01:23:41;01:23:43;"Yeah, let's raise a big in his hands--"
01:23:43;01:23:46;"I like he sounds like an old folk singer here."
01:23:46;01:23:47;"He sounds super old."
01:23:47;01:23:48;"(MUMBLING) Yeah, probably."
01:23:48;01:23:50;"I was actually really shocked when his voice came in."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"It was like this kind of--"
01:23:52;01:23:53;"Weird that that was a hit."
01:23:53;01:23:54;"This like chilled out Fleetwood Mac."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"(SINGING) --the music in the cold."

01:24:03;01:24:04;"You know what it kind of sounds like?"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"It sounds like some weird--"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"actually, this is very disrespectful,"
01:24:08;01:24:09;"because I think it's cool."
01:24:09;01:24:10;"I've got to be clear about that."
01:24:10;01:24:13;"But if you told me that was like a weird bootleg"
01:24:13;01:24:17;"tape of an older dude doing Neil Young karaoke,"
01:24:17;01:24:20;"and this is like some Neil Young song I didn't know--"
01:24:20;01:24:21;"(SINGING) --no, no, no."
01:24:21;01:24:22;"It's like a very Neil Young melody."
01:24:22;01:24:23;"Yeah."
01:24:23;01:24:26;"(SINGING) The story is there for the taking."
01:24:26;01:24:28;"And I'm driving over camp--"

01:24:29;01:24:33;"My uncle sometimes gets [bleep] faced on the weekends."

01:24:35;01:24:37;"weird Neil Young karaoke."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"And I like taped a little bit on my phone."
01:24:38;01:24:39;"It's cool, though."

01:24:49;01:24:53;"OK, and the number four song on the charts right now."
01:24:53;01:24:54;"Oh, it's a rock song."
01:24:54;01:24:56;"You're going to like this one, Jake."
01:24:56;01:24:58;"All right."
01:24:58;01:25:00;"Rock's not dead."

01:25:11;01:25:13;"I love the John Stewart into this."
01:25:13;01:25:14;"Yeah."
01:25:14;01:25:17;"(SINGING) The way that things are going."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"So much more like professional."
01:25:18;01:25:20;"I know."
01:25:20;01:25:21;"(SINGING) Second thing, second, don't you"
01:25:21;01:25:24;"tell me what you think that I can be."
01:25:24;01:25:25;"I'm the one at the sale."

01:25:31;01:25:32;"Have you seen the music video for this song?"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"No."
01:25:33;01:25:34;"What's that?"
01:25:34;01:25:35;"Is it a good video, Seinfeld?"
01:25:35;01:25:36;"It's awful."
01:25:36;01:25:38;"Dolph Lundgren is in it."
01:25:38;01:25:40;"Oh, that's cool."
01:25:40;01:25:42;"It looks like it costs like $300 to $400 to make."

01:25:50;01:25:50;"Oh, OK."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"It's like that."
01:25:52;01:25:54;"You got to be careful about that."
01:25:54;01:25:57;"It looks like a weird Spanish language soap opera."
01:25:57;01:25:59;"Yeah, there's like a boxing narrative."
01:25:59;01:25:59;"Whoa."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"It's like multi-layered."
01:26:01;01:26:01;"What was that?"

01:26:15;01:26:17;"This is great music for like a bad boy pro baseball"

01:26:22;01:26:24;"Spit on the ground."
01:26:24;01:26:26;"Now batting."

01:26:34;01:26:36;"I don't know if anyone still chews tobacco."
01:26:36;01:26:40;"6'5"", 245 pounds."
01:26:40;01:26:43;"They don't announce that when you're going to bat."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"That'd be amazing."
01:26:46;01:26:48;"Now batting for the Minnesota Twins, Chuck Knobloch."
01:26:48;01:26:53;"5'3"", 160."
01:26:53;01:26:54;"They don't do that in baseball?"
01:26:54;01:26:55;"No."
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Wait, but I feel like I've been to a baseball game--"
01:26:57;01:26:58;"Boxing."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"OK, but I feel like I've been to a baseball game"
01:27:00;01:27:03;"where they, on the screen, they might say the guy's"
01:27:03;01:27:04;"hiding away."
01:27:04;01:27:05;"Oh, yeah, they might have that on the screen,"
01:27:05;01:27:08;"but they don't announce it."
01:27:08;01:27:09;"OK, well, I think--"
01:27:09;01:27:13;"So many baseball players are just like--"
01:27:13;01:27:17;"Now batting, John Crook, 5'11"", 280 pounds."
01:27:17;01:27:23;"Shout out to Imagine Dragons."
01:27:23;01:27:24;"Oh, my god."
01:27:24;01:27:25;"I also want to point out to a lot of people"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"out there who think it's Imagination Dragons,"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"it's Imagine Dragons."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"You could keep that extra syllable to yourself."
01:27:31;01:27:33;"Ezra, if you were a major league ballplayer,"
01:27:33;01:27:36;"what would be your walk-up music?"
01:27:36;01:27:39;"Besides Imagine Dragons, I'm a believer."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"I'm trying to be serious."
01:27:40;01:27:42;"If I randomly was actually good at baseball"
01:27:42;01:27:43;"and I was still myself--"
01:27:43;01:27:44;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:27:44;01:27:46;"If you were just really good--"
01:27:46;01:27:47;"If I just had--"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"You got drafted out of high school."
01:27:49;01:27:50;"If I had a rookie of the year scenario,"
01:27:50;01:27:53;"I broke my arm, and then suddenly my pitch got crazy."
01:27:53;01:27:56;"You were the top-rated pitcher in high school."
01:27:56;01:27:58;"OK, all right, but that gets confusing,"
01:27:58;01:27:59;"because then I'm like, well, who am I?"
01:27:59;01:28:00;"No, no, no, no."
01:28:00;01:28:01;"How did I get so good?"
01:28:01;01:28:02;"I want the--"
01:28:02;01:28:03;"Pay me the picture."
01:28:03;01:28:05;"No, but OK, it's still your same taste in music."
01:28:05;01:28:06;"OK."
01:28:06;01:28:09;"And then you're like 21, and you're a rookie"
01:28:09;01:28:10;"on the New York Yankees."
01:28:10;01:28:11;"OK, OK."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"I'm trying to be really--"
01:28:13;01:28:14;"So sincere."
01:28:14;01:28:15;"--take this seriously."
01:28:15;01:28:18;"Realistically, if I had randomly been great at baseball,"
01:28:18;01:28:22;"and then I somehow was like playing for the Yankees at 21,"
01:28:22;01:28:27;"probably my thing, especially back then in the mid-2000s,"
01:28:27;01:28:30;"I would have to be the hipster baseball player."
01:28:30;01:28:32;"Well, I would have two choices, because around that same time"
01:28:32;01:28:35;"in my life, I was getting interested in preppy fashion."
01:28:35;01:28:38;"So either I could have started a preppy band,"
01:28:38;01:28:39;"or I could have been the preppy baseball--"
01:28:39;01:28:42;"maybe hipster versus preppy baseball player."
01:28:42;01:28:44;"Because, yeah, other guys have so much personality,"
01:28:44;01:28:47;"it might be based on where they're from,"
01:28:47;01:28:48;"if they're from another country."
01:28:48;01:28:49;"That can be part of--"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"Sure."
01:28:50;01:28:52;"--the mystique, some of them."
01:28:52;01:28:53;"Or even if they're from America, there's"
01:28:53;01:28:57;"the kind of like guy who could be like from down south,"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"Kenny Powers type dude."
01:28:59;01:29:03;"But for me, I'm just a guy from New Jersey"
01:29:03;01:29:04;"playing for the Yankees."
01:29:04;01:29:06;"If I really want to make a splash,"
01:29:06;01:29:07;"I'd have to kind of come out."
01:29:07;01:29:10;"So yeah, I would have the choice between being the hipster"
01:29:10;01:29:11;"Yankee or the preppy Yankee."
01:29:11;01:29:13;"Either way, I'd be kind of like a villain."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"So I might as well play it up, kind of like"
01:29:15;01:29:17;"professional wrestling style."
01:29:17;01:29:19;"I actually probably know more about the WWE"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"than I know about baseball anyway."
01:29:21;01:29:23;"So I would be the preppy Yankee, and I"
01:29:23;01:29:26;"would wear like a pink polo shirt under my Yankees uniform"
01:29:26;01:29:27;"and pop it."
01:29:27;01:29:28;"Not an option."
01:29:28;01:29:31;"And I would come out--"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"Ownership's going to lose their mind."
01:29:33;01:29:36;"--super WWE, this is like super pro wrestling."
01:29:36;01:29:39;"When I would come out after like, you know,"
01:29:39;01:29:40;"Kenny Powers comes out--"
01:29:40;01:29:41;"So you're a pitcher."
01:29:41;01:29:42;"--comes to-- no, no."
01:29:42;01:29:43;"Well, this is me coming to bat."
01:29:43;01:29:44;"OK, yeah."
01:29:44;01:29:46;"So after Kenny Powers comes out and strikes out"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"to Imagination Dragons, then I come out."
01:29:48;01:29:52;"And then they just play like some classical music,"
01:29:52;01:29:53;"like the Masterpiece Theater music."
01:29:53;01:29:54;"Oh my god."
01:29:54;01:29:55;"But then also--"
01:29:55;01:29:58;"You have a tray with Grey Poupon on it."
01:29:58;01:30:02;"Yeah, no, but also before I come out, my butler--"
01:30:02;01:30:05;"I get like my buddy to dress up as a butler,"
01:30:05;01:30:07;"and he comes out."
01:30:07;01:30:10;"He has a little brush, and he brushes the plate for me."
01:30:10;01:30:11;"Oh my god."
01:30:11;01:30:12;"And then he kind of brushes my way as I come,"
01:30:12;01:30:13;"and I say, thank you."
01:30:13;01:30:15;"Everybody's just booing."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"It's like, oh, I hate that guy."
01:30:17;01:30:20;"And then I'm kind of listening, and I'm just kind of like--"
01:30:20;01:30:21;"you know, I'm just being a pro wrestler."
01:30:21;01:30:24;"I'm looking at the crowd, and I'm like, oh, you don't like me?"
01:30:24;01:30:26;"Oh, I don't care."
01:30:26;01:30:29;"And then I'll be sitting like, very good, Jeeves."
01:30:29;01:30:30;"You may leave."
01:30:30;01:30:32;"And then I knock it out of the park, and everybody's just"
01:30:32;01:30:34;"like, oh, I hate this guy."
01:30:34;01:30:36;"Then you pop up to second base."
01:30:36;01:30:38;"That's the problem."
01:30:38;01:30:39;"That's why baseball players can't do that stuff,"
01:30:39;01:30:42;"because they're like-- are always just like striking."
01:30:42;01:30:44;"What does that mean, to pop up to second base?"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"Like, you just like hit a pop-up."
01:30:46;01:30:47;"Oh, and then they--"
01:30:47;01:30:48;"And the second baseman just catches it."
01:30:48;01:30:50;"Like, this is the most undramatic ending to a bat."
01:30:50;01:30:51;"Wait, what?"
01:30:51;01:30:52;"Baseball--"
01:30:52;01:30:53;"There's no way you could do--"
01:30:53;01:30:55;"People find baseball so boring."
01:30:55;01:30:57;"Wouldn't it be so funny if baseball players could--"
01:30:57;01:30:58;"But this is what I'm saying."
01:30:58;01:30:59;"--be more like wrestlers?"
01:30:59;01:31:00;"I love the idea."
01:31:00;01:31:01;"I think it's hilarious."
01:31:01;01:31:03;"But the problem is, you can't front like that,"
01:31:03;01:31:07;"and then you're failing at best like 67% of the time."
01:31:07;01:31:08;"Right, because--"
01:31:08;01:31:09;"Because like--"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"--in wrestling, you can choreograph what happens."
01:31:11;01:31:12;"But like, the best baseball players"
01:31:12;01:31:17;"are still going to like strike out, ground out, whatever."
01:31:17;01:31:19;"And so like, after all that sort of pomp and circumstance,"
01:31:19;01:31:22;"you can't just like ground out on the second pitch."
01:31:22;01:31:23;"Right, well--"
01:31:23;01:31:24;"You just look like an idiot."
01:31:24;01:31:25;"OK, we would start--"
01:31:25;01:31:26;"Every bat--"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"Right, we would have to start making baseball fake."
01:31:28;01:31:30;"You have like 600 bats a year."
01:31:30;01:31:32;"Every time."
01:31:32;01:31:34;"[interposing voices]"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"I was just-- you imagine that I was like--"
01:31:36;01:31:38;"and I was like a funny name."
01:31:38;01:31:40;"People say baseball's long now."
01:31:40;01:31:41;"Right."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"I was like--"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"the games become five hours with all"
01:31:45;01:31:46;"this like pomp and circumstance."
01:31:46;01:31:48;"Make baseball fake."
01:31:48;01:31:48;"Yeah."
01:31:48;01:31:51;"My baseball title, I'm Lord Hataway."
01:31:51;01:31:52;"Oh my god."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"That's my name."
01:31:53;01:31:54;"So then you're like, at bat--"
01:31:54;01:31:57;"At bat."
01:31:57;01:31:59;"--at six feet tall--"
01:31:59;01:32:00;"I want to show away."
01:32:00;01:32:02;"--165 pounds."
01:32:02;01:32:03;"You're bulked up."
01:32:03;01:32:04;"I'm bulked up at that point."
01:32:04;01:32:05;"185."
01:32:05;01:32:08;"185 pounds of pure muscle."
01:32:08;01:32:09;"Lord Hataway."
01:32:09;01:32:11;"It's like an away game."
01:32:11;01:32:13;"We're playing in Boston."
01:32:13;01:32:18;"The Red Sox fans are like, oh god, I hate this guy."
01:32:18;01:32:20;"Just like I come out like, oh, what's that?"
01:32:20;01:32:21;"What did you say?"
01:32:21;01:32:27;"You're in the dugout later with your homemade grape ice cream."
01:32:27;01:32:27;"Oh, yeah."
01:32:27;01:32:29;"Just--"
01:32:29;01:32:30;"I'm going to get out of this."
01:32:30;01:32:33;"I've got like a little scarf on and the camera's fidgeting."
01:32:33;01:32:35;"It looks like Lord Hataway's eating"
01:32:35;01:32:38;"some homemade grape ice cream."
01:32:38;01:32:39;"My butler's right next to me."
01:32:39;01:32:44;"Yo, that would be so sick if baseball was more like that."
01:32:44;01:32:47;"After every home run that Lord Hataway hits,"
01:32:47;01:32:53;"he hits his grape ice cream as a celebratory scoop."
01:32:53;01:32:55;"I knock it right out of the park."
01:32:55;01:32:57;"Knock it right out."
01:32:57;01:33:00;"That expression."
01:33:00;01:33:02;"Your ease with baseball lingo."
01:33:02;01:33:03;"It's like 1920s."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"You knock it right out of the park."
01:33:05;01:33:08;"I knock it right--"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"I knock it right out of the park."
01:33:10;01:33:11;"And everybody's like, home run."
01:33:11;01:33:13;"And everybody in Boston is like groaning."
01:33:13;01:33:15;"Like, oh my god, I hate the Yankees."
01:33:15;01:33:16;"And I especially hate Lord Hataway."
01:33:16;01:33:18;"And then everybody's like, all right."
01:33:18;01:33:19;"And I'm just standing there."
01:33:19;01:33:22;"And the umpire's like, all right, round the bases."
01:33:22;01:33:23;"Round the bases, Lord Hataway."
01:33:23;01:33:26;"And I'm just like, put up my finger like, one minute."
01:33:26;01:33:29;"The bubble comes back out with the grape ice cream."
01:33:29;01:33:31;"And I just have to take a few spoonfuls."
01:33:31;01:33:33;"Like, [smacking lips]"
01:33:33;01:33:35;"And I just-- I very slowly walk around."
01:33:35;01:33:39;"People are just like throwing bananas at me."
01:33:39;01:33:41;"Let's make baseball fake."
01:33:41;01:33:44;"Fake baseball with more characters."
01:33:44;01:33:45;"There could be a guy who comes out."
01:33:45;01:33:46;"He's like a knight."
01:33:46;01:33:48;"He bats with like a sword."
01:33:48;01:33:50;"[laughter]"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"There could be like--"
01:33:52;01:33:53;"Bats with a sword."
01:33:53;01:33:56;"There could be like scary guys like The Undertaker."
01:33:56;01:34:00;"Maybe his baseball bat looks like it's like a bone."
01:34:00;01:34:01;"It's got face paint on it."
01:34:01;01:34:03;"Maybe like a relief pitcher that comes in and like"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"douses the ball and gas lights it."
01:34:05;01:34:06;"Yeah, just throws it."
01:34:06;01:34:07;"A fireball."
01:34:07;01:34:08;"Maybe we could do like Summer League,"
01:34:08;01:34:10;"like Cape Cod Summer League."
01:34:10;01:34:11;"Except it's like--"
01:34:11;01:34:12;"Cape Cod, dude."
01:34:12;01:34:15;"It's Ezra and Jake's Time Crisis Presents Fake Baseball."
01:34:15;01:34:19;"And it's just like people-- yeah, throwing the balls on fire."
01:34:19;01:34:19;"Yeah."
01:34:19;01:34:22;"[laughter]"
01:34:22;01:34:23;"Animals."
01:34:23;01:34:24;"Dudes are in armor."
01:34:24;01:34:25;"Yeah."
01:34:25;01:34:28;"[laughter]"
01:34:28;01:34:29;"I love this idea."
01:34:29;01:34:30;"OK."

01:34:32;01:34:38;"The number three song in 1979 was Barbara Streisand."

01:38:13;01:38:14;"No."
01:38:14;01:38:15;"Is that what he said?"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"He said, I had enough gumbo."
01:38:17;01:38:21;"He says, I had enough convo for 24."
01:38:21;01:38:22;"What do you think that means?"
01:38:22;01:38:24;"OK, he's talked enough for 24 hours."
01:38:24;01:38:25;"Yeah."
01:38:25;01:38:28;"I thought he meant he ate enough gumbo for 24 people."

01:49:55;01:49:58;"it's literally the last verse of ""Rapper's Delight,"""
01:49:58;01:50:01;"so it's far and away the most forgotten verse,"
01:50:01;01:50:03;"'cause that's a long song, and there's--"
01:50:03;01:50:05;"the ones that people always quote literally every other verse,"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"but then you actually read through the whole thing."
01:50:07;01:50:09;"It's a full story."
01:50:09;01:50:11;"It's like he sets the stage, you go to ""Friends,"""
01:50:11;01:50:13;"I see the food, and it's like--"
01:50:13;01:50:15;"there's like these twists and turns"
01:50:15;01:50:17;"that it's like your heart starts pumping,"
01:50:17;01:50:19;"and you think of a line, and you say that you already ate."
01:50:19;01:50:21;"""All right, I think I'm out of--"""
01:50:21;01:50:23;"""Hey, you know what, guys? I already ate."""
01:50:23;01:50:25;"And then your friend says, ""Oh, Mom, he's just being polite,"""
01:50:25;01:50:27;"and they give you more food."
01:50:27;01:50:29;"- Pile some more on your plate. - And then you just gotta leave"
01:50:29;01:50:31;"'cause it's so gross, and then--"
01:50:31;01:50:33;"I love, like, the stinger, so you're just out of there,"
01:50:33;01:50:35;"you're like, ""Guys, I gotta leave, I'm sorry."""
01:50:35;01:50:37;"Then you go drink some Kaopectate,"
01:50:37;01:50:39;"and then, two weeks later,"
01:50:39;01:50:42;"you call your friend to see how he has been."
01:50:42;01:50:44;"He says, ""I understand about the food,"
01:50:44;01:50:46;"but we're still friends."""
01:50:46;01:50:49;"It's like this kind of touching ending to that verse."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"Also, I think I like that verse, too,"
01:50:51;01:50:55;"because I feel like if I was a member of the Sugarhill Gang,"
01:50:55;01:50:58;"I feel like I probably would have done a verse like that."
01:50:58;01:51:01;"Like, everybody else would be doing kind of, like,"
01:51:01;01:51:03;"the cool, like, cutting-edge verses,"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"and they'd be like, ""What's your verse?"""
01:51:05;01:51:07;"- And be like, ""Well--"" - Home Depot run."
01:51:07;01:51:10;"Yeah, as opposed to you guys, I'm gonna do a little storytelling."
01:51:10;01:51:13;"- Yeah, yeah. - You ever go out for a depot run?"
01:51:13;01:51:16;"- ( laughs ) - I can't even think of anything."
01:51:16;01:51:19;"Anyway, ""Good Times by Sheep,"" great song."
01:51:19;01:51:22;"""Rapper's Delight,"" maybe even better song."
01:51:22;01:51:25;"And shout-out to whoever did that final verse"
01:51:25;01:51:28;"about the bad food, 'cause I love that verse."
01:51:28;01:51:30;"And I identify with it."
01:51:30;01:51:34;"The number one song, big surprise on the billboard right now."
01:51:34;01:51:36;"The song of the summer, ""Unequivocally."""
01:51:36;01:51:39;"( music playing )"
01:51:39;01:51:45;"What's going on with Bieber?"
01:51:45;01:51:47;"I don't know. We just--"
01:51:47;01:51:50;"I think, you know, we talked last time, he canceled the tour,"
01:51:50;01:51:55;"and I'm kind of curious about this new church that he's a part of."
01:51:55;01:51:57;"I'd like to find out more about what they believe in"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"and things like that."

01:52:53;01:52:55;"It just doesn't do much for me."
01:52:55;01:52:58;"Which was better this week, the songs from 2017 or 1979?"
01:52:58;01:53:01;"Oof. God, both kind of brutal."
01:53:01;01:53:04;"I mean, there were plenty of gems."
01:53:04;01:53:06;"Not really."
01:53:06;01:53:08;"I like the French Montana, I like the chic."
01:53:08;01:53:10;"The Bruno's good. The Bruno."
01:53:10;01:53:12;"Bruno's the highlight."
01:53:13;01:53:14;"Yeah, that might be one of the best songs."
01:53:14;01:53:16;"I think it's a toss-up, man."
01:53:16;01:53:18;"All right. It is what it is."
01:53:18;01:53:21;"All right, Jake, well, another great show in the can."
01:53:21;01:53:24;"I'm not gonna be here next show."
01:53:24;01:53:26;"Oh, yeah, that's crazy, man."
01:53:26;01:53:29;"The next show is apparently the 50th episode of ""Time Crisis."""
01:53:29;01:53:31;"Wow. Which is shocking."
01:53:31;01:53:33;"So I've probably been on, like, 45 of those."
01:53:33;01:53:36;"Time flies when you're doing a corporate food history"
01:53:36;01:53:39;"internet radio show every two weeks."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"[laughter]"
01:53:42;01:53:44;"You know why ""Time Crisis"" stays fresh?"
01:53:44;01:53:46;"'Cause we got that week off to rest."
01:53:46;01:53:48;"Yeah, man."
01:53:48;01:53:51;"Got one week off to just forget that ""Time Crisis"" exists"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"and then we come back fresh and rested."
01:53:53;01:53:55;"It's like, ""Oh, it's a 'Time Crisis' week."""
01:53:55;01:53:57;"Let's make it a ""Time Crisis"" week."
01:53:57;01:53:59;"My dad's turning 70."
01:53:59;01:54:01;"Yeah, so where are you gonna be?"
01:54:01;01:54:03;"In Vermont."
01:54:03;01:54:05;"Oh, really? You're going to Vermont?"
01:54:05;01:54:07;"Yeah."
01:54:07;01:54:09;"The land of fish and Ben and Jerry's?"
01:54:10;01:54:11;"You got some fish food over there?"
01:54:11;01:54:13;"Gonna be near Stowe, Vermont."
01:54:13;01:54:15;"Nice."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"It's a place we went a lot when we were growing up."
01:54:17;01:54:19;"That's nice. Yeah, that's a big birthday for your dad."
01:54:19;01:54:22;"Dad's 70th, so I will not be in town for the 50th."
01:54:22;01:54:25;"Well, you know what? It's okay that you're not--"
01:54:25;01:54:27;"""Time Crisis,"" we're not big on ceremony,"
01:54:27;01:54:29;"so you don't have to be there for the 50th."
01:54:29;01:54:32;"Also, 50 is so-- Joe Rogan's doing his 1,000th episode."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"Yeah."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"I saw that on Instagram today."
01:54:36;01:54:38;"He's doing his 1,000th episode soon."
01:54:39;01:54:40;"""TC made it to 50."""
01:54:40;01:54:42;"Here's what we're gonna do."
01:54:42;01:54:44;"Since we're gonna lose Jake, it's very sad."
01:54:44;01:54:46;"We're gonna fly Despot and Asher out."
01:54:46;01:54:48;"Big."
01:54:48;01:54:50;"'Cause I've been meaning to bring those guys out to the West Coast for a minute."
01:54:50;01:54:52;"I've never met Asher."
01:54:52;01:54:54;"You've never met Asher? Never met him."
01:54:54;01:54:56;"Wow, that's so crazy to me."
01:54:56;01:54:58;"Yeah."
01:54:58;01:55:00;"You just dropped a bomb on me."
01:55:00;01:55:02;"You've never met my cousin Asher?"
01:55:02;01:55:04;"Nope."
01:55:04;01:55:06;"And the twain shall never meet?"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"Maybe never meet."
01:55:08;01:55:10;"Maybe they don't know each other."
01:55:10;01:55:12;"Well, okay, I'm glad that we'll have those guys out."
01:55:12;01:55:14;"You know, an interesting thing about Asher, he went to college in L.A."
01:55:14;01:55:16;"Okay, I didn't know that."
01:55:16;01:55:18;"But he hasn't been back in this city in 11 years."
01:55:18;01:55:20;"What? Where did he go?"
01:55:20;01:55:22;"Occidental, in Eagle Rock."
01:55:22;01:55:24;"Oh, that's right where I live."
01:55:24;01:55:26;"Yeah, so he's coming-- we're bringing Asher back, first time in over a decade, to Los Angeles."
01:55:26;01:55:29;"And he left L.A., and was just like, ""I'm good. Not going back."""
01:55:29;01:55:31;"I guess."
01:55:31;01:55:33;"11 years?"
01:55:33;01:55:35;"Yeah, he hasn't been back to L.A. in 11 years, man."
01:55:35;01:55:37;"Did he like Occidental?"
01:55:37;01:55:39;"I thought I was missing this episode."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"All right, maybe you call in."
01:55:41;01:55:43;"I'd like to talk Eagle Rock, like 12 years ago."
01:55:43;01:55:45;"Or like whenever it was that he graduated college."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"You should call in from Vermont."
01:55:47;01:55:48;"Okay."
01:55:48;01:55:50;"How about that? Maybe see if you can track down Ben and Jerry."
01:55:50;01:55:51;"Can do."
01:55:51;01:55:53;"All right, thank you."
01:55:53;01:55:55;"All right, guys, we'll see you in two weeks."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"Jake will talk to you in two weeks."
01:55:57;01:55:59;"See you in four."
