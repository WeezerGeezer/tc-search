00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis back again. Guess what TC heads? I finally saw a Star is Born. I"
00:07;00:13;"stepped into the SCBoo and I left a piece of my heart there. On this week's"
00:13;00:19;"episode we get some great fan submissions. We read an email from Beto O'Rourke"
00:19;00:24;"that I thought was a personal one but went out to millions of people and we"
00:24;00:34;"also count on the top hits of today in 1991. This is Time Crisis with Eds M. Kaden."
00:34;00:35;"Peace."
00:35;00:37;"[MUSIC - ""THE GREAT ROMANCES""]"
00:37;00:44;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:44;00:51;"You were a friend to a belief, all my rightful chances."
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the boss had to go."
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:10;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:16;01:20;"Leave it on me, babe."
01:20;01:22;"All right, Time Crisis back once again."
01:22;01:26;"How are the Joker Man rehearsals going?"
01:26;01:28;"I was just telling Jake that we've"
01:28;01:31;"been working on a pretty good cover of Joker Man."
01:31;01:33;"Full version, all the verses?"
01:33;01:35;"Yeah, plus some of our own fun stuff."
01:35;01:38;"We did a version, I was just listening to it."
01:38;01:41;"We have one version of Joker Man that's 11 minutes."
01:41;01:42;"That's what I want to hear."
01:42;01:44;"I know, I know that's what you want."
01:44;01:46;"Does this include solos?"
01:46;01:50;"Yeah, although it's not too noodley, actually."
01:50;01:54;"Right, because the original was like, what, six or seven?"
01:54;01:56;"The original's already six, so you start adding in some"
01:56;01:57;"instrumental moments."
01:57;01:58;"It gets long."
01:58;02:00;"Are you transitioning into Joker Man,"
02:00;02:02;"or are you just starting it cold?"
02:02;02:02;"We started cold."
02:02;02:04;"It's Joker Man."
02:04;02:04;"Yeah."
02:04;02:05;"It's Joker Man."
02:05;02:08;"It's pretty faithful at first, and you'll see."
02:08;02:11;"Jake, I finally have joined you as somebody"
02:11;02:13;"who has seen A Star is Born."
02:13;02:14;"Congratulations."
02:14;02:16;"We've been talking a lot about this."
02:16;02:19;"A Star is Born, before the show, somebody"
02:19;02:21;"was saying A Star is Born may almost"
02:21;02:25;"be the new Ed Sheeran shape of you for the show."
02:25;02:27;"It's just inescapable, on the charts."
02:27;02:30;"And we'll be talking about it, one of the Oscars, February,"
02:30;02:31;"March, or whatever."
02:31;02:32;"Yeah, yeah."
02:32;02:34;"So we'll be talking about it between now"
02:34;02:36;"and that period, at least."
02:36;02:37;"Well--"
02:37;02:38;"Three, four months."
02:38;02:39;"--well into 2019."
02:39;02:41;"We just heard that Bradley Cooper"
02:41;02:43;"said he's got something special planned for the live"
02:43;02:45;"performance of Shallow."
02:45;02:46;"You know what I think it is?"
02:46;02:48;"He'll be hammered."
02:48;02:49;"I'm just going to get [BLEEP] faced."
02:49;02:52;"I think he's going to do an 11-minute Shallow."
02:52;02:55;"The Oscar's infamously strict, trying to get people off stage."
02:55;02:57;"The speech is running long."
02:57;02:59;"Bradley just rolls up with Bob Weir."
02:59;03:00;"You know what would be sick?"
03:00;03:02;"Launch into it."
03:02;03:03;"The network freaks out."
03:03;03:04;"They cut the ad."
03:04;03:04;"They come back."
03:04;03:06;"Still going."
03:06;03:09;"At that point, they transition into Jack Straw."
03:09;03:13;"Shallow, Arrow, Jack Straw."
03:13;03:17;"They recreate that early '70s 42-minute plane in the band"
03:17;03:18;"with Shallow just in the middle."
03:18;03:20;"[HUMMING]"
03:20;03:21;"It's my dream."
03:21;03:24;"I want you a special screening of A Star Is Born."
03:24;03:25;"OK."
03:25;03:27;"It's been out for months."
03:27;03:28;"I know."
03:28;03:30;"That's the hilarious part."
03:30;03:32;"Basically, friend of Time Crisis, Mark Ronson,"
03:32;03:35;"who's one of the writers of Shallow, hosted a screening."
03:35;03:36;"Oh, cool."
03:36;03:38;"And I was like, Ted, I haven't seen it yet."
03:38;03:39;"Most people had seen it."
03:39;03:39;"But whatever."
03:39;03:40;"It was cool to go see it."
03:40;03:44;"So the screening was sponsored by the studio, whoever made it."
03:44;03:47;"So when I walked in, there were some people"
03:47;03:50;"from the studio, from the film company."
03:50;03:54;"And before you sat down, they said, do you want a t-shirt?"
03:54;03:55;"And they had them all laid out."
03:55;03:57;"And we've talked about A Star Is Born"
03:57;03:59;"merch on this show before."
03:59;04:03;"Because if you go online, you can find very realistic A Star"
04:03;04:07;"Is Born merch that's like a real Jackson Maine, who's"
04:07;04:08;"the character, shirt."
04:08;04:09;"Or you can get an Ali shirt."
04:09;04:12;"Louisville, Kentucky show, 2009."
04:12;04:13;"Yeah, exactly."
04:13;04:16;"And there was an even deeper one that was like Maine Brothers,"
04:16;04:17;"'95."
04:17;04:20;"That's so obscure, even within the A Star Is Born"
04:20;04:21;"universe, a.k.a."
04:21;04:22;"the S.C. Boo."
04:22;04:23;"So I was kind of excited."
04:23;04:25;"Maybe this is going to be one of those Jackson Maine shirts"
04:25;04:26;"or an Ali shirt."
04:26;04:28;"And I could give it to Jake to wear in public."
04:28;04:32;"That would be the real test."
04:32;04:33;"A test of your fandom."
04:33;04:36;"But I could tell as I approached, it wasn't quite that."
04:36;04:39;"It's a black t-shirt, kind of over the left breast."
04:39;04:40;"It says A Star Is Born."
04:40;04:42;"And I'm like, all right, it's a little boring."
04:42;04:45;"And then I get closer, and they're all v-necks."
04:45;04:48;"Wow, it's rough stuff, folks."
04:48;04:51;"Which is so weird."
04:51;04:53;"Although I guess fitting for A Star Is Born,"
04:53;04:55;"because probably Bradley Cooper's character"
04:55;04:56;"is the type of dude who--"
04:56;04:57;"I don't know if he wears them in the movie,"
04:57;05:00;"but he's the type of guy who might wear a v-neck."
05:00;05:01;"I could see him pulling it off."
05:01;05:04;"Not that there's only one type of guy who wears a v-neck,"
05:04;05:06;"but he's a type of guy who'd wear a v-neck, which"
05:06;05:07;"is the kind of--"
05:07;05:09;"because there's the kind of like Jersey Shore v-neck,"
05:09;05:12;"and this is more like the rugged v-neck."
05:12;05:15;"Anyway, so now I have a A Star Is Born v-neck t-shirt."
05:15;05:17;"Will you wear it publicly?"
05:17;05:18;"Maybe."
05:18;05:19;"What context?"
05:19;05:21;"I don't wear v-necks that often."
05:21;05:23;"And we were talking a little bit before the show"
05:23;05:25;"just about v-necks, period."
05:25;05:28;"I think v-necks have gotten a bad reputation"
05:28;05:30;"over the past 10 years."
05:30;05:32;"Whereas I think back in the day, a v-neck"
05:32;05:37;"was the kind of shirt that a chilled out dude would wear."
05:37;05:38;"Am I wrong here?"
05:38;05:39;"I don't know."
05:39;05:41;"What's the origin of the v-neck?"
05:41;05:43;"Is it something you'd wear under a button-down shirt"
05:43;05:44;"so you don't get the--"
05:44;05:47;"you know if you wear a t-shirt and you have a button-down"
05:47;05:48;"shirt, and then if you--"
05:48;05:50;"but if you don't button it all the way to the top,"
05:50;05:52;"you'd see the t-shirt underneath?"
05:52;05:57;"I've always found that a t-shirt under a unbuttoned--"
05:57;05:58;"Dress shirt."
05:58;05:59;"Dress shirt is such a dorky look."
05:59;06:00;"It's a terrible look."
06:00;06:02;"That was one of my main things in early Vampire Weekend,"
06:02;06:05;"because we always wore dress shirts, button downs."
06:05;06:07;"I'd always be like, well, can't wear t-shirts."
06:07;06:08;"I put my foot down about that."
06:08;06:11;"But I kind of feel like a chilled out dude would have"
06:11;06:13;"worn just like a white v-- because if back in the day"
06:13;06:15;"it was considered like an undershirt,"
06:15;06:16;"and you're just like a chilled out dude,"
06:16;06:18;"you threw that on in a pair of jeans--"
06:18;06:19;"I'm talking like '70s--"
06:19;06:21;"somebody would probably look at you and be like,"
06:21;06:23;"that's a chilled out dude."
06:23;06:24;"He's not trying too hard."
06:24;06:25;"Whereas at some point it flipped,"
06:25;06:27;"and a v-neck became the opposite."
06:27;06:28;"It became trying too hard."
06:28;06:29;"It's a statement."
06:29;06:33;"And then also people found the concept of the deep v"
06:33;06:35;"especially humorous."
06:35;06:38;"Do you remember everybody thought deep v's were so funny?"
06:38;06:38;"I don't."
06:38;06:39;"I missed this."
06:39;06:40;"Maybe just in my circle."
06:40;06:41;"Yeah."
06:41;06:41;"I feel like--"
06:41;06:42;"I don't know."
06:42;06:44;"There might have been some sketch or some comedian--"
06:44;06:45;"There was a sketch."
06:45;06:46;"There was an SNL."
06:46;06:48;"It was Ben Stiller doing them."
06:48;06:50;"There was a double v. There was a v that went down"
06:50;06:51;"to the belly button."
06:51;06:52;"And they would just keep getting deeper and deeper."
06:52;06:53;"That's right."
06:53;06:56;"And the implication was the deeper the v,"
06:56;06:58;"the more of a douchebag a guy was?"
06:58;06:59;"Sure, yeah."
06:59;07:08;"When I was still growing up, and dad had off to work,"
07:08;07:14;"he put a coat and tie on, overfitted shirt."
07:17;07:23;"Nothing else would fit right or seem so directly applied."
07:23;07:35;"A fitted shirt hung on me, fitted shirt all right."
07:35;07:44;"I long for the days they used to say, ma'am and yes sir."
07:44;07:52;"Now I'm going to find buttons for my dad's old yellow shirt."
07:52;07:56;"Fitted shirt."
07:56;08:01;"Fitted shirt."
08:01;08:05;"So what's going to happen with the Star is Born black v?"
08:05;08:06;"Well, I could--"
08:06;08:07;"Bottom of the t-shirt drawer."
08:07;08:10;"I could wear it to exercise."
08:10;08:12;"I could wear it to sleep."
08:12;08:13;"You change t's for sleeping?"
08:13;08:16;"Not usually, only if it's like very cold."
08:16;08:19;"Usually shirtless or just the shirt you're wearing that day?"
08:19;08:20;"Usually shirtless."
08:20;08:21;"I get kind of overheated."
08:21;08:22;"What about you?"
08:22;08:24;"You wear the one that you've been wearing all day?"
08:24;08:25;"Usually."
08:25;08:27;"I have a feeling that people are probably listening,"
08:27;08:29;"saying these guys are a couple of dirtbags."
08:29;08:31;"2/3 of the time, I'm just going to bed"
08:31;08:33;"with the shirt I wore that day."
08:33;08:34;"Because I'm a morning shower guy."
08:34;08:35;"Oh, yeah."
08:35;08:37;"As am I. But I still think people are probably"
08:37;08:39;"listening think that we're a couple of dirtbags,"
08:39;08:42;"a couple of deep v dirtbags."
08:42;08:43;"Is this what normal people do?"
08:43;08:45;"They wear a t-shirt all day."
08:45;08:47;"They didn't particularly break a sweat because they"
08:47;08:49;"work in data management."
08:49;08:52;"And they come home, watch some TV, eat dinner."
08:52;08:53;"Shirt's still on."
08:53;08:54;"Shirt's still on."
08:54;08:58;"Then it's like time for bed, take off their jeans,"
08:58;09:00;"and then take off the t-shirt too,"
09:00;09:02;"and go into another drawer and say,"
09:02;09:05;"like, mm, what would be a good PJ shirt to wear?"
09:05;09:05;"I do that."
09:05;09:06;"That's what you do, Seinfeld?"
09:06;09:07;"That's my routine."
09:07;09:08;"Is that a Canadian thing?"
09:08;09:11;"Or that's just what normal people across--"
09:11;09:13;"I don't know about normal, but I--"
09:13;09:15;"So what happens with that t-shirt in the next morning?"
09:15;09:16;"The pajama t-shirt?"
09:16;09:17;"Yeah."
09:17;09:19;"Is that tomorrow night's pajama t-shirt?"
09:19;09:20;"Or is that just a one-off?"
09:20;09:21;"That's a night shirt."
09:21;09:24;"And then I'm showering, and I'm going into another shirt."
09:24;09:25;"So it's going in the hamper."
09:25;09:27;"Going in the hamper."
09:27;09:28;"Every day you wear two t-shirts."
09:28;09:29;"Yes."
09:29;09:30;"Sometimes three."
09:30;09:33;"So you're doing 14 to 21 t-shirts a week?"
09:33;09:34;"Yeah, I suppose."
09:34;09:36;"Well, I mean, I guess I'm washing--"
09:36;09:38;"probably some of those shirts are in the cycle."
09:38;09:40;"So you'll just sleep in a shirt from, like--"
09:40;09:41;"That's all."
09:41;09:43;"--11 PM to, like, 7 AM."
09:43;09:44;"Yeah."
09:44;09:46;"And the AC is on in your place."
09:46;09:48;"It's a very completely reasonable temperature."
09:48;09:49;"Yeah, you know what?"
09:49;09:49;"And even with the AC--"
09:49;09:51;"And you're not breaking a sweat."
09:51;09:52;"I'm still sweating."
09:52;09:55;"Even with the AC on, I'm still kind of sweating overnight."
09:55;09:56;"But don't you ever be like, you know what?"
09:56;09:57;"I'm just going to set--"
09:57;09:59;"I'm going to take the t-shirt off at 7 AM."
09:59;10:00;"The alarm goes off."
10:00;10:02;"I'm going to fold the t-shirt, set it on the bed."
10:02;10:04;"I'm going to wear it tomorrow night."
10:04;10:05;"No, because that t-shirt's been sweated in."
10:05;10:07;"But just put it on tomorrow night."
10:07;10:09;"But then it's, like, salty."
10:09;10:11;"Are there very clear-cut boundaries--"
10:11;10:12;"This is insane."
10:12;10:14;"--about your day versus night t-shirts?"
10:14;10:16;"Yeah, because the night t-shirts are, like,"
10:16;10:19;"what you've just described, like, old, you know--"
10:19;10:20;"Amen to Cape Cod."
10:20;10:21;"They've got holes in them."
10:21;10:22;"[LAUGHTER]"
10:22;10:23;"All the TC merch."
10:23;10:25;"That's why we've been making the merch."
10:25;10:27;"No, they're just old, like, you know,"
10:27;10:30;"sloppy shirts that are from, like, 15 years ago"
10:30;10:31;"that I used to wear during the day"
10:31;10:34;"and have now been demoted to the night."
10:34;10:35;"Wow."
10:35;10:35;"Yeah, like--"
10:35;10:37;"And that AC boot shirt, that would"
10:37;10:39;"have been, like, a good candidate for, like, a night"
10:39;10:39;"shirt."
10:39;10:41;"Straight to the night shirt."
10:41;10:42;"Not even consideration for the day."
10:42;10:45;"Well, I think that, Ezra, what you might want to do"
10:45;10:48;"is do a little modification and make it a scoop-nack."
10:48;10:51;"Get some scissors, convert that V to a scoop."
10:51;10:54;"Now you've got, like, a cool DIY kind of raggedy--"
10:54;10:57;"You know, I think maybe I should just start wearing it."
10:57;10:59;"You know, they say you got to, like, be the change you"
10:59;11:01;"want to see in the world."
11:01;11:06;"I wish I was the type of chilled-out dude who would go--"
11:06;11:07;"[LAUGHTER]"
11:07;11:11;"Go to a screening of ""A Star is Born,"""
11:11;11:14;"get a free V-neck shirt, and then just, like,"
11:14;11:16;"wear it to a party that week."
11:16;11:17;"Just rock it."
11:17;11:20;"And somebody would be like, whoa, ""A Star is Born,"""
11:20;11:21;"V-neck, did you buy that?"
11:21;11:23;"And be like, no, I went to a screening."
11:23;11:24;"They were giving them away."
11:24;11:26;"Well, are you, like, really into the movie?"
11:26;11:27;"It was good."
11:27;11:28;"I mean, they were giving them away."
11:28;11:30;"Do you think that's a cool shirt?"
11:30;11:31;"I didn't really think about it."
11:31;11:33;"It's a free shirt."
11:33;11:34;"Yeah, it's a free shirt."
11:34;11:36;"Are you being ironic?"
11:36;11:37;"I just told you, I saw the movie."
11:37;11:38;"I liked it."
11:38;11:39;"And they gave the shirt away."
11:39;11:41;"I didn't buy it, but, you know, whatever."
11:41;11:42;"It's a shirt."
11:42;11:43;"I wish I was that chilled-out."
11:43;11:45;"That is inspiring, actually."
11:45;11:46;"Yeah, just picture that dude."
11:46;11:48;"And they're just like, no, bro, like, sit down."
11:48;11:51;"You're making fun of ""A Star is Born"" right now?"
11:51;11:51;"It's a good movie."
11:51;11:53;"I mean, it's probably going to win some Oscars."
11:53;11:54;"What are you talking about?"
11:54;11:56;"That would be a fun shirt to wear at an Oscar party,"
11:56;11:56;"though, or something."
11:56;11:59;"Or if you're chilling at home, maybe watching the Oscars,"
11:59;12:00;"you wear that shirt."
12:00;12:03;"You feel like you're kind of connected to the film."
12:03;12:04;"That's true."
12:04;12:05;"Wear it to the Oscars."
12:05;12:06;"Ooh."
12:06;12:07;"I think--"
12:07;12:09;"You have to wear a tuxedo to the Oscars."
12:09;12:11;"I want to borrow a shirt from you."
12:11;12:12;"Yeah."
12:12;12:16;"And I want to wear it for a few days, just in my daily routine."
12:16;12:16;"It could be like--"
12:16;12:17;"I'll report back."
12:17;12:18;"I want to see how it feels."
12:18;12:20;"Do you remember there was a--"
12:20;12:22;"they always do these kind of like undercover videos."
12:22;12:24;"Like, there was one about catcalling"
12:24;12:27;"to show non-women what it's like for a woman walking"
12:27;12:29;"the streets in New York City getting catcalled all day."
12:29;12:31;"We could do one where, like, Seinfeld follows you"
12:31;12:34;"with, like, a secret camera, just like Jake walking"
12:34;12:38;"down the streets of Los Angeles wearing a ""Stars Born"" shirt,"
12:38;12:40;"just to see what happens."
12:40;12:41;"Real slice of life."
12:41;12:42;"[MUSIC - ""STARS BORN""]"
12:42;12:49;"I like the way your sparkling earrings lay"
12:49;12:52;"against your skin so brown."
12:52;13:02;"And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight"
13:02;13:07;"with a billion stars all around."
13:07;13:15;"Because I got a peaceful, easy feeling"
13:15;13:21;"that I know you won't let me down."
13:21;13:31;"Because I'm already standing on the ground."
13:31;13:35;"I've definitely rocked pretty innocuous free t-shirts"
13:35;13:36;"in my life."
13:36;13:38;"Oh, yeah, right now Jake is wearing a--"
13:38;13:38;"A black polar fleece."
13:38;13:40;"--a Pagdonia polar fleece, but it's"
13:40;13:44;"branded on the side as a Showtime documentary films."
13:44;13:46;"I have no idea what this is from."
13:46;13:47;"Oh, you weren't at an event?"
13:47;13:47;"This just showed up."
13:47;13:48;"No."
13:48;13:50;"I mean, I think maybe Hannah got this at Sundance one year."
13:50;13:51;"Yeah."
13:51;13:52;"And this was just in our house."
13:52;13:55;"And then it was in my studio, and it got cold today."
13:55;13:56;"And I was just like, I was digging around"
13:56;13:59;"in this pile of clothes in the corner of the studio,"
13:59;14:00;"and I found it, and I put it on."
14:00;14:02;"No idea what the back story is."
14:02;14:04;"But this is innocuous enough that I would just"
14:04;14:06;"wear this in public and feel free about it."
14:06;14:07;"Yeah, it's chill."
14:07;14:11;"A V-neck black Star is Born t-shirt"
14:11;14:13;"is really like throwing a flag out."
14:13;14:16;"I guess I found it so unusual that they were giving away"
14:16;14:20;"V-necks because it's not exactly considered a neutral shirt."
14:20;14:21;"Right."
14:21;14:21;"You know what I mean?"
14:21;14:25;"I think if somebody saw just like a regular black t-shirt"
14:25;14:27;"that said a Star is Born, especially in LA,"
14:27;14:29;"they might look at you and be like, OK,"
14:29;14:30;"maybe this guy's a grip."
14:30;14:33;"He was a grip on a Star is Born."
14:33;14:34;"I want to try this."
14:34;14:36;"Maybe this guy was a caterer."
14:36;14:37;"He was a caterer."
14:37;14:38;"He was in the room with Gaga."
14:38;14:39;"He was one of the 99."
14:39;14:40;"Yeah."
14:40;14:41;"Oh, right."
14:41;14:44;"He was one of the gaffers who didn't believe in her."
14:44;14:45;"But he did believe in her."
14:45;14:48;"He felt bad that she said that."
14:48;14:48;"Right."
14:48;14:50;"He didn't want to overstep and tell her"
14:50;14:53;"that he did believe in her."
14:53;14:57;"I was wearing my Father's Day weekend shirt today."
14:57;14:59;"Oh, yeah, I can see it kind of under the fleece."
14:59;15:03;"It's a Vampire Weekend long sleeve, white long sleeve"
15:03;15:05;"tee from the Ohi shows this summer."
15:05;15:06;"Which is a coveted shirt now."
15:06;15:08;"Yeah, it's a great shirt."
15:08;15:10;"And when I wear it out, it gets a lot of eyeballs."
15:10;15:13;"And I actually got two different comments today about it."
15:13;15:14;"And do people know what it is?"
15:14;15:16;"Because it doesn't say Vampire Weekend on it."
15:16;15:18;"Or it says Vampire Weekend on the back."
15:18;15:19;"I have two stories just from today."
15:19;15:20;"Whoa."
15:20;15:23;"The first story was I went into the gym about 8 AM"
15:23;15:24;"wearing that."
15:24;15:27;"And one of the trainers that works there was like,"
15:27;15:27;"what is that?"
15:27;15:28;"Father's Day weekend?"
15:28;15:31;"I was like, oh, it's just this weird concert shirt."
15:31;15:32;"He's like, are you a father?"
15:32;15:34;"I was like, no, that is weird."
15:34;15:38;"End of that conversation."
15:38;15:40;"And then a few hours later, I was"
15:40;15:44;"dipping into the local coffee shop waiting on the iced coffee."
15:44;15:46;"And the guy behind the counter was like, hey,"
15:46;15:50;"did you see Ezra's going to be at the GQ Festival?"
15:50;15:51;"Talking about LP4."
15:51;15:52;"Oh, really?"
15:52;15:54;"I was like, no, what's that?"
15:54;15:55;"Is that here?"
15:55;15:55;"What is that?"
15:55;15:56;"I mean, I know what GQ is."
15:56;15:57;"What's--"
15:57;15:58;"The GQ Festival."
15:58;16:00;"He's like-- so he saw the shirt."
16:00;16:01;"Oh, that's tight."
16:01;16:02;"I don't think he even saw the back."
16:02;16:03;"He just saw the Father's Day weekend."
16:03;16:05;"I mean, he's pretty dialed in if he"
16:05;16:07;"knows that I'm going to be at the GQ thing."
16:07;16:09;"So he probably recognized the shirt, I would guess."
16:09;16:10;"Yeah."
16:10;16:11;"Yeah, I got like a DM or something from somebody"
16:11;16:14;"who was like, that O'Hei's show, which"
16:14;16:17;"was with Richard Pictures, that produced a few classic shirts."
16:17;16:19;"Your guy's shirt, the one that Kyle Field made,"
16:19;16:22;"the bringing out your dead one, this one."
16:22;16:24;"Yeah, I got a DM or somebody who was like--"
16:24;16:25;"Maybe they're at Cape Cod."
16:25;16:28;"--who was like, I'd really love to--"
16:28;16:31;"it's like, it's a grail shirt, as they say."
16:31;16:32;"Grail?"
16:32;16:35;"That's what like kind of streetwear collector types"
16:35;16:39;"would be like, some really coveted, rare item."
16:39;16:40;"I knew it when I saw it."
16:40;16:42;"I was like, that is a solid shirt."
16:42;16:44;"I remember that Sunday morning--"
16:44;16:45;"It's also tight because we can't just keep selling it."
16:45;16:47;"It's only for Father's Day weekend."
16:47;16:49;"It's a specific show shirt."
16:49;16:51;"I remember when I saw them, I was like, I need to get one."
16:51;16:53;"And then Sunday morning of that weekend,"
16:53;16:56;"I remember making a point of finding the merch person"
16:56;16:57;"and grabbing one."
16:57;16:57;"Yeah."
16:57;16:59;"And then by the end of the show, gone."
16:59;17:04;"Yeah, we killed it with the merch at the O'Hai shows."
17:04;17:07;"I was wearing that 8 Minute Cape Cod tie-dye shirt"
17:07;17:11;"in Hawaii this summer, and someone like ran across a field,"
17:11;17:13;"like spotted it from a distance."
17:13;17:14;"It was like, vampire weekend."
17:14;17:15;"Like, damn."
17:15;17:15;"TC?"
17:15;17:16;"I love the--"
17:16;17:16;"Yeah."
17:16;17:17;"I love the--"
17:17;17:18;"Were they adapted on TC?"
17:18;17:19;"I didn't ask."
17:19;17:20;"I think probably--"
17:20;17:21;"Because that's a TC thing."
17:21;17:21;"Yeah."
17:21;17:25;"You guys are listening to T-Shirt Talk, a new podcast--"
17:25;17:25;"Merch Talk."
17:25;17:30;"--from the Time Crisis family of podcasts,"
17:30;17:33;"brought to you by Sweet Martha's cookie jar."
17:33;17:36;"We have to start like--"
17:36;17:40;"First 40 minutes of the show, he's just talking about merch."
17:40;17:42;"We've got to start--"
17:42;17:45;"Just a shameless plug."
17:45;17:47;"It's the TCU."
17:47;17:48;"You know, it's like Pod Save America."
17:48;17:51;"Everybody has like a podcast network now."
17:51;17:51;"Yeah."
17:51;17:52;"Time Crisis has a start--"
17:52;17:53;"Crooked Media."
17:53;17:54;"Crooked Media."
17:54;17:56;"We've got to start branching out."
17:56;17:58;"Time Crisis Media, and we're doing--"
17:58;18:00;"Yeah, what's our media company name?"
18:00;18:00;"Because here's the thing--"
18:00;18:02;"Just TCU Media?"
18:02;18:03;"Maybe just TCU."
18:03;18:06;"Because we're giving the fans too much good content"
18:06;18:07;"under one umbrella."
18:07;18:10;"We've got to start diluting this [BLEEP].."
18:10;18:14;"If you're into T-shirts, you've got to start paying the T-Shirt"
18:14;18:15;"Talk Patreon."
18:15;18:17;"If you want to hear about Tasteful Palate, well, guess what?"
18:17;18:19;"We're not talking about on Time Crisis anymore."
18:19;18:20;"That's a separate pod."
18:20;18:24;"You've got to sign up for the Tasteful Palate pod."
18:24;18:24;"The TPP."
18:24;18:28;"That is a minimum $5 a month for each pod."
18:28;18:31;"Now, you're guaranteed at least 120 minutes"
18:31;18:32;"of content per month."
18:32;18:33;"That's right."
18:33;18:36;"Ooh, what about like a Jake, like a Bob Ross style,"
18:36;18:38;"where you're narrating your painting?"
18:38;18:40;"But it's a podcast, and you can't see it?"
18:40;18:41;"Yeah, but it's a podcast."
18:41;18:42;"Oh, that's a good idea."
18:42;18:44;"That's a good idea."
18:44;18:47;"So I'm mixing the titanium white."
18:47;18:49;"Now, that is a Gamblin Fast Matte White."
18:49;18:51;"Now, I'm going to dilute that."
18:51;18:53;"I'm going to-- what I'm going to do"
18:53;18:56;"is put it down about four ounces of the titanium white,"
18:56;18:59;"and then maybe a half ounce of the Gamsol solvent."
18:59;19:01;"Now, I'm going to take the palette knife and just mix that."
19:01;19:02;"And you see that."
19:02;19:03;"No, but you know what else--"
19:03;19:04;"A little hunk of pot."
19:04;19:07;"Jake always listens to podcasts while he's painting."
19:07;19:10;"So just another podcast blaring in the background."
19:10;19:13;"Like, you go quiet for a second, and you just"
19:13;19:15;"hear like, Chavo Trap House blaring."
19:15;19:16;"Oh my god."
19:16;19:19;"And you're just kind of murmuring to yourself, like, hmm."
19:19;19:19;"All right."
19:19;19:22;"New episode of the Brett Easton Ellis podcast dropped today."
19:22;19:25;"We're going to be playing that in the background."
19:25;19:26;"Mark Maron asked a hard-hitting question."
19:26;19:29;"Like, that's a pretty good one, Mark."
19:29;19:31;"Bro, save politics, dude."
19:31;19:33;"We've always talked about doing time crisis live events,"
19:33;19:35;"and we probably will at some point."
19:35;19:36;"Great."
19:36;19:37;"We definitely should."
19:37;19:40;"And we've got to do special merch for those."
19:40;19:43;"We've got to make some kind of TC merch"
19:43;19:45;"that I think that's a Jake shirt if you're down for it."
19:45;19:46;"I just want to see--"
19:46;19:50;"it literally could just be like a screenshot of your Wikipedia."
19:50;19:53;"I just want a piece of merch that says American painter"
19:53;19:54;"and radio personality."
19:54;19:55;"Yeah, that's good."
19:55;19:56;"Or Jake Longsworth is an American painter"
19:56;19:58;"and radio personality."
19:58;20:00;"Like a photo, like a cool photo of me or something?"
20:00;20:01;"Mm-hmm."
20:01;20:04;"And then on the back, it says American painter"
20:04;20:06;"and radio personality."
20:06;20:08;"A photo of you wearing the eight-minute Cape Cod"
20:08;20:09;"new black long sleeve."
20:09;20:10;"Yes."
20:10;20:13;"And then the back, American painter and radio personality."
20:13;20:13;"That's a strong shirt."

20:15;20:19;"(SINGING) Randolph Painter died last night."

20:33;20:39;"Drink to me."
20:39;20:42;"Drink to my health."
20:42;20:45;"You know I can't drink anymore."
20:49;20:51;"Drink to me."

20:53;20:56;"You know I can't drink anymore."
20:56;21:06;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats 1."
21:06;21:08;"By the way, Seinfeld, since we're doing a t-shirt talk"
21:08;21:11;"episode today, you did kind of like a contest"
21:11;21:14;"on Twitter for the black eight-minute Cape Cod long"
21:14;21:14;"sleeves."
21:14;21:15;"I did, yeah."
21:15;21:19;"And I'll tweet the winners as I speak right now."
21:19;21:19;"OK."
21:19;21:21;"So while you're listening, you're going to see who won."
21:21;21:23;"Because I was dipping in to check,"
21:23;21:25;"and I noticed that contests seem to have"
21:25;21:29;"like a very nice organic growth, where people went from just"
21:29;21:31;"tweeting a sentence or two at you"
21:31;21:35;"to writing like poetry and things of that nature."
21:35;21:37;"Yeah, they really brought the Notes app out."
21:37;21:42;"People were doing collages of all the TCU stuff."
21:42;21:44;"A lot of really good stuff in there."
21:44;21:47;"Someone did a Steve Miller tribute song, Patrick."
21:47;21:49;"Patrick who did the--"
21:49;21:50;"We have to get to that."
21:50;21:51;"We should get into that."
21:51;21:52;"Very creative Crisis crew."
21:52;21:54;"Should we just get into that Patrick crow"
21:54;21:55;"fast while we're just thinking of it?"
21:55;21:57;"Otherwise, we might forget."
21:57;21:58;"So Patrick--"
21:58;21:59;"Patrick World."
21:59;22:04;"And this is the same Patrick who made that Machine Gun Kelly"
22:04;22:05;"style diss track."
22:05;22:06;"That's right."
22:06;22:06;"Towards me."
22:06;22:08;"Patrick World from Montreal."
22:08;22:09;"Oh, really?"
22:09;22:10;"Oh, that's cool."
22:10;22:12;"So Patrick World made a new song."
22:12;22:14;"And this one is aimed at Steve Miller."
22:14;22:16;"And I'd like to point out, we're talking about the musician."
22:16;22:18;"There's a few people named Steve Miller."
22:18;22:21;"We're talking about the musician who had the Steve Miller band."
22:21;22:22;"Enemy of the show."
22:22;22:25;"As all TC heads will recall, but maybe some people"
22:25;22:27;"who are new to the show are working backwards,"
22:27;22:29;"we've taken quite an issue with Mr. Miller"
22:29;22:33;"after we uncovered that despite having played"
22:33;22:36;"with the Grateful Dead off and on over the decades,"
22:36;22:39;"from the '60s all the way through the '90s,"
22:39;22:43;"as recent as '92, or was it '91, opening for them?"
22:43;22:44;"'92."
22:44;22:45;"'92."
22:45;22:46;"And even sitting in with them."
22:46;22:49;"After Jerry Garcia died, Steve Miller"
22:49;22:51;"started running his mouth."
22:51;22:53;"So anyway, we were very offended by that."
22:53;22:54;"And I guess so was Patrick World,"
22:54;22:56;"because he's made a song, which we're"
22:56;22:59;"listening to the first time, just like you are."
22:59;23:00;"Hopefully it's appropriate."
23:00;23:01;"It's called ""He Dissed the Dead."""

23:31;23:32;"He is a loser."

24:18;24:20;"We've been going hard in the paint on Steve Miller."
24:20;24:23;"But I just want to give him a little bit of love,"
24:23;24:24;"because this song--"
24:24;24:24;"Everybody's--"
24:24;24:25;"And I guess--"
24:25;24:26;"Let's listen to this for a sec."
24:26;24:26;"Because this--"
24:26;24:27;"We did find out that Jerry talked"
24:27;24:29;"to [BLEEP] about the doors."
24:29;24:30;"About the doors."
24:30;24:31;"This song is dope."
24:34;24:38;"[MUSIC - THE BEATLES, ""SERENADE""]"
25:13;25:16;"Are those two voices at an octave, or is that a harmony?"
25:16;25:18;"I think it's just an octave."
25:18;25:21;"[MUSIC - THE BEATLES, ""SERENADE""]"
25:39;25:42;"[MUSIC - THE BEATLES, ""SERENADE""]"
25:42;25:45;"[MUSIC - THE BEATLES, ""SERENADE""]"
25:45;25:46;"That's a harmony."
25:46;25:48;"Yeah, that's a harmony."
25:48;25:51;"[MUSIC - THE BEATLES, ""SERENADE""]"
25:51;25:55;"[MUSIC - THE BEATLES, ""SERENADE""]"
25:55;25:57;"All right, it's a pretty good song."
25:57;25:59;"We never said that Steve Miller's music was trash."
25:59;26:00;"No, I know."
26:00;26:04;"We gave him mad love, too, when we listened to ""Joker."""
26:04;26:08;"Yeah, ""Joker"" is a great song, although it's no ""Joker"" man."
26:08;26:12;"Well, that goes without saying."
26:12;26:13;"You, sir, know Bob Dylan."
26:13;26:16;"That'd be cool if at some kind of classic rock event,"
26:16;26:20;"like Steve Miller went up to Dylan, must be a fan of his,"
26:20;26:23;"and just like, hey, man, really just want to say"
26:23;26:25;"what a fan of yours I am."
26:25;26:28;"And Bob says, [BLEEP] you, you dissed Jerry."
26:28;26:29;"Turns his back."
26:29;26:30;"Jerry's my boy."
26:30;26:31;"Bob never dissed Jerry."
26:31;26:33;"They toured together, too."
26:33;26:34;"'87, dude, ""Dylan and the Dead."""
26:34;26:35;"Yep."
26:35;26:37;"Are you in on ""Dylan and the Dead?"""
26:37;26:39;"I've tried to listen to that live record."
26:39;26:40;"I'm in."
26:40;26:43;"I mean, it's definitely like a low point in both their careers."
26:43;26:45;"It doesn't sound great."
26:45;26:48;"Although ""Dylan and the Dead,"" it's a gold album, as I recall,"
26:48;26:50;"from looking at the discography."
26:50;26:53;"Two icons teaming up like that, I mean, it's going to sell,"
26:53;26:56;"for sure."
26:56;26:57;"Sounds good to me, man."
26:57;26:59;"Yeah, actually, this does sound pretty good."
26:59;27:01;"[MUSIC - BOB DYLAN, ""DYLAN AND THE DEAD""]"
27:08;27:10;"Gypsy, take a side."
27:10;27:13;"Alone, so long, and ride the rise."
27:13;27:17;"Silver saxophones say I should refuse you."
27:17;27:20;"The crack of this, and what's that haunt?"
27:20;27:22;"Burnt to my face with--"
27:22;27:23;"It's crazy."
27:23;27:26;"This is 31 years ago."
27:26;27:26;"Yeah."
27:26;27:31;"And Bob Dylan already sounds like completely spent."
27:31;27:34;"This is right around the time he launched the NeverEnding Tour."
27:34;27:35;"Right."
27:35;27:38;"[MUSIC - BOB DYLAN, ""DYLAN AND THE DEAD""]"
27:38;27:56;"It's not even that his voice sounds that crazy."
27:56;27:57;"His delivery's booming."
27:57;27:59;"Dylan's driving."
27:59;28:00;"Yeah, it's just like--"
28:00;28:03;"[MUSIC - BOB DYLAN, ""DYLAN AND THE DEAD""]"
28:04;28:06;"OK, I'm not mad at it."
28:06;28:09;"You got to serve somebody."
28:09;28:11;"Slow train coming, album."
28:11;28:15;"[MUSIC - BOB DYLAN, ""DYLAN AND THE DEAD""]"
28:15;28:17;"I mean, Jerry sounds great."
28:17;28:18;"Jerry and Bob, guitars."

28:22;28:25;"[MUSIC - BOB DYLAN, ""DYLAN AND THE DEAD""]"
28:25;28:42;"Bob's really on his mumble rap in this era."
28:42;28:44;"Mumblecore, dude."
28:44;28:45;"Forget about the Duplass Brothers."
28:45;28:48;"This is the original mumblecore, dude."
28:48;28:51;"[MUSIC - BOB DYLAN, ""DYLAN AND THE DEAD""]"
28:51;29:11;"It could have gone into a sped up West LA fadeaway."
29:11;29:12;"Oh, totally."
29:12;29:15;"[MUSIC - BOB DYLAN, ""DYLAN AND THE DEAD""]"
29:15;29:18;"[MUSIC - BOB DYLAN, ""DYLAN AND THE DEAD""]"
29:18;29:21;"All right, Dylan, the decent."
29:21;29:23;"Got some good emails lately."
29:23;29:24;"Decent."
29:24;29:25;"Solid."
29:25;29:26;"Oh, yeah, the elections happened."
29:26;29:28;"Yeah, I mean, elections were decent."
29:28;29:29;"Yeah, for sure."
29:29;29:31;"Here's a good email we got."
29:31;29:33;"We were talking the other day about how"
29:33;29:37;"TC Heads has really seemed to stick for fans of Time Crisis,"
29:37;29:40;"but there's never really been a good name for fans"
29:40;29:41;"of Vampire Weekend."
29:41;29:42;"Yeah."
29:42;29:45;"And as also we found out over the past couple weeks,"
29:45;29:49;"not every TC Head is a Vampire Weekend head, and vice versa."
29:49;29:52;"We've gotten a solid amount of emails that are just like,"
29:52;29:55;"I do not like that band."
29:55;30:00;"We specifically asked on the last show,"
30:00;30:05;"is there anybody who's a true TC Head who just"
30:05;30:07;"does not like Vampire Weekend?"
30:07;30:10;"To be fair, nobody said they hated Vampire Weekend."
30:10;30:11;"That would have been a shocker."
30:11;30:13;"But there are plenty of people who are like,"
30:13;30:14;"not a fan of the band."
30:14;30:16;"It's just not my thing."
30:16;30:18;"Although they're probably being extra polite because they're"
30:18;30:19;"TC Heads."
30:19;30:21;"And Jake, your painting, real boring."
30:21;30:23;"[LAUGHS]"
30:23;30:25;"Like whatever you guys do outside of the show,"
30:25;30:26;"not into it."
30:26;30:27;"Bullshit."
30:27;30:29;"Hate Neo-Yokio."
30:29;30:30;"I hate it all."
30:30;30:34;"Well, I guess the thing is that, to be fair,"
30:34;30:36;"the paintings Vampire Weekend, Neo-Yokio,"
30:36;30:39;"they don't really stand a chance against Time Crisis"
30:39;30:42;"because internet radio is the ultimate art form."
30:42;30:44;"What we provide on this show--"
30:44;30:45;"It's ethical content."
30:45;30:46;"--is ethical content."
30:46;30:49;"[LAUGHS]"
30:49;30:51;"Through a major corporation."
30:51;30:53;"Ethical content through a major corporation"
30:53;30:56;"that, when you listen to Time Crisis,"
30:56;31:01;"you're stepping into two to three minds at any given time."
31:01;31:04;"You're directly teleporting into a situation."
31:04;31:07;"It's what the other art forms aspire to."
31:07;31:08;"It's like the dead, man."
31:08;31:13;"But even the dead, known for improvisation, new ideas,"
31:13;31:17;"hairpin turns, unexpected musical moments,"
31:17;31:19;"even they, like any musicians, would not"
31:19;31:22;"have the agility of internet radio hosts."
31:22;31:25;"Somebody actually stopped me on the street recently."
31:25;31:29;"A guy yelled my name, and I kind of looked over as he drove by."
31:29;31:31;"And then he backed up down the block just to be like,"
31:31;31:33;"yo, man, big fan."
31:33;31:34;"Love Time Crisis."
31:34;31:38;"Maybe because TC is a slightly more tucked away thing,"
31:38;31:40;"it almost makes me feel a little better."
31:40;31:42;"I've met many Vampire Weekend fans over the years."
31:42;31:45;"A true TC head is a little more rare."
31:45;31:47;"But actually, somebody-- was this in the email,"
31:47;31:49;"or was this on Twitter or something?"
31:49;31:52;"Somebody made a Venn diagram of the differences"
31:52;31:55;"between Vampire Weekend fans and TC heads."
31:55;31:57;"Seinfeld, we get a number crunch on that?"
31:57;32:00;"I like how this episode is fully self-referential."
32:00;32:01;"Oh, yeah."
32:01;32:02;"Talking about our own merch."
32:02;32:03;"Yeah."
32:03;32:07;"At least it started with A Star is Born, which is a major"
32:07;32:08;"Hollywood motion picture."
32:08;32:10;"Now we're talking about listeners of the show"
32:10;32:14;"that don't like our outside work."
32:14;32:14;"That's right."
32:14;32:15;"That was an email."
32:15;32:18;"That's the VWTC zeitgeist."
32:18;32:20;"This is from Virginia."
32:20;32:20;"Howdy."
32:20;32:22;"First time caller, long time listener."
32:22;32:25;"So I made a Venn diagram contrasting VW fans and TC"
32:25;32:26;"heads after today's app."
32:26;32:30;"In the Vampire Weekend category, you get a fleece that I own,"
32:30;32:32;"my guitar, a comma--"
32:32;32:34;"I guess it's Oxford comma--"
32:34;32:37;"the two frogs from the Father's Day Weekend shirt,"
32:37;32:42;"a Ralph Lauren bear, Steve Buscemi, and a Vampire Weekend"
32:42;32:45;"album, Mitsubishi Macchiato, which doesn't exist."
32:45;32:47;"That's in the solely Vampire Weekend category."
32:47;32:50;"For the TC heads, you get the anti-Steve Miller,"
32:50;32:55;"Seinfeld 2000, Grateful Dead, Cheetos, One of Jake's,"
32:55;32:57;"Pizza Hut paintings, Can I Get a Number Crunch, Tim Horton,"
32:57;33:01;"Supreme Brick, Dunkin' Donuts, iced coffee,"
33:01;33:04;"the word brutal, and goldfish."
33:04;33:05;"In the middle of the--"
33:05;33:06;"The word brutal."
33:06;33:07;"Yeah, the word brutal."
33:07;33:11;"In the middle of the Venn diagram, what Virginia calls"
33:11;33:15;"the VWTC zeitgeist, you get Jake wearing an 8-minute Cape"
33:15;33:16;"Cod tie-dye."
33:16;33:17;"That makes a lot of sense."
33:17;33:18;"Solid."
33:18;33:21;"8-minute Cape Cod is a concept that Jake initially"
33:21;33:23;"pitched that became a reality."
33:23;33:26;"That's one of the true middle points of the Venn diagram,"
33:26;33:27;"8-minute Cape Cod."
33:27;33:28;"Tasteful palate."
33:28;33:30;"Well, I'd hope so."
33:30;33:33;"I'd hope that Vampire Weekend has a tasteful palate."
33:33;33:34;"Toblerone."
33:34;33:37;"That's a little bit the Neo-Yokio universe."
33:37;33:38;"Yeah, that's a separate Venn."
33:38;33:40;"Which we call the NYU."
33:40;33:42;"And then Joker Man font."
33:42;33:45;"That's true, because Joker Man font is--"
33:45;33:48;"we talked about on the show, but it's also on the Time Crisis"
33:48;33:51;"t-shirt, but also Vampire Weekend's working on a cover."
33:51;33:55;"And then the green spiral that we used on some--"
33:55;33:57;"Oh, on the Father's Day Weekend shirt."
33:57;33:57;"Yeah."
33:57;33:58;"OK."
33:58;33:59;"I buy it."
33:59;34:00;"Solid Venn."
34:00;34:02;"Solid Venn."
34:02;34:05;"So anyway, yes, there are TC heads who don't listen to"
34:05;34:06;"Vampire Weekend."
34:06;34:08;"And again, I get it."
34:08;34:09;"This is the ultimate art form."
36:35;36:48;"This email is actually from a Vampire Weekend fan."
36:48;36:50;"Because we also talked about what do we call"
36:50;36:51;"Vampire Weekend fans?"
36:51;36:53;"Nothing rolls off the tongue like TC head."
36:53;36:55;"The VW head is not good."
36:55;36:58;"Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
36:58;36:59;"Hello, TC crew."
36:59;37:02;"I don't know if there are many TC heads from Mexico,"
37:02;37:03;"but I'm one of them."
37:03;37:04;"Tight."
37:04;37:06;"Shout out to all Mexican TC heads."
37:06;37:08;"I've never written to a radio show slash podcast slash"
37:08;37:11;"whatever beats one radio is before."
37:11;37:13;"But I was listening to last episode three days later"
37:13;37:15;"from its airing in true TC fashion."
37:15;37:17;"And I think I have a good suggestion to finally solve"
37:17;37:20;"the Vampire Weekend fan base name conundrum,"
37:20;37:24;"spicing it up with a bit of corporate trivia for Mexico."
37:24;37:25;"I'm very intrigued."
37:25;37:27;"Every time you guys talk about Vampire Weekend"
37:27;37:30;"calling it VW, I can't help thinking about the big car"
37:30;37:32;"manufacturing corporation, Volkswagen."
37:32;37:33;"I know."
37:33;37:35;"Volkswagen is from Germany, not from Mexico."
37:35;37:36;"But please bear with me."
37:36;37:40;"VW's biggest assembly plant is located in Puebla, Mexico."
37:40;37:43;"It was built in the '60s mainly to manufacture the VW sedan,"
37:43;37:46;"also known as the original VW Beetle."
37:46;37:49;"I don't know if you guys visited Mexico sometime in the '90s,"
37:49;37:51;"but it was packed with VW Beetles."
37:51;37:53;"It became the most common car in the country."
37:53;37:54;"I didn't know that."
37:54;37:56;"Even all the taxi cabs were Beetles."
37:56;37:59;"The Beetle craze was so big in Mexico that people even came up"
37:59;38:02;"with a cute nickname for the car, Vocho."
38:02;38:05;"Everyone in Mexico knows the VW sedan Beetle as Vocho"
38:05;38:08;"or sometimes Vochito, when there is a more profound"
38:08;38:10;"emotional attachment to the car."
38:10;38:13;"Now, Ezra, I know, or at least I can guess from some of your lyrics"
38:13;38:16;"that you enjoy using some Spanish words occasionally."
38:16;38:17;"That's true."
38:17;38:19;"So I thought VW heads should be called Vochos,"
38:19;38:22;"a small catchy word that references the band's name initials"
38:22;38:24;"while also addressing a fun fact of corporate history"
38:24;38:26;"and thus relating it also to time crisis,"
38:26;38:29;"the show where the audience was asked to come up with names."
38:29;38:31;"As you guys say full circle, thanks for reading."
38:31;38:33;"This show does roll. Cheers, Javier."
38:33;38:35;"Great suggestion."
38:35;38:36;"Great suggestion."
38:36;38:38;"Okay, now, Javier is from Mexico,"
38:38;38:41;"so it's cool that Javier suggested this."
38:41;38:42;"How do you pull it off?"
38:42;38:44;"How do I pull it off, especially as a gringo?"
38:44;38:48;"I can't be getting on Twitter tomorrow, be like, ""Hey, guys."""
38:48;38:50;"From now on, our fans are called Vochos."
38:50;38:51;"You know what I mean?"
38:51;38:53;"That can't be a top-down directive."
38:53;38:54;"It wouldn't fly."
38:54;38:57;"I mean, even if it was, any name wouldn't work."
38:57;38:58;"I mean, like--"
38:58;39:00;"You just give up on this whole thing?"
39:00;39:02;"I mean, any sort of top-down directive,"
39:02;39:04;"if it's not organic, it's not going to work."
39:04;39:05;"But I do like the suggestion."
39:05;39:08;"Mexico is a very important country for Vampire Weekend."
39:08;39:09;"Really?"
39:09;39:10;"Yeah."
39:10;39:11;"You play a lot of shows there?"
39:11;39:12;"Not a lot. I want to play more."
39:12;39:16;"I once said I don't want to disrespect anybody."
39:16;39:18;"It's not because I don't love Europe,"
39:18;39:21;"but one time I did ask the people we work with,"
39:21;39:23;"managers, booking agents, whatever, I was like,"
39:23;39:26;"""What if instead of going to Europe, we just went to Mexico?"
39:26;39:27;"""Save a bundle on flights."""
39:27;39:30;"They're like, ""You really should go to Europe."""
39:30;39:31;"And I was like, ""No, no, you're right."
39:31;39:35;"""We've always had amazing shows in England and France."""
39:35;39:37;"I just never liked the--"
39:37;39:42;"Because when you're in a band, you basically tour the US and Europe constantly."
39:42;39:43;"Then maybe Australia and Japan."
39:43;39:45;"At least this is how it used to be."
39:45;39:48;"And then Latin America is always like this afterthought."
39:48;39:50;"Because it's hard. It's hard to go everywhere."
39:50;39:54;"And I always had this feeling that a lot of our best fans"
39:54;39:57;"were in Latin America, specifically Mexico."
39:57;39:58;"So there was part of me that was just kind of like,"
39:58;40:01;"""Why can't we just--instead of going to Europe for a month,"
40:01;40:04;"""why don't we go to Europe for a week and go to Mexico for a month?"""
40:04;40:06;"Just play a ton of shows there."
40:06;40:07;"Yeah."
40:07;40:10;"What if you did a week at one club in Mexico City?"
40:10;40:11;"I'd love it."
40:11;40:12;"We might lose a lot of money, but--"
40:12;40:13;"Would you?"
40:13;40:15;"You can't take it with you, man."
40:15;40:17;"That's true, man. What are you going to do?"
40:17;40:19;"Spend that money in heaven?"
40:19;40:21;"Why would you lose a lot of money?"
40:21;40:25;"Play like a week at a decent-sized venue in Mexico City?"
40:25;40:29;"Well, the whole infrastructure of touring, as I understand it--"
40:29;40:31;"I'm also really not a numbers guy."
40:31;40:33;"That's why I always have Seinfeld crunch the numbers."
40:33;40:36;"And don't get it twisted. I'm pretty good at math."
40:36;40:38;"But I don't like cracking open the books."
40:38;40:41;"I mean, not knowing anything, it seems like it would be efficient."
40:41;40:43;"You'd just move the gear once."
40:43;40:45;"You move it down from L.A. down to Mexico City."
40:45;40:48;"It's there for a week. It just sits on the stage all day."
40:48;40:52;"I think sometimes you're told that the most money you could possibly make--"
40:52;40:55;"and touring's expensive, so it's not always just about making money."
40:55;40:57;"It's about not losing money."
40:57;41:01;"But they would say the most money you could make is to go to each city once"
41:01;41:03;"and play the biggest show possible."
41:03;41:07;"So then if I come in and I'm like, ""Let's do a week in Mexico City,"""
41:07;41:09;"people would be like, ""Ezra, you're a dreamer."
41:09;41:13;"Never lose that spark of imagination, but got to keep the trains running."""
41:13;41:15;"What if it was more of like a DJ residency?"
41:15;41:19;"Like no band, just you, a couple of DJs."
41:19;41:22;"That takes a bit of the fun out of it."
41:22;41:24;"Live TC."
41:24;41:27;"I'm sure that I could go down to Mexico by myself,"
41:27;41:29;"crash on somebody's couch, and just DJ."
41:29;41:31;"That'd be so weak."
41:31;41:34;"That would suck. No, okay, I would love to make this happen."
41:34;41:35;"And actually, like I said--"
41:35;41:36;"DJing in Vegas?"
41:36;41:39;"Like I said, Vampire Weekend, we've always considered Mexico"
41:39;41:41;"to be one of our special countries."
41:41;41:44;"We've luckily never had terrible shows anywhere,"
41:44;41:46;"but there's just been certain countries--"
41:46;41:48;"The first time we started going to England,"
41:48;41:50;"we just felt connected to the fans there."
41:50;41:52;"It's like early adopters."
41:52;41:55;"And the first time we went to Mexico, we also felt a real connection."
41:55;42:00;"And I don't just mean this in the way that a singer on stage at a show"
42:00;42:06;"just being like, ""You know, man, we haven't been back to this city in five years."
42:06;42:09;"We f---ing love it here. Woo!"""
42:09;42:11;"People might be mad, but I'll say it."
42:11;42:13;"This might be the best crowd of the tour."
42:13;42:15;"[coughs]"
42:15;42:18;"I've probably said s--- like that, so I don't mean to put anybody on blast."
42:18;42:21;"But that's just the s--- that people say spur of the moment on tour."
42:21;42:24;"But I think the first time we went to Mexico was in 2009,"
42:24;42:27;"so it was in between the first and the second album."
42:27;42:30;"And we had a lot of time off there, so I always really liked this DJ"
42:30;42:33;"named Toy Selecta. I always listened to his remixes."
42:33;42:36;"And then we were at a party or something."
42:36;42:40;"The promoters took us out to a party, and we were just eating amazing food"
42:40;42:43;"and getting drunk. And sometimes you go to another country,"
42:43;42:45;"people are like, ""So you like Mexican music?"""
42:45;42:47;"I was like, ""Yeah, I like Mexican music."""
42:47;42:49;"I really like this Mexican DJ, Toy Selecta."
42:49;42:53;"And they were like, ""Oh, he's my friend, man. You should hang out with him."
42:53;42:56;"He's in the party."" And they were just like, ""Yo, come here."""
42:56;42:59;"And then we hung out, and then they took us to a rodeo."
42:59;43:02;"And then we went to Mexico City, and we had a lot of time off,"
43:02;43:05;"so we were like, ""Maybe we should record some of the next album here."""
43:05;43:09;"I'm a real homebody. I like to just be at somebody's home studio all the time."
43:09;43:11;"- Yeah, post up. - I like to post up."
43:11;43:14;"So we've never been on that, like, ""Let's travel to get a different vibe."""
43:14;43:17;"But we just happened to have time off. We were in the middle of recording an album,"
43:17;43:20;"so they were like, ""Yo, we can find you a cool studio in Mexico City."""
43:20;43:23;"It was owned by one of the people from a pretty well-known Mexican man"
43:23;43:28;"called Molotov. Like a beautiful old house, kind of in the same neighborhood"
43:28;43:31;"as like Frida Kahlo's house, like a great courtyard."
43:31;43:35;"And we recorded most of Cousins there."
43:35;43:37;"- Okay, cool. - So we were like, been working on it"
43:37;43:40;"for a few days in the studio. We took some pictures that ended up being"
43:40;43:43;"in the Contra booklet. And then we were like kind of, you know,"
43:43;43:45;"sometimes I really get in my head, like, ""I don't want to play new shit"
43:45;43:48;"unless it's ready."" But we just spent a few days recording it."
43:48;43:51;"So we had a show in Guadalajara, and we were like, ""F*** it, let's play Cousins."""
43:51;43:54;"So we played Cousins for the first time in Guadalajara, and the fans were sick."
43:54;43:57;"So, you know, it's like, maybe that's a fairly mundane story."
43:57;44:00;"But I'm just saying, that doesn't happen in every country."
44:00;44:04;"And then, you know, we really hung out with the promoter a lot."
44:04;44:07;"And actually, I saw him. You know, every country, you got like your main promoter."
44:07;44:09;"And I saw the dude at Lollapalooza this summer."
44:09;44:11;"He just happened to be there checking out bands and s***."
44:11;44:13;"And I was like, ""Yo, we got to go back to Mexico."""
44:13;44:16;"And he was like, ""Let's make it happen, man. Let's do something special."""
44:16;44:19;"- Love it. - Maybe I'll tell him, like, ""Yo, Jake has an idea."
44:19;44:21;"- Week residency."" - Oh, yeah."
44:21;44:23;"- Yo. - Dude, Richard Pictures."
44:23;44:25;"- I was just thinking that. - Vampire Weekend."
44:25;44:27;"- I was just thinking that. - Week-long residency in Mexico City."
44:27;44:30;"Vampire Weekend, Richard Pictures. Mexico City."
44:30;44:32;"- Five nights. - Five nights."
44:32;44:35;"I love that when bands do that. They have a stand."
44:35;44:38;"- Yeah. You can bring it. - The Dead did it."
44:38;44:41;"- We can bring everybody down. - Dirty Projectors just did it."
44:41;44:44;"- Right. We saw them at Zebulon. - I love it."
