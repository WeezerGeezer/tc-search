01:39;01:46;"- Time Crisis, season two, episode three."
01:46;01:49;"We're back, broadcasting from Los Angeles."
01:49;01:50;"I'm here with Jake Longstreth."
01:50;01:51;"What's up, Jake?"
01:51;01:52;"- Hey, how are you?"
01:52;01:53;"- Good to see you again, man."
01:53;01:55;"- Good to see you."
01:55;01:56;"- You're working on some great paintings."
01:56;01:57;"- Oh, thank you."
01:57;01:59;"- I really liked the Chase Bank ones."
01:59;02:00;"- Oh, cool."
02:00;02:00;"Yeah, I did this grid,"
02:00;02:04;"I did a piece that's nine Chase Bank paintings"
02:04;02:05;"hung on a grid."
02:05;02:06;"- All different locations."
02:06;02:07;"- Yeah."
02:07;02:08;"- But they all kind of look the same."
02:08;02:11;"- Yeah, it was an exploration"
02:11;02:14;"in this sort of homogenous retail architecture"
02:14;02:14;"that's everywhere."
02:14;02:16;"- Speaking of the retail landscape,"
02:16;02:17;"before the show started,"
02:17;02:19;"we were having a little conversation."
02:19;02:22;"This is something I've really been wanting to clear up."
02:22;02:24;"I saw a meme last week"
02:24;02:28;"that was a box of variety pack of chips."
02:28;02:29;"- Yeah."
02:29;02:30;"- And it was a picture of it"
02:30;02:34;"where all that's left are the Fritos,"
02:34;02:37;"like four bags of Fritos on the bottom of like a box."
02:37;02:39;"And then the meme was something like,"
02:39;02:43;"""You know you're hungry when you finally go eat the dregs"
02:43;02:44;"of the variety pack."""
02:44;02:48;"Basically implying that Fritos are the worst chip"
02:48;02:49;"that comes in a variety pack."
02:49;02:50;"- It's a little childish."
02:50;02:51;"- It's a little childish."
02:51;02:53;"First of all, I think if you support a company"
02:53;02:55;"such as the Frito-Lay company,"
02:55;02:56;"you gotta be all in."
02:56;02:58;"You don't play favorites."
02:58;03:01;"- You have to be all in with the full product line."
03:01;03:03;"- That's my personal belief."
03:03;03:04;"So then I was thinking about it and I was like,"
03:04;03:07;"""Well, so what is this anti-Frito thing?"""
03:07;03:09;"So you're somebody who thinks deeply"
03:09;03:11;"about the retail landscape."
03:11;03:14;"So I was wondering, is this something you're familiar with?"
03:14;03:16;"Did kids always hate Fritos?"
03:16;03:17;"Has that always been the case?"
03:17;03:18;"- I think so."
03:18;03:19;"I think it's the least sexy of the chip."
03:19;03:20;"- Why?"
03:20;03:22;"- It's the least sort of like caked"
03:22;03:26;"in that sort of orange powder, insane chemical flavoring."
03:26;03:29;"Now see, as a kid, I would go with the nacho cheese Dorito."
03:29;03:31;"No questions asked."
03:31;03:34;"And the Fritos would be this kind of like frail,"
03:34;03:36;"it's like a lateral move from like a tortilla chip."
03:36;03:38;"- You mean it's not even better than a tortilla chip?"
03:38;03:40;"- It's like barely a step up from tortilla chip."
03:40;03:43;"- There is something very like childish about Doritos."
03:43;03:46;"- Like your friend in eighth grade"
03:46;03:48;"with just that sort of like orange."
03:48;03:49;"- Orange mustache."
03:50;03:51;"- You know what it is also?"
03:51;03:56;"Like the Doritos breath is so like childish."
03:56;03:57;"- So brutal."
03:57;03:58;"- Like Doritos breath just reminds me"
03:58;04:02;"of like wrestling with like another kid,"
04:02;04:04;"like in somebody's attic or basement,"
04:04;04:07;"just like suplexing fools, just like Boston crab."
04:07;04:08;"- Mom!"
04:08;04:12;"- Yeah, just like literally like doing flips off a couch."
04:12;04:13;"- Tyler, what the hell, dude?"
04:13;04:17;"- Just like pulling some kid's head up in the camel clutch"
04:17;04:19;"and then just like smelling this disgusting thing"
04:19;04:20;"off their mouth."
04:20;04:22;"- Yeah, just imagine if you were like"
04:22;04:24;"getting intimate with somebody."
04:24;04:24;"- I was just thinking,"
04:24;04:26;"imagine kissing someone with Doritos."
04:26;04:29;"Imagine like first kiss, like eighth grade."
04:29;04:32;"- You know, the smell that I associate the most"
04:32;04:37;"with kind of like early romantic sexual stuff"
04:37;04:42;"was like this mix of Malibu and dentine fresh gum."
04:42;04:43;"- Holy."
04:43;04:44;"- Because remember when you're like a teenager,"
04:44;04:47;"sometimes there'd be like a group of people,"
04:47;04:48;"I don't know, this is at least how it was"
04:48;04:49;"in my weird little town,"
04:49;04:51;"be like a group of people and it's like basically,"
04:51;04:53;"all right, everybody's gonna pair off now"
04:53;04:55;"and it's like, everybody's like passing around the gum,"
04:55;04:59;"like everybody grab a stick of dentine fresh"
04:59;05:00;"and then you know, find an empty room."
05:00;05:01;"And then everybody's drunk,"
05:01;05:02;"but they also have like this like"
05:02;05:05;"really artificial mint flavor on there."
05:05;05:06;"- I wish I was at those parties."
05:06;05:08;"I had nothing going on in high school."
05:08;05:08;"- Really?"
05:08;05:09;"- Oh, nothing."
05:09;05:10;"- I didn't have a lot going on."
05:10;05:13;"I didn't have a lot, but like towards the end,"
05:13;05:15;"some very heavy drinking."
05:15;05:17;"- I had a girlfriend senior year of high school,"
05:17;05:19;"but it was stone cold sober."
05:19;05:20;"- Really?"
05:20;05:21;"- Very dry mouth."
05:21;05:24;"- My town was so hard drinking."
05:24;05:24;"- Interesting."
05:24;05:27;"- Going to school dances really drunk was the thing."
05:27;05:29;"'Cause you'd have to get super drunk at somebody's house."
05:29;05:31;"And again, this was not my day to day,"
05:31;05:32;"but even like with my friends,"
05:32;05:33;"there was like this thing of like,"
05:33;05:36;"well, we're going to the dance, I guess we have to,"
05:36;05:37;"I guess that's what you do."
05:37;05:39;"And then like some kid pulls out like,"
05:39;05:44;"well, my mom has this warm plastic bottle of beef eater gin."
05:44;05:47;"I guess we could just take shots of this, disgusting."
05:47;05:49;"- Wow, God, that was not my scene."
05:49;05:51;"- I've drank less in my thirties than in high school,"
05:51;05:53;"somehow I survived."
05:53;05:54;"- I mean, that's definitely an archetype."
05:54;05:56;"I mean, I just think I was sort of square"
05:56;05:58;"and just like hanging out with dudes."
05:58;06:00;"- I was square too, but my town was so small"
06:00;06:02;"that you couldn't help but get pulled into the orbit"
06:02;06:04;"of the cool kids."
06:04;06:07;"Anyway, we got a great show coming up."
06:07;06:09;"I'm glad we cleared up the whole Fritos thing."
06:09;06:12;"On this show, we're going to be talking a lot about demos,"
06:12;06:15;"songwriting samples, because the Beyonce album"
06:15;06:18;"has inspired a lot of conversation about this."
06:18;06:21;"I was a co-writer and co-producer on a song."
06:21;06:22;"So I've been having a lot of people like tweeting at me"
06:22;06:24;"the past couple of weeks about the song."
06:24;06:28;"So we're going to talk to Nikki Mayard,"
06:28;06:30;"a music journalist based in New York,"
06:30;06:33;"known as @JudNikki on Twitter."
06:33;06:35;"We're going to talk to her a little bit about"
06:35;06:38;"just kind of like the overall perception of Beyonce,"
06:38;06:42;"why people want to dissect her writing credit so much."
06:42;06:45;"I'm going to break down my collaboration with Beyonce"
06:45;06:48;"and many other people on this song called ""Holled Up."""
06:48;06:50;"Also get into some old Vampire Weekend songs,"
06:50;06:51;"kind of break down the component parts."
06:51;06:54;"And then we're going to have both of our good friend,"
06:54;06:56;"Ariel Rechshied, producer,"
06:56;06:59;"who co-produced the last Vampire Weekend album,"
06:59;07:02;"worked with The Himes, Sky Ferreira, Cass McCombs, et cetera."
07:02;07:05;"And he's going to break down the story of his involvement"
07:05;07:07;"in the Usher classic ""Climax."""
07:07;07:08;"- Great song."
07:08;07:09;"- Excellent song."
07:09;07:11;"And of course the top five."
07:11;07:12;"You ready, Jake?"
07:12;07:13;"- I'm pumped."

10:58;10:59;"- Okay, so as I said,"
10:59;11:01;"we're gonna be talking about the new Beyonce album."
11:01;11:02;"It's called Lemonade."
11:02;11:03;"You listened to it, Jake?"
11:03;11:05;"- I listened to it one and a half times."
11:05;11:07;"- Wow, I'm impressed."
11:07;11:07;"- Thank you."
11:07;11:09;"- 'Cause last time we were talking,"
11:09;11:11;"you didn't know who Future or Designer was."
11:11;11:12;"- That's true, I still don't."
11:12;11:13;"(laughing)"
11:13;11:15;"- But of course, but you know Beyonce is."
11:15;11:16;"- Absolutely."
11:16;11:17;"- And you listened to her album."
11:17;11:19;"This album Lemonade was a major event."
11:19;11:20;"- Huge."
11:20;11:21;"- It continues to be."
11:21;11:22;"- Yeah."
11:22;11:23;"- People are still talking about it."
11:23;11:26;"I've had a lot of people who are very confused"
11:26;11:28;"to see my name in the credits."
11:28;11:29;"So we're gonna talk a little bit about"
11:29;11:32;"how I got involved on this record."
11:32;11:34;"But first, to kind of talk about Beyonce in general,"
11:34;11:37;"we're gonna have a chat with Nikki Mayard,"
11:37;11:38;"the music journalist."
11:38;11:40;"So let's give her a call."
11:40;11:43;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
11:43;11:46;"(phone ringing)"
11:46;11:48;"- Hello?"
11:48;11:49;"- Hey, what's up?"
11:49;11:50;"- Hi, I'm good."
11:50;11:54;"- We're talking about Beyonce a bit today."
11:54;11:58;"And specifically, because I was one of the co-writers"
11:58;12:00;"of a song on the new album,"
12:00;12:04;"it'd been interesting seeing so many people's reactions"
12:04;12:07;"to the album, which by and large was positive."
12:07;12:10;"But I noticed I was getting added a lot"
12:10;12:12;"in different people's debates"
12:12;12:14;"about the writing of the album."
12:14;12:17;"And it seemed that who wrote what"
12:17;12:19;"was very important to people"
12:19;12:22;"in ways that sometimes seemed like just out of curiosity,"
12:22;12:25;"but sometimes in a slightly more negative way."
12:25;12:27;"So I thought that you as a music journalist"
12:27;12:30;"maybe could help contextualize for us."
12:30;12:32;"Why are people so fascinated"
12:32;12:35;"by how Beyonce songs in particular get written?"
12:35;12:36;"- I think a lot of it has to do"
12:36;12:38;"with what people have always seen Beyonce as."
12:38;12:42;"And I think that a lot of it is in Beyonce's presentation."
12:42;12:43;"Beyonce presents herself,"
12:43;12:46;"she has always been very in command."
12:46;12:50;"And that has led to the idea that Beyonce is a cyborg."
12:50;12:52;"Or that she's a pageant queen,"
12:52;12:54;"or that because she's very aware of who she is,"
12:54;12:56;"because she's very aware of the way"
12:56;12:58;"that she looks presence-wise, image-wise,"
12:58;12:59;"people see her as a pageant queen."
12:59;13:00;"And it really comes down to,"
13:00;13:02;"they're just not willing to believe"
13:02;13:05;"that a pop star, let alone a black woman,"
13:05;13:08;"could write something that has genre,"
13:08;13:10;"has depth, has anything to it."
13:10;13:12;"Because we kind of live in a culture"
13:12;13:15;"that's based on the belief that everyone who's famous"
13:15;13:16;"is not really that smart."
13:16;13:17;"- Right."
13:17;13:19;"It's interesting to me that traditionally"
13:19;13:23;"we accept that many of the greatest performers,"
13:23;13:28;"singers, whatever, don't necessarily write everything"
13:28;13:28;"that they sing."
13:28;13:31;"So it's not a surprise that Beyonce"
13:31;13:32;"has a lot of collaborators,"
13:32;13:34;"has worked with songwriters,"
13:34;13:36;"probably been given songs."
13:36;13:38;"Clearly she puts it together on this album"
13:38;13:42;"almost more than any into a much larger multimedia project."
13:42;13:44;"But people still almost seem to think"
13:44;13:47;"that if they can prove that she didn't write"
13:47;13:48;"a certain line or something,"
13:48;13:50;"that that somehow discredits the larger thing."
13:50;13:52;"Which is so weird to me,"
13:52;13:55;"because many of the greatest artists of all time"
13:55;14:00;"are curator, orchestrator, entertainers."
14:00;14:01;"It doesn't take away from the larger message"
14:01;14:03;"that an artist is putting out"
14:03;14:06;"because they collaborate with other songwriters."
14:06;14:08;"But with Beyonce, it's like a whole new conversation."
14:08;14:10;"- Well, I think also you have to think about the fact"
14:10;14:12;"that Beyonce is a woman."
14:12;14:14;"And I think that, number one,"
14:14;14:16;"is the first flat out reason that people do that."
14:16;14:18;"We see it commonly,"
14:18;14:19;"even with women that we really respect,"
14:19;14:22;"like old greats like Patti and Arita,"
14:22;14:24;"people are always really quick to remind people that,"
14:24;14:26;"""Oh, blah, blah, blah, I wrote this for her,"""
14:26;14:28;"or ""Blah, blah, I wrote this for her."""
14:28;14:29;"It's a huge conversation,"
14:29;14:31;"and it has been for a long time in culture,"
14:31;14:32;"the way we talk about music,"
14:32;14:35;"to make it seem like women are just faces."
14:35;14:37;"And the prettier you are,"
14:37;14:38;"the less people are willing to believe"
14:38;14:40;"that you can do something."
14:40;14:43;"People show a lot of false love for women behind the scenes."
14:43;14:45;"There's a lot of times where you'll see people be like,"
14:45;14:47;"""Oh, Esther Jean, and Rihanna stole that,"
14:47;14:49;"or she wrote that, Rihanna has that."""
14:49;14:52;"And I'm like, ""Yeah, but the song that she wrote"
14:52;14:53;"was for this person."""
14:53;14:58;"Her job as a songwriter is not to be Beyonce"
14:58;14:58;"or be Rihanna."
14:58;15:00;"Her job as a songwriter is to write songs"
15:00;15:01;"that they will sing."
15:01;15:03;"That's what she wants to do."
15:03;15:03;"- Right."
15:03;15:06;"- It just ties into such basic stuff."
15:06;15:10;"And when I think about how often people accredit"
15:10;15:13;"the way that Beyonce is doing more of a rap singing"
15:13;15:15;"kind of sound to Jay-Z,"
15:15;15:16;"which is like,"
15:16;15:18;"Beyonce's been doing this before she was dating Jay-Z,"
15:18;15:21;"but there's this disconnect"
15:21;15:26;"in seeing the linear legacy of a lot of women artists."
15:26;15:29;"And it really bothers me because I really do feel like"
15:29;15:31;"a lot of it is also a little bit racial,"
15:31;15:35;"a little bit the way that people talk about country singers"
15:35;15:37;"who are predominantly white,"
15:37;15:38;"and people love to talk about how those women"
15:38;15:41;"write all their songs, their soul, whatever."
15:41;15:42;"But when I look at R&B singers,"
15:42;15:44;"when I look at pop,"
15:44;15:46;"anyone that looks other,"
15:46;15:47;"people go through the liner notes"
15:47;15:49;"with like a fine tooth comb,"
15:49;15:50;"just to be like,"
15:50;15:51;"you know,"
15:51;15:52;"Beyonce wrote like one word on this,"
15:52;15:53;"which is like,"
15:53;15:54;"it doesn't matter."
15:54;15:55;"She's the vessel that delivers it."
15:55;15:57;"Nobody would be in the room"
15:57;15:59;"if they didn't think Beyonce was going to sing the song."
15:59;16:00;"- That was pretty funny for me"
16:00;16:03;"as somebody who was involved in the writing"
16:03;16:04;"of the song ""Hold Up"""
16:04;16:07;"is that so many people were going through it"
16:07;16:09;"as if, first of all,"
16:09;16:13;"there are many people credited as writers on the song."
16:13;16:14;"So it's not hidden."
16:14;16:15;"But people were like tweeting at me,"
16:15;16:16;"like as if they,"
16:16;16:19;"oh, actually the AES wrote that,"
16:19;16:22;"like as if they were like discovering something,"
16:22;16:23;"as if they were,"
16:23;16:24;"they found something out"
16:24;16:27;"that fully discredited the idea of Beyonce."
16:27;16:29;"And you know what the sad part"
16:29;16:30;"about the people so desperate"
16:30;16:31;"to pour through the liner notes"
16:31;16:33;"in a negative way is that,"
16:33;16:36;"and I imagine you feel the same way as a music journalist,"
16:36;16:38;"like we're both people who are obsessed with music."
16:38;16:40;"Going through the liner notes is supposed to be fun."
16:40;16:42;"It's supposed to be like exciting."
16:42;16:45;"And the idea that people turn into this negative thing"
16:45;16:46;"that it's undercutting something,"
16:46;16:48;"like I love knowing what the samples are,"
16:48;16:49;"who got together,"
16:49;16:50;"who wrote this and that,"
16:50;16:51;"like it's cool."
16:51;16:55;"It only makes me respect the artists more when I see that."
16:55;16:57;"- Yeah, to me, the liner notes are the story of a song."
16:57;17:01;"Like I remember when I started reading R&B liner notes"
17:01;17:03;"and being like, what, like who?"
17:03;17:04;"Like there was like the story of the song."
17:04;17:06;"It's like the origin story."
17:06;17:07;"And you start to think about like,"
17:07;17:10;"okay, like Father John Misty's on this song?"
17:10;17:11;"When did that happen?"
17:11;17:13;"And like when did Ezra get it?"
17:13;17:16;"Or like, you know, like when you tweeted like"
17:16;17:17;"a follow-up to the lyric"
17:17;17:19;"and the tweet was from four years ago"
17:19;17:20;"and I was like, I'm dying."
17:20;17:22;"'Cause it's just like all of a sudden it becomes like,"
17:22;17:26;"oh, Beyonce wrote this song about J.D. like two days ago."
17:26;17:28;"So like, oh crap, like this song is from four years,"
17:28;17:29;"you know, like this song has been,"
17:29;17:32;"how did these people not say anything?"
17:32;17:34;"They've been working on this for so long, you know?"
17:34;17:36;"And that to me, like you said,"
17:36;17:38;"you're taking away the joy of what is supposed to be"
17:38;17:41;"one of the most pleasurable parts of music."
17:41;17:45;"And I just feel like so much of the way we discuss music now,"
17:45;17:47;"especially the way we discuss bigger stars"
17:47;17:50;"because we live in a culture where people feel like"
17:50;17:52;"they know too much about the stars."
17:52;17:53;"And I think that creates a feeling"
17:53;17:56;"of this weird entitlement to them."
17:56;17:59;"And so now I think people get more focused"
17:59;18:00;"on the part of the lives of the stars"
18:00;18:01;"that they feel entitled to,"
18:01;18:04;"the part of the things they should be talking about."
18:04;18:07;"And then at the same time,"
18:07;18:08;"I feel like people are just finding more ways"
18:08;18:09;"to not enjoy music."
18:10;18:13;"- Right, maybe that's true of just life in general."
18:13;18:16;"The internet gives us so many ways to not enjoy life."
18:16;18:17;"- Like plastic or trash culture."
18:17;18:18;"- Yeah, exactly."
18:18;18:21;"- Try really hard not to like music."
18:21;18:22;"- Right, I think you're exactly right."
18:22;18:23;"Well, you know, Nikki, that's the perfect note"
18:23;18:27;"for us to get into our own story"
18:27;18:30;"or my part of the story of how that song came about."
18:30;18:31;"So I'm gonna kind of break it down"
18:31;18:34;"and play some of the early contributions of Hauk out there."
18:34;18:36;"But thank you so much for calling in."
18:36;18:38;"Pleasure talking to you and I hope you can come on again."
18:38;18:40;"- Absolutely, I would be happy to come on again."
18:40;18:41;"You guys have a good one."
18:41;18:42;"- You too."
18:42;18:43;"All right, bye."
18:43;18:44;"- Bye."

22:07;22:08;"Batteries not included."
22:13;22:15;"- So Jake, I wanna talk about the Beyonce song,"
22:15;22:17;"""Hold Up"" from Lemonade."
22:17;22:19;"- It's a good song."
22:19;22:20;"- Thank you."
22:20;22:21;"If I'm allowed to say thank you."
22:21;22:23;"- Well, are you?"
22:23;22:24;"(Jake laughs)"
22:24;22:24;"- That's a good question."
22:24;22:26;"- I'm psyched to find out what you did."
22:26;22:27;"- Yeah, I worked on it."
22:27;22:29;"See, a lot of people were confused."
22:29;22:31;"Basically, part of the confusion was"
22:31;22:34;"that the hook of the song is,"
22:34;22:36;"""Hold up, they don't love you like I love you."""
22:36;22:38;"And I wrote a tweet in 2011 that said,"
22:38;22:40;"""Hold up, they don't love you like I love you."""
22:40;22:41;"People were looking at the tweet."
22:41;22:42;"When the album came out,"
22:42;22:44;"then I wrote the second line."
22:44;22:46;"And so people were looking at this old tweet"
22:46;22:49;"and being like, ""Why did you post Beyonce lyrics in 2011?"
22:49;22:49;"""What does this mean?"
22:49;22:50;"""Did you just predict this?"""
22:50;22:52;"And then people were like, ""Well, hold on."
22:52;22:54;"""Isn't that just like, yeah, yeah's lyrics?"""
22:54;22:55;"And he just changed a word."
22:55;22:57;"And then some people started to be like,"
22:57;22:59;"""Maybe this guy just got credit on this Beyonce song"
22:59;23:02;"""because he tweeted some yeah, yeah's lyrics."""
23:02;23:03;"""Well, that's messed up."
23:03;23:04;"""What about the yeah, yeah?"""
23:04;23:06;"And so there's like this weird conversations about credit"
23:06;23:08;"and like, ""Did I trick Beyonce"
23:08;23:10;"""or did I just get credit 'cause of a tweet?"""
23:10;23:12;"I explained it as best I could 'cause people,"
23:12;23:14;"some people were very confused by it."
23:14;23:18;"But it's a lot easier to explain it with the music."
23:18;23:18;"- Great."
23:18;23:21;"- I guess one place to start would be with the sample"
23:21;23:23;"that the song is built around."
23:23;23:25;"And this is a Diplo special."
23:25;23:28;"And so I've worked with Diplo in the past."
23:28;23:32;"We did a song for Major Lazer called ""Jessica."""
23:32;23:33;"Not to be confused with the Allman Brothers song."
23:33;23:34;"- That's a tight title."
23:34;23:34;"- Thank you."
23:34;23:38;"I do think that's one of my best titles, Jessica."
23:38;23:41;"So Diplo, his real name is Wes."
23:41;23:43;"So maybe we'll make like a new Major Lazer song"
23:43;23:44;"or something."
23:44;23:46;"I get there, he plays me a bunch of beats"
23:46;23:47;"all over the place."
23:47;23:49;"And there's one that I really like."
23:49;23:50;"And I'm like, ""What's that one?"""
23:50;23:52;"And he's like, ""Oh, that's just kind of like this loop"
23:52;23:54;"""of this weird old '60s song."""
23:54;23:56;"He was kind of like filtering it."
23:56;23:58;"But essentially it was just a loop"
23:58;24:00;"that he was kind of like having some fun with."
24:00;24:01;"And I was like, ""Oh, I love that one."
24:01;24:04;"""So weird 'cause it almost sounds like a little like ska,"
24:04;24:05;"""but there's something weird about it."""
24:05;24:06;"And this is what he was looping,"
24:06;24:09;"was this Andy Williams song from the '60s"
24:09;24:11;"called ""Can't Get Used to Losing You."""
24:13;24:14;"Sound familiar?"
24:14;24:15;"- Yeah."
24:15;24:16;"- Bum, bum."
24:18;24:19;"So this is looped over and over again."
24:19;24:22;"This is what the real song sounds like though."
24:22;24:24;"♪ Guess there's no use in hanging around ♪"
24:24;24:25;"- Oh, cool."
24:27;24:30;"♪ Guess I'll get dressed and do the town ♪"
24:30;24:32;"- Guess Andy Williams is kind of like a crooner."
24:32;24:35;"♪ I'll find some crowded avenue ♪"

24:36;24:37;"♪ Avenue ♪"

24:44;24:46;"- It's like a schmaltzy '60s song."
24:46;24:47;"- Yep."
24:47;24:48;"♪ What I try to do with my life ♪"
24:48;24:51;"- So obviously the part that Wes had identified"
24:51;24:53;"and that he was turning into a beat"
24:53;24:54;"was just the beginning."
24:56;24:59;"♪ Uh, uh, uh, uh ♪"
24:59;25:01;"- And I'm not super tapped into the Diplo aesthetic,"
25:01;25:03;"but from what I've heard,"
25:03;25:06;"this seems pretty characteristic of his style."
25:06;25:07;"No?"
25:07;25:08;"- Well, it kind of reminds me,"
25:08;25:10;"like the song that Amber Kaufman did with him."
25:10;25:10;"- Oh yeah, sure."
25:10;25:13;"- Has similar, a similar kind of like,"
25:13;25:14;"- Well, yeah, like,"
25:14;25:15;"- feel or bounce or something."
25:15;25:17;"- Yeah, well, Major Lazer, I think,"
25:17;25:19;"was always supposed to be like Jamaican."
25:19;25:23;"Like collaborations with Jamaican artists,"
25:23;25:26;"samples of ska and reggae, dance hall,"
25:26;25:29;"futuristic dance hall type stuff."
25:29;25:30;"But so the fact that this has a little bit"
25:30;25:31;"of that ska offbeat,"
25:31;25:33;"♪ Bum, bum ♪"
25:33;25:34;"- Gives it a little bit of that"
25:34;25:36;"kind of Jamaican tropical feel."
25:36;25:36;"- Okay."
25:36;25:38;"- I'm sure Andy Williams wasn't trying to"
25:38;25:41;"make a ska song in 1964, but whatever."
25:41;25:43;"I think, I think Wes heard that"
25:43;25:45;"and identified it as something that kind of,"
25:45;25:46;"yeah, that fit his vibe."
25:46;25:50;"So he looped it and was kind of like,"
25:50;25:53;"like adding some like percussion and like filtering it."
25:53;25:55;"And so then I get, I was like, oh, I like that one."
25:55;25:57;"And then he says,"
25:57;25:59;"actually, I don't remember what he said."
25:59;26:00;"I'm not going to make up any fake dialogue."
26:00;26:01;"But then he was like, all right,"
26:01;26:02;"well, do you have an idea for a hook?"
26:02;26:04;"- No, please make up fake dialogue."
26:04;26:05;"- So Wes was like,"
26:05;26:08;"all right, bro, you're going to come,"
26:08;26:09;"you're going to come write a good hook on this?"
26:09;26:10;"And I was like,"
26:10;26:13;"Wes, you're right."
26:13;26:15;"I'm going to write a good hook on this."
26:15;26:15;"- I'm a professional."
26:16;26:17;"And he's like, all right, cool."
26:17;26:18;"I'm a professional too."
26:18;26:20;"And I was like, all right, let's do this."
26:20;26:24;"So then I didn't really have anything though."
26:24;26:27;"So I thought back to that tweet,"
26:27;26:31;"which all it says is,"
26:31;26:32;"hold up, they don't love you like I love you."
26:32;26:34;"Now, so now we got to kind of go back on the other branch."
26:34;26:36;"- Wait, so you just thought of that tweet?"
26:36;26:37;"- Yes."
26:37;26:38;"- Okay."
26:38;26:39;"- Sometimes I think about tweets."
26:39;26:40;"- Sometimes it pops in."
26:40;26:41;"- Right."
26:41;26:43;"So first for people who don't know,"
26:43;26:44;"to me, this is a very famous song,"
26:44;26:46;"but not everybody necessarily knows it."
26:46;26:48;"It came out a while ago."
26:48;26:51;"So this is the original song by the AES called Maps."
26:51;26:52;"You remember this?"
26:52;26:57;"So we can skip ahead to the chorus."
26:57;26:58;"- Yeah."
26:58;27:03;"- Wait, they don't love you like I love you."
27:03;27:03;"- Wait."
27:04;27:06;"- They don't love you like I love you."
27:06;27:15;"(singing)"
27:15;27:15;"- Do you remember that?"
27:15;27:16;"""Wait, wait."""
27:16;27:18;"- I actually don't, but I'm..."
27:18;27:19;"- Really?"
27:19;27:21;"What were you doing in 2004, man?"
27:21;27:22;"- Was that four?"
27:22;27:23;"- Yeah."
27:23;27:25;"Were you delivering for Papa John's in '04?"
27:25;27:26;"- No."
27:26;27:29;"Reasonable question."
27:29;27:31;"I was living in San Francisco."
27:31;27:33;"I was probably listening to Neil Young."
27:33;27:35;"- All right."
27:35;27:36;"- Not a lot's changed."
27:36;27:36;"- Okay."
27:36;27:38;"Well, that's a good song."
27:38;27:40;"- I never hit that New York, early 2000."
27:40;27:43;"I like the strokes, but the other New York, early 2000, eh."
27:43;27:46;"That's a whole separate conversation."
27:46;27:48;"- So that's the hook of Maps."
27:48;27:50;"Wait, they don't love you like I love you."
27:53;27:55;"So anyway, I don't know why I wrote that tweet."
27:55;27:55;"I just had to..."
27:55;27:58;"Maybe I just thought back in 2011, I was like,"
27:58;28:00;"""What if it was more like, 'Hold up,"
28:00;28:01;"they don't love you like I love you.'"""
28:01;28:02;"I don't know."
28:02;28:02;"I don't know what it is."
28:02;28:04;"- Wait, I'm sorry."
28:04;28:05;"The original lyric is what?"
28:05;28:07;"- Is, ""Wait, they don't love you like I love you."""
28:07;28:09;"- And then your tweet was?"
28:09;28:11;"- ""Hold up, they don't love you like I love you."""
28:11;28:12;"'Cause I like it in songs, it's like, ""Hold up."""
28:12;28:13;"- Okay."
28:13;28:14;"- And there's like a pause."
28:14;28:16;"""Hold up, they don't love you like I love you."""
28:16;28:17;"- Hold up."
28:17;28:18;"- Yeah, maybe that's what I was thinking."
28:18;28:21;"It was, ""Hold up, they don't love you like I love you."""
28:21;28:21;"I don't know what I was thinking."
28:21;28:23;"- So you changed it from, ""Wait"" to, ""Hold up."""
28:23;28:24;"- That's all I did in the tweet."
28:24;28:25;"- Okay."
28:25;28:26;"- And if that's all I did,"
28:26;28:29;"I probably don't really deserve any credit,"
28:29;28:31;"which is kind of amazing that some people thought"
28:31;28:32;"that that's all I did."
28:32;28:34;"I mean, well, hey, somebody's got to write,"
28:34;28:37;"change, ""Wait"" to ""Hold up,"" whatever."
28:37;28:40;"So I'm hanging with Diplo,"
28:40;28:43;"and I'm listening to his beat."
28:43;28:46;"And just to remind people, it was this looped."
28:46;28:48;"Now remember this again?"
28:48;28:49;"- Yeah."
28:49;28:53;"- So Wes is looping that, and he's, ""You gonna write a hook?"""
28:53;28:55;"And I said, ""You're damn right, I'm gonna write a hook."""
28:55;28:57;"So then I think back to this tweet,"
28:57;28:58;"""Hold up, they don't love you like I love you."""
28:58;29:00;"And I think, ""Okay, how could this go?"""
29:00;29:04;"And then I write a hook that sounds like this."
29:04;29:07;"So this is the original demo that I made with Wes that day."
29:07;29:12;"I see it was added to my iTunes, March 18th, 2014."
29:12;29:13;"So we made this."
29:13;29:16;"And also just so people understand,"
29:16;29:17;"a lot of times when you're working with somebody,"
29:17;29:19;"you might not write the whole song that day."
29:19;29:22;"So you might say, ""Make me a bounce of the song"
29:22;29:23;"where the verses are empty,"
29:23;29:25;"but have my hook on it in the meantime."""
29:25;29:28;"So this is the original demo that we made,"
29:28;29:30;"I guess in March, 2014."
29:55;29:57;"So that was the first demo that we made."
29:57;30:00;"So I took it home, I was listening to it a lot."
30:00;30:03;"- One question, in your version it was,"
30:03;30:05;"""What a way to love the God above you."""
30:05;30:06;"- Yeah, right."
30:06;30:08;"So the lyrics were changed in the final version."
30:08;30:11;"So in my version, I sang,"
30:11;30:14;"♪ Can't you see there's no other God above you ♪"
30:14;30:17;"Which, it's funny, I was thinking about this."
30:17;30:19;"♪ So can't you see there's no other God above you ♪"
30:19;30:22;"♪ What a wicked way to treat the man who loves you ♪"
30:22;30:25;"I sound very lethargic on the demo, but,"
30:25;30:26;"so then it's funny."
30:26;30:28;"So we're talking all about how like where ideas come,"
30:28;30:30;"how songs are kind of intertextual."
30:30;30:32;"So it's funny, now that the song came out,"
30:32;30:33;"I was thinking about it again."
30:33;30:35;"I was thinking about the original lyrics that I wrote,"
30:35;30:37;"""Can't you see there's no other God above you."""
30:37;30:38;"And then I was thinking like,"
30:38;30:40;"this sounds like something I would write,"
30:40;30:42;"but I couldn't remember like, what was I thinking?"
30:42;30:43;"What is it?"
30:43;30:47;"It was just like, using the word wicked is very like biblical."
30:47;30:48;"And then I was like, ""Oh, right."
30:48;30:50;"Where does no other God above you come from?"""
30:50;30:52;"And then I realized that's from the Bible."
30:52;30:55;"""You shall place no other God before me."""
30:55;30:58;"That must've been kind of like where the phrase came from."
30:58;30:59;"Because you know, there's only one God."
30:59;31:01;"Yeah, I didn't think the Bible referenced other gods,"
31:01;31:02;"but that's besides the point."
31:02;31:05;"Well, because people used to be pagans."
31:05;31:09;"God came down to Abraham."
31:09;31:10;"You really should know this."
31:10;31:13;"I don't know my biblical history at all."
31:13;31:15;"But so she changed it to..."
31:15;31:16;"She changed it to,"
31:16;31:18;"""Can't you see there's no other man above you."
31:18;31:20;"What a wicked way to treat the girl who loves you."""
31:20;31:23;"So that version there, look from there,"
31:23;31:26;"I came up with other versions, diploaded other versions,"
31:26;31:28;"but that would have been, I believe,"
31:28;31:32;"the first version that Beyonce heard."
31:32;31:34;"So in some ways, that's like the point on the tree"
31:34;31:37;"that leads to the final version."
31:37;31:39;"And then from there, a lot of other people got involved"
31:39;31:42;"in writing the verses, things changed,"
31:42;31:45;"but essentially the hook stayed the same."
31:45;31:46;"Great melody."
31:46;31:47;"Thank you."
31:47;31:48;"But so it's interesting to me,"
31:48;31:50;"like people get really hung up on like, ""So who wrote what?"""
31:50;31:52;"Like, I know what I wrote, you know?"
31:52;31:55;"And in some ways I served as like a middle ground"
31:55;31:58;"between the AAS and Beyonce."
31:58;32:00;"But it's funny to think about like,"
32:00;32:02;"so what does writing really mean?"
32:02;32:03;"Because of course I'm like proud."
32:03;32:04;"I think I wrote a good hook."
32:04;32:07;"I think I had a good idea to like riff on the AAS."
32:07;32:09;"But then I was thinking about it like,"
32:09;32:11;"now when I listen back to the demo,"
32:11;32:12;"it sounds different to me"
32:12;32:15;"because like she contextualized the song."
32:15;32:18;"So like she's made this like great video"
32:18;32:20;"where she's like, you know, bashing windows and stuff."
32:20;32:21;"And it's also funny."
32:21;32:24;"Like when I wrote that, it wasn't directed at anybody."
32:24;32:25;"I was just kind of like songwriting."
32:25;32:27;"You know, like there's Vampire Weekend songs"
32:27;32:28;"that have like very deep meaning to me"
32:28;32:30;"that feel like personal or like,"
32:30;32:32;"that one I was kind of just like,"
32:32;32:33;"I was kind of like songwriting."
32:33;32:34;"I was like, ""Oh, this is a good hook."""
32:34;32:37;"I wasn't thinking about anybody in particular."
32:37;32:39;"And the idea that those words"
32:39;32:41;"now are contextualized by this album,"
32:41;32:44;"by the video, by her as a performer and a curator."
32:44;32:45;"I like it."
32:45;32:46;"I think it has deeper meaning."
32:46;32:49;"Well, it's also highly personal for her"
32:49;32:51;"if you were to believe the narrative of the album."
32:51;32:52;"Yeah, right."
32:52;32:52;"Exactly."
32:52;32:53;"So I think -"
32:53;32:55;"Which makes it way more powerful"
32:55;32:58;"to substitute God for guy or man."
32:58;33:00;"Yeah, if this had stayed a Vampire Weekend song,"
33:00;33:02;"because then after I was listening to it for a few months,"
33:02;33:05;"I said to Wes, ""Let's not make it a major lead song."
33:05;33:06;"I want this to be a Vampire Weekend song."""
33:06;33:07;"And you're like, ""All right."""
33:07;33:10;"But then things change."
33:10;33:11;"But when I think about it,"
33:11;33:14;"like it would have been a good Vampire Weekend song."
33:14;33:15;"You know, up until two weeks ago,"
33:15;33:17;"I wasn't sure if it was going to make the album."
33:17;33:18;"You never know in these situations."
33:18;33:20;"So I was kind of like,"
33:20;33:23;"""Maybe this would be a Vampire Weekend song."""
33:23;33:26;"In which case I would have kept God and it might have -"
33:26;33:29;"maybe I eventually would have found a deeper personal meaning in it."
33:29;33:30;"Yeah, but -"
33:30;33:31;"Maybe not."
33:31;33:32;"Maybe not."
33:32;33:34;"And so then you get into this idea of like,"
33:34;33:36;"""All right, so I wrote this hook."
33:36;33:37;"It doesn't really make it -"
33:37;33:40;"Of course, I feel some sense of ownership over what I did,"
33:40;33:43;"but it doesn't like feel like my song."
33:43;33:46;"She really did bring a different resonance and meaning to it."""
33:46;33:48;"So the idea that like people are trying to like -"
33:48;33:50;"I think it's cool that like all these things came together."
33:50;33:52;"It's like, it's a very modern way of a song coming together."
33:52;33:55;"But does that take away -"
33:55;34:00;"99% of the world will always hear those words and associate it with Beyonce."
34:00;34:00;"Yeah."
34:00;34:09;"It go down in the DM time crisis with Ezra Koenig on Beats 1."
34:09;34:13;"So then I was thinking about other songs that kind of have unusual paths,"
34:13;34:16;"where different ideas come together."
34:16;34:18;"And in some ways, those are my favorite songs."
34:18;34:22;"So the Vampire Weekend song that kind of has the squirreliest path to the finished product"
34:22;34:26;"is probably our song Step, which was on the last album."
34:26;34:29;"So if anybody wonders what that sounds like, it sounds like this."
34:29;34:34;"Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl."
34:39;34:46;"So the way that that song started also was kind of like inspired by other ideas floating around."
34:46;34:51;"The way that song really came together was - there was this, you know, Souls of Mischief?"
34:51;34:51;"No."
34:51;34:54;"They started in the early 90s, Bay Area rap group."
34:54;34:58;"Probably their most famous song was 93 Till Infinity."
34:58;35:00;"And this was like a B-side."
35:00;35:03;"Or maybe it was never released until recently."
35:03;35:05;"But somehow, like I heard this and I always really loved it."
35:05;35:08;"So this was the Souls of Mischief song."
35:08;35:11;"I think they were like teenagers from the early 90s called Step to My Girl."
35:11;35:30;"Just like good early 90s hip-hop."
35:30;35:32;"Yeah, beautiful old samples."
35:32;35:35;"I used to fret that my honey would lay me for one with more pegs."
35:35;35:38;"Still it was funny 'cause she paid no mind as jerks lurked constantly."
35:38;35:41;"And my insecurity turned into maturity."
35:41;35:43;"As the years passed, I find it hard to be monogamous."
35:43;35:46;"So do other brothers, so the scene still surnamines."
35:46;35:48;"Catch crazy glares when I'm with female company."
35:48;35:51;"Something I'm a zombie and they step to her in front of me."
35:51;35:56;"So in public places, I am often found in my trunk, reaching for bats and smack goes the saw."
35:56;35:56;"Because I have the right to -"
35:56;35:58;"I'm hearing the melody and the sax line."
35:58;35:58;"Right, yeah."
36:06;36:08;"It's like a little different, but that part's the same."
36:20;36:23;"Yeah, so I'd listen to this all the time and the -"
36:23;36:27;"I guess like the melody of the sax kind of seeped into my brain and then the chorus."
36:28;36:31;"Which is coming up, which is also samples."
36:41;36:42;"Oh."
36:42;36:42;"Yeah."
36:42;36:45;"So, yeah, I'd listen to the song all the time."
36:45;36:47;"And I always thought it was like really beautiful."
36:47;36:48;"I didn't know what the samples were though."
36:48;36:50;"Like in the 90s you listen to it or -"
36:50;36:55;"No, I probably found - I probably downloaded an mp3 of it in the early 2000s."
36:55;36:57;"Okay, so you just - okay."
36:57;37:00;"So I didn't know too much about the origins of it."
37:00;37:05;"But I always just knew I really liked this song called ""Step to My Girl""."
37:05;37:10;"Then, you know, at some point, you know, sometimes you just start singing in your head."
37:10;37:15;"And I guess I sang something that kind of took part of the melody from the saxophone."
37:15;37:18;"And then took the line, ""Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl""."
37:18;37:21;"There's always something I really liked about that line."
37:21;37:24;"Because it's not just like every - there's something about every time I see you in the world,"
37:24;37:27;"you always step to my girl. I don't know, I just liked it."
37:27;37:30;"So then I kind of started writing, ""Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl""."
37:30;37:35;"And then, ""The gloves are off""."
37:35;37:36;"So I always thought that was really pretty."
37:36;37:38;"So then, start working on it."
37:38;37:41;"So then of course, when you're working on a song, you got to start saying like,"
37:41;37:44;"""Well, okay, what am I actually referencing here?"""
37:44;37:49;"Because I believe good music is full of references, but you can't just like, you know,"
37:49;37:51;"melodies have to be cleared."
37:51;37:52;"That's how our law works."
37:52;37:55;"Other things don't, but melodies have to be cleared."
37:55;37:59;"So then I had to look up what Souls of Mischief had sampled."
37:59;38:06;"And what they sampled was a song called Aubrey by the saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. from the 70s."
38:06;38:07;"Oh, I'm familiar."
38:07;38:18;"So this is the original sample, the Grover Washington Jr. sample that that song's based on."
38:18;38:23;"Gorgeous 70s production."
38:23;38:26;"Yeah, this is almost like new age meets smooth jazz."
38:26;38:30;"A weird period."
38:30;38:33;"There you go."
38:33;38:37;"""Gloves are off""."
38:37;38:46;"Tender."
38:46;38:49;"Yeah, so the melody goes other places, but you know, the main part is..."
38:49;38:51;"So you had to clear that."
38:51;38:59;"Well, yeah, so but so then we're like, all right, so they sampled Grover Washington Jr. playing his song called Aubrey."
38:59;39:04;"But then what of course I didn't know, but I found out was that this is a cover."
39:04;39:09;"So they sampled Grover Washington Jr. doing an instrumental cover of a song called Aubrey."
39:09;39:10;"Written by?"
39:10;39:12;"Written by Bread."
39:12;39:13;"Oh!"
39:13;39:14;"70s soft rock."
39:14;39:17;"We're getting even deeper into the 70s malaise here."
39:17;39:21;"So also like imagine like for me, I'm like, oh, this song is like kind of based on ""Souls of Mischief""."
39:21;39:27;"But then little did I know that what I was actually basing the melody off was not ""Souls of Mischief"", was not even Grover Washington Jr.,"
39:27;39:34;"but was Bread. This like real just kind of smooth 70s easelist."
39:34;39:36;"So this is the original song that the melody comes from."
39:36;39:42;"The name of that band is one of the most perfect examples of the name of the band describing the sound of that band."
39:42;39:44;"Yeah, I mean, it's literally White Bread."
39:44;39:47;"It's White Bread."
39:47;39:55;"Like the band teacher at my high school, Mr. Jackson, he was like a real like old school jazz head."
39:55;39:57;"And he and then we were in jazz band."
39:57;40:03;"And this is funny because this is at a predominantly white high school where you're in jazz band like playing,"
40:03;40:12;"you know, Night in Tunisia and like old standards and he would always stop and be like, no, no, it's not swinging."
40:12;40:16;"It sounds like white bread. And I just remember being like, I vaguely understood what he was saying,"
40:16;40:23;"but it's like the like the other kids who are just like basically just there after school to like get a credit from their applying to college."
40:23;40:32;"Just be like, Mr. Jackson, I have a field hockey practice coming up and you just be like, no, just like this, like 14 year olds."
40:32;40:37;"Sounds like he'd always be like, sounds like white bread and creamed corn."
40:37;40:43;"What? Anyway, bread is very white bread. And this is the original Aubrey that Grover Washington Jr."
40:43;40:52;"Covered. This is what the original song sounds like. Love those 70s strings."
40:52;40:57;"I remember buying a bread greatest hits in the dollar bin and really, really wanting to connect."
40:57;41:10;"And I just couldn't. Really? I'll go check it out. So that's basically it."
41:10;41:18;"When you get down to it, what I interpolated in the song is, which is this part."
41:18;41:30;"And Aubrey was her name, her name. Just basically a three note interval at this point. Yeah."
41:30;41:36;"So it's kind of crazy. I mean, I guess it's fair, though. That is what I based it on."
41:36;41:44;"So if you go look at the credits for Step, I believe I'm credited, Rostam's credited, and the guy from Bread is credited."
41:44;41:46;"But then it's even deeper than that, because."
41:46;41:50;"So we talked to Souls of Mischief, because of course, we reached out to them and said,"
41:50;41:52;"we're basing it off these elements of your song."
41:52;41:57;"But it turned out the elements of the song that we were basing it off of were not actually their intellectual property."
41:57;42:00;"So they were like, well, you know, we sampled Grover Washington Jr."
42:00;42:02;"And then we're like, that's a cover of Bread."
42:02;42:07;"And Aubrey was her name. The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out."
42:07;42:15;"Yeah, that's the same interval. And then we said, well, the other part that we kind of reference in our song is the chorus."
42:15;42:18;"Because remember their song, the chorus goes, ""Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl."""
42:18;42:22;"And they're like, well, that's a sample, too."
42:22;42:26;"So it kind of sounded like a sample, because if you go back and listen to it, it sounds like they're cutting up records."
42:26;42:40;"So it sounded like that probably was a sample. I wasn't like shocked, but I was like, all right, well, what's the sample?"
42:40;42:51;"And they're like, well, the sample is this not super well-known, not obscure, but not super well-known New Jersey 90s rapper called YZ."
42:51;42:55;"And they sampled his voice on their song. And it came from his song called Who's That Girl?"
42:56;43:01;"Ah, yeah. Hey, baby, why you keep stepping up to my girl? You know who she is."
43:01;43:06;"You want to get dissed or what? I don't like dissing shit."
43:06;43:10;"But you will get one if you keep stepping up to her. You know what I'm saying?"
43:10;43:12;"Listen up. Just listen up."
43:12;43:17;"I'm sorry, baby, but the girl means more to me than you. Without the girl, what would I do?"
43:17;43:22;"But with her, I'd do just about anything. She's my queen and I'm her king. Together we sing."
43:22;43:26;"She's my S, my O, my N, my A. I'm her YZ and we're sitting in a tree."
43:26;43:31;"K-I-S-S-K-I-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G."
43:31;43:35;"You saw me and you got hurt, but it's not my fault that your feelings are constantly at work."
43:35;43:40;"Pounding and always making sounds like, but it's time to step down."
43:40;43:43;"Girl, I don't want no static, but every time you see me, you grab at it."
43:43;43:49;"You got to have it. And we broke up about two years ago and you still be hawking, always talking that."
43:49;43:54;"Ooh, I said, girl, what is she to you?"
43:54;43:58;"Baby, you better stop doing that."
43:58;44:03;"Ooh, I said, girl, what is she to you?"
44:03;44:06;"What is she to you?"
44:06;44:11;"You caught up in an old romance. Girl, it's time to take a chance on a new love."
44:11;44:16;"Like Jodi once said, time to step up. Not at a one-stop shop, but a grocery market."
44:16;44:21;"Your heart is at a halt no more. It was my fault and I'm sorry that my love was a woozy."
44:21;44:24;"But don't get the oozy, 'cause I don't want to die yet. I know where your head's at."
44:24;44:28;"Forgive and forget. Let's start a new road. Let's lay a new path."
44:28;44:33;"I don't want to build a route. Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl."
44:33;44:34;"You hear it?"
44:34;44:35;"Yeah, yeah, no, I heard it."
44:35;44:36;"You seem confused."
44:36;44:40;"No, no, no, no. It's like, I thought it would be like the chorus or something."
44:40;44:42;"No, it's just like a part of the verse."
44:42;44:43;"It's just like a random line."
44:43;44:45;"Every time I see you in the, they made it a chorus."
44:45;44:46;"Yeah, that's interesting."
44:46;44:49;"So then we had to track down YZ, clear it with him."
44:49;44:52;"How'd that go?"
44:52;44:57;"You know, I let the business people handle that one because, you know, it can get complicated tracking people down."
44:57;45:03;"Like, I don't know if it was via his lawyer or what, but I don't know if anybody talked to him directly, but"
45:03;45:05;"of course we made sure that it was cleared."
45:05;45:10;"But so ultimately I was kind of riffing on this ""Sold to Mischief"" song,"
45:10;45:13;"but then it turns out I'm actually riffing on ""Bread"" and YZ."
45:13;45:17;"I love, yeah, I love that it goes from ""Bread"" to ""YZ""."
45:17;45:20;"It was also so random that I ended up back at ""Bread""."
45:20;45:22;"Dude, that is so..."
45:22;45:24;"Yeah, I..."
45:24;45:27;"""And all B was her name."""
45:27;45:31;"It's like so epic and so banal at the same time. It's crazy."
45:31;45:35;"Yeah, it's like, well, and that ultimately is how I feel about music is like, of course,"
45:35;45:39;"if you're sampling somebody or interpolating them, you got to clear it up to a point."
45:39;45:43;"But yeah, it's kind of like, it's natural in a way."
45:43;45:47;"Like, it seems crazy that it... And then also the more you think about it, it's like, it's not crazy."
45:47;45:49;"We all grew up listening to all sorts of music."
45:49;45:53;"People sample stuff. Grover Washington knew this ""Bread"" song wanted to cover."
45:53;45:54;"It is kind of just how music works."
45:54;45:57;"So this is the first song I thought of when I was thinking about the whole Beyonce thing,"
45:57;46:01;"where people were like, ""Oh, all these different... She stole this line."""
46:01;46:06;"And it's kind of like, no, it's actually pretty cool that like all these different people came together"
46:06;46:08;"and she still made the song her own."
46:08;46:12;"I would like to think that the Vampire Weekend song, we made our own."
46:12;46:16;"Like at the end of the day, like I can play you all that stuff and hopefully you still listen to Vampire Weekend"
46:16;46:19;"and that song sounds like us."
46:19;46:25;"We've never tried to hide the references in it, but writing a song like that is not easier."
46:25;46:26;"You know what I mean?"
46:26;46:27;"Of course."
46:27;46:30;"Writing a song that's not easier than sitting down at the piano."
46:30;46:31;"It's just as hard."
46:31;46:36;"Like God might give you a melody when you sit at the piano and you still got to do something with it."
46:36;46:40;"If bread gives you a melody, you still got to figure out how to write a song around it."
46:40;46:42;"No, that's fascinating."
46:42;46:46;"I mean, yeah, like that experience of writing music and being like, ""Did I write this?"""
46:46;46:49;"I remember there's a story of Paul McCartney wrote yesterday."
46:49;46:51;"He woke up from a dream."
46:51;46:53;"Oh, right. And he wrote ""Scrambled Eggs."""
46:53;46:55;"Scrambled eggs."
46:55;46:59;"And then he played yesterday for friends of his for the next few days being like,"
46:59;47:04;"""Did I write this or is this some old song that's in all of our subconsciousnesses"
47:04;47:07;"that I somehow..."" And everyone's like, ""No, I've never heard that before."""
47:07;47:09;"And eventually he was like, ""I guess I wrote it."""
47:09;47:13;"And then it sounded like a song that everybody had heard before and became a song that everybody heard."
47:13;47:18;"And truthfully, a lot of good songs are rooted in old folk melodies or something."
47:18;47:19;"It's not really a big deal."
47:19;47:23;"But anyway, that's the convoluted story of how Step came together."
47:23;47:27;"Not a million miles away from Hold Up, but I never play Vampire Weekend on the show."
47:27;47:31;"So I'm going to play Step in its entirety now."
47:31;47:33;"Here's Vampire Weekend."
47:33;47:36;"Who? With their hit song, Step."
47:37;47:40;"Time Crisis with Ezra Kainan."
47:40;47:46;"Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl."
48:11;48:14;"Back, back, way back, I used to front lock and go out."
48:14;48:17;"Mechanicsburg, Anchorage, and Dar es Salaam."
48:17;48:20;"We're lonely in New York with champagne and disco."
48:20;48:23;"Tastes of Mélanie/San Francisco."
48:23;48:26;"But actually, Oakland and Alameda."
48:26;48:29;"Your girl was in Berkeley with a communist reader."
48:29;48:33;"Mine was in town with a boombox and Walkman."
48:33;48:36;"I was a horrible girl that was back then."
48:42;48:46;"The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are off."
48:46;48:48;"But you're on a ball."
48:48;48:51;"I feel it in my bones."
48:54;48:58;"I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house."
48:58;49:00;"Such a modest mouth."
49:00;49:03;"I can't do it alone."
49:06;49:12;"Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl."
49:41;49:43;"I want to slow to the sound of the master."
49:43;49:47;"The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are off."
49:47;49:49;"But you're on a ball."
49:49;49:52;"I feel it in my bones."
49:55;49:59;"I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house."
49:59;50:01;"Such a modest mouth."
50:01;50:04;"I can't do it alone."
50:04;50:08;"I can't do it alone."
50:20;50:23;"Wisdom's a gift but you trade it for youth."
50:23;50:26;"Age is an honor to stand out the truth."
50:26;50:29;"You saw the stars when they hid from the world."
50:29;50:32;"You cursed the sun when it stepped to your girl."
50:32;50:35;"Maybe she's gone and I can't resurrect her."
50:35;50:38;"The truth is she doesn't need me to protect her."
50:38;50:41;"We know the true death, the true way of our flesh."
50:41;50:45;"Everyone's dying but girl, you're not old yet."
50:45;50:48;"The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are off."
50:48;50:50;"But you're on a ball."
50:50;50:53;"I feel it in my bones."
50:56;51:00;"I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house."
51:00;51:02;"Such a modest mouth."
51:02;51:05;"I can't do it alone."
51:08;51:12;"The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are off."
51:12;51:14;"But you're on a ball."
51:14;51:17;"I feel it in my bones."
51:20;51:24;"I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house."
51:24;51:26;"Such a modest mouth."
51:26;51:29;"I can't do it alone."
51:29;51:33;"I can't do it alone."
51:33;51:36;"Every time you see me here in the world,"
51:36;51:39;"you always step to my girl."
51:40;52:05;"[instrumental]"
52:05;52:08;"Back, back, way back, I used to front like I was Don Juan."
52:08;52:11;"Couldn't settle down, couldn't find a girl to hold on."
52:11;52:14;"Used to get my roll on, hit the spot to stroll on."
52:14;52:17;"Now I found one with a handle like the hoedown."
52:17;52:20;"Every time I'm with her, dudes always wanna stare."
52:20;52:23;"I be staring back like, ""Dude, I wanna go there."""
52:23;52:26;"Used to didn't care, now I hit you with a chair."
52:26;52:29;"If that's just so happens, I just rain on her hair."
52:29;52:32;"Now me and Shorty Wap spending more and more time."
52:32;52:35;"So since she got my heart, then I gotta have her spine."
52:35;52:38;"And if any fool try to come for what's mine,"
52:38;52:41;"a pair of science guns where the sun don't shine."
52:41;52:44;"The sugar and my Kool-Aid, fool, get me through these."
52:44;52:47;"Swear to God, one day I might watch her throw a bouquet."
52:47;52:50;"Said, ""Nowhere on this earth, nowhere in this world"
52:50;52:53;"I should ever, ever see you step into my girl."""
52:53;52:56;"That's my old girl, my old girl from college."
52:56;52:59;"I always think about her when the leaves turn orange."
52:59;53:02;"Yeah, we went to Wesleyan and she scoffed at Vassar."
53:02;53:05;"I met her at a wine and cheese, I looked right past her."
53:05;53:08;"Apparently, she would notify me right after."
53:08;53:12;"I smashed her the first night, the first pipe's the worst pipe."
53:12;53:15;"But after, I satisfy her thirst like, ""Mmm."""
53:15;53:19;"The pastor will satisfy the church like, ""She lived in West Coe"
53:19;53:22;"and she studied frescoes and head to toes."
53:22;53:25;"She stayed in the best clothes. I represent Queens."""
53:25;53:27;"She would move out to Brooklyn."
53:27;53:30;"Never thought that she would have a precious heart tooken"
53:30;53:33;"by a shy brown guy from Bell Rose"
53:33;53:36;"that stayed in shelters until hell froze."
53:36;53:39;"Her freckles dance on her porcelain skin."
53:39;53:42;"It's like she got a special force within."
53:42;53:45;"And I've been high, but ain't no higher place"
53:45;53:49;"than alongside her by the fireplace."
53:49;53:52;"Act like you ain't even seen me standing next to her."
53:52;53:55;"I'll tie your kicks together if you ever try and step to her."
53:55;53:58;"Must be why you trippin' when I ask you why you stressin' her."
53:58;54:02;"Passin' notes and textin' her, I'm 'bout to shoot the messenger."
54:02;54:05;"Used to smash, slap 'em on the ass and go away the ass"
54:05;54:08;"when I'm a call 'em and I hit 'em with a poker face."
54:08;54:11;"Coldest shoulder known to blow a load and leave 'em frozen."
54:11;54:14;"Skate Magnum rapper in the trash, I told 'em nothin' gold can stay."
54:14;54:17;"Who's she? Guess I turn over a new leaf."
54:17;54:20;"Now I'm choosin' groups A through D over group E's."
54:20;54:23;"Lose sleep lately, only countin' on these two sheep."
54:23;54:27;"You and me, baby, skippin' town up on these coupe seats."
54:27;54:30;"Must've broke them all when they made you."
54:30;54:33;"Probably broke a nail or two flippin' off these lame dudes."
54:33;54:36;"Tolerant in plain view, ask 'em what's your name, boo?"
54:36;54:39;"Barely had a dollar and a dream, but it came true."
54:39;54:43;"The gloves are on, the wisdom teeth are out."
54:43;54:48;"Got you on a bow, I feel it in my bones."
54:48;54:51;"I feel it in my bones."
54:51;54:54;"I'm strong enough, I'm ready to fall."
54:54;54:57;"The high, such a nice night."
54:57;55:00;"I can't do it alone."
55:03;55:07;"The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out."
55:07;55:12;"Got you on a bow, I feel it in my bones."
55:12;55:15;"I feel it in my bones."
55:15;55:18;"I'm strong enough, I'm ready to fall."
55:18;55:21;"The high, such a nice night."
55:21;55:24;"I can't do it alone."
55:24;55:28;"I can't do it alone."
55:28;55:34;"Every time I see you ignore, you always stick to my bed."
55:34;55:39;"That was Vampire Weekend Step Remix featuring Danny Brown,"
55:39;55:41;"Heems, and Despot."
55:41;55:42;"Oh, Despot."
55:42;55:44;"Another host on Time Crisis."
55:44;55:48;"It started life as a bread song, then became a rap song,"
55:48;55:51;"then became a Vampire Weekend song, then became a rap song again."
55:51;55:53;"It's the circle of life."
55:53;56:00;"I was thinking about how most music is based on shared melodies historically,"
56:00;56:05;"and how people are still, even about almost 40 years into the hip-hop era,"
56:05;56:11;"get kind of confused by how people might recontextualize an idea or a melody or a lyric."
56:11;56:14;"But I was thinking back in history, this is something that happened a lot."
56:14;56:18;"Folk melodies were people would do whatever they wanted with them."
56:18;56:19;"Right."
56:19;56:23;"So, I was thinking about a certain song that most of us are familiar with and its origins."
56:23;56:24;"People might not know this song."
56:24;56:28;"Have you ever heard of the song called To Anacreon in Heaven?"
56:28;56:29;"I don't know."
56:29;56:30;"I don't think so."
56:30;56:33;"Well, this is a song from the 18th century."
56:33;56:35;"It's very popular in London."
56:35;56:40;"And it was the official song of the Anacreontic Society,"
56:40;56:43;"which was a gentleman's club of amateur musicians in London."
56:43;56:49;"It's this kind of goofy song, kind of referencing old Greek mythology."
56:49;56:54;"They're talking about Venus and Bacchus and all these crazy things happening."
56:54;56:58;"It's almost like the song about a big crazy free-for-all with all the Greek gods."
56:58;56:59;"Yeah."
56:59;57:02;"Obviously, we don't have recordings from the 18th century,"
57:02;57:05;"but I thought I might play a version that we found."
57:05;57:10;"This is a version of this weird 18th century London gentleman's club song,"
57:10;57:12;"To Anacreon in Heaven."
57:12;57:15;"This is sung by a guy named Douglas Jimerson."
57:15;57:16;"I just want to play this for people."
57:16;57:19;"This is kind of the original of this."
57:19;57:26;"To Anacreon in Heaven where he sat in Hogley"
57:26;57:33;"A few sons of harmony sent a petition"
57:33;57:39;"That he their inspired patron would be"
57:39;57:46;"When this answer arrived from the jolly old Grecian"
57:46;57:52;"Voice, fiddle, and flute, no longer be mute"
57:52;57:59;"I'll lend you my name and inspire you to put"
57:59;58:01;"So I think you see where I'm going with this, Jake."
58:01;58:02;"You recognize the melody?"
58:02;58:03;"Yeah, I do."
58:03;58:06;"It's our national anthem."
58:06;58:15;"The merplah be us with the person's vine"
58:15;58:16;"It does sound like a bar song."
58:16;58:18;"You can just picture these guys drunk."
58:18;58:26;"So, of course, one day, some dude says like,"
58:26;58:28;"""You know, that's a really good song."
58:28;58:33;"But what if instead of being about the Greek gods having a free for all,"
58:33;58:38;"what if we made it about something even more exciting?"""
58:38;58:40;"We're starting this country."
58:40;58:42;"We got a new flag."
58:42;58:43;"There was a battle."
58:43;58:45;"Some pretty out there political philosophies."
58:45;58:47;"We got some pretty out there political philosophies."
58:47;58:51;"You'd also think there's something ironic about the whole point of America,"
58:51;58:54;"supposedly, was that we were escaping British tyranny,"
58:54;58:56;"but we used a British Gentleman's Club melody."
58:56;59:00;"But anyway, in case anybody at home is not familiar,"
59:00;59:04;"I'm skipping ahead a couple centuries, but basically we ended up with this."
59:04;59:14;"Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light"
59:14;59:16;"You know, Winnie Houston."
59:16;59:17;"This is big."
59:17;59:19;"What year are we talking?"
59:19;59:21;"Early '90s, maybe '92."
59:21;59:22;"Super Bowl?"
59:22;59:24;"Yeah, let's assume it's the Super Bowl."
59:24;59:27;"Winnie Houston just singing the Super Bowl."
59:27;59:29;"All of America is watching."
59:29;59:33;"60,000 football fans just with their hands on their heart."
59:33;59:35;"Just like weeping."
59:35;59:39;"Weeping at how beautiful our country is."
59:39;59:44;"And they're singing the melody from these like a bunch of goofball gentlemen"
59:44;59:47;"getting like faced in London."
59:47;59:49;"Can you imagine if we started our own country?"
59:49;59:51;"Oh yeah."
59:51;59:53;"What terrible song would we use?"
59:53;59:56;"That reminds me, when I was in middle school,"
59:56;59:59;"we had to do some kind of like civics lesson thing."
59:59;01:00:02;"I don't know, I guess it was for like history class or whatever it's called in 6th grade."
01:00:02;01:00:04;"And you had to make up your own country."
01:00:04;01:00:08;"And the idea was to teach you about like what would you value in a country or something."
01:00:08;01:00:12;"And like, you know, some kids would be like, well, in my country, we would like take care of poor people."
01:00:12;01:00:17;"Or like my, probably other kids would be like, you know, my country would be all about the free market."
01:00:17;01:00:19;"Probably not in 6th grade."
01:00:19;01:00:22;"But I remember it was kind of like you got to make a flag for your country."
01:00:22;01:00:23;"Yeah."
01:00:23;01:00:26;"And you got to pick the national anthem."
01:00:26;01:00:30;"I think in 6th grade I would have chose ""Pour Some Sugar On Me."""
01:00:30;01:00:33;"Believe in freedom."
01:00:33;01:00:36;"Believe in freedom with me."
01:00:36;01:00:39;"Cause the country is in our hands."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"That already sounds like a song."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"Come on get it on."
01:00:41;01:00:44;"What are those lyrics even?"
01:00:44;01:00:53;"Well, on that note, let's play a new anthem for, what would your country be called?"
01:00:53;01:00:58;"Like let's imagine it's 6th grade and the teacher's like, all right, Jake, like what's your country called?"
01:00:58;01:01:01;"It's like probably like Jake land."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"Yeah."
01:01:02;01:01:07;"Or like I was really into the Yankees, like Mattingly land."
01:01:07;01:01:08;"Really rolls off the tongue."
01:01:08;01:01:11;"The People's Republic of Mattingly."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"North Mattingly."
01:01:13;01:01:15;"Don Mattingly is president for life."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"Mrs. Napolitano."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"Jake Longstreth."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"I worked really hard on my project."
01:01:20;01:01:24;"My country is called the Democratic People's Republic of Mattingly."
01:01:24;01:01:27;"And our national anthem is ""Pour Some Sugar On Me."""
01:01:27;01:01:28;"[MUSIC - THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF MATTINGLY, ""POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME""]"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"Hey."
01:01:30;01:01:33;"Hey."
01:01:36;01:01:41;"Love is like a bomb, baby, come and get it on."
01:01:41;01:01:44;"Living like a lover with a red iPhone."
01:01:44;01:01:47;"Looking like a tramp like a video vamp."
01:01:47;01:01:50;"Demolition woman, can I be your man?"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"Hey."
01:01:52;01:01:55;"Hey."
01:01:55;01:01:58;"Rattling and dazzling, a flashy little light."
01:01:58;01:02:01;"Television lover, baby, cool all night."
01:02:01;01:02:04;"Sometimes, anytime, sugar me sweet."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"Little missy, innocent, sugar me."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"Yeah."
01:02:07;01:02:10;"Yeah."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"So come on."
01:02:12;01:02:15;"Take a bottle."

01:04:37;01:04:39;"Also in real life."
01:04:39;01:04:42;"Also in real life because you are a producer."
01:04:42;01:04:47;"I think I first met you because you co-produced with Ross Tham, Modern Vampires of the City."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"That's true."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"That's where we met."
01:04:49;01:04:52;"Classic Vampire Weekend album, our last album."
01:04:52;01:05:01;"But you're also known for producing Hyme, Cass McCombs, Sky Ferreira, Solange losing you."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"You were one of the producers on that, right?"
01:05:02;01:05:05;"I think technically I got mixing credit on that one."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"Okay."
01:05:06;01:05:07;"He's a producer."
01:05:07;01:05:08;"He's out there mixing."
01:05:08;01:05:10;"He's out there producing, songwriting."
01:05:10;01:05:13;"You produced Hey There, Delilah."
01:05:13;01:05:14;"Yeah."
01:05:14;01:05:16;"I mean, you've done a lot of different stuff."
01:05:16;01:05:17;"What do they say?"
01:05:17;01:05:20;"You got to be able to shoot from anywhere in the court."
01:05:20;01:05:21;"Exactly."
01:05:21;01:05:26;"So today we've been breaking down different songs, talking about how songs come together."
01:05:26;01:05:27;"Okay."
01:05:27;01:05:28;"Right."
01:05:28;01:05:30;"The elements that go into making a song, you know, sometimes there's interpolations, but"
01:05:30;01:05:33;"sometimes it's also just different people collaborating in a studio."
01:05:33;01:05:37;"The Beyonce one started with me and Diplo collaborating in a studio."
01:05:37;01:05:43;"And one song that's definitely one of the high points of your resume is Usher Climax."
01:05:43;01:05:45;"Proud moment for me."
01:05:45;01:05:46;"Major song."
01:05:46;01:05:47;"You know that song, Jake?"
01:05:47;01:05:48;"Yeah, I love it."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"It's great."
01:05:49;01:05:50;"It's a great song."
01:05:50;01:05:51;"Many people's favorite."
01:05:51;01:05:53;"Definitely one of the top Usher songs."
01:05:53;01:05:56;"And just when it came out, it was like nobody'd heard anything like it."
01:05:56;01:05:58;"So technically that song is produced by you and Diplo."
01:05:58;01:05:59;"That's right."
01:05:59;01:06:00;"And Wes and I both had the same idea."
01:06:00;01:06:03;"So we were cutting straight to like the pop tracks uptempo."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"We're like, we're going to go work with this superstar pop artist."
01:06:05;01:06:07;"We want to, let's get one of those."
01:06:07;01:06:08;"Right."
01:06:08;01:06:09;"That's fun."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"Big song."
01:06:10;01:06:11;"Yeah, big song."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"We're playing stuff and nothing's really lighting up."
01:06:13;01:06:17;"And at one point I just randomly, I started playing a track and I'm pretty much playing"
01:06:17;01:06:18;"out of Wes."
01:06:18;01:06:20;"Wes had a lot of the starter material."
01:06:20;01:06:21;"Yeah."
01:06:21;01:06:25;"And I was going to work off of whatever we kind of decided to, whatever resonated."
01:06:25;01:06:29;"So I start playing something and Usher, I could see him like light up a little bit."
01:06:29;01:06:32;"He hears this little bit of music and he kind of lights up and all of a sudden there was"
01:06:32;01:06:40;"eye contact and then the beat drops and it turns into this kind of house-y type song."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"Yeah."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"And he lost it again."
01:06:42;01:06:46;"And then we flipped through a bunch more stuff and then, you know, it was sort of a fail"
01:06:46;01:06:47;"for a little while there."
01:06:47;01:06:48;"Right."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"And I brought the session."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"I have the session."
01:06:51;01:06:52;"I thought maybe I could demonstrate something."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"Yeah, sure."
01:06:53;01:06:55;"I'm going to play a little bit of what he heard."
01:06:55;01:06:58;"I don't have the actual original demo of the song."
01:06:58;01:06:59;"Right."
01:06:59;01:07:02;"So I'm just sort of doing a little approximation of what he heard."
01:07:02;01:07:03;"Yeah."
01:07:03;01:07:07;"And this is the session for the actual finished product of Climax."
01:07:07;01:07:08;"So he heard this bit."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"At this moment he was kind of intrigued."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"He liked the little like bleep, bleepy bloops."
01:07:19;01:07:21;"Yeah, he was like, okay, okay."
01:07:21;01:07:22;"That's what I'm talking about."
01:07:22;01:07:23;"I haven't heard that yet."
01:07:23;01:07:27;"And then this is sort of an approximation of the groove and like what happened was the"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"song."
01:07:36;01:07:37;"And he didn't like this."
01:07:37;01:07:38;"This is where we lost him."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"Right."
01:07:39;01:07:42;"He was like, that was cool, but now you're on some like Euro house, whatever."
01:07:42;01:07:43;"Yeah."
01:07:43;01:07:45;"I'll call Max Martin if I want that."
01:07:45;01:07:46;"Right."
01:07:46;01:07:47;"You know."
01:07:47;01:07:48;"Yeah."
01:07:48;01:07:49;"You guys are trash."
01:07:49;01:07:51;"But it was good that you noticed what he liked."
01:07:51;01:07:55;"Well, I was very focused and it was, but that is it too."
01:07:55;01:07:59;"You got to read, you know, music is a difficult language to talk about."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"Well, sometimes you hear something."
01:08:01;01:08:03;"It's not always easy to say, you know what?"
01:08:03;01:08:04;"I like part of it."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"Here's what we have to do."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"You just have a weird feeling."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"You're like, I kind of like something about, yeah."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"Yeah."
01:08:09;01:08:13;"It's all about reading body language and understanding the, you know, everybody in"
01:08:13;01:08:14;"the room, understanding each other."
01:08:14;01:08:16;"And it takes time to get to that point."
01:08:16;01:08:17;"And you don't always have that kind of time."
01:08:17;01:08:19;"So that's when things just don't work out."
01:08:19;01:08:22;"So at any rate, we knew he didn't want it to be that tempo."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"So Wes and I decided let's halftime it."
01:08:24;01:08:28;"So we took that main part and then I went to the other room and I started to,"
01:08:28;01:08:31;"there's a sort of a root note that's going throughout that whole thing,"
01:08:31;01:08:32;"a drone."
01:08:32;01:08:34;"I started to build chords around it."
01:08:42;01:08:45;"This is as much, if not less than what we had, you know."
01:08:45;01:08:46;"Right."
01:08:46;01:08:48;"But you started to give it some more harmonic shape."
01:08:48;01:08:53;"And then Wes came in with a really, really simple halftime."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"Like couldn't be more bare bone."
01:08:57;01:08:58;"Right."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"Very simple, minimalist."
01:08:59;01:09:01;"Got about this much going."
01:09:01;01:09:02;"Yeah."
01:09:02;01:09:05;"At some point had another opportunity to play it for us or play it for him."
01:09:05;01:09:07;"And he just started getting really into it."
01:09:07;01:09:09;"You know, you could just see that he was really excited."
01:09:09;01:09:12;"And we were just in the room playing it just like we are right here."
01:09:12;01:09:14;"And he's about as close to me as you are."
01:09:14;01:09:15;"Yeah."
01:09:15;01:09:19;"And he just starts riffing acapella."
01:09:19;01:09:22;"And it just happened to be in this range."
01:09:26;01:09:28;"Like very high, delicate."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"Just a beautiful falsetto."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"Yeah, falsetto, yeah."
01:09:30;01:09:33;"And live and direct, it's just really, really moving."
01:09:33;01:09:34;"Right."
01:09:34;01:09:36;"And unlike anybody I had worked with before."
01:09:36;01:09:38;"Because this is before you met me."
01:09:38;01:09:39;"That's right."
01:09:40;01:09:41;"That was just before."
01:09:41;01:09:46;"And so after writing two verses and two choruses, where do we go with it next?"
01:09:46;01:09:50;"Well, we came up with some chords, but we wanted to make it just really epic"
01:09:50;01:09:53;"and beautiful, kind of pull out the violins."
01:09:53;01:09:59;"But we don't know anyone who's basic enough to just pull out the average violin."
01:09:59;01:10:02;"So we called our friend, your friend, all of our friends,"
01:10:02;01:10:06;"Nico Muhly, who put together a really nice arrangement."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Nico Muhly, legendary."
01:10:08;01:10:09;"Legendary."
01:10:09;01:10:11;"Arranger, composer."
01:10:11;01:10:12;"My man is a legend."
01:10:12;01:10:14;"So what did he do on climax?"
01:10:21;01:10:28;"So this is Nico bringing that kind of new classical Philip Glass energy."
01:10:28;01:10:29;"So play that in context."
01:10:34;01:10:36;"Very nice."
01:10:36;01:10:38;"Just classy."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"Beautiful."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"Well, Ariel, thanks so much for sharing your story."
01:10:49;01:10:51;"My pleasure, guys."
01:10:51;01:10:53;"That's the story of how Climax came together."
01:10:53;01:10:55;"Now we've got to listen to the whole song now."
01:10:55;01:10:56;"Run it."
01:10:56;01:10:58;"Here's Usher with Climax."
01:10:58;01:10:59;"Run it, Jake."
01:11:11;01:11:15;"Going nowhere fast"
01:11:15;01:11:19;"We've reached the climax"
01:11:19;01:11:23;"We're together now we're undone"
01:11:23;01:11:29;"I won't commit so we choose to run away"
01:11:29;01:11:33;"Do we separate"
01:11:33;01:11:37;"Don't wanna give in so we both gave up"

01:12:44;01:12:48;"We made a mess, what it used to be love"

01:16:27;01:16:30;"But we made our peace, he's a good guy"
01:16:30;01:16:33;"He has strong feelings about Seinfeld which I respect"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"So he's actually here in the studio"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"So guys, Seinfeld2000, welcome"
01:16:37;01:16:40;"Hey Ezra, Jake, thanks for having me back"
01:16:40;01:16:42;"And I'm so glad that we could patch things up"
01:16:42;01:16:43;"Oh, me too"
01:16:43;01:16:44;"What are you doing in LA, man?"
01:16:44;01:16:47;"Oh, for sure, well, you know the whole Seinfeld, like, the cast and crew"
01:16:47;01:16:48;"Like, most of them are out here"
01:16:48;01:16:51;"So it just kind of made, like, it made sense for me to be here"
01:16:51;01:16:53;"I know you guys have been talking about, like, interpolations"
01:16:53;01:16:56;"And like, kind of, you know, song origins and demos"
01:16:56;01:17:01;"So, you know, I asked earlier if people would send in, like, some demos"
01:17:01;01:17:04;"Of, you know, what the iconic Seinfeld theme song"
01:17:04;01:17:07;"Composed by the god Jonathan Wolf would sound like"
01:17:07;01:17:08;"[Laughs]"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"Wait, Jonathan Wolf is the guy who composed the original?"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"Yeah, Jonathan Wolf, uh, yeah"
01:17:12;01:17:15;"He's, you know, he's the god of music, you know, in my opinion"
01:17:15;01:17:18;"Like, he created something iconic and beautiful"
01:17:18;01:17:21;"So I was just asking, you know, if people"
01:17:21;01:17:25;"My Twitter followers would, you know, send in"
01:17:25;01:17:29;"What they think the Seinfeld theme song would sound like"
01:17:29;01:17:31;"If it came out today"
01:17:31;01:17:32;"Oh, that's interesting"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"Yeah, show us what you got, man, what'd you get?"
01:17:34;01:17:38;"So first of all, this one came in, you know, from my boy Ted Phillips"
01:17:38;01:17:41;"And he's called this one ""Juror Get"" theme song"
01:17:41;01:17:44;"And it's a little bit, it's a little bit avant-garde"
01:17:44;01:17:46;"But I like it, check it out"
01:17:46;01:17:53;"What do you think of that?"
01:17:53;01:17:54;"[Laughs]"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"This is like Seinfeld shreds"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"Yeah, it's hot"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"I like that little, little break there"
01:18:00;01:18:01;"Um"
01:18:01;01:18:02;"Lo-fi"
01:18:02;01:18:03;"It's lo-fi"
01:18:03;01:18:05;"That's more Jake's Alley"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"Yeah, I would've thought this was like '93"
01:18:07;01:18:09;"This is like some weird '93 cassette vibe"
01:18:09;01:18:11;"Yeah, yeah, it's fine"
01:18:11;01:18:12;"I like it"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"Oh, I'm so sorry"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"That was from the next thing"
01:18:16;01:18:20;"So, um, so I kind of came up with an interpretation of what, you know"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"What the show would be like with that theme song"
01:18:22;01:18:27;"And, you know, what I thought of was that Seinfeld is entirely set in virtual reality"
01:18:27;01:18:30;"And Jerry is an abstract impressionist painter"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"And a performance artist struggling to make his way"
01:18:32;01:18:36;"In an immersive second-life world style version of New York City"
01:18:36;01:18:38;"Based on that one?"
01:18:38;01:18:39;"No?"
01:18:39;01:18:40;"I'm not getting that"
01:18:40;01:18:41;"Alright"
01:18:41;01:18:42;"So check this one out"
01:18:42;01:18:45;"This is by, um, by Cooper Worth"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"On Twitter"
01:18:47;01:18:59;"Okay"
01:18:59;01:19:01;"Higher production value"
01:19:01;01:19:05;"This is kind of like Nintendo"
01:19:05;01:19:06;"Yeah"
01:19:06;01:19:08;"Yeah, that's sort of what I came up with"
01:19:08;01:19:11;"I said, you know, this would be for like a Seinfeld prequel"
01:19:11;01:19:13;"The year is 1987"
01:19:13;01:19:18;"And Jerry is a video game designer working for Nintendo's Super Nintendo Power Glove"
01:19:18;01:19:21;"But he's forced to become a comedian after getting fired"
01:19:21;01:19:25;"Because his neighbor, Cram, ruins the glove by using it to lose the contest"
01:19:25;01:19:28;"By using it to masturbate"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"I like the- oh yeah, I know, I got your reference"
01:19:30;01:19:31;"Okay"
01:19:31;01:19:33;"Loud and clear"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"And then actually, yeah"
01:19:35;01:19:37;"So, um, I gotta roll out"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"But thanks so much for having me on the show"
01:19:39;01:19:40;"Oh, thanks for coming, man"
01:19:40;01:19:45;"I really- I'm really glad that, you know, we went from being kind of each other's worst enemies"
01:19:45;01:19:47;"To friends and collaborators"
01:19:47;01:19:51;"And that you can come on the show and like help facilitate kind of a cool segment"
01:19:51;01:19:52;"Talking about demos"
01:19:52;01:19:53;"And it was really on topic"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"And yeah, thanks man, it was awesome"
01:19:55;01:19:57;"Thanks, I put a lot of effort into it"
01:19:57;01:19:59;"And, um, I think it went over really well"
01:19:59;01:20:00;"Absolutely"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"Alright, nice to meet you, Jake"
01:20:02;01:20:03;"Great to meet you"
01:20:03;01:20:04;"Okay"

01:20:05;01:20:06;"Bye"
01:20:06;01:20:11;"Okay, actually, um, I did wanna play one demo that I came up with myself"
01:20:11;01:20:14;"And I spent quite a bit of time putting it together"
01:20:14;01:20:16;"But I think it's gonna really delight you"
01:20:16;01:20:17;"Oh, you made your own Seinfeld demo?"
01:20:17;01:20:21;"Yeah, I spent a few days, uh, just, you know, I sort of hunkered down in the lab"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"And, you know, I think I came up with something pretty great"
01:20:23;01:20:24;"Oh, awesome, let's hear it"
01:20:24;01:20:25;"Sure"
01:20:25;01:20:30;"Wait, wait"
01:20:30;01:20:33;"Wait, did you make this?"

01:20:43;01:20:44;"Yes, this was what happened at Green Day"
01:20:44;01:20:45;"Get out"

01:20:48;01:20:49;"No, no, no, stop it"
01:20:49;01:20:50;"No, you know I was just messing around"
01:20:50;01:20:51;"No, it's not funny"
01:20:51;01:20:52;"It's not funny"
01:20:52;01:20:56;"I, ah, ooh, ow, man, I was really starting to like you, man"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"And I really loved the segment"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"And then you come on and Rick Roll me on my own show"
01:21:00;01:21:04;"The disrespect, I mean, people talk about Donald Trump"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"And the breakdown in civility in this country"
01:21:06;01:21:09;"And I just got a taste of it on my own show"

01:26:19;01:26:21;"Oh, like you heard it?"
01:26:21;01:26:24;"No, I was only familiar with him because I was driving out to Palm Springs"
01:26:24;01:26:28;"and there were billboards every like 8 miles on the 10"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"advertising a Calvin Harris gig"
01:26:30;01:26:32;"Oh, in Vegas probably"
01:26:32;01:26:34;"I texted you, I was like, who's Calvin Harris?"

01:26:59;01:27:00;"Wait, wait, real quick"
01:27:00;01:27:05;"Remember the story about how Calvin Harris started a conversation with me on Instagram comments?"
01:27:05;01:27:07;"Oh right, he was trying to sell you some gear"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"That's how you know he's a true G"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"Yeah, because Calvin Harris is a real music head"
01:27:11;01:27:16;"My man went public with a conversation with me about random gear"
01:27:16;01:27:17;"Yeah, he's a gear head"
01:27:17;01:27:21;"Because people always try to like degrade DJs and be like, oh they're just press play"
01:27:21;01:27:24;"Calvin Harris is a composer, a gear head, a musician"
01:27:24;01:27:29;"If you dig into his early catalog, I mean, he was a synth guy"
01:27:29;01:27:32;"Right, so Calvin Harris is literally hitting up Ariel on Instagram"
01:27:32;01:27:35;"being like, dude, you wanna buy my mixing desk?"
01:27:35;01:27:36;"That's right"
01:27:36;01:27:38;"People are flipping out, people are like, what is happening right now?"
01:27:38;01:27:41;"You were really blessed when you got that Calvin Harris comment in your Instagram"
01:27:41;01:27:45;"So this is his song, ""This is What You Came For"" featuring Rihanna"
01:27:45;01:27:48;"The long-awaited follow-up to ""We Found Love in a Hopeless Place"""
01:27:48;01:27:49;"Let's give it a listen"
01:27:49;01:27:53;"It's a hit, I already love it"
01:27:53;01:27:54;"That's what I said to him"
01:27:54;01:27:58;"Jake's taking it in"
01:27:58;01:28:00;"I haven't heard it yet, have you heard it?"
01:28:00;01:28:02;"I've heard... yeah"
01:28:02;01:28:11;"Got that real modern vocal chop"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"Nailed it, nailed the vocal chop"
01:28:13;01:28:16;"Talking about climax, this is going somewhere"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"Ooh"
01:28:19;01:28:24;"Light break, this is what you came for"
01:28:24;01:28:25;"Light break"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"You feel the rising action?"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"I don't like it, but I feel it"
01:28:29;01:28:33;"And everybody's watching her"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"She's looking at you"
01:28:35;01:28:39;"You, you, you, you"
01:28:39;01:28:40;"I'm not into this"
01:28:40;01:28:41;"What?"
01:28:41;01:28:42;"Oh, come on, Jake"
01:28:42;01:28:43;"Oh, come on"
01:28:43;01:28:46;"Yeah, I'm sorry it's not Calvin Harris featuring Neil Young"
01:28:46;01:28:53;"I'm sorry it's got a drop instead of an Eddie Van Halen solo"
01:28:53;01:28:56;"Jake, this is what the world loves now, man"
01:28:56;01:28:58;"Maybe if the drop was a harmonica"
01:28:58;01:29:00;"I don't even hear Rihanna, that's her?"
01:29:00;01:29:01;"That's her"
01:29:01;01:29:10;"We go fast with the game we play"
01:29:10;01:29:13;"We go fast with the game we play"
01:29:13;01:29:18;"Who knows why it's gotta be this way"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Gotta be this way"
01:29:20;01:29:26;"We say nothing more than we need"
01:29:26;01:29:29;"We need, we need, we need"
01:29:29;01:29:34;"I say your place when we leave"
01:29:34;01:29:37;"Your place when we leave"
01:29:37;01:29:41;"Light break, this ain't what you came for"
01:29:41;01:29:46;"Light break, it's just our time to move"
01:29:46;01:29:51;"And everybody's watching her"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"She's looking at you"
01:29:53;01:29:58;"You, you, you, you"
01:30:18;01:30:21;"Alright, this is what you came for, this is pretty good"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Jake's not impressed, that's pretty good"
01:30:23;01:30:26;"Number four, this is a big moment for me"
01:30:26;01:30:31;"Because I have never had anything to do with a song in the top five"
01:30:31;01:30:38;"Usually I'm just like a bum pressed up against the glass of a TV store"
01:30:38;01:30:41;"Where the TVs are on, like in a movie that takes place in the 60s"
01:30:41;01:30:44;"Just looking in at the top five"
01:30:44;01:30:45;"God, I feel terrible for you"
01:30:45;01:30:47;"Yeah, my life is hell"
01:30:47;01:30:48;"And finally"
01:30:48;01:30:52;"Wait, so what's the highest ranking Vampire Weekend single?"
01:30:52;01:30:53;"Oh see, that's the thing, yeah, because I told you"
01:30:53;01:30:55;"This is the first time I've had anything to do with the top five"
01:30:55;01:30:57;"So you're like, yeah, hasn't there been a Vampire Weekend? No"
01:30:57;01:30:58;"Vampire Weekend"
01:30:58;01:30:59;"I know what it is"
01:30:59;01:31:02;"Well Vampire Weekend, we've always sold albums"
01:31:02;01:31:03;"Yeah"
01:31:03;01:31:06;"So we've had, you know, number one albums"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"But we've never even had a top hundred single in America"
01:31:08;01:31:09;"That's crazy"
01:31:09;01:31:13;"Yeah, it's kind of, that's the difference between the pop machine and the"
01:31:13;01:31:14;"Album oriented world"
01:31:14;01:31:16;"And the AOR world"
01:31:16;01:31:19;"But I don't know if this is entirely true, but I think it is"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"You know, people always talk about top 40"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"Like top 40 is where it's at"
01:31:24;01:31:30;"And Vampire Weekend's only top 40 single in an English speaking country"
01:31:30;01:31:33;"In the Anglosphere is Oxford Comma"
01:31:33;01:31:38;"Which for one shining week in 2008 was number 38 in the UK"
01:31:38;01:31:44;"So that's my only taste of that top 40 life"
01:31:44;01:31:45;"Wow"
01:31:45;01:31:46;"Number 38"
01:31:46;01:31:47;"That's amazing"
01:31:47;01:31:48;"38 special"
01:31:48;01:31:49;"Different worlds"
01:31:49;01:31:52;"So anyway, Hold Up is not my song"
01:31:52;01:31:55;"I'm one of many people who put this together"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"It's Beyonce's song now"
01:31:57;01:32:01;"But at the time of recording this is number 4 in the iTunes store"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"So it's a very special moment for me"
01:32:03;01:32:07;"So obviously you can't say anything bad about this song"
01:32:31;01:32:34;"Hold up, they don't love you like I love you"
01:32:34;01:32:37;"Slow down, they don't love you like I love you"
01:32:37;01:32:40;"Back up, they don't love you like I love you"
01:32:40;01:32:43;"Step down, they don't love you like I love you"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"Can't you see there's no other man above you"
01:32:45;01:32:48;"What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you"
01:32:48;01:32:51;"Hold up, they don't love you like I love you"
01:32:51;01:32:54;"Hold down, they don't love you like I love you"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"Something don't feel right"
01:32:56;01:32:58;"Because it ain't right"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"Especially coming up after midnight"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"I smell your secrets"
01:33:02;01:33:04;"And I'm not too perfect"
01:33:04;01:33:05;"To ever feel this worthless"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"How did it come down to this"
01:33:07;01:33:08;"Scrolling through your call list"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"I don't wanna lose my pride"
01:33:10;01:33:11;"But I'm a fuck me up a bitch"
01:33:11;01:33:13;"You know that I kept it sexy"
01:33:13;01:33:14;"You know I kept it fun"
01:33:14;01:33:15;"There's something that I'm missing"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"Maybe my head for one"
01:33:17;01:33:20;"What's worst, looking jealous or crazy"
01:33:20;01:33:23;"Jealous or crazy"
01:33:23;01:33:26;"Or like being walked all over lately"
01:33:26;01:33:27;"Walked all over lately"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"I'd rather be crazy"
01:33:29;01:33:32;"Hold up, they don't love you like I love you"
01:33:32;01:33:35;"Slow down, they don't love you like I love you"
01:33:35;01:33:38;"Back up, they don't love you like I love you"
01:33:38;01:33:41;"Step down, they don't love you like I love you"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"Can't you see there's no other man above you"
01:33:43;01:33:46;"What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you"
01:33:46;01:33:49;"Hold up, they don't love you like I love you"
01:33:49;01:33:52;"Slow down, they don't love you like I love you"
01:33:52;01:33:53;"Let's imagine for a moment"
01:33:53;01:33:54;"That you never made a name"
01:33:54;01:33:57;"Or yourself a master while they had you labeled as a king"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"Never made it out the case"
01:33:59;01:34:00;"The lot that moving in them streets"
01:34:00;01:34:04;"Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets"
01:34:04;01:34:07;"Would they be down to ride now"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"They used to hide from you, lie to you"
01:34:09;01:34:12;"But y'all know we were made for each other"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"So I find you and hold you down"
01:34:14;01:34:15;"Missing, say"
01:34:15;01:34:18;"Hold up, they don't love you like I love you"
01:34:18;01:34:21;"Slow down, they don't love you like I love you"
01:34:21;01:34:24;"Back up, they don't love you like I love you"
01:34:24;01:34:27;"Step down, they don't love you like I love you"
01:34:27;01:34:30;"Can't you see there's no other man above you"
01:34:30;01:34:33;"What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you"
01:34:33;01:34:36;"Hold up, they don't love you like I love you"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"Slow down, they don't love you like I love you"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"Hey, it's such a shame"
01:34:40;01:34:43;"You let this good love go to waste"
01:34:43;01:34:46;"I always keep the top tip, five star"
01:34:46;01:34:49;"Fancy loving in the car like make that wood, like make that wood"
01:34:49;01:34:50;"Holly like a boulevard"
01:34:50;01:34:53;"What's worse, looking jealous or crazy"
01:34:53;01:34:56;"Jealous and crazy"
01:34:56;01:34:59;"Oh, I like being walked all over lately"
01:34:59;01:35:02;"Walked all over lately, I'd rather be crazy"
01:35:02;01:35:05;"Hold up, they don't love you like I love you"
01:35:05;01:35:08;"Slow down, they don't love you like I love you"
01:35:08;01:35:11;"Back up, they don't love you like I love you"
01:35:11;01:35:14;"Step down, they don't love you like I love you"
01:35:14;01:35:16;"Can't you see there's no other man above you"
01:35:16;01:35:19;"What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you"
01:35:19;01:35:22;"Hold up, they don't love you like I love you"
01:35:22;01:35:25;"Slow down, they don't love you like I love you"
01:35:25;01:35:29;"I hop up off my bed and get my swag on"
01:35:29;01:35:32;"I love you to mirrors, hey, what's up?"
01:35:32;01:35:35;"What's up, what's up, what's up?"
01:35:35;01:35:40;"I hop up off my bed and get my swag on"
01:35:40;01:35:43;"I love you to mirrors, hey, what's up?"
01:35:43;01:35:46;"What's up, what's up, what's up?"
01:35:46;01:35:47;"It's a great song."
01:35:47;01:35:48;"Alright."
01:35:48;01:35:51;"I mean, I don't, it's not like EDM, you know, that's it."
01:35:51;01:35:53;"I mean, like, with the Rihanna and the Calvin Harris."
01:35:53;01:35:55;"This song has a good message."
01:35:55;01:35:56;"What the Calvin Harris did?"
01:35:56;01:35:57;"No, hold up."
01:35:57;01:35:58;"Oh, this does."
01:35:58;01:35:59;"Yeah."
01:35:59;01:36:01;"Right, so people haven't heard this song, we didn't talk about it that much before."
01:36:01;01:36:04;"Apparently, people assume it's directed at Jay-Z."
01:36:04;01:36:05;"Oh, I assume that it's not."
01:36:05;01:36:08;"I mean, you always gotta give artists a little bit of..."
01:36:08;01:36:09;"Leeway?"
01:36:09;01:36:10;"Leeway."
01:36:10;01:36:12;"What do you think it is then?"
01:36:12;01:36:13;"Ah..."
01:36:13;01:36:15;"For me, when I, when I heard this song..."
01:36:15;01:36:19;"Regardless of who it's about, she's letting you in."
01:36:19;01:36:21;"There's a narrative."
01:36:21;01:36:26;"Yeah, but knowing that, like, the popular narrative of the album, it being directed at Jay-Z."
01:36:26;01:36:29;"When I heard this song, I was like, all the more powerful."
01:36:29;01:36:36;"And she's usually so sort of like, cold and sort of, like our earlier guest described her as like cyborg-like."
01:36:36;01:36:37;"This was a cool..."
01:36:37;01:36:39;"Because she's just so talented."
01:36:39;01:36:43;"Yeah, just so like, like that thing of like a pop star is so talented."
01:36:43;01:36:44;"This is vulnerable."
01:36:44;01:36:45;"Exactly."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"Yeah."
01:36:46;01:36:47;"Exactly."
01:36:47;01:36:50;"Instead of like, instead of it being like, perfectly calibrated, this is vulnerable."
01:36:50;01:36:52;"So anyway, I thought it was powerful."
01:36:52;01:36:55;"Thinking it was about Jay-Z, but apparently it's maybe not."
01:36:55;01:36:57;"Has she officially denied it?"
01:36:57;01:36:58;"No, no, no."
01:36:58;01:36:59;"Of course she didn't deny it."
01:36:59;01:37:00;"But that's also what makes this song powerful."
01:37:00;01:37:05;"And that's why, like when we talk about writing and credit and stuff, even the parts that I wrote,"
01:37:05;01:37:08;"it has a much stronger resonance in the context of her album."
01:37:08;01:37:09;"Or how she interpreted it."
01:37:09;01:37:10;"Of course."
01:37:10;01:37:14;"Like, this song wouldn't have fit on Vampire Weekend, Modern Vampire's album."
01:37:14;01:37:16;"Like, it wouldn't have any resonance."
01:37:16;01:37:20;"Here, she took some, she really made it, and with the verses, that has so much more personality."
01:37:20;01:37:23;"Anyway, you also got two songs."
01:37:23;01:37:24;"But what's the positive message?"
01:37:24;01:37:25;"Number four, man."
01:37:25;01:37:26;"Okay, you know what?"
01:37:26;01:37:27;"I spoke too soon."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"It's not a positive message."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"What I meant to say is there's like a strong narrative."
01:37:30;01:37:31;"It was fragile, vulnerable."
01:37:31;01:37:36;"It was, as opposed to any EDM song, it's kind of, you know, a feeling of..."
01:37:36;01:37:38;"We're living, it's Saturday night."
01:37:38;01:37:39;"Exactly."
01:37:39;01:37:44;"Right, well, they're all about real human emotions, but like, this is a universe."
01:37:44;01:37:48;"Everybody's probably had a feeling, like a hold up, they don't love you, like, I love you feeling."
01:37:48;01:37:52;"But we're thinking about ourselves by hearing Beyonce's personal story."
01:37:52;01:37:53;"That's right."
01:37:53;01:37:55;"And that's different than other pop music."
01:37:55;01:37:58;"Number three, also Beyonce, Formation."
01:37:58;01:38:00;"You know this one?"
01:38:00;01:38:01;"Yeah."
01:38:01;01:38:02;"She did this one at the Super Bowl."
01:38:02;01:38:03;"I listened to the record the other day."
01:38:03;01:38:04;"Oh, right, right, right."
01:38:04;01:38:05;"Yes, you've heard it."
01:38:05;01:38:06;"This is a great song."
01:38:06;01:38:07;"Congrats on number four, Ezra."
01:38:07;01:38:08;"Thank you."
01:38:08;01:38:09;"And that's it."
01:38:09;01:38:10;"That's how time works."
01:38:10;01:38:13;"You get your moment at number four, and then you're on to number three."
01:38:18;01:38:29;"Ya'll haters corny with that Illuminati mess Paparazzi catch my fly and my cocky fresh"

01:41:45;01:41:47;"I believe we talked about that."
01:41:47;01:41:48;"I was very confused by that."
01:41:48;01:41:51;"Right. A lot of people carry hot sauce in their bags."
01:41:51;01:41:53;"Like the packets."
01:41:53;01:41:54;"Right."
01:41:54;01:41:56;"Or like a full Tabasco bottle."
01:41:56;01:41:57;"Sometimes."
01:41:57;01:41:59;"So like fire sauce from T-Bowl?"
01:41:59;01:42:01;"We brought hot sauce back from Hawaii."
01:42:01;01:42:03;"Oh, that's true."
01:42:03;01:42:03;"Yeah."
01:42:03;01:42:04;"What kind?"
01:42:04;01:42:07;"From, remember we got that Kauai Juice Company."
01:42:07;01:42:08;"Well, yeah."
01:42:08;01:42:09;"Shout out to the Kauai Juice Company."
01:42:09;01:42:11;"They're making good hot sauce."
01:42:11;01:42:11;"They've been using it?"
01:42:11;01:42:12;"Uh-huh."
01:42:12;01:42:14;"Yeah, yeah, we finished our bottle."
01:42:14;01:42:15;"Wow."
01:42:15;01:42:17;"I got really into ghee on that trip."
01:42:17;01:42:18;"Oh, using ghee to cook."
01:42:18;01:42:19;"Yeah."
01:42:19;01:42:22;"We all went, we just let everybody in on the fact that"
01:42:22;01:42:24;"we all went to Hawaii together once."
01:42:24;01:42:28;"The number two song, the top five is all over the place."
01:42:28;01:42:30;"The number two song is a, I guess you would call it a country"
01:42:30;01:42:32;"song by Florida Georgia Line."
01:42:32;01:42:34;"Have you heard of them, Jake?"
01:42:34;01:42:34;"No."
01:42:34;01:42:37;"People kind of refer to these guys as bro country."
01:42:37;01:42:38;"Florida Georgia Line?"
01:42:38;01:42:41;"Florida Georgia Line."
01:42:41;01:42:42;"Yeah, it's two dudes."
01:42:42;01:42:42;"Okay."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"And they get laid."
01:42:44;01:42:46;"I don't know if it's like, if it's like Bernie Bros or"
01:42:46;01:42:48;"something, people call them bro country."
01:42:48;01:42:51;"I guess because they're probably just like a couple chill"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"dudes who like to crack a brew or something."
01:42:53;01:42:55;"I'm not that familiar with them."
01:42:55;01:42:56;"I know they've had some big hits, but the song is called"
01:42:56;01:43:00;"""Holy"", but it's like H period O period L period Y period."
01:43:00;01:43:01;"H O L Y."
01:43:01;01:43:09;"This is kind of that intersection of like modern pop, little"
01:43:09;01:43:10;"hip-hop, country."
01:44:15;01:44:16;"Get it?"
01:44:16;01:44:17;"High on loving you."
01:44:17;01:44:19;"High on loving you is holy."
01:44:19;01:44:21;"Is this Christian?"
01:44:21;01:44:22;"Uh."
01:44:22;01:44:26;"High on loving you."
01:44:26;01:44:27;"Jake's into it."
01:44:27;01:44:28;"No, I'm not feeling this at all."
01:44:28;01:44:29;"It's terrible."
01:44:29;01:44:32;"I'd rather listen to the Calvin Harris in this."
01:44:32;01:44:35;"This is good Heartland music, man."
01:44:35;01:44:36;"Well, first of all."
01:44:36;01:44:37;"It is the most."
01:44:37;01:44:40;"I don't think this would be labeled as Christian rock, but"
01:44:40;01:44:43;"you know, people have said in the past that the only difference"
01:44:43;01:44:48;"between a Christian song and a secular song is just who the"
01:44:48;01:44:49;"object of affection is."
01:44:49;01:44:50;"Yeah, you know."
01:44:50;01:44:51;"Yeah, sure."
01:44:51;01:44:53;"Isn't that the whole plot of Sister Act?"
01:44:53;01:44:58;"Any song that's a love song, if you replace the girl or the guy"
01:44:58;01:45:03;"that you're singing to with God, then it becomes a religious song."
01:45:03;01:45:04;"Yeah."
01:45:04;01:45:06;"I mean, you can do classy religious music."
01:45:06;01:45:08;"I mean, a lot of the best music of all time is religious music."
01:45:08;01:45:09;"Yeah."
01:45:09;01:45:10;"And pop music."
01:45:10;01:45:11;"J.S. Bob like little."
01:45:11;01:45:12;"Yeah."
01:45:12;01:45:13;"Do you like Mellencamp?"
01:45:13;01:45:14;"No, I'm not a Mellencamp fan."
01:45:14;01:45:15;"Really?"
01:45:16;01:45:17;"Oh, yeah."
01:45:17;01:45:18;"I'm a Mellencamp fan."
01:45:19;01:45:20;"But see, I love wordplay."
01:45:20;01:45:24;"A lot of my favorite lyricists are like, you know, from Q-Tip to"
01:45:24;01:45:27;"Morrissey, I like people who have a way with words."
01:45:27;01:45:29;"Leonard Cohen, Kendrick Lamar."
01:45:29;01:45:31;"I like people who play with language."
01:45:31;01:45:34;"And so, you know, this is like catnip for me."
01:45:34;01:45:36;"Holy, holy, hi, I'm loving you, you know."
01:45:36;01:45:38;"You think that's in there?"
01:45:38;01:45:39;"Yeah, I think it's witty."
01:45:39;01:45:41;"Like, hurts so good?"
01:45:41;01:45:42;"Well, I don't know."
01:45:42;01:45:45;"Because holy, the word holy is spelled H-O-L-Y."
01:45:45;01:45:47;"And then he says, hi, I'm loving you."
01:45:47;01:45:49;"Hi, H-O-L."
01:45:49;01:45:50;"No, I got it."
01:45:50;01:45:51;"I got it."
01:45:51;01:45:52;"Hi, I'm loving you."
01:45:52;01:45:53;"You got it?"
01:45:53;01:45:55;"Wait, are you being serious right now?"
01:45:55;01:45:56;"Yeah, yeah."
01:45:56;01:45:58;"Look me in the eye and tell me you're serious."
01:45:58;01:46:03;"I thought you didn't like the song because you didn't understand the acronym."
01:46:03;01:46:05;"No, I understood it the first time the chorus came in."
01:46:05;01:46:08;"Hi, I'm loving you."
01:46:08;01:46:10;"And you still didn't like it?"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"It's not witty."
01:46:12;01:46:15;"It's not?"
01:46:15;01:46:20;"Speaking of religion, the devil's really testing me today."
01:46:20;01:46:22;"Let's move on to number one."
01:46:22;01:46:23;"We've heard this one before."
01:46:23;01:46:26;"Number one on iTunes right now is Drake."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"Wait, this is number two or one?"
01:46:28;01:46:29;"Well, that was number two."
01:46:29;01:46:30;"Holy was number two."
01:46:30;01:46:34;"Number one this week is Drake featuring Wizkid and Kyla, ""One Dance."""
01:46:34;01:46:36;"We heard this before."
01:46:36;01:46:38;"Wait, is this off the new record that came out?"
01:46:38;01:46:41;"It's off the new record."
01:46:41;01:46:44;"It's cool. It's slow, tropical."
01:46:44;01:46:45;"Oh, wait, we heard this a few weeks ago?"
01:46:45;01:46:46;"Yeah, yeah."
01:46:50;01:46:55;"Holy, holy, hi, I'm loving you."
01:48:28;01:48:33;"I wonder how many people bought this Drake song off iTunes"
01:48:33;01:48:36;"and the Georgia line."
01:48:36;01:48:38;"Florida, Georgia line, excuse me."
01:48:38;01:48:40;"I mean, is that like a totally different demographic?"
01:48:40;01:48:45;"You know, I feel like these days, it's not like back in the day."
01:48:45;01:48:49;"It's like I can totally picture that there's like a guy"
01:48:49;01:48:54;"who's like a commodities trader in Chicago."
01:48:54;01:48:58;"He's like 25 commodities trader and he's like,"
01:48:58;01:48:59;"""I just like good music, man."
01:48:59;01:49:01;"I like, you know, Drake's cool."
01:49:01;01:49:02;"I also like Florida, Georgia line."
01:49:02;01:49:04;"I like music I can have a good time to."""
01:49:04;01:49:08;"So just indiscriminately buying whatever's on the top five?"
01:49:08;01:49:09;"No, no, I'm not saying that."
01:49:09;01:49:13;"I'm saying like Florida, Georgia line is like if in fact"
01:49:13;01:49:16;"they are like bro country and Drake is kind of like bro rap."
01:49:16;01:49:18;"Like it's for guys who want to have a good time"
01:49:18;01:49:21;"but also like wordplay."
01:49:21;01:49:23;"I'm still tripping out on that bro country."
01:49:23;01:49:26;"Bro country is a whole world."
01:49:26;01:49:27;"Is it a new term?"
01:49:27;01:49:28;"Yes."
01:49:28;01:49:29;"Maybe like four or five years."
01:49:29;01:49:31;"Oh, that old?"
01:49:31;01:49:35;"I think it's because like countries always talked about like beer and women."
01:49:35;01:49:39;"But like bro country as I understand it kind of takes some elements of hip hop,"
01:49:39;01:49:41;"like hip hop party songs."
01:49:41;01:49:42;"Right."
01:49:42;01:49:45;"And it's just about like we're just having a good, I don't know."
01:49:45;01:49:51;"Do you think John Mellencamp is like proto bro country?"
01:49:51;01:49:52;"Or Heartland rock?"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"In a way."
01:49:54;01:49:55;"I mean, these guys probably grew up."
01:49:55;01:49:58;"We're also like Garth Brooks and all the '90s guys,"
01:49:58;01:50:01;"Travis Tritt, like the bad boys of country."
01:50:01;01:50:04;"It's pretty much this like contemporary country."
01:50:04;01:50:06;"I think they just added the term bro."
01:50:06;01:50:07;"Yeah, I think you're right."
01:50:07;01:50:08;"They just added the term bro."
01:50:08;01:50:09;"Like it's just country."
01:50:09;01:50:12;"It's like when it's like Mountain Dew becomes Mountain Dew Extreme."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"I don't know why I'm doing Code Red."
01:50:14;01:50:15;"This is a country Code Red."
01:50:15;01:50:18;"Yeah, this is a country Code Red."
01:50:18;01:50:20;"Well, that wraps up the top five."
01:50:20;01:50:25;"Two Beyonce songs, Calvin Harris, Rihanna, Florida Georgia Line, and Drake."
01:50:25;01:50:26;"Not bad."
01:50:36;01:50:39;"I'm still tripping it on the Florida Georgia Line."
01:50:39;01:50:42;"You got to go listen to some Florida Georgia Line after this."
01:50:42;01:50:44;"You know what I'd love to see is like the age,"
01:50:44;01:50:49;"like the median age of each person that bought all of those songs."
01:50:49;01:50:54;"And if like Florida Georgia Line is like in keeping with the rest."
01:50:54;01:50:57;"Too bad those stats aren't available on iTunes."
01:50:57;01:50:58;"I bet they are."
01:50:58;01:51:01;"We're not available, but I'm sure Google or--"
01:51:01;01:51:02;"Oh, I bet Apple has that."
01:51:02;01:51:03;"Apple has that stuff."
01:51:03;01:51:06;"Yeah, maybe we can hack into the mainframe after the show."
01:55:00;01:55:03;"That wraps up season two, episode three of Time Crisis."
01:55:03;01:55:06;"It was wonderful kind of talking about how music comes together."
01:55:06;01:55:08;"We should do another episode like this."
01:55:08;01:55:09;"Thanks to Jake as always."
01:55:09;01:55:14;"Thanks to Ariel Rechad for coming through, breaking down the origins of Usher's climax."
01:55:14;01:55:22;"Thanks to Niki Maillard for calling in and giving us her thoughts about Beyoncé."
01:55:22;01:55:27;"I cannot in good conscience thank Seinfeld 2000, who tried to rickroll me on my own show,"
01:55:27;01:55:31;"so all disrespect to him, but everybody else, we really appreciate it."
01:55:31;01:55:33;"We'll be back in two weeks."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"Take care of each other."
