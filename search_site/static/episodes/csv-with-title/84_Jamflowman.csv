00:01;00:05;"- Time Crisis, 2019."
00:05;00:07;"Enter the 2019 verse."
00:07;00:11;"Today on Time Crisis, Jake and I will be talking about a song"
00:11;00:13;"we should have talked about a long time ago."
00:13;00:17;"This time it's not Joker Man, it's Jam Flow Man."
00:17;00:21;"All that, plus a healthy dose of 1999 nostalgia,"
00:21;00:24;"plus the top five hits on iTunes today."
00:24;00:26;"Welcome to--"
00:26;00:30;"- Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:30;00:33;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beast."
00:33;00:33;"One."
00:33;00:39;"[MUSIC - EZRA KING, ""TIME CRISIS""]"
00:39;00:45;"- They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:45;00:52;"You were a friend who opened me up my rightful chances."
00:52;00:59;"You made my picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:59;01:03;"And so I dealt you the blow."
01:03;01:06;"One of us had to go."
01:06;01:11;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:11;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:16;01:21;"Leave alone me, babe."
01:21;01:24;"Time Crisis, New Year, New Me, 2019."
01:24;01:26;"- It is a new you."
01:26;01:27;"- That's right."
01:27;01:29;"- You're rocking this sweet brown trench coat."
01:29;01:30;"- I got a haircut."
01:30;01:31;"- Good look."
01:31;01:35;"- I have this kind of formal camel jacket."
01:35;01:37;"I just don't have that many occasions to wear it."
01:37;01:39;"- And you're like, I'm going to head down to TC."
01:39;01:40;"- Well, I was kind of wearing it all day."
01:40;01:43;"I kind of like to stick to a jacket for the whole day."
01:43;01:45;"- Were you doing things around town?"
01:45;01:48;"Were you running into spots and sporting the jacket?"
01:48;01:50;"- I went to a coffee bean with this look."
01:50;01:52;"- Did you post up for a while or just get a cup to go?"
01:52;01:53;"- Just got a cup to go."
01:53;01:56;"I was walking around, I was starting my stuff."
01:56;01:56;"I had lunch."
01:56;01:57;"- Solo?"
01:57;01:58;"- Yeah, I had a solo lunch."
01:58;02:00;"- With coat on."
02:00;02:01;"- Yeah."
02:01;02:01;"- That's a tight look."
02:01;02:04;"- Yeah, it's nice that it's finally cool enough in LA"
02:04;02:05;"to wear a proper jacket."
02:05;02:06;"- Yep."
02:06;02:08;"- But you still wear just like a t-shirt under it"
02:08;02:09;"'cause it's not that cold."
02:09;02:10;"- Yeah."
02:10;02:12;"- Can you believe it's 2019, man?"
02:12;02:12;"- Far out, huh?"
02:12;02:14;"- Next year's going to be 2020."
02:14;02:15;"- Looking forward to that."
02:15;02:17;"- Maybe that's when things will get back on track."
02:17;02:19;"I've seen somebody make that point before."
02:19;02:23;"Part of the reason that the last 19 years have been so weird"
02:23;02:26;"is because we weren't in a real decade."
02:26;02:27;"Once we're back in the 20s, we're like,"
02:27;02:29;"""Okay, we have to reset."
02:29;02:30;"Now we're in a decade."""
02:30;02:33;"- Yeah, nothing weird ever happens during the 20s"
02:33;02:34;"or the turning over of the next century."
02:34;02:35;"- Amen."
02:35;02:38;"- Like 1920 to 2000, like smooth sailing."
02:38;02:39;"(laughing)"
02:39;02:41;"- Say what you will about a world war,"
02:41;02:42;"but at least people are hashing it out."
02:42;02:45;"Not all this passive aggressive social media bullshit."
02:45;02:47;"No, you're right, things get bad."
02:47;02:48;"- Things can get dicey."
02:48;02:49;"- Things can get dicey, but--"
02:49;02:51;"- I'm really looking forward to the 2020 presidential race."
02:51;02:53;"That's just going to be fun."
02:53;02:54;"- Oh yeah, it's already fun."
02:54;02:55;"- It's not going to be draining or anything."
02:55;02:58;"- It's already fun seeing people debate Beto"
02:58;02:59;"and Elizabeth Warren."
02:59;03:01;"We got enough time."
03:01;03:03;"We also just don't even learn our lessons, right?"
03:03;03:05;"- First episode of TC 2019,"
03:05;03:06;"we're going to do a full breakdown"
03:06;03:08;"of the Democratic nominees."
03:08;03:09;"- Guys, it's 2019."
03:09;03:11;"That means--"
03:11;03:13;"- Election is 18 months away."
03:13;03:15;"- Our election coverage starts now."
03:15;03:20;"- You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
03:20;03:23;"- It's also funny, I feel like every time"
03:23;03:25;"you're like the year before primary,"
03:25;03:27;"I guess the primaries would be this year."
03:27;03:28;"- No, like a year from now, January."
03:28;03:30;"- The primaries would be in January?"
03:30;03:31;"- Yeah, next year."
03:31;03:32;"- So things will get pretty heated"
03:32;03:33;"towards the end of this year."
03:33;03:35;"I guess we're not that far from all this nonsense."
03:35;03:36;"- Well, I think we are."
03:36;03:38;"I mean, we're a full year from--"
03:38;03:39;"- Yeah, but it's like,"
03:39;03:41;"things got to get pretty hot in the fall"
03:41;03:43;"before the primary winter."
03:43;03:44;"Oh man."

04:35;04:40;"- How you doing, man?"
04:40;04:41;"- I'm good, man."
04:41;04:44;"I didn't want to talk about all that stuff."
04:44;04:46;"I didn't, look man, I'll support whoever can win."
04:46;04:47;"- Yeah. - But I'm good."
04:47;04:48;"It's 2019."
04:48;04:50;"- You're turning 35 this year."
04:50;04:52;"- Oh yeah, I'll turn 35 this April."
04:52;04:54;"- I was just noticing it's on the sheet here."
04:54;04:56;"It's time crisis episode 84."
04:56;04:58;"- I mean, I'm an 84 guy."
04:58;04:59;"Do you remember turning 35?"
04:59;05:01;"- Yeah, I moved to LA then."
05:01;05:02;"- Oh, really? - Yeah."
05:02;05:05;"In fact, I remember moving here at age 35"
05:05;05:06;"and staying with my cousin,"
05:06;05:08;"and he was like, ""How old are you, like 28?"""
05:08;05:10;"And I was like, ""No, I'm 35."""
05:10;05:14;"He's like, ""Oh, oh, that's like a real age."""
05:14;05:15;"- Right."
05:15;05:17;"- And then I remember like the first few months I was here,"
05:17;05:19;"you hit me up, you were in town."
05:19;05:22;"You were staying at this like little hotel above"
05:22;05:24;"that place El Chavo, remember that?"
05:24;05:26;"- Oh yeah, the super rent, doesn't exist anymore."
05:26;05:28;"- Yeah, that Mexican restaurant that closed."
05:28;05:30;"And then I remember we were like driving"
05:30;05:33;"in a car out to the beach, out of Santa Monica."
05:33;05:36;"- Oh, we went to that crazy, fancy beach club?"
05:36;05:37;"- Yeah, and you were like, ""How old are you?"""
05:37;05:38;"And I was like, ""35."""
05:38;05:40;"And you're like, ""You got like five years."""
05:40;05:41;"- Yeah."
05:41;05:42;"- And I was like, ""What does that mean?"""
05:42;05:45;"- And I just like, I just turned the radio up."
05:45;05:46;"(laughing)"
05:46;05:47;"You got five."
05:47;05:49;"- Then we just sat there in silence for 20 minutes."
05:49;05:52;"♪ You got five years ♪"
05:52;05:54;"♪ Is that all you got, five years ♪"
05:54;05:55;"I mean, I understand what you meant."
05:55;05:58;"You're like, you know, get your act together."
05:58;06:00;"- No, I was saying the opposite of your cousin a little bit."
06:00;06:01;"Well, maybe. - Exactly."
06:01;06:04;"- Like some people would say 35, you're five years late."
06:04;06:05;"- Yeah, you should have your act together."
06:05;06:07;"You should have like a stable life"
06:07;06:08;"and like a game plan together."
06:08;06:10;"- I would actually say that these days,"
06:10;06:13;"the impression that I get from our culture"
06:13;06:14;"is that the values of when you're supposed"
06:14;06:18;"to do certain things in life shift all the time."
06:18;06:18;"- Sure."
06:18;06:20;"- You know, it used to be you were kinda,"
06:20;06:22;"in the Jewish tradition, you're an adult at 13."
06:22;06:24;"(laughing)"
06:24;06:25;"Seems very ancient."
06:25;06:27;"And then I think it was like widely accepted"
06:27;06:29;"when you're older, 18, you're an adult."
06:29;06:30;"- Yeah."
06:30;06:30;"- And I think now--"
06:30;06:32;"- Having kids when you're like 22."
06:32;06:35;"- Yeah, by then your adulthood shifts into like adult prime."
06:35;06:36;"- Yeah."
06:36;06:38;"- Now I think the impression that I get,"
06:38;06:41;"and you know, for real reasons, real socioeconomic reasons,"
06:41;06:44;"and then also maybe just like some weird,"
06:44;06:46;"not so good reasons, I kinda get the impression"
06:46;06:48;"that it's like adulthood starts more around 30."
06:48;06:51;"I've noticed like people can get away with playing the like,"
06:51;06:52;"I'm not really an adult yet."
06:52;06:55;"- I think for like the college set, that's true."
06:55;06:56;"- Yeah."
06:56;06:57;"- People that go to college."
06:57;06:58;"- That's true."
06:58;06:59;"- 'Cause if you're just like some dude"
06:59;07:01;"that's like working at Jiffy Lube and you're 24"
07:01;07:03;"and you're married and you have a kid, then it's like--"
07:03;07:03;"- Right, yeah, you can--"
07:03;07:05;"- That's like some like mid 20th century--"
07:05;07:08;"- You can picture like some like upper middle class,"
07:08;07:10;"collegiate type who's just kinda living in an apartment"
07:10;07:13;"with their friends, they're like 29,"
07:13;07:14;"just figuring it all out."
07:14;07:16;"They're at the Jiffy Lube like dealing with like"
07:16;07:19;"the hardcore 23 year old with like two kids."
07:19;07:20;"- Yeah."
07:20;07:20;"- And they're just being like--"
07:20;07:23;"- I'm sold on this like weird battery."
07:23;07:25;"- Or I was also just picturing them assuming"
07:25;07:26;"that the guy's like much older than them"
07:26;07:27;"and just being like, oh yeah,"
07:27;07:29;"I don't know anything about this stuff."
07:29;07:31;"I've never actually dealt with this before."
07:31;07:33;"Like, you know, I've driven my parents' car for a while"
07:33;07:35;"and the guy's like, looks at their driver's license"
07:35;07:37;"and he's like, sir, you're six years older than me."
07:37;07:39;"I've been a father for three years."
07:39;07:43;"You pull up here, P to Chip rappers on the floor a year."
07:43;07:44;"Jetta."
07:44;07:47;"But anyway, I think roughly like now people can kinda play"
07:47;07:50;"the extended adolescence up until around 30."
07:50;07:50;"- Right."
07:50;07:53;"- And then it's like 30 is like you enter the 36 chambers"
07:53;07:55;"and then 40 is like--"
07:55;07:56;"- All right, come on, bro."
07:56;07:58;"- Listen, you were a kid until 30."
07:58;07:59;"- You had your time in the sun."
07:59;08:01;"- And then we gave you 10 years to really get"
08:01;08:02;"your (beep) together."
08:02;08:04;"Now you're four, I can't help you."
08:04;08:05;"- That ship has sailed."
08:05;08:08;"- It's like a solid 25 years later than it used to be,"
08:08;08:11;"which maybe is a good thing, maybe not, I don't know."
08:11;08:12;"- Wouldn't it be crazy if we just kept going?"
08:12;08:14;"I mean, I guess like if like people that come"
08:14;08:17;"from really wealthy families, like I know some dudes"
08:17;08:20;"that live up in like Ventura, like in like Montecito area."
08:20;08:20;"- Yeah."
08:20;08:22;"- They're just like rich dudes that are like 50."
08:22;08:24;"Like the last 25 years has just been like,"
08:24;08:27;"oh, I'm dating this chick and like, I don't know."
08:27;08:27;"- Oh, totally."
08:27;08:29;"- Just like surfing."
08:29;08:31;"- Yeah, no, no, there's a lot of people like that."
08:31;08:32;"Who are you?"
08:32;08:32;"Like what?"
08:32;08:35;"- Yeah, these lines are only gonna get more and more blurred."
08:35;08:36;"- Yeah."
08:36;08:39;"- I think especially with like the environmental apocalypse"
08:39;08:41;"and all of this stuff."
08:41;08:42;"I remember my mom, my mom said,"
08:42;08:43;"well, that's a whole other story."
08:43;08:44;"- All this stuff."
08:44;08:46;"- I remember my mom said something once to me,"
08:46;08:50;"'cause she's from more of like a crunchy hippie generation"
08:50;08:53;"or baby boomers who came of age in the 60s."
08:53;08:54;"- Sure."
08:54;08:56;"- We're kind of the first generation to be interested"
08:56;08:59;"in health food and things that maybe today"
08:59;09:00;"would be called wellness or something."
09:00;09:01;"- How old is your mom?"
09:01;09:04;"- She was born in 1949."
09:04;09:04;"So she's--"
09:04;09:06;"- Turned 70 this year."
09:06;09:08;"- Yeah, she's 69, she'll turn 70 this year."
09:08;09:11;"And I remember like being at my grandma's nursing home"
09:11;09:13;"where you have like people who were born more like"
09:13;09:16;"turn of the century or maybe a little bit later."
09:16;09:16;"- Yeah."
09:16;09:18;"- And you know, you can picture like a typical"
09:18;09:21;"American nursing home and what the vibe is"
09:21;09:23;"and what the food is like and what the look is."
09:23;09:24;"I just remember my mom saying something"
09:24;09:25;"that always like stuck with me where she was like,"
09:25;09:27;"I wonder what my generation's version of this"
09:27;09:28;"is gonna look like."
09:28;09:31;"Because you know, people like my grandma"
09:31;09:34;"who were like immigrants from the old world"
09:34;09:35;"and then probably like, you know,"
09:35;09:37;"grew up in like weird tenement housing"
09:37;09:40;"and were just like super happy to move to like a whack suburb."
09:40;09:42;"You know, if they're in like a clean,"
09:42;09:46;"antiseptic nursing home, they probably were like--"
09:46;09:47;"- Cool."
09:47;09:47;"- This is cool."
09:47;09:48;"- Yeah."
09:48;09:50;"- But then you picture more like the baby boomer generation."
09:50;09:52;"You know, they might even already have too many"
09:52;09:55;"negative associations with nursing homes, understandably."
09:55;09:56;"- Right."
09:56;09:57;"- That doesn't exactly have a great reputation."
09:57;09:59;"But pretty soon they're gonna have to start opening"
09:59;10:03;"ones that have good, healthy, organic food."
10:03;10:04;"- That aren't so like industrialized."
10:04;10:05;"- Yeah."
10:05;10:06;"- That are like more like boutique."
10:06;10:08;"- Yeah, like where's Bob Weir gonna go?"
10:08;10:09;"- That's a great question, man."
10:09;10:11;"- I mean, he's super paid, so he'll probably have--"
10:11;10:12;"- Like private in-home stuff."
10:12;10:14;"- Yeah, he could have private, that's kind of,"
10:14;10:15;"I don't wanna--"
10:15;10:16;"(laughing)"
10:16;10:17;"- This is so funny."
10:17;10:18;"- I'm sorry, Bob, I don't wanna,"
10:18;10:19;"you're still very young."
10:19;10:21;"But I'm just saying like that type of person,"
10:21;10:24;"what's it gonna look like for the middle class?"
10:24;10:26;"'Cause remember, there still is a middle class"
10:26;10:27;"for that generation."
10:27;10:28;"- Sure."
10:28;10:30;"- What's like the middle class baby boomer generation"
10:30;10:31;"nursing home gonna look like?"
10:31;10:33;"They're not gonna happily move into what their parents"
10:33;10:34;"moved into."
10:34;10:35;"And then you go even one step further,"
10:35;10:37;"what's the millennial old age gonna look like?"
10:37;10:40;"I think you're gonna have way more people without kids."
10:40;10:40;"- Right."
10:40;10:43;"- I can totally picture the New York Times style article"
10:43;10:45;"like in 30 years."
10:45;10:45;"- Oh my God, dude."
10:45;10:49;"- That's just about like aging 70 year old hipsters."
10:49;10:52;"It's like, we're a crew of 10 people, we never had kids,"
10:52;10:55;"but like obviously we're not ashamed about that."
10:55;10:57;"Like some, what is this, 100 years ago?"
10:57;11:01;"And we travel and we live in a house together in Greece"
11:01;11:03;"half the year and the other half of the year,"
11:03;11:06;"we live in Brooklyn and you know like--"
11:06;11:08;"- Right, and like between that 10 and then they've hired"
11:08;11:10;"like four full-time nurses."
11:10;11:11;"- Yeah, maybe they're like 80."
11:11;11:14;"And they'd be like, some of us have like mobility issues"
11:14;11:17;"so we can't actually walk to the blue bottle."
11:17;11:20;"But actually on the ground floor, we have like,"
11:20;11:24;"somebody's nephew comes and kind of like every morning"
11:24;11:27;"he posts up, only for two hours, but he just kind of like"
11:27;11:30;"runs like a blue bottle coffee like in the corner."
11:30;11:31;"- Honestly, sounds dope."
11:31;11:33;"- Yeah, I think we just hit on something."
11:33;11:35;"- I mean, and that model would apply for people"
11:35;11:37;"that have kids or don't have kids."
11:37;11:38;"- Yeah, because kids are--"
11:38;11:40;"- God knows your grown kids are not gonna be"
11:40;11:41;"taking care of you."
11:41;11:43;"- Yeah, we should just totally skip whatever."
11:43;11:44;"Baby boomers, they're gonna figure out"
11:44;11:45;"their own nursing homes."
11:45;11:47;"But we get in on the ground floor now"
11:47;11:48;"with millennial nursing homes."
11:48;11:49;"- I like this."
11:49;11:52;"We've got about a, what, a 40 year head start?"
11:52;11:54;"- The nursing home definitely has to have an app."
11:54;11:56;"- I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves."
11:56;11:58;"- When you go to sleep at 8 p.m.,"
11:58;12:01;"you could use the app to pre-order your coffee"
12:01;12:03;"from the temporary blue bottle."
12:03;12:05;"And then you roll down, you see everybody."
12:05;12:06;"I mean, yeah, it could be a good thing."

13:19;13:22;"We're coming up on the anniversary of a lot of stuff."
13:22;13:24;"'Cause 1999 was kind of a major year."
13:24;13:25;"- I graduated college."
13:25;13:26;"- Oh really? - Yep."
13:26;13:28;"- Wow, was there a lot of talk at your graduation"
13:28;13:31;"about like, you are entering the workforce"
13:31;13:32;"in a new millennium."
13:32;13:33;"- I'm sure."
13:33;13:36;"- By this time next year, a century will have passed."
13:36;13:38;"It'll be the year 2000."
13:38;13:42;"- The World Wide Web, the superhighway of information"
13:42;13:46;"will create unprecedented opportunities for all of you."
13:46;13:49;"But I implore you students to meet the World Wide Web"
13:49;13:52;"head on, for you have what it takes."
13:52;13:55;"- There's such a specific cadence for graduation speeches."
13:55;13:58;"I wonder, has anybody ever done like a breakdown"
13:58;14:00;"of like the different classic cadences?"
14:00;14:01;"They're like slightly different from each other."
14:01;14:03;"Like newscasters like,"
14:03;14:06;"early this morning in Brooklyn a fire alarmed."
14:06;14:06;"No, no, no."
14:06;14:08;"And then like graduation speech always like,"
14:08;14:11;"but I am done assuring you students to not done,"
14:11;14:15;"but to stop, listen and look into the future"
14:15;14:16;"with eyes wide open."
14:16;14:21;"For you to blah, blah, blah, wash, rinse, repeat."
14:21;14:22;"It's slower."
14:22;14:25;"I wonder if you'll get asked to do a speech somewhere"
14:25;14:27;"in like maybe 10 years."
14:27;14:29;"- Never have, it seems like a--"
14:29;14:30;"- I think you're too young."
14:30;14:33;"I can see you in like 10 years being asked by someplace."
14:33;14:34;"- My high school."
14:34;14:35;"- Something."
14:35;14:37;"- College, seems like low reward."
14:37;14:38;"- Yeah."
14:38;14:40;"- Like gotta spend all this time to write a speech"
14:40;14:41;"and then what?"
14:41;14:42;"- And you have to make sure there's,"
14:42;14:44;"it's kind of anodyne."
14:44;14:46;"'Cause everyone's just gonna get pissed off."
14:46;14:46;"- Right, if you tell like--"
14:46;14:48;"- Either the students or the teacher,"
14:48;14:49;"someone's gonna get."
14:49;14:50;"- Yeah."
14:50;14:52;"But anyways, 1999, a lot happened."
14:52;14:56;"The Sopranos first aired 20 years ago this week."
14:56;14:57;"That's wild."
14:57;14:59;"We were just talking about the Sopranos late last year."
14:59;15:01;"There was also Woodstock '99."
15:01;15:01;"- That's rough."
15:01;15:02;"- Woodstock's in the air"
15:02;15:05;"because Woodstock '99 is 20 years ago"
15:05;15:08;"and Woodstock, the original is 50 years ago."
15:08;15:09;"- All these anniversaries."
15:09;15:11;"- I remember like, yeah, like 2013,"
15:11;15:14;"it was like 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination."
15:14;15:16;"We're just kind of like live in the 60s."
15:16;15:19;"2017, it was like summer of love."
15:19;15:20;"- Right."
15:20;15:22;"- And like the 50th anniversary of the Grateful Dead"
15:22;15:24;"and now like this summer in LA,"
15:24;15:26;"we'll get like the 50th anniversary"
15:26;15:27;"of like the Manson murders."
15:27;15:31;"50th, Woodstock, we'll get 50th of Altamont,"
15:31;15:31;"December of--"
15:31;15:32;"- Man on the Moon?"
15:32;15:34;"- Yeah, that's also, that's July."
15:34;15:36;"So this will be a huge anniversary year."
15:36;15:40;"Obviously, you can't let an anniversary pass"
15:40;15:41;"without cashing in a little bit."
15:41;15:42;"So this summer--"
15:42;15:43;"- That's fair."
15:43;15:45;"- On the 50th anniversary of Woodstock,"
15:45;15:46;"there are currently not one,"
15:46;15:50;"but two 50th anniversary festivals in production."
15:50;15:52;"So first you got the Beth El Woods"
15:52;15:54;"Music and Culture Festival,"
15:54;15:56;"which takes place at the original Woodstock venue"
15:56;16:00;"from August 16th to 18th, put on by Live Nation."
16:00;16:02;"I just sent a text to my management,"
16:02;16:04;"how come we haven't been invited to any of these?"
16:04;16:05;"Not that we'd wanna go."
16:05;16:06;"- Yeah, but you gotta get the invite."
16:06;16:08;"- It'd be nice to be invited."
16:08;16:11;"And then the second is Michael Lang's festival,"
16:11;16:12;"which is out in Watkins Glen."
16:12;16:13;"- Oh, the same weekend."
16:13;16:15;"- Exact same weekend."
16:15;16:16;"- Wow, they're going head to head, that's tough."
16:16;16:19;"- So Michael Lang is the co-creator"
16:19;16:21;"of the original Woodstock."
16:21;16:22;"- Wow."
16:22;16:25;"- So he says, ""While the original site in Beth El"
16:25;16:26;"""remains close to our hearts,"
16:26;16:27;"""it no longer has the capacity"
16:27;16:29;"""to hold a real Woodstock festival."
16:29;16:30;"""I'm delighted that Beth El Woods is doing events"
16:30;16:31;"""in the coming year to celebrate"
16:31;16:34;"""what we brought to life in 1969."""
16:34;16:35;"So he's being kind of like, trying to be polite."
16:35;16:36;"- Yeah."
16:36;16:37;"- 'Cause now there's this kind of like,"
16:37;16:39;"cultural heritage center with like,"
16:39;16:40;"an amphitheater on the site."
16:40;16:41;"- Oh, really?"
16:41;16:42;"- So he's kind of being like, ""That's cute."
16:42;16:43;"""You guys do your little thing."""
16:43;16:45;"- And it's like, corporate now, too."
16:45;16:46;"- Yeah, and he's being like,"
16:46;16:48;"""But you cannot have a real Woodstock festival."""
16:48;16:50;"So he's doing maybe something bigger."
16:50;16:52;"He's already booked 40 acts to appear."
16:52;16:53;"And Watkins Glen is kind of famous,"
16:53;16:55;"like there's some dead shows out there."
16:55;16:58;"That's where Phish was gonna do their festival"
16:58;17:01;"this past summer, Curveball, that got canceled."
17:01;17:04;"So Watkins Glen has a kind of crunchy heritage."
17:04;17:05;"- Okay, but no acts announced yet."
17:05;17:06;"- I guess neither--"
17:06;17:07;"- So nothing's been announced."
17:07;17:08;"- Nope, sort of."
17:08;17:09;"- So it's sort of like--"
17:09;17:10;"- We don't know which one we should go to."
17:10;17:12;"Well, which one of these sounds more official,"
17:12;17:13;"or do we have to wait for the lineup?"
17:13;17:15;"- I mean, I'm gonna go with the OG."
17:15;17:16;"- Meaning Michael Lang?"
17:16;17:17;"- Yeah, Michael Lang."
17:17;17:20;"But obviously, that's contingent on lineup."
17:20;17:23;"But Michael Lang's like, ""We got Foo Fighters,"
17:23;17:27;"""Limp Bizkit, we're doing a Cypress Hill reunion."""
17:27;17:29;"You know, it's sort of like, well."
17:29;17:31;"- I mean, Cypress Hill reunion would fit in."
17:31;17:32;"- That'd be kinda tight."
17:32;17:33;"- That'd be tight."
17:33;17:34;"I don't think they ever broke up."
17:34;17:36;"- Oh yeah, I don't know where I pulled that out of."
17:36;17:39;"- Cypress Hill's not performing together in over six months."
17:39;17:40;"We're bringing them back together."
17:40;17:43;"Clearly one of these is gonna be like,"
17:43;17:45;"try to do a mix of old and new."
17:45;17:46;"- So it's just a grab bag."
17:46;17:49;"- Yeah, I mean, you can totally picture one that's like,"
17:49;17:51;"and I mean, we've played at festivals like this"
17:51;17:53;"a little bit, that's like, ""With your headliners,"
17:53;17:58;"""Bob Dylan, Demi Lovato, and Imagine Dragons."""
17:58;17:59;"That's like super real."
17:59;18:02;"- That would be just like all over the place."
18:02;18:04;"- That's more or less happened before, but whatever."
18:04;18:06;"I guess for a certain type of person, it's cool."
18:06;18:07;"But it'd be cool if one of them,"
18:07;18:09;"and hopefully it's Michael Langs,"
18:09;18:10;"was just like, ""You know what?"
18:10;18:11;"""This moment may have passed."
18:11;18:13;"""People moved on to other types of music."
18:13;18:15;"""It's cool, but you know, that's our moment."
18:15;18:17;"""We're still alive, and we wanna put on something"
18:17;18:19;"""that celebrates the music of that era,"
18:19;18:20;"""and we're gonna get all the old heads."""
18:20;18:24;"And like, we're basically saying, ""Call in all old hippies."""
18:24;18:25;"So a little bit like a Grateful Dead concert,"
18:25;18:28;"but it's just like, if you're an OG hippie,"
18:28;18:29;"you're gonna feel right at home here."
18:29;18:31;"There's gonna be fun stuff for you to do."
18:31;18:33;"There's gonna be music that you like."
18:33;18:34;"We're not trying to mix it up too much,"
18:34;18:35;"and if anybody younger is interested,"
18:35;18:36;"you know, you come through too."
18:36;18:37;"- You're welcome."
18:37;18:39;"- But just like, we're getting as many people"
18:39;18:41;"who played the original as possible,"
18:41;18:43;"and we're gonna get music that's got a little bit"
18:43;18:45;"of a hippie-dippie, crunchy vibe,"
18:45;18:48;"and we wanna make 70-year-old plus hippies feel at home."
18:48;18:49;"I would rather go to that one."
18:49;18:51;"- Yeah, it's not gonna be as marquee."
18:51;18:54;"You're gonna get bluegrass bands playing,"
18:54;18:57;"and maybe like a Rufus Wainwright or something,"
18:57;18:58;"which would be dope."
18:58;18:59;"- Why not?"
18:59;19:01;"- You know, no real hard rock or hip hop."
19:01;19:02;"- Are they gonna let any EDM in?"
19:02;19:03;"- Oh, hell no."
19:03;19:05;"- What about like, that kind of like--"
19:05;19:06;"- Maybe like Moby."
19:06;19:07;"- Psytrance?"
19:07;19:08;"Moby, yeah, I don't know."
19:08;19:09;"- Moby's kinda chill."
19:09;19:12;"- Yeah, but now you're opening up the floodgates."
19:12;19:13;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
19:13;19:14;"- Why's Moby allowed?"
19:14;19:16;"- He's like a vegan, he's mellow."
19:16;19:18;"- I mean, he can come as an attendee."
19:18;19:20;"I'm not saying that."
19:20;19:24;"- Oh, he's welcome to purchase a ticket at full price."
19:24;19:26;"- All are welcome."
19:26;19:27;"- He's on me."

21:07;21:11;"- You know who might play, dude?"
21:11;21:12;"Twiddle."
21:12;21:13;"- That'd be tight."
21:13;21:15;"Are we finally gonna talk about Twiddle?"
21:15;21:16;"- Let's do it."
21:16;21:17;"- I think it's time."
21:17;21:20;"There is a song that Jake and I have been talking about"
21:20;21:20;"for a long time."
21:20;21:22;"Have we actually mentioned it on the show before?"
21:22;21:24;"- Yeah, I think we've like played part of it once"
21:24;21:26;"on the show once and then someone texted me,"
21:26;21:29;"like a friend of mine was like, ""What is this music?"""
21:29;21:33;"- So Jake, you put me onto this song."
21:33;21:35;"And look, we gotta be delicate talking about this"
21:35;21:38;"because we first heard about this song"
21:38;21:40;"in the context of people being hard on."
21:40;21:43;"- Yeah, I mean, I'm not a Twiddle expert by any stretch."
21:43;21:46;"I heard about it from John Nixon,"
21:46;21:49;"who is the other guitarist in Richard Pictures."
21:49;21:51;"And he's much more up like kind of current"
21:51;21:53;"with like jam bands."
21:53;21:53;"- The jam world, yeah."
21:53;21:56;"- And so he was up on some boards, like chat rooms"
21:56;21:58;"or whatever, reading people's comments"
21:58;22:00;"about different jam bands."
22:00;22:03;"And I guess Twiddle is like kind of a constant source"
22:03;22:05;"of confrontation on that board"
22:05;22:08;"'cause there's obviously a huge devoted fan base,"
22:08;22:09;"but they also got a lot of grief"
22:09;22:11;"from like some of the jam band community."
22:11;22:14;"- I've seen this as well on some Instagram accounts,"
22:14;22:16;"people, you know, I think I showed you one"
22:16;22:18;"that came up my Instagram Explorer"
22:18;22:19;"that was a pyramid of jam bands"
22:19;22:21;"where obviously the Grateful Dead was at the top."
22:21;22:22;"- Sure."
22:22;22:24;"- And then the bottom was in big letters Twiddle."
22:24;22:25;"- Right."
22:25;22:26;"- And just some mean spirited jokes."
22:26;22:27;"- Right."
22:27;22:28;"- Yeah, so like you said,"
22:28;22:30;"clearly they have a devoted fan base,"
22:30;22:31;"people are into them,"
22:31;22:34;"but other jam fans who are maybe into Fish or the Dead"
22:34;22:37;"like to take some pot shots at Twiddle."
22:37;22:41;"- As a casual fan, like obviously there's the Dead and Fish"
22:41;22:45;"who are like kind of like uncontested the OGs"
22:45;22:47;"and like the giants of the genre."
22:47;22:47;"- Right."
22:47;22:49;"- It's like Beatles and Stones."
22:49;22:49;"- Yeah."
22:49;22:51;"- After that, it's just like,"
22:51;22:52;"at least from my perception,"
22:52;22:55;"it's just like a vast sea."
22:55;22:56;"(laughing)"
22:56;22:59;"And like widespread panic,"
22:59;23:02;"like I can't split hairs between Twiddle"
23:02;23:03;"and widespread panic."
23:03;23:04;"- Okay, I will say this though."
23:04;23:05;"- I will say this, there's somebody listening right now"
23:05;23:07;"who just like had a heart attack."
23:07;23:09;"Did this dude really say he can't split hairs"
23:09;23:13;"between widespread mother (beep) panic and Twiddle?"
23:13;23:14;"- I'll say this."
23:14;23:15;"- Yeah."
23:15;23:17;"- I don't know one widespread original song."
23:17;23:19;"- Oh, I sent you one recently."
23:19;23:21;"- That's true, it did not connect."
23:21;23:24;"(laughing)"
23:24;23:26;"You texted me this song and you were like,"
23:26;23:27;"dude, what do you think of this?"
23:27;23:29;"Like exclamation point, question mark."
23:29;23:30;"And then I listened to it and I was like,"
23:30;23:32;"yeah, that's cool, man."
23:32;23:33;"- It's kind of a good song."
23:33;23:34;"I like it."
23:34;23:35;"- We could dive into that too,"
23:35;23:36;"but just to finish the point."
23:36;23:37;"- Okay, we'll play that later."
23:37;23:40;"- So I was just like, Twiddle has a song called Jamflow Man"
23:40;23:43;"that we started listening to at Richard Pictures practice"
23:43;23:46;"and honestly just delighted the room."
23:46;23:50;"I mean, we're laughing at it and with it."
23:50;23:51;"I mean, it's a fun song."
23:51;23:55;"It's like, I think the song is done with a sense of humor."
23:55;23:56;"- I think so too."
23:56;23:57;"- It's like, it's funny."
23:57;23:59;"- I think it's done with a slight sense of humor."
23:59;24:03;"And actually after you sent me a documentary about Twiddle."
24:03;24:04;"- I've not watched the whole thing, but I'm."
24:04;24:06;"- I watched the first 15."
24:06;24:09;"- And first of all, as soon as you watch it,"
24:09;24:12;"you can tell these guys are cutups."
24:12;24:14;"They're like razzing on each other."
24:14;24:15;"They're cracking a lot of jokes."
24:15;24:17;"So I think they don't come across"
24:17;24:20;"as like dour, hyper serious guys."
24:20;24:20;"- No."
24:20;24:21;"- At all."
24:21;24:22;"They're having fun, which I mean,"
24:22;24:25;"as a jam man kind of needs to."
24:25;24:28;"A dour jam band is kind of brutal."
24:28;24:30;"But anyway, this song Jamflow Man,"
24:30;24:33;"we've uncovered we're both like interested in the jam scene,"
24:33;24:34;"but not like deep."
24:34;24:36;"And I think what we've uncovered is that"
24:36;24:39;"within the jam universe, like we said,"
24:39;24:42;"Grateful Dead is up top, Fish are one level below,"
24:42;24:44;"and then it's a free for all."
24:44;24:45;"But even within that free for all,"
24:45;24:48;"Twiddle gets a lot of (beep)"
24:48;24:50;"and then within the Twiddle catalog,"
24:50;24:52;"the song Jamflow Man gets a lot of (beep)."
24:52;24:54;"So in some ways the song Jamflow Man"
24:54;24:58;"is like the punching bag for a lot of mean spirited people"
24:58;24:59;"in the jam community,"
24:59;25:00;"which I can't even believe I'm saying that"
25:00;25:05;"because the jam band community should be like chill."
25:05;25:07;"- Maybe it's one of those things where it's like,"
25:07;25:09;"think about these songs that kind of like came back,"
25:09;25:12;"ironically, like I feel like for my generation,"
25:12;25:13;"speaking of Sopranos,"
25:13;25:14;"it was a little bit like don't stop believing."
25:14;25:17;"Like people would be like, this song is so kind of corny."
25:17;25:19;"Then after a while people started to be like,"
25:19;25:20;"- Song's good."
25:20;25:22;"- It's just a good song."
25:22;25:23;"Maybe even Toto Africa,"
25:23;25:25;"like there are all these like millennials being like,"
25:25;25:28;"Toto Africa, it's funny, cover Toto Africa."
25:28;25:30;"And then it's like Weezer covers and you're just like,"
25:30;25:32;"you know what, if that was a real Weezer song,"
25:32;25:33;"it'd be like top five Weezer song."
25:33;25:35;"- Is that where we're at with Jamflow, man?"
25:35;25:36;"Or are we just sort of like, you know what,"
25:36;25:38;"throw in the towel, it's a good song."
25:38;25:39;"We might be."
25:39;25:41;"- Well, we got a lot to say about this song."
25:41;25:44;"It's 'cause like, I know we probably have some jam head,"
25:44;25:45;"I don't know what you call it, just somebody like,"
25:45;25:46;"- Jam heads."
25:46;25:48;"- I love jam bands, man."
25:48;25:50;"From Twiddle to the Dead, I just love them all."
25:50;25:51;"But that never happens,"
25:51;25:53;"there's old people always draw lines in the sand,"
25:53;25:55;"but we probably have some TC heads"
25:55;25:57;"who are like pretty familiar with this world,"
25:57;25:59;"but a lot of them probably have no idea"
25:59;26:00;"what they're about to hear."
26:00;26:02;"So again, just so you understand,"
26:02;26:02;"- Strap in."
26:02;26:04;"- We're just reporting the news"
26:04;26:07;"that this song gets a lot of grief"
26:07;26:09;"from people within the jam community."
26:09;26:11;"- I guess we gotta look at Twiddle's set lists"
26:11;26:13;"and see how often they play Jamflow, man."
26:13;26:14;"- Oh, I've looked."
26:14;26:15;"- Did they play it every show?"
26:15;26:17;"- They played it once during their New Year's run,"
26:17;26:18;"this past New Year's."
26:18;26:19;"- How many shows did they do?"
26:19;26:21;"- I think they did three nights in Boston."
26:21;26:23;"No, two nights in Boston, I gotta double check."
26:23;26:25;"- No repeats or?"
26:25;26:28;"- I mostly just looked to see if I saw Jamflow, man, period."
26:28;26:30;"- We're going, 'cause they're playing March 1st"
26:30;26:30;"at the Troubadour."
26:30;26:31;"- Okay, we might have to."
26:31;26:32;"- We're going."
26:32;26:34;"- If they don't play it a lot, I almost wonder,"
26:34;26:37;"and if it's a song that has caused a lot of controversy"
26:37;26:39;"in the scene, I wonder if it's almost like Radiohead's"
26:39;26:40;"Creep for them."
26:40;26:42;"- Right, where they wanna like disavow it."
26:42;26:42;"- They're a little embarrassed."
26:42;26:44;"- And you know what, I've seen people,"
26:44;26:46;"like some mean-spirited Instagram posts"
26:46;26:48;"where somebody's taking pot shots at Twiddle,"
26:48;26:51;"and I've seen Twiddle fans get in there to defend Twiddle,"
26:51;26:53;"and even these fans sometimes will be like,"
26:53;26:55;"okay guys, ha ha ha, Jamflow, man,"
26:55;26:56;"they have a lot of other songs."
26:56;26:57;"- Okay."
26:57;26:59;"- So anyway, this is Jamflow, man, let's check it out."

28:52;28:53;"It's kind of hard to hear."
28:53;28:55;"- Fretless."
28:55;28:56;"- Oh yeah."
28:56;28:59;"- Pissed drunk on stage and still the man."
28:59;29:04;"- We already kind of heard all the lyrics."
29:04;29:07;"Okay, there's a few things about it."
29:07;29:09;"I think the biggest thing that the people"
29:09;29:13;"are reacting to, the haters, is the lyrics."
29:13;29:16;"I honestly have a theory that some jam heads"
29:16;29:19;"don't like this because it hits a little too close to home."
29:19;29:23;"- Because it's sort of like a frivolous party?"
29:23;29:24;"- No, no, I would almost say like,"
29:25;29:26;"it's starting to get intense."
29:26;29:36;"No, almost like, okay, I'm putting myself"
29:36;29:38;"in the haters' shoes because I'm not a hater"
29:38;29:39;"of this song, far from it."
29:39;29:42;"But if I put myself in the haters' shoes for a second,"
29:42;29:44;"I think the thing that they might not like about it"
29:44;29:48;"is that there's a kind of like, almost dorky earnestness"
29:48;29:50;"in the way he talks about this character,"
29:50;29:51;"the Jamflow man."
29:51;29:52;"Because basically the whole song is,"
29:52;29:54;"have you heard about this guy, the Jamflow man?"
29:54;29:56;"And it's kind of like a funny name."
29:56;29:57;"And then the rest of the thing is just like,"
29:57;29:58;"he's so good at jamming."
29:58;29:59;"- He's just a shredder."
29:59;30:01;"- He's a shredder, he's so good at jamming,"
30:01;30:04;"he's so awesome, he plays shows across the land,"
30:04;30:07;"and he kills every jam, and then they tell you more about him."
30:07;30:10;"So basically, there's a kind of dorky enthusiasm"
30:10;30:13;"that the singer has for the Jamflow man."
30:13;30:16;"Is that really that different than most jam fans?"
30:16;30:17;"What if I told you that the Jamflow man"
30:17;30:19;"was Mr. Jerry Garcia?"
30:19;30:22;"Now suddenly, is it so dorky that he's so excited"
30:22;30:24;"and enthusiastic about the Jamflow man?"
30:24;30:27;"What if I tell you the Jamflow man was Trey Anastasia?"
30:27;30:28;"- I'm pumped."
30:28;30:30;"- Yeah, suddenly it looks a little different."
30:30;30:31;"- You're getting the origin story,"
30:31;30:34;"you're getting the dark, kind of haunting third verse."
30:34;30:38;"- Yeah, this part's getting pretty prog-rock."
30:38;30:40;"(rock music)"
30:40;30:45;"- This part I'm not as into."
30:45;30:47;"- Although there's lots of jam that sounds like,"
30:47;30:49;"I think also this is like the early work,"
30:49;30:51;"it's like, maybe not the best mix."
30:51;30:54;"- Right, rough tones."
30:54;30:55;"- I think if you remix Jamflow man,"
30:55;30:57;"you could make it a lot more,"
30:57;30:59;"make the palette a little more tasteful."
30:59;31:02;"(rock music)"
31:04;31:25;"♪ Jamflow man ♪"
31:25;31:27;"- Jamflow man."
31:27;31:29;"- I truly think for some jam fans,"
31:29;31:30;"it's almost like, you know it's like"
31:30;31:32;"when you're into something, it's like,"
31:32;31:34;"you know you're into comic books or something,"
31:34;31:36;"and then you go see the Avengers movie,"
31:36;31:38;"and there's just like a 45 year old guy"
31:38;31:40;"in a Captain America outfit just like sitting there,"
31:40;31:42;"and you're just kind of like,"
31:42;31:43;"you're looking at him just like,"
31:43;31:45;"I'm a fan, but you're a nerd."
31:45;31:47;"- You're depressing me."
31:47;31:49;"So this is gonna be too on the nose."
31:49;31:49;"- It's a little on the nose,"
31:49;31:52;"or these people, it like reminds them of,"
31:52;31:53;"they like to think that their fandom"
31:53;31:56;"and their obsession with the various Jamflow men"
31:56;31:59;"that they admire is somehow sophisticated."
31:59;32:01;"And this maybe isn't sophisticated"
32:01;32:02;"in the way that they want it to be."
32:02;32:07;"- They did play it more this year in 2018."
32:07;32:08;"They played it nine times."
32:08;32:10;"- Compared to the last couple years?"
32:10;32:12;"- Yeah. - Okay."
32:12;32:14;"- But only nine times, so it's not like a staple of the set."
32:14;32:15;"- Although they're jam bands,"
32:15;32:16;"they probably pride themselves"
32:16;32:19;"on having drastically different sets night to night."
32:19;32:21;"- This part's tight."
32:21;32:25;"Kinder tone."
32:25;32:26;"- Yeah, this is a kinder tone."
32:28;32:30;"They're clearly very talented musicians."
32:30;32:33;"(upbeat jazz music)"
32:33;32:44;"- Now I think people that are not jam band aficionados"
32:44;32:47;"might take issue with his singing style."
32:47;32:48;"- Right, that's probably part of it."
32:48;32:49;"- And I think, 'cause I've played this song"
32:49;32:52;"for a few people that are not jam band fans,"
32:52;32:53;"and they're just like, yikes."
32:53;32:56;"Kind of how people react to like Dave Matthews."
32:56;32:57;"- Right."
32:57;32:59;"- But if you're in the jam band scene,"
32:59;33:01;"I don't think you're gonna take issue with his voice,"
33:01;33:05;"'cause a lot of jam bands have like vocalists like that."
33:05;33:06;"- Right."
33:06;33:08;"- And if you like twiddle, then you're in."
33:08;33:10;"- The jam world, it seems to me,"
33:10;33:13;"it's more about like, does the singer have like character"
33:13;33:14;"and sense of humor?"
33:14;33:17;"It's like, and he clearly does."
33:17;33:18;"Not bad at guitar either."
33:18;33:21;"(upbeat jazz music)"
33:21;33:44;","
33:44;33:45;"- Approaching minute seven."
33:45;33:48;"Yeah, I wonder if this is earlier in their career,"
33:48;33:49;"this song."
33:49;33:50;"What year is this song from?"
33:50;33:51;"Does anyone know?"
33:51;33:52;"- Yeah, it's on the album,"
33:52;33:54;"Natural Evolution of Consciousness."
33:54;33:55;"- Great title."
33:55;33:59;"I mean, twiddle's from Burlington, I think."
33:59;34:00;"- Oh, that's cool."
34:00;34:02;"- Same town as Fish."
34:02;34:02;"- Yeah, I wonder."
34:02;34:04;"- So maybe people are like, come on guys,"
34:04;34:06;"you're treading a little close."
34:06;34:08;"- That doesn't seem fair."
34:08;34:09;"- No."
34:09;34:10;"If anything, it'd be exciting."
34:10;34:13;"It'd be like, yo, there's something in the water"
34:13;34:14;"in Burlington."
34:14;34:16;"- This song was released in 2007."
34:16;34:18;"- Okay, so relatively earlier in their career."
34:18;34:19;"It's like a long time ago."
34:19;34:21;"- Yeah, this is a solid 12 years ago."
34:21;34:24;"I wonder if twiddle's on Fish's radar."
34:24;34:25;"- Oh, I'm sure."
34:25;34:26;"- A little bit aware of it."
34:26;34:27;"- Dimly aware."
34:27;34:28;"- I think."
34:28;34:29;"(laughing)"
34:29;34:31;"- I bet they know."
34:31;34:33;"- So I think the reason people maybe"
34:33;34:34;"will respond negatively to that song,"
34:34;34:35;"I think you're right."
34:35;34:37;"Some people, either you're into the singing style,"
34:37;34:39;"you're not, whatever, that's personal preference."
34:39;34:41;"The production, it's their early (beep),"
34:41;34:43;"you know, like whatever."
34:43;34:45;"And then I think the narrative hits a little close to home"
34:45;34:47;"for some of these guys."
34:47;34:49;"So we've listened to the song a lot together."
34:49;34:51;"- Yeah, we hung out like a few weeks ago."
34:51;34:52;"- Yeah."
34:52;34:53;"- At your house and--"
34:53;34:55;"- We were jamming this."
34:55;34:58;"- This was on repeat for a solid hour."
34:58;34:59;"- There was a lot of singing."
34:59;35:02;"And also, we kind of dissected the lyrics,"
35:02;35:03;"which is interesting."
35:03;35:06;"'Cause if you really get into the lyrics,"
35:06;35:07;"I like where he took it."
35:07;35:08;"It's like, it's not just random."
35:08;35:09;"He's telling a story."
35:09;35:12;"I like these mythical characters."
35:12;35:13;"(laughing)"
35:13;35:14;"And I was thinking about this,"
35:14;35:16;"that we talked about one quite a bit last year,"
35:16;35:18;"and that's Bob Dylan's ""Joker Man."""
35:18;35:22;"♪ Joker man dance through the night and get ♪"
35:22;35:25;"♪ Moved by a high by the light of the moon ♪"
35:25;35:29;"♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪"
35:29;35:30;"♪ Joker man ♪"
35:30;35:32;"- So the Joker man is this mystical,"
35:32;35:35;"I mean, my theory is that he's kind of a trickster figure."
35:35;35:36;"We've gotten emails from people who's like,"
35:36;35:38;"""No, Joker man, he's everybody, man."""
35:38;35:41;"Also thought that the Joker man is half Joker, half Batman."
35:41;35:43;"He's a little bit the duality of man."
35:43;35:45;"Whatever, the Joker man is clearly"
35:45;35:47;"this fascinating, mythical figure."
35:47;35:49;"Perhaps he represents all of us."
35:49;35:51;"Perhaps he represents a certain side of humanity."
35:51;35:55;"And maybe Jamflow Man is kind of like this other character."
35:55;35:58;"- It's like a weird update on Johnny B. Goode."
35:58;35:58;"- Yeah."
35:58;35:59;"- In a way."
35:59;36:01;"- Johnny B. Goode and the Jamflow Man,"
36:01;36:05;"they're both kind of like modern day tall tales."
36:05;36:06;"- Yeah."
36:06;36:07;"- I wonder if they still teach kids"
36:07;36:09;"about tall tales in school."
36:09;36:10;"'Cause I feel like I remember"
36:10;36:12;"learning about tall tales a lot."
36:12;36:13;"- Just like Paul Bunyan and stuff."
36:13;36:15;"- Yeah, tall tales are like this way"
36:15;36:17;"to kind of teach kids like,"
36:17;36:19;"America's a young country."
36:19;36:20;"I can almost picture this in like"
36:20;36:22;"a fourth grade history lesson,"
36:22;36:25;"just being like, what is American culture?"
36:25;36:26;"We're a melting pot."
36:26;36:28;"So we have people from all over the place."
36:28;36:30;"But even in America, we have culture."
36:30;36:32;"Part of a culture is myths, you know?"
36:32;36:33;"And then they'd probably tell you"
36:33;36:35;"about some Native American myths"
36:35;36:37;"or like Rumble Stillskin or something."
36:37;36:38;"- Yeah, some folk heroes."
36:38;36:40;"- And in America, we call these tall tales."
36:40;36:41;"It's like in bold."
36:41;36:43;"It'd be like Paul Bunyan."
36:43;36:45;"And Paul Bunyan was a giant man with an ax."
36:45;36:47;"- Yeah, and a blue ox."
36:47;36:48;"- Oh yeah, and a blue ox named--"
36:48;36:49;"- He was a very good forester."
36:49;36:50;"- Named Babe?"
36:50;36:51;"- I think so."
36:51;36:52;"That rings a bell."
36:52;36:53;"- Where did that even come from?"
36:53;36:56;"Just like 19th century, just like--"
36:56;36:59;"- People are trying to tame the West, you know?"
36:59;37:03;"- Yeah, I'm sure people have written dissertations about,"
37:03;37:06;"how did the tall tale of Paul Bunyan"
37:06;37:08;"reflect the sexual anxiety"
37:08;37:11;"of 19th century American male homesteaders?"
37:11;37:13;"What was going on with these guys"
37:13;37:14;"that they needed to imagine?"
37:14;37:19;"A 40 foot tall lumberjack with a blue ox."
37:19;37:21;"There's also John Henry."
37:21;37:23;"He was this super strong guy"
37:23;37:24;"and he had a hammer that he would use"
37:24;37:27;"to like whack a hole in a mountain."
37:27;37:29;"Then some like, you know,"
37:29;37:32;"Northeastern industrialists show up with their new machine,"
37:32;37:34;"some sort of boring machine."
37:34;37:37;"The Elon Musks of their day."
37:37;37:39;"They have their own boring company"
37:39;37:41;"to bore a hole into a mountain."
37:41;37:42;"- And no plain view."
37:42;37:44;"- And John Henry, everybody's like,"
37:44;37:45;"well, John Henry's the best at doing this (beep)"
37:45;37:46;"with his hammer."
37:46;37:48;"We don't need your new fangled technology."
37:48;37:49;"And then they're like, well, let's have a face-off."
37:49;37:51;"And they do, and he's like beating it"
37:51;37:52;"and then he dies, right?"
37:52;37:53;"- I don't know that one."
37:53;37:55;"- That's kind of a brutal tall tale."
37:55;37:56;"- You will lose to technology."
37:56;37:58;"- John Henry's heart gives out."
37:58;37:59;"- Due to stress."
37:59;38:00;"- So yeah, I guess--"
38:00;38:02;"- He's trying to fight a machine."
38:02;38:03;"- I guess that makes sense."
38:03;38:04;"In the 19th century,"
38:04;38:07;"the 19th century Americans needed to believe"
38:07;38:08;"in these big men."
38:08;38:09;"- Yeah."
38:09;38:12;"- Whacking around hammers and axes."
38:12;38:14;"Just like in the early 21st century,"
38:14;38:15;"we need to believe in a--"
38:15;38:16;"- In a gem flow, man."
38:16;38:18;"- Guitar virtuoso."
38:18;38:19;"- Yeah."

39:27;39:30;"- So, everybody needs their mythical hero to believe in."
39:30;39:32;"Especially for men."
39:32;39:37;"Men sometimes need the idea of somebody larger than life."
39:37;39:38;"He's the Ubermensch."
39:38;39:40;"He's the epitome of everything"
39:40;39:41;"that the man wishes he could be."
39:41;39:43;"If these 19th century American men"
39:43;39:45;"wish that they could be 30 feet tall"
39:45;39:48;"and have a blue ox or whatever,"
39:48;39:50;"they need to imagine this guy."
39:50;39:52;"And yeah, maybe for the Jamflow community"
39:52;39:55;"of the early 21st century, they need to imagine."
39:55;39:59;"Maybe also, Jamflow man was intended to be a unifying figure."
39:59;40:01;"People always debating, like, well, who's the best guitarist?"
40:01;40:03;"Is it Jerry Garcia, is it Trey Anastasia,"
40:03;40:04;"throwing other names at it?"
40:04;40:06;"And maybe it's like, well, you know what?"
40:06;40:07;"It's the Jamflow man."
40:07;40:08;"- It's the Jamflow man."
40:08;40:10;"- Yeah, you can picture, like, in the lot"
40:10;40:13;"at some, like, jam show, a bunch of guys are like,"
40:13;40:14;"well, clearly, you know, Garcia's the best."
40:14;40:16;"And somebody's like, no way, man."
40:16;40:18;"If you really know your (beep),"
40:18;40:20;"you know that it's Hendrix, and they're debating."
40:20;40:22;"And then just, like, an old timer speaks up from the back."
40:22;40:24;"Have you ever heard of the Jamflow man?"
40:24;40:25;"(laughing)"
40:25;40:27;"- Like, takes his hood off slowly."
40:27;40:28;"- Yeah."
40:28;40:29;"- He's got one eye."
40:30;40:32;"- What are you talking about, man?"
40:32;40:35;"- Well, there's no recordings of him, but I saw him once."
40:35;40:37;"- Yeah, I saw him once."
40:37;40:39;"And he was better than Garcia and Hendrix combined."
40:39;40:41;"- He was quick as lightning."
40:41;40:42;"- Well, that is--"
40:42;40:44;"- Wait, is that actually the first line of the song?"
40:44;40:45;"Have you ever heard of the Jamflow man?"
40:47;40:49;"- See, here's what I like about this song, too."
40:49;40:52;"He's like an obscure local hero."
40:52;40:53;"- Yeah."
40:53;40:55;"- Like, he never tries to get a record contract."
40:55;40:56;"♪ Have you heard of the Jamflow man's jam ♪"
40:56;40:58;"♪ Sickest and the quickest hands in the land ♪"
40:58;41:01;"- Okay, sickest and the quickest hands in the land."
41:01;41:01;"- Have you heard of the Jam--"
41:01;41:02;"- That is the most sick rhyme."
41:02;41:03;"- That is pretty sick."
41:03;41:04;"Have you heard of the Jamflow man,"
41:04;41:07;"jam sickest and the quickest hands in the land?"
41:07;41:09;"- Hands, land."
41:09;41:12;"- Even the fact that he keeps using the phrase in the land,"
41:12;41:14;"it's very clear that he's trying to position"
41:14;41:16;"the Jamflow man as being a tall tale--"
41:16;41:17;"- Right."
41:17;41:18;"- American mythological figure."
41:18;41:19;"- Absolutely."
41:19;41:20;"But you know, it's funny, like,"
41:20;41:23;"a lot of the rock and roll songs, like Johnny B. Goode,"
41:23;41:26;"or that Tom Petty song, Learning to Fly,"
41:26;41:29;"which is about, like, a guy moving out to LA"
41:29;41:29;"to be a rock star."
41:29;41:30;"- Oh yeah."
41:30;41:33;"- And then there's a Bad Company song called Shooting Star,"
41:33;41:34;"which is another similar thing of like--"
41:34;41:37;"♪ You know that you are a shooting star ♪"
41:37;41:38;"- Good song."
41:38;41:40;"But that's also like a tragic story about, like,"
41:40;41:44;"the rise and fall of, like, someone becoming a rock star"
41:44;41:45;"and, like, that archetype."
41:45;41:46;"- Right."
41:46;41:47;"- But what I like about Jamflow man is that"
41:47;41:49;"he's like a local bar fly."
41:49;41:50;"- Right."
41:50;41:51;"- Who never gigs outside his bar."
41:51;41:53;"Like, that's how I interpret the song."
41:53;41:56;"He's just like a local loser who's just like,"
41:56;41:58;"has no ambition."
41:58;42:01;"But he is the true Jedi."
42:01;42:02;"- Right, 'cause it's also like, you know,"
42:02;42:04;"maybe in some ways this song,"
42:04;42:06;"and the reason that these people react so angrily to it,"
42:06;42:10;"is this song is a gentle rebuke of the jam scene,"
42:10;42:13;"where you get this kind of stats geek mentality"
42:13;42:16;"where people wanna compile every song,"
42:16;42:17;"every show you've seen."
42:17;42:20;"You know, I've seen like 30 versions of Fluffhead,"
42:20;42:22;"and I'll say, ""This one is definitely the best."
42:22;42:24;"""This one's top five."
42:24;42:26;"""This one was dog (beep) because Trey's tone was off."""
42:26;42:27;"You know, like--"
42:27;42:28;"- Yeah, yeah."
42:28;42:30;"- And maybe this guy's like, ""I laugh at you, you fools,"
42:30;42:34;"""spending so much time cataloging this ephemeral music,"
42:34;42:39;"""debating, questioning, ranking, creating hierarchies."
42:39;42:42;"""The best guitarist and the best jam,"
42:42;42:44;"""it wasn't one of the fish shows you went to."
42:44;42:47;"""It wasn't a 77 Dead show."
42:47;42:48;"""It was the Jamflow man."""
42:48;42:50;"Well, I've never even heard of the Jamflow man,"
42:50;42:53;"so by my calculations, you're right, you never heard him."
42:53;42:55;"You never will. - Listen, son."
42:55;42:57;"Give me quantitative proof."
42:57;42:58;"- Is there a board recording?"
42:58;43:00;"Were there any tapers at the show?"
43:00;43:02;"No, it was the purest jam of all."
43:02;43:03;"It came and went."
43:03;43:04;"And you know what's funny, man?"
43:04;43:08;"Going back to the, this is such a jam-heavy segment."
43:08;43:11;"Going back to like The Grateful Dead,"
43:11;43:15;"has anybody watched that great Grateful Dead six-hour doc?"
43:15;43:16;"This part really struck me, actually,"
43:16;43:17;"in The Grateful Dead doc."
43:17;43:19;"I don't think we ever talked about this."
43:19;43:22;"Somebody's telling the story about the dead played"
43:22;43:26;"in the Los Angeles area, and they were down at Watts."
43:26;43:27;"I might be mistelling the story,"
43:27;43:28;"but this is how I remember it."
43:28;43:32;"Jerry and Bob are walking around on acid after the show,"
43:32;43:34;"and they come across the Watts Towers."
43:34;43:35;"And for anybody who doesn't know,"
43:35;43:36;"the Watts Towers are essentially,"
43:36;43:38;"I guess you'd call them outsider art,"
43:38;43:41;"where some random dude who lived in Watts"
43:41;43:43;"built these kind of incredible towers,"
43:43;43:44;"just kind of in his backyard, right?"
43:44;43:46;"This is not a professional artist."
43:46;43:50;"This is a dude who made these kind of bizarre towers,"
43:50;43:52;"and made with bric-a-brac,"
43:52;43:54;"whatever he could get his hands on."
43:54;43:56;"And when this guy died, and people came over and saw it,"
43:56;43:57;"he built this crazy, they were like,"
43:57;43:58;"""What is this guy, a hoarder?"""
43:58;43:59;"And like the city tried to take him down."
43:59;44:01;"But they were actually so well-built,"
44:01;44:03;"this almost sounds like a tall tale,"
44:03;44:04;"they were so well-built that the city"
44:04;44:05;"couldn't take him down."
44:05;44:06;"And they were like, ""You know, let's leave them up."""
44:06;44:10;"And it's an iconic part of Southern California culture,"
44:10;44:11;"and certainly Watts, the Watts Towers."
44:11;44:13;"They're these famous things."
44:13;44:14;"So, you know, most of us would look at that"
44:14;44:15;"as like a cool story."
44:15;44:18;"And so, in the movie, they're recounting the story"
44:18;44:22;"that Jerry and Bob are on acid, or coming off acid,"
44:22;44:24;"and they roll up and they see the Watts Towers,"
44:24;44:25;"and somebody's talking about it."
44:25;44:28;"You know, just like this dude made this by himself."
44:28;44:29;"And after he died, and they tried to take it down,"
44:29;44:32;"they couldn't, 'cause it was so well-built"
44:32;44:33;"that they couldn't take it down."
44:33;44:36;"So of course, I'm imagining where the story's gonna go,"
44:36;44:40;"and I'm thinking, based on my own, whatever,"
44:40;44:44;"ego-based, late capitalist narcissism,"
44:44;44:46;"I'm picturing that one of the guys is about to say,"
44:46;44:47;"'cause this is early Grateful Deadness,"
44:47;44:48;"I'm picturing that one of the guys is about to say,"
44:48;44:49;"""You know what, man?"
44:49;44:52;"""We're gonna build something that nobody can take down"
44:52;44:53;"""with our music."""
44:53;44:55;"Like, that's what it would be with like,"
44:55;44:59;"U2 or the Rolling Stones or Foo Fighters or something."
44:59;45:00;"And then instead--"
45:00;45:01;"- Foo Fighters?"
45:01;45:03;"- Yeah, I don't know, I said Foo Fighters."
45:03;45:05;"That's what the typical rock and roll story would be."
45:05;45:08;"But then, as is recounted in the film,"
45:08;45:09;"what Jerry says to Bob is like,"
45:09;45:10;"I'm not gonna get the words right,"
45:10;45:12;"but basically something like,"
45:12;45:13;"""What a bummer, man."
45:13;45:15;"""Nothing should last forever."""
45:15;45:16;"- Whoa."
45:16;45:17;"- It was some (beep) where he basically was like,"
45:17;45:21;"""What we do is we create something that's the opposite."
45:21;45:23;"""Every night we do something together"
45:23;45:26;"""that is ephemeral, that comes and goes, it vanishes."""
45:26;45:27;"And you could almost picture that."
45:27;45:28;"- Wow."
45:28;45:28;"- If he was on acid and he--"
45:28;45:29;"- That is reversed, I love it."
45:29;45:31;"- I know, and I was like, really like,"
45:31;45:33;"I've like paused it, and I was like,"
45:33;45:34;"""Damn, Jerry."""
45:34;45:35;"- I gotta take that one in."
45:35;45:36;"- Especially because--"
45:36;45:37;"- Jeez."
45:37;45:39;"- You know, the irony of it is that"
45:39;45:40;"now we're at this point of like,"
45:40;45:44;"intense Grateful Dead nostalgia, whatever,"
45:44;45:45;"and the movie gets into it."
45:45;45:47;"The irony that you're watching a documentary"
45:47;45:49;"50 years later that's talking about"
45:49;45:51;"the sense of community and the permanence"
45:51;45:53;"in American culture of this band,"
45:53;45:55;"and then to find out that the leader"
45:55;45:59;"in his like, most mystical, open-minded state,"
45:59;46:02;"actually, his vibe, that maybe there'd even be"
46:02;46:04;"a part of him that if he knew"
46:04;46:06;"that there were like a billion people"
46:06;46:07;"touring around playing their music,"
46:07;46:09;"if he knew what Richard Pictures was up to."
46:09;46:10;"- No, I'm just kidding."
46:10;46:11;"He'd probably appreciate that."
46:11;46:13;"- I think he'd be down with Richard Pictures,"
46:13;46:14;"'cause we're--"
46:14;46:15;"- Yeah, he might be less into the super pro (beep)"
46:15;46:17;"- An ephemeral thing at a bar that--"
46:17;46:18;"- Yeah, he'd probably actually be more"
46:18;46:20;"into Richard Pictures than into--"
46:20;46:21;"- The pro."
46:21;46:22;"- Although, you know, those are his boys,"
46:22;46:25;"so I don't wanna get into family business, but--"
46:25;46:28;"- He would love Richard Pictures,"
46:28;46:30;"but he would hate fish."
46:30;46:32;"But he would love Twiddle."
46:32;46:33;"- He would love Twiddle. - Okay?"
46:33;46:34;"- You heard it here."
46:34;46:36;"- And think about it, man."
46:36;46:38;"This is the godfather of jam."
46:38;46:39;"- Think about it, man."
46:39;46:41;"- Jerry Garcia, and of course--"
46:41;46:42;"- Wow, bummer."
46:42;46:43;"Nothing should last forever."
46:43;46:44;"- Yeah, and you know, it's funny,"
46:44;46:46;"because then, of course, they were open-minded."
46:46;46:48;"They understood that the fans wanted to tape their shows,"
46:48;46:49;"and they let them do that,"
46:49;46:51;"because they weren't into being cops,"
46:51;46:53;"telling people what they can and cannot do."
46:53;46:55;"You know, the fans do what they wanna do,"
46:55;46:58;"but the tapes turn these ephemeral moments"
46:58;47:01;"of the live show into very permanent things,"
47:01;47:03;"and they literally now, there's databases"
47:03;47:05;"of these things that were supposed to come and go."
47:05;47:08;"So anyway, I'm not saying that I could ever know"
47:08;47:10;"Jerry's full thought process about this stuff,"
47:10;47:14;"but just at one moment in the early days, he said this."
47:14;47:15;"And it's kinda like the ultimate, you know,"
47:15;47:17;"you're on acid, maybe you're ultimately trying"
47:17;47:20;"to get past the ego, and it's like,"
47:20;47:22;"I don't wanna do things that last forever."
47:22;47:24;"I wanna live in the now and coast around."
47:24;47:25;"I don't need people to remember me."

50:05;50:06;"- Early rock and roll."
50:06;50:07;"- Yeah."
50:07;50:08;"- Well, it's also kind of like early rock and roll"
50:08;50:10;"is blues based, and then taking the improvisational"
50:10;50:12;"element of jazz, now you're starting to get"

50:48;50:51;"In fact, he was only 10 years old when I first saw him."
50:51;50:52;"(laughs)"
50:52;50:53;"- It's like Luke Skywalker."
50:53;50:56;"- Yes, he's basically Luke Skywalker."
50:56;50:59;"This is that Joseph Campbell (beep)"
50:59;51:01;"- This is basically Yoda telling the story."
51:01;51:03;"- Yeah, and then he was real good now"

51:06;51:08;"- Oh, I guess that kind of pokes a hole in my theory,"
51:08;51:10;"but whatever, I like my theory."
51:10;51:11;"- Well he's playing in--"
51:11;51:12;"- He was just like a bar band guy."
51:12;51:13;"- Well--"
51:13;51:14;"- Didn't make a fortune."
51:14;51:15;"- Although--"
51:15;51:16;"- That's the feel I get."
51:16;51:17;"- Okay, well hold on."
51:17;51:17;"- Okay."
51:17;51:19;"- He's playing in the clubs making a fortune."
51:19;51:20;"- Right."
51:20;51:21;"- Now--"
51:21;51:21;"- Maybe fortune for him was just like,"
51:21;51:22;"you know, paying the rent."
51:22;51:24;"- Yeah, a few drink tickets."
51:24;51:26;"- Yeah man, drunk by five."
51:26;51:29;"- Taking some cold cuts home from the rider."
51:29;51:30;"- That's all I need man."
51:30;51:31;"- Some cold nachos."
51:31;51:32;"- This is my fortune."
51:32;51:34;"It's that Bob Marley (beep)"
51:34;51:36;"Now Jamflow man, do you have a fortune?"
51:36;51:38;"What do you mean fortune?"
51:38;51:39;"I think it's notable that he says,"
51:39;51:41;"""Playing in the clubs making a fortune."""
51:41;51:42;"'Cause--"
51:42;51:43;"- Yeah."
51:43;51:45;"- Anytime you read about the meteoric rise of a band,"
51:45;51:49;"they always say, ""They went from playing smoky clubs"
51:49;51:51;"""to headlining festivals and arenas,"" or whatever."
51:51;51:52;"- Right."
51:52;51:53;"- Like if you read the story of Phish,"
51:53;51:55;"at some point they graduated from clubs to whatever."
51:55;51:56;"- Yeah."
51:56;51:58;"- So the Jamflow man's making a fortune in the clubs."
51:58;51:59;"- Right."
51:59;52:00;"- He's making a local fortune."
52:00;52:01;"- Yeah, okay I love it."

52:31;52:32;"Who doesn't?"
52:32;52:33;"- Yep."
52:33;52:34;"- So far we're just like, all right,"
52:34;52:35;"he's a normal rock guy."
52:35;52:37;"He likes to smoke weed and have a stiff drink, cool."
52:37;52:39;"Went to the bar everyday at two."
52:39;52:44;"- Yeah, that's, this level of detail is what I love."
52:44;52:45;"It makes the song."
52:45;52:47;"- Yeah, this is kind of the best line in the story."
52:47;52:48;"- Drunk by five."
52:48;52:50;"- Was drunk by five and had a jam to do."
52:50;52:51;"- No sweat."
52:51;52:55;"- But also, it's obviously--"
52:55;52:57;"- He's like a guy that's hammered at five."
52:57;52:59;"He's not going on 'til like 10."
52:59;53:01;"Like it's still another five hours of drinking."
53:01;53:02;"- And there's also--"
53:02;53:04;"(laughing)"
53:04;53:06;"Well, first of all, we gotta look at the context"
53:06;53:07;"of the whole song."
53:07;53:08;"So far there's been nothing negative"
53:08;53:10;"about the Jamflow man's story."
53:10;53:11;"He's an incredible guitarist."
53:11;53:13;"- Child prodigy."
53:13;53:14;"- Yeah."
53:14;53:18;"When he plays, he's the best in the land, blah, blah, blah."
53:18;53:21;"And then just out of nowhere, it's this one line."
53:21;53:23;"Sometimes a one line can make or break a song."
53:23;53:24;"- Oh man."
53:24;53:25;"- He went to the bar every day at two,"
53:25;53:27;"was drunk by five and had a jam to do."
53:27;53:30;"So then it's kind of like, wait, does he even want a jam?"
53:30;53:33;"- Yeah, this guy, it's like if Luke Skywalker"
53:33;53:35;"was like a crazy alcoholic."
53:35;53:37;"- Yeah, he's an antihero."
53:37;53:39;"The Jamflow man is an antihero."
53:39;53:43;"And maybe it's also like, there had to be a dark side."
53:43;53:44;"- Yeah, man."
53:44;53:45;"That's real."
53:45;53:47;"- It's like some inside Llewyn Davis thing."
53:47;53:50;"It's like you're the guy right before Bob Dylan."
53:50;53:52;"Maybe the Jamflow man stayed in the clubs"
53:52;53:56;"and never made it to be venerated like Jerry or Trey."
53:56;53:59;"Not because he's a humble guy who didn't want the attention,"
53:59;54:01;"but like maybe his alcoholism kept him there"
54:01;54:03;"or maybe he was driven to drink"
54:03;54:06;"by a series of unfortunate events."
54:06;54:08;"So he gets to the bar at two, he's already drunk by five,"
54:08;54:10;"and he's gonna be just keep drinking."
54:10;54:11;"And then he has a jam to do."
54:11;54:12;"- He's got a jam, okay."

54:25;54:26;"- He was still the man."
54:26;54:27;"- He was so good."
54:27;54:31;"- There's so much more to this song than meets the eye."
54:31;54:33;"If you hear this song and you're just like, it's cheesy."
54:33;54:35;"You know, it's almost like, you know some people,"
54:35;54:36;"they like Batman better than Superman"
54:36;54:39;"because they're just like Superman, there's no drama."
54:39;54:41;"He's just like a goody two shoes, whatever."
54:41;54:44;"Batman is tortured."

54:56;54:57;"- Yeah, dude."
54:57;55:00;"- Jamflow man is Deadpool."

55:14;55:15;"- Yeah."
55:15;55:17;"- And then at that point, we're about to kind of just like,"

55:44;55:46;"Piss drunk on stage, he was still the man."
55:49;56:14;"- Yeah, and then you get in this kind of like sensitive,"
56:14;56:15;"sad moment."
56:15;56:17;"- Yeah, this part's tight."
56:17;56:19;"- Are you okay, Jamflow man?"
56:19;56:20;"- What?"
56:20;56:22;"- Like, yeah, this is the moment where Jamflow man's"
56:22;56:23;"getting like real sensitive."
56:23;56:26;"Then, you know, at one point last night,"
56:26;56:28;"Jamflow man turned his back to the crowd."
56:28;56:31;"Almost seemed like he was crying."
56:31;56:32;"What are you talking about?"
56:32;56:34;"He's the best guitarist in Burlington."
56:34;56:38;"What would Jamflow man have to be upset about?"
56:38;56:40;"I don't know, I just got this like sad energy from him."
56:46;57:10;"- Now this is Jamflow man drinking his feelings away."
57:10;57:11;"These times are rough."
57:13;57:16;"- This part almost reminds me of the band Boston."
57:16;57:17;"- Totally. - That keyboard tone."
57:17;57:18;"- Oh yeah, yeah, totally."
57:18;57:21;"- It's been such a long time."
57:21;57:23;"You know what I noticed in the,"
57:23;57:24;"I was surprised by in the Twiddle doc?"
57:24;57:25;"- Yeah."
57:25;57:27;"- Is that there's only four people in the band."
57:27;57:29;"And I think there's only one guitarist."
57:29;57:30;"There's guitar, bass."
57:30;57:32;"- Yeah, the singer plays guitar."
57:32;57:34;"It's the same as Phish."
57:34;57:36;"- I guess so, I guess Phish is only one guitar."
57:36;57:38;"- I was watching some solo stuff from the singer Mahali."
57:38;57:40;"He seems like a-- - Solo?"
57:40;57:41;"Like a solo gig?"
57:41;57:43;"- He did like a recent solo acoustic tour"
57:43;57:44;"with a loop pedal."
57:44;57:45;"- Whoa."
57:45;57:47;"- He was doing like some sublime songs."
57:47;57:48;"Which you know I love."
57:48;57:50;"And I was like, he seems like a (beep) chill dude."
57:50;57:52;"And there's also just a part of me that's like,"
57:52;57:54;"look, I can see that there's some like elements"
57:54;57:56;"that some people might find silly about Jamflow man."
57:56;57:58;"But you know, there's always been that part of me,"
57:58;58:00;"it's like I see people beating up on something"
58:00;58:03;"and I just wanna be like, what's really going on here?"
58:03;58:05;"I wanna find the positive in it."
58:05;58:06;"And then yeah, like we were talking about"
58:06;58:08;"in that documentary that you sent me."
58:08;58:11;"You see the enthusiasm of like the hardcore Twiddle fans."
58:11;58:13;"There's a part where they're interviewing people"
58:13;58:15;"outside the club at the show."
58:15;58:17;"And there's one guy who's talking about it."
58:17;58:19;"How he's seen 125 shows."
58:19;58:21;"And then somebody's like, you know what show this is for me?"
58:21;58:22;"And the guy's like, what?"
58:22;58:23;"And he's like, it's my first."
58:23;58:24;"And then they kind of have this moment"
58:24;58:25;"where he's like, well welcome."
58:25;58:27;"You know, welcome to the community."
58:27;58:28;"- The club is open."
58:28;58:29;"- Yeah."
58:29;58:30;"Change the production a little bit."
58:30;58:33;"That song go down a lot easier for certain listeners."
58:33;58:35;"There's a few live versions on Apple Music."
58:35;58:38;"This one's from January, 2017."
58:38;58:42;"It's on the Jam Cruise."
58:42;58:43;"- See if the crowd reacts."

01:00:02;01:00:04;"are these lyrics supposed to be funny?"
01:00:04;01:00:05;"- Right."

01:00:14;01:00:16;"- I feel like you played that on the TC in the early days."
01:00:16;01:00:18;"- Maybe I did, like talking about like writing like--"

01:00:57;01:00:59;"like if you gave Bruce the lyrical prompt,"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"like you played Bruce, Jam Flow Man."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"- Yeah."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"- You explain the mythology."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"- Yeah."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"- And you're like, Bruce, write your Jam Flow Man."
01:01:05;01:01:07;"- I mean, the funny thing is,"
01:01:07;01:01:08;"with all this stuff,"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"it's like the critically acclaimed (beep)"
01:01:11;01:01:14;"and the made fun of on jam message boards,"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"they're all kind of operating with the same tools,"
01:01:16;01:01:17;"you know?"
01:01:17;01:01:21;"Bruce is a student of American myth as well."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"- Yeah, no, absolutely."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"- For him, like Thunder Roads,"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"even like Thunder Roads,"
01:01:25;01:01:26;"just like imagine if Arcade Fire"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"came out with a song called Thunder Road."
01:01:28;01:01:29;"- Right."
01:01:29;01:01:31;"- People would be like, okay."
01:01:31;01:01:32;"- Whatever, dudes."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"- Right."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"- Oh, the screen door slams,"
01:01:34;01:01:35;"are you trying to be poetic?"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"- Yeah, Thunder Road, real epic."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"Like, (laughs)"
01:01:39;01:01:42;"I've never heard of a street called Thunder Road."
01:01:42;01:01:43;"But you know, Bruce pulled it off"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"and it's like, I mean, in some ways,"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"Bruce was kind of like a Jam Flow Man."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"He was like the local legend,"
01:01:48;01:01:51;"like working his way up in the Jersey Shore clubs."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"- Yeah, the early part of his memoir,"
01:01:53;01:01:56;"when he's talking about gigging for years."
01:01:56;01:01:56;"- Just working their asses off."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"- It's epic."
01:01:57;01:02:00;"- Yeah, just to really put on like a fun show"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"for just like drunk people down the shore."
01:02:02;01:02:03;"That's where they learned all their tricks."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"How do you get a crowd to react?"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"Like fun little gimmick type things."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"I remember also in the book,"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"he says something about how at a certain point,"
01:02:10;01:02:11;"he realized he was pretty good at guitar,"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"but he's never gonna be the best guitarist around."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"- Right, right."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"- So essentially he realized"
01:02:15;01:02:16;"he was never gonna be the Jam Flow Man,"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"but you know what he could be?"
01:02:18;01:02:19;"He could be the Joker Man."
01:02:19;01:02:22;"He could be the guy who writes these stories"
01:02:22;01:02:25;"that mix humor and seriousness and stuff."
01:02:25;01:02:26;"The Joker Man's in the mind"
01:02:26;01:02:28;"and the Jam Flow Man's in the hands."
01:02:28;01:02:29;"- Body and mind, dude."
01:02:29;01:02:32;"- And good music needs a Joker Man and a Jam Flow Man."
01:02:32;01:02:33;"Yeah, I feel like the Jam Flow Man--"
01:02:33;01:02:36;"- So we're really uncovering"
01:02:36;01:02:39;"some deep universal truths right now."
01:02:39;01:02:41;"- In the time crisis mythological universe,"
01:02:41;01:02:43;"there are two main deities."
01:02:43;01:02:46;"You have your Joker Man and you have your Jam Flow Man."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"At the feast of the Joker Man,"
01:02:47;01:02:50;"the Jam Flow Man's ascension was considered"
01:02:50;01:02:53;"to take place on 7/28/2018,"
01:02:53;01:02:57;"when Twiddle played Jam Flow Man live at Tumbledown."
01:02:57;01:03:00;"- I wonder if Bernie is aware of Twiddle."
01:03:00;01:03:01;"- That's a great question."
01:03:01;01:03:04;"- That's pushing it, but it might be possible."
01:03:04;01:03:07;"- Bernie Sanders says he's from Burlington, Vermont,"
01:03:07;01:03:10;"but can he even name his favorite Jam Flow Man?"
01:03:10;01:03:16;"August 14th, that doesn't even exist, Senator."
01:03:16;01:03:19;"Now the Jam Flow Man, find anything?"
01:03:19;01:03:20;"- Wait."
01:03:20;01:03:21;"- Any Sanders/Twiddle connections?"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"- Senator Bernie Sanders introduces Twiddle"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"at Tumbledown 2018."
01:03:25;01:03:26;"- Wait, what?"
01:03:26;01:03:29;"- So he is very aware of Twiddle."
01:03:29;01:03:30;"- Wow."
01:03:30;01:03:31;"- What's Tumbledown?"
01:03:31;01:03:32;"Is that like a jam fest?"
01:03:32;01:03:33;"- That's something that Vampire Weekend"
01:03:33;01:03:34;"and Twiddle have in common."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"- Wait, there's a YouTube of it."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"Pull the YouTube up, we gotta get the audio on that."
01:03:37;01:03:39;"Native sons of Burlington, Vermont."
01:03:39;01:03:42;"- Now we know Bernie's not that into music."
01:03:42;01:03:43;"- He's not?"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"Remember Bernie's album?"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"- Oh yeah, legendary."
01:03:47;01:03:51;"When I was first introduced to Twiddle,"
01:03:51;01:03:52;"via this- - I met my good friend,"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"Trey Anastasio."
01:03:54;01:03:57;"- I said, ""Trey, you're pretty good,"
01:03:57;01:03:58;"but are you the best?"""
01:03:58;01:04:01;"And he said, ""No, I'm not the Jam Flow Man, Senator."""
01:04:01;01:04:05;"- There is a Jam Flow Man within every working family."
01:04:05;01:04:10;"- Let me thank Twiddle for saying-"
01:04:10;01:04:13;"- 2018, I love it. - Saying a few words."
01:04:13;01:04:14;"And what I wanna say-"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"- By the way, this is Twiddle's own festival."
01:04:16;01:04:20;"- I wanna say is that your generation"
01:04:20;01:04:22;"is the most progressive generation"
01:04:22;01:04:25;"in the history of this country."
01:04:25;01:04:27;"- In the history of the Twiddle fan community."
01:04:27;01:04:35;"- Your generation is helping to lead the fight"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"against racism,"
01:04:37;01:04:42;"sexism,"
01:04:42;01:04:46;"religious bigotry,"
01:04:46;01:04:50;"homophobia,"
01:04:51;01:04:52;"xenophobia,"
01:04:52;01:04:59;"and all the other phobias that Trump is trying to push out."
01:04:59;01:05:02;"- It's like one hardcore Trump/Twiddle fan,"
01:05:02;01:05:06;"just like, ""I'm out."" - Oh man, I don't like the politics."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"- I came here for Jam Flow Man."
01:05:08;01:05:09;"- That dude exists."
01:05:09;01:05:10;"- Yeah, totally."
01:05:10;01:05:11;"- There's totally a Trump Twiddle."
01:05:11;01:05:12;"- That's so brutal."
01:05:12;01:05:14;"A Trump Jamhead, that's crazy."
01:05:14;01:05:17;"I wonder if Bernie's stuck around for this show."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"- Out of there immediately."
01:05:19;01:05:20;"- Yeah, oh man."
01:05:20;01:05:23;"- I bet he hung side stage for like two."
01:05:23;01:05:24;"- Two songs?"
01:05:24;01:05:25;"- Yeah. - Two hours?"
01:05:25;01:05:26;"(laughing)"
01:05:26;01:05:28;"And as you can imagine, this is on Twiddle's account."
01:05:28;01:05:33;"It's mostly Twiddle fans, so you gotta imagine intersect."
01:05:33;01:05:34;"A Burlington-based jam has gotta intersect"
01:05:34;01:05:37;"pretty significantly with Bernie."
01:05:37;01:05:40;"So we get a lot of Bernie 2020."
01:05:40;01:05:44;"I have mixed feelings about, I'm sure you do too."
01:05:44;01:05:46;"Love the man, but 2020, yikes."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"So a lot of just like everybody,"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"""Thank you, sir, I salute you."""
01:05:52;01:05:55;"Do it for a few, so so much positive (beep)"
01:05:55;01:05:57;"and then just like add a nater."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"No, then there's like a few."
01:05:58;01:06:00;"Are these Twiddle fans or?"
01:06:00;01:06:02;"Bernie the Great Con Man."
01:06:02;01:06:04;"He's a multi-millionaire congress member"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"that talks about dreams and delivers nightmares."
01:06:06;01:06:07;"Then there's somebody."
01:06:07;01:06:08;"- How?"
01:06:08;01:06:09;"- Did he just come out of a nursing home?"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"MAGA, Trump 2020."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"- Nice, so there are those people."
01:06:13;01:06:17;"- Well, one person, washed up 1960s commie loser."
01:06:17;01:06:20;"That'd be a hilarious thing for a Twiddle fan to say."
01:06:20;01:06:21;"I don't know, yeah, I can't tell."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"- I can see it, man, some real confused,"
01:06:23;01:06:27;"like 17-year-old kid who's just up on the QAnon crap"
01:06:27;01:06:31;"and into just garbage right-wing stuff on the internet,"
01:06:31;01:06:33;"but is also like, ""Yeah, man, jam bands."""
01:06:33;01:06:34;"I can see it."
01:06:34;01:06:38;"- I'm just really into good guitar playing."
01:06:38;01:06:40;"- But like really solid musicianship."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"- Right."
01:06:41;01:06:43;"- Just looking at it in the lamest way."
01:06:43;01:06:44;"- That's brutal."
01:06:44;01:06:46;"A Trump/Twiddle fan."
01:06:46;01:06:49;"Anyway, Joker Man and Jamflow Man,"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"now we got two deities in the time crisis canon."

01:07:52;01:07:53;"(electronic music)"
01:07:53;01:07:56;"- It's time for the top five."
01:07:56;01:07:59;"F-f-f-f-f-five on iTunes."
01:07:59;01:08:02;"- Now we've been talking about the year 1999 a lot,"
01:08:02;01:08:06;"and so we're gonna compare the top five iTunes songs"
01:08:06;01:08:10;"currently to the top five Billboard hits this week in '99."
01:08:10;01:08:13;"Now ironically, the number five song in 1999"
01:08:13;01:08:17;"was by a band with a 98 in their name."
01:08:17;01:08:18;"- 98 Degrees."
01:08:18;01:08:18;"- That's right."
01:08:18;01:08:20;"Do you remember who 98 Degrees was?"
01:08:20;01:08:21;"- Boy band?"
01:08:21;01:08:22;"- 98 Degrees was a boy band."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"- I think that's all I know, really."
01:08:24;01:08:27;"- You know what's funny that I remember about 98 Degrees"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"is there were four guys in it."
01:08:29;01:08:31;"And I just remember always, and I still feel this way,"
01:08:31;01:08:33;"I'm like, four guys doesn't work for a boy band."
01:08:33;01:08:34;"- You need five."
01:08:34;01:08:35;"- Four guys is a rock band."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"- Right."
01:08:36;01:08:37;"- Boy band's gotta be five minimum."
01:08:37;01:08:40;"Even three, you could do some kind of weird trio thing."
01:08:40;01:08:43;"- Four is just like, what are you, The Beatles?"
01:08:43;01:08:46;"- Yeah, four is somebody you gotta have instruments"
01:08:46;01:08:47;"or something."
01:08:47;01:08:48;"- Yeah."
01:08:48;01:08:49;"- I just always thought there was something off about it,"
01:08:49;01:08:51;"and they never achieved the success of N'Sync"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"or the Backstreet Boys, obviously."
01:08:53;01:08:56;"- So this is really like a high watermark for boy bands."
01:08:56;01:08:58;"- Yeah, although I'm looking now that obviously"
01:08:58;01:09:01;"this was January 1999, the charts that we're looking at."
01:09:01;01:09:04;"So this song actually did come out in 1998."
01:09:04;01:09:07;"So in 1998, 98 Degrees released their album 98 Degrees"
01:09:07;01:09:08;"and Rising."
01:09:08;01:09:09;"- Solid title."
01:09:09;01:09:10;"- Solid title."
01:09:10;01:09:13;"They're going hard on the 98 thing."
01:09:13;01:09:16;"- Short-lived payoff on that."

01:17:40;01:17:42;"paved the way for modern pop."
01:17:42;01:17:43;"- Geez."
01:17:43;01:17:44;"- This is a major song."
01:17:44;01:17:45;"- Wait, okay, hold on."
01:17:45;01:17:47;"- Jake's about to be like, never heard it."
01:17:47;01:17:48;"- Give me a hint."
01:17:48;01:17:51;"- Let's see how quick, I'll give you one second."
01:17:53;01:17:54;"- Oh, Britney."
01:17:54;01:17:56;"- What's the song called?"
01:17:56;01:17:57;"- Is this the first single?"
01:17:57;01:17:59;"- I think this was her first single."
01:17:59;01:18:00;"- Is it Hit Me One More Time?"
01:18:00;01:18:01;"Is that what it's called?"
01:18:01;01:18:02;"- The song's called--"
01:18:02;01:18:03;"- Hit Me One More Time, is it?"
01:18:03;01:18:04;"- That's what she says."
01:18:04;01:18:05;"- Yeah."
01:18:05;01:18:06;"- The song's called Baby One More Time."
01:18:06;01:18:07;"- Oh, Baby, yeah."
01:18:07;01:18:10;"- And weirdly, it's dot, dot, dot, baby one more time."
01:18:13;01:18:17;"- I like that wah."
01:18:17;01:18:18;"- Yeah, I never caught that."
01:18:18;01:18:19;"- That was sick."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"- It's a funky song."
01:18:23;01:18:27;"- Hold that."
01:18:29;01:18:32;"- Whoa, sick."
01:18:32;01:18:34;"- What?"
01:18:34;01:18:35;"You never caught that little--"
01:18:35;01:18:38;"- Is there like an envelope filter on that guitar"
01:18:38;01:18:38;"or is that just a wah?"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"- That little, sounds like the Jamflow man"
01:18:40;01:18:43;"snugging to this session."
01:18:45;01:18:52;"- Ghost in the machine, dude."
01:18:52;01:18:54;"Jamflow man out of nowhere."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"- And they mix it so low."
01:18:55;01:18:56;"- Yeah."
01:18:59;01:19:01;"- I forgot this is a funky song."
01:19:01;01:19:03;"- Yeah."
01:19:03;01:19:06;"- I think of her stuff as kind of like a little stiff, but."
01:19:09;01:19:28;"- That piano part that kind of leads in"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"kind of reminds me of like Dre or something."
01:19:30;01:19:31;"- Yeah, no, totally."
01:19:34;01:19:42;"- This is one of the best selling singles of all time"
01:19:42;01:19:45;"with over 10 million copies sold."
01:19:45;01:19:47;"- I had the cassette single."
01:19:47;01:19:48;"- Did you buy it?"
01:19:48;01:19:49;"- I think someone gave it to me as like a joke."
01:19:49;01:19:51;"- Yeah, and you're like, it's pretty good."
01:19:51;01:19:53;"- Yeah, we blasted it in the car a lot."
01:19:53;01:19:55;"It was like driving up to the Fred Meyer in Portland."
01:19:58;01:20:03;"♪ Yeah, stop the way I'm driving ♪"
01:20:03;01:20:04;"- Listen to this."
01:20:04;01:20:06;"Baby One More Time was first offered to TLC"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"and they turned it down."
01:20:08;01:20:10;"TLC's T-Boz told MTV they passed on the song"
01:20:10;01:20:13;"as they felt it didn't represent the band appropriately."
01:20:13;01:20:15;"No disrespect to Britney, it's good for her,"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"but was I gonna say Hit Me Baby One More Time?"
01:20:17;01:20:18;"Hell no."
01:20:18;01:20:20;"I mean, this song's always had kind of like"
01:20:20;01:20:21;"mysterious lyrics. - Yeah, so what is this song"
01:20:21;01:20:21;"about?"
01:20:21;01:20:24;"- No, we gotta stop for a second."
01:20:24;01:20:26;"What are the goddamn lyrics to this song?"
01:20:26;01:20:29;"♪ My loneliness is killing me ♪"
01:20:29;01:20:33;"♪ And I must confess ♪"
01:20:33;01:20:34;"- I mean, maybe we low-key know all the lyrics"
01:20:34;01:20:37;"and just, they don't really leave much impression."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"They're written by Max Martin."
01:20:39;01:20:42;"- Okay, like the famous-- - Famous Swedish guy."
01:20:42;01:20:44;"Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to?"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"So again, keep in mind, he's,"
01:20:46;01:20:49;"Swedish people tend to speak English very well."
01:20:49;01:20:51;"It's still the second language."
01:20:51;01:20:53;"So they might have interesting insights"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"into our own language that we can't see"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"as native speakers."
01:20:57;01:20:59;"Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"that something wasn't right here?"
01:21:01;01:21:03;"Oh baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"and now you're out of sight, yeah."
01:21:05;01:21:06;"Show me how you want it to be."
01:21:06;01:21:09;"Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now,"
01:21:09;01:21:10;"oh because."
01:21:10;01:21:11;"My loneliness is killing me."
01:21:11;01:21:13;"I must confess I still believe"
01:21:13;01:21:15;"when I'm not with you I lose my mind."
01:21:15;01:21:16;"Give me a sign."
01:21:16;01:21:17;"Hit me baby one more time."
01:21:17;01:21:19;"Is it basically just trying to say hit me up?"
01:21:19;01:21:22;"- I never interpret it as literally like hit me,"
01:21:22;01:21:25;"like strike me with your fist."
01:21:25;01:21:25;"- Well. - I never thought"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"that was the meaning. - Apparently,"
01:21:27;01:21:28;"the record executives were nervous"
01:21:28;01:21:31;"that it might condone domestic violence."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"- Who would listen to that song and be like,"
01:21:32;01:21:33;"oh, okay, yeah."
01:21:33;01:21:34;"- Nick's saying was it a riff on"
01:21:34;01:21:37;"Hit Me With Your Best Shot by Pat Benatar?"
01:21:37;01:21:38;"- Right."
01:21:38;01:21:39;"- Although that's taking-- - Yeah, exactly,"
01:21:39;01:21:39;"that kind of thing. - But that's taking"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"like a pre-existing phrase."
01:21:41;01:21:42;"Hit me with your best shot, like."
01:21:42;01:21:45;"- I mean, maybe it is like a very dark"
01:21:45;01:21:47;"kind of masochistic song."
01:21:47;01:21:49;"Like, you know, she's upset that they've broken up"
01:21:49;01:21:52;"and she is so sort of torn up about it"
01:21:52;01:21:53;"that she's like, yeah, please,"
01:21:53;01:21:57;"like I'd rather have you punch me than not be with you."
01:21:57;01:21:59;"But then again, her image at that time"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"was of innocent schoolgirls."
01:22:01;01:22:02;"- I mean, Nick could also picture"
01:22:02;01:22:04;"you're Max Martin, you're a Swedish guy,"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"you speak English excellently,"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"but maybe the certain colloquial stuff"
01:22:08;01:22:10;"you don't have mastered, which is fair."
01:22:10;01:22:13;"- He's got Pat Benatar in the back of his mind."
01:22:13;01:22:14;"- Or even he's just like, you know,"
01:22:14;01:22:18;"this is a song about a girl who broke up with a guy"
01:22:18;01:22:19;"and now she's starting to regret it"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"and she just wishes that he would reach out to her"
01:22:21;01:22:22;"and that's what the chorus is about."
01:22:22;01:22:23;"And they're like, but why hit me?"
01:22:23;01:22:26;"He's like, you know, she's like saying, you know, hit me."
01:22:26;01:22:28;"And they're just like, what?"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"And he's like, well, yeah, when I was in the States,"
01:22:30;01:22:34;"I heard somebody say, you know, hit me on my two-way pager."
01:22:34;01:22:35;"And they're like-- - Yeah, see,"
01:22:35;01:22:36;"this is the question though."
01:22:36;01:22:38;"- And they're like, that makes sense."
01:22:38;01:22:41;"- But in '98, '99, were people saying hit me up?"
01:22:41;01:22:43;"- Oh, I think so. - Really?"
01:22:43;01:22:45;"I feel like that's a real cell phone thing."
01:22:45;01:22:47;"- Okay, wait, hold on, we found some info."
01:22:47;01:22:49;"- Like hit me up on my landline, like what?"
01:22:49;01:22:50;"- In John-- - No, it'd be like"
01:22:50;01:22:51;"give me a call."
01:22:51;01:22:54;"- You don't think people said hit me up in the '90s?"
01:22:54;01:22:55;"- I don't know, for some reason,"
01:22:55;01:22:56;"I'm struggling with this one."
01:22:56;01:22:57;"Maybe I'm completely off base,"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"but I just feel like before cell phones,"
01:22:59;01:23:01;"you weren't saying hit me up."
01:23:01;01:23:04;"But I mean, that's at least my personal experience."
01:23:04;01:23:05;"- Interesting."
01:23:05;01:23:08;"Okay, in John Seabrook's book of pop music history,"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"""The Song Machine,"" he explains that the tracks"
01:23:10;01:23:13;"Swedish writers Max Martin and Remy Jakub,"
01:23:13;01:23:14;"I guess there's another person,"
01:23:14;01:23:17;"believe that hit was American slang for call."
01:23:17;01:23:18;"- Okay."
01:23:18;01:23:20;"- And so the song about the heartache of a recent breakup"
01:23:20;01:23:21;"turned to a hit with the public,"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"perhaps a bit confused, but none the wiser."
01:23:23;01:23:24;"See, that makes sense."
01:23:24;01:23:26;"Definitely people would have said hit me on my pager"
01:23:26;01:23:28;"in the '90s. - Sure, sure."
01:23:28;01:23:30;"- People had pagers going back to the '80s."
01:23:30;01:23:33;"So imagine they come out to LA for a few months"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"of songwriting and they keep hearing people saying,"
01:23:35;01:23:38;"yeah, hit me on my pager, and then they come back to,"
01:23:38;01:23:39;"and then they're talking to each other in Swedish,"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"be like, oh, that's interesting, I never learned that,"
01:23:41;01:23:45;"that hit means like reach out to me."
01:23:45;01:23:45;"And they're like, cool."
01:23:45;01:23:47;"And then they're like, we should make a song"
01:23:47;01:23:49;"with some cool colloquial American expressions,"
01:23:49;01:23:52;"like hit me baby, and there's nobody in the room to be like,"
01:23:52;01:23:53;"hit me baby one more time,"
01:23:53;01:23:56;"doesn't come across the same way as hit me on my pager."
01:23:56;01:23:58;"And the rest is music history."
01:23:58;01:24:01;"And nobody even cared really that much one way or the other."
01:24:01;01:24:02;"It also goes to show that, you know,"
01:24:02;01:24:06;"we talked about it with shallow in the shallow."
01:24:06;01:24:07;"- Yeah."
01:24:07;01:24:08;"- Not every line in a song has to make sense."
01:24:08;01:24:10;"- It doesn't have to add up."
01:24:10;01:24:11;"- It's, you know--"
01:24:11;01:24:12;"- To make an airtight logical argument."
01:24:12;01:24:14;"- If 90% of it makes sense,"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"the other 10% is just flavor."
01:24:16;01:24:16;"- Yeah."
01:24:16;01:24:17;"- You could even make the case,"
01:24:17;01:24:21;"it's like the kind of, the Japanese wabi-sabi aesthetic,"
01:24:21;01:24:25;"that actually there's more beauty in the cracked object"
01:24:25;01:24:28;"than in the totally perfect one anyway."
01:24:28;01:24:29;"What is perfection?"
01:24:29;01:24:30;"- I feel that."
01:24:33;01:24:34;"- Remember the video--"
01:24:34;01:24:35;"- That's me, I'm off."
01:24:35;01:24:38;"- The video is she's like in high school,"
01:24:38;01:24:39;"wearing like a Catholic school outfit."
01:24:39;01:24:40;"- Right, right."
01:24:40;01:24:42;"- That was very provocative at the time."

01:26:50;01:26:53;"- And so they have to pay royalties or whatever to him?"
01:26:53;01:26:54;"- Yeah."
01:26:54;01:26:56;"- So they're just going like above board with it."

01:31:43;01:31:45;"- Yeah, in the middle ages in Italy."
01:31:45;01:31:48;"So you could also imagine a guy showing up at a convent."

01:31:50;01:31:51;"Nobody's supposed to be here."
01:31:51;01:31:56;"Oh, that'd be more like no man are supposed to be here."
01:31:56;01:31:58;"- No, yeah, that's more of like a why are you here?"
01:31:58;01:31:59;"It's not how did you get here?"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"You'd be like, I walked."
01:32:01;01:32:04;"How did you get here is such a specific thing."
01:32:04;01:32:06;"That's not something you savor."
01:32:06;01:32:07;"Like how did you get here, dude?"
01:32:07;01:32:09;"- Well, it's also a very specific combo"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"because I can think of a lot of how did you get here's"
01:32:11;01:32:15;"and I can think of a lot of nobody's supposed to be here's."
01:32:15;01:32:16;"I could think of it just like,"
01:32:16;01:32:18;"well, how'd you get here?"
01:32:18;01:32:22;"You're seven and we're 30 miles from your parents' house."
01:32:22;01:32:23;"Do they know that?"
01:32:23;01:32:24;"Would you get on the bus?"
01:32:24;01:32:25;"That's inappropriate."
01:32:25;01:32:26;"How'd you get here?"
01:32:26;01:32:28;"But the nobody's supposed to be here part,"
01:32:28;01:32:31;"I guess it's a combo of two different vibes."
01:32:31;01:32:34;"- How did you get here is like a very horror movie."
01:32:34;01:32:34;"- That's what I'm thinking."
01:32:34;01:32:37;"It's like you show up to your vacation house"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"and you're thinking it's gonna be like just you"
01:32:39;01:32:42;"and your wife and then there's like your old"
01:32:42;01:32:44;"like college friend who's standing in the living room"
01:32:44;01:32:47;"waiting for you, who you have like weird bad blood with"
01:32:47;01:32:51;"and you're like, how did you get here?"
01:32:51;01:32:54;"- But then even then nobody's supposed to be here."
01:32:54;01:32:56;"- Yeah, it's like, this is our lake house, dude."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"Like we're rolling in for the weekend."
01:32:58;01:33:00;"- Maybe like a-- - Like a stalker film."
01:33:00;01:33:02;"- Or maybe it's like a sci-fi horror movie."
01:33:02;01:33:04;"- Oh dude, like aliens?"
01:33:04;01:33:05;"- Oh, okay."
01:33:05;01:33:07;"Or it's like, did you see Annihilation?"
01:33:07;01:33:08;"- Yes."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"- And it's kind of reminded me of that old"
01:33:10;01:33:13;"the Russian movie Stalker."
01:33:13;01:33:15;"This was like about these people who enter the zone."
01:33:15;01:33:16;"- Right, right."
01:33:16;01:33:18;"- You know, so that's like a slight mini genre movies"
01:33:18;01:33:21;"where people go into this mysterious like toxic place"
01:33:21;01:33:25;"where a meteor hit or you know, there's radioactive waste"
01:33:25;01:33:26;"and no humans live there."
01:33:26;01:33:30;"So like a group of scientists enter the zone."
01:33:30;01:33:31;"- Chernobyl. - Chernobyl, basically."
01:33:31;01:33:33;"- In 1986. - Yeah, exactly."
01:33:33;01:33:35;"And then they just like go in and they see like"
01:33:35;01:33:38;"a very like healthy looking--"
01:33:38;01:33:41;"- Dude, it's just Arnold from T2, just naked."
01:33:41;01:33:43;"- Yeah, he looks like he's in great shape."
01:33:43;01:33:46;"Doesn't look like, not like some toxic waste victim."
01:33:46;01:33:47;"And they're just like, how did you get here?"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"And he just stares blankly at them."
01:33:49;01:33:51;"Nobody's supposed to be here."
01:33:51;01:33:51;"That would make sense."
01:33:51;01:33:54;"- Yeah, okay, I'm glad we got to the bottom of that."
01:33:54;01:33:57;"- The army swept this area for survivors."
01:33:57;01:34:00;"They've maintained a strict perimeter."
01:34:00;01:34:03;"This group of scientists are the first people"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"allowed in in three years."
01:34:05;01:34:06;"How did you get here?"
01:34:06;01:34:07;"Nobody's supposed to be, that tracks."
01:34:07;01:34:09;"How did you get here?"
01:34:09;01:34:14;"(laughing)"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"- And this is the credit song."
01:34:16;01:34:18;"(laughing)"
01:34:18;01:34:19;"Of this movie."
01:34:19;01:34:25;"Wildly dissonant emotional palette from the film."
01:34:25;01:34:30;"- Picture, it's 1999."
01:34:30;01:34:32;"Deborah Cox, Canadian R&B singer,"
01:34:32;01:34:33;"has this like massive hit and the label's like,"
01:34:33;01:34:36;"we wanna make a big video."
01:34:36;01:34:39;"Can we just like sit down and pitch this?"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"Deborah, pitch this."
01:34:41;01:34:42;"Love the lyrics, we wanna do something big."
01:34:42;01:34:44;"We wanna do something cinematic."
01:34:44;01:34:46;"'Cause right now you got the number two song"
01:34:46;01:34:48;"on the Billboard charts."
01:34:48;01:34:50;"Picture this, Chernobyl."
01:34:50;01:34:53;"Three years after the disaster."
01:34:53;01:34:59;"You're leading a highly trained team of scientists."
01:34:59;01:35:04;"The number two song, woo, Golden Globe winner."
01:35:04;01:35:07;"Number two song in 2019, I should say."
01:35:07;01:35:10;"Golden Globe winner, congratulations to Lady Gaga,"
01:35:10;01:35:14;"Mark Ronson, Andrew Wyatt, and Anthony Rossamando."
01:35:14;01:35:15;"- Oh, they won for the song."
01:35:15;01:35:16;"- Yep."
01:35:16;01:35:18;"- Right, the film did not win, but."
01:35:18;01:35:19;"- No, the song won."
01:35:19;01:35:21;"- The song, okay great, it's back."
01:35:21;01:35:24;"So, okay, so the Golden Globe victory."
01:35:24;01:35:25;"- Bittersweet."
01:35:25;01:35:30;"- Well, I guess it drove this song back up the charts."
01:35:30;01:35:31;"'Cause this, I don't think was on"
01:35:31;01:35:33;"the last few countdowns we did."
01:35:33;01:35:35;"- Yeah, maybe not, but it's still very successful."
01:35:35;01:35:36;"- Obviously."
01:35:36;01:35:37;"- It's a big drop, yeah."
01:35:37;01:35:39;"- But I'm just sort of surprised that people are like,"
01:35:39;01:35:42;"oh, that won the Golden Globe, I guess I'll buy it."
01:35:42;01:35:44;"- Or just remind people that it exists."

01:38:39;01:38:41;"But, and then I was thinking about it,"
01:38:41;01:38:42;"and I was like, okay, let's say the original lyric,"
01:38:42;01:38:45;"or they thought to, maybe they'd made a,"

01:47:37;01:47:38;"- Was there a movie called Sunflower?"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"- No, no, no, but this is from the soundtrack"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"to Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse."
01:47:42;01:47:44;"- Do you know anything about that movie?"
01:47:44;01:47:44;"- No."
01:47:44;01:47:46;"- People have been saying it's great, it's animated."
01:47:46;01:47:47;"- I'm out."
01:47:47;01:47:49;"I could care less about superhero movies."
01:47:49;01:47:50;"I'm so burned out."
01:47:50;01:47:51;"- Well, people say this is a different,"
01:47:51;01:47:53;"because it's animated, it's a different vibe."
01:47:53;01:47:54;"- That's even strike three."
01:47:54;01:47:57;"I mean, I don't like superhero movies"
01:47:57;01:47:58;"and I don't like animation."
01:47:58;01:48:00;"So it's like, that's tough."
01:48:00;01:48:03;"That's a tough sell for me."
01:48:03;01:48:06;"- You meet the whole new Spider-Man, Miles Morales,"
01:48:06;01:48:08;"and you realize that there's all different types"
01:48:08;01:48:11;"of spider people or something."
01:48:11;01:48:13;"- Oh, there's like a universe of Spider-Men?"
01:48:13;01:48:14;"- There's like a pig spider."
01:48:14;01:48:16;"- That sounds terrible."
01:48:16;01:48:18;"The whole thing with Spider-Man is he's unique."
01:48:18;01:48:21;"You know, he alone has these powers"
01:48:21;01:48:22;"to do these things on Earth."
01:48:22;01:48:24;"- Yeah, that was the 20th century myth."
01:48:24;01:48:25;"- Conception, man."
01:48:25;01:48:29;"- That's what the 1960s American man needed to believe in."
01:48:29;01:48:32;"- Well, I'm a '60s and '70s guy, you know that."
01:48:32;01:48:33;"- Sunflowers are known to rapidly deplete"
01:48:33;01:48:35;"their soil of nutrients."
01:48:35;01:48:36;"So that's part of it."
01:48:36;01:48:37;"Anyway."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"- Yeah, Post was doing a--"
01:48:39;01:48:40;"- Maybe."
01:48:40;01:48:41;"- Remember, we've gone--"
01:48:41;01:48:43;"- Deeply horticultural analysis of the species."
01:48:43;01:48:45;"- Well, I think Swayze wrote that part,"
01:48:45;01:48:47;"but we've gone deep on some Post lyrics,"
01:48:47;01:48:49;"and there were a lot of levels."
01:48:49;01:48:49;"- Yeah."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"- Tony Romo. - It's a cool song."
01:48:50;01:48:51;"- It is a cool song."
01:48:51;01:48:52;"I like it."
01:48:52;01:48:53;"I think you should give Spider-Man"
01:48:53;01:48:54;"into the Spider-Verse a try."
01:48:54;01:48:55;"- Have you seen it?"
01:48:55;01:48:56;"- No, but I was actually like,"
01:48:56;01:48:58;"I almost went to see it solo,"
01:48:58;01:48:59;"because I was like,"
01:48:59;01:49:01;"this seems like something I'm supposed to see."
01:49:01;01:49:02;"- Wow."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"- Maybe we should do, what did we say?"
01:49:03;01:49:04;"- Triple feature?"
01:49:04;01:49:07;"- Bohemian Rhapsody, Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse,"
01:49:07;01:49:08;"and Sound of Music."
01:49:08;01:49:10;"- Sound of Music."
01:49:10;01:49:11;"Okay, what's the order of that?"
01:49:11;01:49:12;"I think we open with Sound of Music,"
01:49:12;01:49:13;"'cause that's the sleeper."
01:49:13;01:49:14;"- Well, I think Sound of Music"
01:49:14;01:49:16;"we probably can't see in the theater."
01:49:16;01:49:18;"- Oh, well, I have a private theater."
01:49:18;01:49:19;"- Okay, we're gonna watch all of these,"
01:49:19;01:49:21;"and we'll get the screeners,"
01:49:21;01:49:22;"and watch them all in Jake's home theater?"
01:49:22;01:49:23;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:49:23;01:49:24;"- Okay."
01:49:24;01:49:25;"When are we starting?"
01:49:25;01:49:26;"Morning?"
01:49:26;01:49:26;"- Noon."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"- You got seven hours of movies ahead of you."
01:49:28;01:49:29;"We wanna start at noon?"
01:49:29;01:49:30;"- Well, once I'm in college,"
01:49:30;01:49:34;"I did a noon to noon movie fest with my--"
01:49:34;01:49:34;"- Noon to noon, meaning--"
01:49:34;01:49:35;"- Dork buddies."
01:49:35;01:49:36;"- 24 hours?"
01:49:36;01:49:37;"- Yeah."
01:49:37;01:49:38;"- And you stayed up the whole time?"
01:49:38;01:49:40;"- Yeah, we watched movies in the lounge of our dorm"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"for 24 hours, bunch of dorks."
01:49:42;01:49:43;"(laughing)"
01:49:43;01:49:44;"- Who are you?"
01:49:44;01:49:45;"- Like Evil Dead and all this stuff like that."
01:49:45;01:49:49;"- Yeah, so you took down what, like 14 movies?"
01:49:49;01:49:50;"- Something, I don't even remember."
01:49:50;01:49:51;"- What were you doing to stay awake?"
01:49:51;01:49:53;"You were just young and having--"
01:49:53;01:49:54;"- Yeah, drinking Mountain Dew."
01:49:54;01:49:55;"(laughing)"
01:49:55;01:49:58;"Being like 19, you know?"
01:49:58;01:49:59;"- Just drinking Mountain--"
01:49:59;01:50:01;"- VHS, by the way, this is like 1996 or something."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"- That's alternate universe."
01:50:02;01:50:03;"- Just like--"
01:50:03;01:50:04;"- Crushing Dew."
01:50:04;01:50:06;"- Bunch of like crappy horror movies."
01:50:06;01:50:07;"(laughing)"
01:50:07;01:50:09;"- I remember telling my friend about it."
01:50:09;01:50:11;"He's like, ""Wow, that sounds like"
01:50:11;01:50:12;"""an enormous waste of time."""
01:50:12;01:50:13;"(laughing)"
01:50:13;01:50:15;"- I mean, there's something cool about"
01:50:15;01:50:16;"if you pick the movies wisely."
01:50:16;01:50:17;"- Yeah."
01:50:17;01:50:19;"- Think about how many people have a list of like movies"
01:50:19;01:50:21;"that are like, ""Wow, yeah, I wanna see these."""
01:50:21;01:50:23;"You could probably bang out somebody's movie list"
01:50:23;01:50:25;"in one mega session."
01:50:25;01:50:28;"- Noon to noon, okay, so for our triple feature,"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"the question is when do you wanna end?"
01:50:30;01:50:34;"Maybe we start at like two or three, end at like 10."
01:50:34;01:50:35;"- And I guess we could like eat dinner"
01:50:35;01:50:37;"during the middle one?"
01:50:37;01:50:38;"- Okay."
01:50:38;01:50:39;"- This is not gonna happen."
01:50:39;01:50:42;"(laughing)"
01:50:42;01:50:43;"- Start with Sound of Music at two."
01:50:43;01:50:45;"I feel like that's probably a long movie."
01:50:45;01:50:47;"- Yeah, but it's like three hours."
01:50:47;01:50:50;"- Then at five, put in the order for Wangs."
01:50:50;01:50:51;"- Nice."
01:50:51;01:50:52;"- I mean, Wangs."
01:50:52;01:50:54;"And then I think start at Spider-Man, Spider-Verse."
01:50:54;01:50:56;"I feel like that's probably the shortest one."
01:50:56;01:50:59;"- Sound of Music, clock in at 2.54."
01:50:59;01:51:00;"- I have three hours."
01:51:00;01:51:03;"Okay, so we're watching Sound of Music first, like,"
01:51:03;01:51:03;"okay."
01:51:03;01:51:04;"- Okay, that was boring."
01:51:04;01:51:09;"- Now we put in an order for Wangs"
01:51:09;01:51:11;"and start Spider-Man and the Spider-Verse."
01:51:11;01:51:12;"That's probably a short movie."
01:51:12;01:51:13;"- It's two hours, dude."
01:51:13;01:51:14;"- Really, it's two hours?"
01:51:14;01:51:15;"Okay."
01:51:15;01:51:18;"So then halfway through Spider-Verse, the Wangs come."
01:51:18;01:51:19;"We're like chowing down, enjoying that."
01:51:19;01:51:22;"And then finally it's like darkness has descended"
01:51:22;01:51:23;"on the outside world."
01:51:23;01:51:24;"- Then we start drinking."
01:51:24;01:51:26;"- Nighttime, we crack a brew"
01:51:26;01:51:28;"and it's time for Bohemian Rhapsody."
01:51:28;01:51:30;"- Yeah, you close out with Bohemian."
01:51:30;01:51:31;"- And I feel like we're gonna like Bohemian Rhapsody"
01:51:31;01:51:32;"the most."
01:51:32;01:51:34;"Two hours, 13 minutes."
01:51:34;01:51:36;"- Damn, this is really a movie fest."
01:51:36;01:51:39;"- It's seven, yeah, pushing seven and a half."
01:51:39;01:51:40;"- It's about seven hours, damn."
01:51:40;01:51:42;"Yeah, so I like that."

01:53:31;01:53:33;"That's gonna come midway through Spider-Verse."
01:53:33;01:53:35;"- That's pretty deep in, man."
01:53:35;01:53:36;"That's like four hours in."
01:53:36;01:53:37;"- Okay, so- - So show up fed."
01:53:37;01:53:39;"- Belly's full."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"We're doing belly- - Show up fed."
01:53:41;01:53:44;"- We're doing belly, we're doing a hard 2 p.m."
01:53:44;01:53:45;"Belly's full."
01:53:45;01:53:48;"- Belly's full?"
01:53:48;01:53:51;"That's like, that's like if you're planning something"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"with like your friends like,"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"okay guys, we're going for a hike."
01:53:55;01:53:57;"I don't wanna (beep) get in the car"
01:53:57;01:53:59;"and have some guy say he's starving"
01:53:59;01:54:02;"and has to get a breakfast burrito on the way there."
01:54:02;01:54:04;"- We do that for Vampire Weekend practice a lot."
01:54:04;01:54:05;"- Belly's full?"
01:54:05;01:54:07;"- Yeah, I mean, I don't know if that comes"
01:54:07;01:54:09;"from like tour dudes being like-"
01:54:09;01:54:11;"- I'm so hungry, dude."
01:54:11;01:54:13;"- Like yeah, I don't know if it's being on tour"
01:54:13;01:54:14;"and like tour manager being like,"
01:54:14;01:54:16;"we're leaving for the airport at 3 p.m.,"
01:54:16;01:54:18;"belly's full, it's a long ride."
01:54:18;01:54:20;"Just to like let you know that there's no time to stop."
01:54:20;01:54:23;"- It's like the army or something."
01:54:23;01:54:24;"- Belly's full."
01:54:25;01:54:27;"Yeah, or just like some military dad,"
01:54:27;01:54:31;"just like we're leaving for Dave and Buster's"
01:54:31;01:54:33;"at 1 p.m., belly's full."
01:54:33;01:54:35;"I guess that's not a good example."
01:54:35;01:54:36;"There's food at Dave and Buster's."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"- Oh man."
01:54:37;01:54:39;"- Or no, you're just like some really strict dad"
01:54:39;01:54:42;"just being like, we're seeing a 3 p.m. screening"
01:54:42;01:54:44;"of Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse."
01:54:44;01:54:48;"Your mother and I will buy the tickets, but no concessions."
01:54:48;01:54:52;"So I want you, I want you in the living room."
01:54:52;01:54:53;"1.30, belly's full."
01:54:54;01:54:55;"(laughing)"
01:54:55;01:54:58;"- 13.30, belly's full."
01:54:58;01:55:00;"- We got plenty of snacks at home."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"I want you belly's full."
01:55:01;01:55:03;"(laughing)"
01:55:03;01:55:05;"Before we head to the theater."
01:55:05;01:55:07;"- We got tuna salad in the fridge, we got PB&J."
01:55:07;01:55:10;"(laughing)"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"- We got a big box of raisins."
01:55:12;01:55:16;"- Box of, belly's full, dude."
01:55:16;01:55:18;"That's a fun nugget."
01:55:18;01:55:19;"I'm gonna start using that."
01:55:19;01:55:23;"- The family is hitting a 4 p.m., a star is born."
01:55:23;01:55:26;"There will be no red vines, no milk tuts."
01:55:26;01:55:28;"Yeah, belly's full, so good."
01:55:28;01:55:32;"Those are the two main schedule things that--"
01:55:32;01:55:33;"- Yeah, that's true."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"- We joke, well, there's belly's full"
01:55:35;01:55:38;"and then the other is like hard versus soft."
01:55:38;01:55:39;"- Oh, times."
01:55:39;01:55:42;"- Yeah, we're doing a hard 2 p.m., belly's full."
01:55:42;01:55:45;"- We got a lobby call at 7 a.m., belly's full, gentlemen."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"- I guess also sometimes people say wheels up."
01:55:47;01:55:48;"- Okay, yeah."
01:55:48;01:55:50;"- Wait, what does that even come from, wheels up?"
01:55:50;01:55:51;"- Flying?"
01:55:51;01:55:52;"- That's from flying?"
01:55:52;01:55:55;"- Yeah, like we have a, there's a strict schedule here, man."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"- So that's pretty funny when people apply that"
01:55:57;01:55:58;"to things other than planes."
01:55:58;01:55:59;"- Right."
01:55:59;01:56:03;"- We're getting in the minivan, hard 2 p.m., belly's full,"
01:56:03;01:56:06;"wheels up 2 o' 5, no, actually that wouldn't make sense."
01:56:06;01:56:08;"Lobby call, 1 45, wheels up 2."
01:56:08;01:56:09;"Wheels up."
01:56:09;01:56:11;"- Belly's full, gentlemen."
01:56:11;01:56:13;"- Wheels up, we're in a van, man."
01:56:13;01:56:18;"- Wheels up is a military term when a plane lifts off"
01:56:18;01:56:20;"to start a deployment, yeah, man."
01:56:20;01:56:23;"- Okay, so I guess it's about starting your deployment."
01:56:23;01:56:24;"- Oh, 700."
01:56:24;01:56:27;"- I'm gonna do that when I take my family to the movies."
01:56:27;01:56:30;"Just be like, tickets to see a movie today cost (beep)"
01:56:30;01:56:35;"$17 and I'll be damned if I'm throwing those overpriced"
01:56:35;01:56:37;"concessions on top of it."
01:56:37;01:56:39;"We're rolling to the theater, belly's full."
01:56:39;01:56:41;"I actually think that'd be a good thing to instill"
01:56:41;01:56:43;"in the next generation too, 'cause like how many times"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"have you rolled up to the movie theater hungry,"
