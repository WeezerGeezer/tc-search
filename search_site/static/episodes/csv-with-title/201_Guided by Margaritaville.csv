00:08;00:12;"Condolences"
00:12;00:16;"to the Parrotheads and everyone who loves the great singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett."
00:16;00:20;"All this plus the greatest hits of"
00:20;00:22;"1970."
00:22;00:27;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:27;00:29;"Thank you."
00:41;00:47;"I felt probably all my rightful chances."
00:47;00:54;"My picture clear. Everything seemed so easy."
00:54;01:01;"And so I dealt you the blow. One of us had to go."
01:01;01:06;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:06;01:12;"One of us is crying. One of us is lying."
01:12;01:16;"Deep and lonely bed."
01:16;01:18;"Time crisis, back again."
01:18;01:23;"What's up fellas? We got Jake and Nick today, no Seinfeld."
01:23;01:25;"Number 201."
01:25;01:27;"201, alright."
01:27;01:29;"We made it over the 200 hump."
01:29;01:32;"So everybody's been on the road."
01:32;01:34;"I did four nights in Dayton."
01:34;01:36;"Oh, hell yeah. Where do you fly into?"
01:36;01:38;"Well, it's not easy."
01:38;01:40;"I flew into Columbus."
01:40;01:50;"I took a 545 AM flight out of LAX, which necessitated me leaving my house at 315 AM"
01:50;01:54;"to drive to the long term parking at LAX."
01:54;02:01;"I was on the shuttle to go to the airport from the parking garage at 358 AM."
02:01;02:02;"No."
02:02;02:07;"Parking shuttle was packed at 358 AM because, you know."
02:07;02:09;"Everybody was heading to Dayton."
02:09;02:11;"Everyone else was gone."
02:11;02:16;"Everyone was heading out to the GBV 40th anniversary shows in Dayton."
02:16;02:21;"So yeah, I flew to Columbus, landed there around like 1, rented a car,"
02:21;02:29;"and then just started driving around office parks and, you know, chain retail strips in Columbus."
02:30;02:36;"And kind of made my way along some kind of more rural routes through some farm country to get to Dayton."
02:36;02:39;"Wait, but real quick, Jake. I just want to rewind for a second."
02:39;02:43;"When you have a psychotically early call like that,"
02:43;02:46;"so what time were you setting your alarm to make it?"
02:46;02:52;"I set the alarm for 305 and I was out the door at 315."
02:52;02:57;"So in those 10 minutes, are you brewing a pot of coffee?"
02:57;02:59;"No, just going water."
02:59;03:02;"Did you have your clothes prepped to just throw on and run?"
03:02;03:07;"Yeah, I was a backpacked outfit for the next day for the flight."
03:07;03:15;"You went to sleep at 1130 PM in a Guided by Voices t-shirt and a fresh pair of jeans to save time."
03:15;03:19;"Up and out."
03:19;03:24;"We had actually taped episode 200 the night before."
03:24;03:25;"Right."
03:25;03:29;"So we got home at like nine or something, packed."
03:29;03:33;"Yeah, it's just like an awkward, you don't really, like, I'm also kind of a light sleeper."
03:33;03:38;"So it was an awkward night, like just like, all right, I'm going to turn off the light."
03:38;03:43;"Like, yeah, right around 11, 1130, alarm set for 305."
03:43;03:45;"Are you sleeping in a different room?"
03:45;03:50;"No, but I had everything outside the door, so I didn't even turn on the light."
03:50;03:53;"Alarm went off. I was already kind of half awake."
03:54;03:55;"Did you turn the alarm off like first ring?"
03:55;03:57;"Immediately."
03:57;04:03;"Then just like got up, just walked out of the room, closed the bedroom door, put on my clothes, like in the bathroom."
04:03;04:07;"As you slipped out the door, did you just hear half asleep Hannah say,"
04:07;04:11;"""Have a great time at the GBV 40th, Jake."""
04:11;04:14;"She said, ""The club is open."""
04:14;04:16;"I hope they play Quality of Honor."
04:17;04:22;"As we were screaming the final stages"
04:22;04:28;"Staring at the screen as the bottle rages"
04:28;04:34;"You're finally caught in the dictionary"
04:34;04:40;"Taking a firewood pass in the cemetery"
04:40;04:45;"Oh yeah, I'm going to drive my car"
04:46;04:50;"Oh yeah, I'm going to go roof the bar"
04:50;04:54;"We are the shadow of a doubt"
04:54;04:57;"We are the power of the crown"
04:57;04:59;"When did you have your first coffee?"
04:59;05:04;"So you're a shell of a man driving to the airport, feeling insane at 315."
05:04;05:11;"You know, by the time you're in, yeah, like the hardest part is just sort of anticipating the alarm going off at 305."
05:11;05:16;"And then like that sort of like nauseous early morning, like lack of sleep feeling."
05:16;05:21;"But then like I filled up my 32 ounce water bottle."
05:21;05:25;"I did an unusual move. I put in like some powdered electrolytes."
05:25;05:27;"Oh yeah, that's a good move."
05:27;05:31;"And I was just sort of like, I need a little something because I don't want to just drink coffee."
05:31;05:34;"I'm not going to brew coffee at 305 in the morning."
05:34;05:38;"And I also don't want to just like drink coffee, empty stomach style."
05:38;05:41;"I'm just going to like, I'm just going to like muscle this."
05:41;05:47;"I'm just going to like have my electrolyte water with ice in it in my water bottle."
05:47;05:48;"I'm going to get straight in the car."
05:48;05:53;"I'm going to put on 1992's Propeller album and just it's pitch black."
05:53;05:56;"I'm just going to start driving to the airport."
05:56;05:59;"You know, at that hour, it takes like maybe a half hour."
05:59;06:01;"I live 25 miles from the airport."
06:01;06:04;"I mean, that's the advantage of going at that hour."
06:04;06:06;"It's brutal, but like, man, it's easy to get there."
06:06;06:07;"You're flying."
06:07;06:11;"Like I said, I'm on the shuttle by, you know, 358."
06:11;06:13;"I get to the airport."
06:13;06:14;"Boom, I'm already checked in."
06:14;06:17;"No bags to check, two carry-ons."
06:17;06:20;"It's Spirit Airlines direct to Columbus."
06:20;06:21;"Let's go."
06:21;06:23;"So when did you finally have a coffee on the plane?"
06:23;06:30;"Yes, because when I first arrived at the gate, all the restaurants and coffee shops were still closed."
06:30;06:33;"And then there was like a coffee bean and tea leaf that opened."
06:33;06:36;"And then I like in a blink of an eye, the line was like 50 people deep."
06:36;06:38;"And I was like, uh-uh."
06:38;06:46;"So then I just got on the plane and I got one hot chocolate and one coffee in an empty cup."
06:46;06:47;"And I combined them."
06:47;06:53;"I anticipated the coffee at Spirit Airlines at like 6 a.m. being pretty rough stuff."
06:53;06:55;"And so I kind of just combined."
06:55;07:02;"I made kind of like a makeshift mocha, like half hot chocolate, half coffee, which I'll do in a pinch."
07:02;07:03;"You know, I did that."
07:03;07:08;"Right. As you say that, I recall hearing that that's one of your moves."
07:08;07:13;"When we were in the hospital for like four days when Lizzie was born and it was during COVID."
07:13;07:14;"The coffee was so bad."
07:14;07:17;"We couldn't get food from outside, you know, it was during COVID."
07:17;07:21;"And that's what I would do every day, the cocoa coffee combo."
07:21;07:27;"So yeah, I rocked the coffee, then I kind of slept, landed in Columbus at 1, got on the rental."
07:27;07:35;"Then I started texting you guys and I hit up Slob's Diner in Columbus and crushed a Greek omelet."
07:35;07:36;"Hmm."
07:36;07:37;"Set me straight."
07:37;07:39;"And then I just started shooting pictures like crazy."
07:39;07:41;"And made my way to Dayton."
07:41;07:48;"Bit of a pilgrimage, honestly, because, you know, it's like people go see like the big pink house in Saugerties."
07:48;07:56;"Or they go to Graceland in Memphis or, you know, they go to Prince's Compound, wherever that is in Minnesota."
07:56;08:03;"You know, I've had such a, like a decades long, intense fandom of Gowned By Voices."
08:03;08:06;"And so Dayton, Ohio has loomed large in my imagination."
08:06;08:08;"I'd never been there."
08:08;08:16;"And this felt like a really like significant sort of personal journey I had to take on like by myself."
08:16;08:21;"And I was really curious to like see Dayton and like obviously go to these shows."
08:21;08:25;"They're doing two hometown shows for their 40th anniversary."
08:25;08:29;"And also I was obviously going there to shoot photographs."
08:29;08:35;"So it's sort of like a work, part artwork trip and part rock and roll pilgrimage."
08:35;08:41;"I listened to a lot of early GBV driving around Dayton and exurb in Dayton."
08:41;08:49;"And just like, just kind of vibing in a way I've never done before quite with like a place and a musician."
08:49;08:53;"It sounds like probably a few people were doing that."
08:53;08:59;"You were like telling us some like fairly well-known English actor was out of the shows."
08:59;09:01;"People were like coming internationally for this."
09:01;09:06;"Yeah, yeah. So yeah, the second night I was there, Thursday night,"
09:06;09:12;"there was a GBV cover band showcase at this bar called The Yellow Cab."
09:12;09:14;"And a lot of people were doing like acoustic sets."
09:14;09:15;"I was sort of kicking myself."
09:15;09:17;"I was like, man, I wish I had been more tapped in on this community."
09:17;09:20;"I could have prepared a George Boy Voyage set."
09:20;09:24;"Because I did a couple of George Boy Voyage sets like 10 years ago."
09:24;09:27;"What I would just do acoustic Pollard songs."
09:27;09:30;"I would do like all his like 45 second songs."
09:30;09:32;"And I would just like stack them back to back."
09:32;09:36;"And then yeah, this guy, Paddy Constantine, Constadine."
09:36;09:37;"I'm not trying to say his name."
09:37;09:40;"Paddy, Paddy Constadine and his son."
09:40;09:41;"Constadine."
09:42;09:43;"Right. Yeah."
09:43;09:44;"You reckon."
09:44;09:45;"Yeah, he's in everything."
09:45;09:49;"He's in like some of the Bourne movie or one of the Bourne movies."
09:49;09:51;"He's in like one of the Game of Thrones."
09:51;09:53;"He's in the House of the Dragon."
09:53;09:55;"Yeah, he's 5'11""."
09:55;10:00;"He had the most insane Guided by Voices tattoo on his bicep."
10:00;10:05;"It was like an image of like Bob Pollard circa like 1996."
10:05;10:10;"Like, like holding a mic, but also like eating a shark or something."
10:10;10:16;"There was a little like, like a blurb about it on Stereogum, I think."
10:16;10:20;"But he was doing his set with his son."
10:20;10:21;"It was very cute."
10:21;10:22;"He like got up there."
10:22;10:24;"He's probably like my age or something, maybe a little older."
10:24;10:26;"Maybe he's pushing 50 and his son's probably like 20."
10:26;10:30;"And his son got up there and played guitar and sing harmony."
10:30;10:33;"And then Paddy Constadine being the actor he is,"
10:33;10:37;"he had the kind of like Pollard stance down."
10:37;10:38;"But they did."
10:38;10:40;"And like, yeah, it was very fun to see all the covers"
10:40;10:45;"because everyone is busting out like the deepest, the deepest stuff."
10:45;10:47;"I'm a motor away and I'm a scientist."
10:47;10:49;"It was all like real deep cuts."
10:49;10:54;"And then this band, this local Dayton band closed out the cover set with"
10:54;10:58;"they performed 1996 is Not In My Air Force,"
10:58;11:02;"which is a Pollard solo album in its entirety in order,"
11:02;11:05;"which was amazing."
11:05;11:09;"I'm a motor away and I'm a scientist."

13:56;13:58;"This is the house style of this era."
13:58;14:01;"Right. Not even particularly Ohio East."
14:01;14:05;"Something you could find in Massachusetts, California."
14:05;14:07;"Yeah. Like Austin."
14:07;14:09;"Like big brewery."
14:09;14:10;"You know. Yeah."
14:10;14:11;"Did you hit any?"
14:11;14:12;"What was on the menu?"
14:12;14:14;"They all have a couple."
14:14;14:16;"$22 loaded nacho."
14:16;14:17;"Yeah."
14:17;14:21;"I mean, the food that the place that I went to had dinner"
14:21;14:23;"was a little more elevated."
14:24;14:26;"You know, like a fancy Caesar salad."
14:26;14:28;"I'm not good at like this."
14:28;14:32;"I'm not like great at reciting details off menus."
14:32;14:33;"Yeah."
14:33;14:36;"Like, you know, just like, yeah, like a like a $19 burger"
14:36;14:42;"or, you know, fresh house made pasta with"
14:42;14:45;"and everything has a little tweak to elevate it."
14:45;14:50;"Like the burger has some kind of like relish or like blue cheese."
14:51;14:53;"Exactly. Exactly. A little bit."
14:53;14:55;"The food was good."
14:55;14:57;"I mean, yeah, it's a pretty city."
14:57;14:59;"I mean, it's walking around at night."
14:59;15:00;"It was pretty empty."
15:00;15:03;"You know, it's kind of one of those like downtowns"
15:03;15:05;"that by 10 o'clock, there's not a lot going on."
15:05;15:09;"Could you feel it in the air that this was like the GBV takeover?"
15:09;15:12;"Like, is it a small enough town that you could like"
15:12;15:14;"just walking around driving around?"
15:14;15:15;"Yes."
15:15;15:19;"You could like sense that this is like a major event."
15:20;15:21;"Well, yes and no."
15:21;15:23;"I would say after night one,"
15:23;15:25;"because they played Friday and Saturday nights"
15:25;15:27;"of Labor Day weekend."
15:27;15:31;"Friday night, I like I went to this brewery by myself,"
15:31;15:34;"had dinner and I saw some other people"
15:34;15:36;"who were clearly headed to the show."
15:36;15:38;"They were wearing merch or this thing."
15:38;15:39;"And I had that vibe."
15:39;15:40;"And what was the attitude?"
15:40;15:41;"A bunch of like 48 year old guys."
15:41;15:43;"Head nods, high fives."
15:43;15:44;"Yeah."
15:44;15:45;"Well, yeah."
15:45;15:48;"So then on Saturday after night one,"
15:49;15:51;"I was walking from my hotel to this breakfast place."
15:51;15:56;"And like I saw like like every other shirt was a GBV shirt."
15:56;15:58;"By Saturday morning, it was fully inundated."
15:58;16:00;"How big were the shows?"
16:00;16:01;"Do you have a sense of that?"
16:01;16:03;"Well, it was at the Dayton Masonic Hall,"
16:03;16:05;"which was a very interesting venue."
16:05;16:10;"I guess there's no real proper rock club in Dayton."
16:10;16:13;"I mean, my brother shares management"
16:13;16:14;"with Guided by Voices too."
16:14;16:18;"This guy, David Newgarden, has managed Guided by Voices."
16:19;16:21;"For like 30 years."
16:21;16:24;"And he's started managing my brother like a year ago."
16:24;16:26;"So I got a little bit intel of just like,"
16:26;16:27;"yeah, they had to find a venue."
16:27;16:31;"Like they were like decided to do this 40th anniversary show."
16:31;16:34;"It has to be a hometown event."
16:34;16:37;"And then it's sort of like, well, we have to find the venue."
16:37;16:39;"So the Dayton Masonic Hall,"
16:39;16:41;"I think it seats like 1,500 maybe."
16:41;16:43;"And it's seated, which I had never been to"
16:43;16:46;"a Guided by Voices show that was seated."
16:46;16:50;"There was a GA pit, which I ended up in both nights."
16:50;16:51;"How close were you?"
16:51;16:53;"Pretty close."
16:53;16:54;"Pretty close."
16:54;16:56;"Night two, I was very close."
16:56;16:59;"Night two, I caught BTS."
16:59;17:01;"They opened."
17:01;17:02;"Really?"
17:02;17:03;"Yeah."
17:03;17:05;"Built a spill."
17:05;17:06;"Yeah, BTS."
17:06;17:08;"Wow."
17:08;17:10;"And night one, Dinosaur Jr. opened."
17:10;17:11;"Oh, crazy."
17:11;17:14;"And this other band called Kiwi Jr.,"
17:14;17:16;"I met those guys and they're big TC heads."
17:16;17:17;"What's their story?"
17:17;17:19;"They're from Toronto."
17:20;17:22;"Super Bowl Sunday"
17:22;17:25;"2020"
17:25;17:28;"I did not feel well"
17:28;17:31;"Leaving the hotel"
17:31;17:34;"Said a long goodbye"
17:34;17:36;"To a big dollar bill"
17:36;17:39;"See you again at"
17:39;17:42;"The reading of the will"
17:42;17:45;"Sherwood Forest"
17:45;17:48;"Ranger retires"
17:49;17:53;"His complex and diner's on fire"
17:53;17:56;"It's not fair to be"
17:56;17:59;"Strung out on the back of your ATV"
17:59;18:01;"Throwing dead birds into the air"
18:01;18:03;"Singing ""Howdy, neighbors"""
18:03;18:06;"""How do you like my new ride?"""
18:06;18:08;"And now I can see that"
18:08;18:11;"After spending some time apart"
18:11;18:15;"Dinosaur Jr., GBV 40th, and Built a Spill."
18:15;18:17;"That's about as strong as it gets."
18:17;18:20;"I mean, that's almost like, remember"
18:20;18:23;"at the Coachella site, they did like the Big Four of metal?"
18:23;18:26;"Metallica, Slayer"
18:26;18:28;"Who are the other two?"
18:28;18:29;"Metallica, Slayer"
18:29;18:30;"Pantera?"
18:30;18:32;"Maybe Pantera, although"
18:32;18:34;"Is it Pantera? I don't know, man."
18:34;18:35;"Megadeth?"
18:35;18:36;"Oh, Megadeth, yeah."
18:36;18:39;"Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax."
18:39;18:40;"Strong."
18:40;18:43;"And yeah, they've done these like big concerts together."
18:43;18:46;"So, I mean, for that type of music,"
18:46;18:51;"is the Big Four GBV, Dino J, BTS, and Pavement?"
18:51;18:53;"Would you say that's the Big Four?"
18:53;18:55;"Yeah, I was going to say, if they got Pavement,"
18:55;18:59;"that would have really, then it would have just taken it to like this absurd kind of festival level."
18:59;19:03;"I mean, it basically, well, that would have maybe taken some of the shine away from GBV"
19:03;19:05;"and their 40th anniversary."
19:05;19:06;"Right."
19:06;19:10;"Yeah, I would say of BTS, Build a Spill,"
19:10;19:12;"and Dino J"
19:12;19:16;"are equal to smaller"
19:16;19:18;"than GBV, right?"
19:18;19:21;"I mean, I would say GBV is still selling out."
19:21;19:24;"Dinosaur Jr. probably sold more records back in the day."
19:24;19:25;"They had like a radio hit."
19:25;19:27;"I'm just thinking if you put Pavement on that bill,"
19:27;19:29;"they're just, that's a different venue."
19:29;19:30;"I mean, they're just a bigger..."
19:30;19:31;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
19:31;19:33;"It's funny just to like,"
19:33;19:36;"just make some like real half-assed Big Four"
19:36;19:39;"just to try to like create a kind of media event."
19:39;19:42;"Maybe when we're like 60,"
19:42;19:45;"we just arbitrarily choose a Big Four"
19:45;19:46;"and even some people might be like,"
19:46;19:47;"""Well, you don't belong in the Big Four."""
19:47;19:49;"Be like, ""Whatever, it was our idea."""
19:49;19:52;"Vampire Weekend, MGMT."
19:52;19:53;"The Strokes."
19:53;19:57;"See, already then you're kind of playing fast and loose"
19:57;20:00;"because they're like our generation before us."
20:00;20:02;"Vampire Weekend, Dirty Projectors."
20:02;20:03;"Well, yeah, it depends how you do it."
20:03;20:05;"Animal Collective?"
20:05;20:07;"See, honestly, there's a Big Four that we don't belong in."
20:07;20:09;"That would probably be Animal Collective,"
20:09;20:12;"Grizzly Bear, Dirty Projectors."
20:12;20:15;"And who rounds that out?"
20:15;20:19;"Like, I don't know, Fleet Foxes or St. Vincent or something?"
20:19;20:20;"Maybe Fleet Foxes,"
20:20;20:24;"but then you got another Big Four that's Fleet Foxes, Bon Iver."
20:24;20:25;"Yeah."
20:25;20:27;"Okay, how about Fleet Foxes, Bon Iver,"
20:27;20:30;"Mumford and Sons and Florence and the Machine?"
20:30;20:31;"I don't like that for my guys."
20:31;20:33;"Yeah, I don't like that for my guys."
20:33;20:35;"We might be thinking of different guys."
20:35;20:37;"Which are your guys in this scenario?"
20:37;20:40;"My guys are Fleet Foxes and Bon Iver."
20:40;20:41;"Oh, my guys are Mumford and Sons."
20:41;20:43;"Maybe I don't like that for my guys."
20:43;20:45;"What if we throw in the National?"
20:45;20:46;"We replace the National with..."
20:46;20:47;"Oh, that's the big..."
20:47;20:49;"Maybe that's the other one."
20:49;20:53;"Wait, for Dirty Projectors, the National and Co."
20:53;20:55;"It's too random."
20:55;20:58;"God, we're having a really hard time coming up with a pure Big Four."
20:58;21:01;"I mean, to return to the Dayton one,"
21:01;21:03;"it's sort of like the Big Four."
21:03;21:05;"You could just do like a Matador Records, too."
21:05;21:11;"You'd like Pavement, GBV, Liz Phair, Yola Tango."
21:11;21:12;"Yeah, that's something."
21:12;21:13;"Bounce of Bastion."
21:13;21:14;"I mean, different."
21:14;21:16;"You get into slightly different micro-generations."
21:16;21:17;"Yola Tango feels..."
21:17;21:19;"If you threw out Pavement, Yola Tango feels..."
21:19;21:24;"Now, Dinosaur Jr., BTS, Yola Tango,"
21:24;21:28;"all on different nights opening for this special GBV."
21:28;21:29;"Like, that feels clean."
21:29;21:30;"Yeah."
21:30;21:31;"There are other bands, too."
21:31;21:34;"There were kind of too many bands, to be honest."
21:34;21:35;"Nitpick."
21:35;21:39;"Because then Night 2, this band Wednesday opened."
21:39;21:40;"I like Wednesday."
21:40;21:41;"Yeah."
21:41;21:43;"Oh, that's a newer band, right?"
21:43;21:44;"Yep."
21:44;21:48;"And then this band, the Heartless Bastards, opened up, too."
21:48;21:52;"I missed the Wednesday and Heartless Bastards portion of the night"
21:52;21:56;"because I couldn't sign up for like five and a half hours worth of music."
21:56;21:58;"Yeah, you got to protect those ears."
21:58;22:00;"Yeah, because GBV is going to play for two."
22:00;22:03;"It's tough, like, crossing the generations."
22:03;22:05;"I guess, like, sometimes that works."
22:05;22:09;"But I kind of feel like, yeah, if it's like a younger band opening for an older band,"
22:09;22:11;"I guess that's kind of like time-tested."
22:11;22:13;"Yeah, I think that's cool."
22:13;22:16;"Sorry, I'm still thinking about various Big 4s."
22:16;22:17;"Big 4s?"
22:17;22:20;"There could be a Big 4 rap show."
22:20;22:23;"Jay-Z, Kanye..."
22:23;22:25;"See, you already get into these, like, funny..."
22:25;22:26;"Hmm."
22:26;22:27;"Jay-Z, Kanye..."
22:27;22:29;"Wayne?"
22:29;22:30;"Wayne."
22:30;22:32;"If you did Jay-Z, Kanye, Wayne, and Drake,"
22:32;22:34;"I think that that would be considered..."
22:34;22:37;"And I know Drake's post this, but his legacy like this."
22:37;22:39;"By the time you're talking retirement age."
22:39;22:41;"Yeah, because that would be like a massive festival."
22:41;22:44;"Honestly, it'll depend which way the wind blows"
22:44;22:46;"because you could see, no matter what,"
22:46;22:48;"Kanye, Drake, and Wayne, I think, are our three."
22:48;22:52;"And if they want to lean a little bit older, they'll go Jay-Z."
22:52;22:55;"If they want to lean a little bit younger, they'll go Travis Scott."
22:55;22:57;"We don't know how it's going to feel."
22:57;22:59;"Eminem."
22:59;23:04;"Jay-Z, Eminem, Kid Rock, and Limp Bizkit."
23:04;23:05;"Sign me up."
23:05;23:06;"The Big 4."
23:06;23:07;"That's rough."
23:07;23:10;"It's just one of those days when you don't want to wake up"
23:10;23:11;"Everything is..."
23:11;23:13;"Everybody sucks"
23:13;23:16;"You don't really know why, but you want to justify"
23:16;23:19;"If someone's head off, no human contact"
23:19;23:21;"And if you interact, your life is on contract"
23:21;23:24;"You best bet if you stay away, mother..."
23:24;23:26;"It's just one of those days"
23:26;23:30;"It's all about the he says, she says, bullshit"
23:30;23:33;"I think you better quit, let's slip"
23:33;23:35;"Or you're gonna leave with a fat lip"
23:35;23:38;"It's all about the he says, she says, bullshit"
23:38;23:41;"I think you better quit, talk of that..."
23:41;23:44;"I want to go back to Vampire Weekend"
23:44;23:49;"20, 30 year anniversary in New York"
23:49;23:50;"40th anniversary"
23:50;23:53;"40th anniversary, 40th anniversary, three nights"
23:53;23:55;"Who's opening up for you each night?"
23:55;23:57;"What was happening in 1983?"
23:57;23:59;"The band formed?"
23:59;24:02;"Yeah, their first release was '86"
24:02;24:05;"But the band formed in '83"
24:05;24:06;"Oh wait, that's interesting"
24:06;24:09;"'Cause Vampire Weekend formed in '06"
24:09;24:12;"So that means our 40th anniversary would be 2046"
24:12;24:15;"Which is also a Wong Kar-wai film"
24:15;24:16;"I like it"
24:16;24:19;"If he's still around, maybe we could link up with him"
24:19;24:20;"He'll do the concert footage"
24:20;24:22;"Yeah, Wong Kar-wai"
24:22;24:24;"A thousand years old"
24:24;24:27;"So it's 2046"
24:27;24:30;"I don't know, it's not Mercury Lounge"
24:30;24:31;"Where it would be"
24:31;24:32;"But you're gonna go back"
24:32;24:35;"And you're gonna have a three nights of BW"
24:35;24:38;"Who are you asking to open up for you?"
24:38;24:40;"Or who is, you know"
24:40;24:43;"What does Brian Cross think is best for the boys?"
24:43;24:46;"Well I think we'd want to have"
24:46;24:47;"Well obviously the best thing to do"
24:47;24:49;"Is not worry about like selling tickets"
24:49;24:53;"By putting together like a killer nostalgia bill"
24:53;24:54;"Of course what I'd want"
24:54;24:57;"I want f***ing Mountain Brews"
24:58;24:59;"Despot"
24:59;25:01;"Tabor's Choice"
25:01;25:03;"You know, we want like the whole extended"
25:03;25:04;"Local"
25:04;25:05;"Yeah, we want"
25:05;25:06;"You're thinking more"
25:06;25:08;"You're thinking the BW family affair"
25:08;25:11;"The universe more than the"
25:11;25:12;"I think so"
25:12;25:13;"Your extended universe"
25:13;25:15;"But then if my guys come"
25:15;25:16;"Or saying like"
25:16;25:18;"No, we gotta move these tickets"
25:18;25:20;"We need to really beef up"
25:20;25:22;"People are traveling to New Jersey"
25:22;25:25;"At this point Richard Pictures is also enormous"
25:25;25:27;"So, I don't know"
25:27;25:28;"At that point maybe Richard Pictures"
25:28;25:30;"Has become the Grateful Dead"
25:30;25:34;"Richard Pictures is doing"
25:34;25:36;"Three nights at Dick's Sporting Goods"
25:36;25:38;"In Colorado"
25:38;25:40;"We'd love to make it work Ezra"
25:40;25:42;"But we just, our touring schedule"
25:42;25:43;"Is just too intense"
25:43;25:44;"It's too demanding"
25:44;25:46;"John Mayer's opening for us"
25:46;25:49;"Yeah, I guess it depends if we want to do"
25:49;25:50;"Like a"
25:50;25:52;"We've never been an easy fit"
25:52;25:54;"It's always like somewhat awkward"
25:54;25:56;"When I think about"
25:56;25:57;"Because actually when I think about"
25:57;25:58;"Like a really strong tour"
25:58;25:59;"I just had a thought"
25:59;26:01;"I'd love to round this one out"
26:01;26:04;"But somebody said The Strokes earlier"
26:04;26:05;"For a big four"
26:05;26:07;"This one is starting to feel exciting to me"
26:07;26:09;"And I'm actually just going to invest"
26:09;26:11;"In this one as a promoter"
26:11;26:13;"I'm going to put my life savings into this"
26:13;26:15;"And try to get this one off the ground"
26:15;26:16;"The Strokes"
26:16;26:18;"Kings of Leon"
26:18;26:20;"Phoenix"
26:20;26:22;"Arctic Monkeys"
26:22;26:24;"Maybe Arctic Monkeys"
26:24;26:25;"They're too big"
26:25;26:26;"Maybe they're on their own trip"
26:26;26:28;"But there's something I like about that"
26:28;26:30;"Because it's The Strokes"
26:30;26:32;"Classic New York rock band"
26:32;26:34;"Kings of Leon"
26:34;26:37;"Southern fried rock band from the same era"
26:37;26:39;"Phoenix, French"
26:39;26:41;"Arctic Monkeys, English"
26:41;26:43;"Four iconic regions"
26:43;26:45;"Represented through the power of rock and roll"
26:45;26:46;"That feels strong"
26:46;26:47;"And you know like"
26:47;26:48;"If I'm honest"
26:48;26:50;"VW's not a great fit in there"
26:50;26:52;"We could hold it down"
26:52;26:53;"We could put together a slight"
26:53;26:55;"Maybe a rockier set"
26:55;26:57;"That feels like an interesting big four tour"
26:57;26:58;"Yeah, it's really intense"
26:58;27:00;"Does each band play like an hour?"
27:00;27:01;"You have like a four hour"
27:01;27:03;"Of just music plus the turnover"
27:03;27:05;"You're looking at like a five hour show"
27:05;27:06;"At the minimum"
27:06;27:07;"I think"
27:07;27:08;"It's brutal"
27:08;27:09;"There's always ends up"
27:09;27:11;"Someone ends up being the headliner"
27:11;27:13;"And they play for like two hours"
27:13;27:15;"Metallica plays for two hours"
27:15;27:16;"Yeah, exactly"
27:16;27:18;"And even I'm looking at some of the big four branding"
27:18;27:20;"It says Metallica real big"
27:20;27:21;"And then it says"
27:21;27:23;"Slayer, Anthrax, Megadeth"
27:23;27:24;"Smaller underneath"
27:24;27:26;"Like there's a pretty big gulf"
27:26;27:28;"Between slot number one"
27:28;27:29;"And two through four"
27:29;27:31;"Where's the White Stripes fit into"
27:31;27:33;"This big four?"
27:33;27:34;"Well the White Stripes"
27:34;27:36;"They were"
27:36;27:37;"Absolutely"
27:37;27:39;"They had a kind of a synergy with the Strokes"
27:39;27:41;"Because they came out at the same time"
27:41;27:43;"And I remember in that era"
27:43;27:45;"Probably like 2002"
27:45;27:47;"Maybe 2003"
27:47;27:49;"There were a series of shows"
27:49;27:50;"Maybe it was just two shows"
27:50;27:51;"But it was"
27:51;27:53;"White Stripes opening for the Strokes"
27:53;27:54;"In New York"
27:54;27:56;"And then the Strokes opening for"
27:56;27:58;"White Stripes in Detroit"
27:58;27:59;"Which I remember at the time"
27:59;28:00;"Like hearing about that"
28:00;28:01;"And being like"
28:01;28:02;"Oh that's pretty tight"
28:02;28:03;"I like that"
28:03;28:04;"You know two bands"
28:04;28:05;"But you know the White Stripes"
28:05;28:06;"Don't exist anymore"
28:06;28:08;"Obviously Jack White still tours"
28:08;28:09;"You know to take it full circle"
28:09;28:10;"In that era"
28:10;28:11;"I remember GBV and the Strokes"
28:11;28:13;"Playing a bunch of shows together too"
28:13;28:14;"Oh yeah"
28:14;28:15;"Yeah the Strokes"
28:15;28:16;"They did some like New Year's shows"
28:16;28:18;"I honestly don't know who opened"
28:18;28:20;"I would assume GBV opened"
28:20;28:21;"That was kind of like the Strokes"
28:21;28:23;"Being this like hot new band"
28:23;28:24;"You know paying some respect"
28:24;28:26;"To their elders"
28:26;28:28;"Yeah I'm not sure about that"
28:28;28:29;"That's interesting"
28:29;28:31;"The truth is with this conversation"
28:31;28:32;"I can't get too deep"
28:32;28:34;"I'd get a little bit inside baseball"
28:34;28:35;"And also I'd have to say"
28:35;28:37;"Too many provocative things"
28:37;28:38;"If I really started going"
28:38;28:39;"Going through all my thoughts"
28:39;28:41;"About all the bands from our era"
28:41;28:42;"And who we want to tour with"
28:42;28:43;"But the one thing I know for sure"
28:43;28:45;"Ezra as show promoter"
28:45;28:46;"Yeah if I"
28:46;28:47;"It's a time crisis"
28:47;28:48;"Just goes like full mask"
28:48;28:49;"Off music business"
28:49;28:50;"I'll be like they're not worth"
28:50;28:52;"They're not worth sh*t"
28:52;28:54;"I don't give a f*ck about Chicago man"
28:54;28:55;"I don't give a f*ck"
28:55;28:56;"How good the reviews are"
28:56;28:57;"For that record man"
28:57;28:58;"They're not selling tickets"
28:58;28:59;"Those are the facts"
28:59;29:01;"No I don't like that for my guys"
29:01;29:03;"But no matter what I think"
29:03;29:04;"I would just"
29:04;29:05;"Yeah I would hope it's not"
29:05;29:06;"For a long time"
29:06;29:07;"That we do that kind of like"
29:07;29:09;"Nostalgia package"
29:09;29:10;"Although when people"
29:10;29:11;"When it feels right"
29:11;29:13;"Those tours are great"
29:13;29:14;"When it doesn't feel like"
29:14;29:16;"Some try hard like"
29:16;29:17;"You know did I say on the show"
29:17;29:18;"How I saw"
29:18;29:19;"I went to the culture club"
29:19;29:20;"At the Hollywood Bowl"
29:20;29:22;"Yeah"
29:22;29:23;"And maybe not on the show"
29:23;29:24;"But yeah you sent us photos"
29:24;29:26;"I think it was after 200"
29:26;29:27;"And that was a great vibe"
29:27;29:29;"Actually culture club crushed it"
29:29;29:31;"And the opener was Berlin"
29:31;29:33;"That felt like a little random"
29:33;29:34;"It was just kind of like"
29:34;29:35;"80s fest"
29:35;29:36;"Sure"
29:36;29:37;"And all due respect to Berlin"
29:37;29:39;"Terry Nunn's got a great voice"
29:39;29:41;"She came out at the end"
29:41;29:42;"Of culture club set"
29:42;29:44;"And did a cover of"
29:44;29:46;"Bang a Gong by T-Rex"
29:46;29:47;"Tight"
29:47;29:48;"Interesting surprise"
29:48;29:50;"But one I couldn't help"
29:50;29:52;"But think because as I walked in"
29:52;29:53;"I saw you I see sitting in"
29:53;29:54;"One of the iconic boxes"
29:54;29:55;"At the Hollywood Bowl"
29:55;29:58;"But another 80s iconic"
29:58;30:00;"Brit British singer"
30:00;30:01;"Not Boy George"
30:01;30:02;"But Morrissey"
30:02;30:04;"Just sitting there"
30:04;30:06;"Watching the show"
30:06;30:07;"He was just watching the show"
30:07;30:09;"And it was kind of like a buzz"
30:09;30:10;"Like we sat down"
30:10;30:11;"And like even the people next to us"
30:11;30:12;"Just making conversation"
30:12;30:13;"Like you see Morrissey's here"
30:13;30:14;"And I was like I did see"
30:14;30:15;"Morrissey was here"
30:15;30:17;"And you know they're kind of like"
30:17;30:18;"People probably in their 40s"
30:18;30:19;"And they were just going on like"
30:19;30:21;"Wow"
30:21;30:22;"Is he going to go on stage"
30:22;30:23;"And I was like I don't think so"
30:23;30:24;"He's like sitting in the crowd"
30:24;30:26;"I don't think he's about to go on stage"
30:26;30:28;"And Boy George made a lot of references"
30:28;30:31;"To the fact that Morrissey was there"
30:31;30:33;"And I don't know for sure"
30:33;30:35;"But I assume Morrissey left early"
30:35;30:37;"I bet he felt a little bit uncomfortable"
30:37;30:38;"Was he making references"
30:38;30:40;"That he was psyched that Morrissey was here"
30:40;30:43;"Or was there some aggression"
30:43;30:45;"I wouldn't say aggression"
30:45;30:47;"But you know Boy George"
30:47;30:50;"He's you know an absolute legend"
30:50;30:52;"But he's got his kind of like cheeky wink"
30:52;30:53;"In the way he says stuff"
30:53;30:54;"So he's kind of like"
30:54;30:56;"Morrissey's here"
30:56;30:58;"And he said it like a few times"
30:58;30:59;"That almost felt a little bit"
30:59;31:01;"Just like I see you Morrissey"
31:01;31:02;"Definitely not like dissing him"
31:02;31:03;"But just kind of"
31:03;31:04;"Like he at some point"
31:04;31:05;"He's like all right"
31:05;31:08;"I'll shut up about Morrissey soon"
31:08;31:09;"And then he even you know"
31:09;31:10;"He clearly was a Smiths fan"
31:10;31:11;"He dropped a few references"
31:11;31:12;"He was like"
31:12;31:14;"You know I had a dream the other night"
31:14;31:15;"I dreamed last night"
31:15;31:16;"That somebody loved me"
31:16;31:18;"Just like making kind of like"
31:18;31:20;"Deep Smiths references"
31:20;31:22;"Then he was talking about"
31:22;31:23;"You know I saw Morrissey on stage"
31:23;31:24;"The other day"
31:24;31:26;"He kept talking about him"
31:26;31:28;"And I felt like maybe he was"
31:28;31:29;"Not being aggressive"
31:29;31:30;"But maybe just like"
31:30;31:32;"Riling him up a little bit"
31:32;31:33;"2020"
31:33;31:36;"July 21st 2020"
31:36;31:38;"Boy George tweets out"
31:38;31:39;"I love Morrissey"
31:39;31:41;"I hate Morrissey"
31:41;31:42;"Whoa okay"
31:42;31:43;"There you go"
31:43;31:44;"So Morrissey must just be"
31:44;31:46;"Like a big culture club fan"
31:46;31:48;"I wonder"
31:48;31:49;"Just like I'm gonna go"
31:49;31:51;"I'm not gonna like"
31:51;31:52;"Be backstage"
31:52;31:54;"Or watching from like the side stage"
31:54;31:55;"I'm just gonna like go"
31:55;31:57;"And like sit in a box"
31:57;31:59;"At the Hollywood Bowl"
31:59;32:00;"That's tight"
32:00;32:02;"Yeah and you never know with Morrissey"
32:02;32:04;"He famously is very opinionated"
32:04;32:07;"Got like really strong feelings about stuff"
32:07;32:08;"I mean the culture club"
32:08;32:10;"The singles are undeniable"
32:10;32:12;"And of course I got obsessed"
32:12;32:13;"With culture club after the show"
32:13;32:14;"And listening to those songs"
32:14;32:16;"Over and over again"
32:16;32:17;"You would hope that"
32:17;32:19;"Even if Morrissey was a bit of a hater"
32:19;32:21;"How could you hear like"
32:21;32:23;"Do you really want to hurt me"
32:23;32:25;"And not recognize that"
32:25;32:27;"That's just like a classic song"
32:27;32:28;"Yeah"
32:28;32:32;"Give me time"
32:32;32:39;"To realize my crimes"
32:39;32:49;"Let me love and steal"
32:49;32:53;"I have danced"
32:53;33:00;"Inside your fire"
33:00;33:07;"How can I be real"
33:07;33:17;"Do you really want to hurt me"
33:17;33:21;"Do you really want to make me cry"
33:21;33:26;"Precious kisses words that burn me"
33:26;33:31;"Lovers never ask you why"
33:31;33:36;"In my heart the fire is burning"
33:36;33:40;"Choose my color find the star"
33:40;33:45;"Precious people always tell me"
33:45;33:50;"That's a step I stand too far"
33:50;33:51;"So they are friends"
33:51;33:52;"They are friends"
33:52;33:53;"No clearly they know each other"
33:53;33:55;"But not always"
33:55;33:57;"Boy George"
33:57;33:59;"Here's Boy George speaking"
33:59;34:01;"And he says"
34:01;34:03;"I met Morrissey in 1983"
34:03;34:04;"It was hilarious"
34:04;34:05;"I had tea with him in Paris"
34:05;34:06;"And he hated me"
34:06;34:07;"He didn't speak"
34:07;34:09;"And so I got really nervous"
34:09;34:10;"And I just went into verbal overdrive"
34:10;34:12;"For the whole hour I was there"
34:12;34:14;"When I left he said"
34:14;34:16;"Boy George is overbearing"
34:16;34:20;"Well I wish I could be a fly out of the wall"
34:20;34:22;"At that Parisian cafe"
34:22;34:23;"For that conversation"
34:23;34:25;"I briefly was backstage after the show"
34:25;34:27;"And I had one second with Boy George"
34:27;34:29;"And I was just like"
34:29;34:30;"And I asked him"
34:30;34:32;"He actually said that about the meeting in France"
34:32;34:33;"Because I was like"
34:33;34:34;"Wait so yeah I saw Morrissey there"
34:34;34:35;"Are you guys friends"
34:35;34:36;"And he's like you know"
34:36;34:38;"We've known each other since early days"
34:38;34:39;"We worked with some of the same people"
34:39;34:41;"40 years"
34:41;34:42;"Paris in the early days"
34:42;34:44;"When we were kind of like blowing up"
34:44;34:45;"And I was like oh what was that like"
34:45;34:46;"And he was like"
34:46;34:48;"Oh he was absolutely vile"
34:48;34:50;"And he was"
34:50;34:52;"But he was like"
34:52;34:53;"I don't give a sh*t"
34:53;34:54;"I love the Smiths"
34:54;34:56;"He had a great attitude"
34:56;34:58;"He was just like so funny about it"
34:58;34:59;"Just kind of like"
34:59;35:00;"Oh yeah like"
35:00;35:01;"So anyway that kind of"
35:01;35:03;"That all tracks with kind of his"
35:03;35:06;"Clearly he was excited that he was there"
35:06;35:08;"And he clearly had a lot of respect for him"
35:08;35:10;"But he couldn't help a little bit of just like"
35:10;35:12;"Hey Morrissey"
35:13;35:13;"In the crowd"
35:13;35:15;"Just I'm sure Morrissey just didn't want"
35:15;35:17;"Everybody"
35:17;35:18;"And as when I walked past me"
35:18;35:19;"Kind of a serious look on his face"
35:19;35:20;"Taking it all in"
35:20;35:22;"But I brought that up"
35:22;35:24;"I couldn't help but think about"
35:24;35:26;"Yeah how different things are contextualized"
35:26;35:27;"Berlin plus Culture Club"
35:27;35:28;"And it was fun"
35:28;35:29;"It was a great vibe"
35:29;35:30;"But it was you know"
35:30;35:32;"That's like 80s nostalgia fest"
35:32;35:34;"But if I was a promoter"
35:34;35:36;"I'd get a Morrissey"
35:36;35:38;"Culture Club"
35:38;35:39;"I don't know"
35:39;35:40;"Cure"
35:40;35:41;"Let me ask you this"
35:42;35:44;"Is it unavoidably a nostalgia fest"
35:44;35:45;"In your eyes"
35:45;35:47;"If you have bands"
35:47;35:48;"Who were at their apex"
35:48;35:50;"From all from the same era"
35:50;35:51;"Grouped together"
35:51;35:53;"What if Berlin didn't play"
35:53;35:54;"And was just a Culture Club show"
35:54;35:55;"And they had"
35:55;35:57;"Is Beirut still a band"
35:57;35:58;"Like just some band"
35:58;36:00;"Like some band from a different era"
36:00;36:01;"It's like"
36:01;36:02;"Beirut opening for Culture Club"
36:02;36:04;"Or would that not move tickets"
36:04;36:05;"And that's"
36:05;36:06;"That's a great question"
36:06;36:07;"I mean I guess it's all contextual"
36:07;36:09;"And as Time Crisis"
36:09;36:11;"Starts a promotion company"
36:11;36:12;"And they start putting together"
36:12;36:14;"High level tours"
36:14;36:15;"We have to think about these things"
36:15;36:18;"Because I think Culture Club"
36:18;36:20;"Because Boy George"
36:20;36:21;"Is so iconic"
36:21;36:23;"With the fashion"
36:23;36:24;"And he was kind of"
36:24;36:25;"One of the first of his kind"
36:25;36:26;"And you know"
36:26;36:27;"Talking openly"
36:27;36:29;"About gender"
36:29;36:30;"And playing with gender"
36:30;36:31;"You know"
36:31;36:32;"I went back"
36:32;36:33;"And watched all these like"
36:33;36:34;"Interviews with him"
36:34;36:35;"On like Letterman and stuff"
36:35;36:36;"And you know"
36:36;36:37;"He was like totally on some"
36:37;36:38;"Everybody"
36:38;36:39;"And he's on Johnny Carson"
36:39;36:40;"In like '83"
36:40;36:41;"And Johnny Carson's like"
36:41;36:42;"It's crazy"
36:42;36:43;"Johnny Carson's like"
36:43;36:44;"Now Boy George"
36:44;36:46;"And to Carson's credit"
36:46;36:47;"He's like trying to be open minded"
36:47;36:48;"But he's like"
36:48;36:49;"Now Boy George"
36:49;36:50;"I'm from a place"
36:50;36:51;"That we call"
36:51;36:52;"The Heartland"
36:52;36:53;"I'm from Nebraska"
36:53;36:55;"And you know"
36:55;36:56;"Where I come from"
36:56;36:57;"If a father came down"
36:57;36:58;"And he saw his son"
36:58;36:59;"Dressed like you"
36:59;37:01;"It would be a bit of a problem"
37:01;37:02;"I'm not saying that's right"
37:02;37:04;"But that's how it would go down"
37:04;37:05;"You know"
37:05;37:06;"Where I'm from"
37:06;37:07;"You know"
37:07;37:08;"What are your parents thinking"
37:08;37:09;"Boy George is like"
37:09;37:10;"My parents love me"
37:10;37:11;"I'm not different from them"
37:11;37:12;"But they love me"
37:12;37:13;"And you know"
37:13;37:14;"What are you going to do"
37:14;37:15;"Everybody's wearing a costume"
37:15;37:16;"He just had all these"
37:16;37:17;"Like good one liners"
37:17;37:18;"And Carson is kind of with him"
37:18;37:19;"He's like"
37:19;37:20;"Hey"
37:20;37:21;"God bless you"
37:21;37:22;"Kind of energy"
37:22;37:23;"Hey I've been in showbiz"
37:23;37:24;"A long time"
37:24;37:25;"I've seen it all"
37:25;37:26;"Yeah there was a little bit"
37:26;37:27;"Of that vibe"
37:27;37:28;"But anyway"
37:28;37:29;"I think because Boy George"
37:29;37:30;"Is so iconically '80s"
37:30;37:31;"They're one of like"
37:31;37:33;"The great '80s hit makers"
37:33;37:35;"So it's so easy to make"
37:35;37:36;"Get some other people"
37:36;37:38;"Big fat '80s hits"
37:38;37:39;"And that is going to be"
37:39;37:40;"You know you're going to have"
37:40;37:41;"A good time"
37:41;37:42;"You know it's going to be"
37:42;37:43;"The energy is going to be good"
37:43;37:44;"And maybe there's somebody"
37:44;37:45;"Who's not a huge"
37:45;37:46;"Like music fan"
37:46;37:48;"But who's"
37:48;37:49;"Who's like"
37:49;37:50;"Oh yeah that reminds me of like"
37:50;37:51;"You know when I was watching MTV"
37:51;37:52;"When I was"
37:52;37:53;"You know"
37:53;37:54;"12"
37:54;37:55;"Back then"
37:55;37:56;"They might not know"
37:56;37:57;"Culture Club Deep Cuts"
37:57;37:58;"But they're like"
37:58;37:59;"Oh yeah"
37:59;38:00;"And in Berlin"
38:00;38:01;"They did Take My Breath Away"
38:01;38:02;"I don't know"
38:02;38:03;"Maybe they're just going to be"
38:03;38:04;"Kind of psyched about that"
38:04;38:05;"Whereas"
38:05;38:06;"I don't know"
38:06;38:07;"If you wanted to"
38:07;38:08;"For either of those bands"
38:08;38:09;"I guess"
38:09;38:10;"If you wanted to like"
38:10;38:11;"Re-contextualize Culture Club"
38:11;38:13;"For like a younger generation"
38:13;38:15;"Maybe you would try to pair them"
38:15;38:16;"With somebody young"
38:16;38:17;"Because it would like"
38:17;38:18;"Resonate in a way"
38:18;38:19;"Or I don't know"
38:19;38:21;"Like half the Culture Club set"
38:21;38:23;"Is like dubbed out reggae"
38:23;38:24;"You know because like"
38:24;38:25;"They obviously did a bunch of reggae"
38:25;38:27;"Like Do You Really Want to Hurt Me"
38:27;38:28;"And there's like a"
38:28;38:29;"Boy George version"
38:29;38:31;"Reggae version of"
38:31;38:33;"That Bread song"
38:33;38:37;"Donna's everything I own"
38:37;38:39;"I did my work"
38:39;38:40;"And so there's like"
38:40;38:41;"All these times"
38:41;38:42;"They're just kind of like"
38:42;38:43;"Dubbing it out"
38:43;38:44;"And it was like"
38:44;38:45;"So I don't know"
38:45;38:46;"You could even do some like"
38:46;38:47;"Crazy Culture Club tour"
38:47;38:49;"With like some dance hall artists"
38:49;38:50;"Or something"
38:50;38:51;"You know it just depends"
38:51;38:52;"What kind of like vibe"
38:52;38:53;"You want to put"
38:53;38:54;"But then certain packages"
38:54;38:55;"Are probably going to sell"
38:55;38:56;"More tickets than others"
38:56;38:57;"Well I think in Dayton"
38:57;38:58;"They kind of like"
38:58;38:59;"Yeah went kind of both ways"
38:59;39:00;"With it"
39:00;39:01;"Getting some icons"
39:01;39:02;"From the 90s"
39:02;39:04;"And then getting some younger bands"
39:04;39:06;"Kiwi Jr. and Wednesday"
39:06;39:07;"Well honestly"
39:07;39:08;"That sounds like a great mix"
39:08;39:09;"Actually"
39:09;39:09;"And I'll just say this"
39:09;39:10;"To close the loop"
39:10;39:11;"On the Dayton trip"
39:11;39:12;"Is that"
39:12;39:13;"Because you know"
39:13;39:14;"I don't like"
39:14;39:15;"I don't like that for my guys"
39:15;39:16;"Just you talking about it"
39:16;39:17;"Like it's a nostalgia tour"
39:17;39:18;"Because I would say"
39:18;39:19;"Built to Spill"
39:19;39:20;"Played a lot of new material"
39:20;39:21;"And it's a GBV"
39:21;39:22;"It was probably like"
39:22;39:23;"Half new material"
39:23;39:24;"No"
39:24;39:25;"And I think that sounds"
39:25;39:26;"Like an example of"
39:26;39:27;"When it's right it's right"
39:27;39:28;"Yeah"
39:28;39:29;"It's not just like"
39:29;39:30;"Putting a bunch of bands together"
39:30;39:31;"Just because they're from"
39:31;39:32;"The same era"
39:32;39:34;"That's the cream of the crop"
39:34;39:35;"Dino J and BTS"
39:35;39:36;"That's right"
39:36;39:37;"Yep"
39:37;39:38;"And that's great"
39:38;39:39;"That they're playing new material"
39:39;39:41;"I bet that was the perfect crowd"
39:41;39:42;"To play new material too"
39:42;39:43;"Oh yeah"
39:43;39:44;"I mean obviously"
39:44;39:47;"Don't you know what you wanna see"
39:47;39:50;"When my heat's playing the tricks on me"
39:50;39:53;"I won't share 'cause you never know"
39:53;39:55;"I'm gonna lose your mind"
39:55;39:57;"Gonna lose your mind"
39:57;40:01;"Why can't we more like a story to read"
40:01;40:03;"And be in our house"
40:03;40:05;"And together in our dreams"
40:05;40:08;"All I was done was that kind of fun"
40:08;40:09;"I'm gonna lose your mind"
40:09;40:11;"Gonna lose your mind"
40:11;40:13;"Now you know"
40:13;40:15;"That's what you know"
40:15;40:16;"Yeah you know"
40:16;40:18;"That's what you know"
40:18;40:20;"Yeah you know"
40:20;40:24;"That's what you know"
40:24;40:25;"I will also say"
40:25;40:27;"I got some quality time in"
40:27;40:28;"With a friend of the show"
40:28;40:29;"Steven Heiden"
40:29;40:30;"Nice"
40:30;40:32;"Steven made the trip to Dayton"
40:32;40:33;"He was there with some old"
40:33;40:34;"College buddies of his"
40:34;40:36;"And we had a fun"
40:36;40:38;"Hang at a bar"
40:38;40:39;"Before night two"
40:39;40:41;"Now is"
40:41;40:43;"The same way that probably"
40:43;40:45;"If you went to like a multi-day"
40:45;40:47;"Fish festival"
40:47;40:49;"Odds are you probably need to take"
40:49;40:51;"Some type of psychedelic"
40:51;40:52;"Assuming you're not"
40:52;40:54;"On the wagon"
40:54;40:56;"You know because that's the culture"
40:56;40:57;"And maybe even helps you unlock"
40:57;40:59;"Something about yourself"
40:59;41:01;"And the moment and the community"
41:01;41:04;"At a Guided by Voices multi-day event"
41:04;41:06;"Like you knew was on the menu"
41:06;41:07;"That you're getting hammered"
41:07;41:08;"A younger version of myself"
41:08;41:10;"Probably would have gotten hammered"
41:10;41:11;"I did not get hammered"
41:11;41:12;"I will say this"
41:12;41:13;"In the beautiful"
41:13;41:14;"Dayton Masonic Hall"
41:14;41:16;"Which is this ornate"
41:16;41:18;"Building from a hundred years ago"
41:18;41:20;"Just a prime example of"
41:20;41:22;"Architecture from another era"
41:22;41:24;"When care and detail"
41:24;41:26;"And aesthetics were prioritized"
41:26;41:27;"So highly"
41:27;41:29;"Like Miller Lite maybe had like"
41:29;41:30;"Sponsored the show or something"
41:30;41:31;"That is kind of the unofficial"
41:31;41:32;"GVV beaker"
41:32;41:34;"There were just these like"
41:34;41:36;"Illuminated Miller Lite signs"
41:36;41:38;"All over this beautiful"
41:38;41:39;"Ornate"
41:39;41:40;"I started to crack myself up"
41:40;41:41;"That for some reason"
41:41;41:43;"Kidrock hates Guided by Voices"
41:43;41:44;"And he posts a video of him"
41:44;41:46;"With just like stacks of Miller Lite"
41:46;41:48;"And his f***ing AR-15"
41:48;41:49;"Like brrraaah"
41:49;41:50;"And just like"
41:50;41:52;"That's what I f***ing think about"
41:52;41:53;"Guided by Voices"
41:53;41:54;"That's what I think of"
41:54;41:56;"That mid-90s lo-fi"
41:56;41:57;"Indie rock"
41:57;41:59;"Well Kidrock famously hated"
41:59;42:00;"Radiohead so much"
42:00;42:01;"That he made a video"
42:01;42:03;"Where he used Radiohead toilet paper"
42:03;42:05;"So"
42:05;42:07;"It's possible"
42:07;42:08;"He might similarly be like"
42:08;42:10;"What is this s*** man"
42:10;42:12;"You can't do a f***ing 4-track cassette"
42:12;42:14;"It sounds like s***"
42:14;42:15;"The lyrics don't make sense"
42:15;42:17;"The songs are too short"
42:17;42:18;"Too much material"
42:18;42:20;"I'm not into it man"
42:20;42:21;"Didn't someone say that"
42:21;42:22;"Kidrock was back on"
42:22;42:24;"Drinking Bud Light anyway"
42:24;42:25;"Oh I don't know"
42:25;42:26;"I haven't heard that"
42:26;42:27;"I think I saw"
42:27;42:28;"Some photo of him"
42:28;42:29;"Crashing a Bud Light"
42:29;42:31;"That's so funny"
42:31;42:32;"I don't think he's even voting"
42:32;42:33;"Yeah I mean"
42:33;42:34;"So Kidrock's like"
42:34;42:35;"You know what man"
42:35;42:37;"I love what Bud Light's doing"
42:37;42:39;"Reaching out"
42:39;42:41;"To a diverse community of people"
42:41;42:42;"I actually thought about it"
42:42;42:43;"More I'm into that"
42:43;42:44;"I'm gonna get"
42:44;42:46;"A huge Miller Lite"
42:46;42:47;"Boycott"
42:47;42:48;"For people who don't like"
42:48;42:49;"Lo-fi"
42:49;42:50;"Guitar music"
42:50;42:51;"I had a few drinks"
42:51;42:52;"But I didn't go"
42:52;42:53;"I didn't go ham"
42:53;42:55;"I was also kind of by myself"
42:55;42:58;"Do you know what I mean"
42:58;42:59;"Like I hung out with Haydn"
42:59;43:00;"But then he and his buddies"
43:00;43:01;"Were like up"
43:01;43:02;"They had like seats"
43:02;43:03;"And then they were"
43:03;43:04;"Being kind of like hard-asses"
43:04;43:05;"Night 2 about like"
43:05;43:07;"Who could go in and out of the"
43:07;43:08;"The general admission area"
43:08;43:09;"So then I was just kind of like"
43:09;43:10;"Kicking it solo"
43:10;43:11;"Like what am I gonna do"
43:11;43:13;"Just get blackout drunk by myself"
43:13;43:15;"No need"
43:15;43:16;"And also"
43:16;43:18;"Bob's cut way back in the drinking"
43:18;43:20;"So he's mid-60"
43:20;43:21;"He's 65"
43:21;43:23;"I think he'll turn 66 soon"
43:23;43:24;"He had"
43:24;43:25;"There were a couple like"
43:25;43:26;"Ceremonial swigs"
43:26;43:27;"From the tequila bottle"
43:27;43:29;"From the Jose Cuervo"
43:29;43:31;"And maybe like a Miller Lite or two"
43:31;43:32;"Was down"
43:32;43:34;"But it was not"
43:34;43:35;"Like it used to be"
43:35;43:36;"And you know what"
43:36;43:38;"That's better for everyone"
43:38;43:39;"Right"
43:39;43:42;"It was a fun weird solo dad trip"
43:42;43:43;"Love it"
43:43;43:44;"And you got some good pictures"
43:44;43:45;"I got some good pics"
43:45;43:48;"I loved the Ohio farmland"
43:48;43:50;"The Dollar General"
43:50;43:52;"Next to the graveyard"
43:52;43:54;"You just find good stuff"
43:54;43:57;"An old weird burned out Taco Bell sign"
43:57;43:58;"It's just funny"
43:58;43:59;"Like given my interest"
43:59;44:00;"In my subject matter"
44:00;44:01;"For my paintings"
44:01;44:02;"You just drive around"
44:02;44:04;"And you just see it"
44:04;44:05;"Right wherever you are"
44:05;44:06;"You just"
44:06;44:07;"You just gonna find a weird old"
44:07;44:08;"Taco Bell"
44:08;44:10;"You're gonna find Walmarts"
44:10;44:12;"I didn't really have to like search"
44:12;44:14;"I just would kind of drive around"
44:14;44:15;"I'd be like"
44:15;44:16;"I'd like look on a tent"
44:16;44:17;"Like oh there's a town"
44:17;44:18;"That's 30 miles west of Dayton"
44:18;44:19;"That looks interesting"
44:19;44:20;"For no particular"
44:20;44:21;"You know just looking at the map"
44:21;44:22;"I'll drive out there"
44:22;44:23;"And then"
44:23;44:24;"Sure enough"
44:24;44:25;"There's all the stuff"
44:25;44:26;"I'm looking for and more"
44:26;44:27;"So it was anyway"
44:27;44:29;"It was a very fun trip"
44:29;44:31;"But I was excited to come home too"
44:31;44:34;"I'm reading this old"
44:34;44:35;"Interview with Kid Rock"
44:35;44:36;"About Radiohead"
44:36;44:38;"For Q Magazine"
44:38;44:40;"Kid Rock says he doesn't understand"
44:40;44:41;"The appeal of Radiohead"
44:41;44:42;"He says their music"
44:42;44:43;"Does nothing for him"
44:43;44:45;"But he thinks a joint tour"
44:45;44:46;"With the British band"
44:46;44:47;"Could be fun"
44:47;44:48;"Kid Rock told Q Magazine"
44:48;44:49;"""I don't hate them"
44:49;44:50;"I just don't understand them"
44:50;44:51;"I'm listening to their music"
44:51;44:53;"And it does nothing for me"
44:53;44:54;"If I have a party on tour"
44:54;44:56;"I'm not gonna go grab"
44:56;44:57;"The Radiohead CD"
44:57;44:59;"To get the party started"""
44:59;45:00;"Fair enough"
45:00;45:01;"Totally"
45:01;45:02;"The star joked that"
45:02;45:04;"It might be fun to tour together"
45:04;45:06;"""They can go out and be sad"
45:06;45:07;"I'll pick them up"""
45:07;45:08;"Wow"
45:08;45:09;"I think this might be the best era"
45:09;45:10;"Of Kid Rock"
45:10;45:11;"I mean, I like this guy"
45:11;45:12;"Yeah, I think we could have been"
45:12;45:13;"He's gonna bring his"
45:13;45:15;"""Don't be sad boys"""
45:15;45:16;"What was the thing you were saying"
45:16;45:17;"Last episode?"
45:17;45:18;"Oh yeah, we were saying"
45:18;45:19;"With this new wave"
45:19;45:21;"Of all these country guys"
45:21;45:23;"And they're veering a little more sad"
45:23;45:24;"We gotta get"
45:24;45:25;"The kind of country guy out there"
45:25;45:26;"Who's just like"
45:26;45:27;"""Cheer up boys"""
45:27;45:29;"I'm sure that guy exists"
45:29;45:31;"Is that Morgan Wallen?"
45:31;45:32;"Yeah, Morgan Wallen"
45:32;45:34;"Morgan Wallen even with his"
45:35;45:35;"Sort of"
45:35;45:36;"He does a lot of"
45:36;45:37;"Breakup stuff"
45:37;45:38;"But they're usually all puns"
45:38;45:40;"Of some kind of like"
45:40;45:41;"Alcohol thing"
45:41;45:42;"You know, like"
45:42;45:44;"He's really into alcohol puns"
45:44;45:45;"Especially when it comes to breaking up"
45:45;45:46;"But yeah, he's a"
45:46;45:47;"Definitely like a good boy"
45:47;45:49;"Like ""Cheer up boys"""
45:49;45:51;"""Hey, I know you had a bad breakup"
45:51;45:52;"Cheer up boys"""
45:52;45:53;"Radiohead Kid Rock"
45:53;45:55;"Would have been a legendary tour"
45:55;45:57;"But those are the things"
45:57;45:58;"That I think generally"
45:58;46:00;"Don't tend to work"
46:00;46:01;"Like, it seemingly"
46:01;46:03;"Like ""I'm with you kid"""
46:04;46:05;"That's a great narrative arc"
46:05;46:07;"Radiohead comes out"
46:07;46:08;"It's kind of like"
46:08;46:10;"Their music is kind of tense"
46:10;46:12;"There's an element of"
46:12;46:14;"You know, dystopianism"
46:14;46:15;"Feelings of paranoia"
46:15;46:16;"Cerebral"
46:17;46:19;"You're kind of in your head"
46:19;46:21;"You're feeling stressed out"
46:21;46:22;"But then"
46:22;46:23;"As they"
46:23;46:25;"Shuffle off stage"
46:25;46:26;"Then just this"
46:26;46:27;"Suddenly"
46:27;46:29;"You kind of feel your body relax"
46:29;46:31;"And just a warm feeling"
46:31;46:33;"Rises as Kid Rock takes the stage"
46:33;46:35;"And just kind of feel good"
46:35;46:37;"Rock and roll"
46:37;46:39;"And now you're kind of moving"
46:39;46:40;"Like seemingly"
46:40;46:41;"That would be an excellent"
46:41;46:42;"One-two punch"
46:42;46:43;"But I don't know"
46:43;46:45;"Maybe promoters are scared of it"
46:45;46:47;"Or maybe Radiohead said no"
46:47;46:49;"Too libidinal"
46:49;46:50;"Yeah"
46:50;46:51;"The Kid Rock comes out"
46:51;46:53;"There's the full libidinal release"
46:53;46:54;"After the"
46:54;46:57;"The tension and buildup of Radiohead"
46:57;46:59;"Honestly, we should still"
46:59;47:00;"Try to make this happen"
47:00;47:03;"Turns out Tom York's a big fan"
47:03;47:05;"[Laughter]"
47:05;47:06;"[Sigh]"
47:06;47:08;"Oh my God"
47:08;47:13;"Could you stop the noise"
47:13;47:18;"And try to get some way"
47:18;47:28;"From all the"
47:28;47:31;"And unchecked"
47:31;47:36;"Devices in my head"
47:36;47:48;"What's there"
47:48;47:56;"What's there"
47:56;47:57;"I did hear Oliver Anthony"
47:57;47:59;"Being blasted out of a car"
47:59;48:01;"In a Walmart parking lot in Ohio"
48:01;48:02;"And I did feel like"
48:02;48:03;"A New York Times reporter"
48:03;48:05;"You know, out there"
48:05;48:06;"In the Bellwether State"
48:06;48:07;"During election season"
48:07;48:09;"Yeah, Oliver Anthony's hit"
48:09;48:11;"Was it specifically Richmond"
48:11;48:12;"North of Richmond?"
48:12;48:13;"Oh yeah"
48:13;48:14;"No, I really"
48:14;48:15;"It was like Coastal Elite"
48:15;48:16;"In a parking lot"
48:16;48:17;"In rural Ohio"
48:17;48:18;"And yeah"
48:18;48:19;"It was"
48:19;48:20;"Richmond"
48:20;48:21;"North of Richmond"
48:21;48:22;"Getting just"
48:22;48:24;"Blasted out of like a Toyota Celica"
48:24;48:25;"Wow"
48:25;48:27;"He's just absolutely massive"
48:27;48:28;"[Laughter]"
48:28;48:30;"I told you I read that thing"
48:30;48:32;"Some article that said"
48:32;48:34;"He makes $40,000 a day"
48:34;48:35;"In the last"
48:35;48:36;"Oliver Anthony music"
48:36;48:37;"Based on"
48:37;48:39;"Richmond North of Richmond streams"
48:39;48:41;"$40,000 a day"
48:41;48:43;"His next album comes out"
48:43;48:45;"Just moved North of Richmond"
48:45;48:47;"And it's like a picture of him"
48:47;48:48;"Smoking a cigar"
48:48;48:49;"[Laughter]"
48:49;48:50;"In his"
48:50;48:51;"Big rocking chair"
48:51;48:52;"Where would he be living?"
48:52;48:53;"He got a big old house"
48:53;48:55;"In Alexandria, Virginia"
48:55;48:56;"Oh, he's living in the Beltway?"
48:56;48:57;"He's just moving"
48:57;48:58;"He's now a part of"
48:58;48:59;"I'm just trying to think"
48:59;49:00;"When he says North of Richmond"
49:00;49:02;"Because Richmond is the South"
49:02;49:03;"I think that's what he's basically"
49:03;49:04;"Richmond North of Richmond"
49:04;49:05;"I assume"
49:05;49:06;"Yeah, we never even discussed that"
49:06;49:07;"That just means the North"
49:07;49:10;"Or that means specifically DC"
49:10;49:11;"I mean it must mean DC"
49:11;49:13;"I think it means DC"
49:13;49:14;"The way I interpreted it"
49:14;49:16;"It means DC"
49:16;49:17;"Yeah"
49:17;49:18;"But obviously it could"
49:18;49:21;"DC is like pretty North from Richmond"
49:21;49:22;"I mean it's like"
49:22;49:24;"It's been a year since I drove"
49:24;49:25;"I think it's a two hour drive"
49:25;49:26;"Let me see"
49:26;49:27;"I don't interpret it as like"
49:27;49:29;"A North versus South thing"
49:29;49:31;"He just meant DC"
49:31;49:33;"It's the powerful"
49:33;49:35;"Versus the powerless"
49:35;49:37;"Nick, where did like the"
49:37;49:39;"Rich DC insiders"
49:39;49:40;"Live?"
49:40;49:42;"Where'd you get a big old house?"
49:42;49:44;"In like Bethesda, Maryland?"
49:44;49:45;"Chevy Chase?"
49:45;49:47;"Yeah, Chevy Chase, Bethesda"
49:47;49:49;"Georgetown in Washington, DC"
49:49;49:51;"I think you would absolutely"
49:51;49:53;"I mean, Bethesda, Chevy Chase"
49:53;49:55;"Yeah, no, Georgetown's a beautiful place"
49:55;49:56;"It's a beautiful neighborhood"
49:56;49:57;"But it's these old townhouses"
49:57;49:59;"I'm just thinking for the album cover"
49:59;50:00;"Oh, you're saying"
50:00;50:01;"Oh, for the album cover"
50:01;50:02;"By the way, it is"
50:02;50:04;"It's a two hour drive"
50:04;50:05;"So that's exactly what he means"
50:05;50:07;"I just think for his next album"
50:07;50:08;"Where he's like"
50:08;50:09;"Which is basically his"
50:09;50:11;"Finally Rich album"
50:11;50:13;"And every song is about like"
50:13;50:15;"Just bought a house North of Richmond"
50:15;50:17;"Maybe it should be coded"
50:17;50:20;"Like kind of Maryland vibes"
50:20;50:22;"He's got a big house on the water"
50:22;50:24;"You know, like in like"
50:24;50:25;"Wedding crashers"
50:25;50:27;"Like in the Chesapeake style"
50:27;50:28;"You know, like out"
50:28;50:29;"Yeah"
50:29;50:31;"Yeah, he's sitting on his boat"
50:31;50:34;"With a big old beautiful"
50:34;50:37;"Like 19th century house"
50:37;50:38;"On the water"
50:38;50:40;"And the song is like"
50:40;50:42;"Yeah, I just moved North of Richmond"
50:42;50:43;"And he's just bragging about"
50:43;50:44;"How much money he made"
50:44;50:46;"$40,000 a day"
50:46;50:48;"Just moved to Chesapeake Bay"
50:48;50:50;"It's just featuring Little Baby"
50:53;50:54;"Maybe actually his crazy arc"
50:54;50:56;"Is that he's the cheer up boys guy"
50:56;50:59;"After his stirring songs"
50:59;51:00;"About, you know"
51:00;51:02;"The broken American dream"
51:02;51:04;"And you know, living in poverty"
51:04;51:06;"And working like terrible jobs"
51:06;51:08;"And then actually"
51:08;51:10;"Ironically, he proved the American dream"
51:10;51:12;"That America is such a"
51:12;51:13;"Wealthy country"
51:13;51:14;"If you believe in yourself"
51:14;51:15;"You start posting videos"
51:15;51:16;"That you sing on the"
51:16;51:18;"Side of a country highway"
51:18;51:19;"You could be raking in"
51:19;51:20;"$40,000 a day"
51:20;51:22;"You could move to Chesapeake Bay"
51:22;51:23;"So maybe the next album is like"
51:23;51:26;"Really kind of happy"
51:26;51:28;"My life started to spiral"
51:28;51:30;"The day I went viral"
51:30;51:31;"Yeah, maybe every since"
51:31;51:33;"Like my life was spiraling"
51:33;51:35;"After I went viraling"
51:35;51:36;"Everybody in Farmville"
51:36;51:37;"Didn't have any chill"
51:37;51:38;"Actually, it's the small town"
51:38;51:40;"People started getting weird"
51:40;51:42;"And then he moves to"
51:42;51:43;"Greater DC"
51:43;51:45;"He's hanging out"
51:45;51:47;"Thomas Friedman"
51:47;51:50;"The Tom Friedman column"
51:51;51:52;"In the New York Times"
51:52;51:54;"My lunch with Oliver Anthony"
51:54;51:56;"Oliver Anthony buys"
51:56;51:58;"Jeffrey Epstein's Island"
51:58;52:00;"Oh my God"
52:00;52:01;"Yeah, they're like"
52:01;52:02;"You know, always"
52:02;52:03;"Remember with MIA"
52:03;52:04;"I think it was with MIA"
52:04;52:05;"And that big thing was like"
52:05;52:06;"What she ordered for lunch"
52:06;52:07;"Do you remember"
52:07;52:08;"When the New York Times"
52:08;52:09;"They were trying to take her down"
52:09;52:11;"Because she ordered truffle fries"
52:11;52:13;"Yeah, Oliver Anthony"
52:13;52:15;"Orders some kind of"
52:15;52:18;"He ordered the $65"
52:18;52:20;"Lobster roll"
52:20;52:22;"He's having lunch with"
52:22;52:24;"JD Vance"
52:24;52:29;"Eating artisanal fudge rounds"
52:29;52:31;"Now, you're not going to believe this"
52:31;52:32;"But Oliver Anthony"
52:32;52:34;"Had his personal chef"
52:34;52:36;"Prepare the world's first"
52:36;52:39;"$10,000 fudge round"
52:39;52:41;"He's making like a TikTok"
52:41;52:43;"Some restaurant"
52:43;52:45;"That makes these"
52:45;52:47;"Artisanal"
52:47;52:49;"You know, like deconstructed fudge round"
52:49;52:52;"With powdered gold on them"
52:52;52:55;"Looks like we made it"
52:55;52:57;"Sad news"
52:57;52:59;"A couple weeks ago"
52:59;53:01;"The iconic Jimmy Buffett"
53:01;53:04;"Passed away on September 1st"
53:04;53:05;"I can't remember how much"
53:05;53:07;"We've talked Buffett on this show"
53:07;53:08;"Not a whole lot"
53:08;53:09;"Maybe not a whole lot"
53:09;53:10;"And actually"
53:10;53:12;"I feel like you're a fan, Jake"
53:12;53:14;"But I guess as we start"
53:14;53:15;"I'm not totally sure"
53:15;53:17;"What's your relationship to Buffett?"
53:17;53:18;"I'm not not a fan"
53:18;53:20;"I just I haven't heard enough"
53:20;53:22;"Where I mean I love the song"
53:22;53:23;"Margaritaville"
53:23;53:24;"Great song"
53:24;53:25;"What I've heard is other songs"
53:25;53:27;"They haven't really grabbed me"
53:27;53:29;"In a way that made me want to"
53:29;53:30;"Like really go deep"
53:30;53:32;"There's so many ways we could tackle"
53:32;53:34;"You know his legacy and his life"
53:34;53:37;"But maybe because this is time crisis"
53:37;53:39;"We got to just throw in Margaritaville"
53:39;53:40;"And kind of like do a deep dive"
53:40;53:41;"On that song"
53:41;53:42;"I would love to"
53:42;53:43;"Let's just start there"
53:43;53:45;"Yeah, I mean I listened to a few others"
53:45;53:47;"I listened to his 1985"
53:47;53:48;"Greatest Hits comp"
53:48;53:49;"And I was"
53:49;53:50;"I was feeling it"
53:50;53:52;"That's his best-selling album"
53:52;53:53;"That Greatest Hits comp"
53:53;53:55;"It's from 1977"
53:55;53:57;"This is from '77, right?"
53:57;53:58;"Yeah, this is"
53:58;54:00;"Watching the sun bake"
54:00;54:03;"All of those tourists"
54:03;54:05;"Covered with oil"
54:05;54:11;"Strumming my six-string"
54:11;54:15;"On my front porch swing"
54:16;54:18;"Smell those shrimp"
54:18;54:20;"They're beginning to boil"
54:20;54:26;"Wasting away again"
54:26;54:28;"In Margaritaville"
54:28;54:34;"Searching for my lost"
54:34;54:36;"Sugar or salt"
54:36;54:41;"Some people claim"
54:41;54:43;"That there's a woman"
54:43;54:45;"To blame"
54:46;54:48;"But I know"
54:48;54:51;"Nobody's fault"
54:51;54:52;"Okay, pause it for a second"
54:52;54:54;"It's not a million miles"
54:54;54:56;"From the Eagles, really"
54:56;54:58;"Right, yeah, the Eagles"
54:58;54:59;"That's a good reference"
54:59;55:00;"Kind of like"
55:00;55:02;"Semi-country"
55:02;55:04;"Not too country"
55:04;55:06;"A kind of"
55:06;55:08;"Sweet sadness"
55:08;55:09;"Right, observational"
55:09;55:11;"I mean, apparently he had written that song"
55:11;55:13;"Initially as like"
55:13;55:15;"I gotta assume he was influenced by the Eagles"
55:15;55:17;"Because he had written it apparently as sort of"
55:17;55:19;"Yeah, like a kind of"
55:19;55:21;"A wry, critical"
55:21;55:23;"Outlook on the"
55:23;55:25;"Tourists that come into Key West"
55:25;55:27;"Right, and so in terms of his life"
55:27;55:29;"At this point he was just kind of"
55:29;55:30;"He found"
55:30;55:32;"He's from Louisiana"
55:32;55:34;"He'd probably been all over the place"
55:34;55:36;"And he ended up in Key West"
55:36;55:39;"Yeah, and he's like 30 at this point"
55:39;55:42;"Born December 25th, '46"
55:42;55:44;"So yeah, in '77 he's like 30"
55:44;55:47;"And he'd released a bunch of records already"
55:47;55:49;"Yeah, so he was doing alright"
55:49;55:50;"This was his first hit"
55:50;55:51;"But he'd been, you know"
55:51;55:52;"He had a career"
55:52;55:54;"He was doing alright"
55:54;55:56;"He's down in Key West"
55:56;55:57;"Just hanging out"
55:57;55:59;"I mean, as many people have commented"
55:59;56:01;"What's interesting about this song"
56:01;56:03;"Being his signature song"
56:03;56:05;"His biggest hit"
56:05;56:07;"And in some ways one of the most successful songs of all time"
56:07;56:09;"If you consider that it became a restaurant"
56:09;56:11;"Kind of created a lifestyle"
56:11;56:12;"Yeah"
56:12;56:14;"In a way that a lot of songs"
56:14;56:16;"Even great songs"
56:16;56:17;"Haven't"
56:17;56:19;"As many people have pointed out"
56:19;56:20;"What's unusual about it"
56:20;56:22;"Is that at its heart"
56:22;56:24;"It's kind of a sad song"
56:24;56:26;"You know, all the details sound great"
56:26;56:28;"Nibbling on sponge cake"
56:28;56:29;"Watching the sun bake"
56:29;56:31;"All those tourists covered in oil"
56:31;56:32;"He's just hanging out playing guitar"
56:32;56:34;"On his front porch swing"
56:34;56:35;"The shrimp are beginning to boil"
56:35;56:37;"It's all good"
56:37;56:38;"But then wasting away again"
56:38;56:40;"In Margaritaville"
56:40;56:42;"I mean, just obviously wasting away"
56:42;56:43;"Yeah, that's great"
56:43;56:45;"Is that what you're trying to describe"
56:45;56:47;"Hanging out by the beach"
56:47;56:49;"Yeah, the song takes a turn there for sure"
56:49;56:52;"Searching for my lost shaker of salt"
56:52;56:53;"Yeah, and then some people claim"
56:53;56:55;"That there's a woman to blame"
56:55;56:56;"But I know it's nobody's fault"
56:56;56:58;"But then you're kind of like"
56:58;57:00;"It's actually very mysterious initially"
57:00;57:02;"A woman to blame for what"
57:02;57:04;"Is it about alcoholism"
57:04;57:06;"Is he drinking too much"
57:06;57:07;"I think he is"
57:07;57:08;"He's wasting away"
57:08;57:09;"You know, it's interesting"
57:09;57:11;"Another song from 1977"
57:11;57:13;"A Jake favorite"
57:13;57:14;"I'm sorry, Ezra"
57:14;57:15;"Is this a born"
57:15;57:16;"Because I thought about it"
57:16;57:18;"Is this a born in the USA"
57:18;57:19;"Kind of situation"
57:19;57:21;"Where the majority of the audience"
57:21;57:25;"May just not really understand"
57:25;57:27;"There's an irony in what's being said"
57:27;57:28;"Do you know what I mean"
57:28;57:29;"You got all these people now"
57:29;57:31;"Going to drink at a Margaritaville"
57:31;57:33;"At the Cancun airport"
57:33;57:35;"And get wasted on understanding"
57:35;57:37;"Well, but Jimmy Bucket"
57:37;57:38;"Oathing those Margaritavilles"
57:38;57:39;"I guess"
57:39;57:40;"No, I understand"
57:40;57:41;"The man sees an opportunity"
57:42;57:43;"I'm just, I get it"
57:43;57:44;"That's what I was saying"
57:44;57:45;"Initially"
57:45;57:46;"I was reading about it a little bit"
57:46;57:48;"It was like originally"
57:48;57:49;"It's like intended"
57:49;57:51;"As sort of like a wry criticism"
57:51;57:53;"Of like hedonistic"
57:53;57:55;"Tourist lifestyle"
57:55;57:57;"Just like going somewhere"
57:57;57:58;"And just getting hammered"
57:58;58:00;"And just, you know"
58:00;58:01;"Baking in the sun"
58:01;58:03;"And then I think that"
58:03;58:04;"It seemed like the song"
58:04;58:05;"Kind of took on a life of its own"
58:05;58:07;"Or like the meaning of"
58:07;58:08;"You can't control the meaning"
58:08;58:09;"Of your work, essentially"
58:09;58:11;"And maybe Jimmy just went with the flow"
58:11;58:12;"Of how people interpreted it"
58:12;58:13;"And you know, maybe"
58:13;58:15;"I mean, this is, I'm just speculating"
58:15;58:16;"Maybe in my head"
58:16;58:18;"He was writing kind of an"
58:18;58:21;"Like a cynical eagle song"
58:21;58:24;"But Jimmy's heart and his vibe"
58:24;58:28;"Are too buoyant and generous"
58:28;58:30;"To really kind of do"
58:30;58:31;"The sort of cynical lion eyes"
58:31;58:32;"Kind of thing"
58:32;58:33;"Well, you know what's interesting"
58:33;58:35;"A song that came out"
58:35;58:38;"Almost at the exact same time as this"
58:38;58:41;"Is Hotel California"
58:41;58:44;"The album came out a month before this"
58:44;58:45;"Essentially Hotel California"
58:45;58:46;"And Margaritaville"
58:46;58:48;"Were singles at the same time"
58:48;58:49;"Amazing"
58:49;58:50;"On American radio"
58:50;58:55;"And they both describe a place"
58:55;58:57;"One is Hotel California"
58:57;58:59;"One is Margaritaville"
58:59;59:02;"And arguably they both are"
59:02;59:04;"They're two songs about"
59:04;59:06;"You know, gilded cages"
59:06;59:08;"Obviously California represents"
59:08;59:10;"The American dream"
59:10;59:12;"The first destiny"
59:12;59:13;"Hollywood"
59:13;59:14;"The beautiful people"
59:14;59:15;"But the idea"
59:15;59:16;"Locked here"
59:16;59:18;"Yeah, and Hotel California is creepier"
59:18;59:20;"It's a strange, weirder song"
59:20;59:22;"But it's interesting"
59:22;59:24;"They're both about being"
59:24;59:26;"They're both playing with"
59:26;59:28;"These kind of positive signifiers"
59:28;59:30;"Checking into a hotel in California"
59:30;59:32;"Sounds pretty tight"
59:32;59:34;"Turns out you can never leave"
59:34;59:35;"Mirrors on the ceiling"
59:35;59:37;"Pink champagne on ice"
59:37;59:39;"Sounds like a party"
59:39;59:40;"We're prisoners here"
59:40;59:42;"Of our own device"
59:42;59:43;"And yeah, Margaritaville"
59:43;59:45;"Sounds like a pretty tight place"
59:45;59:46;"Well anyway, let's keep listening"
59:46;59:48;"Let's hear verse two"
59:48;59:52;"Don't know the reason"
59:52;59:54;"Stayed here all season"
59:54;59:55;"Okay, he doesn't know the reason"
59:55;59:56;"He stayed here all season"
59:56;59:58;"Nothing to show"
59:58;01:00:01;"But this brand new tattoo"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"Probably a terrible tattoo"
01:00:03;01:00:04;"Yeah, you got down there"
01:00:04;01:00:07;"But it's a real beauty"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"Buffett claims that he wrote the song"
01:00:09;01:00:11;"In the last six minutes"
01:00:11;01:00:13;"Attempting to negatively portray"
01:00:13;01:00:14;"Tourists in Key West"
01:00:14;01:00:15;"Right, that's what I'm saying"
01:00:15;01:00:16;"But it actually led"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"To an increase in tourists"
01:00:18;01:00:19;"His tattoo is of a Mexican cutie"
01:00:19;01:00:20;"Yeah"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"Wasting away again"
01:00:22;01:00:27;"In Margaritaville"
01:00:27;01:00:30;"Searching for my lost"
01:00:30;01:00:31;"So he was"
01:00:31;01:00:32;"He was hammered"
01:00:32;01:00:33;"And he got a tattoo"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"Right"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"Some people claim"
01:00:37;01:00:41;"There's a woman to blame"
01:00:41;01:00:42;"Now I think"
01:00:42;01:00:43;"He just picked like"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"A Mexican woman"
01:00:45;01:00:47;"From like the tattoo book"
01:00:47;01:00:48;"He like"
01:00:48;01:00:49;"Ruined his relationship"
01:00:49;01:00:51;"And now he's got this like"
01:00:51;01:00:55;"Non-existent woman tattooed on him"
01:00:55;01:00:56;"Yeah, just like a Betty Boop"
01:00:56;01:00:57;"Kind of thing"
01:00:57;01:00:58;"Wait, did you notice"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"At the end of the last chorus"
01:01:00;01:01:03;"He goes, ""Must be Buffett's fault"""
01:01:03;01:01:05;"Oh"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"So the first one"
01:01:06;01:01:07;"It's nobody's fault"
01:01:07;01:01:08;"Well, he changes it a lot"
01:01:08;01:01:09;"I think, yeah"
01:01:09;01:01:10;"Or he said, ""Now I think"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"It could be my fault"""
01:01:12;01:01:13;"No, by the end he knows"
01:01:13;01:01:14;"Right"
01:01:14;01:01:15;"Yeah, yeah"
01:01:15;01:01:16;"Yeah, he's ramping it up"
01:01:16;01:01:17;"Each chorus"
01:01:17;01:01:18;"Yeah"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"This is a great verse here"
01:01:20;01:01:23;"I blew out my flip-flop"
01:01:23;01:01:24;"Classic"

01:01:28;01:01:30;"Cut my heel"
01:01:30;01:01:33;"Had to cruise on back home"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"Cruise on back home"
01:01:35;01:01:40;"But there's booze in the blender"
01:01:40;01:01:43;"And soon it will render"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"That frozen concoction"

01:03:05;01:03:07;"I was checking out some live Buffett"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"with the Choral Reefer Band."
01:03:09;01:03:13;"He often had live, he would have a guy playing steel drums."
01:03:13;01:03:14;"Oh, that's tight."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"There is a spookiness to this song."
01:03:16;01:03:19;"I mean, it's interesting this question about, Nick, you're talking about"
01:03:19;01:03:21;"is it like a ""Born in the USA"" situation"
01:03:21;01:03:24;"where maybe people are misinterpreting it."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"But I would say it's even like..."
01:03:26;01:03:27;"it's even weirder."
01:03:27;01:03:30;"And I... there's a tweet I saw right when he died"
01:03:30;01:03:33;"that I wanted to share with you guys."
01:03:33;01:03:36;"Somebody named Brandon Wenard."

01:03:43;01:03:44;"Or he follows me."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"Seems like an interesting guy."
01:03:46;01:03:50;"He shared a quote from Jimmy Buffett's memoir, ""Pirate Looks at 50""."

01:03:53;01:03:54;"It's out of print."
01:03:54;01:03:58;"A hardcover copy is going to run you about $900."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"Wow!"
01:03:59;01:04:02;"It's like an out of print, like, art monograph or something."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"Yeah, kind of."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"That's hilarious."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"I'll shell out for Jimmy."
01:04:06;01:04:07;"You can't get that on Kindle?"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"You could probably get it for cheaper."
01:04:09;01:04:12;"And I didn't... it didn't seem like you could..."
01:04:12;01:04:13;"I got to do some more research."
01:04:13;01:04:17;"But the first edition hardcover is expensive."

01:10:18;01:10:20;"Jimmy Buffett got big right when like"
01:10:20;01:10:23;"the dream of the hippies died and people went inward"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"and just wanted to have a good time"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"and were only looking out for themselves."
01:10:27;01:10:29;"There are all the negative things people say about boomers."
01:10:29;01:10:31;"Holding on to all the money,"
01:10:31;01:10:34;"holding on to all the positions in government."
01:10:34;01:10:37;"But obviously, Jimmy Buffett,"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"and I'm sure most of the parrot heads,"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"a lot of the people there having a good time"
01:10:41;01:10:44;"when, you know, Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band"
01:10:44;01:10:47;"came through, maybe on a cold day"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"in a cold part of the country."
01:10:49;01:10:51;"They're having a good time because"
01:10:51;01:10:53;"they are trying to just celebrate life."
01:10:53;01:10:55;"Those people have lots of problems too."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"They're not all people who necessarily like"
01:10:57;01:10:59;"gave up on helping others."
01:10:59;01:11:01;"You know, they might be people who like Jimmy Buffett"
01:11:01;01:11:05;"had to embrace the totality of existence."
01:11:05;01:11:09;"I mean, to go back to this dude's Dao reference,"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"what is the classic symbol of Daoism?"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"It's the yin yang, man."
01:11:13;01:11:15;"Everything is connected, right?"
01:11:15;01:11:17;"You got the black circle and the white half"
01:11:17;01:11:19;"and you got the white circle and the black half."
01:11:19;01:11:21;"Is it really that weird to imagine"
01:11:21;01:11:24;"that somewhere inside Margaritaville"
01:11:24;01:11:28;"is a bit of sadness and also somewhere inside sadness"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"is an ice cold margarita?"
01:11:30;01:11:31;"You know what I mean?"
01:11:31;01:11:33;"Like, it's everything at once."
01:11:33;01:11:36;"It's perfectly balanced in its lyrics"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"because the way he finishes it with"
01:11:38;01:11:39;"""it's my own damn fault."""
01:11:39;01:11:41;"I mean, like you said, there's almost like"
01:11:41;01:11:43;"a mellow catharsis."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"He ends on solid footing instead of just being like..."
01:11:45;01:11:48;"- On responsibility. - Yeah."
01:11:48;01:11:53;"So we don't know a lot about the Margaritaville narrator."
01:11:53;01:11:54;"We could assume it's Jimmy Buffett,"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"but let's just say it's its own guy,"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"the Margaritaville man."
01:11:58;01:12:00;"By the time we get to the end of the song,"
01:12:00;01:12:03;"if you asked me to bet, ""Is this guy gonna be okay?"""
01:12:03;01:12:05;"I'd say, ""Hell yeah, this guy's gonna be okay."""
01:12:05;01:12:08;"- Yeah, exactly. - Yeah, I know we're joking about it before,"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"but like, no, this dude's not about to die."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"It'd be like, this dude went through like"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"a dark month in Key West"
01:12:14;01:12:17;"and actually he's gonna be telling stories about it,"
01:12:17;01:12:20;"cracking people up, bringing tears to their eyes"
01:12:20;01:12:23;"later in life. He's gonna be okay."
01:12:23;01:12:25;"Yeah, that's why it works so well as an anthem."
01:12:25;01:12:27;"'Cause at the end of the day, it is..."
01:12:27;01:12:29;"He's coming out the other side."
01:12:29;01:12:31;"If it just was ""Hopeless,"" it wouldn't work as an anthem"
01:12:31;01:12:35;"and it wouldn't work as the basis for a restaurant chain."
01:12:35;01:12:37;"He threaded the needle perfectly."
01:12:37;01:12:40;"It's why there couldn't be a Hotel California..."
01:12:40;01:12:43;"- Exactly. - ...chain of hotels"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"with breweries attached to them."
01:12:45;01:12:49;"Too heady, too lofty, too poetic, too dark."
01:12:49;01:12:51;"Did you guys know that there was a Jimmy Buffett"
01:12:51;01:12:53;"retirement community?"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"I'd heard about that."
01:12:55;01:12:57;"- They actually built it? - There was actually..."
01:12:57;01:12:59;"Yeah, no, there was a Nick Palmgarten article"
01:12:59;01:13:02;"in the New Yorker I reread."
01:13:02;01:13:04;"It was from like early last year."
01:13:04;01:13:07;"I forget, it's in Florida somewhere. Shocker."
01:13:07;01:13:11;"But yeah, it was basically for like, you know,"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"people of that age,"
01:13:13;01:13:16;"those boomers of that persuasion,"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"who are parent heads."
01:13:18;01:13:20;"I'm assuming you have to be a parent head"
01:13:20;01:13:23;"to have any interest in that."
01:13:23;01:13:25;"That's a pretty wild..."
01:13:25;01:13:28;"In terms of like, you're a musician,"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"you're living in Key West in the '70s,"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"you write a song, it's a hit."
01:13:32;01:13:36;"In 1985, you open your first Margaritaville restaurant"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"in the place that the song was set."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"- That's logical, right? - Right."
01:13:40;01:13:42;"Then it starts to take off."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"It's not like a giant chain, but I think there's like"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"30-something Margaritavilles"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"in cities around the US."
01:13:48;01:13:52;"I think there's like eight or nine Margaritavilles in airports."
01:13:52;01:13:55;"So now your song has gone from"
01:13:55;01:13:58;"the hit in the '70s to like an airport bar."
01:13:58;01:14:01;"- Yeah. - And then you're like one step further."
01:14:01;01:14:03;"He skipped the Disney ride"
01:14:03;01:14:06;"and he went straight to the retirement community."
01:14:06;01:14:08;"It's pretty wild."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"I don't know how heavy the branding is"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"on the retirement community,"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"but I don't know, man."
01:14:14;01:14:17;"Maybe they don't have to play it too hard."
01:14:17;01:14:20;"Because also the Jimmy Buffett iconography,"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"it's bigger than him."
01:14:22;01:14:25;"- It's open. - It's people who like the beach"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"and hanging out."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"So if you want to frame it positively,"
01:14:29;01:14:32;"it's like this song that has a touch of melancholy"
01:14:32;01:14:35;"and a touch of happiness"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"and a touch of heaven"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"and a touch of hell all together."
01:14:39;01:14:42;"It really spoke to people. It did hit something."
01:14:42;01:14:45;"- Salty and sweet. - It's salty? Wow."
01:14:45;01:14:47;"I didn't even think about that."
01:14:47;01:14:49;"The perfect drink."
01:14:49;01:14:53;"Is a margarita the yin-yang of mixed drinks?"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"- Yes. I think so. - Yeah, why truly?"
01:14:55;01:14:58;"- The Dowell Buffett. - It's definitely my favorite mixed drink."
01:14:58;01:15:01;"Also, I forgot, I saved a few things"
01:15:01;01:15:04;"to talk about from a couple weeks ago."
01:15:04;01:15:07;"When he died, I took a look over at the Jimmy Buffett Reddit"
01:15:07;01:15:10;"where, of course, you had people sharing stories"
01:15:10;01:15:13;"and grieving the loss of a guy who really spoke to them."
01:15:13;01:15:16;"And I hadn't even thought about this. It's so obvious."
01:15:16;01:15:20;"But there's a post from Cosmic Surf Farmer"
01:15:20;01:15:23;"who said, titled the post,"
01:15:23;01:15:25;"""A deadhead comes with empathy."""
01:15:25;01:15:28;"""It's been 28 years since Jerry Garcia passed"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"and I still listen to his music every day."
01:15:30;01:15:33;"I am the person I am because of the friends I made"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"and the experiences I had around that music."
01:15:35;01:15:38;"Today is your August 9th, 1995."
01:15:38;01:15:40;"I hope you have wonderful memories"
01:15:40;01:15:43;"and that Jimmy Buffett's music will carry you through life"
01:15:43;01:15:45;"like a warm wind."
01:15:45;01:15:49;"Remember, there's nothing you can hold for very long."""
01:15:49;01:15:51;"And I'm sure people remark on this all the time,"
01:15:51;01:15:53;"it just hadn't really crossed my mind."
01:15:53;01:15:56;"I'm like, ""Oh, yeah, it is. It's so dead."""
01:15:56;01:16:01;"You know, this kind of mellow figure music that..."
01:16:01;01:16:06;"- Yeah, Papa Bear. - Yeah, a kind of central dad figure that..."
01:16:06;01:16:08;"- Guru. - A guru."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"Both of them gurus, you know?"
01:16:10;01:16:13;"Because it's not just like, ""Oh, yeah, I like the music."""
01:16:13;01:16:16;"With both those artists, there's a deeper feeling of"
01:16:16;01:16:21;"the lyrics, the music, the people, the community"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"taught me how to live."
01:16:23;01:16:26;"And of course, there's psycho fans for everything."
01:16:26;01:16:28;"But this idea that..."
01:16:28;01:16:30;"The idea truly of a lifestyle."
01:16:30;01:16:32;"They taught me how to live."
01:16:32;01:16:35;"That's as good as it gets, of course."
01:16:35;01:16:39;"Jerry, Robert Hunter, Jimmy Buffett should be very proud."
01:16:39;01:16:42;"Their music actually does have a philosophy"
01:16:42;01:16:45;"about how to deal with life."
01:16:45;01:16:48;"- That's rarefied air. - Yeah."
01:16:48;01:16:50;"Do you want to listen to Cheeseburger in Paradise?"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"- All right, let's throw on Cheeseburger in Paradise. - Or should we move on?"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"Yeah. Okay, yeah."
01:16:54;01:16:57;"You know, it's such a famous title, and I listened to the song when he died"
01:16:57;01:17:00;"and I realized I had never actually heard the song."
01:17:00;01:17:02;"I don't know how that's possible."
01:17:02;01:17:05;"I know what you mean. I'm so much more familiar with Margaritaville."
01:17:05;01:17:06;"I threw it on, too."
01:17:06;01:17:08;"I love this story."
01:17:08;01:17:11;"Carnivorous habits"
01:17:11;01:17:14;"Made in nearly 70 days"
01:17:14;01:17:18;"Losing weight without speed eating sunflower seeds"
01:17:18;01:17:21;"Drinking lots of carrot juice and soaking up a race"
01:17:21;01:17:25;"But it's not I'd have these wonderful dreams"
01:17:25;01:17:28;"Some kind of sensuous treat"
01:17:28;01:17:31;"Not zucchini, fettuccine, bulgur, wheat"
01:17:31;01:17:35;"But a big warm bun and a huge chunk of meat"
01:17:35;01:17:39;"Cheeseburger in Paradise"
01:17:39;01:17:42;"Grab out all the vegetables and onion slice"
01:17:42;01:17:45;"Not too particular, not too precise"
01:17:45;01:17:48;"I'm just a Cheeseburger in Paradise"
01:17:48;01:17:51;"Wait, pause it for a second. One thing I clogged listening to it."
01:17:51;01:17:56;"So, yeah, he's a guy, he tried to amend his carnivorous ways, made in nearly 70 days."
01:17:56;01:17:59;"He was trying to go eat healthy, whatever."
01:17:59;01:18:03;"But he keeps thinking about, in his dreams, a cheeseburger."
01:18:03;01:18:08;"So far, so good. And then the chorus is, ""Cheeseburger in Paradise, heaven on earth with an onion slice."""
01:18:08;01:18:11;"Not too particular, not too precise."
01:18:11;01:18:15;"But then the final line, ""I'm just a Cheeseburger in Paradise."""
01:18:15;01:18:18;"That one really threw me for a loop. I was like, ""Wait, you're the cheeseburger?"""
01:18:18;01:18:20;"Right. This is like..."
01:18:20;01:18:24;"The cheeseburger in Paradise that symbolically represents you?"
01:18:24;01:18:28;"Because so far it's just about a guy who's kind of craving a burger."
01:18:28;01:18:32;"Right. Drinking carrot juice, eating sunflower seeds."
01:18:32;01:18:36;"But now he is a cheeseburger in Paradise?"
01:18:36;01:18:41;"That threw me for a loop. Let's see if we can get to the bottom of it in the rest of the song."
01:18:44;01:19:05;"Oh, so he's the sailor."
01:19:07;01:19:22;"So he's saying times have changed for a sailor. Is he a sailor who's out of America?"
01:19:22;01:19:25;"I think he's a hobbyist gentleman sailor."
01:19:25;01:19:29;"But he just rolled up to Antigua."
01:19:29;01:19:33;"And now times have changed and he can get a cheeseburger wherever he goes?"
01:19:33;01:19:36;"He lives in the time and in the place of plenty."
01:19:36;01:19:37;"Yeah."
01:19:39;01:19:50;"Draft."
01:19:52;01:20:02;"Making the best of every virtue and vice."
01:20:02;01:20:03;"Yep."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"That's that yin yang."
01:20:05;01:20:06;"Yep."
01:20:08;01:20:11;"To be a cheeseburger in Paradise."
01:20:13;01:20:18;"This part sounds great."
01:20:18;01:20:22;"Yeah, he keeps saying to be a cheeseburger. He could have said to eat a cheeseburger in Paradise."
01:20:22;01:20:23;"Right."
01:20:25;01:20:30;"French fries, potatoes, big kosher pickle and a cold draft beer."
01:20:30;01:20:34;"Well, good God, almighty, which way do I steer?"
01:20:34;01:20:37;"Funny ending, by the way."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"I mean, it kind of just trails off."
01:20:39;01:20:42;"I mean, that's so funny."
01:20:42;01:20:44;"I'm a cheeseburger."
01:20:44;01:20:46;"Yes."
01:20:46;01:20:48;"Singing at the top of your lungs."
01:20:48;01:20:50;"I'm a cheeseburger."
01:20:50;01:20:53;"I'm just a cheeseburger in..."
01:20:53;01:20:57;"So he said the song was inspired by a long trip on his first boat."
01:20:57;01:21:03;"We'd run into some very rough weather, crossing between Hispaniola and Puerto Rico."
01:21:03;01:21:05;"The ice in our box had melted."
01:21:05;01:21:07;"We were doing the canned food and peanut butter diet."
01:21:07;01:21:10;"The vision of a piping hot cheeseburger kept popping into my mind."
01:21:10;01:21:15;"We limped up the Sir Francis Drake Channel and into Road Town on the island of Tortola,"
01:21:15;01:21:19;"where a brand new marina and bar sat on the end of the dock like a mirage."
01:21:19;01:21:21;"We secured the boat, kissed the ground,"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"and headed for the restaurant to our amazement."
01:21:23;01:21:28;"We were offered a menu that featured an American cheeseburger and pina coladas."
01:21:28;01:21:30;"All right. I have a theory."
01:21:30;01:21:31;"Best burger of his life."
01:21:31;01:21:33;"All right. Totally."
01:21:33;01:21:37;"Is that the song, outside of the story you just told,"
01:21:37;01:21:40;"is about a guy who wants a cheeseburger,"
01:21:40;01:21:45;"but the current sort of food fashion is like health food, right?"
01:21:45;01:21:47;"Weight loss, health food, sunflower seeds."
01:21:47;01:21:50;"And he's been out of port for a while, so he wants a cheeseburger."
01:21:50;01:21:53;"He wants this thing that's sort of out of fashion, good old American cheeseburger."
01:21:53;01:21:56;"He is also a cheeseburger."
01:21:56;01:21:57;"Oh, I see."
01:21:57;01:21:58;"He's out of fashion."
01:21:58;01:22:00;"He's out of step with the times."
01:22:00;01:22:01;"Nice."
01:22:01;01:22:03;"You know, I've heard a few songs like this. Do you know what I mean?"
01:22:03;01:22:07;"What was one of the songs or two, the brothers, they have that song, the hippie, the..."
01:22:07;01:22:09;"Yeah, Old Hippie."
01:22:09;01:22:10;"Yeah, Old Hippie."
01:22:10;01:22:13;"Like a song a little bit, you know, he's..."
01:22:13;01:22:15;"So he wants that cheeseburger."
01:22:15;01:22:16;"He's a simple guy."
01:22:16;01:22:17;"He is that cheeseburger."
01:22:17;01:22:20;"He's not too particular, not too precise."
01:22:20;01:22:22;"And he's out of, he's sort of out of step with the times."
01:22:22;01:22:24;"That's a great read, Nick."
01:22:24;01:22:25;"Yeah, that's a great interpretation."
01:22:25;01:22:27;"Here's a slightly weirder one."
01:22:27;01:22:31;"He opens the song, ""I was trying to amend my carnivorous ways."
01:22:31;01:22:33;"Made it nearly 70 days."""
01:22:33;01:22:38;"Maybe some part of him really wrestled with the moral implications of eating meat."
01:22:38;01:22:41;"And he was like, hemming and hawing out how I want to be a good person,"
01:22:41;01:22:44;"but I'm bringing suffering to these cows."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"Oh my God, maybe I got it."
01:22:47;01:22:49;"The only way to live correctly is if you eat sunflower seeds"
01:22:49;01:22:52;"or drinking lots of carrot juice and all this stuff."
01:22:52;01:22:58;"But these messages are being sent to him by the universe saying,"
01:22:58;01:23:01;"""No, man, you are carnivorous."
01:23:01;01:23:03;"Like that's what you were put on this earth to do,"
01:23:03;01:23:04;"is to eat a cheeseburger in paradise."""
01:23:04;01:23:07;"And then he has this weird sense of oneness and he goes,"
01:23:07;01:23:13;"""I was so worried about eating meat,"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"but then I realized I am meat."
01:23:16;01:23:18;"I'm part of like the great circle of life."
01:23:18;01:23:21;"You know, my ancestors were eaten by lions and bears."
01:23:21;01:23:23;"I honor this cheeseburger."
01:23:23;01:23:26;"I do respect the sacrifice this cow made."
01:23:26;01:23:28;"I would actually call it heaven on earth."
01:23:28;01:23:31;"I praise this amazing American creation"
01:23:31;01:23:34;"and I see myself as another piece of meat"
01:23:34;01:23:38;"in part of this beautiful dance that we call life."
01:23:38;01:23:40;"I ate the cheeseburger in paradise."
01:23:40;01:23:42;"I am the cheeseburger in paradise."""
01:23:42;01:23:43;"You know what I mean?"
01:23:44;01:23:47;"He kind of got past that kind of, I don't know,"
01:23:47;01:23:50;"like vegetarian moralism and he got to this kind of like"
01:23:50;01:23:52;"higher level of how he sees himself,"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"which is classic Buffett."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"Yeah, I love that."
01:23:56;01:23:59;"Guys, in 2002, Buffett's company,"
01:23:59;01:24:02;"Margaritaville Holdings LLC,"
01:24:02;01:24:05;"licensed the name of the song to OSI Restaurant Partners"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"as the name of the Buffett-themed"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"cheeseburger in paradise restaurant chain."
01:24:10;01:24:14;"His two biggest songs both became restaurant chains."
01:24:14;01:24:17;"Well, this one feels like maybe he's sort of..."
01:24:17;01:24:19;"He's chasing the dragon."
01:24:19;01:24:22;"He's definitely chasing the dragon."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"I think he was just like, oh, this..."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"I mean, you can even tell Margaritaville"
01:24:26;01:24:28;"the cheeseburger in paradise."
01:24:28;01:24:30;"There's certainly like, he's just like, ooh,"
01:24:30;01:24:32;"I think I could do that again."
01:24:32;01:24:34;"In 2006, the restaurant had 38 locations"
01:24:34;01:24:36;"in 17 states in the United States"
01:24:36;01:24:38;"and one in Sydney, Australia."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"And in Secaucus, New Jersey."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"Oh, it's close to where I grew up."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"See, the problem with that restaurant name"
01:24:45;01:24:48;"is that it's inevitably not going to be in paradise."
01:24:48;01:24:51;"You're going to be pulling into like..."
01:24:51;01:24:54;"It's overpromising from the jump."
01:24:54;01:24:56;"You're on the outskirts of the like"
01:24:56;01:24:58;"power center parking lot."
01:24:58;01:25:00;"You know, you can see the like coals"
01:25:00;01:25:04;"and like the Lowe's building supply across the lot."
01:25:04;01:25:06;"And you're pulling into the parking lot"
01:25:06;01:25:08;"and it's next to the Applebee's."
01:25:08;01:25:09;"Paradise."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"I'm sorry. I'm not in paradise."
01:25:11;01:25:13;"I mean, if you have Buffett vision,"
01:25:13;01:25:14;"then you are in paradise."
01:25:14;01:25:16;"Well, and that's what's cool about the community"
01:25:16;01:25:18;"is that, you know, what Sartre said,"
01:25:18;01:25:21;"hell is other people, but heaven is other people too."
01:25:21;01:25:24;"So if I looked around at Applebee's,"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"Chipotle, whatever,"
01:25:26;01:25:28;"and I see cheeseburger in paradise,"
01:25:28;01:25:30;"I don't know if the food's going to be better,"
01:25:30;01:25:32;"but the likelihood that I run into"
01:25:32;01:25:34;"an interesting person"
01:25:34;01:25:37;"who might buy me a drink"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"and maybe hit me with some interesting stories"
01:25:39;01:25:42;"about their time sailing the seven seas"
01:25:42;01:25:46;"is much higher at cheeseburger in paradise."
01:25:46;01:25:48;"And wherever you are,"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"you know, that's a beautiful thing"
01:25:50;01:25:52;"to know that you might meet some interesting people"
01:25:52;01:25:55;"who lived according to the Dow Buffett."
01:25:55;01:25:58;"So I'm choosing the cheeseburger in paradise every time."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"Well, RIP to a legend."
01:26:00;01:26:01;"Yeah."
01:26:01;01:26:02;"It's fun going through his songs."
01:26:02;01:26:05;"We should, maybe we should do a second"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"Buffett episode where we get into"
01:26:07;01:26:08;"deeper cuts."
01:26:08;01:26:09;"Yeah. Well, and also he has plenty,"
01:26:09;01:26:12;"he has this big hit with Alan Jackson."
01:26:12;01:26:13;"It's five o'clock somewhere."
01:26:13;01:26:14;"Oh, yeah."
01:26:15;01:26:16;"That's like one of his best known songs."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"So there's plenty more."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"And actually the song,"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"the first Buffett song I ever loved"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"because Wes Miles' dad, Doug,"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"was playing a Buffett tape in the car"
01:26:25;01:26:28;"when he drove us to a Yankees game"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"was Volcano,"
01:26:30;01:26:32;"kind of a Calypso song."
01:26:32;01:26:34;"I don't know where I'm going to go"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"when the volcano blows."
01:26:36;01:26:38;"I remember hearing that being like nine or ten."
01:26:38;01:26:39;"Just be like,"
01:26:39;01:26:40;"excuse me, sir."
01:26:40;01:26:42;"What is this?"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"Yeah, I can see that really hitting hard"
01:26:44;01:26:46;"with a nine year old."
01:26:46;01:26:48;"Yeah, that's awesome."
01:26:48;01:26:50;"I don't know where I'm going to go"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"when the volcano blows."
01:26:52;01:26:55;"OK, time for the top five."
01:26:55;01:26:59;"It's time for the top five"
01:26:59;01:27:02;"on iTunes."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"This week,"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"we're just going to do the top five hits"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"of 1970."
01:27:08;01:27:10;"Why 1970?"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"That was the year that Jimmy Buffett"
01:27:12;01:27:13;"released his first album."
01:27:13;01:27:14;"All right. So here you go."
01:27:14;01:27:16;"This is the milieu"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"into which Jimmy Buffett began his career."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"It would take him seven years to really have a hit."
01:27:20;01:27:23;"But this is when he got started, 1970."
01:27:23;01:27:26;"The number five song this week in 1970,"
01:27:26;01:27:29;"Bobby Sherman with Julie,"
01:27:29;01:27:32;"Do You Love Me?"
01:27:32;01:27:42;"I don't think I know this."
01:27:42;01:27:45;"Being alone at night"
01:27:45;01:27:48;"makes me sad, girl."
01:27:48;01:27:54;"Yet brings me down, all right."
01:27:54;01:27:57;"Tossing and turning"
01:27:57;01:28:00;"and freezing and burning"
01:28:00;01:28:03;"and crying all through the night."
01:28:03;01:28:06;"I don't know anything about Bobby Sherman."
01:28:06;01:28:11;"Julie, Julie, Julie, do you love me?"
01:28:11;01:28:15;"Julie, Julie, Julie, do you care?"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"I'm getting the sense that this songwriter,"
01:28:17;01:28:21;"Tom Baylor, wrote songs."
01:28:21;01:28:24;"He says he wrote songs for Frank Sinatra."
01:28:24;01:28:26;"Yeah, I guess he was a successful,"
01:28:26;01:28:28;"successful L.A.-based songwriter."
01:28:28;01:28:31;"She's Out of My Life, Michael Jackson."
01:28:31;01:28:34;"I think that's on Off the Wall."
01:28:34;01:28:36;"Yeah."
01:28:36;01:28:43;"I was sure that you were mine."
01:28:43;01:28:46;"But leaving you, baby,"
01:28:46;01:28:49;"is driving me crazy."
01:28:49;01:28:50;"It's got me wearing on."
01:28:50;01:28:51;"What's weird is that, like,"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"it's sort of like a similar arrangement"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"to what you might hear from the '50s,"
01:28:55;01:28:58;"but, like, yeah, with different instrumentation,"
01:28:58;01:29:01;"like, that really plucky bass and, like, yeah."
01:29:01;01:29:05;"Julie, Julie, Julie, do you care?"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"Here's a little fun tidbit"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"that you'll like about Sherman."
01:29:09;01:29:11;"That Bobby Sherman became"
01:29:11;01:29:14;"a reserve deputy sheriff in 1999"
01:29:14;01:29:18;"with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department."
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Oh, nice."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"I like that."
01:29:22;01:29:24;"He left the public spotlight"
01:29:24;01:29:27;"and became a paramedic and a police officer."
01:29:27;01:29:29;"In 1999?"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"How old was he at that point?"
01:29:31;01:29:32;"Like, in his 50s?"
01:29:32;01:29:33;"Like, that's crazy."
01:29:33;01:29:35;"Yeah, he was in his 50s."
01:29:35;01:29:39;"Remember, I'll be back September."
01:29:39;01:29:41;"His first single was called Judy,"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"You'll Never Know."
01:29:43;01:29:44;"So I wonder if he was like,"
01:29:44;01:29:45;"""I need another hit."""
01:29:45;01:29:46;"And he was like, ""All right,"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"how about we do something in the vein of"
01:29:48;01:29:49;"Judy, You'll Never Know."""
01:29:49;01:29:51;"And then he wrote a song called"
01:29:51;01:29:54;"Jody, Check This Out."
01:29:54;01:29:55;"Oh, and flopped."
01:29:55;01:29:57;"Jamie, what's up?"
01:29:57;01:29:58;"Joni, I love you."
01:29:58;01:30:01;"Janet, I'm hungry."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"The number four song this week."
01:30:03;01:30:05;"Clarence Carter with Patches."
01:30:05;01:30:06;"Oh, I know this song."
01:30:06;01:30:07;"It's about like a..."
01:30:07;01:30:09;"Oh, yeah, it's about growing up poor."
01:30:09;01:30:11;"On a farm way back up in the woods"
01:30:11;01:30:14;"I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches"
01:30:14;01:30:16;"Papa used to tease me by the coast"
01:30:16;01:30:17;"Deep down inside he was hurt"
01:30:17;01:30:20;"'Cause he'd done all he could"
01:30:20;01:30:23;"My papa was a great old man"
01:30:23;01:30:26;"I can't kind of picture either of these songs"
01:30:26;01:30:28;"being played in any situation."
01:30:28;01:30:29;"Yeah, this is a big hit."
01:30:29;01:30:31;"They kind of go together."
01:30:31;01:30:33;"Yeah, it won the 1970 Grammy Award"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"for Best Rhythm and Blues Song."
01:30:35;01:30:37;"He's really paid the bills we made"
01:30:37;01:30:40;"Old life had kicked him down to the ground"
01:30:40;01:30:43;"When he tried to get up life would kick him back down"
01:30:43;01:30:46;"One day papa called me to his dining bay"
01:30:46;01:30:49;"Put his hands on my shoulder and in tears he said"
01:30:49;01:30:53;"He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you, son"
01:30:53;01:30:56;"To pull the family through"
01:30:56;01:31:01;"My son, it's all left up to you."""
01:31:01;01:31:07;"Two days later papa passed away"
01:31:07;01:31:10;"And I became a man that day"
01:31:10;01:31:13;"So I told mama I was gonna quit school"
01:31:13;01:31:16;"But she said that was daddy's strictest rule"
01:31:16;01:31:19;"So every morning before I went to school"
01:31:19;01:31:22;"I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too"
01:31:22;01:31:25;"Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on"
01:31:25;01:31:28;"I wanted to leave, just run away from home"
01:31:28;01:31:31;"But I would remember what my daddy said"
01:31:31;01:31:34;"But till then I was dying, daddy said"
01:31:34;01:31:38;"Patches, I'm depending on you, son"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"I tried to do my best"
01:31:40;01:31:44;"His dad died and now he's working his ass off"
01:31:44;01:31:47;"He's gotta wake up before school and chop the wood"
01:31:47;01:31:50;"A song about tough rural life."
01:31:50;01:31:54;"One day a strong rain came and washed all the crops away"
01:31:54;01:31:58;"And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"The weight of the whole world on my shoulders"
01:32:00;01:32:03;"And you know mama knew what I was going through"
01:32:03;01:32:07;"'Cause every day I had to work the fields"
01:32:07;01:32:10;"'Cause that's the only way we got our meals, see"
01:32:10;01:32:13;"I was the oldest of the family"
01:32:13;01:32:16;"And everybody else depended on me"
01:32:16;01:32:19;"Every night I heard my mama pray, ""Lord!"""
01:32:19;01:32:22;"I love the way he sings, like, the fields, the grass"
01:32:22;01:32:24;"Yeah, it's an interesting melody"
01:32:24;01:32:27;"The ages took mama to a brand new home"
01:32:27;01:32:30;"Lord knows, people, I shedded tears"
01:32:30;01:32:33;"But my daddy's voice kept me through the years"
01:32:33;01:32:37;"Saying, ""Patches, I'm depending on you, son"""
01:32:37;01:32:42;"So the guy who wrote this song, his name was General Johnson"
01:32:42;01:32:45;"And he was the lead singer of Chairman of the Board"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"I love Chairman of the Board"
01:32:47;01:32:50;"Yeah, it's an interesting song"
01:32:50;01:32:53;"No easy answers, you know, Patches just"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"He was born into tough circumstances"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"They're just barely hanging on"
01:32:57;01:32:59;"Yeah, and then his dad died, life got harder"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"And it sounds like life always stayed hard"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"But he got through"
01:33:03;01:33:06;"I mean, lyrically, it's like an old country song or something"
01:33:06;01:33:10;"It's like a Merle Haggard song about, like, the family coming to, like"
01:33:10;01:33:14;"Leaving the Dust Bowl and, like, going to California during the Depression"
01:33:14;01:33:17;"Or it's like a song about just basically subsistence living"
01:33:17;01:33:18;"Like, hey, there's no big reward or anything"
01:33:18;01:33:20;"Just keep on working"
01:33:20;01:33:21;"Keep grinding"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"And remember what your dad said"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"We're dependent on you, Patches"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"I guess it's also a song about acceptance"
01:33:27;01:33:30;"He was so ragged, people called him Patches"
01:33:30;01:33:32;"And it sounds like the name stuck"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"The rest of his life, his dad was kind of like"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"Alright, man, you're Patches"
01:33:36;01:33:37;"It is what it is"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"Just do your best"
01:33:39;01:33:42;"I wondered if this was going to end up being like"
01:33:42;01:33:44;"And now nobody calls me Patches anymore"
01:33:45;01:33:48;"Or now I provided something for my family"
01:33:48;01:33:50;"I just bought my house north of Richmond"
01:33:50;01:33:51;"Yeah"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"Nope, still Patches"
01:33:53;01:33:55;"I vaguely remember the song"
01:33:55;01:33:58;"Somewhat similar as Dolly Parton's ""Coat of Many Colors"""
01:33:58;01:33:59;"Yes"
01:33:59;01:34:00;"Maybe throw that on"
01:34:00;01:34:02;"Another song about having Patchwork clothes"
01:34:02;01:34:04;"One is only poor"
01:34:04;01:34:06;"Only if they choose to be"
01:34:06;01:34:08;"""Coat of Many Colors"" came out one year later"
01:34:08;01:34:10;"Maybe she was inspired by Patches"
01:34:10;01:34:12;"Back through the years"
01:34:13;01:34:15;"I go wondering once again"
01:34:15;01:34:20;"Back to the seasons of my youth"
01:34:20;01:34:25;"I recall a box of rags that someone gave us"
01:34:25;01:34:31;"And how my mama put the rags to use"
01:34:31;01:34:35;"There were rags of many colors"
01:34:35;01:34:36;"Patches"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"Every piece was small"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"And I didn't have a coat"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"And it was a way down in the fall"
01:34:43;01:34:46;"Mama sewed the rags together"
01:34:46;01:34:49;"Sewing every piece with love"
01:34:49;01:34:52;"She made my coat of many colors"
01:34:52;01:34:56;"That I was so proud of"
01:34:56;01:34:59;"As she sewed she told a story"
01:34:59;01:35:02;"From the Bible she had read"
01:35:02;01:35:05;"About a coat of many colors"
01:35:05;01:35:08;"Joseph Warren then she said"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"Perhaps this coat will bring you"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"Good luck and happiness"
01:35:13;01:35:16;"And I just couldn't wait to wear it"
01:35:16;01:35:20;"And mama blessed it with a kiss"
01:35:20;01:35:23;"My coat of many colors"
01:35:23;01:35:26;"That my mama made for me"
01:35:26;01:35:29;"Made only from rags"
01:35:29;01:35:33;"But I wore it so proudly"
01:35:33;01:35:36;"Although we had no money"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"I wore as rich as I could be"
01:35:39;01:35:42;"In my coat of many colors"
01:35:42;01:35:45;"My mama made for me"
01:35:45;01:35:46;"So sweet"
01:35:46;01:35:49;"Yeah, the wide-eyed wonder of the kid"
01:35:49;01:35:51;"Yeah, looks at their parents with"
01:35:51;01:35:53;"So it patches on my britches"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"And holds in both my shoes"
01:35:55;01:35:58;"In my coat of many colors"
01:35:58;01:35:59;"Wearing the coat"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"I hurried off to school"
01:36:01;01:36:02;"To school, uh-oh"
01:36:02;01:36:04;"Just to find the others laughing"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"In my coat of many colors"
01:36:07;01:36:10;"My mama made for me"
01:36:10;01:36:14;"And oh, I couldn't understand it"
01:36:14;01:36:17;"For I felt I was rich"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"And I told them all the love"
01:36:19;01:36:22;"My mama sewed in every stitch"
01:36:22;01:36:25;"And I told them all the story"
01:36:25;01:36:28;"Mama told me while she sewed"
01:36:28;01:36:31;"And how my coat of many colors"
01:36:31;01:36:34;"Was worth more than all their clothes"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"Hell yeah"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"But they didn't understand it"
01:36:38;01:36:41;"And I tried to make them see"
01:36:41;01:36:44;"That one is only poor"
01:36:44;01:36:47;"Only if they choose to be"
01:36:47;01:36:51;"Now I know we had no money"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"But I was rich as I could be"
01:36:53;01:36:56;"In my coat of many colors"
01:36:56;01:36:59;"My mama made for me"
01:36:59;01:37:02;"Made just for me"
01:37:02;01:37:05;"Made just for me"
01:37:05;01:37:06;"The saddest part of this song"
01:37:06;01:37:08;"Is that when she went to school"
01:37:08;01:37:10;"In this coat her mama made her"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"Out of rags feeling so excited"
01:37:12;01:37:14;"And the kids were making fun of her"
01:37:14;01:37:16;"One of the kids who was especially cruel"
01:37:16;01:37:18;"Was Patches"
01:37:18;01:37:20;"And it just goes to show how"
01:37:20;01:37:22;"People sometimes project"
01:37:22;01:37:25;"Their own insecurity onto other people"
01:37:25;01:37:26;"She was like Patches"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"I thought if anybody would understand"
01:37:28;01:37:29;"It'd be you"
01:37:29;01:37:30;"And he was like no"
01:37:30;01:37:31;"Your coat looks like s***"
01:37:31;01:37:32;"That's a little bit of irony man"
01:37:32;01:37:33;"I might be kind of ragged"
01:37:33;01:37:35;"But your whole coat is made"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"I have a few patches on"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"But your whole coat is made of patches"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"But my mama sewed these with love"
01:37:41;01:37:42;"With every stitch"
01:37:42;01:37:44;"I like that the kid in this song"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"Seems unperturbed"
01:37:46;01:37:47;"Like these kids are just like"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"Haha look at your s*** coat"
01:37:49;01:37:50;"And she's like no no no"
01:37:50;01:37:51;"This is a great coat"
01:37:51;01:37:52;"My mom made it"
01:37:52;01:37:53;"It's like oh your mom made it"
01:37:53;01:37:54;"No no you don't understand"
01:37:54;01:37:55;"My mama told me the Bible story"
01:37:55;01:37:57;"About Joseph"
01:37:57;01:37:58;"And they're just kind of like"
01:37:58;01:37:59;"Oh my god who cares"
01:37:59;01:38:01;"And she's like whatever guys"
01:38:01;01:38:02;"We'll see you tomorrow"
01:38:02;01:38:03;"Rich is a mindset"
01:38:03;01:38:04;"You guys are wearing this"
01:38:04;01:38:06;"This factory made"
01:38:06;01:38:07;"Pablum that's coming off"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"The assembly line"
01:38:09;01:38:10;"You all look the same"
01:38:10;01:38:11;"You're all conformists"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"I'm Dolly Parton"
01:38:13;01:38:14;"That's right"
01:38:14;01:38:15;"One is only poor"
01:38:15;01:38:16;"If they choose to be"
01:38:16;01:38:18;"My mama showed me"
01:38:18;01:38:19;"Videos about how to get"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"Your grind set right"
01:38:21;01:38:24;"My mama showed me videos about how"
01:38:24;01:38:25;"By working hard you can make"
01:38:25;01:38:28;"$50,000 a month"
01:38:28;01:38:29;"Through drop shipping"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"So"
01:38:31;01:38:33;"I have a growth mindset"
01:38:33;01:38:35;"My mom loves the YouTube"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"Pre-roll ads"
01:38:37;01:38:40;"[Laughter]"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"She shows me all of them"
01:38:42;01:38:43;"As far as I'm concerned"
01:38:43;01:38:44;"I could have a Lamborghini"
01:38:44;01:38:45;"You guys are the poor ones"
01:38:45;01:38:46;"Because you don't have a grind set"
01:38:46;01:38:48;"What color is your Bugatti"
01:38:48;01:38:49;"That's right"
01:38:49;01:38:51;"In the Bugatti"
01:38:51;01:38:53;"My mama made for me"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"Yeah but truly a beautiful song"
01:38:55;01:38:57;"And I mean they always talk about"
01:38:57;01:38:59;"The great rural purge"
01:38:59;01:39:02;"Where the Illuminati"
01:39:02;01:39:03;"Or whoever got all the"
01:39:03;01:39:05;"Rural shows off the air"
01:39:05;01:39:06;"Because there used to be a time"
01:39:06;01:39:08;"Where like half the shows on TV"
01:39:08;01:39:10;"Were something about country living"
01:39:10;01:39:12;"The Waltons, Green Acres"
01:39:12;01:39:13;"Whatever"
01:39:13;01:39:14;"And then they apparently"
01:39:14;01:39:16;"They cancelled them all one season"
01:39:16;01:39:17;"They called it the rural purge"
01:39:17;01:39:18;"Oh I never heard that"
01:39:18;01:39:19;"Wow"
01:39:19;01:39:20;"Like in the mid"
01:39:20;01:39:21;"In the late 70s early 80s"
01:39:21;01:39:22;"Let me do a number crunch on that"
01:39:22;01:39:23;"I'm thinking like Dukes of Hazzard"
01:39:23;01:39:24;"And"
01:39:24;01:39:26;"The rural purge of American"
01:39:26;01:39:27;"Television networks"
01:39:27;01:39:28;"Was a series of cancellations"
01:39:28;01:39:30;"In the early 70s"
01:39:30;01:39:32;"Of still popular"
01:39:32;01:39:33;"Rural themed shows"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"With demographically skewed audiences"
01:39:35;01:39:37;"The majority of which occurred"
01:39:37;01:39:38;"At the end of the 1970s"
01:39:38;01:39:40;"'71 television season"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"Exactly when these songs came out"
01:39:42;01:39:43;"In addition to rural themed shows"
01:39:43;01:39:45;"Such as Mayberry, RFD"
01:39:45;01:39:46;"The Beverly Hillbillies"
01:39:46;01:39:47;"Petticoat Junction"
01:39:47;01:39:48;"And Green Acres"
01:39:48;01:39:49;"The cancellations ended"
01:39:49;01:39:51;"Several highly rated variety shows"
01:39:51;01:39:52;"That had been on CBS"
01:39:52;01:39:54;"Since the beginning of television broadcast"
01:39:54;01:39:55;"Hmm"
01:39:55;01:39:56;"Maybe this is the beginning"
01:39:56;01:39:57;"Of just like the"
01:39:57;01:39:58;"Two Americas"
01:39:58;01:39:59;"Right all those affluent"
01:39:59;01:40:00;"Suburbanites"
01:40:00;01:40:02;"Who are spending the money"
01:40:02;01:40:03;"That the ad sponsors"
01:40:03;01:40:05;"Are responding to"
01:40:05;01:40:07;"They weren't watching Green Acres"
01:40:07;01:40:09;"Gomer Pyle was the first to leave"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"The first cancellation"
01:40:11;01:40:12;"They say it's Jim Neighbors"
01:40:12;01:40:13;"That left that"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"Also the Andy Griffith show"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"All this was mostly happening"
01:40:17;01:40:18;"At CBS"
01:40:18;01:40:19;"CBS aired so many of these"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"Rural themed shows"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"That it gained the nickname"
01:40:23;01:40:26;"The country broadcasting system"
01:40:26;01:40:28;"And the hillbilly network"
01:40:28;01:40:29;"You can imagine"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"Because we're a CBS based"
01:40:31;01:40:32;"Probably New York or LA"
01:40:32;01:40:33;"I'm sure New York"
01:40:33;01:40:34;"Yeah maybe New York"
01:40:34;01:40:36;"You can imagine that probably"
01:40:36;01:40:38;"Yeah the coastal elites"
01:40:38;01:40:39;"Working their"
01:40:39;01:40:40;"Kind of high status job"
01:40:40;01:40:41;"Being one of the big three"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"TV stations at the time"
01:40:43;01:40:45;"But maybe it just didn't jive"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"With their kind of madman lifestyle"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"So it says that there was a"
01:40:49;01:40:50;"There was a bit of a war"
01:40:50;01:40:51;"Within CBS"
01:40:51;01:40:53;"About all these shows"
01:40:53;01:40:54;"And that there was a guy"
01:40:54;01:40:56;"Who didn't like the shows"
01:40:56;01:40:57;"Michael Dan"
01:40:57;01:40:58;"But he kept them on the air"
01:40:58;01:41:00;"Because they had strong ratings"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"And then the incoming president"
01:41:02;01:41:03;"Of CBS Robert Wood"
01:41:03;01:41:06;"Pressured him to cancel the programs"
01:41:06;01:41:08;"But he even though he was like"
01:41:08;01:41:09;"Listen man I'm not a fan of these"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"And he said to the boss"
01:41:11;01:41:12;"Just because the people"
01:41:12;01:41:13;"Who buy refrigerators"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"Are between 26 and 35"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"And live in Scarsdale"
01:41:17;01:41:18;"You should not beam your programming"
01:41:18;01:41:20;"Only at them"
01:41:20;01:41:21;"And then he was fired"
01:41:21;01:41:23;"Wow he was kind of a visionary"
01:41:23;01:41:24;"Yeah maybe a guy was like"
01:41:24;01:41:26;"I don't care what kind of numbers"
01:41:26;01:41:26;"You're putting up"
01:41:26;01:41:27;"They're spending more money"
01:41:27;01:41:29;"On the coasts"
01:41:29;01:41:32;"And those rural eyeballs"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"Are not worth as much"
01:41:34;01:41:35;"To our sponsors"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"As other eyeballs"
01:41:37;01:41:38;"And he's like come on man"
01:41:38;01:41:40;"That's so madman dude"
01:41:40;01:41:43;"Between 26 and 35 in Scarsdale"
01:41:43;01:41:44;"I mean look it's probably"
01:41:44;01:41:45;"The same conversation"
01:41:45;01:41:47;"That was had around Yellowstone"
01:41:47;01:41:49;"Without a doubt"
01:41:49;01:41:51;"Which had a hard time getting made"
01:41:51;01:41:52;"Really"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"That's a huge hit though right"
01:41:55;01:41:56;"Yes it's a huge hit"
01:41:56;01:41:57;"But it was like"
01:41:57;01:41:58;"Who's going to take a chance"
01:41:58;01:41:59;"That's what I'm saying"
01:41:59;01:42:00;"It's like are we going to"
01:42:00;01:42:01;"Make this show or not"
01:42:01;01:42:02;"You know there's a song"
01:42:02;01:42:03;"Okay so a guy named"
01:42:03;01:42:05;"Country singer Roy Clark"
01:42:05;01:42:07;"Wrote a song in response"
01:42:07;01:42:09;"To the rural purge"
01:42:09;01:42:11;"Called the Lawrence Welk"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"He hawk counter revolution polka"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"Which made me throw this on"
01:42:15;01:42:17;"The phrasing of the revival"
01:42:17;01:42:18;"Of the two programs"
01:42:18;01:42:19;"As counter revolution"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"May be a nod to the revolution"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"Will not be televised"
01:42:24;01:42:24;"Hmm"
01:42:25;01:42:30;"We're going through a music revolution"
01:42:30;01:42:34;"The hippies say they'll overcome us all"
01:42:34;01:42:36;"But while they're blowing smoke"
01:42:36;01:42:38;"And air pollution"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"We're hanging on with help"
01:42:40;01:42:42;"From Geritol"
01:42:42;01:42:44;"They're rounding up"
01:42:44;01:42:46;"The squares in California"
01:42:46;01:42:48;"Rounding up the squares"
01:42:48;01:42:49;"They're picking off our heroes"
01:42:49;01:42:51;"In New York"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"But they'll never take us all"
01:42:53;01:42:55;"They'll never take away"
01:42:55;01:42:57;"Our champagne music"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"As long as Lawrence Welk"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"Can pop his cork"
01:43:01;01:43:03;"[whistling]"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"And they still do the polka"
01:43:08;01:43:10;"In Milwaukee"
01:43:10;01:43:12;"Still do the waltz"
01:43:12;01:43:15;"In Tennessee"
01:43:15;01:43:17;"Still picking bluegrass"
01:43:17;01:43:19;"In Kentucky"
01:43:19;01:43:23;"With old fashioned country harmony"
01:43:23;01:43:27;"So give me some beer, drink and music"
01:43:27;01:43:31;"And play that double eagle march for me"
01:43:31;01:43:33;"For they still do the polka"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"In Milwaukee"
01:43:35;01:43:39;"So let me hear that one or two or three"
01:43:39;01:43:42;"Wow, silent majority"
01:43:42;01:43:44;"The big wheels at the network"
01:43:44;01:43:46;"Started spinning"
01:43:46;01:43:48;"The verdict was that he hawk"
01:43:48;01:43:50;"Had to go to the polls"
01:43:50;01:43:53;"And the six years don't make a difference"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"And who the heck needs polka"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"In New America"
01:44:00;01:44:02;"They canceled all the singing"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"And the picking"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"But the stubborn little donkey"
01:44:06;01:44:08;"Wouldn't leave"
01:44:08;01:44:10;"And that little fella"
01:44:10;01:44:12;"Still alive and kicking"
01:44:12;01:44:15;"And he haws laughing up his sleeve"
01:44:15;01:44:17;"He haw!"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"And they still do the polka"
01:44:22;01:44:24;"In Milwaukee"
01:44:24;01:44:26;"Still do the waltz"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"In Tennessee"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"Still picking bluegrass"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"In Kentucky"
01:44:32;01:44:36;"With old fashioned country harmony"
01:44:36;01:44:40;"So give me some beer, drink and music"
01:44:40;01:44:44;"And let me hear that one or two or three"
01:44:44;01:44:48;"While we swing to that good old country music"
01:44:48;01:44:52;"For he haw is good enough"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"For me"
01:44:54;01:44:58;"Yes, he haw is good enough for me"
01:45:01;01:45:02;"Wow"
01:45:02;01:45:05;"Ironically, that was a somewhat psychedelic piece of music"
01:45:05;01:45:06;"That is true"
01:45:06;01:45:09;"It was an interesting collage sound effect"
01:45:09;01:45:11;"Like demented circus music"
01:45:11;01:45:13;"That's really interesting"
01:45:13;01:45:15;"I gotta say, I mean, they really call it out"
01:45:15;01:45:17;"Like they're rounding up the squares in California"
01:45:17;01:45:19;"I mean, yeah, I guess it's the culture war"
01:45:19;01:45:21;"Has been going on forever"
01:45:21;01:45:22;"It's been brewing"
01:45:22;01:45:24;"And you know, there definitely is an element of it"
01:45:24;01:45:25;"That is truly a culture war"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"Like obviously there's so many elements of it"
01:45:27;01:45:31;"That have to do with like deep set belief systems"
01:45:31;01:45:33;"Which belief system is gonna win"
01:45:33;01:45:35;"How do you treat people, all that stuff"
01:45:35;01:45:36;"That's legitimate"
01:45:36;01:45:38;"But there's also another part of it"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"That really is just us versus them"
01:45:40;01:45:42;"Who's gonna be in charge of what's on TV"
01:45:42;01:45:45;"I guess today, it's less of an issue"
01:45:45;01:45:47;"But back then, it really was like"
01:45:47;01:45:49;"Do I wanna, is it gonna be shows"
01:45:49;01:45:51;"Who gets to get represented?"
01:45:51;01:45:51;"There's three channels"
01:45:51;01:45:53;"And you know, even back then"
01:45:53;01:45:54;"Obviously there's the racial element"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"But some of it was just between white people too"
01:45:56;01:45:59;"Do I wanna turn on TV and watch"
01:45:59;01:46:01;"Everything being about rural life"
01:46:01;01:46:02;"And southern accents"
01:46:02;01:46:04;"Or do I wanna watch like"
01:46:04;01:46:09;"A more urbane, kinda northeastern type show"
01:46:09;01:46:11;"Or you know, a Los Angeles cop show"
01:46:11;01:46:12;"Or whatever, you know?"
01:46:12;01:46:13;"Yeah"
01:46:13;01:46:14;"Back then, there was only"
01:46:14;01:46:17;"There were only so many slots available"
01:46:17;01:46:19;"I guess those rich men north of Richmond"
01:46:20;01:46:21;"Made their decision"
01:46:21;01:46:22;"And I bet they were sort of like"
01:46:22;01:46:24;"Also like, I mean, this, you know"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"Like this rural life in America"
01:46:26;01:46:28;"It's overrepresented on TV"
01:46:28;01:46:30;"We don't need nine shows"
01:46:30;01:46:31;"Maybe it was"
01:46:31;01:46:32;"Yeah, I don't know"
01:46:32;01:46:33;"Was it overrepresented?"
01:46:33;01:46:34;"Yeah, maybe it was"
01:46:34;01:46:35;"I don't know"
01:46:35;01:46:36;"Was it overrepresented"
01:46:36;01:46:37;"Or was it just like"
01:46:37;01:46:39;"New Yorkers being like"
01:46:39;01:46:40;"Being like, these just suck"
01:46:40;01:46:41;"It kinda reminds me of like"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"The electoral college"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"How like some small swing states"
01:46:45;01:46:48;"Have this like inordinate power"
01:46:49;01:46:50;"I.e. they're overrepresented"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"In elections"
01:46:52;01:46:53;"Right"
01:46:53;01:46:54;"I'm just trying to think"
01:46:54;01:46:55;"Is there anything you can remember"
01:46:55;01:46:56;"Watching from this period?"
01:46:56;01:46:58;"I mean, I'll crunch some numbers"
01:46:58;01:46:59;"But you know what I think of it"
01:46:59;01:47:01;"They are all like Andy Griffith"
01:47:01;01:47:03;"When we were kids on Nick and Knight"
01:47:03;01:47:06;"Green Acres was on constantly"
01:47:06;01:47:08;"A lot of people like roughly my age"
01:47:08;01:47:11;"Like have seen, you know"
01:47:11;01:47:13;"50 episodes of Green Acres"
01:47:13;01:47:15;"Although Green Acres was funny because"
01:47:15;01:47:17;"That was about urbane New Yorkers"
01:47:18;01:47:19;"Who moved to the country"
01:47:19;01:47:21;"Like I remember the opening credits"
01:47:21;01:47:23;"Were about kinda like"
01:47:23;01:47:24;"The wife being like"
01:47:24;01:47:25;"I like shopping at Tiffany's"
01:47:25;01:47:26;"And now here I am"
01:47:26;01:47:27;"Like out in the country"
01:47:27;01:47:29;"With a pitchfork kind of thing"
01:47:29;01:47:30;"But I mean, literally"
01:47:30;01:47:32;"There is Beverly Hillbillies"
01:47:32;01:47:33;"I remember well"
01:47:33;01:47:34;"Yeehaw"
01:47:34;01:47:36;"When Beverly Hillbillies took place"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"In Beverly Hills"
01:47:38;01:47:39;"Yes"
01:47:39;01:47:41;"So there's something for everybody there"
01:47:41;01:47:42;"Well anyway, on the airwaves"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"People were still singing about rural life"
01:47:44;01:47:46;"And I guess the reason I thought of that"
01:47:47;01:47:49;"Is that, and maybe that's partially why"
01:47:49;01:47:51;"Oliver Anthony speaks to people"
01:47:51;01:47:54;"It's very rare that anything about rural life"
01:47:54;01:47:57;"Makes it to the top of the billboard charts"
01:47:57;01:47:58;"Right"
01:47:58;01:48:00;"You know, like International Harvester"
01:48:00;01:48:03;"Is so specifically about being a farmer"
01:48:03;01:48:05;"With your machine or whatever"
01:48:05;01:48:07;"That was not gonna be a crossover hit"
01:48:07;01:48:09;"And even country songs that do crossover"
01:48:09;01:48:12;"Historically have not been"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"Too much about rural life"
01:48:15;01:48:17;"It's supposed to be about the universal side of stuff"
01:48:17;01:48:18;"Heartbreak"
01:48:18;01:48:19;"Cheer up boys"
01:48:19;01:48:20;"Yeah, and drinking"
01:48:20;01:48:21;"They drink everywhere"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"Hearts are broken everywhere"
01:48:23;01:48:26;"But like the real specific rural stuff"
01:48:26;01:48:27;"And even"
01:48:27;01:48:29;"You could even have a pretty general song"
01:48:29;01:48:30;"About living in poverty"
01:48:30;01:48:31;"Or growing up poor"
01:48:31;01:48:32;"Or believing in yourself"
01:48:32;01:48:35;"But these songs are so specific"
01:48:35;01:48:37;"Like Code of Many Colors"
01:48:37;01:48:38;"I mean, of course"
01:48:38;01:48:40;"Anybody could relate to these songs"
01:48:40;01:48:41;"Anybody"
01:48:41;01:48:42;"Even if you go broad enough"
01:48:42;01:48:43;"Even somebody who grew up"
01:48:44;01:48:45;"With a silver spoon in their mouth"
01:48:45;01:48:47;"Could relate to Code of Many Colors"
01:48:47;01:48:49;"Or even Patches"
01:48:49;01:48:51;"I mean Patches is just straight up"
01:48:51;01:48:52;"Like sharecropping"
01:48:52;01:48:53;"Yeah"
01:48:53;01:48:55;"But it's also about losing a parent"
01:48:55;01:48:56;"At a young age"
01:48:56;01:48:57;"And like, you know"
01:48:57;01:48:59;"Kind of having their voice in your head"
01:48:59;01:49:01;"As like some form of guidance"
01:49:01;01:49:02;"And Code of Many Colors"
01:49:02;01:49:03;"Is also about like"
01:49:03;01:49:06;"That disconnect that everybody has to realize"
01:49:06;01:49:07;"It's like"
01:49:07;01:49:09;"Not everybody's gonna understand you"
01:49:09;01:49:11;"Or like what you believe in"
01:49:11;01:49:13;"Alright, let's keep moving"
01:49:13;01:49:16;"I have a song this week in 70"
01:49:16;01:49:17;"CCR"
01:49:17;01:49:18;"Creedence Clearwater Revival"
01:49:18;01:49:20;"""Looking Out My Back Door"""
01:49:20;01:49:21;"Perfect"
01:49:21;01:49:23;"CCR obviously is from"
01:49:23;01:49:24;"San Francisco or whatever"
01:49:24;01:49:26;"But they were trying to be rural"
01:49:26;01:49:27;"Yeah"
01:49:27;01:49:28;"It's funny"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"This is like a very rural top five so far"
01:49:30;01:49:37;"And even this song"
01:49:37;01:49:39;"In particular is rural"
01:49:39;01:49:41;"He has a back door"
01:49:41;01:49:42;"He's looking out his back door"
01:49:42;01:49:43;"I have a back door"
01:49:43;01:49:44;"Not all"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"Took my singing"
01:49:46;01:49:49;"Thank God I'm a country boy"
01:49:49;01:49:51;"With a back door"
01:49:51;01:49:54;"Well this is like the psychedelic world"
01:49:54;01:49:55;"Yeah"
01:49:55;01:49:56;"He's tripping"
01:49:56;01:49:57;"Right"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"From the album Cosmos Factory"
01:49:59;01:50:00;"Right"
01:50:00;01:50:01;"Such a good song though"
01:50:01;01:50:03;"Who doesn't love Creedence?"
01:50:03;01:50:05;"Listening to Buck Owens"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"Yeah you gotta be kind of"
01:50:07;01:50:08;"Messed up in the heads"
01:50:08;01:50:09;"On that like Creedence"
01:50:09;01:50:11;"""Hamburgeons and elephants"""
01:50:11;01:50:13;"""Are playing in the band"""

01:50:17;01:50:18;"Oh of course"
01:50:18;01:50:19;"Okay this is a big song"
01:50:19;01:50:20;"No I know it was a big song"
01:50:20;01:50:21;"They played this on the radio"
01:50:21;01:50:22;"I mean I knew all the music"
01:50:22;01:50:24;"But Jake's not listening to the radio"
01:50:24;01:50:25;"In the 70s"
01:50:25;01:50:28;"No but I was in the 80s and 90s"
01:50:28;01:50:29;"Oldies"
01:50:29;01:50:30;"Classic rock"
01:50:30;01:50:31;"For sure"
01:50:31;01:50:33;"Also we had that Chronicle"
01:50:33;01:50:35;"That you know that CCR Chronicle"
01:50:35;01:50:36;"20 greatest hits"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"CD or tape or whatever"
01:50:38;01:50:40;"So many great songs"

01:51:00;01:51:02;"Nor had I heard the Kenny Rogers"
01:51:02;01:51:03;"That definitely introduced that song"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"To a whole new generation"
01:51:05;01:51:06;"Yeah"
01:51:07;01:51:10;"Number two song this week"

01:51:53;01:51:55;"Oh yeah that'd be too"
01:51:55;01:51:56;"This is what I'm sure to do it on"
01:51:56;01:51:57;"I'm just kidding"
01:51:57;01:51:58;"I have no idea what Bruce is"
01:51:58;01:52:00;"I mean he was definitely doing it"
01:52:00;01:52:01;"In the 80s"

01:55:10;01:55:12;"My love is alive"
01:55:12;01:55:15;"It's like a seed"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"That only needs the thought of you"
01:55:17;01:55:19;"To grow"
01:55:19;01:55:22;"So if you feel the need for company"
01:55:22;01:55:24;"Please my darling"

01:55:39;01:55:41;"I've never noticed that"
01:55:41;01:55:42;"You know it's funny"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"I didn't even realize this was the same song"
01:55:44;01:55:45;"As the Marvin Gaye team's"
01:55:45;01:55:46;"Right"
01:55:46;01:55:49;"Like I never consciously put that together"
01:55:49;01:55:51;"I think they do it at the very end of the song"
01:55:51;01:55:53;"If I remember"
01:55:53;01:55:56;"I may not be able to express"
01:55:56;01:55:58;"The depth"
01:55:58;01:56:01;"Of the love I feel for you"
01:56:01;01:56:04;"But a writer put it very nicely"
01:56:04;01:56:06;"When he was away"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"So much talking"
01:56:08;01:56:09;"From a great singer"
01:56:09;01:56:11;"He sat down and wrote these words"
01:56:11;01:56:12;"No wind"
01:56:12;01:56:13;"No rain"
01:56:14;01:56:16;"No rain"
01:56:16;01:56:19;"Oh winter's cold"
01:56:19;01:56:22;"Can't stop me babe"
01:56:22;01:56:23;"Oh babe"
01:56:23;01:56:25;"Baby"
01:56:25;01:56:26;"Baby"
01:56:26;01:56:28;"If you're my gold"
01:56:28;01:56:30;"Ah"
01:56:30;01:56:31;"No wind"
01:56:31;01:56:32;"No rain"
01:56:34;01:56:36;"Can't stop me babe"
01:56:36;01:56:39;"If you're my gold"
01:56:39;01:56:41;"Oh"
01:56:41;01:56:44;"So this is 1970"
01:56:44;01:56:47;"I wonder if this was kind of inspired by"
01:56:47;01:56:49;"Isaac Hayes' Walk on By"
01:56:49;01:56:51;"Because it's a similar kind of like"
01:56:51;01:56:54;"You know, late 60s psychedelic mindset"
01:56:54;01:56:56;"Because you know, his Walk on By"
01:56:56;01:56:59;"Is so, is this long intense epic"
01:56:59;01:57:02;"And you know the original Burt Bacharach song"
01:57:02;01:57:03;"Uh huh"
01:57:03;01:57:05;"There's like kind of like a similar thing"
01:57:05;01:57:07;"Actually can you throw on the original"
01:57:07;01:57:09;"Dionne Warwick Walk on By for a second"
01:57:09;01:57:11;"And then get the Isaac Hayes cued up"
01:57:11;01:57:18;"If you see me walking down the street"
01:57:18;01:57:20;"And I start to cry"
01:57:20;01:57:22;"You know this is, this is cool"
01:57:22;01:57:24;"But this is, you know, this is the original Walk on By"
01:57:24;01:57:26;"Is this like '67 also?"
01:57:26;01:57:28;"Yeah, with the kind of sweet"
01:57:28;01:57:30;"That classic like Burt Bacharach"
01:57:30;01:57:32;"Yeah"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"I wonder if that's Herb Alpert"
01:57:34;01:57:35;"Oh yeah, right"
01:57:35;01:57:36;"Definitely there's emotion"
01:57:36;01:57:37;"But it's, you know, it's like"
01:57:37;01:57:39;"It's a small little pop song"
01:57:39;01:57:41;"Now play the Isaac Hayes"
01:57:41;01:57:53;"And I think this version is like"
01:57:53;01:57:55;"10 minutes long or something"
01:57:55;01:57:57;"Is this also 1970?"
01:57:57;01:57:59;"This is '69, it's a year before"
01:57:59;01:58:02;"So he's like taking this kind of like"
01:58:02;01:58:04;"Simple pop song"
01:58:04;01:58:05;"But it's like"
01:58:05;01:58:07;"I mean this is one of like"
01:58:07;01:58:08;"It's a corny word to use"
01:58:08;01:58:09;"But this is like one of the most"
01:58:09;01:58:10;"Epic recordings ever"
01:58:10;01:58:12;"And it's so cool that he like"
01:58:12;01:58:13;"Took this short song"
01:58:13;01:58:14;"And then did his like"
01:58:14;01:58:17;"Really big intense version of it"
01:58:17;01:58:19;"He did his 10 minute Walk on By"
01:58:19;01:58:21;"Yeah, exactly"
01:58:21;01:58:23;"Yeah, just like taking this pop song"
01:58:23;01:58:25;"But it's so deep inside it"
01:58:26;01:58:28;"And Walk on By"
01:58:28;01:58:30;"Like even though it's the same song"
01:58:30;01:58:31;"It's like"
01:58:31;01:58:33;"It's like a different song"
01:58:55;01:58:56;"It's like a different song"
01:58:56;01:58:57;"It's like a different song"
01:59:50;01:59:51;"It's like a different song"
01:59:51;01:59:52;"It's like a different song"
02:00:17;02:00:18;"It's like a different song"
02:00:18;02:00:19;"It's like a different song"
02:01:12;02:01:13;"It's like a different song"
02:01:13;02:01:14;"It's like a different song"
02:01:39;02:01:40;"It's like a different song"
02:01:40;02:01:41;"It's like a different song"
