00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, back once again. Boy do we have some news to catch up on. We gotta talk about"
00:08;00:15;"Duncan, Duncan Donuts. We gotta talk about Stake 'Em's and their social media presence."
00:15;00:21;"We gotta talk about Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper and their new film A Star is Born."
00:21;00:27;"All this, plus much more Jim Morrison, on this week's Time Crisis."
00:27;00:33;"Ezra King. B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
01:19;01:23;"Time Crisis back again. We're gonna get right into it today. We got a lot to get through."
01:23;01:27;"TC78. This is a major time crisis. Just a lot of time"
01:27;01:31;"crisis-y stuff has been happening in the world. But Jake, you were just saying"
01:31;01:35;"something interesting before the show started. That even though"
01:35;01:39;"it might be played out, you still love the film The Big Lebowski with all"
01:39;01:43;"of your soul. -Yeah. I mean, I was saying it's played out to"
01:43;01:47;"do long, extended quotes from the film. Because I feel like"
01:47;01:51;"everyone in my life, including my parents, have that film memorized."
01:51;01:55;"-Yeah. -And so we just got a new"
01:55;01:59;"rug in our little TV room. And I was like,"
01:59;02:03;"""Hannah, I'm saying this completely sincerely. It's also"
02:03;02:07;"sort of a reference. But honestly, the rug ties the room together."" -It really does."
02:07;02:11;"-And just like an eye roll. -Right. -I mean, because I'm doing Lebowski"
02:11;02:15;"quotes daily. It is my favorite film. And"
02:15;02:19;"most of my friends are on that wavelength of having it memorized."
02:19;02:23;"So I'll make the most subtle reference. And that's how we got into this"
02:23;02:27;"before the show started. -Just making a subtle Lebowski reference."
02:27;02:31;"-Oh, a friend of ours' car was broken into. -Right. I mean, that's one of the--"
02:31;02:35;"-And I was like, ""Wouldn't hold that much hope for that tape deck."" -I think over the past few years,"
02:35;02:39;"even the concept of quoting movies has played out."
02:39;02:43;"-Yeah. -Even just quoting movies is reminiscent of"
02:43;02:47;"another era. -Why is that, you think? -I think there's been an"
02:47;02:51;"association with nonstop movie quoting as being"
02:51;02:55;"a fratty thing to do. -Oh, interesting. Fratty?"
02:55;02:59;"-You might think that everybody more or less likes movies."
02:59;03:03;"They might have wildly different tastes. -Sure. -So you would think that whoever likes movies"
03:03;03:07;"would quote the movies that they like. Maybe for you it's Big Lebowski."
03:07;03:11;"Maybe for somebody else it's Avengers Infinity War."
03:11;03:15;"-51st Date. -Which is a deeply unquotable film. -Well, I guess there's one quote that people"
03:15;03:19;"always say. What is it? ""Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good."""
03:19;03:23;"Whack quote. Come on. But anyway, I think there's almost a stereotype"
03:23;03:27;"of a frat guy who just all he can do is quote movies. -I just think it's more like"
03:27;03:31;"dorks. Which I guess frat guys are dorks. -Frat guys are the nerdy dorks."
03:31;03:35;"-A different version of dorks. Because I was a dork"
03:35;03:39;"in high school and we quoted Ghostbusters"
03:39;03:43;"and Back to the Future nonstop. And as discussed on"
03:43;03:47;"TC episode 72, my high school"
03:47;03:51;"yearbook quote was from Ghostbusters, ""Slow down and chew your food."" -Deep cut."
03:51;03:55;"A deep cut quote. -Deep cut. -But here's the thing. I love that you"
03:55;03:59;"still ride for the Big Lebowski because I think something happens when something becomes"
03:59;04:03;"a really iconic cult. It's like happening with Rick and Morty now."
04:03;04:07;"Where people are really into it and ride for it. And then it becomes a stereotype"
04:07;04:11;"of the type of person who's obsessed with that is so annoying. -Right. -And then"
04:11;04:15;"suddenly it casts this weird shadow on the thing itself. -Which it shouldn't."
04:15;04:19;"-Which it shouldn't. So I've watched some Rick and Morty and I enjoyed"
04:19;04:23;"it. But based on what I've taken in from the internet in the past"
04:23;04:27;"year, a lot of the people that I think are cool make a lot of snide remarks"
04:27;04:31;"about these straw men who are so into Rick and Morty"
04:31;04:35;"and are so annoying. -I don't get it. I love that show."
04:35;04:39;"I see people referring to"
04:39;04:43;"that. -Pickle Rick. -Yeah, people make fun of Rick and Morty fans. I'm like,"
04:43;04:47;"""It's a good show. What's your problem?"" -Well that's Jake. -You guys are overthinking it. -Because you're"
04:47;04:51;"actually cool. -Am I? -You're not fashionable but you're cool."
04:51;04:55;"You don't follow the trends of the day."

08:14;08:17;"- From time to time versus the guy who's obsessed with"
08:17;08:20;"how lame it is to quote movies, I think I'll go with the guy"
08:20;08:22;"who just quotes that movie that he likes."
08:22;08:25;"- This is a sort of a tangent, it's semi-related,"
08:25;08:27;"and maybe we're skating on thin ice here."
08:27;08:28;"- Uh oh."
08:28;08:31;"- Why do people hate Elon Musk all of a sudden?"
08:31;08:32;"- Oh God."
08:32;08:34;"- Because the guy makes the best cars,"
08:34;08:37;"I mean I don't own a Tesla, but those cars rule,"
08:37;08:40;"and there's zero emissions, and then I saw something"
08:40;08:43;"online today where Kanye was at some art school"
08:43;08:44;"or something and he was like--"
08:44;08:46;"- Leave Elon, I saw that, he's standing on some labels."
08:46;08:49;"- People were clowning on him for smoking weed on Rogan."
08:49;08:50;"(laughing)"
08:50;08:53;"And I'm like, this is tight, what's the problem?"
08:53;08:55;"- Okay, well, I guess there's a lot to unpack there."
08:55;08:56;"- I don't know the full context."
08:56;08:59;"- You know why people are souring on Kanye now, obviously."
08:59;09:00;"- Of course."
09:00;09:01;"- All right, so that's one thing."
09:01;09:05;"With Elon Musk, here's a few sentiments that I've seen."
09:05;09:07;"Yeah, hating on Elon Musk for smoking weed is whack."
09:07;09:09;"- Well, I thought of it because of Lebowski too,"
09:09;09:11;"because it's like, he was so cool for a while,"
09:11;09:13;"and then all of a sudden it became played out."
09:13;09:14;"- Flipped."
09:14;09:15;"- He just flipped."
09:15;09:20;"- I think, he has his fanboys, but you know what,"
09:20;09:23;"maybe it's because he was seen as the cool CEO for a second"
09:23;09:27;"that more people started to wake up and started to be like,"
09:27;09:29;"no CEOs are cool."
09:29;09:32;"- Look, I'm not gonna go to, I don't know the facts,"
09:32;09:35;"I just have a very cursory knowledge of him,"
09:35;09:37;"and I just was like, I remember just tracking that"
09:37;09:41;"on the internet, that all of a sudden the winds shifted"
09:41;09:43;"with Elon."
09:43;09:45;"- If it's because he smoked weed, I think that's lame,"
09:45;09:48;"'cause you know who doesn't smoke any weed"
09:48;09:49;"or drink any alcohol?"
09:49;09:51;"President of the United States, Donald J. Trump."
09:51;09:52;"- D.J. Trump."
09:52;09:54;"- Didn't we get an email or something, again,"
09:54;09:56;"there's been so much time crisis-y stuff in the news,"
09:56;10:01;"didn't Donald Trump like cheers with a Diet Coke at the UN?"
10:01;10:02;"Does that sound familiar?"
10:02;10:03;"- That sounds amazing."
10:03;10:05;"- I don't think that's an email we got."
10:05;10:08;"I mean, that sounds like something that happened,"
10:08;10:09;"but I don't remember it."
10:09;10:12;"- Man, we have so many time crisis go-to topics."
10:12;10:15;"Remember when this show started out, very quickly it became"
10:15;10:18;"that we talk about music and corporate food history."
10:18;10:22;"But as we dive deeper into each of those subcategories,"
10:22;10:24;"it's really like we could do a weekly"
10:24;10:27;"what's going on with Diet Coke, if we wanted to."
10:27;10:28;"- Oh, sure."
10:28;10:31;"- We could do a weekly what's going on with--"
10:31;10:32;"- Frito-Lay Corp."
10:33;10:35;"- We've talked about Dunkin' Donuts before."
10:35;10:36;"- Yes, we have."
10:36;10:38;"- Jake, did you hear the big news about Dunkin' Donuts?"
10:38;10:39;"- I did."
10:39;10:41;"I am very tapped in."
10:41;10:44;"Actually, the week before this announcement,"
10:44;10:47;"I was in a car with some friends, and for some reason--"
10:47;10:48;"I think it was early morning,"
10:48;10:50;"we were going down to Disneyland, actually,"
10:50;10:52;"which is a whole separate story."
10:52;10:57;"But we came up with a new slogan for Dunkin' Donuts,"
10:57;10:59;"which was ""I'm down for Dunkin'."""
10:59;11:01;"Or just ""down."""
11:01;11:05;"- Oh, like as the campaign evolves over the years?"
11:05;11:07;"- It just becomes ""down."""
11:07;11:10;"- When a corporation can own one word like that,"
11:10;11:11;"that's masterful."
11:11;11:12;"- ""Down for Dunkin'."""
11:12;11:15;"And then they changed their name to Dunkin' a week later."
11:15;11:16;"- Whoa."
11:16;11:17;"- So I was like--"
11:17;11:19;"- That's great, ""Down for Dunkin'."""
11:19;11:21;"- I think it's a great phrase."
11:21;11:24;"- Especially if you make a fun commercial."
11:24;11:25;"- ""Are you down for Dunkin'?"""
11:25;11:27;"- Yeah, and then that becomes a thing."
11:27;11:29;"You text everybody, ""Who's down for Dunkin'?"""
11:29;11:32;"- 'Cause Dunkin' Donuts, as I've said on this show,"
11:32;11:35;"is one of the chains I've always had a soft spot for."
11:35;11:36;"- Sure. East Coast."
11:36;11:39;"- Yeah, I almost considered it a heritage brand"
11:39;11:41;"of the tri-state area."
11:41;11:44;"I didn't realize that it's really a--"
11:44;11:47;"more than anything, it's a Massachusetts thing."
11:47;11:48;"- Really?"
11:48;11:49;"- It's a Boston thing."
11:49;11:50;"- Okay."
11:50;11:52;"- I think it comes from Massachusetts."
11:52;11:54;"- I think I want to say Quincy, Mass."
11:54;11:55;"- Quincy, Mass."
11:55;11:56;"- I could be wrong on that."
11:56;11:57;"- Every 30 episodes on TC,"
11:57;11:59;"we got to do a deep dive on Dunkin'."
11:59;12:00;"Who's down for--"
12:00;12:01;"- Quincy, Mass."
12:01;12:02;"- Nailed that."
12:02;12:03;"- Really?"
12:03;12:04;"- Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on."
12:04;12:05;"- Oh, year?"
12:05;12:06;"- I want to do your founding year."
12:06;12:07;"- What year do you think?"
12:07;12:08;"- Oh, man."
12:08;12:09;"- Ah, I don't have a sense of it."
12:09;12:10;"I can't remember."
12:10;12:14;"I'm just gonna guess wildly and say '72."
12:14;12:16;"- '55."
12:16;12:17;"- Closer."
12:17;12:18;"- Okay."
12:18;12:19;"- '50."
12:19;12:20;"- Wow, early."
12:20;12:22;"- Okay, that rings a bell now."
12:22;12:23;"- Wow."
12:23;12:24;"The first Dunkin' Donut,"
12:24;12:25;"and it was spelled the same way,"
12:25;12:27;"right there on Southern Artery in Quincy."
12:27;12:30;"- I think the Down for Dunkin' campaign"
12:30;12:32;"could be like the running gag"
12:32;12:34;"is that a bunch of people"
12:34;12:36;"are in all these various situations,"
12:36;12:38;"but they're always down for Dunkin'."
12:38;12:39;"- Right."
12:39;12:41;"- So they're hiking, they're at a funeral."
12:41;12:42;"Hey, you down for Dunkin'?"
12:42;12:43;"- Dunkin' traffic."
12:43;12:44;"- Right, yeah."
12:44;12:46;"- I think it's really important"
12:46;12:48;"for a brand that serves something"
12:48;12:50;"that's bad for you"
12:50;12:54;"to become that kind of hall pass brand."
12:54;12:55;"You know what I'm saying?"
12:55;12:56;"- Mm-hmm."
12:56;12:59;"- I think Down for Dunkin' could help"
12:59;13:00;"make people understand"
13:00;13:02;"that when you're near a Dunkin',"
13:02;13:04;"when you're at an event that has Dunkin',"
13:04;13:05;"when you are so blessed"
13:05;13:08;"that a friend is making a Dunkin' run,"
13:08;13:10;"your diet goes out the window."
13:10;13:12;"Your eating habits go out the window."
13:12;13:13;"This is a special."
13:13;13:14;"It's like I kind of--"
13:14;13:17;"- I know you're no carb, no gluten."
13:17;13:18;"It's out the window."
13:18;13:19;"- It's Dunkin'."
13:19;13:21;"- You're down for Dunkin'."
13:21;13:22;"- Yesterday was my cheat day."
13:22;13:23;"- It's Dunkin'."
13:23;13:25;"- That's me, that's the next one."
13:25;13:27;"It's Dunkin'."
13:27;13:29;"- That's the idiocracy version."
13:29;13:30;"- Yeah."
13:30;13:32;"- Welcome to Costco, I love you."
13:32;13:34;"It's Dunkin'."
13:34;13:35;"- It's just a--"
13:35;13:37;"- It's kind of Because I Can vibes."
13:37;13:39;"- Oh yeah, exactly."
13:39;13:40;"It's Because I Can."
13:40;13:43;"I was born in a free country,"
13:43;13:45;"the United States of America."
13:45;13:46;"My forefathers died,"
13:46;13:48;"so I could drink this Diet Coke."
13:48;13:50;"But yeah, with Dunkin', just,"
13:50;13:52;"""Hey man, didn't your doctor say"
13:52;13:53;"you shouldn't have any sugar?"""
13:53;13:55;"It's Dunkin'."
13:55;13:58;"- Weren't you in a coma for four months?"
13:58;13:59;"- Yeah."
13:59;14:01;"- It's Dunkin', dude."
14:01;14:04;"It's 4 a.m., I got the hot pepper ale."
14:04;14:05;"Got a lot of booze,"
14:05;14:06;"it's a whopper, it's a slumper,"
14:06;14:07;"third rail."
14:07;14:08;"Friday night and Friday,"
14:08;14:09;"I'm headed for the station."
14:09;14:12;"It's a train ride, don't be out of place."
14:12;14:13;"Dedicated to the boomers"
14:13;14:15;"in the back of the one train."
14:15;14:17;"They be kickin' out with those high,"
14:17;14:18;"I'm cocaine."
14:18;14:19;"It's just a turnstile,"
14:19;14:21;"I won't collapse, forget it."
14:21;14:22;"Ride between the cars,"
14:22;14:24;"busy smokin'."
14:24;14:25;"Head for the left,"
14:25;14:26;"hook off the rest and light blackout."
14:26;14:28;"The least we don't want homeboy,"
14:28;14:29;"put that crack out."
14:29;14:30;"You know you're light up"
14:30;14:32;"when the lights go down."
14:32;14:33;"You think you're breathin' New York Post,"
14:33;14:35;"folks speak downtown."
14:35;14:36;"Same faces every day,"
14:36;14:38;"but you don't know their name."
14:38;14:41;"Bloody people doin' places on a D train."
14:41;14:43;"On that train,"
14:43;14:45;"I wanna be on."
14:45;14:51;"(drums)"
14:51;14:53;"Checkin' trench coat,"
14:53;14:54;"going to work."
14:54;14:56;"And you be feelin' a train"
14:56;14:57;"like a Captain Kirk."
14:57;14:58;"Big pocket gangsters"
14:58;15:00;"payin' the desk."
15:00;15:01;"I'm caught a bullet in the lung"
15:01;15:03;"from burning gas."

15:04;15:06;"the baronet, the fool."
15:06;15:07;"Prostitutes and ex-corks"
15:07;15:08;"sliding for."
15:08;15:10;"Now you're stuck between the station"
15:10;15:11;"and it seems like an eternity."
15:11;15:12;"Sweatin' like soft drinks"
15:12;15:14;"in a fly-by fraternity."
15:14;15:15;"A $50 fine"
15:15;15:17;"for disturbing the peace."
15:17;15:18;"The neck, tortoise,"
15:18;15:19;"your leaves,"
15:19;15:20;"are crease."
15:20;15:21;"Hot cup of coffee"

15:36;15:38;"Sad of course for my man,"
15:38;15:39;"I'm reading LGREO."
15:39;15:40;"Riding the train down"
15:40;15:42;"from the El Barrio."
15:42;15:45;"From the station to Arnjulius."
15:45;15:46;"I brought a hot dog"
15:46;15:48;"from Georgia-Colonia."
15:48;15:49;"Okay, but this is funny."
15:49;15:50;"I'm looking at the tweet right now."
15:50;15:51;"Yeah."
15:51;15:52;"It's official."
15:52;15:53;"We're going by Duncan now."
15:53;15:55;"That little like smiley emoji"
15:55;15:57;"with the hands going hee hee."
15:57;15:58;"After 68 years of America"
15:58;16:00;"running on Duncan,"
16:00;16:02;"we're moving to a first name basis."
16:02;16:03;"Yellow heart."
16:03;16:04;"Okay."
16:04;16:08;"Excited to be #BFFStatus with you all."
16:08;16:10;"Some more emoji."
16:10;16:13;"#FirstNameBasis #Besties."
16:13;16:14;"I hate hashtags."
16:14;16:15;"Pushing it there."
16:15;16:17;"Who's clicking on the"
16:17;16:19;"first name basis hashtag"
16:19;16:20;"to find other tweets"
16:20;16:22;"that say first name basis?"
16:22;16:23;"I gotta collect those."
16:23;16:24;"Wait, how many retweets"
16:24;16:26;"do you think this has?"
16:26;16:29;"Oh, 22,000."
16:29;16:31;"Good guess now, but 4,800."
16:31;16:32;"I don't know if that means"
16:32;16:33;"it didn't kill it."
16:33;16:35;"It's got almost 15,000 likes though."
16:35;16:36;"You know what the first thing"
16:36;16:37;"that popped into my head was"
16:37;16:39;"when I heard about this?"
16:39;16:40;"What's that?"
16:40;16:41;"This is fake bravery."
16:41;16:43;"This is stolen valor."
16:43;16:45;"This is like IHOP, dude."
16:45;16:46;"Basically what I was thinking is,"
16:46;16:47;"you know what?"
16:47;16:49;"Swinging big and changing your name"
16:49;16:50;"is a big deal."
16:50;16:51;"Dropping the donuts."
16:51;16:53;"Everybody knows you for your donuts."
16:53;16:55;"I guess you want to not be"
16:55;16:57;"fully associated with donuts."
16:57;16:58;"Maybe they think the next generation"
16:58;17:00;"will be more likely to go get a coffee"
17:00;17:01;"or a sandwich there"
17:01;17:03;"if they aren't thinking about the donuts."
17:03;17:04;"Breakfast sandwich."
17:05;17:07;"But then the first thing I thought was,"
17:07;17:09;"okay, if you really got some [bleep]"
17:09;17:10;"then you should let somebody else"
17:10;17:12;"call their [bleep] Dunkin' Donuts."
17:12;17:14;"Let me open a Dunkin' Donuts."
17:14;17:15;"Okay, you want to be Dunkin', I get it."
17:15;17:18;"You're throwing your whole heritage away."
17:18;17:20;"But why can't we still have Dunkin' Donuts?"
17:20;17:21;"You know what I mean?"
17:21;17:22;"Wow."
17:22;17:23;"That's heavy, dude."
17:23;17:25;"I was just like, this is fake bravery."
17:25;17:26;"If you--"
17:26;17:27;"Fake--"
17:27;17:28;"Stolen valor."
17:28;17:29;"This is stolen valor."
17:29;17:30;"You know what I mean?"
17:30;17:32;"Put your money where your mouth is."
17:32;17:34;"Okay, you're done with Dunkin' Donuts?"
17:34;17:35;"Okay."
17:35;17:36;"But they're saying they're"
17:36;17:37;"on the same basis."
17:37;17:39;"They're not saying they're done."
17:39;17:41;"I mean, it'd be like if you changed your name"
17:41;17:43;"to Vampire,"
17:43;17:45;"which is how I refer to your band."
17:45;17:47;"And then somebody else just"
17:47;17:49;"took over with Vampire Weekend?"
17:49;17:50;"I don't know."
17:50;17:51;"I think people should loosen up"
17:51;17:52;"about copyright, you know?"
17:52;17:54;"I feel you on that."
17:54;17:55;"What is this DNKN?"
17:55;17:56;"They've also truncated--"
17:56;17:57;"Yeah, that's like a mess."
17:57;17:59;"Yeah, I think we--"
17:59;18:01;"It feels like that's the next logical jump."
18:01;18:03;"It seems like they did two, two in one."
18:03;18:05;"Somebody asked them,"
18:05;18:07;"""Will the logo just be 1D?"""
18:07;18:09;"They wrote back, ""Nope, the DD is still alive."""
18:09;18:11;"I guess at least IHOP"
18:11;18:13;"was kind of an"
18:13;18:15;"epic troll."
18:15;18:16;"This is just weird."
18:16;18:18;"I don't know how I feel about this."
18:18;18:19;"Not gonna age well."
18:19;18:20;"Dunkin'."
18:20;18:22;"People are already calling them Dunkin' too, right?"
18:22;18:24;"This isn't a radical change."
18:24;18:26;"Burger King became BK."
18:26;18:28;"McDonald's became Mickey D's."
18:28;18:29;"You know what this is?"
18:29;18:30;"This is similar to that thing I was saying"
18:30;18:32;"about the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
18:32;18:34;"This is fan service."
18:34;18:36;"They're just sucking up to the fans."
18:36;18:38;"""Hey guys, we know you mostly call it Dunkin'."
18:38;18:40;"Now we call it Dunkin' too."
18:40;18:41;"We're just like you, man."""
18:41;18:43;"The fans are like, ""Uh-huh."""
18:43;18:44;"Yeah."
18:44;18:45;"Cool."
18:45;18:46;"It's that same thing."
18:46;18:48;"I'm just like, ""Hey guys,"
18:48;18:50;"I know you always wanted to see Iron Man and Spider-Man"
18:50;18:51;"have a joke together."
18:51;18:52;"Here you go."""
18:52;18:54;"Do you think employees answered the phone,"
18:54;18:56;"""Thank you for calling Dunkin'""?"
18:56;18:57;"Now they probably do."
18:57;18:59;"""Thank you for calling Dunkin' on Pal Avenue."""
18:59;19:01;"I should point out that one of the first replies"
19:01;19:03;"to Dunkin' Donuts was from DiGiorno."
19:03;19:05;"Where they just waved at them,"
19:05;19:06;"and then Dunkin' wrote back, ""Hiya."""
19:06;19:09;"And then DiGiorno said, ""You can call us DiGiorno."""
19:09;19:11;"And then Dunkin' wrote, ""Then call us Dunkin'-o."""
19:11;19:14;"And then DiGiorno wrote, ""Deal. Heart."""
19:14;19:15;"This is disgusting."
19:15;19:17;"Can I ask you, what do you dislike more"
19:17;19:21;"when there's animosity between the two brands"
19:21;19:22;"or when they kind of are getting along"
19:22;19:23;"and promoting each other?"
19:23;19:24;"That's a great question."
19:24;19:27;"I like more when there's animosity between the brands"
19:27;19:29;"because let's keep it real here."
19:29;19:30;"Dog eat dog."
19:30;19:32;"This is a dog eat dog world."
19:32;19:35;"And just don't lie to us."
19:35;19:36;"I think it's far more wicked"
19:36;19:40;"when a brand pretends to be a chill person."
19:40;19:42;"So Dunkin' and DiGiorno..."
19:42;19:45;"Not competitors, per se."
19:45;19:47;"You know, it would be, like, fun to kind of get in there"
19:47;19:50;"and just be, like, treat both of them."
19:50;19:51;"Love you, DiGiorno."
19:51;19:54;"I would far rather stay at home"
19:54;19:55;"and make one of your pizzas"
19:55;19:56;"than ever eat any of the bullsh--"
19:56;19:58;"they serve at Dunkin' Donuts."
19:58;20:00;"Signed, Frank Castle."
20:00;20:01;"Yeah."
20:01;20:02;"Anyway."
20:02;20:04;"This is some post-IHOP corporate camber."
20:04;20:08;"I know, I just thought that Dunkin' Donuts was cooler."
20:08;20:09;"Oh, man."
20:09;20:12;"Then they got this whole weird, like, promotion with Oreo and..."
20:12;20:13;"Go to hell."
20:13;20:15;"[laughs]"
20:15;20:16;"Go to hell."
20:16;20:17;"Man."
20:17;20:20;"Last episode, I told Steve Miller to go to hell."
20:20;20:21;"Yeah."
20:21;20:23;"This episode, Dunkin' Donuts."
20:23;20:26;"♪ Don't lie to me ♪"
20:26;20:30;"♪ Don't lie to me ♪"

20:41;20:43;"♪ Don't lie to me ♪"
20:43;20:45;"Time crisis."
20:45;20:48;"This all leads us to probably the most time-crisisy thing"
20:48;20:50;"that has happened recently."
20:50;20:52;"We were getting all sorts of tweets about this,"
20:52;20:54;"e-mails, things of that nature."
20:54;20:57;"This was in the episode that we created the concept of"
20:57;20:59;"Frank Castle and Punisher Burgers."
20:59;21:03;"Before that, we kind of made a prediction, as I recall,"
21:03;21:05;"and we were just talking about how all these brands"
21:05;21:08;"were kind of, like, one-upping each other with their social media presences"
21:08;21:12;"to say, like, who's funnier or who has more savage clapbacks or something."
21:12;21:16;"And I believe we more or less said, there will come a day"
21:16;21:20;"where a brand straight-facedly tries to tell other people,"
21:20;21:23;"""You know what, guys? All these other brands are full of s--t,"
21:23;21:24;"but I'm a straight shooter."""
21:24;21:27;"That's kind of how we started the Punisher Burgers thing."
21:27;21:29;"Although we took it to its logical extreme, which would be"
21:29;21:32;"an actual person asserting their personhood."
21:32;21:34;"That's why Punisher Burgers always had Frank Castle."
21:34;21:36;"I'm just one man."
21:36;21:39;"So finally, a brand actually decided--"
21:39;21:40;"Stepped up."
21:40;21:43;"--to step up and say, ""You know what? Let's cut the crap."""
21:43;21:45;"And that brand was Steakums."
21:45;21:48;"Steakum is just like a kind of nasty, really cheap steak."
21:48;21:50;"Is it on a sandwich or--"
21:50;21:54;"It's a frozen steak that you buy in the frozen food aisle."
21:54;21:55;"Thinly sliced."
21:55;21:58;"That you, like, microwave or, like, heat up in a pan."
21:58;22:00;"I remember eating it. It's rough stuff."
22:00;22:01;"It was invented in--"
22:01;22:03;"It's frozen meat."
22:03;22:05;"It was-- Yo, this is sick."
22:05;22:08;"Steakums was invented in 1968 by food technologist--"
22:08;22:09;"Oh, dude, '68."
22:09;22:11;"--Eugene Gagliardi."
22:11;22:12;"Oh."
22:12;22:14;"Who is also credited with inventing popcorn chicken."
22:14;22:15;"That's sick."
22:15;22:17;"Okay, he's kind of a hero."
22:17;22:19;"I like popcorn chicken."
22:19;22:23;"It actually officially started in 1975 out of Westchester, PA,"
22:23;22:26;"and then went to-- Heinz brand bought it, and then--"
22:26;22:28;"Marketed under its Ore-Ida frozen foods brand."
22:28;22:29;"I like that."
22:29;22:30;"Oh, yeah, Ore-Ida."
22:30;22:31;"They make some good [bleep]"
22:31;22:36;"Long story short, it ended up with Quaker-made meat in 2006."
22:36;22:37;"I love corporate histories."
22:37;22:41;"'94, it was acquired by Tri Foods International."
22:41;22:43;"And then Gagliardi sued Tri Foods in 1996"
22:43;22:46;"after he was fired and removed as chairman of the board."
22:46;22:47;"Can you imagine the heat on that?"
22:47;22:50;"The inventor of Steakums pleading with the board,"
22:50;22:54;"""You can't do this to me. I invented Steakums."""
22:54;22:56;"""We don't need you anymore, Gagliardi."""
22:56;22:59;"It's just like Elon Musk trying to get him to leave Tesla."
22:59;23:02;"Mid-'90s Steakum just--"
23:02;23:04;"Scene was hot."
23:04;23:06;"That's amazing."
23:06;23:08;"Just at home talking to his family,"
23:08;23:10;"they're trying to push me out."
23:10;23:12;"""I [bleep] invented Steakums."""
23:12;23:15;"Isn't it just like frozen sliced beef?"
23:15;23:17;"What did you invent exactly?"
23:17;23:20;"Dad, I mean, I'll give you props for popcorn chicken,"
23:20;23:23;"but Steakums just seems like a real step down."
23:23;23:27;"It's just thinly sliced roast beef."
23:27;23:29;"There was a lawsuit in 2012,"
23:29;23:33;"and the judge describes the product as, quote,"
23:33;23:36;"""Chopped and formed emulsified meat product"
23:36;23:38;"""comprised of beef trimmings"
23:38;23:40;"""left over after an animal is slaughtered"
23:40;23:43;"""and all the primary cuts, such as tenderloin,"
23:43;23:45;"""filet, and rib eye, are removed."
23:45;23:48;"""The emulsified meat is then pressed into a loaf"
23:48;23:51;"""and sliced, frozen, and packaged."""
23:51;23:53;"And then actually I went down the rabbit hole a little bit"
23:53;23:55;"on Quaker-made meats."
23:55;23:57;"It's like a hot dog, essentially."
23:57;23:59;"Yeah, it's kind of like a meatloaf hot dog."
23:59;24:00;"The leftovers."
24:00;24:01;"Yeah."
24:01;24:03;"So I don't know-- do you know Glassdoor?"
24:03;24:05;"It's sort of the company review site."
24:05;24:06;"No."
24:06;24:09;"So employees of any company can go on Glassdoor.com"
24:09;24:12;"and review where they work or have recently worked."
24:12;24:16;"So the Glassdoor review for Quaker-made meats"
24:16;24:18;"has only one entry, and part of the entry,"
24:18;24:20;"it's the lowest possible review,"
24:20;24:23;"and the person says, ""The product is disgusting."
24:23;24:26;"""Talk about the lowest quality, quote, unquote, 'meat'"
24:26;24:27;"""you can imagine."
24:27;24:28;"""Roadkill is better."
24:28;24:30;"""All the meat comes from overseas"
24:30;24:34;"""and comes in moldy and almost 75% fat."""
24:34;24:37;"Ooh, rough stuff, folks."
24:37;24:38;"Rough stuff, folks."
24:38;24:40;"That's gnarly."
24:40;24:42;"Yeah, it really seems nasty."
24:42;24:45;"So I guess Steakums-- so that's the current owner,"
24:45;24:47;"Quaker-made meats, so just so everybody knows the backstory."
24:47;24:49;"That's the product we're dealing with."
24:49;24:54;"Steakums is an orphan brand violently ripped from its creator."
24:54;24:56;"Steakums is like a Frankenstein"
24:56;24:58;"ripped away from its noble creator,"
24:58;25:01;"and now this Frankenstein is taken to the streets,"
25:01;25:04;"is coming after the villagers with their pitchforks."

26:10;26:12;"In 2017, Steakums started a campaign"
26:12;26:14;"to have their Twitter account verified"
26:14;26:16;"with the hashtag #VerifiedSteakum,"

26:22;26:24;"Oh, so they've been at this for a while."
26:24;26:26;"They are the original Punisher burgers."
26:26;26:27;"It's true."
26:27;26:29;"Philadelphia agency Alibac Communications"
26:29;26:31;"verified the Steakums Twitter account."
26:31;26:33;"Alibac account director Jesse Bender"
26:33;26:35;"told Adweek that the agency was given the green light"
26:35;26:37;"in August 2017 to start managing"
26:37;26:38;"the Steakums Twitter account."
26:38;26:40;"The goal was to begin a dialogue with consumers"
26:40;26:41;"and create a community."
26:41;26:43;"So this is all the backstory on Steakums."
26:43;26:45;"And then Steakums went a little viral."
26:45;26:48;"They wrote a tweet thread that started with this."
26:48;26:50;"It was on the Steakum verified Twitter account."

27:46;27:47;"'you don't know how good you have it.'"
27:47;27:49;"And they don't have mentors to talk to"
27:49;27:51;"because most of them have no concept"
27:51;27:52;"for growing up in this strange time"
27:52;27:55;"which perpetuates the feelings of helplessness, loneliness."
27:55;27:57;"They have full access to social media"
27:57;27:58;"and the information highway,"
27:58;28:00;"but they feel more alone and insecure than ever."
28:00;28:02;"Being behind a screen 24/7"
28:02;28:03;"has made them numb to everything,"
28:03;28:05;"anxious and depressed about everything,"
28:05;28:06;"and vitriolic or closed off"
28:06;28:08;"toward anyone different from them."
28:08;28:10;"Young people today have it the best and the worst."
28:10;28:11;"There's so much to process"
28:11;28:13;"and very few trusted accessible outlets"
28:13;28:14;"to process it all through."
28:14;28:16;"So they go to memes."
28:16;28:18;"They go to obscure or absurdist humor."
28:18;28:20;"They go to frozen meat companies on Twitter."
28:20;28:21;"And rant."
28:21;28:23;"Stake 'em, bless."
28:23;28:27;"Are they going to frozen meat companies on Twitter?"
28:27;28:29;"I know. I love how it's like..."
28:29;28:31;"Are young people flocking to brands"
28:31;28:34;"on social media for love, guidance, and attention?"
28:34;28:35;"Yeah, I know."
28:35;28:36;"The thing that I don't like about the Stake 'Em's thing,"
28:36;28:39;"I mean, you know, shout out to whatever, whoever,"
28:39;28:43;"this, this, shout out to whatever/whoever."
28:43;28:45;"You know, there's somebody having some fun."
28:45;28:46;"I mean, this is probably the type of shit"
28:46;28:48;"that I would write if I was just some,"
28:48;28:50;"got a job at a Philadelphia-based advertising agency"
28:50;28:51;"and they're just like,"
28:51;28:53;"""Stake 'Em's doesn't give a f***."
28:53;28:55;"Just see if you can get people talking about Stake 'Em's."""
28:55;28:56;"Right."
28:56;28:57;"Think outside the box here."
28:57;28:59;"We're selling the bottom of the barrel here,"
28:59;29:02;"like the dregs in the frozen food aisle."
29:02;29:03;"Right."
29:03;29:05;"We could just say, like, anything."
29:05;29:06;"You know what?"
29:06;29:08;"There's something Trump-ian about this."
29:08;29:09;"Oh, for sure."
29:09;29:12;"And I know that probably, I bet whoever wrote this"
29:12;29:13;"is not pro-Trump,"
29:13;29:15;"working at a Philadelphia-based advertising agency,"
29:15;29:16;"I'm guessing."
29:16;29:18;"But there is also something about, like,"
29:18;29:22;"just the task of trying to turn Stake 'Em's"
29:22;29:23;"into something noble."
29:23;29:25;"There's something very Republican about it, actually,"
29:25;29:27;"'cause it's that vibe of just, like,"
29:27;29:29;"kind of, like, actively participating"
29:29;29:31;"in really f***ed up systems"
29:31;29:32;"and then trying to, like,"
29:32;29:36;"talk about, like, the nobility of the suffering that you cause."
29:36;29:38;"There's a lot of fundamental premises"
29:38;29:39;"that I'm not buying with Stake 'Em's."
29:39;29:42;"Yeah, and number one, I think you pointed that out, Jake,"
29:42;29:43;"this whole rant starts out,"
29:43;29:45;"""Why are so many young people flocking to brands"
29:45;29:47;"on social media for love, guidance, and attention?"""
29:47;29:48;"They're not."
29:48;29:49;"Are they?"
29:49;29:50;"Are they."
29:50;29:51;"The correct way to phrase it would be, like,"
29:51;29:53;"""Why are young people amused"
29:53;29:56;"when brands target them"
29:56;29:59;"in the space where they spend most of their time?"""
29:59;30:01;"Young people are not flocking to brands."
30:01;30:03;"And also, the idea that this is, like,"
30:03;30:04;"a specific generational thing,"
30:04;30:06;"that's, like, similar to being, like,"
30:06;30:08;"""Why do frat boys in the '90s"
30:08;30:10;"flock to Budweiser commercials?"
30:10;30:12;"It's because they're lonely, isolated."
30:12;30:13;"They feel powerless."
30:13;30:16;"So instead, they find power in laughing about a frog."""
30:16;30:17;"Yeah."
30:17;30:20;"You're actively participating in making the world gnarlier"
30:20;30:22;"by, like, invading people's space this way."
30:22;30:24;"Young people are not flocking to brands."
30:24;30:28;"Brands are doing attention-getting stunts."
30:28;30:31;"Anyway, I guess in 2014,"
30:31;30:33;"Stake 'Em tweeted an Ayn--"
30:33;30:34;"Sorry, it's Ayn Rand quote,"

30:39;30:40;"Huh."
30:40;30:42;"Oh, okay."
30:42;30:43;"I mean, on the face of it,"
30:43;30:45;"I mean, I guess that applies to some creative people."
30:45;30:48;"Kind of ahead of the game, to be honest."
30:48;30:49;"Right, but--"
30:49;30:50;"It's, like, 2014?"
30:50;30:51;"Ayn Rand is beloved by--"
30:51;30:52;"Paul Ryan."
30:52;30:54;"By, yeah, libertarians and right-wingers."
30:54;30:55;"But why is Stake 'Em--"
30:55;30:56;"But she wrote fiction."
30:56;30:58;"Four years ago, tweeting--"
30:58;30:59;"Yeah."
30:59;31:01;"We got to get to Stake 'Em people on the phone."
31:01;31:03;"Well, the sad part is--"
31:03;31:04;"There's people that run this account."

31:13;31:15;"Whoever is running the Stake 'Em's account"
31:15;31:16;"is clearly just--"
31:16;31:18;"They're just going full-on rogue."
31:18;31:21;"It's literally just, like, how many eyeballs can we get?"
31:21;31:22;"Well, this is, like, the whole thing,"

31:29;31:30;"I doubt it."

31:40;31:41;"I don't know, man."
31:41;31:42;"Let's listen to some music."
31:42;31:44;"Let's listen to some music, man."
31:44;31:45;"What's a palate cleanser?"
31:45;31:46;"Twiddle."
31:46;31:48;"We could go down that route."
31:48;31:49;"Let's throw on some Twiddle."
31:49;31:51;"Twiddle, this song is called ""Jam Flow Man."""
31:51;31:54;"[laughter]"
31:55;31:57;"Have you heard of the Jam Flow Man?"
31:57;31:59;"Jam sickest and the quickest hands in the lane."
31:59;32:01;"Got that shit down real nice."
32:01;32:03;"He'll play his jam and it won't be twice."
32:03;32:05;"No, the Jam Flow Man don't give a damn."
32:05;32:07;"Playing shows across the lane."
32:07;32:09;"Rocking out with his band."
32:09;32:11;"Playing a fat old reggae jam."
32:11;32:13;"The Jam Flow Man, won't you make that sound?"
32:13;32:16;"Make my body move all around."
32:16;32:18;"Twist it up and blaze it down."
32:18;32:20;"Pass it back and forth, spin it round and round."
32:20;32:22;"The Jam Flow Man, won't you make that sound?"
32:22;32:25;"Make my body move all around."
32:25;32:27;"Twist it up and blaze it down."
32:27;32:29;"Pass it back and forth, spin it round and round."
32:29;32:31;"The Jam Flow Man, he started young,"
32:31;32:33;"writing songs with the catchiest drum."
32:33;32:35;"First the blues, then with jazz."
32:35;32:37;"The Jam Flow Man blew up real fast."
32:37;32:39;"Now, the Jam Flow Man at the age of 10"
32:39;32:41;"was better at the guitar than most men."
32:41;32:43;"He was real good now and he was real good then."
32:43;32:46;"Playing in the clubs and making up more chains."
32:46;32:50;"That was a little taste of the band Twiddle with Jam Flow Man."
32:50;32:54;"That's a song we've always been meaning to play on Time Crisis and talk about."
32:54;32:56;"But you know what? Today's still not the day."
32:56;32:58;"We just gave you a little taste."
32:58;33:01;"Jam Flow Man by Twiddle, eventually we will talk about."
33:01;33:04;"But in the meantime, all TC heads should go check out this song,"
33:04;33:07;"Jam Flow Man by Twiddle, which is a very controversial song"
33:07;33:09;"within the jam band community. Correct?"
33:09;33:14;"Fair to say. Eventually we will do an entire episode on Jam Flow Man."
33:14;33:18;"Anyway, you know, on the last episode, we didn't really get anywhere with it,"
33:18;33:22;"but we found out some pretty disturbing news about Steve Miller,"
33:22;33:27;"which is that he toured with the Grateful Dead in the early 90s."
33:27;33:30;"Even performed with them. Not just opened for them, performed with them."
33:30;33:32;"Was it a full tour?"
33:32;33:33;"I think it was a whole summer tour."
33:33;33:34;"Wow."
33:34;33:37;"I saw on Instagram somebody was selling a t-shirt from that run."
33:37;33:39;"Somebody tagged us in it."
33:39;33:41;"And there was a t-shirt from that run that was like,"
33:41;33:43;"you know, summer tour '92 or whatever."
33:43;33:44;"'92, yeah."
33:44;33:47;"And then we found out that after Jerry passed,"
33:47;33:49;"Steve Miller did multiple interviews where he talked about"
33:49;33:50;"how much he disliked the Grateful Dead."
33:50;33:52;"Just threw him under the bus."
33:52;33:53;"Threw him under the bus."
33:53;33:56;"He waited until Jerry died to talk that s***."
33:56;33:57;"Said they were boring, whatever."
33:57;33:59;"Class act, Steve."
33:59;34:01;"[laughs]"
34:01;34:04;"And Jake was so fired up, he said, ""Go to hell."""
34:04;34:05;"Yeah."
34:05;34:07;"We gotten anywhere with getting in touch with Steve Miller"
34:07;34:08;"to tell his side of the story?"
34:08;34:11;"I reached out to the band on Twitter and nothing,"
34:11;34:15;"and I did also reach out to the band's publicist"
34:15;34:18;"and followed up, wrote a very nice email,"
34:18;34:20;"very cordial, and nothing."
34:20;34:22;"Radio silence from the Miller camp."
34:22;34:24;"There's two sides to every story."
34:24;34:25;"Maybe Steve will come back and say,"
34:25;34:26;"""I did open for the Grateful Dead."
34:26;34:29;"I did perform with them, and I wanted to like them."
34:29;34:32;"But honestly, behind the scenes, Jerry was a d*** to me."""
34:32;34:34;"Phil was very difficult."
34:34;34:35;"Phil was very rude to me."
34:35;34:38;"I heard him laughing about my song ""The Joker,"""
34:38;34:39;"which I think is a great song,"
34:39;34:42;"and Phil was just laughing as if my songs had no depth."
34:42;34:44;"And yeah, did I harbor a grudge?"
34:44;34:45;"You're goddamn right I did."
34:45;34:49;"And after Jerry died, did I feel free to finally speak my mind"
34:49;34:50;"and get a few licks in?"
34:50;34:51;"Yeah, I did."
34:51;34:52;"Okay, I would understand that."

35:41;35:44;"I was very disappointed to hear about this."
35:44;35:47;"As you know, on the last episode,"
35:47;35:49;"I talked about this Jim Morrison interview that I love"
35:49;35:53;"where he responds to an interviewer fat-shaming him."
35:53;35:54;"He's way ahead of his time."
35:54;35:56;"People didn't even use the word ""fat-shaming"" back then."
35:56;36:01;"And Jim Morrison pauses, and he makes a case for why it's fine to be fat."
36:01;36:03;"And then we start talking about it."
36:03;36:04;"You know what, Jim Morrison?"
36:04;36:07;"He's kind of out of fashion these days, but he's pretty cool, actually."
36:07;36:09;"You know what? I f*** with the Doors. The Doors are cool."
36:09;36:11;"Because I've been saying for years that the Doors are not cool."
36:11;36:15;"But now I'm shifting gears, and I'm saying the Doors are cool, man."
36:15;36:18;"They haven't been cool for about 15, 20 years."
36:18;36:21;"It's dope that you're so flexible to change your opinions."
36:21;36:26;"People age, they get solidified, calcified in their views."
36:26;36:27;"Look at you."
36:27;36:28;"No, the Doors are cool."
36:28;36:29;"And then you know what? Right after--"
36:29;36:31;"I'm back in with the Doors."
36:31;36:32;"Almost right after we talked about that,"
36:32;36:36;"I wanted to go see Jay-Z and Beyoncé at the Rose Bowl."
36:36;36:38;"Oh, yeah. You sent me some image."
36:38;36:41;"I sent you an image because, you know, Jay-Z and Beyoncé,"
36:41;36:43;"it doesn't get more cutting edge than that."
36:43;36:44;"True that."
36:44;36:48;"Every time I've seen either one of them live,"
36:48;36:51;"I've always been kind of awestruck by the show."
36:51;36:52;"And I'm not somebody who gets--"
36:52;36:54;"I don't get that excited about going to concerts."
36:54;36:57;"Even this concert, I'll be honest, I was kind of like--"
36:57;36:59;"I feel like I saw Beyoncé at Coachella yesterday."
36:59;37:00;"Uh-huh."
37:00;37:02;"And then I get there, within five minutes,"
37:02;37:04;"I'm like, ""I'm so glad I'm here."""
37:04;37:05;"They always do something a little different."
37:05;37:07;"They have so many incredible visuals."
37:07;37:09;"You're in the Rose Bowl, but it felt almost intimate"
37:09;37:12;"because they have this giant, giant screen,"
37:12;37:15;"one of the biggest screens that I've ever seen,"
37:15;37:18;"and a lot of really interesting imagery,"
37:18;37:19;"a lot of it pre-shot."
37:19;37:22;"So anyway, there's some song that they're performing,"
37:22;37:27;"and the kind of motif for the visuals was famous mug shots."
37:27;37:28;"Mm-hmm."
37:28;37:31;"And who's one of the first ones that they put on this screen?"
37:31;37:34;"Probably 100 feet tall for all the Rose Bowl to see."
37:34;37:35;"Jim Morrison."
37:36;37:39;"And then I'm like, ""Holy sh*t, Jay-Z and Beyoncé"
37:39;37:40;"are basically telling to the world,"
37:40;37:43;"'We know the Doors have not been particularly cool"
37:43;37:46;"in the classic rock community for the past 15, 20 years."
37:46;37:48;"We know that right now Grateful Dead are very hot,"
37:48;37:50;"and nobody's really talking about the Doors anymore,"
37:50;37:54;"but here Jay-Z and f*cking Beyoncé are saying"
37:54;37:56;"Jim Morrison is relevant again.'"""
37:56;37:59;"And I was like, ""Okay, Jim Morrison got a shout-out"
37:59;38:01;"on Time Crisis. That's one."
38:01;38:05;"Now his mug shot is plastered 100 feet high"
38:05;38:07;"at the Rose Bowl with Jay-Z and Beyoncé."
38:07;38:10;"That's two. When am I going to see three?"""
38:10;38:12;"Well, guess what? I didn't have to wait very long."
38:12;38:15;"The last time I saw Jay-Z and Beyoncé perform together,"
38:15;38:17;"this is On the Run 2 tour."
38:17;38:19;"I saw On the Run 1 tour."
38:19;38:23;"And in that concert, they both have so many great hits,"
38:23;38:25;"but that was this moment where kind of"
38:25;38:28;"Beyoncé was ascending at light speed,"
38:28;38:30;"and Jay-Z was kind of settling into his, like,"
38:30;38:31;"elder statesman status."
38:31;38:34;"So I remember a lot of people saying about that show,"
38:34;38:36;"""I mean, it was all about Beyoncé."""
38:36;38:37;"And, you know, I'm a big Jay-Z fan,"
38:37;38:38;"so I was kind of like, ""Come on, you know,"
38:38;38:39;"it's about both of them."""
38:39;38:40;"But people were like, ""I don't know, just Beyoncé."""
38:40;38:42;"It was so exciting seeing Beyoncé then."
38:42;38:45;"Whereas at this show, I really felt like it was 50/50."
38:45;38:46;"You know, Beyoncé did her thing,"
38:46;38:48;"but hearing Jay-Z dip back into the hits,"
38:48;38:50;"that was pretty cool, man."
38:50;38:52;"And so anyway, here I am thinking,"
38:52;38:54;"deep in my thoughts about,"
38:54;38:57;"""Am I going to see a third Jim Morrison reference"
38:57;38:59;"to really let me know that the doors are back?"""
38:59;39:02;"And then Jay-Z busts into this song,"
39:02;39:04;"which I hadn't heard or thought about in a long time."
39:04;39:06;"Remember this one, Jake?"
39:06;39:07;"- Come on!"

47:35;47:37;"- I bet Tom York was not vegan in '93."
47:37;47:40;"I bet he was crushing burgers."
47:40;47:41;"- Okay, well, hold on."
47:41;47:42;"Let's get a little more context,"
47:42;47:45;"because maybe Tom was doing some performance art."
47:45;47:48;"In a 1993 interview with Melody Maker, he said of the track,"
47:48;47:51;"""It's really just a series of thoughts about getting up on stage,"
47:51;47:53;"making a brat of yourself and making a career out of it."
47:53;47:55;"I'm sure it was great to be Jim Morrison in 1968,"
47:55;47:58;"but a lot of people can't relinquish these obsessions."""
47:58;47:59;"Okay, that's not so bad."
47:59;48:00;"- Yeah."
48:00;48:02;"- At least in that interview, he's kind of just, like,"
48:02;48:07;"poking holes at the idea of Jim Morrison as, like, an idol."
48:07;48:10;"I could understand that he's a young rock singer coming out and being like,"
48:10;48:12;"""You know, you've got to kill your idols a little bit."""
48:12;48:16;"Maybe he's saying Jim Morrison has been elevated to a godlike status, whatever."
48:16;48:18;"I don't know. That seems fair."
48:18;48:19;"But hold on."
48:19;48:23;"A year before, he did another interview where he was talking about it,"
48:23;48:25;"and this is what he said."
48:25;48:26;"- '92 is early."
48:26;48:32;"- ""Jim Morrison's a fat, talentless bastard, and he's dead."
48:32;48:34;"And none of that means anything."""
48:34;48:37;"What's the obsession with Jim Morrison being fat?"
48:37;48:39;"I got to say, there's something weird."
48:39;48:41;"This is a true time crisis."
48:41;48:44;"We're dipping in 1969, 1992, 2018."
48:44;48:48;"There is something really sad to me to think about."
48:48;48:49;"And I understand Jim Morrison."
48:49;48:51;"I had an impression of him, too,"
48:51;48:55;"that he was kind of, like, pretentious, full of himself."
48:55;48:57;"And I got to say, when we heard that interview,"
48:57;48:59;"that really changed things for me."
48:59;49:03;"So it's really sad to think that 1969, Jim Morrison was being this thoughtful guy,"
49:03;49:07;"and then 23 years later, Tom York had to come out of the gate with Radiohead"
49:07;49:09;"saying that he's a fat, talentless bastard and he's dead."
49:09;49:11;"So anyway, here's the whole quote."
49:11;49:14;"""Jim Morrison's a fat, talentless bastard and he's dead."
49:14;49:15;"And none of that means anything."
49:15;49:17;"It's more important just to have your own voice within the business"
49:17;49:20;"than to live up to this thing that you're supposed to live up to."
49:20;49:22;"I'm reading this book by Lester Bangs at the moment,"
49:22;49:24;"and there's this brilliant thing about how, on the one hand,"
49:24;49:26;"rock and roll should be taken very seriously."
49:26;49:29;"On the other hand, it should be completely taking the piss out of itself."
49:29;49:32;"Like the Stooges, on the one hand, they're a real f*cked up band."
49:32;49:34;"But on the other hand, they just take the piss."
49:34;49:36;"Iggy Pop is totally taking the piss so badly."""
49:36;49:39;"That's one of those things--I feel like we talk about this on Time Crisis a lot."
49:39;49:42;"There's always the little biases and the narcissism,"
49:42;49:45;"small difference at any kind of cultural moment."
49:45;49:49;"I was kind of raised in not a totally dissimilar time from early '90s"
49:49;49:52;"where I was reading rock magazines and stuff."
49:52;49:56;"Of course, that probably made me cool on Jim Morrison a little bit"
49:56;49:59;"because I understood that from the rock critic point of view,"
49:59;50:01;"Iggy Pop, who I also like and admire--"
50:01;50:03;"and I like the Stooges and I like his solo stuff--"
50:03;50:11;"Iggy Pop is punk rock, funnier, more zany, seemingly more self-aware,"
50:11;50:13;"whereas Jim Morrison would be whatever."
50:13;50:16;"I also got to say, at some point, when you're just kind of repeating"
50:16;50:20;"the received wisdom of the critics, you got to at least take a step back"
50:20;50:23;"and say, ""I don't have an original thought."""
50:23;50:27;"I would say, yeah, as a rebuttal to Tom here back in '92--"
50:27;50:32;"we can't go too hard on Tom here because this was probably when he was 20 or whatever."
50:32;50:35;"How old was Tom York in '92?"
50:35;50:39;"The Doors have more memorable songs than the Stooges or Iggy Pop."
50:39;50:41;"I'm just going to throw that out there."
50:41;50:44;"I'm going to say this--the Doors were a much more original band"
50:44;50:46;"than the Stooges and Iggy Pop."
50:46;50:49;"In '92, Tom was 24."
50:49;50:55;"Also, you know Iggy loved Jim Morrison, at least in the early days."
50:55;50:57;"They're both out there shirtless, wearing leather pants."

51:03;51:04;"Get out of here."

51:05;51:09;"And also I got to say, I like the Stooges, but if you had no context for it"
51:09;51:12;"and you were like, ""There's a band from the '60s,"""

51:56;51:58;"You know who produced that Jay-Z song?"
51:58;51:59;"Was it Kanye?"
51:59;52:00;"It was Kanye."
52:00;52:01;"Oh!"
52:01;52:02;"Also, fun fact about that song--"
52:02;52:03;"Dude, that's amazing."
52:03;52:04;"Whole circle, man."
52:04;52:08;"Do you remember that song Nickelback did on a Spider-Man soundtrack"
52:08;52:09;"and it was like Chad Kroger--"
52:09;52:10;"Oh, with Josie from Saliva."
52:10;52:11;"I knew that."
52:11;52:12;"That's him doing those--"
52:12;52:14;"I do not know that song, Hot Lips."
52:14;52:16;"Remember there was a band called Saliva?"
52:16;52:17;"No."
52:17;52:20;"♪ I think that a hero could save me ♪"
52:20;52:22;"There was a band called Saliva?"
52:22;52:24;"Yeah, and the singer was a guy named Josie."
52:24;52:26;"I've never heard of that band."
52:26;52:29;"They were kind of part of that, like, post-rap rock wave."
52:29;52:33;"Anyway, they didn't want to actually sample the Doors,"
52:33;52:35;"so they recreated the sample."
52:35;52:37;"So it's not on the Jay-Z song, it's not Jim Morrison."
52:37;52:40;"It's the guy from Saliva going, ""Yeah, oh, yeah."""
52:40;52:42;"""Come on!"""
52:42;52:44;"You're getting a pretty good Morrison impression."
52:44;52:45;"No, he killed it."
52:45;52:47;"I always felt like people were hard on that band Saliva,"
52:47;52:50;"and I was like, ""I f--- with this dude, Josie from Saliva."
52:50;52:52;"""Definitely way more than Nickelback."""
52:52;52:54;"Although, maybe Nickelback's okay, too."
52:54;52:57;"Anyway, I think what we're learning here"
52:57;53:01;"is that biases against certain styles of music and musicians"
53:01;53:04;"come in and out of fashion, man, and it's all just posturing."
53:04;53:10;"# Well, the clock says it's time to close now"
53:10;53:19;"# I guess I'd better go now"
53:19;53:27;"# I really like to stay here all night"
53:29;53:34;"# The cars crawl past all stuffed with ice"
53:34;53:38;"# Streetlights share their hollow glow"
53:38;53:42;"# Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise"
53:42;53:46;"# Still one place to go"
53:50;53:55;"# Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen"
53:55;53:59;"# While my mind may yoke and stow"
53:59;54:03;"# Turn me out in a while now, baby"
54:03;54:07;"# Stumbling into neon, growing old... #"
54:07;54:09;"But anyway, I gotta say, and I like both of them,"
54:09;54:12;"but the idea that Iggy Pop was so much more, you know,"
54:12;54:14;"ahead of the curve and smart and savvy,"
54:14;54:17;"and then you hear that Jim Morrison interview in 1969,"
54:17;54:19;"speaking up against fat shaming,"
54:19;54:22;"I would say if you compare Jim Morrison, Iggy Pop and Tom York,"
54:22;54:25;"all three of them, Jim Morrison is the one who's the most ahead of his time, man."
54:25;54:27;"I love it."
54:27;54:31;"Also, if there's any rock critics listening, like,"
54:31;54:33;"I like Tom York, I like Radiohead too,"
54:33;54:36;"I just wonder if today somebody is like,"
54:36;54:41;"""Hey man, you know, Jim Morrison struggled with fat shaming for his whole life."""
54:41;54:44;"I don't know if you ever heard this interview from 1969,"
54:44;54:46;"where he kind of like had to put an interviewer in his place,"
54:46;54:48;"and he was kind of speaking out against fat shaming,"
54:48;54:50;"like, way before it was fashionable."
54:50;54:54;"Like, do you ever think about how multiple times in the early days,"
54:54;54:56;"you were shitting all over Jim Morrison,"
54:56;54:59;"and he specifically mocked a dead man for his weight?"
54:59;55:01;"I wonder if Tom York would be like,"
55:01;55:04;"""I was really insecure, man, in the early days of Radiohead."
55:04;55:06;"I honestly thought I was too skinny,"
55:06;55:10;"and it made me feel better about myself to make fun of Jim Morrison for being fat,"
55:10;55:13;"and yeah, it was easy because he was dead."""
55:13;55:16;"And I know our first album was just really generic alt-rock."
55:16;55:17;"And realistically--"
55:17;55:20;"I was insecure, and I hadn't found my voice yet artistically."
55:20;55:24;"It wasn't until OK Computer that I could admit that I was OK too,"
55:24;55:26;"and I didn't need to punch down."
55:26;55:29;"And obviously, The Doors' first album is better than our first album."
55:29;55:31;"I did a little number crunching, and--"
55:31;55:33;"[laughter]"
55:33;55:37;"I found this 1993 profile of Radiohead from Details magazine."
55:37;55:38;"I don't know if you remember Details."
55:38;55:39;"Oh, yeah."
55:39;55:40;"Sure."
55:40;55:41;"Top Men's magazine from back in the day."
55:41;55:46;"And at one point, the interviewer compares Radiohead to Nirvana,"
55:46;55:52;"and Tom York is quoted saying that he looks ""incredibly like Kurt Cobain,"""
55:52;55:55;"but didn't have a ""fat, ugly wife."""
55:55;55:57;"Ooh!"
55:57;55:58;"And then--"
55:58;55:59;"Damn!"
55:59;56:02;"And then the next line is, ""Kurt Cobain was pretty sore about that."""
56:02;56:03;"Yo."
56:03;56:05;"Tell him a little bit of a frat boy."
56:05;56:09;"That's one year later after the Morrison thing."
56:09;56:10;"Jesus!"
56:10;56:14;"It looks like he tries to walk back the comment as a joke,"
56:14;56:16;"but at that point, the cat was already out of the bag."
56:16;56:17;"Wait, in the same interview?"
56:17;56:21;"Yeah, it goes, ""Oops, that was a joke. I didn't expect Kurt to read it."""
56:21;56:22;"Wait, wait."
56:22;56:25;"That just seems like in a subsequent interview he must have said that."
56:25;56:26;"You know what?"
56:26;56:30;"Maybe this interview is quoting a previous interview with Tom."
56:30;56:31;"Of course Kurt read it."
56:31;56:34;"The bottom line is Tom York fat-shamed Courtney Love."
56:34;56:35;"Ooh!"
56:35;56:37;"Around the same time."
56:37;56:39;"What the hell?"
56:39;56:41;"This is so funny."
56:41;56:43;"Oh, my God."
56:43;56:44;"I guess that also just goes to show--"
56:44;56:47;"Early radio ads, rough stuff, folks."
56:47;56:49;"Damn."
56:49;56:51;"Let's try to take a step back and not make it about Tom York"
56:51;56:54;"because, again, people change."
56:54;56:56;"Who knows what was going on with him back then?"
56:56;56:58;"I guess it also goes to show, though,"
56:58;57:01;"just how much the standards of what's fashionable on one hand"
57:01;57:04;"and what's okay to say changes so much."
57:04;57:05;"Oh, yeah."
57:05;57:08;"Because just picture Tom York's always been kind of like"
57:08;57:10;"a lefty, buck-against-the-system dude."
57:10;57:12;"I bet he always cared about what are his passions,"
57:12;57:13;"the environment, things like that."
57:13;57:15;"I bet that hasn't changed."
57:15;57:16;"It's just that back then--"
57:16;57:17;"Oh, yeah."
57:17;57:18;"You could just say, like--"
57:18;57:20;"Just imagine, like, a young rock band coming out today"
57:20;57:23;"and one of the first interviews somebody did"
57:23;57:25;"was about another prominent person's wife"
57:25;57:27;"and they called them fat."
57:27;57:28;"I think it might be a rap."
57:28;57:30;"People will lose their mind."
57:30;57:33;"So I assume that Tom York doesn't speak that way anymore."
57:33;57:34;"But you know what?"
57:34;57:36;"I'm going to try to take a positive spin on all this"
57:36;57:38;"because I do think Tom York's made a lot of beautiful music"
57:38;57:41;"for the world and probably has done a lot of good for the world."
57:41;57:45;"I think it just goes to show that people who are thrust--"
57:45;57:47;"and I think it's probably even worse now that, like--"
57:47;57:49;"Yeah, young people are just--"
57:49;57:52;"People are thrust into the spectacle of music"
57:52;57:54;"and it's so inherently competitive."
57:54;57:57;"People are just so desperate to just talk [bleep] about each other"
57:57;58:00;"or to prove why I'm better than that person or something."
58:00;58:03;"I feel like-- Wait, was this like Brandon Wardell or somebody?"
58:03;58:05;"There's some kind of funny tweet or something"
58:05;58:09;"that was basically saying how, like, art or music or whatever"
58:09;58:12;"is basically just like sports for nerds or something."
58:12;58:14;"Is this competitive?"
58:14;58:19;"Yeah, that it's funny because sports at least doesn't make a claim"
58:19;58:24;"to be getting at the inner truths of what it means to be a good person."
58:24;58:26;"The essence of humanity."
58:26;58:29;"Yeah, whereas-- I mean, some people probably say that about sports,"
58:29;58:32;"but music does, and there is something kind of refreshing"
58:32;58:34;"about just being like, ""Let's keep it real."""
58:34;58:39;"Some of the same impulses that are pushing the linebacker"
58:39;58:42;"on the football field to just crush the other dude"
58:42;58:45;"because they want the sweet taste of success,"
58:45;58:47;"they want to win so badly,"
58:47;58:49;"they want to prove that they're better than their competitors,"
58:49;58:52;"to pretend that that is something that only exists in sports or jocks"
58:52;58:54;"or something like, ""Give me a break."""
58:54;58:57;"Even Tom York, everything about him should scream ""sensitive."""
58:57;58:59;"His lyrics are sensitive and stuff."
58:59;59:01;"And even him, at one point in his life,"
59:01;59:04;"wanted to lash out against Curt and Courtney's feelings"
59:04;59:07;"or hurt Jim Morrison's feelings."
59:07;59:11;"So rather than look at that as a failure of Tom York's in particular,"
59:11;59:13;"because I don't think that's fair, I would say that's just what"
59:13;59:15;"this crazy world does to people."
59:15;59:18;"Good, sensitive people can be really mean"
59:18;59:21;"when they think that their whole life depends on it."
59:21;59:23;"And a lot of people, when they're out there doing their interviews"
59:23;59:26;"or tweeting or whatever, sometimes they can feel like"
59:26;59:30;"their whole life depends on building a brand that's edgy"
59:30;59:33;"and puts down the right people."
59:33;59:36;"Back in the early '90s, you could do that by calling people fat."
59:36;59:38;"Today, you're not allowed to do it by calling people fat."
59:38;59:41;"People have woken up to just how horribly cruel that is."
59:41;59:45;"But there might be other things that a young Tom York type might say."
59:45;59:48;"So maybe we've got to give him some sympathy too."
59:48;59:50;"He was so young."
59:50;59:53;"If I had been in a huge rock band when I was 22,"
59:53;59:55;"I would have said some dumb things too."
59:55;59:59;"The funny thing is that when he was 24, they weren't even that huge yet,"
59:59;01:00:01;"so he was probably even more edgy."
01:00:01;01:00:04;"The full context of that, it's not like modern-day Tom York"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"being asked about Kurt Cobain."
01:00:06;01:00:09;"It's kind of like young, one-hit wonder Tom York"
01:00:09;01:00:12;"being asked about a more respected singer."
01:00:12;01:00:14;"And he'd be like, ""Well, at least my girlfriend's not fat!"""
01:00:14;01:00:17;"It's like he was a member of Oasis back then."
01:00:17;01:00:20;"Tom York, oh, yeah, just talking s***."
01:00:20;01:00:23;"Just brutal, taking the piss out of Kurt."
01:00:23;01:00:26;"Although, to be fair--I can't remember if I brought this up on Time Crisis before--"
01:00:26;01:00:29;"Kurt used to say unkind things about the dead."
01:00:29;01:00:31;"He wore a T-shirt that said, like--"
01:00:31;01:00:32;"""Kill the dead."""
01:00:32;01:00:34;"""Kill the dead. Kill the grateful dead."""
01:00:34;01:00:35;"""Lighten up, Kurt."""
01:00:35;01:00:38;"Yeah, so everybody's got to beat down on somebody else."
01:00:38;01:00:42;"This is what I was thinking"
01:00:42;01:00:47;"About our bodies"
01:00:47;01:00:52;"What they mean"
01:00:52;01:00:59;"For our salvation"
01:00:59;01:01:04;"With only the clothes that"
01:01:04;01:01:09;"We stand up in"
01:01:09;01:01:13;"Just the ground"
01:01:13;01:01:21;"On which we stand"
01:01:21;01:01:26;"Is the darkness"
01:01:26;01:01:31;"Ours to take"
01:01:31;01:01:35;"Bathe in lightness"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"Bathe in heat"
01:01:37;01:01:41;"It's interesting to think that in the early '90s,"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"a guy who'd gone on to be very influential,"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"Tom York, is out there calling Jim Morrison"
01:01:45;01:01:48;"a ""fat, talentless bastard."""
01:01:48;01:01:49;"And then ten years later,"
01:01:49;01:01:50;"a new guy comes on the scene"
01:01:50;01:01:53;"who's going to have an even bigger impact on culture."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"His name's Kanye West,"
01:01:55;01:01:56;"and he hears a song called ""5 to 1."""
01:01:56;01:01:57;"He says, ""You know what?"
01:01:57;01:02:00;"I want to make a beat using this song."
01:02:00;01:02:02;"I'm going to have my good friend Jay-Z rap on it."""
01:02:02;01:02:03;"The rest is history, man."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"Ten years."
01:02:04;01:02:05;"It's a short time in some ways."
01:02:05;01:02:07;"In other ways, it's a long time."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"Jim Morrison went from being a punchline"
01:02:09;01:02:13;"to the backbone of a significant rap song"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"on a very special album"
01:02:15;01:02:18;"that brought a producer named Kanye West to prominence."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"Another ten years forward,"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"Kanye is killing it."
01:02:21;01:02:24;"[laughs]"
01:02:24;01:02:28;"People love his worldview in 2018."
01:02:28;01:02:30;"I watched SNL the other night."
01:02:30;01:02:31;"Yeah, what'd you think about that?"
01:02:31;01:02:34;"I thought the new songs just sucked."
01:02:34;01:02:37;"Although I did like the Perrier bottle costume."
01:02:37;01:02:38;"At least that was fun."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"That was fun."
01:02:39;01:02:40;"I was like, ""What are these songs?"""
01:02:40;01:02:41;"He's just standing there."
01:02:41;01:02:43;"I mean, there's not much to say about it."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"Yeah."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"And I even feel like all the ink spilled on Kanye."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"I see a lot of people who, like,"
01:02:47;01:02:48;"every time Kanye does something,"
01:02:48;01:02:49;"they're just, like, kind of tweeting,"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"""When can we stop talking about Kanye?"
01:02:51;01:02:53;"I cancel him. He's done."""
01:02:53;01:02:54;"Yeah."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"And it's kind of like, ""Be the change, man."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"Be the f---ing change."""
01:02:57;01:02:59;"So anyway, I think if you really, really"
01:02:59;01:03:00;"have a problem with Kanye,"
01:03:00;01:03:03;"my feeling is I don't think Kanye's convincing anybody"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"to support Donald Trump."
01:03:04;01:03:05;"No."
01:03:05;01:03:06;"It's kind of like half of his audience is like,"
01:03:06;01:03:07;"""We're done with you,"""
01:03:07;01:03:08;"and the other half is like,"
01:03:08;01:03:10;"""Yeah, yeah, can we hear the music?"""
01:03:10;01:03:12;"But the one kind of sad thing"
01:03:12;01:03:14;"is that he's right about a few things."
01:03:14;01:03:17;"He's right about that he wants to challenge orthodoxy"
01:03:17;01:03:20;"and that there's got to be more than two sides"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"to the story of American politics."
01:03:22;01:03:23;"Sure."
01:03:23;01:03:24;"The brutal part is that he,"
01:03:24;01:03:26;"for such a forward-thinking guy, he can't find--"
01:03:26;01:03:28;"Like, I get it if Kanye wants to say,"
01:03:28;01:03:29;"""Why should I be a Democrat?"""
01:03:29;01:03:31;"That's a great question, man."
01:03:31;01:03:33;"Find a more forward-thinking answer."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"I'd love to know."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"Or a specific one."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"He's just like, ""Use your heart, not your head."""
01:03:37;01:03:40;"And it's like, ""Well, no, actually,"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"you should use your head."""
01:03:42;01:03:43;"Use your head and your heart together."
01:03:43;01:03:46;"Anyway, I got to say, maybe it's 'cause he's dead,"
01:03:46;01:03:50;"but we've been talking about Tom York, Kanye..."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"Cobain."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"Cobain, Jim Morrison."
01:03:52;01:03:53;"I got to say, again,"
01:03:53;01:03:55;"maybe just 'cause door season is approaching,"
01:03:55;01:03:57;"Jim Morrison kind of seems increasingly"
01:03:57;01:03:59;"like the coolest of the bunch, man."
01:03:59;01:04:01;"Let's throw in some more doors."
01:04:01;01:04:03;"What's some other good doors?"
01:04:03;01:04:04;"""Break on Through""?"
01:04:04;01:04:05;"That's, like, already, like,"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"that was the first single, ""Out the Gate."""
01:04:07;01:04:08;"That [bleep] is hard."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"Another just [bleep] hard song."

01:09:40;01:09:43;"but I guess inspired by the Eminem, Machine Gun Kelly beef,"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"he wanted to do his own thing,"
01:09:45;01:09:50;"and he made a song called ""Vampire Slayer"" over the MGK song ""Rap Devil's Beat."""

01:10:48;01:10:53;"He's really good, too, with the different vocal textures on each verse."
01:10:53;01:10:55;"The production was very dialed in."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"Yeah, this guy has a real mic."

01:11:03;01:11:07;"I guess the proper response would be for me to release a Vampire Weekend album."
01:11:07;01:11:10;"[Laughter]"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"So we'll see about that."
01:11:12;01:11:15;"You know what I like about Patrick's rapping?"
01:11:15;01:11:17;"He didn't go below the belt."
01:11:17;01:11:18;"I get it."
01:11:18;01:11:19;"Fair enough."
01:11:19;01:11:20;"Where the hell is the album?"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"I understand that people want the album."
01:11:22;01:11:25;"I know that 8 Minute Cape Cod is not going to cut it for the fan base,"
01:11:25;01:11:27;"whatever's left of it."
01:11:27;01:11:28;"And I like the callback."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"He's like, ""God, Seinfeld, let me get a number crunch."""
01:11:30;01:11:31;"Oh, yeah, that's a great one."

01:11:44;01:11:46;"You about to drop a hot coffee pot?"
01:11:46;01:11:47;"[Laughter]"
01:11:47;01:11:49;"Well, now it's time for the actual top five."
01:11:49;01:11:50;"Let's get in."
01:11:50;01:11:53;"It's time for the top five."
01:11:53;01:11:57;"Five on iTunes."
01:11:57;01:12:02;"This week on the top five, we're doing the greatest hits of 1968"
01:12:02;01:12:07;"as compared with the top five songs on iTunes right now in 2018."
01:12:07;01:12:08;"Why 1968?"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"It's 50 years ago."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"That's intense, 50 years ago."
01:12:12;01:12:14;"Time crisis classic year."
01:12:14;01:12:16;"I feel like we've done '68 many times."
01:12:16;01:12:17;"It's a major year."
01:12:17;01:12:22;"And then, you know, going full circle, it was the year that Steakums--"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"Was invented."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"I wonder if that was before or after popcorn chicken."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"That's a question for the agents."
01:12:28;01:12:31;"I feel like being a food technologist is the type of thing that you could, like,"
01:12:31;01:12:34;"really get far with as a personal brand in 2018."
01:12:34;01:12:36;"But I feel like it would be anti-technology."
01:12:36;01:12:41;"I feel like food in 2018 would be, like, back to basics and, you know,"
01:12:41;01:12:44;"kombucha and kale smoothies and stuff."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"Although that stuff is starting to feel played out, right?"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"So I think that the future would be, like, inventing, like,"
01:12:48;01:12:50;"new types of popcorn chicken."
01:12:50;01:12:54;"Well, popcorn chicken using lab-grown meat."
01:12:54;01:12:55;"Right."
01:12:55;01:12:56;"That would be the new stuff."
01:12:56;01:12:58;"Or, like, an impossible burger."
01:12:58;01:12:59;"What is that?"
01:12:59;01:13:02;"It's a vegan burger that tastes a lot like a burger."
01:13:02;01:13:03;"I've had it. It's good."
01:13:03;01:13:07;"They somehow create hemoglobin from plant whatever."
01:13:07;01:13:10;"I would love to eat a lab-grown burger."
01:13:10;01:13:12;"Just to help Mother Earth?"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"Yeah, I mean, I think that's going to happen eventually, right?"
01:13:14;01:13:17;"Isn't that sort of going to be the future at some point?"
01:13:17;01:13:19;"Yeah, I don't see why they couldn't get it right."
01:13:19;01:13:21;"It seems cool."
01:13:21;01:13:22;"It could probably save the world."
01:13:22;01:13:24;"If you could grow a burger without, you know,"
01:13:24;01:13:27;"using enormous amounts of resources and suffering."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"Yeah."
01:13:28;01:13:29;"I don't know. I'm on board."
01:13:29;01:13:30;"I'd eat it."
01:13:30;01:13:32;"Oh, we should also point out that 1968 was the year"

01:46:40;01:46:44;"So it could either be Jules or John."
01:46:44;01:46:45;"Or dude."
01:46:45;01:46:47;"Yeah, and every time he's like, ""Yeah, you know,"""
01:46:47;01:46:51;"he said he thought that--he always said that Jude was Jules,"
01:46:51;01:46:55;"my son, but also thought, you know, Jude rhymes with dude."
01:46:55;01:46:57;"You wouldn't call a little boy dude."
01:46:57;01:47:00;"I always thought that maybe I was the dude that he was talking to."
01:47:00;01:47:01;"Oh, God, this accent was so bad."
01:47:01;01:47:04;"Imagine if the song was called ""Hey, Dude."""

01:52:22;01:52:28;"My rock. I've seen references to this online where like Cooper was sort of modeling himself"
01:52:28;01:52:32;"after Eddie Vedder. And then I saw this like a quote where Eddie Vedder said, like, don't"
01:52:32;01:52:33;"make it."
01:52:33;01:52:38;"The thing that I didn't click on that was like Vedder was like, don't do that, bro."
01:52:38;01:52:45;"I remember I heard about this movie in the early days of development. And I remember"
01:52:45;01:52:49;"hearing somebody being like, oh, they're going to remake a star is born and Bradley Cooper's"
01:52:49;01:52:54;"going to play a singer and he's going to be kind of a kind of like an Eddie Vedder grunge"
01:52:54;01:52:59;"type. And I was just like, what? How is he not playing a country dude? If he actually"
01:52:59;01:53:00;"stuck to his guns."
01:53:00;01:53:03;"It's a little ambiguous in the trailer. I'm actually seeing the trailer."
01:53:03;01:53:04;"Yeah, I saw the trailer."
01:53:04;01:53:08;"The trailer is a little ambiguous. It's like, well, is this like a Chris Stapleton kind"
01:53:08;01:53:13;"of guy? Like the impression I got from the trailer was more of a country guy. Yeah. Not"
01:53:13;01:53:18;"that he was like the frontman of a gigantic rock band. More of the guy that was on like"
01:53:18;01:53:24;"the backside of his career, almost like Jeff Bridges. And, um, what was that movie called?"
01:53:24;01:53:29;"Crazy heart. Yeah. But like 20 years younger than that character, but like, you know, a"
01:53:29;01:53:34;"dude that's playing like the L Ray theater or something."
01:53:34;01:53:36;"This movie has like incredible reviews."
01:53:36;01:53:41;"That's shocking to me. It looks so corny, this movie. I mean, don't get me wrong. I'll"
01:53:41;01:53:42;"see it."
01:53:42;01:53:45;"94% on rotten tomatoes."
01:53:45;01:53:46;"Rotten tomatoes is garbage."
01:53:46;01:53:49;"Yeah. Way out with RT."
01:53:49;01:53:54;"I feel like generally when there's like a big major event and I get a bad feeling that"
01:53:54;01:53:58;"I'm not going to like it, but then everybody's like, no, actually, yo, low key. It's really"
01:53:58;01:54:02;"good. I still don't like it. Yeah. That's generally been my impression."
01:54:02;01:54:07;"Oh, absolutely. Have you seen Mandy? That's it? Like a 95% in Rotten Tomatoes. It's a"
01:54:07;01:54:14;"horror movie. Nicholas Cage movie. It's like this eighties pastiche. I couldn't believe"
01:54:14;01:54:15;"it's 95% in Rotten Tomatoes."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"You thought it was trash?"
01:54:17;01:54:23;"Pretty much. It's a giant like F you. There's like a couple of crazy scenes in it. And then"
01:54:23;01:54:28;"it's like this like low budget, boring movie. It's just like, it's not that good."
01:54:28;01:54:34;"Really? You know, I don't like to talk, but I've seen a few things recently that seemingly"
01:54:34;01:54:38;"everybody liked. And I was just like, this sucks."
01:54:38;01:54:39;"Movie wise or what?"
01:54:39;01:54:41;"I don't even want to say content."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"Don't talk to me about succession."
01:54:42;01:54:48;"No, not succession. I'm willing to check out succession. I just think various forms of"
01:54:48;01:54:49;"content."
01:54:49;01:54:53;"If you want to talk to me about the Jack Ryan adaptation on Amazon, then I'm game."
01:54:53;01:54:54;"With Krasinski?"
01:54:54;01:54:55;"Terrible."
01:54:55;01:54:56;"Oh, there's no way that's..."
01:54:56;01:54:57;"Garbage."
01:54:57;01:55:02;"Well, Bradley Cooper's character in A Star is Born is named Jackson Maine. That sounds"
01:55:02;01:55:03;"like more of a country singer."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"That is so weak."
01:55:05;01:55:08;"Jackson Maine is not the lead singer of a grunge band."
01:55:08;01:55:09;"No."
01:55:09;01:55:13;"I think we discussed this, that grunge singers had like their name, Vedder, Cobain."
01:55:13;01:55:15;"Yeah, they're weird ass names."
01:55:15;01:55:16;"Kind of weird."
01:55:16;01:55:21;"Jackson Maine is like the captain of the lacrosse team."
01:55:21;01:55:26;"I guess when I try not to be a hater, when I consume content and I'm like, oh, this sucks."
01:55:26;01:55:31;"Everybody's stupid. I don't want to participate in this world. I guess the good way to look"
01:55:31;01:55:35;"at it is like, you know what? Maybe even if something's not that good to have everybody"
01:55:35;01:55:39;"kind of rally around and be like, we're all going to kind of enjoy this thing and talk"
01:55:39;01:55:41;"about it. Maybe there's something good about that."
01:55:41;01:55:42;"You watching the Deuce?"
01:55:42;01:55:43;"No, is the Deuce good?"
01:55:43;01:55:44;"It's great."
01:55:44;01:55:45;"Yeah?"
01:55:45;01:55:46;"Nick's giving me a look."
01:55:46;01:55:47;"I just feel like..."
01:55:47;01:55:49;"Well, I'm a solo and I'm flying solo on this."
01:55:49;01:55:51;"I just starting to feel like, you know..."
01:55:51;01:55:52;"Best show on TV."
01:55:52;01:55:55;"All this is, you know, just I feel like, oh, you always got to watch a new TV show."
01:55:55;01:55:56;"I know."
01:55:56;01:55:59;"Always going to be a new part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
01:55:59;01:56:00;"Well, I know."
01:56:00;01:56:02;"Always going to be new albums."
01:56:02;01:56:03;"I don't listen to music."
01:56:03;01:56:07;"I do think the only ethical form of content is internet radio."
01:56:07;01:56:08;"I'm sorry."
01:56:08;01:56:13;"In 2018, when there is just way too much content..."
01:56:13;01:56:14;"Just tune in the TC."
01:56:14;01:56:16;"There's just way too much content on the planet."
01:56:16;01:56:18;"The planet can't support this much content."
01:56:18;01:56:20;"It's frankly unethical to make content."
01:56:20;01:56:25;"And the only decent content is internet radio because it's just comes and goes."
01:56:25;01:56:27;"It's not taking up space anywhere."
01:56:27;01:56:28;"It just streams..."
01:56:28;01:56:30;"Except on a hard drive, bro."
01:56:30;01:56:31;"It's the only ethical form of content."
01:56:31;01:56:32;"Internet radio."
01:56:32;01:56:33;"I said it."
01:56:33;01:56:34;"Lady Gaga."
01:56:34;01:56:37;"A Star is Born should have been an internet radio show."
01:56:37;01:56:40;"Succession should have been an internet radio show."
01:56:40;01:56:44;"The Carter Five by Lil Wayne should have been an internet radio show."
01:56:44;01:56:46;"Well, hell of a program."
01:56:46;01:56:49;"I will say one thing."
01:56:49;01:56:53;"I love that the number one song on iTunes has like fake crowd sound and like..."
01:56:53;01:56:54;"That's tight."
01:56:54;01:56:55;"Yeah."
01:56:55;01:56:56;"That song is cool."
01:56:56;01:56:58;"Shout out to the writers."
01:56:58;01:57:00;"Andrew Wyatt, hell of a songwriter."
01:57:00;01:57:01;"Mark Ronson, hell of a songwriter."
01:57:01;01:57:03;"Anthony Rossamondo, hell of a songwriter."
01:57:03;01:57:04;"Lady Gaga, hell of a songwriter."
01:57:04;01:57:05;"That's quite a quartet."
01:57:05;01:57:08;"I don't know this producer, Benjamin Rice."
01:57:08;01:57:11;"Welcome to my life."
01:57:11;01:57:14;"Just the end of the song."
01:57:14;01:57:17;"Welcome to my life."
01:57:17;01:57:25;"You could just add that to any song."
01:57:25;01:57:26;"All right."
