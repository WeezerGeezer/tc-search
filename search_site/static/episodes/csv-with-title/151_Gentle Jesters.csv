01:31;01:35;"hot here. I was like I hope I got ice-cold beer in the fridge but as previously"
01:35;01:40;"discussed I don't remember to do beer runs so when the beer is out it's out."
01:40;01:47;"But luckily we did have some Sofia Coppola California carbonated white wine"
01:47;01:51;"in the fridge so that's what I'm drinking. Wow wait a second she has her"
01:51;01:58;"own line? Yeah it's called Sofia and she and Rashida are friends and Rashida starred in"

02:18;02:24;"Geyserville Jake? I have yeah. Really? Yeah. That surprises you? Well I mean no it"
02:24;02:27;"doesn't surprise me. I feel like Jake has been to most many deep towns in"
02:27;02:31;"California but like why would you go to Geyserville to go to like a"
02:31;02:36;"Francis Ford Coppola winery? Yeah just you know me and the boys were you know"
02:36;02:40;"on a wine tasting trip up in Napa one weekend. Well I do know that Jake is a"
02:40;02:44;"big fan of the film Sideways. That's a top 10 film. Was there a period where you"
02:44;02:49;"ditched brews and you got really into wine for a few years? That's down the"
02:49;02:55;"road still. Okay. I've been in that Napa Sonoma area quite a few times in my life."
02:55;03:02;"I can't even tell you why. Usually in route to somewhere else but I haven't"
03:02;03:06;"like gone deep on Geyserville but. But you got out of the car. I've gone deep on"
03:06;03:11;"Guerneville but not Geyserville. Yeah yeah I've gotten out of the car. So how's"
03:11;03:16;"that working out? This wine? Yeah. It's good. It's a decent substitute for beer."
03:16;03:22;"It's in a tasteful little can. Nice lightly carbonated. Good flavor. Yeah not"
03:22;03:27;"as dry as some champagnes. I don't like when champagne's too dry. Oof. That's just a"
03:27;03:32;"straight headache for me. Yeah yeah. You got to make beer a grocery item. Right. You're"
03:32;03:37;"getting your Cheerios, your granola, your Swiss chard. Laundry detergent. Yeah. And"
03:37;03:42;"the beer. Pick up at 12. You don't have to drink it every day. Just have it ready"
03:42;03:48;"to go so in a pinch you're prepped. Yep I gotta remember that. I'll text you"
03:48;03:53;"tomorrow. Don't forget. Hey dude reminder. That kind of sounds like a 90s beer"
03:53;04:01;"commercial. Bros remind bros to do beer runs. Or you could also picture like a"
04:01;04:05;"whole campaign. This really actually sounds like some like Mad Men Madison"
04:05;04:11;"Avenue type sh*t. Where it's like alright people love beer and this probably"
04:11;04:16;"actually happened. People love beer but we find for like the very casual beer"
04:16;04:20;"drinker, the internet radio show host kind of guy, he's just grabbing like one"
04:20;04:25;"beer a week and when he's out he'll go months before he refills. How do we get"
04:25;04:30;"that guy to keep the house a little more stocked, squeeze out another you know 50"
04:30;04:34;"bucks out of him a year? We got to make beer a grocery item for this guy and"
04:34;04:39;"that's what the next three years are about for the Budweiser company. We're"
04:39;04:45;"making sure that the casual beer drinker understands that beer is a grocery item"
04:45;04:49;"and yeah and then like the it's like I don't know what it is it's like bros"
04:49;04:53;"reminding bros just like beer's a grocery item man. It's like two in the"
04:53;05:00;"list. It's gotta be the phrase grocery item. Dude it's a grocery item. Yeah"
05:00;05:04;"cuz maybe they're like what are the... That's very like very Coen Brothers."
05:04;05:12;"Like a character who says grocery item a lot. It's a grocery item man and like"
05:12;05:17;"yeah you have like your weird like Walter Sobchak or Yumi and Dupree type"
05:17;05:21;"like just weird beer dude. Beer's a grocery item. Actually you would probably get"
05:21;05:26;"John Goodman as Walter Sobchak to be like it's like the the husband and wife"
05:26;05:31;"sitting at the table and she's just like all right doing the grocery list I got"
05:31;05:36;"eggs I think we're actually out of oatmeal I want to try new detergent"
05:36;05:40;"anything else and the guy's like doesn't know if he can add beer he's thinking"
05:40;05:44;"instead I don't know can I really add beer to our family grocery list and then"
05:44;05:48;"like pans out to Walter Sobchak. Beer is a grocery item dude. Add it."
05:48;05:53;"Samantha add it. I don't know if I consider beer to be a grocery item. Beer"
05:53;05:57;"is a grocery item. Mark it in. Add it. Put it down. You think I'm effing around here? I"
05:57;06:02;"really think there probably is a type of person maybe like upper-middle-class"
06:02;06:07;"professional who probably they don't want beer to be a grocery item they're"
06:07;06:11;"like you know what I'll go to get beer at the liquor store I'll see a bottle of"
06:11;06:16;"wine the kind of bougie person I'll see a bottle of wine that can sit right next"
06:16;06:23;"to my you know the diapers for the baby the brie. I like in this fantasy the"
06:23;06:28;"diapers are in the fridge. No no I mean this is their anxiety when they're"
06:28;06:33;"checking out at the supermarket. Right right my baby likes cold diapers. I think"
06:33;06:38;"what you're getting at is this is like the big Madison Avenue move because it's"
06:38;06:42;"not just you're not saying that there's just a guy who they need to sort of"
06:42;06:46;"convert to say hey it's a grocery item but you're basically talking about"
06:46;06:51;"normalizing beer as a grocery item like it's sort of like that's the kind of"
06:51;06:54;"thing that I think really gets Madison Avenue excited is like we're talking"
06:54;06:59;"about it's a cultural shift. It's a paradigm shift. Cultural shift. Beer is a grocery item."
06:59;07:04;"Normalized beer is a grocery item. I also think the same way that like probably"
07:04;07:09;"certain products benefit just because they became so classic as like"
07:09;07:14;"grocery items like I mean I really like eggs but you know it's not like every"
07:14;07:19;"culture consumes as many eggs as like the average American that's because we"
07:19;07:23;"got in people's heads when you're going to the grocery store you're getting eggs"
07:23;07:26;"and there's probably some people who wake up one day after 40 years of buying"
07:26;07:29;"eggs they're like I don't like eggs I could have been eating different for"
07:29;07:33;"breakfast I don't with eggs I don't bake I don't like eating them why was I"
07:33;07:36;"buying eggs all this time it's because that's a top five grocery item survey"
07:36;07:41;"says eggs ding you know what I mean they're buying eggs and there's other"
07:41;07:45;"like that you just get in people's heads where they're just like I better get"
07:45;07:50;"eggs and milk oh milk is a class red I mean first of all straight up Madison"
07:50;07:54;"milk is wild Madison Avenue teamed up with the dairy industry to basically say"
07:54;07:58;"milk is a grocery item like what are you crazy you're gonna go to the grocery"
07:58;08:02;"store and you didn't bring back milk you need milk for every year yeah I wonder"
08:02;08:07;"what year like was the height of American per capita milk consumption"
08:07;08:12;"it's got to be down from its height but right we'll still rocking it and you go"
08:12;08:17;"to the grocery store there's still ample valuable real estate given over to me"
08:17;08:23;"literally got milk is normalizing milk as a grocery item right it's saying when"
08:23;08:28;"I walk into your house do you better be milk there better be milk in the no and"
08:28;08:31;"I bet there are probably all sorts of people who like bought into that where"
08:31;08:36;"they were just like I'm lactose intolerant I don't drink me I don't"
08:36;08:41;"drink milk but I've been buying like you know a liter of milk regularly you know"
08:41;08:46;"just in case somebody comes through who needs some milk"
08:46;08:51;"my lover's gone away the bottle stands for a symbol of the door"
08:51;08:58;"no milk today it seems a common sight but people passing by don't know the"
08:58;09:04;"reason why how could they know just what this message means the end of my hopes"
09:04;09:11;"the end of all my dreams how could they know a palace there had been behind the"
09:11;09:15;"door when my love reigned as queen I would guess that milk consumption"
09:15;09:22;"probably peaked in the 80s and maybe the got milk campaign of the 90s was them"
09:22;09:25;"being like whoa we're slipping a little bit what's going on let's remind these"
09:25;09:30;"mother they need milk in their house and then the last 20 years have really been"
09:30;09:34;"a bloodbath because they got oat milk almond milk coming out of the woodwork"
09:34;09:37;"and they're really on the ropes I mean milk consumption is probably"
09:37;09:44;"cratering rice cashew do your kids drink milk yeah you want to have growing boys"
09:44;09:48;"at the house do your boys drink milk straight up he's definitely not slamming"
09:48;09:52;"a glass of milk oh he's not okay I don't know like I used to drink milk when I"
09:52;10:00;"was a kid yeah I was at someone's house and was helping them with their espresso"
10:00;10:04;"machine I was gonna make them a coffee like a latte and I was like do you have"
10:04;10:11;"milk and they said dairy and I was like yeah I'm afraid like a cabinet go you"
10:11;10:16;"drink dairy in 2021 cow's milk it's truly a thing it would have been like"
10:16;10:21;"whatever you eat gluten in 2018 yeah I didn't know that I mean I guess no I"
10:21;10:25;"mean our metal stuff well look in your you know this is probably in a very"
10:25;10:30;"specific slice of the bourgeois LA world which we're all very familiar with on"
10:30;10:38;"but I'm concerned that beer could go the way of milk because beer a lot of people"
10:38;10:44;"associate with gluten these trends do kind of like become just these weird"
10:44;10:49;"cultural biases right now I could imagine going to like some kind of"
10:49;10:52;"coastal big city and rolling to somebody's house being like you got a"
10:52;10:56;"beer and they'd be like beer you know there was a time where I'm sake and in"
10:56;11:03;"tequila yeah I can make you a skinny margarita but we don't have beer but"
11:03;11:07;"that could spread and if I was a beer executive I'd be nervous about that and"
11:07;11:12;"then of course you have the rise of like white claws and actually true Seinfeld's"
11:12;11:17;"not on yet I don't know if we officially have a triage thing but I think Nick you"
11:17;11:22;"become the number cruncher when Seinfeld's not on yes I accept that so"
11:22;11:27;"Nick give me a sense of like where beer sales are at over the past like 30 years"
11:27;11:33;"are they down lately this is a tough number crunch I'm on it by the way just"
11:33;11:39;"speaking as I look this up milk it does look that just milk sales has been on a"
11:39;11:43;"steady decline since the 70s since the seven though they're just there yeah so"
11:43;11:48;"basically you know they're just fighting a trend so they're just trying to be"
11:48;11:53;"stable but it's been sort of yeah just on a steady decline I'm curious so about"
11:53;11:58;"your growing boys though do they eat cereal they put like rice milk on their"
11:58;12:03;"cereal what do they do in our house we always have oat milk or almond milk and"
12:03;12:07;"I think we have cows milk sometimes well the other thing I was thinking about is"
12:07;12:11;"like you like you know when you have like a baby the baby's drinking either"
12:11;12:16;"breast milk or formula right then at some point I feel like some parents like"
12:16;12:20;"transition like then the baby starts drinking like cows milk like starts"
12:20;12:25;"eating food right like real food and maybe formula or whatever but also like"
12:25;12:28;"I feel like I've run into this recently I've been you know obviously paying"
12:28;12:32;"closer attention to this this stuff I've been surprised we're like I've known a"
12:32;12:37;"few parents are just like well regularly give their kids like dairy milk mmm like"
12:37;12:42;"you know like a two-year-old or something I mean I'm happy when Max will"
12:42;12:46;"drink a glass of milk with you know it tends to only happen if he's like at"
12:46;12:50;"someone else's house and their kids will want a glass of milk with something but"
12:50;12:54;"yeah you're happy when he drinks a glass of cow's milk yeah I just feel like he"
12:54;12:59;"needs to get hit like calcium he just Nick but it's not a good sure these are"
12:59;13:02;"lies these are lies that were told relies by the dairy industry you grew up in the"
13:02;13:09;"shadow of the in the long big milk in the long decline of the milk industry"
13:09;13:13;"and they filled your head with lies there's no calcium in milk man this is"
13:13;13:18;"pure nostalgia so I'm just kidding there is calcium I was gonna say that I was"
13:18;13:21;"gonna say that it's like the biggest Mandela effect of all Oh milk does not"
13:21;13:27;"have calcium man there's more calcium in a beer than milk that's part of our"
13:27;13:33;"campaign wake up sheeple there's no calcium in milk although one thing I"
13:33;13:37;"will say is um eventually when time crisis goes full Rogan will like have"
13:37;13:40;"like a lot of like health people on to like really bear some of the stuff out"
13:40;13:44;"for now we'll stay in the zone of just like always speculating well that's what"
13:44;13:48;"Rogan does too right but he at least has these people on who supposedly know"
13:48;13:52;"about this stuff I have the sense that this idea that you just make your bones"
13:52;13:57;"stronger by slamming stuff that has calcium in it is like you know maybe not"
13:57;14:00;"the whole truth I think you make your bones stronger through powerlifting I"
14:00;14:04;"don't have the full number crunch but it definitely seems that beer has been on a"
14:04;14:09;"decline very specifically this year it's down 2% since the year before huh and I"
14:09;14:15;"and there is questions about which it surprises me you know if that has"
14:15;14:19;"anything to do with the pandemic because I know alcohol in general there was an"
14:19;14:25;"increase but maybe just less people just wanting to like pound beers quarantined"
14:25;14:29;"I mean that's just maybe not as appealing it's from a bygone era man"
14:29;14:35;"well yeah cuz it's liquor went up 30 this isn't so liquor went up 33% in 20"
14:35;14:41;"20 yeah wine Wow what you've I mean I had heard a lot around right alcohol"
14:41;14:45;"sales really increased with people stuck at home and you know try trying to keep"
14:45;14:51;"things in there going to bar wine sales gonna bars yep wine sales grew 12% but"
14:51;14:58;"beer sales went down 2% so that hurts all right we got a problem here the"

17:17;17:20;"is the new butter"
17:47;17:53;"well I thought um a good way we could do this episode is just actually to play"
17:53;17:57;"back the last episode and do kind of like a color commentary over it would"
17:57;18:01;"love that all right so we got the last episode queued up so the average time"
18:01;18:05;"Christ's episodes two hours so I imagine with commentary and stuff this one might"
18:05;18:10;"run to like close to four so let's go ahead and bump whoever's up next in the"
18:10;18:14;"schedule this is gonna be a long one folks but I think even if you heard you"
18:14;18:18;"know this will be valuable so anyway here now okay um that would actually"
18:18;18:22;"probably play like a normal time crisis if Jake just listen it was like oh man"
18:22;18:27;"well I just chiming in with different okay well Jake the main thing I want to"
18:27;18:31;"tell you that we found out on the last episode yeah this is big news drumroll"
18:31;18:38;"please we found out on the last episode that the first podcast the very first"
18:38;18:43;"the first podcast was a Grateful Dead song"
18:43;18:49;"what what do you mean was a song I know so I'm surprised as you are man but the"
18:49;18:52;"first podcast was a Grateful Dead song you got a flesh this out for me a"
18:52;18:56;"little more what does that mean all right you know podcasts I'm aware of the"
18:56;19:01;"form okay but the first one before there were any others was the Grateful Dead"
19:01;19:09;"song what which song was it US blues yeah all right part of the problem with"
19:09;19:13;"this that we discussed unless I had I had to just hit you with it like that"
19:13;19:17;"just to get your unvarnished yeah yeah it's like an excellent fun fact that"
19:17;19:23;"doesn't land it's cursed it's a cursed fun fact because on the one hand it's so"
19:23;19:27;"good and on the other it sounds so punchy and yet it doesn't actually make"
19:27;19:31;"any sense so basically we had despond on we're talking about he you know he has"
19:31;19:35;"his internet radio show and how people called a podcast and he just rolls with"
19:35;19:39;"it and then we started just digging into the history of podcasts and so we're"
19:39;19:44;"researching it live on the show wait despot has a show yeah chillin Island"
19:44;19:50;"okay cool soon to be a TV show by the way keep your eyes open for that so"
19:50;19:54;"anyway you're doing live Wikipedia we're doing some live week that's called live"
19:54;19:59;"wiki work it's a part of the internet radio skill set live wiki work as you"
19:59;20:02;"can imagine with something like a podcast there's different definitions of"
20:02;20:06;"what a podcast is so there's a little bit of debate about what the first one"
20:06;20:11;"was but basically the first time somebody used what is considered modern"
20:11;20:16;"podcast technology which is the RSS feed mm-hmm even if you don't really know"
20:16;20:19;"what that means like you've probably heard of RSS is having something to do"
20:19;20:23;"with like a podcast distribution network as I understand it that's some kind of"
20:23;20:29;"digital information distribution protocol that nobody had used for audio"
20:29;20:37;"until the year 2001 so the first time anybody used the RSS protocol to"
20:37;20:42;"distribute audio which became the whole basis for what podcasts are the first"
20:42;20:49;"piece of audio distributed that way was a former MTV VJ who was upset that"
20:49;20:55;"George W Bush had just been inaugurated and wanted to use this new internet"
20:55;21:02;"protocol that he was aware of to distribute a pithy song choice to make a"
21:02;21:07;"commentary about that moment in American history so he chose US blues by the"
21:07;21:12;"Grateful Dead and so that's the first piece of audio that ever went onto the"
21:12;21:16;"podcast distribution network there's like multiple articles that site Wow"
21:16;21:23;"that event as the first podcast Adam Curry he was like oh yeah I'm and of"
21:23;21:27;"course you know the naysayers could say well that's not a podcast that was just"
21:27;21:31;"a song but he was doing a kind of political commentary on it so you know"
21:31;21:35;"he was using the first podcast was a Grateful Dead song man that seems so"
21:35;21:40;"fitting and also that song choice it seems very fitting yeah very fitting and"
21:40;21:43;"then we were kind of talking about how just like when I tried to hit you with"
21:43;21:48;"it it's so close to sounding like a great fun fact that maybe you're talking"
21:48;21:52;"to a dead head at a party in Silicon Valley or something you could have sit"
21:52;21:54;"down with like hey you know you know it's interesting I actually just found"
21:54;21:57;"out that the first podcast was a Grateful Dead song but then everybody's"
21:57;22:01;"reaction is just gonna be like wait what does that mean it demands too much"
22:01;22:06;"explanation in context to like I know I'm to drop on anybody tempted to ask"
22:06;22:11;"you about like the nitty-gritty of the RSS feed by I'm gonna let's not do that"
22:11;22:14;"let's let's keep moving forward I wouldn't have the answers but I mean I"
22:14;22:19;"like it's that's the dawn of the 21st century the century of American decline"
22:19;22:25;"yeah it's perfect it's perfect way that's really very poetic maybe in"
22:25;22:30;"between songs at the next Richard Pictures rehearsal you could try it out"
22:30;22:36;"hey fellas you know it's funny the first podcast was actually US blues wait what"
22:36;22:40;"you think we're actually gonna do that song you're gonna do you as blues yeah"
22:40;22:44;"people were throwing it out last practice outside that our first practice"
22:44;22:48;"last week so okay so you got a great fun fact to hit them with very excited about"
22:48;22:55;"that trying to explain it yeah the first audio file and an RSS that was live at"
22:55;23:00;"the old town pub all right guys the next song is one of my favorite dead tunes"
23:00;23:06;"it's also the first podcast one two three four and then there's like one guy"
23:06;23:14;"at the back of the bar it's like oh yeah Adam Curry file to the RSS feed yeah"
23:14;23:18;"very cool you know that man a lot of people forget that this is the first"
23:18;23:23;"podcast you know we should have asked Bob we're about that last when he was on"
23:23;23:27;"the show you want to know something we asked there's a moment about it oh well"
23:27;23:34;"I'll say this is a huge and I I held my tongue oh there was a moment where"
23:34;23:41;"Hornsby said to Ezra do you want me to call Bob now he said you want me to call"
23:41;23:46;"Bobby and I almost interrupted yeah as we just said nah we don't need to do"
23:46;23:51;"that now and I was like oh Ezra I know I know I had mixed feelings about it but I"
23:51;23:54;"know you thought I knew you had thought about it to say no but there was a"
23:54;23:58;"moment right you know my thought process was it's just like I feel like Bob would"
23:58;24:01;"just be like what there's a couple either Bob would have just been like"
24:01;24:06;"what are you saying like yeah maybe he's just like what is this like a prank oh"
24:06;24:13;"maybe he'd be like put off by it he or I mean ideally he would go you'd call up"
24:13;24:16;"and it'd be like Bruce is on the phone it's like hey Bobby it's me Bruce I'm"
24:16;24:20;"I'm live I'm live with Ezra on time crisis knees and Bob's like okay and"
24:20;24:23;"he's like Ezra just told me something I wanted to hit you to it did you know the"
24:23;24:29;"first podcast was a dead tune US blues maybe Bobby just go like you know what I"
24:29;24:35;"didn't know that that's very cool Wow just like no questions like yeah yeah"
24:35;24:40;"Bob really has no idea what he's saying he's also not gonna inquire what he's"
24:40;24:43;"talking about he's just gonna be like uh-huh"
24:43;24:48;"well Bob he's got that old wisdom he's seen it all it's true no he's seen some"
24:48;24:53;"cosmic he's been to every Grateful Dead show he meditates took a lot of acid"
24:53;24:57;"back in the day maybe he would also just get it like instinctually like he's like"
24:57;25:02;"you know did you know that Bob and he's like well now I do Wow you know what I"
25:02;25:06;"did I just I had a sad thought I don't think he wrote that song but he"
25:06;25:10;"obviously he was part of the dead crew and as Bruce Hornsby pointed out he was"
25:10;25:19;"a very big booster for the internet and I wonder if J.P. Barlow no no I wonder"
25:19;25:24;"if Barlow before he passed away R.I.P. found out that the first podcast was a"
25:24;25:27;"Grateful Dead song I'm sure he knew that and even if he didn't know then he"
25:27;25:32;"knows now now that it's out in the cosmos rest in power the really deep"
25:32;25:36;"version this is the discussion that just keeps on giving two episodes in a row"
25:36;25:40;"but I think the really deep version is not even hitting up a deadhead or like"
25:40;25:44;"Bob we're about it is just like you know if you're ever at a party and there's"
25:44;25:49;"like like one of the guys from like pod save America and you're just kind of"
25:49;25:56;"like oh hey like a cool party hey man um did you know that uh hey John love it"
25:56;26:02;"did you know that the first podcast was a Grateful Dead song just blank stare"
26:02;26:06;"just yeah he'd probably be like what what the fuck does that mean and then"
26:06;26:10;"you just be like whoa hold on man you don't have to be a fan but show some"
26:10;26:15;"respect to the the audio content that paved the way for what you do today man"
26:15;26:21;"like it might not be your cup of tea but like that was the first podcast I don't"
26:21;26:25;"give a if you like the dead that was the first podcast and you know you've made"
26:25;26:31;"some bank off what that song did hanging out with the woman from call her daddy"
26:31;26:37;"you know the first podcast was a Grateful Dead song did that show sell"
26:37;26:42;"for a lot of money I heard something somewhere about like a lot of podcasts"
26:42;26:46;"are like selling for lots of money recently obviously Rogan yes well yeah"
26:46;26:50;"only Rogan's like a huge show this one's a huge show - it started I guess call you"
26:50;26:55;"it started on the barstool Network okay so it's a yeah I was at a fancy party in"
26:55;27:02;"Miami to celebrate the 60 million dollar sale of call her daddy and everybody"
27:02;27:06;"was giving speeches and getting drunk and at some point I started hitting a"
27:06;27:10;"champagne glass with a fork and I just said I just wanted to say it's amazing"
27:10;27:13;"what you've accomplished with the podcast and I think we all can agree"
27:13;27:19;"that we need to have a moment to you know pour some out for Jerry Garcia"
27:19;27:23;"because of course the first podcast was a Grateful Dead song not Adam Curry and"
27:23;27:26;"I'll say it Adam Curtis a little bit but you know Jerry's saying that song and"
27:26;27:30;"just like yelling at the DJ at the club my can you just turn the music off for a"
27:30;27:36;"second we're just we're just kind of having a moment here - sir sir we're"
27:36;27:39;"gonna do a minute of silence and then I want you to kick in with us blues and"
27:39;27:43;"then we'll kind of start parting again thank you"
27:43;27:46;"and white"
27:46;27:56;"blue suede shoes I'm uncle Sam how do you do"
27:56;28:02;"give me five still alive"
28:02;28:09;"ain't no luck I learned to duck"
28:12;28:15;"check my pulse"
28:15;28:18;"it don't change"
28:18;28:21;"stay 72"
28:21;28:25;"come shine or rain"
28:25;28:28;"wave the flag"
28:28;28:31;"pop the bag"
28:31;28:34;"rock the boat"
28:34;28:37;"skin the goat"
28:38;28:44;"all right we're now joined by Seinfeld back in the mix hey what's up so last"
28:44;28:49;"week I was browsing the internet and I saw a picture of a man wearing a t-shirt"
28:49;28:55;"that said breaking news with a kind of graphic in the style of like cable news"
28:55;29:00;"or like a new slick newspaper magazine I like a little bit of Fox News it's a"
29:00;29:06;"little Fox News yeah totally and it says breaking news in a big font and then"
29:06;29:11;"underneath I don't care with an exclamation point so it's kind of it's an"
29:11;29:15;"interesting it's like a fake out so it's like breaking news really official and"
29:15;29:20;"then it's like I don't care and I saw a picture of somebody wearing it and I"
29:20;29:22;"said this is a great shirt and immediately for whatever reason I was"
29:22;29:27;"like I bet Jake could rock this shirt wait I'm so sorry Ezra yeah have I"
29:27;29:31;"misunderstood the shirt this whole time I thought the breaking news is I don't"
29:31;29:36;"care yeah yeah no that's what I'm saying oh I thought you okay I thought you're"
29:36;29:39;"saying there's I'm just saying it's a fake out in the sense that the breaking"
29:39;29:42;"news is really official it's like breaking news didn't end it like and"
29:42;29:47;"then it's like okay I don't care yeah that is the breaking news that I don't"
29:47;29:50;"care I think you can interpret the shirt either way it essentially means the same"
29:50;29:55;"thing but I don't care about your breaking news and also breaking news I"
29:55;29:59;"don't care I just don't care about anything so anyway it's not even Jake's"
29:59;30:03;"not you're not even a cantankerous guy at all well but I also feel like I just"
30:03;30:07;"felt like a good shirt for you why just feel like a little backstory for the"
30:07;30:12;"listeners I feel like on the TC text thread every now and then though someone"
30:12;30:17;"will post like a funny shirt yeah and it'll be like could any of you guys rock"
30:17;30:22;"this right like we've definitely riffed on the idea of like wearing like a"
30:22;30:27;"really like aggro like terrible t-shirt in like a like a hip coffee shop in LA"
30:27;30:31;"yeah that's become a that's been like a running joke for years if for some"
30:31;30:34;"reason it's me yeah it's always Jake wearing just like a weird algorithmic"
30:34;30:42;"aggro internet shirt just to like a very hip LA coffee shop yeah and so I tracked"
30:42;30:46;"it down there's a lot of versions of this but I think I found the best one"
30:46;30:51;"for you got it to Jake and you know three or four days and then today you"
30:51;30:55;"took it on the road award all day breaking news I don't care"
30:55;31:02;"I wore to the south I wore to the South Pasadena dog park where it drew no"
31:02;31:06;"glances well you don't know that but no no con yeah people in the dog park are"
31:06;31:11;"you know free spirits people there with their dogs you know they understand yeah"
31:11;31:18;"they don't care either yeah and then I was driving with my dog Al to the down"
31:18;31:23;"to the studio to work for the day and I stopped in at cafe de leche on York"
31:23;31:28;"Boulevard in Highland Park now there's three coffee shops on York yeah there's"
31:28;31:34;"collage there's cafe de leche in there's kumquat now cafe de leche is definitely"
31:34;31:39;"the oldest and like least hip of these three coffee shops like more like a nine"
31:39;31:43;"I think it's been around for like it's been over like 20 years it's definitely"
31:43;31:48;"like one of the first businesses that's still standing to open on York as it"
31:48;31:52;"sort of transitioned into the kind of the gentrified era right I imagine it's"
31:52;31:56;"it's not slick it's not slick and there's not really a line ever collage"
31:56;32:01;"and kumquat especially kumquat really blows up and I've only been to kumquat"
32:01;32:08;"once which is an insane name for a coffee shop and it was like the kind of"
32:08;32:13;"thing where I got the cold brew at kumquat and was like too strong yeah"
32:13;32:16;"like I drank a quarter of it and I was just like I'm gonna like if I drink the"
32:16;32:20;"rest of this I'm gonna like out like a marble cuz I'm gonna be so dehydrated"
32:20;32:28;"like I'm gonna like go into cardiac arrest I like this guy this is all part"
32:28;32:32;"the fantasy of the guy wearing the breaking news I don't care but also"
32:32;32:41;"complains that his coffee's too strong right he's like this angry dude loves to"
32:41;32:45;"complain but also is like I don't care coffee's a little strong you walked into"
32:45;32:50;"like the hippest coffee shop in his neighborhood got the cold brew came back"
32:50;32:55;"cut the line was just like what the fuck is this I just want a nice iced coffee I"
32:55;33:00;"hate this whole vibe everything here sucks I paid seven dollars for this"
33:00;33:04;"bullshit I can't even finish it and like the person behind the barista is just"
33:04;33:10;"like sir I based on your shirt I never thought you'd react like this you seem"
33:10;33:14;"like a guy just doesn't give a fuck but clearly anybody who wears a shirt"
33:14;33:20;"advertising that they don't care might care"
33:21;33:32;"you look stupid and wow with you you look you look dumb with you I got a"
33:32;33:39;"million trillion things I'd rather do then to be with you little stupid and I"
33:39;33:45;"don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck I don't I don't give a fuck look I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do"
33:45;33:50;"I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do I heard you got a new man I see you taking the pink"
33:50;33:55;"then you post it up thinking that it's making me sick I see you calling I'll be"
33:55;34:00;"making the quick I'm an answer that shit like I don't with you I got no feelings"
34:00;34:02;"to go I swear I had it up to here I got no"
34:02;34:07;"feelings to go I mean for real how you feel it's too sensitive and going towards"
34:07;34:11;"the bill yeah and every day I wake up celebrating why cuz I just asked the"
34:11;34:15;"bullet from a crazy person I stuck to my guns that's what made me rich that's"
34:15;34:18;"what put me on that's what got me here that's what made me this and everything"
34:18;34:22;"that I do is my first me I cheese chase bread all day if she got a bird brain"
34:22;34:26;"ain't nothing but trilling me oh man silly me I just bought a crib three"
34:26;34:30;"stories that the trilogy and you know I'm rolling with this nothing Oh I got a"
34:30;34:33;"bitch that takes me she ain't got no clothes on and then another one takes"
34:33;34:39;"me yo next and I'm a take your back like I don't with you so anyway I went into"
34:39;34:46;"Cavendish a which still requires masks so I was rocking my camo mask we hit why"
34:46;34:51;"do you have a camo mask I don't know I just ended up with it somehow and I like"
34:51;34:56;"the fit of it okay but I didn't read yeah it's like a cool combo the camo"
34:56;35:01;"mask with the I don't put the breaking news I don't care wearing a campbell"
35:01;35:08;"mask gonna get the cold brew um got the cold brew from Cavendish a didn't really"
35:08;35:13;"again the shirt I think we're like maybe overestimating its power it's it's"
35:13;35:17;"pretty pretty innocuous but no and by the way we're just getting started"
35:17;35:21;"because this shirt is very subtle most people probably wouldn't even see what"
35:21;35:24;"it says and even if they read it they might not even think you're that aggro"
35:24;35:29;"but we're gonna work you up week by week with slightly more aggro shirts"
35:29;35:36;"culminating with a shirt Seinfeld found which is as you I'm not gonna wear that"
35:36;35:40;"no you got it you got it you got to put the baby in the stroller roll the kumquat"
35:40;35:47;"in the future that's the final test I can't do it it reminds me that that"
35:47;35:50;"reminds me I was like I remember like a really funny memory of like being at"
35:50;35:55;"this like you know friendlies restaurant it's like an East Coast yeah they have"
35:55;35:58;"ice cream I remember being in a friendlies with my grandmother and my"
35:58;36:02;"brother when we were like teenagers and this dude in the booth next to us was"
36:02;36:10;"wearing a baseball hat that said oh yeah it's an old school and like my brother"
36:10;36:14;"and I were laughing so hard and my grandmother was like basically legally"
36:14;36:19;"blind and I couldn't see the hat she's like what are you boys laughing at so hard"
36:19;36:25;"anyway so I'm in Cafe de Leche and I ordered the iced coffee I get no reaction"
36:25;36:29;"from my shirt I'm kind of bummed I turn around I'm leaving and I see there's an"
36:29;36:33;"older gentleman in line behind me wearing a shirt that says your screen"
36:33;36:43;"place sucks and so I was upstage I was upstaged well you told us that on the"
36:43;36:50;"thread I've been thinking about it two crazy shirts in this one's in Kevin I"
36:50;36:56;"mean to roll up to a Los Angeles coffee shop wearing your screenplay sucks shirt"
36:56;37:04;"is so aggressive it's so mean and aggressive cuz like it's also like is"
37:04;37:09;"that guy it's like said like 55 year old guy like is he like a failed screenwriter"
37:09;37:14;"is he a successful screenwriter is he just like it go either way contractor is"
37:14;37:18;"he just like a forklift operator who just like can't believe how many lame"
37:18;37:22;"people move to LA maybe he's a born and raised Angelino forklift operator and"
37:22;37:27;"he's just like I hate what this town's become man every time I go to get a"
37:27;37:32;"coffee I have to look at these losers right in their screenplays and then he's"
37:32;37:35;"like where's the shirt for me and he found it so yeah he's way more"
37:35;37:40;"aggressive although I would say if you guys had a face off your shirt Trump's"
37:40;37:45;"his because he would look at you and his shirt would say to you your screenplay"
37:45;37:50;"sucks and then you would look at him and say breaking news I don't care so you"
37:50;37:57;"actually beat him logically speaking they were nihilists breaking news yeah"
37:57;38:02;"I feel like your shirt the breaking news could be interpreted also as like satire"
38:02;38:07;"of like the current cable news world where I don't know if you guys remember"
38:07;38:13;"but like in the 90s you know CNN would reserve breaking news for like you'd see"
38:13;38:17;"it like once a week and now if you watch it's like breaking news like every every"
38:17;38:21;"hour it's like they'll break news on a story they're already reporting on it's"
38:21;38:25;"just like it's lost all all value so I feel like breaking news there's a story"
38:25;38:29;"developing in Los Angeles it seems two men with very powerful t-shirts are"
38:29;38:33;"engaged in the type of Mexican standoff at a local coffee shop one has been"
38:33;38:37;"identified as Jake Longstreet American Painter and radio American Painter radio"
38:37;38:43;"personality Jake Longstreet and tick-tock personality I think it's good"
38:43;38:45;"we got the ball rolling with this shirt I feel like Seinfeld maybe you could"
38:45;38:50;"work on this I think we could do a slightly more personalized one version"
38:50;38:54;"that's maybe a little more in like Jake's voice and maybe is a little more"
38:54;38:58;"eye-catching that's maybe some like breaking news I don't give a s***"
38:58;39:02;"oh I thought you're gonna say breaking news your script sucks oh we could"
39:02;39:08;"combine them breaking news f*** you oh breaking news the first podcast was"
39:08;39:15;"Grateful Dead's R.S. Speed. Part of why I was thinking about this is that I"
39:15;39:22;"was in a Whole Foods in New Jersey last week that really felt good just being in"
39:22;39:26;"a Whole Foods in Jersey that's tight and there was a dude walking around wearing"
39:26;39:31;"a t-shirt that said something along the lines of like basically like I'm not"
39:31;39:37;"always an a***** dot dot dot just kidding f*** you it definitely said f*** you on the"
39:37;39:41;"bottom damn everybody's wearing masks so I couldn't like totally get a read on"
39:41;39:45;"this guy's vibe but I was thinking like that's pretty aggressive to actually"
39:45;39:50;"have a f*** you I respected it in the Whole Foods is funny but there's so many"
39:50;39:53;"variations I feel like back in the day there used to be like one or two just"
39:53;40:00;"like shirts that telegraph some sort of like disgust with humanity but now"
40:00;40:04;"there's so many I can't deal with the F you on the shirt it's just like like"
40:04;40:08;"Seinfeld had sent to the thread just a shirt it was just gray shirt with black"
40:08;40:13;"text all caps and syrup it just said F you I was like what is that's not a"
40:13;40:17;"shirt no that's but that's where it's heading that's that's not clever it's"
40:17;40:22;"that's the final frontier oh my god I mean it's like the band like like there"
40:22;40:26;"was a band called F right by which you mean f*** yeah you know but like they bleep"
40:26;40:30;"out the swears on this internet radio program right okay yeah when Jake says F"
40:30;40:36;"he means f*** yeah there was a band called F and it's just like where's the poetry"
40:36;40:39;"there so I'm not there's no way of wearing a shirt that does but I'm saying"
40:39;40:44;"I think there's visual poetry if you got your dog your little baby daughter in a"
40:44;40:49;"stroller and you're wearing the f*** you shirt when I see that tableau I'm"
40:49;40:55;"intrigued I say this is an enigma this is a good man taking care of a small dog"
40:55;40:59;"and a small person and yet he wears this mysterious f*** you shirt who is he"
40:59;41:04;"saying f*** you to he seems like a good dude I'm fascinated I want to know this"
41:04;41:07;"guy that's art"
41:07;41:12;"look inside your tiny mind and look a bit harder"
41:12;41:20;"cuz we're so uninspired so sick and tired of all the hatred you harbor"
41:20;41:28;"so you say it's not okay to be gay well I think you're just evil you're just"
41:28;41:35;"some racist who can't tie my laces your point of view is medieval"
41:35;42:03;"I hate what you do and we hate your whole crew so please stop staying tight. Cue, cue, you're very, very much. Cuz your words don't translate and it's getting quite late
so please stop staying tight."
42:04;42:09;"I found a few dig that maybe you'd be interested in that these are a little"
42:09;42:14;"bit in between this these are both black t-shirts with just white text like no"
42:14;42:22;"visual poetry one is rough this one is it's not that I don't like you dot dot"
42:22;42:31;"dot oh wait yes yes it is okay here's another one I'm an a** if you don't want"
42:31;42:39;"your feelings hurt don't talk to me oh my god can I get the cold brew um just a"
42:39;42:44;"little dash of oat milk a little simple syrup this could be another one I like"
42:44;42:48;"nowadays with like COVID they like if you like you like pay with the card and"
42:48;42:51;"then they like turn the screen and like would you like to add a tip for the"
42:51;43:01;"staff nope read the shirt breaking news I don't tip oh man a simple one that"
43:01;43:06;"just says don't talk to me big big white letters on a black shirt and then we"
43:06;43:11;"send you out for a day in LA to you know Home Depot the garden supply store"
43:11;43:15;"hipster coffee shop and you just gotta you got to talk to as many people as you"
43:15;43:21;"can that sounds miserable sparks fly so guys I think one of the reasons I've"
43:21;43:26;"been so into this thread is that uh because I only basically wear shirts now"
43:26;43:32;"that are playing tees I know I don't really wear I like icon shirt graphic"
43:32;43:36;"shirts and one of the graphic shirts and one of the reasons is is when I was in"
43:36;43:44;"college in New York at Columbia I found this one downtown that on the front"
43:44;43:51;"said wine me dying me 69 with like six exclamation points and then on the back"
43:51;43:58;"said avoid hangovers stay drunk and I just thought it was so funny and it was"
43:58;44:01;"like the most offensive shirt I'd ever seen and so I like kept in my closet and"
44:01;44:07;"finally I was like I'm gonna wear this out one day and I did and to Nussbaum"
44:07;44:13;"and woo if you remember that oh yeah and I got a late night yeah big old spot"
44:13;44:17;"uptown and I and I wore it out and I the first person I ran into was my favorite"
44:17;44:23;"professor and his family like he's like 13 year old daughter and I was wearing"
44:23;44:27;"this shirt and I never really worn a shirt that said wine and died me 69 me"
44:27;44:36;"and then when I had to leave he just did avoid a stay drunk and like honestly"
44:36;44:42;"since then I was so embarrassed I've never worn a graphic tee since and so"
44:42;44:48;"the idea that you let your shirt speak for you is so funny to me and it's the"
44:48;44:51;"idea of Jake sort of and I think this might lead into what we're gonna talk"
44:51;44:56;"about next which is this idea of like a sort of dad prank show where we sort of"
44:56;45:00;"test each other in this well yeah I want to I want to get into that because we"
45:00;45:04;"were I mean there's probably even some listeners now hearing us talk about this"
45:04;45:08;"they're just like yeah what's the big deal just wear the shirt but we were"
45:08;45:12;"kind of talking about how this is almost like our version of jackass is these"
45:12;45:17;"very timid pranks that's just like yeah we're a slightly awkward shirt to a"
45:17;45:23;"coffee shop 99% odds no one gives a shit maybe 1% somebody somebody looks at is"
45:23;45:34;"like weird our vibe is kind of just like these very timid pranks that look at"
45:34;45:46;"this 45 year old loser standing in line at the coffee shop your screenplay sucks"
45:46;45:50;"is so harsh no I think you're lucky that that your screenplay sucks guy he took"
45:50;45:55;"all the the negative vibrations for that day everybody was like I f***ed that other guy"
45:55;46:00;"he's just he just doesn't care this other guy's just mean although Jake I"
46:00;46:03;"think you got to start wearing your shirt - it'll really hit I think when you"
46:03;46:08;"start going to like some like barbecues and stuff art openings yeah breaking"
46:08;46:11;"news I don't care at the art opening but we were talking about yeah these are our"
46:11;46:16;"kind of pranks and we could probably amp them up a little bit more you know if we"
46:16;46:21;"want to turn into like incredibly low stakes very low stakes but then I"
46:21;46:24;"realized I think Seinfeld you said this is kind of like our jackass then I said"
46:24;46:28;"well it's almost more like impractical jokers in the sense that it's a group of"
46:28;46:33;"friends daring each other to do just slightly awkward things not like jackass"
46:33;46:37;"or people like breaking bones and like vomiting it really is just putting"
46:37;46:42;"people in uncomfortable positions and ours is even just like so much mellower"
46:42;46:45;"and then we started thinking about what our types of pranks could be and we"
46:45;46:51;"started talking about names for the show Seinfeld had a great suggestion which I"
46:51;46:56;"still like which was practical jokers which I think technically what the f***"
46:56;46:59;"could impractical jokers do to us guys you can't be practical jokers like"
46:59;47:03;"you're in it's like literally the opposite thing and our whole thing will"
47:03;47:07;"just be like very reasonable pranks and then we were trying to take it a little"
47:07;47:12;"further away and we're looking up synonyms for jokers and I found jesters"
47:12;47:17;"jester is a very funny word in any context other than like a medieval court"
47:17;47:21;"to like refer to a person as a jester it's just like a hilarious word in a"
47:21;47:25;"modern context so as we were kind of coming up with this idea and at some"
47:25;47:30;"point it became kind of like a kind vibe low stakes prank show collectively we"
47:30;47:35;"came up with I think the perfect name gentle jesters and to me this name the"
47:35;47:41;"name is so good I just think we have to do something with it gentle jesters it"
47:41;47:46;"doesn't have to be a duration I mean we could get a bunch of old hippies get the"
47:46;47:53;"Bellamy brothers to do a cameo and just like very very mellow pranks and I think"
47:53;47:57;"a lot of the pranks actually should be about brightening somebody's day I like"
47:57;48:00;"I hadn't can't believe we didn't think of this I think like one of the pranks is"
48:00;48:07;"Hornsby having to go to Bobby and it's like walk into a party and say did you"
48:07;48:11;"know that the Grateful Dead was the first you know podcast oh yeah no I'd"
48:11;48:16;"love to get Hornsby in on it we could do a super cut that's Bruce just rolling to"
48:16;48:20;"different situations just like a man on the street Billy Eichner except it's"
48:20;48:23;"Bruce Hornsby just taking his time walking through the streets of Richmond"
48:23;48:27;"Virginia just going up to people with like a microphone be like hey can I ask"
48:27;48:30;"you a question people like are you Bruce Hornsby said yeah don't worry about it"
48:30;48:35;"did you know that the first podcast was a Grateful Dead song and then just like"
48:35;48:43;"the people like uh no I didn't and then it's gentle just general jesters"
48:43;48:50;"he turned 35 last Sunday and his hair he found some gray"
48:50;49:00;"but he still ain't changed his lifestyle he likes it better the old way"
49:00;49:07;"so he grows a little garden in the backyard by the fence he's consuming"
49:07;49:12;"what he's growing nowadays in self-defense he gets out there in the"
49:12;49:16;"Twilight Zone sometimes when it just don't make no sense"
49:16;49:21;"one of my ideas was that we this would be like an impractical jokers type thing"
49:21;49:27;"is that we make Jake work at Cafe de Leche or some kind of coffee shop and we"
49:27;49:33;"get some spy cams in there people walk in and we're blasting Neil Young on the"
49:33;49:38;"speakers and every time somebody walks up to the cash register Jake goes how"
49:38;49:43;"are you doing man and points the speaker goes Bob Dylan gotta love him and it's"
49:43;49:49;"like obviously Neil Young gentle jesters old man take a look at my life"
49:49;49:56;"Bobby D man oh man Bob after his motorcycle accident at the average like"
49:56;50:00;"vaguely hip coffee shop you'd probably get corrected so much or just thought of"
50:00;50:05;"people being like no this is Neil Young man I think I'm pretty sure it's Bob"
50:05;50:10;"pretty sure it's Bob it's incredibly slow can I pitch one yeah this is like a"
50:10;50:16;"real minimal one you know those cans the classic sort of like can of Pringles"
50:16;50:20;"can or whatever you open it up and like the snake thing like goes flying out"
50:20;50:25;"yeah okay so you're at a party no I mean maybe not a party you're in a social"
50:25;50:29;"situation and you have like a can of like almonds and it says like whatever"
50:29;50:33;"like blue diamond almonds and you're like hey you want some almonds but then"
50:33;50:39;"when the person opens it up it's cashews that is pretty sick I like that"
50:39;50:43;"that's gentle and it uplifts their day right cuz cashew is sort of like a"
50:43;50:50;"higher yeah I think we could be very cameo heavy just get like some like some"
50:50;50:56;"ogs like some of the 60s survivor types go to a steak restaurant and Van"
50:56;51:01;"Morrison's the waiter I was just picturing Bruce Springsteen's working"
51:01;51:08;"behind the counter at Cappadilly and like the bit is just sort of like yeah"
51:08;51:11;"it's sort of like how many people whether it's Van Morrison or Bruce"
51:11;51:16;"Springsteen how many people are like are you Bruce then Morrison is very few"
51:16;51:20;"people would recognize Van Morrison get recognized a lot yeah yeah people like"
51:20;51:26;"is that are you Bruce Springsteen and he's just like yes gentle gestures I"
51:26;51:30;"know you want to know saying I think that the bit for him is that Bruce"
51:30;51:35;"Springsteen's working there and they're playing Bruce Bruce and he's like I love"
51:35;51:47;"Bob Dylan that's very gestures I love I can't do a Bruce impression yeah and"
51:47;51:52;"then our segue the general nice mocha then and it's just really short the jet"
51:52;51:57;"and then the gentle gestures logo flashes on there's some wind chimes and"
51:57;52:03;"gentle gestures you know what I love about this is I feel like um you know a"
52:03;52:07;"lot of people would get involved because I you know I imagine that a lot of"
52:07;52:11;"people probably passed on punked because it was too mean or like oh yeah oh I"
52:11;52:15;"don't want to make that sure it was horrible to scaring the shadow people"
52:15;52:22;"stressing them out where Brad Pitt got kidnapped and thrown into the van that"
52:22;52:28;"was the most such like so memorable oh yeah no but punk they would really they'd"
52:28;52:34;"make like ludicrous think his house burned down that was like punked I"
52:34;52:38;"wonder if Bruce would even be down like if we could like get a line to Bruce and"
52:38;52:44;"just be like this is a real show it's gonna be on Netflix your buddy Barack"
52:44;52:48;"Obama already has a deal with Netflix so let's like let's hook it up and like you"
52:48;52:52;"just come to this coffee shop in this like mellow part of LA and you work by"
52:52;52:56;"in the counter and we roll the tape for an hour and see what happens"
52:56;53:04;"we have an hour of footage of Van Morrison working at antennas at antennas"
53:04;53:10;"nobody recognized him we made sure he gave out he brought some he gave some"
53:10;53:16;"free dessert to a lot of the patrons he was very reluctant to do that but he did"
53:16;53:21;"do it it was very gentle you know van put out a full-length record after we"
53:21;53:27;"did his a deep dive on his kovat songs did we listen to why are you on Facebook"
53:27;53:32;"on the show yes I think we did did we Matt I think we listened to the other"
53:32;53:36;"the lockdown songs okay we got to throw on wait can we why are you on Facebook"
53:36;53:43;"yeah why honestly the van was good I think friend of the show Stephen Hayden"
53:43;53:50;"wrote a review of it I was like this kind of like basically this sounds very"
53:50;53:56;"good van is like on point vocally yep and like the tones are sweet and like"
53:56;54:00;"the songs are fine and like the lyrics are just completely out there but"
54:00;54:03;"actually I was I remember I listened to why you're on Facebook and it's like"
54:03;54:07;"kind of a good song I mean it's like kind of like a it's a great question"
54:07;54:12;"this is probably the best song that he he's dropped so far probably best on"
54:12;54:16;"he's put out in the in like the 21st century although I don't know his deep"
54:16;54:20;"catalog 21st"
54:20;54:34;"why do you need second-hand friends why do you really care who's trending"
54:34;54:43;"or is this something you're defending do the light is it that empty and sad"
54:43;54:51;"all right you have to something you can't have you kiss the girls and run"
54:51;54:59;"away now you won't come at the play"
54:59;55:01;"Oh"
55:01;55:12;"great question man the song is a bit of a t-shirt itself totally couldn't you"
55:12;55:20;"see that I mean this song is breaking news right if I've ever heard one that"
55:20;55:25;"be cool elite elite period Ben Morrison album called breaking news I don't care"
55:29;55:41;"some kind of twist the game put yourself in the frame what's up people work very"
55:41;55:49;"hard to attain or are you looking for a scapegoat the blame is your opinion"
55:49;55:57;"again why are you on Facebook why are you on Facebook why are you on Facebook"
55:57;56:03;"I mean it's just a good song yeah it's like this rules either you're into the"
56:03;56:07;"lyrics are you not but it's a good song"
56:07;56:15;"oh yeah"
56:17;56:23;"nice organ solo beautiful"
56:23;56:31;"well the funny thing is this is really addressed to Vans like his generation"
56:31;56:35;"people his age you know right his generation yeah like I'm sure a lot of"
56:35;56:39;"people instinctually just write this off as like oh just a cranky old anti guy"
56:39;56:44;"being anti technology doesn't like what the kids are doing but no he's actually"
56:44;56:48;"probably looking at people his own age and just being like man what are you on"
56:48;56:55;"Facebook right come on dude you've been alive for 60 or 70 years and this is"
56:55;56:58;"what you're doing all day all the shit we've seen in our lifetimes and you're"
56:58;57:03;"frittering the day away getting in fights on Facebook Facebook sucks I"
57:03;57:09;"mean I'm fully with Van on this there could be a gentle gestures segment where"
57:09;57:13;"we just do man on the street with like a pair of headphones and just grab random"
57:13;57:16;"boomers and say have you heard the new Van Morrison song and just film them"
57:16;57:23;"listening to it oh check it out it's be like oh whoa okay"
57:23;57:36;"what do you think the reaction of a like a van van first concert out of quarantine"
57:36;57:40;"they're out there they're so psyched and he plays why are you on face why are you"
57:40;57:47;"on Facebook opener yeah pretty tight actually I mean a strong choice and"
57:47;57:51;"what's the album called it's called latest record project volume one I mean"
57:51;57:55;"maybe Vans like just rediscovering his sense of humor that's like Kanye style"
57:55;58:01;"that's it yeah that was just the file on his computer on his like producers"
58:01;58:07;"computer then what do you want to call the album I don't know man latest"
58:07;58:13;"recording project volume one why are you on Facebook I mean it's like honestly"
58:13;58:18;"so it's tight people get mad when artists like don't reconnect with like"
58:18;58:22;"the the vibe of their early work people want that look at Vanny's delivering"
58:22;58:30;"back to basics dude the funny thing is is that if if the lyrics were a little"
58:30;58:34;"harder to pin down or more mysterious or whatever I bet he could this album could"
58:34;58:40;"be seen as like might have been received like the last Bob Dylan album just like"
58:40;58:45;"a beautiful returning that early simplicity of his best work you know"
58:45;58:50;"right and just delivers like some real wisdom over the course of his 70 plus"
58:50;58:57;"years and yeah like if he is delivering wisdom I know I know it's just you know"
58:57;59:03;"it's not what the people want to hear yeah it's not what the intelligence is"
59:03;59:07;"looking for if the lyrics to this had been some kind of like recontextualized"
59:07;59:12;"nostalgic version of brown-eyed girl through the lens of like you know the"
59:12;59:16;"ups and downs of a long life people would be like absolutely beautiful like"
59:16;59:22;"yeah he's just keeping it too real very banal very real yeah I wonder what the"
59:22;59:27;"Van Morrison fan communities reaction to this is that beds is like a love-hate"
59:27;59:31;"thing yeah but I'm sure some people fuck with it I'm sure some people love it I"
59:31;59:38;"love it love anyway if anybody has any I feel like we're missing an element for"
59:38;59:44;"gentle gestures right now it exists in kind of like a art project vibe like"
59:44;59:48;"very slow and vibey but if anybody has any ideas for some kind vibe pranks that"
59:48;59:52;"brighten people's days that could be pulled off by a crew of kind of old"
59:52;59:58;"hippies gray ponytails let us know because I'd love to get gentle gestures"
59:58;01:00:03;"off the ground it could be big on tick-tock also if you're an old hippie"
01:00:03;01:00:09;"you dress like a hippie you look old and you enjoy doing gentle pranks hit us up"
01:00:09;01:00:13;"because we're casting do you think of Van Morrison worked like an eight-hour"
01:00:13;01:00:19;"shift at a coffee shop in in Silver Lake or Highland Park you'd get recognized"
01:00:19;01:00:25;"it's a great question I mean it's so on it's so inconceivable that that Ben"
01:00:25;01:00:29;"Morrison would be working at a coffee shop so even if someone did recognize"
01:00:29;01:00:33;"him they'd be like that guy looks like Van Morrison there's no way that's me"
01:00:33;01:00:38;"what if they hear his Irish accent right Vance talking to his manager and it's"
01:00:38;01:00:43;"like all right man so this is a new show called gentle gestures it pays scale"
01:00:43;01:00:48;"basically you got to fly out to LA for three days and basically the premise"
01:00:48;01:00:52;"that the producer worked up they want you to work for eight hours at a coffee"
01:00:52;01:00:57;"shop and see if anybody recognizes you they're kind of just curious it's in"
01:00:57;01:01:03;"this neighborhood Highland Park fans it's like all right I'll do it"
01:01:03;01:01:09;"you can take all the tea in China"
01:01:09;01:01:16;"put it in a big brown bag for me"
01:01:17;01:01:23;"sail right round all the seven oceans"
01:01:23;01:01:29;"drop it straight into the deep blue sea"
01:01:29;01:01:37;"she's as sweet as a triple oh honey"
01:01:37;01:01:43;"she's an angel of the first degree"
01:01:43;01:01:51;"she's as sweet as a triple oh honey"
01:01:51;01:01:56;"just like honey babe from the deep blue sea"
01:01:56;01:02:01;"wait but Jake one last thing about the merch I sent one to the thread that I think is right on the line of"
01:02:01;01:02:06;"wearable and it's a parody Taco Bell sweatshirt except instead of saying"
01:02:06;01:02:13;"Taco Bell it says go to hell would you rock that one I would yes would prefer"
01:02:13;01:02:18;"t-shirt okay I'll find a t-shirt yeah I don't want to do full hoodie that on a"
01:02:18;01:02:27;"hoodie seems weirder I mean it's more of a commitment yeah taking up more space"
01:02:27;01:02:34;"in the drawer valuable drawer space you're willing to wear a go-to-hell"
01:02:34;01:02:39;"t-shirt at the coffee shop in the dog park and I'm willing to wear yeah a"
01:02:39;01:02:45;"Taco Bell parody go to hell say no more I'm not gonna wear an F you fair enough"
01:02:45;01:02:51;"that rides the line all right Seinfeld you're gonna get the you t-shirt Jake's"
01:02:51;01:02:57;"getting the go to hell wait I gotta wear the view yeah to work oh no that's gonna"
01:02:57;01:03:02;"be I mean that's career suicide I don't think that's gonna fly can wear a"

01:03:56;01:04:01;"like I can't even imagine how mortifying it would have been like it's messed up"
01:04:01;01:04:05;"I'm glad that he's getting a second act you know you gotta send him a breaking"
01:04:05;01:04:08;"news I don't care shirt to be like there's only one way to live in this"

01:04:21;01:04:24;"a little all over the place but you know we're getting our groove back got Jake"
01:04:24;01:04:30;"back in the fold well Jake I think you told us that a while back a fan reached"
01:04:30;01:04:34;"out and asked us if we knew about the Jonathan Richmond Grateful Dead"
01:04:34;01:04:40;"connection do you remember any of this right so yes there's like a rumor that"
01:04:40;01:04:47;"he played his like first show opening for the Velvets who were opening for the"
01:04:47;01:04:52;"dead in like Massachusetts exactly in Worcester, Mass. So this was like on a"
01:04:52;01:04:57;"Grateful Dead forum or some but some kind of forum on the internet seven"
01:04:57;01:05:01;"years ago somebody said Jonathan Richmond's first live gig was opening"
01:05:01;01:05:04;"for the Velvet Underground in the Grateful Dead in Worcester, Mass. in 69"
01:05:04;01:05:10;"or 70 but there doesn't seem to be any pictures nobody recorded the show no"
01:05:10;01:05:15;"tangible evidence. It's a ghost show it's like the Zeppelin show in Maryland. Right did it"
01:05:15;01:05:18;"actually happen? There's no cooperation. And then people started like talking"
01:05:18;01:05:25;"about it and people seem to back up that it could have happened. In 69 or 70? Yes"
01:05:25;01:05:29;"Sterling Morrison of the Velvet Underground said that somebody else was"
01:05:29;01:05:33;"supposed to open and didn't show up and then the Velvets suggested that their"
01:05:33;01:05:37;"friend and major fan Jonathan Richmond could fill the spot and then Jonathan"
01:05:37;01:05:42;"played four or five songs in front of a befuddled audience. And how old was he at"
01:05:42;01:05:47;"that point like 17 or 18? I guess he could have been or a little older or a"
01:05:47;01:05:53;"little younger I don't know. Hold on. This is a very mythical show. He was born in"
01:05:53;01:05:59;"51 just okay anyway so he would have been yeah 18 or 19. And I do know that"
01:05:59;01:06:04;"Jonathan Richmond was a Velvet Underground superfan. I mean obviously."
01:06:04;01:06:09;"Obsessed with them his biggest inspiration. I think like yeah maybe he"
01:06:09;01:06:13;"got he moved to New York to try to meet them like so Jonathan Richmond and the"
01:06:13;01:06:17;"Velvet Underground make a lot of sense together. The weird one and we might have"
01:06:17;01:06:21;"talked about this on the show before is that there's like a whole history of"
01:06:21;01:06:25;"beef between the Velvet Underground and the Dead. Yeah I think we've touched on it."
01:06:25;01:06:28;"I think we've touched on it like if you go deep you can find some people talking"
01:06:28;01:06:32;"about like the whole history that like the Velvet Underground and the Grateful"
01:06:32;01:06:35;"Dead played multiple shows together in different parts of the country back then."
01:06:35;01:06:39;"Which is amazing. I guess it just made sense to people they were both"
01:06:39;01:06:44;"kind of like experimental bands and the truth is they really are two sides of"
01:06:44;01:06:50;"the same coin. They both jammed in a sense. Grateful Dead yeah being more you"
01:06:50;01:06:55;"know led by a guitar solo and the Velvet Underground being more like droney"
01:06:55;01:07:01;"noisy jams. But they're both into like letting things cook. But over the years"
01:07:01;01:07:03;"there were a lot of like very mean-spirited quotes from Lou Reed"
01:07:03;01:07:09;"basically being like the Dead suck. Jerry's not that good at guitar. That's"
01:07:09;01:07:13;"pretty hilarious. And there's also this kind of East Coast West Coast thing that"
01:07:13;01:07:17;"the Velvet Underground probably like we're cool we're from New York San"
01:07:17;01:07:21;"Francisco is like this like funny hippie scene we're not down with it. The Velvet"
01:07:21;01:07:25;"Underground I mean yeah it's basically like the forerunners of like punk and"
01:07:25;01:07:33;"indie. Right. Which like the Dead are not that. No. So it's like way different ethos."
01:07:33;01:07:38;"The Velvet Underground were like yeah like all the things you associate with"
01:07:38;01:07:44;"like post-modernism and indie warhol like detached ironic glib. Right. Trying"
01:07:44;01:07:48;"to like make beautiful music and they did. That's why we remember them right"
01:07:48;01:07:53;"because of their songs. Some excellent songs. Yeah I mean it's fascinating to"
01:07:53;01:07:57;"think about that like those two worlds collide like the like Velvet Underground"
01:07:57;01:08:03;"heads that in Worcester in 69 70. You know who went there for the see the"
01:08:03;01:08:08;"Velvets really more than the Dead. Right. And then vice versa. Some awkward chatting"
01:08:08;01:08:13;"backstage. Yeah. I wonder if like Jerry and them even knew that the Velvet"
01:08:13;01:08:18;"Underground had like hated on them or if he might or if he even had an opinion"
01:08:18;01:08:23;"about them. You mean at the time or like later in the 80s or 90s? Yeah like later."
01:08:23;01:08:30;"Yeah. Maybe that by that point. Oh hey man. Yeah."
01:08:30;01:08:36;"She was just five years old. There was nothing happening at all."
01:08:36;01:08:46;"Every time she puts on the radio there was nothing going down at all. Not at all."
01:08:46;01:08:53;"Then one fine morning she puts on a New York station. You know she don't believe what she heard at all."
01:08:56;01:09:02;"She started shaking to that fine fine music. You know her life was saved by rock and roll."
01:09:02;01:09:11;"Despite all the imputations you know you could just go out and dance to the rock and roll station."
01:09:11;01:09:17;"It was alright. Hey babe you know it was alright."
01:09:17;01:09:22;"Wait have I ever told my Lou Reed story on the show? I've heard it but not on the"
01:09:22;01:09:28;"show. Yeah you got to bust this out. I lived in New York in 2010 and 2011 which"
01:09:28;01:09:31;"I think we've talked about on the show a little bit. Yeah. And it was not a good"
01:09:31;01:09:35;"period of my life. Didn't like New York but there was some like funny weird"
01:09:35;01:09:40;"things in New York. So I became friends through my brother with the"
01:09:40;01:09:43;"writer Michael Azarad when I was living there. And we would like go Michael"
01:09:43;01:09:48;"Azarad wrote the Nirvana book ""Come As You Are"" and he wrote the book about the"
01:09:48;01:09:53;"American underground in the 80s ""Our Band Could Be Your Life"". So I knew I read"
01:09:53;01:09:58;"his book his Nirvana book when I was in high school. And when my brother's band"
01:09:58;01:10:02;"Dirty Projectors was sort of like gaining some buzz or you know"
01:10:02;01:10:09;"noteworthiness in New York in like you know whatever that was 2008-2009."
01:10:09;01:10:13;"Azarad was a fan and so he introduced himself to my brother and so they became"
01:10:13;01:10:16;"friendly. So when I moved to New York you know I became friends with Michael"
01:10:16;01:10:20;"because we just hang out and like drink beers and talk about rock music and we"
01:10:20;01:10:24;"would go on hikes sometimes in upstate. And he was friends with Laurie Anderson"
01:10:24;01:10:31;"who was Lou Reed's I don't know wife or life partner or whatever. And so Michael"
01:10:31;01:10:36;"was turning 50 I guess this must have been 2011 maybe and he had his 50th"
01:10:36;01:10:41;"birthday party and like Laurie was like yeah well let's I'm gonna host a dinner"
01:10:41;01:10:47;"for you at my place you know where I live with Lou Reed. And so it was a"
01:10:47;01:10:53;"pretty it was like maybe like 15 people maybe at this dinner and I go there and"
01:10:53;01:10:56;"Lou Reed's not there. And I'd asked Michael I was like are you"
01:10:56;01:11:00;"friends with Lou Reed too? Like is like you're friends with his lady? And he's"
01:11:00;01:11:03;"like no I've met him a few times but you know we have like you know I go to"
01:11:03;01:11:09;"movies with Laurie we go for walks in Central Park yada yada. So I go to the"
01:11:09;01:11:12;"dinner and then like maybe like 45 minutes into the dinner Lou Reed just"
01:11:12;01:11:16;"kind of like ambles into the apartment. And it's Lou Reed you know and it's"
01:11:16;01:11:20;"like a lot of like New York like indie rock musicians at this birthday party."
01:11:20;01:11:24;"And everyone's just sort of like well all the conversation just kind of like"
01:11:24;01:11:28;"draws to a hush you know. And everyone's just like oh yeah it's Lou Reed okay cool."
01:11:28;01:11:32;"And like he just like kind of plops down at the end of the table. And he basically"
01:11:32;01:11:36;"just showed up at the party to like eat dinner because Laurie had made like a"
01:11:36;01:11:40;"big dinner for everyone. Then he starts holding court and he started he's in the"
01:11:40;01:11:44;"middle of working on his Lou Reed Metallica album at that point. Which I think"
01:11:44;01:11:49;"might have been his final album. Yeah because he died in 2013 I think and so"
01:11:49;01:11:53;"this must have been like two years before that. So he's holding court about"
01:11:53;01:11:57;"like how like what geniuses Metallica are and yada yada. And then he starts"
01:11:57;01:12:02;"talking about the Kanye record My Dark Twisted Fantasy. Is that what it's called?"
01:12:02;01:12:06;"My Dark Twisted Fantasy? My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy yeah. I knew I was"
01:12:06;01:12:09;"forgetting a word. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. He's like oh man that"
01:12:09;01:12:13;"Kanye record's incredible. I love that record. I want to listen to that right now."
01:12:13;01:12:18;"And then I was like oh Lou you know I actually have that on my iPod. iPod? Apple"
01:12:18;01:12:23;"product. You know it's like in my it's in my pocket. And so he's like okay cool."
01:12:23;01:12:29;"So then I walk over with Lou over to the stereo and then he finds"
01:12:29;01:12:34;"like an eighth inch aux in cord. But it's not hooked up to the RCA cables in"
01:12:34;01:12:39;"the back you know. And so then it's me and Lou and like there's an entire table"
01:12:39;01:12:44;"like a party of like 12 other 13 other people who for some reason like this has"
01:12:44;01:12:47;"like stopped all conversation in the party. And they're all like kind of like"
01:12:47;01:12:52;"looking at us and we're both like kind of like leaning over the back into the"
01:12:52;01:12:56;"stereo trying to find the RCA input for this aux cord to hook up so I can play"
01:12:56;01:13:01;"the Kanye song he wants to hear. And we're both showing just full-on like"
01:13:01;01:13:09;"plumber's crack. Just like a good like three quarters to an inch just top of"
01:13:09;01:13:14;"ass crack of Jake Longstreet and Lou Reed. Tell me somebody got a picture. No this is"
01:13:14;01:13:19;"ephemeral. Damn. This is just this is just for the history book. Maybe somebody's"
01:13:19;01:13:24;"got a story you've ever told. And then like the dinner was over and then like"
01:13:24;01:13:28;"Lou very abruptly is like ""Lloyd we're going to that movie right?"" And she's like"
01:13:28;01:13:33;"""Yeah."" And they're going to some movie and Laurie was just like ""Okay guys well"
01:13:33;01:13:38;"just lock up when you leave."" And so they left and then it was like me and Michael"
01:13:38;01:13:42;"and like six other people and we were feeling the spirit of the night and we"
01:13:42;01:13:48;"just listened to Master of Puppets at full volume for like 40 minutes. And then"
01:13:48;01:13:51;"there was this whole fantasy of like Laurie comes back at like 1 in the"
01:13:51;01:13:57;"morning with Lou and like we're still there like listening to Metallica."
01:13:57;01:14:02;"But that's my Lou Reed story. Any small talk? Did he look through your iPod? Not"
01:14:02;01:14:08;"really. He was very focused on the Kanye. The other thing is like I was I'm"
01:14:08;01:14:15;"not like a huge Lou Reed guy. Especially in 2011 I really was not. Like I've"
01:14:15;01:14:19;"grown to appreciate his work a lot more since but I really there were definitely"
01:14:19;01:14:23;"people who were. Including the Velvet Underground. You just were not. I mean I always liked the"
01:14:23;01:14:26;"Velvet. It's just not a Velvet or Lou Reed was never a band that like hit"
01:14:26;01:14:30;"hard. So you were just like sitting there with him just like ""Hey Lou you know I"
01:14:30;01:14:33;"read that you did shows with the Grateful Dead before. That's awesome. I'm"
01:14:33;01:14:37;"a huge fan of them."" Yeah Lou it's so funny that you guys were both called the"
01:14:37;01:14:41;"Warlocks. I mean what are the odds? I mean also you know there's an early version"
01:14:41;01:14:45;"of ZZ Top called the Warlocks. Why were there so many bands called the Warlocks?"
01:14:45;01:14:50;"Is that like a male witch? Yeah. Yeah I mean there were definitely people at that"
01:14:50;01:14:53;"party who were like completely quaking in their boots because they were in the"
01:14:53;01:14:58;"same room as Lou Reed. I just was not you know if it was a Robert Pollard or"
01:14:58;01:15:04;"Jerry Garcia I might have been quaking in my boots. But you know I was sort of"
01:15:04;01:15:07;"just like yeah I know who Lou Reed is but I'm not like you know. So I wasn't"
01:15:07;01:15:12;"like losing my mind. I could tell some people were. That'd be a tight story to"
01:15:12;01:15:17;"tell it up around a campfire. It's the exact same story except instead of Lou"
01:15:17;01:15:22;"it's 2011 Michael Azarad's birthday except instead of Lou Reed walking in"
01:15:22;01:15:29;"Jerry Garcia walked in. Just zombie. You're like what? He sat down and he started"
01:15:29;01:15:32;"talking about how much he loved the new Kanye album and I said Jerry I got that"
01:15:32;01:15:37;"on my iPod. The two of us rolled over to the speakers full plumber crack"
01:15:37;01:15:42;"hanging out. I finally got it on. He left to go to a movie never saw the guy again."
01:15:42;01:15:48;"Weird. Only problem is Jerry you've been dead for 16 years. Why are you here? And"
01:15:48;01:15:54;"then he vanished. If I can make a TC call for submissions to our email"
01:15:54;01:15:59;"8minutecapecod that's the numeral 8 at gmail.com. I'd love to see some fan art"
01:15:59;01:16:04;"in tribute to the butt crack aux cord moment. No I think that could be a really"
01:16:04;01:16:10;"good picture. That'd be a great t-shirt. Yeah. Yeah. Did you figure out the"
01:16:10;01:16:16;"aux cord together? Sorry I just or did he I mean did you team up? I mean who"
01:16:16;01:16:21;"figured it out? I took charge on that. I'm not the most technologically adept person"
01:16:21;01:16:27;"but I took charge on that situation. Double plumber crack."
01:16:27;01:16:43;"up to the sky things like that drive me out of my mind I watched it for a little"
01:16:43;01:16:49;"while I like to watch things on TV"
01:16:49;01:17:07;"satellite of love satellite of love satellite of love satellite of love"
01:17:07;01:17:12;"at some point well I guess we should go deep on Jonathan Richman but just real"
01:17:12;01:17:16;"quick Jake are you a Jonathan Richman fan? Yeah I am and I again I haven't gone"
01:17:16;01:17:21;"deep I mean I love like I know the big songs I don't know like deep modern"
01:17:21;01:17:25;"lovers cuts or you know but you know that summer feeling and stuff love it"
01:17:25;01:17:30;"that is a deep song cuz that's not on the first is it I mean I feel like that"
01:17:30;01:17:33;"his the first modern lovers album just kind of like dwarfs everything else that"
01:17:33;01:17:41;"has like Roadrunner yeah Pablo Picasso there's some amazing clips of him like"
01:17:41;01:17:46;"playing like on TV shows in the 70s oh yeah he's a great performer which and"
01:17:46;01:17:49;"a great songwriter you know it's crazy too like he like I remember like a few"
01:17:49;01:17:53;"years ago he played at the bootleg theater which actually just I just heard"
01:17:53;01:17:57;"just closed because of COVID which is a bummer but that was like you know like a"
01:17:57;01:18:03;"maybe 300 cap like all ages club that like Richard Pictures might have played"
01:18:03;01:18:08;"at he would play like weird small venues like he seems like the type of dude who"
01:18:08;01:18:13;"though could like randomly be like really big in like France Portugal oh"
01:18:13;01:18:18;"yeah beloved figure Jonathan Richman are you a big fan I mean it seems like you"
01:18:18;01:18:23;"would be a big fan yeah I love that first album and and growing up my friend"
01:18:23;01:18:27;"Andre who put me on to a lot of music we both had this phase around the same time"
01:18:27;01:18:33;"we're both like hyper interested in punk but particularly like early punk and"
01:18:33;01:18:37;"like New York punk in the history of it so Jonathan Richman is this kind of like"
01:18:37;01:18:41;"adjacent figure to that because the modern lovers first record came out pre"
01:18:41;01:18:46;"punk and you know Jerry Harrison who became a member of the talking heads was"
01:18:46;01:18:51;"in the band so they're like all these like cool connections and I think the"
01:18:51;01:18:55;"Sex Pistols covered Roadrunner and and so I really got into that album and and"
01:18:55;01:19:00;"that album is just so um just truly nothing like it you know Roadrunner is"
01:19:00;01:19:04;"cool it's like it's his rock and roll song but I always like these other songs"
01:19:04;01:19:08;"like the weird sad ones like there's this ballad called the hospital that"
01:19:08;01:19:17;"just goes like when you get out of the hospital please let me back into your"
01:19:17;01:19:24;"life actually like the tone of that I feel like is so like 90s indie like it"
01:19:24;01:19:28;"really presaged a lot of things that was a great impression by the way oh thank"
01:19:28;01:19:32;"you I listen I've listened to it many times in my life he's just like a very"
01:19:32;01:19:36;"idiosyncratic dude and and I always liked um he had like this this weird"
01:19:36;01:19:40;"kind of like conservatism you know because like a lot of his songs were"
01:19:40;01:19:45;"about like missing the old days and like not being into the hippies. That summer feeling."
01:19:45;01:19:49;"and yeah because you know he has that song I'm straight that's about how he"
01:19:49;01:19:53;"doesn't do drugs basically he's telling a girl like I'm straight like I don't"
01:19:53;01:19:57;"which people I guess used to say to me not that you're you're heterosexual but"
01:19:57;01:20:02;"that you don't partake. Straight edge. Straight edge. Right. And it was basically"
01:20:02;01:20:06;"about how like he wanted to take the place of like the the stoner dude this"
01:20:06;01:20:10;"girl's dating like I'm straight and I want to take his place and there's a"
01:20:10;01:20:16;"part he goes I'm certainly not stoned like hippie Johnny and you get the"
01:20:16;01:20:21;"impression that he like really felt that like he really was like an earnest dude"
01:20:21;01:20:24;"who probably just like saw some like hippie Johnny dude and just like man I"
01:20:24;01:20:30;"can't believe this stoner dude getting this girl that I like man I'm straight"
01:20:30;01:20:35;"and I want to take his place so he had that kind of like not down with the"
01:20:35;01:20:38;"hippies and he had this song called the old world where he's just basically"
01:20:38;01:20:43;"talking about he still likes his parents and I still like the old world you know"
01:20:43;01:20:48;"well I mean his music is like old I mean it's very grooted in like old-fashioned"
01:20:48;01:20:52;"rock and roll like Buddy Holly or something right yeah he probably was not"
01:20:52;01:20:56;"down you know what I mean he wasn't down with a 25-minute Dark Star he wasn't"
01:20:56;01:20:59;"down with Zeppelin it means it seems like he was into like Buddy Holly and"
01:20:59;01:21:04;"like the Everly Brothers. Simple old rock and roll. Yeah the thing is he was into"
01:21:04;01:21:09;"that stuff but it wasn't just like a throwback there was like a contemporary"
01:21:09;01:21:12;"edge to him. There's a social conservative edge to it we need to"
01:21:12;01:21:17;"return to the era of Buddy Holly. Yeah he'd be a good guest. Have you seen him play before?"
01:21:17;01:21:21;"I've never seen him live before. No but I've also gone down like YouTube rabbit"
01:21:21;01:21:25;"holes where he's playing like his song about the lesbian bar on like Conan O'Brien"
01:21:25;01:21:30;"in 1992 and you're just like damn he's a great performer. Yeah he really is. Man we"
01:21:30;01:21:35;"should go if he comes through and plays a club in LA TC Field Trip. Oh I"
01:21:35;01:21:38;"definitely would. Because I remember like a few years ago I was like I missed it"
01:21:38;01:21:43;"and I was like whoa wait Jonathan I think I was like at the bootleg for"
01:21:43;01:21:47;"something for a friend's band's show and I was like looking at the calendar and"
01:21:47;01:21:51;"I was like wait Jonathan Richman was here like two weeks ago like what the"
01:21:51;01:21:55;"hell? Damn no and I'm sure yeah he seems like he'd be a great person to go see I"
01:21:55;01:21:59;"bet he's probably like talking and telling stories and being funny and"
01:21:59;01:22:03;"charming. I mean maybe he we should try to get him on the show and see if he"
01:22:03;01:22:07;"actually played that show. Oh that's a good idea. All right Jonathan Richman"
01:22:07;01:22:11;"you're invited on TC. We should get Jeff Kruelick on. Who's that? The guy that did"
01:22:11;01:22:15;"heavy metal parking lot but he also did the movie about the Zeppelin show. Oh yeah"
01:22:15;01:22:21;"that's cool. I told you I interviewed him years ago. Oh yeah yeah. I think he'd be an"
01:22:21;01:22:25;"interesting guest. Yeah that's cool. He's done like I don't know I have it somewhere in"
01:22:25;01:22:28;"like my collection of like old DVDs I think you can probably find him online"
01:22:28;01:22:33;"because he he had an idea I don't know if it was like an idea for it but he"
01:22:33;01:22:37;"basically had a series right so he did heavy metal parking lot then he did Neil"
01:22:37;01:22:40;"Diamond parking lot which is definitely worth watching but then he also did"
01:22:40;01:22:45;"Harry Potter parking lot which is people waiting out like early on like capturing"
01:22:45;01:22:51;"like the Harry Potter craze. At like a bookstore? At bookstores. And he's wait out front for all of the"
01:22:51;01:22:56;"like Harry Potter heads. That's sick. And it does seem like if now you're like oh"
01:22:56;01:23:00;"that's an easy Netflix show right this is like easy you could just do this"
01:23:00;01:23:06;"forever of just like you know parking lots. Yeah parking lots like deep heads and"
01:23:06;01:23:12;"yeah he and he is I mean it's been so long but he is like he was such a nice"
01:23:12;01:23:17;"guy. I mean I just I watched the first ten minutes of heavy metal parking lot a"
01:23:17;01:23:21;"few weeks ago it's so fascinating is it's like everyone's talking they sound"
01:23:21;01:23:25;"like they're from the 60s still because it's like relatively close to the 60s"
01:23:25;01:23:30;"closer to the 60s than now. Yeah I think it's like 83 or something and it's a"
01:23:30;01:23:36;"it's a Judas Priest show in like 83. And everyone's like yeah man we're yeah"
01:23:36;01:23:40;"dude like we're here to like rock man and like. They still like earnestly"
01:23:40;01:23:43;"believed in the power of rock and roll? Oh my god yeah and like just like the"
01:23:43;01:23:47;"intonation and their voice was like it reminded me of like footage from like"
01:23:47;01:23:51;"Altamont or something which was only like you know 14 years before. Now that's"
01:23:51;01:23:56;"hilarious to think that heavy metal parking lot is 14 years past the 60s"
01:23:56;01:24:05;"that'd be like yeah us comparing now to 2007. Just like one day somebody's like"
01:24:05;01:24:09;"listening to like somebody's listening to a time crisis episode from 2021 be like"
01:24:09;01:24:14;"it's funny man they still seem like they sound like the same as people from 2007."
01:24:14;01:24:26;"I called this number three times already today but I I got scared I put it back"
01:24:26;01:24:34;"in place I put my phone back in place I still don't know if I should have called"
01:24:34;01:24:46;"up look just tell me why don't you if I'm out of place cuz here's your chance"
01:24:46;01:24:57;"to make me feel awkward and wish that I had never even called up this place I"
01:24:57;01:25:07;"saw you go today walk by with hippie Johnny I had a call up and say how I"
01:25:07;01:25:19;"wanna take his place so this phone call today concerns hippie Johnny he's always"
01:25:19;01:25:30;"stoned he's never straight I saw you today you don't walk by with hippie"

01:25:42;01:25:53;"Johnny now get this I'm straight and I want to take his place now look I like"
01:25:53;01:26:05;"him too I like hippie Johnny but I'm straight and I want to take his I said"
01:26:05;01:26:10;"I'm straight all right we've covered a lot of ground today but our top five"
01:26:10;01:26:17;"today is built around the fact that the first modern lovers album came out in 76"
01:26:17;01:26:21;"I believe it was recorded earlier but yeah it came out in 76. Yeah it took them a while to"
01:26:21;01:26:25;"put that record out cuz I mean he's been playing shows for six or seven years. I feel like it recorded"
01:26:25;01:26:29;"two or three years earlier but so we're gonna compare the top five hits of 76"
01:26:29;01:26:35;"to today but we're gonna do a speed run"
01:26:35;01:26:46;"for the top five on iTunes. The top five song in 76 Captain and Tennille shop around"
01:26:46;01:26:51;"what's this like a cover this is like a 60s song like a Motown cover yeah like"
01:26:51;01:26:55;"you better shop around right yeah"
01:27:02;01:27:06;"now from what I understand in the 70s Captain and Tennille were like the"
01:27:06;01:27:12;"epitome of like uncool I've never even heard of them they're like a big Vegas"
01:27:12;01:27:17;"act and they're like a duo and the captain wore like a captain hat and yeah"
01:27:17;01:27:24;"I feel like they were like a real staple for like Liberace time and then into the"
01:27:24;01:27:30;"80s like of and maybe you know into the 90s like as far as I know I once went"
01:27:30;01:27:36;"had a for another time this ended up in Vegas with a bunch of old people and"
01:27:36;01:27:41;"they were all very excited to see captain like night yeah big it very"
01:27:41;01:27:46;"excited and that would have been 98 so I think yeah and I think one of them died"
01:27:46;01:27:54;"like sometime in mid 2000s I mean I will say this this is very uncool like the"

01:32:25;01:32:29;"some yacht rock is very tasteful no I like some yacht rock I just I wouldn't"

01:32:38;01:32:43;"mean there are some Hall & Oates songs I would more easily categorizes yacht rock"
01:32:43;01:32:48;"but this is just like just a little too early a little too pure that's just me"
01:32:48;01:32:52;"I'm just splitting hairs for the unacquainted what are the characteristics"
01:32:52;01:32:56;"of yacht rock as you see them people haven't seen the YouTube series I think"
01:32:56;01:33:02;"when people joke about yacht rock they mean kind of like cheesy slick breezy"
01:33:02;01:33:08;"yeah white people music that's like vibe although yeah the look the thing a"
01:33:08;01:33:12;"little overproduced yeah but then the truth is like at the end of the day a"
01:33:12;01:33:17;"lot of yacht rock really is just like excellent music beloved by people of all"
01:33:17;01:33:21;"races like to me the epitome of yacht rock would be like Christopher Cross"
01:33:21;01:33:26;"sailing yeah which is actually a beautiful well-produced song I like the"
01:33:26;01:33:32;"song there is like a sad like Eileen's car kind of like hollowness it's a very"

01:34:16;01:34:24;"leave me out of comments leave me out of nonsense speaking out of context people"
01:34:24;01:34:29;"need some content trying to keep up it's not a contest whipping bands concept"

01:34:55;01:35:00;"a pleaser 42 millimeter was made in Geneva yeah I probably should go to"
01:35:00;01:35:07;"yeshiva is Drake a recent dad he's got like a four-year-old I think okay"
01:35:07;01:35:14;"famously he had a beef with the rapper push a tee who revealed that that he had"
01:35:14;01:35:19;"a child on record and it sort of won the battle so Drake had a kid that he didn't"
01:35:19;01:35:25;"reveal to the public until push a tee in the midst of a very heated sort of back"
01:35:25;01:35:31;"and forth revealed it you think history will recognize push a tee is the winner"
01:35:31;01:35:35;"of that battle that's pretty weak I mean you don't bring people's kids and stuff"
01:35:35;01:35:40;"that yeah well I you know you know the funny thing is about it is like he"
01:35:40;01:35:46;"didn't even I think in a way the fact that Drake had a kid people didn't know"
01:35:46;01:35:51;"about yeah like what is that doesn't reflect poorly on Drake and he came back"
01:35:51;01:35:56;"with like a famous line later on he said I wasn't hiding my child from the world"
01:35:56;01:36:02;"I was hiding the world from my child all right fair enough but the thing yeah"
01:36:02;01:36:07;"it's like the idea that somebody really famous like Drake would want to like"
01:36:07;01:36:13;"spare his child some of like the the nonsense of crazy people and paparazzi"
01:36:13;01:36:16;"and all that is pretty reasonable I think people gave it up for push a tee"
01:36:16;01:36:22;"just almost as like an award for excellence in research like he didn't"
01:36:22;01:36:26;"uncover he didn't uncover like something like Oh Drake I found out that you're"
01:36:26;01:36:31;"actually like a huge loser or a coward he really was just like my research team"
01:36:31;01:36:36;"is excellent and people are like yeah research it was investigative it original"
01:36:36;01:36:40;"research and actually just to add to that if you remember the the album single or"
01:36:40;01:36:45;"the single cover was also research-based it was it was a photo of Drake in"
01:36:45;01:36:50;"blackface that had not been seen oh yeah before so there were like layers of like"
01:36:50;01:36:55;"investigative reporting right true excellence in research just it almost be"
01:36:55;01:36:58;"like if he if he just like in the middle of the freestyle is just like and Drake's"
01:36:58;01:37:04;"Hulu password is and just like said it and again it's like Drake you know"
01:37:04;01:37:07;"that'd be a minor inconvenience Drake would probably change it immediately but"
01:37:07;01:37:10;"it would just get people talking just like push it he has an excellent"
01:37:10;01:37:17;"research team how did they figure that out he hired some very steadfast PIs"
01:37:17;01:37:22;"yep in order he lists all the books on Drake's nightstand from top to bottom"
01:37:22;01:37:26;"and Drake's just like wait that's just weird were you and were you in my house"
01:37:26;01:37:30;"no this is like a Chappelle's show sketch or something like right on the"
01:37:30;01:37:34;"record he's like rapping about what Drake is currently doing yeah he's like"
01:37:34;01:37:40;"listening to it like looking around he's just sending Drake hours of VHS footage"
01:37:40;01:37:44;"of the front the front of his house Drake's like come on man we're supposed"
01:37:44;01:37:48;"to be just like hurting each other's feelings this is just creepy yeah I"
01:37:48;01:37:57;"don't want to live in some Michael Hanica movie. What was that movie called Caché?"
01:37:57;01:38:03;"yeah dudes getting videotapes of his front of his house just like damn that"
01:38:03;01:38:07;"would be some next-level sh*t is like you're in you're in like a rap battle"
01:38:07;01:38:10;"with somebody and you just drop a song called Caché it's just like a song"
01:38:10;01:38:15;"that's mostly instrumental and the whole video that you drop is like from like"
01:38:15;01:38:20;"that day just like foot footage inside their house and just everyone's so every"
01:38:20;01:38:24;"like once in a while you just go Caché"
01:38:24;01:38:32;"Caché and just like it's like a slow zoom into their house like this is against the"
01:38:32;01:38:40;"rules this is just weird please stop filming me. The new single Caché from Stalker"
01:38:40;01:38:46;"the new single Caché from Stalker. All right well we'll probably hear this song"
01:38:46;01:38:50;"again go deeper I caught that Drake said he's gonna go to Yeshiva that's"
01:38:50;01:38:55;"interesting you know what a Yeshiva is Jake? What's that? No. It's like a Jewish school I think it's"

01:39:33;01:39:39;"That sounds very old-school. Yeah I mean even in 1976 this must have felt a"
01:39:39;01:39:44;"little throwback right? Yeah I mean it sounds very 60s. Oh the song was written"
01:39:44;01:39:49;"in 66. There you go. Oh yeah you're right okay I'm seeing the notes here. She"
01:39:49;01:39:55;"received a phone call from producer Tom Couch. It's a cool name. She went to the"
01:39:55;01:39:59;"studio recorded the whole song in one take."
01:40:05;01:40:11;"That one take note reminds me of did you guys watch the T-Pain episode of that"
01:40:11;01:40:19;"Netflix show about autotune or about pop music? No. It's pretty fascinating"
01:40:19;01:40:24;"friend of the show friend of Nick T-Pain talks about the depression that he felt"
01:40:24;01:40:30;"after Usher told him that he ruined music and he became sort of a laughing"
01:40:30;01:40:34;"stock of the music industry for a bit and then his comeback was pretty good."
01:40:34;01:40:40;"Wait why did Usher say that? Well the the popularity of autotune and sort of"
01:40:40;01:40:45;"dominated pop music and kind of messed things up and and there's a T-Pain tells"
01:40:45;01:40:50;"a story about Usher sort of confronting him on a plane and saying like hey man"
01:40:50;01:40:55;"you kind of you kind of messed up music by making autotune you know the"
01:40:55;01:41:00;"ubiquitous force that it became and that sent T-Pain like sort of spiraling. Oh"
01:41:00;01:41:04;"man because it's not like T-Pain was like okay I'll use this to really a"
01:41:04;01:41:10;"really extreme effect and then I will change music forever. No. He was sort of"
01:41:10;01:41:14;"like I'll do this it sounds crazy. I wasn't going for you yeah ubiquity Usher."
01:41:14;01:41:18;"You gotta believe me Usher I wasn't going for ubiquity. I'm just one man. I"
01:41:18;01:41:23;"don't have your vocal skills Usher. But he is an excellent singer. No Usher I mean"
01:41:23;01:41:27;"come on Usher doesn't need I mean you know what I'm saying. Yeah perhaps he's"
01:41:27;01:41:32;"no Usher. Usher's a natural virtuoso yeah. But the way he talks about it too I mean he"
01:41:32;01:41:36;"was getting like there was like a pile-on with the Jay-Z stuff with"
01:41:36;01:41:42;"everything you know like the Jay-Z, D.O.A. you know death of autotune and"
01:41:42;01:41:46;"everything but the way he tells the story is that he was like Usher asked to"
01:41:46;01:41:49;"see me and we're on a plane and obviously T-Pain's very popular but he's"
01:41:49;01:41:52;"also very young and when I met him he was like really young and Usher in Atlanta is"
01:41:52;01:41:58;"like this force you know he's so famous. He's been famous since the 90s. He's been"
01:41:58;01:42:02;"famous for yeah since everyone was a kid so certainly T-Pain grew up with him. He's"
01:42:02;01:42:07;"like Usher wants to see you and he was like whoa Usher wants to see me this is"
01:42:07;01:42:11;"amazing so he so even though he was like riding high he's like oh my god this guy"
01:42:11;01:42:15;"wants to see me what does he want to say maybe even like just be like oh my god"
01:42:15;01:42:19;"another like fellow in the music industry is you know on the plane he's"
01:42:19;01:42:22;"like you f***ed up music and I don't like you for it and he was like what?"
01:42:22;01:42:27;"Oh he was actually but Usher seems like such a nice guy. He does seem like a"
01:42:27;01:42:33;"kind vibe guy but I think... Was he smiling when he said it? No not it sounds or if"
01:42:33;01:42:38;"he was like... He was frowning? I think he was grimacing? Certainly it sounds like he was"
01:42:38;01:42:43;"grimacing or it sounds like he was stern when he said it basically like you did"
01:42:43;01:42:48;"this thing that makes all the way I read it or heard it and and I mean I"
01:42:48;01:42:52;"experienced I was there through part of this but you know Seinfeld tell me how"
01:42:52;01:42:56;"it sounded to you is basically he was like you've ruined music in that you've"
01:42:56;01:43:00;"let all these other people think they can do this and there's like no you"
01:43:00;01:43:04;"basically lowered the bar for artists which as you just pointed out Ezra and"
01:43:04;01:43:08;"as the Masked Singer has shown like he can actually sing like it was just"
01:43:08;01:43:12;"something he was doing because it sounds cool. I guess that wasn't Usher's"
01:43:12;01:43:17;"point maybe he was saying you and I we're both real singers what you've done"
01:43:17;01:43:23;"you've betrayed our sacred brotherhood now all sorts of idiots who can't sing"
01:43:23;01:43:26;"are gonna be doing this sh*t. Well I'm sorry to hear that about Friend of the"
