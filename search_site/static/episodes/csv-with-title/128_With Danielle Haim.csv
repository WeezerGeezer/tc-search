00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:07;00:15;"Today we're joined by Danielle Haim to talk about The Eagles, Sublime, and so much more."
00:15;00:21;"We also take a look at a track from the new Taylor Swift album."
00:21;00:27;"All this, plus a little bit of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups."
00:27;00:32;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:39;00:46;"All of those great romances, they were a fellow of me."
00:46;00:52;"All my rightful chances, my picture clear."
00:52;00:57;"Everything seemed so easy."
00:57;01:04;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go."
01:04;01:08;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:08;01:14;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:14;01:19;"Leave it only there."
01:19;01:22;"Time Crisis, back once again. What's up, Jake?"
01:22;01:24;"Not a whole lot. How are you?"
01:24;01:25;"I'm tired."
01:25;01:26;"What have you been up to?"
01:26;01:28;"I've been in the studio a little bit."
01:28;01:32;"Oh, cool. With Ariel, or you don't want to say?"
01:32;01:35;"It's been a little bit with Ariel, but yeah, a bunch of stuff."
01:35;01:38;"Me, CT, and Béa, we're doing some jamming."
01:38;01:41;"We've been figuring out good ways that we can all do this kind of stuff safely,"
01:41;01:45;"involving social distancing, testing, and things like that."
01:45;01:47;"But I guess I've always known this about myself."
01:47;01:51;"I guess this is true about everybody, but I don't want to say I'm lazy."
01:51;01:54;"Everybody says they're lazy, but as quarantine went on,"
01:54;01:58;"I just kind of realized there definitely is a part of me that could imagine"
01:58;02:02;"decades going by of just kind of not really doing anything,"
02:02;02:04;"not getting to work."
02:04;02:07;"I probably would have done a lot of jamming on the piano"
02:07;02:10;"and making a little beat or something and writing a few words here and there,"
02:10;02:15;"but I do find leaving the house to go do something for real exhausting."
02:15;02:17;"Just not used to it."
02:17;02:19;"I guess I'm sort of surprised to hear that,"
02:19;02:22;"because you are such an accomplished recording artist."
02:22;02:27;"It does seem a little unlikely that you'd be like,"
02:27;02:30;"""Oh, man, I don't want to go into the studio and work."""
02:30;02:34;"I mean, it seems like to make records like that, you'd have to work your tail off."
02:34;02:37;"I know, and there were some very extreme times in the past"
02:37;02:40;"where finishing a record was really hard."
02:40;02:42;"There's also something that's like,"
02:42;02:45;"as much as the beginning of a record should be kind of laid back,"
02:45;02:48;"for me it can also be a little bit high pressure,"
02:48;02:51;"because I've never heard the first version,"
02:51;02:55;"even a rough demo of a song where I finally put down vocals"
02:55;02:58;"and didn't at least have a millisecond of being like,"
02:58;03:00;"""Well, this song sucks."""
03:00;03:03;"And then oftentimes, right after, you start to be like,"
03:03;03:05;"""Okay, maybe there's something here,"""
03:05;03:07;"and eventually your confidence builds back up."
03:07;03:10;"But yeah, even going back to the first album,"
03:10;03:13;"I always had that feeling, first take of vocals,"
03:13;03:16;"just being like, ""Yikes, all right, sorry I even brought the song in. This sucks."""
03:16;03:19;"So I find that aspect of the process maybe a little bit draining,"
03:19;03:22;"and I'll probably chill out more once I get through some of that."
03:22;03:23;"Yeah, that makes sense."
03:23;03:26;"I think in anything, with the first tentative steps of something"
03:26;03:31;"going from an idealized dream and vague vision"
03:31;03:34;"to actual data on a file of like,"
03:34;03:36;"""This is the first actual stab,"""
03:36;03:39;"whether it's painting in a sky or throwing down a vocal,"
03:39;03:44;"it's always just like, ""You, really? This is all I got? All right."""
03:44;03:47;"Dude, I've been on a real mountain bruise kick."
03:47;03:50;"I bought Logic, which is an Apple product,"
03:50;03:51;"because I'm a company man."
03:51;03:52;"Oh, sick."
03:52;03:57;"And then I bought an Apogee One, which is a very simple audio interface,"
03:57;04:00;"analog to digital interface, and I bought a mic stand."
04:00;04:02;"And it's a preamp, yeah."
04:02;04:05;"And so I've been recording stuff on my own"
04:05;04:07;"and also working on that stuff with Mountain Brews,"
04:07;04:08;"like the Raise and Deplace stuff."
04:08;04:12;"But I just was playing some stuff for Hannah,"
04:12;04:14;"and it was just like, ""God, this is embarrassing."
04:14;04:16;"These vocals are so bad."""
04:16;04:19;"I'm just like, ""Did I do it in the wrong key?"
04:19;04:22;"The song's in C. Should it have been in A major?"
04:22;04:24;"Am I singing too high?"""
04:24;04:26;"Then I'm listening to Warren Zevon songs,"
04:26;04:28;"and I'm just like, ""Oh, my God. What am I doing?"
04:28;04:29;"This is so stupid."""
04:29;04:31;"I'm just a hobbyist."
04:31;04:37;"I'm just like a 43-year-old man who's a hobbyist."
04:37;04:41;"And I'm like, ""This was literally like a half hour ago I was doing this."""
04:41;04:45;"No, I mean, that's such a classic feeling of playing a demo for somebody else."
04:45;04:47;"You know that it's a better listening experience,"
04:47;04:49;"even if it's rough around the edges,"
04:49;04:51;"even if there's a few flat notes in the vocals,"
04:51;04:52;"even if it's not mixed right."
04:52;04:55;"It's always a better listening experience for your friend,"
04:55;04:58;"whoever you're playing it for, if you just play it."
04:58;05:02;"But it's like it sometimes feels physically impossible not to talk over it."
05:02;05:06;"So it's like that's such a classic experience of always playing somebody,"
05:06;05:08;"some early version of something,"
05:08;05:11;"and then just immediately just be like, ""Well, just so you know."""
05:11;05:14;"It's such a bewildering experience for them."
05:14;05:16;"Yeah. Vocals are rough."
05:16;05:17;"The drums are just midi."
05:17;05:19;"They're totally rough. They're not right."
05:19;05:20;"Cool. Thanks for playing it."
05:20;05:21;"Probably going to change that."
05:21;05:23;"Yeah, they just didn't hear any of the song."
05:23;05:27;"You're just monologuing over it the whole time."
05:27;05:30;"Speaking of Mountain Breeze, we've been texting a little bit."
05:30;05:32;"It seems like there's some good progress"
05:32;05:35;"because the last episode was where you were just telling the story"
05:35;05:38;"about having the worst margarita of your life at Dodger Stadium."
05:38;05:39;"Right."
05:39;05:40;"You were texting me some of the lyrics,"
05:40;05:42;"and I feel like that song's really coming along."
05:42;05:45;"Oh, yeah. The song is written. It's done."
05:45;05:47;"I recorded the chords on the acoustic,"
05:47;05:49;"and then recorded the vocals,"
05:49;05:51;"and then I sent it to the Mountain Breeze."
05:51;05:53;"And Aaron, a friend of the show, Aaron Olsen,"
05:53;05:56;"threw down a lead acoustic and some synth,"
05:56;05:59;"or some sort of midi vibraphone,"
05:59;06:02;"and some midi drums, and a bass."
06:02;06:04;"Right, because just to remind people,"
06:04;06:09;"the next Mountain Breeze EP is going for an '80s rock palette."
06:09;06:11;"This one might be more of a Zyvon-style EP."
06:11;06:13;"I think we're working on it at once."
06:13;06:16;"But anyway, yeah, so the song came together very quickly."
06:16;06:18;"I don't know. That must happen for you, right?"
06:18;06:21;"Like, where you just have the idea, and then..."
06:21;06:23;"Yeah, I had insomnia one night."
06:23;06:25;"I just sat on the couch at four in the morning"
06:25;06:28;"and wrote the lyrics to ""The Worst Margarita of My Life,"""
06:28;06:30;"which, you know..."
06:30;06:33;"Do you want to share any of the lyrics, or is it too early?"
06:33;06:34;"No, we can share the lyrics."
06:34;06:36;"I also just had a thought, too,"
06:36;06:40;"is that one day there should be a Mountain Breeze book."
06:40;06:43;"It's basically like a collected lyrics type book,"
06:43;06:45;"but it's essentially like a poetry book."
06:45;06:47;"You're just at some indie bookstore,"
06:47;06:49;"and there's just a self-published chapbook,"
06:49;06:51;"and you just pick it up, and it's called ""Mountain Breeze,"""
06:51;06:52;"and you flip through, and it's like,"
06:52;06:54;"""The Worst Margarita of My Life."""
06:54;06:56;"It's kind of like, ""Who's this new poet?"""
06:56;06:58;"""Who's this Buffet wannabe?"""
06:58;06:59;"It's a wide-open lane."
06:59;07:00;"All right, I'll read you the lyrics."
07:00;07:02;"Great radio here."
07:02;07:04;"""Lately, things don't seem the same."
07:04;07:06;"I can't focus on anything."
07:06;07:08;"Sure, I'll go to the baseball game."
07:08;07:11;"I watch the players. I don't know their names."
07:11;07:13;"But I think I know what'll cheer me up."
07:13;07:16;"Pour some sweet chili heat in a cup."
07:16;07:18;"Mix it with a sweet and salty brew."
07:18;07:21;"For $15, it ought to do."
07:21;07:23;"But it was the worst margarita of my life."""
07:23;07:27;"Wait, first of all, this does sound great as a poem."
07:27;07:29;"You know, Lana Del Rey just--"
07:29;07:31;"a spoken word song."
07:31;07:33;"I guess she's doing a poetry book"
07:33;07:35;"plus a spoken word album."
07:35;07:36;"I listened to it."
07:36;07:38;"I woke up in the middle of the night the other night,"
07:38;07:40;"and I was just, like, bleary-eyed, threw it on."
07:40;07:42;"-Wow. -And by the end of it,"
07:42;07:44;"I was like, ""This is great."""
07:44;07:45;"'Cause, of course, it's a little strange."
07:45;07:47;"You hear this familiar voice,"
07:47;07:48;"and you're like, ""Okay."""
07:48;07:50;"And then by the end, I was, like, totally sold."
07:50;07:52;"But I love-- Anyway, I can see that as a vibe, too."
07:52;07:53;"I love your cadence."
07:53;07:55;"""The worst margarita of my life."""
07:55;07:56;"I just want to say one thing."
07:56;07:59;"I think it's one of your strongest openings."
07:59;08:01;"I love that this is just a Mountain Brews"
08:01;08:03;"pep talk session, this episode."
08:03;08:04;"I was just saying in a hint, I was like,"
08:04;08:06;"""I love these lyrics I wrote."
08:06;08:08;"They're hokey, but I kind of like them."""
08:08;08:09;"I don't think it's hokey at all."
08:09;08:11;"-I can't sing them that well. -Well..."
08:11;08:12;"I'll get it."
08:12;08:13;"That's another thing that I hate,"
08:13;08:15;"is, like, kind of going and just being like,"
08:15;08:16;"""Wait, is this in the right key?"
08:16;08:18;"Should I actually be down a half-step?"""
08:18;08:19;"It just is what it is."
08:19;08:20;"Or even the opposite."
08:20;08:22;"Is it kind of low energy here?"
08:22;08:23;"Should we go up a third?"
08:23;08:25;"But I think your opening's not hokey at all."
08:25;08:28;"I think it's-- I love that it's so existential,"
08:28;08:30;"that it's just, like, this depressed dude."
08:30;08:32;"""Lately, things don't feel the same."""
08:32;08:34;"And also, like, I've never been, like,"
08:34;08:36;"a huge sports fan, but I can--"
08:36;08:38;"I know that that's a real thing."
08:38;08:39;"Obviously, if you're a sports fan,"
08:39;08:41;"you got your team for your whole life,"
08:41;08:42;"but that is a thing where it's like,"
08:42;08:44;"you have this classic period"
08:44;08:47;"where you're the right age to be obsessed with it,"
08:47;08:49;"and then people fall off a little bit,"
08:49;08:50;"and they're just like, ""Yeah, you know,"
08:50;08:52;"I still root for the Rockies."
08:52;08:54;"Yeah, I have no idea who's on the team now."
08:54;08:57;"I don't have time between work, my family."""
08:57;08:59;"It's just, like, real existential."
08:59;09:00;"I mean, I used to love baseball,"
09:00;09:02;"but, like, with the Dodgers, it's like,"
09:02;09:04;"""Mm, Clayton Kershaw."
09:04;09:07;"There's that dude with, like, the crazy, like, beard."""
09:07;09:08;"Anyway, yeah, I'm the same way."
09:08;09:10;"I don't know any of the names."
09:10;09:12;"- It's such a great metaphor for just, like,"
09:12;09:15;"life passing you by, is, like, the aging sports fan"
09:15;09:17;"who goes with his buddy to the Dodgers game,"
09:17;09:20;"and he's just looking out at these unfamiliar faces,"
09:20;09:22;"just being like, ""What am I even looking at?"""
09:22;09:25;"- And then you're just like, ""Well, at least I'll get a margarita."""
09:25;09:26;"- Yeah."
09:26;09:28;"The one bright spot is I can at least go"
09:28;09:30;"get some sweet chili heat in my cup."
09:30;09:31;"- Yeah."

10:18;10:21;"- Okay, three verses. Verse two, here we go."
10:21;10:24;"This touches directly on what we were talking about last episode."
10:24;10:28;"I like the episode informing, like a conversation with friends"
10:28;10:30;"informing a song you write."
10:30;10:33;"It goes, ""Why would a team treat their fans like this?"
10:33;10:35;"""They make their money, they don't give a sh*t."
10:35;10:37;"""Maybe it was flat mountain dew"

11:21;11:24;"- From the Dodger Stadium parking lot?"
11:24;11:27;"And all these drunk guys in their car"
11:27;11:30;"just waiting to edge out of the lot."
11:30;11:31;"Maybe you should sing the song."
11:31;11:33;"- Oh, I mean, that'd be an honor."
11:33;11:34;"- I mean, Jesus."
11:34;11:35;"- If you decide to go in that direction,"
11:35;11:36;"of course I'd be open to it."
11:36;11:40;"But I'm also cool with the pipeline we've established"
11:40;11:42;"of the Mountain Brews version comes out,"
11:42;11:45;"then Vampire debuts our cover at Red Rocks."
11:45;11:46;"- Sick."
11:46;11:47;"(laughing)"
11:47;11:49;"- We keep it going."
11:49;11:52;"Or maybe this one we'd have to do in LA."
11:52;11:54;"'Cause it's so specifically about Dodger Stadium."
11:54;11:56;"You know what it makes me think of?"
11:56;11:59;"I've never actually read David Foster Wallace."
11:59;12:01;"I know people are obsessed with him."
12:01;12:04;"It's also considered kind of like a white dude cliche"
12:04;12:06;"to be into David Foster Wallace."
12:06;12:08;"That's kind of more or less what I know."
12:08;12:10;"- Huh, you've never read any of it?"
12:10;12:12;"- No, I mean, obviously he's influential"
12:12;12:15;"'cause in some weird way his work made an impression on me"
12:15;12:16;"without me having read it."
12:16;12:18;"'Cause I know he wrote an essay or a book"
12:18;12:20;"or a short story or something"
12:20;12:22;"that's about a cruise ship called"
12:22;12:24;"""A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again."""
12:24;12:27;"- Yes, I couldn't recommend it highly enough."
12:27;12:28;"- Oh, really?"
12:28;12:29;"You know, it's funny."
12:29;12:31;"I don't know his work and yet that phrase"
12:31;12:34;"has probably been in my head for 20 years."
12:34;12:36;"""A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again."""
12:36;12:39;"And it's basically what your song makes me think of."
12:39;12:40;"- Totally."
12:40;12:42;"(laughing)"
12:42;12:44;"Yeah, well you were saying that when you read the lyrics"
12:44;12:46;"it could be like a Mountain Brews prequel."
12:46;12:48;"- Well, especially because you used the phrase"
12:48;12:49;"""Noxious Brew."""
12:49;12:50;"- Right."
12:50;12:52;"- And it's like, damn, this is Mountain Brews."
12:52;12:55;"This is the artist that we all got on board with"
12:55;13:00;"singing the joys of cracking a sweet, you know,"
13:00;13:01;"Mountain Brew at the top of the mountain,"
13:01;13:02;"sweet as morning dew."
13:02;13:05;"So it really is, as far as your beverage songs,"
13:05;13:09;"you went from like the glory of an ice cold beer"
13:09;13:11;"at the top of the mountain"
13:11;13:14;"to like the depth of a (beep) corporate"
13:14;13:17;"terrible margarita at a sporting event."
13:17;13:18;"It's like the yin yang."
13:18;13:21;"It's the duality of man, the duality of beverages."
13:21;13:22;"Yeah, so I was thinking like,"
13:22;13:25;"maybe I don't want to picture that the same dude"
13:25;13:28;"from Mountain Brews who was up on the mountain hiking"
13:28;13:30;"and kind of being fairly optimistic about life."
13:30;13:32;"I don't want to picture that this is that guy"
13:32;13:34;"a few years later and now he's just like"
13:34;13:36;"drinking the worst margarita of his life."
13:36;13:38;"So I like to picture that this is the prequel"
13:38;13:40;"and this is Saturday night."
13:40;13:42;"This dude gets invited to a Dodgers game."
13:42;13:43;"Exactly."
13:43;13:46;"He's just like, oh man, I feel weird here."
13:46;13:48;"It's kind of a bummer."
13:48;13:49;"Nothing's working out."
13:49;13:50;"The nachos suck."
13:50;13:51;"The margarita sucks."
13:51;13:53;"Leaving the park is a huge bummer."
13:53;13:55;"But then I like the idea that,"
13:55;13:56;"so this is Saturday night."
13:56;13:58;"And then what happens the next morning?"
13:58;14:00;"Is this guy just gonna, you know,"
14:00;14:03;"wallow in that kind of modern malaise?"
14:03;14:04;"No."
14:04;14:06;"The next morning, Sunday morning,"
14:06;14:07;"why don't we go for a hike?"
14:07;14:08;"Shake the cobwebs free."
14:08;14:10;"Because I don't think the Mountain Brews ethos"
14:10;14:12;"is nihilistic."
14:12;14:13;"Oh, absolutely not."
14:13;14:14;"[laughs]"
14:14;14:17;"It's a life-affirming ethos."
14:17;14:20;"Well, I'd love to hear some of your demos sometime"
14:20;14:22;"and maybe have you talk over them."
14:22;14:24;"Oh, yeah, because last time we actually did"
14:24;14:25;"a social distancing."
14:25;14:26;"We didn't crack the music."
14:26;14:28;"We didn't bust out the acoustics."
14:28;14:30;"Although I had it in my car."
14:30;14:31;"Oh, really?"
14:31;14:32;"Yeah, but it just didn't feel like the vibe."
14:32;14:34;"Just sitting on the back porch."
14:34;14:35;"Yeah."
14:35;14:37;"You just picture that going later"
14:37;14:38;"and Rashid is just like,"
14:38;14:40;"""Were you guys singing?"""
14:40;14:41;"[laughs]"
14:41;14:42;"I was just like, ""Me and Jake are gonna hang out"
14:42;14:43;"on the porch."""
14:43;14:44;"And just later, like,"
14:44;14:46;"""Were you guys listening to music?"""
14:46;14:47;"""No, we busted out the acoustics."
14:47;14:48;"We were just singing."""
14:48;14:53;"[laughs]"
14:53;14:54;"Oh, man."
14:54;14:59;"Sunday morning, why don't we go for a hike?"
14:59;15:05;"Meet in the trailhead light around a quarter to three."
15:05;15:10;"Me and Bobby stayed out late last night."
15:10;15:15;"Get on the trail, shake the cobwebs free."
15:15;15:21;"As we get to the top of the mountain, there's a view."
15:21;15:29;"Take a load off and crack a few mountain brews."
15:29;15:34;"Mountain brews."
15:34;15:40;"Sweet mountain brews."
15:40;15:45;"Mountain brews."
15:45;15:47;"Sweet as morning dew."
15:47;15:49;"You're listening to..."
15:49;15:51;"Time Crisis."
15:51;15:52;"So, let's see."
15:52;15:53;"What else is going on?"
15:53;15:54;"Seinfeld, by the way,"
15:54;15:56;"I was sad that you couldn't make the last episode"
15:56;15:59;"because we got in some sneaker talk again."
15:59;16:00;"Oh, damn."
16:00;16:01;"How did it go?"
16:01;16:03;"We were talking about the new Grateful Dead dunks."
16:03;16:04;"Oh, yeah."
16:04;16:07;"Our consensus was just a less interesting shoe"
16:07;16:09;"than the Chunky Dunkys."
16:09;16:11;"But then I felt kind of bad."
16:11;16:12;"We were a little bit harsh on them."
16:12;16:14;"We weren't accusing the Dead of selling out or anything."
16:14;16:16;"My point was they've always been branding."
16:16;16:18;"They've been doing partnerships for decades."
16:18;16:20;"There's nothing weird about this."
16:20;16:24;"I just personally wish the shoe turned out a little different."
16:24;16:27;"But since then, I feel like I just see it more and more."
16:27;16:29;"It almost feels like the Chunky Dunkys part two."
16:29;16:31;"It does seem like a big deal."
16:31;16:34;"So what's the word in the sneaker community, Seinfeld?"
16:34;16:36;"Well, a quick look at StockX reveals"
16:36;16:41;"that these Grateful Dead dunks are going for $1,000 to $4,000"
16:41;16:42;"on the resale market."
16:42;16:44;"$4,000?"
16:44;16:46;"Yeah, the orange ones are $4,000."
16:46;16:48;"Jake, what's your shoe size?"
16:48;16:49;"Nine."
16:49;16:55;"So, Jake, if you wanted a size nine orange Grateful Dead Bears SB Dunk,"
16:55;16:57;"that would be $4,500."
16:57;16:58;"Worth it."
16:58;17:03;"Did you see the email I forwarded you that somebody was giving up their Grateful Dead?"
17:03;17:05;"I think it was a size--"
17:05;17:06;"Nine and a half."
17:06;17:07;"It was a nine and a half."
17:07;17:09;"You could put some insoles."
17:09;17:12;"Wait, wait, somebody emailed Time Crisis saying, ""I've got an extra pair."""
17:12;17:14;"Yeah, somebody said--"
17:14;17:15;"Fan of the show."
17:15;17:21;"Yeah, they said, ""I won this pair on dead.net or debt.com or something."
17:21;17:26;"And if you guys want a 9.5, you know, I just send it over."""
17:26;17:28;"I wasn't sure if you'd be interested."
17:28;17:33;"I hope they're a billionaire if they're passing up almost $5,000"
17:33;17:35;"just to hook up the TC community."
17:35;17:39;"Or maybe they're just like a true deadhead if we said to them,"
17:39;17:43;"""That's too generous. You could get $5,000 for this on StockX."""
17:43;17:45;"They would just be like, ""That wouldn't be very kind, man."""
17:45;17:47;"That's right."
17:47;17:51;"The universe smiled on me, and I'm just paying it forward."
17:51;17:53;"Well, shout out to that person."
17:53;17:54;"That's very nice of them."
17:54;17:59;"I got to ask, is there any shoe that the Dunks would release"
17:59;18:01;"that wouldn't go for a lot of money?"
18:01;18:04;"I mean, is this a discernible crowd?"
18:04;18:08;"I think that if there wasn't something kind of novelty about it,"
18:08;18:13;"like if it was just a not very special kind of basic-looking Dunk,"
18:13;18:15;"those would probably go for retail."
18:15;18:19;"I think any kind of newfangled collaboration that's a little bit like,"
18:19;18:24;"""Oh, this person worked with this. That's always going to go nuts."""
18:24;18:28;"Yeah, even if it was the ugliest shoe of all time."
18:28;18:31;"I think the uglier, the more sought after, to be honest with you,"
18:31;18:34;"as we're seeing play out."
18:34;18:38;"Nike SB Dunks are teaming up with Mountain Brews to present a shoe"
18:38;18:41;"that's based on the worst margarita of Jake's life."
18:41;18:42;"That's right."
18:42;18:45;"It's a kind of unnatural yellow color."
18:46;18:50;"It's basically just all different gnarly shades of yellow."
18:50;18:53;"It's kind of like an unnatural Mountain Dew yellow."
18:53;18:58;"And then the Nike swoosh looks like nasty Dodger Stadium."
18:58;19:01;"The LA Dodgers logo."
19:01;19:04;"And the soles are sticky."
19:04;19:06;"Melting nacho cheese."
19:06;19:12;"The top where you put your foot in is crusted in salt."
19:12;19:15;"Oh yeah."
19:15;19:21;"Do you know those stripper pumps that have goldfish floating in the heel?"
19:21;19:23;"You know that classic?"
19:23;19:26;"It would have actual margarita in the sole."
19:26;19:29;"There would be a layer of liquid."
19:29;19:32;"Yeah, you could insert a straw and suck it out."
19:32;19:33;"Yeah, exactly."
19:33;19:36;"Just like a rancid, disgusting margarita."
19:36;19:39;"Seinfeld, quick number crunch request."
19:39;19:43;"You were talking about Dior did a collaboration with Nike."
19:43;19:44;"Yes."
19:44;19:48;"How many pairs did they manufacture and offer to the market?"
19:48;19:51;"It's my understanding that Nike just doesn't release those numbers."
19:51;19:53;"It's like Netflix."
19:53;19:55;"It's these streaming services."
19:55;19:58;"According to the internet, it says there are 13,000 pairs"
19:58;20:02;"with 5,000 offered to Dior top clients."
20:02;20:03;"Wow."
20:03;20:05;"What's the primary market value of those shoes?"
20:05;20:08;"Like if you were offered the opportunity to buy those shoes,"
20:08;20:10;"how much would they be?"
20:10;20:14;"Typically, these types of high-end collaborations will retail for"
20:14;20:15;"the price of a standard."
20:15;20:18;"I think the Grateful Dead ones were like $200 or something."
20:18;20:20;"And the Chunky Cookies were like..."
20:20;20:23;"But these Dior ones were actually, because they're a luxury item,"
20:23;20:26;"their retail price was $2,200."
20:26;20:29;"And they are now retailing for $12,200."
20:29;20:32;"If you want a size 6, that's $23,000."
20:32;20:34;"That must be such a weird scene."
20:34;20:37;"The sneaker broker guys."
20:37;20:39;"There must be guys who are like hoarding."
20:39;20:41;"I have a funny story about that."
20:41;20:45;"I'm not really into shoes or sneaker culture."
20:45;20:48;"But a friend of the show, Jonah Weiner,"
20:48;20:53;"had hit me to these very interesting, very ugly New Balances"
20:53;20:56;"that were made of other New Balances."
20:56;21:00;"Like they were sort of cobbled together from the recycled other New Balances."
21:00;21:01;"They were Frankenstein."
21:01;21:02;"And I thought they were really great."
21:02;21:04;"And so I went and I found a pair."
21:04;21:06;"And I was like, ""How did I find this?"""
21:06;21:08;"And he told me he did some digging."
21:08;21:11;"And that he had found that some second market guy"
21:11;21:13;"had basically bought them all when they dropped."
21:13;21:16;"I mean, like, these are going to be sick."
21:16;21:17;"And really sought after."
21:17;21:19;"And so nobody bought them."
21:19;21:23;"And so this guy was left with like hundreds of these shoes."
21:23;21:25;"Like he took a gamble."
21:25;21:26;"Oh, he messed up."
21:26;21:27;"Yeah, and he messed up."
21:27;21:29;"I've only done something like that once in my life."
21:29;21:31;"And I kind of was just reminded of it."
21:31;21:34;"So it's very possible I'm sitting on a goldmine now."
21:34;21:38;"When I was in middle school, I was very into comic books."
21:38;21:41;"So I was like always going to like comic book stores and stuff."
21:41;21:44;"And I wasn't particularly into like toys."
21:44;21:45;"That's a type."
21:45;21:48;"Kind of intersects with sneaker culture and comic book culture."
21:48;21:51;"It's people who collect figurines and toys and stuff."
21:51;21:53;"That was never really what I was into."
21:53;21:55;"But, you know, because I'd be in comic book stores all the time,"
21:55;21:57;"I'd see that stuff a lot."
21:57;22:01;"And I remember this was also the era when Power Rangers was really popular."
22:01;22:03;"And I might be totally wrong about this."
22:03;22:07;"But there was some plot line where there was like a new Power Ranger showed up."
22:07;22:09;"And I think he was like green at first."
22:09;22:14;"But then he went through some sort of transformative experience on the show."
22:14;22:16;"And he became the white Power Ranger."
22:16;22:19;"Seinfeld, can I get a number crunch on this? Is this correct?"
22:19;22:20;"There was some sort of transfer."
22:20;22:24;"Or maybe he was the white Power Ranger and he became the gold Power Ranger."
22:24;22:27;"Yeah, this is from the film from what I can tell."
22:27;22:33;"The green Power Ranger in season two became the new white Power Ranger."
22:33;22:35;"Oh, he became the white Power Ranger."
22:35;22:39;"So I think I was vaguely aware of what was happening in the Power Rangers universe."
22:39;22:43;"And there's a comic book store I went to that had a lot of Power Rangers toys."
22:43;22:46;"Well, I used to always, you know, look at, I think I've said this on the show before,"
22:46;22:50;"there was the magazine Wizard that would in the back have all the prices,"
22:50;22:52;"the market prices for comic books."
22:52;22:54;"And they were always like wildly inaccurate."
22:54;22:58;"So I think I had the sense of like, wow, if you keep a toy in its packaging,"
22:58;23:00;"it can be worth insane money."
23:00;23:03;"So at some point I just remember going to the comic book store"
23:03;23:08;"and seeing they had a new white Power Ranger toy, obviously in the packaging."
23:08;23:12;"And I just remember thinking, you know, I would always be like saving up to buy comic books,"
23:12;23:14;"which probably at that time cost like two or three bucks each."
23:14;23:16;"And I remember this cost 15 bucks."
23:16;23:19;"And I was like, I was like, I'm going to blow my life savings on this,"
23:19;23:21;"but I'm going to keep this white Power Ranger."
23:21;23:23;"Or maybe I bought the green Power Ranger, whatever it was."
23:23;23:26;"I bought something related to that plot line that I had this feeling."
23:26;23:30;"I was like, this is this rare turning point moment that people are going to look back in history"
23:30;23:34;"and the toys associated with it are going to be very valuable,"
23:34;23:36;"especially if he goes back to being the green Power Ranger."
23:36;23:40;"So then I remember like buying it and like keeping it in my closet."
23:40;23:44;"And then seeing that and being like, oh man, that was stupid."
23:44;23:49;"But it must be somewhere in unopened white Power Ranger."
23:49;23:51;"So is it worth anything?"
23:51;23:55;"So I'm on eBay right now, and I think I've located the product that you're talking about."
23:55;24:00;"If it's the Bandai White Legacy Ranger, five inch Tommy figure,"
24:00;24:03;"and it looks like it's going for $28."
24:03;24:05;"It's more than 15."
24:05;24:07;"I remember having that feeling too about baseball cards,"
24:07;24:12;"like that sort of like young speculative capitalist impulse."
24:12;24:21;"For some reason, I ended up buying a box of 1990 Dunross baseball cards"
24:21;24:28;"and then not opening the packs because I thought like it'd be sick to have like a box of like unopened packs."
24:28;24:33;"And of course, like by 1990, like the baseball card market was completely flooded"
24:33;24:36;"and like those cards are worthless."
24:36;24:39;"And I remember just like maybe like 10 years ago,"
24:39;24:44;"I remember finding that 1990 Dunross box and just like throwing it straight into the trash."
24:44;24:47;"It had been sitting in storage for like 25 years or whatever."
24:47;24:51;"I was so hoping when I looked this up that it was worth just like $10,000."
24:51;24:54;"Oh, the 1990 Dunross box?"
24:54;24:57;"It's just nothing would have made me happier."
24:57;25:00;"What's it going for? Like a box of packs?"
25:00;25:03;"There are individual cards from that 1990 pack."
25:03;25:09;"But some of those cards, though, if you have like the Barry Bonds one from 1990, that's $20 just for that one card."
25:09;25:11;"A 90 Dunross?"
25:11;25:13;"Yeah, a 90 Dun... a Bonds."
25:13;25:15;"There's no way that's $20."
25:15;25:18;"I'm on oldsportscards.com."
25:18;25:22;"The most expensive card is one Gonzalez at $100."
25:22;25:24;"A 1990 Dunross?"
25:24;25:26;"Yes."
25:26;25:29;"I guess cards got expensive again. Is that his rookie card?"
25:29;25:30;"Yes."
25:30;25:36;"There's no way someone's spending $100 on a Juan Gonzalez rookie card in 2020."
25:36;25:37;"There's no way."
25:37;25:42;"How much is the '89 Upper Deck King Griffey Jr. rookie card going for?"
25:42;25:44;"Because that was like a classic card."
25:44;25:46;"This is the worst..."
25:46;25:48;"worst radio."
25:48;25:50;"Oh, Ezra got disconnected."
25:50;25:53;"That's cool. I want to get a quote on that '89 Griffey."
25:53;25:54;"Jake, do you have that card?"
25:54;25:55;"Maybe."
25:55;25:58;"It's going for $2,500 on eBay."
25:58;25:59;"Wow."
25:59;26:02;"Yeah, the '89 Upper Deck King Griffey Jr."
26:02;26:04;"It's got to be mint, though."
26:04;26:05;"Yeah, sure."
26:05;26:08;"People get psycho about stuff being mint."
26:08;26:12;"What's a 1980 Topps Ricky Henderson rookie going for?"
26:12;26:15;"I'm just remembering some cards I had."
26:15;26:22;"Okay, we've got the 1980 Topps Ricky Henderson card going for $29,995."
26:22;26:23;"No!"
26:23;26:24;"Yeah, I'll send you the link."
26:24;26:25;"Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait."
26:25;26:27;"Oh, I thought this was autographed."
26:27;26:29;"No, it's not autographed."
26:29;26:30;"What?"
26:30;26:33;"$30,000 plus $30 shipping."
26:33;26:34;"What?"
26:34;26:36;"I mean, I'll send you this link."
26:36;26:38;"I think cards got really expensive again."
26:38;26:41;"How much is a 1984 Topps Don Mattingly?"
26:41;26:45;"That is going for..."
26:45;26:49;"This is what happens when Ezra leaves the conversation."
26:49;26:53;"We're in the show rules moment."
26:53;26:57;"Did we find out, Jake, that the box of cards you threw out is worth a small fortune?"
26:57;26:59;"No, that's not worth anything, but I do have cards."
26:59;27:01;"That's what I was hoping."
27:01;27:04;"But he may have a small fortune in some of his other cards."
27:04;27:05;"I can't believe that."
27:05;27:06;"So now he's just going through."
27:06;27:08;"Wait, how much is that '84 Mattingly?"
27:08;27:12;"That is... I'm seeing one for $11.99."
27:12;27:15;"I'm seeing another one for $10."
27:15;27:16;"See, okay."
27:16;27:19;"Obviously, Mattingly's not a Hall of Famer."
27:19;27:20;"Ricky Henderson is."
27:20;27:23;"Ricky Henderson, all-time stolen bass leader."
27:23;27:25;"But $30,000?"
27:25;27:30;"I remember that card was worth like $100 when I was a kid and I traded for it."
27:30;27:32;"And I was so fired up."
27:32;27:34;"And I had it in one of those hard plastic sleeves."
27:34;27:36;"And I still have it. I have that."
27:36;27:37;"Dude."
27:37;27:39;"But it's not mint."
27:39;27:40;"People are psycho."
27:40;27:45;"Trade card people, like adults who trade cards, are psycho about the conditions."
27:45;27:46;"I wonder how much in non-mint."
27:46;27:47;"Let me see here."
27:47;27:49;"Oh, there's a reprint."
27:49;27:51;"There's one going for $50."
27:51;27:54;"It seems like it's pre-owned."
27:54;27:55;"That's probably what mine would be."
27:55;27:57;"I bet mine would be worth $50."
27:57;28:02;"Yeah, I don't know what the discrepancy, like how we go from $50 to $30,000."
28:02;28:07;"It's sort of like when old records are sealed and they've never been opened."
28:07;28:12;"And it's like, ""Oh, Velvet Underground, first record, sealed, never been played."""
28:12;28:14;"That's the stuff that goes for a ton of money."
28:14;28:16;"I bet it's similar."
28:16;28:21;"This says, ""Very sharp and mint. Corners are sharp. No creases or dings."""
28:21;28:23;"Corners are sharp."
28:23;28:25;"The corners are sharp. It's important."
28:25;28:29;"I remember going to baseball card shows when I was a kid."
28:29;28:34;"There'd be this pure Simpsons comic store guy."
28:34;28:38;"He'd have this monocle out, you know, his magnifying glass,"
28:38;28:42;"inspecting the corners and edges of the card."
28:42;28:47;"And they'd be like, ""Okay, we do have one certified grader here at the fair."
28:47;28:51;"So if you have a card you think is worth a lot of money, stand in line."
28:51;28:54;"We'll have the certified grader take a look at your card."""
28:54;28:56;"The original Antiques Roadshow."
28:56;28:58;"He will appraise the value."
28:58;29:00;"We should go out and pitch a reality show."
29:00;29:02;"The Time Crisis Production Company."
29:02;29:07;"We're like, ""If you feel like Antiques Roadshow is just way too all over the place,"
29:07;29:10;"we're basically taking that concept, but it's just about baseball cards."
29:10;29:12;"Only baseball cards."""
29:12;29:14;"It wouldn't surprise me if that already existed."
29:14;29:16;"-On like... -On YouTube?"
29:16;29:19;"Channel 900. Yeah, or YouTube or something."
29:19;29:24;"♪ I don't care how far ♪"
29:24;29:29;"♪ This is where I go ♪"
29:29;29:33;"♪ We all know ♪"
29:33;29:39;"♪ Don't you ever let me go ♪"
29:39;29:43;"♪ Don't you ever let me go ♪"
29:51;29:54;"♪ Don't you ever let me go ♪"
29:54;29:58;"♪ Don't you ever let me go ♪"
29:58;30:03;"♪ Don't you ever let me go ♪"
30:03;30:08;"This makes me think of some article I remember reading years ago."
30:08;30:10;"The theme of the article was essentially,"
30:10;30:14;"""What's going to happen to all of these collectibles"
30:14;30:18;"when subsequent generations give zero f***s about them?"""
30:18;30:20;"It might not be baseball cards."
30:20;30:22;"I've always been curious about stamps."
30:22;30:26;"How many people under 40 are serious stamp collectors?"
30:26;30:28;"Even if there are serious stamp collectors,"
30:28;30:31;"you need a lot of people to keep the value up, to keep the prices up."
30:31;30:33;"You need people bidding against each other."
30:33;30:37;"Forget about stamps and baseball cards, classic collectible stuff."
30:37;30:43;"Then you start to get to people who collect 19th century coffee tins,"
30:43;30:47;"or potato mashers, or somebody who's like,"
30:47;30:53;"""Oh yeah, I'm an expert on hammers produced in New England from 1915 and 1930."""
30:53;30:56;"It's already probably these communities are so small."
30:56;30:58;"My memory is that in the article,"
30:58;31:02;"there was somebody who collects some weird thing at a huge collection."
31:02;31:05;"There was a sad quote from them, an older person being like,"
31:05;31:08;"""I don't even care if I ever get back the money I spent on this stuff."
31:08;31:12;"I just hope I could find a young person who can just steward the collection."""
31:12;31:15;"I also remember reading about a dude in the Bronx"
31:15;31:20;"who has this insane VHS collection of boxing matches"
31:20;31:24;"because he would obsessively tape them off TV for decades."
31:24;31:26;"There is a lot of stuff that gets lost to time"
31:26;31:28;"that the network didn't have an archive."
31:28;31:32;"This guy has such an extensive collection of boxing video tapes"
31:32;31:35;"that there have been times where he's acted at the lending library"
31:35;31:37;"where some trainer is like,"
31:37;31:41;"""I can't find this one fight from 1975. It's not on YouTube."
31:41;31:43;"I called ESPN, they don't have it."""
31:43;31:46;"This guy's like, ""I got it. You can borrow the tape for five bucks."""
31:46;31:48;"I think there's a lot of weird stuff like that."
31:48;31:49;"I even think about just CDs."
31:49;31:52;"I'm sure there's some CDs that are valuable."
31:52;31:56;"I still have in a box somewhere probably a few hundred CDs."
31:56;31:58;"I've given away a lot and thrown out some,"
31:58;32:01;"but sometimes I pick up one with sentimental value."
32:01;32:04;"Are 99% of all CDs ever produced"
32:04;32:07;"just going to end up in a landfill, melted down?"
32:07;32:11;"Definitely. I got rid of my CDs probably 15 years ago."
32:11;32:14;"Even your beloved CDs, even GBV?"
32:14;32:17;"I think I do have a box of my friends' CDs"
32:17;32:20;"and that first Vampire Weekend, Blue CD-R."
32:20;32:22;"- Stuff that-- - Tight."
32:22;32:27;"Stuff like that and maybe a few of my favorite CDs I still held on to."
32:27;32:29;"I was going to say, the boxing VHS guy,"
32:29;32:32;"that seems a little different because he's a singular source"
32:32;32:35;"for an archive of things that people actually care about."
32:35;32:37;"It does get weird with collectors"
32:37;32:40;"when you're collecting mass-produced things"
32:40;32:42;"and then the collection starts to own you"
32:42;32:44;"as opposed to you owning the collection."
32:44;32:48;"I guess in my peer group, I see that most with vinyl."
32:48;32:51;"Obviously, vinyl has become the go-to physical thing."
32:51;32:54;"I do find that sometimes if I see an image"
32:54;32:57;"from a really cool, well-designed CD from the '90s,"
32:57;33:01;"I'm like, ""I do love CDs. I would never throw out all of my CDs."""
33:01;33:04;"Of course, there's some people, if you still have a CD player in your car,"
33:04;33:07;"it's worth owning if it's your favorite band or you're actually using it."
33:07;33:10;"But the concept of having a big CD collection--"
33:10;33:13;"People used to have those towers in the corner."
33:13;33:15;"Oh, hell yeah."
33:15;33:18;"Do you guys have your CDs in a booklet, like one of those binder things?"
33:18;33:20;"Because that's what I did. I got rid of the cases."
33:20;33:22;"Even that was a little bit sad."
33:22;33:25;"Now they've all been consolidated into a couple of different binders."
33:25;33:29;"What was the company that was the go-to for the CD binders?"
33:29;33:31;"I seem to remember--"
33:31;33:33;"I could never do that."
33:33;33:35;"You need to keep the liner notes and the cases."
33:35;33:37;"Oh, absolutely."
33:37;33:39;"It was Case Logic."
33:39;33:41;"Case Logic. That's right."
33:41;33:43;"Good name."
33:43;33:45;"I hope Case Logic diversified."
33:45;33:48;"It's funny, actually. Ariel just told me a story about being 18 or 19"
33:48;33:51;"and going to visit somebody in Ireland."
33:51;33:56;"He brought his big Case Logic with probably 80 or 100 of his most prized CDs"
33:56;33:58;"because they were going to road trip."
33:58;34:04;"And then, you know, jet-lagged and confused and trying to get some money or whatever."
34:04;34:07;"He basically left it somewhere and he didn't know where."
34:07;34:09;"And he couldn't find it."
34:09;34:10;"Oh, man."
34:10;34:13;"It is interesting to think that now nobody would care."
34:13;34:16;"But in that era, to lose your big Case Logic,"
34:16;34:18;"the amount of money and time--"
34:18;34:19;"Devastating."
34:19;34:20;"Horrible."
34:20;34:23;"Ezra, you'll be happy to know that Case Logic is still going strong."
34:23;34:29;"They did diversify and they make cases now for laptops, tablets, cameras, and even drones."
34:29;34:30;"[LAUGHTER]"
34:30;34:32;"Wait."
34:32;34:35;"You can put your drone collection into a Case Logic?"
34:35;34:38;"I think it's a single drone backpack."
34:38;34:42;"I don't think it's like a multiple drone binder that they're selling."
34:42;34:44;"I just had an actually good idea."
34:44;34:46;"Not just like a flight of fancy."
34:46;34:48;"I'm sure somebody will do this if they haven't already."
34:48;34:53;"Some cool streetwear brand should do a collection with Case Logic."
34:53;34:55;"That seems like a job for Supreme."
34:55;34:58;"Yeah, maybe Supreme or Nike could do the SB Case Logic dunks."
34:58;35:03;"Or even just like some kind of edgy streetwear Japanese brand."
35:03;35:06;"Like Beanz in Japan, they did one with Ziploc."
35:06;35:08;"And it was actually pretty cool."
35:08;35:12;"They had fun with using see-through stuff and they made umbrellas and jackets."
35:12;35:16;"It'd be very subtle because Case Logic already looks like normal clothes."
35:16;35:22;"But just doing like this techie jacket is inspired by a 90s Case Logic binder."
35:22;35:24;"We're using the real materials."
35:24;35:26;"It says Case Logic on it."
35:26;35:33;"Maybe it's a mix of the black fabric, the zipper, and also a little bit of the see-through plastic that held the CDs."
35:33;35:35;"You could really do a Case Logic collection."
36:40;36:42;"Okay, so now we have a very special guest."
36:42;36:46;"Which amazingly, I don't know if she's ever been on Time Crisis before."
36:46;36:49;"Because we have had a member of the Haim family on the show."
36:49;36:53;"We had Alana Haim, aka Baby Haim, way back in the day."
36:53;36:55;"Correct? I get a number crunch on that."
36:55;36:59;"She was on episode 12, way back in 2015."
36:59;37:02;"And then actually, technically, she was on the Webster show, right?"
37:02;37:05;"Because we talked to Haim as part of that show."
37:05;37:06;"But I don't know if that really counts."
37:06;37:10;"That was a bit of a departure from the classic Time Crisis format."
37:10;37:15;"Well, this is going to be the first time we have a solo Danielle on the show."
37:15;37:18;"Obviously, a friend of the organization."
37:18;37:20;"Haim put out a great album a few weeks ago."
37:20;37:23;"So I've been wanting to have her on the show just to catch up."
37:23;37:25;"And maybe talk some Eagles."
37:25;37:27;"That was an idea I had."
37:27;37:29;"But you know, this conversation could go anywhere."
37:29;37:31;"Is the truth."
37:31;37:34;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
37:34;37:38;"(phone ringing)"
37:38;37:39;"What's up?"
37:39;37:41;"Oh, what's up? Hey, Danielle."
37:41;37:42;"How's it going?"
37:42;37:43;"Danielle, welcome to the show."
37:43;37:47;"We calculated this is actually your first time on the show."
37:47;37:48;"We've had other Haims."
37:48;37:50;"I know. Alana, right?"
37:50;37:52;"Yeah. Way back in the day."
37:52;37:53;"So what are you doing?"
37:53;37:55;"You put a great album out about a month ago."
37:55;37:57;"But obviously, it's COVID."
37:57;37:58;"So you're not on tour."
37:58;37:59;"Not on tour."
37:59;38:01;"Yeah, I'm just hanging."
38:01;38:03;"I mean, I'm trying to be creative."
38:03;38:05;"But it's a little hard."
38:05;38:06;"I feel you."
38:06;38:08;"Well, I thought maybe today,"
38:08;38:11;"we talk about rock music a little bit."
38:11;38:16;"Because, well, I mean, we see each other a lot in real life."
38:16;38:19;"So I got to think about what we've already talked about."
38:19;38:21;"But tell me, is this true?"
38:21;38:25;"I've always felt like because Haim has equally pulled"
38:25;38:28;"over the course of your career from kind of like a world"
38:28;38:31;"you might call more pop or R&B, but also rock,"
38:31;38:34;"do you feel like the critics and the journalists"
38:34;38:39;"in the early days kind of downplayed your rock credentials?"
38:39;38:41;"And that's always been one thing I found interesting"
38:41;38:44;"about you and the band is you've always existed"
38:44;38:45;"in kind of your own lane."
38:45;38:48;"I don't really associate other bands with you."
38:48;38:52;"It wasn't like, oh, those are the LA bands of their generation."
38:52;38:55;"So do you feel like Haim is a rock band?"
38:55;38:58;"And do you think you've been seen as a rock band?"
38:58;39:00;"Because I know your background is pretty rock."
39:00;39:04;"Well, I got to say, like, when we were kind of coming up"
39:04;39:08;"in the LA scene or whatever, just playing like"
39:08;39:11;"Silver Lake Lounge and The Echo and Bootleg"
39:11;39:14;"and like The Satellite, it's now called."
39:14;39:18;"But or Spaceland, like when we were kind of playing it,"
39:18;39:22;"I do feel like the bands that we were playing with,"
39:22;39:27;"like they didn't with like pop music or poppier music."
39:27;39:30;"And I always listened in my car at the time."
39:30;39:32;"I didn't have a CD player."
39:32;39:34;"So like I just listened to the radio and I would listen"
39:34;39:37;"to Kiss FM and Kareth 101."
39:37;39:40;"And I just always was a big pop fan."
39:40;39:45;"So I remember like being I don't know how to describe it."
39:45;39:48;"Just I just never really understood the snobbiness against pop music."
39:48;39:51;"And I kind of feel like I almost like embraced it"
39:51;39:54;"because I was just so like over people taking themselves"
39:54;39:58;"so seriously in my like community, I guess."
39:58;39:59;"Does that make sense?"
39:59;40:01;"Yeah, like the kind of old school,"
40:01;40:04;"raucous snob who just like, yeah, I find people tend to say"
40:04;40:06;"this stuff much less these days."
40:06;40:08;"But yeah, that when people used to say it, be like,"
40:08;40:10;"oh, my God, like that pop singer,"
40:10;40:12;"they don't even write their own stuff."
40:12;40:13;"They don't even play."
40:13;40:16;"And it's like kind of like, well, who cares if the music's good?"
40:16;40:19;"And obviously that also shows some ignorance about how"
40:19;40:21;"a lot of classic rock records were made,"
40:21;40:23;"where they'd be like bringing in ringers to play"
40:23;40:24;"and all this stuff anyway."
40:24;40:27;"But before that period, you know, and some of this is like"
40:27;40:29;"the hardcore Haim fans, they know all this stuff."
40:29;40:32;"But you guys first played together in a band"
40:32;40:34;"with your parents called Rock and Haim"
40:34;40:35;"when you guys were like little, right?"
40:35;40:36;"Yeah. Yes."
40:36;40:39;"What was like a classic Rock and Haim setlist?"
40:39;40:41;"Oh, you ready?"
40:41;40:45;"I mean, yeah, Van Morrison, Wild Nights,"
40:45;40:48;"classic Haim brought down the house."
40:48;40:51;"How old were you as a kid in Rock and Haim's peak?"
40:51;40:55;"So our first gig was at the Kibbitz Room at Canner's."
40:55;40:59;"Esty and I both, I had a guitar teacher named Bill Wiseman"
40:59;41:02;"and Esty had a bass teacher named Lou Castro."
41:02;41:06;"And they were like jazz guys who played at the Kibbitz Room"
41:06;41:08;"like every Tuesday night, I think."
41:08;41:12;"And so, you know, I think my dad was like,"
41:12;41:14;"""Hey, like, could you get us a gig?"""
41:14;41:17;"And they were like, ""Well, ask, sure."""
41:17;41:19;"And like, I remember they like famously got paid."
41:19;41:22;"They just love to play and they would have the standing gig"
41:22;41:25;"and get like basically paid in food."
41:25;41:28;"You know, they'd play a couple hours"
41:28;41:31;"and then they'd like go eat for free."
41:31;41:34;"Yeah, I think my dad asked like after one of my guitar lessons,"
41:34;41:37;"like, ""Hey, like, do you think you guys could get us a gig"
41:37;41:39;"at the Kibbitz Room?"""
41:39;41:42;"And, you know, we started, you know, dabbling in like,"
41:42;41:45;"you know, practicing every couple of weekends,"
41:45;41:48;"you know, some like new songs and like new covers."
41:48;41:50;"My parents never wrote music."
41:50;41:52;"So that was our first, we had like one big gig"
41:52;41:55;"that we rehearsed like months for."
41:55;41:57;"Wait, how old, you were like in middle school?"
41:57;41:59;"I was in fifth grade."
41:59;42:03;"Etsy was in eighth grade."
42:03;42:06;"Lana was in second grade."
42:06;42:07;"Truly a baby."
42:07;42:08;"But for people who don't know,"
42:08;42:11;"the Kibbitz Room is just like, it's attached to Canner's,"
42:11;42:13;"which is like a famous Jewish restaurant deli."
42:13;42:17;"But the Kibbitz Room, it's just kind of like a dank, dark bar."
42:17;42:19;"Yeah, it's a full-on bar."
42:19;42:20;"I don't understand how..."
42:20;42:23;"[laughing]"
42:23;42:26;"I don't understand how like a bunch of kids rolled up"
42:26;42:28;"with their parents and their friends."
42:28;42:29;"I'm in the Kibbitz Room."
42:29;42:30;"Yeah, go ahead, Jake."
42:30;42:31;"No, I was going to say,"
42:31;42:34;"I associate the Kibbitz Room with Guns N' Roses."
42:34;42:37;"Right, they're like famous, they're like them."
42:37;42:41;"And I feel like Jacob Dillon's band, The Wallflowers,"
42:41;42:44;"they're like the famous Canner's bands."
42:44;42:45;"And not just playing there,"
42:45;42:47;"because also like Slash and Axl would probably"
42:47;42:50;"just go get [beep] faced in the Kibbitz Room too."
42:50;42:54;"Well, the owner of Canner's actually managed"
42:54;42:56;"Guns N' Roses, like early days."
42:56;42:57;"Oh, wow."
42:57;42:59;"Yeah, that's some Canner's knowledge right there."
42:59;43:02;"Okay, so this is like, it's like a loud, dank rock club,"
43:02;43:08;"and then the Hyde family is doing like classic rock covers?"
43:08;43:09;"Yeah."
43:09;43:11;"Wait, also, just to put this in perspective,"
43:11;43:13;"what year would this be?"
43:13;43:15;"What year were you in fifth grade?"
43:15;43:16;"This is 2000."
43:16;43:19;"In the year 2000, playing this kind of dank bar"
43:19;43:20;"on a weeknight."
43:20;43:23;"Okay, Wild Knight, Van Morrison,"
43:23;43:26;"popularized by John Mellencamp in the '90s."
43:26;43:28;"And you're playing guitar and singing?"
43:28;43:30;"I'm playing guitar and singing."
43:30;43:32;"My mom, no, no, no, my dad played drums."
43:32;43:37;"And then Donna Rose, Hyam, played guitar and sang."
43:37;43:40;"Blue Suede Shoes was big."
43:40;43:43;"That was a big Rockin' Hyam jammer."
43:43;43:45;"I mean, Mustang Sally, always."
43:45;43:47;"Billy Joel."
43:47;43:49;"What songs?"
43:49;43:50;"You May Be Right."
43:50;43:52;"Oh, of course."
43:52;43:53;"Of course."
43:53;43:54;"That's kind of sophisticated."
43:54;43:56;"You May Be Right."
43:56;43:59;"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
43:59;44:01;"That's like a good guitar riff right there."
44:01;44:04;"[singing]"
44:04;44:06;"Riffing solos in fifth grade?"
44:06;44:09;"No, so the big song that we ended up learning,"
44:09;44:13;"I think it kind of changed my relationship to guitar,"
44:13;44:15;"was Hotel California."
44:15;44:16;"Oh, that's a perfect segue,"
44:16;44:18;"because I wanted to talk about Eagles,"
44:18;44:20;"because between your gig, too big Eagles song."
44:20;44:21;"So when I cracked that solo,"
44:21;44:23;"I think I must have then been in seventh grade."
44:23;44:24;"Wow."
44:24;44:28;"I mean, I was awful, and I messed it up every time,"
44:28;44:30;"but I tried."
44:30;44:32;"You guys straight up covered Hotel California,"
44:32;44:33;"just the family."
44:33;44:34;"There was nobody else on stage?"
44:34;44:35;"Just the family."
44:35;44:38;"I mean, it was a stripped-back version, for sure."
44:38;44:43;"We would definitely do our own kind of versions of these songs."
44:43;44:47;"They weren't fully exactly like the originals."
44:47;44:50;"Famously, that solo has the part where--"
44:50;44:51;"Right."
44:51;44:54;"So it was just me doing harmony at the end."
44:54;44:55;"Guitar-mony."
44:55;45:01;"[singing]"
45:01;45:04;"I mean, to even remotely be able to play that in seventh grade"
45:04;45:06;"is very impressive."
45:06;45:09;"Have you ever considered just like with the hymn,"
45:09;45:12;"busting out a very faithful Hotel California?"
45:12;45:14;"No."
45:14;45:16;"Honestly, it's not my favorite Eagles song."
45:16;45:17;"What is?"
45:17;45:20;"[laughs]"
45:20;45:21;"That's a hard one."
45:21;45:22;"What about you guys?"
45:22;45:24;"Well, I'll defer to Jake."
45:24;45:27;"I really like the sort of early '70s Glenn Frey ballads."
45:27;45:29;"Like, I love ""Lyin' Eyes."""
45:29;45:30;"I love ""Lyin' Eyes."""
45:30;45:31;"I love ""Take It Easy."""
45:31;45:33;"I mean, those are probably--"
45:33;45:36;"So like the real easy listening ones."
45:36;45:38;"Yeah, the country rock stuff."
45:38;45:41;"I mean, I think ""Lyin' Eyes"" is probably my favorite,"
45:41;45:43;"but also ""Take It to the Limit,"" ""Rainy Night."""
45:43;45:44;"""Take It to the Limit"" is so good."
45:44;45:45;"I mean, that's sick."
45:45;45:47;"You guys could crush ""Take It to the Limit."""
45:47;45:48;"The high?"
45:48;45:49;"Oh, yeah."
45:49;45:53;"I like this idea of contemporary high band"
45:53;45:55;"doing like an Eagles cover."
45:55;45:56;"Yeah."
45:56;45:58;"I mean, it would be cool because if a lot of bands"
45:58;46:02;"busted into Hotel California or whatever song you like better,"
46:02;46:05;"it would just be so like, all right, low-hanging fruit,"
46:05;46:08;"but it's actually part of your heritage."
46:08;46:09;"Wait, who would break--"
46:09;46:10;"As a Southern California rock band."
46:10;46:11;"What other band would break into the Eagles?"
46:11;46:12;"I'd love to know."
46:12;46:14;"Well, yeah, honestly, when you put it that way,"
46:14;46:17;"if any band busted into Hotel California,"
46:17;46:18;"I would respect it."
46:18;46:19;"I mean--"
46:19;46:22;"The only band I could see doing it is Phish."
46:22;46:23;"Just 'cause they're--"
46:23;46:24;"Right, okay."
46:24;46:25;"They're out there."
46:25;46:28;"Could you picture if like the Killers were like"
46:28;46:31;"headlining a festival for fun?"
46:31;46:33;"They might do like Hotel California or something."
46:33;46:36;"The Eagles just have no cool cred whatsoever."
46:36;46:37;"So--"
46:37;46:39;"Wait, have you guys already talked about why that is?"
46:39;46:40;"Like, have you guys--"
46:40;46:41;"No, no, no."
46:41;46:42;"--talked about it?"
46:42;46:43;"Yeah, let's get into it."
46:43;46:45;"Eagles talk starts now."
46:45;46:47;"I'm also just a huge Joe Walsh fan."
46:47;46:48;"I feel like that's when I--"
46:48;46:50;"Those are the songs I really love."
46:50;46:53;"But I also feel like that's an unpopular--"
46:53;46:56;"Or I don't know, maybe it's a popular opinion."
46:56;46:59;"I feel like Joe Walsh is the most popular of the Eagles."
46:59;47:00;"You think so?"
47:00;47:01;"Among--"
47:01;47:05;"Well, I think among like musicians and like rock fans,"
47:05;47:07;"at least the people I hang out with,"
47:07;47:08;"like no one's sort of like,"
47:08;47:10;"""Glenn Frey's so cool,"""
47:10;47:13;"or like, ""Don Henley seems like a real like chill dude."""
47:13;47:14;"But everyone--"
47:14;47:15;"I love Don Henley."
47:15;47:16;"I love Joe Walsh."
47:16;47:17;"I love Joe Walsh, too."
47:17;47:18;"I love them all."
47:18;47:19;"But I think Joe Walsh,"
47:19;47:23;"because maybe he has his like hard rock kind of like origins,"
47:23;47:25;"and then him being sort of like a wild child,"
47:25;47:30;"and like, I think he's like the most beloved of the Eagles."
47:30;47:32;"He's also like such a sick slide--"
47:32;47:33;"Yeah."
47:33;47:34;"--like, I love his guitar playing."
47:34;47:35;"Oh, yeah."
47:35;47:38;"It's crazy how much I really like truly in my bones"
47:38;47:40;"feel his guitar playing."
47:40;47:42;"What are your thoughts on Don Felder?"
47:42;47:43;"He's a little--"
47:43;47:44;"He held it down."
47:44;47:47;"I mean, no wonder he probably always had a chip on his shoulders."
47:47;47:49;"Like, he's like a great guitar player,"
47:49;47:52;"but then you got Joe Walsh."
47:52;47:55;"It's hard to place exactly what Felder's contribution was"
47:55;47:58;"because he also joined later."
47:58;47:59;"He was not a founding member."
47:59;48:02;"And he made the initial demo for Hotel California,"
48:02;48:04;"so he'll always have that."
48:04;48:05;"Yeah, Mexican--"
48:05;48:07;"Oh, I didn't know that."
48:07;48:09;"He called it Mexican reggae."
48:09;48:12;"[laughs]"
48:12;48:13;"Which is like a pretty accurate description."
48:13;48:17;"And then I guess whatever, Henley and Frye wrote the top line,"
48:17;48:19;"and him and Joe Walsh came up with the solo."
48:19;48:23;"I really love the Joe Walsh song that turned--"
48:23;48:27;"I think the story is it turned into an Eagles song, ""The City."""
48:27;48:29;"Oh, hell yeah."
48:29;48:32;"That song is a masterpiece."

49:38;49:40;"Ezra, if Vampire was gonna do an Eagles cover,"
49:40;49:42;"what would you guys do?"
49:42;49:46;"My gut would be kind of like similar to the songs you were throwing out, Jake,"
49:46;49:49;"is to do like a kind of country-ish song,"
49:49;49:52;"'cause I just feel like it would be kind of a fun way to like break up our set."
49:52;49:53;"Mm-hmm."
49:53;49:55;"Yeah, if we just bust it into like ""New Kid in Town"" or something."
49:55;49:59;"It's hard to make those songs pop live."
49:59;50:06;"You know what? I do feel like the recordings are so good."
50:06;50:07;"They're perfect."
50:07;50:09;"I remember seeing the Eagles documentary,"
50:09;50:12;"and I feel like-- what was it about?"
50:12;50:14;"The first producer. I forget his name."
50:14;50:16;"Oh, oh, Glynn Johns?"
50:16;50:19;"Glynn Johns. Like, weren't they like frustrated that--"
50:19;50:21;"like I remember, I feel like there was a part where like Don was like,"
50:21;50:24;"""I was frustrated that I couldn't mic every drum."""
50:24;50:25;"Right."
50:25;50:29;"Right? And he was like, ""Glynn was not into that."""
50:29;50:32;"Yeah, 'cause Glynn had done like-- had produced like ""The Who,"""
50:32;50:34;"which was like a loud rock band."
50:34;50:38;"Right. Kind of more trashy."
50:38;50:42;"And I feel like Eagles is the epitome of like hi-fi--"
50:42;50:43;"Anal."
50:43;50:45;"You know, anal."
50:45;50:48;"And like, yeah, and they don't-- they also-- like the Eagles don't rock."
50:48;50:51;"So it's like hard to make those songs--"
50:51;50:53;"that's what I found playing them a little bit,"
50:53;50:55;"- it was just like-- - They don't rock?"
50:55;50:57;"The Eagles don't rock."
50:57;50:59;"Like, do they groove?"
50:59;51:00;"They don't cook?"
51:00;51:03;"But what songs? I think you're talking about early Eagles, though."
51:03;51:06;"Like not-- like I'm talking-- like what about like ""Life in the Fast Lane""?"
51:06;51:08;"That rocks. That's Walsh. Yeah, you're right."
51:08;51:11;"I mean, that's one of the few songs that rocks, though."
51:11;51:13;"Like ""In the City"" rocks."
51:13;51:17;"And like, I guess ""Already Gone"" like kind of cooks."
51:17;51:18;"- But like-- - Right, no."
51:18;51:21;"I think we're talking-- like the thing when I think about the Eagles,"
51:21;51:23;"I don't think about the early sh*t."
51:23;51:25;"I think about the Joe Walsh sh*t. So it's like hard."
51:25;51:27;"But that's such a brief window."
51:27;51:29;"I guess, yeah, I'm just saying like ""Take It Easy"" is awesome."
51:29;51:31;"I love it, but it doesn't rock."
51:31;51:33;"- And it doesn't cook. - Absolutely not."
51:33;51:36;"- No, you're right. - And like ""Desperado"" is a ballad."
51:36;51:39;"Guys, what is the difference between rocking and cooking?"
51:39;51:42;"You know, if I could understand that distinction."
51:42;51:44;"I don't know. Please explain."
51:44;51:47;"I feel like cooking is sort of like boogie."
51:47;51:48;"- It's sort of like-- - Okay."
51:48;51:51;"I think cooking probably has more to do with like the rhythm section."
51:51;51:53;"- The groove. - Mm-hmm."
51:53;51:56;"'Cause like you could have a tasty groove that doesn't rock."
51:56;52:00;"I also like love the way Don Henley plays drums."
52:00;52:02;"- I feel that. - You're a drummer and a guitarist,"
52:02;52:06;"so I can imagine there's a lot for you to dive into in the Eagles catalog."
52:06;52:09;"I truly love the way he plays drums."
52:09;52:11;"Like I'm such a huge Don Henley fan."
52:11;52:13;"Okay, but I have a question for you 'cause like I feel like"
52:13;52:16;"you know classic rock playing so well and you do your thing with it."
52:16;52:19;"Do you have much of a relationship with like Southern rock?"
52:19;52:21;"Do you ever go through like an Allman Brothers phase?"
52:21;52:23;"- No. - Fair."
52:23;52:27;"And then my other question would be, you know, Southern California is not--"
52:27;52:31;"as we've discussed many times on the show, not really Jam Band territory."
52:31;52:35;"But did you have any relationship with Jerry and the Dead growing up?"
52:35;52:39;"No. I feel like really bad being on this show"
52:39;52:41;"and not really knowing much about the Grateful Dead."
52:41;52:43;"- I feel like that's-- - No, but there's not--"
52:43;52:45;"- I don't know there's no-- - No."
52:45;52:47;"- There's no malice in it. - Yeah."
52:47;52:50;"You didn't have any deadheads in your life growing up?"
52:50;52:52;"- No. - What about like--"
52:52;52:57;"You went to like a specialized music high school, right, in LA?"
52:57;53:00;"It's an arts high school. It's like all kind of--"
53:00;53:05;"You know, it's visual arts, dance, theater, vocal."
53:05;53:09;"And like would classical musician kids go there?"
53:09;53:12;"The music was like split into classical and then jazz."
53:12;53:16;"So at an urban LA performing arts high school--"
53:16;53:20;"- Yes. - --in the early 2000s, early to mid 2000s,"
53:20;53:23;"were there like hippies?"
53:23;53:26;"Was that a subculture that would exist in like that kind of milieu?"
53:26;53:31;"I wouldn't say hippies. I mean, people were super into totally different things."
53:31;53:34;"I mean, I feel like it was like the obvious."
53:34;53:39;"Like I was in high school from 2003 to 2007."
53:39;53:43;"And, you know, I just remember there was like a lot of--"
53:43;53:47;"Animal Collective was like huge, Cat Power."
53:47;53:49;"- Kind of like indie music. - Right."
53:49;53:51;"But I don't know. I don't think it was like--"
53:51;53:54;"Like what kind of hippies? Like into deadheads?"
53:54;53:57;"- Into the dead. - Yeah, I guess a deadhead or like--"
53:57;54:00;"- DMV? - DMV probably."
54:00;54:03;"Like that was-- I think that was a hard no."
54:03;54:07;"Even though I love DMV. But that was like a hard no."
54:07;54:10;"- No. - Not jam territory."
54:10;54:11;"- Not kind. - There you go."
54:11;54:16;"I mean, I also feel like everyone was just listening to like '60s music in like high school."
54:16;54:19;"- Like The Doors? - Maybe not The Doors. Like The Kinks."
54:19;54:22;"- Like cool stuff. - You know, people obviously were into Dylan."
54:22;54:25;"That was like the most obvious. I don't know."
54:25;54:28;"I feel like everyone's into Dylan in high school, right?"
54:28;54:30;"- No. - Really?"
54:30;54:32;"- There's always some kids-- - I don't know."
54:32;54:34;"And I guess you were specifically at Performing Arts High School."
54:34;54:38;"- But I get it. - Yeah, like, you know, also like Velvet Underground, huge."
54:38;54:41;"Wow, you went to the coolest high school ever."
54:41;54:45;"Where people liked Bob Dylan and the Velvet Underground, but not Dave Matthews."
54:45;54:49;"- That's the reverse of most high schools. - Yeah, no."
54:49;54:55;"Yeah, it was like very, you know, kids were plugged into some cool sh*t for sure."
54:55;55:00;"- Wow. - Well, it ain't no use sitting and wondering why, baby."
55:00;55:04;"Even you don't know by now."
55:04;55:09;"And it ain't no use sitting and wondering why, baby."
55:09;55:13;"It'll never do somehow."
55:13;55:18;"When your rooster crows at the break of dawn."
55:18;55:22;"Look out your window and I'll be gone."
55:22;55:26;"You're the reason I'm a-traveling on."
55:26;55:30;"But don't think twice, it's alright."
55:30;55:32;"What about like SoCal, like Blink-182?"
55:32;55:35;"- Like, was that big in your high school? - That was in middle school."
55:35;55:41;"- Okay, earlier. - Yeah, that was like very..."
55:41;55:45;"- Yeah, like Blink, like Nu Metal. - That was a little earlier."
55:45;55:48;"- Well, that was like 2000. - Sure."
55:48;55:49;"2001."
55:49;55:53;"And this is, actually we were talking about this with Ariel recently."
55:53;55:59;"Ariel was showing me and Danielle some pretty sick live footage of Sublime."
55:59;56:02;"- It was like a concert. - That was incredible."
56:02;56:05;"They sounded really good. I was pretty shocked."
56:05;56:09;"And like the vibe was great, like shirts off, you know."
56:09;56:12;"Just like boxers sticking out of cargo shorts."
56:12;56:16;"- Brad just like slight gut. - Sick look."
56:16;56:21;"I couldn't believe that they were like figuring out Bad Fish like on stage, just jamming it out."
56:21;56:24;"Like before the lyrics are really pinned down."
56:24;56:30;"This is before their final album, so I guess some of these songs they were playing for the first time."
56:30;56:35;"Like, they were playing that song ""Caress Me Down"", which is..."
56:35;56:38;"- Jake, do you know all these songs? - No."
56:38;56:40;"I don't go deep, but respect."
56:40;56:44;"There's a lyric, a juvenile lyric in that song."
56:44;56:48;"It talks about a girl pulling out his mushroom tip."
56:48;56:53;"And then he says, ""I didn't know she had that G.I. Joe Kung Fu grip."""
56:53;56:58;"So that's kind of like a classic, goofy, Sublime lyric."
56:58;57:03;"In the one that we were watching, because they're kind of just like figuring it out,"
57:03;57:06;"he's kind of half repeating lyrics the whole time."
57:06;57:10;"He references his mushroom tip in this live version maybe seven times."
57:10;57:14;"But yeah, I thought that footage was like pretty incredible and it was such a vibe."
57:14;57:19;"And you kind of got this sense about how, obviously, on the live side,"
57:19;57:23;"Sublime never got to go as big as their records did."
57:23;57:28;"Because, tragically, the singer Brad died the week the breakthrough album came out."
57:28;57:31;"- Just like absolutely brutal timing. - They were playing like the Palace Theater,"
57:31;57:34;"which is like a very... It's like, I don't even know what the capacity is."
57:34;57:37;"- Like a thousand? - A few hundred? A thousand at most?"
57:37;57:39;"Yeah, I don't even know. Probably less than that."
57:39;57:44;"One thought that I had when we were watching this video of Sublime live,"
57:44;57:47;"if Brad hadn't died, obviously they would have gone on to..."
57:47;57:51;"They easily could have played arenas. They became one of the big bands of the 90s."
57:51;57:56;"But then I started to wonder, because there's this weird way in which Sublime..."
57:56;57:58;"Somebody might get mad at me saying this, but like,"
57:58;58:03;"culturally to Southern California is almost like the dead to Northern California."
58:03;58:06;"And, you know, famously Sublime covered Scarlet Begonia,"
58:06;58:08;"so there's like a slight connection."
58:08;58:11;"I will definitely say Sublime was huge in my middle school,"
58:11;58:16;"and for sure people f***ed with it in my high school."
58:16;58:18;"It's like real SoCal cultural music."
58:18;58:23;"I mean, my question is, is there a universe in which 20 years later,"
58:23;58:29;"Sublime would have kept growing, building this kind of like chill out, stoner,"
58:29;58:34;"get f***ed up at the show culture, and that maybe 20 years down the line,"
58:34;58:40;"you would have been like, ""Oh yeah, Sublime, they did a three-day festival in Riverside."
58:40;58:43;"You know, 100,000 people."" Like full-on jam band s***."
58:43;58:47;"Do you think Sublime could have become this like cultural, like,"
58:47;58:50;"""Oh yeah, man, I follow Sublime on tour,"" type thing?"
58:50;58:53;"I think so. I mean, I don't really know a lot about 311,"
58:53;58:57;"but isn't that kind of their deal, or no?"
58:57;59:01;"Yes. 311 has really hardcore fans, and I think they have like a cruise,"
59:01;59:06;"and I think every year on March 11, the fans converge,"
59:06;59:09;"maybe to Vegas for like a big show."
59:09;59:10;"Yes, Las Vegas."
59:10;59:13;"That was one of the last shows before COVID shut everything down,"
59:13;59:15;"was the 311 fest."
59:15;59:21;"Friend of the show, Phil Matariz, goes every year, and that was his last concert."
59:21;59:25;"I just feel like maybe Sublime's more, I hope I don't get in trouble for saying this,"
59:25;59:28;"but like definitely more culturally relevant than 311."
59:28;59:33;"I think Sublime is just bigger. Like 311, obviously, we're all so beloved."
59:33;59:38;"311 produced at least a few like classic rock radio songs,"
59:38;59:43;"like ""Amber"" and ""Down"" from the first album."
59:43;59:46;"But yeah, I'm sure 311 would have no problem admitting that like"
59:46;59:49;"that final Sublime album is just like a juggernaut."
59:49;59:54;"It's basically the white reggae nevermind of the '90s, just like a massive..."
59:54;59:56;"With Seinfeld, how much did that sell?"
59:56;01:00:01;"It sold over 5 million copies in the US by the end of the '90s."
01:00:01;01:00:06;"Oh, so that 20 years ago, it must be like 10 million now, plus the streams."
01:00:06;01:00:09;"You think it sold 5 million copies in the last 20 years?"
01:00:09;01:00:12;"That sounds like, I don't know, it sounds right to me."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"Interesting."
01:00:13;01:00:15;"It kept getting bigger and bigger."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"Yeah, true, true."
01:00:17;01:00:22;"Can you guys think of another band since Sublime that had national popularity"
01:00:22;01:00:27;"like they did but also was still in a way truly like a regional band?"
01:00:27;01:00:32;"I remember going to college and I went to college in '95, I think,"
01:00:32;01:00:37;"and I'd heard a song or two on MTV, but then I remember meeting all these kids"
01:00:37;01:00:43;"from SoCal that were going to school in Oregon, and they were all like Sublime heads."
01:00:43;01:00:47;"I remember them being like, ""I'm from SoCal, man, everyone loves Sublime."""
01:00:47;01:00:50;"And I just remember being like, ""Whoa, that really is like a regional band."""
01:00:50;01:00:52;"Is there another rock band that--"
01:00:52;01:00:55;"I have a very strong-- I don't know if this answers your question."
01:00:55;01:00:58;"Well, it does answer your question, but I just remember having a very strong--"
01:00:58;01:01:05;"like every time there'd be a guitar out at a party, I feel like everyone would play Santa Maria."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"Right."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"Did anyone else have that experience?"
01:01:08;01:01:09;"Yeah."
01:01:09;01:01:12;"Jake, what about the strokes? Does that count?"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"Yeah, like New York?"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"Or does New York just not count?"
01:01:16;01:01:21;"I feel like how random our perception-- just your timing and your place with these things"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"and your perceptions of them."
01:01:23;01:01:27;"For some reason, I just somehow missed Sublime being a huge national band,"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"and I only heard about it from people from SoCal."
01:01:29;01:01:33;"Whereas the strokes, to me, just arrived, fully formed, boom,"
01:01:33;01:01:36;"it was just like a full-on national assault."
01:01:36;01:01:40;"I didn't feel like the strokes had been grinding it out in New York for years."
01:01:40;01:01:43;"I didn't feel like there was a lot of backstory with the strokes."
01:01:43;01:01:48;"And that's a good point. And also that has to do with the changing nature of marketing"
01:01:48;01:01:54;"and the record business, because Sublime was played on K-Rock in LA."
01:01:54;01:02:02;"They were legitimately a big band getting radio play in their hometown or close to their hometown."
01:02:02;01:02:06;"So there truly could be somebody growing up in LA who'd be like,"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"""Sublime's huge. I hear them on the radio all the time."""
01:02:08;01:02:11;"And there could have been somebody in Connecticut or New Jersey who'd say,"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"""I've never heard of this band in my life."""
01:02:13;01:02:16;"So I don't know if that phenomenon could even exist today."
01:02:16;01:02:20;"It makes me think of another LA band, Fishbone. You know that band?"
01:02:20;01:02:23;"Oh yeah, great band. I really got into them."
01:02:23;01:02:24;"You never really got in?"
01:02:24;01:02:28;"Well, they were like 80s. They started in the 80s."
01:02:28;01:02:32;"Huge, huge locally. One of those bands that was sort of like,"
01:02:32;01:02:35;"""Oh, maybe they're going to really make it and be a huge national act."""
01:02:35;01:02:40;"And they sort of were, but they were by far the hugest here."
01:02:40;01:02:44;"I had a friend, my friend, Nicole Montan, who..."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"Shout out to Nicole Montan."
01:02:45;01:02:48;"She grew up in the suburbs of Chicago."
01:02:48;01:02:53;"And she would come out every summer to LA to visit her dad."
01:02:53;01:02:59;"And every year she'd tell us about what's happening in the music scene in Chicago."
01:02:59;01:03:00;"And I remember..."
01:03:00;01:03:01;"That's tight."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"I think it was Fall Out Boy."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"I don't really know a lot about Fall Out Boy."
01:03:05;01:03:08;"I feel like they were very Midwest."
01:03:08;01:03:11;"Super regional, because I hadn't heard about it."
01:03:11;01:03:12;"Yeah."
01:03:12;01:03:15;"And then they blew up to another level."
01:03:15;01:03:16;"Yeah."
01:03:16;01:03:21;"We're basically describing the end of the music industry before the internet."
01:03:21;01:03:24;"Because now it would just be like, everyone would hear about it at the same time."
01:03:24;01:03:28;"But before the internet was disseminating music so easily,"
01:03:28;01:03:32;"you still had that sort of, like, your friend from Chicago telling you about..."
01:03:32;01:03:33;"Right."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"I think a similar phenomenon..."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"The local band."
01:03:35;01:03:38;"I think Outkast is a similar phenomenon."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"Right?"
01:03:39;01:03:44;"Like, if you know, they were this huge group in Atlanta in the South."
01:03:44;01:03:48;"But yet no one on the East or the West Coast really knew or accepted them."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"You know, and there's that famous..."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"Yeah."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"If the Source Awards were their booed off."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"Right."
01:03:54;01:03:55;"You know, for album of the year."
01:03:55;01:03:59;"But similarly, like, you can't imagine now how something could get that big"
01:03:59;01:04:03;"and have no one else coastally know that."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"That couldn't happen."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"I love this idea of a regional band."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"Because we're a regional band."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"[Laughter]"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"We're staying in our town."
01:04:50;01:05:04;"I wonder if, like, post-COVID, there might be some rise of, like,"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"the truly regional band."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"I mean, also, it's just like..."
01:05:08;01:05:10;"Regional band."
01:05:10;01:05:12;"[Laughter]"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"That's a Mountain Brew song."
01:05:14;01:05:17;"The concept of, like, scenes barely exists."
01:05:17;01:05:22;"Like, when Vampire Weekend came out, whether or not we truly felt like we were"
01:05:22;01:05:25;"a part of it, we would get written about in terms of being, like,"
01:05:25;01:05:28;"part of a scene of New York bands."
01:05:28;01:05:29;"Right."
01:05:29;01:05:32;"You know, which was always kind of funny because New York's a huge city."
01:05:32;01:05:34;"There's always a million bands and musicians."
01:05:34;01:05:36;"But maybe there's something to it."
01:05:36;01:05:40;"There's, like, people roughly the same generation putting out music,"
01:05:40;01:05:42;"all living in the same city."
01:05:42;01:05:43;"You know, it's kind of a thing."
01:05:43;01:05:46;"But I feel like even a few years later, like,"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"I feel like when the first Time record came out,"
01:05:48;01:05:51;"my impression was not a lot of, like, people being like,"
01:05:51;01:05:53;"""Here's what's going on in the L.A. scene."""
01:05:53;01:05:56;"It's like, you guys are just kind of doing your own thing, you know?"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"Guys, I got one."
01:05:57;01:06:01;"What about, like, Canadian indie rock bands like Arcade Fire,"
01:06:01;01:06:04;"which was so associated with Montreal or, like, Broken Specialty?"
01:06:04;01:06:05;"Oh, yeah. That was the thing."
01:06:05;01:06:08;"Yeah, being so, like, Wolf Parade."
01:06:08;01:06:09;"Yeah, all that sh*t."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:06:10;01:06:12;"That was, like, early 2000s."
01:06:12;01:06:13;"That was the end of it."
01:06:13;01:06:14;"True."
01:06:14;01:06:15;"I guess the scene is dead, guys."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"Damn."
01:06:16;01:06:18;"You know, we did an episode where we were talking about, like,"
01:06:18;01:06:20;"could there be a Guided by Voices today?"
01:06:20;01:06:23;"Just, like, a kind of, like, person,"
01:06:23;01:06:25;"a totally unknown person recording all this music."
01:06:25;01:06:28;"And people emailed us, like, ""Oh, yeah, here's an artist, too."""
01:06:28;01:06:29;"Right."
01:06:29;01:06:32;"I'm sure there's, like, plenty of Bob Pollards and Jandex"
01:06:32;01:06:35;"and just, like, people making, like, their own music."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"But, yeah, truly, like, a scene,"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"hmm, I guess that's dead."
01:06:39;01:06:42;"Or we're just older and, like, removed."
01:06:42;01:06:45;"I mean, there's probably, like, someone who's, like, 20 years old"
01:06:45;01:06:47;"listening to this banging their head against the wall being like,"
01:06:47;01:06:51;"""Dude, my band and all my friends' bands play shows all the time,"
01:06:51;01:06:52;"and we have a scene."""
01:06:52;01:06:53;"Right."
01:06:53;01:06:55;"I think this is smaller,"
01:06:55;01:06:59;"but I think, like, when No Age and The Smell happened,"
01:06:59;01:07:00;"that was, like, a very LA time."
01:07:00;01:07:01;"We played a show with No Age."
01:07:01;01:07:03;"Oh, really? Like, an early Haim show?"
01:07:03;01:07:07;"The lineup was No Age, Mika Mika, Abe Vigoda,"
01:07:07;01:07:09;"and then we opened."
01:07:09;01:07:10;"Wow."
01:07:10;01:07:12;"Oh, yeah, Abe Vigoda, great band."
01:07:12;01:07:14;"Yeah, this was in 2000."
01:07:14;01:07:15;"I just looked it up."
01:07:15;01:07:16;"There's a flyer for it."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"I think it was '09."
01:07:17;01:07:18;"Wow."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"Oh, yeah, this was June 8, 2008."
01:07:20;01:07:24;"No Age, Mika Mika, Abe Vigoda, and Haim at The Smell."
01:07:24;01:07:25;"Whoa."
01:07:25;01:07:27;"What were you guys playing in 2008?"
01:07:27;01:07:30;"'Cause that's five years before your first album came out, right?"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"Like, did you have some of those songs?"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"Were you, like, playing The Wire?"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"I think that was the year we wrote The Wire."
01:07:36;01:07:38;"So, probably."
01:07:38;01:07:41;"So you probably would have been playing some songs at The Smell"
01:07:41;01:07:44;"that would go on to be on the first record."
01:07:44;01:07:46;"Probably just The Wire made it."
01:07:46;01:07:48;"Wow, that's wild."
01:07:48;01:07:50;"Yeah, I know. It was cool."
01:07:50;01:07:53;"I mean, for us to be a part of that,"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"I remember feeling a little bit like, ""Wow."""
01:07:55;01:07:57;"Like, The Smell-- I would go to The Smell all the time,"
01:07:57;01:08:01;"and, like, it was such a cool community."
01:08:01;01:08:03;"It did feel like, ""Whoa,"" like, I couldn't believe"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"that we somehow got on the show."
01:08:05;01:08:07;"Did you ever have, like, a punk rock phase?"
01:08:07;01:08:10;"[laughs]"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"What do you mean?"
01:08:12;01:08:13;"Well, I guess I'm thinking--"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"Like, when we're talking about, like, scenes,"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"just, like, growing up, did you ever have a phase"
01:08:17;01:08:20;"of, like, identifying with a subgenre of music"
01:08:20;01:08:23;"that involved, like, the way you dressed"
01:08:23;01:08:26;"or how you identified or, like, the shows you went to?"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"Probably not, and that's maybe why, like,"
01:08:28;01:08:31;"I don't feel like we were part of any sort of, like--"
01:08:31;01:08:35;"Like, we kind of just floated around different scenes in L.A."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"You know what I mean?"
01:08:36;01:08:39;"Like, we played The Smell, like, probably three times."
01:08:39;01:08:42;"Yeah, probably, again, that kind of scene culture"
01:08:42;01:08:44;"was just fundamentally different."
01:08:44;01:08:47;"I mean, Jake and I talk a lot about the days between,"
01:08:47;01:08:51;"which is the years between when Jake was born in 1977"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"and I was born in 1984,"
01:08:53;01:08:58;"and you, I believe, were born same year as Taylor Swift, 1989."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"Yep."
01:08:59;01:09:03;"It's funny, these micro-generations, '77, '84, '89,"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"we have a lot of shared heritage,"
01:09:05;01:09:06;"we love a lot of the same music,"
01:09:06;01:09:09;"but just these very subtle differences"
01:09:09;01:09:12;"and just, like, the kind of space that we first entered."
01:09:12;01:09:13;"Yeah."
01:09:13;01:09:14;"I don't know if we were part of a scene."
01:09:14;01:09:16;"I think we just kind of--"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"We would go out and just ask friends, like,"
01:09:18;01:09:20;"""Hey, can we open up for you?"""
01:09:20;01:09:21;"That was basically how we--"
01:09:21;01:09:23;"And, like, we had a MySpace,"
01:09:23;01:09:25;"so bookers would, like, get in touch with us"
01:09:25;01:09:28;"through MySpace, and that's how we'd kind of book gigs."
01:09:28;01:09:30;"But we didn't headline our own show"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"until after ""South By."""
01:09:33;01:09:35;"Like, we never headlined in L.A."
01:09:35;01:09:37;"Like, nobody wanted to give us a night."
01:09:37;01:09:38;"Wow."
01:09:38;01:09:39;"Yeah."
01:09:39;01:09:40;"2003 to 2007,"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"maybe it's 'cause, like, I was in college then,"
01:09:42;01:09:43;"you know, and it's like--"
01:09:43;01:09:44;"Yeah."
01:09:44;01:09:45;"Kind of when you're in college, you're just--"
01:09:45;01:09:46;"I don't know."
01:09:46;01:09:47;"At least back then,"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"I just kind of felt like I was in this weird nebulous phase,"
01:09:49;01:09:52;"like, a little checked out from, like,"
01:09:52;01:09:54;"the culture that you might experience"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"when you're, like, in high school and not--"
01:09:56;01:09:57;"I don't know."
01:09:57;01:09:58;"There's something about that--"
01:09:58;01:10:03;"2003 to 2007 seems like such a bizarre time in culture."
01:10:03;01:10:04;"I mean, you were younger,"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"so you must have fond memories."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Do you agree that it was kind of weird?"
01:10:08;01:10:12;"There was definitely some, like, pop culture stuff"
01:10:12;01:10:13;"that, like, I definitely, like,"
01:10:13;01:10:16;"wasn't necessarily, like, buying into."
01:10:16;01:10:17;"I mean, you know,"
01:10:17;01:10:19;"it's truly a strange transitional time."
01:10:19;01:10:21;"I mean, I think I've said this on the show before,"
01:10:21;01:10:24;"but it's funny that those are your high school years"
01:10:24;01:10:27;"because I've always been specifically interested"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"in the year 2004."
01:10:29;01:10:30;"Great year."
01:10:30;01:10:31;"Was that a good year?"
01:10:31;01:10:34;"Well, I mean, speaking of OutKast,"
01:10:34;01:10:35;"I mean, I love--"
01:10:35;01:10:37;"I think it was '03, but I think they won--"
01:10:37;01:10:38;"No, no, you're right."
01:10:38;01:10:41;"They won the Grammy for Album of the Year that year,"
01:10:41;01:10:45;"which kind of seemed like a culmination of sorts"
01:10:45;01:10:46;"to have kind of, like,"
01:10:46;01:10:51;"this, like, experimental, adventurous hip-hop album"
01:10:51;01:10:53;"get, like, this big honor."
01:10:53;01:10:56;"And then basically within this, like, two-month period,"
01:10:56;01:10:59;"'cause that would have been in, like, February or something,"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"you had OutKast won Album of the Year,"
01:11:01;01:11:04;"the final Lord of the Rings movie won Best Picture"
01:11:04;01:11:05;"at the Oscars,"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"which seems, like, appropriately random"
01:11:07;01:11:10;"for the era of culture we were entering."
01:11:10;01:11:13;"But also you have Kanye's first album came out,"
01:11:13;01:11:14;"like, a couple months after that,"
01:11:14;01:11:18;"and you also had Mark Zuckerberg launch Facebook"
01:11:18;01:11:21;"in his dorm at Harvard, all within a few months."
01:11:21;01:11:23;"And there's something about all of those events--"
01:11:23;01:11:24;"I guess you could do this with anything."
01:11:24;01:11:26;"We could probably literally just pull out, like,"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"an encyclopedia and just be like,"
01:11:28;01:11:29;"""January '66,"""
01:11:29;01:11:31;"and we'd kind of be like, ""Whoa, here's four events"
01:11:31;01:11:34;"and what they say about where culture was heading."""
01:11:34;01:11:35;"But there's just--"
01:11:35;01:11:36;"It always struck me,"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"something about Kanye's first album"
01:11:38;01:11:43;"and Zuckerberg starting Facebook in 2004"
01:11:43;01:11:44;"at the exact same time,"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"and then to think about how, like,"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"both Kanye and Zuckerberg turned out to be"
01:11:48;01:11:52;"these, like, very fascinating, divisive,"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"but ultimately influential figures."
01:11:54;01:11:57;"So I had this, like, weird feeling, like,"
01:11:57;01:12:02;"a new era was quite literally born in 2004."
01:12:02;01:12:03;"- That's interesting."
01:12:03;01:12:05;"- 2004 was also kind of like"
01:12:05;01:12:07;"when, like, reality show culture"
01:12:07;01:12:09;"was, like, really starting to take hold."
01:12:09;01:12:10;"- Right."
01:12:10;01:12:11;"- Isn't there an Instagram account"
01:12:11;01:12:13;"or a Tumblr or something called"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"""Pop Culture Died in 2004""?"
01:12:15;01:12:16;"""SignFolk, I Get a Number Crunch."""
01:12:16;01:12:18;"Is that a real account?"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"- It sounds real, but let me confirm here."
01:12:20;01:12:21;"While I do, I should also point out"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"that the movie ""Napoleon Dynamite"""
01:12:23;01:12:24;"came out in 2004."
01:12:24;01:12:25;"- Oh, yeah."
01:12:25;01:12:26;"- That was huge."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"- It was also the year that Janet Jackson"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"had the Super Bowl,"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"the Justin Timberlake wardrobe malfunction."
01:12:32;01:12:35;"- Also, Britney Spears' ""Toxic."""
01:12:35;01:12:36;"- Was 2004?"
01:12:36;01:12:37;"- Yeah."
01:12:37;01:12:38;"- Yeah, that was huge."
01:12:38;01:12:39;"- That was a pretty big turning point event"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"for, like, the thing you were talking about before,"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"how people talked about pop music."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"I mean, that's a great song."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"She has a lot of great songs,"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"and there's something specifically about ""Toxic"""
01:12:48;01:12:50;"that I feel like was this moment of people being like--"
01:12:50;01:12:51;"- Everyone agreed with, like,"
01:12:51;01:12:53;"that it was, like, a next-level song, right?"
01:12:53;01:12:54;"Is that what you were about to say?"
01:12:54;01:12:57;"- Yes, and I think also because Britney Spears--"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"because her first single was, like,"
01:12:59;01:13:00;"""Hit Me Baby One More Time,"""
01:13:00;01:13:02;"which was also a very interesting song"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"but so easy for people to write off,"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"just, like, this is just some Swedish,"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"like, over-the-top, goofy sh--,"
01:13:08;01:13:09;"and there's something about ""Toxic"""
01:13:09;01:13:11;"that felt like a turning point in her career"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"and also maybe just generally"
01:13:13;01:13:15;"in how people--a certain type of person--"
01:13:15;01:13:19;"- You're talking to, like, a huge Britney head."
01:13:19;01:13:22;"Like, I've always loved her since the jump, so..."
01:13:22;01:13:24;"- Ezra, the Instagram account you're thinking of"
01:13:24;01:13:27;"is called ""Pop Culture Died in 2009."""
01:13:27;01:13:29;"- Oh. 2009. - Really? What?"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"- '09. - That doesn't make any sense to me."
01:13:31;01:13:33;"What happened in 2009?"
01:13:33;01:13:34;"Yeah, no, I guess you're right."
01:13:34;01:13:36;"- Isn't that when ""Vampire Weekend"" came out?"
01:13:36;01:13:40;"- Well, our first--our first album was 2008,"
01:13:40;01:13:43;"so we got one year before pop culture died."
01:13:43;01:13:45;"- Okay. - No, okay, you're right."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"Seinfeld's right. It's ""Pop Culture Died in 2009,"""
01:13:47;01:13:50;"but the culture that they cover"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"is, like, the eight years before,"
01:13:52;01:13:55;"which is, like, Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton,"
01:13:55;01:13:58;"like, that era of, like, kind of tabloid celebrity."
01:13:58;01:14:00;"There's just something so strange about--"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"between the way culture was shifting"
01:14:02;01:14:05;"and the birth of social media and the Internet,"
01:14:05;01:14:07;"it does kind of feel like"
01:14:07;01:14:09;"something strange started then"
01:14:09;01:14:11;"and we're still living in the--"
01:14:11;01:14:13;"- Right. I feel like it was also, like,"
01:14:13;01:14:15;"2004 is the year before"
01:14:15;01:14:17;"the third Strokes album came out, right?"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"- That sounds right, yeah, 'cause their first record"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"is 2001."
01:14:21;01:14:23;"- And then the next one came out, like, the next year,"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"right? Or two years?"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"- Yeah, that sounds right. Yeah, I think you're right."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"- I feel like anything, like, post-Strokes,"
01:14:29;01:14:32;"like, in alternative rock world, like, felt--"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"so anything that was kind of referencing,"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"I feel like the Strokes just felt"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"old news to me or something. I don't know."
01:14:38;01:14:40;"If that makes any--"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"- One way of thinking of it would be, like, the Strokes felt"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"like this, like, last gasp of, like,"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"people being excited about rock music."
01:14:46;01:14:48;"- Yeah. - And obviously, there's been"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"bands since then that people have been into,"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"I hope, but"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"I feel like the Strokes was kind of the last time"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"somebody--like, people could unironically be like,"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"""There's a great new rock band."""
01:14:58;01:15:00;"After them, it was kind of like,"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"you might call it indie"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"or you might be into a band,"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"but just, like, a true"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"rock band, like, no questions asked."
01:15:08;01:15:10;"Just a great new rock band."
01:15:10;01:15:12;"That feels like that was kind of the final moment"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"of it. I've never really studied"
01:15:14;01:15:16;"2014, but I do"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"have this feeling, like, number four years"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"are interesting, 'cause '94 was"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"big. That's, like, O.J."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"and all that stuff. - Okay."
01:15:24;01:15:26;"- I don't know what happened in 2014, but"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"I would definitely keep my eyes"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"peeled for what's gonna happen in 2024,"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"'cause that's gonna be weird. The full"
01:15:32;01:15:34;"20-year cycle after the year"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"that Facebook and Kanye launched,"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"I have no idea what it's gonna mean,"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"but it's, like, it's a little spooky."
01:15:40;01:15:42;"Maybe it was off a little bit."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"Maybe it's--well, clearly 2016,"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"it was, like, a famously strange transitional"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"year. So maybe it was, you know,"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"12 years later,"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"off by two. Makes sense."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"Danielle, one last question before you go."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"- Okay."
01:15:56;01:15:58;"- Are you a fan of Hershey's Peanut Butter Cups?"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"- Am I a fan? - Oh, I'm sorry."
01:16:00;01:16:02;"Are you a fan of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups? - Yes."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"- Do you find that they taste different"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"in different seasons? - I feel"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"like the softness"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"changes."
01:16:10;01:16:12;"- The softness of the chocolate? - Of the"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"whole, kind of, inner"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"part of the"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"cup, if you will."
01:16:18;01:16:20;"- Right. Yeah, the peanut butter?"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"Okay. Interesting."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"- Well, not, like, only the inner. I'm talking--of the"
01:16:24;01:16:26;"circle. Like, the middle of the--I guess"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"just, like, the middle of the-- - Oh. Like, the"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"top? - Yeah, like, all of it."
01:16:30;01:16:32;"I feel like they're harder to, kind of, eat"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"in, like, the winter. But I think it's just"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"because it's, like, it's hotter"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"in the summer. It's just, like, kind of breaks apart"
01:16:38;01:16:40;"easier. - Mm-hmm."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"This blows up your entire theory."
01:16:42;01:16:44;"- Right. That's not exac--yeah. - How many"
01:16:44;01:16:46;"Reese's Pieces are you eating a year,"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"Danielle? - Wait, Reese's Pieces?"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"- Sorry, sorry. Cups. Cups. Proper"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"cups. Thank you for clarifying."
01:16:52;01:16:54;"- Um, a year? I don't know."
01:16:54;01:16:56;"I mean, I feel like during Halloween,"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"it's kind of, like, maybe"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"a pack. - All bets are off. - A few."
01:17:00;01:17:02;"But you know what? I don't like the small ones."
01:17:02;01:17:04;"- Right."
01:17:04;01:17:06;"- Oh, interesting. - You're talking about the classic two-pack"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"cup. - I'm talking about the classic"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"two-pack. - Well, what about Butterfingers?"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"- Not a Butterfinger fan."
01:17:12;01:17:14;"Sorry."
01:17:14;01:17:16;"- Do you find them, like, disgusting? Or are you just, like,"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"not for me? - Fair. - Just not for me."
01:17:18;01:17:20;"- All right. Fair enough. Well, thank you so much,"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"Danielle, for coming through. Hope you'll come"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"back soon. - Anytime you want."
01:17:24;01:17:26;"- See you soon. Thanks for coming on TC. - Bye!"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"- Peace. - I love ending an interview"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"with, like, a really sort of tepid,"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"""Where do you stand on a candy?"""
01:17:32;01:17:34;"And they're just like, ""I like it."" Okay."
01:17:34;01:17:36;"Thank you."
01:17:36;01:17:38;"- No context whatsoever."
01:17:38;01:17:40;"- No context."
01:17:40;01:17:42;"- That's, like,"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"real TV stuff."
01:17:44;01:17:46;"It's like, a lot of times when people"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"do, like, real professional interviews,"
01:17:48;01:17:50;"it's like, you kind of get through the dry"
01:17:50;01:17:52;"stuff early, and then you're like, ""All right, let's end"
01:17:52;01:17:54;"with some fun stuff. Let me ask you"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"some fun sh*t on Time Crisis."""
01:17:56;01:17:58;"It's like, talk about whatever you want, and then"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"at the end, just get, like, a really boring"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"question. - Yeah. We've always,"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"like... We've been making"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"you comfortable just to have the"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"most boring part of the conversation."
01:18:08;01:18:10;"- Yeah, I mean, just like,"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"we've never nailed down the"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"TC Proust questionnaire."
01:18:14;01:18:16;"But there really is something. Like,"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"talking to Danielle about her, like, middle"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"school, high school years, it is funny"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"to me. There's something about that era"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"that just haunts me."
01:18:24;01:18:26;"That 2004."
01:18:26;01:18:28;"I really thought pop culture died"
01:18:28;01:18:30;"in 2004. I'm fascinated that it's"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"actually died in 2009."
01:18:34;01:18:43;"You did me so bad when I was in the moment Well, I didn't understand, ooh, yeah"
01:18:43;01:18:51;"You did me so harsh, left me low with my high heels In the parking lot, always thought I'd see it comin'"
01:18:51;01:18:59;"Mm, but I don't Gotta leave the engine runnin' In the front seat in my mama's winter coat"
01:18:59;01:19:08;"I don't wanna give up on you I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna have to"
01:19:08;01:19:12;"Well, we both had nights Wakin' up at strangers' beds"
01:19:12;01:19:17;"But I don't wanna, don't wanna, I don't wanna give a bitch"
01:19:17;01:19:24;"Anyways, we did get some emails from people. Basically, we can't get to the bottom of this Reese's thing."
01:19:24;01:19:31;"Maybe I'm the only true believer, but we got a few emails from listeners. We got one from Mariana Fierro,"
01:19:31;01:19:36;"who said, ""I'm no chemist here, but my family lives in Italy, where there are no Reese's cups,"
01:19:36;01:19:42;"and I figure my mom might have had some still from last fall/winter, the last time she was in the US."""
01:19:42;01:19:48;"So, you know, the Italian family, they come and grab a bunch before they go back, so they probably don't burn through them as quickly."
01:19:48;01:19:57;"And so basically, she asked her mom in Italy to take pictures of some of the older cups they had,"
01:19:57;01:20:04;"and she did find the one from July 2020 and the one from October 2019 had different..."
01:20:04;01:20:11;"The ingredients are the same, but they had different percentages of, like, things like potassium and stuff."
01:20:11;01:20:22;"I mean, this seems pretty notable to me, that the 2019 Reese's cup had 39 mg of calcium and 150 mg of potassium."
01:20:22;01:20:31;"And then the numbers changed for July 2020. It's down to 29 mg of calcium and 110 mg of potassium."
01:20:31;01:20:32;"That seems like something."
01:20:32;01:20:39;"But then we also got an email from a professional chocolate maker and a big TC head named Kevin."
01:20:39;01:20:50;"It kind of seemed like the upshot of his email was that he didn't really think there was any reason why they would actually be changing the formula seasonally."
01:20:50;01:20:57;"He just didn't think it would actually make sense, and he says there isn't really a practical way to make chocolate less prone to melting,"
01:20:57;01:21:00;"so he thinks it's probably the same. He did say some interesting things, that"
01:21:00;01:21:09;"there's a very interesting history of the US military contracting Hershey's to formulate and manufacture chocolate bars that don't melt at high temperatures for
soldiers' rations."
01:21:09;01:21:17;"So, the idea that the military-industrial complex has ever expressed an interest in chocolate melting,"
01:21:17;01:21:20;"that opens up some interesting pathways to me."
01:21:20;01:21:22;"And he also talks about..."
01:21:22;01:21:26;"Okay, this is so deep. We gotta go deep on this some other time, but basically, he talks about how..."
01:21:26;01:21:29;"Yeah, that email is almost worth reading another episode."
01:21:29;01:21:31;"We'll go deep on that in the future."
01:21:31;01:21:36;"And then we also got a couple emails from people with connections to Australia,"
01:21:36;01:21:45;"such as Michael and Zoe, who talked about the fact that Cadbury's, the English chocolate maker, sells some of the same products in Australia,"
01:21:45;01:21:48;"but people pointed out that they taste different."
01:21:48;01:21:58;"Like, hardcore Cadbury's heads who are familiar with the UK flavors have said that supposedly the same chocolate in Australia tastes different."
01:21:58;01:22:08;"And, a lot of people started to spread a rumor that it was because, down in hot Australia, baking, underneath the hole in the ozone layer,"
01:22:08;01:22:12;"that Cadbury was adding anti-melting chemicals."
01:22:12;01:22:17;"And people started to really believe that the Cadbury's taste different down there because of the anti-melting chemicals."
01:22:17;01:22:23;"And then Cadbury came out and said, ""No, no, no. That's not the case at all. It's just because we use different milk."""
01:22:23;01:22:27;"Which, I don't know. Would different milk really make it taste that different?"
01:22:27;01:22:34;"Well, from Kevin's email, when the US military was trying to engineer chocolate that didn't melt, it tasted terrible."
01:22:34;01:22:37;"Right. So that was Kevin's point, was that you can't do it."
01:22:37;01:22:39;"Chocolate's gonna melt."
01:22:39;01:22:46;"Unless they figured out a way to make chocolate not melt, that would somehow be very disturbing to the general population."
01:22:46;01:22:52;"Let's say they used all these chemicals to make chocolate not melt. It tasted terrible. Nobody wanted it."
01:22:52;01:23:02;"And then somebody said, ""Realize, if we grind up cockroaches really finely, you can barely taste it. Only a supertaster can taste it."
01:23:02;01:23:07;"And it makes the chocolate not melt."" Then they might be incentivized to not really let people know about it."
01:23:07;01:23:10;"I just want to say one thing about these emails before we get into it."
01:23:10;01:23:18;"What I found interesting was how emphatic 50% of the people that sent in emails were saying, ""I know someone."""
01:23:18;01:23:21;"100% this is not true."
01:23:21;01:23:25;"And the other 50% were 100% ""I know someone. This is true."""
01:23:25;01:23:30;"Right. There's truly no consensus reality anymore."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"To some people it's a fact and some people don't believe it."
01:23:32;01:23:36;"And then you can't convince anybody and then I don't even know what to believe."
01:23:36;01:23:38;"It's very political."
01:23:38;01:23:42;"And the Biden vs. Trump debates might come up."
01:23:42;01:23:46;"So, this is an idea. This is experimental, Jake."
01:23:46;01:23:54;"But our producer suggested that rather than do a whole top five, we could focus on one song that's in the top five."
01:23:54;01:23:58;"Which is from the new Taylor Swift album, The Last Great American Dynasty."
01:23:58;01:24:01;"And you know what? I say, ""Why not?"""
01:24:01;01:24:05;"Well, yeah. I listened to the first half of her album today, Driving Around."
01:24:05;01:24:09;"And that was the song that really stuck out, kind of lyrically."
01:24:09;01:24:13;"Well, that's perfect. All right. So, this song would have been number six."
01:24:13;01:24:20;"But because Taylor Swift is probably ruling the Apple Music charts because she put out this new album, why not?"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"Let's focus on one song."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"And it's The Last Great American Dynasty."
01:24:24;01:24:30;"So, probably it'll give us an opportunity to talk about America, Taylor Swift, all those things."
01:24:30;01:24:32;"Well, so first of all, Jake, I'm curious."
01:24:32;01:24:36;"Did you just throw on the Taylor album just because you heard she had a new one out?"
01:24:36;01:24:39;"Or were you prepping for T-Six?"
01:24:39;01:24:41;"A little of both."
01:24:41;01:24:48;"I mean, the other night I was having a very mellow, nice quarantine night at home playing Scrabble,"
01:24:48;01:24:51;"which I know a friend of the show, Winter, would approve of."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"Jake, you on Words With Friends?"
01:24:53;01:24:58;"I'm not, but I could be if you want to play."
01:24:58;01:25:00;"You were playing physical Scrabble?"
01:25:00;01:25:02;"I was playing physical Scrabble with my wife."
01:25:02;01:25:04;"It was after dinner. It was a very nice..."
01:25:04;01:25:06;"Wait, sorry. I'm just going to..."
01:25:06;01:25:08;"I'm sorry. Just real quick."
01:25:08;01:25:12;"I was playing physical Scrabble with my wife."
01:25:12;01:25:14;"No, I mean literally the board game."
01:25:14;01:25:18;"It's not a metaphor for anything sexual."
01:25:18;01:25:27;"All board games probably getting totally taken over by kids who are growing up just playing stuff fully on apps."
01:25:27;01:25:34;"It would be funny if they just started labeling stuff as the box starts to say physical Scrabble."
01:25:34;01:25:39;"I always thought it was funny when bands started talking about physical releases."
01:25:39;01:25:41;"Oh, right."
01:25:41;01:25:46;"Which I always thought was a really funny potential euphemism for..."
01:25:46;01:25:50;"[Laughter]"
01:25:50;01:25:56;"That's hilarious because to me that's a phrase that I feel like I just hear so often."
01:25:56;01:25:59;"I've never thought about how funny it is."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"Oh, dude. It's so dirty. Physical release."
01:26:01;01:26:03;"Physical release."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"It's so dirty."
01:26:05;01:26:07;"Physical release."
01:26:07;01:26:11;"All right. So anyway, it's a beautiful night playing physical Scrabble with your wife."
01:26:11;01:26:15;"Yeah. And then I guess she threw on the new T-Swift record."
01:26:15;01:26:17;"What did you know about it?"
01:26:17;01:26:23;"Not much. I mean, I think she informed me of the basics that it was produced by the brothers from the National."
01:26:23;01:26:28;"And this was like maybe... It's called Folklore and it's a little more stripped down."
01:26:28;01:26:33;"And that was it. And then the album was just thrown on the Sonos system."
01:26:33;01:26:37;"It didn't really catch me one way or the other. I was so focused on the game."
01:26:37;01:26:40;"Right. Yeah, it's background music if you're playing Scrabble."
01:26:40;01:26:45;"I was hoping it'd be a little more organic and crusty."
01:26:45;01:26:52;"Because you know me. I thought... It sounded stripped down, but it didn't sound rootsy or actually acoustic."
01:26:52;01:26:58;"It sounded... It's still very produced and kind of innocuous, middle of the ground kind of production choices."
01:26:58;01:27:02;"But then today I was like, ""Well, we're doing TC today."""
01:27:02;01:27:08;"It wouldn't surprise me if the gravity of her releasing a record somehow struck our show."
01:27:08;01:27:11;"We were pulled into the tractor beam to talk about it."
01:27:11;01:27:12;"Right."
01:27:12;01:27:15;"So I threw it on. I was driving from the dog park back to the studio."
01:27:15;01:27:19;"I threw it on and ""Last Great American Dynasty"" is the third song."
01:27:19;01:27:22;"And I was like, ""That's a good title."""
01:27:22;01:27:23;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:27:23;01:27:28;"I like her trying out a story song. That's kind of cool. I like that as an idea."
01:27:28;01:27:30;"What's your backstory with the record?"
01:27:30;01:27:35;"I've just got a bad habit. It's like when there's a new record that comes out that everybody's listening to,"
01:27:35;01:27:44;"I just click around on it. I listen to 30 seconds of a bunch of songs just to quickly see what I hear compared to the discourse."
01:27:44;01:27:50;"And I always walk away like, ""You know what it is? It's almost because I know I'm going to have a lot of people in my life."""
01:27:50;01:27:54;"Because I'm friends with so many music heads being like, ""Do you listen to the record?"""
01:27:54;01:27:58;"I always do this thing where it's so pointless. I barely listen to it."
01:27:58;01:28:01;"And then people are like, ""Did you listen to it?"" I'm like, ""Yeah, a little bit."""
01:28:01;01:28:04;"[Laughter]"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"I've kind of like nothing interesting to say."
01:28:06;01:28:10;"Or I could probably say something really basic about the production or something"
01:28:10;01:28:14;"because you maybe could actually glean things from 30 seconds here or there."
01:28:14;01:28:17;"But I didn't really give it the chance that it deserves."
01:28:17;01:28:23;"Just like at the end of the day, I'm still digging into a lot of 20th century music,"
01:28:23;01:28:31;"trying to find new versions of things. But I still am very interested in what's happening."
01:28:31;01:28:36;"I care about modern culture. I'm not just like a living in the past kind of dude."
01:28:36;01:28:40;"So I'm always interested when people are talking about a new record or something."
01:28:40;01:28:46;"Sometimes all I really want to do is see the name, see the cover, read a little bit"
01:28:46;01:28:49;"what people are saying about it, and then sample it a tiny bit."
01:28:49;01:28:54;"And then sometimes, maybe six months later, I go give it the respect it really deserves as a listener."
01:28:54;01:28:58;"But yeah, I was struck by it just as somebody who likes to follow pop culture."
01:28:58;01:29:04;"I was like, ""Okay, Taylor Swift."" Working with the dudes from The National,"
01:29:04;01:29:09;"following the album folklore, everything's lowercase. I find all that stuff interesting."
01:29:09;01:29:13;"And then I'm thinking like, ""Oh, I wonder what set her on this path,"
01:29:13;01:29:16;"what kind of story it tells compared to the previous records."""
01:29:16;01:29:18;"I find all that stuff very interesting."
01:29:18;01:29:22;"- Did she put out a record last year? - Yeah. This is real back to back."
01:29:22;01:29:26;"I like that. I like her being prolific. I think that's cool."
01:29:26;01:29:29;"- Yeah, full 60s vibe. - Yeah."
01:29:29;01:29:35;"Also, just in terms of Taylor Swift is one of the most beloved artists of our time,"
01:29:35;01:29:40;"but she's also controversial. I mean, obviously, the bigger you are, the more controversial you are."
01:29:40;01:29:45;"And there's all her supposed feud with Kanye. People tend to have strong feelings."
01:29:45;01:29:50;"But I'll say to some extent, I made up my mind about her a long time ago."
01:29:50;01:29:53;"She's an incredibly talented songwriter."
01:29:53;01:29:57;"And I guess all I'm saying is that makes me not..."
01:29:57;01:30:00;"I don't want to have this thing like, ""Let me hear if the new record is good or not."""
01:30:00;01:30:03;"I'm kind of like, ""Listen, she's such a consistent artist."""
01:30:03;01:30:08;"I have no doubt that it's like her operating at the same level she always operates at."
01:30:08;01:30:12;"And probably some people will love the aesthetic of this."
01:30:12;01:30:16;"Some people will be like, ""I like it, but I prefer the 1989 aesthetic."""
01:30:16;01:30:19;"It's like when somebody's craft is at a certain level,"
01:30:19;01:30:23;"you can debate which records you prefer till the cows come home."
01:30:23;01:30:27;"But really, it has more to do with which aesthetic you prefer."
01:30:27;01:30:32;"That's something I've noticed about her. Her songwriting chops are very consistent."
01:30:32;01:30:37;"Yeah. I was just thinking, because we were talking about The Eagles with Danielle,"
01:30:37;01:30:42;"maybe Taylor shares some qualities with The Eagles in the sense that"
01:30:42;01:30:48;"she's incredibly popular, but also is controversial."
01:30:48;01:30:53;"Is she controversial because she's so middle of the road in a way?"
01:30:53;01:30:58;"In the way that The Eagles were so popular, but also so despised,"
01:30:58;01:31:04;"but also so straightforward and down the middle with their aesthetic,"
01:31:04;01:31:08;"that always struck me as interesting. And I think there's something similar with her."
01:31:08;01:31:13;"It's almost like when you talk about Kanye being controversial,"
01:31:13;01:31:16;"he's a very classic, chaotic artist."
01:31:16;01:31:18;"Aesthetically transgressive."
01:31:18;01:31:22;"If somebody got on the Kanye train in 2004,"
01:31:22;01:31:26;"and then they don't know what to make of his current political statements,"
01:31:26;01:31:30;"they might literally feel like they got whiplash being a fan of him."
01:31:30;01:31:33;"Because they're like, ""Whoa, hold on. I knew you were kind of transgressive and provocative,"
01:31:33;01:31:37;"but you did a full 180 from the things I liked about you,"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"at least in terms of what you're saying politically."""
01:31:39;01:31:42;"That's a very particular kind of artistic path."
01:31:42;01:31:46;"It's like just careening from here to there."
01:31:46;01:31:49;"People falling off the train, people jumping off the train."
01:31:49;01:31:52;"It's wild. But then you talk about Taylor Swift,"
01:31:52;01:31:55;"who's like, you can understand why her music might not be for everybody,"
01:31:55;01:32:00;"but the idea of her being controversial, yeah, there is something Eagles-esque about that."
01:32:00;01:32:02;"It's just like, why?"
01:32:02;01:32:05;"How controversial can somebody be when they're like..."
01:32:05;01:32:08;"I think the way that people hate The Eagles and the way people hate Taylor Swift"
01:32:08;01:32:10;"is similar in the sense that they're like,"
01:32:10;01:32:14;"""This is one of the biggest artists of their era, and they're not cutting the mustard for me."""
01:32:14;01:32:16;"Here's my theory."
01:32:16;01:32:18;"It's interesting what you're saying about Kanye,"
01:32:18;01:32:20;"because it's not even just aesthetics."
01:32:20;01:32:25;"I think totally by design, he is divisive."
01:32:25;01:32:30;"It's interesting with her, because she actually wants to be globally liked."
01:32:30;01:32:34;"It's so pop that it's almost, I think,"
01:32:34;01:32:39;"someone who wants to be liked so much and be so four-quadrant"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"that they're liked by everybody."
01:32:41;01:32:44;"That makes them divisive."
01:32:44;01:32:47;"It's such a populist idea of a person."
01:32:47;01:32:53;"You're right, operating at very high levels of songwriting and musicianship and everything,"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"but in wanting to be liked so much,"
01:32:55;01:32:58;"like someone who goes into a party and just wants to be liked,"
01:32:58;01:33:01;"everyone says, ""Oh, they're the most likable person I know,"""
01:33:01;01:33:05;"as a reaction, is then immediately divisive."
01:33:05;01:33:06;"Does that make sense?"
01:33:06;01:33:09;"It's the exact opposite of a Kanye,"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"but they both end up in the same place."
01:33:11;01:33:12;"Yeah."
01:33:12;01:33:15;"Yeah, I've had thoughts like that when thinking about music"
01:33:15;01:33:18;"and what an album is supposed to accomplish,"
01:33:18;01:33:23;"because the more that an album or even broadly a music career"
01:33:23;01:33:29;"has a point of view and successfully communicates that point of view,"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"whether the point of view is trying to be provocative"
01:33:31;01:33:33;"or even the point of view is trying to be liked,"
01:33:33;01:33:36;"whatever it is, the more you can see the shape of it,"
01:33:36;01:33:40;"the more it's going to have equal and opposite reactions."
01:33:40;01:33:43;"I guess what I'm saying is there's a slight paradox."
01:33:43;01:33:46;"Is the person who wants to be provocative, the Kanye,"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"""Make them like you, make them unlike you,"""
01:33:48;01:33:50;"is one of his famous lines,"
01:33:50;01:33:53;"the guy who will straight up alienate people"
01:33:53;01:33:56;"but then also make transcended art that people love."
01:33:56;01:34:01;"The person who does that and the person who actively is concerned with people liking them"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"and feels wounded when they don't like them,"
01:34:03;01:34:06;"I'm basing that off of some of the interesting things"
01:34:06;01:34:08;"that Taylor Swift said in her documentary."
01:34:08;01:34:11;"She talks a lot about her complicated feelings about wanting to be liked"
01:34:11;01:34:16;"and how that not being liked makes her feel very basic human emotions."
01:34:16;01:34:20;"I would say there's a weird paradox where both of those forms,"
01:34:20;01:34:22;"they're almost like equally provocative."
01:34:22;01:34:23;"The person who's trying to be provocative"
01:34:23;01:34:26;"and the person who's trying just to be big but not provocative,"
01:34:26;01:34:29;"they both rock the boat in similar ways."
01:34:29;01:34:30;"And maybe that's just human nature."
01:34:30;01:34:31;"Maybe at the end of the day,"
01:34:31;01:34:36;"the reason that Taylor Swift and Kanye have been locked into this strange relationship"
01:34:36;01:34:41;"for 10 plus years is on some yin-yang shit."
01:34:41;01:34:44;"It's like they're different but they're also the same."
01:34:44;01:34:46;"You could call them opposites,"
01:34:46;01:34:49;"but they probably have more in common than they're different"
01:34:49;01:34:53;"or their difference is what makes them part of one big unit"
01:34:53;01:34:56;"that people clearly enjoy watching, the ups and downs."
01:34:56;01:34:58;"It's interesting, Kanye was going to put out an album the same week."
01:34:58;01:35:01;"Wow, that would have been a trip."
01:35:01;01:35:05;"But anyway, as I said, Taylor Swift's pretty unimpeachable as a songwriter."
01:35:05;01:35:07;"So let's check out this song."
01:35:07;01:35:08;"Yeah."
01:35:08;01:35:11;"This track, ""The Last Great American Dynasty"""
01:35:11;01:35:14;"is the story of one of the wealthiest women in America,"
01:35:14;01:35:16;"Rebecca West Harkness."
01:35:20;01:35:23;"Rebecca rode up on the afternoon train"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"It was sunny"
01:35:25;01:35:27;"Her saltbox house on the coast"
01:35:27;01:35:30;"Took her mind off St. Louis"
01:35:30;01:35:36;"Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name"
01:35:36;01:35:38;"And money"
01:35:38;01:35:43;"And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcee do it?"""
01:35:46;01:35:49;"The wedding was charming, if a little ghost"
01:35:49;01:35:52;"It was only so far, new money goes"
01:35:52;01:35:56;"They picked out a home and called it Holiday House"
01:35:56;01:36:02;"Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud"
01:36:02;01:36:05;"The doctor had told them to settle down"
01:36:05;01:36:09;"It must have been her fault, his heart gave out"
01:36:09;01:36:15;"And they said, ""There goes the last great American dynasty"""
01:36:16;01:36:21;"Who knows if she never showed up, what could have been"
01:36:21;01:36:28;"There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen"
01:36:28;01:36:33;"She had a marvelous time ruining everything"
01:36:33;01:36:36;"Okay. So, let's unpack there."
01:36:36;01:36:40;"Yeah. I mean, if you didn't do any sort of research,"
01:36:40;01:36:43;"it'd be hard to parse this out."
01:36:43;01:36:47;"I ended up hitting the Rebecca Harkness Wikipedia page"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"after listening to this."
01:36:49;01:36:52;"So, she married this dude Bill Harkness,"
01:36:52;01:36:56;"who was the heir to the Standard Oil name, or money."
01:36:56;01:36:58;"They bought this house in Rhode Island,"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"and then he died a few years later."
01:37:00;01:37:03;"Was there intrigue? People wondering, ""Did she murder him?"""
01:37:03;01:37:07;"I didn't see anything like that, but the last line of the verse,"
01:37:07;01:37:10;"they were partying, basically."
01:37:10;01:37:13;"The doctor told him to settle down,"
01:37:13;01:37:16;"it must have been her fault, his heart gave out."
01:37:16;01:37:19;"So, it sounded like she was a wild child,"
01:37:19;01:37:23;"in the 20s, like a flapper style."
01:37:23;01:37:27;"Like a ""it"" girl around St. Louis, and then met this guy."
01:37:27;01:37:31;"And the song's saying that she's then vilified"
01:37:31;01:37:34;"post his death."
01:37:34;01:37:38;"Yeah. I don't know who was vilifying her,"
01:37:38;01:37:41;"if it was his family, or..."
01:37:41;01:37:44;"It's interesting, in the song, she says"
01:37:44;01:37:47;"that the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcee do it?"""
01:37:47;01:37:50;"Because Rebecca Harkness was a divorcee,"
01:37:50;01:37:55;"which, back then, people might think was somewhat scandalous."
01:37:55;01:37:57;"Was she truly middle-class, though?"
01:37:57;01:38:00;"It says on Wikipedia that she was the second daughter"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"of a socially prominent stockbroker,"
01:38:02;01:38:05;"and the founder of a company in St. Louis,"
01:38:05;01:38:08;"and her grandfather founded the St. Louis Union Trust Company."
01:38:08;01:38:11;"So, it sounds like she was kind of from money, too."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"Totally."
01:38:12;01:38:14;"You know what that makes me think of?"
01:38:14;01:38:18;"Whenever you would see stuff about the royal family in the UK,"
01:38:18;01:38:21;"especially as a kid growing up,"
01:38:21;01:38:25;"you'd kind of be aware that there was this weird tension"
01:38:25;01:38:28;"between Princess Diana and the rest of the family,"
01:38:28;01:38:31;"which, of course, people talked about again,"
01:38:31;01:38:34;"because there seems to have been tension with Meghan Markle,"
01:38:34;01:38:37;"the wife of Prince Harry, all this stuff."
01:38:37;01:38:40;"But when people would talk about Diana being like--"
01:38:40;01:38:43;"and I've seen these interviews where people are like--"
01:38:43;01:38:45;"she basically says, ""You know what?"
01:38:45;01:38:48;"I was a non-starter for that family."
01:38:48;01:38:50;"They kind of looked down on me. They didn't like my vibe."""
01:38:50;01:38:52;"Almost like a Rebecca Harkness thing."
01:38:52;01:38:55;"And so, there was a part of me that always wondered,"
01:38:55;01:38:59;"""Was Princess Diana from the streets?"""
01:38:59;01:39:01;"And then you kind of realize, ""No, Princess Diana,"
01:39:01;01:39:04;"she's super old money royalty herself."""
01:39:04;01:39:07;"So, there are these-- I guess maybe it is a classic TC thing,"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"the narcissism of small difference."
01:39:09;01:39:11;"I do feel like these stories come up a lot"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"where you hear about this-- old stories about"
01:39:13;01:39:16;"this real mismatched couple, it was real tension,"
01:39:16;01:39:19;"and you're kind of like, ""It sounds like they're all just rich people."""
01:39:19;01:39:21;"Maybe there were some really slight differences."
01:39:21;01:39:25;"They basically sound like from the same kind of stock."
01:39:25;01:39:28;"Right. His grandfather didn't get into Harvard,"
01:39:28;01:39:30;"so he went to Yale, okay?"
01:39:30;01:39:32;"Right, yeah. That kind of vibe."
01:39:32;01:39:35;"The narcissism of small differences."
01:39:35;01:39:38;"And then, so when they say, ""There goes the last great American dynasty,"""
01:39:38;01:39:40;"they're basically saying this Harkness woman"
01:39:40;01:39:43;"showed up and ruined the dynasty?"
01:39:43;01:39:47;"Yes. And it's the people in that time,"
01:39:47;01:39:50;"in 19-whatever."
01:39:50;01:39:52;"I don't know when he died. I forget."
01:39:52;01:39:54;"Early 50s."
01:39:54;01:39:57;"The local Rhode Island elite."
01:39:57;01:40:00;"They were oblivious to the dynasty in the neighboring state"
01:40:00;01:40:02;"called the Kennedys."
01:40:02;01:40:04;"I guess they were just getting started then."
01:40:04;01:40:07;"I feel like in the early 50s the Kennedys were up and running, but yeah."
01:40:07;01:40:11;"Right. Well, once they got one of his boys in the White House,"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"that probably took it to another level."
01:40:13;01:40:15;"But yeah, sure."
01:40:15;01:40:17;"So, you know, whatever. Being a little bit dramatic,"
01:40:17;01:40:19;"""There goes the last great American dynasty,"""
01:40:19;01:40:21;"but clearly this woman's vilified. She's being blamed."
01:40:21;01:40:23;"Let's get into verse 2."
01:40:45;01:40:48;"Okay, pause it for a second."
01:40:48;01:40:52;"This is the coolest description of decadent rich people."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"""Blew the money on..."""
01:40:54;01:40:59;"Well, okay, filling the pool of champagne is just completely insane and unbelievable,"
01:40:59;01:41:02;"but straight out of some hilarious rap video."
01:41:02;01:41:04;"But then, ""Blew the money on ballet."""
01:41:04;01:41:06;"This is awesome."
01:41:06;01:41:11;"I mean, Rebecca Harkness did start a big ballet conservatory."
01:41:11;01:41:14;"Or she was willing to fund one,"
01:41:14;01:41:19;"and then when they didn't take her name on as the new name of the conservatory,"
01:41:19;01:41:20;"she started her own."
01:41:20;01:41:22;"That's where she was at with it."
01:41:22;01:41:26;"And then, I guess he's playing cards with Salvador Dali?"
01:41:26;01:41:29;"I didn't see that in the Wikipedia page, but..."
01:41:29;01:41:32;"She was buried in the urn that was designed by Dali as well,"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"when she passed away."
01:41:34;01:41:35;"So she was a real Dali head."
01:41:35;01:41:37;"I mean, it tells all this time."
01:41:37;01:41:39;"Like, the really successful artists,"
01:41:39;01:41:42;"they need rich people to make them rich."
01:41:42;01:41:46;"Because obviously, you can only sell so many pieces of art."
01:41:46;01:41:50;"And then, the rich people want the fascinating surrealists"
01:41:50;01:41:52;"to make their life more colorful."
01:41:52;01:41:54;"It's a perfect pair."
01:41:54;01:41:57;"Because those other two things, like fact check,"
01:41:57;01:41:59;"with the ballet and the Dali,"
01:41:59;01:42:01;"do you think that there's some moment"
01:42:01;01:42:04;"where she really did fill a pool with champagne?"
01:42:04;01:42:05;"No, I mean, you would need--"
01:42:05;01:42:06;"How big is a pool?"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"Like, at least 10,000 gallons?"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:42:10;01:42:11;"There's no way."
01:42:11;01:42:14;"I guess there's a book about her life"
01:42:14;01:42:18;"where the writer claims that she cleaned her pool"
01:42:18;01:42:20;"with Dom Perignon."
01:42:20;01:42:21;"Cleaned it?"
01:42:21;01:42:22;"What?"
01:42:22;01:42:23;"What does that even mean?"
01:42:23;01:42:25;"I don't know what it means."
01:42:25;01:42:28;"One interesting thing about this is,"
01:42:28;01:42:32;"so far in the song, I don't know--"
01:42:32;01:42:35;"I imagine we got a classic Taylor twist coming,"
01:42:35;01:42:38;"because, of course, you can see it's being set up"
01:42:38;01:42:39;"a little bit to being like,"
01:42:39;01:42:42;"""Oh, like the kind of conservative losers were unfair"
01:42:42;01:42:44;"to this free-spirited woman."""
01:42:44;01:42:45;"Sure."
01:42:45;01:42:46;"Yeah."
01:42:46;01:42:49;"But also, it's not exactly a heroic story either."
01:42:49;01:42:51;"It's like, ""All right, your rich husband dies,"
01:42:51;01:42:54;"you inherit all this money from Standard Oil,"
01:42:54;01:42:55;"and then--"""
01:42:55;01:42:57;"You're blowing it on boys and the ballet."
01:42:57;01:43:01;"Yeah, then you have a lot of fun, respect,"
01:43:01;01:43:03;"but also, I mean, I'm curious."
01:43:03;01:43:05;"I'm like, ""All right, where's this going?"""
01:43:05;01:43:08;"Yeah, like, where's the idealism?"

01:44:08;01:44:12;"partied there a bunch, it sounds like she bailed on that Rhode Island,"
01:44:12;01:44:14;"that southern Rhode Island scene."
01:44:14;01:44:15;"Yeah."
01:44:15;01:44:17;"Is this Taylor Swift's Hamilton?"
01:44:17;01:44:20;"Oh, kind of. Getting into a little bit of American history."
01:44:20;01:44:25;"But what's the moral or sort of philosophical vision here?"
01:44:25;01:44:27;"We're not at the end of the song."
01:44:27;01:44:29;"We're not at the end yet."
01:44:29;01:44:32;"But I will say, I always like little twists in songs,"
01:44:32;01:44:34;"and Taylor Swift, she always does it."
01:44:34;01:44:37;"She's very talented with like the architecture of songwriting."
01:44:37;01:44:39;"You know, whether or not it's for you, you can't deny that"
01:44:39;01:44:41;"she knows that stuff inside and out."
01:44:41;01:44:44;"I will say that I like songs where"
01:44:44;01:44:47;"it kind of seems like it's just a story song."
01:44:47;01:44:50;"Like you're never gonna hear the first person."
01:44:50;01:44:54;"And then suddenly there's a twist where suddenly the I jumps out."
01:44:54;01:44:58;"I just think it's like an interesting way of doing things."
01:44:58;01:45:00;"I mean, I guess that could happen in a novel too,"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"where it's like telling the story and then suddenly"
01:45:02;01:45:05;"somehow it swings back to the narrator in a more personal way."
01:45:05;01:45:07;"You know, it's about perspective."
01:45:07;01:45:11;"That's the first song of Hamilton, I think."
01:45:11;01:45:13;"And I'm the man that's for you."
01:45:13;01:45:15;"Oh, because he kind of goes, ""That's me!"""
01:45:15;01:45:17;"[laughter]"
01:45:17;01:45:19;"Exactly."
01:45:19;01:45:23;"But I like in her version, when she announces herself,"
01:45:23;01:45:25;"is that she's buying something."
01:45:25;01:45:27;"And then it was bought by me."
01:45:27;01:45:30;"I mean, you gotta respect the architecture."
01:45:30;01:45:32;"No pun intended."
01:45:32;01:45:34;"But you know what song it makes me think of?"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"What's kind of like a famous song that"
01:45:36;01:45:38;"somebody's gonna be mad that I'm comparing these songs,"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"but I don't care."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"A song that does a similar thing is"
01:45:42;01:45:45;"Neil Young's ""Cortez the Killer."""
01:45:45;01:45:47;"Interesting. I'm trying to remember."
01:45:47;01:45:49;"I think of that song as being about"
01:45:49;01:45:52;"""What they build up with their bare hands,"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"what we still can't build today."""
01:45:54;01:45:57;"Well, it's not quite the same, but ""Cortez the Killer,"""
01:45:57;01:45:59;"like classic Neil song."
01:45:59;01:46:01;"Dave Matthews covers it a lot."
01:46:01;01:46:03;"But so that's a story, you know,"
01:46:03;01:46:05;"Neil Young's always been interested in the"
01:46:05;01:46:08;"indigenous cultures of the Americas."
01:46:08;01:46:10;"And even the song title's so provocative,"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"""Cortez the Killer,"" you know,"
01:46:12;01:46:15;"it's like about Cortez the Spanish explorer/villain."
01:46:15;01:46:17;"His opening verse is,"
01:46:17;01:46:20;"""He came dancing across the water with his galleons and guns,"
01:46:20;01:46:23;"looking for the new world in that palace in the sun,"
01:46:23;01:46:26;"on the shore of Le Montezuma, with his coca leaves and pearls."
01:46:26;01:46:29;"In his halls, he often wandered with the secrets of the world."""
01:46:29;01:46:30;"Wow."
01:46:30;01:46:32;"So basically he's talking about this like,"
01:46:32;01:46:37;"crazy, world-shifting, tragic moment in history,"
01:46:37;01:46:41;"which is the Europeans first making contact"
01:46:41;01:46:44;"and ultimately destroying and murdering,"
01:46:44;01:46:48;"but first making contact with the civilization of,"
01:46:48;01:46:51;"you know, what today would be Latin America or Mexico."
01:46:51;01:46:53;"Obviously, Neil is,"
01:46:53;01:46:56;"his heart lies with the indigenous people."
01:46:56;01:46:58;"He has a lot of songs that express that,"
01:46:58;01:47:00;"and he's describing their civilization,"
01:47:00;01:47:03;"and he clearly idealizes it"
01:47:03;01:47:06;"the same way that Taylor Swift idealizes Rebecca Harkness."
01:47:06;01:47:08;"The whole song, he's just painting this picture."
01:47:08;01:47:10;"He never uses ""I,"""
01:47:10;01:47:13;"he's just talking about the moment just before"
01:47:13;01:47:17;"Cortez the Killer showed up and destroyed it."
01:47:17;01:47:19;"And yeah, there's a part that's so memorable to me is,"
01:47:19;01:47:22;"the people worked together and they lifted many stones,"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"and they carried them to the flatlands,"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"but they died along the way,"
01:47:26;01:47:28;"and they built up with their bare hands,"
01:47:28;01:47:29;"what we still can't do today."
01:47:29;01:47:30;"That's the one that you were talking about."
01:47:30;01:47:31;"Yeah."
01:47:31;01:47:33;"Because he's so impressed by the civilization"
01:47:33;01:47:36;"that those people built before the Europeans came."
01:47:36;01:47:38;"So, you know, that's most of the song."
01:47:38;01:47:39;"That's 90% of the song."
01:47:39;01:47:42;"And then, out of nowhere, there's this verse."
01:47:42;01:47:45;"And I feel like a lot of people have talked about this."
01:47:45;01:47:47;"It's like such a classic songwriting shift."
01:47:47;01:47:48;"So he's painting this picture,"
01:47:48;01:47:49;"and then just out of nowhere, he goes,"
01:47:49;01:47:52;"""And I know she's living there,"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"and she loves me to this day."
01:47:54;01:47:58;"I still can't remember when or how I lost my way."""
01:47:58;01:47:59;"And then it goes back to,"
01:47:59;01:48:01;"""He came dancing across the water."
01:48:01;01:48:03;"Cortez, Cortez, what a killer."""
01:48:03;01:48:04;"So there's like this one twist at the end,"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"where suddenly it goes into the first person."
01:48:06;01:48:07;"Yeah."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"I still can't really make heads or tails of it,"
01:48:09;01:48:12;"but I will say that just as a perspective shift,"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"it's like very affecting."
01:48:14;01:48:15;"Who is he talking about?"
01:48:15;01:48:17;"Is she literally just a woman?"
01:48:17;01:48:19;"It almost gives you this weird feeling that"
01:48:19;01:48:23;"Neil Young is so deep studying the history"
01:48:23;01:48:26;"of the colonization of the Americas."
01:48:26;01:48:28;"And it's like he's so moved by it."
01:48:28;01:48:30;"You almost picture he literally puts down a book,"
01:48:30;01:48:33;"and then he looks up, and he's so f***ed up."
01:48:33;01:48:37;"And then he just thinks about some personal life s***."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"He's so moved by it,"
01:48:39;01:48:40;"and then he just thinks about"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"somehow the depth of the emotion"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"makes him think about something"
01:48:44;01:48:46;"that he f***ed up in his own life."
01:48:46;01:48:48;"On a subconscious level."
01:48:48;01:48:51;"I bet the sense I get with him writing songs"
01:48:51;01:48:55;"is it's very trying to channel the subconscious"
01:48:55;01:48:57;"and not overthinking it."
01:48:57;01:48:58;"But I can see what you're saying"
01:48:58;01:49:02;"working on an intuitive and not analytical level."
01:49:02;01:49:05;"Imagine if the last verse of ""Hurricane"" by Bob Dylan,"
01:49:05;01:49:07;"when he's telling the whole story,"
01:49:07;01:49:08;"the imprisonment of Ruma Carter,"
01:49:08;01:49:10;"and then Bob Dylan's like,"
01:49:10;01:49:13;"""And my heart is still broken for my ex-wife."""
01:49:13;01:49:15;"You'd be like, ""Yo, what happened?"""
01:49:15;01:49:17;"If I did have to make heads or tails of it,"
01:49:17;01:49:19;"I would say that it's almost like"
01:49:19;01:49:24;"he's juxtaposing the insane violence and destruction"
01:49:24;01:49:27;"that Western civilization,"
01:49:27;01:49:29;"specifically North American civilization,"
01:49:29;01:49:32;"including his home country of Canada, is built on,"
01:49:32;01:49:35;"and that he's juxtaposing the blood-soaked history"
01:49:35;01:49:37;"of this continent"
01:49:37;01:49:43;"with the weird, sad, painful aimlessness of modern life."
01:49:43;01:49:46;"I still can't remember when or how I lost my way."
01:49:46;01:49:48;"Which I can, you know,"
01:49:48;01:49:50;"it's like if you're sitting in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven"
01:49:50;01:49:53;"feeling depressed, and then suddenly it dawned on you"
01:49:53;01:49:55;"what was happening 400 years ago"
01:49:55;01:49:58;"in the spot that you're on now today,"
01:49:58;01:50:01;"just thinking about how you don't want to go to work or some sh*t."
01:50:01;01:50:03;"It's heavy and weird."
01:50:03;01:50:05;"I'm worried that in the next verse"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"we're going to learn that it's not that deep."
01:50:07;01:50:10;"Matt sent me an article"
01:50:10;01:50:14;"that said that the locals were really mad"
01:50:14;01:50:17;"at Taylor Swift's beach patrol"
01:50:17;01:50:20;"and her security"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"when she moved into the house."
01:50:22;01:50:25;"She was sort of alienated from the community"
01:50:25;01:50:27;"like Harkness"
01:50:27;01:50:30;"because she sort of rolled in too deep."
01:50:30;01:50:33;"So, we'll find out."
01:50:33;01:50:36;"I think we're about to find out if that's how deep this goes."
01:50:36;01:50:38;"It's not that metaphorical."
01:50:38;01:50:40;"It's literally just being like,"
01:50:40;01:50:41;"I'll tell you what, man."
01:50:41;01:50:44;"Rhode Islanders, they've always been a*****."
01:50:44;01:50:46;"Super uptight people."
01:50:46;01:50:48;"It's like a f*** Rhode Island."
01:51:16;01:51:18;"Did you?"
01:51:24;01:51:26;"This is why I'm not a Taylor fan, really."
01:51:26;01:51:28;"Because like,"
01:51:28;01:51:30;"first of all,"
01:51:30;01:51:32;"she doesn't seem like she has any fun."
01:51:32;01:51:35;"So, it's like, did she have a marvelous time?"
01:51:35;01:51:37;"Wait, wait, hold on. That's harsh."
01:51:37;01:51:38;"Why do you think she doesn't have fun?"
01:51:38;01:51:40;"I just get that sense."
01:51:40;01:51:42;"And then like,"
01:51:42;01:51:45;"that's based on nothing."
01:51:45;01:51:47;"Alright, fair."
01:51:47;01:51:49;"You know what this song is a little bit like?"
01:51:49;01:51:51;"It's like when you find out at the end of Fight Club"
01:51:51;01:51:54;"that Ed Norton is Tyler Durden."
01:51:54;01:51:58;"The two characters sort of coalesce into one character."
01:51:58;01:52:00;"Again, no pun intended, but like,"
01:52:00;01:52:03;"she's somebody who, especially she made this album quick."
01:52:03;01:52:06;"That's some s*** I cannot relate to."
01:52:06;01:52:08;"I love that. That's great."
01:52:08;01:52:11;"And also, I'm not going to judge this song too harshly on my first listen."
01:52:11;01:52:14;"She's written many songs that I do think are moving,"
01:52:14;01:52:17;"but this song, again,"
01:52:17;01:52:18;"yeah, that's a good point Seinfeld."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"It's on that Fight Club s***."
01:52:20;01:52:23;"Whether this song is for you, or your favorite,"
01:52:23;01:52:25;"or your least favorite on the album,"
01:52:25;01:52:29;"she is just somebody who has a knack for the architecture of songwriting."
01:52:29;01:52:31;"She probably sat down with this,"
01:52:31;01:52:34;"I don't know if she started it, or the Nationals started it, or whatever,"
01:52:34;01:52:37;"but she probably started coming up with lyrics,"
01:52:37;01:52:38;"and she had this idea, like,"
01:52:38;01:52:40;"I'm going to make it about her,"
01:52:40;01:52:42;"and then I'm going to shift to saying how it's my house,"
01:52:42;01:52:44;"and then I'm going to say they say the same thing about me,"
01:52:44;01:52:46;"we kind of coalesce into one character,"
01:52:46;01:52:49;"and we're out onto the next song."
01:52:49;01:52:52;"Again, architecture."
01:52:52;01:52:57;"She has such a cold appraisal of her process."
01:52:57;01:53:00;"No, but I'm saying, look, songwriting,"
01:53:00;01:53:04;"there is a coldness in terms of the song structure and stuff,"
01:53:04;01:53:09;"and the best songwriters understand that a good song"
01:53:09;01:53:14;"has a bridge that kind of takes your understanding of the song to another level,"
01:53:14;01:53:17;"and maybe a final verse that surprises you."
01:53:17;01:53:20;"I don't know, there are kind of very dry things you could say."
01:53:20;01:53:23;"So I'm not trying to say that she's cold or anything."
01:53:23;01:53:27;"I'm saying maybe she has a cold knack for the architecture of songwriting,"
01:53:27;01:53:30;"and then the emotion fills it in."
01:53:30;01:53:32;"She understands those tropes, and she's very precise,"
01:53:32;01:53:36;"and she's a master of how to construct those things."
01:53:36;01:53:39;"Yeah, and look, not all songs have that."
01:53:39;01:53:40;"What's a classic example?"
01:53:40;01:53:42;"Like, ""He Stopped Loving Her Today."""
01:53:42;01:53:45;"People always bring that up, because it's a classic Beautiful Country song,"
01:53:45;01:53:50;"and the whole big twist is you find out it's the day somebody's died."
01:53:50;01:53:51;"It's his funeral day."
01:53:51;01:53:53;"That's why he stopped loving her."
01:53:53;01:53:55;"Spoiler alert."
01:53:55;01:53:57;"I don't think you should have to do spoiler alerts for songs."
01:53:57;01:53:58;"[Laughter]"
01:53:58;01:54:01;"But people love the architecture of that song,"
01:54:01;01:54:03;"because you're talking to--"
01:54:03;01:54:06;"you know, it's the same reason people like Christopher Nolan movies and sh*t."
01:54:06;01:54:08;"It's the architecture."
01:54:08;01:54:10;"I need a word besides architecture."
01:54:10;01:54:11;"Structure."
01:54:11;01:54:12;"That's better."
01:54:12;01:54:14;"I've said architecture way too many times."
01:54:14;01:54:18;"But, okay, I will say I could picture a version of this song"
01:54:18;01:54:23;"that just went one step further, which she does all the time in songs,"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"so I'm really not judging her,"
01:54:25;01:54:28;"but that went one step further where it's like--"
01:54:28;01:54:29;"I don't know."
01:54:29;01:54:31;"Yeah, I guess, clearly, I was very unfair in even bringing up"
01:54:31;01:54:35;"Cortez the Killer, because that's a very deep, vibey, moving song."
01:54:35;01:54:39;"Honestly, now I'm thinking about the people who lived in Rhode Island"
01:54:39;01:54:43;"way before the Standard Oil eras and the Harknesses."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"Oh, wow."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"Imagine a--"
01:54:45;01:54:47;"Terrence Malick-style song?"
01:54:47;01:54:48;"Yeah, exactly."
01:54:48;01:54:50;"Just the full history of--"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"Dinosaurs and sh*t."
01:54:52;01:54:55;"Yeah, just Tree of Life meets New World."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"It opens with Pangaea."
01:54:57;01:54:59;"[Laughter]"
01:54:59;01:55:02;"Wait, this is a great start,"
01:55:02;01:55:06;"but I would love to see a 10-song T-Swift record."
01:55:06;01:55:10;"Track 1 is all just about the natural history."
01:55:10;01:55:15;"It opens a billion years ago, before the continents moved apart."
01:55:15;01:55:16;"Wouldn't that be crazy?"
01:55:16;01:55:20;"And then Rebecca Harkness only shows up on track 7,"
01:55:20;01:55:23;"and then track 10 is about her living in the house."
01:55:23;01:55:27;"And I will say, as far as super-rich people go--"
01:55:27;01:55:30;"I remember hearing that Taylor Swift bought a house out there."
01:55:30;01:55:32;"I wonder what the backstory of that is,"
01:55:32;01:55:34;"because I remember being interested."
01:55:34;01:55:37;"It doesn't surprise me that she was interested in the history of this house,"
01:55:37;01:55:42;"because a rich, young-ish person who buys a house in Newport, Rhode Island,"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"without having a family connection there,"
01:55:44;01:55:50;"already clearly has some type of interest in the history of American wealth or something."
01:55:50;01:55:51;"It's just like--"
01:55:51;01:55:55;"If you told me that Taylor Swift owned houses in New York City,"
01:55:55;01:55:58;"her home state, and--"
01:55:58;01:56:00;"-Montauk. -Nashville, and--"
01:56:00;01:56:03;"Hamptons, or L.A., I'd be like, ""Yeah, all right."""
01:56:03;01:56:05;"Those are classic rich people things."
01:56:05;01:56:06;"What are you going to add after that?"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"Like a house in Hawaii?"
01:56:08;01:56:11;"A house in the Caribbean, London?"
01:56:11;01:56:13;"Newport, Rhode Island. It's on some different sh*t."
01:56:13;01:56:15;"Wait, do you guys have any info?"
01:56:15;01:56:16;"She bought that house--"
01:56:16;01:56:21;"She bought it for $17.75 million in 2013."
01:56:21;01:56:22;"-Expensive. -One of her many homes."
01:56:22;01:56:24;"She's from Connecticut, correct?"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"-No. -No."
01:56:26;01:56:27;"She's from Tennessee, right?"
01:56:27;01:56:28;"No."
01:56:28;01:56:30;"No. She's from Pennsylvania."
01:56:30;01:56:32;"-My bad. -But Nick, come on."
01:56:32;01:56:34;"If Taylor Swift was from Connecticut,"
01:56:34;01:56:36;"do you really think that never would have come up?"
01:56:36;01:56:42;"I knew that, but I also knew that the major sort of misinformation"
01:56:42;01:56:45;"or misjudgment about her was that she's from Nashville, right?"
01:56:45;01:56:47;"Because she started in this country."
01:56:47;01:56:48;"I knew she was East Coast."
01:56:48;01:56:50;"You're right that she's not Southern."
01:56:50;01:56:51;"The year before she bought this house,"
01:56:51;01:56:55;"she bought a different house near the Kennedy compound"
01:56:55;01:56:57;"in Hyannisport, Massachusetts."
01:56:57;01:56:58;"Cape Cod."
01:56:58;01:57:01;"Cape Cod. Yeah, she flipped it in November."
01:57:01;01:57:06;"So, I mean, this could just be an investment process for her"
01:57:06;01:57:09;"where she buys these homes and then a couple years later"
01:57:09;01:57:14;"sells them for-- and makes, I don't know, a mil or two profit."
01:57:14;01:57:17;"And then this song is going to increase the value of the home."
01:57:17;01:57:18;"-Whoa. -I think you just nailed it."
01:57:18;01:57:20;"That's a great point, Jake."
01:57:20;01:57:21;"Very savvy."
01:57:21;01:57:23;"Well, you know, it's funny because that's the thing."
01:57:23;01:57:27;"Have you ever watched these architectural digest YouTube videos"
01:57:27;01:57:31;"where people-- it's basically a slightly more elite Cribs?"
01:57:31;01:57:33;"No, I never have."
01:57:33;01:57:35;"Some of them are funny."
01:57:35;01:57:37;"There's a good one with a friend of the show, Mark Ronson."
01:57:37;01:57:39;"He's actually really funny."
01:57:39;01:57:42;"It's his very dry, kind of self-deprecating sense of humor"
01:57:42;01:57:44;"as he shows his house."
01:57:44;01:57:46;"And then there's other ones that are just super awkward."
01:57:46;01:57:50;"But watching some of them, I've asked people, like,"
01:57:50;01:57:52;"""Why do people do these?"""
01:57:52;01:57:56;"Because obviously some people have all sorts of different feelings about privacy."
01:57:56;01:57:59;"But, you know, some of these people, I see them showing their house"
01:57:59;01:58:01;"and I'm just like, ""Why would this person want to show their house?"
01:58:01;01:58:04;"It just seems, like, kind of private."""
01:58:04;01:58:07;"And nine times out of ten, it's because they're about to sell it."
01:58:07;01:58:11;"But if she is interested in selling this house in the not-too-distant future,"
01:58:11;01:58:14;"she'd just put all that to shame because--"
01:58:14;01:58:15;"That's a great point, Jake."
01:58:15;01:58:18;"This is the next level way of kind of, like, immortalizing"
01:58:18;01:58:21;"what was already kind of a famous house."
01:58:21;01:58:23;"Well, should we chip in?"
01:58:23;01:58:25;"Should we throw it down together?"
01:58:25;01:58:26;"Make that the TC Party House?"
01:58:26;01:58:32;"Jake, you should write a song about your 1990 Dunross baseball cards."
01:58:32;01:58:33;"[laughter]"
01:58:33;01:58:36;"Make that a mountain bridge track."
01:58:36;01:58:38;"[laughter]"
01:58:38;01:58:41;"That's a pretty good title, ""90 Dunross."""
01:58:41;01:58:43;"[laughter]"
01:58:43;01:58:47;"Another thing I'll say about this song is that I am kind of interested"
01:58:47;01:58:50;"in, like, this other level where it's kind of like,"
01:58:50;01:58:53;"what does it say about this time in your life that you had"
01:58:53;01:58:55;"a marvelous time ruining everything?"
01:58:55;01:58:59;"And I have a feeling that it's totally fine that this song doesn't answer that"
01:58:59;01:59:04;"because I bet in the context of this album, you probably get some other clues"
01:59:04;01:59:08;"about, like, this time in her life, what it meant to her to, like,"
01:59:08;01:59:09;"buy this house."
01:59:09;01:59:13;"I have a feeling, like, a song like this is probably a real, like,"
01:59:13;01:59:16;"interesting piece of the puzzle of the record."
01:59:16;01:59:17;"You know what I mean?"
01:59:17;01:59:18;"Yeah."
01:59:18;01:59:22;"Where it's like, this one song doesn't have to take you deep into her head."
01:59:22;01:59:23;"I bet other songs do."
01:59:23;01:59:29;"From this song, I can sympathize why she relates to Rebecca Harkness."
01:59:29;01:59:35;"She feels like she's, like, the wealthy, high-profile woman who comes in"
01:59:35;01:59:38;"and, like, stirs stuff up in this quiet community."
01:59:38;01:59:39;"I get that."
01:59:39;01:59:43;"It is a little banal still, where it's just sort of like,"
01:59:43;01:59:45;"well, I just bought this house."
01:59:45;01:59:48;"I still don't have a sense of, like, what she thinks."
01:59:48;01:59:50;"You know what's weird, though?"
01:59:50;01:59:54;"In classic Less Is More, just because I got the lyrics open as we talked,"
01:59:54;01:59:59;"and I'm just thinking about how, again, she very interestingly changes"
01:59:59;02:00:03;"the chorus to ""I,"" the final chorus, ""Who knows if I never showed up"
02:00:03;02:00:04;"what could have been."""
02:00:04;02:00:07;"Now I'm just picturing if she just cut that and it ended with a bridge,"
02:00:07;02:00:10;"where the whole thing has been about Rebecca Harkness,"
02:00:10;02:00:12;"and then it was bought by me."
02:00:12;02:00:13;"The end."
02:00:13;02:00:17;"Just, like, this eeriness of, like, what the f--- happened."
02:00:17;02:00:20;"It also makes me think a little bit of, like, you know,"
02:00:20;02:00:23;"real classic, great lyricist."
02:00:23;02:00:26;"Love him or hate him, you can't deny that Morrissey is--"
02:00:26;02:00:27;"Oh, yeah."
02:00:27;02:00:29;"--truly on another level in his prime."
02:00:29;02:00:33;"But just, like, the song Cemetery Gates, it's just such a funny,"
02:00:33;02:00:35;"weird mix of emotions."
02:00:35;02:00:38;"You know, a dreaded summer day, so I'll meet you at the cemetery gates."
02:00:38;02:00:43;"But I always just think about that image of him or the narrator"
02:00:43;02:00:46;"being in the graveyard, and just looking at all these graves"
02:00:46;02:00:49;"and thinking about all these people and everything that happened"
02:00:49;02:00:52;"in their lives and how they lived and how they died."
02:00:52;02:00:54;"And then he goes, ""It's so unfair."
02:00:54;02:00:56;"I want to cry."""
02:00:56;02:00:59;"In that Morrissey way where you're like, it almost sounds, like, ironic."
02:00:59;02:01:01;"Right, do you?"
02:01:01;02:01:04;"Whether he's being a little bit ironic or not,"
02:01:04;02:01:07;"it is just, like, this interesting point that everybody feels sometimes"
02:01:07;02:01:09;"when you're in a graveyard."
02:01:09;02:01:11;"You're walking around, you know, you're probably going to leave"
02:01:11;02:01:15;"and go to 7-Eleven, later get a hot dog, you're going to go back to your life."
02:01:15;02:01:17;"You're just sitting in this place, you look at the dates,"
02:01:17;02:01:19;"especially if you're in, like, a really big one,"
02:01:19;02:01:23;"and you see, you know, all sorts of brutal [bleep] like a child's grave."
02:01:23;02:01:24;"Yeah."
02:01:24;02:01:27;"Or as we've talked about on the show, that sometimes when it shows"
02:01:27;02:01:31;"where somebody was born, you know, if I, like, go to, like, where my--"
02:01:31;02:01:35;"some of my grandparents are buried in, like, this, you know,"
02:01:35;02:01:38;"giant Jewish cemetery in New Jersey, and you might see some graves"
02:01:38;02:01:41;"where somebody was born, like, 1897 in Poland,"
02:01:41;02:01:44;"and you're just, like, literally surrounded by death,"
02:01:44;02:01:46;"and you're thinking about all these lives and all these things"
02:01:46;02:01:50;"that these people did, and now it's just, you know,"
02:01:50;02:01:52;"here in the cold ground."
02:01:52;02:01:54;"There's something interesting about that, too, just, like,"
02:01:54;02:01:58;"if you want to give her some credit that this song is a little bit about, like,"
02:01:58;02:02:02;"just, like, the weirdness of life, that she tells the whole story"
02:02:02;02:02:05;"of this woman's life, and then it was bought by me."
02:02:05;02:02:07;"A whole life, all this drama."
02:02:07;02:02:08;"Yeah."
02:02:08;02:02:10;"This guy, her husband died, and it must have been so shocking,"
02:02:10;02:02:12;"and on top of that, people were giving her [bleep]"
02:02:12;02:02:15;"It reminds me of that kind of, like, that Morrissey-esque,"
02:02:15;02:02:18;"like, all these people live, now they are dead."
02:02:18;02:02:19;"It's so unfair."
02:02:19;02:02:22;"Just, like, that kind of, like, a banal statement about how life"
02:02:22;02:02:26;"is simultaneously, like, epic and also just, like, so banal."
02:02:26;02:02:27;"Meaningless."
02:02:27;02:02:31;"You live an entire lifetime, and then one day, there's just, like,"
02:02:31;02:02:34;"some goth teenager in Manchester dancing on your grave"
02:02:34;02:02:37;"and, like, waxing poetic about you."
02:02:37;02:02:40;"Or you live this entire crazy life, and then all those memories"
02:02:40;02:02:43;"in that house are just, like, stories."
02:02:43;02:02:44;"Somebody else buys it."
02:02:44;02:02:45;"Boom."
02:02:45;02:02:47;"It's heavy."
02:02:47;02:02:50;"I will say, going deep on this song makes me way more interested"
02:02:50;02:02:53;"in, like, going deep on the album."
02:02:53;02:02:55;"The truth is, I really just know her singles."
02:02:55;02:02:57;"I've always been very moved by ""Blank Space."""
02:02:57;02:03:00;"We've talked about that many times on the show."
02:03:00;02:03:02;"That's my favorite Taylor song."
02:03:02;02:03:06;"But I'm curious about, like, this album's called ""Folklore."""
02:03:06;02:03:08;"It's her in the woods on the cover."
02:03:08;02:03:10;"This song's called ""The Last Great American Dynasty."""
02:03:10;02:03:11;"There's a pretty good--"
02:03:11;02:03:12;"I'm, like, interested--"
02:03:12;02:03:14;"I was going to say, there's a pretty good song on the album"
02:03:14;02:03:17;"called ""August,"" which has, like, a real, like, Paula Cole,"
02:03:17;02:03:19;"like, '90s vibe."
02:03:19;02:03:20;"Oh, cool."
02:03:20;02:03:23;"The lyrics were just sort of innocuous, but, like, the melodies"
02:03:23;02:03:26;"and the production, I was, like--"
02:03:26;02:03:27;"I was feeling that one."
02:03:27;02:03:29;"OK, I'm going to check that out."
02:03:29;02:03:32;"But this [BLEEP] does make me interested in, like--"
02:03:32;02:03:35;"there is a classic type of American pop songwriter who's"
02:03:35;02:03:37;"really interested in American history."
02:03:37;02:03:38;"Mm-hmm."
02:03:38;02:03:41;"You know, and they're interested in the way that the history haunts"
02:03:41;02:03:45;"the present and stuff, and that even these guys in the '60s and '70s,"
02:03:45;02:03:49;"these people who would dig into, like, stories from, you know,"
02:03:49;02:03:52;"the 19th century and, like, the old weird America,"
02:03:52;02:03:54;"obviously, they weren't just being retro."
02:03:54;02:03:58;"They saw a weird way that that had something to say about the present"
02:03:58;02:04:00;"or what it means to be American or what--"
02:04:00;02:04:03;"you know, how we got to our modern condition."
02:04:03;02:04:07;"I respect that there's, like, a modern pop song by one of the biggest"
02:04:07;02:04:11;"pop stars that involves some, like, American history."
02:04:11;02:04:12;"Oh, hell yeah."
02:04:12;02:04:15;"I wonder what the rest of the album has to say about that."
02:04:15;02:04:18;"But you know, folklore, last great American dynasty,"
02:04:18;02:04:21;"she's clearly got, like, an interest in, like,"
02:04:21;02:04:23;"positioning herself as a modern American."
02:04:23;02:04:25;"What does that mean?"
02:04:25;02:04:27;"All right, well, that was fun to go deep on one song."
02:04:27;02:04:29;"We haven't done that in a long time."
02:04:29;02:04:30;"Yeah."
02:04:30;02:04:33;"I think we need to keep coming up with new ideas to keep TC fresh"
02:04:33;02:04:36;"because we were saying to each other during one of the breaks,"
02:04:36;02:04:40;"this quarantine [bleep] getting kind of old on a lot of levels."
02:04:40;02:04:43;"Living in the phone world, we need to get back in the physical world."
02:04:43;02:04:46;"I want to play physical Scrabble."
02:04:46;02:04:48;"I want to do physical time crisis."
02:04:48;02:04:50;"Have a physical release."
02:04:50;02:04:52;"Physical TC."
02:04:52;02:04:54;"Yeah, not like you Zoomers with your virtual TC."
02:04:54;02:04:56;"Physical release."
02:04:56;02:05:00;"Do we do the social distancing episode where we're, like,"
02:05:00;02:05:02;"20 feet apart with real microphones?"
02:05:02;02:05:04;"Is that, like, in the park?"
02:05:04;02:05:05;"On the deck?"
02:05:05;02:05:06;"Crazy?"
02:05:06;02:05:08;"Yeah, that doesn't seem crazy, right?"
02:05:08;02:05:09;"We got to run that up the flagpole."
02:05:09;02:05:11;"Tim Cook's got to sign off on that."
02:05:11;02:05:13;"Yeah, that's going to take about three months' worth of red tape"
02:05:13;02:05:15;"to work through."
02:05:15;02:05:19;"We need written approval from Governor Newsom."
02:05:19;02:05:24;"But truly, we could easily get some long mic cables and sit six feet apart."
02:05:24;02:05:25;"Yeah."
02:05:25;02:05:26;"Do it outside."
02:05:26;02:05:27;"I love it."
02:05:27;02:05:28;"I think we need it."
02:05:28;02:05:31;"I think we need to inject some physicality back into time crisis."
02:05:31;02:05:33;"We're at almost five months."
02:05:33;02:05:34;"Yeah."
02:05:34;02:05:35;"It's messed up, man."
02:05:35;02:05:39;"Yeah, maybe if Apple's down, they want to get us to everybody gets tested,"
02:05:39;02:05:42;"we maybe get a PJ, we fly out to Newport."
02:05:42;02:05:45;"We could do it at the holiday house."
02:05:45;02:05:46;"All right."
02:05:46;02:05:47;"Good seeing everybody."
02:05:47;02:05:50;"Hope everybody listening is doing all right."
02:05:50;02:05:51;"We'll see you guys in two weeks."
02:05:51;02:05:52;"Peace."
02:05:52;02:05:56;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
02:05:56;02:05:59;"(electronic music)"
