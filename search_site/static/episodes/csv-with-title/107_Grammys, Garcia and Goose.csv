00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis, back one more time for 2019."
00:06;00:09;"That's right, it's the final show of the season."
00:09;00:16;"The gang unites for one last episode where we talk about everything from Fish to Goose"
00:16;00:22;"to the Grateful Dead, plus a rundown of this year's Grammys."
00:22;00:26;"All that, plus the ongoing fall of Seinfeld."
00:26;00:31;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:31;00:35;"B-B-B-B-B-B-Beast War One."
01:21;01:24;"Time Crisis, back once again."
01:24;01:26;"We got just about everybody in the room."
01:26;01:27;"Full house."
01:27;01:28;"Seinfeld back."
01:28;01:29;"Hey, what's up?"
01:29;01:31;"[laughs]"
01:31;01:32;"Everybody's here."
01:32;01:35;"You know, just before we get into the topics of the day,"
01:35;01:37;"we got a lot to catch up on because we had some banked eps."
01:37;01:38;"Right."
01:38;01:39;"We had Gratefulsgiving."
01:39;01:44;"Wasn't there something in that episode which we recorded a few weeks ago?"
01:44;01:48;"We talked about how Thanksgiving, the word is played out, thankful is played out,"
01:48;01:50;"and grateful is a much deeper word."
01:50;01:55;"And then wasn't there something that Trump said some nutty thing about how people don't like the name Thanksgiving?"
01:55;01:56;"Oh, yeah."
01:56;01:57;"What did he say?"
01:57;01:58;"I missed that."
01:58;01:59;"Oh, wow."
01:59;02:03;"Trump claims that some people want to change the name of Thanksgiving."
02:03;02:06;"Oh, and those people are like bad liberals, like his enemies?"
02:06;02:07;"Yeah."
02:07;02:12;"So Washington Post said that Trump at his rally around the end of November"
02:12;02:17;"declared he would resist efforts by ""some people"" to change the name of Thanksgiving."
02:17;02:18;"Whoa, subtweet."
02:18;02:19;"Whoa."
02:19;02:20;"That's completely you."
02:20;02:25;"Is he talking about people who are like kind of calling it out similarly to Columbus Day maybe"
02:25;02:27;"to recognize indigenous people?"
02:27;02:28;"I'm sure that's what it is."
02:28;02:29;"He's like vague as ever."
02:29;02:31;"Or he might be talking about Gratefulsgiving."
02:31;02:35;"He said people have different ideas why it shouldn't be called Thanksgiving,"
02:35;02:39;"but everybody in this room knows that I know loves the name Thanksgiving, and we're not changing it."
02:39;02:44;"That actually sounds like more like it's directed at us because people who want to cancel Thanksgiving,"
02:44;02:48;"so to speak, and say this should be understandably a supportive--"
02:48;02:51;"people who say we should recognize this as an indigenous people's day,"
02:51;02:53;"they're not talking about renaming Thanksgiving."
02:53;02:55;"They're talking about ending Thanksgiving."
02:55;02:59;"The only people I've heard about who are talking about renaming Thanksgiving are us."
02:59;03:00;"That's true."
03:00;03:02;"Who wants to, I mean, end it?"
03:02;03:04;"I mean it's a day off from work."
03:04;03:07;"It's fun to, like, cook food with your family, right?"
03:07;03:08;"Who wants to end it?"
03:08;03:09;"That's not--"
03:09;03:10;"Well--"
03:10;03:11;"That's not fun."
03:11;03:12;"It is a Native American issue."
03:12;03:16;"Apparently some Native Americans would like to change the name to National Day of Mourning."
03:16;03:19;"I understand that perspective because if you're going to call it National Day of Mourning,"
03:19;03:22;"it doesn't make a lot of sense to be like,"
03:22;03:26;"""All right, but we can still get the family together to throw on the game and cook up some good food."""
03:26;03:27;"It's like--"
03:27;03:29;"On this National Day of Mourning?"
03:29;03:30;"Yeah."
03:30;03:34;"You kind of got to move the day off from work to a different day, I think."
03:34;03:35;"Yeah."
03:35;03:36;"I feel that."
03:36;03:42;"Anyway, I was just telling Jake before you got here, Seinfeld, that I was just texting with CT"
03:42;03:46;"because we're talking about this Jerry Garcia auction happening."
03:46;03:48;"Oh, what's on the block?"
03:48;03:50;"Well, it's a lot of comic books."
03:50;03:53;"The first few lots are comic books."
03:53;03:55;"These are a lot of 1950s comics."
03:55;03:56;"Was he a big collector?"
03:56;03:57;"Seems like it."
03:57;04:02;"He had 45 issues of EC Comics' The Haunt of Fear."
04:02;04:05;"Oh, yeah, there's a bunch of Mad magazines."
04:05;04:06;"That's kind of tight."
04:06;04:08;"Okay, I can see that a little more."
04:08;04:09;"Vault of Horror."
04:09;04:11;"Weird Science and Weird Science Fantasy."
04:11;04:13;"Tales from the Crypt."
04:13;04:17;"I mean, this could be cool, a Jerry Garcia group of 39 underground comics"
04:17;04:22;"because that's kind of his era, you know, like Zap, R. Crumb, the funky San Francisco stuff."
04:22;04:27;"I think the big thing people are excited about is one of his guitars called Alligator."
04:27;04:28;"But there's some cool stuff in here."
04:28;04:29;"How about this, Jake?"
04:29;04:32;"A Jerry Garcia two-sided test pressing for working man's debt."
04:32;04:35;"They think that might only go for $200 to $400."
04:35;04:37;"Is there a buy now price?"
04:37;04:38;"I don't think they do buy now."
04:38;04:39;"Wait, check this out, Jake."
04:39;04:44;"A Jerry Garcia gold sales award for the Grateful Dead album Europe 72."
04:44;04:46;"Expected to go between $6,000 and $8,000."
04:46;04:47;"Oh, this is funny."
04:47;04:51;"Now a gold record is $500,000 sales."
04:51;04:53;"Or now there's equivalents with streams."
04:53;04:56;"But back in the day, I'm zooming in on it, it says,"
04:56;05:00;"""Presented to Jerry Garcia to commemorate the sale of more than $1 million worth"
05:00;05:06;"of the Warner Brothers Records long-playing record album Europe 72."""
05:06;05:08;"Just straight up cash."
05:08;05:11;"I wonder what that retailed for back in '72, '73."
05:11;05:12;"Double record?"
05:12;05:13;"I think it was a triple."
05:13;05:14;"Oh, you're right."
05:14;05:15;"It was a triple."
05:15;05:16;"That's a lot."
05:16;05:20;"I'm going to guess $699 back in '72, '73."
05:20;05:21;"That's a lot of sales."
05:21;05:22;"This is pretty cool."
05:22;05:24;"A Jerry Garcia test pressing for the album Garcia."
05:24;05:28;"Annotated on the cover with a drawing in Garcia's hand."
05:28;05:30;"They're thinking this is going to be $1,500 to $2,500."
05:30;05:32;"It's like some little Jerry doodles."
05:32;05:34;"And then a test pressing of Garcia."
05:34;05:36;"I don't get the rock ephemera thing."
05:36;05:38;"Well, are you a collector of anything?"
05:38;05:39;"I have been."
05:39;05:42;"When I was a kid, baseball cards and comics."
05:42;05:47;"Well, Jake, also when I was talking about how there are a lot of Jerry Garcia's comics"
05:47;05:54;"going up for auction, Jake made a joke about a 1990 copy of Punisher War Journal"
05:54;05:56;"belonging to Jerry Garcia."
05:56;06:01;"And I was really taken aback because Punisher War Journal is a hyper-specific ref."
06:01;06:02;"I loved it when I was a kid."
06:02;06:05;"Because everybody knows Punisher, Frank Castle."
06:05;06:07;"And his renowned chain of burgers."
06:07;06:09;"His renowned chain of burgers."
06:09;06:10;"Punisher burgers."
06:10;06:12;"But so, Jake, you were reading."
06:12;06:15;"Let me get a number crunch on what Punisher War Journal is."
06:15;06:16;"Is it a limited series?"
06:16;06:18;"I think it's like Frank Miller."
06:18;06:19;"It ran for years."
06:19;06:23;"But you specifically were into Punisher colon War Journal."
06:23;06:24;"The art was better."
06:24;06:25;"Oh, yeah?"
06:25;06:28;"Whoever drew the Punisher War Journal was much better than Punisher."
06:28;06:30;"Is that what got you thinking about becoming an artist?"
06:30;06:31;"Oh, yeah."
06:31;06:32;"Comic books?"
06:32;06:33;"That was your first love?"
06:33;06:34;"Like copying from comic books?"
06:34;06:36;"Copying from Punisher War Journal."
06:36;06:37;"No joke."
06:37;06:38;"Wait."
06:38;06:39;"What was the last show called?"
06:39;06:40;"The Nino Meyer show?"
06:40;06:41;"Brick and Mortar."
06:41;06:42;"That was called Brick and Mortar."
06:42;06:44;"Next show, Jake Longstreth, War Journal."
06:44;06:51;"Punisher War Journal is the name of two comic book series from Marvel."
06:51;06:54;"Both centered around, obviously, The Punisher."
06:54;06:57;"First volume ran from '88 to '95."
06:57;06:59;"And then they did another series."
06:59;07:00;"Hell of a run."
07:00;07:02;"2007 to 2009."
07:02;07:04;"So you liked Punisher War Journal."
07:04;07:07;"You didn't like the more fantastical superheroes?"
07:07;07:08;"No, no, no."
07:08;07:09;"I'm a hard realist."
07:09;07:10;"You know that."
07:10;07:11;"No superpowers."
07:11;07:12;"You just want machine guns."
07:12;07:13;"Yeah."
07:13;07:14;"Raw violence."
07:14;07:15;"Absolutely."
07:15;07:16;"No."
07:16;07:17;"You notice that the series ran until '95."
07:17;07:18;"Pretty deep."
07:18;07:19;"Were you with it up to the end?"
07:19;07:22;"Well, I mean, maybe Jerry was a huge head."
07:22;07:23;"No."
07:23;07:24;"The same year he died."
07:24;07:26;"Word got back that he died."
07:26;07:30;"And the creators of Punisher War Journal were like, we're shutting this down."
07:30;07:31;"That'd be tight."
07:31;07:32;"That'd be so amazing."
07:32;07:38;"The complete Punisher War Journal first run from Jerry Garcia's archives."
07:38;07:42;"And then you flip open each one and just delicate handwriting."
07:42;07:47;"Him in his late 40s, early 50s, write, ""Please return to Jerry Garcia."""
07:47;07:52;"Address, Marin County, CA."

07:56;08:00;"♪ If you got nothing new to say ♪"
08:00;08:04;"♪ If you please don't back up the track ♪"

08:32;08:36;"♪ On a hill I heard him say ♪"
08:36;08:43;"♪ It's just as hard with the weight of lead ♪"
08:43;08:48;"The only comics they're putting up in this auction are from the 50s and 60s,"
08:48;08:55;"but I do love this idea that Jerry was keeping up with Punisher War Journal up until the end."
08:55;08:58;"Punisher War Journal is just like such an intense name."
08:58;08:59;"It's a great name."
08:59;09:03;"This kind of makes me want to read Punisher War Journal, because I was the opposite."
09:03;09:07;"I think I've said this before on the program that I was such a big X-Men fan,"
09:07;09:09;"kind of to the exclusion of all other--"
09:09;09:10;"Did you collect?"
09:10;09:11;"Yeah."
09:11;09:12;"You still have them?"
09:12;09:14;"I think they're in my parents' houses. I got to get them."
09:14;09:16;"Ezra Koenig auction."
09:16;09:21;"I had the complete run of something called The Age of Apocalypse,"
09:21;09:24;"which was a very fascinating moment when--"
09:24;09:28;"It's kind of convoluted, and maybe it played out in some of the movies,"
09:28;09:33;"but basically Professor X's son goes back in time and kills him,"
09:33;09:37;"creating a new timeline where Professor X, having died,"
09:37;09:40;"kind of anti-mutant sentiment takes over part of the world,"
09:40;09:44;"but also the mutants led by Apocalypse take over another part."
09:44;09:47;"It's cool. It's like an alternate universe, and like Magneto's a good guy."
09:47;09:51;"Anyway, it was a limited run across all the X-Men properties."
09:51;09:54;"Shout-out to anybody who worked on The Age of Apocalypse."
09:54;09:56;"But I was so into X-Men because I liked the vibe,"
09:56;09:59;"and I thought the way that they dealt with the concept of superpowers"
09:59;10:02;"made a lot of sense, but I'd see Punisher, and I'd just be like,"
10:02;10:04;"""This is mindless violence."""
10:04;10:05;"Bleak."
10:05;10:10;"Maybe now that I'm older, I understand that Punisher had a more accurate worldview."
10:10;10:11;"You understood that."
10:11;10:13;"Well, yeah. I mean, he was just a vigilante."
10:13;10:16;"It was just raw sorrow that drove him."
10:16;10:18;"You know one thing that I've been thinking?"
10:18;10:23;"This is classic TC, just picking up on an ice-cold news story."
10:23;10:24;"Let's crack that open."
10:24;10:26;"Maybe we talk about this a little bit on the show,"
10:26;10:29;"but you know there's this whole thing that Martin Scorsese said"
10:29;10:33;"he didn't like Marvel movies, and it upended American society."
10:33;10:34;"It really did."
10:34;10:35;"For about a month."
10:35;10:36;"Fully agree with the man."
10:36;10:37;"Everybody knows about this."
10:37;10:38;"And then--"
10:38;10:40;"This is ice-cold, by the way."
10:40;10:41;"Yeah."
10:41;10:44;"Although it was reignited a little bit because the Irishman finally hit Netflix."
10:44;10:45;"Right."
10:45;10:48;"So people were so infuriated."
10:48;10:53;"And to be fair to the offended parties, Scorsese didn't just say, ""They're not for me."""
10:53;10:56;"He said, ""They're not cinema,"" whatever that means."
10:56;10:57;"So you could understand--"
10:57;10:59;"He means like they're not high art."
10:59;11:01;"Yeah, he said they're like theme parks."
11:01;11:02;"Right."
11:02;11:03;"Which isn't the worst diss in the world."
11:03;11:04;"People like theme parks."
11:04;11:05;"Absolutely."
11:05;11:07;"He could have said, ""They're garbage. Theme parks are fun."""
11:07;11:10;"But so people got so upset, and it became this whole thing,"
11:10;11:14;"and then I feel like they were dragging Coppola into the mix."
11:14;11:17;"It became a thing that every serious director has to be asked about it,"
11:17;11:21;"and then the directors of the Marvel movies were so offended."
11:21;11:24;"James Gunn, who directed Guardians of the Galaxy,"
11:24;11:28;"he tweeted or posted something about how disappointed he was."
11:28;11:29;"Hey, I worked hard on that."
11:29;11:30;"Kind of."
11:30;11:32;"And then the Irishman came out."
11:32;11:35;"Yeah, now it's payback time, Marty."
11:35;11:36;"And from what I understand--"
11:36;11:38;"I actually haven't seen this with my own eyes,"
11:38;11:43;"but I've seen a lot of people saying, ""Oh, my God. Film Twitter is a mess,"""
11:43;11:47;"because the Irishman--also now anybody can watch it"
11:47;11:49;"because it's streaming on Netflix."
11:49;11:53;"So, you know, let's say you were offended by Marty's comments before."
11:53;11:55;"You might just not go see the film."
11:55;12:00;"But now it's a perfect storm because all these aggrieved Marvel fans"
12:00;12:04;"can throw on the first 15 minutes of Irishman just enough that they can say,"
12:04;12:07;"""I tried to watch it, but that guy [bleep] sucks."""
12:07;12:11;"But I just had a thought, and I'm sure somebody must have said this,"
12:11;12:13;"and I'm surprised that this wasn't a bigger part of it."
12:13;12:14;"And maybe this is on Scorsese."
12:14;12:17;"He didn't know what he was getting into, and even in his op-ed,"
12:17;12:20;"he didn't define his terms very clearly."
12:20;12:26;"But I think the easiest argument for why you might call a Scorsese movie cinema"
12:26;12:31;"and a Marvel movie not cinema would just be that I like stories"
12:31;12:38;"about people with the capacities and abilities of normal humans."
12:38;12:39;"Because the truth is--"
12:39;12:40;"Yeah, that's very my vibe."
12:40;12:43;"That doesn't neglect fantasy or sci-fi."
12:43;12:46;"You could make a movie that takes place on Mars."
12:46;12:48;"Humans have never set foot on Mars."
12:48;12:49;"Martian, great film."
12:49;12:50;"Yeah."
12:50;12:56;"You could make a movie about people going to a place that humans have never been at,"
12:56;12:58;"but you just don't give them superpowers."
12:58;12:59;"I actually buy that as an argument."
12:59;13:03;"I'm not saying I fully agree with it, but you could make the case that to him,"
13:03;13:05;"the definition of cinemas--and he did say something."
13:05;13:08;"It's about real human emotions and relationships."
13:08;13:14;"He could say, ""I just find the superpowers part muddies the waters a bit."""
13:14;13:17;"And he could say--you know, it's the same reason why people at first"
13:17;13:18;"were so into Game of Thrones."
13:18;13:20;"They're like, ""Okay, there are dragons."
13:20;13:25;"It does take place in a fantastical realm, but they're real people dealing with real [bleep]."""
13:25;13:27;"And for the most part, they are just normal human beings."
13:27;13:28;"Sure."
13:28;13:31;"There's the White Walkers and stuff, but the people are--"
13:31;13:32;"Mortal."
13:32;13:33;"Their people are mortal."
13:33;13:34;"I'd buy that."
13:34;13:39;"I'm not saying you can't read into a Marvel movie and take away--find something"
13:39;13:44;"that speaks to your humanity, but I could understand that as to draw a line in the sand"
13:44;13:48;"and say, ""I like human relationships where they're mere mortals."""
13:48;13:49;"What about Joker?"
13:49;13:52;"It's a superhero movie, but he doesn't have any special powers."
13:52;13:53;"That's cinema."
13:53;13:55;"Oh, and it's an homage to Scorsese."
13:55;13:57;"Mr. Scorsese, have you seen Joker?"
13:57;13:59;"I'm sure there are so many tweets like that."
13:59;14:02;"Mr. Scorsese, I implore you to see Joker."
14:02;14:08;"It is interesting--maybe this is a coincidence, but Batman is the only superhero that's purely"
14:08;14:13;"just a mortal human with no superpowers, and all those movies were made by auteur filmmakers--"
14:13;14:17;"Tim Burton, Christopher Nolan, whoever else."
14:17;14:18;"I don't know."
14:18;14:19;"But those are the two big ones."
14:19;14:20;"That's a good point."
14:20;14:21;"I don't know."
14:21;14:26;"Recently--guys, we're just catching you up on the past three months of comic book movie discourse."
14:26;14:27;"Really, the last 30 years."
14:27;14:29;"Kind of the last 30 years."
14:29;14:34;"Because I also saw there was some tweet that, again, people were fighting about, and who"
14:34;14:40;"knows if this is even true, that said the DCU--it really should be the DCCU, right?"
14:40;14:43;"Because it's the Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Comics."
14:43;14:46;"It should be the DC Cinematic Universe."
14:46;14:49;"Or it should be the DCCCU."
14:49;14:51;"The D-double-C-U?"
14:51;14:52;"D-triple-C."
14:52;14:53;"Triple-C."
14:53;14:54;"Oh, the D-triple-C."
14:54;14:55;"So the D-triple-C--"
14:55;14:56;"You."
14:57;14:59;"The DC Comics have said that they don't know what to do with Superman."
14:59;15:03;"And it's interesting that DC has Batman and Superman because they're opposites."
15:03;15:04;"Right."
15:04;15:09;"Batman is as mortal as it gets, whereas Superman is kind of like the--you know, as the name"
15:09;15:11;"implies, he's almost like the purest superhero."
15:11;15:13;"And he has an interesting backstory."
15:13;15:15;"He's an orphan."
15:15;15:16;"He's an immigrant."
15:16;15:17;"Had a hard life."
15:17;15:18;"He's had a hard life."
15:18;15:21;"But his powers are just, like, so out of control powerful."
15:21;15:22;"Tough to relate."
15:22;15:23;"Yeah."
15:23;15:24;"Never was a fan of Superman."
15:24;15:26;"Yeah, there's something about it that's not--"
15:26;15:29;"Just--it's corny, it's wholesome, it's aspirational."
15:29;15:30;"I don't like it."
15:30;15:34;"And I saw some people being like, ""Well, oh, you're telling me that Superman, an orphaned"
15:34;15:38;"immigrant in a society that doesn't understand him, people can't relate to that?"""
15:38;15:41;"And I was kind of thinking, like, ""Yeah, I don't think so."""
15:41;15:46;"I think he probably--there have been so many movies that deal with those issues probably"
15:46;15:47;"a little more accurately."
15:47;15:51;"You know a movie that deals with the immigrants making their way into a society that doesn't"
15:51;15:52;"understand them?"
15:52;15:53;"The Irishman."
15:53;15:54;"Oh, yeah."
15:54;15:56;"Did you like The Irishman, Ezra?"
15:56;15:57;"Did you see it?"
15:57;15:58;"I loved it."
15:58;15:59;"Yeah."
15:59;16:00;"I saw it in the theater."
16:00;16:01;"It was great."
16:01;16:02;"Yeah, I saw it in the theater, too."
16:02;16:03;"Which you kind of need to do."
16:03;16:05;"I would have stopped it, like, four times if I watched it at home."
16:05;16:06;"I know."
16:06;16:08;"And I will watch it again at some point, but I will also stop it four times."
16:08;16:11;"I can't imagine just watching that on your laptop."
16:11;16:13;"Like, holding a [bleep]"
16:13;16:14;"Yeah."
16:14;16:16;"Like, in the theater, the last hour, I was just holding a [bleep]"
16:16;16:19;"And then just--but, like, doing that at home would be so tight."
16:19;16:21;"Just, like, pushing start, not going to stop it."
16:21;16:23;"Babe, I'm watching The Irishman."
16:23;16:24;"Don't open the door."
16:24;16:25;"Do not open the door."
16:25;16:28;"And if you see me open the door to use the bathroom--"
16:28;16:29;"Reprimand me."
16:29;16:30;"Reprimand."
17:42;17:57;"You forgot Iron Man, also, is a man--a superhero without the superpowers."
17:57;17:58;"Oh, it's just the suit?"
17:58;18:04;"It's--yeah, he's-- Robert Downey Jr. doesn't have any special, like, radioactive blood or anything like that."
18:04;18:05;"Right."
18:05;18:06;"He has money. He's like Batman."
18:06;18:07;"Right, he kind of is. Yeah, you're right."
18:07;18:10;"There is something interesting about Iron Man, I guess."
18:10;18:12;"Yeah, he seems like a Batman ripoff, though."
18:12;18:16;"Rich guy with, like, technological tools at his disposal."
18:16;18:19;"He does it himself, though. He does it. He's got the engineering skills."
18:19;18:21;"He's not like Alfred. Like, who makes Batman?"
18:21;18:25;"No, it's like Morgan Freeman makes all of Batman's special tech."
18:25;18:26;"Right."
18:26;18:31;"And then, you know, you got Downey Jr.'s in there with his elbow, you know, his sleeves rolled up, turning screws and--"
18:31;18:32;"Yeah, elbow grease."
18:32;18:34;"Yeah, yeah, putting in some classic elbow grease."
18:34;18:36;"This is full comics talk."
18:36;18:38;"I mean, we got into this because of Jerry's collection."
18:38;18:41;"Okay, right. So, actually, it's pretty connected to classic TC stuff."
18:41;18:43;"Well, also, when you look through Jerry's collection--"
18:43;18:47;"It does go back to the Grateful Dead, so don't worry, listeners of the show."
18:47;18:53;"Look, I'm not saying that this is indicative of Jerry's entire comic collection,"
18:53;18:58;"because for all we know, they've been doing, you know, auctioning this stuff off little by little."
18:58;19:01;"Big fan of Wolverine."
19:01;19:05;"Wolverine is tight because he's almost a normal guy just with claws."
19:05;19:06;"But I--"
19:06;19:07;"Big fan of Spawn."
19:07;19:09;"But actually, when you look through Jerry's collection--"
19:09;19:10;"It's the funny stuff."
19:10;19:16;"Well, it's funny stuff, but it's also, like, shock, suspense, it's also just, like, classic, like, horror and gore."
19:16;19:20;"It's not that specific superhero genre. I'm not seeing a lot of superheroes in here."
19:20;19:22;"You see some Spider-Man in there?"
19:22;19:23;"Oh, I didn't see this one."
19:23;19:26;"Okay, I was totally wrong. I missed this lot."
19:26;19:28;"There's so many lots of his comics."
19:28;19:30;"Why would you want this?"
19:30;19:34;"Because you're a Grateful Dead fan, Jake, which I thought you were."
19:34;19:35;"Okay, so there is a lot--"
19:35;19:39;"It's so removed from his artistic achievement at that point."
19:39;19:47;"It's just sort of like, ""Jerry's cookbook collection. Jerry's copy of Joy of Cooking. Cool."""
19:47;19:52;"I mean, it helps you understand where he was coming from, you know?"
19:52;19:53;"This is his--"
19:53;19:55;"""Jerry's copy of the Oxford English Dictionary."""
19:55;19:56;"There you go."
19:56;20:00;"With the little magnifying glass included."
20:00;20:08;"""Lot 312 in this auction is a Jerry Garcia group of 66 assorted DC/Marvel comics, 1960s through 1980s."""
20:08;20:10;"I want to know about that '80s stuff."
20:10;20:15;"Wait. Okay, in the picture, you can see Spider-Man, there is some Captain America."
20:15;20:18;"That could totally be a dead song, ""Captain America."""
20:18;20:19;"Oh, yeah, like in U.S. blues?"
20:19;20:20;"Yeah."
20:20;20:22;"♪ Captain America ♪"
20:22;20:25;"♪ Captain America ♪"
20:25;20:27;"I feel like this one might be Alpha Force, which is really--"
20:27;20:28;"Do you know who Alpha Force is?"
20:28;20:29;"No, what's that?"
20:29;20:31;"They were like the Canadian Avengers."
20:31;20:39;"Oh, wait. You got Doctor Strange, John Carter, Amazing Spider-Man, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Marvel Team-Up, Solo Adventures, Conan the Barbarian, Alpha Flight."
20:39;20:42;"Yeah, Alpha Flight was the Canadian Avengers."
20:42;20:48;"Manhunter 2070, Swamp Thing, Green Lantern, and Strange Sports."
20:48;20:50;"Okay, so Jerry was a full-on comic, too."
20:50;20:54;"Strange Sports? Is it a precursor to Juice Island?"
20:54;20:56;"Strange Sports, man."
20:56;21:00;"Too bad Jerry is not allowed to chime in on the Scorsese-Marvel thing."
21:00;21:02;"Jerry, what do you think about this?"
21:02;21:03;"Oh, man."
21:03;21:07;"You know what, man? Movies are movies."
21:07;21:10;"One of these Canadian Avengers turns into a Sasquatch?"
21:10;21:15;"I think I had one or two Alpha Flight comics, and I remember being like, ""This sucks, but it's kind of hilarious that it exists."""
21:15;21:19;"I think one of the guys has a big maple leaf on his outfit."
21:19;21:21;"I think that's the leader of the crew."
21:21;21:23;"Wait, what are the names of the people in Alpha Flight?"
21:23;21:31;"It's Guardian, North Star, Aurora, Sasquatch, Shaman, and Snowbird."
21:31;21:34;"Those last two characters are native Canadians."
21:34;21:35;"Very cultural."
21:35;21:36;"Oh, indigenous people."
21:36;21:37;"Indigenous."
21:37;21:38;"I wonder if they ever get into that."
21:38;21:41;"I mean, there's an Inuit demi-goddess from Yellowknife?"
21:41;21:42;"This is deep."
21:42;21:45;"All just fighting to protect the interests of Canada?"
21:45;21:46;"I don't know what their mission is, yeah."
21:46;21:51;"I wonder if a hardcore Canadian comics person is just like, ""You know what? Alpha Flight's for Americans."""
21:51;21:55;"We never felt like that depicted our true indigenous superhero culture."
21:55;21:59;"Jake, would you be interested in a piece of art that Jerry made?"
21:59;22:00;"I'd have to see it."
22:00;22:01;"Oh, here."
22:01;22:02;"Yeah, there's a bunch of drawings and stuff."
22:02;22:03;"Hard pass."
22:03;22:06;"This, to me, is the strangest thing I've seen."
22:06;22:08;"He has a signed photograph of Larry Bird."
22:08;22:09;"Oh, yeah. I did see that."
22:09;22:10;"But that's interesting."
22:10;22:14;"You're basically selling someone else's memorabilia."
22:14;22:15;"That's sports memorabilia."
22:15;22:17;"It's not Jerry Garcia memorabilia."
22:17;22:18;"But it's signed to Jerry."
22:18;22:19;"What does it say?"
22:19;22:20;"""Dear Jerry."""
22:20;22:22;"It says, ""To Jerry. Best, Larry Bird."""
22:22;22:24;"That's a cool hangout."
22:24;22:25;"Yeah."
22:25;22:26;"Bird and Garcia."
22:26;22:29;"Because in the Dead, didn't we read about this or something?"
22:29;22:32;"Like, the Dead went to see the Celtics practice."
22:32;22:34;"Because of Bill Walden?"
22:34;22:35;"Right. Okay."
22:35;22:37;"There's also a pair of Grateful Dead shorts."
22:37;22:40;"Probably the most hilarious thing in the lot is just black T-shirt."
22:40;22:43;"Owned and worn by Jerry Garcia."
22:43;22:47;"There's some guitar straps. That's kind of cool."
22:47;22:48;"That I could see more."
22:48;22:51;"How about a Hawaiian shirt owned and worn by Jerry Garcia?"
22:51;22:53;"No, man. How much? $800?"
22:53;22:56;"A plaid shirt worn by Jerry. $300 to $500?"
22:56;22:58;"There's just something about that that's just sad."
22:58;22:59;"A drawing of John Wayne."
22:59;23:01;"Yikes."
23:01;23:02;"I'm not down with this."
23:02;23:04;"This one's kind of funky. A drawing of an alien."
23:04;23:06;"That's kind of cool and weird."
23:06;23:09;"Would you wear the Hawaiian shirt around?"
23:09;23:11;"No, I think you've got to get it framed."
23:11;23:12;"Okay, this is it."
23:12;23:14;"This is the black T-shirt."
23:14;23:18;"Black T-shirt owned and worn by Jerry Garcia circa 1990."
23:18;23:22;"They're thinking that's going to go for between $1,000 and $1,500."
23:22;23:27;"Some guy wearing that around and then being like, ""Check out my shirt, man."""
23:27;23:32;"His friends are like, ""Yeah? What's up? You're wearing a black T-shirt? Yeah."
23:32;23:34;"Do you want to know the backstory?"""
23:34;23:36;"Sure. Jerry Garcia owned this."
23:36;23:38;"You know what it is? It's John Voight's car."
23:38;23:40;"Right? Totally."
23:40;23:43;"It's a point of pride taken from the previous owner."
23:43;23:46;"Jerry owned this shirt. He wore it in 1990."
23:46;23:48;"Spring '90 to her."
23:48;23:49;"Just waiting for--"
23:49;23:50;"Oh, that's cool, man."
23:50;23:51;"Smell it."
23:51;23:53;"How much did you spend on that? $1,000?"
23:53;23:55;"[laughter]"
23:55;23:56;"Cool, man."
23:56;24:01;"Just waiting for somebody to say, ""Yo, dude, what's the backstory on that black T-shirt you're wearing?"""
24:01;24:04;"No one would ever ask that question in a million years."
24:04;24:07;"You have to awkwardly bring it up."
24:07;24:09;"What do you guys think of my shirt?"
24:09;24:10;"Black shirt."
24:10;24:11;"Is it a black T-shirt?"
24:11;24:15;"Well, you know what? If you're a real small skinny dude, because Jerry was on the bigger side in that era--"
24:15;24:16;"Oh, there you go."
24:16;24:18;"So you could be this small skinny dude."
24:18;24:21;"You buy this XL black shirt and somebody would be like--"
24:21;24:23;"Double XL baggy."
24:23;24:25;"Maybe. Somebody's just like, ""Yo, dude."""
24:25;24:27;"That's a different look for you."
24:27;24:29;"That's a different look for you. That shirt's huge."
24:29;24:31;"Yeah, it's not originally mine."
24:31;24:32;"Glad you asked."
24:32;24:34;"It's not originally-- No, you could try to be cool about it."
24:34;24:36;"You're just like, ""Oh, well, yeah, it's not originally mine."
24:36;24:40;"Somebody a bit bigger than me owned it originally."""
24:40;24:42;"Was it your dad's shirt?"
24:42;24:44;"Yeah, it was like, ""Hand me down for somebody in your family?"""
24:44;24:47;"No, no, I've actually never met the person."
24:47;24:48;"But it does have sentimental value."
24:48;24:50;"Yeah, what do you mean? You got it at a thrift store?"
24:50;24:53;"Oh, no, no, no. I actually paid $1,000 for this."
24:53;24:56;"Oh, was it like some sort of benefit? Like some sort of charity auction?"
24:56;24:58;"It was an auction of sorts."
24:58;25:00;"Why is this person being so coy about it?"
25:00;25:02;"Why is it-- Why?"
25:02;25:04;"Why all the questions?"
25:04;25:06;"I just think because they--"
25:06;25:09;"Maybe it's just somebody who's too proud to bring it up themselves."
25:09;25:12;"For you to just drag it out of them."
25:12;25:13;"Yeah."
25:13;25:16;"I think there's also something tight about just walking into somebody's house"
25:16;25:20;"and just like with no info just a big black T-shirt framed"
25:20;25:24;"in like a gorgeous ornate gold-leafed frame."
25:24;25:25;"Oh, yeah."
25:25;25:27;"Would his DNA have survived on that shirt?"
25:27;25:28;"You know, like--"
25:28;25:29;"It's very possible."
25:29;25:31;"Wait, are you suggesting we should clone Jerry Garcia?"
25:31;25:35;"Maybe I'm suggesting a Jurassic Park-esque premise."
25:35;25:36;"Have we talked about that before?"
25:36;25:37;"I think we did the--"
25:37;25:39;"Joked about the rock and roll Jurassic Park."
25:39;25:40;"There we go."
25:40;25:41;"Where we clone everybody?"
25:41;25:42;"Yeah."
25:42;25:44;"And it's like a bunch of billionaires after dinner and be like,"
25:44;25:48;"""Gentlemen, after dinner, Jerry Garcia will be jamming with Jimi Hendrix."""
25:48;25:51;"It's like the island of Dr. Moreau or something."
25:51;25:52;"The shirt is tempting."
25:52;25:54;"I think a guitar strap could be cool."
25:54;25:55;"Yeah, the guitar--"
25:55;25:57;"It depends how much it is."
25:57;25:59;"Maybe I'm putting a bit on these shorts."
25:59;26:00;"You see these ones?"
26:00;26:04;"A pair of Grateful Dead tour shorts because it actually says Grateful Dead on it."
26:04;26:05;"Pretty sick."
26:05;26:06;"Get those framed."
26:06;26:07;"You'd have to wear them, dude."
26:07;26:08;"Play shows and all."
26:08;26:12;"There's mosquitoes on the river."
26:12;26:16;"Fish are rising up like birds."
26:16;26:19;"It's been hot for seven weeks now."
26:19;26:21;"Too hot to even speak now."
26:21;26:25;"Did you hear what I just heard?"
26:25;26:30;"Say it might have been the wind."
26:30;26:34;"Or it could have been the wind."
26:34;26:37;"But there seems to be a beatin'."
26:37;26:39;"I can feel it in my feet."
26:39;26:45;"Listen, here it comes again."
26:45;26:49;"There's a band out on the highway."
26:49;26:54;"Their house is hittin' every town."
26:54;26:57;"It's a rainbow full of sun."
26:57;27:01;"It's barbers, galopin', and clowns."
27:01;27:03;"Middle-aged dancing."
27:03;27:06;"Time Crisis on Beats 1."
27:06;27:08;"All right, you know what, everybody?"
27:08;27:09;"Strap in."
27:09;27:10;"It's going to be a lot of jam band stuff today."
27:10;27:12;"Shocker, I know."
27:12;27:14;"Well, we've been so dead-centric."
27:14;27:16;"We've never gone too deep."
27:16;27:17;"Dead and twiddle."
27:17;27:18;"Right."
27:18;27:20;"Dead and twiddle show."
27:20;27:23;"Well, by the way, I want to tell the TC community,"
27:23;27:25;"I've been telling everybody on our TC text thread,"
27:25;27:27;"and I'm sure some people know,"
27:27;27:29;"but I've been on tour quite a bit"
27:29;27:32;"since the last time we were here together in person."
27:32;27:33;"And off the top of my head,"
27:33;27:36;"I can think of at least three Mountain Bruise requests"
27:36;27:37;"that we've had."
27:37;27:38;"Incredible."
27:38;27:43;"One was at our only show on this whole tour in Germany,"
27:43;27:45;"which was in Cologne, Germany."
27:45;27:47;"And because, you know, we always do a request part of the show now,"
27:47;27:49;"and so somebody yelled out Mountain Bruise,"
27:49;27:50;"and we're like, oh, whoa,"
27:50;27:52;"because we hadn't played that since Red Rocks."
27:52;27:54;"So we're like, let's give it a try."
27:54;27:56;"I think we played about half of it."
27:56;27:58;"And then afterwards I was curious because,"
27:58;27:59;"especially in Europe, you know,"
27:59;28:01;"Europe people traveling country to country"
28:01;28:04;"is not as big a deal as in the U.S."
28:04;28:06;"And then, of course, you know,"
28:06;28:08;"when Vampire Weekend plays a show in Europe,"
28:08;28:11;"it's mostly like people from the country,"
28:11;28:14;"but it's totally classic to be like rolling out of the show,"
28:14;28:16;"you know, in Brussels,"
28:16;28:17;"and there's like a few Belgian people,"
28:17;28:20;"and then they're just like, yo, dude, huge fan."
28:20;28:22;"And just like, where are you from, man?"
28:22;28:24;"And just like, oh, you know, yeah, I'm from Jersey."
28:24;28:26;"I'm studying here."
28:26;28:27;"Or, you know, I got a job, whatever."
28:27;28:29;"You know, that happens a lot."
28:29;28:30;"So you never know."
28:30;28:31;"So I was like, oh, Mountain Bruise cover."
28:31;28:34;"I wonder if these people are maybe like, you know,"
28:34;28:35;"from the U.S. or something."
28:35;28:37;"So after we played it, I was like,"
28:37;28:38;"where are you guys from, by the way?"
28:38;28:41;"And they're just like, Frankfurt."
28:41;28:42;"That's epic."
28:42;28:44;"They jumped on the train, rolled out to Cologne for the show,"
28:44;28:45;"and requested Mountain Bruise."
28:45;28:46;"Epic."
28:46;28:48;"And then we got a couple at these acoustic shows we did."
28:48;28:51;"Well, I saw clips on Instagram of your Portland performance"
28:51;28:52;"of Mountain Bruise."
28:52;28:53;"Yeah."
28:53;28:54;"Sounded great."
28:54;28:55;"It was real reckoning."
28:55;28:56;"Oh, right."
28:56;28:57;"Acoustic and seated."
28:57;28:58;"Oh, yeah."
28:58;29:00;"Brian ripped a great solo, a great acoustic solo."
29:00;29:03;"So anyway, Mountain Bruise is still going strong."
29:03;29:05;"Can't wait for that mountain run next year."
29:05;29:06;"Oh, hell yeah, dude."
29:06;29:08;"The mountain run with Twiddle."
29:08;29:12;"All right, so, Jake, who or what is Goose,"
29:12;29:15;"and why are we about to talk to legendary rock journalist"
29:15;29:18;"Stephen Hyden about it slashing them?"
29:18;29:21;"Goose is a jam band from my home state."
29:21;29:23;"They're from Norwalk, Connecticut."
29:23;29:25;"The much maligned Connecticut."
29:25;29:29;"Yeah, obviously CT has a terrible track record musically."
29:29;29:30;"Oh, wait, by the way, real quick."
29:30;29:31;"So I'm glad that Goose--"
29:31;29:32;"Real quick sidebar."
29:32;29:33;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
29:33;29:36;"I heard a story from our boy Matt,"
29:36;29:38;"who works at our management company."
29:38;29:40;"He's part of our management team."
29:40;29:43;"And he checks into TC every now and then."
29:43;29:45;"And he was like, I got to tell you, man,"
29:45;29:46;"I had a really weird experience."
29:46;29:50;"I was driving in the car, me and my wife, and I throw it on."
29:50;29:53;"I just heard Jake going off on CT."
29:53;29:54;"I'm dumbfounded, man."
29:54;29:55;"What the hell, man?"
29:55;29:57;"And you're sitting there like half agreeing with him."
29:57;30:00;"You occasionally say, well, but I was just like,"
30:00;30:01;"what is going on, man?"
30:01;30:03;"And then, of course, he realized you were talking about"
30:03;30:06;"Connecticut, but he thought you were talking about Chris Tomlin."
30:06;30:07;"What was I saying?"
30:07;30:11;"CT is an incredible-- just a thin track record."
30:11;30:16;"I think-- imagine you're just like, CT, musically not up to snuff."
30:16;30:17;"Dropping the article."
30:17;30:20;"Yeah, just like-- yeah, what would you have said that"
30:20;30:22;"wouldn't have been clear, but I guess just like--"
30:22;30:23;"That's amazing."
30:23;30:25;"--just like, look, man, not a fan of CT."
30:25;30:27;"I got no loyalty to CT."
30:27;30:30;"Sorry if that's controversial, but I'm not down with CT."
30:30;30:32;"And I'm just like, well, you know, I see your point."
30:32;30:33;"CT is weak."
30:33;30:35;"Yeah."
30:35;30:38;"So maybe it was more like 10 seconds of just like, damn."
30:38;30:40;"You're just like, what is going on?"
30:40;30:42;"What did CT do to Jake?"
30:42;30:46;"Anyway, CT is the initials of Connecticut, not Chris Tomlin."
30:46;30:47;"Oh, my god."
30:47;30:48;"So yeah, you--"
30:48;30:49;"That rules."
30:49;30:51;"So you've always gone off about how Connecticut--"
30:51;30:52;"Does not pull its weight."
30:52;30:54;"--does not pull its weight in the tri-state area,"
30:54;30:55;"which I agree with."
30:55;30:58;"Yeah, I mean, come on, Jersey, New York."
30:58;31:01;"Also, on this last run, I realized I'm a big fan of"
31:01;31:02;"Philly and Pennsylvania."
31:02;31:03;"That's tight."
31:03;31:04;"But anyway--"
31:04;31:07;"There is a jam band out of Norwalk, Connecticut,"
31:07;31:08;"called Goose."
31:08;31:11;"And I didn't-- you know, I don't follow the jam band scene"
31:11;31:13;"closely at all."
31:13;31:16;"Stephen Heiden, sort of a friend on Twitter, hit me up."
31:16;31:17;"He's like, are you following Goose?"
31:17;31:21;"Because they are like the hot story in the jam band community"
31:21;31:22;"in 2019."
31:22;31:24;"And they're from CT."
31:24;31:28;"And so I immediately listened to their new single, ""Butter Rum."""
31:28;31:30;"[goose honking]"
31:30;31:31;"And what was your take?"
31:31;31:36;"It has kind of Jamflow Man vibes in that it's like pretty funny,"
31:36;31:40;"unclear on the intentionality behind the humor."
31:40;31:41;"It's like catchy."
31:41;31:44;"Well, I think all jam-- part of being a jam band is having"
31:44;31:45;"a sense of humor."
31:45;31:47;"I think all the classics do."
31:47;31:48;"Yeah."
31:48;31:51;"So I always feel like if you're unclear about if a jam band"
31:51;31:53;"is being a little funny with something,"
31:53;31:54;"I usually think they are."
31:54;31:55;"Yeah."
31:55;31:56;"I haven't heard--"
31:56;31:57;"No, no, yeah, I hear that."
31:57;31:58;"And you love the name."
31:58;32:00;"Goose is an incredible band name."
32:00;32:01;"That is a sick name."
32:01;32:02;"Goose is sick."
32:02;32:06;"Are you aware that there's another Goose band from Belgium?"
32:06;32:07;"Oh, uh-oh."
32:07;32:08;"An electronic rock band."
32:08;32:11;"It sounds like they're a bit of like a European imagination."
32:11;32:12;"Dragons."
32:12;32:14;"Goose versus Goose."
32:14;32:15;"Anyway, I think I just--"
32:15;32:18;"I think I just asked Steven if he wanted to call in and--"
32:18;32:19;"Well, I'm super curious."
32:19;32:21;"--and just kind of set the record straight about Goose"
32:21;32:22;"and hype it up a little bit."
32:22;32:24;"On paper, not having heard the music,"
32:24;32:29;"a jam band from Connecticut called Goose is 10 out of 10 for me already."
32:29;32:31;"But let's see what Haydn has to say."
32:31;32:32;"I'm also just curious about--"
32:32;32:34;"because we talked about it a little bit with Twiddle,"
32:34;32:36;"but the modern jam band scene--"
32:36;32:37;"Right."
32:37;32:38;"--I'm so curious about it."
32:38;32:39;"I don't follow this at all,"
32:39;32:42;"so I think maybe Steven can like clue us in on like the vibes."
32:42;32:43;"All right, cool."
32:43;32:46;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
32:46;32:50;"[phone ringing]"
32:50;32:51;"Hey, Steven, are you there?"
32:51;32:52;"Yeah, I'm here."
32:52;32:53;"Hey, Steven."
32:53;32:55;"Hey, Steven, welcome back to Time Crisis."
32:55;32:56;"Thanks for having me."
32:56;32:57;"I'm excited."
32:57;32:58;"So let's just get right into it, man."
32:58;33:01;"You hit Jake up on Twitter because you thought he'd be interested to know"
33:01;33:05;"that there's a poppin' jam band out of Connecticut called Goose."
33:05;33:07;"When did they get on your radar?"
33:07;33:11;"I first heard about them, it was probably late summer, early fall."
33:11;33:14;"It just seemed like overnight, like one day I'd never heard of them,"
33:14;33:19;"and then the next day, jam band Twitter was like a flutter with Goose talk."
33:19;33:23;"And it's really been like that for the last like three or four months."
33:23;33:26;"They started out almost like a meme,"
33:26;33:29;"like where it wasn't clear like whether people actually liked this band"
33:29;33:32;"or if they were like making fun of this band."
33:32;33:36;"But I think it's pretty clear at this point that there's like genuine excitement."
33:36;33:38;"They have like a show on like Ducks TV,"
33:38;33:40;"like they streamed one of their shows last month."
33:40;33:44;"They're going to be playing the Cancun, Mexico,"
33:44;33:47;"like Grateful Dead show that they do like in January."
33:47;33:51;"They're opening for Dead & Co. down in Mexico, down Mexico way?"
33:51;33:53;"I think what happens is like the Dead does a show,"
33:53;33:58;"and then there's like a late night show after, like an after party type thing."
33:58;33:59;"And I think Goose is doing that."
33:59;34:01;"So that's a pretty major cosign."
34:01;34:02;"Absolutely, absolutely."
34:02;34:04;"And it will be interesting to see."
34:04;34:08;"I'm sure that they're going to be getting a big bump from that in 2020."
34:08;34:10;"So have you gotten deep on the music?"
34:10;34:11;"I have."
34:11;34:14;"This band, I think one of the reasons that they've become so popular"
34:14;34:18;"like relatively quickly is that like they've marketed themselves like really well."
34:18;34:22;"You can go on Nugs.net and you can stream like every show"
34:22;34:23;"that they've played this year."
34:23;34:25;"It's like good quality sound."
34:25;34:29;"And you can go on YouTube and you can stream like three or four complete concerts"
34:29;34:32;"that are like pro shot and look really good."
34:32;34:36;"And then like I actually went on Bandcamp and like downloaded some stuff"
34:36;34:40;"because you can like pay seven bucks and download a show."
34:40;34:44;"I think I'm like a genuine Goose backer at this point."
34:44;34:46;"Is there a cool name for Goose fans?"
34:46;34:48;"You know, I knew you'd be asking this,"
34:48;34:51;"and this was something I researched because I didn't know this ahead of time."
34:51;34:55;"Apparently, The Flock is the name for Goose fans."
34:55;34:56;"Wait, wait, wait. Hold on."
34:56;34:59;"I thought The Flock was the pigeons playing ping pong fans."
34:59;35:00;"Let me get a number crunch."
35:00;35:03;"What do you call pigeons playing ping pong fans?"
35:03;35:07;"Yeah, The Flock is the official group name for pigeons playing ping pong."
35:07;35:09;"Fans, friends, and foes alike."
35:09;35:11;"We have two bands called Goose."
35:11;35:14;"We have two fan bases called The Flock."
35:14;35:15;"We've got some issues."
35:15;35:19;"I mean, it's possible because Goose really hasn't been like around that long."
35:19;35:23;"I think they've only been like with this lineup for a couple of years."
35:23;35:26;"They're sort of in the process of establishing themselves."
35:26;35:28;"Are they still based out of Connecticut?"
35:28;35:30;"I think so. I haven't heard otherwise."
35:30;35:31;"It's Norwalk, by the way."
35:31;35:34;"Is that like by where you grew up, Jake?"
35:34;35:36;"Yeah, I used to run cross-country races in Norwalk."
35:36;35:37;"Oh, yeah?"
35:37;35:38;"I'm very familiar."
35:38;35:41;"Because like with Goose and John Mayer both being from CT,"
35:41;35:43;"I feel like this is like the jam band."
35:43;35:48;"Like they've kind of cornered the market on like big jam bands constituencies at this point."
35:48;35:52;"Yeah, maybe Connecticut finally is asserting a type of musical identity."
35:52;35:53;"I guess I'll take it."
35:53;35:54;"This is--"
35:54;35:56;"I'm not happy about it, but I will take it."
35:56;35:57;"[laughs]"
35:57;36:00;"I don't know. You should lean into it."
36:00;36:05;"If you had to describe Goose's music in terms of the jam bands that we on TC are more familiar with,"
36:05;36:09;"are they leaning dead, leaning fish, leaning twiddle?"
36:09;36:12;"I would say they're definitely in the fish mold."
36:12;36:15;"And when you like listen to interviews with the band members,"
36:15;36:19;"it sounds like fish is like one of their main reference points."
36:19;36:23;"Like the guitar player named Rick, like he's talked about how like when he was in high school,"
36:23;36:24;"he was a fish fan."
36:24;36:28;"And then I think like in 2009, he was a senior in high school,"
36:28;36:31;"and that's when like fish came back from their hiatus."
36:31;36:34;"So that was like a pretty formative experience for him."
36:34;36:37;"And then The Breakers does it like a decade later."
36:37;36:40;"He's also talked about that being a big deal for him."
36:40;36:47;"So, you know, it's funny because there's like not actually like a lot of bands in that community that sound like fish."
36:47;36:50;"You would think that fish would be like a main sort of reference point,"
36:50;36:54;"but I actually think it's kind of a hard thing to replicate what they do."
36:54;37:01;"So I kind of feel like that's part of the excitement with this band is like they are reminiscent of like an early '90s fish."
37:01;37:06;"And like they're young, and it's like a young enough becoming band that people can get excited about."
37:06;37:12;"All right, well, Steve, in breaking news, Nick just handed me a article, I guess it's an interview,"
37:12;37:17;"and it says Mitterot, Tonda, and Atkin met at Berkeley School of Music in Boston."
37:17;37:19;"No shocker there."
37:19;37:24;"The biggest common musical influence between the two at the time was jazz rock like John Schofield and Madesky Martin Wood."
37:24;37:27;"He also lists a popular indie rock band as an inspiration."
37:27;37:29;"Vampire Weekend is one band that we are both very fond of."
37:29;37:33;"Okay, I'm sold."
37:33;37:39;"I'm not f*cking with Goose. Still haven't heard the music, but I already love the idea of Goose being from CT."
37:39;37:42;"Well, I feel like their self-described genre is indie groove."
37:42;37:43;"Not jam."
37:43;37:49;"Not jam. I remember seeing that somewhere on their website or something, which was a term that was new to me."
37:49;37:56;"Well, they talked about how, you know, unlike a lot of jam bands who are sort of going back to the '60s and '70s,"
37:56;38:02;"that, you know, these are guys in their 20s who grew up listening to music from like the 2000s and 2010s."
38:02;38:07;"So it wouldn't surprise me that Vampire Weekend, for instance, would be big on their radar."
38:07;38:13;"I know that Rick, the main guy, has talked about Bunny Bear being a big deal for him."
38:13;38:19;"And they've even like dabbled in like autotune on some of their songs, which is like a controversial thing."
38:19;38:20;"I noticed that."
38:20;38:29;"Yeah, it was kind of weird because they did this streaming show on NUGS TV, which was like a big deal in jam band Twitter circles."
38:29;38:35;"And he did a lot of like autotune in that performance. And it was kind of weird."
38:35;38:41;"Was it like Bunny Bear-esque autotune? Like stacked weird kind of experimental autotune?"
38:41;38:46;"It was kind of a weird comparison. It kind of reminded me of like the Cher autotune."
38:46;38:49;"Because they have like kind of an EDM dance element to what they do."
38:49;38:54;"And like there's a song that they do, I think it's called ""All I Need,"" which is like a very upbeat,"
38:54;38:58;"almost kind of dancey sounding rock song. And that's what they were doing it on."
38:58;39:03;"So that's definitely more of like a contemporary thing that they're bringing into jam band music."
39:03;39:07;"I mean, that is a whole world of jam stuff that I'm like vaguely familiar with."
39:07;39:14;"The kind of like Soundtribe Sector 9 and it basically is dance music, but that kind of lives more,"
39:14;39:17;"you know, it's at the same festivals as more traditional jam bands."
39:17;39:25;"Like obviously there's significant crossover in terms of fan base with like dubstep and certain forms of EDM and jam."
39:25;39:29;"Does it make sense that somebody would truly marry it? How's Goose's merch?"
39:29;39:38;"You know, this is a question I should have anticipated and investigated knowing what I was going on TC."
39:38;39:44;"You know, it's funny because like they really have kind of exploded, I think quicker than they expected this year."
39:44;39:50;"And I heard a podcast interview like where they were talking about how they're playing catch up in a lot of ways"
39:50;39:56;"with the size of their audience, because I don't know like how much merch they really have at this point."
39:56;40:01;"Like one of the guys said that like we're sort of in the process of assembling a crew right now,"
40:01;40:07;"because, you know, like they started selling out shows this fall, like at a much faster rate than they were before."
40:07;40:10;"It kind of seems like 2019 was like the beginning of their ascendance."
40:10;40:14;"And then like 2020 will be like their maybe blowout year."
40:14;40:18;"And then we'll know what kind of merch they have at that point."
40:18;40:22;"Well, I'm 100 percent still not having heard a note."
40:22;40:25;"I'm sold enough that 100 percent 2020, I'm going to go to a Goose show."
40:25;40:28;"Well, dude, they're playing Troubadour February 7th and 8th."
40:28;40:30;"Oh, really? We're going both nights."
40:30;40:32;"OK. Hell yeah. Stephen, come out."
40:32;40:37;"I will absolutely come out. It's a Friday and a Saturday. Goose weekend, dude."
40:37;40:43;"I'm going out to New York to see fish at MSG for like the New Year's Eve run."
40:43;40:46;"Yeah, first time I've ever done that. I've only been to MSG once."
40:46;40:49;"I've never seen fish there, so I'm really excited for that."
40:49;40:52;"That's amazing. I went to my first fish show last week and I heard about that."
40:52;40:55;"That was another discussion on Jam Van Twitter."
40:55;41:00;"Was you going to see fish? Because I think you talked about it on your social media."
41:00;41:03;"Oh yeah, I put Instagram story. Yeah, I thought it was an amazing vibe."
41:03;41:10;"Also, somebody told me that there's somebody who hosts almost like a sports like play by play color commentary of fish shows."
41:10;41:16;"Like in real time. They're just like, oh, it sounds like Trey is starting to tease Tweezer."
41:16;41:21;"Is he going to bring the riff back? Hold on. Hold on. Fishman is going double time."
41:21;41:24;"Is that does that exist? Somebody told me there's something like that."
41:24;41:28;"I don't think I would listen to that before the show. That sounds so much more entertaining."
41:28;41:31;"Somebody told me there's something like that existed and that's how they knew I was at the show"
41:31;41:33;"because the guys were like, there's a cat in the building."
41:33;41:37;"I don't think that normally exists. That might have been true for that show."
41:37;41:40;"I know that there was like a lot of controversy about that show."
41:40;41:46;"Like a lot of people were sort of mad that they played well and that it was like a radio only show."
41:46;41:51;"Like because that show wasn't on the live fish app. Blacked out."
41:51;41:55;"You could only hear it on the serious app. So like a lot of people were mad about that."
41:55;42:00;"I heard people complaining about the on air hosts like not being that good, which I'm not saying that myself."
42:00;42:04;"I have not heard it yet. I was I was gone that night."
42:04;42:08;"But you know, people are critical of these sorts of things."
42:08;42:13;"And like when things don't proceed as they normally do or as people feel that they're supposed to,"
42:13;42:16;"the fan base gets pretty upset."
42:16;42:24;"So like something even small about like not putting a show on the fish app is a pretty big deal among the jam band community."
42:24;42:27;"That's true with any kind of fan base."
42:27;42:31;"Like, right. I think within any any fan base, you have your quiet fans"
42:31;42:37;"and you have your just like super positive, excited about everything coming down the pipeline,"
42:37;42:39;"understanding when things are different or something."
42:39;42:43;"And then every fan base has just like worse than the haters fans."
42:43;42:47;"Everything is just like, wow, these guys can suck."
42:47;42:51;"Like, yeah, waiting for those moments to be like, well, that's official."
42:51;42:54;"30 plus years in and fish is finally sold out, man."
42:54;42:56;"I'm joining the flock."
42:56;43:02;"The cool shade of the banana tree on the rugged trail toward the balcony."
43:02;43:12;"The child of the 20th century, a dried up Goliath and a weasel."
43:12;43:18;"Far away in another place, a fading beauty named Millie Grace."
43:18;43:28;"A gospel singer with pox on her face and a bamboo cane to help her keep the pace."
43:28;43:34;"V was a Buddhist prodigy long past the age of maturity."
43:34;43:44;"Someday he knew it would set him free like it did for Floyd the chimpanzee."
43:44;43:50;"Whoa, trying to live a life that's completely free."
43:50;43:53;"The race is where the wind, your first wind deck."
43:53;43:57;"So have a cup of coffee and get your breath."
43:57;44:03;"Whoa, V, you're trying to live a life that's completely free."
44:03;44:06;"The race is where the wind, your first wind deck."
44:06;44:09;"So have a cup of coffee and get your breath."
44:09;44:13;"Stephen, do you have a podcast that's coming out soon?"
44:13;44:14;"Yes."
44:14;44:15;"Is it kind of related to this?"
44:15;44:16;"Yes, I do."
44:16;44:19;"And thank you for asking, Jake."
44:19;44:21;"It's coming out next month."
44:21;44:23;"It's called 36 from the Vault."
44:23;44:25;"It's me and my friend Rob Mitchum."
44:25;44:30;"We're going to be reviewing every installment of the Dick's Pick series"
44:30;44:33;"with like digressions along the way."
44:33;44:36;"We'll probably do like official Dead Live albums."
44:36;44:41;"We might do some Dave's Picks, might do some John Mayer live records in there too."
44:41;44:48;"You know, as the whole kid caboodle, I feel like, you know, this is something that if the show takes off,"
44:48;44:52;"we can find a way to do it forever, you know, because there's so many different great Dead Live stuff."
44:52;44:54;"Are you going to be talking over the show?"
44:54;44:59;"No, I mean, it's always tricky with like rights issues."
44:59;45:00;"Oh, I see."
45:00;45:05;"So we probably won't actually be playing any of the actual music in there."
45:05;45:12;"But we have a great score that's being written by Amar, who you've talked about on your show,"
45:12;45:15;"who like does those great jam breakdown videos."
45:15;45:16;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
45:16;45:22;"Well, yeah, I was thinking about him as you're discussing the kind of post show because he contextualizes everything."
45:22;45:24;"Yeah, he's doing the score for the show."
45:24;45:27;"So that's going to be playing under us as we're talking."
45:27;45:31;"One of the fun things about this podcast is that, you know, we're going to be talking about the concerts,"
45:31;45:35;"but we're also going to be talking about the show itself."
45:35;45:37;"So we're going to be talking about the show itself."
45:57;46:00;"- I think he's a big fan of horror, including in the comics realm."
46:00;46:03;"As we were just talking about this auction of all his comics,"
46:03;46:06;"they're definitely leaning a lot of tales from the crypt."
46:06;46:10;"- Right, and there's that bit in the documentary Long Strange Trip,"
46:10;46:15;"where like the last interview he did was about Abbott Costello meets Frankenstein, I think it was."
46:15;46:16;"- Right."
46:16;46:18;"- So he was like a big horror movie fan."
46:18;46:20;"So it's a great excuse to talk about the dead,"
46:20;46:24;"but it's also just like a fun way to talk about like pop culture history,"
46:24;46:26;"like around the time of each show."
46:26;46:28;"And like talking about the music venues that they played in,"
46:28;46:33;"because there's like some weird old theaters and convention centers"
46:33;46:38;"that don't exist anymore that the Grateful Dead played in, like in the '60s and '70s."
46:38;46:39;"- Oh, looking forward to that."
46:39;46:40;"- Sounds fun."
46:40;46:41;"- Yeah, we've banked a couple ups."
46:41;46:42;"- Oh, cool."
46:42;46:44;"- By the way, am I a friend of the podcast now?"
46:44;46:45;"This is my second time on this show."
46:45;46:47;"- Yeah, I think now you're a friend of the pod, for sure."
46:47;46:49;"- Which means I've been demoted, right?"
46:49;46:51;"Because I was executive level before now."
46:51;46:54;"Isn't that how it goes if you're like a first-time guest?"
46:54;46:56;"- There's a type of demotion."
46:56;46:58;"Familiarity breeds contempt."
46:58;47:00;"[laughter]"
47:00;47:07;"So, you know, the closer to the crew, that's the kind of irony of life."
47:07;47:10;"A lot of people hold some of their worst vitriol for their loved ones."
47:10;47:12;"- I'm still honored. I'm still honored to be a friend of the pod."
47:12;47:16;"- Are you taking notes? We need a real friend of the pod."
47:16;47:17;"- That's our next one."
47:17;47:20;"- Okay, tight. Well, what song should we play?"
47:20;47:23;"I'm sure all the TC heads are on the edge of their seat right now."
47:23;47:24;"They want to hear this band."
47:24;47:26;"Butterum is very Jamflow, man."
47:26;47:30;"- Well, it's also sort of like a non-satirical bananas and blow."
47:30;47:31;"- Exactly."
47:31;47:32;"- You know, like the Wayne song."
47:32;47:35;"You know, my feeling on jam bands is that, like,"
47:35;47:40;"I think a good jam band should be, like, 15% cheesy, you know?"
47:40;47:42;"Because, like, a great jam band,"
47:42;47:46;"they're simultaneously an art band and a party band, you know?"
47:46;47:49;"Like, the Dead plays Dark Star for 20 minutes,"
47:49;47:51;"and then they play Good Lovin' right after that, you know?"
47:51;47:54;"Or Fish plays, you know, You Enjoy Myself,"
47:54;47:56;"and then they play Suzie Greenberg after that."
47:56;47:59;"You know, you've got, like, the esoteric stuff"
47:59;48:03;"and, like, sort of like the beer-hoisting, dumb party anthem type stuff."
48:03;48:05;"So, like, with Goose, you know,"
48:05;48:08;"they definitely have, like, you know, the buttered rum part,"
48:08;48:11;"but, you know, they can also go off for 20 minutes into outer space"
48:11;48:14;"and do kind of cool jammy things."
48:14;48:20;"So I will say the show I'd recommend is 10, 18, 19."
48:20;48:22;"So recent."
48:22;48:24;"I think it's a really good show,"
48:24;48:26;"and it's the show that got me into it."
48:26;48:30;"And they do a cover of The Way It Is, the Bruce Hornsby song."
48:30;48:32;"-Oh, the song. -They actually do a really--"
48:32;48:34;"It's, like, a 15-minute version of that song."
48:34;48:37;"I think they do, like-- I think it's a really good version."
48:37;48:39;"I think they do a great cover of that."
48:39;48:42;"They do a cover of Inside Out, the song by Spoon."
48:42;48:44;"One tight thing about jam bands is, like,"
48:44;48:46;"you can get so deep in the conversation"
48:46;48:48;"without ever playing the music."
48:48;48:52;"Like, you know, if you're telling us about, like, a new indie rock band"
48:52;48:55;"or just, like, a new singer-songwriter kind of guy,"
48:55;48:57;"like, the next Iron and Wine or something,"
48:57;48:59;"if you go more than, like, three minutes"
48:59;49:02;"without playing the music, it's, like, insane."
49:02;49:04;"But with jam bands, you could actually be, like,"
49:04;49:07;"they're Goose, they're out of Norwalk, Connecticut,"
49:07;49:10;"10, 18, 19's a great show, and they do a 15-minute"
49:10;49:12;"That's Just The Way It Is by Bruce Hornsby."
49:12;49:14;"And I'm like, ""Tell me more, man."""
49:14;49:16;"Like, ""No, we don't need to listen to it yet."""
49:16;49:19;"15-minute? 15-minute, horns be tight."
49:19;49:20;"[laughs]"
49:20;49:22;"Maybe you should just, like, you know,"
49:22;49:23;"if you don't want to listen to the show,"
49:23;49:26;"just, like, take in my description of it and enjoy that, you know?"
49:26;49:28;"Like, maybe you should just stop there,"
49:28;49:30;"if you like, like, what I'm describing."
49:30;49:32;"I should just go, like, terrorize some jam band message boards"
49:32;49:35;"and be like, ""I'm a text-based jam enthusiast."
49:35;49:37;"I don't listen to the music."""
49:37;49:38;"[laughs]"
49:38;49:39;"Like, ""Yes, we exist."""
49:39;49:41;"Never heard a note, never will."
49:41;49:44;"Okay, wait, Steve, is there one Goose song, though, to play?"
49:44;49:46;"Obviously, we're all going to check out 10, 18, 19."
49:46;49:47;"♪ Butter 'em ♪"
49:47;49:49;"Not--besides ""Butter 'em."""
49:49;49:52;"What's one that's, like, just your favorite?"
49:52;49:54;"Why don't you play ""Time to Flee""?"
49:54;49:55;"Okay, time."
49:55;49:56;"Okay."
49:56;49:58;"All right, everybody, Steve and Hyden,"
49:58;49:59;"thanks again for calling in,"
49:59;50:01;"and here's Goose with ""Time to Flee."""
50:01;50:02;"♪"
50:02;50:06;"Time Crisis with Ezra K. Nagle."
50:06;50:08;"This your roast."
50:08;50:12;"♪"
50:12;50:17;"♪ Ups and downs, all I know."
50:17;50:23;"♪ This elevator rises too slow."
50:23;50:28;"♪ Trapped inside with you."
50:28;50:33;"♪ No way out, déjà vu."
50:33;50:37;"♪"
50:37;50:42;"♪ I don't feel free."
50:42;50:45;"♪ It was time to flee."
50:45;50:48;"♪ The elevator."
50:48;50:50;"♪ I'm not a waiter."
50:50;50:53;"♪ So see you later."
50:53;50:56;"♪ Alligator."
50:56;50:59;"♪ The elevator."
50:59;51:01;"♪ I'm not a waiter."
51:01;51:04;"♪ So see you later."
51:04;51:05;"♪ Alligator."
51:05;51:07;"You know what I just thought of?"
51:07;51:09;"Because on the one hand,"
51:09;51:10;"becoming more and more familiar"
51:10;51:12;"with the jam community every day,"
51:12;51:14;"but I don't know the ins and outs."
51:14;51:16;"I hope there's no, like, twiddle Goose beef."
51:16;51:18;"That's gonna be messed up, 'cause--"
51:18;51:20;"Right, we're just gonna get back to the twiddle camp,"
51:20;51:22;"then we're going to the Goose show at the Troubadour."
51:22;51:23;"Yeah."
51:23;51:24;"Both nights."
51:24;51:25;"But--"
51:25;51:26;"What would be the beef?"
51:26;51:27;"Just sort of, like--"
51:27;51:28;"You know, just sometimes--"
51:28;51:29;"Young competitive bands?"
51:29;51:31;"Look, I remember when Vampire Weekend came out,"
51:31;51:33;"there'd be some other indie bands dropping their album."
51:33;51:35;"You know, they got to get a little--"
51:35;51:37;"Talking a little spicy in the interview, man."
51:37;51:38;"Right."
51:38;51:40;"We live in a competitive society, man."
51:40;51:41;"Dog eat dog."
51:41;51:42;"It's dog eat dog."
51:42;51:44;"There's no social safety net in America, man."
51:44;51:47;"So, you know, people are fighting for that slot."
51:47;51:49;"Another person's success is often perceived"
51:49;51:52;"to be a lack of opportunity for you."
51:52;51:53;"But you know what, man?"
51:53;51:54;"That's what makes great art, Ezra."
51:54;51:56;"It's that cutthroat competitive spirit."
51:56;51:59;"It's that brutal sense of competition and--"
51:59;52:00;"Well, partially."
52:00;52:02;"I mean, all joking aside."
52:02;52:04;"I wonder if the--"
52:04;52:06;"Well, I'm just saying, I guess the jam band community"
52:06;52:07;"is a little more embracing."
52:07;52:08;"Trudle's been around for a while."
52:08;52:09;"And I will say one thing,"
52:09;52:14;"because actually, Mahali texted me a couple months ago,"
52:14;52:15;"or a few weeks--"
52:15;52:16;"I can't even remember anymore."
52:16;52:17;"But Mahali from Trudle hit me up"
52:17;52:22;"because he was letting me know that his buddy's in a jam band."
52:22;52:23;"I'm sure everybody would--"
52:23;52:25;"Just like when people call Vampire Weekend an indie band,"
52:25;52:27;"I'm sure a lot of these bands would be like,"
52:27;52:29;"""Okay, you know, we're jam, but we're also this."""
52:29;52:30;"Yeah."
52:30;52:32;"So he put me on to this band called Aquius,"
52:32;52:36;"and he sent me an 11-minute sunflower that they busted out--"
52:36;52:37;"Wow."
52:37;52:38;"--at Higher Ground in Burlington."
52:38;52:39;"Sick."
52:39;52:40;"It was tight."
52:40;52:41;"I mean, they're incredible musicians."
52:41;52:43;"I was like, ""Oh, I don't know anything about these guys."""
52:43;52:45;"And Mahali was like, ""Yo, they're like an up-and-coming jam band."
52:45;52:46;"I really love them."""
52:46;52:47;"And he's like, ""Yo, check them out."""
52:47;52:48;"He was so--"
52:48;52:51;"I mean, I could already tell that he has a generosity of spirit,"
52:51;52:52;"but he was just all like--"
52:52;52:55;"He was like, ""Oh, yeah, you should totally check these dudes out,"""
52:55;52:57;"which, again, is what you want from the jam community."
52:57;52:58;"Right."
52:58;53:02;"Sometimes this stuff happens beyond the artist relationship."
53:02;53:03;"It can be the press."
53:03;53:05;"It can be the fans."
53:05;53:08;"It can be the people on message boards can pit artists against each other."
53:08;53:11;"They're drumming up that goose twiddle animosity."
53:11;53:14;"Did you see that Aquius does a sunflower cover?"
53:14;53:15;"Seinfeld!"
53:15;53:16;"Wow."
53:16;53:17;"Is that what you just said?"
53:17;53:19;"Get your head out of your ass, buddy."
53:19;53:21;"I was reading about it while you were talking about it."
53:21;53:22;"I apologize."
53:22;53:23;"Is that what you just said?"
53:23;53:26;"We hired you because we believed you could multitask."
53:26;53:27;"I was trying to crunch the numbers."
53:27;53:29;"I'll admit that your job is demanding."
53:29;53:32;"You need to simultaneously listen to Jake and I's every word"
53:32;53:33;"as you're crunching the numbers."
53:33;53:34;"We can cut this part."
53:34;53:35;"No, no, we're not cutting this part."
53:35;53:36;"No, we're not cutting this part."
53:36;53:38;"You know, I feel like we should just cut this part."
53:38;53:40;"The fall of Seinfeld."
53:40;53:41;"This is the real fall of Seinfeld."
53:41;53:43;"How often does that happen?"
53:43;53:45;"Well, anyway, maybe I was just saying it for emphasis."
53:45;53:48;"I heard you, and I just wanted to repeat it again for the fans."
53:48;53:50;"No, I forgive you, although I do want to point out"
53:50;53:55;"that this is the type of thing that if it happened in middle school or something"
53:55;53:57;"it would upend society."
53:57;54:01;"Just to any of our younger fans, this is the type of thing if you're in middle school"
54:01;54:03;"and a bunch of people are joking about something and you're--"
54:03;54:06;"I feel like--I'm pretty sure I was on both sides of this."
54:06;54:10;"Almost every kid is where, you know, just like middle school"
54:10;54:12;"you're so terrified of making a mistake or something."
54:12;54:15;"Actually, I can remember one time I was a little bit like this"
54:15;54:18;"because I know nothing about sports, but I have a long history"
54:18;54:19;"of trying to pretend that I do."
54:19;54:23;"I remember a bunch of kids were talking about who was the best player in the NBA,"
54:23;54:27;"and kids were like, ""Well, obviously, you know, Shaquille O'Neal right now, blah blah blah."""
54:27;54:29;"And then I was just like, ""What about Shaq?"""
54:29;54:32;"[laughter]"
54:32;54:36;"I didn't know, man. I just heard people talking about Shaq--Shaquille."
54:36;54:38;"It's kind of pronounced differently."
54:38;54:41;"Shaquille is ""shuh-kuh."""
54:41;54:44;"Not Shaq. It's not Shaquille."
54:44;54:46;"Or maybe it is. But anyway."
54:46;54:50;"I think the takeaway is that I was just so focused on, you know,"
54:50;54:53;"crunching those numbers that I--"
54:53;54:55;"Hey, we can cut this part."
54:55;54:57;"Let's talk about the Grammys."
54:57;55:00;"Okay, Ezra, congratulations on your Grammy nominations."
55:00;55:01;"Oh, thank you."
55:01;55:02;"Burying the lead."
55:02;55:03;"We buried the lead."
55:03;55:04;"Congrats."
55:04;55:07;"I feel bad now. I feel like I should have brought this up earlier."
55:07;55:11;"Yeah, I was just kind of waiting."
55:11;55:12;"Well, I guess to be fair--"
55:12;55:13;"My bad."
55:13;55:15;"Jake, did we ever get you registered to vote for the Grammys?"
55:15;55:17;"Yet another year goes by."
55:17;55:23;"We're probably going to lose everything by one vote."
55:23;55:27;"This was a big year for us because we got nominated in three categories."
55:27;55:30;"Best Alternative Album, that's the one that Modern Vampires won."
55:30;55:31;"That's happened already."
55:31;55:32;"Old hat."
55:32;55:35;"I mean, you know, it's still exciting, but we've experienced that."
55:35;55:37;"The other two are a little more interesting."
55:37;55:41;"One is Album of the Year because that means finally we're going to be on TV."
55:41;55:43;"Who else got nominated in that?"
55:43;55:44;"Number Crunch Seinfeld."
55:44;55:49;"Bonnie Vare, Lana Del Rey, Billie Eilish, H.E.R., her?"
55:49;55:50;"Is that--"
55:50;55:51;"Yes."
55:51;55:55;"Ariana Grande, Lil Nas X, Lizzo, and Vampire Weekend."
55:55;55:57;"It's a pretty wild group."
55:57;55:58;"And that's like eight nominees?"
55:58;55:59;"Tough odds."
55:59;56:00;"It's tough odds."
56:00;56:01;"I was thinking it would be five."
56:01;56:06;"In fact, my buddy I saw in New York told me that he put some money on us winning."
56:06;56:07;"Tight."
56:07;56:09;"And I said, ""Well, what are the biggest odds?"""
56:09;56:11;"And he's-- like, no joke, he's 62 to 1."
56:11;56:12;"And I was like, ""Okay."""
56:12;56:13;"Who's favored?"
56:13;56:14;"I didn't ask him."
56:14;56:19;"I would guess Lana Del Rey, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lizzo."
56:19;56:22;"Those are maybe the more-- we're definitely in the bottom half."
56:22;56:25;"I feel like the dark horses would be us, Lil Nas X,"
56:25;56:28;"which kind of rules because he's nominated for an EP."
56:28;56:29;"It's 18 minutes long."
56:29;56:30;"Oh, wow."
56:30;56:32;"That would be cool if that won just to--"
56:32;56:33;"EP."
56:33;56:34;"Just to upend society."
56:34;56:38;"But I think the fact that it's so stacked sometimes means that it's anybody's--"
56:38;56:39;"anything could happen."
56:39;56:40;"Yeah."
56:40;56:43;"Low-key, I was doing an interview last week."
56:43;56:47;"We played this-- a radio festival for 92.3 in New York."
56:47;56:50;"The guy asked me, like, ""All right, man, you've nominated for some Grammys."
56:50;56:51;"Let's say you win Album of the Year."
56:51;56:54;"What's the first thoughts going through your head as you're walking your way to the podium?"""
56:54;56:58;"And truly the first thing I thought of was other people's fans being angry."
56:58;57:03;"Just like Lana Del Rey fans being like, ""Who the [bleep] are these losers?"""
57:03;57:06;"Billie Eilish fans being like, ""What is this old bull [bleep]?"""
57:06;57:09;"And me being there like, ""I don't know what to say to you guys."""
57:09;57:11;"It's like I don't even want to talk about that one."
57:11;57:12;"Album of the Year is just kind of stressful."
57:12;57:14;"So what's the third nomination?"
57:14;57:16;"This is the one I want to talk about."
57:16;57:20;"Third nomination, Harmony Hall, Best Rock Song."
57:20;57:22;"Oh, wow, that is interesting."
57:22;57:25;"Seinfeld, what are the nominees in Best Rock Song?"
57:25;57:29;"And one thing, Best Rock Song, there's different categories where you could be nominated."
57:29;57:34;"Like the recording gets nominated and then the producer is not-- the art, the band is."
57:34;57:36;"This is just as a songwriter."
57:36;57:37;"So I'm nominated."
57:37;57:38;"Just the publishing."
57:38;57:39;"Right."
57:39;57:41;"Not the recording or the performance."
57:41;57:42;"This is not a Vampire Weekend nomination."
57:42;57:44;"This is me as a songwriter."
57:44;57:52;"You're up against Tool, The 1975, Brittany Howard, and Gary Clark Jr."
57:52;57:53;"Dude, you're going to clean up."
57:53;57:54;"I don't know what our odds are."
57:54;57:57;"Probably a little better than Album of the Year, but this is what I wanted to talk about."
57:57;57:59;"Is this award on TV?"
57:59;58:00;"I don't think so."
58:00;58:03;"I think only Album of the Year, which is the final award."
58:03;58:05;"Yeah, truly Album of the Year."
58:05;58:08;"I truly think it is an honor just to be nominated."
58:08;58:09;"Yeah, it's amazing."
58:09;58:10;"I can't even--"
58:10;58:12;"The other ones are a little more interesting to me."
58:12;58:14;"The thing I wanted to bring up because I want to get Jake's take on this."
58:14;58:17;"I'm going to bet, by the way, on Album of the Year."
58:17;58:19;"You're going to take the 62 to 1 odds?"
58:19;58:22;"Yeah, it's going to be like when Arcade Fire won."
58:22;58:23;"Didn't they win Album of the Year?"
58:23;58:24;"Yeah."
58:24;58:25;"All right, that's what's going to happen."
58:25;58:26;"We're back."
58:26;58:28;"Want to put down $100?"
58:28;58:32;"I wouldn't want to win Album of the Year, somebody run on stage, say I didn't deserve it."
58:32;58:33;"See, that's the thing."
58:33;58:37;"I felt like when Kanye ran on stage when Beck won, Beck had this look on his face."
58:37;58:40;"And he's a laid back, mellow dude, kind of vibe guy."
58:40;58:44;"And he was almost like-- the look on his face was almost like, yeah, yeah, man."
58:44;58:45;"I don't know."
58:45;58:47;"Maybe I shouldn't be up here."
58:47;58:50;"So Justin Vernon's going to get up there and be like, what the hell is this?"
58:50;58:51;"Friend of the show."
58:51;58:53;"Friend of the show."
58:53;58:56;"Something changed, became an enemy of the show."
58:56;58:58;"Father of the bride winning, get out of here."
58:58;59:00;"This clearly is Lizzo's trophy."
59:00;59:01;"He takes it out of your hands."
59:01;59:02;"Yeah."
59:02;59:03;"OK."
59:03;59:04;"So anyway, Rock Song of the Year."
59:04;59:07;"But that's the one that I wanted to talk about on the show because that's the one that I"
59:07;59:11;"was kind of the most psyched about because it's a songwriting award."
59:11;59:14;"And songwriting is very important to me."
59:14;59:18;"It's a pretty random mix in there, but rock is pretty random in 2019."
59:18;59:19;"But here's the thing."
59:19;59:23;"On Instagram, there's a Vampire Weekend post about the nominations."
59:23;59:25;"And I'm looking at some of the comments."
59:25;59:28;"We had a lot of fans very proud of us."
59:28;59:31;"And it was tight, very heartwarming to see that they felt like they were a part of it,"
59:31;59:33;"which they should feel."
59:33;59:38;"And then you had a few people, not exactly haters, but fans being like, ""Best rock song,"
59:38;59:40;"you know, eye roll kind of vibe."""
59:40;59:44;"And so I see a few of these, I'm just like, ""What the f*ck is that supposed to mean?"""
59:44;59:50;"And then I had a brief exchange with one dude who said, ""Basically, like, this is not a rock song."""
59:50;59:53;"And I was kind of like, ""Look, there's a lot of Vampire Weekend songs I wouldn't call rock songs."""
59:53;59:56;"But I was like, ""It's got a f*cking guitar solo."""
59:56;01:00:01;"So this dude, I said, ""Are you familiar with the tasteful palate of 1970s rock?"""
01:00:01;01:00:04;"And then it became this whole thing where, like, I felt bad."
01:00:04;01:00:06;"Was it a pile-on?"
01:00:06;01:00:09;"I don't even know how old this person is or what their take is."
01:00:09;01:00:12;"But, okay, this is my gut feeling based on--"
01:00:12;01:00:15;"And, like, there are totally people who are like, ""Yeah, obviously it's a rock song."""
01:00:15;01:00:20;"But this is my gut feeling is that the definition of rock, maybe to the younger generations,"
01:00:20;01:00:25;"has narrowed to an even, like, smaller place than back in the day."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"Sure."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"Like, maybe to some younger people, rock is just, like--"
01:00:28;01:00:29;"Heavy."
01:00:29;01:00:31;"Yeah, it's kind of, like, heavy."
01:00:31;01:00:32;"Like, tool."
01:00:32;01:00:37;"Like, yeah, on one side of the spectrum, maybe it's like Jet or Greta Van Fleet, just like--"
01:00:37;01:00:38;"[imitates guitar riff]"
01:00:38;01:00:39;"Yeah."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"And then on the other side, it's just, like, true, like--"
01:00:40;01:00:41;"[imitates guitar riff]"
01:00:41;01:00:45;"Because I'm kind of like acoustic guitar riff and, you know, pentatonic riff and harmony."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"I mean, that's rock, man."
01:00:46;01:00:49;"And that kind of, like, stonesy kind of piano groove."
01:00:49;01:00:54;"I think the idea of even being like, ""That's rock piano,"" maybe doesn't compute for some people."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"And I was also kind of like, ""Well, what else is it?"""
01:00:56;01:00:58;"Adult contemporary."
01:00:58;01:00:59;"But even adult--"
01:00:59;01:01:00;"Yeah, no, I'm kidding."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"I mean, it's--"
01:01:01;01:01:02;"Yeah, so I was just kind of like--"
01:01:02;01:01:07;"If you're, like, a 15-year-old kid and you've listened to, like, Nirvana and Tool and The Strokes,"
01:01:07;01:01:14;"there's not a lot of bands that are, like, doing kind of, like, a kinks, stonesy, deady,"
01:01:14;01:01:17;"little more low-key, melodic kind of thing."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"Yeah, I know."
01:01:18;01:01:22;"Like, maybe you've heard The Shins and that sort of, like--"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"What is this oldies act kind of thing?"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"Maybe they consider it pop."
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Maybe, but we're so clearly not pop."
01:01:28;01:01:29;"Well, and I guess--"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"To someone that loves Tool."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"Right."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"Although, arguably, like, that Tool--"
01:01:33;01:01:34;"Can you throw that Tool song?"
01:01:34;01:01:36;"I'm kind of curious what the Tool--"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"No, because the Tool is not, like, straight-ahead rock either."
01:01:38;01:01:39;"Tool is, like, prog--"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"It's mathy, but it's real heavy."
01:01:41;01:01:42;"And that song has, like, hand drums and stuff."
01:01:42;01:01:43;"Does it?"
01:01:43;01:01:44;"Yeah, wait."
01:01:44;01:01:47;"I kind of want to hear the Tool song that you're going to be competing with."
01:01:47;01:01:51;"Ezra, toe-to-toe against Maynard."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"That would be a funny one to win."
01:01:53;01:01:56;"If there was one that we were going to win, I think it should be best rock song,"
01:01:56;01:02:00;"partially because that would be the most fun one to make a speech for."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"Yeah, dude."
01:02:01;01:02:04;"Ladies and gentlemen, rock music."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"Alive and well, not played out, dog."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"Not played out, dog."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"I want to tell you a story."
01:02:09;01:02:12;"My buddy Jake once was working with a gentleman."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"[laughs]"
01:02:13;01:02:16;"They were on lunch break eating Chipotle."
01:02:16;01:02:21;"This guy took a big bite of his burrito and said, ""Rock's played out, dog."""
01:02:21;01:02:22;"I'm here to tell you it's not."
01:02:22;01:02:24;"And although we have won the award today,"
01:02:24;01:02:27;"I consider this a win for all of us in the rock community."
01:02:27;01:02:30;"Maynard Ferguson, I'm looking at you."
01:02:30;01:02:32;"A hats off to you, sir."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"Hats off to you."
01:02:34;01:02:36;"Brittany Howard."
01:02:36;01:02:37;"[laughs]"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"I raise a glass to you, ma'am."
01:02:39;01:02:41;"[laughs]"
01:02:41;01:02:43;"Gary Clark, Jr., absolute shredder."
01:02:43;01:02:46;"The 1975, they're from across the pond."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"[laughs]"
01:02:47;01:02:48;"Very cool."
01:02:48;01:02:50;"I like your kind of David Bowie thing you're doing."
01:02:50;01:02:51;"Very cool."
01:02:52;01:02:53;"England has--"
01:02:53;01:02:54;"[laughs]"
01:02:54;01:02:55;"Very cool."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"England has contributed so much to rock history."
01:02:57;01:02:59;"I'm getting into, like, a very specific--"
01:02:59;01:03:00;"Story of history of rock."
01:03:00;01:03:03;"I'm doing, like--this is, like, one of the guys from SNL does this voice."
01:03:03;01:03:04;"[imitates sound]"
01:03:04;01:03:05;"Wait, who is--I love that guy."
01:03:05;01:03:06;"Beck Bennett."
01:03:06;01:03:07;"Oh, Beck Bennett."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"This is a Beck Bennett character."
01:03:09;01:03:12;"Maybe we should ask Beck Bennett to go on and accept."
01:03:12;01:03:16;"From the Rolling Stones to David Bowie to even the Cure and Oasis,"
01:03:16;01:03:20;"England has produced many of the greatest rock bands of our time."
01:03:20;01:03:22;"You continue to fly that flag high."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"That Union Jack."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"He's becoming, like, Kyle Mooney a little bit."
01:03:26;01:03:28;"And now he's becoming Kyle Mooney."
01:03:28;01:03:31;"This is the Tool song--wait, is the Tool song ""Fear Inoculum,"""
01:03:31;01:03:33;"the title track from the album ""Fear Inoculum""?"
01:03:33;01:03:34;"Yes, it is."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"Yeah."
01:03:35;01:03:39;"So this song is 10 minutes, 20 seconds, so--"
01:03:39;01:03:40;"Wow."
01:03:40;01:03:43;"It's happening."
01:03:43;01:03:48;"That's very, like, early mid-'70s, like a 10-minute rock song."
01:03:48;01:03:49;"Yeah."
01:03:49;01:03:53;"He nominated."
01:03:53;01:03:58;"So these kids, they accept this is rock, but Harmony Hall is not?"
01:03:58;01:04:03;"Nights in white satin."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"Made it first, then."
01:04:05;01:04:08;"You, sir, are a freaking legend."
01:04:08;01:04:14;"Love your stuff, bro."
01:04:14;01:04:19;"Also, it's really funny, too, that a lot of those awards,"
01:04:19;01:04:22;"the pre-televised awards, it's never like everybody's there."
01:04:22;01:04:26;"It always has this, like, kind of sad, half-full vibe,"
01:04:26;01:04:30;"which is why when we won last album Best Alternative, I was just like, ""Thanks."""
01:04:30;01:04:34;"Because it's so--it's like to give a heartfelt speech in front of just,"
01:04:34;01:04:37;"like, a half-full--hey, listen to this."
01:04:41;01:04:46;"But I'm just picturing, like, Vampire Weekend's the only people there,"
01:04:46;01:04:49;"and then I just write this, like, real heartfelt note to each of the other nominees"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"who just aren't in attendance."
01:04:51;01:04:55;"Maynard Ferguson and the rest of your bandmates in Tool,"
01:04:55;01:05:00;"you've shown that rock is far from restricted to a 4/4 time signature"
01:05:00;01:05:04;"or a 3 1/2-minute pop song structure."
01:05:04;01:05:08;"Over a nearly 30-year career, you've consistently pushed the boundaries"
01:05:08;01:05:11;"of what's possible."
01:05:11;01:05:18;"The 1975, your words to Imagine Dragons were harsh but fair."
01:05:18;01:05:20;"Perhaps I judge--"
01:05:25;01:05:30;"Mr. Healy, perhaps I judge you unfairly."
01:05:30;01:05:35;"When I took you to task for your cruel words about Dan Reynolds and Imagine Dragons,"
01:05:35;01:05:37;"now I understand what you were doing."
01:05:37;01:05:40;"You were trying to push him to be better, just like we're all trying to be better"
01:05:40;01:05:41;"in the genre of rock."
01:05:41;01:05:45;"[laughter]"
01:05:45;01:05:48;"Would you cap it off with one for yourself?"
01:05:48;01:05:53;"And last but not least, myself and the rest of Vampire Weekend."
01:05:53;01:05:56;"That'd be like that Matthew McConaughey, just like,"
01:05:56;01:06:01;"""If I can step outside myself for a second, I'm so f---ing proud of you."""
01:06:01;01:06:06;"You're still rocking, 11 years since the release of your debut album."
01:06:06;01:06:10;"Yeah, it's like the really sweet high school football player that's a little dim."
01:06:10;01:06:12;"[laughter]"
01:06:12;01:06:15;"Just like, just a sweetheart of a guy."
01:06:18;01:06:20;"I'm not a fan of this music."
01:06:20;01:06:22;"[laughter]"
01:06:22;01:06:24;"I kind of am. I'm kind of into it."
01:06:24;01:06:26;"All I'm saying is--"
01:06:26;01:06:29;"How is that up for songwriting?"
01:06:29;01:06:31;"That is-- I'm sorry."
01:06:31;01:06:34;"Like, Tool's written some catchy stuff, but what--"
01:06:34;01:06:35;"Well, skip ahead."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"That is just like-- that's not--"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"Let's just see where does this go."
01:06:41;01:06:43;"All right, time's-- okay, I'm kind of into this."
01:06:45;01:06:47;"This is cool, kind of dusty."
01:06:52;01:06:54;"This sucks. I mean, come on."
01:06:54;01:06:57;"Like, for songwriting?"
01:06:59;01:07:01;"Okay, it's still sound."
01:07:01;01:07:06;"This is like a very deep cut on like melancholy, calling infinite sadness or something."
01:07:06;01:07:08;"I can't be mad at that. I like it."
01:07:08;01:07:13;"I'm not mad that it exists. I'm mad that it was nominated for best rock songwriting."
01:07:13;01:07:16;"There's also rock performance."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"Give it to that, man."
01:07:17;01:07:20;"Have you seen Tool's like onstage get-ups? Like how they--"
01:07:20;01:07:21;"Wait, is that a Starbucks logo?"
01:07:21;01:07:24;"It's like a subversive. It says like, ""I want--"""
01:07:24;01:07:28;"What does it say? ""I love something in coffee."" It's covered by his arm, but he's wearing like some sort of swat."
01:07:28;01:07:32;"It's like the swat team meets Darth Vader meets Starbucks."
01:07:32;01:07:34;"Kind of Marilyn Manson vibe."
01:07:34;01:07:35;"Yeah."
01:07:35;01:07:36;"Tool's always a little too dark for me."
01:07:36;01:07:39;"Yeah, I'd always like hear a Tool song and be like, ""Okay, tight."""
01:07:39;01:07:42;"But yeah, I could never go--"
01:07:42;01:07:46;"I remember there were just like dudes in my dorm in college who were like really into Tool."
01:07:46;01:07:50;"Like, dudes would just be like playing like an unplugged bass."
01:07:50;01:07:51;"Just playing Tool riffs?"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"Yeah, just like Metallica and Tool riffs."
01:07:53;01:07:54;"On a six-string bass?"
01:07:54;01:07:57;"Like two in the afternoon on like an unplugged bass."
01:07:57;01:08:00;"Well, Tool has produced some very iconic riffs."
01:08:00;01:08:03;"(mimics guitar riff)"
01:08:03;01:08:04;"For sure."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"Maynard Ferguson."
01:08:05;01:08:07;"Wait, wait, wait. What's his name?"
01:08:07;01:08:08;"Maynard James Keenan."
01:08:08;01:08:12;"Oh my God. I wasn't even kidding. Wait, who's Maynard Ferguson?"
01:08:12;01:08:13;"Is that like a jazz musician?"
01:08:13;01:08:14;"Let's see."
01:08:14;01:08:15;"Oh my God."
01:08:15;01:08:18;"No, I'm actually embarrassed because I like Tool. Yeah, Maynard James Keenan."
01:08:18;01:08:22;"He's a Birdland jazz musician. He's a Canadian jazz trumpeter."
01:08:22;01:08:23;"Oh, really?"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"Yeah. Also worthy of respect."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"That'd be even weirder. Just get up there."
01:08:27;01:08:30;"I'm so impressed by all the nominees tonight."
01:08:30;01:08:33;"Maynard Ferguson, Canadian jazz trumpeter."
01:08:33;01:08:34;"(laughs)"
01:08:34;01:08:35;"Rest in peace."
01:08:35;01:08:37;"Rest in peace."
01:08:37;01:08:39;"Maynard James Keenan."
01:08:39;01:08:41;"(laughs)"
01:08:41;01:08:44;"Well, dude, I hope you win for best rock song."
01:08:44;01:08:47;"God, and you can't even vote for us? Damn."
01:08:47;01:08:49;"Honestly, at least I know that I--"
01:08:49;01:08:52;"Just knowing that I would have had your vote if you were registered to vote,"
01:08:52;01:08:53;"that's very meaningful to me, Jake."
01:08:53;01:08:54;"Hell yeah, dude."
01:08:54;01:08:56;"You know what? We might come up goose eggs."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"We might go up for three."
01:08:57;01:08:59;"We might go up for three. I'm prepared for it."
01:08:59;01:09:01;"Well, the TC community's there for you, bud."
01:09:01;01:09:03;"All right. Thanks to the TC heads."
01:09:03;01:09:06;"I'd like to think that anybody who's a TC head,"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"whether they think we deserve to win or not,"
01:09:08;01:09:12;"would at least admit we deserve to be in the category of rock."
01:09:12;01:09:13;"It's a freaking rock song."
01:09:13;01:09:17;"Undoubtedly. If you're confused by that, you don't know your rock, folks."
01:09:17;01:09:19;"Yeah, you don't know your rock."
01:09:19;01:09:20;"Learn about your rock."
01:09:20;01:09:22;"I would also just say in 2019,"
01:09:22;01:09:26;"if given the chance between expanding the definition of rock"
01:09:26;01:09:29;"to include the tasteful palette of 1970s rock,"
01:09:29;01:09:31;"instruments like piano, things like that,"
01:09:31;01:09:33;"or contracting the definition of rock"
01:09:33;01:09:37;"to essentially just be Greta Van Fleet and Jet,"
01:09:37;01:09:38;"we got to go big, people."
01:09:38;01:09:39;"Who's Jet?"
01:09:39;01:09:41;"I thought Jet was like an '80s band."
01:09:41;01:09:43;"No, they were like early 2000s."
01:09:43;01:09:45;"They were kind of throwback rock, like,"
01:09:45;01:09:47;"""Are you gonna be my girl?"""
01:09:47;01:09:50;"Oh, I hate that. Jet sucks."
01:09:50;01:09:52;"Yeah, I don't think they suck."
01:09:52;01:09:53;"I've always wondered what that was,"
01:09:53;01:09:56;"because you hear that in bad sports bars,"
01:09:56;01:09:57;"and you're just like, ""What is this?"""
01:09:57;01:09:58;"Wait, hold on."
01:09:58;01:09:59;"It's Jet."
01:09:59;01:10:01;"You might have felt that way back in the day."
01:10:01;01:10:04;"Now that the dust has settled, let's revisit Jet."
01:10:04;01:10:08;"They infamously got this incredibly cruel, petty pitchfork review"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"where they didn't even write about it."
01:10:10;01:10:13;"They just put a video of a monkey [bleep] in its mouth"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"and gave a 0.0."
01:10:14;01:10:16;"Oh, you gotta write about it."
01:10:16;01:10:17;"You can't just do that."
01:10:17;01:10:18;"What year was that?"
01:10:18;01:10:19;"Although, in a way--"
01:10:19;01:10:20;"2006."
01:10:20;01:10:21;"Okay."
01:10:21;01:10:23;"As somebody who's been reviewed many times over the years,"
01:10:23;01:10:30;"I do actually respect the ""Fuck this shit, sucks"" line of criticism"
01:10:30;01:10:34;"a little more than the half-baked essay"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"where people try to make a grandiose statement"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"about the meaning of the music, which always--"
01:10:38;01:10:39;"Yeah."
01:10:39;01:10:42;"Because actually, I do respect the right of people to just be like,"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"""This shit sucks."
01:10:44;01:10:45;"""I don't like the voice."
01:10:45;01:10:46;"""The voice singer sucks."
01:10:46;01:10:47;"""The vibe sucks."
01:10:47;01:10:48;"""Corny."
01:10:48;01:10:49;"I hate it."""
01:10:49;01:10:50;"So in some ways, it's mean."
01:10:50;01:10:54;"Also, Jet, I imagine, doesn't care about Pitchfork."
01:10:54;01:10:57;"No, there's actually an article in Slate with the dude from Jet"
01:10:57;01:11:01;"talking about how that review had a significant impact on their career."
01:11:01;01:11:02;"What?"
01:11:02;01:11:03;"I remember reading this."
01:11:03;01:11:04;"Wow."
01:11:04;01:11:06;"This is from actually just last year."
01:11:06;01:11:11;"I wanted to ask him about Pitchfork's 0.0 review of Shine On."
01:11:11;01:11:12;"I'm not going to be able to distill it down,"
01:11:12;01:11:15;"but it seems like it was a traumatic thing for this band."
01:11:15;01:11:16;"Wow."
01:11:16;01:11:18;"I mean, okay, I'm sure it did hurt his feelings."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"Oh, I'm sure of that, but--"
01:11:20;01:11:21;"I would say luckily--"
01:11:21;01:11:22;"Well, in the early days of Vampire Weekend,"
01:11:22;01:11:26;"we got some real hyper-personal takedowns and stuff."
01:11:26;01:11:27;"You guys got super harshed on."
01:11:27;01:11:29;"I remember when you guys--"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"when this record was coming out, it was like, ""Jesus Christ."""
01:11:31;01:11:33;"But it was often more--"
01:11:33;01:11:36;"it got it worse in think pieces than maybe reviews."
01:11:36;01:11:37;"Right."
01:11:37;01:11:38;"I mean, of course we've had bad--"
01:11:38;01:11:42;"literally every album has had at least one or two bad reviews."
01:11:42;01:11:44;"It's never been a full wave."
01:11:44;01:11:45;"Actually, it was funny."
01:11:45;01:11:46;"I was kind of looking back through it,"
01:11:46;01:11:51;"and there's kind of one dipshit on Contra."
01:11:51;01:11:52;"Wrote this thing."
01:11:52;01:11:53;"It was like, ""You know, there's some moments,"
01:11:53;01:11:56;"""but it's painfully obvious these guys have nothing to say."""
01:11:56;01:11:59;"And I was just kind of like, ""Man, you didn't give this shit a chance."""
01:11:59;01:12:00;"But whatever."
01:12:00;01:12:01;"People say worse shit."
01:12:01;01:12:02;"And then I remember--"
01:12:02;01:12:03;"Dude, the first song was about horchata."
01:12:03;01:12:04;"Dude."
01:12:04;01:12:05;"Of course we have things to say."
01:12:05;01:12:08;"Dude, we're pushing in a new direction."
01:12:08;01:12:11;"But even on the third album, there was one harsh review."
01:12:11;01:12:12;"There was some incredibly glum reviews,"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"and there was one harsh review that was just like,"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"""Yo, I like the first two albums."
01:12:16;01:12:17;"""This [bleep] sucks."
01:12:17;01:12:19;"""Jesus Christ, this is boring."""
01:12:19;01:12:20;"Wow."
01:12:20;01:12:21;"So whatever."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"Of course you're only going to get one or two,"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"but I would say, though--"
01:12:24;01:12:27;"and obviously I can't speak to the gentleman from Jet."
01:12:27;01:12:29;"Obviously it's easy for me sitting back here to be like,"
01:12:29;01:12:32;"""You know, 0.0, the monkey [bleep] thing in your mouth."""
01:12:32;01:12:33;"Kind of respect it."
01:12:34;01:12:36;"But the truth is, at least--"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"that's just like some old-school bully shit."
01:12:38;01:12:39;"Yeah."
01:12:39;01:12:40;"Just kind of like, ""[bleep] you."
01:12:40;01:12:42;"""We're not down with you, loser."""
01:12:42;01:12:44;"And that is the type of shit that hurts."
01:12:44;01:12:47;"But even the person who gets bullied in that way,"
01:12:47;01:12:50;"I don't think they understand the world of pain."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"Like imagine they go home, and they're just like,"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"""The guy said I couldn't sit with them at the table."""
01:12:54;01:12:57;"And then your parents are like, ""You go sit down with them,"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"""and you say, 'You know what, guys?"
01:12:59;01:13:00;"""'You've been real jerks to me."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"""'I'm going to stand up for myself right now."
01:13:02;01:13:03;"""'Let's talk about this."
01:13:03;01:13:05;"""'I'm going to use my words right now."
01:13:05;01:13:07;"""'I'm not going to just be bullied away from the table."
01:13:07;01:13:09;"""'What's your problem with me?'"""
01:13:09;01:13:11;"And then the guys are like, ""All right, dude, sit down."
01:13:11;01:13:12;"""Let's get into it."""
01:13:12;01:13:14;"And they're just like, ""Here's the thing, man."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"""It's not that we just have like a weird aversion to you."
01:13:17;01:13:18;"""You're not just a loser."
01:13:18;01:13:20;"""You're also like a [bleep] person."
01:13:20;01:13:22;"""You know, you're not just like a humble--"""
01:13:22;01:13:25;"I'm just saying like there's face worse than exclusion."
01:13:25;01:13:27;"And I actually have read reviews."
01:13:27;01:13:29;"I don't think I've ever read a vampire one that's this harsh,"
01:13:29;01:13:32;"but I've read reviews of random [bleep]"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"where even when I don't like the band or the artist,"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"I am just kind of like, ""Oh, my God."""
01:13:36;01:13:39;"I remember Greta Van Fleet got super harsh--"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"I think like a year ago, two years ago."
01:13:41;01:13:42;"Oh, yeah, that was just like--"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"Like a 1.9 or something."
01:13:44;01:13:46;"Just gleefully dunking on them and like--"
01:13:46;01:13:49;"Yeah, and they're like, you know, 19-year-old kids."
01:13:49;01:13:50;"Right."
01:13:50;01:13:51;"From like Michigan or something."
01:13:51;01:13:53;"There's definitely a thing, and, you know,"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"I've said this on this show about my respect for critics,"
01:13:55;01:13:58;"and I think at its best, we all are doing the same thing,"
01:13:58;01:13:59;"musicians and critics."
01:13:59;01:14:01;"We're trying to like make commentary"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"about culture and music and stuff."
01:14:03;01:14:05;"I swear, I'm not just trying to be like--"
01:14:05;01:14:07;"try to sound like neutral on this."
01:14:07;01:14:10;"I really have had critiques from critics"
01:14:10;01:14:13;"who liked one thing, didn't like another thing, whatever,"
01:14:13;01:14:14;"or even just didn't like us,"
01:14:14;01:14:17;"where I actually did think about what they were saying"
01:14:17;01:14:18;"and kind of like--"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"You know, you don't have to agree with somebody,"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"at least in music criticism,"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"to kind of put yourself in their shoes"
01:14:24;01:14:27;"and see their point and still like take something away from it."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"Like 100%, I do see a value--"
01:14:29;01:14:31;"Like, you can't expect everybody to like your s--t,"
01:14:31;01:14:32;"and they're truly--"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"If you can tamp down on your ego,"
01:14:34;01:14:37;"you can learn something from negative stuff."
01:14:37;01:14:38;"Sure."
01:14:38;01:14:40;"But there is this like line that's crossed,"
01:14:40;01:14:41;"and I feel like sometimes people don't--"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"There is a type of person, they just don't understand"
01:14:43;01:14:46;"that like somebody's probably gonna read this s--t"
01:14:46;01:14:49;"that you wrote, and it's like you always have a choice"
01:14:49;01:14:52;"between like criticizing something"
01:14:52;01:14:55;"and like putting together something so like cruel"
01:14:55;01:14:58;"that it has the potential to like haunt somebody."
01:14:58;01:14:59;"Haunt."
01:14:59;01:15:01;"I've seen s--t that people have written about other people"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"where I'm just like, ""Yo, you didn't just say it sucked."
01:15:03;01:15:06;"You like took a hatchet to somebody's like existence."""
01:15:06;01:15:08;"The core of their being."
01:15:08;01:15:10;"I'm not gonna name names 'cause I have great respect"
01:15:10;01:15:12;"for many music writers,"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"such as the legendary Stephen Hyden."
01:15:14;01:15:17;"And there's people I really respect"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"who don't always ride for a vampire."
01:15:19;01:15:21;"Even Anthony Fantano."
01:15:21;01:15:23;"Apparently he didn't like the last album,"
01:15:23;01:15:25;"but I always had this impression of this guy"
01:15:25;01:15:27;"like when I've watched his reviews here and there,"
01:15:27;01:15:28;"he's one dude saying his opinions."
01:15:28;01:15:29;"Yeah."
01:15:29;01:15:31;"You kind of just gotta be like, ""All right."""
01:15:31;01:15:32;"You know, like it is what it is."
01:15:32;01:15:33;"And I truly believe--"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"I've always gotten a vibe off of him"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"in my whatever little things that he's--"
01:15:37;01:15:39;"he's a straight shooter."
01:15:39;01:15:42;"I can accept, you know, somebody like that is like,"
01:15:42;01:15:43;"""This album sucks."""
01:15:43;01:15:45;"It's like, ""All right, man, maybe like the next one."""
01:15:45;01:15:47;"You can't--like, it's all right."
01:15:47;01:15:48;"But yeah, I have seen--"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"there's some people who I've seen them just write"

01:15:51;01:15:55;"""I'm taking this artist down as a person"" criticism."
01:15:55;01:15:58;"And then I see them talk about their life as a critic"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"in very sentimental terms."
01:16:00;01:16:03;"That's like a funny thing where just like the same person"

01:35:24;01:35:27;"""are gonna make the right song that's kind of, like,"

01:35:30;01:35:32;"The fans are all in. They get it."
01:35:32;01:35:34;"But you still need that one song"
01:35:34;01:35:38;"that's the thesis statement for other people to get."
01:35:38;01:35:40;"I think Billie Eilish was, like, a little bit hard"
01:35:40;01:35:42;"for, like, the industry at large to fully wrap their head around,"
01:35:42;01:35:44;"'cause they're like, ""Wait, is she badass,"
01:35:44;01:35:47;"""or is she kind of, like, a gentle ballad-type person?"""
01:35:47;01:35:49;"And then she drops, essentially, a new-school Eminem song."
01:35:49;01:35:51;"- New-school Eminem? - Yeah, listen."

01:36:00;01:36:02;"fun Eminem single, circus music."
01:36:02;01:36:04;"- Okay."

01:36:06;01:36:08;"♪ Then it's Eminem, then it's Eminem, then it's Eminem ♪"
01:36:08;01:36:10;"You know? Like... - Yeah, yeah."
01:36:10;01:36:13;"- And also, the fact that the song is called ""Bad Guy,"""
01:36:13;01:36:15;"it's like a character introduction."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"It's a thesis statement. I don't--"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"I don't know if there's probably a better word for it,"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"but she basically is like, ""I'm the bad guy."""
01:36:21;01:36:23;"It's like a song like ""Desperado"" or something."
01:36:23;01:36:26;"It's like, this is the character of this music."
01:36:26;01:36:29;"I'm this whispery person, but I also do bad [bleep]"
01:36:29;01:36:31;"and I'm not scared of you. - It's very chill."
01:36:31;01:36:33;"- That's what's amazing about her music is that"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"it's most-- - She's so quiet."
01:36:35;01:36:37;"- But this is, like, one of the more hype songs."
01:36:37;01:36:39;"- What? Really? - Yeah."

01:36:57;01:36:59;"- A little bit of butt head in there."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"- Yep. - That '90s love."
01:37:01;01:37:04;"- Anyway, Jake, did you follow the controversy"
01:37:04;01:37:06;"with Billie Eilish and Van Halen?"
01:37:06;01:37:08;"- Yes, I did. - Okay, first of all--"
01:37:08;01:37:10;"- It seemed like it was kind of set up, though, right?"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"It was on, like, one of those late night shows?"
01:37:12;01:37:13;"- Yeah. - Jimmy Kimmel--"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"- You've heard of-- - Jimmy Kimmel just naming stuff"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"and she's like-- - Like, who else did he name?"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"- I don't know. - Roger Daltry,"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"have you heard of him? No."
01:37:21;01:37:22;"[laughter]"
01:37:22;01:37:25;"Van Halen, no."
01:37:25;01:37:28;"She's heard of Van Halen. - Rat with two Ts."
01:37:28;01:37:32;"- Right. I mean, Van Halen coming out of Pasadena,"
01:37:32;01:37:34;"neighboring community to Highland Park."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"- That's true. - She knows who Van Halen is."
01:37:36;01:37:38;"- But also, I gotta say, every time I see"
01:37:38;01:37:40;"one of these controversies like this,"
01:37:40;01:37:42;"if you see, like, a bunch of articles,"
01:37:42;01:37:44;"like, ""Oh, everybody's freaking out,"""
01:37:44;01:37:46;"and you dig a little deeper and then, like, say,"
01:37:46;01:37:48;"you go look on Twitter or something,"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"it's all noise, you know?"
01:37:50;01:37:52;"Like, the signal-to-noise ratio is all messed up"
01:37:52;01:37:54;"because basically you'll find hundreds of thousands"
01:37:54;01:37:57;"of tweets being like, ""Leave Billie Eilish alone."
01:37:57;01:38:00;"""She's only 17. Of course she doesn't know Van Halen."
01:38:00;01:38:02;"""That's old-ass music. Oh, my God."
01:38:02;01:38:03;"Why are all these people so upset?"""
01:38:03;01:38:05;"You see all, like, the commentary that's kind of like,"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"""Leave her alone,"" and then you see, of course,"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"people making jokes just like, ""Ah, whatever,"""
01:38:09;01:38:11;"and you're kind of like, ""Where are the outrage tweets?"""
01:38:11;01:38:13;"And I'm sure they exist here and there,"
01:38:13;01:38:16;"but it's, like, way more people are talking about it."
01:38:16;01:38:18;"Because I think-- - It's hilarious."
01:38:18;01:38:20;"- Even if you're, like, a hardcore Van Halen fan,"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"you're, like, 55 or something, someone's like,"
01:38:22;01:38:24;"""Yo, you know that Billie Eil--?"""
01:38:24;01:38:26;"If you're truly a deep Van Halen fan,"
01:38:26;01:38:28;"you wouldn't know who Billie Eilish is."
01:38:28;01:38:30;"It's a weird thing kind of stoked by people"
01:38:30;01:38:32;"who don't really care about either artist, I think,"
01:38:32;01:38:35;"who are just kind of, like, stirring the pot."
01:38:35;01:38:37;"This happened a lot in hip-hop in the past few years."
01:38:37;01:38:39;"They would ask a young rapper, like,"
01:38:39;01:38:40;"""Do you care about Tupac?"""
01:38:40;01:38:42;"And they'd just be like, ""Not really."""
01:38:42;01:38:44;"And then it'd just be like, ""Oh, [bleep]."""
01:38:44;01:38:45;"But now it kind of feels so, like--"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"Yeah, like you said, set up."
01:38:47;01:38:49;"- I mean, it's totally conceivable that a 17-year-old"
01:38:49;01:38:51;"has never heard of Van Halen."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"That's not shocking at all."
01:38:53;01:38:55;"I kind of think she has,"
01:38:55;01:38:59;"and I think it was just all play acting for the TV show."
01:38:59;01:39:01;"- Well, she's probably pretty savvy."
01:39:01;01:39:03;"I'm sure if you're behind closed doors, you're like,"
01:39:03;01:39:04;"""If you were going on Jimmy Kimmel,"
01:39:04;01:39:07;"""would it be cooler to say you know Van Halen or you don't?"""
01:39:07;01:39:08;"It's cooler to say you don't."
01:39:08;01:39:10;"I would also say--and I might be wrong here,"
01:39:10;01:39:13;"but, like, I've never been, like, deep into Van Halen."
01:39:13;01:39:15;"- Same here. - I like what I've heard."
01:39:15;01:39:17;"But I've always been, like--"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"I felt like they didn't play much Van Halen"
01:39:19;01:39:21;"on my local rock radio station."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"- Oh, really? I mean, they're playing ""Jump."""
01:39:22;01:39:24;"They're playing ""Runnin' with the Devil."""
01:39:24;01:39:28;"- Not that--my local station had a kind of anti-'80s bias."
01:39:28;01:39:30;"So they weren't playing, like-- - I like that."
01:39:30;01:39:32;"- They weren't playing classic rock stuff that was, like, synthy."
01:39:32;01:39:34;"So, like, they'd never play ""Panama."""
01:39:34;01:39:35;"I mean, I'm sure they did here and there,"
01:39:35;01:39:37;"but when I think about what they played,"
01:39:37;01:39:39;"I'm thinking, like, ""Boston"" more than a feeling."
01:39:39;01:39:41;"- Oh, sure. - I'm not picturing '80s Van Halen."
01:39:41;01:39:44;"And so I just never felt like I knew Van Halen that much."
01:39:44;01:39:46;"My parents definitely didn't give a [bleep] about Van Halen."
01:39:46;01:39:48;"And then I would watch, like, VH1 or something,"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"and for some reason on VH1 and MTV,"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"whenever they'd do some, like, throwback,"
01:39:52;01:39:55;"the song they would always reference is ""Hot for Teacher."""
01:39:55;01:39:56;"So for a long time, I was like,"
01:39:56;01:39:59;"""That's the big Van Halen song, 'Hot for Teacher.'"
01:39:59;01:40:02;"All right, kind of like a weird goofball novelty song"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"about being horny for your teacher."""
01:40:04;01:40:06;"Like, cool. - Pretty weak."
01:40:06;01:40:09;"- I was never that big of a fan, and then, like, you know,"
01:40:09;01:40:10;"I was somewhat familiar with the fact"
01:40:10;01:40:11;"that they, like, hated each other"
01:40:11;01:40:14;"and that David Lee Roth was kind of like, ""This is wild, dude."""
01:40:14;01:40:15;"So actually, I saw them once at the Garden."
01:40:15;01:40:17;"I think I've talked about this on the show."
01:40:17;01:40:20;"And I was just kind of like... - ""Why didn't you go?"""
01:40:20;01:40:21;"- I was just--I don't know, like..."
01:40:21;01:40:23;"- ""Ain't nothing going on."" - All the cool kids were going."
01:40:23;01:40:25;"I don't know. I was invited to the Garden."
01:40:25;01:40:28;"And also, they--I was told that we would be in a box."
01:40:28;01:40:31;"So you know you're gonna be having access to chicken wangs."
01:40:31;01:40:35;"- Wings and fingers. - Wangs, fangers."
01:40:35;01:40:37;"Wangers and fangers. - Maybe a Caesar salad."
01:40:37;01:40:39;"- So I'm just saying, I've never been particularly attached"
01:40:39;01:40:44;"to Van Halen, so, like, I do kind of weirdly feel like--"
01:40:44;01:40:47;"and maybe because I straddled generations, like, you know,"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"my parents weren't paying attention to rock music"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"in the '80s, nor was I. - Yeah."
01:40:51;01:40:53;"- So there's a part of me that's kind of like--"
01:40:53;01:40:54;"I could see if you asked a young artist,"
01:40:54;01:40:56;"""Do you know the Beatles or the Rolling Stones?"""
01:40:56;01:40:59;"And they said no, that would seem like they're fronting"
01:40:59;01:41:02;"because, like, you would absolutely have familiarity"
01:41:02;01:41:04;"with the name of those artists. - Yeah."
01:41:04;01:41:07;"- Led Zeppelin, Nirvana. - Yeah."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"- I actually wouldn't put Van Halen, like--"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"they're definitely not top five bands"
01:41:11;01:41:13;"in terms of name recognition. - No."
01:41:13;01:41:16;"- So I'm already kind of like, that doesn't seem that weird."
01:41:16;01:41:18;"- Let's put this to the listeners."
01:41:18;01:41:20;"Guys listening at home, do you feel like Billie Eilish"
01:41:20;01:41:23;"knows who Van Halen really is, or was she fronting?"
01:41:23;01:41:26;"Tweet us @TimeCrisis2000 on Twitter"
01:41:26;01:41:27;"and follow us while you're there."
01:41:27;01:41:30;"- If you're just tuning in, we've got a breaking story."
01:41:30;01:41:31;"It's some of the biggest controversy"
01:41:31;01:41:33;"in the music industry in years."
01:41:33;01:41:35;"Billie Eilish, her parents-- [laughs]"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"- This is awesome. - Maybe--"
01:41:37;01:41:39;"- This happened, like, a month ago."
01:41:39;01:41:41;"But-- - Maybe it's one of those things"
01:41:41;01:41:43;"where, like, she couldn't name a Van Halen song,"
01:41:43;01:41:45;"but if you played her the riff from ""Jump,"""
01:41:45;01:41:47;"she'd be like, ""Oh, yeah, okay."""
01:41:47;01:41:48;"Yeah, that's-- - Yeah."
01:41:48;01:41:50;"- Sure. - I was getting my haircut"
01:41:50;01:41:52;"down at the Hive. - [imitates ""Jump"" riff]"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"- Guys, this was only last week."
01:41:54;01:41:55;"- Oh, this was only last week?"
01:41:55;01:41:57;"- Well, this is relatively current for us."
01:41:57;01:42:00;"- Yeah. - Was she, like, 17, 18?"
01:42:00;01:42:02;"I feel like this would be-- - She was definitely born"
01:42:02;01:42:03;"in the 2000s. - Right."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"- Like, this would be, like, asking you as a teenager"
01:42:05;01:42:08;"if you know, like, the Swig Band all time,"
01:42:08;01:42:09;"you know what I mean?"
01:42:09;01:42:11;"- Wait, music from, like, 40 years ago?"
01:42:11;01:42:12;"- You're talking a band-- - That's not true."
01:42:12;01:42:15;"- A band that was massive 20 years before you were born."
01:42:15;01:42:19;"- Ezra, are you familiar with Jerry Lewis and the Playboys?"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"- [laughs] - Gary Lewis and the Playboys."
01:42:21;01:42:24;"- No, no, uh, was it Bob Willis and his Texas Playboys?"
01:42:24;01:42:26;"Oh, no, Gary--Gary and the--"
01:42:26;01:42:28;"- I was, like, mid-60s, like, kind of, like--"
01:42:28;01:42:30;"- I'm sure if you sat there with Billie Eilish"
01:42:30;01:42:33;"and you just, like, grabbed, like, the Rolling Stone,"
01:42:33;01:42:34;"50 most important bands of all time,"
01:42:34;01:42:37;"she'd probably know at least, like, 25% of it."
01:42:37;01:42:39;"I bet she would know Guns N' Roses."
01:42:39;01:42:40;"- For sure."
01:42:40;01:42:42;"- Also, like, if you're from L.A."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"I know Van Halen's from L.A., but it's, like--"
01:42:44;01:42:46;"- Pasadena, dude, neighboring community."
01:42:46;01:42:49;"- They actually don't-- neighboring community of Pasadena."
01:42:49;01:42:52;"I would also make the case that Van Halen kind of, like--"
01:42:52;01:42:54;"of course they have so many massive songs,"
01:42:54;01:42:57;"but kind of, like, how I had my weird kind of, like,"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"confusion with ""Hot for Teacher"" being, like, their big song."
01:42:59;01:43:02;"They don't have a ""Welcome to the Jungle."""
01:43:02;01:43:03;"- ""Jump,"" dude."
01:43:03;01:43:06;"- ""Jump"" is hard to wrap your head around in the 2000s."
01:43:06;01:43:07;"- I think that's their biggest song."
01:43:07;01:43:08;"- It's a great song, but--"
01:43:08;01:43:10;"- I think that's as big as ""Welcome."""
01:43:10;01:43:14;"- But ""Welcome to the Jungle"" is-- it just means more."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"It comes up more in conversation."
01:43:16;01:43:17;"I make a reference to ""Welcome to the Jungle,"""
01:43:17;01:43:19;"like, once a week. - Sure."
01:43:19;01:43:21;"- Because it's the type of thing where something could happen"
01:43:21;01:43:23;"or you enter a new place"
01:43:23;01:43:25;"or somebody refers to things having changed"
01:43:25;01:43:27;"and you can just be like, ""Welcome to the Jungle."""
01:43:27;01:43:29;"- I remember the week I moved to L.A.,"
01:43:29;01:43:32;"I met up with my uncle, and he was just like,"
01:43:32;01:43:33;"""So you moved here, huh?"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"""Welcome to the Jungle, baby."""
01:43:35;01:43:36;"- Yep, see?"
01:43:36;01:43:38;"""Welcome to the Jungle"" is a very useful phrase,"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"especially when you live in L.A."
01:43:40;01:43:41;"- Yep. - It's definitely one of the"
01:43:41;01:43:42;"top five best things about L.A."
01:43:42;01:43:44;"is that you can say ""Welcome to the Jungle"" all the time."
01:43:44;01:43:45;"- I just did a quick number crutch."
01:43:45;01:43:48;"I just want to call out that ""Jump"" hit number one"
01:43:48;01:43:50;"on the Billboard Hot 100."
01:43:50;01:43:52;"""Welcome to the Jungle"" peaked at number seven."
01:43:52;01:43:56;"- Also, ""Jump"" was briefly banned from a lot of radio"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"after--that was a famous story--"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"after 9/11, all the big radio conglomerates"
01:44:00;01:44:04;"put out a list of songs to ban that might be triggering"

01:53:46;01:53:48;"This is a massive song."
01:53:48;01:53:49;"Well, it's a cool one."
01:53:49;01:53:51;"Yeah, this is a good song."
01:53:51;01:53:54;"[MUSIC - POST MALONE, ""SUNFLOWER""]"
01:53:54;01:54:10;"So far, everything kind of mellow."
01:54:10;01:54:11;"Yeah."
01:54:11;01:54:12;"It's a mellow year."
01:54:12;01:54:15;"[MUSIC - POST MALONE, ""SUNFLOWER""]"
01:54:15;01:54:19;"Great song."
01:54:19;01:54:21;"Post Malone just continues to crush it."
01:54:21;01:54:23;"This song is already his old muse for him."
01:54:23;01:54:26;"This song came out in 2018, actually."
01:54:26;01:54:28;"He's got a big song with Ozzy Osbourne right now."
01:54:28;01:54:30;"Right, I think we heard it on the show."
01:54:30;01:54:31;"Yeah."
01:54:31;01:54:33;"Do you think Billie Eilish has heard it with him?"
01:54:33;01:54:34;"Ozzy?"
01:54:34;01:54:35;"Definitely."
01:54:35;01:54:36;"From the show?"
01:54:36;01:54:37;"Yeah, from reality TV."
01:54:37;01:54:38;"Well, think about it."
01:54:38;01:54:41;"She would have been really young when the show was popping."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"I hate to say it."
01:54:42;01:54:45;"I don't want to wade into what already is a fake controversy"
01:54:45;01:54:47;"that nobody actually cares about."
01:54:47;01:54:50;"But I like some of the Van Halen stuff."
01:54:50;01:54:52;"But they're freaking random."
01:54:52;01:54:54;"I'm sorry, Van Halen's freaking random."
01:54:54;01:54:55;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"They're stuck in an era, you're saying."
01:54:57;01:54:58;"Yeah, do you know what I mean?"
01:54:58;01:54:59;"They're freaking random."
01:54:59;01:55:00;"Right."
01:55:00;01:55:04;"Dude, I was talking to this contractor last week."
01:55:04;01:55:06;"About what kind of rock he was into?"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"Well, actually, it did come up."
01:55:08;01:55:12;"He told me that he's a big Ozzy fan,"
01:55:12;01:55:13;"that he doesn't like Sabbath."
01:55:13;01:55:14;"What the hell?"
01:55:14;01:55:15;"I was like, what the hell?"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"This guy was like mid-50s."
01:55:17;01:55:20;"And he's like, I'm really into the crazy train stuff."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"He's a Randy Rhoads fan."
01:55:22;01:55:25;"Yeah, no, he specifically shouted out Randy Rhoads."
01:55:25;01:55:28;"I was like, you like the first Sabbath album and stuff?"
01:55:28;01:55:29;"And he's like, you know what?"
01:55:29;01:55:32;"My wife and I put that on last year, and it's just too dark."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"Whoa."
01:55:33;01:55:34;"Not a Sabbath guy."
01:55:34;01:55:36;"Osborne, soul and material."
01:55:36;01:55:40;"That's like the TC heads who don't [BLEEP] with Vampire Weekend."
01:55:40;01:55:42;"Wait, by the way, I was thinking about this"
01:55:42;01:55:45;"when we were talking about Billie Eilish and how young she is."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"We got a very funny email."
01:55:47;01:55:49;"This is from a young person named Vera."
01:55:49;01:55:53;"Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
01:55:53;01:55:54;"Subject, time crisis."
01:55:54;01:55:58;"Dear Jake Longstreth and Ezra Koenig of the internet radio show Time Crisis,"
01:55:58;01:56:00;"my name is Vera."
01:56:00;01:56:03;"I'm a middle school student at an NYC public school."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"I like that she specified public school."
01:56:05;01:56:07;"Gives her more credibility."
01:56:07;01:56:10;"I'm a huge fan of Time Crisis, and I've re-listened to all of the episodes"
01:56:10;01:56:11;"multiple times."
01:56:11;01:56:12;"Wow."
01:56:12;01:56:14;"Yeah, that would require just years."
01:56:14;01:56:17;"You couldn't be a full-time public school student and pull that off."
01:56:17;01:56:18;"Well, maybe a lot."
01:56:18;01:56:21;"I've mentioned Time Crisis to many acquaintances of mine"
01:56:21;01:56:22;"and recommend it."
01:56:22;01:56:23;"Thank you."
01:56:23;01:56:28;"You know, I don't say this enough, but Time Crisis thrives on word of mouth."
01:56:28;01:56:30;"A few of these acquaintances got back to me"
01:56:30;01:56:32;"and either said it was lame or boring,"
01:56:32;01:56:35;"or they didn't get or understand what you were talking about."
01:56:35;01:56:39;"Such topics include the McRib, Seinfeld, and the Grateful Dead."
01:56:39;01:56:41;"Which brings me back to my initial question,"
01:56:41;01:56:43;"what age group is Time Crisis targeted towards?"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"Sincerely, Vera, a fan of the show."
01:56:45;01:56:47;"Is this email fake?"
01:56:47;01:56:48;"What was your guy's gut?"
01:56:48;01:56:49;"No."
01:56:49;01:56:50;"What was your blink moment?"
01:56:50;01:56:51;"I bought it."
01:56:51;01:56:52;"You buy that this is a middle schooler?"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"That didn't even cross my mind that it was fake."
01:56:54;01:56:55;"Yeah."
01:56:55;01:56:56;"What would be the end game?"
01:56:56;01:56:57;"Just the part--"
01:56:57;01:57:01;"I'm just saying, such topics include the McRib, Seinfeld,"
01:57:01;01:57:02;"and the Grateful Dead."
01:57:02;01:57:05;"I guess by middle school, there's something about the sense of humor"
01:57:05;01:57:06;"that I felt like--"
01:57:06;01:57:07;"No, you're right."
01:57:07;01:57:09;"I could buy that it's a real middle school student."
01:57:09;01:57:12;"And I also buy that her friends thought the show was lame and boring."
01:57:12;01:57:13;"I mean, what are they into?"
01:57:13;01:57:14;"Fortnite?"
01:57:14;01:57:15;"I don't know."
01:57:15;01:57:16;"Yeah."
01:57:16;01:57:18;"Billie Eilish and Fortnite."
01:57:18;01:57:19;"It's a cool vibe."
01:57:19;01:57:22;"It's a little bit hard for me to understand what anybody of any age"
01:57:22;01:57:25;"would make of this show if you were just like recommended an episode."
01:57:25;01:57:26;"Right."
01:57:26;01:57:30;"I could see that somebody might recommend one of the big guest interviews."
01:57:30;01:57:31;"Right."
01:57:31;01:57:33;"Like definitely a lot of people brought up the Justin Vernon interview"
01:57:33;01:57:36;"because that's the type of thing that you're going to get just like a"
01:57:36;01:57:39;"Boney Ver fan is going to check it out."
01:57:39;01:57:42;"But even if you were like a fan-- if you're like a real TC head"
01:57:42;01:57:44;"and you're trying to get somebody in, you're like,"
01:57:44;01:57:46;"you knew they liked Boney Ver, you might be like, check out that episode."
01:57:46;01:57:49;"Then they listen to the one after, you're probably just like,"
01:57:49;01:57:50;"what the [bleep] is this?"
01:57:50;01:57:51;"Right."
01:57:51;01:57:52;"Yeah, I don't know."
01:57:52;01:57:55;"When they break down Jet versus Tim and Paula, it's so sick."
01:57:55;01:57:56;"I mean--"
01:57:56;01:57:59;"Even that's an easier entry point than--"
01:57:59;01:58:00;"The McRib."
01:58:00;01:58:01;"Yeah."
01:58:01;01:58:02;"Lonnie's dad."
01:58:02;01:58:06;"Yeah, if you can't understand why Jake's Lonnie's dad story"
01:58:06;01:58:11;"is one of the greatest stories of all time, you're never going to get TC."
01:58:11;01:58:14;"I also feel it's funny because you can't really-- you can't be like,"
01:58:14;01:58:16;"you know what, you really got to start at the beginning."
01:58:16;01:58:18;"Right, because that would throw people off too because--"
01:58:18;01:58:21;"what's the fan consensus, Seinfeld?"
01:58:21;01:58:23;"When does TC really find its voice?"
01:58:23;01:58:26;"People say episodes like 60 or like what--"
01:58:26;01:58:28;"[laughter]"
01:58:28;01:58:30;"No, I've been--"
01:58:30;01:58:31;"You're serious?"
01:58:31;01:58:33;"I've been creeping, yeah, because it was the run--"
01:58:33;01:58:36;"people will often say the run between Lonnie's dad and--"
01:58:36;01:58:38;"[laughter]"
01:58:38;01:58:42;"It's about 120 hours worth of tape."
01:58:42;01:58:45;"They started to figure out what they were doing."
01:58:45;01:58:50;"Now that we're so deep, are we ready to have a Talking Dead post show?"
01:58:50;01:58:52;"[laughter]"
01:58:52;01:58:56;"That's just a couple TC heads."
01:58:56;01:58:58;"Yeah, I would say the show really found its voice in that run"
01:58:58;01:59:00;"between Lonnie's dad and--"
01:59:00;01:59:02;"A Star is Born, probably."
01:59:02;01:59:04;"I hope earlier than that."
01:59:04;01:59:06;"Well, there's another fact--"
01:59:06;01:59:08;"Some people will also say that like--"
01:59:08;01:59:10;"We lost our voice then?"
01:59:10;01:59:13;"No, no, the show--"
01:59:13;01:59:16;"you know, the first few episodes, it was really finding its footing."
01:59:16;01:59:17;"Oh, yeah, of course."
01:59:17;01:59:19;"The first five episodes or something."
01:59:19;01:59:21;"We didn't know what was going on."
01:59:21;01:59:23;"We were like, ""Oh, we're going to crash."""
01:59:23;01:59:25;"Although the first episode--"
01:59:25;01:59:27;"Wait, the first episode is Mark Ronson, right?"
01:59:27;01:59:29;"Yeah, that's right."
01:59:29;01:59:31;"And isn't Rashida on that episode?"
01:59:31;01:59:33;"We had Rashida--"
01:59:33;01:59:35;"A lot more music back then."
01:59:35;01:59:36;"We had way more music."
01:59:36;01:59:37;"A lot of Billy Joel."
01:59:37;01:59:40;"I had to fight tooth and nail against the powers that be."
01:59:40;01:59:42;"I said, ""You know what, guys?"
01:59:42;01:59:43;"Nobody likes music anymore."
01:59:43;01:59:44;"Trust me."
01:59:44;01:59:45;"I'm a musician."
01:59:45;01:59:46;"I'm on the front lines."
01:59:46;01:59:47;"Music is over."""
01:59:47;01:59:49;"Music's for squares."
01:59:49;01:59:50;"Music's for squares."
01:59:50;01:59:53;"And finally let me turn this into what it is--"
01:59:53;01:59:56;"a real internet talk radio show."
01:59:56;01:59:58;"Yeah, we had some of Rashida's son and some of her--"
01:59:58;02:00:03;"because that's when I was really trying to make it a professional show."
02:00:03;02:00:05;"So I was like, Rashida has all these amazing stories."
02:00:05;02:00:07;"And they're so short, some of them."
02:00:07;02:00:10;"Like, oh, I went to the prom with Robin Thicke or something."
02:00:10;02:00:12;"You know, ""Bubbles"" bit me."
02:00:12;02:00:14;"I was like, ""All right, that could be great."""
02:00:14;02:00:17;"You know, just like a real show with segments and moments and stuff."
02:00:17;02:00:20;"Yeah, you got Desus and Mero on their first episode."
02:00:20;02:00:21;"That's right."
02:00:21;02:00:22;"Gerard was early on."
02:00:22;02:00:24;"Yeah, Azealia Banks."
02:00:24;02:00:25;"Oh, yeah."
02:00:25;02:00:26;"Shout out to Azealia."
02:00:26;02:00:27;"I was on that app."
02:00:27;02:00:28;"Right."
02:00:28;02:00:29;"I think it was my first app."
02:00:29;02:00:32;"That was a pretty legendary post-show dinner."
02:00:32;02:00:33;"Yep."
02:00:33;02:00:35;"Me, you, Azealia, Rashida."
02:00:35;02:00:36;"Yep."
02:00:36;02:00:37;"Wow."
02:00:37;02:00:39;"Maybe Seinfeld wasn't on there yet."
02:00:39;02:00:40;"No, Seinfeld came in--"
02:00:40;02:00:41;"No, I didn't come in."
02:00:41;02:00:42;"--because Seinfeld was still in Canada."
02:00:42;02:00:43;"That's right."
02:00:43;02:00:44;"We used to do those post-show dinners."
02:00:44;02:00:45;"Yeah."
02:00:45;02:00:46;"We did that like--"
02:00:46;02:00:47;"Oh, what was that?"
02:00:47;02:00:48;"--a lot of--"
02:00:48;02:00:49;"Six, eight times probably."
02:00:49;02:00:50;"Wow."
02:00:50;02:00:53;"Well, I think also because back then, Jake, you were still kind of like a guest."
02:00:53;02:00:54;"Yeah."
02:00:54;02:00:56;"So you weren't an official part of the structure."
02:00:56;02:00:57;"Right."
02:00:57;02:01:00;"You know, so I kind of felt like Jake's being nice by being a guest on the show should take"
02:01:00;02:01:01;"him out to dinner."
02:01:01;02:01:02;"Very sweet of you."
02:01:02;02:01:03;"We had some good dinners."
02:01:03;02:01:06;"Did you guys go to dinner with JB Fox?"
02:01:06;02:01:08;"No, he had to leave."
02:01:08;02:01:09;"Okay."
02:01:09;02:01:13;"Yeah, I mean, I invited him personally to stick around and have dinner with us."
02:01:13;02:01:15;"I mean, he has core Crisis crew."
02:01:15;02:01:17;"I don't know why he would have bailed."
02:01:17;02:01:20;"Maybe we got to get Jamie back on the program."
02:01:20;02:01:21;"Yeah."
02:01:21;02:01:25;"Anyway, it's no surprise what the number one most streamed song of the year is."
02:01:25;02:01:27;"Wait, let me guess."
02:01:27;02:01:29;"I can't guess."
02:01:29;02:01:30;"You know what it is."
02:01:31;02:01:32;"In your heart."
02:01:32;02:01:33;"Man or woman."
02:01:33;02:01:36;"I believe this person identifies as a man."
02:01:36;02:01:39;"Can I give you a hint?"
02:01:39;02:01:41;"Actually, it's two men."
02:01:41;02:01:42;"Give me a hint."
02:01:42;02:01:43;"One-- yeah."
02:01:43;02:01:44;"It's two men."
02:01:44;02:01:46;"Album of the year nominee."
02:01:46;02:01:52;"An album of the year nominee, but kind of a little shorter than most albums."
02:01:52;02:01:53;"Oh, oh, oh."
02:01:53;02:01:54;"Old Town Road."
02:01:54;02:01:56;"Old Town Road."
02:01:56;02:01:59;"Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus."
02:01:59;02:02:00;"Right."
02:02:00;02:02:02;"God, this is random."
02:02:02;02:02:04;"This is the number one song."
02:02:04;02:02:11;"The two albums from Columbia Records that are up for album of the year, Vampire and Lil Nas X."
02:02:11;02:02:12;"That's tight."
02:02:12;02:02:16;"Old Town Road, I'm gonna ride till I can't no more."
02:02:16;02:02:20;"Gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road."
02:02:20;02:02:23;"I'm gonna ride till I can't no more."
02:02:23;02:02:25;"I got the horses in the back."
02:02:25;02:02:27;"Horse tack is attached."
02:02:27;02:02:29;"Hattie's maddie black."
02:02:29;02:02:30;"Everybody loves Lil Nas X."
02:02:30;02:02:35;"I was sad to see he was tweeting about-- what did he tweet, Seinfeld?"
02:02:35;02:02:39;"He was just saying, like, Vampire Weekend just, like, needs to step it up."
02:02:39;02:02:40;"All this stuff."
02:02:40;02:02:41;"No, I don't know."
02:02:41;02:02:46;"He said he has so much respect for all of his fellow nominees except for Vampire Weekend."
02:02:46;02:02:48;"That he's depressed and that he can get down."
02:02:48;02:02:52;"I think it was probably sort of in response to Juice WRLD."
02:02:52;02:02:54;"Oh, yeah."
02:02:54;02:02:55;"RIP Juice WRLD."
02:02:55;02:02:56;"Man."
02:02:56;02:03:01;"He said, ""I like to pretend hate and s--t don't get to me, but subconsciously it eats away at me."
02:03:01;02:03:06;"Feeling like you have the world and knowing it can all go away at any time is scary."
02:03:06;02:03:11;"With all this being said, I don't want anybody who cared enough to read this to just live in the moment."
02:03:11;02:03:13;"Love you guys."""
02:03:13;02:03:16;"Oh, I want everybody to live in the moment."
02:03:16;02:03:18;"And then he followed it up."
02:03:18;02:03:24;"""Usually I deal with my sad times in private because I don't like for my fans or family to feel sorry for me."
02:03:24;02:03:28;"This year had a lot of very high ups and extremely low downs."
02:03:28;02:03:32;"When you get that hotel room and it's just you, you do a lot of thinking."
02:03:32;02:03:35;"Small things become so big."""
02:03:35;02:03:36;"Wow."
02:03:36;02:03:38;"I mean, it's not hard to imagine."
02:03:38;02:03:39;"It is funny."
02:03:39;02:03:42;"It's one of those things that the world will never believe."
02:03:42;02:03:47;"I think we've talked about this before, the common theme, like going back to the Eagles and before."
02:03:47;02:03:52;"Even A Star is Born, going back to the original A Star is Born, the '20s or '30s or whatever,"
02:03:52;02:03:59;"this theme that fame, this coveted thing, almost invariably brings some type of misery."
02:03:59;02:04:06;"And yet Don Henley can make his best case to try to help people understand that fame can be like a prison,"
02:04:06;02:04:10;"and yet every generation, it's kind of like a blank slate."
02:04:10;02:04:13;"You got to learn these lessons yourself."
02:04:13;02:04:17;"And I'm sure there's more to the story of what he's saying, these extremely low points,"
02:04:17;02:04:25;"but at least one thing he's saying is that all his success has brought anxiety of not being successful in the future."
02:04:25;02:04:27;"That's some real s***."
02:04:27;02:04:32;"You get used to being successful and having fans and things like that."
02:04:32;02:04:36;"It's not that easy to say, ""Well, it's great. I had that for a minute. Some people never have that."
02:04:36;02:04:40;"Now let me just go back to being me riding horses."""
02:04:40;02:04:42;"But you know what? That's the f***ed up thing."
02:04:42;02:04:44;"It's very Fitzgeraldian."
02:04:44;02:04:46;"You can't go back to the old town road."
02:04:46;02:04:47;"You're in the new town now."
02:04:47;02:04:50;"And you know what's also f***ed up is like,"
02:04:50;02:04:55;"I wonder if one of the reasons that seeing somebody like Lil Nas X say that is very affecting to people."
02:04:55;02:04:58;"And this is at least one thing that crossed my mind as an artist."
02:04:58;02:05:04;"You look at somebody like Lil Nas X, somebody who can create literally the most streamed song of the whole year,"
02:05:04;02:05:07;"the biggest song, and it's half a joke song."
02:05:07;02:05:10;"It's like literally, he's not a cowboy and he had this song."
02:05:10;02:05:12;"It's like it has a kind of serious tone,"
02:05:12;02:05:17;"but he's somebody who started out basically being a Twitter comedian slash tweet deck or whatever."
02:05:17;02:05:24;"It's almost like Pagliacci or something where it's like there's some people who their music"
02:05:24;02:05:28;"and their public image, I think it's also why I don't want to go too extreme,"
02:05:28;02:05:30;"but you know, maybe think about Rob Williams or something."
02:05:30;02:05:37;"When there's people who's everything about their public persona and their art is about life is pain and suffering."
02:05:37;02:05:45;"And sometimes part of why we love to see like a funny person win or somebody who makes a song that wasn't even supposed to be a hit single."
02:05:45;02:05:50;"It's so pleasant because it's almost like they're disconnected from this brutal competitive world we live in."
02:05:50;02:05:52;"They remind us that life's not that serious."
02:05:52;02:05:57;"You can have a laugh and this like random song about horses, let's get Billy Ray Cyrus."
02:05:57;02:05:58;"And now it's the biggest song."
02:05:58;02:06:04;"In some ways, that's a more life affirming thing than when like some intense ballad goes to number one."
02:06:04;02:06:10;"Like it rules that like a young kid made a joke song and it like kind of changed culture."
02:06:10;02:06:14;"And you also hope that because the song has a lightness about it,"
02:06:14;02:06:18;"you would hope that the person does too, that they'd be a little more immune to some of this stuff."
02:06:18;02:06:21;"But then he's keeping it real talking about these things."
02:06:21;02:06:25;"And it reminds you, even the person who made the fun novelty song,"
02:06:25;02:06:31;"they get weighed down by the same anxieties that a Tom York or something would be."
02:06:31;02:06:34;"Everybody's worried about what's going to happen to me tomorrow."
02:06:34;02:06:38;"Will the things that feel good in my life now still feel good in the future?"
02:06:38;02:06:40;"Can I feel comfortable?"
02:06:40;02:06:41;"Am I isolated or alone?"
02:06:41;02:06:43;"You know, he's talking about being alone in the hotel room."
02:06:43;02:06:48;"So anyway, the one thing we can say is that these feelings are somewhat universal."
02:06:48;02:06:51;"Different people have different ways of dealing with them,"
02:06:51;02:06:57;"but it's kind of amazing how universal feelings of isolation and anxiety are across industries"
02:06:57;02:06:59;"and certainly within industries."
02:06:59;02:07:03;"So, you know, ending 2019 on a somewhat darker note, but..."
02:07:03;02:07:06;"You want to end on a slightly more positive note?"
02:07:06;02:07:14;"We could take a listen to our friend Patrick World, who gave us a TC year in review."
02:07:14;02:07:16;"Okay, this is perfect."
02:07:16;02:07:19;"And also keep your eyes peeled, Time Crisis 2000,"
02:07:19;02:07:26;"because we're going to be giving away all sorts of T-shirts that we've amassed over the years."
02:07:26;02:07:29;"Some that we made, a lot of bootleg stuff that's been sent our way."
02:07:29;02:07:31;"And we want to give back to the community."
02:07:31;02:07:35;"And Seinfeld, this is actually a real number crunch,"
02:07:35;02:07:41;"because when I deputized you to create and sell the popcorn raisin shirts,"
02:07:41;02:07:46;"I was very specific about the fact that the proceeds from these sales,"
02:07:46;02:07:52;"the money that we got from the deep fat-pocketed meat-eater fans,"
02:07:52;02:07:56;"would be turned around and sent to the broke vegan TC heads,"
02:07:56;02:08:03;"people who help the world by not eating meat, but don't have the money or the resources"
02:08:03;02:08:05;"to do it in a way that's easy."
02:08:05;02:08:10;"So, I'm almost scared to ask, because for all I know,"
02:08:10;02:08:14;"and during the fall of Seinfeld, you've lost your moral compass,"
02:08:14;02:08:16;"and for all I know, the money's gone."
02:08:16;02:08:19;"Please tell me this money has made it to the broke vegans."
02:08:19;02:08:22;"When that directive went out, Ezra, I took it seriously."
02:08:22;02:08:27;"I took a solemn pledge to make sure that those broke vegans were supported"
02:08:27;02:08:31;"by some ethical merch that also itself supports a great cause,"
02:08:31;02:08:35;"which is the awareness of popcorn and raisins as a delicious combination"
02:08:35;02:08:38;"of two beloved snack foods."
02:08:38;02:08:47;"And what I will say is that we were able to generate $1,511.71 in profits."
02:08:47;02:08:49;"- In profits? - Correct."
02:08:49;02:08:54;"- Wow. - So, once you divide that by the 25 broke vegans"
02:08:54;02:08:59;"who have emailed us, each with their own very specific case,"
02:08:59;02:09:07;"they are each left with $60.46, which will be disseminated among them via PayPal,"
02:09:07;02:09:10;"because I'm Canadian, I'm not really up on Venmo,"
02:09:10;02:09:14;"and that'll all be dispersed before the end of the year."
02:09:14;02:09:17;"- Wow. 60 bucks ahead, that's no joke. - Yeah."
02:09:17;02:09:21;"Especially come around Christmas time, people got to buy stocking stuffers"
02:09:21;02:09:24;"and things of that nature, people got to tighten their belts a little bit."
02:09:24;02:09:27;"$60 is a tidy sum."
02:09:27;02:09:30;"So I'm glad that's all going out to the broke vegan community,"
02:09:30;02:09:33;"and I want to personally thank-- - You're welcome."
02:09:33;02:09:38;"- All the people who bought the popcorn and raisins shirts."
02:09:38;02:09:41;"- Sure, and just the whole-- - And by the way, Seinfeld,"
02:09:41;02:09:44;"please forward me the Excel spreadsheet."
02:09:44;02:09:48;"I need to double-check those numbers. - Well, I would never abscond with the bread,"
02:09:48;02:09:52;"and I will gladly send you those numbers."
02:09:52;02:09:56;"Probably the most important number crunch I've done this year."
02:09:56;02:10:02;"So, you know, shout-out to myself as far as my own involvement in all of this."
02:10:02;02:10:04;"- Big money. - Let's do this Patrick World song."
02:10:04;02:10:06;"- All right. - Signing off."
02:10:06;02:10:10;"- Signing off for 2019. This is the Crisis Crew."
02:10:10;02:10:13;"Thanks to everybody for listening. We'll be back real soon."
02:10:13;02:10:18;"2020 is going to be the biggest and best year for the TC community yet."
02:10:18;02:10:20;"I guarantee it."
02:10:20;02:10:24;"We're going to continue with all the great TC segments that you love,"
02:10:24;02:10:28;"whether it's Top 5 or talking about classic rock."
02:10:28;02:10:32;"We're definitely going to be continuing the Fall of Seinfeld narrative arc,"
02:10:32;02:10:36;"which has just been getting rave reviews across the mediasphere."
02:10:36;02:10:39;"Have a safe and pleasant holiday season."
02:10:39;02:10:43;"Here's Patrick World with ""It's the End of the TCU Season, Rise and Shine."""
02:10:44;02:10:48;"This year it started with a real bang"
02:10:48;02:10:53;"Talking 'bout the Jamflow man, Ezra Jake and all the gang"
02:10:53;02:10:56;"New VW, tracks dropped two by two"
02:10:56;02:10:59;"Seinfeld's in Japan, only calls and when he can"
02:10:59;02:11:01;"Harmony Hall video, best spot on the show"
02:11:01;02:11:03;"Telling us our president's hat's from an egg"
02:11:03;02:11:05;"Ariana Grande with the cloud macchiato"
02:11:05;02:11:08;"Also, Bebe Rexha did a weird potato chip collabo"
02:11:08;02:11:13;"Cassie Davis noshes but she's interested in topics like the BJU"
02:11:13;02:11:18;"Eva Longoria, she'll direct the origin story of Flamin' Hot Cheetos"
02:11:18;02:11:21;"Mountain Brews, Mountain Time, Weird Beto, Subject Line, Subway Series, Portmanteau"
02:11:21;02:11:25;"NYC Homecoming Show, Huey Lewis, Bon Iver, Popcorn Race is finally here"
02:11:25;02:11:27;"Steve Miller, full of hate, Canada Kick on Paula's way"
02:11:27;02:11:29;"Father of the Bridesman, it's really been a ride there"
02:11:29;02:11:31;"Grammy nominees"
02:11:31;02:11:44;"It's the end of the TCU season"
02:11:44;02:11:50;"Rise and shine"
