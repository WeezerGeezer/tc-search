00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, the final episode of the 2016 election cycle."
00:07;00:16;"We'll be talking to Felix from Chapo Trap House, as well as Jennifer Sines, Chief Marketing Officer of the Frito-Lay Corporation."
00:16;00:21;"All this, plus the hits of 2016 and 1964."
00:21;00:25;"Two days till the election. This is..."
00:25;00:32;"Time Crisis with Ezra King. Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep."
00:32;00:33;"One."
00:33;00:39;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:39;00:46;"The war I felt, warming me, all my rightful chances"
00:46;00:53;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:53;01:00;"And so I dealt to the floor, one of us had to go"
01:00;01:05;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:05;01:11;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:11;01:16;"Keep an only bae"
01:16;01:21;"Staring at the ceiling"
01:21;01:28;"Wishing she was somewhere else instead"
01:28;01:31;"One of us is lying"
01:31;01:33;"Back in the studio. What's up, Jake?"
01:33;01:34;"Hey."
01:34;01:39;"Wow, this is a really crazy Sunday. It's the Sunday before the election."
01:39;01:40;"Very stressful."
01:40;01:43;"Very stressful. Don't know who's gonna win."
01:43;01:46;"The good news is that we got a sick show today."
01:46;01:49;"We have two sick guests calling in."
01:49;01:53;"First up, we're gonna have Felix Beiderman,"
01:53;01:57;"who is a dude I've followed on Twitter for a long time."
01:57;02:02;"He's a writer and co-host of a podcast called ""Chapo Trap House."""
02:02;02:04;"What's that podcast about?"
02:04;02:06;"Politics, basically."
02:06;02:10;"I guess they're guys you would call left-leaning, but very funny."
02:10;02:11;"Great."
02:11;02:15;"Then after that, we're gonna have probably, no disrespect to Felix,"
02:15;02:21;"but probably the great-- I imagine this is gonna be the greatest time crisis interview of all time."
02:21;02:24;"We got Jennifer Sines. You know who Jennifer Sines is?"
02:24;02:25;"I do."
02:25;02:26;"Who is she?"
02:26;02:32;"She is the chief marketing officer of the Frito-Lay Corporation of Plano, Texas."
02:32;02:33;"That's right."
02:33;02:36;"We've been talking a lot about snack foods over the past few months."
02:36;02:38;"We've been talking about Fritos, we've been talking about Doritos,"
02:38;02:40;"we've been talking about Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
02:40;02:45;"But this is the first time we're actually gonna talk to somebody who works at the Frito-Lay Corporation."
02:45;02:48;"So she's the chief marketing officer, aka the CMO."
02:48;02:52;"She's gonna tell us about how do these brands get marketed, how do they come into our lives,"
02:52;02:53;"what do they mean."
02:53;02:55;"I'm really looking forward to that one."
02:55;02:58;"But anyway, like we said, Sunday before the election."
02:58;03:00;"How are you feeling, man?"
03:00;03:03;"I'm good. I'm really ready for it to be over."
03:03;03:04;"I've been hearing that a lot."
03:04;03:06;"I mean, I'm sure everyone feels that way."
03:06;03:08;"Yeah, I'm ready for it to be over."
03:08;03:09;"I don't know."
03:09;03:10;"Did you vote yet?"
03:10;03:11;"Yeah."
03:11;03:12;"Mail-in?"
03:12;03:13;"I mailed in my ballot to New York."
03:13;03:14;"It's interesting."
03:14;03:15;"Gary Johnson?"
03:15;03:19;"I had to support my man, Gary Johnson."
03:19;03:21;"I want a president who doesn't know what Aleppo is."
03:21;03:23;"That guy is such a tool."
03:23;03:24;"Oh!"
03:24;03:26;"Yeah, he's a weirdo."
03:26;03:30;"I mean, look, my heart definitely was with the Green Party."
03:30;03:35;"But you and many other people have convinced me to make a pragmatic decision."
03:35;03:36;"You have to."
03:36;03:40;"And here's the thing. I do feel bad about not voting for the Green Party."
03:40;03:44;"Why? Jill Stein doesn't seem-- she's no Ralph Nader."
03:44;03:48;"The way people have gone in on Jill Stein is so lame."
03:48;03:53;"When I saw John Oliver roasting Jill Stein, trying to imply that she's anti-vaccines,"
03:53;03:59;"it's like, ""All right, man. Let's see you go that hard on some of the Democrats' goofball positions."
03:59;04:00;"I'm waiting."""
04:00;04:06;"To really try to disqualify the only candidate who wants to legalize weed,"
04:06;04:09;"has reasonable foreign policy ideas--"
04:09;04:12;"I don't know, to roast somebody that hard and be like, ""What a weirdo."""
04:12;04:16;"You are doing a disservice, I think, to the public discourse."
04:16;04:17;"That's my point of view."
04:17;04:21;"I feel bad about not voting for her because the system is rigged against third parties."
04:21;04:24;"There's been a lot of talk of rigging in this election."
04:24;04:26;"The system is rigged against a lot of people."
04:26;04:29;"Not Donald Trump."
04:29;04:31;"Not rigged against Hillary."
04:31;04:33;"And the voting system is not rigged."
04:33;04:35;"No, but here's the thing, man."
04:35;04:40;"For the third parties, like the Greens, to qualify for federal funding,"
04:40;04:43;"they need to get 5% of the vote."
04:43;04:51;"It should be 1% because 5% is the perfect number to terrify left-leaning people into not voting."
04:51;04:55;"Because if you took away 5% of Hillary's lead, you would feel like you're electing Trump."
04:55;05:00;"So rather than just say, ""Hey, we'll give federal funding to the five biggest parties in America,"""
05:00;05:04;"they make it so hard for the third parties to even get a leg up."
05:04;05:05;"You know what's also crazy?"
05:05;05:09;"The Green Party has to fight to even get on the ballot in a lot of places."
05:09;05:10;"What kind of system is that?"
05:10;05:15;"You can't even just put the ten biggest parties in America on the ballot everywhere."
05:15;05:18;"To literally not put parties on the ballot, that's rigged."
05:18;05:26;"Voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein is only going to diminish the amount by which"
05:26;05:29;"either candidate will win the popular vote."
05:29;05:33;"And if enough people do that, it might sway the vote one way or the other."
05:33;05:34;"I buy the pragmatic argument."
05:34;05:37;"That's why even in New York State, a solidly blue state,"
05:37;05:42;"I wanted to contribute to the sound defeat of Donald Trump."
05:42;05:46;"But at the same time, I was doing something against my moral principles."
05:46;05:51;"I was voting for a party whose platform is fundamentally less ethical than the Greens."
05:51;05:52;"So what am I supposed to do, man?"
05:52;05:55;"It was a completely rational, pragmatic thing to do."
05:55;05:58;"So then tell me some rational, pragmatic things that I can do"
05:58;06:03;"to make sure that the things that I believe in are supported by my government."
06:03;06:06;"Get super lefty people voted into Congress."
06:06;06:07;"Mayor."
06:07;06:08;"City Council."
06:08;06:10;"Sounds like a lot of work, man."
06:46;06:50;"You know, that's kind of the truth, is that probably a lot of us,"
06:50;06:54;"we get so obsessed with the presidential election because it's glamorous."
06:54;06:56;"It's kind of easy, in a way."
06:56;06:58;"I'm not saying it's easy to run for president,"
06:58;07:00;"but it's easy to be like, ""Who are you voting for for president?"""
07:00;07:02;"""Well, I like Hillary. Here's why."""
07:02;07:03;"""I like Jill Stein. Well, here's why."""
07:03;07:06;"And the truth is, I'm sure the Green Party has a lot of ideas,"
07:06;07:08;"and I should probably read up on them."
07:08;07:09;"Because I'll tell you what, man."
07:09;07:13;"You and I, we have a lot of political conversations with all sorts of people,"
07:13;07:18;"but 97% of it gets taken up by Hillary and Donald."
07:18;07:22;"Just like you were talking about how you didn't know who your congressperson was."
07:22;07:23;"Right."
07:23;07:24;"You had to look it up."
07:24;07:25;"Right."
07:25;07:27;"And I'm not blaming you, because many people don't--"
07:27;07:29;"they might know their senators before they know their congresspeople."
07:29;07:31;"You can't blame an individual."
07:31;07:35;"It's because when you go down to the bar, it's not a topic of conversation."
07:35;07:38;"You're chatting with everybody about the new Bon Iver album."
07:38;07:39;"Who?"
07:39;07:41;"[Laughs]"
07:41;07:43;"So I'm curious with you, Jake. You're a California voter, right?"
07:43;07:44;"Yeah."
07:44;07:47;"Are you going to vote yes on legalizing marijuana?"
07:47;07:48;"I think so."
07:48;07:50;"I need to take a hard look at this stuff tonight."
07:50;07:53;"I was talking about it on Twitter a few days ago."
07:53;07:55;"Look, people have some real arguments."
07:55;08:00;"It's almost like an Obamacare argument that, yes, this will legalize weed,"
08:00;08:03;"the same way that Obamacare provided health care for more people,"
08:03;08:07;"but a lot of the language favors big business."
08:07;08:08;"Right."
08:08;08:11;"So it's a tough one, and there are ways that probably some people,"
08:11;08:14;"small growers, could be victimized by it."
08:14;08:17;"But, man, it'll have a big ripple impact if it passes."
08:17;08:20;"One other one, what's your feeling on condoms and porn?"
08:20;08:24;"That's another thing that all California voters will be voting on on Tuesday."
08:24;08:25;"That I don't know."
08:25;08:28;"What do the adult performers think?"
08:28;08:32;"It seems like the vast majority of the adult performers say"
08:32;08:35;"we should get to choose if we use condoms and porn."
08:35;08:39;"It seems like the vast majority of the money going into the proposition"
08:39;08:42;"to force all adult entertainers to use condoms"
08:42;08:46;"was coming from one major AIDS organization."
08:46;08:48;"There's another one on the ballot this year."
08:48;08:50;"It's the death penalty one."
08:50;08:53;"About just, like, should we have it in California?"
08:53;08:55;"What's your thought on that, Matt?"
08:55;08:56;"Absolutely not."
08:56;08:57;"I'm with you."
08:57;09:02;"I'm really not into the death penalty, but that's a heavy topic, obviously."
09:02;09:03;"It's a heavy topic."
09:03;09:05;"But I was excited to see that that was on the ballot."
09:05;09:06;"It's not looking good."
09:06;09:08;"It's not going to pass?"
09:08;09:11;"There's a vengeful, irrational side to them"
09:11;09:14;"that makes them want to vote for the death penalty."
09:14;09:15;"Man."
09:15;09:17;"I'm just preaching to the choir over here."
09:17;09:20;"If you're, like, an atheist lefty type,"
09:20;09:22;"I think you would oppose the death penalty."
09:22;09:26;"And also if you're a deeply religious person, you know,"
09:26;09:29;"let God sort it out."
09:29;09:31;"If you've ever read the Bible,"
09:31;09:37;"the Lord has no problem in exercising extreme vengeance on the wicked."
09:37;09:39;"So why does man have to do it?"
09:39;09:41;"So I guess the people that are for the death penalty"
09:41;09:44;"are sort of, like, sort of Christians"
09:44;09:48;"that are sort of vengeful and are just emotional."
09:48;09:49;"Look, man, you know what?"
09:49;09:52;"You can spin any ideology to do what you want it to do."
09:52;09:53;"You know what I'm saying?"
09:53;09:54;"Of course."
09:54;09:59;"You can turn communism into a totalitarian nightmare,"
09:59;10:01;"as has happened here and there,"
10:01;10:04;"an ideology that's literally based on, like, the premise"
10:04;10:07;"that everybody should be equal and that--"
10:07;10:09;"- Goombaya, yeah. - Yeah."
10:09;10:12;"You can turn a religion of peace into a religion of violence,"
10:12;10:14;"as we've seen with all major religions."
10:14;10:15;"Yep."
10:15;10:19;"You can even turn something as rebellious as punk rock"
10:19;10:23;"into a corporate sellout lame thing."
10:23;10:25;"It's disgusting what people do."
10:25;10:28;"You could turn the hippie dream into an American nightmare."
10:28;10:30;"Into a Nike ad."
10:30;10:31;"That's right."
10:31;10:34;"♪ Gonna take a revolution ♪"
10:34;10:37;"Yeah, why don't we listen to ""Revolution"" by the Beatles,"
10:37;10:39;"a piece of art that's about revolution,"
10:39;10:41;"but with kind of a sarcastic tone."
10:41;10:44;"Lenin was very cynical and sarcastic"
10:44;10:48;"about the ""revolution"" that was happening."
10:48;10:50;"You know what year that song was from?"
10:50;10:51;"- '68. - You got it."
10:51;10:53;"A very tumultuous year."
10:53;10:57;"The 2016 of the '60s, as they say."
10:57;10:58;"Absolutely."
10:58;10:59;"So let's listen to that,"
10:59;11:02;"and then we're gonna call Felix Biderman from ""Chopper Trap House."""

14:57;14:59;"- How are you doing, man? Welcome to ""Time Crisis."""
14:59;15:01;"- I'm good. Thank you guys for having me on."
15:01;15:02;"- Our pleasure."
15:02;15:05;"So for people who are not familiar with you"
15:05;15:07;"and your podcast, can you tell us a little bit"
15:07;15:09;"about yourself, your perspective?"
15:09;15:12;"How do you describe your podcast, ""Choppo Trap House,"""
15:12;15:16;"when uncles or people on the street ask you what you do?"
15:16;15:21;"- ""Choppo Trap House"" is a media and politics podcast."

15:42;15:44;"- Okay, I hear that."
15:44;15:48;"And so outside of being a hardcore supporter"
15:48;15:50;"of the president of Turkey,"
15:50;15:52;"how do you describe your political stance?"

16:53;16:55;"It's hard to pick some singular moments,"
16:55;16:59;"because every day was equally parts hilarious"
16:59;17:01;"and terrifying."
17:01;17:03;"One of the funniest days of this year"
17:03;17:06;"was the day that Hillary fainted."
17:06;17:10;"The liberal commentators spent the first half of the day going,"
17:10;17:12;"""What are you talking about?"

17:24;17:28;"falling downstairs and saying it's how they get home."
17:28;17:31;"Then I remember it came out that she had pneumonia,"
17:31;17:33;"which, you know, it's fine."
17:33;17:34;"People get pneumonia."
17:34;17:36;"She's 70 years old. It happens."
17:36;17:39;"But it just showed the caginess and weirdness"
17:39;17:41;"of the Clinton campaign."
17:41;17:43;"They didn't tell anyone this."
17:43;17:47;"And the crazy Clinton loyalists--"
17:47;17:49;"loyalists diehards went,"
17:49;17:53;"""This proves that she is the strongest woman on Earth."
17:53;17:56;"""She is invincible."""
17:56;17:58;"There was a part where one guy said,"

18:00;18:03;"""and it's really tough to have because the antibiotics I had to get"
18:03;18:05;"""were the same kind you get for STDs,"
18:05;18:08;"""and I felt shamed by the pharmacist."""
18:08;18:11;"No one was around to tell that guy that no one thought he had sex."
18:11;18:14;"But I remember just watching all of this,"
18:14;18:17;"and I was in my room,"
18:17;18:19;"and I was taking it all in,"
18:19;18:22;"and I just started laughing so hard I was crying"
18:22;18:24;"because I saw an article titled-- it was like,"
18:24;18:27;"""Hillary proves once and for all"
18:27;18:31;"""that she has never lied and she is invincible."""
18:31;18:33;"And I was like, ""This is such a good day."""
18:33;18:34;"So there was that one."
18:34;18:36;"Right, it was a perfect situation"
18:36;18:39;"to see the nuttiness"
18:39;18:42;"of the Clinton diehards and the Trump diehards."
18:42;18:45;"So what were some other classic days for you in this election?"
18:45;18:48;"You know, when they came out with the Trump access Hollywood tape,"
18:48;18:50;"that was a good day."
18:50;18:52;"My favorite account on Twitter,"
18:52;18:55;"my favorite guy that I found during this election,"
18:55;18:58;"is a very enthusiastic Trump supporter named Bill Mitchell."
18:58;19:00;"You may have seen him."
19:00;19:03;"- Yes. - Yeah, he looks like Patrick Warburton."
19:03;19:05;"And he's just very enthusiastic."
19:05;19:08;"I like-- he's just, like, he's fun to watch,"
19:08;19:10;"and he just says the most ridiculous things"
19:10;19:13;"about why Trump is gonna win by a landslide."
19:13;19:16;"And, you know, these tapes were disgusting."
19:16;19:18;"It was Trump describing sexual assault."
19:18;19:20;"At the best of it, maybe you could argue"
19:20;19:22;"that Trump, like, he's never had sex"
19:22;19:24;"and was just trying to impress Billy Bush,"
19:24;19:26;"which is not great either."
19:26;19:28;"But he went, ""Look at the Bible."
19:28;19:31;"""David, sinner."
19:31;19:34;"""Paul, he killed Christians before he was saved."
19:34;19:36;"""The Bible is filled with flawed men."""
19:36;19:38;"That was Trump before he found God."
19:38;19:40;"You know, no one is perfect."
19:40;19:42;"Jesus Christ was perfect,"
19:42;19:45;"and he was crucified by the media of his day."
19:45;19:48;"And I was like, triple parentheses,"
19:48;19:50;"media of Jesus Christ's day."
19:50;19:53;"Triple parentheses, media killed Christ."
19:53;19:55;"That was a good day for the good men online."
19:55;19:59;"- Right, it increasingly seems that somebody like Trump"
19:59;20:02;"does something so brazenly insane"
20:02;20:06;"that you're gonna get these bizarre reactions,"
20:06;20:08;"either explaining why it's okay"
20:08;20:11;"or using it as an opportunity to kind of big up yourself"
20:11;20:14;"for not being as horrible as Donald Trump."
20:14;20:16;"How about one more, one more just great moment"
20:16;20:20;"for you in this election, in terms of the reactions?"
20:20;20:23;"- Okay, I would say it was--"
20:23;20:26;"there's a Newsweek reporter,"
20:26;20:28;"I'm not gonna say his name"

20:35;20:38;"for reporting against Trump for Newsweek."
20:38;20:41;"Since about, like, August of this year,"

20:43;20:45;"election-changing story about Trump."

20:50;20:52;"He's a business man in America."

31:47;31:49;"You know, one thing U2 deserves credit for"

31:54;31:57;"They transitioned from the '80s to the '90s very gracefully."
31:57;31:59;"- Yeah. - And that was a very difficult transition"
31:59;32:01;"for most rock bands."
32:01;32:03;"They went from their mid-'80s Joshua Tree earnestness"

32:11;32:14;"but it's, like, self-conscious or something."
32:14;32:17;"- Yeah, like, slightly ironic, post-modern."
32:17;32:19;"- Yeah. - I'm just saying, like,"
32:19;32:21;"the '80s and '90s had very different sensibilities,"
32:21;32:23;"like, in the--especially for U2,"

42:41;42:43;"We're very excited to have you on the show."
42:43;42:45;"- Hi, I'm happy to be here."
42:45;42:47;"- We've had a lot of great guests on the show before,"
42:47;42:50;"usually comedians and actors and musicians,"
42:50;42:54;"but this might be the one we've been the most excited about"
42:54;42:56;"'cause we've never had a chief marketing officer"
42:56;42:58;"on the show before."
42:58;43:00;"- I have to say I'm a little intimidated."
43:00;43:02;"That's some pretty good company to be in."
43:02;43:04;"- No, don't worry. This is the one that we've been"
43:04;43:06;"the most nervous about because..."
43:06;43:08;"- Okay. - Lately on the show,"
43:08;43:10;"we've been talking more and more about marketing,"
43:10;43:12;"specifically the Frito-Lay Corporation,"
43:12;43:14;"so we're very excited to talk to you."
43:14;43:16;"- Okay. - So before we start talking"
43:16;43:19;"Frito-Lay, we also just like to know about people's lives."
43:19;43:21;"- Yeah. - So can you give us"
43:21;43:24;"kind of a synopsis, 'cause obviously"
43:24;43:26;"you weren't born chief marketing officer"
43:26;43:28;"of Frito-Lay Corporation,"
43:28;43:30;"so can you give us a little bit of your backstory,"
43:30;43:32;"where you're from, your career path?"
43:32;43:34;"Take us back to the beginning."
43:34;43:37;"- Absolutely, so I actually grew up split"
43:37;43:40;"between upstate New York and a little, little, tiny place"
43:40;43:42;"called the Thousand Islands."
43:42;43:45;"It's literally 10,000 little islands"
43:45;43:47;"on the St. Lawrence River."
43:47;43:49;"Went to college at Emory University."
43:49;43:51;"I loved art and art history,"
43:51;43:53;"so I studied art and art history,"
43:53;43:56;"studied in Italy, but then I also knew"
43:56;43:58;"I needed to do something practical,"
43:58;44:00;"so I also studied finance."
44:00;44:02;"- Double major? - Double major."
44:02;44:04;"Art history and finance, which is not one"
44:04;44:06;"that you come across very often, I would say."
44:06;44:08;"- No. - And then I found marketing"
44:08;44:11;"as just an awesome blend of art and creativity"
44:11;44:15;"and imagination, but also really great business savvy,"
44:15;44:18;"and I started my job at Frito-Lay"
44:18;44:21;"actually as an intern between my first and second year."
44:21;44:23;"- So in your career at Frito-Lay,"
44:23;44:25;"you went from intern to chief marketing officer."
44:25;44:27;"How long did that take?"
44:27;44:30;"- It took me 11 years. - That's not a lot of time."
44:30;44:32;"- Wow. - It's not a lot of time."
44:32;44:34;"- It's not quite Obama, state senator to president"
44:34;44:36;"in, what, seven years?"
44:36;44:39;"But it's close. - It's close."
44:39;44:41;"- How old are you, if you don't mind us asking?"
44:41;44:43;"- So I am--that's a great question."
44:43;44:45;"I don't think about it very often. I'm 38."
44:45;44:48;"- So you're 38. You're right in between Jake and I."
44:48;44:50;"That's very young to be the chief marketing officer"
44:50;44:52;"of a huge company like that, no?"
44:52;44:54;"- I think it is. I don't know what kind of average age"
44:54;44:56;"of a CMO is, but I think it is."
44:56;44:58;"I think it's on the younger side."
44:58;45:01;"- So one thing that we always talk about on the show"
45:01;45:06;"is the ways in which kind of attitudes towards branding"
45:06;45:09;"and snack foods have changed so much generationally."
45:09;45:11;"Even, like, we talk about in our own lives,"
45:11;45:14;"you know, you used to roll up to a kid's house,"
45:14;45:17;"it's a big old snack drawer filled with things"
45:17;45:22;"that a lot of parents today would be disgusted by."
45:22;45:24;"So it's interesting, I think, 'cause, you know,"
45:24;45:27;"you're about our age, that for you to be coming into a company"
45:27;45:30;"that's so associated with the old world of snacking--"
45:30;45:32;"I'm interested in this, like, innovation thing."
45:32;45:36;"So when you came to Frito-Lay, what did the future look like?"
45:36;45:38;"Were people starting to get nervous, you know,"
45:38;45:41;"when things like potato chips are being increasingly associated"
45:41;45:43;"with, like, an old way of eating?"
45:43;45:45;"What was, like, the landscape like for you?"
45:45;45:47;"- So from a portfolio standpoint, you know,"
45:47;45:50;"we've always tried to look at our portfolio"
45:50;45:52;"and just understand a couple of things."
45:52;45:55;"One, what do consumers want to be snacking on?"
45:55;45:58;"What do they love about snacking? What are they looking for?"
45:58;46:02;"And we try to make sure that we have just a portfolio of options"
46:02;46:03;"that fill that."
46:03;46:07;"When you think about Frito-Lay, you think about those core brands"
46:07;46:11;"that we're known for-- Lay's, Doritos, Fritos, Ruffles."
46:11;46:13;"Those are brands that people think about."
46:13;46:17;"But we have just a massive portfolio of options."
46:17;46:19;"- Can we ask you about a few specific brands?"
46:19;46:20;"- Sure."
46:20;46:22;"- So kind of our fascination with Frito-Lay--"
46:22;46:24;"I don't know if you remember this, Jake--"
46:24;46:27;"it all began with a tweet that I saw,"
46:27;46:30;"but it was a kid making a joke that when you buy"
46:30;46:32;"the Frito-Lay variety pack,"
46:32;46:37;"what you're left with at the end is invariably the Fritos."
46:37;46:39;"So then we were talking that maybe Fritos"
46:39;46:42;"is an older person's snack, and then we actually started"
46:42;46:44;"reading more and more about Fritos, and we heard that actually"
46:44;46:47;"Fritos gets very little marketing because it's almost like"
46:47;46:48;"a heritage brand."
46:48;46:51;"So we're very curious about, like, where do you see Fritos"
46:51;46:54;"specifically in today's marketplace,"
46:54;46:56;"especially with regard to Doritos?"
46:56;46:58;"- The Fritos brand is a great brand."
46:58;47:01;"If you actually think about the company and who we are,"
47:01;47:03;"our company name is Frito-Lay."
47:03;47:04;"It's our namesake."
47:04;47:07;"And actually the very first product in our portfolio,"
47:07;47:09;"if you go way back, was Fritos."
47:09;47:11;"I think it was 1932."
47:11;47:15;"Fritos was started by Elmer Doolin in San Antonio, Texas."
47:15;47:19;"He was actually a confectioner, so he had candy shops,"
47:19;47:22;"and he was looking for something to supplement on the counter"
47:22;47:25;"what could they sell, and he started selling Fritos,"
47:25;47:27;"and then his wife was developing all these recipes."
47:27;47:31;"She was marketing them, and it actually grew in popularity,"
47:31;47:34;"and he sold them out of the back of his Model T."
47:34;47:38;"So when you think about heritage, I would say, yeah, absolutely."
47:38;47:40;"It is one of our heritage brands."
47:40;47:41;"It's our namesake."
47:41;47:44;"As a brand, you know, it's always been really unique,"
47:44;47:46;"and it's always been part of Americana."
47:46;47:47;"You're right."
47:47;47:50;"We don't do a lot of activity with Fritos."
47:50;47:55;"It's always been a business that actually doesn't need much to grow,"
47:55;47:57;"and consumers love it."
47:57;47:59;"So we don't talk about it as much."
47:59;48:02;"If you contrast that with something like a Doritos,"
48:02;48:04;"Doritos is another brand that people love,"
48:04;48:07;"but it's positioned a bit differently than Fritos."
48:07;48:10;"It's positioned a bit more cutting edge,"
48:10;48:15;"definitely got a bold positioning that forces us to think deeply"
48:15;48:19;"about how to reinvent and engage consumers who are looking for"
48:19;48:21;"what is that next thing."
48:21;48:25;"Right, because it feels like every few months there's some new type of Doritos,"
48:25;48:28;"whereas Fritos is very stable."
48:28;48:30;"It's loved just the way it is, and it's funny."
48:30;48:34;"If you try to do a lot with a Fritos, it's a thicker--if you eat it,"
48:34;48:36;"just do a side-by-side."
48:36;48:39;"It's a really thick, heavy corn flavor."
48:39;48:42;"We do some flavors with it, but the flavors on a Fritos"
48:42;48:46;"usually have to be pretty intense to have the flavor come through"
48:46;48:48;"from a carrier standpoint."
48:48;48:51;"This is super nerdy, like snack talk stuff,"
48:51;48:56;"but if you think about the bases on a chip--so think about a potato chip"
48:56;48:58;"and think about what a potato does."
48:58;49:00;"This is super nerdy."
49:00;49:03;"A potato in itself, because it's all starch,"
49:03;49:05;"dissolves just in your mouth."
49:05;49:08;"It melts away, and what you're left with is just the flavor."
49:08;49:13;"So there's not a lot that competes on a potato chip with the flavor"
49:13;49:15;"that you're trying to have come through in the seasoning."
49:15;49:18;"That's why when we do programs like Do Us a Flavor,"
49:18;49:21;"if you guys are familiar with that, we can do these really wacky,"
49:21;49:24;"almost Willy Wonka-esque flavors."
49:24;49:26;"Oh, when you come up with your own frilets."
49:26;49:28;"Right, yeah."
49:43;49:47;"Because of the profile of a potato chip and the way you eat it,"
49:47;49:51;"versus corn has a really unique flavor to it."
49:51;49:54;"And when you do heavy corn, like in a Fritos,"
49:54;49:58;"that's a pretty heavy flavor that you have to overcome with seasoning."
49:58;50:01;"So just the nature of the products and the flexibility"
50:01;50:04;"for what you can do with it determine a little bit"
50:04;50:06;"of the direction of where the brands can go."
50:06;50:10;"Right, so Fritos is somewhat limited in the directions you can take it,"
50:10;50:11;"almost on a chemical level."
50:11;50:12;"Yeah, and you know what?"
50:12;50:14;"It's an awesome product as is."
50:14;50:19;"The characteristics that it has, that hearty corn crunch that you can do,"
50:19;50:22;"it's actually a really great base to cook with,"
50:22;50:25;"which is why people do a lot of things like Frito pie and the popularity"
50:25;50:30;"of using it in recipes because of that heavy structure."
50:30;50:32;"You can't do that with some of our other brands"
50:32;50:34;"because they're just not made that way."
50:34;50:37;"So you kind of need to know what's the sweet spot of the product,"
50:37;50:39;"what's that product truth that comes through"
50:39;50:41;"and the experience for the consumer,"
50:41;50:45;"and then make sure that you're growing it in line with those expectations."
50:45;50:49;"If we try to make a Fritos perform like a Blaze or Doritos"
50:49;50:52;"or something like that from just a delivery,"
50:52;50:54;"people would be a little bit disappointed."
50:54;50:57;"Right, and so since these products are so different, and as you said,"
50:57;51:01;"you have to position them differently, do you associate a type of consumer?"
51:01;51:05;"Like you see a guy on the street, you see the type of hat he's wearing,"
51:05;51:07;"you're like, ""That's a Fritos, man."""
51:07;51:10;"Or you see a kid rolling up on a skateboard all wearing Supreme,"
51:10;51:12;"you're like, ""That's a Doritos guy."""
51:12;51:17;"Is there a classical consumer for each product, or how do you think about it?"
51:17;51:20;"What we try to think about is just what is the psychographic,"
51:20;51:22;"kind of like what's the mindset of these individuals."
51:22;51:27;"The demographics that you talk about, hey, it's an age, it's a male or a female,"
51:27;51:30;"certain things where we feel like we can categorize people,"
51:30;51:33;"it's a demographic statistic almost."
51:33;51:35;"A psychographic is a little bit more mindset-based."
51:35;51:37;"It's attitudinal."
51:37;51:39;"So is this person optimistic?"
51:39;51:41;"Are they joyful?"
51:41;51:44;"Do they think and believe certain values?"
51:44;51:48;"That's actually what we associate our brands with more is we try to think about"
51:48;51:50;"the psychographics that appeal to people."
51:50;51:56;"So in the example that you talk about with Doritos, it's a really bold brand."
51:56;51:58;"The product itself is bold."
51:58;52:01;"It's tooth-rattling, bold crunch, bold flavor."
52:01;52:07;"And the consumers who are drawn to Doritos, the people who love that brand,"
52:07;52:11;"are typically fairly bold in their action and their beliefs and the way they live"
52:11;52:13;"and the interests that they have."
52:13;52:18;"They tend to be a bit bolder, and that boldness exists across all age groups."
52:18;52:20;"Does it have a tendency to be younger?"
52:20;52:25;"The answer is yes, there's certainly a tendency for things to go a certain way."
52:25;52:29;"But we really try to think more about what is that mindset and belief"
52:29;52:32;"and play to that with all of our marketing."
52:32;52:36;"Which brand in the portfolio do you think is the most optimistic?"
52:36;52:41;"Like which corresponds to the optimistic psychographic subset?"
52:41;52:44;"We often think that Lays is really that optimistic."
52:44;52:46;"Think about the logo of Lays."
52:46;52:49;"It's sunny and it's bright and it's colorful."
52:49;52:51;"It's pretty optimistic."
52:51;52:56;"And even the associations of the occasions that people have are pretty happy occasions."
52:56;53:00;"They'll think about backyard barbecues and days at the beach."
53:00;53:05;"And there's usually a sense of kind of joyfulness that comes out of those occasions."
53:05;53:08;"So that's one that we think is pretty optimistic."
53:08;53:12;"So then I've got to ask, which is the most pessimistic?"
53:12;53:15;"Oh, pessimistic. There's nothing bad about snacking."
53:15;53:17;"It's all happy."
53:17;53:19;"I don't think we have a pessimistic brand in the bunch."
53:19;53:23;"Maybe the late-night cheeseburger Dorito?"
53:23;53:26;"No, there's nothing pessimistic about that."
53:26;53:29;"The night's just getting started. You need fuel."
53:29;53:31;"Fourth of hell."
53:31;53:32;"That's right."
53:32;53:35;"We might as well, if we're pouring something,"
53:35;53:40;"we ought to try to get a little nutrition in our bodies as well here tonight."
53:40;53:43;"I'm smelling those grilled sausages from outside the park on Yaki Way."
53:43;53:45;"I don't know. I don't know."
53:45;53:48;"Grilled sausage, cheeseburger, grilled sausage, cheeseburger."
53:48;53:51;"Cheeseburger, cheeseburger."
53:51;53:53;"[cheers and applause]"
53:53;53:58;"We noticed recently that Fritos chose Garth Brooks as a collaborative spokesman,"
53:58;54:01;"and you guys were giving out a free--"
54:01;54:04;"it was a free Garth Brooks song that you got a download code on the Fritos."
54:04;54:05;"Yeah."
54:05;54:07;"So I'm just kind of curious about how that came about,"
54:07;54:11;"the ways in which you felt like Garth was an appropriate choice for Fritos"
54:11;54:14;"versus any other brand you could have paired him with."
54:14;54:19;"Absolutely. That was just--I mean, such a fun program that we're doing with Garth."
54:19;54:24;"He's just an amazingly collaborative person, very kind, very generous with his time."
54:24;54:29;"So I don't have enough good things to say about Garth Brooks as an individual."
54:29;54:33;"So when we thought about the partnership and the opportunity to partner with Garth,"
54:33;54:37;"there was a couple of things about it that were just really impressive to us."
54:37;54:43;"One, he had never given out a single before in any of his music."
54:43;54:46;"He's never actually allowed the release of a single."
54:46;54:51;"He's the single highest-selling album artist of all time in the United States,"
54:51;54:53;"like bigger than anybody that you've seen."
54:53;54:57;"He's got seven Diamond Awards. It's really, truly amazing."
54:57;55:00;"But he had never released a single to the public for download."
55:00;55:06;"And when we were talking about this partnership, we said, ""Hey, could we release a single?"""
55:06;55:10;"He's like, ""Okay, let's do it."" So he released a single with us."
55:10;55:14;"And a couple of the things when we thought about him as a partner,"
55:14;55:17;"it goes back to some of those brand values that we had talked about earlier,"
55:17;55:21;"like what makes a brand really unique and special in consumers' minds."
55:21;55:24;"What does it stand for? The boldness of Doritos."
55:24;55:29;"Well, for Fritos, it's really being authentic, being genuine."
55:29;55:35;"That sense of Americana and heritage is actually part of the DNA of the Fritos brand."
55:35;55:38;"And when you think about someone like Garth Brooks,"
55:38;55:43;"he's very similar from a personality standpoint as Fritos."
55:43;55:48;"Super genuine, really authentic, like a kind of traditional American soul."
55:48;55:52;"And of course it helps that he actually personally loves Fritos."
55:52;55:56;"He eats them, and his wife, Trisha Yearwood, she cooks with Fritos,"
55:56;55:58;"and they talk about Fritos pie and stuff."
55:58;56:04;"So one, they're brand lovers, and it was a really natural fit from a narrative standpoint."
56:04;56:09;"It makes a lot of sense. We heard that you're going to see Adele tonight. Is that true?"
56:09;56:10;"I am."
56:10;56:14;"So maybe--I thought it might be fun just to try to do a little lightning round."
56:14;56:15;"I'm just curious."
56:15;56:16;"All right."
56:16;56:20;"If after the show tonight, a security guard comes over and says,"
56:20;56:23;"""Jennifer, we heard you're the CMO of Frito-Lay's."
56:23;56:24;"Adele would like to speak with you."""
56:24;56:29;"And she says, ""Jennifer, which brand in your portfolio can I work with?"""
56:29;56:31;"What's the first thing that comes to mind for you?"
56:31;56:34;"Adele, what she represents, which brand would she pair with?"
56:34;56:36;"Stacy's Pita Chips."
56:36;56:38;"Okay, interesting. I didn't know that was in your portfolio."
56:38;56:44;"How about this? If you think of Cool Ranch Doritos, what would be the ideal band to match that?"
56:44;56:45;"The dream partnership."
56:45;56:48;"For me personally--oh, man, I'm so uncool."
56:48;56:51;"Doritos, Cool Ranch, I'd probably go with something reggae, actually."
56:51;56:54;"Oh, okay. I see that."
56:54;56:56;"Something kind of chill. It's Cool Ranch."
56:56;56:58;"It's a little bit of the chill version of bold."
56:58;57:00;"It's got some attitude. It's got some swagger."
57:00;57:01;"Like that?"
57:01;57:03;"Maybe UB40?"
57:03;57:05;"Yeah, it could be UB40."
57:05;57:11;"It's maybe a little dated for our younger audience, but yeah, I'll go with that."
57:11;57:13;"Yeah, maybe more younger dancehall."
57:13;57:15;"Okay, one more."
57:15;57:17;"Yeah, the younger version of UB40, whatever that is."
57:17;57:18;"Right, so one more."
57:18;57:19;"Bieber."
57:19;57:20;"Oh, Bieber."
57:20;57:22;"Bieber's the younger version of UB40."
57:22;57:25;"We've been talking about it. He's had some Caribbean vibes in his music lately."
57:34;57:36;"Okay, so one more."
57:36;57:42;"You get summoned to Calabasas, California to come to the West Kardashian estate."
57:42;57:43;"All right."
57:43;57:47;"Kim and Kanye are both there sitting on thrones, and they each say--"
57:47;57:49;"we each individually want to do a brand partnership."
57:49;57:52;"What are you thinking for Kanye? What are you thinking for Kim?"
57:52;57:56;"Oh, wow. So Kanye--I'm going to go Funyuns."
58:10;58:13;"Funyuns? That's surprising."
58:13;58:15;"I'm going to go Funyuns. Yeah."
58:15;58:18;"And for Kim, I'm going to go Ruffles. I'm going to go Ruffles."
58:18;58:19;"Classic."
58:19;58:20;"Yeah, I was thinking about Ruffles."
58:20;58:24;"When you mentioned Ruffles before, I kind of feel like, obviously,"
58:24;58:27;"the name of the company, Frito-Lay's, you're putting those two forward."
58:27;58:29;"Doritos is such a famous one."
58:29;58:32;"Ruffles, I feel like, might get a little lost in the sauce."
58:32;58:35;"So how do you see the connection between Kim Kardashian and Ruffles?"
58:35;58:38;"Ruffles, it's got a sense of boldness to it too,"
58:38;58:42;"but also a little bit of classic, a little bit of bold, both mixed together."
58:42;58:45;"One of the things that people love about it is it's got a lot of flavor,"
58:45;58:47;"and I think she's got a lot of flavor."
58:47;58:50;"She's got a lot of personality, so that's the connection for me."
58:50;59:07;"Yeah, that's true."
59:07;59:11;"If I was at a party and they had a bowl of just classic lays and classic Ruffles,"
59:11;59:13;"I'm going Ruffles."
59:13;59:14;"Every time."
59:14;59:16;"Every time. It wouldn't even cross my mind."
59:16;59:18;"I see the texture."
59:18;59:20;"I'm a Ruffles guy, the more I think about it."
59:20;59:23;"And yet, I feel like I live in a lays world."
59:23;59:25;"You know, I feel like I'm around lays more."
59:25;59:26;"I might just hang out with the wrong people."
59:26;59:28;"I feel like lays is the biggest selling brand you have, right?"
59:28;59:29;"Is that right?"
59:29;59:33;"Lays is the number one food brand in the universe, basically."
59:33;59:37;"So in the world, it's the number one food brand in the world."
59:37;59:38;"Oh, my God."
59:38;59:40;"Where's lays big outside of the States?"
59:40;59:44;"Mexico is pretty big, but they call it Tabariza in Mexico."
59:44;59:48;"So it goes under different brands, but the trademark is all the same."
59:48;59:52;"It's the product itself, but it's Tabariza in Mexico."
59:52;59:54;"It's Walker's in the U.K."
59:54;59:55;"Oh, right."
59:55;01:00:01;"It's in Australia, but it's all the same brand and business linked together."
01:00:01;01:00:02;"Wow, that's amazing."
01:00:02;01:00:03;"It's a big one."
01:00:03;01:00:05;"So we should talk a little bit about--first of all,"
01:00:05;01:00:10;"you've gotten some amazing shout-outs in your brief eight months."
01:00:10;01:00:15;"Forbes says that what Doritos has been doing lately is nothing short of, well,"
01:00:15;01:00:18;"marketing genius, and they talked about some of the ways the snack has been"
01:00:18;01:00:21;"grabbing consumers' attention this year, and the big one was the kind of"
01:00:21;01:00:26;"Doritos political tie-in that you guys partnered with Rock the Vote to try to"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"encourage younger people to go to the polls."
01:00:28;01:00:31;"Why did you choose Doritos to be paired with Rock the Vote,"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"and were you nervous?"
01:00:33;01:00:38;"I know, obviously, Doritos is not coming out in favor of any political candidates,"
01:00:38;01:00:39;"I think."
01:00:39;01:00:43;"But it's unusual for a corporation to encourage civic engagement."
01:00:43;01:00:44;"It's interesting."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"Yeah, so how did that--what was the thought process?"
01:00:46;01:00:50;"We're nonpartisan, but we certainly want people to engage,"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"engage in their world, engage in discussion."
01:00:52;01:00:57;"So the narrative on Doritos that we try to encourage people is there's nothing"
01:00:57;01:01:03;"bolder than being yourself, and part of being yourself is expressing yourself."
01:01:03;01:01:07;"And what we were trying to show people with the campaign,"
01:01:07;01:01:13;"we refer to it as no choice, is that voting and registering to vote is really"
01:01:13;01:01:17;"about expressing and being part of a decision process."
01:01:17;01:01:22;"And what no choice was is we installed vending machines in college campuses"
01:01:22;01:01:27;"and in partnership with Rock the Vote, and these vending machines would take you"
01:01:27;01:01:30;"through a touch screen panel, you could select the chip that you were looking"
01:01:30;01:01:35;"for, whether it was nacho cheese or Cool Ranch, but the very first question that"
01:01:35;01:01:38;"it asked you was, ""Are you registered to vote?"""
01:01:38;01:01:41;"And if you answered no, you would still go through the touchpad panel,"
01:01:41;01:01:44;"select the flavor that you want, but instead of dispensing the chip that you"
01:01:44;01:01:49;"chose, you would get this gray bag of no choice chips that was filled with"
01:01:49;01:01:53;"cardboard chips inside, nothing very tasty at all, because if you're not"
01:01:53;01:01:56;"registered to vote, you can't make a choice, just like in--"
01:01:56;01:01:57;"Wow."
01:01:57;01:02:02;"So you literally created a metaphorical vending machine."
01:02:02;01:02:03;"Yep."
01:02:03;01:02:06;"So the kids, presumably, maybe the word spread, but they didn't know it first,"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"so you'd say, ""I didn't register to vote."""
01:02:08;01:02:10;"No, they didn't know it first, and they would do this."
01:02:10;01:02:14;"They would get the no chips, and they basically--to bring to life for them"
01:02:14;01:02:16;"that if you're not registered to vote, you can't make a choice."
01:02:16;01:02:20;"Someone else will choose for you, just like we did in that situation."
01:02:20;01:02:23;"I love the concept, although I've got to say the first thing that I'm thinking of"
01:02:23;01:02:28;"as somebody who also has my own corporation and has been sued, when I think"
01:02:28;01:02:32;"about that, I imagine legal being like, ""We can't have some stoner college kid"
01:02:32;01:02:35;"eating the cardboard chips."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"That's a lawsuit."" Was there any fear about that?"
01:02:37;01:02:40;"No one was harmed in the consumption of cardboard chips."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"They're not going to hurt you in any way."
01:02:42;01:02:45;"They're certainly not going to taste very good, but if anybody consumed"
01:02:45;01:02:49;"the cardboard chips, it would probably--they'd be all right from a consumption"
01:02:49;01:02:54;"standpoint, but we would definitely encourage them to eat our steel chips instead."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"That sounds like a great campaign, and I love that you guys are encouraging"
01:02:56;01:02:57;"people to vote."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"Thanks so much, Jennifer."
01:02:58;01:03:01;"This really has been fascinating, and thanks for taking the time to talk to us."
01:03:01;01:03:05;"Everybody, Jennifer Sines, check her out."
01:03:05;01:03:08;"The company is called Frito-Lay's North America."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"Look them up."
01:03:09;01:03:12;"Check out the portfolio, and enjoy the Adele concert tonight, Jennifer."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"Awesome. Thanks, guys. It was fun."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"Thanks so much. Have a good one."
01:03:15;01:03:16;"All right. Bye-bye."
01:03:16;01:03:17;"Bye."
01:06:45;01:06:53;"Wow, Jay, can you believe we just had the chief marketing officer,"
01:06:53;01:06:56;"Jennifer Sines, of Frito-Lay North America?"
01:06:56;01:06:57;"That was awesome."
01:06:57;01:07:01;"I think the all-time craziest guest we've had on this show--"
01:07:01;01:07:04;"It used to be the biggest guest we ever had was Jamie Foxx."
01:07:04;01:07:05;"Yeah."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"He definitely just got bumped down to number two."
01:07:07;01:07:08;"Big time."
01:07:08;01:07:12;"I've never actually gotten to talk that candidly with a chief marketing officer."
01:07:12;01:07:15;"I don't think I've ever even spoken to a chief marketing officer."
01:07:15;01:07:19;"I guess there's marketing in the music industry, but it's so different."
01:07:19;01:07:22;"There's not a chief marketing officer."
01:07:22;01:07:25;"This was such a historic occasion for Time Crisis,"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"I think we've got to do a quick post-mortem."
01:07:27;01:07:29;"Okay, things that jumped out to me--"
01:07:29;01:07:33;"psychographics, obviously I've never heard that phrase before."
01:07:33;01:07:37;"So as opposed to a demographic, a psychographic is--"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"like she said, a personality type?"
01:07:39;01:07:41;"It's a personality type that--"
01:07:41;01:07:44;"Or just, you know, she threw out optimistic."
01:07:44;01:07:49;"It's a mindset that transcends race, age, and gender."
01:07:49;01:07:53;"They don't want to limit themselves and be like, ""Doritos are for 14-year-olds."""
01:07:53;01:07:58;"They're saying Doritos are for bold people, whether you're 14, 25, 95."
01:07:58;01:07:59;"Right."
01:07:59;01:08:00;"So that's an interesting phrase."
01:08:00;01:08:03;"She was a big fan of the word ""bold."""
01:08:03;01:08:05;"Specifically with regard to Doritos."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"Yeah."
01:08:06;01:08:10;"I was trying to find maybe a gentle way to sort of push back"
01:08:10;01:08:13;"on the use of the word ""bold"" to describe people that eat Doritos."
01:08:13;01:08:14;"I thought that was--"
01:08:14;01:08:15;"Why, you don't agree?"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"No, I don't agree."
01:08:17;01:08:18;"What do you mean?"
01:08:18;01:08:22;"It was a generous characterization of the Dorito-eating public."
01:08:22;01:08:27;"Well, I know what you're saying, because to you, being bold is--"
01:08:27;01:08:31;"Well, look, her job is that she works in selling snack food."
01:08:31;01:08:32;"No, I get it."
01:08:32;01:08:34;"I guess she's not saying--"
01:08:34;01:08:41;"I'm sure Jennifer would not say that it's more bold to eat a bag of Doritos"
01:08:41;01:08:45;"than it is to protest the pipeline in North Dakota."
01:08:45;01:08:47;"She's not taking it there."
01:08:47;01:08:49;"They've got to look for correlations."
01:08:49;01:08:50;"Right."
01:08:50;01:08:52;"She's saying in the spectrum of snack food eating,"
01:08:52;01:08:56;"which is inherently a not very bold activity."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"Okay, okay."
01:08:57;01:08:59;"She's saying, ""No, no, no, I'm not throwing shade here."""
01:08:59;01:09:00;"Yeah, okay."
01:09:00;01:09:02;"I think we can all acknowledge that eating snack foods--"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"Is not a bold activity on the spectrum of activities?"
01:09:04;01:09:05;"Right."
01:09:05;01:09:06;"That's in the middle."
01:09:06;01:09:10;"But in that spectrum, she would say that Doritos are a bold choice."
01:09:10;01:09:12;"And I would agree with that."
01:09:12;01:09:17;"So it's like if you're going to go Grover Washington Jr. or Kenny G"
01:09:17;01:09:20;"in the spectrum of smooth jazz, you're going to go Grover."
01:09:20;01:09:21;"That's a bold choice."
01:09:21;01:09:22;"Right."
01:09:22;01:09:24;"If you're going to listen to Kanye instead of Drake,"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"well, I guess you're going to eat Funyuns."
01:09:26;01:09:27;"Right."
01:09:27;01:09:29;"Or maybe Doritos."
01:09:29;01:09:32;"The one other question that I had is personally--"
01:09:32;01:09:34;"and maybe this is just my own bias--"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"if I became CEO of Frito-Lay,"
01:09:36;01:09:41;"the first thing I would change the name to would be Dorito Core of America"
01:09:41;01:09:48;"because obviously, as she said, they have a wide portfolio of snack brands."
01:09:48;01:09:51;"By the way, I love having a portfolio of snack brands."
01:09:51;01:09:54;"I can only hope that by the time I pass from this earth,"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"I also have a portfolio of snack brands."
01:09:56;01:09:59;"Maybe not at the level of Frito-Lay, just like two or three."
01:09:59;01:10:02;"Kind of like a Paul Newman thing, Newman's Own?"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"Yeah, except the money wouldn't go to charity."
01:10:04;01:10:05;"It would just go to you."
01:10:05;01:10:08;"No, it would go--yeah, no, it would have to go to charity."
01:10:08;01:10:11;"Go directly to the military industrial complex."
01:10:11;01:10:15;"I would love to have just three brands that I can leave to my three children."
01:10:15;01:10:16;"The Pita Chips."
01:10:16;01:10:17;"Right."
01:10:17;01:10:19;"I leave to my daughter, Stacy."
01:10:19;01:10:22;"But anyway, I'm saying if I was the CEO of Frito-Lay,"
01:10:22;01:10:26;"there is something about--I didn't know that Lay's was the biggest brand in the world,"
01:10:26;01:10:31;"but I just feel like Frito-Lay, it sends this old-fashioned image of the company."
01:10:31;01:10:35;"I would want one of my Vanguard bold brands, such as Dorito's,"
01:10:35;01:10:36;"to be the face of the company."
01:10:36;01:10:37;"Right, flagship."
01:10:37;01:10:38;"Yeah, exactly."
01:10:38;01:10:42;"So it's like I wouldn't jettison Frito and Lay's,"
01:10:42;01:10:46;"but I would want the company to be like, ""I work at Dorito Core."""
01:10:46;01:10:47;"Yeah."
01:10:47;01:10:52;"Dorito Core has a great portfolio of other brands, but it's Dorito Core, cutting edge."
01:10:52;01:10:53;"That would be weird."
01:10:53;01:10:56;"In like 20 years, if Frito's is no longer a big seller,"
01:10:56;01:10:59;"but it's still the name of the company."
01:10:59;01:11:02;"Yeah, then it's time to change to Dorito Core."
01:11:02;01:11:03;"Big time."
01:11:47;01:11:56;"All right, Jake, you ready to get into the top five?"
01:11:56;01:11:57;"Oh, yeah."
01:11:57;01:12:03;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:12:03;01:12:06;"This week on the top five, we're going to do a comparison top five."
01:12:06;01:12:07;"Love it."
01:12:07;01:12:11;"We're going to compare the current top five songs on iTunes"
01:12:11;01:12:15;"to the top five Billboard hits this week in 1964."
01:12:15;01:12:17;"Wow, that's the earliest we've gone."
01:12:17;01:12:18;"Yeah, we're going way back."
01:12:18;01:12:20;"Why are we going back to 1964?"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"Why do you think?"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"Well, one, it was an election year."
01:12:23;01:12:24;"Yeah."
01:12:24;01:12:27;"Was that Lyndon Johnson versus Barry Goldwater?"
01:12:27;01:12:28;"Was that Goldwater?"
01:12:28;01:12:29;"I think so."
01:12:29;01:12:30;"Yeah, that sounds right."
01:12:30;01:12:35;"But also, in our research, in our preparation for our interview,"
01:12:35;01:12:39;"we learned that 1964 was the year that Doritos came onto the market"
01:12:39;01:12:40;"for the first time."
01:12:40;01:12:41;"That's right."
01:12:41;01:12:46;"We're comparing 2016 to the birth year of Doritos, 1964."
01:12:46;01:12:49;"So let's go back to 1964."
01:12:49;01:12:53;"Number five song by Jerry Butler and Betty Everett, ""Let It Be Me."""
01:12:53;01:12:54;"That's a beautiful song."
01:12:54;01:12:56;"There's a lot of famous versions of it."
01:12:56;01:12:57;"I know the Everleys version."
01:12:57;01:13:00;"And it's based on a French song."
01:13:00;01:13:01;"Oh, really?"
01:13:01;01:13:02;"Yeah."
01:13:02;01:13:04;"[singing]"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"I forget what the French version is called."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"But yeah, the French version translated into English."
01:13:08;01:13:09;"Gorgeous song."
01:13:09;01:13:10;"""Let It Be Me."""
01:13:13;01:13:20;"I've lost the day I found you."
01:13:20;01:13:28;"So it's got that small-t, late '50s, early '60s, like pop palette."
01:13:28;01:13:31;"I wonder what the Everleys Brothers version was."
01:13:31;01:13:33;"Probably before this."
01:13:33;01:13:34;"Yeah, only a little bit."
01:13:36;01:13:42;"Don't take this heaven from one."
01:13:42;01:13:47;"If you must cling to someone."
01:13:47;01:13:52;"Now and forever."
01:13:52;01:13:54;"I mean, great song."
01:13:54;01:13:57;"Yeah, George Harrison covered that song."
01:13:57;01:13:58;"It's beautiful."
01:13:58;01:14:04;"Each time we meet, love."
01:14:04;01:14:09;"I find complete love."
01:14:09;01:14:15;"Oh, without your sweet love."
01:14:15;01:14:20;"What would life be?"
01:14:20;01:14:26;"So never leave me lonely."
01:14:26;01:14:29;"Tell me you love me."
01:14:29;01:14:32;"I like the pretty, simple songs from that era."
01:14:32;01:14:33;"Yeah."
01:14:33;01:14:34;"I bless the day I found you."
01:14:34;01:14:37;"I want to stay around you."
01:14:37;01:14:41;"Let it be me."
01:14:41;01:14:50;"It's a nice sentiment."
01:14:50;01:14:53;"Someone just bought a bag of this new product called Doritos."
01:14:53;01:14:54;"Yeah, can you picture that?"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"They're getting in their station wagon."
01:14:56;01:14:59;"Mom just got home from the grocery store."
01:14:59;01:15:02;"It's like, this is playing, just like--"
01:15:02;01:15:03;"Yeah."
01:15:03;01:15:09;"1964, I was eight years old in my neighborhood in Brooklyn."
01:15:09;01:15:12;"Mom came home from the grocery store."
01:15:12;01:15:19;"I saw a shiny bag sticking out top of the brown paper grocery sack."
01:15:19;01:15:21;"She pulled it out."
01:15:21;01:15:23;"It was a new product called Doritos."
01:15:23;01:15:24;"What's a tortilla chip?"
01:15:24;01:15:27;"Mom, what's a tortilla chip?"
01:15:27;01:15:32;"Little did I know that the course of my life and American history"
01:15:32;01:15:35;"will be forever altered by this product."
01:15:35;01:15:38;"Well, sweetie, it's a corn chip, not a potato chip."
01:15:38;01:15:43;"I remember as I bit in, the texture was like nothing I'd ever had before."
01:15:43;01:15:44;"Hell of a year."
01:15:44;01:15:45;"Side note on the Doritos."
01:15:45;01:15:46;"Yeah."
01:15:46;01:15:50;"I was reading about the inventor of Doritos, a man named Arch West."
01:15:50;01:15:51;"Bizarre name."
01:15:51;01:15:52;"Crazy name, right?"
01:15:52;01:15:55;"There's actually conflicting histories on the internet about how Doritos came to be."
01:15:55;01:15:58;"One was that he went to a Mexican restaurant in San Diego"
01:15:58;01:16:02;"and just had some corn chips with chili powder on it, and he loved it."
01:16:02;01:16:06;"The other story was that he was at a Mexican restaurant at Disneyland."
01:16:06;01:16:07;"Yeah."
01:16:07;01:16:09;"He was eating a similar product."
01:16:09;01:16:12;"Smash cut to the end of his life, he dies in 2011."
01:16:12;01:16:15;"Apparently, he's on his deathbed."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"Yeah."
01:16:16;01:16:18;"And he tries one of the new Dorito products,"
01:16:18;01:16:21;"which is the all-night cheeseburger Dorito,"
01:16:21;01:16:24;"and he takes one bite and he spits it out."
01:16:24;01:16:27;"He doesn't even recognize this crazy newfangled Dorito."
01:16:27;01:16:28;"Oh, my God."
01:16:28;01:16:30;"It's something that he was connected with."
01:16:30;01:16:33;"And then when he died, he was buried,"
01:16:33;01:16:36;"and his kin sprinkled Doritos on his coffin."
01:16:36;01:16:37;"Oh, my God."
01:16:37;01:16:38;"Isn't that crazy?"
01:16:38;01:16:41;"They sprinkled all-night cheeseburger Doritos on his coffin."
01:16:41;01:16:43;"Probably the classic nacho cheese."
01:16:43;01:16:44;"As a gag."
01:16:44;01:16:45;"Yeah, as a gag."
01:16:45;01:16:48;"I mean, I guess you could make the case that it's poetic justice."
01:16:48;01:16:52;"He stole this idea potentially from a Mexican restaurant,"
01:16:52;01:16:55;"and then on his deathbed, he's like, ""Bring me a Dorito,"""
01:16:55;01:16:58;"and he eats this thing, and he's like, ""I don't even recognize this anymore,"""
01:16:58;01:17:01;"and he dies."
01:17:01;01:17:04;"The number five song in 2016,"
01:17:04;01:17:07;"I know, Jake, I don't even want to talk about it."
01:17:07;01:17:11;"All my friends are heathens, take it slow."
01:17:11;01:17:13;"Really? It's still number five?"
01:17:13;01:17:16;"Wait for them to ask you who you know."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"I have pretty good pitch."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"Yeah, that's pretty good."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"You have the right--"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"We don't want to debate 21 Pilots anymore."
01:17:22;01:17:26;"I don't want to just, like, relentlessly harsh out 21 Pilots."
01:17:26;01:17:28;"That's the song of 2016, kind of."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"Kind of is."
01:17:29;01:17:30;"I mean, it's a fitting song."
01:17:30;01:17:33;"It's a dark year, and that's a dark song"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"from the Suicide Squad soundtrack."
01:17:35;01:17:37;"Okay, no 21 Pilots slander this time."
01:17:37;01:17:39;"I'm putting a follow on 21 Pilots slander."
01:17:39;01:17:41;"Let's go back to 1964."
01:17:41;01:17:42;"Now, this is a good song."
01:17:42;01:17:44;"It's from New York Girls."
01:17:44;01:17:45;"It's called ""The Leader of the Pack."""
01:17:45;01:17:47;"Oh, wow."
01:17:47;01:17:49;"Is she really going out with him?"

01:25:50;01:25:51;"Yeah."
01:25:51;01:25:53;"They choose who they're going to date"

01:25:55;01:25:57;"What's going to get me attention?"
01:25:57;01:25:59;"What's going to get people talking?"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"But you know what?"
01:26:01;01:26:04;"Everybody out there who's dating somebody who's married,"
01:26:04;01:26:07;"where did you meet that person?"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"Who's your significant other?"
01:26:09;01:26:13;"Is it a guy or gal from Chennai, India?"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"Or is it somebody from your community?"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"Somebody who lives nearby,"
01:26:17;01:26:20;"maybe works in a similar industry, similar interests?"
01:26:20;01:26:21;"7-Eleven."
01:26:21;01:26:23;"Yeah, maybe they work at your local 7-Eleven."
01:26:23;01:26:28;"Maybe you literally met them via an algorithm on Tinder."
01:26:28;01:26:30;"I don't think Hyden was throwing shade, really."
01:26:30;01:26:32;"No, I don't think he's throwing shade,"
01:26:32;01:26:34;"but he's proving that we like to believe"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"that love transcends all these things."
01:26:36;01:26:38;"But sometimes you get down to it,"
01:26:38;01:26:41;"and it's like people meet each other who work in similar industries,"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"who live in similar places."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"I don't know if it's a good or a bad thing."
01:26:45;01:26:47;"I have heard--"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"No, it makes complete sense."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"The only reason that it's a bad thing"
01:26:51;01:26:54;"is that I've heard that more than ever,"
01:26:54;01:26:58;"people from similar socioeconomic backgrounds"
01:26:58;01:27:00;"are getting married."
01:27:00;01:27:02;"Even though women are making more money"
01:27:02;01:27:06;"and attaining higher positions than they did, say, in the 1950s,"
01:27:06;01:27:09;"men and women who both, say, are at the executive level"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"in a corporation, they tend to marry each other,"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"which is great."
01:27:13;01:27:16;"If you're a Frito-Lay executive and you're having pillow talk"

01:27:18;01:27:21;"when you're talking about psychographics"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"and marketing and stuff."
01:27:23;01:27:26;"I get it, but at the same time,"
01:27:26;01:27:29;"we're dealing with a period of extreme wealth inequality."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"That money that you're making in the executive position,"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"you're marrying somebody--"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"Who's working at Kraft."
01:27:35;01:27:39;"Yeah. Now, the conversation is going to be off the hook, of course."
01:27:39;01:27:41;"And I can only imagine being a child in that household."
01:27:41;01:27:44;"But it does contribute to wealth inequality."
01:27:44;01:27:46;"But you can't tell people to marry--"
01:27:46;01:27:48;"I don't know. I guess-- You know what it is?"
01:27:48;01:27:50;"That's why we've got to just pay more taxes,"
01:27:50;01:27:52;"so that the executives can marry each other,"
01:27:52;01:27:54;"but they've still got to give money that's going to help people"
01:27:54;01:27:56;"who don't have the luxury of--"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"And the pop power couples."
01:27:58;01:28:01;"I mean, Drake and Taylor Swift, that's a lot of money."
01:28:01;01:28:04;"Now, if they each married a broke person,"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"at least two broke people would be less broke."
01:28:06;01:28:08;"Is it even true or is it just a rumor? We don't even know."
01:28:08;01:28:10;"We don't even know."
01:28:10;01:28:12;"Who cares?"
01:28:12;01:28:15;"We worry too much about celebrities anyway."
01:28:15;01:28:18;"Celebrity worship is how Donald Trump became president."
01:28:18;01:28:22;"Let's go back to a more complicated time, 1964."
01:28:22;01:28:24;"Manford Man was on the charts."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"Ooh."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"With a pretty goofy song, but a fun one."
01:28:27;01:28:29;"You remember this one?"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"Oh, yeah."
01:28:31;01:28:33;"# There she was"
01:28:33;01:28:36;"# Just a-walkin' down the street singing"
01:28:36;01:28:39;"# Do-wa-de-de-de-de-dum-de-de-dum"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"I forgot this was Manford Man,"
01:28:41;01:28:44;"'cause they went on to do that iconic cover of--"
01:28:44;01:28:46;"Of Britney. Yeah, ""By the, By the Light."""
01:28:46;01:28:48;"# She looked good"
01:28:48;01:28:49;"# She looked good"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"# She looked fine"
01:28:50;01:28:51;"# Looked fine"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"# She looked good, she looked fine"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"# And I nearly lost my mind"
01:28:55;01:28:56;"# Before I knew it"
01:28:56;01:28:57;"Love those maracas."
01:28:57;01:28:59;"# She was walkin' next to me singing"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"# Do-wa-de-de-de-de-dum"
01:29:01;01:29:02;"Real loud in the mix."
01:29:02;01:29:06;"So in 2016, the way that a pop star like Drake"
01:29:06;01:29:08;"finds a significant other"
01:29:08;01:29:11;"is by probably going to an exclusive club or party"
01:29:11;01:29:13;"with his elite superstar peers."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"That's how he meets them."
01:29:15;01:29:18;"But in 1964, a big musician like Manford Man,"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"he would meet women just walking down the street."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"He doesn't know if she works at 7-Eleven"
01:29:22;01:29:25;"or if she's, like, a chief marketing officer for 7-Eleven."
01:29:25;01:29:28;"He would just hear a girl singing,"
01:29:28;01:29:30;"go up to her, and chat."
01:29:30;01:29:32;"And you know, that is kind of how you build--"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"Very organic. It's very organic,"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"but also, when people are out on the street"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"singing, dancing, talking to each other,"
01:29:38;01:29:40;"which you don't see that much anymore,"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"that's how people from different backgrounds"
01:29:42;01:29:43;"can meet each other."
01:29:43;01:29:46;"Like, when you hear somebody singing,"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"you hear their voice first."
01:29:48;01:29:50;"It's a little bit like the show ""The Voice."""
01:29:50;01:29:54;"You don't know if they're sitting on a couple hundred mil"
01:29:54;01:29:55;"like Taylor Swift."
01:29:55;01:29:58;"You don't know if they've got $5 in their checking account."
01:29:58;01:30:00;"It's very pure. Very pure."
01:30:00;01:30:03;"But at the same time, 1964 was a very bad time, too."
01:30:03;01:30:06;"I'm just saying, in terms of pop stars dating,"
01:30:06;01:30:07;"it was a simpler time."

01:32:01;01:32:04;"Is he saying ""fingers"" or ""rings""?"
01:32:04;01:32:07;"""Put your pinky rings up to the moon""?"
01:32:07;01:32:10;"Man, you are so good at listening to the lyrics."
01:32:10;01:32:12;"Yeah, I'm a professional lyricist."
01:32:12;01:32:15;"You really zone in on that immediately."
01:32:15;01:32:19;"I listen to them in a much more, I don't know, spaced-out kind of--"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"You know me, I love my sonic palettes."
01:32:21;01:32:22;"Right."
01:32:22;01:32:24;"I've probably also heard--"
01:32:24;01:32:26;"I've heard this song probably more times than you."
01:32:26;01:32:27;"Yeah, this is only the second time I've heard it."
01:32:27;01:32:31;"So I'm just kind of listening to it in this kind of--"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"You're taking it all in holistically."
01:32:33;01:32:35;"Yeah, what are the dynamics and the feelings?"
01:32:35;01:32:38;"Yeah, 'cause sometimes you hear a song and you take it all in,"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"and then you're like, ""Let me look up the lyrics."""
01:32:40;01:32:41;"That's what it's about?"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"And then you're like, ""Ooh, I can't listen to this anymore."""
01:32:43;01:32:44;"Right."
01:32:44;01:32:46;"I was talking to my mom recently,"
01:32:46;01:32:49;"'cause she was never very interested in pop music."
01:32:49;01:32:54;"Her record collection leans very heavy on classical,"
01:32:54;01:32:57;"a little bit of folk, but not particularly interested."
01:32:57;01:33:01;"You know, I guess I was talking about the Bruce Springsteen book,"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"'cause I know my dad had a bunch of Bruce records,"
01:33:03;01:33:06;"and I was like, ""Mom, were you a Springsteen fan?"""
01:33:06;01:33:08;"You know, just growing up in New Jersey, New York."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"Like, ""Were you up on him?"""
01:33:10;01:33:12;"And she was like, ""Eh, I just wasn't interested in that type of music."""
01:33:12;01:33:14;"And she was going to check some of it out"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"to see if she'd be interested in the book,"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"and she was listening to some Born in the USA,"
01:33:18;01:33:20;"and she was like, ""It's so noisy."""
01:33:20;01:33:22;"And I was like, ""Eh, not wrong about that."
01:33:22;01:33:24;"That, like, loud '80s-- pfft, yeah."""
01:33:24;01:33:27;"But anyway, she said she's getting more interested in pop music now"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"because the lyrics are easily accessible."
01:33:29;01:33:31;"She likes to know what she's listening to."
01:33:31;01:33:35;"So now, if, you know, there's a Chainsmokers song on the radio,"
01:33:35;01:33:37;"she can look up the lyrics immediately."
01:33:37;01:33:39;"I mean, I tend to think back in the day,"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"if they didn't include the official lyrics with it,"
01:33:41;01:33:44;"you could sit there for hours wondering what it says."
01:33:44;01:33:46;"I think it's kind of cool that you can discuss the meaning"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"with other people very quickly,"
01:33:48;01:33:50;"and you can know exactly what somebody's saying."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"So is she getting into the Chainsmokers?"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"No, I don't think the Chainsmokers--"
01:33:54;01:33:57;"she just finds music with lyrics more interesting when she gets--"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"I think because, you know, she liked folk music,"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"where the lyrics are mostly what's there."
01:34:01;01:34:03;"And the diction is very clear."
01:34:03;01:34:05;"And the diction's very clear."
01:34:05;01:34:07;"A song like Bruno Mars, which is, like, so fun,"
01:34:07;01:34:10;"and there's so much going on, but it can occasionally be hard"
01:34:10;01:34:12;"to know exactly what he's saying. Now you can look it up."
01:34:12;01:34:15;"I feel like Bruce, though, a lot of the songs, you can follow it."
01:34:15;01:34:17;"Maybe--I don't know, maybe it's hard."
01:34:17;01:34:19;"Yeah, I mean, ""Born in the USA"" is a tough one."
01:34:19;01:34:21;"# I was out in a dead man's tent #"
01:34:21;01:34:22;"Yeah."
01:34:22;01:34:24;"Obviously, Ronald Reagan didn't know what he was saying."
01:34:24;01:34:26;"Let's go back to 1964."
01:34:26;01:34:28;"This is pretty wild, that on the same time"
01:34:28;01:34:30;"that ""Leader of the Pack"" was on the charts,"
01:34:30;01:34:33;"also about this kind of, like, disastrous, dangerous,"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"auto-vehicular romance,"
01:34:35;01:34:38;"this song was also on the charts."
01:34:38;01:34:40;"J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers."
01:34:40;01:34:43;"# #"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"Oh, this is another car accident one, right?"
01:34:45;01:34:46;"Yeah."
01:34:46;01:34:49;"# Well, where, oh, where can my baby be? #"
01:34:49;01:34:53;"Whoa, this song's, like, kind of, like, punky in a way."
01:34:53;01:34:55;"It's like... # Bum, bum, bum, bum #"
01:34:55;01:34:56;"Yeah."
01:34:56;01:34:58;"# So I got to be good #"
01:34:58;01:35:00;"Yeah, it's, like, really up-tempo."
01:35:00;01:35:02;"I listened to this song a lot as a kid."
01:35:02;01:35:04;"It's like a tape of, like, the greatest hits of 1964."
01:35:04;01:35:05;"Oh, really?"
01:35:05;01:35:08;"# We were out on a date in my daddy's car #"
01:35:08;01:35:10;"# We had a river #"
01:35:10;01:35:12;"I feel like this song kind of inspires,"
01:35:12;01:35:15;"or it would have been an inspiration for Springsteen, too."
01:35:15;01:35:16;"Oh, yeah."
01:35:16;01:35:17;"Like, that song..."
01:35:17;01:35:18;"The big drama of..."
01:35:18;01:35:20;"That song, ""Wreck on the Highway"","
01:35:20;01:35:22;"that last song on the river."
01:35:22;01:35:26;"# Never forget the sound that night #"
01:35:26;01:35:29;"Remember, like, ten years ago,"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"there was that Pearl Jam cover of this?"
01:35:31;01:35:32;"Yeah."
01:35:32;01:35:33;"It was, like, all over the radio."
01:35:33;01:35:35;"I remember thinking that was so random."
01:35:35;01:35:37;"Yeah, like, yeah, almost more like 20, yeah."
01:35:37;01:35:41;"# Well, where, oh, where can my baby be? #"
01:35:41;01:35:44;"# The Lord took her away from me #"
01:35:44;01:35:47;"# She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good #"
01:35:47;01:35:53;"# So I can see my baby when I leave this world #"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"What a spooky song."
01:35:55;01:35:58;"This is pretty... This is pretty... More of a Halloween song."
01:35:58;01:36:00;"You know what's funny? That's such a '60s sentiment."
01:36:00;01:36:02;"The chorus of the song is..."
01:36:02;01:36:04;"# Well, where, oh, where can my baby be? #"
01:36:04;01:36:06;"# The Lord took her away from me #"
01:36:06;01:36:08;"# She's gone to heaven #"
01:36:08;01:36:10;"# She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good #"
01:36:10;01:36:14;"# So I can see my baby when I leave this world #"
01:36:14;01:36:16;"It's a very undefiant sentiment."
01:36:16;01:36:19;"Now we associate, like, pop music is about, like,"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"""I'm the best,"" like, being powerful and stuff."
01:36:21;01:36:23;"This is literally..."
01:36:23;01:36:27;"The number two song on the charts in 1964 was about..."
01:36:27;01:36:29;"A guy gets in a car accident."
01:36:29;01:36:31;"It sounds like it's kind of his fault."
01:36:31;01:36:33;"And then the takeaway from it is..."
01:36:33;01:36:35;"# Well, where, oh, where can my baby be? #"
01:36:35;01:36:39;"""I guess the Lord needed to murder my girlfriend."""
01:36:39;01:36:42;"My main takeaway from this experience..."
01:36:42;01:36:44;"- Is that... - ""I got to be good."""
01:36:44;01:36:46;"Is that I got to be good."
01:36:46;01:36:48;"This definitely reaffirms my faith."
01:36:48;01:36:50;"HE CHUCKLES"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"I mean, shout-out to that guy,"
01:36:52;01:36:56;"cos a lot of people would stop believing in God"
01:36:56;01:36:59;"after being in a traumatic incident like that."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"A completely senseless way to die, yeah."
01:37:01;01:37:03;"I mean, I could see both sides of it."
01:37:03;01:37:05;"Or maybe you need God more than ever."
01:37:05;01:37:09;"But anyway, you don't hear that in pop songs that much these days."
01:37:09;01:37:11;"If something bad happened to you,"
01:37:11;01:37:15;"you'd probably write a song about stewing in the depression that followed,"
01:37:15;01:37:18;"versus this guy has a relatively upbeat attitude"
01:37:18;01:37:24;"for having killed his girlfriend in vehicular manslaughter."
01:37:25;01:37:27;"Wow."
01:37:27;01:37:30;"November '64, major election coming up."
01:37:30;01:37:33;"- JFK had just died, right? - Yeah."
01:37:33;01:37:36;"- A year prior. - Yeah, a year prior, JFK died."
01:37:36;01:37:39;"The President of the United States was murdered."
01:37:39;01:37:41;"And then two of the songs on the charts,"
01:37:41;01:37:44;"one from a female perspective, one from a male perspective,"
01:37:44;01:37:47;"about a significant other dying."
01:37:47;01:37:49;"- Tragically and suddenly. - Tragically."
01:37:49;01:37:51;"You know what's really crazy about that song?"
01:37:51;01:37:53;"I mean, I love that song. I do find it moving."
01:37:53;01:37:56;"And also, it's just describing a real thing."
01:37:56;01:37:59;"It seems so dramatic, like the rain pouring down."
01:37:59;01:38:02;"It's like people die in car accidents every day. It's horrific."

01:38:12;01:38:16;"The only thing that I find weird is that the girl smiles."
01:38:16;01:38:18;"- Yeah, that's very weird. - It's kind of like--"
01:38:18;01:38:22;"I guess that's supposed to illustrate just the intensity of their love."
01:38:22;01:38:24;"- Even though she's dying. - Oh, okay."
01:38:24;01:38:28;"- She's in his arms, and she's-- - Oh, that's a nice way to think about it."
01:38:28;01:38:32;"She can't help but smile, even though the end is near."

01:38:42;01:38:46;"- But in the Bruce song, it's the-- - He sees a wreck on the highway."
01:38:46;01:38:49;"He sees a wreck. He stops. There's a young man dying."
01:38:49;01:38:52;"- Yeah. - He witnesses this man's death, and then he goes home--"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"- And looks at his child. - No, his wife."
01:38:54;01:38:57;"- Oh, his wife. - He goes back and he gets into bed with his wife."
01:38:57;01:39:00;"And he just watches her sleeping in peace."
01:39:00;01:39:02;"- Oh, God. - And he's just sort of, like,"
01:39:02;01:39:05;"recognizing that life is finite."
01:39:05;01:39:08;"- Ooh. - Bruce took it to some other place."
01:39:08;01:39:10;"Car accidents. Ugh, man."
01:39:10;01:39:13;"Yeah, no, I like your interpretation that the smile was,"

01:39:30;01:39:33;"Yeah, I thought maybe the smile was more in, like,"
01:39:33;01:39:36;"the kind of-- the religious sentiment of the song."
01:39:36;01:39:39;"- Mm. - Just like, ""Oh, don't worry about me."

01:44:11;01:44:13;"Or just someone you haven't heard of."
01:44:13;01:44:16;"That was put forward very explicitly in the film."
01:44:16;01:44:18;"I remember feeling sort of like, ""Oh."""

01:44:27;01:44:29;"The sound of her voice appealed more to white people."

01:44:41;01:44:42;"Right."
01:44:42;01:44:45;"But I never thought about that before until I saw that movie."
