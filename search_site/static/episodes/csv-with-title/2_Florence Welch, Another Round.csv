00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis Episode 2. Wow, has it been two weeks already?"
00:04;00:07;"2015 just keeps getting more and more Time Crisis-y."
00:07;00:12;"I'm so glad that I have this outlet to talk about things and listen to music with my friends and enemies."
00:12;00:14;"This is a really beautiful show."
00:14;00:18;"We've got Despot, Cousin Asher, Tracy, and Heaven from Another Round Podcast,"
00:18;00:22;"Florence from Florence and the Machine, a music story from Rashida Jones,"
00:22;00:27;"and lots of great, beautiful music by wonderful people."
00:27;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
54:32;54:34;"What's up? This is Time Crisis with Ezra."
54:34;54:36;"Got some very special guests."
54:36;54:38;"We got Florence Welsh from Florence and the Machine."
54:38;54:40;"What's up? Nice to see you again."
54:40;54:42;"Thank you for having us."
54:42;54:43;"Thank you."
54:43;54:44;"We feel very privileged."
54:44;54:45;"And Florence has with her, Mireille."
54:45;54:46;"Hi."
54:46;54:47;"You guys work together?"
54:47;54:49;"I'm Florence's manager. I manage her with Hannah."
54:49;54:50;"Oh, it's the two of you?"
54:50;54:51;"Yeah."
54:51;54:52;"Okay."
54:52;54:53;"We're a power couple."
54:53;54:56;"And as always, got my main man, Alec aka Despot."
54:56;54:57;"Hi."
54:57;54:59;"One thing I was thinking of when I found out that you were going to come in,"
54:59;55:01;"I was trying to think about the first time I ever met you."
55:01;55:03;"Do you know the first time you ever met me?"
55:03;55:04;"I can't remember."
55:04;55:06;"I think it was at a festival though, wasn't it?"
55:06;55:08;"This might not even be the first time I met you,"
55:08;55:10;"but this is the first time ever I saw your face."
55:10;55:11;"Yeah."
55:11;55:12;"I think."
55:12;55:14;"And actually, I want you to tell me if this is true."
55:14;55:16;"I think it was at Reading/Leeds."
55:16;55:17;"Yes."
55:17;55:19;"2008, and you were hanging out with MGMT."
55:19;55:23;"When me and Andrew were sitting underneath your table that had your snacks on it"
55:23;55:25;"and shooting juice cartons through the paper."
55:25;55:27;"Okay, I didn't even know about that."
55:27;55:28;"[laughter]"
55:28;55:30;"Okay, so that was that summer?"
55:30;55:32;"I don't think, because we were hiding in your dressing room"
55:32;55:35;"and I think we were going to try and surprise you."
55:35;55:36;"We were hiding underneath your--"
55:36;55:38;"Surprise me or punk me?"
55:38;55:41;"I don't know, but I remember we were hiding underneath the table"
55:41;55:43;"that had all your dressing room snacks on it"
55:43;55:48;"and we were using my beanie cartons to shoot as weapons or something."
55:48;55:51;"And then we found some tires to play with."
55:51;55:53;"So this is 2000--"
55:53;55:55;"Were you guys messed up?"
55:55;55:56;"Yes."
55:56;55:58;"Okay, it's a festival, no shame in that."
55:58;56:00;"So this is 2008."
56:00;56:02;"Was Florence and the Machine a band then?"
56:02;56:03;"Yeah, we were, yeah."
56:03;56:04;"But you hadn't released an album."
56:04;56:09;"No, that was when my dad was tour managing us in the camper van"
56:09;56:14;"and we were supporting MGMT on their first European tour."
56:14;56:15;"Oh."
56:15;56:17;"And Reading was somewhere in the middle of that, but we had a small--"
56:17;56:19;"Oh, so you played. You weren't just hanging out."
56:19;56:21;"No, we did play. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we played."
56:21;56:23;"Yeah, I probably just didn't know about Florence and the Machine yet."
56:23;56:24;"Yeah."
56:24;56:25;"Because your first album came out in 2009."
56:25;56:27;"I think so, yeah."
56:27;56:29;"Maré, can we get a fact check on that?"
56:29;56:31;"The album was out in 2009, yeah."
56:31;56:32;"Knew it."

01:00:11;01:00:14;"- Okay, so this is 2008, leading up to your debut album."
01:00:14;01:00:16;"You're touring with MGMT, whose album was out."
01:00:16;01:00:17;"- Yeah."
01:00:17;01:00:18;"- Big fat hits at the time."
01:00:18;01:00:19;"- ""Riding High."""
01:00:20;01:00:21;"You know them, right, Alec?"
01:00:21;01:00:22;"- I know them well."
01:00:22;01:00:24;"- Yeah, ""Electric Feel"" era."
01:00:24;01:00:26;"I think that's the first time I saw you,"
01:00:26;01:00:27;"'cause I feel like there was somebody--"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"- Was I wearing a clown suit?"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"- I feel like you were wearing some kind of like--"
01:00:30;01:00:33;"- I've got some really weird Polaroids of me and Andrew"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"both like pushing tires that we'd found."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"- In clown suits."
01:00:36;01:00:38;"- Around, we were both in clown suits."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"- Did you have a different aesthetic back then?"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"Were you electro clash?"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"- It wasn't electro clash, it was just pretty much--"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"- Wait, wait, no, what do you call the clacks"
01:00:46;01:00:47;"on people call them?"
01:00:47;01:00:48;"- Oh, New Rave."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"- Oh, were you New Rave a little bit?"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"- No, I wasn't."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"Well, we weren't New Rave, no."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"It was much more about--"
01:00:55;01:00:57;"It was much more just like if someone gave us--"
01:00:57;01:01:00;"Well, we'd get paid for a gig, which would be like 10 pounds,"
01:01:00;01:01:03;"and then you would spend it on a charity shop dress"
01:01:03;01:01:04;"or something."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"- MGMT would only give you 10 pounds?"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"- Well, I think we got about--"
01:01:06;01:01:07;"How much money did we get?"
01:01:07;01:01:08;"- 50 pounds."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"- 50 pounds a gig, and then we'd split it between--"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"- Okay, I'm gonna follow up with MGMT about this"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"in the next episode."
01:01:13;01:01:15;"- We'd get about 50 pounds a gig,"
01:01:15;01:01:18;"and then we'd split it, and some money would go on"
01:01:18;01:01:21;"bits and bobs from charity shops and goodwill,"
01:01:21;01:01:24;"and then you'd stitch together an outfit from that,"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"and then you'd just get drunk and throw yourself"
01:01:26;01:01:29;"off the stage, so I don't know what scene that is,"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"but that's like--"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"You know, somewhere along the line,"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"you'd be covered in glitter and paint as well."
01:01:35;01:01:38;"- If I try to visualize the scene of you and Andrew"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"walking around at Reading or Leeds 2008,"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"I picture you wearing some flowy--"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"- I think, well, at the time we had--"
01:01:45;01:01:46;"- You might have been wearing a cape?"
01:01:46;01:01:47;"- It was my--"
01:01:47;01:01:48;"- Or a caftan?"
01:01:48;01:01:51;"- Yeah, it was definitely like a cape or a clown suit,"
01:01:51;01:01:54;"or one of those things, because I think the festival"
01:01:54;01:01:55;"we were--"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"Tabitha had all these--"
01:01:57;01:02:01;"Tabitha, you know, Tabs, who does all the artwork"
01:02:01;01:02:04;"and helps me with the visuals,"
01:02:04;01:02:06;"she had this old--"
01:02:06;01:02:09;"I think it's from the '20s, this '20s clown suit"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"that I put on at a festival,"
01:02:11;01:02:15;"and then that became, like, for the first video"
01:02:15;01:02:18;"and everything, we just did it all in that clown suit."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"Just sort of--"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"It was born at a festival."

01:04:52;01:04:55;"with Ezra Koenig on Beats 1."
01:04:55;01:04:59;"- Today we have a very special guest, Florence,"
01:04:59;01:05:01;"of ""Florence and the Machine,"""
01:05:01;01:05:04;"and her day one manager, Mare,"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"talking about mid-2000s London."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"[laughs]"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"So you lived in-- you're from London, right?"
01:05:10;01:05:11;"- Yeah. - So for me,"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"this is, like, a very important period in my life, too,"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"is when Vampire Weekend first signed to XL,"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"which is based in London. - Yeah."
01:05:17;01:05:20;"- So we started coming to London in 2007."
01:05:20;01:05:24;"- So 2007, 2008, 2009 to me is, like, this time when"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"I was in London a lot, I'm starting to, like, learn"
01:05:26;01:05:28;"about British people and things like this,"
01:05:28;01:05:30;"and I've only been told this later,"
01:05:30;01:05:33;"that that period of time, London-based indie music"
01:05:33;01:05:35;"is called Thamesbeat."
01:05:35;01:05:38;"- Yes, well, there was, like, a whole, like--"
01:05:38;01:05:41;"when I was, like, starting-- 'cause I grew up in London,"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"and, um, I grew up in Camberwell,"
01:05:43;01:05:45;"and there's a big art college in Camberwell,"
01:05:45;01:05:48;"and there were a lot of, like, sort of art college punk bands"
01:05:48;01:05:52;"that came from there, and one of them was Ludes,"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"and at that same time-- so they were doing--"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"- Wait, it's, like, Ludes like Quaaludes?"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"- Yeah, yeah, they're called Ludes,"
01:05:58;01:06:01;"and, um, my first boyfriend was in that band,"
01:06:01;01:06:03;"and so I kind of, like, got introduced to this--"
01:06:03;01:06:05;"- I didn't know you dated a Lude."
01:06:05;01:06:07;"- I did, I did. - Had any of them ever"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"actually done Quaaludes? 'Cause those are pretty much"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"impossible to learn. - I don't think they had."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"I don't think they had. But, um, but--"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"so--and then also-- so there was, like,"
01:06:15;01:06:17;"all these squat parties going on,"
01:06:17;01:06:19;"and, like, a Wow Wow art collective was happening,"
01:06:19;01:06:21;"but at the same time, there was, like, artists"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"like Jack Pignatte, Jamie T."
01:06:23;01:06:25;"- Okay, so Jack Pignatte-- I know him the best, I think."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"- Yeah, yeah. - 'Cause he was on Excel,"
01:06:27;01:06:31;"and I remember the first time I came to London with the band,"
01:06:31;01:06:33;"and I saw everybody was wearing kind of, like,"
01:06:33;01:06:35;"plaid shirts with the top button button."
01:06:35;01:06:36;"- Yeah. - Did he start that?"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"- He did, he did. - So Jack Pignatte's"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"an iconic figure in mid-2000s London fashion."
01:06:40;01:06:42;"- It's huge. - And--"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"- If you had-- - And he's also a lovely guy, obviously."
01:06:44;01:06:46;"- If you rolled up your trousers,"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"like, a little bit at the bottoms, like, tightly,"
01:06:48;01:06:51;"and then you had, like, those-- I think it was those, like--"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"those are, like, boat shoes or Reebok classics,"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"and you had your shirt buttoned all the way up"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"to the top of the chain, that was, like, Jack."
01:06:57;01:06:59;"Very stylish man. Jack--Jack started that."
01:06:59;01:07:02;"- Oh, yeah, he's a very handsome, stylish person."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"- But, yeah, I was watching him--"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"'cause we went to the same school as well."
01:07:06;01:07:08;"- Wait, and this is that school that, like, everybody went to?"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"- Alleyne's, yeah. - And Adele went there?"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"- No, no, no. - Wait, no, what school am I thinking of?"
01:07:12;01:07:14;"- That's the Brit school. - And that's, like,"
01:07:14;01:07:17;"the XX? - The XX didn't go to the Brit school,"
01:07:17;01:07:20;"I don't think. Adele went there, went to the Brit school."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Amy Winehouse went to the Brit school."
01:07:22;01:07:24;"- Okay. - Um, I went to Alleyne's,"
01:07:24;01:07:27;"which also Jack went to, and, uh,"
01:07:27;01:07:30;"some of the MacBees went to Alleyne's."
01:07:30;01:07:32;"So there was, like, a-- there was, like,"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"a Jesse Ware went to Alleyne's. - And you guys were all there--"
01:07:34;01:07:37;"so you guys were all, like, in, uh, chemistry together?"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"- They were a couple of years above me, actually."
01:07:39;01:07:41;"I was always-- I was always quite, like--"
01:07:41;01:07:43;"me and Jack would end up in musicals."
01:07:43;01:07:45;"And he would be cast as, like, the hooker,"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"and he would be the drunk guy."

01:10:32;01:10:34;"- I feel like also, like, in the U.K.,"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"people get started earlier. - Yeah, well, 'cause--"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"- Like, people get signed to record deals when they're 16."
01:10:38;01:10:40;"- Well, 'cause what you can do. - People, like, promoting parties"
01:10:40;01:10:41;"when they're 16. - Well, yeah, 'cause, like,"
01:10:41;01:10:43;"there's just so many, like-- in London,"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"what's really exciting-- like, how they started a whole scene."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"So there was, like, the Mystery Depths, there was Ludes,"
01:10:47;01:10:50;"there was Jamie T, and then there was, like, the Kooks."
01:10:50;01:10:52;"And so what would happen is--"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"- Everybody you're naming is technically Thames Beat."
01:10:54;01:10:55;"- I think-- I think so."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"- Can we get a confirm on that, Mariah?"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"- Yeah. - Okay."
01:10:58;01:10:59;"This is all Thames Beat. Got it."
01:10:59;01:11:01;"- And then, um-- and then, so--"
01:11:01;01:11:02;"but everyone was putting on, like, nights,"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"and so there would be a Kooks gig,"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"and then Kid Harpoon, he was a really big part of Thames Beat."
01:11:06;01:11:08;"- Oh, yeah, also on XL. - Yes."
01:11:08;01:11:13;"And there was this kind of, like, watery, piratey, like, thing"
01:11:13;01:11:16;"going on, and there was all these gigs happening,"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"and there would be, like, a big gig at Nambuka,"
01:11:18;01:11:19;"so the Kooks would play at Nambuka,"
01:11:19;01:11:21;"and then there would be an after-party at the pub behind"
01:11:21;01:11:25;"where Jamie T would play, and there'd be an open mic,"
01:11:25;01:11:28;"and I would be, like, drunk and singing on the open mic,"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"and so there was just this whole, like--"
01:11:30;01:11:33;"I think I then spent a really long time chatting to someone"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"while sitting on a bag of onions."
01:11:35;01:11:37;"- That's an open mic. - Wasn't that your first--"
01:11:37;01:11:39;"No, it was the first time you sang ""Kiss With A Fist""?"
01:11:39;01:11:41;"- That was the first time I sang ""Kiss With A Fist,"""
01:11:41;01:11:43;"and I was really inspired by all this kind of, like--"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"so all of my first songs were sort of inspired"
01:11:45;01:11:49;"by those, like, bluesy, sort of folky things,"
01:11:49;01:11:51;"so, like, ""Kiss With A Fist,"" ""My Boy Boards Coffins,"""
01:11:51;01:11:53;"""Girl With One Eye,"" which is on the first record."
01:11:53;01:11:55;"- Right, that really sounds, like, a little punkier."
01:11:55;01:11:57;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and, like, ""Girl With One Eye"""
01:11:57;01:11:59;"is a lewd song, and we covered it."
01:11:59;01:12:02;"- Okay, so all this stuff that people call Thames Beat,"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"do you think there's some kind of, like, stylistic unity?"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"Or this is just, like, people who went to school together"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"who lived in London who are making music."
01:12:08;01:12:10;"Is there an umbrella, like, style?"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"- I think it wasn't-- it was almost like--"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"it was quite visceral."
01:12:14;01:12:17;"Like, it was like-- there was something quite, like,"
01:12:17;01:12:20;"raw about it, I think, and a lot of it was--"
01:12:20;01:12:22;"I don't know, like, it was sort of--"
01:12:22;01:12:25;"Thames is the right word, 'cause it seemed to have"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"so much of, like, the river in it,"
01:12:27;01:12:29;"and, like, there was this kind of, like, idea of, like--"
01:12:29;01:12:31;"it just felt like lots of, like, washed-up pirates"
01:12:31;01:12:32;"all making music."
01:12:32;01:12:34;"- And you're well-known for loving water imagery."
01:12:34;01:12:35;"- Yeah, so I think there was--"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"- Is it possible you're the only person who really took"
01:12:37;01:12:39;"the Thames Beat water vibe to heart?"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"- Maybe. - And really took it to the top?"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"- Maybe. There was just a really--"
01:12:43;01:12:46;"especially when I met Maree, there was a really big scene"
01:12:46;01:12:49;"for, like, live music and people putting on club nights"
01:12:49;01:12:50;"and bands playing. - And there's some--"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"Thames Beat was definitely not, like, electronic."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"- So it's quite ramshackle. No, it wasn't."
01:12:54;01:12:55;"It wasn't electronic. It was all, like--"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"- So is Mumford Thames Beat?"
01:12:57;01:12:58;"- Mm..."
01:12:58;01:12:59;"- Maree's shaking her head no. - No."
01:12:59;01:13:01;"- No, they were after-- - They were after, yeah."
01:13:01;01:13:03;"- It's very collaborative. - Yeah."
01:13:03;01:13:05;"- Everybody just kind of-- you put on these parties."
01:13:05;01:13:07;"Everyone just got involved together"
01:13:07;01:13:09;"and just inspired each other, really."
01:13:09;01:13:14;"- It was ramshackled and, like, boozy and sort of loose"
01:13:14;01:13:17;"and, you know, really British."
01:13:17;01:13:19;"- And nobody had that care in the world."
01:13:19;01:13:20;"- Yeah. - Right."
01:13:20;01:13:24;"- They just had no agenda, just doing it for the love of music."
01:13:24;01:13:26;"No plan. Nobody had a plan."
01:13:26;01:13:28;"- Yeah, no, definitely no plan."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"- It sounds like it was just people having fun,"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"chilling, making music, being friends."
01:13:32;01:13:33;"- Yeah."
01:13:33;01:13:35;"- When's the golden age of Thames Beat?"
01:13:35;01:13:36;"Is it, like, 2007?"
01:13:36;01:13:40;"- I'd say from, yeah, 2006, '07, '08 was the heyday."
01:13:40;01:13:42;"- Okay, so then my next question is,"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"what destroyed Thames Beat?"
01:13:44;01:13:47;"- I want to know who coined the term."
01:13:47;01:13:49;"Like, who decided to call it Thames Beat?"
01:13:49;01:13:50;"- Yeah, that's a good question."
01:13:50;01:13:52;"- I feel like it might have been Kais."
01:13:52;01:13:53;"- Maybe it was Kais. - Maybe it was Kais."
01:13:53;01:13:56;"We're gonna get Kais on the phone to break all this down shortly."
01:13:56;01:13:58;"- Kais always talks about having a Thames Beat reunion,"
01:13:58;01:13:59;"which would be like,"

01:18:06;01:18:10;"is one of the best-selling waves of British music of all time"
01:18:10;01:18:15;"because if you add up Adele, Florence, Mumford & Sons,"

01:18:24;01:18:27;"But the thing is I remember a club night because, again,"

01:18:32;01:18:35;"It was just like you would just put on your friends' bands"

01:19:03;01:19:04;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:19:04;01:19:06;"But I would watch Kid Harpoon play and I just--"
01:19:06;01:19:11;"watching like Ludes, Kid Harpoon, watching those guys--"
01:19:11;01:19:13;"like Dave Ashby was the lead singer of Ludes"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"and he's the most amazing performer still--"
01:19:15;01:19:18;"and watching those guys perform with some of my--"
01:19:18;01:19:22;"and Jamie, those were my first big influences in performance."
01:19:22;01:19:23;"Yeah."

01:19:28;01:19:30;"And Jack, yeah, watching Jack, it was like--"
01:19:30;01:19:33;"there was so much energy to it, like it was a real like--"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"it was just an energetic time."
01:19:35;01:19:36;"Yeah."
01:19:36;01:19:37;"Wait, so I'll ask one more time."
01:19:37;01:19:38;"What killed Thames Beat?"
01:19:38;01:19:39;"It's sort of--"
01:19:39;01:19:41;"What destroyed Thames Beat?"
01:19:41;01:19:43;"Every golden age has its downfall."
01:19:43;01:19:45;"I think if you have like that--"
01:19:45;01:19:48;"the thing is like if it is that much ramshackle"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"and then it is like-- it's hard to keep it up."
01:19:50;01:19:51;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"What sounds like it was also very youthful."
01:19:53;01:19:54;"Yeah, yeah."
01:19:54;01:19:55;"Everybody just aged out."
01:19:55;01:19:57;"And also because there's no agenda."
01:19:57;01:19:58;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"It's just like-- it just does what it does."
01:20:00;01:20:01;"Right."
01:20:01;01:20:02;"It was a shooting star."
01:20:02;01:20:03;"Yeah."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"Everybody at that time, everyone was kind of on the same level."
01:20:05;01:20:06;"Yeah."
01:20:06;01:20:09;"I suppose it kind of changed as people got more successful."
01:20:09;01:20:12;"I guess it couldn't stay as crazy as it was."
01:20:12;01:20:14;"Adele started coming through with in-ears."
01:20:14;01:20:17;"[laughter]"
01:20:17;01:20:20;"And it's-- the vibe is totally different now."
01:20:20;01:20:22;"So Adele killed Thames Beat is what you're--"
01:20:22;01:20:23;"No!"
01:20:23;01:20:27;"Adele killed Thames Beat, but she gave birth to so many other things."
01:20:27;01:20:29;"That's life, right?"
01:20:29;01:20:32;"Thames Beat died so that Adele could live"
01:20:32;01:20:34;"and become the best-selling British artist of all time,"
01:20:34;01:20:36;"which is amazing, which I think is dope."
01:20:36;01:20:37;"Is that right?"
01:20:37;01:20:39;"Her second album is the best-selling British album of all time?"
01:20:39;01:20:40;"Probably."
01:20:40;01:20:41;"I reckon."
01:20:41;01:20:42;"And it's on an independent label."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"That's amazing."
01:20:43;01:20:44;"Yeah."
01:20:44;01:20:45;"So--"
01:20:45;01:20:46;"Oh, I didn't know that."
01:20:46;01:20:47;"Yeah, it's on XL."
01:20:47;01:20:48;"No, I mean I didn't know best-selling."
01:20:48;01:20:49;"I know it's on XL."
01:20:49;01:20:50;"It's definitely top ten."
01:20:50;01:20:51;"Definitely sold a lot of records."

01:20:52;01:20:53;"[laughter]"

01:20:56;01:20:57;"She did."
01:20:57;01:20:58;"That's crazy."

01:25:35;01:25:37;"No, but I'm saying, I think even if Thames Beat"
01:25:37;01:25:38;"was this kind of like ramshackle thing,"
01:25:38;01:25:41;"I think it's great that people came out of a scene like that"
01:25:41;01:25:42;"and did big things."
01:25:42;01:25:44;"Well, 'cause there was also, like, there was Thames Beat"
01:25:44;01:25:47;"and then there was, like, what Adele and, like,"
01:25:47;01:25:50;"I started singing a lot at was this sort of--"
01:25:50;01:25:53;"there was, like, a London folk scene that was really--"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"Wait, so now does that count Mumford?"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"I think so, yes."
01:25:57;01:25:58;"Maybe."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"I think what happens is, like, there was Thames Beat"
01:26:00;01:26:02;"and then it kind of, like, on the other side"
01:26:02;01:26:05;"there was, like, the Blue Flowers nights, like,"
01:26:05;01:26:09;"with the London folk scene with Johnny Flynn,"
01:26:09;01:26:10;"Laura Marling."
01:26:10;01:26:12;"How does Noah and the Whale fit in?"
01:26:12;01:26:15;"Noah and the Whale was in there, so, like, Jack and, like,"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"I was sort of--"
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Oh, so it sounds like Mumford killed Thames Beat."
01:26:19;01:26:22;"[laughter]"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"No, but that's, like, you know, that's like in America"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"in the '80s, you had all the hair metal"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"and then Kurt Cobain comes through and says,"
01:26:28;01:26:29;"""Enough of that."""
01:26:29;01:26:30;"[laughter]"
01:26:30;01:26:32;"It wasn't Marcus, Laura Marling's guitarist."
01:26:32;01:26:34;"Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:26:34;01:26:36;"So there was, like, the London folk scene"
01:26:36;01:26:39;"and I think Mumford and I was doing gigs there,"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"a bit in there, and you put on a folk--"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"a ""Folk It Up,"" ""Folking It Up."""
01:26:43;01:26:44;"""Folking It Up."""
01:26:44;01:26:45;"Was that a night?"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"That was, like, one of the first times I met Maraid"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"was going to the ""Folking It Up"" club night"
01:26:49;01:26:51;"and you were wearing a gold cape, actually."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"A gold cape."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"Jack played that."
01:26:53;01:26:55;"He dipped a toe in both scenes."
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Yeah, he was in the folk scene and the--"
01:26:57;01:27:01;"So I started doing gigs at a lot of the folk nights."
01:27:01;01:27:04;"I definitely thought you were a folk singer at the beginning."
01:27:04;01:27:05;"Yeah."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"'Cause your vibe could kind of hang with both"
01:27:07;01:27:08;"the folkies and the Thames Beat."
01:27:08;01:27:10;"Yeah, depending on how drunk I was."
01:27:10;01:27:11;"Right."
01:27:11;01:27:12;"I don't know."
01:27:12;01:27:14;"Well, look, these two scenes together,"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"this mid-2000s London folk scene and Thames Beat"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"have produced a lot of big, important music."
01:27:18;01:27:21;"Yeah, but what's so nice is actually when you do think about it,"
01:27:21;01:27:26;"it did all come from small live gigs, which is really, like--"
01:27:26;01:27:29;"I remember seeing Adele at that night"
01:27:29;01:27:33;"and you just knew it was something so special."
01:27:33;01:27:35;"Like, seeing it in that tiny room,"
01:27:35;01:27:39;"and she just sung with the guitar,"
01:27:39;01:27:42;"and I remember just going, ""Oh, my God."""
01:27:42;01:27:46;"So, you know, seeing it up that close and so early on,"
01:27:46;01:27:48;"you already knew that it was something really, really incredible."
01:27:48;01:27:49;"Yeah."
01:27:49;01:27:51;"All right, so if you had to pick one song"
01:27:51;01:27:54;"to really sum up mid-2000s Thames Beat,"
01:27:54;01:27:56;"what do you think is your iconic Thames Beat song?"
01:27:56;01:27:59;"It's probably Jamie T. Sheila, I think."
01:27:59;01:28:00;"We think--"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"Or--"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"""Happy as Annie,"" ""Larrick in Love."""
01:28:03;01:28:05;"Yeah, ""Happy as Annie,"" ""Larrick in Love."""
01:28:05;01:28:09;"And also, like, Tom Beard, who's taken all of my cover photos"
01:28:09;01:28:12;"and done all that, he was, like, best friends with ""Larrick in Love."""
01:28:12;01:28:13;"And he was, like, 15."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"Yeah, he was, like, 15, and that's how we all met."
01:28:15;01:28:17;"Like, that's how I met him in the first photo."
01:28:17;01:28:19;"And was he taking pictures of all this?"
01:28:19;01:28:20;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:28:20;01:28:23;"So when's the Thames Beat Rizzoli coffee table book going to drop?"
01:28:23;01:28:26;"He's got all of them, and he could make a Tom Beard--"
01:28:26;01:28:27;"Did you get on that?"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"Yeah, he could make a whole Thames--"
01:28:29;01:28:32;"Tom Beard, TB, Thames Beat, Tom Beard, Thames Beat."
01:28:32;01:28:35;"But I think it was just, like, the kind of the energy of it,"
01:28:35;01:28:39;"but then it never really, like, crossed out of its world"
01:28:39;01:28:42;"into, like, the sort of bigger public sphere"
01:28:42;01:28:44;"to have the support to carry on."
01:28:44;01:28:45;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:28:45;01:28:48;"Well, it didn't as, like, a genre, but obviously certain artists--"
01:28:48;01:28:49;"Yeah, some--"
01:28:49;01:28:52;"--were, like, kind of holding the torch for that vibe or something."
01:28:52;01:28:54;"Well, the vibe was sort of like--"
01:28:54;01:28:57;"Well, because the first gigs that I went to in the first--"
01:28:57;01:29:01;"It was all about, like, bottle of vodka plus bottle of paint,"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"put the two together, that's the show."
01:29:03;01:29:04;"Wait, wait, wait, bottle of paint?"
01:29:04;01:29:06;"Bottle of paint, bottle of vodka, drink the vodka--"
01:29:06;01:29:07;"What did you do with the paint?"
01:29:07;01:29:08;"Just pour it everywhere."
01:29:08;01:29:10;"Oh, okay."
01:29:10;01:29:11;"Glitter."
01:29:11;01:29:12;"Glitter, like, that was--"
01:29:12;01:29:13;"Flowers."
01:29:13;01:29:14;"That was the, like--"
01:29:14;01:29:15;"You kind of--"
01:29:15;01:29:17;"You know, it was all about sort of just--"
01:29:17;01:29:19;"It was so shambles."
01:29:19;01:29:22;"This is very fascinating to me because it--"
01:29:22;01:29:24;"I feel like I definitely wasn't there for it,"
01:29:24;01:29:26;"but maybe I saw, like, the after effects or something."
01:29:26;01:29:29;"The thing was about the party, really, as well."
01:29:29;01:29:30;"It was, like--"
01:29:30;01:29:34;"That was as important as the gig, if not more."
01:29:34;01:29:35;"Was the after party."
01:29:35;01:29:36;"Well, just the whole thing."
01:29:36;01:29:39;"It was like the show, the gig itself was like a big party,"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"and then afterwards, it was a big--"
01:29:41;01:29:44;"You know, it was all like this big kind of thing."
01:29:44;01:29:46;"Okay, Flores, why don't you set up the next song for us?"
01:29:46;01:29:50;"Yeah, this is Jamie T., ""Sheila."""

01:36:34;01:36:37;"you could draw the straightest line back to Thames beat from?"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"Ah, ""Ship to Wreck."""
01:36:39;01:36:41;"100%. That's almost a Thames beat song."

01:36:42;01:36:43;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:36:43;01:36:45;"You gave Thames beat pride of place on the new album."
01:36:45;01:36:47;"Well, the thing is, like, when I first started making music,"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"it was really inspired by that time,"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"and it was all songs like ""Kiss of the Fists"""
01:36:51;01:36:52;"and ""My Boy Builds Coffins,"""
01:36:52;01:36:55;"and actually then I had to go and find my own sort of style,"
01:36:55;01:36:58;"which was much more like dog days and piano, laird and drums."
01:36:58;01:36:59;"But I still, like--"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"because there was almost like a directness"
01:37:01;01:37:04;"and like a simplicity to the kind of the guitars and the--"
01:37:04;01:37:05;"you know, it was like songs."
01:37:05;01:37:06;"It was like classic songs."
01:37:06;01:37:09;"And I think when it came back to, like, writing this time,"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"""Ship to Wreck"" was a kind of example"
01:37:11;01:37:12;"of that style of songwriting"
01:37:12;01:37:15;"that I actually hadn't worked with in a while,"
01:37:15;01:37:16;"not since the first record."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"So yeah, it really, like--"
01:37:17;01:37:18;"That's a great song."
01:37:18;01:37:21;"And, like, the lyrical content, I wrote it with Kid Harpoon."
01:37:21;01:37:22;"Oh, really?"
01:37:22;01:37:24;"And it's all about getting drunk and trashing things."
01:37:24;01:37:25;"Like, that song is a Thames beat song."
01:37:25;01:37:26;"Straight up Thames beat."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"Trash canning."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"Yeah, trash canning, make-out time."

01:37:31;01:37:34;"So here is Florence, track one from her new album."
