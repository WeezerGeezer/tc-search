00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis back again. We have so much more to unpack when it comes to Travis Scott, McDonald's,"
00:06;00:15;"and modern existence. We also dig into the Rolling Stone Top 500 albums of all time. All that,"
00:15;00:26;"plus a little bit of floating dock, down by the river, country music. This is Time Crisis"
00:26;00:32;"with Ezra Koenig."
01:16;01:23;"Time Crisis back once again, and we're jumping right in because there's so much happening in"
01:23;01:30;"the TC universe. One of which is, if you recall, if you're an avid listener, at the end of the last"
01:30;01:35;"episode, Seinfeld did a deep dive for us about the whole Travis Scott, McDonald's thing. That was"
01:35;01:42;"actually one time, I think, TC was neither way ahead of the curve nor way behind. I feel like"
01:42;01:49;"we were actually like a surfer, perfectly. Like friend of the show, Kyle Field, Little Wings,"
01:49;01:54;"we were in repose on the board, just at the perfect moment, just in tune with nature. Because"
01:54;02:02;"I feel like the burger had just hit, and I felt the whole two weeks since, all I saw in my feeds,"
02:02;02:08;"my various feeds were non-stop Travis Scott, McDonald's stuff. I feel like a lot of the jokes"
02:08;02:13;"in Seinfeld, you know the most about memes here. Is this a correct interpretation? I feel like a"
02:13;02:21;"lot of the memes were about like dorky white kids going to McDonald's and being like, ""Cactus Jack"
02:21;02:28;"sent me!"" Is that, was that like a dominant part of the discourse? I feel like that was a definitely"
02:28;02:34;"like a TikTok trend for a minute. Because I'll tell you that in McDonald's press releases and"
02:34;02:41;"in their campaign, they used phrases like, ""Tell them Cactus Jack sent you!"" and ""It's lit!"" which"
02:41;02:47;"is like popular slang from like three years ago, four years ago. And I think that, yeah, the kids"
02:47;02:52;"you're describing found this very funny and would kind of go to drive-thrus. There are videos of"
02:52;02:57;"like guys rolling up at drive-thrus, you know, harassing McDonald's employees and being like,"
02:57;03:03;"""It's lit! Cactus Jack sent me!"" You know, on the other end you have the like harried McDonald's"
03:03;03:07;"workers being like, like there's one where the guy is like, ""Oh we're not playing around here,"
03:07;03:12;"like, like what do you want?"" kind of thing. Like not taking that nonsense from those kids. So yeah,"
03:12;03:17;"it was definitely like a meme on that level. You know what, young man? I've been on my feet for 12"
03:17;03:23;"hours surrounded by the bizarre fumes of the McDonald's kitchen in this hot little box."
03:23;03:28;"It is far from lit. And also, Seinfeld, you've been keeping us abreast on the time crisis text"
03:28;03:34;"thread. It does feel in a large sense like the things that we've been talking about for years"
03:34;03:39;"on the program, it's like reaching some kind of climax now. Just things that would have seemed"
03:39;03:45;"like an absurd joke, it's like beyond parody now. Because even the time, you know, there's always"
03:45;03:50;"been celebrity endorsements, right? And I feel like the kind of big musician, the Michael Jacksons,"
03:50;03:56;"the Reba McEntires, I feel like she was on a bag of Fritos once. It's not unprecedented."
03:56;04:02;"But what's weird about it is just like the endless drops. Because you were sending us like,"
04:02;04:09;"was it McRib shorts? Yeah, that was the Lonnie's dad shorts. The McRib shorts. It was kind of"
04:09;04:14;"absurd when we first talked about this two weeks ago. I was like stunned at how many different"
04:14;04:19;"pieces of merchandise they were hawking through this collection. And what I didn't realize at"
04:19;04:25;"the time was that that was just week one of a series. I think it was three or four weeks of"
04:25;04:32;"drops. So we're talking like around 200 different pieces of novelty Travis Scott merchandise."
04:32;04:38;"I can picture just like, we're old as f***. We're on our deathbeds, very old men. And we're just"
04:38;04:43;"like flick on the hardwired Neuralink TV in our brains. And just kind of see this image of like,"
04:44;04:52;"I am Travis Scott the third. When my grandfather began the collab with McDonald's in 2020,"
04:52;04:57;"the world was in disarray. Thank you, President Barron Trump for declaring."
04:57;05:02;"Like at that point, McDonald's no longer serves food."
05:02;05:12;"They only sell Travis Scott merch. Burgers were outlawed during President Ocasio-Cortez's first"
05:12;05:20;"year. Right. And I mean, it's so hyper specific, like the copy on the merch is like, I ordered the"
05:20;05:27;"Travis Scott McMeal at McDonald's September 8th to October 4th, 2020. You could really buy like"
05:27;05:34;"a memento of purchasing a McDonald's meal on a shirt. That's the shirt in particular that feels"
05:34;05:40;"one step beyond. Because also it costs like 80 bucks or something. An $80 long sleeve that just"
05:40;05:49;"says, I went to McDonald's and then the dates of the Travis Scott run. Jake, it's funny,"
05:49;05:55;"this idea of McDonald's just becoming Travis Scott merch stores, because it makes me think about"
05:55;05:58;"this is like the type of headline I remember seeing. And I was like, I don't even want to"
05:58;06:03;"click on it. But it was like about all these abandoned malls becoming Amazon fulfillment"
06:03;06:09;"centers. Perfect. I think there's just something about watching the transition from like one kind"
06:09;06:14;"of buff thing to another buff thing. Yeah, it's either going to be mega churches or Amazon"
06:14;06:19;"fulfillment centers. There's nothing about that that feels like positive urban renewal, where it's"
06:19;06:25;"like, oh, hell yeah. All these malls are centrally located in dense population centers. And a lot of"
06:25;06:29;"them are sitting empty because people don't do retail anymore. And now they're finally coming"
06:29;06:36;"back to life as Amazon fulfillment centers. You're just like, oh, man, we're just zigzagging around a"
06:36;06:43;"weird, uncomfortable existence. How crazy is that? We're just saying the term fulfillment center"
06:43;06:48;"with no irony. It's very physical release center. Get your physical release at the fulfillment"
06:48;06:55;"center. It's like a 2020 Billy Joel song. Anthony worked at the fulfillment center."
06:55;07:02;"Have you guys seen those Amazon fulfillment trucks, the delivery trucks? No, I think."
07:03;07:08;"I saw one on the street the other day because Amazon has their own fleet of trucks. And it was"
07:08;07:14;"like military grade, like a futuristic Brinks truck. It was like this cold sort of dark gray"
07:14;07:21;"color. And it had the Amazon logo with that arrow smile. It didn't make me feel good to see. I'll"
07:21;07:27;"put it that way. We're grasping in the dark here. We got from one weird version of the future to"
07:27;07:32;"another weird version and all the former McDonald's that are now full time. Travis Scott,"
07:32;07:37;"merch stores that'll actually be like the last stand of like humans. And Travis Scott,"
07:37;07:44;"the third will be like my grandfather's dying words were never let the Travis Scott McDonald's"
07:44;07:50;"merch empire become fully automated. We make these make rib shorts for people and they should be sold"
07:50;07:57;"by people. And then it's like this weird war of like the RoboCop, the Amazon RoboCops versus just"
07:57;08:02;"like the flesh and blood. Actually, that's a weird thing. I'm sure people have drawn this comparison"
08:02;08:06;"before. Everything's like brick and mortar versus online. But brick and mortar has a real resonance"
08:06;08:12;"with the phrase flesh and blood, brick and mortar, flesh and blood, brick and blood."
08:12;08:18;"It's not enough for a store to exist, IRL, because there's these Amazon stores that nobody even works"
08:18;08:24;"at. A true old school 20th century store has to be brick and blood where it's made out of bricks."
08:25;08:30;"Yeah. Also like a new cocktail bar in Brooklyn is brick and blood,"
08:30;08:36;"flesh and mortar. Wait, Seinfeld, are there people posting pictures of themselves wearing"
08:36;08:42;"the McRib shorts or the long sleeve? It says you bought the Travis Scott meal during this window"
08:42;08:48;"of time. So my understanding is that those merch products do not ship for something ridiculous like"
08:48;08:55;"12 weeks. So I don't think anybody's actually like put their hands on one yet."
09:30;09:34;"Part of the reason that obviously there's so much to talk about with the Travis Scott"
09:34;09:39;"McDonald's collab, I think we might look back on that as kind of more than the election of Trump,"
09:39;09:46;"more than the founding of Facebook in 2004. This might be one of these like hardcore before and"
09:46;09:52;"after moments in terms of American history, global history, corporate food history. But anyway,"
09:52;09:58;"with all this discussion, as we were on the TC Text thread, looking at some of the new merch items,"
09:58;10:03;"Jake made a bombshell revelation. Actually, can somebody pull it up and see verbatim?"
10:03;10:08;"Yeah, this was after Seinfeld sent us an image of the McRib shorts, which"
10:08;10:13;"doesn't get more TC. And then there was like a weird phrase on the McRib shorts that"
10:13;10:16;"caught my eye. And then I really dropped the bomb after that."
10:16;10:23;"Seinfeld, I'm gonna need a Travis Scott primer because it didn't come up last episode,"
10:23;10:25;"but I have no idea who Travis Scott is."
10:27;10:34;"When you say you have no idea who he is, I mean, you know, more or less what genre of music"
10:34;10:39;"he's in. I honestly don't. I don't know if he's a DJ or a rapper. I'm guessing one of the two."
10:39;10:43;"Okay. And even in the top five before, like we played Travis Scott."
10:43;10:49;"Well, I don't really pay that close attention. Didn't we have an hour and a half"
10:49;10:56;"runner of like, back to the future Travis Scott, like an entire thing about this?"
10:56;10:58;"Oh, right. That was a while ago."
10:58;11:01;"Well, but I guess again, you could participate in that kind of story without"
11:01;11:04;"you knowing that all you know is that this is a youngish famous person."
11:04;11:08;"Right. And I honestly, I'm like 50 50 on whether he's a rapper or a DJ."
11:08;11:11;"How come not a country dude? Travis Scott sounds like a country guy."
11:11;11:18;"That's true. I saw like an image of him on stage. It looked like a large festival,"
11:18;11:20;"which made me think maybe he's a DJ."
11:20;11:25;"He's a rapper. I mean, it's very possible. He has DJ, but yeah, the simplest way to describe"
11:25;11:30;"them. Obviously he wears many hats as a rapper. He was famously in a relationship with another"
11:30;11:35;"famous person. They have a child. I guess they're not together anymore. Do you have any idea who"
11:35;11:40;"who his former partner was? No. Do you know who Kylie Jenner is?"
11:40;11:44;"Yeah. I mean, I've heard the name. I know that she's Kim Kardashian's sister."
11:44;11:46;"Oh yeah. All right. Half sister."
11:46;11:50;"Is she the person that was the youngest billionaire for like having like a handbag?"
11:50;11:52;"Yes. Okay. All right. Yeah. Yeah."
11:53;11:58;"Close. Wow. Okay. Makeup, makeup line, right? Yeah. Makeup. She does lip stuff."
11:58;12:00;"So, you know, she's an entrepreneur. Yeah."
12:00;12:05;"So two entrepreneurs in that relationship. I guess my question is sort of like,"
12:05;12:10;"so Travis Scott is a rapper. Great. What is specific about him that makes McDonald's"
12:10;12:14;"want to team up? Why not? Any number of rappers?"
12:14;12:17;"That's a really good question. I feel Seinfeld. You could feel that the best."
12:17;12:21;"Well, I mean, definitely. I don't know if it's any more complicated than"
12:21;12:28;"Travis Scott just being sort of, you know, one of the most popular rap artists of the time. And,"
12:28;12:34;"you know, I remember when I was prepping for the McDonald's conversation, there was a quote"
12:34;12:39;"from somebody at McDonald's who said that they were having trouble connecting with Gen Z."
12:39;12:44;"And so Travis Scott was sort of this collaboration was one way to reach out to them."
12:44;12:46;"I bet they paid him an ungodly sum."
12:46;12:49;"For sure. Which is a step beyond princely."
12:49;12:53;"He didn't really get a princely sum. He got an ungodly sum because"
12:53;12:57;"if I was at McDonald's, I admire that they went for it. But especially because,"
12:57;13:02;"as we've discussed, the thing itself, the Travis Scott meal cost McDonald's literally nothing,"
13:02;13:07;"maybe a tiny bit of like extra barbecue sauce production or something."
13:07;13:09;"But it's like everything's there already."
13:09;13:15;"They were already doing the breakfast 24 hours. So the bacon's already available."
13:15;13:18;"They got the bacon, they got everything there."
13:18;13:21;"And you're right. And they got the Sprite on deck."
13:21;13:24;"So I'm sure without having to spend any money on that stuff, and then the merch stuff"
13:24;13:29;"pays for itself. It's almost like a life or death thing. Like you give Travis Scott"
13:29;13:35;"50 million dollars. And if that makes a huge dent in terms of us connecting with a whole generation,"
13:35;13:39;"creating a new kind of like loyal McDonald's customer worth it."
13:39;13:45;"Easy. 100 million dollars. It's probably somewhere in between. Maybe it's more like 30 or 40,"
13:45;13:47;"but just like an insane amount of money."
13:47;13:47;"Wow."
13:47;13:53;"And I think also part of it, Jake, is that he is the most popular rapper. I just thought of like"
13:53;13:58;"a way to describe him, I think. And I'm fairly out of the loop as well, because Travis Scott"
13:58;14:03;"seems to really resonate. I mean, he's good. He's good. I've seen him perform live. We probably"
14:03;14:08;"played five festivals last summer where we played right before Travis Scott."
14:08;14:08;"No way."
14:08;14:14;"Including in Poland. So I saw his show like a few times and it's like he's a great performer,"
14:14;14:19;"super high energy, just already a huge catalog of hits, a lot of really good songs,"
14:19;14:25;"interesting visuals and all that stuff. One way that I think might make sense to describe him is"
14:25;14:30;"if Kanye is Nirvana, he's Foo Fighters. Does this seem fair?"
14:30;14:31;"Ouch."
14:31;14:35;"People who know. Nicks. What? No, that's. Hey, you said that, not me."
14:35;14:36;"I know I said it."
14:36;14:40;"First of all, Foo Fighters, Jake, you've admitted they have some great songs."
14:40;14:43;"I wouldn't say great, but yeah."
14:43;14:47;"I think in terms of him being more populous, do you know what I mean?"
14:47;14:54;"And also like less chaotic to use an overused term. Nirvana. I mean, I hate to say it,"
14:54;15:01;"but like obviously Kurt Cobain was a troubled person, right? And there was something inherently"
15:01;15:07;"unstable about his relationship to fame. And so Nirvana, a lot of people might say there was like"
15:07;15:14;"a type of more originality, a passion or something compared to Foo Fighters, but also a type of like"
15:14;15:21;"chaos and a type of instability and suffering and the ups and downs of that kind of artist."
15:21;15:26;"Whereas like Dave Grohl is a front man. He's had this very long, successful career. I'm sure he"
15:26;15:31;"learned a lot by like being in a band with somebody who, you know, he watched somebody"
15:31;15:34;"suffer like that. And they're probably and also probably just different people. But I think"
15:34;15:40;"there's something similar about like the Kanye ricocheting up and down and left and right in"
15:40;15:45;"terms of the popular opinion and what people make of him and whether people like him or don't like"
15:45;15:51;"him and his world is full of chaos. And Travis Scott just kind of like real down the middle."
15:51;15:55;"And I'm not saying that his music is boring and I don't think Foo Fighters music is boring either."
15:55;15:59;"Like I said, I think they have great songs, but just like a kind of, I don't know,"
15:59;16:04;"like a business acumen, a stability that their predecessors didn't really have."
16:04;16:08;"- I mean, it totally makes sense. I mean, Travis Scott's the one teaming up with McDonald's,"
16:08;16:10;"not Kanye. - But not even just that."
16:10;16:16;"What I think might shed some light on it when quarantine started, he started doing"
16:16;16:23;"concerts in Fortnite, in the game. Like he saw, you know, that when you speak of Gen Z,"
16:23;16:27;"he was the one who said, you know, I'm going to connect with like all these young kids that are"
16:27;16:34;"playing this popular game and I'm going to put on a concert in the game. To Ezra's point, I think"
16:34;16:40;"that's sort of a very, the business acumen and sort of marketing aspect of what he can do is"
16:40;16:43;"pretty impressive. - And I think in a way to"
16:43;16:48;"keep beating my dead horse of a metaphor, and again, I'm not trying to like compare the music"
16:48;16:54;"because I don't think that's fair, but there's a way in which the Foo Fighters and Travis Scott"
16:54;16:59;"delivered on a set of ideas that respectively Nirvana and Kanye put into the universe,"
16:59;17:06;"but in ways that were like unstable and ultimately chaotic. And I mean, obviously Kanye is doing fine,"
17:06;17:11;"you know, compared to Kurt Cobain who tragically took his life at such a young age. But like,"
17:11;17:18;"if Kurt Cobain was somebody who was really interested in, could he marry a type of like"
17:18;17:24;"punk rock idealism with an ambition? And you know, like, I think we've talked about this before,"
17:24;17:29;"have you ever looked through his old journals? They like published a book of them and it's like"
17:29;17:34;"him as a teenager through his twenties, just like little scribbles and lyrics and stuff."
17:34;17:36;"- Yeah. - There's like a page somewhere"
17:36;17:41;"where he's just like trying out logos and stuff, which is not dissimilar from stuff I've seen from"
17:41;17:45;"Michael Jackson. Like when you watch a Michael Jackson doc and there's like literally a page from"
17:45;17:50;"his notebook in like the early 80s where he's just like, ""Study Fred Astaire, never stopped"
17:50;17:55;"practicing, sell 30 million albums."" Like visualizing a career path. And honestly, in the"
17:55;18:00;"Kurt Cobain journals, there's little hints of stuff like that too. A guy like Kurt Cobain,"
18:00;18:03;"probably on the one hand, he loved like the Melvins and..."
18:03;18:07;"- Beat happening. - Beat happening and the raincoats"
18:07;18:12;"and Daniel Johnston, like weird indie stuff. But there's no way that Kurt Cobain didn't like"
18:12;18:16;"Black Sabbath too and just like rock history stuff. You know, he might've had mixed feelings"
18:16;18:18;"about it, but I'm sure... - Credence Clearwater."
18:18;18:21;"- Yeah, probably. - Yeah."
18:21;18:25;"- I mean, some people even think that he took ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" from"
18:25;18:32;"Boston, ""More Than a Feeling."" And then, you know, people always talk about the pain"
18:32;18:38;"and the confusion of his success for him was like, ""Now there's these jocks in the audience."
18:38;18:42;"These are the people who used to beat me up and I don't with these guys."" You know, like,"
18:42;18:46;"again, I don't know how accurate this is, but that was the myth of Kurt Cobain, right?"
18:46;18:51;"A sensitive guy who made this like aggressive music that connected with everybody. And suddenly,"
18:51;18:56;"he's seeing the crowds full of, or partially full of meatheads and he doesn't know how to"
18:56;19:00;"reconcile all that because clearly he had split impulses. He wanted to be in a big,"
19:00;19:05;"successful rock band, but he also was like a sensitive, anti-establishment punk rocker."
19:05;19:10;"And then like the Foo Fighters, you could say, was actually like a more stable synthesis."
19:10;19:16;"Dave Grohl ended up being a big, long running, successful band. You know, whether Foo Fighters"
19:16;19:22;"music is as aggressive as Nirvana, that's a matter of taste, but he's like, ""Let me go get Pat"
19:22;19:27;"Smear."" Pat Smear was in ""The Germs,"" right? So, you know what I mean? In a sense, Dave Grohl's"
19:27;19:33;"like, ""I can marry these things. Let me find a great dude from an iconic punk band who never"
19:33;19:39;"got his due as a guitarist. Let me marry 'The Germs' in a sense with like the Rolling Stones,"
19:39;19:43;"a long running kind of business savvy rock band."" Like he put it together in a way that probably"
19:43;19:50;"was clearly didn't happen for Nirvana. And I think in a way like Kanye, before Travis Scott was even"
19:50;19:55;"making music, was out there talking about, ""I should be doing big collaborations with"
19:55;19:59;"these big corporations. People look down on rappers. They should be delivering us these"
19:59;20:05;"contracts that they give to other people."" And he made a lot of good points, but because his"
20:05;20:10;"public persona was so controversial, it took him a long time to get to where he is. Whereas like"
20:10;20:15;"the Travis Scott's of the world, probably because of everything that Kanye stirred up, can kind of"
20:15;20:20;"slide in in a pretty calm way and just being like, ""Yes, McDonald's collab, let's do it."" It makes"
20:20;20:23;"sense that this is the moment. - That's fascinating. I mean,"
20:23;20:30;"how long has rap been a genre? Like 40 years or so? - Yes. Yeah. Just about. A little more."
20:30;20:36;"- Can you picture a time before this time where a major corporation like McDonald's would have"
20:36;20:41;"teamed up with a rapper? - Not like this. I actually remember"
20:41;20:48;"I had a CD in the 90s. McDonald's used to sell or give away CDs. And one was a compilation of hip hop."
20:48;20:51;"Let me see if I can find it. Because it was actually really good."
20:51;20:56;"- Wait, McDonald's used to have CDs? - McDonald's made a CD that's called"
20:56;21:04;"""Hip Hop and Jazz"" from 1995. I could buy this CD on Amazon. I used one for 94 cents."
21:04;21:11;"It's a pretty good deal. Let me see if I can find the track list. But on the front already, it says"
21:11;21:20;"that the CD has us three, Jazz Mataz, Digable Planets, The Soul Sonics, Joy and Lonnie Gordon."
21:20;21:24;"You know, I'm sure somebody listening who's like a real 90s hip hop head might be like,"
21:24;21:28;"""That's not that cool."" But even then, somebody at McDonald's was like,"
21:28;21:33;"""We should make a CD that highlights the intersection of hip hop and jazz and sell it."""
21:33;21:38;"- Is Travis Scott the first musician? I mean, I guess he's the first person they've done a"
21:38;21:43;"big collaboration with since Michael Jordan. Is he the first musician to straight up,"
21:43;21:47;"to do a huge collaboration like this? - Maybe a huge collaboration."
21:47;21:53;"- You could kind of picture in the 70s, maybe KISS, but KISS was maybe too dark and weird."
21:53;21:57;"- I'm sure we've probably got somebody listening at home who's off the top of their head is"
21:57;22:02;"thinking of all sorts of like, ""Well, actually McDonald's did a commercial with this rapper in"
22:02;22:07;"19..."" I'm sure there's examples, but I think you're right. There's something about this that"
22:07;22:13;"feels slightly new. And it might just be about the fading fortunes of McDonald's, relatively"
22:13;22:19;"speaking, that it's not just them like, ""Oh, we could sell a CD, a hip hop CD to maybe show"
22:19;22:25;"people we're down. We could do a commercial and have some..."" There's something about this that"
22:25;22:29;"actually feels like, and again, I assume he got paid an ungodly sum, but there's a funny way in"
22:29;22:36;"which this kind of feels like McDonald's bowing before Travis Scott and saying, ""Please help us."""
22:36;22:39;"- Oh my God. - It's not like when Nike gives somebody a"
22:39;22:44;"partnership. That's just what you do when you become a big athlete. You get a few offers and"
22:44;22:49;"you go with Nike. It's par for the course. There's something about this that does feel like"
22:49;22:55;"it's bigger, it's more in depth than any kind of just endorsement or commercial that I could think"
22:55;22:56;"of. -"
22:56;23:06;"(singing)"
24:06;24:10;"(singing)"
24:10;24:16;"- I think part of also what's so remarkable about it, and maybe also we were always heading"
24:16;24:26;"in this place in terms of late capitalism, collab culture, society, the spectacle, post-modernism."
24:26;24:31;"I'm talking about things I only half understand now, but one thing I do understand is that for"
24:31;24:36;"the past 50 years, there've been a lot of people talking about the way our culture's changed and"
24:36;24:44;"how everything's mediated by images and spectacles and, what's that phrase some people use, pseudo"
24:44;24:49;"events, kind of post-truth, post-modern world that we live in. We're all familiar with, which has only"
24:49;24:54;"been exacerbated by social media. But there's something funny about this, especially where it's"
24:54;24:58;"like, we've talked about the Arch Deluxe on the show before, right? - Yes."
24:58;25:04;"- So just to recap for anybody listening who somehow doesn't remember what the Arch Deluxe is,"
25:04;25:08;"that was in the late '90s. McDonald's launched a new burger called the Arch Deluxe,"
25:08;25:13;"and they poured millions and millions of dollars into researching it, developing it,"
25:13;25:18;"and then marketing it because they felt like they needed a new burger to get more grownups in."
25:18;25:23;"Kind of the opposite of this. They needed a burger that felt a little classier, a little more"
25:23;25:26;"elegant, it had a big fat tomato on it. - Dude."
25:26;25:32;"- It's hilarious to think some marketing firm or research group paid like $20 million and they"
25:32;25:36;"came back and they're just like, ""Hey, McDonald's, we just realized something."" They're like, ""What?"
25:36;25:41;"None of your burgers got a big fat tomato slice on it. Your regular burger has all this weird"
25:41;25:47;"chopped up sh*t. Big Mac is like shredded lettuce and goo. What a grownup associates with a burger"
25:47;25:50;"is a slice of tomato."" - I mean, they're saying to McDonald's,"
25:50;25:53;"""Hey, can you like up the standards of your sourcing a little bit?"""
25:53;25:57;"- Right. - Because like, to have a big slab of tomato,"
25:57;26:01;"you need to have like nice ass tomatoes. - And I'm sure that's like an insane"
26:01;26:05;"investment for them because it's like, suddenly they need a whole new distribution network."
26:05;26:10;"Wait, does a regular McDonald's burger literally not have tomato on it, just ketchup?"
26:10;26:13;"- And a pickle. - Yeah, it has pickles and"
26:13;26:15;"chopped up onions. - No tomatoes."
26:15;26:18;"- No tomatoes on a Big Mac? - No."
26:18;26:19;"- Okay, so- - Shredded lettuce."
26:19;26:21;"- How? - Shredded lettuce, no tomatoes."
26:21;26:26;"- Because if you have tomatoes, you need to have your staff slicing tomatoes like in the morning."
26:26;26:31;"Like normally, I think everything at McDonald's would come in like vacuum sealed bags that you"
26:31;26:33;"just open. - It would just kill the margins,"
26:33;26:36;"is what you're saying. - It would kill the margins and slow down"
26:36;26:39;"their famously fast process. - Yeah, you would need to like have a guy"
26:39;26:44;"slicing tomatoes for two hours in the morning. - Or every location would need some special"
26:44;26:50;"tomato slicing machine that costs $8,000. Yeah, McDonald's is not (beep) with tomato slices,"
26:50;26:56;"even though go to any backyard barbecue, there's often gonna be a plate with some slices of"
26:56;27:02;"American cheese, onions, and tomato. It is very much part of the American burger experience."
27:02;27:07;"But yeah, like you said, suddenly it's like, we want tomatoes and McDonald's is like,"
27:07;27:11;"literally they're talking to the Seinfeld 2000 at McDonald's. The CEO is just like,"
27:11;27:17;"""Let me get a number crunch."" And he's just like, ""We're looking at $89 million for the first year,"
27:17;27:22;"sir."" And he's like, ""Can you amortize that over a decade if the Arch Deluxe is a hit?"""
27:22;27:27;"""Okay, then we're in the black, sir."" He says, ""Yeah, like it's like the (beep) new trucking"
27:27;27:32;"routes, having to go find the farms and like, ""Sir, I don't know, it's gonna be tough in the"
27:32;27:37;"Dakotas to get the Arch Deluxe."" It's like, ""All right, whatever."" It was a lot of money"
27:37;27:43;"to reach a new audience. Just for the record, the full Arch Deluxe makeup, the ingredients were"
27:43;27:49;"a quarter pound of beef on a split top potato flour sesame seed bun. So that's like a different"
27:49;27:57;"bun. A new bun. A new bun topped with a circular piece of peppered bacon, leaf lettuce, tomato,"
27:57;28:03;"American cheese, onions, ketchup, and a secret mustard and mayonnaise sauce. That's a new sauce."
28:03;28:08;"Imagine the guy pitching that and you work in accounting. You're about to vomit when you hear"
28:08;28:13;"all that stuff. How great would it have been, I'm sorry, but how great would it have been if"
28:13;28:19;"when they were saying to Travis Scott, ""All right, deals basically closed."" Or the final yard line,"
28:19;28:24;"they said, ""All right, what do you want?"" ""I want Sprite."" ""Great."" Sprite instead of Coke."
28:25;28:29;"Sprite instead of Coke. ""Great."" ""I want the fries to come with a barbecue dipping sauce."""
28:29;28:36;"""Great."" We got that. ""Great."" And the tomato. That's what I grew up with. I love a tomato"
28:36;28:43;"on my burger. And they all stop for a silent. No, but the genius of the Travis Scott meal,"
28:43;28:48;"it was his version of a McDonald's meal. Of course, it's his version."
28:48;28:53;"No, actually, he's not bringing any outdoor ingredients."
28:53;28:58;"I was going to make a similar joke that before McDonald's went to Travis Scott, they went to me"
28:58;29:03;"and I had a very similar meal. And they said, ""What is it?"" And I said, ""Okay, Sprite instead"
29:03;29:09;"of Coke. All good. Barbecue sauce instead of ketchup. Easy."" And then I said, ""And bacon"
29:09;29:14;"on the quarter pounder. No problem."" And I said, ""Well, hold on a second though."
29:14;29:20;"I need a big piece of circular peppered bacon, like the one from the Arch Deluxe."""
29:20;29:27;"And they said, ""Well, we can't do that, obviously. The Arch Deluxe almost bankrupted us. We don't"
29:27;29:31;"have that circular peppered bacon anymore. We could use regular bacon."" And I said,"
29:31;29:36;"""It's got to be circular and it's got to be peppered."" And they said, ""We're going with"
29:36;29:42;"our runner up, Travis Scott."" And that's how I lost $75 million. But when I think about the"
29:42;29:47;"Arch Deluxe, you think about how much money went in for the circular. You got to get the machine"
29:47;29:53;"that cuts the bacon and the circle and the pepper. It's so expensive. And that's like some old school"
29:53;29:57;"where somebody was like, ""We need to save this company by adding a new thing that's going to"
29:57;30:02;"get new people in the door."" What's brilliant about this, and back to this, the society of"
30:02;30:07;"the spectacle, everything is just like a vague gesture at something. Nothing's real. What's"
30:07;30:15;"amazing about this is Travis Scott comes in with a similarly exciting idea, except his, it's nothing."
30:15;30:21;"It's like doesn't exist. It's literally just the celebrity saying, ""Go to McDonald's and order"
30:21;30:24;"something that you could have been ordering for your entire life, but you never thought of it"
30:24;30:28;"because you don't actually like Sprite and you actually like to have your fries with ketchup."
30:28;30:33;"But now I'm telling you to go just ask for this random sh*t. And on top of that, here's a website"
30:33;30:38;"full of clothes that you can order, but they don't even exist yet. And they may or may not get to you"
30:38;30:43;"in three months."" I just love that none of it exists. - How many people went in and ordered"
30:43;30:50;"the Travis Scott meal and then asked if they could have ketchup? And also some step it out for a Coke."
30:50;30:57;"- I watched a video or somebody posted on Instagram. I think this must've been Bill"
30:57;31:02;"Simmons is the ringer guy. I always want to call him Bill Walton because it's sports."
31:02;31:07;"It's funnier to imagine Bill Walton, but he kind of like filmed his son as they pulled into"
31:07;31:11;"McDonald's. He's like, ""I'm going to McDonald's for the first time in years because my son wants"
31:11;31:14;"this Travis Scott burger."" And he's kind of making fun of his son for like taking this."
31:14;31:17;"- I saw this, yeah. - And one thing I clocked in the video"
31:17;31:20;"is that they pulled to the drive-thru and he's like, ""Can I get the Travis Scott meal?"" And they"
31:20;31:24;"say like, ""What do you want to drink?"" And the kid's like a Coke. And he's like, or they asked"
31:24;31:29;"him like, ""Do you want a Coke or Sprite?"" And he's like, ""Coke."" So it's like already the sacred meal"
31:29;31:34;"has crumbled. It's like religion. It's just like an esoteric idea that by going to McDonald's and"
31:34;31:42;"ordering something that's already exists, you are somehow participating in the cult of Travis Scott."
31:42;31:46;"And then you look at the clothes and it also wouldn't shock me with like the McRib shorts."
31:46;31:50;"We've talked about this before. Travis Scott sells a load of merch. Maybe a lot of people"
31:50;31:54;"are trying to buy it, but also it wouldn't shock me if they didn't even actually make the McRib"
31:54;31:59;"shorts. They just created it so that people like us are like, ""Holy, they made McRib shorts."""
31:59;32:05;"So I just love the idea that like maybe Travis Scott, he's very savvy, smart guy. Maybe he studied"
32:05;32:09;"the history of McDonald's and he went into them and said, ""Hey guys, just slip in a little bit."""
32:09;32:16;"I've actually done a lot of research on the whole Arch Deluxe debacle. By my estimate, you lost"
32:16;32:22;"hundreds of millions of dollars on all that bulls**t. I can get you a very similar amount of"
32:22;32:28;"hype and clout. I only need a tenth of the money. And they might've been like, ""Hell yeah,"
32:28;32:36;"let's do it."" He's like, ""None of this s**t even has to exist."" It's amazing. It's like nothingness."
32:36;32:41;"I guess this show should do its due diligence and follow up and try to order the McRib shorts."
32:41;32:43;"Do we have the budget for that?"
32:43;32:47;"I think the drop is over. I think you'd have to go on StockX. Where, by the way,"
32:47;32:52;"I've seen these items for resale at like two and three times the value that they were being sold."
32:52;32:57;"But I saw people don't even have it yet. This is like, wait, uh-oh."
32:57;32:58;"Futures."
32:58;33:01;"And this sounds a lot like the 2008 financial crash for people."
33:01;33:09;"What are all these funny big short words? People are purchasing tranches of Travis Scott"
33:09;33:15;"McDonald's speculative merch and reselling it and they don't have it. And then if there's like a"
33:15;33:24;"StockX margin call. I feel like I'm vaguely using these words. Who's our finance guy on the team?"
33:24;33:26;"Who knows the most about finance here?"
33:26;33:27;"Not me. No."
33:27;33:30;"Maybe Nick. Nick, are you a finance guy?"
33:30;33:32;"No, I'm absolutely not a finance guy."
33:32;33:36;"No, but the best part would be them breaking up the shorts into millions of pieces."
33:36;33:43;"What is that? When they like, re-bundle?"
33:43;33:49;"Right. It's like the New York Firefighters Retirement Fund."
33:49;33:50;"Has invested."
33:53;33:58;"Invested tens of millions of dollars in this Travis Scott thing and it's,"
33:58;34:01;"it went up in smoke. It was a full made off. Yeah, it's just like."
34:01;34:04;"Oh yeah, it's so made off. The shorts didn't even exist."
34:04;34:10;"It didn't even exist. You're trading tiny pieces of merch tranches so small and esoteric,"
34:10;34:14;"you didn't even know what it was. And meanwhile, there's some poor schmuck,"
34:14;34:19;"some poor kid in Florida, sitting in his house waiting for these shorts. And you know what?"
34:19;34:25;"That kid's f***ed. These are real people's lives. Do you understand what we're talking about?"
34:25;34:29;"It's real clout. It's real clout we're talking about. Just as a footnote,"
34:29;34:34;"McDonald's spent over $300 million on research, production and marketing for the Arch Deluxe."
34:34;34:35;"It was $300 million?"
34:35;34:37;"According to Wikipedia."
34:37;34:41;"Holy s***. So even if they paid Travis Scott $75 million,"
34:41;34:45;"again, this is 20 plus years ago. I love it. Just nothing exists."
34:46;34:49;"I just want to say for Jake, not knowing really much about Travis Scott,"
34:49;34:54;"I have had this thought for real in the past that Travis Scott didn't really exist."
34:54;34:57;"And you can't say that about a lot of artists, but because of the"
34:57;35:03;"Cactus Jack and because he's all the face covering and then he's now doing these shows"
35:03;35:09;"in a Fortnite in a video game. There has been this kind of ambiguity around him,"
35:09;35:13;"almost like a little Michaela or something that I have had a thought."
35:13;35:20;"Then when you start saying, oh, now he's done this project with McDonald's where he's introduced"
35:20;35:24;"nothing new, just a name. And now the shorts don't exist that he's merchandising."
35:24;35:25;"It does fit into this whole."
35:25;35:26;"Wow."
35:26;35:33;"Yeah. You know, of a created celebrity that honestly, before this, you know, I looked him"
35:33;35:36;"up and I said, you know, I don't even really know if I know what he looks like. Like,"
35:36;35:38;"I know if I have an idea of is what his hair."
35:38;35:43;"Wow. This is I was saying this to Jake the other day that it's like I've been listening"
35:43;35:48;"to him for a little while. I couldn't really describe what he sounds like or like what his"
35:48;35:54;"voice like. He's very it is very ethereal. Like Travis Scott is a concept is very like."
35:54;35:57;"Dude, Travis Scott is the CIA plant."
35:57;36:02;"It's a sign up. I think he's also just savvy because and again, there might be some 14 year"
36:02;36:06;"old listening who's just like, you guys are morons. Like, oh, I'm sure actually like deeply"
36:06;36:11;"connected to his fans. He might also just understand some of the nuances of modern"
36:11;36:17;"marketing. One thing that I can say as somebody who's kind of one foot in one foot out by always"
36:17;36:22;"using the action figure avatar of himself, which was the cover of one of his albums and not just"
36:22;36:26;"the album like that, that version of him, the action figure Travis Scott pops up a lot."
36:26;36:28;"It's in the McDonald's campaign."
36:28;36:29;"Oh, it is the McDonald's campaign."
36:29;36:30;"It was, it's all merch."
36:30;36:37;"When I picture him, when I do a Google image search of my mind's eye, one of the top two"
36:37;36:42;"pictures is the action figure, the eternal avatar. You can imagine that when Travis Scott,"
36:42;36:48;"the third is assumes control of the empire, he might actually still be performing in Fortnite"
36:48;36:54;"and whatever the modern neural link version of it is. There's like a way that Travis Scott can"
36:54;36:58;"transcend the brick and blood physicality world."
36:58;37:02;"I think it's interesting though, that you guys said that you're not even sure what he looks like."
37:02;37:03;"We do know what he looks like."
37:03;37:07;"It's honestly, it's an, it's an idea of what he looks like."
37:07;37:12;"I know. And the thing is, I see him all the time. I mean, that's, but it's something he's"
37:12;37:18;"always eschewing is like, he's covering his face. That's right. He's, he is his avatar."
37:18;37:23;"And it's, you know, obviously like his music, it's like heavily auto-tuned in a, in a brilliant way."
37:23;37:29;"I'm a fan. I'm just saying that it has occurred to me before with someone who has so many singles"
37:29;37:36;"and is so ubiquitous to not really understand. And like, to not have a clear picture of what"
37:36;37:40;"he looks like or be able to describe what he sounds like."
37:40;37:41;"How about this?"
37:41;37:42;"It's wild."
37:42;37:43;"Is he the contemporary Steve Miller?"
37:43;37:49;"I don't know what Steve Miller looks like."
37:49;37:54;"And Steve Miller is completely ubiquitous. It's very middle of the road."
37:54;37:56;"Travis Scott has more hits than Steve Miller."
37:56;38:01;"I'm not bringing this up in a qualitatively negative sense. I'm not trying to bag on"
38:01;38:02;"Travis Scott. I'm just saying."
38:02;38:06;"Travis Scott, Steve Miller and future is Jerry Garcia."
38:06;38:10;"A little wilder, a little weirder. If I'm interpreting what you guys are saying correctly,"
38:10;38:15;"because like, I do feel like I know what Travis looks, Travis Scott looks like it sounds like,"
38:15;38:22;"but I see your point a little more when I compare him to comparably big hip hop artists."
38:22;38:27;"When I compare Travis Scott to Kanye, Drake, even Tekashi 6ix9ine."
38:27;38:29;"These are people who are-"
38:29;38:30;"I can picture all of those guys."
38:30;38:35;"And Tekashi 6ix9ine, he's a little too spicy probably to get big endorsements."
38:35;38:39;"But Drake, for instance, Drake is big enough and well known enough that he could get"
38:39;38:46;"a McDonald's campaign theoretically. But Drake, to get to where Drake is,"
38:46;38:51;"he had to like become America's sweetheart more. He had to give more of his personality."
38:51;38:54;"He had to be more open and be more like a regular celebrity."
38:54;39:01;"I think Travis Scott has somehow become as ubiquitous as a Drake or a Kanye or a Tekashi 6ix9ine"
39:01;39:04;"without doing all that. And that is interesting."
39:04;39:09;"Ezra, would you say that Travis Scott is almost like a Bourgesian figure?"
39:09;39:14;"I didn't want to say, but it crossed my mind. I mean, as much as I like to give credit to Van"
39:14;39:21;"Fleet for understanding the nuances of the Bourgesian literature and existence,"
39:21;39:27;"I do think Travis Scott is the celebrity of our times. He understands things better."
39:27;39:30;"It's like Kanye is so much more-"
39:31;39:36;"Okay, here's one thing I can say. And I'm sure, again, this has become a little bit of like"
39:36;39:41;"aging dude's hip hop hour, but that's okay. That's partially what time crisis is."
39:41;39:47;"If we were 10 years older and we were talking about Kanye, at peak Kanye, like 10 years ago,"
39:47;39:51;"even though we would still be like older and a little more out of the loop,"
39:51;39:57;"Kanye just used traditional media in such a familiar way. Like everybody knows who Kanye is."
39:57;40:03;"Their grandparents talking about, ""Oh, Kanye, he's the man who grabbed the mic from Taylor Swift."""
40:03;40:07;"Again, it's like familiar using the typical tools of mass media. You know what he looks like."
40:07;40:11;"You know his big iconic media moments. Travis Scott is more elusive. And in that sense,"
40:11;40:17;"he's almost more present than... Again, to compare him to Tekashi 6ix9ine, and again,"
40:17;40:22;"this has nothing to do with my understanding of music, just my deep love of the Arch Deluxe."
40:23;40:29;"But Tekashi 6ix9ine, he's a familiar guy. He's in the middle. Travis Scott is both more than him"
40:29;40:34;"and less than him. You know what I mean? Tekashi 6ix9ine is brick and mortar, flesh and blood."
40:34;40:41;"Travis Scott is like the eternal digital soul and the mysterious nothingness at the heart of"
40:41;40:45;"existence. You know what I mean? - He's like the ghost in the machine, almost."
40:45;40:49;"- He's the ghost in the machine. - Incidentally, I don't know if we'd"
40:49;40:52;"mentioned this, but Travis Scott is something of a protege of Kanye West's."
40:52;40:56;"- Right. It's always been unclear to me what their relationship is."
40:56;41:02;"- It seems like Travis was briefly signed to Kanye West's Good Music as a producer,"
41:02;41:06;"and then I think he struck out on his own, but there's no love lost between them."
41:06;41:09;"- Wait, that means... - They were related, basically, for a while."
41:09;41:11;"- That's true, too. - I've always been"
41:11;41:15;"slightly confused by this phrase, ""no love lost."" That means that people don't love..."
41:15;41:18;"they don't love each other. - Yeah, I thought that was a negative."
41:18;41:21;"- Did I use it the opposite way? - Yeah, you did."
41:21;41:23;"- Well, you know what I mean. You're saying they're cool."
41:23;41:26;"- They're cool with each other? - I think they're cool with each other,"
41:26;41:29;"but wait, no love lost. - It means they never loved each other,"
41:29;41:33;"so there's nothing lost. - Oh, but okay, I get that, but it could"
41:33;41:38;"also literally mean the opposite, right? Like, if they love each other and they still love each"
41:38;41:43;"other, there is no love lost. It's an odd phrase. - They love each other. No, I get it. I mean,"
41:45;41:47;"I understand. I've never been 100% clear on that phrase."
41:47;41:52;"- So, Jake, I hope that all answers your question about who Travis Scott is. I think if you look at"
41:52;41:58;"his Wikipedia, it said, ""Travis Scott is an American rapper, Bourgesian figure, ghost in"
41:58;42:05;"the machine, and inverted negative space arch deluxe of American culture."" That's who he is."
42:05;42:09;"- Restaurant consultant. - Wait, Jake, one thing. Can you guess"
42:09;42:12;"what Travis Scott's real name is? - I can't."
42:12;42:17;"- He is Jacques Webster II. - It's really not a bad name."
42:17;42:21;"- Jacques Webster, teaming up with McDonald's. - I mean, I think that's sort of part of his"
42:21;42:27;"mystique that he has chosen to use another real name as a moniker for-"
42:27;42:31;"- Well, I was thinking that maybe that was part of the appeal of McDonald's too, because it's like,"
42:31;42:36;"it could be an athlete. Like Ezra said, it could be a country star. I'm picturing some grandma"
42:36;42:40;"taking her grandkids to McDonald's and the kids being like, ""Let me get the Travis Scott meal."""
42:40;42:45;"And the grandma's like, ""Who's that? Is he a football player? No, he's a rapper. Oh, okay."""
42:45;42:48;"- Because it's too first- - But if it was like the Post Malone"
42:48;42:54;"meal at McDonald's, it wouldn't be as appealing to sort of like Main Street."
42:54;42:59;"Be like, ""What's Post Malone? What's that? Who's that?"" It would just be confusing to people."
42:59;43:07;"Travis Scott, it's like a very innocuous name. It rolls off the tongue. Easy. The Travis Scott meal."
43:07;43:11;"- Right. It's simple. It's kind of a nothing name. See, that's what's funny."
43:11;43:14;"- Yeah, it's not loaded. - He actually had a more interesting name"
43:14;43:21;"and he became Travis Scott. It's not like he became like old dirty bastard or nothing man,"
43:21;43:25;"or just like gave himself kind of like a cool, weird, provocative superhero name."
43:25;43:30;"He took like a kind of cool name like Jacques Webster II and became just Travis Scott."
43:30;43:36;"- His original name is almost like a Bond villain. Jacques Webster II."
43:36;43:42;"- Anyway, so I guess, bottom line- - Well, I feel like I've learned some things."
43:42;43:46;"- McDonald's and Travis Scott. I think we barely scratched the surface here. I think we need to go"
43:46;43:52;"read up on some French philosophy to fully, truly understand this cultural moment."
45:08;45:13;"- That's enough about new music. Jake, I heard you have some things to say about the new Rolling Stone"
45:13;45:15;"Top 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. - Oh, that's right."
45:15;45:19;"- Which dropped this past week. Which by the way, I didn't realize it was dropping"
45:20;45:25;"and I heard about it because I was in the studio with Ariel and somebody hit him up about it"
45:25;45:30;"because he voted. Then I vaguely remembered, ""Oh, yeah. I remember getting an email that said,"
45:30;45:36;"'Do you want to vote in this?' and clocking it."" Then I was realizing I never did."
45:36;45:41;"Once again, I failed culture. Just like the times where I didn't get to vote in the Grammys,"
45:41;45:47;"I didn't vote in the Rolling Stone 500. Apparently, people like Beyonce did, so"
45:47;45:53;"I would have been in good company, but I didn't. I f*cked up. I found out there's one Vampire"
45:53;45:58;"Weekend album in there, Modern Vampires of the City. One funny thing is nobody hit me up about"
45:58;46:05;"it. Maybe nobody cares to tell me that a seven-year-old album is in the top 500. Then I"
46:05;46:09;"was trying to think, ""When's the last time they did one?"" I have some vague memory that maybe our"
46:09;46:15;"first album used to be in there. Anyway, it made me wonder a lot. I would love to know what fell"
46:15;46:21;"out. Somehow, Arielle knew. I don't know if it has to do with the person who told him, but Arielle"
46:21;46:27;"was like, ""Did you hear that ZZ Top fully fell out of the top 500 this time?"" I guess in years past,"
46:27;46:34;"they had both Trace Ombres and Eliminator in the top 500, but no more. Anyway, that's my experience"
46:34;46:39;"with the top 500. Jake, how did it come across your desk? -There was a lot of activity around"
46:39;46:45;"it in my Twitter feed. Initially, I was like, ""Who cares?"" Then I looked at it today, and this"
46:45;46:53;"made a few notes of what stuck out to me. I do want to say Modern Vampires of the City was number"
46:53;47:01;"328. -Solid. -You were edged out by The Who live at Leeds. -I'm surprised that that actually is"
47:01;47:09;"still in there. -I know. Here's a question. What do you think is the highest-ranking indie record?"
47:10;47:15;"Something that would be unambiguously categorized as indie. -Unambiguously? That's a great question."
47:15;47:21;"Velvet Underground, we couldn't call unambiguously indie. That was a phrase that didn't exist then."
47:21;47:29;"-Indie is post-punk. -We're saying '82, '83 at the earliest. -An R.E.M. album, maybe? -No."
47:29;47:37;"Huge artists, never mind number six. -Nirvana's not indie? -Right. -I know what you mean."
47:37;47:42;"-True indie. -Something that didn't sell millions of copies. -Yeah. I don't know. Slanted and"
47:42;47:47;"Enchanted? That's a classic critics pick. -That's what I would have guessed, too. That was coming in"
47:47;47:57;"at 199. There was a record at number 56, also released on Matador. -Matador? Is it from the 90s?"
47:57;48:06;"-It is. -Is it guided by voices? -No, GPV was denied in between the 500. -I love"
48:06;48:11;"Belle and Sebastian, but I doubt they're coming at 56. -No. -Cat Power? -No, there was no Cat"
48:11;48:16;"Power on the list. There was a Belle and Sebastian in the 400s, if I remember."
48:16;48:24;"But you're getting warmer with Cat Power. Solo female artist on Matador. -Was Liz Phair on Matador? -Oh,"
48:24;48:30;"right. I noticed that. -Exile in Guy Vaux, which is a great record. I love that record. -And that is also"
48:30;48:35;"a classic critics' fave. That's something about when I look through this stuff, and to Rolling"
48:35;48:40;"Stone's credit, first of all, thank you for inviting me to vote. I'm setting a terrible example for"
48:40;48:46;"everyone. Obviously, please vote in the upcoming elections. I am proud that we got an album in there"
48:46;48:50;"without me voting, because then I would have had to deal with the moral quandary of whether or not"
48:50;48:56;"to vote for us, which I don't think I could have brought myself to do. But I know for a fact that"
48:56;49:02;"Arielle voted, and I know that Beyoncé voted because they said she voted. So then I'm wondering how many..."
49:03;49:08;"I assume it's a mix of critics and artists? -I know that Stephen Hyden voted. I saw that on"
49:08;49:14;"his Twitter. Let me just read this to you. ""To do so, we received and tabulated the top 50"
49:14;49:19;"albums lists from more than 300 artists, producers, critics, and music industry figures."
49:19;49:27;"The electorate included Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, rising stars or artists like"
49:27;49:33;"Her, Tierra Whack, Lindsey Jordan of Snail Mail, and veterans such as Adam Clayton and The Edge"
49:33;49:41;"from U2, Raekwon from Wu-Tang, Gene Simmons, and Stevie Nicks."" -I mean, all right, to their credit,"
49:41;49:46;"they really were trying to get a mix of old and young. And the newest album I saw on there was"
49:46;49:51;"Frank Ocean Blonde, which came out like four years ago. And there was, oh, Kendrick Damm. Kendrick"
49:51;49:56;"Damm was probably the newest album that I saw. -And the Harry Styles record from last year was"
49:56;50:01;"on there. -Okay, so maybe that was the newest. It was the Harry Styles from last year was up in there."
50:01;50:06;"But the truth is, even if they make a big push to get a bunch of young people to vote, you know,"
50:06;50:11;"like, I'm sure Taylor Swift and Beyoncé are going to throw down a lot of classic albums. -Yeah."
50:11;50:18;"-It might take a hundred years for you to start to see a totally changing of the guard. -Yeah."
50:18;50:26;"-Because if I did it, which is the title of O.J. Simpson's book, if I did it, I'm sure I would have"
50:26;50:30;"picked a few albums from the past decade. But I hate to say it, if I was honest with myself,"
50:30;50:33;"I'd be picking a lot of, like, basic, tasteful..."
50:34;50:39;"I never said nothing."
50:39;50:51;"I never said nothing."
50:51;50:59;"I never said nothing."
50:59;51:05;"I never said nothing."
51:05;51:10;"-Speaking of, where do you think the highest-ranking Grateful Dead record was?"
51:10;51:16;"-I remember clocking American Beauty. Definitely not top 100. That sounds like in the"
51:16;51:21;"two or three hundreds to me. -Yeah, it was 215. That's a top 100 record."
51:21;51:27;"-Get Jacob Ballett next month. -I wonder if it was weighted voting,"
51:27;51:32;"because I was surprised to see the Kiss live album on there, number 305."
51:32;51:35;"-Interesting. -I was just picturing Gene Simmons just"
51:35;51:42;"listing that album 50 times. -Right. 500 is such a big number that it's like,"
51:42;51:49;"by the time you get down to the last Tyree Stiles record, is that four votes is enough to get you in"
51:49;51:53;"the top five? Because there must be thousands and thousands of records that got one vote."
51:53;51:56;"-Yeah. -And there's just not enough consent."
51:56;52:01;"Also, one thing I'll say is that probably some artists like the Grateful Dead are at least"
52:01;52:06;"partially the victims of like... I bet Grateful Dead would be top 100 if you were asking people"
52:06;52:13;"to vote on the 50 most iconic artists of the post-war era, because it'd be very easy for a lot"
52:13;52:18;"of people to say, ""Well, Grateful Dead, look what they accomplished."" Not every artist has a"
52:18;52:24;"Sgt. Pepper's where it becomes this article of faith that that's their opus."
52:24;52:26;"-Right. -I can even picture some people being like,"
52:26;52:31;"""Well, my favorite Beatles album is like, I don't know, like Magical Mystery Tour,"
52:31;52:35;"you know, but I got to put Sgt. Pepper because that's more of an iconic, important album."""
52:35;52:40;"You know, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. So in the case of the Grateful Dead, nobody's"
52:40;52:46;"going to put like, ""Blues for Allah."" It's part of their story, and they're as iconic as the Beatles"
52:46;52:51;"to me in many ways, but they don't have that album that every... I guess American Beauty is their"
52:51;52:57;"closest. -Well, yeah, I'd say that the Deadheads that would actually be voting for the dead are"
52:57;53:01;"like, so deep in it that American Beauty is too basic. -Right."
53:01;53:05;"-True Deadheads are not down with talking about American Beauty."
53:05;53:08;"-What were some of your other observations? -I thought there was a huge omission because"
53:08;53:14;"there was a ton of compilation albums, which I understand for some of the artists that were"
53:14;53:20;"making music before the album became the sort of de facto form. So like, you're like Muddy Waters,"
53:20;53:23;"Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry. -I understand that that's a couple of legends."
53:23;53:28;"-But then there was like Bob Marley Legend and like Madonna Immaculate Collection,"
53:28;53:33;"which is a little bit like... And those are artists that had actual real albums"
53:33;53:39;"elsewhere in the top 500. So it made me think the most glaring omission is the greatest selling album"
53:39;53:41;"of all time. -Oh, it's the Eagles, right? So Eagles' greatest hits..."
53:41;53:44;"-Eagles' greatest hits was not in there. -Was Hotel California in there?"
53:44;53:50;"-Yes, it came in at number 118, which is respectable. -Was that the only Eagles album?"
53:50;53:53;"-I think the first Eagles record was in there somewhere."
53:53;53:56;"-Yeah. -It's a ridiculous thing to go to bat for, but..."
53:56;54:00;"-It's a self-fulfilling privacy thing where it's like, even though it's such a huge selling album,"
54:00;54:06;"it doesn't have the... Even an Eagles fan critic person would still pick Hotel California over it."
54:06;54:10;"I don't know exactly why. Hotel California just has more of this aura."
54:10;54:14;"-Yeah, I mean, I just... -Legend is also like..."
54:14;54:21;"-Legend is the most basic greatest hits CD you'd ever have next to the Eagles' greatest hits."
54:21;54:26;"-Legend famously, similar to Dark Side of the Moon, I think, was in the... There used to be a"
54:26;54:32;"thing, billboard charts. They created an alternate chart for stuff that had been out forever,"
54:32;54:37;"and Legend was up there with Pink Floyd as just this perennial seller. So there is..."
54:37;54:45;"It's a real thing that Legend, I'm sure, dwarfs any other Bob Marley album in terms of sales."
54:45;54:47;"-Oh, I'm sure. -I guess, obviously,"
54:47;54:51;"you're saying that's the same thing with the Eagles. But there's something about Legend"
54:51;54:58;"that became the de facto entry point for all subsequent generations of people interested"
54:58;55:02;"in Bob Marley. So it's like, even though you're right, it is just kind of like a random greatest"
55:02;55:07;"hits. There's something about Bob Marley Legend that does have... Maybe just because it sold so"
55:07;55:14;"many copies, it has this aura. And I think Bob Marley, for the average American fan,"
55:14;55:18;"doesn't have a Hotel California. -Yeah. There was a few other things"
55:18;55:24;"I thought were interesting. The highest ranked U2 album. -I clocked this too. It's Octoon, baby,"
55:24;55:27;"right? It's above Joshua Tree. -Yeah. And they were really close together."
55:27;55:34;"Octoon was 124, Joshua was 135. And then similarly, much to the consternation of..."
55:35;55:39;"Or it would be much to the consternation of James Gandolfini if he was still with us."
55:39;55:45;"Green Day Dookie coming in at number 375. American Idiot, 248."
55:45;55:47;"-Oh, man. Come on. -Just like blowing Dookie out of the water."
55:47;55:54;"-That's the classic bias towards capital I important works. American Idiot was seen as like"
55:54;55:59;"Green Day speaking truth to power, tackling big ideas, talking about the state of the world,"
55:59;56:04;"the state of America, all this. Whereas Dookie... -It's called Dookie."
56:04;56:13;"-Whereas Dookie is called Dookie. I mean, Dookie is a more important record than American Idiot by"
56:13;56:14;"any metric. -Oh, yeah."
56:14;56:17;"-I'm not dissing American Idiot, but come on, we're talking about Dookie here."
56:17;56:20;"-It's a beautiful record. -It's a beautiful record."
56:20;56:24;"-Rumors came in at number 7. Fleetwood Mac Rumors, 7."
56:24;56:28;"-Solid. I wonder if Rumors is going up in the charts. I could imagine like 10,"
56:28;56:31;"20 years ago, people not wanting to give it up for Rumors in the same way."
56:31;56:37;"-For sure. Because the first one was in '03 and then they did a revised one in 2012."
56:37;56:43;"I was shocked to see Rumors so high up at number 7, but I was equally shocked to see no Tusk."
56:43;56:49;"-Tusk is too funky for a lot of people. -Shut out. But I feel like music nerds,"
56:49;56:53;"who it seems like the most people, like people submitting their ballots for probably"
56:53;56:58;"professional musicians or music nerds, are like up on Tusk, right?"
56:58;57:03;"-If you told me that Tusk was in there like 297, I'd be like, ""Yeah, oh cool."""
57:03;57:07;"-Sure, of course. -It took a Tres Hombres slot."
57:08;57:20;"Drowning in the sea of love Where everyone would love to drown"
57:20;57:28;"But now it's gone It doesn't matter what for"
57:30;57:37;"When you build your house Then call me home"
57:37;57:43;"And then there were definitely like, yeah, like 10 Bob Dylan records, every Kanye record."
57:43;57:46;"As we've discussed many times, Kanye and Bob Dylan, a lot in common."
57:46;57:53;"I did notice that Dark Twisted Fantasy edged out Highway 61."
57:53;57:54;"Oh, they were like next to each other?"
57:54;57:58;"They were next to each other. It was like, you know, whatever it was, like 19 and 20"
57:58;58:04;"or whatever it was. Then I was thinking, if I had to choose like the greatest all-time album,"
58:04;58:09;"I would probably just choose like Alien Lanes. But I acknowledge that that doesn't have"
58:09;58:14;"the cultural footprint that is required for an album to be the greatest."
58:14;58:19;"And then I was looking through it and then I saw that Kanye and I love Twisted Fantasy,"
58:19;58:23;"but then I was like, maybe Highway 61 would be my number one. I don't know."
58:23;58:26;"I'm not gonna like rack my brain over it, but like..."
58:26;58:27;"It's a great album."
58:27;58:30;"At a certain point, you kind of throw up your hands, right? I mean, it's sort of like..."
58:30;58:33;"I always get confused between that and bringing it all back home"
58:33;58:35;"because the covers are similar with the white borders."
58:35;58:38;"Also, I got into them at the same time. So it's like..."
58:38;58:42;"But yeah, Highway 61 is..."
58:42;58:44;"I think you're saying it opens with like a Rolling Stone."
58:44;58:46;"It's like a Rolling Stone from a Buick."
58:46;58:54;"Tom Thumbs, Blues, it closes with Desolation Row, Queen Jane approximately. I don't know."
58:54;58:56;"The Ballad of a Thin Man?"
58:56;58:57;"That's on there. Yeah."
58:57;58:59;"Well, it's also... I think there's something funny too."
58:59;59:04;"We really got to do like a philosophy episode because I got some things I want to..."
59:04;59:06;"Some questions I want to ask. Get some real philosophers on."
59:06;59:10;"There's something also that inherent in the proposition"
59:10;59:13;"of asking people to list the greatest 500 albums."
59:13;59:18;"I can picture a lot of people bending their own preference to the spectacle."
59:18;59:23;"Like I was talking about the example of somebody whose personal favorite Beatles record or..."
59:23;59:27;"You know, is something... And yet they'd know that to represent the Beatles,"
59:27;59:31;"they have to bend to Sgt. Pepper because that's like the one that"
59:31;59:36;"is been said to be so important over and over again that its importance is like..."
59:36;59:42;"The orders of magnitude greater than, you know, even like the White Album or something."
59:42;59:45;"It's like what I said. If it was just me, I'd be choosing Alien Lanes,"
59:45;59:46;"but I wouldn't because I would be..."
59:46;59:51;"That's a pathetic choice because it doesn't have cultural reach."
59:51;59:56;"And yet it doesn't have cultural reach because the policeman in your head said,"
59:56;59:59;"""You're about to write Alien Lanes,"" and said, ""Jake, you're under arrest."""
59:59;01:00:01;"You almost put something that mattered to you."
01:00:01;01:00:06;"You know what? Alien Lanes, Ezra, Alien Lanes is unelectable."
01:00:06;01:00:11;"Right. You're like, ""Alien Lanes is your Bernie."""
01:00:11;01:00:13;"You're just like..."
01:00:13;01:00:20;"Listen, man, in a perfect world, I would love to see Alien Lanes top 10."
01:00:20;01:00:21;"It's just not going to happen."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"It's pie in the sky, Jake."
01:00:23;01:00:27;"Throw that off your list and put Pet Sounds, man."
01:00:27;01:00:29;"You're like, ""I never actually throw on Pet Sounds."""
01:00:29;01:00:33;"Jake, just suck it up and put down Pet Sounds and you're just like, ""Yes."""
01:00:33;01:00:37;"Pet Sounds was number two, which was..."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"I was surprised how high that was."
01:00:39;01:00:42;"When we were in the studio and we were talking about it and we were kind of..."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"There was some like, ""All right, scrolling to number one."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"Guess what it's going to be. Guess what it's going to be."""
01:00:46;01:00:47;"And I was like, ""Uh, uh."""
01:00:47;01:00:49;"And I said, ""Pet Sounds."""
01:00:49;01:00:51;"I knew it wasn't going to be Sardine Pepper for whatever reason."
01:00:51;01:00:54;"And number one, by the way, for anybody listening was"
01:00:54;01:00:57;"Marvin Gaye, ""What's Going On,"" right?"
01:00:57;01:00:58;"Yeah, it was."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"When I actually think about my favorite albums of all time,"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"the ones I spent the most time with in my life,"
01:01:02;01:01:05;"I think I saw at least one of these albums in there."
01:01:05;01:01:10;"The two albums that I truly was obsessed with at an important time in my life"
01:01:10;01:01:15;"were Something Else and Village Green Preservation Society by The Kinks."
01:01:15;01:01:16;"I think I saw one of them in there."
01:01:16;01:01:18;"I think Village Green was..."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"Oh, no, Something Else was definitely in there."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"Maybe they both were."
01:01:21;01:01:24;"Something Else has Waterloo Sunset on it, right?"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"Yeah."
01:01:25;01:01:25;"I mean, it is funny."
01:01:25;01:01:28;"God, I'm glad I didn't fill this out."
01:01:28;01:01:31;"I would have had a breakdown if I had to vote in this election."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"Coming in with 50 albums would be hard."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"That's stressful."
01:01:35;01:01:38;"It would take hours to really..."
01:01:38;01:01:38;"I literally just..."
01:01:38;01:01:42;"With this thought experiment, I'm thinking, ""All right, let's just forget about top 50,"
01:01:42;01:01:43;"but top 10."""
01:01:43;01:01:46;"I'm like, ""Would I put a Beatles album in my top 10?"""
01:01:46;01:01:47;"And I'm stressed out about it."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"It's like..."
01:01:48;01:01:50;"What's your favorite Beatles record?"
01:01:50;01:01:53;"Well, when I was growing up, it might just be because my parents had it."
01:01:53;01:01:53;"Sure."
01:01:53;01:01:57;"I knew Magical Mystery Tour better than a lot of albums."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"I love that record."
01:01:58;01:02:02;"And by the way, if there's any stats geeks listening, Beatles stats geeks,"
01:02:02;01:02:07;"I recognize that Magical Mystery Tour is considered a soundtrack or a compilation"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"and not a studio album exactly."
01:02:09;01:02:09;"I hear you."
01:02:09;01:02:14;"I get it because some of these things were released as singles and blah, blah, blah."
01:02:14;01:02:14;"But whatever."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"It feels and looks like an album."
01:02:16;01:02:21;"I was limited before I started having my own money to buy CDs to just listen to whatever"
01:02:21;01:02:22;"records my parents had."
01:02:22;01:02:25;"And they didn't have Revolver and they didn't have The White Album."
01:02:25;01:02:29;"I think they had Sgt. Pepper's and Magical Mystery Tour."
01:02:29;01:02:31;"And straight up as a kid, I would throw on..."
01:02:31;01:02:35;"I would choose Magical Mystery Tour over Sgt. Pepper every time."
01:02:35;01:02:38;"I mean, because Magical Mystery Tour had Strawberry Fields Forever."
01:02:38;01:02:42;"The song Magical Mystery Tour is actually an amazing recording."
01:02:42;01:02:42;"Yep."
01:02:42;01:02:45;"That's crazy trumpet with the echo and stuff."
01:02:45;01:02:46;"It's so weird."
01:02:46;01:02:51;"Fool on the Hill is like actually a very haunting, dark, weird song."
01:02:51;01:02:51;"What else is on that?"
01:02:51;01:02:52;"Your Mother Should Know."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"Yeah."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"Kind of like..."
01:02:55;01:02:55;"Annie Lane."
01:02:55;01:02:58;"No, dude, I prefer Magical Mystery to Pepper."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"This is why we're friends, Jake."
01:03:00;01:03:00;"Man, I can't..."
01:03:00;01:03:03;"Can you believe all these years we've known each other,"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"we're still discovering new things we have in common."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"Oh, yeah."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"I Am the Walrus."
01:03:09;01:03:09;"Oh, yeah."
01:03:09;01:03:12;"Blue Jay Way, which also is the most LA Beatles song"
01:03:12;01:03:17;"because Blue Jay Way is a street in West Hollywood, Beverly Hills."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"Yeah."
01:03:18;01:03:18;"The Bird Streets."
01:03:18;01:03:21;"There's a fog upon LA."
01:03:21;01:03:25;"I think people look at Magical Mystery Tour and they're like,"
01:03:25;01:03:26;"""Oh, it's kind of corny."""
01:03:26;01:03:27;"Because it has..."
01:03:27;01:03:31;"There's a strain of Beatles corniness in it with Penny Lane and stuff."
01:03:31;01:03:34;"But if you're willing to interpret a song like Penny Lane"
01:03:34;01:03:39;"as being actually a haunting, sad vision of suburbia,"
01:03:39;01:03:40;"which to me it is,"
01:03:40;01:03:44;"then suddenly this album feels as deep and dark as Sgt. Pepper."
01:03:44;01:03:45;"That song is sad and weird."
01:03:46;01:03:49;"Penny Lane, there is a barber showing photographs"
01:03:49;01:03:53;"Of every head he's had the pleasure to know"
01:03:53;01:03:57;"And all the people that come and go"
01:03:57;01:04:00;"Stop and say hello"
01:04:00;01:04:06;"On the corner is a banker with a motorcar"
01:04:06;01:04:10;"The little children love him behind his back"
01:04:10;01:04:14;"And the banker never wears a mask"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"In the pouring rain"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"Very strange"
01:04:19;01:04:25;"Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes"
01:04:25;01:04:34;"There beneath the blue suburban skies"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"I sit and meanwhile back..."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"Dude, you know what a fun game is?"
01:04:38;01:04:39;"I don't know if you've ever done this on tour,"
01:04:39;01:04:44;"but have someone try to list the tracks of a Beatles record"
01:04:44;01:04:45;"from by memory?"
01:04:45;01:04:48;"Like Abbey Road, Go."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"Can you name all of the tracks in order?"
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Oh my God."
01:04:51;01:04:52;"Oh my God."
01:04:52;01:04:55;"Dick Paxton went to Chicago last year and played with you."
01:04:55;01:04:57;"We were staying in this Airbnb and after the show,"
01:04:57;01:05:01;"we had some like late ass night of like drinks and pizza"
01:05:01;01:05:02;"and then it was like three in the morning."
01:05:02;01:05:05;"We were like, no dude, mean Mr. Mustard."
01:05:05;01:05:08;"And then it goes to Paul Feen's Lamb."
01:05:08;01:05:09;"Abbey Road is tough."
01:05:09;01:05:13;"Is track one on Abbey Road, Here Comes the Sun?"
01:05:13;01:05:17;"It depends on the version because my parents had an old vinyl copy"
01:05:17;01:05:19;"where the track one was Here Comes the Sun,"
01:05:19;01:05:23;"but then I had like a tape or a CD later where it was Come Together."
01:05:23;01:05:23;"Oh."
01:05:23;01:05:26;"And I noticed that when some of the Beatles records,"
01:05:26;01:05:30;"like my parents had like copies of like Rubber Soul,"
01:05:30;01:05:33;"where like the first song was I've Just Seen a Face,"
01:05:33;01:05:36;"which on the CD was like Unhelp."
01:05:36;01:05:39;"Yeah, back then the American version would always be different"
01:05:39;01:05:42;"than the UK version and same with the Stones records."
01:05:42;01:05:43;"I can't fully recall."
01:05:43;01:05:46;"Is track one on Revolver Taxman?"
01:05:46;01:05:46;"Yeah."
01:05:46;01:05:48;"What a weird way to kick that album off."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"I'm into it though."
01:05:49;01:05:55;"Okay, obviously track one on Sgt Pepper is Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"
01:05:55;01:05:58;"followed by I Get By With A Little Help From My Friends."
01:05:58;01:06:01;"Track three, I'm drawing a blank actually."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"Do you know what track three is?"
01:06:02;01:06:03;"Lucy."
01:06:03;01:06:04;"Is Lucy?"
01:06:04;01:06:05;"Oh, that's a strong opening."
01:06:05;01:06:10;"I understand why Sgt Pepper is more electable than MMT."
01:06:10;01:06:11;"Of course."
01:06:11;01:06:15;"And also the truth is, I think for a while, if I had to pick my second,"
01:06:15;01:06:18;"because Magical Mystery Tour, that was like my favorite as a kid."
01:06:18;01:06:20;"As an adult, hands down, it's the White Album."
01:06:20;01:06:21;"Yeah."
01:06:21;01:06:25;"It's weird and it ties into the Manson murders in a sense."
01:06:25;01:06:26;"Track one."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"Back in the USSR."
01:06:28;01:06:28;"Boom."
01:06:28;01:06:35;"This is like the show that people have been getting into."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"That's what Time Crisis should be from now on."
01:06:37;01:06:39;"Just like, can you name?"
01:06:39;01:06:43;"Every time we have a guest, it's just like, can you name a Beatles album,"
01:06:43;01:06:45;"front to back, track list from memory, go."
01:06:45;01:06:48;"Tom O'Neill, welcome to the show."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"We love your new book, Chaos."
01:06:50;01:06:55;"Speaking of Helter Skelter, can you name a Beatle?"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"That's a really good game."
01:06:56;01:06:58;"It makes me realize how few I really know."
01:06:58;01:07:03;"Track one on something else, which I claim is one of my favorite records, is David Watts."
01:07:03;01:07:08;"Track two, Death of a Clown maybe."
01:07:08;01:07:09;"It's tough."
01:07:09;01:07:09;"It is tough."
01:07:09;01:07:10;"Sorry, which record is this?"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"Something else by the Kinks."
01:07:12;01:07:15;"That's one of those albums that I just somehow missed."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"Maybe partially because my friends--"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"You ever get into the song Waterloo Sunset?"
01:07:19;01:07:20;"Oh, of course."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Waterloo sunset."
01:07:22;01:07:22;"Yeah."
01:07:22;01:07:23;"You know what's crazy?"
01:07:23;01:07:28;"I know this is kind of sacrilege, but maybe I should start with something else."
01:07:28;01:07:33;"I've tried to do Kinks full length records and I haven't connected."
01:07:33;01:07:38;"And I love their singles from all different eras, 60s through the 80s."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"But I just haven't--"
01:07:39;01:07:40;"Right."
01:07:40;01:07:46;"Like, I'll throw on the 8-man one, the one with Lola on it, or I'll throw on Village Green."
01:07:46;01:07:49;"There's always at least four or five great songs."
01:07:49;01:07:54;"But I feel like the ones that aren't great are really just like, oh, God."
01:07:54;01:07:59;"I remember a year ago throwing in Village Green and that song is amazing."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"I love that song."
01:08:01;01:08:01;"Right."
01:08:01;01:08:03;"The rest of the record, I was just tuning it out."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"And I was like, what is wrong with me?"
01:08:05;01:08:06;"I should love it."
01:08:06;01:08:07;"I like that whole record."
01:08:07;01:08:10;"I could see you finding it a little twee."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"Like, some of the other songs are weird."
01:08:11;01:08:14;"Like, there's a song called Animal Farm."
01:08:14;01:08:16;"It's not like some political commentary."
01:08:16;01:08:19;"It literally is just like this fantasy of living on a farm."
01:08:19;01:08:25;"I actually remember, because I like that album so much, reading an article once that was about"
01:08:25;01:08:30;"how Ray Davies did a show with Yola Tango, or he sat in at some thing they were doing"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"in Hoboken."
01:08:31;01:08:34;"And he was like, well, what songs do you want to play?"
01:08:34;01:08:37;"And they were naming all these deep cut songs, including Animal Farm."
01:08:37;01:08:38;"And he was like, why the f*ck do you want to play that?"
01:08:38;01:08:42;"He was so alienated by them just being like, oh, sh*t."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"I mean, we got to do Animal Farm."
01:08:44;01:08:45;"He's like, what?"
01:08:45;01:08:48;"Like, in his head, he's probably like, I literally haven't thought about that song in 40 years."
01:08:48;01:08:55;"And they're probably stoked to like, semi-impress him and show to him what huge fans they are."
01:08:55;01:08:55;"Right."
01:08:55;01:08:58;"Which we always go either way with somebody."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"Let's just play Waterloo."
01:08:59;01:09:02;"Yeah, let's give the people what they want."
01:10:00;01:10:02;"All right."
01:10:02;01:10:07;"So there's one, again, it's so hard to keep up with all the TC news and the world is just"
01:10:07;01:10:09;"becoming more TC every day."
01:10:09;01:10:14;"There was an announcement about a week and a half ago that was just so TC, it was hard"
01:10:14;01:10:15;"to believe it was real."
01:10:15;01:10:20;"There was someone on Twitter that was like, during the pandemic, TC has become this like"
01:10:20;01:10:24;"minority report style, like predictor of future events."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"Right, exactly."
01:10:26;01:10:28;"Like, dystopian."
01:10:28;01:10:33;"Truly, when we started this sh*t five years ago, could we ever imagine the abundance of"
01:10:33;01:10:34;"just TC?"
01:10:34;01:10:37;"I actually just started following, I think somebody must have tagged me."
01:10:37;01:10:40;"I can't imagine how else it came on my radar."
01:10:40;01:10:45;"Somebody tagged me on some account that I started following called Candy Hunting."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"It's a news and media website."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"It's junk food news and some reviews."
01:10:49;01:10:53;"And as I look through it, I'm just kind of like, almost like it's too much."
01:10:53;01:10:56;"I'm literally just going to like go through their latest posts."
01:10:56;01:11:04;"This is a chip company called Clancy's that's making taquito flavored kettle chips."
01:11:05;01:11:10;"The next one is a Reese's dessert cup called Colliders."
01:11:10;01:11:14;"That's vanilla flavored dessert with Reese's crumbles."
01:11:14;01:11:22;"After that, the same chips company Clancy's is dropping a Bloody Mary and a Moscow Mule"
01:11:22;01:11:23;"flavored kettle chip."
01:11:23;01:11:27;"After that, Reese's, oh, this must be what I got tagged."
01:11:27;01:11:33;"Reese's is dropping a new big cup, peanut butter cup that has pretzels inside the peanut"
01:11:33;01:11:37;"butter. There's also a potato chip Reese's."
01:11:37;01:11:40;"There's a gingerbread flavored Oreos."
01:11:40;01:11:42;"There's Cajun fries Pringles."
01:11:42;01:11:45;"There's pumpkin spice latte M&Ms."
01:11:45;01:11:47;"They already had pumpkin spice M&Ms."
01:11:47;01:11:49;"Now there's pumpkin spice latte M&Ms."
01:11:49;01:11:50;"-Latte?"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"-Basically what I'm saying is like, it's endless."
01:11:52;01:11:56;"Like everything you can think of like, oh, there's Dunkin Donuts cereal."
01:11:56;01:11:58;"Did you guys know about this?"
01:11:58;01:12:02;"One flavor is caramel macchiato and the other flavor is mocha latte."
01:12:02;01:12:05;"On the front of the box, it says made with Dunkin coffee."
01:12:05;01:12:07;"-What's the target audience for that?"
01:12:07;01:12:08;"-35 year olds."
01:12:08;01:12:15;"-A 35 year old man children who like, I still like to eat really sugary cereal in the morning,"
01:12:15;01:12:16;"but I'm an adult."
01:12:16;01:12:17;"I also need my cup of coffee."
01:12:17;01:12:22;"If you can tell me that this cereal is made with actual Dunkin coffee, you're going to"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"save me time."
01:12:23;01:12:28;"In my day, I'll scarf down a huge ball of caramel macchiato Dunkin cereal."
01:12:28;01:12:33;"I don't, then I don't need to stop at Dunkin to get the coffee and I'm ready to go."
01:12:33;01:12:38;"Anyway, so there's these endless collaborations and weird flavors and bizarre junk food."
01:12:38;01:12:43;"And actually, even as we start to talk about it, I'm unsure if I even totally remember."
01:12:43;01:12:50;"What we saw announced was a Mountain Dew margarita, which of course is insane because I know people"
01:12:50;01:12:54;"haven't heard the new Mountain Brews song, Worst Margarita in My Life Yet, but if you've"
01:12:54;01:12:57;"been listening to the show, you followed at least partially the genesis of it."
01:12:57;01:13:01;"And I think we did, we actually read through the lyrics on the show."
01:13:01;01:13:03;"And so I know this song very well."
01:13:03;01:13:05;"I've been listening to the demo a lot."
01:13:05;01:13:08;"I think it's definitely, it's a top three Brews song."
01:13:08;01:13:13;"I think long-term, it might be tied with the song Mountain Brews for like most iconic Brews"
01:13:13;01:13:13;"tune."
01:13:13;01:13:15;"Is that the feedback you're getting, Jake?"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"Uh, I think it's a little early to say."
01:13:17;01:13:20;"Mountain Brews, the song was just a runaway hit."
01:13:20;01:13:23;"So, I want to see what the people have to say."
01:13:23;01:13:27;"But you and Danielle adding your vocal magic is not going to hurt."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"To Worst Margarita."
01:13:28;01:13:28;"Yeah."
01:13:28;01:13:29;"Hopefully."
01:13:29;01:13:31;"Proud to be a part of it."
01:13:31;01:13:37;"Anyway, there's a line in Worst Margarita of My Life where the narrator, the Jake character,"
01:13:37;01:13:42;"sips the margarita and realizes how terrible it is and says, ""I swear it was flat Mountain"
01:13:42;01:13:45;"Dew mixed with tequila for a noxious brew."""
01:13:45;01:13:49;"So, I've been listening to the song for like a couple months now."
01:13:49;01:13:54;"And then to see they're announced a Mountain Dew, Dewgarita with Saigo."
01:13:54;01:13:56;"And this is where I get confused."
01:13:56;01:13:58;"Is this exclusively at Red Lobster?"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"Yes, this is just at Red Lobster."
01:14:00;01:14:01;"Yeah, this is on their menu."
01:14:01;01:14:04;"There's always got to be that third element these days that makes no sense."
01:14:04;01:14:10;"But it adds another layer of heaviness with TC because if you recall a few months ago,"
01:14:10;01:14:14;"I did the Red Lobster/Darden restaurant group deep dive."
01:14:14;01:14:15;"Right."
01:14:15;01:14:21;"I think if you made a map of Time Crisis and you traced times Jake talked about, Red Lobster,"
01:14:21;01:14:28;"margaritas, and Mountain Dew, and you visualized it on a pinboard and you connected the yarn,"
01:14:28;01:14:31;"it would actually form a pentagram."
01:14:31;01:14:35;"And this is the pentagram that summoned this from the dark world into existence."
01:14:35;01:14:41;"Is it possible that Time Crisis has willed a sort of like"
01:14:41;01:14:47;"tier of listeners that comes from the corporate food development and marketing world where"
01:14:47;01:14:52;"there is a dialogue now between the show and the industry?"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"Or am I giving us too much credit?"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"I feel like the turnaround is probably a little fast."
01:14:56;01:15:06;"I bet Red Lobster and Mountain Dew and PepsiCo Corporation/Frito-Lay/Darden restaurant group"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"were talking about this a year ago."
01:15:09;01:15:13;"You don't think that there's a version of at, what was the name of our"
01:15:13;01:15:15;"Millennial Mad Men?"
01:15:15;01:15:16;"Is it Drago 5?"
01:15:16;01:15:17;"Droga."
01:15:17;01:15:18;"Droga 5."
01:15:18;01:15:24;"At Droga 5, there's some Vassar grad and he's about to go into his Red Lobster meeting"
01:15:24;01:15:27;"and he has nothing planned and he's killing time."
01:15:27;01:15:29;"He's jamming some TC on the bus."
01:15:29;01:15:35;"He's jamming some TC and he's like, ""Oh my God, in the last minute, the 11th hour,"
01:15:35;01:15:36;"he's got nothing there."
01:15:36;01:15:39;"He's standing at a table in front of all of the Red Lobsters."""
01:15:39;01:15:41;"I love it."
01:15:41;01:15:45;"See, I was like, ""Randy, you've been awfully quiet the past few weeks, man."
01:15:45;01:15:46;"You are not pulling your weight here."
01:15:46;01:15:49;"Give me one reason not to fire you, man."
01:15:49;01:15:51;"Just give me a halfway decent idea."""
01:15:51;01:15:55;"And he just stammers out like, ""Mountain Dew Margarita?"
01:15:55;01:15:59;"We take some flat Mountain Dew and mix it with tequila for a noxious brew?"""
01:15:59;01:16:02;"See, I was like..."
01:16:02;01:16:07;"The worst Dewgarita."
01:16:07;01:16:12;"I mean, you can see I was just like, ""Okay, maybe I wasn't out of my goddamn mind when"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"I hired you in the first place."
01:16:14;01:16:15;"This is what I'm talking about."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"Thank you, Randy."""
01:16:16;01:16:21;"Well, also during COVID, I don't know if people are actually eating at Red Lobster,"
01:16:21;01:16:26;"so it could be totally possible that the Dewgarita is like a Travis Scott McRib short"
01:16:26;01:16:29;"situation where it doesn't actually exist."
01:16:29;01:16:30;"Right."
01:16:30;01:16:32;"Where the Dewgarita is just a concept."
01:16:32;01:16:36;"Seinfeld, how much are Dewgaritas going for on StockX right now?"
01:16:36;01:16:37;"Oh my God."
01:16:37;01:16:38;"So it's like..."
01:16:38;01:16:44;"You could probably Postmates a Dewgarita though, right?"
01:16:44;01:16:45;"Yeah, no, you could."
01:16:45;01:16:47;"Like they just put it in a styrofoam or something."
01:16:47;01:16:48;"Wasn't there like a whole..."
01:16:48;01:16:52;"Maybe the reason I did the Red Lobster history segment a few months ago was because..."
01:16:52;01:16:55;"Wasn't there like a fight around Mother's Day?"
01:16:55;01:16:55;"Yes."
01:16:55;01:16:57;"Red Lobster."
01:16:57;01:17:02;"There were a bunch of very angry, rude people who were making life a living hell for the"
01:17:02;01:17:07;"Red Lobster employees because it was taking a long time to get the food or something."
01:17:07;01:17:07;"Yeah."
01:17:07;01:17:08;"Right."
01:17:08;01:17:13;"It was all to go and people were waiting up to three or four hours for to-go orders from"
01:17:13;01:17:14;"a Red Lobster."
01:17:14;01:17:18;"Because COVID, like quarantine had just started, right?"
01:17:18;01:17:21;"So there were all these new guidelines."
01:17:21;01:17:22;"That was frustrating."
01:17:22;01:17:22;"Yeah."
01:17:23;01:17:29;"I think the Dewgarita is missing is that Jake should be the Travis Scott character in this."
01:17:29;01:17:31;"Obviously, Red Lobster is probably hurting."
01:17:31;01:17:35;"They're like, ""We need to throw some crazy ideas out there to make some waves and remind"
01:17:35;01:17:38;"people that we exist and give them a reason to come through."""
01:17:38;01:17:39;"So yeah, Dewgarita."
01:17:39;01:17:40;"Okay."
01:17:40;01:17:41;"It's a great idea."
01:17:41;01:17:42;"It got people talking."
01:17:42;01:17:43;"We're talking about it."
01:17:43;01:17:47;"Of course, I want to try it or I need to try it actually for work."
01:17:47;01:17:51;"For us on Time Crisis, it's a tax write-off, by the way, to try Dewgarita."
01:17:51;01:17:56;"But what they're missing is that personality or at least that outside brand, the Travis"
01:17:56;01:17:57;"Scott in this case."
01:17:57;01:17:58;"That's what it should be."
01:17:58;01:18:02;"When you get that email from Red Lobster, if you're on their email list, you want it"
01:18:02;01:18:06;"to start with like, ""We're teaming up with Mountain Dew, an American painter and radio"
01:18:06;01:18:11;"personality, John ""Jake"" Pullman Longstra to bring you the Dewgarita."""
01:18:11;01:18:12;"Now I'm interested."
01:18:12;01:18:13;"Now I got a lot of things floating around."
01:18:13;01:18:18;"Dewgarita on its own is just like, it doesn't have the Travis Scott magic."
01:18:18;01:18:25;"Obscure but revered American band Mountain Brews has teamed up with Red Lobster and Frito"
01:18:25;01:18:25;"Lay Corporation."
01:19:18;01:19:24;"Can I just point out that this is the first of many collaborations to come between Pepsi"
01:19:24;01:19:25;"Co and Red Lobster?"
01:19:25;01:19:27;"I'm just reading this article."
01:19:27;01:19:31;"Yeah, and there's a Business Insider article on the Dewgarita that says, ""The brands are"
01:19:31;01:19:37;"working together to co-create more 'tasty' menu items using Frito Lay and Quaker products."""
01:19:37;01:19:41;"And then there's a quote from Red Lobster's senior vice president that says, ""Red Lobster"
01:19:41;01:19:45;"is thrilled to work with Pepsi Co, not only because it has a great portfolio of brands,"
01:19:45;01:19:50;"but specifically because of the food and beverage innovation possibilities."
01:19:50;01:19:56;"The Dewgarita is the first delicious taste of the types of inspired menu items to come."""
01:19:56;01:19:58;"Have they announced any of the other ones?"
01:19:58;01:19:59;"Not yet."
01:19:59;01:20:01;"You know what I actually bet they will do?"
01:20:01;01:20:02;"I'm calling it right now."
01:20:02;01:20:05;"There will be a Flamin' Hot whatever."
01:20:06;01:20:07;"Flamin' Hot Cheddar Bay Biscuit?"
01:20:07;01:20:11;"Flamin' Red Hot Lobster?"
01:20:11;01:20:14;"No, I love the Flamin' Hot Cheddar Bay Biscuit."
01:20:14;01:20:16;"The biscuit, for sure."
01:20:16;01:20:20;"A Flamin' Hot Lobster would actually be hilarious, but I think realistically, I could see Flamin'"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"Hot Cheddar Bay Biscuits being real."
01:20:22;01:20:30;"Also, picture you're the person just working at Red Lobster part-time, and I have my very"
01:20:30;01:20:34;"brief experience working at Quiznos, so I can kind of imagine it."
01:20:34;01:20:36;"I'm sure somebody else would have a better picture of it."
01:20:36;01:20:39;"But all right, you've been working at Red Lobster for a while, you know the basics."
01:20:39;01:20:44;"There's probably seven menu items that are the top sellers, so you know what to do."
01:20:44;01:20:48;"I wonder how it works when there's some new bulls**t like the Dewgarita."
01:20:48;01:20:54;"Do they have to send out regional manager types to be like, ""Everybody, you're coming"
01:20:54;01:20:55;"in early."
01:20:55;01:20:59;"I need everybody in here 7 a.m. on Sunday because we're doing a two-hour Dewgarita"
01:20:59;01:21:00;"workshop."
01:21:00;01:21:05;"This is a real priority from corporate, and I can't have any of you knuckleheads f**king"
01:21:05;01:21:06;"up the Dewgarita."
01:21:06;01:21:08;"Cheddar Bay Biscuits, you got that dialed in."
01:21:08;01:21:10;"You know how to get those piping fresh."
01:21:10;01:21:11;"Now we're doing Flamin' Hot."
01:21:11;01:21:15;"How do I-- okay, is this the type of situation where they make a corporate video?"
01:21:15;01:21:17;"It's like, ""Hey, what's up, guys?"
01:21:17;01:21:20;"We've all been making Cheddar Bay Biscuits for years."
01:21:20;01:21:22;"Now you're telling me they gotta be Flamin' Hot?"
01:21:22;01:21:23;"How does that work?"""
01:21:23;01:21:24;"Well, here's the thing, guys."
01:21:24;01:21:25;"We create a little acronym."
01:21:25;01:21:30;"They have to teach everybody how to do the funny little-- I guess it's like a coffee"
01:21:30;01:21:31;"place."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"It's probably easy."
01:21:32;01:21:37;"You get a job at Starbucks in April, and then come late September, they're like, ""Okay,"
01:21:37;01:21:41;"by the way, now it's pumpkin spice latte time."""
01:21:41;01:21:45;"Basically, two pumps and a regular latte of this bulls**t, and you're kind of like, ""Okay,"
01:21:45;01:21:46;"got it."""
01:21:46;01:21:48;"But the Dewgarita, I wonder."
01:21:48;01:21:55;"I would say the Dewgarita and the fictionalized Flamin' Hot Cheddar Biscuit, it's all standardized"
01:21:55;01:21:55;"stuff coming--"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"We got an acronym."
01:21:57;01:22:01;"When you're in there, it is A, B, C, D. Always be Cheddar-dusted."
01:22:01;01:22:07;"Always be Cheddar-dusted."
01:22:07;01:22:09;"Like, so Jake, you think it's like--"
01:22:09;01:22:10;"It's all pre-made."
01:22:10;01:22:13;"So they want to minimize human error."
01:22:13;01:22:17;"That it's like the way that the Dewgarita works, it's probably like, ""How does the"
01:22:17;01:22:18;"Dewgarita work?"""
01:22:18;01:22:23;"It's just like the regular margarita, except instead of taking the margarita box of sludge"
01:22:23;01:22:27;"that we normally use, you're going to want to take the one that's labeled Dewgarita Sludge."
01:22:27;01:22:35;"If you put the sludge in, and it appears to be a normal margarita color, more of a yellow--"
01:22:35;01:22:36;"What color is the Dewgarita, by the way?"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"Is it blue for some reason?"
01:22:38;01:22:39;"No, no, no."
01:22:39;01:22:41;"It's your classic Gatorade lime green."
01:22:41;01:22:42;"Oh, it's green."
01:22:42;01:22:42;"Right."
01:22:42;01:22:43;"So it's not yellow."
01:22:43;01:22:50;"Is that because while Mountain Dew is yellow, the can is green?"
01:22:50;01:22:51;"Wait, now I'm actually tripping."
01:22:51;01:22:53;"What color is Mountain Dew?"
01:22:53;01:22:54;"Isn't Mountain Dew yellow?"
01:22:54;01:22:56;"It's like the same color as Gatorade."
01:22:56;01:22:58;"But its colorway is green."
01:22:58;01:22:59;"But that's what I'm saying."
01:22:59;01:23:05;"If they made it green, is it because it's more iconic to look like the plastic label?"
01:23:05;01:23:09;"The images they provide of the Dewgarita, the liquid appears to be green."
01:23:09;01:23:14;"Yeah, and as I recall, the liquid of Mountain Dew is actually like, it's green, but it's"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"not as green as the bottle."
01:23:16;01:23:17;"Is the Dewgarita available?"
01:23:17;01:23:22;"If we get on Postmates and try to order some food from the Red Lobster in Burbank,"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"is the Dewgarita on the menu?"
01:23:25;01:23:30;"I just tried to do that, and Red Lobster was out of range for me."
01:23:30;01:23:31;"So I couldn't."
01:23:31;01:23:32;"Hold on."
01:23:32;01:23:33;"Is there one in Burbank?"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"Should we try to call Red Lobster?"
01:23:35;01:23:36;"Wait, there's one in Pasadena."
01:23:36;01:23:39;"Matt, can you call the Pasadena Red Lobster?"
01:23:39;01:23:39;"Yeah, I'll try it."
01:23:39;01:23:40;"Hang on."
01:23:40;01:23:41;"I just had an idea."
01:23:41;01:23:44;"We should start our own soda called Morning Dew."
01:23:44;01:23:45;"Ooh."
01:23:45;01:23:46;"Ooh."
01:23:46;01:23:49;"I don't know what we do with it, but it's like, and they try to come for us."
01:23:49;01:23:50;"We're like, man, it's Morning Dew."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"It's like the phrase is old as time."
01:23:52;01:23:55;"You got your Mountain Dew, we got Morning Dew."
01:23:55;01:23:56;"And it's beer and Mountain Dew."
01:23:56;01:23:59;"Is it a Mountain Brews beer called Morning Dew?"
01:23:59;01:24:00;"Or that should be called Mountain Brew."
01:24:00;01:24:02;"We start two things."
01:24:02;01:24:05;"We start a soda called Morning Dew and a beer called Mountain Brew."
01:24:05;01:24:08;"I'm looking at the Red Lobster Margarita menu right now."
01:24:08;01:24:11;"No Dewgarita listed."
01:24:11;01:24:11;"Really?"
01:24:11;01:24:14;"Well, it's a little unclear where it's like, just like the Yelp."
01:24:14;01:24:15;"Oh no, no."
01:24:15;01:24:19;"It's the Pasadena Red Lobster on menu on Yelp."
01:24:19;01:24:19;"Oh yeah."
01:24:19;01:24:19;"Yelp."
01:24:19;01:24:22;"Yelp that could easily not be updated."
01:24:22;01:24:27;"The Dewgarita will be available nationwide by the end of 2020, according to a press release."
01:24:27;01:24:28;"That's vague."
01:24:28;01:24:31;"So I just called and they do not have it."
01:24:31;01:24:31;"Okay."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"They don't carry the Dewgarita."
01:24:33;01:24:34;"They don't have the Dewgarita."
01:24:34;01:24:37;"She wasn't even totally sure what it was, to be totally honest."
01:24:37;01:24:37;"All right."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"Well, there you go."
01:24:38;01:24:40;"It's going to take them a while."
01:24:40;01:24:44;"I mean, that's why you need really efficient corporate structure."
01:24:44;01:24:47;"I mean, they shouldn't be advertising until it's actually available."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"Because that kind of stuff."
01:24:49;01:24:49;"Yeah."
01:24:49;01:24:50;"They just want to make a splash."
01:24:50;01:24:52;"They just want to make a splash."
01:24:52;01:24:56;"I wonder if there's any, how it's worked out with McDonald's."
01:24:56;01:25:00;"If there's anywhere in the country, like some really rural McDonald's where somebody"
01:25:00;01:25:04;"rolled up and was like, I'd like the Travis Scott meal Cactus Jack sent me."
01:25:04;01:25:07;"And they're just like, what the did you just say?"
01:25:07;01:25:08;"They're like, I want the Travis Scott meal."
01:25:08;01:25:11;"And they're like, I have no idea what you're talking about."
01:25:11;01:25:12;"What do you want?"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"I want the Travis Scott meal."
01:25:13;01:25:15;"And they're like, sir, what do you want?"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"He's like, okay, I want a Sprite and a quarter."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"They're like, all right, thank you."
01:25:18;01:25:20;"Like they literally never heard of it."
01:25:20;01:25:24;"Or is McDonald's so dialed in that they everybody knows."
01:25:24;01:25:26;"I think it's possible that there's some McDonald's"
01:25:26;01:25:30;"in out of the way places that are not dialed in yet."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"I mean, because there's so many McDonald's."
01:25:32;01:25:33;"Well, here's a question."
01:25:33;01:25:37;"Is the Travis Scott meal a global initiative or is it America only?"
01:25:37;01:25:44;"Because you roll up a Ukrainian McDonald's and be like, give me the Travis Scott."
01:25:44;01:25:47;"Or is it like a regional version of the Travis Scott?"
01:25:47;01:25:51;"Well, also, yeah, McDonald's menus are very different around the world."
01:25:51;01:25:56;"Like famously in India, most Indian McDonald's, I think, don't actually have beef."
01:25:56;01:25:58;"Sure."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"So you could imagine that it could be problematic"
01:26:00;01:26:03;"trying to figure out this Travis Scott meal globally."
01:26:03;01:26:06;"The worst do go read."
01:26:06;01:26:12;"That song is specifically about somebody who actually loves do go read us."
01:26:12;01:26:17;"They just happen to be at one Red Lobster that didn't have it dialed in yet."
01:26:17;01:26:20;"I've had many do go read us and this one is not good."
01:26:20;01:26:27;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:26:27;01:26:29;"This week on the top five."
01:26:29;01:26:31;"Jake, why don't you explain this?"
01:26:31;01:26:35;"You made an executive decision to do something kind of special."
01:26:35;01:26:39;"Well, speaking of the do go read a friend of the show, Daniel Ralston,"
01:26:40;01:26:45;"sent me a song, a new Luke Bryan song today called One Margarita."
01:26:45;01:26:49;"And it's just about a dude dudes on a boat,"
01:26:49;01:26:52;"like getting hammered on a boat, drinking margaritas and doing shots."
01:26:52;01:26:55;"And the song's called One Margarita."
01:26:55;01:26:55;"Yeah."
01:26:55;01:27:00;"One Margarita, two Margarita, three Margarita shot."
01:27:00;01:27:00;"OK."
01:27:00;01:27:04;"And something something something something something on the floating dock."
01:27:04;01:27:06;"It's a great song."
01:27:06;01:27:08;"It's really not that far from a Mountain Brew song."
01:27:09;01:27:11;"And then we were just like texting back and forth today and he's like,"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"dude, what if you did like a country top five?"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"And I was like, that's kind of a tight call."
01:27:15;01:27:17;"OK, shout out Daniel Ralston."
01:27:17;01:27:19;"That's a great call."
01:27:19;01:27:21;"I was like, yeah, contemporary country top five."
01:27:21;01:27:22;"I mean, why not?"
01:27:22;01:27:23;"Yeah."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"Sometimes we get country in the top five."
01:27:25;01:27:26;"But yeah, we ought to go."
01:27:26;01:27:28;"Can we just real fast throw on Luke Bryan, One Margarita, though?"
01:27:28;01:27:38;"Heavy auto tune on this, by the way."
01:27:38;01:27:43;"Everybody here ain't from here, but we're here doing our thing."
01:27:43;01:27:49;"Letting go a little, little by little, sipping on a frozen drink."
01:27:49;01:27:54;"Tiki bars taking pouring all week and clouds ain't leaking no rain."
01:27:54;01:27:58;"Two pieces shaking, white caps breaking."
01:27:58;01:28:00;"We ain't feeling no pain."
01:28:00;01:28:05;"It goes like one margarita, two margarita, three margarita shot."
01:28:05;01:28:10;"Don't worry about tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floating dock."
01:28:10;01:28:17;"When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way."
01:28:17;01:28:22;"One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say,"
01:28:22;01:28:26;"hey, senorita, don't you think we need a Saltana Buffett song?"
01:28:26;01:28:33;"One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone."
01:28:33;01:28:34;"We'll be gone."
01:28:34;01:28:42;"Ice blue sky shades on the ice that took the bloodshot away."
01:28:42;01:28:47;"Hair of the dog shouldn't take long, but who cares, we got all day."
01:28:47;01:28:53;"Palm trees are lean and sunburns screaming, but we'll all be all right."
01:28:53;01:28:58;"After one margarita, two margarita, three margarita shot."
01:28:58;01:29:03;"Don't worry about tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floating dock."
01:29:04;01:29:08;"This might be a naive question, but what's the implication of a floating dock?"
01:29:08;01:29:13;"I think you're getting into like a technical analysis of like kind of boating and lake culture."
01:29:13;01:29:19;"Obviously, I'm not Southern. In my heart, I feel country, but I'm not country."
01:29:19;01:29:22;"You know, some people are country, country people."
01:29:22;01:29:25;"Obviously, there's lakes all over this fine nation of ours."
01:29:25;01:29:30;"There's lakes in New England. Of course, there's the lakes in Minnesota."
01:29:31;01:29:36;"There's a thousand lakes, but there's something specific about like kind of country"
01:29:36;01:29:41;"lake culture where you go get sh*t faced at the lake."
01:29:41;01:29:47;"Well, yeah, even this year, the idea of kind of like red state lake culture"
01:29:47;01:29:54;"has been the object of derision from coastal liberals with the lake of the Ozarks."
01:29:54;01:29:57;"Everybody going there at the height of COVID, people being like,"
01:29:57;01:30:01;"""Oh my God, this is why America is falling apart. You should have been wearing masks."""
01:30:01;01:30:05;"And then also there was that Trump boat parade on a lake somewhere, right?"
01:30:05;01:30:06;"Was that Lake Havasu?"
01:30:06;01:30:10;"Yeah, I think so. But also Trump loves to talk about his beautiful boaters."
01:30:10;01:30:15;"Literally use the term beautiful boaters."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"Boaters."
01:30:17;01:30:18;"His boater votes."
01:30:18;01:30:24;"So the country is surrounded by water. So there's coasts and boats and everywhere."
01:30:24;01:30:28;"There's lakes everywhere, but getting sh*t faced down at the lake."
01:30:28;01:30:30;"I guess that's why I asked about the floating dock."
01:30:30;01:30:32;"Is that like somehow like a country thing?"
01:30:32;01:30:36;"Well, yeah, I'm also not a boat person. So I was wondering about that too."
01:30:36;01:30:40;"Like, did he mean like the sort of like classic dock that was like"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"offshore that you could like swim to?"
01:30:42;01:30:45;"Or does he just mean a dock that's actually moored to the shore?"
01:30:45;01:30:48;"No, you get sort of a catwalk out."
01:30:48;01:30:49;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:30:49;01:30:52;"And it's sort of a square dock that is anchored in."
01:30:52;01:30:56;"So it's floating and you basically go hang there, go tubing."
01:30:57;01:31:00;"You go get a, you know, a lounge chair."
01:31:00;01:31:02;"It's attached to the regular dock?"
01:31:02;01:31:05;"Yes, but it's usually like floating in from like a lake."
01:31:05;01:31:09;"You know, if you have a house on a lake and you go and get a little catwalk out."
01:31:09;01:31:12;"And then, yeah, you'll probably tie your your boats or your,"
01:31:12;01:31:14;"you know, canoes or whatever to that."
01:31:14;01:31:17;"But it is sort of a square. You can picture it."
01:31:17;01:31:21;"Now, I understand what you're saying, because old school docks would have been actually like"
01:31:21;01:31:26;"there would have been footers into the actual ground at the bottom of the lake."
01:31:26;01:31:28;"You know, like an old wooden dock."
01:31:28;01:31:34;"There'd be like fence posts driven down into the mud at the lake's bottom."
01:31:34;01:31:41;"Does that kind of dock imply more of like an old money genteel New England waspy kind of lake?"
01:31:41;01:31:46;"And the floating dock implies more of a kind of Kenny Powers,"
01:31:46;01:31:47;"like let's get a **** face vibe?"
01:31:47;01:31:52;"Right. Some sort of like, yeah, like dock with like a flotation under the deck."
01:31:52;01:31:55;"By the way, guys, I'm actually thinking this might be"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"because that is a floating dock what we're talking about."
01:31:57;01:32:00;"But when I look it up now, I'm actually seeing these sort of"
01:32:00;01:32:08;"very large square inflatable docks, I guess, where they would go out on the lake"
01:32:08;01:32:11;"and you'd put your chairs on them sort of like floaties."
01:32:11;01:32:13;"Like you're in the middle of the lake."
01:32:13;01:32:17;"Like you're in the middle of the lake on a giant inflatable square."
01:32:17;01:32:18;"So you like swim out there."
01:32:18;01:32:23;"Yeah, you'd swim out there or you'd literally sit on chairs, get sort of pushed out."
01:32:23;01:32:26;"And now you're floating on and in your chairs with your igloo"
01:32:26;01:32:30;"and you're just drinking beer, hopping off and getting on."
01:32:30;01:32:34;"I guess it's, you know, I mean, it's what I'm looking at."
01:32:34;01:32:35;"I've never seen before."
01:32:35;01:32:38;"And it looks fun."
01:32:38;01:32:40;"I think Luke Bryan is talking about sort of"
01:32:40;01:32:43;"newer dock technology that we're not hip to."
01:32:43;01:32:45;"Yes."
01:32:45;01:32:50;"I know that there's a, well, it's not a lake, but I know we played at the festival called"
01:32:50;01:32:51;"Hangout in Alabama."
01:32:51;01:32:55;"That was actually a time where we played right before Travis Scott, matter of fact."
01:32:55;01:32:56;"And that's a great festival."
01:32:56;01:33:03;"It's like right on the beach and the area of Alabama and I guess also the Florida panhandle."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"I remember we flew in and out of Pensacola."
01:33:05;01:33:09;"People referred to it as the Redneck Riviera."
01:33:09;01:33:10;"Right."
01:33:10;01:33:15;"So I guess maybe is there a, I'm truly grasping in the dark here, but I wonder if this is"
01:33:15;01:33:20;"a thing where there's like some like old school lake in Connecticut where there's like these"
01:33:20;01:33:25;"like beautiful stately old homes and everybody has like their, you know, classic docks and"
01:33:25;01:33:31;"like, you know, some new money, family moves in and they kind of like go to all the neighborhood"
01:33:31;01:33:37;"lake association like, ""Hey guys, we should get a floating dock in the middle of the lake."
01:33:37;01:33:37;"Hey, you know what?"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"We'll even foot the bill."
01:33:39;01:33:40;"We could all party there."
01:33:40;01:33:42;"It's something fun for the whole neighborhood."""
01:33:42;01:33:46;"And people are just like, ""Sir, this is Connecticut."
01:33:46;01:33:48;"We will never have a floating dock."
01:33:48;01:33:54;"Our docks are made out of wood and they have poles that go down to the bottom of the lake."
01:33:54;01:34:00;"And yes, we might, you know, toss back a few martinis there, but we will certainly never"
01:34:00;01:34:04;"float on a dock to the middle of the lake and drink three margaritas in a shot."""
01:34:04;01:34:06;"Is this a dichotomy that exists?"
01:34:06;01:34:10;"I mean, it depends on what part of Connecticut you're in because there's definitely redneck"
01:34:10;01:34:14;"parts of Connecticut and then there's definitely the hoity-toity parts of CT."
01:34:14;01:34:15;"Right."
01:34:15;01:34:20;"That's the big secret of America is that there's stuck up old money, rich people and"
01:34:20;01:34:24;"rednecks literally everywhere."
01:34:24;01:34:25;"It's not a North versus South thing."
01:34:25;01:34:26;"No."
01:34:26;01:34:28;"So we've been jawboning for a while."
01:34:28;01:34:33;"So what we're going to do right now, rather than do a comparison, we're going to get into"
01:34:33;01:34:38;"the top five country songs on the country streaming charts."
01:34:38;01:34:44;"And that means that it's not necessarily the newest ones because with streaming, you get"
01:34:44;01:34:45;"all sorts of stuff."
01:34:45;01:34:47;"So actually, interestingly, let's kick it off with number five."
01:34:47;01:34:53;"The number five most streamed country song this week, Chris Stapleton, Tennessee Whiskey."
01:34:53;01:34:55;"This song came out in 2015."
01:34:55;01:34:58;"So Chris Stapleton really doing his damn thing."
01:34:59;01:35:03;"I feel like we heard this song when we first started Time Crisis."
01:35:03;01:35:05;"You know, was it a Stapleton, Jake?"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"Yeah, I'm aware."
01:35:07;01:35:09;"Oh, I guess this is an old song."
01:35:09;01:35:10;"It was written in 1981."
01:35:10;01:35:19;"It was first recorded by American country artist David Allen Coe."
01:35:19;01:35:21;"Famous bad boy of country."
01:35:21;01:35:25;"Well, his son is the guy that hosts Cocaine and Rhinestones."
01:35:25;01:35:26;"Oh, really?"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"Did you ever check out that podcast?"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"No, I remember you talking about it."
01:35:30;01:35:31;"It's really good."
01:35:31;01:35:35;"And his son is, yeah, I think his name is Tyler Coe."
01:35:35;01:35:39;"Very opinionated on Twitter, too, about country music."
01:35:39;01:35:39;"Yeah."
01:35:39;01:35:42;"Not a fan of Luke Bryan, incidentally."
01:35:42;01:35:43;"Oh, really?"
01:35:43;01:35:57;"So I wonder why this song is still five years later, like on the top five."
01:35:57;01:36:02;"Yeah, I mean, I remember hearing this song back in the day and I was struck by like,"
01:36:02;01:36:05;"OK, Chris Stapleton, I think people like him because he's like,"
01:36:05;01:36:08;"he feels like throwback in a sense."
01:36:08;01:36:09;"Yeah."
01:36:09;01:36:12;"You know, this song doesn't actually sound like old country to me."
01:36:12;01:36:14;"It sounds like old R&B."
01:36:14;01:36:15;"Right."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"But I mean, he's got a very, he's a great singer."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"He sings his ass off."
01:36:19;01:36:21;"And I think his, you know, he's got like a big beard."
01:36:21;01:36:24;"And I think he's seen as kind of like an antidote to Luke Bryan stuff."
01:36:24;01:36:25;"Yeah."
01:36:25;01:36:29;"It's actually interesting to compare this song to One Margarita."
01:36:29;01:36:33;"Even just the what he's referencing, you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey."
01:36:33;01:36:39;"Tennessee whiskey is like old school, old America, old South versus margaritas."
01:36:39;01:36:42;"Even when I wonder if I want to get like a graph that"
01:36:42;01:36:45;"tracks margaritas and country music over time."
01:36:45;01:36:45;"Yeah."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"What are you going to say, Jake?"
01:36:46;01:36:52;"I was going to say even in 1981, this song when it was written was decidedly retro."
01:36:52;01:36:55;"You know, you're as sweet as strawberry wine."
01:36:55;01:36:57;"But back to your question, it's sort of like,"
01:36:57;01:37:00;"what was the first country song that referenced a margarita?"
01:37:00;01:37:00;"Yeah."
01:37:00;01:37:04;"And because I think Jimmy Buffett, you know, his music is definitely country influence."
01:37:04;01:37:06;"But when he's singing about margaritas in the 70s,"
01:37:06;01:37:11;"he was probably seen as some kind of more of this like fun singer songwriter guy."
01:37:11;01:37:15;"Whereas like Luke Bryan is decidedly a country artist."
01:37:15;01:37:16;"That's his world."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"Yes."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"Yeah."
01:37:18;01:37:23;"I wonder if like margaritas back then just didn't read as like a real like country drink."
01:37:23;01:37:27;"I'm going to do a little deep digging, but I have to think that those Texas country"
01:37:27;01:37:31;"artists like Waylon Jennings and everyone would have talked about,"
01:37:31;01:37:33;"you know, you're in border town."
01:37:33;01:37:34;"There has to be something."
01:37:34;01:37:34;"No."
01:37:34;01:37:35;"I know."
01:37:35;01:37:39;"Definitely maybe referencing tequila, but not margarita."
01:37:39;01:37:46;"There's some of that like left of center, smaller name, Austin, Texas based country stuff."
01:37:46;01:37:47;"Like what's that guy's name?"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"Like Jerry Jeff James or something."
01:37:49;01:37:50;"Oh, Jerry Jeff Walker."
01:37:51;01:37:58;"I feel like there was a time where he lived in Austin and there was like a scene of these"
01:37:58;01:37:59;"country guys."
01:37:59;01:38:02;"And I kind of remember one of them having this song about like,"
01:38:02;01:38:05;"there's like a famous bar in Austin where they think they have something called like"
01:38:05;01:38:06;"Mad Dog Margaritas."
01:38:06;01:38:08;"Oh, yeah."
01:38:08;01:38:15;"There's a bar in Austin called Texas Chili Parlor, and they serve something called a Mad Dog Margarita."
01:38:15;01:38:19;"And Guy Clark wrote a song about that."
01:38:19;01:38:20;"But that was like in the 90s."
01:38:20;01:38:23;"I think Guy Clark is kind of like a real writer's writer."
01:38:23;01:38:24;"Yeah."
01:38:24;01:38:29;"Like a Rodney Crowell or like a Townes Van Zandt or like."
01:38:29;01:38:29;"Yeah, exactly."
01:38:29;01:38:34;"He probably actually would have maybe had a drink with Townes Van Zandt in like 1979 or"
01:38:34;01:38:35;"something."
01:38:35;01:38:38;"And he has a song where he references Mad Dog Margaritas."
01:38:38;01:38:43;"But even again, it's like, I don't think you could call him like a mainstream country act"
01:38:43;01:38:44;"like Luke Bryan."
01:38:44;01:38:46;"Do you know the history of the margarita?"
01:38:46;01:38:46;"No."
01:38:46;01:38:49;"Does it actually come from Mexico?"
01:38:49;01:38:55;"Yeah, one of the earliest stories is the margarita being invented in 1938 by Carlos Danny Herrera"
01:38:55;01:39:03;"at his restaurant Rancho La Gloria, halfway between Tijuana and Rosarito, Baja, California."
01:39:03;01:39:10;"Created for the customer and former Ziegfeld dancer Marjorie King, who was allergic to many"
01:39:10;01:39:11;"spirits, but not tequila."
01:39:11;01:39:13;"Margaritas are a great drink."
01:39:13;01:39:15;"Wait, did we talk about this last time, Jake?"
01:39:15;01:39:16;"You don't actually like margaritas?"
01:39:16;01:39:17;"Is that part of the story?"
01:39:18;01:39:19;"No, that's not true."
01:39:19;01:39:22;"I'm actually sort of having one right now."
01:39:22;01:39:23;"Really?"
01:39:23;01:39:24;"You just made your own?"
01:39:24;01:39:29;"I'm kind of in my own, just mezcal and lime and a little like simple syrup."
01:39:29;01:39:30;"I mean, it's basically a margarita."
01:39:30;01:39:33;"It's just a very simple, you know, I like margaritas."
01:39:33;01:39:35;"I just don't like them when they're too sweet."
01:39:35;01:39:38;"And obviously, the whole debacle at Donnie Stadium."
01:39:38;01:39:40;"Yeah, right."
01:39:40;01:39:40;"Fair."
01:39:40;01:39:41;"Here's a question."
01:39:41;01:39:47;"How do you think I could get, once we finally record and release Worst Margarita of My Life,"
01:39:48;01:39:51;"I want to get it to Luke Bryan and see if he would record it."
01:39:51;01:39:52;"Whoa, that's a great idea."
01:39:52;01:39:54;"Just have it cross his desk."
01:39:54;01:39:58;"I guarantee you I could get it to cross at least his manager's desk."
01:39:58;01:39:59;"All right."
01:39:59;01:40:01;"Wait, now that I'm thinking about it, in Worst Margarita of My Life,"
01:40:01;01:40:05;"you don't actually specify that you're at Dodger Stadium, right?"
01:40:05;01:40:06;"No."
01:40:06;01:40:09;"Okay, that's good, because I could picture you get it to some country dude,"
01:40:09;01:40:10;"and he's like, ""What is this L.A. s***?"""
01:40:10;01:40:15;"But anybody could relate to going to a ball game and getting a s***ty margarita,"
01:40:15;01:40:19;"getting taken advantage of by a team that doesn't give a s*** about the fans."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"All right, we might have to cast a wide net."
01:40:21;01:40:24;"If Luke Bryan passes, we should have some backups."
01:40:24;01:40:27;"I think this is going to be a fun, ongoing project for TC."
01:40:27;01:40:31;"Get it covered by a contemporary country artist."
01:40:31;01:40:33;"Who's the ""Body Like a Backroad"" guy?"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"Yeah, he'd be a good choice."
01:40:35;01:40:38;"I thought that was Florida, Georgia."
01:40:38;01:40:39;"No, but they'd be a good one."
01:40:39;01:40:42;"""Body Like a Backroad"" is Shane Carruthers."
01:40:42;01:40:44;"Nope."
01:40:45;01:40:45;"Sam Hunt."
01:40:45;01:40:47;"Sam Hunt, Matt said."
01:40:47;01:40:49;"Sam Hunt."
01:40:49;01:40:51;"Travis Scott, the country one, not the rapper one."
01:40:51;01:40:53;"That'd be amazing."
01:40:53;01:40:56;"Hi, my name is Travis Scott, not the rapper, the country one."
01:40:56;01:40:58;"And this is my new song, ""The Worst Margarita in My Life."""
01:40:58;01:41:00;"But you know what, Jake?"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"Actually, I don't think it's that crazy."
01:41:02;01:41:08;"I feel like Jimmy Buffett is actually always looking for new songs to add to his show."
01:41:08;01:41:08;"Oh, wow."
01:41:08;01:41:11;"I think I could get it to Jimmy Buffett and just be like,"
01:41:11;01:41:14;"""Listen, man, maybe you feel you got enough margarita songs,"
01:41:14;01:41:17;"but this is a real good one by an American painter, radio personality,"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"and musician, Jake Longstreth."""
01:41:19;01:41:22;"I could picture him being like, ""Man, I like this song."
01:41:22;01:41:23;"Let me throw it in the set."""
01:41:23;01:41:26;"Because I've gone deep on Jimmy Buffett's set list in the past."
01:41:26;01:41:28;"And it's like, he obviously plays the hits,"
01:41:28;01:41:30;"but he likes to mix things up and do some covers."
01:41:30;01:41:35;"I feel like Jimmy Buffett definitely would drop a ""KoKoMo"" here and there."
01:41:35;01:41:38;"Or he might come across a fun song that he thinks his fans might like"
01:41:38;01:41:40;"and play it on a summer tour."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"I really don't think that's crazy."
01:41:42;01:41:45;"I'd love to hear an auto-tuned version of it."
01:41:45;01:41:46;"We're going to make this happen."
01:41:46;01:41:48;"Yeah. Okay. Ongoing TC project."
01:41:48;01:41:54;"Okay. So the number four song is Morgan Wallen with the song ""Seven Summers."""
01:41:54;01:41:58;"And actually, I think Morgan Wallen just had a hit with Diplo."
01:41:58;01:42:00;"See if you like the timbre of this guy's voice, Jake,"
01:42:00;01:42:04;"because I could pass the song at Diplo and see if you get it to Morgan Wallen."
01:42:09;01:42:15;"Whoa. This feels like we're listening to another classic 1978 top five."
01:42:15;01:42:16;"Yeah."
01:42:16;01:42:19;"I'm waiting for like a Gibb brother to come in."
01:42:19;01:42:21;"Yeah."
01:43:10;01:43:17;"Pretty eagles."
01:43:17;01:43:19;"Yeah. This is a cool vibe."
01:43:19;01:43:20;"I'm digging it."
01:43:20;01:43:22;"Throwback, kind of dreamy 70s."
01:43:40;01:43:42;"I'm into this song."
01:43:42;01:43:45;"I think he's a great contender for ""Worst Margarita of My Life."""
01:43:45;01:43:45;"Yeah."
01:43:45;01:43:46;"Yeah."
01:43:46;01:43:50;"I mean, he's singing about six packs and Southern Comfort."
01:43:50;01:43:53;"""Seven Summers"" is a great title, by the way."
01:43:53;01:43:58;"This guy should cover ""Worst Margarita,"" and Mac DeMarco should cover this song."
01:43:58;01:44:02;"And Mac DeMarco should..."
01:44:02;01:44:02;"I could just..."
01:44:02;01:44:04;"Totally."
01:44:04;01:44:10;"Well, I've noticed something is that in this song,"
01:44:10;01:44:13;"he's talking about back then you used to love the river."
01:44:13;01:44:16;"Obviously, I'm talking out of my ass a lot, but there's something about"
01:44:16;01:44:20;"country and water that I don't fully understand."
01:44:20;01:44:25;"So I want to understand because there's a lot of lakes and rivers in country music."
01:44:25;01:44:28;"I feel like in country music, people are always going down and jumping the river and sh*t."
01:44:28;01:44:30;"Which may be the hardest part."
01:44:30;01:44:32;"It's not that hard to understand."
01:44:32;01:44:34;"It is so hot in the South."
01:44:34;01:44:35;"That you got to jump in the river."
01:44:35;01:44:37;"The summers are brutal."
01:44:37;01:44:41;"That when you're by a body of water, a lake or a river, you get in."
01:44:41;01:44:42;"What do you think it means?"
01:44:42;01:44:46;"In this song, he's implying that he's a little bit from the wrong side of the tracks."
01:44:46;01:44:48;"And this is his former love."
01:44:48;01:44:50;"Seven summers ago, they were together."
01:44:50;01:44:52;"Their lives diverged."
01:44:52;01:44:56;"And he's saying, ""I bet your dad is so happy you didn't end up with me."""
01:44:56;01:45:00;"And kind of implying that maybe she's from a more upper-crust background or something."
01:45:00;01:45:01;"Or he's just a bad boy."
01:45:01;01:45:05;"And when he says, ""You probably got a big old diamond on your hand right now."""
01:45:05;01:45:08;"That kind of implies, ""You probably ended up with a country club dude."
01:45:08;01:45:10;"Rich guy."""
01:45:10;01:45:12;"Whereas I'm just a good old boy."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"So he's talking about the past."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"And he says, ""Back then, you used to love the river."""
01:45:16;01:45:18;"Maybe he's just trying to--"
01:45:18;01:45:25;"No, I think back then, before she was fine slumming it with a river rat."
01:45:25;01:45:27;"Right."
01:45:27;01:45:29;"Well, I guess that's what my question is."
01:45:29;01:45:34;"People who jump in the river, that implies that they're from the wrong side of the tracks."
01:45:34;01:45:36;"You're a river rat if you jump in the river."
01:45:36;01:45:39;"You don't have access to the country clubs in-ground pool."
01:45:39;01:45:40;"Right."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"Yeah."
01:45:42;01:45:50;"You're on a floating dock, hopping in a river, parked up outside in your truck with a sixer."
01:45:50;01:45:53;"And it's just a different-- yeah, it's not the country club vibe."
01:45:53;01:45:55;"So back then, she was OK with the river."
01:45:55;01:45:59;"Now she's probably got a private pool."
01:45:59;01:46:00;"You're married to a lawyer."
01:46:00;01:46:03;"He'll probably be a judge one day."
01:46:03;01:46:05;"And you guys go to the country club."
01:46:05;01:46:14;"And you wouldn't be caught dead wearing a pair of jean shorts in an inner tube on the river with me."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"That's sad."
01:46:15;01:46:20;"Any time a country song mentions a sixer, they should just make it a 12er."
01:46:20;01:46:25;"Because a sixer is just going to be gone."
01:46:25;01:46:27;"If there's two or three people--"
01:46:27;01:46:30;"I mean, if there's three people, that's two beers each."
01:46:30;01:46:33;"That sixer is gone in 20 minutes, half hour."
01:46:33;01:46:36;"Yeah, but sixer rhymes with more stuff, like river."
01:46:36;01:46:37;"12?"
01:46:37;01:46:38;"It ends with ""er."""
01:46:38;01:46:46;"I also feel like, truthfully, if you're into drinking, we're talking 18 or 24 packs most of the time."
01:46:46;01:46:47;"Yeah."
01:46:47;01:46:50;"You might as well go for two 18s and a 36er."
01:46:50;01:46:51;"That's if you're rolling with a crew."
01:46:51;01:46:53;"Right."
01:46:53;01:46:58;"But I'm saying, if you're rolling with two, three, four people, you're bringing a 12."
01:46:58;01:47:03;"The number three song right now of the global streaming country whatever--"
01:47:03;01:47:05;"Global streaming country."
01:47:05;01:47:08;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:47:08;01:47:11;"--is Lee Bryce, ""One of Them Girls."""
01:47:11;01:47:13;"Hi, I'm Lee Bryce."
01:47:13;01:47:14;"And I'm Travis Scott."
01:47:14;01:47:16;"This is our new song, ""One of Them Girls."""
01:47:20;01:47:24;"Oh, dude, this last paragraph of these notes is awesome."
01:47:24;01:47:31;"Lee, who's a father of three, called an emergency songwriting session with co-writers Ashley Gorley,"
01:47:31;01:47:37;"Dallas Davidson, and Ben Johnson at 2 o'clock in the morning in order to bring the track to life."
01:47:37;01:47:37;"Just like--"
01:47:37;01:47:39;"What does that mean?"
01:47:39;01:47:41;"To write it or to punch it up?"
01:47:41;01:47:43;"Probably they're in the studio."
01:47:43;01:47:47;"Dude, you're working on the new ""Vampire"" at 2 in the morning with Ariel."
01:47:47;01:47:49;"My phone starts going off."
01:47:49;01:47:50;"Jake, get down here."
01:47:54;01:47:55;"I kind of missed the opening line."
01:47:55;01:48:01;"The opening line of the song is, ""Are you one of them girls that peels off the Bud Light label?"""
01:48:01;01:48:05;"Without looking at the rest of the song, if somebody was talking about, like, you know,"
01:48:05;01:48:09;"the type of girl that peels off the Bud Light label, what's the first thing that comes to mind?"
01:48:09;01:48:12;"What do you think that implies about a woman?"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"I don't know what that means."
01:48:14;01:48:15;"That is mystifying."
01:48:15;01:48:17;"Anxiety, right?"
01:48:17;01:48:18;"No."
01:48:18;01:48:19;"Yeah."
01:48:19;01:48:20;"No, that's what I was thinking."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"You think that's what it means?"
01:48:21;01:48:22;"Like, fidgeting."
01:48:22;01:48:23;"It's like a nervous twitch."
01:48:23;01:48:29;"I mean, I feel like I usually, on a wet beer, I'll usually, like, f*** with the label."
01:48:29;01:48:30;"I don't peel it off and, like--"
01:48:30;01:48:31;"I guess it also depends."
01:48:31;01:48:34;"I'll probably, like, little by little, like, you know, squish it."
01:48:34;01:48:39;"I guess I can picture, like, somebody who peels it off, like, perfectly,"
01:48:39;01:48:42;"and then I don't know what you do with it next."
01:48:42;01:48:45;"Make it as, like, a temporary sticker?"
01:48:45;01:48:45;"Yeah."
01:48:46;01:48:49;"Does that imply that she's, like, a cool-ass girl?"
01:48:49;01:48:52;"Because are you one of those girls that peels off the Bud Light label,"
01:48:52;01:48:56;"just might run a pool table, roll your eyes if I call you an angel?"
01:48:56;01:48:59;"Ain't you one of them girls that I ask you to dance, you say no?"
01:48:59;01:48:59;"I'm telling you no."
01:48:59;01:49:01;"No, this is about peeling off--"
01:49:01;01:49:03;"It's like she's a cool guy's girl."
01:49:03;01:49:04;"Like a tomboy?"
01:49:04;01:49:06;"Yeah, like a tomboy."
01:49:06;01:49:09;"That she wants you thinking that she's drinking a normal Bud,"
01:49:09;01:49:14;"and that she's not, like, a lady that cares about having a clean light."
01:49:14;01:49:14;"So she--"
01:49:14;01:49:15;"Wow."
01:49:15;01:49:18;"She's one of the guys."
01:49:18;01:49:19;"She's drinking a Bud Heavy."
01:49:19;01:49:20;"Yeah."
01:49:20;01:49:22;"Oh, that's deep."
01:49:22;01:49:24;"Okay. Oh, interesting."
01:49:24;01:49:29;"Although I gotta tell you, because I'll pull the labels off of, like,"
01:49:29;01:49:31;"sort of a wet beer out of being nervous."
01:49:31;01:49:36;"I think that we're the only people that would ever read being nervous."
01:49:36;01:49:39;"That's, like, a very Seinfeldian read to the whole thing."
01:49:39;01:49:39;"There's no--"
01:49:39;01:49:41;"Peels off the Bud Light label."
01:49:42;01:49:45;"Oh, I'm at this, like, weird industry event at the Chateau Marmont,"
01:49:45;01:49:49;"and there's a famous director across the room I want to talk to."
01:49:49;01:49:52;"I'm nervously peeling the label off the beer."
01:49:52;01:49:56;"To be fair, he's kind of nasty."
01:49:56;01:49:57;"You're one of those girls that's very--"
01:49:57;01:50:00;"Yeah, could you imagine a country song about one of those girls with nervous energy?"
01:50:00;01:50:04;"It's not a good look if you meet somebody for the first time of any gender,"
01:50:04;01:50:08;"and they're holding a raggedy-looking beer that's got, like, nail marks in the--"
01:50:08;01:50:09;"Yeah."
01:50:09;01:50:09;"Don't do it."
01:50:10;01:50:12;"No, this is a good reminder to myself."
01:50:12;01:50:12;"Don't do it."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"Or if you do it, get it fully peeled off."
01:50:14;01:50:17;"But even then, there's going to be, like, some of the white left."
01:50:17;01:50:18;"It's not a good look."
01:50:18;01:50:18;"Don't do it."
01:50:18;01:50:22;"I'm picturing Seinfeld meeting Julia Louis-Dreyfus for the first time,"
01:50:22;01:50:26;"and he's nervously peeled the label off his beer."
01:50:26;01:50:27;"I'm just shredding that label, yeah."
01:50:27;01:50:28;"Right."
01:50:28;01:50:28;"And you're just like--"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"Just looking at your beer and--"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"Ms. Louis-Dreyfus, I run an account, and perhaps you've heard of it,"
01:50:32;01:50:34;"called Seinfeld 2000."
01:50:34;01:50:35;"And she's like--"
01:50:35;01:50:37;"It's just, like, total beep style."
01:50:37;01:50:39;"Her eyes are just, like, staring at your raggedy beer."
01:50:39;01:50:42;"And she's like, ""Uh, yeah."
01:50:42;01:50:44;"Well, good luck with that."""
01:50:44;01:50:49;"I've got, like, bits of, like, wet, ripped label all over my shirt."
01:50:49;01:50:50;"Oh, yeah."
01:50:50;01:50:52;"It's all still dug into your nails."
01:50:52;01:50:53;"You go to shake her hand."
01:50:53;01:50:54;"She's like, ""Ugh!"""
01:50:54;01:50:58;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"Little balls of the rolled up label."
01:51:00;01:51:05;"Little balls of the rolled up label just all over the table."
01:51:05;01:51:07;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:51:07;01:51:08;"Yeah, it is kind of nasty."
01:51:08;01:51:11;"God, I'm thinking about, are there times in my life I've"
01:51:11;01:51:13;"totally made a bad impression by having a raggedy, ripped up beer label?"
01:51:13;01:51:18;"But wait, just to be clear, there's some labels I do feel are not--"
01:51:18;01:51:23;"they haven't been, like, adhesively stuck to the bottle in such a way."
01:51:23;01:51:24;"True."
01:51:24;01:51:26;"But you know that it's still your nails."
01:51:26;01:51:27;"You did it."
01:51:27;01:51:29;"You Wolverine-ed that [BLEEP]"
01:51:29;01:51:32;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:51:32;01:51:33;"It's a bad look."
01:51:33;01:51:36;"And especially if you're sitting at a bar,"
01:51:36;01:51:38;"and you got that [BLEEP] all over the table."
01:51:38;01:51:38;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:51:38;01:51:41;"God, my life is flashing before my eyes."
01:51:41;01:51:43;"And I'm thinking of times I just nervously did that."
01:51:43;01:51:47;"And I was probably sitting across from some upper crust type,"
01:51:47;01:51:48;"sitting across the bar."
01:51:48;01:51:50;"I tried to look good."
01:51:50;01:51:52;"I tried to wear nice clothes."
01:51:52;01:51:55;"I tried to make elegant conversation."
01:51:55;01:52:01;"And it all went out the [BLEEP] window because I nervously just scratched all up on my beard"
01:52:01;01:52:07;"and made little disgusting pellets in a circle at my end of the table."
01:52:07;01:52:08;"Oh, my god."
01:52:08;01:52:10;"Humiliating."
01:52:10;01:52:14;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:52:14;01:52:15;"People, don't do it."
01:52:15;01:52:17;"People, learn from my mistakes."
01:52:17;01:52:19;"Jake, do you do that?"
01:52:19;01:52:20;"I've done it."
01:52:20;01:52:22;"I mean, it's not a regular go-to move."
01:52:22;01:52:23;"But we've all done it."
01:52:23;01:52:25;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:52:25;01:52:26;"We've all been there."
01:52:26;01:52:29;"Shout out to Lee Bryce and one of them girls."
01:52:29;01:52:33;"I mean, he really, like, first line out just tapped into, like,"
01:52:33;01:52:35;"some deeper element of the human condition."
01:52:37;01:52:39;"Lee Bryce, you have my attention."
01:52:39;01:52:41;"You got us hooked."
01:52:41;01:52:48;"The number two song on the Global Country streamers is ""Gabby Barrett"" with ""I Hope."""
01:52:48;01:52:51;"This is a song that came out in 2019."
01:52:51;01:53:01;"[MUSIC - GABBY BARRETT, ""I HOPE""]"
01:53:01;01:53:08;"I, I hope she makes you smile the way you made me smile"
01:53:08;01:53:13;"on the other end of a phone in the middle of a highway driving alone."
01:53:13;01:53:21;"Oh, baby, I, I hope you hear a song that makes you sing along"
01:53:21;01:53:23;"and gets you thinking about her."
01:53:23;01:53:27;"Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah."
01:53:27;01:53:30;"I hope you're full of feelings, sparks by the end of the drive."
01:53:30;01:53:33;"I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night."
01:53:33;01:53:36;"I hope you never, ever feel more free."
01:53:36;01:53:38;"Tell your friends that you're so happy."
01:53:38;01:53:43;"I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans."
01:53:43;01:53:46;"I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand."
01:53:46;01:53:48;"I hope she's wild to bring you wildest dreams."
01:53:48;01:53:51;"I hope she's everything you're ever gonna need."
01:53:51;01:53:58;"And then I hope she cheats like you did on me."
01:53:58;01:54:03;"And then I hope she cheats like you did on me."
01:54:03;01:54:04;"Heavy."
01:54:04;01:54:06;"Not really hearing the country, but that's cool."
01:54:06;01:54:06;"Whatever."
01:54:06;01:54:09;"That could be like Meghan Trainor or something."
01:54:09;01:54:11;"It's the Southern accent makes it country."
01:54:11;01:54:11;"Yeah."
01:54:11;01:54:14;"If it wasn't Southern accent, you'd just call it pop music, I guess."
01:54:14;01:54:17;"But, you know, I guess the subject matter, cheating."
01:54:18;01:54:21;"Obviously, there's cheating in all genres."
01:54:21;01:54:25;"Country music does seem to have like a monopoly on a certain type of cheating song."
01:54:25;01:54:26;"But, you know, it's a good point."
01:54:26;01:54:29;"I mean, this is something we've all heard this before."
01:54:29;01:54:34;"You know, you hear about somebody cheated on somebody and you're, you know,"
01:54:34;01:54:38;"generally my feeling with that stuff is like, that's painful."
01:54:38;01:54:41;"It's not a cool move, but that's life."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"And I hope everybody ends up better for it."
01:54:43;01:54:45;"Clearly the relationship, you know, whatever."
01:54:45;01:54:47;"I try not to be too, too judgmental."
01:54:47;01:54:51;"But then these conversations come up where you, because sometimes you hear,"
01:54:51;01:54:55;"well, that relationship began with people cheating on each other."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"Really not cool."
01:54:57;01:55:01;"They should have been more upfront, but then they ended up being together, you know, for forever."
01:55:01;01:55:02;"Sure."
01:55:02;01:55:07;"But then, so there's always somebody when you have those conversations who says, yeah, but"
01:55:07;01:55:13;"if somebody was willing to cheat with you when you were in a relationship and then you end up"
01:55:13;01:55:18;"with them, wouldn't you always be worried eventually the cycle would repeat?"
01:55:18;01:55:19;"Sure."
01:55:19;01:55:19;"I don't know."
01:55:19;01:55:21;"I don't know what to make of it."
01:55:21;01:55:26;"I think sometimes people are in kind of immature places in their life and they don't know how to"
01:55:26;01:55:28;"deal with stuff and people cheat on each other."
01:55:28;01:55:32;"And maybe people do grow past it and find the right relationship and it's a non-issue,"
01:55:32;01:55:36;"but maybe it is a cycle."
01:55:36;01:55:38;"And I think that's what Gabby Barrett's talking about."
01:55:38;01:55:42;"And she's actually hoping for it as revenge, which I guess is,"
01:55:43;01:55:46;"kind of rude, but you know, she's right to be hurt."
01:55:46;01:55:48;"This guy cheated on her."
01:55:48;01:55:51;"I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand."
01:55:51;01:55:52;"I dig it."
01:55:52;01:55:56;"This one doesn't seem as like less of a window into the--"
01:55:56;01:55:59;"There's no like fun imagery or anything with it."
01:55:59;01:56:00;"It's just sort of like, I hope."
01:56:00;01:56:02;"Okay."
01:56:02;01:56:02;"Right."
01:56:02;01:56:05;"That's what you hope of all the things you hope for."
01:56:05;01:56:07;"You hope that you're angry after--"
01:56:07;01:56:14;"Angry after cheated on country woman is like a classic type of song."
01:56:14;01:56:16;"What was that like?"
01:56:16;01:56:19;"Was it like early Carrie Underwood song that was like about like,"
01:56:19;01:56:20;"""f***ing up the guy's car""?"
01:56:20;01:56:21;"I don't know."
01:56:21;01:56:23;"That might be a whole sub-genre of country music."
01:56:23;01:56:26;"That's like, some guy cheats on you, you f*** up their car."
01:56:26;01:56:28;"And Loretta Lynn's ""Other Woman""."
01:56:28;01:56:32;"I mean, Loretta Lynn's, most of her career is, a lot of her songs are about it."
01:56:32;01:56:36;"But ""The Other Woman"" is, you know, it's a big part of the genre."
01:56:37;01:56:38;"I mean, it's funny when you consider that--"
01:56:38;01:56:40;"Yeah, what am I thinking of?"
01:56:40;01:56:44;"Oh, the song ""Before He Cheats"" from 2005."
01:56:44;01:56:46;"There's a quote from her saying,"
01:56:46;01:56:50;"""She's thinking about him being at some bar with some girl,"
01:56:50;01:56:53;"and she gets really angry and goes outside and destroys his mode of transportation."""
01:56:53;01:56:57;"""Mode of transportation""?"
01:56:57;01:56:58;"Is that what the lyrics are?"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"No, no, that's a quote."
01:57:00;01:57:00;"That's a quote."
01:57:00;01:57:04;"""I'm gonna destroy your mode of transportation."""
01:57:06;01:57:07;"""Oh yeah, yeah."
01:57:07;01:57:10;"I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive,"
01:57:10;01:57:12;"carved my name into his leather seats."
01:57:12;01:57:14;"I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights,"
01:57:14;01:57:16;"slashed a hole in all four tires."
01:57:16;01:57:18;"Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats."""
01:57:18;01:57:23;"I mean, this is just like, a way richer song in terms of imagery."
01:57:23;01:57:25;"Do you see what happens, Larry?"
01:57:25;01:57:26;"You see what happens?"
01:57:26;01:57:31;"Right now, he's probably slow dancing with a bleached blonde tramp."
01:57:31;01:57:33;"That's not very woke, Carrie."
01:57:33;01:57:35;"And she's probably getting frisky right now."
01:57:35;01:57:37;"He's probably buying her some fruity little drink,"
01:57:37;01:57:38;"because she can't shoot whiskey."
01:57:38;01:57:43;"This is kind of like a combination of the Lee Bryce and the Gabby Barrett songs."
01:57:43;01:57:46;"She's being like, ""I'm a real woman who drinks whiskey,"
01:57:46;01:57:48;"and you're buying fruity little drinks for that f*****g loser."""
01:57:48;01:57:54;"She probably drinks doogaritas."
01:57:54;01:57:56;"Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool stick,"
01:57:56;01:57:58;"showing her how to shoot a combo, and he don't know."
01:57:58;01:58:00;"Literally, these are the same--"
01:58:00;01:58:04;"This is like a checklist of the things that Lee Bryce likes about this other girl,"
01:58:04;01:58:06;"because she's like a real bar girl."
01:58:06;01:58:08;"She drinks for real, and she plays pool."
01:58:08;01:58:11;"And she's talking about some loser drinks fruity drinks who can't play pool."
01:58:11;01:58:13;"It's also funny."
01:58:13;01:58:14;"I think that's also why--"
01:58:14;01:58:21;"I mean, I've said many times that I think ""I Will Always Love You"" by Dolly Parton"
01:58:21;01:58:26;"is one of the most beautiful, well-written songs in the American songbook."
01:58:26;01:58:29;"And famously, I think-- I might have this kind of wrong--"
01:58:29;01:58:33;"I think in the same day or the same hour, she wrote that and ""Jolene."""
01:58:33;01:58:35;"Just one of these magic moments."
01:58:35;01:58:37;"You sit down, just bang some s**t out."
01:58:37;01:58:41;"And it's funny, because what's interesting about both those songs is that--"
01:58:41;01:58:44;"and I've said this at length about ""I Will Always Love You,"""
01:58:44;01:58:52;"but it's this unusual sentiment where it's kind of like understanding that life is painful,"
01:58:52;01:58:57;"people fall in and out of love, that beautiful relationships end,"
01:58:57;01:59:02;"that you carry pain and love in your heart for people who you don't have in your life,"
01:59:02;01:59:03;"in the case of ""I Will Always Love You."""
01:59:03;01:59:09;"And ""Jolene"" is also a kind of nuanced version of understanding that it's not all about,"
01:59:09;01:59:12;"""I love this person, I f**king hate that person from my past."""
01:59:12;01:59:15;"""Jolene"" is literally saying to Jolene,"

01:59:19;01:59:23;"you f**king suck, and I'm going to beat the s**t out of my boyfriend"
01:59:23;01:59:24;"because he even thought about cheating on me with you,"""
01:59:24;01:59:29;"it's literally saying to Jolene, ""I recognize that you're an amazing woman."
01:59:29;01:59:34;"And realistically, it's probably very difficult for my man to stay away from you."
01:59:34;01:59:37;"You're very appealing. I'm just pleading with you."
01:59:37;01:59:41;"Don't use your powers for evil. Stay away, please."
01:59:41;01:59:43;"You're really going to ruin my life here."""
01:59:43;01:59:49;"I always wondered if the guy ended up going with Jolene after the song's over."
01:59:49;01:59:51;"Because you just don't know."
01:59:51;01:59:53;"She lets the listener sit in that ambiguity."
01:59:53;01:59:56;"Just like, ""What happened? Did he go with Jolene or not?"""
01:59:56;01:59:57;"Yeah, it's really haunting."
01:59:57;02:00:01;"I feel like that song fades out with just, ""Jolene."""
02:00:01;02:00:05;"Just wailing her name into the night."
02:00:05;02:00:08;"Maybe Jolene said, ""Dolly, listen."
02:00:08;02:00:11;"I will not take your man just because I can."
02:00:11;02:00:15;"You will not find me going down to the pool hall and flirting with him."
02:00:15;02:00:20;"However, if he starts coming over here, that's on him."""
02:00:20;02:00:23;"And maybe Jolene did say, ""All right, girl code."
02:00:23;02:00:24;"I won't go steal your man."
02:00:25;02:00:28;"If your man comes looking for me, what can I do?"""
02:00:28;02:00:30;"I'm putting you on notice, Jolene."
02:00:30;02:00:31;"I am interested."
02:00:31;02:00:34;"But I will not initiate."
02:00:34;02:00:40;"Maybe she wrote those songs back to back because they're about the same two things."
02:00:40;02:00:45;"Last ditch effort, Jolene, please don't take my man."
02:00:45;02:00:46;"Let me level with you."
02:00:46;02:00:48;"This is going to f*cking destroy me."
02:00:48;02:00:50;"And then Jolene's like, ""All right."
02:00:50;02:00:54;"No promises, but I'm not going to go out of my way to steal him."""
02:00:54;02:00:58;"And then a couple of days later, she did in fact steal him."
02:00:58;02:01:00;"And Dolly's like, ""Oh, sh*t."
02:01:00;02:01:04;"Well, I tried and I failed, but I will always love you."""

02:01:26;02:01:30;"I said, ""Hell no, I don't."""

02:02:07;02:02:09;"Very convoluted."
02:02:09;02:02:10;"Yeah, this is very convoluted."
02:02:10;02:02:17;"I mean, Jason Aldean, he's got some bangers, but this one is like, I can't tell honestly"
02:02:17;02:02:21;"if the guy in this song is being honest or not."

02:02:23;02:02:25;"Well, I think he's..."

02:02:42;02:02:44;"I mean, he's excited about her, but..."
02:02:44;02:02:45;"That's not how it feels."
02:02:47;02:02:51;"It's an overused term, but I think this is actually a very straightforward example of"

02:03:04;02:03:05;"Yeah."
02:03:05;02:03:11;"Because the second verse says, ""I said, 'Baby, do you know you sound a little crazy"

02:03:13;02:03:14;"That is classic gaslighting."
02:03:14;02:03:17;"It's just to be like, ""You sound f***ing crazy right now."
02:03:17;02:03:19;"[LAUGHTER]"
02:03:19;02:03:24;"I think probably all the listeners picked up on this, but just to summarize, this song"
02:03:24;02:03:28;"starts with his lady saying, ""Baby, do you ever miss being alone?"""
02:03:28;02:03:32;"And I said, ""Hell no, I don't,"" which already seems overly emphatic."
02:03:32;02:03:34;"Yeah, defensive."
02:03:34;02:03:34;"Yeah."
02:03:34;02:03:37;"And then she said, ""Do you really think I'm where you belong?"""
02:03:37;02:03:38;"I said, ""You know and I know."
02:03:38;02:03:39;"You're perfect for me."
02:03:39;02:03:41;"Everything I'll ever need."""
02:03:41;02:03:43;"All right, that's a pretty nice thing to say."
02:03:43;02:03:48;"But then when the chorus is, and the title of the song is, ""I got what I got,"" that"
02:03:48;02:03:54;"kind of reminds me of if you were with somebody and they said, ""Do you ever miss your ex-girlfriend?"""
02:03:54;02:03:57;"And you just said, ""It's water under the bridge."""
02:03:57;02:04:01;"And they're like, ""Wait, so that's a no?"
02:04:01;02:04:02;"It's water under the bridge."
02:04:02;02:04:05;"So you're saying you never think about them and you're happy to be with me?"""
02:04:05;02:04:07;"The past is the past."
02:04:07;02:04:09;"The past is the past."
02:04:09;02:04:10;"I'm with you now."
02:04:10;02:04:11;"I got what I got."
02:04:11;02:04:13;"And what I don't got, I don't got."
02:04:13;02:04:17;"Okay, you're really not making me feel better about this right now?"
02:04:17;02:04:19;"It's water under the bridge."
02:04:19;02:04:20;"I got what I got."
02:04:20;02:04:22;"And she's like, ""Okay."""
02:04:22;02:04:24;"You sound crazy right now."
02:04:24;02:04:28;"I'm going to go down to the floating dock and get shit-faced because you sound crazy"
02:04:28;02:04:28;"right now."
02:04:28;02:04:31;"When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had."
02:04:31;02:04:33;"It's also some like Dr. Seuss shit."
02:04:33;02:04:33;"Right."
02:04:33;02:04:36;"Just trying to razzle dazzle somebody with language."
02:04:36;02:04:39;"When I got what I got, I don't got what I don't got."
02:04:39;02:04:42;"How could I miss what I don't got when I have what I have?"
02:04:42;02:04:45;"Because if I had what I had, I wouldn't got what I got."
02:04:45;02:04:48;"It's like a Joe Pesci character in like a Scorsese movie."
02:04:48;02:04:49;"Right."
02:04:49;02:04:50;"I got what I got."
02:04:50;02:04:53;"Yeah, it's like-"
02:04:53;02:04:55;"I don't miss what I have, I had."
02:04:55;02:04:58;"The ring leo is like, ""Yeah, no, no, I understand that."
02:04:58;02:05:02;"But I'm saying, do you ever think, 'Listen, you f***ing idiot."
02:05:02;02:05:04;"I said I got what I got."
02:05:04;02:05:06;"No, no, I know you got what you got."
02:05:06;02:05:07;"Listen to this f***ing guy."""
02:05:07;02:05:09;"Starts pushing him around."
02:05:09;02:05:10;"""Hey, no, no, I didn't mean anything by it."
02:05:10;02:05:11;"I got what I got."
02:05:11;02:05:13;"How could I miss what I had if I got what I got?"""
02:05:13;02:05:14;"""No, no, I don't mean-"""
02:05:14;02:05:19;"And then he's like, ""It's water under the goddamn bridge."
02:05:19;02:05:20;"It's water under the goddamn bridge."""
02:05:20;02:05:24;"Well, that was a fun top five."
02:05:24;02:05:31;"I think Morgan Wallen, Seven Summers, and Lee Bryce, one of them girls, tied for first."
02:05:31;02:05:36;"So maybe those should be on our list for the pitching worst margarita of my life."
02:05:36;02:05:37;"I think it's a great idea."
02:05:38;02:05:40;"Well, another time crisis in the past."
02:05:40;02:05:42;"We got what we got."
02:05:42;02:05:43;"We had what we had."
02:05:43;02:05:48;"This time crisis is done."
02:05:48;02:05:49;"We got what we got."
02:05:49;02:05:50;"It's over."
02:05:50;02:05:51;"All right, see you guys in two weeks."
02:05:51;02:05:52;"Peace."
02:05:53;02:05:58;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
