00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:04;00:06;"Winter is here."
00:06;00:10;"It's time to look back and reflect."
00:10;00:12;"We'll be digging in"
00:12;00:15;"to our most listened to songs of the year."
00:15;00:21;"Plus, paying tribute to the late, great Shane McGowan"
00:21;00:23;"and the Pogues."
00:23;00:27;"All this and more on..."
00:27;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:41;00:48;"They were a felt rubbing me, all my rightful chances"
00:48;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:55;01:02;"And so I dealt you the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:13;01:17;"Keep an only man"
01:17;01:20;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:20;01:23;"Last episode of the year, huh?"
01:23;01:24;"That's right."
01:24;01:27;"And our Christmas episode. This is our Christmas Spectacular."
01:27;01:29;"[laughs]"
01:29;01:31;"Wow."
01:31;01:34;"Another year gone by. What's up, Jake?"
01:34;01:38;"Hey, man. Sorry, I'm just getting set up here."
01:38;01:41;"You started a little bit before I was ready."
01:41;01:42;"Oh, sorry."
01:42;01:45;"It's all good, man. This is showbiz. I just gotta..."
01:45;01:46;"Internet radio."
01:46;01:48;"Yep, just gotta get in there."
01:48;01:52;"What was it I wanted to circle back to from the last episode?"
01:52;01:55;"I just thought of it."
01:55;01:58;"What was the last episode? You remember the last episode?"
01:58;02:00;"Well, we did the Trad Wave."
02:00;02:01;"Oh, that was the last episode?"
02:01;02:05;"Yeah, and there was a lot of chatter."
02:05;02:09;"And by a lot of chatter, I mean about five or six tweets headed my way."
02:09;02:11;"About what belongs in the Trad Wave genre?"
02:11;02:15;"Yeah. I thought of Squeeze pulling muscles from Michelle."
02:15;02:19;"And I will tell you that you hit the thread talking about Squeeze muscles from Michelle,"
02:19;02:22;"and it sent me deep into a Squeeze hole."
02:22;02:23;"Oh, really?"
02:23;02:26;"We have a lot of great stuff on the docket. I don't know if we want to do a..."
02:26;02:29;"I could do a whole episode about Squeeze, but I am a huge Squeeze fan,"
02:29;02:35;"and Squeeze was always one of the biggest inspirations for Vampire Weekend in the early days."
02:35;02:36;"I can see that."
02:36;02:37;"Yeah, like..."
02:37;02:40;"[singing]"
02:40;02:41;"Yeah."
02:41;02:45;"Like Oxford Comm, I've said this before, that there's a vein of Trad Wave,"
02:45;02:49;"which is the kind of like smart aleck English wave."
02:49;02:53;"Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, Squeeze, XTC."
02:53;02:56;"That was always very meaningful to me."
02:56;02:59;"And Squeeze in particular, my dad's a huge Squeeze fan."
02:59;03:03;"We had the records and just so many bangers."
03:03;03:07;"Pulling muscles from Michelle, Tempted, Goodbye Girl."
03:07;03:09;"I mean, I've been into some deeper cuts."
03:09;03:11;"Inquintessence."
03:11;03:12;"You know that one?"
03:12;03:13;"I don't know if I know that one."
03:13;03:15;"[singing]"
03:15;03:19;"They had like two lead singers, right?"
03:19;03:24;"The guy that sings Pulling Muscles is not the guy that sings Tempted, right?"
03:24;03:26;"They're two lead singers in Squeeze,"
03:26;03:30;"and they were like the two kind of best friends songwriting team."
03:30;03:34;"Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford."
03:34;03:37;"And Glenn Tilbrook is like the classic high voice dude in Squeeze."
03:37;03:39;"[singing]"
03:39;03:42;"Chris Difford sometimes would sing low."
03:42;03:45;"I don't know if you know some of these early songs like Take Me, I'm Yours or Cool for Cats."
03:45;03:46;"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
03:46;03:48;"[singing]"
03:48;03:53;"And then there's a third dude who was briefly in the band who sang the first verse of Tempted."
03:53;03:55;"But actually, Tilbrook comes in."
03:55;03:57;"[singing]"
03:57;03:58;"Oh, yeah."
03:58;04:00;"[laughing]"
04:00;04:02;"Okay, we're going to do a quick minute on Squeeze."
04:02;04:03;"Yeah."
04:03;04:04;"Can you throw on Inquintessence?"
04:04;04:05;"This is pretty trad wave."
04:11;04:13;"He's just like, little 50s."
04:19;04:21;"Oh, I totally hear the Vampire, man."
04:21;04:22;"That's so cool."
04:22;04:25;"And it's got like a punk energy, but it's not really punk."
04:25;04:30;"Even that keyboard, like organ thing is so Oxford-cult."
04:42;04:46;"It was just a big inspiration lyrically because there's always like little jokes."
04:46;04:50;"And you could tell that I think Chris Difford wrote a lot of the lyrics."
04:50;04:54;"Well, the lyrics in Pulling Muscles are wild."
04:54;04:55;"Yeah."
04:55;05:04;"I remember like Pulling Muscles was one of the first songs when I was a kid where I was like, ""What's going on here?"""
05:04;05:07;"There was a kid down the street that was older than me that was really into that song."
05:07;05:08;"And that's how I knew about it."
05:08;05:11;"And I was like, and I feel like William Tell."
05:11;05:15;"I was like, I knew who William Tell was from like school or whatever."
05:15;05:16;"Yeah."
05:16;05:21;"Like the guy shooting the arrow on top of his kid's head with the arrow."
05:21;05:27;"And I was like, what is like, it was such like an imaginative, like non-sequitur."
05:27;05:30;"And I feel like William Tell."
05:30;05:32;"Let's throw on Pulling Muscles from the show."
05:32;05:38;"So yeah, we were texting about it last week and it was like, he was trying to write lyrics like the Kinks or something."
05:38;05:41;"Like the most like prototypically British."
05:41;05:44;"Yeah. It's about like a British holiday."
05:44;05:48;"They do it down on Canberra Sands. They do it at Waipee."
05:48;05:51;"Yeah. Cause Canberra Sands is like an English seaside town."
05:51;05:55;"They sing about the beach all day and night. The crickets creepy."
05:55;05:57;"Such a sick vocal performance."
05:57;05:58;"Great singer."
05:58;06:00;"Swaying waves in the sky."
06:00;06:04;"A Harold Robbins paper bag."
06:04;06:07;"Surfers drop their boards and dry."
06:07;06:12;"And everybody wants a high."
06:12;06:14;"But behind the shadow of a man's face."
06:14;06:17;"Also, the minor chords are so like menacing."
06:17;06:22;"And I feel like William Tell."
06:22;06:28;"Made Madeline on her tiptoe feet."
06:28;06:30;"Pulling Muscles from a show."
06:30;06:37;"Is this song about anything or is it just a collage of like non-sequitur British imagery?"
06:37;06:40;"I think it's about hooking up on vacation."
06:40;06:43;"Oh, nice."
06:43;06:45;"A demon in a sunshine."
06:45;06:47;"Shadows from the rain."
06:47;06:50;"I think the verses are impressionistic."
06:50;06:57;"An impressionistic collage of things that happen at a seaside resort."
06:57;07:00;"What year did this come out?"
07:00;07:01;"It's like 80?"
07:01;07:05;"I was just wondering if John Lennon heard this."
07:05;07:07;"Oh, that's going to be a close one."
07:07;07:15;"All right, can we get a number crunch?"
07:15;07:17;"What are we trying to crunch?"
07:17;07:20;"Pulling Muscles from a Shell by Squeeze."
07:20;07:24;"What's the release date on that?"
07:24;07:27;"Pulling Muscles from a Shell."
07:27;07:29;"Shell."
07:29;07:39;"That's 1980."
07:39;07:41;"You got a month for me?"
07:41;07:43;"Wait, because Lennon was called December 80?"
07:43;07:45;"Yeah."
07:45;07:46;"I only heard it."
07:46;07:52;"It's funny you say that, Jake, because as a big Squeeze fan, every time I read about them, you always see some quotes like,"
07:52;07:58;"""You know, Tillbrook and Difford were considered the Lennon and McCartney of new waves."""
07:58;08:02;"Sure."
08:02;08:06;"A little boogie-woogie piano here."
08:06;08:21;"I really wonder what Lennon thought of it, because it's so indebted to his style, but it is an interesting trad wave, new wave interpretation of it."
08:21;08:28;"You can totally see Lennon being flak and he asked about punk rock and being like, ""A lot of that stuff's just not that interesting."""
08:28;08:29;"I like Squeeze, though."
08:29;08:30;"Yeah, yeah."
08:30;08:37;"Sophisticated songwriting."
08:37;08:46;"Difford said this is a quote about a memory he has from his time spending at a British holiday camp in a budget resort-type place"
08:46;08:51;"that includes basic accommodations, entertainment, and other facilities."
08:51;08:52;"And I like this part."
08:52;08:58;"Difford came up with a song titled, ""One Fine Day Writing the Words in a New York Apartment."""
08:58;08:59;"Oh, written in New York."
08:59;09:01;"So he's in New York and he's thinking about this."
09:01;09:04;"He's thinking about his growing up in England."
09:04;09:07;"Yeah, and just some kind of all-inclusive resort."
09:07;09:09;"What does ""Pull the Muscle"" from Michelle mean?"
09:09;09:12;"It's such a great chorus."
09:12;09:15;"I think it might be something..."
09:15;09:19;"Isn't it being at a buffet and getting a whole lot of muscles?"
09:19;09:20;"Oh, literally?"
09:20;09:21;"Literally."
09:21;09:23;"And then I know people are lying."
09:23;09:27;"I thought some people think it's about getting some."
09:27;09:29;"Yeah, I know they say that."
09:29;09:31;"It's about anatomy."
09:31;09:41;"I literally do think he's writing about being with his family at an all-you-can-eat buffet and just getting a huge pile of muscles."
09:41;09:42;"Okay, hold on, hold on."
09:42;09:44;"We've got to back up because the chorus goes..."
09:44;09:47;"He's giving all these impressionistic images."
09:47;09:53;"A Harold Robbins paperback, motorboat, whatever."
09:53;09:55;"Just talking about being on vacation, Camber Sands."
09:55;09:57;"They do it in Waikiki."
09:57;09:59;"And then the pre-chorus."
09:59;10:08;"""But behind the chalet, my holiday's complete, and I feel like William Tell made Marion on her tiptoe feet."""
10:08;10:10;"Now I suddenly have this image."
10:10;10:16;"I don't know how old he is, if he's a grown man, if he's first kiss 12 or something."
10:16;10:20;"I don't know, but maybe it's a White Lotus situation."
10:20;10:25;"He's on vacation with his philandering dad, and he's bored and he meets somebody."
10:25;10:35;"But either way, it's a vacation, and finally, one night, behind the chalet, the holiday's really complete because he finally got some."
10:35;10:38;"And he feels like William Tell."
10:38;10:42;"What does that mean? Because William Tell shot the apple off the sunset?"
10:42;10:45;"Maybe he's just in the zone."
10:45;10:47;"Yeah, he's like a bullseye."
10:47;10:48;"He nailed it, dude."
10:48;10:49;"And then made Marion..."
10:49;10:51;"Stakes were really high, and he nailed it."
10:51;10:55;"Actually, made Marion is paired with Robin Hood, but maybe that just didn't sing as well."
10:55;11:00;"""And I feel like Robin Hood made Marion on her tiptoe feet."""
11:00;11:01;"Now William Tell is so deep."
11:01;11:05;"Also, William Tell, I think, was in the New World."
11:05;11:07;"I don't think he was British."
11:07;11:10;"I think he was a British guy, but he was kicking it in Pennsylvania."
11:10;11:12;"Okay, so I need a number crunch on William Tell."
11:12;11:15;"But made Marion on her..."
11:15;11:16;"Yeah, pulling muscles from Michelle."
11:16;11:19;"William Tell, a folk hero of Switzerland?"
11:19;11:20;"Oh."
11:20;11:25;"According to legend, Tell was an expert mountain climber and marksman with a crossbow."
11:25;11:26;"There we go."
11:26;11:29;"Tell arrested in 1901."
11:29;11:30;"No, no, no."
11:30;11:32;"1901?"
11:32;11:35;"William Tell's like 17th century figure in Pennsylvania."
11:35;11:39;"He's a 14th century, but is, you know, the legend..."
11:39;11:40;"Yes, he's..."
11:40;11:44;"It took him hundreds of years to catch him, but he was finally brought to justice in 1901."
11:44;11:45;"Oh, wait."
11:45;11:46;"No, no, no."
11:46;11:47;"Yeah, yeah, that's right."
11:47;11:48;"14th century."
11:48;11:50;"The first written records."
11:50;11:52;"Yeah, 14th century."
11:52;11:55;"Why didn't he leave us in Pennsylvania?"
11:55;11:57;"You're thinking William Penn?"
11:57;11:58;"Thank you."
11:58;12:02;"""And I feel like William Penn."""
12:02;12:03;"According to Wikipedia..."
12:03;12:05;"We should do the American version."
12:05;12:13;"Difford was interviewed, and he said the song is, quote, ""about a memory he has from his time spent at a British holiday camp."""
12:13;12:14;"Oh, we already got that one, Seinfeld."
12:14;12:15;"Oh, you got that?"
12:15;12:17;"Sorry, I stepped out of the room to get something."
12:17;12:18;"Seinfeld stepped out."
12:18;12:20;"Seinfeld's a little bit under the weather."
12:20;12:21;"I stepped out."
12:21;12:23;"""And I feel like Paul Revere."""
12:23;12:28;"Yeah, when he says he feels like William Tell, he feels like he's the man, and also he's got great aim,"
12:28;12:31;"and then made Marion snuck around on her tiptoe feet."
12:31;12:34;"He's like the bad boy. He's like a William Tell Robin Hood figure."
12:34;12:40;"And he finally got a girl, and they're hooking up behind the chalet."
12:40;12:45;"Because, yeah, imagine he's like 12, 13, 14."
12:45;12:46;"He's on a holiday with his parents."
12:46;12:52;"Yeah, he's having some fun, but he really would like to meet a girl."
12:52;12:58;"And then finally the holiday's complete, and because he's got an interesting imagination, he feels like William Tell."
12:58;13:11;"So I think it's possible. I could almost picture a '70s or a '60s movie that hard cuts from somebody finally kissing somebody"
13:11;13:17;"and putting their arms around them, and then it just cuts to an old man cracking open a muscle and pulling it out."
13:17;13:18;"You know what I mean?"
13:18;13:19;"Yeah."
13:19;13:24;"And then you'd watch that in some film class, and they'd be like, ""Do you think this was supposed to be sexual imagery?"""
13:24;13:25;"I don't know."
13:25;13:32;"It's amazing lyric writing, just non-sequitur enough where it really—but it still feels grounded."
13:32;13:34;"Where it really is just like—"
13:34;13:36;"It's got atmosphere, and it's got place."
13:36;13:41;"So Matt sent a text that said, ""Squeeze shot the video for 'Up the Junction,'"" which was a great song."
13:41;13:42;"Love that song."
13:42;13:44;"In John Lennon's kitchen."
13:44;13:45;"Okay, so they were friends."
13:45;13:46;"So they were boys."
13:46;13:51;"♪ I never thought it would happen with me and a girl from Clapham ♪"
13:51;13:56;"Right, which—that's the one where they sell the television because she's pregnant."
13:56;14:02;"So according to sort of Urban Dictionary and other things I'm looking at, this is complicated."
14:02;14:05;"This is some chicken and egg stuff."
14:05;14:09;"It says, ""Pulling muscles is British slang for intercourse."""
14:09;14:16;"However, all the references it cites is the song."
14:16;14:17;"Right."
14:17;14:22;"So yeah, if that was like commonplace slang, I don't think they would have sung it."
14:22;14:30;"Maybe Chris Difford felt like, ""You know, we could use a new, slightly gross euphemism for having sex."""
14:30;14:35;"My point in writing the song was just to give people one more way to talk about having sex."
14:35;14:38;"♪ Pulling muscles from a shell ♪"
14:38;14:43;"Urban Dictionary says, you know, as a way it would be used,"
14:43;14:46;"""Hey Jim, what are you doing with Molly the other night?"""
14:46;14:49;"""Nothing, mate. Just pulling muscles."""
14:49;14:50;"[laughter]"
14:50;14:52;"Gross."
14:52;14:55;"No one's ever said that."
14:55;14:57;"It's also funny because you could pull a muscle."
14:57;15:02;"Yeah, like pulling muscles—you're pulling muscles from a shell or pulling muscles?"
15:02;15:06;"Did you have any other additions to Tradwave, Jake, besides squeeze?"
15:06;15:08;"I don't think so. Did you?"
15:08;15:12;"Well, you know, I think I've got the perfect segue into our next topic."
15:12;15:13;"Oh, yep."
15:13;15:22;"Because the traddest and the waviest of the Tradwave, to me, is the Pogues."
15:22;15:28;"And when I was a young man interested in all these bands and stuff, eventually I got into the Pogues."
15:28;15:33;"Because Shane McGowan, rest in peace, he died recently."
15:33;15:36;"He famously was like an OG punk rocker."
15:36;15:42;"Like there's pictures of him, teeth looking all crazy at like, you know, Clash and Sex Pistols shows."
15:42;15:48;"Because he was like a young dude hanging out in London right when punk broke."
15:48;15:52;"So he was like one of the original punk rock fans."
15:52;15:57;"I mean, maybe even before he had a band, he was just like a notable dude in the scene."
15:57;16:06;"And, you know, a few years later, he realizes that he likes the energy of punk,"
16:06;16:12;"but really he wants to take Tradwave one step further and start a band with kind of punk energy"
16:12;16:16;"that's not just like a little bit rock and roll or a little bit less aggressive."
16:16;16:21;"He takes all that aggression and energy and applies it to something extremely traditional,"
16:21;16:25;"which is traditional Irish folk music."
16:25;16:29;"There were obviously Irish punk bands in the 70s and 80s."
16:29;16:37;"And of course, there's music now like the song from The Departed, which you could say is like Irish."
16:37;16:39;"Is that the Pogues?"
16:39;16:43;"No, no, no. That's Job Kick Murphy's. That's pure Boston."
16:43;16:45;"Let's throw on shipping up to Boston."
16:45;16:51;"You know, I thought of that song from The Departed because I actually listened to the Pogues for the first time,"
16:51;16:55;"like on purpose, when I saw that he had died."
16:55;16:56;"Really?"
16:56;17:00;"Yeah, I was like, ""Oh, that's a band I've always meant to kind of get around to."""
17:00;17:03;"So I've been listening to the Pogues a lot the last few days."
17:03;17:05;"Yeah, I mean, this wouldn't exist without the Pogues."
17:05;17:08;"But I just wanted to play this as like a contrast."
17:08;17:10;"So what year is this?"
17:10;17:12;"This is like early 2000s."
17:12;17:16;"Hmm. Okay, I thought this was like 80s or something."
17:16;17:20;"No, no, no. Job Kick Murphy's, I think, started in the 90s."
17:20;17:25;"But all I'm saying is like, this has got like a hard rock punk sound."
17:42;17:43;"What do you think of this song, Jake?"
17:43;17:48;"I've only really heard it in the context of The Departed, which I've seen like a half dozen times."
17:48;17:51;"I think it's great there."
17:51;17:54;"I don't think I would like ever throw this on."
17:54;18:00;"To me, it's like, and some of the Pogues stuff I really love and some of it not as much."
18:00;18:04;"And the stuff I don't love as much is the stuff that's like just a very literal,"
18:04;18:09;"kind of what this is doing, which is just take an Irish, a traditional Irish song"
18:09;18:12;"and just do it with distortion and like rock drums."
18:12;18:16;"It's just like not as interesting to me."
18:16;18:19;"I love that this is just pure Boston music, though."
18:19;18:20;"Yeah."
18:20;18:23;"Okay, but I just want to throw this on as like, you know, this is like music that plays."
18:23;18:25;"That's a table setter."
18:25;18:29;"Yeah, blends like that kind of punk rock, his voice is so raw."
18:29;18:34;"Whereas the Pogues, they didn't have distorted guitars for the most part."
18:34;18:39;"It really was like a dude who a few years earlier was just like, you know,"
18:39;18:46;"at the craziest punk shows and he just wanted to do an energetic, traditional Irish band."
18:46;18:52;"So, you know, the Pogues have, you know, Penny Whistle and Irish instruments and stuff."
18:52;18:57;"They don't have like, it wasn't really a blending of distorted guitars or anything."
18:57;19:02;"Well, yeah, there are times when it's kind of sounds like ska punk, like kind of rancid-y."
19:02;19:04;"Yeah, there's a bit, it can be a bit of that."
19:04;19:09;"It's not like a rat distortion pedal, but it is like,"
19:09;19:14;"they're definitely rocking like a power chord, but it's like the mid 80s."
19:14;19:16;"It's a different sound."
19:16;19:21;"Sometimes, but like the, you know, what are some of their earliest songs?"
19:21;19:24;"So their first record came out in '84, it looks like."
19:24;19:29;"Yeah, in '84, they dropped Red Roses for Me."
19:29;19:35;"And I don't know, you want to throw in like the Dark Streets of London."
19:35;19:37;"This is like an early Pogue song."
19:37;19:41;"So what age were you when you got into this?"
19:41;19:46;"I remember listening to a lot of music when I was getting out of college."
19:46;19:50;"You know what's funny? I remember hanging out with you in your dorm room at Columbia once."
19:50;19:53;"We were listening to Steel Eyes' band."
19:53;19:55;"Oh yeah, he still has his band."
19:55;19:56;"Yeah."
19:56;20:00;"Yeah, always interested in like British and Irish folk music."
20:00;20:03;"So yeah, like, you know, like this is, you know, it's folk."
20:03;20:06;"I mean, his vocals have a punk quality."
20:06;20:14;"I like a song like the band play the Waltzing Matilda."
20:14;20:16;"That's like maybe not as like,"
20:16;20:22;"Yeah, when they're sort of more like minor vibe-ier, it's a little,"
20:22;20:24;"Yeah, I can see some people,"
20:24;20:26;"maybe it still lands as goofy or something, I don't know."
20:26;20:29;"Yeah, some people, I can see, they have a lot of beautiful ballads."
20:29;20:30;"Yeah."
20:30;20:34;"And he always picked great songs to cover. This one's an original."
20:34;20:41;"Yeah, so, you know, it's just like,"
20:41;20:49;"As people say, there's something, a lot of great Irish songwriters and poets got away with words."
20:49;20:51;"And he definitely had that."
20:51;20:58;"But on their third album, they had the song that we're going to mostly talk about today,"
20:58;21:01;"Fairy Tale of New York, because it's become their biggest song."
21:01;21:03;"And also it's Christmas time."
21:03;21:05;"I mean, so yeah, a band with some punk energy,"
21:05;21:10;"but probably maybe at their best when it came to like the ballads."
21:10;21:15;"I definitely gravitated towards those, like Dirty Old Town."
21:15;21:17;"And this one's beautiful."
21:17;21:20;"So this is 1987, produced by Steve Lillywhite."
21:20;21:27;"Did we ever go deep on this song on the show before?"
21:27;21:29;"No, not that I remember."
21:29;21:34;"So this is the top played song, so I started playing it."
21:34;21:38;"And I was like, this is the pitchiest vocal performance I've ever heard."
21:38;21:40;"And then I was like, I got it."
21:40;21:42;"I was like, oh, he's drunk."
21:42;21:43;"Yeah, right."
21:43;21:45;"He's in the drunk tank in New York."
21:45;21:47;"And maybe he was drunk."
21:47;22:03;"Amazing vocal performance."
22:03;22:04;"It's..."
22:04;22:08;"Kind of like 10 to 1"
22:08;22:12;"I've got a feeling"
22:12;22:16;"This year is for me and you"
22:16;22:21;"So happy Christmas"
22:21;22:25;"I love you, baby"
22:25;22:29;"I can see a better time"
22:29;22:34;"When all our dreams come true"
22:34;22:36;"All right, let's pause it there."
22:36;22:38;"Beautiful introduction."
22:38;22:41;"Just think about this movie's in the film Basquiat."
22:41;22:42;"Oh, it is?"
22:42;22:43;"Yeah."
22:43;22:46;"Apparently Julian Schnabel picked all the music"
22:46;22:50;"based on Basquiat's own record collection."
22:50;22:55;"So it's kind of, there's some kind of sweet about picturing like Basquiat painting,"
22:55;22:58;"listening to Fairytale of New York."
22:58;23:03;"Because of course, the reason the song is still so widely played,"
23:03;23:05;"there's a magical quality to it."
23:05;23:07;"Did he die in like '87, '88?"
23:07;23:08;"He must have."
23:08;23:10;"Yeah, probably right around then."
23:10;23:12;"I thought he died earlier, but..."
23:12;23:14;"Oh, he died in '88."
23:14;23:15;"You're right."
23:15;23:17;"He lived for 28 years."
23:17;23:20;"Whoa, is it possible this is one of the last records he bought?"
23:20;23:21;"It is possible."
23:21;23:25;"It is 100% the last record he bought."
23:25;23:26;"Damn."
23:26;23:29;"Yeah, beautiful intro."
23:29;23:32;"So it's a guy at a drunk tank."
23:32;23:33;"Yeah."
23:33;23:34;"In New York."
23:34;23:35;"Yeah, I'm still not totally sure."
23:35;23:37;"Is the guy in New York?"
23:37;23:39;"Yeah, probably in New York."
23:39;23:41;"It's not clear yet."
23:41;23:42;"An old man said to me, ""Won't see..."""
23:42;23:44;"And then, yeah, he was in the drunk tank."
23:44;23:47;"An old man said to me, ""Won't see another one."""
23:47;23:48;"Kind of dark."
23:48;23:51;"Bunch of like sad, weepy, old drunk guys."
23:51;23:53;"Just like some old dude just being like..."
23:53;23:54;"On Christmas Eve."
23:55;23:57;"""Last Christmas, I'm going to see you, man."""
23:57;23:59;"This guy's like, ""Damn."""
23:59;24:03;"And then he sang a song, ""The Rare Old Mountain Dew."""
24:03;24:04;"Okay, now this is interesting."
24:04;24:06;"♪ Sweet as mountain dew ♪"
24:06;24:09;"♪ Then he sang a song ♪"
24:09;24:15;"♪ The rare old mountain brews ♪"

24:37;24:39;"What did he mean by that? I don't know."
24:39;24:40;"Maybe we should do a little detour"
24:40;24:43;"and listen to ""Mountain Dew"" from the same album,"
24:43;24:45;"""If I Should Fall From Grace With God."""
24:45;24:47;"Is the song called ""The Rare Old Mountain Dew"""
24:47;24:48;"or just called ""Mountain Dew""?"

24:50;24:52;"but they say ""The Rare Old Mountain Dew"" in the song."
24:52;24:57;"So maybe it's like it's an obscure, old Irish folk song"

25:26;25:29;"No, it takes place, I think, in the time that this is--"

26:29;26:31;"It's pretty funny to think that, yeah,"
26:31;26:36;"we have this very artificial soda called Mountain Dew."
26:36;26:39;"And I guess Mountain Dew's been a way of referring"
26:39;26:42;"to beverages for a long time."
26:42;26:45;"It was a slang for a certain kind of whiskey."
26:45;26:48;"There's a 19th century term for whiskey,"
26:48;26:50;"especially Highland Scotch whiskey."
26:50;26:52;"And then it became a soda."
26:52;26:54;"Yeah, they trademarked it in 1948."
26:54;26:57;"But yeah, like, and the original marketing of that soda"
26:57;27:02;"was very, like, kind of like Appalachian hillbilly guys"
27:02;27:03;"drinking Mountain Dew."
27:03;27:05;"So it was a little bit like moonshine."
27:05;27:07;"So that makes sense that they would, you know,"
27:07;27:10;"obviously there's a real connection with the Appalachian music."
27:10;27:11;"And the Scots-Irish."
27:11;27:13;"And the, exactly."
27:13;27:18;"My great-great-grandfather was from County Galway"
27:18;27:22;"and he drank whiskey."
27:22;27:25;"You know, his descendants made it out to Appalachia."
27:25;27:31;"Some of them were moonshiners and they were make up there."
27:31;27:32;"Bootleggers."
27:32;27:34;"They were bootleggers and moonshiners."
27:34;27:38;"They were making some pretty heavy alcohol"
27:38;27:40;"up there in the mountains."
27:40;27:42;"And me, I'm a gamer."
27:42;27:44;"And I drink Mountain Dew Code Red."
27:44;27:46;"And that's a story of my family."
27:46;27:51;"From County Galway to Appalachia to, um."
27:51;27:55;"Well, actually, my dad actually worked for PepsiCo"
27:55;27:58;"in the marketing department for 30 years."
27:58;28:02;"And I'm actually a gamer in Arizona."
28:02;28:03;"Hey Jake."
28:03;28:04;"Mountain Dew Code Red. What's up?"
28:04;28:07;"What do you think about how Mountain Dew"
28:07;28:12;"changed their name to MTN Dew, MTN short."
28:12;28:14;"Wait, that's like for real?"
28:14;28:17;"Yeah, in 2008, the logo was redesigned."
28:17;28:19;"They collapsed the mountain."
28:19;28:22;"So now it's MTN Dew when you see it on the bottle."
28:22;28:25;"Has been for, yeah, for years."
28:25;28:26;"Like 15 years."
28:26;28:30;"You know how there's that rumor that Kentucky Fried Chicken"
28:30;28:32;"legally had to change their name to KFC."
28:32;28:33;"It's not really chicken?"
28:33;28:35;"It's not really chicken."
28:35;28:38;"Maybe Mountain Dew got in trouble"
28:38;28:42;"because they've gone so far away from their mountain roots."
28:42;28:44;"They couldn't claim mountain."
28:44;28:46;"Guys, you can no longer claim mountains."
28:46;28:51;"What you do is so far from that rare old Mountain Dew."
28:51;28:55;"We ran the test, so there's 0% dew for the mountains."
28:55;28:57;"It's mostly factory."
28:57;29:00;"I mean, the old school Mountain Dew logo"
29:00;29:03;"from like the 70s and 80s was so awesome."
29:03;29:06;"It was one of the classic--"
29:06;29:09;"It was actually just a couple hillbillies"
29:09;29:11;"with no shoes on or something?"
29:11;29:14;"No, it was the one with the curved kind of lettering."
29:14;29:19;"You know, there's the Grateful Dead bootleg merch community"
29:19;29:22;"will do the Morning Dew version."
29:22;29:24;"I do think there's also a drawing, right?"
29:24;29:27;"I do think there's a guy."
29:27;29:29;"Yeah, that's a really old one,"
29:29;29:31;"but I'm talking about the classic one that we--"
29:31;29:33;"if you grew up in the 80s--"
29:33;29:35;"You're talking about the green and red."
29:35;29:36;"The classic."
29:36;29:37;"The letters are kind of like--"
29:37;29:38;"Kind of like funky."
29:38;29:39;"Yeah, yeah."
29:39;29:41;"It kind of had like a health food store kind of energy."
29:41;29:42;"I'm looking at it right now."
29:42;29:44;"It's a beautiful logo."
29:44;29:45;"It's such a great logo, man."
29:45;29:50;"And then in the 90s, they went kind of like sports drink marketing"
29:50;29:51;"and just ruined it."
29:51;29:53;"They totally lost the plot,"
29:53;29:57;"but anybody who's listening, do yourself a favor"
29:57;30:02;"and look at some of this old, absolutely gorgeous Mountain Dew imagery"
30:02;30:03;"from back in the day."
30:03;30:08;"But the cans, they used to have a mascot,"
30:08;30:10;"which was kind of like an Appalachian dude"
30:10;30:12;"with a big white beard and a funny hat."
30:12;30:14;"Sometimes he even had a gun."
30:14;30:18;"Yeah, I'm looking at a bottle with a guy with a shotgun,"
30:18;30:19;"and there's like a little pig."
30:19;30:20;"It's like the whole--"
30:20;30:23;"There's a whole story here being told."
30:23;30:26;"So there's another guy on the run."
30:26;30:28;"It's like a silhouette of a man in the distance,"
30:28;30:31;"and then the main hillbilly is trying to shoot him."
30:31;30:32;"He's just like, ""Get off my land."
30:32;30:34;"You trying to steal my Mountain Dew?"
30:34;30:36;"Get off my land."""
30:36;30:38;"He's like a Looney Tunes character."
30:38;30:40;"He's like Yosemite Sam or something."
30:40;30:42;"Yeah."
30:42;30:43;"Let's not go too far afield, though."
30:43;30:44;"Let's circle back to--"
30:44;30:46;"Okay, so anyway, so there's a--"
30:46;30:47;"--Fairytale in New York."
30:47;30:50;"So there's another guy in the drunk tank"
30:50;30:52;"singing the rare old Mountain Dew."
30:52;30:54;"Also, it'd be funny if he was like--"
30:54;30:56;"It was Christmas Eve, he'd be in the drunk tank."
30:56;30:58;"An old man said to me, ""Want to see another one?"""
30:58;31:01;"And then he started explaining to me in depth"
31:01;31:04;"the history of the Mountain Dew logo."
31:04;31:06;"I turned my face--"
31:06;31:09;"I turned my face away--"
31:09;31:10;"And dreamed--"
31:10;31:11;"--and dreamed about you."
31:11;31:13;"Just an old Irish guy just being like,"
31:13;31:15;"""Have you heard the last TC?"
31:15;31:16;"They went pretty deep."
31:16;31:18;"You wouldn't believe the original can."""
31:18;31:19;"He's just like, ""Oh, come on."""
31:19;31:23;"""Oh, 1980, they did a slight redesign on the--"""
31:23;31:24;"Wait, so--"
31:24;31:25;"But I'm with you, Jake."
31:25;31:26;"There's something about--"
31:26;31:28;"So far in the song--"
31:28;31:31;"Okay, actually, we do find out when this was"
31:31;31:34;"because they talk about Sinatra later."
31:34;31:37;"So it's not Gangs of New York time."
31:37;31:40;"So, okay, back to the second verse of the beginning."
31:40;31:41;"""Got on a lucky one."
31:41;31:44;"Came in 18 to 1."
31:44;31:46;"I've got a feeling this year's for me and you."""
31:46;31:47;"So he's gambling."
31:47;31:49;"""So happy Christmas."""
31:49;31:51;"That's always my favorite part."
31:51;31:55;"""So happy Christmas."
31:55;31:58;"I love you, baby."
31:58;32:03;"I can see a better time when all our dreams come true."""
32:03;32:07;"So also, this dude in the drunk tank, [bleep] faced,"
32:07;32:10;"so sweet and sad, it's like he's delusional."
32:10;32:11;"Yeah."
32:11;32:13;"And then that's why the rest of the song,"
32:13;32:15;"the object of his affection,"
32:15;32:19;"has some infamously choice words for him."
32:19;32:20;"[laughter]"
32:20;32:21;"Like, you could--"
32:21;32:24;"It's also-- You can almost imagine this dude--"
32:24;32:26;"It's almost like some, like, Ozzy Osbourne [bleep]"
32:26;32:29;"Like, if you ever read his book or he interviews with him,"
32:29;32:34;"he'd talk about basically just being so beyond hammered"
32:34;32:37;"and having no idea what went down"
32:37;32:41;"and then being in big trouble with Sharon later."
32:41;32:42;"Like, he thought--"
32:42;32:43;"All these stories in his book,"
32:43;32:45;"like, he thought he absolutely crushed it"
32:45;32:47;"at the kid's birthday party,"
32:47;32:50;"and he thought he put on an amazing show,"
32:50;32:53;"and then he, like, wakes up the next morning,"
32:53;32:54;"and, like, she, like, took the kids,"
32:54;32:57;"and he's just like, ""What do you mean?"
32:57;32:58;"I thought it was a great party."""
32:58;33:01;"And she's like, ""Ozzy, he's [bleep] on the cake."""
33:01;33:03;"There's, like, so many stories like that in his book."
33:03;33:06;"Just-- But you could picture this guy's still drunk."
33:06;33:07;"Yeah."
33:07;33:08;"And he's just thinking, like,"
33:08;33:11;"""Things are about to get really good in my relationship."""
33:11;33:13;"Things are turning around."
33:13;33:16;"""I got a really good feeling that, like, okay,"
33:16;33:18;"you know, it's a little random that I'm--"
33:18;33:20;"the cops dragged me here tonight,"
33:20;33:22;"but, like, next year's really gonna be our year."""
33:22;33:26;"Meanwhile, his girlfriend is, like, packing her [bleep]"
33:26;33:28;"and moving in with her sister."
33:28;33:30;"I think we like this guy, you know,"
33:30;33:31;"the narrator of this song."
33:31;33:32;"It's kind of sweet."
33:32;33:35;"""I got a feeling that this year's for me and you."""
33:35;33:37;"All right, let's kick in here."
33:37;33:39;"Okay, and then..."
33:39;33:40;"there's a twist."
33:40;33:42;"The music changes."

34:25;34:28;"like during one of the, like, funerals at the bar,"
34:28;34:29;"-the cop bar. -Oh, I could see that."
34:29;34:32;"But so, Kirstie McCall comes in."
34:32;34:34;"And by the way, Kirstie McCall's father"
34:34;34:38;"was a famous songwriter and, I think, poet,"
34:38;34:41;"Ewan McCall, who wrote, I think he wrote ""Dirty Old Town,"""

34:44;34:47;"I just know her from her kind of, you know,"

34:50;34:52;"Yes, her cover of ""A New England,"""

34:54;34:57;"The great song, ""They Don't Know."""
34:57;34:58;"Oh, right, she had a version of that too."
34:58;34:59;"-Well, she wrote it. -Yeah."
34:59;35:01;"Right, and then Tracy Ullman did a version."
35:01;35:03;"Right, right. Great song."
35:03;35:04;"So she comes in."
35:04;35:07;"They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold,"
35:07;35:08;"but the wind blows right through you,"
35:08;35:10;"it's no place for the old."
35:10;35:12;"When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve,"
35:12;35:15;"you promised me Broadway was waiting for me."
35:15;35:18;"So are these two Irish people who just, like, met in New York?"
35:18;35:20;"Or went to New York together?"
35:20;35:21;"Yeah."
35:21;35:22;"""You were handsome, you were pretty,"
35:22;35:24;"queen of New York City."""
35:24;35:25;"I mean, maybe he's saying--"
35:25;35:27;"Yeah, maybe he did take her to New York,"
35:27;35:28;"and he's saying, like, ""Ah, you're my little queen"
35:28;35:30;"-of New York City."" -Yeah."
35:30;35:32;"Two Irish immigrants."
35:32;35:35;"Things change, but the original concept for the song--"
35:35;35:38;"so the banjo player Feiner came up with the melody"
35:38;35:39;"and the original concept for the song,"
35:39;35:43;"which was set in country Claire on Ireland's west coast,"
35:43;35:46;"involving a sailor in New York looking out over the ocean"
35:46;35:49;"and reminiscing about his time being back home in Ireland."
35:49;35:51;"So I think that if that's the original,"
35:51;35:54;"I think it probably-- with Shane singing it,"
35:54;35:57;"it probably is, yeah, like, two Irish immigrants"
35:57;35:59;"over in New York meeting,"
35:59;36:01;"and it's taking place in New York."
36:01;36:03;"'Cause then they say he changed it."
36:03;36:05;"So that's what I think is happening."
36:05;36:08;"That would make sense, too, that, like, maybe,"
36:08;36:10;"you know, they were young, in love,"
36:10;36:12;"they come to New York together,"
36:12;36:15;"and at first it's kind of exciting,"
36:15;36:17;"and they have these fond memories."
36:17;36:18;"Things go haywire."
36:18;36:21;"He ends up going back to Ireland,"
36:21;36:24;"and then just, you know, he's drunk and delusional"
36:24;36:27;"one night, one Christmas Eve in the drunk tank,"
36:27;36:29;"and he's, like, thinking about his girl,"
36:29;36:31;"who's not even in the same place as him,"
36:31;36:34;"just like, you know what, we still can make it work."
36:34;36:37;"And then there's the boys of the NYPD choir"
36:37;36:39;"were singing ""Galway Bay."""
36:39;36:41;"And this is a song about songs, too."
36:41;36:43;"Everybody's singing."
36:43;36:46;"Also, does the NYPD choir still exist?"
36:46;36:48;"That's a great question."
36:48;36:49;"That is--"
36:49;36:50;"Yeah, they must."
36:50;36:52;"I looked up that-- I was reading the lyrics today,"
36:52;36:55;"and I was like, oh, wow, the NYPD choir."
36:55;36:57;"That is-- I've never heard of that."
36:57;36:59;"That's a really interesting concept."
36:59;37:01;"Yeah, there probably is."
37:01;37:03;"And you know, it's funny, like, all the branches"
37:03;37:06;"of the military have, like, various musical outfits."
37:06;37:08;"It never existed."
37:08;37:09;"It never existed?"
37:09;37:10;"It's a-- yeah."
37:10;37:15;"There's no such thing, which is very-- yes."
37:15;37:16;"I love that."
37:16;37:17;"I think that's great."
37:17;37:18;"I think--"
37:18;37:19;"I'm not-- I mean, it's--"
37:19;37:20;"I wouldn't dispute that."
37:20;37:21;"This is a full universe."
37:21;37:22;"Yeah."
37:22;37:24;"I like the universe in which that it exists."
37:24;37:27;"It's a fictitious NYC, and he's just, like,"
37:27;37:29;"he knows that a lot of-- you know,"
37:29;37:32;"like, a lot of Irish immigrants ended up in the NYPD."
37:32;37:34;"Right, famously a lot of Irish cops."
37:34;37:35;"You know, exactly."
37:35;37:36;"Wait, wait."
37:36;37:38;"I'm looking at the Irish Post here."
37:38;37:39;"Fantastic publication."
37:39;37:43;"And there's an article called ""NYPD Choir Sing Galway"
37:43;37:45;"Bay in Honor of Pogues Classic."""
37:45;37:48;"This is a group of retired NYPD officers"
37:48;37:51;"who have Irish roots, but I think this isn't a true choir."
37:51;37:52;"I think this is a bunch of--"
37:52;37:53;"It's not official."
37:53;37:55;"This is life imitating art."
37:55;37:56;"Right, right."
37:56;37:58;"Is this-- yeah, exactly."
37:58;38:02;"There's just no way that, like, the cops have time to, like--"
38:02;38:03;"But I'm--"
38:03;38:07;"--prehearse for their, like, Christmas choir concert."
38:07;38:10;"Could you imagine 1980s New York City?"
38:10;38:11;"[BLEEP]"
38:11;38:12;"Hell."
38:12;38:14;"And there's a group of dudes who are, like, can't--"
38:14;38:15;"[BLEEP]"
38:15;38:16;"People still need hobbies."
38:16;38:19;"(SINGING) We three kings of oil and tar."
38:19;38:20;"OK."
38:20;38:24;"Or it's like a collegiate, like, a cappella-style choir."
38:24;38:25;"Like--"
38:25;38:27;"I bet there's all sorts of stuff like that."
38:27;38:30;"The NYPD is, like, tens of thousands of people."
38:30;38:33;"I mean, I would just think about how all the branches"
38:33;38:34;"of the military, they have bands."
38:34;38:37;"Maybe it's because they also have colleges."
38:37;38:41;"But, like, I'm pretty sure the Air Force has, like, a jazz band."
38:41;38:43;"Can you look up US Air Force jazz band?"
38:43;38:44;"Let's see if that's a thing."
38:44;38:47;"While you look up the jazz band, the NYPD"
38:47;38:49;"does have a choir, the closest thing--"
38:49;38:52;"well, it does not have a choir."
38:52;38:55;"The closest thing would be the NYPD Pipes and Drums,"
38:55;38:58;"who are featured in the video for this song."
38:58;39:00;"OK, so that's pretty Irish."
39:00;39:01;"Yeah."
39:01;39:03;"Oh, there is a jazz band."
39:03;39:06;"It's called the Airmen of Note, and it's the premier jazz"
39:06;39:08;"ensemble of the US Air Force."
39:08;39:10;"See, there's all sorts of stuff like that."
39:10;39:12;"That's so funny."
39:12;39:14;"Air Force jazz band, da-da-da-da-da-da-da."
39:14;39:15;"Here's a great little anecdote."
39:15;39:17;"So they brought in--"
39:17;39:20;"for the video of this, they brought in the NYPD Pipes"
39:20;39:27;"and Drums group, and they got so drunk on the trip"
39:27;39:31;"over to the shoot that they were more drunk than Shane"
39:31;39:33;"and the band when they showed up."
39:33;39:37;"And they refused to work unless they got more booze."
39:37;39:41;"The boys of the NYPD Pipes and Drums band."
39:41;39:43;"Are there any Irish roots on TC?"
39:43;39:45;"What about you, Jake?"
39:45;39:47;"No, I was thinking about this today."
39:47;39:50;"I'm pretty sure I'm just English and Scottish."
39:50;39:51;"You're just an Englishman?"
39:51;39:54;"Pretty much exclusively English and Scottish."
39:54;39:56;"I think so, though, and some German, too."
39:56;40:00;"But I don't think I have Irish."
40:00;40:01;"I wish I did."
40:01;40:03;"Have you done like Ancestry 23?"
40:03;40:05;"Yeah, I just don't remember."
40:05;40:07;"Yeah, it's been a long time since I looked at it."
40:07;40:12;"But I'm pretty sure it was like English, Scottish, and German."
40:12;40:13;"Maybe Colin."
40:13;40:15;"So close, but no cigar."
40:15;40:16;"Colin?"
40:16;40:17;"Maybe."
40:17;40:19;"Maybe someone on the producer side."
40:19;40:20;"Seinfeld, you got any Irish heritage?"
40:20;40:22;"Colin's got a Polish last name, but--"
40:22;40:25;"I have zero Irish heritage."
40:25;40:26;"Either of you guys?"
40:26;40:27;"No, sir."
40:27;40:28;"Ezra, Nick?"
40:28;40:29;"No."
40:29;40:30;"No, sir."
40:30;40:33;"But I've always felt very connected to the Irish people."
40:33;40:37;"Growing up in New Jersey, there's a lot of Irish pride"
40:37;40:39;"where I grew up."
40:39;40:42;"I mean, Jake and I have often discussed on the show"
40:42;40:44;"the East Coast names."
40:44;40:47;"And when people think of East Coast names,"
40:47;40:50;"you might think of Italian names first, but also Irish."
40:50;40:51;"For sure."
40:51;40:55;"I mean, my best friend growing up was named John Joyce."
40:55;40:56;"Really?"
40:56;40:57;"Yeah."
40:57;40:59;"That would've been hard if they just named him James Joyce."
40:59;41:00;"Why not?"
41:00;41:03;"And later, they were just like, oh, we didn't think of that."
41:03;41:04;"Crazy."
41:04;41:06;"Jim Joyce."
41:06;41:07;"OK, so where are we?"
41:07;41:09;"This sounds a bit impressionistic, too."
41:09;41:11;"So we just heard the boys of the NYPD choir were singing ""Galway Bay,"""
41:11;41:13;"and the bells were ringing out for Christmas Day."
41:13;41:20;"I mean, it's also an interesting song, because it's this kind of weird"
41:20;41:24;"hall of mirrors between Ireland and New York."
41:24;41:29;"So it's not totally sure where he is in the beginning."
41:29;41:32;"Either he's in a drunk tank in New York with a bunch of Irish people"
41:32;41:36;"singing Irish songs, or he took his girl to New York from Ireland,"
41:36;41:39;"and now they're listening to the fictitious NYPD choir"
41:39;41:43;"singing an Irish song, ""Galway Bay,"" about a place in Ireland."
41:43;41:45;"It's kind of interesting, you know?"
41:45;41:48;"And that first verse that Kirsty McCall comes in on"
41:48;41:51;"is pretty upbeat and optimistic."
41:51;41:54;"""You were handsome, you were pretty, the queen of New York City."""
41:54;41:57;"And Sinatra is singing, they're partying in New York,"
41:57;41:59;"they're seeing the boys of NYPD."
41:59;42:01;"The vibe's about to shift, though."
42:01;42:02;"I mean, yeah."
42:02;42:03;"Verse three, vibe shifts."
42:03;42:07;"And also that they've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold."
42:07;42:09;"It's that classic, ""The streets are paved with gold."""
42:09;42:11;"This is exciting."
42:11;42:13;"Everyone in America is rich."
42:13;42:14;"Everyone in America is rich."
42:14;42:19;"I mean, above all, this song is about disappointment."
42:19;42:21;"We don't know exactly what happened, maybe we'll figure it out,"
42:21;42:26;"but it's some sort of failed immigrant story."
42:26;42:28;"Whatever it is, it didn't turn out great."
42:28;42:30;"It's disappointing."
42:30;42:31;"What a great title, too."
42:31;42:33;"""Fairy Tale of New York."""
42:33;42:34;"All right, let's keep going."

43:02;43:07;"""Jingle bells are ringing out for Christmas night."""
43:07;43:09;"All right, let's look at that for a second."
43:09;43:17;"And that's why this song can never quite make it to Jingle Bell Rock status."
43:17;43:19;"Right."
43:19;43:21;"She calls him a bum and a punk."
43:21;43:24;"He calls her a [bleep] on junk,"
43:24;43:26;"implying now she's addicted to heroin."
43:26;43:27;"It really got bad."
43:27;43:31;"Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed."
43:31;43:36;"And then, ""Happy Christmas, your ass, I pray to God it's our last."""
43:36;43:39;"That's one of the most brutal..."
43:39;43:43;"Yeah, no, in the last verse, the last verse ended,"
43:43;43:47;"""We kissed on a corner, then danced through the night."""
43:47;43:48;"Right."
43:48;43:49;"And now..."
43:49;43:50;"Back to reality."
43:50;43:51;"Yeah."

43:57;43:59;"""And the bells are ringing out."""
43:59;44:02;"Okay, and then the last verse is so gorgeous,"
44:02;44:05;"the way the music kind of shifts a little bit."
44:05;44:06;"Oh, yeah, it's beautiful."
44:06;44:08;"Before you jump into it,"
44:08;44:11;"I want, when you said it couldn't be Jingle Bell Rock,"
44:11;44:13;"not in America, but in the UK,"
44:13;44:16;"it's the most played Christmas song of the 21st century."
44:16;44:17;"That rules."
44:17;44:20;"Wow, when they just bleep out the F word?"
44:20;44:24;"Not in my son's sixth grade class."
44:24;44:25;"Wait, tell that story, Nick."
44:25;44:26;"Oh, yeah."
44:26;44:29;"Okay, when Shane passed away,"
44:29;44:32;"I guess Max's teacher, who I love,"
44:32;44:34;"who's a wonderful teacher,"
44:34;44:38;"she wanted to play this song."

44:59;45:00;"And she starts playing it,"

45:05;45:07;"as soon as that second verse kicks in,"
45:07;45:09;"you know, Max hears, ""S***."""

45:23;45:24;"And he's like, ""She forgot."""
45:24;45:27;"Like she forgot, but she can't stop it,"
45:27;45:28;"because that would be so crazy."
45:28;45:30;"And then she says, ""Maggot."""
45:30;45:33;"And Max goes, ""Oh, man."""
45:33;45:35;"And he goes, ""I start dying,"
45:35;45:38;"because I think I know what's going to come next."""
45:38;45:40;"And he comes home, and he says,"
45:40;45:43;"""Dad, you got to hear what happened in class today."""
45:43;45:44;"And almost immediately,"
45:44;45:48;"all the parents get an email from the teacher saying--"
45:48;45:49;"Apologizing."
45:50;45:52;"I wouldn't even say it was an apology."
45:52;45:53;"It was more just like,"
45:53;45:55;"""Hey, your kids might come home today"
45:55;45:57;"and want to talk about what we heard in class."
45:57;45:59;"I played them this song."""
45:59;46:00;"Wow."
46:00;46:02;"Inappropriate."
46:02;46:04;"But it's so funny to go, you know,"
46:04;46:06;"it also is a song that I guess--"
46:06;46:07;"It's a beautiful song."
46:07;46:08;"It's a beautiful song,"
46:08;46:13;"but also a British Max is probably hearing this."
46:13;46:15;"It's the most played Christmas song in the UK."
46:15;46:20;"He would be hearing this every day, every year."
46:20;46:21;"He would have heard this."
46:21;46:23;"He would have heard this a long time ago."
46:23;46:25;"And I mean, obviously, you know,"
46:25;46:28;"if you want to be charitable,"
46:28;46:31;"this song is about two people."
46:31;46:34;"They really are hitting rock bottom in that verse,"
46:34;46:37;"and they're just going in on each other."
46:37;46:39;"She's not in her right mind"
46:39;46:41;"when she throws that word around."
46:41;46:43;"I'm sure we could probably find like an essay somewhere"
46:43;46:44;"where people say, like,"
46:44;46:46;"""Why I have mixed feelings about this song,"
46:46;46:47;"even though I love it."""
46:47;46:50;"But anyway, let's get into this beautiful final verse."
46:50;46:52;"It's a special moment in the song."

47:43;47:45;"Also, it's interesting, by having all those harmonies,"
47:45;47:47;"it's like a very unique moment in the song."
47:47;47:49;"It's almost like she's not in the room with him anymore."
47:49;47:52;"She's talking to him from beyond the grave,"

48:02;48:04;"And this part is just so sad."
48:04;48:06;"I mean, you could look at it as sweet,"
48:06;48:08;"but I would just find it so sad."
48:08;48:11;"'Cause you do, this guy, he messed up."
48:11;48:13;"Like, something, whatever happened,"
48:13;48:14;"it didn't turn out well."
48:14;48:16;"It's a very disappointing,"
48:16;48:19;"whether it's an immigration story that didn't turn out great,"
48:19;48:22;"a romance that didn't turn out great,"
48:22;48:24;"all of the above,"
48:24;48:26;"a guy who used to be young and fun,"
48:26;48:28;"and now he's like an old alcoholic."
48:28;48:30;"It's sort of almost like, I don't know,"
48:30;48:32;"I'm trying to think of the movie,"
48:32;48:34;"but almost like ""Boogie Nights-ish"" or something."
48:34;48:35;"It's like, you get these guys,"
48:35;48:37;"like, let's go to New York together."
48:37;48:41;"They take this sort of,"
48:41;48:44;"spend all their money, take this coach plane over."
48:44;48:45;"He says, ""You got Broadway waiting for you."
48:45;48:47;"You're a great singer,"" or something."
48:47;48:48;"They show up in New York."
48:48;48:50;"- It just sucks. - It just, it sucks."
48:50;48:52;"She gets addicted to junk."
48:52;48:54;"He starts drinking too much."
48:54;48:56;"You know, literally it was this, you know,"
48:56;48:58;"thinking of being on the Irish countryside,"
48:58;48:59;"and you got your life ahead of you,"
48:59;49:02;"and then you're in (beep) 1987 Times Square."
49:02;49:04;"- They messed up, and I mean, I'm sure many people,"
49:04;49:06;"I mean, this is the story as old as time."
49:06;49:09;"People looking for a new life somewhere."
49:09;49:10;"A lot of people, it works out."
49:10;49:12;"Some people, it turns out worse."
49:12;49:14;"- I mean, circle back to Steve Forbert, man."
49:14;49:18;"Dude left Georgia or wherever that was, Mississippi,"
49:18;49:21;"and went up to New York to be part of the punk scene."
49:21;49:24;"Worked out for him, more or less."
49:24;49:26;"- Not everybody gets to be Steve Forbert."
49:26;49:28;"- But, you know, you moved to New York"
49:28;49:30;"with stars in your eyes."
49:30;49:31;"- Yeah, no, totally."
49:31;49:35;"But the thing about this guy in this song is,"
49:35;49:38;"it's also just two people looking back on the past,"
49:38;49:40;"which of course you can't change."
49:40;49:42;"And she's saying, ""I'm so sick of you."""
49:42;49:44;"She's basically saying, ""You ruined my life."
49:44;49:47;"""You took my dreams and you basically crushed them."
49:47;49:49;"""I believed in you and you ruined it."""
49:49;49:51;"And then this is so sad when he says,"
49:51;49:52;"he basically saying, ""No, no, no."
49:52;49:55;"""You gotta understand, I kept them with me, babe."
49:55;49:57;"""I didn't take your dreams and throw them in the trash."

51:20;51:22;"He's still sitting in the drunk tank being like,"

51:38;51:42;"Yeah, you're right, maybe it is just a song"
51:42;51:44;"about disappointment and addiction,"
51:44;51:46;"'cause you could totally picture"
51:46;51:49;"a well-meaning person trapped in addiction,"
51:49;51:51;"and they keep telling somebody,"
51:51;51:54;"""No, no, no, I really wanna figure this out."""

51:58;52:02;"And you say, ""But I feel like you keep crushing my dreams."""
52:02;52:04;"And it's like, ""Well, not on purpose."""
52:04;52:08;"I mean, actually, your dreams are really important to me."
52:08;52:11;"I would even say they're combined with my dreams,"

52:14;52:15;"either it's this guy's fault"
52:15;52:22;"or it's just reality has dealt them a kind of raw hand, but--"

52:38;52:40;"Where am I?"
52:40;52:41;"- Well, I'm glad I--"
52:41;52:43;"I spent a lot-- I listened to that song"
52:43;52:45;"like 15 times this week."
52:45;52:48;"I really-- I'm really connected with that song,"
52:48;52:49;"which was fun."
52:49;52:50;"- It's a beautiful song."
52:50;52:54;"I'm still not sure if this guy's in Ireland or New York."
52:54;52:56;"- You know what? I don't know if he knows."
52:56;52:57;"- Yeah, he doesn't know."
52:57;52:59;"- Yeah, it's really kind of-- it's really cool"
52:59;53:03;"'cause it's like-- it does feel very lived in"
53:03;53:05;"and kind of viscerally real,"
53:05;53:07;"but at the same time, it's like,"
53:07;53:09;"we don't even know where we are."
53:09;53:13;"We could be in Ireland or-- yeah."
53:13;53:16;"- The fabric of reality is tearing in this song."
53:16;53:17;"- He's bailed out."
53:17;53:22;"He's walking out in the dawn light"
53:22;53:24;"on December 25th,"
53:24;53:26;"goes into the bodega,"
53:26;53:28;"grabs a 20-ounce Mountain Dew."
53:28;53:30;"- Yep."
53:30;53:32;"- Reset."
53:32;53:33;"- It's the day-- he's like,"
53:33;53:35;"""I'm finally gonna quit drinking."""
53:35;53:36;"Yeah, walks in the bodega,"
53:36;53:40;"he's just like, ""Oh, loading up on beer again?"

53:41;53:42;"""Nah."
53:42;53:44;"Today it's gonna be a Mountain Dew."""
53:44;53:45;"- Takes a sip."
53:45;53:47;"It's like, ""This is dog [bleep]."""
53:47;53:51;"- Turns around and-- turns around and buys a [bleep]"
53:51;53:53;"- I still wonder if maybe she is dead"
53:53;53:55;"'cause in the-- in the-- the mean verse,"
53:55;53:57;"he says, ""You're lying there almost dead"
53:57;53:58;"on a drip in that bed."""
53:58;54:00;"And there is something weird about that final verse."
54:00;54:01;"Like, as you pointed out, Jake,"
54:01;54:03;"suddenly her voice has all these harmonies"
54:03;54:05;"and it takes on a different quality."
54:05;54:08;"- Yeah, it's really-- yeah, it's totally--"
54:08;54:11;"like, that last verse really stands out."
54:11;54:13;"Her harmonies are so good in that part."
54:13;54:14;"- And just that ending."
54:14;54:17;"""I can't-- can't make it all alone."
54:17;54:19;"I've built my dreams around you."""
54:19;54:20;"And the frightening thing is, like,"
54:20;54:23;"I don't think this guy's-- either she's dead"
54:23;54:24;"or they're not together,"
54:24;54:30;"but this is a man who's built his dreams on sand."
54:30;54:31;"Whatever he built his dreams on,"
54:31;54:33;"he's gonna have to make it alone."
54:33;54:35;"I think he is alone."
54:35;54:36;"He's in the drunk state."
54:36;54:37;"- No, it's like, I can see the movie."
54:37;54:39;"I'm trying-- it's like, they come out together."
54:39;54:40;"She's more positive."
54:40;54:42;"Somehow she, like, ends up with, like,"
54:42;54:46;"the worst addiction, you know, like, than he does."
54:46;54:49;"You know, he's drinking, but now she's shooting up."
54:49;54:50;"And then she's the one who dies."
54:50;54:52;"Now he's left alone, but he's sort of--"
54:52;54:53;"- I know what you mean. I feel like I've seen that movie."
54:53;54:54;"I just can't place it."
54:54;54:55;"- It's just-- I mean, it's brutal."
54:55;54:56;"But you know what I mean?"
54:56;54:57;"It's brutal, because now, yeah,"
54:57;55:00;"it does feel like she's dead or gone,"
55:00;55:03;"and he's now alone, but he's the one who sort of"
55:03;55:05;"was the-- - Instigator."
55:05;55:07;"- Instigator in it, yeah."
55:07;55:10;"- Yeah, he let her down a dark path."
55:10;55:13;"And then also, back to the title,"
55:13;55:14;"""Fairy Tale of New York,"""
55:14;55:18;"on the one hand, it's, you know, a Christmas fairy tale,"
55:18;55:22;"you know, a story that-- with emotion and whatever."
55:22;55:24;"But also, in one interpretation--"
55:24;55:26;"maybe the obvious interpretation of the song is"

55:57;55:59;"- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas."
55:59;56:00;"I will say, on a more positive note,"
56:00;56:06;"I just found out that they do beep that word in the UK."
56:06;56:08;"- In Britain, no. - Which-- in Britain,"
56:08;56:11;"on the radio, which causes an uproar every year."
56:11;56:12;"- Oh, I'm sure. - Oh, 'cause some people are like,"
56:12;56:14;"""Don't beep it, come on."" - Yeah."

56:16;56:18;"- Old-timers, the old-timers are like, ""Come on."""

56:21;56:24;"if you're gonna beep that word, you gotta beep ""maggot"" too,"
56:24;56:27;"because otherwise people hear the rhyme,"
56:27;56:29;"and they'll hear it in their head."
56:29;56:32;"- So, uh, Kirsten McCall did--"
56:32;56:36;"she did actually change it to ""you're cheap and you're haggard"""
56:36;56:40;"as a substitute line when she did it live in, like, 1990."

57:00;57:04;"- It says in 1990 she changed it, you know?"
57:04;57:08;"And then in '92, I guess there was a TV performance"

57:10;57:12;"""Yeah, you're cheap and you're haggard."""

57:45;57:46;"But, you know, it's real."
57:46;57:47;"There's real emotion in there."
57:47;57:48;"I know what you mean, Jake."
57:48;57:54;"Lived in, like-- it just feels like real characters,"
57:54;57:55;"real emotion."
57:55;57:58;"And even if you don't go deep on this song,"
57:58;58:01;"'cause I think you still kind of feel it."
58:01;58:03;"- I'm gonna put it on Christmas morning"
58:03;58:05;"at my parents' house this year"
58:05;58:09;"and add it to the Longstreth family Christmas"
58:09;58:11;"tradition."
58:11;58:12;"- Might get in trouble."
58:12;58:14;"- We'll see how it goes."
58:14;58:15;"We'll see what happens."
58:15;58:19;"- As we get to the end of the year,"
58:19;58:21;"it's also a great time to reflect on"
58:21;58:24;"all the amazing music that we enjoyed."
58:24;58:27;"Now, we're about to dive into both Jake"
58:27;58:31;"and my top five most listened to songs"
58:31;58:32;"on Apple Music."
58:32;58:36;"And this is the time of year we get a little more personal."
58:36;58:39;"We kind of let you into our world."
58:39;58:40;"Now, before we do that,"
58:40;58:42;"I just wanted to say that--"
58:42;58:43;"I'm not blowing up your spot--"
58:43;58:46;"it sounds like, Nick, roughly,"
58:46;58:49;"your biggest artist of the year was Zach Bryan."
58:49;58:50;"You're a huge fan."
58:50;58:51;"- Yeah."
58:51;58:52;"- And Seinfeld-- - Surprising."
58:52;58:53;"- Yours is Taylor Swift."
58:53;58:55;"- No, Taylor Swift was number two."
58:55;58:57;"Caroline Polachek was number one,"
58:57;58:59;"but Taylor Swift-- - That's tight."
58:59;59:00;"- Taylor Swift, close second."
59:00;59:02;"- Caroline Polachek is great."
59:02;59:04;"I've been a fan since the chairlift days."
59:04;59:06;"Now, Taylor Swift, at this point,"
59:06;59:07;"is such a huge body of work."
59:07;59:08;"What do you think--"
59:08;59:10;"Was it one album or one song"
59:10;59:12;"that got her to your number two slot?"
59:12;59:14;"- I got a rotation of a few songs I like"
59:14;59:16;"that I kind of-- I'll go through a phase,"
59:16;59:18;"I'll listen to it on repeat,"
59:18;59:19;"then I move on to the next."
59:19;59:20;"- What songs?"
59:20;59:22;"- I'd love to get a Seinfeld's"
59:22;59:24;"""Guide to Taylor Swift"" episode."
59:24;59:25;"Maybe give us a little preview."
59:25;59:27;"What's, like, your favorite of the year?"
59:27;59:30;"- Maybe also a Seinfeld-Taylor Swift playlist."
59:30;59:32;"- I love this."
59:32;59:33;"I don't know where to start with her,"
59:33;59:37;"so I would love a Seinfeld-curated playlist."
59:37;59:38;"- Oh, wow."
59:38;59:40;"I mean, in no particular order,"
59:40;59:45;"I mean, there's the ""All Too Well"" 10-minute version,"
59:45;59:46;"Taylor's version."
59:46;59:48;"Oh, ""Cruel Summer."""
59:48;59:50;"Jake, I know you know that one off ""The Lover."""
59:50;59:51;"- That's the big hit."
59:51;59:52;"- Sure, sure."
59:52;59:53;"- Sure."
59:53;59:54;"Oh, Nick, you got a, like,"
59:54;59:57;"""Snow on the Beach"" featuring Lana Del Rey."
59:57;59:58;"- Yes."
59:58;01:00:00;"- I know Lana Del Rey is your girl,"
01:00:00;01:00:02;"so why not throw a little Taylor into the mix?"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"- She was my number two, actually."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"There you go."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"I like--I do like that."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"- Seinfeld, are you listening to these songs on repeat?"
01:00:08;01:00:09;"Like, you listen to them, like,"
01:00:09;01:00:11;"four or five times in a row?"
01:00:11;01:00:13;"Like, in the car or what?"
01:00:13;01:00:16;"- You know, when you're a knowledge worker by day,"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"sometimes you just want to have something"
01:00:18;01:00:20;"a little bit mindless on in the background"
01:00:20;01:00:23;"where you don't have to, you know--"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"you know what I'm saying."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"- Where you're not listening to it,"
01:00:26;01:00:27;"you're just, like, typing away."
01:00:27;01:00:28;"- You're typing away,"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"you're barely registering that it's even playing,"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"but then you--and then you do kind of acknowledge,"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"you're like, ""Oh, yeah, I'm listening to this."""
01:00:34;01:00:36;"Or you might even walk away from your desk"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"and it's still playing on its own."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"That's also a thing."
01:00:40;01:00:43;"- Just a really inspiring connection with music."
01:00:43;01:00:45;"[laughter]"
01:00:45;01:00:47;"It's not that, like, ""Oh, my God,"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"I love this song so much."""
01:00:49;01:00:51;"It's just, like, I can't get enough of it."
01:00:51;01:00:55;"It just opens up this whole emotional valley in my life."
01:00:55;01:00:58;"No, it's just, like, it's on, like, it's white noise."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"- Well, it's a little bit of both."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"I mean, I will get obsessed--"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"- You know me, I like to, like, color things"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"in a slightly negative, humorous way."
01:01:05;01:01:08;"So you guys feel like you need to editorialize"
01:01:08;01:01:10;"and spin it back to a more positive way, that's fine."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"[laughter]"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"- It's the exact opposite of what you just said, Jake."
01:01:14;01:01:16;"- Okay. - It's a deep appreciation."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"- My bad, my bad."
01:01:17;01:01:20;"Look, I just hope whatever faceless corporation"
01:01:20;01:01:24;"you work at, Seinfeld, and I've never bothered to ask,"
01:01:24;01:01:27;"but whatever you do--"
01:01:27;01:01:28;"- Frito-Lay, it's Frito-Lay."
01:01:28;01:01:31;"- Whatever you do during the day at Frito-Lay,"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"I hope you're enjoying the music"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"slightly more than Jake is implying,"
01:01:35;01:01:38;"but I hope you're not paying that much attention"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"that you're just, you know,"
01:01:41;01:01:44;"enjoying beautiful art on company time,"
01:01:44;01:01:47;"because that's not what Frito-Lay's paying you for."
01:01:47;01:01:50;"- They're paying him for the savage clapbacks"
01:01:50;01:01:53;"and all of his social media managing,"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"and he's just sitting there listening to ""Cruel Summer"""
01:01:55;01:01:58;"thousands of times as he just goes after Wendy's."
01:01:58;01:02:00;"That's what they're paying him for."
01:02:00;01:02:05;"- I think Frito-Lay needs to send a thank-you letter"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"to Caroline and Taylor"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"for really just keeping me motivated,"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"keeping me productive,"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"and keeping those juices flowing"
01:02:13;01:02:16;"as I clap back at various other fast food brands."
01:02:16;01:02:18;"[laughter]"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"- I throw on ""So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings,"""
01:02:20;01:02:22;"and I just start clapping back."
01:02:22;01:02:24;"Well, one thing I appreciate,"
01:02:24;01:02:28;"is that both Jake and Seinfeld"
01:02:28;01:02:30;"are checking out some new music."

01:19:36;01:19:40;"- Hey, Three Stacks, where's the flutes?"
01:19:40;01:19:43;"- We were promising criticism. - Only criticism, light on flutes."
01:19:43;01:19:46;"- I did find it a little light on flute."
01:19:46;01:19:49;"- I could have used some more flutes, Andre."
01:19:49;01:19:52;"- Yeah, I was picturing more, like,"
01:19:52;01:19:55;"they were all through, like, a filter or some sort of, like--"
01:19:55;01:19:57;"- Auto-tune? - --pedal or something."
01:19:57;01:20:01;"- Is he tuning the flutes? - No."

01:20:23;01:20:26;"It was like, I wanted there to be solos and stuff."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"It wasn't out. It was just, like,"
01:20:28;01:20:31;"there was, like, a composed melodic line that they would do"
01:20:31;01:20:34;"in, like, some sort of-- - I haven't spent serious time with it yet."
01:20:34;01:20:37;"- You wanted to sort of go free jazz."
01:20:37;01:20:40;"You just wanted to sort of-- - Not free jazz, but, like,"

01:20:42;01:20:46;"I don't want, like, late period Coltrane or something."

01:20:48;01:20:51;"Like, you know, but I just--"

01:20:57;01:20:59;"- He's trying his best. He's not--"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"he hasn't been a career-long flute player."

01:21:05;01:21:08;"This is kind of like he's warming up to the instrument."

01:21:24;01:21:26;"with its lack of flutes. - No, no, no."
01:21:26;01:21:29;"- I was, like, sad while listening to his Taylor Swift song"

01:32:10;01:32:12;"- And I saw Fish again."
01:32:12;01:32:15;"- And I saw Fish again in the summer at the Garden."
01:32:15;01:32:18;"I don't know if I talked about that show."
01:32:18;01:32:20;"I felt like maybe it was getting a little boring"
01:32:20;01:32:22;"doing like a scene report for every Fish show."
01:32:22;01:32:26;"But I will say that Fish show at the Garden this summer"
01:32:26;01:32:29;"was interesting because I brought two people"
01:32:29;01:32:31;"who had never seen Fish before,"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"Dev Hines and Rashida."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"- That's tight."
01:32:34;01:32:36;"- And everybody had a good time."
01:32:36;01:32:38;"- Love to hear it."
01:32:38;01:32:40;"- We were sitting by the drummer from Goose."
01:32:40;01:32:41;"Said what's up to him."
01:32:41;01:32:43;"- Randomly?"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"- Kind of randomly, yeah."
01:32:45;01:32:48;"- Or was it like hooked up kind of like boxing style?"
01:32:48;01:32:52;"- Yeah, no, it's yeah, because they were hooked up good scenes."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"- You say what's up to the guy from Goose?"
01:32:54;01:32:55;"- Yeah."
01:33:15;01:33:17;"- You know, I thought actually earlier today"
01:33:17;01:33:21;"it was on my calendar for next week, I think."
01:33:21;01:33:23;"Maybe it was supposed to be today even."
01:33:23;01:33:26;"We were supposed to go see Bruce Springsteen at the Forum."
01:33:26;01:33:28;"- Oh yeah, I had that on my calendar too."
01:33:28;01:33:31;"- Or at SoFi or whatever, one of those venues."
01:33:31;01:33:32;"- Yeah."
01:33:32;01:33:35;"- Well, actually we were supposed to do Aerosmith"
01:33:35;01:33:37;"and then Bruce back to back nights."
01:33:37;01:33:39;"And then both."
01:33:39;01:33:40;"We were texting about this."
01:33:40;01:33:44;"Like we truly are at the end of like the rock legend era."
01:33:44;01:33:47;"Because both shows were canceled due to like health problems."
01:33:47;01:33:48;"- Exactly."
01:33:48;01:33:50;"- With Steve and Tyler."
01:33:50;01:33:51;"- Yeah."
01:33:51;01:33:52;"- And Bruce."
01:33:52;01:33:55;"- I hope Steve and Tyler and Bruce both bounce back soon."
01:33:55;01:33:57;"I'd love to catch them both next year."
01:33:57;01:34:01;"- Because we put that on the calendar in like June or something."
01:34:01;01:34:03;"And it seemed so far away."
01:34:03;01:34:06;"I'm like, okay, dude, Bruce, December 6th, like at the Forum."
01:34:06;01:34:08;"- Yeah, both canceled."
01:34:08;01:34:10;"Crazy."
01:34:10;01:34:12;"That's what happens when you wait too late to see the legends."
01:34:12;01:34:15;"- I've seen Bruce, never seen Aerosmith."
01:34:15;01:34:17;"You've seen Bruce, right?"
01:34:17;01:34:18;"- No, I've actually never had."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"- Wow."
01:34:19;01:34:21;"- I almost feel like I have, but I haven't."
01:34:21;01:34:26;"- I saw Bruce on the Rising Tour in 2002 or 2003."
01:34:26;01:34:27;"And that seemed late."
01:34:27;01:34:30;"I mean, he was only in his 50s then, which is amazing."
01:34:30;01:34:32;"He was like eight years older than I am now."
01:34:32;01:34:34;"- And did you enjoy the show?"
01:34:34;01:34:35;"- Yeah, it was great."
01:34:35;01:34:37;"I mean, it was just like --"
01:34:37;01:34:41;"I remember just like being kind of on like the -- in the GA area."
01:34:41;01:34:44;"It's kind of like I finally like -- I was with a friend or two."
01:34:44;01:34:48;"And we kind of like found our way like pretty close up to the stage."
01:34:48;01:34:51;"And we were screaming, ""Bobby Jean, Bobby Jean."""
01:34:51;01:34:53;"And he finally went into Bobby Jean."
01:34:53;01:34:55;"Two, three, four."
01:34:55;01:34:56;"- You think he did it for you?"
01:34:56;01:34:58;"- No, we weren't that close."
01:34:58;01:35:00;"There was no way he heard us."
01:35:00;01:35:01;"But it was awesome."
01:35:01;01:35:04;"I mean, that was in the era that I was really like discovering Bruce too."
01:35:04;01:35:08;"Like really like, you know, going deep on the whole discography."
01:35:08;01:35:11;"But anyway, that was like 22 years ago."
01:35:11;01:35:15;"That's right when Airport 5 came out."
01:35:15;01:35:18;"- All right, Jake, we got your number two most listened to."
01:35:18;01:35:19;"We're getting to the top now."
01:35:19;01:35:20;"- Yep."
01:35:20;01:35:23;"- Number two most listened to song from Jake,"
01:35:23;01:35:26;"Gene Clark, ""Fair and Tender Ladies."""
01:35:26;01:35:28;"- Hell yeah."
01:35:28;01:35:30;"- When did this come out?"
01:35:30;01:35:31;"- '87."
01:35:31;01:35:33;"- This is actually from '87? Whoa."
01:35:33;01:35:37;"- Yeah, it's from the ""So Rebellious a Lover"" album he did with Carla Olsen."
01:35:37;01:35:40;"It's a duets album."
01:35:40;01:35:43;"- So you had a big Gene Clark thing this year?"
01:35:43;01:35:45;"- Yeah, I mean."
01:35:45;01:35:55;"I would say this fall I went very heavy on the Gene Clark when I was working."
01:35:55;01:35:57;"Just all his records."
01:35:57;01:36:04;"And this one is like his last record in a way."
01:36:04;01:36:09;"And it has that sort of kind of sterile 1987 production."
01:36:09;01:36:11;"So I'd almost kind of avoided it."
01:36:11;01:36:14;"I got into this whole record this summer."
01:36:14;01:36:18;"Because it was the only one I didn't really know, like the back of my hand already."
01:36:18;01:36:33;"I do remember one time when I was really in the zone with painting."
01:36:33;01:36:35;"So I listened to this song 16 times this year."
01:36:35;01:36:39;"I just kept hitting the back button."
01:36:39;01:36:42;"I just loved the tempo and the feel."
01:36:42;01:36:46;"I think I listened to it five or six times in a row one day."
01:36:46;01:36:48;"Got those stats up."
01:36:48;01:37:02;"But yeah, this is like an update on an old song."
01:37:02;01:37:04;"- Yeah, interesting."
01:37:04;01:37:06;"- He changes it."
01:37:06;01:37:10;"- He talks about being from Missouri, which he is from Missouri."
01:37:10;01:37:13;"- Wait, he just said I'd rather be in some dark hollow."
01:37:13;01:37:17;"Is this kind of the same song as dark hollow?"
01:37:17;01:37:20;"- I'm in a dark hollow headspace, man."
01:37:20;01:37:23;"Here we go."
01:37:23;01:37:26;"Here in Missouri"
01:37:26;01:37:31;"With your memories"
01:37:31;01:37:36;"Always haunting my mind"
01:37:36;01:37:41;"Come on, ye fair"
01:37:41;01:37:46;"And tender ladies"
01:37:46;01:37:50;"Take one in hand"
01:37:51;01:37:56;"- I think I sent you guys a screen grab of Gene Kirk's wiki."
01:37:56;01:38:00;"It was like, born 1944, Missouri."
01:38:00;01:38:05;"Dies 1991, 46 years old in Sherman Oaks, California."
01:38:05;01:38:07;"- Sherman Oaks, yeah."
01:38:07;01:38:08;"- I'm 46 now."
01:38:08;01:38:09;"- Wow."
01:38:09;01:38:11;"- He was the third of 13 children."
01:38:11;01:38:14;"Born in 1940s Missouri."
01:38:14;01:38:18;"And then by the mid 60s, when he's like 20, 21,"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"he's a huge rock star with the birds."
01:38:21;01:38:24;"And then he leaves the birds in '66."
01:38:24;01:38:26;"So early."
01:38:26;01:38:30;"And then eventually he moved up to the deep Mendocino coast."
01:38:30;01:38:36;"Yeah, if I was an independent filmmaker,"
01:38:36;01:38:40;"I would do a Sofia Coppola style movie about a guy."
01:38:40;01:38:41;"- Gene Clark?"
01:38:41;01:38:43;"- About a Gene Clark style guy."
01:38:43;01:38:45;"Instead of somewhere,"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"it'd be like,"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"yeah, a guy from like the rural Midwest"
01:38:50;01:38:54;"that's specifically about recording his final album in 1987."
01:38:54;01:38:55;"- That's pretty good."
01:38:55;01:38:57;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:38:57;01:39:01;"And tender ladies"
01:39:01;01:39:02;"- Yeah, this is beautiful."
01:39:02;01:39:05;"- His voice is so sad."
01:39:05;01:39:06;"- It always was."
01:39:06;01:39:10;"You caught your man"
01:39:10;01:39:16;"- Have you gone deep on any of those 70s Gene Clark records?"
01:39:16;01:39:19;"- No, what's that one that everybody loves?"
01:39:19;01:39:22;"- There's Roadmaster, there's No Other,"
01:39:22;01:39:23;"there's Two Sides to Every Story."
01:39:23;01:39:24;"- Oh, No Other."
01:39:24;01:39:25;"- There's No Other."
01:39:25;01:39:27;"- And there's the self-titled,"
01:39:27;01:39:29;"there's the light, light one,"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"or whatever it's called, self-titled."
01:39:31;01:39:36;"- He's got like four really good records."
01:39:36;01:39:38;"- Yeah, With Tomorrow's a beautiful song."
01:39:38;01:39:40;"And then Strength of Strength is cool."
01:39:40;01:39:44;"- I mean, I wouldn't say it's depressive music,"
01:39:44;01:39:46;"but it's, it verges on it."
01:39:46;01:39:59;"But he had so much, he had so many beautiful songs."
01:39:59;01:40:01;"Anyway, big Gene head."
01:40:04;01:40:18;"- Little fade out."
01:40:18;01:40:19;"- Yeah."
01:40:19;01:40:20;"- Lovely."
01:40:20;01:40:21;"My number two song,"
01:40:21;01:40:24;"I can't remember if I played this on the show before."
01:40:24;01:40:28;"I know we talked about it a little bit, Jake, on text."
01:40:28;01:40:29;"I sent you the original."
01:40:29;01:40:34;"But there was a big Bob Dylan volume of it"
01:40:34;01:40:35;"from his bootleg series,"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"which they've been doing since the nineties,"
01:40:37;01:40:40;"'cause he has so many unreleased studio recordings,"
01:40:40;01:40:42;"demos, whatever."
01:40:42;01:40:44;"And so there's a song, Mississippi,"
01:40:44;01:40:49;"which was recorded around the time of Time Out of Mind."
01:40:49;01:40:52;"And it didn't make that album, it made his next album."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"Some people consider Mississippi"
01:40:54;01:40:58;"to be one of his late masterpieces."
01:40:58;01:40:59;"- Top shelf."
01:40:59;01:41:03;"- Yeah, in fact, even when I've been like going deep"
01:41:03;01:41:04;"on like Bob Dylan books,"
01:41:04;01:41:07;"somebody wrote a book that's specifically"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"about the song Mississippi,"
01:41:09;01:41:12;"like the story of Bob Dylan's late masterpiece."
01:41:12;01:41:15;"Matt, can you throw the Love and Theft version"
01:41:15;01:41:16;"of Mississippi on for a second,"
01:41:16;01:41:17;"just to give some context?"
01:41:17;01:41:21;"So I'd heard the song before and I'd never connected that."
01:41:21;01:41:24;"I could tell, I was like, this is a good song."
01:41:24;01:41:26;"I never connected that deeply to it."
