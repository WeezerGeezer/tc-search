00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, ask me anything."
00:04;00:08;"It's time to open the floodgates"
00:08;00:14;"and let the TC heads ask Jake and I about what really matters."
00:14;00:20;"Too often has this show been bound by the rigid structures of late night news."
00:20;00:23;"Finally, we're gonna go on some flights of fancy"
00:23;00:26;"and let the show take us wherever it wants to go."
00:26;00:31;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:31;00:35;"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:35;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:43;00:50;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:50;00:57;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:57;01:04;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go."
01:04;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:09;01:14;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:14;01:19;"He's the lonely man."
01:19;01:21;"It's Time Crisis back once again."
01:21;01:24;"And guess what? We're down in the bank."
01:24;01:25;"What's up, Jake?"
01:25;01:26;"Hey, man."
01:26;01:30;"Look, this summer, this spring summer was a real time crisis."
01:30;01:32;"We were all over the map, man."
01:32;01:36;"I was everywhere from Minneapolis to Poland."
01:36;01:37;"So we had to bank some EPS."
01:37;01:38;"Sounds like a song, right?"
01:38;01:40;"Banking the EPS?"
01:40;01:43;"From Minneapolis to Poland."
01:43;01:45;"Mama, I've been banking the EPS."
01:45;01:48;"I think ultimately, though, banking the EPS hasn't been a bad thing."
01:48;01:49;"No, it's been fun."
01:49;01:51;"I think we've gotten some really good banked EPS."
01:51;01:55;"And, you know, we'll get back to a little more, you know, some more timely conversations."
01:55;02:01;"But the truth is, I think Time Crisis needed some pauses to bank some EPS,"
02:01;02:05;"dig back into the mailbag as we did on one banked EPS, do a subway series."
02:05;02:07;"You know, we've been doing all sorts of interesting stuff."
02:07;02:11;"It's really challenged us creatively."
02:11;02:17;"So on this banked EPS, which was recorded at an undisclosed location in an undisclosed time,"
02:17;02:21;"who knows, it could have been yesterday, could have been three years ago, who knows."
02:21;02:25;"We're going to kind of center this one around an AMA,"
02:25;02:29;"because a lot of times on Time Crisis we're talking about the news of the day."
02:29;02:33;"We're getting into that razor sharp analysis."
02:33;02:37;"We don't always have time to kind of get into it, talk to the fans, you know."
02:37;02:41;"We don't have time to really stretch out and go on flights of fancy, you know."
02:41;02:47;"We're doing a Rachel Maddow style news program, and, you know, there's just things we have to get through."
02:47;02:48;"Highly planned."
02:48;02:52;"Highly planned. We don't always have time to just shoot the s***,"
02:52;02:57;"just talk about life or, you know, chase an idea down a little rabbit hole."
02:57;02:59;"We don't always have time for that."
02:59;03:01;"And that's what I love about these banked EPS."
03:01;03:04;"We can break from the format a little bit and kind of just stretch out."
03:54;04:06;"So anyway, we haven't done this in a long time."
04:06;04:09;"We haven't done any sort of AMA thing with the fans."
04:09;04:12;"That's always a good way to trigger conversation, you know."
04:12;04:14;"So this banked EPS is the AMA EPS."
04:14;04:18;"And Seinfeld, you've been asking the fans for good questions."
04:18;04:20;"Did you give them any parameters?"
04:20;04:23;"No, I just said, you know, we're in the studio right now."
04:23;04:26;"Whatever you want to ask, just fire away."
04:26;04:28;"So no parameters, no limits, no boundaries, really."
04:28;04:31;"Okay, cool. So where to start?"
04:31;04:34;"Well, how do we even organize? How many of you you've gotten so far?"
04:34;04:36;"About 150."
04:36;04:37;"Oh, that's a lot."
04:37;04:39;"I mean, we're all over the map."
04:39;04:41;"I really should have set some boundaries."
04:41;04:44;"There are questions about, you know, Vampire Weekend, about food,"
04:44;04:48;"other artists that we haven't really touched on that much on the show."
04:48;04:51;"Some stuff for just for Jake about his art."
04:51;04:53;"Let's start with a Jake question, kick things off."
04:53;04:54;"All right."
04:54;04:59;"So the question comes from @KaleDinosaur."
04:59;05:01;"Good name."
05:01;05:04;"What's Jake working on in the studio right now?"
05:04;05:07;"I'd also enjoy a deep dive into Jake's art in general."
05:07;05:09;"That's true."
05:09;05:12;"Well, I'm working on a show that's going to be opening in September"
05:12;05:15;"at Nino Meyer Gallery in Los Angeles."
05:15;05:19;"One room of architecture paintings, one room of landscape paintings."
05:19;05:22;"I'm working on a painting of an office max right now."
05:22;05:24;"It's six by seven feet."
05:24;05:25;"Big. Huge."
05:25;05:27;"It'll be a painting of a Toys R Us."
05:27;05:30;"It'll be a painting of a Circuit City."
05:30;05:33;"Question, is the Toys R Us in business?"
05:33;05:34;"Nope."
05:34;05:36;"This is a closed down Toys R Us you're painting."
05:36;05:37;"Indeed."
05:37;05:38;"Can you sense the abandonment?"
05:38;05:40;"Can you sense that it's closed down?"
05:40;05:43;"Yeah, there's plywood over the doors, and the sign has been removed,"
05:43;05:48;"but there's like that sort of like ghost of the Toys R Us logo written in filth."
05:48;05:49;"Yeah."
05:49;05:50;"You know when you--"
05:50;05:51;"Right, right."
05:51;05:52;"Grime."
05:52;05:53;"Yeah."
05:53;05:54;"Was that from a photographing one?"
05:54;05:57;"That's an image--it was based on an image I found online"
05:57;06:01;"because I will sometimes just Google image search Quiznos Orlando."
06:01;06:02;"See what pops up."
06:02;06:03;"See what you get."
06:03;06:04;"Yeah."
06:04;06:06;"So I'm working on stuff like that, big paintings."
06:06;06:11;"Actually, leading into that, there's a question from Prairie Goth, Prairie_Goth."
06:11;06:14;"I'm in art school, and it's a wild ride."
06:14;06:18;"What's @Dongstrath's best art school memory?"
06:18;06:24;"Doing a field trip to Las Vegas with Larry Sultan, RIP."
06:24;06:25;"Who's that, a professor?"
06:25;06:29;"Yeah, he was a legendary photographer and teacher."
06:29;06:31;"Academics love Las Vegas."
06:31;06:32;"He took us to Vegas."
06:32;06:33;"It was super fun."
06:33;06:34;"Learning from Las Vegas."
06:34;06:35;"Isn't that like a book?"
06:35;06:37;"Yeah, that's--"
06:37;06:38;"Rem Koolhaas or like an architect?"
06:38;06:40;"No, it's like Venturi, and I forget the name."
06:40;06:41;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right."
06:41;06:46;"It's like a pair of writers, and they wrote about the vernacular architecture"
06:46;06:47;"of the American West."
06:47;06:50;"And there's also--there's an academic whose name is like--oh, God,"
06:50;06:52;"I'm going to get Robert Mackey or something."
06:52;06:56;"There's like a professor at the University of Las Vegas who writes art criticism,"
06:56;06:57;"and I remember--"
06:57;06:58;"Oh, Dave Hickey."
06:58;06:59;"Dave Hickey, yeah, Dave Hickey."
06:59;07:00;"Dave Hickey is awesome."
07:00;07:02;"In fact, we tried to meet him."
07:02;07:06;"Larry knew him a little bit and tried calling him,"
07:06;07:08;"or we went to his office, but we didn't cross paths."
07:08;07:09;"Yeah."
07:09;07:10;"Well, you know, so while we're on the subject,"
07:10;07:14;"because I don't want this episode just to be like question, question, question,"
07:14;07:15;"what's art school all about?"
07:15;07:18;"I think both these questions point to something, Jake."
07:18;07:21;"Everybody who listens to TC knows that you're an American painter"
07:21;07:22;"and radio personality."
07:22;07:25;"But we actually--and maybe I don't even have all the answers--"
07:25;07:28;"know your full back story as a painter."
07:28;07:29;"Yeah."
07:29;07:30;"You're a musician, too."
07:30;07:34;"You've played in bands, guitarists, written songs."
07:34;07:38;"What was your path to painting becoming like your medium?"
07:38;07:41;"Because at some point, you're like a creative dude."
07:41;07:43;"You've done a lot of different things."
07:43;07:47;"Was it always obvious that you were just going to--that painting was like the thing?"
07:47;07:52;"I mean, since I was a kid, I was always into two-dimensional art."
07:52;07:55;"I was always into drawing and painting."
07:55;08:00;"I mean, I guess the painting didn't really start in earnest until like college years."
08:00;08:05;"But definitely high school was a lot of drawing, baseball players, making comic books."
08:05;08:06;"And then--"
08:06;08:09;"And then in college, did you major in fine art?"
08:09;08:11;"I majored in art, and then I chose painting."
08:11;08:16;"I remember I was divided between graphic design, which seemed very practical,"
08:16;08:17;"and then painting."
08:17;08:19;"I remember the graphic design teacher was a cool guy,"
08:19;08:22;"but I remember him making fun of the fine artists and the painters"
08:22;08:24;"for being impractical."
08:24;08:25;"That's what put you over the edge?"
08:25;08:27;"I was sort of like, ""Uh,"" but it's--"
08:27;08:30;"I thought it was just nerdy and kind of lame to do that."
08:30;08:31;"And like, ""What am I going to do?"
08:31;08:34;"Oh, I could design a label for a soft drink?"""
08:34;08:37;"I remember I was working on a redesign of the Mountain Dew logo."
08:37;08:39;"Oh, wait. I think you have a reference to that book."
08:39;08:40;"It was a project."
08:40;08:41;"I remember thinking--"
08:41;08:42;"I mean, that sounds pretty tight."
08:42;08:43;"And I was like, ""Painting is cooler."""
08:43;08:44;"Wait, wait, but he--"
08:44;08:45;"But I had no idea what it meant."
08:45;08:47;"Like, the art world is very oblique."
08:47;08:48;"Yeah."
08:48;08:51;"I wasn't like, ""I'm going to make a living painting,"" when I was 22."
08:51;08:53;"You were just like, ""I have to choose a major."""
08:53;08:57;"Yeah, because some people have their relationship to their major being like,"
08:57;08:59;"""I'm going to be a computer science major,"
08:59;09:02;"and I'm going to get a job writing code, and that's cool."""
09:02;09:03;"I was an art major."

10:48;10:50;"I mean, I have to say, there wasn't, like,"
10:50;10:52;"there wasn't, like, a clear plan of attack."
10:52;10:55;"And I think that's true of most art majors."
10:55;10:56;"What was your major?"
10:56;10:58;"English. Pretty similar."
10:58;10:59;"Yeah, it's very similar."
10:59;11:01;"Yeah, I think I got to college..."
11:01;11:04;"I don't know if deep down I always believed"
11:04;11:06;"that I would end up being a musician,"
11:06;11:08;"or I hoped-- maybe I didn't want to admit it,"
11:08;11:10;"but I hoped deep down, like, that's where I'd end up,"
11:10;11:13;"'cause I was fairly serious in high school"
11:13;11:15;"outside of my sophomore year."
11:15;11:16;"I don't know why."
11:16;11:18;"I just, like, got some Bs my sophomore year."
11:18;11:21;"But the rest of high school, I, like, took it seriously,"
11:21;11:24;"'cause I had this vague sense, ""Okay, you need to do well"
11:24;11:26;"in high school so you can go to a good college."""
11:26;11:27;"'Cause I remember in, like, middle school,"
11:27;11:29;"sometimes my parents would be hard on me, like,"
11:29;11:32;"""Oh, you didn't study for your 8th grade social studies test?"""
11:32;11:34;"And I remember at the time just being like,"
11:34;11:35;"""Guys, come on."
11:35;11:37;"This literally doesn't count for anything."
11:37;11:38;"It's gonna work out."""
11:38;11:41;"- And I understand from the point of view of parents"
11:41;11:43;"probably being like, ""That doesn't sound very promising."""
11:43;11:44;"But that's how I felt."
11:44;11:46;"So then I was like, ""When I get to my freshman year,"
11:46;11:47;"I'm gonna tighten [bleep] up."""
11:47;11:48;"And my freshman year, I did."
11:48;11:50;"I started getting good grades. - Look at you."
11:50;11:51;"- I got it together."
11:51;11:52;"Then my sophomore year,"
11:52;11:54;"it's like a couple classes I hated,"
11:54;11:56;"and, you know, I dipped a little bit."
11:56;11:57;"But then my junior year,"
11:57;11:59;"I also knew that junior year is, like, really important."
11:59;12:02;"And again, I got real focused, and I got good grades,"
12:02;12:05;"because I knew I needed to go to, like, a good school."
12:05;12:07;"That seemed important. - Mm-hmm."
12:07;12:09;"- Even when I was applying to schools,"
12:09;12:11;"I think I just had a sense of, like,"
12:11;12:14;"I should go to a good East Coast school."
12:14;12:17;"I didn't really have any interest in, like, leaving the area."
12:17;12:18;"- Tri-state boy."
12:18;12:19;"- I was pretty tri-state."
12:19;12:21;"Or at least, like, New England."
12:21;12:22;"I don't know. Yeah, it's funny."
12:22;12:23;"- Did you apply to Yale?"
12:23;12:25;"- I didn't apply to Yale. I don't know why."
12:25;12:28;"I think I went to Yale once, and I was just like, ""Hmm."""
12:28;12:29;"- Yeah."
12:29;12:31;"- I think I went to Yale, and my first thought was,"
12:31;12:33;"""Connecticut's not really pulling its weight"
12:33;12:35;"in the tri-state area musical history."
12:35;12:36;"Not gonna go here."""
12:36;12:37;"- Fair point."
12:37;12:39;"- I think I applied to, like, seven or eight schools."
12:39;12:41;"Yeah, I think that's a thing that, over the years,"
12:41;12:43;"kids started applying to more and more schools."
12:43;12:44;"- Yeah."
12:44;12:45;"- Like, how many schools did you apply to?"
12:45;12:46;"- I think five."
12:46;12:48;"- And I guess you also applied to a lot of schools"
12:48;12:50;"'cause you want to see, like, who gives you the better deal."
12:50;12:51;"- Sure."
12:51;12:52;"- Financial aid and stuff like that."
12:52;12:55;"If I can remember, I applied to Princeton."
12:55;12:56;"- Damn, dude."
12:56;12:57;"- Oh, no, I applied to Harvard."
12:57;12:58;"- Look at you."
12:58;12:59;"- Yo, I didn't get in."
12:59;13:00;"I got wait-listed."
13:00;13:03;"I applied to Harvard, Princeton, Columbia Brown,"
13:03;13:05;"Wesleyan, Amherst."
13:05;13:06;"- Oh, CT."
13:06;13:07;"- Yeah, two CT schools."
13:07;13:09;"I might have applied to Vassar, actually,"
13:09;13:10;"now that I think about it,"
13:10;13:13;"and maybe NYU or something."
13:13;13:14;"- Top shelf."
13:14;13:15;"- Well, I think that's what--"
13:15;13:17;"- You did very well junior year."
13:17;13:19;"- I did well my junior year,"
13:19;13:21;"and then I got in everywhere"
13:21;13:23;"except for Princeton and Harvard."
13:23;13:24;"Thank God."
13:24;13:25;"- Wow, dude."
13:25;13:27;"- Honestly, it would have sucked going to those schools."
13:27;13:29;"I mean, even Columbia, borderline,"
13:29;13:30;"I sometimes look back on it,"
13:30;13:32;"and I'm like, ""Why did I care about, like,"
13:32;13:34;"going to, like, one of these dip-[bleep] Ivy League schools?"""
13:34;13:36;"I don't really have, like, pride in it."
13:36;13:37;"- Yeah."
13:37;13:39;"- I'm lucky that I met the right mix of people."
13:39;13:40;"There are so many whack people, too."
13:40;13:42;"It's like, I can't have pride about, like,"
13:42;13:44;"a school I went to for four years."
13:44;13:47;"I could have pride about, like, a region or something,"
13:47;13:48;"but the--"
13:48;13:50;"- I've never understood that people are, like,"
13:50;13:53;"super fired up to be alumni"
13:53;13:54;"or, like, super involved in, like,"
13:54;13:56;"the alumni organizations of a school."
13:56;13:57;"I never--"
13:57;13:58;"- I could understand it if, like,"
13:58;14:03;"if only to maybe help give access to the school"
14:03;14:04;"to underprivileged people."
14:04;14:06;"I could understand if there's, like, a social element"
14:06;14:07;"where you're kind of like, ""Listen,"
14:07;14:08;"this school changed my whole life,"
14:08;14:11;"and I want to make sure that people like me get--"""
14:11;14:12;"You know, like, that kind of story?"
14:12;14:13;"- Sure."
14:13;14:14;"- Is kind of, like, heartwarming,"
14:14;14:16;"but versus just that pure pride?"
14:16;14:17;"- Yeah."
14:17;14:18;"- I'm just like--"
14:18;14:19;"It's like, ""What the hell?"""
14:19;14:20;"So at the end of the day, for me,"
14:20;14:23;"it really came down to Columbia versus Brown."

16:49;16:52;"Just kind of like actual biographical story,"
16:52;16:54;"which is good because I don't think we do that much."
16:54;16:57;"A little boring, but also just kind of giving some of those details."
16:57;17:02;"I was actually thinking about that recently because I've been reading Phil Lesch's autobiography."
17:02;17:03;"Nice."
17:03;17:07;"I really thought my appetite for Grateful Dead books would be quelled by now."
17:07;17:08;"Turns out it's insatiable."
17:08;17:10;"Turns out it's insatiable."
17:10;17:13;"Although there is a part of it that's like with some of these things,"
17:13;17:16;"by the time that Phil Lesch gets to describing Ultimont,"
17:16;17:21;"and he's even just being like, ""Ultimont was the ultimate comedown for the 1960s after Woodstock."""
17:21;17:23;"I'm just like, ""Okay, all right."""
17:23;17:26;"I've heard this literally a thousand times in my life."
17:26;17:31;"But then the parts I love is just him talking about the kind of boring early life."
17:31;17:36;"Then I changed high schools, and my parents moved from Oakland to Berkeley,"
17:36;17:39;"and then I started going to a local community college,"
17:39;17:42;"and then on the weekends I started going down to Palo Alto."
17:42;17:43;"I like those kind of details."
17:43;17:48;"So there's a part of me that as I read that stuff, even when he says stuff that's like--"
17:48;17:51;"If I was writing a book, I'd be like, ""Why are you putting this in?"""
17:51;17:55;"Where he's just telling-- And on our first trip to New York we did this, and then we did this,"
17:55;17:58;"and then we actually saw Frank Zappa perform."
17:58;18:02;"And I got to say, when I saw him play, it doesn't really help tell the story of his life,"
18:02;18:05;"and yet you're like, ""That is the good sh*t."""
18:05;18:06;"That's interesting detail."
18:06;18:11;"And also it's good just to have on record, at least for dudes like us,"
18:11;18:17;"I do kind of want to know that Phil and Jerry sat and watched Frank Zappa play in 1966"
18:17;18:19;"when they first went to New York or whatever."
18:19;18:20;"Yeah, that's gold."
18:20;18:27;"Anyway, I guess I'm saying this internet radio podcast will have just some of those real dry details."
18:27;18:32;"Guys, strap in. This is going to be a very boring, very dry episode."
18:32;18:34;"Because the truth is, if I think about--"
18:34;18:39;"Well, again, I don't want to assume that all TC heads are VW heads, because as we know, that's not true."
18:39;18:42;"But I'm interested in maybe where people applied to college,"
18:42;18:44;"or if they didn't go to college, or if they didn't apply."
18:44;18:45;"I'm interested in the backstory."
18:45;18:49;"But also like you, obviously as I'm saying this, it was fairly thoughtless."
18:49;18:53;"I was like, ""These are good schools that are not too far away."""
18:53;18:56;"And then at the end, I was like, ""Brown versus Columbia, they both seem pretty good."""
18:56;18:59;"You go take a tour of these schools, and you're just kind of like,"
18:59;19:02;"""Just like dumb sh*t that they're showing you. Oh, and this is the pool."""
19:02;19:04;"It's like, ""Oh, how does that work?"""
19:04;19:07;"And it's like, ""Well, if you're a student, you just roll up with your ID. You can swim all the time."""
19:07;19:09;"And guess what? It's open until 9."
19:09;19:13;"Whereas the actual real choice is between Providence and New York City."
19:13;19:14;"Yes."
19:14;19:15;"That's the real choice you're making."
19:15;19:16;"And thank God I figured that out."
19:16;19:17;"Yeah."
19:17;19:19;"Because I remember at the time being like,"
19:19;19:21;"""And again, I don't even know what the f*ck I was talking about."""
19:21;19:23;"I'd be like, ""Well, what are you interested in?"""
19:23;19:24;"""I guess I'm interested in music."""
19:24;19:29;"""Well, New York obviously has a lot going on with music, but does Providence have a scene?"""
19:29;19:32;"I'm like, ""Yeah, I don't know. My friend told me about this band called Lightning Bolt."""
19:32;19:34;"Yeah, man. Fort Thunder."
19:34;19:37;"And I'm just like, ""What the f*ck am I even talking about?"""
19:37;19:39;"Just the idea that that..."
19:39;19:40;"Right."
19:40;19:42;"I don't know. Maybe it is a big deal."
19:42;19:45;"Maybe there is somebody who went to Brown and they saw a show at Fort Thunder"
19:45;19:48;"and they got in the Lightning Bolt and that changed the course of their life."
19:48;19:49;"I don't know."
19:49;19:51;"I'm sure there is someone like that."
19:51;19:53;"But even the fact that I was in New York, I went to shows,"
19:53;19:56;"it really is just that I met people that I started a band with."
19:56;19:57;"That's the important part."
19:57;20:00;"The fact that I was in New York and saw..."
20:00;20:03;"I'm sure I saw some noise shows with some of my friends too."
20:03;20:05;"I could have seen that in Providence. I could have seen that in Boston."
20:05;20:07;"Bands go on tour, you know?"
20:07;20:12;"The scene already was kind of lacking importance then."
20:12;20:15;"The first thing that a band does is start to travel a little bit,"
20:15;20:18;"even if it's just locally, up and down the East Coast."
20:18;20:21;"Yeah, so then I think at some point I was like, ""Yeah, I think I'd rather be in New York."""
20:21;20:23;"And then I just ended up there."
20:23;20:27;"And then I think when I applied, you fill out, ""What are you interested in majoring in?"""
20:27;20:29;"And I liked biology and I got good grades in biology,"
20:29;20:31;"so I put evolutionary biology."
20:31;20:32;"Damn."
20:32;20:36;"As soon as I got there, I was just like, ""Uh, I don't know."""
20:36;20:41;"You just take random classes like film, intro to film."
20:41;20:42;"I like movies."
20:42;20:43;"College, dude."
20:43;20:44;"Yeah."
20:44;20:47;"Took an economics class and I was like, ""This is interesting,"
20:47;20:50;"but also kind of like a pain in the ass doing your homework."
20:50;20:51;"It's kind of annoying."""
20:51;20:53;"For some reason, I minored in economics."
20:53;20:54;"I didn't know that."
20:54;20:56;"See, we're getting into some real sh*t on this one."
20:56;20:58;"Jake with the econ minor."
20:58;21:03;"Microeconomics, macroeconomics, environmental economics."
21:03;21:04;"Baskets."
21:04;21:06;"Baskets of goods."
22:40;22:45;"Yeah, that's a truly pointless field of study because--"
22:45;22:47;"It's not even a science."
22:47;22:49;"Well, yeah, it's just a bunch of theories."
22:49;22:50;"It's like evolution."
22:50;22:54;"I don't remember anything about it."
22:54;22:56;"I don't know why I did that."
22:56;22:58;"Maybe because I was like being an art major and I was like,"
22:58;23:02;"""I got to balance that with something 'practical',"""
23:02;23:04;"having no idea what that means."
23:04;23:05;"That's a classic."
23:05;23:09;"And also, you minored."
23:09;23:12;"Just to minor in something is so--"
23:12;23:13;"Truly pointless."
23:13;23:16;"I've been thinking so much post the college scandal"
23:16;23:19;"how college is just so pointless."
23:19;23:21;"I don't want to say that because obviously there's certain things"
23:21;23:22;"you need training for,"
23:22;23:25;"but I feel like one of the defining characteristics of our generation"
23:25;23:29;"is that so many people were told they needed to go to college"
23:29;23:31;"and then graduated significantly in debt."
23:31;23:32;"Right."
23:32;23:35;"And there's a lot of people really questioning was it worth it."
23:35;23:37;"And either by the time you get out of debt, so much time has passed"
23:37;23:39;"that you're kind of like, ""What the f--- was that?"""
23:39;23:44;"Or you just were sold this idea that it's worth going into debt"
23:44;23:46;"so that you can study and enrich."
23:46;23:48;"There's a lot of reasons that people are already questioning that,"
23:48;23:51;"and I think exactly when that college scandal hit"
23:51;23:54;"about people just paying their way into college,"
23:54;23:56;"it was the perfect moment for people just to be like,"
23:56;23:57;"""Man, what the f--- is this?"""
23:57;24:00;"To truly on a large scale question the whole institution."
24:00;24:02;"Yeah, throw up their hands."
24:02;24:04;"Yeah, when I think about the future, it's like,"
24:04;24:08;"in 20 years, will as many kids be going to college?"
24:08;24:09;"It might take on--"
24:09;24:11;"Not if the prices keep going the way they're going."
24:11;24:13;"Yeah, the price is not right."
24:13;24:16;"Plus, you've got internet, a full repository of all information"
24:16;24:18;"anytime you want to know something."
24:18;24:20;"Oh, internet, that's a portmanteau."
24:20;24:23;"Oh, right, an international Netscape."
24:23;24:26;"Yeah, you watch Info Wars and you take classes at University of Phoenix."
24:26;24:28;"I mean, you're going to be golden."
24:28;24:30;"Internet is a portmanteau for internet network."
24:30;24:33;"Seinfeld, what's the next question? Let's move on."
24:33;24:37;"All right. Gosh, so many good ones."
24:37;24:39;"I mean, maybe just for the sake of continuity,"
24:39;24:41;"now we've heard both of your backgrounds,"
24:41;24:44;"how did Jake and Ezra become friends?"
24:44;24:46;"I feel like we've covered this on the show."
24:46;24:47;"In detail."
24:47;24:48;"All right, we can move on."
24:48;24:50;"Well, we can give the quick answer."
24:50;24:53;"The quick answer is I met Dave, Jake's brother,"
24:53;24:56;"because I was in a noise band at Columbia."
24:56;24:59;"I played sax in a noise band called Total War,"
24:59;25:04;"and somehow they knew Dave, and they got a gig opening for Dave"
25:04;25:06;"on some little tour in the summer."
25:06;25:08;"Did you guys play Zebulon?"
25:08;25:11;"I don't remember playing Zebulon."
25:11;25:16;"We toured with Dave at weird kind of Midwestern art collective type spaces and stuff."
25:16;25:17;"So Total War."
25:17;25:18;"Total War."
25:18;25:19;"With you on sax."
25:19;25:22;"With me on sax, opened for Dave, who was performing solo as Dirty Projectors."
25:22;25:24;"So this was like '04?"
25:24;25:27;"Yeah, I think it was probably literally summer of '04."
25:27;25:31;"So I got to know Dave a little bit on that tour, and then we stayed in touch."
25:31;25:36;"Then the next summer, Dave asked, ""Did I want to play saxophone in his band, Dirty Projectors?"""
25:36;25:39;"because he was putting together a big band, and there's some saxophone parts."
25:39;25:42;"So I said, ""Sure,"" and then I went on tour with Dave."
25:42;25:48;"I did two tours with Dirty Projectors, but either way, one of them, Jake was also in the band."
25:48;25:50;"At that point, you had just graduated from art school."
25:50;25:52;"2005."
25:52;25:55;"And you were kind of like just wanted to kill a few weeks."
25:55;25:56;"I was 28."
25:56;25:59;"And you jumped on the road, and you were playing a little guitar"
25:59;26:01;"and helping with some electronic stuff."
26:01;26:03;"You were helping trigger a bass drum sound."
26:03;26:05;"Yeah, I don't know why I was doing that."
26:05;26:07;"I should have just played guitar."
26:07;26:09;"I was also driving a lot."
26:09;26:11;"I was just sort of there for--"
26:11;26:12;"Just helping out on the tour."
26:12;26:13;"--kind of vibes."
26:13;26:18;"So I remember being at a rehearsal and then being introduced and being like,"
26:18;26:20;"""Oh, this is Dave's brother, Jake."""
26:20;26:22;"Then we went on tour, and the rest is history."
26:22;26:23;"Fast friends."
26:24;26:27;"I remember Dave being like, ""Dude, you're going to love Ezra."
26:27;26:28;"This guy's classic."""

33:59;34:04;"Ezra, please talk about Lone Run's Pizza Party."
34:04;34:05;"Oh."
34:05;34:07;"[laughing]"
34:07;34:08;"You know that song, Jake?"
34:08;34:09;"I've heard the title."
34:09;34:11;"Well, Lone Run was in my rap group, and--"
34:11;34:12;"Right, okay."
34:12;34:15;"And then eventually I decided I couldn't, nor should I rap."
34:15;34:17;"But it was like kind of a fun song."
34:17;34:19;"Basically, this is my memory of it."
34:19;34:21;"Doing Lone Run for like a year or so, it's funny."
34:21;34:24;"Like, one of the last Lone Run songs I kind of made"
34:24;34:27;"was ""Giving Up the Gun,"" which became a Vampire Weekend song."
34:27;34:28;"Oh, whoa."
34:28;34:30;"So Lone Run started as like a rap group."
34:30;34:32;"It's like real goofy."
34:32;34:33;"But I think in the back of my head I felt like,"
34:33;34:36;"well, we could transition into something more serious, maybe."
34:36;34:41;"But I like the idea of making this goofy little funky song"
34:41;34:43;"found, like, I think it was built around"
34:43;34:45;"like a Yellow Magic Orchestra sample."
34:45;34:47;"And I know it's hard to believe,"
34:47;34:51;"but around 2003, there was something somewhat novel"
34:51;34:54;"about making a rap song about pizza."
34:54;34:56;"I know it's like so played out now."
34:56;34:58;"You know, it's like the same way--"
34:58;35:00;"Remember how in our lifetimes, being into bacon"
35:00;35:03;"kind of came and went?"
35:03;35:04;"Like, there was almost something avant-garde"
35:04;35:08;"about being into bacon in like 2005."
35:08;35:09;"Like Brooklyn restaurants?"
35:09;35:10;"A little bit."
35:10;35:12;"Like, leaning heavy into bacon?"
35:12;35:15;"Yeah, and now Donald Trump Jr. posts like,"
35:15;35:17;"""Bacon is good."""
35:17;35:19;"Like, you know, I'm just saying,"
35:19;35:20;"like, these things come and go."
35:20;35:24;"So being into pizza is like just so boring."
35:24;35:25;"It's like--it's almost like an"
35:25;35:27;"""Iken has cheeseburger"" cat meme."
35:27;35:30;"But I promise you, there was--"
35:30;35:33;"there was just a touch of novelty about it back then."
35:33;35:34;"So the idea of making a rap song about pizza"
35:34;35:37;"seemed vaguely fresh."
35:37;35:40;"So anyway, I just had this idea to make, like,"
35:40;35:43;"kind of like a goofy rap song about pizza."
35:43;35:45;"And truly, there was something about, like,"
35:45;35:46;"trying to rap and write--"
35:46;35:49;"it's got my brain working about lyrics in a way."
35:49;35:52;"And the chorus went, ""P-I-Z-Z-A-P-R-T-Y."
35:52;35:54;"If you got a blunt, then we can get high."
35:54;35:56;"If you want to come, then pick up the phone."
35:56;35:59;"Don't get caught with the wack calzone."""
35:59;36:01;"Like, wack calzone, it was, like, funny to me back then."
36:01;36:03;"And we would, like, perform it sometimes."
36:03;36:05;"We made a recording of it."
36:05;36:06;"And then I just remember listening,"
36:06;36:08;"thinking about it one day."
36:08;36:09;"I was taking a nap or something,"
36:09;36:11;"and I kind of woke up from the nap,"
36:11;36:14;"and I realized I didn't spell it correctly."
36:14;36:18;"P-I-Z-Z-A-P-R-T--it's P-A-R-T-Y."
36:18;36:19;"And I think I forgot about the A"
36:19;36:22;"'cause the word ""R"" has the full sound in it of the syllable."
36:22;36:23;"Uh-huh."
36:23;36:24;"P-R--and then I realized--"
36:24;36:26;"and then I kind of lost enthusiasm for it"
36:26;36:28;"when I realized my error."
36:28;36:29;"In the whole band?"
36:29;36:30;"A little bit."
36:30;36:31;"Well, when you were young,"
36:31;36:33;"you kind of cycled through bands quickly."
36:33;36:34;"Yeah, it's like--"
36:34;36:35;"You were in Total War."
36:35;36:36;"You were in--what was that band named?"
36:36;36:37;"La Homme?"
36:37;36:38;"La Homme Run."
36:38;36:39;"Yeah, it was, like, French. La Homme."
36:39;36:40;"What other bands were you in?"
36:40;36:42;"I remember there's one performance"
36:42;36:45;"of my kind of Fairport Convention-style"
36:45;36:49;"British folk group that was called Ezra and the Thanes."
36:49;36:50;"I didn't have time to think of a good name,"
36:50;36:51;"so Ezra and the Thanes."
36:51;36:53;"And I think we performed a couple, like,"
36:53;36:56;"Irish folk songs in a basement in Brooklyn,"
36:56;36:58;"and we definitely did Matty Groves,"
36:58;37:00;"like a Fairport Convention-style--"
37:00;37:01;"Was there a drummer?"
37:01;37:03;"Maybe, like, a dude on a snare drum"
37:03;37:04;"'cause we were just, like, rehearsing"
37:04;37:06;"in, like, dorm rooms and stuff."
37:06;37:09;"I remember you playing me a Steelye Span song"
37:09;37:11;"Oh, yeah, I was so into Steelye Span."
37:11;37:14;"Maybe in that 2005 minivan tour."
37:14;37:16;"Yeah, 'cause I've been obsessed with Steelye Span"
37:16;37:18;"since my sophomore year of high school,"
37:18;37:21;"where my mom randomly had a Steelye Span CD"
37:21;37:22;"somebody gave her as a gift."
37:22;37:23;"Yeah."
37:23;37:24;"For people who don't know,"
37:24;37:25;"they're kind of like contemporaries"
37:25;37:27;"of Fairport Convention, like, British folk rock."

46:11;46:12;"And again, that doesn't mean, like,"
46:12;46:14;"I expect that, like, people who are growing up too"
46:14;46:16;"are gonna want to, you know,"
46:16;46:18;"dance around to A-Punk every single day."
46:18;46:19;"But, like, if I'm honest,"
46:19;46:21;"I think I've written, like, richer songs"
46:21;46:22;"as I've gotten older."
46:22;46:25;"I think my song writing and lyrics have gotten better."
46:25;46:28;"I think our production has gotten more tasteful"
46:28;46:29;"over the years."
46:29;46:32;"I think there's a lot of ways in which we've moved forward."
46:32;46:34;"But at the end of the day, just, like,"
46:34;46:38;"that sheer, like, youthful, fresh stupidity"
46:38;46:40;"of just, like, picking up a guitar and going..."
46:40;46:41;"[imitates guitar]"
46:41;46:45;"Like, there's a reason why that song still, like, pops up"
46:45;46:47;"and, like, goofy memes and, like,"
46:47;46:49;"a bunch of, like, knuckleheads are, like,"
46:49;46:51;"dancing to it on TikTok, like, doing a silly dance."
46:51;46:53;"So some people might assume that I might think,"
46:53;46:55;"""Oh, yeah, that's, like, one of our biggest songs,"
46:55;46:57;"but that's just, like, this annoying young song."""
46:57;46:59;"And my real, you know, my real [bleep]"
46:59;47:00;"as a songwriter is, like, a song like"
47:00;47:02;"""Unbearably White"" or ""Hannah Hunt."""
47:02;47:04;"You know, those are, like, pretty..."
47:04;47:06;"To me, like, the A-Punk guitar riff,"
47:06;47:09;"that's more like a once-a-decade idea that you get."
47:09;47:10;"I know, it sounds so stupid."
47:10;47:13;"Because it's so simple, but there's actually, to me,"
47:13;47:16;"more precedent for a lot of the more beautiful"
47:16;47:17;"""Vampire Weekend"" songs."
47:17;47:20;"And in a funny way, like, a song like ""A-Punk"""
47:20;47:23;"or ""Oxford Comma,"" to me, those are truly, like,"
47:23;47:25;"the slightly out-of-nowhere songs."
47:25;47:27;"And I know people might hear it differently,"
47:27;47:28;"and they'd be like, ""Well, 'A-Punk' sounds like this,"
47:28;47:29;"or 'Oxford Comma' sounds like that."""
47:29;47:32;"But I just know that that's, like, I consider those"
47:32;47:34;"as, like, weird lightning-bolt ideas."
47:34;47:36;"So anyway, I look back on the first album,"
47:36;47:38;"and to me, especially when I still play those songs"
47:38;47:41;"live or something, there always will be, like,"
47:41;47:43;"a freshness about it."
47:43;47:45;"So there is some type of, like, energy in it,"
47:45;47:47;"and I still look for that energy."
47:47;47:49;"I'm always looking for ideas that I find fresh"
47:49;47:51;"or exciting on every album."
47:51;47:54;"And I'm not even saying the first album's my favorite,"
47:54;47:56;"but again, with a question that has something to do"
47:56;47:58;"with energy, there's something about that,"
47:58;48:01;"that youthful, first, like, breakthrough about it"
48:01;48:04;"that is a little hard to ever top."
48:04;48:07;"Joanna drove slowly into the city"

50:27;50:29;"Their crew"
50:29;50:32;"So if there's any other way"
50:32;50:35;"To spell the word it's fine with me"
50:35;50:37;"With me"
50:37;50:41;"Why would you speak to me that way?"

50:49;50:54;"All your diction dripping with disdain"
50:54;50:58;"Through the pain I always tell the truth"

53:17;53:20;"What y'all's favorite cereals?"
53:20;53:22;"Sour Patch Kids cereal, of course."
53:22;53:24;"Grape Nuts."
53:24;53:25;"Really?"
53:25;53:26;"Yeah."
53:26;53:28;"No, like a wholesome cereal."
53:28;53:29;"I like Grape Nuts."
53:29;53:31;"Grape Nuts? Do you mix it? Do you put anything else in them?"
53:31;53:33;"I don't eat it, but I mean..."
53:33;53:34;"As a concept?"
53:34;53:35;"Yeah, as a concept."
53:35;53:37;"They're actually... what is it?"
53:37;53:39;"The cereal's played out, dog."
53:39;53:41;"The cereal's played out."
53:41;53:44;"I'll do like a Greek yogurt with some granola in the morning."
53:44;53:45;"That's pretty classic."
53:45;53:48;"But you don't do the dry cereal with the milk in it and then the..."
53:48;53:49;"No."
53:49;53:50;"Played out, dog."
53:50;53:51;"Wow."
53:51;53:53;"Didn't millennials kill cereal?"
53:53;53:54;"Probably."
53:54;53:55;"Google that."
53:55;53:56;"That's like an article, right?"
53:56;53:57;"Yeah, that sounds right."
53:57;53:59;"The unbearable whiteness of cereal."
53:59;54:01;"That's a think piece I wrote."
54:01;54:06;"The baffling reason many millennials don't eat cereal, Washington Post."
54:06;54:08;"What are the odds there's truly a..."
54:08;54:10;"Democracy dies in darkness."
54:10;54:13;"Wait, that's their tag, right?"
54:13;54:14;"Yeah."
54:14;54:15;"Wow."
54:15;54:16;"Jeff Bezos owned Washington Post."
54:16;54:18;"The baffling reason millennials..."
54:18;54:20;"Wait, what's the odds that there truly is a baffling reason"
54:20;54:23;"or it's just more like a mix of various trends?"
54:23;54:24;"Okay, tell us."
54:24;54:25;"Ooh."
54:25;54:27;"Well, just to back it up,"
54:27;54:31;"sales have tumbled by 30% over the last 15 years of breakfast cereal."
54:31;54:32;"Ouch."
54:32;54:34;"Rough stuff, folks."
54:34;54:36;"That's going to leave a mark."
54:36;54:38;"Folks, the cereal industry,"
54:38;54:43;"the American cereal industry has taken a hit like you wouldn't believe."
54:43;54:49;"A large contingent of millennials are uninterested in breakfast cereal"
54:49;54:55;"because eating it means using a bowl and bowls don't clean themselves."
54:55;54:58;"Oh, there's a touch of condescension in that phrase."
54:58;55:01;"That's the easiest thing to clean is rinse it."
55:01;55:02;"It's true."
55:02;55:04;"Now, actually, I feel like I read this article before"
55:04;55:06;"and this is like classic clickbait."
55:06;55:10;"Like, first of all, I thought millennials love eating [bleep] out of bowls."
55:10;55:12;"Everywhere you look in millennial neighborhoods,"
55:12;55:13;"everything's in a goddamn bowl."
55:13;55:14;"Right."
55:14;55:15;"Acai bowls, grain bowls."
55:15;55:16;"Burrito bowl."
55:16;55:18;"Wait, but those are like disposable bowls."
55:18;55:19;"Sometimes."
55:19;55:20;"Not always."
55:20;55:21;"But what's their point?"
55:21;55:23;"That you could buy disposable bowls."
55:23;55:26;"You could eat the cereal dryer right out of the box, folks."
55:26;55:29;"[laughter]"
55:29;55:31;"Just like back in the day."
55:31;55:36;"General Mills hires Jake for just like some last-ditch scared straight type ads."
55:36;55:39;"There's like, I'm not even here to represent a specific cereal."
55:39;55:41;"I'm here to represent the industry."
55:41;55:43;"Yeah, paid for by General Mills."
55:43;55:48;"I'm hearing a lot of you millennials say that you don't want to eat cereal"
55:48;55:50;"because the bowls don't wash themselves."
55:50;55:51;"Well, guess what?"
55:51;55:53;"You can eat it right out of the box, folks."
55:53;55:54;"You don't need milk."
55:54;55:56;"You don't need almond milk."
55:56;55:58;"I'm tired of these excuses."
55:58;56:01;"You know, I went on a vacation recently outside of L.A.,"
56:01;56:05;"and one of the people we were with, she said there was Grape-Nuts there"
56:05;56:09;"and like stocked up on them because you can't really get them in Los Angeles."
56:09;56:10;"What?"
56:10;56:11;"It's hard to find."
56:11;56:13;"They're not carried regularly."
56:13;56:14;"Grape-Nuts Desert?"
56:14;56:15;"Yeah, Grape-Nuts Desert."
56:15;56:17;"Is that an East Coast cereal?"
56:17;56:19;"We always had Grape-Nuts in the house growing up."
56:19;56:22;"Yeah, classic kind of mildly hippie cereal."
56:22;56:24;"Wait, also I love it."
56:24;56:26;"It's like eating like rocks."
56:26;56:28;"Yeah, it's got a cool texture."
56:28;56:30;"Wait, wait, Seinfeld, was that literally the whole article?"
56:30;56:34;"Was that like we're getting Rickrolled by the Washington Post?"
56:34;56:35;"Here's a new one."
56:35;56:37;"You ever think about this?"
56:37;56:39;"Why don't millennials eat as much cereal?"
56:39;56:43;"Yeah, because those bowls won't wash themselves."
56:43;56:45;"Am I right?"
56:45;56:46;"Am I right?"
56:46;56:47;"Oh, you don't like that one?"
56:47;56:49;"Probably a lot of millennials in the crowd tonight, you know what I'm saying?"
56:49;56:51;"They don't like to be criticized."
56:51;56:53;"Well, they go deep, and what they say is that--"
56:53;56:54;"They go deep."
56:54;57:00;"--chores are down, so kids today aren't doing as many chores as Generation X."
57:00;57:02;"But that's a chicken or the egg thing."
57:02;57:04;"That's because they're getting less cereal, so there's less bowls to clean."
57:04;57:05;"That's right."
57:05;57:07;"It's a self-perpetuating cycle."
57:07;57:10;"Are they making a convincing case that it's grasping at straws?"
57:10;57:11;"Also, what about the fact that just--"
57:11;57:16;"I think one of the biggest factors is just that people eat less carbs now."
57:16;57:19;"Carbs have been dragged through the mud for 20 years."
57:19;57:24;"Big protein has been just [bleep] on carbs for decades."
57:24;57:30;"And you don't think that's going to have an impact on whether or not people want to start the day with a big-ass bowl of carbs?"
57:30;57:31;"Get out of here."
57:31;57:34;"Give it 10 years, it's going to be carbs prevent cancer."
57:34;57:36;"We were wrong."
57:36;57:37;"Back in the teens."
57:37;57:41;"Sugary cereal and milk adds 10 years to your life."
57:41;57:43;"Also, I feel like--you know what I think it is?"
57:43;57:46;"A glass of red wine and some sugary cereal?"
57:46;57:49;"I think carbs got played out, and so did milk."
57:49;57:53;"I don't think people talked that much about being lactose intolerant in the '60s."
57:53;57:55;"People would just have stomachaches and [bleep]"
57:55;57:56;"Then it became like, ""Yeah, I'm lactose intolerant."""
57:56;57:58;"And you're like, ""Really? Maybe I am too."""
57:58;58:01;"And then people just being like, ""Yeah, what are you just drinking? Milk? Milk? Ugh."""
58:01;58:04;"And then milk tried too hard in the '90s to be cool."
58:04;58:06;"And then people got milk and was like, ""Yo, chill."""
58:06;58:09;"""I'm gluten-free. I'm lactose intolerant."""
58:09;58:13;"""You think I don't want to eat a bowl of cereal every morning? It kills me."""
58:13;58:15;"""I have to have this acai bowl."""
58:15;58:18;"""I'm just on the Grape Nuts Wikipedia page."""
58:18;58:19;"""Thank you."""
58:19;58:26;"And Grape Nuts was founded by John Harvey Kellogg."
58:26;58:27;"And they have this ad--"
58:27;58:28;"The legend."
58:28;58:33;"They've got this ad from 1900, the year 1900, a newspaper ad for Grape Nuts."
58:33;58:34;"And here's what it says."
58:34;58:38;"""Fruit of some kind should be used at the breakfast during hot weather."""
58:38;58:45;"""Follow this with a dish of four heaping teaspoonfuls of Grape Nuts, cold and treated with rich cold cream."""
58:45;58:48;"""This dish gives the staying qualities necessary."""
58:48;58:52;"I feel like a while ago I saw a really funny, old-timey Grape Nuts ad."
58:52;58:54;"Wait, when did Grape Nuts launch? What year?"
58:54;58:56;"1897."
58:56;58:57;"Wow."
58:57;58:58;"122 years."
58:58;58:59;"Respect."
58:59;59:00;"That'd be a cool shirt."
59:00;59:03;"122 years of Grape Nuts."

01:01:44;01:01:45;"- That was a great bar."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"- Called the smog cutter."
01:01:46;01:01:47;"- What did it become?"
01:01:47;01:01:48;"- I don't know what it is."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"- Freaking Starbucks?"
01:01:49;01:01:50;"- Something."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"Panera."
01:01:51;01:01:52;"- Goddamn."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"- At my birthday at the smog cutter."
01:01:54;01:01:55;"- That's right, Nick."
01:01:55;01:01:58;"- Ezra did Blink 182 on karaoke."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"- Oh yeah, yeah."
01:01:59;01:02:02;"♪ Na na na na na na na na ♪"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"I've done that one a few times."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"- I don't have any go-to's."
01:02:08;01:02:12;"I was pretty into Doctor My Eyes by Jackson Browne."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"(laughing)"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"I was pretty into--"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"- I feel like you did some country songs or something."
01:02:17;01:02:18;"- Daniel by Elton John."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"- Oh, that's a good one."
01:02:19;01:02:21;"- Um."
01:02:21;01:02:24;"- There was a while where my go-to became Sweet Caroline."
01:02:24;01:02:25;"- Hm."
01:02:25;01:02:27;"- I also think if you're kind of like a music nerd,"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"a lot of people have this experience"
01:02:29;01:02:32;"where you go to karaoke in your high school years"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"or college or something,"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"and you go and you're looking through the book,"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"and you're like, ""Wow, oh, they got that song?"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"""Cool, let me choose that one."""
01:02:40;01:02:42;"And then you start singing it 'cause you like the song."
01:02:42;01:02:43;"- Yeah."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"- And then you look around."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"- Dead."
01:02:45;01:02:46;"- You're a goddamn ass(beep)."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"- Yeah."
01:02:47;01:02:50;"- Hey, man, this isn't the cake shop."
01:02:50;01:02:51;"(laughing)"
01:02:51;01:02:52;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:02:52;01:02:54;"Like, we're trying to have a good time here."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"We're trying to have a good communal experience,"
01:02:55;01:02:56;"and you're singing some,"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"or some people don't know or vaguely know"
01:02:58;01:02:59;"or just it's hard to sing,"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"and then you start to realize, okay,"
01:03:01;01:03:04;"a good karaoke song is just a feel-good thing."
01:03:04;01:03:05;"So at some point, I was like,"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"""My karaoke song is Sweet Caroline."""
01:03:07;01:03:09;"But everybody gets to join in."
01:03:09;01:03:10;"(singing)"
01:03:10;01:03:11;"And then I felt like at some point,"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"I was like, ""Is this too basic?"""
01:03:13;01:03:14;"- Might be a little basic."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"- I know, I wouldn't do that at the Smog Cutter,"
01:03:16;01:03:17;"but then I started--"
01:03:17;01:03:18;"- You know what's a good one?"
01:03:18;01:03:19;"- I don't know, I just didn't know anymore."
01:03:19;01:03:21;"- Take Me Home, Country Roads."
01:03:21;01:03:22;"- Oh, great song."
01:03:22;01:03:23;"- That's a good one."

01:05:27;01:05:28;"- Damn."
01:05:28;01:05:29;"Yeah, actually, that recent trip,"
01:05:29;01:05:31;"when we were in Japan at some point,"
01:05:31;01:05:32;"we were, like, rolling out, we were like,"
01:05:32;01:05:33;"""Oh, we didn't do any karaoke."""
01:05:33;01:05:35;"You know, it's a classic thing to do in Tokyo,"
01:05:35;01:05:36;"and then I thought about it, I was like,"
01:05:36;01:05:39;"""Eh, eh, it's okay, it's all right."""
01:05:39;01:05:41;"I think I used to go to some karaoke bars,"
01:05:41;01:05:44;"like, remember there's that bar Winnie's in New York?"
01:05:44;01:05:45;"- No. - That was, like,"
01:05:45;01:05:48;"a real poppin' bar in Chinatown, right?"
01:05:48;01:05:49;"And that was one of those bars"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"where it's, like, a crowded bar and there's, like, a stage,"
01:05:51;01:05:52;"so if you wanna sing, you're gonna be singing"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"all sorts of--in front of strangers,"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"and they used to be like, ""Ugh, that's not a good vibe."""
01:05:56;01:05:58;"And then you start to go to more, like,"
01:05:58;01:06:01;"Japanese-style karaoke rooms. - Sure."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"- And you're there with your friends,"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"and then I got--and then that got played out for me, too,"
01:06:04;01:06:05;"where I was like, ""You know what?"
01:06:05;01:06:08;"""I like the weirdness of just being in an open bar."""
01:06:08;01:06:10;"- Which is why I love the small cutter."
01:06:10;01:06:11;"- Yeah, that was a good vibe."
01:06:11;01:06:14;"- Yeah, the--going to the room with your friends is weird."
01:06:14;01:06:15;"'Cause there's, like, five of you."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"- 'Cause you're just sitting in this, like,"
01:06:16;01:06:18;"small room, and it's so noisy-- it's, like, loud,"
01:06:18;01:06:21;"and at least, like, in the--at a place like the small cutter,"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"you can either be in the mix with the karaoke,"
01:06:23;01:06:25;"go have a drink, go step outside, you know?"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"- Yeah. - I need freedom of movement."
01:06:27;01:06:30;"- Seinfeld, has anyone ever tried to, like,"
01:06:30;01:06:33;"punk you, Ezra, by, like, putting on Vampire Weekend"
01:06:33;01:06:36;"at karaoke, and everybody's like, ""Oh."""
01:06:36;01:06:38;"- People have made the joke before,"
01:06:38;01:06:39;"where they're like, ""Oh, what if I just went"

01:06:41;01:06:44;"And I just be like, ""Oh, that would make me feel weird."""
01:06:44;01:06:46;"But I feel like maybe once when the whole band"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"was in Japan or something, we did karaoke,"
01:06:48;01:06:49;"we looked in the book, and there was like,"

01:06:52;01:06:54;"Oh, there was something funny once."

01:06:57;01:06:59;"I don't know if--where they were,"

01:07:05;01:07:06;"And I'm pretty sure it was, like--"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"it was two kind of big songs, like,"
01:07:08;01:07:09;"A-Punk and Oxford Comma or something,"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"and then the third one was Jonathan Lowe."

01:07:14;01:07:15;"- That is so legit."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"Has anyone ever done that?"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"- See, that's an example of a bad choice."
01:07:19;01:07:21;"I almost feel bad. Now I'm picturing, like,"
01:07:21;01:07:23;"like a VW head just out with their friends,"
01:07:23;01:07:26;"like, ""Yo, Jonathan Lowe, that's a great VW deep cut."""
01:07:26;01:07:27;"And they're just, like, getting on it,"
01:07:27;01:07:29;"and they're just like-- - What is this?"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"- Yeah, at least it's, like, a fast song."
01:07:31;01:07:32;"- That's funny."
01:07:32;01:07:34;"- Not, like, doing, like, a five-minute ballad"
01:07:34;01:07:35;"nobody knows. - Right."

01:07:50;01:07:52;"- Zero? 1,000 at-bats?"
01:07:52;01:07:53;"- There's no way."
01:07:53;01:07:56;"Roger Clemens in, like, 86, 87."
01:07:56;01:07:58;"- Whatever peak Clemens was. - Even just--"
01:07:58;01:08:01;"- Or even Clemens, like, when he's all steroided out"
01:08:01;01:08:03;"in, like, 2003 or-- - You don't think"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"he hit a single-- - No, no, no."
01:08:05;01:08:09;"I would maybe-- I would maybe make contact with it."
01:08:09;01:08:11;"I wouldn't get a base hit."
01:08:11;01:08:12;"Like, if there were fielders,"
01:08:12;01:08:15;"and I had to, like, hit a ground ball through a hole"
01:08:15;01:08:18;"or, like, get a line drive out of the infield,"
01:08:18;01:08:19;"there's no chance."
01:08:19;01:08:21;"- But you'd make contact. - Maybe."
01:08:21;01:08:24;"Like, he's throwing, like, 95 miles an hour."
01:08:24;01:08:25;"Honestly, I'd be scared of the ball."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"- All right."

01:26:44;01:26:46;"No, just in life."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"Privately."
01:26:48;01:26:50;"[laughs]"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"This was actually written as a response to"
01:26:52;01:26:54;"Are You Going to San Francisco?"
01:26:54;01:26:56;"Hmm."
01:26:56;01:27:03;"♪ I'm going back to Massachusetts ♪"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"As a response to it?"
01:27:05;01:27:08;"A bunch of Australian guys were like,"
01:27:08;01:27:11;"""Too much love for San Francisco. People forget about Massachusetts."""
01:27:11;01:27:22;"♪ And the lights all went down in Massachusetts ♪"
01:27:22;01:27:31;"♪ The day I left her standing on her own ♪"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"This is kind of like a country song."
01:27:33;01:27:35;"The writing. Nice song."
01:27:35;01:27:43;"♪ To get your ride to San Francisco ♪"
01:27:43;01:27:51;"♪ Gotta do the things I wanna do ♪"
01:27:51;01:28:00;"♪ And the lights all went down in Massachusetts ♪"
01:28:00;01:28:08;"♪ They brought me back to see my way with you ♪"
01:28:08;01:28:10;"You know what we could talk about for a second,"
01:28:10;01:28:13;"just to pause from the rapid-fire questions?"
01:28:13;01:28:16;"I finally, for the first-- I thought I'd seen it,"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"but then as I watched it, I was like,"
01:28:17;01:28:18;"""I've never seen this whole movie."""
01:28:18;01:28:21;"On the flight recently, I finally just watched"
01:28:21;01:28:22;"Saturday Night Fever."
01:28:22;01:28:23;"Oh, wow."
01:28:23;01:28:24;"Front to back."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"Have you ever watched the whole movie?"
01:28:25;01:28:26;"I have, years ago."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"Very interesting film."
01:28:27;01:28:28;"Yeah."
01:28:28;01:28:32;"'Cause, I mean, I always knew that the soundtrack was, like, sick,"
01:28:32;01:28:35;"but I didn't fully understand what it was about."
01:28:35;01:28:38;"I think it was a big influence on Boogie Nights."
01:28:38;01:28:39;"Oh, yeah, I'm sure."
01:28:39;01:28:40;"And it's a very interesting story."
01:28:40;01:28:43;"Like, apparently it was based off this New York Magazine article"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"that an English guy wrote that he later admitted"
01:28:45;01:28:46;"he's, like, fully made up."
01:28:46;01:28:47;"Whoa."
01:28:47;01:28:49;"He, like, went to Brooklyn to try to, like,"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"just write about the scene."
01:28:50;01:28:51;"Uh-huh."
01:28:51;01:28:52;"And then he was kind of there, and he's like,"
01:28:52;01:28:54;"""I don't know,"" and he just started making up things"
01:28:54;01:28:57;"that he remembered from, like, growing up in England."
01:28:57;01:29:01;"But the interesting thing to me is the way that this film"
01:29:01;01:29:04;"got kind of presented or, like, filtered through the culture"
01:29:04;01:29:07;"was almost like it was the epitome of--"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"and we've talked at length about how there used to be"
01:29:09;01:29:11;"this kind of rock versus disco thing."
01:29:11;01:29:12;"Sure."
01:29:12;01:29:14;"And the way that this film was kind of presented"
01:29:14;01:29:17;"was always Travolta in the white suit,"
01:29:17;01:29:21;"and, oh, man, this is this glitzy, not-rock thing."
01:29:21;01:29:26;"It represents a kind of almost, like, sterile pop, you know."
01:29:26;01:29:27;"And then when I actually saw the movie, I was like--"
01:29:27;01:29:28;"It's gritty."
01:29:28;01:29:31;"This is a gritty movie about working-class knuckleheads."
01:29:31;01:29:32;"Yep."
01:29:32;01:29:34;"And also, in some ways, it's so not slick"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"that the whole point of the movie is that it's actually"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"about a big fish in a small town,"
01:29:38;01:29:42;"almost like local loser dude who kind of gets gassed up"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"by his friends that he's this incredible dancer"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"and then has a moment where he looks around and says,"
01:29:46;01:29:49;"""You guys are a bunch of weird, provincial, racist dudes,"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"and I don't even know what this means."""
01:29:51;01:29:53;"And I watched it, I was like, ""Oh."""
01:29:53;01:29:55;"I had no idea that that was the vibe of this movie."
01:29:55;01:29:58;"Like, real small-town Brooklyn vibe,"
01:29:58;01:30:01;"where even Manhattan looms as this kind of distant,"
01:30:01;01:30:05;"almost scary thing where he's talking to the love interest,"
01:30:05;01:30:07;"kind of like, ""Oh, yeah, you going to Manhattan?"""
01:30:07;01:30:09;"And actually, there's a part where she's--"
01:30:09;01:30:11;"basically, Travolta's the local knucklehead."
01:30:11;01:30:14;"He works at the paint shop, not particularly ambitious,"
01:30:14;01:30:18;"and then the love interest is also a Brooklyn girl,"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"but she's a little more cultured,"
01:30:20;01:30:22;"and she likes to flaunt her culture"
01:30:22;01:30:25;"because she has a job in working for a PR firm in Manhattan."
01:30:25;01:30:28;"And there's, like, a great scene where they kind of go on a date"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"where they're just, like, talking,"
01:30:30;01:30:33;"and she's kind of, like, being very pretentious,"
01:30:33;01:30:37;"and she clearly is enjoying holding this over John Travolta."
01:30:37;01:30:40;"So at some point, she's talking about all the people"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"she's had lunch with over the course of her job,"
01:30:42;01:30:45;"and we kind of know she probably is low man on the totem pole,"
01:30:45;01:30:48;"but here back in Brooklyn, she can flaunt her Manhattan status."
01:30:48;01:30:50;"At some point, she was like, ""Yeah, you know,"
01:30:50;01:30:53;"""recently I was working with Eric Clapton and Cat Stevens,"
01:30:53;01:30:55;"""and you know them?"" And he was like, ""Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."""
01:30:55;01:30:57;"She's like, ""Really? You know who those guys are?"""
01:30:57;01:30:59;"And he goes, ""Well, you know, I've heard of them."
01:30:59;01:31:01;"""I heard they're good. You don't know who they are."""
01:31:01;01:31:04;"And he's like, ""Yeah, yeah, I don't actually know who they are."""
01:31:04;01:31:06;"And she's like, ""Well, why'd you say that then?"""
01:31:06;01:31:08;"- Wow. - And there's this whole thing"
01:31:08;01:31:10;"where the joke is that John Travolta--"
01:31:10;01:31:13;"- Doesn't know who Eric Clapton is. - Or Cat Stevens."
01:31:13;01:31:16;"He's just a local knucklehead who likes to dance."
01:31:16;01:31:18;"- Not into rock and roll. - Not into-- yeah."
01:31:18;01:31:20;"But then the cool thing is that--"
01:31:20;01:31:23;"Have you heard of Cream? Have you heard of Derek and the Dominoes?"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"You heard of the Jerry Garcia Band?"
01:31:25;01:31:28;"What is that, like some hippie stuff?"
01:31:28;01:31:30;"I don't know. I can't dance to it."
01:31:30;01:31:33;"Anyway, I really felt a little bit like,"
01:31:33;01:31:37;"wow, this whole film had been misrepresented in the culture."
01:31:37;01:31:40;"I know anybody who actually lived at that time and saw the movies"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"is hyper-aware of this, but as somebody--"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"- No, it's like a real movie. - Yeah."
01:31:44;01:31:47;"( music playing )"
01:31:59;01:32:08;"( music playing )"
01:32:08;01:32:18;"( music playing )"
01:32:18;01:32:21;"( music playing )"
01:32:21;01:32:35;"Okay, that's enough talk about Saturday Night Fever."
01:32:35;01:32:37;"Back to the questions."
01:32:37;01:32:39;"Somebody's asked--"
01:32:39;01:32:43;"basically someone's best friend has named their child Ezra"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"and they're asking for the best Ezra nicknames."
01:32:45;01:32:48;"Is there more than one? Isn't it just like Ez?"
01:32:48;01:32:52;"Well, when I was little, my nickname in the family was Ezzy."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"E-Z-Z-I."
01:32:54;01:32:59;"So, for instance, I had some wood blocks with the letters E-Z-Z-I."
01:32:59;01:33:03;"So, Ezzy, Ezzy boy, things like that."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"And then, of course, people always called me Ez."
01:33:05;01:33:08;"And I can think of random nicknames I got over the years, like--"
01:33:08;01:33:11;"I remember I went to some kind of summer camp thing once"
01:33:11;01:33:14;"where there was this kid that I met who always called me RZA."
01:33:14;01:33:16;"( laughs )"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"So I got, like, the hip-hop nicknames RZA,"
01:33:18;01:33:20;"somebody called me Rahim."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"But, yeah, Ez is the classic."
01:33:22;01:33:25;"But Ezzy is cute, I think, for a little kid."
01:33:25;01:33:26;"Hey, Ezzy."
01:33:26;01:33:28;"I think that just comes naturally, right?"
01:33:28;01:33:30;"- Oh, yeah. - All right, let's get a couple more, Seinfeld."
01:33:30;01:33:32;"All right."
01:33:32;01:33:36;"What are your feelings on the iconic Canadian prog rock band Rush?"
01:33:36;01:33:38;"Oh, there you go."
01:33:38;01:33:40;"They were some good songs."
01:33:40;01:33:42;"Zeppelin without any blues?"
01:33:42;01:33:45;"- That's how you describe Rush? - I guess. I don't know."
01:33:45;01:33:47;"- But they're, like, prog-ier? - Yeah."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"I don't know that many songs I'm gonna know."

01:35:18;01:35:23;"Ezra, can you describe your fast food preferences/habits while on tour?"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"Well, on tour, I try to keep it healthy,"
01:35:25;01:35:28;"so I don't actually eat that much fast food on tour."
01:35:28;01:35:32;"That would be, like, a treat to maybe hit a Taco Bell or a McDonald's or something."
01:35:32;01:35:36;"On tour, I try to, you know, eat, like, boring food,"
01:35:36;01:35:41;"like steamed vegetables and chicken breast, a salad, things like that."
01:35:41;01:35:43;"Dried mango for a sweet treat."
01:35:43;01:35:44;"All right."
01:35:44;01:35:46;"Phil Collins is going on tour right now,"
01:35:46;01:35:51;"and the title of the tour is, quote, ""Phil Collins' Still Not Dead Yet Tour."""
01:35:51;01:35:54;"In 40 years' time, when VW and Richard Pictures tours,"
01:35:54;01:35:57;"what will your respective tours be called?"
01:35:57;01:35:58;"Hmm."
01:35:58;01:36:01;"Well, our current tour is called the Promise Land Tour."
01:36:01;01:36:03;"Because you're playing Promise Land every set?"
01:36:03;01:36:04;"We are."
01:36:04;01:36:08;"That's our new big-- well, that's one of many set additions."
01:36:08;01:36:10;"That's funny, because I was thinking about that,"
01:36:10;01:36:13;"because when we had to, like, you know, make some ads and stuff,"
01:36:13;01:36:16;"like, ""Well, what are you calling the tour this year?"""
01:36:16;01:36:18;"And I was like, ""I think if we call it anything other than"
01:36:18;01:36:20;"the Father of the Bride Tour, it's confusing."""
01:36:20;01:36:21;"Sure."
01:36:21;01:36:23;"Like, we just put out Father of the Bride, and we're just like,"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"""Ride the Lightning Tour?"""
01:36:25;01:36:27;"Like, what would you call it?"
01:36:27;01:36:29;"I guess you could call it something--"
01:36:29;01:36:31;"Like, you could reference one, and you could call it"
01:36:31;01:36:32;"the Harmony Hall Tour."
01:36:32;01:36:34;"That seems weird, too."
01:36:34;01:36:38;"Or like, Summer 2019, the 2021 Tour."
01:36:38;01:36:39;"Have you guys had--"
01:36:39;01:36:40;"[laughter]"
01:36:40;01:36:41;"That would be really confusing."
01:36:41;01:36:43;"Have you had creative names for previous tours,"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"or has it always been named after the album?"
01:36:45;01:36:46;"I don't think so."
01:36:46;01:36:48;"I think it makes sense to come up with a creative name for a tour"
01:36:48;01:36:50;"if it's, like, a special bill."
01:36:50;01:36:52;"Like, if we ever do a proper tour of Vampire Week"
01:36:52;01:36:55;"and Richard Pictures kind of like on some random summer,"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"we could call that just like Rippin' and Dippin',"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"the Rippin' Dip Tour."
01:36:59;01:37:00;"That'd be tight, dude."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"Pictures of vampires."
01:37:02;01:37:04;"Do, like, a Ten City Run."
01:37:04;01:37:05;"Ten City Run?"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"Vampire, Richard."
01:37:07;01:37:08;"It could be fun."
01:37:08;01:37:09;"That could be great."
01:37:09;01:37:11;"So something like that maybe deserves a special name,"
01:37:11;01:37:12;"or just like--"
01:37:12;01:37:14;"I feel like there are a lot of tours where, like,"
01:37:14;01:37:16;"people refer to themselves as, like, gods."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"Gods?"
01:37:17;01:37:18;"Or like lords."
01:37:18;01:37:20;"Lords of Summer."
01:37:20;01:37:21;"Jesus."
01:37:21;01:37:22;"[laughter]"
01:37:22;01:37:23;"Gods of the stage."
01:37:23;01:37:26;"Like, I mean, where it's like a special bill."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"My favorite lyric--"
01:37:27;01:37:28;"James Taylor and Phil Collins."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"My favorite lyric in Promised Land is,"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"""Workin' on a T-bone steak a la Carde,"
01:37:32;01:37:34;"""flyin' to the Golden State."""
01:37:34;01:37:35;"Carde?"
01:37:35;01:37:36;"He says Carde, yeah."
01:37:36;01:37:37;"Oh, okay."
01:37:37;01:37:38;"Like a la carte."
01:37:38;01:37:39;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:37:39;01:37:40;"Like Cardi B."
01:37:40;01:37:41;"Exactly."
01:37:41;01:37:43;"Chuck Berry is on an airplane,"
01:37:43;01:37:46;"eating a T-bone steak on the airplane."
01:37:46;01:37:48;"He's flyin' into L.A."
01:37:48;01:37:51;"All that a la carte really means is just by itself."
01:37:51;01:37:52;"Yeah, so he's just eating a--"
01:37:52;01:37:55;"there's no side of broccoli and mashed potatoes."
01:37:55;01:37:58;"It's just T-bone steak on, like, a plate."
01:37:58;01:38:00;"And Mr. Berry, are you sure you don't want"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"any vegetables or potatoes with that?"
01:38:02;01:38:03;"No thanks."
01:38:03;01:38:05;"A la carte, please."
01:38:05;01:38:07;"I know I referenced it on a previous episode,"
01:38:07;01:38:10;"but we're going to Norfolk, Virginia, for the first time."
01:38:10;01:38:12;"And I was saying how probably people play that song"
01:38:12;01:38:13;"all the time there."
01:38:13;01:38:14;"Sure."
01:38:14;01:38:15;"And it wouldn't even make that much sense."
01:38:15;01:38:16;"That's actually a song you should play"
01:38:16;01:38:17;"when you're in California."
01:38:17;01:38:19;"Yeah, it's about chasing your dreams."
01:38:19;01:38:21;"That's actually a disrespectful song to play"
01:38:21;01:38:24;"in Norfolk, Virginia, because the whole premise"
01:38:24;01:38:26;"of the song implies that Norfolk, Virginia"
01:38:26;01:38:28;"is decidedly not the promised land."
01:38:28;01:38:29;"Exactly."
01:38:29;01:38:31;"Maybe if I really thoughtfully changed the lyrics,"
01:38:31;01:38:34;"or I'm like, ""Norfolk, I know you probably know"
01:38:34;01:38:37;"that Chuck Berry song, 'Promised Land,'"
01:38:37;01:38:40;"also popularized by Grateful Dead and Richard Pictures,"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"but why do people always have to say that"
01:38:42;01:38:44;"Norfolk, Virginia is not the promised land?"""
01:38:44;01:38:45;"And then I'd fully flip the lyrics."
01:38:45;01:38:46;"You do reverse."

01:38:54;01:38:55;"Okay."
01:38:55;01:38:57;"The Greyhound breaks down in Albuquerque."
01:38:57;01:38:58;"Still works."
01:38:58;01:39:00;"You catch that train over to Houston."
01:39:00;01:39:01;"Yep."

01:41:00;01:41:02;"have you seen this Mike Love"
01:41:02;01:41:05;"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame acceptance speech?"
01:41:05;01:41:06;"And what are your thoughts?"
01:41:06;01:41:09;"- We've been emailed and people have referenced"
01:41:09;01:41:12;"this, I guess, infamous Mike Love"
01:41:12;01:41:14;"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech."
01:41:14;01:41:16;"I don't know exactly what he said,"
01:41:16;01:41:18;"but Mike Love, I guess, has always been known"
01:41:18;01:41:20;"as one of the loose cannons of the Beach Boys."
01:41:20;01:41:23;"So let's check out what Mike Love had to say"
01:41:23;01:41:24;"when the Beach Boys were inducted"
01:41:24;01:41:26;"into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
01:41:29;01:41:31;"So a bunch of the Beach Boys take the stage."
01:41:31;01:41:36;"Mike Love wearing his,"
01:41:36;01:41:39;"seems like he's in a fun mood."
01:41:39;01:41:42;"He's wearing one of his classic baseball caps."
01:41:42;01:41:43;"- This is the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?"
01:41:43;01:41:44;"- Yeah."
01:41:44;01:41:46;"- When did that open?"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"- Thank you, Elton, for that wonderful induction."
01:41:51;01:41:55;"27 years ago, over a summer weekend in 1961,"
01:41:55;01:41:58;"my cousin Mike Love and I got a bright idea."
01:41:58;01:41:59;"We were going to write a song."
01:41:59;01:42:01;"My parents were going away"
01:42:01;01:42:03;"and they left us some money for food."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"As soon as they split, we went to the music shop--"
01:42:05;01:42:07;"- Oh, this is Brian Wilson reading."
01:42:07;01:42:08;"- Yeah."
01:42:08;01:42:09;"- By Sunday night when my folks came home,"
01:42:09;01:42:11;"we were very hungry and we had written"
01:42:11;01:42:12;"a tune called ""Surfin'."""
01:42:12;01:42:16;"Who could have known then that 27 years"
01:42:16;01:42:19;"and 52 albums later, we would be standing"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"before you receiving this very great honor."
01:42:21;01:42:22;"- 52 albums?"
01:42:22;01:42:23;"- We're very proud and very grateful."
01:42:23;01:42:24;"- What did he say?"
01:42:24;01:42:25;"- I only wish that my younger brother, Dennis,"
01:42:25;01:42:27;"could be here at our side tonight."
01:42:27;01:42:29;"We miss him very much."
01:42:29;01:42:31;"- By the way, folks, Dennis Wilson's"
01:42:31;01:42:35;"Pacific Ocean Blue album from 1979, gold."
01:42:35;01:42:37;"- Last year-- - Check it out, highly rec."
01:42:37;01:42:38;"- When I was asked to induct Lieber and Stoller"
01:42:38;01:42:39;"into the Hall of Fame-- - Okay, so let's find"
01:42:39;01:42:40;"when Mike Love gets on the mic."
01:42:40;01:42:41;"- I came into the room--"
01:42:41;01:42:43;"(tape rewinding)"
01:42:43;01:42:45;"You heard from cousin Brian the reason why"
01:42:45;01:42:47;"we started making music"
01:42:47;01:42:50;"and the reason that keeps us going"
01:42:50;01:42:52;"and it sounds corny, but you can hear it"
01:42:52;01:42:56;"in the harmonies, those of you who are musicians."
01:42:56;01:42:58;"And the reason why people like the Beach Boys"
01:42:58;01:43:01;"is because we love harmony."
01:43:01;01:43:03;"We love music and we love harmony."
01:43:03;01:43:05;"And we love all people, too."
01:43:05;01:43:09;"When I went to school, high school,"
01:43:09;01:43:12;"my cousin Brian and I would jump over the fence,"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"ditch class, we'd go surfing."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"Now we couldn't surf very good,"
01:43:16;01:43:18;"but it was a whole lifestyle thing."
01:43:18;01:43:22;"We would listen to the music, the R&B music at the time."
01:43:22;01:43:27;"And some of our favorite records were the doo-wop"
01:43:27;01:43:30;"type of deals and there you go again with harmony."
01:43:30;01:43:34;"And I think it's wonderful to be here tonight,"
01:43:34;01:43:38;"but I also think it's sad that there are other people"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"who aren't here tonight."
01:43:40;01:43:44;"And those are the people who have passed away,"
01:43:44;01:43:45;"those are the obvious ones."
01:43:45;01:43:48;"The other not so obvious ones are people like"
01:43:48;01:43:51;"Paul McCartney, who couldn't be here tonight"
01:43:51;01:43:55;"because he's in a lawsuit with Ringo and Yoko."
01:43:55;01:43:59;"- Okay."
01:43:59;01:44:02;"- That's what he sent a telegram to some"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"high-priced attorney in this room."
01:44:04;01:44:07;"Now that's a bummer because we're talking about harmony,"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"right, in the world?"
01:44:09;01:44:10;"- It's a bummer, man."
01:44:10;01:44:11;"- If we can't get it together in America"
01:44:11;01:44:14;"and in England and harmony within our groups,"
01:44:15;01:44:17;"I mean, believe it, you can believe it,"
01:44:17;01:44:19;"the Beach Boys have their own intersticine"
01:44:19;01:44:21;"or whatever you call it, squabbles."
01:44:21;01:44:24;"But that's a bummer when Ms. Ross can't make it, you know?"
01:44:24;01:44:28;"- Why does he care about the internal politics"
01:44:28;01:44:29;"of the Beatles and the Supremes?"
01:44:29;01:44:34;"What's the point he's making?"
01:44:34;01:44:36;"- The Beach Boys continue to do,"
01:44:36;01:44:39;"we did about 180 performances last year."
01:44:39;01:44:40;"- Wow."
01:44:40;01:44:42;"- I like to see the mop tops match that."
01:44:44;01:44:45;"- What?"
01:44:45;01:44:46;"- He's also freestyling us."
01:44:46;01:44:48;"- Oh, they just cut to Julian Lettum."
01:44:48;01:44:51;"- I like to see Mick Jagger get out on this stage"
01:44:51;01:44:56;"and do I Get Around versus Jumpin' Jack Flash any day now."
01:44:56;01:44:59;"- Jumpin' Jack Flash is a good song, Mike."
01:44:59;01:45:03;"- Now a lot of people are gonna go out of this room"
01:45:03;01:45:06;"tonight thinking that Mike Love is crazy."
01:45:06;01:45:08;"Well, they've been saying that for years."
01:45:08;01:45:12;"Ain't nothing new about that."
01:45:12;01:45:13;"But what I'm talking about--"
01:45:13;01:45:14;"- Mike Love could have been president."
01:45:14;01:45:15;"- Forget this room."
01:45:15;01:45:19;"The United States is 6% of the population in the world."
01:45:19;01:45:22;"That's why I came here tonight with Muhammad Ali."
01:45:22;01:45:25;"Muhammad!"
01:45:25;01:45:26;"Salaam alaikum."
01:45:26;01:45:28;"- Okay."
01:45:28;01:45:30;"- Did he just hammered?"
01:45:30;01:45:33;"- He just threw up a black power fist."
01:45:33;01:45:35;"- Damn."
01:45:35;01:45:38;"So Muhammad Ali was his plus one?"
01:45:38;01:45:38;"- I guess."
01:45:38;01:45:39;"So wait, wait, hold on."
01:45:39;01:45:41;"So Mike Love's all over the map."
01:45:41;01:45:42;"So at first he's--"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"- He's like a scripted thing in the beginning."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"- And then he's starting to say that he's also trying"
01:45:46;01:45:48;"to think internationally and saying that Muhammad Ali"
01:45:48;01:45:52;"represents something international via his faith."
01:45:52;01:45:55;"- The US is 6% of the world's population."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"That's why I came here tonight."
01:45:57;01:45:58;"That makes no sense."

01:47:27;01:47:30;"Swedish people who didn't have enough money"
01:47:30;01:47:31;"to rent or buy a house."
01:47:31;01:47:33;"They lived in tents on the beach"

01:47:46;01:47:47;"- Yeah, nice."
01:47:47;01:47:51;"- And we're having some, we're fighting interstitial squabbles,"
01:47:51;01:47:52;"you know, messing around."
01:47:52;01:47:53;"- I love these songs."
01:47:53;01:47:55;"- What I wanna see is the whole room"
01:47:55;01:47:58;"recognize that there is one earth here."
01:47:58;01:48:02;"And I want us to do something fantastic"
01:48:02;01:48:07;"with all this talent and all this wonderful spirit and soul."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"And I'd like to see some people kick out the jams."
01:48:09;01:48:13;"And I challenge the boss to get up on stage and jam."
01:48:13;01:48:15;"- Oh, tight."
01:48:15;01:48:16;"Is Reese in there?"
01:48:16;01:48:17;"I guess so."
01:48:17;01:48:21;"Some G-Funk sense?"

01:48:25;01:48:26;"Let me see."
01:48:26;01:48:30;"I know Mick Jagger won't be here tonight."
01:48:30;01:48:32;"He's gonna have to stay in England."
01:48:32;01:48:34;"But I'd like to see us in the Coliseum"
01:48:34;01:48:36;"and him in Limited Stadium"
01:48:36;01:48:37;"'cause he's always been chicken (beep)"
01:48:37;01:48:39;"to get on stage with the Beach Boys."

01:48:42;01:48:43;"(audience laughing)"
01:48:43;01:48:45;"- Elton John."
01:48:45;01:48:46;"- Okay."
01:48:46;01:48:46;"- Okay, so."
01:48:46;01:48:49;"- So that's like the angriest call"
01:48:49;01:48:51;"for global unity I've ever heard in my life."
01:48:51;01:48:52;"(laughing)"
01:48:52;01:48:53;"It's sort of like."
01:48:53;01:48:56;"- I thought that it was gonna be more like angry,"
01:48:56;01:48:58;"like taking down all his enemies."
01:48:58;01:49:00;"It's more just all over the place."
01:49:00;01:49:02;"Maybe he's got an actual problem with Mick Jagger"
01:49:02;01:49:03;"or he thinks he's being funny."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"- He's taking the piss out of him."
01:49:05;01:49:07;"Although he's all over the place, man."
01:49:07;01:49:10;"- He's just like, we're 6% of the population,"
01:49:10;01:49:12;"we came from nothing,"
01:49:12;01:49:15;"and now we got all these inter-scene squabbles."
01:49:15;01:49:17;"- What's the word, inter-nessing?"
01:49:17;01:49:20;"- Inter-nessing, it's very Trump to mess the word up."
01:49:20;01:49:22;"- And not give a (beep) and say it multiple times."
01:49:22;01:49:23;"I mean, I respect that part of it."
01:49:23;01:49:26;"- And then be like, you guys all suck, we all suck,"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"why don't we be better to each other,"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"but God, Mick Jagger sucks."
01:49:30;01:49:30;"- Yeah."
01:49:30;01:49:32;"- It's just like, what are you saying, dude?"
01:49:32;01:49:33;"- And also, why did he pretend"
01:49:33;01:49:35;"he doesn't know who Woody Guthrie is"
01:49:35;01:49:37;"when the whole point of the story is to say"
01:49:37;01:49:40;"that his parents had a similar background"
01:49:40;01:49:41;"to Woody Guthrie? - Right."
01:49:41;01:49:44;"- Who's the guy with the guitar, you know, Arlo?"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"- Oh yeah, well I knew-- - Arlo's father."
01:49:46;01:49:48;"- Oh right, yeah, well I knew that"
01:49:48;01:49:50;"because my father sang his songs."
01:49:50;01:49:53;"- Also, saying Mick Jagger's too chicken (beep)"
01:49:53;01:49:55;"to get on stage with the Beach Boys is like,"
01:49:55;01:49:59;"in terms of an on-stage presence,"
01:49:59;01:50:03;"I can't think of anything kind of lamer than the Beach Boys."
01:50:03;01:50:05;"The Stones, like, kicked ass."
01:50:05;01:50:06;"- Yeah, I mean-- - It's like--"
01:50:06;01:50:08;"- He's just-- - What are you talking about?"
01:50:08;01:50:09;"- I mean, I could imagine,"
01:50:09;01:50:13;"is this just like a lifetime of chips on his shoulder"
01:50:13;01:50:16;"building up to some weird thing where he's just like,"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"we're better at harmonies than the Stones?"
01:50:18;01:50:19;"- That's true."
01:50:19;01:50:22;"- Is he just trying to say Mick Jagger's too chicken (beep)"
01:50:22;01:50:25;"to try to deal with our four-part harmonies?"
01:50:25;01:50:30;"- That my cousin wrote, and I struggled to pull off my part."
01:50:30;01:50:33;"And he gave me the easiest parts to sing"
01:50:33;01:50:35;"'cause I'm the least talented in this group"
01:50:35;01:50:36;"by a mile."
01:50:36;01:50:39;"- My glove, what's going on?"
01:50:39;01:50:43;"One of the top YouTube comments,"
01:50:43;01:50:44;"""If it wasn't for the Wilson brothers,"
01:50:44;01:50:47;"""my glove would be flipping burgers somewhere."""

01:53:57;01:53:59;"- That's real weird."
01:53:59;01:54:01;"I love that it's so long ago too."
01:54:01;01:54:03;"- Also, like, just being proud that the Beach Boys"
01:54:03;01:54:06;"did 180 performances in 1987."
01:54:06;01:54:08;"What are you talking about, man?"
01:54:08;01:54:10;"- So many, like, there's a baseball game"
01:54:10;01:54:13;"that starts at one and ends at 4.30."
01:54:13;01:54:15;"Beach Boys are taking the stage!"
01:54:15;01:54:17;"(laughing)"
01:54:17;01:54:18;"- Oh, God."
01:54:18;01:54:21;"- Love is a fascinating dude."
01:54:21;01:54:23;"I mean, he put out a book recently."
01:54:23;01:54:26;"People found that pretty funny."
01:54:26;01:54:27;"All right."
01:54:27;01:54:29;"- This has been a very off-kilter, weird--"
01:54:29;01:54:32;"(laughing)"
01:54:32;01:54:34;"Weird rhythm to this show."
01:54:34;01:54:35;"It was an experiment."
01:54:35;01:54:36;"- We had to bank a lot of eps."
01:54:36;01:54:38;"I think we had some good runs in there,"
01:54:38;01:54:40;"but listen, that was a grab bag episode."
01:54:40;01:54:41;"- Yep."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"- And when you get a grab bag,"
01:54:42;01:54:44;"you never know what you're gonna get."
01:54:44;01:54:46;"Thanks to everybody who wrote in with questions."
