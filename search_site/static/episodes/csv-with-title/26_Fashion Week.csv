01:36;01:40;"Back in New York, I feel like Patrick Ewing."
01:40;01:44;"♪ Back in New York, I feel like Patrick Ewing, boy ♪"
01:44;01:45;"- Ah, every time I get back to New York,"
01:45;01:47;"I just think about that Maconan line."

01:50;01:51;"- I don't remember."
01:51;01:51;"- I don't know."
01:51;01:53;"♪ Back in New York, I feel like Patrick Ewing, boy ♪"
01:53;01:54;"- The important part is back in New York,"
01:54;01:56;"I feel like Patrick Ewing, boy."
01:56;01:58;"- I think the ""huh"" is important too."
01:58;02:00;"It's the name of the song."
02:00;02:02;"- I'm joined again by Cousin Asher and Despot."
02:02;02:03;"What's up, fellas?"
02:03;02:04;"- What's up, Ezra?"
02:04;02:05;"- Hi, man."
02:05;02:07;"- So it's the end of summer, it's fashion week."
02:07;02:09;"- Yeah, I'm wearing white pants."
02:09;02:11;"- It's the end of fashion week."
02:11;02:12;"Wait, you're not supposed to--"
02:12;02:13;"- We're breaking some rules right now."
02:13;02:15;"- It's after Labor Day."
02:15;02:19;"- I'm all about breaking that particular rule."
02:19;02:22;"I think if you adhere to that rule,"
02:22;02:26;"obviously you are not pushing any fashion boundaries,"
02:26;02:32;"and I might say you are scared, and I'm not scared."
02:32;02:34;"- Some rules are there for a reason, though."
02:34;02:36;"- So what's the reason?"
02:36;02:36;"- I don't know, man."
02:36;02:37;"I mean, it's--"
02:37;02:38;"(laughing)"
02:38;02:39;"- I can guess."
02:39;02:42;"- Well, I think in the Bible,"
02:42;02:46;"the Israelites were up to all sorts of no good."
02:46;02:49;"They were worshiping a golden calf,"
02:49;02:53;"making love in inappropriate fashions,"
02:53;02:56;"and Moses was called up the mountain by God."
02:56;02:58;"God gave him 10 commandments,"
02:58;03:00;"and he brought it back down to the people."
03:00;03:01;"- Right, and that's one of them."
03:01;03:03;"- I think that, yeah, number seven."
03:03;03:04;"- Number seven."
03:04;03:06;"- No white pants after Labor Day."
03:06;03:07;"- Right, that's true."
03:07;03:09;"I mean, I'm not really that religious,"
03:09;03:10;"so I guess I kinda just forgot."
03:10;03:12;"- You gotta get back to the synagogue, my friend."
03:12;03:13;"- You're right."
03:13;03:15;"- Some misogynists think that one of the 10 commandments"
03:15;03:16;"is bros before hoes, but it's not."
03:16;03:21;"- But it is money over B words."
03:21;03:24;"- No, it's actually cash rules everything around me."
03:24;03:25;"- Oh, okay."
03:25;03:27;"- Everybody should go talk to their rabbi or priest"
03:27;03:28;"or imam or whatever your religion is"
03:28;03:29;"and get to the bottom of it."
03:29;03:32;"- I like how you're like a feminist."
03:32;03:34;"You wouldn't allow me to even try"
03:34;03:38;"the other misogynist commandment."
03:38;03:39;"- I don't need that kind of negative energy"
03:39;03:41;"on my internet radio show."
03:41;03:43;"- That's fair."
03:43;03:45;"- I mean, we haven't had a female guest in a long time, so."
03:45;03:47;"- I identify as both."
03:47;03:48;"I'm gender fluid."
03:48;03:50;"- Oh, I'm glad to hear that."
03:50;03:52;"How's everyone's summer has been?"
03:52;03:53;"- It's good, good."
03:53;03:56;"It feels like it's time for fall."
03:56;03:58;"It's like we've had a good long run."
03:58;04:00;"It's been, it's still hot and disgusting."
04:00;04:01;"You're right, it's not up to me, but."
04:01;04:02;"- I mean, it is."
04:02;04:04;"(laughing)"
04:04;04:05;"- I think it's been good."
04:05;04:06;"Just kinda quiet and mellow."
04:06;04:09;"- Fashion week is really like the, it's like back to school."
04:09;04:11;"- Back to school fashion week."
04:11;04:12;"I feel like every school kinda has their own"
04:12;04:15;"fashion week, first week of school, too."
04:15;04:16;"- That's true, it's very important that you have"
04:16;04:18;"a good outfit on the first day of school."
04:18;04:21;"- You know that song, ""Parents Just Don't Understand""?"
04:21;04:23;"That line always stuck out to me."
04:23;04:26;"He does the fake mom voice, and his mom goes,"
04:26;04:29;"""You're going to school, not a fashion show."""
04:29;04:31;"(laughing)"

06:38;06:40;"coming through a little later,"
06:40;06:42;"and he's gonna teach us all about Fashion Week."
06:42;06:45;"Alec, I understand you were invited to,"
06:45;06:49;"but did not go to the Yeezy show, Yeezy Season 4."
06:49;06:50;"Why?"
06:50;06:52;"- I just had a really busy day."
06:52;06:54;"- Okay."
06:54;06:55;"- It's hard to get to, hard to get."
06:55;06:58;"I feel like you'd have to carve out your entire afternoon"
06:58;07:00;"to go there or go there."
07:00;07:01;"- I like that little trip."
07:01;07:02;"- For people not from New York,"
07:02;07:04;"he had it on Roosevelt Island,"
07:04;07:07;"which is not a place that a lot of people go to."
07:07;07:10;"- Doesn't like the, the F goes there."
07:10;07:11;"Doesn't the F go there?"
07:11;07:13;"- Yeah, you could also take that air gondola"
07:13;07:15;"people might remember from Spider-Man."
07:15;07:16;"- It's called a tram."
07:16;07:17;"- It's called a funicular."
07:17;07:18;"(laughing)"
07:18;07:20;"It's known for having hospitals."
07:20;07:21;"- Yeah."
07:21;07:22;"- And some people live there."
07:22;07:24;"- It was like a military base originally."
07:24;07:26;"I used to, in high school,"
07:26;07:30;"I used to see a young lady who lived there."
07:30;07:31;"So I go there a lot."
07:31;07:34;"There's one street, it's called Main Street,"
07:34;07:36;"that used to be a bus that would take you all"
07:36;07:37;"up and down Main Street."
07:37;07:38;"That was a quarter."
07:38;07:40;"I hear it's like $2 now."
07:40;07:42;"- It's a weird little island,"
07:42;07:44;"but I don't want to talk too much about fashion yet"
07:44;07:46;"'cause we have a fashion podcast coming in."
07:46;07:47;"- You know Roosevelt Island?"
07:47;07:49;"I don't know if it's still like that anymore,"
07:49;07:52;"but the NYPD used to have, when I was in high school,"
07:52;07:54;"they had no jurisdiction there."
07:54;07:55;"They'd only get called in if there was like"
07:55;07:57;"an actual emergency."
07:57;07:59;"So they had private security on Roosevelt Island."
07:59;08:02;"So you could just go kill someone and get on a train."
08:02;08:03;"And like, it's all good."
08:03;08:04;"(laughing)"
08:04;08:06;"- Private security guard might stop you."
08:06;08:07;"- Yeah, he'd come over and be like,"
08:07;08:08;"why'd you just shoot that guy?"
08:08;08:10;"And you'd be like, oh, I don't know, man."
08:10;08:12;"I got, but I gotta go."
08:12;08:14;"What's he gonna do?"
08:14;08:15;"- I mean, he's a rent-a-cop."
08:15;08:16;"- They don't have guns."
08:16;08:17;"They probably have handcuffs,"
08:17;08:18;"but like, you just killed someone."
08:18;08:20;"It's like, yo, I just killed a guy."
08:20;08:22;"You don't want to really get involved."
08:22;08:23;"Get out of here."
08:23;08:24;"- It's basically a lawless zone."
08:24;08:26;"Now, I don't think it is anymore,"
08:26;08:28;"but I, or I think maybe there are cops"
08:28;08:30;"like on the island at all times now,"
08:30;08:31;"and there didn't used to be."
08:31;08:33;"- Keep cops off Roosevelt Island."
08:33;08:35;"- That could have also just been like something"
08:35;08:37;"that that girl told me that wasn't true."
08:37;08:38;"Who knows?"
08:38;08:40;"But there was private security all over the island."
08:40;08:42;"- Man, I hate private security."

14:53;14:58;"- Filling in for our regular host Fareed Zachariah."
14:58;14:59;"- Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
14:59;15:00;"- Four, one."
15:00;15:03;"- So guys I wanna ask you a little bit about your summers."
15:03;15:05;"Asher, I'm gonna start with you."
15:05;15:06;"- Sure."
15:06;15:08;"- I had my writing staff interview you guys"
15:08;15:12;"in the green room to find out what your summers were like."
15:12;15:15;"So Asher, I heard you went to a bed and breakfast upstate."
15:15;15:16;"- That's true."
15:16;15:19;"My girlfriend and I went to a bed and breakfast"
15:19;15:21;"this weekend for Labor Day."
15:21;15:24;"- Do you think people remember what a B&B is?"
15:24;15:26;"Or do you think Airbnb killed it?"
15:26;15:27;"- I was actually just thinking about that"
15:27;15:28;"'cause I was Googling it"
15:28;15:30;"and I didn't know how,"
15:30;15:32;"I didn't write out bed and breakfast"
15:32;15:34;"and I was writing like B&B"
15:34;15:37;"and I realized I was writing it like B, the letter N,"
15:37;15:38;"and then B again."
15:38;15:41;"I realized like no one has ever written that before,"
15:41;15:43;"before Airbnb."
15:43;15:43;"- Right."
15:43;15:44;"- It's just a crazy way to write it."
15:44;15:46;"But then I thought like that must be the way"
15:46;15:48;"everybody would write it now."
15:48;15:49;"- You should use an ampersand."
15:49;15:51;"- I guess, but I don't know."
15:51;15:52;"It worked."
15:52;15:54;"- A bed and breakfast,"
15:54;15:56;"'cause you know this is a pretty educational show."
15:56;15:58;"- It feels like kind of a Northeast concept."
15:58;15:59;"- Let's talk about, yeah."
15:59;16:01;"So a bed and breakfast is different from a hotel"
16:01;16:03;"because basically it's just a house."
16:03;16:05;"- Well, I guess maybe like the traditional idea"
16:05;16:08;"of the Airbnb where someone's like renting out a room"
16:08;16:10;"is similar to it."
16:10;16:12;"But unlike what most people do with Airbnb"
16:12;16:15;"where they like rent out somebody's house and live there,"
16:15;16:18;"it's more like somebody has a house,"
16:18;16:20;"usually a house,"
16:20;16:22;"and they have like multiple rooms"
16:22;16:24;"and it's kind of like a little inn or hotel"
16:24;16:26;"and they kind of run it themselves,"
16:26;16:29;"but you're living with other people inside someone's house,"
16:29;16:31;"sometimes with the person as well."
16:31;16:33;"It's not like you have a whole home to yourself."
16:33;16:36;"- You don't have the anonymity of a hotel."
16:36;16:38;"You're usually walking into some like old house"
16:38;16:41;"and they put you in like the Rose room."
16:41;16:44;"- You know, it's kind of like some like murder mystery,"
16:44;16:45;"like clue kind of situation"
16:45;16:48;"where it's just like we invited all of these strangers"
16:48;16:49;"into this place"
16:49;16:51;"and they're all gonna spend the night here"
16:51;16:54;"and maybe you'll get to know them, maybe you won't."
16:54;16:56;"Maybe there's gonna be some weird like tension"
16:56;16:59;"and you're just for some reason all in the same house,"
16:59;17:01;"like on a hill in the woods somewhere."
17:01;17:02;"- And you all have to have breakfast together."
17:02;17:04;"- That's a weird thing."
17:04;17:06;"We kind of tried, we didn't talk about it,"
17:06;17:09;"but I think we were both like kind of waiting it out."
17:09;17:11;"I think maybe every couple there did that"
17:11;17:12;"'cause it's all couples."
17:12;17:13;"That's also a B&B thing."
17:13;17:16;"It's like, it's a little weird to go to by yourself."
17:16;17:19;"I think it's usually like just couples that are there."
17:19;17:23;"And it seems like everyone's kind of holding out"
17:23;17:25;"and waiting till it sounds like no one's downstairs"
17:25;17:27;"so they don't have to have some awkward"
17:27;17:30;"like breakfast conversation with other people."
17:30;17:32;"And it doesn't work and everyone just shows up"
17:32;17:34;"at the exact same time no matter what."
17:34;17:36;"- Don't they have like a bunch of different tables though?"
17:36;17:37;"Can't you just like go sit with them?"
17:37;17:39;"- Oh no, it's like a, it's like a,"
17:39;17:40;"there's just one dining room table."
17:40;17:41;"- Oh, sometimes, yeah. - And you're all"
17:41;17:42;"just sitting there. - Sometimes,"
17:42;17:43;"sometimes we have little tables."
17:43;17:44;"- I'm staying in my chair. - Oh, I get it."
17:44;17:45;"- Bed and breakfast."
17:45;17:46;"- All right, fair enough."
17:46;17:47;"- I'm just saying."
17:47;17:47;"- So you've been in bed and breakfast?"
17:47;17:49;"- At this one it was one table."
17:49;17:50;"- Huh?"
17:50;17:51;"- You've been in bed and breakfast?"
17:51;17:53;"- Yeah, last time was for this wedding"
17:53;17:56;"that my friend had where he got married."
17:56;18:01;"One time, the illest bed and breakfast situation I had"
18:01;18:03;"was the first tour I ever went on"
18:03;18:08;"with Clarence Reed, AKA Blowfly, rest in peace."
18:08;18:11;"We toured in a van and when we played Bard,"
18:11;18:14;"we stayed in a bed and breakfast by Bard."
18:14;18:16;"And it's me and it's like, I don't know,"
18:16;18:19;"he was probably close to 70 at the time."
18:19;18:23;"70 year old, raunchy old man who wore"
18:23;18:26;"like a superhero outfit and we were just"
18:26;18:28;"in this quiet bed and breakfast by Bard"
18:28;18:31;"and that was where I saw Blowfly's penis."
18:31;18:33;"(laughing)"
18:33;18:35;"- Why, because you guys had to share a room?"
18:35;18:36;"- Nah, he was across the hall."
18:36;18:38;"- You kicked out for breakfast."
18:38;18:40;"- So, nah, Blowfly had a thing."
18:40;18:42;"He really liked, I think he was probably diabetic"
18:42;18:43;"or something, who knows."
18:43;18:44;"- Oh no."
18:44;18:46;"- But he really liked kid food."
18:46;18:48;"He would call it kid food and that just meant like candy."
18:48;18:49;"- Candy?"
18:49;18:50;"- And stuff."
18:50;18:51;"- Oh no."
18:51;18:53;"- He also did crazy, he'd put sugar all over his pizza"
18:53;18:56;"and he'd put a slice of pie on his burger,"
18:56;18:58;"like stuff like that, he really did that."
18:58;19:00;"He put sugar in his Coke."
19:00;19:00;"- Oh my God."
19:00;19:02;"- So he'd always like, we'd get to the hotel"
19:02;19:05;"and he'd be like, somebody give me some kid food."
19:05;19:07;"And I'd be like, all right."
19:07;19:08;"- And that was your job, 'cause you were basically"
19:08;19:09;"his tour manager?"
19:09;19:11;"- Nah, his tour manager was this guy Tom,"
19:11;19:13;"who was his drummer too."
19:13;19:13;"Shout out to Tom."
19:13;19:15;"- Oh my God, you were just the opening act."
19:15;19:16;"- Yeah."
19:16;19:17;"- What did that rider look like?"
19:18;19:20;"- I can't even imagine."
19:20;19:22;"- Kid food, 3,000 Skittles."
19:22;19:25;"- They're pretty small shows, I don't know."
19:25;19:27;"I don't know if there was a rider."
19:27;19:28;"- So this guy loves sugar."
19:28;19:30;"- I went and got him like M&M's or something"
19:30;19:32;"and it was like, they weren't easy to find."
19:32;19:35;"So I finally like came through with the M&M's"
19:35;19:37;"and like opened his door to his room"
19:37;19:39;"and he was like naked and you know,"
19:39;19:41;"he like jumped under the covers and I was like,"
19:41;19:43;"oh, all right, well he's here."
19:43;19:44;"- Wait, oh, so you didn't knock?"
19:44;19:46;"- No, I don't think so."
19:47;19:49;"- You were just standing there fully naked?"
19:49;19:50;"- Yeah."
19:50;19:52;"- And then you, what, did you just approach the bed"
19:52;19:53;"with the M&M's?"
19:53;19:55;"- Well yeah, he like jumped in bed and I was like,"
19:55;19:57;"my bad, here's the M&M's."
19:57;19:59;"- He said, it's all good, come take a seat"
19:59;20:00;"and feed me the M&M's."
20:00;20:02;"- He was cool about it."
20:02;20:05;"I mean, you know, he raps about his,"
20:05;20:06;"all he raps about."
20:06;20:07;"So I saw it."
20:07;20:10;"- That's legendary and now that he's passed,"
20:10;20:12;"that's a very rare-- - How big was it?"
20:12;20:14;"- It's a very rare, oh no, I wasn't gonna say that,"
20:14;20:17;"I'm just saying it's a very rare sighting."
20:17;20:18;"- Yeah, absolutely."
20:18;20:20;"Although I imagine while he was alive,"
20:20;20:21;"it was not a rare sighting at all."
20:21;20:23;"(laughing)"

24:12;24:14;"- So Alec, when my assistant was interviewing you"
24:14;24:17;"in the green room to find out about your summer,"
24:17;24:21;"I found out that you've had a very fun summer."
24:21;24:22;"- Yeah. - Had a lot of meetings."
24:22;24:24;"- Yeah, important."
24:24;24:26;"- Important meetings, lifting weights."
24:26;24:27;"- Yeah."
24:27;24:29;"- But it hasn't all been."
24:29;24:31;"- Fun and games. - Fun and games."
24:31;24:34;"And I was very dismayed to hear a story"
24:34;24:36;"that involved you getting fish hooked."
24:36;24:37;"- Yeah."
24:37;24:39;"- And first of all, before you tell it,"
24:39;24:41;"for the listeners at home,"
24:41;24:44;"just like we taught you about what a bed and breakfast is,"
24:44;24:47;"a B&B, getting fish hooked,"
24:47;24:51;"it's when somebody puts their finger in your mouth"
24:51;24:55;"and kind of curves their finger and pulls at your lips"
24:55;25:00;"and cheek as if you are a fish caught on a hook."
25:00;25:02;"- Yes, I say that's accurate."
25:02;25:06;"And I'd say it's generally done during sex."
25:06;25:07;"- Wait, really?"
25:07;25:08;"- Yeah, absolutely."
25:08;25:11;"- Oh yeah, I get fish hooked all the time, man."
25:11;25:14;"(laughing)"
25:14;25:15;"I love to get fish hooked."
25:15;25:18;"I always thought of it as more of a disrespectful thing."
25:18;25:20;"- I mean. - Okay, well, so hold on."
25:20;25:22;"Is this, okay, so now."
25:22;25:23;"- Yeah, so then what was the situation?"
25:23;25:26;"- Was this a sex situation or a disrespect situation?"
25:26;25:28;"Not that they're mutually exclusive."
25:28;25:30;"(laughing)"
25:30;25:32;"- It was definitely a disrespect situation."
25:32;25:35;"I think maybe with implications of a sex situation."
25:35;25:38;"- Oh, this is a really juicy story."
25:38;25:41;"All right, man, so let's get into it, guys."
25:41;25:43;"This is Despot's Fish Hook Story."
25:43;25:49;"- All right, so this was what, like last week?"
25:49;25:51;"(laughing)"
25:51;25:53;"- Imagine last week."
25:53;25:55;"- Yeah, imagine it's last week."
25:55;25:55;"- Okay."
25:55;25:59;"- My dear friend Action Bronson, who is a rapper,"
25:59;26:03;"had a concert at Coney Island at this amphitheater there"
26:03;26:05;"that I've never been to."
26:05;26:08;"I have been to this baseball stadium there,"
26:08;26:10;"but this is next to it, different spot."
26:10;26:12;"- Ah, so you're down by the beach?"
26:12;26:13;"- Yep, I'm up by the boardwalk."
26:13;26:14;"- Ah, okay, so I bet that has something to do"
26:14;26:15;"with getting fish hooked."
26:15;26:16;"- Yeah, it might."
26:16;26:18;"- By the ocean, by the fish, all right."
26:18;26:21;"- So Action Bronson has a friend"
26:21;26:22;"who is also a friend of mine,"
26:22;26:26;"who's like a sidekick of sorts, named Big Body Bess,"
26:26;26:28;"who is, you know, a great guy."
26:28;26:32;"Upon arriving at the show with my Graffiti Gang smart crew,"
26:32;26:34;"we saw this guy walking around"
26:34;26:36;"who looked a lot like Big Body Bess."
26:36;26:40;"He was like a big guy, very big, kind of fat, tall,"
26:40;26:43;"bald guy, and he had a tank top on"
26:43;26:45;"that sort of looked like a fake Coogee tank top,"
26:45;26:48;"which is something Big Body has worn in the past,"
26:48;26:49;"so it was really weird."
26:49;26:51;"And you know, throughout the night and the show,"
26:51;26:55;"we were kind of like making fun of him amongst ourselves,"
26:55;26:57;"not like, not making fun of him directly,"
26:57;26:59;"not trying to like play him or anything."
26:59;27:02;"- You were just having a laugh"
27:02;27:04;"that he looked like an off-brand version of your friend."
27:04;27:07;"- Yeah, and it seemed kind of intentional too,"
27:07;27:08;"so it was like, you signed up for this, man,"
27:08;27:09;"we're making fun of you."
27:09;27:11;"At least we're not like walking up to you"
27:11;27:14;"and yelling at you about looking the way you look, you know?"
27:14;27:16;"- So some lighthearted snickering."
27:16;27:17;"- Lighthearted snickering"
27:17;27:18;"that he definitely was not privy to,"
27:18;27:20;"so it's not like we were upsetting him."
27:20;27:21;"He didn't know."
27:21;27:23;"He didn't know he was being made fun of."
27:23;27:25;"The whole show finishes,"
27:25;27:29;"and it was somehow like a Sports Illustrated sponsored thing."
27:29;27:30;"So there's all these like--"
27:30;27:31;"- There's a lot of athletes."
27:31;27:34;"- Swimsuit issue, it was the swimsuit issue like thing,"
27:34;27:35;"and there were these--"
27:35;27:36;"- A lot of linebackers."
27:36;27:38;"- Yeah, a lot of linebackers in bikinis."
27:38;27:39;"- Nice."
27:39;27:41;"- They have their own private section in the front,"
27:41;27:43;"it's like models and like weird rich guys or whatever."
27:43;27:44;"- Love it."
27:44;27:45;"- Yeah."
27:45;27:46;"(laughing)"
27:46;27:47;"- My kind of party."
27:47;27:49;"- A Sports Illustrated after party,"
27:49;27:52;"after the show, on the roof of the venue."
27:52;27:54;"And you know, we went up there,"
27:54;27:56;"action wasn't even there, body wasn't there either,"
27:56;27:57;"so we were kind of like,"
27:57;27:59;"""Oh, we're not gonna stay here very long, this is corny."""
27:59;28:02;"But here, you know, lo and behold,"
28:02;28:04;"fake Big Body Best is in front of us,"
28:04;28:05;"and we're drunk now."
28:05;28:08;"So, you know, we're talking (beep)"
28:08;28:10;"and looking at him or whatever,"
28:10;28:12;"and then I think we were kind of about to leave,"
28:12;28:14;"and I was like, ""I'm gonna go take a picture with him."
28:14;28:16;"""I'm gonna go walk up to him and be like,"
28:16;28:18;"""Oh, Big Body Best, man, can I get a picture?"""
28:18;28:20;"So I did that."
28:20;28:22;"And it was hard to tell,"
28:22;28:23;"'cause as I said, he didn't know"
28:23;28:25;"we had been making fun of him all night,"
28:25;28:27;"so he might have thought that I really thought"
28:27;28:29;"he was Big Body Best, and I was a fan."
28:29;28:31;"- And on the disrespect train,"
28:31;28:34;"that's not very far down the track."
28:34;28:34;"- No."
28:34;28:36;"- To go up to somebody and say,"
28:36;28:39;"""Oh, I think you're somebody who looks vaguely like you."""
28:39;28:42;"- Right, and even if I knew he wasn't Big Body,"
28:42;28:43;"he's kind of in on the joke."
28:43;28:45;"It's not like I'm really trying to play him."
28:45;28:47;"It's like, okay, so whatever."
28:47;28:50;"- And also, Big Body Best is cool."
28:50;28:52;"If you like Action Bronson,"
28:52;28:53;"you think Big Body Best is cool."
28:53;28:54;"- Yes."
28:54;28:57;"- It's not like you went up to a large, bald man"
28:57;28:58;"and said, ""What up, Shrek?"""
28:58;29:01;"- Right, he did look like Shrek or King Hippo."
29:01;29:03;"- What up, King Hippo?"
29:06;29:10;"- So, whatever, I go up to the guy, ask for a picture."
29:10;29:12;"He's like, ""Yeah, cool."""
29:12;29:14;"And I was with my friend Danny, who's a big guy."
29:14;29:16;"He's the CEO of All-Americans Island."
29:16;29:18;"The guy puts his arms around both of us."
29:18;29:20;"He's bigger than both of us."
29:20;29:21;"I mean, obviously bigger than me,"
29:21;29:25;"but Danny's a more regular-sized man."
29:25;29:25;"It's fine."
29:25;29:27;"I feel like, all right, this guy has a sense of humor."
29:27;29:28;"We're taking this picture."
29:28;29:29;"It's fine."
29:29;29:32;"And my friend Mikey, I think, was taking the picture."
29:32;29:35;"And he snaps like, you know, two or three pictures."
29:35;29:39;"And then I feel a hand kind of on my cheek."
29:39;29:43;"And you can see, there's a few pictures."
29:43;29:44;"- Could this have just been like him"
29:44;29:46;"playing around for the camera?"
29:46;29:46;"- Hold on."
29:46;29:47;"- Okay."
29:47;29:50;"- Sorry, I'm gonna cut ahead of your story."
29:50;29:51;"- Yes, it could have been."
29:51;29:53;"- This is why we call this the fishhook story."
29:53;29:55;"Well, I feel, I don't wanna, okay, let's see."
29:55;29:58;"- Okay, so it's funny because there was like"
29:58;30:02;"two pictures taken pre any face touching,"
30:02;30:04;"and my face looks really regular."
30:04;30:05;"And then if you look at the one"
30:05;30:07;"where there's suddenly a hand on my face,"
30:07;30:09;"my face looks like, what's going on here?"
30:09;30:11;"- It's like the Zapruder tape."
30:11;30:12;"- And when you look at Danny's face,"
30:12;30:14;"maybe he was so drunk that he,"
30:14;30:15;"'cause he was also fishhooking Danny."
30:15;30:16;"- Oh!"
30:16;30:17;"- Oh, wow."
30:17;30:18;"- So, all right, so anyway,"
30:18;30:20;"this guy puts his hands on our faces,"
30:20;30:23;"and he attempts, he like kinda touches my lip."
30:23;30:26;"And that's when I was like, yo, what's going on here?"
30:26;30:30;"And the guy was like, we fishhooking inwards all day."
30:30;30:32;"And I was just like, hmm."
30:32;30:35;"- We don't wanna blaze by this, this is important."
30:35;30:39;"So, this was a double attempted fishhook."
30:39;30:40;"- Yeah."
30:40;30:42;"- A man had his arms around two strangers."
30:42;30:43;"- Yeah."
30:43;30:45;"- And he attempted to fishhook them."
30:45;30:45;"So--"
30:45;30:46;"- On camera."
30:46;30:47;"- Yeah."
30:47;30:49;"- His dirty king hippo finger--"
30:49;30:49;"- Yeah."
30:49;30:51;"- Did it actually make it into your mouth?"
30:51;30:52;"- No, absolutely not."
30:52;30:54;"- But it grazed your lips."
30:54;30:57;"- Yes, the edge, the corner of my mouth, yeah."
30:57;31:01;"- Having a stranger touch you in any way is uncomfortable."
31:01;31:05;"To have them touch your lips is very unpleasant."
31:05;31:06;"And then on top of this,"
31:06;31:09;"this was a large Caucasian male yelling the N-word."
31:09;31:10;"- Yes."
31:10;31:12;"- That's three strikes."
31:12;31:15;"- And, right, and like, you know, I was a little drunk,"
31:15;31:20;"so I was trying to like, in my head, be like,"
31:20;31:21;"maybe he didn't do that on purpose."
31:21;31:24;"Maybe he was just like, he put his hand there by accident."
31:24;31:26;"But then he said that, and I was like,"
31:26;31:28;"aw, this was not an accident."
31:28;31:30;"And now I have to feel a certain way about it."
31:30;31:32;"So I was just, but even still--"
31:32;31:34;"- This was first degree attempted fishhooking."
31:34;31:35;"- Yeah."
31:35;31:36;"- Premeditated."
31:36;31:39;"- I was cool about it, and I'm generally not,"
31:39;31:40;"'cause I like fighting people."
31:40;31:43;"So I was like, but I was cool about it."
31:43;31:45;"I'm like, I'm at my friend's show,"
31:45;31:47;"I don't wanna make a scene, you know,"
31:47;31:49;"like it's whatever, it's fine."
31:49;31:50;"And I was fine."
31:50;31:52;"And Danny was fine too, so I was like,"
31:52;31:54;"if Danny's not being upset about it,"
31:54;31:56;"then like, I shouldn't be the guy"
31:56;31:58;"who makes a big deal out of this."
31:58;32:00;"I walk away for a second."
32:00;32:01;"Mikey gives me my phone back,"
32:01;32:03;"which he was taking the picture with,"
32:03;32:06;"and he says, what's going on over there?"
32:06;32:08;"And I was like, what do you mean?"
32:08;32:11;"And he was like, the guy said he was fishhooking,"
32:11;32:13;"and he put his hand out of your mouth."
32:13;32:15;"And I was like, yeah, he did."
32:15;32:17;"And he was like, go smack him."
32:17;32:19;"And I was like, all right."
32:19;32:23;"I walked back over to the guy, and I smacked him."
32:23;32:28;"And security came over, and I think the security guard"
32:28;32:30;"was even kinda like, looking at me,"
32:30;32:33;"like you are the size of this guy's leg."
32:33;32:34;"What's going on?"
32:34;32:35;"And he was like, what happened?"
32:35;32:38;"And I was like, I mean, the guy touched my face."
32:38;32:39;"- I think you should've specifically said"
32:39;32:41;"it was an attempted fishhooking."
32:41;32:42;"- It was a double attempted fishhooking."
32:42;32:44;"And he was just like, well, you got,"
32:44;32:45;"he was very polite about it."
32:45;32:46;"He was like, well, you guys all have to leave."
32:46;32:47;"I have to kick you out."
32:47;32:48;"- Right."
32:48;32:49;"- And we were like, that's totally fine."
32:49;32:50;"And we walked. - That's nice."
32:50;32:52;"- You know, we left laughing heartily, and it was fine."
32:52;32:55;"- I understand from the point of view of honor."
32:55;32:56;"- Yes."
32:56;32:59;"- That honor would not allow you to walk away"
32:59;33:00;"from an attempted fishhooking,"
33:00;33:02;"but you also have to leave the party."
33:02;33:03;"- Honestly, I would've done it."
33:03;33:05;"I would've probably walked away from it"
33:05;33:07;"if Mikey didn't point out that it was"
33:07;33:09;"extremely disrespectful, which it was."
33:09;33:11;"But I was kinda, I was trying to be cool."
33:11;33:13;"- No, I think you did the right thing."
33:13;33:14;"That's really out of line for somebody"
33:14;33:16;"to put their hands on you like that."
33:16;33:19;"And I mean, honestly, in feudal Japan,"
33:19;33:22;"if you were a samurai who was fishhooked"
33:22;33:24;"by another samurai, they would have to kill themselves."
33:24;33:26;"- Yeah, that's true."
33:26;33:26;"- So."
33:26;33:28;"- Well, the samurai would have to kill himself"
33:28;33:30;"if he didn't retaliate."
33:30;33:33;"- Right, if he retaliated after the fishhooking, yeah."
33:33;33:36;"And, you know, if he didn't avenge his honor."
33:36;33:40;"- If another samurai who belonged to a different clan,"
33:40;33:43;"who was a rival of your master, fishhooked you,"
33:43;33:45;"and escaped before you could retaliate,"
33:45;33:46;"and just vanish you."
33:46;33:47;"- You'd kill yourself, for sure."
33:47;33:48;"- Kill yourself?"
33:48;33:49;"- Yeah."
33:49;33:52;"Well, thankfully I didn't have to do that."
33:52;33:55;"'Cause I do consider myself a samurai to some degree."

35:02;35:04;"what would you do if you were fish hooked?"
35:04;35:05;"- I would let the fish hook happen,"
35:05;35:07;"then I bite on the finger."

35:18;35:20;"What if they have Zika?"
35:20;35:22;"- Yeah, I didn't think about that."
35:22;35:25;"- Your logic is you mess with the bull, you get the horns."
35:25;35:28;"- Exactly, punishment fits the crime."
35:28;35:31;"- I'm ashamed to admit that if I was fish hooked by somebody"
35:31;35:34;"I would probably walk away."
35:35;35:35;"I don't know if I would do that."
35:35;35:37;"- You never know though, until you're there, you know?"
35:37;35:39;"- That's true."
35:39;35:40;"I think probably the last time I was fish hooked"
35:40;35:45;"was probably like wrestling when I was like 12."
35:45;35:47;"- So is that an illegal move?"
35:47;35:48;"I assume so."
35:48;35:49;"- Oh, it's very dishonorable."
35:49;35:52;"That's something that a villain would do."
35:52;35:54;"- I honestly, that's the other thing."
35:54;35:56;"- Hulk Hogan would never fish hook somebody."
35:56;35:58;"- The kid said fish hooking or whatever"
35:58;36:00;"and it didn't even register with me"
36:00;36:02;"'cause it's not really a thing that's in my vocabulary."
36:02;36:04;"- Oh, so you didn't think when it happened,"
36:04;36:05;"like I just got fish hooked."
36:05;36:06;"- He tried to fish hook me."
36:06;36:08;"It was more like the guy touched my face."
36:08;36:09;"What was that about?"
36:09;36:10;"Then he said fish hook and it didn't register."
36:10;36:11;"Then Mikey--"
36:11;36:14;"- And let's not forget, a large Caucasian man"
36:14;36:15;"said fish hooking N-words."
36:15;36:16;"- Yes."
36:16;36:19;"- I think a large Caucasian man"
36:19;36:22;"fish hooking people using the N-word,"
36:22;36:24;"I mean, he's lucky he got away with a slap."
36:24;36:25;"- It's true."
36:25;36:27;"It's true."
36:27;36:29;"- What's some good fish hooking music to listen to"
36:29;36:30;"after that incredible story?"
36:30;36:34;"Do you know any songs by Fish?"
36:34;36:35;"- No."
36:35;36:36;"(laughing)"
36:36;36:39;"I'm trying to think of something that is about fishing."
36:39;36:42;"- I love fishing songs."
36:42;36:43;"- Oh, I know a song."
36:43;36:45;"- What you got?"
36:45;36:46;"- I mean, it's like a country song."
36:46;36:47;"It's called ""Fishing in the Dark"""
36:47;36:49;"by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band."

38:10;38:13;"(phone ringing)"
38:13;38:14;"- And now we got a call in"
38:14;38:16;"from our West Coast correspondent, Jake Longstreth."
38:16;38:17;"What's up, Jake?"
38:17;38:18;"- Hey, man."
38:18;38:19;"- Where you calling from?"
38:19;38:21;"You at home in Los Angeles?"
38:21;38:22;"- Yeah, yep."
38:22;38:24;"Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, huh?"
38:24;38:26;"- Yeah, well, Despa was just telling a story"
38:26;38:27;"about getting fish hooked."
38:27;38:29;"Have you ever been fish hooked?"
38:29;38:30;"- No."
38:30;38:31;"- You know what it is, right?"
38:31;38:32;"- No."
38:32;38:33;"- It's when some scumbag"
38:33;38:35;"sticks their finger in your mouth"
38:35;38:37;"and pulls as if you're a fish."
38:37;38:38;"- What?"
38:38;38:39;"- You know, like--"
38:39;38:41;"- I thought maybe he was out at a river"
38:41;38:43;"and someone was casting a line"
38:43;38:45;"and he got a fish hook in the face."
38:45;38:46;"- That'd be worse."
38:46;38:47;"(laughing)"
38:47;38:49;"- No, this is like when sometimes a double fish hook"
38:49;38:51;"would stick two fingers in your mouth."
38:51;38:52;"You never--"
38:52;38:53;"- Sometimes a sexual thing."
38:53;38:56;"- Honestly, I was totally unfamiliar with it"
38:56;38:57;"until it happened to me,"
38:57;38:59;"so I'm kinda surprised that you are as familiar"
38:59;39:00;"with it as you are."
39:00;39:01;"I don't know what that means."
39:01;39:03;"- I feel like when you're like 10 or 11,"
39:03;39:05;"there's always some fool trying to fish hook you"
39:05;39:08;"at the sleepover when you're doing wrestling moves."
39:08;39:11;"- I feel like I've been gapped and charley-horsed,"
39:11;39:13;"but I have never fish hooked."
39:13;39:13;"I've never heard of that."
39:13;39:14;"That's crazy."
39:14;39:16;"- Well, you should count your blessings, my friend."
39:16;39:17;"- What about gills?"
39:17;39:18;"You know about gills?"
39:18;39:20;"That's, maybe that's New York."
39:20;39:22;"A gill is when you would take your hand"
39:22;39:23;"and put it on the back of someone's neck"
39:23;39:25;"and kinda slide it,"
39:25;39:27;"like to do a little burn type thing."
39:27;39:30;"That was a big thing in New York City junior high school."
39:30;39:31;"Someone would say something stupid"
39:31;39:33;"and you'd be like, ""Shh, gill."""
39:33;39:34;"- Damn."
39:34;39:36;"- Or if you weren't ready to gill them at that moment,"
39:36;39:38;"you go, ""Save mine,"""
39:38;39:40;"and later on you gill them."
39:40;39:42;"(laughing)"
39:42;39:43;"- That's for that stupid shit you said at lunch."
39:43;39:44;"- Yeah."
39:44;39:46;"- Does it make like a mark on their neck or something?"
39:46;39:47;"- If you're good at it."
39:47;39:48;"- All right."
39:48;39:49;"- These are all things that people shouldn't do"
39:49;39:50;"to each other."
39:50;39:52;"Tom Crisis has got a very firm stance."
39:52;39:54;"You don't put your hands on other people,"
39:54;39:56;"except in self-defense,"
39:56;39:58;"or to retaliate from a fishhook or a gill."
39:58;39:59;"So Jake, I'm very excited"
39:59;40:02;"because I actually have no idea at all"
40:02;40:04;"what you have on deck for us."
40:04;40:05;"I assume it has something to do"
40:05;40:07;"with corporate America or brands,"
40:07;40:09;"but what you got, man?"
40:09;40:10;"- Well, first things first,"
40:10;40:12;"I wanted to read an email from a listener."
40:12;40:14;"- From a Tom Crisis listener?"
40:14;40:15;"- Oh yeah."
40:15;40:16;"- Oh yeah, amazing."
40:16;40:17;"- James in Dallas,"
40:17;40:21;"he wrote me an email about the Frito-Lay and PepsiCo"
40:21;40:23;"episode that we got into a month or two ago."
40:23;40:24;"- Oh, okay."
40:24;40:25;"Yeah, please read it."
40:25;40:28;"- So he writes, ""Jake, hello."
40:28;40:31;"""I grew up in the suburbs around Dallas, the Big D."
40:31;40:33;"""So roughly half of my friends from high school"
40:33;40:37;"""work for the Frito-Lay North America Division of PepsiCo."
40:37;40:41;"""In casual conversation the other day,"
40:41;40:43;"""one such friend who works in the marketing group"
40:43;40:47;"""for Lay's Kettle Cooked Jalapeno Flavored Potato Chips."""
40:47;40:48;"- Oh."
40:48;40:49;"- Those are good."
40:49;40:50;"- Maybe that's an embellishment,"
40:50;40:51;"but listen, - Yeah, okay."
40:51;40:52;"- what?"
40:52;40:53;"- ""Brought up a fact I found so remarkable"
40:53;40:55;"""I wanted to share."
40:55;40:58;"""The Frito chip, marketed as Fritos,"
40:58;41:00;"""is a billion dollar brand."
41:00;41:02;"""No surprise there, but here's the thing."
41:02;41:05;"""It's a billion dollar brand that does zero marketing."
41:05;41:08;"""Not one cent was spent on marketing Fritos last year,"
41:08;41:11;"""and they grossed over one billion in sales."""
41:11;41:13;"- Wow. - Mind-blowing stuff."
41:13;41:16;"Anyway, love the show, James in Dallas."
41:16;41:17;"- Wow. - Wow."
41:17;41:20;"- Shout out to James in Dallas, that's an incredible fact."
41:20;41:22;"- Wow, I guess when you think about it,"
41:22;41:24;"when was the last time you saw a Fritos commercial?"
41:24;41:25;"- Yeah, but that's like,"
41:25;41:28;"they probably spent a lot of money on marketing"
41:28;41:31;"in the early years, and they built a strong foundation."
41:31;41:35;"- Yeah, but you got mostly young people eating it,"
41:35;41:37;"and they've never seen anything like that."
41:37;41:39;"I was also thinking, like,"
41:39;41:40;"after we were talking about that other stuff,"
41:40;41:43;"how you have something like Doritos rebrands itself,"
41:43;41:46;"like every three years the bags look different,"
41:46;41:47;"they have some different logo or something."
41:47;41:49;"Fritos has looked exactly the same,"
41:49;41:51;"I think, since we've been alive."
41:51;41:53;"Like, it's like the same, like,"
41:53;41:55;"'70s yellow and orange stripe. - The same nasty yellow."
41:55;41:56;"- Yeah, the '70s."
41:56;41:58;"- Looks like the bag's 30 years old."
41:58;42:02;"- I wish that as somebody who's built a lot of strong brands"
42:02;42:05;"such as Ezukanda Corporation, Vampire Weekend, and Time Crisis,"
42:05;42:07;"I wish it was as simple as just building a strong brand"
42:07;42:09;"and then just, like, letting it sell."
42:09;42:12;"But, you know, like, look at, like, Coca-Cola."
42:12;42:15;"Those guys spend billions of dollars every year,"
42:15;42:18;"even though that's a Heritage brand, or Levi's."
42:18;42:21;"They always gotta feed the beast, and you know what else?"
42:21;42:22;"They gotta make sure that their market share"
42:22;42:26;"doesn't get eaten into by some upstarts."
42:26;42:27;"You know, I hate to say it, it's very morbid,"
42:27;42:31;"but a lot of the hardcore Fritos lovers are dying."
42:31;42:32;"- Yeah."
42:32;42:34;"- A lot of the older-- - So, here's the thing, though."
42:34;42:36;"I feel like it might tie into the vending machine thing"
42:36;42:38;"we were talking about, where there's, like,"
42:38;42:41;"millions of vending machines all over the world,"
42:41;42:44;"and they're gonna stock Fritos in the vending machines."
42:44;42:46;"So that's, like, a constant source of sales."
42:46;42:48;"- Or, like, the variety packs."
42:48;42:49;"- Right. - They're just, like,"
42:49;42:52;"one of four. - Yeah, totally."
42:52;42:53;"So even though it's not maybe, like,"
42:53;42:56;"a hugely popular chip, it's, like, a standby."
42:56;42:58;"- And there's also guaranteed space,"
42:58;43:01;"because Frito-Lay is kinda like the mafia."
43:01;43:03;"They take over a certain vending machine,"
43:03;43:06;"even if the kids would rather, you know,"
43:06;43:09;"have something more exciting in the vending machine."
43:09;43:13;"Frito-Lay's not gonna let some upstart get that space."
43:13;43:15;"There's gonna be Fritos in there."
43:15;43:16;"- Absolutely."
43:16;43:17;"- That's incredible."

44:18;44:20;"- Can I drop a bomb on you about Oreos?"
44:20;44:21;"- Oh!"
44:21;44:22;"- Oh, I love it."
44:22;44:23;"- Oh, I can't wait."
44:23;44:24;"(explosion)"

44:27;44:28;"Creamfield chocolate sandwich cookie."
44:28;44:29;"- Is it Hydrox?"
44:29;44:30;"- Oh, Hydrox, right?"
44:30;44:32;"- Oh, okay, you guys are tapped in."
44:32;44:34;"(laughing)"
44:34;44:34;"- Let's get it."
44:34;44:39;"- Yeah, Hydrox came out in 1908, four years before Oreo."
44:39;44:43;"But then, Oreo was so popular that Hydrox acquired"
44:43;44:45;"the reputation of being the rip-off,"
44:45;44:47;"even though it was the original."
44:47;44:49;"And then it went out of business in '99,"
44:49;44:50;"but now it's back, dude."
44:50;44:51;"- Really?"
44:51;44:53;"- Hydrox is being manufactured now"
44:53;44:56;"in Vernon, California, just south of here."
44:56;44:57;"- Really?"
44:57;45:00;"Did a bunch of hipsters buy it to market it"
45:00;45:02;"as the made-in-America alternative?"
45:02;45:03;"- Yeah."
45:03;45:04;"- The Polaroid."
45:04;45:05;"- Or artisanal Brooklyn Oreo."
45:05;45:07;"Wait, wait, how did you guys know"
45:07;45:10;"that Hydrox was the original?"
45:10;45:11;"- I mean, I used to like Hydrox,"
45:11;45:14;"and I always suspected that, because it happened,"
45:14;45:16;"I feel like that happened with a lot of things in my youth,"
45:16;45:19;"like Ghostbusters and the real Ghostbusters, for example."
45:19;45:21;"(laughing)"
45:21;45:23;"Weren't the real Ghostbusters,"
45:23;45:26;"who were the Hanna-Barbera Ghostbusters."
45:26;45:27;"- They were the fake ones."
45:27;45:28;"- They were fake, but they were called"
45:28;45:31;"the real Ghostbusters, and stuff like that"
45:31;45:33;"is very confusing, so I think I developed"
45:33;45:36;"like a sense for that when I was really young."
45:36;45:40;"And I think I found out that Hydrox was the real Oreos,"
45:40;45:42;"and I was like, I only (beep) with Hydrox."
45:42;45:43;"- I think my parents told me."
45:43;45:45;"I think that's the kind of thing that if--"
45:45;45:46;"- They sat you down?"
45:46;45:49;"- If somebody in your family,"
45:49;45:53;"say probably great-grandma or great-grandpa, was around,"
45:53;45:54;"you know, that's the type of thing"
45:54;45:55;"that you're gonna tell your kids,"
45:55;45:57;"and your kids are gonna tell their kids,"
45:57;46:00;"and pass it down, because that's that kind of heritage"
46:00;46:05;"that obviously the corporate media is gonna totally bury,"
46:05;46:07;"'cause they're gonna be hyping Oreos,"
46:07;46:10;"but I think in terms of family lore,"
46:10;46:12;"that's the only way it gets passed down."
46:12;46:13;"- It might actually have something to do"
46:13;46:14;"with local knowledge, too, because--"
46:14;46:15;"- Yeah, where's Hydrox from?"
46:15;46:17;"- Well, they're coming out of New Jersey and New York."
46:17;46:19;"- Oh. - That's possible."
46:19;46:21;"- How about RC Cola, were they first?"
46:21;46:23;"- I don't think so. - No, right?"
46:23;46:24;"- That's a good question."
46:24;46:25;"I mean, I feel like probably a lot of our"
46:25;46:28;"quote-unquote heritage brands,"
46:28;46:31;"the backstory is something akin to there will be blood."
46:31;46:32;"- Right. - That's just America."
46:32;46:34;"I bet if you looked and you went through,"
46:34;46:37;"like, you know, McDonald's as the forthcoming film,"
46:37;46:40;"the founder points out, was kind of, like,"
46:40;46:43;"shadily maybe taken from the McDonald's brothers"
46:43;46:48;"by a legendary gangster, Ray Kroc, Coca-Cola, who knows?"
46:48;46:50;"- Jelly Belly. - Jelly Belly?"
46:50;46:51;"What's the story of Jelly Belly?"
46:51;46:53;"- There's a crazy documentary I saw about Jelly Belly"
46:53;46:56;"where basically the guy got swindled"
46:56;46:58;"out of the entire fortune of the company,"
46:58;47:01;"the guy who invented jelly, like, Mr. Jelly Belly"
47:01;47:03;"used to go on TV, he was just a nice guy"
47:03;47:06;"and didn't have a lawyer and got totally screwed."
47:06;47:08;"- Oh, God, dang. - They just stole it from him."
47:08;47:09;"- Nice guys really finish last."
47:09;47:11;"I seem to recall, you know we don't fact check anything"
47:11;47:14;"on this show, outside of Jake's segments,"
47:14;47:16;"but I seem to recall once I was reading"
47:16;47:18;"about the history of Victoria's Secret,"
47:18;47:19;"'cause I was kind of like,"
47:19;47:21;"why is it called Victoria's Secret?"
47:21;47:25;"I feel like that brand also ended in a founder's suicide."
47:25;47:27;"- Is that the secret?"
47:27;47:29;"- Oh, God, maybe that's the secret."
47:29;47:31;"I think it was like something kind of brutal like that."
47:31;47:33;"- The secret is that it was actually a murder."
47:33;47:34;"- I mean, it was a murder."
47:34;47:37;"But you know, I think there's, you know,"
47:37;47:39;"history's written by the victors."
47:39;47:40;"- True."
47:40;47:41;"- I love to think about the snacks"
47:41;47:43;"with the industry being so cutthroat."
47:43;47:45;"- I mean, like you said,"
47:45;47:50;"if Fritos pulling in a billion a year, I mean."
47:50;47:51;"- That's a lot of money there."
47:51;47:53;"- That's a lot of money."
47:53;47:53;"- Yeah."
47:53;47:56;"- It's hard to picture it, like I've never seen anybody"
47:56;47:59;"like buy a big bag of Fritos in my entire life."
47:59;48:00;"- I have."
48:00;48:01;"- I've seen it."
48:01;48:03;"- Like, show up at a party with a giant bag of Fritos."
48:03;48:04;"- Yeah, really?"
48:04;48:05;"- And plan some kind of dip or something."
48:05;48:07;"- Like a big bag of Fritos?"
48:07;48:10;"- Yeah, I don't know, yeah."
48:10;48:13;"- I just feel like, like never is that the only option."
48:13;48:16;"So it's like you have Doritos there,"
48:16;48:18;"you would choose that, Tostitos, obviously."
48:18;48:19;"- Yo, I just thought of something."
48:19;48:21;"I'm really taking the show full circle."
48:21;48:25;"I feel like if that guy had actually gotten his finger"
48:25;48:28;"in your mouth, it would have tasted like Fritos."
48:28;48:31;"- Nah, probably like Cheetos or Doritos."
48:31;48:34;"- I think he would have had Cheetos dust on it."
48:34;48:35;"(laughing)"
48:35;48:36;"- That guy was definitely dusted."
48:36;48:37;"- Yeah."
48:37;48:38;"(laughing)"
52:13;52:24;"- Just to wrap it up,"
52:24;52:26;"how do you think we should feel about Oreos"
52:26;52:27;"knowing that they,"
52:27;52:31;"did Oreos like steal Hydrox's intellectual property?"
52:31;52:32;"- Probably."
52:32;52:33;"- By today's standards,"
52:33;52:35;"yeah, they would have gotten sued."
52:35;52:38;"But I just feel like early 20th century,"
52:38;52:41;"maybe the game was a little looser back then."
52:41;52:44;"- What if we encourage our listeners to only buy Hydrox"
52:44;52:46;"and we boycott Oreo?"
52:46;52:47;"- What?"
52:47;52:48;"- I love that."
52:48;52:49;"- Although we did find out that Donald Trump"
52:49;52:50;"was boycotting Oreos,"
52:50;52:51;"so I don't even know which side to fall on."
52:51;52:52;"- Oh, damn."
52:52;52:54;"- I'm not eating Oreos anymore, you know that."
52:54;52:55;"- He was boycotting Oreos"
52:55;52:58;"because the production plant was moving down to Mexico."
52:58;52:59;"- Oh, right."
52:59;53:01;"Oh, yeah, so, oh, yeah."
53:01;53:03;"- It was moving from Illinois to Mexico."
53:03;53:04;"- And Donald Trump was mad about that."
53:04;53:06;"- You know the company that ate Oreos"
53:06;53:09;"is called Mondelez International."
53:09;53:10;"- International?"
53:10;53:12;"- It used to be Kraft."
53:12;53:14;"It got rebranded as Mondelez International."
53:14;53:16;"- But is it, Kraft still owns it?"
53:16;53:17;"- No."
53:17;53:18;"- Who owns Kraft though?"
53:18;53:20;"- Well, Kraft split up."
53:20;53:21;"- Okay."
53:21;53:25;"- Kraft split up into a snack food company called Mondelez."
53:25;53:27;"And then a grocery company,"
53:27;53:29;"this is called Kraft Foods."
53:29;53:30;"- Okay."
53:30;53:33;"- That sounds like some classic smoke and mirrors."
53:33;53:33;"- Oh, yeah, no."
53:33;53:35;"- That's a classic Illuminati tactic"
53:35;53:39;"is to, the illusion of separation."
53:39;53:40;"- Right."
53:40;53:42;"- Yeah, and the logo of Mondelez looks like,"
53:42;53:43;"like the logo would be on like a--"
53:43;53:44;"- Is it a triangle, an I?"
53:44;53:45;"- It's like this purple lettering"
53:45;53:47;"that looks like it would be like on the soda label,"
53:47;53:49;"like a Mexican soda."
53:49;53:51;"- So they're trying to make you think"
53:51;53:53;"it's like some rinky dink, like mom and pop company."
53:53;53:55;"- Exactly."
53:55;53:56;"- You know what it's like?"
53:56;53:58;"It's like super PACs when they're like paid for"
53:58;54:01;"by the American people for prosperity or whatever."
54:01;54:04;"And then it's like, of course it's the same rich guys."
54:04;54:05;"- Right."
54:05;54:06;"- So I don't think we can get to the bottom of it today,"
54:06;54:08;"but for everybody listening at home,"
54:08;54:12;"I want you guys to crowdsource our morality."
54:12;54:14;"I'm a big fan of crowdsource morality"
54:14;54:17;"and do some research, talk amongst your friends"
54:17;54:21;"and find out as a moral person with a strong moral compass"
54:21;54:25;"who believes in the equality of all human beings"
54:25;54:27;"and believes that we need to take care of each other."
54:27;54:30;"Should we be eating Hydrox or Oreos?"
54:30;54:32;"I'd love to hear, please tweet at us"
54:32;54:35;"and let us know which is the moral choice"
54:35;54:37;"'cause we don't wanna side with Donald Trump,"
54:37;54:39;"but we also don't wanna side with the Illuminati."
54:39;54:42;"So this is a head scratcher."
54:42;54:44;"And you know we're not gonna just go eat apples."
54:44;54:45;"Well, thanks for calling in Jake."
54:45;54:48;"And thanks again, was it James from Dallas?"
54:48;54:49;"- Yeah, yeah."
54:49;54:50;"- James from the Big D."
54:50;54:52;"- Love getting a listener email."
54:52;54:57;"Anybody who has any interesting facts or insider info"
54:57;55:00;"on any of the major junk food brands,"
55:00;55:04;"if you can track down one of our emails,"
55:04;55:06;"please let us know, we'd appreciate it."
55:06;55:09;"All right, Jake, we'll see you back out in California."
55:09;55:10;"- All right, bro."
55:10;55:11;"- Have a good one."
55:11;55:13;"- Take care, guys."
55:13;55:15;"- Bye, Jake. - Take it easy."

58:23;58:24;"She listened to the show."
58:24;58:26;"She tweeted us the other week,"

58:42;58:43;"You know what's hot?"
58:43;58:44;"- I feel like I've been out of the loop"
58:44;58:46;"for like the last month."
58:46;58:47;"- Really?"
58:47;58:49;"- I mean, besides the big albums,"
58:49;58:52;"heard Frank Ocean, heard like Drake."
58:52;58:54;"I don't know, I feel like there's been like three"
58:54;58:56;"or four weeks without some huge album drop"
58:56;58:57;"between those two."
58:57;59:00;"- So you're just keeping up on the big albums."
59:00;59:01;"And what do you listen to in between?"
59:01;59:04;"You just up there at a B&B listening to Van Morrison?"
59:04;59:05;"- Yeah, mostly."
59:05;59:06;"- Disgusting."
59:06;59:07;"- And chain smokers."
59:07;59:09;"- It's important to listen to new music."
59:09;59:10;"What about you, Alec?"
59:10;59:12;"I know Alec's always up on the new pop music."
59:12;59:13;"- I'm up on everything."
59:13;59:14;"I know what's going on."
59:14;59:19;"- All right, well, number five song."
59:19;59:21;"- Let's see, maybe I'll know it."

59:30;59:32;"- It's probably ""We Don't Talk Anymore."""
59:32;59:33;"- All right, okay, but what do you think"
59:33;59:34;"the name of the song is?"
59:34;59:35;"- ""We Don't Talk Anymore."" - ""We Don't Talk Anymore."""
59:35;59:37;"- Nope. - All right."
59:37;59:38;"- It's called ""Hodrak Sunrise."""
59:38;59:39;"(laughing)"

59:42;59:44;"- Wait, is this chain smokers?"

59:47;59:49;"They're not folk music, they're dance music."

01:02:32;01:02:34;"I was gonna be like the Bieber girl,"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"but that's mean, you know?"
01:02:36;01:02:37;"- Oh yeah, you almost got knocked out."
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Wait, weren't you--"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"- I did not almost get knocked out by Justin Bieber."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"- You almost got knocked out by Justin Bieber"
01:02:42;01:02:43;"'cause you talked to Selena Gomez."
01:02:43;01:02:45;"- He was beefing, but"
01:02:46;01:02:47;"there was no almost knocked out."
01:02:47;01:02:48;"- He tried to fish hook you."
01:02:48;01:02:50;"- He tried to fish hook me, you miss."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"Nah, it wasn't that serious."
01:02:52;01:02:55;"♪ We don't talk anymore ♪"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"♪ What was all of it for ♪"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"♪ We don't talk anymore ♪"
01:02:59;01:03:02;"- If Justin Bieber fish hooked you, would you retaliate?"
01:03:02;01:03:02;"- Yeah, but I--"
01:03:02;01:03:03;"- Even when he's surrounded by his goons?"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"- Well, that's the thing,"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"is I would've retaliated that time,"
01:03:06;01:03:09;"but like I would've gone beaten half to death"
01:03:09;01:03:12;"by these giant guys."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"- You don't wanna die for a Justin Bieber fish hook."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"- I wouldn't die."
01:03:15;01:03:18;"- There's no way his bodyguards are gonna kill anybody."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"That's way too much trouble."
01:03:19;01:03:21;"- I don't know."
01:03:21;01:03:22;"- They're not gonna kill someone"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"unless they're threatening Justin Bieber's life."
01:03:24;01:03:27;"- They're not gonna kill you with a gun, but they might--"
01:03:27;01:03:29;"- I don't think I'm accidentally getting killed."
01:03:29;01:03:31;"Bodyguards like that, man, they're pro, you know?"
01:03:31;01:03:33;"They're not gonna kill me by accident."
01:03:33;01:03:33;"- I hope so."
01:03:33;01:03:35;"Justin Bieber, if you and any of your bodyguards"
01:03:35;01:03:38;"are listening, just don't kill anybody."
01:03:38;01:03:40;"You got enough violence in the world."
01:03:40;01:03:42;"- They may like disappear you, though."
01:03:42;01:03:43;"- That's true."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"They may rendition you."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"(laughing)"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"- You've been renditioned to the Calabasas?"
01:03:48;01:03:49;"- That's fine."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"- Okay, so that was Charlie Puth number five"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"with We Don't Talk Anymore, featuring who?"
01:03:53;01:03:54;"- Selena Gomez."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"- I can't believe I have to educate you guys"
01:03:56;01:03:57;"about stuff so basic."
01:03:57;01:03:58;"- I didn't know she fit, I don't know."
01:03:58;01:04:01;"I'm surprised that she would feature on some other guy's song."
01:04:01;01:04:03;"- 'Cause I'm a what?"
01:04:03;01:04:06;"- You're basic, so you have to educate us about basics."
01:04:06;01:04:07;"- You're basic."
01:04:07;01:04:08;"I took seven Ubers today."
01:04:08;01:04:09;"- Are you even a VIP?"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"- Yes, I'm a VIP."
01:04:11;01:04:12;"(laughing)"
01:04:12;01:04:13;"I took seven--"
01:04:13;01:04:14;"- Did you get invited to Juno?"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"Do you have a rapport with your drivers?"
01:04:16;01:04:16;"Do they invite you to Juno?"
01:04:16;01:04:18;"- I got invited to Juno."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"- Yeah, me too."
01:04:19;01:04:20;"- No big deal."
01:04:20;01:04:21;"- I know what Juno is."
01:04:21;01:04:23;"(laughing)"
01:04:23;01:04:24;"And I haven't been invited."
01:04:24;01:04:25;"- You know what, Ezra?"
01:04:25;01:04:29;"I got invited to Juno in an Uber with you."
01:04:29;01:04:30;"- Really?"
01:04:30;01:04:30;"- Yup."
01:04:30;01:04:31;"I was in the front seat."
01:04:31;01:04:34;"- What does Uber have to do with the Canadian Grammys?"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"- The other day I got in an Uber and my driver was like,"
01:04:36;01:04:38;"""Man, you have a really good rating."
01:04:38;01:04:39;"""Did you know that?"""
01:04:39;01:04:41;"And I was like, ""Yeah, of course."""
01:04:41;01:04:44;"- Well, anyway, today I took 12 Ubers."
01:04:44;01:04:46;"So I heard so much pop music"
01:04:46;01:04:47;"that that's why I know what the song is."
01:04:47;01:04:50;"And actually, today was kind of a slow day for me."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"I'm trying to get down to one pack of Ubers."
01:04:52;01:04:55;"- Well, I have a car that I drive that's really nice."
01:04:55;01:04:59;"So, you know, I only take Ubers if I'm being lazy."
01:04:59;01:05:01;"Otherwise, I drive my very nice car."
01:05:01;01:05:06;"- Well, I don't drive German cars 'cause of the Holocaust."
01:05:06;01:05:07;"So."
01:05:07;01:05:08;"- Yeah."
01:05:08;01:05:08;"- Fair enough."
01:05:08;01:05:13;"- Well, I do drive German cars, not because of the Holocaust."
01:05:14;01:05:16;"Shout out to German cars."
01:05:16;01:05:17;"It's time to heal."
01:05:17;01:05:20;"The number four song on the countdown."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"I don't want to play the guessing game anymore."
01:05:22;01:05:23;"I just want to tell you guys what it is."
01:05:23;01:05:25;"It's Major Lazer."
01:05:25;01:05:27;"That's a group out of Calabasas"
01:05:27;01:05:31;"featuring Justin Bieber and Cold Water."
01:05:31;01:05:37;"Fun fact, this song was written by Ed Sheeran."
01:05:37;01:05:39;"- Really?"
01:05:39;01:05:40;"- Yeah."
01:05:40;01:05:41;"- Then why didn't he sing it?"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"Feels like a no brainer for him."
01:05:43;01:05:46;"- Okay, well, Ed Sheeran doesn't have time"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"to be singing all of these songs."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"When you're somebody of the caliber of Ed Sheeran,"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"he's got an embarrassment of riches."
01:05:52;01:05:55;"- I don't know."
01:05:55;01:05:57;"I think he could have used some Major Lazer"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"song of the summer cred."
01:05:59;01:06:00;"- No, Ed Sheeran's got his own flavor."
01:06:00;01:06:03;"- What do Ed Sheeran fans call themselves?"
01:06:03;01:06:08;"Is there like a Navy or Swifties kind of thing?"
01:06:08;01:06:09;"- Oh, there must be."
01:06:09;01:06:09;"- Do guys have that?"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"Maybe they don't have that."
01:06:13;01:06:14;"- Sure they do."
01:06:14;01:06:15;"- Yeah, Bieber, Beliebers."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"- Oh, Beliebers."
01:06:16;01:06:17;"- Yeah."
01:06:17;01:06:18;"- True."
01:06:18;01:06:19;"- I don't know."
01:06:19;01:06:21;"- You're being real divisive with the"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"men and women stuff today, Asher."
01:06:23;01:06:25;"- That's true."
01:06:25;01:06:26;"- Sorry, I don't want,"
01:06:26;01:06:27;"there's a guy trying to hit anybody."
01:06:27;01:06:29;"- You guys have that thing that girls have?"
01:06:29;01:06:35;"- So, do you guys like this one?"
01:06:35;01:06:36;"You've heard this one."
01:06:36;01:06:37;"- Yeah."
01:06:37;01:06:39;"- It's okay, I like the other Major Lazer songs"
01:06:39;01:06:40;"more than this one, I think."
01:06:40;01:06:42;"It feels like a leftover from last summer."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"- Tropical, tropical rhythm, kind of."
01:06:44;01:06:45;"- It's dancehall."
01:06:45;01:06:46;"- Yeah."
01:06:46;01:06:49;"- Yeah, it just feels like so similar to those,"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"all their hits from last year,"
01:06:51;01:06:55;"that, kind of unnecessary."

01:07:28;01:07:31;"So, you know, we've been talking for almost a year now"
01:07:31;01:07:33;"on this show, when we get together"
01:07:33;01:07:36;"and discuss the currents of pop culture."
01:07:36;01:07:37;"Justin Bieber, over the past couple years,"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"became the new king of dancehall."
01:07:39;01:07:40;"- Sure. - Yeah."
01:07:40;01:07:44;"- He, Diplo, Muh, all these guys are the new"
01:07:44;01:07:47;"pirates of the Caribbean."
01:07:47;01:07:53;"And we had Deezus on,"
01:07:53;01:07:56;"our only guest of Jamaican descent was Deezus"
01:07:56;01:07:58;"on, I think, the first Time Crisis."
01:07:58;01:08:01;"And he talked about being in a Jamaican barber shop"
01:08:01;01:08:05;"and everybody liked that first Justin dancehall song."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"They were kind of shocked to realize that it was Justin."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"- Sorry? - Yeah, I think sorry,"
01:08:08;01:08:09;"everybody liked the song."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"- Sorry's a great song."
01:08:10;01:08:13;"- Yeah, that's, can't really hate that."
01:08:13;01:08:18;"- But not all Jamaicans are happy about Diplo"
01:08:18;01:08:21;"and Bieber and Muh becoming the new pirates of the Caribbean."
01:08:21;01:08:24;"And Sean Paul said that Drake and Justin Bieber"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"don't credit where dancehall came from."
01:08:26;01:08:29;"And so Sean Paul did an interview and he said,"
01:08:29;01:08:31;"""I know artists back in Jamaica that don't like Major Lazer"
01:08:31;01:08:32;"""because they think they do the same thing"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"""that Drake and Kanye did."
01:08:34;01:08:36;"""They take and take and don't credit."""
01:08:36;01:08:38;"- Can I interrupt this for one second"
01:08:38;01:08:41;"and tell you what Ed Sheeran fans are called?"
01:08:41;01:08:42;"- Oh yes, please."
01:08:42;01:08:43;"- You're really gonna like this."
01:08:43;01:08:44;"- What?"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"- They're called Cheerios."
01:08:46;01:08:48;"- Oh, that's really good."
01:08:48;01:08:50;"- That's really good."
01:08:50;01:08:53;"It's like a little fancy British,"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"like almost like a Cockney thing."
01:08:55;01:08:56;"- Cheerio?"
01:08:56;01:08:58;"- Cheerio."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"- So what's a honey nut Cheerio?"
01:08:59;01:09:02;"(laughing)"
01:09:02;01:09:03;"- Hmm, I don't know."
01:09:03;01:09:06;"- A honey nut Cheerio is when you're such a big Cheerio"
01:09:06;01:09:07;"that you're sweet."
01:09:07;01:09:08;"- You stick to other Cheerios."
01:09:08;01:09:09;"- But you also make it a little nutty."
01:09:09;01:09:13;"That's a high level, a high ranking Cheerio official"
01:09:13;01:09:14;"because you're a honey nuts for your Ed."
01:09:14;01:09:17;"- Maybe like a Beyonce, Ed Sheeran crossover."
01:09:17;01:09:20;"- Wait, what about Beyonce?"
01:09:20;01:09:21;"- 'Cause of the beehive."
01:09:21;01:09:28;"The honey, you know, honey nut Cheerios has the bee mascot."
01:09:28;01:09:28;"- Oh right."
01:09:28;01:09:30;"- Don't look at me like I'm crazy."
01:09:30;01:09:31;"- No, you're right."
01:09:31;01:09:34;"I don't, I take 15 Ubers a day."
01:09:34;01:09:35;"(laughing)"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"I just wanna put that out there."
01:09:37;01:09:40;"I also wanna point out, these are Uber SUVs."
01:09:40;01:09:41;"- Is the music different?"
01:09:41;01:09:44;"- Black SUVs or just SUVs?"
01:09:44;01:09:45;"Yeah, I mean I know the answer."
01:09:45;01:09:46;"- Which one is more expensive?"
01:09:46;01:09:47;"- I know the answer."
01:09:47;01:09:48;"- Black SUVs."
01:09:48;01:09:49;"- Yeah, right."
01:09:49;01:09:49;"- That's right."
01:09:49;01:09:51;"- There would be no pause if they were black SUVs."
01:09:51;01:09:54;"You would have been like, what you think man?"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"I'm in those, you know, Suburban's."
01:09:56;01:09:59;"- I take 15 black Uber SUVs a day."
01:09:59;01:10:00;"- Yeah."
01:10:00;01:10:05;"- You take one to two white Uber X's."
01:10:05;01:10:06;"- Why are they white?"
01:10:06;01:10:07;"You can't pick that."
01:10:07;01:10:10;"(laughing)"
01:10:10;01:10:11;"Dirty white ones."
01:10:11;01:10:13;"The number three song is 21 Pilots"
01:10:13;01:10:15;"from Suicide Squad, the album."
01:10:15;01:10:17;"Do you guys know 21 Pilots?"
01:10:17;01:10:17;"- Yeah."
01:10:17;01:10:18;"(laughing)"
01:10:18;01:10:19;"- Yeah."
01:10:19;01:10:22;"- That's the guy with the tattoos all over his neck, right?"
01:10:22;01:10:22;"- Is he tatted up?"
01:10:22;01:10:23;"- Yeah, I think so."
01:10:23;01:10:25;"If it's who I'm thinking of."
01:10:25;01:10:26;"- What do they sound like?"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"♪ All my friends are heathens ♪"
01:10:31;01:10:32;"♪ Take it slow ♪"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"- Yeah, tattoo guy."
01:10:34;01:10:38;"♪ Wait for them to ask you who you know ♪"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"- These guys blew up like quick."
01:10:40;01:10:41;"- Yeah."
01:10:41;01:10:42;"- Biggest band in America."
01:10:42;01:10:44;"- They've had a lot of hits in a row."
01:10:44;01:10:45;"- They are really trash."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"We gotta drop a bomb right there."
01:10:49;01:10:50;"(explosion)"
01:10:50;01:10:53;"I can't believe that I'm out here"
01:10:53;01:10:56;"defending 21 Pilots on two coasts."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"But last time on Tom Crisis,"
01:10:57;01:10:59;"Jake said he didn't like 21 Pilots"
01:10:59;01:11:00;"and now Despot doesn't like 21 Pilots."
01:11:00;01:11:04;"- It's like even worse, Linkin Park and Crazy Town."
01:11:04;01:11:06;"- It is weird that it's like the one"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"kind of hold out, it sounds like Fallout Boy"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"or something like that a little bit."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"Like somehow that sneaked through the cracks"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"even though the sound of everything else is different."
01:11:14;01:11:16;"It's all like Dancehall and trap and stuff."
01:11:16;01:11:19;"Like that still carries over."
01:11:19;01:11:21;"- Alien Ant Farm."
01:11:21;01:11:22;"- Alien Ant Farm is good."
01:11:22;01:11:27;"Well first of all, Linkin Park,"
01:11:27;01:11:30;"they're not like Linkin Park, they're more intellectual."
01:11:30;01:11:31;"- Oh really?"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"- Listen to the lyrics."
01:11:32;01:11:33;"- Okay."
01:11:33;01:11:36;"- Isn't 21 Pilots a literary reference?"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"- Think so."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"- I think it is."
01:11:39;01:11:41;"Actually, they originally called 21 Ubers"
01:11:41;01:11:44;"based on the average number of Ubers that I take a day."
01:11:44;01:11:46;"- But then all their Ubers were Honda Pilots"
01:11:46;01:11:49;"so they were like, let's go 21 Pilots."
01:11:49;01:11:50;"- Exactly."
01:11:50;01:11:53;"So you know, I always had that special connection with them."

01:12:24;01:12:25;"- I was kind of excited about it"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"when I saw the trailer a long time ago."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"I heard a crazy thing actually,"
01:12:28;01:12:31;"that the trailer was so different from the movie"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"and people respond so well to the trailer"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"that they got the trailer company"
01:12:35;01:12:38;"to make their own edit of the movie."
01:12:38;01:12:40;"And the director freaked out"
01:12:40;01:12:42;"so then they just combined the two movies,"
01:12:42;01:12:45;"the two edits and just came up with like garbage"
01:12:45;01:12:46;"that everybody hated."
01:12:46;01:12:47;"- Oh no."
01:12:47;01:12:49;"- It sounds like some typical Hollywood stuff but."
01:12:49;01:12:50;"- I was gonna see it,"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"but then I read that it was really twisted."
01:12:52;01:12:56;"- What, you mean like the clown bit?"
01:12:56;01:12:57;"- Club wise or?"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"- I saw a quote somewhere that just said"
01:12:59;01:13:01;"this movie is wild and twisted."
01:13:01;01:13:02;"And I was like oh,"
01:13:02;01:13:05;"maybe I don't need to see that."
01:13:05;01:13:06;"I love comic books,"
01:13:06;01:13:09;"I love Will Smith,"
01:13:09;01:13:09;"all that stuff but then,"
01:13:09;01:13:11;"so I was like getting ready to go see it,"
01:13:11;01:13:12;"I was gonna bring the whole family"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"and then I just like pulled out this review"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"and one of my sons."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"(laughing)"
01:13:18;01:13:21;"One of my sons showed me the newspaper and said,"
01:13:21;01:13:24;"daddy are you really taking us to see a twisted joyride?"
01:13:24;01:13:28;"And I was like, no."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"- Which son of yours said that?"
01:13:30;01:13:31;"- Oh Kenneth."
01:13:31;01:13:35;"We were in the Uber SUV and everything."
01:13:35;01:13:37;"- What model of car was it?"
01:13:37;01:13:38;"- Chevy Tahoe."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"- Nope."
01:13:40;01:13:41;"- What do you mean no?"
01:13:41;01:13:41;"- No."
01:13:41;01:13:42;"- What do you mean no?"
01:13:42;01:13:43;"- Would have been a Suburban or Escalade,"
01:13:43;01:13:45;"I don't think it'd be a Tahoe."
01:13:45;01:13:46;"- It's often a Tahoe."
01:13:46;01:13:49;"- All right."
01:13:49;01:13:51;"- Okay, well I guess I also didn't remind you that."
01:13:51;01:13:52;"- That's a Uber X SUV I have."
01:13:52;01:13:55;"- The Lord is testing me today."
01:13:55;01:13:57;"But also we were out in Connecticut."
01:13:57;01:13:59;"- I'm flattered you called me the Lord."
01:13:59;01:14:05;"- Anyway, I don't go see twisted movies."
01:14:05;01:14:10;"The number two song on the charts is Sia, remember her?"
01:14:10;01:14:11;"- Yeah."
01:14:11;01:14:12;"- Well she's back."
01:14:12;01:14:14;"And this song is featuring Kendrick Lamar."
01:14:14;01:14:15;"It's called The Greatest."
01:14:15;01:14:16;"I don't think I've heard this one yet."
01:14:16;01:14:17;"- I do."
01:14:17;01:14:19;"- I heard it."
01:14:19;01:14:20;"- No you didn't."
01:14:20;01:14:21;"- I heard it."
01:14:21;01:14:21;"- I did hear it."

01:16:04;01:16:07;"Should we listen to the Kendrick verse?"
01:16:07;01:16:08;"Yeah."
01:16:08;01:16:09;"Alright."
01:16:09;01:16:13;"Because we actually, there hasn't been much rapping so far aside from 21 Pilots."
01:16:13;01:16:15;"If you want to call that rapping."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"Yes."
01:16:16;01:16:20;"Ay, I am the truth, ay, I am the wisdom of the fallen"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"I'm the youth, ay, I am the greatest, ay"
01:16:22;01:16:25;"This is the proof, ay, I work hard, pray hard, pay dues"
01:16:25;01:16:28;"Ay, I transform with pressure, I'm hands on whatever"
01:16:28;01:16:31;"I fell twice before, my bounce back was special"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"Let downs forget you, and the critics attest you"
01:16:33;01:16:36;"But the strongest survive, another scar may bless you"
01:16:36;01:16:37;"I don't give up"
01:16:37;01:16:41;"I think so far he's rapping about being a diamond."
01:16:41;01:16:42;"Nah."
01:16:42;01:16:43;"About being the greatest."
01:16:43;01:16:45;"You said he transforms under pressure."
01:16:45;01:16:53;"I think initially they sent him the beat for ""We're Beautiful Like Diamonds in the Sky."""
01:16:53;01:16:54;"Yeah, and he wrote the verse."
01:16:54;01:16:55;"He wrote the verse."
01:16:55;01:16:56;"And they were like, ""Nah, I don't think so, Kendrick."""
01:16:56;01:16:59;"And then he was like, ""That's fine, it's about something else."""
01:16:59;01:17:02;"I mean, you're right, Kendrick, I never thought of Kendrick as being a literal rapper."
01:17:02;01:17:03;"Pretty straightforward."
01:17:03;01:17:04;"Well, I mean, he uses exaggeration."
01:17:04;01:17:09;"For example, when he's like, ""I saw this guy who was named this shoot this guy at this"
01:17:09;01:17:13;"place,"" but they had to bleep it out because it's like, ""Come on, man."""
01:17:13;01:17:16;"What are you doing?"
01:17:16;01:17:20;"And then he backtracks and says, ""Not saying that he did it."""
01:17:20;01:17:22;"I saw this guy fish hook that guy."
01:17:22;01:17:23;"Exactly."
01:17:23;01:17:24;"And then get slapped."
01:17:24;01:17:25;"Yeah."
01:17:25;01:17:29;"I'm not saying that literally happened, but although Kendrick also, you know."
01:17:29;01:17:31;"I like Kendrick, he's a great rapper, don't get me wrong."
01:17:31;01:17:36;"Right, but I'm saying like some of his famous lines, ""I pray my d*** get big as Eiffel"
01:17:36;01:17:37;"Tower."""
01:17:37;01:17:39;"That's metaphor, yeah."
01:17:39;01:17:40;"That's metaphor."
01:17:40;01:17:42;"Well, simile, I guess, because, right?"
01:17:42;01:17:43;"Simile is a type of metaphor."
01:17:43;01:17:44;"That's my personal belief."
01:17:44;01:17:45;"That's true."
01:17:46;01:17:47;"Actually, I got an argument about that recently."
01:17:47;01:17:48;"It's true."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"In an Uber."
01:17:49;01:17:50;"I think you're right."
01:17:50;01:17:51;"Okay."
01:17:51;01:17:52;"My dad was an English teacher."
01:17:52;01:17:53;"Oh, yeah."
01:17:53;01:17:55;"So I'm a stickler for that type of stuff."
01:17:55;01:17:57;"It's a gorgeous language."
01:17:57;01:17:59;"Thank you."
01:17:59;01:18:05;"Thank you to your father for inventing it."
01:18:05;01:18:09;"So far, every song that we've listened to has been vaguely tropical."
01:18:09;01:18:12;"The Pirates of the Caribbean are back."
01:18:12;01:18:15;"They left Johnny Depp in the Caribbean, but they came back."
01:18:15;01:18:16;"Yeah."
01:18:16;01:18:19;"Are you ready for the number one song on iTunes?"
01:18:19;01:18:22;"This is a big, big hit."
01:18:22;01:18:23;"I'm ready."
01:18:23;01:18:27;"And if you can't name the artist who made this song within the first three seconds,"
01:18:27;01:18:33;"I question whether you've ever been in an Uber in your life."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"Okay."
01:18:35;01:18:37;"Madonna."
01:18:37;01:18:44;"Oh, you know, I was so ready for it to be one dance that..."
01:18:44;01:18:45;"All right."
01:18:45;01:18:46;"Three seconds wasn't fair."
01:18:46;01:18:47;"I'll give you ten seconds."
01:18:47;01:18:48;"Listen to those wind chimes."
01:18:48;01:18:49;"I don't even know who this is."
01:18:49;01:18:50;"I don't know who this is."
01:20:33;01:20:34;"I..."
01:20:34;01:20:37;"Honestly, I've been in many Ubers."
01:20:37;01:20:41;"Bet you never heard the song ""Uber Everywhere"" until Travis remixed it."
01:20:41;01:20:42;"Until Travis remixed it."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"That's when I heard it."
01:20:43;01:20:44;"Travis who?"
01:20:44;01:20:45;"Travis Tritt?"
01:20:45;01:20:46;"I don't even know what you're talking about."
01:20:46;01:20:50;"I only listened to the original version of ""Uber Everywhere."""
01:20:50;01:20:51;"Why?"
01:20:51;01:20:53;"Made in Tokyo."
01:20:53;01:20:57;"Did Travis hop on that?"
01:20:57;01:21:00;"Did Travis hop on that?"
01:21:00;01:21:01;"He made it."
01:21:01;01:21:02;"He made it a radio hit."
01:21:02;01:21:03;"Really?"
01:21:03;01:21:04;"He made ""Made in Tokyo"" famous."
01:21:04;01:21:05;"What?"
01:21:05;01:21:06;"He did."

01:22:01;01:22:20;"We ain't ever getting older, we ain't ever getting older."
01:22:20;01:22:32;"Anyway, so the Chainsmokers are two guys, yeah man I don't know anything about the Chainsmokers, all I know is that they are killing it. They started out, their first
singles were kind of seeming more like novelty singles, like they had the one that went ""First, let me take a selfie."" Right, right, right."
01:22:32;01:22:46;"Kind of seemed like a jokey song. That's Kanye. And then they had a song called Kanye. And then next thing you know they got Rose. You know who had a better song called
Kanye? Famous Dex. Oh, I thought you were going to say Young Thug. No, Famous Dex. Who's like coming up right now?"
01:22:46;01:23:04;"They also had the big song Don't Let Me Down. Oh yeah. Don't let me down. I was ready for that to be the number one song. That's how far away I am. Beatles. What are you
talking about Alec? It's the girls singing, it's not girls and the Beatles. You're right. Wait, well how do you know? Don't let me down. There's no drop in the Beatles."
01:23:04;01:23:30;"The Chainsmokers are the biggest hit makers of 2016. You understand what I'm saying? Yeah. Yes. So, act like you know. I do know. And Halsey. I guessed it, hey I guessed
it. I like Halsey, she's from New Jersey. Alright. Well you got something against New Jersey? No. Where in New Jersey is she from? I don't know, I assume northern New
Jersey. Okay. I don't know that much about New Jersey. I have nothing against it, I really like The Sopranos."
01:23:30;01:23:54;"Great show. Oh, you know a fun fact? No. On Memorial Day I met Dr. Melfi. She hot? She's a beautiful woman. And she's a real legend because you know sometimes people on
iconic TV shows, you only associate them with that role. Sure. You would never say one hit wonder with something like that but it's like you're so associated with one
role. Yeah, you get pigeonholed."
01:23:54;01:24:14;"But she has two iconic roles. Dr. Melfi on The Sopranos and Goodfellas. Oh yeah. Wake Up Henry. She's a legend. Shout out to Lorraine Bracco. Yeah, that's her name. Edie
Falco went to my alma mater. She went to Halsey High? SUNY Purchase."
01:24:14;01:24:38;"So anyway guys, I feel like this was a very all over the place top five but all five songs were excellent but which is your favorite? I forgot already. Okay,
Chainsmokers. I guess Major Lazer. Yeah, that's the one. But I don't know. You guys are such hipsters, man."
01:24:38;01:25:00;"What was your favorite? Charlie Puth? It was for me. It's a five way tie. I'll tell you what, man. I truly like all five of those songs but it would really depend. Like for
instance, say I was going to play in my weekend hockey league and I want to get pumped up and I'm taking an Uber SUV, I would probably ask the driver to play Heathens by 21
Pilots."
01:25:00;01:25:29;"If it's like the morning and maybe I'm on my way to like a meeting or something and I want to just kind of like relax or something, I might put on the Chainsmokers. Let's say
I'm in an Uber SUV going to a party and maybe I see something out the window that triggers a kind of Proustian moment, a wave of nostalgia. I might listen to Charlie Puth,
We Don't Talk Anymore. You know, it's like it's all different. Okay. So thanks for counting on the top five songs with me, guys."
01:25:29;01:25:32;"Yeah, it was educational. Let's listen to some more music."
01:25:32;01:25:34;"Desperado"

01:25:53;01:25:57;"You need me there ain't no leaving me behind"
01:25:57;01:26:00;"Never, no, no, just want out of here, yeah"
01:26:00;01:26:02;"'Cause I'm gone and you're going back"
01:26:02;01:26:07;"If you want, we could be either runaway or running from"
01:26:07;01:26:10;"In this head of love, yeah, yeah"
01:26:10;01:26:13;"There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing here for me"
01:26:13;01:26:16;"There ain't nothing here for me anymore"

01:26:30;01:26:32;"We both had our hearts broken"
01:26:32;01:26:34;"Take it easy"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"I'm not trying to go against you"
01:26:36;01:26:38;"I could be an old picture"
01:26:38;01:26:42;"Gotta get up outta here and you ain't leaving me behind"
01:26:42;01:26:45;"I know you won't 'cause we share common interests"
01:26:45;01:26:50;"You need me there ain't no leaving me behind"
01:26:50;01:26:53;"Never, no, no, just want out of here, yeah"
01:26:53;01:26:56;"'Cause I'm gone and you're going back"
01:26:56;01:27:01;"If you want, we could be either runaway or running from"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"In this head of love, yeah, yeah"
01:27:03;01:27:07;"There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing here for me"
01:27:07;01:27:10;"There ain't nothing here for me anymore"
01:27:10;01:27:13;"But I don't wanna be alone"
01:27:13;01:27:16;"Desperado"
01:27:16;01:27:20;"Yeah, I don't wanna be alone"
01:27:20;01:27:24;"Desperado"
01:27:25;01:27:28;"Yeah, I don't wanna be alone"
01:27:28;01:27:47;"If you want, we could be either runaway or running from"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"In this head of love, yeah, yeah"
01:27:49;01:27:53;"There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing here for me"
01:27:53;01:27:56;"There ain't nothing here for me anymore"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"But I don't wanna be alone"
01:27:58;01:28:02;"If you want, we could be either runaway or running from"
01:28:02;01:28:04;"In this head of love, yeah, yeah"
01:28:04;01:28:08;"There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing here for me"
01:28:08;01:28:11;"There ain't nothing here for me anymore"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"But I don't wanna be alone"
01:28:13;01:28:18;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
01:28:18;01:28:24;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"Hey, hey"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"We just talking about practice"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"We sitting here, I supposed to be a franchise player"
01:28:31;01:28:34;"And we in here talking about practice"
01:28:34;01:28:37;"I mean, listen, we talking about practice"
01:28:37;01:28:40;"Not a game, not a game, not a game"
01:28:40;01:28:43;"We talking about practice"
01:28:43;01:28:49;"Not a game, not a, not, not the game that I go out there and die for"
01:28:49;01:28:51;"I heard you can't teach"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"Well, forget I guess class dismissed"
01:28:53;01:28:54;"I can't teach you, ish"
01:28:54;01:28:57;"I've been doing this for years, man, my rep is legit"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"It's like a mic is a cancer stick"
01:28:59;01:29:02;"I can't quit, but I can kick that measurement stick, stick"
01:29:02;01:29:05;"To let you know real quick whether you can or can't spit"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"And from the sound of it, you on the stage"
01:29:07;01:29:10;"It's like a square on a triangle, hold it, don't fit"
01:29:10;01:29:12;"I mean, the whole way you trying to hold the mic"
01:29:12;01:29:14;"I ain't trying to be a smart aleck"
01:29:14;01:29:16;"But you sound like a hit, it shouldn't be so phallic"
01:29:16;01:29:19;"You wanna be hard, but you can't come correct"
01:29:19;01:29:22;"I'd have showed you how it's done if you showed some respect"
01:29:22;01:29:25;"Instead, what you doing is showing you newness"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"Why you pursuing the skill trade?"
01:29:27;01:29:30;"You trying to get paid and laid before the groupies in the guap"
01:29:30;01:29:33;"Man, the fact is, it takes practice"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"We talking about practice"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"I mean, listen, we talking about practice"
01:29:37;01:29:40;"Not a game, not a game, not a game"
01:29:40;01:29:43;"We talking about practice"
01:29:43;01:29:46;"And we talking about practice"
01:29:46;01:29:49;"Not a game, not a game, not a game"
01:29:49;01:29:52;"We talking about practice, man"
01:29:52;01:29:56;"Time Crisis with Ezra King"
01:29:56;01:30:00;"Beats 1"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"Fashion, turn to the left"
01:30:02;01:30:04;"Fashion, turn to the right"
01:30:04;01:30:12;"Fashion, we are the Goon Squad and we're coming to town"
01:30:12;01:30:18;"We are now joined in the studio by fashion expert Mr. Mort, a.k.a. Mordecai Rubenstein"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"Welcome back to the show"
01:30:20;01:30:22;"Good to have you here, Mordecai"
01:30:22;01:30:24;"Oh, so nice to be here, this is the after party"
01:30:24;01:30:28;"We're very glad to have you because it's been Fashion Week in New York"
01:30:28;01:30:32;"And we're trying to educate ourselves and our listeners more about fashion"
01:30:32;01:30:35;"Have you been enjoying New York Fashion Week? You've been going to a lot of shows?"
01:30:35;01:30:37;"I have been enjoying myself immensely"
01:30:37;01:30:41;"Normally I'm a little bit holdoffish, standoffish"
01:30:41;01:30:43;"I don't like to go, I'm on the outside"
01:30:43;01:30:47;"I actually went into some shows and presentations because I didn't want to be outside"
01:30:47;01:30:49;"I'm glad I went inside"
01:30:49;01:30:51;"Because this is a music show first and foremost"
01:30:51;01:30:54;"Well, it's culture, it's music, fashion, a little bit of finance"
01:30:54;01:30:58;"But it's primarily a music show so we have to talk about the Kanye Show"
01:30:58;01:31:00;"So you went to the Kanye Show last week, huh?"
01:31:00;01:31:07;"I went to the Kanye Show, took the tram from New York City over to Roosevelt Island"
01:31:07;01:31:12;"Where Main Street's got the fish shop, the thrift shop, the candy shop, the pet shop"
01:31:12;01:31:13;"Nail shop"
01:31:13;01:31:17;"What was the tram situation like going to that show?"
01:31:17;01:31:20;"I went early like a blogger, so it was empty"
01:31:20;01:31:24;"And it was a lot of kill me now once I got outside"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"But it was really peaceful"
01:31:26;01:31:31;"On the way back there's a tennis academy or a tennis school or camp right next to the tram"
01:31:31;01:31:36;"And they got all the little rich kids on their way back to the city holding the tennis rackets"
01:31:36;01:31:40;"And the nanny taking them all at the same time in a smooth swoop"
01:31:40;01:31:41;"I'll hold those for you"
01:31:41;01:31:44;"I bet some of those little rich kids who just took their tennis lessons"
01:31:44;01:31:48;"They probably with their nanny saw these hypebeasts walking past"
01:31:48;01:31:50;"And I bet some of those kids were like"
01:31:50;01:31:53;"I don't want to be a tennis player, I want to be a hypebeast"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"And you know like when you're 11, 12 you see a hypebeast"
01:31:55;01:31:58;"That could change your whole perspective on what you want to be"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"Unfortunately, because we're in New York"
01:32:00;01:32:04;"I see kids waiting on different streets in New York for autographs and they live here"
01:32:04;01:32:08;"And they took rides with their fathers from New Jersey and Long Island on their way into the city"
01:32:08;01:32:10;"Just to hang outside and get an autograph"
01:32:10;01:32:11;"An autograph from who?"
01:32:11;01:32:14;"Oh, whether it's Taylor Swift or Casey Neistat"
01:32:14;01:32:16;"They both need no mentions"
01:32:16;01:32:19;"But I see kids like waiting with their fathers town cars"
01:32:19;01:32:22;"They're 13 with a Yamaha outside the office in Lafayette"
01:32:22;01:32:24;"I'm like you came all the way from New Jersey for an autograph"
01:32:24;01:32:29;"But it was really cute to see the kids outside Kanye that live in Roosevelt Island"
01:32:29;01:32:31;"They were there with like their nanny skateboards"
01:32:31;01:32:35;"13 years old saying like that's an editor from French Folk"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"Telling the mom or the nanny like that's cute"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"I think that's cool you know"
01:32:39;01:32:40;"I don't know if they want to be a hypebeast"
01:32:40;01:32:43;"But they know that there's something happening in their backyard"
01:32:43;01:32:44;"That's kind of exciting"
01:32:44;01:32:45;"I'm sure it's very exciting"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"It's the biggest thing that happened on Roosevelt Island in a while"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"Some of them don't, yeah since like Hillary's speech"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"Some of them don't ever leave too I found out"
01:32:51;01:32:54;"But I just clicked on the New York Post on the subway over here"
01:32:54;01:32:57;"And it said something like that it was a show"
01:32:57;01:32:58;"Wait, but weren't you there?"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"I actually did not go inside the show"
01:33:00;01:33:03;"I went there, checked out the scene and left"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"So you were like one of those kids"
01:33:05;01:33:08;"Okay but I'm a music and finance expert"
01:33:08;01:33:09;"You're a fashion expert"
01:33:09;01:33:14;"So for me Kanye's fashion line I hear about it all the time"
01:33:14;01:33:17;"Because I'm a music expert and he's a musician"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"So I'm coming at it from that angle"
01:33:19;01:33:23;"Would musicians talk about Kanye's clothing like when you're taking to Schwitz and stuff?"
01:33:23;01:33:26;"Well I attend to Schwitz with the finance guys more"
01:33:26;01:33:27;"But yeah if I'm in the Schwitz with some musicians"
01:33:27;01:33:30;"If finance or music is talking about Kanye's clothing"
01:33:30;01:33:32;"That's a big red flag"
01:33:32;01:33:33;"Finance and music"
01:33:33;01:33:36;"Everybody talks about Kanye because he's an important artist"
01:33:36;01:33:40;"So my question that I pose to you as a fashion expert is"
01:33:40;01:33:43;"How is Kanye perceived in the fashion world?"
01:33:43;01:33:44;"Joke"
01:33:44;01:33:46;"Okay but if the editor from Fred Vogue came"
01:33:46;01:33:47;"They have to go"
01:33:47;01:33:50;"He blocked off a calendar for three hours"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"Didn't tell editors where the address is"
01:33:52;01:33:53;"Till last night"
01:33:53;01:33:56;"Chutzpah, rude, gumption"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"Get the f*ck out of the industry"
01:33:58;01:33:59;"This is America"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"What are you even saying right now?"
01:34:01;01:34:02;"I'm saying like let people know"
01:34:02;01:34:05;"They don't have to block off hours for you"
01:34:05;01:34:08;"Okay but isn't fashion all about attitude?"
01:34:08;01:34:09;"A little bit, a little bit"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"Like don't make them wait two hours"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"Wait them wait a half hour"
01:34:13;01:34:15;"Make them come from another borough"
01:34:15;01:34:16;"Start on time"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"John Galliano used to make people wait a couple hours"
01:34:18;01:34:19;"And look what happened to him"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"Kids don't even know who he is"
01:34:21;01:34:22;"What are you talking about?"
01:34:22;01:34:23;"He works at Margella"
01:34:24;01:34:26;"Please, kids get confused with Gautier Galliano"
01:34:26;01:34:27;"They don't know nothing"
01:34:27;01:34:30;"But if all these editors and stuff go to the Kanye show"
01:34:30;01:34:31;"They have to"
01:34:31;01:34:34;"Okay but surely he must be building a reputation"
01:34:34;01:34:35;"Slowly but surely"
01:34:35;01:34:36;"Yeah this is true"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"Yeah but he's just using his cachet"
01:34:38;01:34:41;"As one of the biggest musicians in the world"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"To be like I'm a ripped up hoodie"
01:34:43;01:34:44;"Exactly"
01:34:44;01:34:45;"And you're a designer, not a musician"
01:34:45;01:34:48;"You're a designer, you're staying up nights before the show"
01:34:48;01:34:49;"You don't have 45 Tommy Tons"
01:34:49;01:34:52;"And all these people that you pay or don't pay"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"To like consult for you"
01:34:54;01:34:57;"And then you go from a show to a show"
01:34:57;01:35:00;"Like you perform music tonight, fashion tomorrow"
01:35:00;01:35:02;"He's gonna do the ballet tomorrow night"
01:35:02;01:35:03;"It's called a renaissance man"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"Yeah but I would argue that he's like bringing"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"And I don't know, this could be for better or worse"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"But he's bringing like a whole other level of attention"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"To Fashion Week and the shows and stuff"
01:35:11;01:35:12;"Again, rude, rude"
01:35:12;01:35:13;"What do you mean it's rude?"
01:35:13;01:35:16;"Well it depends on the audience you're talking about"
01:35:16;01:35:19;"Yeah, Ralph Lauren, these companies can't afford"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"Or they don't want to put on a show for whatever reason"
01:35:21;01:35:23;"They're saving money, maybe they think it's newsy"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"To put models in a box on Madison Avenue"
01:35:25;01:35:26;"Which they're doing"
01:35:26;01:35:29;"But for this guy to take the show out of New York"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"Into Roosevelt Island"
01:35:31;01:35:32;"Don't you think"
01:35:32;01:35:34;"First of all, Roosevelt Island is technically part of New York City"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"No, isn't it technically not part of New York City?"
01:35:36;01:35:37;"No it is part of New York City"
01:35:37;01:35:40;"The subway goes there, you can legally go from there"
01:35:40;01:35:41;"There's no police, there's no jurisdiction"
01:35:41;01:35:42;"There's no taking an F train"
01:35:42;01:35:45;"No NYPD jurisdiction"
01:35:45;01:35:50;"It's a lawless zone within, it's like the Vatican"
01:35:50;01:35:52;"But I'm surprised, Mordecai"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"Because I thought that you were a populist"
01:35:54;01:35:55;"I thought that you were about"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"That fashion is for everybody"
01:35:57;01:36:00;"That you didn't respect these French and Italian people"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"Who talk down to us Americans"
01:36:02;01:36:03;"And you also like rap music"
01:36:03;01:36:06;"I thought that you would be very pro-Kanye fashion"
01:36:06;01:36:07;"You got me"
01:36:07;01:36:08;"I gotta watch the"
01:36:08;01:36:10;"I gotta go to the website and watch the show"
01:36:10;01:36:12;"Because the New York Post headline right now"
01:36:12;01:36:15;"Is Kanye's fashion show was a total disaster"
01:36:15;01:36:19;"Your love is faded"
01:36:27;01:36:30;"I feel it fade"
01:36:30;01:36:32;"When no one ain't around"
01:36:32;01:36:35;"I feel it fade"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"I think I think too much"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"I feel it fade"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"When ain't nobody watching"
01:36:41;01:36:44;"I feel it fade"
01:36:44;01:36:46;"I just fade away"
01:36:46;01:36:50;"I feel it fade"
01:36:50;01:36:54;"I feel it"
01:36:54;01:36:57;"I feel it fade"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"I think I think too much"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"I feel it"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"Your love is faded"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"I feel it"
01:37:05;01:37:08;"Roll up, roll up, hold up, hold up"
01:37:08;01:37:10;"I feel it"
01:37:10;01:37:13;"I love the, I wanna, I'm tryna"
01:37:13;01:37:16;"I feel it"
01:37:16;01:37:18;"I'ma rock the boat, work the metal 'til I hurt a little"
01:37:18;01:37:20;"I feel it"
01:37:20;01:37:22;"Your love is faded"
01:37:22;01:37:24;"I feel it"
01:37:24;01:37:26;"Realize"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"I feel it"
01:37:28;01:37:31;"Can you feel that?"
01:37:31;01:37:34;"I feel it"
01:37:34;01:37:36;"Better act like you know better"
01:37:36;01:37:40;"I feel it"
01:37:40;01:37:43;"Whoa"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"When no one ain't around"
01:37:45;01:37:48;"I feel it fade"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"I think I think too much"
01:37:50;01:37:52;"I feel it fade"
01:37:52;01:37:54;"When ain't nobody watching"
01:37:54;01:37:57;"I feel it"
01:37:57;01:37:59;"I just fade away"
01:37:59;01:38:01;"Your love is faded"
01:38:01;01:38:04;"I feel it"
01:38:07;01:38:10;"I feel I've been on my"
01:38:10;01:38:12;"Oh Lord, on my"
01:38:12;01:38:16;"I just need you now"
01:38:16;01:38:17;"I can feel it"
01:38:17;01:38:20;"Deep inside, deep deep deep inside"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"I feel it"
01:38:22;01:38:25;"Deep inside, deep deep deep inside"
01:38:25;01:38:26;"I feel it"
01:38:26;01:38:29;"Deep inside, deep deep deep inside"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"I feel it"
01:38:31;01:38:34;"Deep inside, deep deep deep inside"
01:38:34;01:38:35;"I can feel it"
01:38:35;01:38:38;"Deep inside, deep deep deep inside"
01:38:38;01:38:40;"I feel it"
01:38:40;01:38:43;"Deep inside, deep deep deep inside"
01:38:43;01:38:44;"I feel it"
01:38:44;01:38:47;"Deep inside, deep deep deep inside"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"I feel it"
01:38:49;01:38:52;"Deep inside, deep deep deep inside"
01:38:52;01:38:53;"I feel it"
01:38:53;01:38:56;"I feel it"
01:38:56;01:38:58;"I feel it"
01:38:58;01:39:03;"I feel it"
01:39:03;01:39:06;"I feel it"
01:39:09;01:39:12;"I feel it fade"
01:39:12;01:39:15;"I feel it"
01:39:15;01:39:16;"But I heard some finance stuff"
01:39:16;01:39:18;"that he sold his name,"
01:39:18;01:39:19;"I don't know if that's like"
01:39:19;01:39:21;"an Isaac Mizrahi, a Nicole Miller,"
01:39:21;01:39:22;"I don't know how that works,"
01:39:22;01:39:23;"but he sold his name,"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"had to call himself or his clothing"
01:39:25;01:39:26;"or something Yeezy or Yeezus"
01:39:26;01:39:28;"from what I understand,"
01:39:28;01:39:29;"and the guy that told him"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"don't do it, don't do it,"
01:39:31;01:39:33;"he got a call from him the other day"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"and now he's like Kanye's big CEO"
01:39:35;01:39:37;"and he's running everything."
01:39:37;01:39:39;"Oh, you mean Kanye is not legally allowed"
01:39:39;01:39:41;"to call his clothing brand Kanye West?"
01:39:41;01:39:42;"I guess he just bought it back."
01:39:42;01:39:43;"Oh, he bought his name back?"
01:39:43;01:39:44;"He got his name back"
01:39:44;01:39:45;"in the last couple days."
01:39:45;01:39:46;"Never sell your name."
01:39:46;01:39:47;"Yeah, never, ever."
01:39:47;01:39:48;"Okay, well how about this"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"for making fashion history?"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"Last week at Kanye's"
01:39:52;01:39:54;"Madison Square Garden show,"
01:39:54;01:39:56;"he broke the MSG record"
01:39:56;01:39:58;"for the most merchandise sold."
01:39:58;01:40:02;"On Monday night, he sold $780,000 worth"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"of merch."
01:40:04;01:40:06;"Now that is fashion history, is it not?"
01:40:06;01:40:07;"He sold more merch than the Pope."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"You know, the guy that took a T-shirt"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"and it wasn't Gildan"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"and wrote the life of Gildan"
01:40:13;01:40:14;"or this is not Gildan,"
01:40:14;01:40:16;"what he did for merch, Kanye,"
01:40:16;01:40:17;"is genius."
01:40:17;01:40:20;"And I went to another artist's show"
01:40:20;01:40:21;"at Madison Square Gardens"
01:40:21;01:40:22;"a couple weeks later"
01:40:22;01:40:23;"or something like that"
01:40:23;01:40:24;"or six months later, Drake,"
01:40:25;01:40:28;"and the merchandise was so..."
01:40:28;01:40:29;"You can say it."
01:40:29;01:40:32;"It wasn't like, ""Oi, this tasteful."""
01:40:32;01:40:33;"It was just like, ""Okay."""
01:40:33;01:40:35;"Revenge is in the comma."
01:40:35;01:40:36;"We don't believe in that as a Jew."
01:40:36;01:40:37;"Wait, wait, wait."
01:40:37;01:40:38;"What do you..."
01:40:38;01:40:39;"It said revenge."
01:40:39;01:40:40;"Slow down, slow down."
01:40:40;01:40:41;"He skipped a couple beats."
01:40:41;01:40:42;"No, it said revenge"
01:40:42;01:40:43;"across the baseball team."
01:40:43;01:40:44;"Drake was selling a T-shirt"
01:40:44;01:40:45;"that just said revenge."
01:40:45;01:40:46;"I like that it was majestic."
01:40:46;01:40:47;"I love that it was majestic"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"because that's like for the everyman"
01:40:49;01:40:50;"and it's also on field."
01:40:50;01:40:52;"But the revenge across the chest,"
01:40:52;01:40:53;"the controller on the front and back,"
01:40:53;01:40:54;"they were quick hits."
01:40:54;01:40:56;"Yeah, you're on the bowery,"
01:40:56;01:40:57;"but nobody cared."
01:40:57;01:40:59;"Okay, so you respect Kanye's merch"
01:40:59;01:41:00;"more than Drake's merch."
01:41:00;01:41:01;"Right."
01:41:01;01:41:02;"Fashion is very complicated, man."
01:41:02;01:41:03;"It really is,"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"but everybody here I give the credit to."
01:41:05;01:41:06;"We're in a hot studio,"
01:41:06;01:41:07;"long-sleeved tee,"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"long-sleeved shirt,"
01:41:09;01:41:10;"schvitzing like me."
01:41:10;01:41:12;"People tell me that Gucci is hot right now."
01:41:12;01:41:13;"Is this true?"
01:41:13;01:41:14;"Hell f---ing no."
01:41:14;01:41:15;"What's hot right now?"
01:41:15;01:41:16;"I mean..."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"The temperature."
01:41:17;01:41:19;"The dad hats are still hot."
01:41:19;01:41:21;"Jerseys are still hot."
01:41:21;01:41:22;"Okay, so a dad hat,"
01:41:22;01:41:24;"like a dirty old white hat"
01:41:24;01:41:26;"that says like..."
01:41:26;01:41:28;"It's a six-panel hat,"
01:41:28;01:41:29;"deconstructed."
01:41:29;01:41:30;"Now look, man,"
01:41:30;01:41:31;"you know, you pick this up"
01:41:31;01:41:33;"when you go to different clam shacks."
01:41:33;01:41:35;"Unstructured is the word I meant, actually."
01:41:35;01:41:37;"Okay, but then if I want to go to unstructured,"
01:41:37;01:41:38;"I want to go two ways,"
01:41:38;01:41:40;"bicycle hat or painter's hat"
01:41:40;01:41:41;"because that you can put in your hat"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"in your pocket."
01:41:42;01:41:44;"No, it's corny to wear a painter's hat."
01:41:44;01:41:45;"I didn't say it's hot."
01:41:45;01:41:46;"I'm just saying it's pliable."
01:41:46;01:41:47;"That's some 2009 hipster look."
01:41:47;01:41:49;"No, what's really, really hot right now,"
01:41:49;01:41:51;"I'm going to read it to you real quick here."
01:41:51;01:41:53;"Okay, guys, is everybody at home"
01:41:53;01:41:54;"ready to type this down?"
01:41:54;01:41:57;"So far we got clam shack hats, very hot."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"What else is hot?"
01:41:58;01:42:02;"Wearing utility without a conscious regard for fashion."
01:42:02;01:42:03;"Style, I suppose."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"What? Slow down."
01:42:05;01:42:06;"What does that mean?"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"Come on, you fashion experts,"
01:42:08;01:42:09;"you come in here..."
01:42:09;01:42:10;"Yeah, I'm saying..."
01:42:10;01:42:12;"And you talk to us music and finance experts,"
01:42:12;01:42:13;"and we don't understand what you're saying."
01:42:13;01:42:15;"What does that mean, utility?"
01:42:15;01:42:18;"I just want to exist in outdoor gear,"
01:42:18;01:42:22;"like utility wear, fashion in any regard."
01:42:22;01:42:25;"Like kayaking hats, canoeing outfits,"
01:42:25;01:42:27;"stuff that you can get wet in, run the city,"
01:42:27;01:42:28;"and go to your boardroom with."
01:42:28;01:42:30;"You show up to an A-FAD, whatever it's called,"
01:42:30;01:42:32;"airway, you know, cool guy jersey,"
01:42:32;01:42:33;"to a finance meeting,"
01:42:33;01:42:34;"they think you're playing soccer,"
01:42:34;01:42:36;"they take you seriously, I don't know."
01:42:36;01:42:38;"But when you show up to these finance meetings"
01:42:38;01:42:41;"and you got like, I don't even want to name the brands,"
01:42:41;01:42:42;"but stuff that you can..."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"You can name the brands, it's okay."
01:42:44;01:42:47;"No, but like jeans and outdoor research."
01:42:47;01:42:48;"Yeah, like, you know, it's like,"
01:42:48;01:42:51;"that's from the kayak to the boardroom, it really is."
01:42:51;01:42:53;"It's not from hypebeast to the boardroom."
01:42:53;01:42:54;"Okay, but what about..."
01:42:54;01:42:56;"Is this not the same thing as, I don't know,"
01:42:56;01:42:57;"what was it, three years ago,"
01:42:57;01:42:58;"everyone was talking about NormCorp,"
01:42:58;01:42:59;"you don't think it's the same thing?"
01:42:59;01:43:00;"It is, it's a contin..."
01:43:00;01:43:01;"No, it's the real NormCorp."
01:43:01;01:43:02;"I wanted to tweet all the way over here."
01:43:02;01:43:04;"This is like Pacific Northwest version of it,"
01:43:04;01:43:05;"or Maine version of it."
01:43:05;01:43:06;"Exactly, 'cause the NormCorp today,"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"they're wearing J.Crew when they think it's NormCorp."
01:43:08;01:43:09;"Right, right, right."
01:43:09;01:43:11;"No, NormCorp is Keens, it's zip-off pants."
01:43:11;01:43:14;"J.Crew just tried to cater to them anyway"
01:43:14;01:43:15;"and made all this trash."
01:43:15;01:43:17;"Exactly, and it became trash."
01:43:17;01:43:18;"Okay, but so you're saying..."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"Real NormCorp, you said it."
01:43:19;01:43:22;"Let's say there's a kid listening right now"
01:43:22;01:43:25;"who is about to go to their first day of school,"
01:43:25;01:43:27;"'cause it's kind of back-to-school season."
01:43:27;01:43:28;"Yes!"
01:43:28;01:43:29;"So let's say you're in ninth grade,"
01:43:29;01:43:31;"you're about to go back to school,"
01:43:31;01:43:33;"a lot of your classmates are probably gonna be"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"showing off their Kanye tour merch."
01:43:35;01:43:36;"Yeah, exactly."
01:43:36;01:43:37;"Wearing their Yeezys."
01:43:37;01:43:38;"They got the Pablo merch."
01:43:38;01:43:40;"And you're saying to this kid"
01:43:40;01:43:41;"that don't wear the Pablo merch,"
01:43:41;01:43:44;"you should go in a full kayak wetsuit?"
01:43:44;01:43:46;"Yes. No, no, wear a rash guard shirt"
01:43:46;01:43:49;"and wear a Helly Hansen, your dad's sailing jacket,"
01:43:49;01:43:52;"wear some ripped khakis and some f***ing Birkenstocks."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"Or worse, fake Birkenstocks."
01:43:54;01:43:55;"Okay, but here's a quick..."
01:43:55;01:43:57;"You'll get made fun of for a week."
01:43:57;01:43:59;"What if you're part of the 1% of Americans"
01:43:59;01:44:00;"whose dad doesn't sail?"
01:44:00;01:44:02;"Isn't it the 1% that sails?"
01:44:02;01:44:05;"I think 99% of dads in America sail."
01:44:05;01:44:07;"Bulls***!"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"How many of your dads in this room sail?"
01:44:09;01:44:10;"Mine does."
01:44:10;01:44:12;"I'm not sure if my dad's ever been on a boat."
01:44:12;01:44:14;"My dad doesn't know how to swim."
01:44:14;01:44:15;"That's a fun fact about our family."
01:44:15;01:44:17;"My mom doesn't know how to swim."
01:44:17;01:44:18;"My dad's pretty good."
01:44:18;01:44:19;"Does your dad know how to swim?"
01:44:19;01:44:21;"He goes to the McVay, does a quick dip real quick"
01:44:21;01:44:23;"'cause he does not know how to swim."
01:44:23;01:44:24;"Does your dad know how to swim?"
01:44:24;01:44:25;"Yeah, he knows how to swim."
01:44:25;01:44:27;"I'm the only one with a father who knows how to swim."
01:44:27;01:44:29;"Your dad knows how to swim?"
01:44:29;01:44:30;"Oh, he does."
01:44:30;01:44:31;"But your mom doesn't?"
01:44:31;01:44:32;"Oh, your mom can't?"
01:44:32;01:44:33;"My mom can't swim, ride a bike..."
01:44:33;01:44:35;"JCC memberships growing up?"
01:44:35;01:44:36;"No."
01:44:36;01:44:38;"We're not that bad."
01:44:38;01:44:39;"No, we're not."

01:48:18;01:48:19;"What about young women?"
01:48:19;01:48:21;"Do you think this is a unisex look?"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"You should borrow stuff from the boy that you met"
01:48:23;01:48:25;"in the summer and you took it and you want to remember him"
01:48:25;01:48:27;"for the first semester 'til you forget him."
01:48:27;01:48:31;"Do you think that all clothes work however you identify"
01:48:31;01:48:33;"in terms of gender, male, female, or other?"
01:48:33;01:48:35;"I hate personally when I go into a store"
01:48:35;01:48:37;"and the salesman looks at me and he's like,"
01:48:37;01:48:38;"""Oh, it's unisex."""
01:48:38;01:48:41;"Tell me it's f---ing women's or tell me it's men's."
01:48:41;01:48:42;"I'm not afraid."
01:48:42;01:48:44;"The girls should not be afraid to go straight"
01:48:44;01:48:47;"to the men's department and know that they're wearing menswear."
01:48:47;01:48:49;"Okay, so you're saying that you believe clothes"
01:48:49;01:48:52;"should be presented with a gender binary,"
01:48:52;01:48:56;"but you should be able to destroy that binary as you dress."
01:48:56;01:48:57;"Yes."
01:48:57;01:48:59;"Any other tips for people going back to school"
01:48:59;01:49:01;"or maybe back to work for the older folks"
01:49:01;01:49:03;"who are coming back off of their vacation?"
01:49:03;01:49:04;"Mm-hmm."
01:49:04;01:49:06;"Roll your pants down, stop showing the ankles,"
01:49:06;01:49:07;"maybe put socks on."
01:49:07;01:49:09;"You don't think you should show your ankle at work?"
01:49:09;01:49:10;"Definitely not."
01:49:10;01:49:11;"Why?"
01:49:11;01:49:13;"I don't care if you got a blister in the back of your heel"
01:49:13;01:49:16;"or you're working on your tan on your lunch break."
01:49:16;01:49:17;"It's just inappropriate."
01:49:17;01:49:20;"So my question to you is, you just got back from vacation,"
01:49:20;01:49:22;"you're back in the office,"
01:49:22;01:49:25;"you should be wearing a kayak outfit with socks?"
01:49:25;01:49:27;"Unless you're like, you know, a sales guy--"
01:49:27;01:49:29;"The lashes, fisherman's hat."
01:49:29;01:49:34;"--at the sports authority in, like, deep in New Jersey"
01:49:34;01:49:36;"and you're climbing on your lunch break."
01:49:36;01:49:38;"Okay, now let's say that this summer"
01:49:38;01:49:41;"you couldn't for whatever reason make it out to a clam shack,"
01:49:41;01:49:45;"but you managed to save up and order the clam shack hat online."
01:49:45;01:49:48;"Do you need to create a fake story to go along with it?"
01:49:48;01:49:50;"It depends. If you have an Instagram account,"
01:49:50;01:49:52;"you might want to backdate a little bit, see where you were,"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"just find something regional."
01:49:54;01:49:56;"You know, sometimes when I leave a place, a city, a country,"
01:49:56;01:49:59;"I look on eBay for a patch of that city"
01:49:59;01:50:01;"'cause I want to have that souvenir I didn't scoop."
01:50:01;01:50:05;"Is it important when you get back to school or work after the summer"
01:50:05;01:50:08;"to have an item that shows people where you went?"
01:50:08;01:50:09;"Yes."
01:50:09;01:50:10;"'Cause you need people to know where you went."
01:50:10;01:50:12;"I was here, you weren't."
01:50:12;01:50:13;"Oh, so it's a competitive thing."
01:50:13;01:50:14;"Like social media."
01:50:14;01:50:16;"Is it good to be more mysterious, though?"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"Yeah, if you could find, like, a gefilte fish hat"
01:50:18;01:50:21;"and tell them that you were at the clam shack, yeah."
01:50:21;01:50:23;"But otherwise, no, it shouldn't be too mysterious."
01:50:23;01:50:25;"Okay, but how about this?"
01:50:25;01:50:26;"You get back to school,"
01:50:26;01:50:30;"everybody else is wearing kayak outfits and clam shack hats,"
01:50:30;01:50:33;"but maybe you just put on some simple khaki shorts,"
01:50:33;01:50:35;"a white T-shirt, and a pair of Converse,"
01:50:35;01:50:37;"and then everybody says to you,"
01:50:37;01:50:39;"""Kenneth, how was your summer?"""
01:50:39;01:50:42;"And you say, ""It was great. I went to over 100 clam shacks,"
01:50:42;01:50:45;"""but we're back at school now, so let's focus on math."""
01:50:45;01:50:47;"Isn't that kind of a cool move?"
01:50:47;01:50:49;"I think so. He'll probably get beat up."
01:50:49;01:50:52;"So just to wrap up,"
01:50:52;01:50:55;"for all the people about to go back to school or work,"
01:50:55;01:50:57;"no Kanye fashion gear,"
01:50:57;01:51:00;"but maybe some concert merchandise is okay."
01:51:00;01:51:03;"Maybe a nice Seafood Paradise hat."
01:51:03;01:51:04;"Season four."
01:51:04;01:51:08;"And just some type of kayak thing."
01:51:08;01:51:13;"Mordegai, thank you so much for teaching us about Fashion Week"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"and giving us some of your rules."
01:51:15;01:51:16;"To everybody listening at home..."
01:51:16;01:51:18;"These are old rules, not mine."
01:51:18;01:51:20;"It's true. These are some of the oldest fashion rules."
01:51:20;01:51:23;"Clam shack hats and kayak outfits."
01:51:23;01:51:25;"You must be rocking."
01:51:25;01:51:27;"But we always appreciate hearing your perspective."
01:51:27;01:51:28;"Thank you so much."
01:51:28;01:51:30;"We'll definitely have you back"
01:51:30;01:51:33;"and look forward to more adventures in fashion."
