00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis back again with an action-packed episode. On this week's TC,"
00:06;00:12;"Jake and I discuss Neo Yokio Pink Christmas, the ConAgra food universe. We"
00:12;00:17;"also talked to Vic Berger about his new album, plus the creator of the Joker Man"
00:17;00:25;"font, Andrew Smith. All this plus the greatest hits of 2018 and 1995. This is"
00:25;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:31;00:38;"Peace."
01:16;01:22;"Time Crisis back again. So Jake, yeah, we were just talking, we got a plan the TC"
01:22;01:28;"Christmas party. Right, we did one last year. Awkwardly formal Italian restaurant."
01:28;01:31;"I remember getting there kind of early. Mm-hmm. I sat at the bar, bought like a"
01:31;01:37;"$12 whiskey. It ended up just being a four-man dinner at an Italian restaurant."
01:37;01:42;"Yeah. Because not even all the producers could come. So just was you, me, Seinfeld"
01:42;01:47;"2000, and Nick just sitting at this awkwardly formal dinner. Very formal"
01:47;01:52;"dinner. Bitcoin was in its prime. We talked about cryptocurrency. Right. I still have"
01:52;01:57;"Coinbase on my phone. And me too. How often do you check in? Not that often. The"
01:57;02:01;"meager amount of money I put into it is now close to worthless. I did have"
02:01;02:06;"friends though that bought in like maybe summer of 2017. Yeah, and did they sell at"
02:06;02:12;"the right time? One did. One held on too long? One friend made a few thousand dollars."
02:12;02:16;"That's decent. Don't you think it's gonna come back in like a decade? Like we'll"
02:16;02:19;"forget all about it and then it's gonna be like, yeah, oh my god. I'm not gonna"
02:19;02:25;"sell now. No. You don't buy high and sell low. I'm into that. You're getting other"
02:25;02:29;"people money. It's very altruistic to buy high, sell low. What's the investing thing"
02:29;02:32;"that people, I feel like investing guys always tell me this. How often are you"
02:32;02:37;"talking to investing guys? Not in a while. I remember at some point, I mean, I don't"
02:37;02:40;"know if I've said this on the show. I always thought that I'd be more interested"
02:40;02:43;"in money. I think when I was a little kid, you know, I said I wanted to be like a"
02:43;02:46;"musician or an astronaut. And I remember kind of like around middle school,"
02:46;02:50;"probably rubbed off on me from some other kids, like just hearing from other kids at"
02:50;02:52;"school being like, what do you want to be when you grow up? And then just kind of"
02:52;02:56;"seeing like a certain type of like cool kid in my suburban town, be like, I want to be"
02:56;03:00;"a businessman. And I kind of remember that like rubbing off on me, be like, oh, do I"
03:00;03:02;"want to be a businessman too? Yep. There's always like in the back of my head, I was"
03:02;03:06;"like, you know, I've always gravitated towards the arts, but like I always liked"
03:06;03:09;"math. So I was kind of like, you know what, one day I bet I'll be pretty interested in"
03:09;03:13;"like managing my finances, things of that nature. Turns out not at all. This could be"
03:13;03:18;"revisionist history, but I remember when I met you 2005, maybe you just finished your"
03:18;03:22;"sophomore or junior year of college. Yeah. And we were on that tour, which has been"
03:22;03:26;"referenced the Dirty Projectors a few times on the show. Yeah. You know, and I was"
03:26;03:31;"like 27 or something. Yeah. And I was like doing not much. But I was like, Ezra,"
03:31;03:35;"what's your vibe after school, man? Like, what are you going to do? Like, what are you"
03:35;03:39;"thinking about? What I say? Law school? Maybe I'm making this up. No, no. I was like,"
03:39;03:45;"maybe Wall Street. Is that crazy? There was a lot of things getting bandied about. I did"
03:45;03:50;"also apply for the CIA. Are you serious? Yeah. But just on their website, somehow this"
03:50;03:53;"like rumor got out of control. And like I saw somebody else being like, you know, the"
03:53;03:57;"CIA tried to recruit Ezra. But the truth is, I vaguely remember just like being a"
03:57;04:01;"senior and being like, what should I do? See, I remember this. I was like, huh, maybe it"
04:01;04:05;"would be cool to live abroad. I don't know. Maybe I was just like looking at some dumb"
04:05;04:08;"college websites, like apply to the CIA. And at the time, I didn't even think about like"
04:08;04:11;"the ethical implications or anything. I was just kind of like, all right, let me check"
04:11;04:14;"it out. I just remember they had like an online forum. You know, they're just like"
04:14;04:21;"college major, English, languages spoken, one English. And I was kind of like, yeah,"
04:21;04:25;"they're not going to hit me back. But I don't know. It's not like I was particularly"
04:25;04:30;"interested in like espionage or, you know, regime change. I was like, that'd be cool."
04:30;04:33;"Furthering American interest abroad. I'm sure I would have hated that. I was just kind of"
04:33;04:36;"like, might be cool to, you know, live somewhere else."
04:36;04:43;"Ice age heat wave can't complain if the world's at large. Why should I remain? Walked away"
04:43;04:50;"to another planet. Gonna find another place maybe one I can stand. I move on to another"
04:50;04:57;"day. To a whole new town with a whole new way. Went to the porch to have a thought."
04:57;05:03;"Got to the door and again I couldn't stop. You don't know where and you don't know when."
05:03;05:10;"But you still got your words and you got your friends. Walking on to another day. Work a"
05:10;05:17;"little harder, work another way. Well, uh-uh, baby, I ain't got no plan. Floating on maybe"
05:17;05:23;"would you understand? Gonna float along maybe would you understand? Well, I float along"
05:23;05:25;"maybe would you understand?"
05:25;05:32;"Anyway, the thing that investment people say is be fearful when others are greedy and greedy"
05:32;05:33;"when others are fearful."
05:33;05:41;"Oh, wow. So Seinfeld and I got burned on the crypto craze of late 2017 because"
05:41;05:44;"Because you guys were greedy when you should have been fearful."
05:44;05:47;"And I kept diversifying and that was no good."
05:47;05:48;"You got Ripple."
05:48;05:49;"Ethereum."
05:49;05:50;"You got Litecoin."
05:50;05:53;"I thought let me spread this out. Let me, you know, bet on a few horses."
05:53;05:54;"So now."
05:54;05:55;"It's all worthless."
05:55;05:59;"So now, well, of course, yeah, it's one thing when you're talking about like the S&P 500,"
05:59;06:04;"which at least has held value for a long time. Crypto is a little is a little shakier. Who"
06:04;06:09;"knows? But now crypto is down in the toilet. All these guys like Seinfeld who invested"
06:09;06:12;"their life savings in it. He's freaking out right now. He's fearful."
06:12;06:14;"I put everything into that crypto."
06:14;06:19;"But you know what? According to the finance bros, now's the time to get greedy, actually."
06:19;06:24;"Because we come in and we see the Seinfelds of the world who took all the money he made"
06:24;06:29;"from doing social media and he put it right into crypto. And now he's freaking out."
06:29;06:33;"He's like, OK, I'll take pennies on the dollar for my Ethereum."
06:33;06:36;"And then a greedy guy comes in and says, here's a few pennies."
06:36;06:41;"And then you take your pennies and you go buy back some followers on Twitter or whatever you do."
06:41;06:46;"Yeah. Looking back at that crypto craze in late 2017, I'm a little embarrassed."
06:46;06:51;"I didn't go crazy on it. I put a little bit of money in because I just like I really just"
06:51;06:53;"got taken for a ride."
06:53;06:59;"Just picture Jake at our last Christmas party, drunk off his ass, just down in twenty seven"
06:59;07:04;"dollar fancy vodka martinis. And we're like, Jake, man, that's not really expensive stuff,"
07:04;07:08;"man. You're like, I want the veal. I want the eighty dollar steak."
07:08;07:14;"And we're like, well, Jake, you don't eat veal. And you're like, guys, I'm in crypto."
07:14;07:18;"But this time next year, I'll buy this whole restaurant. And we're like, OK, Jake, I know"
07:18;07:20;"it's up right now, but come on, man."
07:20;07:24;"I remember you were wearing a full Versace sweatsuit. It was very out of character."
07:24;07:28;"You were like putting sauce on it. You're like, I don't care. I got three more of these."
07:28;07:32;"It was a weird time in my life. I remember we were like, Jake, you want to go see"
07:32;07:36;"Dedenko next year? And you were like, I can't. I'm beyond a PJ to Vegas to see"
07:36;07:41;"chain smokers. And we're like, damn, you've changed, man. Anyway, that lock changes in a year."
07:41;07:45;"Well, the crypto crash brought me back down to earth. You kept telling us I'm going to"
07:45;07:50;"crypto Jake at that point. Right. Right. You said, call me crypto Jake."
07:50;07:56;"This was like a weird 10 day period in my life. I was there. I'm ashamed to relive this."
07:56;07:58;"You were the crypto wolf of Wall Street."
07:58;08:08;"I have a mansion, forget the price. Ain't never been there, they tell me it's nice."
08:08;08:18;"I live in hotels, tear out the walls. I have accountants pay for it all."
08:18;08:32;"They say I'm crazy, but I have a good time. I'm just looking for clues at the scene of a crime."
08:32;08:37;"Life's been good to me so far."
08:37;08:42;"We got to talk a little bit about Neo Yokio. It'll be out this Friday on Netflix,"
08:42;08:45;"but we just had a screening. Saw it last night. Which you guys are at."
08:45;08:50;"Did you catch there's a crypto reference? Remind me. I think I missed it."
08:50;08:53;"The sales clerk comes to Kaz's apartment, gives him the watch, and then he says,"
08:53;08:58;"Charles will pay you. And then Charles, a.k.a. Jude Law says, ""Ethereum or Ripple?"""
08:58;09:00;"And he says, ""Cashier's check will suffice."""
09:00;09:03;"I like that you guys didn't go Bitcoin. You went a little deeper."
09:03;09:07;"Yeah. I think the original line was, ""Which form of cryptocurrency would you prefer?"""
09:07;09:10;"And we were like, ""It's a little on the nose."" We're just like, ""This one's for the heads."""
09:10;09:13;"So we just edited it down. So he just goes, ""Ethereum or Ripple?"""
09:13;09:16;"Like coin or?"
09:16;09:21;"Ethereum or Ripple are the coolest ones anyway because it doesn't have coin in it."
09:21;09:23;"Right. Hold on. Hold on."
09:23;09:25;"We should talk more about Neo Yokio."
09:25;09:28;"Thanks for coming to the Friends and Family screening, guys."
09:28;09:29;"Saw the Christmas special last night."
09:29;09:31;"It's called Neo Yokio Pink Christmas."
09:31;09:32;"Hilarious."
09:32;09:34;"It's a feature film. Thank you."
09:34;09:37;"I wonder if people will get the sense of humor more now."
09:37;09:39;"I mean, I felt like we doubled down a little bit."
09:39;09:41;"I think it was funnier."
09:41;09:43;"Yeah. This one might have been more straightforwardly funny."
09:43;09:47;"In my memory of the first season, this was just straight up funnier."
09:47;09:48;"Yeah. I could see that."
09:48;09:50;"It was very satirical. Yeah."
09:50;09:54;"See, I think we always thought of Neo Yokio as being obviously satirical,"
09:54;09:58;"but we also thought a lot of the humor came from the awkwardness."
09:58;10:03;"And this one maybe perhaps has more just straightforward jokes and obvious satire."
10:03;10:10;"Yes. And the satire in terms of the subject matter of the satire was not that far from the TC universe."
10:10;10:13;"Maybe this one is a little more TC influenced."
10:13;10:15;"I mean, a lot of corporate retail stuff."
10:15;10:17;"That's true. I didn't even think about that."
10:17;10:24;"Actually, we need somebody now to make yet another Venn diagram that's Vampire Weekend, Time Crisis, and Neo Yokio."
10:24;10:30;"I mean, even just the opening shots of the Christmas special, like all high-end corporate retail."
10:30;10:31;"Right."
10:31;10:33;"And I was like, ""Well, okay."""
10:33;10:36;"I was waiting for maybe one shot of just like Quiznos."
10:36;10:41;"The closest we got later was the people you'll see when you watch it,"
10:41;10:47;"but there is a brief reference to the famous Domino's Pizza Rolex, which we were talking after the screening, is real."
10:47;10:49;"Right. I didn't know that."
10:49;10:51;"And generally speaking, Neo Yokio, a lot of this is real."
10:51;10:56;"Like some don't even have to satirize because it just is funny."
10:56;11:00;"And then, yeah, the whole subplot with the Capri branding."
11:00;11:02;"Oh, the Caprese. Yeah."
11:02;11:07;"Sorry, Caprese. Reminded me of the TC merch craze."
11:07;11:11;"Oh, yeah. That's very like some TC Test Kitchen type [beep]"
11:11;11:13;"Yeah, that was a great story."
11:13;11:17;"They're talking about the Lexi and Gottlieb played by Desus and Mero."
11:17;11:20;"They're supporting characters in Neo Yokio, but I think they always steal the show."
11:20;11:22;"Even when they have kind of like the C plot."
11:22;11:23;"Oh, yeah."
11:23;11:25;"It always like is kind of my favorite."
11:25;11:31;"I would say in terms of the Christmas specials that I've seen, this had the highest sum of curse words."
11:31;11:37;"We didn't think about it that much because there's never been like a ton of cursing in the NYU, which is the Neo Yokio universe."
11:37;11:38;"A lot of F-bombs."
11:38;11:40;"Yeah, there were kind of a lot."
11:40;11:45;"When we finally watched the whole thing down, we're like, oh, damn, there's a lot of just like, what the [beep]"
11:45;11:47;"Yeah. When I was watching, I was like in the second row."
11:47;11:50;"And then a friend of ours had brought his nine-year-old daughter."
11:50;11:51;"Oh, yeah."
11:51;11:54;"And she was on like a bean bag on the floor in front."
11:54;11:56;"The screening went down at Netflix headquarters, by the way."
11:56;11:57;"HQ on Sunset."
11:57;11:58;"Yeah."
11:58;11:59;"Very snazzy."
11:59;12:06;"And the first time that you guys dropped like an egregious F-bomb, I remember her like kind of scandalized looking back at her dad."
12:06;12:09;"And then her dad obviously paid it no mind."
12:09;12:11;"And it was just maybe just like kind of gave her like, uh-huh."
12:11;12:13;"Yeah, there's some cursing."
12:13;12:18;"And then like by the time there was like the 15th F-bomb, she was just like coasting with it."
12:18;12:23;"Cursing is very scandalous when you're a kid because at school, that's like this obsession."
12:23;12:24;"Right."
12:24;12:29;"But the cursing in the Christmas special is not aggressive or crass."
12:29;12:33;"Is it too much of a spoiler to say there's a little bit of new music?"
12:33;12:35;"We'll play it on the next show."
12:35;12:42;"But there is-- it's definitely not Vampire Weekend, but there's one and a half original songs in this."
12:42;12:47;"Shout out to Blood Pop, Jaden, and Makonnen who are all involved in it."
12:47;12:50;"Damn, too bad Neo-Yokio Pink Christmas didn't have a theatrical release."
12:50;12:55;"Otherwise, maybe we could be in Oscar contenders along with Shallow."
12:55;12:57;"Toe to toe with B-Coop."
12:57;12:58;"Yeah."
12:58;13:00;"Does anyone call him B-Coop?"
13:00;13:02;"Yeah, probably. Or maybe just Coop."
13:02;13:04;"Anyway, everybody check out Neo-Yokio Pink Christmas."
13:04;13:06;"It's basically a feature film."
13:06;13:12;"It's 65 minutes long, which is not a common length for a feature film, but I think we're pioneering something."
13:12;13:13;"We're bringing it back."
13:13;13:14;"That's a good length for a movie."
13:14;13:16;"You can see that on Netflix, the streaming service?"
13:16;13:19;"Oh, yeah, you can see it on Netflix, the streaming service."
14:38;14:44;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beast1."
14:44;14:47;"By the way, in a recent episode, we kind of put it out to the TC heads."
14:47;14:52;"We posed the question, what do you call the main universe that we live in?"
14:52;14:59;"You know, we said, like, you go see a Marvel Cinematic Universe film, and you're in the Marvel Cinematic Universe when you're watching it,"
14:59;15:03;"and then you leave the theater and you're back in what some people used to call real life,"
15:03;15:07;"although it's problematic to call that real life because some people live on the internet now."
15:07;15:14;"I saw somebody say something about the PU, the primary universe, which is maybe a Donnie Darko reference or something."
15:14;15:17;"Yeah, that's from Lindsey on Twitter."
15:17;15:24;"She said, per the silverback millennial classic Donnie Darko, it's called the PU, primary universe, in brackets."
15:24;15:28;"Okay, I'm into that. I don't like saying PU, but I like primary universe."
15:28;15:31;"There was one good one I saw. I'm sorry, I don't remember who wrote it,"
15:31;15:37;"but this guy actually suggested that since Time Crisis is not fiction, Marvel is fake."
15:37;15:38;"TC is real."
15:38;15:43;"And TC is real, that theoretically, we could just call the real world the TCU."
15:43;15:51;"The Time Crisis universe is not just the show. The Time Crisis universe also includes the universe that Time Crisis is a part of."
15:51;15:59;"And arguably, Time Crisis makes sense to be the umbrella universe because on Time Crisis we talk about all this other stuff."
15:59;16:00;"Reality."
16:00;16:06;"Right. So arguably, when you go see Avengers Age of Ultron, you're in the MCU,"
16:06;16:09;"and then you step out of the theater, you're back in the Time Crisis universe."
16:09;16:11;"That was one suggestion."
16:11;16:13;"What about the STU? S-T-U."
16:13;16:14;"What's that?"
16:14;16:16;"Straight up universe."
16:16;16:20;"But what I did was just took the ST out of straight up."
16:20;16:25;"I like that. It's an unusual acronym because you're taking two letters from one word."
16:25;16:30;"Yeah. You could do S-T-U-U, straight up universe, STU."
16:30;16:31;"I like that, the STU."
16:31;16:35;"I didn't even think you were going for an acronym. I thought you were just comparing life to a STU."
16:35;16:36;"Yeah, it is."
16:36;16:37;"You're getting a little bit metaphorical."
16:37;16:38;"Oh, yeah, that's kind of cool, too."
16:38;16:40;"Yeah, you're just in the STU."
16:40;16:43;"Oh, put like an umlaut over one of the U's?"
16:43;16:45;"Like Stussy?"
16:45;16:48;"Husker-do? Husker-stew?"
16:48;16:52;"Okay, man, we live in the STU. The TCU is a part of the STU."
17:51;17:57;"Now that it's become kind of trendy to have universes, everybody wants a universe."
17:57;18:04;"So what used to be considered a portfolio of bullsh*t is now getting rebranded as a universe."
18:04;18:09;"So, you know, Disney always, we kind of grew up with Disney as a universe, and there'd be like Hanna-Barbera,"
18:09;18:12;"something like a little bit lower down the totem pole, and you'd kind of be like,"
18:12;18:14;"""What is Hanna-Barbera?"" It's just like sh*t, you're Disney."
18:14;18:20;"And then be like, ""Well, hold your horses, actually. It's a universe. It's the HBU, the Hanna-Barbera universe."""
18:20;18:27;"And as soon as you confer universe status on something, suddenly these random things in the portfolio,"
18:27;18:29;"they take on some gravitas."
18:29;18:32;"Don't disregard the Motley Crue universe."
18:32;18:38;"Yeah, exactly. Or like remember when we talked to the chief marketing officer of Frito-Lay,"
18:38;18:42;"and she would refer a lot to the Frito-Lay portfolio of products."
18:42;18:46;"I wouldn't be surprised if over there now they're talking about it more the universe of products,"
18:46;18:51;"because why should only Marvel get to have a universe? Why can't you call it the Frito-Lay universe?"
18:51;18:52;"Or the Pluckers universe."
18:53;18:58;"And if Frito-Lay isn't going to start thinking about their portfolio of products as a universe,"
18:58;19:01;"they better start, because it's not just for fiction anymore."
19:01;19:06;"It's not just for movie studios. And I'll tell you why, because General Mills, you know General Mills?"
19:06;19:07;"I'm familiar."
19:07;19:12;"You heard of them? General Mills, who we mostly know as a really massive American cereal company,"
19:12;19:14;"they're building their own cinematic universe."
19:14;19:15;"Cinematic?"
19:15;19:16;"Oh yeah."
19:16;19:19;"Not retail universe?"
19:19;19:21;"No, they're building a cinematic universe."
19:21;19:22;"Okay."
19:22;19:26;"And it's partially because there have always been these kind of one-dimensional characters"
19:26;19:30;"who are helped to brand, you know, food items."
19:30;19:33;"And General Mills, you know, we're talking about, they have all these monsters."
19:33;19:36;"We got Count Chocula, who's very famous,"
19:36;19:37;"Frankenberry,"
19:37;19:39;"Fruity Yummy Mummy,"
19:39;19:40;"Boo Berry,"
19:40;19:43;"and apparently there was somebody called Fruit Brute."
19:43;19:46;"So Count Chocula, the feature film."
19:46;19:51;"Basically. I think probably a smart, young college graduate over there was like,"
19:51;19:55;"""Man, our cereals aren't as poppin' as Cheerios or something."
19:55;19:59;"Like, we got these corny old cereals that are kind of these fake monsters."""
19:59;20:02;"And so we go, ""Well, hold on a second. That sounds like quite an asset."""
20:02;20:07;"We're so much more than a portfolio of cereals. We're a cinematic universe."
20:07;20:10;"Somebody had that light bulb go off."
20:10;20:14;"Wow. This, real quick, this is reminding me of,"
20:14;20:17;"what year did Wikipedia start, you think?"
20:17;20:20;"Pfft. Late 90s, early 2000s?"
20:20;20:23;"Okay. Because I remember my friend Jason Anderson,"
20:23;20:28;"and maybe my friend Steve Schrader, who's a big TC head, can send me this information,"
20:28;20:30;"if he still has it."
20:30;20:35;"My friend Jason Anderson wrote a really long history"
20:35;20:38;"that he completely fabricated about Count Chocula."
20:38;20:39;"Whoa."
20:39;20:41;"And it was on a Wikipedia page."
20:41;20:45;"He started the Count Chocula Wikipedia page in 2002 or whatever."
20:45;20:48;"Probably before there were thousands of people double-checking everything."
20:48;20:54;"And he wrote this incredibly elaborate, fictitious history about the real Count Chocula."
20:54;20:55;"Whoa."
20:55;20:56;"From Bavaria."
20:56;20:59;"And it was all just completely invented and hilarious."
20:59;21:04;"And then he got very angry correspondence from Wikipedia."
21:04;21:06;"And they took it down."
21:06;21:08;"And they were like, ""You are not allowed to do this."""
21:08;21:09;"And he got banned."
21:09;21:12;"I don't know if he got banned, but he got shut down hard."
21:12;21:13;"Pretty fast."
21:13;21:14;"Yeah."
21:14;21:17;"But I remember at the time it was like--"
21:17;21:19;"I mean, it still is funny, but at the time it was like,"
21:19;21:23;"""Whoa, dude, there's this encyclopedia online, and you can just like--"
21:23;21:25;"Wait, what? You just found it?"""
21:25;21:27;"Wait, the actual text?"
21:27;21:33;"""Ernest Chocula was born the third child to Estonian landowners in the late autumn of 1873."
21:33;21:38;"His parents, Ivan and Bruskin Chocula, were well-established traders of Baltic grain,"
21:38;21:46;"who by the early 20th century had established a monopolistic hold on the export markets of Lithuania, Latvia, and southern Finland."
21:46;21:49;"A clever child, Ernest advanced quickly through secondary schooling,"
21:49;21:56;"and at the age of 19 was managing one of the six Tallinn area farms along with his father and older brother, Grinch."
21:56;22:00;"By 24, he appeared in his first barreled cereal endorsement."
22:00;22:04;"As the Chocula family debuted, Ernest Chocula's golden wheat muesli,"
22:04;22:12;"a packaged mix that was netted for horses, mules, and the hospital-ridden Belarusian immigrant,"
22:12;22:18;"sole attenders started cutting the product with vodka, creating a crude mush paste they called gruel or gruel,"
22:18;22:21;"and would eat the concoction each morning before work."
22:21;22:26;"The trend unwittingly spread, with alcohol being replaced by sheep and then cow's milk,"
22:26;22:35;"and the demand for the Chocula's cereal reached as far south as Poland and as far west as the northern Jutland province of Denmark."
22:35;22:36;"Wow, this is a long article."
22:36;22:38;"Wait, so where is that text now?"
22:38;22:46;"There's some like internet archive that found my friend Jason's very elaborate and hilarious fake history."
22:46;22:50;"Well, he should submit because this is some Droga 5 level s*** actually."
22:50;22:55;"Look, it'd be one thing if there was a news story that was like ""General Mills wants to make movies."""
22:55;22:58;"Okay, cool. That comes and goes."
22:58;23:03;"But instead, they launched a website called workwiththemonsters.com."
23:03;23:06;"And everybody should go check this out, workwiththemonsters.com."
23:06;23:09;"When you open it, there's a picture of three of the characters."
23:09;23:11;"I believe that's Count Chocula and Boo Berry."
23:11;23:14;"I don't know what that pink-- is that pink guy Fruit Brute?"
23:14;23:16;"And it says ""Hello, Hollywood."""

23:44;23:47;"This is PG-13 and up content."

24:14;24:16;"Or is there actually something to fill out?"
24:16;24:19;"I guess there is a real form that you could fill out."
24:19;24:22;"Maybe they're just trying to get people's email addresses."
24:22;24:23;"That's probably what it is."
24:23;24:27;"Can you picture, like, some down-on-their-luck screenwriter who's like--"
24:27;24:32;"They see this and they're like, ""I've had an idea for a Count Chocula movie my whole life."""
24:32;24:35;"""I never thought that I could go pitch it. This is it."""
24:35;24:37;"And then they, like, sign up, submit it."
24:37;24:39;"They, like, spend a week, like, perfecting the pitch."
24:39;24:40;"They submit it on this website."
24:40;24:42;"And then, like, they're just waiting and waiting to hear something back."
24:42;24:45;"And then two weeks later, they just get an email from General Mills."
24:45;24:51;"It's just like, ""Hey, cereal lovers, we're doing 20% off Boo-Berry Crunch."""
24:51;24:52;"[laughs]"
24:52;24:53;"""Click here to buy."""
24:53;24:55;"And it's like, ""What the f***?"""
24:55;24:57;"They just took my email address."

25:01;25:04;"""Can't unsubscribe? Do not reply to this email."""
25:04;25:05;"[laughs]"

25:14;25:19;"""Sure. If it's an interesting story told in an interesting manner, the medium doesn't matter."""
25:19;25:20;"Whoa."
25:20;25:22;"So, fictitious Wikipedia."
25:22;25:25;"Can we do an internet radio show about Frankenberry?"
25:25;25:29;"Can we get my friend Jason Anderson retroactively paid 15 years later?"
25:29;25:31;"He deserves it."

26:36;26:37;"Yeah, yeah."
26:37;26:40;"I was in bed watching a film or program on my laptop."
26:40;26:41;"Wow."
26:41;26:43;"I can't remember if it was a film or a program."
26:43;26:45;"Honestly, it doesn't matter."
26:45;26:48;"And I see this ad that really caught my eye."
26:48;26:52;"Because any time you see a commercial and you're not sure what it's for,"
26:52;26:55;"back in the day that'd be considered bad advertising."
26:55;27:00;"Whereas now, you could do some weird-ass Super Bowl ad about World War II"
27:00;27:02;"and just be like, ""What the--what was this about?"""
27:02;27:04;"And then just be like, ""Burger King."""
27:04;27:08;"Because they're playing a bigger game than just, you know, our product is good."
27:08;27:10;"So I saw this ad on my laptop."
27:10;27:13;"And Jake, you watch it and then we can narrate it."
27:13;27:16;"See kind of a good-looking guy in a convenience store,"
27:16;27:18;"and it says, ""Be the snack king."""
27:18;27:21;"And he's holding a bunch of snacks, and there's an animated crown on his head."
27:21;27:23;"And he knighted a kid with a Slim Jim,"
27:23;27:26;"and then he throws some David pumpkin seeds around."
27:26;27:28;"And then he's in a car with his friends."
27:28;27:29;"It's a short ad."
27:29;27:31;"It's a short ad, and it says, ""Be the snack king."""
27:31;27:34;"Wait, hold up. David pumpkin seeds?"
27:34;27:35;"Yeah."
27:35;27:36;"This is--you eat this?"
27:36;27:40;"David is a brand that makes pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds in all different flavors."
27:40;27:42;"Never understood those as snacks."
27:42;27:44;"But it is a classic snack."
27:44;27:47;"No, but I don't understand it. Like, do you actually eat the seed?"
27:47;27:49;"You eat the inside part, and you spit out the shell."
27:49;27:51;"Oh, no. What is this, salted?"
27:51;27:53;"Well, it comes in all different flavors."
27:53;27:55;"Like, you could probably get Chipotle barbecue at this point."
27:55;27:57;"There's probably ranch sunflower seeds."
27:57;28:00;"It's very kind of American, but--"
28:00;28:02;"So is that an ad you would see on TV?"
28:02;28:04;"I don't know. I saw it on the Internet."
28:04;28:08;"And it says, ""Be the snack king,"" and then it shows a box of Crunch 'n Munch."
28:08;28:09;"Terrible snack."
28:09;28:11;"Buttery toffee Crunch 'n Munch,"
28:11;28:15;"which is basically kind of like a Cracker Jack type thing, you know?"
28:15;28:16;"Uh-huh."
28:16;28:20;"And then it showed David pumpkin seeds, David sunflower seeds,"
28:20;28:24;"then Slim Jim beef jerky, and then some Slim Jim sticks."
28:24;28:25;"That's a rough portfolio."
28:25;28:27;"It's a rough portfolio."
28:27;28:31;"So I was like, they're not even saying what the company is that owns all these things."
28:31;28:35;"They're basically just saying, like, we control so much of the snack share"
28:35;28:39;"of your local convenience store that we're just encouraging you to snack, basically."
28:39;28:44;"We don't even need to be on some, like, brought to you by the whatever family of--"
28:44;28:45;"You know, they're just kind of saying, like--"
28:45;28:48;"Because, like, you know, if Marvel was doing an ad for their cinematic universe,"
28:48;28:52;"they would make sure, you know, ""By the way, Aquaman, that's not us."""
28:52;28:54;"This is kind of just like, you know, go snack."
28:54;28:55;"Here's a bunch of different snacks."
28:55;28:56;"It's a very unfocused commercial."
28:56;28:58;"And it's all very third-tier stuff."
28:58;29:00;"Yeah, this is, like, T-level snacks."
29:00;29:04;"So then I was like, ""Well, so what is this company that's advertising"
29:04;29:06;"all these different snacks at once?"""
29:06;29:07;"It's a major company."
29:07;29:08;"So they didn't say."
29:08;29:09;"No, they don't say."
29:09;29:13;"It was just sort of, like, really just washed over you very quickly."
29:13;29:14;"What's the point of that?"
29:14;29:17;"You're never going to internalize that."
29:17;29:18;"I guess they're trying to say--"
29:18;29:21;"You're never going to be like, ""Oh, yeah, David sunflower seeds."""
29:21;29:22;"It's snack-aware."
29:22;29:23;"It's a snack PSA."
29:23;29:26;"The best part--I guess they decided it was better just to advertise"
29:26;29:30;"being a snacker than doing, like--yeah, like, maybe they're--"
29:30;29:32;"say their budget's a million dollars, and they're kind of like,"
29:32;29:36;"""Okay, so we'll give $250 to our David guys."
29:36;29:37;"Here's $250 to the Slim Jim guys."
29:37;29:38;"Here's $250."""
29:38;29:40;"They're like, ""No, [bleep] this."
29:40;29:43;"Let's bet big on the whole portfolio and just say,"
29:43;29:45;"'Look, we basically own snacking.'"""
29:45;29:46;"You don't."
29:46;29:48;"You don't own Jack."
29:48;29:51;"And Slim Jim already had a great phrase."
29:51;29:54;"They already had a great advertising campaign."
29:54;29:55;"Snap into a Slim Jim."
29:55;29:57;"You're not going to beat that."
29:57;30:00;"I guess there's also something interesting that because their portfolio is pretty"
30:00;30:03;"rando, I think they're also probably--I can imagine people sitting around"
30:03;30:05;"and they're like, ""Who are we?"
30:05;30:06;"We got Slim Jim."
30:06;30:07;"We got David."
30:07;30:08;"We got Crunch and Munch."
30:08;30:10;"We're not really a candy company."""
30:10;30:11;"No, no, no."
30:11;30:12;"No, sir."
30:12;30:13;"You're not Mars."
30:13;30:14;"You're not the M&M company."
30:14;30:16;"Are we going head-to-head with Frito-Lay?"
30:16;30:17;"The big boys?"
30:17;30:18;"Oh, no."
30:18;30:19;"We would get crushed by Frito-Lay."
30:19;30:20;"You're not in the same league."
30:20;30:21;"They own chips."
30:21;30:22;"So you're not chips."
30:22;30:23;"You're not candy."
30:23;30:24;"What are you?"
30:24;30:25;"You're not cookies."
30:25;30:26;"You're not sweet."
30:26;30:27;"We're something different."
30:27;30:30;"We're that weird catch-all snack category."
30:30;30:34;"We're basically things that are kind of difficult to eat."
30:34;30:40;"Like Slim Jim, very kind of hard, dense, brittle beef jerky,"
30:40;30:42;"and then Sunflower Seed, which you like."
30:42;30:43;"Nobody wants that."
30:43;30:45;"You suck on the Sunflower Seed."
30:45;30:48;"And then Crunch and Munch is all up in your teeth."
30:48;30:50;"It's like borderline inedible snacks."
30:50;30:53;"So anyway, I'm watching this weird-ass commercial, and I'm like,"
30:53;30:58;"""Who the hell is this mystery company that owns this random-ass portfolio?"""
30:58;31:00;"Turns out it's ConAgra Brands."
31:00;31:01;"Heard of it."
31:01;31:05;"A North American packaged food company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois."
31:05;31:07;"ConAgra was founded in 1919."
31:07;31:10;"I know this is about to sound like some cat-choggy."
31:10;31:14;"ConAgra was founded in 1919 by Frank Little and Alva Kinney,"
31:14;31:19;"who brought together four grain mills as Nebraska Consolidated Mills."
31:19;31:22;"This is a totally ""This Show Rules"" moment."
31:22;31:24;"Oh, this is deeply ""This Show Rules."""
31:24;31:28;"I was just reading the ConAgra Wikipedia page."
31:28;31:31;"It's a lot of big names that ConAgra owns."
31:31;31:35;"They own Act 2, microwave popcorn, Andy Capp's Fries."
31:35;31:37;"I thought that was a comic strip."
31:37;31:40;"No, it is. Andy Capp was, but Andy Capp's Fries is definitely"
31:40;31:42;"like a kind of third-tier vending machine item."
31:42;31:43;"Like frozen French fries?"
31:43;31:47;"No, it's a flavored corn and potato snack made to look like French fries,"
31:47;31:48;"but you eat it. It's in a bag."
31:48;31:49;"Okay, not familiar."
31:49;31:50;"Chef Boyardee."
31:50;31:51;"Okay, that's big."
31:51;31:52;"That's big."
31:52;31:54;"I see they have Aunt Jemima."
31:54;31:56;"Chun King Chinese-style foods."
31:56;31:59;"It's an American line of canned Chinese food products"
31:59;32:03;"founded in the 1940s by Gino Paolucci."
32:03;32:07;"That's a film right there."
32:07;32:10;"You got an Italian guy in Brooklyn"
32:10;32:13;"feeling like, ""This Chinese food, let me tell you."""
32:13;32:14;"Yeah."
32:14;32:17;"Anyway, it's changed hands quite a few times,"
32:17;32:19;"but now it's owned by ConAgra."
32:19;32:20;"What else have these guys got?"
32:20;32:22;"They got Manwich, they got Marie Callender's."
32:22;32:25;"It says here they got Fiddle, Faddle, and Crunch 'n Munch,"
32:25;32:29;"both of which are described as glazed popcorn/nut mixture."
32:29;32:30;"They got two?"
32:30;32:32;"We got to get in touch with the government, man."
32:32;32:34;"That's a monopoly."
32:34;32:37;"Yeah, but Cracker Jack is the big dog in that field,"
32:37;32:39;"so I guess they're like--"
32:39;32:41;"Distant second and third."
32:41;32:43;"How are we going to take on Cracker Jack?"
32:43;32:44;"Consolidate, dog."
32:44;32:48;"Fiddle, Faddle, what do you say we put this beef aside and team up?"
32:48;32:50;"You got it, Crunch 'n Munch."
32:50;32:52;"They also own Hebrew National Hot Dogs."
32:52;32:53;"Their portfolio is fascinating."
32:53;32:56;"Fiddle, Faddle, let's face it, the writing's on the wall."
32:56;32:59;"Cracker Jack's just running away, man."
32:59;33:01;"It's like when Adidas bought Reebok."
33:01;33:02;"They did?"
33:02;33:04;"Yes, years ago."
33:04;33:06;"They're trying to gain on Nike, and I think it worked."
33:06;33:09;"They own Pam Cooking Oil."
33:09;33:11;"Peter Pan Peanut Butter."
33:11;33:13;"They own Poppycock."
33:13;33:15;"I'll give you one guess what that is."
33:15;33:18;"It's a premium glazed popcorn/nut mixture."
33:18;33:22;"They got three glazed popcorn/nut mixtures?"
33:22;33:24;"They own Swiss Miss."
33:24;33:25;"That's pretty major."
33:25;33:27;"So basically there's big names,"
33:27;33:31;"but it's truly an alliance of rando items."
33:31;33:33;"It's an interesting strategy because they're playing the margins."
33:33;33:38;"They're buying the second, third, fourth level competitors"
33:38;33:41;"in each category."
33:41;33:43;"They didn't buy Nestle Quick."
33:43;33:44;"Quick's don't buy Nestle."
33:44;33:45;"You can't buy Nestle."
33:45;33:46;"You can't buy Quick."
33:46;33:48;"They bought Swiss Miss."
33:48;33:50;"I guess they're just playing the margins."
33:50;33:52;"Or it's some Billy Bean stuff."
33:52;33:54;"Yes, it's very Moneyball."
33:54;33:55;"Very Moneyball."
33:55;33:58;"You look for the stuff that is undervalued."
33:58;34:01;"The guy that only hits 270,"
34:01;34:03;"but his on-base percentage is like 370."
34:03;34:04;"He walks a lot."
34:04;34:05;"What does he do?"
34:05;34:06;"He gets on base."
34:06;34:07;"What does Swiss Miss do?"
34:07;34:08;"They get on base."
34:08;34:09;"You know what's funny?"
34:09;34:10;"That's hilarious."
34:10;34:13;"Recently I was just clicking around on YouTube,"
34:13;34:17;"and one of the suggested things to watch was a scene from Moneyball."
34:17;34:19;"I was like, ""I like that movie. I'll watch it."""
34:19;34:23;"It was the scene where Brad Pitt is kind of bringing Jonah Hill"
34:23;34:25;"into the room for the first time,"
34:25;34:27;"and he's there with all the old school guys,"
34:27;34:29;"and he's basically saying the new strategy."
34:29;34:31;"These guys are pushing back,"
34:31;34:34;"but it's a great scene to explain what the new strategy is."
34:34;34:36;"He's kind of saying, ""We're going to get this guy."""
34:36;34:38;"They're like, ""Oh, but that guy can barely run."
34:38;34:40;"That guy's not that good. He flops."""
34:40;34:41;"Yeah, he's 37 years old."
34:41;34:43;"Then he's like, ""He only bats 270."""
34:43;34:45;"He's like, ""That's all we need."""
34:45;34:47;"They're like, ""Yeah, but Red Sox are trying to get rid of him."""
34:47;34:49;"He's like, ""Exactly, so we can get him for cheap."""
34:49;34:52;"He's explaining, ""We buy players for cheap"
34:52;34:54;"who are just good enough for what we need."""
34:54;34:56;"They're like, ""But where's our superstar?"""
34:56;34:58;"""You don't need a superstar."""
34:58;35:00;"""You're totally right."" Swiss Miss gets on base."
35:00;35:04;"ConAgra is the Billy Bean of the snack food stew."
35:04;35:07;"Snack ball. We got to write snack ball."
35:07;35:08;"[laughter]"
35:08;35:09;"That would rule!"
35:09;35:10;"Just like sitting there."
35:10;35:12;"It's like the ConAgra film."
35:12;35:13;"[laughter]"
35:13;35:15;"Just like a civil war in ConAgra,"
35:15;35:18;"somebody's like, ""We finally have enough money to buy Snickers."
35:18;35:20;"We're betting big on Snickers."""
35:20;35:21;"Nope."
35:21;35:22;"""No, we are not."""
35:22;35:23;"We're passing."
35:23;35:25;"""What are you talking about? It's a prestige brand."""
35:25;35:27;"""We don't need a prestige brand."""
35:27;35:29;"""Well, what do you suggest we buy?"""
35:29;35:30;"Fiddle faddle."
35:30;35:32;"♪ I'm hungry, I want something to eat ♪"
35:32;35:35;"♪ Something with a crunch and very sweet ♪"
35:35;35:37;"♪ Just woke up so you know the scenario ♪"
35:37;35:39;"♪ I'm craving cereal like Cheerio ♪"
35:39;35:42;"♪ Maybe Frosted Flakes, I might munch ♪"
35:42;35:44;"♪ But what popped in my mind is Captain Crunch ♪"
35:44;35:46;"♪ So I went to the kitchen to pick my choice ♪"
35:46;35:50;"♪ In my stomach, I heard a voice that said, ""Please feed me"" ♪"
35:50;35:52;"♪ My tank is on empty, I'm seeing things ♪"
35:52;35:54;"♪ So please don't test me ♪"
35:54;35:56;"♪ So I said, ""Okay,"" and got my bowl ♪"
35:56;35:59;"♪ Got my milk and cereal, make sure it was cold ♪"
35:59;36:01;"♪ Sat down at the table and said my grace ♪"
36:01;36:03;"♪ Because I knew what's about to take place ♪"
36:03;36:05;"♪ Yum yum, eat 'em up, my belly's set ♪"
36:05;36:08;"♪ The crunch was so loud, everybody thought that they bit ♪"
36:08;36:10;"♪ Eat 'em all, let's go, let's go ♪"

36:13;36:15;"♪ Do the move, do I move, they push ♪"
36:15;36:18;"♪ Oh, so they can catch ♪"
36:18;36:21;"So anyway, the ConAgra brand is unbelievable."
36:21;36:23;"I love this money ball analogy."
36:23;36:28;"But I was kind of thinking, based on the Snack King division,"
36:28;36:31;"if they want to brand their snack division so bad"
36:31;36:35;"and they want to own their weird kind of like second tier snack universe,"
36:35;36:37;"I think they should make a cinematic universe."
36:37;36:39;"And I was kind of thinking about it,"
36:39;36:42;"that the ConAgra cinematic universe"
36:42;36:46;"is so much more interesting than the General Mills monsterverse."
36:46;36:48;"Because first of all, General Mills--"
36:48;36:50;"I also got to say, I guess I wasn't clear enough"
36:50;36:53;"about what I think about the General Mills strategy."
36:53;36:55;"I think it's whack!"
36:55;36:56;"And here's why."
36:56;36:59;"Not because I don't respect General Mills, which I do."
36:59;37:00;"I do respect General Mills,"
37:00;37:03;"but they're not even picking the interesting General Mills cereals."
37:03;37:06;"Like, turn Cheerios into a character. That'd be cool."
37:06;37:10;"Instead, they're picking this dumb mix of fake monsters."
37:10;37:14;"First of all, Universal already tried to do a monsterverse"
37:14;37:18;"using their old IP, like Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, The Mummy."
37:18;37:19;"And that barely worked."
37:19;37:21;"We barely want to see Dracula, let alone Count Chocula."
37:21;37:24;"We barely want to see Frankenstein, let alone Frankenberry."
37:24;37:26;"So already, it's a copy of a copy."
37:26;37:27;"You know what I'm saying?"
37:27;37:29;"Like, it's not original."
37:29;37:32;"Whereas, I would say that the ConAgra cinematic universe"
37:32;37:33;"has a lot more potential."
37:33;37:35;"The thing that caught me is that the big three brands"
37:35;37:38;"they're trying to promote here are Slim Jim,"
37:38;37:40;"David Sunflower Seeds, and Crunch 'N Munch."
37:40;37:44;"Now the first two, I think we could have a lot of fun casting it."
37:44;37:46;"Oh, the Slim Jim movie would be amazing."
37:46;37:48;"You'd turn it into a guy."
37:48;37:51;"He's an all-American, kind of tall, skinny guy."
37:51;37:54;"Maybe a Sam Elliott. He could be a Slim Jim."
37:54;37:55;"Like a cowboy. It's a western."
37:55;37:59;"Yeah, and then David Sunflower Seeds, maybe like a kind of nerdy guy."
37:59;38:02;"Maybe, you know, he's the brains of the operation."
38:02;38:04;"And then Crunch, I don't know who Crunch 'N Munch is,"
38:04;38:05;"but you know what I'm saying?"
38:05;38:07;"Like, that's interesting."
38:07;38:11;"That is going to attract a higher caliber of writer talent,"
38:11;38:14;"because you're not just saying, ""Hey guys, we want to make a stupid movie"
38:14;38:18;"about a fake Frankenstein."" That's undignified."
38:18;38:21;"The ConAgra brand, there's something scrappy about it."
38:21;38:23;"You know, there's some good energy there that I like."
38:23;38:24;"Wide open."
38:24;38:25;"Yeah."
38:25;38:27;"The Coen brothers could do a Slim Jim movie."
38:27;38:28;"Oh yeah, they could crush it."
38:28;38:29;"I mean, they just made that--"
38:29;38:30;"Ballad of Buster Scruggs?"
38:30;38:31;"Yeah."
38:32;38:33;"A compilation of western shorts."
38:33;38:36;"They could have cut that last one and done a Slim Jim one."
38:36;38:38;"Do you remember there was a movie in the '80s--"
38:38;38:40;"I never actually saw it, but I remember always seeing it at the video store."
38:40;38:44;"That was called Harley Davidson Meets the Marlboro Man."
38:44;38:45;"No."
38:45;38:47;"It's a feature film where--"
38:47;38:48;"Wow."
38:48;38:52;"--two all-American brands, who often are marketed to the same type of person,"
38:52;38:55;"Harley Davidson Motorcycles and Marlboro Cigarettes, became people."
38:55;38:58;"The Marlboro Man was already kind of in the ads."
38:58;39:00;"So Harley Davidson is like a badass biker,"
39:00;39:04;"and then Marlboro Man is like a badass cowboy cigarette smoker,"
39:04;39:07;"and I don't know what happens in the movie, but maybe they're enemies,"
39:07;39:09;"and then they have to team up and go on an adventure."
39:09;39:12;"That sounds like such a video art piece at MoMA."
39:12;39:13;"Yeah."
39:13;39:14;"Harley Davidson--"
39:14;39:17;"Like, let's challenge notions of American masculinity."
39:17;39:18;"Right."
39:18;39:20;"There's an all-star cast in that film."
39:20;39:21;"Who's in it?"
39:21;39:22;"Mickey Rourke and Don Johnson."
39:22;39:23;"Oh, jeez."
39:23;39:24;"Oh, wow."
39:24;39:25;"Serious."
39:25;39:27;"Also Tom Sizemore and Vanessa Williams."
39:27;39:28;"And that got a theatrical release?"
39:28;39:29;"How did it do?"
39:29;39:32;"It did get a theatrical release in 1991."
39:32;39:34;"Oh, it was in the '90s?"
39:34;39:37;"It earned $7 million at the box office, budget of $23 million."
39:37;39:38;"Ouch."
39:38;39:39;"Oh, that's not great."
39:39;39:44;"Looks like there was a character called Jack Daniels also in it."
39:44;39:46;"And Daniel Baldwin was also in the film."
39:46;39:49;"That's tight, but it's such, like, video art."
39:49;39:53;"I love that someone lost, like, $16 million on that."
39:53;39:54;"On Harley--"
39:54;39:57;"Well, who knows, maybe they made it up with the video sales."
39:57;39:58;"Maybe."
39:58;40:00;"Maybe they're turning a profit by now."
40:00;40:03;"Anyway, if they can make a Harley Davidson meets a Marlboro Man movie,"
40:03;40:07;"at least we could do a Slim Jim meets David Sunflower."
40:07;40:08;"We're lining up for that."
40:11;40:14;"[singing]"
40:22;40:30;"[singing]"

41:16;41:20;"[singing]"
41:20;41:25;"[singing]"
41:35;41:38;"All right, we got some great guests on this week's episode."
41:38;41:40;"First, we got Vic Berger."
41:40;41:43;"Now, Seinfeld, you and Vic Berger used to be colleagues?"
41:43;41:47;"Yeah, and, you know, we were kind of-- how can I put it?"
41:47;41:50;"I was just kind of the point person for Vic."
41:50;41:54;"I can't really take any credit for his brilliance, but he's just an amazing editor."
41:54;41:57;"You're both great editors who make funny videos."
41:57;41:59;"I mean, how do you even describe Vic?"
41:59;42:06;"I mean, he's an absurdist editor, and he has a real knack for observing things that other people may not."
42:06;42:13;"So he can watch something and spot somebody in a crowd doing something really unusual in a crowd of 100 people"
42:13;42:16;"and, you know, construct a narrative about them."
42:16;42:17;"Zoom in on it."
42:17;42:21;"I mean, I followed Vic on the various social media formats for a few years,"
42:21;42:27;"and I always thought he was very funny, but it was in the 2016 election he really took it to the next level."
42:27;42:33;"There's a video that he made that was kind of some of Jeb Bush's greatest hits on the campaign trail."
42:33;42:38;"I must have watched that 20 times, where it's kind of like all these sad Jeb Bush moments,"
42:38;42:42;"then he keeps having Trump over and over again go, ""Jeb is a mess."""
42:42;42:43;"Jeb is a mess."
42:43;42:47;"And then just Jeb going, ""Please clap,"" and all, like, the kind of classics,"
42:47;42:55;"and he puts it together in this kind of absurdist, spooky, post-hymenaric, gorgeous video."
42:55;42:57;"It's very unnerving."
42:57;43:03;"The people of Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina have spoken, and I really respect their decision."
43:03;43:06;"So tonight I am suspending my campaign."
43:06;43:08;"Yeah, yeah."
43:08;43:20;"But no matter what the future holds, here's the greatest safety landing, if you can imagine."
43:20;43:24;"Tonight I'm going to sleep with the best friend I have and the love of my life."
43:24;43:29;"But anyway, Vic, he's not just a comedian/absurdist editor."
43:29;43:33;"He's also a musician, and he's dropping an album out December 14th,"
43:33;43:35;"so we're going to get him on the phone, chop it up with Vic,"
43:35;43:38;"and we're going to play a song from his forthcoming album."
43:38;43:42;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
43:42;43:46;"Hello?"
43:46;43:49;"Hey Vic, how are you doing? This is Ezra and Jake from Time Crisis."
43:49;43:50;"Hey, how's it going?"
43:50;43:53;"And don't forget about Seinfeld 2000, but you already know him."
43:53;43:54;"Oh yeah, oh I know him."
43:54;43:55;"Hey Vic."
43:55;43:57;"Very well. Hey, how you doing man?"
43:57;43:58;"I'm good."
43:58;44:02;"So Vic, I imagine probably a lot of TC heads are acquainted with your work."
44:02;44:05;"We were trying to figure out, how do you describe yourself?"
44:05;44:07;"When you're talking to some kind of random person, what do you say?"
44:07;44:09;"Right, that's a tough question."
44:09;44:14;"I mean, I'm a weirdo, you know, so I have weird tendencies,"
44:14;44:19;"and sometimes I don't always know how to properly get them across,"
44:19;44:25;"so I kind of delve into the arts and music, and now video editing,"
44:25;44:28;"because I've been doing this about four years now, three and a half years,"
44:28;44:32;"and that's my preferred way of expressing myself."
44:32;44:37;"So I guess I kind of say I'm an artist, but I focus on video,"
44:37;44:44;"and I repurpose a lot of footage that exists already to comment on things"
44:44;44:48;"or just to make something that's funny to me."
44:48;44:52;"I was just saying that your kind of Jeb Bush wrap-up"
44:52;44:54;"is one of my favorite videos of all time."
44:54;44:55;"Awesome, thank you."
44:55;44:59;"It's like weird. It's like every time somebody says the word ""mess,"""
44:59;45:02;"you know how everybody has some weird reference or something?"
45:02;45:04;"It's like just be like at home, and somebody would be like,"
45:04;45:06;"""Whoa, the kitchen's a mess,"" and I'll just like, to no one in particular,"
45:06;45:09;"be like, ""Jeb is a mess."""
45:09;45:16;"Which obviously Trump said, but you zeroed in on and turned it into something special."
45:16;45:19;"One little tidbit is he never actually said that."
45:19;45:23;"What?"
45:23;45:25;"I spliced that together, yeah."
45:25;45:26;"What did he actually say?"
45:26;45:29;"I think he was just saying our country's a mess,"
45:29;45:34;"just how bad Obama was doing that."
45:34;45:38;"Okay, so you did make Jeb--you really made Jeb--not only--okay."
45:38;45:40;"Yes, yes."
45:40;45:44;"So we're curious about your new album because I noticed the title is"
45:44;45:49;"""The Cabinet's in the Cupboard,"" and then in parentheses, ""2000 to 2012."""
45:49;45:53;"Now, if in fact these recordings are not from 2000 to 2012,"
45:53;45:55;"that would be very fascinating."
45:55;45:56;"Yes, that would be absurd."
45:56;45:57;"I have a feeling they are."
45:57;45:59;"What's the backstory?"
45:59;46:04;"Well, since middle school, high school, I always wanted to go into music"
46:04;46:08;"and basically be like a Brian Wilson or something like that,"
46:08;46:12;"hanging out in the studio all day recording, writing songs, doing all that."
46:12;46:15;"But then I found out that that's very difficult to do,"
46:15;46:20;"and I thought, ""I've got to go to college, so let's go to school for music."""
46:20;46:25;"And so I did that, and I got into songwriting while there."
46:25;46:30;"And from there, I just kind of--I'd be in my bedroom writing"
46:30;46:35;"and recording songs all the time and never really knew how to get them out there."
46:35;46:37;"I'm not very good at self-promotion"
46:37;46:40;"and not a whole lot of confidence in that department."
46:40;46:45;"So I kind of just--maybe a handful of people over the years have heard them,"
46:45;46:48;"and I had maybe a couple hundred songs."
46:48;46:53;"And then as I started to get a little bit known for the video,"
46:53;46:57;"now and then I would put out a song just for people to follow me to check out."
46:57;47:02;"And then Jared Sheik from Philanthrograph Records came across them,"
47:02;47:06;"something I posted, and he said, ""Yeah, you have any more of those songs?"""
47:06;47:10;"And I just sent him everything, and he picked his 12 favorite."
47:10;47:12;"And so that's what it is. It's all stuff."
47:12;47:18;"There's a song in there I recorded when I was 17 in my high school auditorium."
47:18;47:21;"And there's a lot of more personal stuff,"
47:21;47:25;"some stuff I wrote and recorded for my wife when we first met."
47:25;47:28;"So that's kind of a more personal thing."
47:28;47:33;"Right, so it's a compilation, but it's also kind of your debut album in a way."
47:33;47:38;"Yes, yeah, yeah. Stuff that's been on the shelf for a very long time."
47:38;47:40;"But yeah, first release ever."
47:40;47:44;"Okay, great. Well, we're going to play track 2 from The Cabinets in the Cupboard."
47:44;47:46;"This one's called ""Every Time I Get Close to You."""
47:46;47:49;"When in the 2000-2012 range is this song from?"
47:49;47:54;"This is from 2007, so when I was at the time living in Jersey City."
47:54;47:56;"You live in Jersey City?"
47:56;48:02;"I did for about three months when my wife was going to NYU for her master's."
48:02;48:04;"And we lived there for a little bit."
48:04;48:07;"Spent a lot of time on the Pathtrend Journal Square?"
48:07;48:09;"Yes. Oh yeah."
48:09;48:12;"I love it. All right, here's ""Every Time I Get Close to You."""
48:12;48:19;"Your voice is poison, but I listen with full attention"
48:19;48:26;"You speak so softly, yet you hurt me with every word"
48:26;48:34;"You try to push me away, and I get it with full apprehension"
48:34;48:41;"Something's driving me near to you"
48:41;48:48;"Every time I get close to you, am I supposed to feel this way?"
48:48;48:53;"'Cause every time I get close, your face just looks like home"
48:54;49:03;"Every time I get close to you, how am I supposed to talk to you?"
49:03;49:09;"If every time I'm near you, your face just says no way"
49:09;49:18;"The quicker you leave, the sooner I need to find you"
49:18;49:25;"You don't hide well, because I'm following right behind you"
49:25;49:32;"The more you say no, the more I will try to convert you"
49:32;49:38;"To wanting to be with me, be with me"
49:38;49:47;"Every time I get close to you, am I supposed to feel this way?"
49:47;49:52;"'Cause every time I get close, your face just looks like home"
49:52;50:04;"Every time I get close to you, how am I supposed to talk to you?"
50:04;50:09;"If every time I'm near you, your face just says no way"
50:12;50:18;"It's never enough to just think of you"
50:18;50:26;"I know we would make a good pair, do you like keeping me in despair?"
50:26;50:33;"Every time I get close to you, am I supposed to feel this way?"
50:33;50:38;"'Cause every time I get close, your face just looks like home"
50:39;50:49;"Every time I get close to you, how am I supposed to talk to you?"
50:49;50:54;"If every time I'm near you, your face just says no way"
50:54;51:02;"Every time I get close to you"
51:03;51:06;"La da da da da da da"
51:06;51:19;"Every time I get close to you"
51:31;51:34;"Great song from Vic Berger, Every Time I Get Close to You."
51:34;51:37;"Vic, last question for you. What's going on?"
51:37;51:38;"What's going on?"
51:38;51:45;"In the world today, I mean you're somebody who lives at the intersection of art, politics, funny s***, serious s***."
51:45;51:49;"What's going on? It's almost the end of the year. Are things looking up for 2019?"
51:49;51:55;"I am, I'm actually positive. I think all the negative, hateful stuff that has been uncovered,"
51:55;52:02;"the sunlight is shining on it, it's shining on down, and I think things are going to be looking up from the new year on."
52:02;52:06;"I just feel, I mean it can't get worse, can it? I mean, can it get much worse than that?"
52:06;52:10;"I think we're going to be on the way up here. That's my prediction."
52:10;52:13;"I agree. The power of positive thinking."
52:13;52:17;"Alright, well thanks so much for calling in Vic, and I hope to meet you in person sometime soon."
52:17;52:18;"Yeah, definitely, definitely."
52:18;52:19;"Alright, have a good one man."
52:19;52:20;"Alright, thanks guys."
52:20;52:21;"Alright, bye."
52:21;52:22;"Thanks Vic."
52:22;52:23;"Bye."
52:23;52:27;"This is graphic designer Andrew Smith, creator of the Joker Man font."
52:27;52:31;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
52:31;52:35;"Hello?"
52:35;52:36;"Is that Andrew?"
52:36;52:37;"Yes it is."
52:37;52:40;"Hi Andrew, you're on Time Crisis with Ezra, Jake, and Seinfeld2000."
52:40;52:41;"Hi, how are you?"
52:41;52:45;"We're great, thank you so much for taking the time to call in."
52:45;52:46;"That's alright."
52:46;52:48;"We have so many questions, I don't even know where to begin."
52:48;52:51;"I mean, so first of all, what's the best way to describe you?"
52:51;52:58;"You're a graphic designer who also creates typefaces, or is there a specific word for somebody who makes fonts and typefaces?"
52:58;53:04;"Yeah, I suppose you could say, yeah I am a graphic designer, but a typographer as well I suppose you could call me."
53:04;53:06;"You know, type designer."
53:06;53:09;"Okay, so you're a type designer and graphic designer."
53:09;53:15;"Okay, so the first question I've got to ask, because even right here on my notes we wrote Joker Man font,"
53:15;53:19;"we've been talking about Joker Man quite a bit on the show,"
53:19;53:27;"and I've noticed that it rubs some people the wrong way because there's a debate about whether you call it a font or a typeface,"
53:27;53:33;"and I think the Joe Schmo on the street, Joe Sixpack, has decided that font and typeface mean the same thing,"
53:33;53:35;"and I'll admit, I am a Joe Schmo."
53:35;53:40;"But for someone like you, can we call Joker Man a font, or is it a typeface?"
53:40;53:46;"I'd say they're the same thing, aren't they? I mean, I don't understand why people are calling them two different things."
53:46;53:52;"Thank you. You heard it here. Andrew Smith has laid down the law. Fonts and typefaces are the same."
53:52;53:57;"I mean, I looked it up, of course, when I started getting these messages where people were kind of saying like,"
53:57;54:00;"""What's the matter with you, man? It's not a font, it's a typeface."""
54:00;54:06;"And it seemed like there used to be a distinction when people were literally laying letters into a printing press."
54:06;54:10;"Yeah, that's probably where the font side of things comes from, doesn't it?"
54:10;54:17;"So, I mean, the term typeface is probably more for computers and the digital side of things,"
54:17;54:22;"and that's probably where that's sort of come from in the last 20 years or so."
54:22;54:29;"One thing that's interesting about Joker Man is everybody knows this font, but not everybody knows the name."
54:29;54:34;"Like, I've been pointing out examples of it, and then suddenly everybody, all my Instagram followers,"
54:34;54:39;"now they're seeing it everywhere. It's like you learn the language, and now you see it everywhere."
54:39;54:45;"Because here in LA, I saw ""barbershop,"" the sign was in Joker Man. So it's a very influential font."
54:45;54:48;"And so is it named after the Bob Dylan song, Joker Man?"
54:48;54:49;"Yes, it is."
54:49;54:50;"Oh, that's awesome."
54:50;54:51;"Yes, that's awesome."
54:51;54:56;"I'm a big Bob Dylan fan, and I wanted to pay tribute to him."
54:56;55:03;"And I like the song, and I thought that's quite a funky name, and it goes with the style of the font."
55:03;55:06;"So you're right, it is from the Bob Dylan song."
55:06;55:08;"I'm so happy to have confirmation of that."
55:08;55:09;"That is gratifying."
55:09;55:14;"I also love that song, and my band has been rehearsing a cover of it."
55:14;55:16;"Oh, okay. How's it going?"
55:16;55:21;"It's good. We kind of jammed it out. I mean, it's already a six-minute song. We have an 11-minute version."
55:21;55:22;"Wow."
55:22;55:25;"11-minute Joker Man. But I think it's one of his best songs of the '80s."
55:25;55:26;"Definitely, yeah."
55:26;55:37;"Standing on the water, casting your breath While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing"
55:37;55:43;"Distant ship sailing into the mist You were born with a snake in both of your fists"
55:43;55:47;"While a hurricane was blowing"
55:47;55:54;"Freedom just around the corner from you"
55:54;56:01;"You retreat so far off, what good will it do?"
56:01;56:08;"Joker Man, dance through the night and get Put fire high by the light of the moon"
56:08;56:13;"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Joker Man"
56:13;56:21;"Okay, so it's 1995. You're creating this font, Joker Man. Are you making it for Microsoft?"
56:21;56:26;"Oh, no, no. We're not making it for Microsoft, no. Have you heard of Letraset?"
56:26;56:27;"Sounds familiar. I'm not sure what that is."
56:27;56:35;"It was a big company in the '60s and '70s and '80s. They used to make dry transfer lettering."
56:35;56:42;"So back in the old days before computers, if you wanted to design a layout, you'd buy your dry transfer lettering,"
56:42;56:48;"and you'd have to rub down the letters and space it out. So I worked for this company, Letraset."
56:48;56:53;"I worked in the type studio, and we digitized fonts and we designed fonts."
56:53;57:01;"So that's where I sort of learned my craft, and that's how I started to design fonts, typefaces."
57:01;57:05;"Can you paint a picture for us? At that point, 1995, you're making Joker Man."
57:05;57:08;"Are you thinking about how this font's going to be used?"
57:08;57:12;"Are you seeing a hole in the marketplace that you're trying to fill with this font?"
57:12;57:15;"Did you have like an ethos going into the creation of it?"
57:15;57:19;"I wasn't thinking how people were going to use it or anything like that."
57:19;57:27;"It was more about, I suppose in those days, you know, the more creative, crazier type of wackier fonts."
57:27;57:29;"There weren't a lot of those around."
57:29;57:35;"So, you know, people were starting to do these sort of more creative typefaces."
57:35;57:38;"So that was sort of where it sort of stemmed from."
57:38;57:42;"I didn't have an ethos, as you say. I just came up with an idea."
57:42;57:48;"It wasn't influenced by anything. It was just, I just thought of it."
57:48;57:54;"It's interesting because we were talking before, like Joker Man, when you see the font used, people have been sending me examples."
57:54;57:57;"It's like so many different types of things. It can be..."
57:57;57:59;"Well, what's it being used on then? What have you found?"
57:59;58:05;"Well, like I said, in L.A., there's a barber shop in Hollywood that uses Joker Man."
58:05;58:13;"I've definitely seen it used occasionally with stores and things related to like children, like a toy shop."
58:13;58:16;"Because I think there's a kind of whimsical nature to Joker Man."
58:16;58:20;"We saw that, you know, there's this festival in the U.S. called Burning Man."
58:20;58:22;"No, I don't know about that."
58:22;58:28;"It's kind of, how do you describe it? It's a big techno hippie utopian festival out in the desert."
58:28;58:29;"Right."
58:29;58:34;"Which is very popular now. And they build a giant man. They burn it at the end of every festival, every year."
58:34;58:35;"Okay."
58:35;58:44;"And somebody sent us a picture that one year, they put the ashes of the 2001 Burning Man in a jar that the founders of the festival keep somewhere."
58:44;58:46;"And the jar was labeled in Joker Man."
58:46;58:50;"So, you know, that's this kind of techno utopian hippie festival."
58:50;58:55;"And they chose Joker Man, at least in one small way, to represent the festival."
58:55;59:03;"So if I had to say some of the repeated types of places, I'd say things related to childhood and fun and toys."
59:03;59:05;"And definitely coffee shops, too."
59:05;59:10;"I've even seen Joker Man referred to as part of a larger set of fonts called Global Coffeehouse,"
59:10;59:14;"which reminds people of kind of like a 90s coffeehouse vibe."
59:14;59:19;"So I'm curious, when you hear about these different things, as the creator of the font itself, do these resonate with you at all?"
59:19;59:23;"You're just kind of like, that's interesting. People are going to do what they do. Does it make sense to you?"
59:23;59:28;"Sort of. I mean, how people want to use the typeface is up to them."
59:28;59:30;"If they think it works, I mean, that's fine with me."
59:30;59:38;"But I mean, some of those sound a bit, I never envisaged that it would be used for some of the things you just mentioned."
59:38;59:43;"Right. As I was kind of looking through your font portfolio, I was also interested to see that Joker Man,"
59:43;59:50;"I've even occasionally been seeing kind of knockoffs, and then I kind of had to go check and I was like, oh, wait, that's not actually Joker Man."
59:50;59:57;"But there's kind of a lot of similar fonts, and one of which, not a knockoff, but one that you created, that's almost like a sister font, is Laughing."
59:57;59:59;"Right, yeah."
59:59;01:00:01;"How are those fonts related to you?"
01:00:01;01:00:10;"Yeah, they're quite similar, I suppose. That one's not as popular as Joker Man, so I prefer Joker Man, maybe because it was the one I did first."
01:00:10;01:00:12;"Oh, so that's the original."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"Yeah."
01:00:13;01:00:17;"They both have this kind of motif of dots to the side of certain letters?"
01:00:17;01:00:26;"Yeah. There's no theory with that. It's just what's come out on the page, you know, so I wouldn't read too deeply into the two of them."
01:00:26;01:00:29;"I've already written a few hundred pages of my thesis."
01:00:29;01:00:30;"Have you?"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"I am curious about the relationship. I mean, I'm also curious--"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"Are you doing the thesis on this or something?"
01:00:34;01:00:41;"No, no. Somebody suggested to me that somebody should make a book of Joker Man called Joker Man Wild."
01:00:41;01:00:45;"I forget who did it. It's such a good name. I forget it was somebody on the internet."
01:00:45;01:00:53;"Joker Man Wild, which would be a coffee table book of Joker Man font in the wild, you know, like on signs and things like that."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"Wow."
01:00:54;01:00:59;"We need your permission for that. But one question I have, is Joker Man your most popular font you've been a part of?"
01:00:59;01:01:03;"Because as I look through your portfolio, I definitely see a lot of familiar faces."
01:01:03;01:01:09;"I know Smudge has done quite well. That's a sort of a brush script font I've done."
01:01:09;01:01:14;"And also my John Lennon font, Goo Goo Gajoob. Have you seen that one?"
01:01:14;01:01:19;"Well, I noticed that, so I guess that you have at least two fonts that are indebted to songs."
01:01:19;01:01:23;"Yeah, I mean, I am working on a Dylan font at the moment as well, actually."
01:01:23;01:01:24;"Oh, really?"
01:01:24;01:01:29;"Yeah, but I've only just started thinking of that at the moment. So I'll keep you posted."
01:01:29;01:01:35;"Oh, yeah, we'd love to see that. And one that also jumped out to me, which was very familiar to me, Chiller."
01:01:35;01:01:41;"It's kind of a slightly spooky handwritten font. But then you look at it and you're like, but it's very specific."
01:01:41;01:01:46;"There's a lot of things that could be like that. And yet that's the one, you know, so Chiller seems very popular to me."
01:01:46;01:01:54;"Yeah, that is. And the reason I called it Chiller, because I happened to be watching a Hitchcock film at the time when I was working on it."
01:01:54;01:02:05;"So I just thought Chiller was quite a nice name. And because it's called Chiller, I think it lends people to use it for the more sort of horror type applications."
01:02:05;01:02:12;"Oh, yeah, that's interesting. If you hadn't called it Chiller. Yeah, because as soon as I see it and you see it written out in the word Chiller, you say, think it's spooky."
01:02:12;01:02:24;"But if you had called that one Sonny, yeah, who knows? I mean, the names of fonts, you know, or typefaces, it does sort of psychologically affect how they get used."
01:02:24;01:02:33;"And obviously the name helps, you know, like people are looking for a horror font, then, you know, something called Chiller would come up in a search or something."
01:02:33;01:02:38;"So that does influence people's sort of use of them, if you see what I mean."
01:02:38;01:02:46;"No, totally. It's like if Joker Man had been called like New Jersey, people would have had very different associations with it."
01:02:46;01:02:58;"I am here as you are here as you are me and we are all together."
01:02:58;01:03:04;"See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly."
01:03:04;01:03:15;"I'm crying, sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come."
01:03:15;01:03:34;"I am the Eggman, they are the Eggman. I am the Walrus."
01:03:34;01:03:41;"One thing we're talking about, maybe you I don't know, unless I'm listening to the song Joker Man was, but it's a very mysterious song."
01:03:41;01:03:46;"And I would say it's a mysterious font as well. What is the phrase Joker Man connote to you?"
01:03:46;01:03:51;"And I understand the font. You know, that's something you made that goes out to the world and they use it how they want to."
01:03:51;01:03:55;"But can you take us back before it was a font like and you heard the song Joker Man?"
01:03:55;01:04:00;"It is such a mysterious phrase. And actually, I checked. I was curious about what are the roots of this phrase Joker Man?"
01:04:00;01:04:04;"Because we all know there's a Joker and we know what man means. Joker Man, it seems natural."
01:04:04;01:04:09;"Like for all I know, Joker Man is, you know, a figure that you'd find in history books."
01:04:09;01:04:13;"And I did that Google book search where you can search like 19th century, 20th century."
01:04:13;01:04:23;"And until the Dylan song, the phrase Joker Man, you barely find, you know, occasionally you'll find somebody says Joker, comma man,"
01:04:23;01:04:27;"or, you know, once or twice Joker Man, like as if it was somebody's name or something."
01:04:27;01:04:33;"But the character of Joker Man didn't really exist until the Dylan song."
01:04:33;01:04:36;"So we talked on this show about like what do we think Joker Man is?"
01:04:36;01:04:40;"I have a theory that it's a Joker plus Batman representing the duality of man."
01:04:40;01:04:44;"Well, I'm curious, do you have an interpretation of this figure of the Joker Man?"
01:04:44;01:04:48;"Not really. I mean, it's because I wanted to pay homage to Dylan."
01:04:48;01:04:51;"I just like the name Joker Man and I like the song."
01:04:51;01:04:55;"So I didn't really read too deeply into the meaning of it."
01:04:55;01:05:00;"You've obviously really gone into it quite deeply."
01:05:00;01:05:02;"I have. It's a bit of an obsession, is it?"
01:05:02;01:05:08;"It's a bit of an obsession. This kind of reminds me of there's a part I remember as a kid watching this John Lennon documentary"
01:05:08;01:05:13;"where this American hippie like climbs the wall to his house and John Lennon comes out."
01:05:13;01:05:18;"He's like, what do you want, man? And he just like, well, I was I listened to your record and, you know,"
01:05:18;01:05:22;"I understood the meaning of the song and you were talking to me."
01:05:22;01:05:26;"And John Lennon goes, I wasn't talking to you. I don't even know you. It's just a song."
01:05:26;01:05:30;"And the guy's kind of like, all right, man."
01:05:30;01:05:35;"So you said you're working on a Dylan font. What else are you working on these days outside of fonts?"
01:05:35;01:05:43;"I'm a freelance designer, so that's just a bit of all sorts, really, whatever I can get, you know, in terms of work."
01:05:43;01:05:44;"Are you open to collaboration?"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"In what respect?"
01:05:46;01:05:49;"I don't know. I've got this band Vampire Weekend. We always need some ideas."
01:05:49;01:05:53;"And we actually kind of wanted to do a Joker Man shirt, but maybe we could come up with something together."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"Well, that sounds interesting. Yeah."
01:05:55;01:06:01;"I don't want to put you on the spot, but you might be open to helping us make a font, a Vampire Weekend font."
01:06:01;01:06:03;"Wow. A whole font."
01:06:03;01:06:09;"Well, again, I don't know. I mean, we don't we don't have to start negotiating fees on air, but."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"You've done some drawings, have you?"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"No, I would probably send you."
01:06:12;01:06:13;"You're out of your depth here, bud."
01:06:13;01:06:14;"Well, look, I'm a vibe guy."
01:06:14;01:06:15;"Yeah, I know."
01:06:15;01:06:19;"I would probably send you a series of phrases and maybe a mood board."
01:06:19;01:06:23;"Oh, right. Yeah. And what would be on the mood board then?"
01:06:23;01:06:24;"Maybe some music. I could send you our new album."
01:06:24;01:06:26;"Well, that would be great. Yeah."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"Almost nobody's heard it, but I'd send it to you. Sure."
01:06:28;01:06:36;"Well, Andrew, no matter what, we actually on Time Crisis, we make some shirts and we use Joker Man recently on the back of one of our shirts."
01:06:36;01:06:38;"And thank you very much."
01:06:38;01:06:39;"Everybody's been loving that."
01:06:39;01:06:44;"The front is Futura Bold, says 8 Minute Cape Cod, and the back says This Show Rules and Joker Man."
01:06:44;01:06:45;"Right."
01:06:45;01:06:48;"Actually, we've been talking about we've got to do like a full Joker Man shirt."
01:06:48;01:06:55;"And even the fact now that we have confirmation that it's named after the Dylan song opens up a whole new world for us."
01:06:55;01:06:59;"I understand for you there maybe is not too much meaning, but for us, that opens up a whole new universe."
01:06:59;01:07:02;"Wow. So what's going on in this universe then?"
01:07:02;01:07:08;"Well, the fact that we've been so excited to cover this song is to delve into the universe of Joker Man."
01:07:08;01:07:16;"And the fact that there is a typeface with the same name, there's some kind of synergy there and there's some type of wisdom in that song."
01:07:16;01:07:21;"And for me, like I said, there's something about that song that represents the duality of man."
01:07:21;01:07:30;"I've always been interested in that intersection of lightheartedness and heaviness, which I think the song has, and the character Joker Man, and the font."
01:07:30;01:07:31;"Wow."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"That's always been the place that I've found the most fascinating."
01:07:33;01:07:34;"But anyway."
01:07:34;01:07:37;"Have you spoken to Mr. Dylan about this then?"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"We're going to have to get him on the next episode."
01:07:39;01:07:40;"Yeah."
01:07:40;01:07:41;"Do you have any information?"
01:07:41;01:07:47;"Now that it's been 23 years of the font, has anybody ever talked about the Dylan connection to you and said, ""Oh yeah, you know, actually like Bob."""
01:07:47;01:07:50;"Has anything ever gotten back to you, whether Bob knows about the font, anything like that?"
01:07:50;01:07:51;"No, no."
01:07:51;01:07:55;"I mean, I haven't heard from Bob's people if he likes it or if he's seen it."
01:07:55;01:07:57;"I mean, it'd be nice to know."
01:07:57;01:08:02;"Look, there's not a lot that we can offer here on Time Crisis, but one thing is we have a few connections in the music industry."
01:08:02;01:08:10;"So now that we have confirmation that there is a connection between the font and the song, I'm going to make it my mission to see if I can get any real confirmation."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"That'd be great."
01:08:11;01:08:15;"I mean, if he could send me a little note or something just to, you know, that'd be brilliant."
01:08:15;01:08:21;"I'd like to think my image of Bob is he's the type of guy who would appreciate it, you know?"
01:08:21;01:08:22;"Yeah."
01:08:22;01:08:26;"He's coming over to the UK next year with Neil Young to play in the summer."
01:08:26;01:08:27;"Oh, I saw that."
01:08:27;01:08:28;"Wow."
01:08:28;01:08:29;"So maybe I could meet him."
01:08:29;01:08:31;"You could pull some strings or something."
01:08:31;01:08:33;"Well, I know that he's pretty cagey about meeting people."
01:08:33;01:08:34;"I know."
01:08:34;01:08:38;"Because we actually played on the same stage as him in Japan this summer."
01:08:38;01:08:46;"We played right after Bob Dylan, not because the festival wanted us to headline over Bob, but because he was like, ""I want to leave early."""
01:08:46;01:08:47;"Right."
01:08:47;01:08:49;"""You can swap me with whoever is playing before us."""
01:08:49;01:08:53;"So we watched him a little bit on the side of the stage, but we were told very strictly."
01:08:53;01:08:54;"No eye contact."
01:08:54;01:08:58;"No phones, even though he's on stage in front of, you know, 100,000 people."
01:08:58;01:09:02;"And they also said, you know, if he walks past you, whatever, just, you know, don't say anything."
01:09:02;01:09:03;"Bow your head."
01:09:03;01:09:04;"Fair enough."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"It's Bob Dylan."
01:09:05;01:09:07;"He'd probably want to have a chat with you."
01:09:07;01:09:08;"Maybe his people don't let him."
01:09:08;01:09:09;"I don't know."
01:09:09;01:09:18;"I heard a story that when he was in the UK a while ago, he went to Liverpool and did the bus tour, the Beatle bus tour."
01:09:18;01:09:19;"Really? Just the tourist tour?"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"He was wearing a hat and a coat and stuff."
01:09:21;01:09:25;"And a lot of people didn't recognize him, you know."
01:09:25;01:09:27;"See, that's what you want to hear about Bob Dylan."
01:09:27;01:09:31;"Just like, just checking out the Beatles bus tour, just low key."
01:09:31;01:09:32;"Yeah."
01:09:32;01:09:34;"Well, anyway, Andrew, thanks so much for taking the time."
01:09:34;01:09:36;"We hope you'll call in again."
01:09:36;01:09:37;"Well, thanks."
01:09:37;01:09:38;"It's great."
01:09:38;01:09:41;"You love the font so much and, you know, it's bringing a lot of joy and happiness to you."
01:09:41;01:09:43;"100% and to a lot of other people as well."
01:09:43;01:09:44;"That's great."
01:09:44;01:09:45;"So thanks, Andrew."
01:09:45;01:09:46;"We appreciate it."
01:09:46;01:09:47;"Have a good one."
01:09:47;01:09:48;"OK."
01:09:48;01:09:49;"Cheers, then."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"Bye."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"Once upon a time, you dressed so fine."
01:09:51;01:09:54;"Threw the bumps of dime in your prime."
01:09:54;01:09:58;"Then you."
01:09:58;01:10:00;"People call, say beware, doll."
01:10:00;01:10:01;"You're bound to fall."
01:10:01;01:10:04;"You thought they were all."
01:10:04;01:10:09;"Kidding you."
01:10:09;01:10:14;"You used to laugh about."
01:10:14;01:10:18;"Everybody that was hanging out."
01:10:18;01:10:23;"Now you don't talk so loud."
01:10:23;01:10:28;"Now you don't seem so proud."
01:10:28;01:10:34;"About having to be scrounging."
01:10:34;01:10:38;"Your next meal."
01:10:38;01:10:43;"How does it feel?"
01:10:48;01:10:53;"To be without a home."
01:10:53;01:10:58;"No."
01:10:58;01:11:00;"OK, Jake, you're in for the top five."
01:11:00;01:11:01;"Yep."
01:11:01;01:11:05;"It's time for the top five."
01:11:05;01:11:08;"Five on iTunes."
01:11:08;01:11:09;"This week on the top five."
01:11:09;01:11:11;"Staying in the 90s, aren't we?"
01:11:11;01:11:12;"We're staying in the 90s."
01:11:12;01:11:15;"Yeah, we were getting bogged down in that late 70s, early 80s vibe, man."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"Yeah, I was sick of it."
01:11:17;01:11:18;"Everyone was."
01:11:18;01:11:19;"Seventy nine."
01:11:19;01:11:20;"Eighty one."
01:11:20;01:11:21;"Always."
01:11:21;01:11:22;"Seventy seven."
01:11:22;01:11:23;"I was terrible."
01:11:23;01:11:24;"Anyway, we want more of the 90s."
01:11:24;01:11:26;"The 90s are on trend."
01:11:26;01:11:27;"They're in fashion."
01:11:27;01:11:29;"Everything old is new again."
01:11:29;01:11:30;"Right."
01:11:30;01:11:31;"20 year cycle, whatever."
01:11:31;01:11:37;"And we picked 1995 as the year that we were going to compare to."
01:11:37;01:11:39;"Why do we pick 1995?"
01:11:39;01:11:41;"It's the year I graduated high school."
01:11:41;01:11:44;"And the year that Andrew Smith created the Joker Man font."
01:11:44;01:11:45;"That's right."
01:11:45;01:11:47;"Pomparog High School, class of '95."
01:11:47;01:11:49;"What was your high school called?"
01:11:49;01:11:50;"Pomparog."
01:11:50;01:11:52;"It's like a Native American word?"
01:11:52;01:11:53;"Yeah."
01:11:53;01:11:54;"Pomparog."
01:11:54;01:11:58;"P-O-M-P-E-R-A-U-G."
01:11:58;01:12:03;"Like the guest speaker at your graduation is like, ""To the class of 1995,"
01:12:03;01:12:06;"you're graduating into a brand new world."
01:12:06;01:12:11;"The internet is connecting people in ways that couldn't have even been imagined"
01:12:11;01:12:14;"when I graduated high school in 1959."
01:12:14;01:12:18;"Andrew Smith recently unveiled a new font called Joker Man,"
01:12:18;01:12:22;"changing the way that people think about the Bob Dylan song Joker Man."
01:12:22;01:12:23;"And coffee shops."
01:12:24;01:12:25;"Worldwide."
01:12:25;01:12:28;"So, yeah, '95 is the year that Joker Man dropped."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"You know, it's funny."
01:12:29;01:12:33;"I think the song Joker Man dropped in 1984, the year that I was born."
01:12:33;01:12:34;"Can I get a number crunch on that, Seinfeld?"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"Really? That late? I thought it was earlier."
01:12:36;01:12:39;"It was recorded in 1983, released in 1984."
01:12:39;01:12:40;"You nailed it."
01:12:40;01:12:41;"Boom."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"You nailed it."
01:12:42;01:12:43;"1984, Joker Man drops."
01:12:43;01:12:45;"I had to wait another 11 years for the font."
01:12:45;01:12:47;"Anyway, the number five song, 1995."
01:12:47;01:12:50;"1995, I remember this s--t well because I was 11 years old."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"I probably know it really well, too. Yeah."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"I remember this song was huge."
01:12:54;01:12:58;"This was a major song for my generation."
01:12:58;01:13:02;"This is the number five song in 1995, Coolio, Gangsta's Paradise featuring LV."
01:13:02;01:13:03;"Oh, wow."
01:13:05;01:13:10;"So this song interpolates the Stevie Wonder song, Pastime Paradise."
01:13:10;01:13:11;"Right."
01:13:11;01:13:13;"Off of the Songs and the Key of Life album."
01:13:13;01:13:14;"That's right."
01:13:17;01:13:21;"I take a look at my life and realize there's nothing left."
01:13:21;01:13:23;"Do you know every word of this song?"
01:13:23;01:13:26;"No, I have not heard this song in many, many years."
01:13:26;01:13:29;"Every time I hear this, I know almost every word."
01:13:29;01:13:31;"I think I had the CD single of this."
01:13:31;01:13:34;"I didn't have the--this is on the Dangerous Mind soundtrack."
01:13:34;01:13:35;"I didn't even have the whole soundtrack."
01:13:35;01:13:36;"Sure, sure."
01:13:36;01:13:38;"But this is just--I don't know why."
01:13:38;01:13:41;"This song is so easy to learn, and you just heard it so much."
01:13:41;01:13:43;"It's real slow."
01:13:55;01:13:57;"You think Coolio double tracks his vocal?"
01:13:57;01:13:59;"Does it sound double tracked?"
01:13:59;01:14:04;"I mean, a lot of rappers will do a second pass where they emphasize certain words."
01:14:04;01:14:06;"I feel like Tupac double tracked everything."
01:14:06;01:14:07;"Really?"
01:14:07;01:14:09;"This one's actually reminding me of Tupac."
01:14:09;01:14:11;"It's kind of a Tupac flow."
01:14:11;01:14:13;"I'd never heard that before."
01:14:17;01:14:19;"That's definitely--it does sound double tracked here."
01:14:23;01:14:25;"Too much television."
01:14:25;01:14:26;"Seinfeld knows it."
01:14:26;01:14:28;"I know this whole thing."
01:14:53;01:15:03;"So blind to see that the ones we hurt are you and me."
01:15:03;01:15:04;"It's a great song."
01:15:04;01:15:05;"Yep."
01:15:05;01:15:08;"It also makes you go back and realize how incredible Stevie Wonder is."
01:15:08;01:15:09;"I know."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"When you really go through all his--"
01:15:10;01:15:11;"What is the Stevie song?"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"Pastime Paradise."
01:15:13;01:15:19;"And also, Stevie Wonder, his run of albums in the '70s is so unbelievable."
01:15:19;01:15:21;"Secret Life of Plants, dude."
01:15:21;01:15:22;"That's a great album."
01:15:26;01:15:28;"Track 8 on Songs on the Keylight."
01:15:28;01:15:31;"Also, just like nothing sounds--like what was the reference for this song?"
01:16:02;01:16:03;"Classic double album."
01:16:03;01:16:04;"Yeah, this is wild."
01:16:04;01:16:05;"Songs on the Keylight."
01:16:31;01:16:32;"Incredible."
01:16:32;01:16:35;"The number five song of 2018, ""Thank U, Next."""
01:16:35;01:16:37;"We talked about this one last time."
01:16:37;01:16:39;"You remember this one, Jake?"
01:16:39;01:16:40;"No."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"This is the one where Ariana Grande--"
01:16:42;01:16:43;"Oh, right."
01:16:43;01:16:45;"--says she's thankful for her exes."
01:16:45;01:16:47;"And then she's thankful for herself?"
01:16:47;01:16:48;"That's right."
01:16:48;01:16:49;"That's the plot twist."
01:16:49;01:16:50;"Spoiler alert."
01:17:39;01:17:40;"Well, hold on."
01:17:40;01:17:42;"We've probably said everything we have to say about this song,"
01:17:42;01:17:45;"but you're telling me that we have a new song from Patrick World?"
01:17:45;01:17:50;"Yeah, he DM'd us late last night and just said,"
01:17:50;01:17:52;"""I've got to get one more in before the end of the year."""
01:17:52;01:17:55;"Well, he's completed his hat trick because we're playing it."
01:17:55;01:17:57;"Here's ""Thank U, Ez"" from Patrick World."
01:17:59;01:18:01;"Time crisis."
01:18:01;01:18:02;"This is the time crisis."
01:18:02;01:18:03;"Sweet Chili Heat."
01:18:03;01:18:05;"Sweet Chili Heat, world premiere."
01:18:05;01:18:06;"Brought to you by Doritos."
01:18:06;01:18:08;"Sweet Chili Heat."
01:18:24;01:18:25;"Ooh, nice falsetto."
01:18:33;01:18:34;"[laughter]"
01:19:11;01:19:14;"[laughter]"
01:19:14;01:19:17;"Wow, he really crammed in the references on that one."
01:19:17;01:19:20;"Patrick is a very close listener of the show."
01:19:20;01:19:23;"I wonder if the average TC head is catching all those references."
01:19:23;01:19:26;"Right, ""Welcome to My Life"" is kind of deep."
01:19:26;01:19:32;"I feel like the second fridge full of McRibs is definitely top five TC."
01:19:32;01:19:33;"Sure, that's classic."
01:19:33;01:19:34;"Lonnie's dad is classic."
01:19:34;01:19:35;"Although, I do want a Quibble."
01:19:35;01:19:36;"What's that?"
01:19:36;01:19:37;"It's a freezer, not a fridge."
01:19:37;01:19:39;"Oh!"
01:19:39;01:19:43;"He said fridge, not a Quibble."
01:19:43;01:19:45;"Patrick, your work's incredible."
01:19:45;01:19:49;"Although, you could make the case they were two slightly separate conversations"
01:19:49;01:19:53;"because Lonnie's dad had the freezer, but we did talk about it being a two-fridge household."
01:19:53;01:19:56;"He kind of took two time crisis things and put them together."
01:19:56;01:20:01;"I guess you could have the McRibs in the freezer portion of the second fridge."
01:20:01;01:20:02;"Yes."
01:20:02;01:20:04;"But I'm picturing more of a chest freezer."
01:20:04;01:20:06;"A chest freezer."
01:20:06;01:20:09;"Yeah, there's something very specific about a chest freezer, too."
01:20:09;01:20:10;"Yeah, that's like a real hunter vibe."
01:20:10;01:20:12;"Yeah, it's very hunter."
01:20:12;01:20:15;"Got 80 pounds of venison in the chest freezer."
01:20:15;01:20:22;"The number four song this week in 1995, Mariah Carey, who actually is just putting out a new album now."
01:20:22;01:20:23;"Really?"
01:20:23;01:20:24;"Yeah."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"Man, Mariah Carey in the 90s."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"Peak."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"She was killing it."
01:20:28;01:20:29;"This is a fantasy."
01:20:29;01:20:31;"Oh, wow. Classic."
01:20:31;01:20:32;"This is the one that--"
01:20:32;01:20:35;"This is another 70s sample."
01:20:35;01:20:37;"Yeah, 80s."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"Yeah, Tom Tom Club."
01:20:39;01:20:40;"Oh, is that 80s?"
01:20:40;01:20:41;"It's very early 80s."
01:20:52;01:21:00;"This might be a rare example where I actually like the updated version more than the original."
01:21:00;01:21:01;"Oh, you like this more than Tom Tom Club?"
01:21:01;01:21:02;"I do."
01:21:02;01:21:03;"Really?"
01:21:03;01:21:07;"I think the melodies are-- the melody that she writes over is really good."
01:21:26;01:21:28;"In '95, I was not into this."
01:21:28;01:21:30;"Too busy listening to God Above Voices?"
01:21:30;01:21:31;"Yeah, that kind of stuff."
01:21:31;01:21:35;"But I just-- hearing this later, years later, I was like, ""Oh, this is a great song."""
01:21:35;01:21:37;"It's so feel good, but it's not cheesy."
01:21:37;01:21:38;"Right, right."
01:21:56;01:21:57;"Mariah Carey rules."
01:21:57;01:21:58;"Yep."
01:21:58;01:22:03;"The number four song back in 2018 is ""An Old Friend."""
01:22:06;01:22:12;"Okay, so it is slowly slipping in the charts, but it is hanging tough."
01:22:12;01:22:14;"The first time we encountered this song, it was number one."
01:22:14;01:22:16;"And it was like that for a few episodes."
01:22:16;01:22:17;"Yeah."
01:22:20;01:22:24;"I'm going to read an email that we got from a guy named Charlie as we listen to this."
01:22:27;01:22:30;"""Hi, guys. Firstly, love the show. Keep rolling."
01:22:30;01:22:33;"I must admit I'm a TC head, not really into VW,"
01:22:33;01:22:37;"mainly because I didn't really have exposure to it before TC came along."""
01:22:37;01:22:40;"Interesting. How the hell did you get into TC?"
01:22:40;01:22:41;"But that's interesting."
01:22:41;01:22:44;"""Anyway, to the important question, de jure."
01:22:44;01:22:47;"What is the maximum number of syllables you can make out of a word in a song?"
01:22:47;01:22:52;"Just listening to Chart with Brooke and Halsey stretched a few words to fit the music,"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"and then it was followed by 'shallow.'"""
01:22:54;01:23:00;"In the sha-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-low. In the sha-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-low."
01:23:00;01:23:03;"Is that maximum number canon across universes?"
01:23:03;01:23:07;"So in the Acebo, is it the same as in the real universe?"
01:23:07;01:23:08;"He doesn't really like shallow."
01:23:08;01:23:11;"He goes on to say, ""For what it's worth, my feeling on the shallow songs,"
01:23:11;01:23:13;"that is just lazy songwriting."
01:23:13;01:23:17;"I could think of loads of lyrics that would fit the context of the song in the music phrasing."
01:23:17;01:23:21;"Anyway, interested in your thoughts on this musical parameter. Cheers, Charlie."""
01:23:21;01:23:24;"I mean, you know, Charlie, I don't do that that much in my songwriting,"
01:23:24;01:23:26;"but that's probably because I'm a coward."
01:23:26;01:23:30;"There's something really bold about just taking a word and just stretching it out."
01:23:30;01:23:31;"I respect it."
01:23:31;01:23:34;"I'm trying to think of other iconic examples."
01:23:34;01:23:38;"""In all the good times I find myself"""
01:23:38;01:23:40;"Kind of drawing a blank. It's hard to think with the music."
01:23:40;01:23:44;"Right. ""Falling for a change."
01:23:44;01:23:49;"And in the bad times I fear myself."""
01:23:49;01:23:52;"""I'm on the deep end."""
01:23:52;01:23:59;"""I'll never meet the ground."""
01:23:59;01:24:02;"The lyrics are kind of awkward in this song."
01:24:02;01:24:03;"Whoa."
01:24:03;01:24:06;"This is like when you're like, are you tired of this modern world?"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"This is like, that's a little stock."
01:24:08;01:24:09;"That's my favorite though."
01:24:09;01:24:12;"Or like, is it hard keeping it so hardcore?"
01:24:12;01:24:15;"I just find that awkward."
01:24:15;01:24:17;"The one thing I'll say, I love this song."
01:24:17;01:24:19;"Yeah. I'm in. I root for it."
01:24:19;01:24:22;"I listen to it every morning and every night."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"You're doing your pushups and your chin-ups."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"Jake, to your point though,"
01:24:26;01:24:30;"is Jackson Maine in the Aceboo supposed to be a great songwriter?"
01:24:30;01:24:32;"Yeah. Eh, who knows?"
01:24:32;01:24:35;"One day we got to get B-Koops on this show."
01:24:35;01:24:37;"And it'll be like, you know, when I created the character Jackson Maine,"
01:24:37;01:24:40;"I thought he'd be, you know, a decent guy."
01:24:40;01:24:45;"Probably the type of guy that, you know, a Guided by Voices fan would not respect."
01:24:45;01:24:47;"That was on my mood board."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"Part of my mood board, what does this fan look like?"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"What does the hater look like?"
01:24:51;01:24:54;"And I had a picture of Jake, American Painter radio personality."
01:24:54;01:24:58;"The one thing I'll question, just from a meaning point of view,"
01:24:58;01:25:00;"is that the chorus is there saying,"
01:25:00;01:25:03;"I'm going to dive in and I'm in the deep end or some s***, right?"
01:25:03;01:25:07;"I'm in the deep end, implying that like, things are getting tough, right?"
01:25:07;01:25:10;"We're like, we could drown, you know, or things are heavy."
01:25:10;01:25:12;"And then she goes, we're far from the shallow now."
01:25:12;01:25:18;"And then together they sing, in the shallow, shallow, in the sh-shallow,"
01:25:18;01:25:22;"in the shallow, shallow, we're far from the shallow now."
01:25:22;01:25:26;"So then when you actually take a step back and you're like, I was with you."
01:25:26;01:25:28;"You dived in the deep end, s*** all crazy."
01:25:28;01:25:30;"You're far from the shallow."
01:25:30;01:25:33;"But then why did you, what was this part where you guys just started saying,"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"in the shallow?"
01:25:35;01:25:39;"Shouldn't it be, we're far from the shallow now."
01:25:39;01:25:44;"In the deep end, we're in the deep end, in the dee-deep end."
01:25:44;01:25:46;"Doesn't roll off the tongue, man."
01:25:46;01:25:48;"In the deep end, deep end. Doesn't sing well."
01:25:48;01:25:50;"We're far from the shallow now."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"Wouldn't that make more sense?"
01:25:52;01:25:54;"Yeah, but this is classic you. Nobody's in the shallow."
01:25:54;01:25:58;"You apply this like rigorous logic to your lyrical analysis."
01:25:58;01:26:01;"When anybody listens to Vampire Weekend knows that I do the same."
01:26:01;01:26:03;"They are airtight."
01:26:03;01:26:07;"Who gives a f*** about an Oxford comma, you know damn well that that was vetted."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"That was rigorous."
01:26:09;01:26:14;"Airtight logic, through and through on every E. Koenig song."
01:26:14;01:26:19;"M79, over 150 drafts, two years of QC."
01:26:19;01:26:21;"That's quality control for people who don't work in the business."
01:26:21;01:26:23;"No, I love the song."
01:26:23;01:26:26;"It's like, that's one unusual quirk about this song."
01:26:26;01:26:28;"Is we're far from the shallow now."
01:26:28;01:26:29;"Not unusual."
01:26:29;01:26:30;"In the shallow."
01:26:30;01:26:32;"Nobody's in the shallow. You guys are in the deep end."
01:26:32;01:26:34;"Not the shallow. Might have been a good..."
01:26:34;01:26:36;"Yeah, not the shallow."
01:26:36;01:26:42;"It also is a good reminder too that sometimes you can get a little bogged down in terms of like logic with songwriting."
01:26:42;01:26:46;"And then you actually, like if they had changed it, it would actually be worse."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"So who cares?"
01:26:47;01:26:48;"Yeah."
01:26:48;01:26:49;"But then also that's why songs can be fun to talk about."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"Because sometimes there are contradictions in them."
01:26:51;01:26:53;"I don't need a song to be perfect."
01:26:53;01:26:54;"I need it to just be a song."
01:26:54;01:26:57;"And then I need to have an internet radio show to talk about it."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"You know what I mean?"
01:26:58;01:26:59;"That's part of the fun."
01:26:59;01:27:01;"Is to say that part of the song doesn't make sense."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"Doesn't mean you don't like the song."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"I don't even think it doesn't make sense."
01:27:04;01:27:06;"It doesn't serve the narrative."
01:27:06;01:27:07;"Yeah."
01:27:07;01:27:09;"But they're in the shallow."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"Like they're going back and forth."
01:27:10;01:27:12;"They're in the shallow, they're in the deep end."
01:27:12;01:27:13;"Then they're back in the shallow."
01:27:13;01:27:17;"And then they're at the very end of the last phrase is, ""Then they're out of the shallow."""
01:27:17;01:27:20;"Nothing about the song implies that they went back to the shallow."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"Well except for saying it."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"It's not canon that they went back."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"No, but they don't say, ""Then we went back to the shallow."""
01:27:25;01:27:26;"They say, ""In the shallow."""
01:27:26;01:27:28;"I'm just saying the rest of the song you could almost tell as a story."
01:27:28;01:27:30;"In fact, the story might be a star is born."
01:27:30;01:27:32;"A guy meets a girl."
01:27:32;01:27:34;"And he can tell that there's an emptiness in her life."
01:27:34;01:27:37;"There's something she doesn't like about the modern world."
01:27:37;01:27:40;"He can tell it's almost like her life is too plain."
01:27:40;01:27:44;"But on the flip side, she looks at him and she says, ""Okay, I get it."
01:27:44;01:27:48;"You don't like the modern world and you're telling me like I should be fed up with the modern world."
01:27:48;01:27:50;"But here you are living this hardcore life."
01:27:50;01:27:51;"Doesn't that get tiring too?"""
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Sounds pretty hard."
01:27:52;01:27:53;"Yeah."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"Isn't it hard to keep it so hardcore?"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"Okay, maybe we're actually two sides of the same coin."
01:27:57;01:27:59;"Where two people have different forms of dissatisfaction."
01:27:59;01:28:02;"I mean you're mining the dregs of this dying art form."
01:28:02;01:28:03;"Yeah."
01:28:03;01:28:07;"You're trying to be a rocker and I'm trying to be a pop--whatever."
01:28:07;01:28:11;"But at the same time, the grass is always greener or whatever."
01:28:11;01:28:17;"But one thing that we have in common is that we're falling in love and that our life is getting crazy."
01:28:17;01:28:18;"So we're diving in."
01:28:18;01:28:19;"You got your issues."
01:28:19;01:28:20;"I got my issues."
01:28:20;01:28:23;"That's also a classic, especially modern song thing."
01:28:23;01:28:24;"There's a song called ""Issues."""
01:28:24;01:28:25;"I got issues."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"You got them too."
01:28:26;01:28:30;"That's basically what the song is. It's a different version of ""Issues"" by Julia Michaels."
01:28:30;01:28:32;"You got your issues, man."
01:28:32;01:28:33;"I got my issues."
01:28:33;01:28:34;"But you know what?"
01:28:34;01:28:38;"We gotta explore the serious chemistry between us and we're gonna dive in."
01:28:38;01:28:39;"So we're not in the shallow."
01:28:39;01:28:40;"We're diving in."
01:28:40;01:28:41;"We're in the deep end."
01:28:41;01:28:43;"In fact, we're far from the shallow."
01:28:43;01:28:45;"I know exactly what's happening."
01:28:45;01:28:46;"And then there's just this weird part."
01:28:46;01:28:47;"""In the shallow."""
01:28:47;01:28:48;"What?"
01:28:48;01:28:49;"You know."
01:28:49;01:28:50;"It's confusing."
01:28:50;01:28:51;"Okay."
01:28:51;01:28:52;"I still love the song though."
01:28:52;01:28:58;"The number three song in 1995 was LL Cool J featuring Boyz II Men, ""Hey Lover."""
01:28:58;01:29:03;"LL Cool J, a long history of slow jams."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"Not sure I know this one."
01:29:05;01:29:08;"Features a sample from Michael Jackson's ""The Lady in My Life."""
01:29:08;01:29:10;"I never asked for anything."
01:29:10;01:29:13;"This is love."
01:29:13;01:29:16;"This is more than a crush."
01:29:16;01:29:18;"Love."
01:29:18;01:29:19;"Yeah."
01:29:19;01:29:34;"LL Cool J always stealing people's girlfriends."

01:29:41;01:29:43;"You're only new in five months."

01:29:54;01:29:56;"I used to have this LL Cool J tape."
01:29:56;01:29:58;"I very briefly had a car."
01:29:58;01:30:03;"The only time in my life that I had my car was I had my parents' old car for six months"

01:30:12;01:30:16;"Which even at the time was already an archaic form of technology."

01:30:21;01:30:23;"It was a very minor single from him."

01:32:36;01:32:38;"""I'm doing your girlfriend."
01:32:38;01:32:40;"That's something you can't believe."""
01:32:40;01:32:43;"That song has fascinated me for over a decade."
01:32:43;01:32:44;"Unsurprisingly--"
01:32:44;01:32:46;"Yeah, that's a crazy song."
01:32:46;01:32:48;"I also love the fact that we haven't even played it."
01:32:48;01:32:52;"But unsurprisingly, that, as opposed to ""Hey, Love,"" or featuring Boyz II Men,"
01:32:52;01:32:55;"""I'm that type of guy"" was not particularly a hit for LL Cool J."
01:32:55;01:32:57;"That was actually kind of a commercial low point for him."
01:32:57;01:32:59;"This is not the song that's in the top five?"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"No, I'm saying that it made me think of an LL Cool--"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"I don't know this song that well."
01:33:03;01:33:06;"No, this is a song from the late '80s because he came out and he was really big."
01:33:06;01:33:09;"And then he had kind of like this awkward run of albums that didn't do that well."
01:33:09;01:33:11;"And then he came back with ""Mama Said Knock You Out."""
01:33:11;01:33:13;"Is that this era?"
01:33:13;01:33:14;"This was kind of the--"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"Right after ""Mama Said""?"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"""Mama Said Knock You Out"" was like '91 or something."
01:33:18;01:33:19;"This is '95."
01:33:19;01:33:22;"So he came out in the mid-'80s, the Rick Rubin production."
01:33:22;01:33:25;"Changing culture, awkwardness in the late '80s,"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"then burst back into the '90s, ""Mama Said Knock You Out,"""
01:33:27;01:33:30;"then had a really cool run through this album."
01:33:30;01:33:33;"Anyway, we should try to get LL on to ask him about that song."
01:33:33;01:33:35;"He'd be like, ""Pfft, there's no theory, guys."""
01:33:35;01:33:38;"Yeah, it would kind of be like that, like me reading deep into ""Joker,"" man."
01:33:38;01:33:41;"Be like, ""Oh, what's the story?"""
01:33:41;01:33:42;"Yeah."
01:33:42;01:33:44;"This is a song about late capitalism."
01:33:44;01:33:46;"I wrote those lyrics during lunch, man."
01:33:46;01:33:48;"But why would you address the guy?"
01:33:48;01:33:49;"It's just a song, man."
01:33:49;01:33:52;"I was doing his girlfriend. What do you want from me?"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"The record company asked me for a new single."
01:33:54;01:33:55;"Doing is such a--"
01:33:55;01:33:57;"I was doing this guy's girlfriend."
01:33:57;01:33:59;"Raw term."
01:33:59;01:34:01;"Write what you know."
01:34:01;01:34:05;"I haven't heard that since middle school was also that euphemism for sex."
01:34:05;01:34:06;"Do?"
01:34:06;01:34:10;"Yeah, and actually, LL, later in the '90s, he famously had the song,"
01:34:10;01:34:12;"""Doin' It, Doin' It, Doin' It."""
01:34:12;01:34:13;"Oh, yeah."
01:34:13;01:34:14;"That was a good song."
01:34:14;01:34:15;"He's into the word ""do."""
01:34:15;01:34:17;"And actually, ""Doin' It"" goes down a lot easier than"
01:34:17;01:34:20;"""I'm doin' your girlfriend."""
01:34:20;01:34:21;"And also, the phrasing is so weird."
01:34:21;01:34:22;"""I'm doin' your girlfriend."""
01:34:22;01:34:24;"That's something you can't believe."
01:34:24;01:34:26;"[laughs]"
01:34:26;01:34:28;"LL, I can't believe it."
01:34:28;01:34:31;"Anyway, the number three song in 2018 is"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"Panic! At The Disco - ""High Hopes."""
01:34:33;01:34:34;"These guys are crushing it right now."
01:34:39;01:34:42;"Panic! At The Disco."
01:34:42;01:34:45;"I'm doin' your girlfriend."
01:34:45;01:34:48;"Had to have high, high hopes for a living."
01:34:48;01:34:51;"Shootin' for the stars when I couldn't make a killin'."
01:34:51;01:34:54;"Didn't ever die, but I always had a vision."
01:34:54;01:34:57;"Always had high, high hopes."
01:34:57;01:35:00;"Had to have high, high hopes for a living."
01:35:00;01:35:03;"Didn't know how, but I always had a feelin'."
01:35:03;01:35:06;"I was gonna be that one in a million."
01:35:06;01:35:09;"Always had high, high hopes."
01:35:09;01:35:10;"Mama said--"
01:35:10;01:35:12;"I like this song more and more every time I hear it."
01:35:12;01:35:13;"Yeah."
01:35:13;01:35:14;"I'm getting pretty amped now."
01:35:14;01:35:15;"I'm down."
01:35:15;01:35:17;"Manifest destiny back in the days."
01:35:17;01:35:20;"We wanted everything, wanted everything."
01:35:20;01:35:25;"Mama said, burn your biographies, rewrite your history."
01:35:25;01:35:28;"Light up your wildest dreams, museum victories."
01:35:28;01:35:32;"Every day we wanted everything, wanted everything."
01:35:32;01:35:35;"Mama said, don't give up."
01:35:35;01:35:38;"It's a little complicated."
01:35:38;01:35:41;"All tied up, no more love."
01:35:41;01:35:43;"And I'd hate to see you waiting."
01:35:43;01:35:46;"Had to have high, high hopes for a living."
01:35:46;01:35:49;"Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killin'."
01:35:49;01:35:51;"Didn't ever die, but I always had a vision."
01:35:51;01:35:55;"It's no surprise that that song was featured in an EA Sports"
01:35:55;01:35:58;"video game, NHL 19, as well as during the NHL's"
01:35:58;01:36:01;"promotional campaign for the 2018 Stanley Cup Final."
01:36:01;01:36:02;"That is deep."
01:36:02;01:36:05;"If I was an athlete, I'd make that my walk-on."
01:36:05;01:36:07;"Maybe Vampire Weekend should walk after that song."
01:36:07;01:36:08;"Yeah."
01:36:08;01:36:11;"I've always liked these kind of pump-up songs"
01:36:11;01:36:12;"with chopped-up horns."
01:36:12;01:36:15;"Like, we used to walk out to this Drake song."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"[MUSIC - DRAKE, ""REGAL""]"
01:36:17;01:36:21;"This is cool."
01:36:21;01:36:24;"You know, like, the big brass, it has kind of like a--"
01:36:24;01:36:25;"Regal."
01:36:25;01:36:28;"--a regal/athletic connotation."
01:36:28;01:36:32;"(RAPPING) Hand-hand records on my demo."
01:36:32;01:36:34;"Did y'all boys not get the memo?"
01:36:34;01:36:37;"I do not stay at the Intercontinental."
01:36:37;01:36:39;"That's a classic line, too."
01:36:39;01:36:41;"I do not stay at the Intercontinental."
01:36:41;01:36:43;"And Intercontinentals are not garbage."
01:36:43;01:36:47;"In Toronto, the Intercontinental is like a three-star."
01:36:47;01:36:48;"Oh, really?"
01:36:48;01:36:50;"Yeah, just weirdly just not one city."
01:36:50;01:36:51;"That's true."
01:36:51;01:36:53;"Different cities sometimes, like, yeah,"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"like the four seasons in one city is like this incredible hotel"
01:36:55;01:36:56;"in another."
01:36:56;01:36:58;"It's not-- that's the power of branding."
01:36:58;01:37:00;"Do you ever worry that the walk-on song is"
01:37:00;01:37:01;"going to, like, upstage you?"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"Like, you think about what you're opening with."
01:37:03;01:37:05;"Oh, yeah, big time."
01:37:05;01:37:08;"In fact, that's why maybe the Panic at the Disco song"
01:37:08;01:37:09;"is a bad idea."
01:37:09;01:37:11;"Because, you know, Vampire Weekend were considered a rock"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"or an indie rock band."
01:37:13;01:37:15;"We come out to a Drake song."
01:37:15;01:37:18;"Well, people already know they're not seeing a high-energy rap"
01:37:18;01:37:20;"show from one of the biggest Canadian rappers of all time."
01:37:20;01:37:22;"So it's kind of like, OK, Drake, all right,"
01:37:22;01:37:24;"now I'm ready to-- back to what I expected."
01:37:24;01:37:26;"But if we come out to a Panic at the Disco song,"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"that's one of the biggest bands in America."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"And now people are starting to think,"
01:37:30;01:37:31;"why am I not seeing Panic at the Disco?"
01:37:31;01:37:33;"Why am I seeing Vampire Weekend?"
01:37:33;01:37:34;"They're both bands."
01:37:34;01:37:37;"Panic at the Disco, their songs are arguably more exciting."
01:37:37;01:37:39;"Maybe I'm just, like, setting myself up."
01:37:39;01:37:41;"I guess you have to open with something that's, like,"
01:37:41;01:37:42;"similar tempo?"
01:37:42;01:37:44;"Because that Panic at the Disco song is fast."
01:37:44;01:37:45;"It's fast."
01:37:45;01:37:46;"Yeah, maybe that's true."
01:37:46;01:37:47;"That's the thing."
01:37:47;01:37:48;"So maybe if you open with, like, a slow song,"
01:37:48;01:37:49;"it'd be kind of weird, right?"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"I think when we played Australia last summer,"
01:37:51;01:37:52;"we walked out to Back in Black."
01:37:52;01:37:53;"OK."
01:37:53;01:37:54;"As kind of a nod to the country."
01:37:54;01:37:55;"That's slow."
01:37:55;01:37:58;"And everybody in the crowd just went like, da, da, da, da."
01:37:58;01:37:59;"Yeah."
01:37:59;01:38:00;"That went pretty well."
01:38:00;01:38:03;"The number two song in 1995, Whitney Houston,"
01:38:03;01:38:05;"from the Waiting to Exhale soundtrack,"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"Exhale, ""Shoop Shoop."""
01:38:07;01:38:12;"Everyone falls in love sometimes."
01:38:12;01:38:14;"I don't think I know this one either."
01:38:14;01:38:21;"Sometimes it's wrong and sometimes it's right."
01:38:21;01:38:28;"For every win, someone must fail."
01:38:28;01:38:29;"But there comes a brand new day."
01:38:29;01:38:32;"This song's written and produced by Babyface."
01:38:32;01:38:33;"He's killing it in the '90s."
01:38:33;01:38:35;"Yeah."
01:38:35;01:38:39;"Say shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop."
01:38:39;01:38:42;"Shoobadoo, doop, doop, doop, doop."
01:38:42;01:38:44;"Shoobadoo, doop, doop, doop."
01:38:44;01:38:45;"Remember this part?"
01:38:45;01:38:49;"No, it just reminds me of the salt and pepper."
01:38:49;01:38:50;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:38:50;01:38:53;"Shoop, shoop, shoop, doop, doop, doop."
01:38:53;01:38:57;"Shoop, shoop, shoop, doop, doop."
01:38:57;01:38:59;"My love for you now."
01:38:59;01:39:03;"Shoop, shoop, baby."
01:39:03;01:39:04;"Sometimes it's right."
01:39:04;01:39:06;"I'm not sure if I've ever heard this."
01:39:06;01:39:07;"It's an interesting chorus."
01:39:07;01:39:10;"This is what Babyface had to say about the song."
01:39:10;01:39:14;"When Whitney first heard the song, she'd figured, ""I just lost it."
01:39:14;01:39:16;"I couldn't come up with words anymore."""
01:39:16;01:39:17;"And actually, she's right."
01:39:17;01:39:20;"I couldn't think of anything for that particular part."
01:39:20;01:39:23;"It felt like it should groove there, but I knew it couldn't groove without any vocals,"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"so I started humming along with it, and that's what happened."
01:39:25;01:39:26;"The shoops came."
01:39:26;01:39:28;"But they felt so good, I thought, ""Why not?"
01:39:28;01:39:29;"It doesn't have to mean anything."""
01:39:29;01:39:30;"Oh, that's a good--"
01:39:30;01:39:32;"That kind of ties in with what we were saying before."
01:39:32;01:39:33;"Good theme for the show."
01:39:33;01:39:36;"Maybe they should have just said ""shoop"" instead of ""in the shallows."""
01:39:36;01:39:39;"Shoop, shoop, shoop, doop, doop, doop."
01:39:39;01:39:43;"I think it's okay when part of a song doesn't totally make sense."
01:39:43;01:39:47;"It's interesting to talk about, but it's okay because that's just like life, man."
01:39:47;01:39:48;"It's dream logic, man."
01:39:48;01:39:49;"It's dream logic."
01:39:49;01:39:53;"And also just like life, you know, you got a plan for the day."
01:39:53;01:39:57;"We're going to grab some burgers on our way to the beach or whatever, and, you know--"
01:39:57;01:39:58;"Cool plan."
01:39:58;01:39:59;"[laughter]"
01:39:59;01:40:00;"Jake's in."
01:40:00;01:40:02;"Very on board with this plan."
01:40:02;01:40:04;"And it doesn't always work out that way."
01:40:04;01:40:07;"The number two song back in 2018, Halsey,"
01:40:07;01:40:14;"one of the only people who exists in the stew and the acibo."
01:40:14;01:40:16;"This is her song ""Without Me."""
01:40:18;01:40:19;"Cool tone."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"I was about to say that is a cool tone."
01:40:27;01:40:29;"The track is a breakup song."
01:41:32;01:41:34;"This song has interesting production."
01:41:34;01:41:35;"It's very tasteful."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"I like it, and I always root for Halsey."
01:41:42;01:41:43;"Great."
01:41:43;01:41:44;"You know why?"
01:41:44;01:41:45;"Jersey."
01:41:45;01:41:47;"She's a Jersey girl."
01:41:47;01:41:48;"[laughter]"
01:41:48;01:41:50;"Not from Connecticut."
01:41:50;01:41:55;"Yeah, there's no way she'd have a career if she was from CT."
01:41:55;01:41:57;"Oh, here come the angry letters."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"Let's face it, man."
01:41:58;01:41:59;"Here come the angry letters."
01:41:59;01:42:01;"I mean, look."
01:42:01;01:42:03;"She's coming out of Hamden?"
01:42:03;01:42:04;"That's not going to work."
01:42:04;01:42:07;"The tri-state area is composed of three states."
01:42:07;01:42:10;"New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut."
01:42:10;01:42:12;"New Jersey has Halsey."
01:42:12;01:42:15;"Isn't Bebe Rexha from New York?"
01:42:15;01:42:16;"Seinfeld?"
01:42:16;01:42:17;"I think she is."
01:42:17;01:42:18;"Let's get a number crunch on that."
01:42:18;01:42:20;"Bebe Rexha, Brooklyn, New York City."
01:42:20;01:42:21;"Brooklyn!"
01:42:21;01:42:22;"USA."
01:42:22;01:42:23;"You got Cardi."
01:42:23;01:42:25;"Cardi B from the Bronx."
01:42:25;01:42:28;"Who of this modern class of pop stars is from Connecticut?"
01:42:28;01:42:29;"John Mayer."
01:42:29;01:42:32;"I respect him, but he's not a modern pop star."
01:42:32;01:42:33;"Michael Bolton."
01:42:33;01:42:36;"No, I mean, we're drawing a blank here."
01:42:36;01:42:38;"Somebody under 30."
01:42:38;01:42:41;"This is a running theme on the show."
01:42:41;01:42:42;"It's a real problem."
01:42:42;01:42:46;"I mean, we got to talk to some of the bigwigs out there in Connecticut."
01:42:46;01:42:49;"Maybe we got to get on the horn to Senator Richard Blumenthal."
01:42:49;01:42:51;"Or Senator Chris Murphy."
01:42:51;01:42:53;"I love that there's two of us."
01:42:53;01:42:55;"We just pulled the two Connecticut senators."
01:42:55;01:42:56;"That's pretty rare."
01:42:56;01:42:59;"I don't know if we could do that with too many states, but Seinfeld."
01:42:59;01:43:05;"Canada was always known for paying out some pretty big bucks to promote Canadian culture."
01:43:05;01:43:09;"Like, Canada bankrolled a lot of these Canadian bands' early tours."
01:43:09;01:43:11;"Yeah, there's the whole CanCon thing."
01:43:11;01:43:12;"What's CanCon?"
01:43:12;01:43:16;"So CanCon is Canadian content."
01:43:16;01:43:25;"Yes, and it's a requirement from the law of Canada that a certain percentage of all art, music,"
01:43:25;01:43:32;"film, television consumed has to be written, shot, produced in Canada."
01:43:32;01:43:33;"I think it's 20% or something."
01:43:33;01:43:36;"Modest, but respectable."
01:43:36;01:43:41;"But also, the Canadian government gives money to promote Canadian art abroad, right?"
01:43:41;01:43:42;"That sounds correct."
01:43:42;01:43:46;"The Canadian content system is called the MAPL. Maple."
01:43:46;01:43:48;"That's cute."
01:43:48;01:43:53;"To qualify as Canadian content, a musical selection must generally fulfill at least two of the following conditions."
01:43:53;01:43:57;"M, music. The music is composed entirely by a Canadian."
01:43:57;01:44:02;"A, artist. The music is, or the lyrics are, performed principally by a Canadian."
01:44:02;01:44:08;"So maybe if a Canadian pop star is singing three quarters and then, you know, G-Eazy drops a verse,"
01:44:08;01:44:11;"well, okay, he's not Canadian, but principally it was performed by a Canadian."
01:44:11;01:44:16;"P, performance. The musical selection consists of a performance that is recorded wholly in Canada"
01:44:16;01:44:20;"or performed wholly in Canada and broadcast live in Canada."
01:44:20;01:44:23;"L, lyrics. The lyrics are written entirely by a Canadian."
01:44:23;01:44:26;"Clearly, Connecticut needs a CanCon standard."
01:44:26;01:44:32;"Connecticut content, they need to give grants to Connecticut artists to help them punch above their weight."
01:44:32;01:44:34;"Where's the Connecticut Halsey?"
01:44:34;01:44:38;"For too long, Connecticut has languished in the shadows,"
01:44:38;01:44:45;"cast by our big brothers, or one big brother and one middle brother, New York and New Jersey."
01:44:45;01:44:48;"Would you say that Connecticut is the Canada of America?"
01:44:48;01:44:50;"Would that be a fair assessment?"
01:44:50;01:44:53;"I don't think any-- no, but I'll roll with it."
01:44:53;01:44:58;"I'll roll with it for no good reason. Yeah, sure, Connecticut is the Canada of America."
01:44:58;01:45:03;"CTTC heads are just banging their head against the wall right now."
01:45:03;01:45:06;"I know, we're going to get another email just like, you know, Jake--"
01:45:06;01:45:08;"There are so many great bands."
01:45:08;01:45:12;"As a self-hating-- okay, but we have talked-- look, I love Connecticut the state."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"Jake's hard on it because he's from there."
01:45:14;01:45:17;"We're not talking about quality. I'm actually being sympathetic to Connecticut."
01:45:17;01:45:18;"Just visibility."
01:45:18;01:45:19;"We're talking about visibility."
01:45:19;01:45:23;"When I say it's the Canada of America, I don't mean that as an insult either."
01:45:23;01:45:25;"Yeah. Oh, yeah, you're from Canada."
01:45:25;01:45:27;"You respect it. No, I love Canada."
01:45:27;01:45:29;"Canada's a f*cking cool country."
01:45:29;01:45:33;"The difference between-- Canada has a very nice veneer,"
01:45:33;01:45:37;"but then when you look under the hood of this, like, nice laid-back country,"
01:45:37;01:45:39;"you see some f*cking heavy hitters."
01:45:39;01:45:45;"You got Celine Dion, Drake, Alanis Morissette, Shania Twain, Avril Lavigne, Nickelback."
01:45:45;01:45:47;"Neil Young."
01:45:47;01:45:48;"Neil motherf*cking Young."
01:45:48;01:45:49;"Neil Peart."
01:45:49;01:45:51;"Yeah, CT is definitely not the--"
01:45:51;01:45:52;"Kids in the hall."
01:45:52;01:45:53;"--Canada of the U.S."
01:45:53;01:45:54;"Mike Myers."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"Jim Carrey."
01:45:56;01:45:57;"John Candy, rest in peace."
01:45:57;01:45:59;"Oh, man, I love John-- wait, John Candy was Canadian?"
01:45:59;01:46:00;"He was."
01:46:00;01:46:03;"Right, right, he's amazing. Love John Candy."
01:46:03;01:46:06;"Anyway, let's get Connecticut poppin'."
01:46:06;01:46:09;"Let's get Connecticut poppin'."
01:46:09;01:46:14;"We should fly Halsey to Connecticut to, like, do a workshop."
01:46:14;01:46:17;"We should fly her there."
01:46:17;01:46:19;"The premise is already--"
01:46:19;01:46:23;"That's a classic flight, that Newark to Hartford flight."
01:46:23;01:46:26;"No, Halsey's a big star. We're going to get her a chopper."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"Regional flight."
01:46:28;01:46:29;"We're going to get her a really nice helicopter."
01:46:29;01:46:31;"She's going to beat the traffic."
01:46:31;01:46:35;"Going to drop her at a local high school or, you know, some municipal building in Hartford."
01:46:35;01:46:39;"And we're going to get her, Bebe Rexha, Cardi B."
01:46:39;01:46:42;"I feel like this is a great reality show."
01:46:42;01:46:43;"Connecticut Idol."
01:46:43;01:46:46;"[laughter]"
01:46:46;01:46:49;"The judges are Cardi B, Halsey--"
01:46:49;01:46:50;"Me."
01:46:50;01:46:52;"--and Jake. Yeah, Jake's the--"
01:46:52;01:46:53;"Well, maybe John Mayer, too."
01:46:53;01:46:55;"Oh, and John Mayer. That's pretty tight."
01:46:55;01:46:56;"And Michael Bolton."
01:46:56;01:46:57;"[laughter]"
01:46:57;01:46:58;"We need five."
01:46:58;01:47:00;"I think Jake could be, like, the Ryan Seacrest."
01:47:00;01:47:01;"Right, right."
01:47:01;01:47:03;"Because of your hosting background."
01:47:03;01:47:04;"Right."
01:47:04;01:47:06;"Jake's side stage with, like, a microphone."
01:47:48;01:47:56;"First of all, Connecticut is so starved for a pop star that even if we can't break the pop star nationally,"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"we'll just be cleaning up in Connecticut."
01:47:58;01:47:59;"Yeah."
01:47:59;01:48:01;"And also maybe a little bit of Rhode Island, too."
01:48:01;01:48:07;"Yeah, I'd like if it was just, like, not only pop stars, too, just, like, general, like, CT talent."
01:48:07;01:48:15;"Just, like, this heavy metal band, God Murder, will be performing their song."
01:48:15;01:48:16;"Connecticut hardcore."
01:48:16;01:48:17;"Yeah, man."
01:48:17;01:48:20;"Wait, Seinfeld, what's the population in Connecticut?"
01:48:20;01:48:21;"Can I get a number crunch?"
01:48:21;01:48:22;"Hold on, let me guess."
01:48:22;01:48:23;"Oh, yeah, let's let Jake guess."
01:48:23;01:48:24;"Five million."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"Ezra, you want to take a guess?"
01:48:26;01:48:29;"I think that's a good guess."
01:48:29;01:48:30;"All undercut, Jake."
01:48:30;01:48:31;"I'll say 4.2."
01:48:31;01:48:32;"3.5."
01:48:32;01:48:33;"Oh, wow."
01:48:33;01:48:34;"That's small."
01:48:34;01:48:35;"3,588,000."
01:48:35;01:48:41;"Well, this makes a little more sense, though, because I bet Jersey is, like, double the size of CT."
01:48:41;01:48:44;"And obviously New York is, like, probably 15 million."
01:48:44;01:48:45;"Oh, yeah, that's a good point."
01:48:45;01:48:47;"Yeah, New York City alone is eight, right?"
01:48:47;01:48:51;"Well, then, yeah, I bet New York State is, like, 16."
01:48:51;01:48:53;"I was going to say, like, 10 or 12 outside of New York."
01:48:53;01:48:54;"No, no, no."
01:48:54;01:48:58;"I think it's, like, the population of the city equals the whole rest of the state, something like that."
01:48:58;01:48:59;"How big is New Jersey?"
01:48:59;01:49:02;"Okay, New York's population is eight million."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"New York City."
01:49:04;01:49:05;"New York State."
01:49:05;01:49:06;"Oh, you want the state?"
01:49:06;01:49:07;"Yeah."
01:49:07;01:49:08;"I'm going to say, like, a little--"
01:49:08;01:49:09;"I'm going to say 16."
01:49:09;01:49:10;"I'm going to say, like, 12."
01:49:10;01:49:12;"Guys, this show rules."
01:49:12;01:49:15;"This is so--"
01:49:15;01:49:16;"Just guessing."
01:49:16;01:49:19;"New York State population, 19.8 million."
01:49:19;01:49:20;"Oh, yeah."
01:49:20;01:49:21;"Okay, you nailed it, dude."
01:49:21;01:49:22;"It's a big boy."
01:49:22;01:49:23;"I'm surprised by that."
01:49:23;01:49:24;"Wow."
01:49:24;01:49:27;"Man, you're forgetting about-- we got Buffalo, Troy, Syracuse."
01:49:27;01:49:28;"Those are all under a million."
01:49:28;01:49:29;"I mean--"
01:49:29;01:49:30;"Schenectady."
01:49:30;01:49:31;"Plattsburgh."
01:49:32;01:49:33;"Nyack."
01:49:33;01:49:34;"You got all of Long Island."
01:49:34;01:49:35;"What's Buffalo, like 200,000?"
01:49:35;01:49:38;"Okay, now this is getting too cheap."
01:49:38;01:49:42;"This is completely just terrible radio."
01:49:42;01:49:48;"Okay, but the important thing, Connecticut 3.5, New York State--"
01:49:48;01:49:50;"Can I just get unstirred?"
01:49:50;01:49:53;"Howard, what's the population of Buffalo?"
01:49:53;01:49:56;"Okay, but what's the population of New Jersey?"
01:49:56;01:49:59;"Saratoga Springs."
01:49:59;01:50:02;"New Jersey's population is 9,032,000."
01:50:02;01:50:06;"Okay, so Connecticut, you're right, is at a serious disadvantage in terms of number of people."
01:50:06;01:50:07;"Yep."
01:50:07;01:50:12;"So I think it's cool to help create a Connecticut pop star and be like, ""You know what?"
01:50:12;01:50:19;"The world's turned its back on Connecticut for so long that we're not even going to try to break the pop star nationally."
01:50:19;01:50:22;"This pop star, we're going to tour the sh-- out of Connecticut."""
01:50:22;01:50:23;"Regional."
01:50:23;01:50:25;"""We're going to hit all four corners of Connecticut."
01:50:25;01:50:30;"We're going to hit the north, south, east, and west, and we'll tack on Rhode Island because it's small."
01:50:30;01:50:33;"But this is a Connecticut/Rhode Island-based act,"
01:50:33;01:50:39;"and we're going to take some of the valuable lessons from our mentors like Halsey and Cardi B and Michael Bolton."
01:50:39;01:50:43;"But first things first, you've got to keep your side of the street clean."
01:50:43;01:50:45;"You've got to make your bed."""
01:50:45;01:50:46;"I dig it."
01:50:46;01:50:48;"Okay, Connecticut Idol, are we doing this?"
01:50:48;01:50:50;"Maybe we've got to do a roundup."
01:50:50;01:50:52;"The next episode is the last episode of the year."
01:50:52;01:50:55;"We've got to do a roundup of all of our best ideas and see which ones we want to do."
01:50:55;01:50:57;"Because actually, there's one I haven't stopped."
01:50:57;01:51:02;"I know we joke about how we come up with a lot of get-rich-quick schemes on this show, and we rarely follow through with them."
01:51:02;01:51:06;"There's one I've still been thinking about, and it's the Frosted Flakes one."
01:51:06;01:51:12;"Oh, I thought you were going to say the Russian novel based on the '90s sitcom universe."
01:51:12;01:51:13;"Oh, yeah."
01:51:13;01:51:14;"I forgot about that one."
01:51:14;01:51:16;"But the Frosted Flakes one, that's great."
01:51:16;01:51:17;"That's great."
01:51:17;01:51:19;"We'll talk about it more next week, but here's my idea."
01:51:19;01:51:25;"We'll build a house that we can call our own cereal Frosted Flakes because that's not a copyrightable phrase."
01:51:25;01:51:29;"So right there, we've got a name that everybody knows and loves, Frosted Flakes."
01:51:29;01:51:31;"Next step, we just need a cover."
01:51:31;01:51:35;"So we'll go buy some dog [bleep] generic Frosted Flakes."
01:51:35;01:51:36;"We don't need to worry about making it."
01:51:36;01:51:38;"Western family."
01:51:38;01:51:42;"We'll repackage it as Frosted Flakes."
01:51:42;01:51:44;"Well, next thing we need is a cover."
01:51:44;01:51:46;"And I've been thinking about this."
01:51:46;01:51:47;"Okay, well, we have an iconic name."
01:51:47;01:51:48;"We need an iconic cover."
01:51:48;01:51:55;"Okay, well, you know, we can't get Tony the Tiger and we can't afford to get some, you know, famous spokesperson."
01:51:55;01:51:57;"But hold on a second."
01:51:57;01:52:02;"How many iconic works of art are in the public domain because they're old as hell?"
01:52:02;01:52:03;"A lot."
01:52:03;01:52:04;"I was thinking about this."
01:52:04;01:52:06;"This is the first one that popped in my mind."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"We make our own Frosted Flakes."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"It says Frosted Flakes on the box."
01:52:09;01:52:14;"And then the picture is like that Goya painting that Saturn eating his--"
01:52:14;01:52:15;"Okay."
01:52:15;01:52:17;"Yeah, or, you know, just kooky."
01:52:17;01:52:18;"I'm thinking straight up Mona Lisa."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"Maybe straight--"
01:52:20;01:52:21;"I think that's better."
01:52:21;01:52:22;"I agree."
01:52:22;01:52:23;"Okay."
01:52:23;01:52:27;"Or, dude, Sistine Chapel, God's finger touching man's finger."
01:52:27;01:52:28;"I'm into it."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"So dumb."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"Maybe those are our two."
01:52:30;01:52:32;"Mona Lisa and that and just like--"
01:52:32;01:52:33;"How about this?"
01:52:33;01:52:36;"I like Mona Lisa the best because the name is more iconic."
01:52:36;01:52:37;"Yeah."
01:52:37;01:52:44;"And it's Mona Lisa, a high-res image of the Mona Lisa painting and Frosted Flakes and it's Frosted Flakes."
01:52:44;01:52:45;"Okay, Seinfeld, I need you."
01:52:45;01:52:46;"You're going to have a lot of numbers to crunch."
01:52:46;01:52:49;"Just find us some dog [bleep] Frosted Flakes that we can--"
01:52:49;01:52:52;"Maybe there's we can buy in bulk somewhere and we repackage them."
01:52:52;01:52:54;"I got a suggestion."
01:52:54;01:52:59;"We take generic corn flakes and just put some sugar in the box, shake it up, probably cut costs that way."
01:52:59;01:53:01;"And then it's Frosted?"
01:53:01;01:53:04;"Well, I mean, there's sugar and flakes in the box."
01:53:04;01:53:06;"Define Frosted."
01:53:06;01:53:07;"I want to do this one."
01:53:07;01:53:08;"I think that this--"
01:53:08;01:53:12;"We're going to make serious bucks with Mona Lisa Frosted Flakes."
01:53:12;01:53:14;"Frosted Flakes gets on base."
01:53:14;01:53:15;"That's right."
01:53:15;01:53:17;"Frosted Flakes gets us on base."
01:53:17;01:53:18;"Mona Lisa makes it a double."
01:53:18;01:53:20;"I'll take it."
01:53:20;01:53:25;"The number one song in 1995 this week is Mariah Carey's ""One Sweet Day."""
01:53:25;01:53:26;"It's from the same album."
01:53:26;01:53:27;"She had two songs in the top five."
01:53:27;01:53:28;"Oh, cool."
01:53:28;01:53:32;"Also with Boyz II Men."
01:53:32;01:53:35;"Two Boyz II Men features."
01:53:35;01:53:36;"Real slow."
01:53:36;01:53:38;"Big year for R&B."
01:53:38;01:53:39;"Yeah."
01:53:43;01:53:47;"You're kind of surprised there's no alternative rock on there."
01:53:47;01:53:48;"No, all R&B."
01:53:48;01:53:51;"No Bush Glycerine or something."
01:53:52;01:53:59;"All I wanted to say"
01:53:59;01:54:06;"And now it's too late to hold you"
01:54:06;01:54:10;"'Cause you've flown away"
01:54:10;01:54:14;"So far away"
01:54:14;01:54:22;"Never had I imagined"
01:54:22;01:54:29;"Living without your smile"
01:54:29;01:54:36;"Feeling knowing you're here with me"
01:54:36;01:54:40;"It keeps me alive"
01:54:40;01:54:42;"Alive"
01:54:42;01:54:44;"Alright, we don't have a lot of time to listen."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"Alright, Mariah Carey's great."
01:54:45;01:54:50;"The number one song right now is by 6ix9ine, also known as Tekashi69."
01:54:50;01:54:51;"Apparently he's in some kind of trouble."
01:54:51;01:54:53;"I haven't read up on it, but..."
01:54:53;01:54:54;"I have no idea who that is."
01:54:54;01:54:55;"I don't want to."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"I don't think anybody should go to jail for a long time."
01:54:57;01:54:59;"Anyone?"
01:54:59;01:55:00;"Kind of."
01:55:00;01:55:03;"Anyway, he's got the number one song on iTunes right now."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"It's called ""Mama"" featuring Nicki Minaj and Kanye West"
01:55:05;01:55:07;"from his new album, ""Dummy Boy."""
01:55:07;01:55:09;"You remember this guy, Jake?"
01:55:09;01:55:11;"Well, this is cool."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"It is cool."
01:55:12;01:55:14;"It's like flutes."
01:55:14;01:55:18;"As soon as the beat drops, I'm going to hate on you."
01:55:18;01:55:20;"So it's not nice"
01:55:20;01:55:22;"Tiki-taki, Spanish mami, she a hot tamale"
