00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, back once again. On this episode we'll talk new music from the Jonas Brothers,"
00:08;00:16;"new shows from Phish, we'll be joined by Chris Thompson, and we'll get into it."
00:16;00:28;"All of this, plus the greatest hits of 1993. This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:13;01:20;"Alright, Time Crisis back again. Got a big show, we'll be talking some Phish later."
01:20;01:24;"A bunch of us went to the Phish show, but no spoilers, we'll get into that later."
01:24;01:31;"Got Chris Thompson calling in too. First off, Seinfeld, what is this song you've been buzzing about?"
01:31;01:34;"Hey, what's up? Yeah. What are you so excited about?"
01:34;01:39;"Yeah, I just texted the thread on the way to the studio and I just said,"
01:39;01:42;"""Is the Jonas Brothers Waffle House in the top 5?"""
01:42;01:48;"Because I came across this song in the wild this afternoon and I listened to it and I was like,"
01:48;01:53;"""Oh my god, this is a true banger."" And then I was just saying, on the way over,"
01:53;01:57;"I listened to it repeatedly because I got very obsessed very quickly,"
01:57;02:00;"and by the end of the ride here I was just completely over it."
02:00;02:02;"It was too catchy. Too good."
02:02;02:05;"Some songs can be too catchy and you can play them out very quickly."
02:05;02:10;"Right. And also the answer to your question is the song in the top 5 was ""No."""
02:10;02:14;"Yeah, which is surprising to me. That's why we're talking about it now and not saving it for the end."
02:14;02:17;"So, this is a song by the Jonas Brothers called ""Waffle House,"""
02:17;02:21;"so I have to imagine this is a collab with Waffle House."
02:21;02:25;"Maybe they're doing a merch line, maybe doing some funny commercials."
02:25;02:27;"I don't think there's any tie-in. Have you not heard this song?"
02:27;02:30;"No, I haven't heard it. Jake? Not familiar."
02:30;02:33;"I know Nick was blasting it on the way down here too. I was."
02:33;02:38;"Thoughts? I mean, I told you, I was stuck in such terrible traffic and the song is so upbeat."
02:38;02:42;"It definitely had the beginning of a movie sort of energy where, you know,"
02:42;02:45;"someone's stuck in traffic and they're listening to the song and it's getting them through"
02:45;02:50;"and then, you know, there's a big explosion or I'm carjacked or something."
02:50;02:53;"You know what I mean? It's just not saccharine. Let's listen to it."
02:53;02:58;"Okay. I definitely was, at first, when you text a thread and I'm stuck in the traffic"
02:58;03:01;"and you say, ""You guys got to listen to this song right now."""
03:01;03:06;"Also, for you to ask if it's in the top five, only now to learn that it's over a month old."
03:06;03:09;"Okay. Well, sometimes these things are like the grandpa."
03:09;03:11;"I'm sure it's new for a lot of our listeners. Well, alright, let's check it out."
03:11;03:14;"Jonas Brothers with ""Waffle House."""
03:14;03:17;"It's, I guess, it's on their album called ""The Album."""

04:44;04:47;"This is like, it's funny."
04:47;04:49;"- That's the old music critic and edit,"
04:49;04:51;"as we're coming out."
04:51;04:52;"- On the one hand, it's got this sample,"

05:09;05:14;"- True, but also, that sample we think is Michael McDonald,"
05:14;05:16;"I think is generic enough"
05:16;05:18;"that it's not attributed to anybody."
05:18;05:19;"It's just a vibe."

05:42;05:43;"- I mean, I do have to say,"
05:43;05:47;"I think the Jonas Brothers are consistently interesting."
05:47;05:50;"The Jonas Brothers first came out like 15 years ago,"
05:50;05:51;"then they went their separate ways."
05:51;05:53;"Now they're making kind of more mature music."
05:53;05:55;"This song is genuinely surprising."
05:55;05:57;"It's not throwaway pop music."
05:57;05:58;"This is my first listen."

06:06;06:09;"just generic whatever pop."
06:09;06:11;"They do always like punch above."
06:11;06:13;"And even as solo artists, they punch above."
06:13;06:16;"Joe, he had his group that had the hit song,"
06:16;06:18;"""Cake by the Ocean."""
06:18;06:20;"And even then, there's something about that song."
06:20;06:22;"There's something just like a little bit weirder about it"

06:28;06:31;"And then Nick too, his biggest hit as a solo artist"
06:31;06:33;"is the ""Jealous"" song."
06:33;06:34;"- Oh yeah."
06:34;06:36;"- Which actually, sometimes I get confused"
06:36;06:38;"because of my dear friends, Chromio."
06:38;06:40;"One of their biggest songs also called ""Jealous."""
06:40;06:41;"But his is the one,"
06:41;06:43;"like every once in a while I'll hear it somewhere random."
06:43;06:46;"It's like pretty typical pop music about us."
06:46;06:48;"Sometimes he gets jealous because this girl's so beautiful."
06:48;06:50;"But then there's that line,"
06:50;06:52;"♪ It's my right to be hellish ♪"
06:52;06:56;"♪ I still get jealous ♪"

07:13;07:14;"- I don't."
07:14;07:15;"- ♪ You're too sexy ♪"
07:15;07:16;"- I love that couplet."
07:16;07:17;"- While you pull it up,"
07:17;07:20;"I wanna read you from the band's statement about the song."
07:20;07:21;"- Waffle House?"
07:21;07:24;"- Yeah, according to the band's statement."
07:24;07:25;"- There's a statement."
07:25;07:26;"Like an artist statement."
07:26;07:29;"- The artist statement about the song."
07:29;07:32;"Waffle House was born from a simple but powerful idea."
07:32;07:34;"When you sit down with the people that matter most,"
07:34;07:36;"anything is possible."
07:36;07:39;"- Kind of simple but powerful."
07:39;07:40;"- I'm with it, I'm with it."
07:40;07:42;"Anything?"
07:42;07:43;"- I mean, that's one of the core values, I feel."
07:43;07:47;"- This song isn't about a restaurant."
07:47;07:50;"It's about coming together with the people you love"
07:50;07:52;"and making your dreams come true."
07:52;07:53;"- It's beautiful."
07:53;07:55;"- So the song could have been called Burger King."
07:55;07:56;"♪ Burger King ♪"
07:56;07:58;"- It wouldn't have rolled off the tongue."
07:58;08:00;"- Also, it's not not about a restaurant."
08:00;08:03;"We'll see when Waffle House comes with a big fat check"
08:03;08:04;"for the commercial."
08:04;08:06;"- Yeah."
08:06;08:07;"- You sure about that?"
08:07;08:08;"You sure about that, that it's not about a restaurant?"
08:08;08:09;"- That's interesting."
08:09;08:12;"Do you think it's sort of like post that Applebee's song?"
08:12;08:13;"- Exactly."
08:13;08:15;"- That country dude did the Applebee's song"
08:15;08:17;"and then he got the big sink."
08:17;08:19;"- So you think there's something a little cynical"
08:19;08:20;"going on here?"
08:20;08:23;"- No, I'm just saying, I'm sure that the Jonas Brothers"
08:23;08:25;"had that exact conversation saying,"
08:25;08:26;"well, let's call Waffle House."
08:26;08:27;"And then maybe one of them's like,"
08:27;08:29;"is that kind of, that's not really us."
08:29;08:31;"Like this kind of cheeky pop culture reference"
08:31;08:34;"where it's about writing songs about restaurants."
08:34;08:36;"So it seemed like some early talking heads kind of thing."
08:36;08:38;"And then said, no, it's not about a restaurant."
08:38;08:39;"This is about deep emotions."
08:39;08:41;"It's not on some weird David Byrne bullshit."
08:41;08:43;"This is not about buildings and food."
08:43;08:46;"This is about emotions and family."
08:46;08:47;"Okay, all right."
08:47;08:48;"I thought you were taking us in some weird"
08:48;08:49;"early talking heads bullshit."
08:49;08:51;"That's not who the J-Bros are."
08:51;08:53;"- The Waffle House is just a stand in"
08:53;08:55;"for any normal restaurant that you might encounter."
08:55;08:56;"- Okay, right, yeah."
08:56;08:57;"- It could be a chain restaurant."
08:57;08:58;"It could be a mom and pop."
08:58;09:01;"- I don't want this disaffected late seventies,"
09:01;09:04;"downtown New York, hipster punk rock bullshit."
09:04;09:07;"- It's not a critique of suburbia or corporate culture."
09:07;09:09;"It's just, you know."
09:09;09:12;"I'm in there sitting down at the Waffle House."
09:12;09:13;"Okay, all right, so I'm with it."
09:13;09:14;"It's not about a restaurant."
09:14;09:16;"Yeah, I bet they did have that conversation."
09:16;09:19;"All I'm saying is we live in a world of temptation."
09:19;09:22;"And one day Waffle House comes a knock and says,"
09:22;09:25;"hey fellas, how about a $40 million?"
09:25;09:27;"We do a whole thing together."
09:27;09:28;"We just got one question for you."
09:28;09:30;"Your song's about Waffle House, right?"
09:30;09:32;"Sorry, sorry, this is a dumb question."
09:32;09:33;"This is the PR guy."
09:33;09:35;"Sorry."
09:35;09:36;"- I mean, I read your statement."
09:36;09:38;"- I mean, yeah, my boss is making me ask."
09:38;09:40;"I mean, of course the song's called Waffle House."
09:40;09:41;"I know it's about Waffle House,"
09:41;09:43;"but I just got to ask you guys,"
09:43;09:45;"is the song about Waffle House?"
09:45;09:46;"- No."
09:46;09:48;"We're already rich."
09:48;09:50;"- You sure about that, fellas?"
09:50;09:51;"We just went up to 80 million."
09:51;09:56;"You sure about that, that it's not about Waffle House?"
09:56;09:57;"Quickly, Kevin Caves."
09:57;09:59;"Yeah, actually, you know, come on guys."
09:59;10:01;"At first, let's be honest."
10:01;10:02;"When we first sat down, we said,"
10:02;10:04;"let's write a song about Waffle House."
10:04;10:05;"- Here's what happens."
10:05;10:07;"- They start falling like dominoes."
10:07;10:09;"They have a meltdown on the top of a mountain."
10:09;10:10;"They get back on the PJ."
10:10;10:12;"They're around their business managers."
10:12;10:13;"The phone rings."
10:13;10:16;"Waffle House is calling back 150 million."
10:16;10:16;"- Holy (beep)"
10:16;10:19;"- I was about to say. - 150 million."
10:19;10:19;"- I was going to say,"
10:19;10:22;"do you think that Waffle House is 40 million?"
10:22;10:24;"(laughing)"
10:24;10:26;"- This is like the first time"
10:26;10:29;"we did some full drive time radio (beep)"
10:29;10:30;"Just like."
10:30;10:32;"You sure about that?"
10:32;10:34;"- The song's about Waffle House, right?"
10:35;10:36;"- Come on, Nick."
10:36;10:37;"I'm pretty sure you told me"
10:37;10:39;"that the song's about Waffle House."
10:39;10:42;"- Song's about family."
10:42;10:43;"- The song's about family."
10:43;10:45;"- I mean, Kendall Roy does look like"
10:45;10:47;"he could be a Jonas Brother in like another."
10:47;10:48;"- That is true."
10:48;10:49;"- Another world, like the oldest, right?"
10:49;10:51;"- 47 year old Jonas Brother."
10:51;10:53;"(laughing)"
10:53;10:56;"- I was going to say 40 million seemed like a lot,"
10:56;10:56;"but I just looked it up"
10:56;11:00;"and Waffle House makes a billion dollars annually"
11:00;11:01;"in gross revenue."
11:01;11:02;"Surprising."
11:02;11:03;"- What are their costs?"
11:03;11:04;"- How about?"
11:05;11:07;"Okay, Jonas Brothers, for your little song"
11:07;11:09;"that you claim is not about Waffle House,"
11:09;11:12;"how about our entire year's gross revenue?"
11:12;11:15;"One billion dollars."
11:15;11:15;"Sure it's not about Waffle House?"
11:15;11:16;"- Good job, boys."
11:16;11:18;"Good job, boys."
11:18;11:20;"(laughing)"
11:20;11:23;"- I don't even know what the Jonas Brothers dad is like."
11:23;11:24;"- I mean, Logan Roy."
11:24;11:25;"- He's Logan Roy."
11:25;11:27;"He's an old Scottish man."
11:27;11:28;"- Logan Jonas."
11:28;11:29;"- Yes."
11:29;11:31;"- Can I ask one question about Waffle House?"
11:31;11:33;"Just want to get your take on it."
11:33;11:35;"Can I ask you to play like the first five, six seconds?"
11:35;11:37;"- Of the succession theme?"
11:37;11:38;"- No, no, no, of the Waffle House song."
11:38;11:39;"No, no, no."
11:39;11:41;"I thought I'd do like that succession theme."
11:41;11:43;"- Okay, you want the Waffle House song?"
11:43;11:45;"- Yeah, just run it back."
11:47;11:53;"I think this is why it was too,"
11:53;11:55;"it was so catchy because of this ""hey now."""
11:55;11:57;"But what, this is my question."
11:57;11:58;"What accent is that?"
11:58;12:01;"'Cause I'm saying like Mennonite or like Amish."
12:01;12:04;"- It sounds very much like, ""Hey now."""
12:04;12:05;"- Like, ""Hey now."""
12:05;12:07;"Well, okay, actually that raises an interesting question"
12:07;12:09;"'cause I've met Joe over the years."
12:09;12:10;"I always really liked him."
12:10;12:13;"And I always did think the Jonas Brothers were cut above."
12:13;12:16;"But one point of pride for me"
12:16;12:19;"as a person who mostly grew up in New Jersey,"
12:19;12:23;"and I always clock people who are from the Garden State,"
12:23;12:26;"is that the Jonas Brothers, they're from Wyckoff, New Jersey."
12:26;12:28;"And that's a town that I actually spent some time in"
12:28;12:31;"'cause I was in a acid jazz band"
12:31;12:33;"when I was 14."
12:33;12:35;"And some of the members were from Wyckoff."
12:35;12:37;"- What was the name of that band?"
12:37;12:38;"- Groove Prophecy."
12:38;12:39;"- Sick name."
12:39;12:40;"- Have we ever talked about this?"
12:40;12:41;"- I don't think we ever talked about it."
12:41;12:43;"I was not in the driver's seat."
12:43;12:46;"My friend and kind of older dude, Raj,"
12:46;12:48;"who as actually called in the show before,"
12:48;12:50;"he was a senior and I was a freshman"
12:50;12:54;"as was Wes, Miles, Rara Riot fam."
12:54;12:56;"We were playing saxophone."
12:56;12:57;"We played some fun songs."
12:57;13:00;"The Gray Boy All Stars."
13:00;13:01;"Just up there on saxophone."
13:01;13:03;"(scatting)"
13:03;13:05;"And then the keyboardist was from our town,"
13:05;13:08;"but then his cousin was a dude from Wyckoff."
13:08;13:11;"And he was a very kind of crunchy guy."
13:11;13:13;"And so all the people I ever met from Wyckoff,"
13:13;13:15;"and I went to a couple of parties or something,"
13:15;13:17;"I was always like, oh, this is like a very,"
13:17;13:19;"this is jam band country."
13:19;13:21;"The actor also who played Little Pete"
13:21;13:23;"on the Adventures of Pete and Pete,"
13:23;13:25;"if you're a '90s kid,"
13:25;13:27;"he was also, I think, lived in that town."
13:27;13:29;"He was a very crunchy dude."
13:29;13:30;"So anyway, I was interested to hear"
13:30;13:34;"that the Jonas Brothers came out of this town, Wyckoff,"
13:34;13:37;"because I actually had musical associations with it."
13:37;13:40;"Randomly, I met people older who were also from Wyckoff,"
13:40;13:42;"and they're always kind of like into funk"
13:42;13:44;"and jam bands and stuff."
13:44;13:46;"Whatever, that's my limited experience of Wyckoff."
13:46;13:48;"So anyway, I clocked it that the Jonas Brothers"
13:48;13:50;"were from Wyckoff, and I was like,"
13:50;13:51;"look at this, some Jersey boys from a town"
13:51;13:53;"I already associate with music."
13:53;13:56;"Maybe they got a little crunch in them, I don't know."
13:56;13:58;"But anyway, I associate them with being from New Jersey."
13:58;13:59;"And not just any part of New Jersey,"
13:59;14:04;"northern New Jersey, the part that kind of circles Manhattan."
14:04;14:06;"So anyway, it's got me wondering,"
14:06;14:08;"A, what's the accent they're going for on the song,"
14:08;14:11;"and B, are there Waffle Houses in New Jersey?"
14:11;14:12;"Where are there Waffle Houses?"
14:12;14:14;"'Cause I never came across one."
14:14;14:17;"I was going to IHOP, New Jersey's IHOP country,"
14:17;14:20;"or realistically, your local diner."
14:20;14:21;"- Local Greek diner."
14:21;14:22;"- Local Greek diner."
14:22;14:25;"- Well, also, according to the statement"
14:25;14:26;"from the Jonas Brothers for Waffle House,"
14:26;14:28;"growing up, quote, ""Growing up,"
14:28;14:31;"""we would go to Waffle House after shows,"
14:31;14:34;"""and it became our sanctuary,"" said Joe, Nick, and Kevin"
14:34;14:35;"in the press release."
14:35;14:37;"""It was the place we dreamt up ideas,"
14:37;14:39;"""the place we worked through our problems together,"
14:39;14:42;"""and the place where we finally realized"
14:42;14:44;"""we could find our own way through anything,"
14:44;14:46;"""as long as we came together."""
14:46;14:48;"- So maybe this is on a tour, when they're touring."
14:48;14:51;"- Right, touring the deep south."
14:51;14:52;"- Yeah, 'cause there's zero."
14:52;14:54;"- There's zero Waffle Houses in New Jersey."
14:54;14:56;"- There's Waffle Houses in LA, though."
14:56;14:57;"- Sure."
14:57;14:58;"- So, I mean, maybe they're--"
14:58;14:59;"- Right, I guess, yeah, 'cause I guess--"
14:59;15:01;"- Not in the northeast, but throughout the south."
15:01;15:02;"- Okay, so it tracks."
15:02;15:03;"- Southwest."
15:03;15:04;"- They were some Jersey boys"
15:04;15:07;"hitting probably local Greek diners,"
15:07;15:08;"coming up with no good ideas,"
15:08;15:10;"occasionally hitting an IHOP."
15:10;15:15;"Then mom or dad takes them to LA to become Disney stars."
15:15;15:18;"They eat Waffle House for the first time in Los Angeles."
15:18;15:20;"Suddenly, the ideas are flowing."
15:20;15:22;"Then they start, become these huge pop stars"
15:22;15:24;"at a very young age."
15:24;15:25;"They were like 12 or something?"
15:25;15:26;"- Something crazy. - I don't know."
15:26;15:28;"So then they're touring."
15:28;15:33;"They're selling out stadiums in Dallas, Nashville,"
15:33;15:35;"Little Rock, Arkansas, and--"
15:35;15:39;"- Shreveport, Louisiana, hitting that Waffle House 2 a.m."
15:39;15:42;"- They just did 25K tickets in Shreveport."
15:42;15:45;"Then they're asking their minder,"
15:45;15:46;"can we please get some Waffle House?"
15:46;15:48;"Yeah, all right, so they were well-traveled, all right."
15:48;15:50;"They weren't eating it in Jersey, but this is--"
15:50;15:51;"- It tracks."
15:51;15:52;"- They associate this with actually"
15:52;15:54;"them coming into their own."
15:54;15:57;"They left that Jersey diner bull (beep) behind."
15:57;15:59;"Waffle House is where they kind of came together"
15:59;16:01;"as a band and as men."
16:01;16:06;"- The brand resonates in their deep emotional core."
16:06;16:08;"It's deep."
16:08;16:10;"- And it sounds better than IHOP."
16:10;16:13;"- Well, yeah, it's a good restaurant name"
16:13;16:15;"'cause it's broad enough where it's like,"
16:15;16:18;"if you don't know it's a chain, it works."
16:18;16:19;"- Yeah."
16:19;16:22;"- Sort of like Wrigley's Field or something."
16:22;16:25;"- Right, it just sounds, it says Wrigley Field."
16:25;16:25;"- You're right."
16:25;16:27;"- Wait, is it Wrigley's Field?"
16:27;16:28;"- No, it's Wrigley Field."
16:28;16:29;"- Wait, is it named after Wrigley Gum?"
16:29;16:32;"- Yeah, but it's so old that it kind of--"
16:32;16:33;"- Right, well, it's kind of like we used to talk"
16:33;16:35;"about Staples Center in LA."
16:35;16:36;"- Right, Staples, exactly. - Just sounds good."
16:36;16:37;"- Waffle House."
16:37;16:40;"I had a thought on what, I know it's not a sample,"
16:40;16:43;"but it's very close to Jackson Browne."
16:43;16:46;"♪ She's got to be somebody's baby ♪"
16:46;16:47;"- Oh, yeah, yeah, I could see that."
16:47;16:51;"♪ She's got to be somebody's baby ♪"
16:53;16:57;"- Yeah, maybe they even started with a sample of this"
16:57;16:58;"and then they changed it a little bit."
16:58;16:59;"- Right, a little bit."
17:02;17:07;"- This song calls me to be really sad whenever I hear it."
17:07;17:12;"♪ Look at that girl with the lights coming up in her eyes ♪"
17:12;17:19;"♪ She's got to be somebody's baby ♪"

17:36;17:38;"(laughing)"
17:38;17:40;"- Don't approach her, don't talk to her."
17:40;17:42;"- Just looking around at beautiful women,"
17:42;17:45;"just be like, ""She's probably got a Chad boyfriend."""
17:45;17:47;"- Oh my God, I'm such a loser."
17:47;17:50;"♪ She's somebody's only light ♪"
17:50;17:52;"♪ Gonna shine tonight ♪"
17:52;17:57;"♪ Yeah, she's probably somebody's baby ♪"
17:57;17:58;"- Is this used in Boogie Nights?"
17:58;18:02;"- It's not in Boogie Nights, but it could have been."
18:02;18:05;"- This is a limiting thought, is what this is."
18:05;18:07;"A limiting thought as a song."
18:07;18:08;"- Sort of the opposite of awful."
18:08;18:09;"- Jackson Brown is a suppressive person."
18:09;18:10;"- Oh wait, but listen to this."
18:10;18:14;"He heard her talking to a friend when nobody was there"
18:14;18:17;"and she said, ""She's got to be somebody's baby."""
18:17;18:20;"- Like she's saying actually she needs to be somebody's baby."
18:20;18:25;"♪ Light up the town ♪"
18:25;18:29;"♪ She's got to be somebody's baby ♪"
18:29;18:30;"♪ She knows she needs somebody's baby ♪"

18:31;18:33;"She must be someone's baby either means--"
18:33;18:35;"♪ Gonna shine tonight ♪"
18:35;18:37;"- She definitely is somebody's baby"
18:37;18:40;"or she must be someone's baby soon."
18:40;18:42;"- And that song you really hear"
18:42;18:44;"why Jackson Brown and Glenn Frey were friends."
18:45;18:47;"Just like the guy who's kind of sitting"
18:47;18:49;"at the edge of the bar, kind of holding a tequila."
18:49;18:50;"- Yeah."
18:50;18:51;"- Just like, I'm just soaking this all in."
18:51;18:52;"- Yeah."
18:52;18:54;"- Look at this human comedy in front of me."
18:54;18:55;"I'm just gonna--"
18:55;18:56;"- Two great observers."
18:56;18:57;"(laughing)"
18:57;18:58;"- I'm gonna participate"
18:58;19:01;"and I'm gonna observe at the same time."
19:01;19:03;"- Yeah, no, this all might have been come out"
19:03;19:05;"of a night at Dan Tannis."
19:05;19:08;"Just like many great Eagles songs."
19:08;19:10;"But now let's listen back to Waffle House."
19:10;19:11;"- Yeah."

19:24;19:27;"But no, it sounds K-pop above all."
19:27;19:28;"(laughing)"
19:28;19:29;"- Sounds BTS."
19:29;19:33;"I'm just getting, I'm getting Amish."
19:33;19:34;"- Amish, what is Amish?"
19:34;19:37;"- Hey now, like, we're gonna raise the barn."
19:37;19:38;"- Yeah."

20:33;20:34;"as we listen to it."
20:34;20:37;"Now I can actually picture them being like 15,"
20:37;20:40;"having some like dumb ass fight about like--"
20:40;20:41;"- God."
20:41;20:43;"- Nick, you missed your cue."
20:43;20:45;"- Or like, dude, can you imagine being really famous"
20:45;20:48;"and 15 and you're with two brothers?"
20:48;20:49;"- Crazy."
20:49;20:50;"- I mean, you're already at your brother's throat"
20:50;20:51;"when you're a teenager."
20:51;20:54;"I mean, add fame and money and pressure to that mix."
20:54;20:57;"- I bet they probably did sit at a Waffle House"
20:57;21:02;"outside of Shreveport and like actually hash some stuff out."
21:02;21:04;"And like by the end, really were just like,"
21:04;21:05;"the (beep) of you guys."
21:05;21:08;"- Stone cold sober."
21:08;21:09;"- Just-- - Yeah."
21:09;21:11;"- Nine Dr. Peppers deep."
21:11;21:12;"(laughing)"
21:12;21:14;"And like, their handler is just sitting in the Sprinter van"
21:14;21:15;"like out in the parking lot."
21:15;21:19;"Just like, oh my God, what am I doing with my life?"
21:19;21:21;"Watching these kids like,"
21:21;21:23;"hug it out in the Waffle House at 2 a.m."
21:23;21:25;"- And it says they wrote it."
21:25;21:28;"Jonas Brothers, they always consistently beat expectations"
21:28;21:32;"and I would love to see them like get weird."
21:32;21:34;"If they're gonna keep doing this brothers thing"
21:34;21:36;"for the rest of their lives, like--"
21:36;21:38;"- Yeah, go Beach Boys on it, man."
21:38;21:41;"- Yeah, like a psychedelic album or just a,"
21:41;21:44;"I'm sure they've got enough money for a lifetime."
21:44;21:46;"Just get into some like, get into something strange."
21:46;21:49;"- I can't in good conscience let the show continue"
21:49;21:50;"without calling out, Jake,"
21:50;21:53;"you said that there were Waffle Houses in LA."
21:53;21:55;"I'm seeing no California locations."
21:55;21:57;"- Really, am I hallucinating?"
21:57;21:58;"- Maybe you're thinking of the famous"
21:58;22:00;"Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles."
22:00;22:02;"That's a famous LA thing."
22:02;22:04;"- There may have been some before that have shut down."
22:04;22:05;"- Why am I--"
22:05;22:07;"- And I don't wanna show you up, I just,"
22:07;22:09;"I feel like people rely on the show."
22:09;22:12;"- I think you should, as the ombudsman,"
22:12;22:13;"what's the word?"
22:13;22:14;"- Ombudsman."
22:15;22:18;"- As the, as the ombudsman."
22:18;22:19;"- That's a funny word."
22:19;22:21;"- That's a tough one, say that five times."
22:21;22:22;"As the ombudsman of the show."
22:22;22:23;"- Couldn't do it."
22:23;22:24;"- As the number cruncher."
22:24;22:26;"- Oh, people rely on the show for news information"
22:26;22:28;"and I just felt compelled."
22:28;22:30;"- Someone right there, they just heard about"
22:30;22:33;"a brand new month old song from the Jonas Brothers"
22:33;22:35;"and they're learning about the great brand Waffle House."
22:35;22:37;"So where are most of the Waffle Houses?"
22:37;22:38;"- It's a southern thing, right?"
22:38;22:39;"- Yeah, I mean--"
22:39;22:40;"- Have you been to a Waffle House?"
22:40;22:41;"- Not personally, never."
22:41;22:42;"- I have, yeah."
22:42;22:44;"Ohio, I've been to one."
22:44;22:46;"I feel like somewhere else."
22:46;22:50;"I'm really experiencing a weird sense of displacement"
22:50;22:53;"that there's not any Waffle Houses in LA."
22:53;22:53;"- As I said, they may have shut down."
22:53;22:56;"- Maybe you're thinking Cracker Barrel, which--"
22:56;22:58;"- No, they have that all over."
22:58;22:58;"- Cracker Barrel."
22:58;23:00;"- But no, they haven't been all over."
23:00;23:00;"- Terrible restaurant."
23:00;23:02;"- There is one in LA, what?"
23:02;23:04;"- Cracker Barrel is the worst meal I've ever had."
23:04;23:04;"- Really?"
23:04;23:05;"- I love a Cracker Barrel."
23:05;23:06;"- I love Cracker Barrel."
23:06;23:08;"- There's a Cracker Barrel ghost kitchen, I believe."
23:08;23:09;"- Wait, yeah."
23:09;23:10;"- At the Cracker Barrel?"
23:10;23:11;"- I don't know."
23:11;23:13;"I'm dislocated here."
23:13;23:16;"- I'm saying there may have been back in the day--"
23:16;23:17;"- Jake, maybe you're thinking of the restaurant,"
23:17;23:21;"The Waffle on Sunset Boulevard."
23:21;23:22;"- House of Pies?"
23:22;23:23;"- No."
23:23;23:25;"- I think--"
23:25;23:25;"- I know what you mean."
23:25;23:30;"- Reality and imagery that I see on a computer screen"
23:30;23:34;"are just merging into one and I can't tell the difference."
23:34;23:35;"- Okay, so where are all the Waffle Houses?"
23:35;23:37;"- So they're in 25 states."
23:37;23:39;"We got Waffle Houses--"
23:39;23:41;"- Where are we doing big numbers?"
23:41;23:43;"- Definitely across the South, Bible Belt."
23:43;23:45;"- Where's the first Waffle House?"
23:45;23:46;"- I believe it's in Georgia."
23:46;23:47;"- That's a nice tie in."
23:47;23:49;"We added a little corporate food history."
23:49;23:51;"- Not deliberate, but yeah, why not?"
23:51;23:52;"- My memory, tell me if I'm right,"
23:52;23:55;"my memory is that it's in the first Waffle House."
23:55;23:57;"It's outside of Atlanta, Georgia."
23:57;23:59;"- It's in Avondale Estates."
23:59;24:01;"It's part of the Atlanta metro."
24:01;24:02;"Wait, so Nick, you used to live in Atlanta."
24:02;24:03;"- Yes, I've been to the original Waffle House."
24:03;24:05;"- And you were hitting Waffle Houses regularly?"
24:05;24:06;"- Regularly."
24:06;24:08;"- Now, is it unique to the Jonas Brothers"
24:08;24:10;"that they were having deep conversations there"
24:10;24:12;"or did you find yourself as an Atlanta resident"
24:12;24:14;"also being drawn to the Waffle House"
24:14;24:18;"when it was time to really get real?"
24:18;24:20;"- No, it's definitely a place you get real"
24:20;24:24;"'cause it's open 24 hours and people are pretty drunk there."
24:24;24:27;"I mean, I would go pretty regularly after like a tear."
24:27;24:29;"You know, I think you're out there, there's a lot of fights."
24:29;24:30;"I mean, that's where you see"
24:30;24:32;"most TikToker fights in Waffle Houses."
24:32;24:33;"- I think that's where the Jonas"
24:33;24:35;"maybe might've gotten some inspiration here"
24:35;24:36;"'cause over the past year,"
24:36;24:38;"it feels like Waffle House has kind of come up as a--"
24:38;24:40;"- And it's usually fight videos."
24:40;24:41;"- Right, fight videos."
24:41;24:42;"And usually with the people working there,"
24:42;24:45;"we'll be defending the cash register,"
24:45;24:47;"throwing somebody over a counter or something like that."
24:47;24:49;"- And I guess it ties in 'cause in the song,"
24:49;24:50;"Jonas Brothers said, ""There were times"
24:50;24:52;"""we tried to kill each other."""
24:52;24:54;"So maybe that's not hyperbole."
24:54;24:56;"- There used to be a couple more Jonas Brothers."
24:56;24:58;"(laughing)"
24:58;25:00;"Well, we know."
25:00;25:04;"- Jason Jonas met an untimely end"
25:04;25:08;"in the Avondale Estates Waffle House in Georgia."
25:08;25:10;"- They don't bring him up too often."
25:10;25:12;"- This is a cool song."
25:12;25:14;"I'm very glad you brought this to our attention."
25:14;25:16;"- Well, I'm feeling vindicated 'cause I think,"
25:16;25:18;"you know, I was also surprised."
25:18;25:20;"I was like, I heard it and I was like, ""Oh, Jonas Brothers?"""
25:20;25:22;"- It's funny, it's so BTS."
25:22;25:25;"I can't totally explain why, but it's like--"
25:25;25:26;"♪ Hit 'em ♪"
25:26;25:29;"♪ Couple nights, threw gasoline on the fly ♪"
25:29;25:30;"- Well, maybe Doug Marsh produced."

25:39;25:39;"We never knew how to what?"
25:39;25:42;"- We never knew how to perfect."
25:42;25:43;"- Okay, that's what he said."
25:43;25:45;"- They're even getting in a little bit to like--"
25:45;25:46;"- We never knew how to perfect."
25:46;25:47;"- Yeah, a little ESL."
25:47;25:51;"That delivery is totally like when K-pop people"
25:51;25:54;"do their kind of R&B pop delivery."
25:54;25:56;"There's a move I always see in K-pop videos"
25:56;25:58;"where the guy kind of goes, ""Heh,"""
25:58;26:00;"and like tilts his head up."
26:00;26:01;"I know this is difficult to describe"
26:01;26:03;"and people can't see my face,"
26:03;26:04;"but you know like one of the dudes"
26:04;26:06;"is kind of like being like kind of like fun"
26:06;26:07;"and then kind of like the guy"
26:07;26:10;"who's like a little bit like saucy comes at his head."
26:10;26:12;"I mean, it's his right to be hellish."
26:12;26:13;"It is a kind of, ""Heh."""
26:13;26:15;"- Yeah, there's always the Chris Kirkpatrick"
26:15;26:17;"kind of like bad boy."
26:17;26:18;"(laughing)"
26:18;26:20;"- And then like, you know, there's that like K-pop move"
26:20;26:23;"where the guy hits his head back a little bit like,"
26:23;26:25;"you know, it's very Michael Jackson."
26:25;26:26;"- It's a trope."
26:26;26:28;"- It's a trope, but I can't believe I'm saying this."
26:28;26:29;"These are guys from New Jersey,"
26:29;26:31;"but this song, there's too much English."
26:31;26:33;"We need a Korean verse in here."
26:33;26:36;"- I mean, it feels ripe for a remix."
26:36;26:39;"- Ooh, BTS remix on this?"
26:39;26:40;"- Be sick. - That's a good idea."
26:40;26:40;"- Is it the production?"
26:40;26:43;"'Cause the notes, everything's very clean"
26:43;26:45;"and very like quantized or something."
26:45;26:47;"- Well, I mean-- - It feels very comped."
26:47;26:48;"- Right, yeah."
26:48;26:49;"- Sure, but that's all pop music now."
26:49;26:50;"I mean--"
26:50;26:51;"- No, but to the point where it's like--"
26:51;26:53;"- K-pop is huge."
26:53;26:54;"There's all sorts of different vibes,"
26:54;26:57;"but when I think of like,"
26:57;26:59;"it reminds me of particularly, I think,"
26:59;27:01;"this big, big BTS song."

27:59;28:03;"but this is the first time I've heard an American song"
28:03;28:04;"that to me sounded like K-pop."
28:04;28:08;"'Cause normally when you talk with like adults about K-pop,"
28:08;28:11;"a lot of people, especially silverback millennials,"
28:11;28:12;"Gen Xers, a lot of people,"
28:12;28:14;"but people be like,"
28:14;28:17;"this just sounds like a copying American R&B or pop."
28:17;28:18;"I'm not saying that's a fair perspective."
28:18;28:20;"That's what you hear a lot."
28:20;28:22;"Older people being like, I mean, the videos are cool,"
28:22;28:26;"but they focus on how K-pop sounds like American music,"
28:26;28:27;"but this sounds like K-pop."

28:29;28:30;"♪ Oh, something got us set ♪"

28:36;28:38;"- I mean, it makes sense, you know."
28:38;28:41;"There's huge global culture."
28:41;28:42;"- Global culture, man."

28:46;28:48;"♪ We try to kill each other ♪"
28:48;28:50;"- I mean, there's gonna be like a K-pop song"
28:50;28:54;"that's influenced by this on some subtle level."
28:54;28:57;"- Are you guys surprised that this is not in the top five?"
28:57;28:58;"'Cause it does feel like--"
28:58;28:59;"- How's the song doing?"
28:59;29:02;"Where did it chart on Billboard?"
29:02;29:02;"- Oh my goodness."
29:02;29:05;"- Maybe K-pop was gonna be like,"
29:05;29:08;"we should mine Jackson Brown from the '80s more."
29:08;29:11;"- All right, so on Billboard,"
29:11;29:16;"the song peaked on the mainstream top 40 at 24."
29:16;29:17;"- That's a bummer."
29:17;29:18;"- Okay, well-- - That is a bummer."
29:18;29:20;"- This has got number one written all over it."
29:20;29:21;"I don't know what--"
29:21;29:22;"- You know what I would say if I worked with them?"
29:22;29:26;"I'd say, okay guys, it peaked at 24."
29:26;29:28;"I'm thinking with a little bit of a TikTok viral moment,"
29:28;29:30;"we get to top 10."
29:30;29:30;"- Yeah."
29:30;29:32;"- So let's get to it, boys."
29:32;29:32;"- Some sound advice."
29:32;29:33;"- Let's get to it."
29:33;29:36;"- Also, go get an Abraha at the Waffle House."
29:36;29:39;"- Can I make a prediction right here, right now?"
29:39;29:41;"Could this be on a bit of a sleeper path"
29:41;29:43;"to ""Song of the Summer""?"
29:43;29:43;"- Ooh, I like that."
29:43;29:44;"- Ooh, slow burn."
29:44;29:46;"- Slow burn, but then it explodes."
29:46;29:47;"You hear it everywhere."
29:47;29:48;"July, July 4th?"
29:48;29:49;"- Oh, dude. - Yeah."
29:49;29:51;"- Number whippin' burgers, crackin' brews."
29:51;29:52;"- Are there examples of songs that have--"
29:52;29:53;"- At the Waffle House."
29:53;29:55;"- Have done that, have done a slow build?"
29:55;29:57;"- I feel like-- - Of course, of course."
29:57;29:59;"- Okay, I think this one might be,"
29:59;30:01;"might not be over."
30:01;30:01;"- That happens all the time."
30:01;30:04;"- What month did ""It's Gettin' Hot in Here"""
30:04;30:04;"by Nelly come out?"
30:04;30:05;"- Oh, good question."
30:05;30:08;"- That was definitely a big summer song."
30:08;30:11;"- That was summer '02, actually."
30:11;30:11;"- Was it?"
30:11;30:12;"Oh, okay."
30:12;30:13;"- Yeah, 'cause I remember-- - Early '02s."
30:13;30:15;"- I remember at my high school graduation party--"
30:15;30:17;"- I think of that as like hearing that song"
30:17;30:19;"and being like, it's gonna be a cool summer."
30:19;30:20;"- Okay. (laughing)"
30:20;30:22;"- It's gonna be a hot summer."
30:22;30:24;"- May 7th."
30:24;30:25;"- Okay, okay."
30:25;30:27;"- It's the first number one."
30:27;30:30;"- That seems like perfect timing for the remix, right?"
30:30;30:33;"If we get a mid-May remix song in the summer."
30:33;30:36;"- I mean, I think this song's got a lot of juice left in it."
30:36;30:39;"And I also wanna say, if we're doing this show,"
30:39;30:41;"if we're still doing ""Time Crisis"" in a couple months"
30:41;30:43;"and this song is number one."
30:43;30:43;"- What are you saying?"
30:43;30:44;"(laughing)"
30:44;30:45;"- I don't know what I'm saying."
30:45;30:47;"I phrased it weird and then I went with it."
30:47;30:48;"- If we're doing a live ""Crisis."""
30:48;30:50;"- If we're doing a live ""Crisis,"" thank you."
30:50;30:51;"And this song is number one."
30:51;30:52;"- Live?"
30:52;30:54;"- I want... (laughing)"
30:54;30:54;"- He's getting more confusing."
30:54;30:56;"- Note the time."
30:56;30:57;"I'm calling it now."
30:57;30:58;"- Okay."
30:58;30:59;"- I'm saying."
30:59;31:00;"- What do you want?"
31:00;31:02;"You want like a pat on the back or?"
31:02;31:03;"- Oh, that's a good question."
31:03;31:06;"Yeah, a pat, like a literal pat on the back."
31:06;31:08;"- Okay. - Okay."
31:08;31:09;"Low stakes, I like it."

31:22;31:24;"So, you know, we all know the Steve Wynwood,"

32:22;32:23;"- Who is this by?"
32:23;32:24;"- Some real."
32:24;32:25;"- Rids."
32:25;32:27;"He's like a Euro DJ."
32:27;32:31;"- Not to be confused with the Blackwater CEO, Eric Prince."
32:31;32:32;"(laughing)"
32:32;32:33;"- It's his DJ name."
32:33;32:34;"- Okay."
32:34;32:37;"No, I know it's weird, dude,"
32:37;32:41;"but one of the biggest mercenary companies,"
32:41;32:43;"the guy also DJs on the side."
32:43;32:44;"He's pretty good."
32:44;32:48;"- Now there's the Goldman Sachs guy who DJs."
32:55;32:59;"- I think we can do a sped up Waffle House mashup with this."

33:10;33:11;"- Yeah."
33:11;33:12;"- Okay."
33:22;33:47;"It's just like it drops and the beat like it like does a few drops and it comes back"
33:47;33:49;"a few times and that's it."
33:49;33:50;"Yeah."
33:50;33:51;"Wow."
33:51;33:52;"Respect."
33:52;34:13;"Have we discussed, sorry just one quick thing."
34:13;34:21;"Have we discussed in the show, Valerie was like a big part of that tour that we did in"
34:21;34:22;"2005?"
34:22;34:27;"Yeah, yeah, because I would have thought that I would have been playing the Eric Prydz song"
34:27;34:28;"on tour."
34:28;34:30;"See, that's where I thought you would have heard it."
34:30;34:34;"Because I feel like this ""Call On Me"" song got me into Valerie."
34:34;34:39;"So I just remember us listening to Valerie by Steve Winwood off like an iPod or something."
34:39;34:41;"At least once a day, probably twice."
34:41;34:43;"That must have been my iPod."
34:43;34:48;"It's probably like the theme of the tour."
34:48;34:50;"I didn't know this song before Eric Prydz."
34:50;34:54;"I remember Joe Grimm was just like not feeling us."
34:54;34:55;"Pissed."
34:55;35:00;"And I remember James, another member of the touring party."
35:00;35:01;"Not down."
35:01;35:03;"Was particularly not down with Destiny's Child."
35:03;35:04;"Oh right."
35:04;35:06;"That was a real changing of the guard moment."
35:06;35:07;"A lot of Usher too."
35:07;35:08;"Yeah, and Usher."
35:08;35:19;"""Call on me"" of that one."
35:19;35:25;"I do remember like parking the minivan in back of the Neuralux in Boise and just like"
35:25;35:30;"leaving the car on and just like blasting this but unloading the gear."
35:30;35:35;"This would be a sick walk-on song."
35:35;35:36;"Yeah."
35:36;35:43;"Got a great voice."
35:43;36:05;"All right."
36:05;36:07;"Now to the main event."
36:07;36:13;"Last weekend, Phish came to Los Angeles with a three night sold out run at the Hollywood"
36:13;36:17;"Bowl as part of their little West Coast run."
36:17;36:19;"I didn't realize that was the last show of their tour."
36:19;36:20;"Little."
36:20;36:21;"Just their little run."
36:21;36:22;"Well, they started in Seattle."
36:22;36:25;"Did a couple shows, Berkeley."
36:25;36:27;"A few in LA."
36:27;36:28;"That's kind of it."
36:28;36:29;"Maybe I'm missing something."
36:29;36:30;"No Portland?"
36:30;36:32;"I don't think so."
36:32;36:34;"For Phish, this was a short run."
36:34;36:35;"That's kind of shocking."
36:35;36:38;"Yeah, because I think in the summer they do like their bigger..."
36:38;36:39;"Gorge."
36:39;36:40;"Yeah, they're hitting the gorge."
36:40;36:44;"This whole run was eight shows, two in Seattle, three in Berkeley and three at the Hollywood"
36:44;36:45;"Bowl."
36:45;36:46;"Wow."
36:46;36:47;"So it was almost a full TC crew."
36:47;36:49;"Nick, you couldn't come."
36:49;36:50;"I was in Vegas with my son."
36:50;36:52;"Nick was teaching his son how to gamble."
36:52;36:53;"Yes."
36:53;36:55;"Wait, because what were you singing?"
36:55;36:57;"We were singing John Mulaney."
36:57;36:58;"You chose comedy."
36:58;36:59;"We chose comedy over music."
36:59;37:00;"You chose comedy over music."
37:00;37:01;"Fair enough."
37:02;37:07;"To be fair, long story short, we had bought these tickets for my son's birthday."
37:07;37:11;"Max had turned 11 a long time ago and then he canceled the show."
37:11;37:13;"So he said, ""Oh, that was his birthday gift."
37:13;37:14;"We're not going to do it."""
37:14;37:17;"And then they said, ""Oh, he's actually going to play this weekend."""
37:17;37:18;"About a month ago."
37:18;37:21;"So he said, ""Oh, we're free."""
37:21;37:22;"And that was before I got the TC call."
37:22;37:27;"Not that it wasn't an amazing trip, but it was before you wrote and said, ""Closing Night"
37:27;37:28;"of Phish."""
37:28;37:29;"Because I was very excited."
37:29;37:33;"I was so excited, I thought I could make the drive back from Vegas and drop Max off and"
37:33;37:35;"go straight to Phish."
37:35;37:36;"But I think that was too ambitious."
37:36;37:37;"Yeah."
37:37;37:39;"But no, I chose comedy over music."
37:39;37:40;"Fair enough."
37:40;37:41;"But you've also already seen Phish."
37:41;37:42;"I have seen Phish."
37:42;37:43;"I think you told the story on the show."
37:43;37:45;"You got kicked out of a Phish show in the '90s."
37:45;37:46;"I did."
37:46;37:47;"Wait, remind me why."
37:47;37:49;"I don't know if I told it on the show."
37:49;37:51;"I texted you guys."
37:51;38:01;"I mean, I mentioned during Dave Matthews that just the vibe of a Phish show in '96, '97,"
38:01;38:03;"it definitely felt harsher."
38:03;38:08;"I'm sure there was kind vibes, but there definitely was a lot seen."
38:08;38:10;"I just had taken ... Someone had given me mushrooms."
38:10;38:14;"I remember being in some van that I didn't know the people."
38:14;38:18;"I entered the scene pretty wild."
38:18;38:21;"And my seats were pretty high up."
38:21;38:24;"And I wanted to get to the floor."
38:24;38:31;"And I thought I could get around the security."
38:31;38:35;"And I tried to jump over a level."
38:35;38:36;"And I fell."
38:36;38:38;"And I literally fell down."
38:38;38:39;"In an arena?"
38:39;38:40;"Yeah."
38:40;38:44;"I think it was at the Cap Center, where if you guys have ever seen Heavy Metal Parking"
38:44;38:48;"Lot about the Dokken show, it takes place at the Cap Center."
38:48;38:49;"Oh, really?"
38:49;38:50;"Oh, I didn't know that."
38:50;38:53;"I was so excited to go to arena shows."
38:53;38:55;"I tried to get around it, and I was so fucked up."
38:55;39:00;"I was like, ""Oh, I can jump over this sort of ... I don't know how to describe it, but"
39:00;39:01;"you're in an arena."""
39:01;39:04;"I'm like, ""I can get around these seats if I just sort of jump over it."""
39:04;39:08;"And I tripped, and I sort of fell down just hundreds of concrete steps."
39:08;39:09;"I mean, I just sort of rolled down."
39:09;39:10;"Jesus, dude."
39:10;39:11;"Oh."
39:11;39:12;"But you're 16 years old."
39:12;39:16;"I know, totally."
39:16;39:20;"And I got to the floor, and everybody was cheering for me."
39:20;39:22;"And so I felt really excited."
39:22;39:28;"And I'm on the floor, and another security guard saw me, and he sort of put his hand"
39:28;39:31;"on my shoulder, and he's like, ""You're getting out of here."""
39:31;39:35;"And I saw all the people around me, and I was like, ""Get your hands off of me, fat man."""
39:35;39:36;"You said that?"
39:36;39:37;"Yeah."
39:37;39:41;"And he picked me up, and Jazzy Jeff was thrown out of the arena."
39:41;39:42;"Oh, yeah."
39:42;39:43;"I mean, it was uncool."
39:43;39:47;"Like, I wasn't happy, but I was so in the moment."
39:47;39:52;"Like I said, I think about the scene, and it was just so ... It wasn't kind."
39:52;39:58;"It's funny, because at our show, I was thinking a lot about security guards at Fish shows,"
39:58;39:59;"because it's totally a thing."
39:59;40:01;"I mean, you're a security guard at a music venue."
40:01;40:05;"You're going to see all sorts of different people."
40:05;40:08;"Probably certain crowds, you're going to be like, ""Oh, boy."""
40:08;40:09;"I don't know."
40:09;40:12;"Certain artists, you're going to be like, ""That's going to be kind of aggressive."""
40:12;40:16;"But at a Fish show, it's probably one of the weirder ones, because you're only getting"
40:16;40:17;"them so often."
40:17;40:22;"You're not exactly getting some big, aggressive people, but you are going to get a lot of"
40:22;40:26;"kind of strange people doing very weird dances down the aisle."
40:26;40:30;"That's what I kept seeing, was the security guards always kind of looking kind of confused,"
40:30;40:34;"and then just seeing some dude just doing like R. Crumb funny walk down the aisle, just"
40:34;40:42;"like ... Just like some Jack Black joke dance, but some kooky, just like 46-year-old dude"
40:42;40:43;"on mushrooms."
40:43;40:45;"Just like, ""Badoop, badoop, badoop, badoop."""
40:45;40:47;"These people just being like, ""Come on."
40:47;40:48;"You stop."
40:48;40:49;"Move, move."""
40:49;40:53;"It never got too spicy, but they're probably just like, ""Oh, here comes another one."""
40:53;40:55;"Just like, ""Badoop, badoop, badoop, badoop, badoop."""
40:55;40:57;"Dudes who are just on Mars."
40:57;40:58;"Exactly."
40:58;40:59;"I mean, just in their own world."
40:59;41:00;"Right."
41:00;41:01;"They're not going to punch you in the face."
41:01;41:02;"No."
41:02;41:06;"It is just kind of like ... I saw a lot of security guard eye rolling, like, ""Let's keep"
41:06;41:07;"on moving."""
41:07;41:08;"Yeah."
41:08;41:09;"Then the people just looking at them with a big, crazy smile, like, ""Are you sure?"
41:09;41:10;"Are you sure I can't just keep dancing here?"
41:10;41:11;"Are you sure?"""
41:11;41:15;"I'm just like, ""Come on."""
41:15;41:17;"I also ... You'll talk about the show."
41:17;41:22;"Seeing them at the Bowl, which feels fairly like a mature and sophisticated environment."
41:22;41:24;"There's seating, but it's in amphitheater."
41:24;41:25;"It's outdoors."
41:25;41:30;"When I saw the dead at RFK Stadium, which was outside, and when I would go to the DMV"
41:30;41:35;"shows, which were, like I said, in ... There's something about also seeing them inside a"
41:35;41:37;"closed arena."
41:37;41:39;"The vibe felt like a boiling pot."
41:39;41:43;"Especially at the perimeter, and also we were very blessed to have excellent seats down"
41:43;41:47;"in one of the boxes of the Hollywood Bowl, so close to the stage."
41:47;41:52;"But you know, the Hollywood Bowl, there's another 15,000 people behind you."
41:52;41:55;"So yeah, the vibe could be totally different in other sections."
41:55;41:58;"Although you totally had people trying to come into the front."
41:58;42:00;"We actually ... Jake made some fronts."
42:00;42:01;"That's true."
42:01;42:02;"We had some encroachers."
42:02;42:07;"Because you're sitting in the box, there's the four folding chairs."
42:07;42:08;"Yeah."
42:08;42:11;"You're sitting there before the show starts, and you're drinking your red wine, you're"
42:11;42:14;"eating your cheese plate, your turkey club, whatever it is."
42:14;42:17;"And then the show starts and everyone stands."
42:17;42:20;"And then the folding chair is still just open behind you."
42:20;42:24;"And then at some point, maybe an hour into the show, this woman was like, ""Can I fold"
42:24;42:25;"your chair?"""
42:25;42:27;"And I was like, ""No, I'm good."""
42:27;42:29;"Because she was kind of in the aisle, right?"
42:29;42:30;"Like directly behind us."
42:30;42:34;"But she kind of wanted to get in our box so she wouldn't get cleared by security."
42:34;42:35;"Right."
42:35;42:36;"If you hang in the aisle, the security could get you."
42:36;42:37;"And she was there with her husband."
42:37;42:39;"And I was like, ""Okay, let's just roll with it."
42:39;42:40;"Let's fold the chair."""
42:40;42:45;"And then she and her husband were kind of like half in our box and half in the aisle"
42:45;42:46;"behind us."
42:46;42:48;"We just got a little backstory."
42:48;42:49;"I mean-"
42:49;42:50;"No, they were super cool."
42:50;42:51;"Been in millions of shows."
42:51;42:52;"Yeah, wait."
42:52;42:55;"Because this is how I remember the conversation."
42:55;42:57;"Because of course at a Fish Show, there's a lot of conversation about how many shows"
42:57;42:58;"have you been to."
42:58;43:01;"Like I talked to a guy, a friend of a friend."
43:01;43:02;"We were chatting."
43:02;43:04;"He came in the intermission."
43:04;43:05;"We chatted a bit."
43:05;43:06;"And he's like a big Jam Band fan."
43:06;43:08;"He's about to go see Goose up in SF."
43:08;43:11;"And so I was like, ""How many Fish Shows have you been to?"""
43:11;43:13;"And he was like, ""Oh man, a lot."
43:13;43:14;"Probably like 60."""
43:14;43:15;"That's deep."
43:16;43:18;"I've met people like that all the time."
43:18;43:22;"I think like CT has been like maybe like 30 or something."
43:22;43:26;"But my memory is that you're talking to this woman who's very kind vibe, probably a little"
43:26;43:27;"bit zonked."
43:27;43:29;"And this is how I remember the conversation going."
43:29;43:35;"Because sometimes when people are a little bit zonked, their face can be very bright,"
43:35;43:41;"playful, but also like these micro expressions of almost like fear, mystical fear."
43:41;43:42;"Or confusion."
43:42;43:43;"Confusion."
43:43;43:44;"Like deep confusion."
43:44;43:46;"So my memory is that Jay was like, ""Oh, big fan."
43:46;43:47;"How many shows have you been to?"""
43:47;43:49;"And then she just very seriously said, ""Millions."""
43:49;43:50;"Right?"
43:50;43:51;"Yeah, yeah."
43:51;43:54;"Her vibe was intense."
43:54;43:56;"And not even with like a laugh."
43:56;43:58;"Like, ""Oh man, millions."""
43:58;44:02;"Almost like so seriously like, ""Whoa, how'd you pull that one off?"
44:02;44:03;"Millions."""
44:03;44:09;"And then I think I volunteered that this was my first show since 1995, 28 years ago."
44:09;44:11;"And that garnered no response."
44:11;44:12;"I don't think she heard."
44:12;44:16;"I don't think she was in a position to monologue."
44:16;44:19;"She was not in a position to like converse."
44:19;44:21;"She wasn't interested in what I had to say."
44:21;44:22;"When that's fine."
44:22;44:24;"She was like on another planet."
44:24;44:26;"And then she started going into her history."
44:26;44:28;"She used to be a stripper."
44:28;44:33;"This guy came into the club, took her out of the club, took her to a further show 20"
44:33;44:34;"years ago."
44:34;44:37;"And then from there they went to some fish shows."
44:37;44:41;"And it's just been 20 years of just like cruising around with this dude who's her husband."
44:41;44:45;"She has three kids, 25, 19, and 14."
44:45;44:48;"The youngest one is like a honor roll."
44:48;44:52;"Yeah, I remember she was like, ""Can you believe it?"
44:52;44:54;"Me raising an honor roll student?"""
44:54;44:58;"I was like, ""We don't have a large base of information to like judge you."""
44:58;44:59;"Well, true."
44:59;45:00;"Yeah, it's like, ""Yeah, sure."""
45:00;45:01;"It's sort of surprising."
45:01;45:06;"But then I think if her story was like, ""I was stripping, then I was introduced to this"
45:06;45:07;"lifestyle."""
45:07;45:10;"Maybe she was just kind of like, ""Yeah, I just never would have thought that I'd have"
45:10;45:11;"like an honor roll kid."""
45:11;45:12;"It's sweet."
45:12;45:13;"Yeah."
45:13;45:17;"How did your '95 show, which was around the time I went compared to this show."
45:17;45:19;"I don't remember, man."
45:19;45:25;"I went at the Portland Memorial Coliseum, October of '95, my freshman year of college."
45:25;45:30;"Went with my mom's college friend, Martha, and her daughter, Sarah."
45:30;45:32;"Wait, you told us about this years ago."
45:32;45:34;"Yeah, maybe like four years older than me."
45:34;45:36;"And they were like heavy duty fish heads."
45:36;45:38;"Yes, because I was a big dead head at the time."
45:38;45:39;"Yeah."
45:39;45:40;"Lifelong."
45:40;45:41;"Yeah."
45:41;45:42;"And I said, ""Oh, okay."
45:42;45:43;"You guys are into fish."
45:43;45:44;"Cool."
45:44;45:45;"How do you feel about the dead?"""
45:45;45:46;"And they're like, ""We're not into it, man."""
45:46;45:47;"Really?"
45:47;45:48;"And Martha was like, ""The dead weren't political."
45:48;45:51;"The stones were political."
45:51;45:52;"The dead weren't political, man."""
45:52;45:54;"Is fish political?"
45:54;45:55;"Different era."
45:55;45:56;"I don't know."
45:56;46:00;"She was just like, ""The dead are boring and they weren't political."""
46:00;46:01;"And I was like, ""Okay."""
46:01;46:05;"Because I was like, ""I think the dead are the OGs and I think they're the best."""
46:05;46:06;"This is in 19..."
46:06;46:10;"I basically am the same person I was 28 years ago."
46:10;46:11;"And so I went..."
46:11;46:16;"And I was like, you know, a little more uptight, just sort of like into like matador bands"
46:16;46:17;"and punk and stuff."
46:17;46:21;"I rolled to the show and like they were like fully in..."
46:21;46:23;"They're full reverie."
46:23;46:24;"They're on Mars."
46:24;46:27;"They were smoking weed, which I was not."
46:27;46:30;"I was stone cold sober, probably drinking like a Dr. Pepper."
46:30;46:31;"Interesting."
46:31;46:35;"Full like tie-dyed dresses and just like doing the twirling."
46:35;46:38;"And I was just kind of standing there next to them, arms crossed."
46:38;46:39;"Did you know any fish songs?"
46:39;46:42;"Did you ever throw it on an album?"
46:42;46:43;"Yes, I did."
46:43;46:48;"Because my freshman year roommate, this guy, Nat Keefe, big fish head."
46:48;46:51;"And he would listen to tapes from the late 80s and be like, ""Dude, what they were doing"
46:51;46:52;"then was so raw."""
46:53;46:57;"He would also listen to this tape from like '89 or '90, like, ""This is so raw."
46:57;46:58;"What they're doing now, I don't know."""
46:58;47:01;"Like he was already like, ""I'm done."""
47:01;47:02;"In '95."
47:03;47:05;"And so I was..."
47:05;47:06;"Yeah, always somebody."
47:06;47:07;"Exactly."
47:07;47:09;"I was familiar, enjoyed the show."
47:09;47:10;"The only thing I really remember..."
47:10;47:12;"No, actually, I didn't enjoy the show."
47:12;47:15;"It was one of those shows that starts and I was like, ""When is this going to be over?"""
47:15;47:20;"And the only thing I remember was they played ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" as an encore."
47:20;47:22;"Wasn't a fan then."
47:22;47:26;"And then 28 years later, saw him again with the crew, Hollywood Bowl."
47:26;47:27;"Great show."
47:27;47:28;"Great vibes."
47:28;47:29;"It seemed like you were having a great time."
47:29;47:30;"I had a great time."
47:30;47:31;"It was a great show and the energy was great."
47:31;47:34;"And we went with a good buddy, Brian."
47:34;47:42;"But also we brought Seinfeld, who I think has far away the least experience with fish."
47:42;47:43;"Zero."
47:43;47:44;"Right."
47:44;47:45;"Like, did you know a single song?"
47:45;47:46;"No."
47:46;47:47;"No, no, no, no."
47:47;47:49;"I've been like kind of avoiding them my whole life."
47:49;47:52;"And I was saying to you guys that I had a very different..."
47:52;47:55;"I just had a preconception of what their music sounded like."
47:55;47:58;"And it was not very close to what I heard."
47:58;48:03;"But no, I mean, I'd probably going in, I probably heard like less than five minutes of their"
48:03;48:04;"music."
48:04;48:05;"Like I was like a fish virgin."
48:05;48:06;"You can be honest."
48:06;48:08;"I mean, we were there for like four hours."
48:08;48:10;"Yeah, about four hours."
48:10;48:13;"And I mean, they played for probably, you know, over three."
48:13;48:15;"We were there from 630 to 1030."
48:15;48:16;"Almost exactly."
48:16;48:19;"And they played from like seven to like 1015."
48:19;48:22;"So regardless of what you thought about the music, were you bored?"
48:22;48:24;"No, I had a good time."
48:24;48:25;"Were you ever bored?"
48:25;48:26;"It was a little cold."
48:27;48:28;"A little cold."
48:28;48:29;"I got a little cold at the end."
48:29;48:30;"And then that..."
48:30;48:31;"So it was maybe a little uncomfortable at the end."
48:31;48:32;"But no, I was bored because I was like very stimulated because I was taking it all in."
48:32;48:33;"And I was kind of like..."
48:33;48:34;"And then..."
48:34;48:38;"Even with the longer jams, you were like, okay, watching everybody, taking it all in."
48:38;48:41;"Well, yeah, this is the other thing about the longer jams is that to me, because I was"
48:41;48:45;"kind of asking you guys too, like, how much jamming are they actually doing?"
48:45;48:49;"Because they're so virtuosic and the playing is so precise, which was a big surprise to"
48:49;48:55;"me that I kind of almost didn't feel like they were jamming in the way that I imagined"
48:55;48:56;"they would be."
48:56;49:02;"Like I was picturing a lot of like noodling and wailing and sludgy kind of solo-y kind"
49:02;49:03;"of sloppy."
49:03;49:07;"Not sloppy, but like hippie kind of stoned out vibes."
49:07;49:08;"No, it's like very tight."
49:08;49:09;"It's like the energy is building."
49:09;49:12;"Yeah, that was the biggest surprise to me."
49:12;49:18;"It was so tight that it didn't even feel traditionally jammy in the way that I kind of imagined."
49:18;49:21;"Yeah, not like stoner, just like aimless."
49:21;49:24;"Slow paced and kind of, yeah, like dissonant or something."
49:24;49:26;"It was very polished."
49:26;49:28;"And we were treated to a great set list."
49:28;49:29;"Birds of a Feather opener."
49:29;49:38;"It's like a vampire, that start."
49:38;49:39;"Is this studio recording or is this..."
49:39;49:41;"This is a studio recording."
49:41;49:42;"What year is this?"
49:42;49:43;"This is like late 90s."
49:43;49:44;"Story of the Ghost was this like '98."
49:44;49:45;"This is when they were getting like a little funkier."
49:45;50:02;"This is just like off to the races, everybody having a great time."
50:02;50:03;"After that got into Rogue."
50:03;50:11;"But I felt like where it really started to come together for the crew was this next song,"
50:11;50:13;"Divided Sky."
50:13;50:17;"So this is the studio version."
50:17;50:24;"I was looking it up."
50:24;50:27;"They first played it live in 1987."
50:27;50:31;"It came out on the album Junta in 1989."
50:31;50:34;"It's like a very classic Fish."
50:34;50:37;"They play it every tour, every few shows."
50:37;50:41;"But it's essentially like a suite, like a yes or something."
50:41;50:44;"It's mostly instrumental."
50:44;50:48;"Whenever this was, like four or five years ago, I started more earnestly listening to"
50:48;50:49;"Fish."
50:49;50:56;"This is like one of the songs that really I found interesting."
50:56;51:09;"This is almost like Zeppelin or something."
51:09;51:10;"Yeah, totally."
51:10;51:28;"This is the early era, which will come into play later."
51:28;51:39;"So this is off their first record?"
51:39;51:40;"Yeah."
51:40;51:41;"Soon to their first record?"
51:41;51:42;"Yeah."
51:42;51:44;"There is something raw about this."
51:44;51:45;"Your roommate's right."
51:45;51:53;"There's also something about this being in the 80s that I also find so interesting."
51:53;52:03;"Yeah, I mean, there weren't as many bands in the 80s, like really going back to the"
52:03;52:04;"70s."
52:04;52:16;"And just like so unaffected, just like pure instruments, just kind of ripping."
52:16;52:18;"It doesn't sound 80s, like the production."
52:18;52:19;"No."
52:19;52:23;"Like if you just played this, I'd be like, ""I don't know what this is."""
52:23;52:26;"Did you notice a lot of young people in the crowd?"
52:26;52:28;"No, not in the expensive seats."
52:28;52:30;"Yeah, we had the industry hookup."
52:30;52:31;"Yeah, we had the industry hookup."
52:31;52:33;"I'm just wondering how they-"
52:33;52:35;"There could have been plenty in the back."
52:35;52:37;"Yeah, just how they aged in that way."
52:37;52:41;"When I was thinking about my story about this, I think it was one of the first times I went"
52:41;52:46;"out with, and I definitely went with this kid, Jordan Bromley, who was a big fish head."
52:46;52:51;"But it was one of the first shows I ever went to, which I think, I don't know who the band"
52:51;52:55;"would have been for you, but in high school where the express purpose kind of was to get"
52:55;52:57;"f***ed up at the show."
52:57;53:00;"See, I didn't get f***ed up in high school."
53:00;53:03;"And I really, this was one of the reasons I acted out this way."
53:03;53:04;"I didn't either."
53:04;53:06;"And so I just remember going with a group of kids."
53:06;53:10;"Do you know where you're like, ""This is why we're going to the show."""
53:10;53:16;"But instead we had a heavy high school, college high school element at a mid-90s fish show,"
53:16;53:19;"not a ton of old heads."
53:19;53:26;"And so I'm just wondering if they still pull the Gen Z crowd?"
53:26;53:27;"It's hard to say."
53:27;53:32;"Where we were up front, I mean, those tickets probably on the secondary market could go"
53:32;53:33;"for crazy money."
53:33;53:40;"So you're definitely getting, if I had to describe the average person up front, I would"
53:40;53:48;"say a dude in their 40s or 50s, looks like they probably have a pretty lucrative straight"
53:48;53:53;"job during the week, throws on a fun t-shirt, maybe a little bit of a costume, has fun on"
53:53;53:58;"the weekend, probably back at the office wheeling and dealing next morning."
53:58;54:00;"That was kind of the energy of where we were."
54:00;54:04;"And then you had some of like the, like our friend we made, the millions of shows type"
54:04;54:11;"people making their way through more of your classic, just like on the road, hippie, wook"
54:11;54:12;"type person."
54:12;54:17;"I'm sure there are much younger people in the back partying and having the time of their"
54:17;54:18;"lives."
54:18;54:24;"Cause when you go to the, when you've been to recent dead shows, like dead and co shows,"
54:24;54:26;"does that feel like a young crowd?"
54:26;54:31;"The only dead and co show that we went to that are that I went to with Jake, I saw,"
54:31;54:33;"I felt like I saw, oh, this is the part."
54:33;54:34;"This is a beautiful moment."
54:34;54:35;"Yeah, this is great."
54:35;54:36;"Yeah."
54:36;54:39;"Dead and co walking around."
54:39;54:41;"I feel like I was seeing everybody."
54:41;54:44;"I was seeing young kids with their parents and stuff."
54:44;54:46;"Were they pulling more young people because of John Mayer?"
54:46;54:48;"I don't know."
54:48;54:52;"And then also you got to remember LA, you're probably getting such a specific slice of"
54:52;54:53;"the fish audience."
54:53;54:57;"Cause as we've talked about many times, Los Angeles, not jam country."
54:57;55:01;"It's got pockets, the second biggest city in America, but it's not jam country."
55:01;55:06;"I bet when you're going to see like them at a Dick's sporting goods in Colorado, I bet"
55:06;55:12;"you're getting full like three generation fish families, little kids, teenagers."
55:12;55:13;"I think you're getting everybody."
55:13;55:17;"LA, you're getting the studio executive."
55:17;55:19;"Didn't see any families at the show."
55:19;55:20;"No."
55:20;55:21;"Yeah."
55:21;55:23;"Older people, A-list Hollywood actors."
55:23;55:24;"When you saw, wasn't Paul Dano?"
55:24;55:25;"Yeah."
55:25;55:26;"Paul Dano."
55:26;55:27;"Rumored."
55:27;55:29;"I didn't see him, but he was rumored to be right in front of us or a few boxes up."
55:29;55:31;"I didn't actually see him."
55:31;55:32;"We heard he was there."
55:32;55:33;"Yeah."
55:33;55:35;"Oscar nominated actors."
55:35;55:37;"That's more who you're getting in out in Hollywood."
55:37;55:40;"I saw Aaron Paul was at the night before."
55:40;55:41;"Oh, he was?"
55:41;55:42;"Oh, interesting."
55:42;55:45;"I saw Aaron Paul from Breaking Bad, Jesse Beckman."
55:45;55:49;"I'm seeing the photo of Paul Dano front row."
55:49;55:52;"Noted fish fan, Paul Dano spotted at recent fish concert."
55:52;55:54;"They should do a Breaking Bad spinoff."
55:54;56:00;"That's about like a couple summers before the events of Breaking Bad."
56:00;56:06;"Jesse went on tour, followed fish on their summer tour selling meth in the lot."
56:06;56:08;"Like summer, like 2002."
56:08;56:11;"Yeah, exactly."
56:11;56:14;"Which is like right before the fish hiatus, which can make it even more poignant."
56:14;56:15;"Oh yeah."
56:15;56:17;"Fish went on hiatus."
56:17;56:20;"Jesse Pinkman was without purpose."
56:20;56:23;"He linked up with Mr. White."
56:23;56:24;"Why are you doing this, Jesse?"
56:24;56:25;"No, Mr. White, I'm not interested in fishing."
56:25;56:26;"Wait, what's his voice like?"
56:26;56:27;"It's like that."
56:27;56:28;"It's like maybe a little grittier."
56:28;56:29;"You know what I mean?"
56:29;56:30;"They all love me, Mr. White."
56:30;56:31;"This fish went on a hiatus."
56:31;56:32;"I'm just sitting here, beckoning out, but I'm bored out of my fucking skull, man."
56:32;56:33;"I'm bored out of my fucking skull."
56:37;56:41;"I'm bored out of my fucking skull."
56:41;56:42;"I'm bored out of my fucking skull."
57:21;57:24;"the big chemical company."
57:24;57:29;"He was probably going to see dead shows and then once he lost that job, became a high"
57:29;57:32;"school teacher and he was kind of mad at the world, he wasn't checking."
57:32;57:33;"No."
57:33;57:34;"For fish."
57:34;57:35;"Walter White was an old head."
57:35;57:36;"He was-"
57:36;57:37;"Fish virgin?"
57:37;57:38;"Oh, big time."
57:38;57:39;"Yeah."
57:39;57:40;"He never saw them."
57:40;57:41;"Fish saw."
57:41;57:42;"He died during the hiatus, so."
57:42;57:46;"Never got to see him."
57:46;57:56;"In Breaking Bad, what kind of music does- I mean, Jesse has that kind of just like-"
57:56;57:57;"Incubus kind of-"
57:57;58:00;"Yeah, he probably listens to like hip hop and metal kind of thing."
58:00;58:01;"System of a Down."
58:01;58:03;"But that same guy could totally be into fish."
58:03;58:04;"Oh, totally."
58:04;58:10;"If he was from the Northeast, he'd be listening to fish."
58:10;58:11;"He's giving Walter White tapes."
58:11;58:23;"Yeah, it'll start out as a prequel where he's on tour and then it'll just roll into"
58:23;58:27;"like an alternate version of Breaking Bad where there's just more fish playing in the"
58:27;58:28;"trailer."
58:28;58:32;"I looked up what music does Walter White listen to and there's an interview with the music"
58:32;58:35;"supervisor from Breaking Bad."
58:35;58:39;"We decided early on that Walt was not a ""music guy,"" although he may think he is."
58:39;58:43;"His curiosity about music ended after his high school years, which means he's stuck"
58:43;58:46;"in the '70s listening to Boz Skaggs or Steely Dan."
58:46;58:50;"I think he also probably would have listened to Yes."
58:50;58:51;"He loves the precision."
58:51;58:52;"Yeah."
58:52;58:53;"Loves the precision."
58:53;58:54;"The chemistry."
58:54;58:59;"Yeah, so he probably would actually like fish."
58:59;59:00;"He would have dug fish."
59:00;59:01;"He would have dug fish."
59:01;59:08;"He starts playing it for him and he gets in."
59:08;59:24;"We were talking about what do you think it felt like to be at Nectar's 1987 Burlington"
59:24;59:25;"and seeing them drop this for the first time."
59:25;59:28;"Like on a January night."
59:28;59:30;"It's winter '87."
59:30;59:31;"It's freezing out."
59:31;59:33;"It's like six degrees."
59:33;59:34;"You come in."
59:34;59:36;"Oh, you take the scarf off."
59:36;59:37;"You hang the coat up."
59:37;59:41;"Hey, can I get a pint of Guinness and a whiskey back?"
59:41;59:43;"And they just rip into this."
59:43;59:45;"And then there's four guys in the corner."
59:45;59:46;"And meanwhile, like what?"
59:46;59:47;"And you're like, ""Damn, this is relentless."""
59:47;59:51;"1987."
59:51;59:55;"Smooth criminals on MTV nonstop."
59:55;59:57;"Madonna's huge."
59:57;01:00:00;"You just watched Beverly Hills Cop 2."
01:00:00;01:00:02;"And you come in and see this and you're like, ""Okay."""
01:00:02;01:00:04;"Kind of like a Zappa Yes thing."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"Okay, that's cool."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"That's cool."
01:00:06;01:00:20;"I guess I liked the live version more."
01:00:20;01:00:22;"Yeah, I probably should have played a live version."
01:00:22;01:00:23;"It's all good."
01:00:23;01:00:28;"I mean, I'm actually always curious to hear the studio recordings of jam bands."
01:00:28;01:00:32;"People crap on the dead studio albums, but I'm in."
01:00:32;01:00:35;"And a lot of people say Phish's best studio album is Billy Breathes."
01:00:35;01:00:41;"And actually, I love this song that they played at our show, Taste."
01:00:41;01:00:43;"This also sounds very different because Trey was playing it on an electric guitar."
01:00:43;01:00:44;"Do you remember this?"
01:00:44;01:01:14;"It's still very simple, but just maybe a tiny bit more vibe in the recording."
01:01:14;01:01:31;"Yeah, this is more produced for sure."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"I wonder where they recorded that first record."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"Was it just in a Burlington studio?"
01:01:35;01:01:36;"Yeah, probably."
01:01:36;01:01:38;"That's tight."
01:01:38;01:01:43;"It seemed like a major moment for all of us was, and I don't think any of us expected"
01:01:43;01:01:49;"it, but they just ripped into an excellent, very faithful cover in set two of Zeppelin"
01:01:49;01:01:50;"No Quarter."
01:01:50;01:01:52;"Is this it?"
01:01:52;01:01:57;"No, this is one of the earlier times they did it in 2012."
01:01:57;01:02:01;"I think I looked it up and they've only done No Quarter like 17 times, which for Phish"
01:02:01;01:02:02;"is nothing."
01:02:02;01:02:03;"Yeah, so we caught a-"
01:02:03;01:02:05;"We were very blessed to catch-"
01:02:05;01:02:06;"A rare gem."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"Yeah, to catch a No Quarter."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"And Paige always sings it?"
01:02:09;01:02:10;"I think so."
01:02:11;01:02:16;"Yeah, and Jake, so you decided Paige is your favorite member of the organization?"
01:02:16;01:02:17;"Yeah."
01:02:17;01:02:18;"I like his look."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"Yep."
01:02:19;01:02:23;"Cool, like biology teacher with a Hawaiian shirt on."
01:02:23;01:02:27;"I love that he was putting down musically, not flashy, but when you really listen to"
01:02:27;01:02:33;"him in relation to what Trey was doing, it was like, ""Okay, he's essential."""
01:02:33;01:02:34;"Very integral."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"Yeah."
01:02:35;01:02:36;"His voice didn't match his look at all."
01:02:36;01:02:37;"It was very pristine."
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Yeah."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"And he was like, he did look like-"
01:02:39;01:02:40;"He thought he just might be busting like a, ""Who da-da?"""
01:02:40;01:02:41;"That's how he looked."
01:02:41;01:02:42;"""Who da-da?"""
01:02:42;01:02:43;"Arguably the best singer."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"Yeah."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"Well, you know what?"
01:02:45;01:02:50;"Sometimes the person who sings backup has to be the best singer."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"Yeah, that nice high tenor."
01:02:52;01:02:57;"Yeah, because they're singing higher than the lead and Trey's got his idiosyncratic"
01:02:57;01:03:01;"voice, but yeah, Paige can just sing these beautiful harmonies."
01:03:01;01:03:04;"Was anyone in the group a huge Phish head?"
01:03:04;01:03:05;"Was Brian?"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"Brian, who we went with?"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"He definitely had seen the most shows in the 90s."
01:03:09;01:03:13;"He was telling me on the drive over, he'd seen like eight or nine shows in the 90s."
01:03:13;01:03:18;"Was there a moment where anyone was like, because sometimes it takes the energy of a"
01:03:18;01:03:25;"really excited fan to keep it going and was in this group, did anyone say, ""Let's, we"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"could get up before traffic's bad?"""
01:03:27;01:03:28;"No, that didn't come up."
01:03:28;01:03:38;"""Close the door, put out the light."""
01:03:38;01:03:44;"This is exactly how it sounded."
01:03:44;01:03:47;"""No, they won't be home tonight."""
01:03:47;01:03:49;"I've got some chills at this moment."
01:03:49;01:03:50;"Yeah, it's cool."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"""The snow falls hard and don't you know."""
01:03:51;01:03:58;"So sick."
01:03:58;01:04:07;"""The winds of fall are blowing cold."""
01:04:07;01:04:13;"And also this is like, you know, during an outdoor Phish show, because they hit it like"
01:04:13;01:04:16;"seven, you know, still basically broad daylight."
01:04:16;01:04:18;"First set, the sun's going down."
01:04:18;01:04:22;"And this is like set two, fully nighttime, kind of cold."
01:04:22;01:04:25;"And just like, ""Dah, nah, nah, nah."""
01:04:25;01:04:28;"""Hollywood Bowl, cold breeze blowing in."""
01:04:28;01:04:29;"Yeah."
01:04:29;01:04:30;"""Bring layers, folks."""
01:04:30;01:04:33;"Anyway, you get the idea."
01:04:33;01:04:34;"Great show."
01:04:34;01:04:37;"And actually, Matt, is CT ready?"
01:04:37;01:04:38;"I was just texting him."
01:04:38;01:04:39;"We can try him now."
01:04:39;01:04:44;"""Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."""
01:04:44;01:04:47;"What up?"
01:04:47;01:04:48;"Oh."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"How's it going?"
01:04:49;01:04:50;"What's up, guys?"
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Hey."
01:04:51;01:04:52;"That's funny."
01:04:52;01:04:53;"We got you on a big TV in here."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"I'm seeing a weird side to you."
01:04:55;01:04:57;"Yeah, this is a little bit different on here."
01:04:57;01:04:58;"What's up?"
01:04:58;01:04:59;"Welcome back to Time Crisis."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"Pleasure to be here."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"Pleasure to be back."
01:05:01;01:05:04;"I feel like I get called in once every six years to talk Phish."
01:05:04;01:05:07;"Wait, was it really that long ago?"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"It was a pretty long time ago."
01:05:09;01:05:12;"I feel like I called in as the East Coast correspondent for the Baker's Dozen."
01:05:12;01:05:13;"Oh, right."
01:05:13;01:05:14;"Whoa."
01:05:14;01:05:16;"When was that?"
01:05:16;01:05:20;"That was, oh, if I'm not mistaken, 2017."
01:05:20;01:05:21;"Wow."
01:05:21;01:05:26;"Yeah, my vaguely remember, Jake was fairly anti-Phish at the time."
01:05:26;01:05:28;"I certainly hope that's changed."
01:05:28;01:05:29;"Did I voice that?"
01:05:29;01:05:30;"I think a little bit."
01:05:30;01:05:31;"Okay."
01:05:31;01:05:34;"And I kind of remember being like only like wanting to know more."
01:05:34;01:05:36;"I've listened to quite a bit since then."
01:05:36;01:05:38;"I think that was kind of like my entry point."
01:05:38;01:05:44;"Well, I think the sheer scale of that event now eclipsed, of course, by Mr."
01:05:44;01:05:47;"Stiles in terms of consecutive MSGs."
01:05:47;01:05:51;"But at the time, it was kind of, I think, a fairly groundbreaking idea,"
01:05:51;01:05:52;"especially with that size."
01:05:52;01:05:55;"And yet, it was just more of an event that I think Phish had, it sort of"
01:05:55;01:05:58;"bubbled up from just their own world in a lot of ways."
01:05:58;01:06:00;"Yeah, 13 shows in a row."
01:06:00;01:06:01;"Actually, it's funny."
01:06:01;01:06:05;"We've been talking about the Phish hiatus because actually I was talking to a"
01:06:05;01:06:11;"dude at the show who had gone to all three nights of the Hollywood Bowl,"
01:06:11;01:06:16;"huge Jam Band fan, and he said something to me along – he was like roughly"
01:06:16;01:06:19;"our age, and he said something to me along the lines of like, ""I missed out"
01:06:19;01:06:24;"on so much because kind of right when I was so ready for it in like my early"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"20s, Phish went on hiatus."""
01:06:26;01:06:27;"And I can't remember exactly what he said."
01:06:27;01:06:30;"He might have said something kind of funny like, ""Who knows?"
01:06:30;01:06:33;"Probably saved my life,"" or something like that."
01:06:33;01:06:37;"And I hadn't really thought about it because I wasn't really thinking too much"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"about Phish at the time."
01:06:39;01:06:43;"But it made me think about you, Chris, because you were such a big fan."
01:06:43;01:06:45;"Was that like a crazy drought?"
01:06:45;01:06:46;"What were you thinking?"
01:06:46;01:06:47;"I guess you were in college."
01:06:47;01:06:49;"Maybe you had other stuff on your mind."
01:06:49;01:06:53;"Well, okay, I think to get into my personal Phish history, I actually think –"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"so there have been two hiatuses."
01:06:55;01:06:58;"I don't know what the plural of that word is actually."
01:06:58;01:07:06;"The first one was 2000 to like New Year's Eve 2002 into 2003."
01:07:06;01:07:12;"And I, you know, thank whatever your higher power is, got to see one show"
01:07:12;01:07:15;"of what they call 1.0 in the fall of 2000."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"Great show, really."
01:07:17;01:07:20;"And I think that really kind of like I was into it, saw the show,"
01:07:20;01:07:23;"had my mind blown, and kind of really just dove into this history"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"and this whole universe."
01:07:25;01:07:30;"And then that was the tour that led – at the end of that tour was their"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"first hiatus."
01:07:31;01:07:36;"And I actually think that that lack of supply really increased my demand."
01:07:36;01:07:40;"It sort of made it more desirable, more interesting, and even kind of like"
01:07:40;01:07:43;"at that point thinking like, well, they're never playing again."
01:07:43;01:07:47;"And I saw this one show, but oh my God, I missed all of this history,"
01:07:47;01:07:51;"all of this whatever, the secret language in the early '90s,"
01:07:51;01:07:55;"the different eras of how the live show sounded, the albums corresponded."
01:07:55;01:08:00;"I think like not having new stuff going on then really allowed me to go back"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"into the history and just fall so, so –"
01:08:02;01:08:03;"Just get deep."
01:08:03;01:08:04;"Deeply, yeah."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"Listen to tapes."
01:08:05;01:08:10;"And again, in some ways not having to keep up with current tours"
01:08:10;01:08:16;"at that point kind of let it sink real deep kind of and really like just find"
01:08:16;01:08:19;"all the minutia and the old tapes and et cetera, et cetera."
01:08:19;01:08:23;"And then actually the first hiatus ended our freshman year."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"Okay."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"The first show I think was like SNL."
01:08:26;01:08:30;"They played two songs and I definitely waited in like the overnight Friday"
01:08:30;01:08:33;"night line to try to sneak in there."
01:08:33;01:08:34;"It didn't work out for me."
01:08:34;01:08:38;"But I did see New Year's 2002, went to a bunch of shows and that's 2.0,"
01:08:38;01:08:43;"what they call, and then the second hiatus, yeah, was like the '04 to '08, '09."
01:08:43;01:08:45;"Okay. So that's like the bigger one."
01:08:45;01:08:49;"Yeah. And then in a funny way for me in my personal musical life,"
01:08:49;01:08:54;"I saw as much as possible those couple years, saw the two festivals"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"that happened in those two years, IT and Coventry."
01:08:56;01:09:00;"Coventry was the last sort of the last hurrah at that time,"
01:09:00;01:09:01;"the second last hurrah."
01:09:01;01:09:06;"And then, you know, a little band called Vampire Weekend started two years later,"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"which was, you know, not--"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"Then you went full Andy."
01:09:10;01:09:16;"I mean, it's funny because like I feel very hard to exactly remember,"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"but I feel confident this is a true statement."
01:09:18;01:09:21;"I don't think I'd ever--I didn't know what Pitchfork was,"
01:09:21;01:09:26;"nor had I ever visited the website until after I was in Vampire Weekend."
01:09:26;01:09:30;"That seems right because you were like the least interested"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"in what people would now call indie music at the time."
01:09:33;01:09:38;"I also like--didn't you like famously buy the first Interpol album on CD?"
01:09:38;01:09:39;"I went to--"
01:09:39;01:09:42;"Like in 2011, you were like--because you were like,"
01:09:42;01:09:45;"""I want to see what these guys are all about."""
01:09:45;01:09:49;"I feel like it was either--like when we were doing the heavy band touring"
01:09:49;01:09:54;"in like Fall '07 into '08, you know, when we were like--"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"You know, in my mind, I was like, ""Damn, we're really doing this."""
01:09:56;01:10:01;"Yeah, I went through this run of like the first Interpol album,"
01:10:01;01:10:04;"first Arcade Fire album, The Strokes, quite frankly."
01:10:04;01:10:07;"I'd just be like, ""These albums are pretty good, guys."""
01:10:07;01:10:10;"And I think all three of you were like, ""Yeah, no [expletive] dude."""
01:10:10;01:10:12;"Even The Strokes, you didn't really know--"
01:10:12;01:10:13;"You knew who they were, just not really."
01:10:13;01:10:17;"I knew who they were, heard the couple radio songs,"
01:10:17;01:10:20;"but I had not listened to the records, like the full albums."
01:10:20;01:10:23;"Because at that point, I feel like to me in high school,"
01:10:23;01:10:24;"that felt like a dichotomy."
01:10:24;01:10:27;"I could be a Phish guy or a Strokes guy,"
01:10:27;01:10:30;"and I did not feel like--I didn't own a leather jacket."
01:10:30;01:10:33;"I don't know, like whatever my sensibility was,"
01:10:33;01:10:37;"it kind of felt like Phish was home and that's where I went."
01:10:37;01:10:40;"And only later on, sort of as I found myself--"
01:10:40;01:10:41;"This is not my beautiful house."
01:10:41;01:10:45;"As I found myself in big indie, you know, I had to educate myself."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"Do the homework."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"I mean, and quite frankly, it was a little bit late."
01:10:49;01:10:52;"Maybe ultimately for me personally, it was saving grace,"
01:10:52;01:10:55;"because I didn't know what I was doing,"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"much like I didn't know how to play drums at that time."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"Definitely, yeah."
01:10:59;01:11:02;"It was sort of like maybe a different perspective in the mix"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"that was maybe for the best."
01:11:04;01:11:08;"Well, I think especially because at the time,"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"all those bands and records that you listed,"
01:11:10;01:11:13;"even though they're considered indie classics,"
01:11:13;01:11:17;"when we were starting out, so much of it was about avoiding those bands."
01:11:17;01:11:20;"It's great that you as the drummer were unaware of that"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"and having other ideas."
01:11:59;01:12:01;"So Phish came back in '09."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"I believe so."
01:12:03;01:12:06;"Okay, all right. And then they've been touring consistently ever since."
01:12:06;01:12:07;"And now this--"
01:12:07;01:12:09;"And sort of one of the running jokes is like,"
01:12:09;01:12:13;"this is now 3.0, but now, depending on musical style"
01:12:13;01:12:16;"and people saying, ""Are we in 4.0?"""
01:12:16;01:12:18;"Right. It's about time to call it 4.0."
01:12:18;01:12:21;"Probably. It seems-- You know what? Maybe even this tour."
01:12:21;01:12:25;"Because this tour has been, at least the way I perceive it,"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"has been received super, super well."
01:12:27;01:12:29;"Yeah, what's the word in the community?"
01:12:29;01:12:32;"I'm not as deep as a lot of people."
01:12:32;01:12:35;"I mean, I'm fluent in the language, and I have my connection points,"
01:12:35;01:12:39;"but I would hesitate to speak for the Phish community at large."
01:12:39;01:12:42;"But the way I-- The sources I've seen,"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"they were all jacked up."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"Whether it's a really long--"
01:12:46;01:12:49;"Like, they did a 44-minute tweezer."
01:12:49;01:12:52;"Technically, in Berkeley,"
01:12:52;01:12:56;"technically, Alex from Real Estate and Taper's Choice"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"was at the Berkeley shows, and he was saying,"
01:12:58;01:13:01;"""Technically, the song after was a new song,"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"but it was kind of an extension of the tweezer,"
01:13:03;01:13:06;"so if you want to count that, they went over an hour."""
01:13:06;01:13:08;"Over a long tweezer."
01:13:08;01:13:10;"And I thought the Hollywood Bowl shows were great."
01:13:10;01:13:13;"I saw the first two. I didn't see the one you were at."
01:13:13;01:13:15;"It's perfect that between us-- We've covered it all."
01:13:15;01:13:17;"We've covered it all."
01:13:17;01:13:19;"We're the go-to source for all three nights."
01:13:19;01:13:21;"So, wait. I actually got a question for you."
01:13:21;01:13:24;"So, first night, you went with some of the Taper's Choice guys?"
01:13:24;01:13:27;"I went with Alex and some of his friends."
01:13:27;01:13:29;"And then, is this true, or through the grapevine,"
01:13:29;01:13:32;"night two, you went solo?"
01:13:32;01:13:37;"Yes, because I had the same group of friends were there,"
01:13:37;01:13:40;"but I have two young children,"
01:13:40;01:13:43;"and I had to work some expensive marital capital"
01:13:43;01:13:45;"into going into the second night as well."
01:13:45;01:13:49;"The deal of which being I could go after I put the kids to bed."
01:13:49;01:13:52;"I got a ticket late, and I was like, ""I really need to go."""
01:13:52;01:13:54;"5 p.m. bedtime."
01:13:54;01:13:57;"I pushed it up to a little bit earlier than normal."
01:13:57;01:14:00;"That is pretty high stakes, because you never know."
01:14:00;01:14:02;"""Oh, it's going to go down easy tonight,"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"or maybe just one more story."""
01:14:04;01:14:06;"You're just like, ""Ugh!"""
01:14:06;01:14:08;"You know how it is."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"The rule wasn't-- She didn't have to be asleep, obviously."
01:14:10;01:14:13;"The door just had to be closed, and the functions fulfilled."
01:14:13;01:14:16;"So, I missed a couple songs, if I'm being honest."
01:14:16;01:14:20;"I missed the first couple songs of night two, but saw most of it."
01:14:20;01:14:23;"You put in this last-minute request to get one ticket."
01:14:23;01:14:25;"One ticket, yes."
01:14:25;01:14:29;"At the show, people go say hi to each other at the break and stuff,"
01:14:29;01:14:33;"but most of the show, you were just in that solo seat?"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"I was in-- You know how they have boxes?"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"I was in a box at the back of the boxes,"
01:14:37;01:14:40;"although a very good spot, because I was next to Corotta,"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"who was their lighting designer."
01:14:42;01:14:44;"I was able to watch."
01:14:44;01:14:49;"Famously, he's like-- CK5 is his nickname."
01:14:49;01:14:52;"He's the fifth member of the band, because he's jamming with them."
01:14:52;01:14:55;"He's got cues, but he's reacting in real time."
01:14:55;01:14:57;"He doesn't know the songs they're going to play."
01:14:57;01:15:00;"It was very cool to see him."
01:15:00;01:15:02;"Even a couple moments where he was laughing"
01:15:02;01:15:07;"with the front-of-house guy, the sound guy next to him,"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"and he was doing lighting cues like no luck."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"He was looking at the front-of-house guy"
01:15:11;01:15:15;"and still doing cool lighting stuff without looking at the board."
01:15:15;01:15:16;"Dialed in."
01:15:16;01:15:19;"I went solo. I was in a box with three people I didn't know."
01:15:19;01:15:21;"Had a couple good exchanges, but for the most part--"
01:15:21;01:15:24;"I feel like at a Fizz show, people introduce themselves"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"more than at other shows, right?"
01:15:26;01:15:29;"Yeah, because it feels--"
01:15:29;01:15:32;"As big as it is, Three Nights in the Hollywood Bowl is pretty big."
01:15:32;01:15:36;"It still feels pretty handmade and pretty community-focused."
01:15:36;01:15:39;"Not for everybody, maybe, but I think largely it's like--"
01:15:39;01:15:42;"One of my favorite parts of night one was getting out of the car"
01:15:42;01:15:47;"and walking in that pedestrian underpass of Highland"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"or whatever street that is."
01:15:49;01:15:53;"The tension's building-- Not tension, the excitement's building."
01:15:53;01:15:55;"People are screaming."
01:15:55;01:15:58;"For better or worse, people are doing a lot of nitrous balloons."
01:15:58;01:16:00;"The crowd is crescendoing as you're getting closer to the door"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"and everyone's getting pumped."
01:16:02;01:16:05;"It's still-- Inside and outside, it still feels like"
01:16:05;01:16:10;"this very unique community, which I don't get to interface with often."
01:16:10;01:16:13;"I had forgotten how cool it is to walk into a Fizz show"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"and feel it build."
01:16:15;01:16:18;"Definitely one of the most stoked audiences I've ever seen."
01:16:18;01:16:21;"Oh, yeah. Very happy people."
01:16:21;01:16:24;"As soon as-- First note of the first song, just like--"
01:16:24;01:16:27;"People dancing like wild. No need to--"
01:16:27;01:16:30;"There were a lot of multi-night attendees."
01:16:30;01:16:32;"Oh, I bet. I think a lot."
01:16:32;01:16:35;"I know a couple-- It seemed like a couple people won."
01:16:35;01:16:38;"One guy flew in-- People fly in for the weekend."
01:16:38;01:16:41;"It helps it's a long weekend, or over a weekend."
01:16:41;01:16:44;"This is really just off the top of my head. I don't know anything."
01:16:44;01:16:47;"I would guess a third of the people saw all three."
01:16:47;01:16:49;"That's deep. Which at the Ollie Bowl--"
01:16:49;01:16:51;"If not more. --6,000 people."
01:16:51;01:16:53;"Yeah. No, I could totally believe that."
01:16:53;01:16:58;"Yeah. If you're a super big fan, absolutely."
01:16:58;01:17:00;"Are you sad you missed a third night?"
01:17:00;01:17:05;"You know, my parents were in town, and we skipped town on that Sunday,"
01:17:05;01:17:08;"so it was kind of impossible, but I did--"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"I was seeing the set list come in,"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"and I was kind of getting legitimately pissed off,"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"because they were all good songs."
01:17:14;01:17:17;"And I was just like, ""Oh, [bleep] damn it. I should have gone."""
01:17:17;01:17:19;"But you know, it passes."
01:17:19;01:17:22;"But I was kind of bummed, definitely, as it was happening."
01:17:22;01:17:25;"Especially getting texts from my guys who were there."
01:17:25;01:17:27;"""No quarter, dude! No quarter!"""
01:17:27;01:17:29;"Exactly. Multiple automation points."
01:17:29;01:17:30;"That was very exciting."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"What were the highlights of the first two nights for you?"
01:17:32;01:17:35;"Well, any time you get a ""You Enjoy Myself,"""
01:17:35;01:17:37;"which is kind of their signature tune,"
01:17:37;01:17:39;"that's always-- for me, that's always a win."
01:17:39;01:17:42;"Although I had this new-- this thought I never had before is,"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"you know, I don't know exactly how old they are,"
01:17:44;01:17:47;"but they're probably around 60, 60-ish."
01:17:47;01:17:48;"Yeah. Looked it up."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"Yeah."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"Either 60 or about to turn 60."
01:17:51;01:17:54;"There's this bit in ""You Enjoy Myself"""
01:17:54;01:17:58;"where it's kind of like a keyboard solo bass breakdown,"
01:17:58;01:18:01;"and Trey and Mike jump on trampolines."
01:18:01;01:18:02;"Right."
01:18:02;01:18:05;"And they have this coordinated turn dance thing."
01:18:05;01:18:08;"And for some reason, being kind of close and seeing them,"
01:18:08;01:18:11;"and, you know, they look good, but they're definitely 60."
01:18:11;01:18:14;"And just kind of like, ""Damn, that's got to be tough on those knees"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"to have to bust out those trampolines every time."""
01:18:16;01:18:17;"""Let's be careful, guys."""
01:18:17;01:18:20;"They used to have a thing on a song called ""It's Ice"""
01:18:20;01:18:23;"where they-- remember this old exercise thing that was like skating?"
01:18:23;01:18:26;"Where they would bring out a full-size ice rink"
01:18:26;01:18:29;"with 80 hockey players and Olympic athletes?"
01:18:29;01:18:31;"Only college hockey players."
01:18:31;01:18:33;"You know, remember it was like an exercise thing in the '90s or whatever"
01:18:33;01:18:37;"where you'd put on like booties and slide back and forth?"
01:18:37;01:18:39;"Yeah, on a slippery piece of rubber."
01:18:39;01:18:40;"On a slippery-- yeah, whatever it was."
01:18:40;01:18:41;"Rubbery plastic. Yeah, yeah."
01:18:41;01:18:44;"They did that, I believe, on a song called ""It's Ice."""
01:18:44;01:18:45;"Get it?"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"But anyways, ""You Enjoy Myself"" was the highlight."
01:18:47;01:18:50;"The jam in ""Down With Disease"" I thought was very good"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"on the first night."
01:18:52;01:18:54;"Oh, yeah. ""Down With Disease"" is a great song."
01:18:54;01:18:58;"And then the second night, I got there at Harry Hood."
01:18:58;01:19:01;"But the whole second set-- honestly, the whole show I thought was really great."
01:19:01;01:19:07;"And even visually, Trey was kind of doing this almost punky--"
01:19:07;01:19:12;"towards the end of the second set-- guitar stabs."
01:19:12;01:19:16;"And visually, this kind of rock star [bleep]"
01:19:16;01:19:20;"where he walked in front of his mic and was almost--"
01:19:20;01:19:23;"didn't quite have his foot on the speakers,"
01:19:23;01:19:25;"you know, the wedges up front."
01:19:25;01:19:27;"Like, I don't know, whatever, AC/DC or something."
01:19:27;01:19:30;"But he was almost doing that in a way that doesn't seem normal for him."
01:19:30;01:19:31;"He was really feeling it."
01:19:31;01:19:32;"I mean, the whole show was great."
01:19:32;01:19:36;"The Chalk Dusts-- I think the Chalk Dusts was kind of the big opening."
01:19:36;01:19:38;"""Sneak and Sally Through the Alley"" is a good cover for them."
01:19:38;01:19:40;"They've been doing that for a long time."
01:19:40;01:19:41;"That's Robert Palmer?"
01:19:41;01:19:42;"Yep."
01:19:42;01:19:44;"I think I liked the second night a little bit better,"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"but both shows I thought were really great."
01:20:33;01:20:35;"Are they a zero banter band?"
01:20:35;01:20:38;"Because we got no banter night three."
01:20:38;01:20:39;"Very light."
01:20:39;01:20:42;"And actually, even as a sign that Trey was kind of feeling it,"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"he even said that--"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"he said, like, four sentences at one point."
01:20:46;01:20:48;"I forget exactly what he said, but it was like--"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"someone was like, ""Oh, he's getting chatty tonight."
01:20:50;01:20:51;"Nice."""
01:20:51;01:20:53;"Wait, was that always true?"
01:20:53;01:20:56;"I feel like in the '90s, was it more chatty?"
01:20:56;01:21:00;"Well, I think there was never, like, you know,"
01:21:00;01:21:01;"like, ""How y'all feeling?"""
01:21:01;01:21:03;"Never not, like, classic banter."
01:21:03;01:21:04;"But there was--"
01:21:04;01:21:07;"they had, like, this whole-- again, this whole mythology of"
01:21:07;01:21:11;"there would be songs where kind of the point of the song"
01:21:11;01:21:14;"was that Trey would do a narration."
01:21:14;01:21:17;"So he would, like, tell this, like, fanciful story"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"that involves the same characters."
01:21:19;01:21:21;"Presumably he made them up on the spot."
01:21:21;01:21:23;"Sometimes they, like, they led into, like,"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"a cover they were doing or whatever."
01:21:25;01:21:26;"So there was definitely a lot of--"
01:21:26;01:21:29;"there was more communication, if not always,"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"in the classic between-song banter."
01:21:31;01:21:33;"But it was, like, kind of rolled into the whole experience."
01:21:33;01:21:34;"Right."
01:21:34;01:21:37;"Okay, so, yeah, never too much banter."
01:21:37;01:21:40;"Yeah, I think R&I was just maybe very--"
01:21:40;01:21:41;"Drive safe."
01:21:41;01:21:43;"Very, just like, ""Oh, thanks for coming. Drive safe."""
01:21:43;01:21:47;"Chris, have you ever seen a show that was disappointing?"
01:21:47;01:21:49;"'Cause I feel like the-- everything is like,"
01:21:49;01:21:50;"""Yeah, man, it was amazing."""
01:21:50;01:21:52;"Like, the whole-- or, like, is the crap--"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"like, have you ever, like, checked in with the community"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"and they're just like, ""Wow, man, they're having a rough week."
01:21:56;01:21:58;"Like, they really stunk up the joint."""
01:21:58;01:21:59;"[laughs]"
01:21:59;01:22:02;"Or is it always just like, ""They were amazing."""
01:22:02;01:22:04;"No, I mean, well, it depends."
01:22:04;01:22:06;"They're harsh fans, don't they?"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"For sure. And there's even--"
01:22:08;01:22:11;"Oh, God, I don't know who to attribute it to,"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"but there's, like, there's some jam--"
01:22:13;01:22:14;"[laughs]"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"There are-- I mean, you know, like,"
01:22:16;01:22:19;"I think at the show, everyone's grooving."
01:22:19;01:22:22;"But there's-- like any community, music community,"
01:22:22;01:22:25;"there's, like, you know, the people that are very snipey."
01:22:25;01:22:26;"But there's, like, this--"
01:22:26;01:22:27;"I don't know who to credit it to,"
01:22:27;01:22:30;"but there's, like, a jam meme account"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"that I saw this-- I saw the shirt of this"
01:22:32;01:22:33;"at one of the shows."
01:22:33;01:22:34;"Uh-huh."
01:22:34;01:22:38;"That it was, um, the thing is, ""Let Fish Suck."""
01:22:38;01:22:39;"Uh-huh."
01:22:39;01:22:40;"And it's kind of like, you know,"
01:22:40;01:22:41;"sometimes they have bad nights,"
01:22:41;01:22:44;"sometimes, like, not every song for everyone is a banger."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"I've definitely been to shows that, like,"
01:22:46;01:22:49;"I left, like, eh, it wasn't-- didn't feel great."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"Mm-hmm."
01:22:50;01:22:52;"But if you're already as deep in as I am"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"and as a lot of people are,"
01:22:54;01:22:56;"to be honest, I leave that show being like,"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"""Damn, I want to catch the next one."""
01:22:58;01:23:00;"'Cause I, like, once you get the--"
01:23:00;01:23:01;"See, that's cool."
01:23:01;01:23:03;"--high, you kind of, like, you want to, like--"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"It's all part of the story."
01:23:05;01:23:06;"Yeah, exactly."
01:23:06;01:23:08;"Yeah, it's a little, like, sports-- sports vibe, too."
01:23:08;01:23:10;"Like, you got your stats geeks."
01:23:10;01:23:11;"Mm-hmm."
01:23:11;01:23:12;"You really have stats geeks with Fish."
01:23:12;01:23:14;"And then-- yeah, and then people being like,"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"""Oh, man, the guys aren't in great shape,"""
01:23:16;01:23:18;"and, you know, pointing fingers or whatever."
01:23:18;01:23:21;"But then there is always the next-- the next one."
01:23:21;01:23:22;"They can really turn this thing around."
01:23:22;01:23:25;"I think the one notorious one I mentioned earlier"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"was ""Cup and Tree,"" which was the last show."
01:23:27;01:23:29;"It was a festival of 2.0."
01:23:29;01:23:32;"I don't know them, or, you know, I don't know the story,"
01:23:32;01:23:35;"but it's noted that there was, you know,"
01:23:35;01:23:38;"it was like substances were not super pretty then"
01:23:38;01:23:39;"for the guys."
01:23:39;01:23:41;"And, like, that-- the last show in particular"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"was, like, notoriously sloppy and, like,"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"kind of sad, almost."
01:23:44;01:23:45;"Uh-huh."
01:23:45;01:23:48;"Of, like, the tight, composed stuff"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"that just, like, weren't hitting it."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"That one is kind of looked back on"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"as kind of, like, almost a sad, dark point"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"in a way that, like, the second hiatus was needed."
01:23:56;01:23:57;"Mm-hmm."
01:23:57;01:23:59;"To, you know, figure stuff out and come back"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"ready to go to your 60s."
01:24:01;01:24:03;"Do you know-- I was asking the guys,"
01:24:03;01:24:07;"and they just didn't have the vantage point."
01:24:07;01:24:09;"Do you see any young people in these crowds,"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"or is it-- is it, like, got--"
01:24:11;01:24:12;"is it really just, like, people our age?"
01:24:12;01:24:15;"'Cause I was telling them when I went to a show in '95"
01:24:15;01:24:20;"or '96, like, it felt like it was a high school/college scene."
01:24:20;01:24:21;"Mm-hmm."
01:24:21;01:24:22;"You know what I mean?"
01:24:22;01:24:25;"Do you see, like, a lot of younger people at these shows?"
01:24:25;01:24:27;"I don't think it's the majority,"
01:24:27;01:24:28;"but there is definitely, like--"
01:24:28;01:24:30;"I think especially right now in this moment,"
01:24:30;01:24:31;"for whatever reason,"
01:24:31;01:24:34;"the pendulum is swinging to--"
01:24:34;01:24:35;"has been for years,"
01:24:35;01:24:38;"but swinging towards, like, jam acceptability."
01:24:38;01:24:40;"No, there's a-- there's a fish renaissance."
01:24:40;01:24:43;"Dare I say even, like, jam being semi-cool?"
01:24:43;01:24:44;"Absolutely."
01:24:44;01:24:45;"Indie jam."
01:24:45;01:24:46;"Although you might have the same problem that we had,"
01:24:46;01:24:48;"although it sounds like you walked the--"
01:24:48;01:24:51;"the-- around more as you entered."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"We couldn't answer Nick's question"
01:24:52;01:24:55;"because our seats were too damn good."
01:24:55;01:24:56;"Oh, right."
01:24:56;01:24:57;"We don't know what's going on back there."
01:24:57;01:24:58;"Fat cats down front."
01:24:58;01:24:59;"If you ask me--"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"if you ask me who-- who was at the fish show,"
01:25:01;01:25:04;"I would say some very wealthy gentlemen."
01:25:04;01:25:07;"Paul Dano and a bunch of executives."
01:25:07;01:25:10;"Paul Dano and a lot of very wealthy gentlemen"
01:25:10;01:25:13;"around 52 years old wearing fine tie-dyes."
01:25:13;01:25:14;"I mean--"
01:25:14;01:25:16;"As in captains of industry."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"It was--"
01:25:17;01:25:18;"Thought leaders."
01:25:18;01:25:19;"I see thought leaders."
01:25:19;01:25:22;"It was basically being, like, at a TED conference."
01:25:22;01:25:23;"But again--"
01:25:23;01:25:26;"But we don't know what's going on back there."
01:25:26;01:25:29;"I mean, I think my seats were probably--"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"don't sound like they were quite as good,"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"but probably around as good."
01:25:33;01:25:35;"But when you walked in under that--"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"under the underpass and the excitement's building,"
01:25:37;01:25:38;"you saw--"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"A lot of people in their 20s, for sure."
01:25:40;01:25:41;"Wait, okay, yeah, and what about"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"when you're in true jam country,"
01:25:43;01:25:47;"when you-- when you saw them in Colorado last year?"
01:25:47;01:25:48;"Yeah, it's-- it-- it really is--"
01:25:48;01:25:51;"I mean, I'm like a Soviet booster here,"
01:25:51;01:25:54;"but I mean, I'm fully in the tank."
01:25:54;01:25:57;"But it is like a-- it's a really awesome range."
01:25:57;01:26:00;"Some are contemporaries of peers of the band"
01:26:00;01:26:02;"that have been with them the whole journey."
01:26:02;01:26:04;"There are a lot of people like me"
01:26:04;01:26:07;"that probably got in at the end of 1.0."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"And there's a lot of people who, like--"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"especially 'cause Fish is the original members,"
01:26:11;01:26:16;"you know, they're still on their initial journey,"
01:26:16;01:26:19;"even if it's the fourth iteration of these four guys."
01:26:19;01:26:21;"I think there's a lot of teenagers that are like,"
01:26:21;01:26:22;"""I'm not missing this."""
01:26:22;01:26:24;"And it's still like there's a connection to the '80s"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"or a connection to the '90s."
01:26:26;01:26:27;"That there are--"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"yeah, there are a lot of young people"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"that I feel like have taken it up."
01:26:31;01:26:32;"And, you know, it's like it--"
01:26:32;01:26:35;"if you want it to be, it can be an identity thing."
01:26:35;01:26:37;"Like, you can--"
01:26:37;01:26:41;"the jam world is-- has a lot of signifiers,"
01:26:41;01:26:44;"both fashion and more-- you know, not even just music,"
01:26:44;01:26:47;"that you can grab onto in a way that's not--"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"doesn't feel that dissimilar than when I was 17"
01:26:49;01:26:50;"and got into it."
01:26:50;01:26:52;"I also bet that there's people, like,"
01:26:52;01:26:57;"who are just multi-generational jam families now."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"'Cause you know how, like, whenever you read"
01:26:59;01:27:02;"about, like, '60s stuff or you watch a movie or documentary,"
01:27:02;01:27:05;"there were these, like, father yod types"
01:27:05;01:27:09;"who basically-- they were older than the hippies,"
01:27:09;01:27:12;"but they easily could have been born in, like,"
01:27:12;01:27:14;"the '30s or even the '20s."
01:27:14;01:27:17;"Like, let's say you were born in 1925,"
01:27:17;01:27:18;"and then you're, like, Don Draper,"
01:27:18;01:27:20;"but then you start doing acid or something,"
01:27:20;01:27:21;"you're, like, 42,"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"you're hanging out in the hate or something."
01:27:23;01:27:26;"You would totally be catching, like, Grateful Dead shows."
01:27:26;01:27:29;"So if you were born, for instance, in 1925,"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"and you were, like, at early Dead shows,"
01:27:31;01:27:34;"you could easily have great-grandchildren right now."
01:27:34;01:27:37;"And I bet there are families where"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"every generation has been, like,"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"from the dead, flowed right into fish,"
01:27:41;01:27:44;"and you might have somebody right now who's, like, 14"
01:27:44;01:27:46;"who's just, like, ""I'm a fourth generation."""
01:27:46;01:27:49;"- Jam fanatic. - My great-grandpa's 98."
01:27:49;01:27:52;"- We wheeled him in. - Yeah, seriously."
01:27:52;01:27:54;"- I didn't see any 98-year-olds,"
01:27:54;01:27:57;"but I did see some young children."
01:27:57;01:27:59;"I don't think they made it to the end of the second set,"
01:27:59;01:28:03;"but on the first night, I saw some, like, 6-year-olds."
01:28:03;01:28:04;"- Wow. - One family with two kids,"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"like, around 6 or 8 or whatever."
01:28:06;01:28:07;"And you could tell, it was, like--"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"I think fish is also--"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"it's probably a pretty tight first show"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"or early-ish concert."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"You know, nothing particularly risque"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"in a non-musical sense,"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"and other than, I guess, if you're comfortable"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"with marijuana being smoked around them."
01:28:21;01:28:23;"- Nitrous, dude."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"- Well, just gotta avoid the parking lot somehow."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"- Oh, yeah, I'm sure, like, a kid,"
01:28:27;01:28:28;"and I'll see just, like, looking around"
01:28:28;01:28:30;"and seeing everybody having a great time, and--"
01:28:30;01:28:33;"- Oh, yeah, no, the crowd is so posy."
01:28:33;01:28:35;"- Yeah, I kind of feel like you could take anybody"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"to a show like that, and they would, by the end,"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"be like, ""Yeah, this was cool."""
