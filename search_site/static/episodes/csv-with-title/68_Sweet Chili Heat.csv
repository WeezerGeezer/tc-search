00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:03;00:10;"It is with a heavy heart that today we must uncover a dark secret behind Tic Tacs, one"
00:10;00:11;"of America's favorite mints."
00:11;00:18;"We'll also be talking Doritos with Phil Matariz, creator of the HBO comedy Animals."
00:18;00:23;"We'll also be joined by Chris Baio to debut his Sting and Shaggy remix."
00:23;00:28;"All this, plus the greatest hits of 2018 and 1969."
00:28;00:35;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:20;01:23;"Time Crisis, back once again."
01:23;01:25;"It feels like it's been a long time."
01:25;01:31;"Because the real hardcore TC heads, I wonder if they realize that the last episode was"
01:31;01:33;"recorded weeks in advance."
01:33;01:34;"Deeply canned."
01:34;01:36;"A little radio magic."
01:36;01:40;"That's the one that we had Dev and Dave and Despot, RL."
01:40;01:45;"The reason that we pre-recorded that one is because Jake was going on his honeymoon."
01:45;01:46;"That's right."
01:46;01:49;"Long-time listeners may remember that Jake got married."
01:49;01:51;"How long have you been married now?"
01:51;01:52;"Eight months."
01:52;01:54;"Got married in September of 2017."
01:54;01:56;"You just did a delayed honeymoon?"
01:56;01:58;"Yeah, delayed HM."
01:58;02:00;"What, you went to Italy?"
02:00;02:01;"Went to Italy."
02:01;02:02;"How was it?"
02:02;02:03;"Great trip."
02:03;02:08;"I believe we talked about it before you went that that was your first time in Europe in"
02:08;02:10;"almost 20 years."
02:10;02:15;"Yeah, I went in 2002 with Wolf Kernel."
02:15;02:16;"On tour?"
02:16;02:17;"Yeah."
02:17;02:20;"Renowned K-Records band, Wolf Kernel."
02:20;02:21;"Played drums on that tour."
02:21;02:22;"Oh, really?"
02:22;02:23;"I don't play drums anymore."
02:23;02:25;"I've never seen you play drums."
02:25;02:26;"I'm not that good."
02:26;02:28;"My drumming on that tour was very basic."
02:28;02:32;"So you were slapping the tubs for Wolf Kernel on a 2002 European tour."
02:32;02:33;"Yep."
02:33;02:35;"And that was the last time you checked across the Atlantic."
02:35;02:36;"Yep."
02:36;02:37;"So that's a big deal."
02:37;02:42;"It's a long time to be away from Europe."
02:42;02:45;"Did it feel like a big deal to be like setting foot in Italy?"
02:45;02:47;"A big deal in what sense?"
02:47;02:52;"I guess I always think for me that I think the first time I ever left the country I was"
02:52;02:55;"a teenager, like 14 with my family."
02:55;03:02;"And I think about those early trips I took from age like 14 to 22 a few times and everything"
03:02;03:06;"about it, going to the airport was such a big deal because I hadn't been on planes that"
03:06;03:08;"much as a child, basically not at all as a child."
03:08;03:12;"And there's something about like being a teen, you know, leaving the country and things feeling"
03:12;03:13;"so different."
03:13;03:14;"You notice everything."
03:14;03:18;"And it's kind of like you're in a dream the whole time you're in this other place."
03:18;03:19;"Right."
03:19;03:22;"I even remember going to Canada the first time, which I think was on a Dirty Projectors tour"
03:22;03:25;"and like being in Toronto and like the money being different."
03:25;03:27;"Just what are all these Tim Hortons everywhere?"
03:27;03:28;"Yeah."
03:28;03:30;"Just being shocked by the density of Tim Hortons."
03:30;03:36;"Then in my twenties, Vampire Weekend toured like crazy to the point that, you know, you're"
03:36;03:38;"like rolling through Amsterdam for like the fifth time or something."
03:38;03:42;"You're just kind of like, yeah, you're like jet lagged and you kind of like draw the curtain"
03:42;03:44;"and just say whatever."
03:44;03:48;"And then it's actually, I haven't traveled that much in the hiatus years."
03:48;03:53;"So I guess I was kind of thinking like, as you get older, is leaving the country less"
03:53;03:54;"exciting?"
03:54;03:57;"Did I just get a little bit like jaded from touring too much?"
03:57;04:00;"Will I be kind of psyched when I get back over there?"
04:00;04:06;"Did you do any international tourism for leisure in the last few years?"
04:06;04:07;"Not really."
04:07;04:08;"I mean, I know you went to Hawaii."
04:08;04:09;"Went to Hawaii."
04:09;04:10;"That's part of the US."
04:10;04:11;"But it's exotic."
04:11;04:12;"It's not mainland."
04:12;04:14;"I was just hitting McDonald's every day."
04:14;04:16;"I was, you know, nothing fancy."
04:16;04:18;"I mean, I've left the country here and there."
04:18;04:20;"There's been some trips, but really I've been kind of like..."
04:20;04:21;"Holding it down."
04:21;04:24;"Yeah, I've been holding it down in the old US of A."
05:03;05:11;"Also, I found that, especially when you go on tour a lot, and you'd be in like"
05:11;05:15;"the really big cities like London and Paris a lot, the more time you'd spend"
05:15;05:19;"there, the more you'd kind of realize how global culture was kind of like"
05:19;05:21;"bending into one thing."
05:21;05:22;"Sure."
05:22;05:25;"So even on that level, those like feelings I associate with the first times I ever"
05:25;05:29;"left the country of being like everything's so different, but then flash forward to"
05:29;05:34;"being in like, you know, Portland, L.A., New York, London, all like the same"
05:34;05:36;"poke restaurant."
05:36;05:37;"Wow."
05:37;05:38;"And everybody kind of dresses the same."
05:38;05:39;"But Italy's always been its own thing."
05:39;05:40;"Italy's not like that."
05:40;05:41;"Yeah."
05:41;05:43;"I mean, maybe Milan would be like that because we left for Milan."
05:43;05:45;"That definitely seemed more northern."
05:45;05:49;"But like in terms of the big towns, Rome and Florence and Siena, which I spent"
05:49;05:53;"time in on this past trip, definitely felt like a different trip."
05:53;05:57;"There weren't poke restaurants that I saw in those towns."
05:57;05:58;"But I have to say --"
05:58;06:01;"Ooh, that sounds like a good business opportunity for me."
06:01;06:03;"I did see sushi restaurants."
06:03;06:06;"Was it hard for you like with the lack of access to poke?"
06:06;06:07;"Yeah."
06:07;06:08;"Difficult."
06:08;06:09;"I made up for it."
06:09;06:12;"Talking about cutting the trip short."
06:12;06:16;"I made up for it by having pasta and red wine for lunch."
06:16;06:17;"Nice."
06:17;06:18;"We rented a car."
06:18;06:22;"And so we drew -- I remember driving into Florence and driving into Siena and"
06:22;06:27;"noticing, much like the cities in the U.S., like the outskirts would be fully"
06:27;06:29;"internationally homogenized."
06:29;06:31;"There would be like warehousing."
06:31;06:34;"You'd see like a Burger King, a Mickey D's, a Subway."
06:34;06:35;"Car dealerships."
06:35;06:36;"Hell yeah."
06:36;06:39;"And then you'd get within like the inner ring of the city."
06:39;06:44;"You'd like pass over the old moat or like drive in some like narrow gateway"
06:44;06:46;"like past the old city walls."
06:46;06:51;"And then like the zoning there must be insane because there was like nothing"
06:51;06:55;"built after like the year 1000 or whatever in any of these tiny --"
06:55;06:57;"And it seems like they have rules."
06:57;07:00;"Like Italy has done a good job of holding off Starbucks."
07:00;07:01;"Oh, hell yeah."
07:01;07:02;"Pretty well."
07:02;07:03;"Oh, I didn't see any Starbucks."
07:03;07:04;"I know there are some in Italy."
07:04;07:05;"Dude."
07:05;07:07;"I think there's a whole thing that like Starbucks said we're going to make a"
07:07;07:08;"big push in Italy."
07:08;07:10;"And then there's a lot of like blowback."
07:10;07:13;"Well, Italy has very strong coffee culture."
07:13;07:14;"Right."
07:14;07:19;"And so we flew back from Milan through Oslo to L.A.,"
07:19;07:22;"dipped into the Oslo airport for an hour."
07:22;07:24;"First thing I see, Starbucks."
07:24;07:25;"Yeah."
07:25;07:29;"And I was like, whoa, come to think of it, haven't seen one in two and a half weeks."
07:29;07:30;"Yeah."
07:30;07:32;"That got the gears turning."
07:32;07:33;"Yeah."
07:33;07:37;"And I was like, yeah, Italy has got very strong established coffee culture."
07:37;07:39;"Which is something that you have to protect."
07:39;07:40;"Hell yeah."
07:40;07:43;"It's not as easy as just saying like, well, our country has strong coffee"
07:43;07:44;"culture, so we don't want Starbucks."
07:44;07:47;"Actually, like France also has strong coffee culture."
07:47;07:49;"Are there Starbucks everywhere?"
07:49;07:50;"I think there's some Starbucks."
07:50;07:54;"But one thing I noticed over the years that I've been going to Paris is the"
07:54;07:56;"rise of the McCafe."
07:56;07:59;"Is McCafe McDonald's with a coffee emphasis?"
07:59;08:01;"Or what is the McCafe?"
08:01;08:03;"I think sometimes it's literally just the same menu."
08:03;08:08;"But I've seen times where it was kind of like a kiosk within a McDonald's that"
08:08;08:12;"maybe had its own window on the street where you could order a cappuccino,"
08:12;08:13;"something of that nature."
08:13;08:16;"I was hitting cappuccinos in Italy."
08:16;08:17;"And espressos?"
08:17;08:18;"Big time."
08:18;08:19;"It's just standing up at the bar."
08:19;08:23;"Seinfeld, number crunch on number of Starbucks in Italy?"
08:23;08:29;"I don't have the number of Starbucks, but I will tell you that as of 2017,"
08:29;08:31;"there were zero Starbucks."
08:31;08:32;"In the whole country?"
08:32;08:33;"It sounds like a number to me."
08:33;08:34;"Per eater."
08:34;08:39;"And they opened their first location in the whole country this year."
08:39;08:40;"In Milan?"
08:40;08:41;"Yes."
08:41;08:43;"Nailed that."
08:43;08:44;"I feel great about that."
08:44;08:47;"And I don't even know, because I'm reading an article from 2017,"
08:47;08:48;"so I don't even know if that happened."
08:48;08:51;"It seems like they were just planning to do it."
08:51;08:53;"Not a Starbucks country."
08:53;08:54;"Respect."
08:54;08:55;"That's cool."
08:55;08:56;"Mad respect."
08:56;08:58;"Anyway, Italy ruled."
08:58;08:59;"It's a great country."
09:28;09:30;"Speaking of Italy, on today's show,"
09:30;09:33;"I want to talk about one of my favorite Italian candies."
09:33;09:34;"OK."
09:34;09:36;"I'm talking, of course, about Tic Tacs."
09:36;09:38;"Didn't know that was Italian."
09:38;09:41;"Yeah, neither did I until I looked it up today."
09:41;09:42;"Why'd you look it up?"
09:42;09:46;"Well, I think I was looking at Instagram, maybe Twitter."
09:46;09:48;"Definitely a social media platform."
09:48;09:49;"I'm not sure."
09:49;09:50;"I don't know."
09:52;09:53;"I'm not sure."
09:53;09:54;"I don't know."
09:54;09:55;"I'm not sure."
09:55;09:56;"I don't know."
09:56;09:57;"I'm not sure."
09:57;09:58;"Maybe Twitter."
09:58;09:59;"Definitely a social media platform."
09:59;10:00;"One of the big two."
10:01;10:02;"Maybe it was even Facebook."
10:02;10:03;"You're not on Facebook."
10:03;10:04;"I am on Facebook."
10:04;10:05;"Are you?"
10:05;10:06;"Yeah."
10:06;10:07;"You look, but never post?"
10:07;10:09;"I haven't posted in a long time."
10:09;10:11;"I mean, have we never talked about Facebook on this show?"
10:11;10:13;"I know you're like an early adapter."
10:13;10:14;"I'm an early adapter."
10:14;10:16;"But I thought you bailed like 10 years ago."
10:16;10:19;"I have reason to believe that I'm one of the first 2,000"
10:19;10:21;"people who was ever on Facebook."
10:21;10:22;"That's tight."
10:22;10:23;"I mean, is it?"
10:23;10:26;"I bailed, dude."
10:26;10:27;"After the election, I bailed."
10:27;10:28;"But go ahead."
10:28;10:32;"So anyway, I always associated Facebook with like being a"
10:32;10:33;"sophomore in college."
10:33;10:34;"Right."
10:34;10:36;"Then once I graduated, I didn't use it that much."
10:36;10:39;"And then also I had this weird thing where people kept making"
10:39;10:40;"fake accounts."
10:40;10:41;"Did I never tell this story?"
10:41;10:42;"No, no."
10:42;10:45;"I went to my 10th high school reunion, and I was talking to"
10:45;10:46;"this dude, Ryan Ayers."
10:46;10:47;"Great dude."
10:47;10:48;"Friend of mine."
10:48;10:49;"Yeah."
10:49;10:51;"I hadn't stayed that much in touch, but a guy I really liked,"
10:51;10:54;"and we were like having some beers at his parents house."
10:54;10:55;"What year is this?"
10:55;10:56;"The high school reunion?"
10:56;10:58;"It must have been '28."
10:58;11:00;"I remember I was finishing the last Vampire Weekend album,"
11:00;11:03;"and me and Wes, one of my oldest friends."
11:03;11:04;"Like '13?"
11:04;11:05;"No, wait."
11:05;11:06;"2012."
11:06;11:07;"This would have been 2012."
11:07;11:10;"So we're hanging out at this guy's parents house after the"
11:10;11:13;"reunion, and he was like, ""Hey, that's pretty cool."
11:13;11:16;"When you posted that Smashing Pumpkins video the other day,"
11:16;11:18;"I hadn't heard that song in a while."""
11:18;11:19;"And I was like, ""Posted on what?"""
11:19;11:21;"And he's like, ""On Facebook."""
11:21;11:23;"And I was like, ""I don't think I've actually posted anything on"
11:23;11:24;"Facebook in a while."""
11:24;11:25;"And he's like, ""Yeah, you have."""
11:25;11:26;"And he showed me."
11:26;11:28;"And there's like somebody had actively made a fake account,"
11:28;11:31;"and they friended people I'd gotten to high school with,"
11:31;11:33;"and they weren't even doing anything crazy."
11:33;11:35;"They were just like posting Smashing Pumpkins videos and being like,"
11:35;11:39;"""Yo, remember the '90s when we were tweens?"""
11:39;11:41;"That's crazy."
11:41;11:43;"That kind of bugged me out because I was like,"
11:43;11:47;"obviously there's a lot of potential for weirdness."
11:47;11:52;"And I remember I had some people hit up Facebook and try to shut down"
11:52;11:55;"a bunch of these fake accounts, but that was the worst."
11:55;11:56;"I'd never heard anything bad."
11:56;12:00;"I'd never heard somebody saying, ""Somebody started sending me"
12:00;12:01;"crazy messages."""
12:01;12:04;"But that was just so unnerving, just like somebody holding it down"
12:04;12:05;"just being like--"
12:05;12:08;"So there were multiple Ezra Koenig fake accounts."
12:08;12:09;"Yeah."
12:09;12:13;"And they were all just posting like SP videos."
12:13;12:14;"I guess so."
12:14;12:15;"That's an interesting impulse."
12:15;12:18;"I mean, yeah, maybe just like somebody would get home from work"
12:18;12:21;"and just kind of imagine what it would be like."
12:21;12:23;"And also it's interesting that this person was like friending people"
12:23;12:24;"I went to high school with."
12:24;12:27;"It's not like they were trying to like even--"
12:27;12:29;"Maybe it was somebody I went to high school with just being weird"
12:29;12:30;"or something."
12:30;12:31;"Yeah."
12:31;12:36;"It reminds me--this is kind of a weird story in terms of like fake identities."
12:36;12:41;"In a benign sense, I worked at a nursery, like a plant nursery,"
12:41;12:42;"like a greenhouse."
12:42;12:43;"Okay."
12:43;12:44;"Yeah, that's on brand."
12:44;12:46;"You had like a bunch of 3-year-olds."
12:46;12:47;"Yeah, yeah."
12:47;12:51;"Now this would have been 1996, so I would have been like 19."
12:51;12:52;"Yeah."
12:52;12:55;"And there was like a photographer that came from the local paper."
12:55;12:59;"It was like, ""Hey, we're doing a story on the nursery"
12:59;13:00;"and we're going to shoot you guys."""
13:00;13:04;"And we were just like standing in the greenhouse like weeding"
13:04;13:05;"and like planting stuff."
13:05;13:07;"And I was like, ""Oh my God."""
13:07;13:09;"And they shot all these pictures of me."
13:09;13:11;"And they're like, ""What's your name?"""
13:11;13:14;"And I said, ""Steven Malkemis."""
13:14;13:17;"[laughter]"
13:17;13:22;"Because huge pavement head at the time--still am--and I was like,"
13:22;13:23;"""This would be kind of funny."""
13:23;13:28;"For some of our younger listeners or our older listeners who don't give a [bleep]"
13:28;13:31;"about indie rock, Steven Malkemis was in a band called Pavement,"
13:31;13:33;"considered a seminal indie rock band of the '90s."
13:33;13:34;"Considered?"
13:34;13:38;"First of all, everyone that listens to this show,"
13:38;13:42;"if they're a Vampire Weekend fan, gives an F about indie rock."
13:42;13:44;"I don't need you throwing shade at indie rock."
13:44;13:48;"I'm not throwing--By the way, I was literally listening to Pavement last night."
13:48;13:49;"What album?"
13:49;13:50;"Wowie Zowie because I never--"
13:50;13:51;"Oh, I love that record."
13:51;13:54;"I was wondering if Wowie Zowie was considered a double album."
13:54;13:55;"Oh, interesting."
13:55;13:57;"No, it's like 19 or 20 tracks."
13:57;13:59;"No, it's like a long--it's like an hour, right?"
13:59;14:00;"Not a double."
14:00;14:01;"Yeah, but it's 18 songs."
14:01;14:02;"But it might be on vinyl."
14:02;14:03;"It might be four sides."
14:03;14:04;"Anyway, I was thinking about Pavement."
14:04;14:08;"I felt like it had been fashionable to say you don't like Pavement for a while"
14:08;14:13;"because I think Pavement was considered kind of like the old white male rock critic kind of thing."
14:13;14:14;"Sure."
14:14;14:16;"And it became kind of unfashionable."
14:16;14:19;"Like Pavement became a shorthand for being like, ""Oh, what?"
14:19;14:21;"Great music is only made by Pavement?"""
14:21;14:25;"Right, like nerdy, literate college rock."
14:25;14:30;"Right, whereas for a long time that got respect, whereas pop or hip hop didn't,"
14:30;14:34;"whereas now I think at least in the critical universe that things have evened out."
14:34;14:37;"But anyway, I was thinking about Pavement, and I was like, ""You know what?"
14:37;14:38;"Pavement has some tunes, man."""
14:38;14:43;"I'm not saying that Pavement is ever going to top the year-end lists again, let alone the charts,"
14:43;14:46;"but I was like, ""You know what?"
14:46;14:48;"There's nothing cool about hating on Pavement."
14:48;14:49;"Throw in some Pavement."""
14:49;14:55;"Maybe someone's going to save me."
14:55;14:59;"My heart is made of gravy"
14:59;15:04;"And the lapses swim from lunatics don't care"
15:04;15:08;"Open up your stocking"
15:08;15:12;"Pull out all the things you never wanted"
15:12;15:16;"From room service calls"
15:16;15:21;"Room service calls"
15:21;15:28;"Open up your pants and let me see the things you keep in there"
15:28;15:32;"I want to split up 50/50"
15:32;15:36;"That's the way we do it in this rose town"
15:36;15:40;"I've got all the glory in the world"
15:40;15:44;"I hope it doesn't floor you before you go"
15:44;15:48;"Room service calls"
15:48;15:52;"In the random halls"
15:52;15:53;"Go!"
15:53;15:58;"I remember you used to hate on them like 10 years ago, and I was like, ""Come on, man."
15:58;16:01;"I know you're flexing. You have a young career going."""
16:01;16:02;"I was flexing."
16:02;16:07;"You need to front to the previous generation, but I was also in between the generations."
16:07;16:09;"I never publicly hated on bands."
16:09;16:12;"To me, you would be like, ""That band's whack."""
16:12;16:16;"And I'd be like, ""Get out of here. You're doing your music. Come on. Get out of here."""
16:16;16:17;"So I'm glad you're back around."
16:17;16:20;"There are a lot of Pavement songs that I like."
16:20;16:22;"No, Pavement's cool."
16:22;16:24;"And also, look, you're right."
16:24;16:25;"It's always--"
16:25;16:28;"Well, okay, that's been settled here at D.C."
16:28;16:29;"It's always been--"
16:29;16:30;"Pavement's cool."
16:30;16:34;"And also, first of all, I do respect Pavement. I respect Stephen Malcomist a lot."
16:34;16:39;"So I would have never said anything publicly, although I feel like he said something publicly weird about Vampire Weekend before."
16:39;16:40;"Did he?"
16:40;16:41;"That's just what happens."
16:41;16:42;"Yeah."
16:42;16:43;"The old heads."
16:43;16:44;"Generations, man."
16:44;16:48;"So just like, it's about time for me to start talking s*** about some young stuff."
16:48;16:50;"Talking smack about Sheermag."
16:50;16:54;"No, I f*** with Sheermag."
16:54;16:56;"I have the Malcomist interview where he talks about Vampire Weekend."
16:56;16:57;"Oh, what did he say?"
16:57;16:58;"It's all positive."
16:58;16:59;"Oh, really?"
16:59;17:01;"Maybe it's not the same one, then."
17:01;17:03;"There's something glowing about them. I don't know what it is."
17:03;17:04;"It's like an Apple computer--"
17:04;17:05;"Disrespectful."
17:05;17:10;"Coca-Cola thing where people don't know why, but they just want it."
17:10;17:13;"Oh, okay, so that's a little bit backhanded."
17:13;17:16;"Like, comparing the band to Coca-Cola?"
17:16;17:20;"But that's his style. I mean, he's like, you know, kind of oblique and poetic and--"
17:20;17:22;"Doesn't seem that negative to me."
17:22;17:25;"I mean, honestly, to me, Vampire and Pavement aren't that far apart."
17:25;17:27;"Especially with the lyrical content."
17:27;17:31;"Yeah, but also, you know me well and you know my vibe."
17:31;17:36;"You got a picture, like, when our first album came out, people hearing like M79 and s***."
17:36;17:41;"There was a certain type of listener who would have been like, ""Whatever happened to good s*** like Pavement?"""
17:41;17:42;"Right."
17:42;17:43;"[singing]"
17:43;17:46;"Yeah. Oxford Comma, though, is pretty pavement."
17:46;17:49;"[singing]"
17:49;17:51;"But even then, it's a little more pop than Pavement."
17:51;17:52;"A little bit, but it's like--"
17:52;17:53;"I think actually--"
17:53;17:55;"Almost could be a Pavement B-side in a weirdo world."
17:55;17:59;"I think one of the most true, like, classic indie rock Vampire Weekend songs--"
17:59;18:00;"Yeah?"
18:00;18:02;"Because we were playing this the other day at the rehearsal space--"
18:02;18:03;"Yeah."
18:03;18:06;"--is a deep cut rarity called Ottoman. Do you know that one?"
18:06;18:08;"Wait, how does it go? Wait, put it on."
18:08;18:11;"I think it's finally on the streaming services now."
18:11;18:14;"Because this is like-- I wrote the riff when I was a teenager."
18:14;18:19;"I was singing about it. And look, in the end, the arrangement went to a very early Vampire Weekend place."
18:19;18:23;"But the opening guitar riff, which I think I wrote when I was like 14 or 15--"
18:23;18:25;"Whoa, you go back that far?"
18:25;18:27;"[playing guitar]"
18:27;18:29;"But then I like palm muted it and stuff."
18:29;18:33;"You remember riffs from when you were 14?"
18:33;18:34;"[playing guitar]"
18:34;18:38;"But then once the cello comes in, it doesn't sound like Pavement anymore, but like--"
18:38;18:42;"[singing]"
18:42;18:44;"Imagine if it wasn't palm muted."
18:44;18:45;"Sure."
18:45;18:47;"[singing]"
18:47;18:52;"Ice baby, I saw your girlfriend and she did a little dance--"
18:52;18:53;"Yeah, who's the lyrics?"
18:53;18:55;"[singing]"
18:55;18:58;"At the Chancellor's Regatta."
18:58;19:18;"[playing guitar]"
19:18;19:23;"Yeah, now the whole presentation is so '90s indie rock, but--"
19:23;19:25;"[singing]"
19:25;19:26;"Yeah."
19:26;19:30;"[playing guitar]"
19:30;19:32;"Throw in Shady Lane."
19:32;19:34;"[singing]"
19:34;19:36;"Blind date with the Chancellor."
19:36;19:40;"We had oysters and dry Lancers and the check when it arrived."
19:40;19:42;"We went Dutch, Dutch, Dutch."
19:42;19:43;"[singing]"
19:43;19:46;"A redder shade of neck on a whiter shade of trash."
19:46;19:51;"And this emery board is giving me a rash."
19:51;19:54;"I'm flat out."
19:54;19:56;"[laughing]"
19:56;19:57;"[singing]"
19:57;20:00;"You're so beautiful to look at when you cry."
20:00;20:04;"Freeze, don't move."
20:04;20:15;"You've been chosen as an extra in the movie adaptation of the sequel to your life."
20:15;20:17;"A shady lane."
20:17;20:20;"Everybody wants one."
20:20;20:22;"A shady lane."
20:22;20:24;"Everybody needs one."
20:24;20:26;"Oh my God, oh my God."
20:28;20:30;"Oh my God, oh your God."
20:30;20:32;"Oh his God, oh her God."
20:32;20:33;"It's everybody's God."
20:36;20:39;"The world's collide."
20:39;20:42;"But all that we want is a shade."
20:42;20:46;"Bam, bam, bam, bam."
20:46;20:47;"I liked Pavement."
20:47;20:48;"Let me go full circle here."
20:48;20:49;"Yeah, wait, no."
20:49;20:53;"Because I've always thought there was a Pavement vampire weekend connection."
20:53;20:55;"More sort of in the lyrics."
20:55;20:56;"I could see that."
20:56;21:00;"Not so much in the guitar playing, but sort of the songwriting and the lyrics."
21:00;21:05;"But going back 20 years ago, when I was huge Pavement head, when they were still a band."
21:05;21:07;"You'd given Stephen Malcomus as your name."
21:07;21:08;"Yeah, exactly."
21:08;21:09;"It's a weird thing."
21:09;21:13;"So I always thought there was a connection between Pavement and the dead."
21:13;21:14;"Oh, right."
21:14;21:15;"I've heard you say this before."
21:15;21:19;"That was a very controversial opinion to have circa 1997."
21:19;21:25;"Because in indie rock circles, when I was 20, the dead were just sacrilegious."
21:25;21:26;"The dead were off limits."
21:26;21:27;"Uncool."
21:27;21:29;"And I grew up with the dead because my parents liked the dead."
21:29;21:30;"I always loved the dead."
21:30;21:35;"But I was like, there's a lot of crossover with the guitar playing."
21:35;21:42;"And even the vocal affectation of Jerry and Stephen Malcomus, pretty nasally, pretty dry"
21:42;21:43;"and straightforward."
21:43;21:45;"And yeah, unaffected."
21:45;21:49;"And sometimes Robert Hunter's lyrics could have that same kind of mix of storytelling"
21:49;21:51;"and just like straight up surrealism."
21:51;21:53;"Yeah, yeah, totally."
21:53;21:55;"I remember people just being like, are you crazy?"
21:55;22:00;"And then I remember going to a Stephen Malcomus, a very, very early Malcomus and the Jicks"
22:00;22:04;"show, secret show in Portland circa like '99."
22:04;22:06;"Like, right after Pavement broke up."
22:06;22:07;"And it was a tiny show."
22:07;22:09;"It was like maybe like 50 people there."
22:09;22:13;"So after the show, I was like, yo, Steve, I was always wondering, dude, are you into"
22:13;22:14;"the dead?"
22:14;22:16;"He's just like backing up his guitar."
22:16;22:18;"Yeah, he was just like chilling, just like having a beer at the bar."
22:18;22:19;"Yeah."
22:19;22:22;"And I was like, I was kind of nervous because I was a huge Pavement fan."
22:22;22:24;"But I was like, Steve, gotta ask."
22:24;22:25;"Yeah."
22:25;22:26;"Deadhead?"
22:26;22:28;"And he was like, he played it."
22:28;22:29;"I don't know."
22:29;22:31;"He was like, yeah, I don't know."
22:31;22:33;"I mean, I like some of the songs."
22:33;22:34;"I like Boxer Rain."
22:34;22:35;"Like that."
22:35;22:38;"He kind of like wasn't like weighing in one way or the other."
22:38;22:42;"But then smash cut 10 years later, the Jicks are covering China Cat."
22:42;22:43;"Yeah, that's how it works."
22:43;22:45;"Things go in and out of fashion."
22:45;22:46;"Right."
22:46;22:49;"And also as things age, their differences become lessened."
22:49;22:50;"Right."
22:50;22:51;"Yeah."
22:51;22:55;"Like imagine some kid who doesn't even listen to rock music now and they hear you talking"
22:55;23:00;"about the contentious debates about the dead and indie rock circles in '97."
23:00;23:04;"They're just like, it's all a bunch of old guitar s***, man."
23:04;23:05;"Right."
23:26;23:29;"Israel Koenig's Time Crisis."
23:29;23:31;"Anyway, I don't know how it got done this whole."
23:31;23:33;"But I was talking about my favorite Italian candy, which is Tic Tacs."
23:33;23:35;"Oh, yeah, dude."
23:35;23:39;"Oh, it's because we started talking about Facebook and."
23:39;23:41;"Somehow we got into pavement."
23:41;23:43;"We got into pavement."
23:43;23:46;"So anyway, Tic Tacs, I didn't realize this because, you know, it's funny."
23:46;23:49;"I would have guessed that Tic Tacs is owned by like Procter & Gamble or something."
23:49;23:53;"But when you think about it, it is a dainty little candy."
23:53;23:56;"It does have a kind of European sensibility."
23:56;23:58;"It's not crazy to think about."
23:58;24:02;"And so they were brought out in 1969 by the Italian company Ferrero."
24:02;24:03;"That's tight."
24:03;24:05;"They were originally called Refreshing Mints."
24:05;24:09;"I guess they eventually changed the name Refreshing Mints to Tic Tacs."
24:09;24:13;"And the Tic Tac referred to the sound that the container makes when open and close."
24:13;24:14;"Okay."
24:14;24:19;"So anyway, I didn't know until today that Tic Tacs were Italian, which makes me like them more."
24:19;24:23;"But the thing that I learned about them on social media made me like them less."
24:23;24:27;"And I can't remember exactly where I saw this, but it was in some meme or something."
24:27;24:34;"So Tic Tacs, I don't think the box actually says sugar-free, but very prominently on a box of Tic Tacs,"
24:34;24:37;"it says zero calories per serving."
24:37;24:43;"And it says zero grams of sugar per serving, implying that Tic Tacs are sugar-free."
24:43;24:44;"Right."
24:44;24:46;"And this is the thing about Tic Tacs."
24:46;24:50;"There's nothing remotely sugar-free or non-caloric about Tic Tacs."
24:50;24:59;"This is a fully cooked up fiction because Tic Tacs is taking full advantage of loopholes in the FDA's way of labeling things."
24:59;25:06;"So Tic Tacs can really be out there calling themselves a zero calorie, zero sugar item."
25:06;25:11;"And then you look at it, the number one ingredient of Tic Tacs is sugar."
25:11;25:13;"Of course Tic Tacs are full of sugar."
25:13;25:19;"And this is what it says on the Tic Tacs website if you go to the frequently asked questions on the Tic Tac websites."
25:19;25:20;"The whole part of the website."
25:20;25:22;"Yeah, they know nobody's going there."
25:22;25:26;"Tic Tac mints do contain sugar as listed in the ingredient statement."
25:26;25:30;"However, since the amount of sugar per serving, one mint."
25:30;25:33;"Yeah, so by the way, the serving size of Tic Tacs is one mint."
25:33;25:34;"That's whack."
25:34;25:36;"Yeah, I've never had one Tic Tac in my life."
25:36;25:39;"It's even very difficult to simply serve yourself one Tic Tac."
25:39;25:40;"Yeah."
25:40;25:45;"However, since the amount of sugar per serving, one mint, is less than 0.5 grams,"
25:45;25:50;"FDA labeling requirements permit the nutrition facts to state that there are 0 grams of sugar per serving."
25:50;25:55;"So basically, if a serving size of something has less than 0.5 grams of sugar,"
25:55;25:58;"you're allowed to just round it down to zero."
25:58;26:00;"That shouldn't be a rule to begin with."
26:00;26:01;"And here's the amazing part."
26:01;26:07;"It doesn't even matter how much sugar there is relative to the size of the portion."
26:07;26:14;"So understandably, if you were selling like a foot-long sandwich that somehow had 0.5 grams of sugar"
26:14;26:20;"and you're like, ""FDA, come on. We're giving people a big-ass sandwich that basically has no sugar."
26:20;26:21;"Can we just call it zero sugar?"""
26:21;26:23;"Maybe that-- even that doesn't make that much sense."
26:23;26:27;"But Tic Tacs, solely because the serving size is so small,"
26:27;26:32;"they can lie through their teeth and say that there's zero grams of sugar per serving."
26:32;26:33;"It's crazy."
26:33;26:34;"Why is that even a rule?"
26:34;26:35;"That's bonkers."
26:35;26:39;"I mean, I'm sure if you're like diabetic or something where you really have to watch your sugar,"
26:39;26:42;"you've learned this lesson a long time ago, but it's just-- it's just wacky."
26:42;26:49;"That's the funny thing about like companies being sketchy with really, really underestimating the serving size."
26:49;26:50;"Right."
26:50;26:51;"Very misleading."
26:51;26:53;"All these nutrition facts, they just confuse people."
26:53;26:57;"People, you're better off just saying, ""I'm not going to have any sugar or like carbs for a while,"""
26:57;27:01;"rather than like finding all these like misleading things where it's like,"
27:01;27:03;"""Well, there is some sugar, but it's very high in protein."""
27:03;27:04;"Making you do the math."
28:11;28:15;"So I was pretty negative on Tic Tacs once I found out that they were cooking the books like this."
28:15;28:16;"It's just sketchy."
28:16;28:17;"Wait, what's this Trump stuff here?"
28:17;28:23;"Well, remember that when Trump was saying all those horrible things on the Access Hollywood bus,"
28:23;28:24;"the infamous tape."
28:24;28:25;"Yeah."
28:25;28:28;"He was talking about needing Tic Tacs."
28:28;28:31;"He was talking with the guy on the bus about Tic Tacs."
28:31;28:32;"Yeah."
28:32;28:35;"Which I guess was related to his like seducing women or something."
28:35;28:37;"He needs to have that breath fresh."
28:37;28:38;"He needed a good breath."
28:38;28:41;"And Tic Tac denounced the candidate Trump and they tweeted,"
28:41;28:47;"""Tic Tac,"" not Tic Tacs, ""Tic Tac respects all women."""
28:47;28:48;"No, you don't."
28:48;28:49;"First of all, no, you don't."
28:49;28:50;"I love this."
28:50;28:56;"This inanimate object, a.k.a. candy, respects all women."
28:56;29:00;"You don't respect women enough to keep it real with them about how much sugar is in your product."
29:00;29:02;"Boom."
29:02;29:06;"We find the recent statements and behavior completely inappropriate and unacceptable."
29:06;29:08;"Tic Tac, you're 100% right."
29:08;29:13;"Donald Trump's statements are completely inappropriate and unacceptable as far as the behavior of a human being goes."
29:13;29:19;"As far as the behavior of a candy, we ask very little of you, arguably much less than we ask of a human being."
29:19;29:21;"Just be straightforward."
29:21;29:22;"Just be straightforward."
29:22;29:23;"About your ingredients."
29:23;29:24;"Yeah."
29:24;29:25;"That's all we ask."
29:25;29:27;"This is the cognitive dissonance."
29:27;29:28;"Number one ingredient, sugar."
29:28;29:31;"Amount of sugar per serving, zero grams."
29:31;29:32;"Insane."
29:32;29:34;"Why don't they say .5 grams?"
29:34;29:35;"Because the FDA doesn't make them."
29:35;29:37;"You give them an inch."
29:37;29:42;"Tic Tac, if you're listening, because we know you're such a strong advocate of women."
29:42;29:45;"The Ferraro Corporation, if you're listening."
29:45;29:54;"Well, I don't know how the Ferraro Corporation feels, but I know that Tic Tac got on Twitter and was willing to speak truth to power to our sexist piece of s*** president."
29:54;29:55;"So, oh, God."
29:55;30:01;"Imagine if, like, Trump off the back of that, the way that he got elected was, like, everybody was like, whoa, even Tic Tac's coming for Trump."
30:01;30:02;"And that was a feeling."
30:02;30:03;"Tic Tac."
30:03;30:08;"He's basically admitting to sexual assault, and then people are like, he's not going to get out of this one, remember?"
30:08;30:09;"And then the way he got out was like."
30:09;30:10;"He got out."
30:10;30:15;"You know, I got Tic Tac coming for me, talking about they respect women."
30:15;30:17;"These lying crooks."
30:17;30:18;"They're talking about."
30:18;30:20;"They're talking about it being zero grams of sugar."
30:20;30:21;"Do you believe this?"
30:21;30:24;"What is it with these people and their numbers?"
30:24;30:27;"Can you imagine, like, on the debate stage with Hillary."
30:27;30:29;"That's some crooked Tic Tac."
30:29;30:35;"I remember listening to Trump talk about the serving sides of Tic Tac's, just like stone faced."
30:35;30:36;"God."
30:36;30:37;"But you know what?"
30:37;30:38;"I do."
30:38;30:40;"I think they do make sugar free Tic Tac's."
30:40;30:41;"That's the hilarious part."
30:41;30:42;"Diet."
30:42;30:44;"Yeah, there's sugar free Tic Tac's."
30:44;30:49;"I just want to, like, go into, like, a CVS and be like, sir, do you have, like, sugar free Tic Tac's?"
30:49;30:50;"Like, oh, yeah, right there."
30:50;30:52;"They're like, what's the difference?"
30:52;30:55;"I'm looking at the."
30:55;30:57;"I'm looking at the health information on the back."
30:57;31:00;"They both seem to have zero grams of sugar."
31:00;31:06;"Yeah, does the CVS manager get that granular with his knowledge of the products?"
31:06;31:11;"It occurs to me that if a product has zero grams of sugar, it is in fact sugar free."
31:11;31:17;"Hence, the idea of there being a sugar free Tic Tac makes no sense at all."
31:17;31:20;"Riddle me this, sir."
31:20;31:22;"Anyway, boycott security."
31:22;31:24;"Anyway, should we boycott Tic Tac's?"
31:24;31:25;"I don't eat them."
31:25;31:27;"I'm an Altoids guy."
31:27;31:28;"Interesting."
31:28;31:29;"Altoids have sugar."
31:29;31:31;"Yeah, I'm not worried about it."
31:31;31:34;"I'm not scarfing handfuls of Altoids."
31:34;31:35;"One at a time?"
31:35;31:37;"I'm doing like two, three a day."
31:37;31:39;"Don't you find they're not powerful enough, though?"
31:39;31:40;"No."
31:40;31:42;"It's very kind of dull."
31:42;31:46;"Altoids were billed as being the curiously strong mint."
31:46;31:48;"Tic Tac is comparatively weak."
31:48;31:50;"What am I thinking of then?"
31:50;31:52;"Mentos is not very strong."
31:52;31:53;"Yeah, you're right."
31:53;31:59;"It's funny how Altoids, I guess they are originally English, and they always had this kind of upper crust sensibility."
31:59;32:01;"I love the tin, I gotta tell you."
32:01;32:06;"The tin is nice, and I feel like they really tried to brand it on some Harry Potter s***."
32:06;32:12;"There would always be an English person, like Altoids, curiously strong mint."
32:12;32:16;"I think that Tic Tacs now is neither here nor there."
32:16;32:22;"Do you stand for women, or are you lying to them and their other gendered counterparts?"
32:22;32:31;"I think if Altoids is like the English one, Mentos always came across as kind of like East Block, Czech Republic vibe."
32:31;32:34;"I think Tic Tacs should get back to their Italian heritage."
32:34;32:35;"That'd be cool."
32:35;32:37;"What is the most popular mint in America?"
32:37;32:39;"Seinfeld, can I get a number crunch?"
32:39;32:40;"Coming up."
32:40;32:41;"You want to guess?"
32:41;32:42;"Should I just tell you?"
32:42;32:43;"Wait, let's guess."
32:43;32:44;"Is it not Tic Tac?"
32:44;32:45;"It's not Tic Tac."
32:45;32:46;"It's not Altoids."
32:46;32:47;"It is Altoids."
32:47;32:48;"Oh, really?"
32:48;32:50;"Altoids are more popular than Tic Tacs?"
32:50;32:51;"I'm surprised, too."
32:51;32:52;"That's because they keep it real."
32:52;32:53;"By hair."
32:53;32:54;"They're straightforward."
32:54;32:55;"By how much?"
32:55;32:57;"By, looks like about 1%."
32:57;32:58;"So they're tied for first, basically."
32:58;32:59;"Number three?"
32:59;33:00;"I'm actually surprised by that."
33:00;33:01;"What's number three?"
33:01;33:03;"I don't think you're going to guess this one."
33:03;33:04;"It's Ice Breakers."
33:04;33:05;"That's not gum?"
33:05;33:07;"It's kind of a gum hybrid, I would say."
33:07;33:10;"I feel like it's somewhere between Altoids and Mentos."
33:10;33:12;"But how do you hybridize that?"
33:12;33:13;"Neither of those are gum."
33:13;33:16;"You chew and you swallow, a gum you spit out."
33:16;33:18;"Although Mentos makes gum."
33:18;33:20;"Have you ever had Mentos gum?"
33:20;33:24;"It's so confusing because the original Mentos is so close to being a gum."
33:24;33:26;"This show."
34:35;34:43;"We don't talk about mints enough on Time Crisis."
34:43;34:44;"I like this."
34:44;34:46;"We should do another mints episode."
34:46;34:48;"Anyway, we're about to get on the phone."
34:48;34:50;"You pronounce his name Phil Matarese or Phil Matarese?"
34:50;34:52;"I would say the second one, but yeah, we should ask him."
34:52;34:56;"It's Phil Matarese."
34:56;35:00;"Phil Matarese is the creator and star of Animals on HBO."
35:00;35:02;"It's a funny cartoon on HBO."
35:02;35:04;"New season starts August 3rd."
35:04;35:06;"He also makes music under the name Phil's Pills."
35:06;35:09;"He's a lifelong chips lover with a concentration on Doritos."
35:09;35:13;"Seinfeld 2000 got in touch with him because he wrote a little chain,"
35:13;35:16;"a little thread on Doritos."
35:16;35:19;"You can tell this guy's a real Doritos head."
35:19;35:21;"He's also a media industry professional."
35:21;35:24;"This is what he wrote on Twitter."
35:24;35:27;"""I try not to be too serious on here, but something has been happening over the"
35:27;35:30;"past year lately that I find deeply, deeply troubling."
35:30;35:34;"Doritos Blaze was released January 2018."""
35:34;35:35;"Now, I didn't even know about this."
35:35;35:37;"Did you know that they dropped a new Doritos this year?"
35:37;35:38;"Nope."
35:38;35:39;"Out of the loop."
35:39;35:41;"Recently on Time Crisis, we've been less interested in Doritos."
35:41;35:44;"We've been focusing more on mints, Tic Tacs, Altoids, things of that nature."
35:44;35:46;"So, we've been slacking."
35:46;35:51;"So, anyway, Doritos dropped something called Blaze in January 2018."
35:51;35:54;"According to Phil, it is a bull redundant Dorito."
35:54;35:59;"It's got no point of view and is, in my opinion, spicy for spicy's sake."
35:59;36:03;"The original rollout's bag heat marks hands on it, which is so, so lame,"
36:03;36:04;"but here's why this matters."
36:04;36:06;"So, look at this, Jake."
36:06;36:10;"This is the bag of Blaze, and it has almost like these red hot fingers on it."
36:10;36:11;"I'm seeing it."
36:11;36:16;"As if even gripping the bag would cause fire or lava."
36:16;36:20;"You know what it reminds me of is the Coors Light super cold can."
36:20;36:21;"Yeah."
36:21;36:26;"Where there's some sort of weird thermal reading where if it's super cold--"
36:26;36:27;"Oh, the mountains change colors?"
36:27;36:30;"Yeah, it goes to blue or something."
36:30;36:31;"Just real whack."
36:31;36:35;"And so, the reason that Phil's so upset about this is the Doritos brand has cannibalized"
36:35;36:38;"one of their most beloved flavors, sweet chili spice."
36:38;36:40;"So, even then, I'm like, ""This guy's a super Doritos head."""
36:40;36:41;"He's a head."
36:41;36:44;"Because to even call sweet chili spicy--"
36:44;36:45;"A classic."
36:45;36:47;"Yeah, to me, the classics are--"
36:47;36:48;"Nacho cheese."
36:48;36:49;"Nacho cheese and ranch."
36:49;36:50;"Yeah, that's it."
36:50;36:52;"Democrats and Republicans, man."
36:52;36:55;"Binary, but Phil clearly, he's a third party guy."
36:55;36:58;"On my walk today, I stopped by three stores and none of them had it."
36:58;37:01;"Two had Blaze, and that's not okay because it's my favorite."
37:01;37:05;"So, basically, this new one, Blaze, is supplanting his favorite."
37:05;37:08;"Blaze is now the third purple bag on the Doritos primary roster."
37:08;37:11;"I'm very worried for the future SSC."
37:11;37:12;"Sweet spicy chili."
37:12;37:13;"Here's what you can do to help."
37:13;37:16;"Don't buy Blaze and buy the shit out of sweet spicy chili."
37:16;37:22;"If you want spicy, go for Flama's, Tapatio, or my second favorite, Salsa Verde."
37:22;37:28;"You know what's so weird about this is in Canada, sweet spicy chili is called sweet chili heat."
37:28;37:29;"Really?"
37:29;37:30;"Yeah."
37:30;37:31;"Sweet chili heat."
37:31;37:32;"Seems like an arbitrary--"
37:32;37:34;"Sweet chili."
37:34;37:36;"So, anyway, we gotta get Phil on the phone."
37:36;37:39;"I gotta write a song called Sweet Chili Heat."
37:39;37:40;"Jake's making a note on his phone."
37:40;37:41;"I'm making a note."
37:41;37:44;"She's my sweet, sweet chili heat."
37:44;37:47;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
37:47;37:51;"[phone ringing]"
37:51;37:52;"Hey, is that Phil?"
37:52;37:54;"Yes, this is Phil."
37:54;37:55;"Hey, Phil, how are you doing?"
37:55;37:57;"You're on Time Crisis with Ezra and Jake."
37:57;37:58;"Hey, Ezra, how's it going, man?"
37:58;37:59;"Hey, Jake, how's it going, pal?"
37:59;38:00;"Hey, what's up?"
38:00;38:02;"Great to have you on the show, man."
38:02;38:04;"Fan of your work, fan of Animals."
38:04;38:07;"First question, though, did not know how to pronounce your last name."
38:07;38:10;"Oh, yeah, just flatten it out, man, Matt-a-reece."
38:10;38:12;"It's not like too Italian or anything like that, just Matt-a-reece."
38:12;38:15;"Okay, 'cause I was saying it real Italian before."
38:15;38:16;"All right, Phil Matt-a-reece."
38:16;38:18;"How do you say your last name?"
38:18;38:19;"That's a good question."
38:19;38:24;"My family actually says Canig, but everybody always says Conig, so we kind of like gave up."
38:24;38:27;"[laughing]"
38:27;38:30;"I was basically raised not to correct people 'cause they're always like,"
38:30;38:32;"""None of these are the real pronunciations. Maybe you feel the same way."""
38:32;38:34;"It's like in the homeland, they pronounce it differently."
38:34;38:36;"It's a mess. The surnames are a mess."
38:36;38:38;"Dave, what's your last name?"
38:38;38:39;"Longstreath."
38:39;38:42;"Oh, yeah, Longstreath, Phil. That's easy."
38:42;38:44;"Yeah, nobody's getting that wrong."
38:44;38:46;"People do. They say Longstretch."
38:46;38:47;"Oh, yeah, that's true."
38:47;38:48;"That happens all the time."
38:48;38:52;"Pete, are you on Twitter with your brother? I'm probably going to see you guys in L.A."
38:52;38:55;"I'm not, but I'll be at the L.A. shows in attendance."
38:55;38:57;"You guys can have a beer together."
38:57;39:01;"So, Phil, we were just reading through some of your Doritos tweets."
39:01;39:04;"So, Jake and I would love to talk about Doritos,"
39:04;39:08;"but we got to admit that you seem like a true Doritos head"
39:08;39:15;"because you refer to spicy sweet chili as a beloved Doritos flavor."
39:15;39:17;"That's barely even on our radar, man."
39:17;39:20;"So, have you just always been a huge Doritos fan or what?"
39:20;39:23;"Yeah, it's pretty ingrained in who I am."
39:23;39:31;"I have a very early distinct memory of my grandma introducing me to Cool Ranch Doritos"
39:31;39:35;"and literally thinking, like, my grandma is, like, pretty cool."
39:35;39:37;"I didn't know this, but my grandma is pretty cool."
39:37;39:40;"She's got the hook up with some crazy shit."
39:40;39:43;"So, it's, like, deep-seated into me."
39:43;39:47;"Personally, I think chips are, like, the best food,"
39:47;39:51;"and I think Doritos are the best version of the best food."
39:51;39:54;"So, I'm, like, I'm kind of a nut job about Doritos, yes."
39:54;39:58;"And so you have Doritos in your home, your abode?"
39:58;39:59;"You know what, gang?"
39:59;40:03;"I try not to keep them in there because once I get to big bags,"
40:03;40:05;"I usually just eat the whole thing or I come close to it."
40:05;40:10;"I'm like a dog with dog food where I'll just keep eating until I get sick."
40:10;40:14;"So, what I like to do is I like to, like, you know, if I'm out and about,"
40:14;40:18;"if I'm getting gas or something, I'll go in and I'll get a smaller bag."
40:18;40:21;"Probably not as good for the environment because I'm using more packaging,"
40:21;40:23;"but you got to do what you got to do, gang."
40:23;40:26;"And your favorite flavor is--see, I'm confused about this"
40:26;40:29;"because some of the bags say Spicy Sweet Chili,"
40:29;40:33;"but you also called it Sweet Chili Spice--what is it?"
40:33;40:35;"I probably just got it wrong."
40:35;40:37;"I'll be honest, it's kind of a clunky name."
40:37;40:39;"It is Spicy Sweet Chili."
40:39;40:42;"Seinfeld2000 was telling us in Canada where he comes from,"
40:42;40:43;"what's it called?"
40:43;40:45;"Sweet Chili Heat."
40:45;40:48;"Sweet, sweet chili heat."
40:48;40:49;"We just wrote a song."
40:49;40:52;"Seems like an arbitrary change on that title for the Canadian market,"
40:52;40:53;"but there you have it."
40:53;40:58;"See, I'm starting to see some problems already with my favorite flavor."
40:58;41:01;"It's that it's, like, up north we're getting a different name."
41:01;41:03;"We can't get the name right here in America."
41:03;41:05;"Gang, what's your take on Doritos?"
41:05;41:06;"Where do you guys stand?"
41:06;41:10;"So I'm guessing you're probably in the nacho cheese, Cool Ranch world."
41:10;41:11;"Exactly."
41:11;41:13;"Jake and I are kind of meat and potatoes, guys."
41:13;41:16;"Those are the two that we're familiar with."
41:16;41:19;"Everything beyond that I consider, like, a novelty."
41:19;41:20;"Like Doritos 3D?"
41:20;41:22;"What was that?"
41:22;41:24;"That's one-off sort of stuff."
41:24;41:26;"They do that kind of stuff here and there."
41:26;41:30;"But Spicy Sweet Chili, that was a primary roster."
41:30;41:37;"I would say Salsa Verde is a primary roster as well as probably Spicy Nacho."
41:37;41:38;"That would be, like--"
41:38;41:39;"Salsa Verde."
41:39;41:43;"Wait, so wait, how big is the primary roster?"
41:43;41:48;"Like if I go into just like a Vons or like an Arco gas station."
41:48;41:51;"That's an issue I'm having right now with my favorite flavor."
41:51;41:52;"We'll get to that in a moment."
41:52;41:55;"But I think about four, I would say."
41:55;42:00;"So Doritos, Cool Ranch, always going to be everywhere, basically no matter where you go."
42:00;42:06;"After that, my personal experience, even having moved from New Jersey,"
42:06;42:10;"Pennsylvania, New York to out here in Los Angeles,"
42:10;42:15;"I've been able to get Spicy Sweet Chili pretty regularly at gas stations,"
42:15;42:19;"your Wawa's, your food stores, as well as Spicy Nacho."
42:19;42:22;"So I guess those would be my primary roster."
42:22;42:23;"That's the top four."
42:23;42:25;"And it sounds like you're, like, spicy."
42:25;42:26;"Yeah, I do."
42:26;42:28;"But I have a limit."
42:28;42:35;"And I'll tell you what, the new mother [bleep] that came out of the gate, Blaze, is too spicy."
42:35;42:39;"It's knocking Spicy Sweet Chili off of the primary roster."
42:39;42:40;"That's my big issue."
42:40;42:42;"That's what I keep griping about online."
42:42;42:43;"It tastes like nothing."
42:43;42:44;"It's just spicy for spicy's sake."
42:44;42:47;"It's vague, uncharacteristic flavor."
42:47;42:49;"And it's a purple bag."
42:49;42:57;"So I know that sounds silly, but this is now the third Doritos purple bag that's in production right now,"
42:57;43:02;"number one being Spicy Sweet Chili, number two being the tasty and very spicy Flamas,"
43:02;43:05;"and number three being this mother [bleep] Blaze that came out of nowhere."
43:05;43:10;"And I live in a pretty foot-trafficky area of Los Angeles, Echo Parks,"
43:10;43:19;"and I've been able to get Spicy Sweet Chili pretty regularly from varying corporate levels of, like, a 7-Eleven,"
43:19;43:25;"a liquor store near me, an AM/PM, and then just, like, a small little bodega thing."
43:25;43:33;"And four out of five places near my house, guys, have Blaze, but none of them carry Spicy Sweet Chili anymore."
43:33;43:34;"That's wild."
43:34;43:35;"I wonder how this works."
43:35;43:42;"Like, maybe on some very, like, straight-up level, the local Doritos distributor is going to these stores and saying,"
43:42;43:46;"""Listen, we're trying to push Blaze right now, so tailor your orders around it."
43:46;43:48;"If you take three bags of Blaze, we'll give you a discount."""
43:48;43:56;"You know, like, maybe there truly is a top-down directive to kind of phase out SSC and move in Blaze."
43:56;43:57;"Oh, I bet there is."
43:58;43:59;"Ice Watt."
44:28;44:33;"It's interesting, too, the way you're talking about Blaze, because the first thing that came to mind is, like,"
44:33;44:39;"you're somebody who likes spicy Doritos, so already you're a little bit left of center."
44:39;44:44;"You're not, like, a down-the-middle kind of guy, not a nacho cheese Cool Ranch guy."
44:44;44:48;"And then something comes out that is even further to the left of what you like."
44:48;44:49;"It's beyond the pale."
44:49;44:55;"It makes me think a little bit about, like, the directors and the fans who were into, like, kind of classic horror movies,"
44:55;45:01;"which in the '80s seemed so violent, like Freddy, Friday the 13th, all that stuff."
45:01;45:06;"And then you get to the Saw era, just, like, the torture movies, and then suddenly you have a lot of people pushing back,"
45:06;45:11;"being like, ""This is not what the horror genre is all about. This is just gross-out bulls--t."""
45:11;45:13;"And then everybody's like, ""I thought this is what you wanted."""
45:13;45:14;"Amen, brother."
45:14;45:19;"And they're like, ""No, no, no. Just because I like something a little bit violent onscreen"
45:19;45:21;"does not mean that I want it cranked to 200."""
45:21;45:23;"Incredible analogy."
45:23;45:25;"It really came to mind very strongly."
45:25;45:37;"We don't need that."
45:52;45:54;"Oh, right, when Trump came to office, everybody was saying that."
45:54;46:19;"I know, like, it might seem, like, so crazy and obviously in the grand scheme of things,"
46:19;46:21;"compared to all these terrible things that are happening."
46:21;46:22;"It doesn't mean a lot, but--"
46:22;46:23;"Well..."
46:23;46:27;"Well, no, but I mean, it's interesting to always look for the metaphors in our culture,"
46:27;46:28;"and Doritos are part of our culture."
46:28;46:30;"I know what you mean, too."
46:30;46:36;"There is something about, like, if spicy used to mean an alternate flavor on the spectrum"
46:36;46:39;"for people who wanted something with a little bit of kick,"
46:39;46:43;"and then they're giving something that essentially is just to, like, torture people,"
46:43;46:47;"people who are so numb to the sweet, spicy chilis of the world,"
46:47;46:51;"that they just want something that just, like, almost just hurts them."
46:51;46:56;"It's extremist."
46:56;47:00;"So in some weird way, it's like, when things are pushed to an extreme, it's like,"
47:00;47:05;"yeah, what's going on in a country where people need to, like, hurt themselves--"
47:05;47:08;"Yeah, just to feel something."
47:09;47:12;"And you think about, like, the prevalence of sriracha, too."
47:12;47:17;"I remember the first time I had it, whenever that was, maybe, like, ten years ago now,"
47:17;47:20;"to me, it was so spicy."
47:20;47:25;"It was, like, the craziest thing to put on your food, but now I almost, like, treat it like ketchup."
47:25;47:29;"So maybe there is a slight, I don't know, evolutionary--"
47:29;47:31;"No, and you're right, like, if you're--"
47:31;47:34;"There's definitely, like, places where just that."
47:34;47:36;"Some people grow up with spicy food and some people don't,"
47:36;47:42;"but it sounds like Blaze is going beyond any kind of recorded culture"
47:42;47:45;"that any anthropologist has ever seen."
47:45;47:47;"Blaze is amoral."
47:47;47:48;"Yeah, Blaze is amoral."
47:48;47:49;"I think it is."
47:49;47:54;"The chips themselves actually have way more seasoning on it, too."
47:54;47:56;"You look at, like, a nacho cheese, it's, like, a beautiful thing."
47:56;47:59;"You can see the tortilla under it, all that sort of stuff,"
47:59;48:05;"but this thing is, like, a piece of sandpaper, almost, with the amount of seasoning left on it."
48:05;48:07;"It's really kind of grotesque."
48:07;48:09;"Yeah, it's strange."
48:09;48:12;"I want to make a commercial for Doritos Blaze."
48:12;48:15;"That's just the Johnny Cash Nine Inch Nails cover."
48:15;48:20;"I hurt myself today to see if I still--"
48:20;48:22;"All right, well, Phil, thanks so much for calling in."
48:22;48:24;"We hope you'll call in again and talk about Doritos."
48:24;48:28;"Real quick question, because this has been brewing on the show for a few months,"
48:28;48:31;"because the word ""chip"" connotes different things to different people."
48:31;48:34;"I assume for you, the first chip you think of as Doritos for other people"
48:34;48:36;"might be a potato chip like Lay's."
48:36;48:39;"If you were having a party and you sent your friend out,"
48:39;48:42;"they said, ""Can I go grab anything from the corner store?"""
48:42;48:45;"And you said, ""Sure, I've already got a bunch of beer. Grab some chips."""
48:45;48:49;"And they came back with a whole bunch of Cheetos."
48:49;48:50;"Would you think that was weird?"
48:50;48:53;"I would think that's weird. I wouldn't be too happy with that."
48:53;48:57;"It's too much of a swing in one direction. It's too niche of a thing."
48:57;49:02;"And you're not getting the same mouth sensation as a chip"
49:02;49:05;"when you were asking for something as specific as a chip."
49:05;49:08;"You want a very specific crunch."
49:08;49:12;"Right. It's not a chip. On a very basic level, they disobeyed the order."
49:12;49:14;"It's not a chip."
49:14;49:17;"That is not a good friend. That is not a good friend."
49:17;49:18;"Not a good listener, I think."
49:18;49:21;"I don't know why some people think-- and look, I love Cheetos."
49:21;49:23;"I have nothing against Cheetos, but it's just fundamentally--"
49:23;49:25;"that would be like if you asked somebody to go grab some chips"
49:25;49:27;"and they came back with a big box of saltines."
49:27;49:29;"What's the difference? Jake's shaking his head."
49:29;49:32;"No, that would drive me up the wall."
49:32;49:34;"What about goldfish?"
49:34;49:36;"Are goldfish for children or adults?"
49:36;49:40;"I think goldfish are for children. Frankly, I don't care for goldfish."
49:40;49:43;"It gets all too gummed up in my teeth."
49:43;49:47;"You have like four and all of a sudden it's just-- it's kind of just a round."
49:47;49:49;"That's a great point. That's just a great point."
49:49;49:51;"You know what I just thought of talking to Phil too?"
49:51;49:52;"It's very dry."
49:52;49:53;"It's so dry."
49:53;49:55;"But another thought I just had talking to Phil,"
49:55;49:57;"because we talk about goldfish all the time on this show."
49:57;49:59;"It's a great show, Phil."
49:59;50:01;"You know one-- yeah."
50:01;50:03;"I got to get off the music, gang."
50:03;50:04;"It's an excellent radio show."
50:04;50:09;"But you know how we really know that goldfish are for children?"
50:09;50:11;"It's because there's no goldfish blaze."
50:11;50:14;"There's no three alarm fire spicy goldfish."
50:14;50:15;"Because you would--"
50:15;50:16;"Well, they keep it classy."
50:16;50:18;"No, it's because you would never feed that to children."
50:18;50:20;"No, the blaze is for children."
50:20;50:21;"No."
50:21;50:22;"Man children."
50:22;50:24;"Okay, maybe for man children."
50:24;50:26;"But no, there's like rainbow goldfish."
50:26;50:28;"There's all-- there's different types of goldfish."
50:28;50:35;"But there's no five alarm spicy nacho chili heat."
50:35;50:38;"You're not going to see that under the Pepperidge Farm banner."
50:38;50:39;"Yeah, no, Pepperidge--"
50:39;50:40;"It's a classy company."
50:40;50:44;"No, because Pepperidge Farm is like-- is old school like Puritan."
50:44;50:45;"No spice."
50:45;50:46;"Yeah."
50:46;50:47;"Yeah, no spice."
50:47;50:50;"You're not going to see blaze in a Ziploc bag anytime soon."
50:50;50:52;"Pepperidge Farm is waspy."
50:52;50:55;"They traced their heritage all the way directly back to England."
50:55;50:57;"No spice."
50:57;50:59;"All right, we figured something out."
50:59;51:00;"All right, thanks so much for calling in, Phil,"
51:00;51:03;"and everybody boycott Doritos Blaze."
51:03;51:04;"Please do."
51:05;51:10;"Buy spicy sweet chili or sweet spicy chili or spicy sweet heat if you're in Canada."
51:10;51:11;"Thanks for having me, dudes."
51:11;51:12;"All right, have a good one, man."
51:12;51:13;"Have a good night."
51:13;51:14;"Thank you."
51:14;51:15;"Peace."
51:18;51:21;"[MUSIC - THE KILLA, ""YALI YALI YALI""]"
53:42;53:44;"[MUSIC - THE KILLA, ""YALI YALI YALI""]"
53:44;53:49;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
53:49;53:52;"All right, we're now joined in the studio by Chris Baio."
53:52;53:53;"Welcome back to the program."
53:53;53:55;"Pleasure to be back."
53:55;53:57;"You're kind of a Doritos guy, right?"
53:57;53:59;"Yeah, I haven't been for a while."
53:59;54:02;"I guess we were just talking off mic about Doritos."
54:02;54:06;"But I've lived in England the last five years."
54:06;54:09;"But they're not as spicy over there."
54:09;54:11;"It's interesting to come in the middle of that conversation"
54:11;54:13;"because I haven't tried these Blays,"
54:13;54:15;"and I'm curious how they relate to the other."
54:15;54:16;"Oh, yeah, you love spicy stuff."
54:16;54:18;"Yeah, I might feel differently from Phil,"
54:18;54:21;"but I have to try it before I can definitively weigh in."
54:21;54:24;"But yeah, I always liked spicy nacho when I was growing up."
54:24;54:26;"We got to get you some Doritos, Blays."
54:26;54:27;"Yeah, I'd love that."
54:27;54:32;"Off mic about Doritos is the best phrase ever."
54:32;54:37;"We had a hot mic, hot Doritos conversation."
54:37;54:40;"So, Chris, last time you were on the show,"
54:40;54:44;"you were telling us about your relationship to Sting and Shaggy,"
54:44;54:46;"who recently put out an album."
54:46;54:51;"And I'll say that things have only heated up between me and them since then."
54:51;54:55;"So we were talking to you as the rollout was happening for the Sting and Shaggy album."
54:55;54:56;"Yeah."
54:56;54:58;"So what's been the fallout since the album?"
54:58;55:00;"Fallout?"
55:00;55:04;"I mean, I feel like in America it didn't get great reviews."
55:04;55:06;"There's some haters."
55:06;55:10;"Well, I think that a lot of the reviews did point out"
55:10;55:13;"and notice that they have like an undeniable chemistry."
55:13;55:17;"And it is even like some of the maybe mediocre reviews would point out that like,"
55:17;55:20;"you know, Sting sounds like he's having a great time."
55:20;55:23;"He hasn't sounded fun on a record in forever."
55:23;55:25;"And you kind of can't knock that ultimately."
55:25;55:26;"Right."
55:26;55:27;"It went in at number one."
55:27;55:32;"I looked this up before I came over here in Argentina, Austria, Poland, and Germany."
55:32;55:34;"What about America?"
55:34;55:36;"It went in at number 40 in America."
55:36;55:37;"Wow."
55:37;55:39;"So there was actually an interview with Shaggy about it,"
55:39;55:43;"and he said that he feels like the U.S. market is so like obsessed with youth"
55:43;55:45;"that that was kind of what hurt them."
55:45;55:47;"You know, he's kind of right."
55:47;55:49;"I think that's always been the case a little bit."
55:49;55:51;"Like I always noticed even in the U.K.,"
55:51;55:54;"which is not so different from America in many ways,"
55:54;55:58;"over there it's like the kind of classic U.K. aging song."
55:58;56:01;"Like a Paul Weller album would always be number one."
56:01;56:02;"Yeah, definitely."
56:02;56:05;"People who are like a Noel Gallagher, Liam Gallagher."
56:05;56:08;"I guess in America like a Bruce Springsteen album would probably go to number one."
56:08;56:09;"Really?"
56:09;56:11;"Like a new Springsteen record?"
56:11;56:12;"I think so."
56:12;56:13;"I don't know, maybe."
56:13;56:15;"I have no idea."
56:15;56:16;"I find that shocking."
56:16;56:18;"But generally speaking, I think Shaggy's right."
56:18;56:23;"Yeah, so like to use that example, it went in at number nine in England as opposed to 40 here."
56:23;56:25;"How did it do in Jamaica?"
56:25;56:27;"Yeah, I have no idea actually."
56:27;56:30;"America's one of the most like ageist, Marcus."
56:30;56:31;"Yeah, interesting."
56:31;56:33;"But I bet they'll sell some tickets."
56:33;56:34;"Oh yeah, definitely."
56:34;56:36;"Are they doing a tour?"
56:36;56:38;"Yeah, I mean they're doing all Europe."
56:38;56:41;"Now because I've been so outspoken in my support of Sting and Shaggy,"
56:41;56:44;"people kind of come at me with information,"
56:44;56:49;"either insider or, you know, stuff that's on TV that I'll miss."
56:49;56:54;"But like I know that they're going to be playing somewhere near where we are right now sometime in the fall."
56:54;56:59;"But I don't want to jump on their announcement because I don't believe it's been announced yet."
56:59;57:02;"But I'm getting like some really dope insider info on Sting and Shaggy."
57:02;57:05;"In addition to like just having people message me,"
57:05;57:09;"like they were on Watch What Happens Live a couple weeks ago and they really crushed it."
57:09;57:11;"So they're still having a good time doing press."
57:11;57:13;"They were so good on Watch What Happens Live."
57:13;57:17;"They played this game with Andy Cohen called It Wasn't Me or Was It?"
57:17;57:22;"And Andy Cohen would like read a fact and they would both say it wasn't me."
57:22;57:27;"And Andy would try and judge from their acting who the fact pertained to."
57:27;57:29;"And he only got one out of six right."
57:29;57:30;"They were such good actors."
57:30;57:35;"It'd be stuff like this guy got his name from a sweater that he wore."
57:35;57:38;"And Sting would say it wasn't me. Shaggy would say it wasn't me."
57:38;57:42;"Oh, that is a tough one. I know the answer is Sting, but Shaggy makes more sense."
57:42;57:45;"Yeah, Andy Cohen said Shaggy and he got it wrong."
57:45;57:46;"Wow."
57:46;57:50;"I mean, they were on Tonight Show with Adam Sandler, a.k.a. The Sandman."
57:50;57:55;"There was a really good photo of Shaggy with Adam Sandler on Shaggy's socials that are really dog."
57:55;57:59;"Well, I don't know if you know, they were also on Ebro's show right here on Beats 1."
57:59;58:04;"Oh, and you can check that out if you dig into the Apple Music archives."
58:04;58:05;"Do that first."
58:05;58:06;"Maybe we should try to get them on this show."
58:06;58:07;"I'm sure they would."
58:07;58:09;"Let's take this all the way."
58:09;58:13;"I mean, see, Time Crash, we really stopped having like the kind of big celebrity guests."
58:13;58:17;"We basically don't have people come on when they're on their like their press tours."
58:17;58:18;"Right."
58:18;58:23;"We have kind of friends and family or kind of experts like Phil Matariz talking about Doritos."
58:23;58:27;"In the early days, we had, you know, Jamie Foxx."
58:27;58:28;"Yeah."
58:28;58:31;"Who else we have? Mark Ronson, Florence."
58:31;58:37;"Yeah, that's hilarious. I think about the early time crises where it's kind of me in New York just figuring stuff out."
58:37;58:41;"And it's like just interviewing like Mark and Florence. Feels like a distant memory now."
58:41;58:43;"I remember like the second show I did with you."
58:43;58:45;"You were like, yeah, Jamie Foxx is coming in."
58:45;58:48;"And I was like, what is this show?"
58:48;58:52;"I don't have anything to add to that conversation."
58:52;58:54;"Jamie, I'm going to stop you right there."
58:54;58:56;"I got to disagree with you, man."
58:56;59:00;"I mean, I think you guys should have Sting and Shaggy when they're coming through."
59:00;59:02;"I think it'd be cool. Sting and Shaggy."
59:02;59:05;"I wonder if when they go on tour, they'll be dropping some of their solo hits."
59:05;59:06;"Oh, absolutely."
59:06;59:08;"Neither of them are going to leave the stage the whole time."
59:08;59:11;"I think they have to figure out what Shaggy is going to do during like police songs."
59:11;59:14;"But Sting will play bass on It Wasn't Me, stuff like that."
59:14;59:15;"Oh, that's sick."
59:15;59:17;"No, it's going to be fun. I hope I get to see it."
59:17;59:19;"Fields of gold right into It Wasn't Me."
59:19;59:20;"Yeah, totally."
59:20;59:21;"Tight."
59:21;59:23;"That makes a world of sense."
59:23;59:28;"I'm an eagle alien. I'm an Englishman in New York."
59:28;59:31;"Maybe Shaggy will rap over some of this stuff."
59:31;59:32;"Yeah, and do some like hype man s***."
59:32;59:33;"Yeah."
59:33;59:34;"It'd be interesting."
59:34;59:36;"♪ Deputy ♪"
59:36;59:41;"Yeah, with Sting, it's tough because he just has so many hits from his like police days."
59:41;59:44;"You could just turn it into a police show all of a sudden."
59:44;59:47;"I think they'll work it out. I have all faith that they'll make it."
59:47;59:48;"Well, that's exciting."

01:01:08;01:01:14;"That's correct. They were kind enough to ask me if I'd be interested in remixing one of the songs on their album."
01:01:14;01:01:20;"And I picked the song ""Dreaming in the USA"" partially because I know it's Shaggy's favorite song on the album."
01:01:20;01:01:23;"And it was really, really fun to work on it."
01:01:23;01:01:29;"And it was pretty crazy to sort of download the stems and be able to hear an isolated Sting vocal,"

01:01:31;01:01:32;"Oh, yeah, that is crazy."
01:01:32;01:01:36;"It was very, very cool and very, very grateful that they asked me."
01:01:36;01:01:39;"And that you guys are premiering. Have you premiered other tracks on this show?"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"I think we have here and there."
01:01:41;01:01:47;"It's called like hottest record in the world on BBC One, world record on Beats One."
01:01:47;01:01:50;"What's it called on TC? What's a TC premiere called?"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"We don't have a drop because we do it so infrequently."
01:01:52;01:01:53;"You should make one."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"What are the Doritos called in Canada again?"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"Sweet Chili Heat."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"[laughter]"
01:01:59;01:02:02;"This is the time crisis. Sweet Chili Heat."
01:02:02;01:02:07;"Sweet Chili Heat, world premiere brought to you by Doritos. Sweet Chili Heat."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"[laughter]"
01:02:08;01:02:11;"You know what? People always wonder if Time Crisis is sponsored."
01:02:11;01:02:14;"The only corporation that we're affiliated with is Apple Corps."
01:02:14;01:02:19;"But it'd be funny if we just like retroactively started hitting up some of the companies that we talk about"
01:02:19;01:02:23;"and just be like, hey, listen, the guy's been talking about you a lot."
01:02:23;01:02:30;"I know we probably should have asked on the front end, but you kick a little bit of money towards old TC."
01:02:30;01:02:37;"Come on. So anyway, here's the Time Crisis Sweet Chili Heat track of the day."
01:02:37;01:02:41;"This is the Baeo remix of Dreaming in the USA by Sting and Shaggy."
01:02:43;01:02:45;"Time Crisis."
01:02:45;01:02:47;"This is the Time Crisis Sweet Chili Heat."

01:05:39;01:05:43;"It's never easy, you're looking for another way."
01:05:43;01:05:47;"God bless America, dreaming of the USA."
01:05:47;01:05:51;"Are we hysterical, dreaming of the United States?"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"Dreaming."
01:06:02;01:06:04;"I'm dreaming."
01:08:02;01:08:07;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:08:07;01:08:10;"Beats 1."
01:08:10;01:08:12;"That's the world premiere, everybody check it out."
01:08:12;01:08:15;"And check out the Sting and Shaggy album."
01:08:15;01:08:16;"What's it called again?"
01:08:16;01:08:19;"44876."
01:08:19;01:08:21;"Alright, it's time for the top five."
01:08:21;01:08:22;"You guys ready?"
01:08:22;01:08:29;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:08:29;01:08:34;"So this week we're going to be comparing the top five songs on iTunes right now"
01:08:34;01:08:37;"with the billboard hits of this week in 1969."
01:08:37;01:08:39;"Why 1969?"
01:08:39;01:08:44;"That was the year that Tic Tacs was first introduced to the market."
01:08:44;01:08:46;"Right, originally called Refreshing Mints."
01:08:46;01:08:47;"Right."
01:08:47;01:08:50;"Until people heard that Tic Tac sound when you flip open that little box."
01:08:50;01:08:53;"A red letter date in the history of mints."
01:08:53;01:08:57;"1969, a very tumultuous time in American history."
01:08:57;01:08:58;"It's the year of Woodstock, right?"
01:08:58;01:08:59;"Yeah, man."
01:08:59;01:09:02;"Woodstock and Tic Tacs, Refreshing Mints."
01:09:02;01:09:07;"The number five song that year, 1969, was by an artist called Mercy."
01:09:07;01:09:09;"The song Love Can Make You Happy."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"Do you guys know that by the title?"
01:09:11;01:09:12;"Not by the title."
01:09:12;01:09:13;"No."
01:09:13;01:09:14;"The band was formed in Tampa, Florida."
01:09:14;01:09:15;"That's cool."
01:09:15;01:09:21;"Oh, I like that."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"Oh, this sounds vibey."
01:09:23;01:09:28;"It's nice."
01:09:28;01:09:38;"Oh, yeah."
01:09:58;01:10:02;"It's just like that classic kind of like schlocky song that's kind of on"
01:10:02;01:10:05;"trend with like the cool stuff."
01:10:05;01:10:06;"Yeah, it's sort of like--"
01:10:06;01:10:07;"The hippie era."
01:10:07;01:10:10;"Hippie, dippy, but professional."
01:10:23;01:10:27;"Yeah, it's like kind of the association or the hair soundtrack."
01:10:40;01:10:42;"It's like a slight rip of--"
01:10:42;01:10:46;"Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon."
01:10:46;01:10:49;"It also reminds me of the film Zodiac."
01:10:49;01:10:50;"Is this in the film Zodiac?"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"I can't say that it was."
01:10:52;01:10:53;"It feels like this is in the movie."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"Yeah."
01:10:54;01:10:55;"Love Zodiac."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"It's a great movie."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"Well, not off to a strong start in 1969."
01:10:59;01:11:01;"I would say pretty strong."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"That's not that strong."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"I give that song a B."
01:11:05;01:11:07;"You just love the late '60s."
01:11:07;01:11:08;"It's true."
01:11:08;01:11:11;"Because it paved the way for the tasteful palette of the 1970s."
01:11:11;01:11:12;"You're not wrong."
01:11:12;01:11:13;"Let's see if old 2018--"
01:11:13;01:11:14;"Holds it down."
01:11:14;01:11:15;"--can hold it down."
01:11:15;01:11:20;"Leading into our summer of love, 2018, we got maybe the biggest rock band"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"in the world, Imagination Dragons."
01:11:22;01:11:24;"I think this is the song that's been on the charts for a while,"
01:11:24;01:11:25;"Whatever It Takes."
01:11:25;01:11:26;"Is this the kind of rap one?"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"Whatever It Takes."
01:11:28;01:11:37;"2018's not a peace and love year, man."
01:11:37;01:11:40;"It's a little more combative, you know?"
01:11:40;01:11:43;"Well, '69 wasn't a peace year either, bro."
01:11:43;01:11:53;"It's got a Cotton Eye Joe kind of vibe to it."
01:11:53;01:11:54;"Oh, yeah, I can see that."
01:11:54;01:11:55;"That's a tight call."
01:11:55;01:11:56;"Thanks."
01:11:56;01:12:06;"That's a song in the whack."
01:12:06;01:12:09;"That's kind of a good call, Seinfeld."
01:12:09;01:12:10;"Thank you."
01:12:10;01:12:16;"This song rolls too."
01:12:16;01:12:18;"This song is so much better."
01:12:18;01:12:19;"So much better."
01:12:19;01:12:20;"It is."
01:12:21;01:12:36;"It's insane that that was a hit back in the day."
01:12:36;01:12:37;"It's wild."
01:12:37;01:12:39;"Is that a sample or is that just some old guy--"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"But it is a traditional song."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"Yeah, right."
01:12:45;01:12:51;"Cotton Eye Joe."
01:12:51;01:12:54;"It's funny, you take these timeless melodies and then you put like a--"
01:12:54;01:12:55;"You put the kind of--"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"Whatever It Takes, man."
01:12:57;01:12:59;"Why are there less novelty hits now?"
01:12:59;01:13:00;"That's a good question."
01:13:00;01:13:05;"Like, I mean, there happened to be quite a few in the late '90s, early 2000s."
01:13:05;01:13:06;"Definitely."
01:13:06;01:13:10;"[singing]"
01:13:10;01:13:15;"Every time I ever used to like DJ, at some point I'd always end up into like"
01:13:15;01:13:20;"a Cotton Eye Joe, I'm blue, baba diva, da-ba, kind of moment."
01:13:20;01:13:21;"Would it go off?"
01:13:21;01:13:22;"Oh, yeah, people love that [bleep]"
01:13:22;01:13:23;"Nice."
01:13:23;01:13:28;"Although this is streaming service DJing, so just like lots of holes between everything."
01:13:28;01:13:29;"Lots of weights."
01:13:29;01:13:33;"Then the people appreciate when you play the song more because they have to wait a little longer for it."
01:13:33;01:13:35;"What's coming next?"
01:13:35;01:13:36;"No, but it's a good question."
01:13:36;01:13:37;"Why are there less novelty hits?"
01:13:37;01:13:39;"I mean, there was a huge one a few years ago."
01:13:39;01:13:40;"What was it called?"
01:13:40;01:13:41;"What Does the Fox?"
01:13:41;01:13:43;"Oh, that one."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"Yeah, yeah."
01:13:44;01:13:45;"I don't know it."
01:13:45;01:13:46;"It was also kind of like--"
01:13:46;01:13:47;"What Sound Does the Fox Make?"
01:13:47;01:13:48;"Oh, yeah."
01:13:48;01:13:52;"It was like some Norwegian guys making kind of an EDM track,"
01:13:52;01:13:55;"and the whole song was like, ""This animal makes this sound, and this animal makes this sound,"""
01:13:55;01:13:58;"and then it was kind of like, ""What Does the Fox?"""
01:13:58;01:14:02;"Yeah, it was kind of like Gangnam Style era."
01:14:02;01:14:03;"Oh, that's a good--"
01:14:03;01:14:04;"I guess that was the last wave."
01:14:04;01:14:06;"Was Gangnam Style a novelty hit?"
01:14:06;01:14:07;"I think so."
01:14:07;01:14:08;"I'd say so."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"What Does the Fox Say?"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"Jesus."
01:14:12;01:14:13;"Yeah."
01:14:13;01:14:14;"Huh."
01:14:14;01:14:26;"Dog goes woof, cat goes meow, bird goes tweet, and mouse goes squeak, cow goes moo--"
01:14:26;01:14:27;"You don't remember this, Jake?"
01:14:27;01:14:28;"No, I've never heard it."
01:14:28;01:14:31;"This is a major tune four or five years ago."
01:14:31;01:14:39;"Dog goes toot, dog say quack, then fish go blub, and the seal goes ow, ow, ow--"
01:14:39;01:14:42;"It's funny, though, because the only part that's novelty is the lyrics."
01:14:42;01:14:43;"Oh, yeah."
01:14:43;01:14:45;"The music's very straightforward."
01:14:45;01:14:46;"It's kind of sad."
01:14:46;01:14:47;"What Does the Fox Say?"
01:14:47;01:14:51;"*Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding*"
01:14:51;01:14:52;"Didn't see that coming."
01:14:52;01:14:52;"Nope."
01:14:52;01:14:54;"*What the fuck, say!"
01:14:54;01:14:58;"Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh*"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"*Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh*"
01:15:00;01:15:01;"*What the fuck, say!*"
01:15:01;01:15:02;"This was a hit?"
01:15:02;01:15:06;"Yeah, I bet- I bet the video for that song probably has-"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"Simon, let's get a number crunch."
01:15:08;01:15:08;"*laughs*"
01:15:08;01:15:10;"Over/Under a Billion."
01:15:10;01:15:12;"That one- Under. Under. Under?"
01:15:12;01:15:15;"Okay, but like- Are there videos with a billion on it?"
01:15:15;01:15:19;"Oh, there's videos- The Gangnam Style has like two or three billion."
01:15:19;01:15:19;"What?"
01:15:19;01:15:21;"That was the first one to cross a billion, right?"
01:15:21;01:15:22;"Oh my god."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"752 million views."
01:15:24;01:15:26;"For What Does the Fox Say?"
01:15:26;01:15:26;"Yeah."
01:15:26;01:15:28;"*What does the fox say?"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"Ding ding ding ding ding ding*"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"Okay, back to 1969."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"The number four song, Isley Brothers."
01:15:34;01:15:35;"*music*"
01:15:35;01:15:36;"Pretty cool."
01:15:36;01:15:38;"*music*"
01:15:38;01:15:38;"Nice."
01:15:38;01:15:42;"This is a great song. It's like, been a little like, commercialed out."
01:15:42;01:15:42;"Sure."
01:15:42;01:15:43;"*music*"
01:15:43;01:15:45;"I mean, but it's a- it's a cool song."
01:15:45;01:15:47;"*music*"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"Wendy's new Caesar salad."
01:15:49;01:15:51;"I know, it's like such a commercial song now."
01:15:51;01:15:53;"On the run, on the go."
01:15:53;01:15:56;"Like, it would go so perfect with the new Diet Coke campaign."
01:15:56;01:15:57;"Oh yeah, dude."
01:15:57;01:15:59;"The only reason they probably didn't do it is because I'm sure they used it before."
01:15:59;01:16:00;"Right."
01:16:00;01:16:02;"Like, Cindy Crawford pounding a Diet Coke."
01:16:02;01:16:13;"*music*"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"You could drive a different car."
01:16:15;01:16:17;"But why would you?"
01:16:17;01:16:22;"*music*"
01:16:22;01:16:25;"The new beer-battered shrimp at Long John Silver's."
01:16:25;01:16:31;"*laughing*"
01:16:31;01:16:36;"*music*"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"Curbside pickup at Applebee's."
01:16:38;01:16:41;"*laughing*"
01:16:41;01:16:49;"*music*"
01:16:49;01:16:52;"Lonnie, tell your dad the McRib is back."
01:16:52;01:16:53;"*laughing*"
01:16:53;01:16:55;"Plug in that chest freezer."
01:16:55;01:16:56;"*laughing*"
01:16:56;01:16:57;"Dope song, though."
01:16:57;01:16:58;"It's a great song."
01:16:58;01:17:10;"*music*"
01:17:10;01:17:11;"Hockey."
01:17:11;01:17:13;"Maple syrup."
01:17:13;01:17:15;"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau."
01:17:15;01:17:16;"Here we go."
01:17:16;01:17:19;"All these things make us Canadian."
01:17:19;01:17:21;"But what really makes us Canadian..."
01:17:21;01:17:23;"is sweet chili heat Doritos."
01:17:23;01:17:25;"*laughing*"
01:17:25;01:17:27;"The slightly differently..."
01:17:27;01:17:29;"*laughing*"
01:17:29;01:17:32;"The American Doritos with a slightly different name."
01:17:32;01:17:34;"Pick up a pack."
01:17:34;01:17:40;"*music*"
01:17:40;01:17:41;"Good song."
01:17:41;01:17:43;"Let's see how 2018 competes."
01:17:43;01:17:44;"Christine Aguilera. Oh."
01:17:44;01:17:45;"Oh."
01:17:45;01:17:46;"It's been a while."
01:17:46;01:17:47;"She's doing a comeback."
01:17:47;01:17:48;"Hello, old friend."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"*laughing*"
01:17:49;01:17:50;"Bam."
01:17:50;01:17:52;"This is from her album called Liberation."
01:17:52;01:17:53;"New record."
01:17:54;01:17:55;"Is it out yet?"
01:17:55;01:17:57;"Uh, no. I think this is the first single, actually."
01:17:57;01:17:59;"And it's featuring Demi Lovato."
01:17:59;01:18:06;"*music*"
01:18:06;01:18:07;"Have you heard this yet?"
01:18:07;01:18:08;"Either of you guys?"
01:18:08;01:18:09;"No."
01:18:09;01:18:10;"Any of you?"
01:18:10;01:18:14;"Wait, first, I just gotta say, how hilarious is it that, like, in 2018 you hear that and you're like,"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"""Okay. Alright, I see what you're doing."""
01:18:16;01:18:17;"*laughing*"
01:18:17;01:18:19;"It's like, ""Okay."""
01:18:19;01:18:22;"That sounds like a 30-something pop star launching a comeback."
01:18:22;01:18:25;"Whereas, like, imagine you just, like, played this for somebody in 1969."
01:18:25;01:18:26;"*music*"
01:18:26;01:18:30;"You're like, ""What the f*** is this?"""
01:18:30;01:18:31;"*laughing*"
01:18:31;01:18:35;"And we're just like, ""Okay. Uh-huh. Right. I get it."""
01:18:35;01:18:43;"*music*"
01:18:43;01:18:44;"Wow, this is slow."
01:18:44;01:18:47;"*music*"
01:18:47;01:18:48;"She's coming back. It's cool."
01:18:48;01:19:03;"*music*"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"Interesting."
01:19:04;01:19:09;"*music*"
01:19:09;01:19:13;"So some people have been calling this a kind of empowerment anthem for the Me Too era."
01:19:13;01:19:15;"Sure, yeah. Getting that."
01:19:15;01:19:17;"Cautionary tale, kind of."
01:19:17;01:19:44;"*music*"
01:19:44;01:19:45;"Nice."
01:19:45;01:19:55;"*music*"
01:19:55;01:19:57;"I wonder if this will be, like, a hit. It's pretty weird."
01:19:57;01:19:58;"It's real heavy."
01:19:58;01:19:59;"It's heavy and weird."
01:19:59;01:20:01;"I mean, musically and lyrically."
01:20:01;01:20:04;"One thing about Christina Aguilera, hell of a voice."
01:20:04;01:20:05;"Oh, yeah."
01:20:05;01:20:09;"Like, she's not for everybody, but she's undeniably one of the great singers of her era."
01:20:09;01:20:10;"Yeah."
01:20:10;01:20:19;"She was, like, positioned as being part of that wave of, like, the girl bands and the boy bands and the NSYNC, Britney, Jessica Simpson's 98 Degrees."
01:20:19;01:20:21;"That was kind of her era. That TRL era."
01:20:21;01:20:26;"And of all those people, she was the one who was kind of, like, the most technically proficient singer."
01:20:26;01:20:27;"She had chops."
01:20:27;01:20:28;"Yeah, she had--"
01:20:28;01:20:33;"It must have been funny for her to be, like, grouped in with Britney and be like, ""Uh, yeah, I can sing, though."""
01:20:33;01:20:35;"I'm sure she felt that way."
01:20:35;01:20:36;"Yeah, I'm sure."
01:20:36;01:20:37;"""Britney can sing, but Britney--"""
01:20:37;01:20:38;"Not really."
01:20:38;01:20:39;"I mean--"
01:20:39;01:20:41;"Britney does, like, a character."
01:20:41;01:20:45;"She can't do the Christina Aguilera--"
01:20:45;01:20:47;"She's like Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera."
01:20:47;01:20:51;"Yeah, or, like, she can mimic kind of, like, Whitney Houston-style melismatic runs."
01:20:51;01:20:54;"Well, like, Britney couldn't sing this song just straight up."
01:20:54;01:20:57;"I mean, forget about the runs."
01:20:57;01:20:59;"You're throwing the gauntlet down on her?"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"You challenging her to sing that song?"
01:21:01;01:21:04;"Absolutely."
01:21:04;01:21:07;"I mean, I like some of Britney's pop songs."
01:21:07;01:21:08;"They're fun songs."
01:21:08;01:21:09;"Oh, yeah."
01:21:09;01:21:10;"She has a lot of great songs."
01:21:10;01:21:11;"Yeah."
01:21:11;01:21:12;"And she--"
01:21:12;01:21:13;"I mean, I might--"
01:21:13;01:21:16;"In terms of, like, a fun, enjoyable listening experience, I would go Britney over Christina."
01:21:16;01:21:22;"So you prefer Britney's oeuvre, but you think Christina blows her out of the way in terms of technicality?"
01:21:22;01:21:25;"I mean, I don't think that's even an argument that you could counter."
01:21:25;01:21:26;"But, yeah."
01:21:26;01:21:27;"Right, but--"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"I guess the argument would be, like, Britney's songs are more fun."
01:21:29;01:21:32;"Your favorite bands are Pavement and Guided by Voices."
01:21:32;01:21:33;"Yep."
01:21:33;01:21:38;"So you're kind of like Eddie Van Halen can do things technically on the guitar that none of the dudes in these--"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"Those bands can-- sure."
01:21:40;01:21:43;"But you would still-- you prefer them to Van Halen?"
01:21:43;01:21:44;"Yeah."
01:21:44;01:21:45;"That's debatable."
01:21:45;01:21:47;"I like Vampire Weekend, too."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"Oh!"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"Not a lot of chops in that band."
01:21:50;01:21:56;"I've been practicing my skills."

01:21:58;01:22:00;"Oh, now it's 12-minute?"
01:22:00;01:22:01;"What was it, 8-minute?"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"It was 8-minute before."

01:22:04;01:22:05;"I'm wearing the tee."
01:22:05;01:22:07;"8-minute Cape Cod."
01:22:07;01:22:09;"Jake's got one of the new tie-dyes."
01:22:09;01:22:10;"No, but you're right."
01:22:10;01:22:14;"The truth is, I've always valued vibe over technical proficiency."
01:22:14;01:22:15;"Sure."
01:22:15;01:22:16;"It's gotten me this far."
01:22:16;01:22:23;"But as I get older, as you get older and, like, the vibe wears off, I do start to admire just, like, Shredder--"
01:22:23;01:22:24;"Cold technicians."
01:22:24;01:22:27;"I do start to-- I kind of do."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"Like, I agree."
01:22:28;01:22:29;"Like, I generally go for vibe."
01:22:29;01:22:32;"And Britney also, I've connected with more of her songs."
01:22:32;01:22:39;"And she actually has-- she's written some-- one thing about Britney, she's not one of the pop stars who forces her name onto things she didn't write."
01:22:39;01:22:41;"I've always heard that about her from people who worked with her."
01:22:41;01:22:45;"But she actually has written on some songs, including this one song called ""Every Time."""
01:22:45;01:22:46;"It's really beautiful."
01:22:46;01:22:48;"And she actually wrote that song herself."
01:22:48;01:22:49;"Tight."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"Don't know it."
01:22:50;01:22:53;"I think also as you get older, like, binaries become less important."
01:22:53;01:22:54;"Absolutely."

01:23:00;01:23:03;"And then you get older and you're like, ""It really takes all kinds."""

01:51:35;01:51:39;"whatever, like, little feelings people have in the moment"
01:51:39;01:51:42;"when our children take over ""Time Crisis"""
01:51:42;01:51:44;"and they're doing this in 50 years"
01:51:44;01:51:47;"and they look back, they'll find it interesting"
01:51:47;01:51:50;"that ""This is America"" was, like, number one in 2018."
01:51:50;01:51:53;"They won't have any of the, like, tiny little aesthetic things"
01:51:53;01:51:56;"that people have when talking about art in, like, the--"
01:51:56;01:51:58;"- Narcissism of small differences."
01:51:58;01:51:59;"- Narcissism of small differences."
01:51:59;01:52:02;"- I love to think about Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground"
01:52:02;01:52:05;"going to see a performance of ""Hair."""
01:52:05;01:52:06;"- Oh, they probably wouldn't."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"- In New York in '69."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"- Remember-- - Maybe they did--"
01:52:09;01:52:12;"Someone's dad is, like, a weird, like, manager of, like,"
01:52:12;01:52:13;"the actual, you know, like, theater people."
01:52:13;01:52:14;"- Yeah, they're probably, like, all fucked up,"
01:52:14;01:52:16;"just being like, ""What the fuck is this?"""
01:52:16;01:52:17;"- Yeah, they're-- - It sucks."
01:52:17;01:52:20;"Remember when, like, I sent you that article I found once"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"on, like, some deep Grateful Dead website about how--"
01:52:22;01:52:23;"- Oh, yeah, dude."
01:52:23;01:52:24;"- About how the Velvet Underground"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"was always really snooty to the dead."
01:52:26;01:52:27;"- But then they played a show together?"
01:52:27;01:52:28;"- They played a few times together."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"- In San Francisco."
01:52:29;01:52:31;"- And apparently there was this weird competition"
01:52:31;01:52:33;"about who was gonna play longer, and then even--"
01:52:33;01:52:35;"so they knew each other a little bit,"
01:52:35;01:52:36;"and then even afterwards--"
01:52:36;01:52:37;"- So deep."
01:52:37;01:52:38;"- Lou Reed in the early '70s--"
01:52:38;01:52:40;"yeah, they would do these interviews where they'd be like,"
01:52:40;01:52:41;"""What do you think about, like, the San Francisco--"
01:52:41;01:52:43;"""Oh, the Grateful Dead."""
01:52:43;01:52:44;"And there was a hilarious--"
01:52:44;01:52:47;"it was, like, kind of deep into the '70s or something."
01:52:47;01:52:48;"Lou Reed did an interview where they're like,"
01:52:48;01:52:49;"""What do you think about the Grateful Dead?"""
01:52:49;01:52:52;"And he's like, ""Jerry's not even that good of a guitarist."""
01:52:52;01:52:53;"- He's just playing the same solo over and over again."
01:52:53;01:52:54;"- He played the same thing over and over again."
01:52:54;01:52:55;"It's like-- - Get out of here."
01:52:55;01:52:57;"- Looking back in retrospect, it's like,"
01:52:57;01:53:00;"""Yo, Lou Reed's a legend, but come on, man."
01:53:00;01:53:03;"""Jerry's not good at guitar. Shut the fuck up."""
01:53:03;01:53:04;"[laughter]"
01:53:04;01:53:07;"But again-- - Just give it up, man."
01:53:07;01:53:09;"- Back then, probably the difference"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"in the way the Velvet Underground saw themselves"
01:53:11;01:53:13;"from the Grateful Dead was very important."
01:53:13;01:53:16;"- The irony is they're both doing heroin."
01:53:16;01:53:17;"- Right."
01:53:17;01:53:18;"- Just hang out, guys."
01:53:18;01:53:21;"- You guys have a lot more in common than you don't."
01:53:21;01:53:25;"Seinfeld, you wanted to speak about something."
01:53:25;01:53:27;"Hey, by the way, how are the Twitter numbers doing?"
01:53:27;01:53:29;"- Oh, they got way up. - Are they?"
01:53:29;01:53:30;"- Yeah, you'll be pleasantly surprised."
01:53:30;01:53:32;"- Are we over 10K? - We are. We're over 11K."
01:53:32;01:53:34;"- Seriously? - Congratulations, guys."
01:53:34;01:53:36;"- Where am I? - I'm still under 3K."
01:53:36;01:53:38;"- Wait, wait, wait. - You read your own account."
01:53:38;01:53:40;"- Is it really at 11K? - Yeah, take a look."
01:53:40;01:53:42;"- Did you buy them?"
01:53:42;01:53:44;"- Look, I don't want to-- [laughter]"
01:53:44;01:53:47;"I don't want to speak to the provenance of the followers."
01:53:47;01:53:49;"We're at exactly 11K."
01:53:49;01:53:51;"- I don't want to dredge up the past."
01:53:51;01:53:53;"Should we be-- do we need, like,"
01:53:53;01:53:54;"a Facebook page or something?"
01:53:54;01:53:56;"- I mean, in 2018?"
01:53:56;01:53:58;"- Oh, yeah, Facebook's-- - It's a bad look."
01:53:58;01:53:59;"- I don't know, yeah."
01:53:59;01:54:02;"- But Twitter still feels, like, kind of dead."
01:54:02;01:54:04;"What do we-- - I think Twitter's back."
01:54:04;01:54:06;"- Oh, do we need a musical.ly?"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"What's it called, musically?"
01:54:08;01:54:10;"- I think we need a Bandcamp. - Do we need a Bandcamp?"
01:54:10;01:54:13;"- Is Vampire Weekend on Bandcamp?"
01:54:13;01:54:14;"- No. - Okay."
01:54:14;01:54:16;"- I think we need an Amazon Prime account..."
01:54:16;01:54:17;"[laughter]"
01:54:17;01:54:19;"to buy paper towels and stuff."
01:54:19;01:54:20;"[laughter]"
01:54:20;01:54:23;"- I think we need a Hulu Plus account."
01:54:23;01:54:26;"Oh, yeah, yeah, so this whole show,"
01:54:26;01:54:28;"Jake has been wearing this absolutely beautiful"
01:54:28;01:54:30;"psychedelic tie-dyed... - Gorgeous."
01:54:30;01:54:32;"- 8-minute Cape Cod shirt."
01:54:32;01:54:33;"- It's gonna be on the Twitter account."
01:54:33;01:54:34;"- That's right."
01:54:34;01:54:37;"Go to the Twitter account @TimeCrisis2000."
01:54:37;01:54:38;"You can find out more information"
01:54:38;01:54:40;"about how you can get one."
01:54:40;01:54:42;"- Cool, well, they really are gorgeous shirts."
01:54:42;01:54:43;"Well done, Seinfeld, and I'm proud of you"
01:54:43;01:54:47;"for getting the Twitter account over 11K."
01:54:47;01:54:48;"- Thanks so much."
01:54:48;01:54:50;"- I'm still well under 3K."
01:54:50;01:54:52;"- Well under 3K? - Yeah."
01:54:52;01:54:55;"- Everybody follow Jake @DongStreth."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"- Thank you, Seinfeld."
01:54:57;01:54:59;"- Not DongStretch."
01:54:59;01:55:01;"- Nope, not DongStretch."
01:55:01;01:55:08;"[laughter]"
01:55:08;01:55:10;"- All right, well, that was a hell of a show."
01:55:10;01:55:11;"Thanks to Baio."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"Thanks for letting us debut"
01:55:12;01:55:15;"your Sting and Shaggy remix on the program."
01:55:15;01:55:19;"Thank you to Phil Matariz for calling in"
01:55:19;01:55:21;"and talking Doritos with us,"
01:55:21;01:55:26;"and no thank you to the Tic Tac Company"
01:55:26;01:55:29;"for lying to the American public."
01:55:29;01:55:31;"And if anybody from Tic Tac wants to call in"
01:55:31;01:55:35;"and defend it, we will respectfully have you on the show."
01:55:35;01:55:36;"And please hit us with some Tic Tac emails."
01:55:36;01:55:38;"And also, I just want to say one last thing."
01:55:38;01:55:39;"We've got a lot of great emails"
01:55:39;01:55:42;"about Alanis Morissette and her musical,"
01:55:42;01:55:46;"and we will be talking about that in two weeks."
01:55:46;01:55:47;"As always, finger on the pulse."
01:55:47;01:55:49;"Time Crisis."
01:55:49;01:55:51;"[laughter]"
01:55:51;01:55:55;"- ""Time Crisis"" with Ezra King."
