00:00;00:07;"Time crisis returns, and this time, we've got Olympics fever,"
00:07;00:11;"as the Olympics rage down in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."
00:11;00:16;"Jake and I talk about the effect it has on the American psyche."
00:16;00:20;"We also highlight other aspects of health and fitness."
00:20;00:24;"We revisit the music of 1984."
00:24;00:28;"We'll hear a lot of great tracks from the Olympic host country, Brazil."
00:28;00:30;"This is..."
00:30;00:34;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:34;00:38;"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:38;00:43;"I said goodbye, all of those great romances"
00:43;00:47;"They were a felt wobbly leap"
00:47;00:50;"Of my rightful chances"
00:50;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:58;01:01;"And so I dealt you the blow"
01:01;01:05;"When the bus had to go"
01:05;01:09;"How it's different, I want you to know"
01:09;01:12;"One of us is crying"
01:12;01:15;"One of us is lying"
01:15;01:20;"Even only there"
01:20;01:25;"Staring at the ceiling"
01:25;01:29;"Wishing she was somewhere else instead"
01:29;01:31;"Mmm, hear that Jake?"
01:31;01:32;"Yep."
01:32;01:34;"I'm eating some Cracker Jacks."
01:34;01:35;"And Doritos?"
01:35;01:39;"Not Doritos, because I feel like in the past few shows,"
01:39;01:42;"I really hit a wall around the 90 minute mark."
01:42;01:43;"Yep."
01:43;01:45;"And I need to eat some Doritos, but I want to start off with some Cracker Jacks."
01:45;01:47;"And also just had an idea."
01:47;01:50;"We knew we were going to talk about the Olympics on Today's Time Crisis,"
01:50;01:54;"because the Olympics are going on, everybody's got Olympics fever."
01:54;01:57;"I think we should make the entire show about sports."
01:57;01:58;"Great."
01:58;01:59;"So this is a sports show."
01:59;02:00;"Okay."
02:00;02:02;"For me, I include sports, health, and fitness."
02:02;02:03;"Sure."
02:03;02:04;"I just went camping."
02:04;02:05;"That's right."
02:05;02:06;"Is that considered a sport?"
02:06;02:07;"No."
02:07;02:08;"What is it?"
02:08;02:09;"An activity?"
02:09;02:11;"Yeah, it's a leisure activity."
02:11;02:12;"Hiking is a sport."
02:12;02:14;"Yeah, it's athletic, it's not a sport."
02:14;02:15;"Yeah, whatever, it's health and fitness."
02:15;02:16;"Okay."
02:16;02:18;"I've always been curious about this, because as long as I've known you,"
02:18;02:20;"you've really been into the great outdoors."
02:20;02:21;"Uh-huh."
02:21;02:24;"And I've been mocked mercilessly."
02:24;02:27;"I've always had friends who were more into the great outdoors than me."
02:27;02:28;"Yeah."
02:28;02:30;"Even going back to childhood."
02:30;02:33;"I remember my friend Andre growing up, his family was also really into camping."
02:33;02:36;"And any time I would end up in the wilderness with him,"
02:36;02:39;"I'd always complain a lot, and he would always call me a suburban slicker."
02:39;02:40;"Yep."
02:40;02:43;"My dad supposedly doesn't even know how to swim."
02:43;02:44;"Whoa."
02:44;02:46;"Not a very outdoorsy family."
02:46;02:48;"So I've always felt a little disconnected from the great outdoors."
02:48;02:53;"So for listeners like me who maybe have never been to the woods,"
02:53;02:57;"don't enjoy the majesty of nature, what's it all about?"
02:57;03:01;"It's dealing with hardship in order to get a reward."
03:01;03:06;"And so if you have to, like, hike for eight miles with a lot of weight on your back,"
03:06;03:10;"and then you finally get to the awesome spot that isn't accessible by car,"
03:10;03:15;"you make a campfire, you're with your friends, everything is just, like, heightened."
03:15;03:19;"Right, so because you're getting that Instagram picture that nobody else got."
03:19;03:21;"Well, in this day, that is an added bonus."
03:21;03:22;"You're not wrong."
03:22;03:24;"Right, because everybody and their mother comes to L.A."
03:24;03:27;"and stands in front of the street lights in front of LACMA,"
03:27;03:32;"but you're going three to four hours out of your way to some weird clearing up a mountain,"
03:32;03:36;"and then when you geotag it, you're going to be one of the only pictures."
03:36;03:40;"I think this is a very cynical way to look at it."
03:40;03:47;"I think people that really enjoy hiking and camping find that there is some sort of internal--"
03:47;03:49;"I almost want to say spiritual reward--"
03:49;03:50;"You can say it."
03:50;03:51;"--that comes with it."
03:51;03:53;"The time crisis has been getting more and more spiritual."
03:53;03:55;"It's a spiritual safe space."
03:55;03:59;"You could travel to a foreign city and experience something completely other than yourself,"
03:59;04:06;"or you could go in the middle of nowhere and spend a day by yourself in the desert around no one"
04:06;04:08;"and find some other perspective."
04:08;04:13;"I totally understand the concept of, like, putting yourself through hardship for reward."
04:13;04:14;"Right."
04:14;04:18;"But there's got to be something, because every day here in L.A.,"
04:18;04:23;"you've got people who are just--they don't want to pound out the last 10 reps,"
04:23;04:26;"and their trainer says, ""Do it,"" and they just pound through."
04:26;04:28;"They feel amazing afterwards."
04:28;04:31;"They're sweating, experiencing physical pain."
04:31;04:32;"Yeah."
04:32;04:33;"They want to quit."
04:33;04:34;"Trainer won't let them."
04:34;04:37;"And then at the end, they get that endorphin rush of, like,"
04:37;04:40;"""I just completed a crazy hour-long workout."""
04:40;04:45;"So my question is--but of course that's probably going to be happening at, like, an equinox."
04:45;04:47;"So is it just the setting thing?"
04:47;04:52;"I think you're putting it into too narrow a lens of achievement"
04:52;04:55;"and, like, these capitalistic terms."
04:55;04:56;"Man."
04:56;04:57;"All right, man."
04:57;04:59;"It's more open and vague."
04:59;05:01;"It's about the journey, not the destination."
05:01;05:03;"Sometimes you go camping, and it sucks."
05:03;05:05;"I went two years ago with my brother."
05:05;05:09;"We met our parents up at 10,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada."
05:09;05:13;"Incredible spot, but it was a weird day or two, and it was really cold at night."
05:13;05:15;"It was down into the 20s."
05:15;05:20;"We didn't pack quite right for those conditions, and then the next day it started pouring rain."
05:20;05:21;"Oh, God."
05:21;05:26;"And so it was, like, 40 degrees at 8:30 in the morning, and it's pouring, and we're wet."
05:26;05:27;"We're trying to make coffee."
05:27;05:30;"And we were like, ""Yeah, this kind of sucks."""
05:30;05:32;"It makes it for a good story later on--"
05:32;05:33;"At the time it sucked."
05:33;05:36;"--to, like, kind of reminisce with your family later in the year,"
05:36;05:40;"but it could have gone the other way too where it was just, like, perfect conditions."
05:40;05:43;"Like this last week when I was out, it was great."
05:43;05:44;"The weather was beautiful."
05:44;05:51;"If you're walking eight miles out in a state park, are you talking to the people you're with?"
05:51;05:52;"You've never done this?"
05:52;05:53;"Do you have headphones on?"
05:53;05:54;"I'm going to take you out."
05:54;05:55;"Dude, I'm going to take you out."
05:55;05:58;"I mean, I went hiking with you in Griffith Park."
05:58;06:00;"That's not hiking, dude."
06:00;06:04;"In fact, we're going to do a off-mic time crisis."
06:04;06:07;"Out in Joshua Tree or wherever you want to go."
06:07;06:12;"If a time crisis happens in Joshua Tree with no recording equipment, did it happen?"
06:12;06:13;"No, it didn't."
06:13;06:14;"Did you post a picture of the Instagram?"
06:14;06:17;"No, but seriously, you're hiking, say, like, with a couple people."
06:17;06:18;"Yeah."
06:18;06:19;"Are you talking?"
06:19;06:20;"Sometimes."
06:20;06:23;"Is it considered rude to put in earbuds and cranks for tunes?"
06:23;06:24;"That would be weird."
06:25;06:26;"Why?"
06:26;06:30;"You're just throwing on, like, Bee Gees' ""Greatest Hits."""
06:30;06:31;"Okay, here's a question."
06:31;06:32;"That's a little tacky."
06:32;06:35;"I mean, you could pull it off, but it'd be a little, like, slightly alienating."
06:35;06:42;"Now that everybody has these, like, Bluetooth little speaker boxes, little jam boxes or whatever,"
06:42;06:46;"do you find more that you'll see some people coming down the trail"
06:46;06:50;"and they're just, like, blasting some tunes from their rucksack?"
06:50;06:51;"You'll see that."
06:51;06:53;"Okay, so it's more considered rude with the earbuds."
06:53;06:57;"I mean, if I passed someone I didn't know with earbuds, it wouldn't bum me out."
06:57;07:00;"But if I was out with my brother or my girlfriend or something"
07:00;07:03;"and they just, like, popped in earbuds and were like, ""Peace,"""
07:03;07:05;"that'd be kind of weird."
07:05;07:07;"Not as weird as if somebody did that at, like, dinner."
07:07;07:08;"True."
07:08;07:10;"Not as weird, but borderline."
07:10;07:14;"I'm just saying because at dinner you're, like, facing each other."
07:14;07:17;"But walking is a very specific head space."
07:17;07:18;"You know what I mean?"
07:18;07:22;"Sometimes great conversations can be facilitated through walking."
08:10;08:13;"Thanks for talking to us about camping."
08:13;08:16;"Let's move more into what are considered, like, true sports."
08:16;08:17;"Yeah."
08:17;08:21;"I did say with an asterisk, this is sports, parentheses health and fitness."
08:21;08:23;"So that definitely falls under health and fitness."
08:23;08:25;"You can imagine a doctor being like, ""You should hike more."""
08:25;08:26;"Right. Oh, yeah, sure."
08:26;08:29;"Get those steps in, get in the outdoors."
08:29;08:31;"But so everybody has Olympics fever."
08:31;08:33;"So since you've been off the grid a little bit--"
08:33;08:34;"Very."
08:34;08:37;"--up in the Sierra Nevadas, like, what was the talk of the trail?"
08:37;08:39;"Was there Olympics talk on the trail?"
08:39;08:40;"Zero."
08:40;08:41;"Zero?"
08:41;08:42;"Yep."
08:42;08:43;"Just because phone service is so bad,"
08:43;08:45;"people just didn't even know what was happening in the Olympics?"
08:45;08:48;"People knew it was happening, but it just didn't come up."
08:48;08:49;"That seems like perfect trail talk."
08:49;08:51;"What? Okay."
08:51;08:56;"Reenact for me what you think Olympic trail talk would be."
08:56;08:58;"Hey, Jake, you know the Olympics are going on now."
08:58;08:59;"Yeah, I heard that."
08:59;09:00;"Where are they this year?"
09:00;09:01;"Rio?"
09:01;09:03;"That's right. What country is Rio in?"
09:03;09:04;"I think Brazil."
09:04;09:05;"Interesting."
09:05;09:10;"What events are you excited to view or find out about?"
09:10;09:11;"Honestly, none of them."
09:11;09:12;"Really?"
09:12;09:13;"Yeah."
09:13;09:15;"Let's just take this conversation back into real life."
09:15;09:16;"Do you know who Michael Phelps is?"
09:16;09:18;"Yeah, he's a swimmer, smokes weed."
09:18;09:19;"That's right."
09:19;09:23;"He's won more gold medals than anyone in history."
09:23;09:24;"Really? I did not know that."
09:24;09:25;"Yeah."
09:25;09:26;"That's cool."
09:26;09:27;"Yeah, it's because you were up in the Sierra Nevadas."
09:27;09:29;"So he's killing it this summer?"
09:29;09:32;"Yeah, I think he broke the record at this current Olympics."
09:32;09:35;"For gold medals or for a time of some event?"
09:35;09:37;"Maybe both, but specifically medals."
09:37;09:38;"Okay."
09:38;09:41;"I felt like this Olympics really had a dark cloud hanging over it."
09:41;09:43;"I mean, this is good trail talk."
09:43;09:45;"I'm just saying, just to loop back."
09:45;09:46;"Yeah, let's just pretend we're hiking."
09:46;09:47;"Yeah."
09:47;09:50;"This Olympics really had a dark cloud hanging over it, man."
09:50;09:57;"From Zika to the socioeconomic implications of where they built the stadiums."
09:57;09:59;"Russian doping scandal."
09:59;10:00;"Russian doping scandal."
10:00;10:03;"The coverage on this Olympics has been very negative."
10:03;10:04;"You know what's funny, though?"
10:04;10:06;"This is like the pessimistic view."
10:06;10:12;"It's always been kind of like a conspiracy theory that the Illuminati or whatever you want to call them,"
10:12;10:15;"you know, like the old phrase, ""Religion is the opiate of the masses,"""
10:15;10:20;"that sports is used in a similar way to kind of stir patriotism in us"
10:20;10:23;"or make us forget about other things going on."
10:23;10:26;"And it really seemed like with this Olympics, people were talking so negatively about it."
10:26;10:29;"I was like, ""Man, people are not going to be into this Olympics."""
10:29;10:33;"But then once it starts, people do get kind of into it, and they get psyched that America wins."
10:33;10:34;"They do?"
10:34;10:35;"Yeah."
10:35;10:36;"Are you?"
10:36;10:38;"You know, I haven't watched that much of it."
10:38;10:40;"It's a weird one."
10:40;10:43;"I guess I felt good when Michael Phelps won."
10:43;10:44;"You felt good?"
10:44;10:46;"Made my day."
10:46;10:47;"No, it didn't."
10:47;10:50;"You didn't think about it 40 seconds after the event happened."
10:50;10:52;"Well, you know what's also funny?"
10:52;10:55;"With other sports, you need to grow up watching them to understand them."
10:55;11:00;"In the Olympics, they show like a three-minute explainer that gives you some of the backstage drama,"
11:00;11:02;"and suddenly you're in."
11:02;11:04;"It's like they have three minutes to make you care about swimming."
11:04;11:05;"Right, right, right."
11:05;11:10;"So I was watching it, and they were like, ""There's a South African guy named Leclo."""
11:10;11:12;"I forget what his first name is."
11:12;11:16;"But basically, he was like Michael Phelps' main rival."
11:16;11:19;"And at some point in the past few years, Michael Phelps had said like,"
11:19;11:22;"""Oh, yeah, I watched the young crop compete in the butterfly."""
11:22;11:25;"They're all pretty slow, and this guy's really offended."
11:25;11:28;"And then he said something like, ""Get back in the pool. I'll whoop your ass."""
11:28;11:30;"And Michael Phelps is like, ""I'm in."""
11:30;11:34;"And they kept showing this footage of them in the green room, like getting ready."
11:34;11:35;"Holding chairs."
11:35;11:39;"Yeah, and Phelps has this hood on, just like, ""Earbuds in."""
11:39;11:40;"Oh, man."
11:40;11:41;"Earbuds firmly in."
11:41;11:42;"Like a boxer."
11:42;11:44;"Yeah, definitely probably playing M&M, getting in the game."
11:44;11:47;"And then this guy's like standing up, almost like showboating."
11:47;11:49;"And then they get in the pool."
11:49;11:55;"By that point, NBC Sports has kind of made you want Michael Phelps to win."
11:55;11:56;"Right."
11:56;11:57;"Also, yeah, I don't know."
11:57;11:59;"Maybe it's just like pure xenophobia."
11:59;12:01;"You hear like this guy with the South African accent"
12:01;12:05;"talking to one of the greatest swimmers of all time."
12:05;12:06;"And this is probably his last Olympics."
12:06;12:08;"You want to see him beat him."
12:08;12:11;"So I guess when he won, I was kind of like, ""Nice."""
12:11;12:14;"To me, think about when the Olympics started."
12:14;12:19;"It was a really novel concept to get all these countries from around the world,"
12:19;12:22;"from these disparate cultures, to get together to compete."
12:22;12:26;"But now it's like a cliche that we live in this globalized world."
12:26;12:29;"Travel and technology is so easy."
12:29;12:35;"It doesn't have the same profound resonance that I think it might have at one point."
12:35;12:39;"And to me, it's sort of like, ""All right, yeah, these countries are getting together to compete."
12:39;12:43;"Maybe someone's going to shave a fraction of a second off the world record."
12:43;12:48;"Are the athletes today that break the records fundamentally better athletes"
12:48;12:50;"than the athletes of the past?"""
12:50;12:51;"I don't think so."
12:51;12:56;"I think they're probably more just like vessels of whatever nutrition and technological advances"
12:56;12:59;"are happening in training in their era."
12:59;13:01;"It's hard to get excited about it for me."
13:01;13:04;"It's not a compelling human narrative that you live in 2016."
13:04;13:05;"You have a badass trainer."
13:05;13:09;"You have the grim determination that all these other athletes have,"
13:09;13:12;"or the same grim determination that athletes had 80 years ago."
13:12;13:15;"You're drinking kale shakes, taking crazy vitamins."
13:15;13:19;"You have weird metrics that are measuring your blood and heart."
13:19;13:23;"Sports are merging with science in a way that is not interesting to me."
13:23;13:25;"I know what you meant."
13:25;13:26;"There was a turning point."
13:26;13:29;"It's interesting to think back in the day, the early Olympic athletes,"
13:29;13:31;"they had no idea what they were doing."
13:31;13:32;"I guess they had trainers and stuff."
13:32;13:33;"It was like Chariots of Fire."
13:33;13:35;"These guys would run around on the beach."
13:35;13:36;"A lot of athletes wore sweaters."
13:36;13:38;"They didn't even have special clothes or anything."
13:38;13:41;"Every now and then there's a charismatic story,"
13:41;13:44;"or a charismatic athlete with a compelling back story."
13:44;13:46;"You always got to root for the hard knock story."
13:46;13:48;"Yeah, like the refugee team."
13:48;13:49;"You know what's a crazy Olympics?"
13:49;13:53;"I caught just the tail end of a story about it on the radio this morning."
13:53;13:57;"It was the '36 one, which was the Nazi one,"
13:57;13:59;"when Hitler had just taken power."
13:59;14:01;"And he wouldn't shake Jesse Owens' hand."
14:01;14:07;"Yeah, and there were 18 black athletes from the U.S. that went over and competed."
14:07;14:11;"And then like three years later, he invades Poland."
14:11;14:12;"Can you imagine?"
14:12;14:14;"That seems like a really crazy one to me."
14:14;14:16;"I kind of want to read more about that."
15:35;15:37;"Well, you know what, man?"
15:37;15:42;"Like, sure, science has had a big impact on modern sportsmanship."
15:42;15:46;"But that only makes it more interesting, in my humble opinion."
15:46;15:49;"And I think it's really important, as Americans,"
15:49;15:53;"we got our guys and gals competing down there in Brazil."
15:53;15:58;"And I think it's really important that we get psyched about the Olympics."
15:58;16:00;"Do you think it's possible that you can get psyched?"
16:00;16:02;"I'm psyched about NBC's ad revenue."
16:02;16:04;"NBC's going to be raking it in."
16:04;16:06;"And you know who owns NBC?"
16:06;16:09;"Do you know how many stories I've heard about NBC and, like,"
16:09;16:13;"the contract they signed that locked down the rights until 2024,"
16:13;16:16;"and then they've only secured this amount of ad revenue?"
16:16;16:18;"It's just like, are you kidding me?"
16:18;16:20;"NBC apparently has been pretty harsh."
16:20;16:23;"And they won't let, like, other channels, like,"
16:23;16:25;"use footage of the Olympics or something."
16:25;16:26;"Right."
16:26;16:28;"But you know what? I get it."
16:28;16:31;"Protect your content, NBC."
16:31;16:33;"I'm with it. Good for you."
16:33;16:34;"Pro-NBC."
16:34;16:36;"The Olympics aren't some--"
16:36;16:37;"They're there to make money, man."
16:37;16:38;"Yeah, what do you think the Olympics are?"
16:38;16:41;"Some, like, giant feel-good international thing"
16:41;16:43;"bringing humanity together? Of course not."
16:43;16:46;"It's content owned by General Electric."
16:46;16:47;"But anyway--"
16:47;16:48;"Hallelujah."
16:48;16:50;"I want to get you psyched on the Olympics, man,"
16:50;16:53;"because you've been out there hiking."
16:53;16:55;"And you know what, man? I got to say, like,"
16:55;16:57;"I think it's a little bit offensive that you would choose"
16:57;16:59;"Olympics time to kind of get off the grid,"
16:59;17:01;"because obviously you're not going to have good phone service,"
17:01;17:05;"you're not going to get to watch our guys and gals compete live."
17:05;17:08;"So speaking of the guys and gals competing for us,"
17:08;17:10;"do you know who Ryan Lochte is?"
17:10;17:11;"Nope."
17:11;17:12;"You never heard the name Ryan Lochte?"
17:12;17:13;"Never in my life."
17:13;17:16;"The last name is spelled L-O-C-H-T-E."
17:16;17:18;"Ryan Lochte."
17:18;17:19;"Where's he from?"
17:19;17:21;"Ryan Lochte's from Rochester, New York,"
17:21;17:26;"a hell of a town, home to which major corporations?"
17:26;17:29;"Xerox and formerly Kodak."
17:29;17:31;"You're forgetting one biggie. IBM."
17:31;17:32;"Are they up there?"
17:32;17:33;"Maybe they're not there anymore."
17:33;17:36;"Whatever, Rochester's produced a lot of great American talent,"
17:36;17:40;"whether Ryan Lochte or Xerox."
17:40;17:42;"So anyway, Ryan Lochte's a swimmer."
17:42;17:44;"He's not quite like a Phelps."
17:44;17:46;"He's like almost a Phelps."
17:46;17:50;"He's like the Joe Perry to Phelps' Steven Tyler."
17:50;17:52;"Okay. Younger generation?"
17:52;17:57;"I think he's a tiny bit younger, and also his catchphrase is ""ch-yeah."""
17:57;17:58;"What's that?"
17:58;18:00;"His catchphrase is ""ch-yeah."" Does that sound right?"
18:00;18:01;"How do you spell that?"
18:01;18:03;"Maybe it's more like ""ch-yeah!"""
18:03;18:06;"Is that like after he finishes the race,"
18:06;18:09;"he hits the tile on the pool and he comes up, ""ch-yeah!"""
18:09;18:10;"Or is it like--"
18:10;18:13;"I think--I don't know. Yeltsin used to have a reality show."
18:13;18:14;"He did?"
18:14;18:16;"Yeah, briefly, on E."
18:16;18:17;"That's deep."
18:17;18:19;"Because he wanted to show people he's not just a swimmer."
18:19;18:22;"He's pivoting, dude. He's looking towards the future."
18:22;18:25;"Yeah, I mean, exactly. I can relate to it."
18:25;18:30;"It's like this show is like my version of Ryan Lochte's reality show."
18:30;18:32;"You're trying to get your media career going."
18:32;18:35;"That's right, just showing people, ""Man, it's not all about music."
18:35;18:37;"It's also about--"""
18:37;18:38;"Semi-witty banter."
18:38;18:40;"Semi-witty banter."
18:40;18:43;"So anyway, Ryan Lochte, he's a name you should definitely know."
18:43;18:46;"He's a swimming celebrity,"
18:46;18:50;"and he's down there in Rio fighting for your freedom,"
18:50;18:54;"and we got our hands on his pump-up mix."
18:54;18:55;"Okay."
18:55;18:58;"So we found out the five songs he likes to listen to"
18:58;19:01;"when he's getting ready to jump in the pool"
19:01;19:03;"and swim as hard and fast as he can."
19:03;19:05;"So we put together a little mega mix."
19:05;19:06;"Earbuds in."
19:06;19:08;"Get those earbuds in."
19:08;19:09;"Hoodie on."
19:09;19:11;"If you're sitting at home listening to Time Crisis,"
19:11;19:14;"you got the family gathered around the stereo system,"
19:14;19:16;"everybody, throw it on your phone,"
19:16;19:18;"get those earbuds in, start jogging around the block,"
19:18;19:20;"'cause you're gonna get pumped up."
19:20;19:22;"This is Ryan Lochte's pump-up mix."
19:22;19:23;"Oh, man."
19:23;19:25;"Oh, man. Oh, man."
19:25;19:27;"Yeah, boy."
19:27;19:30;"Not again."
19:30;19:32;"Yeah, I learned a game from William Wesley."
19:32;19:34;"You can never check me."
19:34;19:37;"Back to back for the n---- that didn't get the message."
19:37;19:40;"Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon."
19:40;19:42;"Back to back like I'm Jordan '96, '97."
19:42;19:45;"Ooh, very important and very pretentious."
19:45;19:48;"When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention."
19:48;19:51;"Yeah, but it's weighing heavy on my conscience."
19:51;19:54;"Yeah, and, f---, you left the boy no options."
19:54;19:56;"I wanna see my n---- go insane."
19:56;19:59;"You gon' make me step out of my f---ing frame."
19:59;20:02;"You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne."
20:02;20:04;"You gon' make me go out of my f---ing way."
20:04;20:07;"I waited 4 days, f--- where y'all at?"
20:07;20:09;"I drove here in a Wraith playing ARF."
20:09;20:12;"I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad,"
20:12;20:15;"but I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap."
20:15;20:18;"I mean, ooh, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up."
20:18;20:21;"Second floor, Tussie's getting shoulder rubs."
20:21;20:24;"Miss for y'all to think that I don't write enough."
20:24;20:27;"They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch."
20:27;20:29;"You love her, then you gotta get a world tour."
20:29;20:32;"Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?"
20:32;20:34;"I know that you gotta be a thug for her."
20:34;20:37;"This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more."
20:37;20:40;"Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers."
20:40;20:43;"Yeah, you get embodied by her singing."
20:43;20:46;"I'm not the type of n---- that type of n----."
20:46;20:49;"And shout to all my boss, wife, and n----."
20:49;20:52;"Make sure you hit 'em with the preem'd up."
20:52;20:54;"Then tell that man to ease up."
20:54;20:57;"I did another one, I did another one."
20:57;21:00;"Still ain't said s--- about the other one."
21:00;21:03;"Time Crisis with Ezra Kanin."
21:03;21:06;"Where your ass at, dawg, when it's one feet?"
21:06;21:09;"Where your ass at, dawg, it's 10 deep?"
21:09;21:12;"Where your ass at, dawg, you try to run off?"
21:12;21:15;"Where your ass at, dawg, you made me put this gun off?"
21:15;21:18;"Where your ass at, dawg, you went to switch sides?"
21:18;21:21;"Where your ass at, dawg, when it's spread lies?"

21:27;21:30;"Where your ass at, dawg, when it's just one feet?"
21:30;21:33;"Where your ass at, dawg, it's 10 deep?"
21:33;21:36;"Where your ass at, dawg, you try to run off?"
21:36;21:39;"Where your ass at, dawg, you made me put this gun off?"
21:39;21:42;"Where your ass at, dawg, when I was in the Pirates?"
21:42;21:45;"Where your ass at, dawg, when I was drinking high tech?"
21:45;21:48;"Where your ass at, dawg, came through the project?"
21:48;21:51;"Where your ass at, we came in for the loaded contract?"
21:51;21:54;"We had a ring dance on, we had a jockey."
21:54;21:57;"Running through, like we was going jogging."
21:57;22:00;"The Lord Louis put it in the pocket."
22:00;22:03;"Put a beat with me on the ground, then he popped it."
22:03;22:06;"Where your ass at, when I was traveling in the stroller?"
22:06;22:09;"Had to scroll to get it, when I'm at the cell."
22:09;22:12;"Jack and Chan moves, got the game in the choker."
22:12;22:15;"Gas rolling up in the, I'm a cop 12, trying to come."
22:15;22:18;"In the spot, we know, nothing dope, no."
22:18;22:21;"Got my dog, got my yard, coming."
22:21;22:24;"Turned it out of store, and we still raining, honey."
22:24;22:27;"So blowing on the oil, we calling some, all day."

22:36;22:38;"I'm sipping on you like some fine wine, though."
22:38;22:41;"And when it's over, I press rewind, though."
22:41;22:43;"Hey, we talking bands, girl, I got it."
22:43;22:46;"Benjamin's all in my pocket."

29:07;29:11;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
29:11;29:14;"Filling in for our regular host, Fareed Zachariah."
29:14;29:16;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
29:16;29:17;"Beats."
29:17;29:18;"One."
29:18;29:22;"Yeah, that was Ryan Lochte's pump up mix."
29:22;29:25;"Now you feel a little more hype about the Olympics, Jake?"
29:25;29:26;"Yeah, bro."
29:26;29:31;"I wonder if ""chia"" is like surfers going like ""bruh"" or ""bro"" or ""bra."""
29:31;29:32;"Chia!"
29:32;29:34;"Yeah, it sounds like a surfer kind of thing."
29:34;29:35;"What's up, bru?"
29:35;29:36;"Wait, wait, you call your bra your bru?"
29:36;29:37;"I've heard it."
29:37;29:39;"I don't do it, but I've heard people do it."
29:39;29:40;"What up, bru?"
29:40;29:41;"Oh, I've never heard that."
29:41;29:42;"So what do they call brus?"
29:42;29:43;"Old Kyle Field pushes the slang."
29:43;29:44;"Remember ""buff""?"
29:44;29:45;"Yeah."
29:45;29:46;"Buff."
29:46;29:47;"What is buff?"
29:47;29:49;"To people who don't know, what does buff mean to a surfer?"
29:49;29:51;"Like a rough situation."
29:51;29:53;"Or like, this traffic is buff right now."
29:53;29:54;"Yeah."
29:54;29:56;"Or like, kind of a buffy traff sitch."
29:56;29:57;"Buffy traff sitch?"
29:57;30:01;"Like, dude, I'm running late."
30:01;30:02;"Traffic is buff."
30:02;30:03;"Buffy traff sitch."
30:03;30:07;"How about a buffy trail sitch?"
30:07;30:08;"That can happen, dude."
30:08;30:12;"When I was camping with my parents and it was like 28 degrees and we were freezing, that"
30:12;30:13;"was a buff situation."
30:13;30:16;"Did you just like unzip the tent?"
30:16;30:19;"I was like, ""Dad, this is buff."
30:19;30:23;"Dad, this is a buffy ass sitch, man."""
30:23;30:24;"I was like, ""Jake."""
30:24;30:25;"What the hell, dad?"
30:25;30:28;"""Jake, zip up your north face."
30:28;30:29;"Go to sleep."""
30:29;30:34;"Jake, you're a 37-year-old man."
30:34;30:35;"Pull it together, man."
30:35;30:41;"Oh, we just got some news that Ryan Lochte trademarked his catchphrase."
30:41;30:43;"I think it might be more like ""chia."""
30:43;30:44;"I was saying ""chia."""
30:44;30:46;"But what does it mean?"
30:46;30:48;"I think it's like saying ""yeah."""
30:48;30:54;"It's just like an utterance of pure Howard Dean scream style, just like guttural from"
30:54;30:55;"the soul."
30:55;30:56;"I think it's an affirmation."
30:56;30:58;"It's kind of like, remember Austin Powers?"
30:58;30:59;"Yeah."
30:59;31:00;"Yeah, baby."
31:00;31:02;"So he doesn't say that if he loses."
31:02;31:03;"Or maybe he does."
31:03;31:04;"He probably doesn't know if he loses."
31:04;31:05;"That's the crazy thing about swimming."
31:05;31:07;"You probably don't even know if you win or lose."
31:07;31:09;"When he wins, he says ""chia."""
31:09;31:10;"No."
31:10;31:11;"When he loses, he says ""nya."""
31:11;31:12;"He goes, ""That was a buff."""
31:12;31:15;"That was a buff!"
31:15;31:17;"Yeah!"
31:17;31:22;"So now that we're sufficiently excited about the Olympics, a lot of people don't realize"
31:22;31:26;"how much the Olympics is tied to music."
31:26;31:31;"If you can nail the perfect song to go along with a sporting event that gets people hype,"
31:31;31:35;"reminds them of a glorious time, you've made history."
31:35;31:37;"But every Olympics, people try."
31:37;31:38;"And it doesn't always work out."
31:38;31:43;"The good folks over at USA Today."
31:43;31:48;"You notice how like, I feel like a lot of people started saying ""folks"" post-Obama."
31:48;31:50;"Oh yeah."
31:50;31:51;"I could see that."
31:51;31:56;"I don't know if ""folks"" is more common in different communities, if it's a racial or"
31:56;32:02;"geographic thing, but I just notice people who I never heard say ""folks"" before, who"
32:02;32:08;"never would have said ""folks"" ages later, be like, ""So yeah, I was over at the mall."
32:08;32:10;"There's a bunch of folks getting pretty excited."""
32:10;32:11;"I'm like, ""What?"
32:11;32:12;"Folks?"""
32:12;32:13;"""Folks?"""
32:13;32:14;"I have nothing against the phrase ""folks."""
32:14;32:18;"I just think it's funny just to steal a phrase from the president."
32:18;32:25;"Anyway, the good folks at USA Today put together a list of their top 10 Olympic songs."
32:25;32:31;"And these are songs that are either official Olympic songs, or were co-opted by the Olympics,"
32:31;32:36;"or were maybe commissioned by a corporation that had major ties to the Olympics."
32:36;32:39;"One way or another, these songs are connected to the Olympics."
32:39;32:41;"You ready to count them down?"
32:41;32:42;"Yeah."
32:42;32:45;"Hopefully we'll learn a little bit about Olympics history in the process."
32:45;32:51;"The number 10 song that USA Today chose is called ""Survival"" by the band Muse."
32:51;32:54;"Are you familiar with Muse?"
32:54;32:55;"Vaguely."
32:55;32:57;"They're a hard rockin' UK outfit."
32:57;32:59;"Kind of like a Radiohead ripoff?"
32:59;33:01;"Strong words, my friend."
33:01;33:02;"Strong words."
33:02;33:04;"I believe people have called them a Radiohead ripoff."
33:04;33:05;"Melodramatic post-rock?"
33:05;33:06;"Yes."
33:06;33:07;"People have said that."
33:07;33:08;"So wait, wait, I'm sorry."
33:08;33:12;"I was spacing out for like 15 seconds."
33:12;33:17;"This is songs that were commissioned by/inspired by the Olympics?"
33:17;33:21;"Some of these songs were commissioned by the Olympics, some of them were just used in various"
33:21;33:22;"Olympic capacities."
33:22;33:25;"These are just songs associated with the Olympics."
33:25;33:29;"The good folks at USA Today are just trying to go for something pretty broad."
33:29;33:30;"Great."
33:30;33:31;"So what year is the Muse song?"
33:31;33:36;"All right, so Muse, do you remember where the 2012 Olympics were?"
33:36;33:37;"Beijing?"
33:37;33:38;"Far from it."
33:38;33:40;"Well, I don't remember then."
33:40;33:41;"When was Beijing?"
33:41;33:42;"Like '08?"
33:42;33:44;"The Beijing Olympics were in 2008."
33:44;33:45;"Okay."
33:45;33:48;"The 2012 Olympics were in London."
33:48;33:50;"Don't you remember those classic London Olympics?"
33:50;33:52;"Very vaguely."
33:52;33:54;"So they went out to Radiohead and they said no."
33:54;34:00;"And they went out to Oasis and they said, ""We're too drunk and we're not rolling together"
34:00;34:01;"anymore."""
34:01;34:04;"I feel like Oasis would have, if they had their act together, it would have been the"
34:04;34:06;"perfect band to do the London Olympics."
34:06;34:07;"Oasis was broken up by this time."
34:07;34:08;"Yeah, so they went out to Muse."
34:08;34:11;"Okay, so a little further down the list they go to Muse."
34:11;34:15;"Very talented band in their own right, but perhaps not their first choice."
34:15;34:19;"I guess USA Today has some pretty harsh words."
34:19;34:24;"I guess a BBC radio host named John Holmes memorably compared this London Olympics theme"
34:24;34:29;"to an orchestra falling down some stairs and the noise of a rhino knocking a wall down."
34:29;34:30;"That's funny."
34:30;34:31;"That's ridiculous."
34:31;34:37;"That sounds like a diss that the opera critic from a paper would write in the 1890s."
34:37;34:41;"Stravinsky's new piece, Rite of Spring, sounds like a rhino knocking a wall down."
34:41;34:44;"Right, and somebody, ""Ha ha, good heavens."""
34:44;34:45;"Sounds awful."
34:45;34:46;"Scandalous."
34:46;34:52;"But even USA Today calls this song, ""An unbearable hodgepodge of crashing drums, dramatic strings,"
34:52;34:56;"and strained vocals,"" and may be the game's worst official song."
34:56;34:57;"Now hold on a second."
34:57;34:59;"Is this super dissonant or something?"
34:59;35:00;"Let's find out."
35:00;35:11;"Woke up, got out of bed, pulled a comb across my head."
35:11;35:14;"Yeah!"
35:14;35:15;"Where those vocals, Muse?"
35:15;35:24;"Come on."
35:24;35:26;"Sounds very British."
35:26;35:30;"It sounds very orderly, too."
35:30;35:40;"Are there not going to be vocals?"
35:40;35:41;"Drums sound terrible."
35:41;35:44;"No disrespect to the producer."
35:44;35:50;"Well, not my kind of drums."
35:50;36:00;"I like that Muse has a sense of humor."
36:00;36:03;"Like, they're getting a little quirky."
36:03;36:15;"So this is sort of like if Stone Temple Pilots had a song for the '96 Atlanta Olympics."
36:15;36:18;"Roughly."
36:18;36:20;"Maybe more like it live."
36:20;36:24;"Yeah, maybe that's better."
36:24;36:33;"Oh, they went heavy."
36:33;36:39;"Can you imagine?"
36:39;36:47;"Oh, they're going in with this guitar here."
36:47;36:48;"I kind of respect it."
36:48;36:54;"Can you imagine the Olympic committee in London like, ""Okay, guys, we got the final mix back."
36:54;36:55;"Let's listen to it."""
36:55;36:59;"Just playing this for Prince Charles."
36:59;37:04;"Yeah, playing this to a very silent boardroom."
37:04;37:05;"Excellent."
37:05;37:09;"Kind of a Queen vibe here."
37:09;37:10;"Oh, yeah, big time."
37:10;37:24;"Actually, I'm kind of into it."
37:24;37:34;"We have called upon all the countries of Earth to gather in our imperial capital of London."
37:34;37:37;"Wow, the lead singing is brutal."
37:37;37:39;"He has a good voice, though."
37:39;37:41;"Maybe not his finest moment."
37:41;37:44;"They were going for it, at least."
37:44;37:46;"You know what that just made me think about?"
37:46;37:50;"What's so crazy is like, look, the human stories of the Olympics."
37:50;37:51;"That's real."
37:51;37:53;"Somebody working hard and achieving something."
37:53;37:55;"We're not talking about eight mile hike, man."
37:55;37:57;"We're talking about 10, 15 years of training."
37:57;37:59;"Giving your whole life to something."
37:59;38:01;"Dedicating your life."
38:01;38:02;"Health and fitness."
38:02;38:03;"That's serious."
38:03;38:11;"Everything else about the Olympics is truly playing on people's emotions in a pretty crass"
38:11;38:12;"way."
38:12;38:16;"You know the countries, they work so hard to win the bid."
38:16;38:19;"It's supposedly going to pay off for the people of the city."
38:19;38:24;"As always, the elites are the ones walking off with the suitcases full of cash."
38:24;38:29;"But also, it's this kind of awkward infomercial for the city."
38:29;38:32;"When you watch the Olympics on NBC, they keep cutting the stuff."
38:32;38:35;"Let's take a minute to learn more about the city of Rio."
38:35;38:39;"You know when they do the opening ceremony, it's kind of like this presentation about"
38:39;38:41;"the culture of the country?"
38:41;38:45;"It really is like an infomercial that's kind of like, China, open for business."
38:45;38:46;"Beijing 2008."
38:46;38:51;"If we can afford to make this thing, we're pretty poppin'."
38:51;38:55;"Anyway, the number nine song is Barcelona."
38:55;38:58;"Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballé."
38:58;39:00;"Might be mispronouncing that."
39:00;39:04;"This is a fine duet taken off the Queen frontman's 1988 joint album of the same name with the"
39:04;39:06;"Spanish opera star."
39:06;39:07;"Let's check it out."
39:07;39:08;"The '88 Olympics?"
39:08;39:09;"Seoul?"
39:09;39:10;"No, maybe Barcelona."
39:10;39:11;"Oh."
39:11;39:12;"Yeah, you're probably right."
39:12;39:38;"The"
39:38;40:07;"Barcelona Olympics were '92."
40:07;40:13;"I'm in."
40:13;40:19;"I'm in."
40:19;40:23;"Yes."
40:23;40:30;"It makes me sad about the Muse song a little bit."
40:30;40:32;"Yeah, it's kind of better than the Muse song."
40:32;40:38;"It's like, oh, okay, that's a more appropriate match between talent and the event."
40:38;40:41;"Oh, I don't know if I'd say that."
40:41;40:42;"We know the Olympics- I would say that."
40:42;40:45;"The Olympics used to be all about amateur athletes."
40:45;40:46;"Do you remember that?"
40:46;40:47;"It's true."
40:47;40:52;"It used to be NBA players couldn't play in the Olympics until the Dream Team."
40:52;40:58;"So in the early '80s, they were just like, you play for the Washington Wizards, so you"
40:58;41:04;"cannot compete in the Olympics, but you gymnast who's been training in a federally funded"
41:04;41:08;"gym for the past five years, you're an amateur."
41:08;41:09;"You can come on down."
41:09;41:10;"What does that mean?"
41:10;41:11;"Yeah, it's weird."
41:11;41:14;"Plus, I think all the athletes now, that's what they do."
41:14;41:19;"They're not like a school teacher who happens to be great at gym."
41:19;41:20;"That'd be cool."
41:20;41:36;"The number eight song on the USA Today list of songs tangentially related to the Olympics"
41:36;41:39;"is Rise by Katy Perry."
41:39;41:41;"It has impassioned lyrics about perseverance."
41:41;41:43;"Ready to hear it?"
41:43;41:44;"Yeah."
41:44;41:46;"I think she also performed this at the DNC."
41:46;41:50;"I was going to say, she's having a big summer."
41:50;41:51;"DNC, Olympics."
41:51;41:52;"Thrive."
41:52;42:06;"I think that word was also in the Muse song."
42:06;42:11;"There's like a real tension between the authenticity of the athletes who have dedicated their whole"
42:11;42:16;"lives to this moment, and then the spectacle of it all, where they're going to get someone"
42:16;42:21;"like Katy Perry, who's famous."
42:21;42:24;"I mean, Katy Perry devoted her life to singing and songwriting."
42:24;42:26;"Well, yeah."
42:26;42:31;"There isn't a sense of sacrifice and risk with Katy Perry, though."
42:31;42:32;"The way is-"
42:32;42:33;"I'll stop you right there, Jay."
42:33;42:35;"Clearly, you don't know much about Katy Perry."
42:35;42:40;"That makes me actually a better judge of her work, because I don't know her biography,"
42:40;42:41;"and I'm just hearing her music."
42:41;42:44;"Did you know that, first of all, I'm a big Katy Perry fan?"
42:44;42:45;"Okay."
42:45;42:47;"And if you don't think she's had adversity in her life-"
42:47;42:48;"I'm not saying she didn't have adversity."
42:48;42:49;"I'm saying-"
42:49;42:50;"Do you know what her real name is?"
42:50;42:51;"No."
42:51;42:52;"It's Kate Hudson."
42:52;42:53;"That's tough."
42:53;42:54;"That's a tough hand to be dealt."
42:54;42:55;"Okay, yeah."
42:55;42:57;"Imagine that your real last name was Gyllenhaal."
42:57;43:03;"You're trying to put up, do an art show somewhere, and everybody's like, ""Oh, cool, Jake Gyllenhaal"
43:03;43:04;"paints?"""
43:04;43:05;"And you're like, ""Yeah, man."""
43:05;43:08;"Then they roll up all disappointed, and then you got to change your name just to survive?"
43:08;43:09;"That's messed up."
43:09;43:10;"So that's messed up."
43:10;43:13;"So she had to change her name from Kate Hudson to Katy Perry."
43:13;43:16;"On top of that, she started out in the Christian rock scene."
43:16;43:20;"Notoriously difficult to get out of, but she did."
43:20;43:21;"Now she's thriving."
43:21;43:23;"I'm not even going after her as a person."
43:23;43:24;"Okay, you're saying the song does not have-"
43:24;43:26;"Her work does not-"
43:26;43:31;"To me, her work and what she, in a broad sense, symbolizes in the culture, seems like a bad"
43:31;43:41;"match for struggle and perseverance that are the qualities that we value in these athletes."
43:41;43:44;"You don't feel the dark majesty of this chorus?"
43:44;43:45;"No."
43:45;43:51;"I mean, obviously, the person who's going to sing the song to represent the sacrifice"
43:51;43:54;"and the hard work of our athletes, they have to have a big old voice."
43:54;43:56;"I don't agree with that."
43:56;43:57;"You can't have a Bob Dylan."
43:57;44:00;"Well, nothing Dylan."
44:00;44:01;"Here's what I'm saying."
44:01;44:06;"I like it if the musicians were equally obscure as the athletes are."
44:06;44:11;"So if it was some sort of like, you know, some dude from Ghana playing guitar, that"
44:11;44:14;"would feel more harmonious to me."
44:14;44:18;"I'm sure Ghana has its own Olympics, Katy Perry songs."
44:18;44:21;"Well, that's what I want to hear."
44:21;44:27;"Well, the number seven song is by somebody that you probably respect more than Katy Perry,"
44:27;44:28;"Bjork."
44:28;44:29;"Sure."
44:29;44:34;"There's more sense of risk and adversity with her."
44:34;44:35;"For what?"
44:35;44:36;"What do you mean for what?"
44:36;44:38;"I mean, like her work aesthetically is just-"
44:38;44:40;"Right, yeah, but how did the risk pay off?"
44:40;44:41;"What kind of question is that?"
44:41;44:42;"Bjork's a legend."
44:42;44:43;"She'll be remembered."
44:43;44:44;"Well, we don't actually know how she'll be remembered."
44:44;44:48;"I'm not even want to get into that territory."
44:48;44:50;"You know what, man?"
44:50;44:55;"This Icelandic trailblazer blends rippling synths and whirring siren calls on this nautical"
44:55;44:56;"ballad."
44:56;44:58;"Oh, whirring siren calls."
44:58;44:59;"I like the concept of a nautical ballad."
44:59;45:02;"I've tried to write nautical ballads before."
45:02;45:06;"This was written specifically for the 2004 Summer Games in Greece."
45:06;45:08;"Remember those '04 games in Greece?"
45:08;45:09;"Vaguely."
45:09;45:11;"It was a real boon for the Greek economy."
45:11;45:12;"Worked out great."
45:12;45:17;"All the international attention on Greece, taking it back to the homeland of the Olympics."
45:17;45:20;"Really brought in a lot of foreign investment."
45:20;45:21;"That's a bummer."
45:21;45:23;"Kickstart the economy."
45:23;45:25;"This was on the album Adula."
45:25;45:28;"She says she wrote it for the 2004 Summer Games in Greece."
45:28;45:36;"One breath away from mother Oceania."
45:36;45:43;"Your nimble feet make prints."
45:43;45:47;"And my son."
45:47;45:53;"I haven't heard Bjork in a while."
45:53;45:57;"Good for yourselves."
45:57;46:09;"Since you left my wet embrace and crawled ashore."
46:09;46:15;"Every boy is a snake."
46:15;46:19;"Now I'm gonna let everybody in on a big trade secret."
46:19;46:27;"Most of the time when you hear that somebody wrote a song for something, it's a goddamn"
46:27;46:28;"lie."
46:28;46:29;"It was sitting around."
46:30;46:37;"There's always like, yeah, like the song for a movie, a song for a, to raise, you know,"
46:37;46:40;"charity song, a song for the sporting event."
46:40;46:42;"I feel like we were joking about that recently."
46:42;46:45;"Oh, the Peter Cetera for Karate Kid 2."
46:45;46:46;"Oh, yeah."
46:46;46:47;"Like, really?"
46:47;46:52;"I saw the first cut of Karate Kid 2 and I just sat down."
46:52;46:54;"I couldn't stop writing, man."
46:54;46:55;"Gloria Love, dude."
46:55;46:56;"No."
46:56;46:58;"So, yeah, Bjork wrote that song."
46:58;47:02;"According to the good folks at USA Today, she wrote that song for the Olympics."
47:02;47:06;"This next one, this is a proper Olympics anthem."
47:06;47:08;"It was for the 2010 Winter Olympics."
47:08;47:12;"There's no way you could forget what the 2010 Winter Olympics were."
47:12;47:13;"Utah?"
47:13;47:15;"Oh, you're killing me, man."
47:15;47:18;"They were, of course, in Vancouver."
47:18;47:19;"Okay."
47:19;47:22;"Shout out to Nick Kerkovich."
47:22;47:25;"I think you're thinking of the 2006 Olympics."
47:25;47:29;"You know who brought the 2006 Winter Olympics to Utah?"
47:29;47:30;"Romney."
47:30;47:31;"Shout out to Romney."
47:31;47:33;"Romney."
47:33;47:40;"So this song was for the 2010 Olympics, Vancouver, so they had to get a couple Canadian stars"
47:40;47:41;"to collab on a song."
47:41;47:43;"Brian Adams."
47:43;47:44;"Oh, wow."
47:44;47:45;"Yes."
47:45;47:46;"Really?"
47:46;47:47;"Uh-huh."
47:47;47:48;"Okay."
47:48;47:49;"And?"
47:49;47:50;"And the other one is female."
47:50;47:53;"I would love to say Joni Mitchell, but not her."
47:53;47:54;"Of course not."
47:54;47:55;"She would never do that."
47:55;47:58;"She might, but that'd be tight, but no."
47:58;47:59;"Somebody--"
47:59;48:00;"From that era, '80s?"
48:00;48:02;"No, no, no, no, more from like the '90s, 2000s era."
48:02;48:03;"Oh, Celine?"
48:03;48:04;"No."
48:04;48:05;"She's made for it."
48:05;48:06;"Oh, yeah."
48:06;48:07;"How could they not get Celine?"
48:07;48:08;"She clearly said no."
48:08;48:09;"Canadian Olympics song."
48:09;48:10;"Shania?"
48:10;48:11;"No."
48:11;48:13;"Remember, she kind of disowned Canada."
48:13;48:15;"She lives in Switzerland."
48:15;48:16;"Um, geez."
48:16;48:18;"I don't know."
48:18;48:19;"Nelly Furtado."
48:19;48:20;"Oh, okay."
48:20;48:22;"I wouldn't know she's Canadian."
48:22;48:24;"You didn't know that Nelly Furtado was Canadian?"
48:24;48:25;"Nope."
48:25;48:26;"That's Furtado 101, Jake."
48:26;48:27;"I'm getting schooled."
48:27;48:28;"You're getting schooled."
48:28;48:29;"How was the show tonight?"
48:29;48:30;"It was cool."
48:30;48:31;"You know what I learned?"
48:31;48:33;"Nelly Furtado's Canadian."
48:33;48:37;"Yeah, just like, ""No shit, Jake."""
48:37;48:40;"You'll be sleeping on the couch with that one."
48:40;48:43;"So, Brian Adams and Nelly Furtado got together."
48:43;48:45;"The Canadian government brought them together"
48:45;48:48;"to do an anthem for the 2010 Winter Olympics."
48:48;48:50;"It's called ""Bang the Drum."""
48:50;48:53;"Already has a sense of majesty."
48:57;49:01;"This sounds like Peter Cetera for the karate kid."
49:01;49:03;"This is from 2010."
49:03;49:05;"It sounds like it's from, like, 1985."
49:07;49:09;"Okay, now it's a little more."
49:26;49:28;"Ow."
49:28;49:29;"I'm into this."
49:41;49:42;"I'm into the melody."
49:42;49:44;"It's kind of folky."
49:50;49:51;"Weird mix."
49:51;49:53;"Yeah, the vocals are so low."
49:53;49:54;"That's rough."
49:54;49:57;"Clearly there's, like, a Olympic-song palette."
49:57;49:58;"Yeah."
49:58;50:00;"It's kind of, like, really cheesy,"
50:00;50:03;"bargain-basement, cinematic, grandeur,"
50:03;50:05;"and then just, like, some, ""Rawr,"""
50:05;50:07;"like, some, like, fake metal guitar."
50:07;50:08;"When you said ""cinematic,"""
50:08;50:10;"I even thought of, like, those animations"
50:10;50:13;"of popcorn and soda before a movie."
50:13;50:14;"You're at AMC Theatres,"
50:14;50:17;"and this is sort of, like, this animation from 25 years ago."
50:17;50:20;"Where you're on a roller coaster going down, like, the film."
50:20;50:22;"It's not the cool ones from, like, the '60s."
50:22;50:24;"It's, like, the one from 1995."
50:24;50:26;"Yeah, the roller coaster goes into, like,"
50:26;50:29;"a bucket of popcorn, and it's like that."
50:29;50:31;"I love that they still show the same one."
50:31;50:33;"This is what happens when you go by committee."
50:33;50:35;"Someone has, like, a slightly edgier idea,"
50:35;50:39;"and they're like, ""No, that's gonna alienate someone."""
50:39;50:41;"And then if you're, like, super famous,"
50:41;50:43;"then they'll, like, kind of listen to you."
50:43;50:45;"Yeah, if they're going through the lyric."
50:45;50:46;"That's how you get a lyric, like,"
50:46;50:50;"""From the east, from the west, each of us trying our best."""
50:50;50:52;"It would also be kind of interesting"
50:52;50:56;"if somebody did just write, like, a straight-up, like,"
50:56;50:59;"""We're the best"" type song for their country."
50:59;51:00;"That'd be tight."
51:00;51:01;"I mean, at least it's, like..."
51:01;51:02;"Tight."
51:02;51:04;"[laughs]"
51:04;51:05;"...jingoism."
51:05;51:07;"You know who'd be great? The Flaming Lips."
51:07;51:09;"To write an Olympic song?"
51:09;51:10;"Yes, they can write anthemic work."
51:10;51:12;"They also have, like, a sense of humor about it,"
51:12;51:14;"and they also have this, like, their shows"
51:14;51:17;"and their aesthetic is, like, self-aware,"
51:17;51:20;"but also, like, fully operatic."
51:20;51:22;"They could do it well."
51:22;51:23;"Eh!"
51:23;51:25;"No? Feel me on that, dawg."
51:25;51:27;"I feel like it would end up sounding like that previous song,"
51:27;51:30;"except it would be Wayne Coyne and Miley Cyrus."
51:30;51:32;"It would sound exactly the same."
51:32;51:33;"Not exactly."
51:33;51:36;"See, there'd be, like, the narcissism of small differences."
51:36;51:39;"There'd be, like, a 15% difference."
51:39;51:40;"There'd be a theremin."
51:40;51:41;"Yeah, they're--"
51:41;51:42;"Whoo!"
51:42;51:45;"♪ From the east to the west ♪"
51:45;51:48;"♪ Each of us trying our best ♪"
51:48;51:51;"I'm pushing for Flaming Lips"
51:51;51:53;"representing the U.S. next Olympics."
51:53;51:59;"Okay, maybe when they have the 2048 Oklahoma City Summer Olympics."
51:59;52:01;"[laughing]"
52:01;52:03;"We can get the hologram Wayne Coyne"
52:03;52:06;"and hologram Miley Cyrus to do that together."
52:06;52:09;"The number five song on the list is"
52:09;52:13;"by a group called Flipside, called ""Someday."""
52:13;52:15;"The good folks at USA Today say,"
52:15;52:17;"""Hip-hop artists have mostly been passed over"
52:17;52:19;"""to use to penning Olympic tunes,"
52:19;52:21;"""but NBC made this Oakland group an exception"
52:21;52:25;"""when it picked 'Someday' as the theme for the 2006 Winter Games."""
52:25;52:27;"Okay, so NBC--"
52:27;52:29;"Okay, so we don't even know who's picking these songs."
52:29;52:32;"Maybe some of them are picked by the Olympic committee,"
52:32;52:34;"but a lot of them are being picked by the good folks"
52:34;52:36;"at NBC/General Electric."
52:36;52:37;"Yeah."
52:37;52:38;"Interesting."
52:38;52:40;"So this is what they picked in 2006 for the Romney Olympics."
52:40;52:41;"Okay."
52:41;52:44;"# Come on"
52:44;52:50;"# Sha-na-na-na-na"

53:08;53:11;"# And keep on flying"
53:11;53:14;"More gravitas than the previous, I'd say."

53:16;53:18;"# Just wait, we're gonna be there someday"
53:18;53:20;"# Sipping on champagne, okay"
53:20;53:22;"# Gotta get these things one day"
53:22;53:24;"Oh, this is fake Dr. Dre."
53:24;53:26;"Yeah, it's a chronic 2001 rip-off."
53:26;53:29;"Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got something to say,"
53:29;53:31;"but another comes out when they move their lips."
53:31;53:33;"# Someday"
53:33;53:35;"You know about Dre."
53:35;53:38;"That's shamelessly weak."
53:38;53:40;"All right, we gotta cut it off right there, man."
53:40;53:41;"Moving on."
53:41;53:44;"Although, I gotta say, ripping off Dr. Dre"
53:44;53:48;"for the Romney Olympics song is conceptually interesting to me."
53:48;53:50;"Fair point."
53:50;53:52;"I'm not gonna get too mad about that."
53:52;53:54;"I mean, they changed it enough."
53:54;54:00;"# You and Me by Lou Huan and Sarah Brightman"
54:00;54:06;"They got two kind of classical-leaning singers"
54:06;54:08;"from America and China to get together"
54:08;54:10;"to do a song for the Beijing Olympics."
54:10;54:12;"I imagine it's gonna be pretty schmaltzy."
54:12;54:14;"We're gonna actually listen to the live version"
54:14;54:16;"they actually performed at the Olympics."
54:16;54:17;"Cool."
54:17;54:20;"So just picture you're in that beautiful Bird's Nest Stadium"
54:20;54:25;"in Beijing, and you hear this live."

55:10;55:12;"It's gonna feel so weird"
55:12;55:14;"when the English-language lyrics come in, though."
55:14;55:16;"I wonder what song this is."
55:16;55:18;"Was it written for it, or...?"
55:18;55:20;"I think so."

56:12;56:14;"All right, we get the idea."
56:14;56:16;"That song's called ""You and Me,"""
56:16;56:19;"and I believe it's about American people"
56:19;56:22;"and Chinese people coming together as one"

56:26;56:29;"Absolutely."
56:29;56:31;"To our brothers and sisters across the sea,"

56:43;56:46;"The number-three song is called ""Hand in Hand"""
56:46;56:51;"by a band called Coreana, or Coreana."
56:51;56:53;"I don't know how to pronounce it,"
56:53;56:56;"but they're a band from South Korea,"

58:28;58:30;"This is from '88."
58:30;58:32;"This is four years after ""We Are the World."""
58:32;58:34;"It's from that era."
58:34;58:36;"Heavily indebted to ""We Are the World."""
58:36;58:38;"It's been a long time since there was a charity single"
58:38;58:40;"that really, like, took over the world. Yeah."
58:40;58:42;"I think people..."
58:42;58:44;"Our hearts are just too hard now"
58:44;58:47;"to accept a simple sentiment like ""We Are the World"" or..."
58:47;58:49;"I think the medium is just too old."
58:49;58:51;"It's atrophied."
58:51;58:54;"I don't think you'd be possible to write a song like that"
58:54;58:56;"that actually resonated."
58:56;58:59;"Because of, like, the empty promises of globalisation?"
58:59;59:02;"No, no, I mean, like, rock and pop songwriting is just..."
59:02;59:05;"What are we, 60 years out from Elvis?"
59:05;59:08;"I just feel like it's played out, dog."
59:08;59:10;"Just rock music. Yeah, like, the medium,"
59:10;59:12;"like, that style of songwriting is atrophied."
59:12;59:15;"Why can't you do, like, a pop R&B one?"
59:15;59:17;"I'm putting it all under the same umbrella."
59:17;59:19;"Post-war pop music."
59:19;59:21;"OK, but here's a question."
59:21;59:23;"What if ""Fight Song,"""
59:23;59:25;"which is a Tom Christmas favourite,"
59:25;59:27;"wasn't Rachel Plantains,"
59:27;59:31;"but instead was given to Rachel Plantains,"
59:31;59:34;"Justin Bieber, Britney Spears,"
59:34;59:36;"maybe, like, some international people,"
59:36;59:38;"like Psy,"
59:38;59:40;"and became, like, this global thing,"
59:40;59:42;"and just, like, the chorus is just, like,"
59:42;59:44;"all these people coming... Oh, wait, actually, I forgot."
59:44;59:46;"They did that at the DNC."
59:46;59:48;"It's, like, not actually, like, a wholesome song."
59:48;59:50;"""Fight Song""? Yeah."
59:50;59:52;"Well, I'm just saying large numbers of people"
59:52;59:54;"still respond to it."
59:54;59:56;"I know, but this is my subjective vibe right now."
59:56;59:58;"Oh, you're just saying you wouldn't like it."
59:58;01:00:00;"I'm trying to get to the bottom"
01:00:00;01:00:03;"of why I think the South Korean song from 1988"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"is the best one we've heard so far."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"Okay. For the event."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"And it reminded me of ""We Are The World."""
01:00:09;01:00:12;"And there's something, like, in the zeitgeist,"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"something that is, like, intangible"
01:00:14;01:00:18;"that makes it impossible to write a song like that today."
01:00:18;01:00:20;"And I don't think ""Fight Song"" is like that."
01:00:20;01:00:23;"I think ""Fight Song"" is trying to be like that, but it's not."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"You just feel like it didn't hit the artistic mark."
01:00:25;01:00:27;"It didn't hit that emotional mark, yeah."
01:00:27;01:00:29;"We're living in the end times, man."
01:00:29;01:00:31;"God is dead."
01:00:31;01:00:33;"People got nothing to believe in anymore."
01:00:33;01:00:35;"You're right. It's harder to get people pumped."
01:00:35;01:00:37;"Look, we have our two least popular"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"presidential candidates in history."
01:00:39;01:00:41;"Nations divided."
01:00:41;01:00:44;"People can't unite under the banner of a simple idea"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"like ""We Are The World"" anymore."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"Yeah."
01:00:47;01:00:50;"Number two, ""The Power of the Dream"" by Celine Dion."
01:00:50;01:00:52;"Okay, we had the right impulse."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"Of course Celine Dion had something to do with the Olympics."

01:01:31;01:01:33;"Yeah, but they blamed that dude Richard Jewell."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"Right."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"Really put that guy through the wringer."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"Can you imagine being that guy?"

01:01:43;01:01:44;"they needed to pin it on somebody,"
01:01:44;01:01:46;"because they wanted people to feel safe."
01:01:46;01:01:47;"So they're just like, ""We got him."""

01:01:55;01:01:56;"I think it ruined his life."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"Yeah."
01:01:57;01:02:00;"So the Olympics bring people a lot of joy."

01:12:10;01:12:12;"bunks back to not get caught."
01:12:12;01:12:13;"Yeah."
01:12:13;01:12:15;"A lot of hijinks in the Olympics."
01:12:15;01:12:19;"♪"
01:12:19;01:12:20;"All right."
01:12:20;01:12:21;"It's positive."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"That's cool."
01:12:22;01:12:23;"Yeah, I mean, I liked it."
01:12:23;01:12:26;"It was kind of quirky and bouncy."
01:12:26;01:12:29;"You know the only time I ever met Stuart Murdoch?"
01:12:29;01:12:30;"No, tell me."
01:12:30;01:12:32;"It was in Korea."
01:12:32;01:12:33;"Come full circle."
01:12:33;01:12:34;"Do tell."
01:12:34;01:12:36;"It's not a very interesting story,"
01:12:36;01:12:39;"but it's just like life on the road as a musician,"
01:12:39;01:12:42;"especially when you're going all over the world,"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"sometimes you get really jet lagged,"
01:12:44;01:12:45;"and you wake up really early,"
01:12:45;01:12:48;"and you come down to the hotel buffet,"
01:12:48;01:12:51;"and sometimes if your other bands are in town"
01:12:51;01:12:52;"or you're at a festival,"
01:12:52;01:12:55;"it can be a little bit like a school cafeteria vibe,"
01:12:55;01:12:58;"because, you know, it's like at lunch or dinner,"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"you might get the bands are rolling together,"
01:13:00;01:13:01;"but in the morning, you know,"
01:13:01;01:13:04;"one dude wakes up at 4.30, one dude sleeps through,"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"you never know, so you kind of go down solo."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"So I've had a few of those experiences over the years"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"where you come down and you just like see somebody"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"sitting by themselves, and it's like,"
01:13:12;01:13:13;"""Hey, what's up, man?"""
01:13:13;01:13:18;"So I feel like, I think I was down there at this hotel in Seoul,"
01:13:18;01:13:21;"and I've always been a big Bell & Sebastian fan,"
01:13:21;01:13:25;"and I saw Stewart eating breakfast by himself,"
01:13:25;01:13:27;"and I think I literally just rolled up cafeteria style,"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"just like holding, you know, I hit my breakfast,"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"and I was just like, ""Hey, what's up, man?"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"""Mind if I join you?"""
01:13:33;01:13:34;"A little bit out of character for me,"
01:13:34;01:13:35;"but like, I don't know."
01:13:35;01:13:38;"You have to imagine growing up listening to Bell & Sebastian,"
01:13:38;01:13:40;"you have to imagine that Stewart's a nice guy."
01:13:40;01:13:41;"- Yeah. - Like, I wouldn't do that"
01:13:41;01:13:44;"to Tom York. - Right."
01:13:44;01:13:46;"Actually, I do mind."
01:13:46;01:13:49;"He would probably just stare at you and not say a word."
01:13:49;01:13:50;"[laughs]"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"Actually, I have a ""Stewart is a nice guy"" story."
01:13:52;01:13:53;"Really?"
01:13:53;01:13:57;"I lived in San Francisco in like the early 2000s, like '03,"
01:13:57;01:14:00;"and there was a friend of mine that would always host house shows."
01:14:00;01:14:03;"He had like a tiny backyard in this little row house"
01:14:03;01:14:05;"in the Mission District,"
01:14:05;01:14:07;"and so I forget who was even playing."
01:14:07;01:14:09;"Maybe it was like Pound Sign,"
01:14:09;01:14:12;"some kind of local pop, San Francisco pop band."
01:14:12;01:14:13;"Yeah."
01:14:13;01:14:15;"But anyway, Stewart showed up to the show."
01:14:15;01:14:17;"He knew someone that was there or something,"
01:14:17;01:14:20;"and then they were like passing a hat around"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"for everyone to put in like a few dollars."
01:14:22;01:14:23;"Yeah."
01:14:23;01:14:24;"And he threw in a hundred."
01:14:24;01:14:25;"Tight."
01:14:25;01:14:26;"I saw it, I was like--"
01:14:26;01:14:28;"It was back in the '90s when that meant something."
01:14:28;01:14:29;"Or like '03."
01:14:29;01:14:31;"But yeah, it was like--"
01:14:31;01:14:32;"It meant something."
01:14:32;01:14:33;"Everyone else put in like three bucks."
01:14:33;01:14:34;"Yeah."
01:14:34;01:14:35;"Anyway, I was very impressed."
01:14:35;01:14:36;"Very classy move."
01:14:36;01:14:38;"You know, I feel like if that happened today,"
01:14:38;01:14:41;"you'd probably have somebody on Snapchat being like,"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"""Look at Stewart trying to stunt on us."""
01:14:43;01:14:44;"[laughs]"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"It's a more negative time."
01:14:46;01:14:49;"He gave $100 to this touring band."
01:14:49;01:14:51;"What an a-hole."
01:14:51;01:14:53;"Yeah, why didn't you give $10,000?"
01:14:53;01:14:54;"Dib."
01:14:54;01:14:55;"[laughs]"
01:14:55;01:14:58;"But anyway, Stewart is a very nice guy"
01:14:58;01:15:01;"to any of the younger folks."
01:15:01;01:15:04;"I really hate saying that, but I also love it."
01:15:04;01:15:06;"To any of the younger folks listening,"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"if you don't know Bell and Sebastian,"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"they are legends."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"You got to go listen to some of those first few albums."
01:15:11;01:15:12;"Great band."
01:15:13;01:15:14;"We're agreeing for once."
01:15:14;01:15:15;"That's true."
01:15:15;01:15:16;"Bell and Sebastian--"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"Who would have thought Bell and Sebastian"
01:15:18;01:15:19;"would see eye to eye on?"
01:15:19;01:15:21;"Bell and Sebastian is so--"
01:15:21;01:15:25;"They're such poster children for indie"
01:15:25;01:15:28;"that when indie falls out of fashion,"
01:15:28;01:15:31;"so do they, you know, in a certain place."
01:15:31;01:15:33;"But it's also like they're the type of band,"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"when you really go back and you--"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"the quality of the songwriting,"
01:15:37;01:15:38;"it's like the Smets."
01:15:38;01:15:39;"It's classic."
01:15:39;01:15:40;"That's what I believe."
01:15:40;01:15:42;"I agree completely."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"That's my goddamn opinion."
01:15:44;01:15:45;"You know what?"
01:15:45;01:15:47;"Another song that was unofficially written"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"for the Olympics, or at least was not chosen,"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"Randy Newman, ""I Love L.A."""
01:15:51;01:15:52;"Really?"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"Yeah, '84 Olympics."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"We're in Los Angeles."
01:15:56;01:15:57;"Remember that was a big deal"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"'cause people were mad about the smog."
01:15:59;01:16:00;"Right."
01:16:00;01:16:01;"Remember smog?"
01:16:01;01:16:02;"Oh, I remember."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"Nobody talks about smog anymore."
01:16:04;01:16:05;"People talk about it,"
01:16:05;01:16:06;"but it's a lot better than it used to be."
01:16:06;01:16:08;"I never hear anybody talking about smog."
01:16:08;01:16:09;"When was the last time you heard somebody"
01:16:09;01:16:11;"talking about smog?"
01:16:11;01:16:13;"Yesterday."
01:16:13;01:16:16;"Now you're just playing with me."
01:16:16;01:16:17;"Who?"
01:16:17;01:16:18;"My girlfriend."
01:16:18;01:16:20;"Fuck."
01:16:20;01:16:22;"I call a bitch, man."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"Nobody talks about smog anymore."
01:16:24;01:16:27;"On Monday, my dad mentioned smog."
01:16:27;01:16:29;"I have a very specific memory of it."
01:16:29;01:16:32;"But anyway, let's move on."
01:16:32;01:16:35;"So, Randy Newman was asked to write a song"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"to be the theme for the '84 Olympics."
01:16:37;01:16:39;"He's a classic L.A. musician."
01:16:39;01:16:40;"He's perfect for that."
01:16:40;01:16:41;"He's perfect for it."
01:16:41;01:16:43;"But whoever asked him,"
01:16:43;01:16:45;"they should have done a little more research"
01:16:45;01:16:48;"'cause Randy Newman is known"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"to be very sarcastic."
01:16:50;01:16:51;"Sly."
01:16:52;01:16:53;"Ironic."
01:16:53;01:16:56;"He'll say things in a song that he doesn't mean."
01:16:56;01:16:57;"In one of his big hits,"
01:16:57;01:16:59;"""Short People Got No Reason to Live,"""
01:16:59;01:17:01;"apparently he doesn't feel that way."
01:17:01;01:17:03;"[laughter]"
01:17:03;01:17:06;"Apparently he was trying to shine a harsh light"
01:17:06;01:17:07;"on society's prejudices."
01:17:07;01:17:09;"I wonder if they went out to Brian Wilson for that."
01:17:09;01:17:11;"He might have been--"
01:17:11;01:17:12;"'Cause he's so sincere."
01:17:12;01:17:14;"Yeah, Brian Wilson '84 I don't think was pretty."
01:17:14;01:17:16;"Yeah, not in any condition,"
01:17:16;01:17:17;"and nor was Harry Nielsen."
01:17:17;01:17:19;"But, you know, I would have asked the Beach Boys"
01:17:19;01:17:20;"just to write about it."
01:17:20;01:17:21;"Yeah."
01:17:21;01:17:23;"I think in '84--"
01:17:23;01:17:24;"When did Dennis die?"
01:17:24;01:17:26;"Before that."
01:17:26;01:17:27;"You know what would have been--"
01:17:27;01:17:28;"Oh, yeah, well, I don't need to--"
01:17:28;01:17:29;"You know what would have been gnarly?"
01:17:29;01:17:30;"Like, Glenn Frey solo."
01:17:30;01:17:31;"[laughter]"
01:17:31;01:17:33;"Perfect."
01:17:33;01:17:34;"I'd be into that."
01:17:34;01:17:38;"Or, like, you know, Van Halen was huge in '84."
01:17:38;01:17:39;"Oh, yeah."
01:17:39;01:17:41;"They should have just made ""Jump"" the official song."
01:17:41;01:17:42;"Oh, that would have been sick."
01:17:42;01:17:46;"But anyway, they asked Randy Newman to write a song,"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"and so he wrote a song called ""I Love L.A."""
01:17:48;01:17:49;"So far, so good, right?"
01:17:49;01:17:50;"Yep."
01:17:50;01:17:52;"Sounds perfect."
01:17:52;01:17:54;"And then they started looking through the lyrics,"
01:17:54;01:17:58;"and you start to realize that he's maybe turning"
01:17:58;01:18:02;"that classic harsh Newman glare"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"on the inadequacies of L.A."
01:18:04;01:18:07;"They're like, ""Man, the Olympics is not about"
01:18:07;01:18:10;"pointing out the flaws in humanity."
01:18:10;01:18:12;"It's about pretending they don't exist."""
01:18:12;01:18:13;"[laughter]"
01:18:13;01:18:17;"And a lot of people don't really know,"
01:18:17;01:18:19;"'cause, you know, they still play ""I Love L.A."""
01:18:19;01:18:20;"at, like, sporting events, and--"
01:18:20;01:18:21;"Yeah."
01:18:21;01:18:23;"And ""I Love L.A.""-- I love it."
01:18:23;01:18:24;"Yeah, I love it, too."
01:18:24;01:18:26;"I love ""I Love L.A."""
01:18:26;01:18:28;"Remind me of some of the lyrics, though."
01:18:28;01:18:29;"It's been a while."
01:18:29;01:18:31;"Okay, ""Rollin' down somethin' highway"
01:18:31;01:18:34;"with a big nasty redhead at my side."""
01:18:34;01:18:36;"Already a weird thing to say."
01:18:36;01:18:38;"Nasty."
01:18:38;01:18:41;"There's this beginning about how he hates New York City,"
01:18:41;01:18:42;"it's cold in its damp,"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"and all the people dress like monkeys."
01:18:44;01:18:46;"I don't know what that's supposed to mean."
01:18:46;01:18:47;"Do they have fur on?"
01:18:47;01:18:48;"I guess."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"""Let's leave Chicago to the Eskimos."
01:18:50;01:18:52;"That town's a little too rugged for you and me,"
01:18:52;01:18:53;"you bad girl."""
01:18:53;01:18:58;"He's already kind of mocking intercity competition,"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"because if you tell somebody that Chicago's"
01:19:00;01:19:03;"too rugged for them, you're also kind of saying"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"that you're, like, lame."
01:19:04;01:19:06;"It's not good if the city's too rugged for you."
01:19:06;01:19:09;"So in the opening lines of the real part of the song,"
01:19:09;01:19:11;"""Rollin' down the Imperial Highway,"

01:19:26;01:19:29;"We're gonna ride it 'til we just can't ride it no more."""
01:19:29;01:19:32;"And then he's saying all this really positive stuff,"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"and he's saying, ""I love L.A."""
01:19:34;01:19:38;"But then he gets way darker in the second verse."

01:43:25;01:43:27;"That gets my goat, man."
01:43:27;01:43:30;"Every song has that drop moment."
01:43:30;01:43:32;"Don't treat us like idiots, Snake."
01:43:32;01:43:34;"Give us a new sound for the drop."
01:43:34;01:43:39;"- Yeah, I just went from being generously excited"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"about this tropical Bieber vibe"
01:43:41;01:43:43;"to just being fatigued by it."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"- They did the pitched up vocal one again."
01:43:45;01:43:46;"(vocalizing)"
01:43:46;01:43:47;"They could have done anything."
01:43:47;01:43:49;"They could have had a trumpet come in."
01:43:49;01:43:52;"They could put a chopped up Reagan speech."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"It would have been more interesting than that."
01:43:54;01:43:55;"(vocalizing)"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"I was with it too, up until that point."
01:43:57;01:43:58;"- You know what?"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"I want them to use Jimmy Page."
01:44:00;01:44:02;"Like, you know that Zeppelin song, ""Fool in the Rain""?"
01:44:02;01:44:03;"(vocalizing)"
01:44:03;01:44:05;"It has some of that like, calypso-y,"
01:44:05;01:44:07;"like, I don't even know what, like tropical."
01:44:07;01:44:08;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:44:08;01:44:11;"- And he rips that like, huge octave pedal solo on it."
01:44:11;01:44:12;"(vocalizing)"
01:44:12;01:44:14;"It's like the sickest solo."
01:44:14;01:44:15;"- That could work."
01:44:15;01:44:19;"Like, if they got Page in with that same tone"
01:44:19;01:44:22;"and just did like a weird, like eight minute version."
01:44:22;01:44:23;"- That would be cool."
01:44:23;01:44:23;"- That would be sick."
01:44:23;01:44:25;"- 'Cause also, you know, these songs."
01:44:25;01:44:26;"- I'm not DJ Snake."
01:44:26;01:44:27;"- These songs are really high stakes"
01:44:27;01:44:29;"because the entire song builds up to the drop."
01:44:29;01:44:30;"- Right."
01:44:30;01:44:32;"- The intro to the verse to the pre-chorus"
01:44:32;01:44:33;"to the chorus to the drop."
01:44:33;01:44:35;"- That's when you drop in with the octave pedal."
01:44:35;01:44:38;"72 year old Jimmy Page is like, crushing it."
01:44:38;01:44:39;"- Snake, man."
01:44:39;01:44:41;"The people have spoken, man."
01:44:41;01:44:43;"- Or like, we don't wanna hear another pitched up"
01:44:43;01:44:44;"baby voice, man."
01:44:44;01:44:47;"We wanna hear some Jimmy Page."
01:44:47;01:44:48;"- You have a direct line to Diplo"
01:44:48;01:44:52;"next time he's working with Bieber."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"Get Page down there and just be like,"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"dude, you crushed on Fool in the Rain."
01:44:56;01:44:57;"I know that was 40 years ago."
01:44:57;01:44:59;"- Get in, man."
01:44:59;01:45:01;"- Bring that same octave pedal and just."
01:45:01;01:45:04;"(vocalizing)"
01:45:04;01:45:05;"- That was a bummer."
01:45:05;01:45:07;"The drop on the Chainsmokers song was more interesting."
01:45:07;01:45:08;"- Yeah."
01:45:08;01:45:10;"- Kudos to the Chainsmokers."
01:45:10;01:45:13;"Budos to DJ Snake."
01:45:14;01:45:17;"Back to 1984."
01:45:17;01:45:20;"The number one song this month in 1984,"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"history repeats itself, man,"
01:45:22;01:45:27;"was for a movie that a lot of people think came out in 2016."
01:45:27;01:45:28;"- Oh."
01:45:28;01:45:31;"- But I wanna let all the kids know something,"
01:45:31;01:45:34;"that actually this movie that everybody got excited"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"about this summer, it was based on an older film"
01:45:36;01:45:39;"that came out in 1984 called Ghostbusters."
01:45:39;01:45:41;"- One of my favorite films of all time."
01:45:41;01:45:42;"- It's a great film."
01:45:42;01:45:45;"The theme song was by a guy called Ray Parker Jr."
01:45:45;01:45:48;"and it was called Ghostbusters."
01:45:48;01:45:49;"This is a big song, man."
01:45:49;01:45:50;"- Huge."
01:45:50;01:45:54;"- He got sued by Huey Lewis for it, though."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"- Right."
01:45:55;01:45:58;"(dramatic music)"
01:45:58;01:46:07;"- '80s pop is so weird, just that kinda like,"
01:46:07;01:46:08;"de-fanged rock, like."
01:46:08;01:46:10;"(imitates rock music)"
01:46:10;01:46:11;"- That's a great way to put it."
01:46:11;01:46:13;"- De-fanged rock."

01:46:25;01:46:28;"- Like the montage scene in the film"
01:46:28;01:46:30;"is when their business is just taking off"
01:46:30;01:46:32;"and ghosts are--"
01:46:32;01:46:33;"- Right."
01:46:33;01:46:35;"- Spreading out all over the city."
01:46:35;01:46:37;"No job is too big, no fee is too big."
01:46:37;01:46:38;"- That's right."
01:46:38;01:46:41;"It's classic beginning of act two of a film."

01:46:47;01:46:51;"and there's just like that temple and the dogs?"
01:46:51;01:46:52;"- Oh yeah, temple of the dog."
01:46:52;01:46:56;"- There's a temple and the weird gozer dogs are there."
01:46:56;01:46:57;"- That was in the first one."
01:46:57;01:46:58;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:46:58;01:46:59;"- Oh, the second one's the painting."
01:46:59;01:47:00;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:47:00;01:47:02;"- So that's what was poppin' back in the summer of '84."
01:47:02;01:47:04;"Ghostbusters."
01:47:04;01:47:05;"Good."
01:47:05;01:47:05;"Not great."
01:47:05;01:47:08;"- Not a great song, but."
01:47:08;01:47:11;"- I mean, all in all, that was a decent top five for '84."
01:47:11;01:47:13;"- I mean, a Tina and the Bruce, I mean."
01:47:13;01:47:15;"- The Tina and the Bruce really helped."
01:47:15;01:47:17;"- Let's not shortchange the Rod, though."
01:47:17;01:47:19;"- The Rod was garbage."
01:47:19;01:47:20;"I think the Jax is pretty good."
01:47:20;01:47:22;"Ghostbusters, it is what it is."
01:47:22;01:47:25;"Now, the number one song on iTunes this week"
01:47:25;01:47:28;"is also from the Suicide Squad soundtrack."
01:47:28;01:47:31;"All right, so that's an obvious parallel right there."
01:47:31;01:47:34;"From 1984 to 2016, we still love a good movie soundtrack."
01:47:34;01:47:35;"- Right."
01:47:35;01:47:37;"- This is by 21 Pilots."
01:47:37;01:47:39;"Something new from these guys."
01:47:39;01:47:40;"Heathens."
01:47:41;01:47:42;"- Similar intro to Ghostbusters."

01:48:54;01:48:55;"I'm trying to."
01:48:55;01:48:57;"- You know, the kind of like rough thing is like,"
01:48:57;01:48:59;"the people who put together soundtracks know better"
01:48:59;01:49:02;"than to be like, the song's called Suicide Squad."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"So we'd love it if you could write a song"
01:49:03;01:49:04;"called Suicide Squad."
01:49:04;01:49:06;"Maybe a chorus that's like the whole squad"
01:49:06;01:49:07;"is ready to suicide."
01:49:07;01:49:09;"You know, the people don't do that anymore,"
01:49:09;01:49:11;"but they still will probably be like,"
01:49:11;01:49:12;"""Hey guys, so the movie's Suicide Squad."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"""It's very dark."
01:49:14;01:49:16;"""In this movie, the heroes are villains."
01:49:16;01:49:18;"""Like we don't wanna tell you how to write the song,"
01:49:18;01:49:19;"""but like we're definitely looking for something"
01:49:19;01:49:21;"""that captures a kind of dark."""
01:49:21;01:49:22;"- Minor key."
01:49:22;01:49:24;"- ""Moody, yeah."
01:49:24;01:49:26;"""All my friends are heathens, villains."""
01:49:26;01:49:27;"Whatever, they did their thing."
01:49:27;01:49:28;"I got nothing against the song."
01:49:28;01:49:31;"Not great."
01:49:31;01:49:33;"- I'll admit, I like some other 21 Pilots songs."
01:49:33;01:49:35;"- I'm still getting my head around 21 Pilots,"
01:49:35;01:49:37;"'cause I've only heard a few songs."
01:49:37;01:49:39;"It's a weird combination of influences."
01:49:39;01:49:43;"It seems like part Radiohead, part Eminem."
01:49:43;01:49:44;"- I don't think a lot of people are throwing out Radiohead."
01:49:44;01:49:46;"- The way he breaks to that falsetto,"
01:49:46;01:49:47;"it's like very like, Tom York."
01:49:47;01:49:49;"- Oh yeah, okay, I could see that."
01:49:49;01:49:52;"- Like they definitely are Radiohead heads."
01:49:52;01:49:54;"- I think there's also the emo part"
01:49:54;01:49:55;"that you're forgetting about."
01:49:55;01:49:57;"Like the panic at the disco,"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"Fall Out Boy."
01:49:59;01:50:00;"- Right."
01:50:00;01:50:01;"- That whole movement."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"- You missed out on that."
01:50:02;01:50:03;"- Completely."
01:50:03;01:50:05;"When you say emo, I think of like Fugazi or something."
01:50:05;01:50:06;"- Yeah, no."
01:50:06;01:50:07;"- Not that."
01:50:07;01:50:08;"Fugazi at the Olympics, no that."
01:50:08;01:50:10;"(laughing)"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"- Well that wraps up the top five."
01:50:12;01:50:13;"I think, it was a close one,"
01:50:13;01:50:15;"but I think 84 pulled it out."
01:50:15;01:50:17;"84 has two Stone Cold classics."
01:50:17;01:50:18;"It's always hard to compare."
01:50:18;01:50:19;"- Very rare."
01:50:19;01:50:20;"- It's hard to compare Stone Cold classics"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"to anything new."
01:50:22;01:50:23;"We just don't know."
01:50:23;01:50:26;"Will any of these 2016 songs become Stone Cold classics?"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"- Unlikely, but possible."
01:50:28;01:50:29;"- Man, weirdly I think the best one"
01:50:29;01:50:31;"is the Chainsmokers."

01:50:52;01:50:54;"I think we learned a lot about health and fitness and sports."
01:50:54;01:50:57;"And I hope for your sake that you realize"
01:50:57;01:50:58;"the Olympics are still going on."
01:50:58;01:51:01;"So even though you missed the opening ceremony,"
01:51:01;01:51:04;"you missed fencing, you missed a lot of the swimming,"
01:51:04;01:51:06;"and a lot of the gymnastics,"
01:51:06;01:51:08;"there's still a lot more to come."
01:51:08;01:51:10;"Still got the marathon."
01:51:10;01:51:11;"- Oh, cool."
01:51:11;01:51:12;"- Basketball."
01:51:12;01:51:14;"- Marathon, that's intense."
01:51:14;01:51:15;"- Yeah, man."
01:51:15;01:51:16;"- That's a great event."
01:51:16;01:51:18;"- That's crazy, they run for 26 miles, man."
01:51:18;01:51:19;"- Mind-blowing."
01:51:19;01:51:21;"- And that's the original Olympic sport."
01:51:21;01:51:23;"So a lot of stuff to come."
01:51:23;01:51:26;"So I hope you can take off your hater hat for a second"
01:51:26;01:51:29;"and get a little caught up in Olympics fever."
