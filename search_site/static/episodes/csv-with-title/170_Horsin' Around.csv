00:19;00:21;"steady go"
00:21;00:26;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
00:26;00:28;"Let's begin"
00:33;00:35;"They passed me by"
00:35;00:37;"All of those great romances"
00:37;00:41;"The war I felt"
00:41;00:43;"Robbing me"
00:43;00:45;"Of my rightful chances"
00:45;00:47;"My picture clear"
00:47;00:51;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:51;00:55;"And so I dealt to the blow"
00:55;00:59;"When a bus had to go"
01:01;01:03;"It's different I want you to know"
01:03;01:07;"One of us is crying"
01:07;01:09;"One of us is lying"
01:09;01:13;"Leave me lonely babe"
01:13;01:17;"Time Crisis back again"
01:17;01:19;"Horse meat special"
01:19;01:21;"[horse neighing]"
01:21;01:23;"We need to add a lot of horse effects for this episode"
01:23;01:25;"I want a lot of"
01:25;01:27;"Nays, Giddys"
01:27;01:29;"Winnies"
01:29;01:31;"What are other horse sounds?"
01:31;01:33;"SignFolk can I get a number crunch?"
01:33;01:35;"What are the top five horse words?"
01:35;01:37;"Clumping sounds like the hoof"
01:37;01:39;"Oh yeah the hoofs"
01:39;01:41;"Maybe snorting"
01:41;01:43;"Snorting? Oh yeah yeah"
01:43;01:45;"I like playing horse effects"
01:45;01:47;"If I think someone's horsing around"
01:47;01:49;"You know"
01:49;01:51;"Suddenly somebody here is like"
01:51;01:53;"[horse neighing]"
01:53;01:55;"It's a good way to insert some fun into a conversation"
01:55;01:57;"If you have to have a slightly difficult"
01:57;01:59;"Talk with a colleague"
01:59;02:01;"A child"
02:01;02:03;"Even just a friend"
02:03;02:05;"That's like ""Hey enough horsing around"""
02:05;02:07;"By using the sound effect it kind of puts a smile"
02:07;02:09;"On everybody's face"
02:09;02:11;"So anyway"
02:11;02:13;"I hope nobody has a horse sound phobia"
02:13;02:15;"Because this is a horse meat special"
02:15;02:17;"And we'll be"
02:17;02:19;"Playing a lot of"
02:19;02:21;"Horse sounds but we're not going to get"
02:21;02:23;"Right into the horse meat stuff"
02:23;02:25;"I'd also recognize that I don't think we've ever"
02:25;02:27;"Talked about the fact that we're going to do a horse meat special"
02:27;02:29;"But this has been something that I've always been"
02:29;02:31;"Very interested in"
02:31;02:33;"I don't think I've ever had horse meat"
02:33;02:35;"But I've been curious about it"
02:35;02:37;"Because I know people eat it"
02:37;02:39;"All around the world and I know it's"
02:39;02:41;"Controversial but"
02:41;02:43;"I think it's something we've got to get into"
02:43;02:45;"So we're going to talk a lot about horse meat"
02:45;02:47;"On this episode"
02:47;02:49;"But before that"
02:49;02:51;"How you doing Jake?"
02:51;02:53;"Well"
02:53;02:55;"You're eating horse meat?"
02:55;02:57;"Yeah"
02:57;02:59;"Sorry I'm just catching my breath over here"
02:59;03:01;"We were having some technical difficulties"
03:01;03:03;"So I took the opportunity to eat part of my sandwich"
03:03;03:05;"Drink some brew"
03:05;03:07;"The technical difficulties"
03:07;03:09;"Resolved quicker than I thought"
03:09;03:11;"So you asked me how I was doing"
03:11;03:13;"I'm mid-bite"
03:13;03:15;"You're eating a dinner sandwich?"
03:15;03:17;"Yep"
03:17;03:19;"What kind of sandwich?"
03:19;03:21;"Steak, leftover steak"
03:21;03:23;"Cut up the steak and then what?"
03:23;03:25;"Two slices of bread, a little mayo"
03:25;03:27;"Very minimal"
03:27;03:29;"I just finished work like 5 minutes ago"
03:29;03:31;"And I was like"
03:31;03:33;"It's like 5.53"
03:33;03:35;"I need to clean up here a little bit"
03:35;03:37;"And eat something"
03:37;03:39;"The show starts in 7 minutes"
03:39;03:41;"So you didn't have time to think about flavor profiles"
03:41;03:43;"I gotta get"
03:43;03:45;"It's show time"
03:45;03:47;"When you said steak, do you mean horse steak?"
03:47;03:49;"No it's beef steak"
03:49;03:51;"When I asked you if you'd eaten horse meat"
03:51;03:53;"You said yes"
03:53;03:55;"I almost thought you were implying like duh I'm eating it right now"
03:55;03:57;"Oh yeah like the"
03:57;03:59;"Widely available horse meat"
03:59;04:01;"Steaks that you can just go to Vons and buy"
04:01;04:05;"It's a specialty item"
04:05;04:07;"Well anyway we'll get into that"
04:07;04:09;"But just to paint a picture"
04:09;04:11;"For the listeners at home"
04:11;04:13;"Jake is eating a beefsteak"
04:13;04:15;"Sandwich"
04:15;04:17;"Where you guys grew up"
04:17;04:19;"Is that a phenomenon of a beefsteak dinner?"
04:19;04:21;"Are you guys aware of"
04:21;04:23;"Beefsteak dinners as a thing?"
04:23;04:25;"What is beefsteak?"
04:25;04:27;"As opposed to steak?"
04:27;04:29;"This is a great question"
04:29;04:31;"I was thinking about it"
04:31;04:33;"I think because people used to eat more"
04:33;04:35;"Different types of meat"
04:35;04:37;"You would have to clarify what type of steak you're talking about"
04:37;04:39;"And I think you could have a horse steak"
04:39;04:41;"Beefsteak"
04:41;04:43;"Who knows what else"
04:43;04:45;"So maybe that's why the phrase beefsteak"
04:45;04:47;"Is so old fashioned because in the modern world"
04:47;04:49;"The only steak people are eating is beefsteak"
04:49;04:51;"So it became redundant"
04:51;04:53;"But there was a thing in the town"
04:53;04:55;"I grew up in"
04:55;04:57;"It was kind of analogous to a pancake breakfast"
04:57;04:59;"You know this phenomenon"
04:59;05:01;"Sometimes like at a church"
05:01;05:03;"Or a fire station"
05:03;05:05;"Or a school"
05:05;05:07;"They'll do a pancake breakfast"
05:07;05:09;"On like a Sunday morning"
05:09;05:11;"Where people, the whole town rolls through"
05:11;05:13;"In some community center"
05:13;05:15;"And then they serve pancakes"
05:15;05:17;"And it's a fundraising phenomenon"
05:17;05:19;"You guys aware of this?"
05:19;05:21;"That's a classic thing"
05:21;05:23;"Jake knows about it, Seinfeld, you got it up north"
05:23;05:25;"In Canada?"
05:25;05:27;"Oh yeah, we had that too for sure"
05:27;05:29;"So I think this is analogous"
05:29;05:31;"Where it's kind of like a community oriented type thing"
05:31;05:33;"That's built around"
05:33;05:35;"An easy to serve food"
05:35;05:37;"So it's like a dinner time version of a pancake breakfast"
05:37;05:39;"It's a beefsteak dinner"
05:39;05:41;"In my town"
05:41;05:43;"It's a wrestling team"
05:43;05:45;"This is like a funny association"
05:45;05:47;"With beefsteaks and wrestling"
05:47;05:49;"So it's like"
05:49;05:51;"Beefsteaks eating beefsteak"
05:51;05:53;"Exactly"
05:53;05:55;"And the whole town would come watch the beefsteaks eating the beefsteaks"
05:55;05:57;"And"
05:57;05:59;"I think I went once or twice"
05:59;06:01;"And you go"
06:01;06:03;"And all the wrestlers would be wearing"
06:03;06:05;"A shirt and tie"
06:05;06:07;"Eating beefsteak"
06:07;06:09;"Piled very high on bread"
06:09;06:11;"And I remember all it was"
06:11;06:13;"Was these little pieces of steak on bread"
06:13;06:15;"So there would be a lot of talk about"
06:15;06:17;"How much bread do you consume"
06:17;06:19;"Do you discard the bread and just eat the steak"
06:19;06:21;"Or whatever"
06:21;06:23;"And I think it's an all you can eat type thing"
06:23;06:25;"I remember there would always be like a couple priests there"
06:25;06:27;"It's the type of thing that"
06:27;06:29;"A priest would go to"
06:29;06:31;"Maybe the mayor comes through"
06:31;06:33;"People who want to support the team"
06:33;06:35;"And anyway, that's what a beefsteak dinner is"
06:35;06:37;"And I feel like there's a few"
06:37;06:39;"There's a famous one"
06:39;06:41;"Is it a political thing? A beefsteak dinner?"
06:41;06:43;"Well, there is a"
06:43;06:45;"Tradition of it"
06:45;06:47;"There's one in LA"
06:47;06:49;"That Eric Wareheim"
06:49;06:51;"Partner of"
06:51;06:53;"Tim Heidecker, friend of the show"
06:53;06:55;"Tim and Eric"
06:55;06:57;"He hosts a beefsteak"
06:57;06:59;"Where you dress up very nice"
06:59;07:01;"I think it's like an old New Jersey"
07:01;07:03;"Thing actually"
07:03;07:05;"Or Chicago thing where everyone would get together"
07:05;07:07;"It's very fancy"
07:07;07:09;"It's all you can eat beef and you eat it with your hands"
07:09;07:11;"It's a big part of it"
07:11;07:13;"I think Eric Wareheim"
07:13;07:15;"Because Tim and Eric are both from the greater Philly area"
07:15;07:17;"Which is right next to New Jersey"
07:17;07:19;"So maybe it is kind of a tradition"
07:19;07:21;"So Eric Wareheim"
07:21;07:23;"He invites a lot of, I imagine, Hollywood people"
07:23;07:25;"And comedians"
07:25;07:27;"And dress up"
07:27;07:29;"Which wrestling team is he raising money for?"
07:29;07:31;"The LA Food Bank wrestlers"
07:31;07:33;"No, just the LA Food Bank"
07:33;07:35;"It's originated among the working class"
07:35;07:37;"Of New York in the mid-1800s"
07:37;07:39;"As celebratory meals or testimonials"
07:39;07:41;"The meal would generally be set up"
07:41;07:43;"By an organization wishing to law"
07:43;07:45;"To raise money for politicians, newly promoted"
07:45;07:47;"Friends or celebrities"
07:47;07:49;"Tammany Hall, that was the famous one"
07:49;07:51;"Regularly threw beefsteak dinners"
07:51;07:53;"Yeah, this has some big Tammany Hall"
07:53;07:55;"Energy"
07:55;07:57;"It's a little bit like some Gangs of New York"
07:57;07:59;"Type sh*t"
07:59;08:01;"Like this is probably the first one"
08:01;08:03;"It was at the Five Points"
08:03;08:05;"And Daniel Day Lewis was there"
08:05;08:07;"A lot of scrappy"
08:07;08:09;"Early 19th century New Yorkers"
08:09;08:11;"Get together and eat"
08:11;08:13;"It's from the old weird America"
08:13;08:15;"The beefsteak dinner"
08:15;08:17;"If he mesmerizes"
08:17;08:19;"Each and everyone"
08:19;08:25;"And Lord when he smiles"
08:25;08:27;"The beefsteak becomes well done"
08:27;08:29;"He even makes my grandma"
08:29;08:31;"Feel like she's 21"
08:31;08:33;"Said the boy can't help it"
08:33;08:35;"He was born to please"
08:35;08:37;"Can't help it, just can't help it"
08:37;08:39;"And if I got to go down to him"
08:39;08:41;"On bended knee"
08:41;08:43;"Can't help it, just can't help it"
08:43;08:45;"And if I got to go down to him"
08:45;08:47;"On bended knee"
08:47;08:49;"Can't help it, just can't help it"
08:49;08:51;"And if I got to go down to him"
08:51;08:53;"On bended knee"
08:53;08:55;"Can't help it, just can't help it"
08:55;08:57;"And because I'm hoping"
08:57;08:59;"Obviously"
08:59;09:01;"That someday"
09:01;09:03;"His answer will be"
09:03;09:05;"The boy can't help it"
09:05;09:07;"Cause he's in love with me"
09:07;09:09;"Can't help it, just can't help it"
09:11;09:13;"So just to clarify"
09:13;09:15;"Everybody here knows about pancake breakfast"
09:15;09:17;"But nobody outside of Nick"
09:17;09:19;"Has known or been to a beefsteak dinner"
09:19;09:21;"Yeah I mean the term beefsteak"
09:21;09:23;"Is like the dinners from old weird America"
09:23;09:25;"But we got off on this"
09:25;09:27;"Very obtuse tangent"
09:27;09:29;"Because of the term beefsteak"
09:29;09:31;"Because of the sandwich I'm eating"
09:31;09:33;"I've been to steak dinners"
09:33;09:35;"You're having a beefsteak dinner right now"
09:35;09:37;"The only reason I had to refer to it as beefsteak"
09:37;09:39;"Is your recent obsession with horse meat"
09:39;09:41;"Which I still"
09:41;09:43;"We haven't even gotten to the bottom"
09:43;09:45;"I don't know why we're talking about horse meat this episode"
09:45;09:47;"I'm very curious to see"
09:47;09:49;"How you got on this whole horse meat jag"
09:49;09:51;"On the TC thread for the listeners"
09:51;09:53;"All of a sudden"
09:53;09:55;"The entire thread was horse meat"
09:55;09:57;"And I was like, did I black out?"
09:57;09:59;"Did we talk about"
09:59;10:01;"Horse meat last episode?"
10:01;10:03;"Cause there are periods of the show"
10:03;10:05;"Where I will zone out for a good 10 minutes"
10:05;10:07;"And have no idea what's going on"
10:07;10:09;"And I thought maybe it happened then"
10:09;10:11;"But Ezra just came out of the blue"
10:11;10:13;"And was just like"
10:13;10:15;"Well it's funny"
10:15;10:17;"We're going horse meat"
10:17;10:19;"He sort of soft launched this horse meat thing"
10:19;10:21;"On another thread with me"
10:21;10:23;"Multiple threads"
10:23;10:25;"So I was sort of aware of the horse meat thing"
10:25;10:27;"But I remember thinking to myself"
10:27;10:29;"When I entered the TC thread"
10:29;10:31;"Ezra just said, oh yeah"
10:31;10:33;"We gotta talk about horse meat"
10:33;10:35;"And I was like, did something happen?"
10:35;10:37;"Did Will Smith eat horse meat?"
10:37;10:39;"Something"
10:39;10:41;"Here's how I recall"
10:41;10:43;"I on the thread went"
10:43;10:45;"Hey guys, wouldn't it be cool"
10:45;10:47;"If we talked about Arizona iced tea"
10:47;10:49;"And how their prices haven't changed"
10:49;10:51;"And Ezra was like, we're doing horse meat"
10:51;10:53;"And that's how it started"
10:53;10:55;"And then we were talking about horse meat"
10:55;10:57;"For like hours"
10:57;10:59;"So is the Eric Wareheim dinner"
10:59;11:01;"Referred to as beefsteak?"
11:01;11:03;"So it's a callback to the 19th century"
11:03;11:05;"Full Tammany Hall"
11:05;11:07;"It's not a beefsteak"
11:07;11:09;"No, it is you get dressed up"
11:09;11:11;"It's served in small bites"
11:11;11:13;"You have to call it a beefsteak"
11:13;11:15;"No you can't say steak dinner"
11:15;11:17;"There's no such thing as any dinner that involves steak"
11:17;11:19;"A beefsteak dinner is a specific ritual"
11:19;11:21;"It's cut up"
11:21;11:23;"And it's all you can eat"
11:23;11:25;"And you eat it with your hands"
11:25;11:27;"You know, it's kind of medieval in a way"
11:27;11:29;"It's a feast day"
11:29;11:31;"And I guess also it's a funny mix of some down and dirty"
11:31;11:33;"Just all you can eat steak with your hands"
11:33;11:35;"And I guess Nick, you're saying that at the Eric Wareheim event"
11:35;11:37;"They dress up"
11:37;11:39;"And as I recall"
11:39;11:41;"In my town, the wrestlers would wear shirt and ties"
11:41;11:43;"Yeah"
11:43;11:45;"And the threads are going"
11:45;11:47;"Time Crisis is going to start hosting a horse steak dinner"
11:47;11:49;"And we're going to raise money for"
11:49;11:51;"At risk wrestlers"
11:51;11:53;"Maybe we'll pick a different wrestling team"
11:53;11:55;"That's at risk in some way"
11:55;11:57;"At risk of, I don't know, losing funding"
11:57;11:59;"Or not going to the regional championships"
11:59;12:01;"And we'll raise money for them"
12:01;12:03;"(horse neighing)"
12:03;12:05;"The horse meat thing"
12:05;12:07;"And we'll come back to this throughout the show"
12:07;12:09;"But just because you asked"
12:09;12:11;"For me"
12:11;12:13;"I've always been interested in this school of thought"
12:13;12:15;"A kind of line of reasoning"
12:15;12:17;"That you sometimes hear from"
12:17;12:19;"Passionate animal rights people"
12:19;12:21;"Which is"
12:21;12:23;"Could very well backfire"
12:23;12:25;"But sometimes animal rights people"
12:25;12:27;"And vegan people"
12:27;12:29;"Their heart is in the right place protecting animals"
12:29;12:31;"They sometimes say"
12:31;12:33;"And these people who eat animals"
12:33;12:35;"They eat their cows, they eat their chickens"
12:35;12:37;"They eat their pigs"
12:37;12:39;"But they don't eat horse or dog"
12:39;12:41;"Or cat"
12:41;12:43;"These animals get slaughtered every day in America"
12:43;12:45;"There's all these poor dogs and cats on the street"
12:45;12:47;"Shouldn't these people be eating dog and cat and horse?"
12:47;12:49;"And I've always been interested in that line of reasoning"
12:49;12:51;"Because I wondered if one day"
12:51;12:53;"You know, America might say"
12:53;12:55;"Yes, we'll eat it"
12:55;12:57;"Absolutely"
12:57;12:59;"So I've been interested in that line of reasoning"
12:59;13:01;"I've also been interested in why"
13:01;13:03;"You know, just traveling"
13:03;13:05;"You know, going to Belgium"
13:05;13:07;"In the early days of Vampire Weekend"
13:07;13:09;"We always had a great time"
13:09;13:11;"With our label guy in Belgium"
13:11;13:13;"Jan"
13:13;13:15;"And he would talk about how he enjoyed eating"
13:15;13:17;"Horse steak"
13:17;13:19;"And I feel like he took us to a restaurant"
13:19;13:21;"Maybe he ordered the horse steak"
13:21;13:23;"And I don't think any of us did"
13:23;13:25;"So I was, you know, just broadening my perspectives"
13:25;13:27;"And thinking to myself, hey, where I grew up"
13:27;13:29;"People ate a lot of beefsteak"
13:29;13:31;"But not judging"
13:31;13:33;"Alright, in Belgium, some people like horse meat"
13:33;13:35;"Going to Japan, driving past a horse meat restaurant"
13:35;13:37;"And hearing people talk about"
13:37;13:39;"Oh, I ate horse meat in Japan"
13:39;13:41;"So I've been interested in it"
13:41;13:43;"But the truth is, the reason it was really at the forefront of my mind"
13:43;13:45;"Is that I've had a long-running joke"
13:45;13:47;"With a friend of the show, Morgan"
13:47;13:49;"Who called in the other day"
13:49;13:51;"To talk about"
13:51;13:53;"Explain to us a little bit about royalties"
13:53;13:55;"And how mountain brews can get paid"
13:55;13:57;"From Vampire Weekend"
13:57;13:59;"Covering the song at Red Rocks"
13:59;14:01;"And Morgan's from Kentucky"
14:01;14:03;"I don't know why, one time it popped in my head"
14:03;14:05;"We were maybe just talking about business ideas"
14:05;14:07;"And I said, well you're from Kentucky"
14:07;14:09;"There's a lot of horses there"
14:09;14:11;"And he said yes, and I said, well maybe we should open a horse meat restaurant"
14:11;14:13;"And he said, well I don't know about the legality of that"
14:13;14:15;"And I said, well you know"
14:15;14:17;"I'm an ideas guy"
14:17;14:19;"You're from Kentucky, so you probably got a lot of horse connections"
14:19;14:21;"We could do this"
14:21;14:23;"And I said, we should open one in Echo Park"
14:23;14:25;"Which, if anybody's not familiar"
14:25;14:27;"Is considered a hipster neighborhood of LA"
14:27;14:29;"And I said, we should start with a cool"
14:29;14:31;"Kind of like, a hipster neighborhood"
14:31;14:33;"And he said, we should start with a cool"
14:33;14:35;"Kind of lunch place in Echo Park"
14:35;14:37;"Called Giddy Up, and then do it kind of like"
14:37;14:39;"A classy gastropub called White Horse Tavern"
14:39;14:41;"Somewhere else in town"
14:41;14:43;"And then just from there, I don't know why"
14:43;14:45;"It just stayed in my head"
14:45;14:47;"It's an idea that comes back to me a lot"
14:47;14:49;"That I can't stop thinking of"
14:49;14:51;"Ideas for horse meat restaurants"
14:51;14:53;"And I think I talk about it too much"
14:53;14:55;"I think I've alienated people in my life"
14:55;14:57;"Also there's a"
14:57;14:59;"I think I talked about this on the show"
14:59;15:01;"There's a hot new restaurant in LA"
15:01;15:03;"Called Horses, and you can imagine"
15:03;15:05;"Maybe I hadn't thought about it for a while"
15:05;15:07;"And then everybody starts saying, have you been to Horses?"
15:07;15:09;"And I say, was that a horse meat restaurant?"
15:09;15:11;"And they say, I don't think so"
15:11;15:13;"It's just like a cool new restaurant"
15:13;15:15;"And then I'm back on it"
15:15;15:17;"And I'm thinking about horse meat restaurants"
15:17;15:19;"And I'm coming up"
15:19;15:21;"It's not that I want to eat horse meat"
15:21;15:23;"It's just that I love thinking of"
15:23;15:25;"Concepts for horse meat restaurants"
15:25;15:27;"And it's becoming a little bit of a"
15:27;15:29;"I don't know, an addiction"
15:29;15:35;"Childhood living"
15:35;15:43;"Is easy to do"
15:43;15:51;"The things you wanted"
15:51;15:57;"I bought them for you"
15:57;16:07;"Graceless lady"
16:07;16:13;"You know who I am"
16:13;16:21;"You know I can't let you"
16:21;16:29;"Slide through my hands"
16:29;16:35;"Wild horses"
16:35;16:43;"Couldn't drag me away"
16:43;16:49;"Wild, wild horses"
16:49;16:53;"Couldn't drag me away"
16:53;16:55;"I've texted you guys about it"
16:55;16:57;"Can I share some more of my horse meat restaurant concepts?"
16:57;16:59;"Please"
16:59;17:01;"Well, alright, so I already talked about Giddy Up"
17:01;17:03;"We're going to serve horse and grain bowls"
17:03;17:05;"In Echo Park"
17:05;17:07;"And we're also going to do smoothies with local honey"
17:07;17:09;"So it's going to be a little bit"
17:09;17:11;"That kind of neo-hipster hippy-dippy thing"
17:11;17:13;"Local"
17:13;17:15;"Maybe it's paleo, ancient grains"
17:15;17:17;"Local honey, that kind of thing"
17:17;17:19;"So it's not a horse smoothie"
17:19;17:21;"It's like a normal smoothie"
17:21;17:23;"You just have a horse and the grain bowl"
17:23;17:25;"And then as I discussed, there's White Horse Tavern"
17:25;17:27;"Which is a gastropub with horse steaks and horse burgers"
17:27;17:29;"Truffle hay fries"
17:29;17:31;"Artisanal beer on tap"
17:31;17:33;"And that's going to be in the American Terminal at LAX"
17:33;17:35;"Nice"
17:35;17:37;"It's kind of like, you know, it's an airport place"
17:37;17:39;"But it's classy"
17:39;17:41;"Slim pickings out there, so that's going to be a hit"
17:41;17:43;"That's going to be a hit"
17:43;17:45;"And then I think because we're in LA"
17:45;17:47;"Once it's part of Mexico, famous for great Mexican food"
17:47;17:49;"We need to do a Mexican restaurant"
17:49;17:51;"Called Casa Caballo"
17:51;17:53;"Is that how you say horse in Spanish? Caballo?"
17:53;17:55;"I think so"
17:55;17:57;"It doesn't sound wrong"
17:57;17:59;"Is it Caballo?"
17:59;18:01;"Well, it's an A. It's C-A-B-A-L-L-O"
18:01;18:03;"Oh, okay"
18:03;18:05;"Does that sound right? Caballo?"
18:05;18:07;"Yeah, okay"
18:07;18:09;"So Casa Caballo, horse tacos and fajitas"
18:09;18:11;"Then I had an idea for kind of like a"
18:11;18:13;"Slightly fancier, trendier one"
18:13;18:15;"Called Stallion"
18:15;18:17;"And that's a clubsterant"
18:17;18:19;"From a restaurant I learned recently"
18:19;18:21;"There's a famous place, there's one in West Hollywood"
18:21;18:23;"And there's one in New York"
18:23;18:25;"And there's probably one in Vegas and maybe Miami"
18:25;18:27;"Called Catch"
18:27;18:29;"And it's a big seafood restaurant with really loud music"
18:29;18:31;"And people call it a clubsterant"
18:31;18:33;"Because it has"
18:33;18:35;"It's a restaurant but it has the atmosphere of a club"
18:35;18:37;"So Stallion is a clubsterant"
18:37;18:39;"It's like Catch, except we're doing horse meat"
18:39;18:41;"Instead of seafood"
18:41;18:43;"When I go to a restaurant, I'm always like, I wish it was louder in here"
18:45;18:47;"I mean if there's a great DJ"
18:47;18:49;"I wish the music was worse and it was louder"
18:49;18:53;"Yeah, I mean I think a lot of people feel that way, Jake"
18:53;18:55;"Clearly"
18:55;18:57;"You go out to a restaurant, it's quiet"
18:57;18:59;"It's kind of like embarrassing"
18:59;19:01;"You got awkward pauses and conversation"
19:01;19:03;"People want loud, loud music"
19:03;19:05;"Weird lighting"
19:05;19:09;"And a lot of people yelling"
19:09;19:11;"And then the last idea that I had"
19:11;19:13;"And this unfortunately"
19:13;19:15;"As we'll get into"
19:15;19:17;"Is probably the only one we could actually do"
19:17;19:19;"Is a vegan"
19:19;19:21;"A vegan restaurant called"
19:21;19:23;"Horse of a different color"
19:23;19:25;"And we're going to do impossible horse meat"
19:25;19:27;"Sandwiches there"
19:27;19:29;"And we're going to have a great selection of vegan desserts"
19:29;19:31;"And"
19:31;19:33;"As I'm learning, as I start to try to raise money"
19:33;19:35;"For these restaurants"
19:35;19:37;"And pitch them to restaurateurs"
19:37;19:39;"And things like that"
19:39;19:41;"I've realized that horse meat is"
19:41;19:43;"Not exactly legal in the US"
19:43;19:45;"So unfortunately"
19:45;19:47;"It doesn't really make sense, but we're going to have to start with the vegan one"
19:47;19:49;"Like normally you would start"
19:49;19:51;"By getting people interested in horse meat"
19:51;19:53;"And having these hit horse meat restaurants"
19:53;19:55;"And then you could say"
19:55;19:57;"Well here's something for the vegans"
19:57;19:59;"But we're going to have to do it backwards"
19:59;20:01;"We're going to have to start with impossible horse meat"
20:01;20:03;"And anyway, that's horse of a different color"
20:03;20:05;"It's going to be like really kind of cool"
20:05;20:07;"Alternative vibes"
20:07;20:09;"Like you know, get local artists to do murals on the wall"
20:09;20:11;"Things like that"
20:11;20:13;"[Horse neighing]"
20:45;20:47;"That's the initial"
20:47;20:49;"Horse meat restaurant business plan"
20:49;20:51;"Just to get everybody"
20:51;20:53;"Excited. We'll return to it"
20:53;20:55;"And we can talk about the history of horse meat"
20:55;20:57;"In a little bit"
20:57;20:59;"But before that, we got a really great email"
20:59;21:01;"After talking"
21:01;21:03;"On the last episode about royalties"
21:03;21:05;"Then we were talking a little bit"
21:05;21:07;"With Morgan about"
21:07;21:09;"What he referred to as the black box"
21:09;21:11;"Of music publishing"
21:11;21:13;"Which he said at one point"
21:13;21:15;"Was almost a billion dollars worth of unclaimed royalties"
21:15;21:17;"Just sitting there"
21:17;21:19;"We talked about the fact that"
21:19;21:21;"Alright, it's very unlikely"
21:21;21:23;"That Bruce Springsteen"
21:23;21:25;"Is leaving like 40 million dollars on the table"
21:25;21:27;"He's got a team of"
21:27;21:29;"Managers, lawyers, whoever"
21:29;21:31;"Who are out there vacuuming up all the nickels and dimes"
21:31;21:33;"What do you think?"
21:33;21:35;"Who's contributing to this billion dollars of"
21:35;21:37;"Unclaimed royalties in the black box?"
21:37;21:39;"It's going to be people"
21:39;21:41;"And families"
21:41;21:43;"Who just don't even"
21:43;21:45;"Know that it's there"
21:45;21:47;"Somebody who wrote a song a long time ago"
21:47;21:49;"Let's say the family"
21:49;21:51;"Of a musician who died"
21:51;21:53;"And these are people who, again"
21:53;21:55;"Maybe they're not missing a million dollars"
21:55;21:57;"But"
21:57;21:59;"They might be missing enough money that it could make a difference"
21:59;22:01;"In their life or help them out in a tough time"
22:01;22:03;"So anyway, we got an email"
22:03;22:05;"That's exactly that type of story"
22:05;22:07;"From a guy named Andrew Neely"
22:07;22:09;"Let's go to the time crisis mailbag"
22:09;22:11;"Howdy dudes"
22:11;22:13;"Your recent music industry episode"
22:13;22:15;"Reminded me that my best friend's"
22:15;22:17;"Stepdad got a sizable"
22:17;22:19;"Payout. He's my best"
22:19;22:21;"Friend's stepdad"
22:21;22:23;"My best friend's stepdad got a"
22:23;22:25;"Sizable payout from the black box"
22:25;22:27;"Of music publishing that helped him out in a"
22:27;22:29;"Really material way. This is what we're talking"
22:29;22:31;"About man. Ray"
22:31;22:33;"My bud's stepdad"
22:33;22:35;"Isn't that just such a good stepdad name?"
22:35;22:37;"Ray? It's perfect"
22:37;22:39;"Hey Ray"
22:39;22:41;"You know you could call me dad"
22:41;22:43;"Man. It's cool Ray. I like calling you"
22:43;22:45;"Ray. All good buddy"
22:45;22:47;"Dude your stepdad is so cool"
22:47;22:49;"Oh man. Ray's the man"
22:49;22:51;"And Ray actually is. Sounds"
22:51;22:53;"Very cool. So Ray"
22:53;22:55;"The bud's stepdad was a"
22:55;22:57;"Has been a hardworking musician for 50 plus years"
22:57;22:59;"And he was in a rad jazz"
22:59;23:01;"Fusion band called Flying Island"
23:01;23:03;"That I think you guys would enjoy. And I checked them out"
23:03;23:05;"And I do enjoy them"
23:05;23:07;"And they're like ""If you do a bogus deal with Vanguard"
23:07;23:09;"They never saw a penny"""
23:09;23:11;"So this is one of these stories. Damn Vanguard"
23:11;23:13;"Yeah you think Vanguard would be a little"
23:13;23:15;"That's like a well known label. You think would have been"
23:15;23:17;"Yeah. A little more above board"
23:17;23:19;"And I checked out Flying Island"
23:19;23:21;"Like you wanna throw on a little Flying Island Matt?"
23:21;23:23;"Yeah I wanna hear it. It's cool"
23:23;23:25;"It's like um"
23:25;23:27;"You know it's got a little bit of like Maha Vishnu orchestra"
23:27;23:29;"There's like a violin"
23:29;23:31;"It's pro. It's like cool"
23:31;23:33;"70's progressive"
23:33;23:35;"With a violin. Hell yeah"
23:35;23:49;"What year did this come out by the way?"
23:49;23:51;"We know it's the 70's. Love to know the actual year"
23:51;23:55;"This is 1976"
23:55;24:01;"Like already I just like"
24:01;24:03;"This"
24:03;24:19;"Like if I knew somebody and they're like"
24:19;24:21;"""Hey you wanna hear my new band?"""
24:21;24:23;"And they played me this I'd be like ""You guys are great"""
24:23;24:25;"This is excellent"
24:25;24:27;"Yeah I'm not hearing"
24:27;24:29;"So far I'm not hearing really like"
24:29;24:31;"Jazz fusion it sounds to me more like"
24:31;24:33;"Yeah like"
24:33;24:35;"In Rainbows or something. Oh yeah"
24:35;24:37;"Just kinda rock"
24:37;24:39;"Yeah actually so far it's very modern. You're right this could be like"
24:39;24:41;"Like some like Chicago like slowcore band"
24:41;24:43;"Yeah"
24:43;24:45;"Oh yeah totally"
24:45;24:57;"Okay now we're getting a little more harmonically complex"
24:57;24:59;"Yeah now it's like a touch of like"
24:59;25:01;"A little bit of like Matheny type guitar"
25:01;25:03;"I like just the"
25:03;25:05;"Solo unaccompanied guitar"
25:05;25:09;"Oh here we go"
25:09;25:25;"Hmm"
25:25;25:27;"I wonder what Ray did in this band"
25:27;25:29;"I mean I think Ray might have been the guitarist"
25:29;25:31;"It's a little bit unclear"
25:31;25:33;"Okay"
25:33;25:35;"I'm really just enjoying listening to this"
25:35;25:37;"Yeah"
25:37;25:39;"Did you mention that you were the guitarist"
25:39;25:41;"I'm not sure"
25:41;25:43;"I'm not sure if you were the guitarist"
55:29;55:31;"I'm not sure if it's illegal to eat horse meat"
01:13:13;01:13:19;"Although couldn't you see like a funny like Tucker Carlson segment on Frankie Biden?"
01:13:19;01:13:23;"Like Hunter Biden style like the president's brother"
01:13:23;01:13:25;"Yeah enough already with the Hunter Biden we're talking about Frankie Biden"
01:13:25;01:13:29;"No I can totally picture Tucker Carlson just being like"
01:13:29;01:13:34;"And while you may not enjoy eating horse meat, me personally I prefer beefsteak"
01:13:34;01:13:38;"What gives you the right to tell your fellow American that they cannot eat this?"
01:13:38;01:13:45;"Is it because the Biden crime family decided that no longer shall any American eat this?"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"Is this what America is becoming?"
01:13:47;01:13:50;"That one person can ban this type of meat?"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"Well hold on a second, really think about it"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"Is that the America you want to live in?"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"There's nothing about meat in the constitution"
01:13:56;01:14:01;"Bernie co-sponsored the Safeguard American Food Exports Act"
01:14:01;01:14:04;"Which would prohibit the slaughter of horse for meat"
01:14:04;01:14:10;"So Sanders is very decidedly anti-horse meat"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"Pro-horse, anti-horse meat"
01:14:13;01:14:17;"Well hey you, what's the matter you"
01:14:17;01:14:20;"Can't do all the things that we used to do"
01:14:20;01:14:27;"And it sucks, and it's bad"
01:14:27;01:14:33;"And who's a good boy, what's the killjoy"
01:14:33;01:14:38;"Got some money now we're fighting over new toys"
01:14:40;01:14:43;"Isn't it sad"
01:14:43;01:14:49;"I'm sitting in my usual chair"
01:14:49;01:14:53;"Feeling the walls around me closing"
01:14:53;01:14:57;"I'm in a state of disrepair"
01:14:57;01:15:01;"I try to make it till the morning"
01:15:01;01:15:07;"It's not enough, it's not enough"
01:15:08;01:15:13;"Every single day I'm on the ground"
01:15:14;01:15:18;"Horses don't seem like"
01:15:18;01:15:22;"Also like the most efficient kind of vehicle for"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"Raising a lot of meat"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"They're very slender animals"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"I still wouldn't think that"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"In the years that it takes to raise a horse"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"You're just not going to get"
01:15:32;01:15:34;"A lot of bang for your buck"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"Which is kind of a disgusting way to look at it"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"Maybe part of the issue is that"
01:15:38;01:15:41;"In America we do use horses for so much"
01:15:41;01:15:44;"We watch them race, they pull our carriages"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"So much"
01:15:46;01:15:50;"So there are a lot of horses in America"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"So maybe part of the issue is that"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"Are there horses being slaughtered"
01:15:54;01:15:57;"And that meat could have gone towards"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"Feeding the hungry"
01:15:59;01:16:01;"Is it an issue like that?"
01:16:01;01:16:03;"Because again, I said this at the beginning"
01:16:03;01:16:05;"I've seen this argument before"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"Where sometimes pedotypes will say"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"All these dogs and cats get put down all the time"
01:16:09;01:16:11;"If people want to eat meat, they should eat that"
01:16:11;01:16:13;"People say this"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"And I don't know what the counter argument is"
01:16:15;01:16:17;"That's an interesting argument"
01:16:17;01:16:20;"And then you'd also just get into the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness thing"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"You'd just get somebody like Seinfeld"
01:16:22;01:16:25;"He comes from a country, in a city, where people eat horse meat"
01:16:25;01:16:27;"That might have emotional connections to him"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"That might have a cultural resonance to him"
01:16:29;01:16:33;"And the idea that there could be enough horses in America"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"To at least supply"
01:16:35;01:16:38;"One kind of hipster LA restaurant"
01:16:38;01:16:41;"Where a guy like Seinfeld can go and eat horse meat"
01:16:41;01:16:44;"That, you know, it's not ruining your life that you can't have it"
01:16:44;01:16:46;"But it's like, when you"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"You know, the aroma, the taste"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"Brings you back"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"These are, you know, food is culture"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"Food is emotional for people"
01:16:54;01:16:58;"I feel like this is a misrepresentation of my own relationship with horse meat"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"And I want to distance myself"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"No judgment to anybody who does consume horse meat"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"I just want to sort of, you know"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"I don't know why you're backpedaling"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"I mean, you know, I wasn't pedaling anywhere"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"No, but seriously, Seinfeld"
01:17:10;01:17:14;"So you're saying there are still multiple Montreal horse meat restaurants functioning right now?"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"That's what your research is showing?"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"That's what my calculations were showing"
01:17:18;01:17:21;"Can you pull up the menu on one of those?"
01:17:21;01:17:23;"Yeah, give us some more info on one of these"
01:17:23;01:17:25;"Like, are we getting steaks?"
01:17:25;01:17:27;"Are we getting, like, uh"
01:17:27;01:17:30;"Well, Jake and I have had a similar experience"
01:17:30;01:17:33;"I think we may be the only two then on here"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"If Seinfeld's telling the truth"
01:17:35;01:17:37;"That have eaten horse meat"
01:17:37;01:17:39;"And we both ate it in Japan"
01:17:39;01:17:41;"Separately, separate trips"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"I would love to go to Japan with you, Nick"
01:17:43;01:17:45;"It's the same"
01:17:45;01:17:47;"Horse meat date"
01:17:47;01:17:49;"But I was served at an Omoka Pasta restaurant"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"Like course number seven"
01:17:51;01:17:53;"They brought out"
01:17:53;01:17:55;"And I really didn't know, you know"
01:17:55;01:17:57;"They don't really, sort of, don't know what you're eating"
01:17:57;01:17:59;"But they brought out horse carpaccio"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"So, just thinly sliced raw meat"
01:18:01;01:18:03;"Just thinly sliced raw horse"
01:18:03;01:18:05;"This is raw"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"And is it, what, they squeeze some lemon on it?"
01:18:07;01:18:09;"It's like Italian"
01:18:09;01:18:11;"Some lemon and pepper, yeah"
01:18:11;01:18:13;"Was it similar to beef carpaccio?"
01:18:13;01:18:15;"Very, and it was good"
01:18:15;01:18:17;"It is, it's a little bit sweeter"
01:18:17;01:18:19;"I mean, the idea is a bit, maybe, sort of"
01:18:19;01:18:21;"Unsettling or off-putting at first"
01:18:21;01:18:23;"But it was very good"
01:18:23;01:18:25;"And it was one of those situations where"
01:18:25;01:18:27;"It was very small dining"
01:18:27;01:18:29;"And I just felt like, oh, I have to eat this"
01:18:29;01:18:31;"I wanted nothing to do with it"
01:18:31;01:18:33;"But she also didn't want to look like her plate was full"
01:18:33;01:18:35;"So I had to eat all of hers, too"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"And so it was really an overload"
01:18:37;01:18:39;"So it looked like we had cleaned the plate"
01:18:39;01:18:41;"And then later I was talking"
01:18:41;01:18:43;"To a friend of mine in Japan"
01:18:43;01:18:45;"I said, where do they get it? And he said, oh, it's interesting"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"And this is similar to what we've now discovered"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"Which is"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"That it is such a delicacy"
01:18:51;01:18:53;"And it is so expensive"
01:18:53;01:18:55;"Typically there, because"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"They bring in the"
01:18:57;01:18:59;"Horses from North Carolina"
01:18:59;01:19:01;"Or wherever, they have to ship the horses"
01:19:01;01:19:03;"There, and then they're"
01:19:03;01:19:05;"And then they have to slaughter them in Japan"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"Yeah, and that's a trip"
01:19:07;01:19:09;"Yeah, moving live horses"
01:19:09;01:19:11;"I mean, I wonder if they're flying them"
01:19:11;01:19:13;"Probably, by some weird"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"Animal cargo plane"
01:19:15;01:19:17;"Oh, God"
01:19:17;01:19:19;"That's so heavy"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"Jake, you also ate horse meat in Japan"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"Did you fly to Japan just to do that?"
01:19:23;01:19:25;"No, I was there"
01:19:25;01:19:27;"I was there"
01:19:27;01:19:29;"20 years ago"
01:19:29;01:19:31;"On tour with the American indie pop band"
01:19:31;01:19:33;"Dear Nora"
01:19:33;01:19:35;"Oh yeah, friend of the show"
01:19:35;01:19:37;"Friend of the show, Katie"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"Yeah, we were at a sushi train kind of place"
01:19:39;01:19:41;"You know, where there's the"
01:19:41;01:19:43;"Carousel kind of going around"
01:19:43;01:19:45;"You can pick dishes"
01:19:45;01:19:47;"And it's all fish and stuff"
01:19:47;01:19:49;"And then I remember there was one dish"
01:19:49;01:19:51;"That kept passing me by that was like"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"Just blood red"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"Just like the deepest"
01:19:55;01:19:57;"Burgundy"
01:19:57;01:19:59;"Like just, and then there was like"
01:19:59;01:20:01;"The chef standing there, and I was like, what is that?"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"And he goes, horse"
01:20:03;01:20:05;"And I was like, alright, well, one in Rome, one in Tokyo"
01:20:05;01:20:07;"And honestly"
01:20:07;01:20:09;"I don't really remember it"
01:20:09;01:20:11;"I mean, it was just sort of like rich"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"Kind of like meaty"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"Yeah, there may have been like a sauce on it"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"I honestly don't really remember it"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"You know it's never easy"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"To even try to please"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"Me"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"Sometimes I'm such a tease"
01:20:25;01:20:27;"And sometimes I'm a liar"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"I've seen you get frustrated"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"I've seen you aggravated"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"I've seen you agitated too"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"It's so easy to take the blame"
01:20:35;01:20:37;"When everything I do comes back again"
01:20:37;01:20:39;"And I have no idea"
01:20:39;01:20:41;"What I'm doing"
01:20:41;01:20:43;"And I'm not even sure"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"What I'm doing"
01:20:45;01:20:47;"And I'm not even sure"
01:20:47;01:20:49;"What I'm doing"
01:20:49;01:20:51;"When everything I do comes back again"
01:20:51;01:20:53;"And I haven't felt the same, my friend"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"Since you went away"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"All those times I made you cry"
01:20:57;01:20:59;"And I didn't have an alibi"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"There are things I can't deny"
01:21:01;01:21:03;"Since you went away"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"Away"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"It is funny that you can eat venison"
01:21:19;01:21:21;"In America"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"Because I've had venison"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"At least once or twice"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"And actually, can I just do a quick poll here"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"Are you guys grossed out by the idea of eating venison?"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"Honestly, yeah"
01:21:31;01:21:33;"I have a very unadventurous palate"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"And so I'm a little grossed out by it"
01:21:35;01:21:37;"By anything that's not horse"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"Seinfeld is a very unadventurous palate"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"Anything outside of horse"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"He's like, ""Ugh!"""
01:21:43;01:21:45;"A lot of people consider chicken"
01:21:45;01:21:47;"Is a regular"
01:21:47;01:21:49;"Kind of regular thing in Seinfeld"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"But this is interesting"
01:21:51;01:21:53;"I'm seeing chicken through your eyes"
01:21:53;01:21:55;"It's just like a horse meat guy"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"The feathers"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"The beak"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"This pale, weird color"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"I can see how for a horse meat guy"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"Like you, chicken is gross"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"And that's what's interesting about this whole conversation"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"Is that everybody has a different POV"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"You know, I'm starting to feel like a horse myself"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"Because I'm being branded"
01:22:13;01:22:15;"I'm being branded"
01:22:15;01:22:17;"Somebody who enjoys horses"
01:22:17;01:22:19;"And I just want to dispel that notion"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"I just want to, you know"
01:22:21;01:22:23;"Get that rumor, you know"
01:22:23;01:22:25;"De-circulated"
01:22:25;01:22:27;"You were asking about"
01:22:27;01:22:29;"How a horse was prepared in Montreal"
01:22:29;01:22:31;"And I'm looking at an article"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"From Montreal Eater"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"So a lot of these restaurants"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"This is from 2014"
01:22:37;01:22:39;"From what I can tell are defunct"
01:22:39;01:22:41;"But a couple are still in business"
01:22:41;01:22:43;"I'm seeing, there's a horse burger"
01:22:43;01:22:45;"That was served at a restaurant called Brisket's"
01:22:45;01:22:47;"I'm seeing"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"A lot of"
01:22:49;01:22:51;"Horse tartare"
01:22:51;01:22:53;"So that's raw again"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"Right"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"There's a lot of raw horse being eaten in this world"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"Yeah, for sure"
01:22:59;01:23:01;"And then it's a restaurant called Tripes and Caviar"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"That serves horse marrow"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"Snails and morello cherries"
01:23:05;01:23:07;"Jesus Christ"
01:23:07;01:23:09;"What the hell is the name of that restaurant again?"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"Tripes and what?"
01:23:11;01:23:13;"It's called Tripes and Caviar"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"Jesus Christ"
01:23:15;01:23:17;"Tripes and Caviar in Montreal"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"That kind of makes me think of, there's a pet store"
01:23:19;01:23:21;"In Burbank called Scales and Tails"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"Oh, I spend a lot of time at Scales and Tails"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"Oh, you go to Scales and Tails?"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"Once a week"
01:23:27;01:23:29;"Open up a restaurant in Montreal called Scales and Tails"
01:23:29;01:23:31;"And then finally there's one here called Joe Beef"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"And Joe Beef still seems to be in operation"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"Oh, Joe Beef is a famous"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"Oh, I know Joe Beef is a famous restaurant"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"I've been there too"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"They serve horse?"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"They serve horse and Joe Beef?"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"At Joe Beef in Montreal, they serve a bacon wrapped"
01:23:45;01:23:47;"Tornado"
01:23:47;01:23:49;"Of horse, that's like a fillet"
01:23:49;01:23:51;"With beef frank and foie gras sauce"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"So I mean you gotta have a real"
01:23:53;01:23:55;"Rare find"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"No, Joe Beef is like an influential, beloved restaurant"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"I've never been there, but I've heard a lot about it"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"Oh wow"
01:24:01;01:24:03;"People who are really into food will be like, oh Joe Beef in Montreal, that's a great restaurant"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"Oh, Joe Beef serves horse"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"They gotta open a Joe Horse"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"*horse neighing*"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"Alright, well I think we learned a lot about horse meat"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"I'm still not interested in horse meat myself"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"But uh"
01:24:15;01:24:17;"You are interested in the business of horse meat"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"I'm interested in the business side and"
01:24:19;01:24:21;"I do think the vegan argument is compelling"
01:24:21;01:24:23;"If you're gonna eat animals"
01:24:23;01:24:25;"Like what are these bizarre lines you're drawing"
01:24:25;01:24:27;"I can see from"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"It's really not hard to understand the point of view of somebody's like"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"I don't wanna eat any animals"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"And then somebody's like, well"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"Yeah, you're not gonna catch me eating horse"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"But I would eat all these other"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"The vegan perspective, it's like"
01:24:39;01:24:41;"What are you saying man?"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"It doesn't make sense"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"We've talked about um"
