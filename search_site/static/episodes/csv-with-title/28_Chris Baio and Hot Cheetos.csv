00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, October."
00:05;00:11;"This week we dig deeper than ever into the corporate food industrial complex."
00:11;00:17;"We talk to Chris Baio from Vampire Weekend about the snack foods that shaped his life."
00:17;00:21;"We talk to Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Michael Moss."
00:21;00:27;"Seinfeld 2000 stops by, plus the top five."
00:27;00:30;"And a little snack called Hot Cheetos."
00:30;00:33;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:33;00:37;"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sporting One."
00:37;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:43;00:50;"They were a pal to a believer, all my rightful chances"
00:50;00:57;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:57;01:04;"And so I dealt to the floor, when the boss had to go"
01:04;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:15;01:19;"Leave it on me babe"
01:19;01:23;"Time Crisis, episode 3000."
01:23;01:27;"Back here in Culver City, California with my co-host Jake."
01:27;01:28;"What's up Jake?"
01:28;01:29;"Hey."
01:29;01:33;"It's a new year in the Jewish calendar."
01:33;01:34;"That's right."
01:34;01:35;"You're familiar?"
01:35;01:36;"I am."
01:36;01:37;"I went to a uh, Rosh Hashanah?"
01:37;01:38;"Yeah."
01:38;01:39;"Is that the right?"
01:39;01:40;"I don't know."
01:40;01:41;"Yeah."
01:41;01:42;"It took me a second to pronounce that."
01:42;01:44;"I always said more like Rosh Hashanah, but I don't know."
01:44;01:46;"That's just the New Jersey pronunciation."
01:46;01:50;"I went to a Rosh Hashanah potluck, because my special lady friend is Jewish."
01:50;01:54;"So you're learning a lot about the Jewish religion and culture and customs?"
01:54;01:56;"Yeah, actually kind of, a little bit."
01:56;01:58;"So do you know what year it is in the Jewish calendar?"
01:58;02:01;"Um, it's like 5000 or something?"
02:01;02:04;"It's 5777."
02:04;02:06;"Wow, it's so specific."
02:06;02:11;"Yeah, it's deep, because I remember that my Bar Mitzvah was in 5757."
02:11;02:15;"In the year 5757."
02:15;02:19;"Exactly, about almost, it'll be, my 20 year anniversary will be coming up soon."
02:19;02:22;"There's many calendars in the world."
02:22;02:27;"There's the Jewish calendar, the Roman calendar, the Mayan calendar."
02:27;02:29;"Wait, so we're on the Roman calendar, right?"
02:29;02:30;"Yeah."
02:30;02:33;"Okay, so wait, what year is it? 2016?"
02:33;02:34;"It's 2016."
02:34;02:41;"So the Jewish calendar and the Roman calendar are 3040 years off?"
02:41;02:43;"Yeah, 3500 roughly."
02:43;02:44;"Wow."
02:44;02:48;"So at the Rosh Hashanah celebration, did you eat an apple with honey?"
02:48;02:50;"No, bread."
02:50;02:51;"With honey?"
02:51;02:52;"Yeah."
02:52;02:53;"What does that symbolize?"
02:53;02:54;"That's some red wine."
02:54;02:56;"Um, I don't remember."
02:56;02:59;"It's the new year, and you eat something sweet because?"
02:59;03:01;"You're partying?"
03:01;03:03;"Well, almost."
03:03;03:05;"It's nutrients?"
03:05;03:07;"It's new year, so you're looking forward to the year ahead."
03:07;03:08;"Yeah."
03:08;03:11;"So you eat something sweet, so."
03:11;03:12;"I'm missing the link here."
03:12;03:15;"I mean, you could eat something salty, you could eat something fatty."
03:15;03:17;"I mean, you could eat whatever you want."
03:17;03:21;"I mean, I like a big plate of nachos on New Year's Day."
03:21;03:26;"Well, okay, in the Jewish tradition, you eat something sweet, usually with honey,"
03:26;03:29;"on the Jewish New Year's because you want to have a sweet year."
03:29;03:31;"Okay, so it's that literal."
03:31;03:32;"It's very straight up."
03:32;03:34;"I mean, this is some old stuff."
03:34;03:36;"It's not very creative."
03:36;03:40;"It's weird, though, that 5700 years ago, that sweet, they were like,"
03:40;03:42;"""Yeah, we want to have a sweet year."
03:42;03:44;"We're going to have sweet food."""
03:44;03:48;"Because I picture 5700 years ago, life was rough, and it would be like,"
03:48;03:51;"sweet food, salty food, whatever."
03:51;03:53;"We're pumped, we're eating food."
03:53;03:54;"Right."
03:54;03:55;"You know what I mean?"
03:55;03:57;"Not going to split hairs, really."
03:57;04:00;"And who knows when they really started the honey tradition."
04:00;04:02;"I don't know if that's, like, in the Bible or anything."
04:02;04:03;"Right."
04:03;04:06;"Yeah, no, back in the day, I think, depending what part of the world you were from,"
04:06;04:09;"you might not have tasted sweet stuff that often."
04:09;04:10;"Right."
04:10;04:11;"Can you imagine that?"
04:11;04:18;"Like, what American kid is ever more than a few minutes and 50 cents away"
04:18;04:20;"from some disgusting sweet thing?"
04:20;04:23;"Back in the day, if you lived in, like, Europe,"
04:23;04:26;"before they started colonizing the world and, like, growing sugar"
04:26;04:29;"and bringing it back to the mother country,"
04:29;04:31;"you might not have sweet stuff that often."
04:31;04:34;"It's not like there is just fruit all over the place."
04:34;04:38;"Dude, my grandmother, who's from Connecticut and was born, I guess,"
04:38;04:41;"in, like, the teens, I remember her telling me that when she was a kid,"
04:41;04:45;"she'd get an orange in her Christmas stocking."
04:45;04:47;"Because, you know, oranges were only in Florida,"
04:47;04:50;"and they were a big pain in the ass to get up to New England."
04:50;04:51;"It was expensive to ship up to Connecticut."
04:51;04:52;"Absolutely."
04:52;04:54;"So an orange on Christmas morning was, like, a big deal."
04:54;04:55;"God, that's brutal."
04:55;04:58;"That makes me just so sad."
04:58;05:01;"I remember her telling me that in the '80s when I was, like, freaking out"
05:01;05:05;"because I didn't get the right He-Man character in, like, 1984 or whatever."
05:05;05:07;"Don't come here."
05:07;05:10;"Yeah, she was like, ""Let me just drop some knowledge on you."""
05:10;05:12;"She wasn't even doing it in, like, a harsh way."
05:12;05:14;"She was just like, ""Yo, when I was a kid,"
05:14;05:16;"getting an orange on Christmas day was a big deal."""
05:16;05:19;"You were, like, digging in a bag of Jolly Ranchers, and you were just like--"
05:19;05:22;"Grandma, who ate all the grape ones?"
05:22;05:23;"Are you kidding me?"
05:23;05:25;"There's no grape Jolly Ranchers in here."
05:25;05:29;"She was like, ""Jake, for Christmas, I used to get one orange."""
05:29;05:30;"Yeah."
05:30;05:32;"And that was the one orange I would have for the year."
05:32;05:34;"It really, like, made an impact on me."
05:34;05:36;"That's a cool grandma, man."
05:36;05:38;"But again, here on ""Time Crisis,"""
05:38;05:41;"we really have to extend our condolences to all the people"
05:41;05:45;"who grew up in a time when you couldn't have everything you want."
07:25;07:28;"Can you imagine if you had given someone in, like, the 1930s,"
07:28;07:31;"like, some Gatorade or something?"
07:31;07:34;"I guess they had Coca-Cola back then."
07:34;07:39;"Let's talk about your grandma as a little girl in the teens in Connecticut."
07:39;07:42;"What do you think is the product that would, like, blow her mind the most,"
07:42;07:44;"the food product?"
07:44;07:46;"Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
07:46;07:48;"Yeah, imagine going back to the '30s."
07:48;07:50;"The entire Doritos line."
07:50;07:51;"Yeah."
07:51;07:53;"Man, imagine that."
07:53;07:54;"That's a cool idea."
07:54;07:59;"We should pitch a movie that's like a Jaken Ezra time travel movie--"
07:59;08:00;"Bill and Ted's."
08:00;08:04;"--where we go back to Depression-era New England,"
08:04;08:06;"find our teenage grandmas,"
08:06;08:10;"and just lace them with Hot Cheetos just to, like, brighten their day."
08:10;08:11;"What's up, Grandma?"
08:11;08:13;"What's up, Grandma?"
08:13;08:15;"I know it's been a rough decade,"
08:15;08:18;"but we just go down to, like, the corner store"
08:18;08:20;"and just, like, throw in a bunch of, like, Ho-Hos and Twinkies,"
08:20;08:22;"and it's just like--"
08:22;08:23;"I got it."
08:23;08:26;"It's Christmas 1932."
08:26;08:30;"You and I have one hour that we can go back in time."
08:30;08:34;"We got to find both our grandmas in New York and Connecticut,"
08:34;08:39;"and we just brighten their Christmas day with some modern food products."
08:39;08:42;"These strange men showed up"
08:42;08:48;"and gave us this, like, orange cardboard-like material."
08:48;08:51;"They told us to eat it, but we didn't trust them."
08:51;08:56;"Lemon-lime Gatorade, some blueberry pie Oreos."
08:56;09:00;"So that's a perfect lead-in because we're going to be talking a lot about food products today."
09:00;09:01;"Yeah, we are."
09:01;09:06;"We talk about it a lot on ""Time Crisis,"" but we're really doing our research today."
09:06;09:10;"We're going to get into some real talk about food products."
09:10;09:15;"We're going to have an expert named Michael Moss a little bit later."
09:15;09:18;"He's a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist"
09:18;09:21;"who's kind of like a food industry muckraker."
09:21;09:23;"He's going to drop some real knowledge on us."
09:23;09:25;"We're also going to have Chris Baio."
09:25;09:26;"Oh!"
09:26;09:30;"From the excellent hit band Vampire Weekend, three albums in stores now."
09:30;09:31;"Who?"
09:31;09:32;"He's going to--"
09:32;09:34;"He plays bass in a group called Vampire Weekend."
09:34;09:37;"They have three albums in stores. I'm going to gift them to you on iTunes."
09:37;09:40;"He's in L.A., so he's going to come through and chat,"
09:40;09:42;"maybe drop some of his own knowledge on snack foods."
09:42;09:45;"And also, we're going to dig in the mailbag a little bit later"
09:45;09:48;"because I love that people are finding your email somehow"
09:48;09:52;"and sending you just deep food product stories."
09:52;09:53;"Oh, yeah."
09:53;09:55;"And you got a really good one about Hot Cheetos."
09:55;09:56;"So we're going to be talking about that."
09:56;09:58;"So we've got Hot Cheetos, Chris Baio, Michael Moss"
09:58;10:01;"all coming up on this week's ""Time Crisis."""
10:01;10:04;"This is ""Time Crisis"" Jewish New Year."
10:04;10:05;"Let's have a sweet year."
10:05;10:07;"What's a sweet song to play for everybody"
10:07;10:11;"to wish all of our listeners, Jewish and otherwise, a sweet year?"
10:11;10:15;"One song I've been really into recently is ""Bugler"" by the Byrds."
10:15;10:17;"""Bugler"" by the Byrds?"
10:17;10:19;"Yeah, the band the Byrds. The song's called ""Bugler."""
10:19;10:21;"All right, this better be sweet."
10:21;10:24;"Back when Cattle Creek used to sing"
10:24;10:28;"Its waters were sweet and its banks were green"
10:28;10:34;"And sunny days went on forever"
10:34;10:38;"Me and old Bugler, we went wild"
10:38;10:41;"Blue-tech hound and a redneck child"
10:41;10:51;"We thought we were birds of a feather"
10:51;10:54;"Ah, the fish would bite, my, how they'd bite"
10:54;10:58;"We'd catch them parsons in the pale moonlight"
10:58;11:04;"But not just to please her"
11:04;11:08;"Bugler's voice, my Gabriel's home"
11:08;11:11;"Up from the cypress and down through the corn"
11:11;11:18;"The golden sound, yes, he treasured"
11:18;11:21;"Bugler, Bugler, bless your hide"
11:21;11:24;"Jesus gonna take you for a cherry ride"
11:24;11:30;"Say goodbye, say goodbye"
11:30;11:48;"(instrumental)"
11:48;11:51;"One day, love, she brought the news"
11:51;11:55;"She said, ""Honey, old Bugler's done paid his dues"
11:55;12:02;"He's been hit down, he's on that highway"
12:02;12:05;"Dry your eyes and stand up straight"
12:05;12:08;"He was gonna place a pretty case"
12:08;12:15;"Say goodbye, sugar, oh, say goodbye"
12:15;12:18;"Bugler, Bugler, bless your hide"
12:18;12:22;"Jesus gonna take you for a cherry ride"
12:22;12:28;"Say goodbye, say goodbye"
12:28;12:32;"Bugler, Bugler, bless your hide"
12:32;12:35;"Jesus gonna take you for a cherry ride"
12:35;12:41;"Say goodbye, oh, say goodbye"
12:41;13:10;"(instrumental)"
13:11;13:14;"That was ""The Birds of Bugler,"" Jake's pick"
13:14;13:17;"for a sweet Jewish New Year's gem."
13:17;13:20;"We are now joined in the studio by Chris Baio."
13:20;13:21;"What's up, Chris?"
13:21;13:23;"What's up? Good to be here."
13:23;13:25;"Yeah, man. Welcome to ""Time Crisis."""
13:25;13:26;"Hell yeah, thank you."
13:26;13:29;"So you're here in L.A. You just got in from London."
13:29;13:31;"I did yesterday, last night."
13:31;13:34;"So, man, today we're mostly talking about snack foods"
13:34;13:36;"and corporate food products."
13:36;13:37;"Okay, yeah, yeah."
13:37;13:38;"Just gonna get right into it."
13:38;13:39;"Let's do it."
13:39;13:40;"You and I know each other pretty well."
13:40;13:41;"We don't need a small talk."
13:41;13:42;"No, no."
13:42;13:45;"So one question I have for you is,"
13:45;13:47;"you're definitely a snacker."
13:47;13:49;"Yeah, I'm a serious snacker."
13:49;13:52;"You're a snacker, but you also like to exercise."
13:52;13:53;"It's true."
13:53;13:54;"You're a walking contradiction."
13:54;13:55;"It is true, yeah."
13:55;13:57;"So basically, you're living in another country."
13:57;14:00;"I'm sure that the snack options change."
14:00;14:02;"So I'm curious, if you just kind of walk us through"
14:02;14:05;"your entire life with some of the corporate food products"
14:05;14:09;"that kind of mark time for you and how that's changed"
14:09;14:11;"living in a different country."
14:11;14:12;"Oh, wow."
14:12;14:15;"Do beverages count as snacks, or are we really talking food?"
14:15;14:18;"No, beverages count, and the more loaded with sugar, the better."
14:18;14:21;"You know that thing they do on Pitchfork called--"
14:21;14:23;"5, 10, 15, 25."
14:23;14:26;"Where you pick the song that represented your life?"
14:26;14:27;"We're doing that with snack foods."
14:27;14:29;"So right now you're 31."
14:29;14:30;"I'm 31, yeah."
14:30;14:31;"Oh, this is perfect."
14:31;14:32;"Okay."
14:32;14:35;"So 5 years old, what was the snack that meant a lot to you?"
14:35;14:38;"I have a very distinct memory."
14:38;14:42;"I was born in Manhattan, and when I was 5 years old,"
14:42;14:47;"we moved from Manhattan to the suburbs to Bronxville, New York."
14:47;14:53;"And I just remember it was after all the stuff had been moved out of our apartment."
14:53;14:57;"We were just sitting on the floor, and I was drinking a Yoo-Hoo."
14:57;14:59;"It was really, really good."
14:59;15:02;"It stood out enough that I can remember it 26 years later."
15:02;15:06;"Yoo-Hoo is an interesting one because a lot of fools out there call it chocolate milk."
15:06;15:07;"It's not?"
15:07;15:10;"No, it's a chocolate drink."
15:10;15:11;"Do some research, man."
15:11;15:13;"You would have fooled me."
15:13;15:17;"Next time you're in the supermarket, pull out a Yoo-Hoo and look at what it says."
15:17;15:21;"It says a chocolate drink because it's not milk."
15:21;15:22;"There's some milk in it."
15:22;15:24;"All right, Yoo-Hoo, that's a great one."
15:24;15:26;"What about at age 10?"
15:26;15:28;"Okay, age 10, you know, I'm in the burbs."
15:28;15:32;"I'll transition out of beverages, but I'm having a tough time going back."
15:32;15:39;"Just beverages are coming to mind, and the drink Clearly Canadian was something that I would have very consistently."
15:39;15:43;"I would have maybe like a bacon, egg, and cheese on a bagel and a Clearly Canadian"
15:43;15:46;"if I really wanted to go for it on a Saturday."
15:46;15:50;"And I guess the Clearly Canadian would be kind of like the snack portion of the meal."
15:50;15:54;"Now, Clearly Canadian, that was a clear soda?"
15:54;15:56;"Yeah, and it was very, very artificial."
15:56;16:00;"I mean, I feel like-- Is it like a 7-Up?"
16:00;16:04;"No, the flavors were a bit more experimental."
16:04;16:08;"I think you would find like maybe two or three different fruits in it."
16:08;16:09;"Like a raspberry?"
16:09;16:11;"It would be like raspberry, blueberry."
16:11;16:17;"I feel like it was kind of marketed towards like middle-class moms who were like too good just to pound a Fanta."
16:17;16:18;"Right?"
16:18;16:20;"Wasn't it like a little bit like a cut above?"
16:20;16:21;"Maybe."
16:21;16:25;"I would go to-- shout out to Lang's Delicatessen of Bronxville, New York."
16:25;16:29;"It's still standing, but that was where I would get my Clearly Canadians."
16:29;16:31;"Six-pack can?"
16:31;16:32;"No!"
16:32;16:33;"Or a clear bottle?"
16:33;16:35;"No, I would have one clear bottle."
16:35;16:36;"No, no, no, no."
16:36;16:37;"Is it sold in a six-pack?"
16:37;16:41;"You think I'd just chug a six-pack of Clearly Canadian on a Saturday afternoon?"
16:41;16:46;"I actually love that image of like kids pounding soda like the way like frat dudes pound beer."
16:46;16:47;"With a beer bong?"
16:47;16:48;"Just consecutive."
16:48;16:49;"Just like--"
16:49;16:50;"I think there's probably something there."
16:50;16:54;"I think probably-- I was just thinking about this reading Bruce Springsteen's memoirs."
16:54;17:00;"So there's a part where Bruce describes his childhood in New Jersey, and I love how he's written it so far."
17:00;17:06;"And he talks about his father working down at the factory and coming home, and he describes the six-pack ritual."
17:06;17:09;"Just coming home, just classic American dad."
17:09;17:15;"Sitting at the table, still in his work clothes, and just pounding one after another, one, two, three, four, five, six."
17:15;17:18;"Hitting the sack, waking up, going down to work, doing it all again."
17:18;17:25;"And I wonder if in a way there's kind of like a thing that you're an American kid, and dad comes home, busts through a six-pack,"
17:25;17:30;"and you kind of get started busting through a six-pack of Coke or Sprite."
17:30;17:31;"Arguably worse for you."
17:31;17:37;"Early in the morning, factory whistle blows."
17:37;17:43;"Man rises from bed and puts on his clothes."
17:43;17:49;"Man takes his lunch, walks out in the morning light."
17:49;17:55;"The working, the working, just the working life."
17:55;18:01;"Through the mansions of fear, through the mansions of pain,"
18:01;18:07;"see my daddy walking through them factory gates in the rain."
18:07;18:12;"Factory takes his ear, factory gives him life."
18:12;18:18;"The working, the working, just the working life."
18:43;18:48;"And of the day, factory whistle cries."
18:48;18:54;"Men walk through these gates with death in their eyes."
18:54;19:00;"And you just better believe, boy, somebody's gonna get her tonight."
19:00;19:05;"The working, the working, just the working life."
19:05;19:12;"'Cause it's the working, the working, just the working life."
19:12;19:13;"All right, so age 15."
19:13;19:14;"What year were you born, '85, right?"
19:14;19:16;"'84, '84, October '84."
19:16;19:17;"Oh, right."
19:17;19:18;"Happy birthday, man."
19:18;19:20;"Coming up. It's coming up."
19:20;19:21;"Oh, wow."
19:21;19:22;"Yeah, I feel it."
19:22;19:23;"All right, so you were 15 in '99."
19:23;19:24;"Yeah."
19:24;19:27;"I'm gonna go the warheads, atomic warheads."
19:27;19:28;"Oh, yeah."
19:28;19:33;"And I would just pound them until my skin sort of like started peeling."
19:33;19:38;"And like, in my tongue, the like skin on my tongue would just all fall apart."
19:38;19:43;"Now, for maybe either our younger listeners or our older listeners"
19:43;19:47;"or our listeners who are our age who are not familiar with--"
19:47;19:49;"I don't know if they had warheads everywhere."
19:49;19:50;"What is an atomic warhead?"
19:50;19:52;"Describe the sensation to somebody who's never had one."
19:52;19:54;"It's pleasure mixed with pain."
19:54;19:57;"It's like very, very tangy, and it kind of burns on your tongue,"
19:57;20:01;"but it's like a little hard candy, but it's like a little drop of hard candy,"
20:01;20:04;"and it's like a bit dusted on it."
20:04;20:05;"Have you had them?"
20:05;20:06;"No."
20:06;20:07;"Oh, really?"
20:07;20:08;"Yeah, I love those."
20:08;20:09;"So it's like you suck on it."
20:09;20:10;"It's like super sour."
20:10;20:16;"When you first put it in your mouth, it's like a little tangier than sucking a lemon."
20:16;20:17;"Yeah, yeah."
20:17;20:20;"It's like that level of tanginess."
20:20;20:21;"You make a face."
20:21;20:22;"It's like crazy."
20:22;20:23;"It's intense."
20:23;20:24;"And then it gets sweet."
20:24;20:26;"Actually, I didn't have it for like years and years."
20:26;20:29;"I feel like I wouldn't see it in bodegas in New York or whatever,"
20:29;20:32;"but I remember actually when I came out here when we were working on"
20:32;20:35;"Modern Vampires of the City, I saw it."
20:35;20:38;"I was really back into warheads during those sessions,"
20:38;20:42;"and I definitely like my tongue up very early on in the sessions."
20:42;20:43;"Oh, my God."
20:43;20:46;"Those are good, and from time to time I'll still partake."
20:46;20:47;"Wow."
20:47;20:49;"All right, age 20."
20:49;20:50;"2004."
20:50;20:51;"All right, 2004."
20:51;20:52;"Wow."
20:52;20:53;"You were at Columbia."
20:53;20:54;"I was at Columbia."
20:54;20:57;"I think sour Skittles were definitely on the market by then."
20:57;20:58;"Oh, yeah."
20:58;21:01;"Ooh, just even hearing the word sour Skittles, I felt it in my mouth."
21:01;21:04;"Living in London, one of the big disappointments is that I think"
21:04;21:07;"the sour Skittles of America would be illegal over there,"
21:07;21:08;"so they changed the formula."
21:08;21:10;"It's not like all dusted."
21:10;21:12;"It's just kind of a little bit tangy, whereas the sour--"
21:12;21:13;"Wait, why would it be illegal?"
21:13;21:16;"Is there legislation against sour snacks?"
21:16;21:19;"I think it's probably a bit too artificial would be my guess."
21:19;21:20;"Ah."
21:20;21:22;"So there wouldn't be atomic warheads over there either."
21:22;21:24;"No, they have more like Haribo."
21:24;21:27;"I mean, we'll get to 30 in due time."
21:27;21:28;"Okay."
21:28;21:30;"But they'll have like a Reese's Pieces."
21:30;21:31;"Oh, yeah."
21:31;21:32;"Okay."
21:32;21:33;"That seems pretty insanely concocted too."
21:33;21:35;"But like they don't have like Fruity Pebbles."
21:35;21:36;"Whoa."
21:36;21:38;"Well, that's because it's a breakfast food, not a snack."
21:38;21:39;"Right."
21:39;21:42;"That's because it's a socialist nanny state,"
21:42;21:44;"and I just want to say to everybody over in England,"
21:44;21:48;"if you want to come over to America, eat some Fruity Pebbles sour Skittles."
21:48;21:49;"Up on a plane."
21:49;21:50;"All right."
21:50;21:52;"Age 25, 2009."
21:52;21:54;"Okay, 2009."
21:54;21:55;"Where am I?"
21:55;21:57;"I think you're living in Greenpoint probably."
21:57;21:58;"Yeah, living in Greenpoint."
21:58;22:01;"The thing is I was really on the sour Skittles for so long,"
22:01;22:03;"but I can't recycle."
22:03;22:05;"So in your life, well, I guess you can."
22:05;22:06;"So you're like this."
22:06;22:07;"Now when they do 10, 20."
22:07;22:09;"The sour Skittles got their hooks in you."
22:09;22:11;"What about outside the candy realm?"
22:11;22:13;"You eat chips, you have like a Cape Cod chip."
22:13;22:15;"I'll do like Doritos."
22:15;22:16;"I have Doritos."
22:16;22:17;"I don't want to force it on you."
22:17;22:18;"No, I do."
22:18;22:19;"No, no, no."
22:19;22:20;"I do."
22:21;22:22;"I like Doritos."
22:22;22:23;"I want to ask a more specific question."
22:23;22:25;"So you're age 25, living in Greenpoint."
22:25;22:27;"Now you're an adult."
22:27;22:30;"You're shopping for yourself probably more than you had previously in life."
22:30;22:36;"What's like the illest, grossest thing that you would like buy at the store and bring home?"
22:36;22:41;"It would probably be like spicy nacho Doritos, which it's been interesting to watch now."
22:41;22:45;"I feel like Doritos have been getting more and more experimental and crazy."
22:45;22:49;"And like the Doritos aren't as good in England as they are over here,"
22:49;22:51;"but they'll be like these crazy--"
22:51;22:58;"Have you seen the like chili habanero lime Doritos where it's like a little cone"
22:58;23:00;"and it's really, really crunchy?"
23:00;23:01;"Oh."
23:01;23:03;"I've only started noticing it in the last like two years."
23:03;23:05;"Is it like a bugle?"
23:05;23:07;"It's bugle-esque in shape."
23:07;23:08;"Okay."
23:08;23:11;"But it's really, really spicy."
23:11;23:14;"It must be an interesting time to be like a Doritos flavor scientist"
23:14;23:16;"and try and come up with new options."
23:16;23:19;"You're always trying to like top your last invention."
23:19;23:21;"They're the rock stars now."
24:06;24:15;"Isra Canings' Time Crisis."
24:15;24:16;"Just to rewind for a second."
24:16;24:17;"Yeah, yeah, okay, Greenpoint."
24:17;24:20;"So age 25, you're living in Greenpoint."
24:20;24:23;"You're like rolling to the key foods to just stock up,"
24:23;24:28;"and you just go through the snack aisle and just see like a spicy--"
24:28;24:30;"you buy like the big one?"
24:30;24:32;"From time to time, yeah, yeah, definitely."
24:32;24:33;"So you'd be like--"
24:33;24:35;"The most shameful, it would be like getting that"
24:35;24:38;"and then getting like a ranch dip and dip it."
24:38;24:39;"Yeah, I know."
24:39;24:41;"Ranch dip, it is-- yeah, yeah."
24:41;24:42;"Were you single at this point?"
24:42;24:46;"No, I was with the person I eventually married and I'm still married to."
24:46;24:49;"So, you know."
24:49;24:51;"Would she partake or this was like--"
24:51;24:53;"No, this is truly despicable."
24:53;24:54;"These are Bayo snacks."
24:54;24:56;"Yeah, truly despicable."
24:56;24:58;"And would you like get home, put the groceries away,"
24:58;25:01;"and just immediately like go through the whole bag with the dip?"
25:01;25:02;"No, I wouldn't get--"
25:02;25:04;"She'd be like, ""Chris, you ready to start making dinner?"""
25:04;25:06;"Be like, ""Um, I had a late lunch."""
25:06;25:07;"I had a late lunch."
25:07;25:09;"[laughter]"
25:09;25:13;"She comes home, PlayStation's on pause, you're passed on the couch."
25:13;25:15;"Just like a ring of orange."
25:15;25:20;"Yeah, jeans open, like the fly down, passed out."
25:20;25:22;"All right, so that was age 25."
25:22;25:23;"Okay."
25:23;25:27;"Age 30, which was not that long ago."
25:27;25:30;"I got really into more recently--"
25:30;25:32;"it's all about the Haribo in England,"
25:32;25:35;"and there's these Minions branded Haribo."
25:35;25:36;"Wait, what's Haribo? Sorry."
25:36;25:38;"It's like gummy candy."
25:38;25:41;"It's sour and they're in the shape of Minions,"
25:41;25:44;"so they're like yellow and blue, and they're pretty good."
25:44;25:47;"I'll have like a beer and Minions to take the itch off a tough guy."
25:47;25:49;"Beer and sour candy?"
25:49;25:50;"That's a thing, man."
25:50;25:51;"Jesus."
25:51;25:52;"It works really well."
25:52;25:54;"So for our American listeners,"
25:54;25:57;"that's basically the equivalent of pounding a bud"
25:57;26:00;"and then grabbing a handful of Sour Patch Kids?"
26:00;26:01;"Yeah."
26:01;26:03;"When you're in America, would you do that?"
26:03;26:04;"Bud and Sour Patch Kids?"
26:04;26:06;"Sure, a bud and a Sour Skittles."
26:06;26:09;"Candy and alcohol seems so weird to me."
26:09;26:11;"It really works. You've got to try it, man."
26:11;26:13;"I've definitely experienced it at like--"
26:13;26:16;"when you're at somebody's weird office party."
26:16;26:18;"Or like somebody has a Halloween party and you're starving,"
26:18;26:20;"and you're drinking a beer, and then you're like,"
26:20;26:23;"""Uh, is there like a taco truck nearby?"""
26:23;26:24;"It's like, ""No."""
26:24;26:25;"And it's like, ""Um, okay."""
26:25;26:27;"And the next thing you know, you ate like 10--"
26:27;26:28;"Mini Snickers?"
26:28;26:30;"Mini Snickers, drinking a beer."
26:30;26:31;"Okay, I've done that."
26:31;26:32;"It's not a good feeling."
26:32;26:35;"I remember one time I had a crazy layover in the Dallas airport."
26:35;26:36;"Just turned 21."
26:36;26:38;"I remember having four-- I don't know why I did this--"
26:38;26:40;"ate four full-size Snicker bars."
26:40;26:41;"Oh!"
26:41;26:43;"And a pint of like bud."
26:43;26:44;"Nice."
26:44;26:45;"All-American."
26:45;26:46;"It was disgusting."
26:46;26:47;"I mean--"
26:47;26:50;"I guess you were really susceptible to that Snickers advertising."
26:50;26:52;"I love that they were just like--"
26:52;26:53;"Oh, it satisfies."
26:53;26:55;"Yeah, no, but also remember, ""Hungry? Why wait?"""
26:55;26:58;"The idea was that somebody was like starving,"
26:58;27:01;"and then rather than eating something like healthy,"
27:01;27:03;"it would always be like Snickers."
27:03;27:05;"They really branded Snickers as like-- it's not just a candy."
27:05;27:06;"It's a meal."
27:06;27:07;"It's a meal. It's sustenance."
27:07;27:09;"It'd be like those early construction guys"
27:09;27:11;"with like an iron I-beam on their shoulder,"
27:11;27:13;"just like wailing on a Snickers."
27:13;27:15;"[laughter]"
27:15;27:16;"Oh, man."
27:16;27:19;"[♪♪♪]"
27:19;27:34;"So, Chris, thank you for walking us through your life and snacks."
27:34;27:37;"In general, do you eat healthier now?"
27:37;27:38;"Yeah, definitely."
27:38;27:42;"I'll try and go for a banana when I feel that urge for sour Skittles."
27:42;27:44;"It's been kind of what I've been placing it with."
27:44;27:45;"A banana?"
27:45;27:46;"Yeah."
27:46;27:47;"Great food."
27:47;27:48;"You guys like bananas?"
27:48;27:49;"Hell yeah."
27:49;27:50;"Very filling."
27:50;27:53;"Yeah, I like running, and so usually if I'm really hungry beforehand,"
27:53;27:56;"just have that banana, then I'm good."
27:56;27:57;"That's a classic pre-run food."
27:57;27:58;"It's great."
27:58;27:59;"Is it banana?"
27:59;28:01;"You get that potassium, you get that sugar."
28:01;28:02;"Yeah."
28:02;28:03;"Don't you feel like bananas are unreliable?"
28:03;28:04;"No."
28:04;28:05;"I like bananas."
28:05;28:08;"I like the taste, but then so often I'll peel a banana,"
28:08;28:11;"and it's like too hard or like the flavor's not right."
28:11;28:13;"You don't know what's under the peel until you peel it."
28:13;28:14;"Yeah, exactly."
28:14;28:15;"Okay."
28:15;28:19;"What would you say is the most consistent fruit?"
28:19;28:21;"That's a tough one."
28:21;28:23;"That's a great question."
28:23;28:25;"Most consistent fruit."
28:25;28:28;"Granny Smith apple."
28:28;28:31;"That is probably the most sour Skittles-y of all the fruits."
28:31;28:34;"Yeah, maybe next time you want sour Skittles, you should have a Granny Smith."
28:34;28:40;"Now, to be fair, I picked Granny Smith apple because when you bite into a Granny Smith apple,"
28:40;28:42;"all you're expecting is sour."
28:42;28:46;"Whenever you get a Granny Smith in the life cycle, it's going to more or less have the same flavor,"
28:46;28:52;"whereas another type of apple--you know, Red Delicious for a sweet apple are fairly consistent."
28:52;28:57;"I'm not up on my apple game like you are in terms of judging between the different varietals."
28:57;28:58;"I usually go Fuji."
28:58;28:59;"I don't know why."
28:59;29:00;"That's a good one."
29:00;29:04;"I would say I think that peaches are a real handful."
29:04;29:05;"I love peaches."
29:05;29:11;"I love a good peach, but how often do you eat a peach and it's just perfect?"
29:11;29:14;"Or nectarine, any of the stone fruits?"
29:14;29:15;"You know what I mean, man?"
29:15;29:16;"You're a tough customer."
29:16;29:18;"Why? Because I like good food?"
29:18;29:19;"I'm a foodie."
29:19;29:20;"No, I'm really not a foodie."
29:20;29:22;"Maybe I am a fruity."
29:22;29:27;"It's important to me that fruit is tasty and not mealy."
29:27;29:29;"Blueberries are also very inconsistent."
29:29;29:30;"Yeah, I got your back on that."
29:30;29:32;"Yeah, blueberries are all over the place."
29:32;29:35;"Okay, well, how many times have you picked blueberries, Jake?"
29:35;29:36;"Many."
29:36;29:37;"Put in a number."
29:37;29:38;"80."
29:38;29:40;"[laughter]"
29:40;29:42;"Growing up, we had a blueberry patch."
29:42;29:43;"In your house?"
29:43;29:44;"Yeah, backyard."
29:44;29:45;"On the estate?"
29:45;29:46;"Yep."
29:46;29:48;"Okay, well, I've picked blueberries more than 80 times."
29:48;29:53;"And I remember as a kid being in upstate New York with my family,"
29:53;29:56;"and my sister can attest to this, we went blueberry picking,"
29:56;30:01;"and then we were back at the rental house eating the blueberries,"
30:01;30:03;"and I was, like, giving her blueberries."
30:03;30:06;"Let's say she was 4 and I was 8, and I remember--"
30:06;30:08;"this is maybe just a mean big brother thing,"
30:08;30:10;"but I remember, like, picking up a blueberry,"
30:10;30:14;"and I could tell it was, like, very soft and watery,"
30:14;30:18;"and then I fed it to her, and I remember she gagged and almost threw up,"
30:18;30:20;"and it really made an impact on her."
30:20;30:21;"So Emma--"
30:21;30:22;"Damn."
30:22;30:23;"Sorry about that."
30:23;30:25;"But anyway, maybe this was a formative experience for me."
30:25;30:26;"Jesus."
30:26;30:29;"I saw the pain that I put a beloved family member through"
30:29;30:31;"by feeding them a soft blueberry,"
30:31;30:33;"and I realized just how disgusting fruit is."
30:33;30:35;"Actually, I think Emma doesn't really eat fruit."
30:35;30:36;"What?"
30:36;30:37;"Oh, my God."
30:37;30:39;"What have I done?"

31:19;31:24;"So, Chris, you've been talking a lot about your love of sour snacks,"
31:24;31:28;"which I think you know you probably should curb."
31:28;31:29;"Yeah, definitely."
31:29;31:32;"I had a real wake-up call, actually."
31:32;31:35;"There's a movie theater up the road for me,"
31:35;31:36;"and they have pick-and-mix, right?"
31:36;31:39;"So you get the bag, and you just put as much as you want."
31:39;31:40;"Oh, you get, like, the little shovel?"
31:40;31:41;"Yeah, you get the little shovel."
31:41;31:44;"You put in as much as you want, and on three separate occasions,"
31:44;31:47;"three different people were like, ""You know, you can put some back if you want to."""
31:47;31:48;"Oh, my God."
31:48;31:51;"So I am trying to curb it a bit."
31:51;31:54;"I've been in L.A. for 24 hours."
31:54;31:57;"I haven't had any gummy candy, so--"
31:57;31:58;"Are you Jones?"
31:58;32:00;"I am. I got that itch. Yeah."
32:00;32:01;"I just think, like you said,"
32:01;32:04;"there's something a little bit scary about that artificial sour stuff."
32:04;32:05;"Oh, yeah."
32:05;32:07;"I mean, I don't know if it's any worse for you than the sugar,"
32:07;32:09;"but there's something freaky about it."
32:09;32:14;"No, it's definitely something that I need to really, you know, have a long, hard think about."
32:14;32:15;"It tastes so good."
32:15;32:17;"So you've always lived an extreme lifestyle."
32:17;32:18;"Absolutely."
32:18;32:22;"You love super sour stuff, Warheads, and you also love really hot stuff."
32:22;32:23;"That's true, yes."
32:23;32:28;"So actually, we were all together after we did the Bernie Sanders rally in New York."
32:28;32:29;"That's right."
32:29;32:34;"We went back to your friend's crib, and we ordered some buffalo wings."
32:34;32:36;"And I believe they came in--"
32:36;32:37;"Four separate flavors."
32:37;32:38;"It was like a flight, kind of."
32:38;32:44;"I think there was like mild, medium, hot, and then one was called crazy, I think."
32:44;32:45;"Yes, it was."
32:45;32:52;"And nobody at the celebration could even have one crazy wing."
32:52;32:57;"And yet you basically pounded the entire crazy category."
32:57;33:00;"I probably had 15 crazy wings."
33:00;33:04;"And granted, we put in a lot of hard work that day, so I was really hungry by the end."
33:04;33:07;"But, yeah, I was just having straight crazies."
33:07;33:13;"So you can just eat brutally hot stuff, and it doesn't bother you?"
33:13;33:15;"It's like a good kind of hurt, you know, the burn."
33:15;33:19;"I just can't necessarily describe it other than that I like the hurt of it,"
33:19;33:21;"and I like the extremeness of it."
33:21;33:25;"I've only met my match in terms of spiciness twice in my life."
33:25;33:29;"One was actually a very early Vampire Weekend show in Boston."
33:29;33:32;"My sister, who was living there at the time, took me to a burrito place,"
33:32;33:35;"and usually I'll just order the spiciest thing."
33:35;33:37;"It just lit up inside me."
33:37;33:43;"I felt so terrible, and my stomach was kind of like a war zone for the rest of the day."
33:43;33:44;"Was that pre-show?"
33:44;33:48;"Absolutely, and I felt so, so bad on stage."
33:48;33:50;"I didn't know if I was going to make it."
33:50;33:53;"I think I was--I mean, like, in general I tend to sweat,"
33:53;33:56;"but I think I was kind of drenched in sweat before we started playing."
33:56;33:58;"Oh, no."
33:58;34:00;"Where were we playing, the Middle East?"
34:00;34:03;"No, no, no, we were playing at the Modern Art Museum that's connected to the museum school."
34:03;34:04;"Do you remember that show?"
34:04;34:05;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
34:05;34:10;"That's like by far the worst I've ever felt on stage in my entire life, just from that burrito."
34:10;34:12;"So one burrito just ruined your day."
34:12;34:16;"Yeah, and I will say I respect this place for beating me,"
34:16;34:21;"but this place is no longer standing, and I'm still alive, so I outlasted it."
34:21;34:23;"They didn't take you down."
34:23;34:25;"I outlasted the place."
34:25;34:28;"So do you like hot snacks?"
34:28;34:31;"Yeah, like the chili lime habanero Doritos."
34:31;34:35;"They really do pack a punch, and I do kind of think that, like,"
34:35;34:38;"that need of the flavor scientists to keep going further--"
34:38;34:41;"like, do you remember there was that New Yorker article on the Carolina Reaper,"
34:41;34:45;"like how they're just trying to make peppers spicier and spicier?"
34:45;34:48;"What do you think you're going to find at your local gas stations,"
34:48;34:50;"like spicier and spicier snacks?"
34:50;34:52;"Because I think that there is a real interest out there for it."
34:52;34:53;"Until somebody dies."
34:53;34:59;"Yeah, I read about some snack brand was making Carolina Reaper potato chips."
34:59;35:01;"Okay, I'm really interested because I was--"
35:01;35:02;"Okay, here's the thing."
35:02;35:03;"You get one chip."
35:03;35:04;"What?"
35:04;35:05;"It comes in a box."
35:05;35:07;"It's so spicy that it comes--"
35:07;35:08;"How big is the chip?"
35:08;35:11;"I think, like, you know, you know how big chips are."
35:11;35:12;"I am."
35:12;35:13;"How much does it cost?"
35:13;35:14;"No, it's one chip."
35:14;35:15;"Is it really expensive?"
35:15;35:16;"I think it's probably--"
35:16;35:18;"Like, 99 cents but for one chip?"
35:18;35:19;"I don't know."
35:19;35:21;"Maybe it's like $4.99 and comes in, like, a commemorative box"
35:21;35:23;"and you get, like, a sticker or decal or something."
35:23;35:24;"I would love to try it."
35:24;35:27;"No, but it's one normal-sized chip that's so spicy"
35:27;35:30;"that they legally can't give you more than one."
35:30;35:34;"Listen, next time I'm in town coming through for time crisis,"
35:34;35:37;"I want to eat one of them on mic."
35:37;35:38;"Oh, on air?"
35:38;35:39;"Yeah."
35:39;35:40;"Oh, my God."
35:40;35:41;"That'd be great radio."
35:41;35:42;"[laughter]"
35:42;35:47;"Just--Jake and I just--we'll have to get some thesauruses out"
35:47;35:50;"just using vivid language to describe your face."
35:50;35:51;"Yeah, definitely."

37:16;37:20;"Well, so, do you know what the most famous hot snack food in America is?"
37:20;37:22;"Maybe you forgot 'cause you live in London."
37:22;37:23;"No, yeah, what would you say?"
37:23;37:24;"It's Hot Cheetos."
37:24;37:26;"Oh, okay. Flamin' hot."
37:26;37:27;"Flamin' hot Cheetos."
37:27;37:31;"There's a whole family now within Cheetos of the hot stuff."
37:31;37:33;"So thanks for walking us through all that, Chris."
37:33;37:36;"You're welcome to stay because we're about to dig in the mailbag."
37:36;37:40;"So, for all of the real intrepid Time Crisis heads"
37:40;37:44;"who do some hardcore Googling and can find one of Jake's emails,"
37:44;37:49;"they sometimes email Jake with some deep facts on corporate food history."
37:49;37:52;"And this week, Jake really got a doozy."
37:52;37:53;"Yeah."
37:53;37:56;"So, Jake, you want to read this one about Hot Cheetos?"
37:56;38:01;"Got an email from a guy named Alec Richards in the Midwest."
38:01;38:05;"Kind of a vague reference, but..."
38:05;38:09;"And he wrote me a story about the origins of Flamin' Hot,"
38:09;38:14;"which I found so unbelievable that I actually Googled it to verify."
38:14;38:17;"To me, the invention of the Flamin' Hots is just as interesting"
38:17;38:19;"as the subculture that it has followed."
38:19;38:24;"In 1976, a Frito-Lay janitor by the name of Richard Montanez"
38:24;38:28;"took home some Cheetos that had improper coating of cheese dusting"
38:28;38:30;"due to an assembly line malfunction."
38:30;38:32;"He took these faulty Cheetos home"
38:32;38:36;"and experimented with some spicy concoctions heavy on the chili powder."
38:36;38:39;"Story goes that with some prodding from his family,"
38:39;38:43;"Montanez took up the idea with some of the bigwigs at Frito-Lay"
38:43;38:46;"and the Flamin' Hot Cheeto line was born."
38:46;38:50;"Montanez has since gone on to become a huge success story within the company."
38:50;38:52;"And actually, I looked that up and it's true."
38:52;38:56;"Okay, so Flamin' Hot Cheetos were invented by a janitor."
38:56;38:57;"Yep."
38:57;39:00;"So this is almost like some goodwill hunting type scenario,"
39:00;39:02;"like Matt Damon--"
39:02;39:03;"Genius."
39:03;39:06;"Just a low-key genius working as a janitor at Harvard."
39:06;39:10;"At the end of the day, he solves the math problem"
39:10;39:13;"that the snooty professor left up on the wall."
39:13;39:18;"And in this instance, we have a janitor working at the Frito-Lay company"
39:18;39:24;"and some bonehead on the assembly line improperly coats--"
39:24;39:25;"Cheese dust."
39:26;39:27;"The term is cheese dust."
39:27;39:30;"There was a cheese dust malfunction and they're like,"
39:30;39:32;"""Well, I guess we're just going to have to toss these."""
39:32;39:37;"And this humble genius janitor is like, ""Hey, I'll take them if they're edible."""
39:37;39:39;"And he's like, ""All right, man."
39:39;39:43;"I don't know why you'd want some improperly cheese dust-coated Cheetos."""
39:43;39:47;"But so this guy takes them home and he basically cracks the problem."
39:47;39:49;"How do you make Cheetos better?"
39:49;39:51;"How do you take Cheetos to the next level?"
39:51;39:56;"He does something that all these fancy MBA-having Frito-Lay executives"
39:56;39:57;"couldn't figure out."
39:57;40:00;"Well, first of all, I want to say that's an amazing story,"
40:00;40:05;"and I'm also glad that this guy didn't get screwed because I could totally imagine--"
40:05;40:09;"imagine the movie version of this where it's like the janitor comes in,"
40:09;40:11;"he's like, ""Hey, guys, I was just kind of fooling around at home"
40:11;40:12;"and I made something really good."
40:12;40:14;"Me and my family have really been enjoying it."""
40:14;40:19;"And then just like the slimy Harvard MBA Frito-Lay executive is like,"
40:19;40:25;"""Oh, America is not ready for a flaming hot Cheeto, but let me just take those."""
40:25;40:27;"And he really shouldn't have taken those home in the first place"
40:27;40:29;"and then like totally cuts them out."
40:29;40:31;"But he's been a success. He's been promoted."
40:31;40:32;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
40:32;40:33;"That's good. That's good."
40:33;40:35;"Yeah, yeah. Worked out for him."
40:35;40:38;"But yeah, in your fantasy, smash cut to him in the grocery aisle"
40:38;40:42;"turning the corner in the huge end cap display of his vision, flaming hot Cheetos."
40:42;40:45;"And then he's like talking to his family like, ""How do I take on Frito-Lay?"""
40:45;40:49;"And then they're like--they see like a bus ad for like John Turturro"
40:49;40:53;"as like the fly-by-night criminal lawyer."
40:53;40:55;"And then together they thought--"
40:55;40:59;"Now listen, man, I get people off for petty crimes."
40:59;41:03;"You're talking about taking on one of the biggest snack food companies in the world."
41:03;41:06;"I love this. I'm going to write some--what's his name?"
41:06;41:07;"Richard Montanez."
41:07;41:11;"I'm going to write some Richard Montanez, John Turturro fan fiction later."
41:11;41:15;"All right, so there's some more facts in this email about flaming hot Cheetos?"
41:15;41:20;"Well, sort of. Fast forward 36 years and enter YN Rich Kids."
41:20;41:21;"That's a rap group."
41:21;41:24;"Yeah, a group of preteen rappers from Minneapolis."
41:24;41:28;"These kids loved hot Cheetos and another spicy snack, Takis, so much."
41:28;41:29;"Takis."
41:29;41:31;"Oh, my bad. My bad."
41:31;41:37;"So much that they created a rap song which currently has more than 13 million views on YouTube."
41:37;41:41;"It's pronounced YN Rich Kids?"
41:41;41:43;"It's a nonprofit out of Minneapolis."
41:43;41:46;"It's like an after-school thing to help kids be creative and stuff?"
41:46;41:47;"Yeah."
41:47;41:49;"Wow, and it produced like a low-key hit song."
41:49;41:51;"Do you know this song?"
41:51;41:52;"No, I don't know. Do you know it?"
41:52;41:55;"Yeah, I vaguely remember when it came out."
41:55;41:56;"Let's listen."
41:56;41:57;"Should we do it?"
41:57;42:00;"Yo."
42:00;42:03;"I go by the name of Dane Jones."
42:03;42:06;"I'm with my crew."
42:06;42:08;"And we going to show y'all what we be snacking on."
42:08;42:09;"You dig?"
42:09;42:10;"I'm gang."
42:10;42:11;"Hot Cheetos and Takis."
42:11;42:13;"Hot Cheetos and Takis."
42:13;42:16;"I can't get enough of these hot Cheetos and Takis."
42:16;42:19;"Got my fingers stained red and I can't lie, get up on me."
42:19;42:23;"You can catch me and my crew eating hot Cheetos and Takis."
42:23;42:24;"Pop."
42:24;42:25;"Snack, snack, snack."
42:25;42:26;"Oh, I remember this."
42:26;42:27;"Crunch."
42:27;42:29;"Snack, snack, snack."
42:29;42:31;"Hot Cheetos and Takis."
42:33;42:36;"You can catch me and my crew eating hot Cheetos and Takis."
42:36;42:38;"It's about a quarter to a four."
42:38;42:39;"Yep."
42:39;42:40;"Rolling to the store."
42:40;42:41;"Okay."
42:41;42:42;"What you about to get?"
42:42;42:43;"Ha, you already know."
42:43;42:45;"Girl, I ain't three or four dollars in the cup."
42:45;42:50;"But they cut me some hot Cheetos and a lemonade Prince."
42:50;42:51;"Okay."
42:51;42:52;"I'm riding, riding on my bike to go."
42:52;42:54;"Riding, riding on my bike to go."
42:54;42:57;"Pull up to the studio 'cause we know just a kid be melting their microphone."
42:57;43:00;"Munching on my Takis like I just don't care."
43:00;43:04;"Then I walked up to yo girl and she asked me to share."
43:04;43:05;"Pop."
43:05;43:08;"Yo, I'm hungry where them Cheetos at?"
43:08;43:11;"They stay biting like where them mosquitoes at?"
43:11;43:13;"I'm on point like an elbow."
43:13;43:15;"Hands wrap like Elmo."
43:15;43:16;"My mama said, ""Have you had enough?"""
43:16;43:18;"I looked and I said, ""No, ma'am."
43:18;43:19;"I go ham."""
43:19;43:21;"In the grocery store or a Spanner and Pocky."
43:21;43:22;"You know it."
43:22;43:25;"Riding with my allowance 'cause nobody can stop me."
43:25;43:27;"All the kids want to be him."
43:27;43:28;"Go crazy when they see him."
43:28;43:32;"My mom hit the ATM 'cause she know I need them."
43:32;43:33;"Hot Cheetos and Takis."
43:33;43:35;"Hot Cheetos and Takis."
43:35;43:36;"What year is this?"
43:36;43:38;"It's like mid-2000s, right?"
43:38;43:42;"The YouTube video was uploaded on 2012."
43:42;43:43;"Okay."
43:43;43:45;"Released in 2012, dude."
43:45;43:46;"Oh, wow."

43:54;43:56;"That's a great song."
43:56;44:02;"At the end of the Richard Montanez movie when the shady executive's in jail."
44:02;44:03;"Yeah."
44:03;44:05;"Like Richard Montanez is on a yacht."
44:05;44:07;"The shady executive's in jail."
44:07;44:09;"Then that song drops."
44:09;44:10;"[laughs]"
44:10;44:13;"Just like that guy's in jail like, ""No!"""
44:13;44:14;"[imitates gunshot]"
44:14;44:16;"Great song."
44:16;44:19;"Yeah, snack food inspired pop song."
44:19;44:20;"These kids have great voices."

45:07;45:08;"You stay shout it out, my [bleep]"
45:08;45:11;"That was back when we was copping dumps and trying to roll a pound."
45:11;45:14;"Now I'm [bleep] living good, I done made it out the hood."
45:14;45:17;"Think I'm going back, I wish the mother mother would."
45:18;45:21;"They say I got the city on fire."
45:21;45:23;"I ain't booming, that's the [bleep]"
45:23;45:25;"I'm loud, whoa."
45:25;45:28;"Really though, like really though."
45:31;45:34;"They say I got the city on fire."
45:34;45:36;"I ain't booming, that's the [bleep]"
45:36;45:38;"I'm loud, whoa."
45:38;45:41;"Really though, like really though."
45:41;45:43;"Really though, like really though."
45:43;45:46;"I mean, one thing I'll say about Hot Cheetos and Takis is like"
45:46;45:49;"because of the spiciness, you're not going to overdo it on them."
45:49;45:50;"I don't know, man."
45:50;45:51;"Depends on the person."
45:51;45:52;"Yeah, I think people--"
45:52;45:53;"Yeah, depends on the person."
45:53;45:57;"You know, you could easily develop a tolerance."
45:57;46:00;"Oh yeah, and just pound like a giant bag of Hot Cheetos."
46:00;46:01;"I'm sure it happens, dude."
46:01;46:03;"I've never had Hot Cheetos, actually."
46:03;46:04;"Really?"
46:04;46:06;"Yeah, I'm not a Cheetos guy."
46:06;46:07;"I like Cheetos."
46:07;46:08;"Yeah?"
46:08;46:09;"They're crunchy."
46:09;46:11;"They're cheesy."
46:11;46:16;"I've always liked Chester Cheeto as a spokesman."
46:16;46:20;"Because I remember when I was a kid, you remember Joe Camel for Camel Cigarettes?"
46:20;46:21;"Yeah, yeah."
46:21;46:22;"Joe Camel was like so cool."
46:22;46:26;"He was definitely one of my heroes as a kid, but my parents are very anti-smoking."
46:26;46:31;"So I was very attracted to the mystique of Joe Camel."
46:31;46:35;"I would see pictures of him wearing sunglasses and playing pool."
46:35;46:38;"And I would always want a Joe Camel t-shirt and things like that."
46:38;46:39;"Oh yeah."
46:39;46:43;"And my parents were very square when it came to cigarettes."
46:43;46:49;"Didn't like the idea of me collecting Camel Cigarette ephemera."
46:49;46:52;"Becoming an influencer, maybe, to other people?"
46:52;46:54;"You're rolling around with a Joe Camel tee?"
46:54;46:59;"Yeah, I guess that would have been embarrassing for them if I rolled up to grade school"
46:59;47:02;"talking like Joe Camel everything."
47:02;47:04;"All Joe Camel everything?"
47:04;47:08;"As a kid in the early to mid-90s, it wasn't like today."
47:08;47:16;"You really only had a few choices of cartoon animal spokespeople who were cool and wore sunglasses."
47:16;47:20;"And besides Joe Camel, it was Chester Cheeto or nothing."
47:20;47:21;"Spuds McKenzie."
47:21;47:23;"Not a cartoon, but--"
47:23;47:26;"Oh yeah, well also that was alcohol, so again, that wasn't going to fly."
47:26;47:29;"So Chester Cheeto, he was kind of like--I don't know."
47:29;47:31;"Like you had a cool older friend."
47:31;47:37;"What about on the next vampire press cycle, you start rocking Joe Camel tees?"
47:37;47:40;"Not mention it."
47:40;47:42;"You start showing up to interviews or whatever."
47:42;47:49;"That's a classic thing that grown peoples start collecting the toy that they weren't allowed to have as a kid."
47:49;47:51;"Oh yeah."
47:51;47:55;"Like you hear about some dude who has a crazy collection of Matchbox cars, and you're like, ""So what's that all about?"""
47:55;48:01;"You know man, I grew up really poor and I had one Matchbox car, and it was my prized possession."
48:01;48:03;"A kid down the street stole it."
48:03;48:07;"I think actually that's--with my sour candy stuff, that's a big part of it."
48:07;48:13;"Because actually thinking through my 5, 10, 15, 20, I could only come up with beverages."
48:13;48:19;"And then right when I was 15, I was able to go to the store on my own, have my own money."
48:19;48:21;"That's really when the mayhem began."
48:21;48:23;"Buy whatever you want."
48:23;48:27;"Yeah, and I think that's why to this day I'm still doing it."
48:27;48:29;"[laughter]"
48:29;48:35;"If you have kids, are you going to let them at 4 or 5 just go buck wild on candy and experience the nausea?"
48:35;48:42;"You know, I gotta get in there, be a parent for a couple years, sort of feel out my kids and sort of know how they'll react to things."
48:42;48:46;"But I think complete and utter prohibition has failed me."
48:46;48:48;"I don't want to do that to my children."
48:48;48:49;"I'm with you, man."
48:49;48:54;"I think you gotta let kids try the gross food, otherwise it will always be the forbidden fruit."
48:54;48:58;"And that's kind of how I feel, because my family only had healthy snacks."
48:58;48:59;"Classic."
48:59;49:00;"Backfired."
49:00;49:03;"Well, thanks for joining us, Chris, and thanks for walking us through your entire life."
49:03;49:06;"You know, it's been a real honor and a privilege. Thank you."
49:06;49:09;"All right, next time you come through, we're getting some Carolina Reaper chips."
49:09;49:10;"Hell yeah."
51:30;51:34;"So before we move on, Jake, have we fully exhausted hot Cheetos as a topic?"
51:34;51:35;"Not quite."
51:35;51:36;"Oh yeah?"
51:36;51:38;"Alex's email continues."
51:38;51:45;"The outcry from health professionals has been used to ban Flamin' Hots from certain school districts in California, Illinois, and New Mexico."
51:45;51:47;"Harsh."
51:47;51:48;"Yeah."
51:48;51:53;"So there's people, like, basically it's like kids love it, they're shoveling it in their face, they can't stop shoveling it in their face."
51:53;51:55;"But why pick on hot Cheetos?"
51:55;51:57;"Because they're hot?"
51:57;51:58;"Yeah."
51:58;51:59;"That's lame."
51:59;52:03;"Oh, but like some bland Lay's are okay? We can't eat hot Cheetos?"
52:03;52:12;"15 years ago NPR did a piece on all things considered about red hot Cheetos being banned from schools."
52:12;52:15;"We can't just take the NPR segment and play it."
52:15;52:16;"Uh huh."
52:16;52:18;"I wish we could."
52:18;52:26;"But our producer Colin really took the initiative here and made a sound collage from that NPR segment."
52:26;52:30;"It's an aesthetic journey, but it's also informational."
52:30;52:37;"Okay, so this is a remixed NPR story about how some school districts were banning hot Cheetos."
52:37;52:41;"Exactly, in the form of a sound collage by our producer Colin."
52:41;52:43;"Perfect. Let 'er rip."
52:43;52:48;"Now a story about a snack food that is winning no culinary awards."
52:48;52:53;"If you've got school-age children, you may be aware of a red menace that is sweeping the nation."
52:53;52:55;"Flaming hot Cheetos."
53:01;53:03;"I just love hot Cheetos."
53:03;53:06;"I love 'em so much."
53:06;53:10;"When I eat hot Cheetos I get crazy."
53:10;53:12;"Snack food."
53:12;53:15;"Red hot Cheetos."
53:15;53:17;"When I eat hot Cheetos I get crazy."
53:17;53:19;"Flaming hot Cheetos."
53:19;53:21;"Snack food."
53:21;53:27;"I like them so much. They're my favorite."
53:27;53:30;"I just love hot Cheetos."
53:30;53:36;"They love the spiciness, the crunch, the illicit nature of the snacks."
53:36;53:40;"One snack the kids spend their recesses talking about."
53:44;53:56;"When you eat a spicy food and experience a burn, you have a release of these morphine or opium-like chemicals in the brain."
53:56;54:00;"Something called our trigeminal nerve is actually irritating."
54:00;54:05;"Scientists theorize the body releases endorphins to help us cope with the discomfort."
54:05;54:11;"You get a little high from the release of these chemicals."
54:11;54:13;"Did you hear that, mothers of America?"
54:13;54:16;"You get a little high, high, high."
54:19;54:23;"Snack food. Flaming hot Cheetos."
54:23;54:26;"They love the spiciness."
54:26;54:28;"When I eat hot Cheetos I get crazy."
54:28;54:30;"They love the spiciness."
54:30;54:32;"I like 'em so much."
54:32;54:35;"Did you hear that, mothers of America?"
54:35;54:37;"They're my favorite."
54:37;54:39;"Flaming hot Cheetos."
54:39;54:42;"When I eat hot Cheetos I get crazy."
54:42;54:46;"One snack the kids spend their recesses talking about."
54:46;54:48;"I just love hot Cheetos."
54:48;54:50;"I love 'em so much."
54:50;54:53;"[laughter]"
54:53;54:55;"What would happen to me if I ate this whole bag?"
54:55;54:57;"You might have to run."
54:57;55:00;"Your body might, body might, body might be burning."
55:00;55:03;"[laughter]"
55:03;55:05;"You might have to run."
55:05;55:07;"One, two, three."
55:07;55:11;"Hot Cheetos in color."
55:11;55:14;"Okay, that was a sound collage journey"
55:14;55:17;"through the hot Cheetos debate."
55:17;55:20;"If you're eating hot Cheetos, you know, Google it."
55:20;55:22;"It's your right to eat hot Cheetos."
55:22;55:24;"They're delicious, but you know, just know what you're getting into."
55:24;55:27;"So we've been talking a lot about snack foods today."
55:27;55:29;"I hope it's been educational for everybody,"
55:29;55:31;"but let's keep it real."
55:31;55:37;"You and I are not quite experts on the corporate food industry."
55:37;55:38;"We're very close."
55:38;55:39;"Speak for yourself."
55:39;55:41;"All right, maybe you are,"
55:41;55:45;"but neither of us have won a Pulitzer Prize,"
55:45;55:48;"and neither had Chris Baio, who was here before."
55:48;55:52;"So we're going to talk to this dude, Michael Moss,"
55:52;55:54;"who's a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist"
55:54;55:56;"and author of the number one New York Times best-selling"
55:56;55:59;"""Salt, Sugar, Fat--How the Food Giants Hooked Us."""
55:59;56:02;"So let's give him a call to see what a real deal"
56:02;56:05;"food industry muckraker has to say"
56:05;56:07;"about the corporate food industrial complex."
56:07;56:11;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
56:11;56:12;"[phone ringing]"
56:12;56:14;"Hey, Michael, thanks for joining us."
56:14;56:15;"Hey, nice to talk to you."
56:15;56:17;"So you want to tell us a little bit about yourself"
56:17;56:19;"and your book ""Salt, Sugar, Fat""?"
56:19;56:22;"I'm a journalist, have been for a number of years."
56:22;56:24;"I mostly do investigative stuff,"
56:24;56:27;"which mostly means poking around into places"
56:27;56:29;"that people don't want me poking around."
56:29;56:32;"And a few years ago, I started poking into"
56:32;56:36;"this trillion-dollar industry called processed food,"
56:36;56:40;"mostly from the standpoint of wanting to know"
56:40;56:46;"how they got us so hooked on their products."
56:46;56:49;"I was reading some of your interviews today."
56:49;56:52;"There were a couple details that really stuck out to me."
56:52;56:55;"One was the consumption of cheese per capita"
56:55;56:58;"has tripled in the last 30 or 40 years."
56:58;57:03;"Yeah, I think we were at about 11 pounds back in the '70s."
57:03;57:08;"We hit 33 pounds per person per year on average"
57:08;57:09;"a couple years ago."
57:09;57:12;"And this isn't just cheese you have, you know,"
57:12;57:15;"on a cracker or hors d'oeuvre or as a cheese sandwich."
57:15;57:18;"The industry figured out, kind of in conjunction"
57:18;57:21;"with the Department of Agriculture and dairy farmers,"
57:21;57:25;"a way to sell more, a way to use more milk or cheese"
57:25;57:30;"by using it as an ingredient in lots of different processed food."
57:30;57:33;"And cheese started showing up, well, you know,"
57:33;57:35;"in sandwiches at sandwich shops."
57:35;57:38;"Used to be cheese wasn't all a common thing,"
57:38;57:39;"but now it's on everything."
57:39;57:41;"Wait, so you're telling me people used to not put cheese"
57:41;57:42;"on sandwiches?"
57:42;57:47;"No, they did, but not to the extent that they started to"
57:47;57:51;"when the dairy industry started pushing cheese in market"
57:51;57:53;"and went to sandwich shops and says,"
57:53;57:56;"""Look, you guys will not only sell more sandwiches,"
57:56;57:58;"but you'll be able to charge more for them"
57:58;57:59;"with this little bit of cheese."""
57:59;58:00;"And it'll wow people."
58:00;58:02;"It really was a concerted effort."
58:02;58:03;"Wow."
58:03;58:06;"If we're eating 22 pounds more of cheese per year,"
58:06;58:10;"how many pounds of that is just that powdery Cheetos dust?"
58:10;58:14;"Like, are we eating four or five pounds of Cheetos dust?"
58:14;58:16;"If only they could measure how much of that dust"
58:16;58:20;"is left on your fingers after eating those Cheetos,"
58:20;58:22;"we probably would know the answer."
58:22;58:24;"It's a very good percentage."
58:24;58:29;"It's in the order of four or five, maybe 10%,"
58:29;58:31;"even higher depending on sort of the person,"
58:31;58:33;"it's sort of just processed cheese,"
58:33;58:35;"which is aged hardly at all."
58:35;58:39;"Milk in, cheese out is how those factories are described"
58:39;58:40;"in making it."
58:40;58:43;"So it's very bland, tasteless almost,"
58:43;58:46;"except for that mouthfeel of the fat."
58:46;58:48;"Now, something else that really stuck out to me is"
58:48;58:51;"there was an anecdote you relayed where you went to"
58:51;58:53;"a Frito-Lay executive's home,"
58:53;58:56;"and he had no processed food in his own house,"
58:56;58:59;"and he served you actually plain oatmeal and asparagus,"
58:59;59:01;"which sounds like a terrible meal, by the way."
59:01;59:04;"Yeah, and this was a scientist who back in the '80s"
59:04;59:08;"was fighting with Frito-Lay to get them to cut back"
59:08;59:11;"on their salt usage in snacks."
59:11;59:15;"He was very concerned about the ties that eating too much salt"
59:15;59:17;"has with bad heart trouble."
59:17;59:19;"And that was one of the most surprising things about him,"
59:19;59:23;"is that many of the scientists, the engineers,"
59:23;59:25;"the food inventors, the marketers,"
59:25;59:27;"the chief executives of these companies"
59:27;59:30;"don't eat their own stuff."
59:30;59:32;"Partly because it's kind of a class issue."
59:32;59:33;"They don't have to."
59:33;59:35;"They have a spouse who's not working,"
59:35;59:37;"and they can make their own lunches for the kids"
59:37;59:41;"and cook great dinners from scratch at home, right?"
59:41;59:44;"They're not both out working like three jobs to make ends meet."
59:44;59:45;"Right."
59:45;59:47;"But the other thing is they kind of know"
59:47;59:51;"how powerful their products are and how difficult it is"
59:51;59:53;"for many people, including them,"
59:53;59:57;"to just eat a handful of those chips and not the entire bag."
59:57;59:59;"So they would avoid it altogether."
59:59;01:00:01;"You made an interesting point there, Michael, the class issue."
01:00:01;01:00:04;"And I'm wondering, does anybody ever try to hit back at you"
01:00:04;01:00:07;"with a kind of half-baked class argument that's kind of like,"
01:00:07;01:00:12;"""Wow, man, you're hating on American cheese and Fritos."
01:00:12;01:00:14;"""Must be nice that you can afford to be a foodie."
01:00:14;01:00:16;"""You're really just hating on working people."""
01:00:16;01:00:17;"Yeah, but it doesn't work,"
01:00:17;01:00:20;"'cause I grew up on Velveeta cheese and Pop-Tarts."
01:00:20;01:00:22;"I mean, I am like..."
01:00:22;01:00:25;"Those icons are burnished in my psyche like most Americans."
01:00:25;01:00:29;"No, but look, it's a serious issue."
01:00:29;01:00:32;"In order to eat well in this country,"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"you have to have a certain amount of money."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"And you walk in the grocery store"
01:00:36;01:00:39;"meaning to do right by you and your family,"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"just eating vegetables that's going to cost you"
01:00:41;01:00:45;"more than eating junky stuff in the rest of the store."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"That doesn't make it right."
01:00:46;01:00:48;"It makes it a real problem"
01:00:48;01:00:52;"and a real sort of economic and class divide in this country."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"That said, I mean, it's..."
01:00:55;01:00:59;"A lot of the junkiest food isn't as inexpensive"
01:00:59;01:01:00;"as you might think it is."
01:01:00;01:01:03;"And it is, in fact, possible to eat well"
01:01:03;01:01:06;"with a lot of work for not a whole lot more money."
01:01:06;01:01:09;"How about your thoughts on kind of going forward"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"in these huge processed food companies"
01:01:11;01:01:12;"marketing to millennials?"
01:01:12;01:01:15;"Because they seem like a slightly more savvy generation,"
01:01:15;01:01:19;"maybe less prone to just like crushing Doritos."
01:01:19;01:01:22;"The millennials are just killing these food giants."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"They want, especially their snacks, right?"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"And just to back up a second,"
01:01:25;01:01:28;"what really drove the industry were baby boomers"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"because as baby boomers grew older,"
01:01:30;01:01:34;"they didn't stop snacking like everybody thought we would."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"We kept on snacking,"
01:01:35;01:01:38;"and that turned out to be a tremendous boon"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"to the snack companies, especially millennials."
01:01:40;01:01:43;"Millennials, they love their snacks to be cheap,"
01:01:43;01:01:46;"to be easy, to be yummy,"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"but they're also sort of insisting"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"that that food not like kill them."
01:01:50;01:01:53;"They're wanting that food to be good for them too."
01:01:53;01:01:56;"And that is causing this biggest change in the industry."
01:01:56;01:01:59;"You have all of the largest companies scrambling"
01:01:59;01:02:03;"to sort of reformulate, reinvent themselves,"
01:02:03;01:02:06;"to have that added sort of fourth element."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"Their food sort of be like, you know,"
01:02:08;01:02:09;"less bad for you at least,"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"and maybe even good for you."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"And it's the hardest thing for them"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"because they're all trying to cut back"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"on salt, sugar, fat now, maybe calories."
01:02:17;01:02:21;"But when you talk to them about adding good stuff"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"to their products, and I did this recently with Nestle,"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"one of the biggest companies at all,"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"they own the Hot Pocket brand."
01:02:27;01:02:29;"And I was surprised they even had me come visit them"
01:02:29;01:02:31;"because in the book I called the Hot Pocket"
01:02:31;01:02:34;"a poster boy for the obesity epidemic."
01:02:34;01:02:36;"Nestle, to its credit, is going great guns"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"to reduce the salt, sugar, fat,"
01:02:38;01:02:41;"the calories in it as well."
01:02:41;01:02:44;"But if you ask them what they're able to do"
01:02:44;01:02:48;"to stuff those Hot Pockets with some of that stuff,"
01:02:48;01:02:50;"every nutritionist says we should be eating more of,"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"we should be doubling down on."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"I'm talking about broccoli and Brussels sprouts"
01:02:54;01:02:57;"and even kale, God help us."
01:02:57;01:02:59;"You know, you kind of get this blank stare."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"- I mean, is that conceivable that Hot Pockets"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"could put out like a kale-stuffed Hot Pocket?"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"- Yeah, I think it is,"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"but I don't think it's gonna come for the food giants"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"'cause one of the other things I sort of learned"
01:03:09;01:03:13;"as a business scientist is how risk-averse they are."
01:03:13;01:03:14;"- Right."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"- There's this whole profusion of startups out there"
01:03:16;01:03:19;"who can take risk and know how to manage risk."
01:03:19;01:03:22;"And yeah, I think they're sort of starting to come up"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"with Hot Pocket-type things"
01:03:24;01:03:27;"that can actually sort of be healthy for you,"
01:03:27;01:03:29;"reinventing processed food"
01:03:29;01:03:32;"to have all those kind of essential elements,"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"the cheapness, the convenience, the yumminess,"
01:03:34;01:03:38;"but also the good-for-you-ness as well."
01:03:38;01:03:42;"And that's a terrific change to our eating habits,"
01:03:42;01:03:43;"if it happens."
01:03:43;01:03:45;"- Hey, Michael, thanks a lot for joining us."
01:03:45;01:03:46;"One last question."
01:03:46;01:03:50;"What's the absolutely worst snack food for people?"
01:03:50;01:03:51;"- Yeah."
01:03:51;01:03:54;"You know, I think it kind of depends on the person"
01:03:54;01:03:59;"and how much that snack might drive you crazy."
01:03:59;01:04:02;"So for one person, it might be an Oreo,"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"simply 'cause they're gonna eat the whole bag."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"And again, it's not that the Oreos are bad."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"It's that when you're in that mode"
01:04:08;01:04:12;"where you're busy or crazed or craving,"
01:04:12;01:04:16;"you're susceptible to eating that whole bag."
01:04:16;01:04:18;"And if you do that day in and day out,"
01:04:18;01:04:19;"you have a real problem."
01:04:19;01:04:22;"So it kind of depends on the person."
01:04:22;01:04:24;"Myself, potato chips."
01:04:24;01:04:26;"I shouldn't say it's my downfall,"
01:04:26;01:04:30;"because I'm able to kind of resist the temptation"
01:04:30;01:04:32;"to eat the whole bag most of the time."
01:04:32;01:04:36;"But that to me is the perfect devil snack"
01:04:36;01:04:37;"that gets me every time."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"- Well, thanks a lot for calling in."
01:04:39;01:04:40;"- Yeah, thank you, Michael."
01:04:40;01:04:41;"- You're welcome."
01:04:41;01:04:42;"Yeah, good luck with the show."
01:04:42;01:04:43;"- Yeah, keep fighting the good fight."
01:04:43;01:04:44;"- Yeah, you too."
01:04:44;01:04:45;"- Have a good one."

01:09:17;01:09:20;"- How's that working out? - Full disclosure,"
01:09:20;01:09:24;"I ate one little bag of Wild Berry Skittles,"
01:09:24;01:09:28;"and now I'm eating original Skittles, and I gotta be honest,"
01:09:28;01:09:31;"blindfolded, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference."
01:09:31;01:09:33;"- I believe that. - Very similar."
01:09:33;01:09:35;"- I hate Skittles. - You hate Skittles?"
01:09:35;01:09:39;"I just have the most, like, visceral, disgusting memory of Skittles."
01:09:39;01:09:41;"- What? - I remember going to my friend's"
01:09:41;01:09:44;"- when I was like 10. - Yeah?"
01:09:44;01:09:47;"- He had a Nintendo system in his basement. - Sick."
01:09:47;01:09:50;"I wanted to, like, play outside, but we were playing--"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"- Oh, man. - We were playing Commando"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"at, like, 11 AM on his Nintendo system,"
01:09:55;01:09:59;"and he's got this bowl of Skittles right between us."

01:10:41;01:10:43;"- All right, you know what, man? - All right, moving on."
01:10:43;01:10:45;"Moving on. Let's agree to disagree."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"A lot of people sometimes forget"
01:10:47;01:10:50;"that Seinfeld 2000 works on ""Time Crisis."""

01:11:07;01:11:09;"but I think he's got it under control."
01:11:09;01:11:11;"So welcome back, Seinfeld 2000. What's up, man?"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"Hey, what's up?"
01:11:13;01:11:15;"Oh, no, wait, wait."
01:11:15;01:11:18;"Are you already bringing some attitude on the mic?"
01:11:18;01:11:21;"No, I'll keep it cool. I'll keep it cool this time around."
01:11:21;01:11:24;"I think we've come to an agreement. I think we've found our rhythm."
01:11:24;01:11:26;"I feel like we haven't talked about Seinfeld in a while."
01:11:26;01:11:29;"- Yeah, what's up with that? - Well, lately,"
01:11:29;01:11:32;"my family and I have been going back and watching ""Friends."""
01:11:32;01:11:35;"Yeah, no, that's cool for you to have me on the show"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"and then provoke me like that right off the top."
01:11:37;01:11:39;"- I don't think there's anything-- - That's cool."
01:11:39;01:11:42;"Sir, there is nothing provocative about that."
01:11:42;01:11:45;"And frankly, it's worrisome that you would be provoked"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"by something as beautiful as ""Friends."""
01:11:47;01:11:49;"( music playing )"
01:11:49;01:11:53;"I didn't mean for that to become its own kind of subtopic."
01:11:53;01:11:56;"I know we've been focused on, you know, the food industry,"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"- the snack industry, and-- - Yeah."
01:11:58;01:12:01;"So how are you gonna link this to Seinfeld? I'm curious."
01:12:01;01:12:04;"Well, you know, Seinfeld, which was a popular TV show"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"in the 1990s and late '80s,"
01:12:06;01:12:09;"actually had a very interesting through-line."
01:12:09;01:12:13;"A lot of food, you know, food in general."
01:12:13;01:12:15;"We're talking about, you know, rye,"
01:12:15;01:12:17;"um, babka, things like that."
01:12:17;01:12:19;"Soup is soup, a meal. Pies."
01:12:19;01:12:23;"But of course, there were specific snack brands as well."
01:12:23;01:12:27;"I guess I thought it would be interesting to discuss a few of them."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"Break it down for us, man."
01:12:28;01:12:31;"What are some of the classic Seinfeld episodes"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"that name-check specific food brands?"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"You know, we could talk about snacks in general."
01:12:35;01:12:36;"We could talk about pretzels."
01:12:36;01:12:39;"We could talk about black and white cookie, for example."
01:12:39;01:12:42;"But if we want to talk about brands, you know,"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"we could talk about, uh, the Junior Mints,"
01:12:44;01:12:47;"which actually-- I don't know if people remember this,"
01:12:47;01:12:50;"but Ezra was involved in a video game."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"- Oh, the Junior Mints video game. - Junior Mints video game."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"Do you guys like Junior Mints?"
01:12:54;01:12:57;"- You have great candy. - I don't know about Junior Mints."
01:12:57;01:12:58;"- What? - What's the Seinfeld tie-in?"
01:12:58;01:13:01;"Kramer and Jerry get to see a patient"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"whose Elaine's boyfriend being operated on."
01:13:03;01:13:05;"- Oh, yeah, he's a surgeon. - Right."
01:13:05;01:13:08;"No, he's being operated on. He's having an operation."
01:13:08;01:13:11;"They're at the observation deck, and they drop--"
01:13:11;01:13:12;"They're actually-- they're eating--"
01:13:12;01:13:16;"I guess the joke of the scene is that Kramer has brought"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"some Junior Mints, and they're watching--"
01:13:18;01:13:19;"like you would a movie."
01:13:19;01:13:22;"And they get into an argument, and Jerry doesn't want one,"
01:13:22;01:13:26;"and one mint goes flying into the patient's open surgical cavity,"
01:13:26;01:13:29;"which is all the present premise of the game."
01:13:29;01:13:30;"How about the Twix bar?"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"There's a Seinfeld episode about Twix?"
01:13:32;01:13:33;"Ezra."
01:13:33;01:13:35;"- I don't remember. - You've been watching too much Friends, man."
01:13:35;01:13:37;"I mean, I don't-- I don't even know what that's on."
01:13:37;01:13:39;"I told you, man. I'm into Friends, though."
01:13:39;01:13:40;"Ay-yi-yi."
01:13:40;01:13:43;"So, you know, Seinfeld would have multiple episodes"
01:13:43;01:13:45;"set in just one location, and that's what--"
01:13:45;01:13:49;"you know, one of the aspects that made it such a groundbreaking show."
01:13:49;01:13:52;"One such episode of Seinfeld was at a car dealership."
01:13:52;01:13:55;"David Putty, Elaine's boyfriend, was there,"
01:13:55;01:13:58;"and George was very hungry, and he wants to get a Twix bar,"
01:13:58;01:14:01;"and it's that old classic vending machine thing"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"where the Twix gets stuck in the thing."
01:14:03;01:14:06;"He goes off to get some change to get two Twix bars."
01:14:06;01:14:12;"When he comes back, a mechanic has absconded with his Twix."
01:14:12;01:14:14;"And he's-- you know, it's sort of--"
01:14:14;01:14:17;"you know, it's one of the plots of the episode."
01:14:17;01:14:19;"All right, lace us with one more."
01:14:19;01:14:20;"Let's do the Pez dispenser."
01:14:20;01:14:22;"Pez, weird candy."
01:14:22;01:14:24;"It is weird. That was a candy that was--"
01:14:24;01:14:25;"Toy and a candy."
01:14:25;01:14:29;"It was kind of more about the toy than the candy, I feel."
01:14:29;01:14:32;"I like them, but they remind me of toothpaste a little bit."
01:14:32;01:14:35;"When was the last time you had Pez?"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"Um..."
01:14:37;01:14:39;"June of '97."
01:14:39;01:14:41;"Yeah, probably the '90s."
01:14:41;01:14:43;"So over-- what is that?"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"It's like over 20 years ago."
01:14:45;01:14:46;"Yeah, probably was 20 years ago."
01:14:46;01:14:47;"I'd say maybe a half."
01:14:47;01:14:51;"Wow, I don't even remember what Pez candy tastes like, to be honest."
01:14:51;01:14:53;"I feel like it's soapy a little bit."
01:14:53;01:14:54;"Yeah, exactly, soapy."
01:14:54;01:14:56;"It's a little bit soapy."
01:14:56;01:15:00;"So of course the episode is where Elaine and Jerry"
01:15:00;01:15:03;"are at this recital of George's girlfriend."
01:15:03;01:15:05;"She's playing the piano, and it's a very quiet moment,"
01:15:05;01:15:09;"and somebody puts-- Jerry puts the Pez dispenser on Elaine's knee,"
01:15:09;01:15:12;"and she starts laughing."
01:15:12;01:15:15;"[laughs]"
01:15:15;01:15:17;"And it's a classic episode."
01:15:17;01:15:19;"You know what, man? I'm regretting this segment."
01:15:19;01:15:21;"I really feel like we should have asked you"
01:15:21;01:15:23;"for Friends episodes with food."
01:15:23;01:15:25;"[♪♪♪]"
01:15:25;01:15:28;"Because I feel like Seinfeld, so snarky,"
01:15:28;01:15:32;"but Friends, they kind of appreciated food brands more."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"Just off the top of your head, do you know any Friends episodes"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"that had, like, snack foods?"
01:15:36;01:15:37;"Don't answer that."
01:15:37;01:15:38;"You know, this is--"
01:15:38;01:15:39;"Don't answer that."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"This is a little humiliating, and I do feel a little bit like"
01:15:41;01:15:42;"I've been punked."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"What do you mean? You're a TV guy."
01:15:44;01:15:46;"I feel like I've been punked on your show."
01:15:46;01:15:47;"You love '90s TV."
01:15:47;01:15:49;"Seinfeld and Friends is basically the same show."
01:15:49;01:15:51;"They're both on NBC."
01:15:51;01:15:53;"[♪♪♪]"
01:15:53;01:15:55;"I think it's going to be a little while before, you know,"
01:15:55;01:15:59;"I come out of the shadows and reveal my--"
01:15:59;01:16:00;"You know, it takes--"
01:16:00;01:16:01;"Well, you know what, man?"
01:16:01;01:16:02;"You know what, man?"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"You signed a 30-year contract to work at Time Crisis,"
01:16:04;01:16:05;"so guess what?"
01:16:05;01:16:08;"For the next episode, your assignment--"
01:16:08;01:16:11;"and this is coming from the boss, the boss of the crisis--"
01:16:11;01:16:12;"On high."
01:16:12;01:16:15;"Your assignment is to pick"
01:16:15;01:16:19;"the three greatest Friends episodes of all time,"
01:16:19;01:16:24;"and you need to write two paragraphs about each episode"
01:16:24;01:16:26;"explaining why you love it,"
01:16:26;01:16:30;"explaining what about the acting, the writing, and the scenario"
01:16:30;01:16:32;"made it one of the best Friends episodes."
01:16:32;01:16:33;"Okay?"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"Yeah, okay. Yeah, we'll see."
01:16:35;01:16:36;"We'll see."
01:16:36;01:16:37;"Yeah, we will see."
01:16:37;01:16:38;"See you in two weeks."
01:16:38;01:16:39;"Yeah. All right."
01:16:39;01:16:41;"I hope you got your library card."
