00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis back once again."
00:03;00:06;"After many weeks with not a lot of guests,"
00:06;00:09;"we come hard with two."
00:09;00:14;"Legendary uncle of Jake and musician Uncle Ted."
00:14;00:19;"We'll also be joined by legendary writer, talk show"
00:19;00:21;"host, and podcaster Spike Ferencton."
00:21;00:27;"All this plus art talk and the great music of today in 1995."
00:27;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:31;00:37;"[MUSIC - EZRA KOENIG, ""TIME CRISIS""]"
00:37;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:43;00:50;"They were a friend, warming me, all my rightful chances."
00:50;00:57;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:57;01:01;"And so I dealt you the blow."
01:01;01:04;"One of us had to go."
01:04;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:09;01:11;"One of us is crying."
01:11;01:14;"One of us is lying."
01:14;01:19;"Leave the lonely man."
01:19;01:22;"All right, Time Crisis back once again."
01:22;01:23;"What's up, Jake?"
01:23;01:24;"Not much, man."
01:24;01:25;"How are you?"
01:25;01:27;"You know, business as usual."
01:27;01:27;"Yeah."
01:27;01:31;"I guess since the last episode, we became candy influencers."
01:31;01:33;"So we should probably talk about that."
01:33;01:34;"That is true."
01:34;01:39;"And also that's going to lead into our Hershey's Yingling"
01:39;01:40;"taste test."
01:40;01:41;"Yeah."
01:41;01:43;"I bet there probably is like a podcast, maybe not"
01:43;01:45;"an internet radio show, but I can"
01:45;01:47;"imagine there's a podcast somewhere that's"
01:47;01:48;"about beer and candy."
01:48;01:53;"And then when the Yingling Hershey's comes out,"
01:53;01:54;"that's a big deal."
01:54;01:56;"And they get to finally talk about both."
01:56;01:59;"But I can totally see that person who's a candy"
01:59;02:01;"enthusiast and a beer enthusiast."
02:01;02:04;"Well, I'm sorry, but there is one podcast called"
02:04;02:07;"It's the Beer Talking."
02:07;02:10;"They do a Halloween candy and beer pairing episode."
02:10;02:11;"There you go."
02:11;02:14;"It's not a whole pod dedicated to it,"
02:14;02:18;"but it's definitely a hard 41 minutes about Halloween candy"
02:18;02:19;"and beer pairing."
02:19;02:21;"Well, as a beer and candy enthusiast,"
02:21;02:24;"I only check in with that podcast for the Halloween app,"
02:24;02:25;"but it is good."
02:25;02:26;"I do recommend it."
02:26;02:30;"But I only listen once a year for the candy and beer app."
02:30;02:33;"I wonder if you could do a study and be"
02:33;02:36;"like kids who are really into candy become adults who are"
02:36;02:41;"really into beer, if there's a connection there."
02:41;02:44;"I feel like now it'd be like kids who are really into candy"
02:44;02:46;"become adults who are really into candy."
02:46;02:47;"Yeah, you're right."
02:47;02:49;"There's no you don't have to give it up."
02:49;02:53;"And I feel like maybe back a generation or two prior,"
02:53;02:54;"you would have had to give it up."
02:54;02:55;"Right."
02:55;02:57;"And you shift to alcohol or something."
02:57;02:59;"Yeah, like the Mad Men era."
02:59;02:59;"Yeah."
02:59;03:06;"Don Draper's not wailing on peanut M&Ms."
03:06;03:09;"There's like a whole episode of that."
03:09;03:12;"Don's just stress eating peanut M&Ms."
03:12;03:15;"He has like this huge bowl of Skittles."
03:15;03:19;"He has a beautiful mid-century modern coffee table"
03:19;03:20;"in his office."
03:20;03:22;"And he's wearing this like tailored suit."
03:22;03:25;"He sits down for the meeting with the big account."
03:25;03:28;"And he pours two glasses of scotch."
03:28;03:31;"And then there's like just a big bowl of Skittles."
03:31;03:33;"Gentlemen, can I offer you a now and later?"
03:33;03:35;"Can I offer you some Sour Punch straws?"
03:35;03:38;"Or it's like he's lying on the mid-century couch"
03:38;03:39;"with his hat on his head."
03:39;03:41;"Like 3 PM, the secretary comes."
03:41;03:42;"It's like Mr. Draper."
03:42;03:44;"And he's just like, leave me alone."
03:44;03:47;"I had way too many Butterfingers."
03:47;03:49;"Me and Roger had a three Butterfinger lunch."
03:49;03:49;"Oh."
03:49;03:57;"Well, so Jake, walk me through your--"
03:57;03:59;"I think we had slightly different experiences"
03:59;04:02;"as we became candy influencers last week."
04:02;04:06;"Because I saw a big box delivered to my home."
04:06;04:07;"And I opened it."
04:07;04:09;"And there's this giant Kit Kat thing."
04:09;04:10;"And I'm like, wait."
04:10;04:13;"First of all, immediately, I go to Wikipedia."
04:13;04:15;"And I'm like, who owns Kit Kat?"
04:15;04:19;"And it turns out Hershey's owns Kit Kat only in the US."
04:19;04:22;"The rest of the world, Kit Kat is a Nestle product."
04:22;04:23;"So I was like, OK."
04:23;04:25;"Maybe it's our friends at Hershey's."
04:25;04:27;"But then I hit up the TC people."
04:27;04:28;"I hit up my manager."
04:28;04:30;"Nobody had actually communicated with them."
04:30;04:36;"So I guess they just used the CIA to just get to me direct."
04:36;04:37;"Wait, Jake, you're already drinking the beer?"
04:37;04:38;"Yeah, sorry."
04:38;04:39;"I had to get going."
04:39;04:40;"What?"
04:40;04:43;"What are you-- this whole thing."
04:43;04:44;"Jake's just making a-- all right."
04:44;04:44;"Well, Jake already made--"
04:44;04:46;"I didn't want you to blow up my spot."
04:46;04:48;"But when we got to the beer tasting episode,"
04:48;04:49;"I would have--"
04:49;04:50;"or portion of the episode, I would"
04:50;04:52;"have faked opening the beer."
04:52;04:53;"And then I would have been like, oh, yeah."
04:53;04:54;"I'm taking my first sip."
04:54;04:55;"All right, well, you know what?"
04:55;04:56;"I got it out of the freezer."
04:56;04:57;"It's freezing cold."
04:57;04:58;"I want to take a sip right now."
04:58;04:59;"[BLEEP]"
04:59;04:59;"We'll do it live."
04:59;05:03;"Everybody just drink your beer at your pleasure."
05:03;05:06;"This yingling Hershey's chocolate porter is nasty."
05:06;05:07;"I'm going to agree with Daniel."
05:07;05:08;"It's very chocolatey."
05:08;05:09;"It's a bummer."
05:09;05:10;"OK, well, hold on."
05:10;05:11;"Anyway."
05:11;05:13;"Yeah, let's get back to the Kit Kat."
05:13;05:14;"So I got this big box."
05:14;05:16;"And I was like, I guess it came from Hershey's."
05:16;05:19;"But it wasn't totally arranged."
05:19;05:20;"I wasn't expecting it."
05:20;05:21;"And then I opened the box."
05:21;05:25;"And there's a bunch of Kit Kats, a bunch of Mocha Kit Kats."
05:25;05:29;"And then there's-- it's a very well-made, high-quality"
05:29;05:31;"cardboard box."
05:31;05:33;"I'm sure producing each box--"
05:33;05:35;"you're using the really high-grade cardboard"
05:35;05:36;"to make it."
05:36;05:40;"I'm sure producing each one of those is maybe $14 a unit."
05:40;05:42;"Pretty good guess."
05:42;05:44;"And there's a pair of socks, a mug,"
05:44;05:47;"and then a bunch of mint Kit Kats."
05:47;05:48;"But I was still a little bit baffled"
05:48;05:49;"because there was no context."
05:49;05:52;"But then I hear that you got one too, Jake,"
05:52;05:54;"but yours came with a card."
05:54;05:55;"Somehow my card--"
05:55;05:56;"OK, yeah."
05:56;05:57;"Walk through your experience."
05:57;06:00;"I mean, yeah, I saw the big box."
06:00;06:03;"And I thought-- I was like, oh, I ordered some shoes last week."
06:03;06:04;"I bet they're here."
06:04;06:06;"Because it's like-- it looked like a shoe box,"
06:06;06:07;"but even bigger."
06:07;06:08;"And I'm sort of like--"
06:08;06:12;"And then I opened it up, and it was like this lush, gorgeous,"
06:12;06:15;"high-production-value box with just that beautiful,"
06:15;06:18;"kind of rich red, just a Jake category."
06:18;06:19;"And I was like, what is this?"
06:19;06:21;"And then, yeah, opened it up."
06:21;06:23;"Same experience with the shelving and the socks."
06:23;06:24;"But then there was two postcards."
06:24;06:28;"And one said, welcome to the Kit Kat Flavor Club."
06:28;06:33;"You are one of the first 200 members of the Kit Kat Flavor"
06:33;06:34;"Club."
06:34;06:36;"And then there was another card."
06:36;06:37;"So I felt great about that."
06:37;06:38;"I love being--"
06:38;06:40;"So there's only 200 people."
06:40;06:42;"If I had seen that, I would have felt--"
06:42;06:45;"I would have understood the importance of the moment more."
06:45;06:47;"So you're telling me there's only 200 people in the Kit Kat"
06:47;06:48;"Flavor Club?"
06:48;06:50;"Yeah, so that feels great for us to be all included in that."
06:50;06:55;"I like to be involved in exclusive clubs."
06:55;06:58;"And then there was another postcard, which I love,"
06:58;07:01;"that said, it's the Hershey Company Social Media"
07:01;07:03;"Guidelines."
07:03;07:06;"And there's eight rules that we have to follow since we're now"
07:06;07:07;"members of the club."
07:07;07:09;"Because if we're going to join the club,"
07:09;07:12;"we have to play ball."
07:12;07:13;"This isn't just a free lunch."
07:13;07:14;"Fair enough."
07:14;07:15;"What is a club without rules?"
07:15;07:17;"So please abide by the following guidelines"
07:17;07:21;"when posting about incentives, such as free samples, premiums,"
07:21;07:22;"or prizes on social media."
07:22;07:24;"Oh, [BLEEP] I posted about this."
07:24;07:25;"I really looked."
07:25;07:26;"I didn't see my card."
07:26;07:29;"You must disclose your connection to Hershey."
07:29;07:30;"Well, I would say your connection to Hershey"
07:30;07:31;"is tenuous."
07:31;07:33;"What is our connection to Hershey?"
07:33;07:35;"We're public critics of the company."
07:35;07:37;"We're basically journalists."
07:37;07:39;"Oh, wait, did we compromise our journalistic values?"
07:39;07:41;"Let's get Glenn Greenwald on the next episode"
07:41;07:45;"of talking about candy and ethics and journalism."
07:45;07:47;"Well, OK, we're going to have to unpack"
07:47;07:49;"a lot of the ethics of what it means that we're now"
07:49;07:50;"candy influencers."
07:50;07:52;"We're journalists and candy influencers."
07:52;07:53;"But go on."
07:53;07:53;"What are the other rules?"
07:53;07:55;"Yeah, let me just run through these fast."
07:55;07:56;"Number two is statements should be"
07:56;08:01;"honest and truthful opinions and actual experiences."
08:01;08:02;"OK."
08:02;08:02;"I like that."
08:02;08:06;"Statements should be factual and able to be verified."
08:06;08:09;"I will verify to you right now that this beer is terrible."
08:09;08:13;"Number four, you must not disclose any Hershey"
08:13;08:14;"confidential information."
08:14;08:15;"Do we have any?"
08:15;08:19;"Will we ever be given any?"
08:19;08:23;"You guys didn't get that other envelope of their stock?"
08:23;08:25;"We're arrested on insider trading"
08:25;08:29;"because we got to taste the mint Kit Kat early."
08:29;08:32;"We're just like, this is a winner right here."
08:32;08:34;"I have to say that mint Kit Kat was great."
08:34;08:36;"Did you like it?"
08:36;08:37;"I really liked it."
08:37;08:39;"Respect intellectual property rights."
08:39;08:41;"You are personally liable under federal and state"
08:41;08:45;"law for your actions with respect to your social media."
08:45;08:46;"That's a little scary."
08:46;08:49;"That's a little scary."
08:49;08:50;"Oh my god."
08:50;08:53;"We reserve the right to ask you to remove content."
08:53;08:56;"Lastly, you must follow the Hershey Company integration"
08:56;08:57;"guidelines."
08:57;08:58;"Not sure what that is."
08:58;09:00;"Sounds weighty."
09:00;09:03;"Maybe they didn't send me the guidelines on purpose."
09:03;09:07;"Maybe they were like, Jake's more of a loose cannon."
09:07;09:09;"We could see him really going off the reservation"
09:09;09:11;"writing some wild [BLEEP] and maybe they"
09:11;09:13;"knew like Ezra's a little more respectful."
09:13;09:15;"We don't need to like throw all the--"
09:15;09:17;"we literally don't need to throw the rule book at him."
09:17;09:18;"[MUSIC - ""HERSHEY""]"
09:18;09:19;"[RAPPING]"
09:21;09:24;"I came up in this bitch tongue, got wet out her front tooth"
09:24;09:28;"Now who they say is number one and flowing so he number two?"
09:28;09:30;"Yeah he dance good but guess where he got the moves?"
09:30;09:33;"But compared to me, look like he wear two left shoes"
09:33;09:36;"Boy I treat them love verses like the restrooms"
09:36;09:39;"Take my hand and dance with the devil"
09:39;09:41;"Oh boy you in trouble, rattle the lion cage"
09:41;09:44;"Oh gosh, break it down while you're praying on stage"
09:44;09:47;"Shit at your burial, smoke squares at your grave"
09:47;09:50;"Then repent for my sins like God I'm saved"
09:50;09:53;"He always forgive, later on I forget"
09:53;09:56;"I had my fingers crossed, so I'm back on that"
09:56;09:59;"Catch another body but a song didn't make"
09:59;10:02;"The ballets is the lyrics, turn the rapper to a spirit"
10:02;10:04;"Sing it with the angels, long gone"
10:04;10:08;"The songs like Bishop Eddie Long, where the thorns gone?"
10:08;10:12;"I'm the wrong one to run on, my mother's on her gig"
10:12;10:14;"Jack Nines, she playing bing bong"
10:14;10:15;"Seinfeld, he did?"
10:15;10:18;"I was gonna ask Seinfeld if he's looked up any"
10:18;10:21;"Online reviews of the Hershey's Yingling beer"
10:21;10:23;"I haven't, but I can look it up"
10:23;10:26;"But I have my own review, it's delicious"
10:26;10:30;"And I know that, I see that you liked it when you took a sip"
10:30;10:31;"I think this is disgusting"
10:31;10:34;"It's like normal beer but somebody put like a Hershey"
10:34;10:37;"No, I was gonna say the opposite"
10:37;10:40;"I feel it's a candy bar that people have poured beer on top of"
10:40;10:41;"Six of one"
10:41;10:42;"It's a little bit"
10:42;10:44;"Yeah, I can't finish it, I gotta switch gears"
10:44;10:46;"I'm gonna make a margarita"
10:46;10:47;"Ezra, weigh in"
10:47;10:51;"I legitimately enjoyed the mustard beer last time"
10:51;10:53;"Yeah, I wouldn't say this is great but I don't"
10:53;10:55;"I can't bring myself to hate it"
10:55;10:57;"I'm also wondering too like"
10:57;11:00;"This is a very naive question but"
11:00;11:02;"Very prominently on the upper label"
11:02;11:03;"On the beer"
11:03;11:07;"It says, very prominently, 21+ to enjoy"
11:07;11:11;"Does all beer say 21+?"
11:11;11:12;"No, no"
11:12;11:13;"I don't think so"
11:13;11:16;"No, I'm looking at a Pacifico"
11:16;11:19;"I think it's because it's candy"
11:19;11:22;"I didn't think I'd seen that before, 21+ to enjoy"
11:22;11:24;"Yeah, I wouldn't say it's great but at the same time"
11:24;11:26;"I'm legitimately curious"
11:26;11:30;"If I went to a bar and I wasn't staring at the Hershey's logo"
11:30;11:31;"And somebody was just like"
11:31;11:34;"I'm gonna get like a porter"
11:34;11:36;"Like some sh*t, I don't even really know what it means"
11:36;11:40;"Like I know a porter I assume is like richer than a pale ale"
11:40;11:42;"Than an IPA"
11:42;11:44;"If I was at a bar and some people were like"
11:44;11:46;"This round we're gonna get some porters, you want one?"
11:46;11:48;"And I'll say sure, I'll get whatever you guys get"
11:48;11:52;"And then somebody came down and plopped this in front of me in a glass"
11:52;11:53;"And I sipped it"
11:53;11:55;"I don't even know what I would think"
11:55;11:56;"I don't know if I'd be like"
11:56;11:58;"Damn, this is chocolatey and sweet"
11:58;12:00;"I think I'd just kind of like take it down"
12:00;12:02;"And barely even think about it"
12:02;12:03;"Like the first few sips I'd be like"
12:03;12:04;"God, this is nasty"
12:04;12:05;"But then I'd just be like"
12:05;12:07;"Well, I'm just gonna like adjust to it"
12:07;12:09;"And like, this is what I'm drinking"
12:09;12:12;"I don't think I would get to the point where I'm like"
12:12;12:13;"You know what? F this"
12:13;12:14;"I would just be like"
12:14;12:16;"Someone bought a round"
12:16;12:17;"It looks like Guinness or something"
12:17;12:18;"It's like really dark"
12:18;12:19;"You know?"
12:19;12:19;"Right"
12:19;12:23;"BeerAdvocate.com gives it an overall score of 88%"
12:23;12:24;"Very good"
12:24;12:25;"Damn"
12:25;12:29;"That's 138 reviews they've averaged that out of"
12:29;12:30;"The first comment says"
12:30;12:32;"Pours deep copper with a half inch tan head"
12:32;12:34;"Which dissipates moderate lacing"
12:34;12:35;"Aroma"
12:35;12:37;"Wait, what the f***"
12:37;12:39;"What is this psycho?"
12:39;12:41;"The top review says"
12:41;12:43;"Pours deep copper with a half inch tan head"
12:43;12:44;"Which dissipates moderate lacing"
12:44;12:45;"Hold on, what is this?"
12:45;12:46;"Wait, hold on"
12:46;12:47;"You gotta slow down, man"
12:47;12:49;"I don't even understand the syntax"
12:49;12:51;"Pours deep copper?"
12:51;12:54;"So it pours, the way it pours is like a deep copper"
12:54;12:55;"The color"
12:55;12:58;"Yeah, then the head is a half inch tan"
12:58;13:02;"Then aroma of dark cocoa, light roast malt"
13:02;13:04;"Taste follows nose"
13:04;13:06;"Dark cocoa, light roast malt"
13:06;13:08;"Also a bit of caramel"
13:08;13:09;"Thin body"
13:09;13:11;"Why does it sound like slam poetry?"
13:12;13:15;"The way you're reading it, it's like total slam poetry"
13:15;13:18;"Moderate lacing, pours deep copper"
13:18;13:24;"Hey, I completely agree with Peach63 on this one"
13:24;13:25;"Thin bodied, a bit sticky"
13:25;13:28;"Moderate carbonation, semi-sweet finish"
13:28;13:31;"Then they go on to say thin bodied for a porter"
13:31;13:32;"It is pretty good though"
13:32;13:35;"And I think they took the words right out of my mouth"
13:35;13:36;"Were the lacing?"
13:36;13:39;"Well, the lacing is really where I started to resonate"
13:39;13:41;"Wait, so what do you think lacing means?"
13:41;13:44;"Lacing is the residue left from the foam beer head"
13:44;13:45;"As you drink beer"
13:45;13:48;"If you pour this beer into a glass, you take a sip"
13:48;13:51;"The head is going to stick to the side of the glass"
13:51;13:54;"And if it sticks to the side of the glass"
13:54;13:56;"I guess that's a thick lacing"
13:56;13:59;"If it's lighter, if the residue is lighter"
13:59;14:01;"I guess that's a lighter lacing"
14:01;14:02;"Okay"
14:02;14:04;"Pours deep copper"
14:04;14:06;"That just makes me think of"
14:06;14:08;"Throwing copper"
14:08;14:09;"Dick, you know what throwing copper is?"
14:09;14:11;"Is that a live album?"
14:11;14:13;"Yes"
14:13;14:15;"Alright, I figured you'd get that"
14:15;14:18;"And for anybody who's not familiar with the band Live"
14:18;14:21;"This is not a live recording of some other band"
14:21;14:23;"This is a band called Live"
14:23;14:25;"It's actually a studio album"
14:25;14:26;"And you know what's cool?"
14:26;14:28;"That band is from Pennsylvania"
14:28;14:29;"Oh really?"
14:29;14:30;"Mm-hmm"
14:30;14:32;"Are they from like Philadelphia?"
14:32;14:34;"York, Pennsylvania"
14:34;14:36;"Yeah, like more rural"
14:36;14:38;"I feel like York is like greater Philly"
14:38;14:39;"Okay"
14:39;14:40;"That's not even that close"
14:40;14:41;"Interesting"
14:41;14:43;"Well shout out to Live"
14:43;14:44;"Ed Kowalczyk"
14:44;14:47;"When the rain crashes"
14:47;14:51;"Oh mother cry"
14:51;15:01;"This moment she's been waiting for"
15:01;15:13;"The angel opens her eyes"
15:13;15:18;"Pale blue colored eyes"
15:18;15:20;"Presents the circle"
15:20;15:23;"Puts the glory up to hide"
15:23;15:25;"Hide"
15:27;15:30;"Oh my feeling"
15:30;15:33;"Coming back again"
15:33;15:35;"Like a roller"
15:35;15:38;"Thunder chasing the wind"
15:38;15:40;"Force is pulling"
15:40;15:43;"From the center of the earth I guess"
15:43;15:48;"I can feel it"
15:48;15:54;"I can feel it"
15:54;15:56;"Alright, well enough about the beer"
15:56;16:00;"So Jake, have you just been eating the Kit Kats?"
16:00;16:02;"Have you worn the socks?"
16:02;16:06;"What's your relationship been like with this box?"
16:06;16:11;"I've made coffee using a pour over into the Kit Kat coffee mug"
16:11;16:12;"In my studio"
16:12;16:13;"Worked out great"
16:13;16:15;"Starting to cool down a little bit"
16:15;16:18;"So I'm starting to have hot coffee in the morning there"
16:18;16:20;"And so that's been great"
16:20;16:22;"I have not worn the socks yet"
16:22;16:23;"I'm loving the mint"
16:23;16:24;"I've had a few of those"
16:24;16:29;"And then the rest of them I dropped off at the art gallery that represents me"
16:29;16:33;"I dropped the box off with the rest of the Mocha Kit Kats"
16:33;16:36;"For the people that work there to enjoy"
16:36;16:40;"Because I don't need, you know, 20 Kit Kats in my house"
16:40;16:41;"Don't need it"
16:41;16:43;"You weren't interested in the Mocha flavor at all?"
16:43;16:44;"I tried it"
16:44;16:45;"Wait, you got it too?"
16:45;16:47;"Yeah, I'm part of the flavor club too"
16:47;16:49;"I think we all are"
16:49;16:51;"We're a majority of the flavor club"
16:51;16:53;"All four of us got it?"
16:53;16:55;"And Matt, the producer"
16:55;16:56;"Oh, you guys"
16:56;16:59;"There's five TC related people"
16:59;17:00;"Oh, I didn't understand this"
17:00;17:01;"Oh, I thought it was just me and Jake"
17:01;17:02;"I'm sorry"
17:02;17:06;"I didn't realize I was talking to fellow members of the Kit Kat flavor club"
17:06;17:07;"So, okay"
17:07;17:09;"So if it really is only 200 people"
17:09;17:13;"And five are part of the TC crew"
17:13;17:15;"Then let me get an actual number crunch"
17:15;17:20;"I think that makes us 2.5% of the KKFC"
17:20;17:22;"You are absolutely right, yeah"
17:22;17:24;"We're 2.5%?"
17:24;17:25;"Yeah"
17:25;17:26;"That's solid"
17:26;17:28;"We're the vocal minority"
17:28;17:30;"Wait, also, by the way"
17:30;17:33;"The Kit Kat club is a place"
17:33;17:35;"I guess there's a lot of places"
17:35;17:39;"There's a club in Berlin called the Kit Kat club"
17:39;17:44;"Opened in 1994 by Austrian pornographic filmmaker Simon Thor"
17:44;17:46;"And his life partner Kirsten Kruger"
17:46;17:50;"The Kit Kat club is said to attract patrons from all over Europe"
17:50;17:53;"And other parts of the world because of its music selection"
17:53;17:54;"Techno and trance music"
17:54;17:57;"And its sexually uninhibited parties"
17:57;17:58;"The motto of the club is"
17:58;18:00;"Do what you want but stay in communication"
18:00;18:04;"Guests are allowed to engage in sexual intercourse openly at the venue"
18:04;18:06;"Yeah, I'm just saying, Hershey's"
18:06;18:08;"You might wanna"
18:08;18:09;"I've never been there"
18:09;18:10;"I do remember being in Berlin"
18:10;18:12;"And hearing people talk about the Kit Kat club"
18:12;18:13;"I think also"
18:13;18:14;"Also famously"
18:14;18:15;"Okay, the Kit Kat club"
18:15;18:17;"In New York where Trump met Melania"
18:17;18:18;"In New York City"
18:18;18:19;"There's a Kit Kat"
18:19;18:21;"So there's Kit Kat clubs all over the place, huh?"
18:21;18:23;"I guess they're all named after"
18:23;18:26;"That's the name of the nightclub"
18:26;18:28;"In the musical Cabaret"
18:28;18:30;"Which I've never actually seen"
18:30;18:31;"I kinda wanna see it"
18:31;18:33;"But there's a burlesque theater"
18:33;18:36;"In Berlin in the 1930s during the ascent of the Nazi party"
18:36;18:38;"Also called the Kit Kat club"
18:38;18:40;"Okay, the original Kit Kat club"
18:40;18:44;"Was an early 18th century English club in London"
18:44;18:47;"With strong political and literary associations"
18:47;18:50;"Okay, so actually this raises a question for me"
18:50;18:52;"What does Kit Kat actually mean?"
18:52;18:54;"In 1705 Thomas Hurn wrote"
18:54;18:57;"The Kit Kat club got its name from Christopher Catling"
18:57;19:00;"Um, doesn't totally explain it"
19:00;19:02;"Oh, and I guess the nickname for Christopher is Kit"
19:02;19:06;"So, his name was Chris Kat"
19:06;19:08;"So his name was Kit Kat"
19:08;19:09;"So it's just somebody's name, I guess"
19:09;19:10;"Kit Kat"
19:10;19:12;"It sounds like you know what it means"
19:12;19:14;"Maybe because Kat is a word"
19:14;19:16;"I mean, this might be"
19:16;19:18;"For another episode we have to draw this out"
19:18;19:20;"I mean, what's the connection"
19:20;19:22;"Between the club and the candy?"
19:22;19:24;"Just real quick, I'm on the Kit Kat"
19:24;19:26;"For a type of food"
19:26;19:28;"Goes back to the 18th century when mutton pies"
19:28;19:30;"Known as Kit Kat were served at meetings"
19:30;19:32;"Of the Kit Kat club in London"
19:32;19:34;"And then Roundtree's"
19:34;19:36;"A confectionary company based in York"
19:36;19:38;"Whoa, this is getting weird"
19:38;19:39;"York, England"
19:39;19:42;"Not York, Pennsylvania where Live and Ed Kowalczyk are from"
19:42;19:45;"In 1911 a British company based in York"
19:45;19:47;"Trademarked the terms Kit Kat"
19:47;19:49;"And made the first Kit Kat bar"
19:49;19:51;"So Kit Kat comes from England"
19:51;19:53;"And it was a mutton pie?"
19:53;19:55;"The first food ever called a Kit Kat"
19:55;19:57;"Was a mutton pie served at the Kit Kat club"
19:57;19:59;"I love that"
19:59;20:01;"I guess that kind of makes sense"
20:01;20:03;"Like in the 18th century"
20:03;20:05;"We have a mutton pie called Kit Kat"
20:05;20:07;"And then 200 years later somebody's like"
20:07;20:09;"Kit Kat, it's like a fun name for a food"
20:09;20:11;"And now it's a candy"
20:11;20:12;"I love that"
20:12;20:14;"Does the Kit Kat flavor club"
20:14;20:16;"Go back to the original Kit Kat club?"
20:16;20:18;"Like have we come full circle?"
20:18;20:20;"Do you think that was an inspiration?"
20:20;20:22;"Oh yeah, no for sure"
20:22;20:24;"It's definitely like a literary political society"
20:24;20:27;"It says that members of the original Kit Kat club"
20:27;20:30;"In 18th century London"
20:30;20:32;"Were committed Whigs"
20:32;20:34;"Which was a political party"
20:34;20:36;"That actually existed in the US at some point"
20:36;20:38;"So the Whigs' origin"
20:38;20:40;"In constitutional monarchism"
20:40;20:42;"And opposition to absolute monarchy"
20:42;20:44;"I don't think that's true of all of us"
20:44;20:46;"I don't think any of us are absolute monarchists"
20:46;20:48;"Well Seinfeld, you're Canadian"
20:48;20:50;"So your relationship to the crown"
20:50;20:52;"Is a little different than us"
20:52;20:54;"But you're not an absolute monarchist, are you?"
20:54;20:56;"No, but I certainly feel an allegiance to the Commonwealth"
20:56;20:58;"Do you consider the Queen"
20:58;21:00;"To be your kind of like"
21:00;21:02;"Spiritual head of state or whatever?"
21:02;21:04;"Yeah, definitely"
21:04;21:06;"I mean she's on all the money"
21:06;21:08;"So it makes sense"
21:08;21:10;"Do you recognize her divine tower?"
21:10;21:12;"Okay, you're a constitutional monarchist"
21:12;21:14;"Maybe it isn't that"
21:14;21:16;"A million miles away"
21:16;21:18;"Alright, maybe we should hit up Hershey's and say"
21:18;21:20;"We've uncovered some sh*t"
21:20;21:22;"You guys starting a Kit Kat club"
21:22;21:24;"Is actually taking the whole Kit Kat journey full circle"
21:24;21:26;"And we'd like to do"
21:26;21:28;"A kind of literary salon"
21:28;21:30;"Pop-up in London"
21:30;21:32;"And we can invite"
21:32;21:34;"A lot of intellectuals and stuff"
21:34;21:36;"Wait, what if we found out"
21:36;21:38;"What if we found out"
21:38;21:40;"That the Kit Kat club"
21:40;21:42;"Is like five members of the Crisis crew"
21:42;21:44;"Salman Rushdie"
21:44;21:46;"[Laughter]"
21:46;21:48;"Carl Noseguard"
21:48;21:50;"Maybe the Queen"
21:50;21:52;"Prince William"
21:52;21:54;"When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle"
21:54;21:56;"Like renounced their titles"
21:56;21:58;"And moved to California"
21:58;22:00;"I think they also renounced their membership"
22:00;22:02;"In the Kit Kat Flavor Club"
22:02;22:04;"Interestingly"
22:04;22:06;"Ghislaine Maxwell's still a member though"
22:06;22:08;"[Laughter]"
22:10;22:12;"But I will say"
22:12;22:14;"That I"
22:14;22:16;"As far as these things go"
22:16;22:18;"Obviously outside of Seinfeld"
22:18;22:20;"None of us are huge fans of the beer"
22:20;22:22;"But I was very impressed"
22:22;22:24;"When we talked to Ryan Reese"
22:24;22:26;"Even though he wouldn't give us all the secrets"
22:26;22:28;"Of the Hershey's Corporation"
22:28;22:30;"You know I liked the way he thought it"
22:30;22:32;"Actually that conversation made me way more interested"
22:32;22:34;"In Hershey's as a company"
22:34;22:36;"And I gotta say the Kit Kat Flavor Club"
22:36;22:38;"As far as these kind of just like mail out things go"
22:38;22:40;"I think it was a very well made box"
22:40;22:42;"And the idea of being a member"
22:42;22:44;"Of a flavor club"
22:44;22:46;"Is exciting"
22:46;22:48;"Now I don't know if this is a one time thing"
22:48;22:50;"Being a member of a club"
22:50;22:52;"That kind of implies to me"
22:52;22:54;"That we're you know"
22:54;22:56;"Going to be regularly receiving"
22:56;22:58;"New Kit Kat boxes with different flavors"
22:58;23:00;"I posted about it"
23:00;23:02;"I didn't know that there were guidelines"
23:02;23:04;"I hope my post"
23:04;23:06;"On my Instagram story didn't break"
23:06;23:08;"Any of the guidelines I tried to keep it simple"
23:08;23:10;"But it definitely got me talking about Kit Kats"
23:10;23:12;"I did two stops"
23:12;23:14;"In my neighborhood"
23:14;23:16;"With people I knew"
23:16;23:18;"I did reverse trick or treating"
23:18;23:20;"Where I dropped off Kit Kats at their homes"
23:20;23:22;"So they basically got me"
23:22;23:24;"Poundin' the pavement now"
23:24;23:26;"Because I didn't want to eat all the Kit Kats"
23:26;23:28;"Because I try not to eat that much candy"
23:28;23:30;"That is the tough part of being a candy influencer"
23:30;23:32;"Is that we receive such a high volume"
23:32;23:34;"Of candy and we need to eat the candy"
23:34;23:36;"So that we can comment on it"
23:36;23:38;"And you know have hot takes"
23:38;23:40;"About the candy news of the day"
23:40;23:42;"But also as an influencer we have to look good"
23:42;23:44;"You know if you eat too many Kit Kats"
23:44;23:46;"You eat too much sugar"
23:46;23:48;"You can get kind of a bloated look"
23:48;23:50;"Your face doesn't look camera ready"
23:50;23:52;"So you know I've always been a little bit jealous"
23:52;23:54;"Of beauty influencers"
23:54;23:56;"Because everything's going in the same direction there"
23:56;23:58;"You're a beauty influencer"
23:58;24:00;"Your brand is beauty"
24:00;24:02;"You have to look good for the videos"
24:02;24:04;"It's all pushing in the same direction"
24:04;24:06;"Candy influencer you're being pulled in two different directions"
24:06;24:08;"You know what I mean?"
24:08;24:10;"It's hard work"
24:10;24:12;"And there are times that I regret becoming a candy influencer"
24:12;24:14;"You know I used to have a pretty good job"
24:14;24:16;"But uh"
24:16;24:18;"This is the life that we all chose"
24:18;24:20;"And honestly I'm very grateful"
24:20;24:22;"I feel like you could"
24:22;24:24;"I'm grateful too"
24:24;24:26;"You could easily use the candy influencer thing"
24:26;24:28;"To pivot into music"
24:28;24:30;"Or something though"
24:30;24:32;"If you wanted to use it as a springboard into entertainment"
24:32;24:34;"Just like the next time"
24:34;24:36;"There's a Vampire Weekend song"
24:36;24:38;"That is always a difficult one"
24:38;24:40;"We've all seen an influencer try to do it"
24:40;24:42;"Where I'm just like"
24:42;24:44;"Hey guys I know you mostly follow me for my candy"
24:44;24:46;"But some of you might know I'm also pretty passionate about music"
24:46;24:48;"Anyway my band's got a new single"
24:48;24:50;"Coming out"
24:50;24:52;"Please check it out"
24:52;24:54;"We'd really appreciate that"
24:54;24:56;"Stick to candy influencing dumbass"
24:56;24:58;"And then some people are trying to be nice"
24:58;25:00;"And they're like"
25:00;25:02;"Honestly I hear some Kit Kat influence in the music"
25:02;25:04;"And I'm just like"
25:04;25:06;"Uh well it's kind of a different part of my life"
25:06;25:08;"No totally"
25:08;25:10;"This is great music for when you're eating candy"
25:10;25:12;"And I'm like no"
25:12;25:14;"It's kind of it's own thing guys"
25:14;25:16;"And just like painfully trying to establish"
25:16;25:18;"Something outside of my life as a candy influencer"
26:00;26:06;"- You're listening to Time Crisis."
26:06;26:10;"- All right, so we got some great guests today."
26:10;26:12;"And the first one is somebody"
26:12;26:14;"who's loomed large on the program."
26:14;26:18;"We've heard his name before, and this is Jake's Uncle Ted."
26:18;26:18;"- That's right."
26:18;26:20;"- And we were talking about him most recently,"
26:20;26:23;"I think because we were mourning the passing"
26:23;26:24;"of rock legend Eddie Van Halen."
26:24;26:26;"You were talking Jake about the fact"
26:26;26:29;"that your Uncle Ted grew up in Pasadena"
26:29;26:30;"around the same time."
26:30;26:32;"- And is about the same age as those guys."
26:32;26:35;"And I definitely saw them play some early shows."
26:35;26:37;"- So let's get Uncle Ted on the phone."
26:37;26:40;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis hotline."
26:40;26:43;"(phone ringing)"
26:43;26:45;"- Yes, mom."
26:45;26:46;"- Ted."
26:46;26:47;"- Yes, hi."
26:47;26:48;"- What's up, man?"
26:48;26:49;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
26:49;26:51;"- (laughs) Thank you."
26:51;26:52;"- How's it going, Ted?"
26:52;26:53;"This is Ezra."
26:53;26:54;"- I'm good, man."
26:54;26:56;"- I guess my first question, you know,"
26:56;26:57;"and I'm sure the audience wants to know too,"
26:57;27:00;"is how exactly are you guys related?"
27:00;27:04;"- Jake and Dave are both my sister's kids."
27:04;27:09;"She had these amazing two monster kids."
27:09;27:10;"I'm very proud of both of them."
27:10;27:11;"- Thanks, Ted, that's sweet."
27:11;27:14;"- And how old were you when Jake was born?"
27:14;27:19;"- I was 16 in 1974 when Van Halen came out."
27:19;27:20;"Let's put it there."
27:20;27:23;"- So Jake was born in '77, so you were probably 19."
27:23;27:25;"- I was born in '58."
27:25;27:27;"- So you were growing up in Pasadena,"
27:27;27:28;"in the city of Pasadena?"
27:28;27:29;"- Absolutely."
27:29;27:32;"Hold on a second, I gotta plug this phone in."
27:32;27:36;"Power."
27:36;27:37;"All right, yeah, yes."
27:37;27:40;"The whole Van Halen thing was so cool."
27:40;27:41;"I mean, Eddie was a legend,"
27:41;27:44;"and we had all kind of guitar players"
27:44;27:48;"that were in his league that he pretty much blew away,"
27:48;27:51;"and they destroyed their careers."
27:51;27:52;"- You were like in high school,"
27:52;27:56;"and you were just hearing about this dude, Eddie Van Halen?"
27:56;27:59;"Did he like go to your high school?"
27:59;28:01;"- This is the bottom line with Van Halen."
28:01;28:02;"Quote me on this."
28:02;28:04;"They were the kings of the kegger."
28:04;28:06;"The best parties I've ever been to."
28:06;28:11;"Giant, monstrous, thousands of people parked for blocks."
28:11;28:14;"Then the police could do nothing about it."
28:14;28:16;"It was just insane."
28:16;28:17;"- I mean, this is the impression"
28:17;28:19;"that you always get from movies, like ""Dazed and Confused."""
28:19;28:22;"In the '70s, high school kids could basically"
28:22;28:25;"just throw gigantic parties with alcohol,"
28:25;28:26;"and it was kind of like,"
28:26;28:28;"it wasn't some huge scandalous thing."
28:28;28:29;"- For real."
28:29;28:31;"- And it didn't get shut down very often?"
28:31;28:32;"- Oh, it got shut down."
28:32;28:35;"The party would go on for like an hour,"
28:35;28:37;"and then the helicopters would show up,"
28:37;28:41;"and the cops would show up, and the kids would scatter."
28:41;28:42;"We did it every weekend."
28:42;28:44;"- And there would be live music?"
28:44;28:46;"You're saying Van Halen actually performed?"
28:46;28:48;"- Pretty much."
28:48;28:50;"I never saw Van Halen in a club."
28:50;28:53;"I always saw them in backyards,"
28:53;28:58;"at very large mansions, very expensive properties,"
28:58;29:00;"and they probably made a lot of money."
29:00;29:01;"The keggers were just ridiculous."
29:01;29:05;"They'd have 10 kegs and 1,000 people."
29:05;29:06;"It was ridiculous."
29:06;29:08;"And they charged five bucks a head to get in,"
29:08;29:10;"and guys would, you know,"
29:10;29:12;"they'd stamp your hand at the gate, right?"
29:12;29:15;"And then guys would go out and wet their finger"
29:15;29:20;"and try to transfer their stamp to the guy in the line"
29:20;29:24;"to get 'em for free, and then they'd both get thrown out."
29:24;29:25;"It was just, you know,"
29:25;29:30;"teenage monstrous ridiculousness."
29:30;29:32;"- And so you said that a lot of these parties"
29:32;29:33;"were happening at mansions."
29:33;29:36;"So Pasadena's generally a pretty wealthy town,"
29:36;29:38;"or is there like a right and wrong side"
29:38;29:40;"of the tracks kind of thing?"
29:40;29:42;"- Well, there's tracks in every town."
29:42;29:45;"Okay, there's one guy, his parents' house"
29:45;29:49;"was monstrous, and he had a Van Halen party"
29:49;29:54;"on their tennis court, and they put up a huge stage."
29:54;29:56;"And, you know, the tennis court has a gate,"
29:56;29:59;"a fence around it so the balls don't get up."
29:59;30:01;"But you could fit probably 300 people"
30:01;30:04;"into the tennis court area where the stage was,"
30:04;30:07;"and Van Halen was throwing down."
30:07;30:09;"But the party was going on outside the gate,"
30:09;30:13;"and there was, I'm 16 years old, I'm 17 years old."
30:13;30:16;"There was just chicks everywhere."
30:16;30:20;"Everybody's free beer, Van Halen."
30:20;30:21;"It's ridiculous."
30:21;30:25;"It's like Woodstock in a really rich neighborhood"
30:25;30:26;"for a (beep) free."
30:26;30:27;"(laughs)"
30:27;30:28;"It was great."
30:28;30:29;"- Damn."
30:29;30:31;"- I love the idea of Van Halen just performing"
30:31;30:33;"on a tennis court."
30:33;30:34;"- Yeah, man."
30:34;30:35;"- Tennis court metal."
30:35;30:39;"- They put up a pretty legit stage on a tennis court."

31:21;31:23;"It's the '80s."
31:23;31:25;"You're in your mid-20s."
31:25;31:29;"And you're seeing the video for Jump on MTV."
31:29;31:30;"Do you have a sense of pride?"
31:30;31:32;"You're like, ""My boys made it."""
31:32;31:33;"Or are you done at that point?"
31:33;31:36;"- By that time, I'm in my band, The Pimps."
31:36;31:38;"And we're doing funk music."
31:38;31:39;"- Great band."
31:39;31:41;"- So you were done with rock by that era?"
31:41;31:43;"- Oh yeah, we all grew up, right?"
31:43;31:45;"- Ted, I feel like you cycled through rock"
31:45;31:46;"into punk briefly,"
31:46;31:50;"and then you got really into like funk and like jocko."
31:50;31:54;"- I was, while people were doing all the rock and roll,"
31:54;31:58;"I was kind of in the fusion jazz scene."
31:58;31:59;"- Yeah."
31:59;32:01;"- And I was like, Mahavishnu Orchestra"
32:01;32:04;"and John LuPonte."
32:04;32:07;"That came out of my love from Frank Zappa."
32:07;32:09;"Quick brush with greatness."
32:09;32:11;"I got to sit in a box at the Hollywood Bowl"
32:11;32:14;"with George Duke and eat dinner."
32:14;32:15;"(laughs)"
32:15;32:16;"- Legend."
32:16;32:18;"- I will never forget that night."
32:18;32:21;"- So as you're getting into all this fusion music and stuff,"
32:21;32:23;"were you not in to Van Halen anymore?"
32:23;32:27;"Or would you be buying like a 1986 Van Halen record?"
32:27;32:30;"- Okay, my father worked for Warner Brothers Records."
32:30;32:33;"Actually, he worked for Warner Brothers Studios."
32:33;32:38;"But he brought home boxes of records every month."
32:38;32:41;"So we had every Warner Brothers release"
32:41;32:46;"that was ever released from like 1970 to 1990."
32:46;32:50;"Yeah, I take that to 80."
32:50;32:52;"But anyway, yeah, I had all the LPs."
32:52;32:54;"- So you would keep up to some extent with Van Halen."
32:54;32:56;"- Yeah, but the thing is,"
32:56;32:58;"I was exposed to all kinds of music."
32:58;33:00;"My dad was a jazz lover."
33:00;33:02;"You know, he was from South Africa."
33:02;33:04;"Then I got interested in African music"
33:04;33:07;"and King Sunny a Day and Fela and all that (beep)"
33:07;33:10;"and then Jocko was all part of that too."
33:10;33:14;"And so it's just my world opened up as a bass player"
33:14;33:18;"'cause it's so many things to be fascinated by."
33:18;33:18;"- Sure."
33:18;33:21;"- Ted, when did you first play the Old Town Pub?"
33:21;33:22;"- Okay, let's see."
33:22;33:25;"Early 80s probably."
33:25;33:28;"- Like did the Pimps?"
33:28;33:30;"- Oh, the Pimps, definitely playing there, yeah."
33:30;33:31;"- Okay."
33:31;33:32;"- Yeah, it's so much fun."
33:32;33:33;"They're a great bar."
33:33;33:36;"And I played there for many, many years"
33:36;33:39;"for many, many different bar owners."
33:39;33:41;"- And now you come and see Richard Pictures there"
33:41;33:42;"when we play."
33:42;33:46;"- And oh, sheesh, man."
33:46;33:48;"The backyard at the pub when you guys play there,"
33:48;33:51;"it just turns into ganja central."
33:51;33:51;"- Yeah."
33:51;33:54;"- And I have to brag at this point in the conversation,"
33:54;33:58;"Uncle Ted has grown a beautiful crop this year."
33:58;33:59;"- Nice, dude."
33:59;34:03;"- Where do you grow it, inside or outside?"
34:03;34:04;"- Outside, yeah."
34:04;34:06;"Yeah, in fabric pots."
34:06;34:08;"- And just so everybody knows,"
34:08;34:09;"especially if you're a California resident,"
34:09;34:12;"I always forget, but in California,"
34:12;34:14;"you're allowed to grow weed."
34:14;34:16;"What's the maximum number of plants?"
34:16;34:17;"- Six."
34:17;34:18;"- Okay."
34:18;34:19;"- I grew seven."
34:19;34:21;"(laughing)"
34:21;34:23;"- Nice, dude."
34:23;34:24;"- You're a rebel."
34:24;34:27;"- We've also adopted chickens."
34:27;34:29;"We're getting eggs every morning."
34:29;34:30;"- Whoa."
34:30;34:33;"- And we've got green onions going."
34:33;34:34;"We've got peppers."
34:34;34:38;"We're growing, it's like farmer Ted over here."
34:38;34:40;"- Dude, I gotta pop by and check this out."
34:40;34:41;"- You should."
34:41;34:43;"- I love the idea of just a functional farm"
34:43;34:48;"where it is chickens, vegetables, and weed."
34:48;34:49;"- But back to rock and roll."
34:49;34:50;"- Yes."
34:50;34:52;"- There were several cats in Pasadena"
34:52;34:55;"that were guitar player that sort of rivals"
34:55;34:57;"to Eddie Van Halen."
34:57;35:02;"They kind of warped, ruined their careers."
35:03;35:07;"Terry Kilgore had a band called Ready Killer Watt,"
35:07;35:09;"and they were just smoking."
35:09;35:14;"They played reggae music before it was even known here."
35:14;35:19;"And they had a cool chick singer named Debbie Diamond,"
35:19;35:24;"and they played just the same kind of backyard parties"
35:24;35:25;"that Van Halen did."
35:25;35:28;"But Eddie just killed them."
35:28;35:30;"(laughing)"
35:30;35:33;"But Eddie and Terry were good friends."
35:33;35:37;"And then there was another guy, a guy named Tom Tortomasi,"
35:37;35:40;"who I played with in SVDB."
35:40;35:44;"And Tom and Eddie were good friends."
35:44;35:46;"He was friends with Kilgore as well."
35:46;35:50;"And that was like kind of a guitar triumvirate"
35:50;35:52;"in Pasadena in the early '70s."
35:52;35:54;"Those guys were badasses."
35:54;35:58;"And so it was cool to sort of know some of them."
35:58;35:59;"- Yeah, man."
35:59;36:02;"I mean, I guess that's kind of just like, you know,"
36:02;36:04;"growing up in the same high school league"
36:04;36:05;"as like Michael Jordan."
36:05;36:07;"- Had to mention them, man."
36:07;36:10;"They were formative influences."
36:10;36:12;"- Are those guys still out there?"
36:12;36:15;"- Terry, no, not really."
36:15;36:17;"- Well, Ted, thanks so much for calling in."
36:17;36:18;"We gotta wrap it up 'cause we got our next guest."
36:18;36:22;"But where can people hear your music?"
36:22;36:23;"You got any new stuff up?"
36:23;36:28;"- T-E-D-K-N-E-C-H-T."
36:28;36:31;"And yeah, SoundCloud, Tech Connect."
36:31;36:33;"And I got some dubs up there."
36:33;36:34;"I've been working on 'em."
36:34;36:37;"I'm trying to learn Ableton and stuff"
36:37;36:40;"and working with some cats all over the world."
36:40;36:42;"It's kind of fun."
36:42;36:43;"- All right, sick."
36:43;36:45;"Well, we'll post the link on the Time Crisis Twitter."
36:45;36:48;"- Yeah, Ted, the stuff you sent today sounded sick."
36:48;36:50;"- Yeah, man, pump that link."
36:50;36:53;"- Will do, man."
36:53;36:56;"- Well, great to finally have you on the show, Ted."
36:56;36:58;"We hope you're calling again."
36:58;37:00;"- I appreciate you calling me, man."
37:00;37:01;"- All right, man."
37:01;37:02;"Ted, have a good one."

38:05;38:07;"Now we have the legendary Spike Ferristein."
38:07;38:10;"He's written on all the legendary shows."
38:10;38:14;"Letterman, SNL, The Simpsons, and most notably Seinfeld,"
38:14;38:16;"where he wrote some very famous episodes,"
38:16;38:21;"including The Soup Nazi, The Muffin Tops, The Little Kicks,"
38:21;38:24;"which is the one where Elaine dances at her company party."
38:24;38:26;"He also hosted the late night talk show"
38:26;38:29;"with Spike Ferristein on Fox from 2006 to 2009."
38:29;38:31;"He's got a podcast, Spike's Car Radio,"
38:31;38:35;"and he also hosts a TV show, Car Matchmaker,"
38:35;38:36;"on Esquire Network."
38:36;38:37;"Let's get him on the horn."
38:37;38:39;"Oh, and of course, as Seinfeld pointed out,"
38:39;38:43;"he co-wrote Bee Movie with Jerry, absolute legend."
38:43;38:46;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
38:46;38:49;"(phone ringing)"
38:49;38:51;"- Hey, Spike."
38:51;38:52;"- Hey, guys."
38:52;38:53;"- Welcome to Time Crisis."
38:53;38:54;"We're so happy to have you on."
38:54;38:56;"We really appreciate you taking the time."
38:56;38:57;"We always record late,"
38:57;38:59;"and you're in the middle of watching the World Series."
38:59;39:01;"So what's going on?"
39:01;39:03;"- Dodgers are down by a couple runs,"
39:03;39:06;"but this is my adopted team."
39:06;39:08;"I'm really a Boston Red Sox fan."
39:08;39:09;"You know, I like the Dodgers"
39:09;39:12;"'cause this is where my kids are growing up."
39:12;39:13;"- I've always wondered about that."
39:13;39:16;"Isn't it very easy to tell your children"
39:16;39:18;"your heritage lies in Boston,"
39:18;39:20;"and that's who you're gonna support,"
39:20;39:21;"that's who dad likes?"
39:21;39:22;"- It doesn't work."
39:22;39:24;"They are Red Sox fans"
39:24;39:27;"because they know my heart is with the Red Sox."
39:27;39:29;"But I do love the LA fans."
39:29;39:30;"I've lived in Los Angeles now longer"
39:30;39:33;"than I've lived anywhere else in the world."
39:33;39:34;"And I've seen the Red Sox win."
39:34;39:36;"You know, I've seen them do it a bunch of times"
39:36;39:37;"after not winning for decades."
39:37;39:41;"So I really want LA and the Dodgers"
39:41;39:43;"to have that win for all the folks"
39:43;39:45;"who've been waiting for the Dodgers to get it again."
39:45;39:46;"- And this could be their year."
39:46;39:49;"- It could be, but isn't a weird year to win anything?"
39:49;39:51;"(laughing)"
39:51;39:53;"- Yeah, I mean, will there literally be an asterisk"
39:53;39:55;"in the history books?"
39:55;39:57;"- No, but when they win,"
39:57;39:59;"I've been wondering, will the cardboard cutouts move"
39:59;40:01;"and go, ""Yay, up and down,"""
40:01;40:02;"and will they throw them off the field?"
40:02;40:05;"I mean, how is that celebrated?"
40:05;40:08;"I know that the writing will probably be real."
40:08;40:10;"(laughing)"
40:10;40:12;"But it's just such a, I don't know."
40:12;40:15;"I don't know that I'd wanna win the World Series this year."
40:15;40:16;"You know what I mean?"
40:16;40:18;"- I'm not a huge baseball guy,"
40:18;40:20;"but I think there should be an asterisk"
40:20;40:24;"because part of the stress of playing the World Series"
40:24;40:26;"in any baseball game is being surrounded"
40:26;40:28;"by tens of thousands of hardcore fans."
40:28;40:29;"- That is true."
40:29;40:33;"I know this guy, CJ Wilson, who pitched for the Angels,"
40:33;40:35;"and I ask him all sorts of questions like that,"
40:35;40:37;"but one of the things I asked him was,"
40:37;40:40;"out of all the kids who finally make it to the majors,"
40:40;40:43;"what percentage gets onto that mound?"
40:43;40:46;"And this is right after I had thrown a first pitch"
40:46;40:48;"at an Angels game and felt the weight"
40:48;40:50;"of being at the center of something like that"
40:50;40:52;"and how stressful it was."
40:52;40:54;"What percentage of guys get to the mound"
40:54;40:55;"and then fall apart?"
40:55;40:58;"And he said a very high percentage of guys do,"
40:58;40:59;"that they may have the talent,"
40:59;41:02;"but they just don't have the psychology to pull it off."
41:02;41:04;"Have you ever thrown out a first pitch?"
41:04;41:05;"- I'm sad to say the offers"
41:05;41:07;"never even come across my desk."
41:07;41:08;"- It's not a big deal,"
41:08;41:10;"but they have usually a bunch of guys."
41:10;41:12;"I did it once for a small game."
41:12;41:13;"It wasn't like the crowd,"
41:13;41:16;"but when I walked out there and I look,"
41:16;41:18;"and my friend CJ was catching,"
41:18;41:22;"it's like you're in a zoo and everybody's staring at you"
41:22;41:24;"in that cage and the fans,"
41:24;41:29;"you're at the center and the stress point of the whole game,"
41:29;41:30;"and you feel it."
41:30;41:31;"And I threw this, whatever,"
41:31;41:33;"I threw a strike or a ball, I don't even remember."
41:33;41:34;"I just remember going,"
41:34;41:36;"""God, I really wanna see my family right now."
41:36;41:38;"""I wanna get off this mound."
41:38;41:39;"""I wanna get off this field."""
41:39;41:41;"- I can only imagine."
41:41;41:43;"- Yeah, I just wanna eat a hot dog."
41:43;41:44;"- Oh, I bet."
41:44;41:45;"Anyway, that's enough sports talk."
41:45;41:47;"(laughing)"
41:47;41:50;"- Do you know that a member of our crew on the show"
41:50;41:52;"is named Seinfeld 2000?"
41:52;41:54;"- I did know that, yes,"
41:54;41:56;"but I don't know which box it is."
41:56;41:57;"- It's me in the box."
41:57;41:59;"I don't know, I might be in the bottom corner"
41:59;42:00;"of your screen."
42:00;42:01;"Spike, thanks for coming on Time Crisis."
42:01;42:03;"- Oh, that's the little box, okay."
42:03;42:05;"- Yeah, hi, how you doing?"
42:05;42:06;"(laughing)"
42:06;42:07;"- Oh, there you are."
42:07;42:08;"- Hi."
42:08;42:09;"- You're Seinfeld 2000."
42:09;42:12;"I can never tell what's real Seinfeld Twitter feeds"
42:12;42:13;"and what's fake Seinfeld."
42:13;42:15;"I assume you might be even a real guy."
42:15;42:17;"I know there's another guy."
42:17;42:19;"Are you the guy who's writing the new stories,"
42:19;42:21;"the new modern stories?"
42:21;42:23;"- I mean, that's part of what it is."
42:23;42:24;"It's kinda like--"
42:24;42:25;"- Well, I'll chime in."
42:25;42:26;"- Oh, thanks, Ezra."
42:26;42:29;"- The fastest way to describe where Seinfeld 2000 comes from"
42:29;42:34;"is that there was a guy who started doing the modern stories"
42:34;42:37;"and Seinfeld, as a deep Seinfeld fan,"
42:37;42:40;"found that to be so corny and disrespectful"
42:40;42:43;"of the source material that he started a kind of"
42:43;42:48;"unhinged Twitter persona that became its own thing,"
42:48;42:49;"but started out making fun"
42:49;42:52;"of the new Seinfeld Twitter account"
42:52;42:54;"and eventually became a kind of meme,"
42:54;42:58;"bizarre meme account that created its own universe."
42:58;43:01;"And he was the first person ever to take footage"
43:01;43:03;"from the real world, like Chris Christie"
43:03;43:05;"sitting next to Seinfeld"
43:05;43:07;"and do the curb your enthusiasm push."
43:08;43:11;"- Are you @Seinfeld2000?"
43:11;43:12;"- Yeah, that's me."
43:12;43:15;"Spike, you retweeted me, I think a few days ago."
43:15;43:17;"- Oh, the little kicks."
43:17;43:18;"- The little kicks, which you wrote."
43:18;43:21;"- I can't believe how my episodes are turning up"
43:21;43:22;"with the Lincoln Project."
43:22;43:24;"You know, the soup Nazi was the other day,"
43:24;43:26;"then the little kicks."
43:26;43:29;"It's so odd to keep seeing this stuff happen."
43:29;43:31;"- Let's break this down for the listeners."
43:31;43:32;"So the little kicks,"
43:32;43:37;"Elaine goes to her company party with George"
43:37;43:41;"and he sees that she's an insanely terrible dancer,"
43:41;43:44;"which is what the little kicks refer to one of her moves."
43:44;43:46;"She's doing these little kicks"
43:46;43:49;"and she doesn't realize what a terrible dancer she is"
43:49;43:51;"and George cannot believe it."
43:51;43:53;"Seinfeld, you're kind of our meme correspondent."
43:53;43:54;"The reason that this is back out"
43:54;43:56;"in the public consciousness"
43:56;43:58;"is because people are comparing Trump's dance moves"
43:58;44:00;"to Elaine's little kicks."
44:00;44:02;"- Yeah, yeah, President Donald J. Trump"
44:02;44:04;"has recently been like doing,"
44:04;44:06;"pulling out the-"
44:06;44:07;"- I still laugh when people say that,"
44:07;44:08;"but go ahead."
44:08;44:10;"(laughing)"
44:10;44:11;"- I don't know what's going on,"
44:11;44:13;"but there's some sort of collapse happening"
44:13;44:14;"where recently at rallies,"
44:14;44:19;"he's been doing these very unusual dances to YMCA."
44:19;44:22;"It seems like some sort of sign that, I don't know,"
44:22;44:23;"maybe the end is near."
44:23;44:26;"I don't know, but I guess it had been remarked on"
44:26;44:28;"that some of these moves that he was doing"
44:28;44:30;"were very like herky-jerky"
44:30;44:32;"and seemed very much like the motions"
44:32;44:36;"that Elaine was doing when she did the little kicks."
44:36;44:38;"And so I had tweeted out a split screen"
44:38;44:41;"of the two things happening simultaneously."
44:41;44:43;"And then the Lincoln Project, as you said,"
44:43;44:46;"kind of like did the thing where they tweet the video."
44:46;44:49;"And then Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the queen herself,"
44:49;44:50;"added her own commentary."
44:50;44:52;"And it was like a big-"
44:52;44:52;"- Yeah, it was a big moment."
44:52;44:54;"- Oh wait, so the Lincoln Project"
44:54;44:56;"was kind of retweeting you, Seinfeld?"
44:56;44:58;"- Yeah, I mean it's- - Or they stole your content?"
44:58;45:00;"- No, they do steal a lot of content,"
45:00;45:01;"but this time they did the thing"
45:01;45:04;"where you can kind of like sample the original video"
45:04;45:06;"so that the credit still goes to the original."
45:06;45:08;"It's very tedious to talk about."
45:08;45:10;"- Okay, all right. - But I have no qualms"
45:10;45:13;"with the way the Lincoln Project handled this one."
45:13;45:15;"But yeah, it's sort of like,"
45:15;45:17;"it got pushed through the Lincoln Project"
45:17;45:20;"and then Julia Louis-Dreyfus retweeted it."
45:20;45:22;"And it was, you know, it really made my week."
45:22;45:24;"It really made my- - Yeah, well, all right."
45:24;45:26;"Shout out to the Lincoln Project,"
45:26;45:27;"a group of Republicans who are-"
45:27;45:29;"(laughing)"
45:29;45:30;"They were cool with-"
45:30;45:32;"- They do the best ads. - George W. Bush."
45:32;45:33;"- They're so good."
45:33;45:36;"- Ronald Reagan, the, you know, the Rack Lord."
45:36;45:37;"- What is it?"
45:37;45:40;"It's like the enemy of my enemy is my friend kind of thing."
45:40;45:42;"I think that's kind of what's going on."
45:42;45:43;"- All we have right now."
45:43;45:45;"- Right, exactly. (laughing)"
45:45;45:47;"- You just gotta hold onto 'em."
45:47;45:49;"- Right, so Spike, this is,"
45:49;45:50;"I'm sure you've answered this a million times,"
45:50;45:53;"but this is kind of a basic question is,"
45:53;45:55;"let's use the little kicks, for instance."
45:55;45:57;"On a TV show like ""Seinfeld,"""
45:57;45:59;"and you came in in the last two seasons"
45:59;46:00;"or last three seasons, something like that."
46:00;46:01;"- Three, season seven."
46:01;46:05;"- When you write an episode, like how does that come about?"
46:05;46:07;"Does that mean that, did you get to write it"
46:07;46:09;"because you threw out the original idea?"
46:09;46:13;"Was it assigned to you 'cause it was your turn to do it?"
46:13;46:15;"Did it all get cooked up together,"
46:15;46:16;"but you're the one who put words to paper"
46:16;46:19;"and kind of formalized it?"
46:19;46:20;"What was going on back then?"
46:20;46:22;"- No, we would come in with the stories."
46:22;46:23;"- Okay. - It's pretty much"
46:23;46:24;"the qualification."
46:24;46:27;"You had to come in with stories, ideally from your life,"
46:27;46:31;"things that had happened to you that you thought were odd"
46:31;46:32;"or perhaps made you mad,"
46:32;46:35;"and maybe you didn't say what you wanted to say,"
46:35;46:37;"but you're telling Larry and Jerry,"
46:37;46:39;"but here's what I wanted to do."
46:39;46:42;"She said this to me, and here's what I wanted to do."
46:42;46:43;"So the very first story I was telling"
46:43;46:45;"was the story of this guy who sold soup"
46:45;46:47;"and everybody called him the Soup Nazi,"
46:47;46:49;"and if you didn't follow the rules,"
46:49;46:50;"he would scream at you,"
46:50;46:52;"and then Larry started laughing right away."
46:52;46:53;"He goes, ""The Soup Nazi?"
46:53;46:55;"""What did they, is it a guy they called?"""
46:55;46:56;"You know, and he goes, ""This is your first story."""
46:56;46:57;"And I go, ""I'm not pitching."
46:57;47:00;"""I was just telling you what's going on in New York"
47:00;47:01;"""where we got lunch every day."""
47:01;47:03;"That's your first story, and they throw you out."
47:03;47:05;"So you would then take that and go,"
47:05;47:08;"""All right, well, whose story is it?"
47:08;47:11;"""Out of these four characters, who's who?"""
47:11;47:13;"Well, George is gonna be arrogant enough to go,"
47:13;47:14;"""Look, I know how to order soup, right?"""
47:14;47:16;"Which really is me."
47:16;47:18;"That's what I did when someone told me about it."
47:18;47:20;"I'm George, and then I became Jerry, which is,"
47:20;47:24;"""Look, trust me, you gotta know what you're doing here."""
47:24;47:27;"And you know, Elaine, of course, the guy's a misogynist."
47:27;47:28;"She wouldn't put up with it,"
47:28;47:31;"and Kramer, a kindred spirit, right?"
47:31;47:33;"He's a misunderstood genius, this guy."
47:33;47:35;"You would start with those ideas"
47:35;47:38;"and see if you could get to the act break, right?"
47:38;47:40;"And in this particular case,"
47:40;47:43;"the act break bumped into the other story, ""Shmoopy,"""
47:43;47:46;"and all I knew was that Jerry has to make a choice,"
47:46;47:49;"the soup or the girl, and he chooses the soup."
47:49;47:51;"So that's where I knew I was going."
47:51;47:54;"And then you would map out act one and the scenes"
47:54;47:55;"and the basic idea of what's gonna happen in it."
47:55;47:57;"You're not typing."
47:57;47:58;"Dry erase boards."
47:58;48:00;"And then you'd bring Larry and Jerry in and go,"
48:00;48:01;"""Here's what I've got."""
48:01;48:04;"And they would throw in ideas."
48:04;48:06;"Before that, you'd bring in the other writers,"
48:06;48:08;"you know, guys, Gamble and Pross,"
48:08;48:09;"Berg and Schaefer, those guys."
48:09;48:11;"It was very collaborative in that way."
48:11;48:13;"They'd hang out in my office for an hour."
48:13;48:16;"I'd go into somebody else's office, help them with theirs,"
48:16;48:17;"and we'd talk out these stories"
48:17;48:22;"until you had a solid act one approved by Larry and Jerry"
48:22;48:24;"and a direction for act two."
48:24;48:25;"And who cares about the ending?"
48:25;48:27;"Nobody cares right now."
48:27;48:29;"And then if you had that,"
48:29;48:31;"and Larry and Jerry liked where it was going,"
48:31;48:33;"they would send you to script and you'd do a first draft."
48:33;48:37;"Second draft, they'd keep reading, they'd keep noting."
48:37;48:39;"And then eventually they'd go, ""You know what?"
48:39;48:41;"""Close enough."
48:41;48:42;"""We're gonna shoot it."
48:42;48:44;"""Let us do our pass."""
48:44;48:49;"And that's where it went from, you know, 75% to 110%,"
48:49;48:51;"if there's such a thing, right?"
48:51;48:54;"The real Jerry and George would take it by themselves"
48:54;48:57;"and jam on it in that, that's how season seven worked."
48:57;49:00;"In season eight, it became more collaborative."
49:00;49:03;"We would have teams of four writers working on a script"
49:03;49:06;"and whoever's script it was would EP it."
49:06;49:08;"So essentially, if it was my script,"
49:08;49:10;"I would be the EP for that week"
49:10;49:12;"and I would, you know, pick my little team of writers"
49:12;49:14;"and Jerry and I would do it."
49:14;49:16;"- It changed because Larry was gone."
49:16;49:18;"- Larry took off, yeah, yeah."
49:18;49:20;"He left after season seven."
49:20;49:23;"So, you know, again, the guiding principle though"
49:23;49:26;"that Larry and Jerry put out was really amazing,"
49:26;49:29;"which was we don't want you to make up stupid stories"
49:29;49:32;"about who dates who or what happened."
49:32;49:35;"We want you to bring in real stories from your life,"
49:35;49:38;"ideally from New York, where I had just moved from,"
49:38;49:40;"and just tell us those stories"
49:40;49:42;"and let us decide whether it's something or not."
49:42;49:45;"I mean, you could exact revenge on friends."
49:45;49:48;"You could have so much fun with that thing that,"
49:48;49:51;"you know, I remember the minute Jeff Schafer's like,"
49:51;49:52;"""You gotta listen to my friends."""
49:52;49:53;"- Yeah, yeah."
49:53;49:54;"- And I was like, ""I'm gonna listen to you."""
49:54;49:55;"And then we would play it."
49:55;49:57;"We were like, ""Play the answering machine message."""
49:57;50:00;"And it was that, ""Believe it or not, I'm not gonna be home."""
50:00;50:01;"Some girly dude."
50:01;50:02;"- Classic."
50:02;50:05;"- And we would play it, you know, every day before we wrote,"
50:05;50:07;"we were like, ""Play the answering machine message."""
50:07;50:09;"And eventually we were so entertained, you know,"
50:09;50:11;"""George, let's give that to George."""
50:11;50:12;"Look at how small that is."
50:12;50:14;"That's just a girl living in Sherman Oaks"
50:14;50:17;"who made a bad decision for her answering machine."
50:17;50:19;"And then we shoot the episode"
50:19;50:21;"and Schafer and I close the door"
50:21;50:23;"off ""Seinfeld"" tonight and just hang the phone up."
50:23;50:25;"(laughing)"
50:25;50:28;"She had, you know, her mind was blown, of course,"
50:28;50:32;"but, you know, it was a really fun little environment"
50:32;50:33;"to work in, you know,"
50:33;50:36;"I've never worked on anything like it since, really."

51:11;51:12;"- Yeah, it's Lorne Michaels."
51:12;51:15;"It's Lorne Michaels when I was working at Saturday Night Live."
51:15;51:16;"I was an intern there"
51:16;51:18;"and he was a very intimidating character to me,"
51:18;51:20;"not because of how he acted,"
51:20;51:22;"just because I had grown up watching the show"

51:29;51:30;"So it's like, you know,"
51:30;51:33;"and I'd never seen anybody in show business"
51:33;51:35;"and he was, I just, I couldn't even look at him."
51:35;51:36;"I was intimidated."
51:36;51:40;"And then one night I saw him at the party dancing,"
51:40;51:42;"doing the dance that Elaine is doing."
51:42;51:44;"Very accurate."
51:44;51:48;"With these little kicks and-"
51:48;51:50;"- Like that extreme, that ridiculous?"
51:50;51:53;"- The kicks were the primary,"
51:53;51:55;"those were in the script, the kicks."
51:55;51:55;"That's what it's called."
51:55;51:57;"- Specifically the kicks."
51:57;51:59;"- He was doing this little kick thing."
51:59;52:01;"Julia, of course, took it to a new level,"
52:01;52:03;"but she didn't take it that much higher"
52:03;52:05;"than it already was."
52:05;52:06;"You know, I kind of admired Lorne"
52:06;52:08;"that he was just out there."
52:08;52:09;"He may or may not know,"
52:09;52:11;"but probably knew he wasn't that great of a dancer."
52:11;52:13;"And he was just, who cares?"
52:13;52:14;"Having a good time out there."
52:14;52:17;"But, you know, right away when I saw him"
52:17;52:19;"and some of the other, you know, PAs were like,"
52:19;52:20;"oh, he's not so scary anymore."
52:20;52:21;"He's human, right?"
52:21;52:23;"It kind of humanized him."
52:23;52:25;"And for the story with Elaine,"
52:25;52:28;"she at the time was running, you know, was a boss."
52:28;52:30;"And we thought that'll be an interesting thing"
52:30;52:31;"for her to play."
52:31;52:34;"She's got control and then she loses control."
52:34;52:35;"And we changed it."
52:35;52:36;"We exaggerated it a little bit,"
52:36;52:38;"but that was the basic idea."
52:38;52:41;"- Spike, were there any stories from like your real life"
52:41;52:43;"that you thought, oh, this is really like a gold,"
52:43;52:45;"like this is perfect fodder for a plot line"
52:45;52:47;"that you pitched to Larry and Jerry"
52:47;52:49;"and they just weren't feeling it at all?"
52:49;52:50;"- Oh yeah, yeah."
52:50;52:51;"- What could have been?"
52:51;52:52;"- The little kicks was the,"
52:52;52:53;"I pitched that in the first season"
52:53;52:55;"and Larry didn't understand it."
52:55;52:57;"And it, you know, I get, it's hard."
52:57;52:59;"These stories are really hard"
52:59;53:02;"to see how they're going to be funny, right?"
53:02;53:03;"And Larry would do the same for me."
53:03;53:05;"I remember a story falling out and he goes,"
53:05;53:08;"he goes, you know what, just come up with a blazer story."
53:08;53:10;"And I was like, what the (beep) are you talking about?"
53:10;53:12;"What is a blazer story?"
53:12;53:14;"He goes, all right, I don't know what this is,"
53:14;53:16;"but I think it's going to be funny."
53:16;53:19;"I went to Barney's and I tried on this crested blazer"
53:19;53:20;"and I thought it was cool."
53:20;53:22;"And then I realized it wasn't cool."
53:22;53:23;"And I said, you know what, I don't want this."
53:23;53:26;"And the guy made me feel like I couldn't afford it."
53:26;53:27;"So I bought it out of spite."
53:27;53:29;"(laughing)"
53:29;53:31;"And then I had this expensive blazer I didn't want"
53:31;53:33;"and I wanted to return it,"
53:33;53:34;"but I was too afraid to return it,"
53:34;53:36;"but I wanted to return it."
53:36;53:39;"And that became that crested blazer story of his."
53:39;53:40;"And I was dubious."
53:40;53:44;"I did not believe that he had a real story,"
53:44;53:47;"but yet when we shot it, I was like, right,"
53:47;53:50;"you know, the smaller these things are, the better,"
53:50;53:53;"but they're really difficult to see."
53:53;53:55;"You know, it's hard to put your faith"
53:55;53:57;"in a little story like that."
53:57;53:59;"So, you know, I didn't blame Larry at all for that."
53:59;54:01;"And I was happy to kind of repitch it."
54:01;54:04;"You know, I can't take my mind off Jeffrey Toobin right now."
54:04;54:05;"You know, that's the one."
54:05;54:07;"(laughing)"
54:07;54:08;"- I bet."
54:08;54:11;"- Boy, Zoom and those etiquettes,"
54:11;54:14;"and here's a guy who's touching himself."
54:14;54:18;"It's, you know, that's a great little story area."
54:18;54:20;"I'm guessing Curb is gonna hit this stuff,"
54:20;54:22;"you know, every which way."
54:22;54:24;"The name, the unfortunate name, Toobin."
54:24;54:25;"(laughing)"
54:25;54:26;"- Right."
54:26;54:28;"- You know, we thought Anthony Weiner was the end of it."
54:28;54:30;"Now we've got Toobin."
54:30;54:32;"I've been thinking a lot about harebrained kind of,"
54:32;54:35;"you know, these scooter sharing programs"
54:35;54:36;"really make me laugh"
54:36;54:38;"as they're handing things"
54:38;54:40;"that people are killing themselves on,"
54:40;54:42;"just going, ""Hey, it's Silicon Valley."
54:42;54:44;"We don't have to follow the rules."""
54:44;54:46;"You know, it never turns off."
54:46;54:48;"- There's a great, really small moment"
54:48;54:49;"in the new season of Curb"
54:49;54:52;"where Larry is just like strolling down the street with Leon"
54:52;54:54;"and there are those scooter shares"
54:54;54:57;"and he just knocks over a whole rack of them."
54:57;55:00;"It was such a small thing that they don't even comment on."
55:00;55:02;"- There are a lot of guys on Instagram"
55:02;55:05;"who that's their whole feed."
55:05;55:05;"It's great."
55:05;55:06;"It's just people,"
55:06;55:08;"scooters behaving badly is one of them"
55:08;55:11;"and they're just kicking scooters over all day long."
55:11;55:12;"It's really wonderful."
55:12;55:13;"But you know,"
55:13;55:16;"it's more about the arrogance of Silicon Valley"
55:16;55:17;"and just doing (beep)"
55:17;55:19;"we don't have to follow the rules, right?"
55:19;55:22;"That hasn't been written about enough, comedically."
55:22;55:24;"- That is also one of the things you're just like,"
55:24;55:25;"""Why is this allowed?"""
55:25;55:27;"- It's not."
55:27;55:29;"Their whole attitude is it's not."
55:29;55:31;"They just do it"
55:31;55:33;"and hope that we'll love the stuff enough"
55:33;55:35;"that later when the fines come,"
55:35;55:37;"that the cities will negotiate."
55:37;55:39;"- And they'll have so much money,"
55:39;55:41;"they can pay the fines and pay the politicians."
55:41;55:43;"- Yeah, but I was talking to Jerry just today"
55:43;55:44;"and he was like,"
55:44;55:47;"""Do you have these motorized or electric scooters?"
55:47;55:48;"These ride on ones?"""
55:48;55:49;"He said, he goes,"
55:49;55:51;"""I saw like a dad with two kids,"
55:51;55:54;"no helmets, just whizzing in and out of traffic."""
55:54;55:55;"And I'm like, ""How does it happen?"""
55:55;55:56;"He goes, ""I don't know."
55:56;55:57;"I don't know what's happened."
55:57;56:00;"They just dumped the scooters in Times Square, Spike."
56:00;56:01;"What are they doing?"""
56:01;56:04;"And that's where it starts."
56:04;56:06;"And then we went on a long Tubin."
56:06;56:08;"We were talking about Tubin"
56:08;56:10;"and how the funny part of,"
56:10;56:15;"is it okay to speak however I wish to speak here?"
56:15;56:16;"Do you have any sort of censorship?"
56:16;56:17;"- Yeah, yeah, no, no, no."
56:17;56:21;"- We're talking about the fallout from (beep) to Zoom"
56:21;56:24;"when Russ from accounting suddenly comes full on your screen"
56:24;56:25;"at a peak moment."
56:25;56:27;"(laughing)"
56:27;56:30;"Tubin, how is he timing stuff out?"
56:30;56:33;"(laughing)"
56:33;56:35;"- Do you think Tubin comes back from this?"
56:35;56:37;"Is there a Tubin comeback or is Tubin done?"
56:37;56:38;"- No, Tubin's done."
56:38;56:39;"Tubin's a meme at this point."
56:39;56:41;"- So Spike, now you have a podcast"
56:41;56:43;"and a TV show about cars."
56:43;56:44;"- Yes."
56:44;56:46;"That show is no longer on the air"
56:46;56:47;"'cause the network got canceled."
56:47;56:48;"(laughing)"
56:48;56:49;"- Oh, they canceled the whole network?"
56:49;56:50;"- They canceled the network."
56:50;56:53;"The show's fine, but there's no network."
56:53;56:56;"You know, I thought I had seen everything in entertainment,"
56:56;56:58;"but I've never seen the show be a hit"
56:58;56:59;"and the network get canceled."
56:59;57:01;"That's a first for me."
57:01;57:02;"- Where can one watch it now?"
57:02;57:05;"- We have three seasons up, you know, on whatever sites."
57:05;57:07;"It's still shown around the world and stuff,"
57:07;57:11;"but you know, the whole car thing is just a hobby of mine."
57:11;57:14;"I'm, you know, still in entertainment."
57:14;57:17;"I have a scripted, an unscripted TV company."
57:17;57:18;"I'm writing scripted comedy."
57:18;57:20;"I'm working on a movie right now."
57:20;57:23;"The car thing is just a distraction"
57:23;57:25;"that started back when I was writing for Letterman."
57:25;57:27;"Dave likes cars and that's what we were kind of doing"
57:27;57:29;"in our downtime, just looking at cars"
57:29;57:30;"'cause you never leave the office."
57:30;57:33;"And then when I went to Seinfeld, it was the same thing."
57:33;57:36;"Who drove it in the old Porsche?"
57:36;57:38;"Hi, new writer, Spike Fersen."
57:38;57:39;"Oh, great, come here."
57:39;57:40;"You gotta get rid of that car though."
57:40;57:41;"It's a piece of (beep)"
57:41;57:42;"Like what?"
57:42;57:45;"Just don't fire me, dude."
57:45;57:48;"So, you know, the whole car thing"
57:48;57:50;"looks bigger than it actually is."
57:50;57:51;"Let me just put it that way, but I love it."
57:51;57:53;"It's my golf."
57:53;57:57;"- On this show, I don't think anybody is truly a car guy,"
57:57;58:00;"but we have talked about cars once or twice."
58:00;58:02;"We don't know what we're talking about at all."
58:02;58:03;"We're definitely out of our depth,"
58:03;58:08;"but I've always felt like I'm missing a well of experience"
58:08;58:10;"or information to make like, you know,"
58:10;58:13;"I got strong opinions about music and movies"
58:13;58:16;"and I can compare things and say, well, that sucks."
58:16;58:19;"But when it comes to cars, I feel like it's a language"
58:19;58:20;"I don't totally understand."
58:20;58:21;"I'll throw something at you."
58:21;58:23;"Lately, I've met a couple of cool people"
58:23;58:28;"who are very into vintage land cruisers."
58:28;58:29;"And there's something about that there."
58:29;58:31;"I was like, oh, that's interesting."
58:31;58:32;"Being into a Toyota Land Cruiser."
58:32;58:33;"Then you look at them,"
58:33;58:35;"they kind of have an interesting history."
58:35;58:38;"So I'm curious, to you, what does it connote"
58:38;58:42;"to be into a vintage Toyota Land Cruiser,"
58:42;58:44;"like a 60s or 70s Land Cruiser?"
58:44;58:45;"- Those are great."
58:45;58:47;"I mean, they're very popular trucks."
58:47;58:49;"- What's different about them and a Range Rover?"
58:49;58:51;"- Well, Land Rover, I have an old Land Rover."
58:51;58:53;"It's like any guitar that someone chooses."
58:53;58:55;"There's so much great stuff."
58:55;58:59;"Like for me, the car thing is not, I like Jay Leno a lot."
58:59;59:00;"I'm not a car guy like Jay Leno."
59:00;59:02;"I'm not interested in how engines work"
59:02;59:05;"and I get bored during these technical presentations."
59:05;59:09;"I'm more interested in the experience of using the vehicle."
59:09;59:12;"Like the car thing for me began when I had a vehicle"
59:12;59:16;"to drive away from my parents and to put my friends in"
59:16;59:20;"and smoke a little weed and listen to Led Zeppelin"
59:20;59:23;"and Madison Square Garden on the radio"
59:23;59:24;"in the middle of the woods."
59:24;59:26;"Like to me, that was like, wow, cars."
59:26;59:27;"(laughing)"
59:27;59:29;"Right, 'cause I get away."
59:29;59:31;"And then later on, it became a way to just be"
59:31;59:33;"with your friends and get out of the house."
59:33;59:36;"So I've always just loved vehicles"
59:36;59:38;"because they do things like that."
59:38;59:42;"The car community wraps its arms around pretty much anybody"
59:42;59:44;"at any level, whatever car they like."
59:44;59:47;"If you like driving around in your Prius, that's cool."
59:47;59:50;"Whatever, man, whatever you like."
59:50;59:53;"The Land Cruiser guys, those do really well at auction"
59:53;59:55;"and they have a big audience around the world."
59:55;59:58;"- What's like the (beep) car that you're into?"
59:58;59:59;"- That I'm into?"
59:59;01:00:01;"Then it wouldn't be a (beep) car."
01:00:01;01:00:02;"Like, what do you mean?"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"- What's like the lowest level, least fancy,"
01:00:04;01:00:08;"least celebrated car that you have a personal affinity for?"
01:00:08;01:00:11;"The cars that don't do well at auction,"
01:00:11;01:00:12;"that don't even go to auction."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"Is there, you know?"
01:00:13;01:00:16;"- I don't know that I like cars like that."
01:00:16;01:00:19;"I can't remember posting something"
01:00:19;01:00:22;"that people were actually upset about."
01:00:22;01:00:23;"(laughing)"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"- Or just like, I mean, is there like--"
01:00:25;01:00:28;"- Like a '92 Mercury Sable."
01:00:28;01:00:29;"Is that when you're like, you know,"
01:00:29;01:00:29;"say what you will, but like--"
01:00:29;01:00:30;"- I would not be passionate,"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"no, I wouldn't be passionate about that."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"I might buy a Ford Granada"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"because my dad had one growing up"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"that was filled with cigarette butts"
01:00:38;01:00:39;"and had cigarette holes in the seats."
01:00:39;01:00:41;"And that would be personal to me"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"and I would get made fun of for that."
01:00:43;01:00:46;"It's not at all collectible in any way."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"And it's a horrific vehicle."
01:00:47;01:00:50;"There is a car that I owned in New York"
01:00:50;01:00:53;"that is laughed at now, the Maserati Bi-Turbo"
01:00:53;01:00:55;"that Chrysler was involved in."
01:00:55;01:00:58;"It was a horrible, horrible car"
01:00:58;01:00:59;"that broke down constantly."
01:00:59;01:01:03;"And I am made fun of for that, owning that car."
01:01:03;01:01:06;"- Isn't Maserati like super high-end?"
01:01:06;01:01:09;"- No, not necessarily. - No."
01:01:09;01:01:11;"- Not at that period when they were making these things."
01:01:11;01:01:14;"- Is there a minivan that people covet?"
01:01:14;01:01:18;"- Yeah, people like the Honda Odyssey a lot."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"They're pretty passionate about that."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"- I've had two of those."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"But yeah, but those aren't collectibles."
01:01:23;01:01:26;"- No, collectible things tend to be something"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"that numbers in the, let's say,"
01:01:28;01:01:33;"let's just call this line 1,500 made per year, right?"
01:01:33;01:01:37;"And ideally, you're talking about cars"
01:01:37;01:01:40;"one to maybe 20 were made are the most collectible things."
01:01:40;01:01:42;"Anything that's a production car"
01:01:42;01:01:44;"where they're making tens of thousands,"
01:01:44;01:01:45;"then you're talking about,"
01:01:45;01:01:48;"you have to have the best of the best"
01:01:48;01:01:52;"with the lowest mileage, perfect condition deal"
01:01:52;01:01:53;"for it to be collectible."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"But they're out there, right?"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"But it's never gonna happen with like Toyotas"
01:01:57;01:02:00;"and Hondas, Celicas, things like that."
01:02:00;01:02:05;"Honda Accords, those are just cars that we buy to use"
01:02:05;01:02:08;"to get on with life and they get stolen a lot."
01:02:08;01:02:11;"- Right, there's never been like a surprise comeback"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"in the car community, the way that somebody's like,"
01:02:13;01:02:14;"are you kidding me?"
01:02:14;01:02:16;"All those comic books,"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"I threw out all my kids' comic books from the '60s."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"Now you're telling me this is worth,"
01:02:20;01:02:21;"well, who would have thought that cost a nickel?"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"There's no car version of that?"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"- No, there is. - Like a Mazda Miata?"
01:02:25;01:02:29;"- A Miata's have a pretty healthy, they're raced a lot."
01:02:29;01:02:30;"And so people make fun of them,"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"but they're the most raced car in the world."
01:02:32;01:02:35;"So for instance, my 12 year old right now is like,"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"dad, we have to get a '94 Miata."
01:02:37;01:02:40;"So I can hot rod it, maybe we can race it."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"I'm like, yeah, okay, I'll go right upstairs after this"
01:02:43;01:02:44;"and try to find you one."

01:03:54;01:03:56;"- What's your take on the PT Cruiser?"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"(laughing)"
01:03:58;01:03:59;"- It's a good comedy car."
01:03:59;01:04:01;"- I always thought it was funny because the Volkswagen,"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"they had the new Beetle."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"And then I felt like Chrysler,"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"I think Chrysler makes the PT Cruiser."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"They decided we're going to take the 1920s"
01:04:09;01:04:14;"sort of Model T style and smooth it out for the '90s."
01:04:14;01:04:15;"Am I way off on that?"
01:04:15;01:04:18;"- If you were an overweight family of five in Iowa"
01:04:18;01:04:21;"that was looking for something to drive to the buffet in,"
01:04:21;01:04:25;"I would say the PT Cruiser is for you."
01:04:25;01:04:28;"It is a very, it's a much maligned vehicle,"
01:04:28;01:04:31;"almost as maligned as the Prius,"
01:04:31;01:04:32;"which I think is unfairly maligned."
01:04:32;01:04:35;"It's a comedy vehicle for sure, like the PT Cruiser."
01:04:35;01:04:37;"That's, if you're going to use it in comedy,"
01:04:37;01:04:38;"I would say use the PT Cruiser."
01:04:38;01:04:42;"- We've talked on this show about how Grateful Dead T-shirts"
01:04:42;01:04:47;"probably one of the most produced band shirts ever"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"because they played such big shows or whatever,"
01:04:49;01:04:54;"that suddenly the value for real vintage Grateful Dead shirts"
01:04:54;01:04:57;"skyrocketed because of renewed interest in the band."
01:04:57;01:04:59;"And I'm sure you had all sorts of people being like,"
01:04:59;01:05:01;"""Oh my God, I had this smelly old shirt."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"You're telling me now I can sell it for $350."""
01:05:03;01:05:05;"I threw that out because at the time,"
01:05:05;01:05:09;"as far as shirts went, this held negligible value."
01:05:09;01:05:13;"So with the PT Cruiser, you just can't see."
01:05:13;01:05:16;"There's no version where in 30 years,"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"somebody's like, ""You know, it's funny."""
01:05:18;01:05:21;"Like back in the day, everybody was talking about,"
01:05:21;01:05:24;"you know, Porsches and Ferraris."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"And they're all talking about European cars."
01:05:25;01:05:28;"But actually the taste of the car community"
01:05:28;01:05:31;"has really come around and a PT Cruiser, you know,"
01:05:31;01:05:36;"if you had bought 10 PT Cruisers in good shape in 2020,"
01:05:36;01:05:37;"right now you would be a billionaire."
01:05:37;01:05:42;"There's no world where what you just said will ever happen."
01:05:42;01:05:46;"I don't think anybody's ever floated that theory before"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"with PT Cruisers."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"No, it's the car. Here are the cars."
01:05:50;01:05:53;"There's the cars where they only made 20 of them."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"The first part of it, you do have right."
01:05:55;01:05:58;"That so many people in the past have had these cars"
01:05:58;01:06:01;"and have owned them for years and let them go."
01:06:01;01:06:03;"And then they suddenly just pop out of nowhere."
01:06:03;01:06:06;"Race cars from the '60s and '70s"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"are a really good example of that."
01:06:08;01:06:09;"Because they were raced a lot,"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"they had different engines thrown in them."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"Because they were raced a lot, they were crashed."
01:06:13;01:06:16;"So right up until as recently as the '90s,"
01:06:16;01:06:19;"there was no market for used race cars."
01:06:19;01:06:21;"And then, you know, people were like,"
01:06:21;01:06:25;"""Well, hey, that's Steve McQueen's race car from Le Mans,"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"and it's got a camera mount still on it."
01:06:27;01:06:29;"That's a pretty cool thing, maybe."""
01:06:29;01:06:33;"And suddenly these people started buying these race cars"
01:06:33;01:06:35;"that had been passed around for next to nothing."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"And now they're worth, you know,"
01:06:37;01:06:41;"like that Steve McQueen 917 is a $30 million car."
01:06:41;01:06:45;"Whereas, you know, maybe in the '80s and '90s,"
01:06:45;01:06:48;"you might be getting that for nine or ten grand, right?"
01:06:48;01:06:49;"Right. Oh, my God."
01:06:49;01:06:50;"So there's stuff."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"The market does change,"
01:06:51;01:06:54;"but it always tends to go towards"
01:06:54;01:06:58;"the low-number rare vehicles."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"Was there ever like a limited edition,"
01:07:00;01:07:02;"like Eddie Bauer edition PT Cruiser type thing"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"that had a low..."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"[laughter]"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"You're going to keep going now."
01:07:08;01:07:11;"Okay, we can try the PT Cruiser thing."
01:07:11;01:07:12;"Do you?"
01:07:12;01:07:15;"[laughter]"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"Did you corner the market in PT Cruisers?"
01:07:17;01:07:18;"Do you need me?"
01:07:18;01:07:19;"I'll change what I have to say."
01:07:19;01:07:21;"I suck my legs for collecting PT Cruisers."
01:07:21;01:07:22;"I really thought this conversation"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"was going to go a different way."
01:07:24;01:07:26;"One actual question I have, though."
01:07:26;01:07:29;"I'm interested in like what holds value and stuff."
01:07:29;01:07:31;"And I know a lot of people are into Porsches,"
01:07:31;01:07:34;"and objectively, it's a beautiful car."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"And yeah, when I've hung out with my friend"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"as a 1969 911,"
01:07:38;01:07:39;"and I'm like, I get it."
01:07:39;01:07:40;"Like we're driving around,"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"and also like the conversations people strike up."
01:07:42;01:07:45;"I'm like, oh, this is kind of like a cool community."
01:07:45;01:07:46;"Just like at Dunkin' Donuts,"
01:07:46;01:07:47;"there's always like somebody's like,"
01:07:47;01:07:48;"oh, what year is that?"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"And I'm like, okay, this is like a secret society"
01:07:50;01:07:52;"that you guys are a part of."
01:07:52;01:07:54;"But one question that I have is,"
01:07:54;01:07:56;"does the focus of the community"
01:07:56;01:07:59;"still stay pretty like zoomed in"
01:07:59;01:08:01;"on like the 50s through the 70s?"
01:08:01;01:08:03;"Or is like now that we're 20 years out"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"from the year 2000,"
01:08:05;01:08:06;"are they starting to be like,"
01:08:06;01:08:09;"you know, a 2003 911,"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"like that's actually skyrocketing value?"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"Or does everybody still kind of keep focusing"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"similar to, you know,"
01:08:15;01:08:18;"Rolling Stone just dropped their top 500 albums"
01:08:18;01:08:19;"of all time."
01:08:19;01:08:21;"The highest percentage was the 70s."
01:08:21;01:08:22;"Even though, you know,"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"now we're 50 years out from the 70s."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"There's, you know, like in music,"
01:08:26;01:08:29;"there's still is a disproportionately"
01:08:29;01:08:31;"huge focus on the 60s and 70s."
01:08:31;01:08:33;"Is there a similar thing with the car community?"
01:08:33;01:08:36;"- Yeah, but getting back to the PT Cruiser."
01:08:36;01:08:37;"- Yes."
01:08:37;01:08:38;"- In 2006,"
01:08:38;01:08:41;"they announced that they had made a million,"
01:08:41;01:08:43;"a million, think of this."
01:08:43;01:08:44;"There are a million PT Cruisers"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"out there in the world right now."
01:08:46;01:08:48;"All right, which means any one of us this evening"
01:08:48;01:08:51;"can probably go get one for a few hundred dollars"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"because there are a million of them out there."
01:08:53;01:08:54;"- What about if you could get one"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"in truly mint condition?"
01:08:56;01:08:58;"That this has zero miles on it?"
01:08:58;01:08:59;"- Yeah, but it doesn't matter."
01:08:59;01:09:01;"- That wouldn't matter to a collector?"
01:09:01;01:09:02;"That wouldn't matter to you?"
01:09:02;01:09:03;"If I told you right now,"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"I had it at $1598. - Yes, it would."
01:09:05;01:09:06;"- It had zero miles on it."
01:09:06;01:09:09;"- Yeah, but you're talking about a premium of what?"
01:09:09;01:09:11;"Maybe 10% above what they're worth?"
01:09:11;01:09:12;"So yeah, okay, instead of 700,"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"I'm going to give you 1,200 for it."
01:09:14;01:09:16;"It just doesn't have value"
01:09:16;01:09:17;"because there's no market for it."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"But getting back to your question,"
01:09:18;01:09:21;"after that, there are a couple of things"
01:09:21;01:09:22;"that I've noticed."
01:09:22;01:09:23;"These are just my observations."
01:09:23;01:09:26;"One, when you were in high school,"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"the car that you may have had on your wall"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"or the wallpaper on your computer"
01:09:30;01:09:31;"is generally the one that later on,"
01:09:31;01:09:34;"when you're successful in your 30s and you have money,"
01:09:34;01:09:35;"that's the car you buy."
01:09:35;01:09:39;"So right now, it was 60s and 70s cars,"
01:09:39;01:09:43;"but I'm noticing lots of 80s cars and 90s cars"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"are doing really well in the market"
01:09:45;01:09:48;"because that group of guys and girls"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"now have a little money to spend."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"Maybe they're settled in their family"
01:09:51;01:09:53;"and they want something cool."
01:09:53;01:09:55;"And it's the thing they looked at"
01:09:55;01:09:56;"when they were 12 on the road"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"that they go, ""Oh, now I want to have that."""
01:09:58;01:10:00;"And then there's, you know,"
01:10:00;01:10:03;"you see these old Bentleys and things,"
01:10:03;01:10:06;"the Rolls Royces that, I don't know,"
01:10:06;01:10:07;"they never really appealed to me,"
01:10:07;01:10:09;"but I find as I'm getting older,"
01:10:09;01:10:11;"I really liked brand new cars"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"and then suddenly I was looking at the 80s"
01:10:13;01:10:15;"and then suddenly the 70s and the 60s"
01:10:15;01:10:18;"and now I'm really interested in the 50s."
01:10:18;01:10:19;"I keep suddenly going back."
01:10:19;01:10:21;"- Ah, you go further and further."
01:10:21;01:10:25;"- Yeah, and smaller and smaller and more mechanical."
01:10:25;01:10:27;"No computers, no power, anything."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"I really like that experience"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"more than anything else right now."
01:10:30;01:10:32;"So that also, I've noticed,"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"happens with Friends of Mine."
01:10:34;01:10:35;"- Is there a thing like with watches"
01:10:35;01:10:37;"where people want to get something"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"from the year they were born?"
01:10:39;01:10:42;"- Yes, that's very big in the car world"
01:10:42;01:10:43;"and the watch world."
01:10:43;01:10:44;"It doesn't work."
01:10:44;01:10:45;"It doesn't do anything."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"It will not enhance your enjoyment."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"It's a trap that we get."
01:10:49;01:10:51;"We think I've done it"
01:10:51;01:10:55;"and I have a car right now that is '82"
01:10:55;01:10:56;"that I didn't buy"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"because it's the year I graduated high school,"
01:10:58;01:11:01;"but when it was offered to me,"
01:11:01;01:11:02;"I went, ""Oh, absolutely."
01:11:02;01:11:04;"""I've got to get it for that reason."""
01:11:04;01:11:08;"It does not figure into my driving pleasure in any way."
01:11:08;01:11:12;"It's the car, the preservation example,"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"the way it drives is all that matters."
01:11:14;01:11:16;"It's a very funny little trap"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"and it's a very funny question."
01:11:18;01:11:19;"It does not work."
01:11:19;01:11:22;"Here's what does work in the watch community."
01:11:22;01:11:23;"I just find with people,"
01:11:23;01:11:27;"buying something to commemorate a moment in your life"
01:11:27;01:11:30;"or giving a gift to someone you care about"
01:11:30;01:11:32;"in a big moment in their life,"
01:11:32;01:11:36;"that I find enriches the ownership experience."
01:11:36;01:11:38;"Your son's graduating high school"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"and you give him something he can appreciate."
01:11:40;01:11:43;"He will remember that when he looks at that watch."
01:11:43;01:11:44;"- You mean give him a watch"
01:11:44;01:11:45;"from the year he was born"
01:11:45;01:11:48;"or just give him a watch for a new watch or whatever,"
01:11:48;01:11:49;"just that it commemorates that moment."
01:11:49;01:11:52;"- My personal experience with my watch collection"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"is the stuff in my collection,"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"I can look at it and tell you exactly what was going on"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"and why I have that watch."
01:11:58;01:12:02;"It was never just like, ""Oh, I want a shiny thing."""
01:12:02;01:12:06;"It was like, ""Here's the first year of Seinfeld"
01:12:06;01:12:10;"""and I want to commemorate not getting fired."""
01:12:10;01:12:13;"So I bought that Tag Heuer watch."
01:12:13;01:12:15;"And I remember it when I wear it."
01:12:15;01:12:18;"I'm like, ""Oh, I know what that watch means."""
01:12:18;01:12:21;"That's a good thing to do."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"- It seems like cars and watches,"
01:12:22;01:12:25;"there's a huge overlap in terms of interest."
01:12:25;01:12:28;"I can imagine for a variety of reasons,"
01:12:28;01:12:31;"you can get into the technical side if you wanted to,"
01:12:31;01:12:35;"the mechanics, just the design element, the history."
01:12:35;01:12:37;"It makes sense that people would be interested"
01:12:37;01:12:38;"in both of them."
01:12:38;01:12:40;"Do you find that it's like almost everybody"
01:12:40;01:12:42;"who's into one is into the other"
01:12:42;01:12:46;"or do you ever find, ""I'm a watch guy"
01:12:46;01:12:49;"""and I look down on car guys,"" or vice versa?"
01:12:49;01:12:50;"- That's hilarious."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"No, watch guys and car guys,"
01:12:52;01:12:55;"they're very closely related in their stupidity"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"and their addiction to these things."
01:12:57;01:12:59;"Very closely related."
01:12:59;01:13:02;"- Once somebody told me that they were like"
01:13:02;01:13:05;"a classic path for a guy, gets into cars"
01:13:05;01:13:07;"and then gets into watches"
01:13:07;01:13:10;"and then finally gets into guns."
01:13:10;01:13:12;"And I was like, ""Whoa, really?"""
01:13:12;01:13:15;"And he's like, ""Yeah, but you know."""
01:13:15;01:13:16;"- Not in some creepy way,"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"they're just in that sense of being interested"
01:13:18;01:13:21;"in the mechanics of objects and the history"
01:13:21;01:13:22;"and the collectible nature."
01:13:22;01:13:24;"Is that true?"
01:13:24;01:13:25;"- No, I don't see that."
01:13:25;01:13:26;"- No."
01:13:26;01:13:27;"(laughing)"
01:13:27;01:13:30;"- I see cars, there's kind of an Esquire,"
01:13:30;01:13:34;"kind of a European James Bond-y gentleman"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"kind of aspect to it."
01:13:36;01:13:39;"I'll tell you what, cigars, I would put in that category."
01:13:39;01:13:40;"- Right."
01:13:40;01:13:44;"- Bourbons, specific alcohols,"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"they're all kind of in that world."
01:13:46;01:13:48;"- And maybe guitars, if you like music."
01:13:48;01:13:49;"- Oh, definitely."
01:13:49;01:13:52;"I mean, I try and I've just broken my own rule,"
01:13:52;01:13:56;"but I try to avoid guitars and motorcycles"
01:13:56;01:13:57;"'cause I'll go down a similar road"
01:13:57;01:13:59;"and suddenly I'll end up having 10 guitars."
01:13:59;01:14:02;"Now, I'm saying that to you as I now have five guitars"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"in my house all of a sudden"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"'cause my 10-year-old just started taking lessons"
01:14:06;01:14:09;"and that started me up playing again"
01:14:09;01:14:10;"and then I called up Taylor and I said,"
01:14:10;01:14:14;"""Hey, send me one of those 717E Builder Editions acoustics."
01:14:14;01:14:16;"""I want a real acoustic guitar."""
01:14:16;01:14:18;"'Cause I've been playing my same guitar"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"I've been playing since I was 12 years old,"
01:14:20;01:14:25;"which was a Lark that I think my parents paid $28 for."
01:14:25;01:14:28;"So I went from that old guitar to this one."
01:14:28;01:14:29;"I'm like, ""Oh my God, this is great."""
01:14:29;01:14:30;"And they go, ""You know what?"
01:14:30;01:14:31;"""Let's go get the Telecasters"
01:14:31;01:14:33;"""and the Stratocasters out of storage."""
01:14:33;01:14:37;"And so now every room just got guitars and stands on it"
01:14:37;01:14:38;"and I've lost my mind."
01:14:38;01:14:41;"I have to stop myself from asking you, ""What's next?"""
01:14:41;01:14:43;"What do I get next?"
01:14:43;01:14:44;"- Art."
01:14:44;01:14:45;"- What is it?"
01:14:45;01:14:46;"- Oh, art."
01:14:46;01:14:48;"- No, I mean, what kind of guitar?"
01:14:48;01:14:49;"- No, do you collect?"
01:14:49;01:14:51;"No, I mean, what's next is collecting art."
01:14:51;01:14:53;"- Yeah, no, that's it."
01:14:53;01:14:54;"- Oh, that's nice to know."
01:14:54;01:14:56;"- No, and also, clearly I have a contrarian streak."
01:14:56;01:15:00;"I like PT Cruisers and for guitars,"
01:15:00;01:15:03;"probably like the guitar, I own very few guitars."
01:15:03;01:15:06;"I mean, you know, like I played an Epiphone Sheridan"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"on stage a lot, I like Strats,"
01:15:08;01:15:12;"but I really love Silvertones and that was a cheap guitar."
01:15:12;01:15:15;"But I really think that the Silvertones made by Sears,"
01:15:15;01:15:18;"Silvertone amps, Silvertone guitars from the late '60s."
01:15:18;01:15:19;"- That's cool."
01:15:19;01:15:21;"- I like how they look and I like how they sound,"
01:15:21;01:15:23;"but yeah, but guitars are,"
01:15:23;01:15:25;"yeah, it is kind of different than cars."
01:15:25;01:15:27;"The experience of playing a guitar,"
01:15:27;01:15:30;"it can be so idiosyncratic versus like driving a car"
01:15:30;01:15:33;"where your life is in the hands of the machine."
01:15:33;01:15:36;"You want something that's like really technically well-built."
01:15:36;01:15:37;"Sometimes with the guitar,"
01:15:37;01:15:39;"you want something (beep) up and weird sounding."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"I don't know if that's true with cars."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"- This is exactly, your guitars are exactly the same."
01:15:43;01:15:45;"It's what I call crow behavior."
01:15:45;01:15:47;"You know how the crow sees the shiny thing"
01:15:47;01:15:50;"and every day it brings the shiny thing back to the nest?"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"That's what collecting is, really."
01:15:52;01:15:55;"You know, you get the thing, you enjoy it,"
01:15:55;01:15:57;"the novelty wears off and you're like,"
01:15:57;01:15:58;"""Where's the next one?"""
01:15:58;01:16:00;"And you know, I could do that with guitars."
01:16:00;01:16:02;"I could do it with motorcycles."
01:16:02;01:16:03;"I've done it with cars."
01:16:03;01:16:06;"Watches is way out of control for people."
01:16:06;01:16:08;"You should see what people are doing with watches."
01:16:08;01:16:11;"They're just acquiring and you know, you really have to,"
01:16:11;01:16:15;"and this is really where Spikes Car Radio is at its best."
01:16:15;01:16:19;"It's discussing this thing we do"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"and the ups and downs of it"
01:16:21;01:16:22;"and the traps and everything else."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"That's what we really, you know,"
01:16:24;01:16:27;"Gary comes on and I'm with Paul, my co-host."
01:16:27;01:16:31;"We like to talk about situations like the lose-win,"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"when you're overheated about a car"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"and you don't win the bid"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"and the relief you feel"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"and the loss you feel at the same time."
01:16:39;01:16:41;"Like, ""Oh, I lost that thing I really wanted,"
01:16:41;01:16:45;"but it's a win because I didn't spend the money."""
01:16:45;01:16:46;"And then three days later, you're like,"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"""Why was I even thinking about that?"""
01:16:48;01:16:49;"Right?"
01:16:49;01:16:51;"Or we have this thing called Carnesia"
01:16:51;01:16:53;"where you get into a car"
01:16:53;01:16:56;"you haven't driven for six months"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"and you're like, ""Oh my God, this thing is great."
01:16:58;01:17:00;"Why have I not been driving this?"""
01:17:00;01:17:01;"Right?"
01:17:01;01:17:04;"That's, you know, the fun of collecting"
01:17:04;01:17:07;"is the psychology and the weirdness of it."
01:17:07;01:17:09;"And I think guitars are exactly the same."
01:17:09;01:17:10;"Everything you just said about your guitars"
01:17:10;01:17:11;"and the reasons why you love them"
01:17:11;01:17:13;"is exactly what I've heard"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"with people talking about their cars,"
01:17:15;01:17:16;"whatever they might be."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"Spike, I don't want to interrupt the flow here,"
01:17:18;01:17:21;"but can I ask a question that's off topic a little bit?"
01:17:21;01:17:23;"As long as it's about Jeffrey Toobin."
01:17:23;01:17:25;"It's..."
01:17:25;01:17:29;"I mean, unless he has a cameo for the B-movie sequel,"
01:17:29;01:17:31;"I just wanted to know what's happening with the..."
01:17:31;01:17:32;"That's funny."
01:17:32;01:17:33;"What's happening with the B-quel?"
01:17:33;01:17:34;"The B-quel?"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"Did you think there was a B-quel?"
01:17:36;01:17:39;"Well, I know that Jerry tweeted, you know,"
01:17:39;01:17:42;"a bit of like a teasing thing a couple of years ago,"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"""Should I do a B-movie too?"""
01:17:44;01:17:45;"And people got very excited"
01:17:45;01:17:49;"because the B-movie has taken on a new cultural significance."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"Can you tell me what that is?"
01:17:51;01:17:55;"Because we're just not understanding it."
01:17:55;01:17:57;"I think it's reached a new generation."
01:17:57;01:17:59;"Maybe there's some nostalgia built in."
01:17:59;01:18:01;"It's been filtered through the prism of the internet."
01:18:01;01:18:02;"I just want to know,"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"has there ever been any earnest conversation"
01:18:04;01:18:07;"about actually following up that film?"
01:18:07;01:18:11;"There has, but it's mostly been fun and joking around."
01:18:11;01:18:14;"So in 2016, I think, is the year you're talking about."
01:18:14;01:18:16;"And if I'm wrong, forgive me."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"But in 2016, I believe, for some reason,"
01:18:18;01:18:21;"B-movie, which came out in 2006,"
01:18:21;01:18:25;"in 2016, B-movie was the biggest movie on social media."
01:18:25;01:18:27;"And it was because kids and teenagers"
01:18:27;01:18:30;"were putting the entire script on their social media,"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"on T-shirts, and, you know,"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"we're just sitting here watching this thing going,"
01:18:34;01:18:37;"""Are they making fun of us? Do they love it?"""
01:18:37;01:18:39;"We still don't understand what it was"
01:18:39;01:18:42;"and why it was happening."
01:18:42;01:18:43;"But I said to Jerry, I go,"
01:18:43;01:18:45;"""Look, let's just have some fun with it."""
01:18:45;01:18:47;"He go, ""Are we going to do one?"""
01:18:47;01:18:48;"I go, ""No, we're not going to do one."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"We already did it. We did one."""
01:18:50;01:18:52;"He goes, ""I don't want to go through that again."""
01:18:52;01:18:54;"And I said, ""All right, here's what I want you to do."
01:18:54;01:18:56;"I'm going to have a B-movie 2 script printed up,"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"just something that says 'B-movie 2,"
01:18:58;01:19:01;"do not distribute some stuff on it."
01:19:01;01:19:03;"I just want to arrange for you to come out of your apartment building,"
01:19:03;01:19:05;"and I'll have a paparazzi there,"
01:19:05;01:19:08;"and just kind of incidentally shoot the script in your head."""
01:19:08;01:19:09;"Oh, my God."
01:19:09;01:19:11;"So it'll be small, but people will be able to see it,"
01:19:11;01:19:13;"and they'll go, ""Geez, that's this B-movie 2."
01:19:13;01:19:14;"They are doing it."""
01:19:14;01:19:19;"We've talked about lots of like pranky things like that very seriously,"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"as recently as yesterday,"
01:19:21;01:19:25;"as I was doing an interview with a Yahoo Entertainment reporter two days ago,"
01:19:25;01:19:28;"and he asked the same exact question."
01:19:28;01:19:31;"""Do you ever talk to the B-movie writers about doing something?"""
01:19:31;01:19:33;"And we did talk about briefly--"
01:19:33;01:19:36;"and again, this is just like you and us talking right here."
01:19:36;01:19:38;"We did get together and just chat about the idea"
01:19:38;01:19:43;"of some sort of eight-episode arc on a Netflix or something like that,"
01:19:43;01:19:49;"and just had a lot more fun with some of the ideas that we generated that we didn't do."
01:19:49;01:19:53;"But again, it was just talk, just fun, right?"
01:19:53;01:19:59;"We were not, and I don't believe, are seriously pursuing it."
01:19:59;01:20:01;"The fact that it comes up so often, you know."
01:20:01;01:20:05;"Here's the reason we want to do it, so we can write Jeff Bezos."
01:20:05;01:20:07;"[laughter]"
01:20:07;01:20:11;"We were dying to have a character Jeff Bezos."
01:20:11;01:20:14;"If that continues to entertain us, maybe."
01:20:14;01:20:17;"But I don't know, is DreamWorks Animation still even in business?"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"Nobody even knows who owns it."
01:20:19;01:20:21;"We don't even know how to even approach anything like this."
01:20:21;01:20:23;"Go straight to Amazon."
01:20:23;01:20:24;"That's right."
01:20:24;01:20:26;"Who owns the rights to B-movie?"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"Oh, who owns the rights to B-movie?"
01:20:28;01:20:29;"Who owns them?"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"Is DreamWorks Animation still in business?"
01:20:31;01:20:32;"It's a mess."
01:20:32;01:20:34;"[laughter]"
01:20:34;01:20:36;"All right, we'll do some research and get--"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"We'll try to make this happen. Why not?"
01:20:38;01:20:41;"Come back to me with your thoughts, and we'll talk."
01:20:41;01:20:44;"Well, thanks so much, Spike. We hope you'll come back again."
01:20:44;01:20:45;"We covered a lot of ground."
01:20:45;01:20:48;"And I don't know, it sounds like for your podcast,"
01:20:48;01:20:51;"you probably wouldn't do a PT Cruiser episode."
01:20:51;01:20:54;"But if you-- I don't know if you're already into it, but--"
01:20:54;01:20:55;"[laughter]"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"If you do, we'd be happy."
01:20:57;01:21:00;"And we'll really research, and we'll come correct."
01:21:00;01:21:02;"Yeah, that would be good."
01:21:02;01:21:04;"No, I would be happy to do that."
01:21:04;01:21:08;"The show is mostly the intersection of entertainment and cars."
01:21:08;01:21:12;"And sometimes it's just comedians coming on and promoting their specials."
01:21:12;01:21:16;"And we're out there every Wednesday with a new show."
01:21:16;01:21:19;"We had Jerry on last week, and this fella who's got a new book,"
01:21:19;01:21:22;"A Man and His Cars, on today's show."
01:21:22;01:21:25;"But we've had Jason Bateman, Matt Damon come on,"
01:21:25;01:21:28;"lots of big stars, and then lots of folks you don't know"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"who we just think are great."
01:21:30;01:21:32;"Well, everybody check it out."
01:21:32;01:21:35;"And even though the Esquire network's been canceled,"
01:21:35;01:21:40;"check out the pre-season car matchmaker, which you can still stream."
01:21:40;01:21:42;"Yeah, it's still there."
01:21:42;01:21:45;"Well, great talking to you, Spike. Thanks so much for coming on."
01:21:45;01:21:46;"Very nice to meet you guys."
01:21:46;01:21:48;"Yeah, nice to meet you too. Have a good one."
01:21:48;01:21:50;"All right, take care now."
01:21:50;01:21:51;"Let's get into the top five."
01:21:52;01:21:58;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:21:58;01:22:01;"This week on the top five, we're going to be comparing"
01:22:01;01:22:04;"the top five songs on Apple Music right now"
01:22:04;01:22:08;"with the top five Billboard hits of 1995."
01:22:08;01:22:10;"Why 1995, Jake?"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"I was hoping Seinfeld could jump in here."
01:22:12;01:22:14;"Oh, yeah, Seinfeld. Maybe this one's better for you."
01:22:14;01:22:18;"Wasn't this the year that the Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld debuted?"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"Yes, and actually very close to--"
01:22:20;01:22:22;"it's almost exactly 25 years ago."
01:22:22;01:22:26;"That was November 2, 1995."
01:22:26;01:22:30;"You know what's also wild is I graduated high school in '95."
01:22:30;01:22:33;"Was there a big Seinfeld head at that era, Jake?"
01:22:33;01:22:36;"I wouldn't say it was a head. I was definitely a fan."
01:22:36;01:22:39;"But I still have not seen every episode."
01:22:39;01:22:42;"What the f***?"
01:22:42;01:22:44;"Is there going to be a problem?"
01:22:44;01:22:45;"No, I mean, it's cool."
01:22:45;01:22:46;"Is there going to be a problem?"
01:22:46;01:22:49;"No, I mean, it's all on DVD. It's coming to Netflix next year."
01:22:49;01:22:53;"Seinfeld just cannot control himself."
01:22:53;01:22:58;"I would watch Seinfeld episodes on rerun after Yankees games."
01:22:58;01:23:01;"WPIX at like 11."
01:23:01;01:23:06;"I wouldn't watch when they were airing Thursdays at 8 or whatever."
01:23:06;01:23:09;"I saw most of them in the late night ones."
01:23:09;01:23:14;"I almost envy you because you still have unseen episodes."
01:23:14;01:23:16;"I wish I was in that position."
01:23:16;01:23:17;"I mean, definitely a fan."
01:23:17;01:23:24;"It definitely was the only sitcom that I thought had any sort of voice or vision or anything."
01:23:24;01:23:26;"It changed the game."
01:23:26;01:23:27;"It changed the game, exactly."
01:23:27;01:23:30;"Influential television program."
01:23:30;01:23:34;"The number five song, Michael Jackson, ""You Are Not Alone."""
01:23:34;01:23:40;"I remember this song well."
01:23:40;01:23:43;"I can't believe 1995 was 25 years ago."
01:23:43;01:23:45;"I know."
01:23:45;01:23:48;"You know what? I was 25 years ago in October."
01:23:48;01:23:50;"I saw Fish."
01:23:50;01:23:51;"Oh, really?"
01:23:51;01:23:54;"At the Rose Garden in Portland, Oregon."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"Fall of my freshman year."
01:23:56;01:23:57;"Oh, this is a good song."
01:23:57;01:23:59;"Yeah, this is a classic."
01:23:59;01:24:04;"This song is produced by R. Kelly and written by R. Kelly and Michael Jackson."
01:24:04;01:24:07;"So you saw it 25 years ago."
01:24:07;01:24:09;"Yeah, I went to a Fish show 25 years ago."
01:24:09;01:24:11;"It's the only Fish show I've ever seen."
01:24:11;01:24:20;"And I went with my mom's college friend who was a college professor in Portland at a different school than I went to."
01:24:20;01:24:25;"It was like she and her daughter, who were a few years older than me, they were like huge fish heads."
01:24:25;01:24:27;"Wait, was it at the Memorial Coliseum?"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"Oh, maybe that's where it was."
01:24:29;01:24:30;"I thought it was the Rose Garden."
01:24:30;01:24:31;"Wherever."
01:24:31;01:24:36;"Do you think it was Thursday, October 5th?"
01:24:36;01:24:37;"Yeah, that sounds about right."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"I mean, definitely October."
01:24:39;01:24:40;"I'm looking at the set list."
01:24:40;01:24:42;"Shock, dust, torture opener."
01:24:42;01:24:44;"A lot of classic stuff."
01:24:44;01:24:47;"I do remember they played ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps."""
01:24:47;01:24:49;"Yes, that was the encore."
01:24:49;01:24:50;"They closed it out."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"I remember that."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"You stayed through the whole show."
01:24:52;01:25:02;"Yeah, and my mom's college friend and her daughter were like, they're like classic Portland hippies, like '90s Portland hippies with tie-dye dresses."
01:25:02;01:25:03;"They were just like twirling."
01:25:03;01:25:05;"I was a little more uptight then."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"Were they people passing you joints?"
01:25:07;01:25:08;"Probably."
01:25:08;01:25:09;"I don't think I partook."
01:25:09;01:25:13;"But I remember, here's the thing."
01:25:13;01:25:15;"I remember I loved the dead."
01:25:15;01:25:21;"And I remember, of course, and I remember asking Martha, my mom's friend, like, yeah, this is cool."
01:25:21;01:25:22;"Do you like the dead?"
01:25:22;01:25:25;"She's like, oh, man, the dead were political, man."
01:25:25;01:25:30;"She's like, I didn't like the dead back in the '60s."
01:25:30;01:25:31;"The dead were political."
01:25:31;01:25:32;"Interesting."
01:25:32;01:25:33;"And I was like, what do you mean?"
01:25:33;01:25:36;"She's like, no, the stones were political, man."
01:25:36;01:25:37;"Let it flee."
01:25:37;01:25:40;"Jerry was famously kind of like, listen, do your own thing."
01:25:40;01:25:42;"We're not here to judge."
01:25:42;01:25:43;"Yeah."
01:25:43;01:25:49;"I love that we've just had like a three-minute conversation about Jake's first and only fish show just over."
01:25:49;01:25:51;"You are not alone."
01:25:51;01:25:53;"That is a good song, by the way."
01:25:53;01:25:54;"It is a good song."
01:25:54;01:25:58;"When you find out R. Kelly wrote it, it makes a lot of sense."
01:25:58;01:25:59;"It sounds like an R. Kelly song."
01:25:59;01:26:04;"But I'm speaking as somebody who's-- I've seen one fish show and one Tray Anastasio band show."
01:26:04;01:26:11;"But I think next time, when COVID's over and people are back on the road, we should all go to a fish show together."
01:26:11;01:26:12;"It's a very fun show."
01:26:12;01:26:13;"Oh, yeah."
01:26:13;01:26:14;"No, dude, we roll."
01:26:14;01:26:16;"We get the Richard Pictures guys to go."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"Oh, yeah."
01:26:17;01:26:18;"We get the Vampire guys to go."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"We get CT in the mix."
01:26:19;01:26:20;"Oh, yeah."
01:26:20;01:26:21;"That's a fun night."
01:26:21;01:26:22;"Let's roll deep."
01:26:22;01:26:23;"We're at a party bus."
01:26:23;01:26:24;"I'm in."
01:26:24;01:26:25;"Oh, hell yeah, dude."
01:26:25;01:26:27;"Apple's paying for it, right?"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"Apple will not pay."
01:26:29;01:26:33;"Like, legally speaking, Apple cannot pay for shrooms in the lot."
01:26:33;01:26:37;"However, Apple can purchase you items to trade."
01:26:37;01:26:42;"And if you choose to trade them for shrooms in the lot, that's technically your call."
01:26:42;01:26:45;"The number five song right now is called ""Mr. Right Now."""
01:26:45;01:26:47;"Whoa."
01:26:47;01:26:48;"Trippy."
01:26:48;01:26:52;"It's 21 Savage and Metro Boomin, ""Mr. Right Now"" featuring Drake."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"Let's check it out."

01:26:54;01:26:55;"Whoa."
01:26:55;01:26:56;"This is, like, beautiful."
01:26:56;01:26:57;"I actually haven't heard this."
01:26:57;01:27:06;"I've heard about this mixtape because I know Morgan Freeman narrates the mixtape."
01:27:06;01:27:07;"Oh, really?"
01:27:07;01:27:08;"Yeah."

01:27:21;01:27:27;"I love 21 Savage."
01:27:27;01:27:36;"He really is, like, one of my favorite current popular rappers."
01:27:36;01:27:38;"I just love his delivery."

01:27:40;01:27:49;"What did he say about quarantine?"
01:27:49;01:27:53;"This might be the first song on the top five we've heard that directly references quarantine."
01:27:53;01:27:56;"We're in quarantine."
01:27:56;01:27:57;"On God."
01:27:57;01:27:58;"But my Ms are long."
01:27:58;01:27:59;"On God."
01:27:59;01:28:00;"What does he mean by Ms?"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"Money?"
01:28:01;01:28:02;"Millions?"
01:28:02;01:28:06;"When this song was released, the world was in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic."
01:28:06;01:28:07;"Fascinating."
01:28:07;01:28:12;"Well, they're-- you know, I guess on Genius, they're creating it for posterity."
01:28:12;01:28:14;"They don't want to have to revise it."
01:28:14;01:28:18;"This negatively affected the financial situation of millions of Americans."
01:28:18;01:28:21;"Singers like Savage were forced to postpone or cancel their concerts."
01:28:21;01:28:26;"However, Savage indicates that these restrictions did not limit or stop his inflow of wealth."
01:28:26;01:28:31;"As of this song's release, Savage's net worth is approximated at over $12 million and still"
01:28:31;01:28:32;"growing."
01:28:32;01:28:33;"OK."
01:28:33;01:28:34;"I understand."
01:28:34;01:28:37;"He's saying it's a quarantine, but don't get it twisted."
01:28:37;01:28:38;"I'm still rich."
01:28:38;01:28:40;"Well, guess what, 21 Savage?"
01:28:40;01:28:45;"I read that this COVID pandemic created the greatest wealth transfer in history."
01:28:45;01:28:48;"So you're in good company with many other rich people."
01:28:48;01:28:49;"Nothing to be proud of."
01:28:49;01:28:50;"Whoa."
01:28:50;01:28:51;"Shots fired."
01:28:51;01:28:56;"Getting more rich during a pandemic is nothing to be proud of."
01:28:56;01:28:59;"I'm just going to throw that out there."
01:28:59;01:29:01;"He's a savvy investor."
01:29:01;01:29:05;"Look, that's just how Genius.com interpreted it."
01:29:05;01:29:10;"He could also be like-- maybe he's saying-- well, because the line before is, ""Got a pretty"
01:29:10;01:29:15;"girl that I'm feeling on. We in quarantine, but my M's long."""
01:29:15;01:29:20;"Maybe he's saying that he recently met a pretty girl and he wants to have her over to hang"
01:29:20;01:29:23;"out and we're in quarantine."
01:29:23;01:29:30;"But given his wealth, which he acquired before the pandemic, he can afford rapid testing."
01:29:30;01:29:36;"He could maybe even send a private jet so that this girl doesn't have to fly commercial"
01:29:36;01:29:37;"and be stressed out."
01:29:37;01:29:43;"What was the futuristic treatment that Trump had that made him miraculously bounce back?"
01:29:43;01:29:44;"Regeneron."
01:29:44;01:29:46;"He's flooded with Regeneron."
01:29:46;01:29:51;"Right, because Regeneron is one of the best treatments, but apparently from what I've"
01:29:51;01:29:55;"heard, it's never going to be available to most people because it's incredibly expensive"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"and difficult to make."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"Actually, that would rhyme."
01:29:58;01:29:59;"It's experimental."
01:29:59;01:30:04;"""Fridge full of Regeneron"" is a great line."
01:30:04;01:30:05;"That would even work here."
01:30:05;01:30:10;"""Got a pretty girl that I'm feeling on. We in quarantine, but I got Regeneron."""
01:30:10;01:30:15;"He has a second fridge full of Regeneron."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"The ultimate status symbol."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"It's actually a third fridge."
01:30:19;01:30:22;"""I got a third fridge full of Regeneron."""
01:30:22;01:30:27;"""I got a chest freezer full of Regeneron."""
01:30:27;01:30:30;"Regeneron is so RoboCop."
01:30:30;01:30:36;"Yes. It's like unobtainium, that avatar chemical."
01:30:36;01:30:39;"Wait, is it really called unobtainium?"
01:30:39;01:30:42;"Yes. The Regeneron Corporation."
01:30:42;01:30:45;"Yeah, it's just like a movie made in 1989."
01:30:45;01:30:51;"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 2011 Conference of Robotics."
01:30:51;01:30:54;"We are here to..."
01:30:54;01:30:57;"Ladies and gentlemen, the year is 2014."
01:30:57;01:31:00;"Thank you for coming to meet on the moon."
01:31:00;01:31:04;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:31:04;01:31:06;"It's always funny when you look back on those movies."
01:31:06;01:31:08;"It's never even that far in the future."
01:31:08;01:31:11;"They're always like, they're very sure of themselves just to be like,"
01:31:11;01:31:14;"""Yeah, 30 years, sure."""
01:31:14;01:31:17;"But I don't know if maybe a lot of people do,"
01:31:17;01:31:20;"but 21 Savage seems to talk about Ms a lot"
01:31:20;01:31:24;"because he had a great song called ""Bank Account."""
01:31:24;01:31:26;"It was a really big hit a few years ago."
01:31:26;01:31:31;"Where he went, ""I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight Ms in my bank account."""
01:31:31;01:31:36;"And then he goes, ""I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight shooters ready to gun you down."""
01:31:36;01:31:43;"Do we ever try to do a rap song that was about listing how many fridges you have?"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:31:45;01:31:47;"Maybe that's a better idea to throw out there and not even try to do it."
01:31:47;01:31:54;"But it's like, ""I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight fridges in my garage."""
01:31:54;01:31:56;"Fridges in my residence."
01:31:56;01:31:58;"In my residence."
01:31:58;01:32:00;"I got fridges in my residence."
01:32:00;01:32:04;"That could be a great verse, breaking down what you use every fridge for."
01:32:04;01:32:07;"Oh, yeah. And then it's like, ""Eight fridge household."""
01:32:07;01:32:08;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:32:08;01:32:10;"""Eight fridge household."""
01:32:10;01:32:13;"That kind of weirdly reminds me of, there's a Jay-Z lyric,"
01:32:13;01:32:16;"""Got a condo with nothing but condoms in it."""
01:32:16;01:32:18;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:32:18;01:32:19;"Do you remember that one?"
01:32:19;01:32:23;"I mean, he needs the storage."
01:32:23;01:32:25;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:32:25;01:32:26;"It's just bizarre."
01:32:26;01:32:29;"Also, maybe I'm picturing late period Jay-Z,"
01:32:29;01:32:32;"where the fact that he's an art collector,"
01:32:32;01:32:34;"everybody knows and he talked about it."
01:32:34;01:32:38;"But the idea of a condo filled with condoms,"
01:32:38;01:32:42;"it's like in the early '90s at the height of the AIDS epidemic,"
01:32:42;01:32:47;"the Whitney Museum had an artist in residence program,"
01:32:47;01:32:52;"and a conceptual artist, whoever, take your pick."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"Felix Gonzalez Torres."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"Is that a real person?"
01:32:55;01:32:56;"Yes."
01:32:56;01:32:57;"Does that kind of stuff."
01:32:57;01:33:00;"It's like in Felix Gonzalez Torres actually purchased a condo,"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"which the Whitney still maintains."
01:33:02;01:33:03;"It's on the Upper East Side."
01:33:03;01:33:06;"It's at Lexington between 78th and 79th."
01:33:06;01:33:07;"You could still visit."
01:33:07;01:33:10;"You have to make an email appointment."
01:33:10;01:33:12;"You can't just show up."
01:33:12;01:33:14;"But they have a few visitors a day,"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"and the condo is full of condoms."
01:33:16;01:33:18;"And it was a statement about AIDS."
01:33:18;01:33:19;"Like, that's totally believable."
01:33:19;01:33:23;"And then actually the Whitney was running into some financial trouble,"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"and they had to sell some of their works,"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"and Jay-Z bought the condo full of condoms."
01:33:27;01:33:30;"It only makes sense as a conceptual art project."
01:33:30;01:33:34;"Everything about it is just bizarre."

01:33:47;01:33:51;"It clarifies here that it was first released as a single in '94,"
01:33:51;01:33:55;"and then came back on the charts a year later when it was on the soundtrack."

01:34:26;01:34:28;"After writing the song, he was embarrassed by it."
01:34:28;01:34:34;"And then even in 2015, he said, ""To be honest, I was never really proud of that, of it."
01:34:34;01:34:37;"Although I like what Trevor, the producer, did with the recording."
01:34:37;01:34:41;"He turned that tape from my corner into another eight million record sales,"
01:34:41;01:34:42;"and my name became a household name."""

01:45:45;01:45:48;"we were in the same little green room for ten minutes,"
01:45:48;01:45:50;"I would have been, like, big fan, by the way."
01:45:50;01:45:52;"You know what? Let's put it this way."
01:45:52;01:45:54;"You could say that, as I'm imagining"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"the awkwardness of, like, a publicist"
01:45:56;01:45:58;"from Apple or something, emailing Doug March's publicist"
01:45:58;01:46:00;"and just being like--"
01:46:00;01:46:03;"It's hosted by Ezra from Vampire Weekend,"
01:46:03;01:46:05;"American Painter, Jake Longstreet."
01:46:05;01:46:07;"Previous guests have included"
01:46:07;01:46:10;"Ryan Reese, head of marketing for Hershey's,"

01:46:25;01:46:27;"Bono Bayhurst."
01:46:27;01:46:30;"Oh, yeah, honestly, we've had--"
01:46:30;01:46:31;"I guess I kind of forget."
01:46:31;01:46:33;"Okay, if you really tried to be serious,"
01:46:33;01:46:36;"if you tried to be serious and don't throw in, like,"
01:46:36;01:46:38;"all, like, the corporate food people,"
01:46:38;01:46:39;"I'm sure we could--"
01:46:39;01:46:41;"Which is-- What would that mean to Doug March?"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"He said, ""The guys have had Jamie Foxx,"

01:46:49;01:46:52;"We haven't had a lot of musicians on the show."
01:46:52;01:46:54;"Dude from Radiohead."
01:46:54;01:46:55;"Ed O'Brien."
01:46:55;01:46:56;"Right."

01:46:59;01:47:01;"I mean, okay, come on, that's legit."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"Oh, yeah."
01:47:02;01:47:06;"You guys think Doug March is gonna take this much convincing?"
01:47:06;01:47:08;"Well..."
01:47:08;01:47:12;"You see, there's, like, an impetus for the call."
01:47:12;01:47:13;"And I just--"
01:47:13;01:47:15;"If the impetus is, ""Hey, it's funny that"
01:47:15;01:47:17;"""the acronym of your band is the same"
01:47:17;01:47:20;"""as this huge Korean boy band,"""
01:47:20;01:47:22;"that's not, like, a reason for it."
01:47:22;01:47:23;"You know what I mean?"
01:47:23;01:47:25;"Especially, yeah, like, I don't know if--"
01:47:25;01:47:27;"Maybe Doug doesn't f--- with Vampire Weekend"
01:47:27;01:47:29;"and he doesn't understand that, like--"
01:47:29;01:47:31;"No, Doug, actually, this came from Jake,"
01:47:31;01:47:33;"you know, who's an old-school"
01:47:33;01:47:35;"Built to Spill fan."
01:47:35;01:47:38;"Yeah, 'cause maybe he's just picturing it coming from me"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"and he's just like, ""I never liked those guys anyway."
01:47:40;01:47:41;"""I want to f--- it."""
01:47:41;01:47:42;"Like, I don't know."
01:47:42;01:47:43;"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
01:47:43;01:47:46;"Built to Spill had a new album this summer."
01:47:46;01:47:47;"You could, like, reuse it as--"
01:47:47;01:47:48;"What's it called?"
01:47:48;01:47:50;"Built to-- It's a cover album."
01:47:50;01:47:52;"Built to Spill plays the songs of Daniel Johnston."
01:47:52;01:47:54;"Yeah, I listened to that. It's pretty good."
01:47:54;01:47:56;"You know what else we could talk about"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"is that Built to Spill and Vampire Weekend"
01:47:58;01:48:02;"are-- whether he likes us or not,"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"we are in a brotherhood, a fraternity,"
01:48:04;01:48:07;"of bands that have covered Joker Man by Bob Dumb."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"Oh, wow, that is a good in."
01:48:09;01:48:11;"And say, like, these guys actually got the dude"
01:48:11;01:48:13;"who created the Joker Man font"
01:48:13;01:48:15;"and they did original research"
01:48:15;01:48:18;"and confirmed that it is named after the--"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"He's just like, ""What the f---?"""
01:48:20;01:48:22;"How about this?"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"The tone of this show is strange,"
01:48:24;01:48:27;"and we actually have so much respect for Doug Marsh"
01:48:27;01:48:29;"that we don't want to-- How about this?"
01:48:29;01:48:31;"It wouldn't be unreasonable that somebody listening right now"
01:48:31;01:48:33;"might be, like, listening to this and be like,"
01:48:33;01:48:35;"""Guys, I'm best friends with Doug."
01:48:35;01:48:37;"I know him. I worked with him in some capacity."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"He's a totally easygoing guy."
01:48:39;01:48:42;"He would totally be down with the tone of the show."""
01:48:42;01:48:45;"If anybody's listening and has that relationship with him,"
01:48:45;01:48:47;"then maybe you can hit us up"
01:48:47;01:48:49;"or just reach out yourself and just let them know."
01:48:49;01:48:51;"They were kind of sheepish on the show."
01:48:51;01:48:53;"They felt shy about it."
01:48:53;01:48:55;"If it came via publicist, it might seem kind of bizarre."
01:48:55;01:48:57;"But I vouch for these guys."
01:48:57;01:48:59;"I've listened a lot."
01:48:59;01:49:01;"Like, you'll feel right at home."
01:49:01;01:49:03;"They're actually fans. I don't know."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"The small impression that I have of him"
01:49:05;01:49:07;"is that he would obviously--"
01:49:07;01:49:09;"He's a low-key, down-to-earth guy with a good sense of humor"
01:49:09;01:49:11;"that would totally get the show."
01:49:11;01:49:13;"But going through publicist seems hilarious."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"I'm sure there's somebody listening"
01:49:15;01:49:18;"who's at least one degree of separation from Doug Marsh."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"-Yep. -All right."

01:50:38;01:50:40;"about the tragic death of his son,"

01:50:49;01:50:51;"No, originally it was on the soundtrack"
01:50:51;01:50:54;"for a movie called ""Rush"" from 1992."
01:50:54;01:50:56;"Like, do you guys know the 1992 movie ""Rush""?"

01:51:06;01:51:09;"Yep. Oh, it's a period piece in the '70s."
01:51:09;01:51:11;"So I always kind of wondered, like, not judging,"
01:51:11;01:51:14;"but I'm just like, the song ""Tears in Heaven"""
01:51:14;01:51:17;"is about, like, truly, probably,"
01:51:17;01:51:20;"one of the most brutal things a human being could go through."
01:51:20;01:51:24;"Just, like, absolutely terrible, heartbreaking story."
01:51:24;01:51:26;"And I've just always been--"
01:51:26;01:51:27;"maybe it says on Wikipedia--"
01:51:27;01:51:29;"I've always been curious about, like,"
01:51:29;01:51:32;"I guess maybe he was assigned to write music"
01:51:32;01:51:35;"for this movie, and his son had just died."
01:51:35;01:51:37;"Assigned?"
01:51:37;01:51:39;"Yeah, maybe he already, like, said he would."
01:51:39;01:51:41;"Just, like-- And then he's like--"
01:51:41;01:51:44;"One of the most famous rock stars ever, like,"
01:51:44;01:51:46;"""Oh, dude, you have to write a song"
01:51:46;01:51:49;"for this random-ass, like, movie."""
01:51:49;01:51:52;"Oh, wait, I guess maybe he scored the movie, too."
01:51:52;01:51:54;"Okay, all right, so this makes sense."
01:51:54;01:51:56;"So basically, this is what it says."
01:51:56;01:51:59;"So even before his son died, in 1990,"
01:51:59;01:52:02;"two of his roadies and his friend and fellow musician,"
01:52:02;01:52:04;"Stevie Ray Vaughan, SRV,"
01:52:04;01:52:06;"were killed in a helicopter accident."
01:52:06;01:52:08;"And then, less than a year later,"
01:52:08;01:52:10;"his 4-year-old son, Connor, died,"
01:52:10;01:52:12;"falling out of a window, tragic story."
01:52:12;01:52:13;"Jesus."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"Yeah, like, f---, how heavy does it get?"
01:52:15;01:52:16;"Like, terrible."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"So he was in a real f---ed-up period."
01:52:18;01:52:19;"He was isolated."
01:52:19;01:52:21;"And I guess he had already been--"
01:52:21;01:52:23;"he was supposed to score this movie."
01:52:23;01:52:25;"And he said of the song, ""It was in the back of my head,"
01:52:25;01:52:27;"but it didn't really have a reason for being"
01:52:27;01:52:28;"until I was scoring this movie."
01:52:28;01:52:30;"Then it sort of had a reason to be."
01:52:30;01:52:32;"It is a little ambiguous, because it could be taken"
01:52:32;01:52:34;"to be about Connor, but it is also meant"
01:52:34;01:52:36;"to be part of the film."""
01:52:36;01:52:38;"So maybe he was in this weird f---ed-up place,"
01:52:38;01:52:41;"and he was like, just wanted to get back to work,"
01:52:41;01:52:42;"and he starts writing a song."
01:52:42;01:52:44;"And he's, of course, like, thinking about death,"
01:52:44;01:52:46;"and he's trying to make it about the movie,"
01:52:46;01:52:47;"but it also makes him think of his son."
01:52:47;01:52:49;"All right, so that makes sense."
01:52:49;01:52:53;"It is like a strange place it ended up, but--"
01:52:53;01:52:55;"I only know the MTV Unplugged version."
01:52:55;01:52:57;"I guess there's probably a studio version"
01:52:57;01:53:00;"that was originally on that soundtrack."
01:53:00;01:53:02;"Which I've never heard."
01:53:02;01:53:03;"Never heard?"
01:53:03;01:53:06;"I think I've only heard that song on the radio,"
01:53:06;01:53:10;"because it's been on the radio constantly for decades."
01:53:10;01:53:12;"And I feel like the definitive version"
01:53:12;01:53:14;"is that Unplugged version."
01:53:14;01:53:15;"Well, throw this one on."

01:55:39;01:55:40;"Whoa."
01:55:40;01:55:41;"Fire."
01:55:41;01:55:42;"I got a..."
01:55:42;01:55:43;"That's really good."
01:55:43;01:55:46;"I mean, yeah, he has a very high batting average"
01:55:46;01:55:51;"of like deep TC references per like measure, you know?"
01:55:51;01:55:52;"I mean, like..."
01:55:52;01:55:53;"[laughs]"
01:55:53;01:55:56;"Without ever breaking theme."
01:55:56;01:55:57;"Yeah, no."
01:55:57;01:55:58;"Ever."
01:55:58;01:55:59;"Yeah."
01:55:59;01:56:00;"He's a master. I mean..."
01:56:00;01:56:01;"It's never a forced reference."
01:56:01;01:56:02;"[laughs]"
01:56:02;01:56:03;"No."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"Getting the wet burrito beans on your chunky donkeys."
01:56:05;01:56:06;"[laughs]"
01:56:06;01:56:09;"And of course, he had the worst margarita of his life."
01:56:09;01:56:10;"Yeah."
01:56:10;01:56:11;"It all makes sense."
01:56:11;01:56:13;"At this Mexican restaurant eating the wet-ass burrito."
01:56:13;01:56:14;"[laughs]"
01:56:14;01:56:16;"You know how Ezra always talks about like the perfect"
01:56:16;01:56:18;"sort of narrative and never sort of forcing it?"
01:56:18;01:56:19;"[laughs]"
01:56:19;01:56:22;"This is, I think, yeah."
01:56:22;01:56:23;"It's amazing."
01:56:23;01:56:24;"It's putting it together."
01:56:24;01:56:26;"Well done, Patrick World."
01:56:26;01:56:30;"The number one song this week in 1995,"
01:56:30;01:56:32;"I guess, you know, I'm realizing something."
01:56:32;01:56:34;"It's like, I guess this is obvious."
01:56:34;01:56:36;"We've talked about it before, but it's like,"
01:56:36;01:56:39;"when we do mid to late '90s top fives,"
01:56:39;01:56:40;"I know it so well."
01:56:40;01:56:44;"I know it even better than like when I was like college age later."
01:56:44;01:56:45;"I don't know it quite as well."
01:56:45;01:56:49;"But these songs, like there's something about being 11"
01:56:49;01:56:52;"where you just like, you absorb these songs."
01:56:52;01:56:55;"So they all like strike a chord in me."
01:56:55;01:56:58;"And number one, this is just a total classic."
01:56:58;01:56:59;"Mariah Carey fantasy."
01:56:59;01:57:02;"It's built on the Tom Tom Club sample."
01:57:02;01:57:03;"Love this."
01:57:03;01:57:04;"Hell yeah."
01:57:04;01:57:07;"I feel like, Jake, when we first met on tour with Dirty Projectors,"
01:57:07;01:57:12;"I had like a big brick iPod and I remember this song was on it."
01:57:12;01:57:14;"I feel like we listened to this a lot."
01:57:14;01:57:16;"I remember, yeah."
01:57:16;01:57:19;"This, you know, '95 is a funny days between"
01:57:19;01:57:21;"because you were 11, I was 18."
01:57:21;01:57:23;"That's a weird days between moment."
01:57:23;01:57:24;"That's a funny hang."
01:57:24;01:57:26;"I mean, yeah, I was a freshman in college."
01:57:26;01:57:27;"Yeah."
01:57:52;01:57:53;"Incredible."
01:57:53;01:57:55;"Such a feel good song."
01:57:55;01:57:57;"Yep."
01:58:37;01:58:39;"So it's not the remix with ODB."
01:58:39;01:58:40;"Straight up original."
01:58:40;01:58:42;"That was also such a classic verse."
01:58:42;01:58:46;"It was still kind of novel at the time to have like Mariah Carey,"
01:58:46;01:58:49;"this kind of like, at the time her image was still pretty like prim,"
01:58:49;01:58:52;"you know, like, and then ODB,"
01:58:52;01:58:55;"obviously his name is old dirty bastard."
01:58:55;01:58:57;"Just like bad boy."
01:58:57;01:58:59;"Just come up, me, I'm a Raya."
01:58:59;01:59:01;"Go back like baby just pass the fire."
01:59:01;01:59:02;"This is incredible."
01:59:02;01:59:05;"I remember even like when she put out Heartbreaker,"
01:59:05;01:59:08;"which was like, I don't know, late nineties or something."
01:59:08;01:59:09;"And Jay-Z was on there."
01:59:09;01:59:10;"Yeah."
01:59:10;01:59:11;"I was like, oh, cool."
01:59:11;01:59:13;"Like that's an interesting combo."
01:59:13;01:59:15;"And he had a great verse on that."
01:59:15;01:59:18;"It was like the perfect verse for like everybody."
01:59:18;01:59:21;"You could be like a 10 year old, you know."
01:59:21;01:59:24;"Kid just like rapping along everywhere."
01:59:24;01:59:26;"All right."
01:59:26;01:59:27;"Shout out to Mariah Carey."
01:59:27;01:59:30;"You're an absolute legend, mate."
01:59:30;01:59:33;"The number one song right now on Apple music,"
01:59:33;01:59:35;"Pop Smoke, Rest in Peace,"
01:59:35;01:59:37;"Four of the Night featuring Lil Baby and Da Baby."
01:59:37;01:59:40;"This is the song with both babies."
02:00:04;02:00:05;"Oh yeah."
02:00:05;02:00:06;"I'm a thief in the night."
02:00:06;02:00:10;"I did some wrong, but I'm always right."
02:00:10;02:00:13;"Said I know how to shoot and I know how to fight."
02:00:13;02:00:17;"If I tell you once, I'ma tell you twice."
02:00:17;02:00:21;"I'm real discreet like a thief in the night."
02:00:21;02:00:25;"If I call you babe, you'll be babe for the day"
02:00:25;02:00:27;"or a babe for the night."
02:00:27;02:00:31;"You're not my wife, she want a killer."
02:00:31;02:00:33;"So f*** four nine."
02:00:33;02:00:35;"I want a f*** on a d***."
02:00:35;02:00:37;"Four nine."
02:00:37;02:00:39;"AP, Big Rocks."
02:00:39;02:00:41;"In the hood with the realest."
02:00:41;02:00:43;"5K on the dinner."
02:00:45;02:00:46;"Damn."
02:00:46;02:00:47;"I wonder where they went."
02:00:47;02:00:49;"In LA?"
02:00:49;02:00:51;"I'm going to assume so."
02:00:51;02:00:53;"Is there a place you could drop 5K on dinner"
02:00:53;02:00:55;"for two people in LA?"
02:00:55;02:00:58;"I think the thing with really expensive dinners"
02:00:58;02:01:01;"is it's always the alcohol that puts it over the top."
02:01:01;02:01:04;"You get like a thousand dollar bottle of wine or something?"
02:01:04;02:01:08;"I mean, you could get probably a four thousand dollar bottle of wine."
02:01:08;02:01:09;"Right."
02:01:09;02:01:11;"Jake, what's the most you ever spent on a bottle of wine?"
02:01:11;02:01:13;"I don't know, man."
02:01:13;02:01:14;"Not a lot."
02:01:14;02:01:17;"I mean, 20 or 30."
02:01:17;02:01:21;"We went to some nicer event and we bought a 40 dollar bottle of wine."
02:01:21;02:01:25;"You end up just putting on the kitchen counter"
02:01:25;02:01:28;"and it just ends up sitting there being unopened."
02:01:28;02:01:29;"Right."
02:01:29;02:01:30;"That kind of vibe."
02:01:30;02:01:35;"I don't just buy a 50 dollar bottle of wine to drink by myself."
02:01:35;02:01:37;"We should have talked about that with Spike."
02:01:37;02:01:38;"That's another thing."
02:01:38;02:01:39;"Maybe I should."
02:01:39;02:01:40;"He's getting into wine."
02:01:40;02:01:42;"Yeah, he shut down the art vibe pretty hard,"
02:01:42;02:01:46;"but he definitely seemed in on expensive booze."
02:01:46;02:01:49;"There's something about that that's a type of dude."
02:01:49;02:01:53;"You know, there's a magazine called Guitar Aficionado."
02:01:53;02:01:56;"I always heard about it from Dave Maklovich from Chromio."
02:01:56;02:01:58;"He was always obsessed with that magazine he sang"
02:01:58;02:02:01;"because their thing is that their world view"
02:02:01;02:02:03;"or what they describe, what they write about,"
02:02:03;02:02:05;"is called the deluxe life."
02:02:05;02:02:10;"I think it basically is like whiskey, guitars, and cars."
02:02:10;02:02:12;"And I'm sure watches a little bit."
02:02:12;02:02:13;"Motorcycles."
02:02:13;02:02:15;"Maybe motorcycles."
02:02:15;02:02:16;"Deluxe life."
02:02:16;02:02:19;"So he kind of uses deluxe life as a shorthand sometimes"
02:02:19;02:02:21;"to describe that universe."
02:02:21;02:02:24;"And maybe art is not totally--"
02:02:24;02:02:27;"I can imagine some art is deluxe life, but not all of it."
02:02:27;02:02:29;"Art is too prissy."
02:02:29;02:02:30;"I guess it depends."
02:02:30;02:02:34;"What's that Western guy who made the sculptures of cowboys"
02:02:34;02:02:37;"that George W. Bush had in the Oval Office?"
02:02:37;02:02:38;"I don't know, man."
02:02:38;02:02:42;"Remember every president brings one thing to the Oval Office?"
02:02:42;02:02:43;"Oh, yeah."
02:02:43;02:02:46;"I feel like every president redecorates the entire White"
02:02:46;02:02:50;"House with art from the National Gallery's collection."
02:02:50;02:02:51;"Oh, OK."
02:02:51;02:02:57;"So like Carol Walker and more contemporary artists,"
02:02:57;02:02:59;"a lot of African-American artists."
02:02:59;02:03:02;"I'm sure Trump was like full kitsch."
02:03:02;02:03:03;"OK."
02:03:03;02:03:05;"You know what he's been like?"
02:03:05;02:03:08;"If Trump had like Jeff Koons everywhere in the White House,"
02:03:08;02:03:09;"that would be amazing."
02:03:09;02:03:11;"I'm sure he doesn't, but that would be perfect."
02:03:11;02:03:14;"OK, so the thing that George W. Bush had in the Oval Office"
02:03:14;02:03:18;"was a Frederick Remington."
02:03:18;02:03:19;"He's a fan."
02:03:19;02:03:22;"He's like a 19th century artist."
02:03:22;02:03:23;"He's a painter."
02:03:23;02:03:24;"Yeah, great painter."
02:03:24;02:03:26;"His sculptures are pretty interesting."
02:03:26;02:03:27;"They're well made."
02:03:27;02:03:29;"Like this one's called the Rattlesnake."
02:03:29;02:03:32;"He had another famous one called the Bronco Buster."
02:03:32;02:03:35;"You know, it's like these dramatic cowboys and the horses"
02:03:35;02:03:37;"like rearing up."
02:03:37;02:03:39;"Anyway, they can kind of be deluxe."
02:03:39;02:03:40;"Yeah, but I don't know."
02:03:40;02:03:41;"It is like a funny thing."
02:03:41;02:03:44;"Just like, oh, yeah, I just paid $800,000."
02:03:44;02:03:45;"I don't even know."
02:03:45;02:03:47;"Millions for a Frederick Remington?"
02:03:47;02:03:48;"No idea."
02:03:48;02:03:49;"That's a good question."
02:03:49;02:03:51;"I don't know."
02:03:51;02:03:53;"The secondary market."
02:03:53;02:03:57;"The lowest price you can pay for a Remington is $75,000."
02:03:57;02:03:58;"Oh, really?"
02:03:58;02:04:00;"For a painting or for an etching?"
02:04:00;02:04:02;"For a bronze sculpture."
02:04:02;02:04:04;"Cheaper than a Ferrari."
02:04:04;02:04:05;"That's a good question."
02:04:05;02:04:07;"How big?"
02:04:07;02:04:09;"Seems like they're kind of small."
02:04:09;02:04:10;"Yeah."
02:04:10;02:04:11;"That's the lowest price."
02:04:11;02:04:13;"That's the bottom end."
02:04:13;02:04:16;"You know, I think this is so deep that we're in the end of the"
02:04:16;02:04:18;"episode, we're talking about Frederick Remington."
02:04:18;02:04:20;"He's definitely known more as a painter."
02:04:20;02:04:21;"Okay."
02:04:21;02:04:25;"He's an incredible painter, but it's real cowboys and Indians."
02:04:25;02:04:29;"It's definitely the myth of like Manifest Destiny."
02:04:29;02:04:30;"Right."
02:04:30;02:04:32;"And like cowboys shooting guns at Indians."
02:04:32;02:04:37;"I mean, he nails the dust and the sunlight and the heat."
02:04:37;02:04:40;"But it's weird to see."
02:04:40;02:04:42;"It's like a John Wayne movie."
02:04:42;02:04:43;"I see."
02:04:43;02:04:44;"Problematic."
02:04:44;02:04:48;"Well, on that note, Frederick Remington, you're canceled."
02:04:48;02:04:55;"This is the end of Time Crisis."
02:04:55;02:04:58;"Thank you to our guests, Uncle Ted and Spike."
02:04:58;02:05:03;"We'll see you in two weeks."
02:05:03;02:05:06;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
