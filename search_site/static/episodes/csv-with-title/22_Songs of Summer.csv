00:00;00:17;"Time Crisis, Summer 2016. Raw. This is a summer episode. We're gonna go back to 2006, '96 and '86 to discover what those summers were like."
00:17;00:26;"We're gonna talk to Mike D from the Beastie Boys. We're gonna eat Cool Ranch Doritos. And of course, we're gonna count down the top five."
00:26;00:37;"This is the Summer of Time Crisis with Ezra King. B-B-B-B-B-B-Beasts 411."
01:13;01:26;"Time Crisis, we're back. Two weeks ago we did a 4th of July special where we went through all 50 states. That went down pretty well. But now we're back, it's just a regular
old show. Back here in LA. What's up, Jake?"
01:26;01:28;"Not much, man. New digs."
01:28;01:34;"Yeah, we're at this new studio in Culver City. It's a lot fancier than the room we used to work in."
01:34;01:42;"The last room we worked in, there was just like a college dorm microfridge and a couple folding tables."
01:42;01:47;"Yeah, this room has, what do you think, 14 foot high ceilings?"
01:47;01:49;"Pretty good guess. I might even say 16."
01:49;01:58;"Wow. Alright, 16 foot high ceilings. A lot more like Apple branded panels and light boxes."
01:58;02:08;"Jake, you made the very astute comment you brought a long sleeve shirt because you quote unquote knew the AC would be jacked."
02:08;02:10;"It's true. It's cold in here."
02:10;02:14;"Yeah, what is that? The more corporate a place is, the more jacked the AC is."
02:14;02:16;"Yeah, I think that's true."
02:16;02:22;"I feel like independent movie theaters, it's going to be maybe in the low 70s."
02:22;02:23;"I would say high 70s."
02:23;02:28;"In the high 70s. And then a big corporate chain like at AMC, it's going to be 65."
02:28;02:37;"You're set like a 2pm screening of Independence Day Resurgence, whatever it's called. And it's just like 67 degrees in there."
02:37;02:39;"It's wild. Where do you keep it at your house?"
02:39;02:47;"75 or 78. Honestly, I'm not an AC guy. If we have it like 71, 72, it feels cold."
02:47;02:53;"And if it's 90 out and you walk into your house and it's 78, that feels great."
02:53;02:54;"Yeah."
02:54;02:58;"Like 78 with ceiling fans, you're golden."
02:58;03:05;"Yeah. And I can't remember what I keep it at in LA. In New York, I just have like a window."
03:05;03:08;"You say 70 on the, you don't know what the temperature actually is."
03:08;03:12;"The place I'm living in now is the first place I've had or lived in that had AC."
03:12;03:13;"Really?"
03:13;03:14;"Yeah."
03:14;03:15;"You just lived without AC?"
03:15;03:16;"Yeah."
03:16;03:19;"So it would just be like 100 degrees outside and what were you doing?"
03:19;03:22;"Fans, you know."
03:22;03:23;"Wet paper towel on the back of your neck?"
03:23;03:26;"Yeah, being hot, hanging out shirtless."
03:26;03:31;"You know, it's interesting. In a lot of Europe, they don't really have AC."
03:31;03:40;"So like Germany, which is a, by most people's standards, a very evolved country in terms of like quality of life or whatever."
03:40;03:44;"People eat well, exercise, blah, blah, blah."
03:44;03:49;"There's no, even at like rich people's houses, it's just hot."
03:49;03:50;"Huh."
03:50;03:51;"It just like opened the windows."
03:51;03:52;"Old school."
03:52;03:53;"Yeah."
03:53;03:56;"I wonder about like at like offices and corporate and government buildings and whatnot."
03:56;03:59;"Yeah, it's probably a little more jacked."
04:18;04:25;"Laughing all our cares away, just you and I"
04:25;04:33;"Sweet, sleepy warmth of summer nights"
04:33;04:40;"Gazing at the distant lights in the starry sky"
04:42;04:49;"They say that all good things must end someday"
04:49;04:55;"Autumn leaves must fall"
04:55;05:01;"They say that all good things must end someday"
05:01;05:07;"Autumn leaves must fall"
05:07;05:12;"Yeah, Europe's alright. I definitely, you know, of course all countries are great in their own way"
05:12;05:15;"I tend to have a better time in Italy than in France"
05:15;05:19;"Maybe it's just because I'm a real Italian food"
05:19;05:27;"Aficionado. I feel that. Pasta just tastes so good, man. One thing I'll tell you that I got was difficult for me though is"
05:27;05:33;"The two-hour Italian lunch phenomenon. Wow. It's like a beautiful thing"
05:33;05:39;"I think it's great that people like sit down with their families more than in America. People take off work, go home, eat"
05:39;05:45;"But I get really like maybe just because I'm such like a dip-shit American"
05:45;05:52;"You know everything all the time. I just need it fast that you know because I've always been the type of dude"
05:52;05:59;"Just like you know grab like the cold cuts out of the fridge eat it over the garbage can that's lunch. Yeah, you know"
05:59;06:06;"Go go go go go go gotta keep moving. Puritan work ethic. Yeah, I guess"
06:06;06:12;"Hypercapitalist, yeah non-stop infinite growth, but so in Italy"
06:12;06:18;"People sit down with and have like kind of coursed out meals and sit and talk with the family"
06:18;06:23;"It's nice, but then I'd really I feel like this physical sensation after I eat lunch"
06:23;06:26;"Which is like I just got to like move or lie down"
06:26;06:30;"Yeah, I just can't keep sitting at the table, and then it's a little bit like oh who wants an espresso"
06:30;06:33;"and then like bring up the espresso, and then you just like chilling and"
06:33;06:39;"Chatting and it almost made me feel like a child again. Just like may I be excused"
06:39;06:42;"But you know maybe it's like I gotta just work on my"
06:42;06:49;"My attention deficit disorder, I guess I mean the funny thing is I can't imagine you had things that were pressing that you had to get"
06:49;06:55;"To while you're in Italy on vacation no of course not I gotta get to this email like what no no"
06:55;06:58;"But you know it's funny. It's like life puts those"
06:58;07:04;"Feelings into you, and it's hard to unwind so it's like yeah of course you're out there in Italy just chilling"
07:04;07:07;"There's nothing you have to get to but then your body"
07:07;07:13;"Responds as if you have something to get to stress is a choice fight-or-flight"
07:13;07:22;"Adrenaline were you drinking at lunch like red wine often Wow yeah, that would put me to sleep pasta and red wine at like"
07:22;07:25;"30 one well then and then you have the espresso"
07:25;07:30;"Okay, so that kind of and then me and then my most y'all and then maybe a siesta"
07:30;07:34;"Also, I think I don't know if this is true or not, but I think"
07:34;07:36;"Italian people"
07:36;07:38;"know how to"
07:38;07:43;"Not go crazy with the pasta, but again coming from my American"
07:43;07:50;"Hyper-capitalist all about me greed old spaghetti factory I"
07:51;07:56;"Just I just can't yeah, I don't know you know Italian people. I think are"
07:56;08:00;"in better health and shape than Americans although some people"
08:00;08:05;"Michael Moore would say it's because of their six weeks of paid vacation versus our"
08:05;08:07;"zero"
08:07;08:14;"That might have something to do with it, but also. I just feel like when there's a big beautiful ball of pasta on the table I"
08:14;08:17;"Could truly have infinite servings of it"
08:17;08:22;"I have no impulse control whereas like some Italian people have like a little bowl of pasta and then onto this whatever right"
08:22;08:28;"How do they do that or like my favorite like the classic like Italian restaurant in America vibe? That's like a"
08:28;08:31;"giant chicken parm already like just coated in"
08:31;08:34;"like breadcrumbs"
08:34;08:40;"Already full of carbohydrates, and then for your side a bowl of pasta that always mystified me"
08:40;08:43;"I feel like it's like the plain bowl of pasta"
08:44;08:49;"That you have to put the red sauce on I love Italian food so much chicken parm chicken parm"
08:49;08:54;"I love Italian American food, but of course Italy does have a unique food culture"
08:54;09:00;"We have to go to Colombo sometime. Where's that it's an Eagle Rock. It's near my house. It's like old school"
09:00;09:07;"It's like 1980 North Jersey Italian restaurant. Oh really yeah, that's much live jazz. Oh really"
09:07;09:11;"Yeah, Italian food and jazz two of my greatest pleasures in life"
09:12;09:14;"You're listening to"
09:15;09:17;"Time crisis"
09:17;09:19;"I"
09:19;09:45;"tell you the night"
09:46;09:48;"Nobody touch me in the right"
09:48;09:50;"I"
09:50;10:18;"[R&B music playing]"
10:18;10:22;"Now we're in the thick of summer, so this is gonna be a real summer show."
10:22;10:23;"So for all our listeners at home,"
10:23;10:26;"we're gonna be talking a lot about the songs of the summer."
10:26;10:31;"We're gonna be digging into the mists of time"
10:31;10:33;"to tell you what songs were big in various other summers."
10:33;10:35;"We're going back 10, 20, 30 years."
10:35;10:39;"We're also gonna be chatting a little bit with Mike D"
10:39;10:41;"of Beastie Boys fame,"
10:41;10:46;"who also just started his show, Echo Chamber, on Apple Music."
10:46;10:49;"And of course, the top five songs on iTunes."
10:49;10:52;"Cross-reference of the top five songs of 1968."
10:52;10:56;"Another tense year in America."
10:56;10:58;"All right, man, so it's summer."
10:58;10:59;"- Yeah, man. - We've already been talking"
10:59;11:03;"a little bit on this show about the songs of the summer."
11:03;11:05;"It's summer 2016."
11:05;11:08;"This is shaping up to be a memorable summer,"
11:08;11:09;"to say the least."
11:09;11:11;"- Tumultuous. - Tumultuous."
11:11;11:14;"I mean, I think the summer before an election"
11:14;11:16;"is always gonna be a little crazy."
11:16;11:18;"Yeah, Trump's running around. I mean, it's--"
11:18;11:19;"It's pretty wild."
11:19;11:21;"So before we get into 2016,"
11:21;11:23;"I think it's worth looking back at years past"
11:23;11:25;"to help contextualize what's going on."
11:25;11:27;"So 10 years ago,"
11:27;11:30;"we're gonna work our way back in 10-year segments."
11:30;11:31;"- Cool. - And we're gonna look at"
11:31;11:34;"some of the big songs of various summers."
11:34;11:37;"So let's go back 10 years ago, 2006."
11:37;11:40;"So first of all, let's try to paint a picture,"
11:40;11:41;"'cause we probably got some listeners"
11:41;11:45;"who were either very young in 2006"
11:45;11:48;"or maybe they were abroad with no internet,"
11:48;11:50;"so they might not remember what was going on in 2006."
11:50;11:53;"So in my life, 2006,"
11:53;11:56;"that was actually the first summer I graduated--"
11:56;12:00;"I was out of school, 'cause I graduated college in 2006."
12:00;12:02;"So Vampire Weekend was just getting started,"
12:02;12:04;"making some demos."
12:04;12:07;"I remember I had to do my teacher training"
12:07;12:09;"for my upcoming job as a teacher,"
12:09;12:11;"so that was kind of brutal."
12:11;12:12;"I was out in Queens."
12:12;12:14;"Was that like a full-time training thing,"
12:14;12:15;"Monday through Friday?"
12:15;12:17;"For like a few weeks, it was."
12:17;12:20;"Yeah, so I just have like vague memories of summer 2006."
12:20;12:22;"I was like learning how to be a teacher,"
12:22;12:23;"chilling in New York."
12:23;12:25;"Where'd you live in New York?"
12:25;12:26;"Bed-Stuy? That house?"
12:26;12:28;"I was about to move into Bed-Stuy."
12:28;12:31;"I remember my girlfriend at the time, Sarah."
12:31;12:32;"- You remember Sarah? - Yeah, sure."
12:32;12:33;"Shout-out to Sarah."
12:33;12:36;"She was still in college, so it's that classic,"
12:36;12:38;"like, you know, she was like probably 21,"
12:38;12:41;"ending up in some weird summer sublet situation."
12:42;12:46;"So she had a sublet, which was this eccentric Italian woman"
12:46;12:49;"in Hell's Kitchen, who had a massive loft"
12:49;12:51;"that was full of like architecture books and stuff."
12:51;12:53;"Maybe she was an architect."
12:53;12:57;"And she divided the apartment up into various rooms"
12:57;12:58;"made out of bookshelves."
12:58;13:00;"So if you entered the apartment in the middle of the night,"
13:00;13:03;"she'd be sleeping, so you had to be very quiet."
13:03;13:07;"And then you go into one of three or four"
13:07;13:09;"little like rental rooms."
13:09;13:11;"So I remember there was like this Spanish dude."
13:11;13:12;"It was actually very international."
13:12;13:14;"There was like this French dude"
13:14;13:15;"who was like playing video games"
13:15;13:17;"and like cursing in French all night."
13:17;13:20;"So I'd be like kind of like sleeping with my girlfriend"
13:20;13:21;"in this funny little bed,"
13:21;13:24;"hearing everything in this apartment."
13:24;13:25;"Wow, very New York."
13:25;13:26;"Very New York."
13:26;13:28;"Yeah, classic, just like overcrowded,"
13:28;13:31;"expensive New York people living in kind of bizarre ways."
13:31;13:32;"Although I look back on it fondly."
13:32;13:34;"But yeah, so I was basically hanging out a lot"
13:34;13:36;"in Hell's Kitchen, learning how to be a teacher."
13:36;13:37;"What were you doing in 2006?"
13:37;13:41;"Living in San Francisco, delivering groceries,"
13:41;13:43;"playing music, but I also remember '06,"
13:43;13:47;"I did a drive across the country with my buddy Steve Schrader,"
13:47;13:50;"and we were photographing big box stores"
13:50;13:53;"and franchise corporate architecture."
13:53;13:55;"So we would like be driving in Ohio,"
13:55;13:57;"and we'd see a Home Depot, pull over,"
13:57;14:00;"photograph the Home Depot, keep driving."
14:00;14:01;"It was a fun trip."
14:01;14:04;"We drove from the East Coast all the way to Portland, Oregon."
14:04;14:05;"Wow."
14:05;14:06;"Took about a week."
14:06;14:07;"You learned a lot about America."
14:07;14:10;"Yeah, got a lot of great images."
14:10;14:12;"So while you were rolling across the country,"
14:12;14:14;"you might have remembered some of these songs"
14:14;14:15;"popping on the radio."
14:15;14:19;"So let's get into the top five songs of summer 2006."
14:19;14:21;"So we're going to start with this one."
14:21;14:23;"Actually, this is Young Jock."
14:23;14:24;"It's going down."
14:24;14:25;"Wait, do I remember this?"
14:25;14:27;"[MUSIC - YOUNG JOCK, ""IT'S GOING DOWN""]"
14:27;14:29;"It's going down."
14:29;14:31;"OK, I think I remember this song."
14:31;14:33;"Young Jock?"
14:33;14:35;"Y-U-N-G, J-O-C."
14:35;14:38;"[MUSIC - YOUNG JOCK, ""IT'S GOING DOWN""]"
14:38;14:46;"Long intro."
14:46;14:49;"[MUSIC - YOUNG JOCK, ""IT'S GOING DOWN""]"
14:49;14:58;"It's modern in a way."
14:58;15:01;"Yeah, if you told me this was brand new, I'd be like, OK."
15:01;15:02;"Yeah."
15:02;15:03;"I believe you."
15:03;15:04;"I mean, this is like the kind of stuff"
15:04;15:09;"before trap music had truly crossed over into pop music."
15:09;15:10;"This stuff had like similar--"
15:10;15:14;"similar tempo."
15:14;15:16;"Yeah."
15:16;15:17;"It's like a one--"
15:17;15:21;"it's like a one minor chord jam."
15:21;15:24;"Back then, it would often be snaps."
15:24;15:24;"I like that."
15:24;15:27;"[MUSIC - YOUNG JOCK, ""IT'S GOING DOWN""]"
15:27;15:30;"This is pretty unexceptional, though."
15:30;15:31;"I think I would--"
15:31;15:33;"hold on, you haven't heard the chorus yet."
15:33;15:36;"[MUSIC - YOUNG JOCK, ""IT'S GOING DOWN""]"
15:36;15:40;"[MUSIC - YOUNG JOCK, ""IT'S GOING DOWN""]"
16:32;16:35;"All right, I got-- this makes me think--"
16:35;16:36;"this makes me think of something."
16:36;16:39;"So Jake, do you know what the trap is?"
16:39;16:40;"No."
16:40;16:43;"When you were like, trap music crossed over, I was--"
16:43;16:44;"what is that?"
16:44;16:47;"I'm far from an expert, but the trap"
16:47;16:48;"refers to like drug dealing."
16:48;16:50;"So the trap would be like a location"
16:50;16:52;"involved in drug dealing."
16:52;16:56;"And I can only speak as like a suburban white person."
16:56;16:58;"But it's interesting, because like, I think"
16:58;17:01;"when this song came out in 2006, when Young Jock was saying,"
17:01;17:05;"you can find me in the trap, the vast majority of white people"
17:05;17:07;"hearing that on the radio were not"
17:07;17:08;"familiar with the word trap."
17:08;17:11;"I think I would have thought of like some like nautical themed"
17:11;17:13;"bar or something."
17:13;17:13;"The trap?"
17:13;17:15;"Yeah, like, meet me at the trap."
17:15;17:16;"Right."
17:16;17:19;"So anyway, congratulations on the word trap."
17:19;17:21;"I wonder what that guy's doing now."
17:21;17:21;"Young Jock?"
17:21;17:22;"Is he still doing it?"
17:22;17:24;"I don't think he's had a top five hit in a while."
17:24;17:25;"Yeah."
17:25;17:27;"But he's doing his thing."
17:27;17:30;"The next song from summer 2006 was by Cassie."
17:30;17:31;"You remember Cassie?"
17:31;17:32;"Oh, I remember this."
17:32;17:34;"Yeah, and she was dating Diddy for a while."
17:34;17:35;"I think she's from Connecticut."
17:35;17:36;"Really?"
17:36;17:38;"Connecticut's own Cassie."
17:38;17:41;"On that drive with Steve Trader, photographing Home Depot."
17:41;17:42;"This was on the radio a ton."
17:42;17:45;"I remember him being like, so into this song."
17:45;17:45;"Mm-hmm."
17:45;17:55;"This song sounds very modern, too."
17:58;18:04;"I mean, has production changed a ton the last 10 years?"
18:04;18:05;"In some ways."
18:05;18:06;"I mean--"
18:06;18:08;"I know that's a real general question, but--"
18:08;18:16;"I mean, that orc stab sounds a little--"
18:16;18:18;"places this to me in like a different era."
18:18;18:24;"Also, vocal sound has changed a lot."
18:24;18:25;"Yeah, that's true."
18:28;18:31;"This is like a pretty straightforward dry vocal."
18:31;18:37;"If this song hadn't been a hit song,"
18:37;18:40;"and somebody just gave us the session,"
18:40;18:42;"we could make a few small changes"
18:42;18:43;"and get it on the radio today."
18:43;18:44;"Right."
18:44;18:45;"[music - ""i do""]"
18:45;18:49;"(SINGING) Now, baby, tell me how you like it."
18:49;18:55;"I was waiting for you to tell me you were ready."
18:55;18:59;"I know what to do if only you would let me."
18:59;19:03;"As long as you're cool with it, I'll treat you right."
19:03;19:07;"Here is where you want to be."
19:07;19:11;"I know that my guys, they've been talking about the way"
19:11;19:14;"I do, I do."
19:14;19:15;"They heard I was good."
19:15;19:18;"They want to see if it's true."
19:18;19:22;"They know you're the one I want to give it to."
19:22;19:25;"I can see you want me too."
19:25;19:28;"And now it's me, it's me."
19:28;19:31;"Now, baby, I've been waiting for you."
19:31;19:32;"Think I'm gonna make it."
19:32;19:34;"I'm thinking about making it now."
19:34;19:36;"Baby, tell me if you like it."
19:36;19:38;"Tell me if you need it."
19:38;19:44;"You're listening to ""Time Crisis"" on Beats 1."
19:44;19:45;"Great song."
19:45;19:47;"Connecticut's own Cassie with me and you."
19:47;19:51;"I remember Steve telling me that song was about oral."
19:51;19:52;"Excuse me?"
19:52;19:53;"Giving oral."
19:53;19:55;"You know, all songs are about oral."
19:55;19:56;"No."
19:56;19:57;"They say that--"
19:57;19:58;"All songs."
19:58;20:02;"They say that before the post-war American boom--"
20:02;20:04;"well, there's two great traditions of music, right?"
20:04;20:05;"There's--"
20:05;20:07;"Here we go."
20:07;20:09;"There's-- you know, because back in the day,"
20:09;20:12;"music was very much controlled, at least in Europe,"
20:12;20:13;"by the church."
20:13;20:16;"So music-- there's the two great traditions of music"
20:16;20:18;"are religious and secular."
20:18;20:20;"And secular music's really exploded"
20:20;20:22;"in the era of mass media."
20:22;20:25;"But before that, the most famous music was church music."
20:25;20:27;"And so people sometimes say the only difference"
20:27;20:29;"between church music and secular music"
20:29;20:30;"is who you're talking about."
20:30;20:33;"Because in church music, you're talking about God."
20:33;20:35;"So you could say in secular music,"
20:35;20:36;"you're talking about sex."
20:36;20:37;"I guess so."
20:37;20:39;"You could have a church song called ""Me and You."""
20:39;20:39;"Yeah."
20:39;20:42;"""Me"" is me, and ""you"" is God."
20:42;20:45;"""Sweet Home Alabama."""
20:45;20:49;"In ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" the Alabama"
20:49;20:54;"is the secular governmental state known as Alabama."
20:54;20:59;"But the gospel Christian version is more about sweet home, Zion,"
20:59;21:00;"heaven."
21:00;21:01;"What happened to Cassie?"
21:01;21:03;"What happened to her career?"
21:03;21:03;"I don't know."
21:03;21:05;"She was, like, dating Diddy for a while."
21:05;21:07;"I hate that I know so much gossip"
21:07;21:09;"about people's private lives."
21:09;21:13;"The next song from 2006--"
21:13;21:14;"well, this was a big hit, man."
21:14;21:15;"OK."
21:15;21:18;"Back in 2006."
21:18;21:18;"Oh, yeah."
21:18;21:19;"[music - ""me and you""]"
21:19;21:20;"(SINGING) I remember when--"
21:20;21:22;"I remember, I remember when I lost my mind."
21:22;21:25;"This sounds more like a different era."
21:25;21:26;"Although even this, if it came out today,"
21:26;21:27;"it'd change a few things."
21:27;21:29;"It'd be a hit."
21:29;21:31;"But this, at the time, was kind of a throwback."
21:31;21:32;"Right."
21:32;21:33;"Wait."
21:33;21:37;"It's got, like, analog drums and the--"
21:37;21:39;"Yeah, even the melody, the songwriting--"
21:39;21:40;"Yeah, it feels like a '60s--"
21:40;21:42;"--seems more like Al Greeney or something."
21:42;21:43;"Yeah."
21:43;21:45;"I'm going to try to remember who this is by."
21:45;21:46;"Oh, is this CeeLo?"
21:46;21:47;"It's CeeLo singing."
21:47;21:49;"It's this group called Norris Barclays."
21:49;21:50;"Oh, that's right."
21:50;21:55;"(SINGING) Does that make me crazy?"
21:55;21:59;"Does that make me crazy?"
21:59;22:03;"Does that make me crazy?"
22:03;22:04;"Possibly."
22:04;22:16;"And all that you have in the time of your life,"
22:16;22:17;"well, think twice."
22:17;22:21;"That's my only advice."
22:21;22:27;"Mm, come on now."
22:27;22:29;"Who do you-- who do you-- who do you--"
22:29;22:32;"who do you think you are?"
22:32;22:33;"Ha, ha, ha."
22:33;22:37;"Bless your soul."
22:37;22:41;"You really think you're in control?"
22:41;22:46;"Well, I think you're crazy."
22:46;22:50;"I think you're crazy."
22:50;22:53;"Yeah, it's like all the-- like, the strings and the vocals"
22:53;22:56;"are very '60s and '70s."
22:56;23:00;"And then the beat was whatever, 2006."
23:00;23:02;"Yeah, this is kind of like--"
23:02;23:06;"it's a good song."
23:06;23:07;"I gotta say, all these 2006 songs are not"
23:07;23:08;"really doing anything for me."
23:08;23:10;"I mean, they're all good songs."
23:10;23:11;"But it's like--"
23:11;23:12;"Are they?"
23:12;23:14;"Yeah, they're pretty good."
23:14;23:17;"The Young Jock and the Cassie were--"
23:17;23:21;"they've been relegated to the dustbin of history."
23:21;23:22;"Oh my god."
23:22;23:23;"For a reason."
23:23;23:24;"Come on."
23:24;23:26;"All these songs are good."
23:26;23:27;"I'm just saying, like--"
23:27;23:30;"Define good."
23:30;23:31;"You said so yourself, dude."
23:31;23:32;"You're not feeling it."
23:32;23:34;"I'm not Socrates, man."
23:34;23:36;"I'm not going to define good."
23:36;23:38;"No, but I'm saying more like, you know,"
23:38;23:40;"I thought listening to songs from 10 years ago"
23:40;23:43;"would maybe, like, trigger a wave of emotions."
23:43;23:43;"Yeah."
23:43;23:46;"And Proustian memories."
23:46;23:47;"But so far, it hasn't."
23:47;23:50;"I remember I liked this song."
23:50;23:51;"I always loved that."
23:51;23:54;"Yeah, this is cool."
23:54;23:55;"I remember this, but I don't remember--"
23:55;23:57;"I like that kind of beautiful, almost like baroque--"
23:57;23:58;"Yeah."
23:58;24:00;"Who is this?"
24:00;24:02;"Shakira featuring Wyclef."
24:02;24:05;"This-- OK, this actually did trigger a really stupid memory"
24:05;24:05;"for me."
24:05;24:08;"So he goes, na, na, na, na, you could dance like this."
24:08;24:10;"She make a man want to speak Spanish."
24:10;24:12;"And I remember, like, somehow--"
24:12;24:13;"I don't know if I misheard it or something,"
24:13;24:15;"but I thought it was like, she make"
24:15;24:16;"a man want to learn Spanish."
24:16;24:19;"And then I would, like, picture, like, Wyclef--"
24:19;24:21;"like, that Wyclef met Shakira."
24:21;24:23;"And he was like, oh my god, she's so beautiful."
24:23;24:25;"And then, like, six months of intensive study of him,"
24:25;24:26;"just like in a Spanish--"
24:26;24:29;"like, an adult education Spanish class."
24:29;24:31;"She make a man want to learn Spanish."
24:31;24:32;"And just like--"
24:32;24:33;"Books on tape."
24:33;24:34;"Yeah, like, listening to books on tape,"
24:34;24:38;"like, doing worksheets, like, conjugating a star."
24:38;24:40;"Yeah."
24:40;24:41;"Me gusto."
24:41;24:44;"Oh, baby, when you talk like that,"
24:44;24:46;"you make a woman go mad."
24:46;24:50;"So be wise and keep on reading the signs of my blood."
24:50;24:51;"Love Shakira's voice."
24:51;24:52;"It's so unusual."
24:52;24:53;"Yeah."
24:53;24:54;"Where's she from?"
24:54;24:55;"South America or something?"
24:55;24:56;"Colombia."
24:56;24:57;"OK."
24:57;25:01;"I think she's, like, of partially Lebanese descent."
25:01;25:02;"[music - ""bobby jones""]"
25:02;25:03;"(SINGING) I can see your body moving."
25:03;25:05;"And it's driving me crazy."
25:05;25:06;"This feels like--"
25:06;25:07;"This is funny."
25:07;25:08;"--15 years ago, actually."
25:08;25:10;"(SINGING) --so you dancing."
25:10;25:12;"And when you walk up on the dance floor,"
25:12;25:15;"nobody can not ignore the way you move your body."
25:15;25:16;"And everything's so unexpected--"
25:16;25:18;"Listen to that, like--"
25:18;25:19;"[imitates bass]"
25:19;25:20;"That bass."
25:20;25:22;"(SINGING) --you really knew that she could dance like this."
25:22;25:23;"She make a man want to speak Spanish."
25:23;25:25;"You know what the name of this album was?"
25:25;25:26;"(SINGING) Como se llama."
25:26;25:26;"(SINGING) Odida."
25:26;25:27;"Ay."
25:27;25:28;"(SINGING) Picasso."
25:28;25:29;"Shakira, Shakira."
25:29;25:32;"(SINGING) Oh, baby, when you talk like that--"
25:32;25:32;"Shakira's a lot--"
25:32;25:34;"[laughs]"
25:34;25:35;"Shakira was--"
25:35;25:36;"What is going on with her voice?"
25:36;25:39;"Shakira was standing a lot closer to the microphone"
25:39;25:39;"than Wyclef."
25:39;25:40;"Yeah, totally."
25:40;25:42;"(SINGING) --you know my voice don't lie."
25:42;25:43;"And I'm starting to feel you, boy."
25:43;25:46;"And when that's done, real soon--"
25:46;25:48;"She definitely emailed her vocals in."
25:48;25:49;"I don't think I've ever listened closely"
25:49;25:51;"to her vocal performances."
25:51;25:54;"I used to be able to do a good Shakira impersonation."
25:54;25:57;"It almost gives me like a Shania vibe."
25:57;25:58;"(SINGING) I'm on tonight."
25:58;26:00;"You know my hips, hips don't lie."
26:00;26:01;"Wait, no, that's not good."
26:01;26:03;"That's not good."
26:03;26:05;"It was like a really flat American accent or something."
26:05;26:07;"(SINGING) --a woman that just seemed to have a plan."
26:07;26:10;"My will, I'm so frustrated."
26:10;26:12;"Have come to fail now, fail now."
26:12;26:14;"See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't."
26:14;26:17;"So you know that's a bit too hard to explain."
26:17;26:18;"She's a--"
26:18;26:19;"Trippy."
26:19;26:22;"--a Colombian-Lebanese person, not American."
26:22;26:23;"That's trippy."
26:23;26:26;"The name of that album was Oral Fixation, Volume 2."
26:26;26:28;"Well, there you go, running theme at 06."
26:28;26:32;"2006, I guess, was the time of oral."
26:32;26:35;"Maybe this is not appropriate for the show, but I think--"
26:35;26:37;"I'm just saying, like, the truth is,"
26:37;26:40;"there's only so many things that two humans can"
26:40;26:43;"do with each other in the bedroom."
26:43;26:44;"There's a ceiling."
26:44;26:46;"There's a ceiling."
26:46;26:48;"You know, the internet, you can do different things"
26:48;26:49;"on the internet."
26:49;26:50;"But as far as two human beings, you"
26:50;26:53;"can only put each thing in so many places."
26:53;26:56;"And I want to say, personally, I think they're all OK."
26:56;26:58;"And I think it's wonderful as long as two consenting adults"
26:58;26:59;"can do."
26:59;27:01;"They can put whatever they want together."
27:01;27:02;"I think that's beautiful, actually."
27:02;27:03;"Absolutely."
27:03;27:05;"But the funny thing is, because there's"
27:05;27:08;"a limited number of things that two consenting adults can"
27:08;27:12;"do with each other, it's been done for literally tens"
27:12;27:13;"of thousands of years."
27:14;27:17;"So there's something so funny about how, like, people"
27:17;27:21;"at different moments find specific sexual acts so--"
27:21;27:24;"especially, like, titillating or humorous."
27:24;27:26;"Like, I think, like, when we were kids, you know,"
27:26;27:30;"probably in large part rooted in homophobia,"
27:30;27:31;"when a kid really wanted to be funny,"
27:31;27:34;"they'd make a joke about, like, [bleep] somebody in the--"
27:34;27:35;"Right."
27:35;27:36;"Like, that was funny."
27:36;27:42;"As if that was a particularly titillating or, like--"
27:42;27:43;"Out-- egregious."
27:43;27:44;"--out there-- yeah."
27:44;27:45;"Yeah."
27:45;27:46;"And it's kind of like, you know what, man?"
27:46;27:49;"Like, people have been doing that for thousands"
27:49;27:50;"and thousands of years."
27:50;27:51;"It's not like it just got discovered."
27:51;27:53;"So then I think there's also-- were probably"
27:53;27:58;"eras where people thought, like, oral sex was particularly wild"
27:58;27:59;"or even, like, funny."
27:59;28:01;"So I just want to say to everybody out there,"
28:01;28:02;"none of it's funny."
28:02;28:02;"It's all beautiful."
28:02;28:04;"Grow up."
28:04;28:05;"Words of wisdom."
28:05;28:08;"So anyway, other people's sexualities"
28:08;28:10;"should not be funny."
28:10;28:11;"Who cares?"
28:11;28:17;"The number one song of summer 2006 was kind of about that."
28:17;28:18;"Am I throwing you off?"
28:18;28:19;"Nope."
28:19;28:20;"Didn't think so."
28:20;28:21;"[music - ""pre-sex negotiation""]"

28:41;28:42;"All I can do is try."
28:42;28:43;"Give me one chance."

28:47;28:48;"I'm curious about you."
28:48;28:49;"You seem so innocent."
28:49;28:51;"You want to get in my world, get lost in it."
28:51;28:52;"Boy, I'm tired of running."
28:52;28:54;"Let's walk for a minute."
28:54;29:00;"Promiscuous girl, whatever you are, I'm all alone."
29:00;29:03;"And it's you that I want."
29:03;29:09;"Promiscuous boy, you already know that I'm all yours."
29:09;29:11;"What you waiting for?"
29:11;29:15;"Promiscuous girl, you teasing me."
29:15;29:19;"You know that I want, and I got what you need."
29:19;29:24;"Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point,"
29:24;29:26;"'cause we on a roll."
29:26;29:27;"You ready?"
29:27;29:29;"Roses are red, some diamonds are blue."
29:29;29:31;"Chivalry is dead, but you're still kind of cute."
29:31;29:33;"Hey, I can't keep my mind off you."
29:33;29:34;"Where you at?"
29:34;29:35;"Do you mind if I come through?"

29:44;29:45;"I'm a big girl."
29:45;29:46;"I can handle myself."
29:46;29:48;"But if we get lonely, I'ma need your help."

29:49;29:50;"I don't talk for my health."
29:50;29:51;"I want you on my team."

29:53;29:54;"Great song."
29:54;29:55;"Yeah."
29:55;29:58;"This song, it's about a promiscuous girl"
29:58;30:01;"and a promiscuous boy coming together"
30:01;30:05;"to negotiate the emotional terms of their sexual relationship."
30:05;30:06;"Right."
30:06;30:07;"Are you going to respect me after?"
30:07;30:09;"It's a conversation not enough people have, to be honest."
30:09;30:10;"Real?"
30:10;30:14;"I mean, so it's a promiscuous boy and a promiscuous girl."
30:14;30:16;"It's not even a question of, are you interested in having sex?"
30:16;30:19;"Well, the first verse is sort of like, yeah,"
30:19;30:24;"like exploring the emotional terrain, which is kind of cool."
30:24;30:25;"It's pretty old school."
30:25;30:28;"It's like pretty-- it's kind of quaint, even."
30:28;30:30;"Like when you listen to old, like '60s Motown."
30:30;30:32;"Yeah, you know what it makes me think of?"
30:32;30:33;"There's an entire song."
30:33;30:35;"There's another song about that."
30:35;30:37;"It's cool that this is like between a guy and a girl."
30:37;30:38;"They're both expressing their concerns."
30:38;30:41;"But there's a big song in the '60s, an early hit"
30:41;30:43;"written by Carole King before her solo career."
30:43;30:44;"You know what I'm talking about?"
30:44;30:47;"I'm blanking, but I will when you say it."
30:47;30:48;"Oh, will you love me?"
30:48;30:50;"Will you still love me tomorrow?"
30:50;30:52;"That entire song is about like, I'm"
30:52;30:54;"ready to engage in sexual activity with you."
30:54;30:55;"Tonight."
30:55;30:56;"Yeah."
30:56;30:59;"Tonight's the night."
30:59;31:01;"There's some great lines in it."
31:01;31:04;"Will I do?"
31:04;31:05;"That song is incredible."
31:05;31:07;"Let's check out the lyrics, because I think--"
31:07;31:08;"OK."
31:08;31:10;"Tonight you're mine completely."
31:10;31:11;"You give your love so sweetly."
31:11;31:16;"Tonight the light of love is in your eyes."
31:16;31:17;"Great melody."
31:17;31:21;"Will you still love me tomorrow?"
31:21;31:23;"This is where the second verse really gets into it."
31:23;31:26;"Is this a lasting treasure?"
31:26;31:28;"Bom, bom, bom, bom."
31:28;31:31;"Or just a moment's pleasure?"
31:31;31:36;"Can I believe the magic of your sighs?"
31:36;31:39;"Will you still love me tomorrow?"
31:39;31:43;"Is this a lasting treasure or just a moment's pleasure?"
31:43;31:47;"I'd like to complicate that binary."
31:47;31:48;"You're exhausted?"
31:48;31:49;"No, no, I'm in."
31:49;31:51;"I'm just saying like, that's the question"
31:51;31:54;"through most of life, is something"
31:54;31:57;"that happens a lasting treasure or just a moment's pleasure?"
31:57;31:59;"Why can't it be both?"
31:59;32:01;"And I'm not just talking about sexual activity."
32:01;32:03;"Magical things happen in life."
32:03;32:06;"And we're kind of taught that if it's a one-off,"
32:06;32:07;"it's less meaningful."
32:07;32:08;"Right."
32:08;32:10;"Isn't that a problem as we go through life?"
32:10;32:10;"Yeah."
32:10;32:11;"Live in the moment."
32:11;32:14;"Something good happens, a good moment happens."
32:14;32:16;"Ideally, it'll bring you pleasure"
32:16;32:18;"for the rest of your life, as long as you're not"
32:18;32:20;"like betting the farm on it."
32:20;32:22;"Beats one."

32:30;32:32;"Back to '06."
32:32;32:33;"I guess '06, there was a lot of--"
32:33;32:34;"Well done."
32:34;32:36;"--pretty sexual year, if we look back through it."
32:36;32:37;"Pretty sexual summer."
32:37;32:38;"Although, I do--"
32:38;32:40;"Pretty sexual summer?"
32:40;32:42;"2006, man."
32:42;32:45;"That was a sexual summer."
32:45;32:46;"Let's take it back to '96."
32:46;32:47;"OK."
32:47;32:48;"1996."
32:48;32:51;"So 1996, I was 12 years old, man."
32:51;32:52;"I was just a kid."
32:52;32:53;"I don't know what I was doing that summer."
32:53;32:54;"I was probably, you know--"
32:54;32:56;"I was probably in New Jersey, just"
32:56;33:01;"hanging out with friends, walking around the suburbs,"
33:01;33:02;"seeing movies."
33:02;33:03;"Or maybe I was at summer camp."
33:03;33:05;"I went to summer camp a couple summers as a youth."
33:05;33:06;"Oh."
33:06;33:07;"In Connecticut."
33:07;33:08;"Oh."
33:08;33:10;"I was in Connecticut in '96, too."
33:10;33:11;"Oh, really?"
33:11;33:14;"Working a landscaping gig."
33:14;33:16;"It was after my freshman year of college, so I was 19."
33:16;33:17;"So you went-- so you--"
33:17;33:19;"freshman year of college, you go back home."
33:19;33:20;"Yeah."
33:20;33:21;"Still hanging out with the high school crew."
33:21;33:23;"Yep."
33:23;33:24;"I was doing a landscaping gig at this mansion."
33:24;33:25;"Really?"
33:25;33:26;"Yeah."
33:26;33:28;"Like, you just landscaped one mansion all summer?"
33:28;33:29;"Yep."
33:29;33:31;"Yep, they had a full-time landscaper,"
33:31;33:32;"or groundskeeper."
33:32;33:33;"This guy named Fabio."
33:33;33:34;"He's Portuguese."
33:34;33:36;"And then he hired--"
33:36;33:37;"he hired two people."
33:37;33:38;"So I was one of two assistants."
33:38;33:41;"Were you doing, like, a lot of shoveling?"
33:41;33:43;"Yeah, we were planting a huge hedge, as I remember."
33:43;33:45;"Yeah."
33:45;33:47;"There was a lot of, like, acres of mowing to do,"
33:47;33:51;"leaf blowing the tennis court, cleaning the pool."
33:51;33:54;"But they were doing, like, a major garden renovation."
33:54;33:55;"What kind of hat would you wear?"
33:55;33:58;"Would you wear, like, a really big sun hat to cover yourself?"
33:58;34:00;"Or you wearing a baseball cap or nothing?"
34:00;34:02;"Yeah, either nothing or a baseball hat."
34:02;34:05;"Also recorded an album that summer with Dave, my brother."
34:05;34:05;"Oh, really?"
34:05;34:06;"Yeah."
34:06;34:07;"I've got to hear that."
34:07;34:08;"American People."
34:08;34:10;"Wait, was that the name of the band?"
34:10;34:11;"Yeah, we made, like, five albums."
34:11;34:12;"Really?"
34:12;34:13;"You and Dave made five albums?"
34:13;34:14;"There's going to be a box set someday."
34:14;34:16;"Oh, I don't know if I've ever heard any of that."
34:16;34:17;"It's tight."
34:17;34:17;"Really?"
34:17;34:18;"Yeah."
34:18;34:19;"We should throw some of that up on the internet."
34:19;34:20;"Love to."
34:20;34:23;"So let's get into the big music of '96."
34:23;34:25;"Let's see how it compares to 2006,"
34:25;34:28;"as we delve further and further into the past."
34:28;34:29;"Prediction?"
34:29;34:30;"Yeah."
34:30;34:31;"This is going to sound a lot different than--"
34:31;34:34;"so '06, 2016, we were sort of confused."
34:34;34:35;"Like, is this even that different?"
34:35;34:36;"Right."
34:36;34:37;"'96 is going to be, like, third eye blind."
34:37;34:39;"It's going to sound way different."
34:39;34:40;"We'll see."
34:40;34:44;"1996, this is Tupac with KC and JoJo, ""How Do You Want It?"""
34:44;34:47;"[music - ""how do you want it""]"
34:47;34:49;"(SINGING) How do you want it?"
34:49;34:51;"How did you feel?"
34:51;34:53;"Coming up as a nickname in a catch game"
34:53;34:57;"and in a fast lane, I believe."
34:57;34:59;"How do you want it?"
34:59;35:00;"I wonder if--"
35:00;35:01;"When did Tupac die?"
35:01;35:01;"'96?"
35:01;35:03;"I think he died in '96."
35:03;35:07;"I think Biggie and Tupac died in '96, right?"
35:07;35:09;"Dude, I saw Biggie play a show in '96."
35:09;35:10;"Really?"
35:10;35:11;"Yeah, at UConn."
35:11;35:12;"You saw Biggie live?"
35:12;35:12;"Yeah."
35:12;35:13;"In Connecticut?"
35:13;35:15;"Yeah, I went back for the said landscaping gig."
35:15;35:16;"Yeah."
35:16;35:18;"And then my friend John Joyce was like, hey, dude,"
35:18;35:22;"Violent Femmes and Notorious B.I.G. are playing at UConn."
35:22;35:24;"Violent Femmes and Notorious B.I.G.?"
35:24;35:25;"Yeah."
35:25;35:28;"Oh, so Tupac died September 13, '96."
35:28;35:29;"OK."
35:29;35:33;"So he had a big song on the radio the summer before he died."
35:33;35:34;"Yeah."

36:36;36:39;"I mean, this is like not an original observation,"
36:39;36:41;"but those guys were so young."
36:41;36:43;"Yeah, like what, 24 or something?"
36:43;36:44;"Yeah, mid-20s."
36:44;36:46;"Casey and JoJo are still around."

36:52;36:54;"Yeah."
36:54;36:56;"So yeah, that sounds like a long time ago."
36:56;36:57;"How about this?"
36:57;37:00;"Also '96, summer '96."
37:00;37:03;"[music - ""how do you want it""]"
37:03;37:05;"You know, I had no idea when this song was from."
37:05;37:06;"It's such a timeless song."
37:06;37:07;"Is this Tracey Chabin?"
37:07;37:08;"Yeah."
37:08;37:10;"So she came out in the '80s, like ""Fast Cars"""
37:10;37:11;"from the '80s."
37:11;37:11;"Is it?"
37:11;37:13;"Yeah."
37:13;37:15;"This is gnarly."
37:15;37:16;"Really?"
37:16;37:17;"This seems right up your alley, man."
37:17;37:21;"I'm not into, like, bluesy coffee shop."
37:21;37:24;"Although I like this patient intro."
37:24;37:24;"Yeah, man."
37:24;37:26;"Almost no vocals."
37:26;37:27;"We're at the 30-second mark."
37:27;37:30;"Just like guitar."
37:30;37:36;"[music - ""how do you want it""]"

37:39;37:40;"I'm in."

37:46;37:48;"Tracey Chabin wrote a lot of good songs,"
37:48;37:51;"but two just, like, bonafide classics."
37:51;37:55;"""Fast Car"" and ""Give Me One Reason."""
37:55;37:56;"This feels like one of those songs"
37:56;37:58;"that she just sat down and grabbed the guitar"
37:58;37:59;"and just, like, poured out of her."
37:59;38:01;"Yeah."
38:01;38:04;"[music - ""how do you want it""]"
38:04;38:05;"Don't need those drums."

38:51;38:53;"This song is kind of like--"
38:53;38:55;"I mean, they're both just, like, kind of blues tropes."
38:55;38:57;"Yeah."
38:57;38:58;"But this song's kind of like the--"
38:58;39:00;"it's very similar, actually, to, like,"
39:00;39:03;"(SINGING) should I stay or should I go?"
39:03;39:05;"So you got to let me know."
39:05;39:09;"Should I-- should I cool it or should I blow?"

39:11;39:13;"This is kind of like a more elegant version of should"
39:13;39:14;"I stay or should I go?"
39:14;39:15;"Yeah."
39:15;39:17;"Like, should I stay or should I go is, like, very, like--"
39:17;39:19;"like, just kind of punky British, you know, like,"
39:19;39:20;"the clash, like--"
39:20;39:21;"Very stiff."
39:21;39:23;"(SINGING) Should I stay or should I go?"
39:23;39:25;"And this is like--"
39:25;39:28;"(SINGING) Give me one reason to stay here."
39:28;39:30;"This is, like, a lot more elegant and subtle."
39:30;39:31;"I mean, they're both good songs."
39:31;39:32;"Whatever."
39:32;39:37;"[music - ""how do you want it""]"
39:37;39:38;"Give me one reason to stay here,"

39:41;39:42;"Yeah."
39:42;39:44;"But she doesn't want to go."
39:44;39:46;"Yeah, you're looking for--"
39:46;39:49;"I think a lot of times in life--"
39:49;39:50;"[laughs]"
39:50;39:51;"Going to turn this into a life lesson?"
39:51;39:53;"Uncle Ezra."
39:53;39:55;"A lot of times in life, man, you--"
39:55;40:00;"you know we're social animals."
40:00;40:01;"You know what I mean?"
40:01;40:02;"Human beings are social--"
40:02;40:04;"social beasts."
40:04;40:05;"Yeah."
40:05;40:09;"We rely on other people, a sense of community."
40:09;40:11;"We don't like to just make decisions"
40:11;40:13;"built on self-interest."
40:13;40:16;"But sometimes you just need that one reason."
40:16;40:19;"You want to show compassion to another person,"
40:19;40:21;"but they're giving you all the wrong signs."
40:21;40:23;"Give me one reason, man."
40:23;40:25;"Just one reason."
40:25;40:28;"One reason to stay here."
40:28;40:29;"It's a modest request."

40:34;40:36;"Give me one reason to stay here."
40:36;40:40;"Oh, I'd turn right back around."

41:01;41:04;"Baby, just give me one reason."
41:04;41:09;"Oh, give me just one reason why I should stay."
41:09;41:13;"Said I told you that I loved you."
41:13;41:15;"And there ain't no more to say."
41:15;41:17;"You can go either way, too, because you can--"
41:17;41:22;"you can ask to get-- to get one reason to be the larger person."
41:22;41:23;"Right."
41:23;41:24;"And look past things."
41:24;41:25;"Yeah."
41:25;41:26;"Or it could be like Joe Pesci style,"
41:26;41:29;"give me one reason why I shouldn't--"
41:29;41:30;"Right, right."
41:30;41:31;"Give me one--"
41:31;41:34;"Give me one damn reason."
41:34;41:35;"Why I shouldn't just--"

41:42;41:43;"[music - ""judge me""]"
41:43;41:44;"Oh, yeah."
41:44;41:48;"Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom."
41:48;41:51;"Tell me what you're going to do when it ain't nowhere to run."
41:51;41:53;"Judge me 'cause for you."
41:53;41:54;"Judge me 'cause for you."

41:59;42:01;"'Cause it's going to come to you."
42:01;42:02;"Yeah, so I'm singing this for fun."
42:02;42:04;"It's easy to see something's trying to--"
42:04;42:06;"Such an original style, I was just going to say."
42:06;42:07;"So it does."
42:07;42:08;"--miss everybody."
42:08;42:11;"I don't know if I'm going to miss everybody."
42:11;42:12;"This is a huge song in the '90s."
42:12;42:13;"Yeah."
42:13;42:14;"--too deep to be sad."
42:14;42:16;"But at least I got you big."
42:16;42:18;"Tell me you're peachy, but she's a pretty peach."
42:18;42:19;"Make me pay by my grand, grand."
42:19;42:20;"You're one of your kind."
42:20;42:21;"This is a song about loss."
42:21;42:23;"She working on a plan to heaven."
42:23;42:24;"Talking about different people who died."
42:24;42:26;"Got a silver grade."
42:26;42:27;"Even though the devil's all up in my face."
42:28;42:29;"But he keeping me safe, hidden in my place."
42:29;42:31;"Say thanks to the gangsta race when I changed the face."
42:31;42:34;"Now, what is ""The Crossroads"" actually referred to?"
42:34;42:36;"Because heaven?"
42:36;42:38;"I think so."
42:38;42:40;"Because it's interesting, because the other famous"
42:40;42:42;"""Crossroads"" song is--"
42:42;42:43;"Robert Johnson."
42:43;42:44;"--Robert Johnson."
42:44;42:46;"And Robert Johnson's ""Crossroads,"" his old blues"
42:46;42:49;"song, was he met the devil at the crossroads."
42:49;42:52;"Right."
42:52;42:55;"That's where Eric Clapton sold his soul."
42:55;42:57;"Eric Clapton met the devil."
42:57;43:00;"Jimmy Page."
43:00;43:01;"Right, that's interesting."
43:01;43:03;"Yeah, so is ""The Crossroads"" heaven or--"
43:03;43:04;"I think hell."
43:04;43:06;"In this case, it's heaven."
43:06;43:08;"I guess ""The Crossroads"" refers to an intersection."
43:08;43:10;"[MUSIC - THE CROSSROADS, ""HEAVEN""]"
43:10;43:12;"So that I know I'm going to meet you up at the crossroads."
43:12;43:14;"You'll know if I ever got love in them both."
43:14;43:16;"I'm spending the evening on the ground."
43:16;43:17;"Really wishing to come home."
43:17;43:19;"But when it's time to die, I got to go bye-bye."
43:19;43:21;"All I look up to do is cry."
43:21;43:22;"Cry."
43:22;43:23;"Why'd I kill my dog?"
43:23;43:24;"Damn, man, I miss my man."
43:24;43:27;"That's named after a crossroads in Cleveland."
43:27;43:30;"There's a literal local reference,"
43:30;43:33;"but obviously it takes a metaphorical resonance"
43:33;43:35;"as well."
43:35;43:37;"I mean, ""The Crossroads"" is a--"
43:37;43:38;"I mean, also in life."
43:38;43:39;"Yeah."
43:39;43:41;"You come to a crossroads."
43:41;43:43;"See you at the crossroads."
43:43;43:44;"It's a beautiful song."
43:44;43:45;"Yeah."
43:45;43:47;"And again, such an original band."
43:47;43:49;"I just see you at the crossroads."
43:49;43:51;"You know I'm gonna follow you."
43:51;43:53;"See you at the crossroads."
43:53;43:55;"You know I'm gonna follow you."
43:55;43:57;"See you at the crossroads."

44:03;44:05;"And I'm gonna miss everybody."
44:15;44:16;"Living in a hateful world."
44:16;44:17;"Send 'em a straight to hell."

44:24;44:26;"And I'm asking a good lord why you sighing."
44:26;44:27;"He told me we live to die."
44:27;44:28;"Well somebody run around."
44:28;44:29;"See my nigga cousin was hound."
44:29;44:30;"Somebody run around."
44:30;44:32;"Everybody wanna test us out."
44:32;44:34;"And this sneeze is to the ease of the fount."
44:34;44:36;"And nobody's sending me 'cause he ain't turning on me."
44:36;44:37;"They didn't want to leave."
44:37;44:38;"But they come again."
44:38;44:39;"Again and again."
44:39;44:41;"They tell me what you gonna do."

44:58;44:59;"Innocent?"
44:59;45:01;"Maybe innocent."
45:01;45:04;"The height of the Clinton years."

49:15;49:25;"♪"
49:25;49:38;"♪"
49:38;49:40;"This was like you're watching a Yankees game,"

49:42;49:44;"in Kansas City,"
49:44;49:47;"and then they're playing this during the seventh inning stretch,"
49:47;49:50;"and the camera's panning around the stadium."
49:50;49:54;"So Los Del Rio are actually from Spain."
49:54;49:58;"Macarena is a dance a lot of people did in the '90s."
49:58;50:03;"Fun fact, Macarena is about a woman named Macarena."
50:03;50:07;"That must have been kind of weird if your name was Macarena back in '96."
50:07;50:09;"Oh my God, going to work."
50:09;50:12;"It is kind of a nice name if you can forget about this."
50:12;50:15;"People got very annoyed by that song because it was so huge after a while."
50:15;50:18;"And it smacks of like ethnic novelty song."
50:18;50:20;"It's just like, eh."
50:20;50:22;"So what?"
50:22;50:25;"No one was like, ""That song is so awesome."""
50:25;50:27;"Well, it's because it's a--"
50:27;50:30;"Any song that people primarily know for the dance,"
50:30;50:34;"people are not going to give it props for like being deep."
50:34;50:36;"But that's on them if they want to say"
50:36;50:38;"that the body and the mind are not connected."
50:38;50:40;"I don't subscribe to that. Far from it."
50:40;50:42;"So that was '96."
50:42;50:45;"I don't know if it's like some Stephen Hawking thing,"
50:45;50:49;"but as we dig deeper into the past, I feel a sense of exhaustion."

51:05;51:07;"'86 is going to be weird."
51:07;51:09;"Are you ready for '86?"
51:09;51:11;"Also, it was like, okay--"
51:11;51:13;"- Summer '86. - We're doing summer songs."
51:13;51:15;"You know, like the summer jams kind of thing?"
51:15;51:17;"There's a difference between summer jams"
51:17;51:19;"and then like a song that was just a hit,"
51:19;51:21;"incidentally, during the summer."
51:21;51:24;"And I feel like in '86, we're going to get some like--"
51:24;51:26;"I don't know, some white snake or something."
51:26;51:29;"- It's just going to be like-- - So you're differentiating between--"
51:29;51:31;"Look, if a song's a hit, right,"
51:31;51:33;"because if a song's a hit in the summer,"
51:33;51:36;"what people call a summer hit has to be like kind of fun."
51:36;51:38;"Like Macarena is a summer hit for sure."
51:38;51:41;"Like even if there was-- it has to be fun and light."
51:41;51:44;"I don't know why that Tony Braxton song was a summer hit."
51:44;51:46;"It was just a big-- it was popular in the summer."
51:46;51:48;"- I get it. - Right, because like--"
51:48;51:51;"when people talk about the song of the summer,"
51:51;51:53;"they're not going to pick like an Adele ballad,"
51:53;51:56;"even if that is one of the biggest songs of the summer."
51:56;51:58;"A summer song has to be kind of fun,"
51:58;52:00;"maybe a little sexy."
52:00;52:03;"Yeah. I'm picturing '86-- '86 is going to be weird."
52:03;52:06;"- It will be. - So I was nine."
52:06;52:08;"- You were nine? - And you were two."
52:08;52:10;"I was two. I was a baby."
52:10;52:13;"My family's maybe just moving to New Jersey."
52:13;52:15;"- I remember '86. - I have no memories of it."
52:15;52:18;"Mets, huge series, crazy series."
52:18;52:20;"Wait, is that when they beat the Red Sox?"
52:20;52:23;"- The Red Sox. Yeah. Game six, that was the--"
52:23;52:25;"- Bill Buckner? - Exactly. Epic."
52:25;52:28;"- Were you a Mets fan? - Yeah, I was a baseball fan."
52:28;52:30;"I was a New York baseball fan."
52:30;52:32;"When you're nine, you know, it's a little more fluid."
52:32;52:34;"Yankees, Mets."
52:34;52:38;"It's so weird to me that, like, kids are into sport--"
52:38;52:40;"I mean, maybe I just don't relate to it"
52:40;52:42;"'cause I wasn't raised with sports."
52:42;52:44;"I feel like when you're nine-- when I think of baseball,"
52:44;52:46;"I just think of, like, stats and stuff."
52:46;52:48;"So it's like when I picture, like, a nine-year-old kid"
52:48;52:50;"being into baseball, there's just, like, something funny"
52:50;52:53;"about, like, a nine-year-old kid thinking about, like,"
52:53;52:56;"- RBIs and, like, the lineup and, like-- - Yeah."
52:56;52:58;"- He drove it 145 runs, dude. - Yeah."
52:58;53:00;"His slugging percentage was, like, 550 or something."
53:00;53:02;"Like, baseball's so complicated in a way"
53:02;53:04;"that even just, like, a nine-year-old--"
53:04;53:06;"nine-year-old kids, I can understand being into superheroes."
53:06;53:08;"I mean, I respect it."
53:08;53:10;"Like, all respect to nine-year-old kids who are--"
53:10;53:13;"Slugging percentage is total bases divided by at-bats."
53:13;53:14;"( laughing )"
53:14;53:16;"That's weird."
53:16;53:20;"So this song was big in summer of '86."
53:20;53:22;"- Genesis. - Nice."
53:22;53:24;"""Invisible Touch."""

01:08:07;01:08:08;"Now, this one's interesting."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"Okay."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"Because the number one song"
01:08:10;01:08:13;"of summer '86 actually kind of holds up"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"'cause it was pushing back a little bit"
01:08:15;01:08:16;"on cultural norms."
01:08:16;01:08:17;"This was an artist"
01:08:17;01:08:19;"who's still doing her thing today."
01:08:19;01:08:21;"So in 1986, this was a song"
01:08:21;01:08:24;"that the Peter Cetera feels, like, so dated."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"He was singing about the glory of love,"
01:08:26;01:08:27;"whereas some--"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"she was kind of singing the opposite."
01:08:29;01:08:32;"( music playing )"
01:08:32;01:08:41;"I don't know about this intro."
01:08:41;01:08:42;"I forgot about it."
01:08:42;01:08:45;"( music playing )"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"Does this pop about preach?"
01:08:48;01:08:49;"Yeah, nice."
01:08:49;01:08:51;"Music's very '80s."
01:08:51;01:08:54;"( music playing )"
01:08:54;01:08:57;"Is that a--"
01:08:57;01:08:59;"Is someone playing that bass?"
01:08:59;01:09:01;"Sounds like a keyboard."

01:10:04;01:10:06;"Is the baby-- is she pregnant?"
01:10:06;01:10:07;"Or she's talking about, like, her baby that--"
01:10:07;01:10:09;"- She's pregnant. - Okay."
01:10:09;01:10:10;"All right."
01:10:10;01:10:12;"Wow, so--okay."
01:10:12;01:10:13;"Just wow."
01:10:13;01:10:15;"So basically everything that we're saying"
01:10:15;01:10:18;"about, like, what's corny about the Peter Cetera song,"
01:10:18;01:10:19;"just, like, 1986,"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"kind of just, like, head in the sand vibe."
01:10:21;01:10:23;"- Yeah. - Just, like, having these trite--"
01:10:23;01:10:24;"I mean, it is a great song."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"I really hate to diss Peter Cetera."
01:10:26;01:10:28;"He's a legend, but, you know, just on a cultural level,"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"this, like, song-- it kind of feels funny."
01:10:30;01:10:33;"Like, 1986, America's falling apart."
01:10:33;01:10:36;"You got this, like, gnarly president"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"who's kind of preaching one thing"
01:10:38;01:10:41;"and then literally, like, supporting death squads"
01:10:41;01:10:42;"in Latin America."
01:10:42;01:10:45;"Like, you know, Reagan was up to some real gnarly stuff."
01:10:45;01:10:48;"So Peter Cetera is singing these very trite sentiments"
01:10:48;01:10:50;"about glory, living forever,"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"and Madonna's basically saying,"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"""I've got a real problem here."""
01:10:54;01:10:56;"- She's a realist. - Yeah, she's a realist."
01:10:56;01:10:59;"Like, and shout-out to Madonna, because, like, people kind of--"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"I feel like there's more and more Madonna hate these days,"
01:11:01;01:11:02;"but she really did her thing."
01:11:02;01:11:04;"So Madonna's saying, like, ""Hey, guys,"
01:11:04;01:11:07;"""I'm not interested in these giant narratives"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"""about eternal love or whatever."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"""I got a real problem."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"""I'm pregnant, it's with a guy I love,"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"""and guess what, father figure?"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"""I know you didn't like him, but guess what?"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"""He's here, and he impregnated your daughter."
01:11:18;01:11:21;"""So can you just, like, shut the f-- up for a second and help me?"""
01:11:21;01:11:23;"- Get on board, dog. - Get on board."
01:11:23;01:11:25;"This is happening. We're in the real world."
01:11:25;01:11:27;"Hey, Dad, I believe in the video"
01:11:27;01:11:29;"her dad was played by Dani Aiello."
01:11:29;01:11:31;"I was picturing Dani Aiello, and I was--"
01:11:31;01:11:34;"in my head, I was like, ""Is this from a movie, or what?"""
01:11:34;01:11:37;"Am I just the closet Dani Aiello had?"
01:11:37;01:11:40;"So it's basically like, ""Hey, Mr. Aiello,"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"""you know, I wish I could have had a white wedding."
01:11:42;01:11:44;"""I wish that I could have, um,"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"""have eternal love with somebody that you love,"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"""but guess what? Things are messed up."""
01:11:48;01:11:49;"- Life's messy. - Life's messy,"
01:11:49;01:11:51;"and we just gotta make the best of it."
01:11:51;01:11:53;"So actually, I really like that"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"after our kind of dark interpretation"
01:11:55;01:11:57;"- of Summer '86... - Yeah."
01:11:57;01:11:59;"...that-- I'm glad that the number one song"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"was kind of, like, pushing back"
01:12:01;01:12:03;"against a conservative father figure."
01:12:03;01:12:05;"- How about that? How about that? - She was--"
01:12:05;01:12:07;"- She was the postmodern realist. - Yeah."
01:12:07;01:12:10;"You literally have this, like, conservative father figure"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"lying to the country, Reagan,"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"supporting death squads,"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"flooding the hood with crack,"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"and that's-- that's not a conspiracy theory."
01:12:18;01:12:20;"- That's real. - And you have a rock star"
01:12:20;01:12:23;"from the '70s in his later years"
01:12:23;01:12:26;"writing power ballads for a Hollywood sequel."
01:12:26;01:12:29;"Yeah. No wonder Madonna said, ""The world on fire."""
01:12:29;01:12:31;"- She crushed him. - ""Papa, don't preach."""
01:12:31;01:12:33;"That's what this show's all about, man."
01:12:33;01:12:35;"It's when we find those moments"
01:12:35;01:12:38;"when the charts reflected the will of the people."
01:12:38;01:12:40;"That Madonna song sounded great."
01:12:40;01:12:42;"- I haven't heard that in years. - Yeah."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"I was, like, captivated by that song."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"And you're really, like, following the story."
01:12:46;01:12:48;"- Yeah. - I'm not like a--"
01:12:48;01:12:50;"I'm not like a ride-or-die Madonna person at all."
01:12:50;01:12:53;"- Absolutely not. - Like, she's got a lot of great songs,"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"but it's like, man, I like that."
01:12:55;01:12:57;"1986, ""Papa, don't preach."" Number one."
01:12:57;01:12:59;"- Is that the-- is that the True Blue album? - Yeah."
01:12:59;01:13:01;"So that has ""Open Your Heart."""
01:13:01;01:13:03;"That has, like, a lot of huge hits on there."
01:13:03;01:13:05;"Massive. She was killing it."
01:13:05;01:13:07;"Shout-out to you, Madonna. 1986."
01:13:07;01:13:09;"So we just went through, uh--"
01:13:09;01:13:11;"we kind of went back in time four decades."
01:13:11;01:13:13;"- Three decades. - Yeah."
01:13:13;01:13:15;"- Yeah, man. - Can split it as here?"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"Three to four decades."
01:13:17;01:13:20;"Yeah, you're right. 2006, '96, '86."
01:13:20;01:13:23;"I gotta say, um, maybe it's natural."
01:13:23;01:13:25;"You go back ten years, and you're kind of like,"
01:13:25;01:13:27;"""Oh, wait, this was ten years ago. Weird."""
01:13:27;01:13:29;"You go back 20 years--"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"go back 30 years."
01:13:31;01:13:33;"That's when you really, like, find the story."
01:13:33;01:13:35;"Hindsight's 20/20, what can I say?"
01:13:35;01:13:37;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:13:37;01:13:39;"So speaking of 1986,"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"that was a big year for rap."
01:13:41;01:13:43;"An early, massive hip-hop album,"
01:13:43;01:13:45;"the debut album by the Beastie Boys,"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"came out in 1986."
01:13:47;01:13:49;"I don't want to play a song from that."
01:13:49;01:13:51;"- Not debut, bro. - Yeah."
01:13:51;01:13:53;"- Really? - Yeah, man."
01:13:53;01:13:55;"Not that Paul's Boutique-- wait. Okay, my bad."
01:13:55;01:13:57;"- Took up that segment. - ( laughs )"
01:13:57;01:13:59;"I'm a little bit of a talker that I'm not a aficionado"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"on hip-hop history."
01:14:01;01:14:03;"So one member of this group, the Beastie Boys,"
01:14:03;01:14:06;"Mike D just started doing his own show,"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"Echo Chamber, on Beats 1."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"I was on his first show on Friday,"
01:14:10;01:14:13;"and, um, took a little bit of, uh,"
01:14:13;01:14:15;"our conversation back to time crisis."
01:14:15;01:14:18;"So we're gonna listen to the Beastie Boys,"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"and then you'll hear some of my conversation"

01:30:15;01:30:16;"Very cool."
01:30:16;01:30:17;"All right."
01:30:17;01:30:20;"We've been digging in the crates a lot in this episode,"
01:30:20;01:30:23;"learning about the summer hits of years past,"
01:30:23;01:30:27;"but that was all in preparation for the top five."
01:30:27;01:30:30;"It's time for the top five."
01:30:30;01:30:34;"Five on iTunes."
01:30:34;01:30:40;"So as we did on the last proper episode of Time Crisis,"
01:30:40;01:30:45;"we've been comparing the top five hits of our era,"
01:30:45;01:30:48;"summer 2016, with what was going on back"
01:30:48;01:30:51;"in another tumultuous era, 1968."
01:30:51;01:30:54;"Obviously, 2016 and 1968 have been compared a lot."
01:30:54;01:31:00;"Political unrest, racism, brutality, election years."
01:31:00;01:31:04;"So, you know, we got the conventions coming up."
01:31:04;01:31:07;"Hopefully nothing as violent as what happened in 1968 happens."
01:31:07;01:31:10;"But obviously, people are angry."
01:31:10;01:31:14;"So we're going to start out with the number five song"
01:31:14;01:31:18;"of this moment in 1968, and we're going to compare it to 2016."
01:31:18;01:31:20;"See if we can learn anything,"
01:31:20;01:31:22;"because you know what they say about history."
01:31:22;01:31:23;"It repeats itself."
01:31:23;01:31:26;"I don't know if they say that, but they say"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"if you don't take a good hard look at it..."
01:31:28;01:31:29;"You're doomed to repeat it."
01:31:29;01:31:31;"You're doomed to repeat it."
01:31:31;01:31:34;"Although, truthfully, you're doomed to repeat it no matter what."
01:31:34;01:31:36;"The more things change."
01:31:36;01:31:37;"Exactly."
01:31:37;01:31:41;"The number five song in 1968 was by Hugh Masekela,"
01:31:41;01:31:44;"who I believe at that time was in exile"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"from apartheid South Africa."
01:31:46;01:31:48;"He's a black man from South Africa."
01:31:48;01:31:49;"Wow."
01:31:49;01:31:51;"So this is the height of apartheid,"
01:31:51;01:31:54;"or 1960s South Africa,"
01:31:54;01:31:57;"the black people having extremely limited rights,"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"being brutalized."
01:31:59;01:32:02;"So he and a lot of other South African musicians"
01:32:02;01:32:05;"got out of there to kind of live their life,"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"and he made this song, an instrumental"
01:32:07;01:32:10;"that became an international hit, ""Grazing in the Grass."""
01:32:10;01:32:12;"( music playing )"

01:32:56;01:32:57;"Very summery."

01:37:24;01:37:26;"in Buddhism my whole life."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"Yeah."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"It's well-known in the community."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"But, you know, like, whatever."
01:37:30;01:37:32;"Studied it, been around it."
01:37:32;01:37:33;"And there was this book I had"
01:37:33;01:37:35;"when I was a kid that my mom gave me"
01:37:35;01:37:36;"that was these little cartoons"
01:37:36;01:37:37;"about Zen Buddhism."
01:37:37;01:37:38;"It was always interesting to me"
01:37:38;01:37:39;"because it was always--"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"it was these kind of strange stories"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"explaining how different monks"
01:37:43;01:37:44;"became enlightened."
01:37:44;01:37:45;"Mm."
01:37:45;01:37:46;"You know, if it was easy"
01:37:46;01:37:47;"to become enlightened,"
01:37:47;01:37:48;"we'd all just get enlightened."
01:37:48;01:37:50;"So it's, like, these very difficult"
01:37:50;01:37:51;"to understand stories"
01:37:51;01:37:52;"about how a certain--"
01:37:52;01:37:53;"something that somebody said"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"or a certain unusual circumstance,"
01:37:55;01:37:57;"these guys finally achieved enlightenment."
01:37:57;01:37:58;"So my whole life,"
01:37:58;01:37:59;"because these cartoons"
01:37:59;01:38:00;"made a big impression on me,"
01:38:00;01:38:01;"I always kind of wondered,"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"when will I be enlightened?"
01:38:03;01:38:04;"Is it gonna happen for me?"
01:38:04;01:38:05;"I don't know."
01:38:05;01:38:06;"And then--so then there's times"
01:38:06;01:38:08;"in my life where I really start"
01:38:08;01:38:10;"to try to understand"
01:38:10;01:38:11;"the teachings of Buddhism"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"or, you know, all religions, really."
01:38:13;01:38:14;"They're all kind of saying"
01:38:14;01:38:15;"the same thing."
01:38:15;01:38:16;"And so I'm wondering,"
01:38:16;01:38:17;"how will I know"
01:38:17;01:38:18;"when I achieved enlightenment,"
01:38:18;01:38:20;"when I truly became--"
01:38:20;01:38:21;"ascended to this level"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"of understanding and compassion?"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"And the funny thing is, like,"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"there are times where you kind of"
01:38:27;01:38:28;"embrace these philosophies"
01:38:28;01:38:29;"and you think,"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"""Whoa, maybe I'm finally enlightened."""
01:38:31;01:38:32;"Oftentimes, the first thing"
01:38:32;01:38:34;"you think is, ""And you know what?"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"""I'm definitely a lot more enlightened"

01:38:39;01:38:40;"It's like just when you think"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"that you cracked the code, man,"
01:38:42;01:38:43;"when you're kind of like--"
01:38:43;01:38:44;"it's kind of like, you know,"
01:38:44;01:38:46;"these days everybody talks about,"
01:38:46;01:38:47;"like, being woke,"
01:38:47;01:38:48;"and it's very important"
01:38:48;01:38:49;"to kind of understand"
01:38:49;01:38:51;"the hatred and the racism"
01:38:51;01:38:52;"and the sexism"
01:38:52;01:38:53;"that drives our world."
01:38:53;01:38:55;"And sometimes you start reading"
01:38:55;01:38:56;"about these things"
01:38:56;01:38:57;"and you feel like"
01:38:57;01:38:59;"you finally understand it."
01:38:59;01:39:01;"And if your first impulse"
01:39:01;01:39:03;"is to use that"
01:39:03;01:39:05;"as, like, a tool of ego--"
01:39:05;01:39:06;"- To compare yourself."
01:39:06;01:39:07;"- To compare yourself,"
01:39:07;01:39:08;"you've only learned"

01:39:09;01:39:10;"- Right."
01:39:10;01:39:11;"- I mean, and it's something"
01:39:11;01:39:12;"we all have to work on,"
01:39:12;01:39:13;"but I'm not saying it's easy,"

01:39:43;01:39:44;"Yeah, I guess the Buddhist point"

01:39:59;01:40:00;"of Meghan Trainor."

01:40:17;01:40:20;"saying something very egotistical,"

01:47:54;01:47:58;"""21 Pilots"" have an unusual lyrical perspective"
01:47:58;01:48:00;"that you're not seeing a lot in the top five."

01:48:01;01:48:02;"- There's been a lot of great music,"

01:48:33;01:48:35;"that ""21 Pilots"" song?"
01:48:35;01:48:36;"- They're the rare, like, band..."
01:48:36;01:48:37;"- Yeah."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"- That's also getting played on pop radio."
01:48:39;01:48:42;"- I don't even have a handle on pop radio."
01:48:42;01:48:44;"It seems like the radio stations"
01:48:44;01:48:47;"have become very segregated."
01:48:47;01:48:49;"- Yes, there's not a lot of that--"
01:48:49;01:48:51;"that alternative pop crossover"
01:48:51;01:48:52;"like there was in the '90s."
01:48:52;01:48:54;"""21 Pilots"" are changing that, though."
01:48:54;01:48:55;"Shout-out to them."
01:48:55;01:48:57;"So let's head back to 1968."
01:48:57;01:48:59;"I should point out to the listeners"
01:48:59;01:49:01;"that, um, I got hungry,"
01:49:01;01:49:04;"so I'm eating some, uh, Cool Ranch Doritos."
01:49:04;01:49:06;"Uh, I'm--offer some to Jake,"

01:49:09;01:49:10;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:49:10;01:49:12;"- It's weirdly serendipitous."
01:49:12;01:49:13;"Doritos were introduced"
01:49:13;01:49:15;"onto the national market in 1968."
01:49:15;01:49:16;"- Really?"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"- Yeah, they were invented in '66."
01:49:18;01:49:21;"They were actually invented at Disneyland,"
01:49:21;01:49:23;"and there was a marketing executive"
01:49:23;01:49:24;"from Frito-Lay--"
01:49:24;01:49:26;"I remember this from my Frito-Lay research."
01:49:26;01:49:27;"- Yeah?"
01:49:27;01:49:28;"- There was a marketing executive"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"from Frito-Lay that was visiting Disneyland"
01:49:30;01:49:31;"with his family,"
01:49:31;01:49:33;"and there was a restaurant at Disneyland"
01:49:33;01:49:34;"that was making sort of a version"
01:49:34;01:49:36;"of, uh, those chips,"
01:49:36;01:49:37;"and he was sort of like, ""Ooh,"
01:49:37;01:49:38;"""like a tortilla chip."""
01:49:38;01:49:40;"- But coated in..."
01:49:40;01:49:41;"- Yeah."
01:49:41;01:49:42;"- Dust."
01:49:42;01:49:43;"- Yeah, dust."
01:49:43;01:49:44;"- Flavored dust."
01:49:44;01:49:45;"- But anyway, in '66,"
01:49:45;01:49:47;"they start experimenting with Doritos,"
01:49:47;01:49:48;"and then in '68,"
01:49:48;01:49:50;"they were launched nationally."
01:49:50;01:49:52;"- So, 1968 wasn't all bad."
01:49:52;01:49:54;"I should point out to everybody at home,"
01:49:54;01:49:56;"like, one of the first rules of radio"
01:49:56;01:49:58;"is you don't eat on air"
01:49:58;01:50:00;"unless you announce it,"
01:50:00;01:50:01;"'cause otherwise,"
01:50:01;01:50:04;"people would hear these kind of noises."
01:50:04;01:50:06;"- Mm."
01:50:06;01:50:07;"- You're a suburban mom."
01:50:07;01:50:09;"- And be confused."
01:50:09;01:50:12;"- You're getting out of your 1968 station wagon."
01:50:12;01:50:15;"Gary Puckett, Lady Willpower,"
01:50:15;01:50:17;"is blasting on the radio."
01:50:17;01:50:19;"You go in, there's a new item"
01:50:19;01:50:21;"on the end cap of the grocery store--Doritos."
01:50:21;01:50:23;"And you're thinking, ""Lady Willpower?"

01:50:24;01:50:25;"I'm gonna buy those Doritos."""
01:50:25;01:50:26;"- You're probably thinking,"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"""This seems like a healthy snack for my kids."""
01:50:28;01:50:29;"It's 1968."
01:50:29;01:50:30;"You're probably like,"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"""It says it's a snack."
01:50:32;01:50:34;"""It's got a cool name, Doritos."""
01:50:34;01:50:35;"I mean, there's no way"
01:50:35;01:50:37;"that they would mass-market something"
01:50:37;01:50:39;"that wasn't good for you, right?"
01:50:39;01:50:40;"- That's inconceivable."
01:50:41;01:50:43;"- And it's a nice alternative to potato chips."
01:50:43;01:50:45;"- Right, potato chips are so greasy."
01:50:45;01:50:46;"This is great."
01:50:46;01:50:48;"I bet this is healthier."
01:50:48;01:50:50;"- I wonder if healthier was even a consideration."
01:50:50;01:50:53;"- Mm."
01:50:53;01:50:55;"All right, let's finish the top five."
01:50:55;01:50:57;"Number two in 1968"

01:56:46;01:56:48;"- Well, in 48 years from now,"
01:56:48;01:56:50;"when there's someone doing a radio show"
01:56:50;01:56:52;"and they're reflecting on the top five of 19--"
01:56:52;01:56:55;"of 2016, and they're like, ""That was a crazy year,"""
01:56:55;01:56:57;"when Trump won the presidency."
01:56:57;01:56:58;"- Oh, God."
01:56:58;01:57:00;"- And they're gonna listen to that Justin Timberlake song"
01:57:00;01:57:02;"and be like... [blows raspberry]"
01:57:02;01:57:04;"Wow, that was really out of step."
01:57:04;01:57:06;"- A great song."
01:57:06;01:57:08;"They're gonna be like, ""Oh, Jesus--yeah."""
01:57:08;01:57:10;"I don't even want to think about it,"
01:57:10;01:57:12;"but imagine if Trump becomes president."
01:57:12;01:57:14;"That's, like, his inauguration song."
01:57:14;01:57:15;"""Can't Stop the Feeling."""
01:57:15;01:57:17;"You know, that's a good question."
01:57:17;01:57:20;"If Trump becomes president--"
01:57:20;01:57:22;"this is, like, some heavy s--t, man."
01:57:22;01:57:24;"If somebody as diabolical as Trump"
01:57:24;01:57:26;"becomes president and actually, like,"
01:57:26;01:57:28;"is real about all this horrible thing he's saying,"
01:57:28;01:57:32;"and it really does become some, like, civil war,"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"which side is Justin Timberlake gonna take?"
01:57:34;01:57:36;"- The winners. The haves."
01:57:36;01:57:38;"- No, he can't, man."
01:57:38;01:57:40;"Trump's racist."
01:57:40;01:57:44;"Justin's gotta go on the side of the oppressed."
01:57:44;01:57:46;"But I am picturing that. Like, that stuff happened."
01:57:46;01:57:48;"That happened a lot in history, man."
01:57:48;01:57:50;"It's like somebody--like, a brutal dictator"
01:57:50;01:57:52;"with, like, a racist ideology takes power,"
01:57:52;01:57:55;"and a lot of people are just kind of like..."
01:57:55;01:57:57;"You know, they might push back a little bit"
01:57:57;01:57:59;"when there's still some pushing to do,"
01:57:59;01:58:01;"and then they kind of come, and they're just like,"
01:58:01;01:58:03;"""All right, Vichy France, man."""
01:58:03;01:58:04;"- Yeah."
01:58:04;01:58:05;"- Coco Chanel."
01:58:05;01:58:07;"Nazis took over, too. All right."
01:58:07;01:58:09;"- Yeah, and then they congratulate to power."
01:58:09;01:58:11;"- Well, I hope Justin wouldn't do that,"
01:58:11;01:58:13;"but I'm just, like, picturing, like, four years deep,"
01:58:13;01:58:15;"Trump just doing, like, this ill sh--"
01:58:15;01:58:17;"and just being like, ""Hey, Justin,"
01:58:17;01:58:19;"""you wanna come down to the White House"
01:58:19;01:58:21;"and play 'Can't Stop the Feeling?'"""
01:58:21;01:58:22;"Like, ""Absolutely, sir."""
01:58:22;01:58:24;"- I'm actually appointing an entertainment czar..."
01:58:24;01:58:25;"- Yeah."
01:58:25;01:58:27;"- Who's gonna approve appropriate culture"
01:58:27;01:58:29;"in the United States, and I think Justin Timberlake"
01:58:29;01:58:31;"could be a... - Oh, God. Stop Trump."
01:58:31;01:58:33;"We gotta stop Trump. That's no joke."
01:58:33;01:58:35;"- Well, our guy endorsed Hillary."
01:58:35;01:58:37;"- That's right. Bernie endorsed Hillary,"
01:58:37;01:58:38;"and the show on."
01:58:38;01:58:39;"- About time."
01:58:39;01:58:42;"- Yeah. I mean, it is brutal to me"
01:58:42;01:58:45;"that we came so close to having a socialist candidate"
01:58:45;01:58:49;"who was saying things that truly nobody else said,"
01:58:49;01:58:52;"but I do agree with Bernie"
01:58:52;01:58:54;"that now what's important is putting our resources"
01:58:54;01:58:56;"behind Hillary to beat Trump."
01:58:56;01:58:57;"That's important."
01:58:57;01:59:00;"And, um, we can't let our egos rule us."
01:59:00;01:59:02;"I'm still on that cool ranch Doritos high."
01:59:02;01:59:04;"- Those Doritos... - I'm just talking nonsense."
01:59:04;01:59:06;"- Those Doritos were laced with weed."
01:59:06;01:59:08;"- Man, that's a good idea, man."
01:59:08;01:59:10;"- You sound baked right now."
01:59:10;01:59:12;"- Doritos--weed Doritos?"
01:59:12;01:59:13;"- Matter of time."
01:59:13;01:59:14;"- This is a weird show."
01:59:14;01:59:17;"I think these new digs are kind of messing with my head."
01:59:17;01:59:18;"- Yeah, the..."
01:59:18;01:59:20;"- This new studio got me tripping."
01:59:20;01:59:24;"But, um, if I had to summarize this whole show,"
01:59:24;01:59:27;"I would say that it's about choosing kindness"
01:59:27;01:59:29;"and compassion over the ego."
01:59:29;01:59:31;"And it's not always easy to know"
01:59:31;01:59:33;"if you're being ruled by your ego"
01:59:33;01:59:35;"because sometimes you think"
01:59:35;01:59:38;"I'm not being ruled by my ego anymore."
01:59:38;01:59:40;"How dope am I?"
01:59:40;01:59:42;"And clearly, you got some work to do"
01:59:42;01:59:44;"if that's what's going through your head."
01:59:44;01:59:46;"- That's what Meghan Trainor taught us today."
01:59:46;01:59:47;"- That's what Meghan Trainor--"
01:59:47;01:59:49;"so thank you, Meghan, for that lesson."
01:59:49;01:59:50;"I think also another thing that,"
01:59:50;01:59:52;"if I had to summarize the whole show,"
01:59:52;01:59:54;"is that we are all humans,"
01:59:54;01:59:56;"and we do have basic needs."
01:59:56;01:59:58;"Sex is a basic need."
01:59:58;02:00:00;"However you choose to address that need,"
02:00:00;02:00:02;"that's on you."
02:00:02;02:00:04;"And so is food."
02:00:04;02:00:06;"I felt so much better when I ate"
02:00:06;02:00:08;"the Cool Ranch Doritos."
02:00:08;02:00:13;"It brought me a sense of tranquility and peace."
02:00:13;02:00:15;"And you know I have my problems"
02:00:15;02:00:17;"with the Frito-Lay Corporation."
02:00:17;02:00:20;"But on some basic human level,"
02:00:20;02:00:22;"I needed food."
02:00:22;02:00:25;"And the Cool Ranch Doritos hit the spot, man."
02:00:25;02:00:27;"- Politics be damned."
02:00:27;02:00:28;"- Politics be damned."
02:00:28;02:00:30;"We're human beings, and we need each other."
02:00:30;02:00:32;"We need food,"
02:00:32;02:00:35;"and we need the warmth of human affection."
02:00:35;02:00:38;"So that wraps up another time crisis."
02:00:38;02:00:39;"Thanks for being here, Jake."
02:00:39;02:00:40;"Everybody listening at home,"
02:00:40;02:00:42;"take care of each other."
02:00:42;02:00:44;"Do what you can do to make sure"
02:00:44;02:00:46;"Donald Trump doesn't become president."
02:00:46;02:00:48;"And keep listening to great music"
02:00:48;02:00:49;"and being kind."
02:00:49;02:00:50;"- Beats one. - Worldwide."
02:00:50;02:00:52;"- Always on."
