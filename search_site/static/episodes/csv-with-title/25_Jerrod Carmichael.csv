00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, the 25th episode."
00:05;00:09;"I'm joined by my co-host, Jake Longstreth, in the studio."
00:09;00:14;"As we discuss Cookies, John Galliano."
00:14;00:20;"We count down the songs of the summer with actor and comedian, Jarrod Carmichael."
00:20;00:27;"All this, plus the top five songs on iTunes, cross-referenced with the CMJ charts."
00:27;00:33;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:33;00:38;"B-b-b-b-b-b-b-spot one."
00:38;00:44;"They pass me by, all of those great romances."
00:44;00:51;"The war I've felt, I believe, all my rightful chances."
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seems so easy."
00:58;01:05;"And so I delve to the floor, one of us had to go."
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:10;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:16;01:21;"I'll be the lonely man."
01:21;01:27;"Time Crisis, episode 25. TC25. Can you believe it, Jake?"
01:27;01:29;"Sort of."
01:29;01:31;"We've done 25 episodes?"
01:31;01:32;"That's crazy."
01:32;01:36;"This show really is a time crisis. What have you been up to, Jake?"
01:36;01:40;"Just grinding in the studio, back at it."
01:40;01:41;"Painting?"
01:41;01:42;"Mm-hmm."
01:42;01:45;"What do you think about August? I talked with somebody today who said that August is the worst month."
01:45;01:46;"I love it."
01:46;01:47;"You love August?"
01:47;01:48;"It's one of my favorites."
01:48;01:49;"Is that just your contrarian nature?"
01:49;01:54;"No, I like that it's mellow. I like that a lot of things kind of like chill out, shut down."
01:54;01:57;"I hate that like back to school feeling."
01:57;02:01;"And even though I haven't been in school in many, many years, I know in September,"
02:01;02:06;"and even like seeing, like driving by like a school with an LED sign on the front that says like,"
02:06;02:09;"""Classes start August 17th."""
02:09;02:14;"I'm just like, ""Dude, are you serious? That's so brutal."""
02:14;02:19;"I get bummed for people having to go back to school, and especially mid-August,"
02:19;02:24;"which is like emotionally and psychologically not the time to go."
02:24;02:30;"You're just ripping across Fountain in your minivan, cranking some tunes,"
02:30;02:33;"and then you just drive past like a high school."
02:33;02:38;"It's like a local L.A. high school that's like, ""Sign up for clubs first week back."""
02:38;02:41;"And you're just like, ""See that?"" Just shake your head."
02:41;02:42;"Man."
02:42;02:48;"Back to school, back to school, to prove to dad that I'm not a fool."
02:48;02:52;"School's out for summer. I mean, I like the dog days of summer."
02:52;02:55;"I like that expression. I like the long days."
02:55;03:00;"I like it when it's hot, but you can go at your own pace a little bit."
03:00;03:02;"Things really do slow down."
03:02;03:05;"The world is going to pick up again in September, and I'm fine with that."
03:05;03:08;"I'm ready to really start cranking with the rest of the world."
03:08;03:13;"I like guilt-free leisure vibes in August."
03:13;03:16;"I feel like in Europe, this is when everybody goes on vacation."
03:16;03:17;"Right."
03:17;03:19;"Paid vacation."
03:19;03:22;"So I feel like over there, it's like things slow down"
03:22;03:27;"because people are leaving the cities, going to explore a little bit,"
03:27;03:31;"get some fresh air, go to the mountains, go to the beach or something."
03:31;03:35;"Whereas I feel like in America, it's like grinding it out in August."
03:35;03:37;"You kind of just feel like you're left behind."
03:37;03:38;"Yeah, if you're just working."
03:38;03:41;"Working through August. It's not a holiday for me."
03:41;03:43;"How about you, August?"
03:43;03:45;"Eh. It's okay."
03:45;03:47;"Are you a summer guy? Are you pumped for fall?"
03:47;03:49;"Yeah, depending on where I am."
03:49;03:51;"L.A. doesn't really have much of a fall."
03:51;03:54;"In fact, L.A., sometimes September is hotter than August."
03:54;03:55;"True."
03:55;03:59;"So, yeah, of course I love an East Coast autumn."
03:59;04:01;"Yeah, August is kind of lame."
04:01;04:04;"I remember when I was a kid, you get July and August off."
04:04;04:06;"July was like Saturday."
04:06;04:07;"Yeah."
04:07;04:09;"I just thought of that, man."
04:09;04:12;"July and August are the Saturday and Sunday of summer."
04:12;04:14;"Yeah."
04:14;04:15;"Sunday is pretty rad, though."
04:15;04:17;"You like Sundays?"
04:17;04:19;"Well, no, I feel you."
04:19;04:22;"There's nothing like the exhilaration of being in seventh grade"
04:22;04:25;"and it's mid-July and you're just like--"
04:25;04:26;"Right."
04:26;04:27;"There's like seven weeks of summer,"
04:27;04:29;"which seems like an eternity when you're that age."
04:29;04:31;"Yeah. No, yes, it's important."
04:31;04:33;"Context is important. You know you got this time coming up."
04:33;04:35;"August is a month of Sundays."
04:35;04:37;"Man, I just thought of that."
04:37;04:38;"That's a lyric, dude."
04:38;04:39;"Start working on that."
04:39;04:42;"The dog days are over"
04:42;04:45;"The dog days are done"
04:45;04:48;"The horses are coming"
04:48;04:51;"So you better run"
04:51;04:53;"Run fast for your mother"
04:53;04:55;"Run fast for your father"
04:55;04:56;"Run for your children"
04:56;04:57;"Run for your sisters"
04:57;04:58;"Run for your brothers"
04:58;05:01;"Leave all your love and your glory behind"
05:01;05:04;"You can't carry it with you if you want to survive"
05:04;05:07;"The dog days are over"
05:07;05:11;"The dog days are done"
05:11;05:14;"Hey, the heroes are here"
05:14;05:16;"The heroes are here"
05:16;05:19;"They come"
05:19;05:21;"Moving on."
05:21;05:24;"Jake, do you know who Toots Thielmans is?"
05:24;05:25;"No, I don't."
05:25;05:26;"It's a name I always remember"
05:26;05:28;"because in the early days of Vampire Weekend,"
05:28;05:31;"we'd go do European press tours,"
05:31;05:34;"get to spend a lot of time with the label rep"
05:34;05:36;"in different countries."
05:36;05:38;"I feel like once we were doing an interview or something"
05:38;05:42;"with our label guy, Jan, in Belgium,"
05:42;05:46;"and somehow we were just talking about Belgian history,"
05:46;05:48;"Belgian pride,"
05:48;05:50;"and maybe he was just like,"
05:50;05:51;"""What Belgians do you know?"""
05:51;05:53;"Luc Toymans."
05:53;05:54;"Who's that?"
05:54;05:55;"Painter."
05:55;05:56;"Oh, wait, from back in the day?"
05:56;05:57;"No, contemporary."
05:57;05:58;"All right."
05:58;05:59;"Not familiar."
05:59;06:02;"I was like, ""Who are truly internationally famous Belgians?"""
06:02;06:03;"Like, household names."
06:03;06:05;"And I was like, ""Jean-Claude Van Damme,"""
06:05;06:07;"and then it's like steep drop-off,"
06:07;06:08;"and I was like, ""Damn, man."""
06:08;06:09;"Hercule Poirot."
06:09;06:10;"Who's that?"
06:10;06:12;"The Agatha Christie detective."
06:12;06:14;"Oh, fictional character doesn't count."
06:14;06:16;"And Agatha Christie wasn't Belgian."
06:16;06:17;"So I was like, ""It's no diss,"
06:17;06:21;"""but is the one truly internationally famous Belgian"
06:21;06:23;"""Jean-Claude Van Damme?"""
06:23;06:25;"And they're like, ""No, of course not."
06:25;06:28;"""The best harmonica player in the world is Belgian."""
06:28;06:32;"And I was like, ""John Popper is from New Jersey."""
06:32;06:33;"And they were like--"
06:33;06:34;"Who's that?"
06:34;06:35;"Yeah, exactly."
06:35;06:36;"They're like, ""Who's John Popper?"""
06:36;06:37;"And I was like, ""He was the lead singer"
06:37;06:41;"""and harmonica player in 'Blues Traveler.'"""
06:41;06:43;"And he was almost like, ""Yo, keep your voice down."
06:43;06:45;"""He is not the best harmonica player in the world."""
06:45;06:46;"I was like, ""Yeah, he is."
06:46;06:47;"""Everybody kind of agrees."""
06:47;06:48;"He's like, ""No, of course not."
06:48;06:49;"""It's Tooth Sillman."""
06:49;06:50;"And I was like, ""Who's that?"""
06:50;06:52;"And he's like, ""You seriously don't know who this dude is?"""
06:52;06:53;"And he was probably right."
06:53;06:54;"I probably should have."
06:54;06:57;"But he was like, ""He's one of the most famous Belgians."""
06:57;06:58;"Hmm."
06:58;07:00;"""He's the best harmonica player in the world."""
07:00;07:02;"And I was like, ""Is it on some, like,"
07:02;07:04;"""Belgium's Got Talent type thing?"
07:04;07:05;"""Like, he's just really good?"""
07:05;07:08;"And he's like, ""No, he's like the Miles Davis of harmonica."""
07:08;07:10;"And then I was like, read up on this guy,"
07:10;07:13;"and I was like, ""Oh, wow, this guy is, like, really serious."
07:13;07:15;"""He, like, pioneered jazz harmonica,"
07:15;07:16;"""and he truly was one of the best players,"
07:16;07:18;"""and he played with all sorts of people."""
07:18;07:20;"So this was maybe eight years ago."
07:20;07:22;"I was just an ignorant American."
07:22;07:23;"Yeah."
07:23;07:26;"This is my equivalent of the Ryan Lochte story."
07:26;07:28;"Just a dumb American abroad."
07:28;07:30;"And after that, I always tried to, you know,"
07:30;07:32;"correct my behavior and be like, you know,"
07:32;07:34;"show respect and love to Tooth Sillman."
07:34;07:37;"And I was very sad last week to see that he died at the age of 94."
07:37;07:40;"And so I want to pay so that other people"
07:40;07:42;"don't make the same ignorant mistake that I made"
07:42;07:45;"and think that John Popper is the most famous harmonica player in the world."
07:45;07:48;"I want to pay tribute to this man."
07:48;07:50;"And just to give you a-- 'cause, like, some people probably--"
07:50;07:53;"it's hard to even picture what it means to be great at harmonica."
07:53;07:55;"Yeah, I'm drawing a blank here."
07:55;07:59;"He was known for usually playing jazz."
07:59;08:01;"He had, like, a band of other Belgians."
08:01;08:03;"He played with everybody."
08:03;08:06;"So he came to the States and, like, had a pickup band and toured,"
08:06;08:09;"or would, like, sit in with, like, Miles Davis quintet or something?"
08:09;08:11;"Yeah, I don't want to say exactly who,"
08:11;08:14;"but, like, he definitely worked with Quincy Jones."
08:14;08:16;"People--real jazz people."
08:16;08:18;"Here's him playing ""I Love You, Porgy."""
08:18;08:20;"You know, Gershwin jazz standard."
08:20;08:22;"So what year are we talking here?"
08:22;08:24;"Like '60s, '50s?"
08:24;08:26;"Ooh."
08:26;08:29;"[playing ""I Love You, Porgy""]"
08:29;08:38;"This is a live recording."
08:38;08:43;"You know, that's a difficult instrument to, like, articulate on."
08:43;08:45;"Very."
08:45;08:48;"Most kids had a harmonica at some point, and you play it, it's like..."
08:48;08:54;"Listen to the dynamics."
08:55;08:57;"[playing ""I Love You, Porgy""]"
08:57;08:59;"I would not have guessed that's a harmonica."
08:59;09:01;"I would have thought it was an accordion."
09:01;09:03;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
09:03;09:06;"So that's kind of him doing, like, his more standard jazz stuff."
09:06;09:09;"So a lot of people probably feel like, oh, that's interesting,"
09:09;09:12;"it's kind of like a quirk, but a lot of people don't realize"
09:12;09:15;"they've heard this guy's work because he played on all sorts of stuff."
09:15;09:17;"Like, you might remember this."
09:17;09:20;"[playing ""I Love You, Porgy""]"
09:20;09:22;"That's Toots."
09:23;09:25;"Okay."
09:25;09:27;"You recognize it?"
09:27;09:29;"Give me a second. Yeah, Sesame Street."
09:29;09:31;"Sesame Street."
09:31;09:33;"Is this the original?"
09:33;09:35;"I think so."
09:35;09:37;"Sounds good."
09:37;09:43;"It's kind of like ""Love Me Do."""
09:43;09:45;"Yeah."
09:45;09:48;"Almost like-- or like a weird outtake of Pet Sounds."
09:48;09:50;"Yeah."
09:50;09:52;"Oh, he totally could have, like, played on some Brahms."
09:52;09:54;"Some, like, weird Wrecking Crew stuff."
09:54;09:56;"Yeah, he would have been the harmonica in the Wrecking Crew."
09:56;09:58;"Yeah."
09:58;10:00;"He even played with a Time Crisis favorite."
10:00;10:02;"Well, let me guess. Yeah, guess."
10:02;10:04;"Herb Alpert. More of a favorite."
10:04;10:06;"Like from the '60s? Gary Puckett?"
10:06;10:08;"No, no, no, no."
10:08;10:10;"No, you're going too deep."
10:10;10:12;"Someone that we actually had on the show? No."
10:12;10:15;"Someone that definitely comes up in conversation."
10:15;10:17;"Legendary artist. Oh, Peter Cetera."
10:17;10:19;"No, you're going way too deep, man."
10:19;10:21;"Too deep?"
10:21;10:23;"I'm talking about, like, a major artist."
10:23;10:27;"A major artist who had a touch of jazz in his pop music,"
10:27;10:30;"who had a lot of shredder musicians on his records."
10:30;10:32;"MJ?"
10:32;10:34;"Getting warmer, I guess."
10:34;10:36;"Um..."
10:36;10:39;"Let me try to think. I'm guessing here, but..."
10:39;10:41;"Maybe about a... Give me, like, a decade here."
10:41;10:44;"Five, five, five, four, Caucasian male."
10:44;10:46;"Paul Simon?"
10:46;10:48;"I think Paul Simon's probably less than five, four."
10:48;10:50;"Taller than Paul Simon."
10:50;10:52;"Caucasian male."
10:52;10:54;"From the greater New York area."
10:54;10:56;"Joel. Joel."
10:56;10:58;"Finally. Okay, okay."
10:58;11:00;"So he played on Billy's song,"
11:00;11:03;"""Leave a Tender Moment Alone,"" from ""An Innocent Man."""
11:03;11:05;"Deeper cut?"
11:05;11:07;"Ooh. Oh, no, this is a classic."
11:07;11:12;"It's like they're talking to each other."
11:12;11:14;"So Billy was just like, ""Get toots in here."""
11:14;11:16;"Yeah, I guess so."
11:16;11:18;"Ooh. It kind of almost reminds me"
11:18;11:21;"a little bit of that Stevie Wonder harmonica tone."
11:21;11:23;"Yeah."
11:23;11:27;"# Even though I'm in love"
11:27;11:30;"# Sometimes I get so afraid"
11:30;11:32;"What year is this?"
11:32;11:34;"I think, like, '80s."
11:34;11:38;"This sounds huge."
11:38;11:42;"# I know the moment isn't right"
11:42;11:44;"'83."
11:44;11:47;"# To tell the girl to come a good life... #"
11:47;11:49;"This is from his, like, his throwback album."
11:49;11:51;"# ...So I'm gonna let you lie... #"
11:51;11:53;"Is this the one with ""Uptown Girl"" on it?"
11:53;11:55;"Yeah, same album. Oh, okay."
11:55;11:57;"# ...I'm just frightened out of my mind"
11:57;12:01;"# But if that's how I feel"
12:01;12:05;"# Then it's the best feeling I've ever known... #"
12:05;12:07;"Yeah, this kind of has, like..."
12:07;12:09;"This could have been, like, a kind of schmaltzy ballad"
12:09;12:12;"in the top five of 1968."
12:12;12:14;"Right."
12:14;12:16;"# Yes, I know I'm in love... #"
12:16;12:18;"Listen to that. Just two great men."
12:18;12:20;"They're in dialogue."
12:20;12:23;"# But just when I ought to relax"
12:23;12:25;"# I put my foot in the door... #"
12:25;12:28;"This is before the days of high-speed Internet connection"
12:28;12:30;"across the Atlantic."
12:30;12:32;"Toots visited Metsa Studios."
12:32;12:34;"Oh, yeah, it's sad to imagine, but today,"
12:34;12:36;"if Billy Joel and Toots were working together,"
12:36;12:38;"Billy would probably be like..."
12:38;12:40;"""I'm not leaving my house."""
12:40;12:42;"Or, like, a producer or something."
12:42;12:44;"""Hey, you know any good harmonica players?"""
12:44;12:47;"""Yeah, Billy, man, there's this real great cat out in Brussels."""
12:47;12:50;"And he'd be like, ""Well, have him email us a potential solo."
12:50;12:52;"""Tell him to do five different takes."
12:52;12:54;"""Pick the best one, comp it together."
12:54;12:56;"""I'm gonna, uh..."""
12:56;12:58;"""Comp it together."""
12:58;13:00;"""I'm gonna go play Pokemon Go outside."""
13:00;13:02;"That's brutal."
13:02;13:04;"But, like, there really is something, that song in Sesame Street,"
13:04;13:06;"there's something just feel-good about Toots' playing."
13:06;13:08;"Yeah."
13:08;13:10;"I think everybody can maybe, you know,"
13:10;13:12;"take a second to Google Toots Thielman's."
13:12;13:15;"Obviously, keep his family and friends in our thoughts."
13:15;13:18;"But '94 is, like, that's a hell of a long time to live."
13:18;13:21;"And clearly this guy left behind a huge body of work."
13:21;13:24;"It's a great run, man. May we all be so lucky."
13:24;13:27;"Clearly he dedicated himself to something."
13:27;13:29;"Very specific, too."
13:29;13:31;"Very specific."
13:31;13:33;"That's really interesting."
13:33;13:35;"He owned a land."
13:35;13:40;"# #"
14:04;14:07;"That was some more music from the legendary Toots Thielman."
14:07;14:09;"Rest in peace."
14:09;14:11;"Coming up on the show, we got Gerard Carmichael,"
14:11;14:13;"long-time friend of the show, coming through."
14:13;14:15;"Haven't seen him in a minute."
14:15;14:17;"Cool."
14:17;14:19;"We're gonna be talking about the songs of the summer."
14:19;14:21;"Now that we're in the dog days of summer,"
14:21;14:23;"we can officially say what the songs of the summer were."
14:23;14:25;"And then we're gonna be getting into the top five"
14:25;14:27;"with a back-to-school special."
14:27;14:30;"We're gonna compare the top five songs on iTunes,"
14:30;14:32;"which is maybe a slightly more populist version"
14:32;14:34;"of what people are listening to,"
14:34;14:36;"and then we're gonna compare with the top five songs"
14:36;14:38;"on the CMJ charts, which is about college radio."
14:38;14:40;"I didn't even know that was a thing still."
14:40;14:42;"Yeah, as long as there's colleges"
14:42;14:44;"and as long as there's college radio, man,"
14:44;14:46;"there'll be a college radio chart."
14:46;14:48;"And there's the dudes that are working"
14:48;14:50;"at the college radio station."
14:50;14:52;"Yeah. Did you ever do college radio?"
14:52;14:54;"Yeah. What was your show all about?"
14:54;14:56;"It's called ""The Jake and Dave Show."""
14:56;14:58;"I had a friend named Dave Kolek,"
14:58;15:00;"and it was kind of a talk format."
15:00;15:02;"From ""Time Crisis."""
15:02;15:04;"My freshman-- I guess it would've been my sophomore year."
15:04;15:07;"We had a discussion about the future of the Internet,"
15:07;15:09;"which would be an amazing tape to find."
15:09;15:11;"Wow. Can you look for that?"
15:11;15:13;"Dave has it. I'll ask him."
15:13;15:15;"Oh, I'd love to play that on ""Time Crisis."""
15:15;15:17;"That'd be hilarious."
15:17;15:19;"Just a couple Lewis and Clark undergrads."
15:19;15:23;"We had this soci-- or I think a poli-sci professor on"
15:23;15:25;"to discuss the Internet in 1996."
15:25;15:27;"Wait, you know, that's interesting, man."
15:27;15:29;"That's something I've been thinking about lately."
15:29;15:32;"Whenever I find myself feeling, like, overwhelmed"
15:32;15:34;"or dissatisfied with the world,"
15:34;15:36;"I talk about it with people."
15:36;15:40;"I'm often, like-- it's very easy for us to point to the Internet"
15:40;15:43;"as being one of the major things"
15:43;15:47;"that's causing even more misery in people's lives today."
15:47;15:51;"It's like everybody is a little bit addicted to their phone,"
15:51;15:54;"the constant stream of, like, information and opinions."
15:54;15:56;"How much time do you spend on the Internet?"
15:56;15:58;"That's a good question."
15:58;16:01;"So you mean, like, how much time am I spending a day"
16:01;16:03;"interfacing with, like, a computer screen?"
16:03;16:05;"Yeah, or how much do you check your phone?"
16:05;16:07;"And not counting, like, anomalous,"
16:07;16:09;"'cause I know, like, maybe on a Sunday afternoon"
16:09;16:11;"you might spend four hours"
16:11;16:14;"just, like, on the Grateful Dead tabs website."
16:14;16:16;"You're not wrong."
16:16;16:19;"I just mean kind of, like, mindless Internet consumption."
16:19;16:21;"I'll probably do an hour a day."
16:21;16:23;"Total? Yeah."
16:23;16:26;"Like, when I'm eating lunch, like, when I'm at my studio"
16:26;16:29;"and I'm editing, I, like, make a turkey sandwich or something,"
16:29;16:31;"and I'm just, like, laptop open."
16:31;16:33;"You just munch it on the turkey sandwich?"
16:33;16:35;"Yeah. Just what are you scrolling?"
16:35;16:37;"Twitter? New York Times?"
16:37;16:39;"Not really the Times. Twitter, Pitchfork."
16:39;16:41;"Wall Street Journal? Yeah, whatever."
16:41;16:43;"Facebook. And then usually I find an article,"
16:43;16:45;"you click on it, and then you go from there."
16:45;16:47;"What about when you get home at the end of the day?"
16:47;16:49;"No. When you spend time with your girlfriend?"
16:49;16:51;"Yeah. And if she's not home..."
16:51;16:53;"You're not on the Internet."
16:53;16:56;"Glass of tequila, grab the guitar,"
16:56;16:58;"start working on those Dead tabs."
17:40;17:42;"What about you?"
17:42;17:44;"I'd be like an addict."
17:44;17:46;"But also an addict in the sense that"
17:46;17:48;"it can be a little like feast or famine."
17:48;17:50;"I'd be like start checking a lot,"
17:50;17:52;"and I'd be like burned out."
17:52;17:54;"I'd see some things I don't want to see,"
17:54;17:56;"whether it's like people saying things to me,"
17:56;17:58;"or even increasingly when I see people"
17:58;18:00;"getting in fights with each other,"
18:00;18:02;"I almost feel like I'm on some like,"
18:02;18:04;"what was that movie with the zombies,"
18:04;18:06;"28 Days Later? Yeah."
18:06;18:08;"You know when they got infected with rage?"
18:08;18:10;"I increasingly when I see other people"
18:10;18:12;"I feel like it's going to infect me."
18:12;18:14;"Do you see that on Twitter? Where do you see that?"
18:14;18:16;"Yeah, see maybe, you probably just have..."
18:16;18:18;"I'm not a famous musician, dude."
18:18;18:20;"You just got a cleaner feed."
18:20;18:22;"My Twitter situation is like mellow."
18:22;18:24;"Right, but come on, it's an election year."
18:24;18:26;"Surely you've seen some like people"
18:26;18:28;"getting in fights about ideology or politics."
18:28;18:30;"Yeah, but it's not, I mean..."
18:30;18:32;"Yeah, well, so whatever. Sometimes I see that stuff"
18:32;18:34;"and it bothers me and I'm like, yo."
18:34;18:36;"I'm out. Let me just like read my book."
18:36;18:38;"Nice. And then I'll start reading my book."
18:38;18:40;"It's kind of random because I've always loved fashion."
18:40;18:42;"Yep."
18:42;18:44;"But I don't know..."
18:44;18:46;"The reason Time Crisis we talk about music"
18:46;18:48;"and not fashion is because I know more about music."
18:48;18:50;"And fashion often has struck me as a world"
18:50;18:52;"so similar to music in terms of like"
18:52;18:54;"the characters, the signifiers, whatever."
18:54;18:56;"But like, I'm a little bit like grandpa"
18:56;18:58;"when it comes to learning about that stuff."
18:58;19:00;"So I was at the bookstore the other day"
19:00;19:02;"and I saw this book called Gods and Kings"
19:02;19:04;"and it's about Alexander McQueen and John Galliano."
19:04;19:06;"And I was like, man, these are two"
19:06;19:08;"incredibly famous people."
19:08;19:10;"Many people consider iconic."
19:10;19:12;"And I know very little about them."
19:12;19:14;"All I know about John Galliano is that"
19:14;19:16;"he got caught on tape saying anti-Semitic"
19:16;19:18;"stuff drunk at a Paris bar."
19:18;19:20;"And all I really know about Alexander McQueen"
19:20;19:22;"is that someone once gave me"
19:22;19:24;"an Alexander McQueen pea coat,"
19:24;19:26;"which I love, and I know that he killed himself."
19:26;19:28;"So I know these kind of like dark, sad things"
19:28;19:30;"about these people. I've never even heard of Galliano."
19:30;19:32;"Oh, really? Yeah."
19:32;19:34;"He was a famous designer in his own right"
19:34;19:36;"until he really became famous"
19:36;19:38;"when he became the head designer for Dior."
19:38;19:40;"Okay. You know Dior, right?"
19:40;19:42;"Yeah, I mean, I'm familiar with it as a brand that exists."
19:42;19:44;"And you're familiar with the types of fabrics"
19:44;19:46;"they use and the silhouettes that they're famous for"
19:46;19:48;"and their haute couture."
19:48;19:50;"Not really."
19:50;19:52;"John Galliano is also interesting."
19:52;19:54;"But you didn't hear about this"
19:54;19:56;"and then he got dismissed from Dior."
19:56;19:58;"No, was this recently? This was like a few years ago."
19:58;20:00;"This is an offshoot of Time Crisis."
20:00;20:02;"This is our new show."
20:02;20:04;"Time Crisis Fashion Edition."
20:04;20:24;"Rest in peace, David Bowie."
20:24;20:26;"This is a new segment on Time Crisis."
20:26;20:28;"It's called Fashion."
20:28;20:30;"So, Jake, I want to tell you more about John Galliano."
20:30;20:32;"He's already very famous in certain circles"
20:32;20:34;"but the story blew up because"
20:34;20:36;"he was caught on video,"
20:36;20:38;"somebody taped him on his phone,"
20:38;20:40;"saying a series of really"
20:40;20:42;"hateful, cruel, and anti-Semitic things"
20:42;20:44;"to a couple of people"
20:44;20:46;"at a bar in Paris."
20:46;20:48;"And you can tell he's intoxicated. When?"
20:48;20:50;"I don't know, three years ago? Okay, recently."
20:50;20:52;"So this is like a guy at the top of the fashion game."
20:52;20:54;"He's like the head designer for one of the biggest"
20:54;20:56;"fashion houses and he's there."
20:56;20:58;"I forget what he says. He says, ""You're ugly."""
20:58;21:00;"Is he American?"
21:00;21:02;"He was British."
21:02;21:04;"Like the Mel Gibson vibe."
21:04;21:06;"It was like a Mel Gibson vibe. It's like some"
21:06;21:08;"Zoolander sh*t. It's like the worst nightmare of what"
21:08;21:10;"a big designer would be like."
21:10;21:12;"Like mean, catty,"
21:12;21:14;"and hateful."
21:14;21:16;"So he literally is there drunk, just being like,"
21:16;21:18;"saying to this person,"
21:18;21:20;"""You're ugly. I love"
21:20;21:22;"Hitler."" So obviously it was outrageous."
21:22;21:24;"People were horrified."
21:24;21:26;"Quickly condemned, dismissed."
21:26;21:28;"Went to rehab,"
21:28;21:30;"whatever. But I remember that whole story."
21:30;21:32;"I mean, clearly he needed it."
21:32;21:34;"But I remember during that whole story,"
21:34;21:36;"I was like, you know, obviously the headline is"
21:36;21:38;"John Galliano is horrible"
21:38;21:40;"anti-Semite, right?"
21:40;21:42;"And I'm not saying that he's not, but I just remember"
21:42;21:44;"when I heard that story, another part of me was like,"
21:44;21:46;"""What is this rich, famous"
21:46;21:48;"fashion designer doing sitting alone"
21:48;21:50;"at a bar by himself?"""
21:50;21:52;"It is very Gibson vibe."
21:52;21:54;"You get down to it and you're just kind of like,"
21:54;21:56;"I'm not saying that you have to like"
21:56;21:58;"him. He said really horrendous"
21:58;22:00;"things, but then the human interest part of me"
22:00;22:02;"was just kind of like, ""What was going on?"
22:02;22:04;"Why were you by yourself? You can go for a"
22:04;22:06;"drink by yourself, sure, but why are you just like"
22:06;22:08;"plastered at a"
22:08;22:10;"bar in Paris, like alone?"""
22:10;22:12;"Yikes. So whatever. I haven't"
22:12;22:14;"gotten to the end of the book, but being a"
22:14;22:16;"fashion designer, very difficult."
22:16;22:18;"Grueling and cutthroat."
22:18;22:20;"What little I know. Yeah."
22:20;22:22;"It's like the music industry"
22:22;22:24;"in the nth degree. Right. And that concludes"
22:24;22:26;"our new"
22:26;22:28;"segment on Time Crisis."
22:28;22:30;"Fashion! We'll revisit that one."
22:30;22:32;"We'll catch up with... Maybe we can"
22:32;22:34;"get John Galliano on the show sometime."
22:34;22:36;"That'd be tight. Fashion!"
22:36;22:38;"Turn to the left. Fashion!"
22:38;22:40;"Turn to the right."
22:40;22:42;"Ooh, fashion!"

22:46;22:48;"coming to town."

24:58;24:59;"We got a lot of positive feedback"

25:01;25:03;"when I ate Doritos a few shows ago."
25:03;25:05;"So a lot of people don't know this,"
25:05;25:10;"but Seinfeld 2000 is part of the Time Crisis family."
25:10;25:12;"We don't get him on the mic that often,"
25:12;25:15;"but after our infamous beef,"
25:15;25:17;"we actually gave the man a job."

25:22;25:24;"What's up, Seinfeld 2000?"
25:24;25:25;"I'm forever grateful."
25:25;25:26;"Thank you for putting me on."
25:26;25:28;"I'm usually behind the scenes here,"
25:28;25:30;"but, yeah, here I am."
25:30;25:32;"Well, you know, we're just killin' time over here, man,"
25:32;25:35;"and we thought a good segment to do"
25:35;25:37;"would be one about cookies,"
25:37;25:40;"because we know that people love Seinfeld 2000,"
25:40;25:42;"and we know that people love food."
25:42;25:45;"So there happened to be a lot of cookies in the studio today."
25:45;25:47;"So we're just gonna talk about them,"
25:47;25:49;"maybe even eat a few."
25:49;25:50;"I want to describe--"
25:50;25:51;"I'll hit one of the Milanos."
25:51;25:53;"To the listener what we have."
25:53;25:55;"I'm handing Jake a bag of Milanos"
25:55;25:58;"and their orange chocolate."
25:58;25:59;"Are you mad about that?"
25:59;26:01;"Yeah, I hate it when they mix fruit."
26:01;26:03;"Fruit with chocolate."
26:03;26:04;"Really?"
26:04;26:05;"Keep it pure."
26:05;26:08;"We have Tim Tam."
26:08;26:11;"That seems like some British type thing."
26:11;26:13;"We have Fig Newtons."
26:13;26:14;"Classic."
26:14;26:15;"Classic, like, healthy."
26:15;26:16;"Yep."
26:16;26:17;"Are they healthy, though?"
26:17;26:21;"I didn't even realize Fig Newtons were, like, a legit cookie"
26:21;26:23;"until picking it up, and it says ""cookie"" on it."
26:23;26:26;"I thought that was in a class on its own."
26:26;26:29;"Fig Newtons used to have an ad campaign"
26:29;26:31;"that was about how they're not cookies."
26:31;26:34;"Well, they've sold out then, 'cause I think they're now"
26:34;26:36;"squarely in the cookie camp."
26:36;26:38;"We also have three different types of Oreos,"
26:38;26:39;"none of which are standard."
26:39;26:41;"I'm not eating Oreos anymore, you know that."
26:41;26:43;"We have blueberry pie Oreos."
26:43;26:45;"We also have Oreo Thins."
26:45;26:47;"And we have birthday cake Oreos."
26:47;26:49;"Wait, wait, there's no standard Oreos?"
26:49;26:51;"No, but we do have--"
26:51;26:53;"Who bought these cookies?"
26:53;26:56;"We do have JoJo's, which are Trader Joe's."
26:56;27:00;"This is definitely one of the most random time crises"
27:00;27:01;"of all time."
27:01;27:03;"Can I just say, this is like a thing."
27:03;27:06;"When someone goes to get cookies or bagels or whatever"
27:06;27:09;"for, like, an office thing, they never get the straight-up one."
27:09;27:11;"No one gets the straight-up Oreo."
27:11;27:15;"They get the blueberry and the birthday cake"
27:15;27:18;"and the, you know, butterscotch Oreo."
27:18;27:20;"Or, like, wasn't that-- that was a major plot point"
27:20;27:24;"in Home Alone, that Kevin was very upset"
27:24;27:27;"that his family ordered all these, like, unique pizzas,"
27:27;27:29;"and he just wanted a plain pizza."
27:29;27:30;"Right."
27:30;27:34;"And it's a very cathartic moment later in the film"
27:34;27:38;"when Kevin sits down at the table"
27:38;27:43;"of the now almost-empty McAllister family home,"
27:43;27:47;"and he opens a pizza,"
27:47;27:52;"finally fulfilling the promise of capitalism,"
27:52;27:55;"something just for him,"
27:55;27:59;"and he says, ""A fresh cheese pizza, all for me."""
27:59;28:02;"Basically, I think that part of the movie is saying"
28:02;28:07;"that to fulfill his ultimate role as a consumer,"
28:07;28:09;"getting exactly what he wanted,"
28:09;28:13;"he had to sacrifice the comfort of family,"
28:13;28:18;"and ultimately he places himself in harm's way."
28:18;28:19;"Worth it."
28:19;28:21;"Have you seen this film, Jake, Home Alone?"
28:21;28:22;"Not in many years."
28:22;28:23;"Really?"
28:23;28:24;"Okay."
28:24;28:26;"I got to return these Oreos. Sorry."
28:26;28:28;"You're not going to try the blueberry pie Oreos?"
28:28;28:30;"I'm not eating Oreos anymore. You know that."
28:30;28:32;"Please try the blueberry pie Oreos."
28:32;28:33;"Did you buy all these?"
28:33;28:34;"Yeah."
28:34;28:36;"I'm sorry. I don't mean to be so negative."
28:36;28:37;"It's okay."
28:37;28:42;"We're trying JoJo's, the Trader Joe's, off-brand Oreos."
28:42;28:43;"Not as good as an Oreo."
28:43;28:44;"Yeah."
28:44;28:45;"What's the difference?"
28:45;28:47;"I think-- I think it's drier."
28:47;28:49;"Sweeter, too. It's not as tart."
28:49;28:50;"Tart?"
28:50;28:52;"It's very, very close."
28:52;28:55;"Oreos, weirdly, the cookie part is very dry,"
28:55;28:57;"and then the filling is almost--"
28:57;29:00;"I don't want to say moist, but it's like-- it's not dry."
29:00;29:03;"It's a very specific chemical state."
29:03;29:05;"It's probably got silica gel."
29:05;29:06;"Yeah."
29:06;29:12;"All right, Jake, you got to take a bite of a blueberry pie Oreo."
29:12;29:14;"It's a good-looking cookie."
29:14;29:15;"Is it, though?"
29:15;29:16;"It's purple."
29:16;29:18;"It's purple inside. It's both."
29:18;29:20;"The cookie is-- how do they define the cookie?"
29:20;29:22;"Does it say on the packaging?"
29:22;29:25;"It's sort of a manila cookie wafer"
29:25;29:28;"with a sort of, like, just pure purple--"
29:28;29:31;"Oh!"
29:31;29:33;"You're not feeling the [bleep] sick."
29:33;29:35;"You're not feeling the blueberry Oreo?"
29:35;29:37;"Why? Why is it sick, though?"
29:37;29:38;"Wait, you mean sick in a positive way?"
29:38;29:39;"No."
29:39;29:41;"Wait, who uses sick in a negative way these days?"
29:41;29:42;"True."
29:42;29:44;"It's ill."
29:44;29:45;"It's an ill [bleep] cookie."
29:45;29:46;"That's sick."
29:46;29:48;"Buff cookie."
29:48;29:51;"You're finding the blueberry Oreo disgusting?"
29:51;29:53;"Super buff."
29:53;29:55;"Do you want to try a birthday cake Oreo?"
29:55;29:56;"No."
29:56;29:57;"I'm not eating Oreos anymore. You know that."
29:57;29:59;"Here's the thing."
29:59;30:01;"The filling--"
30:01;30:03;"The filling is just over the top."
30:03;30:06;"It's just, like, thermonuclear sweetness."
30:06;30:07;"Oh."
30:07;30:08;"It's just, like--"
30:08;30:10;"I just feel like my tooth is just rotting."
30:10;30:11;"I'm out."
30:11;30:12;"You want it?"
30:12;30:13;"You're not even going to finish."
30:13;30:16;"You can't even eat one full blueberry Oreo cookie."
30:16;30:20;"I'm going to have a swig of this medicinal red-tail amber ale."
30:20;30:22;"Antiseptic."
30:22;30:26;"Also, like, the beer with the cookie, it's really--"
30:26;30:29;"Beer with cookie is a classic weird combination."
30:29;30:31;"I feel like I've hit it a lot in my life by accident."
30:31;30:32;"That's, like, late in the party."
30:32;30:33;"Right."
30:33;30:34;"And you're kind of drunk and hungry,"
30:34;30:36;"and you're just like, ""Oh!"""
30:36;30:42;"Man, so what have we learned about cookies?"
30:42;30:43;"[chuckles]"
30:43;30:45;"Shockingly little."
30:45;30:48;"Maybe we won't bring back the cookie segment, but--"
30:48;30:49;"One and done."
30:50;30:53;"That was something special for Time Crisis '25."
30:53;30:54;"Nailed it."
30:55;30:58;"(SINGING) Gym class hero."
30:58;31:00;"Radio killer."
31:00;31:02;"You know what it is."
31:02;31:04;"Gym class hero."
31:04;31:06;"And, Dre, it's hard to look innocent"
31:06;31:08;"when I got cookie crumbs all over my face."
31:08;31:09;"Yeah."
31:09;31:12;"I like girls."
31:12;31:13;"They like me."
31:13;31:17;"They look so good, and they suck when I'm jigging."
31:17;31:22;"So, do you be the one and the only?"
31:22;31:26;"I want to be faithful, but I can't keep my hands"
31:26;31:27;"out the cookie jar."
31:27;31:28;"My hands."
31:30;31:32;"Can't keep my hands."
31:32;31:33;"My hands."
31:33;31:35;"My, my, my."
31:35;31:37;"Can't keep my hands."
31:37;31:39;"My, my, my."
31:39;31:41;"Can't keep my hands."
31:41;31:42;"My hands."
31:42;31:44;"My hands out the cookie jar."
31:44;31:45;"OK, guys."
31:45;31:48;"We've got a very special guest who just joined us"
31:48;31:49;"in the studio."
31:49;31:50;"Longtime friend of Time Crisis."
31:50;31:52;"It's been a minute since you've been on."
31:52;31:54;"We've got Jerrod Carmichael."
31:54;31:55;"Hello, everyone."
31:55;31:56;"I like very special."
31:56;31:58;"They make me feel very special."
31:58;31:59;"You might be--"
31:59;32:00;"These words work."
32:00;32:02;"--the most frequent guest on Time Crisis."
32:02;32:03;"We kind of stopped having guests."
32:03;32:04;"Really?"
32:04;32:06;"Yeah, you got to do that sometimes."
32:06;32:08;"I stopped having guests in my personal life."
32:08;32:10;"So I get it."
32:10;32:11;"There's nobody comes--"
32:11;32:12;"It was just like, yeah, you know what?"
32:12;32:13;"I'm good."
32:13;32:15;"You look around at the crew you're around."
32:15;32:17;"You're like, yeah, I think we're good now."
32:17;32:19;"So I completely understand the sentiment behind that."
32:19;32:21;"You need alone time."
32:21;32:23;"So just real quick, what are you doing right now?"
32:23;32:26;"You making the next season of the show?"
32:26;32:29;"We start the room, the writers room, in like a couple months."
32:29;32:33;"So I'm just like shooting a movie and doing like--"
32:33;32:34;"OK."
32:34;32:37;"--writing a lot, doing a lot of stand-up."
32:37;32:39;"Stand-up is like number one."
32:39;32:40;"I'm really excited about it."
32:40;32:42;"Yeah, so just that, loitering."
32:42;32:44;"Well, we got one question for you"
32:44;32:46;"before we start talking about the songs of the summer."
32:46;32:47;"Yes."
32:47;32:49;"That's what we thought would be a good segment to do."
32:49;32:51;"Oh, I like that, songs of the summer."
32:51;32:53;"Before you got here, when we were killing time,"
32:53;32:55;"we did a cookie segment."
32:55;32:56;"Oh, man."
32:56;32:57;"And we were talking about cookies."
32:57;32:58;"I see the debris."
32:58;33:00;"And yeah, you see all these weird cookies."
33:00;33:03;"So we just want to ask you, because this kind of-- it"
33:03;33:05;"became a very passionate topic in the room."
33:05;33:08;"We were talking about these limited edition blueberry pie"
33:08;33:09;"Oreos."
33:09;33:10;"Jake was kind of disgusted by them."
33:10;33:12;"I was trying to think about the person"
33:12;33:13;"who might be excited by it."
33:13;33:15;"So when you come in to the studio"
33:15;33:18;"and you just see this package of limited edition blueberry pie"
33:18;33:20;"Oreos, what thoughts go through your head?"
33:20;33:23;"It's like, oh, man, there's like so much sadness here."
33:23;33:25;"It's so much-- it's like--"
33:25;33:26;"Thank you."
33:26;33:27;"--it's relief."
33:27;33:29;"I will say that like these types of food"
33:29;33:34;"are like heroin for people who can't commit to heroin."
33:34;33:36;"You know, you look for like excitement."
33:36;33:38;"And you look for these sparks of like--"
33:38;33:41;"when life is hard, you need blueberry pie Oreos."
33:41;33:44;"When regular Oreos don't do it."
33:44;33:46;"You know, like regular Oreos are just gateway Oreos."
33:46;33:48;"These are like when you're like--"
33:48;33:49;"you're maxed out."
33:49;33:51;"Like it's just like you're working three jobs."
33:51;33:52;"And it's just like, yeah, yeah, no, no."
33:52;33:54;"Double stuffed isn't enough."
33:54;33:57;"I need pie in my Oreos."
33:57;34:00;"Because when life is hard, you need that excitement."
34:00;34:02;"When I'm at like a really wealthy person's house,"
34:02;34:04;"their snacks are boring."
34:04;34:06;"Bags of granola."
34:06;34:09;"You know, because like for a really rich person,"
34:09;34:12;"their equivalent of like that special two weeks in August"
34:12;34:15;"when you bring home the blueberry pie Oreos, for them,"
34:15;34:16;"it's going on a trip."
34:16;34:18;"Yeah, you go to San Tropez."
34:18;34:19;"Yeah, it literally is like--"
34:19;34:20;"That's your blueberry Oreo."
34:20;34:22;"I'm so bored of San Tropez."
34:22;34:25;"Maybe this time, let's go to Tahiti."
34:25;34:27;"Yeah, that's a jolt of excitement."
34:27;34:29;"And I'm not trying to rich shame."
34:29;34:31;"Everybody needs variety in life."
34:31;34:33;"But when you do need that burst of excitement,"
34:33;34:36;"if I can't make it to a bakery, and I'm not really around"
34:36;34:38;"bakeries, I'm going to get some blueberry pie Oreo."
34:38;34:39;"Maybe."
34:39;34:41;"If I need a hit, man."
34:41;34:44;"Like, you know, if I'm fiending for like a thing--"
34:44;34:46;"If there's no farmer's market where you can get a fresh"
34:46;34:48;"baked blueberry pie to bring home on Sunday."
34:48;34:49;"Yeah, farmer's market."
35:00;35:07;"You run with your dreams of gun, and stars are made of running away, and hiding before they come."
35:25;35:34;"You want a place to stand still, a place to cure your ills, a place to save your face and keep you calm when you're uphill."
35:34;35:43;"You'll never be the best, she'll never turn you on, and stars are made from running away and hiding where you're from."
35:43;35:52;"Don't use my name, it makes me wonder, will I ever be enough?"
35:53;36:02;"Don't call again, I couldn't answer, my reaction says it all."
36:02;36:08;"She's chasing me, by the eyes of makeup."
36:08;36:19;"Chasing what you live for, it's never what you need, you're a liar."
36:20;36:27;"How could you know if yours would free your passion from another?"
36:27;36:38;"Do you ever think more, or does it just feel better? No."
36:38;36:45;"Feeling the comfort of sensing the peace that also remains."
36:46;36:48;"What are those Newtons?"
36:48;36:49;"Those are just fig Newtons."
36:49;36:50;"Those are just regular fig Newtons."
36:50;36:51;"What's your take on fig Newtons?"
36:51;36:53;"The illusion of health in a cookie?"
36:53;36:54;"The illusion of health."
36:54;36:55;"The illusion because fig--"
36:55;36:56;"Yeah, they're probably not healthy."
36:56;36:59;"Yeah, of course not, but fig sounds biblical almost."
36:59;37:00;"It's got fiber."
37:00;37:01;"Right."
37:01;37:02;"Oh yeah."
37:02;37:03;"You actually--"
37:03;37:09;"I can definitely speak for myself, and I grew up with relatively--my parents wanted to eat organic and stuff."
37:09;37:16;"I probably had 1,000 to 2,000 fig Newtons in my life before I ever saw a fig."
37:16;37:17;"Yeah, oh yeah."
37:17;37:18;"Sure."
37:18;37:19;"I ate my first fig last year."
37:19;37:20;"Really?"
37:20;37:22;"Yeah, and someone gave it to me as a gift at Hopewood."
37:22;37:29;"It was like he could see the inner city youth in my eyes, and was just like, ""Here, son. This is the real version of it."""
37:29;37:31;"A fresh fig is very good."
37:31;37:32;"Yeah."
37:32;37:34;"I mean, Jesus was all about it in the Bible."
37:34;37:35;"That's right."
37:35;37:38;"The thing is with fig--there has to be--you said there's fiber."
37:38;37:42;"There has to be a good and bad version of fiber."
37:42;37:49;"There has to be a healthy Gala apple version of fiber, and then there's the Captain Pollution version."
37:49;38:00;"It's like one eases through your system, one completely disrupts and destroys everything in its wake, and that version of fiber is just a path of destruction."
38:00;38:07;"I think it's the same way that they started selling Doritos and being like, ""Three grams of protein."""
38:07;38:17;"Whatever people got obsessed with fiber, protein, Omega-3s, they could just look at the thing and be like, ""Our disgusting thing has a tiny bit of fiber, tiny bit of
protein."""
38:17;38:19;"You just flip it, and you market it, and then--"
38:19;38:20;"Kale."
38:20;38:22;"Now there's some kale."
38:22;38:24;"But that's what I'm saying. Can you see kale Doritos?"
38:24;38:26;"Yo, how does that not exist?"
38:26;38:29;"Oh, my God. Because those are two different audiences."
38:29;38:31;"Two completely different audiences."
38:31;38:38;"But it is like the fiber in an apple is like--it passes things through your system the way someone crowd surfs."
38:38;38:43;"It's just a very delicate--let's move them along, and then the fiber in a Fig Newton is a bullet."
38:43;38:44;"Right, right."
38:44;38:47;"You could shoot through an intestine."
38:47;38:49;"There's fiber in a seven-layer burrito from Taco Bell."
38:49;38:50;"Yeah, for sure."
38:50;38:51;"And protein."
38:51;38:53;"And that's going to pass right through."
38:53;38:54;"Yeah, it's going to pass through."
38:54;38:55;"Oh, yeah."
38:55;38:57;"There's protein in a birthday cake Oreo."
38:57;38:59;"Wow. Birthday cake."
38:59;39:00;"Think about that."
39:00;39:03;"I'm looking at the less than one gram."
39:03;39:05;"Take a second, though."
39:05;39:07;"And a darker thought."
39:07;39:12;"Think of who eats birthday cake Oreos on their birthday."
39:12;39:13;"That's rough."
39:13;39:14;"That's a rough birthday."
39:14;39:15;"You know, it's like--"
39:15;39:17;"It's like, ""How was the divorce?"""
39:17;39:19;"[laughter]"
39:19;39:21;"Have you seen your children?"
39:21;39:30;"We've painted a lot of dark pictures of the kind of horrific, unequal, brutal, capitalistic American society in our cookie episode."
39:30;39:45;"But I didn't actually get depressed until you painted the picture of the solo person at the supermarket getting whatever they're going to eat for dinner and then just
be like, ""Well, it is my birthday,"" and just grabbing them."
39:45;39:51;"Like, everything else was already just kind of rough, but that really gets me."
39:51;39:52;"It's heavy."
39:52;39:54;"That's like Paul Giamatti plays that role."
39:54;39:55;"Oh, yeah."
39:55;39:57;"In the ""Alexander the Pain"" film."
39:57;39:58;"Yeah."
39:58;39:59;"Oh, my God."
39:59;40:04;"Only he could just, with his eyes, convey the lost, hopeless emotion that one would reach for Oreo."
40:04;40:07;"Yeah, he's just looking back and forth between the regular Oreo and the birthday cake."
40:07;40:08;"He buys both."
40:08;40:09;"Yeah, buys both."
40:09;40:10;"Checks out."
40:10;40:12;"This is for my birthday, and these are for tomorrow."
40:12;40:19;"That reminds me a similar lesson I learned about corporate food products and depression."
40:19;40:22;"When I was a kid, I have this memory--"
40:22;40:23;"That sounds like a course."
40:23;40:25;"That sounds like a course at--"
40:25;40:27;"Yeah, I'm at UCLA."
40:27;40:29;"Yeah, UCLA, corporate food products and depression."
40:29;40:31;"And depression in the Western literary tradition."
40:31;40:33;"That's like a pamphlet in your therapist's office."
40:33;40:35;"They're closer than you think."
40:35;40:43;"I have this memory of on Thanksgiving Day, the supermarkets open, maybe rolling with my dad."
40:43;40:46;"Mom was like, ""Oh, we need some more potatoes or something."""
40:46;40:50;"And just being there and just seeing at a local Domino's--"
40:50;40:52;"The Domino's used to sometimes make sandwiches."
40:52;40:54;"I don't know if it was a unique chain thing."
40:54;40:59;"But I just remember walking past the Domino's on Thanksgiving Day, seeing some people inside."
40:59;41:04;"And already being, whatever, I was 10, 11, 12, just being like, ""Oh, I guess some people go to Domino's on Thanksgiving."""
41:04;41:06;"I guess--"
41:06;41:08;"Oh, yeah, well, I guess not everybody has a family or something."
41:08;41:16;"And then seeing a sign that was like, ""Domino's Thanksgiving Special, turkey sub and one liter soda."""
41:16;41:18;"I just remember as a kid being like--"
41:18;41:22;"Just, again, having that same picture of it's a special occasion."
41:22;41:27;"But you're just paying this kind of weak homage to it."
41:27;41:33;"That special should also come with a card apologizing for the fire that destroyed your family."
41:33;41:35;"Yeah."
43:53;44:07;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
44:07;44:11;"I do wonder, what does Jason Bourne do on Thanksgiving?"
44:11;44:13;"That's a good question."
44:13;44:15;"What does he do? Because he is--"
44:15;44:22;"The realistic version of the Bourne identity is him alone on Thanksgiving at that Domino's."
44:22;44:24;"Or in Prague."
44:24;44:26;"Yeah, he's in Thailand."
44:26;44:30;"He's in Thailand. Because it's not fun, he's literally always running."
44:30;44:33;"Being in another country is kind of glamorous, I guess."
44:33;44:37;"Like, ""Happy Thanksgiving, Jason."" He's like, ""Didn't even notice."""
44:37;44:44;"But yeah, like the dude with the Donnie Brosco, the undercover cop."
44:44;44:47;"Who's just by himself, I don't know."
44:47;44:50;"By himself, just eating Thanksgiving Oreos."
44:50;44:52;"Pumpkin Oreos."
44:52;44:56;"And we think for a second, that's not a thing."
44:56;44:58;"Time Crisis got dark again, man."
44:58;44:59;"I really feel--"
44:59;45:00;"Existential."
45:00;45:06;"I do think it's a public health thing that we got to take more care of lonely people."
45:06;45:10;"Yeah, the Eleanor Rigby's of the world deserve more than--"
45:10;45:13;"If I was president, Eleanor Rigby initiative."
45:13;45:16;"I truly think you got to fight poverty, you also got to fight loneliness."
45:16;45:18;"You got to give people a reason to live."
45:18;45:19;"Just surviving--"
45:19;45:22;"There should be a speed dating version of Thanksgiving dinner, though."
45:22;45:24;"Like a blind--"
45:24;45:26;"That's a great idea, actually."
45:26;45:32;"The unfortunate go to shelters, the people with families go there, and the lonely people go to the speed dating."
45:32;45:36;"We're not talking about people who have been stricken, like the house burned down, lost their job."
45:36;45:40;"We're just talking about people who maybe are fine, lower middle class people."
45:40;45:41;"They just don't know anybody."
45:41;45:44;"Those people should get to have a sense of community, too."
45:44;45:46;"I could totally see it."
45:46;45:48;"Maybe this is just me accepting being an adult."
45:48;45:52;"I could totally see a world where you look up and you just don't have any friends."
45:52;45:55;"Where you've just been working and you just look up and no real friends."
45:55;45:59;"You have people you know, but I could see a world where you just--"
45:59;46:00;"Life swept you away."
46:00;46:03;"How many people have children primarily just to avoid that?"
46:03;46:06;"Yeah, I think that's the point of marriage."
46:06;46:10;"The fear of loneliness, I think, is the number one cause of marriage."
46:10;46:12;"I'm saying it like it's an illness."
46:12;46:14;"[laughter]"
46:14;46:17;"The number one cause of marriage cancer is loneliness."
46:17;46:20;"Obama, you start the Eleanor Rigby initiative."
46:20;46:22;"We could get those marriage numbers down."
46:22;46:23;"We can get marriage numbers way down."
46:23;46:27;"Because divorce is up because most people realize that marriage is a mistake."
46:27;46:32;"But at the same time, it's like you wouldn't need to even do it if you weren't so terrified."
46:32;46:34;"I think marriage numbers are down."
46:34;46:35;"Are they?"
46:35;46:38;"I remember hearing somewhere like for the first time ever in history,"
46:38;46:41;"over 50% of the population was single."
46:41;46:42;"Oh, wow."
46:42;46:43;"Isn't that crazy?"
46:43;46:44;"Wow."
46:44;46:45;"Are people still pairing off, though?"
46:45;46:46;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
46:46;46:49;"It meant like maritally, like technically single."
46:49;46:52;"Like on my tax return, it's single still, even though I'm not single."
46:52;46:53;"You have a long-term girlfriend."
46:53;46:54;"Yeah."
46:54;46:56;"You have somebody to do Thanksgiving with."
46:56;46:57;"Yeah."
46:57;46:58;"All right."
46:58;46:59;"Quit bragging."
46:59;47:00;"[laughter]"

48:06;48:10;"because I was at lunch the other day with a friend of mine,"
48:10;48:12;"and then he left the table for a little while,"
48:12;48:15;"and my battery died on my phone,"
48:15;48:18;"and I was just alone in a restaurant."
48:18;48:20;"'Cause now, like, think about 20 years ago."
48:20;48:24;"Like, 20 years ago, you were just alone in a restaurant."
48:24;48:27;"Like, now, your phone, you're never really alone."
48:27;48:30;"You at least have the illusion of being connected"
48:30;48:33;"and around people, but like, he left and my battery's dead,"
48:33;48:34;"and I was like, oh, I'm just--"
48:34;48:36;"- Did you pretend to look at your phone so people wouldn't--"
48:36;48:38;"- No, I was a-- - What did you do?"
48:38;48:41;"- 'Cause we were done eating, so I was just,"
48:41;48:44;"you don't know what to do with your eyes."
48:44;48:45;"Where do you focus this,"
48:45;48:47;"like, you don't know what to do with your eyes."
48:47;48:49;"And it was my first time noticing the restaurant."
48:49;48:51;"I was very Eckhart Tolle in the moment."
48:51;48:52;"I was right there, but--"
48:52;48:54;"- But was it a positive feeling?"
48:54;48:56;"You looked around and you were just like,"
48:56;48:57;"life's beautiful. - I went through"
48:57;49:00;"every stage of emotion that you could imagine."
49:00;49:02;"Like, it was complete fear and anxiety."
49:02;49:03;"There was denial. - Denial."
49:03;49:03;"- No, no, no, no, no."
49:03;49:06;"There was denial, where I kept trying to turn my phone on."
49:06;49:08;"There was like, he didn't go to the bathroom."
49:08;49:09;"He's back any second."
49:09;49:11;"Like, there's denial, there's fear,"
49:11;49:14;"there's all of these emotions that just run through you."
49:14;49:16;"And then there's acceptance of like,"
49:16;49:19;"I am alone at this table, and here we are."
49:19;49:20;"Look at the architecture. - You know what?"
49:20;49:22;"Before we get into the summer songs,"
49:22;49:23;"because I love this conversation,"
49:23;49:26;"and I love that it's all stemming from the limited edition"
49:26;49:28;"blueberry pie Oreos, check 'em out."
49:29;49:31;"This is a question I always think that,"
49:31;49:33;"we've probably talked about this on Tom Crisis before,"
49:33;49:34;"maybe we haven't."
49:34;49:37;"How many times have you eaten dinner"
49:37;49:39;"at a restaurant by yourself?"
49:39;49:42;"- I probably do it more often than the average person"
49:42;49:45;"because I'm like, out of town, on the road a lot."
49:45;49:46;"- Define restaurant."
49:46;49:48;"It's like a taqueria?"
49:48;49:50;"- No, like-- - With like, fluorescent light."
49:50;49:50;"- No, I'm talking-- - Okay, like a restaurant."
49:50;49:52;"- I'm talking with waiter service."
49:52;49:54;"- Waiter service, where you're not just at the bar,"
49:54;49:55;"'cause at the bar-- - Like, how can I help you?"
49:55;49:57;"Table for one."
49:57;49:58;"- Yeah. - Okay, your server"
49:58;49:59;"will be right with you. - Okay."
49:59;50:01;"- There's always a moment where they squint"
50:01;50:03;"and they go, ""Just you?"""
50:03;50:05;"- Right. - And it's with concern."
50:05;50:06;"It's with slight concern."
50:06;50:08;"- I know, our society doesn't take care of lonely people."
50:08;50:10;"- I do it, like, if I'm in a town"
50:10;50:12;"that doesn't have Postmates,"
50:12;50:14;"you know what I mean?"
50:14;50:16;"Like, and I actually want like a meal,"
50:16;50:18;"then I'll go to a restaurant and I'll sit there,"
50:18;50:21;"and you know, I mean, and again,"
50:21;50:23;"with the phone you can do, you know, emails"
50:23;50:24;"and stuff like that, but even--"
50:24;50:26;"- I almost feel like that, okay, but in--"
50:26;50:27;"- In town. - In your hometown."
50:27;50:31;"- Oh, the true gauge of who your true friends are"
50:31;50:33;"and how you feel about someone is"
50:33;50:36;"when you're scrambling to look for someone to eat with."
50:36;50:39;"That's the truest gauge, and you just go"
50:39;50:41;"and you just go down the list,"
50:41;50:42;"and then you go by area, I'm here,"
50:42;50:44;"like, if you have weird amount of time"
50:44;50:46;"and not enough time to go home,"
50:46;50:48;"and then you're just looking for someone to eat with,"
50:48;50:49;"and it's just like, who--"
50:49;50:51;"- 'Cause there's some people that you actually get to"
50:51;50:54;"and you're like, ""I wouldn't even wanna eat with you."""
50:54;50:57;"- Yeah, but maybe it's easy, the worst."
50:58;50:59;"- Right. - Let's see at lunch."
50:59;51:01;"- Oh man, this made me think about in college."
51:01;51:02;"- Yeah? - That's a weird one,"
51:02;51:05;"when you first get to college and you gotta go eat,"
51:05;51:07;"and it's like, yeah, just like--"
51:07;51:08;"- The tray? - Holding the tray"
51:08;51:10;"and just being like-- - Yeah, but is it really"
51:10;51:11;"like that, like, where you just walk in and--"
51:11;51:14;"- Yeah, at Columbia, it was like a beautiful,"
51:14;51:17;"almost like Hogwarts-style dining hall,"
51:17;51:19;"and you just like kinda roll in"
51:19;51:20;"and you see people like laughing."
51:20;51:22;"It literally was like in a high school,"
51:22;51:23;"it didn't happen in high school to me,"
51:23;51:26;"'cause we went to this small school, I had my friends,"
51:26;51:28;"but then at college, sometimes you look around"
51:28;51:30;"and you're like, it really didn't come naturally to me."
51:30;51:32;"I was like, wait, am I literally,"
51:32;51:33;"I'm talking about the first week,"
51:33;51:35;"it's like you look around, you see some people"
51:35;51:37;"look like they're having a great time,"
51:37;51:39;"and you're like, ""Ah, I don't know the middle,"""
51:39;51:40;"and then you look around, you're like,"
51:40;51:41;"""Don't see your roommate,"
51:41;51:43;"""don't see your handful of people,"""
51:43;51:46;"you know, and you're like, ""That guy's in my seminar."
51:46;51:50;"""Am I literally gonna just sit down and be like,"
51:50;51:54;"""Hey man, we're in Professor whatever's class together."""
51:54;51:56;"- Mm-hmm. - Oh, oh yeah."
51:56;51:58;"- How's it going, good?"
51:58;52:02;"- The only group that actually does that are celebrities."
52:02;52:05;"Celebrities will do that to each other."
52:05;52:06;"I like watching, it's my favorite thing."
52:06;52:07;"- When they've never met before?"
52:07;52:08;"- When they've never met before,"
52:08;52:10;"I like to imagine a conversation starting,"
52:10;52:13;"it's like, ""Hey, you don't film in television?"""
52:13;52:15;"I'm like, ""I do film in television."""
52:15;52:18;"And it's just like an immediate kind of trust"
52:18;52:19;"in a room full of whatever,"
52:19;52:21;"I've seen it happen so many times,"
52:21;52:25;"just like the only two known people in a room"
52:25;52:27;"just find each other."
52:27;52:28;"- Yeah."
52:28;52:30;"- It's just like, oh, because there's at least that"
52:30;52:33;"to connect with, but you should be able to do it."
52:33;52:34;"It's just like with anything."
52:34;52:36;"- Regular people should do that too."

55:19;55:21;"- It's always funny you just talk to a stranger."
55:21;55:23;"- People-- - Just like, just walk,"
55:23;55:25;"just approach the stranger. - You know, it's a controversial"
55:25;55:29;"topic because some people find it like invasive"
55:29;55:31;"if a stranger comes and talks to them."
55:31;55:33;"I mean, we live in a scary world, so some people"
55:33;55:35;"would be like, saying hi to somebody you don't know"
55:35;55:37;"is aggressive. - That's the whole point."
55:37;55:40;"Your mourning should be spent, and it essentially"
55:40;55:43;"is making yourself presentable to strangers."
55:43;55:45;"Like, that's the reason you put on your jacket"
55:45;55:47;"and you comb your hair and then you go--"
55:47;55:49;"so if I have to approach a stranger today,"
55:49;55:52;"they will not be completely freaked out."
55:52;55:56;"They will not be completely turned off and disgusted"
55:56;55:59;"by the notion that I would even speak to them."
55:59;56:02;"- Right, but that's like a situation where it's like--"
56:02;56:04;"so you dropped your scarf. - Yeah."
56:04;56:06;"- Versus, like, at, like, the coffee shop."
56:06;56:08;"- What's up? - What's up?"
56:08;56:10;"- Man, you hear about John Galliano?"
56:10;56:12;"- [laughs] - Oh, you didn't?"
56:12;56:15;"I don't know. - I'm jealous of babies"
56:15;56:18;"when I see babies just stare at someone."
56:18;56:20;"'Cause you want to do that constantly."
56:20;56:22;"You always look for the excuse to look at someone"
56:22;56:24;"or to stare at someone, but baby's just, like,"
56:24;56:26;"looking over its mother's shoulder"
56:26;56:28;"and just staring at you, just figuring out"
56:28;56:30;"what is this face-- - Learning."
56:30;56:32;"- Just learning, like, and I wish we could do--"
56:32;56:34;"I want to do that to people constantly."
56:34;56:36;"There's a girl in the next studio that I'm avoiding"
56:36;56:38;"doing that to now."
56:38;56:40;"I just keep wanting to stare-- there's a girl"
56:40;56:42;"in the Mickey Mouse sweatshirt that is stare-adable."
56:42;56:45;"- She's gonna feel weird if people are staring at her."
56:45;56:47;"- She should! She should! She should."
56:47;56:49;"And I shouldn't be-- I'm staring at her now,"
56:49;56:51;"and I shouldn't be doing that."
56:51;56:53;"- We have a responsibility as humans,"
56:53;56:56;"and especially as men, to neutralize our gaze."
56:56;56:58;"- Yeah. - I don't know."
56:58;57:00;"- I don't want to be that guy. You don't want to be that guy."
57:00;57:02;"- And sometimes it's as simple as just, like,"
57:02;57:04;"not leaving people alone. - Yeah."
57:04;57:06;"- [sighs] - Guys."
57:06;57:08;"- Look, the loneliness deficit,"
57:08;57:10;"it's not gonna get solved overnight."
57:10;57:13;"- You have to read this book-- I just read this book"
57:13;57:15;"called ""Tribe."" - Mm-hmm."
57:15;57:17;"- It's an excellent book, and it just talks about,"
57:17;57:19;"you know, essentially our need to belong"
57:19;57:22;"and how a lot of the things in our lives"
57:22;57:24;"and the things that we work for"
57:24;57:27;"actually work against our innate need to belong."
57:27;57:29;"You know, like, we used to-- - Oh, it's like"
57:29;57:31;"a sociological type thing? - Yeah, and how we were"
57:31;57:33;"a part of tribes, and everyone was kind of"
57:33;57:36;"a part of tribe, and then the biggest change in history"
57:36;57:39;"was the ability to essentially be self-sufficient"

01:56:54;01:56:55;"Tooth song?"
01:56:55;01:56:58;"We all understand that it's global pop."
01:56:58;01:56:59;"Right."
01:56:59;01:57:01;"And it's made by people who are spread out across the world."
01:57:01;01:57:03;"And also, when you think about this song,"
01:57:03;01:57:05;"it might even make sense that they're not in the same place."
01:57:05;01:57:06;"Yeah, you're right."
01:57:06;01:57:07;"Maybe it's deliberate."
01:57:07;01:57:09;"Apologies to the chain smokers for implying"
01:57:09;01:57:12;"that it would have been anything other than artistic choice."
01:57:12;01:57:13;"No, but I like this song."
01:57:13;01:57:14;"It's cool."
01:57:14;01:57:15;"It's corny, but it's cool."
01:57:15;01:57:17;"Do you think it takes place in Colorado?"
01:57:17;01:57:19;"Because they say your roommate back in Boulder."
01:57:19;01:57:21;"Are they, like, in Denver now?"
01:57:21;01:57:22;"Where are the chain smokers from?"
01:57:22;01:57:23;"Good question."
01:57:23;01:57:24;"I'm guessing Los Angeles."
01:57:24;01:57:26;"Golden, Colorado-based band."
01:57:26;01:57:29;"The chain smokers started in New York."
01:57:29;01:57:30;"New York City?"
01:57:30;01:57:31;"Yeah."
01:57:31;01:57:32;"I wonder where they're from, though."
01:57:32;01:57:33;"Andrew Taggart."
01:57:33;01:57:34;"These guys know what they're doing."
01:57:34;01:57:37;"They're really, like-- they're making a lot of big hits."
01:57:37;01:57:40;"They have three-- and if this song goes platinum,"
01:57:40;01:57:42;"they'll have four platinum singles."
01:57:42;01:57:43;"Terrible band name."
01:57:43;01:57:45;"Chain smokers?"
01:57:45;01:57:46;"Yeah, but you know--"
01:57:46;01:57:47;"Weird name."
01:57:47;01:57:48;"--the Beatles was a bad name, too."
01:57:48;01:57:50;"So was the Rolling Stones."
01:57:50;01:57:52;"Rolling Stones was a tight name."
01:57:52;01:57:53;"No, it's stupid."
01:57:53;01:57:55;"What, just a stone rolling down a mountain?"
01:57:55;01:57:58;"That's supposed to make me want to-- at least chain smoking"
01:57:58;01:57:59;"is, like, badass."
01:57:59;01:58:02;"No, Rolling Stones is, like, a force of nature."
01:58:02;01:58:03;"It's, like, gravity itself."
01:58:03;01:58:04;"It's, like, elemental."
01:58:04;01:58:07;"Chain smoking is just, like, a terrible, outdated habit."
01:58:07;01:58:09;"You're not making any sense to me, dog."
01:58:09;01:58:10;"That's the top--"
01:58:10;01:58:12;"I'm not making sense."
01:58:12;01:58:13;"You're not making sense."
01:58:13;01:58:16;"I think you have one too many blueberry pie Oreos, my friend."
01:58:16;01:58:19;"Well, that was interesting, comparing the college charts"
01:58:19;01:58:21;"to the iTunes charts."
01:58:21;01:58:23;"One thing's for sure, there's a lot of great music"
01:58:23;01:58:24;"all over the place."
01:58:24;01:58:27;"Said with a straight face."
01:58:27;01:58:28;"No, I believe it."
01:58:28;01:58:30;"Thank you so much to our guest, Gerard Carmichael,"
01:58:30;01:58:31;"for coming through."
01:58:31;01:58:32;"That was epic."
01:58:32;01:58:33;"Always a pleasure."
01:58:33;01:58:35;"Make sure to go check it-- I mean, at this point,"
01:58:35;01:58:39;"where we have two seasons of ""The Carmichael Show,"""
01:58:39;01:58:40;"an HBO special."
01:58:40;01:58:41;"Oh, really?"
01:58:41;01:58:42;"You never saw his HBO special?"
01:58:42;01:58:43;"No, I should watch it."
01:58:43;01:58:44;"Yeah, Spike Lee directed it."
01:58:44;01:58:45;"I want to watch that tonight."
01:58:45;01:58:46;"Thanks for listening, guys."
01:58:46;01:58:49;"This has been an epic TC25."
01:58:49;01:58:51;"We're 50 hours deep."
01:58:51;01:58:54;"50 hours of good conversation."
01:58:54;01:58:56;"I hope everybody's doing well, and I"
01:58:56;01:58:58;"hope that for all the children and the adults,"
01:58:58;01:59:00;"you're not too bummed out by the fact"
01:59:00;01:59:02;"that school's about to start."
01:59:02;01:59:04;"And kids, you're going to go to school."
01:59:04;01:59:05;"You're going to have fun."
01:59:05;01:59:09;"The real victims out there are the grown men driving by,"
01:59:09;01:59:11;"just trying to have a chill morning drive,"
01:59:11;01:59:14;"and just seeing that sign, ""Back to school,"""
01:59:14;01:59:16;"just getting harshed out."
01:59:16;01:59:18;"Honestly, it's bull-- that shouldn't affect our lives."
01:59:18;01:59:21;"Why are we still forced to think in school terms?"
01:59:21;01:59:23;"We've been out of school, man."
01:59:23;01:59:25;"I left school in 10th grade, man."
01:59:25;01:59:30;"And I'm-- I still wake up September 6, want to puke."
01:59:30;01:59:32;"[laughs]"
01:59:32;01:59:33;"See you in two weeks."
01:59:33;01:59:34;"Beats 1."
01:59:34;01:59:35;"Worldwide."
01:59:35;01:59:36;"Always on."
