02:40;02:42;"malaise or or even"
02:43;02:47;"Anxiety about it. You're right. It is because of climate change and"
02:47;02:53;"people increasingly see a hot day, you know, perhaps for good reason as"
02:53;03:00;"Yeah a harbinger of their impending death and everybody else's death. But yeah, maybe that's a little bit extra"
03:00;03:03;"Yeah back in the days. It's just like you'd be looking like music"

03:30;03:34;"They don't want to hear a hot fun in the summertime song. They wanted summertime sadness"
03:34;03:36;"Kiss me hot before you go"

05:28;05:32;"mid 90s to 100 every day and"

06:16;06:19;"You're in the middle of it. It's sort of probably like that"
06:19;06:24;"But then you'll find this like respite for these years, you know, once your kids in like full school mode"
06:24;06:29;"You're like, oh man, those like weekdays are like chill and then summer just becomes can can be just a lot"

06:43;06:50;"I got this big-ass dog that normally wants to walk for miles you get him outside right now"
06:50;06:54;"He's just like will not move and it's just sort of say I don't know if I left the house today"

07:08;07:10;"But you know this, you know"
07:10;07:15;"The other thing that we've talked a lot about is I had a teacher or a professor in college that you I think you took"
07:15;07:20;"A class with as well. Yeah, the legendary and Douglas of Columbia University"
07:20;07:26;"It was just the best and we took a film noir. I took a film noir class. I've often referenced to you"
07:26;07:31;"I don't think on the show and it was like talking about New York versus LA noir and how in New York"
07:31;07:35;"It's all shadows and it's all the sit, you know, like it's all secret alleyways, you know"
07:35;07:38;"And and that's where the sinister stuff happens and in LA"
07:38;07:45;"Yeah, it's just pulled into a dark alleyway in New York City pulled into the darkness and in LA darkness is the enemy"
07:45;07:52;"Yeah, and in LA the Sun is the enemy that the Sun is so there's you can't it's so oppressive and it's so there's no"
07:52;07:57;"There's no shadows that it's just like everything is seen and when it's summertime, baby"
07:57;08:02;"Feel it feels sinister. Yeah, I feel you the sinister son of Southern, California"
08:02;08:05;"Mm-hmm the sinister son of Southern, California"
08:05;08:13;"Yeah, that's the classic LA noir is somebody like hold up in a house looking through Venetian blinds as"
08:13;08:17;"Like that bright harsh Sun creeps in"
08:17;08:22;"And soon he'll walk to his death because he thought he'd never feel this way again"
08:22;08:29;"If he goes back to the house then things will go from bad to worse what could he do?"
08:29;08:36;"He wants to remember things exactly as he left them on that funny day"
08:36;08:46;"And if there is something else beyond he isn't scared because it's bound to be less boring than today"
08:46;08:49;"Bound to be less boring than tomorrow"
08:49;09:10;"Hillary went to her death because she couldn't think of anything to say"
09:13;09:17;"Everybody thought that she was boring so they never listened anyway"
09:17;09:24;"Nobody was really saying anything of interest she fell asleep"
09:24;09:33;"She was into S&M and Bible studies not everyone's cup of tea she would admit to me"
09:33;09:40;"A cup of tea she would admit to no one a cup of tea. She would admit to me"
09:41;09:43;"a cup of tea she would admit to no one"
09:43;09:48;"Maybe you got to just try framing it as a"
09:48;09:54;"You know how there's like just like random dudes who are like into trains or like"
09:54;10:03;"Tornado chasers or something you got to become a heat junkie. Just wake up and just be like wow. We want triple digits"
10:03;10:05;"All right"
10:05;10:09;"Walking around with a little thermometer trying to get the hottest spot"
10:09;10:16;"Exactly. I guess that's like if you gotta like life is beautiful it for your kid. Just be like wake up, buddy. It's 104"
10:16;10:24;"You know taking photos every time my my phone says it's too hot, you know to operate"
10:24;10:27;"You know when the iPhone shuts down with a thermometer just getting psyched"
10:27;10:32;"Exactly. See if you can see if you can fry an egg on on your car"
10:32;10:39;"Do some like crazy stuff with well, don't kill bugs with a magnifying glass, but you could probably come up with a more humane"
10:40;10:41;"game to do with"
10:41;10:47;"Magnifying I don't see if you could set a piece of paper on fire in a bucket having to rebrand myself as a heat junkie"
10:47;10:49;"I like this. Yeah"
10:49;10:52;"Next to real heat junkie"
10:52;11:00;"I'm bringing back while we were by the way"
11:00;11:05;"Next time somebody's like being like, oh man, what a hot summer just be like"
11:06;11:13;"Yeah, real bummer. We almost made it up to 111. I was kind of disappointed. We topped out around 103"
11:13;11:18;"There's one day in August. We hit 103. I was I was hoping for like a 105 106. How about you?"
11:18;11:26;"How's your summer going? My summer has been great been here and there. I'm in New York City"
11:26;11:28;"back on the island"
11:28;11:30;"money making Manhattan, but"
11:30;11:33;"Wait, is that an old phrase?"
11:33;11:40;"Money making Manhattan. Yes, like early hip-hop. Okay, it's got you. Yeah, I feel like it was like the boogie down Bronx. Yeah"
11:40;11:49;"What would come again? But then it was money making man out of those places recently for some reason anyway, where I don't remember"
11:49;11:51;"I just I've heard it money making, Missouri"
11:51;11:58;"Money making Monrovia through the soybean industry. Yeah money making, Missouri"
11:59;12:01;"Absolutely"
12:01;12:30;"I love a"
12:30;12:32;"Bad"
12:32;12:34;"Like"
12:34;12:38;"Down like a penitentiary"
12:38;12:45;"She spreads her loving all over and when she gets home there's none left for me"
12:45;12:49;"Do it"
12:49;12:53;"Ratties on the microphone"
12:53;12:59;"All people in the dance to the three that will well qualified to represent the LBC"
12:59;13:01;"I"
13:01;13:13;"Love being on the East Coast in summer or because well, you know"
13:13;13:19;"I get to see friends and family and also I do feel spiritually connected to summer out here and"
13:19;13:22;"Recently I was in deep deep New York State"
13:22;13:28;"About as far as you can get from Manhattan like Western New York. Yeah deep Western, New York"
13:28;13:29;"and"
13:29;13:36;"I had some interesting experiences out there one of which I started because I this is actually turned into a bit of a TC experience"
13:36;13:44;"There was a little food mart near where I was, you know, just like a local kind of independent little mini mart"
13:44;13:46;"I noticed a few things"
13:46;13:53;"Some handwritten signs outside one of which was that like they had lots of kratom kratom. How do you say that?"
13:53;13:57;"Kratom not familiar. It's like a legal ish drug that"
13:58;14:00;"People are taking probably won't be legal forever"
14:00;14:05;"but the other thing that caught my eye at the front of this kind of quickie Mart was a"
14:05;14:11;"Handwritten sign that said fireball slushy. So of course I had to go find out what that was"
14:11;14:16;"It's just like one dude running the stores like what's up with the fire with fireball slushies and he's like"
14:16;14:20;"you know, I got my slush puppy machine and throw some fireball in there for you and"
14:20;14:26;"First thought in my head. I'm like, is that legal? Cuz like when I think of fireball, that's it's like whiskey"
14:27;14:31;"It's a type of hard alcohol. I guess I don't know that much about fireball. Do you guys know?"
14:31;14:35;"Yeah, I thought it was like this like a flavored, you know, like a spicy whiskey basically"
14:35;14:41;"Like a cinnamon, yeah liquor. Yeah, it's got like a devil breathing fire on it"
14:41;14:46;"So I'm kind of thinking like, you know, I wasn't like a pretty small town"
14:46;14:48;"so like maybe they got their own rules out there, but I was saying like"
14:48;14:55;"There's like something kind of like seemed a little bit like off about that. He's like, yeah, no problem"
14:55;14:59;"I'll make this slush puppy. You know, you pick your flavor slush puppy and I pour in the"
14:59;15:04;"Fireball and I'm like wait, don't you have to be like a bar to do that?"
15:04;15:10;"and I left and then I and then I kept thinking about it so like went back and had to try one and"
15:10;15:14;"He had this um a little plastic jug"
15:14;15:21;"Right by the cash register that's full of small bottles of fireball. Hmm, which has two amazing"
15:21;15:25;"slogans on the jug one was unleash the dragon and"
15:25;15:30;"The second one was fireball tastes like heaven burns like hell. I"
15:30;15:32;"Was like, okay"
15:32;15:37;"I like this and then you know, he's like, all right making a slush puppy with the classic slush puppy machine"
15:37;15:40;"you know with like that that cool dog would like the"
15:40;15:45;"Little beanie on and so he made one he'd like, you know"
15:45;15:52;"Pick your flavor and he'd pick I picked blue raspberry and he squirts that in and then he just reached into the jug took out"
15:52;15:56;"One of the little things of fireball and poured it in, you know, like an airplane sized bottle. Sure"
15:56;16:03;"You know, I was like, alright, thanks drank it insanely sweet bit cinnamon II, you know got a mild buzz"
16:03;16:08;"Maybe mostly from the sugar but I was like, okay, that was an interesting experience"
16:08;16:11;"I've never had a mixed drink at you know"
16:11;16:16;"A 7-eleven type place and I'm like thinking about that a lot and I wondered you know"
16:16;16:21;"Is this is this guy just kind of like doing his own weird thing? Is he gonna get in trouble for this?"
16:21;16:24;"I don't know, but then I looked it up and it turns out that"
16:24;16:31;"Yes, fireball as most people know it is a 33% alcohol whiskey"
16:31;16:37;"But they started selling these little bottles at like gas stations and mini-marts"
16:37;16:41;"That are not made out of whiskey. They're like"
16:41;16:44;"16% alcohol"
16:44;16:46;"like little malt beverages"
16:46;16:47;"hmm and"
16:47;16:52;"The packaging looks exactly the same and then it actually turns out that there's a class-action"
16:52;16:57;"Lawsuit against the fireball company because people were like this is false advertising"
16:57;17:02;"You have a well-known brand as a whiskey. You're selling these little bottles. It's only half the alcohol"
17:02;17:08;"It doesn't even have like the the main ingredient which is whiskey and they're popping up everywhere because a lot of these stores"
17:08;17:14;"I think that was confusing about a lot of these stores don't even have the license to sell hard alcohol. Mm-hmm"
17:14;17:19;"You know, they sell beer. All right, East Coast. The states are more uptight about"
17:19;17:24;"Liquor laws. Yeah, exactly. You got to go to a liquor store to get a bottle of whiskey, right?"
17:24;17:27;"So this is kind of started showing up at places. You normally wouldn't expect hard alcohol"
17:27;17:31;"So for all I know this is like a big trend fireball slushies"
17:32;17:38;"Uh, everywhere. So it's like a but if you just drank it straight it would would it taste like fireball, but it's actually I"
17:38;17:44;"Don't know what a malt like what is a malt liquor? Like I know that's like old English and stuff"
17:44;17:49;"I thought I was like Jason's a beer. I think it's just a way to produce alcohol. So I think"
17:49;17:56;"Malted alcohol is a way that they create alcohol for many of these weird new alcohol drinks"
17:56;18:03;"That malted liquor is the type of mass-market beer with a high alcohol content most closely associated with North America"
18:03;18:09;"Legally, it often includes any alcoholic beverage or it's any alcoholic beverage with 5% or more alcohol by volume"
18:09;18:13;"Made with malted barley. So it's like it is like a beer"
18:13;18:19;"Well, no, I think malt malt liquor is like a beer where they maybe add a bit or something"
18:19;18:20;"There's also malted"
18:20;18:21;"Alco they use malt"
18:21;18:27;"Malted barley to create the alcohol for all sorts of like random drinks because now you have we were in this era of just like"
18:27;18:29;"Alcohol drinks, you know"
18:29;18:35;"Like when we were talking about the rise of all these hard seltzers the white claws of the world and now"
18:35;18:40;"Wait, was it like Duncan is getting in the mix now? Yeah, there's a Duncan Donuts"
18:40;18:47;"like hard iced tea or something or hard hard mocha"
18:49;18:53;"Wait and they and they come in they come in a paper cup with the I mean it's spiked"
18:53;19:01;"I spiked iced coffees and iced teas like alcohol coffee in the same can that's that does not appeal"
19:01;19:06;"I mean, I think is your upper and your downer. I think that's like the for loco stuff, right?"
19:06;19:10;"Like it makes you insane because it wasn't for loco an energy drink with"
19:10;19:16;"Alcohol in it. Yeah. Yeah, they announced this a Duncan this hard Duncan news"
19:16;19:22;"People made a lot of jokes about like it's gonna be you need to call in the National Guard in Boston"
19:22;19:24;"that kind of stuff"
19:24;19:30;"The whole state of Massachusetts is gonna be so twisted all summer long"
19:30;19:35;"It's gonna be a real problem"
19:46;19:51;"For 17 long years"
19:51;20:00;"I spent all my money"
20:00;20:06;"On whiskey"
20:06;20:11;"And beer"
20:11;20:13;"I"
20:13;20:18;"Go to"
20:18;20:23;"Some hollow"
20:23;20:27;"And said"
20:27;20:31;"Of my still"
20:31;20:36;"And if whiskey"
20:39;20:41;"Don't kill me"
20:41;20:47;"And I don't know what will"
20:47;20:49;"I"
20:49;20:51;"Go to"
20:51;20:53;"I"
20:53;21:19;"Go to"
21:19;21:23;"Some bar room"
21:23;21:28;"And drink"
21:28;21:33;"With my friends"
21:33;21:37;"Well the women"
21:37;21:40;"Can't follow"
21:40;21:45;"And see what I spend"
21:48;21:52;"God bless them pretty women"
21:52;21:57;"They was mine"
21:57;22:02;"Their breath is"
22:02;22:05;"That sweet"
22:05;22:09;"They do"
22:09;22:16;"Only fine, but the thing is about all of these whether it's it's the hard Duncan's the white claws, whatever"
22:16;22:18;"back in our day"
22:18;22:22;"You normally would think of a mixed drink as being one of the standard"
22:22;22:27;"Alcohols mixed with something else so we have this naive question"
22:27;22:33;"Which is like oh what kind of alcohol like the same way if back in the day you go to a bar"
22:33;22:37;"You know somebody make a mixed drink you might say like oh, what kind of alcohol is in that?"
22:37;22:42;"Oh, yeah, it's actually it's rum or it's vodka or something these are not made out of rum or vodka or whiskey"
22:43;22:51;"The classics or tequila they're made out of just like the cheapest type of alcohol you can put in some it's just alcohol"
22:51;22:57;"It's sometimes it's derived from malted barley or something, but it's like you know it's new school"
22:57;23:01;"It's just like the cheapest type of alcohol they can put into it right and I think that's a little bit"
23:01;23:06;"What's going on with this these cheap little fireballs, and maybe that's why?"
23:07;23:13;"Maybe these people win their class-action lawsuit because if you have an expectation that you're drinking something with like traditionally made whiskey"
23:13;23:15;"And it's just like some cheap"
23:15;23:21;"Maybe synthetics not the white right word, but it like just the cheapest type of alcohol you can buy"
23:21;23:24;"You're gonna feel a little ripped off listen"
23:24;23:31;"I was buying those airplane sized bottles of the gas station upstate New York, and I thought I was buying the finest whiskey"
23:31;23:36;"They were retailing for a dollar ninety nine each. I feel ripped off"
23:36;23:42;"I was like I wonder if it's a lawsuit they they also have because you know they always have to like the lawyer has to"
23:42;23:44;"like list out the"
23:44;23:50;"You know frame things and like with like emotional distress and stuff like that and just be like right my client"
23:50;23:53;"drank five of these and"
23:53;23:57;"Was not remotely twisted yeah this the synthetic"
23:57;24:01;"You know barley alcoholic slurry not cutting it"
24:03;24:08;"The failure to get twisted that night led my client to severe emotional distress"
24:08;24:11;"Well there you go"
24:11;24:13;"Someone's doing the Lord's work taking on that case"
24:13;24:21;"Really swinging for the fences on that one. I still kind of wonder okay whiskey or not it was still an interesting"
24:21;24:25;"Experience just like watching the dude behind the counter. Yeah, it's like"
24:25;24:31;"Make a mixed drink so he didn't card you know you get carded still"
24:32;24:39;"Very rarely you get carded. No. I think my final carding is behind me some places"
24:39;24:45;"Yeah, some places just do it with everything right like I remember being the grocery store with my dad"
24:45;24:47;"And like we were buying a bunch of wine or something and they like carded my dad"
24:47;24:51;"He's just like really"
24:51;24:54;"Sorry, sir like yeah, well. I feel like this is a joke"
24:54;24:59;"I may have seen multiple times in TVs or movies where like somebody"
24:59;25:04;"Gets carded an older person gets carded and it's like can I see your ID you got and they're just like oh"
25:04;25:10;"You're making me feel so young. I'm actually you know 57 just like yes store policy"
25:10;25:16;"You know I feel like I have witnessed that and I think if you go homes and programs"
25:16;25:22;"I think if you go to like an AMC movie theater like someplace. That's like not normally"
25:22;25:28;"Like a liquor store bar. I've never not been carded or seen them card like my mom really"
25:28;25:31;"Yeah, places that are just like it's policy"
25:31;25:36;"Don't give us a hard time. Don't make don't make this cute. I've been over 21 for a very long time"
25:36;25:38;"Yeah, I know just did this is what we do okay?"
25:38;25:42;"We're not gonna have a cutesy little moment ma'am"
25:42;25:44;"You're old. I'm looking at your old"
25:44;25:52;"You're old. I know my boss is over there. Just just please pay me also when I was when I was in deep, New York"
25:52;25:54;"I went to a bar I"
25:54;26:00;"Might have been there on country music night, and I heard a cool song that I wanted to play for you guys"
26:00;26:04;"Some people in the bar really knew this song so this must be like must have been a big hit"
26:04;26:07;"10 15 years ago"
26:07;26:11;"The song I heard in the bar, which I don't think I'd ever heard before maybe you guys have"
26:11;26:16;"Is by Craig Morgan it's called international harvester"
26:16;26:22;"I know I'm I know my country music, and I don't think I know this one"
26:23;26:27;"And it was like because where I was is kind of surrounded by farmland"
26:27;26:31;"So then I was like oh is this just like farmer country, and then I looked it up"
26:31;26:34;"It's like no this is like crossover country. It's about farming"
26:34;26:38;"Like when I got to the chorus like five people in the bar were yelling"
26:38;26:46;"I've been married ten years to the farmers daughter"
26:48;26:53;"I'm a God-fearing hard-working combine driver hogging up the road and whopper popper flower"
26:53;26:56;"It's heavy like a lugging five miles an hour"
26:56;26:59;"on my international"
26:59;27:01;"harvester"
27:01;27:06;"International harvesters like the company's a miles cars laying all their horns"
27:06;27:11;"Falling on deaf ears a corn"
27:11;27:16;"Lined up behind me like a big parade"
27:16;27:23;"I've laid to work road rage jerk shouting obscene words flipping me the bird"
27:23;27:31;"Well you may be on the state paper"
27:31;27:36;"But that black top runs through my payload"
27:36;27:42;"Excuse me for trying to do my job, but this year ain't been no"
27:44;27:47;"To be a long time to really understand this is song is about eat"
27:47;27:53;"If you don't like the way, I'm a driving get back on the interstate"
27:53;27:58;"Otherwise sit tight and be nice and quit you honking and me that away"
27:58;28:04;"He's on the highway driving his he's not on the highway"
28:04;28:10;"No, he's on the street like that people are honking on the road. He's on the road trying to drive his"
28:11;28:15;"Piece of giant farm machinery down the road and everyone's talking behind"
28:15;28:24;"But I'm proud to say I'm a god-fearing hard-working combine driver"
28:24;28:28;"Flower"
28:28;28:40;"Yeah, he's chugga-lugga-lugga in five miles an hour, but this is also from the point of view of the harvester"
28:41;28:46;"Like this is because international harvester is the company so this is from the point of view of the plow"
28:46;28:56;"No, he says he's I'm on my international on on an international harvester"
28:56;28:59;"Yes, it's not Transformers"
28:59;29:09;"Transformers, but I would have been just sort of like a metaphorical leap that it could make and you're right"
29:09;29:11;"It's both because like this could also be the third generation"
29:11;29:16;"Like this this plow has been giving three generations of farmers"
29:16;29:18;"Like action like this is like an old truck"
29:18;29:27;"I don't like it as much but again, I"
29:27;29:31;"Love it. I love that. He's on the on the side of the road"
29:31;29:36;"Like I mean we've all been on like little farm roads and had to go around swerve around a dude driving a huge"
29:36;29:40;"Come to combine, but I love his vibe is like get on the interstate man. If you're in a hurry"
29:40;29:43;"I'm sorry that I'm in your way, but that's what the freeways"
29:43;29:57;"Five miles an hour"
29:57;30:01;"Yeah, and when I said I didn't like it as much I just there was a moment"
30:01;30:05;"I was really into the idea of him writing it from the point of view of the machine"
30:05;30:12;"I love the idea. I love the idea that it is a transform. Actually that game has anybody ever tried to make like farmer Transformers"
30:12;30:16;"I think you're gonna say has anyone ever written a song from the perspective of a transformer"
30:16;30:19;"probably"
30:19;30:24;"Optimus Prime yeah"
30:24;30:28;"Decepticon so Tigra so so this one off in the bar you're saying yeah"
30:28;30:32;"Well, it was the bar was pretty empty, but I'm like listening to the song"
30:32;30:35;"I'm like kind of tapping my foot and I heard the beginning where it's like I hear the sky"
30:35;30:41;"I'm a god-fearing third-generation farmer and maybe because I was in a place that I'm not at that much a"
30:41;30:46;"Small town surrounded by farmland. I was like oh, this is like a farmer song"
30:46;30:50;"And then I just saw people going on minute like I saw just a few people yelling out"
30:50;30:54;"I'm an international harvester, so I was like okay. What is this song and"
30:54;30:57;"when I first heard it in the bar I"
30:58;31:03;"Mostly just uh you know hearing that opening line. I was like oh, this is like a guy"
31:03;31:06;"Just kind of being like I'm a proud farmer"
31:06;31:10;"Which is what the chorus is kind of art, but then I didn't realize that actually yeah"
31:10;31:13;"He's a proud farmer, but this is like a song about a situation"
31:13;31:17;"Which is that he's on he's on the country road"
31:17;31:18;"He's doing his job"
31:18;31:24;"And all these people all these jerks are just so annoyed that he's going five miles an hour"
31:24;31:28;"And they have to get to work and stuff, and he's just like man. I don't give a shit"
31:28;31:31;"I'm a proud farmer, and you know what this has been a hard year"
31:31;31:36;"It was not a bumper crop this year. Just shut up. It's like get on the interstate"
31:36;31:42;"He's doing the fall harvest and there's all these looky-loos out from the city out there to see the like fall foliage colors"
31:42;31:48;"Right and they're just like in a hurry to like get you know to the scenic overlook to see all the orange and red trees"
31:48;31:55;"Yep, they got a reservation at the farm to table restaurant. They're saying that a cute little Airbnb for the"
31:55;32:01;"Take for a week, and he's just like this is my life out here. Well, and then it's some of them"
32:01;32:03;"He has some sympathy"
32:03;32:05;"he says"
32:05;32:10;"Well, I know you got your own deadline, but cussing me won't save you no time haas"
32:10;32:14;"Yeah, this big wheel wide load ain't going any faster"
32:14;32:17;"so just smile and wave and tip your hat to the man on the tractor and"
32:17;32:20;"then I watched the video and"
32:21;32:27;"Of course, you know when they have to show like the different people caught behind it there's some kind of just like"
32:27;32:30;"annoying businessman and"
32:30;32:32;"In a convertible just like oh, come on"
32:32;32:40;"For sake I got to get to work. So it is I guess it also just makes the song way funnier"
32:40;32:42;"Cuz like you could imagine a kind of like serious"
32:42;32:49;"Song where the guy's just like I'm proud to be a farmer. I got my kids have you in the 4-h Club?"
32:49;32:51;"Yeah, I'm married to a woman from a forget go to hell"
32:51;32:57;"whereas then suddenly he's like painting this just like comical picture where the guys just got now it now I kind of like"
32:57;32:59;"That's because at first I'm like, oh, what who is this guy?"
32:59;33:03;"Yeah, what's he so angry about and then you're kind of like then I'm just picture him going five miles an hour"
33:03;33:09;"And he's just kind of like yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm doing my job. All right"
33:09;33:12;"This is this is just like a funny moment in time"
33:12;33:18;"And there's also something extra good about that the the company that makes the combine is called international harvester"
33:18;33:23;"But also like he could not be describing a more local story. Yeah"
33:23;33:26;"It couldn't be more just like"
33:26;33:29;"Yep, I don't leave the farm much you're on my little street"
33:29;33:34;"Go to hell. Well, like what you said is it's also like really great advice"
33:34;33:39;"Right for the guy behind the guy cut up and say hey chill out"
33:39;33:44;"You got nowhere to be it reminds me of a recent essay from a friend of the show"
33:44;33:50;"Jonah Weiner in his blackbird spy plane newsletter. Did you read this one called go glam mode?"
33:50;33:53;"Now the whole essay"
33:53;33:55;"GLM give the light a miss"
33:55;34:01;"Where he sort of rails on people who try to like cross the street very fast when they see the lights about the church"
34:01;34:04;"You know, they're like I got to get across the street and you go. Hey, you know what?"
34:04;34:06;"Give the light a miss just hang out"
34:06;34:12;"You got what's the extra 30 seconds for you to run across the street your whole life would be better if you just"
34:13;34:17;"Know it could even be dangerous. Where are you gonna get to? Why are you gonna push some lady out of the way?"
34:17;34:21;"You know just to get across the street a little bit faster. I don't know"
34:21;34:23;"I think that there's it's definitely true of"
34:23;34:28;"Driving when you think about some of the dangerous maneuvers people pull to shave three minutes off a drive"
34:28;34:31;"Yeah, like some guy pulling right around"
34:31;34:37;"You know this guy's combine right into the other side of the lane trucks barreling down the road just to get around"
34:37;34:40;"I'm sure that's happened. And actually I was thinking to"
34:40;34:42;"this song"
34:42;34:44;"clearly was a big hit and"
34:44;34:48;"I actually imagine that this song has saved lives because"
34:48;34:55;"I'm not even kidding because like this was like a big country song of its era. Let's say"
34:55;35:00;"You know in certain parts of the country everybody listens to country music whether you're a farmer"
35:00;35:07;"Whether you're a lawyer in the city, whatever and just like all over, you know people from different walks of life"
35:07;35:12;"Have to you know share the same communities sometimes and I could totally picture like some hotshot"
35:12;35:16;"Want to move out to the country outside of like Nashville or something?"
35:16;35:22;"He drives his fancy car into the city to go work at the law office. Every once in a while"
35:22;35:24;"he might get caught behind a combine and"
35:24;35:30;"Probably is angry and I bet this song once it came out diffused a few of those situations"
35:30;35:36;"Like somebody who's about to lay on the horn or like or do something kind of dangerous like pull around or like into the shoulder"
35:36;35:39;"You know, whatever probably like laugh to themselves and just was like"
35:39;35:46;"International harvester man. All right. All right. This is just one of those situations. I'm gonna wait patiently"
35:46;35:51;"Haha, I don't want to be like that guy profound wisdom. I love it reminds me of"
35:51;35:59;"I think I've referenced this before my my senior high school yearbook quote slow down to your food"
35:59;36:02;"Those my quote slow down to your food"
36:04;36:11;"Yeah, I love that wait is that and were you quoting somebody that's a yes original no, it's well, yes it was uh,"
36:11;36:15;"the Bill Murray character in Ghostbusters, he says that to"
36:15;36:22;"Dan Aykroyd, it's a very innocuous scene in the movie and Dan Aykroyd's just like scarfing down this Chinese food"
36:22;36:27;"Like right as they're getting the business started and they're stressed out about like money and like, you know"
36:27;36:34;"Just like getting the business off the ground and Aykroyd's just like stress eating and Murray's just like hey slow down show your food"
36:34;36:40;"Slow down to your food great advice. Yep, you know, hang out behind my mother says before you know"
36:40;36:42;"My my senior yearbook quote was I?"
36:42;36:46;"Don't do you love me? Do you surfer girl?"
36:46;36:56;"Do you know why I like that like double you you love me do you there's also yeah"
36:56;37:03;"There's something about that that it's so pretty in the song. Do you love me? Do you but like written out? Do you love me?"
37:03;37:09;"Do you surfer girl? I think I credit to Brian Wilson, which may or may not be true"
37:09;37:12;"I don't actually know if he wrote those lyrics"
37:12;37:19;"Little surfer, little one"
37:19;37:25;"May my heart come all undone"
37:25;37:33;"Do you love me? Do you surfer girl?"
37:33;37:39;"Surfer girl, my little surfer girl"
37:39;37:46;"I have watched you on the shore"
37:46;37:53;"Standing by the ocean's roar"
37:53;38:00;"Do you love me? Do you surfer girl?"
38:00;38:04;"Surfer girl, surfer girl"
38:04;38:13;"We could ride the surf together"
38:13;38:20;"While our love would grow"
38:20;38:27;"In my woody I will take you"
38:27;38:33;"Everywhere I go"
38:33;38:40;"So I say from me to you"
38:40;38:47;"I will make your dreams come true"
38:47;38:56;"Do you love me? Do you surfer girl?"
38:56;38:59;"Surfer girl, my little surfer girl"
38:59;39:07;"Actually speaking of 80s movies quotes, somebody was telling me about a band recently and they have a very long name"
39:07;39:15;"They're called I Don't Know How But They Found Us and somebody I was with immediately knew that that was a movie quote"
39:15;39:16;"Yeah, I know what it is"
39:16;39:17;"You know, Dick?"
39:17;39:18;"Yeah"
39:18;39:19;"What is it?"
39:19;39:20;"Back to the Future"
39:20;39:22;"Is that an iconic line or that's just one of those movies people have seen 30 times?"
39:22;39:26;"Rockfort Marty, I Don't Know How But They Found Us"
39:26;39:31;"I've seen that movie a million times. I mean, it's not really like, it's kind of like Slow Down and Chew Your Food"
39:31;39:35;"I mean, I guess it's a little more climactic than Slow Down and Chew Your Food"
39:35;39:39;"But it's when like they're testing out the time machine in the parking lot of the mall"
39:39;39:40;"Right"
39:40;39:51;"And then like the Libyans, like Doc Brown had like basically swindled the Libyan terrorists or whoever out of like plutonium to power the time machine"
39:51;39:52;"Oh yeah"
39:52;39:53;"And then they showed up"
39:53;39:54;"Definitely, I remember the Libyans"
39:54;39:57;"So what's the band called? It's I Don't Know How But They Found Us?"
39:57;40:02;"I Don't Know How But They Found Us and people sometimes call them IDK How for short"
40:02;40:03;"What's their sound?"
40:03;40:06;"Matt, you want to throw in an I Don't Know How But They Found Us song?"
40:06;40:10;"That seems like from a different era sort of like when there were bands named like"
40:10;40:12;"And I think it's Found Me"
40:12;40:13;"Oh, it's Found Me?"
40:13;40:16;"I Don't Know How But They Found Me"
40:26;40:27;"Stop!"
40:52;40:56;"What is this listed under Matt? What's their genre on Apple Music?"
40:56;40:59;"It's indie rock that references 80s movies"
40:59;41:07;"It looks like alternative also just to add, the drummer is from the band Falling In Reverse"
41:07;41:12;"And the vocalist I think was from another like pop punkish band"
41:12;41:16;"Oh, Panic At The Disco! Sorry, the singer is from Panic At The Disco"
41:16;41:21;"The singer of this band used to be in Panic At The Disco, I was going to say it had kind of Panic At The Disco vibes"
41:21;41:25;"It's a little alternative, little pop punk, little muse"
41:25;41:27;"Anyway, if you're a Back To The Future fan, check them out"
42:26;42:30;"You're listening to Time Crisis"
42:30;42:33;"Alright, let's get into it. Jake, you want to lead this one off?"
42:33;42:38;"Sure, I don't have much to lead it off with"
42:38;42:44;"I know, I've not heard this, this hit the thread a few weeks ago"
42:44;42:47;"That Fall Out Boy did a version"
42:47;42:48;"Breaking news"
42:48;42:55;"Breaking news, Fall Out Boy did a, I guess a rewrite of Billy Joel's We Didn't Start To Fire"
42:55;42:57;"I think this happened at least a month ago"
42:57;43:01;"Yeah, and that just seems like if anything is tailored for TC, that's it"
43:01;43:10;"So I guess they updated it, obviously Billy Joel's song was about the post-war era up until 1989 basically when that came out"
43:10;43:11;"Right"
43:11;43:14;"JFK blown away, what else do I have to say?"
43:14;43:15;"Kind of stuff"
43:15;43:20;"So this, they've rewritten it for the modern era, I don't know when they start, I'd be curious to see"
43:20;43:26;"Yeah, well first of all, my hat's off to Fall Out Boy, it's a great idea"
43:26;43:29;"I wonder if anybody tried to do this before"
43:29;43:34;"How about before we even get into it, let's throw on that BJ, the original We Didn't Start To Fire"
43:35;43:39;"[Applause]"
44:19;44:24;"So just these listing stuff from the, basically the 50s"
44:24;44:25;"Yeah"
44:39;44:41;"He's going kind of in front of us"
44:41;44:49;"Yeah, he's after Truman, who was president in 1945, '46, now we're up to Liberace"
44:49;44:52;"Is that Billy singing on the chorus?"
44:52;44:53;"Good question"
44:53;44:55;"It kind of doesn't sound like him"
45:00;45:02;"Roy Cohn"
45:02;45:04;"Roy Cohn, interesting"
45:19;45:21;"Trouble in the Suez"
45:21;45:23;"That's tight"
45:23;45:26;"So this starts in '49"
45:26;45:27;"What?"
45:27;45:33;"This, BJ's version starts at the beginning of 1949 and spans 40 years"
45:43;45:46;"Oh, I think it's when Billy Joel was born, is that right?"
45:46;45:48;"I would track"
45:48;45:50;"Like starting his whole life"
45:50;45:55;"It would have been sick if by the time he got to the 70s he just got fully into Billy Joel history"
45:59;46:01;"Billy Joel puts out the Stranger"
46:01;46:03;"Captain Jack Piano Man"
46:03;46:09;"The Strain, Cold Spring Harbor, The Stranger, Turnstiles, Glass Houses"
46:09;46:12;"And it is in chronological order"
46:12;46:14;"Christie Brinkley"
46:14;46:17;"Yes, she's the Uptown Girl"
46:17;46:19;"Yeah"
46:19;46:22;"Uptown Girl, Christie Brinkley"
46:22;46:26;"Their divorce, playing alimony"
46:26;46:30;"This starts talking about how Springsteen sucks"
46:30;46:31;"Yeah, exactly"
46:31;46:33;"Like, whoa, whoa"
46:33;46:35;"Playing alimony"
46:35;46:37;"Springsteen sucks"
46:50;46:54;"He drops a reference to his prog rock band Attila"
46:54;46:57;"Are you familiar with them?"
46:57;46:58;"Oh, a little bit"
46:58;47:00;"I'm more of the big six"
47:03;47:06;"I like it because it gets into the international affairs stuff"
47:06;47:09;"Russians in Afghanistan"
47:09;47:11;"It's like Mickey Mantle and Russians in Afghanistan"
47:11;47:15;"They get the same, they have the same weight"
47:15;47:19;"Which if you're a kid in America growing up"
47:19;47:21;"Mickey Mantle's more important"
47:21;47:22;"Yeah"
47:22;47:26;"So when this song came out, people"
47:26;47:27;"I might not have the timeline right"
47:27;47:30;"People thought he was ripping off"
47:30;47:33;"The End of the World As We Know It, R.E.M."
47:33;47:34;"Did they?"
47:34;47:36;"Interesting"
47:36;47:40;"Who was the first person to do like, like this type of list song?"
47:40;47:43;"I mean, there's gotta be folk songs that kind of"
47:43;47:47;"You know, work in this form, I would think"
47:47;47:48;"It's a good question"
47:48;47:51;"We didn't stop the fire"
47:51;47:55;"We're going home, it's just the world we're calling home"
47:55;47:57;"We didn't stop the fire"
47:57;48:01;"No, we didn't light it, but the time it burned"
48:01;48:04;"I don't really, like, how do you interpret what the chorus means?"
48:04;48:07;"Like, because he's just listing stuff"
48:07;48:10;"Some of it's good, some of it's tragic"
48:10;48:13;"He's just saying like the world's all been crazy"
48:13;48:15;"But then he's talking about like Doris Day, Mickey Mantle"
48:15;48:17;"I just, I don't understand like what"
48:17;48:20;"What is the perspective on this song?"
48:20;48:21;"That's a great question"
48:21;48:22;"I have thought about it before"
48:22;48:25;"And I think we've even talked about it on the show a bit"
48:25;48:27;"If you look at it through an anti-boomer lens"
48:27;48:30;"Which, you know, has been very fashionable the past"
48:30;48:31;"However many years"
48:31;48:35;"People always try to say, oh, the boomer generation is self-absorbed"
48:35;48:39;"They think that their unique history on earth"
48:39;48:41;"Is like the most important journey"
48:41;48:43;"All right, we get it, you know"
48:43;48:45;"You were born in this uptight world"
48:45;48:47;"And the '60s changed everything"
48:47;48:50;"And now you guys are holding on to all the resources"
48:50;48:53;"And you won't let go of power"
48:53;48:56;"You know, that's a certain take on the boomers"
48:56;48:58;"We're all familiar with"
48:58;49:00;"So if you look at it through that kind of"
49:00;49:02;"Slightly negative lens"
49:02;49:05;"You'd just be like, he was a boomer"
49:05;49:07;"Refusing to accept responsibility"
49:07;49:10;"For any role his generation may have played"
49:10;49:14;"In building the messed up current world that we live in"
49:14;49:16;"You know, like I could see"
49:16;49:17;"I'm sure people have said that"
49:17;49:20;"Oh, Billy Joel, classic boomer denialism"
49:20;49:21;"Oh, what?"
49:21;49:22;"What were we supposed to do?"
49:22;49:23;"Because you hear that all the time"
49:23;49:25;"Oh, they messed up the world"
49:25;49:26;"And this and that"
49:26;49:30;"I would think that a slightly more sophisticated take"
49:30;49:31;"Or charitable take"
49:31;49:35;"Is that Billy, like any member of his generation"
49:35;49:38;"Or let's say any member of any generation"
49:38;49:40;"In the late '80s"
49:40;49:42;"You know, he's in his '40s now"
49:42;49:44;"He's grown up"
49:44;49:47;"He's kind of like bewildered by everything that's happened"
49:47;49:50;"And he's really just saying that"
49:50;49:52;"Life is a crazy tapestry"
49:52;49:54;"Of seemingly unrelated things"
49:54;49:56;"It can feel very chaotic"
49:56;49:58;"Culture is changing all the time"
49:58;50:00;"Politics is changing all the time"
50:00;50:03;"This good thing happens, a bad thing happens"
50:03;50:05;"Everything's constantly moving"
50:05;50:08;"Life is nothing but change and flux"
50:08;50:12;"And he's actually making a sophisticated plea to like"
50:12;50:14;"Don't blame us"
50:14;50:16;"Not because we didn't play a role in this"
50:16;50:17;"Of course we did"
50:17;50:20;"But because this is a sequence of events"
50:20;50:21;"That's been always burning"
50:21;50:23;"Since the world's been turning"
50:23;50:26;"Life is a big, rich, weird tapestry"
50:26;50:29;"There are things that happened literally millions of years ago"
50:29;50:32;"That are still impacting things now"
50:32;50:34;"And you can try to stop the change"
50:34;50:37;"You can try to halt it in its tracks"
50:37;50:40;"But trust me, by the time you're"
50:40;50:41;"How old was Billy when he made this?"
50:41;50:42;"40?"
50:43;50:44;"I think maybe he's saying like"
50:44;50:47;"You know what guys, by the time you're 40, you'll get it"
50:47;50:51;"And maybe somewhere a young Pete Wentz"
50:51;50:53;"Was listening and saying like"
50:53;50:55;"No, Billy, it is your fault"
50:55;50:56;"You started this damn fire"
50:56;50:57;"You, Billy"
50:57;50:58;"And my generation, all that power"
50:58;51:00;"It was you, Billy"
51:00;51:02;"It was you and all the boomers"
51:02;51:03;"This is incredible"
51:03;51:05;"I gotta point this out"
51:05;51:07;"Ezra's right"
51:07;51:10;"I asked Chad GPT"
51:10;51:12;"What is the meaning of"
51:12;51:14;"Billy Joel's ""We Didn't Start the Fire"""
51:14;51:17;"And not only were you right in the sentiment"
51:17;51:19;"Of this collective unconscious"
51:19;51:20;"That whatever it's pulling from"
51:20;51:23;"You used the same words"
51:23;51:24;"Overall, so this is a"
51:24;51:26;"Overall, the song is a testament"
51:26;51:27;"To the constant state of change"
51:27;51:28;"And upheaval in the world"
51:28;51:30;"Suggesting that while individuals"
51:30;51:32;"May play a role in these events"
51:32;51:34;"They're also part of a larger tapestry"
51:34;51:36;"Of history that is always in motion"
51:36;51:38;"I mean the fact that you even said"
51:38;51:40;"A tapestry, I find that"
51:40;51:42;"I'm just saying"
51:42;51:43;"I'm trained on the same language model"
51:43;51:45;"As Chad GPT"
51:45;51:47;"Yeah, this is actually an AI Ezra"
51:47;51:50;"This is a test run on the first"
51:50;51:52;"I mean, I find that, yeah"
51:52;51:55;"I haven't done a teaser live since 2011"
51:55;51:59;"This is how we found out"
51:59;52:01;"We're in the machine"
52:01;52:03;"And you know who actually started the fire?"
52:03;52:05;"Prometheus"
52:05;52:07;"If anybody saw Oppenheimer"
52:07;52:09;"He referenced the Greek myth of Prometheus a lot"
52:09;52:12;"He stole fire from the gods"
52:12;52:13;"He started the fire"
52:13;52:15;"That's why that book is called American"
52:15;52:16;"I see"
52:16;52:17;"American Prometheus"
52:17;52:19;"Yeah, Oppenheimer is the American Prometheus"
52:19;52:21;"I think I'm seeing it next week, folks"
52:21;52:22;"When you watch it"
52:22;52:23;"Yeah"
52:23;52:24;"I want you to just imagine"
52:24;52:25;"That it ends with"
52:25;52:26;"We didn't start the fire"
52:26;52:28;"[Laughter]"
52:28;52:30;"Oppenheimer is a little bit of a"
52:30;52:32;"We didn't start the fire"
52:32;52:33;"You want to know that?"
52:33;52:35;"No spoilers, but it is kind of"
52:35;52:36;"We didn't start the fire"
52:36;52:37;"Like this guy"
52:37;52:39;"Played this huge role in history"
52:39;52:41;"And he wrestles with"
52:41;52:42;"What did I do?"
52:42;52:45;"But he's part of a larger tapestry of science"
52:45;52:46;"And progress"
52:46;52:47;"And violence"
52:47;52:48;"Wouldn't it be such a funny"
52:48;52:50;"And there's parts in it where he's talking to Einstein"
52:50;52:51;"I don't know, Albert"
52:51;52:54;"Sometimes I feel like I started this fire"
52:54;52:55;"Oppenheimer, you didn't"
52:55;52:56;"[Laughter]"
52:56;52:58;"You did not start this fire"
52:58;53:00;"You did not start this fire, Oppy"
53:00;53:03;"It's been always burning since the world's been"
53:03;53:05;"Since the world's been turning"
53:05;53:07;"Doesn't it feel like a real Hollywood"
53:07;53:09;"The end, a Christopher Nolan joint"
53:09;53:12;"Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, now"
53:12;53:13;"[Laughter]"
53:13;53:15;"But what I was going to say is that"
53:15;53:17;"I feel like it would be like such a funny"
53:17;53:19;"Very real Hollywood thing"
53:19;53:21;"For them to then say, you know what?"
53:21;53:22;"You know what would be cooler?"
53:22;53:24;"Than using Billy Joel?"
53:24;53:26;"Let's get Fall Out Boy to do a new one"
53:26;53:27;"Oh yeah"
53:27;53:28;"Christopher Nolan"
53:28;53:29;"Christopher Nolan says, ooh"
53:29;53:32;"Or his music director says, ooh, I like that"
53:32;53:35;"But let's get Fall Out Boy to end Oppenheimer"
53:35;53:36;"Sort of update it"
53:36;53:37;"That is a classic move"
53:37;53:40;"You get somebody to cover a song for a movie"
53:40;53:42;"And actually, as we talk about this"
53:42;53:45;"I want to say, before we get into the Fall Out Boy version"
53:45;53:48;"I think there's something kind of poignant"
53:48;53:51;"About musicians who've been around for a minute"
53:51;53:53;"Now they're in their 40s"
53:53;53:56;"Maybe have abandoned some of that youthful"
53:56;53:59;"Finger pointing and blaming the younger generation"
53:59;54:01;"And realize like, oh, wait a second"
54:01;54:04;"I used to be so angry at Billy Joel"
54:04;54:07;"Because he shirked responsibility for starting the fire"
54:07;54:10;"When I really believed he and his generation started the fire"
54:10;54:12;"And then I didn't realize, wait a second"
54:12;54:14;"When Billy wrote that song"
54:14;54:17;"He was a bewildered 40-year-old"
54:17;54:20;"Who probably felt like he'd been a kid just yesterday"
54:20;54:22;"And he was processing it"
54:22;54:23;"And hold on a second"
54:23;54:26;"Now I'm a member of Fall Out Boy"
54:26;54:27;"I'm in my early 40s"
54:27;54:29;"And I feel the same way"
54:29;54:31;"Like, wait, wait, I'm the adult"
54:31;54:33;"I have kids now"
54:33;54:36;"People are pointing at me and saying, yeah, that's right"
54:36;54:39;"Silverback millennial, younger Gen X"
54:39;54:41;"Why did you let all this happen?"
54:41;54:42;"All these problems"
54:42;54:43;"It's your fault"
54:43;54:45;"No, no, no, it wasn't me"
54:45;54:46;"It was the Boomers"
54:46;54:48;"Well, welcome to the club"
54:48;54:50;"Welcome to the club, man"
54:50;54:52;"And maybe this will be an interesting tradition"
54:52;54:55;"Every generation, when they reach 40-something"
54:55;54:57;"Will do their version of We Didn't Start the Fire"
54:57;55:00;"And they're kind of like, wow"
55:00;55:02;"I used to ju- somewhere there's a kid right now"
55:02;55:04;"Judging Fall Out Boy"
55:04;55:07;"Being like, why did you let all this crazy stuff happen in this world?"
55:07;55:09;"Come on, Patrick"
55:09;55:11;"You guys could have stopped all this"
55:11;55:13;"And then tomorrow, they'll be 40"
55:13;55:15;"And they'll be doing their own version of We Didn't Start the Fire"
55:15;55:17;"They'll be 40 and they'll be like, oh, wait, yeah"
55:17;55:19;"Rock stars have no power, actually"
55:19;55:21;"They can change the world at all"
55:21;55:23;"It's entertainment"
55:23;55:25;"Huh"
55:25;55:26;"That's funny"
55:26;55:28;"Anyway, I gotta do a cover of, uh"
55:28;55:31;"My manager said I have to do a cover of We Didn't Start the Fire for Oppenheimer 3"
55:31;55:33;"I like that for my guys"
55:33;55:35;"Let's go"
55:35;55:38;"Alright, let's do it"
55:38;55:40;"Let's dive into this Fall Out Boy"
55:40;56:08;"♪"
56:08;56:20;"♪"
56:20;56:22;"Oh, already amazing"
56:22;56:24;"Yeah, I'm loving it"
56:24;56:27;"Oklahoma City Bomb, Kirk Cobain, Pokemon"
56:27;56:43;"♪"
56:43;56:47;"Robert Downey Jr., Iron Man"
56:47;57:07;"♪"
57:07;57:19;"♪"
57:19;57:21;"Oh"
57:21;57:25;"The thing that rules about both songs is just like the"
57:25;57:29;"It's like the building anger at the end of the verses"
57:29;57:31;"Like, come on, man"
57:31;57:35;"Robert Downey Jr., Iron Man, that's not that big of a deal"
57:35;57:59;"♪"
57:59;58:02;"I just heard some Michael Jordan twice"
58:02;58:05;"Oh, did Michael Jordan come back with a different number?"
58:05;58:06;"Okay"
58:06;58:08;"Yeah, he did, right? The Wizard?"
58:08;58:37;"♪"
58:37;58:39;"I kinda like that it's not chronological"
58:39;58:40;"Yeah"
58:40;58:43;"I think it's great for our internet age"
58:43;58:45;"You're just bouncing around like a pinball"
58:45;58:56;"♪"
58:56;59:00;"Should we do a close review of these lyrics?"
59:00;59:02;"Yeah, I'm down"
59:02;59:04;"First of all, I wanna say, like"
59:04;59:06;"It actually really suits them"
59:06;59:09;"If the Billy Joel version didn't exist and that came out"
59:09;59:12;"I think that would be a massive hit for Fall Out Boy"
59:12;59:15;"I don't know, it sounds like a Fall Out Boy song"
59:15;59:18;"And it suits his voice, it suits their kind of arrangement"
59:18;59:21;"And my hat's off to them"
59:21;59:23;"I think they did their thing"
59:23;59:25;"It's a high bar"
59:25;59:27;"You know, people are always gonna be"
59:27;59:29;"Looking through something like this"
59:29;59:31;"Looking for flaws"
59:31;59:34;"It's gonna be goofy, there's no way that you're gonna write"
59:34;59:35;"The original is goofy"
59:35;59:37;"Yeah, there's no way you're gonna rewrite that song"
59:37;59:40;"And just be like, damn, that's really deep and profound"
59:40;59:42;"I really never thought about the world that way"
59:42;59:45;"I mean, it's supposed to be kind of like fun"
59:45;59:48;"Although it does touch on so many messed up things"
59:48;59:53;"In the most like, cavalier, sort of like casual way"
59:53;59:56;"The first lyric is ""Captain Planet"""
59:56;59:58;"What's that?"
59:58;59:59;"You know Captain Planet?"
59:59;01:00:00;"You don't know what Captain Planet is?"
01:00:00;01:00:01;"The cartoon"
01:00:01;01:00:02;"The Planeteers"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"You have no idea what Captain Planet is?"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"Never heard it"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"What is Captain Planet?"
01:00:08;01:00:10;"He was a superhero"
01:00:10;01:00:12;"He was an environmental superhero"
01:00:12;01:00:13;"He had green hair"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"And he was like"
01:00:15;01:00:16;"He was blue"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"Yeah, he's gonna take pollution down to zero"
01:00:18;01:00:20;"The song, the theme song"
01:00:20;01:00:21;"Where would I have encountered this?"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"Can we drop that? Can we run that theme song?"
01:00:23;01:00:27;"You know what, Jake, this is where the years between really kick in"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"Was it on TV?"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"Yeah, it was on the television"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"What year did this drop? Like '91?"
01:00:32;01:00:35;"It ran from '92 to '96"
01:00:35;01:00:38;"It was like a children's cartoon"
01:00:38;01:00:41;"Yeah, like, it for older kids"
01:00:41;01:00:45;"I think this show is like really hitting when you're like 8, 9"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"Yeah, I was 14 in '91, so"
01:00:48;01:00:49;"I missed this one"
01:00:49;01:00:50;"You were drinking Fireball by then"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"Oh yeah"
01:00:51;01:00:54;"Jake was sneaking bottles of Fireball from the gas station by then"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"Listening to Pavement"
01:00:56;01:01:01;"It was co-created by Ted Turner, media mogul and CNN founder"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"He loved the environment too"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"And there were like all the planeteers"
01:01:05;01:01:07;"One of them represented Earth"
01:01:07;01:01:09;"Water, Ezra, you know what I'm talking about"
01:01:09;01:01:10;"Fire was one"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"Heart, Heart was the last one"
01:01:12;01:01:15;"Yeah, I was always a little confusing, Heart, but okay"
01:01:15;01:01:18;"I get it, like none of it works without Heart"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"I understand it now"
01:01:20;01:01:21;"Whoopi Goldberg"
01:01:21;01:01:22;"It didn't make a lot"
01:01:22;01:01:23;"Yeah, it didn't make sense, I agree"
01:01:23;01:01:27;"And they would always be fighting like fat cat polluters, right?"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"Fat cat polluters, tycoons"
01:01:29;01:01:32;"They'd always just be like, yeah, some nasty tycoon just being like"
01:01:32;01:01:37;"And when I poison everybody in the entire city"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"I'll make even more money"
01:01:39;01:01:43;"When I make them drink my toxic sludge"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"And they'd come in, rough them up a little bit"
01:01:45;01:01:48;"It was like Voltron, they'd all say their elements"
01:01:48;01:01:52;"And then they would summon Captain Planet from the sewer"
01:01:52;01:01:55;"And he would come and, you know, f*** up"
01:01:55;01:01:58;"And Whoopi Goldberg, friend of the show Whoopi Goldberg"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"Was the voice of Gaia, spirit of the Earth"
01:02:00;01:02:01;"Oh yeah"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"Alright, let's move on Captain Planet, guys"
01:02:03;01:02:05;"I'm good, I actually don't need"
01:02:05;01:02:08;"You know, I got like a full primer course on Captain Planet"
01:02:08;01:02:09;"No, no, no"
01:02:09;01:02:10;"You should watch it"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"I would start with the third season"
01:02:12;01:02:15;"I mean, you can go back and watch the first and second after"
01:02:15;01:02:19;"Like, but you know, if you watch season three through five"
01:02:19;01:02:22;"You'll take it down in about a week"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"Because you'll be watching multiple episodes a night"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"Jake, you got a DVD player?"
01:02:26;01:02:28;"Do you have a DVD player in your house?"
01:02:28;01:02:29;"Of course"
01:02:29;01:02:30;"Let's get him the box set"
01:02:30;01:02:33;"Alright, we'll get you the DVD box set"
01:02:33;01:02:35;"Okay, Captain Planet"
01:02:35;01:02:38;"Should we just do the song or just jump around?"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"Should we just talk it through?"
01:02:40;01:02:43;"Yeah, let's have Jake, you should read it"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"Okay, Captain Planet, you know what that is"
01:02:45;01:02:46;"Arab Spring, yeah"
01:02:46;01:02:49;"Already in the first two lines, they've established"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"That you don't know what the hell you're in for"
01:02:51;01:02:54;"I bet they actually put some thought into it"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"They're like, if we start with Captain Planet, Arab Spring"
01:02:56;01:02:59;"People know that we're being chaotic"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"And we're juxtaposing stuff"
01:03:01;01:03:04;"Which I guess Billy Joel did too, you know?"
01:03:04;01:03:07;"Yeah, no, his was totally chaotic"
01:03:07;01:03:08;"It just was in order"
01:03:08;01:03:11;"But again, I don't think it really matters"
01:03:11;01:03:15;"Captain Planet, Arab Spring, LA Riots, Rodney King"
01:03:15;01:03:19;"Deepfakes, earthquakes, Iceland volcano"
01:03:19;01:03:21;"Oklahoma City Bomb"
01:03:21;01:03:22;"That's all stuff that happened"
01:03:22;01:03:25;"Kurt Cobain, just the existence of Kurt Cobain"
01:03:25;01:03:28;"Oklahoma City Bomb, Kurt Cobain, Pokemon"
01:03:28;01:03:29;"Tiger Woods, MySpace"
01:03:29;01:03:30;"That's what Billy Joel did"
01:03:30;01:03:32;"He would just list people"
01:03:32;01:03:33;"Yeah, Billy Joel just listed people"
01:03:33;01:03:34;"Yeah, Billy Joel did"
01:03:34;01:03:35;"Joe DiMaggio"
01:03:35;01:03:39;"Tiger Woods, MySpace, Monsanto, GMOs"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"So sometimes they'll like pair stuff"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"They'll pair LA Riots and Rodney King"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"They'll pair Monsanto, GMOs"
01:03:45;01:03:49;"Harry Potter, Twilight, Michael Jackson dies"
01:03:49;01:03:50;"Nuclear accident"
01:03:50;01:03:52;"Oh, Fukushima, Japan"
01:03:52;01:03:56;"Crimean Peninsula, Cambridge Analytica"
01:03:56;01:04:00;"Kim Jong-un, Robert Downey Jr., Iron Man"
01:04:00;01:04:02;"This would be hard to sing"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"These syllables are just like"
01:04:04;01:04:05;"It's very dense"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"You need to know the specific delivery"
01:04:07;01:04:10;"Yeah, I don't have that down quite yet"
01:04:10;01:04:13;"More war in Afghanistan, Cubs go all the way again"
01:04:13;01:04:14;"That's pretty funny"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"Well, they're from Chicago"
01:04:15;01:04:16;"Okay"
01:04:16;01:04:17;"They have a Chicago POV"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"Oh, and they shout out Kanye West later"
01:04:19;01:04:20;"Yep"
01:04:20;01:04:24;"Obama, Spielberg, explosion, Lebanon"
01:04:24;01:04:26;"When was the explosion in Lebanon?"
01:04:26;01:04:27;"I thought that was 1982"
01:04:27;01:04:28;"What was-"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"No, no, no, there's that huge one in Beirut"
01:04:30;01:04:33;"It was like a factory exploded"
01:04:33;01:04:35;"that was like full of explosives"
01:04:35;01:04:36;"Oh"
01:04:36;01:04:37;"Rocked the whole city"
01:04:37;01:04:38;"Right, right"
01:04:38;01:04:39;"Yeah, it was-"
01:04:39;01:04:40;"No, no, no, that was recent"
01:04:40;01:04:41;"Oh, God"
01:04:41;01:04:42;"Three years ago"
01:04:42;01:04:44;"Again, time is a flat circle, right?"
01:04:44;01:04:47;"It's kind of what the songs sing"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"I like this one"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"Unabomber, Bobbitt, John"
01:04:51;01:04:53;"Bombing Boston Marathon"
01:04:53;01:04:55;"That's a good line"
01:04:55;01:04:57;"Unabomber, Bobbitt, John"
01:04:57;01:04:59;"Bombing Boston Marathon"
01:04:59;01:05:02;"Balloon boy, war on terror, QAnon"
01:05:02;01:05:03;"Good alliteration"
01:05:03;01:05:06;"Do you remember, where were you when the balloon boy-"
01:05:06;01:05:07;"Were you captivated?"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"Do you remember where you were?"
01:05:09;01:05:10;"I don't remember the balloon boy"
01:05:10;01:05:11;"I barely remember"
01:05:11;01:05:12;"Wait, was balloon boy a hoax?"
01:05:12;01:05:13;"What was that?"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"Yeah, balloon boy captivated America when"
01:05:15;01:05:16;"the balloon-"
01:05:16;01:05:19;"There was a balloon that took off from the home"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"of a family"
01:05:21;01:05:25;"and it was reported that there was a boy in the balloon"
01:05:25;01:05:30;"and it was like, this was live on television for hours"
01:05:30;01:05:33;"and I remember everything stopped"
01:05:33;01:05:36;"when the balloon boy went sky high"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"and then it turned out to be a hoax"
01:05:38;01:05:42;"there was no boy, ultimately, in the balloon"
01:05:42;01:05:45;"They were very worried he was going to lose oxygen"
01:05:45;01:05:46;"I remember that"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"and they were saying, uh oh"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"the balloon boy's lost oxygen"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"Six year old boy"
01:05:52;01:05:53;"Where was that?"
01:05:53;01:05:55;"Fort Collins, Colorado"
01:05:55;01:05:57;"Huh, deep"
01:05:57;01:05:58;"So wait, what year was that?"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"Was it like early Twitter era?"
01:06:00;01:06:01;"2009"
01:06:01;01:06:02;"Yeah, that might have been right when"
01:06:02;01:06:03;"2009"
01:06:03;01:06:04;"Right when Twitter was popping off"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"So early Obama years"
01:06:06;01:06:10;"he sent some F-16s to try to take it down"
01:06:10;01:06:11;"I don't think he shot down-"
01:06:11;01:06:12;"Did he?"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"Did he try to shoot down the balloon boy?"
01:06:14;01:06:15;"I think the generals-"
01:06:15;01:06:18;"he was circled by F-16s and Obama said, ""Hold your fire"""
01:06:18;01:06:22;"[laughter]"
01:06:22;01:06:23;"They were ready to take him out"
01:06:23;01:06:25;"Obama said, ""One of two things is true"
01:06:25;01:06:28;"either there's a six year old boy on that balloon"
01:06:28;01:06:31;"and I don't want him to be bombed to pieces"
01:06:31;01:06:34;"or that he's not and it's a waste of ammunition"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"either way, hold your fire"""
01:06:36;01:06:38;"and the generals were like, ""President!"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"Please!"""
01:06:40;01:06:42;"[laughter]"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"That was a defining decision point"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"in his first administration"
01:06:46;01:06:50;"Yeah, the balloon boy kind of forgot about"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"but that's the fun of a song like this"
01:06:52;01:06:53;"Yeah"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"They make you think about everything that's happened in the past"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"This is a pretty bleak one"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"Trump gets impeached twice"
01:06:59;01:07:01;"Polar bears got no ice"
01:07:01;01:07:03;"[laughter]"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"Polar bears got no ice"
01:07:05;01:07:07;"Firefest, Black Parade"
01:07:07;01:07:10;"Michael Phelps, Y2K"
01:07:10;01:07:11;"What's Black Parade?"
01:07:11;01:07:13;"I was about to ask if you knew that"
01:07:13;01:07:14;"No"
01:07:14;01:07:15;"You wanna guess?"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"Is it a band?"
01:07:17;01:07:18;"Close"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"Is it like a festival?"
01:07:20;01:07:21;"No"
01:07:21;01:07:22;"Getting a little cooler"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"Okay, it's a band"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"You're warm"
01:07:25;01:07:26;"DJ?"
01:07:26;01:07:29;"A little cooler"
01:07:29;01:07:30;"Go back to band"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"A rap group?"
01:07:31;01:07:33;"No, I'm saying go back to band"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"You're warm when you're on band"
01:07:35;01:07:36;"Are they a rock band?"
01:07:36;01:07:37;"No"
01:07:37;01:07:40;"Well, okay, but it's something adjacent to a rock band"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"Something a rock band might..."
01:07:42;01:07:44;"What are things that rock bands do?"
01:07:44;01:07:45;"Tour?"
01:07:45;01:07:46;"Put out records?"
01:07:46;01:07:47;"Yes"
01:07:47;01:07:48;"Warmer"
01:07:48;01:07:49;"Is it a record?"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"Black Parade"
01:07:51;01:07:54;"Is it a record label?"
01:07:54;01:07:57;"No, you're right, it's an album"
01:07:57;01:07:59;"Do you have any idea who made it?"
01:07:59;01:08:00;"Fall Out Boy?"
01:08:00;01:08:01;"Warm"
01:08:01;01:08:04;"I don't know how to get warmer from Fall Out Boy"
01:08:04;01:08:06;"[laughter]"
01:08:06;01:08:09;"I don't know which direction I'm headed here"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"Right, you gotta throw out another band"
01:08:11;01:08:12;"Deeper into emo rock?"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"Yes"
01:08:14;01:08:17;"I don't know, I don't like any of those bands"
01:08:17;01:08:20;"You're never gonna guess this one"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"Okay, I'll give you one last hint"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"They're from New Jersey"
01:08:24;01:08:27;"And their singer's name is Gerard Way"
01:08:27;01:08:28;"Three words"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"I think that might be why you said it was close"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"Three words"
01:08:31;01:08:34;"Throw out the song Black Parade for Jake"
01:08:34;01:08:43;"[piano music]"
01:08:43;01:08:46;"I've heard this, did Kanye say all this?"
01:08:46;01:08:47;"No"
01:08:47;01:08:48;"[laughter]"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"Oh yeah, I've heard this"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"It might have inspired Runaway"
01:08:52;01:08:55;"Yeah, yeah, that song on Twisted Fantasy"
01:08:55;01:08:59;"Jake, for a certain generation of emo kids, this is Bohemian Rhapsody"
01:08:59;01:09:13;"[piano music]"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"I've heard this song before"
01:09:15;01:09:16;"It's cool"
01:09:16;01:09:17;"Yeah, it is a cool song"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"It's a triumphant"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"dramatic song"
01:09:21;01:09:23;"I know the name of the band"
01:09:23;01:09:26;"Wait, what was that big single from the album before this?"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"The I'm Not Okay song?"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"I always liked that song"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"This is this band, Sgt. Pepper"
01:09:33;01:09:35;"Before they made this"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"This is like, before they went Sgt. Pepper"
01:09:37;01:09:40;"This is their, like, Please Please Me"
01:09:40;01:09:47;"[piano music]"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"So they were contemporaries of the Ballad Boy"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"I'm sure I've heard the name"
01:09:51;01:09:52;"Like, when we say the name"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"First word, my"
01:09:55;01:09:56;"Chemical Romance"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"Yeah, well done"
01:09:58;01:10:00;"Okay, well done"
01:10:00;01:10:12;"[piano music]"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"Yeah, it always has great melodies"
01:10:14;01:10:42;"[piano music]"
01:10:42;01:10:45;"This is the only album he shouts out"
01:10:45;01:10:46;"Yeah, Black Parade"
01:10:46;01:10:51;"I guess it makes sense that for Ballad Boy fans, Black Parade"
01:10:51;01:10:53;"maybe is kind of like a Sgt. Pepper"
01:10:53;01:10:54;"You wanna hear a very quick"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"It's a very important album"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"You wanna hear a very quick, what I think is like, fascinating"
01:10:58;01:11:02;"It's sort of almost related to Read and Start the Fire, My Chemical Romance story"
01:11:02;01:11:03;"Yeah"
01:11:03;01:11:06;"Gerard Way had sold a car-"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"He wasn't gonna be in a band"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"My Chemical Romance doesn't exist"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"He wanted to make cartoons and comic books"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"which he ended up doing, you know, he created"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"Oh yeah, Umbrella Academy"
01:11:16;01:11:17;"For Umbrella Academy"
01:11:17;01:11:18;"Huge, huge success"
01:11:18;01:11:19;"And they made a TV show"
01:11:19;01:11:21;"Yeah, so"
01:11:21;01:11:23;"He went and sold a show to Cartoon Network"
01:11:23;01:11:26;"and he was like, That's it, I'm gonna make a TV show"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"or maybe he had set up a pitch to pitch them"
01:11:28;01:11:31;"and he was feeling, Alright, this is gonna be my career"
01:11:31;01:11:34;"He's a young guy, got time to make the pitch"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"you know, sat down with some network executives"
01:11:36;01:11:39;"I can't remember if it happened, if they bought it or not"
01:11:39;01:11:41;"but basically 9/11 happened"
01:11:41;01:11:42;"Maybe the day that it was-"
01:11:42;01:11:43;"Whoa"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"You know what, I think if I remember correctly"
01:11:45;01:11:48;"it's like the day that he's supposed to actually pitch"
01:11:48;01:11:49;"is 9/11"
01:11:49;01:11:50;"Was 9/11"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"And so they cancelled the pitch"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"He doesn't do it and he goes"
01:11:54;01:11:57;"I don't know, like"
01:11:57;01:11:59;"either this is a sign or I don't know when I'm gonna get"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"like a pitch back on the books"
01:12:01;01:12:03;"and that side of the career is over"
01:12:03;01:12:08;"and he, out of that, like immediately I think started working on My Chemical Romance"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"Whoa, that's crazy"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"Isn't that crazy?"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"So, truly it was"
01:12:14;01:12:17;"and I said, we didn't start the fire away"
01:12:17;01:12:20;"'cause they must, they shot out 9/11, right?"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"Oh yeah, is there a 9/11 in this?"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"There is, World Trade Second Plane"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"What else do I have to say?"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"So there you go, so World Trade Second Plane"
01:12:27;01:12:30;"My Chemical Romance began"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"Wow, that's an amazing story"
01:12:32;01:12:33;"That's wild"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"Talk about a sliding doors moment"
01:12:35;01:12:36;"Yeah"
01:12:37;01:12:40;"I wonder if Osama Bin Laden never knew that"
01:12:40;01:12:43;"Osama Bin Laden, well they always claim he had all this random stuff on his hard drives"
01:12:43;01:12:46;"That sounds like the type of thing you would like hear"
01:12:46;01:12:49;"or something like, you know that Osama Bin Laden had like a whole"
01:12:49;01:12:55;"rip of Black Parade by My Chemical Romance on his hard drive?"
01:12:55;01:12:56;"They found his LimeWire"
01:12:56;01:12:57;"I always hear stuff like that"
01:12:57;01:12:58;"They had his LimeWire account"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"Don't they always say stuff like that?"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"Like, oh yeah, he had like two seasons of Family Guy"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"Yeah, Sex in the City"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"A bunch of porn, Sex in the City"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"Really surprising stuff"
01:13:08;01:13:12;"So what he actually had was, he had video games"
01:13:12;01:13:16;"He had Yoshi's Island, Final Fantasy"
01:13:16;01:13:20;"Mr. Bean, he had memes, he was into memes"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"Ooh, early, early memes"
01:13:22;01:13:23;"Early in the memes"
01:13:23;01:13:25;"Some pre-9/11 memes"
01:13:25;01:13:27;"Well, shout out to Fallout Boy"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"It's a fun song"
01:13:29;01:13:32;"It says in our notes that it got a lot of negative reactions"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"All the haters can go to hell"
01:13:34;01:13:35;"Not on this show"
01:13:36;01:13:37;"We're pro"
01:13:37;01:13:40;"And anyway, to anybody talking s***"
01:13:40;01:13:43;"I want to hear your We Didn't Start the Fire"
01:13:43;01:13:45;"I love that this became a tradition every year"
01:13:45;01:13:49;"Somebody has to step up and do a We Didn't Start the Fire"
01:13:49;01:13:51;"That would be a very fun exercise"
01:13:51;01:13:53;"to sit around with your friends"
01:13:53;01:13:56;"and just like, with the spiral ring notebook"
01:13:56;01:13:57;"and just like"
01:13:57;01:13:58;"Oh yeah"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"Just co-write it together, sitting around"
01:14:00;01:14:01;"Yeah"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"Order some Chinese food, crack some brews"
01:14:03;01:14:05;"Yeah, a New Year's tradition"
01:14:05;01:14:06;"Yeah"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"We Didn't Start the Fire 2023"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"Am I making this up as well?"
01:14:10;01:14:13;"Isn't Pete Wentz a huge fan of Neo Yokio?"
01:14:13;01:14:15;"He was a big supporter of Neo Yokio"
01:14:15;01:14:17;"Yeah, he was a big early fan, so yeah"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"And I've always been a huge fan of his"
01:14:19;01:14:22;"because one thing that's really cool about him"
01:14:22;01:14:25;"is he's a Pete Townsend type"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"in that he is not the singer of the band"
01:14:27;01:14:29;"but he's the primary lyricist"
01:14:29;01:14:31;"Oh, interesting"
01:14:31;01:14:32;"I did not know that"
01:14:32;01:14:36;"I feel like they really have a very specific lyrical style"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"You know, you think even their early hit"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"Going down, down"
01:14:40;01:14:41;"I'll be your number one"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"With a bullet loaded gun complex"
01:14:43;01:14:44;"Cock it and pull it"
01:14:44;01:14:47;"Like, he really has a way with words"
01:14:47;01:14:48;"And I always find that interesting"
01:14:48;01:14:49;"when it's like"
01:14:49;01:14:51;"he's like the bassist writing the lyrics"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"and clearly he's got this kind of mind meld"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"with the singer"
01:14:55;01:14:57;"Anyway, shout out to Fall Out Boy"
01:14:57;01:15:01;"Am I more than you bargained for yet?"
01:15:01;01:15:04;"I've been dying to tell you anything"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"You already hear"
01:15:06;01:15:09;"'Cause that's just who I am this week"
01:15:09;01:15:10;"Lying in the grass"
01:15:10;01:15:14;"Next to the Mars alien"
01:15:14;01:15:16;"I'm just a notch in your bedpost"
01:15:16;01:15:21;"But you're just a lullaby to song"
01:15:21;01:15:24;"Drop a heart"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"And break a name"
01:15:26;01:15:29;"We're always sleeping in the same bed"
01:15:29;01:15:32;"For the wrong team"
01:15:32;01:15:34;"We're going down, down"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"In a million rounds"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"And sugar we're going down swinging"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"I'll be your number one"
01:15:40;01:15:43;"With a bullet loaded gun complex"
01:15:43;01:15:44;"Cock it and pull it"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"We're going down, down"
01:15:46;01:15:47;"In a million rounds"
01:15:47;01:15:50;"And sugar we're going down swinging"
01:15:50;01:15:51;"I'll be your number one"
01:15:51;01:15:55;"With a bullet loaded gun complex"
01:15:55;01:15:56;"Cock it and pull it"
01:15:56;01:15:57;"Alright, top 5?"
01:15:57;01:15:58;"Top 5"
01:15:58;01:16:01;"It's time for the Top 5"
01:16:01;01:16:05;"5 on iTunes"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"This week on the Top 5"
01:16:07;01:16:10;"We're comparing the Top 5 hits of the present day"
01:16:10;01:16:14;"With the Top 5 songs of 1999"
01:16:14;01:16:15;"Why 1999?"
01:16:15;01:16:22;"'Cause we're continuing our episode to year matching system"
01:16:22;01:16:24;"This is episode 199"
01:16:24;01:16:25;"That's crazy"
01:16:25;01:16:26;"Next episode we've done 200"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"We're gonna do something"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"Yeah, crazy"
01:16:30;01:16:34;"So we're doing 1999 'cause it's close to 199"
01:16:34;01:16:37;"So the number 5 song this week in 1999"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"Well this is an all time classic"
01:16:39;01:16:41;"Smash Mouth - All Star"
01:16:41;01:16:45;"Somebody once told me the world is too lonely"
01:16:45;01:16:46;"So this was both on their album Astro Lounge"
01:16:46;01:16:50;"And the Mystery Men original soundtrack"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"She was looking kind of dumb"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"With her finger and her thumb"
01:16:54;01:16:57;"This song got a second life 'cause of Shrek, right?"
01:16:57;01:16:58;"Yes"
01:16:58;01:16:59;"Seinfeld, you must"
01:16:59;01:17:02;"That sounds like something you would know a bunch about"
01:17:02;01:17:03;"No, that's true"
01:17:03;01:17:04;"That's exactly right"
01:17:04;01:17:05;"For the Zoomers, this is the Shrek song"
01:17:05;01:17:06;"It's time to live for fun"
01:17:06;01:17:09;"Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb"
01:17:09;01:17:10;"So much to do, so much to see"
01:17:10;01:17:13;"So what's wrong with taking the back streets?"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"You'll never know if you don't go"
01:17:15;01:17:18;"You'll never shine if you don't glow"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:17:20;01:17:23;"Get your game on, go play"
01:17:23;01:17:25;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:17:25;01:17:28;"Get your game on, go play"
01:17:28;01:17:31;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:17:31;01:17:34;"Get your game on, go play"
01:17:34;01:17:37;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:17:37;01:17:40;"Get your game on, go play"
01:17:40;01:17:43;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:17:43;01:17:46;"Get your game on, go play"
01:17:46;01:17:49;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:17:49;01:17:52;"Get your game on, go play"
01:17:52;01:17:55;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:17:55;01:17:58;"Get your game on, go play"
01:17:58;01:18:01;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:18:01;01:18:04;"Get your game on, go play"
01:18:04;01:18:07;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:18:07;01:18:10;"Get your game on, go play"
01:18:10;01:18:13;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:18:13;01:18:16;"Get your game on, go play"
01:18:16;01:18:19;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:18:19;01:18:22;"Get your game on, go play"
01:18:22;01:18:25;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:18:25;01:18:28;"Get your game on, go play"
01:18:28;01:18:31;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:18:31;01:18:34;"Get your game on, go play"
01:18:34;01:18:37;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:18:37;01:18:40;"Get your game on, go play"
01:18:40;01:18:43;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:18:43;01:18:46;"Get your game on, go play"
01:18:46;01:18:49;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:18:49;01:18:52;"Somebody once asked, could I spare some change"
01:18:52;01:18:57;"Well guess I need to get myself away from this place"
01:18:57;01:19:00;"I said, yeah, what a concept"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"I could use a little fuel myself"
01:19:02;01:19:07;"And we could all use a little change"
01:19:07;01:19:10;"Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"Back to the rules and I'll hit the ground running"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"Did it make sense not to live for fun?"
01:19:14;01:19:16;"You can get smart but your head gets dumb"
01:19:16;01:19:18;"So much to do, so much to see"
01:19:18;01:19:21;"So what's wrong with taking the back streets?"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"You'll never know if you don't go"
01:19:23;01:19:25;"You'll never shine if you don't glow"
01:19:25;01:19:27;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:19:27;01:19:30;"Get your game on, go play"
01:19:30;01:19:33;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:19:33;01:19:36;"Get your game on, go play"
01:19:36;01:19:39;"Hey now, you're an all star"
01:19:39;01:19:42;"Get your game on, go play"
01:19:42;01:19:45;"Yeah, I'm sick of all these anti-summer songs"
01:19:45;01:19:48;"You know that I've caught it"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"Bad, bad boy, sunny toy"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"This song came out four years ago"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"But it's currently having a resurgence"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"Due to Swift's The Errors Tour"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"Which kicked off in March 2023"
01:19:58;01:20:01;"She would open each show with the lover section"
01:20:01;01:20:04;"With Cruel Summer being the second song played"
01:20:04;01:20:08;"Are you aware of this Jake, that Taylor Swift is the new Grateful Dead?"
01:20:08;01:20:11;"I do see a lot of hubbub in the media about this tour"
01:20:11;01:20:14;"What exactly is so insane about this tour?"
01:20:14;01:20:16;"Can someone explain it to me?"
01:20:16;01:20:19;"It is going to be the biggest tour of all time"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"At least in terms of money"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"Because the tickets are so much?"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"I mean obviously she's playing huge"
01:20:25;01:20:27;"Well I've seen tons of tickets"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"She's filling the stadiums"
01:20:29;01:20:32;"I guess she hasn't done a big tour in a while"
01:20:32;01:20:34;"Because of COVID and stuff"
01:20:34;01:20:37;"Her popularity has ascended to this place where"
01:20:37;01:20:40;"And because she's calling it the Errors Tour"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"It's like she's digging into the archives"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"It's a really long show"
01:20:44;01:20:48;"She's playing stuff from throughout her whole career"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"The set list is fairly consistent"
01:20:50;01:20:53;"But there's a surprise song or two every night"
01:20:53;01:20:56;"To me it sounds a little more like a Bruce Springsteen show"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"Than a Grateful Dead show"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"I think just why you're hearing so much about it"
01:21:00;01:21:03;"Outside of it being one of the largest tours"
01:21:03;01:21:06;"There's a lot of news around how it's saved"
01:21:06;01:21:08;"Certain economies"
01:21:08;01:21:13;"You know, it's GDP is insane"
01:21:13;01:21:15;"What does it say?"
01:21:15;01:21:18;"Swift could add over $4.6 billion in consumer spending"
01:21:18;01:21:20;"To the US economy"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"That's a lot of nachos"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"So I think that's been a huge part"
01:21:26;01:21:29;"When she does two nights at the Taco Bell Dome or something"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"People are buying hotels"
01:21:31;01:21:33;"Renting cars"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"Okay"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"Alright, no hot takes"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"Other than I didn't know that"
01:22:07;01:22:10;"St. Vincent Andy Clark was a songwriter on this song"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"Learn something new every day"
01:22:12;01:22:15;"The number four song this week in 1999"
01:22:15;01:22:17;"Wow"
01:22:17;01:22:20;"These 1999 songs, I know this so well"
01:22:20;01:22:22;"Isn't that a thing people say"
01:22:22;01:22:24;"Or they're like, there's something about"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"The summer you were 14"
01:22:26;01:22:30;"Is some kind of meaningful thing"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"This is actually the summer I was"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"This is the summer I was 15"
01:22:34;01:22:36;"But I just know this so well"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"I know all these songs so well"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"This is LFO with Summer Girls"
01:22:42;01:22:44;"It's from 1999"
01:22:44;01:22:46;"This is pro summer"
01:22:46;01:22:48;"This is pre-9/11"
01:22:48;01:22:50;"When you could still enjoy the summer"

01:29:28;01:29:30;"The only way I could describe it"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"Is that it does sound like"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"An AI"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"You basically said make a"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"Kanye album with Travis Scott"
01:29:38;01:29:40;"It's very strange"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"There's always been a connection"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"Between Travis Scott and Kanye"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"And you know he's his"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"Protégé but there's something about this"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"That feels"
01:29:50;01:29:52;"It feels weird and I think that there's"
01:29:52;01:29:54;"I read some"
01:29:54;01:29:56;"Review that said that"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"Travis Scott was single white femaling"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"Kanye"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"Which I thought was actually"
01:30:02;01:30:04;"Really accurate very funny and very accurate"
01:30:04;01:30:06;"Yeah it's definitely a new hip hop"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"Classic"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"Is it a new hip hop? Well I mean it's huge"
01:30:38;01:30:40;"Kanye"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"This is honestly this is probably the only song"
01:30:42;01:30:44;"That's not if you put on the first or second"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"Song I mean it's pretty weird"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"I mean I would say put on the first song"
01:30:48;01:30:50;"If you want to hear it"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"You don't need to I find it a bit"
01:30:52;01:30:54;"Sort of disappointing and sad"
01:30:54;01:30:56;"As a huge"
01:30:56;01:30:58;"I mean I'm hearing this song for the first time"
01:30:58;01:31:00;"Via FaceTime"
01:31:00;01:31:02;"But it's no"
01:31:02;01:31:04;"Summer Girls I'm sorry but"
01:31:04;01:31:06;"Hip hop peaked in 1999"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"The number"
01:31:08;01:31:10;"Three song in 99"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"KC and JoJo"
01:31:12;01:31:14;"Tell me it's real"
01:31:18;01:31:20;"So KC and JoJo just crushed it"
01:31:20;01:31:22;"In the 90s first with"
01:31:22;01:31:24;"Jodeci and then they branched out"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"On their own"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"I'm trying to remember this one I definitely remember"
01:31:28;01:31:30;"All my life oh this one"
01:31:30;01:31:32;"This song is awesome"
01:31:32;01:31:34;"Oh it sounds so good"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"Those 99 keyboard sounds"
01:32:06;01:32:08;"Very similar palettes of Mariah Carey"
01:32:08;01:32:10;"Always be my baby"
01:32:10;01:32:12;"Loving this BPM"
01:32:12;01:32:14;"Yeah this feels good"
01:32:34;01:32:36;"Beautiful"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"What was their story?"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"I don't know anything about these dudes"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"Do you know anything about them?"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"They were in this group Jodeci"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"That was like huge"
01:32:56;01:32:58;"Let's see"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"Jodeci was formed in 1989"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"In Charlotte, North Carolina"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"KC and JoJo went and did their own thing"
01:33:18;01:33:20;"Tight"
01:33:20;01:33:22;"So they're from North Carolina"
01:33:22;01:33:24;"Yeah"
01:33:30;01:33:32;"But KC and JoJo are brothers"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"Oh really? Blood Harmony"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"Yeah"
01:34:04;01:34:06;"Tell me it's real"
01:34:06;01:34:10;"The feeling that we feel"
01:34:10;01:34:14;"Tell me that it's real"
01:34:14;01:34:18;"Don't let love come just to pass you by"
01:34:18;01:34:20;"You better try"
01:34:20;01:34:24;"It's all we have to do"
01:34:24;01:34:28;"It's up to me and you"
01:34:28;01:34:32;"To make this special love last forever"
01:34:32;01:34:34;"Tell me it's real"
01:34:34;01:34:38;"The feeling that we feel"
01:34:38;01:34:42;"Tell me that it's real"
01:34:42;01:34:48;"Don't let love come just to pass you by"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"Try"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"It's all we have to do"
01:34:52;01:34:56;"The number three song on the charts right now"
01:34:56;01:34:58;"Or on the Apple Music charts"
01:34:58;01:35:04;"Jungkook and Lotto with ""7"""
01:35:04;01:35:06;"Jake, you know where Jungkook comes from?"
01:35:06;01:35:08;"I'm gonna guess South Korea"
01:35:08;01:35:10;"Yep"
01:35:10;01:35:14;"And he's a member of a pretty well-known group"
01:35:14;01:35:16;"Built this bill?"
01:35:16;01:35:18;"Built this bill"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"And kind of UK two-step vibe"
01:35:26;01:35:30;"This is a throwback to early 2000s sound"
01:35:36;01:35:38;"I guess this is a summer song"
01:35:38;01:35:42;"We thought about who would be the best rapper for this summer song"
01:35:42;01:35:46;"One of the producers recommended Lotto"
01:35:54;01:35:58;"I'm getting the vibe this is a pro summer song"
01:35:58;01:36:00;"Yeah"
01:36:12;01:36:14;"It's the way that we could ride"
01:36:16;01:36:18;"We could match up in another life"
01:36:18;01:36:20;"It'll break me up another time"
01:36:20;01:36:22;"You're up around me and you give me life"

01:47:30;01:47:32;"- Yeah, that song, it's such an eerie feeling."
01:47:32;01:47:35;"- It doesn't make me feel good."
01:47:35;01:47:36;"- I mean, I guess she's saying, yeah."
01:47:36;01:47:38;"- It's just like kind of icky."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"- You said it doesn't make me feel good?"
01:47:40;01:47:41;"- No, it doesn't make me,"
01:47:41;01:47:43;"I don't know how to like feel."
01:47:43;01:47:46;"I just doesn't like, it's not like beautiful."
01:47:46;01:47:47;"It's not like a ballad."
01:47:47;01:47:49;"It's not like funky."
01:47:49;01:47:50;"It's a sort of like, ugh."
01:47:50;01:47:51;"- It's definitely an eerie."
01:47:51;01:47:52;"- It's herky jerky."
01:47:52;01:47:53;"I don't know."
01:47:53;01:47:54;"- It's like a threat."
01:47:54;01:47:56;"You know?"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"- Do you remember that one of the first big mashups"
01:47:58;01:48:00;"was that ""Mashed Up With The Strokes"" song?"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"- I don't remember that one."
01:48:02;01:48:05;"I remember like the Jay-Z ""Pavement"" one."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"- Wait, can we find it?"
01:48:07;01:48:09;"The genie in a bottle strokes mashup?"
01:48:09;01:48:10;"- That's pretty funny."
01:48:10;01:48:12;"Is that like girl talk did it?"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"Or is it just like, or even pre-that?"
01:48:14;01:48:19;"- It was called ""Strokes in a Bottle."""
01:48:19;01:48:23;"Genie in a, I think it was like last night."
01:48:23;01:48:25;"Plus, actually I can't remember at all."
01:48:25;01:48:28;"I just remember something about the Strokes,"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"Christina Aguilera, early mashup."
01:48:30;01:48:34;"- What year were those, that that started happening?"
01:48:34;01:48:35;"Like '02?"
01:48:35;01:48:39;"- No, I mean the big one,"
01:48:39;01:48:43;"the big one is the ""Gray"" album, which I believe-"
01:48:43;01:48:45;"- Oh, the Metallica Jay-Z?"
01:48:45;01:48:48;"- Well, Beatles Jay-Z that Danger Mouse did."
01:48:48;01:48:50;"That was like the real big one."
01:48:50;01:48:53;"And I think it's 2003."
01:48:53;01:48:56;"- Den-en-en-en-en-en-en-en."

01:49:39;01:49:42;"- Yeah. - Kind of."
01:49:42;01:49:42;"- Yeah."
01:49:42;01:49:45;"This was really state-of-the-art in '02."

01:50:00;01:50:02;"that I got in '02 or '03."
01:50:02;01:50:04;"I guess that came out in '03, '04."
01:50:04;01:50:07;"I don't remember, but I had an iPod"
01:50:07;01:50:09;"like full of this kind of stuff."
01:50:09;01:50:12;"- The classic or the iPod Shuffle and Nano?"
01:50:12;01:50:13;"- The classic, like whatever."
01:50:13;01:50:14;"- Or the original."
01:50:14;01:50:16;"- Like it came out. - It was full of terrible music."
01:50:16;01:50:17;"(laughing)"
01:50:17;01:50:19;"- Yeah, of course it was full of terrible music."
01:50:19;01:50:21;"I mean, it's not terrible."
01:50:21;01:50:23;"It was, but it had a lot of those mashups on."
01:50:23;01:50:26;"Like my buddy would download them off wherever"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"and yeah, put them on my iPod."
01:50:28;01:50:29;"Anywho."
01:50:29;01:50:30;"- Your buddy Osama Bin Laden?"
01:50:30;01:50:31;"Oh my God."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"- OBL was a big mashups head."
01:50:33;01:50:35;"- That actually sounds like something that could be real."
01:50:35;01:50:37;"Did you know that when they found"
01:50:37;01:50:39;"Osama Bin Laden's hard drive,"
01:50:39;01:50:44;"it actually had a stroke of genius?"
01:50:44;01:50:45;"(laughing)"
01:50:45;01:50:48;"That was the, he was just sitting in that house"
01:50:48;01:50:50;"in Pakistan just listening."
01:50:50;01:50:53;"He listened to it over 3,000 times."
01:50:53;01:50:54;"- Interestingly, he wasn't a Strokes fan"
01:50:54;01:50:55;"or a Christina Aguilera fan."
01:50:55;01:50:56;"- I never heard of it."
01:50:56;01:51:00;"- A stroke of genius."
01:51:00;01:51:01;"He was actually very disappointed"
01:51:01;01:51:03;"when he heard the originals."
01:51:03;01:51:04;"- He downloaded it by accident."
01:51:04;01:51:06;"(laughing)"
01:51:06;01:51:07;"Just looking for something."
01:51:07;01:51:09;"- He was just there listening to it."
01:51:09;01:51:11;"SEAL Team Six busted in the room,"
01:51:11;01:51:13;"said, ""By the way, that's a mashup."""
01:51:13;01:51:15;"(laughing)"
01:51:15;01:51:17;"- I mean, there's such a good scene"
01:51:17;01:51:20;"from the SEAL Team Six movie where they're all like,"
01:51:20;01:51:23;"they're all like prepping to like jump out of the plane"
01:51:23;01:51:24;"or come out of the water and this,"
01:51:24;01:51:26;"that's the song that starts."
01:51:26;01:51:28;"(laughing)"
01:51:28;01:51:30;"- It actually, that's how the SEAL Team Six movie opens."
01:51:30;01:51:33;"- Oh, he's like, no, no, it's Osama Bin Laden,"
01:51:33;01:51:36;"he's in his bunker and he just sort of puts on the headphones"
01:51:36;01:51:38;"and he just presses the stroke of genius"
01:51:38;01:51:39;"and he's just listening to it."
01:51:39;01:51:42;"And as he's doing it, he's sort of cut outside"
01:51:42;01:51:45;"and it's just like, oh, SEAL Team Six is mobilized."
01:51:45;01:51:46;"(laughing)"
01:51:46;01:51:48;"And he just has no idea."
01:51:48;01:51:51;"He's just there sitting there just vibing to the song."
01:51:51;01:51:53;"Maybe he's cleaning or sweeping with his headphones in"
01:51:53;01:51:55;"and then he's just like, boom."
01:51:55;01:52:01;"- Maybe we can tie this back to the Summer Girls LFO movie."
01:52:01;01:52:04;"Maybe it's Chet Hanks was a member of SEAL Team Six,"
01:52:04;01:52:06;"he's back in his hometown."
01:52:06;01:52:09;"Now he's working at the pool."
01:52:09;01:52:11;"(laughing)"
01:52:11;01:52:16;"It opens with the night they got Bin Laden"
01:52:16;01:52:20;"and then it like cuts to like next summer,"
01:52:20;01:52:21;"you gotta get a real job, man."
01:52:21;01:52:24;"He's like, I was on SEAL Team Six"
01:52:24;01:52:25;"and like that was over a year ago."
01:52:25;01:52:30;"You're back in the real world, man."
01:52:30;01:52:31;"You got him."
01:52:31;01:52:33;"- I guess I'm living in the past."
01:52:33;01:52:34;"- But it was a mashup."
01:52:34;01:52:36;"(laughing)"
01:52:36;01:52:41;"- The last words he heard is it's a mashup."
01:52:41;01:52:43;"- By the way, it's a mashup."
01:52:43;01:52:46;"- Oh my God."
01:52:46;01:52:49;"- CIA was like, we're picking up some chatter"
01:52:49;01:52:54;"that Bin Laden is a hold up at a house in Pakistan"
01:52:54;01:53:00;"and he's been listening to a stroke of genius quite a bit"
01:53:00;01:53:03;"and we're getting word from some of our people on the ground"
01:53:03;01:53:06;"that he thinks it's an original."
01:53:06;01:53:07;"He thinks that's an original?"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"The vocals barely even fit."
01:53:09;01:53:12;"Well, you know, he's an older guy."
01:53:12;01:53:14;"He doesn't know what the strokes are."
01:53:14;01:53:17;"Wait, you know the Strokes first album came out on 9/11?"
01:53:17;01:53:18;"- Yes. - That's right."
01:53:18;01:53:19;"- Oh."
01:53:19;01:53:20;"- All right."
01:53:20;01:53:22;"- We didn't start the fire."
01:53:22;01:53:25;"- Okay, yeah, this is too dark."
01:53:25;01:53:26;"Let's move on."
01:53:26;01:53:29;"Oh boy, crazy old world."
01:53:29;01:53:32;"The number one song this week."
01:53:32;01:53:33;"I don't think I have the,"
01:53:33;01:53:35;"we don't have the energy to get into this whole song."
01:53:35;01:53:36;"Everybody's talking about this song."
01:53:36;01:53:39;"Nick, you told me about this song last week."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"Oliver Anthony, Rich Men North of Richmond."
01:53:41;01:53:42;"- I don't have the energy."
01:53:42;01:53:43;"(laughing)"
01:53:43;01:53:44;"- I mean, it's true."
01:53:44;01:53:46;"It's true, this is a whole other episode."
01:53:46;01:53:47;"- If you haven't heard about this,"
01:53:47;01:53:49;"this is a viral song."
01:53:49;01:53:52;"He's a country guy and he's kind of like,"
01:53:52;01:53:54;"it's been called a blue collar anthem"
01:53:54;01:53:56;"as well as a right wing anthem."
01:53:56;01:53:58;"The song discusses a number of social issues,"
01:53:58;01:54:01;"including inflation taxes, welfare abuse,"
01:54:01;01:54:03;"and child trafficking."
01:54:03;01:54:06;"Notable right wing pundits, including Matt Walsh,"
01:54:06;01:54:09;"Benny Johnson, and Carrie Lake have championed the song."
01:54:09;01:54:11;"- This is time crisis."
01:54:11;01:54:13;"(laughing)"
01:54:13;01:54:14;"- I can't write."
01:54:14;01:54:16;"- It's crazy he gets into child trafficking."
01:54:16;01:54:18;"That is truly like."
01:54:18;01:54:20;"- Yeah, there's a line about like."
01:54:20;01:54:20;"- Epstein."
01:54:20;01:54:21;"- Alluding to."
01:54:21;01:54:23;"- Yeah, they're saying something about the miners."
01:54:23;01:54:25;"He says something about the miners,"
01:54:25;01:54:28;"which I think he's talking about actual miners"
01:54:28;01:54:30;"like in a cave, in a mine."
01:54:30;01:54:34;"And then he says, and miners with an O-R,"
01:54:34;01:54:36;"but not ones just on an island."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"- Oh."
01:54:37;01:54:37;"- On an island."
01:54:37;01:54:39;"- This is like the new, we didn't start the fire"
01:54:39;01:54:40;"in a way like this is the real."
01:54:40;01:54:41;"- He's calling out the elites."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"- Yeah, he's calling out the elite."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"- Yeah, but let's."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"- We'll go deep on this."
01:54:45;01:54:46;"- Ezra wants to get on."
01:54:46;01:54:48;"- Ezra just wants to like end the episode right now."
01:54:48;01:54:50;"- He wants to check out Sovette."
01:54:50;01:54:52;"(laughing)"
01:54:52;01:54:55;"- We'll go deep on this in two to four weeks as per."
01:54:55;01:54:58;"No, because I feel like this song is a real social phenomenon"
01:54:58;01:55:00;"and this needs time."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"- All right, we'll circle back."
01:55:01;01:55:03;"- We'll definitely circle back."
01:55:03;01:55:08;"Anyway, shout out to a Fall Out Boy,"
01:55:08;01:55:12;"Christina Aguilera, Seal Team Six,"
01:55:12;01:55:15;"and Oliver Anthony."
01:55:15;01:55:16;"We'll talk about this in the future."
01:55:16;01:55:18;"We'll see you in two weeks."
01:55:18;01:55:21;"Maybe we'll be back in person after our summer holidays."
01:55:21;01:55:22;"That'd be nice."
01:55:22;01:55:22;"- Oh yeah, hope so."
01:55:22;01:55:23;"- Sounds like fun."
01:55:23;01:55:24;"- I look forward to it."
01:55:24;01:55:25;"- All right, see you guys soon."
01:55:25;01:55:26;"- Peace."
