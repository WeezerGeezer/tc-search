00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis, back again. On this week's episode we have two very special guests."
00:06;00:13;"The legend Tom O'Neill, author of Chaos, Charles Manson, the CIA, and the Secret History of the"
00:13;00:19;"60s. Plus, we finally make direct contact with the Hershey/Reese's company. We'll be talking"
00:19;00:25;"to Ryan Reese, their director of social strategy. All this, plus marijuana t-shirts and McDonald's."
00:25;00:30;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:20;01:23;"Alright, Time Crisis back once again. How's everybody doing?"
01:23;01:24;"Doing pretty well."
01:24;01:31;"Lots been going on. Big news, couple weeks for the TC community. This is the type of stuff I"
01:31;01:36;"normally forget, but this one's so big that I was getting tagged and stuff for like three days."
01:36;01:43;"Did you guys see this picture of LeBron wearing head-to-toe Grateful Dead gear before a game?"
01:43;01:49;"Yes, I was tagged a few times. You know what's funny on my Instagram? You know Instagram,"
01:49;01:53;"there's the one setting, it's all the stuff you've posted, and then there's all the other"
01:53;01:56;"setting of stuff that you've been tagged in? Yes."
01:56;02:02;"It used to be everything on my Instagram was pictures of my paintings, you know?"
02:02;02:03;"Yeah."
02:03;02:09;"And now it's all very obscure Time Crisis riffs, memes, whatever you want to call it."
02:09;02:14;"So anyway, I think there's at least one image or video clip of LeBron wearing the"
02:14;02:21;"Grateful Dead bears shorts and sweatshirt with my name on it."
02:21;02:23;"And don't forget about the Crocs."
02:23;02:25;"Okay, was it also a dead Croc?"
02:25;02:29;"He was wearing the dead Crocs. I realize actually as I'm saying this that we never followed up"
02:29;02:36;"about the fact that you and I both have received, not Grateful Dead, but Jerry Garcia shoes"
02:36;02:36;"recently."
02:36;02:38;"I never got mine. I don't know what happened."
02:38;02:39;"Oh really?"
02:39;02:41;"What are they called? The Keens?"
02:41;02:43;"Keens. We got to rectify that."
02:43;02:50;"I ended up getting my pair of the Jerry Garcia Keens, which I know they asked for your info as"
02:50;02:56;"well, Jake, so you should be getting them. I got those the same day that I unexpectedly got a pair"
02:56;03:00;"of the Grateful Dead dunks, which I had very mixed feelings about."
03:00;03:05;"I think I said that I was going to talk about it on TC, but we forgot about it for the last one."
03:05;03:11;"But I've got a $2,000 pair of Grateful Dead dunks sitting in my home."
03:11;03:15;"Is that what they're still going for Seinfeld? A resident sneakerhead?"
03:15;03:18;"Oh my God. Let me check. What color, by the way?"
03:18;03:19;"I'm gonna go check right now, actually."
03:19;03:30;"While he does that, they are going from $844 to $2,600, depending on the color."
03:30;03:35;"I could do an unboxing video for you guys. It'll become an audio unboxing"
03:35;03:42;"little bit for the listeners at home. I'm holding the box. I'm showing the fellas."
03:42;03:47;"These are the Nike SBs. I'm opening. Here, listen to the rustling of the paper a little bit."
03:47;03:53;"That's the paper that is inside the box. Okay, I got the green ones."
03:53;03:58;"So the green ones are sort of the second most valuable. They're right in the middle."
03:58;04:05;"And those range anywhere from, yeah, from about $1,000 to $3,000, depending on the size."
04:05;04:06;"I'm a 10."
04:06;04:10;"10? Then you are sitting on a pair of $1,300 shoes."
04:10;04:14;"Damn. What's for $3,000? What's a rare size?"
04:14;04:16;"Your size 14, the biggest size."
04:16;04:18;"Yeah. Yeah. 10's right down the middle."
04:18;04:25;"Well, when I hold it in my hands, it's more attractive than when I just looked at a picture."
04:25;04:29;"Now that you have them, could you ever see yourself wearing them?"
04:29;04:35;"Well, I've got a bit of an issue is that I've always been a kind of like one pair of shoes guy."
04:35;04:39;"And it's funny because I'm not like, you know, some like just super down to earth person who"
04:39;04:44;"would be like, man, I don't care what I wear. Obviously, that's not me. I put thought into"
04:44;04:51;"trying to come up with provocative outfits and trying to stay on trend."
04:52;04:59;"But there's something about shoes for me that's always kind of where the practicality overrode"
04:59;05:03;"my sense of fashion and keeping things fresh. I like kind of looking in my closet and,"
05:03;05:08;"you know, looking at my different shirts. And, you know, if I have some time in the morning being"
05:08;05:14;"like, oh, that'd be cool. I felt good the other day that I put on a pair of khakis and I had this"
05:14;05:20;"like a brown Ralph Lauren pocket t-shirt that I bought at Macy's like five years ago and I put"
05:20;05:25;"it together. And some people are like, that's a nice color combination. You know, I like to put"
05:25;05:30;"together a little outfit here and there. But with shoes, it's always the last thing on my mind. I"
05:30;05:35;"like to just put on whatever is right outside the door. And I do have different shoes. Of course,"
05:35;05:40;"I have exercise shoes. So anyway, I appreciate shoes and yet I've never felt like I needed a lot"
05:40;05:45;"of them, even though, of course, a shoe can tie a whole outfit together. So I don't know if I'm"
05:45;05:49;"just lazy or too practical or something. But so basically, it's a long way of answering your"
05:49;05:55;"question when you say, could I picture myself wearing them? I'm just like, I have shoes that"
05:55;06:03;"I actually bought that I never wear because I basically wear the same pair of shoes every"
06:03;06:07;"single day. And occasionally I'll somehow like they'll get out of rotation and I'll just start"
06:07;06:13;"wearing another pair every single day. I even remember like being a kid once. There was like"
06:13;06:18;"a schoolyard bully who was making fun of another kid. The schoolyard bully was saying to the kid,"
06:18;06:25;"you loser, you wore those same shoes yesterday. Somehow I distinctly remember that I wasn't"
06:25;06:31;"being compassionate towards the victim. I just have this distinct memory of a kid making fun"
06:31;06:36;"of another kid. Maybe even for some reason, I disliked the kid getting made fun of or I thought"
06:36;06:40;"that maybe they were the real bully. I don't know. All I knew is that I listened to a kid say, man,"
06:40;06:44;"you wore those shoes yesterday. And I just remember like I wasn't even trying to stick"
06:44;06:47;"up for anybody. I was just like, what the are you talking about? Who would choose different"
06:47;06:52;"shoes every day? Just from a young age, I believe that shoes were in a fundamentally different"
06:52;06:57;"category than shirts or pants. I could understand a schoolyard bully coming up to a kid and saying,"
06:57;07:02;"you dirty schmuck, you wore that shirt yesterday. You know, at least that would track for me as a"
07:02;07:06;"cruel thing for a kid to make fun of. I just remember at this point, it wasn't even for me."
07:06;07:11;"I wasn't even trying to be like, hey, leave him alone. Not everybody has lots of pairs of shoes."
07:11;07:15;"I remember distinctly, I couldn't, my brain couldn't even go there yet because I was just"
07:15;07:20;"like, what the are you talking about? I always understood that you had one pair of shoes until"
07:20;07:25;"you until there was a hole in them. Then you'd get a new pair of shoes. You know what I'm saying?"
07:25;07:30;"Yeah. I don't like it when I'm wearing something that catches people's eyes. I don't like that."
07:30;07:34;"Like just going in like the grocery store. And if I'm wearing those green chunky donkeys,"
07:34;07:40;"I'm going to feel people like the shoes attracting people's eyes and attention."
07:41;07:47;"And then they're going to look at me and I just don't want to be analyzed by randos"
07:47;07:53;"because I'm wearing like funky green shoes. And those are definitely not an everyday shoe."
07:53;07:58;"No. You'd be getting analyzed every which way if you were these to the grocery store,"
07:58;08:01;"because you'd be getting people just being like, look at that eye popping color."
08:01;08:04;"You know, you might just get like an old lady or something saying,"
08:04;08:08;"look at you with your green shoes. Those are marvelous."
08:08;08:12;"Green's my favorite color. And you just be head down. It's like, not today, man."
08:12;08:19;"I'm busy. And then you probably have some other like deadheads being like, hey, come here. I once"
08:19;08:24;"bagged some groceries for Jerry Garcia on the day he died. And you're just like, man, you told me"
08:24;08:29;"that last week. Enough, man. I'm just trying to grab a bag of chips and get back to the studio."
08:29;08:33;"And then you'd have another category of people coming up to you uncomfortably being like,"
08:34;08:39;"wow, those shoes are worth one to three thousand dollars. Like that's weird, too."
08:39;08:44;"Somebody coming up to you just being like, you have a very expensive item on your person right"
08:44;08:49;"now. And I'm aware of it. Just want you to know. And the guys that are just silently watching you"
08:49;08:55;"closely, not saying a word. The creepiest of all. You feel their eyes on you. You know,"
08:55;08:59;"it's just it seems stressful. And then before you know it, it's the whole grocery store because you"
08:59;09:03;"have this whole other category of people who they weren't thinking twice about your green shoes,"
09:03;09:07;"but they noticed that weird energy that aura surrounding you. And then they're just they"
09:07;09:10;"become looky loose. What's going on with this guy with this guy? This green"
09:10;09:16;"pandemonium, pandemonium, just pandemonium at the Mill Valley."
09:16;09:25;"But again, now the stress of knowing that I have this expensive item in my home, can I really wear"
09:25;09:31;"it? And then also I do also feel, you know, I've said before, I am a fan of Nike and the fact that"
09:31;09:35;"they sent me these out of the blue. Obviously, they're not time crisis listeners. Otherwise,"
09:35;09:39;"they probably might have sent me the chunky donkeys instead of these. But either way,"
09:39;09:44;"they might know that I'm a fan of the Grateful Dead. Now, even though I've, you know, been"
09:44;09:49;"somewhat critical this shoe on the program, as we all have, by the way, I was just going along"
09:49;09:58;"with what Jake said. I love him. It's like when you watch that bully on the playground,"
09:58;10:04;"you didn't stand up for Nike when I was when I was back. You didn't have the spine to stand up"
10:04;10:09;"for that. It's the same thing. I was just so shocked by the premise of your argument. I was"
10:09;10:14;"went down an intellectual rabbit hole and I couldn't do the right thing. We can share the"
10:14;10:25;"women. We can share the wine. We can share what we got to use because we got to share all the"
10:25;10:51;"bad. Keep on rolling. Just to go. Keep on rolling. Much to. So, Nick, you have a pair of the Crocs,"
10:51;10:58;"right? Yeah. The Grateful Dead Crocs. So that's Chinatown Market, which is frankly, I think,"
10:58;11:03;"you know, Seinfeld might know a bit more about the company, but they're sort of like a"
11:03;11:11;"local L.A. I mean, do you call it streetwear? Online online ceramics. Yeah, it's an it's an"
11:11;11:16;"L.A. company. Yeah, they're kind of an emerging streetwear brand. They do a lot of collaborations."
11:16;11:23;"And so they released I guess they did their own collaboration with Grateful Dead and sort of I"
11:23;11:30;"think their look is a little more like less sort of dark, cool kind of online ceramics. It's like"
11:30;11:36;"pretty bright and vibrant and fun. Their logo is like a happy face. And so they did their their"
11:36;11:44;"Crocs that they did are like tie dyed Crocs, like tie dyed printed Crocs with the what did you guys"
11:44;11:48;"told me what they were called? What are those little like bits that you put on the Crocs?"
11:48;11:53;"Giblets? No, they're not called giblets. Well, the official term is giblets."
11:53;12:01;"They got a marching bear giblets. They got some rock climbing, the colorful holes that you hold."
12:01;12:09;"Yeah. And also just people understand if you're not a Crocs wearer giblets are basically flare"
12:09;12:14;"for your Crocs because you can picture a pair of Crocs. It has a bunch of holes in it. Right."
12:14;12:20;"So if you want to customize it, you can buy giblets either official or I'm sure unofficial"
12:20;12:25;"online. It could be flare that represents your personality. It could be I mean,"
12:25;12:28;"Vampire Weekend should probably start making some. I bet we have a lot of fans who wear Crocs."
12:28;12:32;"I've looked through like a big pile of them before where it's like anything you like. So,"
12:32;12:37;"you know, if if you know, if I was trying to decorate Jake's Crocs, maybe I'd find a paint"
12:37;12:44;"brush or artist palette, maybe a dog because you're a dog owner. Very cool. Maybe a guitar."
12:44;12:51;"This sounds so cool. Actually, if you ever need a cheap gift to give somebody,"
12:51;12:56;"but you can't afford to get them a pair of Crocs, just get them like three giblets that reflect"
12:56;13:00;"the things that they're into. And if they say, what am I supposed to do with them?"
13:00;13:04;"So put them on your Crocs. And if they say, well, I don't have any Crocs, be like, oh,"
13:04;13:09;"darn it. I thought you did. I'm on the Crocs giblets website. There are some pretty Jake"
13:09;13:14;"centric giblets here. There's a mountain range. I don't even know what Crocs look like. Oh,"
13:14;13:19;"come on. That's that's like a Birkenstock. You must know. I mean, they actually feel like a"
13:19;13:26;"painter's shoe. It's like a clog. Picture like a clog with like a rounded foot, except it's made"
13:26;13:31;"out of a kind of rubbery plastic and there's a series of holes in it. Oh, just look up Crocs"
13:31;13:36;"real quick. If you see these right now and say, I've never seen that in my life. This is like"
13:36;13:42;"Mariah Carey. All I want for Christmas level of checked out in this. I'll be very impressed."
13:42;13:47;"Oh, no. Yeah. I've seen those. I think of those as like, I'm trying to think like where I've"
13:47;13:51;"seen them, like do like people like in ERs wear them or like, no, like nurses."
13:51;13:56;"They might. Yeah. They're really comfortable. I think you're right, Jake. I think it is a"
13:56;14:03;"medical community type of shoe and and chefs and I would say painters. It's people that are on their"
14:03;14:07;"feet all day. Right. You know what I was thinking of getting, you know, like kitchens and restaurants,"
14:07;14:13;"there's they have like those that like thick rubber mat that's like an inch thick. Oh, yeah."
14:13;14:18;"I'm getting some of those because I'm usually standing in the same spot for like hours on end."
14:18;14:24;"So maybe I'll get one of those like inch thick, like kitchen mats and some Crocs."
14:25;14:31;"That's going to be heaven for your knees. Yeah, I find that like after standing for like three or"
14:31;14:36;"four hours in concrete wearing like beat up running shoes like and I'm here I am in my mid 40s almost,"
14:36;14:44;"you know, the backs are hurt. All of that. Yeah. So just switching gears. What so what do you think"
14:44;14:50;"that the backstory is with? So so I think taking a half hour, I think that would happen is that"
14:50;14:57;"there's this company Chinatown Market who made the collab, the Grateful Dead collab, Crocs and"
14:57;15:02;"gibbets. But they also did the sweatshirt and shorts that he was wearing. So somehow they"
15:02;15:09;"reached out to him. So they must have reached out to him. I have to think, though, that having"
15:09;15:18;"LeBron James during a finals game, well, yeah, with it all on is got to be one of the biggest"
15:18;15:23;"possible things to happen. I can't imagine they expected that they don't have that kind of weight,"
15:23;15:28;"you know, so I think that he must have a pair of stuff the way that Ezra gets a pair."
15:28;15:33;"But instead of looking at the green fuzzy chunky donkey going, I don't know if I'll wear this."
15:33;15:38;"He literally must have seen it and go, I'm just going to wear it all. I wonder if LeBron has"
15:38;15:42;"talked Grateful Dead with Bill Walton. Well, that's the big question is all these people are"
15:42;15:49;"tagging me. And clearly he's making huge waves wearing this outfit. Is there any information"
15:49;15:54;"that LeBron wore this outfit for a specific reason? Was he playing somewhere that had like"
15:54;16:00;"some Grateful Dead history? Oh, no. All the games are happening in the bubble, right?"
16:00;16:01;"Florida."
16:01;16:06;"I mean, the dead played there, but it's not particularly like dead country. I mean,"
16:06;16:10;"when did this happen? Yeah, he missed the days between by, you know, a few weeks. So that's"
16:10;16:14;"not what it was. So maybe he did just get it in the mail and he just wanted to throw it on. He"
16:14;16:19;"thought it looked cool. So yeah, that's a huge look for the, for Chinatown market. It's also"
16:19;16:25;"interesting the way that it works now where it's like, so Chinatown market teams up with the"
16:25;16:31;"Grateful Dead. Clearly Grateful Dead organization is very into like launching products lately."
16:31;16:36;"It's really like a lot at once. But anyway, it's interesting that I wonder what the backstory is"
16:36;16:40;"that Chinatown market, like maybe they're dead heads or they're fans or whatever. They're like"
16:40;16:43;"hit up the dead or the dead hits them up. Like, let's do something together."
16:43;16:48;"You guys make like cool, but then Chinatown market says, yeah, we should do a crock."
16:48;16:53;"So now you're bringing this like third party into it because the shoe is Chinatown market,"
16:53;16:54;"ex Grateful Dead, ex Crocs."
16:54;16:55;"Sounds complicated."
16:55;17:01;"They had to broker the deal. Yeah. Like Grateful Dead and Crocs negotiations had broken down many"
17:01;17:06;"times over the past five years. And Chinatown market invites them to Camp David to like hash"
17:06;17:10;"things out. Like you would think that a Grateful Dead crock would have been way before there's a"
17:10;17:15;"Grateful Dead skateboarding Nike dunk. There might've been a Grateful Dead crock and yet"
17:15;17:20;"took Chinatown market to put this together. And maybe ultimately Chinatown market is not,"
17:20;17:24;"it's just trying to do their own cool line. Cause Nick, you talked about the fact that"
17:24;17:29;"some of the gibbets on the Grateful Dead crock are climbing wall holds."
17:29;17:31;"Yes. Climbing wall holds, which I've never seen."
17:31;17:36;"Yeah. Well, that's funny because it's like, it is kind of like a weird crunchy symbol."
17:36;17:40;"Like you can imagine there being like a person who's, oh, I'm a dead head. And it's like,"
17:40;17:43;"well, what do you do on the weekends? Like, honestly, man, throwing my earbuds,"
17:43;17:50;"I throw on a spring 90 show and I just hit my local climbing wall. And you might be like,"
17:50;17:55;"yeah, all right. That all kind of makes sense to me. But there's no direct connection between"
17:55;18:00;"climbing walls and the Grateful Dead. No, I appreciate the randomness of it."
18:00;18:04;"Just while we're on the topic, I would do also want to shout out Keen's because I do really"
18:04;18:10;"like the brand Keen. I also appreciate that this shoe they said is not Grateful Dead. It's Jerry"
18:10;18:16;"Garcia. There's nice attention to detail on the box. The paper inside the box has Jerry's hand"
18:16;18:21;"print with the missing finger on it. And this is what the actual shoe looks like. You know,"
18:21;18:28;"so Keen's, that's a real outdoorsy brand. They make these kind of also moccasin hiking shoe type"
18:28;18:33;"things. I actually, I wear a pair of Keen's every day. I got sent a pair from the Newport Folk"
18:33;18:38;"Festival because somebody from the Newport Folk Festival heard me talking on the podcast,"
18:38;18:43;"Throwing Fits. Shout out Throwing Fits. That's a fashion podcast. And I was talking a lot about"
18:43;18:47;"how I wanted to get a pair of Keen's and this person at the Newport Folk Festival heard it"
18:47;18:53;"and was like, you know, we have a custom Newport Folk Festival pair of Keen's. And I was like,"
18:53;18:58;"sick. And I wear them every day because you slide them right on. You can wear socks. You don't have"
18:58;19:03;"to. You could stomp through some water. They dry nice. It's a great shoe. But so this Jerry"
19:03;19:11;"Garcia one, it kind of appears to be tie-dyed. And you see here, you've got Jerry's hand with"
19:11;19:17;"the missing finger. I'm sorry, Jerry Garcia is missing a finger. Oh, wow. I had no idea."
19:17;19:22;"Forgive me. No, no, no. That's fine, Seinfeld. We know there's only room for one Jerry in your life."
19:22;19:26;"I don't know what happened to his finger. Was he born without one?"
19:26;19:31;"On this show, Jake brought in the dead. You brought in the Seinfeld. So we got two Jerry's."
19:31;19:37;"Nick, you got to find a Jerry to rep. Salt. I do rep a Jerry Salt. Oh, you got Jerry Salt."
19:37;19:46;"And maybe I need a Jerry too. Jerry Heller, former manager of Eazy-E. Jerry Garcia actually"
19:46;19:52;"had a very traumatic childhood, Seinfeld. Within a span of, I think, a few years as a kid,"
19:52;19:58;"he watched his father drown in the Russian River in Northern California, where the Garcia family"
19:58;20:03;"had a kind of a little country house that the whole family would go out to. So he was fishing"
20:03;20:09;"with his dad and his father literally drowned in the river. What happened? I don't know if it's"
20:09;20:14;"anything other than some getting caught in the water. You don't think of that as a very treacherous"
20:14;20:19;"river. It's very placid. Maybe he hit his head. Maybe it was a stone. I don't know. But then"
20:19;20:25;"within the same few years, he and his brother, also probably out in the country because they"
20:25;20:29;"normally lived in the city in San Francisco at that phase of his life, he and his brother,"
20:29;20:34;"who's a little bit older, were horsing around. And the way his brother told the story is that"
20:34;20:42;"they were chopping wood and Jerry would put his finger on the stump as a joke and then somehow"
20:42;20:48;"through the horsing around, his brother actually cut off the middle finger of his right hand,"
20:48;20:54;"right? Of his right hand, which when you think about playing guitar is a way better place to"
20:54;20:59;"lose your middle finger than your left hand. If you're right handed. Yeah. If you're right"
20:59;21:03;"handed, because, you know, picture somebody playing guitar. If you're not a guitarist,"
21:03;21:07;"you know, your right hand just holds the pick. Most people only use their thumb and their"
21:07;21:12;"forefinger for the pick anyway. So you really only need two fingers. You can lose three fingers on"
21:12;21:16;"your right hand and still be decent at guitar. And then as long as you have access to your whole"
21:16;21:21;"left hand, you could be shredding up and down the neck. It would be really crazy if he played the"
21:21;21:25;"way he did and he was missing the middle finger on his left hand. You know, it's crazy, man. If"
21:25;21:30;"he had lost that finger on his left hand, the Grateful Dead might not exist. It would have"
21:30;21:35;"been harder for him to find his voice on the guitar, missing a finger. Goes to show, man,"
21:35;21:42;"history and life are super random. And then there would be no Crocs. No Crocs. I mean,"
21:42;21:49;"there'd be no time crisis. Let's be honest. It's true. What would this show be about if"
21:49;21:54;"the dead never existed? I never started Richard Pictures. Right. Father of the Bride is a"
21:54;22:00;"completely different album. You've said so yourself, dude. Richard Pictures was a huge"
22:00;22:06;"influence on Father. Absolutely. We would just be a couple boring ass dudes talking about plain Crocs."
22:06;22:13;"Yeah, but think about that. You're just a kid horsing around with your brother who's holding"
22:13;22:17;"an axe. What if his hand had been out a little bit further and his whole right hand had been"
22:17;22:22;"chopped off? Yep. I don't see him becoming the greatest guitar player of all time that way."
22:22;22:25;"Yeah. Or he's just horsing around the other hand. So many things could have happened."
22:25;22:30;"You know, I went to elementary school with a kid named Lawrence who lost his finger"
22:30;22:36;"by sticking it into a bicycle spoke that was moving. A bike had gone by and he stuck his"
22:36;22:42;"finger in when he was six or something. No, no, no. Oh my God. Brutal. I'll never forget it."
22:42;22:47;"You knew him before and after. No, I only knew him after. Oh, after. He was on my school bus and I"
22:47;22:53;"was like, what happened? And he said, I stuck my finger into a moving bicycle wheel. Oh my God."
22:53;22:58;"It was his baby finger. It was pinky. Oh, is that a Canadian thing? Calling it a baby finger?"
22:58;23:04;"I, you know, I don't know anymore. It's a baby toe, right? Yeah, it's a baby toe. But you call"
23:04;23:09;"pinky a baby finger? I never heard that. Or maybe I'm conflating it with Trump or something. I don't"
23:09;23:13;"know. Maybe it's a Canadian thing. But the last thing I'll say about this pair of Jerry Garcia"
23:13;23:18;"Keens is that I said they appear to be tie-dye, but they're not tie-dye. And this threw me for"
23:18;23:25;"a loop. And this also, I thought was a kind of a nice detail is that this shoe, I can't tell exactly"
23:25;23:30;"what the name is. Maybe it's called the Jerry Garcia Excelsior, but it's actually based on one"
23:30;23:36;"of his paintings. So it's not just random tie-dye, it's based on a painting he did. And you know"
23:36;23:42;"what this painting is called? In the city? Good guess, Jake, because I have no idea what it is."
23:42;23:47;"It's called New York at Night. Yeah, it looks like a cityscape. Yeah. So it's interesting that"
23:47;23:52;"this Jerry Garcia shoe has a weird connection to New York, a city the dead played many times,"
23:52;23:59;"but not a city you necessarily associate with him as a person. So this seemingly tie-dye Jerry"
23:59;24:02;"sandal has that New York nighttime energy."
24:26;24:31;"I wonder if anything will come of LeBron wearing this other than an uptick in sales for Chinatown"
24:31;24:36;"Market. I wonder if anybody's like, ""Who are those bears?"" I wonder if it gets more people"
24:36;24:41;"listening to the dead. Probably slight uptick for, you know, a day or two. And we've talked on the"
24:41;24:45;"show before about the fact that more than any other sport, there seems to be a basketball"
24:45;24:50;"Grateful Dead connection. Celtics player Jason Tatum has been on that Grateful Dead wave for a"
24:50;24:56;"little while. Is he a fan? He's a fan of the merchandising. I don't know about his musical"
24:56;25:02;"taste, but he wore the shoes that you have and he wore some jeans six months ago that have the"
25:02;25:09;"bears on them too. $1,500 Amiri jeans. Like I've said before, I think it's like silly that there"
25:09;25:14;"are people on like comment sections being like, ""This shoe is not in the spirit of the Grateful"
25:14;25:18;"Dead,"" when the truth is the Grateful Dead's been making original merchandise forever."
25:18;25:23;"They've never been like crazy purists. I wonder if there's ever been like a successful musician"
25:23;25:30;"who was like, ""I'm not doing t-shirts, man. I do one thing. Let's make music. You can listen to it"
25:30;25:36;"on the record. You can come see me in concert, but I'm not the f***ing Gap, okay? I'm not going to"
25:36;25:42;"waste my valuable time creating t-shirts for you to adorn your body with because as soon as you do"
25:42;25:48;"that, you're taking the image and you're taking away the beating heart of it, which is the music."""
25:48;25:52;"Who would do that? We would never hear of them because you need t-shirts to make it in this town."
25:53;25:59;"I could be wrong here, but I feel like merch was not really a thing in like the 60s and maybe early"
25:59;26:05;"70s. Definitely by the late 70s, it was like Kiss and everything. But like, if you felt like the"
26:05;26:12;"Doors in 1970, were they selling like Doors t-shirts? I don't know."
26:12;26:16;"That's a great question. By the 70s, you see pictures of kids in parking lots and they're"
26:16;26:23;"wearing like the Who baseball t-shirt. It existed, but were they selling it at the concerts in the"
26:23;26:29;"same quantities that they were by the 80s and 90s? They definitely made junky merchandise in the 60s."
26:29;26:35;"Go back as far as the early 60s, even the 50s. I think Elvis fans were buying like little plastic"
26:35;26:41;"weird things and there's Beatles junk. Yeah, there's definitely like lunch boxes and stuff,"
26:41;26:48;"but I don't think the t-shirt had the primacy though of being like the go-to merch item for"
26:48;26:52;"music in that era. But couldn't you see Jim Morrison doing that riff that you were doing"
26:52;27:01;"on stage? I don't want you to adorn a t-shirt with my image on it. Recently, the record company man"
27:01;27:07;"came to me and they said, ""Jim, we want to do a t-shirt."" And I said, ""Excuse me?"""
27:08;27:14;"""What is a t-shirt?"" Chinatown Market came to me and said, ""We want to do a line with you"
27:14;27:19;"and we want to make a Jim Morrison croc."" And I said, ""Why?"""
27:19;27:24;"I said, ""I'll pass on the crocs and the t-shirt, but I will take you up on the leather pants."""
27:24;27:26;"[Laughter]"
27:26;27:27;"T-shirt."
27:27;27:33;"I know. It's the reason Jim Morrison pronounces t-shirt very formally and in a very stilted way."
27:33;27:34;"[Laughter]"
27:34;27:35;"T-shirts."
27:35;27:37;"It's a new technology, yeah."
27:37;27:42;"I think we're going a tiny bit Keanu. We're turning him into a little bit of like,"
27:42;27:45;"""What is this t-shirt?"""
27:45;27:48;"That would have been an interesting casting instead of Mal."
27:48;27:54;"Keanu? Yeah, absolutely. Keanu is Jim Morrison. There's always been something"
27:54;28:00;"funny to me about solo artists with their merch, which is funny to say now. It's funny to say now"
28:00;28:06;"that there's definitely like the solo artist is more like the archetypal artist compared to bands,"
28:06;28:11;"which used to be like, ""What bands do you like?"" Now it's like, ""What music do you like?"""
28:11;28:16;"But I can imagine there being something awkward about, yeah, if you're like Neil Young and"
28:16;28:20;"they're just like, ""Here's the designs, Neil, for the tour."" And it's just like a picture of"
28:20;28:26;"your big-ass face. And it's just like, ""Neil Young, 1987 North American tour."" I can imagine"
28:26;28:32;"just looking at that and just being like, ""This is f***ing weird."" I think part of the reason that"
28:32;28:38;"solo artist merch is so funny to me is that obviously with a band, the fact that the band"
28:38;28:44;"has a name and band names tend to be kind of bizarre, it feels more normal. It's just like"
28:44;28:50;"a brand. I guess it's the same way that probably back in the day, we take it for granted, but there"
28:50;28:57;"used to be so many jokes about designer jeans because people found it so funny. Whenever that"
28:57;29:02;"started in the '70s, like Gloria Vanderbilt or something like that, the idea that you would just"
29:02;29:08;"walk around with somebody else's name on your ass was so funny to people. I even feel like there's"
29:08;29:14;"a... Is that a Run-DMC? Some early rap song. I remember having a line about, ""I don't want"
29:14;29:19;"nobody's name on my behind."" Yeah, just imagine you're somebody who'd never seen that before,"
29:19;29:23;"even somebody who's kind of interested in fashion. And suddenly you have commercials"
29:23;29:28;"where people are being like, ""Nothing comes between me and my Calvins."" And then just this"
29:28;29:33;"big name, Calvin Klein, on the back. We're so numb to it now. When you hear the name Calvin"
29:33;29:38;"Klein, you don't even consider the fact that that's a dude from the Bronx. That's the Run-DMC"
29:38;29:43;"lyric, ""Calvin Klein's no friend of mine. Don't want nobody's name on my behind."" Oh, it is Calvin"
29:43;29:50;"Klein. So that's Run-DMC. Although they were happy to rep Adolf Dassler, aka Adidas. But of course,"
29:50;29:54;"when you wear Adidas, you're not thinking about the fact that there's an old German guy named"
29:54;29:59;"Adolf Dassler. Do you remember in Back to the Future? No, is there a joke about that? Yeah,"
29:59;30:05;"well, Marty goes back to 1955 and then he gets hit by a car and is knocked unconscious. And then"
30:05;30:10;"his mom, who's 17, brings him into the house. She's like, ""Calvin, are you okay?"" He's like,"
30:10;30:14;"""Why are you calling me Calvin?"" She's, ""Calvin Klein. It says all over your underwear. That's"
30:14;30:19;"your name, right?"" Oh, yeah, you're right. That's a really good joke. And also, that's some real"
30:19;30:24;"s***. That is probably what would happen if you went back in time wearing Calvin Klein underwear"
30:24;30:29;"and got hit by a car and your mom found you. Your 17-year-old mom found you. There is one band that"
30:29;30:36;"we have found that never made merch, and that's Fugazi. Never made merch? Wait, they didn't even"
30:36;30:42;"make T-shirts? Really? Never made merch. So much so, yes, that I've definitely seen a Fugazi T-shirt."
30:42;30:49;"Yes, all homemade. You know, there was a movie that Matthew McConaughey made called Mud. And"
30:49;30:54;"the character in Mud, they wanted to have a Fugazi shirt. And so it had to be homemade,"
30:54;31:00;"because there were none. And when they called Fugazi to get permission, they never got a call"
31:00;31:05;"back, and they couldn't get a shirt because they never made shirts. So there is documented,"
31:05;31:10;"Fugazi has never made their own merch, period. That's pretty hardcore."
31:11;31:14;"When we have nothing left to give"
31:14;31:20;"There'll be no reason for us to live"
31:20;31:25;"When we have nothing left to lose"
31:25;31:31;"You will have nothing left to use"
31:31;31:34;"We are nothing"
31:34;31:38;"You have no control"
31:38;31:39;"We are nothing"
31:39;31:43;"You have nothing to lose"
31:43;31:47;"Well, I'm going to do a hard left turn right now. We talked recently on the program about the TC"
31:47;31:52;"Book Club and the TC Book Club Civil War, and how just things really got out of control. But at"
31:52;31:58;"least two of us read the same book. And that's me and Jake. We both read Chaos, Charles Manson,"
31:58;32:03;"the CIA and the History of the '60s by Tom O'Neill. Jake, I believe you just finished it, right?"
32:03;32:05;"I did. I finished it a few days ago."
32:05;32:11;"We both love this book, and we're very lucky to have the author Tom O'Neill on the program."
32:11;32:17;"He's done some really in-depth interviews recently. If you want to hear him talk for a"
32:17;32:22;"really long time about the book, he was on Joe Rogan not that long ago. We got so many questions"
32:22;32:27;"for him. But above all, as we said last time, just to refresh your memory, one of the things that I"
32:27;32:32;"found so fascinating about Tom O'Neill is not just that he wrote a fascinating book. It's not a"
32:32;32:36;"conspiracy theorist book in the sense of being like an unhinged person just looking for clues."
32:36;32:43;"It's a very well-written, well-researched, sober analysis of inconsistencies in the official story"
32:43;32:48;"of what happened with Charles Manson. He's an incredibly restrained writer, actually."
32:48;32:54;"He refuses to make connections if he can't prove it. It's a very sober analysis of the story,"
32:54;32:58;"and you find out so much. But also, an amazing part of it, which I want to ask him about,"
32:58;33:04;"is the fact that this is a dude who started writing a magazine article in 1999 that was"
33:04;33:07;"supposed to take a couple months and ended up- For Premier Magazine."
33:07;33:12;"For Premier Magazine, which no longer exists. Just trying to write something about the 30th"
33:12;33:17;"anniversary of the Manson murders. Well, he got his book out in time for the 50th anniversary"
33:17;33:23;"because he spent 20 years doggedly pursuing this story. Anyway, we're very lucky to have him on,"
33:23;33:27;"so let's get Tom on the phone. Now, let's go to the Time Crisis"
33:27;33:32;"Hotline. Hey, Tom."
33:32;33:36;"Hi, how you doing? Hey, how's it going? Welcome to Time Crisis."
33:36;33:42;"Oh, thanks for having me. How you guys doing? Oh, not bad. I'm Ezra, and that's my co-host,"
33:42;33:46;"Jake. Hey. Where are you calling from, Tom? Do you still live out by the beach?"
33:46;33:50;"I live in Los Angeles, but I'm in New Jersey right now, South Jersey."
33:50;33:55;"My folks have a house in Cape May, and I'm visiting some of the family here,"
33:55;34:01;"sitting out on the deck to try to keep it quiet. Oh, beautiful. Yeah, you grew up in Philly, right?"
34:01;34:05;"Yeah, yeah, in Philadelphia. Very cool. Well, so Jake and I are both huge"
34:05;34:11;"fans of the book, and I just want to start out by congratulating you on what really is just a"
34:11;34:12;"massive achievement. Thank you."
34:12;34:19;"Your incredible research over 20 years. I mean, so many questions. It's hard to know where to begin,"
34:19;34:25;"but maybe just for our listeners, we kind of gave them the basic backstory about how you were"
34:25;34:30;"contracted to write something about the 30th anniversary of the Madsen-Murgister Premier"
34:30;34:36;"Magazine all the way back in 1999. Could you maybe tell us one of the first turning points"
34:36;34:41;"in your research where you realized this was more than a magazine article that you'd be able"
34:41;34:46;"to hand in after a few months? I guess the first time it kind of occurred"
34:46;34:51;"to me that things were a little bit out of whack with the official narrative was my first meeting"
34:51;34:58;"with the prosecutor, Vincent Bogliosi, who also wrote the book Helter Skelter about the case,"
34:58;35:04;"you know, about the crimes, the investigation and the trial and the aftermath. So he very"
35:04;35:10;"graciously invited me to his house, spent about six hours with me discussing the case. And,"
35:10;35:15;"you know, I'd read Helter Skelter for the first time. I was never interested in the crimes or the"
35:15;35:20;"case. I only did it because, you know, I had an assignment and I had to do some background."
35:20;35:26;"And I knew enough then at the end of that day that he hadn't told me anything, kind of. They"
35:26;35:32;"hadn't already told a million times in documentaries and his own book and speaking engagements."
35:32;35:39;"So at the very end of the interview, I did what we call the ""Hail Mary"" pass, where I said to him,"
35:39;35:44;"""Look, I'd love if you could share something with me that's never been reported about this before."""
35:44;35:50;"It's 30 years later and I just don't want to do, you know, a rehash here. And we could go off the"
35:50;35:55;"record if you'd like. So he thought about it for a minute or two and then he said, ""Turn off your"
35:55;36:00;"recorder."" And he told me an anecdote. Well, he told me about some evidence that had been taken"
36:00;36:08;"from the scene that he had represented as something quite different in his book. At the time, it was"
36:08;36:15;"salacious and kind of fascinating and also pretty horrible. But I didn't know that it had, you know,"
36:15;36:21;"any repercussions except for the fact that it nagged at me that he was kind of acknowledging"
36:21;36:29;"that he changed one fact in the case. And that kind of later on in the following weeks, when I"
36:29;36:36;"was doing more and more interviews, reading more documents and seeing discrepancies and anomalies"
36:36;36:41;"and stuff, I kept going back to that and thinking, ""Well, if he changed that, you know, what else did"
36:41;36:50;"he change?"" And that kind of opened a door into a world of kind of astonishment on my part that"
36:50;36:57;"something that everybody thought they knew so well had been actually manufactured significantly."
36:57;37:04;"And the truth was very different than what was told. And it's one thing if you do it in a book,"
37:04;37:09;"it's another thing if you do it in a trial where people's lives are at stake. And no matter what"
37:09;37:15;"you think about the defendants, Charlie and his followers, they deserve the presumption of"
37:15;37:23;"innocence and also a fair trial. And the death penalty was at play. So the fact that he fabricated"
37:23;37:30;"evidence, suborn perjury, withheld evidence, and did all these things seemed really important to me."
37:30;37:35;"That kind of sent me off in what became, you know, I had no idea at the time that a three-month"
37:35;37:40;"magazine assignment was going to turn into a 20-year odyssey. But that was kind of the first"
37:40;37:45;"kind of ""Oh, s***"" moment where I'm like, ""There's something going on here that I got to figure out"
37:45;37:47;"what it means."""
37:47;37:52;"And that's something that I've been very curious about, because your background at the time,"
37:52;37:57;"so most of your adult life until you started this article, you'd been writing a lot about the"
37:57;38:01;"entertainment industry. You'd primarily been a magazine writer."
38:01;38:07;"Yeah, I had written mostly about celebrities and film and television production. Before that,"
38:07;38:13;"I had done a little bit of kind of general news reporting for the Village Voice and the New York"
38:13;38:20;"Daily News. But I kind of had made my mark and made a living in entertainment journalism. And"
38:20;38:26;"the magazine I was working for, where I was on the masthead, was called Us Magazine. It still"
38:26;38:32;"exists today. But when I worked there, which was until I got shortly before I started this,"
38:32;38:36;"it was a monthly magazine. Jan Wenner, the owner of Rolling Stone, owned it."
38:36;38:41;"And we actually did long stories. I was doing 5,000-word pieces. And I started doing"
38:41;38:46;"investigative pieces about the entertainment industry, which were a big relief for me,"
38:46;38:50;"because I was really getting burnt out on talking to movie stars about their movie"
38:50;38:57;"theses and kind of stroking egos and stuff to get information. And then Jan sold the—or he"
38:57;39:02;"didn't sell the magazine, but he revamped it and turned it into a weekly, much more tabloidy kind"
39:02;39:07;"of thing. So I let my contract go, and a bunch of other people did. And they all went to a film"
39:07;39:13;"magazine called Premiere. So this was the assignment I got from them. But in between,"
39:13;39:19;"there's a magazine called Details. I did do my first true crime story for them. I reported on"
39:19;39:26;"a woman who was murdered in California, who was Miss Hollywood. It was an unsolved murder. It was"
39:26;39:29;"a pretty amazing story. - That's Rebecca Schaeffer?"
39:29;39:31;"- No, no. I actually done a story. - Oh, that's a different story?"
39:31;39:34;"- That was a story about celebrity stalkers. So yeah, I guess actually that was kind of a"
39:34;39:40;"true crime story too. But this was about an unknown woman from Michigan who had moved out"
39:40;39:47;"to Los Angeles to be the next Madonna, and she just wasn't talented. Got kind of corrupted by"
39:47;39:54;"the sleazy underbelly of Hollywood and ended up being stabbed and left in a lot in Fresno."
39:54;40:00;"Wasn't even discovered for two or three days. And the weird coincidence was her body was found"
40:00;40:06;"50 years to the day that the Black Dahlia murder occurred in Hollywood. And the parallels between"
40:06;40:12;"the two cases were kind of fascinating. And I was really kind of frustrated because I never saw"
40:13;40:18;"her murder, and I kept thinking I was onto it. And it began, what I had no idea was going to"
40:18;40:24;"become a pattern in my life of going way too deep into a story and letting it take over."
40:24;40:30;"Luckily, that one was only about six months. But after what happened with the next job, I look back"
40:30;40:34;"in retrospect and think, ""Ah, yeah, that's where it all began when I couldn't solve it."" Her name"
40:34;40:48;"was Jill Weatherwax. [Music]"
40:48;41:02;"[Applause]"
41:26;41:31;"One thing that I think is very cool about your writing style is that you deeply are not a"
41:31;41:36;"conspiracy theorist. And I've seen in your other interviews, you've referenced the fact that"
41:36;41:42;"you've gotten some criticism for it because there's a frustration in this era of so many"
41:42;41:48;"true crime docs and podcasts and stuff. A lot of people want to be able to walk away from a book"
41:48;41:53;"saying, ""And that's what really happened."" Because it's become entertainment for people. So it's"
41:53;41:58;"really fun the same way that you would watch, you would read a mystery novel. You want to find out"
41:58;42:03;"who did it in the end, and that's the satisfaction. But that's not exactly,"
42:03;42:06;"you're a little too rigorous for that. Is that fair to say?"
42:06;42:12;"Yeah. Well, that's again, it's also why it took 20 years because I did think, I kept thinking"
42:12;42:17;"I was just around the corner from finding the truth. And I think like five or six years into"
42:17;42:23;"this after I'd already accumulated quite a bit of debt and a number of enemies and stuff. And my"
42:23;42:29;"agent just said to me, he goes, ""You might never find the smoking gun. You've got a lot of little"
42:29;42:37;"smoking pistols."" He said, ""Just present everything you have that undoes the kind of acceptance story,"
42:37;42:44;"and that's enough."" And it took me a while to agree to it. And then once I did, another five"
42:44;42:49;"years later, probably, then I was able to, well, I had the help of a great collaborator, figure out"
42:49;42:55;"how to do it and how to present it without resolution. And a lot of the criticism of the"
42:55;43:02;"book is that, but luckily I think a lot of people get it that I could speculate a lot more and be"
43:02;43:07;"much more conspiratorial and present something that has a beginning and a middle and an end."
43:07;43:13;"But I think there's just as many people who are happy to be kind of respected enough to not be"
43:14;43:20;"spoonfed and let them reach their own conclusions. I'm hoping, and it might be a little grandiose on"
43:20;43:26;"my part, but I'm hoping that the stuff that I put out there into the world is followed up with other"
43:26;43:34;"people independently or journalists or investigators who take kind of the path I laid and keep going,"
43:34;43:39;"and maybe find the answer at some point. Or maybe I kept thinking I was never going to do anything"
43:39;43:44;"on this subject after the book came out, but sure enough, I think I'm going to be doing a second book"
43:44;43:49;"or something like that. Also about the Manson murders or- A lot of the stuff that didn't end"
43:49;43:55;"up in the book, it still kills me because I think a lot of it's real important. That's amazing. So"
43:55;44:00;"one of the most fascinating things that, when I'm trying to explain what's interesting about this"
44:00;44:05;"book to people, and the first thing I tell them is, first of all, did you know that Charles Manson"
44:05;44:10;"and his followers were arrested many times before and after the murders and always seemed to be"
44:10;44:15;"let go? Which most people don't know. So that's very strange, right? And the fact that you"
44:15;44:20;"diligently uncovered so much of that, at the very least, proves that there was something weird"
44:20;44:24;"happening there. But one of the most fascinating things, which the book is named after, is the fact"
44:24;44:30;"that CIA had this Operation Chaos, which the public knows some details about, but as you say in the"
44:30;44:37;"book, a lot of the files were destroyed. But in the same month, the FBI started their COINTELPRO"
44:37;44:43;"program again, and the CIA started Chaos, and they both happened to open their first offices"
44:43;44:48;"in San Francisco. You also talk about that it's been widely underreported that Charles Manson and"
44:48;44:55;"the family spent a whole year in San Francisco before going down to LA. And you very elegantly"
44:55;45:00;"trace his steps and talk about the people he came into contact with, some of whom did have"
45:00;45:06;"connections to the CIA, and perhaps to the MKULTRA program. This is just something that I happened to"
45:06;45:10;"be thinking, because I was watching this movie, and in some ways I'm just interested in this time"
45:10;45:17;"period. So there was the same week that the Manson murders happened, one of the other most infamous"
45:17;45:23;"serial killers of all time, the Zodiac Killer, sent his first letter to the San Francisco Chronicle"
45:23;45:31;"on August 1st, 1969. At the very least, on this show, we mostly talk about the Grateful Dead and"
45:31;45:36;"McDonald's, so we're just about vibes here, to a large extent. I'm definitely not trying to say,"
45:36;45:42;"""Prove to me that the Zodiac Killer had something to do with MKULTRA,"" but I was just curious,"
45:42;45:47;"because one thing I love about the book is you just give people an insight into what the vibe"
45:47;45:53;"was. This period in American history, this period in California, this period in LA, did that ever"
45:53;45:58;"cross your radar that, I mean, obviously August 1969, it's a hell of a month, but Woodstock was"
45:58;46:04;"that month too. For some reason, I just suddenly was picturing, you're just somebody living in"
46:04;46:10;"California, your local respected newspaper gets sent a cipher from a weird serial killer that"
46:10;46:15;"people at home are trying to decode, and they're scared he's going to kill again, and then on"
46:15;46:20;"August 8th, a history teacher and his wife crack the code, and you're kind of like, ""Okay, maybe"
46:20;46:25;"that's going to be the end of that."" The next day, you hear about four people ritually murdered in"
46:25;46:30;"Los Angeles. Are there any connections to that? I know you don't mention the book, but that must"
46:30;46:35;"have felt like a truly psychotic moment in American history, all these things happening at the same"
46:35;46:39;"time. Did you have any leads related to that? Are there people who believe there's a connection?"
46:39;46:46;"Yeah, yeah. There are people out there who have been spending as much time as I spent on this,"
46:46;46:53;"my 20 years, double that on trying to connect the Zodiac to the Manson family. There's a couple of"
46:53;46:59;"serious researchers who started writing me probably in the early 2000s when they heard about"
46:59;47:06;"what I was doing. Most of them are convinced that Bruce Davis, who was one of Manson's followers,"
47:06;47:13;"was a Zodiac killer or was somehow working in tandem with a Zodiac killer. Davis is a really"
47:13;47:19;"interesting, strange character. He's actually, I think, the only family member that I interviewed"
47:19;47:28;"in prison face-to-face. I didn't ask him if he was a Zodiac killer. I knew going in, I'd learned by"
47:28;47:33;"then that it's hard to get them to say anything off script from what they've said in all their"
47:33;47:39;"parole hearings. Because if they give you any kind of new information and you publish it, then the"
47:39;47:42;"first thing the parole board's going to say, if it's important information, is, ""Why did you"
47:42;47:48;"withhold that? Because we give you an opportunity."" I mean, some of these guys like Tex and he have"
47:48;47:53;"had 30 or 40 parole hearings at this point. I looked into it a little bit, and it's one of"
47:53;47:58;"those things that I knew that if I looked into it anymore, I'd never finish the book."
47:58;48:05;"So there's some validity to Davis's kind of, some of the stuff he was up to, and none of it's in the"
48:05;48:12;"book. At the time, he was suspected in a couple other murders. I didn't get enough kind of"
48:12;48:18;"documentation that any of it was valid enough to pursue, but I did keep in touch with a couple of"
48:18;48:23;"the researchers, and I shared information with them. I actually, it occurs to me now, I haven't"
48:23;48:28;"heard from them since the book came out. I'm curious if they've read the book and if it's"
48:28;48:32;"helped or hurt. I think if it helped, I would have heard from them, but, or they could be dead,"
48:32;48:34;"because they've been doing it a long time. A lot of these people died."
48:34;48:36;"- Right, that's what I'm talking about."
48:36;48:41;"And also, one question, and Jake, you brought this up when we first talked about the book,"
48:41;48:48;"is were you at all thinking or haunted by the figure of Robert Graysmith, who was portrayed"
48:48;48:54;"by Jake Gyllenhaal in the Zodiac movie, who also ended up writing a big book and uncovering a lot"
48:54;48:59;"of information? He was a cartoonist in San Francisco who ended up also dedicating a lot of"
48:59;49:04;"his life to writing about an infamous serial killer. - Yeah, that did haunt me. I didn't know"
49:04;49:10;"a whole lot about Zodiac until I started getting these, you know, correspondences. So I read the"
49:10;49:16;"book and then I saw David Fincher's movie, which was fantastic. And what was interesting is David"
49:16;49:24;"Fincher's parents are very close to Roger Smith. If you remember, Roger Smith was Manson's federal"
49:24;49:27;"parole officer in San Francisco. - Wait, they knew him personally?"
49:27;49:32;"- Yeah, yeah. In fact, Roger Smith told me that in one of my first meetings with him. I can't"
49:32;49:36;"remember how it came up, but he talked about knowing them back then. And he wanted to know"
49:36;49:42;"if I knew David Fincher, 'cause I lived in LA. And I said, ""No, I never met him or anything."""
49:42;49:47;"I almost called not him, but his parents, because I think they were even friends with"
49:47;49:54;"Smith around the time he was supervising Manson. And I didn't, you know, it just seemed out of line"
49:54;49:58;"at the time. Actually, it's one of those things now I should now go back and look and see exactly"
49:58;50:03;"what Roger said to me. And maybe, I don't know if Fincher's parents are still alive. I have no"
50:03;50:09;"idea if David Fincher's even aware of that or aware of my book. But yeah, I'm sure his parents"
50:09;50:14;"probably told him, 'cause he's the kind of guy who's probably curious about something like that"
50:14;50:19;"in their history. So I'd love to hear what he thought of his parents' relationship."
50:19;50:23;"- That must've been trippy for you, 'cause Zodiac, when did that come out? Like 2007?"
50:23;50:25;"- Yeah. - Something like that?"
50:25;50:29;"So I'm just picturing, here you are eight years deep on this book,"
50:29;50:34;"like smack in the middle of this journey. And as you talk about in the book, a lot of times"
50:34;50:38;"you're questioning yourself, if you were making the right decision by doggedly pursuing it."
50:38;50:45;"And eight years deep, a movie comes out directed by a guy whose parents were friends with Charles"
50:45;50:52;"Manson's parole officer. That's about a guy whose life gets crazy as he writes a book about the"
50:52;50:54;"Zodiac killer. - Exactly."
50:54;50:56;"- That must've been wild to see that at that moment in your life."
50:56;51:01;"- Yeah, I remember being kind of awed by the movie, 'cause the movie was so well done,"
51:01;51:07;"but also being horrified by it. I kept saying, ""Everything doesn't have to be about me."""
51:07;51:13;"Stop being so self-centered and just enjoy the movie. But yeah, it was a weird kind of coincidence."
51:13;51:19;"The same thing happened when I read Michelle McNamara's book. I still haven't seen the"
51:19;51:23;"documentary, which I heard is pretty good. But I think I read that before my, I think her book"
51:23;51:29;"came out shortly before mine. I'm still not sure how she died, but I think she just got so caught"
51:29;51:35;"up in the horror of what happened to all these women and trying to nail down who did what,"
51:35;51:42;"who was the killer. So I see myself in all those kinds of people and get scared."
51:42;51:47;"And a couple of times, I can't remember examples right now, but there were other books and movies"
51:47;51:52;"similar to that, kind of that genre. - I can only imagine. And also,"
51:52;51:56;"I was really struck by one part of the book, because I think one thing that's so cool about"
51:56;52:01;"your book is that it's so, like we said, rigorously researched. And then there's a"
52:01;52:07;"tiny bit about your own life. Just maybe like 0.5% of the book is about what was happening with you"
52:07;52:13;"in your life. But it's the story of what you uncovered, but it's also the story of a person"
52:13;52:18;"who pursued something for 20 years. And there's one brief moment where you talk about this Don"
52:18;52:23;"DeLillo, 1988 novel, Libra, and you talk about this character, Nicholas Branch, a retired CIA"
52:23;52:31;"analyst, and how the agency paid for him to build a home office, which he described as the book-filled"
52:31;52:38;"room, the room of documents, the room of theories and dreams. And he says that he realizes that as"
52:38;52:43;"he's researching Lee Harvey Oswald, his ultimate subject isn't crime or politics, it's men in small"
52:43;52:49;"rooms. And you say you really identified with this character, the guy in the small room, just"
52:49;52:56;"keesing through endless documents, looking for the truth. And I mean, it is funny. I'm sure this is,"
52:56;53:01;"you've probably talked about this before, that as somebody who missed their deadline by 20 years,"
53:01;53:06;"you still weirdly, you know, talking about something that happened 50 years ago,"
53:06;53:12;"you still weirdly managed to get your book out in a moment when a story about somebody"
53:12;53:17;"pursuing the truth for 20 years has like this deeper resonance, you know, like,"
53:17;53:21;"look how much the world has changed in the 20 years you wrote that book. Like,"
53:21;53:28;"I imagine even your methods of research changed dramatically from 1999 till 2019 with access to"
53:28;53:32;"the internet and stuff. So I guess I'm also, this is maybe kind of a weird question, but"
53:32;53:40;"in the 20 years you spent researching something, thinking about various connections and the way"
53:40;53:44;"the world works, questioning if you're on the right path, but realizing how much time it takes"
53:44;53:49;"to sometimes uncover connections in the truth. Did you learn anything about the meaning of life?"
53:49;53:56;"Wow. Nobody's asked me that before. I got to think about it a second. I mean,"
53:56;53:58;"yeah, maybe that's too deep, but yeah."
53:58;54:03;"Well, no, no, it's a good question. I mean, believe me when I get something like that,"
54:03;54:08;"that I haven't thought about. I mean, I do write, I think, in the book about a really low moment in"
54:08;54:14;"my life when my first book publisher canceled the deal. And then they sued me for the return"
54:14;54:20;"of the advance, which was such a tremendous, not only setback, but crush to, you know,"
54:20;54:24;"it was just a blow. Cause I thought that the real reason they were canceling the book wasn't"
54:24;54:29;"because it was late, but because they thought I'd gone crazy or had lost faith in me. And I was"
54:29;54:35;"walking down the street with a friend and I really couldn't have been any lower. And he asked me if I"
54:35;54:40;"thought it was all worth it. And at that point it was 2013, I think. So I was like 14 years in"
54:40;54:46;"and I said, I wouldn't have traded those 13 previous years for the world because they were"
54:46;54:53;"the most exciting 13 years of my life because I was chasing something that I believe was important."
54:53;54:58;"And I had validation, but I kept finding stuff. It just took forever to find. Well, I think the"
54:58;55:04;"lesson, yeah, as perseverance pays off, if you trust your gut, but I sacrificed a lot, you know,"
55:04;55:08;"I missed so much in my life. Well, but the question about that specifically,"
55:08;55:12;"that's also interesting is that, so you were roughly 40 when this whole journey started,"
55:12;55:17;"right? Yeah, I was turned 40 the day, the day after my 40th birthday, I got the call"
55:17;55:21;"from premier magazine asking me to do this story. I guess it's also interesting too,"
55:21;55:26;"that, that you had described the, even though obviously it's tremendous ups and downs,"
55:26;55:32;"but there's very few people from any walks of life who described age 40 to 53 as the 13 most"
55:32;55:38;"exciting years of their life. And when you were in the previous year, you were doing stuff that"
55:38;55:42;"some people would think was very glamorous, like, you know, interviewing celebrities and stuff."
55:42;55:49;"And yet the next 13 years, it seems like you spent a lot of time taking old people to Denny's"
55:49;55:56;"and asking them questions, driving to God knows where middle of nowhere to find people. And yet"
55:56;56:03;"you found this purpose in middle age that ultimately you wouldn't have traded for anything"
56:03;56:07;"that kind of elevated your life in a sense. Yeah. And ironically, I was miserable most of"
56:07;56:14;"those 13 years. And I had, you know, so many moments where I questioned my sanity"
56:14;56:20;"and my reasons for doing it. But it's also in the book, I carried a list in my pocket of the"
56:20;56:26;"important fines I had. And, you know, nothing in, again, it sounds kind of presumptuous of me to"
56:26;56:33;"say, but nothing I had ever done prior to this book was important. I mean, relatively speaking,"
56:33;56:37;"I mean, I wrote really good stories, I think, especially some of the investigative pieces about"
56:37;56:42;"the industry. I wrote about sexism at Saturday Night Live, and I won a bunch of awards from a"
56:42;56:47;"bunch of women's organizations. That was all important. But there was nothing that, nothing"
56:47;56:52;"seemed, I mean, this was about the government and it was about malfeasance by people who were"
56:52;56:58;"supposed to trust, you know, law enforcement, the judicial system, you know, the people who"
56:58;57:05;"are supposed to protect us. And that was another life lesson. I mean, I naively went into this,"
57:05;57:11;"you know, I was raised by pretty left wing democratic parents and pretty open minded"
57:11;57:17;"and skeptical, but I was nowhere near skeptical enough when I encountered the cops and the"
57:17;57:24;"corruption in the courts and the cops and even the judges in this case to really believe it"
57:24;57:29;"could have happened because I did have a naivety that I don't have anymore. I'm much more"
57:29;57:48;"suspicious and cynical. So I guess that was a life lesson too."
57:48;58:02;"Just to keep the population down. That would lead you now. And that's why I'm hanging around."
58:02;58:13;"So you'll be good to me, and I'll be good to you. And in this land of conditions, I'm not above"
58:13;58:19;"suspicion. I won't attack you, but I won't bash you. Tom, there was a really interesting"
58:19;58:23;"short section of the book that I wish I could read more about sometime,"
58:23;58:29;"which is when you hired a PI to help you track down former members of the family that were"
58:29;58:35;"changed their name and were living in obscure places in the Pacific Northwest. What was that"
58:35;58:41;"like when you would show up at their house and knock on the door? What was going on with these"
58:41;58:48;"people? That was probably among the most fun, but also kind of scary. It wasn't just former"
58:48;58:54;"family members. It was also cops who were kind of living off the grid and people who were private"
58:54;59:00;"investigators, people who I knew I couldn't call and get to talk to me or talk honestly to me. I"
59:00;59:07;"had to show up. So I mean, a couple of the Manson women who I think really got off easy, that I"
59:07;59:12;"think they were much more involved in the murders and they were accessories. Two or three in"
59:12;59:19;"particular were kind of scary when I showed up at their house. One of them had some scary sons who"
59:19;59:24;"were all tatted up. And I already knew about them because the sons had been in prison and they were"
59:24;59:32;"white supremacy guys and those gangs. And then Steve Grogan, who was the only Manson family"
59:32;59:37;"member to be convicted of a murder who got paroled, Clem or Scramblehead as they called him."
59:37;59:44;"He married his prison psychiatrist, changed his name to hers and had never been found since he"
59:44;59:50;"was released from prison. And I think it was like 79 or 80 until I went to his house and knocked on"
59:50;59:56;"his door. And I mean, he bounded down the stairs and I said, ""Mr."" I can't remember what his fake"
59:56;01:00:01;"name was, his wife's name. He said, ""Yeah, that's me."" I said, ""Well, I'm here to talk to you about"
01:00:01;01:00:06;"your previous wife as Steven Grogan."" And he just went white and he goes, ""I don't know what you're"
01:00:06;01:00:13;"talking about."" And I said, ""Come on, Clem. I know who you are."" He denied that he was Steve Grogan."
01:00:13;01:00:18;"And he was a very important family member. If you saw the Tarantino movie, he was the one that Brad"
01:00:18;01:00:25;"Pitt kicked the out of at Spahn Ranch after he had fled his car or something. He was based on Clem."
01:00:26;01:00:32;"I started pulling out my documents because I got court records and birth dates. And he kind of told"
01:00:32;01:00:36;"me to leave the property or he was going to call the police. And I said, ""But the police have,"
01:00:36;01:00:40;"I don't think they're going to be too aggressive with me, but I don't want you to do that. So I'll"
01:00:40;01:00:45;"leave, but I'm coming back tomorrow to see if you change your mind. So I'll come back around this"
01:00:45;01:00:51;"time."" And I said, ""Here's my number. Here's a hotel I'm staying in. If you can call me."" And"
01:00:51;01:00:57;"I mean, two hours later, I got a cease and desist letter from his attorney. And I went back the next"
01:00:57;01:01:02;"day and he wouldn't talk to me. So yeah, there were a lot of people like him that I think are"
01:01:02;01:01:07;"what I call the secret keepers, Linda Kasabian, other family members who I think know the truth"
01:01:07;01:01:15;"of this, but they'll never tell it because it's going to implicate them in crimes that have no"
01:01:15;01:01:19;"statute of limitations, which is one crime, murder. - Right. That's incredible."
01:01:19;01:01:36;"(soft music)"
01:01:36;01:01:40;"So Tom, you alluded to the fact that you're probably going to do another book. Do you have"
01:01:40;01:01:45;"a sense of what else comes next? In the book you talked about, you'd had offers maybe to"
01:01:45;01:01:53;"do some type of TV series, which you'd passed up. - Yeah. The filmmaker, Earl Morris, wanted to do"
01:01:53;01:01:58;"a documentary on the book and a little bit about it's in the book, but I don't think I named him."
01:01:58;01:02:04;"He shot a, what do they call it? A teaser. He spent like two or three days filming me at my"
01:02:04;01:02:10;"house with a big crew and sold it to Netflix. And then long story short, he and I had a falling out"
01:02:10;01:02:15;"kind of creative differences and he ended up doing Wormwood. I don't know if you guys saw that."
01:02:15;01:02:22;"It was on Netflix. - Right. Which is similar subject matter or related. - Yeah. It evolved"
01:02:22;01:02:27;"out of the project he and I were doing. He actually, I was talking a lot about the Frank Olson"
01:02:27;01:02:31;"death and Eric Olson, the son. And he asked me to put them in touch with Eric to see if he could get"
01:02:31;01:02:36;"Eric to talk a little about it in the film he was doing on me. And then all of a sudden he wanted"
01:02:36;01:02:41;"to do both our stories together. And I just, my book wasn't published then. I was still getting"
01:02:41;01:02:46;"sued. I didn't know if I was going to be able to resell it. And I said, ""Earl, I'm not going to,"
01:02:46;01:02:51;"as much as I love Eric and it's a great story, I don't want to share my information with another"
01:02:51;01:02:57;"story because I need to be the dedicated subject. So do Eric and I'm going to walk away."" And that's"
01:02:57;01:03:03;"what I did. But there is a deal that Amazon optioned the book and there's a screenwriter who"
01:03:04;01:03:08;"has just finished the script. And I heard last week, they're sending it out to directors"
01:03:08;01:03:14;"and it's going to be for better or worse, I'm the protagonist in this thing. So it's going to be"
01:03:14;01:03:21;"about me chasing the story. But I'm just a little worried because once Hollywood gets their hands"
01:03:21;01:03:27;"on something like this, then they start to change things. And I'm dreading reading the script when"
01:03:27;01:03:32;"I finally get it, but I hope it gets made because I'm still- - Yeah, we got to get Fincher on it."
01:03:32;01:03:38;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, who knows? But it'll help me because I'm still really in debt from"
01:03:38;01:03:46;"all the lawsuits. - Oh my God, that's amazing, man. What a journey. Well, I guess just the last thing,"
01:03:46;01:03:52;"and thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us. We've referenced a lot and we've"
01:03:52;01:03:55;"talked about it in previous episodes, but in our conversation with you, we've talked a lot about"
01:03:55;01:04:00;"MKUltra and you talked about your interest in Frank Olson. And we don't want to give away too"
01:04:00;01:04:04;"much because we really recommend people read the book and experience this information that way."
01:04:04;01:04:09;"But in the course of your research, you became very familiar with this idea or with this project,"
01:04:09;01:04:15;"MKUltra. And I've just noticed more and more people referencing it. You see more and more"
01:04:15;01:04:20;"people using the phrase ""PSYOP"" all the time these days, which it's funny. Actually, I learned this"
01:04:20;01:04:25;"from your book. You talk about the fact that brainwash, that phrase didn't exist in the"
01:04:25;01:04:31;"English language until the Korean War. And you say that it actually comes from a Chinese phrase."
01:04:31;01:04:36;"- Yeah. Well, they were the first ones that were actually experimenting with it during the Korean"
01:04:36;01:04:42;"War and previously. And they invented, I don't know if they invented the word for it or I don't"
01:04:42;01:04:48;"know enough about Chinese language, but yeah, it came from them. - So basically, there's one part"
01:04:48;01:04:56;"of the book that we don't have to go too into detail about, but it's the story of Jimmy Shaver."
01:04:56;01:05:00;"- Yeah. - Can you just summarize what MKUltra was and maybe tell like the real quick version"
01:05:00;01:05:07;"of the Jimmy Shaver story? - Yeah. Well, the ultimate objective of MKUltra was to create"
01:05:07;01:05:13;"programmed assassins, people who could be either using drugs or hypnotism, sensory deprivation,"
01:05:13;01:05:17;"whatever. The CIA was trying to figure out how they could take control of people's minds and"
01:05:17;01:05:23;"get them to do acts that were against their moral code, including all kinds of things,"
01:05:23;01:05:30;"but most importantly, to kill somebody without any recollection of being programmed to do it."
01:05:30;01:05:35;"And oftentimes they hoped that they could create it so that they wouldn't remember having done it"
01:05:35;01:05:41;"after they'd done it. And there was a famous book from the late 50s called ""The Manchurian"
01:05:41;01:05:46;"Candidate,"" which later became a movie in the early 60s and then was remade, I think like 10"
01:05:46;01:05:51;"years ago, which is based on, I mean, that guy that I can't, what's the name of the guy, I forget"
01:05:51;01:05:55;"the name of the author who wrote the first book, but I'm convinced and a lot of people are convinced"
01:05:55;01:05:59;"he was actually part of the program and it was kind of, he was putting out a little information"
01:05:59;01:06:06;"there. I don't think with the agency's knowledge. So Jimmy Shaver was convicted of killing a three"
01:06:06;01:06:13;"year old girl, two and a half year old girl named Sherry Horton. And he was found in a gravel pit"
01:06:13;01:06:21;"in Texas in 1953, wandering around dazed with, his shirt was off and there were scratches on him."
01:06:21;01:06:25;"This little girl had been missing for about three or four hours. There had been a search party."
01:06:25;01:06:32;"He was taken into custody and they found the little girl's body and he admitted that he"
01:06:32;01:06:36;"probably killed her, but he had no recollection of doing it. He didn't know how he got to where he"
01:06:36;01:06:42;"was. It was a sensational story in the state of Texas. It didn't really have national coverage,"
01:06:42;01:06:49;"but what I found out was that Jimmy Shaver was, well, he was an airman at Lackland Air Force Base"
01:06:49;01:06:57;"in 1953 and 54 when this happened. And Jolly West, who was a central figure in my book,"
01:06:57;01:07:05;"was the psychiatrist who examined him for the trial and extracted a confession from him and"
01:07:05;01:07:12;"was able to make him remember killing this little girl. I present a case in my book"
01:07:12;01:07:18;"that this was all part of the experiments Jolly West was conducting at Lackland Air Force Base"
01:07:18;01:07:24;"at the time to try to get people to go and commit acts against their moral codes. I don't think he"
01:07:24;01:07:30;"had ever wanted to program Shaver to commit this murder. I think it was something that went wrong,"
01:07:30;01:07:36;"but I had found letters and it's a big section of, I think, chapter 11 of the book showing that this"
01:07:36;01:07:44;"Jolly West had been a part of the MKUltra program starting in 1952, 53, was at Lackland Air Force"
01:07:44;01:07:49;"Base experimenting on airmen to achieve just this kind of thing, the erasure of memory,"
01:07:49;01:07:55;"the implantation of false memories. And I think that Jimmy Shaver was an MKUltra"
01:07:55;01:08:00;"experiment gone very wrong. And I think if your listeners read the book, they'll get a clear"
01:08:00;01:08:05;"picture of what I'm trying to say here because it's hard. But yesterday I did a podcast with"
01:08:05;01:08:12;"the niece of a little girl who was killed. So Sherry Jo, yeah, so Sherry Jo was turning three"
01:08:12;01:08:20;"when she was murdered in 1954. And her older brother was with her when she was abducted."
01:08:20;01:08:26;"And he was about seven. He died a few years ago, but his daughter and her husband have a podcast."
01:08:26;01:08:32;"And they reached out to me and said, we want you to come on our podcast and talk about"
01:08:32;01:08:37;"the death of my aunt, Sherry. It's actually how they pronounce it. I didn't know that."
01:08:37;01:08:43;"And I was a little worried about it because it's such a sensitive subject and it impacted their"
01:08:43;01:08:49;"lives. But they're convinced that the evidence I present shows that everything they thought"
01:08:49;01:08:56;"about the death of this little girl for her family for 60, 70 years was wrong and was part of a"
01:08:56;01:09:01;"cover-up by the government. And they want to pursue it now. And that's gratifying to me in the end."
01:09:02;01:09:06;"And I was actually happy to honor the girl's memory by talking to her family. So it went"
01:09:06;01:09:12;"pretty well. I think it's going to go up in a few days, but that's an important story."
01:09:12;01:09:17;"I think in my book, I don't get asked about it a lot. It's a horrible story. I mean, in the end,"
01:09:17;01:09:22;"it's difficult to read when you see what happened to her, but it's fascinating. And I think really"
01:09:22;01:09:28;"kind of important in the timeline of the evolution of MKUltra and what they were doing."
01:09:28;01:09:31;"Right. Well, thanks so much, Thomas. It's been great talking to you."
01:09:31;01:09:32;"Yeah, thanks for having me."
01:09:32;01:09:35;"I encourage everybody to read Chaos, book of the year."
01:09:35;01:09:38;"Thank you. Thank you."
01:09:38;01:09:39;"Have a good one, man."
01:09:39;01:09:42;"All right, guys. I enjoyed it. All right. Bye-bye."
01:09:42;01:09:42;"Bye."
01:09:42;01:10:11;"Looking through a telescope At a letter in an envelope I can't make out what she wrote I guess I will never know Like a precious stone, I'm swimming in a pond Eyes on the
ground, I'm drowning in a pond"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"Time crisis"
01:10:13;01:10:18;"Well, Tom O'Neill, what a legend. I like that he's just such a nice guy, too."
01:10:18;01:10:24;"I'm also glad to hear that there's a script being worked on where he's the protagonist."
01:10:24;01:10:24;"Yeah."
01:10:24;01:10:29;"I think for both of us, that was a really appealing side of it. In fact, when you first told me about"
01:10:29;01:10:35;"it, I think you specifically said, ""He's this dude. He's taking these random old cops to Denny's to"
01:10:35;01:10:40;"try to get information about them."" And there's a part of that that's just as appealing as what"
01:10:40;01:10:45;"he uncovers about the deception and the connections between local law enforcement and the CIA and"
01:10:45;01:10:51;"Charles Manson. That stuff's cool, very fascinating. But also just like he's the perfect person to take"
01:10:51;01:10:52;"you on this journey."
01:10:52;01:10:59;"Oh, absolutely. And of course, I feel like we got fresh research done on this interview."
01:10:59;01:11:06;"David Fincher's parents were friends with Charles Manson's parole officer. That is a big get."
01:11:06;01:11:09;"Yeah, I'm going to do some original research because that's pretty wild because I didn't"
01:11:09;01:11:14;"want to bore him with too much Zodiac stuff. But this morning when I knew we were having him on"
01:11:14;01:11:19;"the show, I actually sat down with a pad and paper. I wrote a little timeline out just so I'd"
01:11:19;01:11:26;"know what I was talking about. That's where I was like, ""August 1st, 1969, Zodiac Killer sent..."""
01:11:26;01:11:31;"Because basically, in that time period, the Zodiac Killer sends his letter to the San Francisco"
01:11:31;01:11:36;"Chronicle. They publish his cipher. A week later, the Manson murders happen. A week after that,"
01:11:36;01:11:43;"the Zodiac Killer strikes again in the city of San Francisco. Then he kills again in September"
01:11:43;01:11:49;"and October. They finally get Charles Manson in December 1969. Just imagine that whole time"
01:11:49;01:11:54;"period after the Tate murders. There are these murders going on up north by the Zodiac Killer."
01:11:54;01:11:58;"All this stuff happening together is crazy. And we talked about when Death Spot was on the show,"
01:11:58;01:12:04;"and I was actually texting Alec because he talked about this, that there's always been a theory that"
01:12:04;01:12:11;"Ted Kaczynski could have been the Zodiac Killer. I don't know if that's true, but one thing is true"
01:12:11;01:12:16;"is that a lot of people think that Ted Kaczynski was at least partially a product of MKUltra."
01:12:16;01:12:16;"Oh, sure."
01:12:16;01:12:21;"I don't know if there's hard documentation that he was part of MKUltra. He definitely was part"
01:12:21;01:12:26;"of psychological experiments when he was an undergrad at Harvard that some people thought"
01:12:26;01:12:34;"went too far. That's for sure. Whether there was a CIA link to those projects or those experiments,"
01:12:34;01:12:40;"who's to say? But it is weird as hell just to imagine that in the summer of '69, which was a"
01:12:40;01:12:46;"very positive summer for Bryan Adams, but not for many people. In the summer of '69, you had the"
01:12:46;01:12:53;"Manson murders, the Zodiac Killer, and Ted Kaczynski being a professor at Berkeley all there."
01:12:53;01:12:58;"CIA has a secret office in San Francisco, so does the FBI. Got the Black Panthers,"
01:12:58;01:13:04;"Ronald Reagan, California summer of '69. That is some crazy [beep]"
01:13:04;01:13:11;"Hetty Brew. I think we should do a rewrite of summer of '69."
01:13:11;01:13:17;"I worked for MKUltra. I dosed Charles Manson."
01:13:17;01:13:25;"Just a song that has the same vibe as the film Zodiac or Tom's book."
01:13:25;01:13:28;"Wait, what if we take 20 years to write the song?"
01:13:30;01:13:37;"It's like, we both had music projects. JK Moundries, I had Vampire Weekend. We started"
01:13:37;01:13:41;"the song as a lark. We figured we could probably get it done in a couple of weeks,"
01:13:41;01:13:44;"maybe play it on the show. Next thing you know, we actually stopped doing the show."
01:13:44;01:13:50;"Research for the song became a passion of ours, and it took us 20 years. We're both deeply in"
01:13:50;01:13:57;"debt, but now it's 2040, and we'd like to present to you our... The song is four hours long,"
01:13:59;01:14:00;"and it's called Summer of '69."
01:14:00;01:14:03;"Crickets."
01:14:03;01:14:07;"Also, just the last thing I'll say, there's a line somewhere in Dark Star,"
01:14:07;01:14:15;"that Jerry Garcia book I keep referencing, where somebody's talking about how many great musicians"
01:14:15;01:14:22;"just happened to be growing up in the Bay Area, Palo Alto area, SF area in that time."
01:14:22;01:14:26;"Obviously, a lot of people moved to SF once it became known as the hippie town."
01:14:26;01:14:26;"Sure."
01:14:26;01:14:30;"But even before then, a lot of people just happened to be there. There's a quote from"
01:14:30;01:14:36;"somebody who's like, ""Oh, and by the way, Robert Hunter, he did acid experiments. He was part of"
01:14:36;01:14:41;"MKUltra."" So there is something crazy to imagine that weirdly there are connections between the"
01:14:41;01:14:48;"CIA, the Grateful Dead, Charles Manson, Ted Kaczynski, the JFK assassination, all this sh*t."
01:14:48;01:14:52;"But there's a line somewhere in Dark Star where somebody says something about the fact that all"
01:14:52;01:14:57;"these interesting people came together who created cultural products that changed the world, or at"
01:14:57;01:15:00;"least changed America. And somebody says, ""I don't know, man. There must have just been"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"something in the air."""
01:15:02;01:15:04;"Something in the water."
01:15:04;01:15:08;"Something in the water. And somebody even says, ""Well, you know, Stanford Research Institute was"
01:15:08;01:15:12;"around there."" And that's this famous research institute that worked on everything from, I think,"
01:15:12;01:15:19;"like atomic bombs to marketing. But a lot of secretive sh*t was happening there. And somebody"
01:15:19;01:15:23;"says, ""I don't know, man."" They made some joke about maybe Stanford Research Institute was"
01:15:23;01:15:28;"pumping some chemicals up into the air out there in Palo Alto because there was something happening"
01:15:28;01:15:33;"there, man, in the '60s and that era. And it really made me think, ""I don't know. Maybe there"
01:15:33;01:15:42;"was."" Wouldn't that be crazy if there's some weird byproduct of CIA experiments made everybody in the"
01:15:42;01:15:48;"peninsula lightly dosed? Like a young Steve Jobs, Robert Hunter, Jerry Garcia."
01:15:48;01:15:56;"There is something about the Bay Area being the center of culture, tech, and apparently"
01:15:56;01:16:00;"secret intelligence operations. Talk about a heady brew."
01:16:00;01:16:06;"You know what's crazy thing about, just by chance, if Jerry Garcia, Charles Manson, and Steve Jobs"
01:16:06;01:16:13;"were all sitting in the same Indian restaurant in The Hate in 1968, and they obviously didn't"
01:16:13;01:16:16;"know who each other were. Or Manson probably knew who Garcia was."
01:16:16;01:16:18;"But like-- - No, first of all, I don't know how--"
01:16:18;01:16:23;"Steve Jobs, he would have been like a teenager or something. Garcia and Manson, there's no way"
01:16:23;01:16:28;"those dudes did not walk past each other on the street at least once. Hate Esprit is not a big"
01:16:28;01:16:28;"neighborhood. - No."
01:16:28;01:16:33;"- The central area, there's no way that Manson and Garcia probably weren't even at the same party at"
01:16:33;01:16:37;"some point. That absolutely happened. - They were probably shopping in The"
01:16:37;01:16:41;"Gap at the same time, right? - I think The Gap opened August '69."
01:16:41;01:16:42;"How crazy is that? - Are you serious?"
01:16:42;01:16:43;"Because I was joking. - In SF."
01:16:43;01:16:46;"- Definitely not in The Hate. I was just joking about like--"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"- I know it's 1969. What months did The Gap open?"
01:16:48;01:16:56;"- Now, now, now, now, now, now, let's get a number crunch. Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000."
01:16:56;01:17:01;"- The Gap opened its first store August 21st, 1969."
01:17:01;01:17:04;"- Oh my god. - Whoa."
01:17:04;01:17:10;"Ezra, if we had a time machine, I swear to god, you and I, like Bill and Ted style, we would have"
01:17:10;01:17:18;"to go back to San Francisco on August 1st, 1969. - Well, we want to go earlier. We want to go like"
01:17:18;01:17:19;"'68. - Yeah, '68."
01:17:19;01:17:21;"- We don't want to rip down to LA maybe. - Yes."
01:17:21;01:17:25;"- That's actually an interesting question. You're not talking about like going back like"
01:17:25;01:17:31;"thousands of years, but you know, people always talk about like, would you stop Hitler? Well,"
01:17:31;01:17:34;"you know, Hitler and the wars he caused that killed millions and millions of people."
01:17:34;01:17:38;"Most people would say, well, that's a lot of lives to save. But then you get into some weird"
01:17:38;01:17:43;"(beep) like, what if you could go back in time and stop the Manson murders? Like morally, you'd"
01:17:43;01:17:47;"save the lives of four people, a pregnant woman, you know, of course, but then you really do get"
01:17:47;01:17:52;"in some weird butterfly effect (beep). You know what, I would do it. Even if that meant that like,"
01:17:52;01:17:57;"all you guys had never been born, I'd really hate to see you go, but I would go back in time."
01:17:57;01:18:01;"Then I'd come back. I'd be so curious to see how different the world might be"
01:18:01;01:18:06;"if the Manson murders never happened. That'd be crazy. It would definitely suck if I'm like,"
01:18:06;01:18:10;"yo Jake, I just got back. And it's like, this number doesn't exist. I'm like, what the (beep)"
01:18:10;01:18:14;"and I'm like looking up the long stretch, like somehow you didn't get born because I stopped the"
01:18:14;01:18:18;"Manson murders. That's a Twilight Zone episode. - Dude."
01:18:18;01:18:21;"- That's a black mirror. - I like this idea of us doing like a Bill"
01:18:21;01:18:26;"and Ted. Like we could go back to '68 and find Manson in the heat and just follow him"
01:18:26;01:18:34;"and see if he like met Jolly West. See if like, just like be a fly in the wall and just track."
01:18:34;01:18:39;"- Oh yo, that's good. Or we're just like, if we don't change history, we lay real low,"
01:18:39;01:18:43;"but we have like one iPhone with us and we're just like filming all this (beep)"
01:18:43;01:18:47;"Oh, and like, maybe like the charger breaks at some point and we have to go find like young"
01:18:47;01:18:52;"Steve Jobs and we're like, bro, can you figure out? And he's like, what the (beep) is this (beep)"
01:18:52;01:18:58;"We have like one iPhone with us and we go down and we're like filming it and we kind of film"
01:18:58;01:19:02;"all of it. And we're just like, got it. And then we come back in time and we show people"
01:19:02;01:19:07;"all this footage and we're just like pariahs. People were like, you filmed the murders and"
01:19:07;01:19:11;"you didn't stop it. We're like, well, if we stopped it, all this crazy (beep) like we all"
01:19:11;01:19:15;"might, you might not even be alive. People are like, you guys are despicable. And we're like,"
01:19:15;01:19:20;"call Tom and they were like, Tom, we got the footage, man. Yeah. The CIA does Manson."
01:19:20;01:19:27;"We figured it out. And everybody just (beep) hates us. It's kind of lose, lose in a sense,"
01:19:27;01:19:32;"but I like, I don't want to film the murders. I want to just go to a year before the murders"
01:19:32;01:19:38;"and follow Manson for like a week. Yeah. Like we follow his parole officer and we go to,"
01:19:38;01:19:41;"we kind of, yeah, solve some of this (beep) Yeah. If we stopped the murders."
01:19:41;01:19:44;"And then also catch a dead show while we're that, you know, back there."
01:19:44;01:19:48;"We see the dead at the film art."
01:19:49;01:20:07;"Easy win, going across the bayou today. There's a whole lot of women,"
01:20:09;01:20:14;"are out dressed in red on the streets today."
01:20:14;01:20:33;"Well, it was a very heady time, San Francisco in the late sixties, but there's another town"
01:20:33;01:20:40;"in America. That's also full of mystery, a place that's just teeming with conspiracy theories."
01:20:40;01:20:46;"And that's Hershey, Pennsylvania. We haven't talked about it in a minute, but similar to Tom"
01:20:46;01:20:53;"O'Neill and his dogged research, we doggedly pursued this story about whether or not Hershey's"
01:20:53;01:21:01;"changes the formula for Reese's peanut butter cups between the winter and the summer. We've"
01:21:01;01:21:05;"gotten a lot of people writing in, we've got some interesting leads. We've had some, you know,"
01:21:05;01:21:10;"heartbreaking failures as we've tried to crack the case. But finally we have somebody directly"
01:21:10;01:21:16;"from the Hershey company, their director of social strategy and content and the creator of C-Suite,"
01:21:16;01:21:20;"Hershey's in-house agency, Ryan Reese. So maybe we can finally get some answers."
01:21:28;01:21:34;"Hello. Is that Ryan? Yeah. How are you guys? Oh, not bad. Thanks for calling. Where are we"
01:21:34;01:21:39;"talking to you from? Is it Hershey PA? Hershey PA, sweetest place on earth. Okay. That rules."
01:21:39;01:21:44;"I wondered if you'd be like, you could kind of picture sometimes with these big companies,"
01:21:44;01:21:50;"they might spin off their agency somewhere else. You're just like, I'm in downtown Chicago right"
01:21:50;01:21:58;"now. I'm talking to you from the 80th floor of a... Okay. So you're in Hershey PA. That's where"
01:21:58;01:22:04;"your office is. Are you from Pennsylvania? No, I grew up in Florida. Basically after I got my MBA,"
01:22:04;01:22:10;"I came to Hershey because of the Hershey company. Like it wasn't like I had any like"
01:22:10;01:22:16;"friends, relatives, anyone. So when my wife and I moved here, I got married a week before my"
01:22:16;01:22:22;"internship. And like when I picked my wife up from like the airport, cause you know, I started"
01:22:22;01:22:28;"like two weeks after the honeymoon, you know, she on the way just started crying and was like,"
01:22:28;01:22:33;"I don't know anyone here. I hate everything here. And I was like, well, you've actually never been"
01:22:33;01:22:37;"here. So it makes sense that you don't have any friends here and that you don't know anyone."
01:22:37;01:22:44;"But now, you know, we've kind of fallen into the two kids living the dream with no traffic"
01:22:44;01:22:49;"lifestyle. That is Hershey, Pennsylvania. So what's the town of Hershey like? Are there"
01:22:49;01:22:55;"any unusual things about it? Or obviously there's a big chocolate factory, huh?"
01:22:55;01:23:00;"It's one of those things that I don't think my kids will ever realize necessarily that it's not"
01:23:00;01:23:05;"normal. You know what I'm saying? Cause this is their normal. But like, like when you're driving"
01:23:05;01:23:13;"in downtown Hershey, which, you know, is like a block and a half, you know, in a one story building,"
01:23:13;01:23:19;"the streetlights are Hershey kisses. And then, you know, you're driving by and you know, you have a"
01:23:19;01:23:25;"big chocolate factory and it'll smell like chocolate or smell like Reese's. It smells"
01:23:25;01:23:30;"more to me like Reese's when they're roasting the peanuts. And it's like, these things are not like"
01:23:30;01:23:35;"normal, but like, if you only have grown up there, you think it's kind of normal. And then there's"
01:23:35;01:23:42;"the giant Hershey park, right? Which is like big park. Yeah. It's a big amusement park. So we would"
01:23:42;01:23:47;"have season passes and you know, if you have a season pass, like after work, Hey kids, do you"
01:23:47;01:23:52;"want to go to Hershey park? You know, it's like, yeah, let's just go for a couple hours. Right."
01:23:52;01:23:57;"So they grew up like going to like Hershey park and like smelling roasted peanuts, driving on"
01:23:57;01:24:02;"street with Hershey kiss lights. And then to them, that's like nothing, right? This is like,"
01:24:02;01:24:05;"yeah, yeah. That's totally normal. So I guess one of my first questions is,"
01:24:05;01:24:10;"so you're talking about the smell when they're roasting the peanuts. Does that vary when they"
01:24:10;01:24:16;"switch to the winter formula from the summer formula? Oh God. I heard, I, okay. This, yeah,"
01:24:16;01:24:21;"this is like, I was just waiting for this. I was like, what? I wanted to know the theory behind"
01:24:21;01:24:27;"this. Cause you guys all seem like bright guys. You know, I read, you know, a couple of like your"
01:24:27;01:24:35;"CVs. I actually am curious as to the Genesis, the Epic of Gilgamesh part of the story of how this"
01:24:35;01:24:40;"came about, this theory. So you read our CVs. We know a little bit about you. You said you have an"
01:24:40;01:24:45;"MBA, but you're the director of social strategy and content at Hershey. So you're, you're kind of"
01:24:45;01:24:50;"like a spokesperson. You're all about projecting the image of the brand, right? That's your job."
01:24:50;01:24:55;"Definitely not. No, that is definitely not my job. What I do is, well, I guess, I don't know."
01:24:55;01:24:59;"It depends on how you're defining it, but like, yeah, I'm in charge of the creative,"
01:24:59;01:25:03;"right? So in terms of a lot of advertising, yeah. So all the posts that you'll see,"
01:25:03;01:25:07;"like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest for the majority of the brands, like,"
01:25:08;01:25:14;"C-Suite Studio is our internal agency. And that's kind of the, you know, we started that about two"
01:25:14;01:25:20;"years ago, you know, because obviously the need for content is higher than it's ever been. And so,"
01:25:20;01:25:24;"yeah, that's kind of what my team does. I respect all that, but I just want to"
01:25:24;01:25:29;"understand something on a day to day, in terms of operations, how often are you interacting"
01:25:29;01:25:36;"with the chemists who are specifically work on Reese's? Not often, but okay."
01:25:36;01:25:42;"Throughout my 11 years, I have worked with them on various occasions, tested it, right."
01:25:42;01:25:48;"Tasted it right from the line, tasted it, you know, in a jar. I once asked them just on the"
01:25:48;01:25:53;"side to make me a jar of it just because it's like just the center of the cup, just like that."
01:25:53;01:25:57;"And they did it. It was great. What time of year was that?"
01:26:02;01:26:06;"All right. You gave us some background. So I'll give you some background on Jake. You said you"
01:26:06;01:26:12;"checked out our CVs. I believe Jake and I both have BAs. Jake, you have an advanced degree."
01:26:12;01:26:13;"Yeah, I do. I have an MFA."
01:26:13;01:26:14;"Yeah."
01:26:14;01:26:16;"I have a very strong CV."
01:26:16;01:26:19;"Oh, no, I was thoroughly impressed."
01:26:19;01:26:24;"So the way that we first got, you know, we got tipped off on this from a friend of mine I grew"
01:26:24;01:26:30;"up with. And basically he used to work at a bike shop in Brooklyn and he would run errands for his"
01:26:30;01:26:37;"boss. And his boss was a lover, like many of us, of Reese's peanut butter cups. And he'd often send"
01:26:37;01:26:42;"them to the corner store to go grab one. And he would give it to his boss. And sometimes the boss"
01:26:42;01:26:45;"would eat one and say, you know, you can have the rest. And it would always confuse my friend. He'd"
01:26:45;01:26:51;"say, well, why? You're such a Reese's nut. And he'd say, because that one's the winter formula."
01:26:51;01:26:56;"I only like the summer formula. And this guy had a very advanced palate. He's a successful"
01:26:56;01:27:02;"businessman. He owned a bike shop in Brooklyn. So it's fair to say that this guy knew what was up."
01:27:02;01:27:07;"And he had a very advanced palate. He could tell when it was one or the other. And sometimes he'd"
01:27:07;01:27:12;"get and say, that's great. And we got some emails from other people who said, yes, this is true."
01:27:12;01:27:14;"People also with advanced palates."
01:27:14;01:27:15;"Yeah."
01:27:15;01:27:20;"And we look, we've had internal debate on the show about whether or not it's true. We had somebody"
01:27:21;01:27:26;"who noticed like the number of grams of potassium was different between different"
01:27:26;01:27:32;"Reese's that they'd collected over the years. I don't know if that's part of it, but"
01:27:32;01:27:35;"yeah, we've just been trying to get some verification."
01:27:35;01:27:39;"Yeah. You're looking for answers. No, I can respect that. I mean,"
01:27:39;01:27:40;"Thank you."
01:27:40;01:27:44;"This is kind of an investigative report. And I appreciate that. That shows the passion and love"
01:27:44;01:27:48;"for our brand. And I, you know, nothing but respect from my side."
01:27:48;01:27:49;"Thank you."
01:27:49;01:27:51;"The winter formula."
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Okay."
01:27:52;01:27:57;"Just to get down to it. It's quite similar to the summer formula. Some would even say it"
01:27:57;01:28:03;"is the exact summer formula. Some, you know, I happen to be one of that some"
01:28:03;01:28:09;"that say it's the exact same formula, but I'm wondering, I'm just saying it could be, you know,"
01:28:09;01:28:15;"a lot of different factors, you know, but there's different ratios of peanut butter."
01:28:15;01:28:18;"Was he always getting the same one? Because there's different ratios of peanut butter,"
01:28:18;01:28:22;"which obviously provide a different experience, you know,"
01:28:22;01:28:22;"Wait, what do you mean?"
01:28:22;01:28:25;"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,"
01:28:25;01:28:26;"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,"
01:28:26;01:28:27;"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,"
01:28:27;01:28:27;"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"That's where I thought this was going, you know,"
01:28:29;01:28:32;"Wait, there's different ratios of peanut butter in the summer and the winter?"
01:28:32;01:28:39;"No, not, no, not true, but there are different ratios across the product line."
01:28:39;01:28:45;"You know, like when you think about the various sizes, I looked at your CVs, I looked at my own,"
01:28:45;01:28:50;"I don't think any of us have advanced degrees in physics, but I think we can kind of understand"
01:28:50;01:28:56;"that to get the shape of the peanut butter cup, you know, some of the small ones are, you know,"
01:28:56;01:28:57;"Oh yeah, of course."
01:28:57;01:28:58;"Vertically oriented."
01:28:58;01:29:01;"Different amount of surface area. Yeah, yeah, sure."
01:29:01;01:29:05;"Yeah. So, you know, some of those will have less peanut butter to chocolate."
01:29:05;01:29:09;"Let's make it more general. Is it unprecedented in the history of the company?"
01:29:09;01:29:16;"Or in the sweets industry to obviously summer is the enemy of chocolate to some extent, right?"
01:29:16;01:29:21;"S'mores. I mean, people, it's a nice s'mores. It can kind of help the melting process already."
01:29:21;01:29:22;"He's dodging."
01:29:22;01:29:29;"I mean, it's, you know, no, these are tough questions. I was told this was a,"
01:29:29;01:29:33;"you know, a great group of guys had some, you know, pretty softball questions."
01:29:33;01:29:35;"I didn't realize this was, this was going to be so intense."
01:29:35;01:29:36;"No, this is hard hitting."
01:29:36;01:29:38;"Yeah, no."
01:29:38;01:29:42;"Well, you gotta, you gotta understand that the guest we had on before you was this guy,"
01:29:42;01:29:47;"Tom O'Neill, who wrote this great book. He spent 20 years investigating the Manson murders and"
01:29:47;01:29:50;"he uncovered all sorts of stuff that nobody had before."
01:29:50;01:29:50;"Yeah."
01:29:50;01:29:52;"So we're a little bit fired up after that, but."
01:29:52;01:29:53;"Yeah."
01:29:53;01:29:56;"So the official line is that the formula stays the same."
01:29:56;01:29:58;"That is correct. The formula does stay the same."
01:29:58;01:30:03;"G's up, rev them V's up, federally trying to reach us to keep us"
01:30:03;01:30:07;"flooded pieces, diamond sized pieces, pieces. You know who he is,"
01:30:07;01:30:12;"looking talk show like Regis, King Push flow prestigious, hustle with me like leeches."
01:30:12;01:30:15;"X and O's, tic-tac-toe, up 'em, duck 'em, let them go."
01:30:15;01:30:19;"On to the next, knock us in the decks of them Cali Lolos. Houston,"
01:30:19;01:30:23;"Candy Paints, screwed up vocals, New York, Range Road, sit on momos."
01:30:23;01:30:28;"Future in that Bentley, GT, oh no. Float chameleon, worth by the million."
01:30:28;01:30:32;"Sell Bolivian, feds in oblivion. Zooty, zillion, purse reptilian."
01:30:32;01:30:34;"Took 'em from off, off island like Dillard."
01:30:34;01:30:38;"I want to ask you a Tom O'Neill style question. Okay. So maybe we're wrong about it."
01:30:38;01:30:46;"Can you tell us anything that people don't know about Reese's Peanut Butter Cups?"
01:30:46;01:30:49;"Anything that you think has been left out of the official narrative?"
01:30:49;01:30:52;"It could be off the record."
01:30:52;01:30:58;"It could be off the record. No, sorry. Actually, it can't be. It just, that's not the nature."
01:30:58;01:31:10;"I think it's all very much on the up and up, but I do think on a serious note that"
01:31:10;01:31:18;"it's one of those things that because people love it so much and right. And there's like so many"
01:31:18;01:31:23;"different forms and there's so many different ways that you're getting it like from the plant"
01:31:23;01:31:30;"through the system to the retailer. There's like, it's changing hand that I'm sure there is"
01:31:30;01:31:35;"absolutely different tastes when you will get it. Right. You know, like if it was like,"
01:31:35;01:31:40;"sometimes if you cycle through heat, you know, then it's not good. Right. You don't want to like,"
01:31:40;01:31:46;"if the store decides that like, Hey, our bills are too much and we're going to turn off the air"
01:31:46;01:31:51;"conditioning in the summer and it gets cold and then add, you know, that's not really right because"
01:31:51;01:31:55;"you know, peanuts and the oils and it's going through the surface. So there, I'm sure there's"
01:31:55;01:32:01;"a lot of variation, like, um, not a lot of variation, but I'm sure there is variation"
01:32:01;01:32:05;"for those people that like love peanut butter cups and eat them all the time, you know?"
01:32:05;01:32:12;"But yeah, that's a skunk Reese's cup. You know, when you leave beer out in the sun, it gets skunked."
01:32:12;01:32:19;"I'm a teetotaler. So not really. I lost 15 years. Yeah, no, I think that was a younger man."
01:32:19;01:32:26;"That was, that is not the new man, but yeah, no, I, I, I think that's a fair point is that"
01:32:26;01:32:32;"at some mom and pop corner store somewhere. Yeah. Maybe it's sweltering New York city summer."
01:32:32;01:32:38;"It turned the AC off at night. By the time you're purchasing that peanut butter cup,"
01:32:38;01:32:44;"it may have melted a little bit, froze back up seven times or something. And it probably tastes"
01:32:44;01:32:49;"weird. So I guess one question I have for you then is working at the company and living in Hershey,"
01:32:49;01:32:55;"PA, is there like a company store or can you like literally roll, roll down to the factory and get"
01:32:55;01:33:01;"one? Like before it even goes in the wrapper. Oh yeah. When I was on the brand team, like I've"
01:33:01;01:33:06;"been on the brand team a couple of times. You always know if someone goes to the factory,"
01:33:06;01:33:11;"any factory, it's like, Oh, bring stuff back. Right. And so Reese's like, it became this cool"
01:33:11;01:33:16;"thing. So Reese's started doing fresh from the factory cops, you know? So like where we just"
01:33:16;01:33:21;"kind of bypass like all the traditional kind of sell direct, even before like selling direct was"
01:33:21;01:33:26;"like the thing, you know, like now obviously a lot of companies like sell direct, but you can"
01:33:26;01:33:31;"get it, you know, and I've had cups like directly, like, I don't know that I'm like a week old,"
01:33:31;01:33:36;"you know, something like that. And you, it's funny because they do. I don't know if it's like"
01:33:36;01:33:42;"psychosomatic, but like the notion of like, I drove to the factory, I smelled the roasted peanuts."
01:33:42;01:33:48;"Now I'm eating it like in my car. I can't even make it back to the office. It is like, it is a"
01:33:48;01:33:55;"special experience. I mean, it's awesome. A fresh cups got to taste different than a week old."
01:33:55;01:34:00;"Essentially. I mean, you guys are obviously aficionados. Like I will get some fresh from"
01:34:00;01:34:07;"the factory, send them your way so that you guys can do your own kind of experimentation as to."
01:34:07;01:34:12;"Oh, so I got a question for you. So we're, this might be like, not the type of thing"
01:34:12;01:34:17;"we're dealing with in the course of your job too often, but just maybe you have a sense of it. So"
01:34:17;01:34:21;"that'd be amazing. Thank you for the offer. If you send us some Reese's fresh from the factory,"
01:34:21;01:34:27;"we're all here in LA by the time it got to us, you know, let's say we get it within 48 hours"
01:34:27;01:34:35;"or something. Let's say I walked to like a seven 11 somewhere in LA and I buy a Reese's peanut"
01:34:35;01:34:42;"butter cup. Do you have a sense of how long it took to get from the factory to me at the seven"
01:34:42;01:34:47;"11? I'm kind of always amazed by how fast it is, but I think with like modern transportation,"
01:34:47;01:34:53;"I mean, it's days and weeks. I mean, it's not like months, right. It's a pretty like fast,"
01:34:53;01:34:59;"like situation, but it would be weeks, um, you know, and the price stays fresh for a very,"
01:34:59;01:35:05;"very long time. So, no, but even then weeks versus two days is dramatic as a dramatic."
01:35:05;01:35:10;"In fact, that's what I'll do when we receive the fresh from the factory ones, I will walk down to"
01:35:10;01:35:16;"a seven 11, grab some and taste it. Maybe it'll be a dramatic difference. And suddenly it'll say,"
01:35:16;01:35:21;"Oh, well, if I tasted these two things back to back, I might think they had different formulas."
01:35:21;01:35:26;"Yeah, no, definitely. The other thing that's funny is like, um, we always like, whenever we're doing"
01:35:26;01:35:31;"new innovation, like, as you can imagine, like, we get to try like everything. It's like, Oh,"
01:35:31;01:35:34;"we're trying this out. Like, do you like this? Oh, we're trying this. Do you like this? Right."
01:35:34;01:35:38;"So like, we try a lot of products before they ever come out. And it's like, Hey, what do you think"
01:35:38;01:35:44;"about this formulation? I'm like a horrible taste tester. Like I have like the worst palate, like I,"
01:35:44;01:35:49;"you know, to the point where it's like, it's ridiculous, but we do have people that are like"
01:35:49;01:35:58;"super tasters. Yeah. And go through the training and then are able to like, you know, basically"
01:35:58;01:36:02;"help the scientists say, Oh, this one's a little bit oaky. Can we take down this note? Oh, can we"
01:36:02;01:36:08;"do that? Whoa. And then like, if there's ever a need to like change a formula or even not even a"
01:36:08;01:36:13;"formula, but even like a supplier, you know, say, Oh, well, we want to start getting this person"
01:36:13;01:36:19;"going out of business. We need to get a new manufacturer for this element of the formula."
01:36:19;01:36:25;"Like, right. They will just test it rigorously. And it's kind of amazing. Like those people exist"
01:36:25;01:36:30;"because I, I'm like the worst. If it was like a job requirement, I would not be a part of it. So"
01:36:30;01:36:35;"you'll find out amongst yourselves, probably some of you will taste the difference. Some of you"
01:36:35;01:36:39;"might not taste any difference at all. Interesting. Well, thanks so much for taking time. I got one"
01:36:39;01:36:45;"more question for you. Of course, like any red blooded American I'm familiar with Hershey's"
01:36:45;01:36:51;"love Hershey's peanut butter cups. And I'm sure. Yeah. Like almond Hershey's kids. I got like"
01:36:51;01:36:57;"everybody got my faves, but also like a lot of people, my memories of like the big products are"
01:36:57;01:37:02;"so rooted in my own childhood. Cause the older you get, it's not that you don't stop eating candy,"
01:37:02;01:37:06;"adults eat candy too, but you just go for the stuff, you know, you're probably not following"
01:37:06;01:37:12;"all the new innovations and stuff. So I'm curious in recent history, what are some of the Hershey"
01:37:12;01:37:18;"companies like greatest hits of like, say the 2010s? Yeah. So I'll give you like, there was"
01:37:18;01:37:24;"two products that I helped develop, which is kind of like, so I have a bias right toward them, but"
01:37:24;01:37:29;"I think they're wonderful. And I, you know, you know, you guys as Reese's lovers, hopefully we'll"
01:37:29;01:37:37;"try them. So the transparency, yeah, it is a little biased, admittedly. Okay. The first one was"
01:37:37;01:37:43;"Reese's pieces cup, which, you know, basically I was on a train coming back from New York. I got a"
01:37:43;01:37:48;"call from one of our vice presidents and sales saying, Hey, we really need a new innovation"
01:37:48;01:37:52;"that kind of close out the year. Like they were worried about making their number for convenience."
01:37:52;01:37:58;"She's like, do you have anything? And I said like, no, but you know, this guy had always done well"
01:37:58;01:38:01;"by me for my career. And, you know, you always want to like take care of those people. So I said,"
01:38:01;01:38:07;"let me just, I go, I'm literally on a train. I can at least give you the amount of time on the train"
01:38:07;01:38:13;"to think about it. So when I was, I launched this product called the Hershey spread a while ago."
01:38:13;01:38:19;"And during that testing, they had once put Reese's pieces in the jar of peanut butter."
01:38:19;01:38:25;"And for whatever reason, just that little bit of texture and the inside of a Reese's pieces"
01:38:25;01:38:30;"is called panichi. It's kind of like a form of like peanut butter. I know it's very classy."
01:38:30;01:38:34;"Is that an Italian word or something that you guys made it up?"
01:38:34;01:38:40;"It's a word. It's a word. I don't know, but it is a word. And it's, it's like a type of"
01:38:40;01:38:41;"peanut buttery."
01:38:41;01:38:46;"Next time you're talking to somebody and you're saying like, well, I like Reese's peanut butter"
01:38:46;01:38:50;"cups because of the combination of the chocolate on the outside and the peanut butter on the inside."
01:38:50;01:38:57;"Would it be appropriate to say, hold on dummy. I think you mean the panichi on the inside."
01:38:57;01:39:00;"The panichi is only on the inside of Reese's pieces."
01:39:00;01:39:04;"Inside the Reese's peanut butter cup is still the peanut butter."
01:39:04;01:39:05;"Oh, it's not the same thing."
01:39:05;01:39:06;"Oh no."
01:39:06;01:39:10;"They're two different things. Two different formulas."
01:39:10;01:39:15;"One's a winter formula and one's a summer formula because obviously like Reese's pieces,"
01:39:15;01:39:19;"those are great for the summer because they don't melt. So I think we, that's when we use the summer"
01:39:19;01:39:25;"formula, obviously. But so yeah, so inside the Reese's cup is like peanut, like the traditional"
01:39:25;01:39:30;"peanut butter, but inside Reese's pieces is this panichi, right. And like the combination of those"
01:39:30;01:39:37;"two different peanut buttery flavors was like amazing. Right. And so I just said, Hey, I don't"
01:39:37;01:39:42;"know why we've never done this. Let's like, what's the most Reese's thing we can do. Let's just put"
01:39:42;01:39:48;"Reese's pieces inside the peanut butter cup. And so I do know some of the scientists at the tech"
01:39:48;01:39:52;"center. And I basically just called them and said, Hey, is this even like possible? And they said,"
01:39:52;01:39:59;"I don't know why it wouldn't be, let me just make some tonight. So basically he just made like 10"
01:39:59;01:40:04;"of them and we tried them the next day and we're like, damn, this is amazing. I mean, like you get"
01:40:04;01:40:09;"that little bit of crunch and then it's like smashed up Reese's pieces inside the peanut"
01:40:09;01:40:15;"butter cup. They're whole pieces. Oh, it's whole pieces. Yeah. Whoa. And it was also like super on"
01:40:15;01:40:19;"brand, right. It was literally like the brand on brand. It was like, what's the most kind of like"
01:40:19;01:40:25;"fun Reese's thing you could do. And you had the, like the equity colors inside the cup."
01:40:25;01:40:30;"You never knew like what colors you were going to get. Like some were broken, some were like"
01:40:30;01:40:37;"totally intact. It was just fun. And so to me, that was one of the ones that I thought was a"
01:40:37;01:40:44;"really, if you're a Reese's lover to get both Reese's pieces and Reese's cups in the same bite"
01:40:44;01:40:50;"was cool. Yeah. That's a good one. The other one was like the next year they, you know, basically"
01:40:50;01:40:55;"we're like, okay, what's a new innovation. And have you guys ever had nutrageous to me? It's like"
01:40:55;01:41:04;"the most underrated bar ever. It's like delicious. It's the solid bar. Yeah. Is it chocolate covered?"
01:41:04;01:41:10;"Yeah. Is it a payday covered in chocolate? Is that a fair? That's a thing. Yeah. But it's,"
01:41:10;01:41:14;"it's different because it's, you know, payday has that thick caramel. This one has more peanut"
01:41:14;01:41:19;"butter. I don't know if I've ever had a softer caramel. It's delicious. It's like, yeah, amazing."
01:41:19;01:41:25;"So we just said, Hey, if people like the pieces cup, let's just replace all the nuts"
01:41:25;01:41:32;"and put Reese's pieces in that. And so we called it the outrageous. Oh, and to me, I mean,"
01:41:32;01:41:38;"it's indulgent, right? I mean, it's like, you got chocolate, caramel, the pieces,"
01:41:39;01:41:46;"it's a pretty delicious eat."
01:41:47;01:41:50;"Slender on wrap paper tie"
01:41:50;01:41:58;"lifting up his head. He feels the sunlight in his eyes."
01:41:58;01:42:12;"Grasp the kettle top and shoot the breeze. Please ramble while slopscraper side"
01:42:15;01:42:25;"tossing in his bed. Can I make one comment? I don't think you should ever change the logo of"
01:42:25;01:42:31;"Reese's. It's a great logo. And I feel like legacy brands feel a need to modernize."
01:42:31;01:42:38;"And I respect that. It's still that, that nice kind of wax paper, orange. And I feel like the"
01:42:38;01:42:45;"Hershey's logo also similar, very classy. Don't succumb to that pressure to modernize, please."
01:42:45;01:42:49;"Great. I agree with you. I agree with you. Okay, cool. I agree with you."
01:42:49;01:42:54;"Both on all the front. I mean, you're, we have an expression like us."
01:42:54;01:42:58;"What happens is like brand people see their brand all day, every day,"
01:42:58;01:43:04;"they get bored of it much faster than the consumer. And then you also want to get promoted."
01:43:04;01:43:07;"Right. So it's like, well, what did you do? It's like, I kept everything the same."
01:43:07;01:43:11;"Yeah. It's like kind of a weird way to get promoted. So I think sometimes marketers,"
01:43:11;01:43:16;"whether they want to change like an ad campaign, or they want to change packaging,"
01:43:16;01:43:22;"it's like to put their stamp on it when sometimes the smartest thing is to respect"
01:43:22;01:43:29;"what the tradition is. And I feel like what's happened with Mountain Dew and Taco Bell logos"
01:43:29;01:43:34;"in the last 20 years is an absolute travesty. So that's my two cents."
01:43:34;01:43:35;"Can I ask one question?"
01:43:35;01:43:36;"Yeah."
01:43:37;01:43:46;"If you were in charge of having Reese's do one sort of collaboration with another brand,"
01:43:46;01:43:51;"maybe a clothing brand, what would be the sort of perfect collab?"
01:43:51;01:43:57;"Yeah. So for me, love the question. I also love what you said about the color palette. To me,"
01:43:57;01:44:03;"I think a lot of these collabs go wrong in the sense that they want to like logo slap everything."
01:44:03;01:44:07;"And to me, that's just not very exciting or original. I think with Reese's, you know,"
01:44:07;01:44:13;"when you think about like, when people refer to like, oh, the Oreo colorway,"
01:44:13;01:44:17;"Oreo didn't need to even do anything for it to be like an Oreo colorway. So to me,"
01:44:17;01:44:23;"like when you see orange and yellow together, and you throw in maybe even a little bit of"
01:44:23;01:44:29;"hint of brown, you're thinking Reese's. So to me, besides just like who I want to do the collab with,"
01:44:29;01:44:34;"I'd want it to be like, oh, is that a Reese's collab? Like kind of like that,"
01:44:34;01:44:39;"the subtlety versus the like, oh, let me throw my box logo right next to your logo,"
01:44:39;01:44:44;"you know, with an X and say like, oh, look, we did a collab. I wanted to like have a little bit"
01:44:44;01:44:49;"of that subtlety where you had the colorway. And you're just like, dude, is that a Reese's"
01:44:49;01:44:55;"collab? So I don't know. For me, like I kind of like high and low. So I think it'd be fun to do"
01:44:55;01:45:03;"something with like Gucci or like Louis Vuitton or yard, the one that you can only buy in stores."
01:45:03;01:45:10;"But like, I like high low. So I think that would be like, really rad to have like a Reese's colorway"
01:45:10;01:45:13;"kind of thing is like, oh, that Reese's."
01:45:13;01:45:18;"That's sick. Hey, Ryan, did you work on the Travis Scott Reese's cereal collaboration?"
01:45:18;01:45:18;"Was that?"
01:45:18;01:45:24;"No, like, and I wish I did. So Reese's, that was General Mills did that. And it was funny because"
01:45:24;01:45:30;"like, if you're not like I think someone sent us a box and we have to approve everything and someone"
01:45:30;01:45:36;"sent us something and they're like, hey, like you, like, which is sad, right? Like that I might be"
01:45:36;01:45:40;"the one that might be most knowledgeable of the coolest. But that's like that comes with the"
01:45:40;01:45:46;"territory of like being in Central PA and Hershey PA where it's like, hey, our best guess of like,"
01:45:46;01:45:50;"maybe someone knows what's going on with me. But you know, like when those boxes came out,"
01:45:50;01:45:54;"they're like, is this like this looks like someone like a like a child drew this,"
01:45:54;01:45:59;"is this like going to be okay? You know, and we're like, Oh, this is so rad. This is awesome."
01:45:59;01:46:05;"But like that, that was a General Mills Reese's Puffs thing, which I thought was really cool"
01:46:05;01:46:11;"and really fun. But it's like, I would love to do one that is even like more subtle, right?"
01:46:11;01:46:17;"That you don't really even necessarily know. I mean, to me, just because the colorway is so strong,"
01:46:17;01:46:24;"maybe a pair of Crocs that are two different colors. Absolutely not. Where one is. Hold on."
01:46:24;01:46:30;"Or maybe it's like a whole. That was unfair of me. That was unfair. It's a pair of Crocs."
01:46:30;01:46:35;"One's orange and one's brown. And Ryan, do you know what gibbets are? No. You know how"
01:46:35;01:46:42;"now people can put kind of flare on the holes of their Crocs? Yes. And then the gibbets are yellow."
01:46:43;01:46:48;"So between the two shoes, you get all three colors of Reese's pieces and you can move the"
01:46:48;01:46:52;"yellow gibbets around as you see fit. Yes. So you're a part of the collab. So it's you,"
01:46:52;01:47:01;"Crocs and Reese's. Honestly, you could just do Reese's gibbets and then you put them on just a"
01:47:01;01:47:05;"pre-existing pair of Crocs. Yeah. I mean, that could really freshen up a pair, you know? Well,"
01:47:05;01:47:09;"anyway, thanks so much. Please. We'd love to talk to you again, because I feel like actually,"
01:47:09;01:47:13;"the more we talk to you, the more questions come up. I think we barely scratched the surface."
01:47:13;01:47:18;"So hopefully you'll come back. And thanks so much. Thanks, guys. I'll work to get you guys"
01:47:18;01:47:25;"a care package. Terrific. Can't wait for that. And I'll tell you what, as soon as we get that"
01:47:25;01:47:30;"care package, we'll absolutely drop the investigation because it's gone on too long."
01:47:30;01:47:35;"Too many lives have been ruined. That's a fair trade. Because I can talk to the plant, which"
01:47:35;01:47:40;"formula did you guys want for the care package? Because even though it is, we're kind of in that,"
01:47:40;01:47:45;"we're in that transitional period right now, where I'd love to go either way. So I didn't"
01:47:45;01:47:49;"know which one you guys wanted. I'd love to get a jumpstart on winter just so I can flex"
01:47:49;01:47:55;"other people in the neighborhood. So like, yeah, walk by. Oh, you guys still need that summer"
01:47:55;01:48:00;"formula? Oh, I agree. All right. Well, thanks so much, dude. Thanks, guys. Have a great night"
01:48:00;01:48:07;"or day. You too."
01:48:34;01:48:38;"Another great call. This has really been a fascinating investigative"
01:48:38;01:48:44;"TC. Also, I don't know if we said it on the show, but Ryan Reese, his last name is spelled R-I-E-S-S."
01:48:44;01:48:51;"Just a weird coincidence that he works for the company that makes Reese's, R-E-E-S-E."
01:48:51;01:48:56;"Because we had two guests and we've enjoyed talking to them so much, I don't think it makes"
01:48:56;01:48:59;"sense to do a top five this one. I think we're a little short on time. I think we're a little"
01:48:59;01:49:04;"short on time. And also, speaking of investigative journalism, there's something we wanted to get to,"
01:49:04;01:49:10;"because actually, Seinfeld, another thing, I would say over the past two weeks, the top two things"
01:49:10;01:49:16;"that I was getting tagged on, people texting me, all this stuff, were LeBron wearing the Grateful"
01:49:16;01:49:22;"Dead outfit and the other one was Travis Scott doing a collab with McDonald's. All I know is"
01:49:22;01:49:27;"that something happened. I literally don't know what they did together. So Seinfeld, we got you"
01:49:27;01:49:32;"on the case. We got you to Tom O'Neill this sh*t. What did you find out? Let me start off by asking"
01:49:32;01:49:38;"you a question, Ezra. Yeah. Do you have a go-to order for McDonald's? I haven't gone to McDonald's"
01:49:38;01:49:45;"in a long time, but I don't exactly have a go-to, but this comes up in conversation a lot where"
01:49:45;01:49:51;"people say, ""What was your favorite extra value meal?"" And for me, a long time, I was a Big Mac"
01:49:51;01:49:58;"extra value meal guy, but eventually, I became a two cheeseburger guy, because I just thought that"
01:49:58;01:50:03;"was fun that you got two cheeseburgers, you unwrap one, then you unwrap the other. There was something"
01:50:03;01:50:08;"about the ceremony, the presentation of it. It felt like you were getting more bang for your buck"
01:50:08;01:50:12;"getting the two cheeseburger meal. So whatever, I'll stand by that. I'm a two cheeseburger extra"
01:50:12;01:50:18;"value meal guy. You know what? I feel you on that. I will still go to McDonald's from time to time,"
01:50:18;01:50:22;"and I do get the two cheeseburger meal as well. What I like about it is that the burgers are not"
01:50:22;01:50:27;"too heavy either. And if you don't want to finish the second one, you don't really feel too guilty"
01:50:27;01:50:34;"about it. But I digress. Travis Scott has a go-to, and he's had it since he was a child growing up in"
01:50:34;01:50:41;"Houston. And his go-to is a quarter pounder with lettuce, pickles, onions, ketchup, mustard cheese,"
01:50:42;01:50:47;"and bacon. And then he gets medium fries, and he gets a side of barbecue dip."
01:50:47;01:50:51;"Okay. Sorry. That was a lot to take in. So you got a quarter pounder and you add all this."
01:50:51;01:50:57;"Slow down. Wait. Did it even occur to me that you could like, customize anything at McDonald's? I"
01:50:57;01:51:02;"know you could ask for like, ""Yo, can I get some barbecue sauce?"" Whatever. But when you described"
01:51:02;01:51:08;"the burger, you said it was a quarter pounder with ketchup. Yeah, mustard, cheese."
01:51:08;01:51:11;"Are all those things just part of a quarter pounder?"
01:51:11;01:51:18;"So everything there is part of a quarter pounder except for bacon. So Travis likes to customize"
01:51:18;01:51:22;"his quarter pounder by adding bacon. I think everything else is part of the regular quarter"
01:51:22;01:51:29;"pounder. Whoa. So he was like, seven years old. Just like, his mom's like, ""What do you want?"""
01:51:29;01:51:33;"And he's like, ""Don't know what a quarter pounder, but to add bacon."" Okay. No problem."
01:51:33;01:51:37;"I just felt like if you asked for that s*** at McDonald's, they'd just be like,"
01:51:37;01:51:41;"""The quarter pounder does not come with bacon."" No, I'm asking you to add bacon."
01:51:41;01:51:46;"""Sir, if you want the extra bacon burger, I can get you that."" No, I want the quarter"
01:51:46;01:51:49;"pounder with bacon. Sir, all of the bacon is in the walk-in"
01:51:49;01:51:55;"freezer because breakfast ended three hours ago. But now they do breakfast all day. You know,"
01:51:55;01:51:59;"it's funny. I was just having a conversation with somebody about the fact that it used to be such a"
01:51:59;01:52:04;"big deal. Sorry to digress for a second, Seinfeld, but remember it used to be such a big deal that"
01:52:04;01:52:07;"breakfast ended at McDonald's at 1030? Yep."
01:52:07;01:52:14;"People would be so angry. People would be f***ing yelling, ""It's 1032. Tell me you don't still have"
01:52:14;01:52:18;"that s*** on deck. Tell me you don't have it there."" The classic scene in Falling Down."
01:52:18;01:52:22;"Oh, right. Yeah, the Michael Douglas film. Michael Douglas film. Anyway, yeah."
01:52:22;01:52:27;"And then we were talking about that McDonald's knew they had this interesting obsession in the"
01:52:27;01:52:33;"culture with their breakfast menu. And then they made a big hoopla a few years ago."
01:52:33;01:52:36;"For all I know, it might've been like 10 years ago. I don't remember. They made this big hoopla"
01:52:36;01:52:42;"about now they have breakfast all day. And it was this big deal. Remember, it used to roll up and"
01:52:42;01:52:48;"it was 1030 and it was so dramatic. Now you guys wanted this s***. Now you can have it. Right?"
01:52:48;01:52:50;"Does this sound familiar? They did breakfast all day."
01:52:50;01:52:53;"Yes. And talking about it the other day,"
01:52:53;01:52:59;"we were like, ""They f***ed up."" They had something very special that people coveted, that people"
01:52:59;01:53:05;"talked about, that people fought about, and they just threw it in the dumpster. And so I was"
01:53:05;01:53:10;"thinking, ""All right, if I was McDonald's and let's say I was like the Ryan Reese of McDonald's"
01:53:10;01:53:14;"and my boss calls me and is like, 'We need something special, man. Breakfast sales are"
01:53:14;01:53:19;"flagging. What do we do?' And this is my solution."" Rather than say, ""Well, let's make it all day"
01:53:19;01:53:23;"because then you'll have some people coming in for lunch, some people still want breakfast,"
01:53:23;01:53:26;"double the sales."" No, that's not how it works. This is what my thing would have been."
01:53:27;01:53:33;"I would have made a giant campaign, get Bruno Mars to write a song, make this giant hoopla"
01:53:33;01:53:38;"that we're going to do a f***ing huge announcement. And then we f***ing do this crazy media blitz."
01:53:38;01:53:45;"And the whole campaign is about that McDonald's breakfast is now served until 1045. And we make"
01:53:45;01:53:55;"all these songs about 15 minutes. And we make the most expensive commercial in history where literally"
01:53:55;01:54:03;"Jesus Christ comes back to earth. The president, we get everybody, Beyonce. And it's this huge"
01:54:03;01:54:08;"announcement, like a full, the council of the most important people throughout history. And"
01:54:08;01:54:13;"that's all they announce that it's 15 minutes. And Seinfeld, you'll come up with a catchy slogan"
01:54:13;01:54:18;"or something about the most important 15 minutes in history or some s***. I don't know, whatever."
01:54:18;01:54:22;"And let's Bruno Mars do the song. And we just make this huge thing about that, this extra 15"
01:54:22;01:54:27;"minutes. Now that's exciting. That's a cultural reset. You know what I mean?"
01:54:27;01:54:32;"Yeah, it's a movement. I'm picturing the commercial, a family piles into a minivan."
01:54:32;01:54:37;"Dad's like, we got to go. We got to go. Mom's like, hurry it up, hurry it up. Baby wearing"
01:54:37;01:54:42;"like half a diaper, you know, like all that. The whole family gets in the minivan. They screech"
01:54:42;01:54:47;"off. They're like running red lights. They get to McDonald's. It's like 1032. They're like so mad."
01:54:47;01:54:53;"They're like, oh, the dad rolls up. He's like, you know, can I? I know it's two minutes late."
01:54:53;01:54:57;"And then the person behind the counter is like, don't worry about it. Now breakfast is served"
01:54:57;01:55:02;"until 1045, you know, and then it's the Bruno Mars kicks in. You know, this is still a work"
01:55:02;01:55:08;"in progress pitch on the way there. The wife is like, so help me God, Larry, you lost your job."
01:55:08;01:55:14;"You don't take care of your family. And I swear to God, if you don't get us there in time to give"
01:55:14;01:55:19;"your family egg McMuffins, I will divorce you. I will take the kids. I will leave you. And he's"
01:55:19;01:55:25;"just like, it's like a full action movie. Then he screeches up and it's like, that's another campaign."
01:55:25;01:55:29;"That's like later. It's like very serious black and white talking heads. What a 15 minutes mean"
01:55:29;01:55:37;"to you? 15 minutes saved my marriage. 15 minutes saved my life. 15 minutes helped me win the game."
01:55:37;01:55:42;"15 minutes. Let me graduate high school. And then at the end, it's like, you know, McDonald's,"
01:55:42;01:55:47;"what will you do with the new 15 minutes? I love it. It does beg the question though,"
01:55:47;01:55:54;"of like, what kind of like family with children is serving their kids breakfast at 1030. Maybe"
01:55:54;01:55:59;"it's a Saturday. I think it's after church. I think it's Sunday. It's a post church tradition."
01:55:59;01:56:05;"It's a Christian family. True. I like that. That could be another one for religious people."
01:56:05;01:56:10;"And this could be the one that has Jesus Christ in it. Is that preachers going a little bit long"
01:56:10;01:56:15;"with the sermon? Oh, look at the watch. And just like, dude, everybody in the pews is just like"
01:56:15;01:56:20;"looking at their watch, like tapping their foot, like pulling their collar. Yikes. Oh, come on,"
01:56:20;01:56:25;"wrap it up. And then he's just like, and furthermore, he was like, no. And then one guy's"
01:56:25;01:56:30;"like, I'm going to hell. I don't care. And he like jumps in his car and leaves. And then everybody's"
01:56:30;01:56:34;"like freaking out. And then the priest looks at the camera and is like, what are they freaking"
01:56:34;01:56:44;"out about? McDonald's serves breakfast until 1045 now. Just to build on that too. Yes. I was"
01:56:44;01:56:49;"going to suggest that in the rush to get to McDonald's, the person behind, you know what,"
01:56:49;01:56:54;"this is too dark, actually. I'm not going to say it. Oh, no. Too dark for TC. Oh, Lord. Well,"
01:56:54;01:56:58;"I was going to say, OK, that the person in the rush to McDonald's hits somebody. And then when"
01:56:58;01:57:04;"we do Ezra's like kind of somber, like alternate version, it's like that person who got hit was"
01:57:04;01:57:08;"just like, if only the paramedics had been here 15 minutes sooner, you know, like you do an"
01:57:08;01:57:14;"alternate, you like cut to that person, you follow their narrative anyway. Oh, yeah. Wow. No, no. But"
01:57:14;01:57:19;"that's another type of ad, like the really weird sanctimonious one where it actually could have"
01:57:19;01:57:24;"nothing to do with it, where it's just like, what is 15 minutes mean to you? And a surgeon is like"
01:57:24;01:57:30;"another 15 minutes. I could have saved that man's life. What a 15 minutes mean to you? Another 15"
01:57:30;01:57:36;"minutes. I could have told grandma that I loved her. What a 15 minutes mean to you? It's like"
01:57:36;01:57:42;"what's the name? Bill Buckner, some another 15 minutes. We could have won the World Series."
01:57:42;01:57:49;"What a 15 minutes mean to you? And it's like a general. I could have saved 500 American lives."
01:57:49;01:57:52;"And then it's like, what a 15 minutes mean to you? And it's like at McDonald's, we know how"
01:57:52;01:58:01;"much 15 minutes. It like never even shows the product. It's just like black, like the black"
01:58:01;01:58:05;"and white and the arches come up at McDonald's. We know the 15 minutes could change the world."
01:58:05;01:58:12;"That's the Super Bowl ad. But yeah, that's the really serious Super Bowl ad"
01:58:13;01:58:19;"with everything. Soldiers, doctors, all the serious professions."
01:58:20;01:58:25;"Last time I wrecked it. Last time I whipped around. Last time I did the whippers. Last time"
01:58:25;01:58:29;"I live reverse. Porter Brown hit the reverend. Last time I hit your crib. Last time it was"
01:58:29;01:58:34;"your tennis. I done went back in my cell. Felt like hell. I risked it, pace yourself. How you"
01:58:34;01:58:38;"living? Know you thrilling, off the center. How I got my choice in fitness. Back in the house,"
01:58:38;01:58:43;"in the street. Run this wild, let it be. Rage is how I got it. Eat. Not a vibe, but a way."
01:58:43;01:58:49;"With the sound, by the way. Count it down by the days. To myself, know they fuck it with the moves."
01:58:49;01:58:52;"I'm drunk off the juice. No, I'm drunk off this mood. And I lose it."
01:58:52;01:58:54;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:58:54;01:59:01;"So as part of this collaboration, Travis and McDonald's have like branded that meal. So for"
01:59:01;01:59:09;"$6 until October 8th, you can order the Travis Scott meal and you can get the classic Travis"
01:59:09;01:59:14;"Scott quarter pounder with bacon, the medium fries with barbecue sauce and a medium spread."
01:59:14;01:59:15;"Sounds pretty good."
01:59:15;01:59:21;"And this collaboration is actually the first time that McDonald's has put a celebrity's name"
01:59:21;01:59:27;"on a product since 1992 with the McJordan burger after Michael Jordan."
01:59:27;01:59:27;"Wow."
01:59:27;01:59:32;"So this is a big deal. It's been 30 years since McDonald's has done a move like this"
01:59:32;01:59:37;"and who better to do it with than the innovator himself, Travis Scott. But I would say the more"
01:59:37;01:59:40;"interesting part of this collaboration is actually the merchandise."
01:59:40;01:59:42;"Oh yeah, there it is."
01:59:42;01:59:44;"I was kind of waiting if you were going to be like, and that's it."
01:59:45;01:59:47;"That's like, that's kind of interestingly subtle."
01:59:47;01:59:53;"It's no, it's way more. That's just the tip of the iceberg. That's just the loss leader."
01:59:53;02:00:00;"Travis Scott, under his Cactus Jack brand, has created with McDonald's 59 pieces of merchandise."
02:00:00;02:00:01;"Oh my God."
02:00:01;02:00:06;"Everything from a plain T-shirt with the McDonald's logo, but instead of McDonald's,"
02:00:06;02:00:13;"it says Cactus Jack all the way to their most adventurous item, which is a chicken nugget"
02:00:13;02:00:17;"body pillow for $90. That's a hyper-realistic,"
02:00:17;02:00:22;"large body pillow that looks exactly like a chicken nugget that you can sleep with at night."
02:00:22;02:00:26;"See, this is kind of interesting. It's like, we've definitely reached this point where"
02:00:26;02:00:31;"the same way that like American industry was like destroyed because we don't make anything anymore."
02:00:31;02:00:36;"And our factories have all been outsourced and we're basically just a whole country of ideas,"
02:00:36;02:00:42;"people guilty as charged. On the one hand, you know, two brands can come together to make something."
02:00:43;02:00:46;"We were talking about like how Chinatown market, though, you need this third party to bring"
02:00:46;02:00:52;"Grateful Dead and Crocs together. And like, surely McDonald's could just team up with a"
02:00:52;02:00:56;"body pillow company to make something. But it's like, it's not even like McDonald's and"
02:00:56;02:01:02;"Travis Scott team up for like, I guess in the past it would have been like a rap song about"
02:01:02;02:01:09;"McDonald's or like a McDonald's product, like a Big Mac box with Travis Scott on it."
02:01:09;02:01:13;"Things that are just direct. Now there's this weird third party stuff that's just like"
02:01:13;02:01:16;"Travis Scott, you know, like you said, he's a huge innovator. He was brought in,"
02:01:16;02:01:24;"not just as a celebrity, but as like a Ryan Reese, like a strategy guy. And Travis Scott said,"
02:01:24;02:01:29;"well, you know, I'm happy to brand a meal with my name, but I also just want to help you create"
02:01:29;02:01:33;"products that are meaningful to people. And I'm going to help you make a chicken McNugget body"
02:01:33;02:01:39;"pillow. You know what I mean? It's not a direct collab. He's like McKinsey or something. He's a"
02:01:39;02:01:44;"consulting agency being like, you guys should be in the body pillow business. That's right."
02:01:44;02:01:49;"He's it's almost like a creative director capacity beyond just because he's an artist. So they want"
02:01:49;02:01:56;"to mine his beautiful brain for, for some of these more adventurous ideas, like the CJ arches, uh,"
02:01:56;02:02:03;"jorts that he's selling. These are denim jean shorts that are being sold for $250."
02:02:03;02:02:07;"And they have the McDonald's, the golden arches with some sort of like French fry,"
02:02:07;02:02:12;"like cactus Jack flares. But so it's Seinfeld, you being a bit of a hype beast,"
02:02:12;02:02:16;"would you cop any of this stuff? Well, I'm so glad you asked Ezra because, you know,"
02:02:16;02:02:21;"I will say that like a few of these shirts of which there are so many, I'm counting about"
02:02:22;02:02:27;"30 different t-shirt options here. You know, some of them are kind of jazzy and there's one with"
02:02:27;02:02:31;"like the Travis Scott, like custom action figure and some real like nineties style, like almost"
02:02:31;02:02:40;"like what looks like a Nike kind of retro kind of design from like 1996, like just a real loud,"
02:02:40;02:02:43;"loud sort of print. And there's some tie dye stuff in there. But you know, the thing that was a real"
02:02:43;02:02:49;"deal breaker for me, because I thought, Oh, this might be a cool thing in 20 years. Oh, this was"
02:02:49;02:02:54;"like a weird thing that McDonald's did. And now it's like got some value or some cachet to it,"
02:02:54;02:03:00;"but wearing clothing with the McDonald's logo on it. That's like a deal breaker for me. And Jake,"
02:03:00;02:03:03;"I don't know if you remember, but I, at one point on our text thread, I was like, I think this was"
02:03:03;02:03:08;"months ago, but I was like, I was like, I don't understand Coca-Cola as like a thing that people"
02:03:08;02:03:13;"want to wear on their clothes. Do you remember that? I was like, yeah, what is the, what's the"
02:03:13;02:03:21;"appeal of wearing a big ad for Coca-Cola? Like I see no, I see nothing cool about that. And I got"
02:03:21;02:03:26;"the same vibe from this collaboration, which is like, regardless of how much of Travis is like"
02:03:26;02:03:33;"design instincts or whatever, you still walking around with a big McDonald's ad on your shirt,"
02:03:33;02:03:39;"which to me, I think the interesting part of this collaboration is that try as they might to make"
02:03:39;02:03:45;"McDonald's, the logo seem cool. It's a bridge too far. I just can't go there. You know, I can't go"
02:03:45;02:03:50;"all the way with you, Travis. It's also cool if it's vintage, like, well, I guess you could debate"
02:03:50;02:03:56;"it, but I have at times, mostly just on stage. There's a while where I had this, I don't know"
02:03:56;02:04:02;"why, but in the eighties, there was this thing where they made Coca-Cola rugby shirts. And"
02:04:02;02:04:07;"obviously I've always loved rugby shirts. It's been like part of my early look. And I actually"
02:04:07;02:04:11;"felt like it's cool. And I've, and I always see those at vintage stores and I'm always like kind"
02:04:11;02:04:15;"of charmed by them, but that feels a little different than buying like a brand new Coca-Cola"
02:04:15;02:04:19;"t-shirt. And it's funny, as we've been talking about this, I was starting to remember, like,"
02:04:19;02:04:23;"I feel like in the nineties, marijuana parody shirts was like a huge thing."
02:04:23;02:04:24;"Yes."
02:04:24;02:04:29;"So I've been looking some up, like there's vegan ones that just say McMurder. That's pretty harsh"
02:04:29;02:04:34;"to wear. But the really funny ones, it's just the McDonald's golden arches M and then it says"
02:04:34;02:04:40;"marijuana. I feel like that's like a classic. That's a classic. That's like a classic boardwalk."
02:04:40;02:04:45;"Yeah, definitely. And I guess there's some that were sold as like tourist things in Mexico."
02:04:45;02:04:50;"Like I'm seeing, you know, that kind of like, they call it a hoodie. I've always heard it"
02:04:50;02:04:57;"called a Baja, you know, like the Mexican pullover. So this is a white Baja with the"
02:04:57;02:05:02;"marijuana on it. It just says marijuana over 1 billion stone Mexico."
02:05:03;02:05:05;"I'm like, this is kind of cool."
02:05:05;02:05:10;"The first time I ever saw those McDonald's marijuana shirts was in Mexico when I was a kid."
02:05:10;02:05:11;"Oh, really?"
02:05:11;02:05:13;"And being like, oh, that's so bad ass. Yeah."
02:05:13;02:05:18;"Yeah. I think I'd wear a marijuana McDonald's parody long sleeve t-shirt."
02:05:18;02:05:20;"Let me see if I can find one. So anyway,"
02:05:20;02:05:28;"This episode is ending with Ezra just like browsing for like McDonald's parody shirts."
02:05:30;02:05:34;"That's right. I'm going to find a bunch. I'll give you guys some too. All right. Well,"
02:05:34;02:05:38;"I'm just going to keep browsing. I got to get my head back into the into the browsing game."
02:05:38;02:05:40;"That's it for TC. See you guys in two weeks."
02:05:40;02:05:41;"Peace."
