06:31;06:33;"Yeah, and then we took a break"
06:34;06:40;"And this DJ took over and I thought the scene would be like people like just watch us for an hour and a half"

07:50;07:53;"Yeah"
07:53;08:02;"I was walking 'round from a nice square, not a chill to the winter but a dip to the air"
08:02;08:10;"From the other direction she was calling my name"
08:10;08:17;"It could be an illusion but I might as well try, might as well try"
08:21;08:25;"She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes"
08:25;08:31;"And I knew without asking she was into the blues"
08:31;08:38;"She wore Scarlet Bernardinus tucked into her clothes"
08:38;08:45;"I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls"
08:45;08:47;"Is there some Taco Bell news Jake?"
08:47;08:48;"Yeah"
08:49;08:51;"Corporate food history"
08:51;08:54;"Let's talk about it"
08:54;09:00;"2018 is already off to a weird-ass start. I guess this actually happened last year"
09:00;09:07;"So Taco Bell unveiled a new commercial last month. It's called the Belluminati"
09:07;09:08;"Okay"
09:08;09:10;"I'm looking at the YouTube. This is what they wrote"
09:10;09:15;"The rumors are true. The signs have been there all along. There's a powerful connection between the dollar and Taco Bell"
09:15;09:17;"This is how the ad goes"
09:18;09:22;"There's a powerful connection between the dollar and Taco Bell"
09:22;09:30;"Because it unlocks a world of 20 decadent menu items from breakfast to late night for just a dollar each"
09:30;09:32;"20 items for a dollar"
09:32;09:35;"20 steps on the pyramid"
09:35;09:38;"Who's really behind this?"
09:38;09:42;"Is it the Illuminati or the Belluminati?"
09:42;09:45;"Experience the power of the dollar at Taco Bell"
09:46;09:48;"That's hilarious"
09:48;09:55;"So you're familiar with the conspiracy theory that the Illuminati is an elite secretive group that controls the world"
09:55;09:58;"And they hide their little signs in the dollar"
09:58;10:04;"And it's kind of like a meme. People kind of jokingly find a triangle in anything as proof that the Illuminati controls the world"
10:04;10:08;"I love corporations going all in on conspiracy theories"
10:08;10:13;"Like Carl's Jr. has a JFK assassination ad coming out in March"
10:14;10:16;"I don't even know what the angle would be but"
10:16;10:18;"Carl was there"
10:18;10:20;"Carl was the second shooter"
10:20;10:26;"Wendy's 9/11 was an inside job"
10:26;10:31;"Papa John's birther conspiracy"
10:31;10:34;"That one's not that far from the truth"
10:34;10:36;"Wait so what happened with this?"
10:36;10:40;"Taco Bell basically made a joke about the Illuminati"
10:40;10:44;"And Charlie Daniels, famous country musician, older guy"
10:44;10:46;"He had the song ""Devil Went Down to Georgia"""
10:46;10:48;"And he's a noted conservative"
10:48;10:51;"He got on Twitter and said"
10:51;10:54;"""Hey Taco Bell, the Illuminati is not a frivolous subject"""
10:54;10:57;"14,000 retweets, 40,000 likes"
10:57;10:59;"That's all he said, he kept it real simple"
10:59;11:02;"The Illuminati is not a frivolous subject"
11:02;11:03;"Yes it is"
11:03;11:04;"Well it's debatable"
11:04;11:05;"I mean the funny thing is"
11:05;11:08;"The forces that control our world, it's so obvious"
11:08;11:09;"They're in plain sight"
11:09;11:11;"There's also something funny about"
11:11;11:12;"Charlie Daniels being like"
11:12;11:14;"""Hey Taco Bell, giant corporation"
11:14;11:16;"Owned by an even bigger corporation"
11:16;11:20;"Don't joke around about consolidated power"""
11:20;11:24;"Stay in your lane T-Bell"
11:24;11:26;"Yeah it's like we're all such morons"
11:26;11:28;"He literally could talk to Taco Bell and be like"
11:28;11:32;"""Now listen guys, the fact that one company"
11:32;11:35;"Has outposts in every community in North America"
11:35;11:39;"Selling them ""Mexican food"""
11:39;11:40;"That's cool"
11:40;11:44;"But the idea that there's forces in this world"
11:44;11:46;"That infiltrate the way we live"
11:46;11:48;"Is no joke man"
11:48;11:49;"Is he trying to say like"
11:49;11:51;"The Illuminati's real"
11:51;11:55;"And you're getting into dangerous waters here"
11:55;11:56;"Oh is that what he's saying?"
11:56;11:57;"Is that what he's saying?"
11:57;11:58;"Yeah I think he's basically"
11:58;11:59;"I think he's saying"
11:59;12:00;"""Taco Bell you're joking about the Illuminati"
12:00;12:03;"But the Illuminati is real and dangerous and bad"""
12:03;12:04;"They're watching you"
12:04;12:05;"It's like the ending of Network"
12:05;12:07;"It's like the way people talk to politicians"
12:07;12:09;"It's like, and he seems like he is a Trump supporter"
12:09;12:12;"But it's like when Trump supporters"
12:12;12:15;"Wanna kinda make excuses for him"
12:15;12:17;"Explain why he's doing such moronic stuff or something"
12:17;12:21;"They often will talk about him"
12:21;12:26;"As if he's the victim of powerful conspiratorial forces"
12:26;12:27;"And it's kind of like"
12:27;12:29;"You're literally defending a billionaire"
12:29;12:32;"Like that's a conspiracy in plain sight man"
12:32;12:35;"A rich dude inherited money from his family"
12:35;12:36;"Became a billionaire through like"
12:36;12:38;"Whack real estate practices"
12:38;12:39;"And now he's president"
12:39;12:41;"Cutting taxes for corporations"
12:41;12:42;"It's right there"
12:42;12:43;"That's how the world works"
12:43;12:45;"That's how power in this world works"
12:45;12:47;"But instead people wanna be like"
12:47;12:48;"Mr. Trump"
12:48;12:49;"Watch out"
12:49;12:50;"We got your back man"
12:50;12:51;"We got your back"
12:51;12:53;"We know that powerful forces are trying to hurt you"
12:53;12:54;"It's absurd"
12:54;12:57;"We're with you through thick and thin"
12:57;12:59;"Every man is not created equal"
12:59;13:01;"We're all created mad different"
13:01;13:02;"Some are bad people"
13:02;13:04;"The bald eagles, mad evil"
13:04;13:05;"Place you in the class C"
13:05;13:06;"Feed your placebo"
13:06;13:08;"Check the cops with corse bone and quarters"
13:08;13:09;"Sooner than the pack"
13:09;13:10;"Think they're tapping your computer"
13:10;13:11;"Your computer is a tap"
13:11;13:13;"Coupon traffickers wanna track you"
13:13;13:14;"Your computer is a map"
13:14;13:15;"Forget whoever fingerprints"
13:15;13:16;"They got a mask, they got a Mac"
13:16;13:18;"Every app that's on your jacks"
13:18;13:19;"Forgetting Jack"
13:19;13:20;"Every act on every bill"
13:20;13:21;"And every law and every bill"
13:21;13:22;"And every act is game"
13:22;13:24;"This run so they can run up where you at"
13:24;13:26;"They got patting down, down, back"
13:26;13:27;"They gotta give 'em that"
13:27;13:28;"Now it's money that I never had"
13:28;13:29;"I'm supposed to give it back"
13:29;13:31;"To keep statistics on the gifted young and black"
13:31;13:32;"They put out statistics"
13:32;13:34;"People read 'em act like they be giving fact"
13:34;13:35;"That they be giving lean"
13:35;13:36;"When they been giving fat"
13:36;13:39;"There is something that I don't love about this current wave of like"
13:39;13:41;"All the brands are self-aware now"
13:41;13:44;"I guess this has been happening for 20, 30 years in advertising"
13:44;13:47;"But Taco Bell's riffing on like a conspiracy theory"
13:47;13:50;"It's kind of similar to how all the brands"
13:50;13:53;"Have these like kind of funny Twitter accounts"
13:53;13:55;"Right, wait who was that that had the"
13:55;13:57;"Was that Wendy's or Arby's or something?"
13:57;13:58;"Wendy's and Arby's"
13:58;14:02;"Wendy's will quote unquote roast a hater"
14:02;14:03;"Really?"
14:03;14:04;"Yeah, I forget who it is"
14:04;14:07;"I think it might be Jack Wagner aka Versace Tamagotchi"
14:07;14:10;"I've seen him every time like these brands"
14:10;14:11;"Try to do some funny stuff"
14:11;14:13;"'Cause sometimes the brand Twitter accounts"
14:13;14:14;"Will like get into a beef"
14:14;14:16;"And like so this guy Jack Wagner"
14:16;14:17;"Will sometimes like tweet at both of them like"
14:17;14:19;"Oh guys it's like a hilarious bit"
14:19;14:21;"Yo here's an even funnier way that Wendy's"
14:21;14:22;"You could have one-upped Arby's"
14:22;14:25;"What if you paid your employees more than minimum wage"
14:25;14:27;"And gave them health benefits?"
14:27;14:29;"So it'll kind of like get in there"
14:29;14:32;"'Cause there is this kind of like fake personality"
14:32;14:36;"To the brand that kind of puts it above criticism"
14:36;14:39;"Where there's like we're just self-aware just like you"
14:39;14:42;"We're into memes, like to joke around"
14:42;14:45;"But really it's like one person that they hired"
14:45;14:48;"To do social media for this bizarre"
14:48;14:50;"That's great, I mean that's just like the end of"
14:50;14:53;"I mean is it fair to say that's like the end of irony?"
14:53;14:54;"If it's no longer"
14:54;14:57;"If irony is no longer at all subversive or like"
14:57;14:58;"That's a good point"
14:58;14:59;"It kind of makes"
14:59;15:00;"Cutting?"
15:00;15:02;"Yeah it makes irony seem corny"
15:02;15:03;"Right"
15:03;15:05;"There was a big one recently"
15:05;15:08;"When our psychotic president tweeted"
15:08;15:11;"About how Kim Jong-un thinks that he's got"
15:11;15:12;"A nuclear button on his desk"
15:12;15:14;"Well will somebody tell him that I have a much bigger"
15:14;15:16;"More powerful one than him?"
15:16;15:18;"You know he wrote this like stupid tweet"
15:18;15:19;"Right, right, right, right"
15:19;15:22;"Well so then the KFC UK account did a parody of it"
15:22;15:23;"And they wrote McDonald's leader Ronald just stated"
15:23;15:25;"He has a burger on his desk all the time"
15:25;15:27;"Will someone please inform him blah blah blah"
15:27;15:29;"That I have a bigger box meal"
15:29;15:30;"And mine has gravy"
15:30;15:32;"It's like they tried to do some riff on"
15:32;15:36;"As if I guess in their world view"
15:36;15:38;"Ronald McDonald is Kim Jong-un"
15:38;15:41;"This got 189,000 retweets"
15:41;15:42;"I'm looking at an article where it's just like"

15:44;15:46;"""Bahaha this is awesome"""
15:46;15:48;"I also like love that"
15:48;15:49;"Just like imagine being the type of person"
15:49;15:51;"On Twitter"
15:51;15:54;"You just like quote the KFC UK account"
15:54;15:57;"And just like savage"
15:57;15:58;"I love this"
15:58;16:01;"Imagine the like office the next morning"
16:01;16:02;"At the KFC"
16:02;16:04;"Or like the social media office"
16:04;16:06;"At the KFC headquarters"
16:06;16:08;"And they're just like head over heels"
16:08;16:11;"189,000 retweets but not everybody liked it"
16:11;16:12;"Somebody wrote"
16:12;16:14;"When you idiots are done chuckling about this"
16:14;16:15;"There will be no US left"
16:15;16:17;"And everyone will think that you invented"
16:17;16:18;"Eating garbage food"
16:18;16:20;"Somebody wrote not funny"
16:20;16:21;"I got it"
16:21;16:22;"It's like"
16:22;16:25;"Getting psyched about the KFC savage burns"
16:25;16:27;"On Twitter is hilarious"
16:27;16:29;"Also getting like indignant"
16:29;16:31;"Is almost equally hilarious"

19:36;19:37;"Yeah."
19:37;19:39;"A rare occurrence on Time Crisis,"
19:39;19:41;"I found some good stuff in the mailbag recently."
19:41;19:44;"Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
19:44;19:46;"Yeah, you know what, though?"
19:46;19:48;"I'm struggling with this, uh, cold."
19:48;19:49;"Yeah."
19:49;19:50;"You want me to read it?"
19:50;19:51;"I think so."
19:51;19:52;"Okay."
19:52;19:54;"So this is an email Jake got"
19:54;19:56;"from Sarah Podobnik."
19:56;19:58;"I'm guessing Podobnik."
19:58;19:59;"Sorry."
19:59;20:00;"I don't know."
20:00;20:02;"Eight Minute Cape Cod"
20:02;20:03;"She said,"
20:03;20:05;"""Hey Jake and Time Crisis crew."
20:05;20:07;"Sorry to intrude on your inbox,"
20:07;20:09;"but I thought this recent story might fit well"
20:09;20:11;"with the TC corporate interest."
20:11;20:14;"This story is about Canada's most popular fast food chain,"
20:14;20:15;"Tim Hortons."""
20:15;20:17;"You're familiar with Tim Hortons, right?"
20:17;20:18;"I'm actually not."
20:18;20:20;"Are they in the U.S.?"
20:20;20:21;"Ah, yes."
20:21;20:23;"There's a couple, but it's really Canadian."
20:23;20:25;"Have you been in Canada on tour?"
20:25;20:26;"Yeah."
20:26;20:27;"I think of it as having coffee and donuts."
20:27;20:28;"You know what?"
20:28;20:29;"We got a Canadian right here."
20:29;20:30;"Hey, what's up?"
20:30;20:31;"What's up, Seinfeld 2000?"
20:31;20:32;"How's it going?"
20:32;20:34;"I want to remind people again that"
20:34;20:37;"even though your favorite TV show"
20:37;20:39;"was set in New York,"
20:39;20:41;"a very American show, Seinfeld,"
20:41;20:45;"you in fact come from the great white north, Canada."
20:45;20:47;"That's correct, I do."
20:47;20:50;"We did have access to Seinfeld up there"
20:50;20:52;"along with other American television shows,"
20:52;20:55;"but yes, I am from the north that is white."
20:55;20:58;"So I'm sure you got a lot to say about this,"
20:58;20:59;"but I want to get to the email."
20:59;21:02;"But just quickly, what is Tim Hortons?"
21:02;21:03;"Is it like Dunkin' Donuts?"
21:03;21:05;"I would say that's a good comparison"
21:05;21:07;"in terms of how widespread it is,"
21:07;21:09;"but it's a cut above Dunkin'."
21:09;21:13;"I would say it exists in the space of like,"
21:13;21:15;"in terms of level of quality"
21:15;21:18;"between Dunkin' and Starbucks."
21:18;21:20;"But is it also kind of like a convenience store?"
21:20;21:22;"Could you buy a bag of Doritos there?"
21:22;21:23;"You can't get Doritos."
21:23;21:25;"You could get a bottle of Coke or Sprite,"
21:25;21:28;"but it's coffee, donuts, and sandwiches."
21:28;21:30;"Can you get a breakfast sandwich?"
21:30;21:31;"Like an egg and cheese?"
21:31;21:33;"Oh, you could get a breakfast sandwich for sure."
21:33;21:35;"Full disclosure, like that was my first job ever"
21:35;21:36;"was at Tim Hortons."
21:36;21:37;"So like I can..."
21:37;21:38;"I love it."
21:38;21:39;"Yeah."
21:39;21:40;"So you've been in the belly of the beast."
21:40;21:42;"I've been deep in the heart of darkness."
21:42;21:44;"Canadians tend to like love Tim Hortons"
21:44;21:46;"because it represents Canada."
21:46;21:47;"That's true."
21:47;21:50;"It's a very stereotypical Canadian thing."
21:50;21:53;"Tim Horton is a hockey player."
21:53;21:56;"So it doesn't get any more Canadian than that."
21:56;21:58;"So he was a famous hockey player who opened this?"
21:58;22:00;"Yes, he opened it,"
22:00;22:05;"I think it was in 1967 he opened it or '64."
22:05;22:06;"Nice dude."
22:06;22:07;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
22:07;22:08;"A little corporate history on the fly."
22:08;22:09;"A little corporate history, yeah."
22:09;22:11;"He died actually at age 44,"
22:11;22:13;"but it blew up like after his death."
22:13;22:14;"Okay."
22:14;22:16;"Yeah, actually, funny story."
22:16;22:18;"Not that funny, but it was owned by Wendy's"
22:18;22:19;"at a certain point."
22:19;22:21;"In the '90s, Wendy's took it over."
22:21;22:22;"That is a knee slapper."
22:22;22:23;"For a couple of years."
22:23;22:25;"[Laughter]"
22:25;22:26;"You know."
22:26;22:28;"Yeah, it was founded in '64."
22:28;22:30;"Wait, so did Canadians feel weird about that?"
22:30;22:32;"That their beloved Tim Hortons"
22:32;22:35;"was briefly owned by a non-Canadian company?"
22:35;22:37;"Yeah, that was an outrage."
22:37;22:39;"And believe it or not, actually,"
22:39;22:42;"Tim Hortons is now currently owned by Burger King."
22:42;22:43;"Wow."
22:43;22:45;"It's been owned by both Wendy's and Burger King."

23:23;23:24;"""At the beginning of 2018,"
23:24;23:28;"the minimum wage in Ontario increased from $11.60"
23:28;23:30;"to $14 an hour."""
23:30;23:31;"Pretty good."
23:31;23:32;"Yeah."
23:32;23:33;"I mean, we would expect that Canada"
23:33;23:35;"has better minimum wage than America."
23:35;23:38;"""This has caused a huge stir with employers,"
23:38;23:39;"and most recently in the news,"
23:39;23:41;"a couple of Tim Hortons franchises"
23:41;23:43;"owned by the children of Ron Joyce,"
23:43;23:44;"the CEO of Tim Hortons,"
23:44;23:46;"have decided to discontinue paying"
23:46;23:48;"for the majority of benefits and breaks"
23:48;23:51;"to offset the added cost of the minimum wage hike."""
23:51;23:52;"So this is classic."
23:52;23:54;"We hear this in America, too."
23:54;23:56;"If the minimum wage goes up,"
23:56;23:58;"suddenly you get all these people"
23:58;23:59;"owning these businesses being like,"
23:59;24:01;"""Well, I guess I'll have to pay for robots then"
24:01;24:03;"and fire everybody and ruin their lives,"
24:03;24:04;"thanks for, you know,"
24:04;24:07;"and blaming the wage increase."""
24:07;24:09;"So they're trying to slash benefits"
24:09;24:15;"because they can't afford an extra $2.40 an hour."
24:15;24:16;"""A deep dive into Tim's history"
24:16;24:18;"shows that it just was recently sold"
24:18;24:22;"to a Brazilian company for $11.4 billion."""
24:22;24:23;"I think that's probably because, like,"
24:23;24:25;"Burger King's owned by a bigger company"
24:25;24:27;"that's owned by a Brazilian company."
24:27;24:29;"So that's interesting, too."
24:29;24:33;"Really? BK is owned by a Brazilian super corporation?"
24:33;24:34;"That's crazy."
24:34;24:35;"There's a larger company"
24:35;24:38;"called Restaurant Brands International."
24:38;24:39;"RBI."
24:39;24:41;"RBI."
24:41;24:42;"I mean, it's how, you know,"
24:42;24:44;"you follow all these things up high enough,"
24:44;24:47;"and you always end up with some anonymous brand"
24:47;24:51;"I think they, like, purposefully make their brand names,"
24:51;24:54;"like, super innocuous and forgettable."
24:54;24:55;"Okay, so here's what it is."
24:55;24:56;"Restaurant Brands International"
24:56;25:00;"is a Canadian multinational fast food company,"
25:00;25:07;"and they own Burger King and Tim Hortons and Popeyes."
25:07;25:09;"But the company's majority owned"
25:09;25:12;"by the Brazilian investment company 3G Capital,"
25:12;25:14;"holding a 51% stake."
25:14;25:16;"Global capital, man."
25:16;25:17;"God, it's crazy."
25:17;25:19;"It's moving all over the place."
25:19;25:21;"Wait, so Popeyes is Canadian?"
25:21;25:25;"Popeyes is Canadian-Brazilian, I guess."
25:25;25:26;"They're owned?"
25:26;25:28;"They're owned by a Canadian company,"
25:28;25:31;"which in turn is owned by a Brazilian,"
25:31;25:34;"or 51% is owned by a Brazilian."
25:34;25:36;"It's a Brazilian-controlled Canadian company."
25:36;25:37;"I like that."
25:37;25:39;"I thought they were, like, New Orleans."
25:39;25:42;"They brought that New Orleans spice."
25:42;25:44;"Guys, it's very simple."
25:44;25:46;"Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen"
25:46;25:48;"is owned by Restaurant Brands International,"
25:48;25:50;"a Canadian multinational fast food company"
25:50;25:53;"that's majority owned by a Brazilian investment company,"
25:53;25:54;"3G Capital."
25:54;25:56;"So Sarah's making the point that"
25:56;25:59;"when Tim Hortons was sold to this giant company,"
25:59;26:02;"she's suggesting that the children of Ron Joyce,"
26:02;26:05;"who probably already got a lot of money out of it."
26:05;26:07;"So she's like, you know, these people are already rich."
26:07;26:08;"They've made so much money."
26:08;26:11;"Why do they have to be so [bleep]?"
26:11;26:15;"So the franchisees are the offspring of the CEO."
26:15;26:17;"These particular franchisees, yeah."
26:17;26:19;"The story doesn't stop there."
26:19;26:22;"The Premier of Ontario, kind of like an American governor--"
26:22;26:23;"Does that check out, Seinfeld?"
26:23;26:25;"Yeah, I don't know if that's accurate."
26:25;26:26;"A Premier is like a governor?"
26:26;26:28;"Yeah, that's exactly right, yeah."
26:28;26:30;"So the Premier of Ontario got involved with this story,"
26:30;26:33;"and she proceeded to call the store owners bullies"
26:33;26:35;"and to contact her directly with their grievances"
26:35;26:36;"about the wage hike."
26:36;26:38;"I've included a link to an article"
26:38;26:40;"explaining the situation more in depth,"
26:40;26:41;"but this situation asks the question,"
26:41;26:42;"in these corporate companies,"
26:42;26:45;"how much of a profit is necessary for the owners"
26:45;26:48;"before it starts to impede on the employee's quality of life?"
26:48;26:49;"Love the show, guys."
26:49;26:52;"Hope to get Seinfeld 2000's Canadian opinion on this as well."
26:52;26:53;"Thanks, Sarah."
26:53;26:54;"Oh, we've been doing that, Sarah."

28:37;28:39;"Or is there always going to be some sneaky way"
28:39;28:42;"that people put their profits before their employees?"
28:42;28:43;"Yeah."
28:43;28:44;"Which seems to be the case."
28:44;28:46;"I mean, the owners are probably looking at it"
28:46;28:49;"at kind of like a vast chessboard"
28:49;28:50;"where from their perspective,"
28:50;28:54;"each store probably has a pretty slim profit margin."
28:54;28:55;"Right."
28:55;28:57;"And then if you own 400 Tim Hortons,"
28:57;28:59;"then you're cleaning up."
28:59;29:02;"And so it's sort of like, ""Uh-oh."
29:02;29:05;"We already have a slim profit margin on each store,"
29:05;29:08;"and so we're going to shrink that."""
29:08;29:10;"That's what they're thinking."
29:10;29:11;"I was reading about this,"
29:11;29:14;"and the average Tim Hortons franchise"
29:14;29:19;"would stand to lose $243,889"
29:19;29:21;"as a result of the minimum wage hike."
29:21;29:22;"Annually?"
29:22;29:23;"Yes."
29:23;29:24;"But what's their profits?"
29:24;29:25;"That was not--"
29:25;29:29;"I mean, look, $240,000 is a lot of money."
29:29;29:32;"I wonder what a Tim Hortons, like one store,"
29:32;29:34;"what their profit margin is."
29:34;29:36;"That was about my pay grade."
29:36;29:37;"Let's Google that."
29:37;29:38;"Well, that's the problem."
29:38;29:40;"A company like Tim Hortons,"
29:40;29:43;"you think they're this kind vibe Canadian company"
29:43;29:45;"founded by a hockey player."
29:45;29:48;"You let them spread octopus-like,"
29:48;29:51;"their tentacles into every town in Canada."
29:51;29:55;"That replaces the old-school mom-and-pop donut place."
29:55;29:59;"And now you expect them to treat you"
29:59;30:01;"like they're a part of the community"
30:01;30:04;"versus just an investment opportunity"
30:04;30:06;"to try to suck money out?"
30:06;30:07;"Nah."
30:07;30:09;"So between 2002 and 2008,"
30:09;30:11;"the average Tim Hortons franchise"
30:11;30:14;"earned, before interest and taxes,"
30:14;30:16;"$1.5 million a year."
30:16;30:19;"Okay, so potentially we're talking about"
30:19;30:21;"you're making $1.5 million,"
30:21;30:24;"and you're going to go down to $1.25."
30:24;30:25;"Right."
30:25;30:27;"Then taxes and everything."
30:27;30:31;"So yeah, you're cutting your profit margin"
30:31;30:34;"by whatever it is, 18% or something."
30:34;30:36;"So then they're paying some high Canadian taxes."
30:36;30:38;"I don't know, what are they taking home?"
30:38;30:40;"$500 or $600 a year per franchise?"
30:40;30:42;"Come on, that's plenty."
30:42;30:43;"See, that's the thing."
30:43;30:45;"Rich people always think they're broke."
30:45;30:46;"You know, psychologically."
30:46;30:47;"No, it's true."
30:47;30:49;"Because the owner, these people"
30:49;30:50;"who own these Tim Hortons,"
30:50;30:52;"they're not comparing themselves to their employees."
30:52;30:55;"They're comparing themselves to their friend down the street"
30:55;30:58;"who owns 20 Tim Hortons and some Burger Kings."
30:58;31:01;"Or they're looking at the total bottom line."
31:01;31:04;"So if you own 20 Tim Hortons,"
31:04;31:06;"all of a sudden you're paying out"
31:06;31:09;"whatever, $8 million more a year."
31:09;31:10;"Right."
31:10;31:13;"You see that $8 million and you're just like, ""Dude."""
31:13;31:15;"Yeah, or you're just looking at percentages."
31:15;31:18;"You're like, ""Our profits are going down by 20%."
31:18;31:20;"That's crazy."""
31:20;31:22;"Is it?"
31:22;31:26;"What about the value of your people, your employees?"
31:26;31:27;"Well, that's the problem."
31:27;31:29;"Nobody agrees on that."
31:29;31:30;"That's a big problem."
31:30;31:32;"Do you think it's un-Canadian"
31:32;31:34;"what these people are doing, Seinfeld?"
31:34;31:36;"Yeah."
31:36;31:38;"I mean, that's a big question."
31:38;31:41;"But it does seem a little bit"
31:41;31:46;"against the kind of goodwill that Canada stands for."
31:46;31:48;"Supposedly stands for."
31:48;31:49;"Well, guess what?"
31:49;31:51;"There's a boycott called No Timmies Tuesday."
31:51;31:52;"Yeah."
31:52;31:53;"Just Tuesday."
31:53;31:54;"Yeah."
31:54;31:56;"And I think it was just one Tuesday."
31:56;31:57;"I think it was just the first Tuesday."
31:57;32:00;"So people have Tim Hortons as part of their day-to-day commute."
32:00;32:01;"They're stopping in."
32:01;32:02;"Oh, yeah."
32:02;32:03;"100%."
32:03;32:04;"They're getting that."
32:04;32:06;"The boycott calls on Canadians to support"
32:06;32:08;"an independent coffee chain of their choosing"
32:08;32:10;"instead of Tim Hortons on Tuesdays."
32:10;32:13;"Although they say if you're participating in No Nut November,"
32:13;32:16;"they don't expect you to also do No Timmies Tuesday."
32:16;32:18;"That just seems like too much."
32:18;32:19;"You've got to pass."
32:19;32:20;"Yeah."
33:13;33:16;"I recognize your false confidence and calculated promises."
33:16;33:18;"Solid in your conversations."
33:18;33:20;"I hate people that feel entitled."
33:20;33:23;"Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you."
33:23;33:25;"On you according, you the moral to the story."
33:25;33:28;"You endorsing mother [BLEEP] I don't even like you."
33:28;33:30;"Corrupt a man's heart with a gift."
33:30;33:33;"That's how you find out who you're dealing with."
33:33;33:35;"A smart percentage who on building with."
33:35;33:37;"I want the credit if I'm losing or I'm winning."
33:37;33:40;"Oh, my mama that's the realest [BLEEP]"
33:40;33:43;"Bitch, tell 'em about us."
33:43;33:48;"Bitch, you're everything and everything you are for us."
33:48;33:49;"I got the feeling."
33:49;33:50;"Ooh."
33:50;33:52;"Ooh."
33:52;33:54;"I got the feeling."
33:54;33:55;"Ooh."
33:55;33:58;"Ooh."
33:58;34:01;"'Cause maybe the light in my dreams might let me know."
34:01;34:04;"All the scars are bullshit."
34:06;34:08;"All the scars are bullshit."
34:08;34:11;"Maybe the light in my dreams might let me know."
34:11;34:13;"All the scars are bullshit."
34:18;34:22;"Skid row when an ego gets you talking."
34:22;34:25;"I get involved like a rebound."
34:25;34:30;"No control, no off switch in the way that you bringing me down."
34:30;34:31;"It's a turn on."
34:31;34:32;"Get it away from me."
34:32;34:34;"Leave me alone."
34:34;34:35;"Keep away from me."
34:35;34:36;"Let it sound wrong."
34:36;34:37;"Get it away from me."
34:37;34:41;"I, I, I, I, I just cry for no reason."
34:41;34:44;"I just pray for no reason."
34:44;34:47;"I just think for the life, for the day, for the outside,"
34:47;34:49;"another night breathing."
34:49;34:51;"How did it all gonna feel good?"
34:51;34:54;"You let me know that you feel bad."
34:54;34:55;"Better live your life."
34:55;34:59;"We were running out of time."
34:59;35:02;"Bitch, tell 'em about us."
35:02;35:06;"Bitch, you're everything and everything you are for us."
35:06;35:07;"Yeah."
35:07;35:08;"Oh."
35:13;35:16;"Oh."
35:16;35:20;"Maybe the night that my dreams might let me know."
35:20;35:22;"All the scars are bullshit."
35:25;35:27;"All the scars are bullshit."
35:27;35:30;"Maybe the night that my dreams might let me know."
35:30;35:32;"All the scars are bullshit."
35:37;35:41;"All right, so we just took a little break, and I don't think we're done with Tim Hortons."
35:41;35:47;"Because I don't think we've quite made it clear to our non-Canadian listeners"
35:47;35:52;"the extent to which Tim Hortons has insidiously"
35:52;35:55;"wormed its way into the life of every Canadian."
35:55;35:57;"Saturated the landscape."
35:57;35:59;"I mean, 'cause this is America."
35:59;36:01;"We basically invented..."
36:01;36:02;"Chains."
36:03;36:08;"Every American feels like, ""Oh, man, you can't walk a block without seeing a Starbucks."""
36:08;36:09;"A Mickey D's."
36:10;36:11;"Like, we--a Subway."
36:11;36:12;"We feel like--"
36:12;36:13;"A Chase Bank."
36:13;36:15;"We feel like America's the most saturated country."
36:15;36:18;"But how many Tim Hortons are there in Canada?"
36:18;36:22;"There are 3,802 Tim Hortons in Canada."
36:22;36:24;"Okay, so you hear 3,802."
36:24;36:26;"That doesn't sound like that much."
36:26;36:31;"But Canada, although a large country, is not a very populous country."
36:31;36:33;"What is it, 30 million?"
36:33;36:34;"37 million."
36:34;36:35;"Okay."
36:35;36:37;"Get out the old calculator here."
36:37;36:40;"37 million divided by how many?"
36:40;36:43;"3,802."
36:43;36:50;"Okay, so that's one Tim Horton for every 9,700 Canadians."
36:50;36:52;"So let's just call it 10,000."
36:52;36:55;"One Tim Horton for every 10,000 Canadians."
36:55;36:56;"Okay, so--"
36:56;36:58;"Which doesn't--it sounds, like, pretty sparse, actually."
36:58;37:00;"Yeah, it doesn't sound that crazy."
37:00;37:02;"10,000 Canadians have to share one Tim Hortons?"
37:02;37:03;"Right."
37:03;37:04;"Doesn't sound like that much."
37:04;37:05;"Right."
37:05;37:06;"It feels like more."
37:06;37:07;"But let's look at America."
37:07;37:10;"Our population is 323 million."
37:10;37:12;"So what was the ratio, 9,200?"
37:12;37:14;"10,000."
37:14;37:18;"So in America, if we wanted to have one of something for every 10,000 people,"
37:18;37:24;"you would need to have 32,300 of that chain."
37:24;37:27;"And, like, how many Starbucks are there in America?"
37:27;37:28;"In the U.S."
37:28;37:32;"In the U.S., there's 8,222 Starbucks."
37:32;37:35;"Just so people understand, I know we're throwing a lot of numbers at you,"
37:35;37:39;"but America, we feel like there's a Starbucks everywhere you turn."
37:39;37:48;"The ratio of Starbucks per Americans is nowhere even close to the ratio of Canadians to Tim Hortons."
37:48;37:50;"It's 39,000 Americans per Starbucks."
37:50;37:53;"Think about how saturated our country is with Starbucks."
37:53;37:56;"Now imagine you're going to Canada and you're three times more saturated."
37:56;37:57;"Four."
37:57;37:59;"Four times more saturated."
37:59;38:00;"Per capita."
38:00;38:02;"Per capita by Tim Hortons."
38:02;38:03;"That's crazy."
38:03;38:06;"So, yeah, just picture four times as many Starbucks."
38:06;38:08;"I can't even imagine that."
38:08;38:10;"How is that even economically feasible?"
38:10;38:12;"You'd think they'd be cannibalizing each other."
38:12;38:13;"Bro, this is a great idea for a movie."
38:13;38:15;"There's, like, a Starbucks across the street from a Starbucks."
38:15;38:18;"This is like a modern-day Rip Van Winkle."
38:18;38:21;"Jake goes to take a nap at Home Depot."
38:21;38:22;"I like it."
38:22;38:23;"Jake takes a nap."
38:23;38:24;"Sleeping in my minivan."
38:24;38:30;"Jake pulls into Home Depot and do some shopping, but he decides maybe he'll catch a few Z's first."
38:30;38:31;"He wakes up."
38:31;38:33;"He slept for 100 years."
38:33;38:36;"There are now four times as many Starbucks in America."
38:36;38:38;"Everything else more or less the same."
38:38;38:46;"The next two hours are Jake just forced to grapple with what it means to live in a country with four times as many Starbucks."
38:46;38:52;"Maybe then you, like, meet a Canadian friend along the way who, like, tells you, like, ""I've been through this, man."""
38:52;39:01;"Or they're like, ""Now there's twice as many Tim Hortons, so now it's 5,000 Canadians per Tim Horton."""
39:01;39:02;"I mean, it's probably on its way."
39:02;39:06;"Canada's just, like, you know, staying way ahead of us with this."
39:06;39:11;"Well, so Seinfeld, are there just, like, very few mom-and-pop donut shops in Canada?"
39:11;39:14;"You know, short answer, yes."
39:14;39:21;"I think that Tim Hortons is dominating just based on pure anecdotal what I've seen compared to, like, L.A."
39:21;39:25;"Yeah, I think they've given those mom-and-pops a run for their money."
39:25;39:35;"From, like, a capitalistic evolutionary standpoint, Tim Hortons is maybe the most successful species that could completely take over an ecosystem and dominate it."
39:35;39:38;"Because, like, McDonald's is very popular, but there's Burger King."
39:38;39:40;"There's plenty of independent burger places."
39:40;39:44;"Every town has, like, a weird, you know, little burger spot."
39:44;39:49;"They just found that sweet spot between, like, middle--"
39:49;39:51;"Because it's not--"
39:51;39:52;"Big fish in a small pond."
39:52;39:53;"Yeah, yeah."
39:53;39:55;"And then there's coffee time and country style."
39:55;39:59;"How much coffee and donuts are Canadians consuming?"
39:59;40:02;"Not to mention iced cappuccinos and Timbits."
50:53;50:57;"So Jake, we're about to get a call from Jeff Weiss."
50:57;50:58;"Cool."
50:58;51:00;"He's the editor of the Passion of the Weiss blog,"
51:00;51:02;"host of the Shots Fired podcast,"
51:02;51:05;"and former music columnist at LA Weekly."
51:05;51:09;"And he started the #BoycottLAWeekly Twitter movement."
51:09;51:11;"You know what's going on with LA Weekly?"
51:11;51:13;"I'm sure Jeff will explain."
51:13;51:15;"It kind of ties in with some of the stuff we were talking about."
51:15;51:17;"I mean, they got bought."
51:17;51:18;"By a bigger--"
51:18;51:21;"A company called Seminole Media,"
51:21;51:25;"which was formed to buy LA Weekly."
51:25;51:28;"And they were sort of like not revealing their identity."
51:28;51:31;"And everyone was like, ""Who bought LA Weekly?"""
51:31;51:34;"And then they revealed themselves, and it's like--"
51:34;51:36;"Jeff will fill us in, but basically it's like"
51:36;51:38;"some Orange County dudes that are into like,"
51:38;51:41;"you know, right of center economic policy"
51:41;51:42;"and that kind of stuff."
51:42;51:45;"So this is like a beloved local alternative weekly paper"
51:45;51:46;"getting bought by--"
51:46;51:49;"Some dudes that are like not copacetic with that worldview."
51:49;51:52;"And then they came in and they fired all of the editors,"
51:52;51:53;"or like whatever, Nike."
51:53;51:55;"And I wanted to keep Jeff because he was one of the"
51:55;51:57;"more popular columnists, and he was basically like,"
51:57;51:59;"""Fuck this. I'm not--"
51:59;52:00;"Oh, was he? Okay."
52:00;52:01;"So that's my understanding."
52:01;52:02;"Let's get him on the phone."
52:02;52:06;"Now, let's go into the Time Crisis Hotline."
52:06;52:09;"[phone ringing]"
52:09;52:10;"Hey, Jeff."
52:10;52:11;"Hey, what's going on?"
52:11;52:13;"Welcome to Time Crisis, Jan with Ezra and Jake."
52:13;52:14;"Hey, Jeff."
52:14;52:18;"So we know that all this stuff with LA Weekly getting bought"
52:18;52:20;"and you leaving kicked off a while ago."
52:20;52:22;"Our show is every two weeks,"
52:22;52:25;"so we're not exactly the most up-to-date"
52:25;52:26;"in terms of news and stuff."
52:26;52:27;"Don't worry."
52:27;52:29;"It's still a dystopian future that we inhabit."
52:29;52:30;"Deeply."
52:30;52:31;"Yeah."
52:31;52:32;"That part's not going away."
52:32;52:33;"You know, totally."
52:33;52:36;"So we're both vaguely familiar with the situation,"
52:36;52:39;"but why don't you just walk us through it kind of quickly,"
52:39;52:42;"give us just your take about essentially what happened."
52:42;52:43;"Okay."
52:43;52:45;"Well, basically, LA Weekly had been on the block for a while."
52:45;52:46;"Everyone kind of knew it was going to be sold."
52:46;52:48;"Everyone sort of expected layoffs."
52:48;52:50;"Suddenly it gets bought by a mystery buyer."
52:50;52:52;"No one has any idea who this mystery buyer is."
52:52;52:53;"They don't show up to the office."
52:53;52:54;"They don't send an email."
52:54;52:55;"They're not like--"
52:55;52:57;"No telegram, no Morse code, nothing."
52:57;53:00;"So one day they sneak into the office over Thanksgiving."
53:00;53:02;"And so people knew something was up,"
53:02;53:03;"and then the next day they were like--"
53:03;53:05;"right afterwards, the editor-- or the publisher, excuse me--"
53:05;53:08;"gets an email saying that everyone has basically been fired."
53:08;53:10;"Every single editor, the publisher,"
53:10;53:12;"half the advertising staff."
53:12;53:14;"No one still even knows who owned the paper."
53:14;53:17;"Finally, under pressure, it was revealed who they were,"
53:17;53:21;"which was basically a consortium created strictly for the purchase"
53:21;53:23;"of a bunch of Orange County Republicans"
53:23;53:25;"and, you know, nefarious think tanks."
53:25;53:27;"One of the men-- the front man, if you will--"
53:27;53:29;"is a man named Brian Kaye,"
53:29;53:32;"who was formerly the vice president of the Claremont Institute,"
53:32;53:35;"which New York Review Books just had an article called ""Trump's Brains."""
53:35;53:38;"And pretty much since then, they've been just failing miserably."
53:38;53:41;"For the last two months, we've been boycotting them."
53:41;53:43;"We shut down one of their events."
53:43;53:45;"And ultimately, the politics aside,"
53:45;53:47;"it's just kind of a disgrace to journalism in the city of LA."
53:47;53:49;"Why do you think these guys bought it?"
53:49;53:52;"Because, like, from an outsider point of view,"
53:52;53:56;"you hear about a bunch of, like, crazy right-wingers"
53:56;53:59;"buying a left-leaning local publication,"
53:59;54:03;"and you assume that this is a nefarious plot"
54:03;54:05;"to take over the culture."
54:05;54:08;"But on the same time, it sounds like such an idiotic plot,"
54:08;54:12;"as if somebody-- a local LA person who reads LA Weekly,"
54:12;54:14;"and then one day, there's, like--"
54:14;54:16;"like, what is it? There's gonna be a headline that's like,"
54:16;54:18;"""Trump's cool. Condos are awesome."""
54:18;54:20;"""Actually, Trump's sick. We were wrong."""
54:20;54:22;"Like, it sounds like such a-- it sounds so weird"
54:22;54:24;"that they targeted LA Weekly."
54:24;54:26;"Or did they just think it was a good way for them to make money?"
54:26;54:28;"I think it's threefold."
54:28;54:30;"The first is, yeah, I do think it was ideological."
54:30;54:32;"I think they wanted to, uh-- you know,"
54:32;54:33;"they'd have a little pro-Weed coverage."
54:33;54:35;"They'd be like, ""Hey, guys, we like to toke."""
54:35;54:37;"And then they'd kind of also undermine it, you know,"
54:37;54:39;"with anti-teachers union stuff,"
54:39;54:41;"the huge Democratic donors,"
54:41;54:43;"attacking far-left-- you know, supporting far-left candidates"
54:43;54:45;"to kind of split the Democratic vote."
54:45;54:47;"Maybe you take down a Maxine Waters with a scandal piece."
54:47;54:49;"Kind of the different ways that you can kind of"
54:49;54:51;"bring someone down kind of in an insidious way."
54:51;54:54;"I think, too, there was obviously the Weed element of it."
54:54;54:56;"One of the guys was a Weed lawyer."
54:56;54:58;"You know, libertarians have always been historically--"
54:58;55:00;"these guys are-- they're such geniuses"
55:00;55:02;"that they're pro-Weed but also pro-private prison,"
55:02;55:05;"which-- it's a different story altogether."
55:05;55:07;"But, yeah, they're just kind of-- there was that."
55:07;55:09;"And I also think they also just were kind of"
55:09;55:12;"idiot FireFast bros that were like, ""Let's be legends."""
55:12;55:14;"-Right. -And, uh, I think that's part of it."
55:14;55:17;"And, yeah, it's great, 'cause they will be--"
55:17;55:20;"every time anyone Googles their name for the rest of their life,"
55:20;55:22;"they'll be reminded of the fact that they're basically"
55:22;55:24;"the journalism equivalent of the FireFast."
55:24;55:26;"# What would I be without my baby?"
55:26;55:29;"# To throw the law on my break, man"
55:29;55:32;"# And I don't want to go crazy"
55:32;55:34;"# But every thug needs a lady"
55:34;55:37;"# Never feel like you and I been more than together"
55:37;55:39;"# Inseparable, mutual stain over pleasure"
55:39;55:42;"# For that, you forever be a part of me"
55:42;55:45;"# Mind, body, soul, ain't no I in we, baby #"
55:45;55:47;"Can you explain to the listeners a little bit, like,"
55:47;55:50;"especially for the younger listeners"
55:50;55:53;"who probably didn't grow up, like, picking up"
55:53;55:55;"the physical copy of an AllWeekly"
55:55;55:59;"and they maybe have a sense that they live in a liberal area"
55:59;56:02;"or that they encounter a lot of citizen journalists"
56:02;56:04;"on Medium or Twitter, can you explain a little bit"
56:04;56:07;"why they need to understand that they shouldn't be lulled"
56:07;56:10;"into complacency and why it still is really important"
56:10;56:12;"that there's journalists getting paid"
56:12;56:15;"at local independent publications?"
56:15;56:16;"Well, it's an interesting thing, right?"
56:16;56:19;"So, like, Donald Trump announced that they're removing protections"
56:19;56:22;"of Salvadorans, right? So even if you're not Salvadoran,"
56:22;56:24;"like, there's such a prominent place in LA,"
56:24;56:26;"like, you know, tens of thousands of Salvadorans"
56:26;56:29;"in Los Angeles, principally in this district called Pico Union."
56:29;56:32;"And, like, it's important for that community to be covered"
56:32;56:34;"and to see how it's affecting your neighbours."
56:34;56:37;"It's important to kind of, whether it's..."
56:37;56:39;"or whether it's, like, local arts and culture."
56:39;56:41;"Like, you know, there's a big arts thing going on right now."
56:41;56:43;"The biggest arts, like, a symposium"
56:43;56:46;"or, like, a weekly festival thing going on in LA,"
56:46;56:47;"nobody's even covering it for LA Weekly."
56:47;56:49;"And so you want to be an artist or creative type."
56:49;56:52;"Like, you're not going to get your album covered."
56:52;56:54;"You're not going to get your gallery exhibition covered."
56:54;56:56;"You know, and it's like, at a certain point,"
56:56;56:57;"you're going to look around, and it's like,"
56:57;56:58;"yes, citizen journalists are cool,"
56:58;57:00;"but these legacy publications have value,"
57:00;57:02;"and that's why these people are buying them."
57:02;57:05;"They know. It's why the Koch brothers are buying Time."
57:05;57:07;"You know, it's not because Time's going to be that profitable."
57:07;57:08;"It's because Time is Time."
57:08;57:09;"LA Weekly is LA Weekly."
57:09;57:12;"The Village Voice is still going to be the paper"
57:12;57:15;"that had, you know, Lester Banks and Robert Christown"
57:15;57:16;"dating back to Norman Mailer."
57:16;57:19;"It has these legacies, you know, and they know that,"
57:19;57:20;"and they're preying upon that."
57:20;57:24;"And ultimately, like, people just need to get paid to, like, do..."
57:24;57:26;"'Cause it is... Journalism is a public good."
57:26;57:27;"I think one of the most important things"
57:27;57:29;"that we've seen out of this kind of, like, fraud environment"
57:29;57:32;"is journalists and the media, like, kind of conveying to people"
57:32;57:34;"that, yeah, like, there's a lot of [bleep] bull[bleep]"
57:34;57:35;"There's a lot of clickbait. It does suck."
57:35;57:37;"There's a lot of terrible journalism."
57:37;57:39;"Conversely, like, Alabama was..."
57:39;57:41;"Literally now has a Democratic senator"
57:41;57:44;"because The Washington Post were such good journalists, you know?"
57:44;57:49;"And you can't only rely on Jeff Bezos to save the day"
57:49;57:50;"or, you know, The New York Times."
57:50;57:52;"It's really important that, you know,"
57:52;57:54;"you have to get a start somewhere, and there's a lot of writers"
57:54;57:56;"and, you know, people like, you know,"
57:56;57:57;"maybe you want to be a page designer."
57:57;57:59;"I spoke to a kid the other day, and he's like,"
57:59;58:00;"""You know, I'm a designer."
58:00;58:02;"I always wanted to do, like, an LA Weekly cover."""
58:02;58:05;"And those things are kind of being shut down."
58:05;58:08;"- Right, and I think also a lot of us non-journalists"
58:08;58:13;"take for granted that we think that we're getting information"
58:13;58:14;"from a million sources,"
58:14;58:17;"but BuzzFeed and HuffPo and all these places,"
58:17;58:22;"they take and repackage stories that you should pray to God"
58:22;58:24;"came from a real journalistic source."
58:24;58:25;"- Totally."
58:25;58:27;"- And I know it's so basic to say,"
58:27;58:29;"but it's like a place like LA Weekly"
58:29;58:32;"has editors and journalistic standards."
58:32;58:33;"- Totally."
58:33;58:35;"- And even when you're talking about taking down Roy Moore,"
58:35;58:37;"you can't half-ass that. - Totally."
58:37;58:38;"- If you lack journalistic ethics,"
58:38;58:40;"you're going to get murdered by the opposition."
58:40;58:43;"- And when they tried, they did that Project Veritas thing, right?"
58:43;58:44;"- Right."
58:44;58:45;"- What's interesting is Project Veritas,"
58:45;58:47;"which tried to take down The Washington Post"
58:47;58:49;"by going to them with a fake accuser,"
58:49;58:53;"the irony of that is Project Veritas is run by James O'Keefe."
58:53;58:55;"James O'Keefe is from the Claremont Institute,"
58:55;58:58;"which is the same organization that produced Brian Kayette,"
58:58;59:00;"who is now the LA Weekly guy."
59:00;59:02;"And it's also--I mean, I don't know."
59:02;59:05;"I think about--when I was--I used to do LA Weekly cover--"
59:05;59:07;"I did a bunch of LA Weekly covers."
59:07;59:09;"I always think back to one of the first ones I did,"
59:09;59:11;"which was--I don't know if you're familiar with the Jerkin movement."
59:11;59:14;"It was a big thing in 2008, 2009."
59:14;59:16;"I spent a month shadowing these guys."
59:16;59:19;"We made a little mini doc in the early days of YouTube."
59:19;59:22;"And I wrote this 5,000-word cover story."
59:22;59:26;"And it's weird, 'cause that movement produced a YG,"
59:26;59:28;"and I have the first interview with YG from that,"
59:28;59:30;"and it produced DJ Mustard."
59:30;59:33;"So it's like even these stories that really start micro,"
59:33;59:35;"and you might think, ""Oh, it's a little fat,"""
59:35;59:37;"it's preserved kind of for eternity."
59:37;59:38;"That's our history."
59:38;59:39;"It's always that trite thing,"
59:39;59:41;"like journalism is the first draft of history."
59:41;59:42;"But that's true."
59:42;59:44;"What happens when we don't have a history?"
59:44;59:47;"Then we are susceptible to these ideologues"
59:47;59:51;"and these craven men who are just basically trying to exploit it"
59:51;59:53;"and kind of tell us what the history is."
59:53;59:57;"So for the listeners, they should research the Boycott LA Weekly movement,"
59:57;59:58;"keep that in mind."
59:58;59:59;"Totally."
59:59;01:00:01;"And what else can they do?"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"Are there places that you--"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"and even just for local stuff,"
01:00:05;01:00:07;"what do you think they can do as an alternative?"
01:00:07;01:00:10;"Well, I mean, it's a combination of things."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"I would say it's--"
01:00:11;01:00:13;"obviously I'm biased on my website, Passion in the West,"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"but there's a website called LA Taco that's really good."
01:00:15;01:00:18;"There's Rosecrans Avenue is a really good local blog."
01:00:18;01:00:20;"I mean, to be honest with you,"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"there aren't that many alternatives right now,"
01:00:22;01:00:23;"and that's kind of what's terrifying."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"The city of almost 4 million people,"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"and it's only the LA Times,"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"and the LA Times is the LA Times."
01:00:29;01:00:30;"LA Mag is LA Mag."
01:00:30;01:00:32;"Those are specific demographics."
01:00:32;01:00:33;"For stuff that's like--"
01:00:33;01:00:37;"I mean, it's like a cultural hub, and that is gone."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"So I think everyone's going to have to--"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"first of all, just boycott LA Weekly,"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"if you see it, throw it in the garbage or pour water on it."
01:00:43;01:00:46;"But second of all, I think we're all going to have to band together"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"and support the people that are doing cool things"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"and also start doing cool things ourselves,"
01:00:50;01:00:54;"whether it is a zine, whether it is a small blog that people--"
01:00:54;01:00:55;"you know, it's like--I don't know."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"You probably remember when Tumblr was kind of a thing,"
01:00:57;01:00:59;"and that was a cool little moment"
01:00:59;01:01:00;"because people were writing weird things."
01:01:00;01:01:03;"And I first started my blog in the early blog era"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"when you'd go to a website and you'd be like,"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"""I don't know any of these rappers."
01:01:06;01:01:07;"I don't know any of these bands."
01:01:07;01:01:10;"I don't know this obscure rap record from '93 Houston,"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"but it's incredible."
01:01:12;01:01:14;"We just need to do cool things for the sake of doing cool things,"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"and obviously we need to get paid too."""
01:01:16;01:01:17;"So I mean, I don't know."
01:01:17;01:01:20;"I think the future is a combination of that."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"I think journalists are going to have to--"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"and writers and artists in general are going to have to"
01:01:23;01:01:26;"sell themselves to their fans in a way that we probably don't like to,"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"but I guess that's just the reality of it."
01:01:28;01:01:31;"And I think, like--but I do think it's not hopeless."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"I appreciate you guys shining a light on this"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"because it's important for everyone to kind of know."
01:01:35;01:01:36;"No, we want people to know."
01:01:36;01:01:39;"I mean, on this show, we--like, literally just before,"
01:01:39;01:01:42;"we were talking about Tim Horton's the brand in Canada,"
01:01:42;01:01:44;"which is very ubiquitous in Canada."
01:01:44;01:01:45;"It's a good donut."
01:01:46;01:01:50;"There have been--as some franchise owners have been punishing their employees"
01:01:50;01:01:53;"because the minimum wage went up,"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"and there's been, like, a whole hubbub about that."
01:01:55;01:01:57;"We were kind of talking about how even Tim Horton's this, like,"
01:01:57;01:02:00;"seemingly, you know, super Canadian thing."
01:02:00;01:02:02;"When you, like, follow the money at this point,"
01:02:02;01:02:07;"it's owned by a giant company that's mostly owned by a Brazilian investment firm."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"Totally."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"Not that there's anything wrong with Brazilians,"
01:02:10;01:02:13;"but just that these things that dominate our landscape--"
01:02:13;01:02:14;"and it's just like a local paper,"
01:02:14;01:02:19;"just like your local donut shop, your local place you get a sandwich."
01:02:19;01:02:22;"You, at the very least, to be a remotely responsible citizen,"
01:02:22;01:02:25;"have to be cognizant of who owns it and what their interests are."
01:02:25;01:02:26;"Totally."
01:02:26;01:02:28;"It's, like, amazing how quickly we start to feel hopeless"
01:02:28;01:02:32;"that we'll never really be able to put our finger on where this [bleep] comes from."
01:02:32;01:02:33;"Yeah."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"But you got to if you want to be healthy."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"Yeah."
01:02:35;01:02:38;"No, it was wild because I was thinking about all these community newspapers"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"that this guy came from and they're all owned by this conglomeration,"
01:02:40;01:02:41;"and you follow the trail."
01:02:41;01:02:44;"At the end of it, it's like a 75-year-old hedge fund billionaire"
01:02:44;01:02:47;"that lives in New York City that's just spending, like, $60 million a year"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"at Palm Beach Real Estate just because he can."
01:02:49;01:02:50;"You know what I mean?"
01:02:50;01:02:51;"You're like, ""That's horrible."
01:02:51;01:02:53;"You're literally destroying local news."""
01:02:53;01:02:55;"You can buy another, like, Palm Beach mansion,"
01:02:55;01:03:00;"which is just heinous, and I hate pink like that unless Cameron's wearing it."
01:03:00;01:03:03;"[laughs]"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"All right."
01:03:04;01:03:05;"Well, thanks for calling, Jeff,"
01:03:05;01:03:08;"and everybody check out Passion of the Wise and the Shots Fired podcast."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"We appreciate you calling in, man."
01:03:09;01:03:10;"Yeah, awesome."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"Good luck with everything."
01:03:11;01:03:12;"I appreciate it."
01:03:12;01:03:13;"All right, have a good one."
