00:13;00:19;"some came back without arms and legs to defend American democracy."
00:19;00:24;"Football, unless you're a player, is a spectator sport."

03:20;03:22;">> Very exciting."
03:22;03:25;">> I know you got something to say about it, I got something to say about it."
03:25;03:27;"But we're gonna be talking to a lot of interesting people."

03:46;03:48;"to take back the White House."
03:48;03:51;"We'll also be talking to Louis Calderon, who's the arts, culture, and"
03:51;03:53;"youth vote manager on the Bernie Sanders campaign."
03:53;03:56;"We'll get a little bit of Hillary, a little bit of Bernie."
03:56;03:59;"And furthermore, we'll be talking to Dan Schnur,"
03:59;04:02;"the director of the Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics at USC."
04:02;04:06;"And this is a dude who worked for John McCain and now is an independent."
04:06;04:10;"And then about halfway through the show, I'm gonna fly to Iowa, straight up."
04:10;04:13;">> Just gonna walk the studio over."
04:13;04:18;">> I'm gonna take the whole studio to Iowa, because I'm gonna go campaign for"

04:21;04:22;"And I'm gonna meet up with Jake Longstreth,"
04:22;04:26;"our West Coast correspondent, and see what's good over there."
04:26;04:29;"You ready to dive in to the nasty, disgusting world of politics?"
04:29;04:30;">> Let's get dirty."
04:40;05:07;"the time they wanna take your place the back stabbers."
05:07;05:11;"back stabbers."
05:11;05:15;"All the time they wanna take your place the back stabbers."
05:15;05:21;"All you fellas who have someone and you really care."
05:21;05:24;"Yeah, yeah."
05:24;05:27;"Then it's all on your fellas."
05:27;05:29;"You better beware."
05:29;05:32;"Yeah, yeah."
05:32;05:35;"Somebody's out to get your lady."
05:35;05:40;"A few of your buddies, they sure look shady."
05:40;05:43;"Blades of long bloods tied in their fist."
05:43;05:48;"Aiming straight at your back and I don't think they'll miss."
05:48;05:51;"What they do, they smile in your face."
05:51;05:55;"All the time they wanna take your place the back stabbers."
05:55;05:57;"Back stabbers."
05:57;06:02;"Keep getting all these visits from my friends."
06:02;06:05;"Yeah, what they doing to me."
06:05;06:13;"They come to my house again and again and again and again, yeah."
06:13;06:16;"So are they there to see my woman?"
06:16;06:21;"I don't even behold her, they just keep on coming."
06:21;06:24;"What can I do to get on the right track?"
06:24;06:28;"I wish they'd take some of these knives out my back."
06:28;06:32;"What they do, they smile in your face."
06:32;06:36;"All the time they wanna take your place the back stabbers."
06:36;06:38;"Back stabbers."
06:38;06:44;"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah."
06:44;06:48;"Low down, dirty."
06:52;06:55;"What they do, they smile in your face."
06:55;07:00;"Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes."
07:00;07:03;"They smile in your face."
07:03;07:06;"I know me."
07:06;07:09;"Low down, dirty lies."
07:09;07:11;"They smile in your face."
07:11;07:13;"Down, down, down."
07:13;07:16;"Down, down, down, down, down, down, down."
07:16;07:19;"That was the OJs with Back Stabbers."
07:19;07:22;"We're kicking off our Politricks special."
07:22;07:24;"So Asher, we're from similar backgrounds."
07:24;07:32;"We were raised by so-called liberal Jewish people in the so-called Garden State."
07:32;07:36;"I imagine your parents like mine and our grandparents too."
07:36;07:40;"All classic, kind of New York Democrats."
07:40;07:45;"Definitely, my parents were hippies growing up, lived in Woodstock for a while."
07:45;07:48;"They got serious Democrat roots."
07:48;07:52;"The generation before that, everyone in my family generation before are hardcore Republican."
07:52;07:53;"Really?"
07:53;07:54;"Yeah."
07:54;07:55;"Israel man."
07:55;07:56;"Oh."
07:56;07:57;"They don't flinch."
07:57;07:58;"Your grandparents?"
07:58;07:59;"Yeah."
07:59;08:04;"All grandparents, great aunts, great uncles, they just, they don't even look at the news."
08:04;08:06;"They got one position, that's it."
08:06;08:09;"In Politricks, those are called one issue voters."
08:09;08:10;"Uh-huh."
08:10;08:14;"I don't know what they're called in Yiddish, but that's what they are."
08:14;08:16;"In Yiddish, that's called a shonda."
08:16;08:17;"A shonda."
08:17;08:20;"You only vote for one thing, ignoring the poor working people of this country."
08:20;08:21;"Sure."
08:21;08:22;"Now, what about you, Ash?"
08:22;08:23;"Do you consider yourself a Democrat?"
08:23;08:24;"Are you a registered Democrat?"
08:24;08:26;"I am a registered Democrat."
08:26;08:32;"I've moved almost every two years for the last eight years."
08:32;08:38;"So, it's a real pain in the ass to change my voting registration every single time, but I do it."
08:38;08:42;"I'm going to come clean about this on the radio because I don't want to give anybody the wrong impression."
08:42;08:45;"But I am, this is a classic example."
08:45;08:46;"You registered as a Republican?"
08:46;08:48;"No, of course I'm not registered as a Republican."
08:48;08:55;"No disrespect to people registered as a Republican, outside some maybe disrespectful policies, but I am registered as an independent."
08:55;08:58;"This is an example of, I remember last time I was voting for Obama."
08:58;09:01;"I came so close to voting for the Green Party."
09:01;09:04;"I remember I was standing in line, downtown New York City."
09:04;09:06;"The Winklevai were in front of me."
09:06;09:07;"Oh, yeah?"
09:07;09:08;"You know those dudes?"
09:08;09:09;"Literally in front of you in line?"
09:09;09:10;"Literally."
09:10;09:12;"There were these two big-ass twins, and I was like, ""Who are these dudes?"""
09:12;09:14;"And I was like, ""These guys are so funny."""
09:14;09:15;"And then it just struck me."
09:15;09:19;"I was literally just waiting behind them for 15 minutes, and I was like, ""I probably should have done a selfie or something."""
09:19;09:21;"I imagine those guys are Republicans."
09:21;09:23;"Do they go into the booth together?"
09:23;09:25;"That's a great question."
09:25;09:27;"Yeah, I think they, you know--"
09:27;09:28;"They count as two votes or one vote?"
09:28;09:29;"Twins only get one vote."
09:29;09:30;"Yeah."
09:30;09:37;"But anyway, I remember I was so close to wanting to vote for the Green Party, and I remember I had somebody yell in my face before and said, ""You idiot. You take away votes."""
09:37;09:39;"And this is in New York, which is blue states, and you idiot."
09:39;09:48;"How can you even suggest that you might not get Obama re-elected when you've got Romney who's going to take away reproductive rights from women, all this stuff?"
09:48;09:50;"And I was like, ""Man, man."""
09:50;09:51;"It's a very convincing argument."
09:51;09:58;"So I voted for Obama, but my little protest was marking myself as an independent, and I'm still down as an independent."
09:58;10:02;"So then when I was like, ""Oh, I'm excited. I want to vote for Bernie. That's who I'm supporting."""
10:02;10:10;"And then I had my team, you know, ""Oh, just make sure--just let me know if I can get it, you know, mail it in if I'm not in New York."""
10:10;10:12;"And they said, ""Ezra, you're registered as an independent."""
10:12;10:14;"And I was like, ""All right, register me as a Democrat then."""
10:14;10:16;"And they said, ""It's too late. You have to do that in October."""
10:16;10:17;"Oh, damn."
10:17;10:19;"So I can't vote in the primary, but that's why--"
10:19;10:21;"You still have time for the general election?"
10:21;10:24;"Oh, yeah. Well, in the general election, I just go vote. It doesn't matter who you register."
10:24;10:25;"Yeah, I guess that's true."
10:25;10:26;"So I messed up really bad."
10:26;10:33;"That's why I feel even more need that I need to go support Bernie, go to Iowa, help get out the vote."
10:33;10:39;"Anybody out there, please, if you are registered as a Democrat, don't make the mistakes that I made in my life."
10:39;10:41;"Unless you vote for Bloomberg."
10:41;10:43;"Oh, God. Don't even get me started on that."
10:43;10:51;"But the main thing that I'm wondering is because, like, probably a lot of people, like our parents who are Democrats, are really divided about Bernie versus Hillary."
10:51;10:52;"Yeah."
10:52;10:53;"It's like they're neck and neck."
10:53;10:55;"Here's the thing. Like, your parents probably--Hillary?"
10:55;11:06;"Definitely Hillary. I think they're--you know, I think they're--what they think of when they think of the political golden age is, like, first term Bill Clinton,
early mid-90s."
11:06;11:10;"And they're just trying to get--claw their way back to that."
11:10;11:11;"90s weren't even that good."
11:11;11:12;"I mean--"
11:12;11:13;"90s are overrated."
11:13;11:14;"I don't want it."
11:14;11:15;"They're staples."
11:15;11:16;"You said it."
11:16;11:17;"So is Bill Clinton."
11:17;11:24;"The one thing that I don't get is, like, look, am I crazy that I think somebody who voted for the Iraq War should probably not be president?"
11:24;11:27;"Am I too extreme?"
11:27;11:32;"But then, I don't know, does that make you a one-issue voter at the end of the day?"
11:32;11:34;"No, I have some other issues. We'll be talking about them."
11:34;11:35;"Okay."
11:35;11:39;"This is just my feeling. I think it's great that Hillary apologized for the Iraq War."
11:39;11:40;"She said she was sorry."
11:40;11:46;"But I do think that's a mistake so cataclysmic that maybe it should prevent you from being president."
11:46;11:52;"I mean, let's keep it real. I'm sure she thought she was doing the right thing when she made that vote."
11:52;11:53;"Right."
11:53;11:58;"Yeah, I don't want to turn into a one-issue voter like your grandparents. Rest in peace."
11:58;11:59;"Blessed be their memory."
11:59;12:02;"But-- and I also don't want to be--"
12:02;12:04;"What about your parents?"
12:04;12:05;"My mom said she's leaning towards Bernie."
12:05;12:10;"Bernie, I got to sit down with my dad. I got to sit down with my dad and ask him more."
12:10;12:13;"But in the meantime, we are going to be talking to somebody very shortly."
12:13;12:20;"So we want to say, Hillary, even though we don't want to vote for you, we really respect that you apologized for voting for the Iraq War."
12:20;12:24;"So we're dedicating this song to you. Here's Justin Bieber with ""Sorry."""
12:25;12:28;"Ooh, ooh"
12:28;12:33;"You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty"
12:33;12:38;"You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies"
12:38;12:43;"I hope I don't run out of time 'cause I won't call a referee"
12:43;12:47;"'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness"
12:47;12:53;"I know you know that I make those mistakes maybe once or twice"
12:53;12:57;"But by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times"
12:57;13:02;"So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem all myself tonight"
13:02;13:06;"'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances"
13:06;13:12;"Is it too late now to say sorry?"
13:12;13:16;"'Cause I'm missing more than just your body"
13:16;13:21;"Is it too late now to say sorry?"
13:21;13:24;"Yeah, I know that I let you down"
13:24;13:27;"Is it too late to say sorry now?"
13:27;13:32;"Sorry, yeah"
13:37;13:41;"Sorry, yeah"
13:41;13:44;"I know that I let you down"
13:44;13:47;"Is it too late to say sorry now?"
13:47;13:50;"Ooh, ooh"
13:50;13:55;"I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to"
13:55;14:00;"But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two"
14:00;14:05;"I'll go, I'll go, and then you go, you go out and spill the truth"
14:05;14:09;"Can we both say the words and forget this?"
14:09;14:14;"Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?"
14:14;14:18;"'Cause I'm missing more than just your body"
14:18;14:23;"Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?"
14:23;14:27;"Yeah, I know that I let you down"
14:27;14:30;"Is it too late to say sorry now?"
14:30;14:33;"I'm not just trying to get you back on me"
14:33;14:37;"'Cause I'm missing more than just your body"
14:37;14:42;"Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?"
14:43;14:46;"Yeah, I know that I let you down"
14:46;14:49;"Is it too late to say sorry now?"
14:49;14:51;"Ooh, ooh"
14:51;14:54;"Sorry, yeah"
14:54;14:56;"Ooh, ooh"
14:56;14:59;"Sorry, yeah"
14:59;15:01;"Ooh, ooh"
15:01;15:03;"Sorry, yeah"
15:03;15:05;"I know that I let you down"
15:05;15:08;"Is it too late to say sorry now?"
15:08;15:10;"Ooh, ooh"
15:10;15:13;"Sorry, yeah"
15:13;15:15;"Ooh, ooh"
15:15;15:18;"Sorry, yeah"
15:18;15:20;"Ooh, ooh"
15:20;15:22;"Sorry, yeah"
15:22;15:24;"I know that I let you down"
15:24;15:27;"Is it too late to say sorry now?"
15:27;15:35;"So you know, Asher, I have a theory that one of the reasons that Bernie is doing even remotely well"
15:35;15:38;"when you consider that he's this dude from a small state, Vermont"
15:38;15:39;"Uh-huh"
15:39;15:42;"Only recently essentially joined the Democratic Party"
15:42;15:45;"He was an independent senator and a member of the House for years before that"
15:45;15:49;"I think part of the reason that people like him is because we're in the internet era"
15:49;15:54;"And you can, it's very easy to go back and see what he's been saying for a long time"
15:54;15:58;"So you know, again, I'm not saying that there's not valid critiques of Bernie"
15:58;16:02;"But one thing that I think people like about him is that there's a level of consistency"
16:02;16:03;"Sure"
16:03;16:05;"That we're not that used to from a lot of politicians"
16:05;16:06;"Uh-huh"
16:06;16:09;"Maybe I, you know, you accused me before, I don't want to be a one-issue voter"
16:09;16:13;"But I do think that, you know, U.S. foreign policy is very important"
16:13;16:16;"And one thing that's interesting about him is like we're talking about like the Iraq War"
16:16;16:18;"Who voted for it, who voted against it"
16:18;16:20;"What were people saying when they had to make a difficult decision"
16:20;16:26;"One thing I like about Bernie is we can go back and kind of see what he's been saying"
16:26;16:27;"As long as he's been a politician"
16:27;16:34;"So as far as U.S. policy goes, this is him on the floor of the House, 1991, voting on the Iraq War"
16:34;16:39;"This vote that we are about to take is not just a vote for war and peace"
16:39;16:44;"But it is a vote for the future direction of America for years to come"
16:44;16:47;"Can we create a different future for this country?"
16:47;16:52;"A future in which this nation leads the world in the quality of our healthcare system"
16:52;16:54;"The quality of our educational system"
16:54;16:57;"The quality of our housing and our general standard of living"
16:57;17:00;"The quality of our respect for the environment"
17:00;17:03;"And the quality of the culture which we produce"
17:03;17:05;"So that's Bernie, 1991"
17:05;17:08;"Whatever you say, if you say he's too radical, he's not radical enough"
17:08;17:09;"There's valid points to be made"
17:09;17:11;"You've got to give him props for consistency"
17:11;17:12;"Crush that"
17:12;17:15;"1991, on the floor of the House"
17:15;17:19;"We're basically about to go bomb Saddam"
17:19;17:21;"Who was our ally a few years earlier"
17:21;17:24;"This dude's down there basically saying"
17:24;17:26;"How is it possible we're still using violence?"
17:26;17:29;"Couldn't we not try something different in this situation?"
17:29;17:34;"Is the future of America going to be one where we're known as a violent, aggressive nation to the world?"
17:34;17:37;"Or could we focus on things like, like you said, healthcare?"
17:37;17:40;"So this is a dude, he's been saying this for 25 years"
17:40;17:41;"Yeah, it's impressive"
17:41;17:42;"That's impressive"
17:42;17:44;"Again, maybe he's not radical enough"
17:44;17:45;"I don't know"
17:45;17:49;"I think it's just sad that that's considered radical"
17:49;17:50;"I think it's..."
17:50;17:53;"I mean, we're talking about running for president"
17:53;17:55;"So the scale is very different"
17:55;17:56;"It's very skewed"
17:56;18:01;"And obviously, on the Republican side, radicals stretch so much farther out"
18:01;18:04;"Because they are so much louder"
18:04;18:06;"And they get so much more coverage"
18:06;18:11;"And it's so much more possible for a Republican with that kind of narrative"
18:11;18:13;"To at least make it far in the primaries, if not win it"
18:13;18:19;"But on the Democrat side, it's a party of contemplation"
18:19;18:22;"And weighing every possible option"
18:22;18:29;"And not necessarily taking a very strong hardline stance on something"
18:29;18:35;"So I think it's hard to include people who are more radical in that kind of environment"
18:35;18:37;"Because they usually do have very..."
18:37;18:39;"Oh, look who just came in"
18:39;18:40;"His desk bot"
18:40;18:42;"What's really good"
18:42;18:44;"Thanks for joining us, man"
18:44;18:45;"This is our Politrix special"
18:45;18:47;"I love Politrix"
18:47;18:48;"I hope so"
18:48;18:52;"We're going to be grilling you pretty hard about your candidate choice, Donald Trump"
18:52;18:54;"Yeah, Trump for Prez"
18:54;18:56;"But a little more on that later"
18:56;19:00;"In the meantime, why don't you pick a song for our listeners to listen to"
19:00;19:02;"Before we talk to McKay Coppins"
19:02;19:05;"Should it relate to Politrix?"

27:22;27:24;"We don't do that very often on Time Crisis."
27:24;27:25;"His name is McKay Coppins."
27:25;27:27;"He's a senior writer for BuzzFeed."
27:27;27:29;"He's written about the Republicans"
27:29;27:30;"and I think he's a Hillary supporter."
27:30;27:31;"We're going to find out."
27:31;27:32;"Alright, you ready?"
27:32;27:33;"Let's do it."
27:33;27:34;"Let's get it."
27:34;27:39;"[phone ringing]"
27:39;27:40;"Hello?"
27:40;27:41;"Hey."
27:41;27:43;"McKay Coppins, what's up?"
27:43;27:44;"Hey, how's it going?"
27:44;27:45;"How you doing, man?"
27:45;27:47;"You're on the line with me, Cousin Asher, and Death Spot."
27:47;27:49;"Thanks for calling in, man."
27:49;27:50;"Hey, thanks for having me."
27:50;27:53;"So, I'm about to go to Iowa."
27:53;27:55;"I'm going to go campaign for Bernie,"
27:55;27:57;"see what's up out there."
27:57;27:59;"When are you coming out?"
27:59;28:01;"I'm going to be there this afternoon."
28:01;28:02;"Oh, wow."
28:02;28:04;"Sidebar, that means Sunday,"
28:04;28:07;"because we're pre-recording this."
28:07;28:09;"I'm going to be there this afternoon."
28:09;28:11;"So, are you in Iowa?"
28:11;28:13;"Yeah, I'm in Des Moines right now."
28:13;28:15;"So, what, you're just reporting there for BuzzFeed?"
28:15;28:18;"Yeah, I'm going around to the different rallies,"
28:18;28:19;"talking to people."
28:19;28:21;"I stood in line for, like, two hours"
28:21;28:23;"to get into a Trump rally the other night"
28:23;28:25;"and didn't get in."
28:25;28:28;"Are you a Trump supporter?"
28:28;28:30;"No, no."
28:30;28:31;"Why not?"
28:31;28:33;"But there are a lot of Trump supporters."
28:33;28:35;"Donald Trump kind of scares me, to be honest."
28:35;28:38;"I actually have, like, a whole weird, like,"
28:38;28:41;"bat story with Trump, but he, like, personally hates me."
28:41;28:44;"Shouldn't a president be scared?"
28:44;28:46;"He's not..."
28:46;28:49;"But I will say, you're a Bernie guy."
28:49;28:51;"I was in line, and there were, like,"
28:51;28:55;"40 Bernie supporters, like, from the college campus nearby"
28:55;28:57;"who were out there protesting,"
28:57;28:58;"and they were out there for hours,"
28:58;29:00;"and it was freezing cold."
29:00;29:02;"Wait, these were Bernie supporters..."
29:02;29:04;"Bernie supporters protesting Trump?"
29:04;29:06;"Yeah, yeah, protesting Trump,"
29:06;29:08;"and, like, yelling at the Trump supporters"
29:08;29:10;"who were lined up trying to get in."
29:10;29:11;"Not bad."
29:11;29:15;"So, McKay, you're a political writer for BuzzFeed,"
29:15;29:17;"but you're also a voter."
29:17;29:19;"Are you allowed to have, like, your own opinion,"
29:19;29:21;"or you got to keep it real neutral?"
29:21;29:23;"Well, we try to stay neutral."
29:23;29:25;"I mean, I, you know, I'll vote at some point,"
29:25;29:28;"but I don't know, like, covering politics as a profession"
29:28;29:31;"makes you really cynical about everything,"
29:31;29:33;"so it gets to the point where it's, like,"
29:33;29:36;"hard to be excited to vote for anyone."
29:36;29:38;"So, right now, are you not excited about anybody?"
29:38;29:40;"Hillary or Bernie?"
29:40;29:43;"No, geez, I'm not really excited about anyone."
29:43;29:45;"I will say, Bernie, like,"
29:45;29:49;"whatever you think of his, like, policy positions,"
29:49;29:53;"like, he is at least, like, one of very few candidates"
29:53;29:54;"on either side of the aisle"
29:54;29:56;"who actually seems like they're honestly"
29:56;29:58;"telling voters what they believe,"
29:58;30:00;"which is, like, good--"
30:00;30:02;"which is, I mean, now having covered politics"
30:02;30:05;"for a little while, like, that's extremely rare."
30:05;30:07;"So, I mean, I give him, like, a lot of credit."
30:07;30:09;"He kind of reminds me, not in--"
30:09;30:10;"obviously not in policy at all,"
30:10;30:13;"but in his whole style,"
30:13;30:15;"he reminds me of Ron Paul in 2012,"
30:15;30:17;"the libertarian, who is, like,"
30:17;30:20;"kind of, like, an anti-charismatic figure"
30:20;30:22;"that, like, was kind of, like--"
30:22;30:24;"seems kind of kooky and was definitely"
30:24;30:26;"outside the normal political mainstream,"
30:26;30:29;"but his supporters were, like, so diehard,"
30:29;30:31;"and they would do anything for him,"
30:31;30:33;"and Sanders reminds me a lot of that,"
30:33;30:36;"although he obviously is getting a lot further"
30:36;30:38;"in his race than Ron Paul ever did."
30:38;30:41;"- You're calling--you're calling him a dork, essentially."
30:41;30:43;"You're calling Bernie Sanders a dork."
30:43;30:46;"- He's, like, an unkempt, like, grandpa."
30:46;30:48;"- Right. - But, like--"
30:48;30:50;"I don't know, like, people like grandpas."
30:50;30:51;"- Oh, yeah, that's true."
30:51;30:52;"You know, but I've been thinking something,"
30:52;30:53;"McKay, for a while."
30:53;30:56;"I feel like things were really cool"
30:56;30:59;"from roughly, like, 2009 to 2014."
30:59;31:03;"Things were really cool, but now, in 2016,"
31:03;31:06;"the guy who wrote ""Hamilton"" is cooler than Kanye."
31:06;31:09;"So clearly something's changing in the American psyche."
31:09;31:10;"- Yeah. - You know what I mean?"
31:10;31:13;"Like, people don't like cool stuff anymore."
31:13;31:14;"- I don't know what ""Hamilton"" is."
31:14;31:17;"- Yeah, well, that's--I mean, I want to hear--"
31:17;31:18;"'cause you're a big Bernie supporter."
31:18;31:20;"Have you campaigned for him before,"
31:20;31:21;"volunteered or anything for him?"
31:21;31:22;"- No, this is my first time,"
31:22;31:25;"and I'm a little bit nervous, 'cause, you know, I don't--"
31:25;31:28;"I'm like you. I'm jaded about politics,"
31:28;31:30;"so I don't want to get too excited about this guy."
31:30;31:31;"I think he should win,"
31:31;31:33;"but I don't want to put my whole reputation on the line"
31:33;31:36;"and say, like, you know, I don't know him."
31:36;31:37;"- Have you talked to him at all yet?"
31:37;31:39;"- No, not yet. - Oh, man."
31:39;31:40;"I want to hear what you think of him"
31:40;31:41;"when you actually meet him."
31:41;31:46;"I mean, like, the big argument that Clinton supporters make"
31:46;31:49;"is that she's more electable, right,"
31:49;31:50;"in a general election. - Right."
31:50;31:53;"- Like, if you want to stop a Republican from winning,"
31:53;31:55;"Hillary Clinton is the one to nominate,"
31:55;31:58;"because she's, you know, she's much more, like,"
31:58;31:59;"in the political mainstream."
31:59;32:01;"She has a lot of experience."
32:01;32:03;"She's worked with Obama for a long time."
32:03;32:04;"- Isn't that loser talk?"
32:04;32:06;"- But, like, that doesn't make people excited."
32:06;32:08;"- I know. - Like, no one gets excited"
32:08;32:10;"for, like, a candidate that is, like,"
32:10;32:11;"more electable than the other guy."
32:11;32:14;"- That's basically saying that America's so bad,"
32:14;32:16;"just let it stay the same. - Yeah."
32:16;32:17;"- Just don't let it get any worse."
32:17;32:19;"- It's just like, well, yeah, like, vote for somebody"
32:19;32:23;"who's, like, slightly less bad than the other person,"
32:23;32:24;"you know? I don't know."
32:24;32:25;"- You don't think that voting for the Iraq War"
32:25;32:28;"should disqualify you from being president?"
32:28;32:32;"- Well, I mean, this is the thing, like,"
32:32;32:35;"Hillary Clinton is, like, that's, like,"
32:35;32:36;"probably the worst."
32:36;32:39;"If there was one thing she could take back"
32:39;32:41;"in her entire career, it's probably that vote."
32:41;32:44;"- You know how, in March Madness,"
32:44;32:46;"if you lose one game, you're out?"
32:46;32:47;"- [laughs]"
32:47;32:49;"You think the Iraq War is, like, the one--"
32:49;32:51;"is, like, she's already done?"
32:51;32:53;"- I'm just saying, like, as soon as people"
32:53;32:54;"start describing that as, like,"
32:54;32:56;"if you messed up on the Iraq War, oops."
32:56;32:59;"But--but-- - Are you scared about the idea"
32:59;33:02;"that, like, if you nominate Bernie Sanders"
33:02;33:04;"and then Donald Trump could actually beat him?"
33:04;33:06;"Like, does that-- does that factor"
33:06;33:08;"into your decision-making at all?"
33:08;33:11;"- Uh, well, no, McKay, I ain't never scared."
33:11;33:13;"[laughter]"
33:13;33:16;"- Um, so you're scared of Bernie and Trump."
33:16;33:17;"- I'm not--I'm not scared of it."
33:17;33:19;"I'm just wondering, like, are you--you know,"
33:19;33:22;"does the electability thing hold any, like, sway"
33:22;33:23;"for you?"
33:23;33:26;"- Well, as far as I know, it's a lot of hype"
33:26;33:28;"to say that Hillary's more electable than Bernie."
33:28;33:30;"- Yeah. - I'm not getting any real--"
33:30;33:32;"I think--I think that's a--that's a lie."
33:32;33:34;"- Actually--and that's-- that actually is a good point,"
33:34;33:36;"because that was, like, the argument for months"
33:36;33:38;"and months that the Hillary camp was putting out,"
33:38;33:41;"but actually, more recent polls show Sanders"
33:41;33:44;"doing better than Clinton in theoretical"
33:44;33:46;"national campaign match-ups."
33:46;33:48;"- It's the same thing that happened to Obama."
33:48;33:49;"Same situation."
33:49;33:50;"They're, like, they're not more electable"
33:50;33:52;"until they are more electable, and then it's"
33:52;33:53;"a different story."
33:53;33:55;"- Good thing people don't even know who he is yet."
33:55;33:56;"- Yeah. - I just feel like, you know,"
33:56;33:58;"if you're, like, in a relationship,"
33:58;33:59;"and the other person says, like,"
33:59;34:01;"""You'll never find somebody better than me,"""
34:01;34:02;"that's the exact moment that you should"
34:02;34:03;"break up with them."
34:03;34:04;"[laughter]"
34:04;34:05;"- That's true."
34:05;34:07;"- So Hillary is, like--is, like,"
34:07;34:09;"threatening you with that, like--"
34:09;34:10;"- Well, I'm not even saying Hillary, period--"
34:10;34:12;"like, Hillary as a person, 'cause, like,"
34:12;34:14;"we know it's something much bigger"
34:14;34:15;"than all these people."
34:15;34:17;"It's the campaign. It's the supporters."
34:17;34:18;"[sighs]"
34:18;34:19;"I don't know. We're gonna--"
34:19;34:20;"we're gonna go do some research, man."
34:20;34:21;"We're just getting started here."
34:21;34:23;"But thank you very much for calling in, McKay."
34:23;34:24;"- Yeah."
34:24;34:26;"- However, because you implied that"
34:26;34:28;"the three of us were scared,"
34:28;34:31;"we're gonna dedicate ""Bone Crusher."""
34:31;34:33;"I ain't never scared to you, okay?"
34:33;34:34;"'Cause I want you to go tell everybody"
34:34;34:35;"now we're never scared."
34:35;34:37;"But thank you for calling in, man."
34:37;34:38;"Have a good one. - All right, thanks."
34:38;34:39;"See you."

35:16;35:26;"♪"
39:36;39:48;"♪"
39:48;39:50;"- That was ""Bone Crusher"" with ""Never Scared,"""
39:50;39:54;"featuring T.I. and, as Despot pointed out, Killer Mike,"
39:54;39:56;"who I think at this point is maybe one of the most vocal"
39:56;39:58;"Bernie Sanders supporters."
39:58;39:59;"- The ultimate Bernie bro."
39:59;40:01;"- He may be his ultimate Bernie bro."
40:01;40:03;"- Yeah, I would say so."
40:03;40:05;"- We gotta talk a little bit first"
40:05;40:06;"about what is a Bernie bro."
40:06;40:07;"- I don't know."
40:07;40:10;"- I think Bernie bro is a way to people that's like"
40:10;40:12;"an annoying guy who loves Bernie"
40:12;40:14;"and just, like, sticks up for him at all costs."
40:14;40:15;"- Mm."
40:15;40:17;"- I don't think that's fair to say to Killer Mike."
40:17;40:18;"Killer Mike is reasonable."
40:18;40:19;"- No, it's not. - Yeah."
40:19;40:21;"- More about dedication than anything else."
40:21;40:24;"It's about just being focused on it,"
40:24;40:27;"making it your goal for whatever period of time."
40:27;40:29;"You're just all about Bernie all the time."
40:29;40:31;"- And I think also when you call somebody a bro,"
40:31;40:33;"it implies they're like a bit of a dummy."
40:33;40:35;"- Yeah, possibly."
40:35;40:36;"But I wouldn't say that about--"
40:36;40:37;"- Can you be a smart bro?"
40:37;40:40;"- Um, I think you could maybe be a smart bro."
40:40;40:42;"- You have some finance bros, pretty smart."
40:42;40:44;"- Mm, are they smart, though?"
40:44;40:45;"- Different kind of smart."
40:45;40:46;"- Yeah, just-- - Book smart."
40:46;40:48;"- Crafty, I think. - Maybe not street smart."
40:48;40:49;"- Crafty."
40:49;40:51;"- Crafty, yeah, craftiness is different."
40:51;40:52;"You could be a crafty bro."
40:52;40:54;"- Yeah. - Look at that crafty bro."
40:54;40:56;"- Yeah, they got, like, friendship bracelets on."
40:56;40:57;"- [laughs]"
40:57;40:59;"Livestrong bracelets."
40:59;41:01;"- People still wear those?"
41:01;41:02;"- I don't know."
41:02;41:03;"- Bros do."
41:03;41:05;"- You're listening to..."
41:05;41:06;"[electronic music]"
41:06;41:09;"""Time Crisis"" on BeatOne."
41:09;41:11;"- You know, living here in New York City,"
41:11;41:15;"we're surrounded by a lot of, uh, cuckoo liberals."
41:15;41:16;"- Mm."
41:16;41:19;"- I don't have a lot of Republicans in my family."
41:19;41:21;"I don't have enough Republican friends."
41:21;41:23;"I do think it's a problem, 'cause I think it's important"
41:23;41:25;"to know people of all different leanings."
41:25;41:27;"But the guy we're about to talk to, Dan Schnur,"
41:27;41:30;"is a former Republican, and he teaches at USC."
41:30;41:33;"He's the director of the Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics,"
41:33;41:34;"where he works to motivate students"
41:34;41:36;"to become involved in politics, government,"
41:36;41:37;"and public service."
41:37;41:40;"- Both crazy last names, Schnur and Unruh."
41:40;41:42;"- And this guy has some serious--"
41:42;41:43;"has a very serious resume."
41:43;41:46;"He was director of communications in 2000"
41:46;41:48;"for John McCain, and he spent five years"
41:48;41:49;"as chief media spokesman"
41:49;41:51;"for California Governor Pete Wilson."
41:51;41:53;"I have no memories of Pete Wilson."
41:53;41:54;"- Me neither."
41:54;41:55;"- I like his name, though. - No, no."
41:55;41:57;"- Sounds like a-- just like a nice guy."
41:57;41:59;"- Sounds like a catcher."
41:59;42:00;"- Chip off the old guy."
42:00;42:02;"- Yeah, I thought he was a baseball player for a second."
42:02;42:07;"I think he was a pinch hitter for the Dodgers."
42:07;42:10;"Very popular, and then became governor."
42:10;42:11;"- Yeah, I believe that."
42:11;42:13;"- For about five years. - That'll do it."
42:13;42:14;"- Let's get Dan Schnur on the phone"
42:14;42:17;"and talk about Republicanism."
42:17;42:18;"[line trilling]"
42:18;42:22;"[line trilling]"
42:22;42:24;"- Hello? - Hey, Dan, how you doing?"
42:24;42:26;"- Good, is this Ezra? - Yeah, this is Ezra,"
42:26;42:28;"and I'm here with Cousin Asher and Despot."
42:28;42:29;"What's up? - Hi."
42:29;42:31;"- Hey, guys. - Hey, thanks for calling in, man."
42:31;42:32;"- Happy to."
42:32;42:34;"- So tell us about yourself."
42:34;42:36;"So you--it seems like you've been involved"
42:36;42:39;"in some major Republican campaigns."
42:39;42:40;"Are you a Republican?"
42:40;42:44;"- Well, I was involved in campaigns a long time ago."
42:44;42:47;"My last one was John McCain's campaign"
42:47;42:50;"for president in 2000, but several years ago,"
42:50;42:52;"I changed my party registration"
42:52;42:54;"from Republican to Independent,"
42:54;42:56;"and so at this point, I teach,"
42:56;42:59;"and I run the Institute of Politics at USC"
42:59;43:04;"and try to offer less partisan analysis on politics"
43:04;43:07;"rather than fighting on behalf of one side or the other."
43:07;43:08;"- Right."
43:08;43:12;"So you're talking basically to the youth of America,"
43:12;43:14;"future leaders, all the time."
43:14;43:18;"Like, one question that I have, 'cause maybe this is just us"
43:18;43:20;"over here in liberal New York City"
43:20;43:21;"as relatively young people,"
43:21;43:25;"but are there still gonna be Republicans in the future?"
43:25;43:27;"'Cause every year, they always tell us"
43:27;43:30;"that all the kids like Obama, all the kids like Bernie."
43:30;43:33;"So where are things trending?"
43:33;43:36;"- There's no question that not just in terms of age,"
43:36;43:38;"but in terms of other demographics,"
43:38;43:39;"mainly ethnic heritage,"
43:39;43:43;"that those trend lines favor the Democrats very, very strongly."
43:43;43:47;"Hispanic American voters, Asian American voters,"
43:47;43:49;"lean Democratic in overwhelming numbers."
43:49;43:52;"There's no question that Republicans are gonna have"
43:52;43:54;"to make a pretty serious adjustment"
43:54;43:56;"in order to remain competitive."
43:56;43:58;"That said, it's worth taking a step back,"
43:58;44:01;"'cause here I sit in deep blue Los Angeles"
44:01;44:02;"on the other end of the country."
44:02;44:06;"In between you and me, Ezra, there's a lot of red."
44:06;44:08;"Republicans hold the majority in Congress"
44:08;44:10;"and in the U.S. Senate."
44:10;44:14;"They control more than 30 of the governor's offices"
44:14;44:16;"in the country, and they control"
44:16;44:19;"an overwhelming majority of the state legislators."
44:19;44:21;"So while the long-term trends you're talking about"
44:21;44:22;"are exactly right,"
44:22;44:25;"and I think what you and I see in our respective cities"
44:25;44:27;"are indicators in that regard,"
44:27;44:32;"in the meantime, this country's much more balanced"
44:32;44:34;"than it appears to be."
44:34;44:35;"- Right, when you put it that way,"
44:35;44:37;"the Republicans are killing it."
44:37;44:40;"- It's been a while since they've elected a president,"
44:40;44:42;"but those kind of things, as you guys know,"
44:42;44:44;"tend to go in cycles."
44:44;44:47;"But the same thing happens here as it does in New York City,"
44:47;44:50;"as it does in Texas or in Utah."
44:50;44:52;"You spend your time around people"
44:52;44:54;"who believe in the same things you do,"
44:54;44:56;"and it's easy to forget that there's a lot of people"
44:56;44:57;"out there who don't."
44:57;44:59;"- Yeah, no, that's very right."
44:59;45:01;"So it's interesting that you switched your party affiliation"
45:01;45:03;"to independent, not Democrat."
45:03;45:05;"I was talking earlier that I'm also registered"
45:05;45:08;"as an independent, which means that I totally messed up"
45:08;45:10;"and I can't vote in the Democratic primary"
45:10;45:13;"for the person I'd like to see president, which is Bernie."
45:13;45:16;"But one thing that I'm curious to get your take on"
45:16;45:17;"that I think is cool about Bernie"
45:17;45:19;"is that he's not exactly a Democrat,"
45:19;45:20;"is he?"
45:20;45:22;"- No, he's not anywhere near a Democrat."
45:22;45:24;"- A lot of people, like, you know,"
45:24;45:26;"that's just how our goofball country works."
45:26;45:27;"Everybody's hearing about him now"
45:27;45:29;"just because it's time to elect a president."
45:29;45:31;"But this dude was the only independent"
45:31;45:34;"in the Senate and the House for a while, right?"
45:34;45:36;"- Yeah, that's absolutely right."
45:36;45:38;"And I think that gets to another, I think,"
45:38;45:40;"really interesting question, particularly about young voters."
45:40;45:43;"You guys are a lot more equipped to talk to this than I am."
45:43;45:46;"You know, when I grew up, there were three TV networks."
45:46;45:48;"There were five buttons on my car radio."
45:48;45:50;"And there were two political parties."
45:50;45:53;"So now I have an infinite number of entertainment"
45:53;45:56;"and information options available to me."
45:56;45:58;"But I still only have two political parties."
45:58;46:01;"And for my students, for the millennial generation"
46:01;46:03;"that's used to having all those choices"
46:03;46:05;"in every other aspect of their life,"
46:05;46:07;"being forced into a binary decision mode in politics"
46:07;46:10;"is something that's fundamentally unacceptable to them."
46:10;46:12;"- Yeah, I mean, I feel like we as a society"
46:12;46:15;"are right on the cusp of, like, moving past the gender binary,"
46:15;46:17;"but we're still gonna end up with this, like,"
46:17;46:19;"crazy Democratic-Republican binary."
46:19;46:21;"- Unless Michael Bloomberg runs for president."
46:21;46:23;"- Oh, God."
46:23;46:26;"- But at the same time, it seems like if you look at everyone"
46:26;46:28;"who's been popular for the last, you know,"
46:28;46:30;"the last nine months or so,"
46:30;46:32;"the one trend that you can mark to all of them"
46:32;46:34;"is that they speak their minds."
46:34;46:37;"They don't really fall so clearly in a party."
46:37;46:42;"They're more in a party because the system works that way."
46:42;46:44;"But it seems that people--"
46:44;46:47;"we are at a point where people are really attracted to"
46:47;46:50;"not just voting red or voting blue,"
46:50;46:52;"but just voting for people"
46:52;46:54;"whose opinions they agree with personally."
46:54;46:56;"- Right, like crazy Trump."
46:56;46:58;"- That's a perfect example."
46:58;47:00;"- Is Trump even really a Republican, Dan?"
47:00;47:02;"- You know, he's no more of a Republican"
47:02;47:04;"than Bernie Sanders is a Democrat."
47:04;47:06;"They both have issues in which they overlap"
47:06;47:08;"with those two parties, but they--"
47:08;47:11;"I think you'd agree with this on Sanders, no question."
47:11;47:13;"He goes well beyond part of the orthodoxy"
47:13;47:15;"on any number of things."
47:15;47:17;"Trump's the same way on the other side."
47:17;47:19;"Here's my question for you guys."
47:19;47:22;"Which one of the two of them, Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump,"
47:22;47:24;"would be more annoyed that we're comparing them to each other?"
47:24;47:26;"- Hmm, well, one thing I like about Bernie,"
47:26;47:28;"he always says, ""My good friend Donald Trump."""
47:28;47:30;"See, that's the question I have."
47:30;47:33;"Is it possible that Sanders actually could appeal"
47:33;47:37;"to a lot of independent people who kind of hate the Democrats?"
47:37;47:41;"Because in the way that both of these guys are kind of brazen,"
47:41;47:44;"they both have a type of consistency"
47:44;47:47;"that maybe there is a type of independent voter"
47:47;47:49;"who would never in a million years vote for Hillary,"
47:49;47:51;"but maybe would vote for Bernie,"
47:51;47:53;"because there's something about Bernie"
47:53;47:55;"that feels fundamentally different."
47:55;47:57;"Maybe that person--I wonder if there's people"
47:57;47:59;"who would be on the fence--like, this sounds crazy,"
47:59;48:02;"but let's say it turns into a Sanders-Trump election."
48:02;48:05;"We get a real Queens versus Brooklyn subway series."
48:05;48:08;"Like, that seems like the most black and white thing ever, right?"
48:08;48:11;"A lefty guy and a kind of right-wing guy"
48:11;48:13;"saying outrageous racist things."
48:13;48:15;"But is it possible that you're still gonna have"
48:15;48:18;"that dude in Ohio, that dude in Florida,"
48:18;48:20;"who looks at Sanders and Trump and says,"
48:20;48:22;"""Man, I don't know."""
48:22;48:24;"Is there still that--is that guy gonna be there?"
48:24;48:28;"That confused voter who's like, ""Sanders-Trump, Sanders--"""
48:28;48:30;"Like, they seem so different, right?"
48:30;48:33;"But are they weirdly have some common ground?"
48:33;48:35;"- Well, they do have some common ground,"
48:35;48:37;"and I'd say it's not the kind of common ground"
48:37;48:40;"you find in the traditional binary breaking point"
48:40;48:42;"between the two parties."
48:42;48:44;"But I'd argue that what they have in common"
48:44;48:48;"is that both of them represent an awful lot of people"
48:48;48:50;"who feel like they're being overlooked"
48:50;48:52;"by the current political process."
48:52;48:54;"And one person might think the way you remedy that"
48:54;48:56;"is by having government run health care."
48:56;48:58;"The other person might think you do that"
48:58;49:00;"by building a wall on the Mexico border."
49:00;49:03;"But either way, they're upset that nobody in Washington"
49:03;49:05;"seems to be listening to them."
49:05;49:08;"Even if Sanders and Trump's remedies"
49:08;49:10;"are not what they necessarily agree with,"
49:10;49:13;"they're just glad that someone's diagnosed the problems"
49:13;49:15;"and is giving their frustration some voice."
49:15;49:17;"- Is it possible--so I got one last question for you."
49:17;49:23;"So there's reasons to feel excited about Sanders"
49:23;49:26;"and maybe even in some weird way Trump shaking things up."
49:26;49:29;"But is it possible that for all the shake-ups these guys do,"
49:29;49:33;"if we still end up with Clinton versus Cruz,"
49:33;49:35;"that all of that shake-up was for nothing?"
49:35;49:37;"Or is there gonna be, like, a lasting effect?"
49:37;49:39;"- There can be a lasting effect."
49:39;49:42;"That doesn't mean that there will be, but there can be."
49:42;49:44;"George Will, the conservative commentator,"
49:44;49:47;"says that Barry Goldwater actually won"
49:47;49:49;"the 1964 presidential election."
49:49;49:51;"It just took 16 years."
49:51;49:54;"And what he means by that is that even though Goldwater"
49:54;49:56;"got crushed by Lyndon Johnson,"
49:56;49:58;"he gave birth to a conservative movement"
49:58;50:01;"that 16 years later produced Ronald Reagan as president."
50:01;50:04;"Bill Clinton points to some of the centrist Democrats"
50:04;50:07;"who emerged in the 1970s and '80s,"
50:07;50:10;"people who didn't get elected, people like Senator Gary Hart."
50:10;50:12;"He said, ""I could have never become president"
50:12;50:15;"""if people hadn't taken the first steps forward"
50:15;50:17;"and allowed me to build on them."""
50:17;50:19;"There's a famous saying, saying,"
50:19;50:21;"""We stand on the shoulders of heroes."""
50:21;50:23;"And if you stand up for a candidate you believe in"
50:23;50:25;"who happens to come up short,"
50:25;50:28;"what you can be doing is setting yourself up"
50:28;50:30;"for somebody else who believes in the same things you do"
50:30;50:33;"to stand on your shoulders and elect someone you both believe in"
50:33;50:35;"in 4 years or 8 years or 12 years."
50:35;50:38;"Right, and hopefully also-- and I mean, I'm definitely part of the problem--"
50:38;50:42;"not just wait till the presidential elections to get fired up."
50:42;50:44;"Remember the local elections."
50:44;50:46;"Yeah, you elect people to city council,"
50:46;50:48;"and they go on to be in-state legislators,"
50:48;50:50;"and they go on to run for Congress, and they go on to be president."
50:50;50:52;"Barack Obama was a state senator a long time"
50:52;50:54;"before he gave a speech at the Democratic Convention."
50:54;50:56;"Right, Bernie was mayor of Burlington."
50:56;50:57;"Exactly."
50:57;50:59;"Well, great, Dan. Thanks so much for talking to us, man."
50:59;51:01;"That was very educational."
51:01;51:03;"Definitely. I'm glad we had a chance to talk, guys. I enjoyed it."
51:03;51:04;"Thanks for having me on."
51:04;51:05;"Yeah, thanks a lot, man. Have a good one."
51:05;51:06;"You too. Take care."
57:13;57:17;"That was Kanye featuring Kendrick Lamar with No More Parties in LA."
57:17;57:19;"Alright, Despot, I've been waiting to talk to you, man."
57:19;57:20;"Okay."
57:20;57:21;"We got a lot of stuff to ask you about."
57:21;57:23;"Let's take a quick break from Politrix."
57:23;57:24;"Okay."
57:24;57:26;"To ask you about this past week."
57:26;57:31;"What's going on with Kanye and Wiz?"
57:31;57:35;"Well, I would imagine you know what's going on with Kanye and Wiz,"
57:35;57:36;"because it's big news."
57:36;57:39;"I actually don't. I don't spend a lot of time on the internet."
57:39;57:41;"I mostly read books."
57:41;57:42;"Okay, cool."
57:42;57:43;"Fill me in."
57:43;57:47;"What you missed while you were reading books, presumably about Politrix."
57:47;57:48;"[laughs]"
57:48;57:55;"Well, Kanye changed the title of his album to Waves from Swish,"
57:55;57:59;"which I think Swish was a better title, but that is not really--"
57:59;58:02;"That's just one man's opinion. You just keep that to yourself."
58:02;58:11;"And then Wiz Khalifa, who is also a rapper, took offense to that on behalf of the rapper Max B,"
58:11;58:14;"who is currently incarcerated."
58:14;58:23;"Max B coined the term ""wavy,"" meaning something that is good or cool or wavy."
58:23;58:25;"[laughs]"
58:25;58:26;"Ruffles."
58:26;58:32;"A lot of people credit him with being an innovator of the sing-rapping style."
58:32;58:35;"He is an incredible sing-rapper."
58:35;58:36;"Max B is great."
58:36;58:41;"I would say that I am a wavy baby or a child of the wave."
58:41;58:45;"So I understand Wiz Khalifa's position."
58:45;58:48;"Hold on a second. Max B is from Harlem, right?"
58:48;58:49;"Yes."
58:49;58:53;"Wiz Khalifa is from Pittsburgh. Kanye is from Brentwood."
58:53;58:55;"Or maybe Calabasas."
58:55;58:56;"[laughs]"
58:56;59:01;"So you, as a New York rapper, a child of the wave, wavy baby--"
59:01;59:03;"Wavy baby, if you will."
59:03;59:06;"Before about the Wiz stuff, when you saw that Kanye was calling his album Waves,"
59:06;59:09;"did you immediately think, ""How dare he?"""
59:09;59:16;"No. I mean, wavy is, I think, a much more common and popular term now"
59:16;59:19;"than it was when Max B was not in jail."
59:19;59:24;"And I think Max B is probably a lot more famous than he was before he was in jail."
59:24;59:26;"Right, but he called it Waves, not wavy."
59:26;59:29;"Yeah, you think he was specifically referencing that?"
59:29;59:31;"No, I think it's more--"
59:31;59:33;"Well, that's what I'm saying. I think it's more referencing--"
59:33;59:35;"It is referencing the slang."
59:35;59:36;"Okay."
59:36;59:43;"Which Max B arguably created, but I don't think he necessarily had Max B in mind,"
59:43;59:45;"and he did, and then there was--"
59:45;59:48;"So Wiz Khalifa was like, ""You can't use that. You can't say that."
59:48;59:51;"You're not wavy. Whatever, whatever."""
59:51;59:55;"And then Kanye tweeted, ""Peace to Andre Harrell and Max B,"""
59:55;59:58;"and that wasn't good enough for Wiz Khalifa,"
59:58;01:00:03;"who I think retweeted it and said, ""Yeah, whatever,"" or something like that."
01:00:03;01:00:07;"And then that started this whole big thing, and they went back and forth."
01:00:07;01:00:14;"Kanye did a numbered list of the things that--of Wiz Khalifa's shortcomings, including--"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"It was an abstract list."
01:00:16;01:00:17;"Yeah."
01:00:17;01:00:19;"There were a couple of items there that weren't exactly--"
01:00:19;01:00:22;"But you know what? I felt like what I found was interesting about it,"
01:00:22;01:00:26;"when I did check in just now, is that Kanye was saying all this stuff,"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"saying, ""You wouldn't have a child without me,"""
01:00:28;01:00:31;"talking about the fact that they both had the same girlfriend."
01:00:31;01:00:32;"Yes, he took credit for--"
01:00:32;01:00:33;"He took credit for that."
01:00:33;01:00:36;"He said, ""You let a stripper, what, trick you?"""
01:00:36;01:00:37;"Trap you."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"I mean, Amber Rose is not a stripper anymore."
01:00:40;01:00:44;"It seems a little uncalled for to call her a stripper, and that's also his ex-girlfriend."
01:00:44;01:00:47;"One thing I noticed was, I feel like back in the day,"
01:00:47;01:00:50;"people would have been like--because Kanye did roast him."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"Oh, yeah."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"I mean, he had some lines."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"Yeah. I mean, Kanye--all right."
01:00:55;01:00:58;"In the initial back and forth, I would say Kanye won."
01:00:58;01:01:03;"He had his little misstep where I think he did misunderstand Wiz Khalifa--"
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Saying KK."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"Talking about KK."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"Right."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"He thought it was Kim Kardashian, but he was just talking about weed."
01:01:08;01:01:13;"And then Wiz got to be like, ""You're an old man. You don't understand new slang."""
01:01:13;01:01:15;"So you didn't know what KK meant."
01:01:15;01:01:16;"And then he had to apologize."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"Yeah, that was unfortunate."
01:01:17;01:01:20;"And then Kanye said he ethered him, and he spelled ether wrong."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"He said either."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"Either."
01:01:22;01:01:23;"I.e., eithered you."
01:01:23;01:01:26;"Yeah, he eithered him."
01:01:26;01:01:31;"And then, I mean, of course, maybe the most controversial part of this was when Amber Rose jumped in."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"Right. That was the best part by far."
01:01:33;01:01:36;"And was like, ""You have no one to put fingers in your butt anymore."""
01:01:36;01:01:40;"And everyone was like, ""Oh, Kanye, you like fingers in your butt."""
01:01:40;01:01:42;"But I mean, then--"
01:01:42;01:01:44;"With the finger emoji, too."
01:01:44;01:01:48;"But then you have millions of people being extremely homophobic now."
01:01:48;01:01:53;"And mobilizing as a unit of homophobes, being like,"
01:01:53;01:01:56;"""Kanye, you're not allowed to like a finger in your butt."""
01:01:56;01:01:59;"I personally don't like anything in my butt."
01:01:59;01:02:00;"But some people do."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"You fight for the right."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"I don't have a problem with that, you know?"
01:02:03;01:02:09;"I don't think it is as much of a detriment to Kanye's character as everyone's acting like that."
01:02:09;01:02:11;"He likes fingers in his butt. That's fine."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"Well, certainly not."
01:02:13;01:02:20;"And I think it's a very complicated situation because I think people look to Amber Rose as kind of a feminist icon."
01:02:20;01:02:26;"Because she doesn't take any shit when people try to talk about her being a stripper, about her sexuality."
01:02:26;01:02:28;"So I thought people were a little bit confused."
01:02:28;01:02:31;"Well, if you're a sex-positive person, which is a beautiful thing,"
01:02:31;01:02:37;"why are you going to make fun of Kanye for a wonderful sexual act that you guys did together?"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"Because he dragged her into it."
01:02:39;01:02:41;"She didn't need to be a casualty in that fight."
01:02:41;01:02:45;"And he just dragged her in, made it about her instead of about Wiz."
01:02:45;01:02:46;"Sure."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"He deserves it."
01:02:47;01:02:50;"So I guess you're saying two wrongs make a right, huh?"
01:02:50;01:02:51;"Yeah, you are saying that."
01:02:51;01:02:52;"Yeah."
01:02:52;01:02:55;"On Twitter, two wrongs make a right."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"Okay, maybe on Twitter two wrongs make a right."
01:02:57;01:03:02;"We are Play Porno Music by the Wave guy, Max B."
01:03:02;01:03:03;"Free the Wave."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"Despot, what's your take on Donald Trump?"
01:04:25;01:04:29;"Because we know that you have to support him because you're from Queens."
01:04:29;01:04:33;"And people from Queens have a lot of pride in their borough."
01:04:33;01:04:36;"He's the only mainstream political candidate from Queens."
01:04:36;01:04:37;"So what's your take?"
01:04:37;01:04:44;"I'm glad that a man from Queens was able to become so rich."
01:04:44;01:04:47;"I'm happy for him."
01:04:47;01:04:54;"I'm not so sure about his position on immigrants and immigration and things like that."
01:04:54;01:04:56;"Yeah, you know it's kind of crazy."
01:04:56;01:04:57;"Queens."
01:04:57;01:04:58;"Right, the most."
01:04:58;01:05:02;"The most ethnically diverse place in the world per capita, I believe."
01:05:02;01:05:04;"Highly, highly, highly immigrational."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"Highly immigrational."
01:05:06;01:05:09;"What part of Queens is Donald Trump from though?"
01:05:09;01:05:14;"Probably, if I would have to guess, he's from, let me guess, from Douglaston."
01:05:14;01:05:16;"Oh, he grew up in Jamaica Estates."
01:05:16;01:05:17;"Oh, come on."
01:05:17;01:05:23;"Well, why don't you, for people who don't understand, give us a sense of what Jamaica Estates represents."
01:05:23;01:05:29;"Okay, Jamaica Estates is like a sort of suburban enclave in Jamaica, Queens."
01:05:29;01:05:31;"And there are mansions there."
01:05:31;01:05:33;"There are really nice houses there."
01:05:33;01:05:39;"But of course it is part of Jamaica, which is, you know, Southside Jamaica is like not the best place."
01:05:39;01:05:44;"And I guess a largely African-American community."
01:05:44;01:05:50;"But Jamaica Estates is kind of like, I don't know, sheltered from that."
01:05:50;01:05:55;"So, yeah, I mean, so he grew up fairly affluent then, probably."
01:05:55;01:05:59;"Yeah, I love Donald Trump, in short."
01:05:59;01:06:00;"There was."
01:06:00;01:06:03;"But you know, okay, but Bernie is from Brooklyn."
01:06:03;01:06:10;"If we actually get a Subway series, Brooklyn vs. Queens, Sanders vs. Trump, you're going to have to go with Trump out of Queens loyalty?"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"I guess so, yeah."
01:06:12;01:06:15;"It's a sad thing for me, but yeah, I have to."
01:06:15;01:06:19;"I mean, if the guy from Brooklyn wins, I'm not going to help him win."
01:06:19;01:06:21;"Whatever the cost."
01:06:21;01:06:24;"Yeah, you got to pay the cost to be from Queens."
01:06:24;01:06:25;"That's true."
01:06:25;01:06:31;"Well, I admire your loyalty, even though it probably will result in misery for millions and billions of people."
01:06:31;01:06:32;"All the way to the top."
01:06:32;01:06:37;"Although I do have to say I was walking, I was on Fifth Avenue last night and I walked past Trump Tower."
01:06:37;01:06:45;"And they have this amazing like marble monolith with all the logos of all the different businesses that are inside the building."
01:06:45;01:06:48;"And they're all like Trump gift shop, Trump restaurant."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"And there's one that had this amazing logo."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"It was like all scripted."
01:06:51;01:06:54;"It was like the Trump ice cream soda fountain."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"Really?"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"Yeah."
01:06:56;01:07:01;"And no matter what, I think everyone could agree that the White House could use the Trump ice cream soda fountain."
01:07:01;01:07:02;"Oh, for sure."
01:07:02;01:07:05;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
01:07:07;01:07:10;"One."
01:07:10;01:07:12;"Despot, play us a song."
01:07:12;01:07:20;"OK, let's listen to a song called I Should Be Dead by Zalooper, who is a member of the Bruiser Brigade from Detroit."
01:07:21;01:07:48;"I should be dead, I should be dead, I should be dead, I should be dead, I should be dead, I should be dead, I should be dead, I should be dead, think I ain't dead, I should be
fed, follow my mother, start walking like this, checkin' my ways, I'm ending they days, I should be dead, I should be dead, but they ain't there, fuck with the case, hand
me the face, fuck in the face, checkin' her pulse, she's all dead, and heavy, she should be dead."
01:07:48;01:08:07;"Can't be wet, can't lose my head, can't feel my body, that's dead, and I'm out here shoving an X, Haley is Jenny, Ali is Lyle, and Syleen, all of the shit I did, I should be
dead, fucks in the feed, I should be dead, but before I let it rest, I'm making bread, I'm making bread, she was saying, ""Why you don't have a hand in Trump and the
election?"""

01:12:51;01:12:53;"I wanted to play the Bernie Sanders version,"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"but it's mysteriously vanished from the Internet."
01:12:55;01:12:57;"But I can ask our next guest about that,"
01:12:57;01:13:00;"who is Lewis Calderon, who's the Arts, Culture, and Youth Vote Manager"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"on the Bernie Sanders campaign."
01:13:02;01:13:05;"He's actually the dude helping organize what I'm doing out in Iowa."
01:13:05;01:13:07;"So we're about to talk to him."
01:13:07;01:13:08;"Hey, Lewis?"
01:13:08;01:13:09;"Yes."
01:13:09;01:13:10;"Hey, how you doing, man?"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"Ezra. How are you, man?"
01:13:12;01:13:15;"Good. You're on with me, Cousin Asher, and Desva."
01:13:15;01:13:16;"Thanks for calling in."
01:13:16;01:13:17;"Hey, guys."
01:13:17;01:13:19;"So listen, man, I'm very excited to get out to Iowa."
01:13:19;01:13:21;"I'm going to be there in a few minutes."
01:13:21;01:13:24;"But in the meantime, I just want to know, how's it going out there?"
01:13:24;01:13:27;"How's it looking from the Sanders campaign viewpoint?"
01:13:27;01:13:31;"Okay, from the campaign viewpoint, we're looking good."
01:13:31;01:13:36;"I mean, it's not a gimme by any means at all."
01:13:36;01:13:39;"A poll just came out, pretty significant poll came out,"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"has us up by four points."
01:13:41;01:13:42;"Up by four points."
01:13:42;01:13:45;"You know, they can go up, go down a little bit."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"It's a close race, if you will."
01:13:47;01:13:50;"So it makes it exciting."
01:13:50;01:13:52;"So he's four points above Hillary."
01:13:52;01:13:55;"Yes, yes. Here in Iowa at the moment."
01:13:55;01:14:03;"Okay. So God forbid he doesn't win Iowa tomorrow, does he still have a shot?"
01:14:03;01:14:06;"Yes. It's not instantly over."
01:14:06;01:14:15;"But the next stop is New Hampshire, which we have a commanding lead over Hillary Clinton"
01:14:15;01:14:20;"in something like 20-plus points, I believe, last I checked."
01:14:20;01:14:22;"We've had the lead there for a long time."
01:14:22;01:14:25;"And, again, it depends on what polls you're looking at."
01:14:25;01:14:26;"They go up or down."
01:14:26;01:14:28;"But it's our neighboring state."
01:14:28;01:14:32;"We've done well there for a long time."
01:14:32;01:14:39;"But if we do not win Iowa, I'm sure it will have some sort of effect on the tone"
01:14:39;01:14:41;"or the temperament of what happens in New Hampshire."
01:14:41;01:14:44;"But we don't automatically lose."
01:14:44;01:14:47;"We just go over there and we work hard to win that state."
01:14:47;01:14:48;"The fight goes on."
01:14:48;01:14:53;"So we were just trying to play Bernie's recording from the '80s of ""This Land is Your Land,"""
01:14:53;01:14:54;"but it kind of vanished from the Internet."
01:14:54;01:14:58;"So I want to know, on the campaign, are people familiar with the recording?"
01:14:58;01:15:01;"Of course. I am. I have the tape."
01:15:01;01:15:02;"You have the tape?"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"Are you guys playing it in the campaign office?"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"What are people saying about it?"
01:15:06;01:15:09;"It's not something that is played at the office."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"But some people know."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"I grew up in Burlington."
01:15:13;01:15:15;"I grew up in Burlington in the '80s."
01:15:15;01:15:17;"You were first in line at the tape store."
01:15:17;01:15:20;"Just like Nirvana unplugged and Bernie sanded."
01:15:20;01:15:23;"Yeah, I went to my local record store, Pure Pop, picked it up."
01:15:23;01:15:25;"Hot mixtape."
01:15:25;01:15:29;"I get the impression, because I saw it's not on YouTube anymore."
01:15:29;01:15:33;"It's not stuff like Bernie is trying to be like, ""You know what? People don't need to hear me singing."""
01:15:33;01:15:34;"But I love it."
01:15:34;01:15:35;"It was definitely cool."
01:15:35;01:15:39;"I mean, to me, that shows that Bernie's got his priorities in the right place."
01:15:39;01:15:46;"You know, what that is, what it really actually is about is Bernie's been an advocate,"
01:15:46;01:15:51;"has been committed to music, arts, culture, you know, for a really, really long time."
01:15:51;01:15:57;"He's made a commitment to be a president of the arts."
01:15:57;01:16:04;"Burlington was so cool growing up because as a mayor, they put all these cool programs in place."
01:16:04;01:16:07;"Galleries and after-school programs, teen centers, like that."
01:16:07;01:16:12;"I used to hang out at this teen center and all these hardcore shows would be there."
01:16:12;01:16:14;"It was just a cool town."
01:16:14;01:16:20;"So you could make the case that Bernie Sanders helped the hardcore punk rock community of Vermont."
01:16:20;01:16:23;"Somebody has absolutely made the case for that."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"Like Fugazi would make the case for that."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"Cool. I think it's good to remind people."
01:16:27;01:16:32;"I like that way you're saying that Bernie's somebody who cares about the arts in your hometown of Burlington,"
01:16:32;01:16:36;"did a lot for the arts because I think people are just getting introduced to Bernie,"
01:16:36;01:16:39;"the first thing they think of, oh, yeah, that's that guy who's always yelling about the banks."
01:16:39;01:16:40;"Right?"
01:16:40;01:16:45;"Like a lot of people, if you ask, ""Who do you think goes home and enjoys music and art, Hillary or Bernie?"""
01:16:45;01:16:50;"A lot of people would say, ""Oh, well, Hillary,"" because Bernie, he probably just goes home and yells about the banks."
01:16:50;01:16:52;"He just yells at the banks all day."
01:16:52;01:16:58;"So it's cool to say, to remind people that, of course, Bernie's somebody who cares about the arts"
01:16:58;01:17:03;"and actually has had an impact in people's lives, especially in the hardcore punk community of Burlington."
01:17:03;01:17:06;"Yeah. One third of my job is all about the arts."
01:17:06;01:17:12;"And I just launched, we just launched a show here in Los Angeles at the Heavyweight Gallery."
01:17:12;01:17:14;"It's a touring show."
01:17:14;01:17:21;"We just launched it in L.A., but we have a show moving out to Austin, Boston, and then ending up in New York."
01:17:21;01:17:26;"And the show is called The Art of a Political Revolution, Artists for Bernie Sanders."
01:17:26;01:17:38;"And there's about 35 or so artists from all over the country that created and submitted artwork about the campaign and about the issues."
01:17:38;01:17:40;"And it's a really, really amazing show."
01:17:40;01:17:43;"I mean, it's really, really just beautiful work."
01:17:43;01:17:50;"So, you know, in terms of like, you have like guys like Shepard Fairey and who did some of the Obama stuff,"
01:17:50;01:17:57;"we have Aaron Draplin, we have Kwa, we have like a ton of amazing artists."
01:17:57;01:18:05;"So even on the campaign side, where we are right now in the campaign, on the eve of Iowa, we've launched an art program."
01:18:05;01:18:07;"Yeah, that's amazing. That's great."
01:18:07;01:18:09;"Well, Lewis, I'm looking forward to seeing you in Iowa."
01:18:09;01:18:11;"And thanks so much for calling in."
01:18:11;01:18:14;"Before you go, do you want to pick a song that we can play?"
01:18:14;01:18:19;"Maybe something that reminds you of growing up in Burlington when Bernie was mayor?"
01:18:19;01:18:23;"Waiting Room by Sugati."
01:18:23;01:18:43;"Waiting Room by Sugati."
01:18:43;01:18:58;"Waiting Room by Sugati."
01:18:58;01:19:01;"I am a patient boy."
01:19:01;01:19:04;"I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait."
01:19:04;01:19:09;"My time's the one that's gotta trade."
01:19:09;01:19:14;"Everybody move it, everybody move it, everybody move it, move it, move it, move it."
01:19:14;01:19:18;"Please don't leave me to remain."
01:19:18;01:19:21;"I'm a waiting room, I was a nerd."
01:19:21;01:19:23;"I was a nerd, I was a nerd."

01:19:29;01:19:30;"So why?"
01:19:30;01:19:34;"Because they can't get up."
01:19:34;01:19:37;"Come on and get up."
01:19:37;01:19:59;"Come on and get up."
01:19:59;01:20:01;"But I don't say anybody."
01:20:01;01:20:04;"I'm planning a big surprise."
01:20:04;01:20:09;"I'm gonna fight for what I wanna be."
01:20:09;01:20:11;"And I won't make the same mistake."
01:20:11;01:20:12;"Because I know."
01:20:12;01:20:14;"I'm feeling almost time that way."
01:20:14;01:20:15;"And the function."
01:20:15;01:20:18;"The function is to keep."
01:20:18;01:20:20;"I'm doing a waiting room."
01:20:20;01:20:21;"I was a nerd."
01:20:23;01:20:25;"I was a boy at age."
01:20:25;01:20:28;"Sitting outside of town."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"Everybody's always down."
01:20:30;01:20:31;"So why?"

01:20:37;01:20:38;"I'm planning a waiting room."

01:21:05;01:21:09;"Sitting in the waiting room."
01:21:09;01:21:12;"Because they can't get up."
01:21:12;01:21:14;"That was Fugazi with Waiting Room."
01:21:14;01:21:16;"Well guys, I think we learned a lot."
01:21:16;01:21:19;"We talked to all sorts of polytricical people."
01:21:19;01:21:21;"However, were they tricking us?"
01:21:21;01:21:22;"Yes."
01:21:23;01:21:26;"You think all those people were tricking us?"
01:21:26;01:21:27;"I feel thoroughly tricked."
01:21:27;01:21:29;"Right, but Ash, are you still gonna vote for Bernie?"
01:21:29;01:21:30;"Yeah, I'll vote for Bernie."
01:21:30;01:21:33;"All those people on the phone were speaking with four tongues."
01:21:33;01:21:36;"But Despot, are you still gonna vote for Trump or have you been swayed?"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"Trump for prayers."
01:21:38;01:21:40;"Okay, see that's the thing about polytrics."
01:21:40;01:21:42;"People are very set in their ways."
01:21:42;01:21:43;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:21:43;01:21:44;"Yeah."
01:21:44;01:21:45;"Alright, well listen guys."
01:21:45;01:21:50;"I gotta take off, go to Iowa, see what I can do to help this dude get elected."
01:21:50;01:21:53;"God, I hope he doesn't stab me in the back with polytrics."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"We'll find out."

01:40:27;01:40:30;"Rolling through Iowa City,"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"we just sound checked for the big event."
01:40:32;01:40:34;"We got the Lucas Brothers with us."

01:40:42;01:40:43;"Some people might laugh, most people won't,"
01:40:43;01:40:45;"but we're gonna say some (beep)"
01:40:45;01:40:46;"- Well you gotta tow the line,"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"because this is political,"
01:40:48;01:40:49;"so you can't just say anything."
01:40:49;01:40:52;"- Yeah, you know, we gotta hold some things back."

01:40:58;01:41:00;"- The election's really in your hands."
01:41:00;01:41:00;"- I know."
01:41:00;01:41:02;"That's what I'm scared about."
01:41:02;01:41:04;"We come here and then what if he loses?"
01:41:04;01:41:05;"They might blame us."

01:41:08;01:41:10;"I think we're gonna take him to the next level."
01:41:10;01:41:12;"Maybe he'll make us vice president too."
01:41:12;01:41:14;"- Yeah, normally a vice president can only be one person,"
01:41:14;01:41:15;"unless you're twins."
01:41:15;01:41:16;"- Unless you're twins."
01:41:16;01:41:19;"- William Henry Harrison's vice president was twins."
01:41:19;01:41:20;"(laughing)"
01:41:20;01:41:21;"Which you guys, I feel like,"
01:41:21;01:41:23;"were some of the earliest Bernie supporters."
01:41:23;01:41:25;"- That's right, we were on a bandwagon early."
01:41:25;01:41:26;"- At least the people that I follow on Twitter."
01:41:26;01:41:27;"- That's right."
01:41:27;01:41:29;"We were like 50 weeks in."
01:41:29;01:41:30;"We were following him."
01:41:30;01:41:32;"We loved his name."
01:41:32;01:41:36;"I did this thing on Instagram with Bernie Mac and Bernie."
01:41:36;01:41:38;"I was like, ""Oh, they got the same name."""
01:41:38;01:41:39;"(laughing)"
01:41:39;01:41:40;"Then I started looking at his policies"
01:41:40;01:41:41;"and I was like, ""Oh, he's pretty dope."""
01:41:41;01:41:44;"I was also a communist in college."
01:41:44;01:41:45;"- Communist and socialist."
01:41:45;01:41:46;"- Socialist."
01:41:46;01:41:47;"I was a socialist."
01:41:47;01:41:48;"- You were a communist freshman"
01:41:48;01:41:49;"and then you dialed it back a little bit."
01:41:49;01:41:50;"- Then I became a capitalist."
01:41:50;01:41:52;"- Then you became a capitalist."
01:41:52;01:41:53;"You were like, ""Let's split the difference."""
01:41:53;01:41:54;"- This is the difference."
01:41:54;01:41:56;"Nah, but I love Bernie, man."
01:41:56;01:41:57;"He's cool, man."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"- Are there actually any connections"
01:41:58;01:41:59;"between Bernie Sanders and Bernie Mac?"
01:41:59;01:42:01;"- I mean, we've been doing some research"
01:42:01;01:42:03;"and we haven't found any just yet."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"- Well, Bernie Mac is from Chicago."
01:42:05;01:42:06;"- That's right."
01:42:06;01:42:07;"- Bernie Sanders went to University of Chicago."
01:42:07;01:42:08;"- Ah, there you go."
01:42:08;01:42:09;"- We gotta do some research"
01:42:09;01:42:10;"to see if they were there at the same time."
01:42:10;01:42:11;"- That's right."
01:42:11;01:42:12;"- Was Bernie Mac alive?"
01:42:12;01:42:14;"- He was born around that round."
01:42:14;01:42:15;"- Yeah, he was born in like,"
01:42:15;01:42:17;"when was Bernie Mac born?"
01:42:17;01:42:17;"40, 40?"
01:42:17;01:42:18;"- It's possible."
01:42:18;01:42:20;"- Bernie was born in '60s."
01:42:20;01:42:21;"- Jake, you know when Bernie Sanders went to college?"
01:42:21;01:42:22;"- Early '60s."
01:42:22;01:42:23;"- Early '60s?"
01:42:23;01:42:26;"- '62 he was doing the civil rights stuff."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"- Okay."
01:42:27;01:42:28;"- Okay, so it's very possible"
01:42:28;01:42:30;"that a college-age Bernie Sanders"
01:42:30;01:42:33;"maybe could have held a baby Bernie Mac in his arms."
01:42:33;01:42:35;"So you guys wanna pick a song dedicated to Bernie Mac?"
01:42:35;01:42:38;"Something to remember him by?"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"- You got a song?"
01:42:40;01:42:41;"I mean, ""I Miss My Homies"" by Master P."

01:49:12;01:49:14;"- In Iowa City, Iowa."

01:49:58;01:50:02;"because, you know, we're brothers and we're here for Bernie."
01:50:02;01:50:04;"- Nothing wrong with being brothers."
01:50:04;01:50:05;"- The Lucas brothers were in the van with us as well."
01:50:05;01:50:10;"- Did we determine that that term was derogatory though?"
01:50:10;01:50:11;"- Yeah, definitely."
01:50:11;01:50:13;"- What is the context of the term?"
01:50:13;01:50:14;"What does it mean?"
01:50:14;01:50:16;"- I think it's like from Twitter,"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"people who are getting super aggro,"
01:50:18;01:50:21;"maybe they're expressing their enthusiasm for Bernie"
01:50:21;01:50:25;"more through negativity for Hillary, which is not cool."
01:50:25;01:50:28;"This is about Bernie and his ideas and his vision."
01:50:28;01:50:32;"It's not about why Hillary doesn't have those things."
01:50:32;01:50:37;"- So the Bernie bro thing is sort of like dudes being aggro"
01:50:37;01:50:39;"and shouting people down on Twitter."
01:50:39;01:50:40;"- On Twitter."
01:50:40;01:50:43;"- Right, about the most positive candidate."
01:50:43;01:50:45;"- Demanding that people feel the Bern."
01:50:45;01:50:46;"- It's a chill bro zone."
01:50:46;01:50:49;"It's a chill Bernie bro zone here."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"- The term bro is all inclusive."
01:50:51;01:50:52;"Anyone can be a bro."
01:50:52;01:50:55;"And, you know, there are all sorts of Bernie bros"
01:50:55;01:50:57;"in the house tonight."
01:50:57;01:50:58;"- So Dave and I just stole the mic"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"from Colin, our producer."

01:58:56;01:58:57;"where you play mandolin before?"
01:58:57;01:59:01;"- I believe just the Hurricane Sandy thing we did."
01:59:01;01:59:02;"- Oh, all right."
01:59:02;01:59:03;"Only for good cause."
01:59:03;01:59:05;"- Yes, only for the right cause, yeah."
01:59:05;01:59:08;"- Bernie Sanders and Hurricane Sandy, we come out."
01:59:08;01:59:09;"So that was pretty tight."
01:59:09;01:59:11;"What were some of your highlights of the rally?"
01:59:11;01:59:12;"The Bernie rally?"
01:59:12;01:59:16;"- You know what, I've actually never been to a truly adult."
01:59:16;01:59:18;"I went to Bill Clinton's first inauguration,"
01:59:18;01:59:21;"but that's sort of a different feel."
01:59:21;01:59:22;"Never really been to a rally like this."
01:59:22;01:59:25;"I just thought the general positivity,"
01:59:25;01:59:28;"and I think you sort of said this when you were talking,"
01:59:28;01:59:29;"like the hope was like, you know,"
01:59:29;01:59:31;"that's sort of a cheap word sometimes, but."
01:59:31;01:59:31;"- Yeah."
01:59:31;01:59:33;"- I actually kind of really felt it in the room."
01:59:33;01:59:34;"- No, it was a great vibe."
01:59:34;01:59:35;"Bernie killed it."
01:59:35;01:59:37;"- Oh yeah."
01:59:37;01:59:38;"- We killed it."
01:59:38;01:59:39;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:59:39;01:59:42;"- Cornel West, I forgot that he was gonna be there."
01:59:42;01:59:44;"- That was probably our best introduction."
01:59:44;01:59:45;"- That was a bad, yeah."
01:59:45;01:59:47;"Cornel West introduced us, that was tight."
01:59:47;01:59:49;"And now we're just gonna enjoy Iowa City,"
01:59:49;01:59:53;"and hope that Bernie wins on Monday."
01:59:53;01:59:55;"But you know what, if he doesn't,"
01:59:55;01:59:56;"think the thing we gotta remember,"
01:59:56;01:59:58;"we gotta take his words to heart."
01:59:58;02:00:00;"We gotta make sure that we're--"
02:00:00;02:00:03;"- The politics is not a spectator sport."
02:00:03;02:00:05;"- And it's not just about the presidential election."
02:00:05;02:00:07;"Man, we gotta get some cool people"
02:00:07;02:00:08;"in the House and the Senate."
02:00:08;02:00:10;"It's dire out there."
