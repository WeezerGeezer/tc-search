00:06;00:08;"But the topics have not"
00:08;00:11;"We'll be talking about Herm Jarl"
00:11;00:13;"fish"
00:13;00:16;"Better than Ezra and so much more"
00:16;00:19;"This is a brand new"
00:19;00:24;"TC the first of 21 welcome back to"
00:24;00:28;"Crisis with Ezra Koenig"

00:36;00:38;"They passed me by"
00:39;00:41;"Those great"
00:41;00:43;"I"
01:18;01:20;"Time crisis back once again"
01:20;01:23;"2021 let's do this"
01:23;01:31;"Jake how you doing, man? I'm doing pretty well. I had fun making a Herm Jarl playlist today. That was fun"
01:31;01:37;"How are you another day another dollar man"
01:37;01:45;"Mm-hmm. Just grinding it out. I guess yeah, I guess like most people 2021 just feels like a very arbitrary"
01:47;01:50;"Differentiation between 2020 we're still living in the same moment"
01:50;01:57;"Very little's changed on any fronts, but you know doing my thing trying to get back into some kind of groove"
01:57;02:02;"Working here and there. I'm anxious to hear whatever you're working on. We got some good man"
02:02;02:08;"I'll be happy to play for you. I had a long day in the studio today. Just trying to like come up with new stuff"
02:08;02:13;"You know how it is. It's like you come up with some that you're excited about and then you know"
02:13;02:19;"Eventually, you remember you got to keep looking keep panning for gold out there"
02:19;02:22;"No doubt. So how's the Herm Jarl?"
02:22;02:24;"For people don't remember"
02:24;02:28;"Anybody's not a regular listener. This is your first episode of time crisis"
02:28;02:30;"Maybe you're somebody who last year you heard a lot"
02:30;02:33;"You had a lot of TC heads in your life saying man"
02:33;02:38;"You got to get in with time crisis and you felt like man hundreds of hours worth of content"
02:38;02:43;"I don't know how I could fit in and then maybe for your New Year's resolution was like, you know what?"
02:43;02:45;"I'm just gonna get in"
02:45;02:52;"First episode 2021. I'm getting it might take me a second to kind of catch up with the rhythm"
02:52;02:55;"But I'm not gonna go from the start. I'm just gonna get in 2021"
02:55;03:01;"So we'll try to be helpful in terms of contextualizing things. So Herm Jarl is a is a kind of character"
03:01;03:06;"We created as a combination of Herm and Jarl which are two ways of"
03:06;03:09;"describing that kind of"
03:09;03:14;"90s post grunge singing I associate a lot with Eddie Vedder"
03:14;03:20;"We're gonna have a legendary producer musician Jack and Dino who I think coined the phrase Jarl"
03:20;03:27;"Did he coin it or he popularized it in an influential essay? Well either way, we'll be talking to him about this whole phenomenon"
03:27;03:33;"But Jake you started putting together a Herm Jarl playlist that we're gonna share with the TC community"
03:33;03:37;"I did I crowdsourced to the Twitter audience as well"
03:38;03:41;"Got some good questions. What's like track one on the playlist?"
03:41;03:49;"Track one is a little bit weird. It's called the witch of Westmoreland by this Canadian folk musician Stan Rogers"
03:49;03:54;"He's like a Eastern Canadian folk musician who died in a plane crash in the 80s"
03:54;03:57;"He it's kind of like it kind of like a Gordon Lightfoot vibe or something"
03:57;04:02;"But I was like wait, did you have a famous song about a ship? Yes"
04:03;04:08;"Okay, I've heard of this dude. Anyway, I thought of him today when I was listening to all this like deep baritone"
04:08;04:12;"Yeah, kind of singing and it has enormous"
04:12;04:17;"Nostalgic significance for me and I listened to the song literally like eight times today"
04:17;04:25;"So you're tracing the not only the genre of Herm Jarl, but also the roots. Well, yeah, it's called the playlist"
04:25;04:26;"I made is called Herm Jarl origins"
04:26;04:34;"So I wanted to have everything be released before the first Pearl Jam album 10. Mm-hmm, which was released in like"
04:34;04:40;"August or September of 91. I think mm-hmm. I got Green River by Creedence Clearwater"
04:40;04:47;"Yeah, take me back down. Oh, yeah, Fogarty is super proto her. Yeah, I"
04:47;04:50;"Put two different who songs on there"
04:51;04:58;"Interesting. I know better is a huge fan of the who and then you know that song bargain. They call it a bargain the"
04:58;05:03;"See sometimes Roger Daltrey he can sing with a really sweet"
05:03;05:10;"Sensitive kind of tenor but sometimes he can really do this like guttural kind of gnarly like Southern Rock"
05:10;05:17;"I got a I got easy win by the dead on there"
05:18;05:24;"Interesting I got in I got a divita by Iron Butterfly, which is the last song which is terrible music"
05:24;05:28;"But it's not like the most fun playlist to listen to it's more of an academic"
05:28;05:33;"Okay, this is for academics only"
05:33;05:41;"Yeah, maybe the layperson might be more interested in the next playlist you make which could be Herm Jarl"
05:41;05:48;"Aftermath, right at the end of the playlist. I put hunger strike by temple the dog. Mm-hmm"
05:48;05:50;"Cuz I think her mural"
05:50;05:58;"People look at it with a sense of humor, but there are like truly transcendent musical moments of Herm Jarl and I would say"
05:58;06:02;"Hunger strike may want to throw that on a beautiful song"
06:02;06:07;"Hunger strikes amazing and it's like Cornell doing like a really rich kind of gorgeous"
06:07;06:10;"understated Herm Jarl"
06:10;06:13;"Just two flavors of Herm Jarl"
06:14;06:24;"I don't mind stealing bread from the mouths of decadence"
06:24;06:31;"This song is where Herm met Jarl. Hey, I'm Herm. What's your name?"
06:31;06:33;"But Hermie met Jarl-y"
06:33;06:35;"When my cup's already overfilled"
06:35;06:41;"Yeah"
06:42;06:44;"Gorgeous"
06:44;06:50;"I was texting with with friend of the show Stephen hiding today about this"
06:50;06:56;"He was like I get legit chills when a better comes in I feel that and I was like, I totally feel that"
06:56;06:58;"The blood is on the table and the mouths are choking"
06:58;07:24;"How high did this song make it in the charts? Seinfeld, we have number crunch"
07:26;07:30;"Was this like Billboard top 40? I feel like it was a big hit"
07:30;07:34;"It's definitely you know, it's just funny sometimes like with rock radio"
07:34;07:37;"Yeah, it could be like number one"
07:37;07:45;"1991 rock tracks and it's like peak 97 on the number in the 90s probably would have made it pretty high"
07:45;07:49;"definitely like on constant rotation on MTV"
07:49;07:53;"It peaked at number four on the US mainstream"
07:53;07:56;"Billboard chart. Whoa top five"
07:56;07:59;"91"
07:59;08:04;"Man mainstream rock chart. Oh, it wasn't the"
08:04;08:07;"Billboard 200 or whatever?"
08:07;08:09;"No, they used to have a chart called"
08:09;08:14;"Mainstream rock that ranked the most played songs on mainstream rock radio"
08:14;08:16;"I"
08:16;08:33;"Feel like there's also something about"
08:33;08:38;"Grunge music where like some of these guitars have a bit of a hermioral to"
08:38;08:42;"The guitar y'all's a bit. Oh, yeah"
08:43;08:45;"Yeah"
08:45;08:52;"Beautiful songs the temple the dog record come out after the first pearl jam album"
08:52;08:59;"Yeah, I think I must have because at the time I was like I remember I knew Eddie Vedder was already so it must must"
08:59;09:04;"I think we've talked about this on the show before but like it's so incredibly rare that in the rock world"
09:04;09:07;"That there's just like an iconic single"
09:07;09:09;"where"
09:09;09:11;"- like very famous"
09:12;09:14;"Singers"
09:14;09:18;"front man front people come together like that obviously in hip-hop"
09:18;09:21;"We have that all the time, but you know as far as the early 90s goes"
09:21;09:25;"This is like especially in the that was the early days of both their careers"
09:25;09:28;"This is like hearing Snoop Dogg for the first time on the chronic"
09:28;09:34;"You know room just Cornell and Vedder coming together like a 90s under pressure"
09:34;09:40;"Right two of the rare examples. It happens way more in pop and hip-hop"
09:41;09:44;"Yeah, I wonder why that's interesting hell of a song"
09:44;09:52;"Should we talk about the vampire weekend shirt? Oh the with the 2021. No, no the eBay shirt. Oh"
09:52;09:58;"I don't know exactly how this came up who found this was a used Seinfeld. Yes"
09:58;10:02;"So yeah, you want to kick this off a little bit of a mystery on our hands"
10:02;10:06;"So, you know a couple years ago would it have been?"
10:06;10:09;"2019"
10:09;10:14;"18 Ezra when you did that Earth Day show you did like a vampire that was"
10:14;10:17;"2019 I"
10:17;10:22;"Had done like a tie-dye shirt. I have designed like an extremely limited tie-dye shirt"
10:22;10:29;"It's 20 and it was like this like almost like meta like self-referential Earth Day"
10:29;10:34;"It had the Seinfeld logo, but it was like merged with the globe"
10:34;10:41;"art from the Father of the Bride cover and then it had the date of the shirt and the number of shirts the amount of"
10:41;10:47;"Shirts made and it was something that you guys gave away at that like very intimate"
10:47;10:53;"I mean it was a it was like this cool interesting gathering. What was the location? It was like it was in the park"
10:53;10:56;"I guess it was technically Griffith Park. It was like some little"
10:56;11:03;"inlet that you know somebody from our team found kind of like Beachwood Canyon area and"
11:04;11:09;"Yeah, we wanted to do something for Earth Days, but it was kind of like, you know to do like a big show"
11:09;11:14;"If you really like invite people you need to like involve with the city and you know"
11:14;11:21;"There's all sorts of rules and stuff. So we couldn't really just like invite the fans. So we did kind of like a friends and family"
11:21;11:24;"acoustic no PA"
11:24;11:29;"Kind of like picnic. Yeah, I think a lot of the the TC crew was there"
11:30;11:33;"Like Marcus Mumford some of the Himes came through"
11:33;11:38;"Diplo was hanging out in a tree. There's a bunch of fun people rolled up"
11:38;11:41;"I remember we tried to live stream it but there's like really bad service"
11:41;11:47;"So I think the fans probably caught like a few pixelated moments, but yeah, it was a chill thing"
11:47;11:52;"And yeah, it was very cool that you made those shirts just for the occasion and truly that's a beautiful shirt"
11:52;11:55;"Very few people have them. In fact, I know"
11:55;12:01;"Off the top of my head I can think of at least a few people my sister-in-law friend of the show Jonah Hill"
12:01;12:05;"He still rocks that sometimes. It was really well printed and"
12:05;12:10;"Of course, we could never go wide with it because using the Seinfeld logo"
12:10;12:15;"Of course Jerry and Larry would sue us in a heartbeat and we'd get C&D real quick"
12:15;12:21;"So this was truly an original Seinfeld 2000 design a real love of the game thing for you"
12:21;12:26;"You know kind of a kind vibe event. I just want to say if I remember correctly we had a"
12:26;12:31;"shirt that was being given away that there was a larger run-up and"
12:31;12:38;"Specifically this shirt was created to celebrate the t-shirt giveaway"
12:38;12:41;"So that was sort of the meta"
12:41;12:43;"It's like if you've got one of the other shirts"
12:43;12:50;"There were a limited group of people that would get this other shirt that celebrated the idea that you were giving away another shirt"
12:50;12:53;"Man, I totally forgot about that. That's right. It was"
12:53;12:56;"Sure"
12:56;12:59;"Levels levels to it"
12:59;13:06;"It was absurd and yeah, there were what did we find there were 30 printed? Yeah, so if the shirt is a bit of a lie"
13:06;13:08;"I think on the shirt"
13:08;13:11;"It says that they're 20 printed and I looked into my emails and we'd actually produce 30"
13:11;13:15;"But I think it was funnier to say that there was even a smaller quantity"
13:15;13:21;"So there was like a lost 10 batch of 10 out there beyond the what the shirt. Yes. Well the other tenor"
13:21;13:24;"That's the angels share"
13:24;13:29;"That's right. I would be remiss if I didn't say to the one of the influences of that shirt"
13:29;13:31;"Do you know that company?"
13:31;13:37;"Cactus plant flea market that does a lot of like Kanye West's merch and like did some of the Travis Scott stuff and like yeah"
13:37;13:42;"There's some kind of Pharrell connection. I think yeah, that's right. The designers friends with Pharrell"
13:42;13:44;"So I remember very distinctly"
13:44;13:49;"Photoshopping the vampire weekend logo to like make it a little bit more like homemade"
13:49;13:54;"Looking the way the cactus plant flea market does they sort of like they kind of got the lettering a little bit"
13:54;13:56;"Anyway, whatever. That's just my no no"
13:56;14:03;"Because that shirt there's something about the ink. It feels like a little thicker. It does have a handmade quality"
14:03;14:09;"It's a very special shirt, and I would say it's definitely a top 5 grail in the VW"
14:09;14:16;"Seinfeld 2000 TCU shirt universe and I especially like the ones that it's not just like a limited run"
14:16;14:19;"It's like we couldn't sell this if we wanted to you know what I mean?"
14:19;14:23;"Yeah, true love of the game, you know over the past like year"
14:23;14:26;"I've gotten like weirdly into like vintage t-shirts"
14:26;14:33;"And I've been up on eBay like weird hours before bed on my phone just like poking around and I guess eBay like all"
14:33;14:38;"Websites and platforms will like show you stuff that they think you'll be into and so like lo and behold"
14:39;14:42;"That shirt was recommended to me on"
14:42;14:46;"eBay that somebody was reselling for"
14:46;14:51;"$75 so it was kind of this weird full circle thing and then I texted you guys and then"
14:51;14:55;"We started to get into like this sort of like Orient Express"
14:55;15:03;"Style narrative right try to hunt down essentially who of the very small intimate number of people who received that shirt"
15:03;15:07;"Would have had the audacity to then resell it on eBay"
15:07;15:10;"It is funny when you know exactly how many well"
15:10;15:15;"Yeah, they say it's only 20 copies made because that's what it says on the shirt, but you know only 30 were made"
15:15;15:18;"I know one went to a Simi Hayes"
15:18;15:26;"DJ influencer twins, I think we gave a few away to randos. I just can't even remember there were a few people"
15:26;15:28;"I didn't know there, but yeah, here's the thing"
15:28;15:34;"I think Seinfeld you were a little more like perturbed about who would sell this you wanted to cuff them"
15:34;15:38;"Get him in the slammer. I felt a little bit like listen, I don't know"
15:38;15:43;"Maybe it's like maybe somebody from the band and they were like I have so many vampire weekend shirts"
15:43;15:50;"I don't need this. There's a lot like I accept that there's a lot of people who could sell it and maybe you know"
15:50;15:52;"It's it's cool with me if they want to sell it"
15:52;15:56;"It is just funny to know that we're so close to knowing who it is"
15:56;16:01;"I think that's what motivated me. It wasn't like some sort of bloodlust to like the culprit"
16:01;16:07;"It was more like this is an actual like achievable like you could probably if we really all"
16:07;16:12;"Wanted to we could probably figure out what the origin point of this was"
16:12;16:18;"Incidentally from the freezer, I think did end up buying the shirt at least for now. We know who has it"
16:18;16:21;"Yeah, these shirts it's like they're like Dragon Balls"
16:21;16:27;"There's a very set number in the world at any given moment. Everybody wants to know where they are"
16:28;16:31;"It's very important to like the power balance of society"
16:31;16:38;"so whoever sold it it went to the right person from the freezer who's and also shout out to from the freezer because"
16:38;16:44;"Not only is he kind of like the foremost archivist in the vampire weekend world"
16:44;16:51;"He runs the great social media accounts. It's cool to know that he's out there still collecting. I still think Seinfeld sold it"
16:51;16:56;"Hey, I would look I told you I didn't even keep one for myself"
16:56;16:58;"That's how benevolent I am"
16:58;17:04;"but I agree that it's almost like it's found its way to the like Library of Congress of like"
17:04;17:09;"Vampire weekend slash time crisis merch and it does feel like it's sort of founded a good home"
17:09;17:13;"But seriously if you sold this shirt"
17:13;17:19;"Hit us up. Just kind of want to hear your story and was going through your mind. All right. Well"
17:19;17:25;"So we got a real jam-packed show today. We got a lot to cover starting 2020 and off with a bang"
17:26;17:28;"but our first guest"
17:28;17:34;"Maybe he'll want to talk about her mural, but I doubt it because his favorite band has very little her more y'all"
17:34;17:38;"I would say and they're singing we got a dude named Dave Furch"
17:38;17:42;"coming out of Florida and he opened a"
17:42;17:44;"fish themed"
17:44;17:51;"Bagel and sandwich deli it's called split open and melt which is a fish song and"
17:53;17:55;"Jake this you're the one who found this, right?"
17:55;18:00;"Yeah, I don't know why I somehow stumbled across it and I immediately thought TC"
18:00;18:05;"Obviously, I'm looking at the menu now. It's not even like the whole place is fish themed. It's"
18:05;18:10;"Music themed but you fish kind of got pride of place inspiring the name"
18:10;18:16;"So let's get Dave on the horn and find out what's going on down at split open and melt"
18:16;18:19;"It just opened last month December 2020"
18:19;18:22;"Let's go to the time crisis hotline"
18:22;18:24;"I"
18:24;18:31;"Dave welcome to time crisis. So where exactly are you down in Florida?"
18:31;18:34;"Fernandina Beach, it's like"
18:34;18:41;"About half hour northeast of Jacksonville. What's the vibe out in Fernandina Beach? I'm not familiar with it. I've been in Jacksonville"
18:41;18:44;"It's very touristy, but very laid-back"
18:44;18:46;"It's a family town"
18:46;18:53;"But it's it relies a lot on like a lot of people coming in to visit a lot of golfing a lot of nice hotels"
18:53;18:56;"And places to stay it's right on the beach"
18:56;19:04;"So the right on the Atlantic so makes makes for great tourism for everything. So what's the vibe right now?"
19:04;19:07;"I mean, you know, you're so many stories in the whole country about"
19:07;19:12;"Restaurants and cafes closing, but you're opening this spot"
19:12;19:19;"What's going on in that part of Florida people out and about are there still tourists coming down? That was really something that I really"
19:19;19:23;"struggled with and needed to like"
19:23;19:30;"Think about when to open when was the right time and I got to a point where it was"
19:30;19:35;"You know just trusting my instincts trusting what I've heard on the news, you know"
19:35;19:38;"the vibe in Florida right now is"
19:39;19:45;"It's not as strict as other parts of the country and I'm not gonna say whether that's bad or good"
19:45;19:47;"but the way that it is is"
19:47;19:53;"it's more relaxed probably than then probably like other parts of the country and"
19:53;19:55;"I think the vibe is"
19:55;20:01;"We want to get through it, but we're still gonna mask up and do what we have to do"
20:01;20:06;"Together to get through right the long-term goal is to get through it how we do that it you know"
20:07;20:10;"Wearing the masks and all that, you know to get through it"
20:10;20:17;"It's definitely important right? Well, and so your spot is named after a fish song"
20:17;20:22;"Yes massive fish fan. I've developed into one"
20:22;20:27;"I really enjoy their music and I've always gone back to fish"
20:27;20:33;"I've seen them only 24 times, but I first saw him in 1995"
20:34;20:39;"So, okay. All I understand some of the fans probably eclipsed me in one tour"
20:39;20:44;"I go back, you know way back and I saw him when I was in college and"
20:44;20:47;"They've always been with me"
20:47;20:49;"You know through you know"
20:49;20:55;"The best days that I've had in the worst days that I've had so I always go back to them and really enjoy their jams"
20:55;21:00;"I really enjoy the fact that they don't repeat their set list. I think that's really cool and"
21:01;21:04;"Just the way that they engage with their fans"
21:04;21:12;"Really says a lot to me. So absolutely awesome one also going back to 95 that's considered real banner year for fish"
21:12;21:19;"Yeah, so I know because our producer said they use the same phrase with him when you guys were chatting"
21:19;21:24;"I've only seen 24 shows. I feel like you're being a little bit hard on yourself"
21:24;21:29;"I mean just because is it because in the fish community that there are just people who have seen hundreds"
21:29;21:32;"Yeah, because I've imagined a lot of our listeners are like 24"
21:32;21:38;"I've never seen anything 24 times, but you have to be a little bit humble in a community of deep fans"
21:38;21:44;"There's a lot of people that have seen a lot of shows. So I have a lot of respect for those fans that have I"
21:44;21:51;"Think that's really cool. I also understand there's probably some fans that have only seen you know, maybe a couple times"
21:51;21:54;"so it's like a mixed bag, it's like a huge community and"
21:54;21:57;"Fish is a great band and they're a lot of fun"
21:57;22:01;"I advise people to go see them as many times as they can"
22:02;22:06;"In the morning I pack up my gear and toss it in my carry-on"
22:06;22:11;"Rumble my little tulip and watch the big coral crack and roll"
22:11;22:16;"In the evening I undo my belt, split open and melt"
22:28;22:32;"I wake up on my stomach with my face between my hands"
22:32;22:36;"And crawl on the floor towards the doorway"
22:36;22:41;"Jump into my feet, I try to pull myself together"
22:41;22:45;"But I feel it in my knees and the room begins to spin"
22:45;22:49;"And I slip and fall my head and raise a well-oiled belt"
22:49;22:51;"Split open and melt"
22:54;23:00;"We've talked a lot on our show about which parts of the country are jam country"
23:00;23:04;"Because like LA interestingly is not so jammy"
23:04;23:07;"Obviously Northern California is very jammy"
23:07;23:11;"I know that there are some very iconic fish shows happened in Florida"
23:11;23:16;"In fact they were down in Florida for maybe their biggest show ever which was at New Year's 99"
23:16;23:22;"But is the Fernandina Beach area jam country?"
23:22;23:25;"I would say it's more country than anything else"
23:25;23:26;"Country, country"
23:26;23:28;"Yeah, like country music"
23:28;23:32;"There's a lot of country music fans but there's also a lot of rock fans too"
23:32;23:37;"So it's really a lot of people from the Northeast and Upper Midwest"
23:37;23:40;"Either move down here or retire down here"
23:40;23:46;"So there's a lot of people that like fish or are familiar with fish"
23:46;23:48;"Or you know some kind of jam band"
23:48;23:52;"Widespread panic in Atlanta, you know out of the Southeast"
23:52;23:55;"I'm Frizz McGee from Chicago area"
23:55;23:57;"You know obviously Grateful Dead"
23:57;24:03;"But Florida is like I said before it's a very big mixture of a lot of different people"
24:03;24:10;"Not only who grew up here but also people that are from other parts of America that have moved down here"
24:10;24:11;"Sure"
24:11;24:14;"So far I know you've only been open less than a month"
24:14;24:23;"Do you feel like the people coming down are disproportionately jam enthusiasts or rock fans?"
24:23;24:26;"Or is it like just bagel lovers?"
24:26;24:33;"A lot of both and we've really had a great reception so far and I've really been like really overwhelmed"
24:33;24:37;"It's a mixture between people that are interested in the name"
24:37;24:41;"And a lot of fish fans have reached out to me and said hey that's really cool"
24:41;24:44;"The next time I'm in the area I want to swing by"
24:44;24:46;"And that's really meant a lot to me"
24:46;24:52;"Also people from Jacksonville that like fish or like you know jam bands or rock and roll"
24:52;24:55;"They also have an interest in checking the shop out"
24:55;25:03;"I'm named it after fish but every bagel name in the shop that we sell is named after a music song"
25:03;25:09;"So I have all the albums from those artists up in my shop"
25:09;25:14;"So I have like a Grateful Dead bagel name called Help on the Way"
25:14;25:18;"And I have their album up in the shop with a little piece of artwork on there"
25:18;25:21;"So it's that plus all these other"
25:21;25:22;"What's on the Help on the Way?"
25:22;25:27;"Oh boy, roast beef and cream cheese on an onion bagel"
25:27;25:28;"Woo!"
25:28;25:30;"Yeah, it's really good"
25:30;25:33;"And we steam our bagels so they come out nice and soft"
25:33;25:36;"I see you have a REM bagel"
25:36;25:38;"Talk about the passion"
25:38;25:40;"I think that's a good name for a bagel"
25:40;25:42;"Yeah, it's a good one"
25:42;25:46;"Yeah, I just took some of my favorite songs"
25:46;25:51;"Like some of my favorite artists and then researched the song names"
25:51;25:55;"And then went from there as far as like that"
25:55;26:00;"Unfortunately I didn't have anything for Vampire Weekend so I apologize"
26:00;26:01;"It's all good"
26:01;26:02;"You know what?"
26:02;26:04;"We want to earn our bagel"
26:04;26:08;"We haven't played in the Jacksonville area I think since"
26:08;26:11;"Like our first tour since like 2007"
26:11;26:15;"So we got to come back and win over some hearts and minds in the J-ville area"
26:15;26:16;"You know what I mean?"
26:16;26:17;"We can't play here"
26:17;26:20;"Well specifically we're going to come to Fernandina Beach"
26:20;26:23;"And then maybe you could consider it, but no pressure"
26:23;26:26;"So you're making these bagels in-house?"
26:26;26:29;"No, we have a great supplier for the bagels"
26:29;26:31;"And they're New York style bagels"
26:31;26:37;"And they come to us frozen and then we steam them in the steamer when we make the sandwiches"
26:37;26:41;"So they come out really nice and soft and melty"
26:41;26:47;"And they make a great combination of flavors while you're biting them"
26:47;26:50;"Do you have any background working in restaurants or food stuff?"
26:50;26:54;"Or is this just like a dream that you were jumping into headfirst?"
26:54;27:00;"I went to Miami University, which is just north of Cincinnati"
27:00;27:03;"I worked at the Bagel & Deli in Oxford, Ohio"
27:03;27:07;"Did that for a couple years and I really enjoyed it"
27:07;27:11;"And I always wanted to like recreate something in my life"
27:11;27:14;"Where I could open up something similar that would like"
27:14;27:19;"Kind of pay homage to the time that I was working there"
27:19;27:21;"So that was really important to me"
27:21;27:24;"And you know it just really impacted me"
27:24;27:27;"All the people that I worked with, folks that I worked for"
27:27;27:31;"Ned Stevenson and Gary Franks, they were great to work for"
27:31;27:36;"And we would literally bring in like all these kinds of music"
27:36;27:40;"And listen to you know Grateful Dead, Bob Marley"
27:40;27:44;"All these 90s bands that were coming up at that time"
27:44;27:47;"It was just like the time of my life"
27:47;27:49;"And I really wanted to try to recreate that"
27:49;27:55;"By opening up something that was kind of like mimicking it"
27:55;27:59;"I would never be able to recreate the same place"
27:59;28:01;"Because it's just really impossible"
28:01;28:04;"It's that like high up in my echelon"
28:04;28:05;"That's sick"
28:05;28:07;"Well that kind of leads me into my next question"
28:07;28:10;"Because I love that vibe that you're describing"
28:10;28:13;"Of kind of like an independent eatery"
28:13;28:16;"Where there's like college students working"
28:16;28:18;"Just playing whatever music they want"
28:18;28:20;"That kind of community feel"
28:20;28:23;"Which obviously in this world, especially post-COVID"
28:23;28:25;"We got less and less of"
28:25;28:28;"So that's sick that you're doing a place that actually has a unique character"
28:28;28:31;"And that your goal is to build community like that"
28:31;28:36;"So I gotta ask, is the bagel scene kind of like corporate in Fernandina Beach?"
28:36;28:39;"We got a lot of Einstein's and things like that"
28:39;28:41;"What are you working with out there?"
28:41;28:45;"We have one other local shop that's small like me"
28:45;28:47;"They do a good job and they're a good competitor"
28:47;28:49;"But they don't steam their bagels"
28:49;28:53;"So we have a unique advantage over them right away"
28:53;28:55;"But they've been there for a couple years"
28:55;28:57;"So a lot of people know them and like them"
28:57;28:59;"And then we have Panera"
28:59;29:01;"Which they're okay also"
29:01;29:06;"But for the most part it's just basically us two on the island"
29:06;29:08;"The pressure builds"
29:08;29:10;"You buy a gift"
29:10;29:13;"You're hoping that your dread will lift"
29:13;29:17;"It glitters on her like a glass"
29:17;29:20;"You shudder as it comes to pass"
29:20;29:24;"Apologize to Luce and Lil"
29:24;29:27;"Converse with Ed, a drive with Jill"
29:27;29:30;"Your friends can find you in their worlds"
29:30;29:34;"One by one, a string of pearls"
29:34;29:37;"Confused you say, ""This isn't me"""
29:37;29:41;"You hover in their unity"
29:41;29:44;"Ashamed you slowly loose your grasp"
29:44;29:48;"Release the links, undo the clasp"
29:48;29:51;"The skin that drips down off the tree"
29:51;29:55;"Or peels back slowly from your knee"
29:55;29:58;"Erupts into your lung and heart"
29:58;30:01;"You laugh and laughing fall apart"
30:01;30:03;"You know, in thinking about it"
30:03;30:04;"I've never actually been inside"
30:04;30:07;"Because I remember it was closed last time I was there"
30:07;30:11;"But I know that there's a spot in Aspen, Colorado"
30:11;30:13;"Called The Grateful Deli"
30:13;30:16;"And they have, you know, obviously Grateful Dead themed stuff"
30:16;30:19;"And I feel like TC heads are always sending me pictures"
30:19;30:20;"Of The Grateful Deli in Aspen"
30:20;30:22;"So that's getting me thinking"
30:22;30:27;"I wonder how many, like, Jam Band inspired"
30:27;30:30;"Delis and cafes there are in the whole US"
30:30;30:34;"Because I feel like you guys should probably form some sort of, like, alliance"
30:34;30:36;"Are you aware of any other ones?"
30:36;30:38;"Like, you should have some sort of, like, I don't know, like"
30:38;30:40;"Maybe, like, an exchange program"
30:40;30:43;"People want to, like, work between them"
30:43;30:45;"Or, I don't know, like"
30:45;30:47;"Have you heard of any other ones?"
30:47;30:49;"I haven't, but that's a great point"
30:49;30:51;"I mean, I'm sure there are other ones"
30:51;30:55;"I mean, when I was doing the research for the name of the shop"
30:55;30:57;"I just googled ""Split Open and Melt"""
30:57;31:00;"And, you know, nobody had that name"
31:00;31:02;"As far as, you know, anything in Florida"
31:02;31:05;"So I was able to use that"
31:05;31:08;"And then I wrote Fish for their approval"
31:08;31:11;"And they wrote me back and said that was fine"
31:11;31:15;"But there's a lot of creative people in the food and beverage industry"
31:15;31:20;"So I'm sure that there are a lot of other ones that definitely could be in the network for sure"
31:20;31:25;"There's Fire in the Mountain Buffalo Wings in Portland, Oregon"
31:25;31:27;"Oh, right! Okay"
31:27;31:29;"Where's that one located?"
31:29;31:31;"Portland, Oregon"
31:31;31:33;"Okay, off to go there next time I'm there"
31:33;31:35;"Well, any TC Heads, if you're aware of any"
31:35;31:38;"It's the exact type of thing, it's not that easy to google"
31:38;31:40;"If anybody has any"
31:40;31:42;"I really think this would be cool"
31:42;31:45;"I just feel like all you guys should be in contact with each other"
31:45;31:48;"And I feel like that should at least exist somewhere on the internet"
31:48;31:50;"Like a map"
31:50;31:52;"Especially because when concerts come back"
31:52;31:55;"Nobody's on the road more than like Jam Band fans"
31:55;31:58;"So that could be like a fun trip"
31:58;32:00;"Like, oh, we're going down to Florida to hit Split Open and Melt"
32:00;32:02;"Then we're ripping west"
32:02;32:05;"I don't know what there is in between Florida and Colorado"
32:05;32:09;"But at the very least we're going to get out to Grateful Deli"
32:09;32:11;"And then we're going to hit Fire in the Mountain Wings"
32:11;32:13;"I bet there's so many small ones all over"
32:13;32:15;"Yeah, one thing I learned"
32:15;32:20;"There's a Facebook page called ""You Enjoy My Food"""
32:20;32:24;"I wasn't aware of that, but somebody told me that"
32:24;32:29;"And you can go on Facebook and search ""You Enjoy My Food"""
32:29;32:32;"And it's all fish fans that are foodies"
32:32;32:39;"And they'll post pictures of either fish or other places that they've found"
32:39;32:41;"Well, congratulations"
32:41;32:43;"And I really hope"
32:43;32:46;"I mean, really gotta believe that it's only going to get better"
32:46;32:49;"Because you opened at such a challenging time"
32:49;32:54;"So, I mean, imagine by like spring break this year"
32:54;32:57;"One way or another it's going to be slam"
32:57;32:59;"That's kind of amazing to think that"
32:59;33:03;"As crazy as this past year was"
33:03;33:07;"Florida will basically not have missed a single spring break season"
33:07;33:10;"Because it was jammed last year"
33:10;33:14;"And this year a lot of people will be vaccinated by then"
33:14;33:17;"And I think it'll be a big season"
33:17;33:20;"Anybody down in the J-Ville area, check out"
33:20;33:22;"By the way, is it okay to say J-Ville?"
33:22;33:26;"I don't live there anymore, so I'm going to give you approval to do that"
33:26;33:29;"I'm not going to stand in your way because it is your podcast"
33:29;33:32;"Thank you, well it's an internet radio show"
33:32;33:38;"Are there any nicknames for Fernandina Beach?"
33:38;33:40;"No, not that I know of"
33:40;33:42;"The Dina?"
33:42;33:46;"You can make it now, I mean, I'm sure people have called it that"
33:46;33:49;"Okay, well anybody down there, you gotta go check it out"
33:49;33:53;"And again, please, I really think it would be fun and useful"
33:53;33:57;"To kind of put together the Jam Band Eatery Map of the US"
33:57;34:01;"Maybe I could make a Reddit, you know, like a subreddit"
34:01;34:03;"Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely"
34:03;34:05;"Oh, and I guess last question"
34:05;34:08;"Is there room in the shop for concerts?"
34:08;34:15;"Um, we could do maybe like a tiny desk concert setup maybe"
34:15;34:18;"We have space"
34:18;34:21;"We only have 17 chairs right now"
34:21;34:25;"So we definitely have room, you know, because of social distancing"
34:25;34:31;"So we definitely have room for, you know, throwing a couple guitars and drums set in"
34:31;34:35;"You know, by all means, you're welcome to come in and do that"
34:35;34:36;"Alright, good to know"
34:36;34:38;"Well, sick, thanks so much dude"
34:38;34:41;"Good talking to you and yeah, good luck with the continued launch"
34:41;34:43;"And the continued success of the shop"
34:43;34:45;"Thank you, appreciate it"
34:45;34:47;"Yeah, good talking with you Ezra"
34:47;34:49;"Appreciate it, have a good day"
34:49;34:51;"Mmm, I want a bagel now"
34:51;34:57;"Gotta go down to Furby"
34:57;35:02;"Wait, Fernadina Beach, aka Furby"
35:02;35:03;"That's a great one"
35:03;35:05;"That's better than the Dina"
35:05;35:09;"Yeah, especially because there's already a Dina where Richard Pictures plays"
35:09;35:11;"Yo, this could be a million dollar idea"
35:11;35:14;"Because this, what if this is like the biggest spring break ever"
35:14;35:18;"What if we roll down to Fernadina Beach and make Furbies"
35:18;35:20;"That say like, Furby"
35:20;35:22;"We could kind of like own this somehow"
35:22;35:26;"We'll do the uncut gems, blinged out Furby"
35:26;35:29;"On a surfboard down in Fernadina Beach"
35:29;35:31;"Wait, what's a Furby? I don't remember what that is"
35:31;35:33;"Really?"
35:33;35:34;"Here we go"
35:34;35:37;"Well, it's a toy, does that jog your memory?"
35:37;35:41;"It was a popular toy, I guess? Late 90s, early 2000s?"
35:41;35:42;"No"
35:42;35:46;"It was the Tickle Me Elmo of what, a couple of years"
35:46;35:48;"Oh, I missed that"
35:48;35:53;"It has these big goggly eyes that look left to right and they can blink"
35:53;35:55;"Did you see Uncut Gems?"
35:55;36:02;"In Uncut Gems, there's like a brief shot where the guy shows this kind of like diamond encrusted Furby chain"
36:02;36:03;"Okay"
36:03;36:07;"Was a Furby actually like a crude artificial intelligence?"
36:07;36:09;"Didn't Furbies have machine learning?"
36:09;36:13;"I think they did have futuristic machine learning capabilities"
36:13;36:19;"I think it could say a few rudimentary phrases, right? Like ""I love you"" and stuff?"
36:19;36:22;"I think it would learn, it would like observe and learn"
36:22;36:23;"That sounds terrifying"
36:23;36:26;"There's an article called Furby the Primitive AI"
36:26;36:27;"Oh really?"
36:27;36:28;"Yeah, Pur-"
36:28;36:29;"I wrote it"
36:29;36:30;"You wrote it?"
36:30;36:34;"A newly purchased Furby starts out entirely speaking Furbish"
36:34;36:38;"But is programmed to use English words and phrases over time"
36:38;36:41;"But this toy was a big deal 20 years ago?"
36:41;36:43;"It came out in 1998"
36:43;36:50;"Get this, the updated Emotronic Furby had voice recognition and complex facial movements"
36:50;36:53;"Was sold by Hasbro between '05 and '07"
36:53;36:56;"Now's a great time to bring back Furby"
36:56;36:59;"Hold on, let me see if they still make them"
36:59;37:04;"I'm looking at Amazon right now, yeah they're selling Furbies"
37:04;37:07;"You can buy a Star Wars Furbacca"
37:07;37:13;"So I guess there's still a market for it, maybe they're just not quite as popular as they used to be"
37:13;37:16;"Alright, so we know what to get Jake for his next birthday"
37:16;37:17;"It's coming up"
37:17;37:19;"Oh yeah, when is your birthday?"
37:19;37:20;"February 3rd"
37:20;37:22;"Oh yeah, real soon"
37:22;37:24;"Turning the ripe old age of 44"
37:24;37:26;"That's a strong age"
37:26;37:27;"That's a real ass age"
37:27;37:29;"44 years old"
37:29;37:34;"So, our next guest is a legendary producer and musician"
37:34;37:38;"His name is Jack, I'm putting my money on Endino"
37:38;37:40;"But I like it's Endino"
37:40;37:42;"We're gonna clarify with the man himself"
37:42;37:46;"He produced Nirvana's first album, Bleach"
37:46;37:53;"He's also produced albums for bands like Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Hot Hot Heat, Winnebago Deal, Valiant Thor, and many more"
37:53;37:56;"He's released music as a solo artist"
37:56;38:01;"He's also been in bands like Candy Coated"
38:01;38:04;"The reason that we reached out to him in the first place though"
38:04;38:08;"Is because he wrote a post on his website in the year 2000"
38:08;38:13;"Kind of amazing to think we're talking about a 20 year old blog post"
38:13;38:16;"And he wrote about the world Jarl"
38:16;38:18;"And he defined it thus"
38:18;38:26;"To Jarl is to sing melodramatically with a sort of barely suppressed letter R sound lurking beneath every other syllable"
38:26;38:31;"Yeah, that checks out, the R, just like the omnipresent Rrrrr"
38:31;38:34;"When I mention it, people always know exactly what I mean"
38:34;38:39;"Steve Turner describes it as singing as though your lower lip is stuck way out"
38:39;38:44;"I think this post kind of put a lot of people onto the phrase Jarl"
38:44;38:51;"In the year 2000, I guess, yeah, it's interesting to think, like, that was still kind of like prime Jarl territory"
38:51;38:54;"I mean, that was the height of creed, really"
38:54;38:59;"And he specifically points out creed, he says the singer for creed is the current expert"
38:59;39:03;"Cranroot, he writes that in a really funny way, you should go read the post"
39:03;39:07;"Cranrootrick, me heart"
39:07;39:09;"He basically puts an R into every word"
39:09;39:11;"He Jarls in their big radio song"
39:11;39:14;"Days of the new coming to mind, god smack, there are plenty of others"
39:14;39:19;"The problem is that the current crop of Jarlers are copying their shtick from our homeboys, Lane and Eddie V"
39:19;39:21;"Who are actually quite restrained at Jarling"
39:21;39:24;"Eddie hardly did it at all after the first PJ album"
39:24;39:27;"Chris Cornell never did it, nor Arm"
39:27;39:28;"Don't agree"
39:28;39:30;"Lanigan and Cobain, well we can get into that"
39:30;39:33;"Lanigan and Cobain sure as hell didn't need to"
39:33;39:36;"Nonetheless, it's now Seattle singing to some people's sigh"
39:36;39:39;"Friends don't let friends Jarl, please stop the madness"
39:39;39:44;"So it seems like Jack is like unequivocally negative on Jarling"
39:44;39:48;"Yeah, although that was a very specific moment in time, 2000"
39:48;39:53;"I wonder how the passage of time might have contextualized his feelings"
39:53;39:58;"Can you ask him about his take on Alanis Morissette and the female faction of the"
39:58;40:01;"That's a great question, that's really good"
40:01;40:07;"You know you could throw in that Scott Stapp Florida Marlins song"
40:07;40:11;"Have you heard that Ezra? Or was that on the thread? I forget"
40:11;40:14;"It sounds familiar, I don't know if I listened to it"
40:14;40:16;"He wrote a song for the Florida Marlins?"
40:16;40:18;"Yeah"
40:18;40:27;"The harmonies"
40:27;40:30;"You're all on the ground"
40:30;40:35;"Come on Marlins, make us proud"
40:35;40:39;"Come on Marlins, make us proud"
40:39;40:44;"Keep hoping and dreaming that you will"
40:44;40:48;"Soar"
40:48;40:49;"With the little"
40:49;40:53;"The lyrics are kind of like someone who's never seen baseball, you know"
40:53;40:54;"Hit"
40:54;40:56;"We want hit"
40:56;40:57;"We want hit"
40:57;40:58;"Pitch it"
40:58;41:01;"One strike, two strikes, swing away"
41:01;41:05;"A tight pitch, a stolen base"
41:05;41:06;"Base"
41:06;41:10;"A perfect game, a triple play"
41:10;41:13;"Oh yeah, he's never actually seen baseball"
41:13;41:15;"Yeah, I want"
41:15;41:21;"A perfect game, a triple play are the most obscure and rare occurrences in baseball"
41:21;41:25;"Keep hoping and dreaming that you will"
41:25;41:29;"Soar"
41:29;41:33;"With the little thing that long"
41:33;41:38;"You will soar"
41:38;41:43;"Keep hoping and dreaming that you will"
41:43;41:44;"Soar"
41:44;41:46;"It's so serious"
41:46;41:50;"Keep hoping and dreaming and you will what?"
41:50;41:53;"Double plays"
41:53;41:56;"He really is like the uber-Yarl"
41:56;41:58;"Yeah, I mean he took it to the next level"
41:58;42:01;"He took it to absolute God level"
42:01;42:04;"Oh, it's keep hoping and dreaming and you will soar"
42:04;42:05;"Okay"
42:05;42:09;"So Scott Stapp played baseball in high school"
42:09;42:11;"And this is a funny quote about him playing baseball"
42:11;42:13;"Something again just makes me sound like he"
42:13;42:15;"It just sounds to me like he doesn't actually play baseball"
42:15;42:19;"He says, ""I remember getting a hard hit ground ball to me,"" Stapp said"
42:19;42:32;"""I fielded it cleanly. I had a little ego about my arm. I crow-hopped, took a good look over it first, and didn't realize how fast Johnny Damon was. It was the first time I
ever had somebody beat me at a routine ground ball."""
42:32;42:35;"Wait, so he was playing baseball with Johnny Damon?"
42:35;42:36;"I'm confused"
42:36;42:38;"I don't know who Johnny Damon is, so I don't know"
42:38;42:39;"Is that a famous baseball player?"
42:39;42:40;"Yeah"
42:40;42:46;"Oh, it was 1990, earlier in the article, it was 1990 and Stapp was playing for Orlando's Lake High Highland Prep"
42:46;42:51;"In the APACA Invitational Tournament against Orlando"
42:51;42:57;"Dr. Phillips' team stacked with future major leaguers Damon, AJ Paritsky, and Brian Barber"
42:57;42:59;"And so I guess he was like a"
42:59;43:01;"He's a serious guy"
43:01;43:02;"Yeah"
43:02;43:08;"You hear these stories about these such like gifted athletes like a LeBron or something"
43:08;43:13;"I think he like got an offer to like play football in college or something"
43:13;43:17;"You know like you hear about these people who go on to like really dominate one sport"
43:17;43:21;"And then sometimes you find out that they were like a three-sport athlete in high school"
43:21;43:23;"And they kind of could have done any of them"
43:23;43:25;"And they even had offers on the table"
43:25;43:26;"Oh yeah"
43:26;43:31;"And it's interesting that for Scott Stapp, it might have not been multiple sports, but it might have been music and baseball"
43:31;43:37;"Like he's clearly a kind of like gifted, charismatic, alpha male type"
43:37;43:42;"And to know that he was in the mix playing with people who would go on to the MLB"
43:42;43:48;"It makes me wonder if he had taken that the challenge that he had felt from you know"
43:48;43:50;"Coming up against Johnny Damon in high school"
43:50;43:53;"And he had put that right back into baseball"
43:53;43:57;"Maybe we'd be talking about him as a guy who played for the Marlins"
43:57;43:59;"But maybe instead he was like you know what"
43:59;44:02;"I am passionate, but it's more about music or something like that"
44:02;44:07;"I feel like that story was like he like realized in that moment the limits of his talents"
44:07;44:10;"And like turned the other way towards music or something"
44:10;44:14;"It was like I thought my arm was strong and I like was cocky"
44:14;44:17;"And then Johnny Damon just like flew down the first baseline"
44:17;44:20;"And I'm out of my element here"
44:20;44:22;"That's how I interpreted it"
44:22;44:25;"Well yeah, I think that's ultimately the decision he made"
44:25;44:27;"But one way or another he was gonna, yeah"
44:27;44:31;"For all we know, Johnny Damon saw Scott Stapp on the field and had a similar feeling"
44:31;44:35;"And he chose to use that feeling of insecurity to fire himself up"
44:35;44:37;"And he put it right back into baseball"
44:37;44:41;"Whereas Scott Stapp, you know, he made maybe a smart decision"
44:41;44:45;"Or maybe Johnny Damon had a proto-grunge band in high school"
44:45;44:49;"And he saw Scott Stapp, you know, tearing it up at the talent show"
44:49;44:51;"Battled the bands and he was like"
44:51;44:55;"I gotta stick to playing shortstop"
44:55;44:57;"Sliding doors moment"
44:57;44:59;"This is being pretty tight"
44:59;45:02;"Maybe like movie or mini-series"
45:02;45:05;"That is kind of just about like what if in that moment"
45:05;45:07;"They switched"
45:07;45:09;"Scott Stapp was fired up for that game"
45:09;45:11;"Johnny Damon was having an off day"
45:11;45:13;"I think about sh*t like that all the time"
45:13;45:14;"Like with athletes"
45:14;45:18;"I actually recently watched this documentary that the Safdie brothers made"
45:18;45:19;"About Lenny Cook"
45:19;45:22;"Who was like a kind of iconic New York area"
45:22;45:24;"Do you remember him Jake?"
45:24;45:25;"Sure, of course"
45:25;45:26;"Is that a new doc?"
45:26;45:28;"No, it came out a long time ago"
45:28;45:29;"Just happened to be streaming"
45:29;45:31;"And for people who don't know"
45:31;45:35;"Lenny Cook was at one point considered like the number one prospect"
45:35;45:38;"For high school basketball players in America"
45:38;45:41;"And he seemed like a very likely person"
45:41;45:43;"To go straight into the NBA"
45:43;45:44;"Like Kobe style"
45:44;45:45;"Yeah"
45:45;45:46;"He had been having some bad luck"
45:46;45:48;"Maybe made some bad decisions"
45:48;45:50;"And when he finally went into the draft"
45:50;45:51;"No team drafted him"
45:51;45:53;"But when he was young"
45:53;45:56;"And he was playing in these like high school tournaments"
45:56;45:57;"The best of the country"
45:57;45:59;"He was going head to head with people like"
45:59;46:01;"LeBron, Carmelo, Anthony"
46:01;46:03;"You know, people like that"
46:03;46:06;"So you think about these key moments"
46:06;46:08;"Like here's a guy"
46:08;46:10;"Who he played LeBron once"
46:10;46:13;"When they were like 17 or 18"
46:13;46:14;"And you think"
46:14;46:16;"And that day LeBron happened to be in kind of like"
46:16;46:18;"Better form"
46:18;46:20;"And you just think about like how much"
46:20;46:22;"In something like sports"
46:22;46:24;"How much one day could impact"
46:24;46:26;"How you feel about yourself"
46:26;46:28;"How the world perceives your team"
46:28;46:29;"I mean obviously"
46:29;46:30;"Even if you have a bad game"
46:30;46:32;"You have to just keep like working through it"
46:32;46:33;"But just think about like"
46:33;46:35;"What if he just kind of got a little bit luckier in that game"
46:35;46:37;"And like he kind of just like"
46:37;46:39;"Made LeBron fall down or something"
46:39;46:40;"Who knows?"
46:40;46:42;"And it is just very dramatic to think about"
46:42;46:44;"LeBron considered one of the"
46:44;46:47;"Maybe the best basketball player of all time"
46:47;46:49;"Versus a guy who didn't even get drafted"
46:49;46:51;"But there was a moment where they were talked about"
46:51;46:52;"In the same breath"
46:52;46:53;"So anyway"
46:53;46:55;"I think it's very possible that"
46:55;46:56;"There could have been"
46:56;46:59;"Also maybe the reason I'm saying this about Scott Stapp is"
46:59;47:01;"Because he just looks like such a baseball player"
47:01;47:03;"I just can see him in the uniform now"
47:03;47:04;"Now that we know this"
47:04;47:05;"That he played"
47:05;47:06;"I can just see"
47:06;47:07;"And I'm picturing"
47:07;47:09;"I know he's had struggles in his life"
47:09;47:11;"And I know he's had a hard life"
47:11;47:12;"In many ways"
47:12;47:13;"But I'm picturing him"
47:13;47:14;"Just in his kind of"
47:14;47:15;"Peak creed days"
47:15;47:17;"Just that long hair"
47:17;47:18;"He's in great shape"
47:18;47:19;"Very handsome guy"
47:19;47:21;"Just kind of a golden god"
47:21;47:23;"I can just picture him wearing a baseball uniform"
47:23;47:24;"I can picture him on"
47:24;47:25;"You know on the Yankees"
47:25;47:27;"This is Scott Stapp from Florida"
47:27;47:28;"You know"
47:28;47:29;"Dude"
47:29;47:31;"I can picture him as like a real sweaty reliever"
47:31;47:34;"Like a closer"
47:34;47:35;"Coming in in the ninth inning"
47:35;47:37;"Just throwing like 98"
47:37;47:39;"Everything is just like fire"
47:39;47:40;"Yeah"
47:40;47:41;"I can totally see it"
47:41;47:42;"You know who I always thought"
47:42;47:43;"I mean"
47:43;47:45;"They're probably around the same age actually"
47:45;47:47;"Who'd be great as Scott Stapp in a movie"
47:47;47:48;"Is Colin Farrell"
47:48;47:49;"Oh yeah"
47:49;47:50;"Colin Farrell"
47:50;47:51;"Get the long hair on Farrell"
47:51;47:52;"Yeah"
47:52;47:54;"Let's see if we can get Farrell"
47:54;47:55;"Attached"
47:55;47:57;"Let's see if we can get Farrell"
47:57;47:59;"Attached to the project"
47:59;48:01;"Imagine that we somehow use connections"
48:01;48:03;"To get Colin Farrell on a Zoom"
48:03;48:04;"And we're just like"
48:04;48:05;"Mr. Farrell"
48:05;48:06;"Did you know"
48:06;48:07;"That in high school"
48:07;48:08;"In one game"
48:08;48:10;"Scott Stapp was up against Johnny Damon"
48:10;48:11;"He'd just be like"
48:11;48:12;"I don't know"
48:12;48:14;"Who the f*** you're talking about"
48:14;48:15;"Who the f*** is Johnny Damon"
48:15;48:17;"I don't know Johnny Damon"
48:17;48:19;"That was my really bad Irish accent"
48:19;48:20;"Mr. Farrell"
48:20;48:22;"Are you familiar with the American band Creed?"
48:22;48:23;"They're s*** man"
48:23;48:26;"(Laughter)"
48:26;48:28;"Okay so now"
48:28;48:30;"Now we got Jack on the horn"
48:30;48:32;"The man who wrote the definitive essay on"
48:32;48:34;"Yarling"
48:34;48:36;"And an iconic producer and musician"
48:36;48:37;"Let's talk to him"
48:37;48:41;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
48:41;48:44;"(Phone ringing)"
48:44;48:46;"Hey Jack how you doing?"
48:46;48:47;"Yes sir"
48:47;48:48;"You're on with me"
48:48;48:50;"Ezra, Jake is also here"
48:50;48:51;"Thanks so much for coming on Time Crisis"
48:51;48:52;"Hi Jack"
48:52;48:53;"It's a pleasure"
48:53;48:55;"And we just want to double check"
48:55;48:57;"Is your last name pronounced Indino?"
48:57;48:58;"Yes"
48:58;48:59;"Okay"
48:59;49:01;"So we've been talking about"
49:01;49:02;"Yarling"
49:02;49:04;"For quite a bit"
49:04;49:06;"As one does"
49:06;49:07;"As one does"
49:07;49:09;"I mean so you wrote this essay"
49:09;49:10;"20 years ago"
49:10;49:12;"And obviously you observed"
49:12;49:13;"As somebody"
49:13;49:15;"Such a huge part of like the"
49:15;49:16;"Seattle scene"
49:16;49:17;"You observed"
49:17;49:19;"A concept"
49:19;49:20;"Mistakenly perhaps"
49:20;49:22;"Taken from that world"
49:22;49:25;"So you watched the 20 years of it growing"
49:25;49:27;"And somehow in 2020"
49:27;49:29;"We're still talking about it"
49:29;49:31;"I don't know how much the world is still talking about it"
49:31;49:32;"I'm not sure why"
49:32;49:34;"Why are you guys still talking about this?"
49:34;49:36;"(Laughter)"
49:36;49:37;"Well"
49:37;49:39;"I guess we were trying to get to the bottom of it"
49:39;49:40;"Is really how it started"
49:40;49:43;"Because it's such a specific way of singing"
49:43;49:44;"And so first of all"
49:44;49:46;"In the original essay"
49:46;49:48;"The post that you wrote in 2000"
49:48;49:50;"Which I think kind of popularized the term Yarl"
49:50;49:52;"You give credits to your friends"
49:52;49:54;"For creating the term"
49:54;49:55;"Is that correct?"
49:55;49:57;"Yeah a drummer in a band I was in"
49:57;49:58;"Actually was using the word"
49:58;49:59;"And he described it to me"
49:59;50:00;"And I thought"
50:00;50:02;"Oh I know exactly what you're talking about"
50:02;50:04;"Because we were talking about somebody"
50:04;50:05;"A mutual friend of ours"
50:05;50:07;"Who was kind of singing that way"
50:07;50:08;"And then I realized"
50:08;50:09;"Oh wait a minute"
50:09;50:10;"This is much more widespread"
50:10;50:11;"You know it's something"
50:11;50:12;"Maybe Eddie Vedder did it a little bit"
50:12;50:14;"In the early days"
50:14;50:16;"And my good friend Ben and Gruntruck"
50:16;50:18;"Did it a little bit"
50:18;50:19;"But then you know"
50:19;50:21;"You can go back to other singers"
50:21;50:22;"Blood, sweat and tears"
50:22;50:23;"And The Guest Who"
50:23;50:25;"And Al Green a little bit"
50:25;50:27;"And you can go forward from that"
50:27;50:28;"And you've got like"
50:28;50:29;"Terrible sort of"
50:29;50:30;"Second generation grunge bands"
50:30;50:31;"Of the 90s"
50:31;50:33;"That were doing it"
50:33;50:34;"And it was kind of painful"
50:34;50:35;"Right because we were picturing"
50:35;50:37;"The moment when you were"
50:37;50:39;"Writing about it in 2000"
50:39;50:40;"That was still when like"
50:40;50:42;"Creed was massive"
50:42;50:43;"So you were right in the middle"
50:43;50:44;"Of seeing this"
50:44;50:45;"Whatever you call this"
50:45;50:46;"Post grunge"
50:46;50:47;"Post Seattle thing"
50:47;50:48;"Creed was the one"
50:48;50:49;"That sort of triggered my ire"
50:49;50:50;"At that exact point"
50:50;50:51;"But I think there was another band"
50:51;50:52;"Called Godsmack"
50:52;50:53;"That did it a little bit"
50:53;50:54;"But although I may be wrong"
50:54;50:56;"Because I don't own any of their records"
50:56;50:58;"So I can't really say for sure"
50:58;50:59;"But there were other"
50:59;51:01;"I remember tuning in my FM radio"
51:01;51:02;"And hearing other bands"
51:02;51:03;"That were doing it"
51:03;51:04;"And being kind of annoyed"
51:04;51:05;"And you know"
51:05;51:07;"I don't hear it anymore thankfully"
51:07;51:08;"But so as somebody"
51:08;51:09;"Who was actually there"
51:09;51:10;"In Seattle"
51:10;51:12;"Part of this whole world"
51:12;51:13;"When"
51:13;51:14;"Because it was interesting"
51:14;51:15;"In the essay"
51:15;51:16;"You said that"
51:16;51:17;"To you"
51:17;51:18;"Eddie Vedder only yarled"
51:18;51:20;"On the first PJ album"
51:20;51:21;"And you said that"
51:21;51:23;"Cobain never yarled"
51:23;51:24;"Is that still your stance?"
51:24;51:25;"Yes correct"
51:25;51:26;"The way I understand it"
51:26;51:28;"Yes that's exactly right"
51:28;51:29;"Looking backwards"
51:29;51:31;"When I picture"
51:31;51:32;"You know the first time"
51:32;51:33;"I heard Nirvana"
51:33;51:34;"Or Pearl Jam"
51:34;51:35;"It's hard to put your finger on"
51:35;51:36;"What actually connects"
51:36;51:38;"The singing of"
51:38;51:39;"Kurt Cobain"
51:39;51:40;"Eddie Vedder"
51:40;51:41;"Chris Cornell"
51:41;51:42;"They're all so different"
51:42;51:43;"And yet they do feel like"
51:43;51:45;"They have something in common"
51:45;51:46;"And it's not very easy for me"
51:46;51:48;"To find the precedence"
51:48;51:49;"Because like obviously"
51:49;51:50;"A lot of people would say"
51:50;51:51;"Like Jake's uncle"
51:51;51:52;"Often famously said"
51:52;51:54;"Nirvana just a punk band"
51:54;51:56;"And of course you see the way"
51:56;51:57;"That the energy"
51:57;51:58;"And the aesthetics of punk"
51:58;51:59;"Influence Kurt"
51:59;52:00;"It's hard for me to think of"
52:00;52:01;"Like a punk singer"
52:01;52:02;"Before Nirvana"
52:02;52:03;"Who sang like that"
52:03;52:04;"So when you first"
52:04;52:05;"Heard these bands"
52:05;52:06;"No there wasn't any"
52:06;52:07;"Yeah so when you first"
52:07;52:08;"Heard these bands"
52:08;52:09;"Did you already have a feeling"
52:09;52:10;"Of like whoa"
52:10;52:12;"This is a new type of singing?"
52:12;52:13;"Well no"
52:13;52:14;"I mean it's derived"
52:14;52:16;"From 70's hard rock"
52:16;52:18;"Pearl Jam in the early phases"
52:18;52:19;"People used to"
52:19;52:20;"Sort of compare them"
52:20;52:21;"To Bad Company"
52:21;52:22;"And some sometimes"
52:22;52:23;"But the thing is"
52:23;52:24;"All those guys"
52:24;52:25;"Well at least Kurt"
52:25;52:26;"And you know"
52:26;52:27;"Lane Staley"
52:27;52:28;"And Eddie"
52:28;52:29;"They all have sort of"
52:29;52:31;"Gravely mid-range voices"
52:31;52:32;"You know"
52:32;52:33;"Not your Geddy Lee"
52:33;52:34;"Kind of high singing"
52:34;52:35;"Kind of thing"
52:35;52:36;"Right"
52:36;52:37;"But you know"
52:37;52:38;"So we didn't really have"
52:38;52:40;"The stereotypical metal screamer"
52:40;52:42;"Was not really a thing"
52:42;52:43;"Here in Seattle"
52:43;52:44;"But Mel could do that"
52:44;52:45;"If he wanted to"
52:45;52:46;"You've heard me on"
52:46;52:47;"You know"
52:47;52:49;"On Ultra Mega OK"
52:49;52:50;"Where he actually"
52:50;52:51;"Hits his high register"
52:51;52:52;"But that wasn't"
52:52;52:53;"You know in general"
52:53;52:54;"He didn't do that"
52:54;52:55;"On that many songs"
52:55;52:56;"He generally sang"
52:56;52:57;"In his lower range"
52:57;52:58;"A lot of the time"
52:58;52:59;"So you know"
52:59;53:00;"The y'all thing is just"
53:00;53:01;"It's a mannerism"
53:01;53:02;"It's not about"
53:02;53:03;"The tone of the voice"
53:03;53:06;"It's about the way you"
53:06;53:07;"Make the letter R"
53:07;53:08;"You know"
53:08;53:09;"And the way you"
53:09;53:10;"The way you curl the lip"
53:10;53:11;"A certain way"
53:11;53:13;"And it's a little hammy"
53:13;53:14;"It has to be said"
53:14;53:15;"And I don't think"
53:15;53:16;"Kurt ever had that"
53:16;53:18;"He was kind of his own deal"
53:19;53:22;"I meet an easy friend"
53:22;53:23;"I do"
53:23;53:26;"With a ear to lend"
53:26;53:27;"I do"
53:27;53:29;"Think you fit this shoe"
53:29;53:30;"I do"
53:30;53:33;"But you have a clue"
53:33;53:36;"And I take advantage"
53:36;53:40;"While you hang me out to dry"
53:40;53:43;"But I can't see you"
53:43;53:44;"Every night"
53:44;53:45;"Free"
53:45;53:46;"It's interesting"
53:46;53:47;"That you're like"
53:47;53:48;"Bringing it back to"
53:48;53:49;"70s rock"
53:49;53:50;"As being the origin"
53:50;53:51;"I'm just curious"
53:51;53:52;"Just as you"
53:52;53:53;"You know"
53:53;53:54;"Being a producer"
53:54;53:55;"And musician at that time"
53:55;53:56;"And Jake"
53:56;53:57;"You're a Gen X expert"
53:57;53:59;"You might have some opinions"
53:59;54:00;"I guess for me"
54:00;54:02;"And this goes beyond Yarling"
54:02;54:03;"As someone who was like"
54:03;54:04;"I was young"
54:04;54:05;"But you know"
54:05;54:06;"I was following those bands"
54:06;54:08;"As a kid in the 90s"
54:08;54:09;"I guess the interesting thing"
54:09;54:10;"About grunge to me"
54:10;54:12;"When I was kind of taking in"
54:12;54:13;"All these images"
54:13;54:14;"Was like"
54:14;54:15;"I always thought"
54:15;54:16;"Of punk rock"
54:16;54:18;"And 70s hard rock"
54:18;54:19;"As being like"
54:19;54:21;"Opposite ends of the spectrum"
54:21;54:22;"You know what I mean?"
54:22;54:23;"Like bad company"
54:23;54:24;"Very under"
54:24;54:25;"They were"
54:25;54:26;"So then it's interesting to me"
54:26;54:27;"Until grunge"
54:27;54:28;"I was always confused about grunge"
54:28;54:29;"Yeah so to you"
54:29;54:30;"Grunge is like a synthesis"
54:30;54:31;"Because I remember being a kid"
54:31;54:32;"And I'd be like"
54:32;54:33;"You know"
54:33;54:34;"Listen to Pearl Jam"
54:34;54:35;"And Soundgarden"
54:35;54:36;"I'd be like"
54:36;54:37;"Yeah this sounds like rock"
54:37;54:38;"Like 70s rock"
54:38;54:39;"And then you'd see like"
54:39;54:41;"People describing Nirvana"
54:41;54:43;"As being like a punk band"
54:43;54:44;"And there was that movie"
54:44;54:46;"That 1991 the year punk broke"
54:46;54:47;"Only people who've never heard punk"
54:47;54:48;"Would say that"
54:48;54:49;"Right"
54:49;54:50;"It's like people's idea"
54:50;54:52;"Of what punk must have been like"
54:52;54:54;"And it's nonsense"
54:54;54:55;"Right so you felt like"
54:55;54:56;"The whole grunge movement"
54:56;54:57;"Was almost like"
54:57;54:59;"The end of punk"
54:59;55:00;"Like a return to just like"
55:00;55:02;"Big 70s rock"
55:02;55:03;"I think it was kind of"
55:03;55:04;"It took a"
55:04;55:06;"There was a branch of 70s hard rock"
55:06;55:07;"That kind of petered out"
55:07;55:09;"Around 1975, 76"
55:09;55:11;"And was displaced"
55:11;55:12;"By punk rock"
55:12;55:13;"And disco"
55:13;55:14;"And electronica"
55:14;55:16;"And all these other sort of styles"
55:16;55:18;"Came about at the end of the 70s"
55:18;55:20;"And that led to the new wave"
55:20;55:21;"Of heavy metal"
55:21;55:22;"And all this other stuff"
55:22;55:24;"So the grunge thing"
55:24;55:25;"Was kind of going back"
55:25;55:27;"To a sort of a 70s aesthetic"
55:27;55:28;"With the riffs"
55:28;55:29;"Okay because you'll notice"
55:29;55:30;"A lot of the grunge stuff"
55:30;55:32;"Is riff rock"
55:32;55:34;"It's got big fat riffs in it"
55:34;55:35;"Okay"
55:35;55:36;"But the attitude"
55:36;55:38;"And the aesthetic of it"
55:38;55:40;"Like the stance if you will"
55:40;55:41;"Was very punk rock"
55:41;55:43;"Like these were people"
55:43;55:44;"Who had grown up listening"
55:44;55:45;"To their big brothers"
55:45;55:46;"Zeo Zeppelin"
55:46;55:47;"And Black Sabbath records"
55:47;55:48;"But they'd also listen"
55:48;55:49;"To Black Flag"
55:49;55:50;"And the Dead Kennedys"
55:50;55:51;"And so"
55:51;55:52;"You don't get"
55:52;55:53;"The wheels and rainbows"
55:53;55:55;"Kind of lyrics"
55:55;55:56;"Instead you get"
55:56;55:57;"You know"
55:57;55:58;"You get Grandma Take Me Home"
55:58;55:59;"And I'm a Negative Kreef"
55:59;56:00;"And so it's kind of like"
56:00;56:01;"Punk aesthetic grafted"
56:01;56:03;"On to 70s riff rock"
56:03;56:04;"That was the early"
56:04;56:06;"Grunge stuff to me"
56:06;56:07;"I mean if you listen to Bleach"
56:07;56:09;"I mean Negative Kreef"
56:09;56:10;"Is kind of communication"
56:10;56:12;"Breakdown if you think about it"
56:12;56:13;"Yeah that's a great way"
56:13;56:14;"To put it"
56:14;56:15;"Cause I mean yeah"
56:15;56:16;"I imagine Jake for you"
56:16;56:17;"It's like kind of obvious"
56:17;56:18;"But for me"
56:18;56:19;"I was always kind of like"
56:19;56:20;"Yeah the punk and the hard rock"
56:20;56:21;"And yeah maybe it is"
56:21;56:23;"The music is hard riff rock"
56:23;56:24;"But the themes"
56:24;56:25;"And the lyrics"
56:25;56:27;"Are way more in that punk vein"
56:27;56:29;"And thematically"
56:29;56:30;"Like you said"
56:30;56:31;"Exactly"
56:31;56:32;"They're much more"
56:32;56:33;"Sort of timely"
56:33;56:34;"Exactly"
56:34;56:35;"I mean I've taken"
56:35;56:36;"This analogy further"
56:36;56:37;"Think of"
56:37;56:38;"Smashing Pumpkins"
56:38;56:39;"Now think of ELO"
56:39;56:40;"Right"
56:40;56:41;"Think of Dinosaur Junior"
56:41;56:42;"And think of Electric Hot Tuna"
56:42;56:43;"Nobody's gonna get that"
56:43;56:44;"That's obscure"
56:44;56:45;"But I mean"
56:45;56:47;"It's like for a lot of those bands"
56:47;56:48;"I can think of like"
56:48;56:50;"Sort of analogous bands"
56:50;56:51;"From the 70s"
56:51;56:52;"That had similar styles"
56:52;56:53;"You know"
56:53;56:54;"And then everybody"
56:54;56:55;"Seemed to look back at"
56:55;56:56;"Aerosmith and Zeppelin and Sabbath"
56:56;56:57;"To some extent"
56:57;56:58;"As well as the punk stuff"
56:58;56:59;"Right"
56:59;57:00;"One question that we had"
57:00;57:02;"Just because we've been talking about"
57:02;57:04;"A lot of the iconic grunge bands"
57:04;57:05;"Have male singers"
57:05;57:07;"But our guy Seinfeld 2000"
57:07;57:08;"Also on the show"
57:08;57:10;"He had an interesting question"
57:10;57:12;"Can women yarl?"
57:12;57:13;"You know"
57:13;57:14;"I don't see why they can't"
57:14;57:16;"I can't think of any that did"
57:16;57:18;"Maybe because they tend to have"
57:18;57:19;"Higher pitched voices"
57:19;57:20;"But I can't think of any that did"
57:20;57:22;"And you can probably think of some"
57:22;57:23;"But offhand"
57:23;57:24;"I'm thinking of like"
57:24;57:26;"Babes in Toyland and L7"
57:26;57:28;"Which were two bands of that era"
57:28;57:29;"That I worked with"
57:29;57:30;"And you certainly couldn't say that yarl"
57:30;57:32;"Did Alanis Morissette yarl?"
57:32;57:33;"Well"
57:33;57:35;"I never really listened to her"
57:35;57:37;"So I can't tell you"
57:37;57:38;"Did she?"
57:38;57:40;"I mean she had a very specific"
57:40;57:42;"Thing going on"
57:42;57:44;"Did Alanis Morissette yarl?"
57:44;57:45;"Hard to say"
57:45;57:47;"Let's listen to the beginning of"
57:47;57:48;"You Oughta Know"
57:48;57:49;"And Jack"
57:49;57:50;"Hopefully as you listen"
57:50;57:53;"As you listen to a low quality stream"
57:53;57:55;"Of this song through your phone"
57:55;57:56;"You get enough information"
57:56;57:58;"To determine if she's yarling"
57:58;58:01;"Am I the one making this determination?"
58:01;58:03;"I feel responsibility is heavy"
58:03;58:05;"Heavy on my shoulders here"
58:05;58:06;"Yes"
58:06;58:07;"We'll proceed"
58:07;58:11;"I want you to know"
58:11;58:16;"That I'm happy for you"
58:16;58:20;"I wish nothing but"
58:20;58:24;"The best for you both"
58:24;58:26;"I know the version of me"
58:26;58:29;"Is she perverted like me?"
58:29;58:33;"Would she go down on you in a theater?"
58:33;58:35;"Does she speak Araquanese?"
58:35;58:37;"And would she have your baby?"
58:37;58:42;"I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother"
58:42;58:44;"'Cause the love that you gave her"
58:44;58:46;"We made wasn't able to make it"
58:46;58:49;"Enough for you to really open wide"
58:49;58:51;"No"
58:51;58:54;"And every time you speak her name"
58:54;58:56;"Does she know how you told me it'd help me?"
58:56;58:58;"Until you died, until you died"
58:58;59:00;"But you're still alive"
59:00;59:02;"And I'm here"
59:03;59:05;"To remind you"
59:05;59:07;"Of the mess you left"
59:07;59:09;"When you went away"
59:09;59:12;"It's not fair"
59:12;59:14;"To deny me"
59:14;59:18;"Of the crazy love that you gave me"
59:18;59:22;"I don't know"
59:22;59:25;"You're the one that I love"
59:25;59:28;"And I'm the one that you love"
59:28;59:32;"And I'm the one that you love"
01:00:29;01:00:33;"I was kind of in the engine watching it change, you know what I mean?"
01:00:33;01:00:37;"The USS Grunge was kind of like getting up to full speed"
01:00:37;01:00:42;"And it was kind of disturbing watching it sort of be co-opted"
01:00:42;01:00:46;"And adopted by the mainstream and mutated thereby"
01:00:46;01:00:50;"You know, by '94, '95, the thing had pretty much run its course"
01:00:50;01:00:54;"And we ran into the next thing, which was at the time it was Britpop"
01:00:54;01:01:00;"And then there was New Metal with, you know, Fred Burst and his buddies and porn and so forth"
01:01:00;01:01:07;"And then by the end of the '90s there was sort of a resurgence of rock and roll bands here in Seattle at least"
01:01:07;01:01:12;"And I found myself working on records for Zem Gorilla and The Makers and Zeke"
01:01:12;01:01:17;"And the Murder City Devils and just a bunch of great bands that kind of came back around again"
01:01:17;01:01:21;"At the end of the '90s that were not grunge bands, no way, no how"
01:01:21;01:01:25;"And that led me to where I am today, I'm still recording bands pretty much full on"
01:01:25;01:01:28;"Not so many in the COVID era, but a lot of mixing and mastering"
01:01:28;01:01:31;"But at the time, you know, the '90s were strange"
01:01:31;01:01:35;"When grunge kind of exploded and splattered on everybody's windshield there"
01:01:35;01:01:39;"I started taking production gigs in foreign countries as much as I could"
01:01:39;01:01:43;"Because I was getting the offers and I wanted to travel"
01:01:43;01:01:50;"So I ended up making weird, obscure indie records in, you know, to date, 14 other countries"
01:01:50;01:01:55;"I'm not sure how much they helped my career, but they helped my view of the world out a great deal"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"And you're still in Seattle?"
01:01:57;01:01:58;"Oh yeah"
01:01:58;01:02:03;"You've been based in Seattle most of your life, although we see you're originally from Connecticut, same place Jake's from"
01:02:03;01:02:08;"Originally from Connecticut, yeah, moved out here in '74, pretty much never looked back"
01:02:08;01:02:12;"One thing we've talked about on this show is Jake's made the point over and over again"
01:02:12;01:02:15;"I don't necessarily agree, but he's from Connecticut, he can say it"
01:02:15;01:02:18;"That he believes Connecticut's not pulling its weight musically"
01:02:18;01:02:21;"Is that something that's been on your mind at all?"
01:02:21;01:02:24;"Is that why you kind of ride more for Seattle?"
01:02:24;01:02:29;"I was pretty darn young when I left Connecticut, so it's hard for me to judge really"
01:02:29;01:02:32;"I haven't been back other than a few times during tours"
01:02:32;01:02:37;"But, you know, I will say that back when my band Skinyard was touring"
01:02:37;01:02:42;"I think we only played a show once in Connecticut the whole time we were together"
01:02:42;01:02:47;"There didn't seem to be much of a scene there going on, at least in the late '80s and early '90s"
01:02:47;01:02:52;"Connecticut was like, you drove through it between your gig in New York and your gig in Boston"
01:02:52;01:02:56;"You know, it was kind of, you know, oh there's Highway 84"
01:02:56;01:03:00;"And I still don't really hear, where's the music scene?"
01:03:00;01:03:03;"Is there one, are there clubs, are there bands? There must be"
01:03:03;01:03:06;"Do they move to New York? What do they do?"
01:03:06;01:03:09;"Yeah, I guess it's because people tend to leave"
01:03:09;01:03:13;"But there's definitely great bands there, and then of course there's people from Connecticut"
01:03:13;01:03:19;"Like a Rivers Cuomo, or a John Mayer, a Michael Bolton"
01:03:19;01:03:24;"Jake's brother, Dave, has a band, Dirty Projectors, great band"
01:03:24;01:03:26;"But again, not a Connecticut-based band, just"
01:03:26;01:03:30;"It's come up so much because there's so many legendary acts from New Jersey"
01:03:30;01:03:34;"If you're talking about the New York tri-state area, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York"
01:03:34;01:03:41;"New York and New Jersey are really like, producing historic, iconic acts"
01:03:41;01:03:46;"It's true, Connecticut and Rhode Island are kind of, you're right, they're not pulling their weight really, such as it is"
01:03:46;01:03:50;"And at least Rhode Island has the excuse of being like, the smallest state"
01:03:50;01:03:54;"So Connecticut, it's, you know, it's a great state though"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"I'm a fan"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"No comment"
01:03:58;01:04:05;"This is rare that we have two people born in Connecticut on the show at the same time"
01:04:05;01:04:08;"What town are you from in Connecticut?"
01:04:08;01:04:10;"Southbury"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"Wait, wait, wait, hold on"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"You're from Southbury?"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"Correct"
01:04:16;01:04:17;"That's where I'm from"
01:04:17;01:04:18;"Seriously?"
01:04:18;01:04:20;"I'm dead serious"
01:04:20;01:04:21;"Born and raised"
01:04:21;01:04:22;"That's amazing"
01:04:22;01:04:23;"Pettletown Road"
01:04:23;01:04:24;"Know it well"
01:04:24;01:04:27;"So, you left Southbury in '74?"
01:04:27;01:04:28;"Correct"
01:04:28;01:04:32;"I was born in '77, so we did not cross paths, but um"
01:04:32;01:04:35;"No, our lives did not intersect"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"That's unbelievable"
01:04:37;01:04:43;"This is a great connection we just made, because also, I'm picturing Jake, a big rock fan"
01:04:43;01:04:52;"I'm sure in the early 90's, you're probably listening to Bleach, having no idea that it was produced by a Southbury native"
01:04:52;01:04:53;"No idea"
01:04:53;01:04:54;"That's kind of weird"
01:04:54;01:04:58;"I don't hear about Southbury, Connecticut very often, you know"
01:04:58;01:05:01;"Which, not surprisingly"
01:05:01;01:05:08;"The year I left, I've been to high school, the high school was so underfunded that they were going on some kind of double sessions the year after I left"
01:05:08;01:05:10;"The politics of that town were very weird"
01:05:10;01:05:13;"It's a real, like, kind of Republican town, still is"
01:05:13;01:05:17;"Heritage Village in the middle of town was just getting bigger and bigger, I remember"
01:05:17;01:05:18;"Sure"
01:05:18;01:05:20;"So, was, sorry, this is so deep"
01:05:20;01:05:23;"Was it Pomparog High School in the 70's?"
01:05:23;01:05:27;"Pomparog, no, it was, let me think, it was just called Southbury High School"
01:05:27;01:05:29;"Pomparog was the grade school, if I remember right"
01:05:29;01:05:30;"Yeah, I went there"
01:05:30;01:05:33;"No, that was Rochambeau, actually, was the grade school"
01:05:33;01:05:37;"It was Pomparog Elementary and Rochambeau Middle School, I went to both of those"
01:05:37;01:05:42;"Correct, yes, and then SHS was the high school, yeah, that is kind of terrifying"
01:05:42;01:05:45;"Now, don't bring me back to these thoughts, actually"
01:05:45;01:05:47;"Okay, we can move on, we can move on, it's just"
01:05:47;01:05:51;"I mean, let's move on from this, sorry everybody listening to this, it's like, they're not themselves"
01:05:51;01:05:55;"No, no, this is what the fans want to listen to, this is what this show is all about"
01:05:55;01:05:58;"Okay, but we'll stop asking you Connecticut questions"
01:05:58;01:06:02;"It's freaky because I never run into anyone from Southbury, ever"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"It's very weird"
01:06:04;01:06:05;"Wow"
01:06:05;01:06:12;"I love the image though of young Jake listening to Bleach, having no idea that it's in any way connected to Southbury, Connecticut"
01:06:12;01:06:13;"Yeah"
01:06:13;01:06:18;"Now, Jake, this might be something else that you don't want to talk about, and it's fair if you don't"
01:06:18;01:06:20;"On this show we talk about the Grateful Dead a lot"
01:06:20;01:06:29;"And I'm just curious, when you're talking about the influence of 70s hard rock in the Seattle scene"
01:06:29;01:06:36;"And I'm just picturing you working with Nirvana, playing in bands, knowing all these people in that world"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"Were there a bunch of deadheads?"
01:06:38;01:06:42;"Because we kind of got the impression that Kurt was like very anti the dead"
01:06:42;01:06:45;"Was the dead unpopular in that scene?"
01:06:45;01:06:47;"Were they considered passé at the time?"
01:06:47;01:06:48;"Do you have a take?"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"Were there any connections there?"
01:06:50;01:06:55;"You know, this is funny because among people that I play in bands with now"
01:06:55;01:06:58;"Who are almost entirely 10 or 15 years younger than I am"
01:06:58;01:07:02;"I can think of several deadheads of the younger generations"
01:07:02;01:07:07;"And in the grunge years, even though I was slightly older than most of my clients"
01:07:07;01:07:08;"Only by a couple of years"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"I didn't mention the Grateful Dead to anybody"
01:07:10;01:07:13;"I saw the Grateful Dead a couple of times back in the day"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"And they're a part of my record collection"
01:07:15;01:07:21;"I mean, I've got a stack of like, you know, a couple dozen dead records next to the Black Sabbath albums"
01:07:21;01:07:24;"And the Grand Hogs records and the Hawkwind records"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"I was kind of a big dead fan"
01:07:26;01:07:32;"I mean, there's a time and a place when, you know, I really enjoy listening to some of their records"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"Blue Sparrow was a big favorite of mine"
01:07:34;01:07:35;"Oh, absolutely"
01:07:35;01:07:40;"I don't think the dead were really on anybody's radar that much back in the grunge era, really"
01:07:40;01:07:46;"But I always appreciated them because I think improvisation is an important part of rock music"
01:07:46;01:07:48;"And I have to say that I have an improv band now"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"It's called Beyond Captain Orca"
01:07:50;01:07:53;"We have a band campsite because it's a three-piece"
01:07:53;01:07:57;"I play guitar, I have a drummer and a bass player who are younger than I am"
01:07:57;01:08:02;"But they're both kind of into a lot of jazz and dead and improv stuff"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"And we improvise"
01:08:04;01:08:07;"Basically, the three of us get on stage and we improvise for a half an hour"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"And we record every show"
01:08:09;01:08:12;"And we've been doing it for about four years now"
01:08:12;01:08:16;"And when I can, I bring my full Pro Tools rig and record it multi-track and mix it down"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"And we put it up on our band campsite"
01:08:18;01:08:19;"Oh, awesome"
01:08:19;01:08:22;"Every show is different because we have no songs and no singer"
01:08:22;01:08:25;"And no rehearsal and no overhead as a band"
01:08:25;01:08:27;"I think it's the band of the future"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"We don't have to rehearse"
01:08:29;01:08:31;"You know, it's pure improv"
01:08:31;01:08:35;"And we kind of get away with it because we're reasonably good at it"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"Because it can be really bad if you don't know what you're doing"
01:08:37;01:08:38;"Yeah, that's a great model"
01:08:38;01:08:44;"Yeah, I mean, it's a terrifying thing to improvise and actually hold an audience's attention"
01:08:44;01:08:47;"But we've been able to pull it off"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"But, you know, anybody who wants to can check it out"
01:08:49;01:08:54;"But it's a very timely question because now I'm playing with people much younger than I am"
01:08:54;01:09:00;"And I can talk about the dead and they all immediately go, ""Oh yeah, you know, New Jersey, July 7th, 1974"""
01:09:00;01:09:02;"You know what I mean? I'm like, ""What? Really?"""
01:09:02;01:09:07;"I mean, some of these people are really, really into it because all of it's up on the web now"
01:09:07;01:09:12;"Right, but by contrast, kind of peak grunge era Seattle"
01:09:12;01:09:15;"You kind of had to keep your dead fandom a little quiet"
01:09:15;01:09:18;"It just wasn't a fashionable... nobody was interested in talking about it"
01:09:18;01:09:21;"Oh, I'd get excoriated for it back there, are you kidding?"
01:09:21;01:09:24;"Well, there's a lot of uncool music in everybody's record collection"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"And I certainly have my share of it"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"But it's like funny in a weird way"
01:09:28;01:09:29;"I guess this is always what happens"
01:09:29;01:09:34;"It's like a younger generation, it's harder to understand the biases of a previous one"
01:09:34;01:09:37;"Because obviously the dead had so much music"
01:09:37;01:09:40;"But every big grunge band, Nirvana included"
01:09:40;01:09:44;"You could picture a dead record or an era that they'd probably be into"
01:09:44;01:09:48;"You know, like why wouldn't Kurt be into live dead?"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"You know, like the late 60s stuff or something"
01:09:50;01:09:53;"You know, it doesn't seem that different"
01:09:53;01:09:57;"You would think that as one of the... such an iconic American band"
01:09:57;01:10:00;"That they would have been a little more fashionable"
01:10:00;01:10:04;"With like this kind of back to basics era of like rock music"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"Well, listen, I don't think he lived long enough"
01:10:06;01:10:09;"I mean, look at... unplugged MTV, unplugged, okay?"
01:10:09;01:10:13;"And now look at, you know, American Beauty or Working Man's Dead or something"
01:10:13;01:10:16;"I mean, it's about a song, playing a song with a guitar"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"I mean, Dylan did that even"
01:10:18;01:10:21;"For that matter, the dead covered Dylan a few times"
01:10:21;01:10:23;"So, you know, it's not that big a stretch"
01:10:23;01:10:26;"He probably just was... probably in a few more years"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"He would have eventually discovered them and thought"
01:10:28;01:10:31;"""Oh, okay, this is actually pretty cool, now I get it"""
01:10:31;01:10:33;"Well, maybe it was like a hippie thing"
01:10:33;01:10:37;"I have a sense that like the musicians of that era were like"
01:10:37;01:10:46;"Super anti-hippie and super anti-Baby Boomer 60s idealism or mythology"
01:10:46;01:10:49;"Yeah, I think you're right, grunge was pretty nihilistic at the time"
01:10:49;01:10:53;"Absolutely, and I think that's a good point about Kurt specifically"
01:10:53;01:10:56;"That obviously tragically dying so young"
01:10:56;01:10:59;"When you watch interviews with him, he actually..."
01:10:59;01:11:02;"Even though he would occasionally say some spicy stuff here and there"
01:11:02;01:11:05;"From what I understand specifically about the dead"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"He actually seemed like very open-minded"
01:11:07;01:11:10;"I watched an interview recently with him"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"Where they asked him about Madonna"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"And it was kind of like a loaded question"
01:11:14;01:11:15;"The interviewer was saying like"
01:11:15;01:11:20;"""Hey Kurt, did you hear that Madonna's trying to sign grunge bands now to her record label?"""
01:11:20;01:11:22;"Because I think they probably wanted him to say"
01:11:22;01:11:25;"""Oh my God, that's so f***ed up, that's so lame"""
01:11:25;01:11:27;"""What a sellout"""
01:11:27;01:11:29;"He was actually very thoughtful about it"
01:11:29;01:11:34;"He was like ""Well, in her own way, Madonna is a very interesting artist"""
01:11:34;01:11:38;"""And it doesn't surprise me that she'd have her finger on the pulse"""
01:11:38;01:11:40;"He didn't totally give it up for her"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"But he didn't take the bait to trash her"
01:11:42;01:11:43;"He was like..."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"And also he was very familiar with her work"
01:11:45;01:11:50;"He was like ""Well, you know, you look at how she was influenced by voguing"""
01:11:50;01:11:52;"""A gay subculture from New York"""
01:11:52;01:11:55;"And he just knew about her career"
01:11:55;01:11:58;"So I could totally picture, I think that's a good point"
01:11:58;01:12:01;"Look at MTV Unplugged"
01:12:01;01:12:05;"You could totally see a 30-something Kurt"
01:12:05;01:12:07;"Getting deep into American beauty"
01:12:07;01:12:08;"And doing an interview"
01:12:08;01:12:11;"And be like ""Yeah, I used to slam the dead a little bit"""
01:12:11;01:12:15;"""When I was kind of young, kind of like an angry punk rocker"""
01:12:15;01:12:18;"""But actually now I see the ways in which the dead are kind of punk"""
01:12:18;01:12:20;"I could totally see that happening"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"Yeah, and listen"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"You know, one of Kurt's favorite bands was Flipper"
01:12:23;01:12:26;"And Flipper is a very, very noisy band"
01:12:26;01:12:31;"And there's definitely an element of chaos and looseness in improvisation"
01:12:31;01:12:34;"Embedded in most of their best songs"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"It's not their biggest stretch"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"The other thing I'm going to point out that you should think about"
01:12:38;01:12:41;"And that's the business model of Pearl Jam"
01:12:41;01:12:45;"So Pearl Jam has maintained their own control over their catalog"
01:12:45;01:12:47;"They've got their own mail order"
01:12:47;01:12:49;"They've got their fan club"
01:12:49;01:12:50;"You know, for a while"
01:12:50;01:12:51;"And maybe they still do this"
01:12:51;01:12:52;"I don't know, they're not touring now obviously"
01:12:52;01:12:55;"But they were recording every show"
01:12:55;01:12:56;"And making it available"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"A recording, multi-track"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"Available for fans to buy"
01:13:00;01:13:03;"Well, okay, think of Grateful Dead and their entire"
01:13:03;01:13:07;"The GDN, I mean the whole Grateful Dead merchandising"
01:13:07;01:13:10;"The stuff from the vault that they always sell"
01:13:10;01:13:14;"I mean all of the limited edition live recordings that they make available"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"Pearl Jam ended up"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"I don't know if this was on purpose or not"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"But they ended up sort of following"
01:13:20;01:13:23;"The Grateful Dead's business model"
01:13:23;01:13:27;"Of giving the fans as much as they want"
01:13:27;01:13:31;"And not having to run all of it through the major label pipeline if you will"
01:13:31;01:13:32;"Right, yeah"
01:13:32;01:13:36;"Lone, listless"
01:13:36;01:13:41;"Breakfast table and otherwise empty room"
01:13:41;01:13:46;"Comfort room, my own room"
01:13:46;01:13:49;"The center of all the physical"
01:13:49;01:13:52;"No more worries and laughter"
01:13:52;01:13:55;"Tries to understand it"
01:13:55;01:13:59;"Tries to make her proud"
01:13:59;01:14:04;"The shades go down and set her hair"
01:14:04;01:14:09;"Painted with gold and in her hair"
01:14:09;01:14:13;"Sorted from the party go"
01:14:13;01:14:15;"I'll pay the bill"
01:14:15;01:14:19;"The paycheck kept with her hair"
01:14:19;01:14:22;"I'll pay the bill"
01:14:25;01:14:30;"The paycheck kept with her hair"
01:14:30;01:14:32;"Don't know me"
01:14:32;01:14:35;"I just gotta ask you just cause it's the type of thing we talked about on the show a lot"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"Which is Starbucks and in fact"
01:14:37;01:14:40;"One of our long time friends of the show"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"Invented Starbucking"
01:14:42;01:14:46;"He actually recently went to his 16,000th Starbucks"
01:14:46;01:14:50;"He's been trying to hit every Starbucks in the world since the 90s"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"But so I'm just curious about"
01:14:52;01:14:55;"You know take us back to like 80s Seattle"
01:14:55;01:14:58;"How familiar were you with that like original Starbucks?"
01:14:58;01:15:01;"Like before it exploded in the 90s"
01:15:01;01:15:02;"Were you hitting it?"
01:15:02;01:15:05;"No, in fact I just gave up coffee about a week ago"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"We'll see if it sticks"
01:15:07;01:15:08;"A week ago?"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"Yeah"
01:15:09;01:15:12;"Now you know what I didn't start drinking coffee until I was 50 years old"
01:15:12;01:15:13;"That's the funny thing"
01:15:13;01:15:15;"Coffee was not even on my radar"
01:15:15;01:15:19;"Even with this whole like Seattle coffee thing"
01:15:19;01:15:21;"You were there for like all those years"
01:15:21;01:15:26;"And you never started slamming coffee brews?"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"I really didn't give a damn about coffee"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"I just did not drink coffee"
01:15:30;01:15:33;"But you know there was that store down in Pioneer Square"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"The original Starbucks store"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"I think it was there for quite a long time"
01:15:37;01:15:38;"I could be wrong"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"Yeah maybe since the 70s?"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"I mean it was there in the 70s"
01:15:42;01:15:47;"And when did they suddenly become a giant global mega corporation?"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"I mean it didn't happen overnight"
01:15:49;01:15:50;"Right, 90s"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"You know I mean there may have been quite a few years"
01:15:52;01:15:53;"When that was the only store"
01:15:53;01:15:55;"I don't actually know the history of it"
01:15:55;01:15:58;"But I'm not sure exactly when the coffee thing took off"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"I mean now there's you know"
01:16:00;01:16:03;"Seattle is like wildly over served with coffee shops"
01:16:03;01:16:05;"And not just Starbucks"
01:16:05;01:16:08;"I don't know I can't really speak to the Starbucks thing really"
01:16:08;01:16:13;"You know this seemed to be more of a beer and pot tune to me during the grunge years"
01:16:13;01:16:14;"Interesting"
01:16:14;01:16:17;"Can I ask just to end with a sort of a Herm Yall question"
01:16:17;01:16:23;"Wondering if Jake who has created this proto Herm Yall playlist"
01:16:23;01:16:24;"Of bands that may lean in"
01:16:24;01:16:29;"Was there anyone that you wanted to sort of check with the master here?"
01:16:29;01:16:31;"Or anyone you maybe were on the fence with?"
01:16:31;01:16:32;"Oh yeah that's a great question"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"Read it down to me and let me see if I"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"I may not have heard all of it so"
01:16:36;01:16:39;"Okay well keep in mind this is Herm Yall origins"
01:16:39;01:16:41;"So it's all pre-grunge"
01:16:41;01:16:44;"It's all music that came out before 10"
01:16:44;01:16:47;"I kind of expanded the parameters a little bit"
01:16:47;01:16:51;"I have Green River by Creedence Clearwater Revival on there"
01:16:51;01:16:56;"Yeah take me down down world"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"Well maybe maybe sure"
01:16:58;01:17:01;"I got a Something in the Night by Bruce Springsteen"
01:17:01;01:17:03;"I don't know that one"
01:17:03;01:17:05;"Hand Me Down World by the Guess Who"
01:17:05;01:17:08;"Yeah Burton Cummings for sure"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"I have Bargain by The Who"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"I think Daltrey has a lot of"
01:17:12;01:17:15;"If he wants I mean Daltrey can be really sweet"
01:17:15;01:17:16;"Call that a bargain"
01:17:16;01:17:20;"Yep he's got a little of that twang sometimes in his voice"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"Listen we can"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"We can bond over this"
01:17:24;01:17:26;"I'm a huge Who fan okay"
01:17:26;01:17:27;"Oh hell yeah"
01:17:27;01:17:29;"It's funny I know people who are both"
01:17:29;01:17:30;"Dead fans and Who fans"
01:17:30;01:17:33;"I'm not sure what the connection is but it is what it is"
01:17:33;01:17:34;"Well you're talking to one"
01:17:34;01:17:35;"I love the Who"
01:17:35;01:17:38;"I got L.A. Woman by the Doors"
01:17:38;01:17:41;"Oh an interesting thought"
01:17:41;01:17:44;"I wouldn't call it yarling but he's definitely in that sort of"
01:17:44;01:17:47;"Hammy kind of mid-range register there"
01:17:47;01:17:48;"So yeah maybe so"
01:17:48;01:17:49;"Okay Progenitor sure"
01:17:49;01:17:53;"I got Easy Wind sung by Pigpen of the Grateful Dead"
01:17:53;01:17:55;"Easy Wind"
01:17:55;01:17:58;"Oh yeah yeah good one that's a good one"
01:17:58;01:17:59;"You got me on that"
01:17:59;01:18:00;"Nice"
01:18:00;01:18:01;"That's a good choice"
01:18:01;01:18:03;"I know that song that is a good choice"
01:18:03;01:18:05;"I take my hat off to you there"
01:18:05;01:18:08;"And then I got one that I put it out on Twitter today"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"And someone suggested this"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"And I thought it was an interesting call"
01:18:12;01:18:16;"Which would be Injustice For All era Metallica"
01:18:16;01:18:17;"I put on one"
01:18:17;01:18:19;"I think he's got his own thing"
01:18:19;01:18:22;"We need to come up with a different name for what he was doing"
01:18:22;01:18:25;"Because I think he's got his own version of the yarl"
01:18:25;01:18:28;"It deserves its own name"
01:18:28;01:18:29;"So start thinking of one"
01:18:29;01:18:30;"Yeah no I think that's"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"You know that kind of thing where he did ""yeah"""
01:18:32;01:18:34;"You know that uh"
01:18:34;01:18:35;"Yep"
01:18:35;01:18:38;"Where the words ended like this"
01:18:38;01:18:39;"Yeah"
01:18:39;01:18:40;"You know"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"Not exactly yarling"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"But it's something you know"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"Right it's like a cousin"
01:18:46;01:18:47;"Yeah it's a cousin"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"Let's call it a cousin"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"Let's call it a cousin you know"
01:18:51;01:18:53;"The last one I have I think it's really kind of the"
01:18:53;01:18:55;"Like the granddaddy of it all is"
01:18:55;01:18:58;"And I gotta DeVita baby"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"Ooh"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"That's pretty good"
01:19:02;01:19:05;"Yarl won't you come with me"
01:19:05;01:19:06;"Yeah I get it sure"
01:19:06;01:19:07;"I'm with you"
01:19:07;01:19:08;"K"
01:19:08;01:19:09;"You got me on that"
01:19:09;01:19:10;"That's good"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"Well I'm glad you're signing off"
01:19:12;01:19:13;"And then you know what"
01:19:13;01:19:14;"I put down on the last"
01:19:14;01:19:16;"Right at the end of the playlist"
01:19:16;01:19:18;"Something that was contemporary yarl"
01:19:18;01:19:20;"And I think it's my favorite"
01:19:20;01:19:21;"Moment of yarl"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"I put down ""Hunger Strike"""
01:19:23;01:19:25;"Okay listen we gotta be nice to Eddie here"
01:19:25;01:19:26;"And I'll tell you why"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"Because that was like the first thing he"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"That was before the first Pearl Jam record okay"
01:19:30;01:19:31;"It might have got released later"
01:19:31;01:19:33;"I'm not saying this as a negative"
01:19:33;01:19:36;"I think all the music I've listed"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"I like to varying degrees"
01:19:38;01:19:39;"Oh you know what"
01:19:39;01:19:40;"And actually sorry"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"And I love ""Hunger Strike"" it's beautiful"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"My last question is"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"Whatever the origins of the yarl are"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"My personal belief"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"Is that"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"The vast majority of these"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"Post yarl bands"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"That you were talking about the 2000s"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"They were directly to me"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"Copying Eddie in particular"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"Is that fair to say or were they"
01:20:02;01:20:03;"You know what I mean"
01:20:03;01:20:04;"Eddie and Lane"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"Okay Lane didn't yarl that much"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"But they definitely a lot of people"
01:20:08;01:20:09;"Were influenced by the two of those guys"
01:20:09;01:20:11;"Eddie and Lane Staley"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"And maybe a little bit by Grunge Bands"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"Extremely influential singers"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"Do you think Scott Stapp was lifting directly from Vedder"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"I don't know"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"I think he himself probably would argue about that"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"But you know I mean"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"The yarl was definitely there"
01:20:25;01:20:27;"And it wasn't really there in hard rock music"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"Very that much"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"I mean your playlist"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"Despite your playlist"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"The particular extreme style of it of the 90s"
01:20:35;01:20:37;"I mean"
01:20:37;01:20:39;"It was like the people took the Grunge Bands"
01:20:39;01:20:41;"And sort of made sort of cartoon"
01:20:41;01:20:43;"Versions of them"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"And those appeared on the air"
01:20:45;01:20:47;"And we had to sort of listen to these"
01:20:47;01:20:49;"Exaggerated caricatures of the original bands"
01:20:49;01:20:51;"That was what it felt like"
01:20:51;01:20:53;"In the later 90s to me"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"I was like really"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"I'm thinking of the Stone Temple Pilots a little bit"
01:20:57;01:20:59;"But I don't know if what's his name really yarl that much"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"He might have a little bit"
01:21:01;01:21:03;"And I think there's a band called Godsmack"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"That might have done some of it too"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"But again I can't bring a song to mind right now"
01:21:07;01:21:09;"Definitely"
01:21:09;01:21:11;"Jack you've been a great guest"
01:21:11;01:21:13;"Thanks for taking the time"
01:21:13;01:21:15;"Hope you'll come back in the future"
01:21:15;01:21:17;"And check out Jack's music"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"And go check out the original essay"
01:21:19;01:21:21;"It's still up on his website"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"Yeah it's on Indino.com"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"And the music's on JackIndino.bandcamp.com"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"And jeez thanks for letting me plug my own"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"Crap here"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"But you know"
01:21:31;01:21:33;"This is the world we live in you know"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"But it is my pleasure actually"
01:21:35;01:21:37;"So thanks for thinking of me you guys"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"Much appreciated"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"Thanks for coming on man great talking to you"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"And another Southbury resident"
01:21:43;01:21:45;"That's kind of terrifying"
01:21:45;01:21:47;"Amazing"
01:21:47;01:21:49;"I know so I'll just have to think about that for a while"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"Alright you guys"
01:21:51;01:21:53;"Have a good one"
01:21:53;01:21:55;"Bye"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"(Instrumental)"
01:22:25;01:22:27;"Well thank you to"
01:22:27;01:22:29;"Jack Indino"
01:22:29;01:22:31;"Southbury resident up until 74"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"Great guy"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"Check out his music"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"And Seinfeld"
01:22:37;01:22:39;"I can't remember how this came up"
01:22:39;01:22:41;"I don't know if it's because we were talking about"
01:22:41;01:22:43;"Yarling and Seattle"
01:22:43;01:22:45;"But you wanted to do a presentation on"
01:22:45;01:22:47;"The presidents of the United States of America"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"What inspired it?"
01:22:49;01:22:51;"Was it because we have a new president?"
01:22:51;01:22:53;"Yeah you know I'll say that"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"I think about this band maybe about once a year"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"And they popped into my head I think"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"During all this talk of like transition"
01:22:59;01:23:01;"To power and the new president"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"And I just texted the thread and I said"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"I'm surprised that the presidents"
01:23:05;01:23:07;"Of the United States of America"
01:23:07;01:23:09;"The band has never come up on time crisis"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"And that was it"
01:23:11;01:23:13;"Oh yeah and then Jake was like well why"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"You know why are you thinking about them"
01:23:15;01:23:17;"I can't remember but I remember I was like"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"Oh well they were the first compact disc"
01:23:19;01:23:21;"That I ever owned because you know"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"95 I felt like or 96 maybe"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"Was really their year"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"And you know it felt"
01:23:27;01:23:29;"Like an interesting band to talk about"
01:23:29;01:23:31;"And then I started looking into them"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"A little bit and"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"I remember at the time that they were"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"This sort of very funny irreverent band"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"Jake had referenced that like the lead singer"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"Was sort of like had this male"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"Patterned baldness look going on"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"Which was unique but"
01:23:45;01:23:47;"As I was just telling you guys"
01:23:47;01:23:49;"You know kind of off mic"
01:23:49;01:23:51;"You know I realize why"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"They sort of become like a rock footnote"
01:23:53;01:23:55;"Because there isn't really like looking into their"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"Bio as weird as their"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"Name was and how irreverent"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"Their singles at the time seem"
01:24:01;01:24:03;"There isn't really anything"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"Especially interesting about them"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"So you know I talked about"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"Oh maybe we want to listen to Peaches"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"One of their hits I mean throw it on"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"Throw it on"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"They should play a presidential inauguration"
01:24:15;01:24:17;"Sometime"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"So I will say that they actually have"
01:24:19;01:24:21;"Weirdly been politically active"
01:24:21;01:24:23;"They played at a DNC"
01:24:23;01:24:25;"Fundraiser for Clinton in"
01:24:25;01:24:27;"'94 they performed for"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"John Kerry 2004"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"Okay and they did"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"A song about Barack Obama"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"That was released in 2009"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"Whoa I think it's sort of like"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"What do you call it like nomenclative"
01:24:39;01:24:41;"Dissonance when a name determines"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"A certain entities"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"Like course in life"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"I mean that almost sounds like the opposite"
01:24:47;01:24:49;"Of dissonance"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"Consonance"
01:24:51;01:24:53;"Nomenclative consonance"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"Well yeah I've heard people say stuff like that like there's a disproportionate"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"Number of dudes named Dennis who become"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"Dentists"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"Have you heard that?"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"That sounds like the exact type of fact that"
01:25:03;01:25:05;"You could probably is like"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"Maybe just statistical noise"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"Wait I'm curious to hear their songs"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"I haven't heard it in like literally decades"
01:25:13;01:25:15;"Is this Peaches?"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"I mean the big one I think was Lump"
01:25:17;01:25:21;"Well Lump and Peaches were both"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"Massive so it's like"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"Nobody could call them a one hit wonder"
01:25:25;01:25:33;"This is the type of song that I would get"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"So hyped when this would come on"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"The alt rock radio station"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"Totally yeah"
01:25:39;01:25:41;"So it's like I never owned this CD but I would"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"Call myself a fan"
01:25:43;01:25:53;"Sort of a ween vibe"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"Definitely"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"Oh yeah totally"
01:25:57;01:26:03;"I feel like this song"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"It sort of like suggests that there's a deeper meaning to it"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"But it also"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"Is probably just literally about"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"What it's about"
01:26:11;01:26:13;"It seems like a metaphor but it's not"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"Yeah exactly"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"We gotta do a deep dive on this"
01:26:17;01:26:19;"That's such a funny call"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"It seems like there's a metaphor but there's not"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"It's just literally about"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"Eating peaches"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"Gonna eat a lot of peaches"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"I took a little nap"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"With a Roots all twist"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"Squished a rotten peach in my fist"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"And dreamed about you"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"Woman"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"I poke my finger"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"Down inside"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"Make a little room for a hand to hide"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"Nature's candy in my hand"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"Or a can or a pie"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"This part's cool"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"According to Wikipedia"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"The singer Chris Ballew"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"Stated that he wrote"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"Peaches about a girl he once had a crush on"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"Which would almost make you think that it's a"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"Metaphor but then he follows that by saying that"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"He wrote it while sitting under a"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"Peach tree that was in her yard"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"So it's actually just about the peaches"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"Not the girl"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"I feel like I remember hearing something about"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"This band where"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"They only had five strings"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"Where like the bass player just had the"
01:27:41;01:27:43;"Low two strings"
01:27:43;01:27:45;"Strong yes and then"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"The guitar player only played power chords on the top"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"Or the bottom three strings"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"I remember cause they were"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"Called their instruments by funny"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"Names like the bassitar"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"And the"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"I don't know what the other thing would be called"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"Yeah musically they keep"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"Everything very minimal they only have five strings"
01:28:03;01:28:05;"Between bassists Chris Ballew"
01:28:05;01:28:07;"And guitarist Dave"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"Deterer between the two of them"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"So the bass has two strings and the guitar has three strings"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"The synopsis does not go"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"Into those details but I'm assuming"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"Bass has four strings"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"Guitar has one string"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"I'm on some sort of like"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"Forum now"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"Yeah Ballew's instrument has two bass strings"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"Okay so it's two and three"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"Two and three"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"That's tight"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"It's funny I never owned that CD"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"I've never gone deep but"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"I always just felt like"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"I was really hyped about that song"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"And I just always like"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"You know those bands that like"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"You never become an official fan of"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"But you just kind of like"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"Tip of the hat to"
01:28:49;01:28:51;"And so in a sense I was like just"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"Like a real like adjacent fan"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"I was like really glad that they were around"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"And I was always into them"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"I wonder what they're up to these days"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"It looks like they've been releasing records through the 2000s"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"I wonder if they were respected by"
01:29:03;01:29:05;"Their fellow Seattle"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"Cause you know"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"Like Wikipedia says that they're a grunge band"
01:29:09;01:29:11;"They're grunge punk rock"
01:29:11;01:29:13;"Pop punk alternative rock"
01:29:13;01:29:15;"Seems like their sense of humor"
01:29:15;01:29:17;"May be sort of like relegated"
01:29:17;01:29:19;"To like novelty band"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"Territory or something"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"Well they're like right on the edge"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"I was getting like a they might be Giants vibe a little bit"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"Or Nixit"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"Oh yeah I can see that"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"Not grunge, not a grunge band"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"No just a 90s rock band"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"Although it says Kim Thayil"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"Of Soundgarden played on the record"
01:29:37;01:29:39;"Oh really? That's tough"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"I also wonder too"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"This makes me want to go deeper on their discography"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"I wonder if there's like"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"Presence"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"The name is so long"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"It is such a mouthful"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"Do people call them PUSA"
01:29:53;01:29:55;"I've seen that acronym"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"I wonder if there's like some PUSA heads"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"Who are also like you know"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"If they heard somebody being like"
01:30:01;01:30:03;"Yeah you know kind of like sense of humor"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"All you've heard is lump and peaches"
01:30:05;01:30:07;"Get into some of like the later albums"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"I wonder if that's the case"
01:30:09;01:30:11;"There's a deep cut on that album called"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"We're Not Gonna Make It"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"That was very self deprecating"
01:30:15;01:30:17;"I remember that it was like"
01:30:17;01:30:19;"It was all about how they weren't talented at all"
01:30:19;01:30:21;"I remember that as like a 13 year old being like"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Oh these guys are really"
01:30:23;01:30:25;"Taking the b***** out of themselves"
01:30:25;01:30:27;"This is awesome"
01:30:27;01:30:29;"They did have a good sense of humor"
01:30:29;01:30:31;"You know it's funny although I want to say something about Peaches"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"I don't know if the guys in the band"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"Would feel this way"
01:30:35;01:30:37;"But I guess I always thought that the commentary"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"In that song was kind of just like"
01:30:39;01:30:41;"There's that kind of like"
01:30:41;01:30:43;"Mellow A section"
01:30:43;01:30:45;"Move into the country"
01:30:45;01:30:47;"Gonna eat a lot of peaches"
01:30:47;01:30:49;"Which is kind of his fantasy"
01:30:49;01:30:51;"He's gonna get away from the Seattle rat race"
01:30:51;01:30:53;"Go just like chill"
01:30:53;01:30:55;"A lot of people have these fantasies"
01:30:55;01:30:57;"Especially now in the COVID era"
01:30:57;01:30:59;"People want to leave"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"The dense urban centers"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"Go somewhere else"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"Think oh wow I'm gonna have all this space"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"I'm gonna eat fresh peaches all this stuff"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"But then the distortion comes in"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"For the B section"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"The voice kicks up a notch a little like angrier"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"Peaches come from a can"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"They were put there by a man"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"In a factory downtown"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"I mean that right there"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"At least is setting up"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"A dichotomy"
01:31:25;01:31:27;"Where it's like his dream"
01:31:27;01:31:29;"His pastoral dream of eating country peaches"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"Is punctured by the knowledge"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"That actually"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"In today's hyper connected"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"Capitalist world"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"Probably you go try to buy your peach out there in the country"
01:31:39;01:31:41;"And guess what"
01:31:41;01:31:43;"You're gonna get it from a can"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"That was put there by a man in a factory downtown"
01:31:45;01:31:47;"Back in the city"
01:31:47;01:31:49;"So I almost felt like part of the song is like"
01:31:49;01:31:51;"Kind of alternating between daydreaming"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"And like the harsh reality"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"Of like nah man you're never gonna escape downtown"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"So that's my interpretation"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"I love that and then the third part is"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"He has relented"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"And he's accepted his role in this"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"Massive global consumer society"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"And he's just like"
01:32:07;01:32:09;"Millions of peaches"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"Peaches for me"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"I don't understand why they're free"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"Maybe that's just cause it rhymed"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"Peaches are so cheap that they might as well be free maybe"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"I mean maybe it's a comment on like"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"You know"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"Like the peach is the creation of"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"God's bounty"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"And we've devalued it so much"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"In our capitalist world"
01:32:29;01:32:31;"That peaches are basically free"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"Right also how about this"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"I could also see this like because this guy"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"He's alternating between these two extremes"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"The fantasy and then the harsh reality"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"By the third part"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"He snapped"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"And now he's like you know"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"Like barefoot"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"In pioneer square"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"By the starbucks"
01:32:51;01:32:53;"By the lunatic downtown seattle"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"Just like millions of peaches"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"Running up to just like random people"
01:32:57;01:32:59;"Jack and Dino's like walking to the studio"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"And he's like woah"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"Like this dude just like snapped"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"He couldn't balance the contradictions"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"And he became like this kind of like"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"Burned out like street preacher guy"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"The peaches do you understand everybody"
01:33:11;01:33:13;"The peaches are free there's millions of peaches"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"Everywhere you look and you know what they're free"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"And people are just like oh my god"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"You're not far off Ezra"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"You want to read"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"What Matt sent us"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"Well yeah but I think"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"I think Matt is disproving"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"What did Matt send us"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"So this is from 2013"
01:33:31;01:33:33;"This is a conversation between the band"
01:33:33;01:33:35;"Not quite sure who's speaking"
01:33:35;01:33:37;"But this is from the band's point of view"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"I imagine this part is that they're talking to Chris"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"I picture this front yard and I picture you"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"Being otherwise influenced by like"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"Lucy in the sky with diamonds"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"For peaches if you google Marxist interpretation"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"Of peaches up pops this"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"Treatise and somebody has"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"This has been in the internet for years and years"
01:33:53;01:33:55;"It's full of explanations how peaches is an accurate"
01:33:55;01:33:57;"Metaphor for socialism"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"Meanwhile it's a dude that's kind of"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"Wasted I don't want to tell people"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"What kind of things to think about but their version"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"Is usually way better than my version"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"So that basically is the guys in pooster"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"Saying like hey we've seen these Marxist"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"Interpretations that's way more"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"Interesting than what we have to say"
01:34:13;01:34:15;"But it sounds like he's tacitly"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"He's not knocking it I think he's"
01:34:17;01:34:19;"Co-signing it peaches is a Marxist"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"Anthem a lot of members of the DSA"
01:34:21;01:34:23;"Way before Bernie's"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"Presidential run they actually point to"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"The ubiquitous peaches"
01:34:27;01:34:29;"On 90s rock radio is their moment"
01:34:29;01:34:31;"Of radicalization incidentally"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"This band did endorse Bernie"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"In 2016 they did"
01:34:35;01:34:37;"That yeah that's on their wiki"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"Oh hell yeah I knew"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"I f***ed with Pusa"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"Interesting"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"*laughter*"
01:34:45;01:34:47;"Wait but"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Seinfeld do you remember back in the"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"Day so you were pretty psyched"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"You got their first album it has"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"Multiple big hits did you buy the"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"Follow-up no wow"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"I did not stick around for the"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"Actually you know what now I'm looking"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"At the cover of the follow-up I remember"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"I remember you remember like"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"In CD stores there would be like a listening station"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"Where you could like use like the"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"Discussing headphones like everybody's used"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"I remember checking it out"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"And just being like nah"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"I'm not gonna get it I guess when you're like 12 or"
01:35:17;01:35:19;"13 it's like"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"You're trying out different stuff"
01:35:21;01:35:23;"You're not gonna have that kind of"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"Loyalty that us"
01:35:25;01:35:27;"Music industry professionals hope"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"You know"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"One might have"
01:35:31;01:35:33;"Well it was a more mature wise 15"
01:35:33;01:35:35;"Year old Seinfeld well you know"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"It was also that time like pre-iPod"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"When you really had to choose your genre"
01:35:39;01:35:41;"Right and so I remember"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"It was like after this it was like Wu-Tang"
01:35:43;01:35:45;"And then I was just like it was just like"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"Strictly rap for like years"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"After that so you're right"
01:35:49;01:35:51;"I think I was like trying to find my thing"
01:35:51;01:35:53;"But at that point it didn't"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"It didn't really gel with like"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"My own personal music"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"Brand you know what I mean"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"Before you could just listen to anything"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"That's fair and I bet though it's like"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"You know we're pretty close in age"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"And I bet there's a lot of people"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"Who were like"
01:36:09;01:36:11;"Had that album slash were just"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"Kind of fans of Peaches and Lump"
01:36:13;01:36:15;"Who probably went on to do like"
01:36:15;01:36:17;"Take that kind of a reverence"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"Whether into the"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"Social media sphere"
01:36:21;01:36:23;"Arts, politics you know"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"Because that first album was just like"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"So much bigger than the subsequent"
01:36:27;01:36:29;"Ones I'm sure they have like ride or die"
01:36:29;01:36:31;"Fans but like I do think"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"Because that album was so big"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"People can kind of like"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"You know inside you think about them once a year"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"And then you remember like oh my god the songs are massive"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"That was like a cool band"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"But I bet there's like a lot of people out there"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"Who really connected with"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"Presidents of the United States of America"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"At a formative age and maybe didn't think about them"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"Afterwards they moved on to Wu-Tang"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"But I bet there's a few people"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"Listening right now who are just like oh f**k man"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"Yeah actually Lump and Peaches"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"I never thought about how much those songs meant to me"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"Shout out to Presidents of the United States of America great band"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"It's time"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"For the top 5"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"5 on iTunes"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"So this week"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"On the top 5 we're gonna just do"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"The top 5 songs"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"On the Billboard alternative songs chart"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"This week in 95"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"Why 95 Seinfeld?"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"Because the year that"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"Presidents of the United States of America's debut"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"Album"
01:37:25;01:37:27;"Presidents of the United States of America came out"
01:37:27;01:37:29;"Absolutely"
01:37:29;01:37:31;"I love how 90s TC has been lately"
01:37:31;01:37:33;"Like the"
01:37:33;01:37:35;"Last episode of"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"2020"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"The Jake vs Rashida"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"Gen X showdown"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"We're just keeping the 90s love going strong"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"So this week"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"We're just gonna do the alternative songs list"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"It was interesting on the last episode"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"Because I think we all found"
01:37:51;01:37:53;"That the 92 alternative chart"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"Hadn't crossed over into grunge land yet"
01:37:55;01:37:57;"Number one was Peter Gabriel"
01:37:57;01:37:59;"Let's see what the top 5 is like"
01:37:59;01:38:01;"In 95"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"I imagine by then we'll be a little more"
01:38:03;01:38:05;"Familiar although I look at the number 5"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"Song and I'm already kind of surprised"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"Number 5"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"Is the Stone Roses"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"With Love Spreads"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"Stone Roses"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"Like famously"
01:38:17;01:38:19;"Not that big in the US"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"Right, I'm surprised this is"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"On there"
01:38:23;01:38:41;"I mean damn talk about 70s"
01:38:41;01:38:43;"Yeah"
01:38:43;01:38:45;"I mean Jake"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"How familiar are you with the Stone Roses period"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"Not very I know their song"
01:38:49;01:38:51;"I wanna be a dog"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"You know that song?"
01:38:55;01:38:57;"That's a good song that's from the first album"
01:38:57;01:38:59;"I love that song"
01:38:59;01:39:01;"This is kind of like"
01:39:01;01:39:03;"Exile Main Street meets"
01:39:03;01:39:05;"Physical Graffiti or something"
01:39:05;01:39:07;"Yeah we're no vocals"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"This is like we're waiting"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"For like a baseball player"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"To like come out"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"And is like uh"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"Johnny you're a bat"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"Johnny's in the dugout"
01:39:19;01:39:21;"He's a cook"
01:39:27;01:39:29;"Even the vocals come in late"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"The confused announcers are just like"
01:39:31;01:39:33;"No sign of Johnny Damon"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"Uh"
01:39:35;01:39:37;"Little bit chaotic scene on the field"
01:39:37;01:39:39;"Right now"
01:39:39;01:39:41;"Johnny's in the clubhouse he's on the john"
01:39:45;01:39:47;"The Red Sox forfeit a run"
01:39:47;01:39:49;"Highly unusual"
01:39:49;01:39:51;"(Laughter)"
01:39:51;01:39:53;"I guess they're gonna pinch hit"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"For Johnny Damon but Johnny Damon's out of the game"
01:39:55;01:39:57;"(Laughter)"
01:39:59;01:40:01;"I don't know the Stone Roses second album that well"
01:40:01;01:40:03;"And like I was saying"
01:40:03;01:40:05;"They're famously"
01:40:05;01:40:07;"Are not very well known in the US"
01:40:07;01:40:09;"But a deeply"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"Beloved big influential band"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"In the UK"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"Late in life I got into their first album"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"Which rules"
01:40:17;01:40:19;"I wanna be adored waterfall"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"And then they had a single"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"Um called fools gold"
01:40:23;01:40:25;"That was their kind of like baggy"
01:40:25;01:40:27;"Like funky song"
01:40:27;01:40:29;"Their first album is no pun intended"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"A stone cold classic"
01:40:31;01:40:33;"And that just doesn't really sound much like"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"Like 1995"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"Alt radio as I remember it"
01:40:37;01:40:39;"Doesn't that last one feel"
01:40:39;01:40:41;"Kind of adjacent to black crows though"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"I mean I feel like"
01:40:43;01:40:45;"Sure"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"There's a popular sound at this time"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"That's not as far off from as it may seem"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"Although you know you really gotta think about"
01:40:51;01:40:53;"Black crows were huge in like 1990"
01:40:53;01:40:55;"By 95"
01:40:55;01:40:57;"They were"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"Not true"
01:40:59;01:41:01;"I mean I'm sure they were still big but just like"
01:41:01;01:41:03;"They were an anomaly for sure"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"In terms of like contemporary bands"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"That were huge"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Like my dad liked the black crows"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"But he did not like Nirvana"
01:41:11;01:41:13;"And Soundgarden you know what I mean"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"Like they kind of stuck out"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"Further kind of retro vibe"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"Yeah they were kind of on their own"
01:41:19;01:41:21;"Path"
01:41:21;01:41:23;"Okay the number 4 song"
01:41:23;01:41:25;"Now we're getting into very familiar territory"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"Little bit of Connecticut territory"
01:41:27;01:41:29;"Number 4"
01:41:29;01:41:31;"Weezer Buddy Holly"
01:41:31;01:41:33;"Oh heads up"
01:41:33;01:41:35;"Connecticut native Rivers Cuomo"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"Love that guitar tone"
01:41:37;01:41:39;"Why do they"
01:41:39;01:41:41;"Just that like"
01:41:41;01:41:43;"90's power chord distortion"
01:41:43;01:41:45;"Heavy"
01:41:45;01:41:55;"I mean"
01:41:55;01:41:57;"This is just an incredible album"
01:41:57;01:41:59;"Truly one of the greats of the decade"
01:41:59;01:42:03;"Did I ever tell you guys that"
01:42:03;01:42:05;"For my brother's bar mitzvah"
01:42:05;01:42:07;"My mom was a big fan of"
01:42:07;01:42:09;"My brother's bar mitzvah"
01:42:09;01:42:11;"My mom went to the whiz"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"And they were having a"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"Sort of a surplus sale on the"
01:42:15;01:42:17;"Maxi single for Sweater Song"
01:42:17;01:42:19;"And my mom just bought"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"Like a hundred of them"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"And those were the giveaways"
01:42:23;01:42:25;"For like the limbo at my brother's bar mitzvah"
01:42:25;01:42:27;"They were just trying to offload"
01:42:27;01:42:29;"Like a crate of CD singles"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"The maxi singles"
01:42:31;01:42:33;"Tape singles of the Sweater Song"
01:42:33;01:42:35;"Oh the cassette single"
01:42:35;01:42:37;"The single of Sweater Song"
01:42:37;01:42:39;"That was the big giveaway"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"Man I love the cassettes"
01:42:41;01:42:43;"Boop boop"
01:42:43;01:42:47;"Boop boop"
01:42:47;01:42:49;"Boop boop"
01:42:53;01:42:57;"It's real, I get dressed like money, I get it"
01:42:57;01:43:01;"Oh oh, and you're married, I'm a bore"
01:43:01;01:43:03;"I don't care what they say about us"
01:43:03;01:43:05;"'Cause we're"
01:43:05;01:43:07;"I don't care 'bout that"
01:43:07;01:43:11;"I don't care 'bout that"
01:43:11;01:43:15;"When they say it's not my fault"
01:43:15;01:43:17;"'Cause they say it's not our fault"
01:43:17;01:43:19;"Oh no, what a fool"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"Don't joke now, but last night's my chance"
01:43:21;01:43:23;"Oh I love this transition coming up into the guitar solo"
01:43:23;01:43:25;"Oh yeah"
01:43:25;01:43:27;"I don't care what they say"
01:43:27;01:43:29;"'Cause they say it's not my fault"
01:43:29;01:43:31;"Oh oh"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"Weezer Blue Album"
01:43:41;01:43:43;"Stone Cold Classic"
01:43:43;01:43:45;"You know it's funny, Weezer's another band where it's like"
01:43:45;01:43:47;"I never actually bought the Blue Album"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"But I just was like, so many people I knew had it"
01:43:49;01:43:51;"I was just always very excited to see the video for this"
01:43:51;01:43:53;"I was just always kind of like"
01:43:53;01:43:55;"I like the quirky bands"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"Did you buy Pinkerton?"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"I didn't buy Pinkerton"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"But I taped like a late night radio show"
01:44:01;01:44:03;"Off K-Rock in New York"
01:44:03;01:44:05;"That had El Scorcho on it"
01:44:05;01:44:07;"So I wasn't totally checked in to like the critical discourse"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"Around music yet"
01:44:09;01:44:11;"So it was only later that I found out that"
01:44:11;01:44:13;"Like Pinkerton had this weird"
01:44:13;01:44:15;"Like, I don't know"
01:44:17;01:44:19;"Like Pinkerton had this weird arc"
01:44:19;01:44:21;"Of like being a flop"
01:44:21;01:44:23;"And like bad reviews"
01:44:23;01:44:25;"And people hating on it and then it became this classic"
01:44:25;01:44:27;"'Cause I just kind of remember being like"
01:44:27;01:44:29;"El Scorcho, that's like a sick"
01:44:29;01:44:31;"Weezer song"
01:44:31;01:44:33;"And also the idea that"
01:44:33;01:44:35;"That you kind of read in the discourse around Pinkerton"
01:44:35;01:44:37;"Which is like, yo that album was like"
01:44:37;01:44:39;"So dark and weird"
01:44:39;01:44:41;"It alienated the critics, it alienated the fans"
01:44:41;01:44:43;"And I can see that in certain lyrics"
01:44:43;01:44:45;"In retrospect, I know what they're talking about"
01:44:45;01:44:47;"But I remember when I first encountered that narrative"
01:44:47;01:44:49;"I was just like picturing myself jamming this cassette"
01:44:49;01:44:51;"Of like a radio rip of"
01:44:51;01:44:53;"El Scorcho and I was like, what?"
01:44:53;01:44:55;"Just like, El Scorcho!"
01:44:55;01:44:57;"Like, just picturing"
01:44:57;01:44:59;"Somebody hearing El Scorcho and just being like"
01:44:59;01:45:01;"Yo"
01:45:01;01:45:03;"Rivers is in a really dark place, man"
01:45:03;01:45:05;"You know, like"
01:45:05;01:45:07;"I don't know"
01:45:07;01:45:09;"That's the goofiest song on the record, but that's hilarious"
01:45:09;01:45:11;"I know, but it was the lead single, as I recall"
01:45:11;01:45:13;"That's really funny"
01:45:13;01:45:15;"And then just the other songs"
01:45:15;01:45:17;"I don't wanna be an old man anymore"
01:45:17;01:45:19;"That's like a super blue album"
01:45:19;01:45:21;"I also think a big part of it"
01:45:21;01:45:23;"Was the album cover"
01:45:23;01:45:25;"That like, you know, Japanese woodblock"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"Very black print"
01:45:27;01:45:29;"Snow falling, kind of dark"
01:45:29;01:45:31;"I feel like, because you know"
01:45:31;01:45:33;"In all the press you read, Rivers is very"
01:45:33;01:45:35;"Like, kind of traumatized"
01:45:35;01:45:37;"By the reception of that album"
01:45:37;01:45:39;"So you can imagine that"
01:45:39;01:45:41;"First off it was a blue album, then they do this"
01:45:41;01:45:43;"Kind of like weird, dark, vibey"
01:45:43;01:45:45;"Image on the cover"
01:45:45;01:45:47;"And then he was like, ""Uh, you know, back to colors"""
01:45:47;01:45:49;"""Green"""
01:45:49;01:45:51;"And I truly wondered, I wish I had a time machine"
01:45:51;01:45:53;"If Pinkerton"
01:45:53;01:45:55;"Was just called the green album"
01:45:55;01:45:57;"And it was just like another picture of the band with a green background"
01:45:57;01:45:59;"Would the reception have been"
01:45:59;01:46:01;"Different at the time?"
01:46:01;01:46:03;"I say yes"
01:46:03;01:46:05;"Yeah, I feel that"
01:46:05;01:46:07;"The number three song, this week in 1995"
01:46:07;01:46:09;"Is from REM"
01:46:09;01:46:11;"""Bang and Blame"""
01:46:11;01:46:13;"Do you know the song, Jake, before we play it?"
01:46:13;01:46:15;"""Bang and Blame"""
01:46:15;01:46:17;"Is it off ""Monster""? I probably know it"
01:46:17;01:46:19;"It's off ""Monster"""
01:46:19;01:46:21;"It's a song about domestic violence"
01:46:21;01:46:23;"Despite being written before the O.J. Simpson trial"
01:46:23;01:46:25;"Many people interpreted the song to be about that"
01:46:25;01:46:27;"Okay"
01:46:27;01:46:29;"Yeah, I'm not sure if I know this"
01:46:29;01:46:31;"Although I've always said that my favorite REM song"
01:46:31;01:46:33;"Is"
01:46:33;01:46:35;"""What's the Frequency, Kenneth"""
01:46:35;01:46:37;"From the same album"
01:46:37;01:46:39;"Do you know the REM song?"
01:46:39;01:46:41;"I love that song"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"Yeah, I think it's such a good song"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"I agree"
01:46:45;01:46:47;"There's another song on this record called ""Strange Currencies"""
01:46:47;01:46:49;"Which is like this beautiful ballad"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"You know that one?"
01:46:51;01:46:53;"Not off the top of my head"
01:46:53;01:47:01;"Yeah, not my favorite REM"
01:47:01;01:47:03;"That's cool"
01:47:03;01:47:05;"Although, yeah, it's funny"
01:47:05;01:47:07;"I'm on this show partially because"
01:47:07;01:47:09;"Anytime REM comes up"
01:47:09;01:47:11;"We get a semi-random song"
01:47:11;01:47:13;"Remember on the last episode"
01:47:13;01:47:15;"That song featuring Stipe"
01:47:15;01:47:17;"It was ""Nana Cherry"" featuring Michael Stipe"
01:47:17;01:47:19;"None of us had heard it"
01:47:19;01:47:21;"There was also an REM song"
01:47:21;01:47:23;"""Big God Hand"""
01:47:23;01:47:25;"We haven't been getting the big singles"
01:47:25;01:47:27;"From any of these albums"
01:47:27;01:47:29;"Rather than talk about ""Bang and Blame"""
01:47:29;01:47:31;"I'm just curious, Jake"
01:47:31;01:47:33;"Are you an REM head?"
01:47:33;01:47:35;"Did you listen to those CDs back in the day?"
01:47:35;01:47:37;"Yeah, I'm not a head"
01:47:37;01:47:39;"I'm not a completist"
01:47:39;01:47:41;"But I'm a fan"
01:47:41;01:47:43;"And there's a few of their records that I know very well"
01:47:43;01:47:45;"""Automatic for the People"""
01:47:45;01:47:47;"Oh yeah, that's the classic, big stuff"
01:47:47;01:47:49;"What about some of that 80s REM?"
01:47:49;01:47:51;"I know ""Murmur"" really well"
01:47:51;01:47:53;"That was a tape that I had"
01:47:53;01:47:55;"That my brother and I listened to a ton together"
01:47:55;01:47:57;"And ""Document"""
01:47:57;01:47:59;"But yeah, I don't know ""Life's Rich Pageant"""
01:47:59;01:48:01;"I know songs off that record"
01:48:01;01:48:03;"But I don't know that record"
01:48:03;01:48:05;"I have blind spots"
01:48:05;01:48:07;"But I love REM"
01:48:07;01:48:09;"I'll say this, I love their high points"
01:48:09;01:48:11;"What about you?"
01:48:11;01:48:13;"Are there albums of yours that you know front to back?"
01:48:13;01:48:15;"I guess I probably know"
01:48:15;01:48:17;"""Automatic for the People"""
01:48:17;01:48:19;"More or less"
01:48:19;01:48:21;"Front to back"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"And yeah, going back to ""Murmur"""
01:48:23;01:48:25;"It is fascinating to hear"
01:48:25;01:48:27;"That real, arty, indie shit"
01:48:27;01:48:29;"And then be like"
01:48:29;01:48:31;"""Oh, I know the same band that just wrote these"
01:48:31;01:48:33;"Massive, 'Everybody Hurts' type songs"""
01:48:33;01:48:35;"I mean, to me"
01:48:35;01:48:37;"It's not that different"
01:48:37;01:48:39;"They would change their sound from record to record"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"But it all felt"
01:48:41;01:48:43;"Organic and very unforced"
01:48:43;01:48:45;"There's songs on ""Murmur"""
01:48:45;01:48:47;"That I think are as beautiful"
01:48:47;01:48:49;"As ""Everybody Hurts"""
01:48:49;01:48:51;"They maybe don't have the"
01:48:51;01:48:53;"String section or whatever"
01:48:53;01:48:55;"Right, maybe I'm just even thinking about the lyrics"
01:48:55;01:48:57;"It's like"
01:48:57;01:48:59;"Stipe is a legend, he's a real cool lyricist"
01:48:59;01:49:01;"And just the fact that it's like"
01:49:01;01:49:03;"They had a song called"
01:49:03;01:49:05;"""Moral Kiosk"""
01:49:05;01:49:07;"That sounds like the fall or something"
01:49:07;01:49:09;"Like real, artsy, weirdo shit"
01:49:09;01:49:11;"It sounds like a pavement"
01:49:11;01:49:13;"Is he kind of the originator of a certain type of"
01:49:13;01:49:15;"That GBV"
01:49:15;01:49:17;"I think so, I know Stipe was a huge"
01:49:17;01:49:19;"Influence on Pollard and Malcmas"
01:49:19;01:49:21;"No doubt"
01:49:21;01:49:23;"And I guess before him I could think of"
01:49:23;01:49:25;"Maybe some weird English shit"
01:49:25;01:49:27;"Like, I don't know"
01:49:27;01:49:29;"If there was a ""Wire"" song called ""Moral Kiosk"""
01:49:29;01:49:31;"I could kind of see it"
01:49:31;01:49:33;"But anyway, to go from ""Moral Kiosk"""
01:49:33;01:49:35;"To ""Everybody Hurts"" that's a cool"
01:49:35;01:49:37;"Arc"
01:49:37;01:49:39;"It's funny, REM was"
01:49:39;01:49:41;"I was just mentioning the Black Crowes"
01:49:41;01:49:43;"How my dad liked the Black Crowes"
01:49:43;01:49:45;"REM was another band"
01:49:45;01:49:47;"In terms of bands that were contemporary"
01:49:47;01:49:49;"In the 90's"
01:49:49;01:49:51;"That was the other band that my dad"
01:49:51;01:49:53;"Liked and would listen to"
01:49:53;01:49:55;"Interesting, you think he got in"
01:49:55;01:49:57;"Through losing my religion?"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"Yeah, he loved"
01:49:59;01:50:01;"I remember he loved losing my religion"
01:50:01;01:50:03;"I remember a few years ago"
01:50:03;01:50:05;"He picked me up from the airport and it was just automatic for the people"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"Playing in the Tesla"
01:50:07;01:50:09;"I was like, tight choice dad"
01:50:09;01:50:11;"The number"
01:50:11;01:50:13;"Two song"
01:50:13;01:50:15;"Alright, so now ""Stone Rose"" is a little"
01:50:15;01:50:17;"Surprising, but now we've just got"
01:50:17;01:50:19;"Nothing but the big 90's names"
01:50:19;01:50:21;"At least from the US point of view"
01:50:21;01:50:23;"Weezer REM"
01:50:23;01:50:25;"Number 2, how fitting"
01:50:25;01:50:27;"Pearl Jam with Better Man"
01:50:27;01:50:29;"Good song"
01:50:29;01:50:31;"Better Man was never released"
01:50:31;01:50:33;"As a proper single, but topped the mainstream"
01:50:33;01:50:35;"Rock charts for 8 weeks and peaked at number 2"
01:50:35;01:50:37;"On the alternative airplay chart"
01:50:37;01:50:39;"Whoa"
01:50:39;01:50:41;"Says Eddie Vedder wrote Better Man in high school"
01:50:41;01:50:43;"And based the melody loosely on the"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"English beat ""Save it for Later"""
01:50:45;01:50:47;"Oh yeah, I think that's a thing they do live"
01:50:47;01:50:49;"They go into ""Save it for Later"""
01:50:49;01:50:51;"Which is a song I love"
01:50:51;01:50:53;"Mhm"
01:50:53;01:50:57;"Interesting he wrote this in high school"
01:50:57;01:50:59;"Wow"
01:50:59;01:51:01;"Like busted it out"
01:51:01;01:51:03;"Like he probably wrote it in the mid 80's"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"Waiting"
01:51:05;01:51:07;"Watching the clock"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"It's 4 o'clock"
01:51:09;01:51:11;"It's got to stop"
01:51:11;01:51:13;"Tell her"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"Take no more"
01:51:15;01:51:17;"She practices her"
01:51:19;01:51:21;"Speech as he opens the door"
01:51:21;01:51:23;"She rolls over"
01:51:23;01:51:25;"Pretends to sleep"
01:51:25;01:51:27;"As he looks her over"
01:51:27;01:51:29;"She lies"
01:51:29;01:51:31;"And says"
01:51:31;01:51:33;"She's in love"
01:51:33;01:51:35;"With him"
01:51:35;01:51:37;"You'll find a better man"
01:51:37;01:51:39;"You know, listen to this"
01:51:39;01:51:41;"I kind of see Jack's point"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"That like, the Jarl was toned down"
01:51:43;01:51:45;"By the mythology"
01:51:45;01:51:47;"I think Jack was saying that"
01:51:47;01:51:49;"Better recorded ""Hunger Strike"""
01:51:49;01:51:51;"Like right at the beginning of his"
01:51:51;01:51:53;"Time with Pearl Jam"
01:51:53;01:51:55;"That it was like one of the first things he recorded"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"So it was before 10"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"Yeah, I guess so"
01:51:59;01:52:01;"At least recorded before 10"
01:52:01;01:52:11;"Talking"
01:52:11;01:52:13;"To herself"
01:52:13;01:52:15;"There's no one else"
01:52:15;01:52:17;"Who needs to know"
01:52:17;01:52:19;"She tells herself"
01:52:19;01:52:27;"Memories back when"
01:52:27;01:52:29;"She was old and strong"
01:52:29;01:52:31;"And waiting"
01:52:31;01:52:33;"For the world to"
01:52:33;01:52:35;"Come along"
01:52:35;01:52:37;"It's where she knew"
01:52:37;01:52:39;"Although actually, throw on ""Save It For Later"""
01:52:39;01:52:41;"English beat, 'cause"
01:52:41;01:52:43;"I always loved that song"
01:52:43;01:52:45;"That's tight that"
01:52:45;01:52:47;"Eddie was a big fan"
01:52:47;01:52:55;"So, Pearl Jam has"
01:52:55;01:52:57;"Covered this?"
01:52:57;01:52:59;"I think they do a little tag when they play"
01:52:59;01:53:01;"""Better Man"""
01:53:01;01:53:03;"They go into ""Save It For Later"" a little"
01:53:03;01:53:05;"Oh yeah, this song is great"
01:53:05;01:53:07;"I need that mother"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"Just know my heart, but I come"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"To a decision out here"
01:53:11;01:53:21;"Sooner or later"
01:53:21;01:53:23;"You'll make it where you left it while"
01:53:23;01:53:25;"Save it for later"
01:53:25;01:53:27;"Don't run away and let me down"
01:53:27;01:53:29;"Sooner or later"
01:53:29;01:53:31;"You'll hit the deck, you'll get found out"
01:53:31;01:53:33;"Save it for later"
01:53:33;01:53:35;"Don't let me down"
01:53:35;01:53:39;"She loves a session"
01:53:39;01:53:41;"No way"
01:53:41;01:53:43;"Is this like early 80s?"
01:53:43;01:53:45;"Yeah"
01:53:45;01:53:47;"And this band, the English Beat, they were like"
01:53:47;01:53:49;"They were kind of like the specials"
01:53:49;01:53:51;"Like ska bands"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"I don't know this band very well, but I know this song"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"Dave Wakeling"
01:53:55;01:53:57;"From the English Beat, so he wrote a lot of great"
01:53:57;01:53:59;"Songs in this band, and they had that band"
01:53:59;01:54:01;"General Public that had that hit"
01:54:01;01:54:03;"Woah, tenderness"
01:54:03;01:54:05;"You know ""Tenderness""?"
01:54:05;01:54:07;"I think so, if I heard it"
01:54:07;01:54:09;"Yeah, throw ""Tenderness"" on"
01:54:09;01:54:13;"This is his ex-band"
01:54:13;01:54:15;"He's so dope, I love him"
01:54:15;01:54:17;"Wow, this dude rules"
01:54:17;01:54:19;"This is definitely a blind spot"
01:54:29;01:54:31;"Want to stop"
01:54:31;01:54:35;"Definitely a contemporary with The Cure"
01:54:35;01:54:37;"Yeah"
01:54:37;01:54:45;"Seems like without"
01:54:45;01:54:47;"Tenderness there's something missing"
01:54:47;01:54:53;"I could see Vampire covering these songs"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"Totally"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"I mean it's funny to think like"
01:54:57;01:54:59;"I referenced both of these songs all the time"
01:54:59;01:55:01;"Going back to the early days"
01:55:01;01:55:03;"It is funny to think that like"
01:55:03;01:55:05;"Vampire and Pearl Jam"
01:55:05;01:55:07;"Share a tiny bit of DNA"
01:55:07;01:55:11;"With the English Beat"
01:55:11;01:55:13;"Still thinking about"
01:55:13;01:55:15;"Which PJ songs Vampire can cover"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"How about"
01:55:17;01:55:19;"Elderly Woman Behind a Counter in a Small Town"
01:55:19;01:55:21;"That's come up, we've had some interesting conversations"
01:55:21;01:55:23;"Really? It's gotten as far as conversation"
01:55:23;01:55:25;"Wow"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"We talked about it on the show"
01:55:27;01:55:29;"Oh, okay, yeah, just like recently"
01:55:29;01:55:31;"Yeah, okay, let's move on"
01:55:31;01:55:33;"I wonder what's gonna be number one"
01:55:33;01:55:35;"I'm very interested in this"
01:55:35;01:55:37;"So that was number two, Pearl Jam"
01:55:37;01:55:39;"I haven't looked yet, have you seen it yet Jake?"
01:55:39;01:55:41;"What number one is? No, I don't know what it is"
01:55:41;01:55:43;"I mean let's see, 95"
01:55:43;01:55:45;"Are we gonna guess?"
01:55:45;01:55:47;"I'm gonna guess"
01:55:47;01:55:49;"Yeah, what's your guess?"
01:55:49;01:55:51;"Bush, Glycerine"
01:55:51;01:55:53;"Glycerine"
01:55:53;01:55:55;"I don't know what year that album came out"
01:55:55;01:55:57;"But I feel like that's more like 96 and that would have been"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"Top of the charts"
01:55:59;01:56:01;"We're in January of 95"
01:56:01;01:56:03;"Yeah, January 95"
01:56:03;01:56:05;"So something that came out in 94"
01:56:05;01:56:07;"Stone Temple Pilots?"
01:56:07;01:56:09;"Or like maybe The Offspring"
01:56:09;01:56:11;"Oh yeah, that's a great guess, it could definitely be The Offspring"
01:56:11;01:56:13;"Because that album came out in 94"
01:56:13;01:56:15;"Alright, let's find out the number one song"
01:56:15;01:56:17;"This week"
01:56:17;01:56:19;"Or something off Dookie"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"Oh, sh*t, another great call"
01:56:21;01:56:23;"Yeah!"
01:56:23;01:56:25;"Hell yeah Jake"
01:56:25;01:56:27;"We're all done"
01:56:27;01:56:37;"I heard you crying loud"
01:56:37;01:56:41;"All the way across town"
01:56:41;01:56:45;"To be searching for that someone"
01:56:45;01:56:47;"That is the out of the crowd"
01:56:47;01:56:53;"Yeah, just sit around feeling sorry for yourself"
01:56:53;01:56:59;"Well, don't get lonely now"
01:56:59;01:57:03;"And dry your whining eyes"
01:57:03;01:57:05;"I'm just living for the moment"
01:57:05;01:57:07;"Sleeping on my back just in time"
01:57:07;01:57:13;"Just so uptight you've been thinking about ditching me"
01:57:13;01:57:19;"No time to pass the world around"
01:57:19;01:57:23;"Where I'll be found when I come around"
01:57:23;01:57:25;"It never struck me at the time"
01:57:25;01:57:29;"But hearing this with Weezer"
01:57:29;01:57:31;"Like they have such a similar tone actually"
01:57:31;01:57:33;"Oh yeah, definitely this song"
01:57:33;01:57:37;"Yeah, because I kind of always remember finding this song interesting"
01:57:37;01:57:39;"Because like Basket Case"
01:57:39;01:57:43;"Is like very obviously like in the punk tradition"
01:57:43;01:57:45;"And this song is like, the groove is kind of like"
01:57:45;01:57:47;"Something different, you know"
01:57:47;01:57:51;"It's got a little bit of that Spin Doctors energy"
01:57:51;01:57:53;"A little? Yeah"
01:57:53;01:57:57;"So go do what you like"
01:57:57;01:58:01;"Make sure you do it right"
01:58:01;01:58:03;"You may find out that you're not the best"
01:58:03;01:58:05;"It's got a little bit of that Scarlett Begonia's energy"
01:58:05;01:58:07;"And I'll be there"
01:58:07;01:58:11;"You can't go for something if it's just not right"
01:58:11;01:58:13;"Just mildly syncopated"
01:58:13;01:58:15;"No time to search the world around"
01:58:15;01:58:17;"Eight minute when I come around"
01:58:17;01:58:19;"'Cause you know where I'll be found"
01:58:19;01:58:21;"When I come around"
01:58:21;01:58:23;"(scatting)"
01:58:23;01:58:25;"Like just Jerry coming solo over this"
01:58:41;01:58:45;"No time to search the world around"
01:58:45;01:58:49;"'Cause you know where I'll be found"
01:58:49;01:58:51;"When I come around"
01:58:51;01:58:53;"Does that song sound a little bit like"
01:58:53;01:58:55;"Good by Better Than Ezra?"
01:58:55;01:58:57;"Sure, yeah"
01:58:57;01:59:01;"Wow, it is good living with you"
01:59:01;01:59:03;"Is that a Herm? Wait, Herm?"
01:59:03;01:59:05;"Yeah, I think there's a little bit of Herm y'all"
01:59:05;01:59:07;"Yeah, a little Herm there"
01:59:07;01:59:09;"I'm sure I've said it on the show before"
01:59:09;01:59:11;"This band loomed large for me"
01:59:11;01:59:13;"As you can imagine being in middle school"
01:59:13;01:59:15;"Mid-90s"
01:59:15;01:59:17;"Luckily, it's like"
01:59:17;01:59:19;"It's funny, like"
01:59:19;01:59:21;"I have heard stories about people who like"
01:59:21;01:59:23;"Some pop cultural thing came out"
01:59:23;01:59:25;"That had to do with their name"
01:59:25;01:59:27;"And it made like, life hell for a while"
01:59:27;01:59:29;"What's a good example of that?"
01:59:29;01:59:31;"Well, actually I have to give them a funny one"
01:59:31;01:59:33;"That I just remember Ariel"
01:59:33;01:59:35;"Friend of the show"
01:59:35;01:59:37;"Telling me that he had a memory"
01:59:37;01:59:39;"Of being on a school trip"
01:59:39;01:59:41;"When he"
01:59:41;01:59:43;"I don't know how old he would have been"
01:59:43;01:59:45;"But he was a little kid"
01:59:45;01:59:47;"And he went on a school trip"
01:59:47;01:59:49;"And they were going to see a movie"
01:59:49;01:59:51;"And one of the previews"
01:59:51;01:59:53;"Before the movie"
01:59:53;01:59:55;"Was a new, really big"
01:59:55;01:59:57;"Disney animated film"
01:59:57;01:59:59;"Called The Little Mermaid"
01:59:59;02:00:01;"He's told this story in a very funny way"
02:00:01;02:00:03;"Before, he's just kind of sitting there like"
02:00:03;02:00:05;"Oh, a new Disney movie, tight"
02:00:05;02:00:07;"And then it's just like, introducing"
02:00:07;02:00:09;"Ariel!"
02:00:09;02:00:11;"And just like, him having this name"
02:00:11;02:00:13;"That maybe at the time not a lot of people knew"
02:00:13;02:00:15;"And then it's like, this mermaid"
02:00:15;02:00:17;"Female mermaid with red hair"
02:00:17;02:00:19;"He just had this feeling, like being in the theater"
02:00:19;02:00:21;"Like everybody's starting to look at him"
02:00:21;02:00:23;"And he described his stomach drop"
02:00:23;02:00:25;"And he's like, oh f***"
02:00:25;02:00:27;"This is not good"
02:00:27;02:00:29;"But the truth is, for Better Than Ezra"
02:00:29;02:00:31;"On the one hand, it sounds kind of like bad"
02:00:31;02:00:33;"And actually it's funny"
02:00:33;02:00:35;"People have made this joke before"
02:00:35;02:00:37;"That there's also this ska punk band"
02:00:37;02:00:39;"Less Than Jake"
02:00:39;02:00:41;"So weirdly, our show, there's somebody out there"
02:00:41;02:00:43;"Who's less than Jake but better than Ezra"
02:00:43;02:00:45;"And they can one day be the third host of this show"
02:00:45;02:00:47;"But"
02:00:47;02:00:49;"There's something"
02:00:49;02:00:51;"So on the one hand, Better Than Ezra"
02:00:51;02:00:53;"Kind of sounds like, oh s***"
02:00:53;02:00:55;"That could be like a Little Mermaid or Karen moment"
02:00:55;02:00:57;"And yet, in practice"
02:00:57;02:00:59;"There's kind of like"
02:00:59;02:01:01;"Not that much that people could do with it"
02:01:01;02:01:03;"You know what I mean?"
02:01:03;02:01:05;"I just feel like there'd be kids who'd just be like"
02:01:05;02:01:07;"Hey, I'm better than Ezra"
02:01:07;02:01:09;"And I'd just be like, what?"
02:01:09;02:01:11;"You're the band?"
02:01:11;02:01:13;"And they'd just be like, well, no"
02:01:13;02:01:15;"I'm just saying there's a band called Better Than Ezra"
02:01:15;02:01:17;"So that means they're better than you"
02:01:17;02:01:19;"And I'd just be kind of like, alright"
02:01:19;02:01:21;"The band that does good is better than me"
02:01:21;02:01:23;"An 11 year old in New Jersey"
02:01:23;02:01:25;"It just like, it wasn't that easy"
02:01:25;02:01:27;"Yeah, it wasn't that easy"
02:01:27;02:01:29;"It seemed like it would, but it never did"
02:01:29;02:01:31;"Yeah, when I was a kid"
02:01:31;02:01:33;"Yeah, was there a Jake thing?"
02:01:33;02:01:35;"Well, Jake the Snake"
02:01:35;02:01:37;"But it was like, that rules"
02:01:37;02:01:39;"Oh yeah"
02:01:39;02:01:41;"Right, the wrestler"
02:01:41;02:01:43;"Jake the Snake, and I'd be like, hell yeah"
02:01:43;02:01:45;"Hey guys"
02:01:45;02:01:47;"I gotta say, by the way"
02:01:47;02:01:49;"This reminded me of earlier when I was talking about"
02:01:49;02:01:51;"Nomenclative dissonance"
02:01:51;02:01:53;"I would kick myself if I didn't correct myself"
02:01:53;02:01:55;"I messed that up so bad"
02:01:55;02:01:57;"The term is actually Nominative Determinism"
02:01:57;02:01:59;"And I just feel like"
02:01:59;02:02:01;"For posterity and for the kids listening"
02:02:01;02:02:03;"I don't want to like"
02:02:03;02:02:05;"Appreciate that"
02:02:05;02:02:07;"Yeah, I don't want to miseducate anybody"
02:02:07;02:02:09;"Nominative Determinism is the phrase"
02:02:09;02:02:11;"Right, okay, that makes sense"
02:02:11;02:02:13;"Because your name determines"
02:02:13;02:02:15;"Your lifestyle determines your death style"
02:02:15;02:02:17;"Your name determines your"
02:02:17;02:02:19;"It's like"
02:02:19;02:02:21;"A lot of dudes named Jake"
02:02:21;02:02:23;"Jake loves snakes"
02:02:23;02:02:25;"That'd be tight if you became a snake guy, Jake"
02:02:25;02:02:27;"A snake expert"
02:02:27;02:02:29;"Has there ever been, I guess Slash"
02:02:29;02:02:31;"Probably did, I'm just trying"
02:02:31;02:02:33;"I'm just like picturing you on stage with Richard Pictures"
02:02:33;02:02:35;"Just with like a python draped over you"
02:02:35;02:02:37;"Just holding it down"
02:02:37;02:02:39;"That would be insane"
02:02:39;02:02:41;"And actually, I think"
02:02:41;02:02:43;"You know"
02:02:43;02:02:45;"People get very touchy when people bring their animals to shows"
02:02:45;02:02:47;"Even their little dogs and stuff"
02:02:47;02:02:49;"Because, fair point"
02:02:49;02:02:51;"Concerts are very loud"
02:02:51;02:02:53;"And maybe it's not that cool to bring your little dog"
02:02:53;02:02:55;"To like a rock show"
02:02:55;02:02:57;"But, I feel like this is like a kind of"
02:02:57;02:02:59;"Snapple effect"
02:02:59;02:03:01;"Aren't snakes deaf, technically?"
02:03:01;02:03:03;"Oh, I don't know that"
02:03:03;02:03:05;"You could just be f***ing whaling"
02:03:05;02:03:07;"On stage"
02:03:07;02:03:09;"They don't have ears"
02:03:09;02:03:11;"This is my therapy snake"
02:03:11;02:03:13;"Oh yeah, snakes are deaf"
02:03:13;02:03:15;"I'm going to really lobby for this as concerts come back post-covid"
02:03:15;02:03:17;"Because, you know, we're going to really need"
02:03:17;02:03:19;"As many people as possible"
02:03:19;02:03:21;"Out there, saving the live music industry"
02:03:21;02:03:23;"And I'm just going to say"
02:03:23;02:03:25;"To all the powers that be"
02:03:25;02:03:27;"Alright, let's let people bring their snakes"
02:03:27;02:03:29;"To concerts"
02:03:29;02:03:31;"Because we can't alienate"
02:03:31;02:03:33;"Needlessly alienate a whole"
02:03:33;02:03:35;"You know, slice of the population"
02:03:35;02:03:37;"Who would love to come to the show"
02:03:37;02:03:39;"But they don't want to leave their snake at home"
02:03:39;02:03:41;"I want to be doing a Vampire Weekend show"
02:03:41;02:03:43;"Where I look out there and I see"
02:03:43;02:03:45;"One to two hundred snakes"
02:03:45;02:03:47;"Dispersed in the crowd"
02:03:47;02:03:49;"On the shoulders of our fans"
02:03:49;02:03:51;"Who are always praising us"
02:03:51;02:03:53;"Of course"
02:03:53;02:03:55;"Maybe we'll get into that"
02:03:55;02:03:57;"I remember, the snake is now a significant part"
02:03:57;02:03:59;"Of Vampire Weekend iconography"
02:03:59;02:04:01;"That is true, man"
02:04:01;02:04:03;"I remember when we made the Harmony Hall video"
02:04:03;02:04:05;"There's a snake in it"
02:04:05;02:04:07;"That slithers around on some stuff"
02:04:07;02:04:09;"And just like, always"
02:04:09;02:04:11;"Animal wranglers are just such fascinating characters"
02:04:11;02:04:13;"And it was like"
02:04:13;02:04:15;"This like"
02:04:15;02:04:17;"Older Australian dude"
02:04:17;02:04:19;"Just the exact kind of"
02:04:19;02:04:21;"Conversations you'd think you'd probably have"
02:04:21;02:04:23;"With a Hollywood snake wrangler"
02:04:23;02:04:25;"And just being kind of like"
02:04:25;02:04:27;"I remember we were all sitting around"
02:04:27;02:04:29;"Making small talk with a dude"
02:04:29;02:04:31;"Everybody was like, ""Oh my god, it's this big snake!"""
02:04:31;02:04:33;"Everybody was kind of freaked out"
02:04:33;02:04:35;"He's like, ""Don't worry, they won't bite you"""
02:04:35;02:04:37;"He's actually like a real sweetheart"
02:04:37;02:04:39;"And then somebody's like, ""Uh, have you ever been"
02:04:39;02:04:41;"Bitten by a snake?"" And he was just like"
02:04:41;02:04:43;"""Hundreds of times"""
02:04:43;02:04:45;"Anyway, this has been"
02:04:45;02:04:47;"Time Crisis"
02:04:47;02:04:49;"Getting back in the game 2021"
02:04:49;02:04:51;"We'll see you in two weeks"
02:04:51;02:04:53;"Thanks for waiting"
02:04:53;02:04:55;"I know that was a long break from TC"
02:04:55;02:04:57;"For us too"
02:04:57;02:04:59;"Anyway, here's Better Than Ezra with their hit song ""Good"""
02:04:59;02:05:01;"Peace"
02:05:01;02:05:03;"Looking around the house"
02:05:03;02:05:07;"Heading behind the window and the door"
02:05:07;02:05:11;"Searching for signs of life"
02:05:11;02:05:13;"But there's nobody home"
02:05:13;02:05:15;"Nobody home"
02:05:15;02:05:23;"Well, maybe I'm just too sure"
02:05:23;02:05:27;"Or maybe I'm just too frightened"
02:05:27;02:05:31;"By the sound of it"
02:05:31;02:05:33;"Pieces of note fall down"
02:05:33;02:05:35;"But the letter said"
02:05:35;02:05:37;"""I'm home, if it's good"
02:05:37;02:05:39;"You'll never leave me"""
