00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, back in New York City."
00:05;00:12;"As I return to this wretched island, the city of my birth, I'm joined by my cousin Asher"
00:12;00:16;"and my co-hosting rapper friend Despot."
00:16;00:23;"Additionally, we shall talk to Lizzy Goodman, author of Meet Me in the Bathroom, Rebirth"
00:23;00:27;"in Rock and Roll New York City 2001 and 2011."
00:27;00:34;"Get ready for a very New York-"
00:34;00:37;"- 2001."
00:38;00:46;"Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it."
00:46;00:56;"I just slept to get to your apartment. Now I'm staying there just for a while."
00:56;01:01;"I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired."
01:04;01:08;"Is this it?"
01:12;01:17;"Is this it?"
01:17;01:28;"I'm sad they'd give you anything you ever wanted when they lied."
01:28;01:39;"I knew it was just stable children trying hard not to realize I was sitting right behind."
01:39;01:44;"Oh dear, can't you see? It's them, it's not me."
01:44;01:49;"We're not enemies, we just disagree."
01:49;01:56;"If I was like him, hopeless and less power, he changes his mind."
01:56;02:04;"Since I went too far, we all disagree. I think we should disagree."
02:04;02:06;"Yeah."
02:06;02:11;"Is this it?"
02:16;02:22;"Is this it?"
02:22;02:25;"Is this it?"
02:25;02:36;"Can't you see I'm trying? I don't even like it."
02:36;02:46;"I just slept to get to your apartment. Now I'm staying there just for a while."
02:46;02:50;"I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired."
02:50;02:53;"Time Crisis, New York edition."
02:53;02:56;"I gotta say it, it's what I always say when I'm back in New York."
02:56;02:59;"Back in New York, I feel like Patrick Ewing."
03:02;03:06;"Feels good to be back. This is the longest I've ever been away from New York."
03:06;03:10;"I haven't seen my beautiful cousin after about seven months."
03:10;03:11;"It's a little disturbing."
03:11;03:13;"I'm disturbed by it."
03:13;03:17;"Despot is running late. I'm sure he'll give me a hard time when he gets here."
03:17;03:21;"You can't always choose where life brings you, you know?"
03:21;03:25;"No, it's true. It's true, but you do have a home here."
03:25;03:26;"You have a family here."
03:26;03:27;"That's true."
03:27;03:29;"You left us."
03:29;03:35;"The thing is, when your work and your significant other is in one city,"
03:35;03:38;"if they're in two different places, you can do that shuffle."
03:38;03:39;"It's true."
03:39;03:42;"Go work a little bit, then be like, I'm flying home for the week."
03:42;03:44;"But when they're all in the same place, it's tough."
03:44;03:47;"To be fair, this is the second nice day of the year."
03:47;03:51;"So I don't really blame you for being in L.A. the rest of this time."
03:51;03:53;"I know. I have missed the winter."
03:53;04:00;"Anyway, because this is a super New York edition of Time Crisis, it's been a while."
04:00;04:04;"It's just been me and Jake just vibing out in Los Angeles."
04:04;04:08;"Now I'm back to that hustle and bustle city of my birth."
04:08;04:13;"So because this is New York, of course we got Asher and supposedly Despot later."
04:13;04:15;"So I have Lizzie Goodman."
04:15;04:16;"Hey, guys."
04:16;04:18;"Journalist and author."
04:18;04:19;"Does that make sense?"
04:19;04:20;"I love that."
04:20;04:24;"I feel like when I hear that, I always feel like I should have--"
04:24;04:28;"it's like I'm retroactively offended by all the times I was only called a journalist."
04:28;04:30;"Or, you know, like, who knew I should also be an author?"
04:30;04:31;"Because I think it's true."
04:31;04:37;"What do you write when you have to write your occupation on a customs form or something?"
04:37;04:38;"Writer?"
04:38;04:39;"Writer."
04:39;04:41;"Especially on a customs form."
04:41;04:44;"Journalist, I'm always-- I always think someone's going to put me in jail."
04:44;04:45;"Like I just do."
04:45;04:50;"If I can-- when I'm going in and out of, you know, foreign countries of any kind,"
04:50;04:51;"I'm like, ""Don't say you're a journalist."
04:51;04:52;"That's a terrible thing."""
04:52;04:53;"Oh, right."
04:53;04:54;"Yeah, that's-- yeah."
04:54;04:55;"Yeah, that makes sense."
04:55;04:57;"Even though I think that's probably-- I mean, I'm a music and culture journalist."
04:57;05:02;"I don't think anyone's trying to track me down particularly, but just in case."
05:02;05:03;"Just in case."
05:03;05:05;"How many journalists are locked up worldwide?"
05:05;05:06;"A lot."
05:07;05:08;"A whole lot."
05:08;05:10;"How many of them are music-- some of them might cover music, but that's tangential."
05:10;05:13;"So you're here because in two days, your book,"
05:13;05:17;"Meet Me in the Bathroom, Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City,"
05:17;05:20;"2001 to 2011, is coming out."
05:20;05:27;"For people who don't know, this book's already made a bit of a stir on the internet"
05:27;05:33;"because New York Magazine, and even for me, just vibing out,"
05:33;05:38;"chilling hard by the pool in Los Angeles, it's even got to me."
05:38;05:44;"I've been off the grid because New York Magazine ran an excerpt from your book,"
05:44;05:48;"which was under a title like ""Why the Strokes Didn't Become the Biggest Band in the World,"""
05:48;05:50;"and it was an oral history of the Strokes."
05:50;05:52;"Yes, and the book is an oral history."
05:52;05:53;"Oh, the whole book's an oral history."
05:53;05:54;"Oh, yeah."
05:54;05:59;"So actually, I was thinking about this because the Strokes one was fairly explosive"
05:59;06:07;"because you have Julian Casablanca's talking about wanting to beat Ryan Adams' ass"
06:07;06:10;"because he blamed him for getting Albert Hemond hooked on heroin."
06:10;06:16;"So we've got drugs, violence, competitiveness because people in it are talking about"
06:16;06:20;"how supposedly the Strokes felt very competitive with the killers."
06:20;06:21;"Yeah."
06:21;06:25;"You know, these are all juicy things that people like to discuss."
06:25;06:30;"Yes, and yet it's only like, I don't know, 2,000 words or something of what the--"
06:30;06:34;"I mean, it is funny because I'm like, ""Just wait."""
06:34;06:36;"I mean, there's a lot of--"
06:36;06:37;"Actually, I wanted to ask you."
06:37;06:38;"Yeah."
06:38;06:40;"So I did an interview for this book, right?"
06:40;06:41;"You sure did."
06:41;06:43;"That must have been years ago, right?"
06:43;06:44;"Yeah, it's been a long time."
06:44;06:45;"It made me nervous when I saw--"
06:45;06:50;"Okay, admittedly, this is very--"
06:50;06:54;"My thoughts return to myself as the ego compels you to do, but I was reading this--"
06:54;06:55;"It's human nature."
06:55;06:56;"It's human nature, thank you."
06:56;06:57;"Don't worry."
06:57;06:59;"I'm reading these guys--"
06:59;07:04;"And actually, to be fair, as a Strokes fan, I've noticed over the years,"
07:04;07:07;"as Desus and Mero say, they talk spicy about--"
07:07;07:09;"They talk spicy in interviews."
07:09;07:14;"So it didn't surprise me that they would be kind of saying slightly weird things"
07:14;07:16;"about each other and people in their community."
07:16;07:17;"So I was saying, like, it made me nervous."
07:17;07:19;"I was like, ""What did I say?"""
07:19;07:20;"But I don't think there's any way I said anything."
07:20;07:22;"Did I say anything crazy?"
07:22;07:23;"We'll find out."
07:23;07:24;"Oh, no."
07:24;07:25;"Oh, God."
08:18;08:22;"What I will say is that the part where it is true that it's sort of like just wait,"
08:22;08:27;"like part of that is playful, but it's also, like, just imagine that you,"
08:27;08:31;"even as just a regular person, you don't even have to be a Stroke,"
08:31;08:35;"somebody sits down one day and decides to interview everyone who's ever been"
08:35;08:39;"close to you, been in business with you, maybe been married to you, like,"
08:39;08:44;"whatever, and then take those interviews and assemble a story of your life from"
08:44;08:45;"that."
08:45;08:47;"Like, certainly there's going to be things that are going to surprise you,"
08:47;08:50;"both that you said and that other people said about you,"
08:50;08:53;"because one of the sort of tricks of journalism, people are always like,"
08:53;08:55;"""Oh, these shady journalists,"" and it's like, ""Yeah, okay,"
08:55;08:57;"I can see how it feels that way."""
08:57;09:03;"It's partially just that it's a completely unique dynamic of conversation to be"
09:03;09:06;"interviewing someone because the attention is all on their story."
09:06;09:09;"You never have a conversation with someone unless you are, you know,"
09:09;09:12;"a chronic, needs to be institutionalized narcissist,"
09:12;09:16;"where it's like 100% about you, and even then the other person is like a"
09:16;09:18;"victim of that conversation."
09:18;09:23;"So you're sitting down, it's like it's 100% about you."
09:23;09:26;"You ask questions of someone that they're never going to get asked in regular"
09:26;09:27;"life."
09:27;09:34;"So that brings up surprising details for, like, the average human."
09:34;09:39;"And then you're a stroke, or you're James Murphy, or you're Karen O.,"
09:39;09:41;"or you're Ezra."
09:41;09:45;"[Laughter]"
09:45;09:46;"I mean, also--"
09:46;09:47;"Back to you, Ezra."
09:47;09:50;"I'm going to regret this if I did say anything stupid in it,"
09:50;09:54;"but I generally feel like I'm used to doing interviews."
09:54;09:57;"I tend to err on the side of caution."
09:57;10:00;"I think, if anything, I wish I could, like, loosen up sometimes with"
10:00;10:05;"journalists, but, like, there's no way that I would ever--"
10:05;10:08;"I'm not going to talk about somebody else's heroin problem because a"
10:08;10:11;"journalist got you to me."
10:11;10:13;"Right, and also that's not what happened here."
10:13;10:15;"I mean, you have to remember that--"
10:15;10:17;"They're chomping at the bit to talk about this."
10:17;10:19;"I don't know if that's true."
10:19;10:20;"I have to think about that one."
10:20;10:22;"Put a pin in that one for a second."
10:22;10:23;"I have to think about whether I agree with that."
10:23;10:27;"But what's true is that the drug use in the Strokes and many other bands,"
10:27;10:28;"that's what's funny."
10:28;10:31;"It's like it's all happening right now because the Strokes excerpt is"
10:31;10:34;"""What's Out"" because that's what came in New York Magazine first because"
10:34;10:37;"they negotiated that with my publisher."
10:37;10:38;"Yeah, the book is not just about the Strokes."
10:38;10:41;"The book is 100%--and, like, there's more drugs."
10:41;10:45;"Like, turns out, you know, breaking news, the Strokes were not the only"
10:45;10:48;"band doing drugs in New York City in 2001."
10:48;10:50;"You know, I know that's a huge scoop."
10:50;10:55;"But I think that in their case, like, this was a part of their band's"
10:55;10:57;"story because it affected the band."
10:57;11:01;"So, like, the metric I used about people are freaking out, etc., etc.,"
11:01;11:04;"and I'm also sort of just laughing because I'm like,"
11:04;11:08;"""There's so much that I did not put in this book that I gathered from this"
11:08;11:11;"information gathering five years of reporting it,"
11:11;11:15;"and what's in there is in there--it's, of course,"
11:15;11:17;"me making the assessment and my editor,"
11:17;11:22;"but what's in there is in there because it somehow affected the story of that"
11:22;11:24;"artist at that period of time and, of course,"
11:24;11:26;"because they chose to tell me about it."
11:26;11:27;"I mean, you can't print something no one said."
11:27;11:31;"But the drug stuff with the Strokes or the drug stuff with other bands,"
11:31;11:35;"which is coming, or the, you know, infighting and the drama,"
11:35;11:37;"things people would consider gossip is relevant."
11:37;11:38;"Yeah, and they've always talked about that."
11:38;11:40;"It's always been there, and it's relevant because it's like,"
11:40;11:42;"""F--- with your band."""
11:48;11:53;"So more is what they were taken with"
11:53;11:56;"Hard times opened their eyes"
11:56;11:59;"Saw pain in a new way"
11:59;12:03;"Our stakes for a few names"
12:03;12:06;"Racing against sunbeams"
12:06;12:10;"Losing against the truth"
12:10;12:14;"And your eyes"
12:14;12:18;"They're on"
12:18;12:24;"Stop and go"
12:24;12:27;"And your eyes"
12:27;12:31;"They're on"
12:31;12:37;"Stop and go"
12:37;12:41;"And your eyes"
12:41;12:43;"I found, like, when I was looking at some people reacting like this was, like,"
12:43;12:46;"so explosive, I had a bunch of feelings."
12:46;12:50;"One is, A, some musicians in New York did heroin."
12:50;12:52;"Like, why is your reaction to be scandalized?"
12:52;12:56;"Shouldn't your reaction be sympathy or happiness that they're still with us or something?"
12:56;12:57;"Yeah."
12:57;12:59;"I also want to point out that I'm friendly with Albert,"
12:59;13:02;"and there's a period when we kind of lived close to each other,"
13:02;13:06;"and all I ever did with him was go play tennis at the Midtown Tennis Club,"
13:06;13:08;"and we had smoothies."
13:08;13:09;"But anyway."
13:09;13:11;"Wild rock and roller."
13:11;13:12;"That's right."
13:12;13:13;"That didn't make it in the book."
13:13;13:16;"I think I single-handedly destroyed the rock and roll spirit of New York City."
13:16;13:19;"But my point is, like, so people are, like, freaking out about this,"
13:19;13:24;"and, like, A, no surprise, there's been an association of musicians and drugs forever."
13:24;13:28;"B, why are you scandalized and not sympathetic/happy that they survive?"
13:28;13:33;"And then C, the villainization of Ryan Adams as--"
13:33;13:40;"I also find that, like, tough too because I'm sure we all have known people who have had huge difficulties with drugs,"
13:40;13:43;"known people who lost their lives from drugs."
13:43;13:47;"The idea that you could read that and be like, ""Now I know who's good, who's bad."""
13:47;13:50;"I even saw some crazy comment where, because Albert said something,"
13:50;13:52;"I had a feeling I was always going to do heroin since I was 14,"
13:52;13:56;"and I saw somebody be like, ""Oh, typical rich kid glamorizing drugs."""
13:56;13:57;"Oh, for God's sake."
13:57;13:59;"And I just want to be like, ""He did heroin, man."""
13:59;14:05;"Like, whatever compelled him from age 14, whatever that thing was, got him to actually do it."
14:05;14:08;"So, like, chill. He's not--whatever."
14:08;14:13;"In a weird way, I'm watching the response to the Strokes, and again, it's 'cause they went first."
14:13;14:19;"And I'm watching them sort of go through the gauntlet of a weird mirror of what they went through in the first place,"
14:19;14:21;"which is being first."
14:21;14:26;"Like, First Out the Door, all these other bands that are contemporaries of theirs,"
14:26;14:28;"are about to get read about too, hopefully."
14:28;14:31;"You know, I hope people will be interested in reading the book in general."
14:31;14:34;"And I think those stories are just as compelling."
14:34;14:38;"And they're going to be weirdly protected because the Strokes went first."
14:38;14:40;"And it's just like, ""God, sorry, guys."""
14:40;14:46;"Like, you know, once again, you know, 'cause I've talked to the members of these different bands"
14:46;14:50;"as the ramp-up has been going on, and, you know, they're nervous."
14:50;14:54;"And there's a sense of kind of apprehension, but there's also a sense of excitement."
14:54;14:59;"And it's sort of--I do feel a kind of like, ""Just wait. Just--this is all--this is--"""
14:59;15:03;"You know, I'm sorry that this is, like, repeating itself as it did in the time."
15:03;15:05;"- Right, and also classic, you know, classic internet."
15:05;15:07;"- Yeah. - Sometimes you see a headline."
15:07;15:11;"And the headline in the New York Magazine thing, I think, was slightly designed to annoy people"
15:11;15:15;"because it said, ""How come the Strokes didn't become the biggest band in the world?"""
15:15;15:21;"So then immediately that plants the seed, ""Oh, it was enough just to be Rich Kids, Uptown Manhattan."
15:21;15:23;"You also wanted to be the biggest band in the world."""
15:23;15:26;"And then you actually read it, and clearly they had some weird mixed feelings about it."
15:26;15:28;"- Yeah. - And they had industry people who had different designs."
15:28;15:30;"So when you actually read it, I read it."
15:30;15:34;"Now when I read it as a musician, I'm like, ""They're not sitting there saying, 'We were the best,"
15:34;15:36;"and we needed to be the best.'"" - At all."
15:36;15:38;"- It's--people were always a little jealous of the Strokes."
15:38;15:41;"Even me as a high school kid in New Jersey, I remember the Strokes coming out"
15:41;15:44;"and being like, ""They're only, what, four or five years older than me?"""
15:44;15:46;"And seeing, like, this wave of enthusiasm."
15:46;15:49;"And even me having--like, being a kid who, like, wanted to be a musician,"
15:49;15:53;"be like--not jealous, but that feeling of, ""What's this all about?"""
15:53;15:55;"You know, like, you get a little hater--a tiny bit haterish."
15:55;15:57;"- Skepticism. - Skepticism."

18:05;18:06;"Hi."
18:06;18:07;"Hey, Despot."
18:07;18:08;"Hey."
18:08;18:09;"Welcome back."
18:09;18:11;"Thanks. It's great to be back."
18:11;18:13;"I'm so happy to be back in New York"
18:13;18:14;"with my New York co-hosts."
18:14;18:15;"Yeah, whatever."
18:15;18:16;"[laughter]"
18:16;18:17;"What?"
18:17;18:18;"I already talked about this."
18:18;18:19;"What'd you say?"
18:19;18:20;"Catch me up."
18:20;18:21;"I said sometimes life and love"
18:21;18:23;"take you to different places,"
18:23;18:25;"but I still am a New York resident."
18:25;18:26;"I come here."
18:26;18:28;"You haven't taken good care of the city"
18:28;18:29;"while I've been gone,"
18:29;18:30;"I can say that much."
18:30;18:31;"[laughter]"
18:31;18:32;"What's wrong with it?"
18:32;18:34;"Now they got an avocado-ria in Sunset Park."
18:34;18:37;"They tore down the NYU Fitness Center."
18:37;18:39;"What's an avocado-ria?"
18:39;18:41;"It's that place that you and your hipster friends"
18:41;18:42;"built in Sunset Park."
18:42;18:44;"It's the world's first avocado bar."
18:44;18:46;"No, that's got to be the most L.A. thing"
18:46;18:47;"in New York City."
18:47;18:48;"[laughter]"
18:48;18:51;"New York and L.A. are just one giant city."
18:51;18:53;"Okay, we can talk about this later,"
18:53;18:56;"but Despot, so Lizzie wrote a book,"
18:56;18:57;"Meet Me in the Bathroom,"
18:57;18:59;"Rebirth in Rock and Roll New York City,"
18:59;19:01;"2001 to 2011, and I was thinking,"
19:01;19:03;"I'm kind of interested on your take"
19:03;19:06;"because you're an OG New Yorker,"
19:06;19:09;"and you're also involved in the music industry,"
19:09;19:11;"but you're not a rocker."
19:11;19:13;"Terrible at guitar."
19:13;19:15;"Can hardly hold down a beat on drums."
19:15;19:16;"You're a rapper."
19:16;19:17;"I wouldn't say that."
19:17;19:20;"I mean, rappers are pretty good"
19:20;19:22;"with percussive things."
19:22;19:23;"Okay, that's true."
19:23;19:25;"I'm not good at that."
19:25;19:27;"You can't play slide guitar?"
19:27;19:28;"No."
19:28;19:30;"Barely know any Led Zeppelin deep cuts?"
19:30;19:32;"Actually, that might not be true."
19:32;19:33;"That's why I don't."
19:33;19:35;"When you hear Rock and Roll New York City,"
19:35;19:36;"2001 to 2011,"
19:36;19:38;"what does that make you think of?"
19:38;19:39;"Was that a good time for you?"
19:39;19:41;"When you saw the Strokes and the Yeas coming out,"
19:41;19:44;"did it fill you with pride as a New Yorker,"
19:44;19:45;"or you were just like,"
19:45;19:46;"I don't give a f***?"
19:46;19:49;"I'd say probably mostly the latter."
19:49;19:51;"Did you like the Strokes?"
19:51;19:52;"Not really."
19:52;19:54;"I didn't dislike the Strokes."
19:54;19:56;"I was pretty indifferent."
19:56;19:58;"I noticed that everybody liked the Strokes."
19:58;20:01;"That is the alternate title of the book."
20:01;20:04;"I noticed everybody liked the Strokes."
20:04;20:05;"I noticed that everybody liked the Strokes."
20:05;20:06;"That's volume two."
20:06;20:07;"Volume two."
20:07;20:09;"That could be the movie, maybe."
20:09;20:10;"Yeah, there you go."
20:10;20:11;"Totally."
20:11;20:13;"Detective Despot."
20:13;20:20;"I think more than being from New York or whatever,"
20:20;20:26;"it was just in 2001, I was 19."
20:26;20:29;"It kind of felt like,"
20:29;20:32;"hey, people who are famous for making music"
20:32;20:35;"are sort of close to my age,"
20:35;20:36;"and I like that."
20:36;20:38;"Did you ever see them around?"
20:38;20:39;"Were you ever at the same bars?"
20:39;20:42;"Yeah, I did see those guys around."
20:42;20:43;"Did you have words?"
20:43;20:45;"I don't think so."
20:45;20:47;"I think I probably met, you know,"
20:47;20:50;"some of the people from the scene you're talking about."
20:50;20:53;"I was at Max Fish all the time,"
20:53;20:56;"and that's, I guess, where a lot of people were."
20:56;20:58;"And yeah, people would be like,"
20:58;21:00;"hey, this guy, you should meet this guy"
21:00;21:02;"because you make music."
21:02;21:06;"And then I would meet them, I guess."
21:06;21:08;"Did you go to any of the shows?"
21:08;21:10;"I think I saw a Strokes show once."
21:10;21:14;"I definitely saw some Yeah Yeah Yeah shows."
21:14;21:15;"What else was there?"
21:15;21:16;"Like Blonde Redhead?"
21:16;21:17;"I went to one of those."
21:17;21:18;"Oh yeah?"
21:18;21:19;"Is Blonde Redhead in the book?"
21:19;21:20;"They're not."
21:20;21:21;"They're a little too early."
21:21;21:22;"Yeah, they're kind of,"
21:22;21:23;"yeah, I guess they start in the '90s."
21:23;21:25;"Which is to say they're old."
21:25;21:27;"I'm calling them old."
21:27;21:28;"Definitely not."
21:28;21:31;"I mean, the Strokes were massive Blonde Redhead fans."
21:31;21:33;"Everyone around New York at that particular time."
21:33;21:34;"But like--"
21:34;21:35;"Blonde Redhead was sick."
21:35;21:36;"But they're still going on."
21:36;21:37;"Totally."
21:37;21:38;"They've kind of--"
21:38;21:39;"Yeah, it's a--"
21:39;21:40;"I think of them as more--"
21:40;21:42;"It makes me think of a different era."
21:42;21:44;"They just played a show."
21:44;21:46;"They played a show in Greenpoint last week."
21:46;21:47;"Yeah, they're doing--"
21:47;21:48;"I mean, they're amazing."
21:48;21:52;"Yeah, they're more like the indie, artsy universe."
21:52;21:54;"Universe."
21:54;21:56;"Which is what New York rock was."
21:56;21:59;"# Tell me where you've seen my life"
21:59;22:00;"# I look in your eyes"
22:00;22:04;"# I can only see where you left the black show"

33:32;33:34;"Okay, so we understand why you started in 2001."
33:34;33:36;"Why did you end in 2011?"
33:36;33:39;"Because that was the time when I got the idea for the book."
33:39;33:43;"The book ends with the then final LCD Sound System show"
33:43;33:46;"at Madison Square Garden and the strokes--"
33:46;33:48;"Oh, so you wrote your whole book to be like,"
33:48;33:50;"""And then LCD Sound System bowed out gracefully"
33:50;33:52;"at Madison Square Garden."""
33:52;33:53;"And then the mother--"
33:53;33:56;"Did you take a big sip of coffee"
33:56;33:58;"before you saw the news that they were back?"
33:58;34:00;"I was like, ""This was inevitable."""
34:00;34:01;"No, it's awesome."
34:01;34:03;"I mean, it actually is perfect 'cause it's like--"
34:03;34:05;"it shows the accelerated culture that we--"
34:05;34:06;"Life is meaningless."
34:06;34:07;"Yes, that's right."
34:07;34:10;"It's basically--I was like, ""I knew it. I knew it."""
34:10;34:13;"Like, all that existentialism coursework in college"
34:13;34:15;"pays off now that I see nothing matters."
34:15;34:16;"That's a little postscript."
34:16;34:17;"Yeah, postscript."
34:17;34:20;"P.S., guys, great talking to you. Nothing matters."
34:20;34:22;"Two years later, LCD reunited."
34:22;34:23;"I do."
34:23;34:26;"Strokes still talking spicy. Nothing matters."
34:26;34:29;"And there's an avocado-ria in Sunset Park."
34:29;34:31;"The end of the book is those two shows,"
34:31;34:32;"which happened in like a really--"
34:32;34:34;"it was the same couple of days,"
34:34;34:37;"and I went to both, and I was just like,"
34:37;34:38;"""Wait, what?"""
34:38;34:40;"It probably shouldn't have taken that long to dawn on me,"
34:40;34:41;"but it was like something about--"
34:41;34:44;"I remember at the LCD Sound System show"
34:44;34:48;"that I saw Susan Sarandon, who's like my hero,"
34:48;34:50;"and she was sitting--I was on the floor,"
34:50;34:52;"and she was sitting in like good seats near the--"
34:52;34:53;"and I was just like--"
34:53;34:55;"I spent the entire LCD Sound System show"
34:55;34:58;"watching Susan Sarandon respond to LCD Sound System,"
34:58;35:02;"and there was something about doing that weird,"
35:02;35:04;"creepy stalker thing--"
35:04;35:06;"Sorry, Susan, love you--"
35:06;35:09;"and also seeing the Strokes who I'd known, you know,"
35:09;35:12;"like forever and had sort of seen"
35:12;35:14;"through all these different permutations"
35:14;35:16;"on that stage being like rock stars."
35:16;35:18;"Like, they just looked so rock star-y,"
35:18;35:21;"and the whole--I was just like, ""Something's over."""
35:21;35:22;"Like, the thing that my--"
35:22;35:24;"I mean, I'm a contemporary of theirs,"
35:24;35:25;"so like I had kind of grown up--"
35:25;35:30;"my entire personal story syncs up with the story of the band."
35:30;35:32;"I was in my 20s in New York City,"
35:32;35:34;"so it was kind of like, ""Oh."""
35:34;35:36;"And not over necessarily in a bad way,"
35:36;35:40;"but over like this is a really firm closing of the door"
35:40;35:43;"to one--this doesn't feel like it's happening right now anymore."
35:43;35:44;"It's not evolving in the same way."
35:44;35:47;"These are like establishment rock stars now."
35:47;35:50;"These are like my generation's establishment artists."
35:50;35:52;"They're--Susan Sarandon is watching that--"
35:52;35:53;"I don't know."
35:53;35:55;"It really--and so I was like, ""Oh, I know."
35:55;35:57;"I should think about how to write about this,"""
35:57;35:59;"and then a short six years later, there's a book."
35:59;36:01;"- But I guess--I don't know."
36:01;36:03;"That's interesting to me 'cause I feel like--"
36:03;36:07;"do you think there's something associated with a scene like that"
36:07;36:09;"can only be kind of truly authentic"
36:09;36:10;"as it's getting to that point,"
36:10;36:13;"and once you get to the MSG show,"
36:13;36:15;"even if it hadn't been a farewell show--"
36:15;36:17;"- Right. - The idea that, you know,"
36:17;36:20;"once you're at that level, it's not a scene anymore."
36:20;36:21;"It's the mainstream."
36:21;36:23;"- Yeah, I think that's fair."
36:23;36:25;"I mean, I always--the word ""authentic,"""
36:25;36:28;"like, I don't know--I always am like,"
36:28;36:30;"""Why does it have to be--and I'm not--it's not--"
36:30;36:32;"you're not necessarily meaning it that way."""
36:32;36:33;"- Sure, no, air quotes ""authentic."""
36:33;36:34;"- Right, because it's like--"
36:34;36:36;"it's authentic when it's mainstream, too."
36:36;36:37;"It's just authentically mainstream."
36:37;36:40;"I mean, ""People's Connection,"" I'm anti the whole"
36:40;36:42;"""It's small and it's good and it's big and it's bad"" thing,"
36:42;36:43;"obviously."
36:43;36:44;"I think that's ridiculous."
36:44;36:45;"I've never fully understood it."
36:45;36:47;"There's so many big things that are terrible"
36:47;36:49;"and so many small things that are terrible."
36:49;36:50;"If that were really the metric,"
36:50;36:52;"we would be in a different situation,"
36:52;36:55;"but yeah, it did feel sort of like--"
36:55;36:57;"there's a line in the book that Albert says--"
36:57;36:59;"I'm being excerpt, I actually can't remember--"
36:59;37:00;"but basically about, like--"
37:00;37:02;"I think he's talking about before they released"
37:02;37:03;"""Is This It?"""
37:03;37:04;"It may have been the EP,"
37:04;37:05;"but I'm pretty sure it's ""Is This It?"""
37:05;37:07;"And he's just like, ""That was the best time."""
37:07;37:09;"Like, right--because we kind of knew--"
37:09;37:11;"you're starting to realize, like,"
37:11;37:13;"""Maybe we have something rad."""
37:13;37:15;"And it's like, nobody else really knows yet,"
37:15;37:16;"and it hasn't fully blown up,"
37:16;37:19;"and he talks about--I mean, Albert's an amazing--"
37:19;37:20;"- Rat contour."
37:20;37:23;"- Rat contour and, like, emotional honesty person."
37:23;37:25;"I mean, he goes really deep, obviously,"
37:25;37:28;"as everyone knows from the excerpt on the drug stuff,"
37:28;37:30;"but he's also really, like, sort of thoughtful"
37:30;37:32;"about his own experience of all this,"
37:32;37:33;"and he says--he's basically like,"
37:33;37:35;"""We had this thing, we were excited to share it,"""
37:35;37:38;"and it's like that--he remembers walking down the street"
37:38;37:39;"with the other guys in the band"
37:39;37:41;"and feeling like this gang and that energy"
37:41;37:42;"of, ""We made this thing,"
37:42;37:43;"and we're gonna share it with the world,"""
37:43;37:44;"and, like, ""Isn't that great?"""
37:44;37:46;"And that, in a way, that was the best moment."
37:46;37:49;"- That's a classic thing that comes up a lot in life,"
37:49;37:52;"not just for the Albert Hammonds of the world,"
37:52;37:54;"but for--it's interesting, like,"
37:54;37:58;"the best part is the part before."
37:58;38:00;"You're waiting for something to come,"
38:00;38:04;"and once it gets there, you're kind of like, ""Whatever."""
38:04;38:06;"I mean, when I think of--"
38:06;38:08;"eh, I could go both ways on that."
38:08;38:10;"- Yeah, I mean, how do you feel about that?"
38:10;38:12;"- Yeah, don't you have a perspective of--"
38:12;38:14;"do you identify with that, or do you feel like"
38:14;38:17;"it was a different kind of trajectory for you guys?"
38:17;38:18;"- Well, it's tough."
38:18;38:20;"I mean, maybe everybody feels this way a little bit,"
38:20;38:24;"because I feel like my youth into manhood"
38:24;38:27;"kind of also coincided with so many other changes."
38:27;38:29;"Maybe everybody feels this way a bit."
38:29;38:32;"Okay, so for instance, when I turned 18,"
38:32;38:34;"it was five months after 9/11,"
38:34;38:35;"so it's, like, already corresponding"
38:35;38:37;"with a major shift in the world."
38:37;38:39;"So already, like, now I'm an adult."
38:39;38:41;"I could buy cigarettes."
38:41;38:42;"Chose not to."
38:42;38:43;"Don't get it twisted, though."
38:43;38:45;"I could do that right now if I wanted to."
38:45;38:47;"But, you know, I'm like, I'm an adult,"
38:47;38:50;"but also this other massive thing changed in the world,"
38:50;38:53;"and so I'm also kind of processing that."
38:53;38:56;"And then when I was, like, leaving college,"
38:56;38:58;"you know, Facebook and all that stuff launched."
38:58;39:00;"I remember, like--well, I was probably, like,"
39:00;39:01;"a junior in college."
39:01;39:02;"I started at Columbia."
39:02;39:04;"We were in the first school, so it's like,"
39:04;39:07;"kind of as I'm transitioning out of college"
39:07;39:09;"into, like, working life,"
39:09;39:11;"also, like, social media and the Internet"
39:11;39:14;"is, like, massively changing all this stuff, too."
39:14;39:17;"So anyway, sometimes when I look back,"
39:17;39:20;"and I'm like, ""Oh, wasn't it nice when I was that age?"""
39:20;39:24;"I can't tell if I'm longing for time gone by"
39:24;39:27;"or if it's also partially because"
39:27;39:28;"things literally have changed"
39:28;39:31;"and, like, made the world better and worse."
39:31;39:32;"And--yeah, I don't know."
39:32;39:33;"- Different. - Different."
39:33;39:35;"So sometimes that gets confusing,"
39:35;39:37;"where it's kind of like if you got divorced"
39:37;39:39;"on the day Trump was elected,"
39:39;39:42;"and somebody was like, ""What was the years like that?"""
39:42;39:44;"After, you'd be like, ""Was it 'cause of the divorce?"
39:44;39:45;"Or 'cause of--I don't know."""
39:45;39:47;"Yeah, like, what's the starting point?"

58:25;58:27;"Alright, in 1999, right?"
58:27;58:29;"Biggest year of the music industry."
58:29;58:30;"Uh-huh. Yay, Britney."
58:30;58:35;"I was 17. I was an up-and-coming rapper in New York City."
58:35;58:37;"And I played a show at Tramps."
58:37;58:45;"And this woman-- there was one extremely huge New York rap label at the time."
58:45;58:48;"I don't really want to say what it was, but they were like--"
58:48;58:50;"Wait, an independent or a--?"
58:50;58:51;"Nah."
58:51;58:57;"So whatever, they offered me this deal, and I was still not an adult."
58:57;59:03;"So whatever, I took these phone calls, and I had to have a meeting with them."
59:03;59:11;"And at the meeting, they explained to me-- I'm saying this because I was very much like--"
59:11;59:16;"I hate major labels. I hate the shiny suit era of rap music."
59:16;59:19;"I hate all this. I was-- because I was 17."
59:19;59:26;"And looking back on it, I wish I had a different attitude about it."
59:26;59:27;"And I went--"
59:27;59:29;"Those shiny suits were not that bad."
59:29;59:31;"They look good now, right? They're shiny."
59:31;59:32;"What's not to like?"
59:32;59:39;"So we had this thing, and I knew this phrase that I think I heard on some terrible underground rap song."
59:39;59:42;"I knew the phrase ""creative control."""
59:42;59:46;"And I was like, ""I want creative control."" That was my thing."
59:46;59:49;"I was like, ""I need that. And if I don't have that, I can't do this."""
59:49;59:52;"And they were like, ""Well, you definitely can't have that."""
59:52;59:53;"[laughter]"
59:53;59:54;"That's what they're paying for."
59:54;59:59;"They were like, ""People are going to write songs for you. You're going to rap the songs."
59:59;01:00:03;"They're going to figure out who's going to be on the songs with you, and that's going to be your album."""
01:00:03;01:00:08;"And I remember they said, ""Your first album is the sacrificial lamb,"
01:00:08;01:00:12;"and the second one you might be able to write a hook or something."""
01:00:12;01:00:15;"And I was like, ""No, I hate you."" And that was it."
01:00:15;01:00:19;"And it didn't happen, but it probably would have been a million dollars or something."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"So you're saying you regret that?"
01:00:21;01:00:22;"I regret that."
01:00:22;01:00:26;"Because now, as an adult, not only would I have probably gotten the million dollars"
01:00:26;01:00:30;"and got dropped immediately and kept it, because it would have been in advance,"
01:00:30;01:00:35;"and we could have used that money, my family."
01:00:35;01:00:42;"And also, hilarious story to tell, had I put out that one single and been like, ""Yeah, that's me."""
01:00:42;01:00:47;"Okay, but the only problem is if the album actually came out and somehow it was a hit,"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"and you were humiliated, then you might become like--"
01:00:49;01:00:51;"I think that, no. I wouldn't be humiliated."
01:00:51;01:00:56;"Vanilla Ice, he seemed to be so humiliated by his career that he spent the next 30 years being like,"
01:00:56;01:01:00;"""Yo, that was some f---ed up s---. No, that's not me. I just did it for the money. F--- you."""
01:01:00;01:01:04;"But I think me and Vanilla Ice are very different people. I would have been like, ""Yeah."""
01:01:04;01:01:06;"That's what he would have said. I don't know."
01:01:06;01:01:09;"Well, no, that's easy to say. Yeah, I don't know."
01:01:09;01:01:11;"First of all, it would have been hilarious."
01:01:11;01:01:14;"I'm already picturing the record, because they would have probably let you write a few bars."
01:01:14;01:01:20;"But if they didn't let you write any hooks, this is like 1999, you're 17."
01:01:20;01:01:24;"I'm thinking of the Mirror Masterpiece Kid rap in early Bout."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"There definitely would have been some song from him."
01:01:26;01:01:29;"There is another kid. There is a kid who became who I would have been."
01:01:29;01:01:30;"Who took your spot. Yeah."
01:01:30;01:01:32;"They went on to the next white kid."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"And it didn't work out for him at all."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"What was his name?"
01:01:34;01:01:35;"Well, then I'm--"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"Okay, we don't need to put him on the list."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"I'm just saying, I can already picture--"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"Also, how many young white rappers are here in 1999?"
01:01:41;01:01:45;"Definitely one of your first two singles would have been a girl on the hook"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"with a kind of sassy attitude being like--"
01:01:47;01:01:48;"In a shanty trap?"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"I just was going to say it's a shanty for sure."
01:01:50;01:01:52;"No, but this is like a shanty junior, junior."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"Yeah. She's got to be younger."
01:01:54;01:01:56;"A shanty was kind of like grown up."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"Can't have that."
01:01:57;01:02:00;"This would have been like somebody being like--"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"It would have been like a teenage love story."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"And I'd be rapping like, ""Hey girl."""
01:02:04;01:02:06;"""Hey, despot, I don't want to date you."""
01:02:06;01:02:08;"""Why, girl? I don't hate you."""
01:02:08;01:02:11;"Like, ""I Got a Man,"" like the Positive K song."
01:02:11;01:02:12;"It would be something like that."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"Yeah."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"But a junior version."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"Now I want to hear this."
01:02:15;01:02:18;"That song also came out and it was the other kid."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"With the other kid."
01:02:19;01:02:20;"That happened."
01:02:20;01:02:22;"""Hey, despot."""
01:02:22;01:02:23;"Or it'd be like--"
01:02:23;01:02:24;"Or the opposite."
01:02:24;01:02:26;"I think that's the Lil' Romeo song was that the girl--"
01:02:26;01:02:27;"Yeah."
01:02:27;01:02:28;"""I don't want a girlfriend."""
01:02:28;01:02:30;"Oh, no. It was the Jackson 5 where she said--"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"""Oh, Romeo, give me a chance."""
01:02:32;01:02:34;"""Uh-uh, Tia, I don't need a girlfriend."""
01:02:34;01:02:35;"""I don't want a girlfriend."""
01:02:35;01:02:37;"""Oh, despot."""
01:02:37;01:02:39;"""Oh, despot, be my--"""
01:02:39;01:02:42;"""Oh, despot, be my boyfriend."""
01:02:42;01:02:43;"""No thanks."""
01:02:43;01:02:44;"Yeah, something like that."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"""No thanks."""
01:02:45;01:02:46;"""I don't really feel like it."""
01:02:46;01:02:48;"""I need creative control."""
01:02:48;01:02:51;"""No thanks. I want creative control."""
01:02:51;01:02:55;"""Hey, despot, this is the biggest year for the music industry."
01:02:55;01:02:57;"Take that check, come get with me."""
01:02:57;01:03:00;"""Nah, I want--"
01:03:00;01:03:02;"Nah, Tia, I want creative control."""
01:03:02;01:03:04;"That's the story of my life."
01:03:04;01:03:05;"Big mistake."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"""Oh, Romeo, give me a chance."""
01:03:07;01:03:09;"""Uh-uh, Tia, I don't need a girlfriend."""
01:03:09;01:03:13;"""I don't want a girlfriend."""
01:03:13;01:03:17;"""Oh, Romeo, the cutest boy I know."""
01:03:17;01:03:18;"""I know, I know."""
01:03:18;01:03:23;"""So let me be your best friend."""
01:03:23;01:03:26;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:03:26;01:03:29;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beast."
01:03:29;01:03:30;"One."
01:03:30;01:03:35;"These days, if you were 23 and you had released a corny major label,"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"""Uh-uh, Tia,"" album,"
01:03:37;01:03:40;"and people were like, ""Oh, that's corny. I don't like despot,"""
01:03:40;01:03:42;"you could turn that around with one song."
01:03:42;01:03:43;"That's what I'm saying."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"One SoundCloud song."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"And it would've came out when I was 18,"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"so I would've had, you know, whatever."
01:03:48;01:03:49;"It would've been fine."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"And I would've had a bunch of money."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"That's right."
01:03:52;01:03:55;"Also, it seems like the attitude is different now with--"
01:03:55;01:03:57;"I don't know if it's streaming or if it's whatever,"
01:03:57;01:04:00;"but the concept of selling out is a different concept."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"That's literally a chapter in the book."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"Literally."
01:04:03;01:04:06;"Like, that idea just disappeared."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"And the sort of-- and how that happened,"
01:04:08;01:04:10;"it's-- obviously, we know how that happened."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"But just, it seems--"
01:04:12;01:04:14;"I think, actually, Rostam talks about, in the book,"
01:04:14;01:04:18;"about being so fascinated about the idea of--"
01:04:18;01:04:20;"like, someone was telling him in school or something, like,"
01:04:20;01:04:22;"""I really want to sign to a major."""
01:04:22;01:04:25;"And he's like, ""I was so interested in anyone caring about that."""
01:04:25;01:04:28;"Like, I wanted to talk more to this person about that idea"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"because, like, these ancient, dying corporations"
01:04:30;01:04:32;"are still holding interest to you,"
01:04:32;01:04:35;"whereas, like you're saying, I mean, a mere few years earlier--"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"That was in the Empire Strikes Back phase."
01:04:37;01:04:38;"Yes."
01:04:38;01:04:41;"Just to bring us back to how this all makes sense,"
01:04:41;01:04:43;"let's return to what we all understand"
01:04:43;01:04:45;"is the Empire Strikes Back metaphor."
01:04:45;01:04:46;"But yeah."
01:04:46;01:04:48;"Is the Vampire Weekend section of the book where it gets boring?"
01:04:48;01:04:49;"It's the--"
01:04:49;01:04:50;"[laughs]"
01:04:50;01:04:51;"No, you can keep it real."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"I mean, we did this interview years ago."
01:04:53;01:04:54;"I just, like, when I'm picturing--"
01:04:54;01:04:55;"Oh, my God."
01:04:55;01:04:59;"--the strokes and, like, the crazy stories and stuff--"
01:04:59;01:05:03;"Do you consider crazy stories to be the only source of entertainment?"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"No."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"Cheap thrills."
01:05:08;01:05:09;"Um..."
01:05:09;01:05:12;"Yeah."
01:05:12;01:05:14;"Then you might be in trouble."
01:05:14;01:05:15;"[laughs]"
01:05:15;01:05:16;"You might be in trouble."
01:05:16;01:05:20;"I mean, there's a difference between something being entertaining and edifying."
01:05:20;01:05:24;"There's a few books I read at school that I'm glad they forced me to read it"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"because it gave wisdom to my life."
01:05:26;01:05:29;"You're asking if the Vampire Weekend section is the, like,"
01:05:29;01:05:32;"Grapes of Wrath of the chapter."
01:05:32;01:05:33;"[laughs]"
01:05:33;01:05:34;"Vampire Weekend section is just, like--"
01:05:34;01:05:37;"Fine, dust bowl-like Jesus."
01:05:37;01:05:38;"I guess it's important."
01:05:38;01:05:39;"I don't know."
01:05:39;01:05:40;"That's the math section."
01:05:40;01:05:42;"That's the math section of the SAT of this."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"Right, exactly."
01:05:44;01:05:45;"No, I don't think so."
01:05:45;01:05:46;"Wait, so who do you--"
01:05:46;01:05:47;"Okay."
01:05:47;01:05:52;"So the early part, we're talking strokes, yeah, yeahs, interpol."
01:05:52;01:05:53;"Who else?"
01:05:53;01:05:56;"LC sound system and the formation of DFA, which is pretty dramatic."
01:05:56;01:05:57;"Yeah."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"And then--"
01:05:58;01:05:59;"So is there no--"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"I mean, obviously, White Stripes are not New York, but--"
01:06:01;01:06:02;"They're in there."
01:06:02;01:06:03;"I mean, Jack's in the book."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"I feel like they were a big part of the scene,"
01:06:05;01:06:08;"even though they weren't here as far as I understand."
01:06:08;01:06:11;"The idea was, like, New York City is the main character,"
01:06:11;01:06:17;"and anyone who was here in a way that shaped their story"
01:06:17;01:06:20;"or was influenced deeply by one of these bands--"
01:06:20;01:06:24;"so, like, the Killers are in it because they literally were, like,"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"heard the Strokes EP and were like,"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"""Oh, we have to do things completely differently,"""
01:06:28;01:06:31;"or, you know, and same is true of Kings of Leon,"
01:06:31;01:06:33;"who are also in the book, in addition to having toured with the Strokes."
01:06:33;01:06:36;"I mean, they had a kind of a friendship with those guys, too,"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"but they're relevant in just the straight-up music way"
01:06:39;01:06:43;"because it's like they literally saw that band be successful"
01:06:43;01:06:45;"and changed their idea of what could be possible for them."
01:06:45;01:06:47;"I mean, the Vines are in here."
01:06:47;01:06:48;"The Hives are in here."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"Libertines, Franz Ferdinand."
01:06:50;01:06:52;"Like, I would get this question of, like,"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"""Well, we're not a New York band, so why are you including us?"""
01:06:54;01:06:58;"And it's like, ""Because you are either here because of New York bands or, like--"
01:06:58;01:07:00;"I'm just hoping you're going to start talking spicy."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"[laughter]"
01:07:02;01:07:03;"Let's get spicy."
01:07:03;01:07:05;"Let's get spicy."
01:07:05;01:07:08;"So then the next wave--"
01:07:08;01:07:09;"Yeah, it's Brooklyn."
01:07:09;01:07:12;"I mean, and the transition to Brooklyn and the branding of Brooklyn"
01:07:12;01:07:14;"and the idea of, like, that is even--"
01:07:14;01:07:17;"I mean, also TV on the radio, like, national."
01:07:17;01:07:21;"I mean, yeah, it was kind of bridge earlier."
01:07:21;01:07:22;"Bridge that--"
01:07:22;01:07:23;"Bridge that got--"
01:07:23;01:07:26;"Yeah, because they were in Williamsburg and kind of artier and all that stuff."
01:07:26;01:07:29;"But then, yeah, I mean, Grizzly Bear, you guys."
01:07:29;01:07:30;"Dave Long--"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"Dirty Projectors?"
01:07:31;01:07:32;"Yeah."
01:07:32;01:07:34;"I mean, he's great and so funny."
01:07:34;01:07:35;"And--"
01:07:35;01:07:36;"Spicy?"
01:07:36;01:07:40;"[laughter]"
01:07:40;01:07:41;"Spicy Dave Long show."
01:07:41;01:07:42;"He was pretty spicy."
01:07:42;01:07:43;"You told me this thing."
01:07:43;01:07:46;"Here, this is one thing I'm now remembering that you said."
01:07:46;01:07:47;"You were like--"
01:07:47;01:07:48;"Oh, you interviewed Dave."
01:07:48;01:07:49;"I was like, ""Yeah."""
01:07:49;01:07:52;"You were like, ""Okay, you can send me his quotes, and I'll annotate them for you."""
01:07:52;01:07:53;"True, false."
01:07:54;01:07:55;"I said that?"
01:07:55;01:07:56;"Yes."
01:07:56;01:07:57;"You were kidding, but it was funny."
01:07:57;01:07:58;"That's pretty spicy."
01:07:58;01:07:59;"It was spicy."
01:07:59;01:08:00;"You see?"
01:08:00;01:08:01;"Now that's entertaining."
01:08:01;01:08:02;"That's unusually spicy."
01:08:02;01:08:03;"That's a--"
01:08:03;01:08:04;"You had a moment of spice."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"That's a Three Alarm Chili comment."
01:08:06;01:08:07;"Oh, God."
01:08:07;01:08:08;"[laughter]"
01:08:08;01:08:09;"So cheesy."
01:08:09;01:08:12;"No, because I don't think of Dave as a liar or a charlatan."
01:08:12;01:08:13;"No, you were saying--"
01:08:13;01:08:16;"No, I bet you probably-- I bet this is what-- You probably said something to me."
01:08:16;01:08:18;"Dave said this, and I was like, ""Huh."""
01:08:18;01:08:19;"I don't think I'd interviewed him yet."
01:08:19;01:08:21;"He misrem-- Oh, really?"
01:08:21;01:08:22;"Okay, I don't know."
01:08:22;01:08:23;"We'll find out."
01:08:23;01:08:26;"I might have been in a spicy feud state."
01:12:13;01:12:18;"Why is the book called ""Meet Me in the Bathroom""?"
01:12:18;01:12:22;"What was happening in the bathroom between 2001 and 2011?"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"Come on."
01:12:23;01:12:24;"You know the answer."
01:12:24;01:12:25;"It's just some stuff."
01:12:25;01:12:26;"I mean, it's a Strokes song."
01:12:26;01:12:27;"I stole it from him."
01:12:27;01:12:29;"It's just kind of potty humor."
01:12:29;01:12:30;"You think that's funny?"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"Oh, yeah."
01:12:32;01:12:33;"Yeah."
01:12:33;01:12:34;"It's a--"
01:12:34;01:12:35;"Yes."
01:12:35;01:12:36;"No, I would--"
01:12:36;01:12:37;"Potty humor is the least--"
01:12:37;01:12:41;"Potential readers who don't want to be caught on the subway."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"OK, sorry."
01:12:42;01:12:43;"I cut you off."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"What's the answer?"
01:12:44;01:12:45;"I'm trying to tell--"
01:12:45;01:12:47;"Yes, I'm suggesting that this is actually a bathroom book."
01:12:47;01:12:48;"No."
01:12:48;01:12:49;"I--"
01:12:49;01:12:51;"Here's-- It's New York City, right?"
01:12:51;01:12:52;"Like, there's no privacy."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"It's one of the great things about New York City."
01:12:54;01:12:56;"Like, you see people breaking up on the street."
01:12:56;01:12:57;"You see people crying."
01:12:57;01:12:59;"You see people, like, having the best days of their life."
01:12:59;01:13:03;"And it's sort of like there's this communal sense of--"
01:13:03;01:13:08;"speaking of unity, it's like we're all having our lives in an essentially"
01:13:08;01:13:11;"uncomfortably public way because we've chosen to live in this place"
01:13:11;01:13:12;"where there's no space."
01:13:12;01:13:14;"And we're not really sure why we did that."
01:13:14;01:13:16;"But anyway, I'm going to sob on the subway right now."
01:13:16;01:13:17;"Like, it's fine."
01:13:17;01:13:20;"And I think the bathroom thing is like that's the--"
01:13:20;01:13:23;"Literally, it's the only place you can go in New York"
01:13:23;01:13:25;"where you can be alone or with somebody."
01:13:25;01:13:26;"It's like that's intimacy."
01:13:26;01:13:28;"It's like even in this place of churning."
01:13:28;01:13:29;"Right, just do something illegal."
01:13:29;01:13:30;"Yes."
01:13:30;01:13:31;"Okay, so I like that."
01:13:31;01:13:32;"It's actually--"
01:13:32;01:13:33;"It's sex, drugs, and whatever."
01:13:33;01:13:34;"I like that."
01:13:34;01:13:35;"That's actually a great answer."
01:13:35;01:13:37;"Meet Me in the Bathroom, not only is it a stroke song,"
01:13:37;01:13:39;"it's about the sense--"
01:13:39;01:13:42;"In New York, the bathroom is a site of the sacred."
01:13:42;01:13:43;"It's a profound place."
01:14:25;01:14:26;"All right, guys."
01:14:26;01:14:28;"We've been talking a lot about music"
01:14:28;01:14:32;"and how the next generation of independent artists,"
01:14:32;01:14:35;"a lot of them don't have some of the advantages"
01:14:35;01:14:38;"that even in our crazy time when the music industry"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"seemingly is falling apart, we had--"
01:14:40;01:14:44;"In a time crisis, I mostly just like to talk about Star Wars"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"and see who's talking spicy out there,"
01:14:46;01:14:51;"but it's important to play more music by the next generation."
01:14:51;01:14:52;"We have this platform."
01:14:52;01:14:53;"Let's do it more."
01:14:53;01:14:55;"There's someone who tweeted at me recently"
01:14:55;01:14:57;"because they mistakenly thought we already did play them,"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"but I'm glad this happened."
01:14:59;01:15:01;"This is a band called Super Organism."
01:15:01;01:15:05;"One of the people in the band is 17 years old"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"and is from Maine, and she says the band is her"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"and seven others from London."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"I assume London, England."
01:15:10;01:15:11;"Maybe there's a London man."
01:15:11;01:15:12;"I don't know how that works."
01:15:12;01:15:15;"Bottom line, I said, ""Yeah, hell yeah."
01:15:15;01:15:16;"We're going to play your song."""
01:15:16;01:15:18;"Then she said, ""By the way, I used to write"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"PG-13 Vampire Weekend fan fiction"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"where Rivers Cuomo was your arch enemy"
01:15:22;01:15:25;"because he didn't go to your eighth birthday party"
01:15:25;01:15:26;"at Chuck E. Cheese's."""
01:15:26;01:15:28;"I said, ""Cool. We'll play it."""
01:15:28;01:15:31;"Then she sent me some of the fan fiction."
01:15:31;01:15:32;"I'll just read the beginning."
01:15:32;01:15:38;"This is on some Brandon Flowers, Julian Casablanca's [bleep]"
01:15:38;01:15:41;"Way less cool."
01:15:41;01:15:44;"Ezra and Rivers had been enemies since like third grade."
01:15:44;01:15:45;"They used to be best friends,"
01:15:45;01:15:48;"but it all went nuts on Ezra's tenth birthday party."
01:15:48;01:15:50;"Basically what happened was Rivers didn't come"
01:15:50;01:15:51;"to Ezra's birthday party."
01:15:51;01:15:52;"Instead, he went to some other place"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"with some other people."
01:15:54;01:15:57;"The next day, Rivers told Ezra, ""I was on a field trip."""
01:15:57;01:16:00;"Well, obviously anyone would know he was lying instantly"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"because Ezra's birthday was on a Saturday."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"Who goes on a field trip on a Saturday?"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"Ezra forgave him, but of course still expected"
01:16:06;01:16:09;"a simple sorry or a late birthday gift."
01:16:09;01:16:12;"But Rivers didn't give him anything, not even a sorry."
01:16:12;01:16:14;"Everything was over."
01:16:14;01:16:18;"I assume that this next paragraph she sent"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"is from a different part of the story."
01:16:20;01:16:21;"Must have been five seconds."
01:16:21;01:16:22;"The two were just staring at each other."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"Ezra whispered to me, ""Go sing."""
01:16:24;01:16:26;"Pushing my back, Rivers went all the way"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"to the back of the auditorium without even looking at Ezra,"
01:16:28;01:16:29;"not even once."
01:16:29;01:16:31;"I climbed onto the stage and introduced myself."
01:16:31;01:16:34;"""Hi, I'm Katie Hudson. I'll be singing 'Wasted and Ready.'"""
01:16:34;01:16:37;"Okay, I don't know what that part means."
01:16:37;01:16:39;"I want to know what happens next, though."
01:16:39;01:16:40;"It's pretty good."
01:16:40;01:16:43;"You know, I've never met Rivers Cuomo."
01:16:43;01:16:47;"Well, obviously, now you're going to have to."
01:16:47;01:16:49;"Well, now we're enemies."
01:16:49;01:16:53;"In this world where truth and fiction blend together..."
01:16:53;01:16:55;"Blurred lines and all that, yeah."
01:16:55;01:16:58;"Who's to say that this fan fiction didn't actually happen"
01:16:58;01:16:59;"and I just forgot about it?"
01:16:59;01:17:00;"Right."
01:17:00;01:17:02;"So it seems like probably the Katie Hudson"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"is supposed to be Katy Perry, because do you guys know"
01:17:04;01:17:05;"that's Katy Perry's real name?"
01:17:05;01:17:06;"I did know that."
01:17:06;01:17:08;"Do you know why she changed it?"
01:17:08;01:17:09;"There was another singer?"
01:17:09;01:17:13;"No, there was an actress named Kate Hudson."
01:17:13;01:17:14;"Really?"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"And she was in a film called ""Fool's Gold."""
01:17:16;01:17:18;"And when Katy Perry saw ""Fool's Gold,"""
01:17:18;01:17:22;"she made a vow that she would change her name"
01:17:22;01:17:25;"because she loved the film so much."
01:17:25;01:17:30;"And also, Kate Hudson didn't go to her 10th birthday party."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"Superorganism, check them out."
01:17:32;01:17:34;"This is their song ""It's All Good."""
01:17:34;01:17:38;"Good morning, Orono."
01:17:38;01:17:43;"You are awake."
01:17:43;01:17:54;"The weather today is dark."
01:17:54;01:17:57;"Would you like to get up?"
01:17:57;01:18:00;"It helps."
01:18:00;01:18:19;"You don't, you don't say."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"It is not an easy one."
01:18:21;01:18:35;"I'm not going to lie."
01:18:35;01:18:53;"I'm not going to lie."
01:18:53;01:19:13;"It's all good."
01:19:13;01:19:41;"It's all good."
01:19:41;01:19:43;"Hold up."
01:19:43;01:19:59;"Hold up."
01:19:59;01:20:00;"Oh, yes."
01:20:00;01:20:02;"You're in charge of what you feel."
01:20:02;01:20:04;"And when your life is looking real grim,"
01:20:04;01:20:11;"it's time to scream it."
01:20:11;01:20:14;"It's all good."
01:20:14;01:20:15;"You tell yourself."
01:20:15;01:20:19;"It's all good."
01:20:19;01:20:22;"It's all good."
01:20:22;01:20:24;"Now let's hear it for you."
01:20:24;01:20:31;"It's all, it's all, it's all good."
01:20:31;01:20:35;"It's all good."
01:20:35;01:20:38;"Congratulations."
01:20:38;01:20:47;"It's good."
01:20:47;01:20:49;"You guys ready for the top five?"
01:20:49;01:20:52;"It's time for the top five."
01:20:52;01:20:56;"Five on iTunes."
01:20:56;01:20:57;"This is what we do on this show."
01:20:57;01:20:59;"We listen to the top five songs on iTunes"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"and then we talk about the zeitgeist."
01:21:01;01:21:03;"Okay."
01:21:03;01:21:06;"I wonder if any band from New York 2001,"
01:21:06;01:21:09;"2011 has ever been in the top five songs on iTunes."
01:21:09;01:21:11;"Top five albums, certainly."
01:21:11;01:21:13;"Maybe, but maybe not."
01:21:13;01:21:15;"You don't think maps ever made it there at some point?"
01:21:15;01:21:17;"No, because iTunes wasn't popping."
01:21:17;01:21:21;"Yeah, part of the problem that we're having is that iTunes wasn't iTunes at that point."
01:21:21;01:21:25;"But I just imagine like there's so many shows now that like,"
01:21:25;01:21:28;"I feel like songs got big for like a week or something like that."
01:21:28;01:21:31;"When they're placed in the right moment and the right song."
01:21:31;01:21:33;"They don't make it to the top five, man."
01:21:33;01:21:35;"The Jedi returned."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"The Jedi has returned."
01:21:37;01:21:40;"I applaud your like doggedness about this metaphor."
01:21:40;01:21:42;"Like you are not letting it go."
01:21:42;01:21:43;"I mean, I have to."
01:21:43;01:21:44;"You're sticking with it."
01:21:44;01:21:47;"The number five song right now on iTunes."
01:21:47;01:21:49;"We're not doing a comparative one this week."
01:21:49;01:21:51;"That's too deep."
01:21:51;01:21:53;"Save that for Jake back in California."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"What does that mean?"
01:21:54;01:21:55;"You think like we're dumb?"
01:21:55;01:21:56;"Yeah."
01:21:57;01:22:01;"I just think we know because I just think we've had so much to catch up about."
01:22:01;01:22:05;"Why make the top five a two hour experience?"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"Let's just bang it out."
01:22:07;01:22:09;"Take me to the king."
01:22:09;01:22:11;"The voice performances by Chris blue."
01:22:11;01:22:14;"So this is the type of stuff Asher that makes it to the top five."
01:22:14;01:22:18;"It's not like a random indie track."
01:22:18;01:22:20;"It's like it's like something from the voice."
01:22:20;01:22:22;"So this is a voice performance."
01:22:22;01:22:23;"This isn't a cover."
01:22:23;01:22:24;"Yeah, it was."
01:22:24;01:22:27;"It's written by Kirk Franklin, originally performed by to Mellon man."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"Okay."
01:22:28;01:22:31;"I don't know if you guys watch the voice, but this person, Chris blue."
01:22:31;01:22:33;"Is on team Alicia keys."
01:22:33;01:22:36;"I mean, Alicia keys have chosen him."
01:22:36;01:22:43;"Truth is I'm tired."
01:22:43;01:22:47;"Options are few."
01:22:47;01:22:51;"I'm trying to pray."
01:22:51;01:22:55;"But where are you?"
01:22:55;01:22:58;"I'm all church."
01:22:58;01:23:05;"And spicy."
01:23:05;01:23:08;"I can't fake."
01:23:08;01:23:15;"Take me to the key."
01:23:15;01:23:21;"I don't have much to."
01:23:21;01:23:24;"My heart."
01:23:24;01:23:44;"It's my."
01:23:44;01:23:45;"Okay."
01:23:45;01:23:49;"Please take me to the."
01:23:49;01:23:53;"Truth is."
01:23:53;01:23:55;"That was a lot of thoughts."
01:23:55;01:23:57;"Does he want to die?"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"That's a good question."
01:23:59;01:24:01;"Right? Because."
01:24:01;01:24:05;"It seemed like this wants to win the voice."
01:24:05;01:24:07;"And then, you know, first of all,"
01:24:07;01:24:12;"We have to be careful here because it's interesting with cultural."
01:24:12;01:24:14;"Products that are related to faith."
01:24:14;01:24:16;"Because."
01:24:16;01:24:19;"Sometimes it can be hard to judge something that's like deeply rooted in"
01:24:19;01:24:20;"religion."
01:24:20;01:24:22;"Because you also want to judge it as a cultural work,"
01:24:22;01:24:25;"but maybe Kirk Franklin would be like, it's not about understanding it."
01:24:25;01:24:27;"You know, this is praise music."
01:24:27;01:24:28;"And I love a lot of praise music."
01:24:28;01:24:31;"What genre is it in on iTunes?"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"Christian and gospel."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"That's why you bring up a good point."
01:24:35;01:24:38;"I'm confused about what the narrator of this song."
01:24:38;01:24:40;"Is looking for."
01:24:40;01:24:44;"Yeah. Like what if it was just called, please kill me now or something."
01:24:44;01:24:47;"And then people wouldn't be like, wow, it's beautiful."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"But that's what he's saying. I think."
01:24:49;01:24:50;"Please kill me."
01:24:50;01:24:52;"Despot's guide to Christian and gospel music."
01:24:52;01:24:54;"2001 to 2011."
01:24:54;01:24:55;"The beginning."
01:24:55;01:24:56;"The singer."
01:24:56;01:24:58;"Was describing having a tough time."
01:24:58;01:25:01;"Things were looking kind of rough."
01:25:01;01:25:03;"And he was all churched out."
01:25:03;01:25:05;"I like that."
01:25:05;01:25:06;"I really like that."
01:25:06;01:25:10;"So that's interesting because that's like an interesting topic for a song."
01:25:10;01:25:12;"If you're a good church going person."
01:25:12;01:25:15;"And you can apply that to any faith, you follow the rules of your faith."
01:25:15;01:25:19;"You show up to your house of worship, your sacred site."
01:25:19;01:25:23;"And you, you follow the rules, but you know, inside,"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"it's not fulfilling you spiritually."
01:25:25;01:25:26;"That's a tough position to be in."
01:25:26;01:25:29;"People don't talk about that enough because sometimes it could be awkward to,"
01:25:29;01:25:34;"you know, say to another person at church or, or mosque or synagogue."
01:25:34;01:25:36;"You feeling anything?"
01:25:36;01:25:38;"I'm tapped out and I feel horrible."
01:25:38;01:25:39;"So that's an interesting thing."
01:25:39;01:25:42;"So I understand that that's a really good starting place."
01:25:42;01:25:45;"I love that, but I'm just confused about what the chorus is."
01:25:45;01:25:48;"Who is he talking to? Because he says, take me to the king."
01:25:48;01:25:49;"Is God the king?"
01:26:01;01:26:08;"And no, and I know that often King can be interchangeable with God or some type of Godhead type figure."
01:26:08;01:26:11;"The only thing that confused me is when he says, take me to the king,"
01:26:11;01:26:13;"but then something about your glory."
01:26:13;01:26:14;"He's creating a certain character."
01:26:14;01:26:18;"No, didn't he say he wants to, he wants to bask in the King's glory, I believe."
01:26:29;01:26:30;"Yeah, the King's glory, man."
01:26:30;01:26:31;"Okay, yeah, no, no, that's fair."
01:26:31;01:26:32;"I guess, yeah, all right."
01:26:32;01:26:35;"I was just confused because look, I've done that."
01:26:35;01:26:36;"Everybody's done that."
01:26:36;01:26:40;"Sometimes in a song you switch like the object."
01:26:40;01:26:45;"This guy, God, in this faith, he's three guys anyway, isn't he?"
01:26:45;01:26:46;"That's true."
01:26:46;01:26:51;"So like the son takes him to the father probably, and then the Holy Ghost does something too."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"That's true."
01:26:52;01:26:55;"You drop some deep, real religious knowledge."
01:26:55;01:26:57;"No, it's true because God takes different forms."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"A lot of religions have that."
01:26:58;01:27:03;"Like God takes, so he's saying, God, take me to, take me to the king."
01:27:03;01:27:04;"Take me to God."
01:27:04;01:27:08;"Take me to a certain aspect of yourself and let me look at your glory."
01:27:08;01:27:09;"Okay, I get it."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"I was just confused about it."
01:27:10;01:27:11;"He wants to hang out with God."
01:27:11;01:27:12;"Yeah."
01:27:12;01:27:13;"Right."
01:27:13;01:27:14;"That's what this song is about, right?"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"But this one's taking a very dark view."
01:27:16;01:27:18;"He's ready to die."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"Take me to the king."
01:27:20;01:27:25;"A little more about Chris Blue, the singer, 27 year old from Knoxville, Tennessee."
01:27:25;01:27:26;"That's a great town."
01:27:26;01:27:28;"And he grew up in a family of seven."
01:27:28;01:27:31;"They were in a band called the Blue Family that sang at local churches."
01:27:31;01:27:33;"Now I understand the song better."
01:27:33;01:27:35;"Thanks guys for helping me understand that."
01:27:35;01:27:38;"And shout out to Chris Blue because he's got a great voice."
01:27:38;01:27:42;"So do you think like, I don't watch The Voice."
01:27:42;01:27:46;"I don't know if anybody here watches The Voice, but like, is this an operation now where it's like,"
01:27:46;01:27:54;"this guy sang this song like yesterday and they're already prepared to have this single out that night"
01:27:54;01:27:56;"or like the next morning on iTunes."
01:27:56;01:27:57;"Yeah, they get it."
01:27:57;01:27:58;"I think they get it out real quick."
01:27:58;01:28:02;"They know that the performance was good or they have it ready to go in case it's good."
01:28:02;01:28:05;"And then people just buy that."
01:28:05;01:28:08;"Like when a new Star Wars movie is coming out, they get the-"
01:28:08;01:28:09;"Or like when-"
01:28:09;01:28:10;"You get the Happy Meal toy."
01:28:10;01:28:13;"When the two teams are in the World Series, they make all the merch."
01:28:13;01:28:14;"Yeah, it's like that."
01:28:14;01:28:20;"And they, you know, if they don't win, all of it gets shipped to like a third world country and they wear it."
01:28:20;01:28:21;"Take me to the king."
01:28:21;01:28:22;"Yeah."
01:28:22;01:28:28;"Okay, now I also want to point this out because it's interesting how sometimes you see these little narratives in the top five."
01:28:28;01:28:30;"So that's a song about faith."
01:28:30;01:28:34;"It's about hitting rock bottom, being confused about how to express your faith,"
01:28:34;01:28:39;"and then finally wanting to go directly to God, having some kind of confrontation."
01:28:39;01:28:41;"So in some ways, it's like a selfless song."
01:28:41;01:28:42;"It's about like surrender."
01:28:42;01:28:44;"You might just want to talk to him."
01:28:44;01:28:45;"You might not want to talk to him."
01:28:45;01:28:46;"Okay."
01:28:46;01:28:47;"He might not stay."
01:28:47;01:28:48;"He's just hanging for the night."
01:28:48;01:28:50;"He wants to pop in, but I'm just saying like-"
01:28:50;01:28:51;"Meet in the bathroom."
01:28:51;01:28:52;"That's a song-"
01:28:52;01:28:54;"Yeah, he wants to meet him in the sacred bathroom."
01:28:54;01:28:59;"Right, but that's a song about being at your lowest point and looking for a way to connect with your faith."
01:28:59;01:29:07;"The next song we're going to listen to is called ""I'm the One"" featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper, DJ Khaled."
01:29:07;01:29:10;"Will this song feature God?"
01:29:10;01:29:11;"We're about to find out."
01:29:11;01:29:20;"I don't think I knew what this song was called."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"Nah, I didn't."
01:29:22;01:29:27;"It's a good song."
01:29:27;01:29:29;"Definite song of the summer."
01:29:29;01:29:30;"Yeah, you love this?"
01:29:30;01:29:31;"Callin' it."
01:29:31;01:29:32;"Well, it's just, it sounds-"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"You already know it's going to be a song of the summer."
01:29:34;01:29:37;"Basically, ""Cheerleader,"" just different versions."
01:29:37;01:29:44;"This is an Uber song, right? I do hear this in Uber."
01:29:44;01:29:45;"Yeah, I like it."
01:29:45;01:29:46;"It's an Uber song?"
01:29:46;01:29:49;"Yeah. I guess I must have first heard this in Uber."
01:29:49;01:29:53;"I should have known what it was called, too, because I keep saying it."
01:29:53;01:29:54;"It's the only word."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"You thought it was called ""Away Up""?"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"I thought it was ""Away Up."""
01:29:59;01:30:01;"I'm the one that hit that same spot"
01:30:01;01:30:04;"She the one that bring them raindrops"
01:30:04;01:30:07;"We go back, remember, crisscross and hopscotch"
01:30:07;01:30:10;"You the one that hold me down when the block's hot"
01:30:10;01:30:13;"I make your dreams come true when you wake up"
01:30:13;01:30:16;"And your looks just the same without no makeup"
01:30:16;01:30:19;"Had to pull up on your mama, see what you made of"
01:30:19;01:30:22;"Ain't got a word 'bout them comers 'cause my cake up"
01:30:22;01:30:25;"You can ride inside my life on that Fame Bus"
01:30:25;01:30:28;"'Cause I promise when we step out, you'll be famous"
01:30:28;01:30:31;"Modern day bunny and clout, what they name those"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"'Cause when we pull up, brr, brr, all angles"
01:30:33;01:30:36;"Yeah, you're looking at the truth, the money never lie"
01:30:36;01:30:38;"No, I'm the one, yeah"
01:30:38;01:30:43;"I'm the one early morning in the car, I know you wanna ride now"
01:30:43;01:30:44;"I'm the one, yeah"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"I'm the one, yeah"
01:30:46;01:30:49;"Hear you sick of all those other imitators"
01:30:49;01:30:51;"Don't let the only real one intimidate you"
01:30:51;01:30:53;"You know Quavo's real name is Quavious?"
01:30:53;01:30:55;"Yeah, I heard that. Quavious Marshall."
01:30:55;01:30:57;"You know what Chance's name is?"
01:30:57;01:30:59;"Uh, Chance."
01:30:59;01:31:01;"Chance the Rapper."
01:31:01;01:31:03;"Chance-alert."
01:31:03;01:31:05;"What's Justin Bieber's real name?"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"Chance the Rapper."
01:31:07;01:31:09;"I'm the only one, okay though"
01:31:09;01:31:12;"She beat her face out with that new Chanel"
01:31:12;01:31:15;"She like the price, she see the ice and make her make her melt"
01:31:15;01:31:18;"When I met her in the club, I asked her who she felt"
01:31:18;01:31:21;"Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt"
01:31:21;01:31:25;"Yeah, I'm the one. It's a good song, it makes you feel good."
01:31:25;01:31:29;"You know, it's also like funny, Lizzy, I don't know if you feel this way, like"
01:31:29;01:31:34;"Obviously you're gonna talk about the resonance of September 11th, how that made people feel"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"About the music at that time in New York"
01:31:36;01:31:39;"But at the end of the day, the strokes are already on their way, popping"
01:31:39;01:31:42;"There's a huge element of just like randomness with everything"
01:31:42;01:31:46;"And like sometimes we look for these clues"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"Like even now, like somebody could be like"
01:31:48;01:31:53;"In Trump's America, to have such like a greedy liar in power"
01:31:53;01:31:57;"It actually became very unfashionable in pop music to brag about money and stuff"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"No, of course not. That's not true."
01:31:59;01:32:01;"It's like cultural Monday morning"
01:32:01;01:32:02;"Definitely not true"
01:32:02;01:32:03;"That'll never be right"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"It's like cultural Monday morning quarterbacking"
01:32:05;01:32:08;"Where you're like, I can reverse engineer why this happened"
01:32:08;01:32:10;"Or I can explain, I'm gonna just sit on, you know"
01:32:10;01:32:12;"I know why this happened, it's because I can"
01:32:12;01:32:14;"And you can always make the point one way or another too"
01:32:14;01:32:16;"Because it could be like, in Trump's America"
01:32:16;01:32:21;"It's even more important for people who don't like Trump"
01:32:21;01:32:24;"And are different from Trump to assert that he's not the one"
01:32:24;01:32:25;"They're the one"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"And we mean that not the one"
01:32:27;01:32:32;"No, right, whatever argument you want to endorse"
01:32:32;01:32:34;"You can find the evidence to endorse that argument"
01:32:34;01:32:37;"Which is why like when Trump was elected and everyone was like"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"At least rock will be great again"
01:32:39;01:32:42;"It's like, no, no, I mean, A, not worth it"
01:32:42;01:32:45;"Right, exactly, you could paint a whole long narrative about"
01:32:45;01:32:50;"Like, yeah, in Trump's America, people wanted to rock out again"
01:32:50;01:32:53;"Or maybe people would just be like"
01:32:53;01:32:56;"When people saw Trump up there dancing to Rolling Stones songs"
01:32:56;01:32:59;"It made a whole generation of people never want to pick up a guitar again"
01:32:59;01:33:02;"Sure, and that's clearly the reason"
01:33:02;01:33:04;"That's the moment that that happened, whatever it is"
01:33:04;01:33:06;"Although I will say that I did want to listen"
01:33:06;01:33:11;"I mean, this is a really chipper, cheery, happy song"
01:33:11;01:33:15;"And they're like escapist, right, escapist music, escapist"
01:33:15;01:33:19;"I know, people always say that too, just like, you know, when things get like really raw"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"There's more escapist music on the radio"
01:33:21;01:33:26;"And some part of me is like, you know, when I think about just about every year of my life"
01:33:26;01:33:29;"There's always been a sad person on the radio"
01:33:29;01:33:32;"And some happy person on the radio"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"There's always been a big dumb fantasy movie"
01:33:34;01:33:37;"Literally my entire life, since I was a kid"
01:33:37;01:33:40;"Okay, let's say since I was 13"
01:33:40;01:33:44;"The biggest movies have been Harry Potter for a decade"
01:33:44;01:33:47;"Into like more Star Wars, Twilight"
01:33:47;01:33:51;"When was the time when there weren't like big fantasy movies"
01:33:51;01:33:54;"When was the time when there weren't big escapist fantasy movies"
01:33:54;01:33:56;"Or singles or whatever"
01:33:56;01:33:59;"The truth is that life is meaningless"
01:33:59;01:34:00;"As we've discussed"
01:34:00;01:34:03;"No, and it's that people always want escapism"
01:34:03;01:34:06;"Because they're not giving us anything else, I don't know"
01:34:06;01:34:10;"I did read something though, that in pop music, like the top"
01:34:10;01:34:14;"I guess probably it was a little while ago, so maybe it was 2015, not '16, I forgot"
01:34:14;01:34:20;"That the BPM is like considerably lower for like the average of all the popular songs for that year"
01:34:20;01:34:23;"That's because of Trap and Tropical House"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"And Trapical House"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"And don't forget about"
01:34:27;01:34:29;"Tropical House, is that what you said?"
01:34:29;01:34:32;"That was the time when we started getting a lot of trap music"
01:34:32;01:34:33;"A lot of Tropical House"
01:34:34;01:34:37;"And Trop, there's a lot of Trop"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"Hotline Bling, Rachel Platt"
01:34:39;01:34:42;"Also with trap music, it also depends how you measure it"
01:34:42;01:34:45;"Because a lot of people would say that trap is slow music"
01:34:45;01:34:46;"Because you count it half time"
01:34:46;01:34:47;"Right, with the snares"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Like, whatever"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"But you could also count it like"
01:34:51;01:34:54;"You could think of it as double time, you could dance to it double time"
01:34:54;01:34:56;"Because sometimes I get in this bubble too"
01:34:56;01:34:59;"Like I'm making an album now, you start going down this wormhole of being like"
01:34:59;01:35:02;"At this moment, should the music be happy?"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"Or should it be sad?"
01:35:04;01:35:07;"And should it be fast? Should it be slow?"
01:35:07;01:35:10;"And the answer is like, if it's good"
01:35:10;01:35:12;"Honestly, at the end of the day, it's like"
01:35:12;01:35:15;"Make sure your clothes look right, that's all that matters"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"In music, and that's a big part"
01:35:17;01:35:20;"The Strokes had the full package"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"They look great"
01:35:22;01:35:24;"And they had great songs, but"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"At the end of the day, if the songs are good"
01:35:27;01:35:30;"Then, rather than worrying about how fast it should be"
01:35:30;01:35:31;"Or this and that"
01:35:31;01:35:34;"And I'm not saying that I've done this well, arguably I've done it poorly"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"I probably should have put more stuff"
01:35:36;01:35:37;"Tell us more"
01:35:37;01:35:38;"I'm just saying that"
01:35:38;01:35:42;"The tempo is less important than clothes"
01:35:42;01:35:45;"Oh my god"
01:35:45;01:35:46;"Alright, truth"
01:35:46;01:35:48;"I feel like that's correct"
01:35:48;01:35:51;"The music is less important than clothes"
01:35:51;01:35:54;"No, I didn't say that, the songs and the clothes are equal"
01:35:54;01:35:56;"But the tempo doesn't matter"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"People get it twisted because they're always like"
01:35:58;01:36:01;"What about in the 80s when you had a guy like Phil Collins?"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"Phil Collins is handsome"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"People talk about"
01:36:05;01:36:08;"You know what, in some ways, it's like the exception that proves the rule"
01:36:08;01:36:11;"People sometimes talk about Phil Collins"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"Like he's not conventionally attractive"
01:36:13;01:36:17;"Yeah, maybe he was a little more balding"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"Than most male pop stars today"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"But he was good looking"
01:36:21;01:36:25;"And he had muscular arms from all the years of drumming"
01:36:25;01:36:30;"You really studied Phil Collins' aesthetic presentation"
01:36:30;01:36:32;"I can't stand this argument where sometimes people are like"
01:36:32;01:36:36;"You know, people get so hung up on looks and clothes and music"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"But think about Phil Collins or Adele"
01:36:38;01:36:41;"And Adele is, I don't want to take anything away from her"
01:36:41;01:36:45;"The fact that maybe in some ways she's not the conventional beauty norm"
01:36:45;01:36:48;"But she's beautiful, she photographs really well"
01:36:48;01:36:51;"Both of these people, by the way, are great songwriters, great performers"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"I'm not undercutting that at all"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"I'm just saying Phil Collins and Adele are both good looking"
01:36:55;01:36:56;"That's all I want to say"
01:36:56;01:36:57;"They're both good looking people"
01:36:57;01:37:03;"You're saying there's not this golden age where we're more appreciative of unattractive people"
01:37:03;01:37:06;"Attractive people are always in style"
01:37:06;01:37:09;"And music and culture and anybody who's going to be in front of a camera"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"Like, okay, maybe in radio"
01:37:11;01:37:15;"In the days of radio where that was your entertainment"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"Then maybe you didn't need to know how somebody looked"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"Now they want to put cameras everywhere"
01:37:19;01:37:20;"Yeah"
01:37:20;01:37:22;"Yeah, the only thing is you're allowed to"
01:37:22;01:37:23;"Susan Boyle though"
01:37:23;01:37:26;"Okay, Susan Boyle, when she first came out"
01:37:26;01:37:29;"People did not find her conventionally attractive"
01:37:29;01:37:31;"She got a makeover, I don't know"
01:37:31;01:37:34;"Alright, so there's one or two exceptions"
01:37:34;01:37:36;"And I'm not saying this is my personal take"
01:37:36;01:37:38;"It's also a little offensive when people are like"
01:37:38;01:37:40;"I mean, look at Phil Collins"
01:37:40;01:37:41;"And it's like, what?"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"What about Phil Collins?"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"These are good looking people"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"But again, I'm not trying to say they didn't do their thing"
01:37:47;01:37:50;"And helping to maybe shake up certain norms"
01:37:50;01:37:53;"It just didn't shake them up all that much"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"Where did this come from?"
01:37:55;01:37:56;"I have no idea"
01:37:56;01:37:57;"Excellent question"
01:37:57;01:37:59;"This came from the top five songs on iTunes"
01:37:59;01:38:02;"It's time for the top five"
01:38:02;01:38:06;"Five on iTunes"
01:38:06;01:38:08;"We're talking about Bubblegum, maybe"
01:38:08;01:38:09;"Was someone ugly?"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"I don't know where the Phil Collins part came from"
01:38:11;01:38:14;"Everyone's pretty attractive in this song"
01:38:14;01:38:17;"Yeah, this is an attractive person song"
01:38:17;01:38:20;"That's true"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"But that fits the vibe that we're even talking about"
01:38:22;01:38:24;"It's escapism, that's how we got here"
01:38:24;01:38:27;"And you were saying, essentially, escapism is always in style"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"Because humans are alive"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"And therefore they need sad songs and happy songs"
01:38:31;01:38:32;"And escapist songs"
01:38:32;01:38:34;"And that might trend one way or another"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"Based on whatever political persuasions"
01:38:36;01:38:38;"But people are still"
01:38:38;01:38:40;"I always think of those studies where it's like"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"There's been a horrible natural disaster somewhere"
01:38:42;01:38:45;"And it's like, there's sort of this media coverage"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"Of like, real life is happening to these people"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"A terrible thing has happened"
01:38:49;01:38:51;"Psychologists will talk about going to talk to people"
01:38:51;01:38:53;"In that situation"
01:38:53;01:38:54;"And it's still"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"I can't get a hold of my boyfriend"
01:38:56;01:38:58;"And I wonder if he doesn't like me anymore"
01:38:58;01:39:00;"And it's like, I can't, you know"
01:39:00;01:39:03;"It's still regular human problems of pop"
01:39:03;01:39:05;"That's still what permeates the human psyche"
01:39:05;01:39:06;"No, of course"
01:39:06;01:39:09;"In any circumstance, even trumping, no pun intended"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"The most extreme supposed disasters"
01:39:11;01:39:14;"Where you're going to get close to God, speaking of"
01:39:14;01:39:16;"And really see the truth about life"
01:39:16;01:39:18;"No, of course, because all of those things"
01:39:18;01:39:20;"Are part of the fabric of human experience"
01:39:20;01:39:22;"So escapism is always relevant"
01:39:22;01:39:23;"You know, if you've got a boyfriend"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"Who looks like Phil Collins"
01:39:25;01:39:26;"And you can't find him"
01:39:26;01:39:27;"You're going to freak out"
01:39:27;01:39:28;"You're panicked, man"
01:39:28;01:39:29;"And you know why?"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"Because Phil Collins is a good looking man"
01:39:31;01:39:33;"I feel like it makes particular sense now, obviously"
01:39:33;01:39:36;"Like, I feel like one thing that's always in May is"
01:39:36;01:39:39;"It always seems like there's a couple of artists"
01:39:39;01:39:40;"That are all trying to post up"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"What they think the song of the summer is going to be"
01:39:42;01:39:44;"And this is like right around the time"
01:39:44;01:39:46;"Where that hooks into people"
01:39:46;01:39:47;"This is when it happens"
01:39:47;01:39:48;"So I feel like it's always really interesting"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"To listen to the radio and stuff now"
01:39:50;01:39:51;"Because it feels like everyone's kind of like"
01:39:51;01:39:52;"Bringing out their big gun"
01:39:52;01:39:54;"Like, this sounds like a song"
01:39:54;01:39:56;"That they've been sitting on for a while"
01:39:56;01:39:58;"Knowing like, we need to wait till May"
01:39:58;01:40:00;"If this is going to be the song of the summer"
01:40:00;01:40:01;"And we just need to release it"
01:40:01;01:40:03;"Yeah, it just feels like this is the escape song"
01:40:03;01:40:05;"That people are going to be like"
01:40:05;01:40:06;"At a barbecue going crazy for"
01:40:06;01:40:08;"I know, but it's always from"
01:40:08;01:40:10;"I just wish the world was"
01:40:10;01:40:11;"That doesn't make it bad"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"I just wish the world had more surprises"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"Maybe one year's song of the summer"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"Could be made by a grandma"
01:40:17;01:40:18;"Okay"
01:40:18;01:40:19;"Alright"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"I feel like we're good on surprises right now"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"Like, I'm feeling okay about surprises"
01:40:23;01:40:25;"Yeah, there's something really like"
01:40:25;01:40:28;"Comforting about this song"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"It feels like an Obama-era song"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"Like, I just watch the West Wing right now"
01:40:32;01:40:34;"I just watch the West Wing and The Wire"
01:40:34;01:40:35;"Those are the things that I do"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"Shows that begin with W"
01:40:37;01:40:39;"And those shows make you feel good?"
01:40:39;01:40:40;"Yeah"
01:40:40;01:40:42;"Devastated, Inner City, Baltimore"
01:40:42;01:40:45;"And The White House?"
01:40:45;01:40:46;"Yeah"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"I just rewatched The Wire"
01:40:48;01:40:49;"It was good"
01:40:49;01:40:50;"Isn't it amazing?"
01:40:50;01:40:51;"Pretty good"
01:40:51;01:40:52;"It holds up"
01:40:52;01:40:54;"Sopranos is a lot better"
01:40:54;01:40:55;"That's true"
01:40:55;01:40:58;"Sopranos is the best show"
01:40:58;01:40:59;"Ever"
01:40:59;01:41:00;"Of that time"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"Do you talk about The Sopranos at all in your book?"
01:41:02;01:41:04;"I wonder if they come up"
01:41:04;01:41:05;"There was like"
01:41:05;01:41:06;"That was popping around that same time"
01:41:06;01:41:07;"I don't think it's not a big thing"
01:41:07;01:41:08;"But there was a"
01:41:08;01:41:10;"I don't think this made it in the final draft"
01:41:10;01:41:12;"But there was like a conversation about"
01:41:12;01:41:13;"Again, in the digital stuff"
01:41:13;01:41:17;"About people all going to watch"
01:41:17;01:41:18;"I don't know"
01:41:18;01:41:20;"Or meeting after the finale of The Sopranos"
01:41:20;01:41:22;"At like a particular bar"
01:41:22;01:41:23;"And this sort of sense of like"
01:41:23;01:41:26;"Pre-social media community"
01:41:26;01:41:28;"Of wanting to go be around other humans"
01:41:28;01:41:29;"To talk about"
01:41:29;01:41:30;"Cause it's so"
01:41:30;01:41:33;"It was really actually quite a long time ago"
01:41:33;01:41:34;"And it was a shocking ending"
01:41:34;01:41:35;"Yeah, there was no Twitter yet"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"Right, and so you couldn't get on Twitter"
01:41:37;01:41:38;"And be like"
01:41:38;01:41:39;"Oh my god, is Tony dead?"
01:41:39;01:41:40;"You know"
01:41:40;01:41:41;"Instead you had to like"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"Get out of"
01:41:42;01:41:43;"Put pants on"
01:41:43;01:41:45;"Go to a place that's outside"
01:41:45;01:41:47;"And like see other human beings"
01:41:47;01:41:48;"And discuss it"
01:41:48;01:41:49;"But that never made"
01:41:49;01:41:50;"I don't think that's in the book"
01:41:50;01:41:51;"So that's a little outtake"
01:41:51;01:41:52;"Is he dead though?"
01:41:52;01:41:53;"I don't know"
01:41:53;01:41:54;"That ending though was filmed"
01:41:54;01:41:56;"In the ice cream shop in our town"
01:41:56;01:41:57;"No way"
01:41:57;01:41:58;"Across the street"
01:41:58;01:41:59;"Oh yeah, we grew up going to that"
01:41:59;01:42:00;"Across our hood"
01:42:00;01:42:01;"So did you know then?"
01:42:01;01:42:02;"Like having sussed out the vibe"
01:42:02;01:42:03;"In that shop"
01:42:03;01:42:04;"Yeah, they tell you there"
01:42:04;01:42:05;"They know what happened there"
01:42:05;01:42:06;"Yeah"
01:42:06;01:42:07;"No, but it was just really weird"
01:42:07;01:42:08;"Cause like we'd spend so much time"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"At that little ice cream diner place"
01:42:10;01:42:11;"Growing up, Holston's"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"The number three song on iTunes chart"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"Is another voice performance"
01:42:15;01:42:16;"This one is by"
01:42:16;01:42:17;"Despot's already shaking his head"
01:42:17;01:42:18;"You know man"
01:42:18;01:42:20;"You know what I don't appreciate about"
01:42:20;01:42:22;"Dominating the top five like that"
01:42:22;01:42:23;"The weird thing is"
01:42:23;01:42:24;"Do any of these people become actual stars?"
01:42:24;01:42:25;"No"
01:42:25;01:42:26;"Yes"
01:42:26;01:42:27;"Who?"
01:42:27;01:42:28;"Name one voice star"
01:42:28;01:42:29;"Yeah"
01:42:29;01:42:30;"Kelly Clogson"
01:42:30;01:42:31;"Was she on the voice?"
01:42:31;01:42:32;"That's American Idol"
01:42:32;01:42:33;"You know that's the American Idol?"
01:42:33;01:42:34;"That was literally 20 years ago"
01:42:34;01:42:35;"First of all"
01:42:35;01:42:36;"There's not one"
01:42:36;01:42:37;"If you gotta think about it"
01:42:37;01:42:38;"American Idol made a ton of stars"
01:42:38;01:42:39;"Some of the guys from The Strokes"
01:42:39;01:42:40;"Started out on that"
01:42:40;01:42:41;"Okay, her name is"
01:42:41;01:42:42;"Team Adam"
01:42:42;01:42:43;"Guys, her name is Lauren Duskey"
01:42:43;01:42:44;"And she's on Team Blake"
01:42:44;01:42:45;"That's Blake Lively"
01:42:45;01:42:46;"Who's one of the hosts on The Voice"
01:42:46;01:42:47;"And this song is called"
01:42:47;01:42:48;"Ghost in the House"
01:42:48;01:42:49;"Originally performed by Shenandoah"
01:42:49;01:42:50;"Guess what genre music it is"
01:42:50;01:42:51;"It's a song called Ghost in the House"
01:42:51;01:42:52;"And it's a song by"
01:42:52;01:42:53;"The Strokes"
01:42:53;01:42:54;"And it's a song by"
01:42:54;01:42:55;"The Strokes"
01:42:55;01:42:56;"And it's a song by"
01:42:56;01:42:57;"The Strokes"
01:42:57;01:42:58;"And guess what genre music it is"
01:42:58;01:42:59;"Hip hop"
01:42:59;01:43:00;"Oh"
01:43:00;01:43:01;"She's 25 years old"
01:43:01;01:43:02;"And from Michigan"
01:43:02;01:43:03;"I don't pick up the mail"
01:43:03;01:43:04;"I don't pick up the phone"
01:43:04;01:43:05;"But I don't even hear"
01:43:05;01:43:06;"these voice songs in Ubers"
01:43:06;01:43:07;"Yeah, 'cause it's just"
01:43:07;01:43:08;"getting bought"
01:43:08;01:43:09;"I don't even hear"
01:43:09;01:43:10;"the door"
01:43:10;01:43:11;"I don't even hear"
01:43:11;01:43:12;"the door"
01:43:12;01:43:13;"I don't even hear"
01:43:13;01:43:14;"the door"
01:43:14;01:43:15;"I don't even hear"
01:43:15;01:43:16;"the door"
01:43:16;01:43:17;"I don't even hear"
01:43:17;01:43:18;"the door"
01:43:18;01:43:19;"I don't even hear"
01:43:19;01:43:20;"the door"
01:43:20;01:43:21;"I don't even hear"
01:43:21;01:43:22;"the door"
01:43:22;01:43:23;"I don't even hear"
01:43:23;01:43:24;"the door"
01:43:24;01:43:25;"I don't even hear"
01:43:25;01:43:26;"the door"
01:43:26;01:43:27;"I don't even hear"
01:43:27;01:43:28;"the door"
01:43:28;01:43:29;"I don't even hear"
01:43:29;01:43:30;"the door"
01:43:30;01:43:31;"I just assume"
01:43:31;01:43:32;"be alone"
01:43:32;01:43:33;"I like her voice"
01:43:33;01:43:34;"It should be a separate category"
01:43:34;01:43:35;"of the top ten"
01:43:35;01:43:36;"that's just voice songs"
01:43:36;01:43:37;"Yeah, it's true"
01:43:37;01:43:38;"No disrespect to Lauren Duskey"
01:43:38;01:43:39;"We hope you win"
01:43:39;01:43:40;"Shout out to your coach"
01:43:40;01:43:41;"Blake Lively"
01:43:41;01:43:42;"But we do not want to"
01:43:42;01:43:43;"hear more voice stuff right now"
01:43:43;01:43:44;"And now let's hear the number two song"
01:43:44;01:43:45;"on iTunes"
01:43:45;01:43:46;"Miley Cyrus"
01:43:46;01:43:47;"I'm mad at her"
01:43:47;01:43:48;"Okay, Despot"
01:43:48;01:43:49;"Do you want to explain"
01:43:49;01:43:50;"why you're mad at her"
01:43:50;01:43:51;"for people who didn't"
01:43:51;01:43:52;"catch that controversy"
01:43:52;01:43:53;"a couple weeks ago?"
01:43:53;01:43:54;"Yeah, she said that"
01:43:54;01:43:55;"she's not a fan"
01:43:55;01:43:56;"of rap music anymore"
01:43:56;01:43:57;"because she finds it"
01:43:57;01:43:58;"vulgar and offensive"
01:43:58;01:43:59;"and it's like, my man"
01:43:59;01:44:00;"you like taped"
01:44:00;01:44:01;"a hundred dildos"
01:44:01;01:44:02;"to yourself"
01:44:02;01:44:03;"and took your"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"out and like"
01:44:04;01:44:05;"your dad got mad at you"
01:44:05;01:44:06;"Not that there's"
01:44:06;01:44:07;"anything wrong with that"
01:44:07;01:44:08;"It's fine that you did that"
01:44:08;01:44:09;"but now all the"
01:44:09;01:44:10;"you know, a lot of people"
01:44:10;01:44:11;"are looking at it"
01:44:11;01:44:12;"as like, okay"
01:44:12;01:44:13;"you got what you wanted"
01:44:13;01:44:14;"out of rap music"
01:44:14;01:44:15;"and now you're"
01:44:15;01:44:16;"on it"
01:44:16;01:44:17;"because you're an ass"
01:44:17;01:44:18;"That's a very well made point"
01:44:18;01:44:19;"Yeah, you can really"
01:44:19;01:44:20;"argue with that point"
01:44:20;01:44:21;"You kind of nailed that"
01:44:21;01:44:22;"Yeah"
01:44:22;01:44:23;"I'm just like,"
01:44:24;01:44:29;"- Yeah, you're a nice (beep) Miley Cyrus."
01:44:29;01:44:35;"- ♪ I always thought I would sing, so I never swang. ♪"
01:44:35;01:44:42;"- This is just as on point in the evolution of the pop star as the first stage. Like,"
01:44:42;01:44:45;"this is what that person does next. It's like, whoa, whoa."
01:44:45;01:44:48;"- Yeah, it's the hero's journey. - It's the hero's journey."
01:44:48;01:44:52;"- Now, this is the ""Empire Strikes Back."" - Well, it depends on-"
01:44:52;01:44:55;"- No, this is ""Return of the Jedi."" - Yeah, it's definitely ""Return of the Jedi."""
01:44:55;01:44:58;"- It's one of the movies. - The problem is-"
01:44:58;01:45:00;"- It's a Star Wars. - I know the problem with my metaphor is"
01:45:00;01:45:06;"that it would be a lot more interesting. ""Star Wars"" paints a rosy picture of how stuff goes"
01:45:06;01:45:13;"down because it ends with the Jedis returning. In real life, it goes ""Star Wars,"" the Jedi"
01:45:13;01:45:17;"strikes back, ""Return of the Empire."" That's real life."
01:45:17;01:45:25;"- I hate it. I'm not mad at this song, but it sounds like I should be mad at Miley."
01:45:25;01:45:29;"- I haven't even heard this in a while. - What is this song? Like, what is she-"
01:45:29;01:45:31;"What do we think she's doing here? - It's called ""Malibu."""
01:45:31;01:45:33;"- This is what I think she's doing. - I wouldn't call it country."
01:45:33;01:45:38;"- I have a theory about this song. There's- Do you know this video that's- I mean, probably"
01:45:38;01:45:42;"one of my favorite videos on the internet that I feel like goes viral over and over"
01:45:42;01:45:50;"again that's this video of Stevie Nicks singing backstage. You know that one? Singing ""Wild"
01:45:50;01:45:54;"Heart."" But like an earlier version that's combined with another Fleetwood Mac song and"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"people keep discovering and falling in love with it."
01:45:56;01:46:00;"- It's almost better than the studio version. - Yeah, it's way better than the studio version."
01:46:00;01:46:05;"It's amazing. It combines another song with it and I feel like I can see her in that moment"
01:46:05;01:46:09;"just like obsessing over this video and like, ""I gotta make my version of this song."""
01:46:09;01:46:12;"- I see that. I was thinking this is her making like an Eagles song."
01:46:12;01:46:17;"- Yeah. - Like a carefree road trip, like looking"
01:46:17;01:46:24;"out at the desert or whatever. But you're a loser and you never did."
01:46:24;01:46:29;"So she has no real experience to speak from except for taping a bunch of dildos for herself."
01:46:29;01:46:34;"- Wait, did she actually tape dildos for herself? - I don't know. She did wear some weird dildo."
01:46:34;01:46:39;"She wore like a crocheted strap on. - That's fine. It's cool. I think, you know"
01:46:39;01:46:41;"what the problem is? - How old is she? Do we know how old she is?"
01:46:41;01:46:44;"- I don't know. - 23, 24?"
01:46:44;01:46:49;"- I mean, right on time. I'm just saying this is right on time. It's like discovering"
01:46:49;01:46:53;"feminism your sophomore year of college or something. It's like, ""Oh, wait a second."
01:46:53;01:46:58;"Hold on. Some stuff is bad."" - And then getting a job at a bank that like,"
01:46:58;01:47:00;"you know, there's just like some ill to women globally."
01:47:00;01:47:03;"- Yeah. - I'm not going to take it into one of my"
01:47:03;01:47:06;"classic reveries. - You really want to."
01:47:06;01:47:09;"- No, I don't want to. No, that stuff happens. It's like..."
01:47:09;01:47:16;"- I don't think her trying to go mellow country girl, like sort of earth mom driving at the"
01:47:16;01:47:20;"Pacific Coast Highway is not... It's just on time for her."
01:47:20;01:47:21;"- Sure. - I don't dislike the song."
01:47:21;01:47:23;"- But you can still think she's an ass... - I do."
01:47:23;01:47:28;"- Those statements are pretty wild because... You know what? It's also, it's creating these"
01:47:28;01:47:33;"false dichotomies. Again, people got to go from one extreme to the other because deep down,"
01:47:33;01:47:40;"has there not been like... It's not just that she wrote a song about chilling out and finding"
01:47:40;01:47:47;"herself. She used this as a specific palette that to some people reads as white or country"
01:47:47;01:47:54;"or something as if some of the greatest chill out music of all time has not come from rap."
01:47:54;01:47:57;"You know what I mean? That's just so stupid because also if she wanted to say,"
01:47:58;01:48:02;"I was honestly shocked by it because... - Yes."
01:48:02;01:48:05;"- Sorry, you can keep going. - No, no, no. What do you want to say"
01:48:05;01:48:10;"about my... Do you like... You stand up in front? - No, but I do find it interesting that this song,"
01:48:10;01:48:17;"that like this is a very highly anticipated single and the... What's his name? One Direction."
01:48:17;01:48:19;"- Billy Ray Cyrus. - Harry Styles."
01:48:19;01:48:25;"- Harry Styles. That was also a very highly anticipated single and they both dropped,"
01:48:25;01:48:29;"I don't know, like two, three weeks away from each other or a month or whatever. And I feel"
01:48:29;01:48:34;"like it's a similar vibe. It almost feels like there's... I don't want to be too cynical about"
01:48:34;01:48:38;"it, but it sounds like there's almost like another force from farther away that's like,"
01:48:38;01:48:41;"this is the vibe that's coming. This is the canary in the coal mine."
01:48:41;01:48:43;"- Empire Strikes Back. - There's going to be a more"
01:48:43;01:48:46;"like Eagles rootsy kind of... - It's that Netflix,"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"Eagles Netflix documentary. It got all the kids talking."
01:48:48;01:48:51;"- Part one or part two? - Both."
01:48:51;01:48:53;"- This sounds more part two. - Me and Mike have been watching that for"
01:48:53;01:48:58;"years. Looks like the kids caught on to it. Here's the only sin. I don't think there's anything wrong"
01:48:58;01:49:03;"with being an artist, particularly a younger artist, although she has been in the game since she was"
01:49:03;01:49:08;"five. So you think she'd have a little more insight, but there's nothing wrong with an artist"
01:49:08;01:49:13;"trying on different hats. If Miley said, on the last album I collaborated with, Mike Will made it."
01:49:13;01:49:17;"He's known for hip hop, but we came together and we made something special. On this album,"
01:49:17;01:49:19;"I chose to work with... - As opposed to..."
01:49:19;01:49:26;"- No, I'm saying if she said making that album with Mike and whoever else worked on it,"
01:49:26;01:49:31;"that was really special to me. On this album, because my dad's a country person,"
01:49:31;01:49:33;"I was raised in Nashville, I want to get back to my country roots."
01:49:33;01:49:36;"- Right. She could have said it without demonizing the whole thing."
01:49:36;01:49:40;"- Without demonizing the whole thing. - The other side, which is her"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"previous self. - Right."
01:49:42;01:49:44;"- And also... - Talk about self-destructive."
01:49:44;01:49:49;"- She was already an interloper kind of. So it's like you're on shaky"
01:49:49;01:49:54;"ground already and now you want to... - She proved her critics right. And also,"
01:49:54;01:49:58;"she could have said, first of all, why can't you bring Mike Will to Nashville?"
01:49:58;01:50:02;"Timbaland just produced a few songs on the Brad Paisley album."
01:50:02;01:50:05;"- Wow. - Accidental racist."
01:50:05;01:50:11;"- I don't... Well, that was a whole other story. Timbaland produced a few Brad Paisley songs."
01:50:11;01:50:17;"Actually, the history of blues and country, anybody who vaguely knows the history of music"
01:50:17;01:50:23;"knows they're interrelated. The influences of country are black and whatever. I'm just saying"
01:50:23;01:50:29;"this idea that's like, I had to leave hip hop entirely because all of it is bad and sexist."
01:50:29;01:50:32;"- Yeah. - It's like, you know people in hip hop."
01:50:32;01:50:36;"Does every song that Mike Will ever produced offend you?"
01:50:36;01:50:43;"- Right. And country's so good to women. I mean, I just don't... I also just... This makes me crazy"
01:50:43;01:50:48;"too because as a person who would like to think to see women treated better in general and certainly"
01:50:48;01:50:57;"in music in particular, it doesn't help that cause. That argument is, I would say, reactionary,"
01:50:57;01:51:02;"to say the least. It's just so obviously not substantive and a response and it's ego-driven."
01:51:02;01:51:08;"Suddenly it's like you wake up and discover that there's sexism in music and so you're"
01:51:08;01:51:14;"going to go ahead and announce that by attacking. It's just so... How many people have made this"
01:51:14;01:51:18;"argument over and over and over again and it's been just so little sophistication or understanding."
01:51:18;01:51:23;"- It's literally pinned black and white. It's not a sophisticated argument and she should know better."
01:51:23;01:51:27;"- And then she just sounds like what people already label women as, which is like..."
01:51:27;01:51:30;"- Oh, you dumb feminist. - Yeah. It's like, oh, that's feminism."
01:51:30;01:51:34;"Then that just tells everyone who hears that, that that's what a feminist sounds like."
01:51:34;01:51:36;"- Right. - Which is, you know..."
01:51:36;01:51:39;"- That's natural feminism. I don't know. - Whatever. Some genre of feminism."
01:51:39;01:51:42;"- And also the idea that it's like, I just want to chill out in Malibu."
01:51:42;01:51:46;"This is what Malibu sounds like? - Yeah, I want to forget it."
01:51:46;01:51:52;"Leave rap music behind and chill out in Malibu. - You know what album got finished in Malibu,"
01:51:52;01:51:54;"mixed? - A lot."
01:51:54;01:51:58;"- A lot and a lot of hip hop records. - I was going to say Yeezus as a particularly"
01:51:58;01:52:01;"harsh hip hop record. - I mean, Rick Rubin is out there."
01:52:01;01:52:05;"- Rick Rubin's out there. - Chilling in Malibu sounds like Yeezus."
01:52:06;01:52:09;"So... - So, yeah, it doesn't sound like this."
01:52:09;01:52:11;"- It's a damn shame, Miley. Whatever. - She'll get it back."
01:52:11;01:52:14;"- I don't know. Did she apologize? - Probably not."
01:52:14;01:52:20;"- She probably did. - Not to you. Thus, not at all."
01:52:20;01:52:24;"- It's two on the iTunes store, though. So someone's feeling it."
01:52:24;01:52:29;"- Well, because you got to assume that, like, there is a gigantic audience that's going to be"
01:52:29;01:52:33;"like, yeah, go for it, Miley. You're right. - Or maybe it's just a song they like hearing."
01:52:33;01:52:37;"I mean, how many people do you think are like actually going to hear that song aggressively"
01:52:37;01:52:39;"to support her cause? - They're not interested"
01:52:39;01:52:45;"in the medical commentary about song. - Yeah. Only we're like delving into that."
01:52:45;01:52:49;"- Yeah. - The number one song on the charts right now."
01:52:49;01:52:53;"Back at number one. Got knocked down a little bit, but it's back up. This might actually be"
01:52:53;01:52:58;"the song of the summer. Despacito. - Also Bieber."
01:52:58;01:53:02;"- Remix. - Big uber song."
01:53:02;01:53:05;"- This is a major uber song. - It's like in every uber ride."
01:53:05;01:53:10;"- Uber should have their own label. Like Starbucks. - Yes, actually."
01:53:10;01:53:12;"- That's a good idea. -"
01:53:32;01:53:34;"This is really big for Daddy Yankee. - Yeah."
01:53:34;01:53:40;"- Daddy Yankee hasn't been on American radio as much since Gasolina."
01:53:40;01:53:45;"- Yeah. And he's getting older. - Good for him."
01:53:45;01:54:00;"- Granddaddy Yankee now. - Yeah."
01:54:00;01:54:08;"- Okay. Which is more the song of the summer so far, Despacito or I'm the One?"
01:54:08;01:54:11;"- It's definitely Despacito. - I think I'm the One."
01:54:11;01:54:13;"- You know what, man? - I like Despacito more,"
01:54:13;01:54:17;"but I think I'm the One. - It's on the come up. It could be,"
01:54:17;01:54:20;"but I mean, right now this is... - Uber's going to be lit with I'm the One."
01:54:20;01:54:25;"- You know what? Justin Bieber's doing the classic rich guy move. Give a little money to Hillary."
01:54:25;01:54:31;"Give a little money to Trump. Whoever wins, I'm coming out on top and they owe me a favor."
01:54:31;01:54:34;"- True. - He's such a genius."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"Bieber for president. - I'm the one who's Trump."
01:54:36;01:54:38;"- I want that Daddy Yankee favor. - I guess Despacito's Trump"
01:54:38;01:54:41;"because it's winning. - I mean..."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"- That's not fair to anybody involved in that song."
01:54:43;01:54:46;"Congratulations to Justin Bieber. You spread your chips out on the table,"
01:54:46;01:54:51;"which sometimes can be seen as a weak move, but in this instance, you won double."
01:54:51;01:54:53;"- Yep. He hit on both. - Yeah, good job, Justin."
01:54:53;01:54:57;"- Justin Bieber has the songs of the summer. - So far."
01:54:57;01:55:01;"- Okay. - I'm hoping for a new horse in this race,"
01:55:01;01:55:04;"not to return to yet another brutalized... - I want a Bieber hat trick. I want one more."
01:55:04;01:55:10;"- That was the top five. Well, guys, this has been a very unique time crisis."
01:55:10;01:55:12;"Ashton Despot, thanks for joining me back in New York."
01:55:12;01:55:16;"- You're welcome. - Thank you, Ashton."
01:55:16;01:55:21;"- Wow. Everybody's just looking at their phones. - Nah, I was just looking around."
01:55:21;01:55:24;"- Okay. - They were thinking of the right thing to say"
01:55:24;01:55:28;"about your return to New York City. - You've been taking a lot of long pauses"
01:55:28;01:55:31;"today, so I thought you were maybe still in the train of thought."
01:55:31;01:55:37;"- I really appreciate you guys being part of the Time Crisis family. I know I haven't been here"
01:55:37;01:55:41;"much, but you're always in my heart. You'll always be part of the family of this show."
01:55:41;01:55:48;"Thank you, Lizzie Goodman, for coming through and teaching us about rock and roll New York City,"
01:55:48;01:55:55;"2001 to 2011. I mean, from what I've seen already, this book is great. I'm a little bit nervous."
01:55:55;01:56:02;"You know what? I just want to say one thing. I'm not nervous that spicy words may have come out"
01:56:02;01:56:07;"of my mouth, because I think I'm pretty good about that. A little more nervous that there"
01:56:07;01:56:12;"might be spicy words spoken about Vampire Weekend is the truth. - That's always what people are"
01:56:12;01:56:13;"nervous about. - From Rivers Cuomo."
01:56:13;01:56:15;"- Well, just because when I-- - I did speak to Riv-- no, I didn't."
01:56:15;01:56:19;"- Yeah, from Rivers Cuomo. Just because when I saw the strokes thing, it kind of reminded me,"
01:56:19;01:56:24;"it made me think about what it's like to be when a band first comes out, and you go through a lot"
01:56:24;01:56:28;"of emotions. One is excitement that people care about you, and literally, this is life. As soon"
01:56:28;01:56:34;"as you get that, you also see your first negative comment, or as soon as a cool older musician"
01:56:34;01:56:38;"that you respect says, ""Yo, I really like you guys,"" and you're like, ""Oh my God,"
01:56:38;01:56:42;"you believe that that person just said they liked us?"" Almost instantaneously, it's like,"
01:56:42;01:56:47;"""Oh yeah, and that other band said that you guys suck and that they're better than you and Bala."""
01:56:47;01:56:52;"So anyway, I might not be able to read it. - I love-- but your two concerns so far are,"
01:56:52;01:56:57;"will we be boring or will we be exciting in a way I don't like, basically?"
01:56:57;01:57:02;"- I just-- well, I just think, you know-- - I look forward to continuing this conversation"
01:57:02;01:57:04;"after you've seen the book. - It's probably gonna be somewhere"
01:57:04;01:57:09;"around Empire Strikes Back, though. 2006. - Vampire Strikes Back."
01:57:09;01:57:10;"- Oh, yeah. - Return of the--"
01:57:11;01:57:15;"well, anyway, anybody who cares about The Strokes, New York City,"
01:57:15;01:57:20;"who has 9/11 conspiracy theories, this is the book for you."
01:57:20;01:57:22;"- Absolutely. - Meet me in the bathroom."
01:57:22;01:57:24;"It's out on Tuesday. That's our show."
01:57:25;01:57:28;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:57:28;01:57:34;"Beats 1."
