00:00;00:09;"Five. Five dollar. Five dollar footlong. Today on Time Crisis we talk Subway,"
00:09;00:17;"their sandwiches, and their advertising. We also open up the fan mailbag and"
00:17;00:25;"count down the hits of 1983 and today. All this plus a very special TV theme"
00:25;00:33;"song from the 80s. This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:33;00:37;"Three beats. One. One."
01:11;01:25;"Time Crisis. Crunchy edition. I'm in the studio eating some flaming hot Fritos."
01:25;01:31;"Now every time we come in there's just different weird snacks. Jake's here too."
01:31;01:35;"What's up dude? By crunchy I thought you meant hippie. Oh no it's like it's funny"
01:35;01:38;"it's the opposite of hippie. Yeah exactly. What are you munching on over there? A"
01:38;01:45;"modello and some ruffles cheddar and sour cream. Are those good? Eh. A little heavy on the"
01:45;01:52;"sour cream. Yeah. Like the fake artificial chemical sour cream flavor. Mmm. I never"
01:52;01:58;"eat chips. Yeah so I eat chips every two weeks. Yeah me too. Actually was like"
01:58;02:02;"pretty healthy today until now. What'd you eat? I went to the gym in the morning"
02:02;02:08;"and then I had a coconut based protein shake. What else was in that? It's very"
02:08;02:14;"simple because. Did you make it? No. No. I can't believe. Absolutely not. Of course not."
02:14;02:18;"Sometimes I work out with the trainer. Yeah. Because I'm really trying to get"
02:18;02:23;"diesel. Taking it to the next level and I don't know nothing about nothing so I'd"
02:23;02:27;"always leave and be like so I should I have like protein after this? Yeah man you"
02:27;02:30;"gotta have protein. Then I would go to just like a random smoothie place and"
02:30;02:35;"like let me get the protein crunch whatever. With the muscle milk? I would"
02:35;02:38;"just get something off the menu that sounded good and then I was telling him"
02:38;02:43;"about it and he's like bro you do not need all that junk. He's like next time"
02:43;02:47;"you go to the place and you tell them you grab the expensive coconut water and"
02:47;02:52;"you say mix this with ice chocolate protein and a banana that's it. And then"
02:52;02:58;"I started doing it and it definitely felt lighter and also like the smoothie"
02:58;03:04;"place that I go to it's like all these just diesel dudes. It's a really I always"
03:04;03:07;"feel like a little embarrassed going in there like. Like there's a lot of powders?"
03:07;03:11;"A lot of powder yeah all sorts of weird powders. There's one time when when the"
03:11;03:16;"guy was like do you want to add some glucosamine or something he's like you"
03:16;03:20;"can add one scoop of something else too and I was like $1.29 dude and he was like"
03:20;03:25;"really it's free and I was like I'm good and he was just like you don't want some"
03:25;03:29;"glucosamine. I don't even remember what it was. So I don't know what I'm doing but I"
03:29;03:32;"will say this so then I started going in there and I ordered this kind of like"
03:32;03:36;"off-menu thing over and over again and eventually one of the dudes real diesel"
03:36;03:42;"dude mm-hmm they all wear a matching polos which I love. Real diesel dude matching"
03:42;03:45;"polos ring me up one day he's like I guess they started to recognize me"
03:45;03:48;"because I just come in I became a regular. Like what twice three times a"
03:48;03:51;"week? Yeah probably like average of twice a week and when the guy said to me like"
03:51;03:57;"you know man I've been drinking your smoothie lately and I was like what and"
03:57;04:01;"he's like you always come in here order that coconut one I tried it and it was"
04:01;04:05;"it was pretty good and I was like oh man I was like well you know first of all"
04:05;04:09;"thank you. I was like oh man this dude told me to try it that's I don't have"
04:09;04:11;"any idea what I'm doing I was like but you found it was good and he's like yeah"
04:11;04:15;"and I was like all right cool guess I'm on the right path. That needs to be on"
04:15;04:24;"the menu board Ezra's. I want like a signed headshot of you eight and a half"
04:24;04:31;"by eleven glossy black. Just full body shot? Yep. In a tank top? Maybe VW shows next year"
04:31;04:37;"tank top dude. I've thought about it because really well it gets so hot on"
04:37;04:41;"stage you know like the clothes that I like the most I like sweaters long pants"
04:41;04:46;"right but back in the day I used to try to go out on stage in a sweater even no"
04:46;04:49;"almost no matter where you're playing unless you're playing outside in the"
04:49;04:55;"winter you get hot so quickly yeah so then I don't know like you know ideally"
04:55;04:59;"if you could actually put together an outfit with like a tank top shorts"
04:59;05:29;"socks and socks? Uh. As I sit in my b-boy stance. With flip flops and socks and sweat pants. I'm finna enhance your brain. Check it out. Once upon a time not long ago when
the player from the point didn't have no flow. He hit me from my tennis shoes walking through the snow caught up in the slipping. But now I link it to the flow just like
Marvin. Cause I got the heat in my blimmin mama name and I never"
05:29;05:41;"bragging just to say nah even when I was a young lad I learned my lesson never talk to strangers in the trap and ask them questions. The Pope and his folks got us under the
scope but for unknown reasons cause we don't sell dope that you distribute we don't contribute to your clandestine activity my"
05:41;05:52;"soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow but so is Carl Everor. You went behind my back like Ludo when he cut up all the poor. Two things I hate lies and things that make my
blood pour. But we're constricted on my soul that they call the"
05:52;06:19;"wheels of steel. That show me how you feel. That's right the wheels of steel. That show me how you feel."
06:19;06:49;"It took your mama nine months to make it but it only took a 30 minutes to take it. Cut that croak clean up I did but I did so now safely. Don't want no A's no claps or no raise. We
take no shit like I'm stocked up Camo's. Gotta collect all that unlocked up my votes. Low blow hit me in the left ventricle. We won't be able to ride out to 2004. But not for
long cause we got a better sack to serve. Trying to take your other people for your rims. Hit your curve for your swerve and bust your forehead. Go ahead go ahead."
06:49;07:03;"Mo'head for me while you ride to the beat. Draw like tears like the beers. You know shout shout let it all out just for my peers and pupils who feel like it's time to unwind
like December 31st 1995."
07:03;07:17;"I gotta tell you I came in here wearing some socks and sandals and Jake immediately said stocks and socks. Yeah. What is the stocks referred to? Birkenstock. Oh. Okay.
That's like a real 90s look like. Stocks and stocks."
07:17;07:41;"I remember seeing this video of pavement playing a record in-store show in like 93 and Spiral Stairs is wearing stocks Birkenstocks and socks and shorts. And I was like
that was kind of my look when I was like 15. And I was like this is amazing. You have nice. Yeah I have these like hipster Japanese Tiva-esque things."
07:41;07:57;"Picture that with like kind of. Yeah Birkenstocks. Like leather. Right. That's weird. With like a white athletic sock. Yeah that that's that's a rough look. That's
tough. Although you could wear that with slides. You know like those like Adidas slides. Mm-mm."
07:57;08:15;"This is what people call those like the flip-flop with just like one large thing across the. Okay. Shower sandals. Didn't know that was the term. A lot of slides. Yeah. A
lot of people wear those with socks. So yeah you with stocks and socks shorts and a tank tank top. I would love that. To not have to worry about it."
08:15;08:35;"Protein shake on stage. Do some push-ups on stage. It's really hard to like. Just go full Andrew W.K. slash Glenn Danzig. Like if you got super yoked that'd be such a
weird. I don't think I can get yoked. No I don't think you can either. I don't think you have the genetic like it's just not who you are. It'd be tough. To get yoked. Like I
couldn't get yoked either."
08:35;09:05;"You know most people so many people who are yoked also take like human growth hormone or steroids. Can you imagine. That might be what I have to do. That would be crazy if
you did that. I might be stronger than I've ever been in my life. Dude. I don't know. I don't know if I'm dude. When we were at RALs like last week. Yeah. Two weeks ago. You
did like three or four pull ups. And you realize that's an incredibly low number to like. No no no. For a gym rat. But no no. Yeah. But I don't think. I was fully extending.
No dude. You were doing like balls to the wall pull ups. I can't do that."
09:05;09:35;"I could do one maybe. Pull ups are hard. A true pull up all the way down all the way up is hard. Not to be confused with a what chin ups. Oh wait what's the difference. When
you're. So pull up is when your palms are facing. When your palms are facing out. Yeah. That's truly hard. That's harder. Much harder. Okay so chin up. That's what you
were doing. I think we were doing. Maybe I was doing a chin up. Oh chin up is palms out. Pull up is palms out."
09:35;09:42;"Or maybe it's palms facing towards your face. I don't remember if I was doing the easy one or the hard one. I don't know. Fitness is important man."
09:42;09:44;"Everyone's feeling pretty."
09:44;09:48;"Gets hot third in July."
09:48;09:55;"Though the world's full of problems. They couldn't touch us even if they tried."
09:55;10:06;"From the park I hear rhythms. Molly's heart's on the books. Tonight there will be a party."
10:07;10:15;"On the corner at the end of the block. Didn't know you. We'll be jamming until the break of dawn."
10:15;10:23;"See nobody ever told you that you. We'll be jamming until the break of dawn."
10:23;10:26;"We'll be jamming and jamming and jamming and jamming."
10:33;10:46;"They want us to join the fighting. But our answer today is to let all our worries like a breeze through our fingers slip away."
10:46;10:57;"Peace has come through Zimbabwe. Third world's right on the one. Now's the time for celebration."
10:58;11:06;"Cause we only just begun. Didn't know you. We'll be jamming until the break of dawn."
11:06;11:13;"See nobody ever told you that you. We'll be jamming until the break of dawn."
11:13;11:21;"See nobody ever told you that you. We'll be jamming until the break of dawn."
11:22;11:29;"I know nobody told you that you. We'll be jamming until the break of dawn."
11:29;11:39;"So we've got a hell of a show today man. What's on tap? Seinfeld 2000 has been hooking us up with"
11:39;11:44;"the craziest guests. We got everybody from Kazzy David, Jonathan Wolfe. Jonathan Wolfe, composer"
11:44;11:52;"of the Seinfeld theme. He got the guys, the composer and the ad man behind the five dollar foot long jingle."
11:52;11:58;"I'm not familiar with that. You know that jingle? I don't know it. Catchy as hell. You familiar with"
11:58;12:04;"the restaurant chain Subway? Oh yeah. Okay so they- Found it in 1965 in New Haven, Connecticut."
12:04;12:08;"Oh really? It's from Connecticut? It's actually the largest chain in the world. It's there's more-"
12:08;12:14;"It beat McDonald's. Yeah because the overhead is way lower. Oh nice. You know to open a McDonald's"
12:14;12:26;"probably costs like a million dollars. Five. Five dollar foot long. Oh you remember this song? No. Five."
12:26;12:33;"Who is this reminding me of? Beach Boys. It reminds me- Yeah kind of a weird chord change. But it also has a"
12:33;12:39;"little like a British thing. Makes me think of like some late blur. Like coffee and tv era blur."
12:43;12:48;"Anyway we're gonna so we're gonna talk to those guys but we we need to get talk to Seinfeld first"
12:48;12:54;"because so you were really excited about um- Wait what? Yeah why? Because well Seinfeld- Oh boy. No no first of all"
12:54;12:59;"this is weeks ago Seinfeld was like really psyched about this. He's like I might have a connection to"
12:59;13:04;"the guys who wrote the five dollar foot long song. We're like that's amazing let's make it happen."
13:04;13:09;"And then just a couple days ago because he's a big Subway supporter. A couple days ago you you get"
13:09;13:14;"some weird news about the Subway chain and specifically their advertising. Yeah I don't- Do you"
13:14;13:18;"guys watch the show a Good Day LA? It's like the morning show. It's the Fox morning show. Nope. Okay"
13:18;13:23;"well in the mornings you know I'll watch a little morning tv you know it's you know my news or"
13:23;13:29;"whatever. Yeah. And the commercials come on and you know it's your average Subway commercial with the"
13:29;13:34;"whatever the hell the teriyaki chicken or whatever they're they're hawking. With Fogel right? No no he's"
13:34;13:40;"he's in prison. Jared Fogel. Okay yeah no he's he's done. When you say Subway and advertising it"
13:40;13:44;"it's like conjures the worst association possible. Yeah it's gonna take decades for them to shake."
13:44;13:49;"They've had a rough few years. Yeah Fogel's gonna be hard to shake. Anyway whatever I'm like not"
13:49;13:54;"you know I'm on my phone whatever it's like in the background and then in the last like 10 seconds"
13:54;14:01;"I'm hearing the Curb Your Enthusiasm music in the Subway ad and it's not they're not doing there's"
14:01;14:07;"no Larry David integration there's no reference to any there's no zooms it's not it's just straight"
14:07;14:13;"up it's just like so this is just a Subway ad and you just hear bum bum bum ba da da da da. Yeah"
14:13;14:18;"just kind of rolling. Can we listen to an example? Hey look it's everyone's favorite the six dollar"
14:18;14:23;"Subway close. Hey look it's everyone's favorite the six dollar sweet onion chicken teriyaki. I"
14:23;14:29;"was right about the teriyaki. Advertising. They're footlongs and they're six bucks each. Subway so"
14:29;14:33;"much sandwich. I mean that's that's messed up. That's brutal. Right well okay so first of all"
14:33;14:38;"that's really weird. Yeah I've known for a while that the Curb Your Enthusiasm music is library"
14:38;14:45;"music meaning that like right anybody who makes a tv show or movie they usually pay a fee to be"
14:45;14:50;"members of a music library because you know you're you're editing together a tv show every time you"
14:50;14:55;"want to get some music you don't necessarily want to like have a composer right do it from scratch"
14:55;15:01;"so as we know from talking to Jonathan Wolfe composer of the Seinfeld theme song uh Jonathan"
15:01;15:07;"Wolfe was out of the game he didn't want to score Curb. Larry was very upset by this and said you"
15:07;15:11;"know what I don't want you to score it anyway and he just ended up using library music so that means"
15:11;15:17;"that that music you couldn't just go throw the Seinfeld theme in something because you would need"
15:17;15:22;"um Steve Bannon's permission or whoever owns Seinfeld but that's library music so anybody can"
15:22;15:28;"use that so Seinfeld what Subway's doing it's legal man it's to the letter of the law it's"
15:28;15:34;"legal straight up it's disrespectful isn't it I mean once a piece of music gets so associated with"
15:34;15:40;"a certain thing and then of course and the Curb is coming back in October okay these guys right so"
15:40;15:47;"the timing is yeah it's sus it's very sus stealing the thunder anyway stealing valor"
15:49;15:55;"how do you feel about that Jake what do you think yeah I mean it's obviously a pathetic attempt to"
15:55;16:00;"you know leech on to Curb yeah if you don't know Curb and you hear the music it's sort of"
16:00;16:05;"innocuous music right you wouldn't even notice it but then for the percentage of the population that"
16:05;16:09;"knows Curb and loves Curb I don't know what they're hoping that maybe there's some sort of"
16:09;16:14;"subconscious reaction where you're sort of like you feel warmth towards Subway because you what"
16:14;16:19;"I think so I don't know what they're going for Subway's always portrayed themselves as like"
16:19;16:26;"being like slightly ironic really I think Subway's always like portrayed themselves having a sense of"
16:26;16:32;"humor but the Fogel campaign was like very sincere like this man lost 300 pounds but even that wasn't"
16:32;16:36;"it wasn't there something a little funny about the way they portrayed it I think that was very sincere"
16:36;16:42;"very aspirational I'm just saying like McDonald's will do commercials where it's like McDonald's"
16:43;16:49;"this is where the only place your family actually loves each other you know okay well so anyway"
16:49;16:53;"we're going to talk to these guys from Subway first and foremost I don't want to be like gotcha"
16:53;16:56;"by bringing up the Curb thing we're going to start out by showing them respect and talking about the"
16:56;17:00;"five dollar footlong jingle coming up after this we're going to get Jimmy Harnett and Jerry Cronin"
17:00;17:03;"the guys behind the five dollar footlong song on the phone"
17:03;17:05;"I seen your picture"
17:05;17:09;"Your name in lines above it"
17:12;17:14;"This is your big debut"
17:14;17:18;"It's like a dream come true"
17:18;17:22;"So won't you smile for the camera"
17:22;17:25;"I know they're gonna love it"
17:25;17:30;"I like your picture"
17:30;17:34;"I keep it with your letter"
17:36;17:38;"Done up in blueprint blue"
17:38;17:42;"It sure looks good on you"
17:42;17:47;"And when you smile for the camera"
17:47;17:50;"I know I love you better"
17:50;17:56;"Hey, it will come back to me"
17:56;18:00;"Hey, it will come back to me"
18:02;18:07;"Oh, the shutter buzz, you'll see it all"
18:07;18:12;"The music, it's your favorite foreign movie"
18:31;18:37;"Five, five dollar, five dollar footlong"
18:37;18:44;"Five, five dollar, five dollar footlong"
18:44;18:49;"It's good, good coming true"
18:49;18:53;"Subway, home of the famous five dollar footlong like our fresh toasted black forest ham with"
18:53;18:57;"cheese and our newest five dollar footlong the fresh delicious chicken pizzaiola five"
18:57;18:58;"dollar footlongs all day every day"
19:01;19:04;"Now let's go to the time crisis hotline"
19:04;19:09;"Hey Jimmy and Jerry"
19:09;19:09;"Hi"
19:09;19:10;"Hey there"
19:10;19:13;"Hey, how you doing fellas? Thanks for calling in a time crisis"
19:13;19:14;"How's it going?"
19:14;19:15;"No problem"
19:15;19:20;"Not bad, we've just been talking about the famous five dollar footlong jingle"
19:20;19:23;"So Jimmy, you're the one who actually composed this"
19:23;19:24;"That's right"
19:24;19:28;"Jerry, you're kind of like the ad man behind it, like how do you guys link up?"
19:28;19:32;"We always liked Jimmy and his company and Ray and all those guys and we had music we"
19:32;19:37;"often used them because they always did a good job, simple as that and they're nice people"
19:37;19:40;"Jerry, you're the guy at the advertising agency"
19:40;19:45;"so Subway comes to you and they just say we've got this five dollar footlong promotion"
19:45;19:46;"what do you got for us?"
19:46;19:51;"Yeah it was kind of, you know, Subway, they don't own any restaurants everything's"
19:51;19:57;"franchised out and some guy in Florida had an idea for selling all the subs at five bucks"
19:57;20:00;"and he coined the name five dollar footlong"
20:00;20:04;"so I mean that was, you know, including all the research and"
20:04;20:11;"the sales, it just caught on for some reason so we had to create a series of ads for it"
20:11;20:14;"it was, you know, it became a full billion dollar brand, just grew huge"
20:14;20:20;"but so we had to do some ads for it and so we had music, I mean the direction was pretty open"
20:20;20:25;"it was just because the name had such power, at least I thought it did"
20:25;20:30;"so we asked Jimmy and the guys to, you know, can you do something that's meant as a name"
20:30;20:33;"five dollar footlong as many times as possible"
20:33;20:36;"that was kind of the direction they had to go from"
20:36;20:41;"So Jimmy, do you remember when you got hit up by Jerry and the crew?"
20:41;20:46;"Did you get any other direction in terms of tone or vibe?"
20:46;20:50;"Jerry really said that we should sing it as many times as we can in 30 seconds before"
20:50;20:57;"the announcer comes in and other than that his directive was really just make it cool"
20:57;21:03;"I think one reason why people remember that jingle is because there's a haunting quality"
21:03;21:08;"about it because it has this, the chords are kind of unusual, it's kind of minor key and sad"
21:08;21:10;"Is that fair to say, guys?"
21:10;21:16;"Yeah, it's actually, it's actually, it's in C and I'm playing C major and then I go to A flat"
21:16;21:17;"which is"
21:17;21:18;"Out of the key"
21:18;21:23;"But they're both major chords but because of the way they interact it sounds kind of"
21:23;21:27;"a little bit metal-y, I guess, the way the melody goes down"
21:27;21:31;"But they're actually are, they're kind of major chords, they're just like"
21:31;21:33;"major chords you don't normally put together"
21:33;21:37;"Yeah, exactly, I think because they're going out of the key when you go to the A flat"
21:37;21:40;"to me it creates a kind of melancholic feeling"
21:40;21:40;"Yeah"
21:40;21:42;"They're like kinks or nirvana or something"
21:42;21:46;"Yeah, I mean, so did you have like, yeah, to me, we were talking about it, to us"
21:46;21:49;"it had a very British feel, like this bittersweet British sound"
21:49;21:51;"We were throwing out like the kinks, blur"
21:51;21:54;"Did you have any specific influences when you were working on it?"
21:54;21:57;"Not really, but I mean the Ray Davies thing for sure"
21:57;22:00;"but it wasn't like I was listening to the kinks that morning or anything but"
22:00;22:05;"I'm an acoustic guitar player and I just was working out the, I was trying to work out the"
22:05;22:11;"vocal harmonies on an acoustic guitar and it just seemed like just having mostly acoustic and"
22:11;22:15;"harmonies together would be kind of a cool sound"
22:15;22:18;"So Jerry, do you remember when you first heard Jimmy's demo?"
22:18;22:23;"Yeah, if I remember right, Jimmy, you had like five, six or eight of them even, didn't you?"
22:23;22:29;"Yeah, we made a whole bunch of them, we made, yeah, six or seven of them anyway and I think"
22:29;22:34;"there were a couple that we were, you guys were liking and we, you know, took a little"
22:34;22:35;"while to narrow it down"
22:35;22:40;"I think there was a couple we liked and we liked a lot more and everyone liked it to be honest"
22:41;22:45;"You know, the thing that happened after was all the people started, you know, on YouTube,"
22:45;22:49;"you know, creating their own versions of the music and re-recording it and,"
22:49;22:51;"you know, it just kind of took off that way too"
22:51;22:57;"It kind of went viral at a time, like this is very, this was 2008, right?"
22:57;23:02;"This is kind of like right at the cusp of when in advertising everybody started talking"
23:02;23:05;"about going viral and you guys just kind of happened to do it naturally with a catchy"
23:05;23:06;"piece of music"
23:06;23:09;"Yeah, I mean, it wasn't that we, you know, orchestrated it,"
23:09;23:13;"excuse me, not to be a pun, but, you know, just people started really liking the song"
23:13;23:18;"despite the fact that it was for a $5 sandwich, they just really liked it and doing their"
23:18;23:20;"own versions and trying it different ways"
23:20;23:22;"There was dance versions, there was all kinds"
23:22;23:25;"Did you guys find Death Metal Guy?"
23:25;23:26;"With the fingers back there?"
23:26;23:28;"No, is there a Death Metal version of it?"
23:28;23:32;"And he does like, he didn't even, I didn't listen to the song well enough to know the"
23:32;23:34;"right chords, he just kind of made up his own chords"
23:34;23:37;"If you can find Death Metal Guy, he was my favorite"
23:37;23:38;"I will definitely check that out"
23:38;23:43;"When you guys are working on this, you're putting all this work into the $5 Footlong"
23:43;23:48;"song, I mean, surely, somewhere in the back of your mind were you both thinking like,"
23:48;23:54;"we created this beautiful piece of music, but we know that we live in a society with"
23:54;23:58;"rampant inflation and these subs are not going to be $5 forever"
23:58;24:00;"Was that in the back of your mind?"
24:00;24:04;"No, it wasn't, because, I mean, you know, usually with a deal like that, you think it's"
24:04;24:08;"going to last, you know, three months or six months, it went for years, and it honestly"
24:08;24:14;"went to a $4 million brand, it's just, until they couldn't, you know, justify it because"
24:14;24:18;"of the rising cost of food, but, you know, I never thought it was going to last that"
24:18;24:22;"long, I don't think they did either, and it just kept going on, and, you know, they're"
24:22;24:27;"getting like, you know, 20% increases monthly, it just, it really took off"
24:27;24:30;"This was like a tremendous growth period for Subway?"
24:30;24:35;"Huge, huge growth period, it was, you know, they had a 20% monthly increase in the month"
24:35;24:39;"before, and the numbers, and it just, it took off, it became the brand"
24:39;24:42;"And wait, was, what was, was Jared around at that same period?"
24:42;24:45;"I don't remember, Jimmy, do you remember, he must have been in a couple scenes, wasn't"
24:45;24:46;"he?"
24:46;24:51;"I don't think he was in it, um, for the first couple of years, they might have, they"
24:51;24:56;"might have cut him in later on, but they seemed to like, it seemed mostly like you guys siloed"
24:56;25:01;"that work, like, Jared had his spots, and then the song stuff had its own spots, as"
25:01;25:02;"I remember"
25:02;25:09;"I feel like Jared was specifically marketing 6-inch subs, because his whole, like, aspirational"
25:09;25:12;"diet thing was based on, uh"
25:12;25:14;"Yeah, you can't eat a footlong if you're trying to lose weight"
25:14;25:14;"Yeah"
25:14;25:19;"No, I think, I think he was a footlong guy, well, that's like a terrible thing when you"
25:19;25:21;"talk about Jared being a footlong guy, but"
25:21;25:23;"I know, it's tough with Jared, yes"
25:24;25:25;"Did you ever meet Jared?"
25:25;25:29;"Yeah, we went out to dinner with him tons and tons of times"
25:29;25:30;"What was his vibe?"
25:30;25:31;"Nerdy"
25:31;25:32;"Yeah"
25:32;25:37;"And I hate to use the word, but kind of sweet and goofy, he was like a 420 pound kid from,"
25:37;25:41;"you know, we just never quite fit in, and all of a sudden took off because of some,"
25:41;25:43;"the sub thing"
25:43;25:44;"It's crazy"
25:44;25:44;"It's crazy"
25:44;25:46;"Back to the $5 footlongs, do you guys eat Subway?"
25:46;25:52;"Uh, yeah, no, I haven't eaten in a while, I'm trying to get away from bread, to be"
25:52;25:53;"honest"
25:53;25:54;"Fair enough, I think"
25:54;25:54;"Gluten free"
25:54;25:59;"Yeah, the whole world, that's definitely, see, we're curious about that, because Subway grew"
25:59;26:03;"like crazy since the period you're talking about, Jake was just telling me it's the number"
26:03;26:05;"one chain in the world, it beat McDonald's"
26:05;26:07;"It beats McDonald's a number of stores"
26:07;26:08;"Oh, a number of stores"
26:08;26:09;"Number of locations"
26:09;26:09;"Not revenue"
26:09;26:14;"No, not revenue, just number of stores, and you know, and McDonald's owns all this great"
26:14;26:17;"property, and a lot of Subways are in strip malls and so forth"
26:17;26:22;"Is Subway's tremendous growth period gonna slow down in this kind of anti-bread era?"
26:22;26:28;"I don't know where it is right now, but I know that after $5 footlong, that sales got"
26:28;26:29;"what they like to call flat, you know?"
26:29;26:30;"Right"
26:30;26:31;"It's hard to maintain that"
26:31;26:35;"Well, I just got a question for you guys, as people who are both parts of an iconic Subway"
26:35;26:39;"campaign, if Subway came to you and said, ""Guys, sales are flattening, we're worried"
26:39;26:43;"they're gonna start going backwards because people hate bread, now, what can we do?"""
26:43;26:45;"What's the first thing that comes to you guys' mind?"
26:45;26:50;"Some people use the show, but Subway and ask them to pull out as much as the bread inside"
26:51;26:52;"the Subway, you know?"
26:52;26:54;"Oh, like scoop it out?"
26:54;26:58;"Scoop it out, and you know, there's some chains that, you know, instead of using bread, they just"
26:58;27:03;"wrap it all in lettuce and put it in kind of a packaging that makes it easy to devour"
27:03;27:07;"Like that, that's pretty smart actually, the lettuce"
27:07;27:09;"$5 lettuce wrap"
27:09;27:12;"That doesn't exactly roll off the tongue"
27:12;27:16;"Well, thanks so much guys, that was really fascinating, and hopefully you guys can call"
27:16;27:20;"in again, I'd love to pick your brain about some of the other big campaigns, because we"
27:20;27:23;"know, Jerry, you've worked on a lot of big ones, Miller, Nike"
27:23;27:26;"I'd love to, Jimmy, good talking to you"
27:26;27:28;"Yeah, you too, Jerry, thanks for having us, guys"
27:28;27:31;"All right, thanks, Jimmy and Jerry, appreciate it, have a good one, guys"
27:50;27:51;"Are there vocals?"
27:51;27:54;"There's no vocals?"
27:54;27:56;"What the hell?"
27:56;28:00;"So supposedly that's the, that's $5 footlong song from the metal guy"
28:00;28:06;"Is that titled Subway $5 footlong? $5 footlong commercial death metal style"
28:06;28:07;"That guy could have tried a little harder"
28:23;28:26;"Do you feel like a chain store?"
28:26;28:29;"Practically floored"
28:29;28:34;"One of many zeros"
28:35;28:37;"Kicked around four"
28:37;28:41;"Your ears are full but you're empty"
28:41;28:45;"Holding out your heart"
28:45;28:49;"To people who never really"
28:49;28:53;"Care how you are"
28:53;28:59;"So give me coffee and TV"
28:59;29:03;"Please, don't leave"
29:04;29:08;"I've seen so much, I'm going blind"
29:08;29:10;"And I'm playing dead virtually"
29:10;29:14;"The social thing I do"
29:14;29:18;"Is hard enough for me"
29:18;29:23;"Take me away from this big bad world"
29:23;29:26;"And agree to marry me"
29:26;29:31;"So we can start over again"
29:34;29:35;"Man, I love Jimmy and Jerry"
29:35;29:37;"I don't know, I still don't know how I feel about Subway"
29:37;29:39;"But they seem like good guys"
29:39;29:45;"They were real lukewarm in their love of Subway's food"
29:45;29:47;"You guys still eat there?"
29:47;29:49;"They're keeping it real"
29:49;29:51;"Tough times for Subway"
29:51;29:54;"So you really have no memory of that song?"
29:54;29:54;"No"
29:55;30:01;"Five, five dollar, five dollar foot long"
30:01;30:03;"Interesting song"
30:03;30:05;"C major to E flat major"
30:05;30:07;"Very Kurt Cobain"
30:07;30:10;"Five"
30:10;30:13;"Yeah, that could totally be a Nirvana unplugged song"
30:13;30:17;"Five, five dollar foot long"
30:17;30:20;"Hello my friend"
30:20;30:25;"Here's five dollar foot long"
30:25;30:28;"[Laughter]"
30:28;30:30;"Chris Namastallik acoustic bass"
30:30;30:33;"Dave Grohl with the brushes"
30:33;30:34;"Turtleneck"
30:34;30:37;"Five"
30:37;30:40;"I can't really do a good Kurt impression"
30:40;30:43;"If like Kurt had lived and then Nirvana"
30:43;30:45;"Five dollar foot long"
30:45;30:47;"That's not a good Kurt impression"
30:47;30:51;"If Nirvana had made it to the era of like no one cares about"
30:51;30:53;"if your band uses their songs in an ad or not"
30:53;30:54;"Right"
30:54;30:56;"Because they were so like punk OG"
30:56;30:59;"But if they just like had made it to like 2014 or whatever"
30:59;31:02;"Just like come as you are and like a Lexus ad"
31:02;31:04;"That'd be so crazy"
31:04;31:05;"[Humming]"
31:05;31:08;"Also like by like kind of the rules of today"
31:08;31:12;"Not only would Nirvana probably like license their music for commercials"
31:12;31:14;"There probably would be a commercial that Nirvana's in"
31:14;31:17;"Where there's like a kind of meta ironic thing"
31:17;31:18;"Where there's like the owner of Subway is like"
31:18;31:20;"Now Kurt"
31:21;31:25;"I believe he used to call people like me a corporate whores in the early 90s"
31:25;31:27;"And he's like yeah well I grew up man"
31:27;31:30;"He's like glad to hear it Kurt"
31:30;31:32;"You know there'd be like some ironic joke about like"
31:32;31:34;"Five dollar foot long"
31:34;31:39;"I could see the Flaming Lips doing a good Subway ad"
31:39;31:40;"Yeah they could do that song"
31:40;31:42;"They're like old school indie but like"
31:42;31:43;"Five dollar"
31:43;31:45;"Like ironic"
31:45;31:45;"Yeah"
31:45;31:47;"I think Ween did a Pizza Hut ad"
31:47;31:48;"That was"
31:48;31:48;"Really?"
31:48;31:49;"That was aborted"
31:51;31:53;"And it was just like"
31:53;31:54;"Cheese inside the crust"
31:54;31:55;"Cheese"
31:55;31:56;"Cheese inside the"
31:56;31:58;"It was just like a weird like Frank Zappa kind of thing"
31:58;31:59;"They missed the era"
31:59;32:04;"It's like once Tim and Eric started like making ads and directing ads"
32:04;32:06;"Then it's suddenly it's like cool to be make weirdo ads"
32:06;32:07;"Right"
32:07;32:08;"Like the advertisers want them"
32:08;32:09;"The brands want them"
32:09;32:10;"People want to do them"
32:10;32:12;"Great way to make money"
32:12;32:13;"Oh god Ween"
32:13;32:14;"Miss Opportunity"
32:14;32:17;"Queen's truly the band that could just crush a corporate"
32:17;32:20;"No if they were 15 years younger they'd be killing it"
32:21;32:23;"Quiznos hit up me and Jake man"
32:23;32:24;"We'll write a song for you"
32:24;32:25;"Absolutely"
32:25;32:26;"You got to compete"
32:26;32:28;"Now's the time to pounce"
32:28;32:29;"Subway is weak"
32:29;32:30;"Quiznos can come big"
32:30;32:32;"Anyway Jake do you know this song?"
32:32;32:37;"How about that intro?"
32:37;32:38;"Does the intro do anything to you?"
32:38;32:41;"Sounds cool"
32:41;32:44;"How about now?"
32:44;32:46;"I don't know it"
32:46;32:46;"Really?"
32:46;33:10;"This is cool"
33:10;33:13;"Sounds like the roaches"
33:13;33:14;"You know the roaches?"
33:14;33:15;"Oh yeah the roaches are cool"
33:15;33:17;"Like they're a jersey band right?"
33:17;33:19;"Yeah three jersey gals"
33:19;33:23;"I've heard of Reading Rainbow I don't know what it is"
33:23;33:25;"Isn't this like dope synth part?"
33:25;33:26;"Totally"
33:26;33:30;"I happened to come across this recently because I grew up watching this show"
33:30;33:32;"This was a PBS show"
33:32;33:34;"Like Sesame Street style?"
33:34;33:37;"Well yeah like a different format but it was about reading and books"
33:37;33:41;"And was hosted by LeVar Burton who is also"
33:41;33:42;"Oh Star Trek"
33:42;33:43;"Yeah he's Geordie on Star Trek"
33:44;33:47;"And I was just like really struck by like how dope the synth part is"
33:47;33:52;"Like if you just like loop that that could be like something"
33:52;33:53;"Post Bob O'Reilly"
33:53;33:53;"Yeah"
33:53;33:57;"Are you gonna like put some trap drums behind this?"
33:57;34:05;"It reminds me of like early 80s new age records too"
34:05;34:05;"Yeah"
34:05;34:07;"And then it gets kind of like"
34:07;34:08;"Like Steve Hillage"
34:08;34:09;"Rainbow Dome music"
34:13;34:14;"Some good players on this"
34:14;34:14;"Yeah"
34:14;34:19;"Like so much cooler than it needs to be"
34:19;34:25;"Who's singing?"
34:25;34:27;"I don't know"
34:27;34:31;"What year is this?"
34:31;34:32;"Probably late 80s"
34:32;34:34;"83"
34:34;34:39;"So vibey"
34:39;34:41;"I don't know why"
34:41;34:43;"The reason I came across that thing"
34:43;34:44;"I was just reading about Reading Rainbow"
34:44;34:44;"I just thought about it"
34:44;34:47;"Because I heard somebody use the phrase"
34:47;34:48;"Don't take my word for it"
34:48;34:50;"And that's what the the host would always say"
34:50;34:53;"He'd always like tell you why you should read a book or something"
34:53;34:55;"Go but don't take my word for it"
34:55;34:56;"Or something like that"
34:56;35:00;"And there'd be it was this funny part where like kids would do book reviews"
35:00;35:01;"Oh wow"
35:01;35:03;"Like so a kid would be like"
35:03;35:07;"It's a little bit like a Vanessa Bayer character from SNL"
35:07;35:09;"Where it's like be like a five-year-old who'd be like"
35:09;35:12;"The Hungry Caterpillar by la la la la la"
35:12;35:14;"In this book a caterpillar blah blah blah"
35:14;35:15;"But that's not all"
35:15;35:17;"La la la la la la"
35:17;35:19;"Because them the caterpillar blah"
35:19;35:22;"I read the book but my brother wanted to hear it twice"
35:22;35:23;"La la la la la"
35:23;35:24;"Check it out"
35:24;35:27;"Every episode would have like two like book reviews from kids"
35:27;35:28;"Wow"
35:28;35:32;"This week my favorite book is Vanity Hacks and Ams by Dr. Seuss"
35:32;35:35;"You know just like that kind of awkward child acting"
35:35;35:36;"Yeah"
35:36;35:37;"Half hour episodes"
35:37;35:39;"Like what would the episode be?"
35:39;35:39;"I don't know"
35:39;35:40;"I don't remember"
35:40;35:43;"Like alphabet stuff like Sesame Street style like A"
35:43;35:45;"There were a lot of different um"
35:45;35:47;"Yeah he would talk about books"
35:47;35:50;"They would do some outside the studio stuff"
35:50;35:54;"I don't know why I don't know this because I watched Sesame Street"
35:54;35:55;"Yeah you know honestly"
35:55;35:57;"If it debuted in 83 it's like right in my wheelhouse"
35:57;36:00;"This is what the kids would sound like on the show"
36:00;36:04;"How would you like a board game at home whose characters come to life?"
36:04;36:06;"Picture this"
36:06;36:08;"Rhinoceros is stampeding your living room"
36:08;36:11;"An eight foot python wrapped around your fireplace"
36:11;36:15;"Why not try Jumanji?"
36:15;36:19;"The kids are literally making a pitch for a book"
36:19;36:21;"Why not try Jumanji?"
36:21;36:22;"It's like the"
36:22;36:24;"You know what Vanessa Bear"
36:24;36:25;"You know what I'm talking about"
36:25;36:27;"I think I do yeah"
36:27;36:31;"She was great she recently left SNL but I thought she was so brilliant"
36:31;36:35;"Like she would do these characters on Weekend Update that often would be like"
36:35;36:40;"Like one was like a child actress and one was like a bar mitzvah boy who and they both"
36:40;36:45;"She nailed that kind of like funny like kid kid trying to like"
36:45;36:47;"Like trying so hard"
36:47;36:49;"Dad it's because it really is such a specific rhythm"
36:49;36:52;"And da na na na hi my name is da na na"
36:52;36:53;"The three bears"
36:53;36:59;"This is a story that everyone knows but it's told in a funny new way"
36:59;37:02;"This is a story that everyone"
37:02;37:04;"It's like it's the rhythm of children's TV"
37:04;37:07;"Kids like 10,000 years ago talked that way"
37:07;37:10;"Well no this is something this is not even how kids talk"
37:10;37:11;"I'm hungry"
37:11;37:14;"No this is how this is kids trying to be professional"
37:14;37:17;"So they're kind of doing a very it's not like a normal kid"
37:17;37:19;"Like normal kids are all like shy like little kids"
37:19;37:24;"But there must have been kids that were like performers"
37:24;37:28;"I don't know maybe like like young princes and princesses"
37:28;37:31;"Just that cadence"
37:31;37:34;"Father my name is Dan"
37:34;37:36;"Anyway so that's the show Reading Rainbow"
37:36;37:37;"It was it was about reading"

41:02;41:04;"- I'm in."
41:04;41:05;"- First of all, I just wanna say"
41:05;41:09;"that Jake always forwards me the listener emails,"
41:09;41:12;"and even though we don't reference everyone on air--"
41:12;41:13;"- We read them all."
41:13;41:15;"- We really do appreciate them all."
41:15;41:17;"- Get like one or two a day."
41:17;41:18;"- That's pretty good."
41:18;41:19;"- Which is pretty solid."
41:19;41:20;"- That's solid."
41:20;41:21;"- Yeah."
41:21;41:22;"- The Time Crisis fan base."
41:22;41:23;"- Holding it down."
41:23;41:24;"- It's holding it down."
41:24;41:25;"- Time Crisis."
41:25;41:27;"- This is an interesting one."
41:27;41:30;"This one's from Adreja Chakrabarti."
41:30;41:32;"Forgive me if I'm mispronouncing your name."
41:32;41:35;"She writes, ""Dear Mr. Longstreth,"
41:35;41:37;"""I like the formality."

41:46;41:48;"""Also, this may provide some more youth input to the show,"
41:48;41:49;"""which seems to be something"

41:56;41:58;"""To be specific, I live in a suburb"

42:03;42:03;"That's interesting."
42:03;42:04;"Vancouver's a cool town."
42:04;42:05;"- Yeah."
42:05;42:06;"- I feel like being from a suburb of Vancouver"
42:06;42:07;"is probably pretty cool."
42:07;42:09;"- Shout out to Nick Kerkovich."
42:09;42:10;"- Oh, Vancouver guy."
42:10;42:11;"- Yep."
42:11;42:12;"- ""For the past few years,"
42:12;42:15;"""we've been hosting an EDM festival called Faded in the Park."""
42:15;42:16;"Great name."
42:16;42:17;"- What does that even mean?"
42:17;42:18;"- Well, you know, like faded,"
42:18;42:19;"kind of like when you get faded,"
42:19;42:20;"it means like you're drunk or high."
42:20;42:23;"- I know, but it's weird that there'd be a festival"
42:23;42:25;"that specifically condones--"
42:25;42:27;"- It's called like, also it's funny because like--"
42:27;42:28;"- Like, hammered."
42:28;42:30;"- EDM festivals are always getting in so much trouble."
42:30;42:31;"- Right."
42:31;42:35;"- For people dying on drugs or alcohol or whatever."
42:35;42:36;"So it's really funny just to basically call a festival"
42:36;42:38;"called like (beep) up in the park."
42:38;42:40;"- Yeah, hammered on the highway."
42:40;42:41;"- Yeah."
42:41;42:43;"(laughing)"
42:43;42:50;"- AC/DC and White Snake touring, hammered on the highway."
42:50;42:51;"- MDMA in the Bay."
42:51;42:53;"(laughing)"
42:53;42:56;"- That's a Bay Area festival."
42:56;42:57;"- Mali and Bali."
42:57;43:00;"(laughing)"
43:00;43:02;"- So there's an EDM festival called Faded in the Park"
43:02;43:04;"and it's found its home in our beloved city."
43:04;43:05;"Surrey has never been known for its music."
43:05;43:07;"If we want to play at an open mic,"
43:07;43:09;"we need to trek out two hours to cooler places"
43:09;43:11;"like downtown Vancouver and Gastown."
43:11;43:13;"- Well that's confusing."
43:13;43:14;"- Okay, so I guess maybe--"
43:14;43:16;"- 'Cause she, wait, she says that--"
43:16;43:17;"- Well she says it's a suburb,"
43:17;43:17;"but she's a distant suburb, I guess."
43:17;43:18;"- That's two hours."
43:18;43:20;"- Well yeah, that's what it could be."
43:20;43:21;"If that's the biggest city,"
43:21;43:22;"you might still call it a very distant suburb, I guess."
43:22;43:23;"- Jeez."
43:23;43:25;"- When commercial billboard charting artists"
43:25;43:27;"such as Drake, Justin Bieber, Rihanna come to our area,"
43:27;43:28;"they don't come to Surrey,"
43:28;43:30;"they come to Rogers Arena in Vancouver."
43:30;43:33;"- Rogers Arena, pretty classy name."
43:33;43:34;"- Yeah, Rogers is--"
43:34;43:37;"- Not exactly, you know, Office Depot Arena."
43:37;43:39;"- Yeah, no, no, but first of all,"
43:39;43:41;"Rogers is like a cell phone company, right?"
43:41;43:42;"- Oh really?"
43:42;43:44;"Okay, well that's one of the names that just works."
43:44;43:45;"- You know what, man?"
43:45;43:47;"You hear this old WASP-y name like Rogers,"
43:47;43:50;"and you're like, that sounds like a good man."
43:50;43:51;"That's a good man."
43:51;43:52;"- I'm not saying it's a good man."
43:52;43:55;"What I'm saying is it's not egregiously some brutal brand."
43:55;43:57;"Turns out it is."
43:57;43:58;"But some names."
43:58;44:00;"(laughing)"
44:00;44:03;"- Why, because an old WASP-y guy named Rogers"
44:03;44:05;"is so much classier than a young corporate chain"
44:05;44:07;"called Office Depot, man?"
44:07;44:10;"- What I'm saying is Rogers gives it room to breathe."
44:10;44:13;"- Get on the mic!"
44:13;44:14;"- I just wanna say--"
44:14;44:16;"- We're letting Saifah do that on the mic more often."
44:16;44:17;"- As a Canadian--"
44:17;44:17;"- I want you on the mic on the red."
44:17;44:19;"- I appreciate that, look."
44:19;44:21;"Just wanna put it out there as a Canadian"
44:21;44:25;"that Rogers is like the most awful company in Canada."
44:25;44:26;"- What is it?"
44:26;44:28;"- It's a telecommunications company."
44:28;44:33;"It's like Canada's AT&T, and it is like famously horrible."
44:33;44:36;"Like their customer service, it's like across the board."
44:36;44:37;"- Oh, wow."
44:37;44:38;"- It's so horrible that they're out there"
44:38;44:41;"supporting arenas for you guys to see good music in."
44:41;44:43;"- The thing about that arena is it used to be called"
44:43;44:45;"the Sky Dome, and it's associated with like--"
44:45;44:47;"- No, the Sky Dome's in Toronto."
44:47;44:48;"- Yeah, that's what we're talking about."
44:48;44:49;"- No, no, no, Vancouver."
44:49;44:50;"- Oh, they have one too."
44:50;44:52;"- No, first of all, that's just hilarious."
44:52;44:54;"Rogers has so many tentacles all over"
44:54;44:56;"the fine country of Canada that it's like"
44:56;44:58;"Rogers Arena here, Rogers Arena there."
44:58;44:59;"- Oh, I didn't even know that."
44:59;45:00;"Oh, (beep) Rogers."
45:00;45:01;"- That's even worse."
45:01;45:02;"- Oh my gosh."
45:02;45:03;"- I hate all Rogers."
45:03;45:05;"- Okay, so I'm thinking about the Toronto,"
45:05;45:06;"I forgot about the Vancouver thing."
45:06;45:09;"- Also, can I point out, Seinfeld 2000,"
45:09;45:11;"really dropping some biographical details here."
45:11;45:12;"I think people would be surprised"
45:12;45:13;"to learn that you're Canadian."
45:13;45:14;"- Wait a second."
45:14;45:15;"- Hi, you know--"
45:15;45:17;"- Was the Sky Dome where the Blue Jays played?"
45:17;45:18;"- Yeah, it is."
45:18;45:20;"- The Sky Dome, is it now called Rogers?"
45:20;45:21;"- It's called Rogers Center as of like--"
45:21;45:22;"- It's no longer called the Sky Dome?"
45:22;45:25;"- It hasn't, no, since like '04 or '05 or something."
45:25;45:27;"- Okay, so Seinfeld, you're born and raised in Toronto."
45:27;45:28;"- Not exactly."
45:28;45:30;"- Okay, whatever, you're born and raised in--"
45:30;45:31;"- Eastern Canada."
45:31;45:32;"- Eastern Canada."
45:33;45:35;"And so for you, there's this iconic place, the Sky Dome,"
45:35;45:37;"you're a little kid and you're just like,"
45:37;45:38;"""Mommy, Daddy, one day I wanna go see"
45:38;45:40;"""the Blue Jays play at the Sky Dome."""
45:40;45:41;"And then you grow--"
45:41;45:42;"- Watch Kelly Gruber."
45:42;45:44;"- And then you grow and every day,"
45:44;45:45;"you look at your (beep) Rogers phone,"
45:45;45:47;"you're like, ""This service sucks."""
45:47;45:49;"The customer service is horrible."
45:49;45:50;"- Why did they bill me twice this month?"
45:50;45:52;"- They're billing you twice,"
45:52;45:54;"they're probably not giving back enough taxes"
45:54;45:56;"to give you free healthcare and things like that."
45:56;45:59;"And now they throw their name on your beloved Sky Dome."
45:59;46:01;"Okay, I'm with you, that sucks."
46:01;46:02;"- It's funny that a cell phone company's name"
46:02;46:05;"is just a name, Rogers."
46:05;46:07;"We have T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon."
46:07;46:08;"- Yes, they've got your--"
46:08;46:11;"- Imagine if we just had like, Bob's."
46:11;46:12;"Bob's Cellphones."
46:12;46:14;"- It's Ted Rogers, the guy."
46:14;46:15;"- You know, Ted Rogers."
46:15;46:18;"It's even funnier though, okay, Rogers is his last name,"
46:18;46:21;"it's even funnier if you picture it being R-O-T-E-R,"
46:21;46:22;"apostrophe S."
46:22;46:24;"Rogers Telecom."
46:24;46:28;"Rogers speaking."

47:25;47:26;"I like this."
47:26;47:28;"So she lives in Surrey,"
47:28;47:30;"two hours outside of the nearest city"
47:30;47:31;"and your city's Vancouver."
47:31;47:34;"So she's a musician, she wants to go to open mic night."
47:34;47:37;"She's jumping in the car for two hours"
47:37;47:40;"heading into the city."
47:40;47:43;"And then so she wants to see Drake, Bieber, Rihanna."
47:43;47:44;"She and her friends are driving"
47:44;47:47;"into Rogers Arena in Vancouver."
47:47;47:49;"So that's pretty funny to live two hours outside of a city"
47:49;47:52;"and be into music and then suddenly,"
47:52;47:54;"just like out of nowhere, they're like,"
47:54;47:57;"""EDM festival Faded in the Park coming to Surrey."""
47:57;47:58;"That's pretty wild."
47:58;48:03;"So anyway, I go on with her email."
48:03;48:05;"Faded, as it is affectionately called,"
48:05;48:07;"takes place in a park across the Skytrain Station"
48:07;48:08;"where all the druggies hang out"
48:08;48:10;"and has been a running joke,"
48:10;48:13;"mainly because of its underwhelming/tasteless lineups"
48:13;48:14;"and frat-like atmosphere"
48:14;48:16;"in a Costco-loving soccer mom suburb like Surrey."
48:16;48:18;"However, the tables have now turned."
48:18;48:23;"This year, the Chainsmokers are headlining the festival."
48:23;48:26;"It's understandable that the tasteful palette of '70s rock,"
48:26;48:27;"thank you, Jake,"
48:27;48:29;"may not resonate with a lot of today's youth,"
48:29;48:31;"but Faded is not a festival about bringing people together"
48:31;48:33;"for their love of any type of music, for that matter."
48:33;48:36;"For example, I remember taking the Skytrain last year"
48:36;48:37;"and overhearing attendees talk"
48:37;48:40;"about how they have no idea who Zedd and Jack U are,"
48:40;48:41;"the headliners."
48:41;48:42;"The Chainsmokers,"
48:42;48:45;"arguably the most popular mainstream artists of 2017,"
48:45;48:47;"are headlining a music festival five minutes from my house"
48:47;48:50;"where attendees care about anything but music."
48:50;48:51;"What does this say about the current state"
48:51;48:53;"of mainstream pop music and its consumers?"
48:53;48:55;"Has it always been this way?"
48:55;48:56;"I.e., the most popular artists of the year"
48:56;48:57;"playing a music festival,"
48:57;49:01;"which has never, ever, ever been about music, like, at all."
49:01;49:02;"I'm just putting this out there"
49:02;49:03;"and I don't know if you guys will ever read this,"
49:03;49:05;"but it'd be cool to know that you guys have."
49:05;49:08;"Love from a fellow Time Crisis fan."
49:08;49:10;"I just, like, love the image of just, like,"
49:10;49:14;"being in a small town, two hours outside of Vancouver,"
49:14;49:17;"and the Chainsmokers are gonna be playing, like,"
49:17;49:17;"five minutes from your house."
49:17;49:19;"That just sounds like an '80s movie,"
49:19;49:21;"aside from the Chainsmokers."
49:21;49:25;"Just like, man, so boring living in the suburb."
49:25;49:27;"And then just, like, suddenly, it's like,"
49:27;49:29;"the town wins, like, a contest and they're like,"
49:29;49:30;"Van Halen's playing."
49:30;49:33;"Van Halen's playing five minutes from my house."
49:33;49:35;"Okay, so I guess she's saying--"
49:35;49:36;"People are there to party."
49:36;49:37;"People are there to party."
49:37;49:38;"They don't care about the Chainsmokers."
49:38;49:39;"Which has been, like, a running question we've had."
49:39;49:41;"Yeah, like, other real heads."
49:41;49:44;"As much as we respect the Chainsmokers' artistry,"
49:44;49:46;"and they're huge, sometimes it's weird."
49:46;49:48;"Sometimes these really, really big artists"
49:48;49:51;"just don't have dedicated fans."
49:51;49:53;"Like, if they played, like, The Wiltern,"
49:53;49:56;"which is capacity, like, 2,500 or something,"
49:56;49:59;"they'd sell it out, but, like, what--"
49:59;50:01;"Could they sell the Staples Center?"
50:01;50:03;"You have to assume."
50:03;50:06;"Imagine the Chainsmokers playing, like, The Troubadour."
50:06;50:08;"Like, what would that vibe be?"
50:08;50:09;"It wouldn't make any sense for them to play The Troubadour."
50:09;50:11;"It would make no sense."
50:11;50:12;"I mean, you know, whatever."
50:12;50:14;"Chainsmokers, headlining FYF."
50:14;50:16;"They played SNL, you know,"
50:16;50:18;"they'd have some backing tracks and live people,"
50:18;50:19;"and the guy would sing."
50:19;50:20;"It'd be fun."
50:20;50:21;"Yeah."
50:26;50:49;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
50:49;50:52;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beats."
50:53;50:54;"One."
50:54;50:56;"So, Jake, obviously, this is not the same thing"
50:56;50:59;"as the Gigi's situation, 'cause you live in LA,"
50:59;51:02;"but how do you feel knowing that, over this weekend,"
51:02;51:03;"the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac"
51:03;51:05;"played five minutes from your house?"
51:05;51:08;"I feel surprisingly little about that."
51:08;51:09;"Here's my vibe."
51:09;51:11;"I don't like big shows."
51:11;51:11;"Yeah."
51:11;51:14;"The Roger Waters show was great."
51:14;51:15;"'Cause it was a big spectacle?"
51:15;51:16;"It was fun."
51:16;51:16;"Yeah."
51:16;51:18;"The visuals were on point."
51:18;51:20;"Just getting into that Roger Waters show"
51:20;51:21;"was such a nightmare."
51:21;51:25;"If I was just like paying like 200 bucks to see the Eagles,"
51:25;51:27;"that's just not a good time."
51:27;51:29;"That does not sound fun."
51:29;51:31;"I know that some of the tickets for this Eagles,"
51:31;51:33;"and also like Earth, Wind, and Fire and the Doobies"
51:33;51:35;"were playing that night."
51:35;51:36;"That sounds awful."
51:36;51:40;"I mean, I really like some Eagles songs,"
51:40;51:42;"and I love Fleetwood Mac."
51:42;51:44;"You wouldn't shell out $1,800?"
51:44;51:46;"(laughs)"
51:46;51:47;"For the weekend?"
51:47;51:49;"No."
51:49;51:50;"I think, legitimately, I heard that--"
51:50;51:51;"That is so cheap."
51:51;51:53;"I don't know if this is the average ticket price,"
51:53;51:56;"but I definitely heard that like certain tickets"
51:56;51:58;"were $950 for each night."
51:58;51:59;"That's crazy."
51:59;52:02;"I mean, most times when I see music,"
52:02;52:04;"especially in a big venue,"
52:04;52:05;"as soon as it starts, I'm like,"
52:05;52:07;"when is this gonna end?"
52:07;52:08;"Yeah."
52:08;52:09;"It's like an endurance test."
52:09;52:10;"I don't know."
52:10;52:15;"I just, if I'm like 180 yards away,"
52:15;52:18;"and I'm just kind of looking at like the big Jumbotron,"
52:18;52:19;"it sucks."
52:19;52:22;"Yeah, that's why you just gotta have a beer,"
52:22;52:23;"bring a vape pen or something."
52:23;52:26;"And I'm not like, you know,"
52:26;52:28;"I don't worship Don Henley or,"
52:28;52:30;"I guess, Glenn Fyfe's dead."
52:30;52:31;"Glenn will not be there."
52:31;52:32;"Glenn's son."
52:32;52:33;"It's just like, what is,"
52:33;52:35;"it just seems so depressing."
52:35;52:36;"Yeah."
52:36;52:39;"Like Glenn being dead and the Eagles carrying on."
52:39;52:40;"It's very Eagles."
52:40;52:42;"It's very--"
52:42;52:43;"On brand."
52:43;52:43;"Yeah."
52:43;52:46;"The brand must persevere, man."
52:46;52:48;"That's right."
52:48;52:49;"It's depressing."

54:59;55:04;"- I got a question for you 'cause like I always felt,"
55:04;55:06;"you know, I told you as I'm making the record"
55:06;55:08;"increasingly I'm thinking about like shows."
55:08;55:09;"- Yeah."
55:09;55:11;"- Probably doing some shows next year."
55:11;55:13;"And back in the day I always felt like"
55:13;55:15;"I'd been to so many boring shows."
55:15;55:15;"- Yeah."
55:15;55:18;"- That I was like I'd like to keep our sets concise."
55:18;55:19;"- Yeah."
55:19;55:20;"- But at the same time now I'm being like,"
55:20;55:22;"well pretty soon we're gonna have"
55:22;55:24;"four albums worth of material."
55:24;55:26;"Can play longer shows."
55:26;55:26;"- Yeah."
55:26;55:28;"- And it's kinda like,"
55:28;55:29;"okay I know there's people in the crowd"
55:29;55:31;"who come to the show and they appreciate that"
55:31;55:35;"it's short and quick, not too many slow songs in a row,"
55:35;55:38;"not too much noodling, and you in and out,"
55:38;55:39;"they like that."
55:39;55:41;"But do you think most people though"
55:41;55:43;"who if they're rolling to the show,"
55:43;55:45;"they bought a ticket,"
55:45;55:47;"they want it to be as long as possible?"
55:47;55:48;"What do you think?"
55:48;55:49;"- Okay."
55:49;55:50;"Well, this is different."
55:50;55:51;"- 'Cause certain, you know,"
55:51;55:52;"there's like Bruce Springsteen's of the world"
55:52;55:54;"who are like, they're fans,"
55:54;55:56;"if he doesn't play three hours they're disappointed."
55:56;55:57;"- Right."
55:57;55:58;"- And I love Bruce but I've always been like"
55:58;55:59;"a little nervous about like,"
55:59;56:01;"I've never been to a three and a half hour show."
56:01;56:02;"I don't know how my body would react."
56:02;56:05;"- Yeah, I'd want Bruce to play for three hours."
56:05;56:06;"You know what it is?"
56:06;56:09;"It's like Bruce somehow still seems inspired"
56:09;56:13;"and like pumped and like ready to bring it for three."
56:13;56:13;"- Yeah."
56:13;56:15;"- Do you have the sense that the eagles"
56:15;56:17;"are in that same headspace?"
56:17;56:19;"- Perhaps not."
56:19;56:20;"- You're still--"
56:20;56:23;"- Wouldn't that be like (beep) up if they're just like,"
56:23;56:25;"you know man, we didn't think we'd be doing many shows"
56:25;56:26;"but after Glenn died,"
56:26;56:29;"we just felt so fired up and energized."
56:29;56:31;"- Playing like four hour shows."
56:31;56:33;"- Yeah."
56:33;56:34;"Oh man."
56:34;56:35;"But it's his son filling in for him?"
56:35;56:36;"- Yeah."
56:36;56:37;"- Okay."
56:37;56:38;"- I guess--"
56:38;56:38;"- They're keeping in the family."
56:38;56:39;"- Okay, but in your case I would say--"
56:39;56:40;"- Do you wanna see a three hour,"
56:40;56:42;"15 minute Vampire Weekend show?"
56:42;56:47;"- No, but I wanna see two hours and 10 minutes."
56:47;56:47;"- Okay."
56:47;56:49;"- 'Cause I feel like I've seen you many times"
56:49;56:51;"and I also feel like it's good to leave the audience"
56:51;56:54;"wanting more when you're a younger band."
56:54;56:56;"But now you're really hitting your stride"
56:56;56:58;"as like a mature artist."
56:58;56:59;"- Grown man."
56:59;57:01;"- And I wanna see like a confident show"
57:01;57:04;"where you like kinda like kick it out"
57:04;57:06;"and let the edges be a little shaggy."
57:06;57:07;"- Okay."
57:07;57:09;"- Where it's not so orchestrated"
57:09;57:11;"and you just like let it be a little free"
57:11;57:15;"and like play some unpredictable tracks, jam it out."
57:15;57:19;"I'd like to see two 10 pushing two 20."
57:19;57:20;"- Okay."
57:20;57:21;"- That'd be epic."
57:21;57:23;"- Two hours and 10 minutes, not 210 minutes."
57:23;57:25;"- Yeah, yeah, two hours."
57:25;57:28;"Yeah, two hours 10 minutes would be, that would be awesome."
57:28;57:30;"- We've never played a show that long."
57:30;57:33;"I think the longest we ever played is maybe like an hour 40."
57:33;57:37;"So that's not crazy, throw another 30 on top of an hour 40."
57:37;57:39;"- Yeah, just pacing it right."
57:39;57:40;"- Yeah."
57:40;57:42;"- I also feel like I gotta loosen up too"
57:42;57:46;"'cause like I think sometimes if the crowd's not like"
57:46;57:48;"going crazy throughout the show, you get insecure."
57:48;57:50;"But then I think about when I go to see shows,"
57:50;57:51;"even when I see artists I love."
57:51;57:52;"- Yeah."
57:52;57:54;"- Even when I see artists who put on like a crazy show,"
57:54;57:55;"like one of the last arena shows I saw"
57:55;57:57;"before Roger Waters was Kanye."
57:57;57:58;"- Yeah."
57:58;57:59;"- Where he's like flying around."
57:59;58:00;"- I saw that show."
58:00;58:01;"- That show's wild, right?"
58:01;58:01;"- Yeah."
58:01;58:04;"- I love Kanye, I literally know every Kanye song."
58:04;58:07;"And even then, you know, there's like about halfway through,"
58:07;58:10;"I was like, now's a good time to use the restroom."
58:10;58:11;"- Right."
58:11;58:12;"- Check out the concessions."
58:12;58:14;"And it's not because I wanted to leave or anything,"
58:14;58:17;"it's just like, it's all good, you know?"
58:17;58:18;"And sometimes the band plays"
58:18;58:19;"and they start playing some slow songs"
58:19;58:20;"and you don't wanna hear them."
58:20;58:22;"Or sometimes they play something that you just don't wanna."
58:22;58:24;"- Sometimes the slow songs are the ones"
58:24;58:26;"where you're just like getting in though."
58:26;58:27;"'Cause like listening to Dead Bootlegs,"
58:27;58:28;"which I know you've been doing."
58:28;58:29;"- Yeah, that's true."
58:29;58:32;"- The Dead are incredible because they will like"
58:32;58:36;"so confidently play the slowest, quietest song."
58:36;58:38;"- A 19 minute morning do."
58:38;58:41;"- Yeah, or like a nine minute like Ro-Jimmy."
58:41;58:42;"- Right."
58:42;58:44;"- And there's like barely anything happening."
58:44;58:45;"- No, I agree with you."
58:45;58:47;"- And maybe half the arena's like getting nachos"
58:47;58:48;"and taking (beep)"
58:48;58:50;"but it's like all good."
58:50;58:52;"- I know what you mean."
58:52;58:53;"- It's so confident."
58:53;58:54;"- When you listen back to Grateful Dead show"
58:54;58:56;"and you hear like the high energy ones,"
58:56;58:58;"like the 50s rock covers."
58:58;59:00;"- Yeah, or like Scarlet or something."
59:00;59:03;"- Well, Scarlet, even Scarlet's mid-tempo, truthfully."
59:03;59:04;"But you know, just like."
59:04;59:05;"- Promised Land."
59:05;59:08;"- Yeah, Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly covers."
59:08;59:10;"I'm sure like to some people that was like,"
59:10;59:11;"wow, they were really cooking."
59:11;59:12;"That's when they were rocking."
59:12;59:14;"But you listen back, it's like those songs are pretty lame"
59:14;59:17;"compared to the slow, beautiful, vibey ones."
59:17;59:18;"- Yeah."
59:18;59:19;"- But you know, sometimes on stage"
59:19;59:23;"when you play the slow, prettier ones,"
59:23;59:25;"you're not getting that immediate energy off the crowd."
59:25;59:28;"- But dude, that's where you dive into your confidence."
59:28;59:29;"- I remember."
59:29;59:30;"- (beep) the crowd, man."
59:30;59:31;"You're there, you're like doing your thing."
59:31;59:33;"- I know, and maybe that's that grown up stuff"
59:33;59:36;"that you're talking about is becoming more confident."
59:36;59:36;"I remember."
59:36;59:38;"- I need to be a tour consultant."
59:38;59:38;"- Oh yeah."
59:38;59:39;"- It sounds like, basically."
59:39;59:40;"- We're bringing you on the road, man."
59:40;59:41;"- Okay, I need to be."
59:41;59:44;"- The spiritual advisor on the road."
59:44;59:45;"- I'll be writing the set lists."
59:45;59:46;"- That's right."
59:46;59:48;"Choosing which ones we gotta jam out."
59:48;59:50;"- Yeah, for sure."
59:50;59:53;"- I wanna get you up to 210 by March 5th."
59:53;59:55;"- Let it breathe, just let it breathe."
59:55;59:59;"- We're gonna, at Cleveland, I need you at an hour 45."
59:59;01:00:02;"But by Madison, Wisconsin, man, we need that 210 show."

01:01:03;01:01:05;"- Yeah, I've heard like eight or nine songs"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"off the new album."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"- So you know it exists."

01:01:16;01:01:17;"- Which on previous albums,"
01:01:17;01:01:18;"sometimes we'd be working on a song"
01:01:18;01:01:21;"and I'd be like, oh my God, how are we gonna do this live?"
01:01:21;01:01:25;"- The earlier stuff, it's like, what could you jam out?"
01:01:25;01:01:26;"Kids Still Stand a Chance you could do."
01:01:26;01:01:28;"- You could jam out, yeah, for sure."
01:01:28;01:01:29;"- You could go dead style on that."
01:01:29;01:01:32;"- You know what else, like, Eight Minute Cape Cod."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"- Wait, really?"
01:01:33;01:01:34;"Wow."
01:01:34;01:01:36;"- Yeah, (hums)"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"Yeah, Bae just hold down on the bass,"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"and just do like a little (hums)"
01:01:40;01:01:46;"- I'm in, dude."
01:01:46;01:01:48;"(hums)"
01:01:48;01:01:51;"Eight Minute Cape Cod."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"- Eight Minute Cape Cod."
01:01:53;01:01:54;"(laughs)"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"- Vampire Cling full jam band."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"(laughs)"
01:01:58;01:01:59;"That'd be tight."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"- Two hour, 10 show, Eight Minute Cape Cod."
01:02:01;01:02:02;"- Strong."
01:02:02;01:02:05;"- Yeah, this is gonna require a lot of discussion"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"and a lot of planning, but it's coming."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"- No set lists."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"- I'm scared about the no set list thing."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"I really do want it to loosen up a bit."
01:02:12;01:02:15;"- That would be, yeah, no, you have to work up to that."
01:02:15;01:02:17;"- Yeah, there could be rough set list."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"For me, rather than having no set list,"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"I would like maybe design a flow chart set list."
01:02:21;01:02:24;"- Yeah, would you ever make decisions on the fly"
01:02:24;01:02:25;"playing a show?"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"Like, there's a set list,"
01:02:27;01:02:28;"and then depending on the vibe of the room,"
01:02:28;01:02:31;"you'd be like, actually, let's jump to that song"
01:02:31;01:02:32;"and come back to the other one."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"Or would it always just be like, let's play the set list?"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"- That's never really happened."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"Occasionally, if I felt like my voice was giving out,"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"I might cut one or something, or who knows."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"But I think also getting older, too,"
01:02:43;01:02:46;"it's like, in your first few albums,"
01:02:46;01:02:48;"you're so nervous all the time."
01:02:48;01:02:50;"And I'm not saying that I don't still have anxiety"
01:02:50;01:02:53;"about a lot of stuff regarding music and career,"
01:02:53;01:02:56;"but in some ways, the show,"
01:02:56;01:03:00;"it's like, we went out, we toured three albums."
01:03:00;01:03:01;"Here's one thing I'll say,"
01:03:01;01:03:04;"is that I do feel more confident about taking some risks"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"and making the show longer and taking some chances."
01:03:06;01:03:09;"'Cause if worst case scenario is like,"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"we just suck one night,"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"I'm at a point in my life where I could be like,"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"meh, that's all right."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"If we take a few chances and it falls flat--"
01:03:17;01:03:20;"- That's the thing, if it sucks 'cause you're taking chances,"
01:03:20;01:03:21;"that's cool."
01:03:21;01:03:24;"- It's better than sucking just 'cause you're a robot."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"- Exactly, I think if the fans are gonna,"
01:03:26;01:03:28;"I think that's why people love ""The Dead"" partially,"
01:03:28;01:03:31;"'cause ""The Dead"" played so many bad shows."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"- Right, infamously, yeah."
01:03:32;01:03:36;"- And they did so many terrible covers."
01:03:36;01:03:39;"But it was because they were trying stuff out,"
01:03:39;01:03:42;"and the fans felt like they were on a journey with the band."
01:03:42;01:03:45;"So if they fell flat 'cause they were trying something new,"
01:03:45;01:03:48;"then it was like, well, we're along for the ride."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"But if you're falling flat 'cause you're a robot,"
01:03:50;01:03:52;"like you said, then it's a bummer."
01:03:52;01:03:54;"It's like, what are you even doing?"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"So if you're trying stuff and you fall flat,"
01:03:56;01:04:00;"like the Madison show, you play for two hours, 40 minutes."
01:04:00;01:04:01;"And then it's just like--"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"- You were just bored."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"- And like, yeah, whatever."
01:04:05;01:04:06;"- Honestly, that'd be hilarious."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"If we ever do play Madison Square Garden."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"- Oh, I was thinking Madison, Wisconsin."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"- Oh, that's, oh, it's--"
01:04:12;01:04:13;"- Honestly--"
01:04:13;01:04:14;"- MSG, you dial it in."
01:04:14;01:04:16;"- It's way funnier that we just fall flat,"
01:04:16;01:04:19;"a hometown show, iconic Madison Square Garden,"
01:04:19;01:04:22;"and just be like, yeah, they really sucked,"
01:04:22;01:04:25;"man, okay, no, Madison, Wisconsin,"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"kind of a kinder vibe town."
01:04:27;01:04:30;"- You open with an eight minute Cape Cod at MSG."
01:04:30;01:04:34;"- I wanna do it so badly now."

01:05:11;01:05:12;"I haven't played shows in years,"
01:05:12;01:05:15;"outside of the little Bernie Sanders gigs,"
01:05:15;01:05:16;"I haven't played shows in years."
01:05:16;01:05:17;"- And my 40th birthday."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"- Oh, and I jumped on stage at your 40th birthday,"
01:05:19;01:05:20;"that was about it."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"- That's crazy, dude, years."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"- Or yeah, yeah, three years."
01:05:24;01:05:27;"Three years since the last proper Vampire Show."
01:05:27;01:05:29;"- That's gonna be crazy when you play that first gig."
01:05:29;01:05:32;"- It's gonna be, yeah, we'll probably have to do a small one."
01:05:32;01:05:33;"- Troubadour, dude."
01:05:33;01:05:33;"- Troubadour."
01:05:33;01:05:36;"- That's the show to see."
01:05:36;01:05:39;"- I also just feel like, you know,"
01:05:39;01:05:41;"it can be really confusing about your relationship"
01:05:41;01:05:44;"with your fans, 'cause like, you go on social media,"
01:05:44;01:05:47;"you get like the most, like, people say crazy stuff to you,"
01:05:47;01:05:50;"like you got haters, and I have to believe, though,"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"like I'm a fan of a lot of stuff,"
01:05:52;01:05:53;"and if I wanna go see an artist,"
01:05:53;01:05:55;"and I caught them on like an awkward night"
01:05:55;01:05:59;"where they (beep) up, they had a laugh about something,"
01:05:59;01:06:02;"they did something kinda weird that fell a little flat,"
01:06:02;01:06:03;"I would rather see that show."
01:06:03;01:06:04;"- Oh, yeah."
01:06:04;01:06:06;"- 'Cause also, I'll tell you, I'm not gonna name names,"
01:06:06;01:06:07;"'cause I don't wanna throw anybody under the bus,"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"and I think we need all types of stuff"
01:06:09;01:06:12;"in the music industry, but I was like watching"
01:06:12;01:06:17;"some artists recently who were doing a huge spectacle show,"
01:06:17;01:06:21;"not talking about Roger Waters, by the way,"
01:06:21;01:06:24;"and the first five minutes, I was like blown away,"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"and I was just like, this is incredible,"
01:06:26;01:06:29;"the showmanship, the stage show, the video,"
01:06:29;01:06:32;"like I was like, wow, these people shot a feature film,"
01:06:32;01:06:33;"they did everything."
01:06:33;01:06:34;"- Wow."
01:06:34;01:06:35;"- And even the, it really blew me away,"
01:06:35;01:06:37;"and then the artistry was very high,"
01:06:37;01:06:38;"and these are artists that I respect,"
01:06:38;01:06:41;"but I felt for me as a fan, after 10 or 15 minutes,"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"it's like you get used to anything."
01:06:43;01:06:46;"You go live in a mansion, after a while--"
01:06:46;01:06:47;"- You get used to the view."
01:06:47;01:06:48;"- You get used to the view, and you're like,"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"somebody comes over, like, this view's incredible,"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"and you're just like, yeah, whatever,"
01:06:52;01:06:53;"you wanna see my PlayStation?"
01:06:53;01:06:54;"Like, that's what happens."
01:06:54;01:06:57;"So anyway, after 10 or 15 minutes, I was like,"
01:06:57;01:06:57;"honestly, there might--"
01:06:57;01:06:58;"- Look at that Twitter."
01:06:58;01:07:01;"- Yeah, there might as well, this stuff on stage,"
01:07:01;01:07:03;"it's like, but anyway, that's me,"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"but I have to believe that some of our fans"
01:07:05;01:07:07;"are probably not that different."
01:07:07;01:07:10;"They wanna see that eight minute Cape of God,"
01:07:10;01:07:11;"with, might have a few bum notes."
01:07:11;01:07:14;"- That's the most exciting part."
01:07:14;01:07:15;"- Yeah, it's like, whoa."
01:07:15;01:07:18;"- I guess you'll see who your real fans are."
01:07:18;01:07:21;"If you take it out, and let it be a little rough"
01:07:21;01:07:24;"around the edges, and people are just confused,"
01:07:24;01:07:27;"and they're like, these guys suck, and they walk,"
01:07:27;01:07:29;"well, then they walk."
01:07:29;01:07:32;"- All right, we're just, back to--"
01:07:32;01:07:35;"- We're on the path to you playing--"
01:07:35;01:07:36;"- Back to the Mercury Land."
01:07:36;01:07:39;"- 200 people in about four years."
01:07:39;01:07:43;"- Okay, so eight minute Cape--"
01:07:43;01:07:44;"- But it's all heads."
01:07:44;01:07:45;"- It's all heads, eight minute Cape Cod."
01:07:45;01:07:47;"- It's all heads."
01:07:47;01:07:49;"That's the thing, dude, it's like--"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"- 37 people in Madison, Wisconsin."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"- This is like classic--"
01:07:52;01:07:53;"- Hemorrhaging money."
01:07:53;01:07:57;"- Got this new van, it's just a money pit."
01:07:57;01:08:03;"- Oh man, it's back to the old days,"
01:08:03;01:08:08;"waking up at 7 a.m., CT driving from Boise to Salt Lake."
01:08:08;01:08:13;"- That's a funny one, though, it's like,"
01:08:13;01:08:16;"play to like, I don't know, 7,000 people that are like,"
01:08:16;01:08:20;"yeah, I've heard of this band, oh, you got tickets, cool."
01:08:20;01:08:23;"As opposed to like 300 people that are just like,"
01:08:23;01:08:27;"know every word, and are just like, fired up."
01:08:27;01:08:29;"- That's a space where I could really excel, though."
01:08:29;01:08:30;"- Oh my God, yeah."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"- Being the band that like, (beep) up a lot."
01:08:32;01:08:33;"(laughing)"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"- I love this direction, I'm like,"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"kind of surprised to hear that you're so open"
01:08:37;01:08:40;"to these dynamics."
01:08:40;01:08:42;"- Well, you know what, I've never felt super confident"
01:08:42;01:08:45;"in the show, partially because, you know,"
01:08:45;01:08:48;"we've had great shows, but partially because"
01:08:48;01:08:51;"we work so hard on the albums."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"So much attention to detail on the albums,"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"raking myself and everybody else over the coals,"
01:08:55;01:08:57;"like, hard, hardcore."
01:08:57;01:08:59;"And then by the time you get on the road,"
01:08:59;01:09:00;"it's like you're exhausted, and all you wanna do"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"is just make sure it works."
01:09:02;01:09:03;"- Yeah."
01:09:03;01:09:06;"- You know, it's like, it is hard to feel relaxed"
01:09:06;01:09:07;"about the shows, but I'm okay with letting the albums"
01:09:07;01:09:09;"be the albums, and the shows be the shows."
01:09:09;01:09:10;"- Oh, for sure."
01:09:10;01:09:12;"Yeah, I mean, like, the live versions are gonna have"
01:09:12;01:09:13;"their own life."
01:09:13;01:09:16;"- Eight Minute Cape Cod."
01:09:16;01:09:17;"I hope I didn't pick the wrong song,"
01:09:17;01:09:21;"'cause like, I think now a few heads will be expecting"
01:09:21;01:09:23;"an Eight Minute Cape Cod, it might be a different song."
01:09:23;01:09:25;"Well, we'll try it, that's the thing, we gotta try it."
01:09:25;01:09:26;"- I think Kids Don't Stand a Chance,"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"you could really take that out."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"- Interesting."
01:09:29;01:09:31;"Yeah, there's a while we didn't play it that much."
01:09:31;01:09:33;"- I used to find it hard to sing live."
01:09:33;01:09:34;"I'm getting into it."

01:13:08;01:13:10;"All right, you ready for the top five?"
01:13:10;01:13:13;"- It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:13:13;01:13:19;"- So today we're gonna go through the top five songs"
01:13:19;01:13:20;"on iTunes, but we're gonna compare them"
01:13:20;01:13:23;"to the top five songs of 1983."
01:13:23;01:13:25;"Why 1983?"
01:13:25;01:13:26;"- Reading Rainbow."
01:13:26;01:13:28;"- Right, Reading Rainbow debuted in 1983."
01:13:28;01:13:31;"I was not alive in '83."
01:13:31;01:13:32;"- I was six."
01:13:32;01:13:33;"- You were six?"
01:13:33;01:13:35;"I was one year out from being born."
01:13:35;01:13:36;"- Conceived?"
01:13:36;01:13:37;"- Yeah, I was born in April, so I was a little bit"
01:13:37;01:13:38;"conceived in '83."
01:13:38;01:13:42;"- Conceived in July of '83."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"- The summer of '83?"
01:13:44;01:13:45;"Yeah, I guess this probably was right around--"
01:13:45;01:13:48;"- Summer of '83."
01:13:48;01:13:49;"- This is right around the time I would've"
01:13:49;01:13:50;"come onto the scene."
01:13:50;01:13:53;"So the number five song, This Week in 1983,"
01:13:53;01:13:56;"is from a little album called Thriller."
01:13:56;01:13:57;"- Oh."
01:13:59;01:14:02;"- So many big songs on this album, I mean."
01:14:02;01:14:03;"One of the biggest albums of all time."
01:14:03;01:14:05;"Maybe the biggest album of all time."
01:14:08;01:14:31;"- This is track one on Thriller."
01:14:31;01:14:33;"It's a good one."
01:14:33;01:14:38;"Thriller, I'm gonna go this one, PYT, and Human Nature"
01:14:38;01:14:39;"are my standout tracks."
01:14:39;01:14:42;"♪ Tell me that it's human nature ♪"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"♪ Why, why ♪"
01:14:44;01:14:47;"- Yeah, I mean, if I actually like, obviously, Thriller--"
01:14:47;01:14:48;"- Like, pound for pound, what are you gonna,"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"top three on Thriller?"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"- Nah, definitely PYT."
01:14:52;01:14:53;"- Yeah."
01:14:53;01:14:54;"- Yeah, 'cause it's like, you've heard Beat It"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"and Thriller so many times."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"- Yeah."
01:14:57;01:14:58;"- Like, you're not gonna pick those as your top three."
01:14:58;01:14:59;"- Billie Jean, I've heard it too many times."

01:30:11;01:30:13;"was just sanding off all the edges"
01:30:13;01:30:17;"of, like, a previously dominant and avant-garde art form."

01:38:30;01:38:32;"Oh, I gotta say it."
01:38:32;01:38:35;"We have so few songs in the top five."
01:38:35;01:38:38;"There was the one that was about the single mom called ""Rockabye."""
01:38:38;01:38:42;"There's so few songs that actually paint a story about a struggling working people"
01:38:42;01:38:45;"that it's like--I guess ""Flashdance"" lyrically doesn't,"
01:38:45;01:38:48;"but when you hear a song like that on the radio and it's a big movie,"
01:38:48;01:38:52;"everybody knows this is about that woman who welds all day,"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"strips all night, and is following her dreams."
01:38:54;01:38:56;"I like that."
01:38:56;01:38:59;"So anyway, the number three song right now, back in 2017,"
01:38:59;01:39:02;"Demi Lovato, ""Sorry Not Sorry."""
01:39:02;01:39:05;"What do you think the story is with this one?"
01:39:05;01:39:08;"Have we heard this? No, I think this is new."
01:39:08;01:39:10;"I've heard of the name Demi Lovato. Who is that?"
01:39:10;01:39:13;"She's like a big star."
01:39:13;01:39:16;"Oh, a star. She's a major star."
01:39:16;01:39:18;"Wait, did she sing at the Republican convention?"
01:39:18;01:39:22;"No. I mean--"
01:39:22;01:39:26;"Oh, one of the songwriters on this, Sean Douglas, Michael Keaton's son."
01:39:26;01:39:31;"What? Michael Keaton's son, Sean Douglas, is a major pop writer."
01:39:31;01:39:44;"Really?"
01:39:44;01:39:48;"Oh, that chord progression."
01:39:48;01:39:51;"I'm probably thinking about Michael Keaton here in this."
01:39:51;01:39:55;"Pretty good work, son."
01:39:55;01:39:59;"Keaton's like, ""Well, you know, I like the Eagles, and what's up, I'm a grateful dad."""
01:39:59;01:40:02;"Sean."
01:40:02;01:40:05;"Sean, I--"
01:40:05;01:40:07;"Yeah, it's just not--"
01:40:07;01:40:09;"It's not a palette I understand."
01:40:09;01:40:12;"I love you, son."
01:40:12;01:40:14;"This is unlistenable."
01:40:14;01:40:16;"This is garbage."
01:40:16;01:40:19;"All right, come on. Sean, you--"
01:40:19;01:40:24;"The '80s, you know, this is a solo Don Henley, Glenn Fry, baby."
01:40:24;01:40:27;"This is that."
01:40:27;01:40:36;"I'm sure Michael Keaton's very proud of this song."
01:40:36;01:40:52;"I mean, it's a good song. Wait, what is this referencing?"
01:40:52;01:40:57;"This is essentially like a rewrite of Rihanna ""Needed Me."""
01:40:57;01:40:58;"You're not familiar with that one, Jack?"
01:40:58;01:41:01;"That's a tight call, but I don't know what you're talking about."
01:41:01;01:41:06;"You'd probably like it. It was a good song on Rihanna's ""Glass"" record that ended up being a very big single."
01:41:06;01:41:14;"It was kind of like the first big hit song where a woman explicitly referred to herself as a savage."
01:41:14;01:41:21;"And it had a similar concept of basically being like, ""I don't need you. You're the one who needed me."""
01:41:21;01:41:24;"So it's like a similar kind of like kiss-off."
01:41:24;01:41:28;"Where you're saying, ""I'm a savage. I don't care about your feelings."""
01:41:28;01:41:30;"Anyway, back to 1983."
01:41:30;01:41:31;"Legit."
01:41:31;01:41:35;"Eddie Grant, ""Electric Avenue."" This is a fun song."
01:41:35;01:41:37;"Who doesn't like this song?"
01:41:37;01:41:38;"Me."
01:41:38;01:41:39;"You don't like this song?"
01:41:39;01:41:40;"No."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"Wait, you don't like reggae?"
01:41:42;01:41:45;"I like reggae."
01:41:45;01:41:49;"Whoa."
01:41:49;01:41:51;"It's funky."
01:41:51;01:41:54;"That's a cool part."
01:41:54;01:41:56;"The verse is tight."
01:41:56;01:41:58;"Wait, maybe I'm thinking of something else."
01:41:58;01:42:00;"Yeah, this is tight. It's sounding good."
01:42:00;01:42:07;"Also, this is cool. ""Electric Avenue"" is a reference to the first place electricity lit the streets in the area of Brixton, South London."
01:42:07;01:42:08;"Whoa."
01:42:08;01:42:10;"Have you ever been to Brixton in London?"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"Yeah, I have actually."
01:42:12;01:42:15;"It's where Brixton Academy is."
01:42:15;01:42:18;"I think now they're dealing with gentrification and become kind of hipstered out."
01:42:18;01:42:21;"But for a long time it was known as one of the major Caribbean neighborhoods."
01:42:21;01:42:22;"Yeah, yeah."
01:42:22;01:42:25;"In 1981 there was a riot, the Brixton Riot."
01:42:25;01:42:27;"People dealing with police brutality and stuff."
01:42:27;01:42:31;"So actually, it says that Eddie Grant wrote this song in response to the riots."
01:42:31;01:42:35;"Where there were a lot of Caribbean immigrants, high unemployment, getting ignored."
01:42:35;01:42:42;"So actually, this kind of feel-good song kind of has almost a political backstory."
01:42:54;01:42:56;"Yeah, I'm into this song."
01:43:04;01:43:06;"I just want to make sure we're getting the lyrics."
01:43:06;01:43:09;"This is the verse."
01:43:09;01:43:12;"""Down the street there's violence and lots of work to be done."
01:43:12;01:43:17;"No place to hang out or washing and I can't blame all on the sun."""
01:43:17;01:43:18;"Interesting."
01:43:18;01:43:21;"And then the verse is, ""We're going to rock down to Electric Avenue and then we'll take it higher."""
01:43:21;01:43:25;"So maybe it's almost like, ""F*ck it. It's riot time."""
01:43:25;01:43:29;"Second verse, ""Working so hard like a soldier, can't afford a thing on TV."""
01:43:29;01:43:30;"I love that."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"That's a very Bruce line."
01:43:31;01:43:33;"It's like watching TV."
01:43:33;01:43:34;"It's like, ""I can't afford it."""
01:43:34;01:43:38;"""I own commercials and I can't afford it."""
01:43:38;01:43:46;"""They're trying to sell me a 64-inch plasma, wall-mounted flat screen."""
01:43:46;01:43:48;"Wow, these are heavy lyrics."
01:43:48;01:43:49;"I've never really..."
01:43:49;01:43:53;"It's like that whole, ""Working so hard like a soldier, can't afford a thing on TV."
01:43:53;01:43:55;"Deep in my heart I abhor ya."
01:43:55;01:43:58;"Can't get food for them, kid. Good God."""
01:43:58;01:43:59;"This is heavy."
01:43:59;01:44:02;"""I'm working all day. Come home and watch TV."""
01:44:02;01:44:04;"And actually, I love that because that's a good point."
01:44:04;01:44:07;"It's like, ""You work all day. You come home to relax."""
01:44:07;01:44:11;"And this is before you could fast forward through the commercials."
01:44:11;01:44:14;"You're just subjugated."
01:44:14;01:44:17;"That's brutal. That's a real brutal take on catabolism."
01:44:17;01:44:20;"""Get home, sit down and finally relax."""
01:44:20;01:44:21;"""Crack one."""
01:44:21;01:44:22;"""Crack a brew."""
01:44:22;01:44:23;"""Ads."""
