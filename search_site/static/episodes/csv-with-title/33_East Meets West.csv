00:00;00:05;"It's the final time crisis of 2016."
00:05;00:10;"I don't want to dwell on the past, I want to look to the future."
00:10;00:15;"So we're going to bring together Time Crisis East and West to heal some wounds."
00:15;00:18;"We got Despot, Jonah Hill, and Jake Longstreth."
00:18;00:24;"We're going to talk to Connor Kilpatrick about what a socialist Christmas will look like."
00:24;00:27;"All this, plus the biggest songs of the year."
00:27;00:31;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:31;00:33;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
00:33;00:34;"Sport!"
00:34;00:35;"One."
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:41;00:48;"The war I fell to, I believe, all my rightful chances."
00:48;00:56;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:56;01:03;"And so I dealt to the floor, when the boss had to go."
01:03;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:13;01:18;"Leave the lonely bare."
01:18;01:20;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
01:20;01:24;"This is the final time crisis of 2016."
01:24;01:27;"So as always, we have Jake in the building."
01:27;01:28;"What's up, Jake?"
01:28;01:29;"Hey."
01:29;01:32;"But we decided to mix things up, because this is a crazy year."
01:32;01:33;"Nothing makes sense anymore."
01:33;01:37;"So we're combining Time Crisis East with Time Crisis West."
01:37;01:41;"So from Time Crisis East, we have Deathspot."
01:41;01:42;"What's up, Deathspot?"
01:42;01:43;"Hi there."
01:43;01:46;"We also got Jonah Hill, who's more known as a Time Crisis East guy."
01:46;01:47;"That's true."
01:47;01:49;"Wait, why are you more East, not West?"
01:49;01:51;"Hold on a sec, who's that voice?"
01:51;01:52;"The audience doesn't even know."
01:52;01:54;"The audience doesn't even know."
01:54;01:56;"A voice just jumped in."
01:56;01:59;"People, who is that?"
01:59;02:02;"That's a special guest we have for five minutes."
02:02;02:05;"His name is Michael Diamond, a.k.a. Mike D."
02:05;02:06;"What's up, Mike D?"
02:06;02:08;"What's up?"
02:08;02:09;"How are you feeling?"
02:09;02:10;"Not bad."
02:10;02:13;"Well, it's the last time crisis of 2016, so it's a little bittersweet."
02:13;02:14;"Yeah?"
02:14;02:15;"It's been quite a wild year."
02:15;02:21;"Today on the show, we're just going to talk about what's going on in the country."
02:21;02:23;"We're going to reflect a little bit on 2016."
02:23;02:26;"And also, we're going to look forward to Christmas."
02:26;02:32;"On our last episode, we talked to a socialist and a conservative."
02:32;02:36;"We decided that our hearts lied a little more with the socialist, so we're going to have him back on."
02:36;02:41;"You know, on Time Crisis, we're very into fast food and snack foods."
02:41;02:47;"And we've been very critical of President-elect Trump on this show."
02:47;02:53;"And we've been critical of some of his cabinet appointments, but there's one that kind of caught our eye."
02:53;02:56;"Jake, you want to tell the people about one of Trump's recent appointments?"
02:56;02:58;"Andrew Puzder?"
02:58;03:00;"Wait, is it Pudzer or Puzder?"
03:00;03:02;"I think it's Puzder."
03:02;03:04;"P-U-Z-D-E-R."
03:04;03:05;"You can call him Andy."
03:05;03:06;"Rolls off the tongue."
03:06;03:07;"Andy Puzder."
03:07;03:08;"Either way, it's a pretty good name."
03:08;03:10;"CEO of CKE Enterprises."
03:10;03:11;"What's that?"
03:11;03:14;"Carl Karcher Enterprises."
03:14;03:18;"Carl Karcher founded Carl's Jr. in the '50s."
03:18;03:20;"So there is a Carl in Carl's Jr."
03:20;03:21;"Yeah, Carl Karcher."
03:21;03:32;"Classic dude from Ohio, served in World War II, moves to SoCal, sees McDonald's popping off, starts Carl's Jr., grows the empire."
03:32;03:41;"And then Puzder is a trial lawyer in St. Louis and somehow bros down with Carl Karcher in his twilight years."
03:41;03:44;"And he became the heir apparent."
03:44;03:45;"Yeah."
03:45;03:48;"Andy, I like you. If there's somebody who's going to keep running my business."
03:48;03:57;"There was an article from Business Insider in March of this year where he was just like, ""I want to replace humans with machines in the workplace."""
03:57;04:01;"And then he becomes appointed the Secretary of Labor, which is..."
04:01;04:03;"That's how things are going right now."
04:03;04:09;"Man. Okay, well, first of all, is Carl's Jr. even good?"
04:09;04:10;"Who's had Carl's Jr. here?"
04:10;04:12;"I have, but I don't remember."
04:12;04:15;"You already know I have, man."
04:15;04:16;"Jonah, what's--"
04:16;04:19;"You have not asked with--you asked with Carl's Jr."
04:19;04:20;"Huh?"
04:20;04:21;"You asked with Carl's Jr."
04:21;04:25;"I was good friends with Carl Sr. a long time ago."
04:25;04:27;"That's the worst joke ever."
04:27;04:29;"That's the stupidest joke ever."
04:29;04:30;"Bless his soul."
04:30;04:34;"I had Carl's Jr. probably for the last time. Like, in high school, we would hit Carl's Jr. a lot."
04:34;04:39;"I thought you were ride or die for Fatburger as a born and raised L.A. guy."
04:39;04:40;"Yeah, yeah."
04:40;04:41;"What happened to that?"
04:41;04:45;"Well, first of all, Apple Pan, if you're from the West Coast, you know what Apple Pan is."
04:45;04:46;"Apple Pan's not fast food."
04:46;04:47;"That's like a chain, is it?"
04:47;04:51;"I don't consider Fatburger fast food because it's made to order, right?"
04:51;04:52;"Mm."
04:52;04:53;"Uh."
04:53;04:54;"Debatable."
04:54;04:56;"But, I mean, it's literally--it's not a drive-thru."
04:56;04:58;"You go in, order, and they make it."
04:58;04:59;"It is a drive-thru."
04:59;05:00;"Nuh-uh."
05:00;05:02;"The Fatburger in Vermont, yeah."
05:02;05:04;"Okay, that one Fatburger is drive-thru."
05:04;05:05;"The rest are not."
05:05;05:08;"So, what do you call--if Fatburger is not fast food--"
05:08;05:09;"That's the Fatburger I know."
05:09;05:10;"What is it?"
05:10;05:11;"It's a hamburger place."
05:11;05:13;"Are all hamburgers fast food?"
05:13;05:16;"You go to Manetta Tavern and you order a hamburger, are you eating fast food?"
05:16;05:17;"No."
05:17;05:18;"Shut the f--- up, then."
05:18;05:19;"Fair enough."
05:19;05:22;"Don't talk to me like that."
05:22;05:25;"Alec, you had my back this whole time."
05:25;05:26;"That's true."
05:26;05:27;"So, what's your take on Carl's Jr.?"
05:27;05:28;"Why'd you stop going there?"
05:28;05:31;"It's not good to eat processed fast food, right?"
05:31;05:33;"So, Carl's Jr. is legitimate fast food?"
05:33;05:36;"Yeah, it's like--that's for sure a fast food place."
05:36;05:39;"But do you respect Andy Puzder for the empire he's helped build?"
05:39;05:41;"I respect him for his name."
05:41;05:42;"Yeah, this is a sick name."
05:42;05:47;"Anyone with the balls to walk around being called Puzder is a dude I respect."
05:47;05:55;"All--you know, I have empathy for the man growing up with the name Puzder, Pudster, whatever it is."
05:55;05:58;"I have never eaten at Carl's Jr. in my life."
05:58;06:02;"I would--why would you--it's like a fourth-tier fast food spot."
06:02;06:03;"I actually would disagree."
06:03;06:05;"It's a lateral move from Burger King."
06:05;06:08;"I would say it's a forward move."
06:08;06:12;"Where's Wendy's at if we're talking tiers?"
06:12;06:15;"Wendy's represents itself as if it's like a fat burger."
06:15;06:19;"You also have Dave from Wendy's as the figurehead."
06:19;06:20;"Guys, let's be real."
06:20;06:23;"Wendy's is half a step up from dog food."
06:23;06:24;"Oh, okay."
06:24;06:28;"How many steps up from dog food is McDonald's?"
06:28;06:30;"Half a step below."
06:30;06:32;"It is dog food."
06:32;06:35;"What is the argument that Carl's Jr. is not fast food?"
06:35;06:39;"I don't think I'd even feed my dog McDonald's."
06:39;06:40;"I think they're all the same."
06:40;06:42;"It's like the exact same thing."
06:42;06:48;"I'm not even trying to be funny, but you know whose dog has definitely been fed McDonald's?"
06:48;06:49;"Suge Knight."
06:49;06:51;"Oh, that's a good one."
06:51;06:52;"I don't know why I went with that."
06:52;06:53;"I'm just saying."
06:53;06:54;"You know what--"
06:54;06:56;"Dancing in the video."
06:56;06:57;"Well, that's the West Coast version."
06:57;07:02;"What East Coast legend has definitely fed his dog McDonald's?"
07:02;07:03;"Howard Stern."
07:03;07:04;"Trump?"
07:07;07:10;"I gave him fifty cents to buy some soup."
07:10;07:11;"You know it's the time."
07:11;07:13;"I wear the fresh Gucci watch."
07:13;07:15;"He's even more ornery than my Lea anytime."
07:15;07:17;"He walks the windows on a Bari at a quarter to four."
07:17;07:20;"Cause he ain't gonna work a main farm no more."
07:20;07:21;"Living on borrowed time."
07:21;07:22;"And borrowed money."
07:22;07:24;"Sleeping in the street day in and day out."
07:24;07:26;"Can't be funny with the hand-me-down food."
07:26;07:27;"And the hand-me-down clothes."
07:27;07:30;"A rockabilly pastor which nobody knows."
07:30;07:32;"Makes his home all over the place."
07:32;07:35;"He goes to sleep by falling down on his face."
07:35;07:38;"Sometimes no. As the leader of the homeless."
07:38;07:40;"Sometimes drunk. The kids are phone-less."
07:40;07:42;"Sleeping on the street in a cardboard box."
07:42;07:45;"Better off drinking than smoking a wad."
07:45;07:50;"Johnny Ryao. Johnny Ryao."
07:50;07:55;"Kicking downtown. Kicking downtown. Kicking cross town."
07:55;08:00;"To Johnny Ryao. To Johnny Ryao."
08:00;08:02;"He drinks. Where he lies. He's covered. With flies."
08:02;08:05;"He's got the hand-me-down. Pumas. And the tie-ties."
08:05;08:07;"When you go upstairs you get your head to get them."
08:07;08:09;"But the bird is the word and your light is a feather."
08:09;08:12;"Detox at the bar. No booze allowed."
08:12;08:14;"Remember the good old days of the rockabilly crowd."
08:14;08:17;"Remember this is where he's from."
08:17;08:19;"He lives in the street but he's no bum."
08:19;08:22;"He's a rockabilly star from the days of old."
08:22;08:24;"He used to have deep old pill giggles."
08:24;08:25;"He got a platinum voice."
08:25;08:27;"Of an only gold record on the bass."
08:27;08:28;"What's booze? He's on a drum."
08:28;08:29;"What's checkers?"
08:29;08:32;"Lolly Pitton with a flute and guitar."
08:32;08:34;"Johnny Ryao. Who do you think you are?"
08:34;08:36;"Johnny Ryao."
08:38;08:43;"Digging the night chain. Digging the OE."
08:43;08:46;"Johnny Ryao."
08:46;08:48;"Johnny Ryao."
08:48;09:01;"Don't joke. He's on a trip. Living in a man's system."
09:01;09:03;"Wearing red bag shoes and singing Hell to Scales."
09:03;09:05;"He asks for a dollar. You know what it's for."
09:05;09:08;"Marry bottle after bottle. He always needs more."
09:08;09:10;"He's no less important than your working class kids."
09:10;09:13;"He drinks a lot of liquor but he don't drink piss."
09:13;09:15;"He paid his dues. Playing the blues."
09:15;09:18;"He claims that he wore the blue suede shoes."
09:18;09:20;"Oh, shame to say when he went into the army."
09:20;09:22;"That's right. The John in his name is Johnny."
09:22;09:25;"Johnny Ryao."
09:25;09:27;"Johnny Ryao."
09:29;09:35;"Johnny Ryao."
09:35;09:37;"Johnny Ryao."
09:38;09:44;"Anyway, so Andy Puzder, as cool as it is what he's done with Carl's Jr."
09:44;09:46;"And Hardee's, right? It's the same company?"
09:46;09:47;"Yeah."
09:47;09:48;"Hardee's is like a different version."
09:48;09:49;"Parent company."
09:49;09:52;"As cool as it is what he's built in terms of brand building."
09:52;09:57;"We're all people who respect brand building but the idea..."
09:57;10:00;"I gotta say, these like scumbag fast food guys."
10:00;10:04;"It's like, it's literally the most abusive mentality."
10:04;10:10;"So this year you had all these minimum wage workers, a lot of them in fast food, doing the fight for 15."
10:10;10:14;"What's the minimum wage now? Is it $7.25 or $8.25?"
10:14;10:16;"It's state."
10:16;10:17;"State is $10. Federal."
10:17;10:19;"Like California, we have a higher."
10:19;10:20;"Right, so federal minimum wage."
10:20;10:21;"$7.25 federal."
10:21;10:22;"$7.25."
10:22;10:26;"So these people are asking for $15 an hour."
10:26;10:30;"And truthfully, when you do the math, you really can't live."
10:30;10:31;"No."
10:31;10:34;"And especially if you're not getting health insurance, especially if you have a family,"
10:34;10:36;"you're going to be in dire straits if you actually make $7.25."
10:36;10:38;"You could work 80 hours a week."
10:38;10:40;"So it's a fairly modest ask."
10:40;10:44;"And all these scumbag fast food dudes."
10:44;10:48;"Also, it's so funny and abusive because they're basically like, ""Well, guys, yeah, I get it."
10:48;10:55;"You want to make $15 an hour but the thing is if you ask for $15 an hour, I'm going to have to replace you with a robot."""
10:55;10:57;"So, you know, it's like they're just abusing them."
10:57;10:59;"Yeah, and they're so profitable too."
10:59;11:00;"Robots."
11:00;11:01;"No, those companies."
11:01;11:02;"Right."
11:02;11:03;"Well, I mean--"
11:03;11:04;"Those fast food companies."
11:04;11:06;"It'll go into hyperdrive if they get robots."
11:06;11:12;"Also, but it's so short-sighted because all these rich people, the Trumps, the Puzzders,"
11:12;11:14;"all of these people--"
11:14;11:17;"How rich are the Puzzders comparatively?"
11:17;11:18;"Like Trump?"
11:18;11:19;"Carl's Jr. money?"
11:19;11:21;"Well, nobody knows how much money Trump does."
11:21;11:22;"He's the owner of Carl's Jr.?"
11:22;11:23;"CEO."
11:24;11:25;"Okay, he's paid."
11:25;11:26;"He's paid."
11:26;11:29;"If they put all these people out of business and replace them with robots, okay, you're"
11:29;11:31;"going to make a little extra money in the meantime."
11:31;11:35;"What are you going to do when there's millions of angry, starving people around the country?"
11:35;11:36;"You dummies."
11:36;11:38;"They're going to come for you, Puzzder."
11:38;11:41;"You just sick the angry, starving robots on them."
11:41;11:43;"They're going to need some robots."
11:43;11:44;"Right."
11:44;11:47;"Well, and the robots are going to get-- they're going to have their own artificial intelligence."
11:47;11:48;"Yeah."
11:48;11:53;"Also, robots notoriously don't know about Chicken McNuggets and how they're supposed"
11:53;11:54;"to be cooked."
11:54;11:56;"Yeah, they're going to overcook those burgers."
11:56;11:57;"Oh, God, yeah, seriously."
11:57;11:59;"So the quality is definitely going to go down."
11:59;12:00;"Will it?"
12:00;12:02;"Or it'll just be another constipation."
12:02;12:03;"You know what, though?"
12:03;12:06;"The only thing is robots can't be-- well, they can be disgruntled, but they don't have"
12:06;12:08;"fluid to put into the food."
12:08;12:10;"They could throw it on the floor."
12:10;12:11;"That's true."
12:12;12:13;"The floor is probably mad clean, though."
12:13;12:14;"Oh, yeah."
12:14;12:15;"Because it's robots."
12:15;12:17;"You're just saying that an angry robot can't spit in your burger."
12:17;12:20;"So people who are mistreated at fast food restaurants probably with food, right?"
12:20;12:25;"Who are treated by customers and supervisors."
12:25;12:26;"They definitely do."
12:26;12:32;"If you piss a robot off, they don't have spit to put into your food."
12:32;12:33;"Not yet."
12:33;12:37;"Yeah, but they might just come out straight up, attack you, and they might chop your dick"
12:37;12:38;"off."
12:38;12:39;"That's true."
12:39;12:42;"And Alec says they might just-- there's other ways to get stuff dirty."
12:42;12:43;"Toilet."
12:44;12:48;"Can I pose an existential socialist quandary?"
12:48;12:49;"Yeah."
12:49;12:53;"These jobs we're talking about in the fast food industry, they're crappy jobs."
12:53;12:56;"I wouldn't wish them on anybody."
12:56;13:01;"Anybody that does it, I hope they're able to find something that they love doing better"
13:01;13:04;"and are able to make it work doing that."
13:04;13:07;"Because they're being treated like shit."
13:07;13:08;"They're not getting paid."
13:08;13:11;"They're getting paid like crap."
13:11;13:12;"And it's--"
13:12;13:13;"Right."
13:13;13:14;"Generally, it's considered a rough gig."
13:14;13:16;"It's a very hard existence."
13:16;13:21;"So shouldn't we, as a society anyway, be trying to uplift these people out of these jobs?"
13:21;13:27;"And then in that sense, if we're having a robot do this job, and we can actually motivate"
13:27;13:33;"people or retrain or whatever the method is to uplift people out of that--"
13:33;13:34;"I'm with you."
13:35;13:37;"And I want to ask our socialist guest, Connor Kilpatrick, this later."
13:37;13:42;"But if, in fact, our technology is getting so good that we don't have to make people"
13:42;13:44;"stand over a griddle all day, you're right."
13:44;13:45;"That's not necessarily a bad thing."
13:45;13:48;"But say there aren't jobs for those people."
13:48;13:49;"Are we going to take care of those people?"
13:49;13:51;"Show them basic dignity, give them health care and stuff?"
13:51;13:53;"That's the socialist vision."
13:53;13:57;"The Donald Trump vision is probably going to leave those people out in the streets."
13:57;13:59;"And that's not good for anybody."
13:59;14:04;"Trump, Puzder, these dudes, if you cornered them, you really got their real take on what"
14:04;14:08;"they think of average, hardworking Carl's Jr. employees."
14:08;14:10;"I bet you would hear some gnarly stuff."
14:10;14:11;"Oh, I'm sure."
14:11;14:17;"And I know people are going to bid a fair happy rest of 2016."
14:17;14:20;"And 2017, the time crisis."
14:20;14:21;"The legendary."
14:21;14:23;"The full panel, east and west."
14:23;14:25;"And I think it's very strong, by the way."
14:25;14:30;"I just want to interject that now you guys really united with this very controversial year."
14:30;14:31;"Like Wu-Tang, kind of."
14:31;14:33;"You helped us all heal right now."
14:33;14:34;"Like the Wu-Tang song, ""Reunited."""
14:34;14:36;"Time crisis shows a united front."
14:36;14:42;"Well, so thank you very much to legendary rapper, businessman, radio show host, and"
14:42;14:44;"noted socialist, Michael Diamond."
14:44;14:46;"Mike D of the Beastie Boys."
14:46;14:47;"Thanks for coming through."
14:47;14:49;"Hey, hit Carl's Jr. on the way home."
18:11;18:17;"So bad news for Coke and Pepsi."
18:17;18:21;"There's some new data coming out about who's actually drinking them."
18:21;18:24;"And it's kind of interesting."
18:24;18:28;"Coke's largest audience is 35 to 44."
18:28;18:30;"Drinkership, it's called."
18:30;18:32;"Drinkership."
18:32;18:35;"Coke is killing it with the 35 to 44-year-olds."
18:35;18:37;"That's such a weird demographic."
18:37;18:40;"Does that just mean like kind of new parents?"
18:40;18:42;"That's cocaine."
18:42;18:44;"Oh, that's cocaine."
18:44;18:46;"You got to stay up for the babies."
18:46;18:48;"I'm right in that demo."
18:48;18:51;"So Coke's killing it with the 35 to 44-year-olds."
18:51;18:53;"Where do you guys think Pepsi does the best?"
18:53;18:55;"One to six-year-olds."
18:55;18:57;"Oh, that's a bad dream."
18:57;18:59;"No, no, no."
18:59;19:01;"Like I would say 12."
19:01;19:03;"No, I'm going to say older."
19:03;19:05;"I think old people."
19:05;19:07;"You're right."
19:07;19:09;"So Pepsi's biggest audience, drinkership, is 65 and over."
19:09;19:11;"65?"
19:11;19:13;"I know."
19:13;19:15;"Doesn't that seem so backwards?"
19:15;19:19;"Well, and the real bad news is that they're both tanking in the 18 to 24-year-old demographic."
19:19;19:28;"When a soda tanks with 18 to 24-year-olds, it's bad that you're missing out on the profits of those college students and young people."
19:28;19:30;"Oh, because it's Red Bull, right?"
19:30;19:33;"I guess they're drinking Red Bull, but that also means these people are going to grow up."
19:33;19:36;"They might never even get into Coke or Pepsi."
19:36;19:42;"But you know what surprises me, though, is Coke, just to talk about branding and marketing strategy,"
19:42;19:47;"which is basically all that Time Crisis is about at this point for foods that will ultimately kill you."
19:47;19:50;"Coke, we think of as the heritage brand, right?"
19:50;19:52;"Coke is old school."
19:52;19:54;"Mumford & Sons."
19:54;19:58;"It's Mumford & Sons. It's Polar Bears. It's Christmas. It's America."
19:58;20:02;"Whereas Pepsi is always really trying hard to kind of seem youthful."
20:02;20:05;"Like in the '80s, they were like, ""We're the Pepsi generation."""
20:05;20:07;"Michael Jackson."
20:07;20:08;"Beyonce."
20:08;20:09;"Crystal Pepsi."
20:09;20:11;"Crystal Pepsi, Crystal Castles."
20:11;20:15;"Pepsi's always been trying so hard because it's kind of funny."
20:15;20:18;"They have a club. They just opened a club in New York. You know about that?"
20:18;20:19;"Wait, Pepsi opened a club?"
20:19;20:22;"Pepsi is called the Cola Room, and it's with a K."
20:22;20:23;"We gotta go."
20:24;20:25;"Have you been yet?"
20:25;20:27;"Cola House, my bad."
20:27;20:30;"Who the fuck would go there if you're not making fun of it?"
20:30;20:35;"You know what I mean? The only reason to go is to be an a**hole with your friends and be like, ""We're at the Pepsi nightclub."""
20:35;20:38;"You get a big bottle of Pepsi in an ice bucket."
20:38;20:39;"Are they serving booze?"
20:39;20:40;"Sparklers?"
20:40;20:42;"I think maybe it's more of a restaurant."
20:42;20:45;"It sounds like it's kind of a bar and grill."
20:45;20:49;"They're almost trying to present it as if it's some farm-to-table thing."
20:49;20:56;"""The aptly named Cola House will feature drinks by Alex Ott, a.k.a. Dr. Cocktail."""
20:56;21:00;"Oh, yeah. That guy. Doc Cock, they call him."
21:00;21:04;"""And serve artisanal plates also inspired by the cola nut."""
21:04;21:09;"""By the way, the nuts come from the cola tree, native to Africa."""
21:09;21:11;"I'm like, ""Oh, I like that."""
21:11;21:15;"""The cool factor, Live Nation will plan concerts and events in this intimate setting."""
21:15;21:20;"""And rocker Lenny Kravitz has had a hand in adding glam to the look and feel of this eatery."""
21:20;21:21;"Oh my god."
21:21;21:22;"I'm into it."
21:22;21:28;"Alec, you just kind of dropped one of the most time crisis perfect stories on our lap."
21:28;21:31;"It's got everything. It's got music, Lenny Kravitz."
21:31;21:33;"An intimate evening with Lenny Kravitz."
21:33;21:35;"But for real."
21:35;21:41;"No, no, no. But it's saying Lenny--actually, to be fair to Lenny Kravitz, as Kanye has pointed out back in the day,"
21:41;21:46;"a lot of people think of Lenny as just a rocker, but he's very known for his interior decorating skills."
21:46;21:47;"That's not a joke."
21:47;21:48;"News to me."
21:48;21:49;"You didn't know that?"
21:49;21:50;"I didn't know that either."
21:50;21:51;"I thought you were like a rock guy."
21:51;21:53;"I'm not a Kravitz guy."
21:53;21:55;"Kravitz is the worst."
21:55;21:56;"Oh, man."
21:56;21:57;"You in?"
21:57;22:01;"Well, when his dick came out of the pants, that really--"
22:01;22:03;"And he had a kring on, right? Didn't he?"
22:03;22:05;"I think maybe I ended up being--"
22:05;22:07;"I don't know, Don. I didn't look at the picture for that long, Alec."
22:07;22:09;"I looked at it for a really long time, and I blew it up."
22:09;22:10;"The vine."
22:10;22:12;"Yeah, the vine was incredible."
22:12;22:14;"Because it never stopped, so you could just keep--"
22:14;22:15;"Well, look."
22:15;22:26;"Bringing some of that raw, rugged, East Coast time crisis flavor to the normally mellow West Coast office."
22:26;22:30;"I want to talk about Cola House a little more, because it's such a great story."
22:30;22:37;"You know, in the same way that people never thought that a reality show con man like Trump could become president,"
22:37;22:42;"I don't think it's impossible that Cola House could become one of New York's hottest restaurants."
22:42;22:44;"All these old divisions are kind of crumbling."
22:44;22:46;"Interesting point."
22:46;22:51;"I just think maybe it gets four stars in the New York Times, and it's just kind of like--"
22:51;22:57;"You know, I got to admit, I never thought that a Pepsi-sponsored theme restaurant would actually have great food, but I got to say--"
22:57;22:59;"Stuffed squash was great."
22:59;23:01;"It was actually good, and I'm not trying to be a snob here."
23:01;23:02;"Stuffed Kola Nut."
23:02;23:06;"There's a Mountain Dew brothel that's very interesting that just opened up."
23:06;23:08;"And Jackson Heights."
23:09;23:21;"Here we are, still together, we are."
23:21;23:32;"So much time wasted, playing games with love."
23:32;23:38;"So many tears I've cried, so much pain inside."
23:38;23:44;"But baby, it ain't over 'til it's over."
23:44;23:50;"So many games we've tried to keep our love alive."
23:50;23:55;"But baby, it ain't over 'til it's over."
23:55;23:57;"Who here has ever been to Trump Tower?"
23:57;23:58;"Oh, I have."
23:58;23:59;"I have too."
23:59;24:01;"Why did you guys go to Trump Tower?"
24:01;24:02;"Who goes first?"
24:02;24:03;"Jonah."
24:03;24:05;"I had a meeting with a dude who lived there."
24:05;24:07;"Just straight up lived in Trump Tower?"
24:07;24:10;"If I'm thinking of the right place, yeah."
24:10;24:12;"Fifth Avenue and 55th."
24:12;24:13;"Yeah."
24:13;24:14;"Starbucks in the lobby."
24:14;24:16;"Yeah, and we shot there one time."
24:16;24:18;"Have you ever met Donald?"
24:18;24:19;"Nope."
24:19;24:20;"Have you ever been close to him?"
24:20;24:21;"Not that I know of, no."
24:21;24:22;"Ivanka?"
24:22;24:23;"Nope."
24:23;24:25;"Donald Jr.?"
24:25;24:27;"D3."
24:27;24:28;"His grandson, I'm homies with."
24:28;24:30;"So Jonah, you were telling me about D3."
24:30;24:31;"I'm obsessed with D3."
24:31;24:32;"We haven't heard a lot about it."
24:32;24:33;"Do you know D3?"
24:33;24:34;"No."
24:34;24:35;"Who is D3?"
24:35;24:37;"Donald Jr.'s son is like a little ass baby."
24:37;24:42;"He's like two, and they call him D3, which is so hard."
24:42;24:43;"That's video."
24:43;24:46;"And he's just like another one of those, you know."
24:46;24:50;"Yo, that's really crazy when you keep the same name in the family."
24:50;24:51;"Sounds like he plays for the Clippers."
24:51;24:55;"Like, it sounds like CP3, you know, like Chris Paul or something."
24:55;24:57;"It totally sounds like an athlete."
24:57;24:59;"D3?"
24:59;25:02;"Yeah, just like a big D3 t-shirt."
25:02;25:08;"What's crazy is, I'm not trying to be too pessimistic, but a lot of people are nervous"
25:08;25:12;"that we're currently experiencing the death throes of American democracy."
25:12;25:18;"So say, it's also creepy to think that if Trump actually did establish some sort of"
25:18;25:24;"like, you know, Putin-esque situation where he basically just holds onto power, if he"
25:24;25:30;"wanted to, he could then, when he had to step down, he could make Don Jr. president, and"
25:30;25:32;"then eventually D3."
25:32;25:34;"What about Eric?"
25:34;25:38;"Well, if I was him, I'd rather have 80 years of Donald Trump presidents."
25:38;25:40;"You guys have the same name over and over again."
25:40;25:41;"Like Louis XIV."
25:41;25:42;"Exactly."
25:42;25:43;"D3 looks ill."
25:43;25:44;"He's got braces."
25:44;25:45;"He's not happy."
25:45;25:47;"Oh, D3, he's a little cutie."
25:47;25:51;"You can't, it's not fair to be mean to politicians' kids."
25:51;25:54;"Actually, you know what I was thinking is like, that kid or the kid that everyone's"
25:54;25:58;"like, giving a hard time for like, being sleepy at the election or whatever."
25:58;25:59;"Barron."
26:00;26:01;"It would be really dope if one of those kids ends up-"
26:01;26:02;"Who's kid is that?"
26:02;26:03;"Donald's kid?"
26:03;26:04;"That's his, with Melania."
26:04;26:09;"It'd be really dope if one of those kids ends up really like, indie and cool, kind of."
26:09;26:10;"That would be a major like, cool thing."
26:10;26:11;"D3 could do it."
26:11;26:12;"I think he could."
26:12;26:13;"In like 40 years, he's probably-"
26:13;26:15;"D3's like, goth, like he listens to prayers."
26:15;26:16;"Right."
26:16;26:21;"In like 40 years, he's like a really progressive Democrat."
26:21;26:26;"Running for office, condemning his grandfather's terrible policies from 40 years."
26:26;26:28;"Yeah, stuff like that happens."
26:28;26:32;"What if Donald Trump just comes out and he's like, ""Only thing I work out to is Vampire"
26:32;26:33;"Weekend."""
26:33;26:34;"Oh, God."
26:34;26:38;"On my playlist, all Vampire Weekend."
26:38;26:44;"This kid, Rost, RFC, who's like, kind of legendary like, graffiti writer in New York and like,"
26:44;26:49;"bad guy, like he just did a lot of bad stuff when he was younger."
26:49;26:52;"Now he's like, an older guy and he raps and stuff."
26:52;26:56;"He tweeted at me out of nowhere and he was like, ""Yo, you did a song with Vampire Weekend?"""
26:56;26:58;"And I was like, ""Yeah."""
26:58;27:00;"And he was like, ""That's my favorite band."""
27:00;27:01;"Really?"
27:01;27:03;"I was really surprised by that."
27:03;27:04;"A really bad guy."
27:04;27:10;"He has this big scar on his face and he, you know, did his fair share of jail time."
27:10;27:12;"But he's a pretty good rapper now."
27:12;27:13;"Wow."
27:13;27:15;"Isn't Eric Trump a huge fan?"
27:15;27:16;"Eric Trump?"
27:16;27:17;"Yeah."
27:17;27:21;"No, the only Republican I've ever remotely heard about being a fan is-"
27:21;27:22;"He's just a fan of Ezra."
27:22;27:24;"Like, he just thinks Ezra's cool."
27:24;27:26;"He's just my guy."
27:26;27:27;"Eric Trump."
27:27;27:28;"He's my guy."
27:28;27:33;"The person who was acting as Jeb Bush's PR person or what do you call it, director of"
27:33;27:38;"communications during the election, was kind of like a youngish guy."
27:38;27:42;"And this guy met my sister at some point and I actually wanted to clear the air with him."
27:42;27:43;"I got nothing against him."
27:43;27:48;"So he was working for Jeb and this was at the height of the Republican primary."
27:48;27:52;"And he tweeted at me and I wasn't quite sure if it was real."
27:52;27:55;"He was just like, ""Oh, hey, I see you're out there supporting Bernie."
27:55;28:00;"Well, man, if you ever change your tune, I just played some Vampire Weekend for Jeb"
28:00;28:03;"and he said it was pretty cool,"" or something."
28:03;28:05;"That's mild praise."
28:05;28:06;"Yeah."
28:06;28:08;"I can totally picture Jeb too."
28:08;28:09;"He didn't tell me to turn it off."
28:09;28:12;"He was just playing and he was like, ""I like this band."
28:12;28:13;"Check them out."
28:13;28:14;"What do you think?"""
28:14;28:17;"I could tweet at the guy and he's like, ""This is pretty cool."
28:17;28:18;"I like this."
28:18;28:19;"It's cool."""
28:19;28:23;"And so then at the time I was out there supporting Bernie, so I'd really seem like a real piece"
28:23;28:27;"of if I didn't even go to Hillary, I started supporting Jeb."
28:27;28:31;"So I think I said something like, ""Hey, I don't remember, just something kind of cheeky."
28:31;28:35;"Like, I would love to support Jeb if he renounces his brother and goes full socialist."""
28:35;28:36;"You know, just something like that."
28:36;28:37;"Yeah, yeah."
28:37;28:38;"And that was that."
28:38;28:44;"And then later somehow this guy met my sister and maybe he implied to her, like he didn't"
28:44;28:46;"know how to take it."
28:46;28:47;"And I guess I could imagine that."
28:47;28:51;"You're just like a young Republican guy just out there trying to get Jeb Bush elected."
28:51;28:52;"Very earnest."
28:52;28:54;"Yeah, maybe he was being earnest and he felt like I was being too cheeky."
28:54;28:57;"Because the truth is, obviously, you know, I'm not a Republican."
28:57;28:59;"I would never support a Republican."
28:59;29:04;"So I want to say to that guy, thank you for being a fan."
29:04;29:06;"Sorry."
29:06;29:10;"That must have been tough working for Jeb because Trump just savaged him throughout"
29:10;29:11;"the election."
29:11;29:12;"I know that was probably hard."
29:12;29:13;"I want you to know, no hard feelings."
29:13;29:17;"And I hope one day you'll come support the lefties."
29:17;29:19;"You know what I'm saying?"
29:19;29:21;"Stay"
29:22;29:24;"You need to stay"
29:24;29:26;"You can't"
29:26;29:28;"Take"
29:28;29:30;"You need to stay"
29:38;29:40;"About"
29:40;29:42;"Minnesota"

30:07;30:15;"I got gold all over my necklace Tap it up my arms, now my momma think I'm reckless"

30:39;30:47;"I was drivin' out them stacks, throwin' up them racks Almost had a lifetime sentence, but I beat it, shout out to Pat"
30:47;30:54;"Pat, that's my lawyer, he got me off them charges Eight stacks for that boy, he took care of the boy"
30:54;31:01;"Call like Minnesota, call like Minnesota, call like Minnesota, call like Minnesota"
31:01;31:09;"Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat"
31:09;31:16;"'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota"
31:16;31:23;"Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat"
31:23;31:31;"You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat When they say ""Loyalty,"" I'm like, ""That's him or me"""

32:31;32:38;"The trust pop, beam like a Pulsar I can put the heat inside the kitchen like a baller I can **** it up like a lawyer, ain't on no side post"
32:38;32:45;"Beamer shing, beamer shing, I'm quicker than them jelly beans No need to smell it, all is clean, that money talkin' Charles Sheen"
32:45;32:53;"I'm round the Ubers with the toolah, I got more diamonds than your jeweler I make her come back like a Yuki, if you know it, now you knew it"
32:53;33:00;"I aim at her head like a sniper rifle, she can't be my ****, we ain't met no wifey wifey She slip up that lid, now I like it, like it"
33:00;33:07;"No game, then she mic'n'nike it, no knock it, she know I do it My E that be like a hockey pocket, my knock it, she know I do it"
33:07;33:15;"'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota Cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota"
33:15;33:22;"You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat"
33:22;33:30;"'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota"
33:30;33:37;"You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat"
33:37;33:43;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats 1"
33:43;33:47;"Maybe on that note, is it time to start talking about socialism?"
33:47;33:51;"I think we got a pretty good response on the last episode talking about socialism"
33:51;33:52;"Did we?"
33:52;33:55;"Yeah, I saw a handful of tweets"
33:55;33:57;"You saw like 4 tweets"
33:57;34:01;"I saw 4 tweets and my mom said that it was pretty good"
34:01;34:02;"Is your mom a listener?"
34:02;34:04;"I think she listens every week"
34:04;34:08;"And also I just kind of felt like, obviously, like remember when we got in here right after the election"
34:08;34:12;"And we just had to talk about like, what is happening in the world, we feel so dark"
34:12;34:16;"We made a promise to ourselves that we were not gonna forget that feeling"
34:16;34:21;"And we were gonna try to maintain optimism and educate ourselves and do things, you know, in the future"
34:21;34:24;"And we looked at our options, we had socialists and conservatives"
34:24;34:28;"Obviously liberals are not too enticing at the moment"
34:28;34:32;"And I think the socialist guy made a point, so I wanna just keep bringing him back to talk about things"
34:32;34:35;"But while you guys are here, 'cause you weren't on the last episode"
34:35;34:38;"I'm curious, would you guys ever be socialists?"
34:38;34:39;"Yeah"
34:39;34:43;"I need a brief explanation of like what exactly that entails"
34:43;34:48;"I know the basic definition of socialism, but what does that mean for me?"
34:48;34:49;"To be one"
34:49;34:50;"To be one, yeah"
34:50;34:53;"Okay, I guess, do you, just in the most general sense"
34:53;35:00;"Do you believe it's the government's responsibility to minimize inequality between people and provide a safety net for everybody?"
35:00;35:05;"You're not asking do you believe that, no, you're asking would you at some point believe that"
35:05;35:06;"Oh no, do you believe that?"
35:06;35:07;"Oh"
35:07;35:08;"I don't know"
35:08;35:10;"You might not be a socialist"
35:12;35:14;"What do you mean? I'm talking about socialist policy"
35:14;35:19;"Like meaning that the government decides that everything is equal and all, like they are in charge"
35:19;35:24;"Let's not say totally equal, let's just say do you think there should be a baseline for taking care of people in the country"
35:24;35:28;"That if you're an American citizen, you deserve certain things like universal healthcare"
35:28;35:31;"Some kind of basic living wage"
35:31;35:33;"That nobody deserves to die in the street in a rich country"
35:33;35:35;"I mean of course I think that"
35:35;35:37;"You might be a socialist"
35:37;35:38;"What about"
35:38;35:41;"But I imagine it's not as clear cut as that"
35:41;35:43;"Oh you'd be surprised my friend"
35:43;35:46;"No, yeah you're right, of course, in practice these things get more complicated"
35:46;35:55;"Do you think that it's important for there to be labor unions and for workers to be able to collectively bargain for better wages and better conditions and things like
that?"
35:55;35:56;"Yes"
35:56;35:57;"Alright"
35:57;36:01;"I think giving the government that power is scary though to regulate that"
36:01;36:03;"That is, especially in look at our government"
36:03;36:07;"I just think these things are all so perception based"
36:07;36:08;"You know what I mean?"
36:08;36:10;"I don't think that there's like"
36:10;36:12;"Right, so at the very least philosophically"
36:12;36:17;"Would you be okay if a president or a party that you felt like you could more or less trust said to you"
36:17;36:20;"We want to jack your taxes up 10-15%"
36:20;36:24;"And we truly are going to put that money towards taking care of people and blah blah blah"
36:24;36:25;"Would you be cool with that conceptually?"
36:25;36:29;"Of course I do, but then again can you trust them to put that towards the right things?"
36:29;36:33;"I think that is the thing that most people would bump up against, I think, with socialism"
36:33;36:39;"Is trust of the government to actually do the things they're promising to do"
36:39;36:40;"True"
36:40;36:48;"Like in theory, of course, I would agree with all of this and I would be happy to give that percentage of my money to do that"
36:48;36:49;"Right"
36:49;36:50;"Well here's the thing"
36:50;36:58;"We all spend our time thinking about films, programs, songs, mixtapes, paintings"
36:58;37:01;"Junior Western Bacon Cheeseburgers"
37:01;37:02;"We're art boys"
37:02;37:04;"Art Boys 2016 going on 2017"
37:04;37:05;"Bunch of art boys here"
37:05;37:08;"So that's why we gotta call Connor Kilpatrick"
37:08;37:10;"Who writes for a socialist magazine called Jacobin"
37:10;37:14;"And ask him some questions about socialism"
37:14;37:15;"Because it's Christmas time"
37:15;37:18;"My question is what is a socialist Christmas going to be like?"
37:18;37:20;"Because I was raised in a very capitalist society"
37:20;37:22;"Where if you didn't get good presents on Christmas"
37:22;37:27;"If you didn't come back to school after Christmas with some new sneakers"
37:27;37:28;"British Knights"
37:28;37:32;"Some British Knights, maybe a couple power gloves, some new video games"
37:32;37:33;"It was brutal"
37:33;37:38;"My family didn't celebrate Christmas but we even had to jack Hanukkah up just to compete"
37:38;37:41;"So anyway, I want to talk about what's a socialist Christmas going to be like"
37:41;37:42;"So can we get Connor on the phone?"
37:42;37:46;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline"
37:46;37:49;"Hello Connor"
37:49;37:50;"Hey"
37:50;37:51;"Hey what's up man?"
37:51;37:53;"You're on Time Crisis yet again"
37:53;37:54;"You're here with me and Jake"
37:54;37:55;"We got a full house today"
37:55;37:56;"You're also on with Despot and Jonah"
37:56;37:57;"How you doing man?"
37:57;37:58;"I'm doing great"
37:58;38:00;"So we were just talking"
38:00;38:01;"Just four art boys"
38:01;38:08;"Who you know primarily think about rap and movies and paintings and things of that nature"
38:08;38:10;"So we're still trying to educate ourselves about socialism"
38:10;38:11;"So we want to have you back"
38:11;38:14;"And so we thought a good way to talk about this"
38:14;38:16;"Because it's Christmas time"
38:16;38:18;"This is the most wonderful time of the year"
38:18;38:20;"We want to ask you what does a socialist Christmas look like?"
38:20;38:26;"A socialist Christmas is basically more people getting to enjoy Christmas"
38:26;38:31;"You know, not having to bust their asses on Christmas Eve or Christmas"
38:31;38:37;"And having the money and the time and the freedom to buy gifts for loved ones"
38:37;38:40;"And take time off and be able to get together"
38:40;38:44;"If you're someone who's working for 15 bucks an hour"
38:44;38:47;"You're not really having much of a free Christmas"
38:47;38:48;"Even if you can take the time off"
38:48;38:51;"If you can't afford to get gifts for loved ones"
38:51;38:53;"If you can't travel to meet family"
38:53;38:54;"Or if you don't have the time to do it"
38:54;38:59;"So a socialist Christmas would mean more people getting to partake in Christmas if they wanted to"
38:59;39:02;"Okay, so in a socialist society"
39:02;39:05;"More people would be able to take Christmas off"
39:05;39:07;"Relax and spend time with their families"
39:07;39:08;"Yeah"
39:08;39:09;"That sounds pretty good"
39:09;39:12;"But probably the most important thing for most people"
39:12;39:15;"Outside of the deeply religious on Christmas"
39:15;39:16;"Is presents"
39:16;39:17;"Yeah"
39:17;39:19;"So in a socialist society"
39:19;39:21;"Will the presents get worse?"
39:21;39:23;"Will you get less presents?"
39:23;39:26;"Will you have to share presents with your brothers and sisters?"
39:26;39:28;"How's that going to play out?"
39:28;39:31;"Oh no man, socialists are pro-consumption"
39:31;39:35;"They're pro-everybody getting to have good stuff"
39:35;39:37;"Karl Marx himself wrote about that"
39:37;39:39;"He thought it was a civilizing part of society"
39:39;39:42;"So yeah, maybe the super rich kids"
39:42;39:45;"Maybe they won't be getting new yachts and sh*t"
39:45;39:51;"But no, it would mean that most people would be able to get and give more presents"
39:51;39:53;"So the presents even out"
39:53;39:55;"The level of presents is more even"
39:55;39:57;"Yeah, I mean this is the thing"
39:57;40:01;"When you look at American consumption patterns for the past 50 years"
40:01;40:06;"As much as we have this idea that Americans are just buying way more stuff now than they used to"
40:06;40:08;"It's actually not true"
40:08;40:13;"The one really big increase in consumption spending from American households"
40:13;40:16;"In the past 50 years is medical healthcare spending"
40:16;40:19;"And that's a whole other situation"
40:19;40:21;"So yeah, I think it's important to remember that"
40:21;40:23;"Socialists aren't like these hair shirt people"
40:23;40:26;"Who don't want people to have stuff"
40:26;40:29;"Or don't think buying stuff and giving people stuff is good"
40:29;40:31;"They just want everybody to be able to do it"
40:31;40:35;"So there would still be like Xbox and Playstation under socialism?"
40:35;40:36;"Oh hell yeah!"
40:36;40:38;"Would there be less games?"
40:38;40:39;"No, I don't think so at all"
40:39;40:42;"There's a certain component to consumption"
40:42;40:46;"That's part of what Marx called a rich individuality"
40:46;40:49;"And part of helping individuality is developing new needs and wants"
40:49;40:51;"Well so Connor, you're a socialist"
40:51;40:53;"What are you getting people for Christmas?"
40:53;40:55;"Oh my god, I am starting to panic"
40:55;40:57;"I've put it off too long"
40:57;41:00;"Do you feel pressure as somebody who really identifies as a socialist"
41:00;41:02;"And works for a socialist magazine"
41:02;41:06;"That your gifts have to have kind of like a socialist flavor?"
41:06;41:09;"No, I definitely don't feel that way"
41:09;41:11;"I definitely do not feel that way at all"
41:11;41:15;"Can we hear like one example of a gift that you bought someone?"
41:15;41:16;"Anyone?"
41:16;41:17;"I don't want to spoil it"
41:17;41:19;"Well I already got my wife's early present"
41:19;41:23;"And it was that perfume, Jo Malone"
41:23;41:24;"Sounds fancy"
41:24;41:25;"Yeah it is pretty fancy"
41:25;41:27;"Okay so how much was that?"
41:27;41:28;"What's the retail?"
41:28;41:30;"The retail? Oh my god"
41:30;41:32;"It was something like $10 or something"
41:32;41:34;"But so you're saying even in a socialist society"
41:34;41:39;"You can still buy your wife or husband a fancy perfume"
41:39;41:40;"That'll still exist"
41:40;41:42;"But the store might be closed on Christmas Eve"
41:42;41:44;"Yeah, I mean this is the thing I mentioned last time"
41:44;41:49;"It's like socialist beef with markets are with financial markets"
41:49;41:52;"And it's not really with in labor markets"
41:52;41:55;"It's not with markets and consumer goods"
41:55;41:58;"Markets and consumer goods existed before capitalism"
41:58;41:59;"So there'd still be Etsy?"
41:59;42:00;"Yeah there'd be Etsy"
42:00;42:01;"But I've never bought a fancy perfume"
42:01;42:03;"Etsy is pretty socialist I feel like"
42:03;42:04;"Is Etsy socialist?"
42:04;42:06;"Just people making stuff in their houses"
42:06;42:08;"And then other people buy them"
42:08;42:10;"It's like very peer to peer"
42:10;42:12;"Okay so one last question for you Connor"
42:12;42:15;"If we buy what you're selling"
42:15;42:18;"And we decide we want to have a socialist Christmas"
42:18;42:21;"When we go home and we see our mothers and fathers"
42:21;42:25;"Aunts and uncles, little cousins, brothers and sisters"
42:25;42:28;"And we want to actually have a real discussion with them"
42:28;42:31;"About not only the horrible things that are happening in this country"
42:31;42:33;"But a path forward"
42:33;42:35;"Which I know you believe socialism is"
42:35;42:38;"What do you think is something that we can talk about with our family?"
42:38;42:41;"Like what's a question to have a socialist conversation on Christmas?"
42:41;42:42;"Where can we start?"
42:42;42:45;"I think a question to start would be"
42:45;42:48;"About most of the things that Sanders talked about"
42:48;42:50;"Like you can say to your family we're having a great time"
42:50;42:52;"We have the day off"
42:52;42:55;"Or having this wonderful moment where we're getting to see each other"
42:55;42:59;"But don't we believe that everyone should have a right to that?"
42:59;43:01;"Like why should that just be us?"
43:01;43:03;"Shouldn't everybody be able to enjoy?"
43:03;43:05;"And what if my uncle says"
43:05;43:06;"Well I worked really hard all year"
43:06;43:08;"I had to put in extra hours"
43:08;43:10;"And I got enough money that I could take this time off"
43:10;43:12;"If somebody else was lazy"
43:12;43:14;"Or didn't work hard enough to get a good job"
43:14;43:15;"And they got to work on Christmas, that's on them"
43:15;43:18;"I would say take a look outside his window"
43:18;43:19;"And especially in New York"
43:19;43:21;"You're going to see a lot of people"
43:21;43:23;"Busting their asses 60, 70 hours a week"
43:23;43:25;"For very little money"
43:25;43:28;"That it would be a really hard thing"
43:28;43:30;"To be able to spend the money to fly across the country"
43:30;43:32;"And take off several days"
43:32;43:33;"Let alone weeks"
43:33;43:35;"See their family with that kind of salary"
43:35;43:37;"And they're working just as hard as some rich guy"
43:37;43:39;"Sitting in an office"
43:39;43:40;"They're working harder"
43:40;43:41;"So that's what I would say to him"
43:41;43:42;"Fair enough"
43:42;43:43;"I will say that to my uncle"
43:43;43:45;"Well Connor, thank you very much"
43:45;43:48;"Connor Kilpatrick of Jacobin Magazine"
43:48;43:50;"Thank you and have a very Merry Socialist Christmas"
43:50;43:51;"Merry Christmas to you"
43:51;43:52;"Peace"
43:52;43:57;"And so this is Christmas"
43:57;44:02;"And what have you done"
44:02;44:06;"Another year over"
44:06;44:11;"And a new one just begun"
44:11;44:16;"And so this is Christmas"
44:16;44:21;"I hope you've had fun"
44:21;44:26;"The near and the dear ones"
44:26;44:31;"The old and the young"
44:31;44:36;"A Merry Merry Christmas"
44:36;44:41;"And a Happy New Year"
44:41;44:46;"Let's hope it's a good one"
44:46;44:51;"And a Merry Christmas to you"
44:51;44:56;"And a Happy New Year"
44:56;45:01;"So this is Christmas"
45:01;45:06;"For we can fall strong"
45:06;45:11;"The rich and the poor ones"
45:11;45:16;"A Merry Merry Christmas"
45:16;45:21;"For black and for white"
45:21;45:26;"For yellow and red ones"
45:26;45:31;"Let's stop all the bad"
45:31;45:36;"A Merry Merry Christmas"
45:36;45:41;"And a Happy New Year"
45:41;45:46;"Let's hope it's a good one"
45:46;45:51;"Without any fear"
45:51;45:56;"So this is Christmas"
45:56;46:01;"And what have we done"
46:01;46:06;"Another year over"
46:06;46:11;"And a new one just begun"
46:11;46:16;"And so this is Christmas"
46:16;46:21;"I hope you've had fun"
46:21;46:26;"The near and the dear ones"
46:26;46:31;"A Merry Merry Christmas"
46:31;46:36;"And a Happy New Year"
46:36;46:41;"Let's hope it's a good one"
46:41;46:46;"Without any fear"

54:56;55:01;"How do I find you?"
55:01;55:06;"I'm gonna find you"
55:11;55:12;"If I got all these people"
55:12;55:13;"to raise $200,000"
55:13;55:14;"so I could just go have coffee"
55:14;55:17;"with her, something epic has to happen."
55:17;55:18;"You gotta throw it in her face."
55:18;55:20;"Ooh, that'd be, no, I'm gonna go"
55:20;55:21;"on time for that one."
55:21;55:22;"Disrespectful."
55:22;55:23;"I would never throw hot coffee"
55:23;55:24;"in somebody's face."
55:24;55:26;"Yeah, especially her."
55:26;55:28;"You could do that like Tom Cruise"
55:28;55:29;"microphone that squirts water"
55:29;55:32;"that those guys did."
55:32;55:34;"Yeah, I mean, look, Ivanka and I live"
55:34;55:36;"in the same borough of New York."
55:36;55:37;"Oh, you live in New York?"
55:37;55:38;"Yeah, matter of fact,"
55:38;55:39;"talk to my accountant about it."
55:39;55:40;"I was about to call you out, too."
55:40;55:41;"Talk to my accountant."
55:41;55:42;"I was about to call you out, too."
55:42;55:43;"Okay, you know what,"
55:43;55:45;"Time Crisis East has a real issue"
55:45;55:46;"with Ezra Kreisman."
55:46;55:47;"I've never seen you there."
55:47;55:48;"It's really weird."
55:48;55:50;"Come out here, and I, you know,"
55:50;55:51;"I've been here not even a day,"
55:51;55:53;"and here we are together."
55:53;55:54;"Wait, what did they say"
55:54;55:55;"in Westworld?"
55:55;55:56;"What's it get the robots to?"
55:56;55:57;"See, it's all functions."
55:57;55:59;"I got something to say."
55:59;56:00;"Actually, I wanted to say this"
56:00;56:01;"'cause this is the last"
56:01;56:02;"Time Crisis of the year."
56:02;56:04;"Obviously, I spent a lot of time in L.A."
56:04;56:06;"for a plethora of reasons."
56:06;56:08;"One of them being you like it better."
56:08;56:10;"That's so untrue."
56:10;56:11;"Oh."
56:11;56:12;"Especially now."
56:12;56:13;"I gotta get back to spend more time"
56:13;56:15;"in my Manhattan abode"
56:15;56:17;"to even things out with Trump"
56:17;56:18;"running the White House out of there."
56:18;56:19;"But there's many reasons"
56:19;56:21;"I spend time in L.A."
56:21;56:22;"It's not because I like it better."
56:22;56:23;"I like New York better."
56:23;56:24;"But one of the reasons,"
56:24;56:25;"the only one that I feel"
56:25;56:28;"compelled to share with listeners"
56:28;56:30;"is that I work on music."
56:30;56:31;"And I have to say this"
56:31;56:32;"because, I don't know, Jake,"
56:32;56:33;"you and I were actually together"
56:33;56:34;"last New Year's."
56:34;56:35;"We said goodbye to each other"
56:35;56:36;"last New Year's."
56:36;56:37;"That's right."
56:37;56:38;"We were out in Hawaii,"
56:38;56:39;"and I wrote a tweet"
56:39;56:41;"because I know Vampire Weekend fans"
56:41;56:42;"are very patient."
56:42;56:43;"Some of them."
56:43;56:44;"Some of them are very impatient."
56:44;56:45;"But I said, ""2016,"""
56:45;56:47;"'cause I was looking forward to 2016,"
56:47;56:49;"and I said, ""For me, 2016."
56:49;56:51;"""Vampire Weekend"
56:51;56:52;"""and getting jacked/shredded."""
56:52;56:54;"And it's not like I'm posing"
56:54;56:55;"for pictures every day."
56:55;56:56;"I don't know if you guys can tell,"
56:56;56:57;"but I have been spending"
56:57;56:59;"a lot more time in the gym."
56:59;57:00;"I don't think you're jacked or shredded."
57:00;57:02;"Okay, maybe I'm not jacked or shredded."
57:02;57:04;"Are you lifting or are you just doing--"
57:04;57:05;"I've been lifting."
57:05;57:06;"And I just want to say,"
57:06;57:07;"look, take your shirt off."
57:07;57:09;"You're wearing a wild, like,"
57:09;57:10;"workout-y type shirt."
57:10;57:12;"This is a weird polo shirt that I love."
57:12;57:13;"But I'm saying, like, look,"
57:13;57:14;"you guys know I've never been"
57:14;57:15;"in great shape in my life."
57:15;57:16;"I don't know that."
57:16;57:17;"I've been kind of like"
57:17;57:18;"what people call skinny fat."
57:18;57:19;"Parts of my body are skinny."
57:19;57:20;"I've always had a little bit of a gut."
57:20;57:21;"I can relate."
57:21;57:22;"But can you see that"
57:22;57:23;"my shoulders are more defined?"
57:23;57:25;"And I'm not asking for a handout."
57:25;57:26;"Take your shirt off."
57:26;57:27;"I can't tell."
57:27;57:28;"Okay, just--"
57:28;57:29;"Look, I've always been weak"
57:29;57:30;"my whole life."
57:30;57:31;"But look, that's more definition"
57:31;57:32;"than I've ever had."
57:32;57:33;"Okay."
57:33;57:34;"That looks strong."
57:34;57:35;"It's okay."
57:35;57:37;"Look, Alec is a very jacked guy."
57:37;57:38;"Is that the rock?"
57:38;57:39;"I can't see."
57:40;57:41;"That looks like the rock."
57:41;57:42;"That looks like Dwayne."
57:42;57:43;"Tell Vampire Weekend fans"
57:43;57:44;"that this looks like the arms"
57:44;57:45;"of somebody who's trying."
57:45;57:47;"What are you benching these days?"
57:47;57:48;"We don't always bench."
57:48;57:50;"We do more like free weight."
57:50;57:51;"Body resistance."
57:52;57:53;"Aerobics."
57:53;57:54;"So what I'm saying is,"
57:54;57:55;"just can the people in this room"
57:55;57:56;"just at least say that"
57:56;57:57;"I look like somebody who's--"
57:57;57:58;"You do look like you're trying."
57:58;57:59;"I'm trying."
57:59;58:00;"Yeah."
58:00;58:01;"I've got more definition"
58:01;58:02;"than total slob."
58:02;58:03;"Yeah, absolutely."
58:03;58:04;"And to be fair,"
58:04;58:05;"I'm not trying to be a slob."
58:05;58:06;"I'm just trying to be a slob."
58:22;58:46;"I'm just trying to be a slob."
58:46;59:12;"I'm just trying to be a slob."
59:12;59:41;"I'm just trying to be a slob."
59:41;59:42;"I'm just trying to be a slob."
59:59;01:00:20;"I'm just trying to be a slob."
01:00:20;01:00:48;"I'm just trying to be a slob."
01:00:48;01:01:17;"I'm just trying to be a slob."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"I'm just trying to be a slob."
01:01:35;01:02:05;"I'm just trying to be a slob."
01:02:05;01:02:07;"So anyway, I have stayed true to my goals."
01:02:07;01:02:11;"When I wrote that tweet, I want to make clear to everybody that, because it is important"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"to keep my word, I wasn't trying to make a promise that the Vampire Weekend album was"
01:02:13;01:02:17;"going to come out this year or that I would be jacked this year."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"Because the truth is, those are things you aspire to."
01:02:19;01:02:21;"And here's the one thing I just want to say to everybody."
01:02:21;01:02:24;"I've needed more tweets saying 2016's almost over."
01:02:24;01:02:25;"What are you, just a liar?"
01:02:25;01:02:29;"I just want to say to everybody that I've been working very hard on those two things."
01:02:29;01:02:30;"And you know, it's tough."
01:02:30;01:02:32;"I wonder if you guys can relate to it."
01:02:32;01:02:36;"I'm sure Despot can as somebody who's famously never released an album."
01:02:36;01:02:37;"Just to be serious for a second."
01:02:37;01:02:40;"We all make big things, like movies and albums."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"These things take time and you want to nail it."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"And it's tough because you know people are waiting on it."
01:02:44;01:02:50;"But it's also tough because you can't just be writing corny updates all the time."
01:02:50;01:02:51;"It's not really my style."
01:02:51;01:02:55;"I don't want to withhold information from people, but it's also like, I don't want to"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"be like, ""Hey guys, this is Ezra."
01:02:57;01:02:59;"Today I'm rolling over to the studio."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"We got blah, blah, blah coming through."
01:03:01;01:03:02;"This is a song I started this morning."
01:03:02;01:03:04;"I can't quite nail the chorus."""
01:03:04;01:03:05;"You know what I mean?"
01:03:05;01:03:06;"What am I supposed to do?"
01:03:06;01:03:07;"I wish you did that."
01:03:07;01:03:08;"Should I do that?"
01:03:08;01:03:09;"No."
01:03:09;01:03:13;"I just want to say to everybody, in all seriousness, Time Crisis is nice because I just come in"
01:03:13;01:03:18;"every two weeks and just crack a brew with Jake, sometimes Jonah, sometimes Despot come"
01:03:18;01:03:23;"through and we just talk, man."
01:03:23;01:03:24;"Don't have to prepare."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"We got Seinfeld 2000."
01:03:25;01:03:27;"We got Nick and Colin."
01:03:27;01:03:28;"These guys help us, but we don't have to prepare."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"You know?"
01:03:29;01:03:33;"We just get to do these two to three hours of our lives every two weeks, but then in"
01:03:33;01:03:37;"between, making albums is probably the most important thing in the world to me."
01:03:37;01:03:41;"I just want everybody to know that, of course, I wish that the album could have come out"
01:03:41;01:03:45;"sooner, but I know deep down that anybody who even still cares about Vampire Weekend,"
01:03:45;01:03:48;"going four albums deep, you want the album to be good."
01:03:48;01:03:49;"You're working hard."
01:03:49;01:03:52;"You want the album to be good more than you want it now."
01:03:52;01:03:54;"I could throw together an album in a weekend."
01:03:54;01:03:55;"You wouldn't like it."
01:03:55;01:03:56;"You might like it a little."
01:03:56;01:03:57;"You might like it a little bit."
01:03:57;01:03:58;"Come on."
01:03:58;01:04:00;"We got standards to uphold."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"The Vampire Weekend has a high standard."
01:04:02;01:04:07;"The Vampire Weekend organization, we want things to be the best."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"So anyway, let's talk again next year."
01:04:09;01:04:11;"I'm going to keep putting those hours in the gym."
01:04:11;01:04:15;"Keep drinking disgusting protein shakes because you got to pack in the muscle."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"What kind of protein are you drinking?"
01:04:16;01:04:18;"So you're thinking 2019 for that record?"
01:04:18;01:04:20;"Oh, no, no, no."
01:04:20;01:04:21;"It's in good shape."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"That's all I'm going to say."
01:04:23;01:04:24;"So are you."
01:04:24;01:04:25;"I like what I've heard."
01:04:25;01:04:26;"Thank you."
01:04:26;01:04:27;"Oh, thank you, Jake."
01:04:27;01:04:28;"Yeah."
01:04:28;01:04:30;"I went vegan on the protein powder recently."
01:04:30;01:04:31;"Really?"
01:04:31;01:04:35;"Yeah, I only drink hemp protein and pumpkin and pea protein."
01:04:35;01:04:36;"Do you eat crazy healthy, Alec?"
01:04:36;01:04:37;"Hell no."
01:04:37;01:04:40;"I eat trash and I drink like a thousand beers a day."
01:04:40;01:04:45;"So how do you stay so jacked?"
01:04:45;01:04:46;"I work out every day, man."
01:04:46;01:04:50;"Well, I just want to say that I'm not jacked, but you can tell I'm trying."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"I've got more definition than I used to."
01:04:52;01:04:55;"Alec is very jacked, but he's never put out an album."
01:04:55;01:04:56;"So maybe there's a connection there."
01:04:56;01:04:57;"Sure."
01:04:57;01:05:02;"If you probably put a little more time in the studio, we probably get a despot album,"
01:05:02;01:05:03;"but you probably lose two to three packs."
01:05:03;01:05:07;"You'd probably be down to like a four and a half, five pack."
01:05:07;01:05:09;"How do you explain Dwayne Johnson then?"
01:05:09;01:05:16;"Because he's jacked and drops fire albums every year."
01:05:16;01:05:17;"He drops fire movies."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"And his covers are sick."
01:05:19;01:05:21;"He doesn't write his own stuff."
01:05:21;01:05:22;"Sorry, Rock."
01:05:22;01:05:23;"You don't write your own stuff."
01:05:23;01:05:25;"Yeah, that is time consuming."
01:05:25;01:05:28;"Most of the people who release music very consistently, I'm not naming names and it's"
01:05:28;01:05:32;"not a diss, they don't write all their own lyrics and music."
01:05:32;01:05:34;"And I don't write everything, but I write everything."
01:05:34;01:05:39;"Who's the most jacked musician who drops dope albums?"
01:05:39;01:05:42;"Because let's try and find our person we should all be aspiring to."
01:05:42;01:05:43;"It's Kanye."
01:05:43;01:05:46;"Kanye's not exactly jacked at the moment."
01:05:46;01:05:47;"That's true."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"He's not."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"He fell off a little."
01:05:49;01:05:50;"He's swole."
01:05:50;01:05:54;"Busta Rhymes is kind of the MVP of the new Tribe album and he's always jacked."
01:05:54;01:05:55;"Is he the MVP?"
01:05:55;01:05:56;"Drake."
01:05:56;01:06:00;"Okay, but Drake infamously does not write the vast majority of his lyrics."
01:06:00;01:06:04;"So all the time that, I'm not dissing him."
01:06:04;01:06:07;"I'm just saying infamously Drake's been accused."
01:06:07;01:06:10;"The Fat Boys are not jacked and they haven't released an album in a long time."
01:06:10;01:06:13;"So they're kind of slipping a little bit."
01:06:13;01:06:15;"Well, Human Beatbox is dead."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"Oh, I didn't know that."
01:06:16;01:06:17;"Sorry."
01:06:17;01:06:18;"Very, very disrespectful."
01:06:18;01:06:22;"Okay, but I'm just saying Drake is a great rapper."
01:06:22;01:06:27;"I love a lot of his music, but he famously collaborates with people on his lyrics."
01:06:27;01:06:31;"I think he's using illegal supplements for his gains as well."
01:06:31;01:06:32;"Oh, it's possible."
01:06:32;01:06:33;"Do you think Kanye does steroids?"
01:06:33;01:06:37;"He looks like Barry Bonds."
01:06:37;01:06:38;"He really does."
01:06:38;01:06:39;"Really?"
01:06:39;01:06:40;"Yeah."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"I think I've seen him with HGH and stuff."
01:06:41;01:06:46;"When I saw him at that show a month or two ago, he was so Bonds."
01:06:46;01:06:48;"HGH is like okay, kind of."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"And I think a lot of them are on that."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"Wait, should I take that?"
01:06:51;01:06:52;"I am not."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"Are you into growth hormone?"
01:06:53;01:06:54;"Yeah."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"Should I?"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"I would not recommend it."
01:06:56;01:06:57;"Have you done it?"
01:06:57;01:06:58;"No."
01:06:58;01:06:59;"Have you read Dianetics?"
01:06:59;01:07:00;"I don't give any of that stuff."
01:07:00;01:07:01;"Wait."
01:07:01;01:07:02;"Interesting."
01:07:02;01:07:03;"It might solve both of these problems and all other problems."
01:07:03;01:07:04;"Yeah."
01:07:04;01:07:05;"We got London on the track."
01:07:05;01:07:06;"This is all God's doing, man, you can't plan it."
01:07:06;01:07:07;"But if the devil's in the details, then I'm satanic."
01:07:07;01:07:08;"'Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it."
01:07:08;01:07:09;"My account say you sick and like the Titanic."
01:07:09;01:07:10;"David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish."
01:07:10;01:07:11;"I get the hits like somebody pitching underhanded."
01:07:11;01:07:12;"Got my Spanish 10 convinced."
01:07:12;01:07:13;"I'm a real man, man."
01:07:13;01:07:14;"I'm a real man."
01:07:14;01:07:20;"I'm a real man."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Got my Spanish 10 convinced that I know Spanish."
01:07:22;01:07:25;"Really when she get to talking, I don't understand it."
01:07:25;01:07:28;"You ain't on it right away, you had to wait on it."
01:07:28;01:07:31;"Man, I'm only 29, had some patients with us."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"Plus, I never met nobody from my label."
01:07:33;01:07:38;"I just pop up with the music, then they pay it."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"It ain't been the same like before."
01:07:39;01:07:40;"I still love it, but I used to love it more."
01:07:40;01:07:41;"FaceTime with my shorty on tour."
01:07:41;01:07:42;"And she takes some purple hearts, 'cause she know that we a war."
01:07:42;01:07:43;"Keep reading like it's a war."
01:07:43;01:07:44;"I got my Spanish 10 convinced."
01:07:44;01:07:45;"I'm a real man."
01:07:48;01:07:49;"I got my Spanish 10 convinced."
01:07:49;01:08:11;"Keep reaching and dancing, can't afford mistakes and I don't listen. Let me call my bros for assistance. You gon' make me call my bros for assistance. Keep reaching and
dancing, put me in a f***ing position. You gon' make me call my bros for assistance. Let me call my bros for assistance."
01:08:11;01:08:33;"Baby I'm a savage, I ain't romantic. When I come around these rappers start to panic. And they pockets going under like the Titanic. Got some h*** last night and it was
outstanding. They was hating on me then and they hating now. She was playing with me then but she waiting now. Used to sleep inside a den, I got acres now. I was fighting

01:08:33;01:08:59;"I don't pay no mind to no sneak d***. I won't spend a dime on a freak. Taking cheap shots on some cheap d***. They the type to stand in line for some free d***. Baby girl gon'

01:08:59;01:09:07;"You that d*** niching on your people huh. 21 Savage aka the reaper huh. Getting shot for all that reaching huh."
01:09:07;01:09:29;"Keep reaching and dissing. Paying for mistakes now don't listen. Make me call my bros for assistance. You gon' make me call my bros for assistance. Keep reaching and
dissing. Put me in a f***ing position. Make me call my bros for assistance. Make me call my bros."
01:09:29;01:09:44;"I don't need love I'm the GOAT. I just hit the beat and float. And I'm selling out arenas but you putting on a show. I been trying to change life around for everyone I know.
Cause if I don't share the wealth then how the f*** I'm supposed to grow. My I'm stressed there's a lot of things we need."
01:09:44;01:10:01;"Chain smoking in the house it's hard to breathe. I used to have to hit my T's with Febreze. Jordan pull up in a TL now I'm cheese. I'ma turn this TSX into a Benz soon. I'ma see
a lot of blessings from my friends soon. 150 inch screen in my bedroom."
01:10:01;01:10:16;"6'1"" man I need some leg room. It ain't been the same like before. They don't even wanna look up at the score. FaceTime with my shorty on tour. And she texting purple
hearts cause she know that we at war."
01:10:16;01:10:38;"Keep reaching and dissing. Can't afford mistakes and I don't miss em. Make me call my bros for assistance. You gon' make me call my bros for assistance. Keep reaching
and dissing. Put me in a 4th position. Make me call my bros for assistance. Make me call my bros."
01:10:38;01:10:57;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig. Beats 1. Let's get into the top 5. It's time for the top 5 on iTunes. Now you guys haven't been on the show in a while. I love this. This is where
you play the top 5."
01:10:57;01:11:17;"But I don't know if you guys have ever done one this crazy. Cause sometimes Jake and I, because Jake and I are such passionate music enthusiasts. What? You didn't know
that? The f*** are we then? You guys are property brothers. We're state property. Yeah we're the new state property."
01:11:17;01:11:36;"Well you guys are more modern guys. Jake and I love more the things of the past. Yeah but that's not what we're listening to right now. Well hold on. Something that we like
to do on this show is we compare the top 5 hits of today with the top 5 hits of 1968. Oh so it's a new thing. It's a new thing. Why is it 68? Jake you wanna take that one?"
01:11:36;01:11:52;"It's been the running theme this whole year. Just cause during the election and whatnot. Election year. Political unrest. Yeah the conventions being crazy. Just
like you know. Being a very divisive year. Right. Yeah. Alright. I'll take it. I'm buying it."
01:11:52;01:12:12;"Okay so but because this is the last time crisis of 2016. We're not just gonna do any top 5. We're gonna compare the 5 biggest number 1 hits of 1968 with the 5 biggest number
1 hits of 2016. So that means the songs that spent the most time up on top of that chart. You know what I'm saying?"
01:12:12;01:12:41;"So it's a year and wrap up for 68 and 16. 68 vs 16. And these are the songs that spent the most amount of time on top of the charts. Both rough years. So these are all very
important songs cause they went to number 1. Some more than others. But we're gonna go back and start with 1968. The number 5 song of 1968. It spent 4 weeks on the top of the
charts. It's by a guy called Otis Redding. Sitting on the dock of the bay."
01:12:41;01:13:00;"Oh it's a great song. It's kind of like a funny song for like a really f***ed up year. There's a blowfly version of it called sitting on the dock of the bay. And it's pretty
good. Rest in peace blowfly. This is so mellow. I think this was recorded like a few days before he died. Jesus. Such a beautiful song."
01:13:00;01:13:28;"This also seems like the montage for some hippies getting their heads beaten in a movie. This is definitely like a in my neighborhood type song. Like Hell's Angels just
beating the s*** out of people. The number 1 song in any movie where it's hippie is something's happening here. Oh yeah. Buffalo Squish. Also sampled by Public Enemy
for the He Got Game Sack song. Great song."
01:13:28;01:13:57;"Also a great song. He Got Game. Or Who Got Game or whatever that song is called. That's the song? Yeah. What's this song actually about? Let's spend some time. It's about
sitting on the dock of the bay. San Francisco from Georgia. Oh so did you guys know it was about San Francisco Bay? Yeah. Did you? I didn't know that. I just owned you man. I
know. I was saying you guys are not as passionate about music from the past as me and Jake."
01:13:57;01:13:59;"Oh my God. I said that."
01:13:59;01:14:06;"Wasting time."
01:14:50;01:15:10;"Does he say watching the tide roll away or watching the tire roll away? Tide. You don't know s*** about music. Yeah. Alright music guy. San Francisco Bay is not exactly
clean. That's an industrial port. So I think there's kind of like a big tire floating. Daddy watch. Yeah but this is 1968 it might have been cleaner then. It's actually
really polluted here. Very dirty. It's very dirty."
01:15:10;01:15:26;"You know what I've heard that the whistling. They did it as like a filler track. And then he was like I'll come back next week and we'll put in like some horns or something.
But then he died. But then he died in a plane crash in Wisconsin. I really like the whistling. I know they left the whistling. That's cool."
01:15:26;01:15:50;"Yo wait. I'm sure people talk about this. So this guy recorded a song called sitting on the dock of the bay. And then a few days later he died in a lake. Yeah. Jeez. Yeah I
guess the whistling was for lyrics he hadn't written yet. Oh he didn't finish the last verse. It's like the most famous part of the song. Exactly yeah. Who's saying
about that? De La Soul or something? Yeah. I think it's on the first. Also the tide doesn't roll away. A tire rolls away."
01:15:50;01:16:08;"What are you talking about man? Get out of here. You're really going in on the tire theory. It's not a tire. I like it though. I don't. I hate it. Give up. It's a tire. No I
like it. It's like the tide rolls. The tide rolls in. People say that man. Get out of here. It rolls in and rolls out. It doesn't roll away."
01:16:08;01:16:34;"Watching the tire roll away. Now the number five song. And this is interesting because normally we can it can be kind of random comparing certain weeks. But now we're
actually talking about the biggest songs of each year. Aggregate. So there's really is more power to this. The sitting on the dock of the bay of 2016. A similar year. The
sitting on the dock of the bay. Was cheap thrills by Sia."
01:16:34;01:17:02;"Up with it girl. Rock with it girl. Is there a lyric in this about a tire? My head's going to explode. It's always Uber songs man. I only know these songs from Uber. Jonas
loving it. Who produces this? This is like Major Lazer or something. Don't they use that Major Lazer noise? It's somebody ripping off Major Lazer. Right. So they
didn't actually do it. What's this song called? Cheap Thrills."
01:17:02;01:17:28;"Because they use that sound. I hate the background vocals. I love cheap thrills. Not to name drop but I'm personal friends with Sia. I like her a lot as a human being.
Sia's dope. And she writes a lot of pretty awesome songs."
01:17:28;01:17:44;"This is not one of her best. This is the first time I've ever heard this song. Really? First time? I haven't been up on my top 5 current songs. I actually only know it
because of this show. She is a great person though. Sean Paul's on it."
01:17:44;01:18:12;"Sia has written some undeniable classics. I just think she's incapable of making a bad song. She clearly has such a great ear for melody. The song's called Cheap
Thrills and it doesn't have the transcendent quality of a chandelier. I think I actually like this more than you. You like this song? I don't know why. This one's always
left me pretty cold. Do you like this more than Sitting on the Dock at the Bay? No. Close? Not even close."
01:18:12;01:18:40;"All respect to Sia. I said f*** up dude. Just said I was friends with her dude. I love cheap thrills. There's something I hate about that background vocals. I love cheap
thrills. It's pretty bad. I like that it's got a little bit of that career. It makes me want to dance. My favorite Sia song is Elastic Heart. Oh yeah with the shy in the
video? I think that video is dope. I'm not about to sing it to you."
01:18:40;01:19:04;"Someone sing it for me. Azra you're a singer. Yeah sing it. We're going back to 1968. The number 4 biggest song that spent 5 weeks at number 1 by some guys called the
Rascals, People Got to Be Free. We heard this one before. Yeah this is a perfect song for a crazy election year. Yeah it sounds sick."
01:19:04;01:19:24;"People gotta be free man."
01:19:24;01:19:48;"I like the verse too. It's about socialism. This is pretty socialist. He drops Joe Malone fragrances. You can still buy perfume for your wife. Spritz some Joe Malone on
your ladies neck."
01:19:48;01:20:14;"It's a way better background vocal. Can I say something unrelated or no? Go for it. Jump in. I just want to say RIP to Alan Thicke. That was sad. Oh yeah. Legend."
01:20:14;01:20:36;"Different strokes, facts of life, and growing pains. Those are all really good songs. Shout out to Alan Thicke. You know when you're a kid and you watch all these shows
and you don't know why but I remember growing pains was the one I liked. Me too. I don't know why I just like growing pains."
01:20:36;01:21:00;"Because Kirk Cameron before he got sus was actually really dope. I like the Hogan family. Jason Bateman. Youngest person ever to direct a TV show is Jason Bateman while
on Hogan family. Really? 17. Really good theme song too. I don't remember that theme song. Life is such a sweet. I'm sorry I got us on a bandwagon. I just wanted to give
some love."
01:21:00;01:21:22;"The equivalent of People Got to Be Free from the Rascals. People Got to Be Free. It's a great song. It's feel good. It's a little basic. A little chintzy. So think about
that. That's 1960. That's a feel good. Everything's going to be alright. Man it's so easy. Now the number 4 song of our era I think has quite a bit more to say."
01:21:22;01:21:50;"Uh oh. This is a good song. What's this? Not Playson. Black Beatles. Ray Sherman. Oh new. Should we make a mannequin challenge video right now? Yeah. Everybody. This is
a great song. Is this not new? What? It's newish but it's been on top of the charts for 5 weeks. Recently though not like in March. Yeah no it's very recent. You always
forget this one."
01:21:50;01:22:12;"These kids are geniuses. Yeah Ray Sherman incredible songwriters. I saw them play at a dive bar in Miami last week or whatever. How was it? It was great. They fell off the
table. They also didn't one of them fall off the stage and hurt himself at Governor's Ball? Yeah he split his leg open. I can't remember which one it was. Come on slow down
guys. Take care of yourself. Yeah."
01:22:12;01:22:40;"This song will always be an iconic 2016 song. A lot darker than People Gotta Be Free. We were talking earlier about how I think in the future when people make
documentaries about 2016 a very haunting moment is going to be 3 days before the election. The Hillary Clinton campaign mannequin challenge. Oh on the jet. They're on
the jet just playing this dark trap song and just like Hillary and Bill like smiling. Bill knows a little something about the lyrics to this one."
01:22:40;01:23:08;"Wait you know what I don't know anything about politics really but there's some woman who was in the mannequin challenge and the camera pans to her when they say the
lyric ""frat girls just trying to get even"" and I guess she was some kind of figure in the Hillary thing that was I don't know what her story is but someone commented like
whoever edited this was really like being funny and a lot of people aren't going to catch."
01:23:08;01:23:37;"Like she was trying to get even? She was some kind of frat girl trying to get even. Wow. I don't know who she is. Is it frat girl? Yeah. What does that mean? Like a frat dude?
Well frat girl is a crowd pleaser and then yeah frat girl is trying to get even I think. I guess he just didn't want it. Sorority girl didn't fit. Okay. But let's keep it
real. Copy that. We do our best to write lyrics. We try to provide meaning but sometimes you say frat girl. I intuited the meaning. Right."
01:23:37;01:24:05;"I feel like you could say frat girl because a frat girl might just be at a frat party. Yeah she's not even in a sorority. Okay true. Oh okay. Great song. Clearly better than
""People Got to Be Free"" and ""No Disrespect to the Rascals"" and such a weird iconic. I just always think you know when Adam Curtis makes his 2016 documentary about the
year that America fell apart it'll be like this is a story."
01:24:06;01:24:09;"About a system that was failing."
01:24:09;01:24:14;"The Clinton campaign. Bala."
01:24:14;01:24:20;"And he'll be frozen while he's singing. It'll just be a narration. It'll just be all these mannequin challenges."
01:24:20;01:24:33;"The mannequin challenge in itself is disturbing. Like it's real weird. It's like that Kanye video. I totally miss the mannequin challenge. People just kind of
freeze. You play this song and then everyone just freezes."
01:24:33;01:24:45;"I know this song is unsettling. And they were doing it on the Clinton plane? Yeah. Was Hillary doing it? Yeah. It was her like way to be like I'm up on pop culture. I know
what's going on. And they were playing this song and Hillary was like no."
01:24:45;01:24:56;"Hundreds of thousands of people pretended to be mannequins. They thought they were autonomous people with their own hopes and desires. But this was a fantasy."
01:24:56;01:24:59;"You gotta keep going."
01:25:00;01:25:19;"The systems of. They don't start moving until. The systems of power that had taken over the earth. Still going. A sense of reality. A sense of deep despair. A deep
individualism. But this was a fantasy."
01:25:21;01:25:35;"Okay. Back to 1968. I never heard of this guy Paul Moriarty. You familiar? No. No. This song, Love is Blue, spent five weeks on the charts at number one in 1968. I don't
think it's been on Time Crisis this year."
01:25:35;01:25:47;"Oh dude, this is the famous Liberace song. Is it in the movie? Of course man. But this is. It's kind of got a Tarantino vibe. It was in Love Story too."
01:25:49;01:26:02;"Oh is it instrumental? Yeah Liberace does like the greatest cover of this song. I don't know which one came first. This is so Tarantino too. Shoshanna! This is the
famous Liberace song, Love is Blue."
01:26:02;01:26:15;"We have to let people know that Jonah's a major Liberace head and was actually Liberace for Halloween. That's true. Well Liberace specifically from Behind the
Candelabra and my friend was Matt Damon and my other friend was Rob Lowe."
01:26:16;01:26:31;"So it was a three person costume. It's so funny that there used to be. It was unbelievable. You guys were all on a path together. We weren't but it was a true costume that no
one got and then when I went home early and my boy dressed as Matt Damon had to go out and try and hit on people after. By himself."
01:26:31;01:26:45;"Did not work at all. He's like I'm the Matt Damon character from Behind the Candelabra. I don't think it worked very well. But this is one of my favorite songs, the
Liberace version. It's amazing. It's crazy that stuff like this used to top the charts."
01:26:45;01:26:55;"Love is Blue. Alright. Is that a harpsichord? You gotta hear the Liberace version. It's incredible. It's incredible. On your free time."
01:26:55;01:27:12;"Liberace Love is Blue. Check it out people. The number three song of 2016. This one also has a lot in common with Black Beatles. It's really cool. It makes you want to move
but also has a vague sense of unease. Also be good for the Adam Curtis documentary."
01:27:13;01:27:32;"That's like trap music though. Right? Yeah. The Systems of Power. This is like some social network. Yeah. Atticus Ross. I like this one dude. Great song. This is
probably one of the best songs of the year."
01:27:33;01:27:53;"Is this the original version of the song? Yeah. This is number one for nine weeks. Rihanna work. You see the YouTube ukulele covers that white girls do? Of this song?
Yeah. And then they try to do the patois and it's very funny. That'd be like slowly singing. Ukulele covers are whack as f***. Very bad. So sweaty."
01:27:54;01:28:12;"It's like the sweaty cover you've ever seen in your entire life. Okay. Hold on. Hold on a second. I know he passed away but if the God... Is? No. Israel. Yeah. That's Is. We
talked about him in voice. He's a legend. Is is one of the few people who ever was actually dope and rocked a ukulele."
01:28:13;01:28:34;"Oh no. There are tiny team at ukulele. There are people who had ukuleles who are dope. I'm saying like the specific like twee fake Zooey Deschanel covers of songs are
whack. The problem is it all just sounds like a Target commercial now. Right. Maybe like 15 years ago there was something kind of fresh about it. That's the term right?
Twee? Yeah."
01:28:35;01:28:49;"Kind of like. Yeah. Twee. Like cute indie fake. Yes. Which 15 years ago maybe had like a slight self-aware or like ironic edge to it but now is fully Target."
01:28:50;01:29:03;"Oh, I never know. Never neglect you. I mean who am I to hold your past against you? I just hope that it gets to you. I hope that you see this through. I hope that you see this
through."
01:29:04;01:29:23;"What can I say? Please recognize I'm trying baby. I say wah wah wah wah wah wah wah. You see me do my da da da da da da. Somebody wah wah wah wah wah. When you walk out la la la la
la. When the cash from my tur tur tur tur."
01:29:24;01:29:43;"I'm hoping Gary Puckett's gonna be in the top five. This is like some Hollywood country. Right."
01:29:44;01:30:03;"See the tree how big it's grown. But friend it hasn't been too long. It wasn't big. It wasn't big. I laughed at her and she got mad. The first day that she planted it was just
a twig."
01:30:04;01:30:19;"Is this funny to you guys? The song? Yeah. What's he talking about? Planting a tree. Making fun of someone for planting a tree because it was so small."
01:30:20;01:30:31;"It just seems like kind of like corny Harry Nielsen. Yeah. A little bit. Almost like Rick Nelson. Yeah. But like ten years after."
01:30:31;01:30:40;"That's something Ghostface killer talked about. Smart dumb people. That was a big Ghostface thing. Timeless theme. Yeah."
01:30:41;01:30:51;"We would be fair to say Ghostface is this dude of his day. Bobby Goldsboro. Bobby Goldsboro. Rap game Bobby Goldsboro."
01:30:51;01:31:02;"Does this song have a chorus? No I don't think so. Just a story song. Yeah. This song sucks. Oh. I would agree. Yeah."
01:31:03;01:31:12;"This is in keeping with our explanation of 68 this year. You guys literally are saying that Honey by Bobby Goldsboro sucks? I think so yeah."
01:31:12;01:31:20;"Spent five weeks on top of the chart. It's like a cute little story about how this girl planted a tree and the guy was like that tree's whack. It's never going to be a tree."
01:31:20;01:31:31;"And then it became a tree. You planted a tree. First of all. Not a foregone conclusion. Not every tree that gets planted. Sure but like come on."
01:31:32;01:31:34;"You know the end of the story? No."
01:31:34;01:31:44;"She died or something? I'm actually struggling with the tree I planted. She died and buried her under the tree. The tree fell on her."
01:31:44;01:31:52;"Wait what did you say about trees? I'm struggling right now with the tree I planted. I planted a lime tree. Where like in your backyard? Yeah like four months ago."
01:31:53;01:32:02;"Does that make fun of you for planting it? No but it's not working out and actually today I researched it and I added a bunch of sulfur and iron into the soil."
01:32:02;01:32:12;"How do you just put iron into the soil? There's a bag with these little pellets of iron. You're polluting the earth man. No I'm not man. Iron's an element."
01:32:12;01:32:20;"It's going back into the earth. You're putting hard metals into the soil. The problem was that the soil was too alkaline. It needed to be more acidic."
01:32:22;01:32:33;"Man this is the type of stuff we gotta learn for the future. Imagine if you didn't have Google and your family depended on those limes."
01:32:33;01:32:38;"He's surprised it was a puppy. Honey? Yeah."
01:32:38;01:32:49;"Okay nobody likes Honey by Bobby Goldsboro but let's go back to 2016. Do you like Drake featuring Wizkid and Kyla? Ten weeks at number one."
01:32:50;01:32:53;"Monster hit. How many weeks did Bobby Goldsboro have? Five."
01:32:53;01:33:03;"I'm surprised Controlla wasn't a big hit. I mean it's a popular song on the album but I'm surprised it wasn't this level of a big hit."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"Maybe if it came first."
01:33:05;01:33:16;"I think maybe Honey was a dog. Oh you're looking up the lyrics? Did you cheat on him?"
01:33:17;01:33:22;"Either Honey left him or Honey was a dog. I can't believe we're still talking about Honey."
01:33:22;01:33:27;"The first note came, she ran out. Those country songs always have a twist in the last verse."
01:33:27;01:33:33;"The angels came. Whoever Honey is she died but I think it was."
01:33:42;01:33:47;"Is she saying style? Stuff. Stuff? I like your stuff. Style."
01:33:47;01:33:55;"You know this was a song. It was a big UK club hit. Right. Maybe she is saying stuff."
01:33:55;01:34:04;"Yep. Stuff. Definitely stuff."
01:34:04;01:34:11;"Very materialist song but as we found out today just because somebody is materialist doesn't necessarily mean they're capitalist."
01:34:12;01:34:17;"Because under socialism you could still like somebody's stuff and purchase it for a fair and reasonable price in the marketplace."
01:34:17;01:34:19;"It's style."
01:34:19;01:34:27;"One Dance is a great song but it's like I never found myself listening to it in my off time."
01:34:27;01:34:31;"How many of these top five songs would you listen to in your off time?"
01:34:31;01:34:38;"Black Beatles before you couldn't stop hearing it. Because I just like Ray Shremmer so I like Black Beatles."
01:34:38;01:34:40;"Word."
01:34:40;01:34:44;"I like Black Beatles and Work Better Than One Dance if I'm being honest."
01:34:44;01:34:47;"Let's go back to 1968. Are you guys ready for the..."
01:34:47;01:34:49;"Are we doing number one now?"
01:34:49;01:34:54;"Yeah this is the number one song of 1968 that spent nine weeks at number one."
01:34:54;01:34:56;"Hey!"
01:34:56;01:35:06;"That's right. Can you believe that? 2016 the year of Black Beatles. 1968 the year of regular Beatles."
01:35:07;01:35:13;"So in the year of Black Beatles Trump is elected. In the year of regular Beatles Nixon is elected."
01:35:13;01:35:15;"Some parallels."
01:35:15;01:35:19;"This was a diss track against John Lennon."
01:35:19;01:35:22;"It was."
01:35:22;01:35:27;"John Lennon, no I think actually it's supposed to be he's writing a song to Julian Lennon."
01:35:27;01:35:29;"Yeah but he's like your dad's whack. Sorry."
01:35:29;01:35:35;"It is and then John wrote that song How Do You Sleep At Night."
01:35:36;01:35:37;"That was like you."
01:35:37;01:35:39;"That's such a dope song."
01:35:39;01:35:43;"It's like the first fire diss track."
01:35:43;01:35:45;"It's a straight diss track."
01:35:45;01:35:50;"That's where John Lennon famously coined the phrase don't ever talk to me or my son again."
01:35:50;01:35:58;"Because he couldn't believe that Paul would first of all go talk to his son and get intel against him and then turn into a hit song for the Beatles."
01:35:58;01:36:03;"Although to be fair John Lennon was laughing all the way to the bank because he got 50% of the publishing on this song."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"One thing about this song that's interesting."
01:36:06;01:36:14;"A lot of these old songs they have these very long intros but Paul McCartney always a businessman was like people are going to like this song more."
01:36:14;01:36:16;"I'm a businessman."
01:36:16;01:36:21;"He said people don't want to hear all sorts of love is blue gushy strings."
01:36:21;01:36:24;"They don't want to hear that Bobby Goldsboro honey no chorus stuff."
01:36:24;01:36:30;"They want to hear my voice from the jump and they want a big fat chorus."
01:36:30;01:36:35;"Hey Jude don't make it bad."
01:36:35;01:36:41;"Take a sad song and make it better."
01:36:41;01:36:44;"So he's saying like I'm sorry your dad made you sad."
01:36:44;01:36:45;"Yeah."
01:36:45;01:36:47;"If your dad was a real man."
01:36:47;01:36:50;"Chin up kid your dad sucks but what are you going to do."
01:36:50;01:36:52;"Jeez."
01:36:52;01:36:54;"Yeah."
01:36:54;01:36:56;"He probably should have minded his own business."
01:36:56;01:36:58;"Yeah I think so."
01:36:59;01:37:02;"Remember when we met this guy."
01:37:02;01:37:04;"Yes."
01:37:04;01:37:12;"We were together when we shook Paul McCartney's hand and it was in like an empty ass room because we all got to the party first at the plaza."
01:37:12;01:37:14;"Yeah."
01:37:14;01:37:15;"That was cool."
01:37:15;01:37:17;"He was like hi I'm SNL."
01:37:17;01:37:19;"Yeah we talked about that."
01:37:19;01:37:22;"It was weird for Paul McCartney to be like hi I'm Paul because what do you."
01:37:22;01:37:24;"Yeah I know man."
01:37:24;01:37:26;"Don't introduce yourself."
01:37:26;01:37:28;"You're like what's your name again."
01:37:28;01:37:29;"I mean I was glad he said hi."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"He knew."
01:37:31;01:37:33;"Nah yeah he was a nice guy."
01:37:33;01:37:35;"You know what's crazy."
01:37:35;01:37:37;"This song was not on an album."
01:37:37;01:37:39;"Standalone single."
01:37:39;01:37:53;"Well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool by making his world a little colder."
01:37:54;01:38:06;"He was supposed to come in the next day and put lyrics over that."
01:38:06;01:38:08;"Great song."
01:38:08;01:38:10;"Yeah."
01:38:10;01:38:12;"Royal Tenenbaums opening is like this used as score."
01:38:12;01:38:14;"Oh yeah."
01:38:14;01:38:16;"The whole opening like introducing all them."
01:38:16;01:38:18;"Yeah."
01:38:18;01:38:19;"With Alec Baldwin."
01:38:19;01:38:21;"I don't remember that."
01:38:21;01:38:23;"Yeah."
01:38:23;01:38:25;"He's a rapper I like right now called Nolan B. Rowling."
01:38:25;01:38:27;"Nolan B. Rowling."
01:38:27;01:38:32;"Yeah and he has a line where he says I play it with the birds call me Mordecai."
01:38:32;01:38:34;"It's pretty good."
01:38:34;01:38:39;"Birds meaning a lot of coke."
01:38:39;01:38:42;"Royal Tenenbaums very hot in the hip hop community now."
01:38:42;01:38:44;"Yeah."
01:38:44;01:38:46;"All Lil Yachty's videos have the Wes Anderson look."
01:38:46;01:38:48;"Yeah."
01:38:48;01:38:50;"And then the rest of the song is just the nah nah nah."
01:38:50;01:38:52;"Yeah because he's supposed to come in the next day."
01:38:52;01:38:53;"Or."
01:38:53;01:38:55;"But he died."
01:38:55;01:38:57;"Or was this him taunting John."
01:38:57;01:38:59;"Right."
01:38:59;01:39:00;"It's like nah nah nah nah."
01:39:00;01:39:02;"His tongue out."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"They just jammed the hell out of this."
01:39:04;01:39:09;"He really seemed like a nice guy you know you wouldn't expect him to make a horrible diss track like this about someone's child."
01:39:09;01:39:12;"Didn't Kanye say something about Wiz and Amber's child once."
01:39:12;01:39:14;"Yeah."
01:39:14;01:39:17;"A lot of people consider that to be over the line but he and Paul McCartney are friends."
01:39:17;01:39:20;"The worst is the Jay Z now to be."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"Yeah."
01:39:22;01:39:24;"Condoms in the car seat."
01:39:24;01:39:26;"Yeah that was a little crazy."
01:39:26;01:39:28;"Wait what does that mean."
01:39:28;01:39:30;"People got upset about that."
01:39:30;01:39:32;"What does it mean."
01:39:32;01:39:34;"Well what there was the more and Carmen thing."
01:39:34;01:39:36;"Wasn't it all part."
01:39:36;01:39:38;"Wait what."
01:39:38;01:39:40;"That one was having sex."
01:39:40;01:39:43;"I forgot which one was which but which rapper did what but one was having sex with someone's baby mama and the line was that they left condoms in."
01:39:43;01:39:45;"You got it."
01:39:45;01:39:47;"Yeah."
01:39:47;01:39:49;"Oh so like like Nas was getting in the car."
01:39:50;01:39:51;"That was the morning Carmen drive to Dunkin Donuts."
01:39:51;01:39:57;"Then he just kind of like looked over and just saw these like used condoms in the car seat."
01:39:57;01:40:03;"And he was like my baby's mother asked to borrow the car last night but she said she was going to hang out with friends."
01:40:03;01:40:05;"Yeah."
01:40:05;01:40:09;"But then she's actually going to meet Jay Z and he had sex with her in the car with the child stuff around."
01:40:09;01:40:11;"Yeah."
01:40:11;01:40:13;"And who knows if that condom you know held up."
01:40:13;01:40:15;"So who knows whose kid that is."
01:40:15;01:40:18;"I guess that's I guess you could call that he didn't really disrespectful."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"He brought a basketball player into it I think too."
01:40:21;01:40:25;"He was like not only did I have sex with her but also this guy."
01:40:25;01:40:27;"I think there was I don't remember."
01:40:27;01:40:29;"But they patched things up."
01:40:29;01:40:31;"Yeah."
01:40:33;01:40:34;"Who won that beef guys."
01:40:34;01:40:36;"Jay Z."
01:40:36;01:40:38;"Yeah."
01:40:40;01:40:41;"The takeover right."
01:40:41;01:40:43;"Yeah."
01:40:43;01:40:45;"Either was like not that because on the takeover not everybody knows that they got the dude from saliva is singing the backup vocals."
01:40:46;01:40:47;"Yeah."
01:40:47;01:40:49;"Because like they didn't want to pay the doors."
01:40:49;01:40:51;"So they recreated it."
01:40:51;01:40:53;"So I think it's a great song."
01:40:53;01:40:56;"Once Jay Z came through with Josie from saliva."
01:40:56;01:41:01;"It was a rap because Nas had no connections in that community."
01:41:01;01:41:05;"He had the guy from modest mouse saying I don't even know saliva."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"What is I don't even know that."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"They were a band of that era."
01:41:09;01:41:11;"They were good."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"I'm not mad at them."
01:41:14;01:41:16;"I'm not mad at them for not having a punch line but that guy from saliva."
01:41:16;01:41:18;"He also did a little act."
01:41:18;01:41:21;"And he did a little acting."
01:41:21;01:41:26;"And he also I mean it's so random that he sings back up on the Jay Z song but it's cool."
01:41:26;01:41:31;"But then he also did the infamous duet with Chad from Nickelback from Spider-Man."
01:41:31;01:41:34;"I think that hero could save me."
01:41:34;01:41:37;"Chad from Nickelback."
01:41:37;01:41:40;"That was Nickelback."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"It was Iverson was the basketball player."
01:41:43;01:41:44;"Yeah he also had sex with me."
01:41:44;01:41:46;"I got more in Carmen."
01:41:46;01:41:49;"Wait Carmen was the name of the baby mama."
01:41:49;01:41:51;"The singer of Nickelback is named Chad."
01:41:51;01:41:53;"Yeah you didn't know that."
01:41:53;01:41:55;"I thought you were a rock dude."
01:41:55;01:41:57;"No I'm a rock dude."
01:41:57;01:41:59;"You don't like Canadian rock."
01:41:59;01:42:01;"Kind of a blind spot Nickelback."
01:42:01;01:42:03;"They have a few tunes."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"Look at this photograph."
01:42:05;01:42:07;"Yeah good impression."
01:42:07;01:42:10;"Yeah he in his Bentley backseat skeeded in his Jeep."
01:42:11;01:42:13;"Left condoms on his baby seat."
01:42:13;01:42:15;"Yeah me and the boy AI."
01:42:15;01:42:17;"Not a family show today."
01:42:17;01:42:19;"Me and the boy AI got more in common than just balling and rhyming."
01:42:19;01:42:21;"Get it more in Carmen."
01:42:21;01:42:23;"I don't know."
01:42:23;01:42:25;"It was Carmen Bryan."
01:42:25;01:42:27;"The mother of Nas's daughter."
01:42:27;01:42:30;"That's pretty witty but first of all you shouldn't have dragged her into it."
01:42:30;01:42:32;"Well that's you know."
01:42:32;01:42:34;"Well look."
01:42:34;01:42:36;"Look at this photo."
01:42:36;01:42:39;"Paul set the precedent back with the Hey Jude."
01:42:40;01:42:42;"Whatever behind the scenes that song is about."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"It's a classic song."
01:42:44;01:42:50;"Now to be fair a lot of the 2016 songs have been better than the 68 songs."
01:42:50;01:42:52;"Old is not always better."
01:42:52;01:42:55;"Black Beatles is better than People Gotta Be Free."
01:42:55;01:42:57;"So do you think."
01:42:57;01:42:59;"I think we're in kind of a tie ball game here."
01:42:59;01:43:01;"It's kind of a tie ball game."
01:43:01;01:43:03;"Do you think that the number one song of 2016."
01:43:03;01:43:06;"This song spent 12 incredible weeks at the top of the charts."
01:43:06;01:43:08;"Is better than Hey Jude."
01:43:09;01:43:10;"All my friends are heathens."
01:43:10;01:43:12;"No that was not that does not in the top five."
01:43:12;01:43:14;"Oh that's not."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"Thank Christ."
01:43:16;01:43:18;"OK well we can talk about it."
01:43:18;01:43:20;"That's another Uber."
01:43:20;01:43:22;"The Hey Jude of 2016."
01:43:22;01:43:24;"The Beatles of 2016."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"I got to figure this out."
01:43:26;01:43:28;"What wait what is it one of the is it a weekend song."
01:43:28;01:43:30;"No good."
01:43:30;01:43:32;"No not a Dell not weekend."
01:43:32;01:43:34;"We've listened to it on the show probably."
01:43:34;01:43:36;"Yes."
01:43:36;01:43:37;"No it's too Caucasian males."
01:43:38;01:43:39;"Yep."
01:43:39;01:43:41;"The Beatles of 2016."
01:43:41;01:43:43;"Congratulations to the chain smokers."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"And the Hey Jude of the modern era."
01:43:45;01:43:47;"Is closer."
01:43:47;01:43:49;"Featuring Halsey."
01:43:49;01:43:51;"This is Uber too."
01:43:51;01:43:53;"It was an Uber year."
01:43:53;01:43:57;"How come Uber Everywhere is not in the top five."
01:43:57;01:44:04;"The left wing had become untethered from its belief system."
01:44:05;01:44:06;"The song sucks."
01:44:06;01:44:16;"I know it breaks your heart."
01:44:16;01:44:21;"Who's this."
01:44:21;01:44:23;"Chain smokers."
01:44:23;01:44:25;"You know this song."
01:44:25;01:44:27;"Yeah."
01:44:27;01:44:29;"It's really not my thing."
01:44:29;01:44:30;"It's really not my thing."
01:44:30;01:44:35;"Well give it a chance."
01:44:35;01:44:37;"You haven't heard the drop yet."
01:44:37;01:44:44;"You lost me with like Rover."
01:44:44;01:44:46;"Yeah."
01:44:46;01:44:48;"But listen to the story he's giving important details."
01:44:48;01:44:51;"Stop trying to make me like something I don't like."
01:44:51;01:44:53;"Give it a chance man."
01:44:53;01:44:55;"It's like to call a range."
01:44:55;01:44:57;"Are you telling me what I like."
01:44:58;01:44:59;"Chain smokers."
01:44:59;01:45:00;"Listen to the drop."
01:45:00;01:45:05;"Oh man."
01:45:05;01:45:08;"Is this like."
01:45:08;01:45:09;"Is this akin to 21 pilots."
01:45:09;01:45:11;"No."
01:45:11;01:45:13;"This is."
01:45:13;01:45:14;"These guys are more."
01:45:14;01:45:15;"They're like kind of like DJ producers."
01:45:15;01:45:17;"This is more like pop EDM."
01:45:17;01:45:19;"Despot are you more down with chain smokers or 21 pilots."
01:45:19;01:45:21;"Damn."
01:45:21;01:45:23;"Probably chain smokers because I can't really."
01:45:23;01:45:25;"I just can't even bear the 21 pilots."
01:45:25;01:45:27;"But they rap."
01:45:27;01:45:28;"Yeah."
01:45:28;01:45:30;"That which is like way more offensive."
01:45:30;01:45:32;"At least it's not rapping."
01:45:32;01:45:34;"I guess it's nice to not be alone in the studio."
01:45:34;01:45:36;"Just ripping on chance."
01:45:36;01:45:38;"Smokers and 21 pilots."
01:45:38;01:45:40;"Got a shout out."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"People hate me for that."
01:45:42;01:45:44;"Halsey."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"That's the name of my junior high school."
01:45:46;01:45:48;"Really."
01:45:48;01:45:49;"Yes."
01:45:49;01:45:50;"Those street in Brooklyn."
01:45:50;01:45:52;"Yeah that's true."
01:45:52;01:45:54;"Shout out to Halsey."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"She's from New Jersey."
01:45:56;01:45:57;"Well I didn't have time."
01:45:57;01:45:59;"This song 12 weeks at number one."
01:45:59;01:46:01;"This was the song of the year."
01:46:01;01:46:03;"That's too bad."
01:46:03;01:46:05;"So you could say what you want."
01:46:05;01:46:07;"Mannequin challenge."
01:46:07;01:46:09;"Drake."
01:46:09;01:46:11;"Sia."
01:46:11;01:46:13;"You can make all sorts of cases for your favorite album."
01:46:13;01:46:15;"It's been a weird year."
01:46:15;01:46:17;"This and that."
01:46:17;01:46:19;"But there's only one song that was at the top of the charts for 12 weeks."
01:46:20;01:46:21;"This is our hey Jude."
01:46:21;01:46:23;"You know what I'm saying."
01:46:23;01:46:25;"We weren't alive back in 68."
01:46:25;01:46:27;"But it's not my hey Jude."
01:46:27;01:46:29;"This is your hey Jude."
01:46:29;01:46:31;"Not my president."
01:46:31;01:46:33;"Not my hey Jude."
01:46:33;01:46:35;"My president is Trump."
01:46:35;01:46:37;"And I'm not Trump."
01:46:37;01:46:39;"I'm not Trump."
01:46:48;01:46:49;"My president is Trump."
01:46:49;01:46:51;"Chainsmokers is my..."
01:46:51;01:46:53;"My song is hey Jude."
01:46:53;01:46:55;"My president is Trump."
01:46:55;01:46:57;"Closer is my hey Jude."
01:46:57;01:46:59;"I mean guys this is..."
01:46:59;01:47:01;"Depressing."
01:47:01;01:47:03;"This is our life man."
01:47:03;01:47:05;"This is 2016."
01:47:05;01:47:07;"I don't know guys."
01:47:07;01:47:09;"Play something else."
01:47:09;01:47:11;"I feel like it's going to be hard to stay in touch after we graduate."
01:47:11;01:47:13;"So funny."
01:47:13;01:47:15;"That's exactly what I was thinking in my head."
01:47:15;01:47:17;"Like prom or something like that."
01:47:17;01:47:18;"I thought you liked it."
01:47:18;01:47:20;"No."
01:47:20;01:47:24;"Okay so..."
01:47:24;01:47:26;"Let me come into your river."
01:47:26;01:47:28;"Yeah that's so bad."
01:47:28;01:47:30;"Call it a range."
01:47:30;01:47:32;"Wait but that's..."
01:47:32;01:47:34;"Okay Alec hop out the range."
01:47:34;01:47:36;"Alec first of all you know these guys are from New York."
01:47:36;01:47:38;"I thought you normally stick up for people who are from New York."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"Are they from New York?"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"One of them is."
01:47:42;01:47:43;"Where?"
01:47:43;01:47:45;"Upper West Side I think."
01:47:46;01:47:47;"I don't really like people from the Upper West Side."
01:47:47;01:47:49;"Except Lacutus."
01:47:49;01:47:51;"Isn't he from like Washington Heights?"
01:47:51;01:47:53;"I don't really know."
01:47:53;01:47:55;"Wait is it Wicky from the Upper West Side?"
01:47:55;01:47:57;"Yeah okay Wicky too."
01:47:57;01:47:59;"Whatever I like some people from the Upper West Side."
01:47:59;01:48:01;"Not that one."
01:48:01;01:48:03;"Lyrically closer is on another level."
01:48:03;01:48:05;"Like hey Jude."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"Literally?"
01:48:07;01:48:09;"Lyrically."
01:48:09;01:48:11;"Oh I just said literally."
01:48:11;01:48:13;"Like hey Jude has a more interesting structure with a kind of long outro."
01:48:13;01:48:15;"But at the end of the day it's just hey Jude this and that."
01:48:15;01:48:16;"But lyrically closer with the details."
01:48:16;01:48:18;"It paints a picture in a much more literary way."
01:48:18;01:48:20;"What's the picture?"
01:48:20;01:48:22;"He's making love to somebody in the backseat of her Rover."
01:48:22;01:48:24;"A lot of car sex on this episode."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"He's making love to somebody in the backseat of her Rover."
01:48:26;01:48:28;"But he's not in the moment."
01:48:28;01:48:30;"He's thinking about the fact that she can't even afford this car."
01:48:30;01:48:32;"Very symbolic of America."
01:48:32;01:48:34;"How does it go?"
01:48:34;01:48:36;"I didn't even notice that."
01:48:36;01:48:38;"No come on."
01:48:38;01:48:40;"Okay I won't play it."
01:48:40;01:48:42;"He says so baby."
01:48:43;01:48:45;"Hold me closer in the backseat of your Rover."
01:48:45;01:48:47;"That I know you can't afford."
01:48:47;01:48:49;"Like the tattoo on your shoulder."
01:48:49;01:48:51;"And your roommate back in Boulder."
01:48:51;01:48:53;"Been the ninest then in Dolar."
01:48:53;01:48:55;"And I'm fattest in Dakota."
01:48:55;01:48:57;"She can't afford it."
01:48:57;01:48:59;"And he ain't at Chipotle."
01:48:59;01:49:01;"And then we ain't never getting older."
01:49:01;01:49:03;"Oh okay."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"She can't afford the tattoo on her shoulder."
01:49:05;01:49:07;"She's working at Chipotle."
01:49:09;01:49:11;"She's got the roommate back in Boulder."
01:49:12;01:49:13;"With the mattress on the floor."
01:49:13;01:49:16;"As systems of power and government ground to a halt."
01:49:16;01:49:19;"It appeared that time had stopped."
01:49:19;01:49:21;"It was as if we were never getting older."
01:49:21;01:49:24;"But this was a fantasy."
01:49:24;01:49:27;"I got one last question."
01:49:27;01:49:29;"Anybody can jump in who wants to tackle it."
01:49:29;01:49:32;"What does it mean to you that the biggest song of the year."
01:49:32;01:49:34;"That's been 12 weeks."
01:49:34;01:49:36;"Number one."
01:49:36;01:49:38;"If you had to boil it down to a phrase."
01:49:38;01:49:40;"The chorus is we ain't never getting older."
01:49:41;01:49:42;"It means like this moment is forever."
01:49:42;01:49:45;"We're going to stay in this moment forever."
01:49:45;01:49:47;"It's a lie."
01:49:47;01:49:49;"Head in the sand."
01:49:49;01:49:51;"Jonah's interpretation is very terrifying."
01:49:51;01:49:53;"That means that the feeling of the country."
01:49:53;01:49:55;"It means like they're Benjamin Button."
01:49:55;01:49:58;"The chain smokers are like little Benjamin Buttons."
01:49:58;01:50:00;"That are like born a thousand years old."
01:50:00;01:50:03;"And then they're like I'm seven but I'm looking a lot older."
01:50:03;01:50:05;"So I guess the chain smokers."
01:50:05;01:50:08;"It's kind of like we are kind of trapped in an eternal present."
01:50:10;01:50:12;"Society seems to have ground to a halt."
01:50:12;01:50:15;"We were kind of raised to believe that things would get better and better."
01:50:15;01:50:17;"More rights would be gained."
01:50:17;01:50:20;"People would be living having living at a higher level."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"And it's kind of fitting that."
01:50:22;01:50:24;"America stopped growing this year."
01:50:24;01:50:29;"Because even we all admit that America has always been pretty bad for most people."
01:50:29;01:50:32;"We're not trying to pretend it was ever amazing."
01:50:32;01:50:36;"But there was always some sense that small things were getting better that we were on a path."
01:50:36;01:50:38;"Rising upward."
01:50:39;01:50:44;"And I think it's fair to say that this is the year that that one of the biggest bites out of that dream was ever tooken."
01:50:44;01:50:49;"So it kind of makes sense that the biggest song of the year."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"Would be one about."
01:50:51;01:50:54;"Wrecking that we're never getting older."
01:50:54;01:50:56;"America stopped getting older."
01:50:56;01:51:00;"And the poets who brought this to us were the chain smokers."
01:51:00;01:51:02;"And Halsey don't forget about Halsey."
01:51:03;01:51:04;"You're listening to."
01:51:04;01:51:06;"Time Crisis."
01:51:06;01:51:08;"On Beats 1."
01:51:08;01:51:10;"What a time crisis."
01:51:10;01:51:12;"What a time to be alive."
01:51:12;01:51:14;"What a time to crisis to laugh."
01:51:14;01:51:16;"It's been a really rough year."
01:51:16;01:51:18;"For everybody."
01:51:18;01:51:21;"Even though the future doesn't look very bright."
01:51:21;01:51:24;"We still got to at least keep educating ourselves."
01:51:24;01:51:26;"Learning about different ideologies."
01:51:26;01:51:28;"That maybe will help us get out of this mess."
01:51:28;01:51:30;"If not socialism."
01:51:31;01:51:36;"Maybe some kind of chain smoker featuring Halsey type of liberalism."
01:51:36;01:51:39;"What's your feeling about 2017?"
01:51:39;01:51:41;"What's your gut feeling?"
01:51:41;01:51:44;"People almost are superstitious the way they talk about 2016."
01:51:44;01:51:47;"Yeah but I think a lot of superstition is rooted in."
01:51:47;01:51:51;"There were so many celebrity important celebrity deaths."
01:51:51;01:51:54;"And that is not really a result of a bunch of bad decisions."
01:51:54;01:51:56;"It's just people happen to die this year."
01:51:57;01:52:01;"Luckily most of the celebrity deaths were people over 60, 65."
01:52:01;01:52:03;"Yeah but people are still alive."
01:52:03;01:52:05;"I feel like it's going to keep happening next year."
01:52:05;01:52:07;"People dying?"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"Yeah like boomer celebrities."
01:52:09;01:52:12;"Well no I mean just like old boomer celebrities."
01:52:12;01:52:16;"I guess it's kind of funny that in a year where the biggest song kept saying we ain't never getting older."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"A lot of famous people died."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"Because they got old."
01:52:20;01:52:22;"I feel like a lot of famous people just die every year."
01:52:22;01:52:24;"It always feels that way."
01:52:25;01:52:27;"People are taking it particularly hard this year."
01:52:27;01:52:29;"Because everything else is bad I guess."
01:52:29;01:52:31;"And we lost Prince."
01:52:31;01:52:33;"Which is like probably the biggest L ever."
01:52:33;01:52:35;"True legend."
01:52:35;01:52:37;"David Bowie too."
01:52:37;01:52:39;"Let's end this on a positive note."
01:52:41;01:52:43;"Because everybody."
01:52:43;01:52:45;"That might be tough."
01:52:45;01:52:47;"It might be tough but you know we're leading into Christmas."
01:52:47;01:52:49;"The holiday break."
01:52:49;01:52:51;"Everybody's going to go spend time with family and loved ones."
01:52:51;01:52:53;"That's a good thing."
01:52:54;01:52:55;"It's a good thing to be positive."
01:52:55;01:52:58;"Even when the world is looking bad."
01:52:58;01:53:00;"That's a constant theme of this show."
01:53:00;01:53:02;"The reason."
01:53:02;01:53:04;"Like I said before we don't put a lot of."
01:53:04;01:53:06;"We don't do a lot of research for this show."
01:53:06;01:53:10;"We don't do a lot of fancy library books or anything."
01:53:10;01:53:12;"We come on this show and talk."
01:53:12;01:53:14;"And just hang out."
01:53:14;01:53:16;"Crack some modellos."
01:53:16;01:53:19;"Talk about fast food."
01:53:19;01:53:21;"Pop songs."
01:53:21;01:53:23;"Classic rock."
01:53:23;01:53:24;"Socialism."
01:53:24;01:53:26;"Because at the end of the day that's what life is about."
01:53:26;01:53:28;"It's about hanging out."
01:53:28;01:53:30;"That's an official time crisis ideology."
01:53:30;01:53:33;"That life is really just about hanging out."
01:53:33;01:53:35;"So I say to everybody."
01:53:35;01:53:37;"It's the end of the year."
01:53:37;01:53:39;"You have a well deserved break."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"You go hang out with your friends, family."
01:53:41;01:53:43;"Boyfriends, girlfriends."
01:53:43;01:53:45;"Lovers."
01:53:45;01:53:47;"Make love in rovers."
01:53:47;01:53:49;"Just chat."
01:53:49;01:53:51;"Just hang out."
01:53:52;01:53:53;"Have sex in the range."
01:53:53;01:53:55;"I want to change the lyrics."
01:53:55;01:53:58;"That would actually be classic."
01:53:58;01:54:01;"If there's a rap verse and they wanted you to basically just recapitulate it."
01:54:01;01:54:03;"Both sides of the words."
01:54:03;01:54:05;"Hey."
01:54:05;01:54:07;"Going to stay the same age."
01:54:07;01:54:09;"Have sex in the range."
01:54:09;01:54:11;"Something about like Colorado."
01:54:11;01:54:13;"Alright well."
01:54:13;01:54:15;"Even though Closer is the biggest song of the year."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"I think the song that captured the feeling of the year the most."
01:54:17;01:54:19;"Was Black Beatles."
01:54:19;01:54:21;"So let's just say goodbye to everybody."
01:54:21;01:54:22;"Let's just up."
01:54:22;01:54:24;"Hang out for the next couple weeks."
01:54:24;01:54:26;"And then we'll see you in January."
01:54:26;01:54:30;"This was a fantasy."
01:54:31;01:54:32;"[Laughter]"
01:54:33;01:54:34;"Black Beatles in the city."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"Be back immediately."
01:54:36;01:54:38;"To confiscate the money."
01:54:40;01:54:42;"Grace girl."
01:54:42;01:54:44;"I will."
01:54:44;01:54:47;"Seeing flowers but you said you didn't see."
01:54:47;01:54:50;"Just like real men."
01:54:50;01:54:54;"That girl is a real crowd pleaser."
01:54:54;01:54:57;"Small world all her friends know of me."
01:54:57;01:55:00;"Young bull living like an old geezer."
01:55:01;01:55:04;"Quit release the cash watch it fall slowly."
01:55:04;01:55:07;"Frat girl still trying to get even."
01:55:07;01:55:10;"Haters mad for whatever reason."
01:55:10;01:55:12;"Smoke in the air."
01:55:12;01:55:14;"Binge drinking."
01:55:14;01:55:17;"They lose it when the DJ drops the knee."
01:55:17;01:55:20;"Getting so gone I'm not blinking."
01:55:20;01:55:23;"What in the world was I thinking?"
01:55:23;01:55:26;"New day new money to be made."
01:55:26;01:55:30;"There is nothing to explain."
01:55:30;01:55:33;"I'm a black beetle cream seats in the regal."
01:55:33;01:55:36;"Rocking giant linden lenses like to see them spread."
01:55:36;01:55:40;"Eagle took a beer to the club and let a party on the table."
01:55:40;01:55:42;"Screaming everybody's famous."
01:55:42;01:55:44;"I like clockwork I blow it all."
01:55:44;01:55:47;"Then get some more."
01:55:47;01:55:50;"Get you somebody that can do both."
01:55:50;01:55:53;"Black Beatles got the bass belly rolling."
01:55:53;01:55:55;"She thinks she love me."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"I think she trolling."
01:55:58;01:56:00;"That girl is a real crowd please."
01:56:00;01:56:03;"Small world all her friends know of me."
01:56:03;01:56:06;"Young bull living like an old geezer."
01:56:06;01:56:09;"Quit release the cash watch it fall slowly."
01:56:09;01:56:13;"Frat girl still trying to get even."
01:56:13;01:56:16;"Haters mad for whatever reason."
01:56:16;01:56:18;"Smoke in the air."
01:56:18;01:56:20;"Binge drinking."
